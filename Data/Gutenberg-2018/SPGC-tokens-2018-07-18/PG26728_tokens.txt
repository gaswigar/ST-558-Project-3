there
is

about

at

seems
colorless
dreary
lethargic
what
can
our
soul

in

that
of
an

a

worships

lived
and

in

our

shall
as

come
right
in
and
set
down
i
was
jest
wishin
i
had
somebody
to
talk
to
take
that
chair
right
by
the
door
so
you
can
get
the
breeze
and
aunt
jane
beamed
at
me
over
her
spectacles
and
hitched
her
own
chair
a
little
to
one
side
in
order
to
give
me
the
full
benefit
of
the
wind
that
was
blowing
softly
through
the
window
and
carrying
into
the
room
the
heavenliest
odors
from
a
field
of
clover
that
lay
in
full
bloom
just
across
the
road
for
it
was
june
in
kentucky
and
clover
and
were
running
sweet
riot
over
the
face
of
the
earth
aunt
jane
and
her
room
together
always
carried
me
back
to
a
dead
and
gone
generation
there
was
a
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
of
the
pattern
the
chairs
were
ancient
shaker
rockers
some
with
homely
shuck
bottoms
and
each
had
a
tidy
of
snowy
thread
or
crochet
cotton
fastened
primly
over
the
back
the
high
bed
and
bureau
and
a
shining
mahogany
table
suggested
an
era
of
plain
living
far
far
remote
from
the
day
of
turkish
rugs
and
japanese
and
aunt
jane
was
in
perfect
correspondence
with
her
environment
she
wore
a
purple
calico
dress
rather
short
and
scant
a
gingham
apron
with
a
capacious
pocket
in
which
she
always
carried
knitting
or
some
other
handy
work
a
white
handkerchief
was
laid
primly
around
the
wrinkled
throat
and
fastened
with
a
pin
containing
a
lock
of
gray
hair
her
cap
was
of
black
lace
and
lutestring
ribbon
not
one
of
the
butterfly
affairs
that
perch
on
the
top
of
the
puffs
and
frizzes
of
the
modern
old
lady
but
a
substantial
structure
that
covered
her
whole
head
and
was
tied
securely
under
her
chin
she
talked
in
a
sweet
old
treble
with
a
little
lisp
caused
by
the
absence
of
teeth
and
her
laugh
was
as
clear
and
joyous
as
a
young
girl
yes
i
quilts
again
she
said
snipping
away
at
the
bits
of
calico
in
her
lap
i
did
say
i
was
done
with
that
sort
o
work
but
this
mornin
i
was
rummagin
around
up
in
the
garret
and
i
come
across
this
bundle
of
pieces
and
thinks
i
reckon
it
intended
for
me
to
piece
one
more
quilt
before
i
die
i
must
put
there
thirty
years
ago
and
clean
forgot
and
i
been
settin
here
all
the
evenin
cuttin
and
thinkin
about
old
times
jest
feel
o
that
she
continued
tossing
some
scraps
into
my
lap
there
ai
any
such
caliker
nowadays
this
ai
your
stuff
that
fades
in
the
first
washin
and
wears
out
in
the
second
a
caliker
dress
was
somethin
worth
buyin
and
worth
makin
up
in
them
days
that
piece
was
a
dress
i
got
the
spring
before
abram
died
when
i
put
on
mournin
it
was
as
good
as
new
and
i
give
it
to
sister
mary
that
one
with
the
green
ground
and
white
figger
was
my
niece
rebecca
she
wore
it
for
the
first
time
to
the
county
fair
the
year
i
took
the
premium
on
my
bread
and
sponge
cake
this
piece
sally
ann
flint
give
me
i
ricollect
was
in
blackberry
time
and
i
been
out
in
the
big
pasture
pickin
some
for
supper
and
i
stopped
in
at
sally
ann
for
a
drink
o
water
on
my
way
back
she
was
cuttin
out
this
dress
aunt
jane
broke
off
with
a
little
soprano
laugh
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
sally
ann
experience
she
said
as
she
laid
two
pieces
together
and
began
to
sew
with
her
slender
nervous
old
fingers
to
find
aunt
jane
alone
and
in
a
reminiscent
mood
this
was
delightful
do
tell
me
i
said
aunt
jane
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
she
always
made
this
pause
before
beginning
a
story
and
there
was
something
impressive
about
it
i
used
to
think
she
was
making
an
invocation
to
the
goddess
of
memory
was
forty
years
ago
she
began
musingly
and
the
way
of
it
was
this
our
church
was
considerably
out
o
fix
it
needed
a
new
roof
some
o
the
winder
lights
was
out
and
the
floor
was
as
bare
as
your
hand
and
always
had
been
the
men
folks
managed
to
git
the
roof
shingled
and
the
winders
fixed
and
us
women
in
the
mite
society
concluded
we
git
a
cyarpet
we
been
savin
up
our
money
for
some
time
and
we
had
about
twelve
dollars
i
ricollect
what
a
argument
we
had
for
some
of
us
wanted
the
cyarpet
and
some
wanted
to
give
it
to
furrin
missions
as
we
set
out
to
do
at
first
sally
ann
was
the
one
that
settled
it
she
says
at
last
sally
ann
was
in
favor
of
the
cyarpet
she
says
if
any
of
the
heathen
fails
to
hear
the
gospel
on
account
of
our
gittin
this
cyarpet
they
be
saved
anyhow
so
parson
page
says
and
if
we
send
the
money
and
they
do
hear
the
gospel
like
as
not
they
wo
repent
and
then
they
certain
to
be
damned
and
it
seems
to
me
as
long
as
we
ai
sure
what
do
we
might
as
well
keep
the
money
and
git
the
cyarpet
i
never
did
see
much
sense
anyhow
says
she
givin
people
a
chance
to
damn
theirselves
well
we
decided
to
take
sally
ann
advice
and
we
was
talkin
about
a
committee
to
go
to
town
the
follerin
monday
and
pick
out
the
cyarpet
when
all
at
once
taylor
she
was
our
treasurer
she
spoke
up
and
says
she
ai
any
use
that
committee
the
money
gone
she
says
sort
o
short
and
quick
kept
it
in
my
top
bureau
drawer
and
when
i
went
for
it
yesterday
it
was
gone
i
pay
it
back
if
i
ever
able
but
i
ai
able
now
and
with
that
she
got
up
and
walked
out
o
the
room
before
any
one
could
say
a
word
and
we
seen
her
goin
down
the
road
lookin
straight
before
her
and
walkin
right
fast
and
we
we
set
there
and
stared
at
each
other
in
a
sort
o
dazed
way
i
could
see
that
everybody
was
thinkin
the
same
thing
but
nobody
said
a
word
till
our
minister
wife
she
was
as
good
a
woman
as
ever
lived
she
says
them
two
words
was
jest
like
a
sermon
to
us
then
sally
ann
spoke
up
and
says
the
lord
sake
do
let
the
men
folks
know
anything
about
this
they
always
sayin
that
women
ai
fit
to
handle
money
and
i
for
one
do
want
to
give
any
more
ground
to
stand
on
than
they
already
got
so
we
agreed
to
say
nothin
about
it
and
all
of
us
kept
our
promise
except
milly
amos
she
had
mighty
little
sense
to
begin
with
and
havin
been
married
only
about
two
months
she
about
lost
that
little
so
next
mornin
i
happened
to
meet
sam
amos
and
he
says
to
me
jane
how
much
money
have
you
women
got
the
new
cyarpet
for
the
church
i
looked
him
square
in
the
face
and
i
says
you
a
member
of
the
ladies
mite
society
of
goshen
church
sam
amos
for
if
you
are
you
already
know
how
much
money
we
got
and
if
you
ai
you
got
no
business
knowin
and
furthermore
says
i
some
women
that
ca
keep
a
secret
and
a
promise
and
some
that
can
and
can
and
that
settled
well
never
showed
her
face
outside
her
door
for
a
month
afterwards
and
a
more
creatur
you
never
saw
than
she
was
when
she
come
out
to
the
night
sally
ann
give
her
experience
she
set
back
in
the
church
and
she
was
as
pale
and
peaked
as
if
she
had
been
through
a
siege
of
typhoid
i
ricollect
it
all
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday
we
sung
hour
of
prayer
and
parson
page
prayed
and
then
called
on
the
brethren
to
say
anything
they
might
feel
called
on
to
say
concernin
their
experience
in
the
past
week
old
uncle
jim
matthews
begun
to
clear
his
throat
and
i
knew
as
well
as
i
knew
my
name
he
was
fixin
to
git
up
and
tell
how
precious
the
lord
had
been
to
his
soul
jest
like
been
doin
every
wednesday
night
for
twenty
years
but
before
he
got
started
here
come
walkin
down
the
side
aisle
and
stopped
right
in
front
o
the
pulpit
somethin
to
say
she
says
been
on
my
mind
till
i
stand
it
any
longer
i
got
to
tell
it
or
i
go
crazy
it
was
me
that
took
that
cyarpet
money
i
only
meant
to
borrow
it
i
thought
sure
i
be
able
to
pay
it
back
before
it
was
wanted
but
things
went
wrong
and
i
ai
known
a
peaceful
minute
since
and
never
shall
again
i
reckon
i
took
it
to
pay
my
way
up
to
louisville
the
time
i
got
the
news
that
mary
was
dyin
mary
was
her
daughter
by
her
first
husband
you
see
begged
jacob
to
give
me
the
money
to
go
on
says
she
he
would
do
it
i
tried
to
give
up
and
stay
but
i
jest
could
mary
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
and
maybe
you
that
has
children
can
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
know
what
it
would
be
to
hear
your
only
child
callin
to
you
from
her
and
you
not
able
to
go
to
her
i
asked
jacob
three
times
for
the
money
she
says
when
i
found
he
give
it
to
me
i
said
to
myself
i
goin
anyhow
i
got
down
on
my
knees
says
she
asked
the
lord
to
show
me
a
way
and
i
felt
sure
he
would
as
soon
as
jacob
had
eat
his
breakfast
and
gone
out
on
the
farm
i
dressed
myself
and
as
i
opened
the
top
bureau
drawer
to
get
out
my
best
collar
i
saw
the
missionary
money
it
come
right
into
my
head
says
she
maybe
this
was
the
answer
to
my
prayer
maybe
i
could
borrow
this
money
and
pay
it
back
some
way
or
other
before
it
was
called
for
i
tried
to
put
it
out
o
my
head
but
the
thought
kept
comin
back
and
when
i
went
down
into
the
to
get
jacob
cyarpetbag
to
carry
a
few
things
in
i
happened
to
look
up
at
the
mantelpiece
and
saw
the
brass
candlesticks
with
prisms
all
that
used
to
belong
to
my
mother
and
all
at
once
i
seemed
to
see
jest
what
the
lord
intended
for
me
to
do
know
she
says
had
a
boarder
summer
before
last
that
lady
from
louisville
and
she
wanted
them
candlesticks
the
worst
kind
and
offered
me
fifteen
dollars
for
i
would
part
with
then
but
she
said
if
ever
i
wanted
to
sell
to
let
her
know
and
she
left
her
name
and
address
on
a
cyard
i
went
to
the
big
bible
and
got
out
the
cyard
and
i
packed
the
candlesticks
in
the
cyarpetbag
and
put
on
my
bonnet
when
i
opened
the
door
i
looked
up
the
road
and
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
dave
crawford
comin
along
in
his
new
buggy
i
went
out
to
the
gate
and
he
drew
up
and
asked
me
if
i
was
goin
to
town
and
said
he
take
me
it
looked
like
the
lord
was
leadin
me
all
the
time
says
she
the
way
things
turned
out
it
must
been
satan
i
got
to
mary
just
two
hours
before
she
died
and
she
looked
up
in
my
face
and
says
mother
i
knew
god
would
let
me
die
till
seen
you
once
more
here
aunt
jane
took
off
her
glasses
and
wiped
her
eyes
i
ca
tell
this
without
cryin
to
save
my
life
said
she
but
never
shed
a
tear
she
looked
like
she
got
past
cryin
and
she
talked
straight
on
as
if
she
made
up
her
mind
to
say
jest
so
much
and
she
die
if
she
did
git
to
say
it
soon
as
the
funeral
was
over
says
she
set
out
to
find
the
lady
that
wanted
the
candlesticks
she
was
at
home
but
her
niece
was
there
and
said
she
heard
her
aunt
speak
of
the
candlesticks
often
and
she
be
home
in
a
few
days
and
would
send
me
the
money
right
off
i
come
home
thinkin
it
was
all
right
and
i
kept
the
money
every
day
but
it
never
come
till
day
before
yesterday
i
wrote
three
times
about
it
but
i
never
got
a
word
from
her
till
monday
she
had
just
got
home
she
said
and
hoped
i
had
been
inconvenienced
by
the
delay
she
wrote
a
nice
polite
letter
and
sent
me
a
check
for
fifteen
dollars
and
here
it
is
i
wanted
to
confess
it
all
that
day
at
the
mite
society
but
somehow
i
could
till
i
had
the
money
right
in
my
hand
to
pay
back
if
the
lady
had
only
come
back
when
her
niece
said
she
was
comin
it
would
all
have
turned
out
right
but
i
reckon
it
a
judgment
on
me
for
meddling
with
the
money
god
only
knows
what
i
suffered
says
she
if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again
i
believe
i
do
it
mary
was
all
the
child
i
had
in
the
world
and
i
had
to
see
her
once
more
before
she
died
i
been
a
member
of
this
church
for
twenty
years
says
she
i
reckon
you
have
to
turn
me
out
now
the
pore
thing
stood
there
tremblin
and
holdin
out
the
check
as
if
she
expected
somebody
to
come
and
take
it
old
silas
petty
was
glowerin
at
her
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
pharisees
and
the
woman
they
wanted
to
stone
and
i
ricollect
thinkin
if
the
lord
jesus
would
jest
come
in
and
take
her
part
and
while
we
all
set
there
like
a
passel
o
mutes
sally
ann
got
up
and
marched
down
the
middle
aisle
and
stood
right
by
you
know
what
funny
thoughts
people
will
have
sometimes
well
i
felt
so
relieved
it
popped
into
my
head
all
at
once
that
we
did
need
the
lord
after
all
sally
ann
would
do
jest
as
well
it
seemed
sort
o
like
sacrilege
but
i
could
help
it
well
sally
ann
looked
all
around
as
composed
as
you
please
and
says
she
reckon
if
anybody
turned
out
o
this
church
on
account
that
miserable
little
money
it
be
jacob
and
not
a
man
that
wo
give
his
wife
money
to
go
to
her
dyin
child
is
too
mean
to
stay
in
a
christian
church
anyhow
and
i
like
to
know
how
it
is
that
a
woman
that
had
eight
hundred
dollars
when
she
married
has
to
go
to
her
husband

she
goodness

jest
here
old
deacon
petty
rose
up
and
says
he
and
he
spread
his
arms
out
and
waved
up
and
down
like
he
was
goin
to
pray
this
is
awful
if
this
woman
wants
to
give
her
religious
experience
why
says
he
very
kind
and
condescendin
course
she
can
do
so
but
when
it
comes
to
a
standin
up
in
the
house
of
the
lord
and
revilin
an
elder

silence
in
the
church
as
soon
as
he
named
the
paul
sally
ann
give
a
kind
of
snort
sally
ann
was
terrible
and
when
deacon
petty
said
that
she
jest
squared
herself
like
she
intended
to
stand
there
till
judgment
day
and
says
she
paul
has
been
dead
ruther
too
long
for
me
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
i
never
heard
of
him
deacon
petty
to
represent
him
in
this
church
if
the
paul
do
like
what
i
sayin
let
him
rise
up
from
his
grave
in
corinthians
or
ephesians
or
wherever
he

a
message
from
the
lord
to
the
men

of
this
church
and
goin
to
deliver
it
paul
or
no
paul
says
she
as
for
you
silas
petty
i
ai
forgot
the
time
i
dropped
in
to
see
maria
one
saturday
night
and
found
her
washin
out
her
flannel
petticoat
and
dryin
it
before
the
fire
and
every
time
i
had
to
hear
you
lead
in
prayer
since
then
i
said
to
myself
lord
how
high
can
a
prayers
rise
toward
heaven
when
his
wife
ai
got
but
one
flannel
skirt
to
her
name
no
higher
than
the
back
of
his
pew
if
you
let
me
tell
it
i
knew
jest
how
it
was
said
sally
ann
well
as
if
maria
told
me
she
been
havin
the
milk
and
butter
money
from
the
old
roan
cow
she
raised
from
a
little
heifer
and
jest
because
feed
was
scarce
you
sold
her
off
before
maria
had
money
enough
to
buy
her
winter
flannels
i
can
give
my
experience
can
i
well
jest
what
i
says
she
while
i
about
it
says
she
give
in
some
experience
for
and
maria
and
the
rest
of
the
women
who
betwixt
their
husbands
an
the
paul
have
about
lost
all
the
gumption
and
grit
that
the
lord
started
them
out
with
if
the
paul
says
she
got
anything
to
say
about
a
woman
workin
like
a
slave
for
years
and
then
havin
to
set
up
an
wash
out
her
clothes
saturday
night
so
she
can
go
to
church
clean
sunday
mornin
i
like
to
hear
it
but
do
you
dare
to
say
anything
to
me
about
keepin
silence
in
the
church
there
was
times
when
paul
says
he
did
know
whether
he
had
the
spirit
of
god
or
not
and
i
certain
that
when
he
wrote
that
text
he
was
any
more
inspired
than
you
are
silas
petty
when
you
tell
maria
to
shut
her
mouth
job
taylor
was
settin
right
in
front
of
deacon
petty
and
i
reckon
he
thought
his
time
was
comin
next
so
he
gets
up
with
his
red
bandanna
to
his
mouth
and
starts
out
but
sally
ann
headed
him
off
before
he
gone
six
steps
and
says
she
anything
the
matter
with
you
job
taylor
you
set
right
down
and
hear
what
i
got
to
say
i
knelt
and
stood
through
enough
o
your
prayers
and
now
it
my
time
to
talk
and
yours
to
listen
and
bless
your
life
if
job
did
set
down
as
meek
as
moses
and
sally
ann
lit
right
into
him
and
says
she
reckon
you
afraid
i
tell
some
o
your
meanness
ai
you
and
the
only
thing
that
stands
in
my
way
is
that
there
so
much
to
tell
i
do
know
where
to
begin
there
ai
a
woman
in
this
church
says
she
do
know
how
marthy
scrimped
and
worked
and
saved
to
buy
her
a
new
set
furniture
and
how
you
took
the
money
with
you
when
you
went
to
cincinnata
the
spring
before
she
died
and
come
back
without
the
furniture
and
when
she
asked
you
for
the
money
you
told
her
that
she
and
everything
she
had
belonged
to
you
and
that
your
mother
old
furniture
was
good
enough
for
anybody
it
my
belief
says
she
what
killed
marthy
women
are
dyin
every
day
and
the
doctors
will
tell
you
it
some
disease
or
other
when
if
the
truth
was
known
it
nothin
but
wantin
somethin
they
git
and
hopin
and
waitin
for
somethin
that
never
comes
watched
and
i
know
the
night
before
marthy
died
she
says
to
me
sally
ann
says
she
i
could
die
a
heap
peacefuler
if
i
jest
knew
the
front
room
was
fixed
up
right
with
a
new
set
of
furniture
for
the
funeral
and
sally
ann
her
finger
right
at
job
and
says
she
said
it
then
and
i
say
it
now
to
your
face
job
taylor
you
killed
marthy
the
same
as
if
you
taken
her
by
the
throat
and
choked
the
life
out
of
her
mary
embry
job
was
settin
right
behind
me
and
i
heard
her
say
as
fervent
as
if
somebody
had
been
prayin
job
set
there
lookin
like
a
dog
and
sally
ann
went
right
on
know
says
she
law
gives
you
the
right
to
your
earnin
and
everything
they
got
down
to
the
clothes
on
their
backs
and
i
always
said
there
was
some
kentucky
law
that
was
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
encouragin
men
in
their
natural
meanness
a
in
which
the
lord
knows
they
do
need
no
encouragin
there
some
men
says
she
sneak
behind
the
paul
when
they
plannin
any
meanness
against
their
wives
and
some
that
runs
to
the
law
and
you
one
of
the
law
kind
but
mark
my
words
says
she
of
these
days
you
men
who
been
stealin
your
wives
property
and
defraudin
and
cheatin
out
o
their
just
dues
you
have
to
stand
before
a
judge
that
cares
mighty
little
for
kentucky
law
and
all
the
law
and
all
the
scripture
you
can
bring
up
wo
save
you
from
goin
where
the
rich
man
went
i
can
see
sally
ann
right
now
and
aunt
jane
pushed
her
glasses
up
on
her
forehead
and
looked
with
a
dreamy
retrospective
gaze
through
the
doorway
and
beyond
where
swaying
elms
and
maples
were
whispering
softly
to
each
other
as
the
breeze
touched
them
she
had
on
her
old
black
and
some
black
yarn
mitts
and
she
did
come
nigh
up
to
job
shoulder
but
job
set
and
listened
as
if
he
jest
i
heard
dave
crawford
shufflin
his
feet
and
clearin
his
throat
while
sally
ann
was
talkin
to
job
dave
farm
sally
ann
and
they
had
a
lawsuit
once
about
the
way
a
fence
ought
to
run
and
sally
ann
beat
him
he
always
despised
sally
ann
after
that
and
used
to
call
her
a
sally
ann
heard
the
shufflin
and
as
soon
as
she
got
through
with
job
she
turned
around
to
dave
and
says
she
you
think
your
hemmin
and
scrapin
is
goin
to
stop
me
dave
crawford
you
one
o
the
men
that
makes
me
think
that
it
better
to
be
a
kentucky
horse
than
a
kentucky
woman
many
the
time
says
she
seen
pore
july
with
her
head
tied
up
crawlin
around
tryin
to
cook
for
sixteen
harvest
hands
and
you
out
in
the
stable
cossetin
up
a
sick
mare
and
rubbin
down
your
to
get
in
trim
for
the
fair
of
all
the
things
that
hard
to
understand
says
she
hardest
is
a
man
that
has
more
mercy
on
his
horse
than
he
has
on
his
wife
july
found
rest
at
last
says
she
in
the
graveyard
and
every
time
i
pass
your
house
i
thank
the
lord
that
you
got
to
pay
a
good
price
for
your
cookin
now
as
there
ai
a
woman
in
the
country
fool
enough
to
step
into
july
shoes
but
la
said
aunt
jane
breaking
off
with
her
happy
laugh
the
laugh
of
one
who
revels
in
rich
memories
what
the
use
of
me
tellin
all
this
stuff
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
sally
ann
had
her
say
about
nearly
every
man
in
the
church
she
told
how
mary
embry
had
to
cut
up
her
weddin
skirts
to
make
clothes
for
her
first
baby
and
how
john
martin
stopped
hannah
one
day
when
she
was
carryin
her
mother
a
pound
of
butter
and
made
her
go
back
and
put
the
butter
down
in
the
cellar
and
how
lije
davison
used
to
make
ann
pay
him
for
every
bit
of
chicken
feed
and
then
take
half
the
egg
money
because
the
chickens
got
into
his
garden
and
how
abner
page
give
his
wife
cents
for
spendin
money
the
time
she
went
to
visit
her
sister
sally
ann
always
was
a
masterful
sort
of
woman
and
that
night
it
seemed
like
she
was
possessed
the
way
she
talked
made
me
think
of
the
day
of
pentecost
and
the
gift
of
tongues
and
finally
she
got
to
the
minister
i
been
wonderin
all
along
if
she
was
goin
to
let
him
off
she
turned
around
to
where
he
was
settin
under
the
pulpit
and
says
she
page
you
a
good
man
but
you
ai
so
good
you
could
be
better
it
was
jest
last
week
says
she
the
women
come
around
beggin
money
to
buy
you
a
new
suit
of
clothes
to
go
to
presbytery
in
and
i
told
if
it
was
to
get
mis
page
a
new
dress
i
was
ready
to
give
but
not
a
dime
was
i
goin
to
give
towards
puttin
finery
on
a
man
back
i
tired
o
seein
the
ministers
walk
up
into
the
pulpit
in
their
slick
black
broadcloths
and
their
wives
settin
down
in
the
pew
in
an
old
black
silk
that
been
turned
upside
down
wrong
side
out
and
hind
part
before
and
sponged
and
pressed
and
made
over
till
you
ca
tell
whether
it
silk
or
caliker
or
what
well
i
reckon
there
was
some
o
the
women
that
expected
the
roof
to
fall
down
on
us
when
sally
ann
said
that
right
to
the
minister
but
it
did
fall
and
sally
ann
went
straight
on
when
it
comes
to
the
perseverance
of
the
saints
and
the
decrees
of
god
says
she
ai
many
can
preach
a
better
sermon
but
there
some
of
your
sermons
says
she
ai
fit
for
much
but
kindlin
fires
there
that
one
you
preached
last
sunday
on
the
verse
of
the
fifth
chapter
of
ephesians
i
reckon
i
heard
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
sermons
on
that
text
and
i
reckon
i
keep
on
hearin
as
long
as
there
ai
anybody
but
men
to
do
the
preachin
anybody
would
think
says
she
you
preachers
was
struck
blind
every
time
you
git
through
with
the
verse
for
i
never
heard
a
sermon
on
the
verse
i
believe
there
men
in
this
church
that
thinks
the
fifth
chapter
of
ephesians
has
got
but
verses
and
i
goin
to
read
the
rest
of
it
to
for
once
anyhow
and
if
sally
ann
did
walk
right
up
into
the
pulpit
same
as
if
she
been
ordained
and
read
what
paul
said
about
men
lovin
their
wives
as
christ
loved
the
church
and
as
they
loved
their
own
bodies
says
she
brother
page
can
reconcile
these
texts
with
what
paul
says
about
women
submittin
and
bein
subject
he
welcome
to
do
it
but
says
she
i
had
the
preachin
to
do
i
would
waste
time
reconcilin
i
jest
say
that
when
paul
told
women
to
be
subject
to
their
husbands
in
everything
he
was
inspired
and
when
he
told
men
to
love
their
wives
as
their
own
bodies
he
was
inspired
and
like
to
see
the
presbytery
that
could
silence
me
from
preachin
as
long
as
i
wanted
to
preach
as
for
turnin
out
o
the
church
says
she
like
to
know
who
to
do
the
turnin
out
when
the
disciples
brought
that
woman
to
christ
there
was
a
man
in
the
crowd
fit
to
cast
a
stone
at
her
and
if
there
any
man
nowadays
good
enough
to
set
in
judgment
on
a
woman
his
name
ai
on
the
rolls
of
goshen
church
if
says
she
as
much
common
sense
as
got
conscience
she
know
that
the
matter
o
that
money
concern
nobody
but
our
mite
society
and
we
women
can
settle
it
without
any
help
from
you
deacons
and
elders
well
i
reckon
parson
page
thought
if
he
did
head
sally
ann
off
some
way
or
other
she
go
on
all
night
so
when
she
kind
o
stopped
for
breath
and
shut
up
the
big
bible
he
grabbed
a
and
says
us
sing
blest
be
the
tie
that
binds
he
struck
up
the
tune
himself
and
about
the
middle
of
the
first
verse
mis
page
got
up
and
went
over
to
where
was
standin
and
give
her
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
then
mis
petty
did
the
same
and
first
thing
we
knew
we
was
all
around
her
shakin
hands
and
huggin
her
and
cryin
over
her
was
a
and
we
went
home
feelin
like
we
been
through
a
big
protracted
meetin
and
got
religion
over
again
was
a
week
till
was
down
with
slow
fever
nervous
collapse
old
pendleton
called
it
we
took
turns
nursin
her
and
one
day
she
looked
up
in
my
face
and
says
i
know
now
what
the
mercy
of
the
lord
is
here
aunt
jane
paused
and
began
to
cut
pieces
out
of
a
square
of
flowered
chintz
the
quilt
was
to
be
of
the
pattern
there
was
a
drowsy
hum
from
the
near
the
window
and
the
shadows
were
lengthening
as
sunset
approached
one
queer
thing
about
it
she
resumed
was
that
while
sally
ann
was
talkin
not
one
of
us
felt
like
laughin
we
set
there
as
solemn
as
if
parson
was
preachin
to
us
on
and
predestination
but
whenever
i
think
about
it
now
i
laugh
fit
to
kill
and
i
thought
many
a
time
that
sally
ann
plain
talk
to
them
men
done
more
good
than
all
the
sermons
us
women
had
had
preached
to
us
about
and
ourselves
to
our
husbands
for
every
one
o
them
women
come
out
in
new
clothes
that
spring
and
such
a
change
as
it
made
in
some
of
i
would
be
surprised
if
she
did
have
a
message
to
deliver
jest
as
she
said
the
bible
says
an
ass
spoke
up
once
and
reproved
a
man
and
i
reckon
if
an
ass
can
reprove
a
man
so
can
a
woman
and
it
looks
to
me
like
men
stand
in
need
of
reprovin
now
as
much
as
they
did
in
balaam
days
jacob
died
the
follerin
fall
and
got
shed
of
her
troubles
the
triflin
scamp
never
married
her
for
anything
but
her
money
things
is
different
from
what
they
used
to
be
she
went
on
as
she
folded
her
pieces
into
a
compact
bundle
and
tied
it
with
a
piece
of
gray
yarn
my
was
tellin
me
last
summer
how
a
passel
women
kept
goin
up
to
frankfort
and
so
pesterin
the
legislatur
that
they
had
to
change
the
laws
to
git
rid
of
so
married
women
now
has
all
the
property
rights
they
want
and
some
of
has
sense
to
use
i
reckon
how
about
you
and
uncle
abram
i
suggested
did
sally
ann
say
anything
about
you
in
her
experience
aunt
jane
black
eyes
snapped
with
some
of
the
fire
of
her
youth
la
no
child
she
said
abram
never
was
that
kind
of
a
man
and
i
never
was
that
kind
of
a
woman
i
ricollect
as
we
was
home
that
night
abram
says
sort
o
had
you
better
git
that
brown
merino
you
was
lookin
at
last
county
court
day
and
i
says
you
worry
about
that
brown
merino
abram
in
my
bottom
drawer
right
now
i
told
the
storekeeper
to
cut
it
off
jest
as
soon
as
your
back
was
turned
and
mis
simpson
is
to
make
it
next
week
and
abram
he
jest
laughed
and
says
jane
i
never
saw
your
beat
you
see
i
never
was
any
hand
at
myself
to
my
husband
like
some
women
i
often
wondered
if
abram
would
been
jest
like
silas
petty
if
i
been
like
maria
i
noticed
that
whenever
a
woman
willin
to
be
imposed
upon
there
always
a
man
standin
ready
to
do
the
imposin
i
never
went
to
a
to
find
out
what
my
rights
was
i
did
my
duty
faithful
to
abram
and
when
i
wanted
anything
i
went
and
got
it
and
abram
paid
for
it
and
i
ca
see
but
what
we
got
on
jest
as
well
as
we
done
if
i
myself
longer
and
longer
grew
the
shadows
and
the
faint
tinkle
of
bells
came
in
through
the
windows
the
cows
were
beginning
to
come
home
the
spell
of
aunt
jane
dramatic
art
was
upon
me
i
began
to
feel
that
my
own
personality
had
somehow
slipped
away
from
me
and
those
dead
people
evoked
from
their
graves
by
an
old
woman
histrionism
seemed
more
real
to
me
than
my
living
breathing
self
there
now
i
talked
you
clean
to
death
she
said
with
a
happy
laugh
as
i
rose
to
go
but
we
had
a
real
nice
time
and
i
glad
you
come
the
sun
was
almost
down
as
i
walked
slowly
away
when
i
looked
back
at
the
turn
of
the
road
aunt
jane
was
standing
on
the
shading
her
eyes
and
peering
across
the
level
fields
i
knew
what
it
meant
beyond
the
fields
was
a
bit
of
woodland
and
in
one
corner
of
that
you
might
if
your
eyesight
was
good
discern
here
and
there
a
glimpse
of
white
it
was
the
old
of
goshen
church
and
i
knew
by
the
strained
attitude
and
intent
gaze
of
the
watcher
in
the
door
that
somewhere
in
the
sunlit
space
between
aunt
jane
and
the
little
country
graveyard
the
souls
of
the
living
and
the
dead
were
keeping
a
silent
tryst
illustration
ii
the
new
organ
illustration
gittin
a
new
organ
is
a
mighty
different
thing
nowadays
from
what
it
was
when
i
was
young
said
aunt
jane
judicially
as
she
lifted
a
panful
of
yellow
harvest
apples
from
the
table
and
began
to
peel
them
for
dumplings
potatoes
peas
and
asparagus
were
bubbling
on
the
stove
and
the
dumplings
were
in
honor
of
the
invited
guest
who
had
begged
the
privilege
of
staying
in
the
kitchen
awhile
aunt
jane
was
one
of
those
rare
housekeepers
whose
kitchens
are
more
attractive
than
the
parlors
of
other
people
and
gittin
religion
is
different
too
she
continued
propping
her
feet
on
the
round
of
a
chair
for
the
greater
comfort
and
convenience
of
her
old
knees
both
of
is
a
heap
easier
than
they
used
to
be
and
the
organs
is
a
heap
better
i
do
know
whether
the
any
better
or
not
you
know
i
went
up
to
my
daughter
mary
last
week
and
the
folks
up
there
was
havin
a
big
meetin
in
the
tabernicle
and
that
how
come
me
to
be
thinkin
about
organs
the
preacher
was
an
evangelist
as
they
call
him
sam
joynes
from
down
south
in
my
day
he
been
called
the
rev
samuel
joynes
folks
did
call
their
preachers
tom
dick
and
harry
and
jim
and
sam
like
they
do
now
i
like
to
seen
anybody
parson
page
page
he
was
the
rev
lemuel
page
and
do
you
forgit
it
but
things
is
different
as
i
said
awhile
ago
and
even
the
little
boys
says
joynes
jest
like
he
played
marbles
with
every
day
i
went
to
the
tabernicle
three
or
four
times
and
of
all
the
preachers
that
ever
i
heard
he
certainly
is
the
beatenest
why
i
ai
laughed
so
much
since
me
and
abram
went
to
barnum
circus
the
year
before
the
war
he
was
preachin
one
day
about
cleanliness
bein
next
to
godliness
which
it
certainly
is
and
he
says
old
skunk
you
but
la
the
worse
names
he
called
the
better
they
to
like
it
and
sinners
was
converted
wholesale
every
time
he
preached
but
there
was
no
goin
to
the
mourners
bench
and
mournin
for
your
sins
and
havin
people
prayin
and
cryin
over
you
they
jest
set
and
laughed
and
grinned
while
he
was
gittin
off
his
jokes
and
then
they
go
up
and
shake
hands
with
him
and
there
they
was
all
saved
and
ready
to
be
baptized
and
taken
into
the
church
just
here
the
old
yellow
rooster
fluttered
up
to
the
and
gave
a
hoarse
ominous
crow
there
now
you
hear
that
said
aunt
jane
as
she
tossed
him
a
golden
peeling
from
her
pan
there
some
folks
that
gives
right
up
and
looks
for
sickness
or
death
or
bad
news
every
time
a
rooster
crows
in
the
door
but
i
never
let
such
things
bother
me
the
bible
says
that
nobody
knows
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
and
if
i
do
know
it
ai
likely
my
old
yeller
rooster
does
what
was
i
talkin
about
oh
yes
the
big
meetin
well
i
never
was
any
hand
to
say
that
old
ways
is
best
and
i
do
say
so
now
if
you
can
convert
a
man
by
callin
him
a
polecat
why
call
him
one
of
course
and
mournin
ai
always
a
sign
o
true
repentance
they
used
to
tell
how
silas
petty
mourned
for
forty
days
and
as
sally
ann
said
he
had
about
as
much
religion
as
old
dan
tucker
derby
ram
however
it
was
the
organ
i
set
out
to
tell
about
it
jest
like
me
to
wander
away
from
the
abram
always
said
a
text
would
have
to
be
made
like
a
postage
stamp
for
me
to
stick
to
it
you
see
jest
got
a
fine
new
organ
at
mary
frances
church
and
she
was
me
how
they
paid
for
it
one
man
give
five
hundred
dollars
and
another
give
three
hundred
then
they
collected
four
or
five
hundred
amongst
the
other
members
and
give
a
lawn
party
and
a
strawberry
festival
and
raised
another
hundred
it
set
me
to
thinkin
o
the
time
us
women
got
the
organ
for
goshen
church
it
was
any
light
matter
for
besides
the
money
it
took
us
nearly
three
years
to
raise
there
was
the
opposition
come
to
think
of
it
we
raised
more
opposition
than
we
did
money
and
aunt
jane
laughed
a
blithe
laugh
and
tossed
another
peeling
to
the
yellow
rooster
who
had
dropped
the
rôle
of
harbinger
of
evil
and
was
posing
as
a
humble
suppliant
an
organ
in
them
days
honey
was
jest
a
wedge
to
split
the
church
half
in
two
it
was
the
new
cyarpet
that
brought
on
the
organ
you
know
how
it
is
with
yourself
you
git
a
new
dress
and
then
you
got
to
have
a
new
bonnet
and
then
you
ca
wear
your
old
shoes
and
gloves
with
a
new
dress
and
a
new
bonnet
and
the
first
thing
you
know
you
spent
five
times
as
much
as
you
set
out
to
spend
that
the
way
it
was
with
us
about
the
cyarpet
and
the
organ
and
the
pulpit
chairs
and
the
communion
set
most
o
the
men
folks
was
against
the
organ
from
the
start
and
silas
petty
was
the
foremost
silas
made
a
of
goin
against
everything
that
women
favored
sally
ann
used
to
say
that
if
a
woman
was
to
come
up
to
him
and
say
go
to
heaven
silas
would
start
off
towards
the
other
place
right
at
once
he
was
jest
that
mulish
and
contrairy
he
met
sally
ann
one
day
and
says
he
give
you
women
rope
enough
and
you
turn
the
house
o
the
lord
into
a
and
sally
ann
she
says
better
go
home
silas
and
read
the
book
of
exodus
if
the
lord
told
moses
how
to
build
the
tabernicle
with
the
goats
skins
and
rams
skins
and
blue
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
fine
linen
and
candlesticks
with
six
branches
i
reckon
he
object
to
a
few
yards
o
cyarpetin
and
a
little
organ
in
goshen
church
sally
ann
always
had
an
answer
ready
and
i
used
to
think
she
knew
more
about
the
bible
than
parson
page
did
himself
of
course
uncle
jim
matthews
did
want
the
organ
he
was
afraid
it
might
interfere
with
his
singin
job
taylor
always
stood
up
for
silas
so
he
did
want
it
and
parson
page
never
opened
his
mouth
one
way
or
the
other
he
was
one
o
those
men
that
tries
to
set
on
both
sides
o
the
fence
at
once
and
he
set
that
way
so
long
he
was
a
mighty
good
hand
at
balancin
himself
us
women
did
say
much
but
we
made
up
our
minds
to
have
the
organ
so
we
went
to
work
in
the
mite
society
and
in
three
years
we
had
enough
money
to
git
it
i
often
wondered
how
many
pounds
butter
and
how
many
baskets
of
eggs
it
took
to
raise
that
money
i
reckon
if
they
been
piled
up
on
top
of
each
other
they
reached
to
the
top
o
the
steeple
the
women
of
israel
brought
their
and
bracelets
to
help
build
the
tabernicle
but
we
had
jest
our
egg
and
butter
money
and
the
second
year
when
the
chicken
cholery
was
so
bad
our
prospects
looked
mighty
blue
when
i
saw
that
big
organ
up
at
danville
i
could
help
about
the
little
thing
we
worked
so
hard
to
git
was
much
a
washstand
and
i
reckon
if
i
was
to
hear
it
now
i
think
it
was
mighty
feeble
and
squeaky
but
it
sounded
fine
enough
to
us
in
them
days
and
little
as
it
was
it
raised
a
disturbance
for
miles
around
when
it
come
down
from
louisville
abram
went
to
town
with
his
wagon
and
brought
it
out
and
set
it
up
in
our
parlor
my
jane
had
been
takin
lessons
in
town
all
winter
so
to
be
able
to
play
on
it
we
had
a
right
good
choir
for
them
days
the
only
trouble
was
that
everybody
wanted
to
be
leader
that
a
common
failin
with
church
choirs
i
noticed
milly
amos
sung
soprano
and
my
jane
was
the
alto
john
petty
sung
bass
and
young
sam
crawford
tenor
and
as
for
uncle
jim
matthews
he
sung
everything
and
a
plenty
of
it
too
milly
amos
used
to
say
he
was
a
flea
he
start
out
on
the
bass
and
first
thing
you
knew
he
be
singin
tenor
with
sam
crawford
and
by
the
time
sam
was
good
and
mad
he
be
off
onto
the
alto
or
the
soprano
he
was
one
o
these
meddlesome
old
creeturs
that
thinks
the
world
never
moved
till
they
got
into
it
and
they
got
to
help
everybody
out
with
whatever
they
happen
to
be
doin
you
heard
children
bein
born
kickin
well
uncle
jim
must
been
born
singin
i
seen
people
that
said
they
did
like
the
idea
o
to
heaven
and
standin
around
a
throne
and
singin
hymns
for
ever
and
ever
but
you
could
pleased
uncle
jim
better
than
to
set
him
down
in
jest
that
sort
o
heaven
wherever
there
was
a
chance
to
get
in
some
singin
there
you
be
sure
to
find
uncle
jim
folks
used
to
say
he
enjoyed
a
funeral
a
heap
better
than
he
did
a
weddin
he
could
sing
at
the
funeral
and
he
could
at
the
weddin
and
sam
crawford
said
he
believed
if
gabriel
was
to
come
down
and
blow
his
trumpet
uncle
jim
would
git
up
and
begin
to
sing
it
would
been
so
bad
if
he
had
any
sort
of
a
voice
but
been
singin
all
his
life
and
hollerin
at
protracted
meetin
ever
since
he
got
religion
till
he
sung
and
hollered
all
the
music
out
of
his
voice
and
there
was
much
left
but
the
old
creaky
machinery
it
used
to
make
me
think
of
an
old
rickety
house
with
the
blinds
flappin
in
the
wind
it
mortified
us
terrible
to
have
any
of
the
methodists
or
babtists
come
to
our
church
we
was
sort
o
used
to
the
old
man
capers
but
people
that
was
could
keep
a
straight
face
when
the
singin
begun
and
it
took
more
grace
than
any
of
us
had
to
keep
from
gittin
mad
when
we
seen
people
from
another
church
at
our
choir
the
babtists
had
a
powerful
protracted
meetin
one
winter
uncle
jim
was
there
to
help
with
the
singin
as
a
matter
of
course
and
he
begun
to
git
mightily
interested
in
babtist
doctrines
used
to
go
home
with
after
church
and
talk
about
greek
and
hebrew
words
till
the
clock
struck
twelve
and
one
communion
sunday
he
got
up
solemn
as
a
owl
and
marched
out
o
church
jest
before
the
bread
and
wine
was
passed
made
out
like
he
war
sure
he
been
rightly
babtized
the
choir
was
mightily
tickled
at
the
idea
o
gittin
shed
o
the
old
pest
and
sam
crawford
went
to
him
and
told
him
he
was
on
the
right
track
and
to
go
ahead
for
the
babtists
was
undoubtedly
correct
and
if
it
was
for
displeasin
his
father
and
mother
he
jine
himself
and
then
sam
never
could
let
well
enough
alone
then
he
went
to
bush
elrod
the
babtist
tenor
and
says
he
hear
you
to
have
a
new
member
in
your
choir
and
bush
says
if
the
old
idiot
ever
jines
this
church
we
hold
his
head
under
the
water
so
long
that
he
wo
be
able
to
spile
good
music
agin
and
then
he
give
uncle
jim
a
hint
o
how
things
was
and
when
uncle
jim
heard
that
the
presbyterians
was
anxious
to
git
shed
of
him
he
found
out
right
away
that
all
them
greek
and
hebrew
words
meant
sprinklin
and
infant
babtism
so
he
settled
down
to
stay
where
he
was
and
hollered
ever
the
next
sunday
the
old
man
was
a
good
enough
christian
i
reckon
but
when
it
come
to
singin
he
was
a
and
rock
of
offense
to
the
whole
church
and
especially
to
the
choir
the
first
thing
sally
ann
said
when
she
looked
at
the
new
organ
was
jane
how
do
you
reckon
it
goin
to
sound
with
uncle
jim
voice
and
i
laughed
till
i
had
to
set
down
in
a
cheer
well
when
the
men
folks
found
out
that
our
organ
had
come
they
begun
to
wake
up
abram
had
brought
it
out
tuesday
and
wednesday
night
as
soon
as
broke
parson
page
says
says
he
there
is
a
little
business
to
be
transacted
please
remain
a
few
minutes
longer
and
then
when
we
had
set
down
again
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
sisters
had
raised
money
and
bought
an
organ
and
there
was
some
division
of
opinion
among
the
brethren
about
usin
it
so
he
would
like
to
have
the
matter
discussed
he
used
a
lot
o
big
words
and
talked
mighty
smooth
and
i
knew
there
was
trouble
ahead
for
us
women
uncle
jim
was
the
first
one
to
speak
he
was
so
anxious
to
begin
he
could
hardly
wait
for
parson
page
to
stop
and
anybody
would
thought
that
he
been
up
to
heaven
and
talked
with
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
and
all
the
angels
to
hear
him
tell
about
the
sort
o
music
there
was
in
heaven
and
the
sort
there
ought
to
be
on
earth
brethren
says
he
john
saw
the
heavens
opened
there
was
no
organs
up
there
god
do
keer
nothin
says
he
such
worldly
instruments
but
when
a
lot
o
sweet
human
voices
git
to
praisin
him
why
the
very
angels
stop
singin
to
listen
milly
amos
was
right
behind
me
and
she
leaned
over
and
says
if
the
angels
rather
hear
uncle
jim
singin
than
our
organ
they
got
mighty
pore
taste
that
all
i
got
to
say
silas
petty
was
the
next
one
to
git
up
and
says
he
never
was
in
favor
o
doin
things
brethren
and
if
we
got
to
have
the
organ
why
we
might
as
well
have
a
monkey
too
and
be
done
with
it
for
my
part
says
he
want
to
worship
in
the
good
old
way
my
fathers
and
grandfathers
worshiped
in
and
unless
my
feelin
change
very
considerable
i
shall
have
to
withdraw
from
this
church
if
any
such
satan
is
set
up
in
this
holy
place
and
sally
ann
turned
around
and
whispered
to
me
ought
to
got
that
organ
long
ago
jane
i
like
to
laughed
right
out
and
i
leaned
over
and
says
i
do
you
git
up
and
talk
for
us
sally
ann
and
she
says
spirit
ai
moved
me
jane
i
reckon
too
busy
movin
uncle
jim
and
silas
petty
jest
then
i
looked
around
and
there
was
abram
standin
up
well
you
could
knocked
me
over
with
a
feather
abram
always
was
one
those
men
never
spoke
if
he
could
git
around
it
any
way
whatever
parson
page
used
to
git
after
him
every
protracted
about
not
leadin
in
prayer
and
havin
family
worship
but
the
spirit
moved
him
that
time
sure
and
there
he
was
talkin
as
glib
as
old
uncle
jim
and
says
he
i
not
carin
much
one
way
or
another
about
this
organ
i
do
know
how
the
angels
feel
about
it
not
havin
so
much
acquaintance
with
as
uncle
jim
has
but
i
do
know
enough
about
women
to
know
that
there
ai
any
use
tryin
to
stop
when
they
git
their
heads
set
on
a
thing
and
i
goin
to
haul
that
organ
over
mornin
and
set
it
up
for
the
choir
to
practise
by
friday
night
if
i
do
haul
it
over
sally
ann
and
jane
tote
it
over
between
and
if
they
ca
put
it
into
the
church
by
the
door
they
hist
a
window
and
put
it
in
that
way
i
reckon
says
he
got
all
the
men
against
me
in
this
matter
but
then
i
got
all
the
women
on
my
side
and
i
reckon
all
the
women
and
one
man
makes
a
pretty
good
majority
and
so
i
goin
to
haul
the
organ
over
mornin
i
declare
i
felt
real
proud
of
abram
and
i
told
him
so
that
night
when
we
was
goin
home
together
then
parson
page
he
says
seems
to
me
there
is
sound
sense
in
what
brother
parish
says
and
i
suggest
that
we
allow
the
sisters
to
have
their
way
and
give
the
organ
a
trial
and
if
we
find
that
it
is
hurtful
to
the
interests
of
the
church
it
will
be
an
easy
matter
to
remove
it
and
milly
amos
says
to
me
see
gittin
that
organ
out
if
we
once
git
it
in
when
the
choir
met
friday
night
milly
come
in
all
in
a
flurry
and
says
she
hear
brother
gardner
has
gone
to
the
down
in
russellville
and
all
the
babtists
are
comin
to
our
church
sunday
and
i
want
to
show
what
good
music
is
this
once
anyhow
uncle
jim
matthews
is
laid
up
with
rheumatism
says
she
if
that
ai
a
special
providence
i
never
saw
one
and
sam
crawford
slapped
his
knee
and
says
he
if
the
old
man
rheumatism
jest
holds
out
over
sunday
them
babtists
hear
music
sure
then
milly
went
on
to
tell
that
she
been
up
to
squire
elrod
and
miss
penelope
the
squire
niece
from
louisville
had
promised
to
sing
a
voluntary
sunday
what
that
says
sam
says
milly
a
hymn
that
the
choir
or
somebody
in
it
sings
of
their
own
accord
without
the
preacher
givin
it
out
just
like
your
tomatoes
come
up
in
the
spring
voluntary
without
you
plantin
the
seed
that
the
way
they
do
in
the
city
churches
says
she
we
are
goin
to
put
on
city
style
sunday
then
they
went
to
work
and
practised
some
new
tunes
for
the
hymns
parson
page
had
give
so
if
uncle
jim
rheumatism
did
hold
out
he
still
have
to
hold
his
peace
well
sunday
come
but
special
providence
was
on
uncle
jim
side
that
time
and
there
he
was
as
smilin
as
a
basket
o
chips
if
he
did
have
to
walk
with
a
cane
we
had
the
church
cleaned
up
as
neat
as
a
new
pin
my
jane
had
put
a
bunch
of
honeysuckles
and
pinks
on
the
organ
and
everybody
was
dressed
in
their
best
miss
penelope
was
settin
at
the
organ
with
a
bunch
of
roses
in
her
hand
and
the
windows
was
all
open
and
you
could
see
the
trees
wavin
in
the
wind
and
hear
the
birds
singin
outside
i
always
did
think
that
was
the
best
part
o
sunday
that
time
jest
before
church
begins
aunt
jane
voice
dropped
her
words
came
slowly
and
into
the
story
fell
one
of
those
flashes
of
silence
to
which
she
was
as
little
given
as
the
great
historian
the
pan
of
dumplings
waited
for
the
sprinkling
of
spice
and
sugar
while
she
stood
motionless
looking
afar
off
though
her
gaze
apparently
stopped
on
the
vacant
whitewashed
wall
before
her
no
mind
reader
art
was
needed
to
tell
what
scene
her
faded
eyes
beheld
there
was
the
old
church
with
its
battered
furniture
and
high
pulpit
for
one
brief
moment
the
grave
had
yielded
up
its
dead
and
the
old
familiar
faces
looked
out
from
every
pew
we
were
very
near
together
aunt
jane
and
i
but
the
breeze
that
fanned
her
brow
was
not
the
breeze
i
felt
as
i
sat
by
her
kitchen
window
for
her
a
wind
was
blowing
across
the
plains
of
memory
and
the
honeysuckle
odor
it
carried
was
not
from
the
bush
in
the
yard
it
came
weighted
with
dreams
from
the
blossoms
that
her
jane
had
placed
on
the
organ
years
ago
a
was
calling
in
the
meadow
across
the
dusty
road
and
the
echoes
of
the
second
bell
had
just
died
away
she
and
abram
were
side
by
side
in
their
accustomed
place
and
life
lay
like
a
watered
garden
in
the
peaceful
stillness
of
the
time
jest
before
church
begins
the
asparagus
on
the
stove
boiled
over
with
a
great
spluttering
and
aunt
jane
came
back
to
the
eternal
now
sakes
alive
she
exclaimed
as
she
lifted
the
saucepan
i
must
be
gittin
old
to
let
things
boil
over
this
way
while
i
studyin
about
old
times
i
declare
i
believe
i
clean
forgot
what
i
was
sayin
you
were
at
church
i
suggested
and
the
singing
was
about
to
begin
sure
enough
well
all
at
once
miss
penelope
laid
her
hands
on
the
keys
and
begun
to
play
and
sing
my
god
to
thee
we
heard
that
hymn
all
our
lives
at
church
and
protracted
meetin
and
but
we
did
know
how
it
could
sound
till
miss
penelope
sung
it
all
by
herself
that
day
with
our
new
organ
i
ricollect
jest
how
she
looked
pretty
little
thing
that
she
was
and
sometimes
i
can
hear
her
voice
jest
as
plain
as
i
hear
that
robin
out
yonder
in
the
ellum
tree
every
word
was
jest
like
a
bright
new
piece
o
silver
and
every
note
was
jest
like
gold
and
she
was
lookin
up
through
the
winder
at
the
trees
and
the
sky
like
she
was
singin
to
somebody
we
could
see
we
clean
forgot
about
the
new
organ
and
the
baptists
and
i
really
believe
we
was
feelin
nearer
to
god
than
ever
felt
before
when
she
got
through
with
the
first
verse
she
played
somethin
soft
and
sweet
and
begun
again
and
right
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
i
declare
it
years
ago
but
i
git
mad
now
when
i
think
about
it
right
in
the
middle
of
the
first
line
uncle
jim
jined
in
like
an
old
squawkin
and
sung
like
he
was
tryin
to
drown
out
miss
penelope
and
the
new
organ
too
everybody
give
a
jump
when
he
first
started
and
he
got
nearly
through
the
verse
before
we
took
in
what
was
happenin
even
the
babtists
jest
looked
surprised
like
the
rest
of
us
but
when
miss
penelope
begun
the
third
time
and
uncle
jim
jined
in
with
his
hollerin
i
saw
bush
elrod
grin
and
that
grin
spread
all
over
the
babtist
crowd
in
no
time
the
presbyterian
young
folks
was
behind
their
fans
and
bush
got
to
laughin
till
he
had
to
git
up
and
leave
the
church
they
said
he
went
up
the
road
to
sam
amos
pasture
and
laid
down
on
the
ground
and
rolled
over
and
over
and
laughed
till
he
could
laugh
any
more
i
was
so
mad
i
started
to
git
up
though
goodness
knows
what
i
could
done
abram
he
grabbed
my
dress
and
says
jane
jest
like
he
was
talkin
to
the
old
mare
the
thing
that
made
me
maddest
was
silas
petty
back
in
his
pew
and
smilin
as
satisfied
as
if
he
seen
the
salvation
of
the
lord
i
did
mind
the
babtists
half
as
much
as
i
did
silas
the
only
person
in
the
church
that
was
the
least
bit
flustered
was
miss
penelope
she
was
a
marshall
on
her
mother
side
and
i
always
said
that
nobody
but
a
born
lady
could
acted
as
she
did
she
sung
right
on
as
if
everything
was
goin
exactly
right
and
she
been
singin
hymns
with
uncle
jim
all
her
life
two
or
three
times
when
the
old
man
kind
o
lagged
behind
it
looked
like
she
waited
for
him
to
ketch
up
and
when
she
got
through
and
uncle
jim
was
lumberin
on
the
last
note
she
folded
her
hands
and
set
there
lookin
out
the
winder
where
the
sun
was
shinin
on
the
silver
poplar
trees
jest
as
peaceful
as
a
angel
and
the
rest
of
us
as
mad
as
hornets
milly
amos
set
back
of
uncle
jim
and
his
red
bandanna
handkerchief
was
lyin
over
his
shoulders
where
he
been
shooin
the
flies
away
she
told
me
the
next
day
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
from
reachin
over
and
chokin
the
old
man
off
while
miss
penelope
was
singin
i
said
miss
penelope
was
the
only
one
that
was
flustered
i
ought
to
said
miss
penelope
and
uncle
jim
the
old
creetur
was
jest
that
he
did
know
he
done
anything
out
o
the
way
and
he
set
there
lookin
as
pleased
as
a
child
and
thinkin
i
reckon
how
smart
he
been
to
help
miss
penelope
out
with
the
singin
the
rest
o
the
hymns
went
off
all
right
and
it
did
me
good
to
see
uncle
jim
face
when
they
struck
up
the
new
tunes
he
tried
to
jine
in
but
he
had
to
give
it
up
and
wait
for
the
doxology
parson
page
preached
a
powerful
good
sermon
but
i
do
reckon
it
did
some
of
us
much
good
we
was
so
put
out
about
uncle
jim
our
voluntary
after
meetin
broke
and
we
was
goin
home
me
and
abram
had
to
pass
by
silas
petty
wagon
he
was
helpin
maria
in
and
i
do
know
what
she
been
sayin
but
he
says
a
righteous
judgment
on
you
women
maria
for
profanin
the
lord
house
with
that
there
organ
and
mad
as
i
was
i
had
to
laugh
when
i
thought
of
old
uncle
jim
matthews
executin
a
judgment
of
the
lord
uncle
jim
never
made
a
livin
at
the
carpenter
trade
and
i
reckon
if
the
lord
had
wanted
anybody
to
help
him
execute
a
judgment
uncle
jim
would
been
the
last
man
he
thought
of
of
course
the
choir
was
ever
at
uncle
jim
and
when
milly
amos
had
fever
that
summer
she
called
sam
to
her
the
day
she
was
at
her
worst
and
pulled
his
head
down
and
whispered
as
feeble
as
a
baby
let
uncle
jim
sing
at
my
funeral
sam
i
rise
up
out
of
my
coffin
if
he
does
and
sam
broke
out
and
at
the
same
time
he
thought
a
heap
o
milly
and
says
he
milly
if
it
have
that
effect
uncle
jim
shall
sing
at
the
funeral
sure
and
milly
got
to
laughin
weak
as
she
was
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
when
she
woke
up
the
fever
was
gone
and
she
begun
to
git
well
from
that
day
i
always
believed
that
laugh
was
the
instead
of
uncle
jim
singin
at
her
funeral
she
sung
at
uncle
jim
and
broke
down
and
cried
like
a
child
for
all
the
mean
things
she
said
about
the
pore
old
creetur
voice
the
asparagus
had
been
transferred
to
a
china
dish
and
the
browned
butter
was
ready
to
pour
over
it
the
potatoes
were
steaming
themselves
into
mealy
delicacy
and
aunt
jane
peered
into
the
stove
where
the
dumplings
were
taking
on
a
golden
brown
her
evidently
did
not
interfere
with
her
culinary
skill
and
i
said
so
la
child
she
replied
dashing
a
pinch
of
seasonin
into
the
peas
when
i
git
so
old
i
ca
do
but
one
thing
at
a
time
i
try
to
die
as
soon
as
possible
iii
aunt
jane
album
illustration
they
were
a
bizarre
mass
of
color
on
the
sweet
spring
landscape
those
patchwork
quilts
swaying
in
a
long
line
under
the
elms
and
maples
the
old
orchard
made
a
blossoming
background
for
them
and
farther
off
on
the
horizon
rose
the
beauty
of
fresh
verdure
and
purple
mist
on
those
low
hills
or
knobs
that
are
to
the
heart
of
the
kentuckian
as
the
alps
to
the
swiss
or
the
sea
to
the
sailor
i
opened
the
gate
softly
and
paused
for
a
moment
between
the
blossoming
lilacs
that
grew
on
each
side
of
the
path
the
fragrance
of
the
white
and
the
purple
blooms
was
like
a
over
the
graves
of
many
a
dead
spring
and
as
i
stood
shaken
with
thoughts
as
the
flowers
are
with
the
winds
aunt
jane
came
around
from
the
back
of
the
house
her
black
silk
cape
fluttering
from
her
shoulders
and
a
calico
sunbonnet
hiding
her
features
in
its
cavernous
depth
she
walked
briskly
to
the
and
began
patting
and
smoothing
the
quilts
where
the
breeze
had
disarranged
them
aunt
jane
i
called
out
are
you
having
a
fair
all
by
yourself
she
turned
quickly
pushing
back
the
sunbonnet
from
her
eyes
why
child
she
said
with
a
happy
laugh
you
come
pretty
nigh
skeerin
me
no
i
ai
havin
any
fair
i
jest
givin
my
quilts
their
spring
airin
twice
a
year
i
put
out
in
the
sun
and
wind
and
this
mornin
the
air
smelt
so
sweet
i
thought
it
was
a
good
chance
to
freshen
up
for
the
summer
it
about
time
to
take
in
now
she
began
to
fold
the
quilts
and
lay
them
over
her
arm
and
i
did
the
same
back
and
forth
we
went
from
the
to
the
house
and
from
the
house
to
the
until
the
quilts
were
safely
housed
from
the
coming
dewfall
and
piled
on
every
available
chair
in
the
front
room
i
looked
at
them
in
sheer
amazement
there
seemed
to
be
every
pattern
that
the
ingenuity
of
woman
could
devise
and
the
industry
of
woman
put
together
chases
rising
suns
hexagons
diamonds
and
only
aunt
jane
knows
what
else
as
for
color
a
sandwich
islander
would
have
danced
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
those
reds
purples
yellows
and
greens
did
you
really
make
all
these
quilts
aunt
jane
i
asked
wonderingly
aunt
jane
eyes
sparkled
with
pride
every
stitch
of
child
she
said
except
the
quiltin
the
neighbors
used
to
come
in
and
help
some
with
that
i
heard
folks
say
that
piecin
quilts
was
nothin
but
a
waste
o
time
but
that
ai
always
so
they
used
to
say
that
sarah
jane
mitchell
would
set
down
right
after
breakfast
and
piece
till
it
was
time
to
git
dinner
and
then
set
and
piece
till
she
had
to
git
supper
and
then
piece
by
till
she
fell
asleep
in
her
cheer
i
ricollect
goin
over
there
one
day
and
sarah
jane
was
dinner
in
a
big
hurry
for
sam
had
to
go
to
town
with
some
cattle
and
there
was
a
big
basket
o
quilt
pieces
in
the
middle
o
the
kitchen
floor
and
the
house
lookin
like
a
pigpen
and
the
children
runnin
around
half
naked
and
sam
he
laughed
and
says
he
jane
if
we
could
wear
quilts
and
eat
quilts
we
be
the
richest
people
in
the
country
sam
was
the
man
that
ever
was
or
he
could
put
up
with
sarah
jane
shiftless
ways
hannah
crawford
said
she
sent
sarah
jane
a
bundle
o
caliker
once
by
sam
and
sam
always
declared
he
lost
it
but
uncle
jim
matthews
said
he
was
ridin
along
the
road
jest
behind
sam
and
he
saw
sam
throw
it
into
the
creek
jest
as
he
got
on
the
bridge
i
never
blamed
sam
a
bit
if
he
did
but
there
never
was
any
time
wasted
on
my
quilts
child
i
can
look
at
every
one
of
with
a
clear
conscience
i
did
my
work
faithful
and
then
when
i
might
set
and
held
my
hands
i
make
a
block
or
two
o
patchwork
and
before
long
i
have
enough
to
put
together
in
a
quilt
i
went
to
piecin
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
to
hold
a
needle
and
a
piece
o
cloth
and
one
o
the
first
things
i
can
remember
was
settin
on
the
back
sewin
my
quilt
pieces
and
mother
praisin
my
stitches
nowadays
folks
do
have
to
sew
unless
they
want
to
but
when
i
was
a
child
there
war
any
and
it
was
about
as
needful
for
folks
to
know
how
to
sew
as
it
was
for
to
know
how
to
eat
and
every
child
that
was
well
raised
could
hem
and
run
and
backstitch
and
gether
and
overhand
by
the
time
she
was
nine
years
old
why
i
pieced
four
quilts
by
the
time
i
was
nineteen
years
old
and
when
me
and
abram
set
up
housekeepin
i
had
bedclothes
enough
for
three
beds
i
had
a
heap
o
comfort
all
my
life
makin
quilts
and
now
in
my
old
age
i
would
take
a
fortune
for
set
down
here
child
where
you
can
see
out
o
the
winder
and
smell
the
lilacs
and
we
look
at
all
you
see
some
folks
has
albums
to
put
folks
pictures
in
to
remember
by
and
some
folks
has
a
book
and
writes
down
the
things
that
happen
every
day
so
they
wo
forgit
but
honey
these
quilts
is
my
albums
and
my
and
whenever
the
weather
bad
and
i
ca
git
out
to
see
folks
i
jest
spread
out
my
quilts
and
look
at
and
study
over
and
it
jest
like
goin
back
fifty
or
sixty
years
and
livin
my
life
over
agin
there
ai
nothin
like
a
piece
o
caliker
for
bringin
back
old
times
child
unless
it
a
flower
or
a
bunch
o
thyme
or
a
piece
anything
that
smells
sweet
why
i
can
go
out
yonder
in
the
yard
and
gether
a
bunch
o
that
purple
lilac
and
jest
shut
my
eyes
and
see
faces
i
ai
seen
for
fifty
years
and
somethin
goes
through
me
like
a
flash
o
lightnin
and
it
seems
like
i
young
agin
jest
for
that
minute
aunt
jane
hands
were
stroking
lovingly
a
that
resembled
the
coat
of
many
colors
now
this
quilt
honey
she
said
i
made
out
o
the
pieces
o
my
children
clothes
their
little
dresses
and
waists
and
aprons
some
of
dead
and
some
of
grown
and
married
and
a
long
way
off
from
me
further
off
than
the
ones
that
dead
i
sometimes
think
but
when
i
set
down
and
look
at
this
quilt
and
think
over
the
pieces
it
seems
like
they
all
come
back
and
i
can
see
playin
around
the
floors
and
goin
in
and
out
and
hear
cryin
and
laughin
and
callin
me
jest
like
they
used
to
do
before
they
grew
up
to
men
and
women
and
before
there
was
any
little
graves
o
mine
out
in
the
old
over
yonder
wonderful
imagination
of
motherhood
that
can
bring
childhood
back
from
the
dust
of
the
grave
and
banish
the
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
of
age
with
no
other
talisman
than
a
scrap
of
faded
calico
the
old
woman
hands
were
moving
tremulously
over
the
surface
of
the
quilt
as
if
they
touched
the
golden
curls
of
the
little
dream
children
who
had
vanished
from
her
hearth
so
many
years
ago
but
there
were
no
tears
either
in
her
eyes
or
in
her
voice
i
had
long
noticed
that
aunt
jane
always
smiled
when
she
spoke
of
the
people
whom
the
world
calls
dead
or
the
things
it
calls
lost
or
past
these
words
seemed
to
have
for
her
higher
and
tenderer
meanings
than
are
placed
on
them
by
the
sorrowful
heart
of
humanity
but
the
moments
were
passing
and
one
could
not
dwell
too
long
on
any
quilt
however
well
beloved
aunt
jane
rose
briskly
folded
up
the
one
that
lay
across
her
knees
and
whisked
out
another
from
the
huge
pile
in
an
old
chair
here
a
piece
o
one
o
sally
ann
purple
caliker
dresses
sally
ann
always
thought
a
heap
o
purple
caliker
here
one
o
milly
ginghams
that
one
and
that
piece
o
white
with
the
rosebuds
in
it
that
miss
penelope
she
give
it
to
me
the
summer
before
she
died
bless
her
soul
that
dress
jest
matched
her
face
exactly
somehow
her
and
her
clothes
always
looked
alike
and
her
voice
matched
her
face
too
one
o
the
things
i
lookin
forward
to
child
is
seein
miss
penelope
agin
and
hearin
her
sing
voices
and
faces
is
alike
there
some
that
you
ca
remember
and
some
you
ca
forgit
i
seen
a
heap
o
people
and
heard
a
heap
voices
but
miss
penelope
face
was
different
from
all
the
rest
and
so
was
her
voice
why
if
she
said
mornin
to
you
you
hear
that
mornin
all
day
and
her
singin
i
know
there
never
was
anything
like
it
in
this
world
my
grandchildren
all
laugh
at
me
for
thinkin
so
much
o
miss
penelope
singin
but
then
they
never
heard
her
and
i
have
that
the
difference
my
grandchild
henrietta
was
down
here
three
or
four
years
ago
and
says
she
do
you
want
to
go
up
to
louisville
with
me
and
hear
patti
sing
and
says
i
who
child
says
i
it
was
to
hear
miss
penelope
sing
carry
these
old
bones
o
mine
clear
from
here
to
new
york
but
there
ai
anybody
else
i
want
to
hear
sing
bad
enough
to
go
up
to
louisville
or
anywhere
else
and
some
o
these
days
says
i
goin
to
hear
miss
penelope
aunt
jane
laughed
blithely
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
laugh
with
her
honey
she
said
in
the
next
breath
lowering
her
voice
and
laying
her
finger
on
the
rosebud
piece
honey
there
one
thing
i
ca
git
over
here
a
piece
o
miss
penelope
dress
but
miss
ai
it
strange
that
a
piece
o
caliker
outlast
you
and
me
do
it
look
like
folks
ought
hold
on
to
their
bodies
as
long
as
other
folks
holds
on
to
a
piece
o
the
dresses
they
used
to
wear
questions
as
old
as
the
human
heart
and
its
human
grief
here
is
the
glove
but
where
is
the
hand
it
held
but
yesterday
here
the
jewel
that
she
wore
but
where
is
she
where
is
the
pompadour
now
was
the
pompadour
fan
strange
that
such
things
as
gloves
jewels
fans
and
dresses
can
outlast
a
woman
form
behold
i
show
you
a
mystery
the
mystery
of
mortality
and
an
eery
feeling
came
over
me
as
i
entered
into
the
old
woman
mood
and
thought
of
the
strong
vital
bodies
that
had
clothed
themselves
in
those
fabrics
of
purple
and
pink
and
white
and
that
now
were
dust
and
ashes
lying
in
sad
neglected
graves
on
farm
and
lonely
roadside
there
lay
the
quilt
on
our
knees
and
the
gay
scraps
of
calico
seemed
to
mock
us
with
their
vivid
colors
aunt
jane
cheerful
voice
called
me
back
from
the
tombs
here
a
piece
o
one
o
my
dresses
she
said
brown
ground
with
a
red
ring
in
it
abram
picked
it
out
and
here
another
one
that
light
yeller
ground
with
the
vine
runnin
through
it
i
never
had
so
many
caliker
dresses
that
i
did
want
one
more
for
in
my
day
folks
used
to
think
a
caliker
dress
was
good
enough
to
wear
anywhere
abram
knew
my
failin
and
two
or
three
times
a
year
he
bring
me
a
dress
when
he
come
from
town
and
the
dresses
he
pick
out
always
suited
me
the
ones
i
picked
i
ricollect
i
finished
this
quilt
the
summer
before
mary
frances
was
born
and
sally
ann
and
milly
amos
and
maria
petty
come
over
and
give
me
a
lift
on
the
quiltin
here
milly
work
here
sally
ann
and
here
maria
i
looked
but
my
inexperienced
eye
could
see
no
difference
in
the
handiwork
of
the
three
women
aunt
jane
saw
my
look
of
incredulity
now
child
she
said
earnestly
you
think
i
foolin
you
but
la
there
jest
as
much
difference
in
folks
sewin
as
there
is
in
their
handwritin
milly
made
a
fine
stitch
but
she
could
keep
on
the
line
to
save
her
life
maria
never
could
make
a
stitch
some
be
long
and
some
short
and
sally
ann
was
but
all
of
coarse
i
can
see
now
stoopin
over
the
quiltin
frames
milly
talkin
as
hard
as
she
sewed
sally
ann
throwin
in
a
word
now
and
then
and
maria
never
openin
her
mouth
except
to
ask
for
the
thread
or
the
chalk
i
ricollect
they
come
over
after
dinner
and
we
got
the
quilt
out
o
the
frames
long
before
sundown
and
the
next
day
i
begun
bindin
it
and
i
got
the
premium
on
it
that
year
at
the
fair
i
hardly
ever
showed
a
quilt
at
the
fair
that
i
did
take
the
premium
but
here
one
quilt
that
sarah
jane
mitchell
beat
me
on
and
aunt
jane
dragged
out
a
ponderous
affair
the
very
antithesis
of
the
silken
comfortable
that
rests
so
lightly
on
the
couch
of
the
modern
dame
it
makes
me
laugh
jest
to
think
o
that
time
and
how
happy
sarah
jane
was
it
was
way
back
yonder
in
the
fifties
i
ricollect
we
had
a
mighty
fine
fair
that
year
the
crops
was
all
fine
that
season
and
such
apples
and
pears
and
grapes
you
never
did
see
the
floral
hall
was
full
o
things
and
the
whole
county
turned
out
to
go
to
the
fair
abram
and
me
got
there
the
first
day
bright
and
early
and
we
was
walkin
around
the
and
lookin
at
the
townfolks
and
the
sights
and
we
met
sally
ann
she
stopped
us
and
says
she
jane
mitchell
got
a
quilt
in
the
floral
hall
in
competition
with
yours
and
milly
amos
says
i
that
all
the
competition
there
is
and
sally
ann
says
that
amounts
to
anything
there
one
more
but
it
about
as
bad
a
piece
o
sewin
as
sarah
jane
and
that
looks
like
it
hardly
hold
together
till
the
fair
over
and
says
she
do
believe
there
be
any
more
it
looks
like
this
was
an
off
year
on
that
particular
kind
o
quilt
i
did
get
mine
done
says
she
neither
did
maria
petty
and
maybe
it
a
good
thing
after
all
well
i
saw
in
a
minute
what
sally
ann
was
aimin
at
and
i
says
to
abram
have
you
got
somethin
to
do
with
the
judges
for
the
women
things
and
he
says
and
i
says
you
see
to
it
that
sally
ann
gits
to
help
judge
the
caliker
quilts
and
bless
your
soul
abram
got
me
and
sally
ann
both
the
other
judge
was
mis
doctor
brigham
one
o
the
town
ladies
we
told
her
all
about
what
we
wanted
to
do
and
she
jest
laughed
and
says
if
that
ai
the
kindest
nicest
thing
of
course
we
do
it
seein
that
i
had
a
quilt
there
i
had
a
bit
o
business
bein
a
judge
but
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
fold
my
quilt
up
and
hide
it
under
maria
petty
big
worsted
quilt
and
then
we
pinned
the
blue
ribbon
on
sarah
jane
and
the
red
on
milly
i
fixed
it
all
up
with
milly
and
she
was
jest
as
willin
as
i
was
for
sarah
jane
to
have
the
premium
there
was
jest
one
thing
i
was
afraid
of
milly
was
a
woman
but
she
never
had
much
control
over
her
tongue
and
i
says
to
her
says
i
it
mighty
good
of
you
to
give
up
your
chance
for
the
premium
but
if
sarah
jane
ever
finds
it
out
that
spoil
everything
for
says
i
ai
any
kindness
in
doin
a
person
a
favor
and
then
tellin
everybody
about
it
and
milly
laughed
and
says
she
know
what
you
mean
aunt
jane
it
mighty
hard
for
me
to
keep
from
tellin
everything
i
know
and
some
things
i
do
know
but
says
she
never
goin
to
tell
this
even
to
sam
and
she
kept
her
word
too
every
once
in
a
while
she
come
up
to
me
and
whisper
ai
told
it
yet
aunt
jane
jest
to
see
me
laugh
as
soon
as
the
doors
was
open
after
we
all
got
through
and
puttin
on
the
ribbons
milly
went
and
hunted
sarah
jane
up
and
told
her
that
her
quilt
had
the
blue
ribbon
they
said
the
pore
thing
like
to
fainted
for
joy
she
turned
right
white
and
had
to
lean
up
against
the
post
for
a
while
before
she
could
git
to
the
floral
hall
i
never
shall
forgit
her
face
it
was
worth
a
dozen
premiums
to
me
and
milly
too
she
jest
stood
lookin
at
that
quilt
and
the
blue
ribbon
on
it
and
her
eyes
was
full
o
tears
and
her
lips
quiverin
and
then
she
started
off
and
brought
the
children
in
to
look
at
quilt
she
met
sam
on
the
way
out
and
says
she
what
do
you
reckon
my
quilt
took
the
premium
and
i
believe
in
my
soul
sam
was
as
much
pleased
as
sarah
jane
he
came
saunterin
up
to
look
unconcerned
but
anybody
could
see
he
was
mighty
well
satisfied
it
does
a
husband
and
wife
a
heap
o
good
to
be
proud
of
each
other
and
i
reckon
that
was
the
first
time
sam
ever
had
cause
to
be
proud
o
pore
sarah
jane
it
my
belief
that
he
thought
more
sarah
jane
all
the
rest
o
her
life
jest
on
account
o
that
premium
me
and
sally
ann
helped
her
pick
it
out
she
had
her
choice
betwixt
a
and
a
cup
and
she
took
the
cup
folks
used
to
laugh
and
say
that
that
cup
was
the
only
thing
in
sarah
jane
house
that
was
kept
clean
and
bright
and
if
it
had
been
solid
silver
wore
it
all
out
rubbin
it
up
sarah
jane
died
o
pneumonia
about
three
or
four
years
after
that
and
the
folks
that
nursed
her
said
she
would
take
a
drink
o
water
or
a
dose
o
medicine
out
o
any
cup
but
that
there
some
folks
child
that
do
have
to
do
anything
but
walk
along
and
hold
out
their
hands
and
the
premiums
jest
naturally
fall
into
and
there
others
that
work
and
strive
the
best
they
know
how
and
nothin
ever
seems
to
come
to
and
i
reckon
nobody
but
the
lord
and
sarah
jane
knows
how
much
happiness
she
got
out
o
that
cup
i
thankful
she
had
that
much
pleasure
before
she
died
there
was
a
quilt
hanging
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
that
had
about
it
a
certain
air
of
distinction
it
was
a
solid
mass
of
patchwork
composed
of
squares
parallelograms
and
hexagons
the
squares
were
of
dark
gray
and
the
hexagons
were
white
the
parallelograms
black
and
light
gray
i
felt
sure
that
it
had
a
history
that
set
it
apart
from
its
ordinary
fellows
where
did
you
get
the
pattern
aunt
jane
i
asked
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
the
old
lady
eyes
sparkled
and
she
laughed
with
pure
pleasure
that
what
everybody
says
she
exclaimed
jumping
up
and
spreading
the
favored
quilt
over
two
laden
chairs
where
its
merits
became
more
apparent
and
striking
there
ai
another
quilt
like
this
in
the
state
o
kentucky
or
the
world
for
that
matter
my
granddaughter
henrietta
mary
frances
youngest
child
brought
me
this
pattern
she
spoke
the
words
as
one
might
say
from
paradise
or
from
olympus
or
from
the
lost
atlantis
europe
was
evidently
a
name
to
conjure
with
a
country
of
mystery
and
romance
unspeakable
i
had
seen
many
things
from
many
lands
beyond
the
sea
but
a
quilt
pattern
from
europe
here
at
last
was
something
new
under
the
sun
in
what
shop
of
london
or
paris
were
quilt
patterns
kept
on
sale
for
the
american
tourist
you
see
said
aunt
jane
henrietta
married
a
mighty
rich
man
and
jest
as
good
as
he
rich
too
and
they
went
to
europe
on
their
bridal
trip
when
she
come
home
she
brought
me
the
prettiest
shawl
you
ever
saw
she
made
me
stand
up
and
shut
my
eyes
and
she
put
it
on
my
shoulders
and
made
me
look
in
the
and
then
she
says
brought
you
a
new
quilt
pattern
too
grandma
and
i
want
you
to
piece
one
quilt
by
it
and
leave
it
to
me
when
you
die
and
then
she
told
me
about
goin
to
a
town
over
yonder
they
call
florence
and
how
she
went
into
a
big
church
that
was
built
hundreds
o
years
before
i
was
born
and
she
said
the
floor
was
made
o
little
pieces
o
colored
stone
all
laid
together
in
a
pattern
and
they
called
it
mosaic
and
says
i
has
it
got
anything
to
do
with
moses
and
his
law
you
know
the
commandments
was
called
the
mosaic
law
and
was
all
on
tables
o
stone
and
henrietta
jest
laughed
and
says
she
grandma
i
do
believe
it
has
but
says
she
minute
i
stepped
on
that
pavement
i
thought
about
you
and
i
drew
this
pattern
off
on
a
piece
o
paper
and
brought
it
all
the
way
to
kentucky
for
you
to
make
a
quilt
by
henrietta
bought
the
worsted
for
me
for
she
said
it
had
to
be
jest
the
colors
o
that
pavement
over
yonder
and
i
made
it
that
very
winter
aunt
jane
was
regarding
the
quilt
with
worshipful
eyes
and
it
really
was
an
effective
combination
of
color
and
form
many
a
time
while
i
was
piecin
that
she
said
i
thought
about
the
man
that
laid
the
pavement
in
that
old
church
and
wondered
what
his
name
was
and
how
he
looked
and
what
he
think
if
he
knew
there
was
a
old
woman
down
here
in
kentucky
usin
his
patterns
to
make
a
bedquilt
it
was
indeed
a
far
cry
from
the
florentine
artisan
of
centuries
ago
to
this
humble
worker
in
calico
and
worsted
but
between
the
two
stretched
a
cord
of
sympathy
that
made
them
one
the
eternal
aspiration
after
beauty
honey
said
aunt
jane
suddenly
did
i
ever
show
you
my
premiums
and
then
with
pleasant
excitement
in
her
manner
she
arose
fumbled
in
her
deep
pocket
for
an
ancient
bunch
of
keys
and
unlocked
a
cupboard
on
one
side
of
the
fireplace
one
by
one
she
drew
them
out
unrolled
the
soft
yellow
that
enfolded
them
and
ranged
them
in
a
stately
line
on
the
old
cherry
nineteen
sterling
silver
cups
and
goblets
abram
took
some
of
on
his
fine
stock
and
i
took
some
of
on
my
quilts
and
bread
and
cakes
she
said
impressively
to
the
artist
his
medals
to
the
soldier
his
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
to
aunt
jane
her
silver
cups
all
the
triumph
of
a
humble
life
was
symbolized
in
these
shining
things
they
were
simple
and
genuine
as
the
days
in
which
they
were
made
a
few
of
them
boasted
a
beaded
edge
or
a
golden
lining
but
no
engraving
or
embossing
marred
their
silver
purity
on
the
bottom
of
each
was
the
stamp
john
akin
danville
there
they
stood
filled
to
the
brim
with
precious
memories
memories
of
the
time
when
she
and
abram
had
worked
together
in
field
or
garden
or
home
and
the
county
fair
brought
to
all
a
yearly
opportunity
to
stand
on
the
height
of
achievement
and
know
somewhat
the
taste
of
fame
enchanted
cup
there
one
for
every
child
and
every
grandchild
she
said
quietly
as
she
began
wrapping
them
in
the
silky
paper
and
storing
them
carefully
away
in
the
cupboard
there
to
rest
until
the
day
when
children
and
grandchildren
would
claim
their
own
and
the
treasures
of
the
dead
would
come
forth
from
the
darkness
to
stand
as
heirlooms
on
fashionable
sideboards
and
tables
did
you
ever
think
child
she
said
presently
how
much
piecin
a
quilt
like
livin
a
life
and
as
for
sermons
why
they
ai
no
better
sermon
to
me
than
a
patchwork
quilt
and
the
doctrines
is
right
there
a
heap
they
are
in
the
catechism
many
a
time
i
set
and
listened
to
parson
page
preachin
about
predestination
and
and
i
said
to
myself
i
ai
never
been
through
centre
college
up
at
danville
but
if
i
could
jest
git
up
in
the
pulpit
with
one
of
my
quilts
i
could
make
it
a
heap
plainer
to
folks
than
parson
makin
it
with
all
his
big
words
you
see
you
start
out
with
jest
so
much
caliker
you
do
go
to
the
store
and
pick
it
out
and
buy
it
but
the
neighbors
will
give
you
a
piece
here
and
a
piece
there
and
you
have
a
piece
left
every
time
you
cut
out
a
dress
and
you
take
jest
what
happens
to
come
and
that
like
predestination
but
when
it
comes
to
the
cuttin
out
why
you
free
to
choose
your
own
pattern
you
can
give
the
same
kind
o
pieces
to
two
persons
and
one
make
a
and
one
make
a
chase
and
there
be
two
quilts
made
out
o
the
same
kind
o
pieces
and
jest
as
different
as
they
can
be
and
that
is
jest
the
way
with
livin
the
lord
sends
us
the
pieces
but
we
can
cut
out
and
put
together
pretty
much
to
suit
ourselves
and
there
a
heap
more
in
the
cuttin
out
and
the
sewin
than
there
is
in
the
caliker
the
same
sort
o
things
comes
into
all
lives
jest
as
the
apostle
says
hath
no
trouble
taken
you
but
is
common
to
all
men
the
same
trouble
come
into
two
people
lives
and
one
take
it
and
make
one
thing
out
of
it
and
the
other
make
somethin
entirely
different
there
was
mary
harris
and
mandy
crawford
they
both
lost
their
husbands
the
same
year
and
mandy
set
down
and
cried
and
worried
and
wondered
what
on
earth
she
was
goin
to
do
and
the
farm
went
to
wrack
and
the
children
turned
out
bad
and
she
had
to
live
with
her
in
her
old
age
but
mary
she
got
up
and
went
to
work
and
made
everybody
about
her
work
too
and
she
managed
the
farm
it
ever
had
been
managed
before
and
the
boys
all
come
up
steady
men
and
there
was
a
woman
in
the
county
better
fixed
up
than
mary
harris
things
is
predestined
to
come
to
us
honey
but
we
jest
as
free
as
air
to
make
what
we
please
out
of
and
when
it
comes
to
puttin
the
pieces
together
there
another
time
when
we
free
you
do
trust
to
luck
for
the
caliker
to
put
your
quilt
together
with
you
go
to
the
store
and
pick
it
out
yourself
any
color
you
like
there
folks
that
always
looks
on
the
bright
side
and
makes
the
best
of
everything
and
that
like
puttin
your
quilt
together
with
blue
or
pink
or
white
or
some
other
pretty
color
and
there
folks
that
never
see
anything
but
the
dark
side
and
always
lookin
for
trouble
and
treasurin
it
up
after
they
git
it
and
they
puttin
their
lives
together
with
black
jest
like
you
would
put
a
quilt
together
with
some
dark
ugly
color
you
can
spoil
the
prettiest
quilt
pieces
that
ever
was
made
jest
by
puttin
together
with
the
wrong
color
and
the
best
sort
o
life
is
miserable
if
you
do
look
at
things
right
and
think
about
right
then
there
another
thing
i
seen
folks
piece
and
piece
but
when
it
come
to
puttin
the
blocks
together
and
quiltin
and
linin
it
they
give
out
and
that
like
folks
that
do
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
but
their
lives
ai
of
much
use
after
all
any
a
lot
o
loose
pieces
o
patchwork
and
then
while
you
livin
your
life
it
looks
pretty
much
like
a
jumble
o
quilt
pieces
before
they
put
together
but
when
you
git
through
with
it
or
pretty
nigh
through
as
i
am
now
you
see
the
use
and
the
purpose
of
everything
in
it
everything
be
in
its
right
place
jest
like
the
squares
in
this
and
one
piece
may
be
pretty
and
another
one
ugly
but
it
all
looks
right
when
you
see
it
finished
and
joined
together
did
i
say
that
every
pattern
was
represented
no
there
was
one
notable
omission
not
a
single
crazy
quilt
was
there
in
the
collection
i
called
aunt
jane
attention
to
this
lack
child
she
said
i
used
to
say
there
was
anything
i
could
do
if
i
made
up
my
mind
to
it
but
i
had
seen
a
quilt
then
the
first
one
i
ever
seen
was
up
at
danville
at
mary
frances
and
henrietta
says
grandma
you
got
to
make
a
crazy
quilt
you
made
every
other
sort
that
ever
was
heard
of
and
she
brought
me
the
pieces
and
showed
me
how
to
baste
on
the
square
and
said
she
work
the
fancy
stitches
around
for
me
well
i
set
there
all
the
mornin
tryin
to
fix
up
that
square
and
the
more
i
tried
the
uglier
and
crookeder
the
thing
looked
and
finally
i
says
child
take
your
pieces
if
i
was
to
make
this
the
way
you
want
me
to
they
be
a
crazy
quilt
and
a
crazy
woman
too
aunt
jane
was
laying
the
folded
quilts
in
neat
piles
here
and
there
about
the
room
there
was
a
look
of
unspeakable
satisfaction
on
her
face
the
look
of
the
creator
who
sees
his
completed
work
and
pronounces
it
good
i
been
a
hard
worker
all
my
life
she
said
seating
herself
and
folding
her
hands
restfully
but
all
my
work
has
been
the
kind
that
with
the
usin
as
the
bible
says
that
the
discouragin
thing
about
a
woman
work
milly
amos
used
to
say
that
if
a
woman
was
to
see
all
the
dishes
that
she
had
to
wash
before
she
died
piled
up
before
her
in
one
pile
she
lie
down
and
die
right
then
and
there
i
always
had
the
name
o
bein
a
good
housekeeper
but
when
i
dead
and
gone
there
ai
anybody
goin
to
think
o
the
floors
i
swept
and
the
tables
i
scrubbed
and
the
old
clothes
i
patched
and
the
stockin
i
darned
abram
might
remembered
it
but
he
ai
here
but
when
one
o
my
grandchildren
or
sees
one
o
these
quilts
they
think
about
aunt
jane
and
wherever
i
am
then
i
know
i
ai
forgotten
i
reckon
everybody
wants
to
leave
somethin
behind
that
last
after
they
dead
and
gone
it
do
look
like
it
worth
while
to
live
unless
you
can
do
that
the
bible
says
folks
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
but
that
ai
so
they
go
and
maybe
they
do
rest
but
their
works
stay
right
here
unless
the
sort
that
do
outlast
the
usin
now
some
folks
has
money
to
build
monuments
with
great
tall
marble
pillars
with
angels
on
top
of
like
you
see
in
cave
hill
and
them
big
city
and
some
folks
can
build
churches
and
schools
and
hospitals
to
keep
folks
in
mind
of
but
all
the
work
i
got
to
leave
behind
me
is
jest
these
quilts
and
sometimes
when
i
settin
here
workin
with
my
caliker
and
gingham
pieces
i
finish
off
a
block
and
i
laugh
and
say
to
myself
here
another
stone
for
the
monument
i
reckon
you
think
child
that
a
caliker
or
a
worsted
quilt
is
a
curious
sort
of
a
monument
as
perishable
as
the
sweepin
and
scrubbin
and
mendin
but
if
folks
values
things
rightly
and
knows
how
to
take
care
of
there
ai
many
things
that
last
a
quilt
why
i
got
a
blue
and
white
counterpane
that
my
mother
spun
and
wove
and
there
ai
a
sign
o
givin
out
in
it
yet
i
goin
to
will
that
to
my
granddaughter
that
lives
in
danville
mary
frances
oldest
child
she
was
down
here
last
summer
and
i
was
lookin
over
my
things
and
packin
away
and
she
happened
to
see
that
counterpane
and
says
she
i
want
you
to
will
me
that
and
says
i
do
you
want
with
that
old
thing
honey
you
know
you
would
sleep
under
such
a
counterpane
as
that
and
says
she
but
i
hang
it
up
over
my
parlor
door
for
a
portière
i
suggested
as
aunt
jane
hesitated
for
the
unaccustomed
word
that
it
child
somehow
i
ca
ricollect
these
words
any
i
can
understand
these
ways
who
ever
thought
that
folks
go
to
stringin
up
in
their
doors
and
says
i
to
janie
can
hang
your
counterpane
up
in
your
parlor
door
if
you
want
to
but
says
i
you
ever
make
a
out
o
one
o
my
quilts
but
la
the
way
things
turn
around
if
i
was
to
come
back
fifty
years
from
now
like
as
not
i
find
usin
my
quilts
for
or
we
both
laughed
and
there
rose
in
my
mind
a
picture
of
a
house
decorated
with
aunt
jane
and
rising
suns
how
could
the
dear
old
woman
know
that
the
same
esthetic
sense
that
had
drawn
from
their
obscurity
the
white
and
blue
counterpanes
of
colonial
days
would
forever
protect
her
loved
quilts
from
such
a
desecration
as
she
feared
as
she
lifted
a
pair
of
quilts
from
a
chair
near
by
i
caught
sight
of
a
pure
white
spread
in
striking
contrast
with
the
patchwork
where
did
you
get
that
marseilles
spread
aunt
jane
i
asked
pointing
to
it
aunt
jane
lifted
it
and
laid
it
on
my
lap
without
a
word
evidently
she
thought
that
here
was
something
that
could
speak
for
itself
it
was
two
layers
of
snowy
cotton
cloth
thinly
lined
with
cotton
and
elaborately
quilted
into
a
perfect
imitation
of
a
marseilles
counterpane
the
pattern
was
a
tracery
of
roses
buds
and
leaves
very
much
conventionalized
but
still
recognizable
for
the
things
they
were
the
stitches
were
fairylike
and
altogether
it
might
have
covered
the
bed
of
a
queen
i
made
every
stitch
o
that
spread
the
year
before
me
and
abram
was
married
she
said
i
put
it
on
my
bed
when
we
went
to
housekeepin
it
was
on
the
bed
when
abram
died
and
when
i
die
i
want
to
cover
me
with
it
there
was
a
in
the
simple
words
i
thought
of
desdemona
and
her
bridal
sheets
and
i
did
not
offer
to
help
aunt
jane
as
she
folded
this
quilt
i
reckon
you
think
she
resumed
presently
that
i
a
mean
stingy
old
creetur
not
to
give
janie
the
counterpane
now
instead
o
it
up
and
all
these
quilts
too
and
keepin
folks
waitin
for
till
i
die
but
honey
it
ai
all
selfishness
i
give
away
my
best
dress
or
my
best
bonnet
or
an
acre
o
ground
to
anybody
that
needed
i
did
but
these
quilts
why
it
looks
like
my
whole
life
was
sewed
up
in
and
i
ai
goin
to
part
with
while
life
lasts
there
was
a
ring
of
passionate
eagerness
in
the
old
voice
and
she
fell
to
putting
away
her
treasures
as
if
the
suggestion
of
losing
them
had
made
her
fearful
of
their
safety
i
looked
again
at
the
heap
of
quilts
an
hour
ago
they
had
been
patchwork
and
nothing
more
but
now
the
old
woman
words
had
wrought
a
transformation
in
the
homely
mass
of
calico
and
silk
and
worsted
patchwork
ah
no
it
was
memory
imagination
history
biography
joy
sorrow
philosophy
religion
romance
realism
life
love
and
death
and
over
all
like
a
halo
the
love
of
the
artist
for
his
work
and
the
soul
longing
for
earthly
immortality
no
wonder
the
wrinkled
fingers
smoothed
them
as
reverently
as
we
handle
the
garments
of
the
dead
iv
sweet
day
of
rest
illustration
i
walked
slowly
down
the
big
road
that
sunday
afternoon
slowly
as
befitted
the
scene
and
the
season
for
who
would
hurry
over
the
path
that
summer
has
prepared
for
the
feet
of
earth
tired
pilgrims
it
was
the
middle
of
june
and
nature
lay
a
vision
of
beauty
in
her
vesture
of
flowers
leaves
and
blossoming
grasses
the
sandy
road
was
a
pleasant
and
if
one
tired
of
that
the
short
thick
grass
on
either
side
held
a
fairy
path
fragrant
with
pennyroyal
that
most
virtuous
of
herbs
a
tall
hedge
of
osage
orange
bordered
each
side
of
the
road
shading
the
traveler
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
furnishing
a
for
numberless
small
birds
that
twittered
and
chirped
their
joy
in
life
and
love
and
june
occasionally
a
gap
in
the
foliage
revealed
the
placid
beauty
of
corn
oats
and
clover
stretching
in
broad
expanse
to
the
distant
purple
woods
with
here
and
there
a
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
the
wheat
that
waited
the
hand
of
the
mower
not
only
is
it
the
traveler
manifest
duty
to
walk
slowly
in
the
midst
of
such
surroundings
but
he
will
do
well
if
now
and
then
he
sits
down
and
dreams
as
i
made
the
turn
in
the
road
and
drew
near
aunt
jane
house
i
heard
her
voice
a
high
sweet
quavering
treble
like
the
notes
of
an
ancient
harpsichord
she
was
singing
a
hymn
that
suited
the
day
and
the
hour
welcome
sweet
day
of
rest
that
saw
the
lord
arise
welcome
to
this
reviving
breast
and
these
rejoicing
eyes
mingling
with
the
song
i
could
hear
the
creak
of
her
old
chair
as
she
rocked
gently
to
and
fro
song
and
creak
ceased
at
once
when
she
caught
sight
of
me
and
before
i
had
opened
the
gate
she
was
hospitably
placing
another
chair
on
the
porch
and
smiling
a
welcome
come
in
child
and
set
down
she
exclaimed
moving
the
rocker
so
that
i
might
have
a
good
view
of
the
bit
of
landscape
that
she
knew
i
loved
to
look
at
now
child
how
did
you
know
i
love
to
smell
that
she
crushed
the
bunch
in
her
withered
hands
buried
her
face
in
it
and
sat
for
a
moment
with
closed
eyes
lord
lord
she
exclaimed
with
breath
if
i
could
jest
tell
how
that
makes
me
feel
i
been
smellin
all
my
life
and
now
when
i
get
hold
of
a
piece
of
it
sometimes
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
little
child
and
then
again
it
brings
up
the
time
when
i
was
a
gyirl
and
if
i
was
to
keep
on
settin
here
and
rubbin
this
in
my
hands
i
believe
my
whole
life
come
back
to
me
and
pinks
and
roses
any
sweeter
to
me
me
and
old
uncle
harvey
dean
was
jest
alike
about
many
a
time
i
seen
uncle
harvey
searchin
around
in
the
fence
corners
in
the
early
part
o
may
to
see
if
the
was
up
yet
and
in
time
you
never
saw
the
old
man
that
he
have
a
bunch
of
it
somewheres
about
him
aunt
maria
dean
used
to
say
there
was
dried
in
every
pocket
of
his
coat
and
he
used
to
put
a
big
bunch
of
it
on
his
piller
at
night
sundays
it
looked
like
uncle
harvey
could
enjoy
the
preachin
and
the
singin
unless
he
had
a
sprig
of
it
in
his
hand
and
i
ricollect
once
seein
him
git
up
durin
the
first
prayer
and
tiptoe
out
o
church
and
come
back
with
a
handful
o
that
he
gethered
across
the
road
and
he
set
and
smell
it
and
look
as
pleased
as
a
child
with
a
piece
o
candy
piercing
sweet
the
breath
of
the
crushed
wayside
herb
rose
on
the
air
i
had
a
distinct
vision
of
uncle
harvey
dean
and
wondered
if
the
fields
of
asphodel
might
not
yield
him
some
small
harvest
of
his
earthly
plant
or
if
he
might
not
be
drawn
earthward
in
time
i
was
jest
settin
here
restin
resumed
aunt
jane
and
about
milly
amos
i
reckon
you
heard
me
singin
fit
to
scare
the
crows
as
you
come
along
we
used
to
call
that
milly
amos
hymn
and
i
never
can
hear
it
without
thinkin
o
milly
why
was
it
milly
amos
hymn
i
asked
aunt
jane
laughed
blithely
la
child
she
said
do
you
ever
git
tired
o
my
yarns
here
it
is
sunday
and
you
tryin
to
git
me
started
talkin
and
when
i
git
started
you
know
there
ai
any
tellin
when
i
stop
come
on
and
le
look
at
the
gyarden
that
more
fittin
for
sunday
evenin
than
tellin
yarns
so
together
we
went
into
the
garden
and
marveled
happily
over
the
growth
of
the
tasseling
corn
the
extraordinarily
long
runners
on
the
young
strawberry
plants
the
size
of
the
green
tomatoes
and
all
the
rest
of
the
miracles
that
sunshine
and
rain
had
wrought
since
my
last
visit
the
first
man
and
the
first
woman
were
gardeners
and
there
is
something
wrong
in
any
descendant
of
theirs
who
does
not
love
a
garden
he
is
lacking
in
a
primal
instinct
but
aunt
jane
was
in
this
respect
a
true
daughter
of
eve
a
faithful
with
the
sunshine
the
winds
the
rain
and
all
other
forces
of
nature
what
do
you
reckon
folks
do
she
inquired
if
it
was
for
and
and
i
heard
folks
say
they
was
tired
o
livin
but
as
long
as
there
a
gyarden
to
be
planted
and
looked
after
there
somethin
to
live
for
and
unless
there
gyardens
in
heaven
i
pretty
certain
i
ai
goin
to
be
satisfied
there
but
the
charms
of
the
garden
could
not
divert
me
from
the
main
theme
and
when
we
were
seated
again
on
the
front
porch
i
returned
to
milly
amos
and
her
hymn
you
know
i
said
that
there
is
any
more
harm
in
talking
about
a
thing
on
sunday
than
there
is
in
thinking
about
it
and
aunt
jane
yielded
to
the
force
of
my
logic
i
reckon
you
heard
me
tell
many
a
time
about
our
choir
she
began
smoothing
out
her
black
silk
apron
with
fingers
that
evidently
felt
the
need
of
knitting
or
some
other
form
of
familiar
work
john
petty
was
the
bass
sam
crawford
the
tenor
my
jane
was
the
alto
and
milly
amos
sung
soprano
i
reckon
milly
might
been
called
the
leader
of
the
choir
she
was
the
sort
o
woman
that
generally
leads
wherever
she
happens
to
be
and
she
had
the
strongest
finest
voice
in
the
whole
congregation
all
the
parts
appeared
to
depend
on
her
and
it
seemed
like
her
voice
jest
carried
the
rest
o
the
voices
along
like
one
big
river
that
takes
up
all
the
little
rivers
and
carries
down
to
the
ocean
i
used
to
think
about
the
difference
between
her
voice
and
miss
penelope
milly
was
jest
as
clear
and
true
as
miss
penelope
and
four
or
five
times
as
strong
but
i
ruther
hear
one
note
o
miss
penelope
than
a
whole
song
o
milly
milly
was
jest
a
voice
and
miss
penelope
was
a
voice
and
somethin
else
besides
but
what
that
somethin
was
i
never
could
say
however
milly
was
the
very
one
for
a
choir
she
kind
o
kept
all
together
and
led
along
and
we
was
mighty
proud
of
our
choir
in
them
days
we
always
had
a
voluntary
after
we
got
our
new
organ
and
i
used
to
look
forward
to
sunday
on
account
o
that
voluntary
it
used
to
sound
so
pretty
to
hear
begin
singin
when
everything
was
still
and
solemn
and
i
can
never
forgit
the
hymns
they
sung
then
sam
and
milly
and
john
and
my
jane
but
there
was
one
sunday
when
milly
did
sing
her
and
sam
come
in
late
and
i
knew
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
milly
that
somethin
was
the
matter
generally
she
was
smilin
and
bowin
to
people
all
around
but
this
time
she
walked
in
and
set
the
children
down
and
then
set
down
herself
without
even
lookin
at
anybody
to
say
nothin
o
smilin
or
speakin
well
when
ten
come
my
jane
began
to
play
sweet
day
of
rest
and
all
of
begun
singin
except
milly
she
set
there
with
her
mouth
tight
shut
and
let
the
bass
and
tenor
and
alto
have
it
all
their
own
way
i
thought
maybe
she
was
out
o
breath
from
comin
in
late
and
in
a
hurry
and
i
looked
for
her
to
jine
in
but
she
jest
set
there
lookin
straight
ahead
of
her
and
when
sam
passed
her
a
she
took
hold
of
it
and
shut
it
up
and
let
it
drop
in
her
lap
and
there
was
the
tenor
and
the
bass
and
the
alto
doin
their
best
and
everybody
laughin
or
tryin
to
keep
from
laughin
i
reckon
if
uncle
jim
matthews
had
been
there
took
milly
place
and
helped
out
but
uncle
jim
been
in
his
grave
two
years
sam
looked
like
he
go
through
the
floor
he
was
so
mortified
and
he
kept
lookin
around
at
milly
as
much
as
to
say
do
you
sing
please
sing
milly
but
milly
never
opened
her
mouth
i
about
concluded
milly
must
have
the
sore
throat
or
somethin
like
that
but
when
the
first
hymn
was
give
out
milly
started
in
and
sung
as
loud
as
anybody
and
when
the
doxology
come
around
milly
was
on
hand
again
and
everybody
was
settin
there
wonderin
why
on
earth
milly
had
sung
in
the
voluntary
when
church
was
out
i
heard
sam
invitin
brother
hendricks
to
go
home
and
take
dinner
with
him
brother
hendricks
preached
for
us
that
day
and
they
all
drove
off
together
before
i
had
time
to
speak
to
milly
but
that
week
when
the
mite
society
met
milly
was
there
bright
and
early
and
when
we
all
got
fairly
started
with
our
sewin
and
everybody
was
in
a
sally
ann
says
says
she
i
want
to
know
why
you
did
sing
in
that
voluntary
sunday
i
reckon
everybody
here
wants
to
know
says
she
nobody
but
me
got
the
courage
to
ask
you
and
milly
face
got
as
red
as
a
beet
and
she
burst
out
laughin
and
says
she
declare
i
ashamed
to
tell
you
all
i
reckon
satan
himself
must
been
in
me
last
sunday
you
know
says
she
some
days
when
everything
goes
wrong
with
a
woman
and
last
sunday
was
one
o
them
days
i
got
up
early
says
she
dressed
the
children
and
fed
my
chickens
and
strained
the
milk
and
washed
up
the
milk
things
and
got
breakfast
and
washed
the
dishes
and
cleaned
up
the
house
and
gethered
the
vegetables
for
dinner
and
washed
the
hands
and
faces
and
put
their
sunday
clothes
on
and
jest
as
i
was
startin
to
git
myself
ready
for
church
says
she
happened
to
think
that
i
had
skimmed
the
milk
for
the
next
day
churnin
so
i
went
down
to
the
and
did
the
skimmin
and
jest
as
i
picked
up
the
to
put
it
up
on
that
shelf
sam
built
for
me
my
foot
slipped
says
she
down
i
come
and
skinned
my
elbow
on
the
rock
step
and
broke
the
jar
all
to
smash
and
spilled
the
cream
all
over
creation
and
there
i
was
four
pounds
o
butter
and
a
jar
gone
and
my
in
such
a
mess
that
i
through
cleanin
it
yet
and
my
right
arm
as
stiff
as
a
poker
ever
since
we
all
had
to
laugh
at
the
way
milly
told
it
and
sally
ann
says
that
was
enough
to
make
a
saint
mad
says
milly
you
all
know
i
far
from
bein
a
saint
however
says
she
picked
up
the
pieces
and
washed
up
the
worst
o
the
cream
and
then
i
went
to
the
house
to
git
myself
ready
for
church
and
before
i
could
git
there
i
heard
sam
hollerin
for
me
to
come
and
sew
a
button
on
his
shirt
one
of
had
come
off
while
he
was
tryin
to
button
it
and
when
i
got
out
my
the
children
had
been
playin
with
it
and
there
was
a
needle
in
it
and
my
thimble
was
gone
and
i
had
to
hunt
up
the
apron
i
was
makin
for
little
sam
and
git
a
needle
off
that
and
i
run
the
needle
into
my
finger
not
havin
any
thimble
and
got
a
blood
spot
on
the
bosom
o
the
shirt
then
says
she
i
could
git
my
dress
over
my
head
here
come
little
sam
with
his
clothes
all
dirty
where
he
fell
down
in
the
mud
and
there
i
had
him
to
dress
again
and
that
made
me
madder
still
and
then
when
i
finally
got
out
to
the
wagon
says
she
rubbed
my
clean
dress
against
the
wheel
and
that
made
me
mad
again
and
the
nearer
we
got
to
the
church
the
madder
i
was
and
now
says
she
you
reckon
after
all
i
been
through
that
mornin
and
dinner
ahead
of
me
to
git
and
the
children
to
look
after
all
the
evenin
do
you
reckon
that
i
felt
like
settin
up
there
and
singin
welcome
sweet
day
rest
says
she
ai
seen
any
day
o
rest
since
the
day
i
married
sam
and
i
do
expect
to
see
any
till
the
day
i
die
and
if
parson
page
wants
that
hymn
sung
let
him
git
up
a
choir
of
old
maids
and
old
bachelors
for
they
the
only
people
that
ever
see
any
rest
sunday
or
any
other
day
we
all
laughed
and
said
we
did
blame
milly
a
bit
for
not
that
hymn
and
then
milly
said
reckon
i
might
as
well
tell
you
all
the
whole
story
by
the
time
church
was
over
says
she
kind
cooled
off
but
when
i
heard
sam
askin
brother
hendricks
to
go
home
and
take
dinner
with
him
that
made
me
mad
again
for
i
knew
that
meant
a
big
dinner
for
me
to
cook
and
i
made
up
my
mind
then
and
there
that
i
would
cook
a
blessed
thing
company
or
no
company
sam
killed
chickens
the
night
before
says
she
they
was
all
dressed
and
ready
down
in
the
and
the
vegetables
was
right
there
on
the
back
porch
but
i
never
touched
says
she
happened
to
have
some
cold
ham
and
cold
mutton
on
hand
not
much
of
either
one
and
i
sliced
and
put
the
ham
in
one
end
o
the
big
and
the
mutton
in
the
other
with
a
big
bare
place
between
so
everybody
could
see
that
there
was
enough
of
either
one
to
go
and
then
says
she
sliced
up
a
loaf
o
my
bread
and
got
out
a
bowl
o
honey
and
a
dish
o
damson
preserves
and
then
i
went
out
on
the
porch
and
told
sam
that
dinner
was
ready
i
never
shall
forgit
how
we
all
laughed
when
milly
was
tellin
it
know
aunt
jane
says
she
quick
a
man
gits
up
when
you
tell
him
dinner
ready
well
sam
he
jumps
up
and
says
he
why
you
mighty
smart
milly
i
do
believe
there
another
woman
in
the
county
that
could
git
a
sunday
dinner
this
quick
and
says
he
walk
out
brother
hendricks
walk
right
out
here
aunt
jane
paused
to
laugh
again
at
the
scene
that
her
words
called
up
milly
used
to
say
that
sam
face
changed
a
flash
lightnin
when
he
saw
the
table
and
he
dropped
down
in
his
cheer
and
forgot
to
ask
brother
hendricks
to
say
grace
milly
says
he
the
dinner
where
them
chickens
i
killed
last
night
and
the
potatoes
and
corn
and
and
milly
jest
looked
him
square
in
the
face
and
says
she
chickens
are
in
the
and
the
vegetables
out
on
the
back
porch
and
says
she
you
suppose
i
goin
to
cook
a
hot
dinner
for
you
all
on
this
sweet
day
o
rest
aunt
jane
stopped
again
to
laugh
that
was
a
polite
way
for
anybody
to
talk
at
their
own
table
she
resumed
and
some
of
us
asked
milly
what
brother
hendricks
said
and
milly
face
got
as
red
as
a
beet
again
and
she
says
he
behaved
so
nice
he
made
me
feel
right
ashamed
o
myself
for
actin
so
mean
he
jest
reached
over
and
helped
himself
to
everything
he
could
reach
and
says
he
this
dinner
may
not
suit
you
brother
amos
but
it
plenty
good
for
me
and
jest
the
kind
i
used
to
at
home
says
he
i
rather
eat
a
cold
dinner
any
time
than
have
a
woman
over
a
hot
stove
for
me
and
when
he
said
that
milly
up
and
told
him
why
it
was
she
did
feel
like
gittin
a
hot
dinner
and
why
she
did
sing
in
the
voluntary
and
when
she
got
through
he
says
sister
amos
if
i
been
through
all
you
have
this
mornin
and
then
had
to
git
up
and
give
out
such
a
hymn
as
welcome
sweet
day
rest
i
believe
i
be
mad
enough
to
pitch
the
and
the
bible
at
the
deacons
and
the
elders
and
then
he
turns
around
to
sam
and
says
he
you
ever
think
brother
amos
that
there
ai
a
pleasure
men
enjoy
that
women
do
have
to
suffer
for
it
and
milly
said
that
made
her
feel
ever
and
when
come
she
lit
the
fire
and
got
the
best
hot
supper
she
could
fried
chicken
and
waffles
and
hot
and
coffee
and
goodness
knows
what
else
now
was
that
jest
like
a
woman
to
give
in
after
she
had
her
own
way
for
a
while
and
could
kept
on
havin
it
abram
used
to
say
that
women
and
runaway
horses
was
jest
alike
the
best
way
to
manage
both
was
to
give
the
rein
and
let
go
till
they
got
tired
and
they
always
stop
before
they
do
any
mischief
milly
said
that
supper
tickled
sam
pretty
near
to
death
sam
was
always
mighty
proud
o
milly
cookin
so
that
how
we
come
to
call
that
hymn
milly
amos
hymn
and
as
long
as
milly
lived
folks
look
at
her
and
laugh
whenever
the
preacher
give
out
sweet
day
o
rest
the
story
was
over
aunt
jane
folded
her
hands
and
we
both
surrendered
ourselves
to
happy
silence
all
the
faint
sweet
sounds
that
break
the
stillness
of
a
sunday
in
the
country
came
to
our
ears
in
gentle
symphony
the
lisp
of
the
leaves
the
chirp
of
young
chickens
lost
in
the
mazes
of
billowy
grass
and
the
rustle
of
the
silver
poplar
that
turned
into
a
mass
of
molten
silver
whenever
the
breeze
touched
it
when
you
lived
as
long
as
i
have
child
said
aunt
jane
presently
you
feel
that
you
lived
in
two
worlds
a
short
life
do
see
many
changes
but
in
eighty
years
you
can
see
old
things
passin
away
and
new
ones
comin
on
to
take
their
place
and
when
i
look
back
at
the
way
sunday
used
to
be
kept
and
the
way
it
kept
now
it
jest
like
bein
in
another
world
i
hear
folks
talkin
about
how
wicked
the
world
growin
and
wishin
they
could
go
back
to
the
old
times
but
it
looks
like
to
me
there
jest
as
much
kindness
and
goodness
in
folks
nowadays
as
there
was
when
i
was
young
and
as
for
keepin
sunday
why
i
noticed
all
my
life
that
the
folks
strictest
about
that
ai
always
the
best
christians
and
i
reckon
there
been
more
foolishness
preached
and
talked
about
keepin
the
sabbath
day
holy
than
about
any
other
one
thing
i
ricollect
some
years
ago
the
town
folks
got
to
sunday
mighty
strict
they
had
had
a
preacher
for
a
long
time
and
the
church
been
takin
things
easy
and
finally
they
got
a
new
preacher
from
down
in
tennessee
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
draw
the
lines
around
close
and
tight
about
keepin
sunday
some
o
the
members
had
been
in
the
habit
o
havin
their
wood
chopped
on
sunday
well
as
soon
as
the
new
preacher
come
he
said
that
sunday
had
to
cease
amongst
his
or
he
have
up
before
the
session
i
ricollect
old
judge
morgan
swore
he
have
his
wood
chopped
any
day
that
suited
him
and
he
had
a
load
o
wood
carried
down
cellar
and
the
nigger
man
chopped
all
day
long
down
in
the
cellar
and
nobody
ever
would
found
it
out
but
pretty
soon
they
got
up
a
big
revival
that
lasted
three
months
and
spread
out
into
the
country
and
bless
your
life
old
judge
morgan
was
one
the
first
to
be
converted
and
when
he
give
in
his
experience
he
told
about
the
and
how
he
hoped
to
be
forgiven
for
the
sabbath
day
well
of
course
us
people
out
in
the
country
would
be
outdone
by
the
town
folks
so
parson
page
got
up
and
preached
on
the
fourth
commandment
and
all
about
that
pore
man
that
was
stoned
to
death
for
pickin
up
a
few
sticks
on
the
seventh
day
and
sam
amos
he
says
after
meetin
broke
says
he
my
opinion
that
that
man
was
a
industrious
enterprisin
feller
that
was
probably
pickin
up
to
make
his
wife
a
fire
and
says
he
they
wanted
to
stone
anybody
to
death
they
better
picked
out
some
lazy
triflin
feller
that
did
have
energy
enough
to
work
sunday
or
any
other
day
sam
always
would
have
his
say
and
nothin
pleased
him
to
talk
back
to
the
preachers
and
git
the
better
of
in
a
argument
i
ricollect
us
women
talked
that
sermon
over
at
the
mite
society
and
maria
petty
says
do
know
but
what
it
a
wrong
thing
to
say
but
it
looks
to
me
like
that
commandment
was
intended
for
anybody
but
them
israelites
it
was
mighty
easy
for
them
to
keep
the
sabbath
day
holy
but
says
she
lord
do
rain
down
manna
in
my
yard
and
says
she
can
stop
plowin
and
plantin
on
sunday
but
they
do
stop
eatin
and
as
long
as
men
have
to
eat
on
sunday
women
have
to
work
and
sally
ann
she
spoke
up
and
says
she
so
and
these
very
preachers
that
talk
so
much
about
keepin
the
sabbath
day
holy
they
walk
down
out
o
their
pulpits
and
set
down
at
some
table
and
eat
fried
chicken
and
hot
biscuits
and
corn
bread
and
five
or
six
kinds
o
vegetables
and
never
think
about
the
work
it
took
to
git
the
dinner
to
say
nothin
o
the
to
come
after
there
one
thing
child
that
i
never
told
to
anybody
but
abram
i
reckon
it
was
wicked
and
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
own
it
but
here
her
voice
fell
to
a
confessional
key
i
never
did
like
sunday
till
i
begun
to
git
old
and
the
way
sunday
used
to
be
kept
it
looks
to
me
like
nobody
could
been
expected
to
like
it
but
old
folks
and
lazy
folks
you
see
i
never
was
one
o
these
folks
that
born
tired
i
loved
to
work
i
never
had
need
of
any
more
rest
than
i
got
every
night
when
i
slept
and
i
woke
up
every
mornin
ready
for
the
work
i
hear
folks
prayin
for
rest
and
wishin
for
rest
but
honey
all
my
prayer
was
give
me
work
and
strength
enough
to
do
it
and
when
a
person
looks
at
all
the
things
there
is
to
be
done
in
this
world
they
wo
feel
like
restin
when
they
ai
tired
abram
used
to
say
he
believed
i
tried
to
make
work
for
myself
sunday
and
every
other
day
and
i
ricollect
i
used
to
be
right
glad
when
any
o
the
neighbors
git
sick
on
sunday
and
send
for
me
to
help
nurse
nursing
the
sick
was
a
work
o
necessity
and
mercy
too
and
then
child
the
lord
do
ever
rest
the
bible
says
he
rested
on
the
seventh
day
when
he
got
through
makin
the
world
and
i
reckon
that
was
rest
enough
for
him
for
jest
look
everything
goes
on
sundays
jest
the
same
as
the
grass
grows
and
the
sun
shines
and
the
wind
blows
and
he
does
it
all
still
the
lord
is
lord
of
might
in
deeds
in
deeds
he
takes
delight
i
said
that
it
said
aunt
jane
delightedly
there
ai
any
religion
in
restin
unless
you
tired
and
work
jest
as
holy
in
his
sight
as
rest
our
faces
were
turned
toward
the
western
sky
where
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
amethystine
hills
the
swallows
were
darting
and
twittering
over
our
heads
a
somber
flock
of
blackbirds
rose
from
a
huge
oak
tree
in
the
meadow
across
the
road
and
darkened
the
sky
for
a
moment
in
their
flight
to
the
cedars
that
were
their
nightly
resting
place
gradually
the
mist
changed
from
amethyst
to
rose
and
the
poorest
object
shared
in
the
transfiguration
of
the
sunset
hour
is
it
unmeaning
chance
that
sets
man
days
his
dusty
common
days
between
the
glories
of
the
rising
and
the
setting
sun
and
his
life
his
dusty
common
life
between
the
two
solemnities
of
birth
and
death
bounded
by
the
splendors
of
the
morning
and
evening
skies
what
glory
of
thought
and
deed
should
each
day
hold
what
celestial
dreams
and
vitalizing
sleep
should
fill
our
nights
for
why
should
day
be
more
magnificent
than
life
as
we
watched
in
understanding
silence
the
enchantment
slowly
faded
the
day
of
rest
was
over
a
night
of
rest
was
at
hand
and
in
the
shadowy
hour
between
the
two
hovered
the
benediction
of
that
peace
which
passeth
all
understanding
v
milly
baker
boy
illustration
it
was
the
last
monday
in
may
and
a
steady
stream
of
wagons
carriages
and
horseback
riders
had
been
pouring
into
town
over
the
smooth
graveled
pike
aunt
jane
stood
on
her
front
porch
looking
around
and
above
with
evident
delight
this
was
her
gala
monday
and
if
any
thoughts
of
the
county
court
days
of
happier
years
were
in
her
mind
they
were
not
permitted
to
mar
her
enjoyment
of
the
present
there
were
no
waters
of
marah
near
her
spring
of
remembrance
clear
as
a
whistle
she
exclaimed
peering
through
the
tendrils
of
a
virginia
creeper
at
the
sea
of
blue
ether
where
fleecy
white
clouds
were
floating
driven
eastward
by
the
fresh
spring
wind
come
home
dry
last
time
they
was
as
wet
as
drowned
rats
yonder
comes
the
crawfords
and
there
jim
amos
on
horseback
in
front
of
how
d
jim
and
yonder
comes
richard
elrod
in
his
new
carriage
jest
look
at
him
i
do
believe
he
grows
younger
and
handsomer
every
day
of
his
life
a
woman
sat
beside
him
and
two
pretty
girls
were
in
the
seat
behind
them
bowing
courteously
to
the
old
woman
on
the
richard
elrod
looked
every
inch
a
king
of
the
soil
and
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
gentleman
farmer
of
kentucky
the
richest
man
in
the
county
said
aunt
jane
exultingly
as
she
followed
the
vanishing
carriage
with
her
keen
gaze
he
went
to
the
legislatur
last
winter
the
richard
elrod
they
call
him
now
and
i
can
remember
the
time
when
he
was
jest
milly
baker
boy
and
nothin
honorable
about
it
either
there
was
a
suggestion
of
a
story
in
the
words
and
in
the
look
in
aunt
jane
eyes
what
wonder
that
the
tides
of
thought
flowed
back
into
the
channel
of
old
times
on
a
day
like
this
when
every
passing
face
was
a
challenge
to
memory
it
needed
but
a
hint
to
bring
forth
the
recollections
that
the
sight
of
richard
elrod
had
stirred
to
life
the
rocker
and
the
basket
of
knitting
were
transferred
to
the
porch
and
with
the
beauty
and
the
music
of
a
spring
morning
around
us
i
listened
to
the
story
of
milly
baker
boy
i
hardly
know
jest
where
to
begin
said
aunt
jane
wrinkling
her
forehead
meditatively
and
adjusting
her
needles
tellin
a
story
is
somethin
like
windin
off
a
skein
o
yarn
there
jest
two
ends
to
the
skein
though
and
if
you
can
git
hold
o
the
right
one
it
easy
work
but
there
so
many
ways
o
beginning
a
story
and
you
never
know
which
one
leads
straightest
to
the
i
wonder
many
a
time
how
folks
ever
finds
out
where
to
begin
when
they
set
out
to
write
a
book
however
i
reckon
if
i
start
with
dick
elrod
i
git
through
somehow
or
other
you
asked
me
jest
now
who
richard
elrod
was
he
was
the
son
o
dick
elrod
and
dick
was
the
son
of
richard
elrod
the
old
squire
curious
how
you
name
two
boys
richard
and
one
of
will
always
be
called
richard
and
the
other
be
called
dick
nobody
ever
would
thought
o
callin
squire
elrod
he
was
richard
from
the
day
he
was
born
till
the
day
he
died
but
his
son
was
nothin
but
dick
all
his
life
richard
did
seem
to
fit
him
somehow
and
i
noticed
that
you
can
tell
what
sort
of
a
man
a
boy
goin
to
make
jest
by
knowin
whether
folks
calls
him
richard
or
dick
i
ai
sayin
that
every
richard
is
a
good
man
and
every
dick
a
bad
one
all
i
mean
is
that
there
as
much
difference
betwixt
a
and
a
as
there
is
betwixt
a
roastin
ear
and
a
peck
o
corn
meal
both
of
corn
and
both
of
may
be
good
but
they
ai
the
same
thing
by
a
long
jump
there
been
a
richard
in
the
elrod
family
as
far
back
as
you
could
track
all
of
good
steady
men
till
dick
come
along
he
was
an
only
child
and
of
course
that
made
a
bad
matter
worse
there
some
men
that
born
to
git
women
into
trouble
and
dick
was
one
of
jest
as
handsome
as
a
picture
and
two
years
ahead
o
his
age
when
it
come
to
size
and
a
way
about
him
from
the
time
he
put
on
pants
that
showed
jest
what
kind
of
a
man
he
was
cut
out
for
if
the
children
was
playin
put
the
kittle
on
dick
would
git
kissed
ten
times
to
any
other
boy
once
and
if
it
was
the
handkerchief
every
little
gyirl
in
the
ring
be
droppin
it
behind
dick
to
git
him
to
run
after
her
and
that
was
the
only
time
dick
ever
did
any
runnin
all
he
had
to
do
was
jest
to
sit
still
and
the
gyirls
did
the
runnin
it
was
that
way
all
his
life
and
folks
used
to
say
there
was
jest
one
woman
in
the
world
that
dick
could
make
a
fool
of
and
that
was
his
cousin
penelope
the
old
squire
child
she
used
to
come
down
to
the
squire
pretty
near
every
summer
and
when
dick
saw
how
high
and
mighty
she
was
he
begun
to
lay
himself
out
to
make
her
come
down
jest
where
the
other
women
was
not
because
he
keered
anything
for
her
such
men
never
keer
for
anybody
but
theirselves
he
jest
could
stand
it
to
have
a
woman
around
unless
she
was
throwin
herself
at
his
head
or
at
his
feet
but
he
do
anything
with
his
cousin
penelope
she
naturally
despised
him
and
he
hated
her
next
to
miss
penelope
the
only
girl
that
appeared
to
be
anything
like
a
match
for
dick
was
annie
crawford
old
man
bob
crawford
daughter
old
man
bob
was
one
o
the
kind
that
thinks
that
the
more
children
they
got
the
bigger
men
they
are
always
made
me
think
of
abraham
and
the
rest
o
the
old
patriarchs
to
see
him
come
walkin
into
church
with
them
nine
young
ones
at
his
heels
makin
so
much
racket
you
could
hear
the
sermon
he
was
mighty
proud
of
his
sons
but
after
bob
was
born
he
wanted
a
daughter
and
when
they
all
kept
turnin
out
boys
he
got
crazier
and
crazier
for
a
gyirl
annie
was
born
till
he
was
past
sixty
and
he
like
to
lost
his
senses
with
joy
it
was
harvestin
time
and
he
jest
stopped
work
and
set
on
his
front
porch
and
every
time
anybody
passed
by
he
holler
neighbor
it
a
gal
this
time
if
i
been
in
ann
place
i
gagged
him
but
la
she
thought
everything
he
did
was
all
right
it
got
to
be
a
joke
with
the
neighbors
to
ask
old
man
bob
how
many
children
he
had
and
he
give
a
big
laugh
and
say
neighbor
and
all
of
gals
but
nine
well
of
course
annie
was
bound
to
be
spoiled
especially
as
her
mother
died
when
she
was
jest
four
years
old
how
ann
ever
stood
old
man
bob
and
them
nine
boys
as
long
as
she
did
was
a
mystery
to
everybody
ann
had
done
her
best
to
manage
annie
with
old
man
bob
pullin
against
her
all
the
time
but
after
she
died
annie
took
the
place
and
everything
and
everybody
on
it
old
man
bob
had
raised
all
his
boys
on
principle
but
when
annie
come
he
turned
his
back
on
solomon
and
give
out
that
annie
must
be
crossed
by
anybody
sam
amos
asked
him
once
how
he
come
to
change
his
mind
so
about
raisin
children
and
old
man
bob
said
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
that
text
ought
to
read
the
rod
and
spile
the
boy
that
solomon
had
too
much
regyard
for
women
to
want
to
whip
a
gal
child
if
ever
there
was
an
old
idiot
he
was
one
i
mean
old
man
bob
not
solomon
though
solomon
was
as
wise
as
he
might
been
in
some
things
well
annie
was
a
headstrong
child
to
begin
with
and
havin
nobody
to
control
her
she
got
to
be
the
worst
young
one
i
reckon
in
the
state
o
kentucky
i
used
to
feel
right
sorry
for
her
little
brothers
they
could
keep
a
top
or
a
ball
or
marble
or
any
plaything
to
save
their
lives
annie
would
cry
for
jest
for
pure
meanness
and
whatever
it
was
that
annie
cried
for
they
had
to
give
it
up
or
git
a
whippin
she
break
up
their
and
their
and
the
little
wheelbarrers
and
wagons
they
make
and
they
did
have
any
peace
at
home
pore
little
motherless
things
i
ricollect
one
day
little
jim
come
runnin
over
to
my
house
his
wagon
loaded
up
with
all
his
playthings
his
little
saw
and
hammer
and
some
nails
the
cyarpenters
had
give
him
when
old
man
bob
had
his
new
stable
built
and
says
he
jane
please
let
me
keep
my
tools
over
here
annie
says
she
goin
to
throw
in
the
well
and
pappy
make
me
give
to
her
if
she
cries
for
them
tools
stayed
at
my
house
till
jim
outgrowed
and
he
and
henry
the
other
little
one
used
to
come
and
stay
by
the
hour
playin
with
my
abram
it
was
all
old
man
bob
could
do
to
git
a
housekeeper
to
stay
with
him
when
annie
got
older
one
spring
she
broke
up
all
the
hen
nests
and
turkey
nests
on
the
farm
and
they
had
to
buy
chickens
all
summer
and
turkeys
all
next
winter
they
used
to
tell
how
she
stood
and
hollered
for
two
hours
one
day
because
the
housekeeper
would
let
her
put
her
hand
into
a
kittle
o
boilin
lye
soap
it
my
belief
that
she
was
all
that
kept
old
man
bob
from
marryin
again
in
a
year
after
ann
died
he
courted
three
or
four
widders
and
old
maids
round
the
neighborhood
but
there
was
one
of
that
anxious
to
marry
that
she
take
old
man
bob
with
annie
thrown
in
as
soon
as
she
got
old
enough
old
man
bob
carried
her
with
him
wherever
he
went
county
court
days
you
see
him
goin
along
on
his
big
gray
mare
with
annie
behind
him
holdin
on
to
the
sides
of
his
coat
with
her
little
fat
hands
her
sunbonnet
fallin
off
and
her
curls
blowin
all
around
her
face
like
as
not
she
had
had
combed
for
a
week
and
in
the
evenin
about

here
they

say
the

bob
and
charged
him
two
or
three
prices
for
everything

holler
out

the
best
ai
good
enough
for

for
old
man

tellin
how
annie
had
growed
and
how
there
was
a
gal
in
the
state
that
could
hold
a
candle
to
her
and
sunday
he
come
walkin
in
church
with
annie
hangin
on
to
his
arm
jest
as
proud
and
happy
as
if
he
got
a
new
wife
annie
had
improved
wonderful
it
was
jest
her
looks
for
she
always
was
as
pretty
as
a
picture
but
she
was
as
a
gyirl
as
you
want
to
see
there
was
jest
as
much
difference
betwixt
her
then
and
what
she
used
to
be
as
there
is
betwixt
a
tame
fox
and
a
wild
one
of
course
the
wildness
is
all
there
but
it
kind
o
covered
up
under
a
lot
o
cute
little
tricks
and
ways
and
that
the
way
it
was
with
annie
squire
elrod
pew
was
jest
across
the
aisle
from
old
man
bob
and
i
could
see
dick
watchin
her
durin
church
time
but
annie
never
looked
one
way
nor
the
other
she
set
there
with
her
hands
folded
and
her
eyes
straight
before
her
and
nobody
ever
would
thought
that
she
been
horses
and
climbin
fences
ever
since
she
could
walk
mighty
near
when
she
come
back
from
school
in
june
it
was
the
same
thing
over
again
old
man
bob
braggin
on
her
and
everybody
sayin
how
sweet
and
pretty
she
was
dick
began
to
wait
on
her
right
away
and
before
long
folks
was
sayin
that
they
was
made
for
each
other
especially
as
their
farms
jined
that
a
fool
notion
but
you
ca
git
it
out
some
people
heads
things
went
on
this
way
for
two
or
three
years
annie
goin
and
comin
and
gittin
prettier
all
the
time
and
dick
waitin
on
her
whenever
she
was
at
home
and
carryin
on
between
times
with
every
gyirl
in
the
neighborhood
at
last
she
come
home
for
good
and
dick
dropped
all
the
others
in
a
hurry
and
set
out
in
earnest
to
git
annie
folks
said
he
was
mightily
in
love
but
accordin
to
my
way
thinkin
there
was
any
love
about
it
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
annie
knew
how
to
manage
him
and
the
other
gyirls
did
they
was
always
right
there
in
the
neighborhood
and
it
do
help
a
woman
to
be
always
under
a
man
nose
but
annie
was
here
and
there
and
everywhere
visitin
in
town
and
in
louisville
and
bringin
the
town
folks
and
the
city
folks
home
with
her
and
havin
dances
and
picnics
and
doin
all
she
could
to
make
dick
jealous
and
then
i
always
believed
that
annie
was
jest
as
crazy
about
dick
as
the
rest
the
gyirls
but
she
had
sense
enough
not
to
let
him
know
it
human
nature
you
know
to
want
things
that
hard
to
git
why
if
fleas
and
mosquitoes
was
sceerce
folks
would
go
to
huntin
and
makin
a
big
fuss
over
annie
made
herself
hard
to
git
and
why
dick
wanted
her
instead
o
harriet
amos
that
was
jest
as
good
lookin
and
better
in
every
other
way
than
annie
was
everybody
was
sayin
what
a
blessed
thing
it
was
and
now
dick
would
give
up
his
wild
ways
and
settle
down
and
be
a
comfort
to
the
squire
in
his
old
age
well
along
in
the
spring
a
year
after
annie
got
through
with
school
sally
ann
come
to
me
and
says
she
i
saw
last
night
and
it
been
botherin
me
ever
since
and
she
went
on
to
say
how
she
was
goin
home
about
dusk
and
how
she
seen
dick
elrod
and
little
milly
baker
at
the
turn
o
the
lane
that
used
to
lead
up
to
milly
house
was
standin
under
the
wild
cherry
tree
in
the
fence
corner
says
she
the
elderberry
bushes
was
so
thick
that
i
could
jest
see
dick
head
and
shoulders
and
the
top
of
head
but
they
looked
to
be
mighty
close
together
and
dick
was
stoopin
over
and
whisperin
somethin
to
her
well
that
set
me
to
thinkin
and
i
ricollected
seein
dick
down
the
lane
one
evenin
about
sunset
and
at
the
same
time
i
caught
sight
o
milly
walkin
away
in
the
opposite
direction
our
mite
society
met
that
day
and
sally
ann
and
me
had
it
up
and
we
all
talked
it
over
it
come
out
that
every
woman
there
had
seen
the
same
things
we
been
seein
but
nobody
said
anything
about
it
as
long
as
they
was
certain
ought
to
be
done
says
sally
ann
be
a
shame
to
let
that
pore
child
go
to
destruction
right
before
our
eyes
when
a
word
might
save
her
she
fatherless
and
pretty
near
motherless
too
says
she
you
see
the
bakers
was
tenants
of
old
squire
elrod
and
after
milly
father
died
o
consumption
the
old
squire
jest
let
live
on
the
same
as
before
mis
elrod
give
quiltin
and
sewin
to
do
and
they
had
their
little
gyarden
and
managed
to
git
along
well
enough
some
folks
called
pore
white
trash
they
was
pore
enough
goodness
knows
but
they
was
clean
and
and
that
two
things
that
never
is
i
used
to
hear
that
milly
mother
come
of
a
good
family
but
she
married
beneath
herself
and
got
down
in
the
world
like
folks
always
do
when
they
cast
off
by
their
own
people
milly
had
come
up
like
a
wild
rose
in
a
fence
corner
and
she
was
jest
the
kind
of
a
girl
to
be
fooled
by
a
man
like
dick
handsome
and
smooth
talkin
with
all
the
ways
and
manners
that
take
women
in
crawford
used
to
say
it
made
her
feel
like
a
queen
jest
to
see
dick
take
his
hat
off
to
her
if
men
manners
matched
their
hearts
honey
this
be
a
heap
easier
world
for
women
but
whenever
you
see
a
man
that
got
good
manners
and
a
bad
heart
you
may
know
there
trouble
ahead
for
some
woman
well
us
women
talked
it
over
till
dark
come
and
i
reckon
if
we
had
a
committee
to
look
after
milly
and
dick
somethin
might
have
been
done
but
everybody
business
is
nobody
business
and
i
thought
sally
ann
would
go
to
milly
and
give
her
a
word
o
warnin
and
sally
ann
thought
i
do
it
and
so
it
went
and
nothin
was
said
or
done
at
last
and
before
long
it
was
all
over
the
neighborhood
that
pore
little
milly
was
in
trouble
aunt
jane
paused
took
off
her
glasses
and
wiped
them
carefully
on
a
corner
of
her
gingham
apron
many
the
time
she
said
slowly
that
i
laid
awake
till
the
chickens
crowed
blamin
myself
and
wonderin
how
far
i
was
responsible
for
milly
mishap
i
lived
a
long
time
since
then
and
i
do
worry
any
more
about
such
things
there
some
things
got
to
be
and
when
a
person
is
all
wore
out
tryin
to
find
out
why
this
thing
happened
and
why
that
thing
did
happen
he
can
jest
throw
himself
back
on
the
eternal
decrees
and
it
like
layin
down
on
a
good
soft
feather
bed
after
you
done
a
hard
day
work
the
preachers
tell
you
that
every
man
is
his
brother
keeper
but
so
i
ai
my
brother
keeper
nor
my
sister
neither
there
jest
one
person
i
got
to
keep
and
that
myself
the
bible
says
word
spoken
in
due
season
how
good
it
is
but
when
folks
is
in
love
there
ai
any
due
season
for
speakin
words
to
there
was
emmeline
amos
her
father
told
her
if
she
married
hal
he
cut
her
name
out
o
the
family
bible
and
leave
her
clear
out
o
his
will
but
that
did
hinder
her
she
went
right
on
and
married
him
and
lived
to
rue
the
day
she
did
it
no
child
there
mighty
little
salvation
by
words
for
folks
that
in
love
i
reckon
if
a
word
from
me
would
saved
milly
the
word
would
been
given
to
me
and
the
season
too
and
as
they
was
why
i
any
call
to
blame
myself
abram
and
sam
crawford
did
try
to
talk
to
old
man
bob
but
la
you
might
as
well
talked
to
the
east
wind
all
he
said
was
annie
wants
dick
elrod
annie
shall
have
him
that
what
he
been
ever
since
annie
was
born
nobody
said
anything
to
annie
for
she
was
the
sort
o
girl
who
did
care
whose
feelin
was
tramped
on
if
she
jest
had
her
own
way
so
it
went
on
and
the
weddin
day
was
set
and
nothin
was
talked
about
but
annie
dress
and
annie
dress
and
how
many
ruffles
she
had
on
her
petticoats
and
what
the
lace
on
her
nightgowns
cost
and
all
the
time
there
was
pore
milly
baker
her
eyes
out
night
and
day
and
us
women
gittin
up
all
our
old
baby
clothes
for
dick
elrod
unborn
child
aunt
jane
dropped
her
knitting
in
her
lap
and
gazed
across
the
fields
as
if
she
were
seeking
in
the
sunlit
ether
the
faces
of
those
who
moved
and
spoke
in
her
story
a
farm
wagon
came
lumbering
through
the
stillness
and
she
gathered
up
the
double
thread
of
story
and
knitting
and
went
on
annie
always
said
she
was
goin
to
have
such
a
weddin
as
the
county
never
had
seen
and
she
kept
her
word
old
man
bob
had
the
house
fixed
up
inside
and
out
they
sent
up
to
louisville
for
the
cakes
and
things
and
the
weddin
cake
was
three
feet
high
there
was
a
solid
gold
ring
in
it
and
the
bridesmaids
cut
for
it
and
every
gyirl
there
had
a
slice
o
the
bride
cake
to
carry
home
to
dream
on
that
night
annie
weddin
dress
was
white
satin
so
heavy
it
stood
alone
so
they
said
and
old
man
bob
had
the
whole
neighborhood
laughin
tellin
how
many
heifers
and
steers
it
took
to
pay
for
the
lace
around
the
neck
of
it
annie
and
dick
was
married
in
october
about
the
time
the
leaves
fell
and
milly
boy
was
born
the
last
o
november
lord
lord
what
a
world
this
is
old
man
bob
would
hear
to
annie
leavin
him
so
they
stayed
right
on
in
the
old
home
place
in
them
days
folks
go
all
over
creation
as
soon
as
they
got
married
they
settled
down
to
housekeepin
like
sensible
folks
ought
to
do
old
lady
elrod
was
as
foolish
over
dick
as
old
man
bob
was
over
annie
and
it
was
laid
down
beforehand
that
they
was
to
spend
half
the
time
at
old
man
bob
and
half
the
time
at
the
squire
the
worst
thing
they
could
done
the
further
a
young
couple
can
git
from
the
old
folks
on
both
sides
the
better
for
everybody
concerned
and
besides
annie
was
the
kind
of
a
gyirl
to
git
along
with
dick
mother
a
gyirl
with
the
kind
o
raisin
annie
had
was
any
fit
for
a
particular
woman
like
old
lady
elrod
there
was
some
people
that
expected
a
heap
o
dick
after
he
married
but
i
never
did
if
a
man
ca
be
faithful
to
a
woman
before
he
marries
her
he
ai
likely
to
be
faithful
after
he
marries
her
and
shore
enough
the
shine
was
off
o
annie
weddin
clothes
before
dick
was
back
to
his
old
ways
drinkin
and
carryin
on
with
the
women
same
as
ever
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
him
and
annie
had
a
big
quarrel
and
old
man
bob
had
ordered
him
off
the
place
however
they
made
it
up
and
went
over
to
the
old
squire
to
live
and
things
went
on
well
enough
till
annie
baby
was
born
dick
had
set
his
heart
on
havin
a
boy
but
it
turned
out
a
girl
and
as
soon
as
they
told
him
he
never
even
asked
how
annie
was
but
jest
went
out
to
the
stable
and
saddled
his
horse
and
galloped
off
and
nobody
seen
him
for
two
days
he
need
took
on
so
for
the
pore
little
thing
did
live
but
a
week
annie
had
convulsions
over
dick
leavin
her
that
way
and
the
doctor
said
that
was
what
killed
the
child
annie
never
was
the
same
after
this
she
grieved
for
her
child
and
lost
her
good
looks
and
when
she
lost
them
she
lost
dick
it
was
long
before
dick
was
livin
with
his
father
and
she
with
hers
at
last
he
went
out
west
and
in
less
than
three
years
annie
died
and
a
good
thing
she
did
for
a
more
soured
disappointed
woman
could
been
found
anywhere
well
all
this
time
milly
baker
baby
was
growin
in
grace
you
might
say
and
a
finer
child
never
was
born
milly
had
named
him
richard
and
nature
had
wrote
his
father
name
all
over
him
he
was
the
livin
image
of
dick
all
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
that
was
milly
milly
worshiped
him
and
there
was
few
children
raised
any
carefuler
and
better
than
milly
baker
boy
that
was
what
we
always
called
him
milly
was
nothin
but
a
child
herself
when
he
was
born
but
all
at
once
she
appeared
to
turn
to
a
woman
acted
like
one
and
looked
like
one
it
ai
time
honey
that
makes
people
old
experience
some
folks
never
git
over
bein
children
and
some
never
has
any
childhood
and
pore
little
milly
was
cut
short
by
trouble
if
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
or
the
child
nobody
ever
knew
it
i
never
could
tell
whether
it
was
lack
of
sense
or
whether
she
jest
looked
at
things
different
from
the
rest
of
us
but
to
see
her
walk
in
church
holding
little
richard
by
the
hand
nobody
ever
would
thought
but
what
she
was
a
lawful
wife
no
woman
could
behaved
she
did
i
bound
to
say
she
got
better
lookin
all
the
time
but
she
was
as
steady
and
sober
as
if
she
been
sixty
years
old
parson
page
said
once
that
milly
baker
had
more
dignity
than
any
woman
young
or
old
that
he
ever
seen
it
seems
right
queer
to
talk
about
dignity
in
a
pore
gyirl
who
made
the
misstep
she
made
but
i
reckon
it
was
jest
that
that
made
us
all
come
to
treat
her
as
if
she
was
as
good
as
anybody
people
can
set
their
own
price
on
i
noticed
and
if
they
keep
it
set
folks
come
up
to
it
milly
did
seem
to
think
that
she
had
done
anything
wrong
and
when
she
brought
little
richard
up
for
baptism
there
was
a
dry
eye
in
the
church
and
when
she
joined
the
church
herself
there
was
anybody
mean
enough
to
say
a
word
against
it
not
even
silas
petty
squire
elrod
give
her
the
cottage
rent
free
after
her
mother
died
and
betwixt
nursin
and
doin
fine
needlework
she
made
a
good
for
herself
and
the
boy
little
richard
was
a
child
worth
workin
for
from
the
start
tall
and
straight
as
a
saplin
and
carried
himself
like
he
owned
the
earth
even
when
he
was
a
little
feller
it
looked
like
all
the
good
blood
on
both
sides
had
come
out
in
him
and
there
was
a
smarter
handsomer
boy
in
the
county
the
old
squire
thought
a
heap
of
him
and
but
his
pride
kept
him
from
ownin
the
child
outright
and
treatin
him
like
he
was
his
own
flesh
and
blood
richard
had
an
old
head
on
young
shoulders
though
he
was
as
full
o
life
as
any
boy
and
by
the
time
he
was
grown
the
old
squire
trusted
him
with
everything
on
the
place
and
looked
to
him
the
same
as
if
he
been
a
settled
man
after
old
lady
elrod
died
he
broke
terrible
fast
and
folks
used
to
say
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
see
him
when
he
be
watchin
richard
the
hands
and
tendin
to
things
about
the
place
he
lean
on
the
fence
his
hands
tremblin
and
his
face
workin
thinkin
about
dick
and
grievin
over
him
and
wishin
i
reckon
that
dick
had
been
such
a
man
as
milly
boy
was
all
these
years
nobody
ever
heard
from
dick
once
in
a
while
somebody
come
from
town
and
say
they
seen
somebody
that
had
seen
somebody
else
and
that
somebody
had
seen
dick
way
out
in
california
or
lord
knows
where
and
that
was
all
the
news
that
ever
come
back
we
all
jest
about
made
up
our
minds
that
he
was
dead
when
one
mornin
along
in
time
the
news
was
brought
and
spread
over
the
neighborhood
in
no
time
that
dick
elrod
had
come
home
and
was
lyin
at
the
of
death
i
remembered
hearin
a
hack
go
by
on
the
pike
the
night
before
and
wondered
to
myself
what
was
up
i
thought
maybe
it
was
a
runaway
couple
or
some
such
matter
but
it
was
pore
dick
comin
back
to
his
father
house
like
the
prodigal
son
after
twenty
years
it
takes
some
folks
a
long
time
child
to
git
tired
of
the
swine
and
the
husks
well
of
course
it
made
a
big
commotion
and
before
we
hardly
taken
it
in
we
heard
that
he
sent
for
milly
and
her
and
richard
had
gone
together
up
to
the
big
house
jane
ann
petty
was
keepin
house
for
the
old
squire
and
she
told
us
afterwards
how
it
all
come
about
we
had
a
young
probationer
preachin
for
us
that
summer
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
about
dick
he
goes
up
to
the
big
house
without
bein
sent
for
to
talk
to
him
about
his
soul
i
reckon
he
thought
it
be
a
feather
in
his
cap
if
he
could
convert
a
hardened
sinner
like
dick
jane
ann
said
they
took
him
into
dick
room
and
he
set
down
by
the
bed
and
begun
to
lay
off
the
plan
o
salvation
jest
like
he
was
preachin
from
the
pulpit
and
dick
listened
and
never
took
his
eyes
off
his
face
when
he
got
through
dick
says
says
he
you
mean
to
say
that
all
i
got
to
do
to
keep
out
of
hell
and
get
into
heaven
is
to
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
brother
jonas
he
says
my
dear
brother
believe
on
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
thou
shalt
be
saved
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
his
son
cleanseth
us
from
all
sin
and
they
said
dick
jest
laughed
a
curious
sort
o
laugh
and
says
he
a
pretty
god
that
make
such
a
bargain
as
that
and
says
he
was
born
bad
i
lived
bad
and
i
dyin
bad
but
i
ai
a
coward
nor
a
sneak
and
i
goin
to
hell
for
my
sins
like
a
man
like
a
man
do
you
hear
me
jane
ann
said
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
awful
and
the
preacher
turned
white
as
a
sheet
it
was
curious
talk
for
a
but
when
you
come
to
think
about
it
it
reasonable
enough
when
a
man
got
hell
in
his
heart
what
good
is
it
goin
to
do
him
to
git
into
heaven
what
indeed
i
echoed
thinking
how
delightful
it
was
that
aunt
jane
and
omar
khayyam
should
be
of
one
mind
on
this
subject
when
dick
said
this
the
young
preacher
got
up
to
go
but
dick
called
him
back
and
says
he
do
want
any
of
your
preachin
or
prayin
but
you
stay
here
there
another
sort
of
a
job
for
you
to
do
and
then
he
turned
around
to
the
old
squire
and
says
for
milly
when
we
all
heard
that
milly
been
sent
for
the
first
thing
we
thought
was
on
earth
is
milly
goin
to
tell
richard
all
got
to
know
i
never
used
to
think
we
was
anything
over
and
above
the
ordinary
out
in
our
neighborhood
but
when
i
ricollect
that
richard
elrod
come
up
from
a
boy
to
a
man
without
knowin
who
his
father
was
it
seems
like
we
must
known
how
to
hold
our
tongues
anyhow
there
was
man
woman
or
child
that
ever
hinted
to
milly
baker
boy
that
he
was
like
other
children
and
so
it
was
natural
for
us
to
wonder
how
milly
was
goin
to
tell
him
well
it
was
any
of
our
business
and
we
never
found
out
all
we
ever
did
know
was
that
milly
and
richard
walked
over
to
the
big
house
together
and
richard
held
his
head
as
high
as
ever
they
said
that
dick
give
a
start
when
milly
come
into
the
room
i
reckon
he
expected
to
see
the
same
little
girl
he
fooled
twenty
years
back
and
when
she
come
walkin
in
it
jest
took
him
by
surprise
milly
says
he
this
you
and
he
held
out
his
hand
and
she
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
laid
her
hand
in
his
folks
that
was
there
say
it
was
a
strange
sight
for
any
one
that
remembered
what
them
two
used
to
be
her
so
gentle
and
and
him
all
wore
out
with
bad
livin
and
wasted
to
a
shadder
of
what
he
used
to
be
i
seen
the
same
thing
child
over
and
over
again
two
start
out
together
and
after
a
while
they
git
separated
or
maybe
they
live
together
a
lifetime
and
when
they
git
to
the
end
o
fifteen
or
twenty
or
years
one
be
jest
where
he
was
when
they
set
out
and
the
other
be
up
and
on
and
they
jest
nothin
but
strangers
after
all
that
the
way
it
was
with
milly
and
dick
they
been
sweethearts
and
there
was
the
child
but
the
father
gone
his
way
and
the
mother
gone
hers
and
now
there
was
somethin
between
like
that
gulf
the
bible
tells
about
well
they
said
dick
looked
up
at
milly
like
a
hungry
man
looks
at
bread
and
at
last
he
says
goin
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
you
milly
and
milly
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
said
as
gentle
and
easy
as
if
she
been
talkin
to
a
sick
child
always
been
an
honest
woman
dick
this
kind
o
took
him
back
again
but
he
says
right
earnest
and
pitiful
want
to
marry
you
milly
do
refuse
me
i
want
to
do
one
decent
thing
before
i
die
i
come
all
the
way
from
california
just
for
this
surely
you
feel
better
if
you
are
my
lawful
wife
and
they
said
milly
thought
a
minute
and
then
she
says
believe
it
makes
any
difference
with
me
dick
i
been
through
the
worst
and
i
used
to
it
but
if
it
make
it
any
easier
for
you
i
marry
you
and
then
there
my
boy
maybe
it
will
be
better
for
him
the
boy
says
dick
want
to
see
him
so
milly
went
and
called
richard
in
and
as
soon
as
dick
saw
him
he
raised
up
on
his
elbow
weak
as
he
was
and
hollered
out
so
you
could
hear
him
in
the
next
room
says
he
myself
it
myself
stand
off
there
where
i
can
see
you
boy
why
you
the
man
i
ought
to
have
been
and
could
be
these
lyin
doctors
says
he
me
that
i
got
a
day
to
live
but
i
goin
to
live
another
lifetime
in
you
and
then
he
fell
back
gaspin
for
breath
and
young
richard
stood
there
in
the
middle
o
the
floor
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
face
lookin
like
it
was
made
of
stone
as
soon
as
dick
could
speak
they
said
he
pulled
milly
down
and
whispered
something
to
her
and
she
went
over
to
the
chair
where
his
clothes
was
hangin
and
felt
in
the
pocket
of
the
vest
and
got
a
little
pearl
ring
out
they
said
she
shook
like
a
leaf
when
she
saw
it
and
dick
says
took
it
away
from
you
milly
twenty
years
ago
for
fear
you
use
it
for
evidence
against
me
scoundrel
that
i
was
and
now
i
goin
to
put
it
on
your
finger
again
and
the
parson
shall
marry
us
fair
and
square
i
got
the
license
here
under
my
pillow
and
milly
leaned
over
and
lifted
him
and
propped
him
up
with
the
pillows
and
the
young
parson
said
the
ceremony
over
with
jane
ann
and
the
old
squire
for
witnesses
as
soon
as
the
parson
got
through
dick
says
wo
you
shake
hands
with
your
father
i
would
ask
you
before
but
richard
never
stirred
and
milly
got
up
and
went
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
says
son
come
and
speak
to
your
father
and
he
walked
up
and
took
dick
pore
wasted
hand
in
his
strong
one
and
the
old
squire
set
there
and
sobbed
like
a
child
jane
ann
said
he
held
on
to
richard
hand
and
looked
at
him
for
a
long
time
and
then
he
reached
under
the
pillow
and
brought
out
a
paper
and
says
he
my
will
open
it
after
i
gone
i
squandered
a
lot
o
money
out
west
but
there
a
plenty
left
and
that
minin
stock
make
you
a
rich
man
it
all
yours
and
your
mother
i
wish
it
was
more
says
he
you
a
son
that
a
king
be
proud
of
them
was
about
the
last
words
he
said
pendleton
said
he
live
through
the
night
and
sure
enough
he
begun
to
sink
as
soon
as
the
young
parson
left
and
he
died
the
next
mornin
about
daybreak
jane
ann
said
jest
before
he
died
he
opened
his
eyes
and
mumbled
somethin
and
milly
seemed
to
know
what
he
wanted
for
she
reached
over
and
put
richard
hand
on
hers
and
dick
and
he
breathed
his
last
jest
that
way
milly
would
let
a
soul
touch
the
corpse
but
her
and
richard
she
was
a
mighty
good
hand
at
layin
out
the
dead
and
them
two
washed
and
shrouded
the
body
and
laid
it
in
the
coffin
and
the
next
day
at
the
funeral
milly
walked
on
one
side
o
the
old
squire
and
richard
on
the
other
and
the
old
man
leaned
on
richard
like
he
found
a
prop
for
his
last
days
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
to
believe
in
signs
but
there
was
one
thing
the
day
of
the
buryin
that
i
shall
always
ricollect
it
had
been
rainin
off
and
on
all
day
a
soft
misty
sort
o
rain
that
good
for
growin
things
but
while
they
were
fillin
up
the
grave
and
smoothin
it
off
the
sun
broke
out
over
in
the
west
and
when
we
turned
around
to
leave
the
grave
there
was
the
brightest
prettiest
rainbow
you
ever
saw
and
when
milly
and
richard
got
into
the
old
squire
carriage
and
rode
home
with
him
that
rainbow
was
right
in
front
of
all
the
way
home
it
did
mean
much
for
milly
and
the
squire
but
i
could
help
thinkin
it
was
a
promise
o
better
things
for
richard
and
maybe
a
hope
for
pore
dick
milly
did
live
long
after
this
they
found
her
dead
in
her
bed
one
mornin
the
doctor
said
it
was
heart
disease
but
it
my
belief
that
she
jest
died
because
she
thought
she
could
do
richard
a
better
turn
by
dyin
than
livin
she
lived
for
him
twenty
years
and
seen
him
come
into
his
rights
and
i
reckon
she
thought
her
work
was
done
dyin
for
people
is
a
heap
livin
for
anyhow
the
old
squire
did
outlive
milly
many
years
and
when
he
died
richard
come
into
all
the
elrod
property
you
seen
the
elrod
place
ai
you
child
that
white
house
with
big
pillars
and
porches
in
front
of
it
it
three
miles
further
on
the
pike
and
folks
drive
out
there
jest
to
look
at
it
i
heard
call
it
a
mansion
or
some
such
name
as
that
it
was
all
run
down
when
richard
come
into
possession
of
it
but
now
it
one
o
the
finest
places
in
the
whole
state
that
the
way
it
is
with
families
one
tear
down
and
another
generation
build
up
richard
buildin
up
all
that
his
father
tore
down
and
i
in
hopes
his
work
last
for
many
a
day
aunt
jane
voice
ceased
and
there
was
a
long
silence
the
full
harvest
of
the
was
over
but
sometimes
there
was
an
aftermath
to
aunt
jane
tale
and
for
this
i
waited
i
looked
at
the
field
opposite
where
the
long
verdant
rows
gave
promise
of
the
autumn
reaping
and
my
thoughts
were
busy
tracing
backward
every
link
in
the
chain
of
circumstance
that
stretched
between
milly
baker
boy
of
forty
years
ago
and
the
handsome
prosperous
man
i
had
seen
that
morning
ah
a
goodly
tale
and
a
goodly
ending
aunt
jane
spoke
at
last
and
her
words
were
an
echo
of
my
thought
there
lots
of
satisfactory
things
in
this
world
child
she
said
beaming
at
me
over
her
spectacles
with
the
smile
of
the
optimist
who
is
born
not
made
there
a
satisfaction
in
roundin
off
the
toe
of
a
stockin
like
i
doin
now
and
knowin
that
your
work
goin
to
keep
somebody
feet
warm
next
winter
there
a
satisfaction
in
bakin
a
nice
light
batch
o
bread
for
the
children
to
eat
up
there
a
satisfaction
in
settin
on
the
porch
in
the
cool
o
the
evenin
and
thinkin
o
the
good
day
work
behind
you
and
another
good
day
that
comin
this
world
ai
a
vale
o
tears
unless
you
make
it
so
on
purpose
but
of
all
the
satisfactions
i
ever
experienced
the
most
satisfyin
is
to
see
people
git
their
just
deserts
right
here
in
this
world
i
do
blame
david
for
bein
out
patience
when
he
saw
the
wicked
flourishin
like
a
green
bay
tree
i
never
was
any
hand
for
puttin
things
off
whether
it
work
or
punishment
and
i
never
got
my
own
consent
to
this
way
o
people
with
a
hell
and
wheedlin
with
a
heaven
way
off
yonder
in
the
next
world
i
ai
as
old
as
methuselah
but
i
lived
long
enough
to
find
out
a
few
things
and
one
of
is
that
if
people
do
die
before
their
time
they
git
their
heaven
and
their
hell
right
here
in
this
world
and
whenever
i
feel
like
doubtin
the
justice
o
the
lord
i
think
o
milly
baker
boy
and
how
he
got
everything
that
belonged
to
him
and
he
did
have
to
die
and
go
to
heaven
to
git
it
either
the
mills
of
god
grind
slowly
yet
they
grind
exceeding
small
though
with
patience
he
stands
waiting
with
exactness
grinds
he
all
i
quoted
the
lines
musingly
watching
meanwhile
their
effect
on
aunt
jane
her
eyes
sparkled
as
her
quick
brain
took
in
the
meaning
of
the
poet
words
that
it
she
exclaimed
that
it
i
do
mind
waitin
myself
and
seein
other
folks
wait
too
a
reasonable
time
but
i
do
like
to
see
everybody
sooner
or
later
git
the
grist
that
rightly
belongs
to
illustration
vi
the
baptizing
at
kittle
creek
illustration
there
a
heap
o
reasons
for
folks
marryin
said
aunt
jane
reflectively
some
marries
for
love
some
for
money
some
for
a
home
some
marries
jest
to
spite
somebody
else
and
some
it
looks
like
marries
for
nothin
on
earth
but
to
have
somebody
always
around
to
quarrel
with
about
religion
that
the
way
it
was
with
marthy
and
amos
matthews
i
do
reckon
you
ever
heard
o
marthy
and
amos
did
you
child
it
been
many
a
year
since
i
thought
of
myself
but
last
sunday
evenin
i
was
over
at
elnora
simpson
and
old
uncle
sam
simpson
was
there
visitin
uncle
sam
used
to
live
in
the
neighborhood
o
goshen
but
he
moved
up
to
edmonson
county
way
back
yonder
i
tell
when
and
every
now
and
then
he
comes
back
to
see
his
grandchildren
he
gittin
well
on
towards
ninety
and
i
this
is
about
the
last
trip
the
old
man
make
till
he
goes
on
his
long
journey
i
was
mighty
glad
to
see
him
and
me
and
him
set
and
talked
about
old
times
till
the
sun
went
down
what
he
did
remember
i
did
and
what
i
did
remember
he
did
and
when
we
got
through
talkin
elnora
that
his
grandson
wife
says
uncle
sam
if
i
could
jest
take
down
everything
you
and
aunt
jane
said
i
have
a
pretty
good
history
of
everybody
that
ever
lived
in
this
county
uncle
sam
was
the
one
that
started
the
talk
about
marthy
and
amos
he
been
leanin
on
his
cane
lookin
out
o
the
door
at
twins
playin
on
the
grass
and
all
at
once
he
says
says
he
do
you
ricollect
the
time
they
had
the
big
babtizin
down
at
kittle
creek
and
he
got
to
laughin
and
i
got
to
laughin
and
we
set
there
and
cackled
like
a
pair
o
old
fools
and
nobody
but
us
two
seein
anything
funny
about
it
aunt
jane
ready
laugh
began
again
at
the
mere
remembrance
of
her
former
mirth
i
kept
discreetly
silent
fearing
to
break
the
flow
of
reminiscence
by
some
question
nobody
ever
could
see
she
continued
how
it
was
that
amos
matthews
and
marthy
crawford
ever
come
to
marry
unless
it
was
jest
as
i
said
to
have
somebody
always
handy
to
quarrel
with
about
their
religion
and
i
used
to
think
sometimes
that
marthy
and
amos
got
more
pleasure
that
way
than
most
folks
git
out
o
prayin
and
singin
and
to
preachin
amos
was
the
strictest
sort
of
a
presbyterian
and
marthy
was
a
babtist
and
to
hear
them
two
jawin
and
arguin
and
bringin
up
scripture
texts
about
predestination
and
infant
babtism
and
close
communion
and
immersion
was
enough
to
make
a
person
wish
there
was
such
a
thing
as
churches
and
doctrines
brother
rice
asked
sam
amos
once
if
marthy
and
amos
matthews
was
christians
brother
rice
had
come
to
help
parson
page
carry
on
a
meetin
and
he
was
tryin
to
find
out
who
was
the
sinners
and
who
was
the
christians
and
sam
says
my
lord
it
takes
all
o
marthy
time
to
be
a
babtist
and
all
o
amos
to
be
a
presbyterian
they
ai
got
time
to
be
christians
some
folks
wondered
how
they
ever
got
time
to
do
any
courtin
they
was
so
busy
wranglin
over
babtism
and
election
and
after
marthy
had
her
weddin
clothes
all
made
they
come
to
a
dead
stop
amos
said
he
would
feel
like
they
was
rightly
married
if
they
did
have
a
presbyterian
minister
to
marry
and
marthy
said
it
would
be
marryin
to
her
if
they
did
have
a
babtist
i
was
over
at
hannah
crawford
one
day
and
she
says
says
she
i
been
savin
up
my
eggs
and
butter
for
a
month
to
make
marthy
weddin
cake
and
if
her
and
amos
do
come
to
an
understandin
soon
it
all
be
a
dead
loss
and
marthy
says
mother
i
may
not
have
any
cake
at
my
weddin
and
i
may
not
have
any
weddin
but
one
thing
is
certain
not
goin
to
give
up
my
principles
and
hannah
sort
o
groaned
she
had
had
any
easy
time
with
miles
crawford
and
says
she
pore
foolish
child
principles
ai
the
only
thing
a
woman
has
to
give
up
when
she
gits
married
i
do
know
whether
they
ever
would
come
to
an
agreement
if
it
had
been
for
brother
morris
he
was
the
presidin
elder
from
town
and
a
powerful
hand
for
jokin
with
folks
he
happened
to
meet
amos
one
day
about
this
time
and
says
he
i
hear
you
and
miss
marthy
ca
decide
betwixt
brother
page
and
brother
gyardner
it
be
a
pity
says
he
have
a
good
match
for
such
a
little
matter
and
you
compromise
and
have
me
to
marry
you
and
amos
says
do
know
but
what
that
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
i
see
marthy
and
let
you
know
and
bless
your
life
they
was
married
a
week
from
that
day
i
went
over
and
helped
hannah
with
the
cake
and
brother
morris
said
as
pretty
a
ceremony
over
as
any
presbyterian
or
babtist
could
said
well
the
next
sunday
everybody
was
on
the
lookout
to
see
which
church
the
bride
and
groom
go
to
bush
elrod
bet
a
dollar
that
marthy
have
her
way
and
sam
amos
bet
a
dollar
that
they
be
at
the
presbyterian
church
sam
won
the
bet
and
we
was
all
right
glad
that
marthy
had
the
grace
to
give
up
that
one
time
anyhow
amos
was
powerful
pleased
havin
marthy
with
him
and
they
sung
out
of
the
same
and
looked
real
happy
it
looked
like
they
was
startin
out
right
and
i
thought
to
myself
here
a
good
beginnin
anyhow
but
it
happened
to
be
communion
sunday
and
of
all
the
unlucky
things
that
could
happened
for
marthy
and
amos
that
was
about
the
unluckiest
i
said
then
that
if
parson
page
had
been
a
woman
he
postponed
that
communion
but
a
man
could
be
expected
to
have
much
sense
about
such
matters
so
he
goes
ahead
and
gives
out
the
hymn
on
that
dark
and
dreadful
day
and
everybody
in
church
was
lookin
at
amos
and
marthy
and
watchin
to
see
what
she
was
goin
to
do
while
they
was
singin
the
hymn
the
got
up
and
went
forward
to
the
front
seats
and
amos
went
with
that
left
marthy
all
alone
in
the
pew
and
i
help
feelin
sorry
for
her
she
tried
to
look
unconcerned
but
anybody
could
see
she
felt
sort
o
forsaken
and
left
out
and
folks
all
lookin
and
some
of
whisperin
and
nudgin
each
other
i
knew
jest
exactly
how
marthy
felt
abram
said
to
me
when
we
was
on
the
way
home
that
day
if
i
been
in
amos
place
i
believe
set
still
with
marthy
marthy
come
with
him
and
it
looks
like
he
ought
to
stayed
with
her
i
reckon
though
that
amos
thought
he
was
doin
right
and
maybe
it
foolish
in
women
to
care
about
things
like
that
sam
amos
used
to
say
that
nobody
but
god
almighty
that
made
her
ever
could
tell
what
a
woman
wanted
and
what
she
want
and
i
thought
many
a
time
that
since
he
made
women
it
a
pity
he
could
made
men
with
a
better
understandin
o
ways
maybe
if
amos
set
still
that
day
things
would
been
different
with
him
and
marthy
all
their
lives
and
then
again
maybe
it
make
any
difference
it
hard
to
tell
jest
what
makes
things
go
wrong
in
this
world
and
what
makes
go
right
it
a
mighty
little
thing
for
a
man
to
git
up
and
leave
his
wife
settin
alone
in
a
pew
for
a
few
minutes
but
then
there
mighty
few
things
in
this
life
that
ai
little
till
you
git
to
follerin
up
and
seein
what
they
come
to
i
thought
of
pippa
song
say
not
a
small
event
why
costs
it
more
pain
that
this
ye
call
a
great
event
should
come
to
pass
than
that
untwine
me
from
the
mass
of
deeds
which
make
up
life
one
deed
power
shall
fall
short
in
or
exceed
and
aunt
jane
went
serenely
on
anyhow
it
was
long
till
amos
was
goin
to
his
church
and
marthy
to
hers
and
they
kept
that
up
the
rest
of
their
lives
still
they
might
got
along
well
enough
this
way
for
married
folks
do
have
to
think
alike
about
everything
but
they
was
eternally
arguin
about
their
church
doctrines
if
amos
grumbled
about
the
weather
say
everything
predestined
war
this
drought
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
what
the
sense
in
grumblin
over
the
decrees
of
god
and
it
got
so
that
if
amos
wanted
to
grumble
over
anything
he
had
to
git
away
from
home
first
and
that
must
been
mighty
wearin
on
him
for
as
a
rule
a
man
never
does
any
except
at
home
but
pore
amos
did
have
that
privilege
sam
amos
used
to
say
was
a
himself
that
there
was
some
advantages
about
bein
a
babtist
after
all
you
did
have
to
go
under
the
water
but
then
you
had
the
right
to
grumble
but
if
a
man
believed
that
everything
was
predestined
before
the
foundations
of
the
world
there
was
any
sense
or
reason
in
findin
fault
with
anything
that
happened
and
he
believed
that
he
ruther
jine
the
babtist
church
than
the
presbyterian
for
he
did
see
how
he
could
carry
on
his
farm
without
complainin
about
the
weather
and
the
crops
and
things
in
general
if
marthy
and
amos
been
divided
on
anything
but
their
churches
the
children
might
brought
together
but
every
time
a
child
was
born
matters
got
worse
amos
of
course
wanted
all
babtized
in
infancy
and
marthy
wanted
immersed
when
they
the
church
and
so
it
went
amos
had
his
way
about
the
first
one
and
i
never
shall
forgit
the
day
it
was
born
i
went
over
to
help
wait
on
marthy
and
the
baby
and
as
soon
as
i
got
the
little
thing
dressed
we
called
amos
in
to
see
it
now
amos
always
took
his
religion
mighty
hard
it
did
seem
to
bring
him
any
comfort
or
peace
o
mind
i
heard
people
say
they
did
see
how
presbyterians
ever
could
be
happy
but
la
child
it
jest
as
easy
to
be
happy
in
one
church
as
in
another
it
all
depends
on
what
doctrines
you
think
the
most
about
now
you
take
election
and
justification
and
sanctification
and
you
can
git
plenty
o
comfort
out
o
them
but
amos
never
seemed
to
think
of
anything
but
reprobation
and
eternal
damnation
them
doctrines
jest
seemed
to
weigh
on
him
night
and
day
he
used
to
say
many
a
time
that
he
did
know
whether
he
had
made
his
callin
and
election
sure
or
not
and
i
do
believe
he
thought
that
anybody
else
had
made
theirs
sure
either
abram
used
to
say
that
amos
looked
like
he
was
the
sins
o
the
world
on
his
shoulders
that
day
the
baby
was
born
i
thought
to
myself
somethin
that
make
amos
forgit
about
his
callin
and
election
for
once
anyhow
and
i
wrapped
the
little
feller
up
in
his
blanket
and
held
him
to
the
light
so
his
father
could
see
him
and
amos
looked
at
him
like
he
was
skeered
for
a
minute
and
then
he
says
lord
i
hope
it
ai
a
reprobate
now
jest
think
of
a
man
lookin
down
into
a
little
face
and
talkin
about
reprobates
marthy
heard
what
he
said
and
says
she
are
you
goin
to
have
him
babtized
in
infancy
yes
says
amos
course
i
am
and
marthy
says
had
you
better
wait
until
you
find
out
whether
he
a
reprobate
or
not
if
he
a
reprobate
babtizin
goin
to
do
him
any
good
and
if
he
elected
he
do
need
to
be
babtized
and
i
says
goodness
sake
marthy
you
and
amos
let
the
doctrines
alone
or
you
throw
yourself
into
a
fever
and
i
pushed
a
up
by
the
bed
and
i
says
amos
you
set
here
by
your
wife
and
both
of
you
thank
the
lord
for
givin
you
such
a
fine
child
and
i
laid
the
baby
in
amos
arms
and
went
out
in
the
gyarden
to
look
around
and
git
some
fresh
air
i
gethered
a
bunch
honeysuckles
to
put
on
marthy
table
and
when
i
got
back
marthy
and
the
baby
was
both
asleep
and
amos
looked
as
if
he
was
beginnin
to
have
some
little
hopes
of
the
child
salvation
marthy
named
him
john
and
sam
amos
said
he
reckoned
it
was
for
john
the
babtist
but
it
was
it
was
for
marthy
twin
brother
that
died
when
he
was
jest
three
months
old
twins
run
in
the
crawford
family
amos
had
him
babtized
in
infancy
jest
like
he
said
he
would
and
such
a
hollerin
and
squallin
never
was
heard
in
goshen
church
the
next
day
sally
ann
says
to
me
says
she
child
must
been
a
babtist
jane
for
he
did
appear
to
favor
infant
babtism
well
marthy
had
her
about
the
next
child
that
one
was
a
boy
too
and
they
named
him
amos
for
his
father
and
young
amos
babtized
in
infancy
he
was
aside
for
immersion
as
sam
amos
said
then
it
was
amos
time
to
have
his
way
and
so
they
went
on
till
young
amos
was
about
fifteen
years
old
and
marthy
got
him
converted
and
ready
to
be
immersed
the
babtists
had
a
big
meetin
that
spring
and
there
was
a
dozen
or
more
converts
to
be
babtized
when
it
was
over
we
been
havin
mighty
pleasant
weather
that
march
i
ricollect
me
and
abram
planted
our
potatoes
the
first
week
in
march
and
i
would
put
in
some
peas
abram
said
it
was
too
early
and
sure
enough
the
frost
got
when
they
was
about
two
inches
high
it
turned
off
real
cold
about
the
last
o
march
and
when
the
day
for
the
babtizin
come
there
was
a
pretty
keen
east
wind
and
kittle
creek
was
mighty
high
and
muddy
owin
to
the
rains
they
had
further
up
there
was
some
talk
o
puttin
off
the
babtizin
till
better
weather
but
brother
gyardner
he
says
colder
the
water
the
warmer
your
faith
brethren
christ
never
put
off
any
babtizin
on
account
of
the
weather
sam
amos
asked
him
if
he
did
reckon
there
was
some
difference
between
the
climate
o
kentucky
and
the
climate
o
palestine
sam
was
always
a
great
hand
to
joke
with
the
preachers
but
the
way
things
went
that
day
the
weather
did
make
much
difference
anyhow
to
young
sam
the
whole
neighborhood
turned
out
sunday
evenin
and
went
over
to
kittle
creek
to
see
the
big
babtizin
marthy
and
amos
and
all
the
children
was
there
and
marthy
looked
like
she
had
a
big
streak
good
luck
sam
amos
says
to
me
aunt
jane
marthy
waited
a
long
time
but
she
have
her
innin
now
bush
elrod
was
the
first
one
to
go
under
the
water
and
when
two
or
three
more
had
been
babtized
it
was
young
amos
time
i
saw
marthy
pushin
him
forward
and
beckonin
to
brother
gyardner
like
she
could
wait
any
longer
nobody
never
did
know
exactly
how
it
happened
some
folks
said
that
young
amos
was
overly
anxious
to
go
under
the
water
that
cold
day
and
he
kind
o
slipped
behind
his
father
when
he
saw
brother
gyardner
comin
towards
him
and
some
went
so
fur
as
to
say
that
brother
gyardner
was
in
the
habit
o
takin
a
little
spirits
after
a
to
keep
from
takin
cold
and
that
time
he
taken
it
beforehand
and
did
know
exactly
what
he
was
about
anyhow
the
first
thing
we
knew
brother
gyardner
had
hold
o
amos
himself
leadin
him
towards
the
water
amos
was
a
timid
sort
o
man
easy
flustered
and
it
looked
like
he
lost
his
wits
and
his
tongue
too
he
was
kind
o
pullin
back
and
lookin
round
in
a
skeered
way
and
brother
gyardner
he
hollered
out
right
along
brother
i
know
jest
how
it
is
myself
the
spirit
is
willin
but
the
flesh
is
weak
the
babtists
was
hallelujah
and
uncle
jim
matthews
begun
to
sing
stormy
banks
i
stand
and
pretty
near
everybody
in
till
you
could
hear
your
ears
the
rest
of
us
was
about
as
flustered
as
amos
we
knew
in
reason
that
brother
gyardner
was
makin
a
big
mistake
but
we
jest
stood
there
and
let
things
go
on
and
no
what
might
happened
if
it
had
been
for
sam
amos
sam
was
a
man
and
nothin
ever
flustered
him
as
soon
as
he
saw
how
things
was
goin
he
set
down
on
the
bank
and
pulled
off
his
boots
and
jest
as
brother
gyardner
got
into
the
middle
o
the
creek
here
come
sam
wadin
up
behind
and
grabbed
amos
by
the
shoulder
and
hollered
out
got
the
wrong
man
parson
here
amos
take
hold
me
and
he
give
amos
a
jerk
that
nearly
made
brother
gyardner
lose
his
footin
and
him
and
amos
waded
up
to
the
shore
and
left
brother
gyardner
standin
there
in
the
middle
o
the
creek
lookin
like
lost
his
job
well
that
put
a
stop
to
the
singin
and
the
shoutin
and
the
way
folks
laughed
was
scandalous
they
had
to
walk
amos
home
in
a
hurry
to
git
his
wet
clothes
off
and
uncle
jim
matthews
and
old
man
bob
crawford
went
with
him
to
rub
him
down
amos
was
subject
to
bronchitis
anyhow
marthy
went
on
ahead
of
in
the
wagon
to
have
hot
water
and
blankets
ready
i
give
marthy
that
credit
she
appeared
to
forgit
all
about
the
babtizin
when
amos
come
up
so
wet
and
shiverin
sam
could
git
his
boots
on
over
his
wet
socks
and
as
he
walked
over
to
the
creek
silas
petty
had
to
take
him
home
in
his
spring
wagon
brother
gyardner
all
this
time
was
lookin
round
for
young
amos
but
he
was
to
be
found
high
nor
low
and
that
set
folks
to
laughin
again
and
so
many
havin
to
leave
the
babtizin
was
clean
broke
up
milly
come
up
jest
as
sam
was
gittin
into
old
man
bob
wagon
and
says
she
sam
you
ruined
your
sunday
pants
this
time
and
sam
says
nothin
the
rest
o
you
all
can
save
your
sunday
pants
if
you
want
to
but
this
here
a
free
country
and
i
ai
goin
to
stand
by
and
see
a
man
babtized
against
his
will
while
i
able
to
save
him
and
if
sam
saved
amos
life
instead
jest
savin
him
from
babtism
amos
could
been
gratefuler
when
sam
broke
his
arm
the
follerin
summer
amos
went
over
and
set
up
with
him
at
night
and
let
his
own
wheat
stand
while
he
harvested
sam
well
the
next
time
the
met
the
babtists
had
new
to
talk
about
old
brother
gyardner
got
up
and
says
he
there
a
question
that
been
botherin
me
for
some
time
and
i
like
to
hear
it
discussed
and
git
it
settled
if
possible
and
says
he
a
man
should
be
babtized
accidentally
and
against
his
will
would
he
be
a
babtist
or
would
he
not
and
they
begun
to
argue
it
and
they
had
it
up
and
down
and
some
was
of
one
opinion
and
some
of
another
brother
gyardner
said
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
babtism
made
a
man
a
babtist
but
old
brother
bascom
said
if
a
man
was
a
babtist
in
his
heart
all
the
water
in
the
sea
would
make
him
one
and
brother
gyardner
said
that
was
knockin
the
props
clean
from
under
the
babtist
faith
says
he
bein
a
babtist
in
the
heart
makes
a
man
a
babtist
then
babtism
ai
necessary
to
salvation
and
if
babtism
ai
necessary
what
becomes
o
the
babtist
church
somebody
told
amos
about
the
dispute
they
was
havin
over
his
case
and
amos
says
them
fool
babtists
want
that
question
settled
let
come
to
me
says
he
father
and
mother
was
presbyterians
and
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
and
on
both
sides
i
was
sprinkled
in
infancy
and
i
the
presbyterian
church
as
soon
as
i
come
to
the
age
of
accountability
and
if
you
was
to
carry
me
over
to
jerusalem
and
babtize
me
in
the
river
jordan
itself
i
still
be
a
presbyterian
here
aunt
jane
paused
to
laugh
again
there
some
things
child
she
said
as
she
wiped
her
glasses
that
people
laugh
over
and
then
forgit
and
there
some
things
they
never
git
over
about
the
kittle
creek
babtizin
was
one
o
that
kind
old
man
bob
crawford
used
to
say
he
would
took
five
hundred
dollars
for
that
babtizin
old
man
bob
was
the
biggest
laugher
in
the
country
you
could
hear
him
for
pretty
near
half
a
mile
when
he
got
in
a
laughin
way
and
he
used
to
say
that
whenever
he
felt
like
havin
a
good
laugh
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
think
of
amos
and
how
he
looked
with
brother
gyardner
leadin
him
into
the
water
and
the
babtists
over
him
bush
elrod
was
another
one
that
never
got
over
it
every
time
he
see
amos
he
begin
to
sing
jordan
stormy
banks
i
stand
and
amos
could
git
out
o
the
way
quick
enough
well
that
what
made
me
and
old
uncle
sam
simpson
laugh
so
last
sunday
i
do
reckon
there
anything
funny
in
it
to
folks
that
never
seen
it
but
when
old
people
git
together
and
call
up
old
times
they
can
see
jest
how
folks
looked
and
acted
and
it
like
livin
it
all
over
again
i
do
believe
you
can
see
it
any
plainer
than
i
do
aunt
jane
i
hastened
to
assure
her
it
is
all
as
clear
to
me
as
any
picture
i
ever
saw
it
was
in
march
you
say
and
the
wind
was
cool
but
the
sun
was
warm
and
if
you
sat
in
a
sheltered
place
you
might
almost
think
it
was
the
last
of
april
that
so
child
i
remember
me
and
abram
set
under
the
bank
on
a
rock
that
kind
o
cut
off
the
north
wind
and
it
was
real
pleasant
then
there
must
have
been
a
purple
haze
on
the
hills
and
while
the
trees
were
still
bare
there
was
a
look
about
them
as
if
the
coming
leaves
were
casting
their
shadows
before
there
were
heaps
of
brown
leaves
from
last
year
autumn
in
the
fence
corners
and
as
you
and
uncle
abram
walked
home
you
looked
under
them
to
see
if
the
violets
were
coming
up
and
found
some
tiny
wood
ferns
aunt
jane
dropped
her
knitting
and
leaned
back
in
the
high
chair
why
child
she
said
in
an
tone
are
you
a
not
at
all
aunt
jane
i
said
laughing
at
the
dear
old
consternation
i
am
only
a
good
guesser
and
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
not
only
see
the
things
that
you
see
and
tell
me
but
some
of
the
things
that
you
see
and
do
tell
me
did
marthy
ever
get
young
amos
baptized
i
asked
la
yes
laughed
aunt
jane
they
finished
up
the
babtizin
two
weeks
after
that
it
was
a
nice
pleasant
day
and
young
amos
went
under
the
water
all
right
but
mighty
little
good
it
did
him
after
all
for
as
soon
as
he
come
of
age
he
married
matildy
harris
matildy
was
a
methodist
and
he
got
to
goin
to
church
with
his
wife
and
that
was
the
last
of
his
babtist
raisin
then
we
both
were
silent
for
a
while
and
i
watched
the
gathering
in
the
west
a
low
rumble
of
thunder
broke
the
stillness
of
the
august
afternoon
aunt
jane
looked
up
apprehensively
there
goin
to
be
a
storm
betwixt
now
and
sundown
she
said
but
i
reckon
them
young
turkeys
be
safe
under
their
mother
wings
by
that
time
do
you
think
a
wife
ought
to
join
her
husband
church
aunt
jane
i
asked
with
idle
irrelevance
to
her
remark
sometimes
she
ought
and
sometimes
she
ought
replied
aunt
jane
oracularly
there
ai
any
rule
about
it
everybody
got
to
be
their
own
judge
about
such
matters
if
i
been
in
marthy
place
i
would
amos
church
and
if
i
been
in
amos
place
i
would
marthy
church
so
there
it
is
but
did
you
join
uncle
abram
church
i
asked
in
a
laudable
endeavor
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
yes
i
did
said
aunt
jane
stoutly
but
that
a
mighty
different
thing
of
course
i
went
with
abram
and
if
i
had
it
to
do
over
again
i
do
it
you
see
the
way
of
it
was
this
my
folks
was
campbellites
or
christians
they
ruther
be
called
it
curious
how
they
like
to
be
called
campbellites
methodists
do
mind
bein
called
wesleyans
and
presbyterians
do
git
mad
if
you
call
calvinists
and
i
reckon
alexander
campbell
was
jest
as
good
a
man
as
wesley
and
a
sight
calvin
but
you
ca
make
a
campbellite
madder
than
to
call
him
a
campbellite
however
as
i
was
sayin
alexander
campbell
himself
babtized
my
father
and
mother
out
here
in
drake
creek
and
i
was
brought
up
to
think
that
my
church
was
christian
church
sure
enough
but
when
me
and
abram
married
neither
one
of
us
was
thinkin
much
about
churches
i
used
to
tell
marthy
that
if
a
come
talkin
church
to
me
when
he
ought
to
been
courtin
me
i
told
him
to
go
on
and
marry
a
or
a
catechism
i
believe
in
religion
jest
as
much
as
anybody
but
a
man
that
ca
forgit
his
religion
while
he
courtin
a
woman
ai
worth
havin
that
my
opinion
but
as
i
was
sayin
me
and
abram
had
the
church
question
to
settle
after
we
was
married
and
i
do
believe
either
one
of
us
thought
about
it
till
sunday
mornin
come
i
ricollect
it
jest
like
it
was
yesterday
we
was
married
in
june
and
you
know
how
things
always
look
about
then
i
thought
many
a
day
when
i
been
out
in
the
gyarden
workin
with
my
vegetables
and
getherin
my
honeysuckles
and
roses
that
if
folks
could
jest
live
on
and
never
git
old
and
stay
june
forever
that
this
world
be
heaven
enough
for
anybody
and
that
the
way
it
was
that
sunday
mornin
i
ricollect
i
had
on
my
dress
the
prettiest
sort
of
a
changeable
silk
kind
dove
color
and
pink
and
i
had
a
leghorn
bonnet
on
with
pink
roses
inside
the
brim
and
black
lace
mitts
on
my
hands
i
stood
up
before
the
glass
jest
before
i
went
out
to
the
gate
where
abram
was
for
me
and
i
looked
as
pretty
as
a
pink
if
i
do
say
it
goes
but
a
little
ways
my
mother
used
to
tell
me
when
i
was
a
gyirl
but
i
reckon
there
ai
any
harm
in
an
old
woman
like
me
tellin
how
she
looked
when
she
was
a
bride
sixty
years
ago
and
a
faint
color
came
into
the
wrinkled
cheeks
while
her
clear
high
laugh
rang
out
the
outward
symbols
of
youth
and
beauty
were
gone
but
their
unquenchable
spirit
lay
warm
under
the
ashes
of
nearly
eight
decades
well
i
went
out
and
abram
helped
me
into
the
buggy
and
instead
goin
straight
on
to
goshen
church
he
turned
around
and
drove
out
to
my
church
when
we
walked
in
i
could
see
folks
nudgin
each
other
and
laughin
and
when
meetin
broke
and
we
was
fixin
to
go
home
aunt
maria
taylor
grabbed
hold
o
me
and
pulled
me
off
to
one
side
and
says
she
right
jane
you
beginnin
in
time
jest
break
a
man
in
at
the
start
and
you
wo
have
no
trouble
afterwards
and
i
jest
laughed
in
her
face
and
went
on
to
where
abram
was
waitin
for
me
i
was
too
happy
to
git
mad
that
day
well
the
next
sunday
when
we
got
into
the
buggy
and
abram
started
to
turn
round
i
took
hold
o
the
reins
and
says
i
my
time
to
drive
abram
you
had
your
way
last
sunday
and
now
i
goin
to
have
mine
and
i
snapped
the
whip
over
old
nell
back
and
drove
right
on
to
goshen
and
abram
jest
set
back
and
laughed
fit
to
kill
we
went
on
that
way
for
two
or
three
months
folks
sayin
that
abram
and
jane
parrish
could
go
to
the
same
church
two
sundays
straight
along
to
save
their
lives
and
everybody
wonderin
which
of
us
have
their
way
in
the
long
run
and
me
and
abram
jest
laughed
in
our
sleeves
and
paid
no
attention
to
for
there
never
was
but
one
way
for
us
anyhow
and
that
was
abram
way
nor
my
way
it
was
jest
way
there
lots
of
married
folks
honey
and
one
of
here
and
one
of
gone
over
yonder
and
there
a
long
deep
grave
between
but
they
a
heap
nearer
to
each
other
than
two
people
that
stay
in
the
same
house
and
eat
at
the
same
table
and
sleep
in
the
same
bed
and
all
the
time
there
two
great
thick
church
walls
between
and
growin
thicker
and
higher
every
day
sam
amos
used
to
say
that
if
religion
made
folks
act
like
marthy
and
amos
did
he
believed
he
ruther
have
less
religion
or
none
at
all
but
honey
when
you
see
married
folks
quarrelin
over
their
churches
it
too
much
religion
that
the
cause
o
the
trouble
it
too
little
love
jest
ricollect
that
if
folks
love
each
other
right
religion
ai
goin
to
come
between
well
as
soon
as
cold
weather
set
in
they
started
up
a
big
revival
at
goshen
church
after
the
meetin
had
been
goin
on
for
three
or
four
weeks
parson
page
give
out
one
sunday
that
the
session
would
meet
on
the
follerin
thursday
to
examine
all
that
had
experienced
a
change
heart
and
wanted
to
unite
with
the
church
i
never
said
a
word
to
abram
but
thursday
evenin
while
he
was
out
on
the
farm
mendin
some
fences
that
the
cattle
had
broke
down
i
harnessed
old
nell
to
the
buggy
and
drove
out
to
goshen
all
the
converts
was
there
and
the
session
was
questionin
and
examinin
when
i
got
in
when
it
come
my
turn
parson
page
begun
askin
me
if
i
made
my
callin
and
election
sure
and
i
come
right
out
and
says
i
do
know
much
about
callin
and
election
brother
page
i
reckon
i
a
christian
says
i
i
been
tryin
to
do
right
by
everybody
ever
since
i
was
old
enough
to
know
the
difference
betwixt
right
and
wrong
but
if
the
plain
truth
was
told
i
this
church
jest
because
abram
church
and
i
want
to
please
him
and
that
all
the
testimony
i
got
to
give
and
parson
page
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
to
keep
from
laughin
he
was
a
young
man
then
and
had
been
married
long
himself
and
says
he
do
sister
parrish
brethren
pass
on
to
the
next
candidate
i
left
examinin
sam
crawford
about
his
callin
and
election
and
i
got
home
before
abram
come
to
the
house
and
the
next
day
when
i
walked
up
with
the
rest
of
abram
was
the
only
person
in
the
church
that
was
surprised
when
they
got
through
givin
us
the
right
hand
o
fellowship
and
i
went
back
to
our
pew
abram
took
hold
o
my
hand
and
held
on
to
it
like
he
never
would
let
go
and
i
knew
i
done
the
right
thing
and
i
never
would
regret
it
there
was
a
light
on
the
old
woman
face
that
made
me
turn
my
eyes
away
here
was
a
personal
revelation
that
should
have
satisfied
the
most
exacting
but
my
vulgar
curiosity
cried
out
for
further
light
on
the
past
what
would
you
have
done
i
asked
if
uncle
abram
had
turned
the
horse
that
sunday
morning
if
he
had
gone
straight
on
to
goshen
aunt
jane
regarded
me
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
pitying
allowance
such
as
one
bestows
on
a
child
who
does
know
any
better
than
to
ask
stupid
questions
shuh
child
she
said
with
careless
brevity
abram
could
done
such
a
thing
as
that
illustration
vii
how
sam
amos
rode
in
the
tournament
illustration
there
one
thing
i
like
mighty
well
to
see
again
before
i
die
said
aunt
jane
and
that
is
a
good
fair
the
apostle
says
we
must
forward
forgetting
the
things
that
are
behind
but
there
some
things
i
left
behind
that
i
ca
never
forget
and
the
fairs
we
had
in
my
day
is
one
of
it
was
the
quietest
hour
of
an
august
afternoon
that
time
when
one
seems
to
have
reached
the
land
where
it
is
always
afternoon
and
aunt
jane
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
back
porch
shelling
for
the
next
day
market
before
us
lay
the
garden
in
the
splendid
fulness
of
late
summer
concord
and
catawba
grapes
loaded
the
vines
on
the
rickety
old
arbor
tomatoes
were
ripening
in
reckless
plenty
to
be
given
to
the
neighbors
or
to
lie
in
tempting
rows
on
the
of
the
kitchen
and
the
shelves
of
the
back
porch
the
second
planting
of
cucumber
vines
ran
in
flowery
luxuriance
over
the
space
allotted
to
them
and
even
encroached
on
the
territory
of
the
squashes
and
melons
damsons
hung
purpling
over
the
eaves
of
the
house
and
wasps
and
bees
kept
up
a
lively
buzzing
as
they
feasted
on
the
windfalls
of
the
old
yellow
peach
tree
near
the
garden
gate
nature
had
distributed
her
sunshine
and
showers
with
wise
generosity
that
year
and
neither
in
field
nor
in
garden
was
there
lack
of
any
good
thing
perhaps
it
was
this
gracious
abundance
presaging
fine
exhibits
at
the
coming
fair
that
turned
aunt
jane
thoughts
towards
the
fairs
of
her
youth
folks
nowadays
do
seem
to
think
much
about
fairs
she
continued
but
when
i
was
young
a
fair
was
something
that
the
grown
folks
looked
forward
to
jest
like
children
look
for
christmas
the
women
and
the
men
too
was
gittin
ready
for
the
fair
all
the
year
round
the
women
piecin
quilts
and
knittin
socks
and
weavin
carpets
and
puttin
up
preserves
and
pickles
and
the
men
raisin
fine
stock
and
when
the
fair
come
it
was
worth
goin
to
child
and
worth
rememberin
after
you
gone
to
it
i
hear
folks
talkin
about
the
fair
every
year
and
i
laugh
to
myself
and
i
say
folks
do
know
what
a
fair
is
and
i
set
out
there
on
my
porch
fair
week
and
watch
the
buggies
and
wagons
goin
by
in
the
mornin
and
comin
home
at
night
and
i
git
right
happy
about
the
time
when
me
and
abram
and
the
children
used
to
go
over
the
same
road
to
the
fair
but
a
mighty
different
sort
of
fair
from
what
they
have
nowadays
one
thing
is
honey
they
have
the
fairs
too
soon
it
never
was
intended
for
folks
to
go
to
fairs
in
hot
weather
and
here
they
got
to
havin
the
first
week
in
september
about
the
hottest
driest
dustiest
time
of
the
whole
year
nothin
looks
pretty
then
and
it
always
makes
me
think
o
folks
when
they
been
their
summer
clothes
for
three
months
and
everything
all
faded
and
dusty
and
drabbled
that
the
way
it
generally
is
in
september
but
jest
wait
till
two
or
three
good
rains
come
and
everything
washed
clean
and
sweet
and
the
trees
look
like
they
got
a
new
set
leaves
and
the
grass
comes
out
green
and
fresh
like
it
does
in
the
spring
and
the
nights
and
the
mornin
feel
cool
though
it
hot
enough
in
the
middle
o
the
day
and
maybe
there
come
a
touch
of
early
frost
jest
enough
to
turn
the
top
leaves
on
the
sugar
maples
that
october
child
and
that
the
time
for
a
fair
lord
the
good
times
i
seen
in
them
days
startin
early
and
comin
home
late
with
the
sun
settin
in
front
of
you
and
by
and
by
the
moon
comin
up
behind
you
and
the
wind
blowin
cool
out
o
the
woods
on
the
side
o
the
road
the
baby
fast
asleep
in
my
arms
and
the
other
children
talkin
with
each
other
about
what
they
seen
and
abram
drivin
slow
over
the
rough
places
and
lookin
back
every
once
in
a
while
to
see
if
we
was
all
there
it
a
curious
thing
honey
i
liked
fairs
as
well
as
anybody
and
i
reckon
i
saw
all
there
was
to
be
seen
and
heard
everything
there
was
to
be
heard
every
time
i
went
to
one
but
now
when
i
git
to
callin
up
it
appears
to
me
that
the
best
part
of
it
all
and
the
part
i
ricollect
the
plainest
was
jest
the
goin
there
and
the
comin
back
home
abram
knew
i
liked
to
stay
till
everything
was
over
and
he
git
somebody
to
water
and
feed
the
stock
and
then
i
never
had
any
hot
suppers
to
git
while
the
fair
lasted
so
there
was
anything
to
hurry
me
and
abram
i
ricollect
maria
petty
come
up
one
day
about
five
jest
as
we
was
lookin
at
the
last
race
and
says
she
about
to
drop
jane
but
i
believe
i
ruther
stay
here
and
sleep
on
the
floor
o
the
than
to
go
home
and
cook
a
hot
supper
and
i
says
cook
a
hot
supper
then
and
says
she
silas
would
eat
a
piece
o
cold
bread
at
home
to
save
his
life
or
mine
either
there
a
heap
o
women
to
be
pitied
child
said
aunt
jane
dropping
a
handful
of
shelled
beans
into
my
pan
with
a
cheerful
clatter
but
of
all
things
deliver
me
from
livin
with
a
man
that
has
to
have
hot
bread
three
times
a
day
milly
amos
used
to
say
that
when
she
died
she
wanted
a
hot
biscuit
carved
on
her
tombstone
and
that
if
it
was
for
hot
biscuits
there
be
a
mighty
small
crop
of
widowers
sam
you
see
was
another
man
that
could
eat
cold
bread
but
sam
had
a
right
to
his
hot
biscuits
for
if
milly
did
feel
like
goin
into
the
kitchen
sam
go
out
and
mix
up
his
biscuits
and
bake
himself
sam
soda
biscuits
was
as
good
as
mine
and
when
it
come
to
beaten
biscuits
why
nobody
could
equal
sam
milly
make
up
the
dough
as
stiff
as
she
could
handle
it
and
sam
beat
it
till
it
was
soft
enough
to
roll
out
and
such
biscuits
i
never
expect
to
eat
again
white
and
light
as
snow
inside
and
crisp
as
a
cracker
outside
folks
nowadays
makes
beaten
biscuits
by
machinery
but
they
do
taste
like
the
kind
that
was
beat
by
hand
and
talkin
about
biscuits
child
reminds
me
of
the
cookin
i
used
to
do
for
the
fairs
i
do
reckon
many
women
likes
to
remember
the
cookin
they
done
when
folks
git
to
rememberin
it
looks
like
the
only
thing
they
want
to
call
up
is
the
pleasure
they
had
the
picnics
and
the
weddin
and
the
but
somehow
the
work
i
done
in
my
day
is
jest
as
precious
to
me
as
the
play
i
had
i
hear
young
folks
complainin
about
havin
to
work
so
hard
and
i
say
to
when
you
git
to
be
as
old
as
i
am
and
ca
work
all
you
want
to
you
know
there
ai
any
pleasure
like
good
hard
work
there
one
thing
that
bothers
me
child
and
aunt
jane
voice
sank
to
a
confidential
key
i
had
a
plenty
o
fears
in
my
life
but
they
all
passed
over
me
and
now
there
jest
one
thing
i
afraid
of
that
i
live
to
be
too
old
to
work
it
appears
to
me
like
i
could
stand
anything
but
that
and
if
the
time
ever
comes
when
i
help
myself
nor
other
folks
either
i
trust
the
lord
see
fit
to
call
me
hence
and
give
me
a
new
body
and
start
me
to
work
again
right
away
but
as
i
was
sayin
i
always
enjoyed
cookin
and
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
set
and
think
about
the
hams
i
and
the
bread
i
baked
and
the
and
and
all
the
rest
o
the
things
i
used
to
take
to
the
fair
abram
was
always
mighty
proud
o
my
cookin
and
we
generally
had
a
half
a
dozen
or
more
o
the
town
folks
to
eat
dinner
with
us
every
day
o
the
fair
old
judge
grace
and
brigham
never
failed
to
eat
with
us
the
old
judge
say
something
about
my
bread
every
time
i
meet
him
in
town
the
first
year
my
bread
took
the
premium
abram
sent
the
premium
loaf
to
him
with
the
blue
ribbon
tied
around
it
after
abram
died
i
stopped
goin
to
the
fairs
and
i
do
know
how
many
years
it
been
since
i
set
foot
on
the
grounds
i
had
an
idea
how
things
changed
since
my
day
till
year
before
last
henrietta
and
her
husband
come
down
here
from
danville
he
come
to
show
some
blooded
stock
and
she
come
along
with
him
to
see
me
and
says
she
you
got
to
go
to
the
fair
with
me
one
day
anyhow
and
i
went
more
to
please
her
than
to
please
myself
i
always
contendin
child
that
this
world
growin
better
and
better
all
the
time
but
lord
lord
that
fair
come
pretty
near
upsettin
my
faith
why
in
my
day
folks
could
take
their
children
to
the
fair
and
turn
loose
and
if
they
had
sense
enough
to
keep
from
under
the
horses
feet
they
was
jest
as
safe
at
the
fair
as
they
was
at
a
may
meetin
but
la
the
sights
i
saw
that
day
henrietta
took
me
to
the
fair
every
which
way
you
look
there
was
some
sort
of
a
trap
for
temptin
boys
and
leadin
astray
whisky
and
beer
and
all
sorts
o
gamblin
machines
and
pool
sellin
and
little
boys
no
that
smokin
little
white
cigyars
and
offerin
to
bet
with
each
other
on
the
races
and
i
says
to
henrietta
i
do
call
this
a
fair
why
it
jest
nothin
but
a
gamblin
den
and
a
whisky
saloon
and
says
i
know
now
what
old
uncle
henry
matthews
meant
i
asked
the
old
man
if
he
was
goin
to
show
anything
at
the
fair
that
year
and
he
said
jane
unless
you
got
for
the
town
folks
to
bet
on
it
ai
worth
while
but
there
was
one
thing
i
did
enjoy
that
day
and
that
was
the
races
there
some
folks
thinks
that
racin
horses
is
a
terrible
sin
but
i
do
it
the
bettin
and
the
swearin
that
goes
with
the
that
the
sin
if
folks
behave
as
well
as
the
horses
behaves
a
race
be
jest
as
religious
as
a
picnic
there
ai
a
finer
sight
to
me
than
a
blooded
horse
goin
at
a
gait
round
a
smooth
track
and
the
sun
and
the
flags
and
the
wind
blowin
and
the
folks
cheerin
and
hollerin
so
when
henrietta
said
the
races
was
goin
to
begin
i
says
says
i
child
take
hold
o
my
arm
and
help
me
down
these
steps
i
goin
to
see
one
more
race
before
i
die
and
henrietta
helped
me
down
and
we
went
over
to
the
grand
stand
and
got
a
good
seat
where
i
could
see
the
horses
when
they
come
to
the
finish
i
tell
you
honey
it
made
me
feel
young
again
jest
to
see
them
horses
coverin
the
ground
like
they
did
my
father
used
to
raise
fine
horses
and
abram
used
to
say
that
when
it
come
to
knowin
a
horse
he
back
me
against
any
man
in
kentucky
i
have
to
be
a
heap
i
am
now
before
i
see
the
day
when
i
would
turn
around
and
walk
a
good
piece
to
look
at
a
fine
horse
and
the
old
lady
gave
a
laugh
at
this
confession
of
weakness
it
was
like
old
times
to
see
the
way
them
horses
run
and
when
they
come
to
the
finish
i
was
laughin
and
hollerin
as
much
as
anybody
and
jest
then
somebody
right
behind
me
give
a
yell
and
says
he
for
old
kentucky
when
it
comes
to
fine
horses
and
fine
whisky
and
fine
women
she
ca
be
beat
everybody
begun
to
laugh
and
a
man
right
in
front
o
me
says
that
young
feller
from
his
father
one
o
the
biggest
horsemen
in
the
state
that
his
horse
that
jest
won
the
race
and
i
turned
around
to
see
and
there
was
a
boy
about
the
size
o
my
youngest
grandchild
up
at
danville
his
hat
was
set
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
hair
was
combed
down
over
his
eyes
till
he
looked
like
he
come
out
of
a
school
he
had
a
little
white
cigyar
in
his
mouth
and
you
could
tell
by
his
breath
that
he
been
drinkin
now
i
ai
much
of
a
hand
for
meddlin
with
other
folks
business
but
i
been
readin
about
the
salvation
army
and
how
they
preach
on
the
street
and
it
come
into
my
head
that
here
was
a
time
for
some
salvation
work
and
i
says
to
him
says
i
there
another
thing
that
kentucky
used
to
be
hard
to
beat
on
and
that
was
fine
men
but
says
i
the
fine
horses
and
the
fine
women
and
the
fine
whisky
some
o
the
men
has
got
to
be
a
mighty
common
lot
says
i
as
much
as
you
please
for
that
horse
out
there
he
worth
hollerin
for
but
says
i
a
state
got
to
raisin
a
better
breed
o
horses
than
she
raises
men
it
ai
no
time
to
be
hurrah
for
her
says
i
your
father
son
and
your
father
horse
now
which
do
you
reckon
your
father
proudest
of
his
horse
or
his
son
well
folks
begun
to
laugh
again
and
the
boy
looked
like
he
wanted
to
say
somethin
sassy
but
he
could
git
his
wits
together
enough
to
think
up
anything
and
i
says
says
i
horse
never
touched
whisky
or
tobacco
in
his
life
he
and
and
he
live
to
a
good
old
age
and
maybe
when
he
dies
they
bury
him
like
a
christian
and
put
a
monument
up
over
him
like
they
did
over
ten
broeck
but
you
why
you
ai
hardly
out
o
your
short
pants
and
you
fifty
years
old
if
you
a
day
you
bring
your
father
gray
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
and
you
go
to
your
own
grave
a
heap
you
ought
to
and
nobody
ever
build
a
monument
over
you
there
was
three
or
four
boys
along
with
the
boy
and
one
of
that
appeared
to
have
less
whisky
in
him
than
the
rest
he
says
grandma
i
reckon
you
about
right
we
a
pretty
bad
lot
and
says
he
on
boys
and
let
git
out
o
this
and
off
they
went
and
whether
my
preachin
ever
did
any
good
i
do
know
but
i
could
help
sayin
what
i
did
and
that
the
last
time
i
ever
went
to
these
fairs
they
havin
nowadays
fair
time
used
to
mean
a
heap
to
me
but
now
it
do
mean
anything
but
jest
to
put
me
in
mind
o
old
times
just
then
there
was
a
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
on
the
pike
and
loud
whoas
from
a
rider
in
distress
we
started
up
with
the
eagerness
of
those
whose
lives
have
flowed
too
long
in
the
channels
of
stillness
and
peace
here
was
a
possibility
of
adventure
not
to
be
lost
for
any
consideration
aunt
jane
dropped
her
pan
with
a
sharp
clang
i
gathered
up
my
skirt
with
its
measure
of
unshelled
beans
and
together
we
rushed
to
the
front
of
the
house
it
was
a
solitary
horseman
wholly
and
ludicrously
at
the
mercy
of
his
steed
a
mischievous
young
horse
that
had
never
felt
the
bridle
and
bit
of
a
trainer
it
that
boy
of
joe
crofton
chuckled
aunt
jane
nobody
ever
think
he
was
born
in
kentucky
now
would
they
old
man
bob
crawford
used
to
say
that
every
country
boy
in
this
state
was
a
sort
o
to
a
horse
but
that
boy
yonder
ai
no
kin
to
the
filly
he
tryin
to
ride
there
good
blood
in
that
filly
as
sure
you
born
i
can
tell
by
the
way
she
throws
her
head
and
uses
her
feet
she
make
a
fine
if
her
master
ever
gets
hold
of
her
jest
look
yonder
will
you
the
horse
had
come
to
a
stand
she
gave
a
sudden
backward
leap
raised
herself
on
her
hind
legs
came
down
on
all
fours
with
a
great
clatter
of
hoofs
and
began
a
circular
dance
over
the
smooth
road
round
she
went
stepping
as
daintily
as
a
maiden
at
a
dance
while
the
rider
clung
to
the
reins
dug
his
bare
heels
into
the
glossy
sides
of
his
steed
and
yelled
whoa
as
if
his
salvation
lay
in
that
word
then
as
if
just
awakened
to
a
sense
of
duty
the
filly
ceased
her
antics
tossed
her
head
with
a
determined
air
and
broke
into
a
brisk
clean
gallop
that
would
have
delighted
a
skilled
rider
but
seemed
to
bring
only
fresh
dismay
to
the
soul
of
joe
crofton
boy
his
arms
flapped
dismally
and
hopelessly
up
and
down
a
gust
of
wind
seized
his
ragged
cap
and
tossed
it
impishly
on
one
of
the
topmost
boughs
of
the
hedge
his
protesting
whoa
voiced
the
hopelessness
of
one
who
resigns
himself
to
the
power
of
a
dire
fate
and
he
disappeared
ingloriously
in
a
cloud
of
summer
dust
whereupon
we
returned
to
the
prosaic
work
of
with
the
feeling
of
those
who
have
watched
the
curtain
go
down
on
the
last
scene
of
the
comedy
i
declare
to
goodness
sighed
aunt
jane
breathlessly
as
she
stooped
to
recover
her
pan
i
ai
laughed
so
much
in
i
do
know
when
it
reminds
me
o
the
time
sam
amos
rode
in
the
and
she
began
laughing
again
at
some
recollection
in
which
i
had
no
part
now
that
right
curious
ai
it
when
i
set
here
talkin
about
fairs
that
boy
comes
by
and
makes
me
think
o
how
sam
rode
at
the
fair
that
year
they
had
the
i
do
know
how
long
been
since
i
thought
o
that
ride
and
maybe
i
never
would
thought
of
it
again
if
that
boy
of
joe
crofton
had
put
me
in
mind
of
it
i
dropped
my
for
a
moment
and
assumed
a
listening
attitude
and
without
any
further
solicitation
and
in
the
natural
course
of
events
the
story
began
you
see
the
town
folks
was
always
gittin
up
somethin
new
for
the
fair
and
that
year
i
talkin
about
it
was
a
all
the
goshen
folks
that
went
to
town
the
last
county
court
day
before
the
fair
come
back
with
the
news
that
there
was
goin
to
be
a
the
third
day
o
the
fair
everybody
was
sayin
that
and
nobody
could
answer
till
sam
crawford
went
to
town
one
saturday
jest
before
the
fair
and
come
back
with
the
whole
thing
at
his
tongue
end
sam
heard
that
they
was
practisin
for
the
that
evenin
and
as
he
passed
the
fair
grounds
on
his
way
home
he
made
a
of
goin
in
and
seein
what
they
was
about
he
said
there
was
twelve
young
men
and
they
was
called
knights
and
they
had
a
lot
o
iron
rings
hung
from
the
posts
of
the
and
they
tear
around
the
ring
like
mad
and
try
to
stick
a
pole
through
every
ring
and
carry
it
off
with
and
the
one
that
got
the
most
rings
got
the
blue
ribbon
sam
said
it
took
a
good
eye
and
a
steady
arm
and
a
good
seat
to
manage
the
thing
and
he
enjoyed
watchin
says
he
they
call
the
thing
a
is
i
could
make
out
i
stayed
there
a
plumb
hour
and
i
could
hear
nor
see
anything
that
sounded
or
looked
like
a
tune

the
third
day
o
the
fair

we
was
all
on

with
gold
and
silver
spangles

they
galloped
around
and
tried
to
take
off
the
rings
on
their
long
poles
when
they
got
through
with
that
the
knights
they
rode
up
to
the
judges
with
a
wreath
o
flowers
on
the
ends
o
their
poles

called
and
every
knight
called
out
the
name
o
the
lady
that
he
thought
the
most
of
and
she
come
up
to
the
stand
and
they
put
the
wreath
on
her
head
and
there

twelve
pretty
gyirls

at
once
the
band
struck
up
and
sam
horse
broke
into
a
gallop

his
head
and
took
a
firm
seat
and
seemed
to
enjoy
it
as
much
as
anybody
but
after
he
galloped
around
the
ring
two
or
three
times
he
tried
to
rein
the
horse
in
and
get
him
down
to
a
nice
steady
trot
like
the
simpson
man
was
doin
but
no
sir
that
horse
had
any
idea
of
stoppin
the
harder
the
band
played
the
faster
he
galloped
and
uncle
jim
matthews
says
reckon
sam
horse
thinks
it
another
and
abram
says
like
he
been
paid
to
gallop
jest
that
way
do
he
uncle
jim
but
horses
has
a
heap
o
sense
child
and
it
looked
to
me
like
the
horse
knew
he
had
sam
amos
one
o
the
best
riders
in
the
county
on
his
back
and
he
was
jest
playin
a
little
joke
on
him
well
of
course
when
the
judges
seen
that
sam
lost
control
of
his
horse
they
called
the
simpson
man
up
and
tied
the
blue
ribbon
on
him
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
waved
it
around
and
then
he
trotted
around
the
ring
and
the
simpson
folks
hollered
and
threw
up
their
hats
and
all
that
time
sam
horse
was
tearin
around
the
ring
jest
as
hard
as
he
could
go
sam
hat
was
off
and
i
ricollect
jest
how
his
hair
looked
blowin
back
in
the
wind
milly
had
trimmed
it
for
some
time
and
him
gittin
madder
and
madder
every
minute
of
course

mad
too
because
sam
did
git
the
blue
ribbon
but
we
had
to
laugh
and
the
town
folks
and
the
simpson
folks
they
looked
like
they
split
their
sides
old
man
bob
crawford
jest
laid
back
on
the
benches
and
hollered
and
laughed
till
he
got
right
purple
in
the
face
and
says
he
beats
the
kittle
creek
babtizin
all
to
pieces
well
nobody
knows
how
long
that
horse
would
kept
on
gallopin
for
sam
could
stop
him
but
finally
two
o
the
judges
they
stepped
out
and
headed
him
off
and
took
hold
o
the
bridle
and
led
him
out
the
ring
and
uncle
jim
matthews
he
jumps
up
and
says
he

want
to
see

he
gits

and
the
rest
of

set
still
and
waited
and
pretty
soon
here

sam
lookin
mad
enough
to
fight
all
creation
sure
enough
everybody
was
still
laughin
but
nobody
said
anything
to
sam
till
up
comes
old
man
bob
crawford
with
about
two
yards
o
blue
ribbon
he
jumped
over
into
the
ring
and
got
it
from
the
judges
as
soon
as
he
could
quit
laughin
and
says
he
i
have
seen
gracefuler
riders
and
riders
that
had
more
control
over
their
horses
but
says
he

on
a
horse

that
little
o
yours

now
and
i
goin

ribbon
on
you
jest
as
a
premium
for
stickin
on
when
you
might
jest
as
easy
fell
off
well
everybody
looked
for
sam
to
double
up
his
fist
and
knock
old
man
bob
down
and
he
might
done
it
but
milly
saw
how
things
was
goin
and
she
come
hurryin
up
milly
was
a
mighty
pretty
woman
and
always
dressed
herself
neat
and
trim
but
she
been
goin
around
with
little
sam
in
her
arms
and
her
hair
was
fallin
down
and
she
looked
like
any
woman
look
that
carried
a
heavy
baby
all
day
and
dragged
her
dress
over
a
dusty
floor
she
come
up
and
says
she
sam
you

to
crown
me
queen
o

folks
used
to
say
that
sam
never
was
so
mad
that
milly
could
make
him
laugh
and
says
he
look
like
a
queen
o
love
and
beauty
do
you
of
course
that
turned
the
laugh
on
milly
and
then

and
says
he
neighbors
i
made
a
fool
o
myself
and
no
mistake
and
you
all

as
much
as

and
he
took
old
man
bob
blue
ribbon
and
tied
it
on
little
sam
arm
and
him
and
milly
walked
off
together
as
pleasant
as
you
please
and
that
how
sam
amos
rode
in
the
said
aunt
jane
conclusively
as
she
arose
from
her
chair
and
shook
a
lapful
of
bean
pods
into
a
willow
basket
near
by
is
sam
amos
living
yet
i
asked
in
the
hope
of
prolonging
an
tale
a
softened
look
came
over
aunt
jane
face
no
child
she
said
quietly
sam
oldest
son

livin
yet
and
his
three
daughters
they
all
moved
out
o
the
goshen
neighborhood
long
ago
but
sam
been
in
his
grave
twenty
years
or
more
and
here
i
set
laughin
about
that
ride
o
his
somehow
or
other
i
outlived
nearly
all
of
and
now
when
i
git
to
callin
up
old
times
no
matter
where
i
start
out
i
pretty
certain
to
end
over
in
the
old
yonder
but
then
and
she
smiled
brightly
there
a
plenty
more
to
be
told
over
on
the
other
side
illustration
viii
mary
andrews
illustration
well
exclaimed
aunt
jane
as
she
surveyed
her
looks
like
mary
andrews
do
it
however
there
a
plenty
of
it
such
as
it
is
and
good
enough
what
there
is
of
it
as
the
old
man
said
so
set
down
child
and
help
yourself
a
loaf
of
aunt
jane
bread
a
plate
of
golden
butter
a
pitcher
of
jersey
milk
and
a
bowl
of
honey
in
the
comb
who
would
ask
for
more
and
as
i
sat
down
i
blessed
the
friendly
rain
that
had
kept
me
from
going
home
but
who
was
mary
andrews
and
what
about
her
i
asked
as
i
buttered
my
bread
eat
your
dinner
child
and
then
we
talk
about
mary
andrews
laughed
aunt
jane
if
i
thought
before
i
spoke
which
i
hardly
ever
do
i
would
mentioned
mary
andrews
for
i
know
you
let
me
see
any
rest
till
you
know
all
about
her
and
aunt
jane
was
quite
right
a
summer
rain
and
a
story
too
i
reckon
there
mighty
few
livin
that
ricollect
about
mary
andrews
and
her
she
said
meditatively
an
hour
later
when
the
dishes
had
been
washed
and
we
were
seated
in
the
parlor
mary
andrews
maiden
name
was
crawford
a
first
cousin
of
sam
crawford
she
was
her
father
was
jerry
crawford
a
brother
of
old
man
bob
and
her
mother
was
a
simpson
people
used
to
say
that
the
crawfords
and
the
simpsons
was
like
two
with
a
ditch
between
always
runnin
together
i
ricollect
one
year
three
crawford
sisters
married
three
simpson
brothers
mary
was
about
my
age
and
she
married
harvey
andrews
a
little
over
a
year
after
me
and
abram
married
and
there
few
women
i
ever
knew
better
and
liked
more
than
i
did
mary
andrews
i
ricollect
her
weddin
nearly
as
well
as
i
do
my
own
my
jane
was
jest
a
month
old
and
i
had
to
ask
mother
to
come
over
and
stay
with
the
baby
while
i
went
to
the
weddin
i
had
thought
much
about
what
i
wear
i
been
so
taken
up
with
the
baby
and
i
ricollect
i
went
to
the
big
chest
o
drawers
in
the
spare
room
and
jerked
out
my
weddin
dress
and
says
i
to
mother
be
two
brides
at
the
weddin
but
bless
your
life
when
i
tried
to
make
it
meet
around
my
waist
why
it
lacked
four
or
five
inches
of
comin
together
and
mother
set
and
laughed
fit
to
kill
and
says
she
that
dress
was
made
for
a
young
girl
and
you
never
be
a
young
girl
again
and
i
says
i
may
never
fasten
this
dress
around
my
waist
again
but
i
do
know
what
to
hinder
me
from
bein
a
young
girl
all
my
life
i
wish
to
goodness
she
went
on
that
i
could
ricollect
what
i
wore
to
mary
andrews
weddin
i
know
i
did
wear
my
weddin
dress
and
i
know
i
went
but
to
save
my
life
i
ca
call
up
the
dress
i
had
on
it
ai
like
me
to
forgit
the
clothes
i
used
to
wear
but
i
call
it
up
however
what
i
wore
to
mary
andrews
weddin
ai
got
anything
to
do
with
mary
andrews
aunt
jane
paused
and
scratched
her
head
reflectively
with
a
knitting
needle
evidently
she
was
loath
to
go
on
with
her
story
till
the
memory
of
that
wedding
garment
should
return
to
her
i
was
readin
the
other
day
she
continued
about
somethin
got
off
yonder
in
washington
some
sort
of
bureau
that
tells
folks
what
the
weather
be
and
warns
the
ships
about
settin
off
on
a
voyage
when
there
a
storm
ahead
and
says
i
to
myself
you
reckon
they
ever
git
so
smart
that
they
can
tell
what
sort
weather
there
is
ahead
o
two
people
jest
married
and
settin
out
on
the
voyage
that
wo
end
till
death
parts
and
what
sort
weather
they
goin
to
have
six
months
from
the
weddin
day
the
world
gittin
wiser
every
day
child
but
there
ai
nobody
wise
enough
to
tell
what
sort
of
a
husband
a
man
goin
to
make
nor
what
sort
of
a
wife
a
woman
goin
to
make
nor
how
a
weddin
is
goin
to
turn
out
i
watched
folks
marryin
for
seventy
years
and
i
do
know
much
more
about
it
than
i
did
when
i
was
a
child
i
seen
folks
marry
when
it
looked
like
certain
destruction
for
both
of
and
all
at
once
they
take
a
turn
that
surprise
everybody
and
things
would
come
out
all
right
with
there
was
wick
harris
and
virginia
matthews
wick
was
jest
such
a
boy
as
dick
elrod
and
virginia
was
another
annie
crawford
she
never
done
a
stitch
o
sewin
nor
cooked
a
meal
o
victuals
in
her
life
and
i
ricollect
her
mother
sayin
she
did
know
which
she
felt
sorriest
for
wick
or
virginia
and
she
wished
to
goodness
there
was
a
law
to
keep
such
folks
from
marryin
but
bless
your
life
instead
o
to
shipwreck
like
dick
and
annie
they
settled
down
as
steady
as
any
old
married
couple
you
ever
saw
wick
quit
his
drinkin
and
gamblin
and
virginia
why
there
was
a
better
housekeeper
in
the
state
nor
a
better
she
got
to
be
and
then
i
seen
marry
when
everything
looked
bright
ahead
and
everybody
was
certain
it
was
a
good
thing
for
both
of
and
it
turned
out
that
everybody
was
wrong
that
the
way
it
was
with
mary
andrews
and
harvey
nobody
had
a
misgivin
about
it
mary
was
as
happy
as
a
lark
and
harvey
looked
like
he
could
wait
for
the
day
and
everybody
said
they
was
made
for
each
other
to
be
sure
harvey
was
a
stranger
in
the
neighborhood
havin
moved
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
before
and
we
could
know
him
like
we
did
the
goshen
boys
that
been
born
and
brought
up
there
but
nobody
could
say
a
word
against
him
his
family
down
in
tennessee
jest
beyond
the
state
line
was
as
good
people
as
ever
lived
and
harvey
himself
was
industrious
and
steady
and
as
fine
lookin
a
man
as
you
see
in
a
week
journey
everybody
said
they
never
saw
a
handsomer
couple
than
harvey
and
mary
andrews
mary
was
a
tall
girl
always
carried
herself
like
a
queen
and
had
a
favor
to
ask
of
anybody
and
harvey
was
half
a
head
taller
and
jest
her
opposite
in
color
she
was
dark
and
he
was
light
they
was
a
fine
sight
standin
up
before
the
preacher
that
day
and
everybody
was
wishin
good
luck
though
it
looked
like
they
had
enough
already
both
of
young
and
healthy
and
happy
and
and
harvey
did
owe
a
cent
on
his
farm
and
father
had
furnished
the
house
complete
for
her
the
weddin
come
off
at
four
in
the
evenin
and
we
all
stayed
to
supper
and
after
supper
harvey
and
mary
drove
over
to
their
new
home
i
ricollect
how
mary
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
and
laughed
at
us
standin
on
the
steps
and
wavin
at
her
and
hollerin
it
was
the
fashion
in
that
day
for
all
the
neighbors
to
entertain
a
newly
married
couple
some
would
invite
to
dinner
and
some
to
supper
and
then
the
bride
and
groom
would
have
to
do
the
same
for
the
neighbors
and
then
the
honeymoon
be
over
and
they
settle
down
and
go
to
work
like
ordinary
folks
we
had
harvey
and
mary
over
to
dinner
and
they
asked
us
to
supper
i
ricollect
how
nice
the
table
looked
with
mary
new
blue
and
white
china
and
some
o
the
silver
that
been
in
the
family
for
generations
and
the
supper
matched
the
table
for
mary
was
the
kind
that
expects
company
to
satisfy
their
hunger
by
lookin
at
china
and
silver
she
was
a
fine
cook
like
her
mother
before
her
amos
and
marthy
matthews
had
been
invited
too
and
we
had
a
real
pleasant
time
laughin
and
jokin
like
folks
always
do
about
young
married
people
after
supper
we
all
went
out
on
the
porch
and
mary
whispered
to
me
and
marthy
to
come
and
see
her
china
closet
and
pantry
you
know
how
proud
a
young
housekeeper
is
of
such
things
she
showed
us
all
through
the
back
part
o
the
house
and
we
praised
everything
and
told
her
it
looked
like
old
experienced
housekeepin
instead
of
a
bride
well
when
we
went
back
to
the
on
our
way
to
the
porch
if
there
was
harvey
bendin
over
the
table
countin
the
silver
teaspoons
a
man
always
looks
out
o
place
doin
such
things
and
i
saw
mary
face
turn
red
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
but
nobody
said
anything
and
we
passed
on
through
and
left
harvey
still
countin
it
was
a
little
thing
but
i
could
help
thinkin
how
queer
it
was
for
a
man
that
had
been
married
two
weeks
to
leave
his
company
and
go
back
to
the
table
to
count
spoons
and
i
asked
myself
how
i
felt
if
i
found
abram
countin
spoons
durin
the
honeymoon
did
you
ever
take
a
walk
child
some
cloudy
night
when
covered
up
by
the
darkness
and
all
at
once
there
be
a
flash
lightnin
showin
up
everything
jest
for
a
second
well
that
the
way
it
is
with
people
lives
near
as
harvey
and
mary
lived
to
me
and
friendly
as
we
were
i
could
tell
what
was
happenin
between
but
every
now
and
then
as
the
months
went
by
and
the
years
see
or
hear
somethin
that
was
like
a
flash
of
light
in
a
dark
place
sometimes
it
was
jest
a
look
but
there
mighty
little
a
look
tell
and
as
for
actions
you
know
they
speak
louder
than
words
i
ricollect
one
sunday
harvey
and
mary
was
walkin
ahead
o
me
and
abram
there
was
a
rough
piece
o
road
jest
in
front
of
the
church
and
i
heard
harvey
say
walk
there
come
over
on
the
side
where
it
smooth
i
reckon
mary
thought
that
harvey
was
thinkin
of
her
feet
for
she
stepped
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
right
at
once
and
says
he
you
know
them
stones
wear
out
your
shoes
anything
and
bless
your
life
if
mary
did
go
right
back
to
the
middle
of
the
road
and
she
took
particular
pains
to
walk
on
the
stones
as
far
as
they
went
it
was
a
little
thing
to
be
sure
but
it
showed
that
harvey
was
thinkin
more
of
his
wife
shoes
than
he
was
of
her
feet
and
that
ai
a
little
thing
to
a
woman
then
again
there
was
the
time
when
me
and
abram
was
harvey
place
one
evenin
and
a
storm
was
comin
up
and
we
stopped
in
to
keep
from
gittin
wet
mary
had
been
to
town
that
day
and
she
had
on
her
best
dress
she
was
a
woman
that
looked
well
in
anything
she
put
on
plain
clothes
could
make
her
look
plain
and
she
set
off
fine
clothes
as
much
as
they
set
her
off
me
and
abram
took
seats
on
the
porch
and
mary
went
into
the
hall
to
git
another
chair
i
heard
the
back
hall
door
open
and
somebody
come
in
and
then
i
heard
harvey
voice
says
he
and
take
off
that
dress
says
he
the
use
of
wearin
out
your
best
clothes
here
at
home
but
before
he
got
the
last
words
out
mary
was
on
the
porch
with
the
chair
in
her
hand
talkin
to
us
about
her
trip
to
town
and
as
unconcerned
as
if
she
had
heard
or
seen
harvey
that
night
i
says
to
abram
says
i
did
you
ever
have
any
cause
to
think
that
harvey
andrews
was
a
close
man
abram
thought
a
minute
and
says
he
no
i
ca
say
i
ever
did
what
put
such
a
notion
into
your
head
jane
harvey
looks
after
his
own
interests
in
a
trade
but
he
as
liberal
a
giver
as
there
is
in
goshen
church
besides
says
abram
ever
heard
of
a
tall
personable
man
like
harvey
bein
close
stingy
people
always
dried
up
and
shriveled
lookin
but
i
made
up
my
mind
what
the
trouble
was
between
harvey
and
mary
and
nothin
that
abram
said
could
change
it
i
do
reckon
any
man
knows
how
women
feel
about
stinginess
and
closeness
in
their
husbands
i
believe
most
women
rather
live
with
a
man
that
killed
somebody
than
one
that
was
stingy
and
then
mary
never
was
used
to
anything
of
that
kind
for
her
father
old
man
jerry
crawford
was
one
o
the
men
in
the
county
it
was
in
and
make
yourself
at
home
with
everybody
that
darkened
his
door
and
for
a
woman
raised
like
mary
was
havin
to
live
with
a
man
like
harvey
was
about
the
hardest
thing
that
could
happened
to
her
however
she
had
the
crawford
pride
and
she
carried
her
head
high
and
laughed
and
smiled
as
much
as
ever
but
there
a
look
that
tells
plain
enough
whether
a
woman
married
to
a
man
or
whether
she
jest
tied
to
him
and
with
him
because
she
ca
get
free
and
when
mary
was
laughin
or
smilin
i
could
tell
by
her
face
that
she
was
as
happy
as
we
all
thought
she
was
goin
to
be
the
day
she
married
harvey
aunt
jane
paused
a
moment
to
pick
up
a
dropped
stitch
it
a
good
thing
you
had
your
dinner
honey
before
i
started
this
yarn
she
said
looking
at
me
quizzically
over
her
glasses
for
be
a
long
time
bringin
you
to
the
but
i
got
to
tell
you
all
this
rigmarole
first
so
you
understand
what
comin
if
i
was
to
tell
you
about
the
first
you
get
a
wrong
idea
about
mary
that
how
folks
misjudges
one
another
they
see
people
doin
things
that
ai
right
and
they
up
and
conclude
they
bad
people
when
if
they
only
knew
somethin
about
their
lives
understand
how
to
make
allowance
for
you
got
to
know
a
heap
about
people
lives
child
before
you
can
judge
well
along
about
this
time
somewhere
in
the
i
reckon
it
must
been
there
was
a
big
excitement
about
politics
i
ca
somehow
ricollect
what
it
was
all
about
but
they
had
speakin
everywhere
and
the
men
could
talk
about
anything
but
politics
from
till
night
abram
was
goin
in
to
town
every
week
to
some
meetin
or
speakin
and
finally
they
had
a
big
rally
and
a
barbecue
at
goshen
one
of
the
speakers
was
judge
mcgowan
from
tennessee
and
he
was
a
cousin
of
harvey
andrews
on
his
mother
side
here
aunt
jane
paused
again
i
wish
i
could
ricollect
what
it
was
all
about
she
said
musingly
must
been
something
mighty
important
but
it
slipped
my
memory
sure
i
do
ricollect
though
hearin
sam
amos
say
to
old
squire
bentham
the
matter
anyhow
ai
kentucky
politicians
got
enough
gift
o
gab
without
sendin
down
to
tennessee
to
git
somebody
to
help
you
out
and
the
old
squire
laughed
fit
to
kill
and
says
he
all
on
your
account
sam
we
heard
you
was
against
us
and
we
knew
there
was
an
orator
in
kentucky
that
could
make
you
change
your
mind
so
we
sent
down
to
tennessee
for
judge
mcgowan
and
we
relyin
on
him
to
bring
you
over
to
our
side
and
that
like
to
tickled
sam
to
death
well
when
harvey
heard
his
cousin
was
to
be
one
o
the
big
men
at
the
speakin
he
was
mighty
proud
as
anybody
would
been
and
nothin
would
do
but
he
must
have
judge
mcgowan
to
eat
dinner
at
his
house
some
of
the
men
objected
to
this
and
said
the
speakers
ought
to
eat
at
the
barbecue
but
harvey
said
that
blood
was
thicker
than
water
with
him
and
no
cousin
o
his
could
come
to
goshen
and
go
away
without
eatin
a
meal
at
his
house
so
it
was
fixed
up
that
everybody
else
was
to
eat
at
the
barbecue
and
harvey
was
to
take
judge
mcgowan
over
to
his
house
to
a
family
i
dropped
in
to
see
mary
two
or
three
days
before
the
speakin
and
when
i
was
leavin
i
said
if
there
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
about
your
jest
let
me
know
and
she
said
ai
a
thing
to
do
harvey
been
to
town
and
bought
everything
he
could
think
of
in
the
way
of
groceries
and
jane
comin
over
to
cook
the
dinner
but
thank
you
all
the
same
i
thought
mary
looked
pleased
and
satisfied
and
i
says
with
everything
to
cook
and
jane
ann
to
cook
it
there
wo
be
anything
lackin
about
that
dinner
and
mary
laughed
and
says
she
know
i
my
father
own
child
old
jerry
used
to
say
no
visit
unless
you
waller
a
bed
and
empty
a
plate
they
used
tell
it
that
aunt
maria
the
cook
never
had
a
chance
to
clean
up
the
kitchen
between
meals
and
the
neighbors
all
called
jerry
house
the
free
tavern
i
heard
folks
laugh
many
a
time
over
the
children
recitin
the
ten
commandments
sunday
evenin
and
jerry
would
holler
at
when
they
got
through
and
say
commandment
for
kentuckians
is
be
not
forgetful
to
entertain
strangers
and
never
mind
about
turnin
out
to
be
angels
plain
folks
is
good
enough
for
me
here
i
am
strayin
off
from
the
dinner
jest
like
i
always
do
when
i
set
out
to
tell
anything
or
go
anywhere
abram
used
to
say
that
if
i
started
to
the
i
go
by
way
o
the
front
porch
and
the
front
yard
and
the
back
porch
and
the
back
yard
and
the
flower
gyarden
and
the
vegetable
gyarden
to
git
there
well
the
day
come
and
judge
mcgowan
made
a
fine
speech
and
harvey
carried
him
off
in
his
new
buggy
as
proud
as
a
peacock
i
ricollect
when
i
set
down
to
my
table
that
day
i
said
to
myself
know
judge
mcgowan
havin
a
dinner
that
make
him
remember
kentucky
as
long
as
he
lives
and
it
was
till
years
afterwards
that
i
heard
the
truth
about
that
dinner
jane
ann
herself
told
me
and
i
believe
she
ever
told
anybody
else
jane
ann
was
crippled
for
a
year
or
more
before
she
died
and
the
neighbors
had
to
do
a
good
deal
of
nursin
and
waitin
on
her
i
was
makin
her
a
cup
o
tea
one
day
and
the
kittle
was
bubblin
and
singin
and
she
begun
to
laugh
and
says
she
do
you
hear
that
sparrer
chirpin
in
the
peach
tree
there
by
the
window
says
she
never
hear
a
sparrer
chirpin
and
a
kittle
that
i
do
think
o
the
dinner
mary
andrews
had
the
day
judge
mcgowan
spoke
at
the
big
barbecue
says
she
dead
and
harvey
dead
and
i
reckon
there
ai
any
harm
in
speakin
of
it
now
and
then
she
told
me
the
story
i
tellin
you
she
said
she
went
over
that
mornin
bright
and
early
and
there
was
mary
sittin
on
the
back
porch
sewin
the
house
was
all
cleaned
up
and
there
was
a
big
panful
o
greens
on
the
kitchen
table
but
not
a
sign
of
a
company
dinner
anywhere
in
sight
jane
ann
said
mary
spoke
up
as
bright
and
pleasant
as
possible
and
told
her
to
set
down
and
rest
herself
and
she
went
on
sewin
and
they
talked
about
this
and
that
for
a
while
and
finally
jane
ann
rolled
up
her
sleeves
and
says
she
a
pretty
fast
worker
mis
andrews
but
a
company
dinner
ai
any
small
matter
do
you
think
it
time
to
begin
work
and
mary
jest
smiled
and
said
in
her
easy
way
jane
ann
not
much
to
do
it
wo
take
long
for
the
greens
to
cook
and
i
want
you
to
make
some
of
your
good
corn
bread
to
go
with
and
then
she
went
on
sewin
and
talkin
and
all
jane
ann
could
do
was
to
set
there
and
listen
and
wonder
what
it
all
meant
finally
the
clock
struck
eleven
and
mary
rolled
up
her
work
and
says
she
better
make
up
your
fire
now
jane
ann
and
i
set
the
table
harvey
likes
an
early
dinner
jane
ann
said
she
expected
to
see
mary
get
out
the
best
china
and
silver
and
the
finest
tablecloth
and
napkins
she
had
but
instead
that
she
put
on
jest
plain
everyday
things
everything
was
clean
and
nice
but
it
was
the
way
to
set
the
table
for
a
company
dinner
and
nobody
knew
that
better
than
mary
andrews
jane
ann
said
she
saw
a
ham
and
plenty
o
vegetables
and
eggs
in
the
pantry
and
she
could
hardly
keep
her
hands
off
and
she
did
smuggle
some
potatoes
into
the
stove
after
she
got
her
greens
washed
and
her
meal
scalded
she
said
she
knew
somethin
was
wrong
but
all
she
could
do
was
to
hold
her
tongue
and
do
her
work
that
was
jane
ann
way
when
mary
got
through
settin
the
table
she
went
and
put
on
her
best
dress
trouble
had
pulled
her
down
a
bit
and
if
anything
she
was
handsomer
than
she
was
the
day
she
married
i
reckon
it
was
her
spirit
that
kept
her
from
breakin
and
growin
old
before
her
time
jane
ann
said
she
come
her
eyes
sparklin
like
a
girl
and
a
bright
color
in
her
cheeks
and
she
had
on
a
flowered
muslin
dress
white
ground
with
sprigs
o
lilac
all
over
it
and
lace
in
the
neck
and
angel
sleeves
that
showed
off
her
arms
and
her
hair
was
twisted
high
up
on
her
head
and
a
big
comb
in
it
jane
ann
said
she
looked
as
pretty
as
a
picture
and
jest
as
she
come
down
the
stairs
harvey
drove
up
with
judge
mcgowan
and
mary
walked
out
to
give
him
a
welcome
while
harvey
put
away
the
buggy
nobody
had
pleasanter
ways
than
mary
andrews
she
always
had
somethin
to
say
and
it
was
always
the
right
thing
to
be
said
and
in
a
minute
her
and
the
old
judge
was
laughin
like
known
each
other
all
their
lives
and
he
had
the
children
on
his
knees
trottin
and
tellin
about
his
little
girl
and
boy
at
home
jane
ann
said
her
greens
was
about
done
and
she
started
to
put
on
the
corn
bread
but
somethin
held
her
back
she
knew
corn
bread
and
greens
was
a
fit
dinner
for
a
stranger
that
had
been
invited
there
but
of
course
she
could
do
anything
without
orders
and
she
was
standin
over
the
stove
waitin
and
wonderin
when
harvey
walked
in
to
see
how
dinner
was
gettin
on
jane
ann
said
he
looked
at
the
pot
o
greens
and
the
pan
of
corn
bread
batter
and
he
went
into
the
and
saw
the
table
all
clean
but
nothin
on
it
beyond
the
ordinary
and
his
face
looked
like
a
and
jest
then
mary
come
in
all
smilin
and
the
prettiest
color
in
her
cheeks
and
harvey
wheeled
around
and
says
he
does
this
mean
where
the
ham
i
told
you
to
cook
and
all
the
rest
o
the
things
i
bought
for
this
dinner
jane
ann
said
the
way
he
spoke
and
the
look
in
his
eyes
would
frightened
most
any
woman
but
mary
she
was
the
kind
to
be
frightened
jane
ann
said
she
stood
up
straight
with
her
head
thrown
back
and
still
smilin
and
her
voice
was
as
clear
and
sweet
as
if
she
been
sayin
somethin
pleasant
and
she
looked
harvey
straight
in
the
eyes
and
says
she
means
harvey
that
what
good
enough
for
us
is
good
enough
for
your
kin
jane
ann
said
that
harvey
looked
at
her
a
second
as
if
he
did
understand
and
then
he
give
a
start
as
if
he
ricollected
somethin
and
it
looked
like
all
the
blood
in
his
body
rushed
to
his
face
and
he
lifted
one
hand
and
opened
his
mouth
like
he
was
goin
to
speak
there
they
stood
lookin
at
each
other
and
jane
ann
said
she
never
saw
such
a
look
pass
between
husband
and
wife
before
or
since
if
either
of
had
dropped
dead
she
said
it
would
seemed
strange
honey
i
read
a
story
once
about
two
men
that
had
quarreled
and
one
of
picked
up
a
little
rock
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
for
eight
years
he
carried
that
rock
and
once
a
year
he
turn
it
over
and
at
last
one
day
he
met
the
man
he
hated
and
he
took
out
the
rock
been
carryin
so
long
and
threw
it
at
him
and
it
struck
him
dead
now
i
know
as
well
as
if
mary
andrews
had
told
me
that
harvey
had
said
them
very
same
words
to
her
years
before
and
she
carried
in
her
heart
jest
like
the
man
carried
the
stone
in
his
pocket
waitin
till
she
could
throw
back
at
him
and
hurt
him
as
much
as
he
hurt
her
it
was
right
nor
christian
but
knowin
mary
andrews
as
i
did
i
never
had
a
word
o
blame
for
her
there
never
was
a
woman
than
mary
and
i
always
thought
she
must
gone
through
a
heap
to
make
her
say
such
a
thing
to
harvey
jane
ann
said
that
when
she
worked
at
a
place
she
always
tried
to
be
blind
and
deaf
so
far
as
family
matters
was
concerned
and
she
knew
that
she
had
no
business
seein
or
hearin
anything
that
went
on
between
harvey
and
mary
but
there
they
stood
facin
each
other
and
she
could
hear
a
sparrer
chirpin
outside
and
the
on
the
stove
while
she
stood
watchin
feelin
like
she
was
charmed
by
a
snake
she
said
the
look
in
mary
eyes
and
the
way
she
smiled
made
her
blood
run
cold
and
harvey
could
stand
it
he
had
to
give
in
jane
ann
said
his
hand
dropped
and
he
turned
and
walked
out
o
the
house
and
down
towards
the
barn
mary
watched
him
till
he
was
out
sight
and
then
she
went
back
to
the
front
porch
and
the
next
minute
she
was
laughin
and
talkin
with
harvey
cousin
as
if
nothin
had
happened
well
for
the
next
half
hour
jane
ann
said
she
made
her
two
hands
do
the
work
of
four
and
when
she
put
the
dinner
on
the
table
it
was
nothin
to
be
ashamed
of
she
sliced
some
ham
and
fried
it
and
made
coffee
and
soda
biscuits
and
poached
some
eggs
and
when
they
set
down
to
the
table
and
the
old
judge
said
grace
he
looked
around
and
says
he
did

that
awful
smile
on
her

and
looked
her

in
the
eyes
till
she
looked
him
down

she
expected

minute
and
she
kept
things
hot
while
she
was
washin
up

two
and

few
minutes
come
drivin
back
in
the
buggy
jane

said
the

unharnessed
at
all
her
and
the
judge
got
in
with
the
two
children
down

they
drove
off
to
catch
the
train
jane
ann
said
she
straightened
everything
up
in
the
kitchen
and
and
shut
up
the
house
and
then
she
went
out
in
the
yard
and
walked
down
in
the
direction
of
the
stable
and
there
was
harvey
standin
in
the
she
said
his
face
was
turned
away
from
her
and
she
was
glad
it
was
for
it
scared
her
jest
to
look
at
his
back
he
was
standin
as
still
as
a
statue
his
arms
hangin
down
by
his
sides
and
both
hands
clenched
and
it
looked
like
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stand
there
till
judgment
day
jane
ann
said
she
wondered
many
a
time
how
long
he
stayed
there
and
whether
he
ever
did
come
to
the
house
i
ricollect
how
everybody
was
talkin
about
the
speakin
that
day
abram

says
he
i
heard
such
a
speech
as
that
since
the
days
of
old
humphrey
marshall
and
as
for
the
barbecue
all
it
needed
was
judge
mcgowan
to
set
at
the
head
o
the
table
but
then
says
he
reckon
it
was
natural
for
harvey
to
want
to
take
his
cousin
home
with
him
that
was
about
four
and
it
was
more
than
two

and
says

a
tear
nor

word
and
she
do
seem
to
notice

to

and
milly
lookin

and
with

he
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
off
and
i
went
into
the
house
to
put
the
children
to
bed
then
i
set
down
on
the
porch
steps
to
wait
for
abram
the
sun
was
down
by
this
time
and
there
was
a
new
moon
in
the
west
and
it
did
seem
like
there
could
be
any
sorrow
and
sufferin
in
such
a
quiet
happy
world
but
there
was
poor
mary
not
a
mile
away
and
i
set
and
grieved
over
her
in
her
trouble
jest
like
it
had
been
my
own
i
did
know
what
had
happened
that
day
between
harvey
and
mary
but
i
knew
that
harvey
had
been
struck
down
in
the
prime
o
life
and
that
mary
had
found
his
dead
body
and
that
was
terrible
enough
from
what
i
seen
o
their
married
life
i
knew
that
mary
loss
was
what
mine
would
been
if
abram
had
dropped
dead
that
day
instead
o
harvey
but
a
man
and
woman
ca
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
and
father
and
mother
without
growin
to
each
other
and
whatever
mary
had
lost
she
had
lost
the
father
of
her
children
and
i
could
sleep
much
that
night
for
thinkin
of
her
the
day
of
the
funeral
i
went
over
to
help
mary
and
get
her
dressed
in
her
widow
clothes
she
was
actin
queer
and
dazed
and
seemed
to
make
much
impression
on
her
i
was
fastenin
her
crape
collar
on
and
she
says
to
me
reckon
you
think
it
strange
i
do
cry
and
take
on
like
women
do
when
they
lose
their
husbands
but
says
she
would
blame
me
if
you
knew
and
then
she
dropped
her
voice
down
to
a
whisper
and
says
she
know
i
married
harvey
andrews
but
after
i
married
him
i
found
that
there
was
any
such
man
i
have
got
any
cause
to
cry
for
the
man
i
married
ai
dead
he
never
was
alive
and
so
of
course
he
be
dead
and
then
she
began
to
laugh
and
says
she
do
know
which
is
the
worst
to
be
sorry
when
you
ought
to
be
glad
or
glad
when
you
ought
to
be
sorry
and
i
says
mary
do
talk
about
it
i
know
what
you
mean
but
other
folks
might
not
understand
mary
ai
the
only
one
child
that
married
a
man
and
then
found
out
that
there
any
such
i
looked
at
many
a
bride
and
groom
standin
up
before
the
preacher
and
makin
promises
for
a
lifetime
and
i
thought
to
myself
pore
things
you
all
you
know
about
each
other
is
your
names
and
your
faces
you
got
all
the
rest
to
find
out
and
nobody
knows
what
you
find
out
nor
what
you
do
when
you
find
it
out
folks
said
it
was
the
saddest
funeral
they
ever
went
to
people
all
lived
down
in
tennessee
his
father
and
mother
had
died
long
ago
and
he
had
any
near
kin
except
a
brother
and
a
sister
and
they
lived
too
far
off
to
come
to
the
funeral
in
time
abram
said
to
me
after
we
got
home
i
never
thought
i
help
to
lay
a
friend
and
neighbor
in
the
ground
and
not
a
tear
shed
over
him
if
mary
had
cried
we
could
cried
with
her
but
she
set
at
the
head
o
the
coffin
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
her
mind
seemed
to
be
away
off
from
the
things
that
was
happenin
around
her
i
do
believe
she
even
heard
the
clods
fallin
on
the
coffin
and
when
we
started
away
from
the
grave
marthy
matthews
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
me
do
mary
remind
you
of
somebody
walkin
in
her
sleep
mary
mother
and
sister
had
been
with
her
in
her
trouble
for
they
happened
to
be
down
in
logan
visitin
a
so
marthy
and
me
settled
it
between
us
that
she
was
to
stay
with
mary
that
night
and
i
was
to
come
over
the
next
mornin
you
know
how
much
there
is
to
be
done
after
a
funeral
well
bright
and
early
i
went
over
and
marthy
met
me
at
the
gate
she
was
goin
out
as
i
was
in
says
she
right
mary
lookin
for
you
she
more
like
herself
this
mornin
and
i
thankful
for
that
the
minute
i
stepped
in
the
door
i
heard
mary
voice
she
seen
me
comin
in
the
gate
and
called
out
to
me
to
come
she
was
in
the
front
room
her
room
and
harvey
and
the
closet
and
the
bureau
drawers
was
all
open
and
things
scattered
around
every
which
way
and
mary
was
down
on
her
knees
in
front
of
an
old
trunk
foldin
up
harvey
clothes
and
puttin
away
her
hands
was
shakin
and
there
was
a
red
spot
on
each
of
her
cheeks
and
she
had
a
strange
look
out
of
her
eyes
i
says
to
her
mary
you
ai
fit
to
be
doin
that
work
you
ought
to
be
in

and
says
she
ca

out
mother
and
sister
sally
are

says
she
i
want
to
get
everything

i
says
mary

bed
and
i
put

things
away

can
watch
me
and
tell
me
what
to

and
i

it
but
you

to
rest
so
i
shook
everything
out
and
folded
it
up
as
nice
as
i
could
and
laid
it
away
in
the
trunk
while
she
watched
me
and
once
she
said
have
any
wrinkles
in
harvey
was
always
mighty
particular
about
his
clothes
next
to
layin
the
body
in
the
ground
child
this
foldin
up
dead
folks
clothes
and
puttin
away
is
one
o
the
hardest
things
people
ever
has
to
do
it
jest
like
when
you
finished
a
book
and
shut
it
up
and
put
it
away
on
the
shelf
i
knew
jest
how
mary
felt
when
she
said
she
could
rest
till
everything
was
put
away
the
life
she
lived
with
harvey
was
over
and
she
was
closin
up
the
book
and
puttin
it
out
of
sight
forever
pore
child
pore
child
well
when
i
got
all
o
harvey
clothes
put
away
i
washed
out
the
empty
drawers
lined
with
clean
paper
and
laid
some
o
little
harvey
clothes
in
and
that
seemed
to
please
mary
the
father
was
gone
but
there
was
his
son
to
take
his
place
then
i
shut
it
up
tight
and
mary
raised
herself
up
out
o
bed
and
says
she
hold
jane
i
goin
to
take
this
to
the
attic
right
now
and
take
it
we
did
though
the
trunk
was
heavy
and
the
stairs
so
steep
and
narrer
we
had
to
stop
and
rest
on
every
step
we
pushed
the
trunk
way
back
under
the
eaves
and
it
may
be
standin
there
yet
for
all
i
know
when
we
got
mary
drew
a
long
breath
like
she
got
a
big
load
off
her
mind
and
says
she
one
more
thing
i
want
you
to
help
me
about
and
then
you
can
go
home
jane
and
i
go
to
bed
and
rest
she
took
a
key
out
of
her
pocket
and
says
she
this
is
the
key
to
the
little
cabin
out
in
the
back
yard
harvey
used
to
keep
something
in
there
but
what
it
was
i
never
knew
as
long
as
we
lived
together
i
never
saw
inside
of
that
cabin
but
i
goin
to
see
it
now
the
children
started
to
foller
us
when
we
went
out
on
the
back
porch
but
mary
give
some
playthings
and
told
to
stay
around
in
the
front
yard
till
we
come
back
then
we
went
over
to
the
far
corner
of
the
back
yard
where
the
cabin
was
under
a
big
old
sycamore
tree
i
ricollect
how
the
key
creaked
when
mary
turned
it
and
how
hard
the
door
was
to
open
mary
started
to
go
in
first
and
then
she
fell
back
and
says
she
in
a
whisper
go
in
first
jane
i
afraid
so
i
went
in
first
and
mary
follered
for
a
minute
we
could
see
a
thing
there
was
two
windows
to
the
cabin
but
they
been
boarded
up
from
the
outside
and
there
was
jest
one
big
crack
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
windows
that
let
in
a
long
streak
of
light
and
you
could
see
the
dust
dancin
in
it
the
door
opened
jest
enough
to
let
us
in
and
we
both
stood
there
peerin
around
and
tryin
to
see
what
sort
of
a
place
we
got
into
the
first
thing
i
made
out
was
a
heap
of
old
rusty
iron
i
started
to
take
a
step
and
my
foot
struck
against
it
there
was
old
bolts
and
screws
and
horseshoes
and
scraps
of
old
cast
iron
and
nails
of
every
size
all
laid
together
in
a
big
heap
the
place
seemed
to
be
full
of
somethin
but
i
could
see
what
it
all
was
till
my
eyes
got
used
to
the
darkness
there
was
a
row
of
nails
goin
all
round
the
wall
and
old
clothes
hangin
on
every
one
of
and
down
on
the
floor
there
was
piles
of
old
clothes
folded
smooth
and
laid
one
on
top
o
the
other
jest
like
a
washerwoman
would
fold
and
pile
up
old
clothes
and
mary
and
the
children
things
that
any
person
would
put
in
the
or
given
away
to
anybody
that
could
make
use
of
there
they
was
all
hoarded
up
in
that
old
room
jest
like
they
was
of
some
value
and
over
in
one
corner
was
all
the
old
tin
things
that
you
could
think
of
buckets
and
pans
and
and
dippers
and
cups
and
next
to
them
was
all
the
glass
and
china
that
been
broken
in
the
years
mary
and
harvey
been
keepin
house
and
there
was
a
lot
of
old
brooms
nothin
but
stubs
tied
together
jest
like
new
brooms
in
the
store
and
there
was
all
the
children
broken
toys
dolls
and
doll
dresses
and
even
some
glass
marbles
that
little
harvey
used
to
play
with
the
dust
was
lyin
thick
and
heavy
over
everything
and
the
spiderwebs
looked
like
black
strings
hangin
from
the
ceilin
but
things
of
the
same
sort
was
all
lyin
together
jest
like
some
woman
had
put
the
place
in
order
you
heard
tell
of
that
bird
child
that
gathers
up
all
sorts
rubbish
and
carries
it
off
to
its
nest
and
hides
it
well
i
thought
about
that
bird
and
the
heap
of
old
iron
reminded
me
of
a
little
boy
pocket
when
you
turn
it
wrong
side
out
at
night
and
the
china
and
glass
and
made
me
think
of
the
playhouses
i
used
to
make
under
the
trees
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
seen
many
curious
places
honey
but
nothin
like
that
old
cabin
the
moldy
smell
reminded
me
of
the
grave
and
when
i
looked
at
all
the
dusty
old
plunder
the
ragged
clothes
hangin
against
the
wall
like
so
many
ghosts
and
then
thought
of
the
dead
man
that
had
put
there
i
tell
you
it
made
my
flesh
creep
well
we
stood
there
me
and
mary
strainin
our
eyes
tryin
to
see
into
the
dark
corners
and
all
at
once
the
meanin
of
it
come
over
me
like
a
flash
was
a
miser
aunt
jane
stopped
took
off
her
glasses
and
polished
them
on
the
hem
of
her
gingham
apron
i
sat
holding
my
breath
but
all
regardless
of
my
suspense
she
dropped
the
thread
of
the
story
and
followed
memory
in
one
of
her
capricious
backward
flights
i
ricollect
a
sermon
i
heard
when
i
was
a
gyirl
she
said
it
often
i
reckon
that
a
sermon
makes
much
impression
on
a
mind
but
this
was
any
ordinary
sermon
or
any
ordinary
preacher
presbytery
met
in
town
that
year
and
all
the
big
preachers
in
the
state
was
there
some
of
come
out
and
preached
to
the
country
churches
and
old
samuel
chalmers
morse
preached
at
goshen
he
was
one
o
the
biggest
men
in
the
presbytery
and
i
ricollect
his
looks
as
plain
as
i
ricollect
his
sermon
some
preachers
look
jest
like
other
men
and
you
can
tell
the
minute
you
set
eyes
on
that
they
any
wiser
or
any
better
than
common
folks
but
morse
was
that
kind
you
know
the
bible
tells
about
people
walkin
with
god
and
with
god
it
says
enoch
walked
with
god
and
adam
talked
with
him
some
folks
might
find
that
hard
to
believe
but
it
seems
jest
as
natural
to
me
why
many
a
time
i
been
in
my
gyarden
when
the
gone
down
and
it
ai
quite
time
for
the
moon
to
come
up
and
the
dew
fallin
and
the
flowers
smellin
sweet
and
i
set
down
in
the
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
if
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
it
would
been
a
bit
stranger
to
me
than
the
blowin
of
the
wind
the
minute
i
saw
morse
i
thought
about
adam
and
enoch
and
i
said
to
myself
looks
like
a
man
that
walked
with
god
and
talked
with
god
i
did
look
at
the
people
hats
and
bonnets
that
day
half
as
much
as
i
usually
did
and
part
of
that
sermon
stayed
by
me
all
my
life
he
preached
about
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
image
he
saw
in
his
dream
with
the
head
of
gold
and
the
feet
of
clay
and
he
said
that
every
human
being
was
like
that
image
there
was
gold
and
there
was
clay
in
every
one
of
us
part
of
us
was
human
and
part
was
divine
part
of
us
was
earthly
like
the
clay
and
part
heavenly
like
the
gold
and
he
said
that
in
some
folks
you
could
see
anything
but
the
clay
but
that
the
gold
was
there
and
if
you
looked
long
enough
you
find
it
and
some
folks
he
said
looked
like
they
was
all
gold
but
somewhere
or
other
there
was
the
clay
too
and
nobody
was
so
good
but
what
he
had
his
secret
sins
and
open
faults
and
he
said
sin
was
jest
another
name
for
ignorance
and
that
christ
knew
this
when
he
prayed
on
the
cross
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
he
said
everybody
would
do
right
if
they
knew
what
was
right
to
do
and
that
the
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
look
for
the
gold
and
not
the
clay
in
other
folks
for
the
gold
was
the
part
that
would
never
die
and
the
clay
was
jest
the
mortal
part
that
we
dropped
when
this
mortal
shall
have
put
on
immortality
child
that
sermon
come
home
to
me
many
a
time
when
i
caught
myself
weighin
people
in
the
balance
and
findin
wantin
what
i
been
doin
all
them
years
with
pore
harvey
i
seen
things
every
once
in
a
while
that
let
in
a
little
light
on
his
life
and
mary
but
the
old
cabin
made
it
all
plain
as
day
and
it
seemed
like
every
piece
o
rubbish
in
it
rose
up
in
judgment
against
me
i
never
felt
like
cryin
at
harvey
funeral
but
when
i
stood
there
around
the
tears
burnt
my
eyes
and
i
says
to
myself
and
gold
clay
and
gold
the
same
thought
must
struck
mary
at
the
same
minute
it
did
me
for
she
fell
on
her
knees
moanin
and
wringin
her
hands
and
cryin
forgive
me
god
forgive
me
i
see
it
all
now
he
could
help
it
and
i
been
a
hard
woman
and
god
judge
me
as
i
judged
harvey
the
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
skeered
me
and
i
saw
that
the
quicker
i
got
her
out
o
the
old
cabin
the
better
i
put
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
says
i
mary
get
up
and
come
back
to
the
house
but
do
let
the
children
hear
you
takin
on
so
you
might
skeer
little
harvey
she
stopped
a
minute
and
stared
at
me
and
then
she
caught
hold
o
my
hand
and
says
she
no
the
children
must
ever
know
anything
about
it
and
nobody
must
ever
see
the
inside
o
that
awful
place
come
quick
says
she
and
she
got
up
from
her
knees
and
pulled
me
outside
of
the
door
and
locked
it
and
dropped
the
key
in
her
apron
pocket
little
harvey
come
runnin
up
to
her
and
i
was
in
hopes
the
sight
of
the
child
would
bring
her
to
herself
but
she
walked
on
as
if
she
had
seen
him
and
as
soon
as
she
got
she
fell
down
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
and
went
to
wringin
her
hands
and
beatin
her
breast
and
cryin
without
tears
honey
if
you
done
a
wrong
to
a
livin
person
you
need
set
down
and
grieve
over
it
you
can
go
right
to
the
person
and
make
it
right
or
try
to
make
it
right
but
when
the
one
you
wronged
is
dead
and
the
grave
lies
between
you
that
the
sort
o
grief
that
breaks
hearts
and
makes
people
lose
their
minds
and
that
was
what
mary
andrews
had
to
bear
when
she
opened
the
door
o
that
old
cabin
and
saw
into
harvey
nature
and
felt
that
she
had
misjudged
and
condemned
him
i
could
do
anything
for
a
long
time
but
jest
sit
by
her
and
listen
while
she
called
harvey
back
from
the
dead
and
called
on
god
to
forgive
her
and
blamed
herself
for
all
that
had
ever
gone
wrong
between
but
at
last
she
wore
herself
out
and
had
to
stop
and
says
i
i
do
know
what
passed
between
you
and
harvey
and
she
broke
in
and
says
she
no
you
do
know
and
nobody
on
this
earth
knows
what
been
through
i
used
to
feel
like
i
was
in
an
iron
cage
that
got
smaller
and
smaller
every
day
and
i
knew
the
day
was
comin
when
it
would
shut
in
on
me
and
crush
me
but
i
would
give
in
to
harvey
i
would
let
him
have
his
own
way
and
i
fought
him
and
hated
him
and
despised
him
and
now
i
see
he
could
help
it
and
i
feel
like
been
strikin
a
crippled
child
a
crippled
child
that
was
jest
what
pore
harvey
was
but
i
knew
it
was
right
for
mary
to
take
all
the
blame
on
herself
and
says
i
if
harvey
could
keep
other
people
from
knowin
what
he
was
could
he
have
kept
you
from
knowin
it
too
if
he
was
to
other
people
what
was
to
hinder
him
from
bein
the
same
way
to
you
says
i
there
any
blame
in
this
matter
it
belongs
as
much
to
harvey
as
it
does
to
you
when
you
look
at
that
old
cabin
says
i
ca
have
any
hard
feelin
toward
pore
harvey
you
forgiven
him
and
now
says
i
jest
one
more
person
you
got
to
forgive
and
that
yourself
says
i
jest
as
wrong
to
be
too
hard
on
yourself
as
it
is
to
be
too
hard
on
other
folks
i
never
had
thought
o
that
before
child
but
i
thought
of
it
many
a
time
since
and
i
know
it
true
it
ai
often
you
find
a
human
bein
that
too
hard
on
himself
most
of
us
is
jest
the
other
way
but
mary
was
one
of
that
kind
i
could
see
a
change
come
over
her
face
while
i
was
talkin
and
i
always
believed
them
words
was
put
in
my
mouth
to
give
mary
the
comfort
and
help
she
needed
she
grabbed
hold
o
my
hand
and
says
she
you
reckon
i
got
a
right
to
forgive
myself
says
she
know
i
not
a
mean
woman
by
nature
but
harvey
ways
was
my
ways
he
made
me
do
things
i
did
want
to
do
and
say
things
i
did
want
to
say
and
i
never
was
myself
as
long
as
i
lived
with
him
but
god
knows
i
would
been
so
hard
on
him
if
i
only
known
says
she
may
forgive
me
but
even
if
he
does
it
do
seem
to
me
that
i
got
a
right
to
forgive
myself
and
says
i
if
you
do
forgive
yourself
you
wo
be
able
to
keer
for
the
children
and
you
have
got
any
right
to
wrong
the
livin
by
worryin
over
the
dead
and
now
says
i
lie
down
on
this
bed
and
shut
your
eyes
and
say
to
yourself
harvey
forgiven
me
and
god
forgiven
me
and
i
forgive
myself
do
let
another
thought
come
into
your
head
jest
say
it
over
and
over
till
you
go
to
sleep
and
while
you
sleepin
i
look
after
the
children
i
did
have
much
faith
in
my
own
remedy
but
she
minded
me
like
a
child
mindin
its
mother
and
sure
enough
when
i
tiptoed
an
hour
or
so
after
that
i
found
her
fast
asleep
her
mother
and
her
sister
sally
come
while
she
was
still
sleepin
and
i
left
for
home
feelin
that
she
was
in
good
hands
that
night
about
nine
i
went
outdoors
and
set
down
on
the
porch
steps
in
the
dark
as
i
always
do
jest
before
bedtime
that
been
one
o
my
ways
ever
since
i
was
a
child
abram
used
to
say
he
had
known
me
to
forgit
my
prayers
many
a
night
but
he
never
knew
me
to
forgit
to
go
outdoors
and
look
up
at
the
sky
if
there
was
a
moon
or
if
the
stars
was
shinin
i
stay
out
and
wander
around
in
the
gyarden
till
he
come
out
after
me
and
if
it
was
cloudy
i
set
there
and
feel
safe
in
the
darkness
as
in
the
light
i
always
have
thought
honey
that
we
lose
a
heap
by
sleepin
all
night
well
i
was
sittin
there
lookin
up
at
the
stars
and
all
at
once
i
saw
a
bright
light
over
in
the
direction
of
harvey
andrews
place
our
house
was
built
on
risin
ground
and
we
could
see
for
a
good
ways
around
the
country
i
called
abram
and
asked
him
if
he
had
better
saddle
old
moll
and
ride
over
and
see
if
he
could
help
whoever
was
in
trouble
but
he
said
it
was
most
likely
some
o
the
neighbors
burnin
brush
and
whatever
it
was
it
would
be
out
before
he
could
git
to
it
so
we
set
there
watchin
it
and
speculatin
about
it
till
it
died
down
and
then
we
went
to
bed
the
next
mornin
i
was
out
in
the
yard
weedin
out
a
bed
o
clove
pinks
and
sam
amos
come
ridin
by
on
his
big
bay
mare
i
hollered
to
him
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
the
fire
was
the
night
before
and
says
he
aunt
jane
it
was
that
old
cabin
on
harvey
place
he
said
that
amos
matthews
happened
to
be
goin
by
at
the
time
and
took
down
the
to
keep
it
from
spreadin
but
that
was
all
he
could
do
sam
said
amos
told
him
there
was
somethin
mysterious
about
that
fire
he
said
it
must
been
started
from
the
inside
for
the
flames
did
burst
through
the
windows
and
roof
till
after
he
got
there
and
the
whole
inside
was
ablaze
but
when
he
tried
to
open
the
door
it
was
locked
fast
and
tight
he
said
mary
and
her
mother
and
sister
was
all
out
in
the
yard
and
mary
was
standin
with
her
hands
folded
in
front
of
her
lookin
at
the
burnin
house
jest
as
calm
as
if
it
was
her
own
fireplace
amos
asked
her
for
the
key
to
the
cabin
door
and
she
went
to
the
back
porch
and
took
one
off
a
nail
but
it
would
fit
the
lock
and
before
she
could
get
another
to
try
the
roof
was
on
fire
and
cavin
in
amos
told
sam
the
cabin
appeared
to
be
full
of
old
plunder
of
all
sorts
and
you
could
smell
burnt
rags
for
a
mile
around
of
course
there
was
a
good
deal
o
talk
about
the
fire
and
everybody
said
how
curious
it
was
that
it
could
catch
on
the
inside
when
the
door
was
locked
i
never
said
a
word
not
even
to
abram
but
i
knew
well
enough
who
set
the
old
cabin
afire
and
why
the
key
mary
gave
amos
would
fit
the
lock
harvey
clothes
was
packed
away
under
the
old
garret
the
old
cabin
was
burned
and
the
ashes
and
rubbish
hauled
away
and
there
was
anything
much
left
to
remind
mary
of
the
things
she
was
tryin
to
forget
that
the
best
way
to
do
when
a
done
and
you
ca
undo
it
there
no
use
in
frettin
and
yourself
jest
put
it
out
o
your
mind
and
go
on
your
way
and
git
ready
for
the
next
trial
that
comin
to
you
but
mary
never
seemed
like
herself
after
harvey
died
until
little
harvey
was
taken
with
fever
that
seemed
to
rouse
her
and
bring
her
senses
back
and
she
nursed
him
night
and
day
the
little
thing
went
down
to
the
very
gates
of
death
and
everybody
give
up
hope
except
the
old
doctor
he
fight
death
off
as
long
as
there
was
breath
in
the
body
the
night
the
turnin
point
was
to
come
i
set
up
with
mary
the
child
been
moanin
and
tossin
and
his
muscles
was
twitchin
and
the
fever
jest
as
high
as
it
could
be
but
about
three
he
got
quiet
and
about
three
i
leaned
over
and
counted
his
breaths
he
was
breathin
slow
and
regular
and
i
touched
his
forehead
and
found
it
was
wet
and
the
fever
was
goin
away
i
went
over
to
mary
and
says
i
go
in
the
other
room
and
lie
down
mary
the
fever
broke
and
harvey
goin
to
git
well
she
stared
at
me
like
she
could
take
in
what
i
was
sayin
then
her
face
begun
to
work
like
a
person
in
a
convulsion
and
she
jumped
up
and
rushed
out
the
room
and
the
next
minute
she
give
a
cry
that
i
can
hear
yet
then
she
begun
to
sob
and
i
knew
she
was
cryin
tears
at
last
and
i
set
by
the
child
and
cried
with
her
she
was
able
to
be
up
for
two
or
three
days
and
every
little
while
she
burst
out
cryin
some
folks
said
she
was
cryin
for
joy
about
the
child
gittin
well
and
some
said
she
was
cryin
the
tears
she
ought
to
cried
when
harvey
was
buried
but
i
knew
she
was
cryin
over
all
the
sorrows
of
her
married
life
she
told
me
afterwards
that
she
had
shed
a
tear
for
six
or
seven
years
says
she
used
to
cry
my
eyes
out
nearly
over
the
way
things
went
and
one
day
somethin
happened
and
i
come
near
cryin
but
the
children
was
around
and
i
did
want
them
to
see
me
so
i
says
to
myself
i
wo
cry
what
the
use
wastin
tears
over
such
things
and
from
that
day
says
she
got
as
hard
as
a
stone
and
it
looks
like
i
was
jest
turnin
back
to
flesh
and
blood
again
there
only
two
ways
o
takin
trouble
child
you
can
laugh
over
it
or
you
can
cry
over
it
but
you
got
to
do
one
or
the
other
the
lord
made
some
folks
that
can
laugh
away
their
troubles
and
he
made
tears
for
them
that
ca
laugh
and
human
bein
ca
harden
themselves
into
stone
i
reckon
as
mary
said
nobody
on
earth
knew
what
she
been
through
livin
with
a
man
like
harvey
if
he
been
an
miser
it
would
been
better
for
everybody
concerned
but
it
looked
like
nature
started
out
to
make
him
a
miser
and
then
the
job
he
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
gold
was
there
and
he
showed
that
to
outsiders
and
the
clay
was
there
and
he
showed
that
to
mary
and
that
the
strangest
part
of
all
to
me
if
he
had
enough
sense
not
to
want
his
neighbors
to
know
his
meanness
it
looks
like
he
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
hide
it
from
his
wife
a
man
ought
to
want
his
wife
to
think
well
of
him
whether
anybody
else
does
or
not
you
see
a
woman
can
make
out
to
live
with
a
man
and
not
love
him
but
she
ca
live
with
him
and
despise
him
she
jest
got
to
respect
him
but
there
some
men
that
never
have
found
that
out
they
think
that
because
a
woman
stands
up
before
a
preacher
and
promises
to
love
and
honor
him
that
she
bound
to
do
it
no
matter
what
he
does
and
some
women
do
they
like
dogs
they
stick
to
a
man
no
matter
what
he
does
some
women
never
can
see
any
faults
in
their
husbands
and
some
sees
the
faults
and
covers
up
and
hides
from
outsiders
but
mary
was
that
sort
she
could
deceive
herself
and
nobody
could
deceive
her
and
when
she
found
out
harvey
meanness
she
could
help
despisin
him
in
her
heart
jest
like
michal
despised
david
when
she
saw
him
playin
and
dancin
before
the
lord
there
something
i
never
have
understood
and
one
of
is
why
such
a
woman
as
mary
should
been
permitted
to
marry
a
man
like
harvey
andrews
it
kind
o
shakes
my
faith
in
providence
every
time
i
think
of
it
but
i
reckon
there
was
a
reason
for
it
whether
i
can
see
it
or
not
aunt
jane
voice
ceased
she
dropped
her
knitting
in
her
lap
and
leaned
back
in
the
old
apparently
she
was
looking
at
the
dripping
syringa
bush
near
the
window
but
the
look
in
her
eyes
told
me
that
she
had
reached
a
page
in
the
story
that
was
not
for
my
eyes
or
my
ears
and
i
held
inviolate
the
silence
that
had
fallen
between
us
a
low
roll
of
thunder
the
last
note
of
the
roused
her
from
her
reverie
sakes
alive
child
she
exclaimed
starting
bolt
upright
have
i
been
sleepin
and
dreamin
and
you
settin
here
well
i
got
through
with
my
story
anyhow
before
i
dropped
off
surely
that
is
all
i
said
discontentedly
what
became
of
mary
andrews
after
harvey
died
aunt
jane
laughed
blithely
no
it
ai
all
what
gittin
into
me
to
leave
off
the
endin
of
a
story
mary
was
married
young
and
when
harvey
died
she
had
the
best
part
of
her
life
before
her
and
it
was
the
best
part
sure
enough
about
a
year
after
she
was
left
a
widow
she
went
up
to
christian
county
to
visit
some
of
her
cousins
and
there
she
met
the
man
she
ought
to
married
in
the
first
place
i
ai
any
hand
for
second
marriages
man
for
one
woman
says
i
but
i
seen
so
many
second
marriages
that
was
happier
than
any
first
ones
that
i
never
say
anything
against
marryin
twice
some
folks
are
made
for
each
other
but
they
make
mistakes
in
the
road
and
git
lost
and
do
git
found
till
they
been
through
a
heap
o
tribulation
and
maybe
the
biggest
half
o
their
life
gone
but
then
they
got
all
eternity
before
and
there
time
enough
there
to
find
all
they
lost
and
more
besides
but
mary
found
her
portion
o
happiness
before
it
was
too
late
elbert
madison
was
the
man
she
married
he
was
an
old
bachelor
and
a
mighty
man
and
they
said
every
old
maid
and
widow
in
christian
county
had
set
her
cap
for
him
one
time
or
another
but
whenever
folks
said
anything
to
him
about
marryin
say
waitin
for
the
right
woman
she
somewhere
in
the
world
and
as
soon
as
i
find
her
i
goin
to
marry
it
got
to
be
a
standin
joke
with
the
neighbors
and
the
family
and
his
brother
used
to
say
that
elbert
believed
in
that
woman
the
same
as
he
believed
in
god
they
used
to
tell
how
one
christmas
elbert
nieces
had
a
lot
young
company
from
louisville
and
they
had
a
big
dance
christmas
eve
elbert
was
there
and
the
minute
he
come
into
the
room
the
oldest
niece
she
whispered
uncle
elbert
he
come
to
see
if
the
right
woman
at
the
ball
and
with
that
all
them
gyirls
rushed
up
to
elbert
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
pulled
him
into
the
middle
o
the
room
under
a
big
bunch
o
mistletoe
and
the
prettiest
and
sassiest
one
of
she
took
her
dress
between
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
spread
it
out
and
made
a
low
bow
and
says
she
lookin
up
into
elbert
face
says
she
madison
do
i
look
like
the
right
woman
everybody
laughed
and
expected
to
see
elbert
blush
and
act
like
he
wanted
to
go
through
the
floor
but
instead
o
that
he
looked
at
her
serious
and
earnest
and
at
last
he
says
do
look
a
little
like
her
but
you
ai
her
you
got
the
color
of
her
eyes
says
he
not
the
look
of
her
hair
dark
like
yours
but
it
curl
quite
as
much
and
she
taller
than
you
are
but
not
quite
so
slim
they
said
the
gyirls
stopped
laughin
and
jest
looked
at
each
other
and
one
of
said
did
you
ever
and
that
was
the
last
time
they
tried
to
tease
elbert
but
elbert
brother
he
turns
to
somebody
standin
near
him
and
says
he
elbert
gets
that
foolishness
out
of
his
head
and
marries
and
settles
down
like
other
men
i
believe
end
his
days
in
a
lunatic
asylum
but
it
all
turned
out
the
way
elbert
said
it
would
the
minute
he
saw
mary
andrews
he
whispered
to
his
and
says
he
mary
do
you
see
that
woman
over
there
by
the
door
well
that
the
woman
i
been
lookin
for
all
my
life
he
walked
across
the
room
and
got
introduced
to
her
and
they
said
when
him
and
mary
shook
hands
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
and
laughed
like
two
old
friends
that
had
met
for
years
harvey
had
been
dead
much
over
a
year
and
mary
wanted
to
put
off
the
weddin
but
elbert
said
i
waited
for
you
a
lifetime
and
i
not
goin
to
wait
any
longer
so
they
got
married
as
soon
as
mary
could
have
her
weddin
clothes
made
and
a
happier
couple
you
never
saw
elbert
used
to
look
at
her
and
say
made
eve
for
adam
and
he
made
you
for
me
and
he
did
only
love
mary
but
he
loved
her
children
the
same
as
if
they
been
his
own
a
woman
that
been
another
man
wife
can
easy
enough
find
a
man
to
love
her
but
to
find
one
that
love
the
other
man
children
that
a
different
matter
one
two
three
four
chimed
the
old
clock
and
at
the
same
moment
out
came
the
sun
sending
long
rays
across
the
room
the
rain
had
subsided
to
a
gentle
mist
and
the
clouds
were
rolling
away
before
a
wind
that
carried
with
it
fragrance
from
wet
flowers
and
leaves
and
a
world
cleansed
and
renewed
by
a
summer
storm
we
moved
our
chairs
out
on
the
porch
to
enjoy
the
there
were
health
and
strength
in
every
breath
of
the
cool
moist
air
and
for
every
sense
but
one
a
pleasure
odor
light
coolness
and
the
faint
music
of
falling
water
from
the
roof
and
from
the
trees
that
sent
down
miniature
showers
whenever
the
wind
stirred
their
branches
aunt
jane
drew
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
and
looked
upward
at
the
blue
sky
i
do
mind
how
much
it
rains
durin
the
day
she
said
if
jest
stop
off
before
night
and
let
the
sun
set
clear
and
that
the
way
with
life
child
if
everything
ends
right
we
can
forget
all
about
the
troubles
we
had
before
i
reckon
if
mary
andrews
could
seen
a
few
years
ahead
while
she
was
havin
her
trials
with
pore
harvey
she
would
borne
all
with
a
better
grace
but
ahead
is
somethin
we
ai
permitted
to
do
we
jest
got
to
stand
up
under
the
present
and
trust
for
the
time
we
ca
see
and
whether
we
trust
or
not
child
no
matter
how
dark
it
is
nor
how
long
it
stays
dark
the
sun
goin
to
come
out
some
time
and
it
all
goin
to
be
right
at
the
last
you
know
what
the
scripture
says
evening
time
it
shall
be
light
her
faded
eyes
were
turned
reverently
toward
the
glory
of
the
western
sky
but
the
light
on
her
face
was
not
all
of
the
setting
sun
at
evening
time
it
shall
be
light
not
of
the
day
but
of
human
life
were
these
words
spoken
and
with
aunt
jane
the
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
ix
the
gardens
of
memory
illustration
each
of
us
has
his
own
way
of
classifying
humanity
to
me
as
a
child
men
and
women
fell
naturally
into
two
great
divisions
those
who
had
gardens
and
those
who
had
only
houses
brick
walls
and
pavements
hemmed
me
in
and
robbed
me
of
one
of
my
birthrights
and
to
the
fancy
of
childhood
a
garden
was
a
paradise
and
the
people
who
had
gardens
were
happy
adams
and
eves
walking
in
a
golden
mist
of
sunshine
and
showers
with
green
leaves
and
blue
sky
overhead
and
blossoms
springing
at
their
feet
while
those
others
dispossessed
of
life
springs
summers
and
autumns
appeared
darkly
entombed
in
shops
and
parlors
where
the
year
might
as
well
have
been
a
perpetual
winter
as
i
grew
older
i
learned
that
there
was
a
small
subclass
composed
of
people
who
not
only
possessed
gardens
but
whose
gardens
possessed
them
and
it
is
the
spots
sown
and
tended
by
these
that
blossom
eternally
in
one
remembrance
as
veritable
vailimas
gardens
of
dreams
in
every
one
mind
there
is
a
lonely
space
almost
abandoned
of
consciousness
the
time
between
infancy
and
childhood
it
is
like
that
period
when
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
was
upon
the
face
of
the
deep
here
like
lost
stars
floating
in
the
firmament
of
mind
will
be
found
two
or
three
faint
memories
remote
and
disconnected
with
me
one
of
these
memories
is
of
a
garden
i
was
riding
with
my
father
along
a
pleasant
country
road
there
were
sunshine
and
a
gentle
wind
and
white
clouds
in
a
blue
sky
we
stopped
at
a
gate
my
father
opened
it
and
i
walked
up
a
grassy
path
to
the
ruins
of
a
house
the
chimney
was
still
standing
but
all
the
rest
was
a
heap
of
blackened
rubbish
which
spring
and
summer
were
covering
with
wild
vines
and
weeds
and
around
the
ruins
of
the
house
lay
the
ruins
of
the
garden
the
honeysuckle
bereft
of
its
trellis
wandered
helplessly
over
the
ground
and
amid
a
rank
growth
of
weeds
sprang
a
host
of
yellow
snapdragons
i
remember
the
feeling
of
rapture
that
was
mine
at
the
thought
that
i
had
found
a
garden
where
flowers
could
be
gathered
without
asking
permission
of
any
one
and
as
long
as
i
live
the
sight
of
a
yellow
snapdragon
on
a
sunny
day
will
bring
back
my
father
from
his
grave
and
make
me
a
little
child
again
gathering
flowers
in
that
deserted
garden
which
is
seemingly
in
another
world
than
this
a
later
memory
than
this
is
of
a
place
that
was
scarcely
more
than
a
paved
court
lying
between
high
brick
walls
but
because
we
children
wanted
a
garden
so
much
we
called
it
by
that
name
and
here
and
there
a
little
of
mother
earth
bosom
left
uncovered
gave
us
some
warrant
for
the
misnomer
yet
the
spot
was
not
without
its
beauties
and
a
less
exacting
child
might
have
found
content
within
its
boundaries
here
was
the
indian
peach
tree
whose
pink
blossoms
told
us
that
spring
had
come
its
fruit
in
the
late
summer
was
like
the
pomegranate
in
its
rich
color
with
a
veined
humanity
and
its
friendly
limbs
held
a
swing
in
which
we
cleft
the
air
like
the
birds
yet
even
now
the
sight
of
an
indian
peach
brings
melancholy
thoughts
a
yellow
honeysuckle
clambered
over
a
wall
but
this
flower
has
no
perfume
and
a
honeysuckle
without
perfume
is
a
base
pretender
to
be
cast
out
of
the
family
of
the
real
honeysuckle
there
were
two
roses
of
similar
quality
one
that
detestable
mockery
known
as
the
i
have
for
this
flower
the
feeling
of
repulsion
that
one
has
for
certain
disagreeable
human
beings
people
with
cold
clammy
hands
for
instance
i
hated
its
feeble
pink
color
its
rough
calyx
and
its
odor
always
made
me
think
of
vast
fields
of
snow
and
icicles
hanging
from
roofs
under
leaden
wintry
skies
unhappy
mistake
to
call
such
a
thing
a
rose
and
plant
it
in
a
garden
the
only
place
where
it
might
fitly
grow
is
by
the
side
of
the
road
that
led
childe
roland
to
the
dark
tower
between
the
bit
of
stubbed
ground
and
the
marsh
near
to
the
palsied
oak
with
its
roots
set
in
the
bog
clay
and
rubble
sand
and
stark
black
dearth
the
other
rose
i
recall
with
the
same
dislike
though
it
was
pleasing
to
the
eye
the
bush
was
tall
and
had
the
nature
of
a
climber
for
it
drooped
in
a
lackadaisical
way
and
had
to
be
tied
to
a
stout
post
i
think
it
could
have
stood
upright
had
it
chosen
to
do
so
and
its
drooping
seemed
only
an
ugly
habit
without
grace
the
flowers
grew
in
clusters
and
the
buds
were
really
beautiful
but
color
and
form
are
only
the
body
of
the
rose
the
soul
the
real
self
is
the
rose
odor
and
no
was
incarnated
in
its
petals
again
and
again
deceived
by
its
beauty
i
would
hold
it
close
to
my
face
to
breathe
its
fragrance
and
always
its
faint
odor
brought
me
only
disappointment
and
disgust
it
was
a
lamia
among
roses
another
peculiarity
was
that
it
had
very
few
thorns
and
those
few
were
small
and
weak
yet
the
thorn
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
true
rose
as
its
sweetness
and
lacking
the
rose
thorn
and
the
rose
perfume
what
claim
had
it
to
the
rose
name
i
never
saw
this
false
rose
elsewhere
than
in
the
false
garden
and
because
it
grew
there
and
because
it
dishonored
its
royal
family
i
would
not
willingly
meet
it
face
to
face
again
we
children
cultivated
geraniums
in
pots
but
a
flower
in
a
pot
was
to
me
like
a
bird
in
a
cage
and
the
fragrant
geraniums
gave
me
no
more
pleasure
than
did
the
scentless
that
we
planted
in
tiny
borders
and
the
purple
flowering
beans
and
white
blossoms
of
the
madeira
vines
that
grew
on
a
tall
trellis
by
the
cistern
grassy
mound
there
was
nothing
here
to
satisfy
my
longing
and
i
turned
hungrily
to
other
gardens
whose
gates
were
open
to
me
in
those
early
days
in
one
of
these
was
a
vast
bed
of
purple
heartsease
flower
of
the
beautiful
name
year
after
year
they
had
blossomed
and
gone
to
seed
till
the
harvest
of
flowers
in
their
season
was
past
gathering
and
any
child
in
the
neighborhood
was
at
liberty
to
pluck
them
by
handfuls
while
the
wicked
ones
played
at
chicken
fighting
and
littered
the
ground
with
decapitated
bodies
there
is
no
heartsease
nowadays
only
the
magnificent
pansy
of
which
it
was
the
modest
forerunner
but
one
little
cluster
of
dark
spicy
blooms
like
those
i
used
to
gather
in
that
old
garden
would
be
more
to
me
than
the
most
splendid
pansy
created
by
the
florist
art
the
lily
of
the
valley
calls
to
mind
a
garden
almost
in
the
heart
of
town
where
this
flower
went
forth
to
possess
the
land
and
spread
itself
in
so
reckless
a
growth
that
at
intervals
it
had
to
be
uprooted
to
protect
the
landed
rights
of
the
rest
of
the
community
never
were
there
such
beds
of
lilies
and
when
they
pierced
the
black
loam
with
their
long
leaves
and
broke
their
alabaster
boxes
of
perfume
on
the
feet
of
spring
the
most
careless
was
forced
to
stay
his
steps
for
one
ecstatic
moment
to
look
and
to
breathe
to
forget
and
to
remember
the
shadow
of
the
owner
house
lay
on
this
garden
at
the
morning
hour
and
a
tall
brick
building
intercepted
its
share
of
the
afternoon
sunshine
but
the
love
and
care
of
the
wrinkled
old
woman
who
tended
it
took
the
place
of
real
sunshine
and
everything
planted
here
grew
with
a
luxuriance
not
seen
in
sunnier
and
more
favored
spots
the
mistress
of
the
garden
when
questioned
as
to
this
would
say
it
was
because
she
gave
her
flowers
to
all
who
asked
and
the
god
of
gardens
loved
the
cheerful
giver
and
blessed
her
with
an
abundance
of
bud
and
blossom
the
highest
philosophy
of
human
life
she
used
in
her
management
of
this
little
plant
world
for
burying
the
weeds
at
the
roots
of
the
flowers
the
evil
was
made
to
minister
to
the
good
and
the
nettle
the
plantain
and
all
their
kind
were
transmuted
by
nature
fine
chemistry
into
pinks
lilies
and
roses
the
purple
splendor
of
the
wisteria
recalls
the
garden
that
i
always
entered
with
a
fearful
joy
for
here
a
french
gardener
reigned
absolute
and
the
flowers
might
be
looked
at
but
not
pulled
how
different
from
those
wild
gardens
of
the
neighboring
woods
where
we
children
roamed
at
will
shouting
rapturously
over
the
finding
of
a
bed
of
scentless
blue
violets
or
delicate
anemones
that
withered
and
were
thrown
away
before
we
reached
home
an
allegory
alas
of
our
later
lives
there
was
one
garden
that
i
coveted
in
those
days
as
ahab
coveted
his
neighbor
vineyard
after
many
years
so
many
that
my
childish
longing
was
almost
forgotten
i
had
it
i
and
my
children
together
we
played
under
the
lindens
and
looked
at
the
sunset
through
the
scarlet
and
yellow
leaves
of
the
sugar
maples
and
i
learned
that
every
desire
is
the
prophecy
of
its
own
fulfilment
and
if
the
fulfilment
is
long
delayed
it
is
only
that
it
may
be
richer
and
deeper
when
it
does
come
all
these
were
gardens
of
the
south
but
before
childhood
was
over
i
watched
the
quick
luxuriant
growth
of
flowers
through
the
brief
summer
of
a
northern
clime
the
so
like
a
prim
pretty
maiden
the
dahlia
that
stately
dame
always
in
court
costume
of
gorgeous
velvet
remind
me
of
those
beds
where
not
a
leaf
or
flower
was
allowed
to
grow
awry
and
in
one
ancient
garden
the
imagination
of
a
child
found
wings
for
many
an
airy
flight
the
town
itself
bore
the
name
of
the
english
nobleman
well
known
in
revolutionary
days
not
far
away
his
mansion
sturdily
defied
the
touch
of
time
and
decay
and
admonished
the
men
of
a
degenerate
present
to
remember
their
glorious
past
the
house
that
sheltered
me
that
summer
was
known
in
colonial
days
as
the
tavern
its
walls
had
echoed
to
the
tread
of
patriot
and
tory
who
gathered
here
to
drink
a
health
to
general
washington
or
to
king
george
and
patriot
and
tory
too
had
trod
the
paths
of
the
garden
and
plucked
its
flowers
and
its
fruit
in
the
times
that
tried
men
souls
by
the
back
gate
grew
a
strawberry
apple
tree
and
every
morning
the
dewy
grass
held
a
windfall
of
the
tiny
red
apples
that
were
the
reward
of
the
child
who
rose
earliest
a
wonderful
grafted
tree
that
bore
two
kinds
of
fruit
gave
the
place
a
touch
of
fairyland
magic
and
no
explanation
of
the
process
of
grafting
ever
diminished
the
awe
i
felt
when
i
stood
under
this
tree
and
saw
ripe
spice
apples
growing
on
one
limb
and
green
winter
pearmains
on
all
the
others
the
pound
sweeting
the
spitzenberg
and
many
sister
apples
were
there
and
i
stayed
long
enough
to
see
them
ripen
into
perfection
while
they
ripened
i
gathered
the
clusters
of
red
and
white
currants
and
a
certain
rare
english
gooseberry
which
english
hands
had
brought
from
beyond
the
seas
and
planted
here
when
the
sign
of
the
swung
over
the
tavern
door
the
ordinary
gooseberry
is
a
plebeian
fruit
but
this
one
was
more
patrician
than
its
name
and
its
name
was
the
king
george
twice
as
large
as
the
common
kind
translucent
and
yellowish
white
when
fully
ripe
and
of
an
incomparable
sweetness
and
flavor
it
could
have
graced
a
king
table
and
held
its
own
with
the
delicate
strawberry
or
the
regal
grape
and
then
best
of
all
it
was
a
forbidden
fruit
whereof
we
children
ate
by
stealth
and
solemnly
declared
that
we
had
not
eaten
could
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
have
held
more
charms
at
the
end
of
the
long
dutch
stoop
i
found
the
wands
of
the
snowberry
whose
tiny
flowers
have
the
odor
and
color
of
the
trailing
arbutus
and
whose
waxen
berries
reminded
me
of
the
crimson
buckberry
of
southern
fields
fuchsias
and
clove
pinks
grew
in
a
peculiarly
rich
and
sunny
spot
by
the
back
fence
and
over
a
pot
of
the
i
used
to
hang
as
isabella
hung
over
her
pot
of
basil
i
had
never
seen
it
before
and
have
never
seen
it
since
but
by
the
witchery
of
perfume
one
of
its
yellow
flowers
one
of
its
soft
pale
green
leaves
could
place
me
again
in
that
garden
of
the
old
inn
a
child
walking
among
the
ghosts
and
memories
of
a
past
century
in
all
these
flowery
closes
there
are
rich
aftermaths
but
when
memory
goes
she
dwells
longest
on
the
evenings
and
mornings
once
spent
in
aunt
jane
garden
i
do
reckon
solomon
was
thinkin
about
flower
gyardens
when
he
said
there
was
a
time
for
all
things
aunt
jane
was
wont
to
say
but
anyhow
it
so
you
know
the
bible
says
that
the
lord
god
walked
in
the
gyarden
of
eden
in
cool
of
the
day
and
that
the
best
time
for
seein
flowers
the
cool
of
the
mornin
and
the
cool
of
the
evenin
there
jest
as
much
difference
between
a
flower
with
the
dew
on
it
at
and
a
flower
in
the
middle
o
the
day
as
there
is
between
a
woman
when
she
fresh
from
a
good
night
sleep
and
when
she
cookin
a
dinner
in
a
hot
kitchen
you
think
them
poppies
are
mighty
pretty
with
the
sun
shinin
on
but
the
poppy
ai
a
sun
flower
it
a
sunrise
flower
and
so
i
found
them
when
i
saw
them
in
the
faint
light
of
a
summer
dawn
delicate
and
tremulous
like
lovely
apparitions
of
the
night
that
an
hour
of
sun
will
dispel
with
other
flowers
the
miracle
of
blossoming
is
performed
so
slowly
that
we
have
not
time
to
watch
its
every
stage
there
is
no
precise
moment
when
the
rose
leaves
become
a
bud
or
when
the
bud
turns
to
a
flower
but
at
dawn
by
a
bed
of
poppies
you
may
watch
the
birth
of
a
flower
as
it
slips
from
the
calyx
casting
it
to
the
ground
as
a
soul
casts
aside
its
outgrown
body
and
smoothing
the
wrinkles
from
its
silken
petals
it
faces
the
day
in
serene
beauty
though
the
night
of
death
be
but
a
few
hours
away
and
some
evenin
when
the
moon
full
and
there
a
dew
fallin
continued
aunt
jane
that
the
time
to
see
roses
and
to
smell
roses
too
and
chrysanthemums
they
sundown
flowers
you
come
into
my
gyarden
about
the
first
o
next
november
child
some
evenin
when
the
sun
goin
down
and
you
see
the
white
ones
lookin
like
stars
and
the
yeller
ones
shinin
like
big
gold
lamps
in
the
dusk
and
when
the
last
light
o
the
sun
strikes
the
red
ones
they
look
like
cups
o
wine
and
some
of
turn
to
colors
that
there
ai
any
names
for
chrysanthemums
jest
match
the
red
and
yeller
leaves
on
the
trees
and
the
colors
you
see
in
the
sky
after
the
first
frosts
when
the
cold
weather
begins
to
set
in
yes
honey
there
a
time
and
a
season
for
everything
flowers
too
jest
as
solomon
said
an
old
garden
is
like
an
old
life
who
plants
from
youth
to
age
writes
a
record
of
the
years
in
leaf
and
blossom
and
the
spot
becomes
as
sacred
as
old
wine
old
books
and
old
friends
here
in
the
garden
of
aunt
jane
planting
i
found
that
flowers
were
also
memories
that
reminiscences
were
folded
in
the
petals
of
roses
and
lilies
that
a
rose
perfume
might
be
a
voice
from
a
vanished
summer
and
even
the
snake
gliding
across
our
path
might
prove
a
messenger
bearing
a
story
of
other
days
aunt
jane
made
a
pass
at
it
with
her
hoe
and
laughed
as
the
little
creature
disappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
i
never
see
a
striped
snake
she
said
that
i
do
think
o
sam
amos
and
the
time
he
saw
snakes
it
was
often
we
got
a
joke
on
sam
but
his
and
his
snake
kept
us
laughin
for
many
a
day
sam
was
one
o
them
big
blunderin
men
always
givin
milly
trouble
and
havin
trouble
himself
jest
through
pure
keerlessness
he
meant
well
and
milly
used
to
say
that
if
what
sam
did
was
even
half
as
good
as
what
sam
intended
to
do
there
be
one
perfect
man
on
earth
one
of
his
keerless
ways
was
scatterin
his
clothes
all
over
the
house
milly
scold
and
fuss
about
it
but
sam
got
worse
instead
o
better
up
to
the
day
he
saw
the
snake
and
after
that
milly
said
there
was
a
more
orderly
man
in
the
state
the
way
of
it
was
this
sam
was
raisin
an
embankment
one
of
his
ponds
and
uncle
jim
matthews
and
amos
crawford
was
helpin
him
it
was
one
monday
mornin
about
the
first
of
april
and
the
weather
was
warm
and
sunny
jest
the
kind
to
bring
out
snakes
i
reckon
there
never
was
anybody
hated
a
snake
as
much
as
sam
did
he
been
skeered
by
one
when
he
was
a
child
and
never
got
over
it
he
used
to
say
there
was
jest
two
things
he
was
afraid
of
milly
and
a
snake
that
mornin
uncle
jim
and
amos
got
to
the
pond
before
sam
did
and
uncle
jim
hollered
out
sam
we
beat
you
this
time
uncle
jim
never
got
tired
tellin
what
happened
next
he
said
sam
run
up
the
embankment
with
his
spade
and
set
it
in
the
ground
and
put
his
foot
on
it
to
push
it
down
the
next
minute
he
give
a
yell
that
you
could
heard
half
a
mile
slung
the
spade
over
in
the
middle
o
the
pond
jumped
three
feet
in
the
air
and
run
down
the
embankment
yellin
and
kickin
and
throwin
his
arms
about
in
every
direction
and
at
last
he
fell
down
on
the
ground
a
good
distance
from
the
pond
amos
and
uncle
jim
was
so
taken
by
surprise
at
first
that
they
jest
stood
still
and
looked
amos
says
says
he
man
gone
crazy
all
at
once
uncle
jim
says
havin
a
spell
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
used
to
have
them
spells
they
run
up
to
him
and
found
him
shakin
like
a
leaf
the
cold
sweat
streamin
out
of
every
pore
and
gaspin
and
sayin
it
away
take
it
away
and
all
the
time
he
was
throwin
out
his
left
foot
in
every
direction
finally
uncle
jim
grabbed
hold
of
his
foot
and
there
was
a
red
and
black
necktie
stickin
out
o
the
leg
of
his
pants
he
pulled
it
out
and
says
he
sam
what
your
sunday
necktie
up
your
pants
leg
they
said
sam
looked
at
it
in
a
foolish
sort
o
way
and
then
he
fell
back
laughin
and
cryin
at
the
same
time
jest
like
a
woman
and
it
was
five
minutes
or
more
before
they
could
stop
him
uncle
jim
brought
water
and
put
on
his
head
and
amos
fanned
him
with
his
hat
and
at
last
they
got
him
in
such
a
fix
that
he
could
sit
up
and
talk
and
says
he
took
off
my
necktie
last
night
and
slung
it
down
on
a
chair
where
my
everyday
pants
was
layin
when
i
put
my
foot
in
my
pants
this
mornin
i
must
carried
the
necktie
inside
and
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
pond
it
worked
down
and
i
thought
it
was
a
black
snake
with
red
stripes
he
started
to
git
up
but
his
ankle
was
sprained
and
uncle
jim
says
wonder
sam
you
jumped
about
six
feet
when
you
saw
that
snake
crawlin
out
o
your
pants
leg
and
sam
says
feet
i
know
i
jumped
six
hundred
feet
uncle
jim
well
they
got
him
to
the
house
and
told
milly
about
it
and
she
says
sam
i
too
sorry
for
you
to
laugh
at
you
like
uncle
jim
but
i
must
say
this
would
happened
if
you
folded
up
that
necktie
and
put
it
away
in
the
top
drawer
sam
was
settin
on
the
side
of
the
bed
rubbin
his
ankle
and
he
give
a
groan
and
says
he
has
come
to
a
fine
pass
in
kentucky
when
a
sober
man
like
me
has
to
put
his
necktie
in
the
top
drawer
to
keep
from
seein
snakes
i
declare
to
goodness
laughed
aunt
jane
as
she
laid
down
her
trowel
and
pushed
back
her
calico
sunbonnet
if
i
never
heard
anything
funny
again
in
this
world
i
could
keep
on
laughin
till
i
died
jest
over
things
i
ricollect
the
trouble
is
there
ai
always
anybody
around
to
laugh
with
me
sam
amos
ai
nothin
but
a
name
to
you
child
but
to
me
he
jest
as
real
as
if
he
had
been
dead
these
many
years
and
i
can
laugh
over
the
things
he
used
to
do
the
same
as
if
they
happened
yesterday
only
a
name
and
i
had
read
it
on
a
stone
in
the
old
but
as
i
walked
home
through
the
twilight
i
would
hardly
have
been
startled
if
sam
amos
in
the
pride
of
life
had
come
riding
past
me
on
his
bay
mare
or
if
uncle
jim
matthews
voice
of
cheerful
discord
had
mingled
with
the
spring
song
of
the
frogs
sounding
from
every
marsh
and
pond
it
was
aunt
jane
motto
that
wherever
a
weed
would
grow
a
flower
would
grow
and
carrying
out
this
principle
of
planting
her
garden
was
continually
extending
its
boundaries
and
denizens
of
the
garden
proper
were
to
be
found
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
her
domain
in
the
spring
you
looked
for
grass
only
and
lo
starting
up
at
your
feet
like
the
unexpected
joys
of
life
came
the
golden
daffodil
the
paler
narcissus
the
purple
iris
and
the
red
and
yellow
tulip
flourishing
as
bravely
as
in
the
soil
of
its
native
holland
and
for
a
few
sunny
weeks
the
front
yard
would
be
a
great
flower
garden
then
blossom
and
leaf
would
fade
and
you
might
walk
all
summer
over
the
velvet
grass
never
knowing
how
much
beauty
and
fragrance
lay
hidden
in
the
darkness
of
the
earth
but
when
i
go
back
to
aunt
jane
garden
i
pass
through
the
front
yard
and
the
back
yard
between
rows
of
lilac
syringas
calycanthus
and
honeysuckle
i
open
the
rickety
gate
and
find
myself
in
a
genuine
garden
the
homely
inclusive
spot
that
welcomed
all
growing
things
to
its
hospitable
bounds
type
of
the
days
when
there
were
no
impassable
barriers
of
gold
and
caste
between
man
and
his
brother
man
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
stood
a
or
arbor
whose
crumbling
timbers
were
knit
together
by
interlacing
branches
of
honeysuckle
and
running
roses
the
had
four
entrances
opening
on
four
paths
that
divided
the
ground
into
occupied
by
vegetables
and
small
fruits
and
around
these
like
costly
embroidery
on
the
hem
of
a
homespun
garment
ran
a
wide
border
of
flowers
that
blossomed
from
early
april
to
late
november
shifting
from
one
beauty
to
another
as
each
flower
had
its
little
day
there
are
who
love
some
flowers
and
other
who
love
all
flowers
aunt
jane
was
of
the
latter
class
the
commonest
plant
striving
in
its
own
humble
way
to
be
sweet
and
beautiful
was
sure
of
a
place
here
and
the
haughtiest
aristocrat
who
sought
admission
had
to
lay
aside
all
pride
of
place
or
birth
and
acknowledge
her
kinship
with
common
humanity
the
bourbon
rose
could
not
hold
aside
her
skirts
from
contact
with
the
the
lavender
could
not
disdain
the
companionship
of
sage
and
thyme
all
must
live
together
in
the
concord
of
a
perfect
democracy
then
if
the
great
gardener
bestowed
rain
and
sunshine
when
they
were
needed
days
would
show
a
glorious
symphony
of
color
around
the
gray
farmhouse
and
through
the
enchantment
of
bloom
and
fragrance
flitted
an
old
woman
whose
dark
eyes
glowed
with
the
joy
of
living
and
the
joy
of
remembering
all
life
other
summers
to
aunt
jane
every
flower
in
the
garden
was
a
human
thing
with
a
life
story
and
close
to
the
grew
one
historic
rose
heroine
of
an
old
romance
to
which
i
listened
one
day
as
we
sat
in
the
arbor
where
hundreds
of
honeysuckle
blooms
were
trumpeting
their
fragrance
on
the
air
grandmother
rose
child
that
all
the
name
it
got
she
said
in
answer
to
my
question
i
reckon
you
think
a
rose
like
that
ought
to
have
a
name
but
i
never
saw
anybody
yet
that
knew
enough
about
roses
to
tell
what
its
right
name
is
maybe
when
i
dead
and
gone
somebody
tack
a
french
name
on
to
it
but
as
long
as
it
grows
in
my
gyarden
it
be
jest
grandmother
rose
and
this
is
how
it
come
by
the
name
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
was
amongst
the
first
settlers
of
kentucky
they
come
from
the
old
dominion
over
the
wilderness
road
way
back
yonder
goodness
knows
when
did
you
ever
think
child
how
curious
it
was
for
them
men
to
leave
their
homes
and
risk
their
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
their
little
children
and
their
wives
jest
to
git
to
a
new
country
it
appears
to
me
they
must
been
led
jest
like
columbus
was
when
he
crossed
the
big
ocean
in
his
little
ships
i
reckon
if
the
women
and
children
had
had
their
way
about
it
the
bears
and
wildcats
and
indians
would
be
here
yet
but
a
man
goes
where
he
pleases
and
a
woman
got
to
foller
and
that
the
way
it
was
with
grandfather
and
grandmother
i
heard
mother
say
that
grandmother
cried
for
a
week
when
she
found
she
had
to
go
and
every
now
and
then
she
sob
out
would
mind
it
so
much
if
i
could
take
my
gyarden
when
they
began
packin
up
their
things
grandmother
took
up
this
rose
and
put
it
in
an
iron
kittle
and
laid
plenty
of
good
rich
earth
around
the
roots
grandfather
said
the
load
they
had
to
carry
was
heavy
enough
without
puttin
in
any
useless
things
but
grandmother
says
says
she
you
leave
this
rose
behind
you
can
leave
me
too
so
the
kittle
and
the
rose
went
four
weeks
they
was
on
their
way
and
every
time
they
come
to
a
creek
or
a
river
or
a
spring
grandmother
water
her
rose
and
when
they
got
to
their
journey
end
before
they
ever
chopped
a
tree
or
laid
a
stone
or
broke
ground
she
cut
the
sod
with
an
axe
and
then
she
took
grandfather
huntin
knife
and
dug
a
hole
and
planted
her
rose
grandfather
cut
some
limbs
off
a
beech
tree
and
drove
into
the
ground
all
around
it
to
keep
it
from
bein
tramped
down
and
when
that
was
done
grandmother
says
build
the
house
so
this
stand
on
the
side
o
the
front
walk
maybe
i
wo
die
of
homesickness
if
i
can
set
on
my
front
and
see
one
flower
from
my
old
virginia
gyarden
well
grandmother
did
die
of
homesickness
nor
the
rose
either
the
transplantin
was
good
for
both
of
she
lived
to
be
ninety
years
old
and
when
she
died
the
house
would
hold
the
children
and
grandchildren
and
that
come
to
the
funeral
and
here
her
rose
growin
and
bloomin
yet
like
there
was
any
such
things
in
the
world
as
old
age
and
death
and
every
spring
i
gether
a
basketful
o
these
pink
roses
and
lay
on
her
grave
over
yonder
in
the
old
some
folks
has
family
china
and
family
silver
that
they
mighty
proud
of
martha
crawford
used
to
have
a
big
blue
and
white
bowl
that
belonged
to
her
and
she
thought
more
o
that
bowl
than
she
did
of
everything
else
in
the
house
milly
amos
had
a
set
spoons
that
been
in
her
family
for
four
generations
and
was
too
precious
to
use
and
i
got
my
family
rose
and
it
jest
as
dear
to
me
as
china
and
silver
are
to
other
folks
i
ricollect
after
father
died
and
the
estate
had
to
be
divided
up
and
sister
mary
and
brother
joe
and
the
rest
of
was
layin
claim
to
the
mahogany
table
and
the
old
secretary
and
mother
cherry
sideboard
and
such
things
as
that
and
brother
joe
turned
around
and
says
to
me
says
he
there
anything
you
want
jane
if
there
is
speak
up
and
make
it
known
and
i
says
rest
of
you
can
take
what
you
want
of
the
furniture
and
if
there
anything
left
that
can
be
my
part
if
there
ai
anything
left
there
be
no
quarrelin
for
there
jest
one
thing
i
want
and
that
grandmother
rose
they
all
laughed
and
sister
mary
says
that
jest
like
jane
and
brother
joe
says
says
he
shall
have
it
jane
and
further
than
that
i
see
to
the
transplantin
that
very
evenin
he
come
over
and
i
showed
him
where
i
wanted
the
rose
to
stand
he
dug
down
into
the
clay
there
nothin
a
rose
likes
better
child
than
good
red
clay
and
got
a
wheelbarrer
load
soil
from
the
woods
and
we
put
that
in
first
and
set
the
roots
in
it
and
packed
good
and
firm
first
with
woods
soil
then
with
clay
waterin
it
all
the
time
when
we
got
through
i
says
you
pretty
thing
you
if
you
could
come
all
the
way
from
virginia
in
a
old
iron
kittle
you
surely
wo
mind
bein
moved
from
father
place
to
mine
now
you
got
to
live
and
bloom
for
me
same
as
you
did
for
mother
you
need
laugh
child
that
rose
knew
jest
what
i
said
and
did
jest
what
i
told
it
to
do
it
looked
like
everything
favored
us
for
it
was
early
in
the
spring
things
was
beginnin
to
put
out
leaves
and
the
next
day
was
cloudy
and
cool
then
it
began
to
rain
and
rained
for
hours
right
along
and
when
the
sun
come
out
grandmother
rose
come
out
too
not
a
leaf
on
it
ever
withered
and
me
and
my
children
and
my
children
children
have
gethered
flowers
from
it
all
these
years
folks
say
i
foolish
about
it
and
i
reckon
i
am
i
outlived
most
o
the
people
i
love
but
i
do
want
to
outlive
this
rose
we
both
weathered
many
a
hard
winter
and
two
or
three
times
it
been
clean
to
the
ground
and
i
thought
i
lost
it
honey
it
was
like
losin
a
child
but
there
never
been
a
winter
yet
hard
enough
to
kill
the
life
in
that
rose
root
and
i
trust
there
never
will
be
while
i
live
for
spring
would
be
spring
to
me
without
grandmother
rose
tall
straight
and
strong
it
stood
this
oft
transplanted
pilgrim
rose
and
whether
in
bloom
or
clothed
only
in
its
rich
green
foliage
you
saw
at
a
glance
that
it
was
a
flower
of
royal
lineage
when
spring
covered
it
with
buds
and
full
blown
blossoms
of
pink
the
true
rose
color
it
spoke
of
queens
gardens
and
kings
palaces
and
every
satiny
petal
was
a
palimpsest
of
song
and
legend
its
perfume
was
the
scent
like
that
of
the
roses
of
india
it
satisfied
and
satiated
with
its
rich
potency
and
breathing
this
odor
and
gazing
into
its
deep
wells
of
color
you
had
strange
dreams
of
those
other
pilgrims
who
left
home
and
friends
and
journeyed
through
the
perils
of
a
trackless
wilderness
to
plant
still
farther
westward
the
rose
of
civilization
to
aunt
jane
there
were
three
epochs
in
a
garden
life
daffodil
time
rose
time
and
chrysanthemum
time
and
the
blossoming
of
all
other
flowers
would
be
chronicled
under
one
of
these
periods
just
as
we
say
of
historical
events
that
they
happened
in
the
reign
of
this
or
that
queen
or
empress
but
this
garden
had
all
seasons
for
its
own
and
even
in
winter
there
was
a
deep
pleasure
in
walking
its
paths
and
noting
how
bravely
life
struggled
against
death
in
the
frozen
bosom
of
the
earth
i
once
asked
her
which
flower
she
loved
best
it
was
daffodil
time
and
every
gold
cup
held
nepenthe
for
the
nightmare
dream
of
winter
she
glanced
reprovingly
at
me
over
her
spectacles
it
appears
to
me
child
you
ought
to
know
that
without
askin
she
said
did
you
ever
see
as
many
daffydils
in
one
place
before
no
and
you
never
will
i
been
plantin
that
flower
every
spring
for
sixty
years
and
i
never
got
too
many
of
yet
i
used
to
call
till
henrietta
told
me
that
their
right
name
was
daffydil
but
suits
best
for
it
kind
o
tells
how
they
come
up
in
the
spring
the
hyacinths
and
tulips
they
hang
back
till
they
know
it
be
warm
and
comfortable
outside
but
these
daffydils
do
wait
for
anything
before
the
snow
gone
you
see
their
leaves
pushin
up
through
the
cold
ground
and
the
buds
come
hurryin
along
tryin
to
keep
up
with
the
leaves
jest
like
they
knew
that
little
children
and
old
women
like
me
was
waitin
and
longin
for
why
i
seen
these
flowers
bloomin
and
the
snow
fallin
over
in
march
and
they
did
mind
it
a
bit
i
got
my
start
daffydils
from
mother
gyarden
and
every
fall
i
divide
the
roots
up
and
scatter
out
till
i
got
the
whole
place
pretty
well
sprinkled
with
but
the
biggest
part
of
come
from
the
old
harris
farm
three
or
four
miles
down
the
pike
forty
years
ago
that
farm
was
sold
and
the
man
that
bought
it
tore
things
up
scandalous
he
called
it
remodelin
i
ricollect
but
it
looked
more
like
to
me
old
lady
harris
was
like
myself
she
could
git
enough
of
these
yeller
flowers
she
had
a
double
row
of
all
around
her
gyarden
and
they
even
gone
through
the
fence
and
come
up
in
the
cornfield
and
who
ever
plowed
that
field
had
to
be
careful
not
to
touch
them
daffydils
well
as
soon
as
the
new
man
got
possession
he
begun
plowin
up
the
gyarden
and
one
evenin
the
news
come
to
me
that
he
was
throwin
away
by
the
i
put
on
my
sunbonnet
and
went
out
where
abram
was
at
work
in
the
field
and
says
i
you
got
to
stop
plowin
and
put
the
horse
to
the
spring
wagon
and
take
me
over
to
the
old
harris
place
and
abram
says
says
he
jane
like
mighty
well
to
finish
this
field
before
night
for
it
looks
like
it
might
rain
is
it
anything
particular
you
want
to
go
for
says
i
i
never
was
so
particular
about
anything
in
my
life
as
i
am
about
this
i
hear
they
plowin
up
old
lady
harris
gyarden
and
throwin
the
flowers
away
and
i
want
to
go
over
and
git
a
o
abram
looked
at
me
a
minute
like
he
thought
i
was
losin
my
senses
and
then
he
burst
out
laughin
and
says
he
who
ever
heard
of
a
farmer
stoppin
plowin
to
go
after
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
farmer
wife
askin
him
to
do
such
a
thing
i
walked
up
to
the
plow
and
begun
to
unfasten
the
trace
chains
and
says
i
before
pleasure
abram
if
it
goin
to
rain
that
all
the
more
reason
why
i
ought
to
have
my
set
out
the
plowin
can
wait
till
we
come
back
of
course
abram
give
in
when
he
saw
how
i
wanted
the
flowers
but
he
broke
out
laughin
two
or
three
times
while
he
was
hitchin
up
and
says
he
tell
any
o
the
neighbors
jane
that
i
stopped
plowin
to
go
after
a
load
of
when
we
got
to
the
harris
place
we
found
the
lyin
in
a
gully
by
the
side
o
the
road
a
pitiful
sight
to
anybody
that
loves
flowers
and
understands
their
feelin
we
loaded
up
the
wagon
with
the
pore
things
and
as
soon
as
we
got
home
abram
took
his
hoe
and
made
a
little
trench
all
around
the
gyarden
and
i
set
out
the
while
abram
finished
his
plowin
and
the
next
day
the
rain
fell
on
abram
cornfield
and
on
my
flowers
do
you
see
that
row
o
daffydils
over
yonder
by
the
front
fence
child
all
leaves
and
no
blossoms
i
looked
in
the
direction
of
her
pointing
finger
and
saw
a
long
line
of
flowerless
plants
standing
like
sad
and
silent
guests
at
the
festival
of
spring
it
been
six
years
since
i
set
out
there
said
aunt
jane
impressively
and
not
a
flower
have
they
had
in
all
that
time
some
folks
say
it
because
i
moved
at
the
wrong
time
o
the
year
but
the
same
week
i
moved
these
i
moved
some
from
my
yard
to
elizabeth
crawford
and
elizabeth
bloom
every
year
so
it
ca
be
that
some
folks
said
the
place
i
had
in
was
too
shady
and
i
put
right
out
there
where
the
sun
strikes
on
till
it
sets
and
still
they
wo
bloom
it
my
opinion
honey
that
they
jest
homesick
i
believe
if
i
was
to
take
them
daffydils
back
to
aunt
matilda
and
plant
in
the
border
where
they
used
to
grow
alongside
o
the
sage
and
lavender
and
thyme
that
they
go
to
bloomin
again
jest
like
they
used
to
you
know
how
the
children
of
israel
pined
and
mourned
when
they
was
carried
into
captivity
well
every
time
i
look
at
my
daffydils
i
think
o
them
homesick
israelites
askin
can
we
sing
the
songs
o
zion
in
a
strange
land
you
need
laugh
child
a
flower
is
jest
as
human
as
you
and
me
look
at
that
vine
yonder
takin
hold
of
everything
that
comes
in
its
way
like
a
little
child
learnin
to
walk
and
calycanthus
buds
see
how
you
got
to
hold
in
your
hands
and
warm
before
give
out
their
sweetness
jest
like
children
that
you
got
to
love
and
pet
before
they
let
you
git
acquainted
with
you
see
that
pink
rose
over
by
the
fence
pointing
to
a
la
france
heavy
with
blossoms
well
that
rose
did
do
anything
but
put
out
leaves
the
first
two
years
i
had
it
a
bud
might
come
once
in
a
while
but
it
would
blast
before
it
was
half
open
and
at
last
i
says
to
it
says
i
is
it
you
want
honey
there
somethin
that
do
please
you
i
know
do
you
like
the
place
you
planted
in
and
the
hollyhocks
and
lilies
for
neighbors
and
one
day
i
took
it
up
and
set
it
between
that
white
tea
and
another
la
france
and
it
went
to
bloomin
right
away
it
did
like
the
neighborhood
it
was
in
you
see
and
did
you
ever
hear
o
people
disappearin
from
their
homes
and
never
found
any
more
well
flowers
can
disappear
the
same
way
the
year
before
i
was
married
there
was
a
big
bed
o
pink
chrysanthemums
growin
under
the
windows
at
old
pendleton
it
was
a
common
magenta
pink
it
was
as
clear
pretty
a
pink
as
that
la
france
rose
well
i
saw
that
fall
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
the
next
year
there
was
any
and
when
i
asked
where
gone
to
nobody
could
tell
anything
about
and
ever
since
then
i
been
searchin
in
every
old
gyarden
in
the
county
but
i
never
found
and
i
do
reckon
i
ever
will
and
there
my
roses
just
look
at
every
color
a
rose
could
be
and
pretty
near
every
kind
there
is
would
you
think
i
be
satisfied
but
there
a
rose
i
lost
sixty
years
ago
and
the
ricollection
o
that
rose
keeps
me
from
bein
satisfied
with
all
got
it
grew
in
old
lady
elrod
gyarden
and
nowhere
else
and
there
ai
a
rose
here
except
grandmother
that
i
would
give
up
forever
if
i
could
jest
find
that
rose
again
i
tried
many
a
time
to
tell
folks
about
that
rose
but
i
somehow
get
hold
of
the
words
i
reckon
an
old
woman
like
me
with
little
or
no
learnin
could
be
expected
to
tell
how
that
rose
looked
any
she
could
be
expected
to
draw
it
and
paint
it
i
can
say
it
was
yeller
but
that
word
do
tell
the
color
the
rose
was
i
got
all
the
shades
of
yeller
in
my
garden
but
like
the
color
o
that
rose
it
got
deeper
and
deeper
towards
the
middle
and
lookin
at
one
of
them
roses
was
like
down
into
a
gold
mine
the
leaves
crinkled
and
curled
back
towards
the
stem
as
fast
as
it
opened
and
the
more
it
opened
the
prettier
it
was
like
some
women
that
grow
better
lookin
the
older
they
grow
mary
andrews
was
one
kind
and
when
it
comes
to
tellin
you
how
it
smelt
i
jest
have
to
stop
there
never
was
anything
like
it
for
sweetness
and
it
was
a
different
sweetness
from
any
other
rose
god
ever
made
i
ricollect
seein
miss
penelope
come
in
church
one
sunday
dressed
in
white
with
a
black
velvet
gyirdle
her
waist
and
a
bunch
these
roses
buds
and
ones
and
ones
fastened
in
the
gyirdle
and
that
bunch
o
yeller
roses
was
song
and
sermon
and
prayer
to
me
that
day
i
could
take
my
eyes
off
and
i
thought
that
if
christ
had
seen
that
rose
growin
in
the
fields
around
palestine
he
would
mentioned
lilies
when
he
said
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
these
i
always
intended
to
ask
for
a
slip
of
it
but
i
waited
too
long
it
got
lost
one
winter
and
when
i
asked
old
lady
elrod
about
it
she
said
parrish
i
can
not
tell
you
whence
it
came
nor
whither
it
went
the
old
lady
always
used
mighty
pretty
language
well
honey
them
two
lost
flowers
jest
haunt
me
they
like
dead
children
you
know
a
house
may
be
full
o
livin
children
but
if
there
one
dead
a
mother
see
its
face
and
hear
its
voice
above
all
the
others
and
that
the
way
with
my
lost
flowers
no
matter
how
many
roses
and
chrysanthemums
i
have
i
keep
seein
old
lady
yeller
roses
danglin
from
miss
penelope
gyirdle
and
that
bed
pink
chrysanthemums
under
pendleton
windows
each
mortal
has
his
carcassonne
here
was
aunt
jane
but
it
was
no
matter
for
a
tear
or
even
a
sigh
and
i
thought
how
the
sting
of
life
would
lose
its
venom
if
for
every
soul
the
unattainable
were
embodied
in
nothing
more
embittering
than
two
exquisite
lost
flowers
one
afternoon
in
early
june
i
stood
with
aunt
jane
in
her
garden
it
was
the
time
of
roses
and
in
the
midst
of
their
opulent
bloom
stood
the
tall
white
lilies
handmaidens
to
the
queen
here
and
there
over
the
warm
earth
pinks
spread
their
on
which
a
worshiper
might
kneel
and
offer
thanks
for
life
and
spring
and
towering
over
all
rows
of
hollyhocks
flamed
and
glowed
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
like
the
stained
glass
windows
of
some
old
cathedral
across
the
flowery
expanse
aunt
jane
looked
wistfully
toward
the
evening
skies
beyond
whose
stars
and
clouds
we
place
that
other
world
called
heaven
i
like
my
grandmother
child
she
said
presently
i
know
i
got
to
leave
this
country
some
day
soon
and
journey
to
another
one
and
the
only
thing
i
mind
about
it
is
givin
up
my
gyarden
when
john
looked
into
heaven
he
saw
gold
streets
and
gates
of
pearl
but
he
do
say
anything
about
gyardens
i
like
what
he
says
about
no
sorrer
nor
cryin
nor
pain
and
god
wipin
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
that
pure
comfort
but
if
i
could
jest
have
abram
and
the
children
again
and
my
old
home
and
my
old
gyarden
i
be
willin
to
give
up
the
gold
streets
and
glass
sea
and
pearl
gates
the
loves
of
earth
and
the
homes
of
earth
no
apocalyptic
vision
can
come
between
these
and
the
human
heart
life
is
said
to
have
begun
in
a
garden
and
if
here
was
our
lost
paradise
may
not
the
paradise
we
hope
to
gain
through
death
be
to
the
lover
of
nature
another
garden
in
a
new
earth
girdled
by
four
rivers
and
watered
by
mists
that
arise
in
the
night
to
fall
on
the
face
of
the
sleeping
world
where
all
we
plant
shall
grow
unblighted
through
winterless
years
and
they
who
inherit
it
go
with
white
garments
and
shining
faces
and
say
at
morn
and
noon
and
eve
soul
is
like
a
watered
garden
