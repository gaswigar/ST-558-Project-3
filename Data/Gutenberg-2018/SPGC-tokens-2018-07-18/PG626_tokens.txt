thou
a

when
thou

preface
the
author
of
the
book
richard
de
bury
so
called
from
being
born
near
bury
edmunds
was
the
son
of
sir
richard
aungerville
he
studied
at
oxford
and
was
subsequently
chosen
to
be
tutor
to
prince
edward
of
windsor
afterwards
edward
iii
his
loyalty
to
the
cause
of
queen
isabella
and
the
prince
involved
him
in
danger
on
the
accession
of
his
pupil
he
was
made
successively
cofferer
treasurer
of
the
wardrobe
archdeacon
of
northampton
prebendary
of
lincoln
sarum
and
lichfield
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
ambassador
on
two
occasions
to
pope
john
xxii
who
appointed
him
a
chaplain
of
the
papal
chapel
dean
of
wells
and
ultimately
at
the
end
of
the
year
bishop
of
durham
the
king
and
queen
the
king
of
scots
and
all
the
magnates
north
of
the
trent
together
with
a
multitude
of
nobles
and
many
others
were
present
at
his
enthronization
it
is
noteworthy
that
during
his
stay
at
avignon
probably
in
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
petrarch
who
has
left
us
a
brief
account
of
their
intercourse
in
richard
visited
cambridge
as
one
of
the
king
commissioners
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
the
king
scholars
there
and
perhaps
then
became
a
member
of
the
gild
of
mary
one
of
the
two
gilds
which
founded
corpus
christi
college
in
he
became
high
chancellor
of
england
and
treasurer
in
resigning
the
former
office
in
so
that
he
might
help
the
king
in
dealing
with
affairs
abroad
and
in
scotland
and
took
a
most
distinguished
part
in
diplomatic
negociations
between
england
and
france
in
he
was
again
in
his
bishopric
thereafter
his
name
occurs
often
among
those
appointed
to
treat
of
peace
with
philip
of
france
and
with
bruce
of
scotland
it
appears
that
he
was
not
in
parliament
in
wasted
by
long
sickness

on
the
of
april
richard
de

died
at
auckland
and
was
buried

the
bishop
as
booklover
according
to
the
concluding
note
the
philobiblon
was
completed
on
the
bishop
birthday
the
of
january
so
that
even
though
weakened
by
illness
richard
must
have
been
actively
engaged
in
his
literary
efforts
to
the
very
end
of
his
generous
and
noble
life
his
enthusiastic
devoted
biographer
chambre
gives
a
vivid
account
of
the
bishop
bookloving
propensities
supplementary
to
what
can
be
gathered
from
the
philobiblon
itself
iste
summe
delectabatur
in
multitudine
librorum
he
had
more
books
as
was
commonly
reported
than
all
the
other
english
bishops
put
together
he
had
a
separate
library
in
each
of
his
residences
and
wherever
he
was
residing
so
many
books
lay
about
his
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
stand
or
move
without
treading
upon
them
all
the
time
he
could
spare
from
business
was
devoted
either
to
religious
offices
or
to
his
books
every
day
while
at
table
he
would
have
a
book
read
to
him
unless
some
special
guest
were
present
and
afterwards
would
engage
in
discussion
on
the
subject
of
the
reading
the
haughty
anthony
bec
delighted
in
the
appendages
of
royalty
to
be
addressed
by
nobles
kneeling
and
to
be
waited
on
in
his
and
at
his
table
by
knights
and
standing
but
de
bury
loved
to
surround
himself
with
learned
scholars
among
these
were
such
men
as
thomas
bradwardine
afterwards
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
author
of
the
de

richard
fitzralph
afterwards
archbishop
of
armagh
and
famous
for
his
hostility
to
the
mendicant
orders
walter
burley
who
dedicated
to
him
a
translation
of
the
politics
of
aristotle
made
at
his
suggestion
john

robert

an
unsuccessful
attempt
has
been
made
to
transfer
the
authorship
of
the
book
to
robert
holkot
various
theories
have
been
advanced
against
richard
claims
it
is
noteworthy
that
his
contemporary
adam
murimuth
disparages
him
as
mediocriter
literatus
volens
tamen
magnus
clericus
reputari
but
such
disparagement
must
be
taken
with
the
utmost
caution
the
really
difficult
fact
to
be
accounted
for
is
the
omission
on
the
part
of
chambre
to
mention
the
book
the
bishop
books
in
the
philobiblon
richard
de
bury
frankly
and
clearly
describes
his
means
and
method
of
collecting
books
anyhow
his
object
was
clearly
not
selfish
the
treatise
contains
his
rules
for
the
library
of
the
new
college
at
oxford
durham
college
where
trinity
college
now
stands
which
he
practically
founded
though
his
successor
bishop
hatfield
carried
the
scheme
into
effect
it
is
traditionally
reported
that
richard
books
were
sent
in
his
lifetime
or
after
his
death
to
the
house
of
the
durham
benedictines
at
oxford
and
there
remained
until
the
dissolution
of
the
college
by
henry
when
they
were
dispersed
some
going
into
duke
humphrey
the
university
library
others
to
balliol
college
and
the
remainder
passing
into
the
hands
of
george
owen
who
purchased
the
site
of
the
dissolved
college
clark
puts
the
matter
as
follows
durham
college
maintained
by
the
benedictines
of
durham
was
supplied
with
books
from
the
lists
of
which
have
been
preserved
and
subsequently
a
library
was
built
there
to
contain
the
collection
bequeathed
in
by
richard
de
bury
the
care
of
books
thomas
points
out
that
de
bury
executors
sold
at
least
some
portion
of
his
books
and
moreover
his
biographer
says
nothing
of
a
library
at
oxford
possibly
the
scheme
was
never
carried
out
in
the
british
museum

large
folio
of
the
works
of
john
of
salisbury
which
was
one
of
the
books
bought
back
from
the
bishop
executors
unfortunately
the
special
catalogue
of
his
books
prepared
by
richard
has
not
come
down
to
us
but
from
his
own
book
and
from
the
books
cited
in
the
works
of
his
friends
and
housemates
who
may
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
drawn
largely
from
the
bishop
collection
it
would
be
possible
to
restore
a
hypothetical
but
not
improbable
bibliotheca
ricardi
de
bury
the
difficulty
would
be
with
that
contemporary
literature
which
they
would
think
below
the
dignity
of
quotation
but
which
we
know
the
bishop
collected
early

based
on
the

though
the
french
edition
and
translation
of
prepared
by
cocheris
claimed
to
be
a
critical
version
it
left
the

untouched
and
merely
gave
the
various
readings
of
the
three
paris
manuscripts
at
the
foot
of
the
pages
these
readings
are
moreover
badly
chosen
and
the
faults
of
the
version
are
further
to
be
referred
to
the
use
of
the

appeared
an
anonymous

ideal

had
toiled
at
his
labour

his
work
was
on
all
sides
received
with
the
recognition
due
to
his
monumental
achievement
to
the
great
loss
of
english
learning
he
did
not
long
survive
the
conclusion
of
his
labours
the
very
limited
edition
of
the

was
soon
exhausted
and
it
is
by
the
most
generous
permission
of

thanks
to

also
to

their
kindness
in

attempted
in

brief
preface

notes
to
condense
thomas

in
such
a
way
as
would
have
been
acceptable
to
the
lamented
scholar
and
though
he
has
made
bold
to
explain
some
few
textual
difficulties
and
to
add
some
few
references
he
would
fain
hope
that
these
additions
have
been
made
with
modest
caution

the
reverence
due

asks
the
most
devout
psalmist
an
invincible
king
and

among
the
prophets
in
which
most
grateful
question
he
approves
himself
a
willing
a
multifarious
debtor
and
one
who
wishes
for
a
holier
counsellor
than
himself
agreeing
with
aristotle
the
chief
of
philosophers
who
shows
in
the
and
books
of
his
ethics
that
all
action
depends
upon
counsel
and
indeed
if
so
wonderful
a
prophet
having
a
of
divine
secrets
wished
so
anxiously
to
consider
how
he
might
gratefully
repay
the
blessings
graciously
bestowed
what
can
we
fitly
do
who
are
but
rude
thanksgivers
and
most
greedy
receivers
laden
with
infinite
divine
benefits
assuredly
we
ought
with
anxious
deliberation
and
abundant
consideration
having
first
invoked
the
sevenfold
spirit
that
it
may
burn
in
our
musings
as
an
illuminating
fire
fervently
to
prepare
a
way
without
hinderance
that
the
bestower
of
all
things
may
be
cheerfully
worshipped
in
return
for
the
gifts
that
he
has
bestowed
that
our
neighbour
may
be
relieved
of
his
burden
and
that
the
guilt
contracted
by
sinners
every
day
may
be
redeemed
by
the
atonement
of
almsgiving
forewarned
therefore
through
the
admonition
of
the
psalmist
devotion
by
him
who
alone
prevents
and
perfects
the
goodwill
of
man
without
whom
we
have
no
power
even
so
much
as
to
think
and
whose
gift
we
doubt
not
it
is
if
we
have
done
anything
good
we
have
diligently
inquired
and
considered
in
our
own
heart
as
well
as
with
others
what
among
the
good
offices
of
various
works
of
piety
would
most
please
the
almighty
and
would
be
more
beneficial
to
the
church
militant
and
lo
there
soon
occurred
to
our
contemplation
a
host
of
unhappy
nay
rather
of
elect
scholars
in
whom
god
the
creator
and
nature
his
handmaid
planted
the
roots
of
excellent
morals
and
of
famous
sciences
but
whom
the
poverty
of
their
circumstances
so
oppressed
that
before
the
frown
of
adverse
fortune
the
seeds
of
excellence
so
fruitful
in
the
cultivated
field
of
youth
not
being
watered
by
the
rain
that
they
require
are
forced
to
wither
away
thus
it
happens
that
bright
virtue
lurks
buried
in
obscurity
to
use
the
words
of
boethius
and
burning
lights
are
not
put
under
a
bushel
but
for
want
of
oil
are
utterly
extinguished
thus
the
field
so
full
of
flower
in
spring
has
withered
up
before
harvest
time
thus
wheat
degenerates
to
tares
and
vines
into
the
wild
vines
and
thus
olives
run
into
the
wild
olive
the
tender
stems
rot
away
altogether
and
those
who
might
have
grown
up
into
strong
pillars
of
the
church
being
endowed
with
the
capacity
of
a
subtle
intellect
abandon
the
schools
of
learning
with
poverty
only
as
their
stepmother
they
are
repelled
violently
from
the
nectared
cup
of
philosophy
as
soon
as
they
have
tasted
of
it
and
have
become
more
fiercely
thirsty
by
the
very
taste
though
fit
for
the
liberal
arts
and
disposed
to
study
the
sacred
writings
alone
being
deprived
of
the
aid
of
their
friends
by
a
kind
of
apostasy
they
return
to
the
mechanical
arts
solely
to
gain
a
livelihood
to
the
loss
of
the
church
and
the
degradation
of
the
whole
clergy
thus
mother
church
conceiving
sons
is
compelled
to
miscarry
nay
some
misshapen
monster
is
born
untimely
from
her
womb
and
for
lack
of
that
little
with
which
nature
is
contented
she
loses
excellent
pupils
who
might
afterwards
become
champions
and
athletes
of
the
faith
alas
how
suddenly
the
woof
is
cut
while
the
hand
of
the
weaver
is
beginning
his
work
alas
how
the
sun
is
eclipsed
in
the
brightness
of
the
dawn
and
the
planet
in
its
course
is
hurled
backwards
and
while
it
bears
the
nature
and
likeness
of
a
star
suddenly
drops
and
becomes
a
meteor
what
more
piteous
sight
can
the
pious
man
behold
what
can
more
sharply
stir
the
bowels
of
his
pity
what
can
more
easily
melt
a
heart
hard
as
an
anvil
into
hot
tears
on
the
other
hand
let
us
recall
from
past
experience
how
much
it
has
profited
the
whole
christian
commonwealth
not
indeed
to
enervate
students
with
the
delights
of
a
sardanapalus
or
the
riches
of
a
croesus
but
rather
to
support
them
in
their
poverty
with
the
frugal
means
that
become
the
scholar
how
many
have
we
seen
with
our
eyes
how
many
have
we
read
of
in
books
who
distinguished
by
no
pride
of
birth
and
rejoicing
in
no
rich
inheritance
but
supported
only
by
the
piety
of
the
good
have
made
their
way
to
apostolic
chairs
have
most
worthily
presided
over
faithful
subjects
have
bent
the
necks
of
the
proud
and
lofty
to
the
ecclesiastical
yoke
and
have
extended
further
the
liberties
of
the
church
accordingly
having
taken
a
survey
of
human
necessities
in
every
direction
with
a
view
to
bestow
our
charity
upon
them
our
compassionate
inclinations
have
chosen
to
bear
pious
aid
to
this
calamitous
class
of
men
in
whom
there
is
nevertheless
such
hope
of
advantage
to
the
church
and
to
provide
for
them
not
only
in
respect
of
things
necessary
to
their
support
but
much
more
in
respect
of
the
books
so
useful
to
their
studies
to
this
end
most
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
attention
has
long
been
unweariedly
devoted
this
ecstatic
love
has
carried
us
away
so
powerfully
that
we
have
resigned
all
thoughts
of
other
earthly
things
and
have
given
ourselves
up
to
a
passion
for
acquiring
books
that
our
intent
and
purpose
therefore
may
be
known
to
posterity
as
well
as
to
our
contemporaries
and
that
we
may
for
ever
stop
the
perverse
tongues
of
gossipers
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
we
have
published
a
little
treatise
written
in
the
lightest
style
of
the
moderns
for
it
is
ridiculous
to
find
a
slight
matter
treated
of
in
a
pompous
style
and
this
treatise
divided
into
twenty
chapters
will
clear
the
love
we
have
had
for
books
from
the
charge
of
excess
will
expound
the
purpose
of
our
intense
devotion
and
will
narrate
more
clearly
than
light
all
the
circumstances
of
our
undertaking
and
because
it
principally
treats
of
the
love
of
books
we
have
chosen
after
the
fashion
of
the
ancient
romans
fondly
to
name
it
by
a
greek
word
philobiblon
chapter
i
that
the
treasure
of
wisdom
is
chiefly
contained
in
books
the
desirable
treasure
of
wisdom
and
science
which
all
men
desire
by
an
instinct
of
nature
infinitely
surpasses
all
the
riches
of
the
world
in
respect
of
which
precious
stones
are
worthless
in
comparison
with
which
silver
is
as
clay
and
pure
gold
is
as
a
little
sand
at
whose
splendour
the
sun
and
moon
are
dark
to
look
upon
compared
with
whose
marvellous
sweetness
honey
and
manna
are
bitter
to
the
taste
o
value
of
wisdom
that
fadeth
not
away
with
time
virtue
ever
flourishing
that
cleanseth
its
possessor
from
all
venom

divine

thou

up
by
the

hidden

and
where

thirsting

discover
thee
certes
thou
hast
placed
thy
tabernacle
in

most
high

than
by

the

that

renders

this

in

that
so
long
as
the

remains

declares
in

prologue
to

he
says
who
has
given

to

who
therefore
will
limit
by
anything
of
another
kind
the
price
of
the
infinite
treasure
of
books
from
which
the
scribe
who
is
instructed
bringeth
forth
things
new
and
old
truth
that
triumphs
over
all
things
which
overcomes
the
king
wine
and
women
which
it
is
reckoned
holy
to
honour
before
friendship
which
is
the
way
without
turning
and
the
life
without
end
which
holy
boethius
considers
to
be
threefold
in
thought
speech
and
writing
seems
to
remain
more
usefully
and
to
fructify
to
greater
profit
in
books
for
the
meaning
of
the
voice
perishes
with
the
sound
truth
latent
in
the
mind
is
wisdom
that
is
hid
and
treasure
that
is
not
seen
but
truth
which
shines
forth
in
books
desires
to
manifest
itself
to
every
impressionable
sense
it
commends
itself
to
the
sight
when
it
is
read
to
the
hearing
when
it
is
heard
and
moreover
in
a
manner
to
the
touch
when
it
suffers
itself
to
be
transcribed
bound
corrected
and
preserved
the
undisclosed
truth
of
the
mind
although
it
is
the
possession
of
the
noble
soul
yet
because
it
lacks
a
companion
is
not
certainly
known
to
be
delightful
while
neither
sight
nor
hearing
takes
account
of
it
further
the
truth
of
the
voice
is
patent
only
to
the
ear
and
eludes
the
sight
which
reveals
to
us
more
of
the
qualities
of
things
and
linked
with
the
subtlest
of
motions
begins
and
perishes
as
it
were
in
a
breath
but
the
written
truth
of
books
not
transient
but
permanent
plainly
offers
itself
to
be
observed
and
by
means
of
the
pervious
spherules
of
the
eyes
passing
through
the
vestibule
of
perception
and
the
courts
of
imagination
enters
the
chamber
of
intellect
taking
its
place
in
the
couch
of
memory
where
it
engenders
the
eternal
truth
of
the
mind
finally
we
must
consider
what
pleasantness
of
teaching
there
is
in
books
how
easy
how
secret
how
safely
we
lay
bare
the
poverty
of
human
ignorance
to
books
without
feeling
any
shame
they
are
masters
who
instruct
us
without
rod
or
ferule
without
angry
words
without
clothes
or
money
if
you
come
to
them
they
are
not
asleep
if
you
ask
and
inquire
of
them
they
do
not
withdraw
themselves
they
do
not
chide
if
you
make
mistakes
they
do
not
laugh
at
you
if
you
are
ignorant
o
books
who
alone
are
liberal
and
free
who
give
to
all
who
ask
of
you
and
enfranchise
all
who
serve
you
faithfully
by
how
many

chapter
ii
the
degree
of
affection
that
is
properly
due
to
books
since
the
degree
of
affection
a
thing
deserves
depends
upon
the
degree
of
its
value
and
the
previous
chapter
shows
that
the
value
of
books
is
unspeakable
it
is
quite
clear
to
the
reader
what
is
the
probable
conclusion
from
this
i
say
probable
for
in
moral
science
we
do
not
insist
upon
demonstration
remembering
that
the
educated
man
seeks
such
degree
of
certainty
as
he
perceives
the
will
bear
as
aristotle
testifies
in
the
first
book
of
his
ethics
for
tully
does
not
appeal
to
euclid
nor
does
euclid
rely
upon
tully
this
at
all
events
we
endeavour
to
prove
whether
by
logic
or
rhetoric
that
all
riches
and
all
delights
whatsoever
yield
place
to
books
in
the
spiritual
mind
wherein
the
spirit
which
is
charity
ordereth
charity
now
in
the
first
place
because
wisdom
is
contained
in
books
more
than
all
mortals
understand
and
wisdom
thinks
lightly
of
riches
as
the
foregoing
chapter
declares
furthermore
aristotle
in
his
problems
determines
the
question
why
the
ancients
proposed
prizes
to
the
stronger
in
gymnastic
and
corporeal
contests
but
never
awarded
any
prize
for
wisdom
this
question
he
solves
as
follows
in
gymnastic
exercises
the
prize
is
better
and
more
desirable
than
that
for
which
it
is
bestowed
but
it
is
certain
that
nothing
is
better
than
wisdom
wherefore
no
prize
could
be
assigned
for
wisdom
and
therefore
neither
riches
nor
delights
are
more
excellent
than
wisdom
again
only
the
fool
will
deny
that
friendship
is
to
be
preferred
to
riches
since
the
wisest
of
men
testifies
this
but
the
chief
of
philosophers
honours
truth
before
friendship
and
the
truthful
zorobabel
prefers
it
to
all
things
riches
then
are
less
than
truth
now
truth
is
chiefly
maintained
and
contained
in
holy
books
nay
they
are
written
truth
itself
since
by
books
we
do
not
now
mean
the
materials
of
which
they
are
made
wherefore
riches
are
less
than
books
especially
as
the
most
precious
of
all
riches
are
friends
as
boethius
testifies
in
the
second
book
of
his
consolation
to
whom
the
truth
of
books
according
to
aristotle
is
to
be
preferred
moreover
since
we
know
that
riches
first
and
chiefly
appertain
to
the
support
of
the
body
only
while
the
virtue
of
books
is
the
perfection
of
reason
which
is
properly
speaking
the
happiness
of
man
it
appears
that
books
to
the
man
who
uses
his
reason
are
dearer
than
riches
furthermore
that
by
which
the
faith
is
more
easily
defended
more
widely
spread
more
clearly
preached
ought
to
be
more
desirable
to
the
faithful
but
this
is
the
truth
written
in
books
which
our
saviour
plainly
showed
when
he
was
about
to
contend
stoutly
against
the
tempter
girding
himself
with
the
shield
of
truth
and
indeed
of
written
truth
declaring
it
is
written
of
what
he
was
about
to
utter
with
his
voice
and
again
no
one
doubts
that
happiness
is
to
be
preferred
to
riches
but
happiness
consists
in
the
operation
of
the
noblest
and
diviner
of
the
faculties
that
we
possess
when
the
whole
mind
is
occupied
in
contemplating
the
truth
of
wisdom
which
is
the
most
delectable
of
all
our
virtuous
activities
as
the
prince
of
philosophers
declares
in
the
tenth
book
of
the
ethics
on
which
account
it
is
that
philosophy
is
held
to
have
wondrous
pleasures
in
respect
of
purity
and
solidity
as
he
goes
on
to
say
but
the
contemplation
of
truth
is
never
more
perfect
than
in
books
where
the
act
of
imagination
perpetuated
by
books
does
not
suffer
the
operation
of
the
intellect
upon
the
truths
that
it
has
seen
to
suffer
interruption
wherefore
books
appear
to
be
the
most
immediate
instruments
of
speculative
delight
and
therefore
aristotle
the
sun
of
philosophic
truth
in
considering
the
principles
of
choice
teaches
that
in
itself
to
philosophize
is
more
desirable
than
to
be
rich
although
in
certain
cases
as
where
for
instance
one
is
in
need
of
necessaries
it
may
be
more
desirable
to
be
rich
than
to
philosophize
moreover
since
books
are
the
aptest
teachers
as
the
previous
chapter
assumes
it
is
fitting
to
bestow
on
them
the
honour
and
the
affection
that
we
owe
to
our
teachers
in
fine
since
all
men
naturally
desire
to
know
and
since
by
means
of
books
we
can
attain
the
knowledge
of
the
ancients
which
is
to
be
desired
beyond
all
riches
what
man
living
according
to
nature
would
not
feel
the
desire
of
books
and
although
we
know
that
swine
trample
pearls
under
foot
the
wise
man
will
not
therefore
be
deterred
from
gathering
the
pearls
that
lie
before
him
a
library
of
wisdom
then
is
more
precious
than
all
wealth
and
all
things
that
are
desirable
can
not
be
compared
to
it
whoever
therefore
claims
to
be
zealous
of
truth
of
happiness
of
wisdom
or
knowledge
aye
even
of
the
faith
must
needs
become
a
lover
of
books
chapter
iii
what
we
are
to
think
of
the
price
in
the
buying
of
books
from
what
has
been
said
we
draw
this
corollary
welcome
to
us
but
as
we
believe
acceptable
to
few
namely
that
no
dearness
of
price
ought
to
hinder
a
man
from
the
buying
of
books
if
he
has
the
money
that
is
demanded
for
them
unless
it
be
to
withstand
the
malice
of
the
seller
or
to
await
a
more
favourable
opportunity
of
buying
for
if
it
is
wisdom
only
that
makes
the
price
of
books
which
is
an
infinite
treasure
to
mankind
and
if
the
value
of
books
is
unspeakable
as
the
premises
show
how
shall
the
bargain
be
shown
to
be
dear
where
an
infinite
good
is
being
bought
wherefore
that
books
are
to
be
gladly
bought
and
unwillingly
sold
solomon
the
sun
of
men
exhorts
us
in
the
proverbs
buy
the
truth
he
says
and
sell
not
wisdom
but
what
we
are
trying
to
show
by
rhetoric
or
logic
let
us
prove
by
examples
from
history
the
aristotle
whom
averroes
regards
as
the
law
of
nature
bought
a
few
books
of
speusippus
straightway
after
his
death
for
sesterces
plato
before
him
in
time
but
after
him
in
learning
bought
the
book
of
philolaus
the
pythagorean
from
which
he
is
said
to
have
taken
the
timaeus
for
denaries
as
aulus
gellius
relates
in
the
noctes
atticae
now
aulus
gellius
relates
this
that
the
foolish
may
consider
how
wise
men
despise
money
in
comparison
with
books
and
on
the
other
hand
that
we
may
know
that
folly
and
pride
go
together
let
us
here
relate
the
folly
of
tarquin
the
proud
in
despising
books
as
also
related
by
aulus
gellius
an
old
woman
utterly
unknown
is
said
to
have
come
to
tarquin
the
proud
the
seventh
king
of
rome
offering
to
sell
nine
books
in
which
as
she
declared
sacred
oracles
were
contained
but
she
asked
an
immense
sum
for
them
insomuch
that
the
king
said
she
was
mad
in
anger
she
flung
three
books
into
the
fire
and
still
asked
the
same
sum
for
the
rest
when
the
king
refused
it
again
she
flung
three
others
into
the
fire
and
still
asked
the
same
price
for
the
three
that
were
left
at
last
astonished
beyond
measure
tarquin
was
glad
to
pay
for
three
books
the
same
price
for
which
he
might
have
bought
nine
the
old
woman
straightway
disappeared
and
was
never
seen
before
or
after
these
were
the
sibylline
books
which
the
romans
consulted
as
a
divine
oracle
by
some
one
of
the
quindecemvirs
and
this
is
believed
to
have
been
the
origin
of
the
quindecemvirate
what
did
this
sibyl
teach
the
proud
king
by
this
bold
deed
except
that
the
vessels
of
wisdom
holy
books
exceed
all
human
estimation
and
as
gregory
says
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
they
are
worth
all
that
thou
hast
chapter
iv
the
complaint
of
books
against
the
clergy
already
promoted
a
generation
of
vipers
destroying
their
own
parent
and
base
offspring
of
the
ungrateful
cuckoo
who
when
he
has
grown
strong
slays
his
nurse
the
giver
of
his
strength
are
degenerate
clerks
with
regard
to
books
bring
it
again
to
mind
and
consider
faithfully
what
ye
receive
through
books
and
ye
will
find
that
books
are
as
it
were
the
creators
of
your
distinction
without
which
other
favourers
would
have
been
wanting
in
sooth
while
still
untrained
and
helpless
ye
crept
up
to
us
ye
spake
as
children
ye
thought
as
children
ye
cried
as
children
and
begged
to
be
made
partakers
of
our
milk
but
we
being
straightway
moved
by
your
tears
gave
you
the
breast
of
grammar
to
suck
which
ye
plied
continually
with
teeth
and
tongue
until
ye
lost
your
native
barbarousness
and
learned
to
speak
with
our
tongues
the
mighty
things
of
god
and
next
we
clad
you
with
the
goodly
garments
of
philosophy
rhetoric
and
dialectic
of
which
we
had
and
have
a
store
while
ye
were
naked
as
a
tablet
to
be
painted
on
for
all
the
household
of
philosophy
are
clothed
with
garments
that
the
nakedness
and
rawness
of
the
intellect
may
be
covered
after
this
providing
you
with
the
fourfold
wings
of
the
quadrivials
that
ye
might
be
winged
like
the
seraphs
and
so
mount
above
the
cherubim
we
sent
you
to
a
friend
at
whose
door
if
only
ye
importunately
knocked
ye
might
borrow
the
three
loaves
of
the
knowledge
of
the
trinity
in
which
consists
the
final
felicity
of
every
sojourner
below
nay
if
ye
deny
that
ye
had
these
privileges
we
boldly
declare
that
ye
either
lost
them
by
your
carelessness
or
that
through
your
sloth
ye
spurned
them
when
offered
to
you
if
these
things
seem
but
a
light
matter
to
you
we
will
add
yet
greater
things
ye
are
a
chosen
people
a
royal
priesthood
a
holy
race
ye
are
a
peculiar
people
chosen
into
the
lot
of
god
ye
are
priests
and
ministers
of
god
nay
ye
are
called
the
very
church
of
god
as
though
the
laity
were
not
to
be
called
churchmen
ye
being
preferred
to
the
laity
sing
psalms
and
hymns
in
the
chancel
and
serving
the
altar
and
living
by
the
altar
make
the
true
body
of
christ
wherein
god
himself
has
honoured
you
not
only
above
the
laity
but
even
a
little
higher
than
the
angels
for
to
whom
of
his
angels
has
he
said
at
any
time
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
after
the
order
of
melchisedech
ye
dispense
the
patrimony
of
the
crucified
one
to
the
poor
wherein
it
is
required
of
stewards
that
a
man
be
found
faithful
ye
are
shepherds
of
the
lord
flock
as
well
in
example
of
life
as
in
the
word
of
doctrine
which
is
bound
to
repay
you
with
milk
and
wool
who
are
the
givers
of
all
these
things
o
clerks
is
it
not
books
do
ye
remember
therefore
we
pray
how
many
and
how
great
liberties
and
privileges
are
bestowed
upon
the
clergy
through
us
in
truth
taught
by
us
who
are
the
vessels
of
wisdom
and
intellect
ye
ascend
the
teacher
chair
and
are
called
of
men
rabbi
by
us
ye
become
marvellous
in
the
eyes
of
the
laity
like
great
lights
in
the
world
and
possess
the
dignities
of
the
church
according
to
your
various
stations
by
us
while
ye
still
lack
the
first
down
upon
your
cheeks
ye
are
established
in
your
early
years
and
bear
the
tonsure
on
your
heads
while
the
dread
sentence
of
the
church
is
heard
touch
not
mine
anointed
and
do
my
prophets
no
harm
and
he
who
has
rashly
touched
them
let
him
forthwith
by
his
own
blow
be
smitten
violently
with
the
wound
of
an
anathema
at
length
yielding
your
lives
to
wickedness
reaching
the
two
paths
of
pythagoras
ye
choose
the
left
branch
and
going
backward
ye
let
go
the
lot
of
god
which
ye
had
first
assumed
becoming
companions
of
thieves
and
thus
ever
going
from
bad
to
worse
dyed
with
theft
and
murder
and
manifold
impurities
your
fame
and
conscience
stained
by
sins
at
the
bidding
of
justice
ye
are
confined
in
manacles
and
fetters
and
are
kept
to
be
punished
by
a
most
shameful
death
then
your
friend
is
put
far
away
nor
is
there
any
to
mourn
your
lot
peter
swears
that
he
knows
not
the
man
the
people
cry
to
the
judge
crucify
crucify
him
if
thou
let
this
man
go
thou
act
not
friend
now
all
refuge
has
perished
for
ye
must
stand
before
the
and
there
is
no
appeal
but
only
hanging
is
in
store
for
you
while
the
wretched
man
heart
is
thus
filled
with
woe
and
only
the
sorrowing
muses
bedew
their
cheeks
with
tears
in
his
strait
is
heard
on
every
side
the
wailing
appeal
to
us
and
to
avoid
the
danger
of
impending
death
he
shows
the
slight
sign
of
the
ancient
tonsure
which
we
bestowed
upon
him
begging
that
we
may
be
called
to
his
aid
and
bear
witness
to
the
privilege
bestowed
upon
him
then
straightway
touched
with
pity
we
run
to
meet
the
prodigal
son
and
snatch
the
fugitive
slave
from
the
gates
of
death
the
book
he
has
not
forgotten
is
handed
to
him
to
be
read
and
while
with
lips
stammering
with
fear
he
reads
a
few
words
the
power
of
the
judge
is
loosed
the
accuser
is
withdrawn
and
death
is
put
to
flight
o
marvellous
virtue
of
an
empiric
verse
o
saving
antidote
of
dreadful
ruin
o
precious
reading
of
the
psalter
which
for
this
alone
deserves
to
be
called
the
book
of
life
let
the
laity
undergo
the
judgment
of
the
secular
arm
that
either
sewn
up
in
sacks
they
may
be
carried
out
to
neptune
or
planted
in
the
earth
may
fructify
for
pluto
or
may
be
offered
amid
the
flames
as
a
fattened
holocaust
to
vulcan
or
at
least
may
be
hung
up
as
a
victim
to
juno
while
our
nursling
at
a
single
reading
of
the
book
of
life
is
handed
over
to
the
custody
of
the
bishop
and
rigour
is
changed
to
favour
and
the
forum
being
transferred
from
the
laity
death
is
routed
by
the
clerk
who
is
the
nursling
of
books
but
now
let
us
speak
of
the
clerks
who
are
vessels
of
virtue
which
of
you
about
to
preach
ascends
the
pulpit
or
the
rostrum
without
in
some
way
consulting
us
which
of
you
enters
the
schools
to
teach
or
to
dispute
without
relying
upon
our
support
first
of
all
it
behoves
you
to
eat
the
book
with
ezechiel
that
the
belly
of
your
memory
may
be
sweetened
within
and
thus
as
with
the
panther
refreshed
to
whose
breath
all
beasts
and
cattle
long
to
approach
the
sweet
savour
of
the
spices
it
has
eaten
may
shed
a
perfume
without
thus
our
nature
secretly
working
in
our
own
listeners
hasten
up
gladly
as
the
draws
the
iron
nothing
loth
what
an
infinite
host
of
books
lie
at
paris
or
athens
and
at
the
same
time
resound
in
britain
and
in
rome
in
truth
while
resting
they
yet
move
and
while
retaining
their
own
places
they
are
carried
about
every
way
to
the
minds
of
listeners
finally
by
the
knowledge
of
literature
we
establish
priests
bishops
cardinals
and
the
pope
that
all
things
in
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
may
be
fitly
disposed
for
it
is
from
books
that
everything
of
good
that
befalls
the
clerical
condition
takes
its
origin
but
let
this
suffice
for
it
pains
us
to
recall
what
we
have
bestowed
upon
the
degenerate
clergy
because
whatever
gifts
are
distributed
to
the
ungrateful
seem
to
be
lost
rather
than
bestowed
let
us
next
dwell
a
little
on
the
recital
of
the
wrongs
with
which
they
requite
us
the
contempts
and
cruelties
of
which
we
can
not
recite
an
example
in
each
kind
nay
scarcely
the
main
classes
of
the
several
wrongs
in
the
first
place
we
are
expelled
by
force
and
arms
from
the
homes
of
the
clergy
which
are
ours
by
hereditary
right
who
were
used
to
have
cells
of
quietness
in
the
inner
chamber
but
alas
in
these
unhappy
times
we
are
altogether
exiled
suffering
poverty
without
the
gates
for
our
places
are
seized
now
by
dogs
now
by
hawks
now
by
that
biped
beast
whose
cohabitation
with
the
clergy
was
forbidden
of
old
from
which
we
have
always
taught
our
nurslings
to
flee
more
than
from
the
asp
and
the
cockatrice
wherefore
she
always
jealous
of
the
love
of
us
and
never
to
be
appeased
at
length
seeing
us
in
some
corner
protected
only
by
the
web
of
some
dead
spider
with
a
frown
abuses
and
reviles
us
with
bitter
words
declaring
us
alone
of
all
the
furniture
in
the
house
to
be
unnecessary
and
complaining
that
we
are
useless
for
any
household
purpose
and
advises
that
we
should
speedily
be
converted
into
rich
caps
sendal
and
silk
and
purple
robes
and
furs
wool
and
linen
and
indeed
not
without
reason
if
she
could
see
our
inmost
hearts
if
she
had
listened
to
our
secret
counsels
if
she
had
read
the
book
of
theophrastus
or
valerius
or
only
heard
the
chapter
of
ecclesiasticus
with
understanding
ears
and
hence
it
is
that
we
have
to
mourn
for
the
homes
of
which
we
have
been
unjustly
robbed
and
as
to
our
coverings
not
that
they
have
not
been
given
to
us
but
that
the
coverings
anciently
given
to
us
have
been
torn
by
violent
hands
insomuch
that
our
soul
is
bowed
down
to
the
dust
our
belly
cleaveth
unto
the
earth
we
suffer
from
various
diseases
enduring
pains
in
our
backs
and
sides
we
lie
with
our
limbs
unstrung
by
palsy
and
there
is
no
man
who
layeth
it
to
heart
and
no
man
who
provides
a
mollifying
plaster
our
native
whiteness
that
was
clear
with
light
has
turned
to
dun
and
yellow
so
that
no
leech
who
should
see
us
would
doubt
that
we
are
diseased
with
jaundice
some
of
us
are
suffering
from
gout
as
our
twisted
extremities
plainly
show
the
smoke
and
dust
by
which
we
are
continuously
plagued
have
dulled
the
keenness
of
our
visual
rays
and
are
now
infecting
our
bleared
eyes
with
ophthalmia
within
we
are
devoured
by
the
fierce
gripings
of
our
entrails
which
hungry
worms
cease
not
to
gnaw
and
we
undergo
the
corruption
of
the
two
lazaruses
nor
is
there
anyone
to
anoint
us
with
balm
of
cedar
nor
to
cry
to
us
who
have
been
four
days
dead
and
already
stink
lazarus
come
forth
no
healing
drug
is
bound
around
our
cruel
wounds
which
are
so
atrociously
inflicted
upon
the
innocent
and
there
is
none
to
put
a
plaster
upon
our
ulcers
but
ragged
and
shivering
we
are
flung
away
into
dark
corners
or
in
tears
take
our
place
with
holy
job
upon
his
dunghill
or
too
horrible
to
relate
are
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
common
sewers
the
cushion
is
withdrawn
that
should
support
our
evangelical
sides
which
ought
to
have
the
first
claim
upon
the
incomes
of
the
clergy
and
the
common
necessaries
of
life
thus
be
for
ever
provided
for
us
who
are
entrusted
to
their
charge
again
we
complain
of
another
sort
of
injury
which
is
too
often
unjustly
inflicted
upon
our
persons
we
are
sold
for
bondmen
and
bondwomen
and
lie
as
hostages
in
taverns
with
no
one
to
redeem
us
we
fall
a
prey
to
the
cruel
shambles
where
we
see
sheep
and
cattle
slaughtered
not
without
pious
tears
and
where
we
die
a
thousand
times
from
such
terrors
as
might
frighten
even
the
brave
we
are
handed
over
to
jews
saracens
heretics
and
infidels
whose
poison
we
always
dread
above
everything
and
by
whom
it
is
well
known
that
some
of
our
parents
have
been
infected
with
pestiferous
venom
in
sooth
we
who
should
be
treated
as
masters
in
the
sciences
and
bear
rule
over
the
mechanics
who
should
be
subject
to
us
are
instead
handed
over
to
the
government
of
subordinates
as
though
some
supremely
noble
monarch
should
be
trodden
under
foot
by
rustic
heels
any
seamster
or
cobbler
or
tailor
or
artificer
of
any
trade
keeps
us
shut
up
in
prison
for
the
luxurious
and
wanton
pleasures
of
the
clergy
now
we
would
pursue
a
new
kind
of
injury
by
which
we
suffer
alike
in
person
and
in
fame
the
dearest
thing
we
have
our
purity
of
race
is
diminished
every
day
while
new
authors
names
are
imposed
upon
us
by
worthless
compilers
translators
and
transformers
and
losing
our
ancient
nobility
while
we
are
reborn
in
successive
generations
we
become
wholly
degenerate
and
thus
against
our
will
the
name
of
some
wretched
stepfather
is
affixed
to
us
and
the
sons
are
robbed
of
the
names
of
their
true
fathers
the
verses
of
virgil
while
he
was
yet
living
were
claimed
by
an
impostor
and
a
certain
fidentinus
mendaciously
usurped
the
works
of
martial
whom
martial
thus
deservedly
rebuked
the
book
you
read
is
fidentinus
mine
though
read
so
badly
well
may
pass
for
thine
what
marvel
then
if
when
our
authors
are
dead
clerical
apes
use
us
to
make
broad
their
phylacteries
since
even
while
they
are
alive
they
try
to
seize
us
as
soon
as
we
are
published
ah
how
often
ye
pretend
that
we
who
are
ancient
are
but
lately
born
and
try
to
pass
us
off
as
sons
who
are
really
fathers
calling
us
who
have
made
you
clerks
the
production
of
your
studies
indeed
we
derived
our
origin
from
athens
though
we
are
now
supposed
to
be
from
rome
for
carmentis
was
always
the
pilferer
of
cadmus
and
we
who
were
but
lately
born
in
england
will
be
born
again
in
paris
and
thence
being
carried
to
bologna
will
obtain
an
italian
origin
based
upon
no
affinity
of
blood
alas
how
ye
commit
us
to
treacherous
copyists
to
be
written
how
corruptly
ye
read
us
and
kill
us
by
medication
while
ye
supposed
ye
were
correcting
us
with
pious
zeal
oftentimes
we
have
to
endure
barbarous
interpreters
and
those
who
are
ignorant
of
foreign
idioms
presume
to
translate
us
from
one
language
into
another
and
thus
all
propriety
of
speech
is
lost
and
our
sense
is
shamefully
mutilated
contrary
to
the
meaning
of
the
author
truly
noble
would
have
been
the
condition
of
books
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
presumption
of
the
tower
of
babel
if
but
one
kind
of
speech
had
been
transmitted
by
the
whole
human
race
we
will
add
the
last
clause
of
our
long
lament
though
far
too
short
for
the
materials
that
we
have
for
in
us
the
natural
use
is
changed
to
that
which
is
against
nature
while
we
who
are
the
light
of

be
asked
for

at
a

hour
he
who
asks
for

after
the
hour
is
not

receive
them
scarcely
anyone
observes
this
devout
rule
of
study
after
saying
the
prayers
of
the
church
but
to
care
for
the
things
of
this
world
and
to
look
at
the
plough
that
has
been
left
is
reckoned
the
highest
wisdom
they
take
up

embrace

devote

to

and
not
to

and
of
all
such
things
as
we
are
wont
to
forbid

to

secular

so
that
we
need
not
marvel
if
they
disdain
to
look
upon
us
whom
they
see
so
much
opposed
to
their
mode

come
then
reverend
fathers
deign
to
recall
your

and
devote
yourselves
more
faithfully
to
the
study
of
holy

without
which
all

will
stagger
without
which
the
virtue
of
devotion
will
dry
up
like

afford
no

the
complaint
of

against
the
mendicants
poor
in
spirit
but
most
rich
in
faith
of
the
world
and
salt
of
the
earth
despisers
of
the
world
and

of
men
how
happy
are
ye
if
suffering
penury
for
christ
ye
know
how
to
possess
your
souls
in
patience
for
it
is
not
want
the
avenger
of
iniquity
nor
the
adverse
fortune
of
your
parents
nor
violent
necessity
that
has
thus
oppressed
you
with
beggary
but
a
devout
will
and
election
by
which
ye
have
chosen
that
life
as
the
best
which
god
almighty
made
man
as
well
by
word
as
by
example
declared
to
be
the
best
in
truth
ye
are
the
latest
offspring
of
the
church
of
late
divinely
substituted
for
the
fathers
and
the
prophets
that
your
sound
may
go
forth
into
all
the
earth
and
that
instructed
by
our
healthful
doctrines
ye
may
preach
before
all
kings
and
nations
the
invincible
faith
of
christ
moreover
that
the
faith
of
the
fathers
is
chiefly
enshrined
in
books
the
second
chapter
has
sufficiently
shown
from
which
it
is
clearer
than
light
that
ye
ought
to
be
zealous
lovers
of
books
above
all
other
christians
ye
are
commanded
to
sow
upon
all
waters
because
the
most
high
is
no
respecter
of
persons
nor
does
the
most
holy
desire
the
death
of
sinners
who
offered
himself
to
die
for
them
but
desires
to
heal
the
contrite
in
heart
to
raise
the
fallen
and
to
correct
the
perverse
in
the
spirit
of
lenity
for
which
most
salutary
purpose
our
kindly
mother
church
has
planted
you
freely
and
having
planted
has
watered
you
with
favours
and
having
watered
you
has
established
you
with
privileges
that
ye
may
be
with
pastors
and
curates
in
procuring
the
salvation
of
faithful
souls
wherefore
that
the
order
of
preachers
was
principally
instituted
for
the
study
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
salvation
of
their
neighbours
is
declared
by
their
constitutions
so
that
not
only
from
the
rule
of
bishop
augustine
which
directs
books
to
be
asked
for
every
day
but
as
soon
as
they
have
read
the
prologue
of
the
said
constitutions
they
may
know
from
the
very
title
of
the
same
that
they
are
pledged
to
the
love
of
books
but
alas
a
threefold
care
of
superfluities
of
the
stomach
of
dress
and
of
houses
has
seduced
these
men
and
others
following
their
example
from
the
paternal
care
of
books
and
from
their
study
for
forgetting
the
providence
of
the
saviour
who
is
declared
by
the
psalmist
to
think
upon
the
poor
and
needy
they
are
occupied
with
the
wants
of
the
perishing
body
that
their
feasts
may
be
splendid
and
their
garments
luxurious
against
the
rule
and
the
fabrics
of
their
buildings
like
the
battlements
of
castles
carried
to
a
height
incompatible
with
poverty
because
of
these
three
things
we
books
who
have
ever
procured
their
advancement
and
have
granted
them
to
sit
among
the
powerful
and
noble
are
put
far
from
their
heart
affection
and
are
reckoned
as
superfluities
except
that
they
rely
upon
some
treatises
of
small
value
from
which
they
derive
strange
heresies
and
apocryphal
imbecilities
not
for
the
refreshment
of
souls
but
rather
for
tickling
the
ears
of
the
listeners
the
holy
scripture
is
not
expounded
but
is
neglected
and
treated
as
though
it
were
commonplace
and
known
to
all
though
very
few
have
touched
its
hem
and
though
its
depth
is
such
as
holy
augustine
declares
that
it
can
not
be
understood
by
the
human
intellect
however
long
it
may
toil
with
the
utmost
intensity
of
study
from
this
he
who
devotes
himself
to
it
assiduously
if
only
he
will
vouchsafe
to
open
the
door
who
has
established
the
spirit
of
piety
may
unfold
a
thousand
lessons
of
moral
teaching
which
will
flourish
with
the
freshest
novelty
and
will
cherish
the
intelligence
of
the
listeners
with
the
most
delightful
savours
wherefore
the
first
professors
of
evangelical
poverty
after
some
slight
homage
paid
to
secular
science
collecting
all
their
force
of
intellect
devoted
themselves
to
labours
upon
the
sacred
scripture
meditating
day
and
night
on
the
law
of
the
lord
and
whatever
they
could
steal
from
their
famishing
belly
or
intercept
from
their
body
they
thought
it
the
highest
gain
to
spend
in
buying
or
correcting
books
whose
worldly
contemporaries
observing
their
devotion
and
study
bestowed
upon
them
for
the
edification
of
the
whole
church
the
books
which
they
had
collected
at
great
expense
in
the
various
parts
of
the
world
in
truth
in
these
days
as
ye
are
engaged
with
all
diligence
in
pursuit
of
gain
it
may
be
reasonably
believed
if
we
speak
according
to
human
notions
that
god
thinks
less
upon
those
whom
he
perceives
to
distrust
his
promises
putting
their
hope
in
human
providence
not
considering
the
raven
nor
the
lilies
whom
the
most
high
feeds
and
arrays
ye
do
not
think
upon
daniel
and
the
bearer
of
the
mess
of
boiled
pottage
nor
recollect
elijah
who
was
delivered
from
hunger
once
in
the
desert
by
angels
again
in
the
torrent
by
ravens
and
again
in
sarepta
by
the
widow
through
the
divine
bounty
which
gives
to
all
flesh
their
meat
in
due
season
ye
descend
as
we
fear
by
a
wretched
anticlimax
distrust
of
the
divine
goodness
producing
reliance
upon
your
own
prudence
and
reliance
upon
your
own
prudence
begetting
anxiety
about
worldly
things
and
excessive
anxiety
about
worldly
things
taking
away
the
love
as
well
as
the
study
of
books
and
thus
poverty
in
these
days
is
abused
to
the
injury
of
the
word
of
god
which
ye
have
chosen
only
for
profit
sake
with
summer
fruit
as
the
people
gossip
ye
attract
boys
to
religion
whom
when
they
have
taken
the
vows
ye
do
not
instruct
by
fear
and
force
as
their
age
requires
but
allow
them
to
devote
themselves
to
begging
expeditions
and
suffer
them
to
spend
the
time
in
which
they
might
be
learning
in
procuring
the
favour
of
friends
to
the
annoyance
of
their
parents
the
danger
of
the
boys
and
the
detriment
of
the
order
and
thus
no
doubt
it
happens
that
those
who
were
not
compelled
to
learn
as
unwilling
boys
when
they
grow
up
presume
to
teach
though
utterly
unworthy
and
unlearned
and
a
small
error
in
the
beginning
becomes
a
very
great
one
in
the
end
for
there
grows
up
among
your
promiscuous
flock
of
laity
a
pestilent
multitude
of
creatures
who
nevertheless
the
more
shamelessly
force
themselves
into
the
office
of
preaching
the
less
they
understand
what
they
are
saying
to
the
contempt
of
the
divine
word
and
the
injury
of
souls
in
truth
against
the
law
ye
plough
with
an
ox
and
an
ass
together
in
committing
the
cultivation
of
the
lord
field
to
learned
and
unlearned
side
by
side
it
is
written
the
oxen
were
ploughing
and
the
asses
feeding
beside
them
since
it
is
the
duty
of
the
discreet
to
preach
but
of
the
simple
to
feed
themselves
in
silence
by
the
hearing
of
sacred
eloquence
how
many
stones
ye
fling
upon
the
heap
of
mercury
nowadays
how
many
marriages
ye
procure
for
the
eunuchs
of
wisdom
how
many
blind
watchmen
ye
bid
go
round
about
the
walls
of
the
church
o
idle
fishermen
using
only
the
nets
of
others
which
when
torn
it
is
all
ye
can
do
to
clumsily
repair
but
can
net
no
new
ones
of
your
own
ye
enter
on
the
labours
of

ye
repeat
the
lessons
of

ye

with
theatric
effort
the
superficially
repeated
wisdom
of

as
the
silly
parrot
imitates
the
words
that

has
heard
so
such

are
mere
reciters
of

authors
of
nothing

across
and

check
of

they

of
the
master
of
the
world
enchained
by
wicked
hands
and
borne
in
shameful
irons
on
the
shoulders
of
gladiators
from
his
sacred
home
there
you
may
see
him
who
was
worthy
to
be
lawgiver
to
the
lawgiver
of
the
world
and
to
hold
empire
over
its
emperor
made
the
slave
of
vile
buffoons
by
the
most
unrighteous
laws
of
war
o
most
wicked
power
of
darkness
which
does
not
fear
to
undo
the
approved
divinity
of
plato
who
alone
was
worthy
to
submit
to
the
view
of
the
creator
before
he
assuaged
the
strife
of
warring
chaos
and
before
form
had
put
on
its
garb
of
matter
the
ideal
types
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
archetypal
universe
to
its
author
so
that
the
world
of
sense
might
be
modelled
after
the
supernal
pattern
o
tearful
sight
where
the
moral
socrates
whose
acts
were
virtue
and
whose
discourse
was
science
who
deduced
political
justice
from
the
principles
of
nature
is
seen
enslaved
to
some
rascal
robber
we
bemoan
pythagoras
the
parent
of
harmony
as
brutally
scourged
by
the
harrying
furies
of
war
he
utters
not
a
song
but
the
wailings
of
a
dove
we
mourn
too
for
zeno
who
lest
he
should
betray
his
secret
bit
off
his
tongue
and
fearlessly
spat
it
out
at
the
tyrant
and
now
alas
is
brayed
and
crushed
to
death
in
a
mortar
by
diomedon
in
sooth
we
can
not
mourn
with
the
grief
that
they
deserve
all
the
various
books
that
have
perished
by
the
fate
of
war
in
various
parts
of
the
world
yet
we
must
tearfully
recount
the
dreadful
ruin
which
was
caused
in
egypt
by
the
auxiliaries
in
the
alexandrian
war
when
seven
hundred
thousand
volumes
were
consumed
by
fire
these
volumes
had
been
collected
by
the
royal
ptolemies
through
long
periods
of
time
as
aulus
gellius
relates
what
an
atlantean
progeny
must
be
supposed
to
have
then
perished
including
the
motions
of
the
spheres
all
the
conjunctions
of
the
planets
the
nature
of
the
galaxy
and
the
prognostic
generations
of
comets
and
all
that
exists
in
the
heavens
or
in
the
ether
who
would
not
shudder
at
such
a
hapless
holocaust
where
ink
is
offered
up
instead
of
blood
where
the
glowing
ashes
of
crackling
parchment
were
encarnadined
with
blood
where
the
devouring
flames
consumed
so
many
thousands
of
innocents
in
whose
mouth
was
no
guile
where
the
unsparing
fire
turned
into
stinking
ashes
so
many
shrines
of
eternal
truth
a
lesser
crime
than
this
is
the
sacrifice
of
jephthah
or
agamemnon
where
a
pious
daughter
is
slain
by
a
sword
how
many
labours
of
the
famous
hercules
shall
we
suppose
then
perished
who
because
of
his
knowledge
of
astronomy
is
said
to
have
sustained
the
heaven
on
his
unyielding
neck
when
hercules
was
now
for
the
second
time
cast
into
the
flames
the
secrets
of
the
heavens
which
jonithus
learnt
not
from
man
or
through
man
but
received
by
divine
inspiration
what
his
brother
zoroaster
the
servant
of
unclean
spirits
taught
the
bactrians
what
holy
enoch
the
prefect
of
paradise
prophesied
before
he
was
taken
from
the
world
and
finally
what
the
first
adam
taught
his
children
of
the
things
to
come
which
he
had
seen
when
caught
up
in
an
ecstasy
in
the
book
of
eternity
are
believed
to
have
perished
in
those
horrid
flames
the
religion
of
the
egyptians
which
the
book
of
the
perfect
word
so
commends
the
excellent
polity
of
the
older
athens
which
preceded
by
nine
thousand
years
the
athens
of
greece
the
charms
of
the
chaldaeans
the

of

the

apollo

the

of
palamedes
and
infinite
other
secrets
of
science
are
believed
to
have
perished
at
the
time
of
this
conflagration
nay
aristotle
would
not
have
missed
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
if
only
baleful
conflicts
had
spared
the
books
of
the
ancients
who
knew
all
the
methods
of
nature
he
would
not
have
left
the
problem
of
the
eternity
of
the
world
an
open
question
nor
as
is
credibly
conceived
would
he
have
had
any
doubts
of
the
plurality
of
human
intellects
and
of
their
eternity
if
the
perfect
sciences
of
the
ancients
had
not
been
exposed
to
the
calamities
of
hateful
wars
for
by
wars
we
are
scattered
into
foreign
lands
are
mutilated
wounded
and
shamefully
disfigured
are
buried
under
the
earth
and
overwhelmed
in
the
sea
are
devoured
by
the
flames
and
destroyed
by
every
kind
of
death
how
much
of
our
blood
was
shed
by
warlike
scipio
when
he
was
eagerly
compassing
the
overthrow
of
carthage
the
opponent
and
rival
of
the
roman
empire
how
many
thousands
of
thousands
of
us
did
the
ten
years
war
of
troy
dismiss
from
the
light
of
day
how
many
were
driven
by
anthony
after
the
murder
of
tully
to
seek
hiding
places
in
foreign
provinces
how
many
of
us
were
scattered
by
theodoric
while
boethius
was
in
exile
into
the
different
quarters
of
the
world
like
sheep
whose
shepherd
has
been
struck
down
how
many
when
seneca
fell
a
victim
to
the
cruelty
of
nero
and
willing
yet
unwilling
passed
the
gates
of
death
took
leave
of
him
and
retired
in
tears
not
even
knowing
in
what
quarter
to
seek
for
shelter
happy
was
that
translation
of
books
which
xerxes
is
said
to
have
made
to
persia
from
athens
and
which
seleucus
brought
back
again
from
persia
to
athens
o
glad
and
joyful
return
o
wondrous
joy
which
you
might
then
see
in
athens
when
the
mother
went
in
triumph
to
meet
her
progeny
and
again
showed
the
chambers
in
which
they
had
been
nursed
to
her
now
aging
children
their
old
homes
were
restored
to
their
former
inmates
and
forthwith
boards
of
cedar
with
shelves
and
beams
of
gopher
wood
are
most
skilfully
planed
inscriptions
of
gold
and
ivory
are
designed
for
the
several
compartments
to
which
the
volumes
themselves
are
reverently
brought
and
pleasantly
arranged
so
that
no
one
hinders
the
entrance
of
another
or
injures
its
brother
by
excessive
crowding
but
in
truth
infinite
are
the
losses
which
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
race
of
books
by
wars
and
tumults
and
as
it
is
by
no
means
possible
to
enumerate
and
survey
infinity
we
will
here
finally
set
up
the
gades
of
our
complaint
and
turn
again
to
the
prayers
with
which
we
began
humbly
imploring
that
the
ruler
of
olympus
and
the
most
high
governor
of
all
the
world
will
establish
peace
and
dispel
wars
and
make
our
days
tranquil
under
his
protection
chapter
viii
of
the
numerous
opportunities
we
have
had
of
collecting
a
store
of
books
since
to
everything
there
is
a
season
and
an
opportunity
as
the
wise
ecclesiastes
witnesseth
let
us
now
proceed
to
relate
the
manifold
opportunities
through
which
we
have
been
assisted
by
the
divine
goodness
in
the
acquisition
of
books
although
from
our
youth
upwards
we
had
always
delighted
in
holding
social
commune
with
learned
men
and
lovers
of
books
yet
when
we
prospered
in
the
world
and
made
acquaintance
with
the
king
majesty
and
were
received
into
his
household
we
obtained
ampler
facilities
for
visiting
everywhere
as
we
would
and
of
hunting
as
it
were
certain
most
choice
preserves
libraries
private
as
well
as
public
and
of
the
regular
as
well
as
of
the
secular
clergy
and
indeed
while
we
filled
various
offices
to
the
victorious
prince
and
splendidly
triumphant
king
of
england
edward
the
third
from
the
conquest
whose
reign
may
the
almighty
long
and
peacefully
continue
first
those
about
his
court
but
then
those
concerning
the
public
affairs
of
his
kingdom
namely
the
offices
of
chancellor
and
treasurer
there
was
afforded
to
us
in
consideration
of
the
royal
favour
easy
access
for
the
purpose
of
freely
searching
the
retreats
of
books
in
fact
the
fame
of
our
love
of
them
had
been
soon
winged
abroad
everywhere
and
we
were
reported
to
burn
with
such
desire
for
books
and
especially
old
ones
that
it
was
more
easy
for
any
man
to
gain
our
favour
by
means
of
books
than
of
money
wherefore
since
supported
by
the
goodness
of
the
aforesaid
prince
of
worthy
memory
we
were
able
to
requite
a
man
well
or
ill
to
benefit
or
injure
mightily
great
as
well
as
small
there
flowed
in
instead
of
presents
and
guerdons
and
instead
of
gifts
and
jewels
soiled
tracts
and
battered
codices
gladsome
alike
to
our
eye
and
heart
then
the
aumbries
of
the
most
famous
monasteries
were
thrown
open
cases
were
unlocked
and
caskets
were
undone
and
volumes
that
had
slumbered
through
long
ages
in
their
tombs
wake
up
and
are
astonished
and
those
that
had
lain
hidden
in
dark
places
are
bathed
in
the
ray
of
unwonted
light
these
long
lifeless
books
once
most
dainty
but
now
become
corrupt
and
loathsome
covered
with
litters
of
mice
and
pierced
with
the
gnawings
of
the
worms
and
who
were
once
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
now
lying
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
given
up
to
oblivion
seemed
to
have
become
habitations
of
the
moth
natheless
among
these
seizing
the
opportunity
we
would
sit
down
with
more
delight
than
a
fastidious
physician
among
his
stores
of
gums
and
spices
and
there
we
found
the
object
and
the
stimulus
of
our
affections
thus
the
sacred
vessels
of
learning
came
into
our
control
and
stewardship
some
by
gift
others
by
purchase
and
some
lent
to
us
for
a
season
no
wonder
that
when
people
saw
that
we
were
contented
with
gifts
of
this
kind
they
were
anxious
of
their
own
accord
to
minister
to
our
needs
with
those
things
that
they
were
more
willing
to
dispense
with
than
the
things
they
secured
by
ministering
to
our
service
and
in
good
will
we
strove
so
to
forward
their
affairs
that
gain
accrued
to
them
while
justice
suffered
no
disparagement
indeed
if
we
had
loved
gold
and
silver
goblets
horses
or
no
small
sums
of
money
we
might
in
those
days
have
furnished
forth
a
rich
treasury
but
in
truth
we
wanted
manuscripts
not
moneyscripts
we
loved
codices
more
than
florins
and
preferred
slender
pamphlets
to
pampered
palfreys
besides
all
this
we
were
frequently
made
ambassador
of
this
most
illustrious
prince
of
everlasting
memory
and
were
sent
on
the
most
various
affairs
of
state
now
to
the
holy
see
now
to
the
court
of
france
and
again
to
various
powers
of
the
world
on
tedious
embassies
and
in
times
of
danger
always
carrying
with
us
however
that
love
of
books
which
many
waters
could
not
quench
for
this
like
a
delicious
draught
sweetened
the
bitterness
of
our
journeyings
and
after
the
perplexing
intricacies
and
troublesome
difficulties
of
causes
and
the
all
but
inextricable
labyrinths
of
public
affairs
afforded
us
a
little
breathing
space
to
enjoy
a
balmier
atmosphere
o
holy
god
of
gods
in
sion
what
a
mighty
stream
of
pleasure
made
glad
our
hearts
whenever
we
had
leisure
to
visit
paris
the
paradise
of
the
world
and
to
linger
there
where
the
days
seemed
ever
few
for
the
greatness
of
our
love
there
are
delightful
libraries
more
aromatic
than
stores
of
spicery
there
are
luxuriant
parks
of
all
manner
of
volumes
there
are
academic
meads
shaken
by
the
tramp
of
scholars
there
are
lounges
of
athens
walks
of
the
peripatetics
peaks
of
parnassus
and
porches
of
the
stoics
there
is
seen
the
surveyor
of
all
arts
and
sciences
aristotle
to
whom
belongs
all
that
is
most
excellent
in
doctrine
so
far
as
relates
to
this
passing
sublunary
world
there
ptolemy
measures
epicycles
and
eccentric
apogees
and
the
nodes
of
the
planets
by
figures
and
numbers
there
paul
reveals
the
mysteries
there
his
neighbour
dionysius
arranges
and
distinguishes
the
hierarchies
there
the
virgin
carmentis
reproduces
in
latin
characters
all
that
cadmus
collected
in
phoenician
letters
there
indeed
opening
our
treasuries
and
unfastening
our
we
scattered
money
with
joyous
heart
and
purchased
inestimable
books
with
mud
and
sand
it
is
naught
it
is
naught
saith
every
buyer
but
in
vain
for
behold
how
good
and
how
pleasant
it
is
to
gather
together
the
arms
of
the
clerical
warfare
that
we
may
have
the
means
to
crush
the
attacks
of
heretics
if
they
arise
further
we
are
aware
that
we
obtained
most
excellent
opportunities
of
collecting
in
the
following
way
from
our
early
years
we
attached
to
our
society
with
the
most
exquisite
solicitude
and
discarding
all
partiality
all
such
masters
and
scholars
and
professors
in
the
several
faculties
as
had
become
most
distinguished
by
their
subtlety
of
mind
and
the
fame
of
their
learning
deriving
consolation
from
their
sympathetic
conversation
we
were
delightfully
entertained
now
by
demonstrative
chains
of
reasoning
now
by
the
recital
of
physical
processes
and
the
treatises
of
the
doctors
of
the
church
now
by
stimulating
discourses
on
the
allegorical
meanings
of
things
as
by
a
rich
and
intellectual
feast
such
men
we
chose
as
comrades
in
our
years
of
learning
as
companions
in
our
chamber
as
associates
on
our
journeys
as
guests
at
our
table
and
in
short
as
helpmates
in
all
the
vicissitudes
of
life
but
as
no
happiness
is
permitted
to
endure
for
long
we
were
sometimes
deprived
of
the
bodily
companionship
of
some
of
these
shining
lights
when
justice
looking
down
from
heaven
the
ecclesiastical
preferments
and
dignities
that
they
deserved
fell
to
their
portion
and
thus
it
happened
as
was
only
right
that
in
attending
to
their
own
cures
they
were
obliged
to
absent
themselves
from
attendance
upon
us
we
will
add
yet
another
very
convenient
way
by
which
a
great
multitude
of
books
old
as
well
as
new
came
into
our
hands
for
we
never
regarded
with
disdain
or
disgust
the
poverty
of
the
mendicant
orders
adopted
for
the
sake
of
christ
but
in
all
parts
of
the
world
took
them
into
the
kindly
arms
of
our
compassion
allured
them
by
the
most
friendly
familiarity
into
devotion
to
ourselves
and
having
so
allured
them
cherished
them
with
munificent
liberality
of
beneficence
for
the
sake
of
god
becoming
benefactors
of
all
of
them
in
general
in
such
wise
that
we
seemed
none
the
less
to
have
adopted
certain
individuals
with
a
special
fatherly
affection
to
these
men
we
were
as
a
refuge
in
every
case
of
need
and
never
refused
to
them
the
shelter
of
our
favour
wherefore
we
deserved
to
find
them
most
special
furtherers
of
our
wishes
and
promoters
thereof
in
act
and
deed
who
compassing
land
and
sea
traversing
the
circuit
of
the
world
and
ransacking
the
universities
and
high
schools
of
various
provinces
were
zealous
in
combatting
for
our
desires
in
the
sure
and
certain
hope
of
reward
what
leveret
could
escape
amidst
so
many
hunters
what
little
fish
could
evade
in
turn
their
hooks
and
nets
and
snares
from
the
body
of
the
sacred
law
down
to
the
booklet
containing
the
fallacies
of
yesterday
nothing
could
escape
these
searchers
was
some
devout
discourse
uttered
at
the
of
christian
faith
the
holy
roman
curia
or
was
some
strange
question
ventilated
with
novel
arguments
did
the
solidity
of
paris
which
is
now
more
zealous
in
the
study
of
antiquity
than
in
the
subtle
investigation
of
truth
did
english
subtlety
which
illumined
by
the
lights
of
former
times
is
always
sending
forth
fresh
rays
of
truth
produce
anything
to
the
advancement
of
science
or
the
declaration
of
the
faith
this
was
instantly
poured
still
fresh
into
our
ears
ungarbled
by
any
babbler
unmutilated
by
any
trifler
but
passing
straight
from
the
purest
of
into
the
vats
of
our
memory
to
be
clarified
but
whenever
it
happened
that
we
turned
aside
to
the
cities
and
places
where
the
mendicants
we
have
mentioned
had
their
convents
we
did
not
disdain
to
visit
their
libraries
and
any
other
repositories
of
books
nay
there
we
found
heaped
up
amid
the
utmost
poverty
the
utmost
riches
of
wisdom
we
discovered
in
their
fardels
and
baskets
not
only
crumbs
falling
from
the
masters
table
for
the
dogs
but
the
shewbread
without
leaven
and
the
bread
of
angels
having
in
it
all
that
is
delicious
and
indeed
the
garners
of
joseph
full
of
corn
and
all
the
spoil
of
the
egyptians
and
the
very
precious
gifts
which
queen
sheba
brought
to
solomon
these
men
are
as
ants
ever
preparing
their
meat
in
the
summer
and
ingenious
bees
continually
fabricating
cells
of
honey
they
are
successors
of
bezaleel
in
devising
all
manner
of
workmanship
in
silver
and
gold
and
precious
stones
for
decorating
the
temple
of
the
church
they
are
cunning
embroiderers
who
fashion
the
breastplate
and
ephod
of
the
high
priest
and
all
the
various
vestments
of
the
priests
they
fashion
the
curtains
of
linen
and
hair
and
coverings
of
ram
skins
dyed
red
with
which
to
adorn
the
tabernacle
of
the
church
militant
they
are
husbandmen
that
sow
oxen
treading
out
corn
sounding
trumpets
shining
pleiades
and
stars
remaining
in
their
courses
which
cease
not
to
fight
against
sisera
and
to
pay
due
regard
to
truth
without
prejudice
to
the
judgment
of
any
although
they
lately
at
the
eleventh
hour
have
entered
the
lord
vineyard
as
the
books
that
are
so
fond
of
us
eagerly
declared
in
our
sixth
chapter
they
have
added
more
in
this
brief
hour
to
the
stock
of
the
sacred
books
than
all
the
other
following
in
the
footsteps
of
paul
the
last
to
be
called
but
the
first
in
preaching
who
spread
the
gospel
of
christ
more
widely
than
all
others
of
these
men
when
we
were
raised
to
the
episcopate
we
had
several
of
both
orders
the
preachers
and
minors
as
personal
attendants
and
companions
at
our
board
men
distinguished
no
less
in
letters
than
in
morals
who
devoted
themselves
with
unwearied
zeal
to
the
correction
exposition
tabulation
and
compilation
of
various
volumes
but
although
we
have
acquired
a
very
numerous
store
of
ancient
as
well
as
modern
works
by
the
manifold
intermediation
of
the
religious
yet
we
must
laud
the
preachers
with
special
praise
in
that
we
have
found
them
above
all
the
religious
most
freely
communicative
of
their
stores
without
jealousy
and
proved
them
to
be
imbued
with
an
almost
divine
liberality
not
greedy
but
fitting
possessors
of
luminous
wisdom
besides
all
the
opportunities
mentioned
above
we
secured
the
acquaintance
of
stationers
and
booksellers
not
only
within
our
own
country
but
of
those
spread
over
the
realms
of
france
germany
and
italy
money
flying
forth
in
abundance
to
anticipate
their
demands
nor
were
they
hindered
by
any
distance
or
by
the
fury
of
the
seas
or
by
the
lack
of
means
for
their
expenses
from
sending
or
bringing
to
us
the
books
that
we
required
for
they
well
knew
that
their
expectations
of
our
bounty
would
not
be
defrauded
but
that
ample
repayment
with
usury
was
to
be
found
with
us
nor
finally
did
our
good
fellowship
which
aimed
to
captivate
the
affection
of
all
overlook
the
rectors
of
schools
and
the
instructors
of
rude
boys
but
rather
when
we
had
an
opportunity
we
entered
their
little
plots
and
gardens
and
gathered
flowers
from
the
surface
and
dug
up
their
roots
obsolete
indeed
but
still
useful
to
the
student
which
might
when
their
rank
barbarism
was
digested
heal
the
pectoral
arteries
with
the
gift
of
eloquence
amongst
the
mass
of
these
things
we
found
some
greatly
meriting
to
be
restored
which
when
skilfully
cleansed
and
freed
from
the
disfiguring
rust
of
age
deserved
to
be
renovated
into
comeliness
of
aspect
and
applying
in
full
measure
the
necessary
means
as
a
type
of
the
resurrection
to
come
we
resuscitated
them
and
restored
them
again
to
new
life
and
health
moreover
we
had
always
in
our
different
manors
no
small
multitude
of
copyists
and
scribes
of
binders
correctors
illuminators
and
generally
of
all
who
could
usefully
labour
in
the
service
of
books
finally
all
of
both
sexes
and
of
every
rank
or
position
who
had
any
kind
of
association
with
books
could
most
easily
open
by
their
knocking
the
door
of
our
heart
and
find
a
fit
in
our
affection
and
favour
in
so
much
did
we
receive
those
who
brought
books
that
the
multitude
of
those
who
had
preceded
them
did
not
lessen
the
welcome
of
the
nor
were
the
favours
we
had
awarded
yesterday
prejudicial
to
those
of
wherefore
ever
using
all
the
persons
we
have
named
as
a
kind
of
magnets
to
attract
books
we
had
the
desired
accession
of
the
vessels
of
science
and
a
multitudinous
flight
of
the
finest
volumes
and
this
is
what
we
undertook
to
narrate
in
the
present
chapter
chapter
ix
how
although
we
preferred
the
works
of
the
ancients
we
have
not
condemned
the
studies
of
the
moderns
although
the
novelties
of
the
moderns
were
never
disagreeable
to
our
desires
who
have
always
cherished
with
grateful
affection
those
who
devote
themselves
to
study
and
who
add
anything
either
ingenious
or
useful
to
the
opinions
of
our
forefathers
yet
we
have
always
desired
with
more
undoubting
avidity
to
investigate
the
labours
of
the
ancients
for
whether
they
had
by
nature
a
greater
vigour
of
mental
sagacity
or
whether
they
perhaps
indulged
in
closer
application
to
study
or
whether
they
were
assisted
in
their
progress
by
both
these
things
one
thing
we
are
perfectly
clear
about
that
their
successors
are
barely
capable
of
discussing
the
discoveries
of
their
forerunners
and
of
acquiring
those
things
as
pupils
which
the
ancients
dug
out
by
difficult
efforts
of
discovery
for
as
we
read
that
the
men
of
old
were
of
a
more
excellent
degree
of
bodily
development
than
modern
times
are
found
to
produce
it
is
by
no
means
absurd
to
suppose
that
most
of
the
ancients
were
distinguished
by
brighter
faculties
seeing
that
in
the
labours
they
accomplished
of
both
kinds
they
are
inimitable
by
posterity
and
so
phocas
writes
in
the
prologue
to
his
grammar
since
all
things
have
been
said
by
men
of
sense
the
only
novelty
is
to
condense
but
in
truth
if
we
speak
of
fervour
of
learning
and
diligence
in
study
they
gave
up
all
their
lives
to
philosophy
while
nowadays
our
contemporaries
carelessly
spend
a
few
years
of
hot
youth
alternating
with
the
excesses
of
vice
and
when
the
passions
have
been
calmed
and
they
have
attained
the
capacity
of
discerning
truth
so
difficult
to
discover
they
soon
become
involved
in
worldly
affairs
and
retire
bidding
farewell
to
the
schools
of
philosophy
they
offer
the
fuming
must
of
their
youthful
intellect
to
the
difficulties
of
philosophy
and
bestow
the
clearer
wine
upon
the
business
of
life
further
as
ovid
in
the
first
book
of
the
de
vetula
justly
complains
the
hearts
of
all
men
after
gold
aspire
few
study
to
be
wise
more
to
acquire
thus
science
all
thy
virgin
charms
are
sold
whose
chaste
embraces
should
disdain
their
gold
who
seek
not
thee
thyself
but
pelf
through
thee
longing
for
riches
not
philosophy
and
further
on
thus
philosophy
is
seen
exiled
and
philopecuny
is
queen
which
is
known
to
be
the
most
violent
poison
of
learning
how
the
ancients
indeed
regarded
life
as
the
only
limit
of
study
is
shown
by
valerius
in
his
book
addressed
to
tiberius
by
many
examples
carneades
he
says
was
a
laborious
and
lifelong
soldier
of
wisdom
after
he
had
lived
ninety
years
the
same
day
put
an
end
to
his
life
and
his
philosophizing
isocrates
in
his
year
wrote
a
most
noble
work
sophocles
did
the
same
when
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
simonides
wrote
poems
in
his
eightieth
year
aulus
gellius
did
not
desire
to
live
longer
than
he
should
be
able
to
write
as
he
says
himself
in
the
prologue
to
the
noctes
atticae
the
fervour
of
study
which
possessed
euclid
the
socratic
taurus
the
philosopher
used
to
relate
to
incite
young
men
to
study
as
gellius
tells
in
the
book
we
have
mentioned
for
the
athenians
hating
the
people
of
megara
decreed
that
if
any
of
the
megarensians
entered
athens
he
should
be
put
to
death
then
euclid
who
was
a
megarensian
and
had
attended
the
lectures
of
socrates
before
this
decree
disguising
himself
in
a
woman
dress
used
to
go
from
megara
to
athens
by
night
to
hear
socrates
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
and
back
imprudent
and
excessive
was
the
fervour
of
archimedes
a
lover
of
geometry
who
would
not
declare
his
name
nor
lift
his
head
from
the
diagram
he
had
drawn
by
which
he
might
have
prolonged
his
life
but
thinking
more
of
study
than
of
life
dyed
with
his
the
figure
he
was
studying
there
are
very
many
such
examples
of
our
proposition
but
the
brevity
we
aim
at
does
not
allow
us
to
recall
them
but
painful
to
relate
the
clerks
who
are
famous
in
these
days
pursue
a
very
different
course
afflicted
with
ambition
in
their
tender
years
and
slightly
fastening
to
their
untried
arms
the
icarian
wings
of
presumption
they
prematurely
snatch
the
master
cap
and
mere
boys
become
unworthy
professors
of
the
several
faculties
through
which
they
do
not
make
their
way
step
by
step
but
like
goats
ascend
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
having
slightly
tasted
of
the
mighty
stream
they
think
that
they
have
drunk
it
dry
though
their
throats
are
hardly
moistened
and
because
they
are
not
grounded
in
the
first
rudiments
at
the
fitting
time
they
build
a
tottering
edifice
on
an
unstable
foundation
and
now
that
they
have
grown
up
they
are
ashamed
to
learn
what
they
ought
to
have
learned
while
young
and
thus
they
are
compelled
to
suffer
for
ever
for
too
hastily
jumping
at
dignities
they
have
not
deserved
for
these
and
the
like
reasons
the
tyros
in
the
schools
do
not
attain
to
the
solid
learning
of
the
ancients
in
a
few
short
hours
of
study
although
they
may
enjoy
distinctions
may
be
accorded
titles
be
authorized
by
official
robes
and
solemnly
installed
in
the
chairs
of
the
elders
just
snatched
from
the
cradle
and
hastily
weaned
they
mouth
the
rules
of
priscian
and
donatus
while
still
beardless
boys
they
gabble
with
childish
stammering
the
categorics
and
peri
hermeneias
in
the
writing
of
which
the
great
aristotle
is
said
to
have
dipped
his
pen
in
his
heart
blood
passing
through
these
faculties
with
baneful
haste
and
a
harmful
diploma
they
lay
violent
hands
upon
moses
and
sprinkling
about
their
faces
dark
waters
and
thick
clouds
of
the
skies
they
offer
their
heads
unhonoured
by
the
snows
of
age
for
the
mitre
of
the
pontificate
this
pest
is
greatly
encouraged
and
they
are
helped
to
attain
this
fantastic
clericate
with
such
nimble
steps
by
papal
provisions
obtained
by
insidious
prayers
and
also
by
the
prayers
which
may
not
be
rejected
of
cardinals
and
great
men
by
the
cupidity
of
friends
and
relatives
who
building
up
sion
in
blood
secure
ecclesiastical
dignities
for
their
nephews
and
pupils
before
they
are
seasoned
by
the
course
of
nature
or
ripeness
of
learning
alas
by
the
same
disease
which
we
are
deploring
we
see
that
the
palladium
of
paris
has
been
carried
off
in
these
sad
times
of
ours
wherein
the
zeal
of
that
noble
university
whose
rays
once
shed
light
into
every
corner
of
the
world
has
grown
lukewarm
nay
is
all
but
frozen
there
the
pen
of
every
scribe
is
now
at
rest
generations
of
books
no
longer
succeed
each
other
and
there
is
none
who
begins
to
take
place
as
a
new
author
they
wrap
up
their
doctrines
in
unskilled
discourse
and
are
losing
all
propriety
of
logic
except
that
our
english
subtleties
which
they
denounce
in
public
are
the
subject
of
their
furtive
vigils
admirable
minerva
seems
to
bend
her
course
to
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
and
reacheth
from
end
to
end
mightily
that
she
may
reveal
herself
to
all
mankind
we
see
that
she
has
already
visited
the
indians
the
babylonians
the
egyptians
and
greeks
the
arabs
and
the
romans
now
she
has
passed
by
paris
and
now
has
happily
come
to
britain
the
most
noble
of
islands
nay
rather
a
microcosm
in
itself
that
she
may
show
herself
a
debtor
both
to
the
greeks
and
to
the
barbarians
at
which
wondrous
sight
it
is
conceived
by
most
men
that
as
philosophy
is
now
lukewarm
in
france

her
soldiery
are
unmanned

chapter

of
the
gradual
perfecting
of
books
while
assiduously
seeking
out
the
wisdom
of
the
men
of
old
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
wise
man
eccles
xxxix
the
wise
man
he
says
will
seek
out
the
wisdom
of
all
the
ancients
we
have
not
thought
fit
to
be
misled
into
the
opinion
that
the
first
founders
of
the
arts
have
purged
away
all
crudeness
knowing
that
the
discoveries
of
each
of
the
faithful
when
weighed
in
a
faithful
balance
makes
a
tiny
portion
of
science
but
that
by
the
anxious
investigations
of
a
multitude
of
scholars
each
as
it
were
contributing
his
share
the
mighty
bodies
of
the
sciences
have
grown
by
successive
augmentations
to
the
immense
bulk
that
we
now
behold
for
the
disciples
continually
melting
down
the
doctrines
of
their
masters
and
passing
them
again
through
the
furnace
drove
off
the
dross
that
had
been
previously
overlooked
until
there
came
out
refined
gold
tried
in
a
furnace
of
earth
purified
seven
times
to
perfection
and
stained
by
no
admixture
of
error
or
doubt
for
not
even
aristotle
although
a
man
of
gigantic
intellect
in
whom
it
pleased
nature
to
try
how
much
of
reason
she
could
bestow
upon
mortality
and
whom
the
most
high
made
only
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
sucked
from
his
own
fingers
those
wonderful
volumes
which
the
whole
world
can
hardly
contain
but
on
the
contrary
with
penetration
he
had
seen
through
the
sacred
books
of
the
hebrews
the
babylonians
the
egyptians
the
chaldaeans
the
persians
and
the
medes
all
of
which
learned
greece
had
transferred
into
her
treasuries
whose
true
sayings
he
received
but
smoothed
away
their
crudities
pruned
their
superfluities
supplied
their
deficiencies
and
removed
their
errors
and
he
held
that
we
should
give
thanks
not
only
to
those
who
teach
rightly
but
even
to
those
who
err
as
affording
the
way
of
more
easily
investigating
truth
as
he
plainly
declares
in
the
second
book
of
his
metaphysics
thus
many
learned
lawyers
contributed
to
the
pandects
many
physicians
to
the
tegni
and
it
was
by
this
means
that
avicenna
edited
his
canon
and
pliny
his
great
work
on
natural
history
and
ptolemy
the
almagest
for
as
in
the
writers
of
annals
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
that
the
later
writer
always
presupposes
the
earlier
without
whom
he
could
by
no
means
relate
the
former
times
so
too
we
are
to
think
of
the
authors
of
the
sciences
for
no
man
by
himself
has
brought
forth
any
science
since
between
the
earliest
students
and
those
of
the
latter
time
we
find
intermediaries
ancient
if
they
be
compared
with
our
own
age
but
modern
if
we
think
of
the
foundations
of
learning
and
these
men
we
consider
the
most
learned
what
would
virgil
the
chief
poet
among
the
latins
have
achieved
if
he
had
not
despoiled
theocritus
lucretius
and
homer
and
had
not
ploughed
with
their
heifer
what
unless
again
and
again
he
had
read
somewhat
of
parthenius
and
pindar
whose
eloquence
he
could
by
no
means
imitate
what
could
sallust
tully
boethius
macrobius
lactantius
martianus
and
in
short
the
whole
troop
of
latin
writers
have
done
if
they
had
not
seen
the
productions
of
athens
or
the
volumes
of
the
greeks

little
would
jerome
master
of
three
languages
ambrosius
augustine
though
he
confesses
that
he
hated
greek
or
even
gregory
who
is
said
to
have
been
wholly
ignorant
of
it
have
contributed
to
the
doctrine
of
the
church
if
more
learned
greece
had
not
furnished
them
from
its
stores
as
rome
watered
by
the
streams
of
greece
had
earlier
brought
forth
philosophers
in
the
image
of
the
greeks
in
like
fashion
afterwards
it
produced
doctors
of
the
orthodox
faith
the
creeds
we
chant
are
the
sweat
of
grecian
brows
promulgated
by
their
councils
and
established
by
the
martyrdom
of
many
yet
their
natural
slowness
as
it
happens
turns
to
the
glory
of
the
latins
since
as
they
were
less
learned
in
their
studies
so
they
were
less
perverse
in
their
errors
in
truth
the
arian
heresy
had
all
but
eclipsed
the
whole
church
the
nestorian
wickedness
presumed
to
rave
with
blasphemous
rage
against
the
virgin
for
it
would
have
robbed
the
queen
of
heaven
not
in
open
fight
but
in
disputation
of
her
name
and
character
as
mother
of
god
unless
the
invincible
champion
cyril
ready
to
do
single
battle
with
the
help
of
the
council
of
ephesus
had
in
vehemence
of
spirit
utterly
extinguished
it
innumerable
are
the
forms
as
well
as
the
authors
of
greek
heresies
for
as
they
were
the
original
cultivators
of
our
holy
faith
so
too
they
were
the
first
sowers
of
tares
as
is
shown
by
veracious
history
and
thus
they
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
because
in
endeavouring
to
part
the
seamless
vesture
of
the
lord
they
totally
destroyed
primitive
simplicity
of
doctrine
and
blinded
by
the
darkness
of
novelty
would
fall
into
the
bottomless
pit
unless
he
provide
for
them
in
his
inscrutable
prerogative
whose
wisdom
is
past
reckoning
let
this
suffice
for
here
we
reach
the
limit
of
our
power
of
judgment
one
thing
however
we
conclude
from
the
premises
that
the
ignorance
of
the
greek
tongue
is
now
a
great
hindrance
to
the
study
of
the
latin
writers
since
without
it
the
doctrines
of
the
ancient
authors
whether
christian
or
gentile
can
not
be
understood
and
we
must
come
to
a
like
judgment
as
to
arabic
in
numerous
astronomical
treatises
and
as
to
hebrew
as
regards
the
text
of
the
holy
bible
which
deficiencies
indeed
clement
provides
for
if
only
the
bishops
would
faithfully
observe
what
they
so
lightly
decree
wherefore
we
have
taken
care
to
provide
a
greek
as
well
as
a
hebrew
grammar
for
our
scholars
with
certain
other
aids
by
the
help
of
which
studious
readers
may
greatly
inform
themselves
in
the
writing
reading
and
understanding
of
the
said
tongues
although
only
the
hearing
of
them
can
teach
correctness
of
idiom
chapter
xi
why
we
have
preferred
books
of
liberal
learning
to
books
of
law
that
lucrative
practice
of
positive
law
designed
for
the
dispensation
of
earthly
things
the
more
useful
it
is
found
by
the
children
of
this
world
so
much
the
less
does
it
aid
the
children
of
light
in
comprehending
the
mysteries
of
holy
writ
and
the
secret
sacraments
of
the
faith
seeing
that
it
disposes
us
peculiarly
to
the
friendship
of
the
world
by
which
man
as
james
testifies
is
made
the
enemy
of
god
law
indeed
encourages
rather
than
extinguishes
the
contentions
of
mankind
which
are
the
result
of
unbounded
greed
by
complicated
laws
which
can
be
turned
either
way
though
we
know
that
it
was
created
by
jurisconsults
and
pious
princes
for
the
purpose
of
assuaging
these
contentions
but
in
truth
as
the
same
science
deals
with
contraries
and
the
power
of
reason
can
be
used
to
opposite
ends
and
at
the
same
the
human
mind
is
more
inclined
to
evil
it
happens
with
the
practisers
of
this
science
that
they
usually
devote
themselves
to
promoting
contention
rather
than
peace
and
instead
of
quoting
laws
according
to
the
intent
of
the
legislator
violently
strain
the
language
thereof
to
effect
their
own
purposes
wherefore
although
the
love
of
books
has
possessed
our
mind
from
boyhood
and
to
rejoice
in
their
delights
has
been
our
only
pleasure
yet
the
appetite
for
the
books
of
the
civil
law
took
less
hold
of
our
affections
and
we
have
spent
but
little
labour
and
expense
in
acquiring
volumes
of
this
kind
for
they
are
useful
only
as
the
scorpion
in
treacle
as
aristotle
the
sun
of
science
has
said
of
logic
in
his
book
de
pomo
we
have
noticed
a
certain
manifest
difference
of
nature
between
law
and
science
in
that
every
science
is
delighted
and
desires
to
open
its
inward
parts
and
display
the
very
heart
of
its
principles
and
to
show
forth
the
roots
from
which
it
buds
and
flourishes
and
that
the
emanation
of
its
springs
may
be
seen
of
all
men
for
thus
from
the
cognate
and
harmonious
light
of
the
truth
of
conclusion
to
principles
the
whole
body
of
science
will
be
full
of
light
having
no
part
dark
but
laws
on
the
contrary
since
they
are
only
human
enactments
for
the
regulation
of
social
life
or
the
yokes
of
princes
thrown
over
the
necks
of
their
subjects
refuse
to
be
brought
to
the
standard
of
synteresis
the
origin
of
equity
because
they
feel
that
they
possess
more
of
arbitrary
will
than
rational
judgment
wherefore
the
judgment
of
the
wise
for
the
most
part
is
that
the
causes
of
laws
are
not
a
fit
subject
of
discussion
in
truth
many
laws
acquire
force
by
mere
custom
not
by
syllogistic
necessity
like
the
arts
as
aristotle
the
phoebus
of
the
schools
urges
in
the
second
book
of
the
politics
where
he
confutes
the
policy
of
hippodamus
which
holds
out
rewards
to
the
inventors
of
new
laws
because
to
abrogate
old
laws
and
establish
new
ones
is
to
weaken
the
force
of
those
which
exist
for
whatever
receives
its
stability
from
use
alone
must
necessarily
be
brought
to
nought
by
disuse
from
which
it
is
seen
clearly
enough
that
as
laws
are
neither
arts
nor
sciences
so
books
of
law
can
not
properly
be
called
books
of
art
or
science
nor
is
this
faculty
which
we
may
call
by
a
special
term
geologia
or
the
earthly
science
to
be
properly
numbered
among
the
sciences
now
the
books
of
the
liberal
arts
are
so
useful
to
the
divine
writings
that
without
their
aid
the
intellect
would
vainly
aspire
to
understand
them
chapter
xii
why
we
have
caused
books
of
grammar
to
be
so
diligently
prepared
while
we
were
constantly
delighting
ourselves
with
the
reading
of
books
which
it
was
our
custom
to
read
or
have
read
to
us
every
day
we
noticed
plainly
how
much
the
defective
knowledge
even
of
a
single
word
hinders
the
understanding
as
the
meaning
of
no
sentence
can
be
apprehended
if
any
part
of
it
be
not
understood
wherefore
we
ordered
the
meanings
of
foreign
words
to
be
noted
with
particular
care
and
studied
the
orthography
prosody
etymology
and
syntax
in
ancient
grammarians
with
unrelaxing
carefulness
and
took
pains
to
elucidate
terms
that
had
grown
too
obscure
by
age
with
suitable
explanations
in
order
to
make
a
smooth
path
for
our
students
this
is
the
whole
reason
why
we
took
care
to
replace
the
antiquated
volumes
of
the
grammarians
by
improved
codices
that
we
might
make
royal
roads
by
which
our
scholars
in
time
to
come
might
attain
without
stumbling
to
any
science
chapter
xiii
why
we
have
not
wholly
neglected
the
fables
of
the
poets
all
the
varieties
of
attack
directed
against
the
poets
by
the
lovers
of
naked
truth
may
be
repelled
by
a
defence
either
that
even
in
an
unseemly
we
may
learn
a
charming
fashion
of
speech
or
that
where
a
fictitious
but
becoming
subject
is
handled
natural
or
historical
truth
is
pursued
under
the
guise
of
allegorical
fiction
although
it
is
true
that
all
men
naturally
desire
knowledge
yet
they
do
not
all
take
the
same
pleasure
in
learning
on
the
contrary
when
they
have
experienced
the
labour
of
study
and
find
their
senses
wearied
most
men
inconsiderately
fling
away
the
nut
before
they
have
broken
the
shell
and
reached
the
kernel
for
man
is
naturally
fond
of
two
things
namely
freedom
from
control
and
some
pleasure
in
his
activity
for
which
reason
no
one
without
reason
submits
himself
to
the
control
of
others
or
willingly
engages
in
any
tedious
task
for
pleasure
crowns
activity
as
beauty
is
a
crown
to
youth
as
aristotle
truly
asserts
in
the
tenth
book
of
the
ethics
accordingly
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
devised
a
remedy
by
which
to
entice
the
wanton
minds
of
men
by
a
kind
of
pious
fraud
the
delicate
minerva
secretly
lurking
beneath
the
mask
of
pleasure
we
are
wont
to
allure
children
by
rewards
that
they
may
cheerfully
learn
what
we
force
them
to
study
even
though
they
are
unwilling
for
our
fallen
nature
does
not
tend
to
virtue
with
the
same
enthusiasm
with
which
it
rushes
into
vice
horace
has
expressed
this
for
us
in
a
brief
verse
of
the
ars
poetica
where
he
says
all
poets
sing
to
profit
or
delight
and
he
has
plainly
intimated
the
same
thing
in
another
verse
of
the
same
book
where
he
says
he
hits
the
mark
who
mingles
joy
with
use
how
many
students
of
euclid
have
been
repelled
by
the
pons
asinorum
as
by
a
lofty
and
precipitous
rock
which
no
help
of
ladders
could
enable
them
to
scale
this
is
a
hard
saying
they
exclaim
and
who
can
receive
it
the
child
of
inconstancy
who
ended
by
wishing
to
be
transformed
into
an
ass
would
perhaps
never
have
given
up
the
study
of
philosophy
if
he
had
met
him
in
friendly
guise
veiled
under
the
cloak
of
pleasure
but
anon
astonished
by
crato
chair
and
struck
dumb
by
his
endless
questions
as
by
a
sudden
thunderbolt
he
saw
no
refuge
but
in
flight
so
much
we
have
alleged
in
defence
of
the
poets
and
now
we
proceed
to
show
that
those
who
study
them
with
proper
intent
are
not
to
be
condemned
in
regard
to
them
for
our
ignorance
of
one
single
word
prevents
the
understanding
of
a
whole
long
sentence
as
was
assumed
in
the
previous
chapter
as
now
the
sayings
of
the
saints
frequently
allude
to
the
inventions
of
the
poets
it
must
needs
happen
that
through
our
not
knowing
the
poem
referred
to
the
whole
meaning
of
the
author
is
completely
obscured
and
assuredly
as
cassiodorus
says
in
his
book
of
the
institutes
of
sacred
literature
those
things
are
not
to
be
considered
trifles
without
which
great
things
can
not
come
to
pass
it
follows
therefore
that
through
ignorance
of
poetry
we
do
not
understand
jerome
augustine
boethius
lactantius
sidonius
and
very
many
others
a
catalogue
of
whom
would
more
than
fill
a
long
chapter
the
venerable
bede
has
very
clearly
discussed
and
determined
this
doubtful
point
as
is
related
by
that
great
compiler
gratian
the
repeater
of
numerous
authors
who
is
as
confused
in
form
as
he
was
eager
in
collecting
matter
for
his
compilation
now
he
writes
in
his
section
some
read
secular
literature
for
pleasure
taking
delight
in
the
inventions
and
elegant
language
of
the
poets
but
others
study
this
literature
for
the
sake
of
scholarship
that
by
their
reading
they
may
learn
to
detest
the
errors
of
the
gentiles
and
may
devoutly
apply
what
they
find
useful
in
them
to
the
use
of
sacred
learning
such
men
study
secular
literature
in
a
laudable
manner
so
far
bede
taking
this
salutary
instruction
to
heart
let
the
detractors
of
those
who
study
the
poets
henceforth
hold
their
peace
and
let
not
those
who
are
ignorant
of
these
things
require
that
others
should
be
as
ignorant
as
themselves
for
this
is
the
consolation
of
the
wretched
and
therefore
let
every
man
see
that
his
own
intentions
are
upright
and
he
may
thus
make
of
any
subject
observing
the
limitations
of
virtue
a
study
acceptable
to
god
and
if
he
have
found
profit
in
poetry
as
the
great
virgil
relates
that
he
had
done
in
ennius
he
will
not
have
done
amiss
chapter
xiv
who
ought
to
be
special
lovers
of
books
to
him
who
recollects
what
has
been
said
before
it
is
plain
and
evident
who
ought
to
be
the
chief
lovers
of
books
for
those
who
have
most
need
of
wisdom
in
order
to
perform
usefully
the
duties
of
their
position
they
are
without
doubt
most
especially
bound
to
show
more
abundantly
to
the
sacred
vessels
of
wisdom
the
anxious
affection
of
a
grateful
heart
now
it
is
the
office
of
the
wise
man
to
order
rightly
both
himself
and
others
according
to
the
phoebus
of
philosophers
aristotle
who
deceives
not
nor
is
deceived
in
human
things
wherefore
princes
and
prelates
judges
and
doctors
and
all
other
leaders
of
the
commonwealth
as
more
than
others
they
have
need
of
wisdom
so
more
than
others
ought
they
to
show
zeal
for
the
vessels
of
wisdom
boethius
indeed
beheld
philosophy
bearing
a
sceptre
in
her
left
hand
and
books
in
her
right
by
which
it
is
evidently
shown
to
all
men
that
no
one
can
rightly
rule
a
commonwealth
without
books
thou
says
boethius
speaking
to
philosophy
hast
sanctioned
this
saying
by
the
mouth
of
plato
that
states
would
be
happy
if
they
were
ruled
by
students
of
philosophy
or
if
their
rulers
would
study
philosophy
and
again
we
are
taught
by
the
very
gesture
of
the
figure
that
in
so
far
as
the
right
hand
is
better
than
the
left
so
far
the
contemplative
life
is
more
worthy
than
the
active
life
and
at
the
same
time
we
are
shown
that
the
business
of
the
wise
man
is
to
devote
himself
by
turns
now
to
the
study
of
truth
and
now
to
the
dispensation
of
temporal
things
we
read
that
philip
thanked
the
gods
devoutly
for
having
granted
that
alexander
should
be
born
in
the
time
of
aristotle
so
that
educated
under
his
instruction
he
might
be
worthy
to
rule
his
father
empire
while
phaeton
unskilled
in
driving
becomes
the
charioteer
of
his
father
car
he
unhappily
distributes
to
mankind
the
heat
of
phoebus
now
by
excessive
nearness
and
now
by
withdrawing
it
too
far
and
so
lest
all
beneath
him
should
be
imperilled
by
the
closeness
of
his
driving
justly
deserved
to
be
struck
by
the
thunderbolt
the
history
of
the
greeks
as
well
as
romans
shows
that
there
were
no
famous
princes
among
them
who
were
devoid
of
literature
the
sacred
law
of
moses
in
prescribing

made

xvii
according
to
the
copy
shown
by
the

in
which
he
was
to

certes
god
himself
who
hath
made
and
who
fashioneth
every
day
the
hearts
of
every
one
of
us
knows
the
feebleness
of
human
memory
and
the
instability
of
virtuous
intentions
in
mankind
wherefore
he
has
willed
that
books
should
be
as
it
were
an
antidote
to
all
evil

reading
and
use
of
which
he
has

by

plead
the
stammering
of
moses
or
with
jeremiah
will
confess
that
he
is
but
a
boy
and
can
not
speak
or
will
imitate
echo
rebounding
from
the
mountains
for
we
know
that
the
love
of
books
is
the
same
thing
as
the
love
of
wisdom
as
was
proved
in
the
second
chapter
now
this
love
is
called
by
the
greek
word
philosophy
the
whole
virtue
of
which
no
created
intelligence
can
comprehend
for
she
is
believed
to
be
the
mother
of
all
good
things
wisdom
vii
she
as
a
heavenly
dew
extinguishes
the
heats
of
fleshly
vices
the
intense
activity
of
the
mental
forces
relaxing
the
vigour
of
the
animal
forces
and
slothfulness
being
wholly
put
to
flight
which
being
gone
all
the
bows
of
cupid
are
unstrung
hence
plato
says
in
the
phaedo
the
philosopher
is
manifest
in
this
that
he
dissevers
the
soul
from
communion
with
the
body
love
says
jerome
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
and
thou
wilt
not
love
the
vices
of
the
flesh
the
godlike
xenocrates
showed
this
by
the
firmness
of
his
reason
who
was
declared
by
the
famous
hetaera
phryne
to
be
a
statue
and
not
a
man
when
all
her
blandishments
could
not
shake
his
resolve
as
valerius
maximus
relates
at
length
our
own
origen
showed
this
also
who
chose
rather
to
be
unsexed
by
the
mutilation
of
himself
than
to
be
made
effeminate
by
the
omnipotence
of
woman
though
it
was
a
hasty
remedy
repugnant
alike
to
nature
and
to
virtue
whose
place
it
is
not
to
make
men
insensible
to
passion
but
to
slay
with
the
dagger
of
reason
the
passions
that
spring
from
instinct
again
all
who
are
smitten
with
the
love
of
books
think
cheaply
of
the
world
and
wealth
as
jerome
says
to
vigilantius
the
same
man
can
not
love
both
gold
and
books
and
thus
it
has
been
said
in
verse
no
hand
is
fit
to
handle
books
nor
he
whose
heart
on
gold
so
gladly
looks
the
same
men
love
not
books
and
money
both
and
books
thy
herd
o
epicurus
loathe
misers
and
bookmen
make
poor
company
nor
dwell
in
peace
beneath
the
same
no
man
therefore
can
serve
both
books
and
mammon
the
hideousness
of
vice
is
greatly
reprobated
in
books
so
that
he
who
loves
to
commune
with
books
is
led
to
detest
all
manner
of
vice
the
demon
who
derives
his
name
from
knowledge
is
most
effectually
defeated
by
the
knowledge
of
books
and
through
books
his
multitudinous
deceits
and
the
endless
labyrinths
of
his
guile
are
laid
bare
to
those
who
read
lest
he
be
transformed
into
an
angel
of
light
and
circumvent
the
innocent
by
his
wiles
the
reverence
of
god
is
revealed
to
us
by
books
the
virtues
by
which
he
is
worshipped
are
more
expressly
manifested
and
the
rewards
are
described
that
are
promised
by
the
truth
which
deceives
not
neither
is
deceived
the
truest
likeness
of
the
beatitude
to
come
is
the
contemplation
of
the
sacred
writings
in
which
we
behold
in
turn
the
creator
and
the
creature
and
draw
from
streams
of
perpetual
gladness
faith
is
established
by
the
power
of
books
hope
is
strengthened
by
their
solace
insomuch
that
by
patience
and
the
consolation
of
scripture
we
are
in
good
hope
charity
is
not
puffed
up
but
is
edified
by
the
knowledge
of
true
learning
and
indeed
it
is
clearer
than
light
that
the
church
is
established
upon
the
sacred
writings
books
delight
us
when
prosperity
smiles
upon
us
they
comfort
us
inseparably
when
stormy
fortune
frowns
on
us
they
lend
validity
to
human
compacts
and
no
serious
judgments
are
propounded
without
their
help
arts
and
sciences
all
the
advantages
of
which
no
mind
can
enumerate
consist
in
books
how
highly
must
we
estimate
the
wondrous
power
of
books
since
through
them
we
survey
the
utmost
bounds
of
the
world
and
time
and
contemplate
the
things
that
are
as
well
as
those
that
are
not
as
it
were
in
the
mirror
of
eternity
in
books
we
climb
mountains
and
scan
the
deepest
gulfs
of
the
abyss
in
books
we
behold
the
finny
tribes
that
may
not
exist
outside
their
native
waters
distinguish
the
properties
of
streams
and
springs
and
of
various
lands
from
books
we
dig
out
gems
and
metals
and
the
materials
of
every
kind
of
mineral
and
learn
the
virtues
of
herbs
and
trees
and
plants
and
survey
at
will
the
whole
progeny
of
neptune
ceres
and
pluto
but
if
we
please
to
visit
the
heavenly
inhabitants
taurus
caucasus
and
olympus
are
at
hand
from
which
we
pass
beyond
the
realms
of
juno
and
mark
out
the
territories
of
the
seven
planets
by
lines
and
circles
and
finally
we
traverse
the
loftiest
firmament
of
all
adorned
with
signs
degrees
and
figures
in
the
utmost
variety
there
we
inspect
the
antarctic
pole
which
eye
hath
not
seen
nor
ear
heard
we
admire
the
luminous
milky
way
and
the
zodiac
marvellously
and
delightfully
pictured
with
celestial
animals
thence
by
books
we
pass
on
to
separate
substances
that
the
intellect
may
greet
kindred
intelligences
and
with
the
mind
eye
may
discern
the
first
cause
of
all
things
and
the
unmoved
mover
of
infinite
virtue
and
may
immerse
itself
in
love
without
end
see
how
with
the
aid
of
books
we
attain
the
reward
of
our
beatitude
while
we
are
yet
sojourners
below
why
need
we
say
more
certes
just
as
we
have
learnt
on
the
authority
of
seneca
leisure
without
letters
is
death
and
the
sepulture
of
the
living
so
contrariwise
we
conclude
that
occupation
with
letters
or
books
is
the
life
of
man
again
by
means
of
books
we
communicate
to
friends
as
well
as
foes
what
we
can
not
safely
entrust
to
messengers
since
the
book
is
generally
allowed
access
to
the
chambers
of
princes
from
which
the
voice
of
its
author
would
be
rigidly
excluded
as
tertullian
observes
at
the
beginning
of
his
apologeticus
when
shut
up
in
prison
and
in
bonds
and
utterly
deprived
of
bodily
liberty
we
use
books
as
ambassadors
to
our
friends
and
entrust
them
with
the
conduct
of
our
cause
and
send
them
where
to
go
ourselves
would
incur
the
penalty
of
death
by
the
aid
of
books
we
remember
things
that
are
past
and
even
prophesy
as
to
the
future
and
things
present
which
shift
and
flow
we
perpetuate
by
committing
them
to
writing
the
felicitous
studiousness
and
the
studious
felicity
of
the
eunuch
of
whom
we
are
told
in
the
acts
who
had
been
so
mightily
kindled
by
the
love
of
the
prophetic
writings
that
he
ceased
not
from
his
reading
by
reason
of
his
journey
had
banished
all
thought
of
the
populous
palace
of
queen
candace
and
had
forgotten
even
the
treasures
of
which
he
was
the
keeper
and
had
neglected
alike
his
journey
and
the
chariot
in
which
he
rode
love
of
his
book
alone
had
wholly
engrossed
this
domicile
of
chastity
under
whose
guidance
he
soon
deserved
to
enter
the
gate
of
faith
o
gracious
love
of
books
which
by
the
grace
of
baptism
transformed
the
child
of
gehenna
and
nursling
of
tartarus
into
a
son
of
the
kingdom
let
the
feeble
pen
now
cease
from
the
tenor
of
an
infinite
task
lest
it
seem
foolishly
to
undertake
what
in
the
beginning
it
confessed
to
be
impossible
to
any
chapter
xvi
that
it
is
meritorious
to
write
new
books
and
to
renew
the
old
just
as
it
is
necessary
for
the
state
to
prepare
arms
and
to
provide
abundant
stores
of
victuals
for
the
soldiers
who
are
to
fight
for
it
so
it
is
fitting
for
the
church
militant
to
fortify
itself
against
the
assaults
of
pagans
and
heretics
with
a
multitude
of
sound
writings
but
because
all
the
appliances
of
mortal
men
with
the
lapse
of
time
suffer
the
decay
of
mortality
it
is
needful
to
replace
the
volumes
that
are
worn
out
with
age
by
fresh
successors
that
the
perpetuity
of
which
the
individual
is
by
its
nature
incapable
may
be
secured
to
the
species
and
hence
it
is
that
the
preacher
says
of
making
many
books
there
is
no
end
for
as
the
bodies
of
books
seeing
that
they
are
formed
of
a
combination
of
contrary
elements
undergo
a
continual
dissolution
of
their
structure
so
by
the
forethought
of
the
clergy
a
remedy
should
be
found
by
means
of
which
the
sacred
book
paying
the
debt
of
nature
may
obtain
a
natural
heir
and
may
raise
up
like
seed
to
its
dead
brother
and
thus
may
be
verified
that
saying
of
ecclesiasticus
his
father
is
dead
and
he
is
as
if
he
were
not
dead
for
he
hath
left
one
behind
him
that
is
like
himself
and
thus
the
transcription
of
ancient
books
is
as
it
were
the
begetting
of
fresh
sons
on
whom
the
office
of
the
father
may
devolve
lest
it
suffer
detriment
now
such
transcribers
are
called
antiquarii
whose
occupations
cassiodorus
confesses
please
him
above
all
the
tasks
of
bodily
labour
adding
happy
effort
he
says
laudable
industry
to
preach
to
men
with
the
hand
to
let
loose
tongues
with
the
fingers
silently
to
give
salvation
to
mortals
and
to
fight
with
pen
and
ink
against
the
illicit
wiles
of
the
evil
one
so
far
cassiodorus
moreover
our
saviour
exercised
the
office
of
the
scribe
when
he
stooped
down
and
with
his
finger
wrote
on
the
ground
john
viii
that
no
one
however
exalted
may
think
it
unworthy
of
him
to
do
what
he
sees
the
wisdom
of
god
the
father
did
o
singular
serenity
of
writing
to
practise
which
the
artificer
of
the
world
stoops
down
at
whose
dread
name
every
knee
doth
bow
o
venerable
handicraft
above
all
other
crafts
that
are
practised
by
the
hand
of
man
to
which
our
lord
humbly
inclines
his
breast
to
which
the
finger
of
god
is
applied
performing
the
office
of
a
pen
we
do
not
read
of
the
son
of
god
that
he
sowed
or
ploughed
wove
or
digged
nor
did
any
other
of
the
mechanic
arts
befit
the
divine
wisdom
incarnate
except
to
trace
letters
in
writing
that
every
gentleman
and
sciolist
may
know
that
fingers
are
given
by
god
to
men
for
the
task
of
writing
rather
than
for
war
wherefore
we
entirely
approve
the
judgment
of
books
wherein
they
declared
in
our
sixth
chapter
the
clerk
who
can
not
write
to
be
as
it
were
disabled

christ

what

so
the
office
of
the
writer
is
enjoined
on
isaiah
and
on
joshua
that
the
act
and
skill
of
writing
may
be
commended
to
future
generations
christ

has
written
on
his

and
on
his
thigh
king
of

and

of

so
that
without

the
royal
ornaments
of
the
omnipotent
can
not
be
made
perfect
being
dead
they
cease
not
to
teach
who
write
books
of
sacred
learning
paul
did
more
for
building
up
the
fabric
of
the
church
by
writing
his
holy
epistles
than
by
preaching
by
word
of
mouth
to
jews
and
gentiles
he
who
has
attained
the
prize
continues
daily
by
books
what
he
long
ago
began
while
a
sojourner
upon
the
earth
and
thus
is
fulfilled
in
the
doctors
writing
books
the
saying
of
the
prophet
they
that
turn
many
to
righteousness
shall
be
as
the
stars
for
ever
and
ever
moreover
it
has
been
determined
by
the
doctors
of
the
church
that
the
longevity
of
the
ancients
before
god
destroyed
the
original
world
by
the
deluge
is
to
be
ascribed
to
a
miracle
and
not
to
nature
as
though
god
granted
to
them
such
length
of
days
as
was
required
for
finding
out
the
sciences
and
writing
them
in
books
amongst
which
the
wonderful
variety
of
astronomy
required
according
to
josephus
a
period
of
six
hundred
years
to
submit
it
to
ocular
observation
nor
indeed
do
they
deny
that
the
fruits
of
the
earth
in
that
primitive
age
afforded
a
more
nutritious
aliment
to
men
than
in
our
modern
times
and
thus
they
had
not
only
a
livelier
energy
of
body
but
also
a
more
lengthened
period
of
vigour
to
which
it
contributed
not
a
little
that
they
lived
according
to
virtue
and
denied
themselves
all
luxurious
delights
whoever
therefore
is
by
the
good
gift
of
god
endowed
with
gift
of
science
let
him
according
to
the
counsel
of
the
holy
spirit
write
wisdom
in
his
time
of
leisure
eccles
xxxviii
that
his
reward
may
be
with
the
blessed
and
his
days
may
be
lengthened
in
this
present
world
and
further
if
we
turn
our
discourse
to
the
princes
of
the
world
we
find
that
famous
emperors
not
only
attained
excellent
skill
in
the
art
of
writing
but
indulged
greatly
in
its
practice
julius
caesar
the
first
and
greatest
of
them

left
us
commentaries
on
the
gallic
and
the

wars
written
by
himself
he
wrote
also
two
books
de
analogia
and
two
books
of
anticatones
and
a
poem
called
iter
and
many
other
works
julius
and
augustus
devised
means
of
writing
one
letter
for
another
and
so
concealing
what
they
wrote
for
julius
put
the
fourth
letter
for
the
first
and
so
on
through
the
alphabet
whilst
augustus
used
the
second
for
the
first
the
third
for
the
second
and
so
throughout
he
is
said
in
the
greatest
difficulties
of
affairs
during
the
mutinensian
war
to
have
read
and
written
and
even
declaimed
every
day
tiberius
wrote
a
lyric
poem
and
some
greek
verses
claudius
likewise
was
skilled
in
both
greek
and
latin
and
wrote
several
books
but
titus
was
skilled
above
all
men
in
the
art
of
writing
and
easily
imitated
any
hand
he
chose
so
that
he
used
to
say
that
if
he
had
wished
it
he
might
have
become
a
most
skilful
forger
all
these
things
are
noted
by
suetonius
in
his
lives
of
the
xii
caesars
chapter
xvii
of
showing
due
propriety
in
the
custody
of
books
we
are
not
only
rendering
service
to
god
in
preparing
volumes
of
new
books
but
also
exercising
an
office
of
sacred
piety
when
we
treat
books
carefully
and
again
when
we
restore
them
to
their
proper
places
and
commend
them
to
inviolable
custody
that
they
may
rejoice
in
purity
while
we
have
them
in
our
hands
and
rest
securely
when
they
are
put
back
in
their
repositories
and
surely
next
to
the
vestments
and
vessels
dedicated
to
the
lord
body
holy
books
deserve
to
be
rightly
treated
by
the
clergy
to
which
great
injury
is
done
so
often
as
they
are
touched
by
unclean
hands
wherefore
we
deem
it
expedient
to
warn
our
students
of
various
negligences
which
might
always
be
easily
avoided
and
do
wonderful
harm
to
books
and
in
the
first
place
as
to
the
opening
and
closing
of
books
let
there
be
due
moderation
that
they
be
not
unclasped
in
precipitate
haste
nor
when
we
have
finished
our
inspection
be
put
away
without
being
duly
closed
for
it
behoves
us
to
guard
a
book
much
more
carefully
than
a
boot
but
the
race
of
scholars
is
commonly
badly
brought
up
and
unless
they
are
bridled
in
by
the
rules
of
their
elders
they
indulge
in
infinite
puerilities
they
behave
with
petulance
and
are
puffed
up
with
presumption
judging
of
everything
as
if
they
were
certain
though
they
are
altogether
inexperienced
you
may
happen
to
see
some
headstrong
youth
lazily
lounging
over
his
studies
and
when
the
winter
frost
is
sharp
his
nose
running
from
the
nipping
cold
drips
down
nor
does
he
think
of
wiping
it
with
his
until
he
has
bedewed
the
book
before
him
with
the
ugly
moisture
would
that
he
had
before
him
no
book
but
a
apron
his
nails
are
stuffed
with
fetid
filth
as
black
as
jet
with
which
he
marks
any
passage
that
pleases
him
he
distributes
a
multitude
of
straws
which
he
inserts
to
stick
out
in
different
places
so
that
the
halm
may
remind
him
of
what
his
memory
can
not
retain
these
straws
because
the
book
has
no
stomach
to
digest
them
and
no
one
takes
them
out
first
distend
the
book
from
its
wonted
closing
and
at
length
being
carelessly
abandoned
to
oblivion
go
to
decay
he
does
not
fear
to
eat
fruit
or
cheese
over
an
open
book
or
carelessly
to
carry
a
cup
to
and
from
his
mouth
and
because
he
has
no
wallet
at
hand
he
drops
into
books
the
fragments
that
are
left
continually
chattering
he
is
never
weary
of
disputing
with
his
companions
and
while
he
alleges
a
crowd
of
senseless
arguments
he
wets
the
book
lying
half
open
in
his
lap
with
sputtering
showers
aye
and
then
hastily
folding
his
arms
he
leans
forward
on
the
book
and
by
a
brief
spell
of
study
invites
a
prolonged
nap
and
then
by
way
of
mending
the
wrinkles
he
folds
back
the
margin
of
the
leaves
to
the
no
small
injury
of
the
book
now
the
rain
is
over
and
gone
and
the
flowers
have
appeared
in
our
land
then
the
scholar
we
are
speaking
of
a
neglecter
rather
than
an
inspecter
of
books
will
stuff
his
volume
with
violets
and
primroses
with
roses
and
quatrefoil
then
he
will
use
his
wet
and
perspiring
hands
to
turn
over
the
volumes
then
he
will
thump
the
white
vellum
with
gloves
covered
with
all
kinds
of
dust
and
with
his
finger
clad
in
leather
will
hunt
line
by
line
through
the
page
then
at
the
sting
of
the
biting
flea
the
sacred
book
is
flung
aside
and
is
hardly
shut
for
another
month
until
it
is
so
full
of
the
dust
that
has
found
its
way
within
that
it
resists
the
effort
to
close
it
but
the
handling
of
books
is
specially
to
be
forbidden
to
those
shameless
youths
who
as
soon
as
they
have
learned
to
form
the
shapes
of
letters
straightway
if
they
have
the
opportunity
become
unhappy
commentators
and
wherever
they
find
an
extra
margin
about
the
text
furnish
it
with
monstrous
alphabets
or
if
any
other
frivolity
strikes
their
fancy
at
once
their
pen
begins
to
write
it
there
the
latinist
and
sophister
and
every
unlearned
writer
tries
the
fitness
of
his
pen
a
practice
that
we
have
frequently
seen
injuring
the
usefulness
and
value
of
the
most
beautiful
books
again
there
is
a
class
of
thieves
shamefully
mutilating
books
who
cut
away
the
margins
from
the
sides
to
use
as
material
for
letters
leaving
only
the
text
or
employ
the
leaves
from
the
ends
inserted
for
the
protection
of
the
book
for
various
uses
and
abuses
a
kind
of
sacrilege
which
should
be
prohibited
by
the
threat
of
anathema
again
it
is
part
of
the
decency
of
scholars
that
whenever
they
return
from
meals
to
their
study
washing
should
invariably
precede
reading
and
that
no
finger
should
unfasten
the
clasps
or
turn
the
leaves
of
a
book
nor
let
a
crying
child
admire
the
pictures
in
the
capital
letters
lest
he
soil
the
parchment
with
wet
fingers
for
a
child
instantly
touches
whatever
he
sees
moreover
the
laity
who
look
at
a
book
turned
upside
down
just
as
if
it
were
open
in
the
right
way
are
utterly
unworthy
of
any
communion
with
books
let
the
clerk
take
care
also
that
the
smutty
scullion
reeking
from
his
stewpots
does
not
touch
the
lily
leaves
of
books
all
unwashed
but
he
who
walketh
without
blemish
shall
minister
to
the
precious
volumes
and
again
the
cleanliness
of
decent
hands
would
be
of
great
benefit
to
books
as
well
as
scholars
if
it
were
not
that
the
itch
and
pimples
are
characteristic
of
the
clergy
whenever
defects
are
noticed
in
books
they
should
be
promptly
repaired
since
nothing
spreads
more
quickly
than
a
tear
and
a
rent
which
is
neglected
at
the
time
will
have
to
be
repaired

the
gentlest
of

us
to
make
bookcases
most
neatly
wherein
they
may
be
protected

any
injury

this
book
of
the

it
in
the
side
of

for
a
library
which
was
made
of
imperishable
and
was
all
covered
within
and
without
with
gold
but
the
saviour
also
has
warned
us
by
his
example
against
all
unbecoming
carelessness
in
the
handling
of
books
as
we
read
in
luke
for
when
he
had
read
the
scriptural
prophecy
of
himself
in
the
book
that
was
delivered
to
him
he
did
not
give
it
again
to
the
minister
until
he
had
closed
it
with
his
own
most
sacred
hands
by
which
students
are
most
clearly
taught
that
in
the
care
of
books
the
merest
trifles
ought
not
to
be
neglected
chapter
xviii
showeth
that
we
have
collected
so
great
store
of
books
for
the
common
benefit
of
scholars
and
not
only
for
our
own
pleasure
nothing
in
human
affairs
is
more
unjust
than
that
those
things
which
are
most
righteously
done
should
be
perverted
by
the
slanders
of
malicious
men
and
that
one
should
bear
the
reproach
of
sin
where
he
has
rather
deserved
the
hope
of
honour
many
things
are
done
with
singleness
of
eye
the
right
hand
knoweth
not
what
the
left
hand
doth
the
lump
is
uncorrupted
by
leaven
nor
is
the
garment
woven
of
wool
and
linen
and
yet
by
the
trickery
of
perverse
men
a
pious
work
is
mendaciously
transformed
into
some
monstrous
act
certes
such
is
the
unhappy
condition
of
sinful
nature
that
not
merely
in
acts
that
are
morally
doubtful
it
adopts
the
worse
conclusion
but
often
it
depraves
by
iniquitous
subversion
those
which
have
the
appearance
of
rectitude
for
although
the
love
of
books
from
the
nature
of
its
object
bears
the
aspect
of
goodness
yet
wonderful
to
say
it
has
rendered
us
obnoxious
to
the
censures
of
many
by
whose
astonishment
we
were
disparaged
and
censured
now
for
excess
of
curiosity
now
for
the
exhibition
of
vanity
now
for
intemperance
of
delight
in
literature
though
indeed
we
were
no
more
disturbed
by
their
vituperation
than
by
the
barking
of
so
many
dogs
satisfied
with
the
testimony
of
him
to
whom
it
appertaineth
to
try
the
hearts
and
reins
for
as
the
aim
and
purpose
of
our
inmost
will
is
inscrutable
to
men
and
is
seen
of
god
alone
the
searcher
of
hearts
they
deserve
to
be
rebuked
for
their
pernicious
temerity
who
so
eagerly
set
a
mark
of
condemnation
upon
human
acts
the
ultimate
springs
of
which
they
can
not
see
for
the
final
end
in
matters
of
conduct
holds
the
same
position
as
first
principles
in
speculative
science
or
axioms
in
mathematics
as
the
chief
of
philosophers
aristotle
points
out
in
the
seventh
book
of
the
ethics
and
therefore
just
as
the
truth
of
our
conclusions
depends
upon
the
correctness
of
our
premises
so
in
matters
of
action
the
stamp
of
moral
rectitude
is
given
by
the
honesty
of
aim
and
purpose
in
cases
where
the
act
itself
would
otherwise
be
held
to
be
morally
indifferent
now
we
have
long
cherished
in
our
heart
of
hearts
the
fixed
resolve
when
providence
should
grant
a
favourable
opportunity
to
found
in
perpetual
charity
a
hall
in
the
reverend
university
of
oxford
the
chief
nursing
mother
of
all
liberal
arts
and
to
endow
it
with
the
necessary
revenues
for
the
maintenance
of
a
number
of
scholars
and
moreover
to
enrich
the
hall
with
the
treasures
of
our
books
that
all
and
every
of
them
should
be
in
common
as
regards
their
use
and
study
not
only
to
the
scholars
of
the
said
hall
but
by
their
means
to
all
the
students
of
the
university
for
ever
in
the
form
and
manner
which
the
following
chapter
shall
declare
wherefore
the
sincere
love
of
study
and
zeal
for
the
strengthening
of
the
orthodox
faith
to
the
edifying
of
the
church
have
begotten
in
us
that
solicitude
so
marvellous
to
the
lovers
of
pelf
of
collecting
books
wherever
they
were
to
be
purchased
regardless
of
expense
and
of
having
those
that
could
not
he
bought
fairly
transcribed
for
as
the
favourite
occupations
of
men
are
variously
distinguished
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
frequently
control
our
natural
composition
so
that
some
men
choose
to
devote
themselves
to
architecture
others
to
agriculture
others
to
hunting
others
to
navigation
others
to
war
others
to
games
we
have
under
the
aspect
of
mercury
entertained
a
blameless
pleasure
in
books
which
under
the
rule
of
right
reason
over
which
no
stars
are
dominant
we
have
ordered
to
the
glory
of
the
supreme
being
that
where
our
minds
found
tranquillity
and
peace
thence
also
might
spring
a
most
devout
service
of
god
and
therefore
let
our
detractors
cease
who
are
as
blind
men
judging
of
colours
let
not
bats
venture
to
speak
of
light
and
let
not
those
who
carry
beams
in
their
own
eyes
presume
to
pull
the
mote
out
of
their
brother
eye
let
them
cease
to
jeer
with
satirical
taunts
at
things
of
which
they
are
ignorant
and
to
discuss
hidden
things
that
are
not
revealed
to
the
eyes
of
men
who
perchance
would
have
praised
and
commended
us
if
we
had
spent
our
time
in
hunting
or
courting
the
smiles
of
ladies
chapter
xix
of
the
manner
of
lending
all
our
books
to
students
it
has
ever
been
difficult
so
to
restrain
men
by
the
laws
of
rectitude
that
the
astuteness
of
successors
might
not
strive
to
transgress
the
bounds
of
their
predecessors
and
to
infringe
established
rules
in
insolence
of
licence
accordingly
with
the
advice
of
prudent
men
we
have
prescribed
the
manner
in
which
we
desire
that
the
communication
and
use
of
our
books
should
be
permitted
for
the
benefit
of
students
imprimis
we
give
and
grant
all
and
singular
the
books
of
which
we
have
made
a
special
catalogue
in
consideration
of
affection
to
the
community
of
scholars
living
in
hall
at
oxford
as
a
perpetual
gift
for
our
soul
and
the
souls
of
our
parents
and
also
for
the
soul
of
the
most
illustrious
king
edward
the
third
from
the
conquest
and
of
the
most
pious
queen
philippa
his
consort
to
the
intent
that
the
same
books
may
be
lent
from
time
to
time
to
all
and
singular
the
scholars
and
masters
of
the
said
place
as
well
regular
as
secular
for
the
advancement
and
use
of
study
in
the
manner
immediately
following
that
is
to
say
five
of
the
scholars
sojourning
in
the
hall
aforesaid
shall
be
appointed
by
the
master
thereof
who
shall
have
the
charge
of
all
the
books
of
which
five
persons
three
and
not
fewer
may
lend
any
book
or
books
for
inspection
and
study
but
for
copying
or
transcribing
we
direct
that
no
book
shall
be
allowed
outside
the
walls
of
the
house
therefore
when
any
scholar
secular
or
religious
whom
for
this
purpose
we
regard
with
equal
favour
shall
seek
to
borrow
any
book
let
the
keepers
diligently
consider
if
they
have
a
duplicate
of
the
said
book
and
if
so
let
them
lend
him
the
book
taking
such
pledge
as
in
their
judgment
exceeds
the
value
of
the
book
delivered
and
let
a
record
be
made
forthwith
of
the
pledge
and
of
the
book
lent
containing
the
names
of
the
persons
delivering
the
book
and
of
the
person
who
receives
it
together
with
the
day
and
year
when
the
loan
is
made
but
if
the
keepers
find
that
the
book
asked
for
is
not
in
duplicate
they
shall
not
lend
such
book
to
any
one
whomsoever
unless
he
shall
belong
to
the
community
of
scholars
of
the
said
hall
unless
perhaps
for
inspection
within
the
walls
of
the
aforesaid
house
or
hall
but
not
to
be
carried
beyond
it
but
to
any
of
the
scholars
of
the
said
hall
any
book
may
be
lent
by
three
of
the
aforesaid
keepers
after
first
recording
however
his
name
with
the
day
on
which
he
receives
the
book
nevertheless
the
borrower
may
not
lend
the
book
entrusted
to
him
to
another
except
with
the
permission
of
three
of
the
aforesaid
keepers
and
then
the
name
of
the
first
borrower
being
erased
the
name
of
the
second
with
the
time
of
delivery
is
to
be
recorded
each
keeper
shall
take
an
oath
to
observe
all
these
regulations
when
they
enter
upon
the
charge
of
the
books
and
the
recipients
of
any
book
or
books
shall
thereupon
swear
that
they
will
not
use
the
book
or
books
for
any
other
purpose
but
that
of
inspection
or
study
and
that
they
will
not
take
or
permit
to
be
taken
it
or
them
beyond
the
town
and
suburbs
of
oxford
moreover
every
year
the
aforesaid
keepers
shall
render
an
account
to
the
master
of
the
house
and
two
of
his
scholars
whom
he
shall
associate
with
himself
or
if
he
shall
not
be
at
leisure
he
shall
appoint
three
inspectors
other
than
the
keepers
who
shall
peruse
the
catalogue
of
books
and
see
that
they
have
them
all
either
in
the
volumes
themselves
or
at
least
as
represented
by
deposits
and
the
more
fitting
season
for
rendering
this
account
we
believe
to
be
from
the
first
of
july
until
the
festival
of
the
translation
of
the
glorious
martyr
thomas
next
following
we
add
this
further
provision
that
anyone
to
whom
a
book
has
been
lent
shall
once
a
year
exhibit
it
to
the
keepers
and
shall
if
he
wishes
it
see
his
pledge
moreover
if
it
chances
that
a
book
is
lost
by
death
theft
fraud
or
carelessness
he
who
has
lost
it
or
his
representative
or
executor
shall
pay
the
value
of
the
book
and
receive
back
his
deposit
but
if
in
any
wise
any
profit
shall
accrue
to
the
keepers
it
shall
not
be
applied
to
any
purpose
but
the
repair
and
maintenance
of
the
books
chapter
xx
an
exhortation
to
scholars
to
requite
us
by
pious
prayers
time
now
clamours
for
us
to
terminate
this
treatise
which
we
have
composed
concerning
the
love
of
books
in
which
we
have
endeavoured
to
give
the
astonishment
of
our
contemporaries
the
reason
why
we
have
loved
books
so
greatly
but
because
it
is
hardly
granted
to
mortals
to
accomplish
aught
that
is
not
rolled
in
the
dust
of
vanity
we
do
not
venture
entirely
to
justify
the
zealous
love
which
we
have
so
long
had
for
books
or
to
deny
that
it
may
perchance
sometimes
have
been
the
occasion
of
some
venial
negligence
albeit
the
object
of
our
love
is
honourable
and
our
intention
upright
for
if
when
we
have
done
everything
we
are
bound
to
call
ourselves
unprofitable
servants
if
the
most
holy
job
was
afraid
of
all
his
works
if
according
to
isaiah
all
our
righteousness
is
as
filthy
rags
who
shall
presume
to
boast
himself
of
the
perfection
of
any
virtue
or
deny
that
from
some
circumstance
a
thing
may
deserve
to
be
reprehended
which
in
itself
perhaps
was
not
reprehensible
for
good
springs
from
one
selfsame
source
but
evil
arises
in
many
ways
as
dionysius
informs
us
wherefore
to
make
amends
for
our
iniquities
by
which
we
acknowledge
ourselves
to
have
frequently
offended
the
creator
of
all
things
in
asking
the
assistance
of
their
prayers
we
have
thought
fit
to
exhort
our
future
students
to
show
their
gratitude
as
well
to
us
as
to
their
other
benefactors
in
time
to
come
by
requiting
our
forethought
for
their
benefit
by
spiritual
retribution
let
us
live
when
dead
in
their
memories
who
have
lived
in
our
benevolence
before
they
were
born
and
live
now
sustained
by
our
beneficence
let
them
implore
the
mercy
of
the
redeemer
with
unwearied
prayer
that
the
pious
judge
may
excuse
our
negligences
may
pardon
the
wickedness
of
our
sins
may
cover
the
lapses
of
our
feebleness
with
the
cloak
of
piety
and
remit
by
his
divine
goodness
the
offences
of
which
we
are
ashamed
and
penitent
that
he
may
preserve
to
us
for
a
due
season
of
repentance
the
gifts
of
his
good
grace
steadfastness
of
faith
loftiness
of
hope
and
the
widest
charity
to
all
men
that
he
may
turn
our
haughty
will
to
lament
its
faults
that
it
may
deplore
its
past
most
vain
elations
may
retract
its
most
bitter
indignations
and
detest
its
most
insane
delectations
that
his
virtue
may
abound
in
us
when
our
own
is
found
wanting
and
that
he
who
freely
consecrated
our
beginning
by
the
sacrament
of
baptism
and
advanced
our
progress
to
the
seat
of
the
apostles
without
any
desert
of
ours
may
deign
to
fortify
our
outgoing
by
the
fitting
sacraments
that
we
may
be
delivered
from
the
lust
of
the
flesh
that
the
fear
of
death
may
utterly
vanish
and
our
spirit
may
desire
to
be
dissolved
and
be
with
christ
and
existing
upon
earth
in
body
only
in
thought
and
longing
our
conversation
may
be
in
heaven
that
the
father
of
mercies
and
the
god
of
all
consolation
may
graciously
come
to
meet
the
prodigal
returning
from
the
husks
that
he
may
receive
the
piece
of
silver
that
has
been
lately
found
and
transmit
it
by
his
holy
angels
into
his
eternal
treasury
that
he
may
rebuke
with
his
terrible
countenance
at
the
hour
of
our
departure
the
spirits
of
darkness
lest
leviathan
that
old
serpent
lying
hid
at
the
gate
of
death
should
spread
unforeseen
snares
for
our
feet
but
when
we
shall
be
summoned
to
the
awful
to
give
an
account
on
the
testimony
of
conscience
of
all
things
we
have
done
in
the
body
the
may
consider
the
price
of
the
holy
blood
that
he
has
shed
and
that
the
incarnate
deity
may
note
the
frame
of
our
carnal
nature
that
our
weakness
may
pass
unpunished
where
infinite
is
to
be
found
and
that
the
soul
of
the
wretched
sinner
may
breathe
again
where
the
peculiar
office
of
the
judge
is
to
show
mercy
and
further
let
our
students
be
always
diligent
in
invoking
the
refuge
of
our
hope
after
god
the
virgin
mother
of
god
and
blessed
queen
of
heaven
that
we
who
for
our
manifold
sins
and
wickednesses
have
deserved
the
anger
of
the
judge
by
the
aid
of
her
supplications
may
merit
his
forgiveness
that
her
pious
hand
may
depress
the
scale
of
the
balance
in
which
our
small
and
few
good
deeds
shall
be
weighed
lest
the
heaviness
of
our
sins
preponderate
and
cast
us
down
to
the
bottomless
pit
of
perdition
moreover
let
them
ever
venerate
with
due
observance
the
most
deserving
confessor
cuthbert
the
care
of
whose
flock
we
have
unworthily
undertaken
ever
devoutly
praying
that
he
may
deign
to
excuse
by
his
prayers
his
vicar
and
may
procure
him
whom
he
hath
admitted
as
his
successor
upon
earth
to
be
made
his
assessor
in
heaven
finally
let
them
pray
god
with
holy
prayers
as
well
of
body
as
of
soul
that
he
will
restore
the
spirit
created
in
the
image
of
the
trinity
after
its
sojourn
in
this
miserable
world
to
its
primordial
prototype
and
grant
to
it
for
ever
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
his
countenance
through
our
lord
jesus
