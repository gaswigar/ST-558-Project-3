my
god
he
cried
introduction
of
murders
and
mysteries
as
this
little
book
was
written
some
four
years
ago
i
feel
able
to
review
it
without
prejudice
a
new
book
just
hot
from
the
brain
is
naturally
apt
to
appear
faulty
to
its
begetter
but
an
old
book
has
got
into
the
proper
perspective
and
may
be
praised
by
him
without
fear
or
favor
the
big
bow
mystery
seems
to
me
an
excellent
murder
story
as
murder
stories
go
for
while
as
sensational
as
the
most
of
them
it
contains
more
humor
and
character
creation
than
the
best
indeed
the
humor
is
too
abundant
mysteries
should
be
sedate
and
sober
there
should
be
a
pervasive
atmosphere
of
horror
and
awe
such
as
poe
manages
to
create
humor
is
out
of
tone
it
would
be
more
artistic
to
preserve
a
somber
note
throughout
but
i
was
a
realist
in
those
days
and
in
real
life
mysteries
occur
to
real
persons
with
their
individual
humors
and
mysterious
circumstances
are
apt
to
be
complicated
by
comic
the
indispensable
condition
of
a
good
mystery
is
that
it
should
be
able
and
unable
to
be
solved
by
the
reader
and
that
the
writer
solution
should
satisfy
many
a
mystery
runs
on
breathlessly
enough
till
the
d√©nouement
is
reached
only
to
leave
the
reader
with
the
sense
of
having
been
robbed
of
his
breath
under
false
pretenses
and
not
only
must
the
solution
be
adequate
but
all
its
data
must
be
given
in
the
body
of
the
story
the
author
must
not
suddenly
spring
a
new
person
or
a
new
circumstance
upon
his
reader
at
the
end
thus
if
a
friend
were
to
ask
me
to
guess
who
dined
with
him
yesterday
it
would
be
fatuous
if
he
had
in
mind
somebody
of
whom
he
knew
i
had
never
heard
the
only
person
who
has
ever
solved
the
big
bow
mystery
is
myself
this
is
not
paradox
but
plain
fact
for
long
before
the
book
was
written
i
said
to
myself
one
night
that
no
had
ever
murdered
a
man
in
a
room
to
which
there
was
no
possible
access
the
puzzle
was
scarcely
propounded
ere
the
solution
flew
up
and
the
idea
lay
stored
in
my
mind
till
years
later
during
the
silly
season
the
editor
of
a
popular
london
evening
paper
anxious
to
let
the
have
a
year
off
asked
me
to
provide
him
with
a
more
original
piece
of
fiction
i
might
have
refused
but
there
was
murder
in
my
soul
and
here
was
the
opportunity
i
went
to
work
seriously
though
the
subsequently
said
the
skit
was
too
labored
and
i
succeeded
at
least
in
exciting
my
readers
so
many
of
whom
sent
in
unsolicited
testimonials
in
the
shape
of
solutions
during
the
run
of
the
story
that
when
it
ended
the
editor
asked
me
to
say
something
by
way
of
acknowledgement
thereupon
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
paper
thanking
the
solvers
for
their
kindly
attempts
to
help
me
out
of
the
mess
into
which
i
had
got
the
plot
i
did
not
like
to
wound
their
feelings
by
saying
straight
out
that
they
had
failed
one
and
all
to
hit
on
the
real
murderer
just
like
real
police
so
i
tried
to
break
the
truth
to
them
in
a
roundabout
mendacious
fashion
as
thus
the
editor
of
the
star
sir
now
that
the
big
bow
mystery
is
solved
to
the
satisfaction
of
at
least
one
person
will
you
allow
that
person
the
use
of
your
invaluable
columns
to
enable
him
to
thank
the
hundreds
of
your
readers
who
have
favored
him
with
their
kind
suggestions
and
solutions
while
his
tale
was
running
and
they
were
reading
i
ask
this
more
especially
because
great
credit
is
due
to
them
for
enabling
me
to
end
the
story
in
a
manner
so
satisfactory
to
myself
when
i
started
it
i
had
of
course
no
idea
who
had
done
the
murder
but
i
was
determined
no
one
should
guess
it
accordingly
as
each
correspondent
sent
in
the
name
of
a
suspect
i
determined
he
or
she
should
not
be
the
guilty
party
by
degrees
every
one
of
the
characters
got
ticked
off
as
innocent
all
except
one
and
i
had
no
option
but
to
make
that
character
the
murderer
i
was
very
sorry
to
do
this
as
i
rather
liked
that
particular
person
but
when
one
has
such
ingenious
readers
what
can
one
do
you
ca
let
anybody
boast
that
he
guessed
aright
and
in
spite
of
the
trouble
of
altering
the
plot
five
or
six
times
i
feel
that
i
have
chosen
the
course
most
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
my
profession
had
i
not
been
impelled
by
this
consideration
i
should
certainly
have
brought
in
a
verdict
against
drabdump
as
recommended
by
the
reader
who
said
that
judging
by
the
illustration
in
the
star
she
must
be
at
least
seven
feet
high
and
therefore
could
easily
have
got
on
the
roof
and
put
her
proportionately
long
arm
down
the
chimney
to
effect
the
cut
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
artist
conception
of
the
character
when
i
last
saw
the
good
lady
she
was
under
six
feet
but
your
artist
may
have
had
later
information
the
star
is
always
so
frightfully
up
to
date
i
ought
not
to
omit
the
humorous
remark
of
a
correspondent
who
said
mortlake
might
have
swung
in
some
wild
way
from
one
window
to
another
any
rate
in
a
i
hope
my
thus
satirically
prodded
will
not
demand
his
name
as
i
object
to
murders
at
any
rate
in
real
life
finally
a
word
with
the
legions
who
have
taken
me
to
task
for
allowing
gladstone
to
write
over
words
on
a
postcard
it
is
all
owing
to
you
sir
who
announced
my
story
as
containing
humorous
elements
i
tried
to
put
in
some
and
this
gentle
dig
at
the
grand
old
habits
was
intended
to
be
one
of
them
however
if
i
to
be
taken
at
the
foot
of
the
letter
or
rather
of
the
postcard
i
must
say
that
only
i
received
a
postcard
containing
about
words
but
this
was
not
from
gladstone
at
any
rate
till
gladstone
himself
repudiates
this
postcard
i
shall
consider
myself
justified
in
allowing
it
to
stand
in
the
book
again
thanking
your
readers
for
their
valuable
assistance
yours
etc
one
would
have
imagined
that
nobody
could
take
this
seriously
for
it
is
obvious
that
the
is
just
the
one
species
of
story
that
can
not
be
told
impromptu
or
altered
at
the
last
moment
seeing
that
it
demands
the
most
careful
piecing
together
and
the
most
elaborate
nevertheless
if
you
cast
your
joke
upon
the
waters
you
shall
find
it
no
joke
after
many
days
this
is
what
i
read
in
the
new
zealand
the
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
seems
fairly
irrefragable
from
all
accounts
zangwill
himself
was
puzzled
after
carefully
forging
every
link
how
to
break
it
the
method
ultimately
adopted
i
consider
more
ingenious
than
convincing
after
that
i
made
up
my
mind
never
to
joke
again
but
this
good
intention
now
helps
to
pave
the
beaten
path
zangwill
london
september
note
the
mystery
which
the
author
will
always
associate
with
this
story
is
how
he
got
through
the
task
of
writing
it
it
was
written
in
a
fortnight
day
by
day
to
meet
a
sudden
demand
from
the
star
which
made
a
new
departure
with
it
the
said
fortnight
was
further
disturbed
by
an
extraordinary
combined
attack
of
other
troubles
and
tasks
this
is
no
excuse
for
the
shortcomings
of
the
book
as
it
was
always
open
to
the
writer
to
revise
or
suppress
it
the
latter
function
may
safely
be
left
to
the
public
while
if
the
work
stands
almost
to
a
letter
as
it
appeared
in
the
star
it
is
because
the
author
can
not
tell
a
story
more
than
once
the
introduction
of
gladstone
into
a
fictitious
scene
is
defended
on
the
ground
that
he
is
largely
mythical
i
z
the
big
bow
mystery
chapter
i
on
a
memorable
morning
of
early
december
london
opened
its
eyes
on
a
frigid
gray
mist
there
are
mornings
when
king
fog
masses
his
molecules
of
carbon
in
serried
squadrons
in
the
city
while
he
scatters
them
tenuously
in
the
suburbs
so
that
your
morning
train
may
bear
you
from
twilight
to
darkness
but
the
enemy
maneuvering
was
more
monotonous
from
bow
even
unto
hammersmith
there
draggled
a
dull
wretched
vapor
like
the
wraith
of
an
impecunious
suicide
come
into
a
fortune
immediately
after
the
fatal
deed
the
barometers
and
thermometers
had
sympathetically
shared
its
depression
and
their
spirits
when
they
had
any
were
low
the
cold
cut
like
a
knife
drabdump
of
glover
street
bow
was
one
of
the
few
persons
in
london
whom
fog
did
not
depress
she
went
about
her
work
quite
as
cheerlessly
as
usual
she
had
been
among
the
earliest
to
be
aware
of
the
enemy
advent
picking
out
the
strands
of
fog
from
the
coils
of
darkness
the
moment
she
rolled
up
her
bedroom
blind
and
unveiled
the
somber
picture
of
the
winter
morning
she
knew
that
the
fog
had
come
to
stay
for
the
day
at
least
and
that
the
gas
bill
for
the
quarter
was
going
to
beat
the
record
in
she
also
knew
that
this
was
because
she
had
allowed
her
new
gentleman
lodger
arthur
constant
to
pay
a
fixed
sum
of
a
shilling
a
week
for
gas
instead
of
charging
him
a
proportion
of
the
actual
account
for
the
whole
house
the
meteorologists
might
have
saved
the
credit
of
their
science
if
they
had
reckoned
with
drabdump
next
gas
bill
when
they
predicted
the
weather
and
made
snow
the
favorite
and
said
that
fog
would
be
nowhere
fog
was
everywhere
yet
drabdump
took
no
credit
to
herself
for
her
prescience
drabdump
indeed
took
no
credit
for
anything
paying
her
way
along
doggedly
and
struggling
through
life
like
a
wearied
swimmer
trying
to
touch
the
horizon
that
things
always
went
as
badly
as
she
had
foreseen
did
not
exhilarate
her
in
the
least
drabdump
was
a
widow
widows
are
not
born
but
made
else
you
might
have
fancied
drabdump
had
always
been
a
widow
nature
had
given
her
that
tall
spare
form
and
that
pale
elongated
visage
and
that
painfully
precise
hair
which
are
always
associated
with
widowhood
in
low
life
it
is
only
in
higher
circles
that
women
can
lose
their
husbands
and
yet
remain
bewitching
the
late
drabdump
had
scratched
the
base
of
his
thumb
with
a
rusty
nail
and
foreboding
that
he
would
die
of
lockjaw
had
not
prevented
her
wrestling
day
and
night
with
the
shadow
of
death
as
she
had
wrestled
with
it
vainly
twice
before
when
katie
died
of
diphtheria
and
little
johnny
of
scarlet
fever
perhaps
it
is
from
overwork
among
the
poor
that
death
has
been
reduced
to
a
shadow
drabdump
was
lighting
the
kitchen
fire
she
did
it
very
scientifically
as
knowing
the
contrariety
of
coal
and
the
anxiety
of
flaming
sticks
to
end
in
smoke
unless
rigidly
kept
up
to
the
mark
science
was
a
success
as
usual
and
drabdump
rose
from
her
knees
content
like
a
parsee
priestess
who
had
duly
paid
her
morning
devotions
to
her
deity
then
she
started
violently
and
nearly
lost
her
balance
her
eye
had
caught
the
hands
of
the
clock
on
the
mantel
they
pointed
to
fifteen
minutes
to
seven
drabdump
devotion
to
the
kitchen
fire
invariably
terminated
at
fifteen
minutes
past
six
what
was
the
matter
with
the
clock
drabdump
had
an
immediate
vision
of
snoppet
the
neighboring
horologist
keeping
the
clock
in
hand
for
weeks
and
then
returning
it
only
superficially
repaired
and
secretly
injured
more
vitally
for
the
good
of
the
trade
the
evil
vision
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
came
exorcised
by
the
deep
boom
of
dunstan
bells
chiming
the
in
its
place
a
great
horror
surged
instinct
had
failed
drabdump
had
risen
at
six
instead
of
six
now
she
understood
why
she
had
been
feeling
so
dazed
and
strange
and
sleepy
she
had
overslept
herself
chagrined
and
puzzled
she
hastily
set
the
kettle
over
the
crackling
coal
discovering
a
second
later
that
she
had
overslept
herself
because
mr
constant
wished
to
be
woke
of
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
and
to
have
his
breakfast
at
seven
having
to
speak
at
an
early
meeting
of
discontented
she
ran
at
once
candle
in
hand
to
his
bedroom
it
was
upstairs
all
upstairs
was
arthur
domain
for
it
consisted
of
but
two
mutually
independent
rooms
drabdump
knocked
viciously
at
the
door
of
the
one
he
used
for
a
bedroom
crying
seven
sir
you
be
late
sir
you
must
get
up
at
once
the
usual
slumbrous
all
right
was
not
forthcoming
but
as
she
herself
had
varied
her
morning
salute
her
ear
was
less
expectant
of
the
echo
she
went
downstairs
with
no
foreboding
save
that
the
kettle
would
come
off
second
best
in
the
race
between
its
boiling
and
her
dressing
for
she
knew
there
was
no
fear
of
arthur
constant
lying
deaf
to
the
call
of
duty
temporarily
represented
by
drabdump
he
was
a
light
sleeper
and
the
tram
conductors
bells
were
probably
ringing
in
his
ears
summoning
him
to
the
meeting
why
arthur
constant
b
and
and
gentleman
to
the
very
purse
of
him
should
concern
himself
with
when
fortune
had
confined
his
necessary
relations
with
drivers
to
cabmen
at
the
least
drabdump
could
not
quite
make
out
he
probably
aspired
to
represent
bow
in
parliament
but
then
it
would
surely
have
been
wiser
to
lodge
with
a
landlady
who
possessed
a
vote
by
having
a
husband
alive
nor
was
there
much
practical
wisdom
in
his
wish
to
black
his
own
boots
an
occupation
in
which
he
shone
but
little
and
to
live
in
every
way
like
a
bow
working
man
bow
working
men
were
not
so
lavish
in
their
patronage
of
water
whether
existing
in
drinking
glasses
morning
tubs
or
establishments
nor
did
they
eat
the
delicacies
with
which
drabdump
supplied
him
with
the
assurance
that
they
were
the
artisan
appanage
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
eat
things
unbefitting
his
station
arthur
constant
opened
his
mouth
and
ate
what
his
landlady
gave
him
not
first
deliberately
shutting
his
eyes
according
to
the
formula
the
rather
pluming
himself
on
keeping
them
very
wide
open
but
it
is
difficult
for
saints
to
see
through
their
own
halos
and
in
practice
an
aureola
about
the
head
is
often
indistinguishable
from
a
mist
the
tea
to
be
scalded
in
mr
constant
pot
when
that
cantankerous
kettle
should
boil
was
not
the
coarse
mixture
of
black
and
green
sacred
to
herself
and
mortlake
of
whom
the
thoughts
of
breakfast
now
reminded
her
poor
mortlake
gone
off
without
any
to
devonport
somewhere
about
four
in
the
darkness
of
a
winter
night
well
she
hoped
his
journey
would
be
duly
rewarded
that
his
perks
would
be
heavy
and
that
he
would
make
as
good
a
thing
out
of
the
traveling
expenses
as
rival
labor
leaders
roundly
accused
him
of
to
other
people
faces
she
did
not
grudge
him
his
gains
nor
was
it
her
business
if
as
they
alleged
in
introducing
mr
constant
to
her
vacant
rooms
his
idea
was
not
merely
to
benefit
his
landlady
he
had
done
her
an
uncommon
good
turn
queer
as
was
the
lodger
thus
introduced
his
own
apostleship
to
the
sons
of
toil
gave
drabdump
no
twinges
of
perplexity
tom
mortlake
had
been
a
compositor
and
apostleship
was
obviously
a
profession
better
paid
and
of
a
higher
social
status
tom
mortlake
the
hero
of
a
hundred
strikes
set
up
in
print
on
a
poster
was
unmistakably
superior
to
tom
mortlake
setting
up
other
men
names
at
a
case
still
the
work
was
not
all
beer
and
skittles
and
drabdump
felt
that
tom
latest
job
was
not
enviable
she
shook
his
door
as
she
passed
it
on
her
way
to
the
kitchen
but
there
was
no
response
the
street
door
was
only
a
few
feet
off
down
the
passage
and
a
glance
at
it
dispelled
the
last
hope
that
tom
had
abandoned
the
journey
the
door
was
unbolted
and
unchained
and
the
only
security
was
the
lock
drabdump
felt
a
whit
uneasy
though
to
give
her
her
due
she
never
suffered
as
much
as
most
housewives
do
from
criminals
who
never
come
not
quite
opposite
but
still
only
a
few
doors
off
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
lived
the
celebrated
grodman
and
illogically
enough
his
presence
in
the
street
gave
drabdump
a
curious
sense
of
security
as
of
a
believer
living
under
the
shadow
of
the
fane
that
any
human
being
of
should
consciously
come
within
a
mile
of
the
scent
of
so
famous
a
seemed
to
her
highly
improbable
grodman
had
retired
with
a
competence
and
was
only
a
sleeping
dog
now
still
even
criminals
would
have
sense
enough
to
let
him
lie
so
drabdump
did
not
really
feel
that
there
had
been
any
danger
especially
as
a
second
glance
at
the
street
door
showed
that
mortlake
had
been
thoughtful
enough
to
slip
the
loop
that
held
back
the
bolt
of
the
big
lock
she
allowed
herself
another
throb
of
sympathy
for
the
labor
leader
whirling
on
his
dreary
way
toward
devonport
dockyard
not
that
he
had
told
her
anything
of
his
journey
beyond
the
town
but
she
knew
devonport
had
a
dockyard
because
jessie
dymond
sweetheart
once
mentioned
that
her
aunt
lived
near
there
and
it
lay
on
the
surface
that
tom
had
gone
to
help
the
dockers
who
were
imitating
their
london
brethren
drabdump
did
not
need
to
be
told
things
to
be
aware
of
them
she
went
back
to
prepare
mr
constant
superfine
tea
vaguely
wondering
why
people
were
so
discontented
nowadays
but
when
she
brought
up
the
tea
and
the
toast
and
the
eggs
to
mr
which
adjoined
his
bedroom
though
without
communicating
with
it
mr
constant
was
not
sitting
in
it
she
lit
the
gas
and
laid
the
cloth
then
she
returned
to
the
landing
and
beat
at
the
bedroom
door
with
an
imperative
palm
silence
alone
answered
her
she
called
him
by
name
and
told
him
the
hour
but
hers
was
the
only
voice
she
heard
and
it
sounded
strangely
to
her
in
the
shadows
of
the
staircase
then
muttering
poor
gentleman
he
had
the
toothache
last
night
and
he
only
just
got
a
wink
o
sleep
pity
to
disturb
him
for
the
sake
of
them
grizzling
conductors
i
let
him
sleep
his
usual
time
she
bore
the
downstairs
with
a
mournful
almost
poetic
consciousness
that
eggs
like
love
must
grow
cold
seven
came
and
she
knocked
again
but
constant
slept
on
his
letters
always
a
strange
assortment
arrived
at
eight
and
a
telegram
came
soon
after
drabdump
rattled
his
door
shouted
and
at
last
put
the
wire
under
it
her
heart
was
beating
fast
enough
now
though
there
seemed
to
be
a
cold
clammy
snake
curling
round
it
she
went
downstairs
again
and
turned
the
handle
of
mortlake
room
and
went
in
without
knowing
why
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
showed
that
the
occupant
had
only
lain
down
in
his
clothes
as
if
fearing
to
miss
the
early
train
she
had
not
for
a
moment
expected
to
find
him
in
the
room
yet
somehow
the
consciousness
that
she
was
alone
in
the
house
with
the
sleeping
constant
seemed
to
flash
for
the
first
time
upon
her
and
the
clammy
snake
tightened
its
folds
round
her
heart
she
opened
the
street
door
and
her
eye
wandered
nervously
up
and
down
it
was
eight
the
little
street
stretched
cold
and
still
in
the
gray
mist
blinking
bleary
eyes
at
either
end
where
the
street
lamps
smoldered
on
no
one
was
visible
for
the
moment
though
smoke
was
rising
from
many
of
the
chimneys
to
greet
its
sister
mist
at
the
house
of
the
detective
across
the
way
the
blinds
were
still
down
and
the
shutters
up
yet
the
familiar
prosaic
aspect
of
the
street
calmed
her
the
bleak
air
set
her
coughing
she
slammed
the
door
to
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
make
fresh
tea
for
constant
who
could
only
be
in
a
deep
sleep
but
the
canister
trembled
in
her
grasp
she
did
not
know
whether
she
dropped
it
or
threw
it
down
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
hand
that
battered
again
a
moment
later
at
the
bedroom
door
no
sound
within
answered
the
clamor
without
she
rained
blow
upon
blow
in
a
sort
of
spasm
of
frenzy
scarce
remembering
that
her
object
was
merely
to
wake
her
lodger
and
almost
staving
in
the
lower
panels
with
her
kicks
then
she
turned
the
handle
and
tried
to
open
the
door
but
it
was
locked
the
resistance
recalled
her
to
herself
she
had
a
moment
of
shocked
decency
at
the
thought
that
she
had
been
about
to
enter
constant
bedroom
then
the
terror
came
over
her
afresh
she
felt
that
she
was
alone
in
the
house
with
a
corpse
she
sank
to
the
floor
cowering
with
difficulty
stifling
a
desire
to
scream
then
she
rose
with
a
jerk
and
raced
down
the
stairs
without
looking
behind
her
and
threw
open
the
door
and
ran
out
into
the
street
only
pulling
up
with
her
hand
violently
agitating
grodman
in
a
moment
the
first
floor
window
was
raised
the
little
house
was
of
the
same
pattern
as
her
own
and
grodman
full
fleshy
face
loomed
through
the
fog
in
sleepy
irritation
from
under
a
nightcap
despite
its
scowl
the
face
dawned
upon
her
like
the
sun
upon
an
occupant
of
the
haunted
chamber
what
in
the
devil
the
matter
he
growled
grodman
was
not
an
early
bird
now
that
he
had
no
worms
to
catch
he
could
afford
to
despise
proverbs
now
for
the
house
in
which
he
lived
was
his
and
he
lived
in
it
because
several
other
houses
in
the
street
were
also
his
and
it
is
well
for
the
landlord
to
be
about
his
own
estate
in
bow
where
poachers
often
shoot
the
moon
perhaps
the
desire
to
enjoy
his
greatness
among
his
early
cronies
counted
for
something
too
for
he
had
been
born
and
bred
at
bow
receiving
when
a
youth
his
first
engagement
from
the
local
police
quarters
whence
he
drew
a
few
shillings
a
week
as
an
amateur
detective
in
his
leisure
hours
grodman
was
still
a
bachelor
in
the
celestial
matrimonial
bureau
a
partner
might
have
been
selected
for
him
but
he
had
never
been
able
to
discover
her
it
was
his
one
failure
as
a
detective
he
was
a
person
who
preferred
a
gas
stove
to
a
domestic
but
in
deference
to
glover
street
opinion
he
admitted
a
female
factotum
between
ten
and
ten
and
equally
in
deference
to
glover
street
opinion
excluded
her
between
ten
and
ten
i
want
you
to
come
across
at
once
drabdump
gasped
something
has
happened
to
mr
constant
what
not
bludgeoned
by
the
police
at
the
meeting
this
morning
i
hope
no
no
he
did
go
he
is
dead
dead
grodman
face
grew
very
serious
now
yes
murdered
what
almost
shouted
the
how
when
where
who
i
do
know
i
ca
get
to
him
i
have
beaten
at
his
door
he
does
not
answer
grodman
face
lit
up
with
relief
you
silly
woman
is
that
all
i
shall
have
a
cold
in
my
head
bitter
weather
he
after
yesterday
processions
three
speeches
kindergarten
lecture
on
moon
article
on
that
his
style
it
was
also
grodman
style
he
never
wasted
words
no
drabdump
breathed
up
at
him
solemnly
he
dead
all
right
go
back
do
alarm
the
neighborhood
unnecessarily
wait
for
me
down
in
five
minutes
grodman
did
not
take
this
cassandra
of
the
kitchen
too
seriously
probably
he
knew
his
woman
his
small
eyes
glittered
with
an
almost
amused
smile
as
he
withdrew
them
from
drabdump
ken
and
shut
down
the
sash
with
a
bang
the
poor
woman
ran
back
across
the
road
and
through
her
door
which
she
would
not
close
behind
her
it
seemed
to
shut
her
in
with
the
dead
she
waited
in
the
passage
after
an
age
seven
minutes
by
any
honest
clock
grodman
made
his
appearance
looking
as
dressed
as
usual
but
with
unkempt
hair
and
with
disconsolate
he
was
not
quite
used
to
that
yet
for
it
had
only
recently
come
within
the
margin
of
cultivation
in
active
service
grodman
had
been
like
all
members
of
the
profession
for
surely
your
detective
is
the
most
versatile
of
actors
drabdump
closed
the
street
door
quietly
and
pointed
to
the
stairs
fear
operating
like
a
polite
desire
to
give
him
precedence
grodman
ascended
amusement
still
glimmering
in
his
eyes
arrived
on
the
landing
he
knocked
peremptorily
at
the
door
crying
nine
mr
constant
nine
when
he
ceased
there
was
no
other
sound
or
movement
his
face
grew
more
serious
he
waited
then
knocked
and
cried
louder
he
turned
the
handle
but
the
door
was
fast
he
tried
to
peer
through
the
keyhole
but
it
was
blocked
he
shook
the
upper
panels
but
the
door
seemed
bolted
as
well
as
locked
he
stood
still
his
face
set
and
rigid
for
he
liked
and
esteemed
the
man
ay
knock
your
loudest
whispered
the
woman
you
not
wake
him
now
the
gray
mist
had
followed
them
through
the
street
door
and
hovered
about
the
staircase
charging
the
air
with
a
moist
sepulchral
odor
locked
and
bolted
muttered
grodman
shaking
the
door
afresh
burst
it
open
breathed
the
woman
trembling
violently
all
over
and
holding
her
hands
before
her
as
if
to
ward
off
the
dreadful
vision
without
another
word
grodman
applied
his
shoulder
to
the
door
and
made
a
violent
muscular
effort
he
had
been
an
athlete
in
his
time
and
the
sap
was
yet
in
him
the
door
creaked
little
by
little
it
began
to
give
the
woodwork
enclosing
the
bolt
of
the
lock
splintered
the
panels
bent
upward
the
large
upper
bolt
tore
off
its
iron
staple
the
door
flew
back
with
a
crash
grodman
rushed
in
my
god
he
cried
the
woman
shrieked
the
sight
was
too
terrible
within
a
few
hours
the
jubilant
were
shrieking
horrible
suicide
in
bow
and
the
star
poster
added
for
the
satisfaction
of
those
too
poor
to
purchase
a
philanthropist
cuts
his
throat
chapter
ii
but
the
newspapers
were
premature
scotland
yard
refused
to
prejudge
the
case
despite
the
several
arrests
were
made
so
that
the
later
editions
were
compelled
to
soften
suicide
into
mystery
the
people
arrested
were
a
nondescript
collection
of
tramps
most
of
them
had
committed
other
offenses
for
which
the
police
had
not
arrested
them
one
gentleman
gave
himself
up
as
if
he
were
a
riddle
but
the
police
would
have
none
of
him
and
restored
him
forthwith
to
his
friends
and
keepers
the
number
of
candidates
for
each
new
opening
in
newgate
is
astonishing
the
full
significance
of
this
tragedy
of
a
noble
young
life
cut
short
had
hardly
time
to
filter
into
the
public
mind
when
a
fresh
sensation
absorbed
it
tom
mortlake
had
been
arrested
the
same
day
at
liverpool
on
suspicion
of
being
concerned
in
the
death
of
his
the
news
fell
like
a
bombshell
upon
a
land
in
which
tom
mortlake
name
was
a
household
word
that
the
gifted
artisan
orator
who
had
never
shrunk
upon
occasion
from
launching
red
rhetoric
at
society
should
actually
have
shed
blood
seemed
too
startling
especially
as
the
blood
shed
was
not
blue
but
the
property
of
a
lovable
young
idealist
who
had
now
literally
given
his
life
to
the
cause
but
this
supplementary
sensation
did
not
grow
to
a
head
and
everybody
save
a
few
labor
leaders
was
relieved
to
hear
that
tom
had
been
released
almost
immediately
being
merely
subpoenaed
to
appear
at
the
inquest
in
an
interview
which
he
accorded
to
the
representative
of
a
liverpool
paper
the
same
afternoon
he
stated
that
he
put
his
arrest
down
entirely
to
the
enmity
and
rancor
entertained
toward
him
by
the
police
throughout
the
country
he
had
come
to
liverpool
to
trace
the
movements
of
a
friend
about
whom
he
was
very
uneasy
and
he
was
making
anxious
inquiries
at
the
docks
to
discover
at
what
times
steamers
left
for
america
when
the
detectives
stationed
there
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
headquarters
had
arrested
him
as
a
character
though
said
tom
they
must
very
well
have
known
my
phiz
as
i
have
been
sketched
and
caricatured
all
over
the
shop
when
i
told
them
who
i
was
they
had
the
decency
to
let
me
go
they
thought
they
scored
off
me
enough
i
reckon
yes
it
certainly
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
i
might
actually
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
poor
fellow
death
which
has
cut
me
up
as
much
as
anybody
though
if
they
had
known
i
had
just
come
from
the
of
the
crime
and
actually
lived
in
the
house
they
would
probably
have
let
me
alone
he
laughed
sarcastically
they
are
a
queer
lot
of
are
the
police
their
motto
is
catch
your
man
then
cook
the
evidence
if
you
on
the
spot
you
guilty
because
you
there
and
if
elsewhere
you
guilty
because
you
have
gone
away
oh
i
know
them
if
they
could
have
seen
their
way
to
clap
me
in
quod
they
ha
done
it
lucky
i
know
the
number
of
the
cabman
who
took
me
to
euston
before
five
this
morning
if
they
clapped
you
in
quod
the
interviewer
reported
himself
as
facetiously
observing
the
prisoners
would
be
on
strike
in
a
week
yes
but
there
would
be
so
many
ready
to
take
their
places
mortlake
flashed
back
that
i
afraid
it
be
no
go
but
do
excuse
me
i
am
so
upset
about
my
friend
i
afraid
he
has
left
england
and
i
have
to
make
inquiries
and
now
there
poor
constant
gone
horrible
horrible
and
i
due
in
london
at
the
inquest
i
must
really
run
away
tell
your
readers
it
all
a
police
grudge
one
last
word
mortlake
if
you
please
is
it
true
that
you
were
billed
to
preside
at
a
great
meeting
of
clerks
at
james
hall
between
one
and
two
to
protest
against
the
german
invasion
whew
so
i
had
but
the
beggars
arrested
me
just
before
one
when
i
was
going
to
wire
and
then
the
news
of
poor
constant
end
drove
it
out
of
my
head
what
a
nuisance
lord
how
troubles
do
come
together
well
send
me
a
copy
of
the
paper
tom
mortlake
evidence
at
the
inquest
added
little
beyond
this
to
the
public
knowledge
of
his
movements
on
the
morning
of
the
mystery
the
cabman
who
drove
him
to
euston
had
written
indignantly
to
the
papers
to
say
that
he
had
picked
up
his
celebrated
fare
at
bow
railway
station
at
about
four
and
the
arrest
was
a
deliberate
insult
to
democracy
and
he
offered
to
make
an
affidavit
to
that
effect
leaving
it
dubious
to
which
effect
but
scotland
yard
betrayed
no
itch
for
the
affidavit
in
question
and
no
subsided
again
into
the
obscurity
of
his
rank
mortlake
whose
face
was
very
pale
below
the
black
mane
brushed
back
from
his
fine
forehead
gave
his
evidence
in
low
sympathetic
tones
he
had
known
the
deceased
for
over
a
year
coming
constantly
across
him
in
their
common
political
and
social
work
and
had
found
the
furnished
rooms
for
him
in
glover
street
at
his
own
request
they
just
being
to
let
when
constant
resolved
to
leave
his
rooms
at
oxford
house
in
bethnal
green
and
to
share
the
actual
life
of
the
people
the
locality
suited
the
deceased
as
being
near
the
palace
he
respected
and
admired
the
deceased
whose
genuine
goodness
had
won
all
hearts
the
deceased
was
an
untiring
worker
never
grumbled
was
always
in
fair
spirits
regarded
his
life
and
wealth
as
a
sacred
trust
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
he
had
last
seen
him
at
a
quarter
past
nine
on
the
day
preceding
his
death
he
witness
had
received
a
letter
by
the
last
post
which
made
him
uneasy
about
a
friend
deceased
was
evidently
suffering
from
toothache
and
was
fixing
a
piece
of
in
a
hollow
tooth
but
he
did
not
complain
deceased
seemed
rather
upset
by
the
news
he
brought
and
they
both
discussed
it
rather
excitedly
by
a
juryman
did
the
news
concern
him
mortlake
only
impersonally
he
knew
my
friend
and
was
keenly
sympathetic
when
one
was
in
trouble
coroner
could
you
show
the
jury
the
letter
you
received
mortlake
i
have
mislaid
it
and
can
not
make
out
where
it
has
got
to
if
you
sir
think
it
relevant
or
essential
i
will
state
what
the
trouble
was
coroner
was
the
toothache
very
violent
mortlake
i
can
not
tell
i
think
not
though
he
told
me
it
had
disturbed
his
rest
the
night
before
coroner
what
time
did
you
leave
him
mortlake
about
twenty
to
ten
coroner
and
what
did
you
do
then
mortlake
i
went
out
for
an
hour
or
so
to
make
some
inquiries
then
i
returned
and
told
my
landlady
i
should
be
leaving
by
an
early
train
for
for
the
country
coroner
and
that
was
the
last
you
saw
of
the
deceased
mortlake
with
emotion
the
last
coroner
how
was
he
when
you
left
him
mortlake
mainly
concerned
about
my
trouble
coroner
otherwise
you
saw
nothing
unusual
about
him
mortlake
nothing
coroner
what
time
did
you
leave
the
house
on
tuesday
morning
mortlake
at
about
five
and
twenty
minutes
past
four
coroner
are
you
sure
that
you
shut
the
street
door
mortlake
quite
sure
knowing
my
landlady
was
rather
a
timid
person
i
even
slipped
the
bolt
of
the
big
lock
which
was
usually
tied
back
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
get
in
even
with
a
drabdump
evidence
which
of
course
preceded
his
was
more
important
and
occupied
a
considerable
time
unduly
eked
out
by
drabdumpian
padding
thus
she
not
only
deposed
that
mr
constant
had
the
toothache
but
that
it
was
going
to
last
about
a
week
in
indifference
to
the
radical
cure
that
had
been
effected
her
account
of
the
last
hours
of
the
deceased
tallied
with
mortlake
only
that
she
feared
mortlake
was
quarreling
with
him
over
something
in
the
letter
that
came
by
the
nine
post
deceased
had
left
the
house
a
little
after
mortlake
but
had
returned
before
him
and
had
gone
straight
to
his
bedroom
she
had
not
actually
seen
him
come
in
having
been
in
the
kitchen
but
she
heard
his
followed
by
his
light
step
up
the
stairs
a
juryman
how
do
you
know
it
was
not
somebody
else
sensation
of
which
the
juryman
tries
to
look
unconscious
witness
he
called
down
to
me
over
the
banisters
and
says
in
his
sweetish
voice
be
hextra
sure
to
wake
me
at
a
quarter
to
seven
drabdump
or
else
i
sha
get
to
my
tram
meeting
juryman
collapses
coroner
and
did
you
wake
him
drabdump
breaking
down
oh
my
lud
how
can
you
ask
coroner
there
there
compose
yourself
i
mean
did
you
try
to
wake
him
drabdump
i
have
taken
in
and
done
for
lodgers
this
seventeen
years
my
lud
and
have
always
gave
satisfaction
and
mortlake
he
would
ha
recommended
me
otherwise
though
i
wish
to
heaven
the
poor
gentleman
had
never
coroner
yes
yes
of
course
you
tried
to
rouse
him
but
it
was
some
time
before
drabdump
was
sufficiently
calm
to
explain
that
though
she
had
overslept
herself
and
though
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
anyhow
she
had
come
up
to
time
bit
by
bit
the
tragic
story
was
forced
from
her
lips
a
tragedy
that
even
her
telling
could
not
make
tawdry
she
told
with
superfluous
detail
how
when
grodman
broke
in
the
door
she
saw
her
unhappy
gentleman
lodger
lying
on
his
back
in
bed
stone
dead
with
a
gaping
red
wound
in
his
throat
how
her
companion
calmed
her
a
little
by
spreading
a
handkerchief
over
the
distorted
face
how
they
then
looked
vainly
about
and
under
the
bed
for
any
instrument
by
which
the
deed
could
have
been
done
the
veteran
detective
carefully
making
a
rapid
inventory
of
the
contents
of
the
room
and
taking
notes
of
the
precise
position
and
condition
of
the
body
before
anything
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
gapers
or
bunglers
how
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
that
both
the
windows
were
firmly
bolted
to
keep
out
the
cold
night
air
how
having
noted
this
down
with
a
puzzled
pitying
shake
of
the
head
he
had
opened
the
window
to
summon
the
police
and
espied
in
the
fog
one
denzil
cantercot
whom
he
called
and
told
to
run
to
the
nearest
and
ask
them
to
send
on
an
inspector
and
a
surgeon
how
they
both
remained
in
the
room
till
the
police
arrived
grodman
pondering
deeply
the
while
and
making
notes
every
now
and
again
as
fresh
points
occurred
to
him
and
asking
her
questions
about
the
poor
young
man
pressed
as
to
what
she
meant
by
calling
the
deceased
she
replied
that
some
of
her
neighbors
wrote
him
begging
letters
though
heaven
knew
they
were
better
off
than
herself
who
had
to
scrape
her
fingers
to
the
bone
for
every
penny
she
earned
under
further
pressure
from
talbot
who
was
watching
the
inquiry
on
behalf
of
arthur
family
drabdump
admitted
that
the
deceased
had
behaved
like
a
human
being
nor
was
there
anything
externally
eccentric
or
queer
in
his
conduct
he
was
always
cheerful
and
pleasant
spoken
though
certainly
soft
god
rest
his
soul
no
he
never
shaved
but
wore
all
the
hair
that
heaven
had
given
him
by
a
juryman
she
thought
deceased
was
in
the
habit
of
locking
his
door
when
he
went
to
bed
of
course
she
could
say
for
certain
laughter
there
was
no
need
to
bolt
the
door
as
well
the
bolt
slid
upward
and
was
at
the
top
of
the
door
when
she
first
let
lodgings
her
reasons
for
which
she
seemed
anxious
to
publish
there
had
only
been
a
bolt
but
a
suspicious
lodger
she
would
not
call
him
a
gentleman
had
complained
that
he
could
not
fasten
his
door
behind
him
and
so
she
had
been
put
to
the
expense
of
having
a
lock
made
the
complaining
lodger
went
off
soon
after
without
paying
his
rent
laughter
she
had
always
known
he
would
the
coroner
was
deceased
at
all
nervous
witness
no
he
was
a
very
nice
gentleman
a
laugh
coroner
i
mean
did
he
seem
afraid
of
being
robbed
witness
no
he
was
always
goin
to
demonstrations
laughter
i
told
him
to
be
careful
i
told
him
i
lost
a
purse
with
myself
on
jubilee
day
drabdump
resumed
her
seat
weeping
vaguely
the
coroner
gentlemen
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
viewing
the
room
shortly
the
story
of
the
discovery
of
the
body
was
retold
though
more
scientifically
by
george
grodman
whose
unexpected
resurgence
into
the
realm
of
his
early
exploits
excited
as
keen
a
curiosity
as
the
reappearance
for
this
occasion
only
of
a
retired
prima
donna
his
book
criminals
i
have
caught
passed
from
the
to
the
edition
merely
on
the
strength
of
it
grodman
stated
that
the
body
was
still
warm
when
he
found
it
he
thought
that
death
was
quite
recent
the
door
he
had
had
to
burst
was
bolted
as
well
as
locked
he
confirmed
drabdump
statement
about
the
windows
the
chimney
was
very
narrow
the
cut
looked
as
if
done
by
a
razor
there
was
no
instrument
lying
about
the
room
he
had
known
the
deceased
about
a
month
he
seemed
a
very
earnest
young
fellow
who
spoke
a
great
deal
about
the
brotherhood
of
man
the
hardened
old
voice
was
not
free
from
a
tremor
as
he
spoke
jerkily
of
the
dead
enthusiasms
he
should
have
thought
the
deceased
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
commit
suicide
denzil
cantercot
was
next
called
he
was
a
poet
laughter
he
was
on
his
way
to
grodman
house
to
tell
him
he
had
been
unable
to
do
some
writing
for
him
because
he
was
suffering
from
writer
cramp
when
grodman
called
to
him
from
the
window
of
no
and
asked
him
to
run
for
the
police
no
he
did
not
run
he
was
a
philosopher
laughter
he
returned
with
them
to
the
door
but
did
not
go
up
he
had
no
stomach
for
crude
sensations
laughter
the
gray
fog
was
sufficiently
unbeautiful
for
him
for
one
morning
laughter
inspector
howlett
said
about
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
december
from
information
received
he
went
with
sergeant
runnymede
and
robinson
to
glover
street
bow
and
there
found
the
dead
body
of
a
young
man
lying
on
his
back
with
his
throat
cut
the
door
of
the
room
had
been
smashed
in
and
the
lock
and
the
bolt
evidently
forced
the
room
was
tidy
there
were
no
marks
of
blood
on
the
floor
a
purse
full
of
gold
was
on
the
beside
a
big
book
a
with
cold
water
stood
beside
the
bed
over
which
was
a
hanging
bookcase
there
was
a
large
wardrobe
against
the
wall
next
to
the
door
the
chimney
was
very
narrow
there
were
two
windows
one
bolted
it
was
about
feet
to
the
pavement
there
was
no
way
of
climbing
up
no
one
could
possibly
have
got
out
of
the
room
and
then
bolted
the
doors
and
windows
behind
him
and
he
had
searched
all
parts
of
the
room
in
which
anyone
might
have
been
concealed
he
had
been
unable
to
find
any
instrument
in
the
room
in
spite
of
exhaustive
search
there
being
not
even
a
penknife
in
the
pockets
of
the
clothes
of
the
deceased
which
lay
on
a
chair
the
house
and
the
back
yard
and
the
adjacent
pavement
had
also
been
fruitlessly
searched
sergeant
runnymede
made
an
identical
statement
saving
only
that
he
had
gone
with
robinson
and
inspector
howlett
robinson
divisional
surgeon
said
the
deceased
was
lying
on
his
back
with
his
throat
cut
the
body
was
not
yet
cold
the
abdominal
region
being
quite
warm
rigor
mortis
had
set
in
in
the
lower
jaw
neck
and
upper
extremities
the
muscles
contracted
when
beaten
i
inferred
that
life
had
been
extinct
some
two
or
three
hours
probably
not
longer
it
might
have
been
less
the
bedclothes
would
keep
the
lower
part
warm
for
some
time
the
wound
which
was
a
deep
one
was
inches
from
right
to
left
across
the
throat
to
a
point
under
the
left
ear
the
upper
portion
of
the
windpipe
was
severed
and
likewise
the
jugular
vein
the
muscular
coating
of
the
carotid
artery
was
divided
there
was
a
slight
cut
as
if
in
continuation
of
the
wound
on
the
thumb
of
the
left
hand
the
hands
were
clasped
underneath
the
head
there
was
no
blood
on
the
right
hand
the
wound
could
not
have
been
a
sharp
instrument
had
been
used
such
as
a
razor
the
cut
might
have
been
made
by
a
person
no
doubt
death
was
practically
instantaneous
i
saw
no
signs
of
a
struggle
about
the
body
or
the
room
i
noticed
a
purse
on
the
lying
next
to
madame
blavatsky
big
book
on
theosophy
sergeant
runnymede
drew
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
door
had
evidently
been
locked
and
bolted
from
within
by
a
juryman
i
do
not
say
the
cuts
could
not
have
been
made
by
a
person
i
can
offer
no
suggestion
as
to
how
the
inflicter
of
the
wound
got
in
or
out
extremely
improbable
that
the
cut
was
there
was
little
trace
of
the
outside

chapter
iii
before
the
inquiry
was
resumed
all
the
poor
wretches
in
custody
had
been
released
on
suspicion
that
they
were
innocent
there
was
not
a
single
case
even
for
a
magistrate
clues
which
at
such
seasons
are
gathered
by
the
police
like
blackberries
off
the

were
scanty
and
unripe
inferior
specimens
were
offered
them
by
bushels
but
there
was
not
a
good
one
among
the
lot
the
police
could
not
even
manufacture
a
clue
arthur
constant
death
was
already
the
theme
of
every
hearth
railway
carriage
and
public
house
the
dead
idealist
had
points
of
contact
with
so
many
spheres
the
east
end
and
west
end
alike
were
moved
and
excited
the
democratic
leagues
and
the
churches
the
and
the
universities
the
pity
of
it
and
then
the
impenetrable
mystery
of
it
the
evidence
given
in
the
concluding
portion
of
the
investigation
was
necessarily
less
sensational
there
were
no
more
witnesses
to
bring
the
scent
of
blood
over
the
coroner
table
those
who
had
yet
to
be
heard
were
merely
relatives
and
friends
of
the
deceased
who
spoke
of
him
as
he
had
been
in
life
his
parents
were
dead
perhaps
luckily
for
them
his
relatives
had
seen
little
of
him
and
had
scarce
heard
as
much
about
him
as
the
outside
world
no
man
is
a
prophet
in
his
own
country
and
even
if
he
migrates
it
is
advisable
for
him
to
leave
his
family
at
home
his
friends
were
a
motley
crew
friends
of
the
same
friend
are
not
necessarily
friends
of
one
another
but
their
diversity
only
made
the
congruity
of
the
tale
they
had
to
tell
more
striking
it
was
the
tale
of
a
man
who
had
never
made
an
enemy
even
by
benefiting
him
nor
lost
a
friend
even
by
refusing
his
favors
the
tale
of
a
man
whose
heart
overflowed
with
peace
and
good
will
to
all
men
all
the
year
round
of
a
man
to
whom
christmas
came
not
once
but
three
hundred
and
times
a
year
it
was
the
tale
of
a
brilliant
intellect
who
gave
up
to
mankind
what
was
meant
for
himself
and
worked
as
a
laborer
in
the
vineyard
of
humanity
never
crying
that
the
grapes
were
sour
of
a
man
uniformly
cheerful
and
of
good
courage
living
in
that
forgetfulness
of
self
which
is
the
truest
antidote
to
despair
and
yet
there
was
not
quite
wanting
the
note
of
pain
to
jar
the
harmony
and
make
it
human
richard
elton
his
chum
from
boyhood
and
vicar
of
somerton
in
midlandshire
handed
to
the
coroner
a
letter
from
the
deceased
about
ten
days
before
his
death
containing
some
passages
which
the
coroner
read
aloud
do
you
know
anything
of
schopenhauer
i
mean
anything
beyond
the
current
misconceptions
i
have
been
making
his
acquaintance
lately
he
is
an
agreeable
rattle
of
a
pessimist
his
essay
on
misery
of
mankind
is
quite
lively
reading
at
first
his
assimilation
of
christianity
and
pessimism
it
occurs
in
his
essay
on
dazzled
me
as
an
audacious
paradox
but
there
is
truth
in
it
verily
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
and
man
is
a
degraded
monster
and
sin
is
over
all
ah
my
friend
i
have
shed
many
of
my
illusions
since
i
came
to
this
seething
hive
of
misery
and
wrongdoing
what
shall
one
man
life
a
million
men
lives
avail
against
the
corruption
the
vulgarity
and
the
squalor
of
civilization
sometimes
i
feel
like
a
farthing
in
the
hall
of
eblis
selfishness
is
so
long
and
life
so
short
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
everybody
is
so
beastly
contented
the
poor
no
more
desire
comfort
than
the
rich
culture
the
woman
to
whom
a
penny
school
fee
for
her
child
represents
an
appreciable

must
have
organized

party
in
his
salad
days
and
yet
one
ca
help
feeling
that
he
committed
suicide
as
a

by
not
committing
it
as
a
man
he
claims
kinship
with

too
though
esoteric
buddhism
at
least
seems
spheres
removed
from
the
philosophy
of

and
the
idea
what
a
wonderful

madame

must
be
i
ca
say
i
follow
her
for
she
is
up
in

nearly
all

and
i
have
as
yet
developed

shall
i
send
you
on

it
is
fascinating
i
am
becoming
quite
a
fluent
orator
one
soon
gets
into
the
way
of
it
the
horrible
thing
is
that
you
catch
yourself
saying
things
to
lead
up
to
instead
of
sticking
to
the
plain
realities
of
the
business
lucy
is
still
doing
the
galleries
in
italy
it
used
to
pain
me
sometimes
to
think
of
my
darling
happiness
when
i
came
across
a
factory
girl
now
i
feel
her
happiness
is
as
important
as
a

lucy
the
witness
explained
was
lucy
brent
the
betrothed
of
the
deceased
the
poor
girl
had
been
telegraphed
for
and
had
started
for
england
the
witness
stated
that
the
outburst
of
despondency
in
this
letter
was
almost
a
solitary
one
most
of
the
letters
in
his
possession
being
bright
buoyant
and
hopeful
even
this
letter
ended
with
a
humorous
statement
of
the
writer
manifold
plans
and
projects
for
the
new
year
the
deceased
was
a
good
churchman
coroner
was
there
any
private
trouble
in
his
own
life
to
account
for
the
temporary
despondency
witness
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware
his
financial
position
was
exceptionally
favorable
coroner
there
had
been
no
quarrel
with
miss
brent
witness
i
have
the
best
authority
for
saying
that
no
shadow
of
difference
had
ever
come
between
them
coroner
was
the
deceased
witness
certainly
not
he
was
not
even
ambidextrous
a
juryman
is
shoppinhour
one
of
the
infidel
writers
published
by
the
freethought
publication
society
witness
i
do
not
know
who
publishes
his
books
the
juryman
a
small
grocer
and
big
scotchman
rejoicing
in
the
name
of
sandy
sanderson
and
the
dignities
of
deaconry
and
membership
of
the

of
the
bow
conservative
association
no
equeevocation
sir
is
he
not
a
secularist
who
has
lectured
at
the
hall
of
science
witness
no
he
is
a
foreign
writer
sanderson
was
heard
to
thank
heaven
for
this
small
mercy
who
believes
that
life
is
not
worth
living
the
juryman
were
you
not
shocked
to
find
the
friend
of
a
meenister
reading
such
impure
leeterature
witness
the
deceased
read
everything
schopenhauer
is
the
author
of
a
system
of
philosophy
and
not
what
you
seem
to
imagine
perhaps
you
would
like
to
inspect
the
book
laughter
the
juryman
i
would
na
touch
it
with
a
pitchfork
such
books
should
be
burnt
and
this
madame
blavatsky
book
what
is
that
is
that
also
pheelosophy
witness
no
it
is
theosophy

allen
smith
secretary
of
the
trammel
union
stated
that
he
had
had
an
interview
with
the
deceased
on
the
day
before
his
death
when
he
the
deceased
spoke
hopefully
of
the
prospects
of
the
movement
and
wrote
him
out
a
check
for
guineas
for
his
union
deceased
promised
to
speak
at
a
meeting
called
for
a
quarter
past
seven
the
next
day
edward
wimp
of
the
scotland
yard
detective
department
said
that
the
letters
and
papers
of
the
deceased
threw
no
light
upon
the
manner
of
his
death
and
they
would
be
handed
back
to
the
family
his
department
had
not
formed
any
theory
on
the
subject
the
coroner
proceeded
to
sum
up
the
evidence
we
have
to
deal
gentlemen
he
said
with
a
most
incomprehensible
and
mysterious
case
the
details
of
which
are
yet
astonishingly
simple
on
the
morning
of
tuesday
the
drabdump
a
worthy
widow
who
lets
lodgings
at
grover
street
bow
was
unable
to
arouse
the
deceased
who
occupied
the
entire
upper
floor
of
the
house
becoming
alarmed
she
went
across
to
fetch
george
grodman
a
gentleman
known
to
us
all
by
reputation
and
to
whose
clear
and
scientific
evidence
we
are
much
indebted
and
got
him
to
batter
in
the
door
they
found
the
deceased
lying
back
in
bed
with
a
deep
wound
in
his
throat
life
had
only
recently
become
extinct
there
was
no
trace
of
any
instrument
by
which
the
cut
could
have
been
effected
there
was
no
trace
of
any
person
who
could
have
effected
the
cut
no
person
could
apparently
have
got
in
or
out
the
medical
evidence
goes
to
show
that
the
deceased
could
not
have
inflicted
the
wound
himself
and
yet
gentlemen
there
are
in
the
nature
of
things
two
and
only
two
alternative
explanations
of
his
death
either
the
wound
was
inflicted
by
his
own
hand
or
it
was
inflicted
by
another
i
shall
take
each
of
these
possibilities
separately
first
did
the
deceased
commit
suicide
the
medical
evidence
says
deceased
was
lying
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
now
the
wound
was
made
from
right
to
left
and
terminated
by
a
cut
on
the
left
thumb
if
the
deceased
had
made
it
he
would
have
had
to
do
it
with
his
right
hand
while
his
left
hand
remained
under
his
head
a
most
peculiar
and
unnatural
position
to
assume
moreover
in
making
a
cut
with
the
right
hand
one
would
naturally
move
the
hand
from
left
to
right
it
is
unlikely
that
the
deceased
would
move
his
right
hand
so
awkwardly
and
unnaturally
unless
of
course
his
object
was
to
baffle
suspicion
another
point
is
that
on
this
hypothesis
the
deceased
would
have
had
to
replace
his
right
hand
beneath
his
head
but
robinson
believes
that
death
was
instantaneous
if
so
deceased
could
have
had
no
time
to
pose
so
neatly
it
is
just
possible
the
cut
was
made
with
the
left
hand
but
then
the
deceased
was
the
absence
of
any
signs
of
a
possible
weapon
undoubtedly
goes
to
corroborate
the
medical
evidence
the
police
have
made
an
exhaustive
search
in
all
places
where
the
razor
or
other
weapon
or
instrument
might
by
any
possibility
have
been
concealed
including
the
bedclothes
the
mattress
the
pillow
and
the
street
into
which
it
might
have
been
dropped
but
all
theories
involving
the
willful
concealment
of
the
fatal
instrument
have
to
reckon
with
the
fact
or
probability
that
death
was
instantaneous
also
with
the
fact
that
there
was
no
blood
about
the
floor
finally
the
instrument
used
was
in
all
likelihood
a
razor
and
the
deceased
did
not
shave
and
was
never
known
to
be
in
possession
of
any
such
instrument
if
then
we
were
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
medical
and
police
evidence
there
would
i
think
be
little
hesitation
in
dismissing
the
idea
of
suicide
nevertheless
it
is
well
to
forget
the
physical
aspect
of
the
case
for
a
moment
and
to
apply
our
minds
to
an
unprejudiced
inquiry
into
the
mental
aspect
of
it
was
there
any
reason
why
the
deceased
should
wish
to
take
his
own
life
he
was
young
wealthy
and
popular
loving
and
loved
life
stretched
fair
before
him
he
had
no
vices
plain
living
high
thinking
and
noble
doing
were
the
three
guiding
stars
of
his
life
if
he
had
had
ambition
an
illustrious
public
career
was
within
reach
he
was
an
orator
of
no
mean
power
a
brilliant
and
industrious
man
his
outlook
was
always
on
the
future
he
was
always
sketching
out
ways
in
which
he
could
be
useful
to
his
his
purse
and
his
time
were
ever
at
the
command
of
whosoever
could
show
fair
claim
upon
them
if
such
a
man
were
likely
to
end
his
own
life
the
science
of
human
nature
would
be
at
an
end
still
some
of
the
shadows
of
the
picture
have
been
presented
to
us
the
man
had
his
moments
of
despondency
as
which
of
us
has
not
but
they
seem
to
have
been
few
and
passing
anyhow
he
was
cheerful
enough
on
the
day
before
his
death
he
was
suffering
too
from
toothache
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
violent
nor
did
he
complain
possibly
of
course
the
pain
became
very
acute
in
the
night
nor
must
we
forget
that
he
may
have
overworked
himself
and
got
his
nerves
into
a
morbid
state
he
worked
very
hard
never
rising
later
than
seven
and
doing
far
more
than
the
professional
leader
he
taught
and
wrote
as
well
as
spoke
and
organized
but
on
the
other
hand
all
witnesses
agree
that
he
was
looking
forward
eagerly
to
the
meeting
of
on
the
morning
of
the
inst
his
whole
heart
was
in
the
movement
is
it
likely
that
this
was
the
night
he
would
choose
for
quitting
the
scene
of
his
usefulness
is
it
likely
that
if
he
had
chosen
it
he
would
not
have
left
letters
and
a
statement
behind
or
made
a
last
will
and
testament
wimp
has
found
no
possible
clue
to
such
conduct
in
his
papers
or
is
it
likely
he
would
have
concealed
the
instrument
the
only
positive
sign
of
intention
is
the
bolting
of
his
door
in
addition
to
the
usual
locking
of
it
but
one
can
not
lay
much
stress
on
that
regarding
the
mental
aspects
alone
the
balance
is
largely
against
suicide
looking
at
the
physical
aspects
suicide
is
well
nigh
impossible
putting
the
two
together
the
case
against
suicide
is
all
but
mathematically
complete
the
answer
then
to
our
first
question
did
the
deceased
commit
suicide
is
that
he
did
not
the
coroner
paused
and
everybody
drew
a
long
breath
the
lucid
exposition
had
been
followed
with
admiration
if
the
coroner
had
stopped
now
the
jury
would
have
unhesitatingly
returned
a
verdict
of
murder
but
the
coroner
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
water
and
went
on
we
now
come
to
the
second
alternative
was
the
deceased
the
victim
of
homicide
in
order
to
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative
it
is
essential
that
we
should
be
able
to
form
some
conception
of
the
it
is
all
very
well
for
robinson
to
say
the
cut
was
made
by
another
hand
but
in
the
absence
of
any
theory
as
to
how
the
cut
could
possibly
have
been
made
by
that
other
hand
we
should
be
driven
back
to
the
theory
of
however
improbable
it
may
seem
to
medical
gentlemen
now
what
are
the
facts
when
drabdump
and
grodman
found
the
body
it
was
yet
warm
and
grodman
a
witness
fortunately
qualified
by
special
experience
states
that
death
had
been
quite
recent
this
tallies
closely
enough
with
the
view
of
robinson
who
examining
the
body
about
an
hour
later
put
the
time
of
death
at
two
or
three
hours
before
say
seven
drabdump
had
attempted
to
wake
the
deceased
at
a
quarter
to
seven
which
would
put
back
the
act
to
a
little
earlier
as
i
understand
from
robinson
that
it
is
impossible
to
fix
the
time
very
precisely
death
may
have
very
well
taken
place
several
hours
before
drabdump
first
attempt
to
wake
deceased
of
course
it
may
have
taken
place
between
the
first
and
second
calls
as
he
may
merely
have
been
sound
asleep
at
first
it
may
also
not
impossibly
have
taken
place
considerably
earlier
than
the
first
call
for
all
the
physical
data
seem
to
prove
nevertheless
on
the
whole
i
think
we
shall
be
least
likely
to
err
if
we
assume
the
time
of
death
to
be
six
gentlemen
let
us
picture
to
ourselves
no
glover
street
at
six
we
have
seen
the
house
we
know
exactly
how
it
is
constructed
on
the
ground
floor
a
front
room
tenanted
by
mortlake
with
two
windows
giving
on
the
street
both
securely
bolted
a
back
room
occupied
by
the
landlady
and
a
kitchen
drabdump
did
not
leave
her
bedroom
till
six
so
that
we
may
be
sure
all
the
various
doors
and
windows
have
not
yet
been
unfastened
while
the
season
of
the
year
is
a
guarantee
that
nothing
had
been
left
open
the
front
door
through
which
mortlake
has
gone
out
before
four
is
guarded
by
the
lock
and
the
big
lock
on
the
upper
floor
are
two
rooms
a
front
room
used
by
deceased
for
a
bedroom
and
a
back
room
which
he
used
as
a
the
back
room
has
been
left
open
with
the
key
inside
but
the
window
is
fastened
the
door
of
the
front
room
is
not
only
locked
but
bolted
we
have
seen
the
splintered
mortise
and
the
staple
of
the
upper
bolt
violently
forced
from
the
woodwork
and
resting
on
the
pin
the
windows
are
bolted
the
fasteners
being
firmly
fixed
in
the
catches
the
chimney
is
too
narrow
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
even
a
child
this
room
in
fact
is
as
firmly
barred
in
as
if
besieged
it
has
no
communication
with
any
other
part
of
the
house
it
is
as
absolutely
and
isolated
as
if
it
were
a
fort
in
the
sea
or
a
in
the
forest
even
if
any
strange
person
is
in
the
house
nay
in
the
very
of
the
deceased
he
can
not
get
into
the
bedroom
for
the
house
is
one
built
for
the
poor
with
no
communication
between
the
different
rooms
so
that
separate
families
if
need
be
may
inhabit
each
now
however
let
us
grant
that
some
person
has
achieved
the
miracle
of
getting
into
the
front
room
first
floor
feet
from
the
ground
at
six
or
thereabouts
he
cuts
the
throat
of
the
sleeping
occupant
how
is
he
then
to
get
out
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
now
roused
landlady
but
let
us
concede
him
that
miracle
too
how
is
he
to
go
away
and
yet
leave
the
doors
and
windows
locked
and
bolted
from
within
this
is
a
degree
of
miracle
at
which
my
credulity
must
draw
the
line
no
the
room
had
been
closed
all
night
there
is
scarce
a
trace
of
fog
in
it
no
one
could
get
in
or
out
finally
murders
do
not
take
place
without
motive
robbery
and
revenge
are
the
only
conceivable
motives
the
deceased
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
his
money
and
valuables
were
left
untouched
everything
was
in
order
there
were
no
signs
of
a
struggle
the
answer
then
to
our
second
inquiry
was
the
deceased
killed
by
another
person
is
that
he
was
not
gentlemen
i
am
aware
that
this
sounds
impossible
and
contradictory
but
it
is
the
facts
that
contradict
themselves
it
seems
clear
that
the
deceased
did
not
commit
suicide
it
seems
equally
clear
that
the
deceased
was
not
murdered
there
is
nothing
for
it
therefore
gentlemen
but
to
return
a
verdict
tantamount
to
an
acknowledgment
of
our
incompetence
to
come
to
any
adequately
grounded
conviction
whatever
as
to
the
means
or
the
manner
by
which
the
deceased
met
his
death
it
is
the
most
inexplicable
mystery
in
all
my
experience
sensation
the
foreman
after
a
colloquy
with
sandy
sanderson
we
are
not
agreed
sir
one
of
the
jurors
insists
on
a
verdict
of
death
from
visitation
by
the
act
of
god
chapter
iv
but
sandy
sanderson
burning
solicitude
to
fix
the
crime
flickered
out
in
the
face
of
opposition
and
in
the
end
he
bowed
his
head
to
the
inevitable
open
verdict
then
the
floodgates
of
inkland
were
opened
and
the
deluge
pattered
for
nine
days
on
the
deaf
coffin
where
the
poor
idealist
moldered
the
tongues
of
the
press
were
loosened
and
the
leader
writers
reveled
in
recapitulating
the
circumstances
of
the
big
bow
mystery
though
they
could
contribute
nothing
but
adjectives
to
the
solution
the
papers
teemed
with
letters
it
was
a
kind
of
indian
summer
of
the
silly
season
but
the
editors
could
not
keep
them
out
nor
cared
to
the
mystery
was
the
one
topic
of
conversation
everywhere
it
was
on
the
carpet
and
the
bare
boards
alike
in
the
kitchen
and
the
it
was
discussed
with
science
or
stupidity
with
aspirates
or
without
it
came
up
for
breakfast
with
the
rolls
and
was
swept
off
the
supper
table
with
the
last
crumbs
no
glover
street
bow
remained
for
days
a
shrine
of
pilgrimage
the
once
sleepy
little
street
buzzed
from
morning
till
night
from
all
parts
of
the
town
people
came
to
stare
up
at
the
bedroom
window
and
wonder
with
a
foolish
look
of
horror
the
pavement
was
often
blocked
for
hours
together
and
itinerant
vendors
of
refreshment
made
it
a
new
market
center
while
vocalists
hastened
thither
to
sing
the
delectable
ditty
of
the
deed
without
having
any
voice
in
the
matter
it
was
a
pity
the
government
did
not
erect
a
at
either
end
of
the
street
but
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
rarely
avail
themselves
of
the
more
obvious
expedients
for
paying
off
the
national
debt
finally
familiarity
bred
contempt
and
the
wits
grew
facetious
at
the
expense
of
the
mystery
jokes
on
the
subject
appeared
even
in
the
comic
papers
to
the
proverb
you
must
not
say
boo
to
a
goose
one
added
or
else
she
will
explain
you
the
mystery
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
asked
whether
the
bow
mystery
was
not
shall
not
be
divulged
there
was
more
point
in
dagonet
remark
that
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
unhappy
jurymen
he
should
have
been
driven
to
suicide
a
professional
pointed
triumphantly
to
the
somewhat
similar
situation
in
the
murder
in
the
rue
morgue
and
said
that
nature
had
been
plagiarizing
again
like
the
monkey
she
was
and
he
recommended
publishers
to
apply
for
an
injunction
more
seriously
poe
solution
was
by
constant
reader
as
an
original
idea
he
thought
that
a
small
monkey
might
have
got
down
the
chimney
with
its
master
razor
and
after
attempting
to
shave
the
occupant
of
the
bed
have
returned
the
way
it
came
this
idea
created
considerable
sensation
but
a
correspondent
with
a
long
train
of
letters
draggling
after
his
name
pointed
out
that
a
monkey
small
enough
to
get
down
so
narrow
a
flue
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
inflict
so
deep
a
wound
this
was
disputed
by
a
third
writer
and
the
contest
raged
so
keenly
about
the
power
of
monkeys
muscles
that
it
was
almost
taken
for
granted
that
a
monkey
was
the
guilty
party
the
bubble
was
pricked
by
the
pen
of
common
sense
who
laconically
remarked
that
no
traces
of
soot
or
blood
had
been
discovered
on
the
floor
or
on
the
nightshirt
or
the
counterpane
the
lancet
leader
on
the
mystery
was
awaited
with
interest
it
said
we
can
not
join
in
the
praises
that
have
been
showered
upon
the
coroner
summing
up
it
shows
again
the
evils
resulting
from
having
coroners
who
are
not
medical
men
he
seems
to
have
appreciated
but
inadequately
the
significance
of
the
medical
evidence
he
should
certainly
have
directed
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
of
murder
on
that
what
was
it
to
do
with
him
that
he
could
see
no
way
by
which
the
wound
could
have
been
inflicted
by
an
outside
agency
it
was
for
the
police
to
find
how
that
was
done
enough
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
unhappy
young
man
to
have
inflicted
such
a
wound
and
then
have
strength
and
will
power
enough
to
hide
the
instrument
and
to
remove
perfectly
every
trace
of
his
having
left
the
bed
for
the
purpose
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
all
the
theories
propounded
by
the
amateur
detectives
while
scotland
yard
religiously
held
its
tongue
ultimately
the
interest
on
the
subject
became
confined
to
a
few
papers
which
had
received
the
best
letters
those
papers
that
could
get
interesting
letters
stopped
the
correspondence
and
sneered
at
the
sensationalism
of
those
that
could
among
the
mass
of
fantasy
there
were
not
a
few
notable
solutions
which
failed
brilliantly
like
rockets
posing
as
fixed
stars
one
was
that
in
the
obscurity
of
the
fog
the
murderer
had
ascended
to
the
window
of
the
bedroom
by
means
of
a
ladder
from
the
pavement
he
had
then
with
a
diamond
cut
one
of
the
panes
away
and
effected
an
entry
through
the
aperture
on
leaving
he
fixed
in
the
pane
of
glass
again
or
another
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
thus
the
room
remained
with
its
bolts
and
locks
untouched
on
its
being
pointed
out
that
the
panes
were
too
small
a
third
correspondent
showed
that
that
did
matter
as
it
was
only
necessary
to
insert
the
hand
and
undo
the
fastening
when
the
entire
window
could
be
opened
the
process
being
reversed
by
the
murderer
on
leaving
this
pretty
edifice
of
glass
was
smashed
by
a
glazier
who
wrote
to
say
that
a
pane
could
hardly
be
fixed
in
from
only
one
side
of
a
window
frame
that
it
would
fall
out
when
touched
and
that
in
any
case
the
wet
putty
could
not
have
escaped
detection
a
door
panel
sliced
out
and
replaced
was
also
put
forward
and
as
many
and
secret
passages
were
ascribed
to
no
glover
street
as
if
it
were
a
medieval
castle
another
of
these
clever
theories
was
that
the
murderer
was
in
the
room
the
whole
time
the
police
were
there
hidden
in
the
wardrobe
or
he
had
got
behind
the
door
when
grodman
broke
it
open
so
that
he
was
not
noticed
in
the
excitement
of
the
discovery
and
escaped
with
his
weapon
at
the
moment
when
grodman
and
drabdump
were
examining
the
window
fastenings
scientific
explanations
also
were
to
hand
to
explain
how
the
assassin
locked
and
bolted
the
door
behind
him
powerful
magnets
outside
the
door
had
been
used
to
turn
the
key
and
push
the
bolt
within
murderers
armed
with
magnets
loomed
on
the
popular
imagination
like
a
new
microbe
there
was
only
one
defect
in
this
ingenious
theory
the
thing
could
not
be
done
a
physiologist
recalled
the
conjurers
who
swallowed
swords
by
an
anatomical
peculiarity
of
the
throat
and
said
that
the
deceased
might
have
swallowed
the
weapon
after
cutting
his
own
throat
this
was
too
much
for
the
public
to
swallow
as
for
the
idea
that
the
suicide
had
been
effected
with
a
penknife
or
its
blade
or
a
bit
of
steel
which
had
got
buried
in
the
wound
not
even
the
quotation
of
shelley
line
makes
such
a
wound
the
knife
is
lost
in
it
could
secure
it
a
moment
acceptance
the
same
reception
was
accorded
to
the
idea
that
the
cut
had
been
made
with
a
candlestick
or
other
harmless
article
constructed
like
a
theories
of
this
sort
caused
a
humorist
to
explain
that
the
deceased
had
hidden
the
razor
in
his
hollow
tooth
some
kind
friend
of
maskelyne
and
cook
suggested
that
they
were
the
only
persons
who
could
have
done
the
deed
as
no
one
else
could
get
out
of
a
locked
cabinet
but
perhaps
the
most
brilliant
of
these
flashes
of
false
fire
was
the
facetious
yet
probably
meant
letter
that
appeared
in
the
pell
mell
press
under
the
heading
of
the
big
bow
mystery
solved
sir
you
will
remember
that
when
the
whitechapel
murders
were
agitating
the
universe
i
suggested
that
the
district
coroner
was
the
assassin
my
suggestion
has
been
disregarded
the
coroner
is
still
at
large
so
is
the
whitechapel
murderer
perhaps
this
suggestive
coincidence
will
incline
the
authorities
to
pay
more
attention
to
me
this
time
the
problem
seems
to
be
this
the
deceased
could
not
have
cut
his
own
throat
the
deceased
could
not
have
had
his
throat
cut
for
him
as
one
of
the
two
must
have
happened
this
is
obvious
nonsense
as
this
is
obvious
nonsense
i
am
justified
in
disbelieving
it
as
this
obvious
nonsense
was
primarily
put
in
circulation
by
drabdump
and
grodman
i
am
justified
in
disbelieving
them
in
short
sir
what
guarantee
have
we
that
the
whole
tale
is
not
a
story
invented
by
the
two
persons
who
first
found
the
body
what
proof
is
there
that
the
deed
was
not
done
by
these
persons
themselves
who
then
went
to
work
to
smash
the
door
and
break
the
locks
and
the
bolts
and
fasten
up
all
the
windows
before
they
called
the
police
in
i
enclose
my
card
and
am
sir
yours
truly
one
who
looks
through
his
own
spectacles
our
correspondent
theory
is
not
so
audaciously
original
as
he
seems
to
imagine
has
he
not
looked
through
the
spectacles
of
the
people
who
persistently
suggested
that
the
whitechapel
murderer
was
invariably
the
policeman
who
found
the
body
somebody
must
find
the
body
if
it
is
to
be
found
at
ed
the
editor
had
reason
to
be
pleased
that
he
inserted
this
letter
for
it
drew
the
following
interesting
communication
from
the
great
detective
himself
the
big
bow
mystery
solved
sir
i
do
not
agree
with
you
that
your
correspondent
theory
lacks
originality
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
is
delightfully
original
in
fact
it
has
given
me
an
idea
what
that
idea
is
i
do
not
yet
propose
to
say
but
if
who
looks
through
his
own
spectacles
will
favor
me
with
his
name
and
address
i
shall
be
happy
to
inform
him
a
little
before
the
rest
of
the
world
whether
his
germ
has
borne
any
fruit
i
feel
he
is
a
kindred
spirit
and
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
publicly
that
i
was
extremely
disappointed
at
the
unsatisfactory
verdict
the
thing
was
a
palpable
assassination
an
open
verdict
has
a
tendency
to
relax
the
exertions
of
scotland
yard
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
accused
of
immodesty
or
of
making
personal
reflections
when
i
say
that
the
department
has
had
several
notorious
failures
of
late
it
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
crime
is
becoming
impertinent
it
no
longer
knows
its
place
so
to
speak
it
throws
down
the
gauntlet
where
once
it
used
to
cower
in
its
fastnesses
i
repeat
i
make
these
remarks
solely
in
the
interest
of
law
and
order
i
do
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
arthur
constant
killed
himself
and
if
scotland
yard
satisfies
itself
with
that
explanation
and
turns
on
its
other
side
and
goes
to
sleep
again
then
sir
one
of
the
foulest
and
most
horrible
crimes
of
the
century
will
forever
go
unpunished
my
acquaintance
with
the
unhappy
victim
was
but
recent
still
i
saw
and
knew
enough
of
the
man
to
be
certain
and
i
hope
i
have
seen
and
known
enough
of
other
men
to
judge
that
he
was
a
man
constitutionally
incapable
of
committing
an
act
of
violence
whether
against
himself
or
anybody
else
he
would
not
hurt
a
fly
as
the
saying
goes
and
a
man
of
that
gentle
stamp
always
lacks
the
active
energy
to
lay
hands
on
himself
he
was
a
man
to
be
esteemed
in
no
common
degree
and
i
feel
proud
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
considered
me
a
friend
i
am
hardly
at
the
time
of
life
at
which
a
man
cares
to
put
on
his
harness
again
but
sir
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
ever
know
a
day
rest
till
the
perpetrator
of
this
foul
deed
is
discovered
i
have
already
put
myself
in
communication
with
the
family
of
the
victim
who
i
am
pleased
to
say
have
every
confidence
in
me
and
look
to
me
to
clear
the
name
of
their
unhappy
relative
from
the
of
suicide
i
shall
be
pleased
if
anyone
who
shares
my
distrust
of
the
authorities
and
who
has
any
clue
whatever
to
this
terrible
mystery
or
any
plausible
suggestion
to
offer
if
in
brief
any
who
looks
through
his
own
spectacles
will
communicate
with
me
if
i
were
asked
to
indicate
the
direction
in
which
new
clues
might
be
most
usefully
sought
i
should
say
in
the
first
instance
anything
is
valuable
that
helps
us
to
piece
together
a
complete
picture
of
the
manifold
activities
of
the
man
in
the
east
end
he
entered
one
way
or
another
into
the
lives
of
a
good
many
people
is
it
true
that
he
nowhere
made
enemies
with
the
best
intentions
a
man
may
wound
or
offend
his
interference
may
be
resented
he
may
even
excite
jealousy
a
young
man
like
the
late
mr
constant
could
not
have
had
as
much
practical
sagacity
as
he
had
goodness
whose
corns
did
he
tread
on
the
more
we
know
of
the
last
few
months
of
his
life
the
more
we
shall
know
of
the
manner
of
his
death
thanking
you
by
anticipation
for
the
insertion
of
this
letter
in
your
valuable
columns
i
am
sir
yours
truly
george
grodman
glover
street
bow
since
writing
the
above
lines
i
have
by
the
kindness
of
miss
brent
been
placed
in
possession
of
a
most
valuable
letter
probably
the
last
letter
written
by
the
unhappy
gentleman
it
is
dated
monday
december
the
very
eve
of
the
murder
and
was
addressed
to
her
at
florence
and
has
now
after
some
delay
followed
her
back
to
london
where
the
sad
news
unexpectedly
brought
her
it
is
a
letter
couched
on
the
whole
in
the
most
hopeful
spirit
and
speaks
in
detail
of
his
schemes
of
course
there
are
things
in
it
not
meant
for
the
ears
of
the
public
but
there
can
be
no
harm
in
transcribing
an
important
passage
seem
to
have
imbibed
the
idea
that
the
east
end
is
a
kind
of
golgotha
and
this
despite
that
the
books
out
of
which
you
probably
got
it
are
carefully
labeled
fiction
lamb
says
somewhere
that
we
think
of
the
dark
ages
as
literally
without
sunlight
and
so
i
fancy
people
like
you
dear
think
of
the
east
end
as
a
mixture
of
mire
misery
and
murder
how
that
for
alliteration
why
within
five
minutes
walk
of
me
there
are
the
loveliest
houses
with
gardens
back
and
front
inhabited
by
very
fine
people
and
furniture
many
of
my
university
friends
mouths
would
water
if
they
knew
the
income
of
some
of
the
in
the
high
road
rich
people
about
here
may
not
be
so
fashionable
as
those
in
kensington
and
bayswater
but
they
are
every
bit
as
stupid
and
materialistic
i
do
deny
lucy
i
do
have
my
black
moments
and
i
do
sometimes
pine
to
get
away
from
all
this
to
the
lands
of
sun
and
but
on
the
whole
i
am
too
busy
even
to
dream
of
dreaming
my
real
black
moments
are
when
i
doubt
if
i
am
really
doing
any
good
but
yet
on
the
whole
my
conscience
or
my
tells
me
that
i
am
if
one
can
not
do
much
with
the
mass
there
is
at
least
the
consolation
of
doing
good
to
the
individual
and
after
all
is
it
not
enough
to
have
been
an
influence
for
good
over
one
or
two
human
souls
there
are
quite
fine
characters
hereabout
especially
in
the
women
natures
capable
not
only
of
but
of
delicacy
of
sentiment
to
have
learnt
to
know
of
such
to
have
been
of
service
to
one
or
two
of
such
is
not
this
ample
return
i
could
not
get
to
james
hall
to
hear
your
friend
symphony
at
the
henschel
concert
i
have
been
reading
mme
blavatsky
latest
book
and
getting
quite
interested
in
occult
philosophy
unfortunately
i
have
to
do
all
my
reading
in
bed
and
i
do
find
the
book
as
soothing
a
soporific
as
most
new
books
for
keeping
one
awake
i
find
theosophy
as
bad
as
toothache
the
big
bow
mystery
solved
sir
i
wonder
if
anyone
besides
myself
has
been
struck
by
the
incredible
bad
taste
of
grodman
letter
in
your
last
issue
that
he
a
former
servant
of
the
department
should
publicly
insult
and
run
it
down
can
only
be
charitably
explained
by
the
supposition
that
his
judgment
is
failing
him
in
his
old
age
in
view
of
this
letter
are
the
relatives
of
the
deceased
justified
in
entrusting
him
with
any
private
documents
it
is
no
doubt
very
good
of
him
to
undertake
to
avenge
one
whom
he
seems
snobbishly
anxious
to
claim
as
a
friend
but
all
things
considered
should
not

george

read
this
letter
with
annoyance
and
crumpling
up
the
paper
murmured
scornfully
edward

chapter
yes
but
what
will
become
of
the
beautiful
said
denzil
cantercot
hang
the
beautiful
said
peter
crowl
as
if
he
were
on
the
committee
of
the
academy
give
me
the
true
denzil
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
did
happen
to
have
it
about
him
illustration
denzil
cantercot
stood
smoking
a
cigarette
denzil
cantercot
stood
smoking
a
cigarette
in
his
landlord
shop
and
imparting
an
air
of
distinction
and
an
agreeable
aroma
to
the
close
leathery
atmosphere
crowl
cobbled
away
talking
to
his
tenant
without
raising
his
eyes
he
was
a
small
sallow
man
with
a
greasy
apron
denzil
was
wearing
a
heavy
overcoat
with
a
fur
collar
he
was
never
seen
without
it
in
public
during
the
winter
in
private
he
removed
it
and
sat
in
his
shirt
sleeves
crowl
was
a
thinker
or
thought
he
was
which
seems
to
involve
original
thinking
anyway
his
hair
was
thinning
rapidly
at
the
top
as
if
his
brain
was
struggling
to
get
as
near
as
possible
to
the
realities
of
things
he
prided
himself
on
having
no
fads
few
men
are
without
some
foible
or
hobby
crowl
felt
almost
lonely
at
times
in
his
superiority
he
was
a
vegetarian
a
secularist
a
blue
ribbonite
a
republican
and
an
meat
was
a
fad
drink
was
a
fad
religion
was
a
fad
monarchy
was
a
fad
tobacco
was
a
fad
a
plain
man
like
me
crowl
used
to
say
can
live
without
fads
a
plain
man
was
crowl
catchword
when
of
a
sunday
morning
he
stood
on
waste
which
was
opposite
his
shop
and
held
forth
to
the
crowd
on
the
evils
of
kings
priests
and
mutton
chops
the
plain
man
turned
up
at
intervals
like
the
theme
of
a
symphonic
movement
i
am
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
it
was
a
phrase
that
sabered
the
of
logical
refinement
and
held
them
up
scornfully
on
the
point
when
crowl
went
for
a
little
recreation
in
victoria
park
on
sunday
afternoons
it
was
with
this
phrase
that
he
invariably
routed
the
supernaturalists
crowl
knew
his
bible
better
than
most
ministers
and
always
carried
a
copy
in
his
pocket
to
mark
contradictions
in
the
text
the
second
chapter
of
jeremiah
says
one
thing
the
first
chapter
of
corinthians
says
another
two
contradictory
statements
may
both
be
true
but
i
am
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
crowl
spent
a
large
part
of
his
time
in
setting
the
word
against
the
word
affords
its
votaries
no
acuter
pleasure
than
crowl
derived
from
setting
two
texts
by
the
ears
crowl
had
a
metaphysical
genius
which
sent
his
sunday
morning
disciples
frantic
with
admiration
and
struck
the
enemy
dumb
with
dismay
he
had
discovered
for
instance
that
the
deity
could
not
move
owing
to
already
filling
all
space
he
was
also
the
first
to
invent
for
the
confusion
of
the
clerical
the
crucial
case
of
a
saint
dying
at
the
antipodes
contemporaneously
with
another
in
london
both
went
skyward
to
heaven
yet
the
two
traveled
in
directly
opposite
directions
in
all
eternity
they
would
never
meet
which
then
got
to
heaven
or
was
there
no
such
place
i
am
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
preserve
us
our
open
spaces
they
exist
to
testify
to
the
incurable
interest
of
humanity
in
the
unknown
and
the
misunderstood
even
is
capable
of
five
minutes
attention
to
speculative
theology
if
is
in
a
peter
crowl
was
not
sorry
to
have
a
lodger
like
denzil
cantercot
who
though
a
man
of
parts
and
thus
worth
powder
and
shot
was
so
hopelessly
wrong
on
all
subjects
under
the
sun
in
only
one
point
did
peter
crowl
agree
with
denzil
cantercot
he
admired
denzil
cantercot
secretly
when
he
asked
him
for
the
true
which
was
about
twice
a
day
on
the
average
he
did
really
expect
to
get
it
from
him
he
knew
that
denzil
was
a
poet
the
beautiful
he
went
on
is
a
thing
that
only
appeals
to
men
like
you
the
true
is
for
all
men
the
majority
have
the
first
claim
till
then
you
poets
must
stand
aside
the
true
and
the
useful
that
what
we
want
the
good
of
society
is
the
only
test
of
things
everything
stands
or
falls
by
the
good
of
society
the
good
of
society
echoed
denzil
scornfully
what
the
good
of
society
the
individual
is
before
all
the
mass
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
great
man
otherwise
the
great
man
will
be
sacrificed
to
the
mass
without
great
men
there
would
be
no
art
without
art
life
would
be
a
blank
ah
but
we
should
fill
it
up
with
bread
and
butter
said
peter
crowl
yes
it
is
bread
and
butter
that
kills
the
beautiful
said
denzil
cantercot
bitterly
many
of
us
start
by
following
the
butterfly
through
the
verdant
meadows
but
we
turn
aside
to
get
the
grub
chuckled
peter
cobbling
away
peter
if
you
make
a
jest
of
everything
i
not
waste
my
time
on
you
denzil
wild
eyes
flashed
angrily
he
shook
his
long
hair
life
was
very
serious
to
him
he
never
wrote
comic
verse
intentionally
there
are
three
reasons
why
men
of
genius
have
long
hair
one
is
that
they
forget
it
is
growing
the
second
is
that
they
like
it
the
third
is
that
it
comes
cheaper
they
wear
it
long
for
the
same
reason
that
they
wear
their
hats
long
owing
to
this
peculiarity
of
genius
you
may
get
quite
a
reputation
for
lack
of
twopence
the
economic
reason
did
not
apply
to
denzil
who
could
always
get
credit
with
the
profession
on
the
strength
of
his
appearance
therefore
when
street
arabs
vocally
commanded
him
to
get
his
hair
cut
they
were
doing
no
service
to
barbers
why
does
all
the
world
watch
over
barbers
and
conspire
to
promote
their
interests
denzil
would
have
told
you
it
was
not
to
serve
the
barbers
but
to
gratify
the
instinctive
resentment
of
originality
in
his
palmy
days
denzil
had
been
an
editor
but
he
no
more
thought
of
turning
his
scissors
against
himself
than
of
swallowing
his
paste
the
efficacy
of
hair
has
changed
since
the
days
of
samson
otherwise
denzil
would
have
been
a
hercules
instead
of
a
long
thin
nervous
man
looking
too
brittle
and
delicate
to
be
used
even
for
a
the
narrow
oval
of
his
face
sloped
to
a
pointed
untrimmed
beard
his
linen
was
reproachable
his
dingy
boots
were
down
at
heel
and
his
cocked
hat
was
drab
with
dust
such
are
the
effects
of
a
love
for
the
beautiful
peter
crowl
was
impressed
with
denzil
condemnation
of
flippancy
and
he
hastened
to
turn
off
the
joke
i
quite
serious
he
said
butterflies
are
no
good
to
nothing
or
nobody
caterpillars
at
least
save
the
birds
from
starving
just
like
your
view
of
things
peter
said
denzil
good
morning
madam
this
to
crowl
to
whom
he
removed
his
hat
with
elaborate
courtesy
crowl
grunted
and
looked
at
her
husband
with
a
note
of
interrogation
in
each
eye
for
some
seconds
crowl
stuck
to
his
last
endeavoring
not
to
see
the
question
he
shifted
uneasily
on
his
stool
his
wife
coughed
grimly
he
looked
up
saw
her
towering
over
him
and
helplessly
shook
his
head
in
a
horizontal
direction
it
was
wonderful
how
crowl
towered
over
crowl
even
when
he
stood
up
in
his
shoes
she
measured
half
an
inch
less
it
was
quite
an
optical
illusion
crowl
said
crowl
then
i
tell
him
no
no
my
dear
not
yet
faltered
peter
helplessly
leave
it
to
me
i
left
it
to
you
long
enough
you
never
do
nothing
if
it
was
a
question
of
provin
to
a
lot
of
chuckleheads
that
jollygee
and
genesis
or
some
other
dead
and
gone
scripture
folk
that
do
consarn
no
mortal
soul
used
to
contradict
each
other
your
tongue
run
thirteen
to
the
dozen
but
when
it
a
matter
of
takin
the
bread
out
o
the
mouths
your
own
children
you
ai
got
no
more
to
say
for
yourself
than
a
lamppost
here
a
man
stayin
with
you
for
weeks
and
weeks
eatin
and
drinkin
the
flesh
off
your
bones
without
payin
a
far
hush
hush
mother
it
all
right
said
poor
crowl
red
as
fire
denzil
looked
at
her
dreamily
is
it
possible
you
are
alluding
to
me
mrs
crowl
he
said
who
then
should
i
be
alludin
to
cantercot
here
seven
weeks
come
and
gone
and
not
a
blessed
have
i
my
dear
crowl
said
denzil
removing
his
cigarette
from
his
mouth
with
a
pained
air
why
reproach
me
for
your
neglect
my
neglect
i
like
that
i
do
said
denzil
more
sharply
if
you
had
sent
me
in
the
bill
you
would
have
had
the
money
long
ago
how
do
you
expect
me
to
think
of
these
details
we
ai
so
grand
down
here
people
pays
their
way
they
do
get
no
bills
said
crowl
accentuating
the
word
with
infinite
scorn
peter
hammered
away
at
a
nail
as
though
to
drown
his
spouse
voice
it
three
pounds
fourteen
and
if
you
so
anxious
to
know
crowl
resumed
and
there
ai
a
woman
in
the
mile
end
road
as
it
cheaper
with
bread
at
fourpence
threefarden
a
quartern
and
landlords
clamorin
for
rent
every
monday
morning
almost
afore
the
sun
up
and
folks
draggin
and
slidderin
on
till
their
shoes
is
only
fit
to
throw
after
brides
and
christmas
comin
and
a
week
for
schoolin
peter
winced
under
the
last
item
he
had
felt
it
coming
like
christmas
his
wife
and
he
parted
company
on
the
question
of
free
education
peter
felt
that
having
brought
nine
children
into
the
world
it
was
only
fair
he
should
pay
a
penny
a
week
for
each
of
those
old
enough
to
bear
educating
his
better
half
argued
that
having
so
many
children
they
ought
in
reason
to
be
exempted
only
people
who
had
few
children
could
spare
the
penny
but
the
one
point
on
which
the
of
the
mile
end
road
got
his
way
was
this
of
the
fees
it
was
a
question
of
conscience
and
crowl
had
never
made
application
for
their
remission
though
she
often
slapped
her
children
in
vexation
instead
they
were
used
to
slapping
and
when
nobody
else
slapped
them
they
slapped
one
another
they
were
bright
brats
who
pestered
their
parents
and
worried
their
teachers
and
were
happy
as
the
road
was
long
bother
the
school
fees
peter
retorted
vexed
cantercot
not
responsible
for
your
children
i
should
hope
not
indeed
crowl
crowl
said
sternly
ashamed
of
you
and
with
that
she
flounced
out
of
the
shop
into
the
back
parlor
it
all
right
peter
called
after
her
soothingly
the
money
be
all
right
mother
in
lower
circles
it
is
customary
to
call
your
wife
your
mother
in
somewhat
superior
circles
it
is
the
fashion
to
speak
of
her
as
the
wife
as
you
speak
of
the
stock
exchange
or
the
thames
without
claiming
any
peculiar
property
instinctively
men
are
ashamed
of
being
moral
and
domesticated
denzil
puffed
his
cigarette
unembarrassed
peter
bent
attentively
over
his
work
making
nervous
stabs
with
his
awl
there
was
a
long
silence
an
played
a
waltz
outside
unregarded
and
failing
to
annoy
anybody
moved
on
denzil
lit
another
cigarette
the
clock
on
the
shop
wall
chimed
twelve
what
do
you
think
said
crowl
of
republics
they
are
low
denzil
replied
without
a
monarch
there
is
no
visible
incarnation
of
authority
what
do
you
call
queen
victoria
visible
peter
do
you
want
to
drive
me
from
the
house
leave
frivolousness
to
women
whose
minds
are
only
large
enough
for
domestic
difficulties
republics
are
low
plato
mercifully
kept
the
poets
out
of
his
republics
are
not
congenial
soil
for
poetry
what
nonsense
if
england
dropped
its
fad
of
monarchy
and
became
a
republic
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
mean
to
say
that
there
would
be
no
poet
laureate
to
begin
with
who
fribbling
now
you
or
me
cantercot
but
i
do
care
a
about
poets
present
company
always
excepted
i
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
where
the
sense
of
givin
any
one
person
authority
over
everybody
else
ah
that
what
tom
mortlake
used
to
say
wait
till
you
in
power
peter
with
money
to
control
and
working
men
bursting
to
give
you
flying
angels
and
to
carry
you
aloft
like
a
banner
huzzahing
ah
that
because
he
head
and
shoulders
above
already
said
crowl
with
a
flash
in
his
sad
gray
eyes
still
it
do
prove
that
i
talk
any
different
and
i
think
you
quite
wrong
about
his
being
spoiled
tom
a
fine
fellow
a
man
every
inch
of
him
and
that
a
good
many
i
do
deny
he
has
his
weaknesses
and
there
was
a
time
when
he
stood
in
this
very
shop
and
denounced
that
poor
dead
constant
said
he
man
do
mischief
i
do
like
these
philanthropists
mixing
themselves
up
in
practical
labor
disputes
they
do
understand
denzil
whistled
involuntarily
it
was
a
piece
of
news
i
daresay
continued
crowl
he
a
bit
jealous
of
interference
with
his
influence
but
in
this
case
the
jealousy
did
wear
off
you
see
for
the
poor
fellow
and
he
got
quite
pals
as
everybody
knows
tom
not
the
man
to
hug
a
prejudice
however
all
that
prove
nothing
against
republics
look
at
the
czar
and
the
jews
i
only
a
plain
man
but
i
would
live
in
russia
not
for
not
for
all
the
leather
in
it
an
englishman
taxed
as
he
is
to
keep
up
his
fad
of
monarchy
is
at
least
king
in
his
own
castle
whoever
bosses
it
at
windsor
excuse
me
a
minute
the
missus
is
callin
excuse
a
minute
i
going
and
i
want
to
say
before
i
go
i
feel
it
is
only
right
you
should
know
at
once
that
after
what
has
passed
i
can
never
be
on
the
same
footing
here
as
in
the
shall
i
say
pleasant
days
of
yore
oh
no
cantercot
do
say
that
do
say
that
pleaded
the
little
cobbler
well
shall
i
say
unpleasant
then
no
no
cantercot
do
misunderstand
me
mother
has
been
very
much
put
to
it
lately
to
rub
along
you
see
she
has
such
a
growing
family
it
grows
daily
but
never
mind
her
you
pay
whenever
you
got
the
money
denzil
shook
his
head
it
can
not
be
you
know
when
i
came
here
first
i
rented
your
top
room
and
boarded
myself
then
i
learnt
to
know
you
we
talked
together
of
the
beautiful
and
the
useful
i
found
you
had
no
soul
but
you
were
honest
and
i
liked
you
i
went
so
far
as
to
take
my
meals
with
your
family
i
made
myself
at
home
in
your
back
parlor
but
the
vase
has
been
shattered
i
do
not
refer
to
that
on
the
mantelpiece
and
though
the
scent
of
the
roses
may
cling
to
it
still
it
can
be
pieced
together
nevermore
he
shook
his
hair
sadly
and
shambled
out
of
the
shop
crowl
would
have
gone
after
him
but
crowl
was
still
calling
and
ladies
must
have
the
precedence
in
all
polite
societies
cantercot
went
straight
or
as
straight
as
his
loose
gait
permitted
to
glover
street
and
knocked
at
the
door
grodman
factotum
opened
it
she
was
a
person
with
a
brickdust
complexion
and
a
coquettish
manner
oh
here
we
are
again
she
said
vivaciously
do
talk
like
a
clown
cantercot
snapped
is
grodman
in
no
you
put
him
out
growled
the
gentleman
himself
suddenly
appearing
in
his
slippers
come
in
what
the
devil
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
since
the
inquest
drinking
again
i
sworn
off
have
touched
a
drop
since
the
murder
eh
said
denzil
cantercot
startled
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
since
december
i
reckon
everything
from
that
murder
now
as
they
reckon
longitude
from
greenwich
oh
said
denzil
cantercot
let
me
see
nearly
a
fortnight
what
a
long
time
to
keep
away
from
drink
and
me
i
do
know
which
is
worse
said
denzil
irritated
you
both
steal
away
my
brains
indeed
said
grodman
with
an
amused
smile
well
it
only
petty
pilfering
after
all
what
put
salt
on
your
wounds
the
edition
of
my
book
whose
book
well
your
book
you
must
be
making
piles
of
money
out
of
i
have
caught
have
caught
corrected
grodman
my
dear
denzil
how
often
am
i
to
point
out
that
i
went
through
the
experiences
that
make
the
backbone
of
my
book
not
you
in
each
case
i
cooked
the
goose
any
journalist
could
have
supplied
the
dressing
the
contrary
the
journeymen
of
journalism
would
have
left
the
truth
naked
you
yourself
could
have
done
that
for
there
is
no
man
to
beat
you
at
cold
lucid
scientific
statement
but
i
idealized
the
bare
facts
and
lifted
them
into
the
realm
of
poetry
and
literature
the
edition
of
the
book
attests
my
success
rot
the
edition
was
all
owing
to
the
murder
did
you
do
that
you
take
one
up
so
sharply
grodman
said
denzil
changing
his
tone
no
i
retired
laughed
grodman
denzil
did
not
reprove
the
flippancy
he
even
laughed
a
little
well
give
me
another
fiver
and
i
cry
i
in
debt
not
a
penny
why
have
you
been
to
see
me
since
the
murder
i
had
to
write
that
letter
to
the
mell
press
myself
you
might
have
earned
a
crown
i
had
writer
cramp
and
could
do
your
last
job
i
was
coming
to
tell
you
so
on
the
morning
of
the
murder
so
you
said
at
the
inquest
it
true
of
course
were
you
on
your
oath
it
was
very
zealous
of
you
to
get
up
so
early
to
tell
me
in
which
hand
did
you
have
this
cramp
why
in
the
right
of
course
and
you
could
write
with
your
left
i
do
think
i
could
even
hold
a
pen
or
any
other
instrument
mayhap
what
had
you
been
doing
to
bring
it
on
writing
too
much
that
is
the
only
possible
cause
oh
i
do
know
writing
what
denzil
hesitated
an
epic
poem
no
wonder
you
in
debt
will
a
sovereign
get
you
out
of
it
no
it
would
be
the
least
use
to
me
here
it
is
then
denzil
took
the
coin
and
his
hat
are
you
going
to
earn
it
you
beggar
sit
down
and
write
something
for
me
denzil
got
pen
and
paper
and
took
his
place
what
do
you
want
me
to
write
the
epic
poem
denzil
started
and
flushed
but
he
set
to
work
grodman
leaned
back
in
his
armchair
and
laughed
studying
the
poet
grave
face
denzil
wrote
three
lines
and
paused
ca
remember
any
more
well
read
me
the
start
denzil
read
of
man
first
disobedience
and
the
fruit
of
that
forbidden
tree
whose
mortal
taste
brought
death
into
the
world
hold
on
cried
grodman
what
morbid
subjects
you
choose
to
be
sure
morbid
why
milton
chose
the
same
subject
blow
milton
take
yourself
off
you
and
your
epics
denzil
went
the
person
opened
the
street
door
for
him
when
am
i
to
have
that
new
dress
dear
she
whispered
coquettishly
i
have
no
money
jane
he
said
shortly
you
have
a
sovereign
denzil
gave
her
the
sovereign
and
slammed
the
door
viciously
grodman
overheard
their
whispers
and
laughed
silently
his
hearing
was
acute
jane
had
first
introduced
denzil
to
his
acquaintance
about
two
years
ago
when
he
spoke
of
getting
an
amanuensis
and
the
poet
had
been
doing
odd
jobs
for
him
ever
since
grodman
argued
that
jane
had
her
reasons
without
knowing
them
he
got
a
hold
over
both
there
was
no
one
he
felt
he
could
not
get
a
hold
over
all
men
and
women
have
something
to
conceal
and
you
have
only
to
pretend
to
know
what
it
is
thus
grodman
who
was
nothing
if
not
scientific
denzil
cantercot
shambled
home
thoughtfully
and
abstractedly
took
his
place
at
the
crowl
chapter
vi
crowl
surveyed
denzil
cantercot
so
stonily
and
cut
him
his
beef
so
savagely
that
he
said
grace
when
the
dinner
was
over
peter
fed
his
metaphysical
genius
on
tomatoes
he
was
tolerant
enough
to
allow
his
family
to
follow
their
fads
but
no
savory
smells
ever
tempted
him
to
be
false
to
his
vegetable
loves
besides
meat
might
have
reminded
him
too
much
of
his
work
there
is
nothing
like
leather
but
bow
beefsteaks
occasionally
come
very
near
it
after
dinner
denzil
usually
indulged
in
poetic
reverie
but
he
did
not
take
his
nap
he
went
out
at
once
to
raise
the
wind
but
there
was
a
dead
calm
everywhere
in
vain
he
asked
for
an
advance
at
the
office
of
the
mile
end
mirror
to
which
he
contributed
scathing
leaderettes
about
vestrymen
in
vain
he
trudged
to
the
city
and
offered
to
write
the
ham
and
eggs
gazette
an
essay
on
the
modern
methods
of
denzil
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
breeding
and
slaughtering
of
pigs
and
drying
processes
having
for
years
dictated
the
policy
of
the
new
pork
herald
in
these
momentous
matters
denzil
also
knew
a
great
deal
about
many
other
esoteric
matters
including
weaving
machines
the
manufacture
of
cabbage
leaves
and
snuff
and
the
inner
economy
of
he
had
written
for
the
trade
papers
since
boyhood
but
there
is
great
competition
on
these
papers
so
many
men
of
literary
gifts
know
all
about
the
intricate
technicalities
of
manufactures
and
markets
and
are
eager
to
set
the
trade
right
grodman
perhaps
hardly
allowed
sufficiently
for
the
step
backward
that
denzil
made
when
he
devoted
his
whole
time
for
months
to
criminals
i
have
caught
it
was
as
damaging
as
a
debauch
for
when
your
rivals
are
pushing
forward
to
stand
still
is
to
go
back
in
despair
denzil
shambled
toilsomely
to
bethnal
green
he
paused
before
the
window
of
a
little
tobacconist
shop
wherein
was
displayed
a
placard
announcing
plots
for
sale
the
announcement
went
on
to
state
that
a
large
stock
of
plots
was
to
be
obtained
on
the
premises
embracing
sensational
plots
humorous
plots
love
plots
religious
plots
and
poetic
plots
also
complete
manuscripts
original
novels
poems
and
tales
apply
within
it
was
a
very
shop
with
begrimed
bricks
and
blackened
woodwork
the
window
contained
some
musty
old
books
an
assortment
of
pipes
and
tobacco
and
a
large
number
of
the
vilest
daubs
unhung
painted
in
oil
on
academy
boards
and
unframed
these
were
intended
for
landscapes
as
you
could
tell
from
the
titles
the
most
expensive
was
chingford
church
and
it
was
marked
the
others
ran
from
to
and
were
mostly
representations
of
scotch
scenery
a
loch
with
mountains
in
the
background
with
solid
reflections
in
the
water
and
a
tree
in
the
foreground
sometimes
the
tree
would
be
in
the
background
then
the
loch
would
be
in
the
foreground
sky
and
water
were
intensely
blue
in
all
the
name
of
the
collection
was
original
oil
paintings
done
by
hand
dust
lay
thick
upon
everything
as
if
carefully
shoveled
on
and
the
proprietor
looked
as
if
he
slept
in
his
shop
window
at
night
without
taking
his
clothes
off
he
was
a
gaunt
man
with
a
red
nose
long
but
scanty
black
locks
covered
by
a
smoking
cap
and
a
luxuriant
black
mustache
he
smoked
a
long
clay
pipe
and
had
the
air
of
a
operatic
villain
ah
good
afternoon
cantercot
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
half
from
cold
half
from
usage
what
have
you
brought
me
nothing
said
denzil
but
if
you
will
lend
me
a
sovereign
i
do
you
a
stunner
the
operatic
villain
shook
his
locks
his
eyes
full
of
pawky
cunning
if
you
did
it
after
that
it
would
be
a
stunner
what
the
operatic
villain
did
with
these
plots
and
who
bought
them
cantercot
never
knew
nor
cared
to
know
brains
are
cheap
and
denzil
was
glad
enough
to
find
a
customer
surely
you
known
me
long
enough
to
trust
me
he
cried
trust
is
dead
said
the
operatic
villain
puffing
away
so
is
queen
anne
cried
the
irritated
poet
his
eyes
took
a
dangerous
hunted
look
money
he
must
have
but
the
operatic
villain
was
inflexible
no
plot
no
supper
poor
denzil
went
out
flaming
he
knew
not
where
to
turn
temporarily
he
turned
on
his
heel
again
and
stared
despairingly
at
the
shop
window
again
he
read
the
legend
plots
for
sale
he
stared
so
long
at
this
that
it
lost
its
meaning
when
the
sense
of
the
words
suddenly
flashed
upon
him
again
they
bore
a
new
significance
he
went
in
meekly
and
borrowed
fourpence
of
the
operatic
villain
then
he
took
the
for
scotland
yard
there
was
a
not
servant
girl
in
the
the
rhythm
of
the
vehicle
shaped
itself
into
rhymes
in
his
brain
he
forgot
all
about
his
situation
and
his
object
he
had
never
really
written
an
epic
except
paradise
lost
but
he
composed
lyrics
about
wine
and
women
and
often
wept
to
think
how
miserable
he
was
but
nobody
ever
bought
anything
of
him
except
articles
on
or
attacks
on
vestrymen
he
was
a
strange
wild
creature
and
the
wench
felt
quite
pretty
under
his
ardent
gaze
it
almost
hypnotized
her
though
and
she
looked
down
at
her
new
french
kid
boots
to
escape
it
at
scotland
yard
denzil
asked
for
edward
wimp
edward
wimp
was
not
on
view
like
kings
and
editors
detectives
are
difficult
of
approach
unless
you
are
a
criminal
when
you
can
not
see
anything
of
them
at
all
denzil
knew
of
edward
wimp
principally
because
of
grodman
contempt
for
his
successor
wimp
was
a
man
of
taste
and
culture
grodman
interests
were
entirely
concentrated
on
the
problems
of
logic
and
evidence
books
about
these
formed
his
sole
reading
for
he
cared
not
a
straw
wimp
with
his
flexible
intellect
had
a
great
contempt
for
grodman
and
his
slow
laborious
ponderous
almost
teutonic
methods
worse
he
almost
threatened
to
eclipse
the
radiant
tradition
of
grodman
by
some
wonderfully
ingenious
bits
of
workmanship
wimp
was
at
his
greatest
in
collecting
circumstantial
evidence
in
putting
two
and
two
together
to
make
five
he
would
collect
together
a
number
of
dark
and
disconnected
data
and
flash
across
them
the
electric
light
of
some
unifying
hypothesis
in
a
way
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
darwin
or
a
faraday
an
intellect
which
might
have
served
to
unveil
the
secret
workings
of
nature
was
subverted
to
the
protection
of
a
capitalistic
civilization
by
the
assistance
of
a
friendly
policeman
whom
the
poet
magnetized
into
the
belief
that
his
business
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
denzil
obtained
the
great
detective
private
address
it
was
near
cross
by
a
miracle
wimp
was
at
home
in
the
afternoon
he
was
writing
when
denzil
was
ushered
up
three
pairs
of
stairs
into
his
presence
but
he
got
up
and
flashed
the
of
his
glance
upon
the
visitor
denzil
cantercot
i
believe
said
wimp
denzil
started
he
had
not
sent
up
his
name
merely
describing
himself
as
a
gentleman
that
is
my
name
he
murmured
you
were
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
inquest
on
the
body
of
the
late
arthur
constant
i
have
your
evidence
there
he
pointed
to
a
file
why
have
you
come
to
give
fresh
evidence
again
denzil
started
flushing
in
addition
this
time
i
want
money
he
said
almost
involuntarily
sit
down
denzil
sat
wimp
stood
wimp
was
young
and
he
had
a
roman
nose
and
was
smartly
dressed
he
had
beaten
grodman
by
discovering
the
wife
heaven
meant
for
him
he
had
a
bouncing
boy
who
stole
jam
out
of
the
pantry
without
anyone
being
the
wiser
wimp
did
what
work
he
could
do
at
home
in
a
secluded
study
at
the
top
of
the
house
outside
his
chamber
of
horrors
he
was
the
ordinary
husband
of
commerce
he
adored
his
wife
who
thought
poorly
of
his
intellect
but
highly
of
his
heart
in
domestic
difficulties
wimp
was
helpless
he
could
not
even
tell
whether
the
servant
character
was
forged
or
genuine
probably
he
could
not
level
himself
to
such
petty
problems
he
was
like
the
senior
wrangler
who
has
forgotten
how
to
do
quadratics
and
has
to
solve
equations
of
the
second
degree
by
the
calculus
how
much
money
do
you
want
he
asked
i
do
not
make
bargains
denzil
replied
his
calm
come
back
by
this
time
i
came
to
tender
you
a
suggestion
it
struck
me
that
you
might
offer
me
a
fiver
for
my
trouble
should
you
do
so
i
shall
not
refuse
it
you
shall
not
refuse
it
if
you
deserve
it
good
i
will
come
to
the
point
at
once
my
suggestion
concerns
tom
mortlake
denzil
threw
out
the
name
as
if
it
were
a
torpedo
wimp
did
not
move
tom
mortlake
went
on
denzil
looking
disappointed
had
a
sweetheart
he
paused
impressively
wimp
said
yes
where
is
that
sweetheart
now
where
indeed
you
know
about
her
disappearance
you
have
just
informed
me
of
it
yes
she
is
gone
without
a
trace
she
went
about
a
fortnight
before
mr
constant
murder
murder
how
do
you
know
it
was
a
murder
grodman
says
so
said
denzil
startled
again
h
is
that
rather
a
proof
that
it
was
suicide
well
go
on
about
a
fortnight
before
the
suicide
jessie
dymond
disappeared
so
they
tell
me
in
stepney
green
where
she
lodged
and
worked
what
was
she
she
was
a
dressmaker
she
had
a
wonderful
talent
quite
fashionable
ladies
got
to
know
of
it
one
of
her
dresses
was
presented
at
court
i
think
the
lady
forgot
to
pay
for
it
so
jessie
landlady
said
did
she
live
alone
she
had
no
parents
but
the
house
was
respectable
i
suppose
as
a
poet
dream
as
yours
for
instance
i
am
a
poet
i
dream
you
dream
you
are
a
poet
well
well
she
was
engaged
to
mortlake
oh
yes
they
made
no
secret
of
it
the
engagement
was
an
old
one
when
he
was
earning
a
week
as
a
compositor
they
were
saving
up
to
buy
a
home
he
worked
at
railton
and
hockes
who
print
the
pork
herald
i
used
to
take
my
into
the
comps
room
and
one
day
the
father
of
the
chapel
told
me
all
about
and
his
young
woman
ye
gods
how
times
are
changed
two
years
ago
mortlake
had
to
struggle
with
my
caligraphy
now
he
is
in
with
all
the
nobs
and
goes
to
the
of
the
aristocracy
radical
murmured
wimp
smiling
while
i
am
still
barred
from
the
dazzling
where
beauty
and
intellect
foregather
a
mere
artisan
a
manual
laborer
eyes
flashed
angrily
he
rose
with
excitement
they
say
he
always
was
a
jabberer
in
the
and
he
has
jabbered
himself
right
out
of
it
and
into
a
pretty
good
thing
he
did
have
much
to
say
about
the
crimes
of
capital
when
he
was
set
up
to
second
the
toast
of
and
hockes
at
the
beanfeast
toast
and
butter
toast
and
butter
said
wimp
genially
i
blame
a
man
for
serving
the
two
together
mr
cantercot
denzil
forced
a
laugh
yes
but
consistency
my
motto
i
like
to
see
the
royal
soul
immaculate
unchanging
immovable
by
fortune
anyhow
when
better
times
came
for
mortlake
the
engagement
still
dragged
on
he
did
not
visit
her
so
much
this
last
autumn
he
saw
very
little
of
her
how
do
you
know
i
i
was
often
in
stepney
green
my
business
took
me
past
the
house
of
an
evening
sometimes
there
was
no
light
in
her
room
that
meant
she
was
downstairs
gossiping
with
the
landlady
she
might
have
been
out
with
tom
no
sir
i
knew
tom
was
on
the
platform
somewhere
or
other
he
was
working
up
to
all
hours
organizing
the
eight
hours
working
movement
a
very
good
reason
for
relaxing
his
sweethearting
it
was
he
never
went
to
stepney
green
on
a
week
night
but
you
always
did
no
not
every
night
you
did
go
in
never
she
would
permit
my
visits
she
was
a
girl
of
strong
character
she
always
reminded
me
of
flora
macdonald
another
lady
of
your
acquaintance
a
lady
i
know
better
than
the
shadows
who
surround
me
who
is
more
real
to
me
than
the
women
who
pester
me
for
the
price
for
apartments
jessie
dymond
too
was
of
the
race
of
heroines
her
eyes
were
clear
blue
two
wells
with
truth
at
the
bottom
of
each
when
i
looked
into
those
eyes
my
own
were
dazzled
they
were
the
only
eyes
i
could
never
make
dreamy
he
waved
his
hand
as
if
making
a
pass
with
it
it
was
she
who
had
the
influence
over
me
you
knew
her
then
oh
yes
i
knew
tom
from
the
old
pork
herald
days
and
when
i
first
met
him
with
jessie
hanging
on
his
arm
he
was
quite
proud
to
introduce
her
to
a
poet
when
he
got
on
he
tried
to
shake
me
off
you
should
have
repaid
him
what
you
borrowed
it
it
was
only
a
trifle
stammered
denzil
yes
but
the
world
turns
on
trifles
said
the
wise
wimp
the
world
is
itself
a
trifle
said
the
pensive
poet
the
beautiful
alone
is
deserving
of
our
regard
and
when
the
beautiful
was
not
gossiping
with
her
landlady
did
she
gossip
with
you
as
you
passed
the
door
alas
no
she
sat
in
her
room
reading
and
cast
a
shadow
on
your
life
no
on
the
blind
always
one
shadow
no
sir
once
or
twice
two
ah
you
had
been
drinking
on
my
life
not
i
have
sworn
off
the
treacherous
that
right
beer
is
bad
for
poets
it
makes
their
feet
shaky
whose
was
the
second
shadow
a
man
naturally
mortlake
perhaps
impossible
he
was
still
striking
eight
hours
you
found
out
whose
you
did
leave
it
a
shadow
of
doubt
no
i
waited
till
the
substance
came
out
it
was
arthur
constant
you
are
a
magician
you
you
terrify
me
yes
it
was
he
only
once
or
twice
you
say
i
did
keep
watch
over
them
no
no
of
course
not
you
only
passed
casually
i
understand
you
thoroughly
denzil
did
not
feel
comfortable
at
the
assertion
what
did
he
go
there
for
wimp
went
on
i
do
know
i
stake
my
soul
on
jessie
honor
you
might
double
your
stake
without
risk
yes
i
might
i
would
you
see
her
with
my
eyes
for
the
moment
they
are
the
only
ones
available
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
the
two
together
about
the
middle
of
november
mortlake
knew
nothing
of
their
meetings
i
do
know
perhaps
he
did
mr
constant
had
probably
enlisted
her
in
his
social
mission
work
i
knew
she
was
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
big
children
tea
in
the
great
assembly
hall
early
in
november
he
treated
her
quite
like
a
lady
she
was
the
only
attendant
who
worked
with
her
hands
the
others
carried
the
cups
on
their
feet
i
suppose
no
how
could
that
be
my
meaning
is
that
all
the
other
attendants
were
real
ladies
and
jessie
was
only
an
amateur
so
to
speak
there
was
no
novelty
for
her
in
handing
kids
cups
of
tea
i
daresay
she
had
helped
her
landlady
often
enough
at
that
there
quite
a
bushel
of
brats
below
stairs
it
almost
as
bad
as
at
friend
crowl
jessie
was
a
real
brick
but
perhaps
tom
did
know
her
value
perhaps
he
did
like
constant
to
call
on
her
and
it
led
to
a
quarrel
anyhow
disappeared
like
the
snowfall
on
the
river
there
not
a
trace
the
landlady
who
was
such
a
friend
of
hers
that
jessie
used
to
make
up
her
stuff
into
dresses
for
nothing
tells
me
that
she
dreadfully
annoyed
at
not
having
been
left
the
slightest
clue
to
her
late
whereabouts
you
have
been
making
inquiries
on
your
own
account
apparently
only
of
the
landlady
jessie
never
even
gave
her
the
week
notice
but
paid
her
in
lieu
of
it
and
left
immediately
the
landlady
told
me
i
could
have
knocked
her
down
with
a
feather
unfortunately
i
there
to
do
it
for
i
should
certainly
have
knocked
her
down
for
not
keeping
her
eyes
open
better
she
says
if
she
had
only
had
the
least
suspicion
beforehand
that
the
minx
she
dared
to
call
jessie
a
minx
was
going
she
have
known
where
or
her
name
would
have
been
somebody
else
and
yet
she
admits
that
jessie
was
looking
ill
and
worried
stupid
old
hag
a
woman
of
character
murmured
the
detective
did
i
tell
you
so
cried
denzil
eagerly
another
girl
would
have
let
out
that
she
was
going
but
no
not
a
word
she
plumped
down
the
money
and
walked
out
the
landlady
ran
upstairs
none
of
jessie
things
were
there
she
must
have
quietly
sold
them
off
or
transferred
them
to
the
new
place
i
never
in
my
life
met
a
girl
who
so
thoroughly
knew
her
own
mind
or
had
a
mind
so
worth
knowing
she
always
reminded
me
of
the
maid
of
saragossa
indeed
and
when
did
she
leave
on
the
of
november
mortlake
of
course
knows
where
she
is
i
ca
say
last
time
i
was
at
the
house
to
inquire
it
was
at
the
end
of
november
he
had
been
seen
there
for
six
weeks
he
wrote
to
her
of
course
sometimes
the
landlady
knew
his
writing
wimp
looked
denzil
straight
in
the
eyes
and
said
you
mean
of
course
to
accuse
mortlake
of
the
murder
of
mr
constant
not
at
all
stammered
denzil
only
you
know
what
grodman
wrote
to
the
mell
the
more
we
know
about
mr
constant
life
the
more
we
shall
know
about
the
manner
of
his
death
i
thought
my
information
would
be
valuable
to
you
and
i
brought
it
and
why
did
you
take
it
to
mr
grodman
because
i
thought
it
would
be
valuable
to
me
you
wrote
i
have
caught
how
how
do
you
know
that
wimp
was
startling
him
with
a
vengeance
your
style
my
dear
cantercot
the
unique
noble
style
yes
i
was
afraid
it
would
betray
me
said
denzil
and
since
you
know
i
may
tell
you
that
grodman
a
mean
curmudgeon
what
does
he
want
with
all
that
money
and
those
houses
a
man
with
no
sense
of
the
beautiful
he
have
taken
my
information
and
given
me
more
kicks
than
for
it
so
to
speak
yes
he
is
a
shrewd
man
after
all
i
do
see
anything
valuable
in
your
evidence
against
mortlake
no
said
denzil
in
a
disappointed
tone
and
fearing
he
was
going
to
be
robbed
not
when
mortlake
was
already
jealous
of
mr
constant
who
was
a
sort
of
rival
organizer
unpaid
a
kind
of
blackleg
doing
the
work
cheaper
nay
for
nothing
did
mortlake
tell
you
he
was
jealous
said
wimp
a
shade
of
sarcastic
contempt
piercing
through
his
tones
oh
yes
he
said
to
me
man
will
work
mischief
i
do
like
your
philanthropists
meddling
in
matters
they
do
understand
those
were
his
very
words
his
very
well
i
have
your
address
in
my
files
here
is
a
sovereign
for
you
only
one
sovereign
it
not
the
least
use
to
me
very
well
it
of
great
use
to
me
i
have
a
wife
to
keep
i
have
said
denzil
with
a
sickly
smile
so
perhaps
i
can
manage
on
it
after
all
he
took
his
hat
and
the
sovereign
outside
the
door
he
met
a
rather
pretty
servant
just
bringing
in
some
tea
to
her
master
he
nearly
upset
her
tray
at
sight
of
her
she
seemed
more
amused
at
the
than
he
good
afternoon
dear
she
said
coquettishly
you
might
let
me
have
that
sovereign
i
do
so
want
a
new
sunday
bonnet
denzil
gave
her
the
sovereign
and
slammed
the
hall
door
viciously
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
seemed
to
be
walking
with
the
long
arm
of
coincidence
wimp
did
not
hear
the
duologue
he
was
already
busy
on
his
evening
report
to
headquarters
the
next
day
denzil
had
a
wherever
he
went
it
might
have
gratified
his
vanity
had
he
known
it
but
he
was
yet
unattended
so
no
one
noted
that
he
went
to
glover
street
after
the
early
crowl
supper
he
could
not
help
going
he
wanted
to
get
another
sovereign
he
also
itched
to
taunt
grodman
not
succeeding
in
the
former
object
he
felt
the
road
open
for
the
second
do
you
still
hope
to
discover
the
bow
murderer
he
asked
the
old
bloodhound
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
him
now
grodman
announced
curtly
denzil
hitched
his
chair
back
involuntarily
he
found
conversation
with
detectives
as
lively
as
playing
at
skittles
with
bombshells
they
got
on
his
nerves
terribly
these
undemonstrative
gentlemen
with
no
sense
of
the
beautiful
but
why
do
you
give
him
up
to
justice
he
murmured
ah
it
has
to
be
proved
yet
but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
oh
said
denzil
and
shall
i
write
the
story
for
you
no
you
will
not
live
long
enough
denzil
turned
white
nonsense
i
am
years
younger
than
you
he
gasped
yes
said
grodman
but
you
drink
so
much
chapter
vii
when
wimp
invited
grodman
to
eat
his
christmas
at
cross
grodman
was
only
a
little
surprised
the
two
men
were
always
overwhelmingly
cordial
when
they
met
in
order
to
disguise
their
mutual
detestation
when
people
really
like
each
other
they
make
no
concealment
of
their
mutual
contempt
in
his
letter
to
grodman
wimp
said
that
he
thought
it
would
be
nicer
for
him
to
keep
christmas
in
company
than
in
solitary
state
there
seems
to
be
a
general
prejudice
in
favor
of
christmas
numbers
and
grodman
yielded
to
it
besides
he
thought
that
a
peep
at
the
wimp
domestic
interior
would
be
as
good
as
a
pantomime
he
quite
enjoyed
the
fun
that
was
coming
for
he
knew
that
wimp
had
not
invited
him
out
of
mere
peace
and
goodwill
there
was
only
one
other
guest
at
the
festive
board
this
was
wife
mother
mother
a
lady
of
sweet
seventy
only
a
minority
of
mankind
can
obtain
a
by
marrying
but
wimp
was
not
unduly
conceited
the
old
lady
suffered
from
delusions
one
of
them
was
that
she
was
a
centenarian
she
dressed
for
the
part
it
is
extraordinary
what
pains
ladies
will
take
to
conceal
their
age
another
of
wimp
delusions
was
that
wimp
had
married
to
get
her
into
the
family
not
to
frustrate
his
design
she
always
gave
him
her
company
on
and
holidays
wilfred
wimp
the
little
boy
who
stole
the
jam
was
in
great
form
at
the
christmas
dinner
the
only
drawback
to
his
enjoyment
was
that
its
sweets
needed
no
stealing
his
mother
presided
over
the
platters
and
thought
how
much
cleverer
grodman
was
than
her
husband
when
the
pretty
servant
who
waited
on
them
was
momentarily
out
of
the
room
grodman
had
remarked
that
she
seemed
very
inquisitive
this
coincided
with
wimp
own
convictions
though
wimp
could
never
be
brought
to
see
anything
unsatisfactory
or
suspicious
about
the
girl
not
even
though
there
were
faults
in
spelling
in
the
character
with
which
her
last
mistress
had
supplied
her
it
was
true
that
the
puss
had
pricked
up
her
ears
when
denzil
cantercot
name
was
mentioned
grodman
saw
it
and
watched
her
and
fooled
wimp
to
the
top
of
his
bent
it
was
of
course
wimp
who
introduced
the
poet
name
and
he
did
it
so
casually
that
grodman
perceived
at
once
that
he
wished
to
pump
him
the
idea
that
the
rival
bloodhound
should
come
to
him
for
confirmation
of
suspicions
against
his
own
pet
jackal
was
too
funny
it
was
almost
as
funny
to
grodman
that
evidence
of
some
sort
should
be
obviously
lying
to
hand
in
the
bosom
of
wimp
so
obviously
that
wimp
could
not
see
it
grodman
enjoyed
his
christmas
dinner
secure
that
he
had
not
found
a
successor
after
all
wimp
for
his
part
contemptuously
wondered
at
the
way
grodman
thought
hovered
about
denzil
without
grazing
the
truth
a
man
constantly
about
him
too
denzil
is
a
man
of
genius
said
grodman
and
as
such
comes
under
the
heading
of
suspicious
characters
he
has
written
an
epic
poem
and
read
it
to
me
it
is
morbid
from
start
to
finish
there
is
in
the
third
line
i
daresay
you
know
he
polished
up
my
book
artlessness
was
perfect
no
you
surprise
me
wimp
replied
i
sure
he
could
have
done
much
to
it
look
at
your
letter
in
the
mell
who
wants
more
polish
and
refinement
than
that
showed
ah
i
did
know
you
did
me
the
honor
of
reading
that
oh
yes
we
both
read
it
put
in
wimp
i
told
wimp
it
was
clever
and
cogent
after
that
quotation
from
the
letter
to
the
poor
fellow
there
could
be
no
more
doubt
but
that
it
was
murder
wimp
was
convinced
by
it
too
were
you
edward
edward
coughed
uneasily
it
was
a
true
statement
and
therefore
an
indiscreet
grodman
would
plume
himself
terribly
at
this
moment
wimp
felt
that
grodman
had
been
right
in
remaining
a
bachelor
grodman
perceived
the
humor
of
the
situation
and
wore
a
curious
smile
on
the
day
i
was
born
said
wimp
over
a
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
babe
murdered
wimp
found
himself
wishing
it
had
been
she
he
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
cantercot
do
let
us
talk
shop
on
christmas
day
he
said
smiling
at
grodman
besides
murder
is
a
very
appropriate
subject
no
it
ai
said
grodman
how
did
we
get
on
to
it
oh
yes
denzil
cantercot
ha
ha
ha
that
curious
for
since
denzil
wrote
i
have
caught
his
mind
running
on
nothing
but
murders
a
brain
is
easily
turned
wimp
eye
glittered
with
excitement
and
contempt
for
blindness
in
grodman
eye
there
danced
an
amused
scorn
of
wimp
to
the
outsider
his
amusement
appeared
at
the
expense
of
the
poet
having
wrought
his
rival
up
to
the
highest
pitch
grodman
slyly
and
suddenly
unstrung
him
how
lucky
for
denzil
he
said
still
in
the
same
naive
facetious
christmasy
tone
that
he
can
prove
an
alibi
in
this
constant
affair
an
alibi
gasped
wimp
really
oh
yes
he
was
with
his
wife
you
know
she
my
woman
of
all
work
jane
she
happened
to
mention
his
being
with
her
jane
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
after
the
colloquy
he
had
overheard
grodman
had
set
himself
to
find
out
the
relation
between
his
two
employes
by
casually
referring
to
denzil
as
your
husband
he
so
startled
the
poor
woman
that
she
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
bond
only
once
did
he
use
the
two
words
but
he
was
satisfied
as
to
the
alibi
he
had
not
yet
troubled
her
but
to
take
its
existence
for
granted
would
upset
and
discomfort
wimp
for
the
moment
that
was
triumph
enough
for
wimp
guest
par
said
wilfred
wimp
what
a
alleybi
a
marble
no
my
lad
said
grodman
it
means
being
somewhere
else
when
supposed
to
be
somewhere
ah
playing
truant
said
wilfred
his
schoolmaster
had
often
proved
an
alibi
against
him
then
denzil
will
be
hanged
was
it
a
prophecy
wimp
accepted
it
as
such
as
an
oracle
from
the
gods
bidding
him
mistrust
grodman
out
of
the
mouths
of
little
children
issueth
wisdom
sometimes
even
when
they
are
not
saying
their
lessons
when
i
was
in
my
cradle
a
century
ago
said
men
were
hanged
for
stealing
horses
they
silenced

domestic
neither
received
any
of
the
usual
messages
from
the
christmas
bells
the
next
day
was
sloppy
and
uncertain
a
thin
rain
drizzled
languidly
one
can
stand
that
sort
of
thing
on
a
summer
bank
holiday
one
expects
it
but
to
have
a
bad
december
bank
holiday
is
too
much
of
a
bad
thing
some
steps
should
surely
be
taken
to
confuse
the
weather
chronology
once
let
him
know
that
bank
holiday
is
coming
and
he
writes
to
the
company
for
more
water
his
stock
seemed
low
and
he
was
dribbling
it
out
at
times
the
wintry
sun
would
shine
in
a
feeble
diluted
way
and
though
the
would
have
preferred
to
take
their
sunshine
neat
they
swarmed
forth
in
their
myriads
whenever
there
was
a
ray
of
hope
but
it
was
only
dodging
the
raindrops
up
went
the
umbrellas
again
and
the
streets
became
meadows
of
ambulating
mushrooms
denzil
cantercot
sat
in
his
fur
overcoat
at
the
open
window
looking
at
the
landscape
in
water
colors
he
smoked
an
cigarette
and
spoke
of
the
beautiful
crowl
was
with
him
they
were
in
the
first
floor
front
crowl
bedroom
which
from
its
view
of
the
mile
end
road
was
livelier
than
the
parlor
with
its
outlook
on
the
backyard
crowl
was
an
as
regards
the
best
bedroom
but
peter
did
not
like
to
put
the
poet
or
his
cigarette
out
he
felt
there
was
something
in
common
between
smoke
and
poetry
over
and
above
their
being
both
fads
besides
crowl
was
sulking
in
the
kitchen
she
had
been
arranging
for
an
excursion
with
peter
and
the
children
to
victoria
park
she
had
dreamed
of
the
crystal
palace
but
santa
claus
had
put
no
gifts
in
the
cobbler
shoes
now
she
could
not
risk
spoiling
the
feather
in
her
bonnet
the
nine
brats
expressed
their
disappointment
by
slapping
one
another
on
the
staircases
peter
felt
that
crowl
connected
him
in
some
way
with
the
rainfall
and
was
unhappy
was
it
not
enough
that
he
had
been
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
pointing
out
to
a
superstitious
majority
the
mutual
contradictions
of
leviticus
and
the
song
of
solomon
it
was
not
often
that
crowl
could
count
on
such
an
audience
and
you
still
call
nature
beautiful
he
said
to
denzil
pointing
to
the
ragged
sky
and
the
dripping
eaves
ugly
old
scarecrow
ugly
she
seems
admitted
denzil
but
what
is
ugliness
but
a
higher
form
of
beauty
you
have
to
look
deeper
into
it
to
see
it
such
vision
is
the
priceless
gift
of
the
few
to
me
this
wan
desolation
of
sighing
rain
is
lovely
as
the
ruins
of
cities
ah
but
you
would
like
to
go
out
in
it
said
peter
crowl
as
he
spoke
the
drizzle
suddenly
thickened
into
a
torrent
we
do
not
always
kiss
the
woman
we
love
speak
for
yourself
denzil
i
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
if
nature
is
a
fad
hallo
there
goes
mortlake
lord
a
minute
of
this
will
soak
him
to
the
skin
the
labor
leader
was
walking
along
with
bowed
head
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
shower
it
was
some
seconds
before
he
even
heard
invitation
to
him
to
take
shelter
when
he
did
hear
it
he
shook
his
head
i
know
i
ca
offer
you
a
with
duchesses
stuck
about
it
said
peter
vexed
tom
turned
the
handle
of
the
shop
door
and
went
in
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
which
now
galled
him
more
than
the
suspicion
that
he
was
and
wished
to
cut
old
friends
he
picked
his
way
through
the
nine
brats
who
clung
affectionately
to
his
wet
knees
dispersing
them
finally
by
a
jet
of
coppers
to
scramble
for
peter
met
him
on
the
stair
and
shook
his
hand
lovingly
and
admiringly
and
took
him
into
crowl
bedroom
do
mind
what
i
say
tom
i
only
a
plain
man
and
my
tongue
will
say
what
comes
uppermost
but
it
ai
from
the
soul
tom
it
ai
from
the
soul
said
peter
punning
feebly
and
letting
a
mirthless
smile
play
over
his
sallow
features
you
know
cantercot
i
suppose
the
poet
oh
yes
how
do
you
do
tom
seen
the
pork
herald
lately
not
bad
those
old
times
eh
no
said
tom
i
wish
i
was
back
in
them
nonsense
nonsense
said
peter
in
much
concern
look
at
the
good
you
are
doing
to
the
working
man
look
how
you
are
sweeping
away
the
fads
ah
it
a
grand
thing
to
be
gifted
tom
the
idea
of
your
yourself
away
on
a
composin
room
manual
labor
is
all
very
well
for
plain
men
like
me
with
no
gift
but
just
enough
brains
to
see
into
the
realities
of
things
to
understand
that
we
got
no
soul
and
no
immortality
and
all
that
and
too
selfish
to
look
after
comfort
but
my
own
and
mother
and
the
kid
but
men
like
you
and
cantercot
it
ai
right
that
you
should
be
peggin
away
at
low
material
things
not
that
i
think
cantercot
gospel
any
value
to
the
masses
the
beautiful
is
all
very
well
for
folks
who
got
nothing
else
to
think
of
but
give
me
the
true
you
the
man
for
my
money
mortlake
no
reference
to
the
funds
tom
to
which
i
contribute
little
enough
heaven
knows
though
how
a
place
can
know
anything
heaven
alone
knows
you
give
us
the
useful
tom
that
what
the
world
wants
more
than
the
beautiful
socrates
said
that
the
useful
is
the
beautiful
said
denzil
that
may
be
said
peter
but
the
beautiful
ai
the
useful
nonsense
said
denzil
what
about
jessie
i
mean
miss
dymond
a
combination
for
you
she
always
reminds
me
of
grace
darling
how
is
she
tom
she
dead
snapped
tom
what
denzil
turned
as
white
as
a
christmas
ghost
it
was
in
the
papers
said
tom
all
about
her
and
the
lifeboat
oh
you
mean
grace
darling
said
denzil
visibly
relieved
i
meant
miss
dymond
you
need
be
so
interested
in
her
said
tom
surlily
she
appreciate
it
ah
the
shower
is
over
i
must
be
going
no
stay
a
little
longer
tom
pleaded
peter
i
see
a
lot
about
you
in
the
papers
but
very
little
of
your
dear
old
phiz
now
i
ca
spare
the
time
to
go
and
hear
you
but
i
really
must
give
myself
a
treat
when
your
next
show
oh
i
am
always
giving
shows
said
tom
smiling
a
little
but
my
next
big
performance
is
on
the
of
january
when
that
picture
of
poor
mr
constant
is
to
be
unveiled
at
the
bow
break
o
day
club
they
have
written
to
gladstone
and
other
big
pots
to
come
down
i
do
hope
the
old
man
accepts
a
gathering
like
this
is
the
only
occasion
we
could
both
speak
at
and
i
have
never
been
on
the
same
platform
with
gladstone
he
forgot
his
depression
and
in
the
prospect
and
spoke
with
more
animation
no
i
should
hope
not
tom
said
peter
what
with
his
fads
about
the
bible
being
a
rock
and
monarchy
being
the
right
thing
he
is
a
most
dangerous
man
to
lead
the
radicals
he
never
lays
his
ax
to
the
root
of
anything
except
oak
trees
mr
cantycot
it
was
crowl
voice
that
broke
in
upon
the
tirade
there
a
gentleman
to
see
you
the
astonishment
crowl
put
into
the
gentleman
was
delightful
it
was
almost
as
good
as
a
week
rent
to
her
to
give
vent
to
her
feelings
the
controversial
couple
had
moved
away
from
the
window
when
tom
entered
and
had
not
noticed
the
immediate
advent
of
another
visitor
who
had
spent
his
time
profitably
in
listening
to
crowl
before
asking
to
see
the
presumable
object
of
his
visit
ask
him
up
if
it
a
friend
of
yours
cantercot
said
peter
it
was
wimp
denzil
was
rather
dubious
as
to
the
friendship
but
he
preferred
to
take
wimp
diluted
mortlake
upstairs
he
said
will
you
come
up
and
see
him
wimp
had
intended
a
duologue
but
he
made
no
objection
so
he
too
stumbled
through
the
nine
brats
to
crowl
bedroom
it
was
a
queer
quartette
wimp
had
hardly
expected
to
find
anybody
at
the
house
on
boxing
day
but
he
did
not
care
to
waste
a
day
was
not
grodman
too
on
the
track
how
lucky
it
was
that
denzil
had
made
the
first
overtures
so
that
he
could
approach
him
without
exciting
suspicion
mortlake
scowled
when
he
saw
the
detective
he
objected
to
the
police
on
principle
but
crowl
had
no
idea
who
the
visitor
was
even
when
told
his
name
he
was
rather
pleased
to
meet
one
of
friends
and
welcomed
him
warmly
probably
he
was
some
famous
editor
which
would
account
for
his
name
stirring
vague
recollections
he
summoned
the
eldest
brat
and
sent
him
for
beer
people
would
have
their
fads
and
not
without
trepidation
called
down
to
mother
for
glasses
mother
observed
at
night
in
the
same
apartment
that
the
beer
money
might
have
paid
the
week
school
fees
for
half
the
family
we
were
just
talking
of
poor
mr
constant
portrait
wimp
said
the
unconscious
crowl
they
going
to
unveil
it
mortlake
tells
me
on
the
of
next
month
at
the
bow
break
o
day
club
ah
said
wimp
elated
at
being
spared
the
trouble
of
maneuvering
the
conversation
mysterious
affair
that
mr
crowl
no
it
the
right
thing
said
peter
there
ought
to
be
some
memorial
of
the
man
in
the
district
where
he
worked
and
where
he
died
poor
chap
the
cobbler
brushed
away
a
tear
yes
it
only
right
echoed
mortlake
a
whit
eagerly
he
was
a
noble
fellow
a
true
philanthropist
the
only
thoroughly
unselfish
worker
ever
met
he
was
that
said
peter
and
it
a
rare
pattern
is
unselfishness
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
he
preached
the
useful
too
i
never
met
his
like
ah
i
wish
there
was
a
heaven
for
him
to
go
to
he
blew
his
nose
violently
with
a
red
well
he
there
if
there
said
tom
i
hope
he
is
added
wimp
fervently
but
i
should
like
to
go
there
the
way
he
did
you
were
the
last
person
to
see
him
tom
were
you
said
denzil
oh
no
answered
tom
quickly
you
remember
he
went
out
after
me
at
least
so
drabdump
said
at
the
inquest
that
last
conversation
he
had
with
you
tom
said
denzil
he
say
anything
to
you
that
would
lead
you
to
suppose
no
of
course
not
interrupted
mortlake
impatiently
do
you
really
think
he
was
murdered
tom
said
denzil
wimp
opinion
on
that
point
is
more
valuable
than
mine
replied
tom
testily
it
may
have
been
suicide
men
often
get
sick
of
life
especially
if
they
are
bored
he
added
meaningly
ah
but
you
were
the
last
person
known
to
be
with
him
said
denzil
crowl
laughed
had
you
there
tom
but
they
did
not
have
tom
there
much
longer
for
he
departed
looking
even
than
when
he
came
wimp
went
soon
after
and
crowl
and
denzil
were
left
to
their
interminable
argumentation
concerning
the
useful
and
the
beautiful
wimp
went
west
he
had
several
strings
or
cords
to
his
bow
and
he
ultimately
found
himself
at
kensal
green
cemetery
being
there
he
went
down
the
avenues
of
the
dead
to
a
grave
to
note
down
the
exact
date
of
a
death
it
was
a
day
on
which
the
dead
seemed
enviable
the
dull
sodden
sky
the
dripping
leafless
trees
the
wet
spongy
soil
the
reeking
grass
everything
combined
to
make
one
long
to
be
in
a
warm
comfortable
grave
away
from
the
leaden
ennui
of
life
suddenly
the
detective
keen
eye
caught
sight
of
a
figure
that
made
his
heart
throb
with
sudden
excitement
it
was
that
of
a
woman
in
a
gray
shawl
and
a
brown
bonnet
standing
before
a
grave
she
had
no
umbrella
the
rain
plashed
mournfully
upon
her
but
left
no
trace
on
her
soaking
garments
wimp
crept
up
behind
her
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
him
her
eyes
were
lowered
to
the
grave
which
seemed
to
be
drawing
them
toward
it
by
some
strange
morbid
fascination
his
eyes
followed
hers
the
simple
headstone
bore
the
name
arthur
constant
wimp
tapped
her
suddenly
on
the
shoulder
drabdump
went
deadly
white
she
turned
round
staring
at
wimp
without
any
recognition
you
remember
me
surely
he
said
i
been
down
once
or
twice
to
your
place
about
that
poor
gentleman
papers
his
eye
indicated
the
grave
lor
i
remember
you
now
said
drabdump
wo
you
come
under
my
umbrella
you
must
be
drenched
to
the
skin
it
do
matter
sir
i
ca
take
no
hurt
i
had
the
rheumatics
this
twenty
year
drabdump
shrank
from
accepting
wimp
attentions
not
so
much
perhaps
because
he
was
a
man
as
because
he
was
a
gentleman
drabdump
liked
to
see
the
fine
folks
keep
their
place
and
not
contaminate
their
skirts
by
contact
with
the
lower
castes
it
set
wet
it
rain
right
into
the
new
year
she
announced
and
they
say
a
bad
beginnin
makes
a
worse
endin
drabdump
was
one
of
those
persons
who
give
you
the
idea
that
they
just
missed
being
born
barometers
but
what
are
you
doing
in
this
miserable
spot
so
far
from
home
queried
the
detective
it
bank
holiday
drabdump
reminded
him
in
tones
of
acute
surprise
i
always
make
a
hexcursion
on
bank
holiday
chapter
viii
the
new
year
brought
drabdump
a
new
lodger
he
was
an
old
gentleman
with
a
long
gray
beard
he
rented
the
rooms
of
the
late
mr
constant
and
lived
a
very
retired
life
haunted
rooms
or
rooms
that
ought
to
be
haunted
if
the
ghosts
of
those
murdered
in
them
had
any
are
supposed
to
fetch
a
lower
rent
in
the
market
the
whole
irish
problem
might
be
solved
if
the
spirits
of
victims
would
only
depreciate
the
value
of
property
to
a
point
consistent
with
the
support
of
an
agricultural
population
but
drabdump
new
lodger
paid
so
much
for
his
rooms
that
he
laid
himself
open
to
a
suspicion
of
special
interest
in
ghosts
perhaps
he
was
a
member
of
the
psychical
society
the
neighborhood
imagined
him
another
mad
philanthropist
but
as
he
did
not
appear
to
be
doing
any
good
to
anybody
it
relented
and
conceded
his
sanity
mortlake
who
occasionally
stumbled
across
him
in
the
passage
did
not
trouble
himself
to
think
about
him
at
all
he
was
too
full
of
other
troubles
and
cares
though
he
worked
harder
than
ever
the
spirit
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
him
sometimes
he
forgot
himself
in
a
fine
rapture
of
eloquence
lashing
himself
up
into
a
divine
resentment
of
injustice
or
a
passion
of
sympathy
with
the
sufferings
of
his
brethren
but
mostly
he
plodded
on
in
dull
mechanical
fashion
he
still
made
brief
provincial
tours
starring
a
day
here
and
a
day
there
and
everywhere
his
admirers
remarked
how
jaded
and
overworked
he
looked
there
was
talk
of
starting
a
subscription
to
give
him
a
holiday
on
the
continent
a
luxury
obviously
unobtainable
on
the
few
pounds
allowed
him
per
week
the
new
lodger
would
doubtless
have
been
pleased
to
subscribe
for
he
seemed
quite
to
like
occupying
mortlake
chamber
the
nights
he
was
absent
though
he
was
thoughtful
enough
not
to
disturb
the
hardworked
landlady
in
the
adjoining
room
by
unseemly
noise
wimp
was
always
a
quiet
man
meantime
the
of
the
month
approached
and
the
east
end
was
in
excitement
gladstone
had
consented
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
of
unveiling
the
portrait
of
arthur
constant
presented
by
an
unknown
donor
to
the
bow
break
o
day
club
and
it
was
to
be
a
great
function
the
whole
affair
was
outside
the
lines
of
party
politics
so
that
even
conservatives
and
socialists
considered
themselves
justified
in
pestering
the
committee
for
tickets
to
say
nothing
of
ladies
as
the
committee
desired
to
be
present
themselves
of
the
applications
for
admission
had
to
be
refused
as
is
usual
on
these
occasions
the
committee
agreed
among
themselves
to
exclude
the
fair
sex
altogether
as
the
only
way
of
disposing
of
their
womankind
who
were
making
speeches
as
long
as
gladstone
each
committeeman
told
his
sisters
female
cousins
and
aunts
that
the
other
committeemen
had
insisted
on
divesting
the
function
of
all
grace
and
what
could
a
man
do
when
he
was
in
a
minority
of
one
crowl
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
break
o
day
club
was
particularly
anxious
to
hear
the
great
orator
whom
he
despised
fortunately
mortlake
remembered
the
cobbler
anxiety
to
hear
himself
and
on
the
eve
of
the
ceremony
sent
him
a
ticket
crowl
was
in
the
first
flush
of
possession
when
denzil
cantercot
returned
after
a
sudden
and
unannounced
absence
of
three
days
his
clothes
were
muddy
and
tattered
his
cocked
hat
was
deformed
his
cavalier
beard
was
matted
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
the
cobbler
nearly
dropped
the
ticket
at
the
sight
of
him
hullo
cantercot
he
gasped
why
where
have
you
been
all
these
days
terribly
busy
said
denzil
here
give
me
a
glass
of
water
i
dry
as
the
sahara
crowl
ran
inside
and
got
the
water
trying
hard
not
to
inform
crowl
of
their
lodger
return
mother
had
expressed
herself
freely
on
the
subject
of
the
poet
during
his
absence
and
not
in
terms
which
would
have
commended
themselves
to
the
poet
fastidious
literary
sense
indeed
she
did
not
hesitate
to
call
him
a
sponger
and
a
low
swindler
who
had
run
away
to
avoid
paying
the
piper
her
fool
of
a
husband
might
be
quite
sure
he
would
never
set
eyes
on
the
scoundrel
again
however
crowl
was
wrong
here
was
denzil
back
again
and
yet
crowl
felt
no
sense
of
victory
he
had
no
desire
to
crow
over
his
partner
and
to
utter
that
see
did
i
tell
you
so
which
is
a
greater
consolation
than
religion
in
most
of
the
misfortunes
of
life
unfortunately
to
get
the
water
crowl
had
to
go
to
the
kitchen
and
as
he
was
usually
such
a
temperate
man
this
desire
for
drink
in
the
middle
of
the
day
attracted
the
attention
of
the
lady
in
possession
crowl
had
to
explain
the
situation
crowl
ran
into
the
shop
to
improve
it
crowl
followed
in
dismay
leaving
a
trail
of
spilled
water
in
his
wake
you
disreputable
scarecrow
where
have
hush
mother
let
him
drink
cantercot
is
thirsty
does
he
care
if
my
children
are
hungry
denzil
tossed
the
water
greedily
down
his
throat
almost
at
a
gulp
as
if
it
were
brandy
madam
he
said
smacking
his
lips
i
do
care
i
care
intensely
few
things
in
life
would
grieve
me
more
deeply
than
to
hear
that
a
child
a
dear
little
child
the
beautiful
in
a
nutshell
had
suffered
hunger
you
wrong
me
his
voice
was
tremulous
with
the
sense
of
injury
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
wrong
you
i
no
wish
to
wrong
you
said
crowl
i
should
like
to
hang
you
do
talk
of
such
ugly
things
said
denzil
touching
his
throat
nervously
well
what
have
you
been
doin
all
this
time
why
what
should
i
be
doing
how
should
i
know
what
became
of
you
i
thought
it
was
another
murder
what
denzil
glass
dashed
to
fragments
on
the
floor
what
do
you
mean
but
crowl
was
glaring
too
viciously
at
crowl
to
reply
he
understood
the
message
as
if
it
were
printed
it
ran
you
have
broken
one
of
my
best
glasses
you
have
annihilated
threepence
or
a
school
fees
for
half
the
family
peter
wished
she
would
turn
the
lightning
upon
denzil
a
conductor
down
whom
it
would
run
innocuously
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
pieces
as
carefully
as
if
they
were
cuttings
from
the
thus
the
lightning
passed
harmlessly
over
his
head
and
flew
toward
cantercot
what
do
i
mean
crowl
echoed
as
if
there
had
been
no
interval
i
mean
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
you
had
been
murdered
what
unbeautiful
ideas
you
have
to
be
sure
murmured
denzil
yes
but
they
be
useful
said
crowl
who
had
not
lived
with
peter
all
these
years
for
nothing
and
if
you
have
been
murdered
what
have
you
been
doing
my
dear
my
dear
put
in
crowl
deprecatingly
looking
up
from
his
quadrupedal
position
like
a
sad
dog
you
are
not
cantercot
keeper
oh
ai
i
flashed
his
spouse
who
else
keeps
him
i
should
like
to
know
peter
went
on
picking
up
the
pieces
of
the
i
have
no
secrets
from
crowl
denzil
explained
courteously
i
have
been
working
day
and
night
bringing
out
a
new
paper
have
had
a
wink
of
sleep
for
three
nights
peter
looked
up
at
his
bloodshot
eyes
with
respectful
interest
the
capitalist
met
me
in
the
street
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
was
overjoyed
at
the
and
told
him
the
idea
i
been
brooding
over
for
months
and
he
promised
to
stand
all
the
racket
what
sort
of
a
paper
said
peter
can
you
ask
to
what
do
you
think
i
been
devoting
my
days
and
nights
but
to
the
cultivation
of
the
beautiful
is
that
what
the
paper
will
be
devoted
to
yes
to
the
beautiful
i
know
snorted
crowl
with
portraits
of
actresses
portraits
oh
no
said
denzil
that
would
be
the
true
not
the
beautiful
and
what
the
name
of
the
paper
asked
crowl
ah
that
a
secret
peter
like
scott
i
prefer
to
remain
anonymous
just
like
your
fads
i
only
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
where
the
fun
of
anonymity
comes
in
if
i
had
any
gifts
i
should
like
to
get
the
credit
it
a
right
and
natural
feeling
to
my
thinking
unnatural
peter
unnatural
we
all
born
anonymous
and
i
for
sticking
close
to
nature
enough
for
me
that
i
disseminate
the
beautiful
any
letters
come
during
my
absence
mrs
crowl
no
she
snapped
but
a
gent
named
grodman
called
he
said
you
been
to
see
him
for
some
time
and
looked
annoyed
to
hear
disappeared
how
much
have
you
let
him
in
for
the
man
in
my
debt
said
denzil
annoyed
i
wrote
a
book
for
him
and
he
taken
all
the
credit
for
it
the
rogue
my
name
does
appear
even
in
the
preface
what
that
ticket
you
looking
so
lovingly
at
peter
that
for
the
unveiling
of
constant
portrait
gladstone
speaks
awful
demand
for
places
gladstone
sneered
denzil
who
wants
to
hear
gladstone
a
man
devoted
his
life
to
pulling
down
the
pillars
of
church
and
state
a
man
who
devoted
his
whole
life
to
propping
up
the
crumbling
fads
of
religion
and
monarchy
but
for
all
that
the
man
has
his
gifts
and
i
burnin
to
hear
him
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
an
inch
to
hear
him
said
denzil
and
went
up
to
his
room
and
when
crowl
sent
him
up
a
cup
of
nice
strong
tea
at
tea
time
the
brat
who
bore
it
found
him
lying
dressed
on
the
bed
snoring
unbeautifully
the
evening
wore
on
it
was
fine
frosty
weather
the
whitechapel
road
swarmed
with
noisy
life
as
though
it
were
a
saturday
night
the
stars
flared
in
the
sky
like
the
lights
of
celestial
costermongers
everybody
was
on
the
alert
for
the
advent
of
gladstone
he
must
surely
come
through
the
road
on
his
journey
from
the
west
but
nobody
saw
him
or
his
carriage
except
those
about
the
hall
probably
he
went
by
tram
most
of
the
way
he
would
have
caught
cold
in
an
open
carriage
or
bobbing
his
head
out
of
the
window
of
a
closed
if
he
had
only
been
a
german
prince
or
a
cannibal
king
said
crowl
bitterly
as
he
plodded
toward
the
club
we
should
have
disguised
mile
end
in
bunting
and
blue
fire
but
perhaps
it
a
compliment
he
knows
his
london
and
it
no
use
trying
to
hide
the
facts
from
him
they
must
have
queer
notions
of
cities
those
monarchs
they
must
fancy
everybody
lives
in
a
flutter
of
flags
and
walks
about
under
triumphal
arches
like
as
if
i
were
to
stitch
shoes
in
my
sunday
clothes
by
a
defiance
of
chronology
crowl
had
them
on
and
they
seemed
to
accentuate
the
simile
and
why
should
life
be
fuller
of
the
beautiful
said
denzil
the
poet
had
brushed
the
reluctant
mud
off
his
garments
to
the
extent
it
was
willing
to
go
and
had
washed
his
face
but
his
eyes
were
still
bloodshot
from
the
cultivation
of
the
beautiful
denzil
was
accompanying
crowl
to
the
door
of
the
club
out
of
denzil
was
himself
accompanied
by
grodman
though
less
obtrusively
least
obtrusively
was
he
accompanied
by
his
usual
scotland
yard
shadows
wimp
agents
there
was
a
surging
nondescript
crowd
about
the
club
and
the
police
and
the
and
the
stewards
could
with
difficulty
keep
out
the
tide
of
the
ticketless
through
which
the
current
of
the
privileged
had
equal
difficulty
in
permeating
the
streets
all
around
were
thronged
with
people
longing
for
a
glimpse
of
gladstone
mortlake
drove
up
in
a
hansom
his
head
a
pendulum
of
popularity
swaying
and
bowing
to
right
and
left
and
received
all
the
enthusiasm
well
cantercot
said
crowl
no
i
see
you
to
the
door
peter
they
fought
their
way
shoulder
to
shoulder
now
that
grodman
had
found
denzil
he
was
not
going
to
lose
him
again
he
had
only
found
him
by
accident
for
he
was
himself
bound
to
the
unveiling
ceremony
to
which
he
had
been
invited
in
view
of
his
known
devotion
to
the
task
of
unveiling
the
mystery
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
policemen
about
who
said
ay
ay
sir
and
he
was
prepared
to
follow
denzil
if
necessary
and
to
give
up
the
pleasure
of
hearing
gladstone
for
an
acuter
thrill
the
arrest
must
be
delayed
no
longer
but
denzil
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
in
on
the
heels
of
crowl
this
would
suit
grodman
better
he
could
then
have
the
two
pleasures
but
denzil
was
stopped
through
the
door
ticket
sir
denzil
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
press
he
said
majestically
all
the
glories
and
grandeurs
of
the
fourth
estate
were
concentrated
in
that
haughty
monosyllable
heaven
itself
is
full
of
journalists
who
have
overawed
peter
but
the
was
a
veritable
dragon
what
paper
sir
pork
herald
said
denzil
sharply
he
did
not
relish
his
word
being
distrusted
york
herald
said
one
of
the
bystanding
stewards
scarce
catching
the
sounds
pass
him
in
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
denzil
had
eagerly
slipped
inside
but
during
the
brief
altercation
wimp
had
come
up
even
he
could
not
make
his
face
quite
impassive
and
there
was
a
suppressed
intensity
in
the
eyes
and
a
quiver
about
the
mouth
he
went
in
on
denzil
heels
blocking
up
the
doorway
with
grodman
the
two
men
were
so
full
of
their
coming
that
they
struggled
for
some
seconds
side
by
side
before
they
recognized
each
other
then
they
shook
hands
heartily
that
was
cantercot
just
went
in
was
it
grodman
said
wimp
i
did
notice
said
grodman
in
tones
of
utter
indifference
at
bottom
wimp
was
terribly
excited
he
felt
that
his
was
going
to
be
executed
under
very
sensational
circumstances
everything
would
combine
to
turn
the
eyes
of
the
country
upon
him
nay
of
the
world
for
had
not
the
big
bow
mystery
been
discussed
in
every
language
under
the
sun
in
these
electric
times
the
criminal
achieves
a
cosmopolitan
reputation
it
is
a
privilege
he
shares
with
few
other
artists
this
time
wimp
would
be
one
of
them
and
he
felt
deservedly
so
if
the
criminal
had
been
cunning
to
the
point
of
genius
in
planning
the
murder
he
had
been
acute
to
the
point
of
divination
in
detecting
it
never
before
had
he
pieced
together
so
broken
a
chain
he
could
not
resist
the
unique
opportunity
of
setting
a
sensational
scheme
in
a
sensational
the
dramatic
instinct
was
strong
in
him
he
felt
like
a
playwright
who
has
constructed
a
strong
melodramatic
plot
and
has
the
drury
lane
stage
suddenly
offered
him
to
present
it
on
it
would
be
folly
to
deny
himself
the
luxury
though
the
presence
of
gladstone
and
the
nature
of
the
ceremony
should
perhaps
have
given
him
pause
yet
on
the
other
hand
these
were
the
very
factors
of
the
temptation
wimp
went
in
and
took
a
seat
behind
denzil
all
the
seats
were
numbered
so
that
everybody
might
have
the
satisfaction
of
occupying
somebody
else
denzil
was
in
the
special
reserved
places
in
the
front
row
just
by
the
central
gangway
crowl
was
squeezed
into
a
corner
behind
a
pillar
near
the
back
of
the
hall
grodman
had
been
honored
with
a
seat
on
the
platform
which
was
accessible
by
steps
on
the
right
and
left
but
he
kept
his
eye
on
denzil
the
picture
of
the
poor
idealist
hung
on
the
wall
behind
grodman
head
covered
by
its
curtain
of
brown
holland
there
was
a
subdued
buzz
of
excitement
about
the
hall
which
swelled
into
cheers
every
now
and
again
as
some
gentleman
known
to
fame
or
bow
took
his
place
upon
the
platform
it
was
occupied
by
several
local
of
varying
politics
a
number
of
other
parliamentary
satellites
of
the
great
man
three
or
four
labor
leaders
a
peer
or
two
of
philanthropic
pretensions
a
sprinkling
of
toynbee
and
oxford
hall
men
the
president
and
other
honorary
officials
some
of
the
family
and
friends
of
the
deceased
together
with
the
inevitable
percentage
of
persons
who
had
no
claim
to
be
there
save
cheek
gladstone
was
late
later
than
mortlake
who
was
cheered
to
the
echo
when
he
arrived
someone
starting
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
as
if
it
were
a
political
meeting
gladstone
came
in
just
in
time
to
acknowledge
the
compliment
the
noise
of
the
song
trolled
out
from
iron
lungs
had
drowned
the
huzzahs
heralding
the
old
man
advent
the
convivial
chorus
went
to
mortlake
head
as
if
champagne
had
really
preceded
it
his
eyes
grew
moist
and
dim
he
saw
himself
swimming
to
the
millenium
on
waves
of
enthusiasm
ah
how
his
should
be
rewarded
for
their
trust
in
him
with
his
usual
courtesy
and
consideration
gladstone
had
refused
to
perform
the
actual
unveiling
of
arthur
constant
portrait
that
he
said
in
his
postcard
will
fall
most
appropriately
to
mortlake
a
gentleman
who
has
i
am
given
to
understand
enjoyed
the
personal
friendship
of
the
late
mr
constant
and
has
with
him
in
various
schemes
for
the
organization
of
skilled
and
unskilled
classes
of
labor
as
well
as
for
the
diffusion
of
better
ideals
ideals
of
and
among
the
workingmen
of
bow
who
have
been
fortunate
so
far
as
i
can
perceive
in
the
possession
if
in
one
case
unhappily
only
temporary
possession
of
two
such
men
of
undoubted
ability
and
honesty
to
direct
their
divided
counsels
and
to
lead
them
along
a
road
which
though
i
can
not
pledge
myself
to
approve
of
it
in
all
its
turnings
and
windings
is
yet
not
unfitted
to
bring
them
somewhat
nearer
to
goals
to
which
there
are
few
of
us
but
would
extend
some
measure
of
hope
that
the
working
classes
of
this
great
empire
may
in
due
course
yet
with
no
unnecessary
delay
be
enabled
to
arrive
gladstone
speech
was
an
expansion
of
his
postcard
punctuated
by
cheers
the
only
new
thing
in
it
was
the
graceful
and
touching
way
in
which
he
revealed
what
had
been
a
secret
up
till
then
that
the
portrait
had
been
painted
and
presented
to
the
bow
break
o
day
club
by
lucy
brent
who
in
the
fulness
of
time
would
have
been
arthur
wife

was
a
painting
for
which
he
had
sat
to
her
while
alive
and
she
had
stifled
yet
pampered
her
grief
by
working
hard
at
it
since
his
death
the
fact
added
the
last
touch
of
pathos
to
the
occasion
face
was
hidden
behind
his
red
handkerchief
even
the
fire
of
excitement
in
wimp
eye
was
quenched
for
a
moment
by
a
as
he
thought
of
wimp
and
wilfred
as
for
grodman
there
was
almost
a
lump
in
his
throat
denzil
cantercot
was
the
only
unmoved
man
in
the
room
he
thought
the
episode
quite
too
beautiful
and
was
already
weaving
it
into
rhyme
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
gladstone
called
upon
tom
mortlake
to
unveil
the
portrait
tom
rose
pale
and
excited
his
hand
faltered
as
he
touched
the
cord
he
seemed
overcome
with
emotion
was
it
the
mention
of
lucy
brent
that
had
moved
him
to
his
depths
the
brown
holland
fell
away
the
dead
stood
revealed
as
he
had
been
in
life
every
feature
painted
by
the
hand
of
love
was
instinct
with
vitality
the
fine
earnest
face
the
sad
kindly
eyes
the
noble
brow
seeming
still
with
the
thought
of
humanity
a
thrill
ran
through
the
room
there
was
a
low
undefinable
murmur
o
the
pathos
and
the
tragedy
of
it
every
eye
was
fixed
misty
with
emotion
upon
the
dead
man
in
the
picture
and
the
living
man
who
stood
pale
and
agitated
and
visibly
unable
to
commence
his
speech
at
the
side
of
the
canvas
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
upon
the
labor
leader
shoulder
and
there
rang
through
the
hall
in
wimp
clear
decisive
tones
the
words
tom
mortlake
i
arrest
you
for
the
murder
of
arthur
constant
chapter
ix
for
a
moment
there
was
an
acute
terrible
silence
mortlake
face
was
that
of
a
corpse
the
face
of
the
dead
man
at
his
side
was
flushed
with
the
hues
of
life
to
the
overstrung
nerves
of
the
onlookers
the
brooding
eyes
of
the
picture
seemed
sad
and
stern
with
menace
and
charged
with
the
lightnings
of
doom
it
was
a
horrible
contrast
for
wimp
alone
the
painted
face
had
fuller
more
tragical
meanings
the
audience
seemed
turned
to
stone
they
sat
or
stood
in
every
variety
of
attitude
frozen
rigid
arthur
constant
picture
dominated
the
scene
the
only
living
thing
in
a
hall
of
the
dead
but
only
for
a
moment
mortlake
shook
off
the
detective
hand
boys
he
cried
in
accents
of
infinite
indignation
this
is
a
police
conspiracy
his
words
relaxed
the
tension
the
stony
figures
were
agitated
a
dull
excited
hubbub
answered
him
the
little
cobbler
darted
from
behind
his
pillar
and
leaped
upon
a
bench
the
cords
of
his
brow
were
swollen
with
excitement
he
seemed
a
giant
overshadowing
the
hall
boys
he
roared
in
his
best
victoria
park
voice
listen
to
me
this
charge
is
a
foul
and
damnable
lie
bravo
hear
hear
hooray
it
is
was
roared
back
at
him
from
all
parts
of
the
room
everybody
rose
and
stood
in
tentative
attitudes
excited
to
the
last
degree
boys
peter
roared
on
you
all
know
me
i
a
plain
man
and
i
want
to
know
if
it
likely
a
man
would
murder
his
best
friend
no
in
a
mighty
volume
of
sound
wimp
had
scarcely
calculated
upon
mortlake
popularity
he
stood
on
the
platform
pale
and
anxious
as
his
prisoner
and
if
he
did
why
did
they
prove
it
the
first
time
hear
hear
and
if
they
want
to
arrest
him
why
could
they
leave
it
till
the
ceremony
was
over
tom
mortlake
not
the
man
to
run
away
tom
mortlake
tom
mortlake
three
cheers
for
tom
mortlake
hip
hip
hip
hooray
three
groans
for
the
police
hoo
oo
oo
wimp
melodrama
was
not
going
well
he
felt
like
the
author
to
whose
ears
is
borne
the
ominous
sibilance
of
the
pit
he
almost
wished
he
had
not
followed
the
with
his
own
stronger
drama
unconsciously
the
police
scattered
about
the
hall
drew
together
the
people
on
the
platform
knew
not
what
to
do
they
had
all
risen
and
stood
in
a
mass
even
gladstone
speech
failed
him
in
circumstances
so
novel
the
groans
died
away
the
cheers
for
mortlake
rose
and
swelled
and
fell
and
rose
again
sticks
and
umbrellas
were
banged
and
rattled
handkerchiefs
were
waved
the
thunder
deepened
the
motley
crowd
still
surging
about
the
hall
took
up
the
cheers
and
for
hundreds
of
yards
around
people
were
going
black
in
the
face
out
of
mere
irresponsible
enthusiasm
at
last
tom
waved
his
hand
the
thunder
dwindled
died
the
prisoner
was
master
of
the
situation
grodman
stood
on
the
platform
grasping
the
back
of
his
chair
a
curious
mocking
mephistophelian
glitter
about
his
eyes
his
lips
wreathed
into
a
half
smile
there
was
no
hurry
for
him
to
get
denzil
cantercot
arrested
now
wimp
had
made
an
egregious
a
colossal
blunder
in
grodman
heart
there
was
a
great
glad
calm
as
of
a
man
who
has
strained
his
sinews
to
win
in
a
famous
match
and
has
heard
the
judge
word
he
felt
almost
kindly
to
denzil
now
tom
mortlake
spoke
his
face
was
set
and
stony
his
tall
figure
was
drawn
up
haughtily
to
its
full
height
he
pushed
the
black
mane
back
from
his
forehead
with
a
characteristic
gesture
the
fevered
audience
hung
upon
his
lips
the
men
at
the
back
leaned
eagerly
forward
the
reporters
were
breathless
with
fear
lest
they
should
miss
a
word
what
would
the
great
labor
leader
have
to
say
at
this
supreme
moment
chairman
and
gentlemen
it
is
to
me
a
melancholy
pleasure
to
have
been
honored
with
the
task
of
unveiling
this
portrait
of
a
great
benefactor
to
bow
and
a
true
friend
to
the
laboring
classes
except
that
he
honored
me
with
his
friendship
while
living
and
that
the
aspirations
of
my
life
have
in
my
small
and
restricted
way
been
identical
with
his
there
is
little
reason
why
this
honorable
duty
should
have
fallen
upon
me
gentlemen
i
trust
that
we
shall
all
find
an
inspiring
influence
in
the
daily
vision
of
the
dead
who
yet
liveth
in
our
hearts
and
in
this
noble
work
of
art
wrought
as
gladstone
has
told
us
by
the
hand
of
one
who
loved
him
the
speaker
paused
a
moment
his
low
vibrant
tones
faltering
into
silence
if
we
humble
workingmen
of
bow
can
never
hope
to
exert
individually
a
tithe
of
the
beneficial
influence
wielded
by
arthur
constant
it
is
yet
possible
for
each
of
us
to
walk
in
the
light
he
has
kindled
in
our
midst
a
perpetual
lamp
of
and
brotherhood
that
was
all
the
room
rang
with
cheers
tom
mortlake
resumed
his
seat
to
wimp
the
man
audacity
verged
on
the
sublime
to
denzil
on
the
beautiful
again
there
was
a
breathless
hush
gladstone
mobile
face
was
working
with
excitement
no
such
extraordinary
scene
had
occurred
in
the
whole
of
his
extraordinary
experience
he
seemed
about
to
rise
the
cheering
subsided
to
a
painful
stillness
wimp
cut
the
situation
by
laying
his
hand
again
upon
tom
shoulder
come
quietly
with
me
he
said
the
words
were
almost
a
whisper
but
in
the
supreme
silence
they
traveled
to
the
ends
of
the
hall
do
you
go
tom
the
trumpet
tones
were
peter
the
call
thrilled
an
answering
chord
of
defiance
in
every
breast
and
a
low
ominous
murmur
swept
through
the
hall
tom
rose
and
there
was
silence
again
boys
he
said
let
me
go
do
make
any
noise
about
it
i
shall
be
with
you
again
but
the
blood
of
the
break
o
day
boys
was
at
fever
heat
a
hurtling
mass
of
men
struggled
confusedly
from
their
seats
in
a
moment
all
was
chaos
tom
did
not
move
men
headed
by
peter
scaled
the
platform
wimp
was
thrown
to
one
side
and
the
invaders
formed
a
ring
round
tom
chair
the
platform
people
scampered
like
mice
from
the
center
some
huddled
together
in
the
corners
others
slipped
out
at
the
rear
the
committee
congratulated
themselves
on
having
had
the
to
exclude
ladies
gladstone
satellites
hurried
the
old
man
off
and
into
his
carriage
though
the
fight
promised
to
become
homeric
grodman
stood
at
the
side
of
the
platform
secretly
more
amused
than
ever
concerning
himself
no
more
with
denzil
cantercot
who
was
already
strengthening
his
nerves
at
the
bar
upstairs
the
police
about
the
hall
blew
their
whistles
and
policemen
came
rushing
in
from
outside
and
the
neighborhood
an
irish
on
the
platform
was
waving
his
gingham
like
a
shillalah
in
sheer
excitement
forgetting
his
respectability
and
dreaming
himself
back
at
donnybrook
fair
him
a
conscientious
constable
floored
with
a
truncheon
but
a
shower
of
fists
fell
on
the
zealot
face
and
he
tottered
back
bleeding
then
the
storm
broke
in
all
its
fury
the
upper
air
was
black
with
staves
sticks
and
umbrellas
mingled
with
the
pallid
hailstones
of
knobby
fists
yells
and
groans
and
hoots
and
blent
in
grotesque
chorus
like
one
of
dvor√°k
weird
diabolical
movements
mortlake
stood
impassive
with
arms
folded
making
no
further
effort
and
the
battle
raged
round
him
as
the
water
swirls
around
some
steadfast
rock
a
posse
of
police
from
the
back
fought
their
way
steadily
toward
him
and
charged
up
the
heights
of
the
platform
steps
only
to
be
sent
tumbling
backward
as
their
leader
was
hurled
at
them
like
a
battering
ram
upon
the
top
of
the
heap
fell
he
surmounting
the
strata
of
policemen
but
others
clambered
upon
them
escalading
the
platform
a
moment
more
and
mortlake
would
have
been
taken
after
being
well
shaken
then
the
miracle
happened
as
when
of
old
a
reputable
goddess
saw
her
favorite
hero
in
dire
peril
straightway
she
drew
down
a
cloud
from
the
celestial
stores
of
jupiter
and
enveloped
her
fondling
in
kindly
night
so
that
his
adversary
strove
with
the
darkness
so
did
crowl
the
cunning
cobbler
the
essay
to
insure
his
friend
safety
he
turned
off
the
gas
at
the
meter
an
arctic
night
unpreceded
by
twilight
fell
and
there
dawned
the
sabbath
of
the
witches
the
darkness
could
be
felt
and
it
left
blood
and
bruises
behind
it
when
the
lights
were
turned
on
again
mortlake
was
gone
but
several
of
the
rioters
were
arrested
triumphantly
and
through
all
and
over
all
the
face
of
the
dead
man
who
had
sought
to
bring
peace
on
earth
brooded
crowl
sat
meekly
eating
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
with
his
head
bandaged
while
denzil
cantercot
told
him
the
story
of
how
he
had
rescued
tom
mortlake
he
had
been
among
the
first
to
scale
the
height
and
had
never
budged
from
tom
side
or
from
the
forefront
of
the
battle
till
he
had
seen
him
safely
outside
and
into
a
illustration
crowl
sat
meekly
eating
his
supper
of
bread
and
cheese
i
am
so
glad
you
saw
that
he
got
away
safely
said
crowl
i
quite
sure
he
would
yes
but
i
wish
some
cowardly
fool
had
turned
off
the
gas
i
like
men
to
see
that
they
are
beaten
but
it
seemed
easier
faltered
crowl
easier
echoed
denzil
taking
a
deep
draught
of
bitter
really
peter
i
sorry
to
find
you
always
will
take
such
low
views
it
may
be
easier
but
it
shabby
it
shocks
one
sense
of
the
beautiful
crowl
ate
his
bread
and
cheese
but
what
was
the
use
of
breaking
your
head
to
save
him
said
crowl
with
an
unconscious
pun
he
must
be
caught
ah
i
do
see
how
the
useful
does
come
in
now
said
peter
thoughtfully
but
i
did
think
of
that
at
the
time
he
swallowed
his
water
quickly
and
it
went
the
wrong
way
and
added
to
his
confusion
it
also
began
to
dawn
upon
him
that
he
might
be
called
to
account
let
it
be
said
at
once
that
he
was
he
had
taken
too
prominent
a
part
meantime
wimp
was
bathing
wimp
eye
and
rubbing
him
generally
with
arnica
wimp
melodrama
had
been
indeed
a
sight
for
the
gods
only
virtue
was
vanquished
and
vice
triumphant
the
villain
had
escaped
and
without
striking
a
blow
chapter
x
there
was
matter
and
to
spare
for
the
papers
the
next
day
the
striking
ceremony
gladstone
speech
the
sensational
arrest
these
would
of
themselves
have
made
excellent
themes
for
reports
and
leaders
but
the
personality
of
the
man
arrested
and
the
big
bow
mystery
battle
as
it
came
to
be
called
gave
additional
piquancy
to
the
paragraphs
and
the
posters
the
behavior
of
mortlake
put
the
last
touch
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
position
he
left
the
hall
when
the
lights
went
out
and
walked
unnoticed
and
unmolested
through
pleiads
of
policemen
to
the
nearest
police
station
where
the
superintendent
was
almost
too
excited
to
take
any
notice
of
his
demand
to
be
arrested
but
to
do
him
justice
the
official
yielded
as
soon
as
he
understood
the
situation
it
seems
inconceivable
that
he
did
not
violate
some
regulation
in
so
doing
to
some
this
was
limpid
proof
of
innocence
to
others
it
was
the
damning
token
of
despairing
guilt
the
morning
papers
were
pleasant
reading
for
grodman
who
chuckled
as
continuously
over
his
morning
egg
as
if
he
had
laid
it
jane
was
alarmed
for
the
sanity
of
her
saturnine
master
as
her
husband
would
have
said
grodman
grins
were
not
beautiful
but
he
made
no
effort
to
suppress
them
not
only
had
wimp
perpetrated
a
grotesque
blunder
but
the
journalists
to
a
man
were
down
on
his
great
sensation
tableau
though
their
denunciations
did
not
appear
in
the
dramatic
columns
the
liberal
papers
said
that
he
had
endangered
gladstone
life
the
conservative
that
he
had
unloosed
the
raging
elements
of
bow
blackguardism
and
set
in
motion
forces
which
might
have
easily
swelled
to
a
riot
involving
severe
destruction
of
property
but
tom
mortlake
was
after
all
the
thought
swamping
every
other
it
was
in
a
sense
a
triumph
for
the
man
but
wimp
turn
came
when
mortlake
who
reserved
his
defense
was
brought
up
before
a
magistrate
and
by
force
of
the
new
evidence
fully
committed
for
trial
on
the
charge
of
murdering
arthur
constant
then
men
thoughts
centered
again
on
the
mystery
and
the
solution
of
the
inexplicable
problem
agitated
mankind
from
china
to
peru
in
the
middle
of
february
the
great
trial
befell
it
was
another
of
the
opportunities
which
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
neglects
so
stirring
a
drama
might
have
easily
cleared
its
expenses
despite
the
length
of
the
cast
the
salaries
of
the
stars
and
the
rent
of
the
house
in
mere
advance
booking
for
it
was
a
drama
which
by
the
rights
of
magna
charta
could
never
be
repeated
a
drama
which
ladies
of
fashion
would
have
given
their
earrings
to
witness
even
with
the
central
figure
not
a
woman
and
there
was
a
woman
in
it
anyhow
to
judge
by
the
little
that
had
transpired
at
the
magisterial
examination
and
the
fact
that
the
country
was
placarded
with
bills
offering
a
reward
for
information
concerning
a
miss
jessie
dymond
mortlake
was
defended
by
sir
charles
retained
at
the
expense
of
the
mortlake
defense
fund
subscriptions
to
which
came
also
from
australia
and
the
continent
and
set
on
his
mettle
by
the
fact
that
he
was
the
accepted
labor
candidate
for
an
constituency
their
majesties
victoria
and
the
law
were
represented
by
robert
spigot
mr
spigot
in
presenting
his
case
said
i
propose
to
show
that
the
prisoner
murdered
his
friend
and
arthur
constant
in
cold
blood
and
with
the
most
careful
premeditation
premeditation
so
studied
as
to
leave
the
circumstances
of
the
death
an
impenetrable
mystery
for
weeks
to
all
the
world
though
fortunately
without
altogether
baffling
the
almost
superhuman
ingenuity
of
edward
wimp
of
the
scotland
yard
detective
department
i
propose
to
show
that
the
motives
of
the
prisoner
were
jealousy
and
revenge
jealousy
not
only
of
his
friend
superior
influence
over
the
workingmen
he
himself
aspired
to
lead
but
the
more
commonplace
animosity
engendered
by
the
disturbing
element
of
a
woman
having
relations
to
both
if
before
my
case
is
complete
it
will
be
my
painful
duty
to
show
that
the
murdered
man
was
not
the
saint
the
world
has
agreed
to
paint
him
i
shall
not
shrink
from
unveiling
the
truer
picture
in
the
interests
of
justice
which
can
not
say
nisi
even
of
the
dead
i
propose
to
show
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
the
prisoner
shortly
before
six
on
the
morning
of
december
and
that
the
prisoner
having
with
the
remarkable
ingenuity
which
he
has
shown
throughout
attempted
to
prepare
an
alibi
by
feigning
to
leave
london
by
the
first
train
to
liverpool
returned
home
got
in
with
his
through
the
which
he
had
left
on
the
latch
unlocked
his
victim
bedroom
with
a
key
which
he
possessed
cut
the
sleeping
man
throat
pocketed
his
razor
locked
the
door
again
and
gave
it
the
appearance
of
being
bolted
went
downstairs
unslipped
the
bolt
of
the
big
lock
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
got
to
euston
in
time
for
the
second
train
to
liverpool
the
fog
helped
his
proceedings
throughout
such
was
in
sum
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
the
pale
defiant
figure
in
the
dock
winced
perceptibly
under
parts
of
it
drabdump
was
the
first
witness
called
for
the
prosecution
she
was
quite
used
to
legal
inquisitiveness
by
this
time
but
did
not
appear
in
good
spirits
on
the
night
of
december
you
gave
the
prisoner
a
letter
yes
your
ludship
how
did
he
behave
when
he
read
it
he
turned
very
pale
and
excited
he
went
up
to
the
poor
room
and
i
afraid
he
quarreled
with
him
he
might
have
left
his
last
hours
peaceful
amusement
what
happened
then
mortlake
went
out
in
a
passion
and
came
in
again
in
about
an
hour
he
told
you
he
was
going
away
to
liverpool
very
early
the
next
morning
no
your
ludship
he
said
he
was
going
to
devonport
sensation
what
time
did
you
get
up
the
next
morning
six
that
is
not
your
usual
time
no
i
always
get
up
at
six
how
do
you
account
for
the
extra
sleepiness
misfortunes
will
happen
it
was
the
dull
foggy
weather
no
my
lud
else
i
should
never
get
up
early
laughter
you
drink
something
before
going
to
bed
i
like
my
cup
o
tea
i
take
it
strong
without
sugar
it
always
steadies
my
nerves
quite
so
where
were
you
when
the
prisoner
told
you
he
was
going
to
devonport
drinkin
my
tea
in
the
kitchen
what
should
you
say
if
prisoner
dropped
something
in
it
to
make
you
sleep
late
witness
startled
he
ought
to
be
shot
he
might
have
done
it
without
your
noticing
it
i
suppose
if
he
was
clever
enough
to
murder
the
poor
gentleman
he
was
clever
enough
to
try
and
poison
me
the
judge
the
witness
in
her
replies
must
confine
herself
to
the
evidence
mr
spigot
i
must
submit
to
your
lordship
that
it
is
a
very
logical
answer
and
exactly
illustrates
the
interdependence
of
the
probabilities
now
drabdump
let
us
know
what
happened
when
you
awoke
at
six
the
next
morning
thereupon
drabdump
recapitulated
the
evidence
with
new
redundancies
but
slight
variations
given
by
her
at
the
inquest
how
she
became
alarmed
how
she
found
the
locked
by
the
big
lock
how
she
roused
grodman
and
got
him
to
burst
open
the
door
how
they
found
the
body
all
this
with
which
the
public
was
already
familiar
was
extorted
from
her
afresh
look
at
this
key
key
passed
to
the
witness
do
you
recognize
it
yes
how
did
you
get
it
it
the
key
of
my
front
i
am
sure
i
left
it
sticking
in
the
door
did
you
know
a
miss
dymond
yes
mortlake
sweetheart
but
i
knew
he
would
never
marry
her
poor
thing
sensation
why
not
he
was
getting
too
grand
for
her
amusement
you
do
mean
anything
more
than
that
i
do
know
she
only
came
to
my
place
once
or
twice
the
last
time
i
set
eyes
on
her
must
have
been
in
october
how
did
she
appear
she
was
very
miserable
but
she
would
let
you
see
it
laughter
how
has
the
prisoner
behaved
since
the
murder
he
always
seemed
very
glum
and
sorry
for
it
did
not
the
prisoner
once
occupy
the
bedroom
of
mr
constant
and
give
it
up
to
him
so
that
mr
constant
might
have
the
two
rooms
on
the
same
floor
yes
but
he
did
pay
as
much
and
while
occupying
this
front
bedroom
did
not
the
prisoner
once
lose
his
key
and
have
another
made
he
did
he
was
very
careless
do
you
know
what
the
prisoner
and
mr
constant
spoke
about
on
the
night
of
december
no
i
could
hear
then
how
did
you
know
they
were
quarreling
they
were
talkin
so
loud
sir
charles
sharply
but
i
talking
loudly
to
you
now
should
you
say
i
was
quarreling
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
laughter
was
the
prisoner
the
sort
of
man
who
in
your
opinion
would
commit
a
murder
no
i
never
should
ha
guessed
it
was
him
he
always
struck
you
as
a
thorough
gentleman
no
my
lud
i
knew
he
was
only
a
comp
you
say
the
prisoner
has
seemed
depressed
since
the
murder
might
not
that
have
been
due
to
the
disappearance
of
his
sweetheart
no
he
more
likely
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
then
he
would
be
jealous
if
mr
constant
took
her
off
his
hands
sensation
men
are
never
mind
about
men
drabdump
had
the
prisoner
ceased
to
care
for
miss
dymond
he
did
seem
to
think
of
her
my
lud
when
he
got
a
letter
in
her
handwriting
among
his
heap
he
used
to
throw
it
aside
till
he
torn
open
the
others
with
a
triumphant
ring
in
his
voice
thank
you
drabdump
you
may
sit
down
spigot
one
moment
drabdump
you
say
the
prisoner
had
ceased
to
care
for
miss
dymond
might
not
this
have
been
in
consequence
of
his
suspecting
for
some
time
that
she
had
relations
with
mr
constant
the
judge
that
is
not
a
fair
question
spigot
that
will
do
thank
you
mrs
drabdump
no
one
question
more
drabdump
did
you
ever
see
anything
say
when
miss
dymond
came
to
your
house
to
make
you
suspect
anything
between
mr
constant
and
the
prisoner
sweetheart
she
did
meet
him
once
when
mortlake
was
out
sensation
where
did
she
meet
him
in
the
passage
he
was
going
out
when
she
knocked
and
he
opened
the
door
amusement
you
did
hear
what
they
said
i
ai
a
eavesdropper
they
spoke
friendly
and
went
away
together
george
grodman
was
called
and
repeated
his
evidence
at
the
inquest
he
testified
to
the
warm
friendship
between
mr
constant
and
the
prisoner
he
knew
very
little
about
miss
dymond
having
scarcely
seen
her
prisoner
had
never
spoken
to
him
much
about
her
he
should
not
think
she
was
much
in
prisoner
thoughts
naturally
the
prisoner
had
been
depressed
by
the
death
of
his
friend
besides
he
was
overworked
witness
thought
highly
of
mortlake
character
it
was
incredible
that
constant
had
had
improper
relations
of
any
kind
with
his
promised
wife
grodman
evidence
made
a
very
favorable
impression
on
the
jury
the
prisoner
looked
his
gratitude
and
the
prosecution
felt
sorry
it
had
been
necessary
to
call
this
witness
inspector
howlett
and
sergeant
runnymede
had
also
to
repeat
their
evidence
robinson
likewise
retendered
his
evidence
as
to
the
nature
of
the
wound
and
the
approximate
hour
of
death
but
this
time
he
was
much
more
severely
examined
he
would
not
bind
himself
down
to
state
the
time
within
an
hour
or
two
he
thought
life
had
been
extinct
two
or
three
hours
when
he
arrived
so
that
the
deed
had
been
committed
between
seven
and
eight
under
gentle
pressure
from
the
prosecuting
counsel
he
admitted
that
it
might
possibly
have
been
between
six
and
seven
he
reiterated
his
impression
in
favor
of
the
later
hour
supplementary
evidence
from
medical
experts
proved
as
dubious
and
uncertain
as
if
the
court
had
confined
itself
to
the
original
witness
it
seemed
to
be
generally
agreed
that
the
data
for
determining
the
time
of
death
of
anybody
were
too
complex
and
variable
to
admit
of
very
precise
inference
and
other
symptoms
setting
in
within
very
wide
limits
and
differing
largely
in
different
persons
all
agreed
that
death
from
such
a
cut
must
have
been
practically
instantaneous
and
the
theory
of
suicide
was
rejected
by
all
as
a
whole
the
medical
evidence
tended
to
fix
the
time
of
death
with
a
high
degree
of
probability
between
the
hours
of
six
and
eight
the
efforts
of
the
prosecution
were
bent
upon
throwing
back
the
time
of
death
to
as
early
as
possible
after
about
five
the
defense
spent
all
its
strength
upon
pinning
the
experts
to
the
conclusion
that
death
could
not
have
been
earlier
than
seven
evidently
the
prosecution
was
going
to
fight
hard
for
the
hypothesis
that
mortlake
had
committed
the
crime
in
the
interval
between
the
first
and
second
trains
for
liverpool
while
the
defense
was
concentrating
itself
on
an
alibi
showing
that
the
prisoner
had
traveled
by
the
second
train
which
left
euston
station
at
a
seven
so
that
there
could
have
been
no
possible
time
for
the
passage
between
bow
and
euston
it
was
an
exciting
struggle
as
yet
the
contending
forces
seemed
equally
matched
the
evidence
had
gone
as
much
for
as
against
the
prisoner
but
everybody
knew
that
worse
lay
behind
call
edward
wimp
the
story
edward
wimp
had
to
tell
began
tamely
enough
with
facts
but
at
last
the
new
facts
came
in
consequence
of
suspicions
that
had
formed
in
your
mind
you
took
up
your
quarters
disguised
in
the
late
mr
constant
rooms
i
did
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
my
suspicions
had
gradually
gathered
against
the
occupants
of
no
glover
street
and
i
resolved
to
quash
or
confirm
these
suspicions
once
for
all
will
you
tell
the
jury
what
followed
whenever
the
prisoner
was
away
for
the
night
i
searched
his
room
i
found
the
key
of
mr
constant
bedroom
buried
deeply
in
the
side
of
prisoner
leather
sofa
i
found
what
i
imagine
to
be
the
letter
he
received
on
december
in
the
pages
of
a
lying
under
the
same
sofa
there
were
two
razors
about
mr
spigot
said
the
key
has
already
been
identified
by
drabdump
the
letter
i
now
propose
to
read
it
was
undated
and
ran
as
follows
dear
tom
this
is
to
bid
you
farewell
it
is
the
best
for
us
all
i
am
going
a
long
way
dearest
do
not
seek
to
find
me
for
it
will
be
useless
think
of
me
as
one
swallowed
up
by
the
waters
and
be
assured
that
it
is
only
to
spare
you
shame
and
humiliation
in
the
future
that
i
tear
myself
from
you
and
all
the
sweetness
of
life
darling
there
is
no
other
way
i
feel
you
could
never
marry
me
now
i
have
felt
it
for
months
dear
tom
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
we
must
look
facts
in
the
face
i
hope
you
will
always
be
friends
with
mr
constant
good
by
dear
god
bless
you
may
you
always
be
happy
and
find
a
worthier
wife
than
i
perhaps
when
you
are
great
and
rich
and
famous
as
you
deserve
you
will
sometimes
think
not
unkindly
of
one
who
however
faulty
and
unworthy
of
you
will
at
least
love
you
till
the
end
yours
till
death
jessie
by
the
time
this
letter
was
finished
numerous
old
gentlemen
with
wigs
or
without
were
observed
to
be
polishing
their
glasses
examination
was
resumed
after
making
these
discoveries
what
did
you
do
i
made
inquiries
about
miss
dymond
and
found
mr
constant
had
visited
her
once
or
twice
in
the
evening
i
imagined
there
would
be
some
traces
of
a
pecuniary
connection
i
was
allowed
by
the
family
to
inspect
mr
constant
and
found
a
paid
check
made
out
for
in
the
name
of
miss
dymond
by
inquiry
at
the
bank
i
found
it
had
been
cashed
on
november
of
last
year
i
then
applied
for
a
warrant
against
the
prisoner
do
you
suggest
that
the
prisoner
opened
mr
bedroom
with
the
key
you
found
certainly
sarcastically
and
locked
the
door
from
within
with
it
on
leaving
certainly
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
explain
how
the
trick
was
done
it
was
done
laughter
the
prisoner
probably
locked
the
door
from
the
outside
those
who
broke
it
open
naturally
imagined
it
had
been
locked
from
the
inside
when
they
found
the
key
inside
the
key
would
on
this
theory
be
on
the
floor
as
the
outside
locking
could
not
have
been
effected
if
it
had
been
in
the
lock
the
first
persons
to
enter
the
room
would
naturally
believe
it
had
been
thrown
down
in
the
bursting
of
the
door
or
it
might
have
been
left
sticking
very
loosely
inside
the
lock
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
turning
of
the
outside
key
in
which
case
it
would
also
probably
have
been
thrown
to
the
ground
indeed
very
ingenious
and
can
you
also
explain
how
the
prisoner
could
have
bolted
the
door
within
from
the
outside
i
can
renewed
sensation
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
it
was
possible
and
that
was
of
course
a
mere
conjurer
illusion
to
cause
a
locked
door
to
appear
bolted
in
addition
it
would
only
be
necessary
for
the
person
on
the
inside
of
the
door
to
wrest
the
staple
containing
the
bolt
from
the
woodwork
the
bolt
in
mr
constant
bedroom
worked
perpendicularly
when
the
staple
was
torn
off
it
would
simply
remain
at
rest
on
the
pin
of
the
bolt
instead
of
supporting
it
or
keeping
it
fixed
a
person
bursting
open
the
door
and
finding
the
staple
resting
on
the
pin
and
torn
away
from
the
lintel
of
the
door
would
of
course
imagine
he
had
torn
it
away
never
dreaming
the
wresting
off
had
been
done
beforehand
applause
in
court
which
was
instantly
checked
by
the
ushers
the
counsel
for
the
defense
felt
he
had
been
entrapped
in
attempting
to
be
sarcastic
with
the
redoubtable
detective
grodman
seemed
green
with
envy
it
was
the
one
thing
he
had
not
thought
of
drabdump
grodman
inspector
howlett
and
sergeant
runnymede
were
recalled
and
by
the
embarrassed
sir
charles
as
to
the
exact
condition
of
the
lock
and
the
bolt
and
the
position
of
the
key
it
turned
out
as
wimp
had
suggested
so
prepossessed
were
the
witnesses
with
the
conviction
that
the
door
was
locked
and
bolted
from
the
inside
when
it
was
burst
open
that
they
were
a
little
hazy
about
the
exact
details
the
damage
had
been
repaired
so
that
it
was
all
a
question
of
precise
past
observation
the
inspector
and
the
sergeant
testified
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock
when
they
saw
it
though
both
the
mortise
and
the
bolt
were
broken
they
were
not
prepared
to
say
that
wimp
theory
was
impossible
they
would
even
admit
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
staple
of
the
bolt
had
been
torn
off
beforehand
drabdump
could
give
no
clear
account
of
such
petty
facts
in
view
of
her
immediate
engrossing
interest
in
the
horrible
sight
of
the
corpse
grodman
alone
was
positive
that
the
key
was
in
the
door
when
he
burst
it
open
no
he
did
not
remember
picking
it
up
from
the
floor
and
putting
it
in
and
he
was
certain
that
the
staple
of
the
bolt
was
not
broken
from
the
resistance
he
experienced
in
trying
to
shake
the
upper
panels
of
the
door
by
the
prosecution
do
you
think
from
the
comparative
ease
with
which
the
door
yielded
to
your
onslaught
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
pin
of
the
bolt
was
not
in
a
firmly
fixed
staple
but
in
one
already
detached
from
the
woodwork
of
the
lintel

easily
but
you
must
be

hercules
not
quite
the
bolt
was
old
and
the

crumbling

but
i
have
always
been

well

will
never

at
the
laughter
jessie
dymond
landlady
was
the
next
witness
for
the
prosecution
she
corroborated
wimp
statements
as
to
constant
occasional
visits
and
narrated
how
the
girl
had
been
enlisted
by
the
dead
philanthropist
as
a
collaborator
in
some
of
his
enterprises
but
the
most
telling
portion
of
her
evidence
was
the
story
of
how
late
at
night
on
december
the
prisoner
called
upon
her
and
inquired
wildly
about
the
whereabouts
of
his
sweetheart
he
said
he
had
just
received
a
mysterious
letter
from
miss
dymond
saying
she
was
gone
she
the
landlady
replied
that
she
could
have
told
him
that
weeks
ago
as
her
ungrateful
lodger
was
gone
now
some
three
weeks
without
leaving
a
hint
behind
her
in
answer
to
his
most
ungentlemanly
raging
and
raving
she
told
him
it
served
him
right
as
he
should
have
looked
after
her
better
and
not
kept
away
for
so
long
she
reminded
him
that
there
were
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
and
a
girl
of
jessie
attractions
need
not
pine
away
as
she
had
seemed
to
be
pining
away
for
lack
of
appreciation
he
then
called
her
a
liar
and
left
her
and
she
hoped
never
to
see
his
face
again
though
she
was
not
surprised
to
see
it
in
the
dock
fitzjames
montgomery
a
bank
clerk
remembered
cashing
the
check
produced
he
particularly
remembered
it
because
he
paid
the
money
to
a
very
pretty
girl
she
took
the
entire
amount
in
gold
at
this
point
the
case
was
adjourned
denzil
cantercot
was
the
first
witness
called
for
the
prosecution
on
the
resumption
of
the
trial
pressed
as
to
whether
he
had
not
told
wimp
that
he
had
overheard
the
prisoner
denouncing
mr
constant
he
could
not
say
he
had
not
actually
heard
the
prisoner
denunciations
he
might
have
given
wimp
a
false
impression
but
then
wimp
was
so
prosaically
literal
laughter
crowl
had
told
him
something
of
the
kind
he
said
jessie
dymond
was
a
rare
spirit
and
she
always
reminded
him
of
joan
of
arc
crowl
being
called
was
extremely
agitated
he
refused
to
take
the
oath
and
informed
the
court
that
the
bible
was
a
fad
he
could
not
swear
by
anything
so
he
would
affirm
he
could
not
deny
though
he
looked
like
wishing
to
that
the
prisoner
had
at
first
been
rather
mistrustful
of
mr
constant
but
he
was
certain
that
the
feeling
had
quickly
worn
off
yes
he
was
a
great
friend
of
the
prisoner
but
he
did
see
why
that
should
invalidate
his
testimony
especially
as
he
had
not
taken
an
oath
certainly
the
prisoner
seemed
rather
depressed
when
he
saw
him
on
bank
holiday
but
it
was
overwork
on
behalf
of
the
people
and
for
the
demolition
of
the
fads
several
other
familiars
of
the
prisoner
gave
more
or
less
reluctant
testimony
as
to
his
sometime
prejudice
against
the
amateur
rival
labor
leader
his
expressions
of
dislike
had
been
strong
and
bitter
the
prosecution
also
produced
a
poster
announcing
that
the
prisoner
would
preside
at
a
great
meeting
of
clerks
on
december
he
had
not
turned
up
at
this
meeting
nor
sent
any
explanation
finally
there
was
the
evidence
of
the
detectives
who
originally
arrested
him
at
liverpool
docks
in
view
of
his
suspicious
demeanor
this
completed
the
case
for
the
prosecution
sir
charles
rose
with
a
swagger
and
a
rustle
of
his
silk
gown
and
proceeded
to
set
forth
the
theory
of
the
defense
he
said
he
did
not
purpose
to
call
any
witnesses
the
hypothesis
of
the
prosecution
was
so
inherently
childish
and
inconsequential
and
so
dependent
upon
a
bundle
of
interdependent
probabilities
that
it
crumbled
away
at
the
merest
touch
the
prisoner
character
was
of
unblemished
integrity
his
last
public
appearance
had
been
made
on
the
same
platform
with
gladstone
and
his
honesty
and
highmindedness
had
been
vouched
for
by
statesmen
of
the
highest
standing
his
movements
could
be
accounted
for
from
hour
to
hour
and
those
with
which
the
prosecution
credited
him
rested
on
no
tangible
evidence
whatever
he
was
also
credited
with
superhuman
ingenuity
and
diabolical
cunning
of
which
he
had
shown
no
previous
symptom
hypothesis
was
piled
on
hypothesis
as
in
the
old
oriental
legend
where
the
world
rested
on
the
elephant
and
the
elephant
on
the
tortoise
it
might
be
worth
while
however
to
point
out
that
it
was
at
least
quite
likely
that
the
death
of
mr
constant
had
not
taken
place
before
seven
and
as
the
prisoner
left
euston
station
at
for
liverpool
he
could
certainly
not
have
got
there
from
bow
in
the
time
also
that
it
was
hardly
possible
for
the
prisoner
who
could
prove
being
at
euston
station
at
to
travel
backward
and
forward
to
glover
street
and
commit
the
crime
all
within
less
than
two
hours
the
real
facts
said
sir
charles
impressively
are
most
simple
the
prisoner
partly
from
pressure
of
work
partly
he
had
no
wish
to
conceal
from
worldly
ambition
had
begun
to
neglect
miss
dymond
to
whom
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
the
man
was
but
human
and
his
head
was
a
little
turned
by
his
growing
importance
nevertheless
at
heart
he
was
still
deeply
attached
to
miss
dymond
she
however
appears
to
have
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
ceased
to
love
her
that
she
was
unworthy
of
him
unfitted
by
education
to
take
her
place
side
by
side
with
him
in
the
new
spheres
to
which
he
was
mounting
that
in
short
she
was
a
drag
on
his
career
being
by
all
accounts
a
girl
of
remarkable
force
of
character
she
resolved
to
cut
the
gordian
knot
by
leaving
london
and
fearing
lest
her
affianced
conscientiousness
should
induce
him
to
sacrifice
himself
to
her
dreading
also
perhaps
her
own
weakness
she
made
the
parting
absolute
and
the
place
of
her
refuge
a
mystery
a
theory
has
been
suggested
which
drags
an
honored
name
in
the
mire
a
theory
so
superfluous
that
i
shall
only
allude
to
it
that
arthur
constant
could
have
seduced
or
had
any
improper
relations
with
his
friend
betrothed
is
a
hypothesis
to
which
the
lives
of
both
give
the
lie
before
leaving
london
or
england
miss
dymond
wrote
to
her
aunt
in
devonport
her
only
living
relative
in
this
country
asking
her
as
a
great
favor
to
forward
an
addressed
letter
to
the
prisoner
a
fortnight
after
receipt
the
aunt
obeyed
implicitly
this
was
the
letter
which
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
the
prisoner
on
the
night
of
december
all
his
old
love
returned
he
was
full
of
and
pity
for
the
poor
girl
the
letter
read
ominously
perhaps
she
was
going
to
put
an
end
to
herself
his
first
thought
was
to
rush
up
to
his
friend
constant
to
seek
his
advice
perhaps
constant
knew
something
of
the
affair
the
prisoner
knew
the
two
were
in
not
infrequent
communication
it
is
possible
my
lord
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
do
not
wish
to
follow
the
methods
of
the
prosecution
and
confuse
theory
with
fact
so
i
say
it
is
possible
that
mr
constant
had
supplied
her
with
the
to
leave
the
country
he
was
like
a
brother
to
her
perhaps
even
acted
imprudently
in
calling
upon
her
though
neither
dreamed
of
evil
it
is
possible
that
he
may
have
encouraged
her
in
her
abnegation
and
in
her
altruistic
aspirations
perhaps
even
without
knowing
their
exact
drift
for
does
he
not
speak
in
his
very
last
letter
of
the
fine
female
characters
he
was
meeting
and
the
influence
for
good
he
had
over
individual
human
souls
still
this
we
can
now
never
know
unless
the
dead
speak
or
the
absent
return
it
is
also
not
impossible
that
miss
dymond
was
entrusted
with
the
for
charitable
purposes
but
to
come
back
to
certainties
the
prisoner
consulted
mr
constant
about
the
letter
he
then
ran
to
miss
dymond
lodgings
in
stepney
green
knowing
beforehand
his
trouble
would
be
futile
the
letter
bore
the
postmark
of
devonport
he
knew
the
girl
had
an
aunt
there
possibly
she
might
have
gone
to
her
he
could
not
telegraph
for
he
was
ignorant
of
the
address
he
consulted
his
and
resolved
to
leave
by
the
from
paddington
and
told
his
landlady
so
he
left
the
letter
in
the
which
ultimately
got
thrust
among
a
pile
of
papers
under
the
sofa
so
that
he
had
to
get
another
he
was
careless
and
disorderly
and
the
key
found
by
wimp
in
his
sofa
must
have
lain
there
for
some
years
having
been
lost
there
in
the
days
when
he
occupied
the
bedroom
afterward
rented
by
mr
constant
afraid
to
miss
his
train
he
did
not
undress
on
that
distressful
night
meantime
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
jessie
was
too
clever
a
girl
to
leave
so
easy
a
trail
and
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
she
would
be
going
to
her
married
brother
in
america
and
had
gone
to
devonport
merely
to
bid
her
aunt
farewell
he
determined
therefore
to
get
to
liverpool
without
wasting
time
at
devonport
to
institute
inquiries
not
suspecting
the
delay
in
the
transit
of
the
letter
he
thought
he
might
yet
stop
her
even
at
the
or
on
the
tender
unfortunately
his
cab
went
slowly
in
the
fog
he
missed
the
first
train
and
wandered
about
brooding
disconsolately
in
the
mist
till
the
second
at
liverpool
his
suspicious
excited
demeanor
procured
his
momentary
arrest
since
then
the
thought
of
the
lost
girl
has
haunted
and
broken
him
that
is
the
whole
the
plain
and
the
sufficing
story
the
effective
witnesses
for
the
defense
were
indeed
few
it
is
so
hard
to
prove
a
negative
there
was
jessie
aunt
who
bore
out
the
statement
of
the
counsel
for
the
defense
there
were
the
porters
who
saw
him
leave
euston
by
the
train
for
liverpool
and
arrive
just
too
late
for
the
there
was
the
cabman
who
drove
him
to
euston
just
in
time
he
witness
thought
to
catch
the
under
the
cabman
got
a
little
confused
he
was
asked
whether
if
he
really
picked
up
the
prisoner
at
bow
railway
station
at
about
he
ought
not
to
have
caught
the
first
train
at
euston
he
said
the
fog
made
him
drive
rather
slowly
but
admitted
the
mist
was
transparent
enough
to
warrant
full
speed
he
also
admitted
being
a
strong
trade
unionist
spigot
artfully
extorting
the
admission
as
if
it
were
of
the
utmost
significance
finally
there
were
numerous
witnesses
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
to
the
prisoner
high
character
as
well
as
to
arthur
constant
blameless
and
moral
life
in
his
closing
speech
on
the
third
day
of
the
trial
sir
charles
pointed
out
with
great
exhaustiveness
and
cogency
the
flimsiness
of
the
case
for
the
prosecution
the
number
of
hypotheses
it
involved
and
their
mutual
interdependence
drabdump
was
a
witness
whose
evidence
must
be
accepted
with
extreme
caution
the
jury
must
remember
that
she
was
unable
to
dissociate
her
observations
from
her
inferences
and
thought
that
the
prisoner
and
mr
constant
were
quarreling
merely
because
they
were
agitated
he
dissected
her
evidence
and
showed
that
it
entirely
bore
out
the
story
of
the
defense
he
asked
the
jury
to
bear
in
mind
that
no
positive
evidence
whether
of
cabmen
or
others
had
been
given
of
the
various
and
complicated
movements
attributed
to
the
prisoner
on
the
morning
of
december
between
the
hours
of
and
and
that
the
most
important
witness
on
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
he
meant
of
course
miss
dymond
had
not
been
produced
even
if
she
were
dead
and
her
body
were
found
no
countenance
would
be
given
to
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
for
the
mere
conviction
that
her
lover
had
deserted
her
would
be
a
sufficient
explanation
of
her
suicide
beyond
the
ambiguous
letter
no
tittle
of
evidence
of
her
dishonor
on
which
the
bulk
of
the
case
against
the
prisoner
rested
had
been
adduced
as
for
the
motive
of
political
jealousy
that
had
been
a
mere
passing
cloud
the
two
men
had
become
fast
friends
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
alleged
crime
the
medical
evidence
was
on
the
whole
in
favor
of
the
time
of
death
being
late
and
the
prisoner
had
left
london
at
a
quarter
past
seven
the
drugging
theory
was
absurd
and
as
for
the
too
clever
bolt
and
lock
theories
grodman
a
trained
scientific
observer
had
them
he
would
solemnly
exhort
the
jury
to
remember
that
if
they
condemned
the
prisoner
they
would
not
only
send
an
innocent
man
to
an
ignominious
death
on
the
flimsiest
circumstantial
evidence
but
they
would
deprive
the
workingmen
of
this
country
of
one
of
their
truest
friends
and
their
ablest
leader
the
conclusion
of
sir
charles
vigorous
speech
was
greeted
with
irrepressible
applause
mr
spigot
in
closing
the
case
for
the
prosecution
asked
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
against
the
prisoner
for
as
malicious
and
premeditated
a
crime
as
ever
disgraced
the
annals
of
any
civilized
country
his
cleverness
and
education
had
only
been
utilized
for
the
devil
ends
while
his
reputation
had
been
used
as
a
cloak
everything
pointed
strongly
to
the
prisoner
guilt
on
receiving
miss
letter
announcing
her
shame
and
probably
her
intention
to
commit
suicide
he
had
hastened
upstairs
to
denounce
constant
he
had
then
rushed
to
the
girl
lodgings
and
finding
his
worst
fears
confirmed
planned
at
once
his
diabolically
ingenious
scheme
of
revenge
he
told
his
landlady
he
was
going
to
devonport
so
that
if
he
bungled
the
police
would
be
put
temporarily
off
his
track
his
real
destination
was
liverpool
for
he
intended
to
leave
the
country
lest
however
his
plan
should
break
down
here
too
he
arranged
an
ingenious
alibi
by
being
driven
to
euston
for
the
train
to
liverpool
the
cabman
would
not
know
he
did
not
intend
to
go
by
it
but
meant
to
return
to
glover
street
there
to
perpetrate
this
foul
crime
interruption
to
which
he
had
possibly
barred
by
drugging
his
landlady
his
presence
at
liverpool
whither
he
really
went
by
the
second
train
would
corroborate
the
cabman
story
that
night
he
had
not
undressed
nor
gone
to
bed
he
had
plotted
out
his
devilish
scheme
till
it
was
perfect
the
fog
came
as
an
unexpected
ally
to
cover
his
movements
jealousy
outraged
affection
the
desire
for
revenge
the
lust
for
political
power
these
were
human
they
might
pity
the
criminal
they
could
not
find
him
innocent
of
the
crime
justice
crogie
summing
up
began
dead
against
the
prisoner
reviewing
the
evidence
he
pointed
out
that
plausible
hypotheses
neatly
did
not
necessarily
weaken
one
another
the
fitting
so
well
together
of
the
whole
rather
making
for
the
truth
of
the
parts
besides
the
case
for
the
prosecution
was
as
far
from
being
all
hypothesis
as
the
case
for
the
defense
was
from
excluding
hypothesis
the
key
the
letter
the
reluctance
to
produce
the
letter
the
heated
interview
with
constant
the
misstatement
about
the
prisoner
destination
the
flight
to
liverpool
the
false
tale
about
searching
for
a
him
the
denunciations
of
constant
all
these
were
facts
on
the
other
hand
there
were
various
lacunae
and
hypotheses
in
the
case
for
the
defense
even
conceding
the
somewhat
dubious
alibi
afforded
by
the
presence
at
euston
at
there
was
no
attempt
to
account
for
his
movements
between
that
and
it
was
as
possible
that
he
returned
to
bow
as
that
he
lingered
about
euston
there
was
nothing
in
the
medical
evidence
to
make
his
guilt
impossible
nor
was
there
anything
inherently
impossible
in
constant
yielding
to
the
sudden
temptation
of
a
beautiful
girl
nor
in
a
deeming
herself
deserted
temporarily
succumbing
to
the
fascinations
of
a
gentleman
and
regretting
it
bitterly
afterward
what
had
become
of
the
girl
was
a
mystery
hers
might
have
been
one
of
those
nameless
corpses
which
the
tide
swirls
up
on
slimy
river
banks
the
jury
must
remember
too
that
the
relation
might
not
have
actually
passed
into
dishonor
it
might
have
been
just
grave
enough
to
smite
the
girl
conscience
and
to
induce
her
to
behave
as
she
had
done
it
was
enough
that
her
letter
should
have
excited
the
jealousy
of
the
prisoner
there
was
one
other
point
which
he
would
like
to
impress
on
the
jury
and
which
the
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
not
sufficiently
insisted
upon
this
was
that
the
prisoner
guiltiness
was
the
only
plausible
solution
that
had
ever
been
advanced
of
the
bow
mystery
the
medical
evidence
agreed
that
mr
constant
did
not
die
by
his
own
hand
someone
must
therefore
have
murdered
him
the
number
of
people
who
could
have
had
any
possible
reason
or
opportunity
to
murder
him
was
extremely
small
the
prisoner
had
both
reason
and
opportunity
by
what
logicians
called
the
method
of
exclusion
suspicion
would
attach
to
him
on
even
slight
evidence
the
actual
evidence
was
strong
and
plausible
and
now
that
ingenious
theory
had
enabled
them
to
understand
how
the
door
could
have
been
apparently
locked
and
bolted
from
within
the
last
difficulty
and
the
last
argument
for
suicide
had
been
removed
the
prisoner
guilt
was
as
clear
as
circumstantial
evidence
could
make
it
if
they
let
him
go
free
the
bow
mystery
might
henceforward
be
placed
among
the
archives
of
unavenged
assassinations
having
thus
hung
the
prisoner
the
judge
wound
up
by
insisting
on
the
high
probability
of
the
story
for
the
defense
though
that
too
was
dependent
in
important
details
upon
the
prisoner
mere
private
statements
to
his
counsel
the
jury
being
by
this
time
sufficiently
muddled
by
his
impartiality
were
dismissed
with
the
exhortation
to
allow
due
weight
to
every
fact
and
probability
in
determining
their
righteous
verdict
the
minutes
ran
into
hours
but
the
jury
did
not
return
the
shadows
of
night
fell
across
the
reeking
fevered
court
before
they
announced
their
verdict
guilty
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
the
great
reception
arranged
outside
was
a
fiasco
the
evening
banquet
was
indefinitely
postponed
wimp
had
won
grodman
felt
like
a
whipped
cur
chapter
xi
so
you
were
right
denzil
could
not
help
saying
as
he
greeted
grodman
a
week
afterward
i
shall
not
live
to
tell
the
story
of
how
you
discovered
the
bow
murderer
sit
down
growled
grodman
perhaps
you
will
after
all
there
was
a
dangerous
gleam
in
his
eyes
denzil
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
i
sent
for
you
grodman
said
to
tell
you
that
on
the
night
wimp
arrested
mortlake
i
had
made
preparations
for
your
arrest
denzil
gasped
what
for
my
dear
denzil
there
is
a
little
law
in
this
country
invented
for
the
confusion
of
the
poetic
the
greatest
exponent
of
the
beautiful
is
only
allowed
the
same
number
of
wives
as
the
greengrocer
i
do
not
blame
you
for
not
being
satisfied
with
jane
she
is
a
good
servant
but
a
bad
mistress
but
it
was
cruel
to
kitty
not
to
inform
her
that
jane
had
a
prior
right
in
you
and
unjust
to
jane
not
to
let
her
know
of
the
contract
with
kitty
they
both
know
it
now
well
enough
curse
said
the
poet
yes
your
secrets
are
like
your
situations
you
ca
keep
them
long
my
poor
poet
i
pity
you
betwixt
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
they
a
pair
of
harpies
each
holding
over
me
the
damocles
sword
of
an
arrest
for
bigamy
neither
loves
me
i
should
think
they
would
come
in
very
useful
to
you
you
plant
one
in
my
house
to
tell
my
secrets
to
wimp
and
you
plant
one
in
wimp
house
to
tell
wimp
secrets
to
me
i
suppose
out
with
some
then
upon
my
honor
you
wrong
me
jane
brought
me
here
not
i
jane
as
for
kitty
i
never
had
such
a
shock
in
my
life
as
at
finding
her
installed
in
wimp
house
she
thought
it
safer
to
have
the
law
handy
for
your
arrest
besides
she
probably
desired
to
occupy
a
parallel
position
to
jane
she
must
do
something
for
a
living
you
would
do
anything
for
hers
and
so
you
could
go
anywhere
without
meeting
a
wife
ha
ha
ha
serve
you
right
my
polygamous
poet
but
why
should
you
arrest
me
revenge
denzil
i
have
been
the
best
friend
you
ever
had
in
this
cold
prosaic
world
you
have
eaten
my
bread
drunk
my
claret
written
my
book
smoked
my
cigars
and
pocketed
my
money
and
yet
when
you
have
an
important
piece
of
information
bearing
on
a
mystery
about
which
i
am
thinking
day
and
night
you
calmly
go
and
sell
it
to
wimp
i
stammered
denzil
liar
do
you
think
kitty
has
any
secrets
from
me
as
soon
as
i
discovered
your
two
marriages
i
determined
to
have
you
arrested
for
your
treachery
but
when
i
found
you
had
as
i
thought
put
wimp
on
the
wrong
scent
when
i
felt
sure
that
by
arresting
mortlake
he
was
going
to
make
a
greater
ass
of
himself
than
even
nature
had
been
able
to
do
then
i
forgave
you
i
let
you
walk
about
the
earth
and
drink
freely
now
it
is
wimp
who
crows
everybody
pats
him
on
the
back
they
call
him
the
mystery
man
of
the
tribe
poor
tom
mortlake
will
be
hanged
and
all
through
your
telling
wimp
about
jessie
dymond
it
was
you
yourself
said
denzil
sullenly
everybody
was
giving
it
up
but
you
said
us
find
out
all
that
arthur
constant
did
in
the
last
few
months
of
his
life
wimp
could
miss
stumbling
on
jessie
sooner
or
later
i
have
throttled
constant
if
i
had
known
touched
her
he
wound
up
with
irrelevant
indignation
grodman
winced
at
the
idea
that
he
himself
had
worked
majorem
of
wimp
and
yet
had
not
wimp
let
out
as
much
at
the
christmas
dinner
what
past
is
past
he
said
gruffly
but
if
tom
mortlake
hangs
you
go
to
portland
how
can
i
help
tom
hanging
help
the
agitation
as
much
as
you
can
write
letters
under
all
sorts
of
names
to
all
the
papers
get
everybody
you
know
to
sign
the
great
petition
find
out
where
jessie
dymond
is
the
girl
who
holds
the
proof
of
tom
mortlake
innocence
you
really
believe
him
innocent
do
be
satirical
denzil
have
i
taken
the
chair
at
all
the
meetings
am
i
not
the
most
copious
correspondent
of
the
press
i
thought
it
was
only
to
spite
wimp
rubbish
it
to
save
poor
tom
he
no
more
murdered
arthur
constant
than
you
did
he
laughed
an
unpleasant
laugh
denzil
bade
him
farewell
frigid
with
fear
grodman
was
up
to
his
ears
in
letters
and
telegrams
somehow
he
had
become
the
leader
of
the
rescue
party
suggestions
subscriptions
came
from
all
sides
the
suggestions
were
burnt
the
subscriptions
acknowledged
in
the
papers
and
used
for
hunting
up
the
missing
girl
lucy
brent
headed
the
list
with
a
hundred
pounds
it
was
a
fine
testimony
to
her
faith
in
her
dead
lover
honor
the
release
of
the
jury
had
unloosed
the
greater
jury
which
always
now
sits
upon
the
smaller
every
means
was
taken
to
nullify
the
value
of
the
palladium
of
british
liberty
the
foreman
and
the
jurors
were
interviewed
the
judge
was
judged
and
by
those
who
were
no
judges
the
home
secretary
who
had
done
nothing
beyond
accepting
office
under
the
crown
was
vituperated
and
sundry
provincial
persons
wrote
confidentially
to
the
queen
arthur
constant
backsliding
cheered
many
by
convincing
them
that
others
were
as
bad
as
themselves
and
tradesmen
saw
in
mortlake
wickedness
the
pernicious
effects
of
socialism
a
dozen
new
theories
were
afloat
constant
had
committed
suicide
by
esoteric
buddhism
as
witness
his
devotion
to
mme
blavatsky
or
he
had
been
murdered
by
his
mahatma
or
victimized
by
hypnotism
mesmerism
somnambulism
and
other
weird
abstractions
grodman
great
point
was
jessie
dymond
must
be
produced
dead
or
alive
the
electric
current
scoured
the
civilized
world
in
search
of
her
what
wonder
if
the
shrewder
sort
divined
that
the
indomitable
detective
had
fixed
his
last
hope
on
the
girl
guilt
if
jessie
had
wrongs
why
should
she
not
have
avenged
them
herself
did
she
not
always
remind
the
poet
of
joan
of
arc
another
week
passed
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
crept
over
the
days
on
on
remorselessly
drawing
nearer
as
the
last
ray
of
hope
sank
below
the
horizon
the
home
secretary
remained
inflexible
the
great
petitions
discharged
their
signatures
at
him
in
vain
he
was
a
conservative
sternly
conscientious
and
the
mere
insinuation
that
his
obstinacy
was
due
to
the
politics
of
the
condemned
only
hardened
him
against
the
temptation
of
a
cheap
reputation
for
magnanimity
he
would
not
even
grant
a
respite
to
increase
the
chances
of
the
discovery
of
jessie
dymond
in
the
last
of
the
three
weeks
there
was
a
final
monster
meeting
of
protest
grodman
again
took
the
chair
and
several
distinguished
faddists
were
present
as
well
as
numerous
respectable
members
of
society
the
home
secretary
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
their
resolutions
the
trade
unions
were
divided
in
their
allegiance
some
whispered
of
faith
and
hope
others
of
financial
defalcations
the
former
essayed
to
organize
a
procession
and
an
indignation
meeting
on
the
sunday
preceding
the
tuesday
fixed
for
the
execution
but
it
fell
through
on
a
rumor
of
confession
the
monday
papers
contained
a
last
masterly
letter
from
grodman
exposing
the
weakness
of
the
evidence
but
they
knew
nothing
of
a
confession
the
prisoner
was
mute
and
disdainful
professing
little
regard
for
a
life
empty
of
love
and
burdened
with
he
refused
to
see
clergymen
he
was
accorded
an
interview
with
miss
brent
in
the
presence
of
a
jailer
and
solemnly
asseverated
his
respect
for
her
dead
lover
memory
monday
buzzed
with
rumors
the
evening
papers
chronicled
them
hour
by
hour
a
poignant
anxiety
was
abroad
the
girl
would
be
found
some
miracle
would
happen
a
reprieve
would
arrive
the
sentence
would
be
commuted
but
the
short
day
darkened
into
night
even
as
mortlake
short
day
was
darkening
and
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
crept
on
and
on
and
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
twilight
crowl
stood
at
the
door
of
his
shop
unable
to
work
his
big
gray
eyes
were
heavy
with
unshed
tears
the
dingy
wintry
road
seemed
one
vast
cemetery
the
street
lamps
twinkled
like
the
confused
sounds
of
the
reached
his
ear
as
from
another
world
he
did
not
see
the
people
who
flitted
to
and
fro
amid
the
gathering
shadows
of
the
cold
dreary
night
one
ghastly
vision
flashed
and
faded
and
flashed
upon
the
background
of
the
duskiness
denzil
stood
beside
him
smoking
in
silence
a
cold
fear
was
at
his
heart
that
terrible
grodman
as
the
hangman
cord
was
tightening
round
mortlake
he
felt
the
convict
chains
tightening
round
himself
and
yet
there
was
one
gleam
of
hope
feeble
as
the
yellow
flicker
of
the
across
the
way
grodman
had
obtained
an
interview
with
the
condemned
late
that
afternoon
and
the
parting
had
been
painful
but
the
evening
paper
that
in
its
turn
had
obtained
an
interview
with
the
announced
on
its
placard
grodman
still
confident
and
the
thousands
who
yet
pinned
their
faith
on
this
extraordinary
man
refused
to
extinguish
the
last
sparks
of
hope
denzil
had
bought
the
paper
and
scanned
it
eagerly
but
there
was
nothing
save
the
vague
assurance
that
the
indefatigable
grodman
was
still
almost
pathetically
expectant
of
the
miracle
denzil
did
not
share
the
expectation
he
meditated
flight
peter
he
said
at
last
i
afraid
it
all
over
crowl
nodded
all
over
he
repeated
and
to
think
that
he
dies
and
it
is
all
over
he
looked
despairingly
at
the
blank
winter
sky
where
leaden
clouds
shut
out
the
stars
poor
poor
young
fellow
alive
and
thinking
night
a
clod
with
no
more
sense
or
motion
than
a
bit
of
leather
no
compensation
nowhere
for
being
cut
off
innocent
in
the
pride
of
youth
and
strength
a
man
who
has
always
preached
the
useful
day
and
night
and
toiled
and
suffered
for
his
fellows
where
the
justice
of
it
where
the
justice
of
it
he
demanded
fiercely
again
his
wet
eyes
wandered
upward
toward
heaven
that
heaven
away
from
which
the
soul
of
a
dead
saint
at
the
antipodes
was
speeding
into
infinite
space
well
where
was
the
justice
for
arthur
constant
if
he
too
was
innocent
said
denzil
really
peter
i
do
see
why
you
should
take
it
for
granted
that
tom
is
so
dreadfully
injured
your
labor
leaders
are
after
all
men
of
no
aesthetic
refinement
with
no
sense
of
the
beautiful
you
can
not
expect
them
to
be
exempt
from
the
coarser
forms
of
crime
humanity
must
look
to
for
other
leaders
to
the
seers
and
the
poets
cantercot
if
you
say
tom
guilty
i
knock
you
down
the
little
cobbler
turned
upon
his
tall
friend
like
a
roused
lion
then
he
added
i
beg
your
pardon
cantercot
i
do
mean
that
after
all
i
no
grounds
the
judge
is
an
honest
man
and
with
gifts
i
ca
lay
claim
to
but
i
believe
in
tom
with
all
my
heart
and
if
tom
is
guilty
i
believe
in
the
cause
of
the
people
with
all
my
heart
all
the
same
the
fads
are
doomed
to
death
they
may
be
reprieved
but
they
must
die
at
last
he
drew
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
along
the
dreary
road
it
was
quite
dark
now
but
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
and
the
gas
in
the
shop
windows
the
dull
monotonous
road
lay
revealed
in
all
its
sordid
familiar
outlines
with
its
long
stretches
of
chill
pavement
its
unlovely
architecture
and
its
endless
stream
of
prosaic
pedestrians
a
sudden
consciousness
of
the
futility
of
his
existence
pierced
the
little
cobbler
like
an
icy
wind
he
saw
his
own
life
and
a
hundred
million
lives
like
his
swelling
and
breaking
like
bubbles
on
a
dark
ocean
unheeded
uncared
for
a
newsboy
passed
along
clamoring
the
bow
murderer
preparations
for
the
hexecution
a
terrible
shudder
shook
the
cobbler
frame
his
eyes
ranged
sightlessly
after
the
boy
the
merciful
tears
filled
them
at
last
the
cause
of
the
people
he
murmured
brokenly
i
believe
in
the
cause
of
the
people
there
is
nothing
else
peter
come
in
to
tea
you
catch
cold
said
crowl
denzil
went
in
to
tea
and
peter
followed
meantime
round
the
house
of
the
home
secretary
who
was
in
town
an
crowd
was
gathered
eager
to
catch
the
first
whisper
of
a
reprieve
the
house
was
guarded
by
a
cordon
of
police
for
there
was
no
inconsiderable
danger
of
a
popular
riot
at
times
a
section
of
the
crowd
groaned
and
hooted
once
a
volley
of
stones
was
discharged
at
the
windows
the
were
busy
vending
their
special
editions
and
the
reporters
struggled
through
the
crowd
clutching
descriptive
pencils
and
ready
to
rush
off
to
telegraph
offices
should
anything
extra
special
occur
telegraph
boys
were
coming
up
every
now
and
again
with
threats
messages
petitions
and
exhortations
from
all
parts
of
the
country
to
the
unfortunate
home
secretary
who
was
striving
to
keep
his
aching
head
cool
as
he
went
through
the
voluminous
evidence
for
the
last
time
and
pondered
over
the
more
important
letters
which
the
greater
jury
had
contributed
to
the
obscuration
of
the
problem
letter
in
that
morning
paper
shook
him
most
under
his
scientific
analysis
the
circumstantial
chain
seemed
forged
of
painted
cardboard
then
the
poor
man
read
the
judge
summing
up
and
the
chain
became
tempered
steel
the
noise
of
the
crowd
outside
broke
upon
his
ear
in
his
study
like
the
roar
of
a
distant
ocean
the
more
the
rabble
hooted
him
the
more
he
essayed
to
hold
scrupulously
the
scales
of
life
and
death
and
the
crowd
grew
and
grew
as
men
came
away
from
their
work
there
were
many
that
loved
the
man
who
lay
in
the
jaws
of
death
and
a
spirit
of
mad
revolt
surged
in
their
breasts
and
the
sky
was
gray
and
the
bleak
night
deepened
and
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
crept
on
suddenly
a
strange
inarticulate
murmur
spread
through
the
crowd
a
vague
whisper
of
no
one
knew
what
something
had
happened
somebody
was
coming
a
second
later
and
one
of
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
was
agitated
and
a
convulsive
cheer
went
up
from
it
and
was
taken
up
infectiously
all
along
the
street
the
crowd
parted
a
hansom
dashed
through
the
center
grodman
grodman
shouted
those
who
recognized
the
occupant
grodman
hurrah
grodman
was
outwardly
calm
and
pale
but
his
eyes
glittered
he
waved
his
hand
encouragingly
as
the
hansom
dashed
up
to
the
door
cleaving
the
turbulent
crowd
as
a
canoe
cleaves
the
waters
grodman
sprang
out
the
constables
at
the
portal
made
way
for
him
respectfully
he
knocked
imperatively
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
a
boy
rushed
up
and
delivered
a
telegram
grodman
forced
his
way
in
gave
his
name
and
insisted
on
seeing
the
home
secretary
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
those
near
the
door
heard
his
words
and
cheered
and
the
crowd
divined
the
good
omen
and
the
air
throbbed
with
cannonades
of
joyous
sound
the
cheers
rang
in
grodman
ears
as
the
door
slammed
behind
him
the
reporters
struggled
to
the
front
an
excited
knot
of
working
men
pressed
round
the
arrested
hansom
they
took
the
horse
out
a
dozen
enthusiasts
struggled
for
the
honor
of
placing
themselves
between
the
shafts
and
the
crowd
awaited
grodman
chapter
xii
grodman
was
ushered
into
the
conscientious
minister
study
the
doughty
chief
of
the
agitation
was
perhaps
the
one
man
who
could
not
be
denied
as
he
entered
the
home
secretary
face
seemed
lit
up
with
relief
at
a
sign
from
his
master
the
amanuensis
who
had
brought
in
the
last
telegram
took
it
back
with
him
into
the
outer
room
where
he
worked
needless
to
say
not
a
tithe
of
the
minister
correspondence
ever
came
under
his
own
eyes
you
have
a
valid
reason
for
troubling
me
i
suppose
mr
grodman
said
the
home
secretary
almost
cheerfully
of
course
it
is
about
mortlake
it
is
and
i
have
the
best
of
all
reasons
take
a
seat
proceed
pray
do
not
consider
me
impertinent
but
have
you
ever
given
any
attention
to
the
science
of
evidence
how
do
you
mean
asked
the
home
secretary
rather
puzzled
adding
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
have
had
to
lately
of
course
i
never
been
a
criminal
lawyer
like
some
of
my
predecessors
but
i
should
hardly
speak
of
it
as
a
science
i
look
upon
it
as
a
question
of
pardon
me
sir
it
is
the
most
subtle
and
difficult
of
all
the
sciences
it
is
indeed
rather
the
science
of
the
sciences
what
is
the
whole
of
inductive
logic
as
laid
down
say
by
bacon
and
mill
but
an
attempt
to
appraise
the
value
of
evidence
the
said
evidence
being
the
trails
left
by
the
creator
so
to
speak
the
creator
has
i
say
it
in
all
reverence
drawn
a
myriad
red
herrings
across
the
track
but
the
true
scientist
refuses
to
be
baffled
by
superficial
appearances
in
detecting
the
secrets
of
nature
the
vulgar
herd
catches
at
the
gross
apparent
fact
but
the
man
of
insight
knows
that
what
lies
on
the
surface
does
lie
very
interesting
grodman
but
really
bear
with
me
sir
the
science
of
evidence
being
thus
so
extremely
subtle
and
demanding
the
most
acute
and
trained
observation
of
facts
the
most
comprehensive
understanding
of
human
psychology
is
naturally
given
over
to
professors
who
have
not
the
remotest
idea
that
are
not
what
they
seem
and
that
everything
is
other
than
it
appears
to
professors
most
of
whom
by
their
devotion
to
the
or
the
desk
have
acquired
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
all
the
infinite
shades
and
complexities
of
things
and
human
nature
when
twelve
of
these
professors
are
put
in
a
box
it
is
called
a
jury
when
one
of
these
professors
is
put
in
a
box
by
himself
he
is
called
a
witness
the
retailing
of
evidence
the
observation
of
the
facts
is
given
over
to
people
who
go
through
their
lives
without
eyes
the
appreciation
of
evidence
the
judging
of
these
facts
is
surrendered
to
people
who
may
possibly
be
adepts
in
weighing
out
pounds
of
sugar
apart
from
their
sheer
inability
to
fulfill
either
function
to
observe
or
to
judge
their
observation
and
their
judgment
alike
are
vitiated
by
all
sorts
of
irrelevant
prejudices
you
are
attacking
trial
by
jury
not
necessarily
i
am
prepared
to
accept
that
scientifically
on
the
ground
that
as
there
are
as
a
rule
only
two
alternatives
the
balance
of
probability
is
slightly
in
favor
of
the
true
decision
being
come
to
then
in
cases
where
experts
like
myself
have
got
up
the
evidence
the
jury
can
be
made
to
see
through
trained
eyes
the
home
secretary
tapped
impatiently
with
his
foot
i
ca
listen
to
abstract
theorizing
he
said
have
you
any
fresh
concrete
evidence
sir
everything
depends
on
our
getting
down
to
the
root
of
the
matter
what
percentage
of
average
evidence
should
you
think
is
thorough
plain
simple
unvarnished
fact
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
fifty
said
the
minister
humoring
him
a
little
not
five
i
say
nothing
of
lapses
of
memory
of
inborn
defects
of
observational
power
though
the
suspiciously
precise
recollection
of
dates
and
events
possessed
by
ordinary
witnesses
in
important
trials
taking
place
years
after
the
occurrences
involved
is
one
of
the
most
amazing
things
in
the
curiosities
of
modern
jurisprudence
i
defy
you
sir
to
tell
me
what
you
had
for
dinner
last
monday
or
what
exactly
you
were
saying
and
doing
at
five
last
tuesday
afternoon
nobody
whose
life
does
not
run
in
mechanical
grooves
can
do
anything
of
the
sort
unless
of
course
the
facts
have
been
very
impressive
but
this
by
the
way
the
great
obstacle
to
veracious
observation
is
the
element
of
prepossession
in
all
vision
has
it
ever
struck
you
sir
that
we
never
see
anyone
more
than
once
if
that
the
first
time
we
meet
a
man
we
may
possibly
see
him
as
he
is
the
second
time
our
vision
is
colored
and
modified
by
the
memory
of
the
first
do
our
friends
appear
to
us
as
they
appear
to
strangers
do
our
rooms
our
furniture
our
pipes
strike
our
eye
as
they
would
strike
the
eye
of
an
outsider
looking
on
them
for
the
first
time
can
a
mother
see
her
babe
ugliness
or
a
lover
his
mistress
shortcomings
though
they
stare
everybody
else
in
the
face
can
we
see
ourselves
as
others
see
us
no
habit
prepossession
changes
all
the
mind
is
a
large
factor
of
every
external
fact
the
eye
sees
sometimes
what
it
wishes
to
see
more
often
what
it
expects
to
see
you
follow
me
sir
the
home
secretary
nodded
his
head
less
impatiently
he
was
beginning
to
be
interested
the
hubbub
from
without
broke
faintly
upon
their
ears
to
give
you
a
definite
example
wimp
says
that
when
i
burst
open
the
door
of
mr
constant
room
on
the
morning
of
december
and
saw
that
the
staple
of
the
bolt
had
been
wrested
by
the
pin
from
the
lintel
i
jumped
at
once
to
the
conclusion
that
i
had
broken
the
bolt
now
i
admit
that
this
was
so
only
in
things
like
this
you
do
not
seem
to
conclude
you
jump
so
fast
that
you
see
or
seem
to
on
the
other
hand
when
you
see
a
standing
ring
of
fire
produced
by
whirling
a
burning
stick
you
do
not
believe
in
its
continuous
existence
it
is
the
same
when
witnessing
a
legerdemain
performance
seeing
is
not
always
believing
despite
the
proverb
but
believing
is
often
seeing
it
is
not
to
the
point
that
in
that
little
matter
of
the
door
wimp
was
as
hopelessly
and
incurably
wrong
as
he
has
been
in
everything
all
along
though
the
door
was
securely
bolted
i
confess
that
i
should
have
seen
that
i
had
broken
the
bolt
in
forcing
the
door
even
if
it
had
been
broken
beforehand
never
once
since
december
did
this
possibility
occur
to
me
till
wimp
with
perverted
ingenuity
suggested
it
if
this
is
the
case
with
a
trained
observer
one
moreover
fully
conscious
of
this
ineradicable
tendency
of
the
human
mind
how
must
it
be
with
an
untrained
observer
come
to
the
point
come
to
the
point
said
the
home
secretary
putting
out
his
hand
as
if
it
itched
to
touch
the
bell
on
the
such
as
went
on
grodman
imperturbably
such
as
drabdump
that
worthy
person
is
unable
by
repeated
violent
knocking
to
arouse
her
lodger
who
yet
desires
to
be
aroused
she
becomes
alarmed
she
rushes
across
to
get
my
assistance
i
burst
open
the
door
what
do
you
think
the
good
lady
expected
to
see
mr
constant
murdered
i
suppose
murmured
the
home
secretary
wonderingly
exactly
and
so
she
saw
it
and
what
should
you
think
was
the
condition
of
arthur
constant
when
the
door
yielded
to
my
violent
exertions
and
flew
open
why
was
he
not
dead
gasped
the
home
secretary
his
heart
fluttering
violently
dead
a
young
healthy
fellow
like
that
when
the
door
flew
open
arthur
constant
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
it
was
a
deep
a
very
deep
sleep
of
course
else
the
blows
at
his
door
would
long
since
have
awakened
him
but
all
the
while
drabdump
fancy
was
picturing
her
lodger
cold
and
stark
the
poor
young
fellow
was
lying
in
bed
in
a
nice
warm
sleep
you
mean
to
say
you
found
arthur
constant
alive
as
you
were
last
night
the
minister
was
silent
striving
confusedly
to
take
in
the
situation
outside
the
crowd
was
cheering
again
it
was
probably
to
pass
the
time
then
when
was
he
murdered
immediately
afterward
by
whom
well
that
is
if
you
will
pardon
me
not
a
very
intelligent
question
science
and
are
in
accord
for
once
try
the
method
of
exhaustion
it
must
have
been
either
by
drabdump
or
by
myself
you
mean
to
say
that
mrs
drabdump
poor
dear
drabdump
you
do
deserve
this
of
your
home
secretary
the
idea
of
that
good
lady
it
was
you
calm
yourself
my
dear
home
secretary
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
it
was
a
solitary
experiment
and
i
intend
it
to
remain
so
the
noise
without
grew
louder
three
cheers
for
grodman
hip
hip
hip
hooray
fell
faintly
on
their
ears
but
the
minister
pallid
and
deeply
moved
touched
the
bell
the
home
secretary
home
secretary
appeared
he
looked
at
the
great
agitated
face
with
suppressed
surprise
thank
you
for
calling
in
your
amanuensis
said
grodman
i
intended
to
ask
you
to
lend
me
his
services
i
suppose
he
can
write
shorthand
the
minister
nodded
speechless
that
is
well
i
intend
this
statement
to
form
the
basis
of
an
appendix
to
the
edition
sort
of
silver
wedding
of
my
book
i
have
caught
denzil
cantercot
who
by
the
will
i
have
made
is
appointed
my
literary
executor
will
have
the
task
of
working
it
up
with
literary
and
dramatic
touches
after
the
model
of
the
other
chapters
of
my
book
i
have
every
confidence
he
will
be
able
to
do
me
as
much
justice
from
a
literary
point
of
view
as
you
sir
no
doubt
will
from
a
legal
i
feel
certain
he
will
succeed
in
catching
the
style
of
the
other
chapters
to
perfection
templeton
whispered
the
home
secretary
this
man
may
be
a
lunatic
the
effort
to
solve
the
big
bow
mystery
may
have
addled
his
brain
still
he
added
aloud
it
will
be
as
well
for
you
to
take
down
his
statement
in
shorthand
thank
you
sir
said
grodman
heartily
ready
templeton
here
goes
my
career
till
i
left
the
detective
department
is
known
to
all
the
world
is
that
too
fast
for
you
templeton
a
little
well
i
go
slower
but
pull
me
up
if
i
forget
to
keep
the
brake
on
when
i
retired
i
discovered
that
i
was
a
bachelor
but
it
was
too
late
to
marry
time
hung
on
my
hands
the
preparation
of
my
book
i
have
caught
kept
me
occupied
for
some
months
when
it
was
published
i
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
think
i
had
plenty
of
money
and
it
was
safely
invested
there
was
no
call
for
speculation
the
future
was
meaningless
to
me
i
regretted
i
had
not
elected
to
die
in
harness
as
idle
old
men
must
i
lived
in
the
past
i
went
over
and
over
again
my
ancient
exploits
i
my
book
and
as
i
thought
and
thought
away
from
the
excitement
of
the
actual
hunt
and
seeing
the
facts
in
a
truer
perspective
so
it
grew
daily
clearer
to
me
that
criminals
were
more
fools
than
rogues
every
crime
i
had
traced
however
cleverly
perpetrated
was
from
the
point
of
view
of
penetrability
a
weak
failure
traces
and
trails
were
left
on
all
sides
ragged
edges
corners
in
short
the
job
was
botched
artistic
completeness
unattained
to
the
vulgar
my
feats
might
seem
marvelous
the
average
man
is
mystified
to
grasp
how
you
detect
the
letter
in
a
simple
cryptogram
to
myself
they
were
as
commonplace
as
the
crimes
they
unveiled
to
me
now
with
my
lifelong
study
of
the
science
of
evidence
it
seemed
possible
to
commit
not
merely
one
but
a
thousand
crimes
that
should
be
absolutely
undiscoverable
and
yet
criminals
would
go
on
sinning
and
giving
themselves
away
in
the
same
old
grooves
no
originality
no
dash
no
individual
insight
no
fresh
conception
one
would
imagine
there
were
an
academy
of
crime
with
forty
thousand
armchairs
and
gradually
as
i
pondered
and
brooded
over
the
thought
there
came
upon
me
the
desire
to
commit
a
crime
that
should
baffle
detection
i
could
invent
hundreds
of
such
crimes
and
please
myself
by
imagining
them
done
but
would
they
really
work
out
in
practice
evidently
the
sole
performer
of
my
experiment
must
be
myself
the
subject
whom
or
what
accident
should
determine
i
itched
to
commence
with
murder
to
tackle
the
stiffest
problems
first
and
i
burned
to
startle
and
baffle
the
world
especially
the
world
of
which
i
had
ceased
to
be
outwardly
i
was
calm
and
spoke
to
the
people
about
me
as
usual
inwardly
i
was
on
fire
with
a
consuming
scientific
passion
i
sported
with
my
pet
theories
and
fitted
them
mentally
on
everyone
i
met
every
friend
or
acquaintance
i
sat
and
gossiped
with
i
was
plotting
how
to
murder
without
leaving
a
clue
there
is
not
one
of
my
friends
or
acquaintances
i
have
not
done
away
with
in
thought
there
is
no
public
man
have
no
fear
my
dear
home
secretary
i
have
not
planned
to
assassinate
secretly
mysteriously
unintelligibly
undiscoverably
ah
how
i
could
give
the
stock
criminals
points
with
their
motives
their
conventional
conceptions
their
commonplace
details
their
lack
of
artistic
feeling
and
restraint
the
late
arthur
constant
came
to
live
nearly
opposite
me
i
cultivated
his
acquaintance
he
was
a
lovable
young
fellow
an
excellent
subject
for
experiment
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
ever
taken
to
a
man
more
from
the
moment
i
first
set
eyes
on
him
there
was
a
peculiar
sympathy
between
us
we
were
drawn
to
each
other
i
felt
instinctively
he
would
be
the
man
i
loved
to
hear
him
speak
enthusiastically
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
i
who
knew
the
brotherhood
of
man
was
to
the
ape
the
serpent
and
the
tiger
and
he
seemed
to
find
a
pleasure
in
stealing
a
moment
chat
with
me
from
his
engrossing
duties
it
is
a
pity
humanity
should
have
been
robbed
of
so
valuable
a
life
but
it
had
to
be
at
a
quarter
to
ten
on
the
night
of
december
he
came
to
me
naturally
i
said
nothing
about
this
visit
at
the
inquest
or
the
trial
his
object
was
to
consult
me
mysteriously
about
some
girl
he
said
he
had
privately
lent
her
money
which
she
was
to
repay
at
her
convenience
what
the
money
was
for
he
did
not
know
except
that
it
was
somehow
connected
with
an
act
of
abnegation
in
which
he
had
vaguely
encouraged
her
the
girl
had
since
disappeared
and
he
was
in
distress
about
her
he
would
not
tell
me
who
it
was
of
course
now
sir
you
know
as
well
as
i
it
was
jessie
dymond
but
asked
for
advice
as
to
how
to
set
about
finding
her
he
mentioned
that
mortlake
was
leaving
for
devonport
by
the
first
train
on
the
next
day
of
old
i
should
have
connected
these
two
facts
and
sought
the
thread
now
as
he
spoke
all
my
thoughts
were
dyed
red
he
was
suffering
perceptibly
from
toothache
and
in
answer
to
my
sympathetic
inquiries
told
me
it
had
been
allowing
him
very
little
sleep
everything
combined
to
invite
the
trial
of
one
of
my
favorite
theories
i
spoke
to
him
in
a
fatherly
way
and
when
i
had
tendered
some
vague
advice
about
the
girl
and
made
him
promise
to
secure
a
rest
before
he
faced
the
arduous
meeting
in
the
morning
by
taking
a
i
gave
him
some
sulfonal
in
a
phial
it
is
a
new
drug
which
produces
protracted
sleep
without
disturbing
the
digestion
and
which
i
use
myself
he
promised
faithfully
to
take
the
draught
and
i
also
exhorted
him
earnestly
to
bolt
and
bar
and
lock
himself
in
so
as
to
stop
up
every
chink
or
aperture
by
which
the
cold
air
of
the
winter
night
might
creep
into
the
room
i
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
careless
manner
he
treated
his
body
and
he
laughed
in
his
gentle
way
and
promised
to
obey
me
in
all
things
and
he
did
that
drabdump
failing
to
rouse
him
would
cry
i
took
for
certain
she
is
built
that
way
as
even
sir
charles
remarked
she
habitually
takes
her
prepossessions
for
facts
her
inferences
for
observations
she
forecasts
the
future
in
gray
most
women
of
drabdump
class
would
have
behaved
as
she
did
she
happened
to
be
a
peculiarly
favorable
specimen
for
working
on
by
but
i
would
have
undertaken
to
produce
the
same
effect
on
almost
any
woman
under
similar
conditions
the
only
uncertain
link
in
the
chain
was
would
drabdump
rush
across
to
get
me
to
break
open
the
door
women
always
rush
for
a
man
i
was
the
nearest
and
certainly
the
most
authoritative
man
in
the
street
and
i
took
it
for
granted
she
would
but
suppose
she
had
the
home
secretary
could
not
help
asking
then
the
murder
would
have
happened
that
all
in
due
course
arthur
constant
would
have
awoke
or
somebody
else
breaking
open
the
door
would
have
found
him
sleeping
no
harm
done
nobody
any
the
wiser
i
could
hardly
sleep
myself
that
night
the
thought
of
the
extraordinary
crime
i
was
about
to
commit
a
burning
curiosity
to
know
whether
wimp
would
detect
the
the
prospect
of
sharing
the
feelings
of
murderers
with
whom
i
had
been
in
contact
all
my
life
without
being
in
touch
with
the
terrible
joys
of
their
inner
life
the
fear
lest
i
should
be
too
fast
asleep
to
hear
drabdump
knock
these
things
agitated
me
and
disturbed
my
rest
i
lay
tossing
on
my
bed
planning
every
detail
of
poor
constant
end
the
hours
dragged
slowly
and
wretchedly
on
toward
the
misty
dawn
i
was
racked
with
suspense
was
i
to
be
disappointed
after
all
at
last
the
welcome
sound
came
the
of
murder
the
echoes
of
that
knock
are
yet
in
my
ear
over
and
kill
him
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
told
her
to
wait
for
me
i
dressed
hurriedly
took
my
razor
and
went
across
to
glover
street
as
i
broke
open
the
door
of
the
bedroom
in
which
arthur
constant
lay
sleeping
his
head
resting
on
his
hands
i
cried
god
as
if
i
saw
some
awful
vision
a
mist
as
of
blood
swam
before
drabdump
eyes
she
cowered
back
for
an
instant
i
divined
rather
than
saw
the
action
she
shut
off
the
dreaded
sight
with
her
hands
in
that
instant
i
had
made
my
cut
precisely
scientifically
made
so
deep
a
cut
and
drew
out
the
weapon
so
sharply
that
there
was
scarce
a
drop
of
blood
on
it
then
there
came
from
the
throat
a
jet
of
blood
which
drabdump
conscious
only
of
the
horrid
gash
saw
but
vaguely
i
covered
up
the
face
quickly
with
a
handkerchief
to
hide
any
convulsive
distortion
but
as
the
medical
evidence
in
this
detail
accurate
testified
death
was
instantaneous
i
pocketed
the
razor
and
the
empty
sulfonal
phial
with
a
woman
like
drabdump
to
watch
me
i
could
do
anything
i
pleased
i
got
her
to
draw
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
both
the
windows
were
fastened
some
fool
by
the
by
thought
there
was
a
discrepancy
in
the
evidence
because
the
police
found
only
one
window
fastened
forgetting
that
in
my
innocence
i
took
care
not
to
fasten
the
window
i
had
opened
to
call
for
aid
naturally
i
did
not
call
for
aid
before
a
considerable
time
had
elapsed
there
was
drabdump
to
quiet
and
the
excuse
of
making
notes
as
an
old
hand
my
object
was
to
gain
time
i
wanted
the
body
to
be
fairly
cold
and
stiff
before
being
discovered
though
there
was
not
much
danger
here
for
as
you
saw
by
the
medical
evidence
there
is
no
telling
the
time
of
death
to
an
hour
or
two
the
frank
way
in
which
i
said
the
death
was
very
recent
disarmed
all
suspicion
and
even
robinson
was
unconsciously
worked
upon
in
adjudging
the
time
of
death
by
the
knowledge
query
here
templeton
that
it
had
preceded
my
advent
on
the
scene
before
leaving
drabdump
there
is
just
one
point
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
you
have
listened
so
patiently
sir
to
my
lectures
on
the
science
of
sciences
that
you
will
not
refuse
to
hear
the
last
a
good
deal
of
importance
has
been
attached
to
oversleeping
herself
by
half
an
hour
it
happens
that
this
like
the
innocent
fog
which
has
also
been
made
responsible
for
much
is
a
purely
accidental
and
irrelevant
circumstance
in
all
works
on
inductive
logic
it
is
thoroughly
recognized
that
only
some
of
the
circumstances
of
a
phenomenon
are
of
its
essence
and
causally
interconnected
there
is
always
a
certain
proportion
of
heterogeneous
accompaniments
which
have
no
intimate
relation
whatever
with
the
phenomenon
yet
so
crude
is
as
yet
the
comprehension
of
the
science
of
evidence
that
every
feature
of
the
phenomenon
under
investigation
is
made
equally
important
and
sought
to
be
linked
with
the
chain
of
evidence
to
attempt
to
explain
everything
is
always
the
mark
of
the
tyro
the
fog
and
oversleeping
herself
were
mere
accidents
there
are
always
these
irrelevant
accompaniments
and
the
true
scientist
allows
for
this
element
of
so
to
speak
chemically
unrelated
detail
even
i
never
counted
on
the
unfortunate
series
of
accidental
phenomena
which
have
led
to
mortlake
implication
in
a
network
of
suspicion
on
the
other
hand
the
fact
that
my
servant
jane
who
usually
goes
about
ten
left
a
few
minutes
earlier
on
the
night
of
december
so
that
she
did
know
of
constant
visit
was
a
relevant
accident
in
fact
just
as
the
art
of
the
artist
or
the
editor
consists
largely
in
knowing
what
to
leave
out
so
does
the
art
of
the
scientific
detector
of
crime
consist
in
knowing
what
details
to
ignore
in
short
to
explain
everything
is
to
explain
too
much
and
too
much
is
worse
than
too
little
to
return
to
my
experiment
my
success
exceeded
my
wildest
dreams
none
had
an
inkling
of
the
truth
the
insolubility
of
the
big
bow
mystery
teased
the
acutest
minds
in
europe
and
the
civilized
world
that
a
man
could
have
been
murdered
in
a
thoroughly
inaccessible
room
savored
of
the
ages
of
magic
the
redoubtable
wimp
who
had
been
blazoned
as
my
successor
fell
back
on
the
theory
of
suicide
the
mystery
would
have
slept
till
my
death
but
i
fear
for
my
own
ingenuity
i
tried
to
stand
outside
myself
and
to
look
at
the
crime
with
the
eyes
of
another
or
of
my
old
self
i
found
the
work
of
art
so
perfect
as
to
leave
only
one
sublimely
simple
solution
the
very
terms
of
the
problem
were
so
inconceivable
that
had
i
not
been
the
murderer
i
should
have
suspected
myself
in
conjunction
of
course
with
drabdump
the
first
persons
to
enter
the
room
would
have
seemed
to
me
guilty
i
wrote
at
once
in
a
disguised
hand
and
over
the
signature
of
who
looks
through
his
own
spectacles
to
the
mell
press
to
suggest
this
by
associating
myself
thus
with
drabdump
i
made
it
difficult
for
people
to
dissociate
the
two
who
entered
the
room
together
to
dash
a
in
the
world
eyes
is
the
surest
way
of
blinding
it
altogether
this
letter
of
mine
i
contradicted
myself
in
my
own
name
the
next
day
and
in
the
course
of
the
long
letter
which
i
was
tempted
to
write
i
adduced
fresh
evidence
against
the
theory
of
suicide
i
was
disgusted
with
the
open
verdict
and
wanted
men
to
be
up
and
doing
and
trying
to
find
me
out
i
enjoyed
the
hunt
more
unfortunately
wimp
set
on
the
chase
again
by
my
own
letter
by
dint
of
persistent
blundering
blundered
into
a
track
which
by
a
devilish
tissue
of
coincidences
i
had
neither
foreseen
nor
dreamt
of
seemed
to
the
world
the
true
mortlake
was
arrested
and
condemned
wimp
had
apparently
crowned
his
reputation
this
was
too
much
i
had
taken
all
this
trouble
merely
to
put
a
feather
in
cap
whereas
i
had
expected
to
shake
his
reputation
by
it
it
was
bad
enough
that
an
innocent
man
should
suffer
but
that
wimp
should
achieve
a
reputation
he
did
not
deserve
and
overshadow
all
his
predecessors
by
dint
of
a
colossal
mistake
this
seemed
to
me
intolerable
i
have
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
get
the
verdict
set
aside
and
to
save
the
prisoner
i
have
exposed
the
weakness
of
the
evidence
i
have
had
the
world
searched
for
the
missing
girl
i
have
petitioned
and
agitated
in
vain
i
have
failed
now
i
play
my
last
card
as
the
overweening
wimp
could
not
be
allowed
to
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
solver
of
this
terrible
mystery
i
decided
that
the
condemned
man
might
just
as
well
profit
by
his
exposure
that
is
the
reason
i
make
the
exposure
before
it
is
too
late
to
save
mortlake
so
that
is
the
reason
said
the
home
secretary
with
a
suspicion
of
mockery
in
his
tones
the
sole
reason
even
as
he
spoke
a
deeper
roar
than
ever
penetrated
the
study
the
crowd
had
again
started
cheering
impatient
as
the
watchers
were
they
felt
that
no
news
was
good
news
the
longer
the
interview
accorded
by
the
home
secretary
to
the
chairman
of
the
defense
committee
the
greater
the
hope
his
obduracy
was
melting
the
idol
of
the
people
would
be
saved
and
grodman
and
tom
mortlake
were
mingled
in
the
exultant
plaudits
templeton
said
the
minister
have
you
got
down
every
word
of
grodman
confession
every
word
sir
then
bring
in
the
cable
you
received
just
as
grodman
entered
the
house
templeton
went
back
into
the
outer
room
and
brought
back
the
cablegram
that
had
been
lying
on
the
minister
when
grodman
came
in
the
home
secretary
silently
handed
it
to
his
visitor
it
was
from
the
chief
of
police
of
melbourne
announcing
that
jessie
dymond
had
just
arrived
in
that
city
in
a
sailing
vessel
ignorant
of
all
that
had
occurred
and
had
been
immediately
dispatched
back
to
england
having
made
a
statement
entirely
corroborating
the
theory
of
the
defense
pending
further
inquiries
into
this
said
the
home
secretary
not
without
appreciation
of
the
grim
humor
of
the
situation
as
he
glanced
at
grodman
ashen
cheeks
i
have
reprieved
the
prisoner
templeton
was
about
to
dispatch
the
messenger
to
the
governor
of
newgate
as
you
entered
this
room
wimp
would
have
tumbled
to
pieces
without
your
assistance
your
still
undiscoverable
crime
would
have
shaken
his
reputation
as
you
intended
a
sudden
explosion
shook
the
room
and
blent
with
the
cheers
of
the
populace
