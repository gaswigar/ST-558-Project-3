preface
in
the
year
shortly
before
leaving
england
for
a
long
continental
tour
the
late
william
longman
requested
me
to
make
for
him
some
sketches
of
the
great
alpine
peaks
at
this
time
i
had
only
a
literary
acquaintance
with
mountaineering
and
had
even
not
less
set
foot
mountain
amongst
the
peaks
which
were
upon
my
list
was
mont
pelvoux
in
dauphin√©
the
sketches
that
were
required
of
it
were
to
celebrate
the
triumph
of
some
englishmen
who
intended
to
make
its
ascent
they
they
did
not
conquer
by
a
mere
chance
i
fell
in
with
a
very
agreeable
frenchman
who
accompanied
this
party
and
was
pressed
by
him
to
return
to
the
assault
in
we
did
so
with
my
friend
we
conquered
this
was
the
origin
of
my
scrambles
amongst
the
alps
the
ascent
of
mont
pelvoux
including
the
disagreeables
was
a
very
delightful
scramble
the
mountain
air
did
act
as
an
emetic
the
sky
did
look
black
instead
of
blue
nor
did
i
feel
tempted
to
throw
myself
over
precipices
i
hastened
to
enlarge
my
experience
and
went
to
the
matterhorn
i
was
urged
towards
mont
pelvoux
by
those
mysterious
impulses
which
cause
men
to
peer
into
the
unknown
not
only
was
this
mountain
reputed
to
be
the
highest
in
france
and
on
that
account
was
worthy
of
attention
but
it
was
the
dominating
point
of
a
most
picturesque
district
of
the
greatest
interest
which
to
this
day
remains
almost
unexplored
the
matterhorn
attracted
me
simply
by
its
grandeur
it
was
considered
to
be
the
most
thoroughly
inaccessible
of
all
mountains
even
by
those
who
ought
to
have
known
better
stimulated
to
make
fresh
exertions
by
one
repulse
after
another
i
returned
year
after
year
as
i
had
opportunity
more
and
more
determined
to
find
a
way
up
it
or
to
it
to
be
really
inaccessible
the
chief
part
of
this
volume
is
occupied
by
the
history
of
these
attacks
on
the
matterhorn
and
the
other
excursions
that
are
described
have
all
some
connection
more
or
less
remote
with
that
mountain
or
with
mont
pelvoux
all
are
new
excursions
that
is
excursions
made
for
the
first
time
unless
the
contrary
is
pointed
out
some
have
been
passed
over
very
briefly
and
entire
ascents
or
descents
have
been
disposed
of
in
a
single
line
generally
speaking
the
salient
points
alone
have
been
dwelt
upon
and
the
rest
has
been
left
to
the
imagination
this
treatment
has
spared
the
reader
from
much
useless
repetition
in
endeavouring
to
make
the
book
of
some
use
to
those
who
may
wish
to
go
whether
in
the
alps
or
elsewhere
prominence
has
been
given
to
our
mistakes
and
failures
and
to
some
it
may
seem
that
our
practice
must
have
been
bad
if
the
principles
which
are
laid
down
are
sound
or
that
the
principles
must
be
unsound
if
the
practice
was
good
the
principles
which
are
brought
under
the
notice
of
the
reader
are
however
deduced
from
long
experience
which
experience
had
not
been
gained
at
the
time
that
the
blunders
were
perpetrated
and
if
it
had
been
acquired
at
an
earlier
date
there
would
have
been
fewer
failures
to
record
my
scrambles
amongst
the
alps
were
a
sort
of
apprenticeship
in
the
art
of
mountaineering
and
they
were
for
the
most
part
carried
out
in
the
company
of
men
who
were
masters
of
their
craft
in
any
art
the
learner
who
wishes
to
do
good
work
does
well
to
associate
himself
with
master
workmen
and
i
attribute
much
of
the
success
which
is
recorded
in
this
volume
to
my
having
been
frequently
under
the
guidance
of
the
best
mountaineers
of
the
time
the
hints
and
observations
which
are
dispersed
throughout
the
volume
are
not
the
result
of
personal
experience
only
they
have
been
frequently
derived
from
professional
mountaineers
who
have
studied
the
art
from
their
youth
upwards
without
being
unduly
discursive
in
the
narrative
it
has
not
been
possible
to
include
in
the
text
all
the
observations
which
are
desirable
for
the
general
reader
and
a
certain
amount
of
elementary
knowledge
has
been
which
perhaps
some
do
not
possess
and
the
opportunity
is
now
taken
of
making
a
few
remarks
which
may
serve
to
elucidate
those
which
follow
when
a
man
who
is
not
a
born
mountaineer
gets
upon
the
side
of
a
mountain
he
speedily
finds
out
that
walking
is
an
art
and
very
soon
wishes
that
he
could
be
a
quadruped
or
a
centipede
or
anything
except
a
biped
but
as
there
is
a
difficulty
in
satisfying
these
very
natural
desires
he
ultimately
procures
an
alpenstock
and
turns
himself
into
a
tripod
this
simple
implement
is
invaluable
to
the
mountaineer
and
when
he
is
parted
from
it
involuntarily
and
who
has
not
been
he
is
inclined
to
say
just
as
one
may
remark
of
other
friends

were
only
a

were
a
true
friend

point
of
alpenstock
respecting
the
size
of
the
alpenstock
let
it
be
remarked
that
it
may
be
nearly
useless
if
it
be
too
long
or
too
short
it
should
always
be
shorter
than
the
person
who
carries
it
but
it
may
be
any
length
you
like
between
of
your
height
and
your
extreme
altitude
it
should
be
made
of
ash
of
the
very
best
quality
and
should
support
your
weight
upon
its
centre
when
it
is
suspended
at
its
two
ends
unless
shod
with
an
iron
point
it
can
scarcely
be
termed
an
alpenstock
and
the
nature
of
the
point
is
of
some
importance
the
kind
i
prefer
is
shown
in
the
annexed
illustration
it
has
a
long
tang
running
into

wood

supported
by
a
rivetted
collar
and
its
termination
is
extremely
sharp
with
a
point
of
this
description
steps
can
be
made
in
ice
almost
as
readily
as
with
an
axe
a
volume
might
be
written
upon
the
use
of
the
alpenstock
its
principal
use
is
as
a
third
leg
to
extend
one
s
base
line
and
when
the
beginner
gets
this
well
into
his
head
he
finds
the
implement
of
extraordinary
value
in
these
latter
times
the
pure
and
simple
alpenstock
has
gone
out
of
fashion
and
mountaineers
now
almost
universally
carry
a
stick
with
a
point
at
one
end
and
an
at
the
other
a
moveable
is
still
a
desideratum
there
is
a
made
at
birmingham
with
a
moveable
head
which
is
better
than
any
other
kind
that
i
have
seen
but
the
head
is
too
clumsy
to
be
held
in
the
hand
and
various
improvements
will
have
to
be
effected
in
it
before
it
will
be
fit
for
use
in
mountaineering
still
its
principle
appears
to
me
to
be
capable
of
adaptation
and
on
that
account
i
have
introduced
it

has
been

on
this
subject
in
different
parts
of
the
narrative
as
well
as
in
regard
to
tents
few
other
articles
are
though
many
others
are
to
carry
about
and
amongst
the
most
important
may
be
reckoned
some
simple
means
of
boiling
water
and
cooking

considerable
altitudes
above

it
is
frequently
impossible
to
carry
up

nothing

and
convenient

the
most
compact
form
of

that
i
know
and
wonders
can
be
effected
with

is

those
figured
here

are
constructed

the
cooking
can
be
done
that
the
alpine
tourist
requires
for
prolonged
expeditions
of
a
serious
nature
a
more
elaborate
equipage
is
necessary
but
upon
such
small
ones
as
are
made
in
the
alps

to

unprotected

that

should

upon
the
important
subject
of
boots
much
might
be
written
my
friends
are
generally
surprised
to
find
that
i
use
boots
whilst
mountaineering
and
condemn
them
under
the
false
impression
that
they
will
not
give
support
to
the
ankles
and
will
be
pulled
off
when
one
is
traversing
deep
snow
i
have
invariably
used
boots
on
my
mountain
expeditions
in
the
alps
and
elsewhere
and
have
found
that
they
give
sufficient
support
to
the
ankles
and
never
draw
off
my
alpine
boots
have
always
been
made
by
maker
who
knows
what
the
requirements
are
and
one
who
will
give
a
good
boot
if
allowed
good
time
it
is
fully
as
important
to
have
proper
nails
in
the
boots
as
it
is
to
have
good
boots

quantity
is
frequently
overdone
and
when
there
are
too
many
they
are
absolutely
dangerous
which
may
be
considered
a
variety
of

are
an
abomination
the
nails
should
be
neither
too
large
nor
too
numerous
and
they
should
be
disposed

disappear

by
one
from
time
to
time

mountaineer
continually
examines
his
boots
to
see
that
sufficient
numbers
are
left
a
handkerchief
tied
round
the
foot
or
even
a
few
turns
of
cord
will
afford
a
tolerable
substitute
when
nails
can
not
be
procured
if
the
beginner
supplies
himself
with
the
articles
which
have
been
named
he
will
be
in
possession
of
all
the
gear
which
is
for
ordinary
mountain
excursions
and
if
he
uses
his
plant
properly
he
will
avoid
many
of
the
disagreeables
which
are
looked
upon
by
some
as
almost
unavoidable
accompaniments
of
the
sport
of
mountaineering
i
have
not
throughout
the
volume
ignored
the
dangers
which
are
real
and
unavoidable
and
say
distinctly
that
too
great
watchfulness
can
not
be
exercised
at
great
altitudes
but
i
say
now
as
i
have
frequently
said
before
that
the
great
majority
of
accidents
which
occur
to
mountaineers
especially
to
mountaineering
amateurs
in
the
alps
are
not
the
result
of
unavoidable
dangers
and
that
they
are
for
the
most
part
the
product
of
ignorance
and
neglect
i
consider
that
falling
rocks
are
the
greatest
danger
which
a
mountaineer
is
likely
to
encounter
and
in
concluding
these
prefatory
remarks

chapter
i
on
the
of
july
i
started
for
my
first
tour
in
the
alps
as
we
steamed
out
into
the
channel
beachy
head
came
into
view
and
recalled
a
scramble
of
many
years
ago
with
the
impudence
of
ignorance
my
brother
and
i
schoolboys
both
had
tried
to
scale
that
great
chalk
cliff
not
the
head
circle
and
where
the
flints
are
ranged
so
orderly
in
parallel
at
a
place
more
to
the
east
where
the
pinnacle
called
the
devil
s
chimney
had
fallen
down
since
that
time
we
have
been
often
in
dangers
of
different
kinds
but
never
have
we
more
nearly
broken
our
necks
than
upon
that
occasion
in
paris
i
made
two
ascents
the
first
to
the
seventh
floor
of
a
house
in
the
quartier
an
artist
friend
who
was
engaged
at
the
moment
of
my
entry
in
combat
with
a
little
jew
he
hurled
him
with
great
and
with
considerable
force
into
some
of
his
crockery
and
then
recommended
me
to
go
up
the
towers
of
notre
dame
later
i
stood
on
the
parapet
of
the
great
west
front
by
the
side
of
the
leering
fiend
which
for
centuries
has
looked
down
upon
the
great
city
and
then
took
rail
to
switzerland
saw
the
sunlight
lingering
on
the
giants
of
the
oberland
heard
the
echoes
from
the
in
the
lauterbrunnen
valley
and
the
avalanches
rattling
off
the
jungfrau
and
crossed
the
gemmi
into
the
valais
illustration
the
devil
of
notre
dame
i
was
bound
for
the
valley
of
saas
and
my
work
took
me
high
up
the
alps
on
either
side
far
beyond
the
limit
of
trees
and
the
tracks
of
tourists
the
view
from
the
slopes
of
the
weissmies
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
valley
or
feet
above
the
village
of
saas
is
perhaps
the
finest
of
its
kind
in
the
alps
the
full
height
of
the
mischabel
the
highest
mountain
in
switzerland
is
seen
at
one
glance
feet
of
dense
forests
green
alps
rocky
pinnacles
and
glittering
glaciers
the
peaks
seemed
to
me
then
to
be
hopelessly
inaccessible
from
this
direction
i
next
descended
the
valley
to
the
village
of
stalden
and
went
up
the
visp
thal
to
zermatt
and
stopped
there
several
days
numerous
traces
of
the
formidable
of
five
years
before
still
remained
particularly
at
nicholas
where
the
inhabitants
had
been
terrified
beyond
measure
at
the
destruction
of
their
churches
and
houses
at
this
place
as
well
as
at
visp
a
large
part
of
the
population
was
obliged
to
live
under
canvas
for
several
months
it
is
remarkable
that
there
was
hardly
a
life
lost
on
this
occasion
although
there
were
about
fifty
shocks
some
of
which
were
very
severe
at
zermatt
i
wandered
in
many
directions
but
the
weather
was
bad
and
my
work
was
much
retarded
one
day
after
spending
a
long
time
in
attempts
to
sketch
near
the
h√∂rnli
and
in
futile
endeavours
to
seize
the
forms
of
the
peaks
as
they
for
a
few
seconds
peered
out
from
above
the
dense
banks
of
woolly
clouds
i
determined
not
to
return
to
zermatt
by
the
usual
path
and
to
cross
the
gorner
glacier
to
the
riffel
hotel
after
a
rapid
scramble
over
the
polished
rocks
and
snowbeds
which
skirt
the
base
of
the
th√©odule
glacier
and
wading
through
some
of
the
streams
which
flow
from
it
at
that
time
much
swollen
by
the
late
rains
the
first
difficulty
was
arrived
at
in
the
shape
of
a
precipice
about
three
hundred
feet
high
it
seemed
that
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
cross
the
glacier
if
the
cliff
could
be
descended
but
higher
up
and
lower
down
the
ice
appeared
to
my
inexperienced
eyes
to
be
impassable
for
a
single
person
the
general
contour
of
the
cliff
was
nearly
perpendicular
but
it
was
a
good
deal
broken
up
and
there
was
little
difficulty
in
descending
by
zigzagging
from
one
mass
to
another
at
length
there
was
a
long
slab
nearly
smooth
fixed
at
an
angle
of
about
forty
degrees
between
two
pieces
of
rock
nothing
except
the
glacier
could
be
seen
below
it
was
an
awkward
place
but
i
passed
it
at
length
by
lying
across
the
slab
putting
the
shoulders
stiffly
against
one
side
and
the
feet
against
the
other
and
gradually
wriggling
down
by
first
moving
the
legs
and
then
the
back
when
the
bottom
of
the
slab
was
gained
a
friendly
crack
was
seen
into
which
the
point
of
the
baton
could
be
stuck
and
i
dropped
down
to
the
next
piece
it
took
a
long
time
coming
down
that
little
bit
of
cliff
and
for
a
few
seconds
it
was
satisfactory
to
see
the
ice
close
at
hand
in
another
moment
a
second
difficulty
presented
itself
the
glacier
swept
round
an
angle
of
the
cliff
and
as
the
ice
was
not
of
the
nature
of
treacle
or
thin
putty
it
kept
away
from
the
little
bay
on
the
edge
of
which
i
stood
we
were
not
widely
separated
but
the
edge
of
the
ice
was
higher
than
the
opposite
edge
of
rock
and
worse
the
rock
was
covered
with
loose
earth
and
stones
which
had
fallen
from
above
all
along
the
side
of
the
cliff
as
far
as
could
be
seen
in
both
directions
the
ice
did
not
touch
it
but
there
was
this
marginal
crevasse
seven
feet
wide
and
of
unknown
depth
all
this
was
seen
at
a
glance
and
almost
at
once
i
concluded
that
i
could
not
jump
the
crevasse
and
began
to
try
along
the
cliff
lower
down
but
without
success
for
the
ice
rose
higher
and
higher
until
at
last
further
progress
was
stopped
by
the
cliffs
becoming
perfectly
smooth
with
an
axe
it
would
have
been
possible
to
cut
up
the
side
of
the
ice
without
one
i
saw
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
return
and
face
the
jump
night
was
approaching
and
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
high
alps
was
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
rushing
water
or
of
falling
rocks
if
the
jump
should
be
successful
if
not
i
fell
into
that
horrible
chasm
to
be
frozen
in
or
drowned
in
that
gurgling
rushing
water
everything
depended
on
that
jump
again
i
asked
myself
can
it
be
done
it
be
so
finding
my
stick
was
useless
i
threw
it
and
the
to
the
ice
and
first
retreating
as
far
as
possible
ran
forward
with
all
my
might
took
the
leap
barely
reached
the
other
side
and
fell
awkwardly
on
my
knees
the
glacier
was
crossed
without
further
trouble
but
the
riffel
which
was
then
a
very
small
building
was
crammed
with
tourists
and
could
not
take
me
in
as
the
way
down
was
unknown
to
me
some
of
the
people
obligingly
suggested
getting
a
man
at
the
chalets
otherwise
the
path
would
be
certainly
lost
in
the
forest
on
arriving
at
the
chalets
no
man
could
be
found
and
the
lights
of
zermatt
shining
through
the
trees
seemed
to
say
never
mind
a
guide
but
come
along
down
i
ll
show
you
the
way
so
off
i
went
through
the
forest
going
straight
towards
them
the
path
was
lost
in
a
moment
and
was
never
recovered
i
was
tripped
up
by
tumbled
over
rhododendron
bushes
fell
over
rocks
the
night
was
pitch
dark
and
after
a
time
the
lights
of
zermatt
became
obscure
or
went
out
altogether
by
a
series
of
slides
or
falls
or
evolutions
more
or
less
disagreeable
the
descent
through
the
forest
was
at
length
accomplished
but
torrents
of
formidable
character
had
still
to
be
passed
before
one
could
arrive
at
zermatt
i
felt
my
way
about
for
hours
almost
hopelessly
by
an
exhaustive
process
at
last
discovering
a
bridge
and
about
midnight
covered
with
dirt
and
scratches
the
inn
which
i
had
quitted
in
the
morning
illustration
the
church
in
difficulties
others
besides
tourists
get
into
difficulties
a
day
or
two
afterwards
when
on
the
way
to
my
old
station
near
the
h√∂rnli
i
met
a
stout
cur√©
who
had
essayed
to
cross
the
th√©odule
pass
his
strength
or
his
wind
had
failed
and
he
was
being
carried
down
a
helpless
bundle
and
a
ridiculous
spectacle
on
the
back
of
a
lanky
guide
while
the
peasants
stood
by
with
folded
hands
their
reverence
for
the
church
almost
overcome
by
their
sense
of
the
ludicrous
i
descended
the
valley
diverging
from
the
path
at
randa
to
mount
the
slopes
of
the
dom
in
order
to
see
the
weisshorn
face
to
face
the
latter
mountain
is
the
noblest
in
switzerland
and
from
this
direction
it
looks
especially
magnificent
on
its
north
there
is
a
large
snowy
plateau
that
feeds
the
glacier
of
which
a
portion
is
seen
from
randa
and
which
on
more
than
one
occasion
has
destroyed
that
village
from
the
direction
of
the
dom

not

it

very
steep
its

less

clings
in

arriving

more
in
the
rhone
valley
i
proceeded
to
viesch
and
from
thence
ascended
the
eggischorn
on
which
unpleasant
eminence
i
lost
my
way
in
a
fog
and
my
temper
shortly
afterwards
then
after
crossing
the
grimsel
in
a
severe
thunderstorm
passed

of

were
a
welcome
sight
as
i
waded
through
the
near
the
summit
of
the
pass
and
pleasant
also
was
the
courteous
salutation
of
the
brother
who
bade
me
enter
he
wondered
at
the
weight
of
my
knapsack
and
i
at
the
hardness
of
his
bread
the
saying
that
the
monks
make
the
toast
in
the
winter
that
they
give
to
tourists
in
the
following
season
is
not
founded
on
truth
the
winter
is
their
most
busy
time
of
the
year
but
it
true
they
have
exercised
so
much
hospitality
that
at
times
they
have
not
possessed
the
means
to
furnish
the
fuel
for
heating
their
chapel
in
the
winter
instead
of
descending
to
aosta
i
turned
aside
into
the
val
pelline
in
order
to
obtain
views
of
the
dent
d
erin
the
night
had
come
on
before
biona
was
gained
and
i
had
to
knock
long
and
loud
upon
the
door
of
the
cur√©
s
house
before
it
was
opened
an
old
woman
with
querulous
voice
and
with
a
large
go√Ætre
answered
the
summons
and
demanded
rather
sharply
what
was
wanted
but
became
a
piece
was
held
in
her
face
and
she
heard
that
lodging
and
supper
were
requested
in
exchange

the
village
of
biona
my
directions
asserted
that
a
passage
existed
from
prerayen
at
the
head
of
this
valley
to
breil
in
the
val
tournanche
and
the
old
woman
now
convinced
of
my
respectability
busied
herself
to
find
a
guide
presently
she
introduced
a
native
picturesquely
attired
in
hat
braided
jacket
scarlet
waistcoat
and
indigo
pantaloons
who
agreed
to
take
me
to
the
village
of
val
tournanche
we
set
off
early
on
the
next
morning
and
got
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
without
difficulty
it
gave
me
my
first
experience
of
considerable
slopes
of
hard
steep
snow
and
like
all
beginners
i
endeavoured
to
prop
myself
up
with
my
stick
and
kept
it
instead
of
holding
it
between
myself
and
the
slope
and
leaning
upon
it
as
should
have
been
done
the
man
enlightened
me
but
he
had
properly
a
very
small
opinion
of
his
employer
and
it
is
probably
on
that
account
that
a
few
minutes
after
we
had
passed
the
summit
he
said
he
would
not
go
any
further
and
would
return
to
biona
all
argument
was
useless
he
stood
still
and
to
everything
that
was
said
answered
nothing
but
that
he
would
go
back
being
rather
nervous
about
descending
some
long
which
still
intervened
between
us
and
the
head
of
the
valley
i
offered
more
pay
and
he
went
on
a
little
way
presently
there
were
some
cliffs
down
which
we
had
to
scramble
he
called
to
me
to
stop
then
shouted
that
he
would
go
back
and
beckoned
to
me
to
come
up
on
the
contrary
i
waited
for
him
to
come
down
but
instead
of
doing
so
in
a
second
or
two
he
turned
round
clambered
deliberately
up
the
cliff
and
vanished
i
supposed
it
was
only
a
ruse
to
extort
offers
of
more
money
and
waited
for
but
he
did
not
appear
again
this
was
rather
embarrassing
for
he
carried
off
my
knapsack
the
choice
of
action
lay
between
chasing
him
and
going
on
to
breil
risking
the
loss
of
my
knapsack
i
chose
the
latter
course
and
got
to
breil
the
same
evening
the
landlord
of
the
inn
suspicious
of
a
person
entirely
innocent
of
luggage
was
doubtful
if
he
could
admit
me
and
eventually
thrust
me
into
a
kind
of
loft
which
was
already
occupied
by
guides
and
by
hay
in
later
years
we
became
good
friends
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
give
credit
and
even
to
advance
considerable
sums
my
sketches
from
breil
were
made
under
difficulties
for
my
materials
had
been
carried
off
nothing
better
than
fine
could
be
obtained
and
the
pencils
seemed
to
contain
more
silica
than
plumbago
however
they
made
and
the
pass
was
again
crossed
this
time
alone
by
the
following
evening
the
old
woman
of
biona
again
produced
the
faithless
guide
the
knapsack
was
recovered
after
the
lapse
of
several
hours
and
then
i
poured
forth
all
the
terms
of
abuse
and
reproach
of
which
i
was
master
the
man
smiled
when
called
a
liar
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
referred
to
as
a
thief
but
drew
his
knife
when
spoken
of

a
long
and
weary
day
had
ended
when
paesana
was
reached
the

was
full
and
i
was
tired
and
about
to
go
to
bed
when
some
village
stragglers
entered
and
began
to
sing
they
sang
to
garibaldi
the
tenor
a
ragged
fellow
whose
clothes
were
not
worth
a
shilling
took
the
lead
with
wonderful
expression
and
feeling
the
others
kept
their
places
and
sang
in
admirable
time
for
hours
i
sat
enchanted
and
long
after
i
retired
the
sound
of
their
melody
could
be
heard
relieved
at
times
by
the
treble
of
the
girl
who
belonged
to
the
inn
the
next
morning
i
passed
the
little
lakes
which
are
the
sources
of
the
po
on
my
way
into
france
the
weather
was
stormy
and
misinterpreting
the
patois
of
some
in
reality
pointed
out
the
right
missed
the
track
and
found
myself
under
the
cliffs
of
monte
viso
a
gap
that
was
occasionally
seen
in
the
ridge
connecting
it
with
the
mountains
to
the
east
tempted
me
up
and
after
a
battle
with
a
of
excessive
steepness
i
reached
the
summit
the
scene
was
extraordinary
and
in
my
experience
unique
to
the
north
there
was
not
a
particle
of
mist
and
the
violent
wind
coming
from
that
direction
blew
one
back
staggering
but
on
the
side
of
italy
the
valleys
were
completely
filled
with
dense
masses
of
cloud
to
a
certain
level
and
they
felt
the
influence
of
the
were
cut
off
as
level
as
the
top
of
a
table
the
ridges
appearing
above
them
i
raced
down
to
abries
and
went
on
through
the
gorge
of
the
guil
to
mont
dauphin
the
next
day
found
me
at
la
bess√©e
at
the
junction
of
the
val
louise
with
the
valley
of
the
durance
in
full
view
of
mont
pelvoux
and
by
chance
i
walked
into
a
cabaret
where
a
frenchman
was
breakfasting
who
a
few
days
before
had
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
ascend
that
mountain
with
three
englishmen
and
the
guide
michel
croz
of
chamounix
a
right
good
fellow
by
name
jean
reynaud
the
same
night
i
slept
at
brian√ßon
intending
to
take
the
courier
on
the
following
day
to
grenoble
but
all
places
had
been
secured
several
days
beforehand
so
i
set
out
at
two
on
the
next
day
for
a
walk
the
weather
was
again
bad
and
on
the
summit
of
the
col
de
lautaret
i
was
forced
to
seek
shelter
in
the
wretched
little
hospice
it
was
filled
with
workmen
who
were
employed
on
the
road
and
with
noxious
vapours
which
proceeded
from
them
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
was
preferable
to
the
inhospitality
of
the
interior
outside
it
was
disagreeable
but
grand
inside
it
was
disagreeable
and
mean
the
walk
was
continued
under
a
deluge
of
rain
and
i
felt
the
way
intense
was
the
the
village
of
la
grave
where
the
people
of
the
inn
detained
me
forcibly
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
that
they
did
so
for
during
that
night
blocks
of
rock
fell
at
several
places
from
the
cliffs
on
to
the
road
with
such
force
that
they
made
large
pits
in
the
macadam
i
resumed
the
walk
at
five
the
next
morning
and
proceeded
under
steady
rain
through
bourg
d
oysans
to
grenoble
arriving
at
the
latter
place
soon
after
seven
having
accomplished
the
entire
distance
from
brian√ßon
in
about
eighteen
hours
of
actual
walking
this
was
the
end
of
the
alpine
portion
of
my
tour
of
on
which
i
was
introduced
to
the
great
peaks
and
acquired
the
passion
for
the
development
of
which
is

fortune
on
our
first
endeavour
virgil
the
district
of
which
mont
pelvoux
and
the
neighbouring
summits
are
the
culminating
points
is
both
historically
and
topographically
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
alps
as
the
nursery
and
the
home
of
the
vaudois
it
has
claims
to
permanent
attention
the
names
of
waldo
and
of
neff
will
be
remembered
when
men
more
famous
in
their
time
will
be
forgotten
and
the
memory
of
the
heroic
courage
and
the
simple
piety
of
their
disciples
will
endure
as
long
as
history
lasts
this
district
contains
the
highest
summits
in
france
and
some
of
its
finest
scenery
it
has
not
perhaps
the
beauties
of
switzerland
but
has
charms
of
its
own
its
cliffs
its
torrents
and
its
gorges
are
unsurpassed
its
deep
and
savage
valleys
present
pictures
of
grandeur
and
even
sublimity
and
it
is
second
to
none
in
the
boldness
of
its
mountain
forms
the
district
includes
a
mass
of
valleys
which
vie
with
each
other
in
singularity
of
character
and
dissimilarity
of
climate
some
the
rays
of
the
sun
can
never
reach
they
are
so
deep
and
narrow
in
others
the
very
antipodes
may
be
found
the
temperature
more
like
that
of
the
plains
of
italy
than
of
alpine
france
this
great
range
of
climate
has
a
marked
effect
on
the
flora
of
these
valleys
sterility
reigns
in
some
stones
take
the
place
of
trees
d√©bris
and
mud
replace
plants
and
flowers
in
others
in
the
space
of
a
few
miles
one
passes
vines
apple
pear
and
cherry
trees
the
birch
alder
walnut
ash
larch
and
pine
alternating
with
fields
of
rye
barley
oats
beans
and
potatoes
the
valleys
are
for
the
most
part
short
and
erratic
they
are
not
apparently
arranged
on
any
definite
plan
they
are
not
disposed
as
is
frequently
the
case
elsewhere
either
at
right
angles
to
or
parallel
with
the
highest
summits
but
they
wander
hither
and
thither
take
one
direction
for
a
few
miles
then
double
back
and
then
perhaps
resume
their
original
course
thus
long
perspectives
are
rarely
to
be
seen
and
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
general
idea
of
the
disposition
of
the
peaks
the
highest
summits
are
arranged
almost
in
a
form
the
highest
of
all
which
occupies
a
central
position
is
the
pointe
des
ecrins
the
second
in
height
the
meije
is
on
the
north
and
the
mont
pelvoux
which
gives
its
name
to
the
entire
block
stands
almost
detached
by
itself
on
the
outside
the
district
is
still
very
imperfectly
known
there
are
probably
many
valleys
and
there
are
certainly
many
summits
which
have
never
been
trodden
by
the
feet
of
tourists
or
travellers
but
in
it
was
even
less
known
until
quite
recently
there
was
practically
no
map
of
it
general
bourcet
s
which
was
the
best
that
was
published
was
completely
wrong
in
its
delineation
of
the
mountains
and
was
frequently
incorrect
in
regard
to
paths
or
roads
the
mountainous
regions
of
dauphin√©
moreover
are
not
supplied
like
switzerland
tyrol
or
even
the
italian
valleys
with
accommodation
for
travellers
the
inns
when
they
exist
are
often
filthy
beyond
description
rest
is
seldom
obtained
in
their
beds
or
decent
food
found
in
their
kitchens
and
there
are
no
local
guides
worth
having
the
tourist
is
thrown
very
much
on
his
own
resources
and
it
is
not
therefore
surprising
that
these
districts
are
less
visited
and
less
known
than
the
rest
of
the
alps
most
of
the
statements
current
in
respecting
these
mountains
had
been
derived
from
two
authors
elie
de
beaumont
and
the
late
principal
forbes
their
works
however
contained
numerous
errors
in
regard
to
the
identification
of
the
peaks
and
amongst
others
they
referred
the
supremacy
to
the
mont
pelvoux
the
highest
point
of
which
they
termed
the
pointe
des
arcines
or
des
ecrins
principal
forbes
erroneously
identified
the
high
peak
seen
from
the
valley
of
christophe
with
that
seen
from
the
valley
of
the
durance
and
spoke
of
both
as
the
mont
pelvoux
and
de
beaumont
committed
similar
mistakes
in
point
of
fact
at
the
time
when
de
beaumont
and
forbes
wrote
their
respective
memoirs
the
proper
relation
of
the
mont
pelvoux
to
the
neighbouring
summits
had
been
determined
by
the
engineers
employed
on
the
survey
for
the
map
of
france
but
their
observations
were
not
then
accessible
to
the
public
although
they
had
evidently
been
seen
by
de
beaumont
this
party
of
surveyors
led
by
captain
durand
made
the
ascent
of
mont
pelvoux
from
the
side
of
the
val
d
is
from
the
direction
of
val
according
to
the
natives
of
the
val
louise
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
second
peak
in
height
and
remained
upon
it
lodged
in
a
tent
for
several
days
at
a
height
of
feet
they
took
numerous
porters
to
carry
wood
for
fires
and
erected
a
large
cairn
on
the
summit
which
has
caused
the
name
of
pic
de
la
pyramide
to
be
given
to
their
summit
in
puiseux
made
the
ascent
from
the
same
direction
but
his
val
louisan
guide
stopped
short
of
the
summit
and
allowed
this
courageous
astronomer
to
proceed
by
himself
in
the
middle
of
august
bonney
hawkshaw
and
mathews
with
michel
croz
of
chamounix
tried
to
ascend
the
pelvoux
likewise
from
the
same
direction

gentlemen
spent

and
nights
upon
the

jean
reynaud
of
whom
mention
has
been
made
in
the
preceding
chapter
accompanied
the
party
of
mathews
and
he
was
of
opinion
that
the
attempt
had
been
made
too
late
in
the
season
he
said
that
the
weather
was
usually
good
enough
for
high
mountain
ascents
during
the
last
few
days
of
july
and
the
first
ones
of
august
and
suggested
that
we
should
attempt
to
ascend
the
mountain
in
the
following
year
at
that
time
the
proposition
was
a
tempting
one
and
reynaud
s
cordial
and
modest
manner
made
it
irresistible
although
there
seemed
small
chance
that
we
should
succeed
where
a
party
such
as
that
of
mathews
had
been
beaten
at
the
beginning
of
july
i
despatched
to
reynaud
from
havre
blankets
which
were
taxed
as
prohibited
fabrics
rope
and
other
things
desirable
for
the
excursion
and
set
out
on
the
tour
of
france
but
four
weeks
later
at
n√Æmes
found
myself
completely
collapsed
by
the
heat
then
faht
in
the
shade
and
took
a
night
train
at
once
to
grenoble
grenoble
is
a
town
upon
which
a
volume
might
be
written
its
situation
is
probably
the
finest
of
any
in
france
and
the
views
from
its
high
forts
are
superb
i
lost
my
way
in
the
streets
of
this
picturesque
and
noisome
town
and
having
but
a
left
in
which
to
get
a
dinner
and
take
a
place
in
the
diligence
was
not
well
pleased
to
hear
that
an
englishman
wished
to
see
me
it
turned
out
to
be
my
friend
macdonald
who
confided
to
me
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
ascend
a
mountain
called
pelvoux
in
the
course
of
ten
days
on
hearing
of
my
intentions
he
agreed
to
join
us
at
la
bess√©e
on
the
of
august
in
a
few
moments
more
i
was
perched
in
the
banquette
for
bourg
d
oysans
in
a
miserable
vehicle
which
took
nearly
eight
hours
to
accomplish
less
than
miles
at
five
on
a
lovely
morning
i
shouldered
my
knapsack
and
started
for
brian√ßon
gauzy
mists
clung
to
the
mountains
but
melted
away
when
touched
by
the
sun
and
disappeared
by
jerks
in
the
manner
of
views
when
focussed
in
a
magic
lantern
revealing
the
wonderfully
bent
and
folded
strata
in
the
limestone
cliffs
behind
the
town
then
i
entered
the
combe
de
malval
and
heard
the
romanche
eating
its
way
through
that
wonderful
gorge
and
passed
on
to
le
dauphin
where
the
first
glacier
came
into
view
tailing
over
the
on
the
right
from
this
place
until
the
summit
of
the
col
de
lautaret
was
passed
every
gap
in
the
mountains
showed
a
glittering
glacier
or
a
soaring
peak
the
finest
view
was
at
la
grave
where
the
meije
rises
by
a
series
of
tremendous
precipices
feet
above
the
road
the
finest
distant
view
of
the
pass
is
seen
after
crossing
the
col
near
mon√™tier
a
mountain
commonly
supposed
to
be
monte
viso
appears
at
the
end
of
the
vista
shooting
into
the
sky
in
the
middle
distance
but
still
ten
miles
off
is
brian√ßon
with
its
interminable
forts
and
in
the
foreground
leading
down
to
the
guisane
and
rising
high
up
the
neighbouring
slopes
are
fertile
fields
studded
with
villages
and
church
spires
the
next
day
i
walked
over
from
brian√ßon
to
la
bess√©e
to
my
worthy
friend
jean
reynaud
the
surveyor
of
roads
of
his
district
all
the
peaks
of
mont
pelvoux
are
well
seen
from
la
highest
point
as
well
as
that
upon
which
the
engineers
erected
their
cairn
neither
reynaud
nor
any
one
else
knew
this
the
natives
knew
only
that
the
engineers
had
ascended
one
peak
and
had
seen
from
that
one
a
still
higher
point
which
they
called
the
pointe
des
arcines
or
des
ecrins
they
could
not
say
whether
this
latter
could
be
seen
from
la
bess√©e
nor
could
they
tell
the
peak
upon
which
the
cairn
had
been
erected
we
were
under
the
impression
that
the
highest
point
was
concealed
by
the
peaks
which
we
saw
and
would
be
gained
by
passing
over
them
they
knew
nothing
of
the
ascent
of
monsieur
puiseux
and
they
confidently
asserted
that
the
highest
point
of
mont
pelvoux
had
not
been
attained
by
any
one
it
was
this
point
we
wished
to
reach
illustration
mont
pelvoux
from
above
la
bess√©e
nothing
prevented
our
starting
at
once
but
the
absence
of
macdonald
and
the
want
of
a
b√¢ton
reynaud
suggested
a
visit
to
the
postmaster
who
possessed
a
b√¢ton
of
local
celebrity
down
we
went
to
the
bureau
but
it
was
closed
we
halloed
through
the
slits
but
no
answer
at
last
the
postmaster
was
discovered
endeavouring
with
very
fair
success
to
make
himself
intoxicated
he
was
just
able
to
ejaculate
france
tis
the
first
nation
in
the
world
which
is
a
phrase
used
by
a
frenchman
at
times
when
a
briton
would
begin
to
shout
we
won
t
go
home
till
morning
glory
being
uppermost
in
the
thoughts
of
one
and
home
in
those
of
the
other
the
b√¢ton
was
produced
it
was
a
branch
of
a
young
oak
about
five
feet
long
gnarled
and
twisted
in
several
directions
sir
said
the
postmaster
as
he
presented
it
france
tis
the
first
nation
in
the
world
by
its
stuck
b√¢tons
i
suggested
yes
yes
sir
by
its
b√¢tons
by
and
here
he
could
not
get
on
at
all
as
i
looked
at
this
young
limb
i
thought
of
my
own
but
reynaud
who
knew
everything
about
everybody
in
the
village
said
there
was
not
a
better
one
so
off
we
went
with
it
leaving
the
official
staggering
in
the
road
and
muttering
france
tis
the
first
nation
in
the
world
the
of
august
came
and
macdonald
did
not
appear
so
we
started
for
the
val
louise
our
party
consisting
of
reynaud
myself
and
a
porter
jean
casimir
giraud
nicknamed
little
nails
the
shoemaker
of
the
place
an
hour
and
a
half
s
smart
walking
took
us
to
la
ville
de
val
louise
our
hearts
gladdened
by
the
glorious
peaks
of
pelvoux
shining
out
without
a
cloud
around
them
i
renewed
acquaintance
with
the
mayor
of
la
his
aspect
was
original
and
his
manners
were
gracious
but
the
odour
which
proceeded
from
him
was
dreadful
reynaud
kindly
undertook
to
look
after
the
commissariat
and
i
found
to
my
annoyance
when
we
were
about
to
leave
that
i
had
given
tacit
consent
to
a
small
being
carried
with
us
which
was
a
great
nuisance
from
the
commencement
it
was
excessively
awkward
to
handle
one
man
tried
to
carry
it
and
then
another
and
at
last
it
was
slung
from
one
of
our
b√¢tons
and
was
carried
by
two
of
us
which
gave
our
party
the
appearance
of
a
mechanical
diagram
to
illustrate
the
uses
of
levers
at
la
ville
the
val
louise
splits
into
two
val
d
entraigues
on
the
left
and
the
vallon
d
alefred
or
ailefroide
on
the
right
our
route
was
up
the
latter
and
we
moved
steadily
forwards
to
the
village
of
la
pisse
where
pierre
s√©miond
lived
who
was
reputed
to
know
more
about
the
pelvoux
than
any
other
man
he
looked
an
honest
fellow
but
unfortunately
he
was
ill
and
could
not
come
he
recommended
his
brother
an
aged
creature
whose
furrowed
and
wrinkled
face
hardly
seemed
to
announce
the
man
we
wanted
but
having
no
choice
we
engaged
him
and
again
set
forth
walnut
and
a
great
variety
of
other
trees
gave
shadow
to
our
path
and
fresh
vigour
to
our
limbs
while
below
in
a
sublime
gorge
thundered
the
torrent
whose
waters
took
their
rise
from
the
snows
we
hoped
to
tread
on
the
morrow
illustration
the
grand
pelvoux
de
val
louise
the
pelvoux
could
not
be
seen
at
la
ville
owing
to
a
high
intervening
ridge
we
were
now
moving
along
the
foot
of
this
to
get
to
the
ch√¢lets
of
alefred
or
as
they
are
sometimes
called
al√©froide
where
the
mountain
actually
commences
from
these
ch√¢lets
the
subordinate
but
more
proximate
peaks
appear
considerably
higher
than
the
loftier
ones
behind
and
sometimes
completely
conceal
them
but
the
whole
height
of
the
peak
which
in
these
valleys
goes
under
the
name
of
the
grand
pelvoux
is
seen
at
one
glance
from
its
summit
to
its
base
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
of
nearly
perpendicular
cliffs
the
ch√¢lets
of
alefred
are
a
cluster
of
miserable
wooden
huts
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
pelvoux
and
are
close
to
the
junction
of
the
streams
which
descend
from
the
glacier
de
sapeni√®re
or
du
sel√©
on
the
left
and
the
glaciers
blanc
and
noir
on
the
right
we
rested
a
minute
to
purchase
some
butter
and
milk
and
s√©miond
picked
up
a
lad
to
assist
in
carrying
pushing
and
otherwise
moving
the
our
route
now
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
all
were
glad
that
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
so
that
we
had
the
shadows
from
the
mountains
a
more
frightful
and
desolate
valley
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
it
contains
miles
of
boulders
d√©bris
stones
sand
and
mud
few
trees
and
they
placed
so
high
as
to
be
almost
out
of
sight
not
a
soul
inhabits
it
no
birds
are
in
the
air
no
fish
in
its
waters
the
mountain
is
too
steep
for
the
chamois
its
slopes
too
inhospitable
for
the
marmot
the
whole
too
repulsive
for
the
eagle
not
a
living
thing
did
we
see
in
this
sterile
and
savage
valley
during
four
days
except
some
few
poor
goats
which
had
been
driven
there
against
their
will
it
was
a
scene
in
keeping
with
the
diabolical
deed
perpetrated
here
about
four
hundred
years
murder
of
the
vaudois
of
val
louise
in
the
cavern
which
was
now
in
sight
though
high
above
us
their
story
is
very
sad
peaceful
and
industrious
for
more
than
three
centuries
they
had
inhabited
these
retired
valleys
in
tranquil
obscurity
the
archbishops
of
embrun
endeavoured
though
with
little
success
to
get
them
within
the
pale
of
their
church
their
efforts
were
aided
by
others
who
commenced
by
imprisonments
and
torture
and
at
last
adopted
the
method
of
burning
them
by
hundreds
at
the
stake
in
the
year
albert
cattan√©e
archdeacon
of
cremona
and
legate
of
pope
innocent
would
have
anticipated
the
barbarities
which
at
a
later
date
roused
the
indignation
of
milton
and
the
fears
of
cromwell
but
driven
everywhere
back
by
the
waldenses
of
piedmont
he
left
their
valleys
and
crossed
the
mont
gen√®vre
to
attack
the
weaker
and
more
thinly
populated
valleys
of
the
vaudois
in
dauphin√©
at
the
head
of
an
army
which
is
said
to
have
been
composed
of
vagabonds
robbers
and
assassins
who
had
been
tempted
to
his
banner
by
promises
of
absolution
beforehand
of
being
set
free
from
the
obligation
of
vows
which
they
might
have
made
and
by
the
confirmation
of
property
to
them
which
they
might
have
wrongfully
acquired
as
well
as
regular
troops
cattan√©e
poured
down
the
valley
of
the
durance
the
inhabitants
of
the
val
louise
fled
before
a
host
that
was
ten
times
their
number
and
took
up
their
abode
in
this
cavern
where
they
had
collected
provisions
sufficient
for
two
years
but
intolerance
is
ever
painstaking
their
retreat
was
discovered
cattan√©e
had
a
captain
who
combined
the
resources
of
a
herod
to
the
cruelty
of
a
pelissier
and
lowering
his
men
by
ropes
fired
piles
of
brushwood
at
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
suffocated
the
majority
and
slew
the
remainder
the
vaudois
were
relentlessly
exterminated
without
distinction
of
age
or
sex
more
than
three
thousand
persons
it
is
said
perished
in
this
frightful
massacre
the
growth
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
was
destroyed
at
one
blow
and
the
valley
was
completely
depopulated
louis
xii
caused
it
to
be
and
after
another
three
centuries
and
a
half
behold
the
race
of
monkeys
we
rested
a
little
at
a
small
spring
and
then
hastened
onwards
till
we
nearly
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
sapeni√®re
glacier
when
s√©miond
said
we
must
turn
to
the
right
up
the
slopes
this
we
did
and
clambered
for
through
scattered
firs
and
fallen
boulders
then
evening
began
to
close
in
rapidly
and
it
was
time
to
look
for
a
there
was
no
difficulty
in
getting
one
for
all
around
there
was
a
chaotic
assemblage
of
rocks
we
selected
the
under
side
of
a
boulder
which
was
more
than
fifty
feet
long
by
twenty
high
cleared
out
the
rubbish
and
then
collected
wood
for
a
fire
i
have
a
pleasant
recollection
of
that
the
had
got
through
all
its
troubles
it
was
tapped
and
the
frenchmen
seemed
to
derive
some
consolation
from
its
execrable
contents
reynaud
chanted
scraps
of
french
songs
and
each
contributed
his
share
of
joke
story
or
verse
the
weather
was
perfect
and
our
prospects
for
the
morrow
were
good
my
companions
joy
culminated
when
a
packet
of
red
fir
was
thrown
into
the
flames
it
hissed
and
bubbled
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
broke
out
into
a
grand
flare
the
effect
of
the
momentary
light
was
magnificent
the
mountains
all
around
were
illuminated
for
a
second
and
then
relapsed
into
their
solemn
gloom
one
by
one
our
party
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
at
last
i
got
into
my
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
although
we
were
at
a
height
of
at
least
feet
the
minimum
temperature
was
above
fahrenheit
we
roused
at
three
and
made
a
start
at
four
giraud
had
been
engaged
as
far
as
this
rock
only
but
as
he
wished
to
go
on
we
allowed
him
to
accompany
us
we
mounted
the
slopes
and
quickly
got
above
the
trees
then
had
a
couple
of
hours
clambering
over
bits
of
precipitous
rock
and
banks
of
d√©bris
and
at
a
quarter
to
seven
got
to
a
narrow
de
l
streamed
out
of
the
plateau
on
the
summit
and
nearly
reached
the
glacier
de
sapeni√®re
we
worked
as
much
as
possible
to
the
right
in
hopes
that
we
should
not
have
to
cross
it
but
were
continually
driven
back
and
at
last
we
found
that
over
we
must
go
old
s√©miond
had
a
strong
objection
to
the
ice
and
made
explorations
on
his
own
account
to
endeavour
to
avoid
it
but
reynaud
and
i
preferred
to
cross
it
and
giraud
stuck
to
us
it
was
fact
one
could
throw
a
stone
it
was
easily
mounted
on
the
side
but
in
the
centre
swelled
into
a
steep
dome
up
which
we
were
obliged
to
cut
giraud
stepped
forward
and
said
he
should
like
to
try
his
hand
and
having
got
hold
of
the
axe
would
not
give
it
up
and
here
as
well
as
afterwards
when
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
gullies
filled
with
hard
snow
which
abound
on
the
higher
part
of
the
mountain
he
did
all
the
work
and
did
it
admirably
old
s√©miond
of
course
came
after
us
when
we
got
across
we
then
zigzagged
up
some
and
shortly
afterwards
commenced
to
ascend
the
interminable
array
of
buttresses
which
are
the
great
peculiarity
of
the
pelvoux
they
were
very
steep
in
many
places
yet
on
the
whole
afforded
good
hold
and
no
climbing
should
be
called
difficult
which
does
that
gullies
abounded
among
them
sometimes
of
great
length
and
depth
were
frequently
rotten
and
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
single
man
to
pass
the
uppermost
men
were
continually
abused
for
dislodging
rocks
and
for
harpooning
those
below
with
their
b√¢tons
however
without
these
incidents
the
climbing
would
have
been
helped
to
break
the
monotony
we
went
up
chimneys
and
gullies
by
the
hour
together
and
always
seemed
to
be
coming
to
something
although
we
never
got
to
it
the
outline
sketch
will
help
to
explain
the
situation
we
stood
at
the
foot
of
a
great
about
feet
looked
up
it
did
not
go
to
a
point
as
in
the
diagram
because
we
could
not
see
the
top
although
we
felt
convinced
that
behind
the
fringe
of
pinnacles
we
did
see
there
was
a
top
and
that
was
the
edge
of
the
plateau
we
so
much
desired
to
attain
up
we
mounted
and
reached
the
pinnacles
but
lo
another
set
was
seen
another
yet
at
last
we
reached
the
top
and
found
it
was
only
a
buttress
and
that
we
must
descend
or
feet
before
we
could
commence
to
mount
again
when
this
operation
had
been
performed
a
few
dozen
times
it
began
to
be
wearisome
especially
as
we
were
in
the
dark
as
to
our
whereabouts
s√©miond
however
encouraged
us
and
said
he
knew
we
were
on
the
right
route
away
we
went
once
more
illustration
buttresses
of
mont
pelvoux
it
was
now
nearly
and
we
seemed
no
nearer
the
summit
of
the
pelvoux
than
when
we
started
at
last
we
all
joined
together
and
held
a
council
s√©miond
old
friend
do
you
know
where
we
are
now
oh
yes
perfectly
to
a
yard
and
a
well
then
how
much
are
we
below
this
plateau
he
affirmed
we
were
not
from
the
edge
of
the
snow
very
good
let
us
passed
and
then
another
but
we
were
still
in
the
same
state
buttresses
and
gullies
were
in
profusion
but
the
plateau
was
not
in
sight
so
we
called
him
he
had
been
staring
about
latterly
as
if
in
repeated
the
question
how
far
below
are
we
now
well
he
thought
it
might
be
more
but
you
said
that
just
now
are
you
sure
we
are
going
right
yes
he
believed
we
were
believed
that
would
not
do
are
you
sure
we
are
going
right
for
the
pic
des
arcines
pic
des
arcines
he
ejaculated
in
astonishment
as
if
he
had
heard
the
words
for
the
first
time
pic
des
arcines
no
but
for
the
pyramid
the
celebrated
pyramid
he
had
helped
the
great
capitaine
durand
here
was
a
fix
had
been
talking
about
it
to
him
for
a
whole
day
and
now
he
confessed
he
knew
nothing
about
it
i
turned
to
reynaud
who
seemed
thunderstruck
what
did
he
suggest
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
we
said
after
explaining
our
minds
pretty
freely
to
s√©miond
the
sooner
we
turn
back
the
better
for
we
have
no
wish
to
see
your
we
halted
for
an
hour
and
then
commenced
the
descent
it
took
us
nearly
seven
hours
to
come
down
to
our
rock
but
i
paid
no
heed
to
the
distance
and
do
not
remember
anything
about
it
when
we
got
down
we
made
a
discovery
which
affected
us
as
much
as
the
footprint
in
the
sand
did
robinson
crusoe
a
blue
silk
veil
lay
by
our
fireside
there
was
but
one
explanation
had
arrived
but
where
was
he
we
soon
packed
our
baggage
and
tramped
in
the
dusk
through
the
stony
desert
to
alefred
where
we
arrived
about
nine
where
is
the
englishman
was
the
first
question
he
was
gone
to
sleep
at
la
ville
we
passed
that
night
in
a
and
in
the
morning
after
settling
with
s√©miond
posted
down
to
catch
macdonald
we
had
already
determined
on
the
plan
of
operation
which
was
to
get
him
to
join
us
return
and
be
independent
of
all
guides
simply
taking
the
best
man
we
could
get
as
a
porter
i
set
my
heart
on
giraud
good
fellow
with
no
pretence
although
in
every
respect
up
to
the
work
we
were
disappointed
he
was
obliged
to
go
to
brian√ßon
the
walk
soon
became
exciting
the
natives
inquired
the
result
of
our
expedition
and
common
civility
obliged
us
to
stop
but
i
was
afraid
of
losing
my
man
for
it
was
said
he
would
wait
only
till
ten
o
clock
and
that
time
was
near
at
hand
at
last
i
dashed
over
the
bridge
from
alefred
an
hour
and
a
quarter
a
cantonnier
stopped
me
saying
that
the
englishman
had
just
started
for
la
bess√©e
i
rushed
after
him
turned
angle
after
angle
of
the
road
but
could
not
see
him
at
last
as
i
came
round
a
corner
he
was
also
just
turning
another
going
very
fast
i
shouted
and
luckily
he
heard
me
we
returned
reprovisioned
ourselves
at
la
ville
and
the
same
evening
saw
us
passing
our
first
rock
for
another
i
have
said
we
determined
to
take
no
guide
but
on
passing
la
pisse
old
s√©miond
turned
out
and
offered
his
services
he
went
well
in
spite
of
his
years
and
disregard
of
truth
why
not
take
him
said
my
friend
so
we
offered
him
a
fifth
of
his
previous
pay
and
in
a
few
seconds
he
closed
with
the
offer
this
time
he
came
in
an
inferior
position
were
to
lead
he
to
follow
our
second
follower
was
a
youth
of
years
who
was
not
all
that
could
be
desired
he
drank
reynaud
s
wine
smoked
our
cigars
and
quietly
secreted
the
provisions
when
we
were
nearly
starving
discovery
of
his
proceedings
did
not
at
all
disconcert
him
and
he
finished
up
by
getting
several
items
added
to
our
bill
at
la
ville
which
not
a
little
to
his
disgust
we
disallowed
this
night
we
fixed
our
camp
high
above
the
and
indulged
ourselves
in
the
healthy
employment
of
carrying
our
fuel
up
to
it
the
present
rock
was
not
so
comfortable
as
the
first
and
before
we
could
settle
down
we
were
obliged
to
turn
out
a
large
mass
which
was
in
the
way
it
was
very
obstinate
but
moved
at
length
slowly
and
gently
at
first
then
faster
and
faster
at
last
taking
great
jumps
in
the
air
striking
a
stream
of
fire
at
every
touch
which
shone
out
brightly
as
it
entered
the
gloomy
valley
below
and
long
after
it
was
out
of
sight
we
heard
it
bounding
downwards
and
then
settle
with
a
subdued
crash
on
the
glacier
beneath
as
we
turned
back
from
this
curious
sight
reynaud
asked
if
we
had
ever
seen
a
torrent
on
fire
and
told
us
that
in
the
spring
the
durance
swollen
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
sometimes
brings
down
so
many
rocks
that
where
it
passes
through
a
narrow
gorge
at
la
bess√©e
no
water
whatever
is
seen
but
only
boulders
rolling
over
and
over
grinding
each
other
into
powder
and
striking
so
many
sparks
that
the
stream
looks
as
if
it
were
on
fire
we
had
another
merry
evening
with
nothing
to
mar
it
the
weather
was
perfect
and
we
lay
backward
in
luxurious
repose
looking
at
the
sky
spangled
with
its
ten
thousand
brilliant
lights
the
ranges
stood
transfigured
in
the
silver
flood
their
snows
were
flashing
cold
and
keen
dead
white
save
where
some
sharp
ravine
took
shadow
or
the
sombre
green
of
hemlocks
turned
to
pitchy
black
against
the
whiteness
at
their
illustration
portrait
of
the
late
macdonald
macdonald
related
his
experiences
over
the
caf√©
noir
he
had
travelled
day
and
night
for
several
days
in
order
to
join
us
but
had
failed
to
find
our
first
bivouac
and
had
camped
a
few
hundred
yards
from
us
under
another
rock
higher
up
the
mountain
the
next
morning
he
discerned
us
going
along
a
ridge
at
a
great
height
above
him
and
as
it
was
useless
to
endeavour
to
overtake
us
he
lay
down
and
watched
with
a
heavy
heart
until
we
had
turned
the
corner
of
a
buttress
and
vanished
out
of
sight
nothing
but
the
heavy
breathing
of
our
already
sound
asleep
comrades
broke
the
solemn
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
a
silence
to
be
felt
nothing
hark
what
is
that
dull
booming
sound
above
us
is
that
nothing
there
it
is
again
it
comes
nearer
clearer
tis
a
crag
escaped
from
the
heights
above
what
a
fearful
crash
we
jump
to
our
feet
down
it
comes
with
awful
fury
what
power
can
withstand
its
violence
dancing
leaping
flying
dashing
against
others
roaring
as
it
descends
ah
it
has
passed
no
there
it
is
again
and
we
hold
our
breath
as
with
resistless
force
and
explosions
like
artillery
it
darts
past
with
an
avalanche
of
shattered
fragments
trailing
in
its
rear
tis
gone
and
we
breathe
more
freely
as
we
hear
the
finale
on
the
glacier
below
we
retired
at
last
but
i
was
too
excited
to
sleep
at
a
four
every
man
once
more
shouldered
his
pack
and
started
this
time
we
agreed
to
keep
more
to
the
right
to
see
if
it
were
not
possible
to
get
to
the
plateau
without
losing
any
time
by
crossing
the
glacier
to
describe
our
route
would
be
to
repeat
what
has
been
said
before
we
mounted
steadily
for
an
hour
and
a
half
sometimes
walking
though
more
frequently
climbing
and
then
found
after
all
that
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
glacier
the
part
on
which
we
struck
came
down
a
very
steep
slope
and
was
much
crevassed
the
word
crevassed
hardly
expresses
its
was
a
mass
of
formidable
s√©racs
we
found
however
more
difficulty
in
getting
on
than
across
it
and
thanks
to
the
rope
it
was
passed
in
safety
then
the
interminable
buttresses
began
again
hour
after
hour
we
proceeded
upwards
frequently
at
fault
and
obliged
to
descend
the
ridge
behind
us
had
sunk
long
ago
and
we
looked
over
it
and
all
others
till
our
eyes
rested
on
the
majestic
viso
hour
after
hour
passed
and
monotony
was
the
order
of
the
day
when
twelve
o
clock
came
we
lunched
and
contemplated
the
scene
with
satisfaction
all
the
summits
in
sight
with
the
single
exception
of
the
viso
had
given
in
and
we
looked
over
an
immense
perfect
sea
of
peaks
and
still
the
pinnacles
rose
above
us
and
opinions
were
freely
uttered
that
we
should
see
no
summit
of
pelvoux
that
day
old
s√©miond
had
become
a
perfect
bore
to
all
whenever
one
rested
for
a
moment
to
look
about
he
would
say
with
a
complacent
chuckle
don
t
be
afraid
follow
we
came
at
last
to
a
very
bad
piece
rotten
and
steep
and
no
hold
here
reynaud
and
macdonald
confessed
to
being
tired
and
talked
of
going
to
sleep
a
way
was
discovered
out
of
the
difficulty
then
some
one
called
out
look
at
the
viso
and
we
saw
that
we
almost
looked
over
it
we
worked
away
with
redoubled
energy
and
at
length
caught
sight
of
the
head
of
the
glacier
as
it
streamed
out
of
the
plateau
this
gave
us
fresh
hopes
we
were
not
deceived
and
with
a
simultaneous
shout
we
greeted
the
appearance
of
our
snows
a
large
crevasse
separated
us
from
them
but
a
bridge
was
found
we
tied
ourselves
in
line
and
moved
safely
over
it
directly
we
got
across
there
rose
before
us
a
fine
peak
old
s√©miond
cried
the
pyramid
i
see
the
pyramid
where
s√©miond
where
there
on
the
top
of
that
illustration
outline
to
show
route
up
mont
pelvoux
there
sure
enough
was
the
cairn
he
had
helped
to
erect
more
than
thirty
years
before
where
was
the
pic
des
arcines
which
we
were
to
see
it
was
nowhere
was
only
a
great
expanse
of
snow
bordered
by
three
lower
peaks
somewhat
sadly
we
moved
towards
the
pyramid
sighing
that
there
was
no
other
to
conquer
but
hardly
had
we
gone
two
hundred
paces
before
there
rose
a
superb
white
cone
on
the
left
which
had
been
hidden
before
by
a
slope
of
snow
we
shouted
the
pic
des
arcines
and
inquired
of
s√©miond
if
he
knew
whether
that
peak
had
been
ascended
as
for
him
he
knew
nothing
except
that
the
peak
before
us
was
called
the
pyramid
from
the
cairn
he
had
etc
and
that
it
had
not
been
ascended
since
all
right
about
and
we
immediately
turned
at
right
angles
for
the
cone
the
porter
making
faint
struggles
for
his
beloved
pyramid
our
progress
was
stopped
in
the
sixth
of
a
mile
by
the
edge
of
the
ridge
connecting
the
two
peaks
and
we
perceived
that
it
curled
over
in
a
lovely
volute
we
involuntarily
retreated
s√©miond
who
was
last
in
the
line
took
the
opportunity
to
untie
himself
and
refused
to
come
on
said
we
were
running
dangerous
risks
and
talked
vaguely
of
crevasses
we
tied
him
up
again
and
proceeded
the
snow
was
very
soft
we
were
always
and
sometimes
floundered
in
up
to
the
waist
but
a
simultaneous
jerk
before
and
behind
always
released
one
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
final
peak
the
ridge
seemed
easier
than
that
upon
which
we
stood
so
we
curved
round
to
get
to
it
some
rocks
peeped
out
feet
below
the
summit
and
up
these
we
crawled
leaving
our
porter
behind
as
he
said
he
was
afraid
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
as
we
went
off
to
turn
round
and
beckon
him
onwards
saying
don
t
be
me
but
he
did
not
answer
to
the
appeal
and
never
went
to
the
top
the
rocks
led
to
a
short
ridge
of
plateau
on
one
side
and
a
nearly
vertical
precipice
on
the
other
macdonald
cut
up
it
and
at
a
quarter
to
two
we
stood
shaking
hands
on
the
loftiest
summit
of
the
conquered
pelvoux
the
day
still
continued
everything
that
could
be
desired
and
far
and
near
countless
peaks
burst
into
sight
without
a
cloud
to
hide
them
the
mighty
mont
blanc
full
seventy
miles
away
first
caught
our
eyes
and
then
still
farther
off
the
monte
rosa
group
while
rolling
away
to
the
east
one
unknown
range
after
another
succeeded
in
unveiled
splendour
fainter
and
fainter
in
tone
but
still
perfectly
defined
till
at
last
the
eye
was
unable
to
distinguish
sky
from
mountain
and
they
died
away
in
the
horizon
monte
viso
rose
up
grandly
but
it
was
less
than
forty
miles
away
and
we
looked
over
it
to
a
hazy
mass
we
knew
must
be
the
plains
of
piedmont
southwards
a
blue
mist
seemed
to
indicate
the
existence
of
the
distant
mediterranean
to
the
west
we
looked
over
to
the
mountains
of
auvergne
such
was
the
panorama
a
view
extending
in
nearly
every
direction
for
more
than
one
hundred
miles
it
was
with
some
difficulty
we
wrenched
our
eyes
from
the
more
distant
objects
to
contemplate
the
nearer
ones
mont
dauphin
was
very
conspicuous
but
la
bess√©e
was
not
readily
perceived
besides
these
places
not
a
habitation
could
be
seen
all
was
rock
snow
or
ice
and
large
as
we
knew
were
the
of
dauphin√©
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
they
very
far
surpassed
our
most
ardent
imagination
nearly
in
a
line
between
us
and
the
viso
immediately
to
the
south
of
chateau
queyras
was
a
splendid
group
of
mountains
of
great
height
more
to
the
south
an
unknown
peak
seemed
still
higher
while
close
to
us
we
were
astonished
to
discover
that
there
was
a
mountain
which
appeared
even
higher
than
that
on
which
we
stood
at
least
this
was
my
opinion
macdonald
thought
that
it
was
not
so
high
and
reynaud
that
it
was
much
about
the
same
elevation
as
our
own
peak
this
mountain
was
distant
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
and
was
separated
from
us
by
a
tremendous
abyss
the
bottom
of
which
we
could
not
see
on
the
other
side
rose
this
mighty
peak
too
steep
for
snow
black
as
night
with
sharp
ridges
and
pointed
summit
we
were
in
complete
ignorance
of
its
whereabouts
for
none
of
us
had
been
on
the
other
side
we
imagined
that
la
b√©rarde
was
in
the
abyss
at
our
feet
although
it
was
in
reality
beyond
the
other
mountain
we
left
the
summit
at
last
and
descended
to
the
rocks
and
to
our
porter
where
i
boiled
some
water
obtained
by
melting
snow
after
we
had
fed
and
smoked
our
cigars
lighted
without
difficulty
from
a
common
match
we
found
it
was
ten
minutes
past
three
and
high
time
to
be
off
we
dashed
waded
and
tumbled
for
minutes
through
the
snow
and
then
began
the
long
descent
of
the
rocks
it
was
nearly
four
o
clock
and
as
it
would
be
dark
at
eight
it
was
evident
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
we
pushed
on
to
the
utmost
nothing
remarkable
occurred
going
down
we
kept
rather
closer
to
the
glacier
and
crossed
at
the
same
point
as
in
the
morning
getting
it
was
like
getting
awkward
old
s√©miond
had
got
had
reynaud
macdonald
came
next
but
as
he
made
a
long
stretch
to
get
on
to
a
higher
mass
he
slipped
and
would
have
been
in
the
bowels
of
a
crevasse
in
a
moment
had
he
not
been
tied
it
was
nearly
dark
by
the
time
we
had
crossed
yet
i
still
hoped
that
we
should
be
able
to
pass
the
night
at
our
rock
macdonald
was
not
so
sanguine
and
he
was
right
for
at
last
we
found
ourselves
quite
at
fault
and
wandered
helplessly
up
and
down
for
an
hour
while
reynaud
and
the
porter
indulged
in
a
little
mutual
abuse
the
dreary
fact
that
as
we
could
not
get
down
we
must
stay
where
we
were
was
now
quite
apparent
we
were
at
least
feet
high
and
if
it
commenced
to
rain
or
snow
as
the
gathering
clouds
and
rising
wind
seemed
to
threaten
we
might
be
in
a
sore
plight
we
were
hungry
having
eaten
little
since
and
a
torrent
we
heard
close
at
hand
but
could
not
discover
aggravated
our
thirst
s√©miond
endeavoured
to
get
some
water
from
it
although
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
he
was
wholly
unable
to
return
and
we
had
to
solace
him
by
shouting
at
intervals
through
the
night
a
more
detestable
locality
for
a
night
out
of
doors
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
there
was
not
shelter
of
any
kind
it
was
perfectly
exposed
to
the
chilly
wind
which
began
to
rise
and
it
was
too
steep
to
promenade
loose
rubbly
stones
covered
the
ground
and
had
to
be
removed
before
we
could
sit
with
any
comfort
this
was
an
advantage
although
we
hardly
thought
so
at
the
time
as
it
gave
us
some
employment
and
after
an
hour
s
active
exercise
of
that
interesting
kind
i
obtained
a
small
strip
about
nine
feet
long
on
which
it
was
possible
to
walk
reynaud
was
furious
at
first
and
soundly
abused
the
porter
whose
opinion
as
to
the
route
down
had
been
followed
rather
than
that
of
our
friend
and
at
last
settled
down
to
a
deep
dramatic
despair
and
wrung
his
hands
with
frantic
gesture
as
he
exclaimed
oh
malheur
malheur
oh
mis√©rables
thunder
commenced
to
growl
and
lightning
to
play
among
the
peaks
above
and
the
wind
which
had
brought
the
temperature
down
to
nearly
began
to
chill
us
to
the
bones
we
examined
our
resources
they
were
six
and
a
half
cigars
two
boxes
of
vesuvians
of
a
pint
of
and
of
spirits
of
wine
rather
scant
fare
for
three
fellows
who
had
to
get
through
seven
hours
before
daylight
the
was
lighted
and
the
remaining
spirits
of
wine
the
brandy
and
some
snow
were
heated
by
it
it
was
a
strong
liquor
and
we
wished
for
more
of
it
when
it
was
consumed
macdonald
endeavoured
to
dry
his
socks
by
the
lamp
and
then
the
three
lay
down
under
my
plaid
to
pretend
to
sleep
reynaud
s
woes
were
aggravated
by
toothache
macdonald
somehow
managed
to
close
his
eyes
the
longest
night
must
end
and
ours
did
at
last
we
got
down
to
our
rock
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
and
found
the
lad
not
a
little
surprised
at
our
absence
he
said
he
had
made
a
gigantic
fire
to
light
us
down
and
shouted
with
all
his
might
we
neither
saw
the
fire
nor
heard
his
shouts
he
said
we
looked
a
ghastly
crew
and
no
wonder
it
was
our
fourth
night
out
we
feasted
at
our
cave
and
performed
some
very
necessary
ablutions
the
persons
of
the
natives
are
infested
by
certain
agile
of
motion
numerous
and
voracious
it
is
dangerous
to
approach
too
near
and
one
has
to
study
the
wind
so
as
to
get
on
their
in
spite
of
all
such
precautions
my
unfortunate
companion
and
myself
were
being
rapidly
devoured
alive
we
only
expected
a
temporary
lull
of
our
tortures
for
the
interiors
of
the
inns
are
like
the
exteriors
of
the
natives
swarming
with
this
species
of
animated
creation
it
is
said
that
once
when
these
tormentors
were
filled
with
an
unanimous
desire
an
unsuspecting
traveller
was
dragged
bodily
from
his
bed
this
needs
confirmation
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
with
this
vile
subject
we
returned
from
our
ablutions
and
found
the
frenchmen
engaged
in
conversation
ah
said
old
s√©miond
as
to
fleas
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
different
to
anyone
else
have
this
time
he
certainly
spoke
the
truth
we
got
down
to
la
ville
in
good
time
and
luxuriated
there
for
several
days
played
many
games
of
bowls
with
the
natives
and
were
invariably
beaten
by
them
at
last
it
was
necessary
to
part
and
i
walked
to
abries
by
way
of
mont
dauphin
and
the
gorge
of
the
guil
towards
monte
viso
while
macdonald
went
to
brian√ßon
i
have
not
attempted
to
conceal
that
the
ascent
of
mont
pelvoux
is
of
a
rather
monotonous
character
the
view
from
its
summit
can
however
be
confidently
recommended
a
glance
at
a
map
will
show
that
with
the
single
exception
of
the
viso
whose
position
is
unrivalled
it
is
better
situated
than
any
other
mountain
of
considerable
height
for
viewing
the
whole
of
the
western
alps
our
discovery
that
the
peak
which
is
to
be
called
the
pointe
des
ecrins
was
a
separate
and
distinct
mountain
from
mont
not
its
highest
us
satisfaction
although
it
was
also
rather
of
the
nature
of
a
disappointment
on
our
return
to
la
bess√©e
we
wrongly
identified
it
with
the
peak
which
is
seen
from
thence
to
the
left
of
the
pelvoux
the
two
mountains
bear
a
considerable
resemblance
to
each
other
so
the
mistake
is
not
perhaps
unpardonable
although
the
latter
mountain
is
one
that
is
considerably
higher
than
the
wetterhorn
or
monte
viso
it
has
no
name
we
called
it
the
pic
sans
nom
it
has
been
observed
by
others
that
it
is
improbable
the
french
surveyors
should
have
remained
for
several
days
upon
the
pic
de
la
pyramide
without
visiting
the
other
and
loftier
summit
if
they
did
it
is
strange
that
they
did
not
leave
some
memorial
of
their
visit
the
natives
who
accompanied
them
asserted
that
they
did
not
pass
from
one
to
the
other
we
therefore
claimed
to
have
made
the
ascent
of
the
loftiest
point
for
the
first
time
the
claim
however
can
not
be
sustained
on
account
of
the
ascent
of
puiseux
it
is
a
matter
of
little
moment
the
excursion
had
for
us
all
the
interest
of
a
first
ascent
and
i
look
back
upon
this
my
first
serious
mountain
scramble
with
more
satisfaction
and
with
as
much
pleasure
as
upon
any
that
is
recorded
in
this
volume
a
few
days
later
i
left
abries
to
seek
a
quiet
bundle
of
hay
at
le
village
some
miles
nearer
to
the
viso
on
approaching
the
place
the
odour
of
sanctity
became
distinctly
perceptible
and
on
turning
a
corner
the
cause
was
was
the
priest
of
the
place
surrounded
by
some
of
his
flock
i
advanced
humbly
hat
in
hand
but
almost
before
a
word
could
be
said
he
broke
out
with
who
are
you
what
are
you
what
do
you
want
i
endeavoured
to
explain
you
are
a
deserter
i
know
you
are
a
deserter
go
away
you
can
t
stay
here
go
to
le
monta
down
there
i
won
t
have
you
here
and
he
literally
drove
me
away
the
explanation
of
his
strange
behaviour
was
that
piedmontese
soldiers
who
were
tired
of
the
service
had
not
unfrequently
crossed
the
col
de
la
traversette
into
the
valley
and
trouble
had
arisen
from
harbouring
them
however
i
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
and
was
not
a
little
indignant
that
i
who
was
marching
to
the
attack
should
be
taken
for
a
deserter
so
i
walked
away
and
shortly
afterwards
as
it
was
getting
dark
encamped
in
a
lovely
cavity
or
kind
of
basin
in
the
earth
with
a
stream
on
one
side
a
rock
to
windward
and
some
broken
fir
branches
close
at
hand
nothing
could
be
more
perfect
rock
hole
wood
and
water
after
making
a
roaring
fire
i
nestled
in
my
blanket
bag
an
ordinary
blanket
sewn
up
double
round
the
legs
with
a
piece
of
elastic
riband
round
the
open
end
and
slept
but
not
for
long
i
was
troubled
with
dreams
of
the
inquisition
the
tortures
were
being
were
forcing
fleas
down
my
nostrils
and
into
my
with
pincers
were
taking
out
bits
of
flesh
and
then
cutting
off
my
ears
and
tickling
the
soles
of
my
feet
this
was
too
much
i
yelled
a
great
yell
and
awoke
to
find
myself
covered
with
innumerable
crawling
bodies
they
were
ants
i
had
camped
by
an
and
after
making
its
inhabitants
mad
with
the
fire
had
coolly
lain
down
in
their
midst
illustration
the
blanket
bag
the
night
was
fine
and
as
i
settled
down
in
more
comfortable
quarters
a
brilliant
meteor
sailed
across
full
of
the
cloudless
sky
leaving
a
trail
of
light
behind
which
lasted
for
several
seconds
it
was
the
herald
of
a
splendid
spectacle
stars
fell
by
hundreds
and
not
dimmed
by
intervening
vapours
they
sparkled
with
greater
brightness
than
sirius
in
our
damp
climate
the
next
morning
after
walking
up
the
valley
to
examine
the
viso
i
returned
to
abries
and
engaged
a
man
from
a
neighbouring
hamlet
an
inveterate
smoker
and
thirsty
in
proportion
whose
pipe
never
left
his
mouth
except
to
allow
him
to
drink
we
returned
up
the
valley
together
and
slept
in
a
hut
of
a
shepherd
whose
yearly
wage
was
almost
as
small
as
that
of
the
herdsman
spoken
of
in
hyperion
by
longfellow
and
the
next
morning
in
his
company
proceeded
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
which
i
had
crossed
in
we
were
baffled
in
our
attempt
to
get
closer
to
the
mountain
a
deep
notch
with
precipitous
cliffs
cut
us
off
from
it
the
too
which
existed
in
the
preceding
year
on
the
piedmontese
side
of
the
pass
was
now
wanting
and
we
were
unable
to
descend
the
rocks
which
lay
beneath
a
fortnight
afterwards
the
mountain
was
ascended
for
the
first
time
by
mathews
and
jacomb
with
the
two
croz
s
of
chamounix
their
attempt
was
made
from
the
side
and
the
ascent
which
was
formerly
considered
a
thing
totally
impossible
has
become
one
of
the
most
common
and
favourite
excursions
of
the
district
the
night
of
the
of
august
found
me
at
veran
a
village
made
famous
by
neff
but
in
no
other
respect
remarkable
saving
that
it
is
one
of
the
highest
in
europe
the
poor
inn
gave
the
impression
of
great
poverty
there
was
no
meat
no
bread
no
butter
or
cheese
almost
the
only
things
that
could
be
obtained
were
eggs
the
manners
of
the
natives
were
primitive
the
woman
of
the
inn
without
the
least
sense
of
impropriety
stayed
in
the
room
until
i
was
fairly
in
bed
and
her
bill
for
supper
bed
and
breakfast
amounted
to
one
and
sevenpence

natural

near

in
this
neighbourhood
and
indeed
all
round
about
the
viso
the
chamois
still
remain
in
considerable
numbers
they
said
at
veran
that
six
had
been
seen
from
the
village
on
the
day
i
was
there
and
the
innkeeper
declared
that
he
had
seen
fifty
together
in
the
previous
week
i
myself
saw
in
this
and
in
the
previous
season
several
small
companies
round
about
the
viso
it
is
perhaps
as
favourable
a
district
as
any
in
the
alps
for
a
sportsman
who
wishes
to
hunt
the
chamois
as
the
ground
over
which
they
wander
is
by
no
means
of
excessive
difficulty
the
next
day
i
descended
the
valley
to
ville
vieille
and
passed
near
the
village
of
molines
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
a
remarkable
natural
pillar
in
form
not
unlike
a
champagne
bottle
about
sixty
feet
high
which
had
been
produced
by
the
action
of
the
weather
and
in
all
probability
chiefly
by
rain
these
natural
pillars
are
among
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
the
potent
effects
produced
by
the
action
of
forces
they
are
found
in
several
other
places
in
the
alps
as
well
as
elsewhere
the
village
of
ville
vieille
boasts
of
an
inn
with
the
sign
of
the
elephant
which
in
the
opinion
of
local
amateurs
is
a
proof
that
hannibal
passed
through
the
gorge
of
the
guil
i
remember
the
place
because
its
bread
being
only
a
month
old
was
unusually
soft
and
for
the
first
time
during
ten
days
it
was
possible
to
eat
some
without
first
of
all
chopping
it
into
small
pieces
and
soaking
it
in
hot
water
which
produced
a
slimy
paste
on
the
outside
but
left
a
hard
untouched
kernel
the
same
day
i
crossed
the
col

to
brian√ßon
it
was
the
of
august
and
all

was

from

passed

natives
in
all
degrees
of
inebriation
staggered
about

was
late
before
the
lights
of
the
great
fortress
came
into
sight

through

chapter
iii
my
first
scramble
on
the
matterhorn
what
power
must
have
been
required
to
shatter
and
to
sweep
away
the
missing
parts
of
this
pyramid
for
we
do
not
see
it
surrounded
by
heaps
of
fragments
one
only
sees
other
rooted
to
the
sides
equally
rent
indicate
an
immense
mass
of
d√©bris
of
which
we
do
not
see
any
trace
in
the
neighbourhood
doubtless
this
is
that
d√©bris
which
in
the
form
of
pebbles
boulders
and
sand
covers
our
valleys
and
our
de
saussure
two
summits
amongst
those
in
the
alps
which
yet
remained
virgin
had
especially
excited
my
admiration
one
of
these
had
been
attacked
numberless
times
by
the
best
mountaineers
without
success
the
other
surrounded
by
traditional
inaccessibility
was
almost
untouched
these
mountains
were
the
weisshorn
and
the
matterhorn
after
visiting
the
great
tunnel
of
the
alps
in
i
wandered
for
ten
days
in
the
neighbouring
valleys
intending
presently
to
attempt
the
ascent
of
these
two
peaks
rumours
were
floating
about
that
the
former
had
been
conquered
and
that
the
latter
was
shortly
to
be
attacked
and
they
were
confirmed
on
arrival
at
chatillon
at
the
entrance
of
the
val
tournanche
my
interest
in
the
weisshorn
consequently
abated
but
it
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
on
hearing
that
professor
tyndall
was
at
breil
and
intending
to
try
to
crown
his
first
victory
by
another
and
still
greater
one
up
to
this
time
my
experience
with
guides
had
not
been
fortunate
and
i
was
inclined
improperly
to
rate
them
at
a
low
value
they
represented
to
me
pointers
out
of
paths
and
large
consumers
of
meat
and
drink
but
little
more
and
with
the
recollection
of
mont
pelvoux
i
should
have
greatly
preferred
the
company
of
a
couple
of
my
countrymen
to
any
number
of
guides
in
answer
to
inquiries
at
chatillon
a
series
of
men
came
forward
whose
faces
expressed
malice
pride
envy
hatred
and
roguery
of
every
description
but
who
seemed
to
be
destitute
of
all
good
qualities
the
arrival
of
two
gentlemen
with
a
guide
who
they
represented
was
the
embodiment
of
every
virtue
and
exactly
the
man
for
the
matterhorn
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
engage
any
of
the
others
my
new
guide
in
was
a
combination
of
chang
and
anak
and
although
in
acquiring
him
i
did
not
obtain
exactly
what
was
wanted
his
late
employers
did
exactly
what
wanted
for
i
obtained
the
responsibility
without
knowledge
of
paying
his
back
fare
which
must
have
been
a
relief
at
once
to
their
minds
and
to
their
purses
when
walking
up
towards
breil
we
inquired
for
another
man
of
all
the
knowing
ones
and
they
with
one
voice
proclaimed
that
carrel
of
the
village
of
val
tournanche
was
the
cock
of
his
valley
we
sought
of
course
for
carrel
and
found
him
a
fellow
with
a
certain
defiant
air
which
was
rather
taking
yes
he
would
go
twenty
francs
a
day
whatever
was
the
result
was
his
price
i
assented
but
i
must
take
his
comrade
why
so
oh
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
get
along
without
another
man
as
he
said
this
an
evil
countenance
came
forth
out
of
the
darkness

of

we
were
about

unnecessary
to
enter
into
a
minute
description
of
the
matterhorn
after
all
that
has
been
written
about
that
famous
mountain
those
by
whom
this
book
is
likely
to
be
read
will
know
that
that
peak
is
nearly
feet
high
and
that
it
rises
abruptly
by
a
series
of
cliffs
which
may
properly
be
termed
precipices
a
clear
feet
above
the
glaciers
which
surround
its
base
they
will
know
too
that
it
was
the
last
great
alpine
peak
which
remained
unscaled
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
than
from
the
terror
inspired
by
its
invincible
appearance
there
seemed
to
be
a
drawn
around
it

which
one
might
go

no
farther

invisible

and
the
spirits
of
the
damned
the
superstitious
natives
in
the
surrounding
valleys
many
of
whom
still
firmly
believe
it
to
be
not
only
the
highest
mountain
in
the
alps
but
in
the
world
spoke
of
a
ruined
city
on
its
summit
wherein
the
spirits
dwelt
and
if
you
laughed
they
gravely
shook
their
heads
told
you
to
look
yourself
to
see
the
castles
and
the
walls
and
warned
one
against
a
rash
approach
lest
the
infuriate
demons
from
their
impregnable
heights
might
hurl
down
vengeance

ordinarily
spoke

are

this
chapter
the
matterhorn
looks
equally
imposing
from
whatever
side
it
is
seen
it
never
seems
commonplace
and
in
this
respect
and
in
regard
to
the
impression
it
makes
upon
spectators
it
stands
almost
alone
amongst
mountains
it
has
no
rivals
in
the
alps
and
but
few
in
the
world
the
seven
or
eight
thousand
feet
which
compose
the
actual
peak
have
several
ridges
and
numerous
others
the
most
continuous
is
that
which
leads
towards

summit

at
its
higher
and
the
little
peak
called

lower
end

is

the
summit

ridge

slope
of

ridges
will
be
referred
to
as
the
eastern
face
a
third
somewhat
less
continuous
than
the
others
descends
in
a
direction
and
the
portion
of
the
mountain
that
is
seen
from
breil
is
confined
to
that
which
is
comprised
between
this
and
the
second
ridge
this
section
is
not
composed
like
that
between
the
first
and
second
ridge
of
one
grand
face
but
it
is
broken
up
into
a

there

are

that
the
causes
are
still
in
operation
which
have
been
at
work

most
tourists
obtain
their
first
view
of
the
mountain
either
from
the
valley
of
zermatt
or
from
that
of
tournanche
from
the
former
direction
the
base
of
the
mountain
is
seen
at
its
narrowest
and
its
ridges
and
faces
seem
to
be
of
prodigious
steepness
the
tourist
toils
up
the
valley
looking
frequently
for
the
great
sight
which
is
to
reward
his
pains
without
seeing
it
for
the
mountain
is
first
perceived
in
that
direction
about
a
mile
to
the
north
of
zermatt
when
all
at
once
as
he
turns
a
rocky
corner
of
the
path
it
comes
into
view
not
however
where
it
is
expected
the
face
has
to
be
raised
up
to
look
at
it
it
seems
overhead
although
this
is
the
impression
the
fact
is
that
the
summit
of
the
matterhorn
from
this
point
makes
an
angle
with
the
eye
of
less
than
while
the
dom
from
the
same
place
makes
a
larger
angle
but
is
passed
by
unobserved
so
little
can
dependence
be
placed
on
unaided
vision
the
view
of
the
mountain
from
breil
in
the
val
tournanche
is
not
less
striking
than
that
on
the
other
side
but
usually
it
makes
less
impression
because
the
spectator
grows
accustomed
to
the
sight
while
coming
up
or
down
the
valley
from
this
direction
the
mountain
is
seen
to
be
broken
up
into
a
series
of
pyramidal
masses
on
the
other
side
it
is
remarkable
for
the
large
unbroken
extent
of
cliffs
that
it
presents
and
for
the
simplicity
of
its
outline
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
a
way
would
more
readily
be
found
to
the
summit
on
a
side
thus
broken
up
than
in
any
other
direction
the

to

glacier
forbade
any
attempt
in
direction
there
remained
only
the
side
of
val
tournanche
and
it
will
be
found
that
nearly
all
the
earliest
attempts
to
ascend
the
mountain
were
made
upon
the
southern
side
the
first
efforts
to
ascend
the
matterhorn
of
which
i
have
heard
were
made
by
the
guides
or
rather
by
the
chasseurs
of
val
tournanche
these
attempts
were
made
in
the
years
from
the
direction
of
breil
and
the
highest
point
that
was
attained
was
perhaps
as
far
as
the
place
which
is
now
called
the
chimney

a
height
of
about
feet
those
who
were
concerned
in
these
expeditions
were

the

gabrielle
maquignaz
i
have
been
unable
to
obtain
any
further
details
respecting
them
the
next
attempt
was
a
remarkable
one
and
of
it
too
there
is
no
published
account
it
was
made
by
the

and
sandbach

these
gentlemen
endeavoured
to
storm
the
citadel

attacking
its
eastern
face

which
reference

just
now
made

sandbach

informs
me
that
he
and
his
brothers
went
along
the
ridge
between
the

and
the
peak

they
came
to

point

the
ascending

is
considerably
increased

they
were
then
obliged
to
bear
a
little
to
the
left
to
get
on
to
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
afterwards
they
turned
to
the
right
and
ascended
about
feet
farther
keeping
as
nearly
as
was
practicable
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge

occasionally
bearing
a
little

more

the
brothers
started
from
zermatt
and
did
not
sleep
out
clouds
a
high
wind
and
want
of
time
were
the
causes
which
prevented
these
daring
gentlemen
from
going
farther

their
highest
point
was

the
third
attempt
upon
the
mountain
was
made
towards
the
end
of
august
by
vaughan
hawkins
from
the
side
of
the
val
tournanche
a
vivid
account
of
his
expedition
has
been
published
by
him
in
and
it
has
been
referred
to
several
times
by
professor
tyndall
in
the
numerous
papers
he
has
contributed
to
alpine
literature
i
will
dismiss
it
therefore
as
briefly
as
possible
hawkins
had
inspected
the
mountain
in
with
the
guide
bennen
and
he
had
formed
the
opinion
that
the
ridge
would
lead
to
the
summit
he
engaged
jacques
carrel
who
was
concerned
in
the
first
attempts
and
accompanied
by
bennen
and
by
professor
tyndall
whom
he
had
invited
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
he
started
for
the
gap
between
the
little
and
the
great
peak
illustration
bennen
bennen
was
a
guide
who
was
beginning
to
be
talked
about
during
the
chief
part
of
his
brief
career
he
was
in
the
service
of
wellig
the
landlord
of
the
inn
on
the
√¶ggischhorn
and
was
hired
out
by
him
to
tourists
although
his
experience
was
limited
he
had
acquired
a
good
reputation
and
his
book
of
certificates
which
is
lying
before
me
shows
that
he
was
highly
esteemed
by
his
employers
a
man
with
courteous
gentlemanly
manners
skilful
and
bold
he
might
by
this
time
have
taken
a
front
place
amongst
guides
if
he
had
only
been
endowed
with
more
prudence
he
perished
miserably
in
the
spring
of
not
far
from
his
home
on
a
mountain
called
the
haut
de
cry
in
the
valais
hawkins
party
led
by
bennen
climbed
the
rocks
abutting
against
the
couloir
du
lion
on
its
south
side
and
attained
the
col
du
lion
although
not
without
difficulty
they
then
followed
the
ridge
passed
the
place
at
which
the
earliest
explorers
had
turned
back
the
chimney
and
ascended
about
feet
more
hawkins
and
carrel
then
stopped
but
bennen
and
professor
tyndall
mounted
a
few
feet
higher
they
retreated
however
in
less
than
finding
that
there
was
too
little
time
and
descending
to
the
col
by
the
same
route
as
they
had
followed
on
the
ascent
proceeded
thence
to
breil
down
the
couloir
instead
of
by
the
rocks
the
point
at
which
hawkins
stopped
is
easily
identified
from
his
description
its
height
is
feet
above
the
sea
i
think
that
bennen
and
tyndall
could
not
have
ascended
more
than
or
feet
beyond
this
in
the
few
minutes
they
were
absent
from
the
others
as
they
were
upon
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
mountain
this
party
therefore
accomplished
an
advance
of
about
or
feet
hawkins
did
not
as
far
as
i
know
make
another
attempt
and
the
next
was
made
by
the
parker
in
july
they
again
started
from
zermatt
followed
the
route
they
had
struck
out
on
the
previous
year
and
got
a
little
higher
than
before
but
they
were
defeated
by
want
of
time
shortly
afterwards
left
zermatt
on
account
of
bad
weather
and
did
not
again
renew
their
attempts
parker
in
neither
case
did
we
go
as
high
as
we
could
at
the
point
where
we
turned
we
saw
our
way
for
a
few
hundred
feet
farther
but
beyond
that
the
difficulties
seemed
to
i
am
informed
that
both
attempts
should
be
considered
as
excursions
undertaken
with
the
view
of
ascertaining
whether
there
was
any
encouragement
to
make
a
more
deliberate
attack
on
the
side
my
guide
and
i
arrived
at
breil
on
the
of
august
and
we
found
that
professor
tyndall
been
there
a
day
or
two
before
but
had
done
nothing
i
had
seen
the
mountain
from
nearly
every
direction
and
it
seemed
even
to
a
novice
like
myself
far
too
much
for
a
single
day
i
intended
to
sleep
out
upon
it
as
high
as
possible
and
to
attempt
to
reach
the
summit
on
the
following
day
we
endeavoured
to
induce
another
man
to
accompany
us
but
without
success
matthias
zum
taugwald
and
other
guides
were
there
at
the
time
but
they
declined
to
go
on
any
account
a
sturdy
old
taugwalder
by
he
would
go
his
price
two
hundred
what
whether
we
ascend
or
not
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
all
the
men
who
were
more
or
less
capable
showed
a
strong
disinclination
or
positively
refused
to
go
their
disinclination
being
very
much
in
proportion
to
their
capacity
or
else
asked
a
prohibitive
price
this
it
may
be
said
once
for
all
was
the
reason
why
so
many
futile
attempts
were
made
upon
the
matterhorn
one
guide
after
another
was
brought
up
to
the
mountain
and
patted
on
the
back
but
all
declined
the
business
the
men
who
went
had
no
heart
in
the
matter
and
took
the
first
opportunity
to
turn
back
for
they
were
with
the
exception
of
one
man
to
whom
reference
will
be
made
presently
universally
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
summit
was
entirely
inaccessible
we
resolved
to
go
alone
and
anticipating
a
cold
bivouac
begged
the
loan
of
a
couple
of
blankets
from
the
innkeeper
he
refused
them
giving
the
curious
reason
that
we
had
bought
a
bottle
of
brandy
at
val
tournanche
and
had
not
bought
any
from
him
no
brandy
no
blankets
appeared
to
be
his
rule
we
did
not
require
them
that
night
as
it
was
passed
in
the
highest
in
the
valley
which
is
about
an
hour
nearer
to
the
mountain
than
is
the
hotel
the
cowherds
worthy
fellows
seldom
troubled
by
tourists
hailed
our
company
with
delight
and
did
their
best
to
make
us
comfortable
brought
out
their
little
stores
of
simple
food
and
as
we
sat
with
them
round
the
great
copper
pot
which
hung
over
the
fire
bade
us
in
husky
voice
but
with
honest
intent
to
beware
of
the
perils
of
the
haunted
cliffs
when
night
was
coming
on
we
saw
stealing
up
the
the
forms
of
carrel
and
the
comrade
oh
ho
i
said
you
have
repented
not
at
all
you
deceive
why
then
have
you
come
here
because
we
ourselves
are
going
on
the
mountain
oh
then
it
is
necessary
to
have
more
than
not
for
i
admired
their
pluck
and
had
a
strong
inclination
to
engage
the
pair
but
finally
decided
against
it
the
comrade
turned
out
to
be
the
carrel
who
had
been
with
hawkins
and
was
nearly
related
to
the
other
man
illustration
carrel
both
were
bold
mountaineers
but
was
incomparably
the
better
man
of
the
two
and
he
is
the
finest
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
the
only
man
who
persistently
refused
to
accept
defeat
and
who
continued
to
believe
in
spite
of
all
discouragements
that
the
great
mountain
was
not
inaccessible
and
that
it
could
be
ascended
from
the
side
of
his
native
valley
the
night
wore
away
without
any
excitement
except
from
the
fleas
a
party
of
whom
executed
a
spirited
fandango
on
my
cheek
to
the
sound
of
music
produced
on
the
drum
of
my
ear
by
one
of
their
fellows
beating
with
a
wisp
of
hay
the
two
carrels
crept
noiselessly
out
before
daybreak
and
went
off
we
did
not
start
until
nearly
seven
o
clock
and
followed
them
leisurely

all
our
properties

on
its
right
bank
our
left
hand
and
we
mounted
over
them
on
to
the
lower
portion
of
the
glacier
with
ease
but
as
we
ascended
crevasses
became
numerous
and
we
were
at
last
brought
to
a
halt
by
some
which
were
of
very
large
dimensions
and
as
our
cutting
powers
were
limited
we
sought
an
easier
route
and
turned
naturally
to
the
lower
rocks
of
the
t√™te

lion
which
overlook
the
glacier
on
its
west
some
good
scrambling
took
us
in
a
short
time
on
to

crest
of
the
ridge
which
descends
towards
the
south
and
thence
up
to
the
level

was

the
t√™te
du
lion
which
rise
above
the
couloir
had
to
be
skirted
this
part
varies
considerably
in
different
seasons
and
in
we
found
it
difficult
for
the
fine
steady
weather
of
that
year
had
reduced
the
abutting
against
it
to
a
lower
level
than
usual
and
the
rocks
which
were
left
exposed
at
the
junction
of
the
snow
with
the
cliffs
had
few
ledges
or
cracks
to
which
we
could
hold
but
by
ten
o
clock
we
stood
on
the
col
and
looked
down
upon
the
magnificent
basin
out
of
which
the
z
mutt
glacier
flows
we
decided
to
pass
the
night
upon
the
col
for
we
were
charmed
with
the
capabilities
of
the
place
although
it
was
one
where
liberties
could
not
be
taken
on
one
side
a
sheer
wall
overhung
the
tiefenmatten
glacier
on
the
other
steep
glassy
slopes
of
hard
snow
descended
to
the
glacier
du
lion
furrowed
by
water
and
by
falling
stones
on
the
north
there
was
the
great
peak
of
the
matterhorn
and
on
the
south
the
cliffs
of
the
t√™te
du
lion
throw
a
bottle
down
to
the
sound
returns
for
more
than
a
dozen
seconds
how
fearful
and
dizzy
tis
to
cast
one
s
eyes
so
low
illustration
the
col
du
lion
looking
towards
the
t√™te
du
lion
but
no
harm
could
come
from
that
side
neither
could
it
from
the
other
nor
was
it
likely
that
it
would
from
the
t√™te
du
lion
for
some
jutting
ledges
conveniently
overhung
our
proposed
we
waited
for
a
while
basked
in
the
sunshine
and
watched
or
listened
to
the
carrels
who
were
sometimes
seen
or
heard
high
above
us
upon
the
ridge
leading
towards
the
summit
and
leaving
at
we
descended
to
the
packed
up
the
tent
and
other
properties
and
returned
to
the
col
although
heavily
laden
before
six
o
clock
this
tent
was
constructed
on
a
pattern
suggested
by
francis
galton
and
it
was
not
a
success
it
looked
very
pretty
when
set
up
in
london
but
it
proved
thoroughly
useless
in
the
alps
it
was
made
of
light
canvas
and
opened
like
a
book
had
one
end
closed
permanently
and
the
other
with
flaps
it
was
supported
by
two
alpenstocks
and
had
the
canvas
sides
prolonged
so
as
to
turn
in
underneath
numerous
cords
were
sewn
to
the
lower
edges
to
which
stones
were
to
be
attached
but
the
main
fastenings
were
by
a
cord
which
passed
underneath
the
ridge
and
through
iron
rings
screwed
into
the
tops
of
the
alpenstocks
and
were
secured
by
pegs
the
wind
which
playfully
careered
about
the
surrounding
cliffs
was
driven
through
our
gap
with
the
force
of
a
the
flaps
of
the
tent
would
not
keep
down
the
pegs
would
not
stay
in
and
it
exhibited
so
marked
a
desire
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
dent
blanche
that
we
thought
it
prudent
to
take
it
down
and
to
sit
upon
it
when
night
came
on
we
wrapped
ourselves
in
it
and
made
our
camp
as
comfortable
as
the
circumstances
would
allow
the
silence
was
impressive
no
living
thing
was
near
our
solitary
bivouac
the
carrels
had
turned
back
and
were
out
of
hearing
the
stones
had
ceased
to
fall
and
the
trickling
water
to
the
music
of
whose
liquid
lip
had
been
to
us
companionship
and
in
our
lonely
life
had
grown
to
have
an
almost
human
it
was
bitterly
cold
water
froze
hard
in
a
bottle
under
my
head
not
surprising
as
we
were
actually
on
snow
and
in
a
position
where
the
slightest
wind
was
at
once
felt
for
a
time
we
dozed
but
about
midnight
there
came
from
high
aloft
a
tremendous
explosion
followed
by
a
second
of
dead
quiet
a
great
mass
of
rock
had
split
off
and
was
descending
towards
us
my
guide
started
up
wrung
his
hands
and
exclaimed
o
my
god
we
are
lost
we
heard
it
coming
mass
after
mass
pouring
over
the
precipices
bounding
and
rebounding
from
cliff
to
cliff
and
the
great
rocks
in
advance
smiting
one
another
they
seemed
to
be
close
although
they
were
probably
distant
but
some
small
fragments
which
dropped
upon
us
at
the
same
time
from
the
ledges
just
above
added
to
the
alarm
and
my
demoralised
companion
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
a
state
of
shudder
ejaculating
terrible
and
other
adjectives
we
put
ourselves
in
motion
at
daybreak
and
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
ridge
there
was
no
more
sauntering
with
hands
in
the
pockets
each
step
had
to
be
earned
by
downright
climbing
but
it
was
the
most
pleasant
kind
of
climbing
the
rocks
were
fast
and
unencumbered
with
d√©bris
the
cracks
were
good
although
not
numerous
and
there
was
nothing
to
fear
except
from
one
so
we
thought
at
least
and
shouted
to
awake
echoes
from
the
cliffs
ah
there
is
no
response
not
yet
wait
a
while
everything
here
is
upon
a
superlative
scale
count
a
dozen
and
then
the
echoes
will
return
from
the
walls
of
the
dent
d
h√©rens
miles
away
in
waves
of
pure
and
undefiled
sound
soft
musical
and
sweet
halt
a
moment
to
regard
the
view
we
overlook
the
t√™te
du
lion
and
nothing
except
the
dent
d
h√©rens
whose
summit
is
still
a
thousand
feet
above
us
stands
in
the
way
the
ranges
of
the
graian
ocean
of
seen
at
a
glance
governed
by
their
three
great
peaks
the
grivola
grand
paradis
and
tour
de
pierre
how
soft
and
yet
how
sharp
they
look
in
the
early
morning
the
mists
have
not
begun
to
rise
nothing
is
obscured
even
the
pointed
viso
all
but
a
hundred
miles
away
is
perfectly
defined
turn
to
the
east
and
watch
the
sun
s
slanting
rays
coming
across
the
monte
rosa
look
at
the
shadowed
parts
and
see
how
even
with
reflected
more
brilliant
than
man
knows
how
to
depict
see
gentle
undulations
give
shadows
within
shadows
and
falling
stones
or
ice
have
left
a
track
there
are
shadows
upon
shadows
each
with
a
light
and
a
dark
side
with
infinite
gradations
of
matchless
tenderness
then
note
the
sunlight
as
it
steals
noiselessly
along
and
reveals
countless
unsuspected
forms
delicate
which
mark
the
concealed
crevasse
and
the
waves
of
drifted
snow
producing
each
minute
more
lights
and
fresh
shadows
sparkling
on
the
edges
and
glittering
on
the
ends
of
the
icicles
shining
on
the
heights
and
illuminating
the
depths
until
all
is
aglow
and
the
dazzled
eye
returns
for
relief
to
the
sombre
crags
hardly
an
hour
had
passed
since
we
left
the
col
before
we
arrived
at
the
it
proved
to
be
the
counterpart
of
the
place
to
which
reference
has
been
made
at
a
smooth
straight
slab
of
rock
was
fixed
at
a
considerable
angle
between
two
others
equally
smooth
my
companion
essayed
to
go
up
and
after
crumpling
his
long
body
into
many
ridiculous
positions
he
said
that
he
would
not
for
he
could
not
do
it
with
some
little
trouble
i
got
up
it
unassisted
and
then
my
guide
tied
himself
on
to
the
end
of
our
rope
and
i
endeavoured
to
pull
him
up
but
he
was
so
awkward
that
he
did
little
for
himself
and
so
heavy
that
he
proved
too
much
for
me
and
after
several
attempts
he
untied
himself
and
quietly
observed
that
he
should
go
down
i
told
him
he
was
a
coward
and
mentioned
his
opinion
of
me
i
requested
him
to
go
to
breil
and
to
say
that
he
had
left
his
monsieur
on
the
mountain
and
he
turned
to
go
whereupon
i
had
to
eat
humble
pie
and
ask
him
to
come
back
for
although
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
go
up
and
not
at
all
dangerous
with
a
man
standing
below
it
was
quite
another
thing
to
come
down
as
the
lower
edge
overhung
in
a
provoking
manner
the
day
was
perfect
the
sun
was
pouring
down
grateful
warmth
the
wind
had
fallen
the
way
seemed
clear
no
insuperable
obstacle
was
in
sight
yet
what
could
one
do
alone
i
stood
on
the
top
chafing
under
this
unexpected
contretemps
and
remained
for
some
time
irresolute
but
as
it
became
apparent
that
the
chimney
was
swept
more
frequently
than
was
necessary
it
was
a
natural
channel
for
falling
stones
i
turned
at
last
descended
with
the
assistance
of
my
companion
and
returned
with
him
to
breil
where
we
arrived
about
the
carrels
did
not
show
themselves
but
we
were
told
that
they
had
not
got
to
any
great
height
and
that
the
comrade
who
for
convenience
had
taken
off
his
shoes
and
tied
them
round
his
waist
had
managed
to
let
one
of
them
slip
and
had
come
down
with
a
piece
of
cord
fastened
round
his
naked
foot
notwithstanding
this
they
had
boldly
glissaded
down
the
couloir
du
lion
carrel
having
his
shoeless
foot
tied
up
in
a
pocket
handkerchief
the
matterhorn
was
not
assailed
again
in
i
left
breil
with
the
conviction
that
it
was
little
use
for
a
single
tourist
to
organise
an
attack
upon
it
so
great
was
its
influence
on
the
morals
of
the
guides
and
persuaded
that
it
was
desirable
at
least
two
should
go
to
back
each
other
when
required
and
departed
with
my
guide
over
the
col
th√©odule
longing
more
than
before
to
make
the
ascent
and
determined
to
return
if
possible
with
a
companion
to
lay
siege
to
the
mountain
until
one
or
the
other
was
vanquished

the
year
was
still
young
and
the
matterhorn
clad
in
its
wintry
garb
bore
but
little
resemblance
to
the
matterhorn
of
the
summer
when
a
new
force
came
to
do
battle
with
the
mountain
from
another
direction
kennedy
of
leeds
conceived
the
extraordinary
idea
that
the
peak
might
prove
less
impracticable
in
january
than
in
june
and
arrived
at
zermatt
in
the
former
month
to
put
his
conception
to
the
test
with
stout
peter
perrn
and
sturdy
peter
taugwalder
he
slept
in
the
little
chapel
at
the
schwarzensee
and
on
the
next
morning
like
the
parker
followed
the
ridge
between
the
peak
called
h√∂rnli
and
the
great
mountain
but
they
found
that
snow
in
winter
obeyed
the
ordinary
laws
and
that
the
wind
and
frost
were
not
less
unkind
than
in
summer
the
wind
whirled
up
the
snow
and
spicul√¶
of
ice
into
our
faces
like
needles
and
flat
pieces
of
ice
a
foot
in
diameter
carried
up
from
the
glacier
below
went
flying
past
still
no
one
seemed
to
like
to
be
the
first
to
give
in
till
a
gust
fiercer
than
usual
forced
us
to
shelter
for
a
time
behind
a
rock
immediately
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
our
expedition
must
now
end
but
we
determined
to
leave
some
memento
of
our
visit
and
after
descending
a
considerable
distance
we
found
a
suitable
place
with
loose
stones
of
which
to
build
a
cairn
in
a
tower
six
feet
high
was
erected
a
bottle
with
the
date
was
placed
inside
and
we
retreated
as
rapidly
as
this
cairn
was
placed
at
the
spot
marked
upon
dufour
s
map
of
switzerland
feet
m√®tres
and
the
highest
point
attained
by
kennedy
was
not
i
imagine
more
than
two
or
three
hundred
feet
above
it
shortly
after
this
professor
tyndall
gave
in
his
little
tract
in
an
account
of
the
reason
why
he
had
left
breil
in
august
without
doing
anything
it
seems
that
he
sent
his
guide
bennen
to
reconnoitre
and
that
the
latter
made
the
following
report
to
his
employer
herr
i
have
examined
the
mountain
carefully
and
find
it
more
difficult
and
dangerous
than
i
had
imagined
there
is
no
place
upon
it
where
we
could
well
pass
the
night
we
might
do
so
on
yonder
col
upon
the
snow
but
there
we
should
be
almost
frozen
to
death
and
totally
unfit
for
the
work
of
the
next
day
on
the
rocks
there
is
no
ledge
or
cranny
which
could
give
us
proper
harbourage
and
starting
from
breuil
it
is
certainly
impossible
to
reach
the
summit
in
a
single
i
was
entirely
taken
aback
says
tyndall
by
this
report
i
felt
like
a
man
whose
grip
had
given
way
and
who
was
dropping
through
the
air
bennen
was
evidently
dead
against
any
attempt
upon
the
mountain
we
can
at
all
events
reach
the
lower
of
the
two
summits
i
remarked
even
that
is
difficult
he
replied
but
when
you
have
reached
it
what
then
the
peak
has
neither
name
nor
i
was
more
surprised
than
discouraged
by
this
report
by
bennen
one
half
of
his
assertions
i
knew
to
be
wrong
the
col
to
which
he
referred
was
the
col
du
lion
upon
which
we
had
passed
a
night
less
than
a
week
after
he
had
spoken
so
authoritatively
and
i
had
seen
a
place
not
far
below
the
chimney
place
about
feet
above
the
it
seemed
possible
to
construct
a
bennen
s
opinions
seem
to
have
undergone
a
complete
change
in
he
is
described
as
having
been
enthusiastic
to
make
an
attempt
and
in
he
was
dead
against
one
nothing
dismayed
by
this
my
friend
reginald
macdonald
our
companion
on
the
whom
so
much
of
our
success
had
been
due
agreed
to
join
me
in
a
renewed
assault
from
the
south
and
although
we
failed
to
secure
melchior
anderegg
and
some
other
notable
guides
we
obtained
two
men
of
repute
namely
johann
zum
taugwald
and
johann
kronig
of
zermatt
we
met
at
that
place
early
in
july
but
stormy
weather
prevented
us
even
from
passing
to
the
other
side
of
the
chain
for
some
time
we
crossed
the
col
th√©odule
on
the
in
thoroughly
unsettled
was
falling
in
the
valleys
and
snow
upon
the
mountains
shortly
before
we
gained
the
summit
we
were
made
extremely
uncomfortable
by
hearing
mysterious
rushing
sounds
which
sometimes
seemed
as
if
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
was
sweeping
along
the
snow
and
at
others
almost
like
the
swishing
of
a
long
whip
yet
the
snow
exhibited
no
signs
of
motion
and
the
air
was
perfectly
calm
the
dense
black
made
us
momentarily
expect
that
our
bodies
might
be
used
as
and
we
were
well
satisfied
to
get
under
shelter
of
the
inn
at
breil
without
having
submitted
to
any
such
experience
we
had
need
of
a
porter
and
by
the
advice
of
our
landlord
descended
to
the
chalets
of
breil
in
search
of
one
luc
meynet
we
found
his
house
a
mean
abode
encumbered
with
apparatus
and
tenanted
only
by
some
children
but
as
they
said
that
uncle
luc
would
soon
be
home
we
waited
at
the
door
of
the
little
chalet
and
watched
for
him
at
last
a
speck
was
seen
coming
round
the
corner
of
the
patch
of
firs
below
breil
and
then
the
children
clapped
their
hands
dropped
their
toys
and
ran
eagerly
forward
to
meet
him
we
saw
an
ungainly
wobbling
figure
stoop
down
and
catch
up
the
little
ones
kiss
them
on
each
cheek
and
put
them
into
the
empty
panniers
on
each
side
of
the
mule
and
then
heard
it
come
on
carolling
as
if
this
was
not
a
world
of
woe
and
yet
the
face
of
little
luc
meynet
the
hunchback
of
breil
bore
traces
of
trouble
and
sorrow
and
there
was
more
than
a
touch
of
sadness
in
his
voice
when
he
said
that
he
must
look
after
his
brother
s
children
all
his
difficulties
were
however
at
length
overcome
and
he
agreed
to
join
us
to
carry
the
tent
in
the
past
winter
i
had
turned
my
attention
to
tents
and
that
which
we
had
brought
with
us
was
the
result
of
experiments
to
devise
one
which
should
be
sufficiently
portable
to
be
taken
over
the
most
difficult
ground
and
which
should
combine
lightness
with
stability
its
base
was
just
under
six
feet
square
and
a
perpendicular
to
its
length
was
an
equilateral
triangle
the
sides
of
which
were
six
feet
long
it
was
intended
to
accommodate
four
persons
it
was
supported
by
four
six
feet
and
a
half
long
and
one
inch
and
a
quarter
thick
tapering
to
the
top
to
an
inch
and
an
eighth
these
were
shod
with
iron
points
the
order
of
proceeding
in
the
construction
of
the
tent
was
as
follows
were
drilled
through
the
poles
about
five
inches
from
their
tops
for
the
insertion
of
two
bolts
three
inches
long
and
one
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
the
bolts
were
then
inserted
and
the
two
pairs
of
poles
were
set
out
and
fixed
up
by
cords
to
the
proper
dimensions
the
roof
was
then
put
on
this
was
made
of
the
rough
unbleached
calico
called
forfar
which
can
be
obtained
in
widths
and
it
was
continued
round
for
about
two
feet
on
each
side
on
to
the
floor
the
width
of
the
material
was
the
length
of
the
tent
and
seams
were
thus
avoided
in
the
roof
the
forfar
was
sewn
round
each
pole
particular
care
being
taken
to
avoid
wrinkles
and
to
get
the
whole
perfectly
taut
the
flooring
was
next
put
in
and
sewn
down
to
the
forfar
this
was
of
the
ordinary
plaid
mackintosh
about
nine
feet
square
the
surplus
three
feet
being
continued
up
the
sides
to
prevent
draughts
it
is
as
well
to
have
two
feet
of
this
surplus
on
one
side
and
only
one
foot
on
the
other
the
latter
amount
being
sufficient
for
the
side
occupied
by
the
feet
one
end
was
then
permanently
closed
by
a
triangular
piece
of
forfar
which
was
sewn
down
to
that
which
was
already
fixed
the
other
end
was
left
open
and
had
two
triangular
flaps
that
overlapped
each
other
and
which
were
fastened
up
when
we
were
inside
by
pieces
of
tape
lastly
the
forfar
was
nailed
down
to
the
poles
to
prevent
the
tent
getting
out
of
shape
the
cord
which
was
used
for
climbing
served
for
the
tent
it
was
passed
over
the
crossed
poles
and
underneath
the
ridge
of
the
roof
and
the
two
fore
and
the
other
easily
secured
to
pieces
of
rock
such
a
tent
costs
about
four
guineas
and
its
weight
is
about
pounds
or
if
the
lightest
kind
of
forfar
is
used
it
need
not
exceed
twenty
pounds
when
it
was
fastened
up
for
transport
it
presented
the
appearance
shown
in
the
portrait
of
meynet
at
and
it
could
be
unrolled
and
set
up
by
two
persons

minutes

the
author
s
mountain
tent
this
tent
is
intended
and
adapted
for
camping
out
at
high
altitudes
or
in
cold
climates
it
is
not
pretended
that
it
is
perfectly
waterproof
but
it
can
be
made
so
by
the
addition
of
mackintosh
to
the
roof
and
this
increases
the
weight
by
only
two
and
a
half
pounds
it
is
then
fit
for
general
use
it
may
be
observed
that
the
pattern
of
this
tent
is
identical
in
all
essential
points
with
that
arrived
at
after
great
experience
by
sir
leopold
m
clintock
for
arctic
work
and
frequent
use
by
many
persons
under
varied
conditions
has
shown
that
the
pattern
is
both
practical
and
substantial
sunday
the
of
july
was
showery
and
snow
fell
on
the
matterhorn
but
we
started
on
the
following
morning
with
our
three
men
and
pursued
my
route
of
the
previous
year
i
was
requested
to
direct
the
way
as
none
save
myself
had
been
on
the
mountain
before
i
did
not
distinguish
myself
upon
this
occasion
and
led
my
companions
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
small
peak
before
the
mistake
was
discovered
the
party
becoming
rebellious
a
little
exploration
was
made
towards
our
right
and
we
found
that
we
were
upon
the
top
of
the
cliff
overlooking
the
col
du
lion
the
upper
part
of
the
small
peak
is
of
a
very
different
character
to
the
lower
part
the
rocks
are
not
so
firm
and
they
are
usually
covered
or
intermixed
with
snow
and
glazed
with
ice
the
angle
too
is
more
severe
while
descending
a
small
to
get
on
to
the
right
track
kronig
slipped
on
a
streak
of
ice
and
went
down
at
a
fearful
pace
fortunately
he
kept
on
his
legs
and
by
a
great
effort
succeeded
in
stopping
just
before
he
arrived
at
some
rocks
that
jutted
through
the
snow
which
would
infallibly
have
knocked
him
over
when
we
rejoined
him
a
few
minutes
later
we
found
that
he
was
incapable
of
standing
much
less
of
moving
with
a
face
in
hue
and
trembling
violently
he
remained
in
this
condition
for
more
than
an
hour
and
the
day
was
consequently
far
advanced
before
we
arrived
at
our
on
the
profiting
by
the
experience
of
last
year
we
did
not
pitch
the
tent
actually
on
the
snow
but
collected
a
quantity
of
d√©bris
from
the
neighbouring
ledges
and
after
constructing
a
rough
platform
of
the
larger
pieces
levelled
the
whole
with
the
dirt
and
mud
meynet
had
proved
invaluable
as
a
his
legs
were
more
picturesque
than
symmetrical
and
although
he
seemed
to
be
built
on
principle
with
no
two
parts
very
deformities
proved
of
service
and
we
quickly
found
he
had
spirit
of
no
common
order
and
that
few
peasants
are
more
agreeable
companions
or
better
climbers
than
little
luc
meynet
the
hunchback
of
breil
he
now
showed
himself
not
less
serviceable
as
a
scavenger
and
humbly
asked
for
gristly
pieces
of
meat
rejected
by
the
others
or
for
suspicious
eggs
and
seemed
to
consider
it
a
peculiar
favour
if
not
a
treat
to
be
permitted
to
drink
the
with
the
greatest
contentment
he
took
the
worst
place
at
the
door
of
the
tent
and
did
all
the
dirty
work
which
was
put
upon
him
by
the
guides
as
gratefully
as
a
has
been
well
receive
a
stroke
a
strong
wind
sprang
up
from
the
east
during
the
night
and
in
the
morning
it
was
blowing
almost
a
hurricane
the
tent
behaved
nobly
and
we
remained
under
its
shelter
for
several
hours
after
the
sun
had
risen
uncertain
what
it
was
best
to
do
a
lull
tempted
us
to
move
but
we
had
scarcely
ascended
a
hundred
feet
before
the
storm
burst
upon
us
with
increased
fury
advance
or
return
was
alike
impossible
the
ridge
was
denuded
of
its
d√©bris
and
we
clutched
our
hardest
when
we
saw
stones
as
big
as
a
man
s
fist
blown
away
horizontally
into
space
we
dared
not
attempt
to
stand
upright
and
remained
stationary
on
all
fours
glued
as
it
were
to
the
rocks
it
was
intensely
cold
for
the
blast
had
swept
along
the
main
chain
of
the
pennine
alps
and
across
the
great
around
monte
rosa
our
warmth
and
courage
rapidly
evaporated
and
at
the
next
lull
we
retreated
to
the
tent
having
to
halt
several
times
even
in
that
short
distance
taugwald
and
kronig
then
declared
that
they
had
had
enough
and
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
mountain
meynet
also
informed
us
that
he
would
be
required
down
below
for
important
operations
on
the
following
day
it
was
therefore
needful
to
return
to
breil
and
we
arrived
there
at
extremely
chagrined
at
our
complete
defeat
carrel
attracted
by
rumours
had
come
up
to
the
inn
during
our
absence
and
after
some
negotiations
agreed
to
accompany
us
with
one
of
his
friends
named
pession
on
the
first
fine
day
we
thought
ourselves
fortunate
for
carrel
clearly
considered
the
mountain
a
kind
of
and
regarded
our
late
attempt
as
an
act
of
the
wind
blew
itself
out
during
the
night
and
we
started
again
with
these
two
men
and
a
porter
at
on
the
with
unexceptionable
weather
carrel
pleased
us
by
suggesting
that
we
should
camp
even
higher
than
before
and
we
accordingly
proceeded
without
resting
at
the
col
until
we
overtopped
the
t√™te
du
lion
near
the
foot
of
the
chimney
a
little
below
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
on
its
eastern
side
we
found
a
protected
place
and
by
building
up
from
ledge
to
ledge
under
the
direction
of
our
leader
who
was
a
mason
by
profession
we
at
length
constructed
a
platform
of
sufficient
size
and
of
considerable
solidity
its
height
was
about
feet
above
the
sea
and
it
exists
i
believe
at
the
present
time
we
then
pushed
on
as
the
day
was
very
fine
and
after
a
short
hour
s
scramble
got
to
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
upon
the
ridge
that
is
to
say
to
hawkins
farthest
point
and
afterwards
returned
to
our
bivouac
we
turned
out
again
at
and
at
started
upwards
once
more
with
fine
weather
and
the
thermometer
at
carrel
scrambled
up
the
chimney
and
macdonald
and
i
after
him
pession
s
turn
came
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
top
he
looked
very
ill
declared
himself
to
be
thoroughly
incapable
and
said
that
he
must
go
back
we
waited
some
time
but
he
did
not
get
better
neither
could
we
learn
the
nature
of
his
illness
carrel
flatly
refused
to
go
on
with
us
alone
we
were
helpless
macdonald
ever
the
coolest
of
the
cool
suggested
that
we
should
try
what
we
could
do
without
them
but
our
better
judgment
prevailed
and
finally
we
returned
together
to
breil
on
the
next
day
my
friend
started
for
london
three
times
i
had
essayed
the
ascent
of
this
mountain
and
on
each
occasion
had
failed
ignominiously
i
had
not
advanced
a
yard
beyond
my
predecessors
up
to
the
height
of
nearly
feet
there
were
no
extraordinary
difficulties
the
way
so
far
might
even
become
a
matter
of
only
feet
remained
but
they
were
as
yet
untrodden
and
might
present
the
most
formidable
obstacles
no
man
could
expect
to
climb
them
by
himself
a
morsel
of
rock
only
seven
feet
high
might
at
any
time
defeat
him
if
it
were
perpendicular
such
a
place
might
be
possible
to
two
or
a
bagatelle
to
three
men
it
was
evident
that
a
party
should
consist
of
three
men
at
least
but
where
could
the
other
two
men
be
obtained
carrel
was
the
only
man
who
exhibited
any
enthusiasm
in
the
matter
and
he
in
had
absolutely
refused
to
go
unless
the
party
consisted
of
at
least
persons
want
of
men
made
the
difficulty
not
the
mountain
the
weather
became
bad
again
so
i
went
to
zermatt
on
the
chance
of
picking
up
a
man
and
remained
there
during
a
week
of
storms
not
one
of
the
better
men
however
could
be
induced
to
come
and
i
returned
to
breil
on
the
hoping
to
combine
the
skill
of
carrel
with
the
willingness
of
meynet
on
a
new
attempt
by
the
same
route
as
before
for
the
h√∂rnli
ridge
which
i
had
examined
in
the
meantime
seemed
to
be
entirely
impracticable
both
men
were
inclined
to
go
but
their
ordinary
occupations
prevented
them
from
starting
at
once
my
tent
had
been
left
rolled
up
at
the
second
platform
and
whilst
waiting
for
the
men
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
have
been
blown
away
during
the
late
stormy
weather
so
i
started
off
on
the
to
see
if
this
were
so
or
not
the
way
was
by
this
time
familiar
and
i
mounted
rapidly
astonishing
the
friendly
nodded
recognition
as
i
flitted
past
them
and
the
i
was
alone
because
no
man
was
available
but
more
deliberation
was
necessary
when
the
pastures
were
passed
and
climbing
began
for
it
was
needful
to
mark
each
step
in
case
of
mist
or
surprise
by
night
it
is
one
of
the
few
things
which
can
be
said
in
favour
of
mountaineering
alone
a
practice
which
has
little
besides
to
commend
it
that
it
awakens
a
man
s
faculties
and
makes
him
observe
when
one
has
no
arms
to
help
and
no
head
to
guide
him
except
his
own
he
must
needs
take
note
even
of
small
things
for
he
can
not
afford
to
throw
away
a
chance
and
so
it
came
to
pass
upon
my
solitary
scramble
when
above
the
and
beyond
the
ordinary
limits
of
flowering
plants
when
peering
about
noting
angles
and
landmarks
that
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
tiny
straggling
a
single
flower
on
a
single
of
vegetation
atoms
of
life
in
a
world
of
desolation
which
had
found
their
way
can
tell
how
far
below
and
were
obtaining
bare
sustenance
from
the
scanty
soil
in
protected
nooks
and
it
gave
a
new
interest
to
the
rocks
to
see
what
a
gallant
fight
the
survivors
made
for
many
must
have
perished
in
the
attempt
to
ascend
the
great
mountain
the
gentian
as
one
might
have
expected
was
there
but
it
was
run
close
by
saxifrages
and
by
and
was
beaten
by
which
latter
plant
was
the
highest
i
was
able
to
secure
although
it
too
was
overtopped
by
a
little
white
flower
which
i
knew
not
and
was
unable
to
reach
the
tent
was
safe
although
snowed
up
and
i
turned
to
contemplate
the
view
which
when
seen
alone
and
undisturbed
had
all
the
strength
and
charm
of
complete
novelty
the
highest
peaks
of
the
pennine
chain
were
in
breithorn
feet
the
lyskamm
and
monte
rosa
then
turning
to
the
right
the
entire
block
of
mountains
which
separated
the
val
tournanche
from
the
val
d
ayas
was
seen
at
a
glance
with
its
dominating
summit
the
grand
tournalin
behind
were
the
ranges
dividing
the
val
d
ayas
from
the
valley
of
gressoney
backed
by
higher
summits
more
still
to
the
right
the
eye
wandered
down
the
entire
length
of
the
val
tournanche
and
then
rested
upon
the
graian
alps
with
their
innumerable
peaks
and
upon
the
isolated
pyramid
of
monte
viso
in
the
extreme
distance
next
still
turning
to
the
right
came
the
mountains
intervening
between
the
val
tournanche
and
the
val
barth√©lemy
mont
rouss
a
snowy
summit
which
seems
so
important
from
breil
but
which
is
in
reality
only
a
buttress
of
the
higher
mountain
the
ch√¢teau
des
dames
had
long
ago
sunk
and
the
eye
passed
over
it
scarcely
heeding
its
existence
to
the
becca
salle
or
as
it
is
sometimes
called
bec
de
sale
miniature
to
other
and
more
important
heights
then
the
grand
mass
of
the
dent
d
h√©rens
stopped
the
way
a
noble
mountain
encrusted
on
its
northern
slopes
with
enormous
hanging
glaciers
which
broke
away
at
in
immense
slices
and
thundered
down
on
to
the
tiefenmatten
glacier
and
lastly
most
splendid
of
all
came
the
dent
blanche
soaring
above
the
basin
of
the
great
z
muttgletscher
such
a
view
is
hardly
to
be
excelled
in
the
alps
and
view
is
very
rarely
seen
as
i
saw
it
perfectly
unclouded
time
sped
away
unregarded
and
the
little
birds
which
had
built
their
nests
on
the
neighbouring
cliffs
had
begun
to
chirp
their
evening
hymn
before
i
thought
of
returning
half
mechanically
i
turned
to
the
tent
unrolled
it
and
set
it
up
it
contained
food
enough
for
several
days
and
i
resolved
to
stay
over
the
night
i
had
started
from
breil
without
provisions
or
telling
innkeeper
who
was
accustomed
to
my
erratic
i
was
going
i
returned
to
the
view
the
sun
was
setting
and
its
rosy
rays
blending
with
the
snowy
blue
had
thrown
a
pale
pure
violet
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
valleys
were
drowned
in
purple
gloom
whilst
the
summits
shone
with
unnatural
brightness
and
as
i
sat
in
the
door
of
the
tent
and
watched
the
twilight
change
to
darkness
the
earth
seemed
to
become
less
earthy
and
almost
sublime
the
world
seemed
dead
and
i
its
sole
inhabitant
by
and
by
the
moon
as
it
rose
brought
the
hills
again
into
sight
and
by
a
judicious
repression
of
detail
rendered
the
view
yet
more
magnificent
something
in
the
south
hung
like
a
great
in
the
air
it
was
too
large
for
a
star
and
too
steady
for
a
meteor
and
it
was
long
before
i
could
realise
the
incredible
fact
that
it
was
the
moonlight
glittering
on
the
great
on
the
north
side
of
monte
viso
at
a
distance
as
the
crow
flies
of
miles
shivering
at
last
i
entered
the
tent
and
made
my
coffee
the
night
was
passed
comfortably
and
the
next
morning
tempted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
weather
i
proceeded
yet
higher
in
search
of
another
place
for
a
platform
illustration
climbing
claw
solitary
scrambling
over
a
pretty
wide
area
had
shown
me
that
a
single
individual
is
subjected
to
many
difficulties
which
do
not
trouble
a
party
of
two
or
three
men
and
that
the
disadvantages
of
being
alone
are
more
felt
while
descending
than
during
the
ascent
in
order
to
neutralise
these
inconveniences
i
devised
two
little
appliances
which
were
now
brought
into
use
for
the
first
time
one
was
a
kind
of
five
inches
long
made
of
shear
steel
of
an
inch
thick
this
was
of
use
in
difficult
places
where
there
was
no
hold
within
arm
s
length
but
where
there
were
cracks
or
ledges
some
distance
higher
the
claw
could
be
stuck
on
the
end
of
the
alpenstock
and
dropped
into
such
places
or
on
extreme
occasions
flung
up
until
it
attached
itself
to
something
the
edges
that
laid
hold
of
the
rocks
were
serrated
which
tended
to
make
them
catch
more
readily
the
other
end
had
a
ring
to
which
a
rope
was
fastened
it
must
not
be
understood
that
this
was
employed
for
hauling
one
up
for
any
great
distance
but
that
it
was
used
in
ascending
at
the
most
for
only
a
few
yards
at
a
time
in
descending
however
it
could
be
prudently
used
for
a
greater
distance
at
a
time
as
the
claws
could
be
planted
firmly
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
rope
taut
and
the
pull
constantly
in
the
direction
of
the
length
of
the
implement
otherwise
it
had
a
tendency
to
slip
away
the
second
device
was
merely
a
modification
of
a
dodge
practised
by
all
climbers
it
is
frequently
necessary
for
a
single
man
or
for
the
last
man
of
a
party
during
a
descent
to
make
a
loop
in
the
end
of
his
rope
to
pass
it
over
some
rocks
and
to
come
down
holding
the
free
end
the
loop
is
then
jerked
off
and
the
process
may
be
repeated
but
as
it
sometimes
happens
that
there
are
no
rocks
at
hand
which
will
allow
a
loose
loop
to
be
used
a
has
to
be
resorted
to
and
the
rope
is
drawn
in
tightly
consequently
it
will
occur
that
it
is
not
possible
to
jerk
the
loop
off
and
the
rope
has
to
be
cut
and
left
behind
to
prevent
this
i
had
a
ring
two
and
a
quarter
inches
in
diameter
and
of
an
inch
thick
attached
to
one
end
of
my
rope
a
loop
could
be
made
in
a
moment
by
passing
the
other
end
of
the
rope
through
this
ring
which
of
course
slipped
up
and
held
tightly
as
i
descended
holding
the
free
end
a
strong
piece
of
cord
was
also
attached
to
the
ring
and
on
arriving
at
the
bottom
this
was
pulled
the
ring
slid
back
again
and
the
loop
was
whipped
off
readily
by
means
of
these
two
simple
appliances
i
was
able
to
ascend
and
descend
rocks
which
otherwise
would
have
been
completely
impassable
for
a
single
person
the
combined
weight
of
these
two
things
amounted
to
less
than
illustration
rope
and
rin
it
has
been
mentioned
that
the
rocks
of
the
ridge
are
by
no
means
difficult
for
some
distance
above
the
col
du
lion
this
is
true
of
the
rocks
up
to
the
level
of
the
chimney
but
they
steepen
when
that
is
passed
and
remaining
smooth
and
with
but
few
fractures
and
still
continuing
to
dip
outwards
present
some
steps
of
a
very
uncertain
kind
particularly
when
they
are
glazed
with
ice
at
this
point
just
above
the
chimney
the
climber
is
obliged
to
follow
the
southern
or
breil
side
of
the
ridge
but
in
a
few
feet
more
one
must
turn
over
to
the
northern
or
z
mutt
side
where
in
most
years
nature
kindly
provides
a
when
this
is
surmounted
one
can
again
return
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
follow
it
by
easy
rocks
to
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
this
was
the
highest
point
attained
by
hawkins
in
and
it
was
also
our
highest
on
the
of
july
this
great
tower
is
one
of
the
most
striking
features
of
the
ridge
it
stands
out
like
a
turret
at
the
angle
of
a
castle
behind
it
a
battlemented
wall
leads
upwards
to
the
citadel
seen
from
the
th√©odule
pass
it
looks
only
an
insignificant
pinnacle
but
as
one
approaches
it
on
the
ridge
so
it
seems
to
rise
and
when
one
is
at
its
base
it
completely
conceals
the
upper
parts
of
the
mountain
i
found
here
a
suitable
place
for
the
tent
which
although
not
so
well
protected
as
the
second
platform
possessed
the
advantage
of
being
feet
higher
up
and
fascinated
by
the
wildness
of
the
cliffs
and
enticed
by
the
perfection
of
the
weather
i
went
on
to
see
what
was
behind
the
first
step
was
a
difficult
one
the
ridge
became
diminished
to
the
least
possible
was
hard
to
keep
one
s
just
where
it
was
narrowest
a
more
than
perpendicular
mass
barred
the
way
nothing
fairly
within
arm
s
reach
could
be
laid
hold
of
it
was
necessary
to
spring
up
and
then
to
haul
one
over
the
sharp
edge
by
sheer
strength
progression
directly
upwards
was
then
impossible
enormous
and
appalling
precipices
plunged
down
to
the
tiefenmatten
glacier
on
the
left
but
round
the
side
it
was
just
possible
to
go
one
hindrance
then
succeeded
another
and
much
time
was
consumed
in
seeking
the
way
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
a
gully
of
more
than
usual
perplexity
at
the
side
of
the
great
tower
with
minute
ledges
and
steep
walls
of
the
ledges
dwindling
down
and
at
last
ceasing
and
of
finding
myself
with
arms
and
legs
divergent
fixed
as
if
crucified
pressing
against
the
rock
and
feeling
each
rise
and
fall
of
my
chest
as
i
breathed
of
screwing
my
head
round
to
look
for
hold
and
not
seeing
any
and
of
jumping
sideways
on
to
the
other
side
tis
vain
to
attempt
to
describe
such
places
whether
they
are
sketched
with
a
light
hand
or
wrought
out
in
laborious
detail
one
stands
an
equal
chance
of
being
misunderstood
their
enchantment
to
the
climber
arises
from
their
calls
on
his
faculties
in
their
demands
on
his
strength
and
on
overcoming
the
impediments
which
they
oppose
to
his
skill
the
reader
can
not
feel
this
and
his
interest
in
descriptions
of
such
places
is
usually
small
unless
he
supposes
that
the
situations
are
perilous
they
are
not
necessarily
perilous
but
i
think
that
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
giving
such
an
impression
if
the
difficulties
are
particularly
insisted
upon
about
this
part
there
was
a
change
in
the
quality
of
the
rock
and
there
was
a
change
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
ridge
the
rocks
talcose
gneiss
below
this
spot
were
singularly
firm
it
was
rarely
necessary
to
test
one
s
hold
the
way
led
over
the
living
rock
and
not
up
fragments
but
here
all
was
decay
and
ruin
the
crest
of
the
ridge
was
shattered
and
cleft
and
the
feet
sank
in
the
chips
which
had
drifted
down
while
above
huge
blocks
hacked
and
carved
by
the
hand
of
time
nodded
to
the
sky
looking
like
the
of
giants
out
of
curiosity
i
wandered
to
a
notch
in
the
ridge
between
two
tottering
piles
of
immense
masses
which
seemed
to
need
but
a
few
pounds
on
one
or
the
other
side
to
make
them
fall
so
nicely
poised
that
they
would
literally
have
rocked
in
the
wind
for
they
were
put
in
motion
by
a
touch
and
based
on
support
so
frail
that
i
wondered
they
did
not
collapse
before
my
eyes
in
the
whole
range
of
my
alpine
experience
i
have
seen
nothing
more
striking
than
this
desolate
ruined
and
shattered
ridge
at
the
back
of
the
great
tower
i
have
seen
stranger
shapes
which
mimic
the
human
form
with
monstrous
leering
isolated
pinnacles
sharper
and
greater
than
any
here
but
i
have
never
seen
exhibited
so
impressively
the
tremendous
effects
which
may
be
produced
by
frost
and
by
the
action
of
forces
whose
individual
effects
are
barely
perceptible
it
is
needless
to
say
that
it
is
impossible
to
climb
by
the
crest
of
the
ridge
at
this
part
still
one
is
compelled
to
keep
near
to
it
for
there
is
no
other
way
generally
speaking
the
angles
on
the
matterhorn
are
too
steep
to
allow
the
formation
of
considerable
beds
of
snow
but
here
there
is
a
corner
which
permits
it
to
accumulate
and
it
is
turned
to
gratefully
for
by
its
assistance
one
can
ascend
four
times
as
rapidly
as
upon
the
rocks
the
tower
was
now
almost
out
of
sight
and
i
looked
over
the
central
pennine
alps
to
the
grand
combin
and
to
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
my
neighbour
the
dent
d
h√©rens
still
rose
above
me
although
but
slightly
and
the
height
which
had
been
attained
could
be
measured
by
its
help
so
far
i
had
no
doubts
about
my
capacity
to
descend
that
which
had
been
ascended
but
in
a
short
time
on
looking
ahead
i
saw
that
the
cliffs
steepened
and
i
turned
back
without
pushing
on
to
them
and
getting
into
inextricable
difficulties
exulting
in
the
thought
that
they
would
be
passed
when
we
returned
together
and
that
i
had
without
assistance
got
nearly
to
the
height
of
the
dent
d
h√©rens
and
considerably
higher
than
any
one
had
been
before
my
exultation
was
a
little
premature
about
i
left
the
tent
again
and
thought
myself
as
good
as
at
breil
the
friendly
rope
and
claw
had
done
good
service
and
had
smoothened
all
the
difficulties
i
lowered
myself
through
the
chimney
however
by
making
a
fixture
of
the
rope
which
i
then
cut
off
and
left
behind
as
there
was
enough
and
to
spare
my
axe
had
proved
a
great
nuisance
in
coming
down
and
i
left
it
in
the
tent
it
was
not
attached
to
the
b√¢ton
but
was
a
separate
affair
old
navy
while
cutting
up
the
different
on
the
ascent
the
b√¢ton
trailed
behind
fastened
to
the
rope
and
when
climbing
the
axe
was
carried
behind
run
through
the
rope
tied
round
my
waist
and
was
sufficiently
out
of
the
way
but
in
descending
when
coming
down
face
outwards
as
is
always
best
where
it
is
possible
the
head
or
the
handle
of
the
weapon
caught
frequently
against
the
rocks
and
several
times
nearly
upset
me
so
out
of
laziness
if
you
will
it
was
left
in
the
tent
i
paid
dearly
for
the
imprudence
the
col
du
lion
was
passed
and
fifty
yards
more
would
have
placed
me
on
the
great
staircase
down
which
one
can
run
but
on
arriving
at
an
angle
of
the
cliffs
of
the
t√™te
du
lion
while
skirting
the
upper
edge
of
the
snow
which
abuts
against
them
i
found
that
the
heat
of
the
two
past
days
had
nearly
obliterated
the
steps
which
had
been
cut
when
coming
up
the
rocks
happened
to
be
impracticable
just
at
this
corner
so
nothing
could
be
done
except
make
the
steps
afresh
the
snow
was
too
hard
to
beat
or
tread
down
and
at
the
angle
it
was
all
but
ice
steps
only
were
required
and
then
the
ledges
could
be
followed
again
so
i
held
to
the
rock
with
my
right
hand
and
prodded
at
the
snow
with
the
point
of
my
stick
until
a
good
step
was
made
and
then
leaning
round
the
angle
did
the
same
for
the
other
side
so
far
well
but
in
attempting
to
pass
the
corner
to
the
present
moment
i
can
not
tell
how
it
happened
i
slipped
and
fell
illustration
the
on
the
ridge
of
the
matterhorn
the
slope
was
steep
on
which
this
took
place
and
was
at
the
top
of
a
gully
that
led
down
through
two
subordinate
buttresses
towards
the
glacier
du
was
just
seen
a
thousand
feet
below
the
gully
narrowed
and
narrowed
until
there
was
a
mere
thread
of
snow
lying
between
two
walls
of
rock
which
came
to
an
abrupt
termination
at
the
top
of
a
precipice
that
intervened
between
it
and
the
glacier
imagine
a
funnel
cut
in
half
through
its
length
placed
at
an
angle
of
degrees
with
its
point
below
and
its
concave
side
uppermost
and
you
will
have
a
fair
idea
of
the
place
the
knapsack
brought
my
head
down
first
and
i
pitched
into
some
rocks
about
a
dozen
feet
below
they
caught
something
and
tumbled
me
off
the
edge
head
over
heels
into
the
gully
the
b√¢ton
was
dashed
from
my
hands
and
i
whirled
downwards
in
a
series
of
bounds
each
longer
than
the
last
now
over
ice
now
into
rocks
striking
my
head
four
or
five
times
each
time
with
increased
force
the
last
bound
sent
me
spinning
through
the
air
in
a
leap
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
from
one
side
of
the
gully
to
the
other
and
i
struck
the
rocks
luckily
with
the
whole
of
my
left
side
they
caught
my
clothes
for
a
moment
and
i
fell
back
on
to
the
snow
with
motion
arrested
my
head
fortunately
came
the
right
side
up
and
a
few
frantic
catches
brought
me
to
a
halt
in
the
neck
of
the
gully
and
on
the
verge
of
the
precipice
b√¢ton
hat
and
veil
skimmed
by
and
disappeared
and
the
crash
of
the
i
had
they
fell
on
to
the
glacier
told
how
narrow
had
been
the
escape
from
utter
destruction
as
it
was
i
fell
nearly
feet
in
seven
or
eight
bounds
ten
feet
more
would
have
taken
me
in
one
gigantic
leap
of
feet
on
to
the
glacier
below
the
situation
was
sufficiently
serious
the
rocks
could
not
be
left
go
for
a
moment
and
the
blood
was
spirting
out
of
more
than
twenty
cuts
the
most
serious
ones
were
in
the
head
and
i
vainly
tried
to
close
them
with
one
hand
whilst
holding
on
with
the
other
it
was
useless
the
blood
jerked
out
in
blinding
jets
at
each
pulsation
at
last
in
a
moment
of
inspiration
i
kicked
out
a
big
lump
of
snow
and
stuck
it
as
a
plaster
on
my
head
the
idea
was
a
happy
one
and
the
flow
of
blood
diminished
then
scrambling
up
i
got
not
a
moment
too
soon
to
a
place
of
safety
and
fainted
away
the
sun
was
setting
when
consciousness
returned
and
it
was
pitch
dark
before
the
great
staircase
was
descended
but
by
a
combination
of
luck
and
care
the
whole
feet
of
descent
to
breil
was
accomplished
without
a
slip
or
once
missing
the
way
i
slunk
past
the
cabin
of
the
cowherds
who
were
talking
and
laughing
inside
utterly
ashamed
of
the
state
to
which
i
had
been
brought
by
my
imbecility
and
entered
the
inn
stealthily
wishing
to
escape
to
my
room
unnoticed
but
favre
met
me
in
the
passage
demanded
who
is
it
screamed
with
fright
when
he
got
a
light
and
aroused
the
household
two
dozen
heads
then
held
solemn
council
over
mine
with
more
talk
than
action
the
natives
were
unanimous
in
recommending
that
hot
wine
syn
vinegar
mixed
with
salt
should
be
rubbed
into
the
cuts
i
protested
but
they
insisted
it
was
all
the
doctoring
they
received
whether
their
rapid
healing
was
to
be
attributed
to
that
simple
remedy
or
to
a
good
state
of
health
is
a
question
they
closed
up
remarkably
quickly
and
in
a
few
days
i
was
able
to
move
again

attempting
to
pass
the
corner
i
slipped
and
illustration
at
breil
giomein
it
was
sufficiently
dull
during
this
time
i
was
chiefly
occupied
in
meditating
on
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
and
in
watching
my
clothes
being
washed
in
the
tub
which
was
turned
by
the
stream
in
the
front
of
the
house
and
i
vowed
that
if
an
englishman
should
at
any
time
fall
sick
in
the
val
tournanche
he
should
not
feel
so
solitary
as
i
did
at
this
dreary
time
the
news
of
the
accident
brought
carrel
up
to
breil
and
along
with
the
haughty
chasseur
came
one
of
his
relatives
a
strong
and
able
young
fellow
named
c√¶sar
with
these
two
men
and
meynet
i
made
another
start
on
the
of
july
we
got
to
the
tent
without
any
trouble
and
on
the
following
day
had
ascended
beyond
the
tower
and
were
picking
our
way
cautiously
over
the
loose
rocks
behind
where
my
traces
of
the
week
before
were
well
apparent
in
lovely
weather
when
one
of
those
abominable
and
almost
instantaneous
changes
occurred
to
which
the
matterhorn
is
so
liable
on
its
southern
side
mists
were
created
out
of
invisible
vapours
and
in
a
few
minutes
snow
fell
heavily
we
stopped
as
this
part
was
of
excessive
difficulty
and
unwilling
to
retreat
remained
on
the
spot
several
hours
in
hopes
that
another
change
would
occur
but
as
it
did
not
we
at
length
went
down
to
the
base
of
the
tower
and
commenced
to
make
a
third
platform
at
the
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
it
still
continued
to
snow
and
we
took
refuge
in
the
tent
carrel
argued
that
the
weather
had
broken
up
and
that
the
mountain
would
become
so
glazed
with
ice
as
to
render
any
attempt
futile
and
i
that
the
change
was
only
temporary
and
that
the
rocks
were
too
hot
to
allow
ice
to
form
upon
them
i
wished
to
stay
until
the
weather
improved
but
my
leader
would
not
endure
contradiction
grew
more
positive
and
insisted
that
we
must
go
down
we
went
down
and
when
we
got
below
the
col
his
opinion
was
found
to
be
wrong
the
cloud
was
confined
to
the
upper
feet
and
outside
it
there
was
brilliant
weather
carrel
was
not
an
easy
man
to
manage
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
was
the
cock
of
the
val
tournanche
and
he
commanded
the
other
men
as
by
right
he
was
equally
conscious
that
he
was
indispensable
to
me
and
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
knowledge
of
the
fact
if
he
had
been
commanded
or
if
he
had
been
entreated
to
stop
it
would
have
been
all
the
same
but
let
me
repeat
he
was
the
only
climber
i
could
find
who
believed
that
the
mountain
was
not
inaccessible
with
him
i
had
hopes
but
without
him
none
so
he
was
allowed
to
do
as
he
would
his
will
on
this
occasion
was
almost
incomprehensible
he
certainly
could
not
be
charged
with
cowardice
for
a
bolder
man
could
hardly
be
found
nor
was
he
turning
away
on
account
of
difficulty
for
nothing
to
which
we
had
yet
come
seemed
to
be
difficult
to
and
his
strong
personal
desire
to
make
the
ascent
was
evident
there
was
no
occasion
to
come
down
on
account
of
food
for
we
had
taken
to
guard
against
this
very
casualty
enough
to
last
for
a
week
and
there
was
no
danger
and
little
or
no
discomfort
in
stopping
in
the
tent
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
spinning
out
the
ascent
for
his
own
purposes
and
that
although
he
wished
very
much
to
be
the
first
man
on
the
top
and
did
not
object
to
be
accompanied
by
any
one
else
who
had
the
same
wish
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
one
succeed
too
soon
to
give
a
greater
appearance
of
when
the
thing
was
accomplished
as
he
feared
no
rival
he
may
have
supposed
that
the
more
difficulties
he
made
the
more
valuable
he
would
be
estimated
though
to
do
him
justice
he
never
showed
any
great
hunger
for
money
his
demands
were
fair
not
excessive
but
he
always
stipulated
for
so
much
per
day
and
so
under
any
circumstances
he
did
not
do
badly
vexed
at
having
my
time
thus
frittered
away
i
was
still
well
pleased
when
he
volunteered
to
start
again
on
the
morrow
if
it
should
be
fine
we
were
to
advance
the
tent
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
to
fix
ropes
in
the
most
difficult
parts
beyond
and
to
make
a
push
for
the
summit
on
the
following
day
the
next
morning
friday
the
when
i
arose
good
little
meynet
was
ready
and
waiting
and
he
said
that
the
two
carrels
had
gone
off
some
time
before
and
had
left
word
that
they
intended
as
the
day
was
favourable
for
that
sport
my
holiday
had
nearly
expired
and
these
men
clearly
could
not
be
relied
upon
so
as
a
last
resort
i
proposed
to
the
hunchback
to
accompany
me
alone
to
see
if
we
could
not
get
higher
than
before
though
of
reaching
the
summit
there
was
little
or
no
hope
he
did
not
hesitate
and
in
a
few
hours
we
the
third
time
the
col
du
lion
it
was
the
first
time
meynet
had
seen
the
view
unclouded
the
poor
little
deformed
peasant
gazed
upon
it
silently
and
reverently
for
a
time
and
then
unconsciously
fell
on
one
knee
in
an
attitude
of
adoration
and
clasped
his
hands
exclaiming
in
ecstasy
oh
beautiful
mountains
his
actions
were
as
appropriate
as
his
words
were
natural
and
tears
bore
witness
to
the
reality
of
his
emotion
our
power
was
too
limited
to
advance
the
tent
so
we
slept
at
the
old
station
and
starting
very
early
the
next
morning
passed
the
place
where
we
had
turned
back
on
the
and
subsequently
my
highest
point
on
the
we
found
the
crest
of
the
ridge
so
treacherous
that
we
took
to
the
cliffs
on
the
right
although
most
unwillingly
little
by
little
we
fought
our
way
up
but
at
length
we
were
both
on
the
all
but
perpendicular
face
unable
to
advance
and
barely
able
to
descend
we
returned
to
the
ridge
it
was
almost
equally
difficult
and
infinitely
more
unstable
and
at
length
after
having
pushed
our
attempts
as
far
as
was
prudent
i
determined
to
return
to
breil
and
to
have
a
light
ladder
made
to
assist
us
to
overcome
some
of
the
steepest
parts
i
expected
too
that
by
this
time
carrel
would
have
had
enough
and
would
deign
to
accompany
us
again
we
came
down
at
a
great
pace
for
we
were
now
so
familiar
with
the
mountain
and
with
each
other
s
wants
that
we
knew
immediately
when
to
give
a
helping
hand
and
when
to
let
alone
the
rocks
also
were
in
a
better
state
than
i
have
ever
seen
them
being
almost
entirely
free
from
glaze
of
ice
meynet
was
always
merriest
on
the
difficult
parts
and
on
the
most
difficult
kept
on
enunciating
the
sentiment
we
can
only
die
once
which
thought
seemed
to
afford
him
infinite
satisfaction
we
arrived
at
the
inn
early
in
the
evening
and
i
found
my
projects
summarily
and
unexpectedly
knocked
on
the
head
professor
tyndall
had
arrived
while
we
were
absent
and
he
had
engaged
both
c√¶sar
and
carrel
bennen
was
also
with
him
together
with
a
powerful
and
active
friend
a
valaisan
guide
named
anton
walter
they
had
a
ladder
already
prepared
provisions
were
being
collected
and
they
intended
to
start
on
the
following
morning
sunday
this
new
arrival
took
me
by
surprise
bennen
it
will
be
remembered
refused
to
take
professor
tyndall
on
the
matterhorn
in
he
was
dead
against
any
attempt
on
the
mountain
says
tyndall
he
was
now
eager
to
set
out
professor
tyndall
has
not
explained
in
what
way
this
revolution
came
about
in
his
guide
i
was
equally
astonished
at
the
faithlessness
of
carrel
and
attributed
it
to
pique
at
our
having
presumed
to
do
without
him
it
was
useless
to
compete
with
the
professor
and
his
four
men
who
were
ready
to
start
in
a
few
hours
so
i
waited
to
see
what
would
come
of
their
attempt
everything
seemed
to
favour
it
and
they
set
out
on
a
fine
morning
in
high
spirits
leaving
me
tormented
with
envy
and
all
uncharitableness
if
they
succeeded
they
carried
off
the
prize
for
which
i
had
been
so
long
struggling
and
if
they
failed
there
was
no
time
to
make
another
attempt
for
i
was
due
in
a
few
days
more
in
london
when
this
came
home
clearly
to
me
i
resolved
to
leave
breil
at
once
but
when
packing
up
found
that
some
necessaries
had
been
left
behind
in
the
tent
so
i
went
off
about
midday
to
recover
them
caught
the
army
of
the
professor
before
it
reached
the
col
as
they
were
going
very
slowly
left
them
there
stopping
to
take
food
and
went
on
to
the
tent
i
was
near
to
it
when
all
at
once
i
heard
a
noise
aloft
and
on
looking
up
perceived
a
stone
of
at
least
a
foot
cube
flying
straight
at
my
head
i
ducked
and
scrambled
under
the
lee
side
of
a
friendly
rock
while
the
stone
went
by
with
a
loud
buzz
it
was
the
advanced
guard
of
a
perfect
storm
of
stones
which
descended
with
infernal
clatter
down
the
very
edge
of
the
ridge
leaving
a
trail
of
dust
behind
with
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
that
told
who
had
sent
them
the
men
below
were
on
the
but
the
stones
did
not
come
near
them
and
breaking
away
on
one
side
went
down
to
the
glacier
du
lion
i
waited
at
the
tent
to
welcome
the
professor
and
when
he
arrived
went
down
to
breil
early
next
morning
some
one
ran
to
me
saying
that
a
flag
was
seen
on
the
summit
of
the
matterhorn
it
was
not
so
however
although
i
saw
that
they
had
passed
the
place
where
we
had
turned
back
on
the
i
had
now
no
doubt
of
their
final
success
for
they
had
got
beyond
the
point
which
carrel
not
less
than
myself
had
always
considered
to
be
the
most
questionable
place
on
the
whole
mountain
up
to
it
there
was
no
choice
of
route
suppose
that
at
no
one
point
between
it
and
the
col
was
it
possible
to
diverge
a
dozen
paces
to
the
right
or
left
but
beyond
it
it
was
otherwise
and
we
had
always
agreed
in
our
debates
that
if
it
could
be
passed
success
was
certain
the
accompanying
outline
from
a
sketch
taken
from
the
door
of
the
inn
at
breil
will
help
to
explain
the
letter
indicates
the
position
of
the
great
tower
the
cravate
the
streak
of
snow
referred
to
on
and
which
we
just
failed
to
arrive
at
on
the
the
place
where
we
now
saw
something
that
looked
like
a
flag
behind
the
point
b
a
nearly
level
ridge
leads
up
to
the
foot
of
the
final
peak
which
will
be
understood
by
a
reference
to
the
outline
facing
on
which
the
same
letters
indicate
the
same
places
it
was
just
now
said
we
considered
that
if
the
point
could
be
passed
success
was
certain
tyndall
was
at
very
early
in
the
morning
and
i
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
reach
the
summit
although
it
yet
remained
problematical
whether
he
would
be
able
to
stand
on
the
very
highest
point
the
summit
was
evidently
formed
of
a
long
ridge
on
which
there
were
two
points
nearly
equally
equally
that
one
could
not
say
which
was
the
between
the
two
there
seemed
to
be
a
deep
notch
marked
on
the
outlines
which
might
defeat
one
at
the
very
last
moment
illustration

cannonade

the
matterhorn
from

my
knapsack
was
packed
and
i
had
taken
a
parting
glass
of
wine
with
favre
who
was
jubilant
at
the
success
which
was
to
make
the
fortune
of
his
inn
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
leave
until
the
result
was
heard
and
lingered
about
as
a
foolish
lover
hovers
round
the
object
of
his
affections
even
after
he
has
been
contemptuously
rejected
the
sun
had
set
before
the
men
were
descried
coming
over
the
pastures
there
was
no
spring
in
their
too
were
defeated
the
carrels
hid
their
heads
and
the
others
said
as
men
will
do
when
they
have
been
beaten
that
the
mountain
was
horrible
impossible
and
so
forth
professor
tyndall
told
me
they
had
arrived
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
and
admonished
me
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
mountain
i
understood
him
to
say
that
he
should
not
try
again
and
ran
down
to
the
village
of
val
tournanche
almost
inclined
to
believe
that
the
mountain
was
inaccessible
leaving
the
tent
ropes
and
other
matters
in
the
hands
of
favre
to
be
placed
at
the
disposal
of
any
person
who
wished
to
ascend
it

am
afraid
out
of
irony
than
from
generosity
there
may
have
been
those
who
believed
that
the
matterhorn
could
be
ascended
but
anyhow
their
faith
did
not
bring
forth
works
no
one
tried
again
in
business
took
me
into
dauphin√©
before
returning
to
london
and
a
week
after
tyndall
s
defeat
i
lay
one
night
after
a
sultry
day
tossing
about
in
one
of
the
abominations
which
serve
for
beds
in
the
inn
kept
by
the
of
la
ville
de
val
louise
looking
at
a
strange
ruddiness
on
the
ceiling
which
i
thought
might
be
some
effect
of
electricity
produced
by
the
irritation
of
the
myriads
of
fleas
when
the
great
bell
of
the
church
close
at
hand
pealed
out
with
loud
and
hurried
clangour
i
jumped
up
for
the
voices
and
movements
of
the
people
in
the
house
made
me
think
of
fire
it
fire
and
i
saw
from
my
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
great
forked
flames
shooting
high
into
the
sky
black
dots
with
long
shadows
hurrying
towards
the
place
and
the
crests
of
the
ridges
catching
the
light
and
standing
out
like
spectres
all
the
world
was
in
motion
for
the
neighbouring
out
the
alarm
i
pulled
on
my
shirt
and
tore
over
the
bridge
three
large
chalets
were
on
fire
and
were
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
people
who
were
bringing
all
their
pots
and
pans
and
anything
that
would
hold
water
they
formed
themselves
into
several
chains
each
two
deep
leading
towards
the
nearest
stream
and
passed
the
water
up
one
side
and
the
empty
utensils
down
the
other
my
old
friend
the
mayor
was
there
in
full
force
striking
the
ground
with
his
stick
and
vociferating
work
work
but
the
men
with
much
presence
of
mind
chiefly
ranged
themselves
on
the
sides
of
the
empty
buckets
and
left
the
real
work
to
their
better
halves
their
efforts
were
useless
and
the
chalets
burnt
themselves
out
the
next
morning
i
visited
the
still
smouldering
ruins
and
saw
the
homeless
families
sitting
in
a
dismal
row
in
front
of
their
charred
property
the
people
said
that
one
of
the
houses
had
been
well
insured
and
that
its
owner
had
endeavoured
to
forestall
luck
he
had
arranged
the
place
for
a
bonfire
set
the
lower
rooms
on
fire
in
several
places
and
had
then
gone
out
of
the
way
leaving
his
wife
and
children
in
the
upper
rooms
to
be
roasted
or
not
as
the
case
might
be
his
plans
only
partially
succeeded

it
was
satisfactory

see
the
scoundrel
brought

used
by
firemen
and
shut
up
like
parallel
rulers
my
luggage
was
highly
suggestive
of
housebreaking
for
besides
these
there
were
several
coils
of
rope
and
numerous
tools
of
suspicious
appearance
and
it
was
reluctantly
admitted
into
france
but
it
passed
through
the
with
less
trouble
than
i
anticipated
after
a
timely
expenditure
of
a
few
francs
i
am
not
in
love
with
the
douane
it
is
the
purgatory
of
travellers
where
uncongenial
spirits
mingle
together
for
a
time
before
they
are
separated
into
rich
and
poor
the
douaniers
look
upon
tourists
as
their
natural
enemies
see
how
eagerly
they
pounce
upon
the
portmanteaux
one
of
them
has
discovered
something
he
has
never
seen
its
like
before
and
he
holds
it
aloft
in
the
face
of
its
owner
with
inquisitorial
insolence
but
this
the
explanation
is
only
but
what
is
says
he
laying
hold
of
a
little
box
but
that
it
is
forbidden
to
carry
of
powder
on
the
bah
says
another
and
older
hand
pass
the
effects
of
monsieur
and
our
cheeks
had
begun
to
redden
under
the
stares
of
his
allowed
to
depart
with
his
while
the
discomfited
douanier
gives
a
mighty
shrug
at
the
strange
habits
of
those
whose
insular
position
excludes
them
from
the
march
of
continental
my
real
troubles
commenced
at
susa
the
officials
there
more
honest
and
more
obtuse
than
the
frenchmen
declined
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
be
bribed
or
to
pass
my
baggage
until
a
satisfactory
account
of
it
was
rendered
and
as
they
refused
to
believe
the
true
explanation
i
was
puzzled
what
to
say
but
was
presently
relieved
from
the
dilemma
by
one
of
the
men
who
was
cleverer
than
his
fellows
suggesting
that
i
was
going
to
turin
to
exhibit
in
the
streets
that
i
mounted
the
ladder
and
balanced
myself
on
the
end
of
it
then
lighted
my
pipe
and
put
the
point
of
the
b√¢ton
in
its
bowl
and
caused
the
b√¢ton
to
gyrate
around
my
head
the
rope
was
to
keep
back
the
spectators
and
an
englishman
in
my
company
was
the
agent
monsieur
is
acrobat
then
yes
pass
the
effects
of
monsieur
the
acrobat
these
ladders
were
the
source
of
endless
trouble
let
us
pass
over
the
doubts
of
the
guardians
of
the
h√¥tel
d
europe
trombetta
whether
a
person
in
the
possession
of
such
questionable
articles
should
be
admitted
to
their
very
respectable
house
and
get
to
chatillon
at
the
entrance
of
the
val
tournanche
a
mule
was
chartered
to
carry
them
and
as
they
were
too
long
to
sling
across
its
back
they
were
arranged
lengthways
and
one
end
projected
over
the
animal
s
head
while
the
other
extended
beyond
its
tail
a
mule
when
going
up
or
down
hill
always
moves
with
a
jerky
action
and
in
consequence
of
this
the
ladders
hit
my
mule
severe
blows
between
its
ears
and
in
its
flanks
the
beast
not
knowing
what
strange
creature
it
had
on
its
back
naturally
tossed
its
head
and
threw
out
its
legs
and
this
of
course
only
made
the
blows
that
it
received
more
severe
at
last
it
ran
away
and
would
have
perished
by
rolling
down
a
precipice
if
the
men
had
not
caught
hold
of
its
tail
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
a
man
had
to
follow
the
mule
holding
the
end
of
the
ladders
which
obliged
him
to
move
his
arms
up
and
down
incessantly
and
to
bow
to
the
hind
quarters
of
the
animal
in
a
way
that
afforded
more
amusement
to
his
comrades
than
it
did
to
him
i
was
once
more
for
the
matterhorn
for
i
had
heard
in
the
spring
of
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
professor
tyndall
and
learnt
that
the
case
was
not
so
hopeless
as
it
appeared
to
be
at
one
time
i
found
that
he
arrived
as
far
only
as
the
northern
end
of
the
the
point
at
which
he
says
they
sat
down
with
broken
hopes
the
summit
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
us
but
still
defying
us
was
not
the
notch
or
cleft
at
d
which
is
literally
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
summit
but
another
and
more
formidable
cleft
that
intervenes
between
the
northern
end
of
the
shoulder
and
the
commencement
of
the
final
peak
it
is
marked
e
on
the
outline
which
faces
carrel
and
all
the
men
who
had
been
with
me
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
cleft
and
of
the
pinnacle
which
rose
between
it
and
the
final
peak
and
we
had
frequently
talked
about
the
best
manner
of
passing
the
place
on
this
we
disagreed
but
we
were
both
of
opinion
that
when
we
got
to
the
shoulder
it
would
be
necessary
to
bear
down
gradually
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
to
avoid
coming
to
the
top
of
the
notch
tyndall
s
party
after
arriving
at
the
shoulder
was
led
by
his
guides
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
consequently
when
they
got
to
its
northern
end
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
notch
instead
of
the
the
dismay
of
all
but
the
carrels
tyndall
s
words
are
the
ridge
was
here
split
by
a
deep
cleft
which
separated
it
from
the
final
precipice
and
the
case
became
more
hopeless
as
we
came
more
the
professor
adds
the
mountain
is
feet
high
and
feet
had
been
he
greatly
deceived
himself
by
the
barometric
measurements
of
signor
giordano
the
notch
is
no
less
than
feet
below
the
summit
the
guide
walter
tyndall
says
said
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
and
the
carrels
appealed
to
for
their
opinion
this
is
their
own
account
gave
as
an
answer
we
are
porters
ask
your
bennen
thus
left
to
himself
was
finally
forced
to
accept
tyndall
had
nevertheless
accomplished
an
advance
of
about
feet
over
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
mountain
there
are
material
discrepancies
between
the
published
narratives
of
professor
tyndall
and
the
verbal
accounts
of
the
carrels
the
former
says
the
men
had
to
be
urged
on
that
they
pronounced
flatly
against
the
final
precipice
they
yielded
so
utterly
and
that
bennen
said
in
answer
to
a
final
appeal
made
to
him
what
could
i
do
sir
not
one
of
them
would
accompany
it
was
the
accurate
carrel
says
that
when
professor
tyndall
gave
the
order
to
turn
would
have
advanced
to
examine
the
route
as
he
did
not
think
that
farther
progress
was
impossible
but
he
was
stopped
by
the
professor
and
was
naturally
obliged
to
follow
the
others
these
disagreements
may
well
be
left
to
be
settled
by
those
who
are
concerned

an
arch
of
the
aqueduct
in
the
val
tournanche
the
val
tournanche
is
one
of
the
most
charming
valleys
in
the
italian
alps
it
is
a
paradise
to
an
artist
and
if
the
space
at
my
command
were
greater
i
would
willingly
linger
over
its
groves
of
chestnuts
its
bright
trickling
rills
and
its
roaring
torrents
its
upland
unsuspected
valleys
and
its
noble
cliffs
the
path
rises
steeply
from
chatillon
but
it
is
well
shaded
and
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
is
tempered
by
cool
air
and
spray
which
comes
off
the
streams
one
sees
from
the
path
at
several
places
on
the
right
bank
of
the
valley
groups
of
arches
which
have
been
built
high
up
against
the
faces
of
the
cliffs
whose
authority
i
know
they
are
the
remains
of
a
roman
aqueduct
they
have
the
roman
boldness
of
conception
but
the
work
has
not
the
usual
roman
solidity
the
arches
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
remains
of
an
work
and
i
learn
from
carrel
that
there
are
other
groups
of
arches
which
are
not
seen
from
the
path
all
having
the
same
appearance
it
may
be
questioned
whether
those
seen
near
the
village
of
antey
are
roman
some
of
them
are
semicircular
whilst
others
are
distinctly
pointed
here
is
one
of
the
latter
which
might
pass
for
work
or
later
arch
with
mean
voussoirs
and
the
masonry
in
rough
courses
these
arches
are
well
worth
the
attention
of
an
arch√¶ologist
but
some
difficulty
will
be
found
in
approaching
them
closely
we
sauntered
up
the
valley
and
got
to
breil
when
all
were
asleep
a
halo
round
the
moon
promised
watery
weather
and
we
were
not
disappointed
for
on
the
next
day
august
rain
fell
heavily
and
when
the
clouds
lifted
for
a
time
we
saw
that
new
snow
lay
thickly
over
everything
higher
than
feet
carrel
was
ready
and
waiting
as
i
had
determined
to
give
the
bold
cragsman
another
chance
and
he
did
not
need
to
say
that
the
matterhorn
would
be
impracticable
for
several
days
after
all
this
new
snow
even
if
the
weather
were
to
arrange
itself
at
once
our
first
day
together
was
accordingly
spent
upon
a
neighbouring
summit
the
cimes
blanches
a
degraded
mountain
well
known
for
its
fine
panoramic
view
it
was
little
that
we
saw
for
in
every
direction
except
to
the
south
writhing
masses
of
heavy
clouds
obscured
everything
and
to
the
south
our
view
was
intercepted
by
a
peak
higher
than
the
cimes
blanches
named
the
grand
tournalin
but
we
got
some
innocent
pleasure
out
of
watching
the
gambolings
of
a
number
of
goats
who
became
fast
friends
after
we
had
given
them
some
salt
in
fact
too
fast
and
caused
us
no
little
annoyance
when
we
were
descending
carrel
i
said
as
a
number
of
stones
whizzed
by
which
they
had
dislodged
this
must
be
put
a
stop
diable
he
grunted
it
is
very
well
to
talk
but
how
will
you
do
it
i
said
that
i
would
try
and
sitting
down
poured
a
little
brandy
into
the
hollow
of
my
hand
and
allured
the
nearest
goat
with
deceitful
gestures
it
was
one
who
had
gobbled
up
the
paper
in
which
the
salt
had
been
animal
of
enterprising
it
advanced
fearlessly
and
licked
up
the
brandy
i
shall
not
easily
forget
its
surprise
it
stopped
short
and
coughed
and
looked
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
oh
you
cheat
and
spat
and
ran
away
stopping
now
and
then
to
cough
and
spit
again
we
were
not
troubled
any
more
by
those
goats
more
snow
fell
during
the
night
and
our
attempt
on
the
matterhorn
was
postponed
indefinitely
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
at
breil
i
determined
to
make
the
tour
of
the
mountain
and
commenced
by
inventing
a
pass
from
breil
to
zermatt
in
place
of
the
hackneyed
th√©odule
any
one
who
looks
at
the
map
will
see
that
the
latter
pass
makes
a
considerable
d√©tour
to
the
east
and
apparently
goes
out
of
the
way
i
thought
that
it
was
possible
to
strike
out
a
shorter
route
both
in
distance
and
in
time
and
we
set
out
on
the
of
august
to
carry
out
the
idea
we
followed
the
th√©odule
path
for
some
time
but
quitted
it
when
it
bore
away
to
the
east
and
kept
straight
on
until
we
struck
the
moraine
of
the
mont
cervin
glacier
our
track
still
continued
in
a
straight
line
up
the
centre
of
the
glacier
to
the
foot
of
a
tooth
of
rock
which
juts
prominently
out
of
the
ridge
furggengrat
connecting
the
matterhorn
with
the
th√©odulehorn
the
head
of
the
glacier
was
connected
with
this
little
peak
by
a
steep
bank
of
snow
but
we
were
able
to
go
straight
up
and
struck
the
col
at
its
lowest
point
a
little
to
the
right
that
is
to
say
to
the
east
of
the
peak
on
the
north
there
was
a
corresponding
to
that
on
the
other
side
took
us
to
its
base
we
then
bore
away
over
the
nearly
level
plateau
of
the
furggengletscher
making
a
straight
track
to
the
h√∂rnli
from
whence
we
descended
to
zermatt
by
one
of
the
paths
this
pass
has
been
dubbed
the
breuiljoch
by
the
swiss
surveyors
it
is
a
few
feet
higher
than
the
th√©odule
and
it
may
be
recommended
to
those
who
are
familiar
with
that
pass
as
it
gives
equally
fine
views
and
is
accessible
at
all
times
but
it
will
never
be
frequented
like
the
th√©odule
as
the
at
its
summit
at
certain
times
will
require
the
use
of
the
axe
it
took
us
six
hours
and
a
quarter
to
go
from
one
place
to
the
other
which
was
an
hour
longer
than
we
would
have
occupied
by
the
th√©odule
although
the
distance
in
miles
is
less
it
is
stated
in
one
of
the
of
the
late
principal
forbes
that
this
depression
now
called
the
breuiljoch
was
formerly
pass
between
the
val
tournanche
and
zermatt
and
that
it
was
abandoned
for
the
th√©odule
in
consequence
of
changes
in
the
glaciers
the
authority
for
the
statement
was
not
given
i
presume
it
was
from
local
tradition
but
i
readily
credit
it
for
before
the
time
that
the
glaciers
had
shrunk
to
so
great
an
extent
the
steep
above
mentioned
in
all
probability
did
not
exist
and
most
likely
the
glaciers
led
by
very
gentle
gradients
up
to
the
summit
in
which
case
the
route
would
have
formed
the
natural
highway
between
the
two
places
it
is
far
from
impossible
if
the
glaciers
continue
to
diminish
at
their
present
rapid
rate
that
the
th√©odule
itself
the
easiest
and
the
most
frequented
of
all
the
higher
alpine
passes
may
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
become
somewhat
difficult
and
if
this
should
be
the
case
the
prosperity
of
zermatt
will
probably
suffer
carrel
and
i
wandered
out
again
in
the
afternoon
and
went
first
of
all
to
a
favourite
spot
with
tourists
near
the
end
of
the
gorner
glacier
or
properly
speaking
the
boden
glacier
to
a
little
verdant
with
delight
of

of

down
the

through
a
gorge
with
precipitous
sides
not
easily
approached
for
the
turf
at
the
top
was
slippery
and
the
rocks
had
everywhere
been
rounded
by
the
glacier
formerly
extended
far
away
this
gorge
seems
to
have
been
made
chiefly
by
the
torrent
and
to
have
been
excavated
subsequently
to
the
retreat
of
the
glacier
it
seems
so
because
not
merely
upon
its
walls
are
there
the
marks
of
running
water
but
even
upon
the
rounded
rocks
at
the
top
of
its
walls
at
a
height
of
seventy
or
eighty
feet
above
the
present
level
of

are

queer
concavities

from
it

perceives

fashioned
in
the

to
those
to
which

the

the

the
greater
are
the
opportunities
for
the
assaults
of
heat
and
cold
when
water
is
in
the
form
of
glacier
it
has
not
the
power
of
making
concavities
such
as
these
in
rocks
and
of
working
upon
surfaces
which
are
not
opposed
to
the
direction
of
the
current
its
nature
is
changed
it
operates
in
a
different
way
and
it
leaves
marks
which
are
readily
distinguished
from
those
produced
by
the
prevailing
forms
which
result
from
are
more
or
less
ultimately
all
angles
and
almost
all
curves
are
obliterated
and
large
areas
of
flat
surfaces
are
produced
this
perfection
of
abrasion
is
rarely
found
except
in
such
localities
as
have
sustained
a
grinding
much
more
severe
than
that
which
has
occurred
in
the
alps
and
generally
speaking
the
dictum
of
the
veteran
geologist
studer
quoted
below
is
undoubtedly
true
not
merely
can
the
operations
of
extinct
glaciers
be
traced
in
detail
by
means
of
the
bosses
of
rock
popularly
termed
but
their
effects
in
the
aggregate
on
a
range
of
mountains
or
an
entire
country
can
be
recognised
sometimes
at
a
distance
of
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
from
the
incessant
repetition
of
these
convex
forms
we
finished
up
the
of
august
with
a
walk
over
the
findelen
glacier
and
returned
to
zermatt
at
a
later
hour
than
we
intended
both
very
sleepy
this
is
noteworthy
only
on
account
of
that
which
followed
we
had
to
cross
the
col
de
valpelline
on
the
next
day
and
an
early
start
was
desirable
monsieur
seiler
excellent
man
knowing
this
called
us
himself
and
when
he
came
to
my
door
i
answered
all
right
seiler
i
will
get
up
and
immediately
turned
over
to
the
other
side
saying
to
myself
first
of
all
ten
minutes
more
but
seiler
waited
and
listened
and
suspecting
the
case
knocked
again
herr
whymper
have
you
got
a
light
without
thinking
what
the
consequences
might
be
i
answered
no
and
then
the
worthy
man
actually
forced
the
lock
off
his
own
door
to
give
me
one
by
similar
and
equally
friendly
and
disinterested
acts
monsieur
seiler
has
acquired
his
enviable
reputation
at
we
left
his
monte
rosa
hotel
and
were
soon
pushing
our
way
through
the
thickets
of
grey
alder
that
skirt
the
path
up
the
right
bank
of
the
exquisite
little
valley
which
leads
to
the
z
muttgletscher
nothing
can
well
seem
more
inaccessible
than
the
matterhorn
upon
this
side
and
even
in
cold
blood
one
holds
the
breath
when
looking
at
its
stupendous
cliffs
there
are
but
few
equal
to
them
in
size
in
the
alps
and
there
are
none
which
can
more
truly
be
termed
greatest
of
them
all
is
the
immense
north
cliff
which
bends
over
towards
the
z
muttgletscher
stones
which
drop
from
the
top
of
that
amazing
wall
fall
for
about
feet
before
they
touch
anything
and
those
which
roll
down
from
above
and
bound
over
it
fall
to
a
much
greater
depth
and
leap
feet
beyond
its
base
this
side
of
the
mountain
has
always
seemed
it
is
painfully
suggestive
of
decay
ruin
and
death
and
it
is
now
alas
more
than
terrible
by
its
associations
there
is
no
aspect
of
destruction
about
the
matterhorn
cliffs
says
professor
ruskin
granted
they
are
seen
from
afar
but
approach
and
sit
down
by
the
side
of
the
z
muttgletscher
and
you
will
hear
that
their
piecemeal
destruction
is
proceeding
you
will
but
probably
you
will
not
for
even
when
the
descending
masses
thunder
as
loudly
as
heavy
guns
and
the
echoes
roll
back
from
the
ebihorn
opposite
they
will
still
be
as
against
this
grand
old
face
so
vast
is
its
scale
if
you
would
see
the
aspects
of
destruction
you
must
come
still
closer
and
climb
its
cliffs
and
ridges
or
mount
to
the
plateau
of
the
matterhorngletscher
which
is
cut
up
and
ploughed
up
by
these
missiles
and
strewn
on
its
surface
with
their
smaller
fragments
the
larger
masses
falling
with
tremendous
velocity
plunge
into
the
snow
and
are
lost
to
sight
the
matterhorngletscher
too
sends
down
avalanches
as
if
in
rivalry
with
the
rocks
behind
round
the
whole
of
its
northern
side
it
does
not
terminate
in
the
usual
manner
by
gentle
slopes
but
comes
to
a
sudden
end
at
the
top
of
the
steep
rocks
which
lie
betwixt
it
and
the
z
muttgletscher
and
seldom
does
an
hour
pass
without
a
huge
slice
breaking
away
and
falling
with
dreadful
uproar
on
to
the
slopes
below
where
it
is
the
desolate
outside
pines
of
the
z
mutt
forests
stripped
of
their
bark
and
blanched
by
the
weather
are
a
fit
foreground
to
a
scene
that
can
hardly
be
surpassed
in
solemn
grandeur
it
is
a
subject
worthy
of
the
pencil
of
a
great
painter
and
one
which
would
tax
the
powers
of
the
very
greatest
higher
up
the
glacier
the
mountain
appeared
less
savage
although
not
less
inaccessible
and
about
three
hours
later
when
we
arrived
at
the
island
of
rock
called
the
stockje
which
marks
the
end
of
the
z
muttgletscher
proper
and
which
separates
its
higher
feeder
the
stockgletscher
from
its
lower
and
greater
one
the
tiefenmatten
carrel
himself
one
of
the
least
demonstrative
of
men
could
not
refrain
from
expressing
wonder
at
the
steepness
of
its
faces
and
at
the
audacity
that
had
prompted
us
to
camp
upon
the
ridge
the
profile
of
which
is
seen
very
well
from
the
stockje
carrel
then
saw
the
north
and
sides
of
the
mountain
for
the
first
time
and
was
more
firmly
persuaded
than
ever
that
an
ascent
was
possible
from
the
direction
of
breil
three
years
afterwards
i
was
traversing
the
same
spot
with
the
guide
franz
biener
when
all
at
once
a
puff
of
wind
brought
to
us
a
very
bad
smell
and
on
looking
about
we
discovered
a
dead
chamois
up
the
southern
cliffs
of
the
stockje
we
clambered
up
and
found
that
it
had
been
killed
by
a
most
uncommon
and
extraordinary
accident
it
had
slipped
on
the
upper
rocks
had
rolled
over
and
over
down
a
slope
of
d√©bris
without
being
able
to
regain
its
feet
had
fallen
over
a
little
patch
of
rocks
that
projected
through
the
d√©bris
and
had
caught
the
points
of
both
horns
on
a
tiny
ledge
not
an
inch
broad
it
had
just
been
able
to
touch
the
d√©bris
where
it
led
away
down
from
the
rocks
and
had
pawed
and
scratched
until
it
could
no
longer
touch
it
had
evidently
been
starved
to
death
and
we
found
the
poor
beast
almost
swinging
in
the
air
with
its
head
thrown
back
and
tongue
protruding
looking
to
the
sky
as
if
imploring
help
we
had
no
such
excitement
as
this
in
and
crossed
this
easy
pass
to
the
ch√¢lets
of
prerayen
in
a
very
leisurely
fashion
from
the
summit
to
prerayen
let
us
descend
in
one
step
the
way
has
been
described
before
and
those
who
wish
for
information
about
it
should
consult
the
description
of
jacomb
the
discoverer
of
the
pass
nor
need
we
stop
at
prerayen
except
to
remark
that
the
owner
of
the
ch√¢lets
who
is
usually
taken
for
a
common
herdsman
must
not
be
judged
by
appearances
he
is
a
man
of
substance
he
has
many
flocks
and
herds
and
although
when
approached
politely
is
courteous
he
can
and
probably
will
act
as
the
of
prerayen
if
his
position
is
recognised
and
with
all
the
importance
of
a
man
who
pays
taxes
to
the
extent
of
francs
per
annum
to
his
government
illustration
chamois
in
difficulties
the
were
clouded
when
we
rose
from
our
hay
on
the
of
august
we
decided
not
to
continue
the
tour
of
our
mountain
immediately
and
returned
over
our
track
of
the
preceding
day
to
the
highest
ch√¢let
on
the
left
bank
of
the
valley
with
the
intention
of
attacking
the
dent
d
erin
on
the
next
morning
we
were
interested
in
this
summit
more
on
account
of
the
excellent
view
which
it
commanded
of
the
ridge
and
the
terminal
peak
of
the
matterhorn
than
from
any
other
reason
the
dent
d
erin
had
not
been
ascended
at
this
time
and
we
had
diverged
from
our
route
on
the
and
had
scrambled
some
distance
up
the
base
of
mont
brul√©
to
see
how
far
its
slopes
were
assailable
we
were
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
best
way
of
approaching
the
peak
carrel
true
to
his
habit
of
sticking
to
rocks
in
preference
to
ice
counselled
ascending
by
the
long
buttress
of
the
t√™te
de
bella
cia
which
descends
towards
the
west
and
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
last
glacier
that
falls
into
the
glacier
de
zardesan
and
thence
traversing
the
heads
of
all
the
tributaries
of
the
zardesan
to
the
western
and
rocky
ridge
of
the
dent
i
on
the
other
hand
proposed
to
follow
the
glacier
de
zardesan
itself
throughout
its
entire
length
and
from
the
plateau
at
its
head
where
my
proposed
route
would
cross
carrel
s
to
make
directly
towards
the
summit
up
the
glacier
slope
instead
of
by
the
western
ridge
the
hunchback
who
was
accompanying
us
on
these
excursions
declared
in
favour
of
carrel
s
route
and
it
was
accordingly
adopted
the
first
part
of
the
programme
was
successfully
executed
and
at
on
the
of
august
we
were
sitting
astride
the
western
ridge
at
a
height
of
about
feet
looking
down
upon
the
tiefenmatten
glacier
to
all
appearance
another
hour
would
place
us
on
the
summit
but
in
another
hour
we
found
that
we
were
not
destined
to
succeed
the
ridge
like
all
of
the
principal
rocky
ridges
of
the
great
peaks
upon
which
i
have
stood
had
been
completely
shattered
by
frost
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
heap
of
piled
up
fragments
it
was
always
narrow
and
where
it
was
narrowest
it
was
also
the
most
unstable
and
the
most
difficult
on
neither
side
could
we
ascend
it
by
keeping
a
little
below
its
crest
the
side
of
the
tiefenmatten
because
it
was
too
steep
and
on
both
sides
because
the
dislodgment
of
a
single
block
would
have
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
all
those
which
were
above
forced
therefore
to
keep
to
the
very
crest
of
the
ridge
and
unable
to
deviate
a
single
step
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
we
were
compelled
to
trust
ourselves
upon
unsteady
masses
which
trembled
under
our
tread
which
sometimes
settled
down
grating
in
a
hollow
and
ominous
manner
and
which
seemed
as
if
a
little
shake
would
send
the
whole
roaring
down
in
one
awful
avalanche
i
followed
my
leader
who
said
not
a
word
and
did
not
rebel
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
a
block
had
to
be
surmounted
which
lay
poised
across
the
ridge
carrel
could
not
climb
it
without
assistance
or
advance
beyond
it
until
i
joined
him
above
and
as
he
stepped
off
my
back
on
to
it
i
felt
it
quiver
and
bear
down
upon
me
i
doubted
the
possibility
of
another
man
standing
upon
it
without
bringing
it
down
then
i
rebelled
there
was
no
honour
to
be
gained
by
persevering
or
dishonour
in
turning
from
a
place
which
was
dangerous
on
account
of
its
excessive
difficulty
so
we
returned
to
prerayen
for
there
was
too
little
time
to
allow
us
to
by
the
other
route
which
was
subsequently
shown
to
be
the
right
way
up
the
mountain
four
days
afterwards
a
party
of
englishmen
including
my
friends
hall
craufurd
grove
and
reginald
macdonald
arrived
in
the
valpelline
and
unaware
of
our
attempt
on
the
under
the
skilful
guidance
of
melchior
anderegg
made
the
first
ascent
of
the
dent
d
erin
by
the
route
which
i
had
proposed
this
is
the
only
mountain
which
i
have
essayed
to
ascend
that
has
not
sooner
or
later
fallen
to
me
our
failure
was
mortifying
yet
i
am
satisfied
that
we
did
wisely
in
returning
and
that
if
we
had
persevered
by
carrel
s
route
another
alpine
accident
would
have
been
recorded
other
routes
have
been
since
discovered
up
the
dent
d
erin
the
ascent
ranks
amongst
the
more
difficult
ones
which
have
been
made
in
the
alps
on
the
of
august
we
crossed
the
va
corn√®re
pass
and
had
a
good
look
at
the
mountain
named
the
grand
tournalin
as
we
descended
the
val
de
chignana
this
mountain
was
seen
from
so
many
points
and
was
so
much
higher
than
any
peak
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
that
it
was
bound
to
give
a
very
fine
view
and
as
the
weather
continued
unfavourable
for
the
matterhorn
i
arranged
with
carrel
to
ascend
it
the
next
day
and
despatched
him
direct
to
the
village
of
val
tournanche
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
whilst
i
with
meynet
made
a
short
cut
to
breil
at
the
back
of
mont
panquero
by
a
little
pass
locally
known
as
the
col
de
fen√™tre
i
rejoined
carrel
the
same
evening
at
val
tournanche
and
we
started
from
that
place
at
a
little
before
on
the
to
attack
the
tournalin
meynet
was
left
behind
for
that
day
and
most
unwillingly
did
the
hunchback
part
from
us
and
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
come
pay
me
nothing
only
let
me
go
with
you
i
shall
want
but
a
little
bread
and
cheese
and
of
that
i
won
t
eat
much
i
would
much
rather
go
with
you
than
carry
things
down
the
such
were
his
arguments
and
i
was
really
sorry
that
the
rapidity
of
our
movements
obliged
us
to
desert
the
good
little
man
carrel
led
over
the
meadows
on
the
south
and
east
of
the
bluff
upon
which
the
village
of
val
tournanche
is
built
and
then
by
a
path
through
a
long
and
steep
forest
making
many
short
cuts
which
showed
he
had
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
ground
after
we
came
again
into
daylight
our
route
took
us
up
one
of
those
little
concealed
lateral
valleys
which
are
so
numerous
on
the
slopes
bounding
the
val
tournanche
this
valley
the
combe
de
ceneil
has
a
general
easterly
trend
and
contains
but
one
small
cluster
of
houses
ceneil
the
tournalin
is
situated
at
the
head
of
the
combe
and
nearly
due
east
of
the
village
of
val
tournanche
but
from
that
place
no
part
of
the
mountain
is
visible
after
ceneil
is
passed
it
comes
into
view
rising
above
a
cirque
of
cliffs
streaked
by
several
fine
waterfalls
at
the
end
of
the
combe
to
avoid
these
cliffs
the
path
bends
somewhat
to
the
south
keeping
throughout
to
the
left
bank
of
the
valley
and
at
about
feet
above
val
tournanche
and
feet
above
ceneil
and
a
mile
or
so
to
its
east
arrives
at
the
base
of
some
moraines
which
are
remarkably
large
considering
the
dimensions
of
the
glaciers
which
formed
them
the
ranges
upon
the
western
side
of
the
val
tournanche
are
seen
to
great
advantage
from
this
spot
and
here
the
path
ends
and
the
way
steepens
when
we
arrived
at
these
moraines
we
had
a
choice
of
two
routes
one
continuing
to
the
east
over
the
moraines
themselves
the
d√©bris
above
them
and
a
large
still
higher
up
to
a
kind
of
or
depression
to
the
of
the
peak
from
whence
an
easy
ridge
led
towards
the
summit
the
other
over
a
shrunken
glacier
on
our
now
perhaps
not
in
existence
which
led
to
a
on
the
of
the
peak
from
whence
a
less
easy
ridge
rose
directly
to
the
highest
point
we
followed
the
first
named
of
these
routes
and
in
little
more
than
stood
upon
the
col
which
commanded
a
most
glorious
view
of
the
southern
side
of
monte
rosa
and
of
the
ranges
to
its
east
and
to
the
east
of
the
val
d
ayas
illustration
they
scattered
in
a
panic
when
saluted
by
the
cries
of
my
excited
whilst
we
were
resting
at
this
point
a
large
party
of
vagrant
chamois
arrived
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
from
the
northern
side
some
of
their
statuesque
to
appreciate
the
grand
panorama
by
which
they
were
surrounded
while
others
amused
themselves
like
tourists
in
rolling
stones
over
the
cliffs
the
clatter
of
these
falling
fragments
made
us
look
up
the
chamois
were
so
numerous
that
we
could
not
count
them
and
clustered
around
the
summit
totally
unaware
of
our
presence
they
scattered
in
a
panic
as
if
a
shell
had
burst
amongst
them
when
saluted
by
the
cries
of
my
excited
comrade
and
plunged
wildly
down
in
several
directions
with
unfaltering
and
unerring
bounds
with
such
speed
and
with
such
grace
that
we
were
filled
with
admiration
and
respect
for
their
mountaineering
abilities
the
ridge
that
led
from
the
col
towards
the
summit
was
singularly
easy
although
well
broken
up
by
frost
and
carrel
thought
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
arrange
a
path
for
mules
out
of
the
shattered
blocks
but
when
we
arrived
on
the
summit
we
found
ourselves
separated
from
the
very
highest
point
by
a
cleft
which
had
been
concealed
up
to
that
time
its
southern
side
was
nearly
perpendicular
but
it
was
only
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
deep
carrel
lowered
me
down
and
afterwards
descended
on
to
the
head
of
my
axe
and
subsequently
on
to
my
shoulders
with
a
cleverness
which
was
almost
as
far
removed
from
my
awkwardness
as
his
own
efforts
were
from
those
of
the
chamois
a
few
easy
steps
then
placed
us
on
the
highest
point
it
had
not
been
ascended
before
and
we
commemorated
the
event
by
building
a
huge
cairn
which
was
seen
for
many
a
mile
and
would
have
lasted
for
many
a
year
had
it
not
been
thrown
down
by
the
orders
of
canon
carrel
on
account
of
its
interrupting
the
sweep
of
a
camera
which
he
took
to
the
lower
summit
in
in
order
to
photograph
the
panorama
according
to
that
mountaineer
the
summit
of
the
grand
tournalin
is
feet
above
the
village
of
val
tournanche
and
feet
above
the
sea
its
ascent
including
halts
occupied
us
only
four
hours
illustration
carrel
lowered
me
i
recommend
any
person
who
has
a
day
to
spare
in
the
val
tournanche
to
ascend
the
tournalin
it
should
be
remembered
however
if
its
ascent
is
made
for
the
sake
of
the
view
that
these
southern
pennine
alps
seldom
remain
unclouded
after
and
indeed
frequently
not
later
than
or
towards
sunset
the
equilibrium
of
the
atmosphere
is
restored
and
the
clouds
very
commonly
disappear
i
advise
the
ascent
of
this
mountain
not
on
account
of
its
height
or
from
its
accessibility
or
inaccessibility
but
simply
for
the
wide
and
splendid
view
which
may
be
seen
from
its
summit
its
position
is
superb
and
the
list
of
the
peaks
which
can
be
seen
from
it
includes
almost
the
whole
of
the
principal
mountains
of
the
cottian
dauphin√©
graian
pennine
and
oberland
groups
the
view
has
in
the
highest
perfection
those
elements
of
picturesqueness
which
are
wanting
in
the
purely
panoramic
views
of
higher
summits
there
are
three
principal
sections
each
with
a
central
or
dominating
point
to
which
the
eye
is
naturally
drawn
all
three
alike
are
pictures
in
themselves
yet
all
are
dissimilar
in
the
south
softened
by
the
vapours
of
the
val
d
aoste
extends
the
long
line
of
the
graians
with
mountain
after
mountain
feet
and
upwards
in
height
it
is
not
upon
these
noble
as
some
of
them
are
that
the
eye
will
rest
but
upon
the
viso
far
off
in
the
background
in
the
west
and
towards
the
north
the
range
of
mont
blanc
and
some
of
the
greatest
of
the
central
pennine
alps
including
the
grand
combin
and
the
dent
blanche
form
the
background
but
they
are
overpowered
by
the
grandeur
of
the
ridges
which
culminate
in
the
matterhorn
nor
in
the
east
and
north
where
pleasant
grassy
slopes
lead
downwards
to
the
val
d
ayas
nor
upon
the
glaciers
and
above
them
nor
upon
the
oberland
in
the
background
will
the
eye
long
linger
when
immediately
in
front
several
miles
away
but
seeming
close
at
hand
thrown
out
by
the
pure
azure
sky
there
are
the
glittering
crests
of
monte
rosa
illustration
the
late
canon
carrel
of
aosta
those
who
would
but
can
not
stand
upon
the
highest
alps
may
console
themselves
with
the
knowledge
that
they
do
not
usually
yield
the
views
that
make
the
strongest
and
most
permanent
impressions
marvellous
some
of
the
panoramas
seen
from
the
greatest
peaks
undoubtedly
are
but
they
are
necessarily
without
those
isolated
and
central
points
which
are
so
valuable
pictorially
the
eye
roams
over
a
multitude
of
objects
each
perhaps
grand
individually
and
distracted
by
an
embarrassment
of
riches
wanders
from
one
to
another
erasing
by
the
contemplation
of
the
next
the
effect
that
was
produced
by
the
last
and
when
those
happy
moments
are
over
which
always
fly
with
too
great
rapidity
the
summit
is
left
with
an
impression
that
is
seldom
durable
because
it
is
usually
vague
no
views
create
such
lasting
impressions
as
those
which
are
seen
but
for
a
moment
when
a
veil
of
mist
is
rent
in
twain
and
a
single
spire
or
dome
is
disclosed
the
peaks
which
are
seen
at
these
moments
are
not
perhaps
the
greatest
or
the
noblest
but
the
recollection
of
them
outlives
the
memory
of
any
panoramic
view
because
the
picture
photographed
by
the
eye
has
time
to
dry
instead
of
being
blurred
while
yet
wet
by
contact
with
other
impressions
the
reverse
is
the
case
with
the
bird
panoramic
views
from
the
great
peaks
which
sometimes
embrace
a
hundred
miles
in
nearly
every
direction
the
eye
is
confounded
by
the
crowd
of
details
and
is
unable
to
distinguish
the
relative
importance
of
the
objects
which
are
seen
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
form
a
just
estimate
with
the
eye
of
the
respective
heights
of
a
number
of
peaks
from
a
very
high
summit
as
it
is
from
the
bottom
of
a
valley
i
think
that
the
grandest
and
the
most
satisfactory
standpoints
for
viewing
mountain
scenery
are
those
which
are
sufficiently
elevated
to
give
a
feeling
of
depth
as
well
as
of
height
which
are
lofty
enough
to
exhibit
wide
and
varied
views
but
not
so
high
as
to
sink
everything
to
the
level
of
the
spectator
the
view
from
the
grand
tournalin
is
a
favourable
example
of
this
class
of
panoramic
views
we
descended
from
the
summit
by
the
northern
route
and
found
it
tolerably
stiff
clambering
as
far
as
the
thence
down
the
glacier
the
way
was
straightforward
and
we
joined
the
route
taken
on
the
ascent
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
leading
towards
the
east
in
the
evening
we
returned
to
breil
there
is
an
abrupt
rise
in
the
valley
about
two
miles
to
the
north
of
the
village
of
val
tournanche
and
just
above
this
step
the
torrent
has
eaten
its
way
into
its
bed
and
formed
an
extraordinary
chasm
which
has
long
been
known
by
the
name
gouffre
des
busserailles
we
lingered
about
this
spot
to
listen
to
the
thunder
of
the
concealed
water
and
to
watch
its
tumultuous
boiling
as
it
issued
from
the
gloomy
cleft
but
our
efforts
to
peer
into
the
mysteries
of
the
place
were
baffled
in
november
the
intrepid
carrel
induced
two
trusty
maquignaz
s
of
val
lower
him
by
a
rope
into
the
chasm
and
over
the
cataract
the
feat
required
iron
nerves
and
muscles
and
sinews
of
no
ordinary
kind
and
its
performance
alone
stamps
carrel
as
a
man
of
dauntless
courage
one
of
the
maquignaz
s
subsequently
descended
in
the
same
way
and
these
two
men
were
so
astonished
at
what
they
saw
that
they
forthwith
set
to
work
with
hammer
and
chisel
to
make
a
way
into
this
romantic
gulf
in
a
few
days
they
constructed
a
rough
but
convenient
plank
gallery
into
the
centre
of
the
along
its
walls
and
on
payment
of
a
toll
of
half
a
franc
any
one
can
now
enter
the
gouffre
des
busserailles
i
can
not
without
a
couple
of
sections
and
a
plan
give
an
exact
idea
to
the
reader
of
this
remarkable
place
it
corresponds
in
some
of
its
features
to
the
gorge
figured
upon
page
but
it
exhibits
in
a
much
more
notable
manner
the
characteristic
action
and
extraordinary
power
of
running
water
the
length
of
the
chasm
or
is
about
feet
and
from
the
top
of
its
walls
to
the
surface
of
the
water
is
about
feet
at
no
part
can
the
entire
length
or
depth
be
seen
at
a
glance
for
although
the
width
at
some
places
is
feet
or
more
the
view
is
limited
by
the
sinuosities
of
the
walls
these
are
everywhere
polished
to
a
smooth
surface
in
some
places
the
torrent
has
wormed
into
the
rock
and
has
left
natural
bridges
the
most
extraordinary
features
of
the
gouffre
des
busserailles
however
are
the
caverns
or
as
they
are
termed
which
the
water
has
hollowed
out
of
the
heart
of
the
rock
carrel
s
plank
path
leads
into
one
of
the
greatest
grotto
that
is
about
feet
across
at
its
largest
diameter
and
or
feet
high
roofed
above
by
the
living
rock
and
with
the
torrent
roaring
feet
or
thereabouts
below
at
the
bottom
of
a
fissure
this
cavern
is
lighted
by
candles
and
talking
in
it
can
only
be
managed
by
signs
i
visited
the
interior
of
the
in
and
my
wonder
at
its
caverns
was
increased
by
observing
the
hardness
of
the
hornblende
out
of
which
they
have
been
hollowed
carrel
chiselled
off
a
large
piece
which
is
now
lying
before
me
it
has
a
highly
polished
glassy
surface
and
might
be
mistaken
for
a
moment
for
rock
but
the
water
has
found
out
the
atoms
which
were
least
hard
and
it
is
dotted
all
over
by
minute
depressions
much
as
the
face
of
one
is
who
has
suffered
from
smallpox
the
edges
of
these
little
hollows
are
and
the
whole
surfaces
of
the
depressions
are
polished
nearly
or
quite
as
highly
as
the
general
surface
of
the
fragment
the
water
has
eaten
more
deeply
into
some
veins
of
steatite
than
in
other
places
and
the
presence
of
the
steatite
may
possibly
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
formation
of
the
i
arrived
at
breil
again
after
an
absence
of
six
days
well
satisfied
with
my
tour
of
the
matterhorn
which
had
been
rendered
very
pleasant
by
the
willingness
of
my
guides
and
by
the
kindliness
of
the
natives
still
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
val
tournanche
are
behind
the
times
their
paths
are
as
bad
as
or
worse
than
they
were
in
the
time
of
de
saussure
and
their
inns
are
much
inferior
to
those
on
the
swiss
side
if
it
were
otherwise
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
valley
becoming
one
of
the
most
popular
and
frequented
of
all
the
valleys
in
the
alps
as
it
is
tourists
who
enter
it
seem
to
think
only
about
how
soon
they
can
get
out
of
it
and
hence
it
is
much
less
known
than
it
deserves
to
be
on
account
of
its
natural
attractions
i
believe
that
the
great
hindrance
to
the
improvement
of
the
paths
in
the
italian
valleys
generally
is
the
impression
that
the
innkeepers
would
alone
directly
benefit
by
any
amelioration
of
their
condition
to
a
certain
extent
this
view
is
correct
but
inasmuch
as
the
prosperity
of
the
natives
is
connected
with
that
of
the
innkeepers
the
interests
of
both
are
pretty
nearly
identical
until
their
paths
are
rendered
less
rough
and
swampy
i
think
the
italians
must
submit
to
see
the
golden
harvest
principally
reaped
in
switzerland
and
savoy
at
the
same
time
let
the
innkeepers
look
to
the
commissariat
their
supplies
are
not
unfrequently
deficient
in
quantity
and
according
to
my
experience
very
often
deplorable
in
quality
i
will
not
venture
to
criticise
in
detail
the
dishes
which
are
brought
to
table
since
i
am
profoundly
ignorant
of
their
constitution
it
is
commonly
said
amongst
alpine
tourists
that
goat
flesh
represents
mutton
and
mule
does
service
for
beef
and
chamois
i
reserve
my
own
opinion
upon
this
point
until
it
has
been
shown
what
becomes
of
all
the
dead
mules
but
i
may
say
i
hope
without
wounding
the
susceptibilities
of
my
acquaintances
among
the
italian
innkeepers
that
it
would
tend
to
smoothen
their
intercourse
with
their
guests
if
requests
for
solid
food
were
less
frequently
regarded
as
criminal
the
deprecating
airs
with
which
inquiries
for
really
substantial
food
are
received
always
remind
me
of
a
dauphin√©
innkeeper
who
remarked
that
he
had
heard
a
good
many
tourists
travel
in
switzerland
yes
i
answered
there
are
a
good
how
many
well
i
said
i
have
seen
a
hundred
or
more
sit
down
at
a
table
d
he
lifted
up
his
why
said
he
they
would
want
meat
every
day
yes
that
is
not
in
that
case
he
replied
think
we
are
better
without
chapter
vi
our
sixth
attempt
to
ascend
the
matterhorn
but
mighty
jove
cuts
short
with
just
disdain
the
long
long
views
of
poor
designing
homer
carrel
had
in
the
matter
of
guides
and
his
choice
fell
upon
his
relative
c√¶sar
luc
meynet
and
two
others
whose
names
i
do
not
know
these
men
were
now
brought
together
and
our
preparations
were
completed
as
the
weather
was
clearing
up
we
rested
on
sunday
august
eagerly
watching
the
lessening
of
the
mists
around
the
great
peak
and
started
just
before
dawn
upon
the
on
a
still
and
cloudless
morning
which
seemed
to
promise
a
happy
termination
to
our
enterprise
by
going
always
though
gently
we
arrived
upon
the
col
du
lion
before
nine
o
clock
changes
were
apparent
familiar
ledges
had
vanished
the
platform
whereupon
my
tent
had
stood
looked
very
forlorn
its
stones
had
been
scattered
by
wind
and
frost
and
had
half
disappeared
and
the
summit
of
the
col
itself
which
in
had
always
been
respectably
broad
and
covered
by
snow
was
now
sharper
than
the
ridge
of
any
church
roof
and
was
hard
ice
already
we
had
found
that
the
bad
weather
of
the
past
week
had
done
its
work
the
rocks
for
several
hundred
feet
below
the
col
were
varnished
with
ice
loose
incoherent
snow
covered
the
older
and
harder
beds
below
and
we
nearly
lost
our
leader
through
its
treacherousness
he
stepped
on
some
snow
which
seemed
firm
and
raised
his
axe
to
deliver
a
swinging
blow
but
just
as
it
was
highest
the
crust
of
the
slope
upon
which
he
stood
broke
away
and
poured
down
in
serpentine
streams
leaving
long
bare
strips
which
glittered
in
the
sun
for
they
were
glassy
ice
carrel
with
admirable
readiness
flung
himself
back
on
to
the
rock
off
which
he
had
stepped
and
was
at
once
secured
he
simply
remarked
it
is
time
we
were
tied
up
and
after
we
had
been
tied
up
he
went
to
work
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
we
had
abundant
illustrations
during
the
next
two
hours
of
the
value
of
a
rope
to
climbers
we
were
tied
up
rather
widely
apart
and
advanced
generally
in
pairs
carrel
who
led
was
followed
closely
by
another
man
who
lent
him
a
shoulder
or
placed
an
under
his
feet
when
there
was
need
and
when
this
couple
were
well
placed
the
second
pair
advanced
in
similar
fashion
rope
being
drawn
in
by
those
above
and
paid
out
gradually
by
those
below
the
leading
men
again
advanced
or
the
third
pair
and
so
on
this
manner
of
progression
was
slow
but
sure
one
man
only
moved
at
a
time
and
if
he
slipped
and
we
frequently
did
slip
he
could
slide
scarcely
a
foot
without
being
checked
by
the
others
the
certainty
and
safety
of
the
method
gave
confidence
to
the
one
who
was
moving
and
not
only
nerved
him
to
put
out
his
powers
to
the
utmost
but
sustained
nerve
in
really
difficult
situations
for
these
rocks
which
it
has
been
already
said
were
easy
enough
under
ordinary
circumstances
were
now
difficult
in
a
high
degree
the
which
had
trickled
down
for
many
days
past
in
little
streams
had
taken
naturally
the
very
route
by
which
we
wished
to
ascend
and
refrozen
in
the
night
had
glazed
the
slabs
over
which
we
had
to
pass
with
a
fine
film
of
ice
as
thin
as
a
sheet
of
paper
and
sometimes
so
thickly
that
we
could
almost
cut
footsteps
in
it
the
weather
was
superb
the
men
made
light
of
the
toil
and
shouted
to
rouse
the
echoes
from
the
dent
d
h√©rens
we
went
on
gaily
passed
the
second
tent
platform
the
chimney
and
the
other
points
and
reckoned
confidently
on
sleeping
that
night
upon
the
top
of
the
shoulder
but
before
we
had
well
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
a
sudden
rush
of
cold
air
warned
us
to
look
out
it
was
difficult
to
say
where
this
air
came
from
it
did
not
blow
as
a
wind
but
descended
rather
as
the
water
in
a
all
was
tranquil
again
the
atmosphere
no
signs
of
disturbance
there
was
a
dead
calm
and
not
a
speck
of
cloud
to
be
seen
anywhere
but
we
did
not
remain
very
long
in
this
state
the
cold
air
came
again
and
this
time
it
was
difficult
to
say
where
it
did
come
from
we
jammed
down
our
hats
as
it
beat
against
the
ridge
and
screamed
amongst
the
crags
before
we
had
got
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
mists
had
been
formed
above
and
below
they
appeared
at
first
in
small
isolated
patches
in
several
places
at
the
same
time
which
danced
and
jerked
and
were
torn
into
shreds
by
the
wind
but
grew
larger
under
the
process
they
were
united
together
and
rent
again
us
the
blue
sky
for
a
moment
and
blotting
it
out
the
next
and
augmented
incessantly
until
the
whole
heavens
were
filled
with
whirling
boiling
clouds
before
we
could
take
off
our
packs
and
get
under
any
kind
of
shelter
a
hurricane
of
snow
burst
upon
us
from
the
east
it
fell
very
heavily
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
ridge
was
covered
by
it
what
shall
we
do
i
shouted
to
carrel
monsieur
said
he
the
wind
is
bad
the
weather
has
changed
we
are
heavily
laden
here
is
a
fine
let
us
stop
if
we
go
on
we
shall
be
that
is
no
one
differed
from
him
so
we
fell
to
work
to
make
a
place
for
the
tent
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
completed
the
platform
which
we
had
commenced
in
the
clouds
had
blackened
during
that
time
and
we
had
hardly
finished
our
task
before
a
thunderstorm
broke
upon
us
with
appalling
fury
forked
lightning
shot
out
at
the
turrets
above
and
at
the
crags
below
it
was
so
close
that
we
quailed
at
its
darts
it
seemed
to
scorch
us
were
in
the
very
focus
of
the
storm
the
thunder
was
simultaneous
with
the
flashes
short
and
sharp
and
more
like
the
noise
of
a
door
that
is
violently
slammed
multiplied
a
thousandfold
than
any
noise
to
which
i
can
compare
it
when
i
say
that
the
thunder
was
with
the
lightning
i
speak
as
an
inexact
person
my
meaning
is
that
the
time
which
elapsed
between
seeing
the
flash
and
hearing
the
report
was
inappreciable
to
me
i
wish
to
speak
with
all
possible
precision
and
there
are
two
points
with
regard
to
this
storm
upon
which
i
can
speak
with
some
accuracy
the
first
is
in
regard
to
the
distance
of
the
lightning
from
our
party
we
have
been
feet
from
it
if
a
second
of
time
had
elapsed
between
seeing
the
flashes
and
hearing
the
reports
and
a
second
of
time
is
not
appreciated
by
inexact
persons
it
was
certain
that
we
were
sometimes
less
than
that
distance
from
the
lightning
because
i
saw
it
pass
in
front
of
points
on
the
ridge
both
above
and
below
us
which
were
less
sometimes
considerably
less
than
a
thousand
feet
distant
secondly
in
regard
to
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
sounds
which
are
merely
echoes
from
true
thunder
or
the
noise
which
occurs
simultaneously
with
lightning
arago
entered
into
this
subject
at
some
length
in
his
and
seemed
to
doubt
if
it
would
ever
be
possible
to
determine
whether
echoes
are
the
cause
of
the
rolling
sounds
commonly
called
thunder
i
shall
not
attempt
to
show
whether
the
rolling
sounds
should
ever
or
never
be
regarded
as
true
thunder
but
only
that
during
this
storm
upon
the
matterhorn
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
the
sound
of
the
thunder
itself
from
the
sounds
rolling
and
otherwise
which
were
merely
the
echoes
of
the
first
original
sound
at
the
place
where
we
were
camped
a
remarkable
echo
could
be
heard
one
so
remarkable
that
if
it
could
be
heard
in
this
country
it
would
draw
crowds
for
its
own
sake
i
believe
it
came
from
the
cliffs
of
the
dent
d
h√©rens
it
was
a
favourite
amusement
with
us
to
shout
to
rouse
this
echo
which
repeated
any
sharp
cry
in
a
very
distinct
manner
several
times
after
the
lapse
of
something
like
a
dozen
seconds
the
thunderstorm
lasted
nearly
two
hours
and
raged
at
times
with
great
fury
and
the
prolonged
rollings
from
the
surrounding
mountains
after
one
flash
had
not
usually
ceased
before
another
set
of
echoes
took
up
the
discourse
and
maintained
the
reverberations
without
a
break
occasionally
there
was
a
pause
interrupted
presently
by
a
single
clap
the
accompaniment
of
a
single
discharge
and
after
such
times
i
could
recognise
the
echoes
from
the
dent
d
h√©rens
by
their
peculiar
repetitions
and
by
the
length
of
time
which
had
passed
since
the
reports
had
occurred
of
which
they
were
the
echoes
if
i
had
been
unaware
of
the
existence
of
this
echo
i
should
have
supposed
that
the
resounds
were
original
reports
of
explosions
which
had
been
unnoticed
since
in
intensity
they
were
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
true
thunder
which
during
this
storm
seemed
to
me
upon
every
occasion
to
consist
of
a
single
harsh
instantaneous
sound
or
if
instead
of
being
placed
at
a
distance
of
less
than
a
thousand
feet
from
the
points
of
explosion
and
consequently
hearing
the
report
almost
in
the
same
moment
as
we
saw
the
flash
and
the
rollings
after
a
considerable
interval
of
time
we
had
been
placed
so
that
the
original
report
had
fallen
on
our
ears
nearly
at
the
same
moment
as
the
echoes
we
should
probably
have
considered
that
the
successive
reports
and
rollings
of
the
echoes
were
reports
of
successive
explosions
occurring
nearly
at
the
same
moment
and
that
they
were
not
echoes
at
all
this
is
the
only
time
out
of
many
storms
witnessed
in
the
alps
i
have
obtained
evidence
that
the
rollings
of
thunder
are
actually
echoes
and
that
they
are
not
necessarily
the
reports
of
a
number
of
discharges
over
a
long
line
occurring
at
varying
distances
from
the
spectator
and
consequently
unable
to
arrive
at
his
ear
at
the
same
moment
although
they
follow
each
other
so
swiftly
as
to
produce
a
sound
more
or
less
continuous
the
wind
during
all
this
time
seemed
to
blow
tolerably
consistently
from
the
east
it
smote
the
tent
so
vehemently
notwithstanding
it
was
partly
protected
by
rocks
that
we
had
grave
fears
our
refuge
might
be
blown
away
bodily
with
ourselves
inside
so
during
some
of
the
lulls
we
issued
out
and
built
a
wall
to
windward
at
three
the
wind
changed
to
the
and
the
clouds
vanished
we
immediately
took
the
opportunity
to
send
down
one
of
the
porters
under
protection
of
some
of
the
others
a
little
beyond
the
col
du
lion
as
the
tent
would
accommodate
only
five
persons
from
this
time
to
sunset
the
weather
was
variable
it
was
sometimes
blowing
and
snowing
hard
and
sometimes
a
dead
calm
the
bad
weather
was
evidently
confined
to
the
mont
cervin
for
when
the
clouds
lifted
we
could
see
everything
that
could
be
seen
from
our
g√Æte
monte
viso
a
hundred
miles
off
was
clear
and
the
sun
set
gorgeously
behind
the
range
of
mont
blanc
we
passed
the
night
our
but
there
was
little
chance
of
sleeping
between
the
noise
of
the
wind
of
the
thunder
and
of
the
falling
rocks
i
forgave
the
thunder
for
the
sake
of
the
lightning
a
more
splendid
spectacle
than
its
illumination
of
the
matterhorn
crags
i
do
not
expect
to
see
the
greatest
always
seemed
to
occur
in
the
night
between
midnight
and
daybreak
this
was
noticeable
on
each
of
the
seven
nights
which
i
passed
upon
the
ridge
at
heights
varying
from
to
feet
i
may
be
wrong
in
supposing
that
the
falls
in
the
night
are
greater
than
those
in
the
daytime
since
sound
is
much
more
startling
during
darkness
than
when
the
cause
of
its
production
is
seen
even
a
sigh
may
be
terrible
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
in
the
daytime
one
s
attention
is
probably
divided
between
the
sound
and
the
motion
of
rocks
which
fall
or
it
may
be
concentrated
on
other
matters
but
it
is
certain
that
the
greatest
of
the
falls
which
happened
during
the
night
took
place
after
midnight
and
this
i
connect
with
the
fact
that
the
maximum
of
cold
during
any
hours
very
commonly
occurs
between
midnight
and
dawn
we
turned
out
at
on
the
and
were
dismayed
to
find
that
it
still
continued
to
snow
at
it
ceased
to
fall
and
the
sun
showed
itself
feebly
so
we
packed
up
our
baggage
and
set
out
to
try
to
get
upon
the
we
struggled
upwards
until
eleven
o
clock
and
then
it
commenced
to
snow
again
we
held
a
council
the
opinions
expressed
at
it
were
unanimous
against
advancing
and
i
decided
to
retreat
for
we
had
risen
less
than
feet
in
the
past
two
hours
and
had
not
even
arrived
at
the
rope
which
tyndall
s
party
left
behind
attached
to
the
rocks
in
at
the
same
rate
of
progression
it
would
have
taken
us
from
four
to
five
hours
to
get
upon
the
not
one
of
us
cared
to
attempt
to
do
so
under
the
existing
circumstances
for
besides
having
to
move
our
own
weight
which
was
sufficiently
troublesome
at
this
part
of
the
ridge
we
had
to
transport
much
heavy
baggage
tent
blankets
and
provisions
ladder
and
feet
of
rope
besides
many
other
smaller
matters
these
however
were
not
the
most
serious
considerations
supposing
that
we
got
upon
the
shoulder
we
might
find
ourselves
detained
there
several
days
unable
either
to
go
up
or
down
i
could
not
risk
any
such
detention
being
under
obligations
to
appear
in
london
at
the
end
of
the
week
illustration
the
crags
of
the
matterhorn
during
the
storm
midnight
we
returned
to
breil
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
it
was
quite
fine
there
and
the
tenants
of
the
inn
received
our
statements
with
evident
scepticism
they
were
astonished
to
learn
that
we
had
been
exposed
to
a
of
hours
duration
why
said
favre
the
innkeeper
have
had
no
snow
it
has
been
fine
all
the
time
you
have
been
absent
and
there
has
been
only
that
small
cloud
upon
the
ah
that
small
cloud
none
except
those
who
have
had
experience
of
it
can
tell
what
a
formidable
obstacle
it
is
illustration
monsieur
favre
why
is
it
that
the
matterhorn
is
subject
to
these
abominable
variations
of
weather
the
ready
answer
is
oh
the
mountain
is
so
isolated
it
attracts
the
this
is
not
a
sufficient
answer
although
the
mountain
isolated
it
is
not
so
much
more
isolated
than
the
neighbouring
peaks
that
it
should
gather
clouds
when
none
of
the
others
do
so
it
will
not
at
all
account
for
the
cloud
to
which
i
refer
which
is
not
formed
by
an
aggregation
of
smaller
stray
clouds
drawn
together
from
a
distance
as
scum
collects
round
a
log
in
the
water
but
is
created
against
the
mountain
itself
and
springs
into
existence
where
no
clouds
were
seen
before
it
is
formed
and
hangs
chiefly
against
the
southern
sides
and
particularly
against
the
side
it
frequently
does
not
envelop
the
summit
and
rarely
extends
down
to
the
glacier
du
lion
and
to
the
glacier
du
mont
cervin
below
it
forms
in
the
finest
weather
on
cloudless
and
windless
days
i
conceive
that
we
should
look
to
differences
of
temperature
rather
than
to
the
height
or
isolation
of
the
mountain
for
an
explanation
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
the
disturbances
which
occur
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
southern
sides
of
the
matterhorn
on
fine
days
principally
to
the
fact
that
the
mountain
is
a
mountain
that
it
receives
a
great
amount
of
heat
and
is
not
only
warmer
itself
but
is
surrounded
by
an
atmosphere
of
a
higher
temperature
than
such
peaks
as
the
weisshorn
and
the
lyskamm
which
are
eminently
mountains
in
certain
states
of
the
atmosphere
its
temperature
may
be
tolerably
uniform
over
wide
areas
and
to
great
elevations
i
have
known
the
thermometer
to
show
in
the
shade
at
the
top
of
an
alpine
peak
more
than
feet
high
and
but
a
very
few
degrees
higher
or
feet
lower
at
other
times
there
will
be
a
difference
of
forty
or
fifty
degrees
faht
between
two
stations
the
higher
not
more
than
or
feet
above
the
lower
provided
that
the
temperature
was
uniform
or
nearly
so
on
all
sides
of
the
matterhorn
and
to
a
considerable
distance
above
its
summit
no
clouds
would
be
likely
to
form
upon
it
but
if
the
atmosphere
immediately
surrounding
it
is
warmer
than
the
contiguous
strata
a
local
courant
ascendant
must
necessarily
be
generated
and
portions
of
the
cooler
superincumbent
or
circumjacent
air
will
naturally
be
attracted
towards
the
mountain
where
they
will
speedily
condense
the
moisture
of
the
warm
air
in
contact
with
it
i
can
not
explain
the
downrushes
of
cold
air
which
occur
on
it
when
all
the
rest
of
the
neighbourhood
appears
to
be
tranquil
in
any
other
way
the
clouds
are
produced
by
the
contact
of
two
strata
of
air
of
widely
different
temperatures
charged
with
invisible
moisture
as
surely
as
certain
colourless
fluids
produce
a
white
turbid
liquid
when
mixed
together
the
order
has
of
a
low
or
hail
this
opinion
is
borne
out
to
some
extent
by
the
behaviour
of
the
neighbouring
mountains
the
dom
feet
and
the
dent
blanche
have
both
of
them
large
cliffs
of
bare
rock
upon
their
southern
sides
and
against
those
cliffs
clouds
commonly
form
during
fine
still
weather
at
the
same
time
as
the
cloud
on
the
matterhorn
whilst
the
weisshorn
and
the
lyskamm
mountains
of
about
the
same
altitude
and
which
are
in
corresponding
situations
to
the
former
pair
usually
remain
perfectly
clear
illustration
crossing
the
channel
i
arrived
at
chatillon
at
midnight
on
the
defeated
and
disconsolate
but
like
a
gambler
who
loses
each
throw
only
the
more
eager
to
have
another
try
to
see
if
the
luck
would
change
and
returned
to
london
ready
to
devise
fresh
combinations
and
to
form
new
plans

when
we
arrived
upon
the
highest
summit
of

in

in
we
saw
to
our
surprise
and
disappointment
that
it
was
not
the
culminating
point
of
the
district
and
that
another
about
a
couple
of
miles
and
separated
from
us
by
an
impassable
that
distinction
i
was
troubled
in
spirit
about
this
mountain
and
my
thoughts
often
reverted
to
the
great
peak

in
apparent
inaccessibility
only
to
the

had

another
claim
to

the

the

passed
away
without

getting
to
it

was

brief
in
even
to
think
about
it

in
the

it
was
possible
and
i
resolved
to
set
my

at
rest
by
completing
the
task
which
had
been
left
unfinished
in
in
the
meantime
others
had
turned
their
attention
to
dauphin√©
first
of
all
in
came
mighty
mountaineer
whose
name
is
known
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
the
guides
michel
croz
peter
perrn
and
bartolommeo
peyrotte
and
great
success
attended
his
arms
but
tuckett
halted
before
the
pointe
des
ecrins
and
dismayed
by
its
appearance
withdrew
his
forces
to
gather
less
dangerous
laurels
elsewhere
his
expedition
however
threw
some
light
upon
the
ecrins
he
pointed
out
the
direction
from
which
an
attack
was
most
likely
to
be
successful
and
william
mathews
and
the
rev
bonney
to
whom
he
communicated
the
result
of
his
labours
attempted
to
execute
the
ascent
with
the
brothers
michel
and
j
croz
by
following
his
indications
but
they
too
were
defeated
as
i
shall
relate
more
particularly
presently
illustration
croz
the
guide
michel
croz
had
thus
been
engaged
in
both
of
these
expeditions
in
dauphin√©
and
i
naturally
looked
to
him
for
assistance
mathews
to
whom
i
applied
for
information
gave
him
a
high
character
and
concluded
his
reply
to
me
by
saying
he
was
only
happy
when
upwards
of
feet
i
know
what
my
friend
meant
croz
was
happiest
when
he
was
employing
his
powers
to
the
utmost
places
where
you
and
i
would
toil
and
sweat
and
yet
be
freezing
cold
were
bagatelles
to
him
and
it
was
only
when
he
got
above
the
range
of
ordinary
mortals
and
was
required
to
employ
his
magnificent
strength
and
to
draw
upon
his
unsurpassed
knowledge
of
ice
and
snow
that
he
could
be
said
to
be
really
and
truly
happy
of
all
the
guides
with
whom
i
travelled
michel
croz
was
the
man
who
was
most
after
my
own
heart
he
did
not
work
like
a
blunt
razor
and
take
to
his
toil
unkindly
he
did
not
need
urging
or
to
be
told
a
second
time
to
do
anything
you
had
but
to
say
was
to
be
done
and
it
was
to
be
done
and
the
work
done
if
it
was
possible
such
men
are
not
common
and
when
they
are
known
they
are
valued
michel
was
not
widely
known
but
those
who
did
know
him
employed
him
again
and
again
the
inscription
that
is
placed
upon
his
tomb
truthfully
records
that
he
was
beloved
by
his
comrades
and
esteemed
by
at
the
time
that
i
was
planning
my
journey
my
friends
moore
and
horace
walker
were
also
drawing
up
their
programme
and
as
we
found
that
our
wishes
were
very
similar
we
agreed
to
unite
our
respective
parties
the
excursions
which
are
described
in
this
and
the
two
following
chapters
are
mutual
ideas
which
were
jointly
executed
our
united
programme
was
framed
so
as
to
avoid
sleeping
in
inns
and
so
that
we
should
see
from
the
highest
point
attained
on
one
day
a
considerable
portion
of
the
route
which
was
intended
to
be
followed
on
the
next
this
latter
matter
was
an
important
one
to
us
as
all
of
our
projected
excursions
were
new
ones
and
led
over
ground
about
which
there
was
very
little
information
in
print
my
friends
had
happily
secured
christian
almer
of
grindelwald
as
their
guide
the
combination
of
croz
and
almer
was
a
perfect
one
both
men
were
in
the
prime
of
life
both
were
endued
with
strength
and
activity
far
beyond
the
average
and
the
courage
and
the
knowledge
of
each
was
alike
undoubted
the
temper
of
almer
it
was
impossible
to
ruffle
he
was
ever
obliging
and
enduring
bold
but
a
safe
man
that
which
he
lacked
in
supplied
by
croz
who
in
his
turn
was
kept
in
place
by
almer
it
is
pleasant
to
remember
how
they
worked
together
and
how
each
one
confided
to
you
that
he
liked
the
other
so
much
because
he
worked
so
well
but
it
is
sad
very
sad
to
those
who
have
known
the
men
to
know
that
they
can
never
work
together
again
we
met
at
michel
on
the
mont
cenis
road
at
midday
on
june
and
proceeded
in
the
afternoon
over
the
col
de
valloires
to
the
village
of
the
same
name
the
summit
of
this
pretty
little
pass
is
about
feet
above
michel
and
from
it
we
had
a
fair
view
of
the
aiguilles
d
arve
a
group
of
three
peaks
of
singular
form
which
it
was
our
especial
object
to
investigate
they
had
been
seen
by
ourselves
and
others
from
numerous
distant
points
and
always
looked
very
high
and
very
inaccessible
but
we
had
been
unable
to
obtain
any
information
about
them
except
the
few
words
in
joanne
s
du
having
made
out
from
the
summit
of
the
col
de
valloires
that
they
could
be
approached
from
the
valley
of
valloires
we
hastened
down
to
find
a
place
where
we
could
pass
the
night
as
near
as
possible
to
the
entrance
of
the
little
valley
leading
up
to
them
by
nightfall
we
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
this
little
valley
vallon
des
aiguilles
d
arve
and
found
some
buildings
placed
just
where
they
were
wanted
the
proprietress
received
us
with
civility
and
placed
a
large
barn
at
our
disposal
on
the
conditions
that
no
lights
were
struck
or
pipes
smoked
therein
and
when
her
terms
were
agreed
to
she
took
us
into
her
own
chalet
made
up
a
huge
fire
heated
a
gallon
of
milk
and
treated
us
with
genuine
hospitality
in
the
morning
we
found
that
the
vallon
des
aiguilles
d
arve
led
away
nearly
due
west
from
the
valley
of
valloires
and
that
the
village
of
bonnenuit
was
placed
in
the
latter
valley
almost
exactly
opposite
to
the
junction
of
the
two
at
on
the
we
set
out
up
the
vallon
passed
for
a
time
over
and
then
over
a
stony
waste
deeply
channelled
by
watercourses
at
the
two
principal
aiguilles
were
well
seen
and
as
by
this
time
it
was
evident
that
the
authors
of
the
sardinian
official
map
had
romanced
as
extensively
in
this
neighbourhood
as
elsewhere
it
was
necessary
to
hold
a
council
illustration
plan
to
show
route
three
questions
were
submitted
to
it
which
is
the
highest
of
these
aiguilles
secondly
which
shall
we
go
up
thirdly
how
is
it
to
be
done
the
french
engineers
it
was
said
had
determined
that
the
two
highest
of
them
were
respectively
and
feet
in
height
but
we
were
without
information
as
to
which
two
they
had
measured
joanne
indeed
said
but
without
specifying
whether
he
meant
all
three
that
the
aiguilles
had
been
several
times
ascended
and
particularly
mentioned
that
the
one
of
feet
was
relatively
we
therefore
said
we
will
go
up
the
peak
of
that
determination
did
not
settle
the
second
question
joanne
s
relatively
easy
peak
according
to
his
description
was
evidently
the
most
northern
of
the
three
peak
then
was
to
be
one
of
the
other
two
which
of
them
we
were
inclined
to
favour
the
central
one
but
it
was
hard
to
determine
they
looked
so
equal
in
height
when
however
the
council
came
to
study
the
third
how
is
it
to
be
done
it
was
unanimously
voted
that
upon
the
eastern
and
southern
sides
it
was
certainly
relatively
difficult
and
that
a
move
should
be
made
round
to
the
northern
side
the
movement
was
duly
executed
and
after
wading
up
some
of
considerable
steepness
going
occasionally
beyond
we
found
ourselves
in
a
gap
or
nick
between
the
central
and
northernmost
aiguille
at
we
then
studied
the
northern
face
of
our
intended
peak
and
finally
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
relatively
impracticable
croz
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
and
said
my
faith
i
think
you
will
do
well
to
leave
it
to
almer
was
more
explicit
and
volunteered
the
information
that
a
thousand
francs
would
not
tempt
him
to
it
we
then
turned
to
the
northernmost
peak
but
found
its
southern
faces
even
more
hopeless
than
the
northern
faces
of
the
central
one
we
enjoyed
accordingly
the
unwonted
luxury
of
a
rest
on
the
top
of
our
pass
for
pass
we
were
determined
it
should
be
we
might
have
done
worse
we
were
or
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
commanded
a
most
picturesque
view
of
the
mountains
of
the
tarentaise
while
somewhat
east
of
south
we
saw
the
monarch
of
the
dauphin√©
whose
closer
acquaintance
it
was
our
intention
to
make
three
sunny
hours
passed
away
and
then
we
turned
to
the
descent
we
saw
the
distant
pastures
of
a
valley
which
we
supposed
was
the
vallon
or
ravine
de
la
sausse
and
a
long
leading
down
to
them
but
from
that
slope
we
were
cut
off
by
precipitous
rocks
and
our
first
impression
was
that
we
should
have
to
return
in
our
track
some
running
up
and
down
however
discovered
two
little
gullies
filled
with
threads
of
snow
and
down
the
most
northern
of
these
we
decided
to
go
it
was
a
steep
way
but
a
safe
one
for
the
cleft
was
so
narrow
that
we
could
press
the
shoulder
against
one
side
whilst
the
feet
were
against
the
other
and
the
last
remnant
of
the
winter
s
snow
well
hardened
clung
to
the
rift
with
great
tenacity
and
gave
us
a
path
when
the
rocks
refused
one
in
we
got
to
the
top
of
the
great
walker
let
us
glissade
the
no
it
is
too
our
friend
however
started
off
at
a
standing
glissade
and
advanced
for
a
time
very
skilfully
but
after
a
while
he
lost
his
balance
and
progressed
downwards
and
backwards
with
great
rapidity
in
a
way
that
seemed
to
us
very
much
like
tumbling
head
over
heels
he
let
go
his
axe
and
left
it
behind
but
it
overtook
him
and
batted
him
heartily
he
and
it
travelled
in
this
fashion
for
some
hundreds
of
feet
and
at
last
subsided
into
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
in
a
few
moments
we
were
reassured
as
to
his
safety
by
hearing
him
ironically
request
us
not
to
keep
him
waiting
down
there

chalets

showing
route
we
others
followed
the
track
shown
by
the
dotted
line
upon
the
engraving
making
zigzags
to
avoid
the
little
groups
of
rocks
which
jutted
through
the
snow
by
which
walker
had
been
upset
descended
by
a
glissade
and
rejoined
our
friend
at
the
bottom
we
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
and
tramped
down
the
summit
ridge
of
an
old
moraine
of
great
size
its
mud
was
excessively
hard
and
where
some
large
erratic
blocks
lay
perched
upon
its
crest
we
were
obliged
to
cut
steps
in
the
mud
with
our
guided
by
the
sound
of
a
distant
moo
we
speedily
found
the
highest
chalets
in
the
valley
named
rieu
blanc
they
were
tenanted
by
three
old
women
who
seemed
to
belong
to
one
of
the
missing
links
sought
by
naturalists
destitute
of
all
ideas
except
in
regard
to
cows
and
who
spoke
a
barbarous
patois
unintelligible
to
the
savoyard
croz
they
would
not
believe
that
we
had
passed
between
the
aiguilles
it
is
impossible
the
never
go
could
we
get
to
la
grave
over
yonder
ridge
oh
yes
the
often
crossed
could
they
show
us
the
way
no
but
we
could
follow
the
we
stayed
a
while
near
these
chalets
to
examine
the
western
sides
of
the
aiguilles
d
arve
and
according
to
our
united
opinion
the
central
one
was
as
inaccessible
from
this
direction
as
from
the
east
north
or
south
on
the
following
day
we
saw
them
again
from
a
height
of
about
feet
in
a
direction
and
our
opinion
remained
unchanged
we
saw
on
june
the
central
aiguille
from
all
sides
and
very
nearly
completely
round
the
southernmost
one
the
northern
one
we
also
saw
on
all
sides
excepting
from
the
north
it
is
however
precisely
from
this
direction
joanne
says
that
its
ascent
is
relatively
easy
we
do
not
therefore
venture
to
express
any
opinion
respecting
its
ascent
except
as
regards
its
actual
summit
this
is
formed
of
two
curious
prongs
or
pinnacles
of
rock
and
we
do
not
understand
in
what
way
they
or
either
of
them
can
be
ascended
nor
shall
we
be
surprised
if
this
ascent
is
discovered
to
have
been
made
in
spirit
rather
than
body
in
fact
in
the
same
manner
as
the
celebrated
ascent
of
mont
blanc
not
entirely
to
the
summit
but
as
far
as
the
montanvert
all
three
of
the
aiguilles
be
accessible
but
they
as
inaccessible
as
anything
i
have
seen
they
are
the
highest
summits
between
the
valleys
of
the
romanche
and
the
arc
they
are
placed
slightly
to
the
north
of
the
watershed
between
those
two
valleys
and
a
line
drawn
through
them
runs
pretty
nearly
north
and
south
we
descended
by
a
rough
path
from
rieu
blanc
to
the
chalets
of
la
sausse
which
give
the
name
to
the
vallon
or
ravine
de
la
sausse
in
which
they
are
situated
this
is
one
of
the
numerous
branches
of
the
valley
that
descends
to
jean
d
arve
and
subsequently
to
jean
de
maurienne
two
passes
more
or
less
known
lead
from
this
valley
to
the
village
of
la
grave
on
the
lautaret
road
in
the
valley
of
the
romanche
viz
col
de
l
infernet
and
the
col
de
martignare
the
former
pass
was
crossed
many
years
ago
by
forbes
and
was
mentioned
by
him
in
his
and
its
the
latter
one
lies
to
the
north
of
the
former
and
is
seldom
traversed
by
tourists
but
it
was
convenient
for
us
and
we
set
out
to
cross
it
on
the
morning
of
the
after
having
passed
a
comfortable
but
not
luxurious
night
in
the
hay
at
la
sausse
where
however
the
simplicity
of
the
accommodation
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
civility
and
hospitality
of
the
people
in
charge
our
object
now
was
to
cross
to
la
grave
on
the
high
road
from
grenoble
to
brian√ßon
and
to
ascend
some
point
sufficiently
high
to
give
us
a
good
view
of
the
dauphin√©
alps
in
general
and
of
the
grand
chain
of
the
meije
in
particular
before
leaving
england
a
careful
study
of
joanne
had
elicited
the
fact
that
the
shortest
route
from
la
sausse
to
la
grave
was
by
the
col
de
martignare
and
also
that
from
the
aforesaid
col
it
was
possible
to
ascend
a
lofty
summit
called
by
him
the
also
called
aiguille
de
gol√©on
on
referring
however
to
the
sardinian
survey
we
found
there
depicted
to
the
east
of
the
col
de
martignare
not
peak
bearing
the
above
names
but
distinct
above
the
the
height
of
which
was
not
stated
the
other
still
farther
to
the
east
and
somewhat
to
the
south
of
the
aiguille
du
gol√©on
english
feet
in
height
with
a
very
considerable
glacier
the
two
on
the
french
map
on
the
other
hand
neither
of
the
above
names
was
to
be
found
but
a
peak
called
aiguille
de
la
sausse
feet
was
placed
in
the
position
assigned
to
the
in
the
sardinian
map
while
farther
to
the
east
was
a
second
and
nameless
peak
not
at
all
in
the
position
given
to
the
aiguille
du
gol√©on
of
which
and
of
the
glacier
lombard
there
was
not
a
sign
all
this
was
very
puzzling
and
unsatisfactory
but
as
we
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
climb
one
of
the
points
to
the
east
of
the
col
de
martignare
which
overhung
the
ravine
de
la
sausse
we
determined
to
make
that
col
the
basis
of
our
operations
we
left
the
chalets
at
under
a
shower
of
good
wishes
from
our
hostesses
proceeded
at
first
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
ravine
then
doubled
back
up
a
long
buttress
which
projects
in
an
unusual
way
and
went
towards
the
col
de
martignare
but
before
arriving
at
its
summit
we
again
doubled
and
resumed
the
original
course
at
we
stood
on
the
watershed
and
followed
it
towards
the
east
keeping
for
some
distance
strictly
to
the
ridge
and
afterwards
diverging
a
little
to
the
south
to
avoid
a
considerable
secondary
aiguille
which
prevented
a
straight
track
being
made
to
the
summit
at
which
we
were
aiming
at
we
stood
on
its
top
and
saw
at
once
the
lay
of
the
land
we
found
that
our
peak
was
one
of
four
which
enclosed
a
plateau
that
was
filled
by
a
glacier
let
us
call
these
summits
see
plan
on
we
stood
upon
which
was
almost
exactly
the
same
elevation
as
but
was
higher
than
and
lower
than
peak
was
the
highest
of
the
four
and
was
about
feet
higher
than
and
we
identified
it
as
the
aiguille
de
gol√©on
french
survey
feet
peak
we
considered
was
the
and
in
default
of
other
names
we
called
and
the
aiguilles
de
la
sausse
the
glacier
flowed
in
a
direction
and
was
the
glacier
lombard
peaks
and
overhung
the
ravine
de
la
sausse
and
were
connected
with
another
did
the
same
a
continuation
of
the
ridge
out
of
which
these
three
aiguilles
rose
joined
the
aiguilles
d
arve
the
head
of
the
ravine
de
la
sausse
was
therefore
encircled
by
six
peaks
three
of
which
it
was
convenient
to
term
the
aiguilles
de
la
sausse
and
the
others
were
the
aiguilles
d
arve
we
were
very
fortunate
in
the
selection
of
our
summit
not
to
speak
of
other
things
it
gave
a
grand
view
of
the
ridge
which
culminates
in
the
peak
called
la
meije
feet
which
used
to
be
mentioned
by
travellers
under
the
name
aiguille
du
midi
de
la
grave
the
view
of
this
mountain
from
the
village
of
la
grave
itself
can
hardly
be
praised
too
highly
is
one
of
the
very
finest
in
the
alps
the
ortler
spitz
from
the
stelvio
is
in
fact
its
only
worthy
competitor
and
the
opinions
generally
of
those
who
have
seen
the
two
views
are
in
favour
of
the
former
but
from
la
grave
one
can
no
more
appreciate
the
noble
proportions
and
the
towering
height
of
the
meije
than
understand
the
symmetry
of
the
dome
of
paul
s
by
gazing
upon
it
from
the
churchyard
to
see
it
fairly
one
must
be
placed
at
a
greater
distance
and
at
a
greater
height
i
shall
not
try
to
describe
the
meije
the
same
words
and
the
same
phrases
have
to
do
duty
for
one
and
another
mountain
their
repetition
becomes
wearisome
and
tis
a
discouraging
fact
that
any
description
however
true
or
however
elaborated
seldom
or
never
gives
an
idea
of
the
reality
yet
the
meije
deserves
more
than
a
passing
notice
it
was
the
last
great
alpine
peak
which
knew
the
foot
of
man
and
one
can
scarcely
speak
in
exaggerated
terms
of
its
jagged
ridges
torrential
glaciers
and
tremendous
precipices
but
were
i
to
discourse
upon
these
things
without
the
aid
of
pictures
or
to
endeavour
to
convey
in
a
sense
of
the
loveliness
of
of
the
beauty
of
or
of
the
harmonies
of
i
should
try
to
accomplish
that
which
is
impossible
and
at
the
best
should
succeed
in
but
giving
an
impression
that
the
things
spoken
of
may
have
been
pleasant
to
hear
or
to
behold
although
they
are
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
read
about
let
me
therefore
avoid
these
things
not
because
i
have
no
love
for
or
thought
of
them
but
because
they
can
not
be
translated
into
language
and
presently
when
topographical
details
must
of
necessity
be
returned
to
again
i
will
endeavour
to
relieve
the
poverty
of
the
pen
by
a
free
use
of
the
pencil
whilst
we
sat
upon
the
aiguille
de
la
sausse
our
attention
was
concentrated
on
a
point
that
was
immediately
a
gap
or
cleft
between
the
meije
and
the
mountain
called
the
rateau
it
was
indeed
in
order
to
have
a
good
view
of
this
place
that
we
made
the
ascent
of
the
aiguille
it
that
is
the
gap
itself
looked
as
my
companions
remarked
obtrusively
and
offensively
a
pass
it
had
not
been
crossed
but
it
ought
to
have
been
and
this
seemed
to
have
been
recognised
by
the
natives
who
called
it
very
appropriately
the
br√®che
de
la
meije
i
had
seen
the
place
in
and
again
in
but
had
not
then
thought
about
getting
through
it
and
our
information
in
respect
to
it
was
chiefly
derived
from
a
photographic
reproduction
of
the
then
unpublished
sheet
of
the
great
map
of
france
which
tuckett
with
his
usual
liberality
had
placed
at
our
disposal
it
was
evident
from
this
map
that
if
we
could
succeed
in
passing
the
br√®che
we
should
make
the
most
direct
route
between
the
village
of
la
grave
and
that
of
b√©rarde
in
the
department
of
the
is√®re
and
that
the
distance
between
these
two
places
by
this
route
would
be
less
than
that
of
the
ordinary
way
via
the
villages
of
freney
and
venos
it
may
occur
to
some
of
my
readers
why
had
it
not
been
done
before
for
the
very
sound
reason
that
the
valley
on
its
southern
side
vallon
des
etan√ßons
is
uninhabited
and
la
b√©rarde
itself
is
a
miserable
village
without
interest
without
commerce
and
almost
without
population
why
then
did
we
wish
to
cross
it
because
we
were
bound
to
the
pointe
des
ecrins
to
which
la
b√©rarde
was
the
nearest
inhabited
place
when
we
sat
upon
the
aiguille
de
la
sausse
we
were
rather
despondent
about
our
prospects
of
crossing
the
br√®che
which
seemed
to
present
a
combination
of
all
that
was
formidable
there
was
evidently
but
one
way
by
which
it
could
be
approached
we
saw
that
at
the
top
of
the
pass
there
was
a
steep
wall
of
snow
or
ice
so
steep
that
it
was
most
likely
ice
protected
at
its
base
by
a
big
schrund
or
moat
which
severed
it
from
the
below
then
tracking
our
course
downwards
we
saw
undulating
leading
down
to
a
great
glacier
the
would
be
easy
work
but
the
glacier
was
riven
and
broken
in
every
direction
huge
crevasses
seemed
to
extend
entirely
across
it
in
some
places
and
everywhere
it
had
that
strange
twisted
look
which
tells
of
the
unequal
motion
of
the
ice
where
could
we
get
on
to
it
at
its
base
it
came
to
a
violent
end
being
cut
short
by
a
cliff
over
which
it
poured
periodical
avalanches
as
we
saw
by
a
great
triangular
bed
of
d√©bris
below
we
could
not
venture
there
glacier
must
be
taken
in
flank
but
on
which
side
not
on
the
west
one
could
climb
those
cliffs
it
must
if
any
where
be
by
the
rocks
on
the
east
and
looked
as
if
they
were
so
we
hurried
down
to
la
grave
to
hear
what
melchior
anderegg
who
had
just
passed
through
the
village
with
the
family
of
our
friend
walker
had
to
say
on
the
matter
who
is
melchior
anderegg
those
who
ask
the
question
can
not
have
been
in
alpine
switzerland
where
the
name
of
melchior
is
as
well
known
as
the
name
of
napoleon
melchior
too
is
an
emperor
in
his
very
prince
among
guides
his
empire
is
amongst
the
eternal
snows
sceptre
is
an
melchior
anderegg
more
familiarly
and
perhaps
more
generally
known
simply
as
melchior
was
born
at
zaun
near
meiringen
on
april
he
was
first
brought
into
public
notice
in
hinchcliff
s
months
in
the
and
was
known
to
very
few
persons
at
the
time
that
little
work
was
published
in
he
was
boots
at
the
grimsel
hotel
and
in
those
days
when
he
went
out
on
expeditions
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
his
master
the
proprietor
melchior
himself
only
got
the
in
he
migrated
to
the
schwarenbach
inn
on
the
gemmi
where
he
employed
his
time
in
carving
objects
for
sale
in
he
made
numerous
expeditions
with
hinchcliff
and
stephen
and
proved
to
his
employers
that
he
possessed
skill
indomitable
courage
and
an
admirable
character
his
position
has
never
been
doubtful
since
that
year
and
for
a
long
time
there
has
been
no
guide
whose
services
have
been
more
in
request
he
is
usually
engaged
a
year
in
advance
it
would
be
almost
an
easier
task
to
say
what
he
has
not
done
than
to
catalogue
his
achievements
invariable
success
attends
his
arms
he
leads
his
followers
to
victory
but
not
to
death
i
believe
that
no
serious
accident
has
ever
befallen
travellers
in
his
charge
like
his
friend
almer
he
can
be
called
a
man
it
is
the
highest
praise
that
can
be
given
to
a
guide

melchior

in
early
in
the
afternoon
we
found
ourselves
in
the
little
inn
at
la
grave
on
the
great
lautaret
road
a
rickety
sort
of
place
with
nothing
stable
about
it
as
moore
wittily
remarked
except
the
smell
melchior
had
gone
and
had
left
behind
a
note
which
said
i
think
the
passage
of
the
br√®che
is
possible
but
that
it
will
be
very
his
opinion
coincided
with
ours
and
we
went
to
sleep
expecting
to
be
afoot
about
eighteen
or
twenty
hours
on
the
morrow
at
the
next
morning
we
left
la
grave
in
a
few
minutes
crossed
the
romanche
and
at
got
to
the
moraine
of
the
eastern
branch
of
the
glacier
that
descends
from
the
br√®che
the
rocks
by
which
we
intended
to
ascend
were
placed
between
the
two
branches
of
this
glacier
and
still
looked
smooth
and
unbroken
by
o
clock
we
were
upon
them
and
saw
that
we
had
been
deluded
by
them
no
carpenter
could
have
planned
a
more
convenient
staircase
they
were
their
smooth
look
from
a
distance
was
only
owing
to
their
singular
firmness
it
was
really
quite
a
pleasure
to
scale
such
delightful
rocks
we
felt
the
stone
held
the
boot
so
well
that
without
making
a
positive
effort
to
do
so
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
slip
in
an
hour
we
had
risen
above
the
most
crevassed
portion
of
the
glacier
and
began
to
look
for
a
way
on
to
it
just
at
the
right
place
there
was
a
patch
of
old
snow
at
the
side
and
instead
of
gaining
the
ice
by
desperate
acrobatic
feats
we
passed
from
the
rocks
on
to
it
as
easily
as
one
walks
across
a
gangway
at
we
were
on
the
centre
of
the
glacier
and
the
inhabitants
of
la
grave
turned
out
into
the
road
and
watched
us
with
amazement
as
they
witnessed
the
falsification
of
their
confident
predictions
well
might
they
stare
for
our
little
caravan
looking
to
them
like
a
train
of
flies
on
a
wall
crept
up
and
up
without
hesitation
and
without
a
to
their
sight
one
minute
as
it
dived
into
a
crevasse
then
seen
again
clambering
up
the
other
side
the
higher
we
rose
the
easier
became
the
work
the
angles
lessened
and
our
pace
increased
the
snow
remained
shadowed
and
we
walked
as
easily
as
on
a
high
road
and
when
at
the
summit
of
the
br√®che
was
seen
we
rushed
at
it
as
furiously
as
if
it
had
been
a
breach
in
the
wall
of
a
fortress
carried
the
moat
by
a
dash
with
a
push
behind
and
a
pull
before
stormed
the
steep
slope
above
and
at
stood
in
the
little
gap
feet
above
the
level
of
the

the
br√®che
was
won

they
stare
five
hours
and

quarter
had
sufficed
for

screamed
triumphantly

all
mountaineers
know
how
valuable
it
is
to
study
beforehand
an
intended
route
over
new
ground
from
a
height
at
some
distance
none
but
blunderers
fail
to
do
so
if
it
is
possible
and
one
can
not
do
so
too
thoroughly
as
a
rule
the
closer
one
approaches
underneath
a
summit
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
pick
out
a
path
with
judgment
inferior
peaks
seem
unduly
important
subordinate
ridges
are
exalted
and
slopes
conceal
points
beyond
and
if
one
blindly
undertakes
an
ascent
without
having
acquired
a
tolerable
notion
of
the
relative
importance
of
the
parts
and
of
their
positions
to
one
another
it
will
be
miraculous
if
great
difficulties
are
not
encountered
but
although
the
examination
of
an
intended
route
from
a
height
at
a
distance
will
tell
one
who
knows
the
meaning
of
the
things
he
is
looking
at
a
good
deal
and
will
enable
him
to
steer
clear
of
many
difficulties
against
which
he
might
otherwise
blindly
run
it
will
seldom
allow
one
to
pronounce
positively
upon
the
practicability
or
impracticability
of
the
whole
of
the
route
no
living
man
for
example
can
pronounce
positively
from
a
distance
in
regard
to
rocks
those
just
mentioned
are
an
illustration
of
this
three
of
the
ablest
and
most
experienced
guides
concurred
in
thinking
that
they
would
be
found
very
difficult
and
yet
they
presented
no
difficulty
whatever
in
truth
the
sounder
and
less
broken
up
are
the
rocks
the
more
impracticable
do
they
usually
look
from
a
distance
while
soft
and
easily
rent
rocks
which
are
often
amongst
the
most
difficult
and
perilous
to
climb
very
frequently
look
from
afar
as
if
they
might
be
traversed
by
a
child
it
is
possible
to
decide
with
greater
certainty
in
regard
to
the
practicability
of
glaciers
when
one
is
seen
to
have
few
open
crevasses
and
this
may
be
told
from
a
great
distance
then
we
know
that
it
is
to
traverse
it
but
to
what
extent
it
or
a
glacier
that
is
much
broken
up
by
crevasses
will
be
troublesome
will
depend
upon
the
width
and
length
of
the
crevasses
and
upon
the
angles
of
the
surface
of
the
glacier
itself
a
glacier
may
be
greatly
crevassed
but
the
fissures
may
be
so
narrow
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
deviate
from
a
straight
line
when
passing
across
them
or
a
glacier
may
have
few
open
crevasses
and
yet
may
be
practically
impassable
on
account
of
the
steepness
of
the
angles
of
its
surface
nominally
a
man
with
an
axe
can
go
anywhere
upon
a
glacier
but
in
practice
it
is
found
that
to
move
freely
upon
ice
one
must
have
to
deal
only
with
small
angles
it
is
thus
necessary
to
know
approximately
the
angles
of
the
surfaces
of
a
glacier
before
it
is
possible
to
determine
whether
it
will
afford
easy
travelling
or
will
be
so
difficult
as
to
be
for
all
practical
purposes
impassable
this
can
not
be
told
by
looking
at
glaciers
in
full
face
from
a
distance
they
must
be
seen
in
profile
and
it
is
often
desirable
to
examine
them
both
from
the
front
and
in
profile
do
the
first
to
study
the
direction
of
the
crevasses
to
note
where
they
are
most
and
least
numerous
and
the
second
to
see
whether
its
angles
are
moderate
or
great
should
they
be
very
steep
it
may
be
better
to
avoid
them
altogether
and
to
mount
even
by
difficult
rocks
but
upon
glaciers
of
inclination
and
with
few
open
crevasses
better
progress
can
always
be
made
than
upon
the
rocks
so
much
to
explain
why
we
were
deceived
when
looking
at
the
br√®che
de
la
meije
from
the
aiguille
de
la
sausse
we
took
note
of
all
the
difficulties
but
did
not
pay
sufficient
attention
to
the
distance
that
the
br√®che
was
south
of
la
grave
my
meaning
will
be
apparent
from
the
accompanying
diagram
fig
constructed
upon
the
data
supplied
by
the
french
surveyors
which
will
also
serve
to
illustrate
how
badly
angles
of
elevation
are
judged
by
the
unaided
eye
illustration
diagram
to
show
angle
of
summit
of
meije
etc
the
village
of
la
grave
is
just
feet
and
the
highest
summit
of
the
meije
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
there
is
therefore
a
difference
in
their
levels
of
feet
but
the
summit
of
the
meije
is
south
of
la
grave
about
feet
and
consequently
a
line
drawn
from
la
grave
to
the
summit
of
the
meije
is
no
steeper
than
the
dotted
line
drawn
from
to
fig
or
in
other
words
if
one
could
go
in
a
direct
line
from
la
grave
to
the
summit
of
the
meije
the
ascent
would
be
at
an
angle
of
less
than
nine
persons
out
of
ten
would
probably
estimate
the
angle
on
the
spot
at
double
this
amount
the
br√®che
is
feet
below
the
summit
of
the
meije
and
only
feet
above
la
grave
a
direct
ascent
from
the
village
to
the
br√®che
would
consequently
be
at
an
angle
of
not
much
more
than
but
it
is
not
possible
to
make
the
ascent
as
the
crow
flies
it
has
to
be
made
by
an
indirect
and
much
longer
route
our
track
was
probably
double
the
length
of
a
direct
line
between
the
two
places
doubling
the
length
halved
the
angles
and
we
therefore
arrive
at
the
somewhat
amazing
conclusion
that
upon
this
one
of
the
steepest
passes
in
the
alps
the
mean
of
all
the
angles
upon
the
ascent
could
not
have
been
greater
than
or
of
course
in
some
places
the
angles
were
much
steeper
and
in
others
less
but
the
of
the
whole
could
not
have
passed
the
angle
above
indicated

looking
towards
la
b√©rarde
we
did
not
trouble
ourselves
much
with
these
matters
when
we
sat
on
the
top
of
the
br√®che
our
day
s
work
was
as
good
as
over
for
we
knew
from
mathews
and
bonney
that
there
was
no
difficulty
upon
the
other
side
and
we
abandoned
ourselves
to
ease
and
luxury
wondering
alternately
as
we
gazed
upon
the
rateau
and
the
ecrins
how
the
one
mountain
could
possibly
hold
itself
together
and
whether
the
other
would
hold
out
against
us
the
former
looked
so
rotten
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
puff
of
wind
or
a
clap
of
thunder
might
dash
the
whole
fabric
to
pieces
while
the
latter
asserted
itself
the
monarch
of
the
group
and
towered
head
and
shoulders
above
all
the
rest
of
the
peaks
which
form
the
great
of
dauphin√©
at
length
a
cruel
rush
of
cold
air
made
us
shiver
and
shift
our
quarters
to
a
little
grassy
plot
feet
oasis
in
a
we
lay
nearly
four
hours
admiring
the
splendid
wall
of
the
meije
then
we
tramped
down
the
vallon
des
etan√ßons
a
howling
wilderness
the
abomination
of
desolation
destitute
alike
of
animal
or
vegetable
life
pathless
of
course
suggestive
of
chaos
but
of
little
else
covered
almost
throughout
its
entire
length
with
d√©bris
from
the
size
of
a
walnut
up
to
that
of
a
house
in
a
word
it
looked
as
if
moraines
of
dimensions
had
been
carted
and
shot
into
it
our
tempers
were
soured
by
constant
pitfalls
it
was
impossible
to
take
the
eyes
from
the
feet
and
if
an
unlucky
individual
so
much
as
blew
his
nose
without
standing
still
to
perform
the
operation
the
result
was
either
an
instantaneous
tumble
or
a
barked
shin
or
a
ankle
there
was
no
end
to
it
and
we
became
more
savage
at
every
step
unanimously
agreeing
that
no
power
on
earth
would
ever
induce
us
to
walk
up
or
down
this
particular
valley
again
it
was
not
just
to
the
valley
which
was
enclosed
by
noble
mountains
it
is
true
but
worthy
of
a
great
reputation
and
which
if
placed
in
other
districts
would
be
sought
after
and
cited
as
types
of
daring

and
graceful

the

with
high

rearing
their

as
if

crowned
with

and
fissured
with
immense

where
lie
the
eternal

guarded
by
bare
and

offering
the

is

o

on
the
afternoon
of
june
we
were
trotting
down
the
steep
path
that
leads
into
la
b√©rarde
we
put
up
of
course
with
the
rodier
who
as
usual
was
smooth
and
smiling
and
after
congratulations
were
over
we
returned
to
the
exterior
to
watch
for
the
arrival
of
one
alexander
pic
who
had
been
sent
overnight
with
our
baggage
freney
and
venos
but
when
the
night
fell
and
no
pic
appeared
we
saw
that
our
plans
must
be
modified
for
he
was
necessary
to
our
very
carried
our
food
our
tobacco
our
all
so
after
some
discussion
it
was
agreed
that
a
portion
of
our
programme
should
be
abandoned
that
the
night
of
the
should
be
passed
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
de
la
bonne
pierre
and
that
on
the
a
push
should
be
made
for
the
summit
of
the
ecrins
we
then
went
to
straw
our
porter
pic
strolled
in
next
morning
with
a
very
jaunty
air
and
we
seized
upon
our
but
upon
looking
for
the
cigars
we
found
starvation
staring
us
in
the
face
hullo
monsieur
pic
where
are
our
cigars
gentlemen
he
began
i
am
desolated
and
then
quite
pat
he
told
a
long
rigmarole
about
a
fit
on
the
road
of
brigands
thieves
of
their
ransacking
the
knapsacks
when
he
was
insensible
and
of
finding
them
gone
when
he
revived
ah
monsieur
pic
we
see
what
it
is
you
have
smoked
them
yourself
gentlemen
i
never
smoke
whereupon
we
inquired
secretly
if
he
was
known
to
smoke
and
found
that
he
was
however
he
said
that
he
had
never
spoken
truer
words
and
perhaps
he
had
not
for
he
is
reported
to
be
the
greatest
liar
in
dauphin√©
illustration
map
of
the
central
dauphin√©
alps
we
were
now
able
to
start
and
set
out
at
to
bivouac
upon
the
glacier
de
la
bonne
pierre
accompanied
by
rodier
who
staggered
under
a
load
of
blankets
many
slopes
had
to
be
mounted
and
many
torrents
to
be
crossed
all
of
which
has
been
described
by
mr
tuckett
we
however
avoided
the
difficulties
he
experienced
with
the
latter
by
crossing
them
high
up
where
they
were
subdivided
but
when
we
got
on
to
the
moraine
on
the
right
bank
of
the
glacier
or
properly
speaking
on
to
one
of
the
moraines
for
there
are
several
mists
descended
to
our
great
hindrance
and
it
was
before
we
arrived
on
the
spot
at
which
it
was
intended
to
camp
each
one
selected
his
nook
and
we
then
joined
round
a
grand
fire
made
by
our
men
fortnum
and
mason
s
portable
soup
was
sliced
up
and
brewed
and
was
excellent
but
it
should
be
said
that
before
it
excellent
three
times
the
quantity
named
in
the
directions
had
to
be
used
art
is
required
in
drinking
as
in
making
this
soup
and
one
point
is
let
your
friends
drink
first
not
only
because
it
is
more
polite
but
because
the
soup
has
a
tendency
to
burn
the
mouth
if
taken
too
hot
and
one
drink
of
the
bottom
is
worth
two
of
the
top
as
all
the
goodness
settles
while
engaged
in
these
operations
the
mist
that
enveloped
the
glacier
and
surrounding
peaks
was
becoming
thinner
little
bits
of
blue
sky
appeared
here
and
there
until
suddenly
when
we
were
looking
towards
the
head
of
the
glacier
far
far
above
us
at
an
almost
inconceivable
height
in
a
tiny
patch
of
blue
appeared
a
wonderful
rocky
pinnacle
bathed
in
the
beams
of
the
sun
we
were
so
electrified
by
the
glory
of
the
sight
that
it
was
some
seconds
before
we
realised
what
we
saw
and
understood
that
that
astounding
point
removed
apparently
miles
from
the
earth
was
one
of
the
highest
summits
of
les
ecrins
and
that
we
hoped
before
another
sun
had
set
to
have
stood
upon
an
even
loftier
pinnacle
the
mists
rose
and
fell
presenting
us
with
a
series
of
dissolving
views
of
ravishing
grandeur
and
finally
died
away
leaving
the
glacier
and
its
mighty
bounding
precipices
under
an
exquisite
pale
blue
sky
free
from
a
single
speck
of
cloud
the
night
passed
over
without
anything
worth
mention
but
we
had
had
occasion
to
observe
in
the
morning
an
instance
of
the
curious
evaporation
that
is
frequently
noticeable
in
the
high
alps
on
the
previous
night
we
had
hung
up
on
a
knob
of
rock
our
mackintosh
bag
containing
five
bottles
of
rodier
s
bad
wine
in
the
morning
although
the
stopper
appeared
to
have
been
in
all
night
about
had
evaporated
it
was
strange
my
friends
had
not
taken
any
neither
had
i
and
the
guides
each
declared
that
they
had
not
seen
any
one
touch
it
in
fact
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
but
in
the
dryness
of
the
air
still
it
is
remarkable
that
the
dryness
of
the
air
or
the
evaporation
of
wine
is
always
greatest
when
a
stranger
is
in
one
s
dryness
caused
by
the
presence
of
even
a
single
chamounix
porter
is
sometimes
so
great
that
not
but
the
entire
quantity
disappears
for
a
time
i
found
difficulty
in
combating
this
phenomenon
but
at
last
discovered
that
if
i
used
the
as
a
pillow
during
the
night
the
evaporation
was
completely
stopped
at
we
moved
off
across
the
glacier
in
single
file
towards
the
foot
of
a
great
gully
which
led
from
the
upper
slopes
of
the
glacier
de
la
bonne
pierre
to
the
lowest
point
in
the
ridge
that
runs
from
the
ecrins
to
the
mountain
called
roche
faurio
by
rodier
who
now
returned
with
his
wraps
to
la
b√©rarde
this
gully
or
was
discovered
and
descended
by
tuckett
and
we
will
now
return
for
a
minute
to
the
explorations
of
that
accomplished
mountaineer
in
the
year
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
from
the
de
la
at
paris
a
copy
of
the
then
unpublished
sheet
of
the
map
of
france
and
with
it
in
hand
he
swept
backwards
and
forwards
across
the
central
dauphin√©
alps
untroubled
by
the
doubts
as
to
the
identity
of
peaks
which
had
perplexed
macdonald
and
myself
in
and
enlightened
by
it
he
was
able
to
point
out
which
he
did
in
the
fairest
manner
that
we
had
confounded
the
ecrins
with
another
pic
sans
nom
we
made
this
blunder
through
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
district
and
inaccurate
reports
of
the
natives
it
was
not
an
extraordinary
one
the
two
mountains
are
not
unlike
each
other
considering
the
difficulty
that
there
is
in
obtaining
from
any
except
the
very
highest
summits
a
complete
view
of
this
intricate
group
the
situations
of
the
principal
summits
can
be
perceived
at
a
glance
on
the
accompanying
map
which
is
a
reproduction
of
a
portion
of
sheet
the
main
ridge
of
the
chain
runs
at
this
part
nearly
north
and
south
roche
faurio
at
the
northern
extreme
is
m√®tres
or
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
lowest
point
between
that
mountain
and
the
ecrins
the
col
des
ecrins
is
feet
the
ridge
again
rises
and
passes
feet
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ecrins
the
highest
summit
of
that
mountain
feet
is
however
placed
a
little
to
the
east
of
and
off
the
main
ridge
it
then
again
falls
and
in
the
vicinity
of
the
col
de
la
tempe
it
is
perhaps
below
feet
but
immediately
to
the
south
of
the
summit
of
that
pass
there
is
upon
the
ridge
a
point
which
has
been
determined
by
the
french
surveyors
to
be
feet
this
peak
is
without
a
name
the
ridge
continues
to
gain
height
as
we
come
to
the
south
and
culminates
in
the
mountain
which
the
french
surveyors
have
called
sommet
de
l
aile
froide
on
the
spot
it
is
called
very
commonly
the
al√©froide
there
is
some
uncertainty
respecting
the
elevation
of
this
mountain
the
frenchmen
give
m√®tres
as
its
highest
point
but
tuckett
who
took
a
good
theodolite
to
the
top
of
mont
pelvoux
which
he
agreed
with
his
predecessors
had
an
elevation
of
feet
found
that
the
summit
of
the
al√©froide
was
elevated
above
his
station
and
as
the
distance
between
the
two
points
was
feet
this
would
represent
a
difference
in
altitude
of
m√®tres
in
favour
of
the
al√©froide
i
saw
this
mountain
from
the
summit
of
mont
pelvoux
in
and
was
in
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
two
was
the
higher
and
in
from
the
summit
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
as
will
presently
be
related
it
looked
actually
higher
than
mont
pelvoux
i
have
therefore
little
doubt
but
that
tuckett
is
right
in
believing
the
al√©froide
to
have
an
elevation
of
about
feet
instead
of
as
determined
by
the
french
surveyors
mont
pelvoux
is
to
the
east
of
the
al√©froide
and
off
the
main
ridge
and
the
pic
sans
nom
feet
is
placed
between
these
two
mountains
the
latter
is
one
of
the
grandest
of
the
dauphin√©
peaks
but
it
is
shut
in
by
the
other
mountains
and
is
seldom
seen
except
from
a
distance
and
then
is
usually
confounded
with
the
neighbouring
summits
its
name
has
been
accidentally
omitted
on
the
map
but
its
situation
is
represented
by
the
large
patch
of
rocks
nearly
surrounded
by
glaciers
that
is
seen
between
the
words
ailefroide
and
mt
pelvoux
the
lowest
depression
on
the
main
ridge
to
the
south
of
the
al√©froide
is
the
col
du
sel√©
and
this
according
to
tuckett
is
feet
the
ridge
soon
rises
again
and
a
little
farther
to
the
south
joins
another
ridge
running
nearly
east
and
west
to
a
mountain
at
the
junction
of
these
two
ridges
the
frenchmen
have
given
the
singular
name
cr√™te
des
b≈ìufs
rouges
the
highest
point
hereabouts
is
feet
and
a
little
to
the
west
there
is
another
peak
mont
bans
of
feet
the
main
ridge
runs
from
this
point
in
a
direction
to
the
cols
de
says
both
of
which
exceed
feet
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
general
elevation
of
this
main
ridge
is
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
range
of
mont
blanc
or
of
the
central
pennine
alps
and
if
we
were
to
follow
it
out
more
completely
or
to
follow
the
other
ridges
surrounding
or
radiating
from
it
we
should
find
that
there
is
a
remarkable
absence
throughout
the
entire
district
of
low
gaps
and
depressions
and
that
there
are
an
extraordinary
number
of
peaks
of
medium
elevation
the
difficulty
which
explorers
have
experienced
in
dauphin√©
in
identifying
peaks
has
very
much
arisen
from
the
elevation
of
the
ridges
generally
being
more
uniform
than
is
commonly
found
in
the
alps
and
the
consequent
facile
concealment
of
one
point
by
another
the
difficulty
has
been
enhanced
by
the
narrowness
and
erratic
courses
of
the
valleys
the
possession
of
the
advanced
copy
of
sheet
of
the
french
map
enabled
tuckett
to
grasp
most
of
what
i
have
just
said
and
much
more
and
he
added
in
three
interesting
passes
across
this
part
of
the
chain
to
those
already
known
the
first
from
ville
vallouise
to
la
b√©rarde
the
village
of
claux
and
the
glaciers
du
sel√©
and
de
la
pilatte
he
called
the
col
du
sel√©
the
second
between
ville
vallouise
and
villar
d
ar√®ne
on
the
lautaret
road
claux
and
the
glaciers
blanc
and
d
arsine
col
du
glacier
blanc
and
the
third
from
vallouise
to
la
b√©rarde
the
glacier
blanc
the
glacier
de
l
encula
and
the
glacier
de
la
bonne
pierre
the
col
des
ecrins
this
last
pass
was
discovered
accidentally
tuckett
set
out
intending
to
endeavour
to
ascend
the
pointe
des
ecrins
but
circumstances
were
against
him
as
he
relates
in
the
following
words
arrived
on
the
plateau
of
the
glacier
de
l
encula
a
most
striking
view
of
the
ecrins
burst
upon
us
and
a
hasty
inspection
encouraged
us
to
hope
that
its
ascent
would
be
practicable
on
the
sides
of
la
b√©rarde
and
the
glacier
noir
it
presents
as
has
been
already
stated
the
most
precipitous
and
inaccessible
faces
that
can
well
be
conceived
but
in
the
direction
of
the
glacier
de
l
encula
as
the
upper
plateau
of
the
glacier
blanc
is
named
on
the
french
map
the
slopes
are
less
rapid
and
immense
masses
of
and
cover
it
nearly
to
the
the
snow
was
in
very
bad
order
and
as
we
sank
at
each
step
above
the
knee
it
soon
became
evident
that
our
prospects
of
success
were
extremely
doubtful
a
nearer
approach
too
disclosed
traces
of
fresh
avalanches
and
after
much
deliberation
and
a
careful
examination
through
the
telescope
it
was
decided
that
the
chances
in
our
favour
were
too
small
to
render
it
desirable
to
waste
time
in
the
attempt
i
examined
the
map
from
which
i
perceived
that
the
glacier
seen
through
the
gap
in
the
ridge
running
from
roche
faurio
to
the
ecrins
to
the
west
at
a
great
depth
below
must
be
that
of
la
bonne
pierre
and
if
a
descent
to
its
head
was
practicable
a
passage
might
probably
be
effected
to
la
b√©rarde
on
suggesting
to
croz
and
perrn
that
though
baffled
by
the
state
of
the
snow
on
the
ecrins
we
might
still
achieve
something
of
interest
and
importance
by
discovering
a
new
col
they
both
heartily
assented
and
in
a
few
minutes
perrn
was
over
the
edge
and
cutting
his
way
down
the
rather
formidable
etc
etc
this
was
the
couloir
at
the
foot
of
which
we
found
ourselves
at
daybreak
on
the
of
june
but
before
commencing
the
relation
of
our
doings
upon
that
eventful
day
i
must
recount
the
experiences
of
mathews
and
bonney
in
these
gentlemen
with
the
two
croz
s
attempted
the
ascent
of
the
ecrins
a
few
weeks
after
tuckett
had
inspected
the
mountain
on
august
says
bonney
we
pushed
on
and
our
hopes
each
moment
rose
higher
and
higher
even
the
cautious
michel
committed
himself
so
far
as
to
cry
ah
malheureux
ecrins
vous
serez
bient√¥t
morts
as
we
addressed
ourselves
to
the
last
slope
leading
up
to
the
foot
of
the
final
cone
the
old
proverb
about
many
a
slip
was
however
to
prove
true
on
this
occasion
arrived
at
the
top
of
this
slope
we
found
that
we
were
cut
off
from
the
peak
by
a
formidable
bergschrund
crossed
by
the
rottenest
of
we
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
to
see
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
get
on
either
ar√™te
at
its
extremity
but
instead
of
rising
directly
from
the
snow
as
they
appeared
to
do
from
below
they
were
terminated
by
a
wall
of
rock
some
forty
feet
high
there
was
but
one
place
where
the
bergschrund
was
narrow
enough
to
admit
of
crossing
and
there
a
cliff
of
ice
had
to
be
climbed
and
then
a
path
to
be
cut
up
a
steep
slope
of
snow
before
the
ar√™te
could
be
reached
at
last
after
searching
in
vain
for
some
time
michel
bade
us
wait
a
little
and
started
off
to
explore
the
gap
separating
the
highest
peak
from
the
on
the
right
and
see
if
it
were
possible
to
ascend
the
rocky
wall
presently
he
appeared
evidently
climbing
with
difficulty
and
at
last
stood
on
the
ar√™te
itself
again
we
thought
the
victory
was
won
and
started
off
to
follow
him
suddenly
he
called
to
us
to
halt
and
turned
to
descend
in
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
after
a
long
pause
he
shouted
to
his
brother
saying
that
he
was
not
able
to
return
by
the
way
he
had
ascended
jean
was
evidently
uneasy
about
him
and
for
some
time
we
watched
him
with
much
anxiety
at
length
he
began
to
hew
out
steps
in
the
snow
along
the
face
of
the
peak
towards
us
jean
now
left
us
and
making
for
the
mentioned
above
chopped
away
until
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
labour
he
contrived
somehow
or
other
to
worm
himself
up
it
and
began
to
cut
steps
to
meet
his
brother
almost
every
step
appeared
to
be
cut
right
through
the
snowy
crust
into
the
hard
ice
below
and
an
incipient
stream
of
snow
came
hissing
down
the
sides
of
the
peak
as
they
dug
it
away
with
their
axes
michel
could
not
have
been
much
more
than
yards
from
us
and
yet
it
was
full
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
the
brothers
met
this
done
they
descended
carefully
burying
their
deep
in
the
snow
at
every
step
michel
s
account
was
that
he
had
reached
the
ar√™te
with
great
difficulty
and
saw
that
it
was
practicable
for
some
distance
in
fact
as
far
as
he
could
see
but
that
the
snow
was
in
a
most
dangerous
condition
being
very
incoherent
and
resting
on
hard
ice
that
when
he
began
to
descend
in
order
to
tell
us
this
he
found
the
rocks
so
smooth
and
slippery
that
return
was
impossible
and
that
for
some
little
time
he
feared
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
extricate
himself
and
was
in
considerable
danger
of
course
the
ar√™te
could
have
been
reached
by
the
way
our
guides
had
descended
but
it
was
so
evident
that
their
judgment
was
against
proceeding
that
we
did
not
feel
justified
in
urging
them
on
we
had
seen
so
much
of
them
that
we
felt
sure
they
would
never
hang
back
unless
there
was
real
danger
and
so
we
gave
the
word
for
on
both
of
these
expeditions
there
was
fine
weather
and
plenty
of
time
on
each
occasion
the
parties
slept
out
at
and
started
from
a
considerable
elevation
and
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
final
peak
of
the
ecrins
early
in
the
day
and
with
plenty
of
superfluous
energy
guides
and
travellers
alike
on
each
occasion
were
exceptional
men
experienced
mountaineers
who
had
proved
their
skill
and
courage
on
numerous
antecedent
occasions
and
who
were
not
accustomed
to
turn
away
from
a
thing
merely
because
it
was
difficult
on
each
occasion
the
attempts
were
abandoned
because
the
state
of
the
snow
on
and
below
the
final
peak
was
such
that
avalanches
were
anticipated
and
according
to
the
judgment
of
those
who
were
concerned
there
was
such
an
amount
of
positive
danger
from
this
condition
of
things
that
it
was
unjustifiable
to
persevere
we
learnt
privately
from
mathews
bonney
and
tuckett
that
unless
the
snow
was
in
a
good
state
upon
the
final
peak
that
is
to
say
coherent
and
stable
we
should
probably
be
of
the
same
opinion
as
themselves
and
that
although
the
face
of
the
mountain
fronting
the
glacier
de
l
encula
was
much
less
steep
than
its
other
faces
and
was
apparently
the
side
upon
which
an
attempt
was
at
all
likely
to
be
successful
it
was
nevertheless
so
steep
that
for
several
days
at
least
after
a
fall
of
snow
upon
it
the
chances
in
favour
of
avalanches
would
be
considerable
the
reader
need
scarcely
be
told
after
all
that
has
been
said
about
the
variableness
of
weather
in
the
high
alps
the
chance
was
small
indeed
that
we
should
find
upon
the
of
june
or
any
other
set
day
the
precise
condition
of
affairs
that
was
deemed
indispensable
for
success
we
had
such
confidence
in
the
judgment
of
our
friends
that
it
was
understood
amongst
us
the
ascent
should
be
abandoned
unless
the
conditions
were
manifestly
favourable
illustration
the

ecrins
from
the
col
du
galibier
by
five
minutes
to
six
we
were
at
the
top
of
the
gully
a
couloir
about
feet
high
and
within
sight
of
our
work
hard
thin
and
as
the
ecrins
had
looked
from
afar
it
had
never
looked
so
hard
and
so
thin
as
it
did
when
we
emerged
from
the
top
of
the
couloir
through
the
gap
in
the
ridge
no
tender
shadows
spoke
of
broad
and
rounded
ridges
but
sharp
and
shadowless

serrated
edges
stood
out
against
the
clear
sky
it
had
been
said
that
the
route
must
be
taken
by
one
of
the
ridges
of
the
final
peak
but
both
were
alike
repellent
hacked
and
notched
in
numberless
places
they
reminded
me
of
my
failure
on
the
dent
d
h√©rens
in
and
of
a
place
on
a
similar
ridge
from
which
advance
or
retreat
was
alike
difficult
but
presuming
one
or
other
of
these
ridges
or
ar√™tes
was
practicable
there
remained
the
task
of
getting
to
them

base

the
final
peak
swept
an
enormous
bergschrund
almost
separating
it
from
the
slopes
which
lay
beneath
it
was
evident
thus
early
that
the
ascent
would
not
be
accomplished
without
exertion
and
that
it
would
demand
all
our
faculties
and
all
our
time
in
more
than
one
respect
we
were
favoured
the
mists
were
gone
the
day
was
bright
and
perfectly
calm
there
had
been
a
long
stretch
of
fine
weather
beforehand
and
the
snow
was
in
excellent
order
and
most
important
of
all
the
last
new
snow
which
had
fallen
on
the
final
peak
unable
to
support
itself
had
broken
away

avalanche

and
filling
the

down
to
the
summit
of
the
col
des
ecrins
where
it
lay
in
huge
jammed
masses
powerless
to
harm
us
and
had
made
a
broad
track
almost
a
road
over
which
for
part
of
the
way
at
least
we
might
advance
with
rapidity
we
took
in
all
this
in
a
few
minutes
and
seeing
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
despatched
a
hasty
meal
left

and
all
incumbrances
by

again

and
made
direct
for

it

there

was
practicable

to

of
the
bergschrund
at
illustration
outline
to
show
route
up
pointe
des
ecrins
thus
far
there
was
no
trouble
but
the
nature
of
the
work
changed
immediately
if
we
regard
the
upper
feet
alone
of
the
final
peak
of
the
ecrins
it
may
be
described
as
a
pyramid
one
face
is
towards
the
glacier
noir
and
forms
one
of
the
sheerest
precipices
in
the
alps
another
is
towards
the
glacier
du
vallon
and
is
less
steep
and
less
uniform
in
angle
than
the
first
the
third
is
towards
the
glacier
de
l
encula
and
it
was
by
this
one
we
approached
the
summit

a
triangular
plane
or
feet
high
set
at
an
angle
exceeding
let
it
be
smooth
glassy
let
the
uppermost
edges
be
cut
into
spikes
and
teeth
and
let
them
be
bent
some
one
way
some
another
let
the
glassy
face
be
covered
with
minute
fragments
of
rock
scarcely
attached
but
varnished
with
ice
imagine
this
and
then
you
will
have
a
very
faint
idea
of
the
face
of
the
ecrins
on
which
we
stood
it
was
not
possible
to
avoid
detaching
stones
which
as
they
fell
cause
words
unmentionable
to
rise
the
greatest
friends
would
have
reviled
each
other
in
such
a
situation
we
gained
the
eastern
ar√™te
and
endeavoured
for
to
work
upwards
towards
the
summit
but
it
was
useless
each
yard
of
progress
cost
an
incredible
time
and
having
no
desire
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
the
glacier
noir
in
a
precipitate
manner
we
beat
a
retreat
and
returned
to
the
schrund
we
again
held
a
council
and
it
was
unanimously
decided
that
we
should
be
beaten
if
we
could
not
cut
along
the
upper
edge
of
the
schrund
and
when
nearly
beneath
the
summit
work
up
to
it
so
croz
took
off
his
coat
and
went
to
work
ice
that
black
ice
so
often
mentioned
and
so
seldom
seen
but
on
ice
as
hard
as
ice
could
be
weary
work
for
the
guides
croz
cut
for
more
than
and
we
did
not
seem
to
have
advanced
at
all
some
one
behind
seeing
how
great
the
labour
was
and
how
slow
the
progress
suggested
that
after
all
we
might
do
better
on
the
ar√™te
croz
s
blood
was
up
and
indignant
at
this
slight
on
his
powers
he
ceased
working
turned
in
his
steps
and
rushed
towards
me
with
a
haste
that
made
me
shudder
by
all
means
let
us
go
there
the
sooner
the
no
slight
was
intended
and
he
resumed
his
work
after
a
time
being
relieved
by
almer
ten
came
an
hour
had
passed
they
were
still
cutting
dreary
work
for
us
for
no
capering
about
could
be
done
here
hand
as
well
as
foot
holes
were
necessary
the
fingers
and
toes
got
very
cold
the
ice
as
it
boomed
in
bounding
down
the
bergschrund
was
very
suggestive
conversation
was
very
restricted
separated
as
we
were
by
our
tether
of
feet
apiece
another
hour
passed
we
were
now
almost
immediately
below
the
summit
and
we
stopped
to
look
up
we
were
nearly
as
far
off
it
vertically
as
we
had
been
more
than
three
hours
before
the
day
seemed
going
against
us
the
only
rocks
near
at
hand
were
scattered
no
bigger
than
and
most
of
these
we
found
afterwards
were
glazed
with
ice
time
forbade
cutting
right
up
to
the
summit
even
had
it
been
possible
which
it
was
not
we
decided
to
go
up
to
the
ridge
again
by
means
of
the
rocks
but
had
we
not
had
a
certain
confidence
in
each
other
it
unquestionably
would
not
have
been
done
for
this
it
must
be
understood
was
a
situation
where
not
only
a
slip
have
been
fatal
to
every
one
but
it
would
have
been
so
beyond
doubt
nothing
moreover
was
easier
than
to
make
one
it
was
a
place
where
all
had
to
work
in
unison
where
there
must
be
no
slackening
of
the
rope
and
no
unnecessary
tension
for
another
hour
we
were
in
this
trying
situation
and
at
we
gained
the
ar√™te
again
at
a
much
higher
point
close
to
the
summit
our
men
were
i
am
afraid
worn
out
cutting
up
a
couloir
feet
high
was
not
the
right
sort
of
preparation
for
work
of
this
kind
be
it
so
or
not
we
were
all
glad
to
rest
for
a
short
time
for
we
had
not
sat
down
a
minute
since
leaving
the
col
six
hours
before
almer
however
was
restless
knowing
that
midday
was
past
and
that
much
remained
to
be
accomplished
and
untied
himself
and
commenced
working
towards
the
summit
connecting
the
teeth
of
rock
were
beds
of
snow
and
almer
only
a
few
feet
from
me
was
crossing
the
top
of
one
of
these
when
suddenly
without
a
moment
s
warning
it
broke
away
under
him
and
plunged
down
on
to
the
glacier
as
he
staggered
for
a
second
one
foot
in
the
act
of
stepping
and
the
other
on
the
falling
mass
i
thought
him
lost
but
he
happily
fell
on
to
the
right
side
and
stopped
himself
had
he
taken
the
step
with
his
right
instead
of
the
left
foot
he
would
in
all
probability
have
fallen
several
hundred
feet
without
touching
anything
and
would
not
have
been
arrested
before
reaching
the
glacier
a
vertical
distance
of
at
least
feet
small
ridiculously
small
as
the
distance
was
to
the
summit
we
were
occupied
nearly
another
hour
before
it
was
gained
almer
was
a
few
feet
in
front
and
he
with
characteristic
modesty
hesitated
to
step
on
the
highest
point
and
drew
back
to
allow
us
to
pass
a
cry
was
raised
for
croz
who
had
done
the
chief
part
of
the
work
but
he
declined
the
honour
and
we
marched
on
to
the
top
simultaneously
that
is
to
say
clustered
round
it
a
yard
or
two
below
for
it
was
much
too
small
to
get
upon
according
to
my
custom
i
bagged
a
piece
from
off
the
highest
rock
chlorite
slate
and
i
found
afterwards
that
it
had
a
striking
similarity
to
the
final
peak
of
the
ecrins
i
have
noticed
the
same
thing
on
other
occasions
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
not
only
do
fragments
of
such
rock
as
limestone
often
present
the
characteristic
forms
of
the
cliffs
from
which
they
have
been
broken
but
that
morsels
of
mica
slate
will
represent
in
a
wonderful
manner
the
identical
shape
of
the
peaks
of
which
they
have
formed
part
why
should
it
not
be
so
if
the
mountain
s
mass
is
more
or
less
homogeneous
the
same
causes
which
produce
the
small
forms
fashion
the
large
ones
the
same
influences
are
at
work
the
same
frost
and
rain
give
shape
to
the
mass
as
well
as
to
its
parts
illustration
fragment
from
the
summit
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
did
space
permit
me
i
could
give
a
very
poor
idea
of
the
view
but
it
will
be
readily
imagined
that
a
panorama
extending
over
as
much
ground
as
the
whole
of
england
is
one
worth
taking
some
trouble
to
see
and
one
which
is
not
often
to
be
seen
even
in
the
alps
no
clouds
obscured
it
and
a
list
of
the
summits
that
we
saw
would
include
nearly
all
the
highest
peaks
of
the
chain
i
saw
the
pelvoux
i
had
seen
the
ecrins
from
it
three
years
the
basin
of
the
glacier
noir
it
is
a
splendid
mountain
although
in
height
it
is
equalled
if
not
surpassed
by
its
neighbour
the
al√©froide
we
could
stay
on
the
summit
only
a
short
time
and
at
a
quarter
to
two
prepared
for
the
descent
now
as
we
looked
down
and
thought
of
what
we
had
passed
over
in
coming
up
we
one
and
all
hesitated
about
returning
the
same
way
moore
said
no
walker
said
the
same
and
i
too
the
guides
were
both
of
the
same
mind
this
be
it
remarked
although
we
had
considered
that
there
was
no
chance
whatever
of
getting
up
any
other
way
but
those
last
rocks
were
not
to
be
forgotten
had
they
only
protruded
to
a
moderate
extent
or
had
they
been
merely
glazed
we
should
doubtless
still
have
tried
but
they
were
not
reasonable
rocks
would
neither
allow
us
to
hold
nor
would
do
it
themselves
so
we
turned
to
the
western
ar√™te
trusting
to
luck
that
we
should
find
a
way
down
to
the
schrund
and
some
means
of
getting
over
it
afterwards
our
faces
were
a
tolerable
index
to
our
thoughts
and
apparently
the
thoughts
of
the
party
were
not
happy
ones
had
any
one
then
said
to
me
you
are
a
great
fool
for
coming
here
i
should
have
answered
with
humility
it
is
too
and
had
my
monitor
gone
on
to
say
swear
you
will
never
ascend
another
mountain
if
you
get
down
safely
i
am
inclined
to
think
i
should
have
taken
the
oath
in
fact
the
game
here
was
not
worth
the
risk
the
guides
felt
it
as
well
as
ourselves
and
as
almer
led
off
he
remarked
with
more
piety
than
logic
the
good
god
has
brought
us
up
and
he
will
take
us
down
in
safety
which
showed
pretty
well
what
was
thinking
about
the
ridge
down
which
we
now
endeavoured
to
make
our
way
was
not
inferior
in
difficulty
to
the
other
but
were
serrated
to
an
extent
that
made
it
impossible
to
keep
strictly
to
them
and
obliged
us
to
descend
occasionally
for
some
distance
on
the
northern
face
and
then
mount
again
both
were
so
rotten
that
the
most
experienced
of
our
party
as
well
as
the
least
continually
upset
blocks
large
and
small
both
ar√™tes
were
so
narrow
so
thin
that
it
was
often
a
matter
for
speculation
on
which
side
an
unstable
block
would
fall
at
one
point
it
seemed
that
we
should
be
obliged
to
return
to
the
summit
and
try
the
other
way
down
we
were
on
the
very
edge
of
the
ar√™te
on
one
side
was
the
enormous
precipice
facing
the
pelvoux
which
is
not
far
from
perpendicular
on
the
other
a
slope
exceeding
a
deep
notch
brought
us
to
an
abrupt
halt
almer
who
was
leading
advanced
cautiously
to
the
edge
on
hands
and
knees
and
peered
over
his
care
was
by
no
means
unnecessary
for
the
rocks
had
broken
away
from
under
us
unexpectedly
several
times
in
this
position
he
gazed
down
for
some
moments
and
then
without
a
word
turned
his
head
and
looked
at
us
his
face
have
expressed
apprehension
or
alarm
but
it
certainly
did
not
show
hope
or
joy
we
learned
that
there
was
no
means
of
getting
down
and
that
we
must
if
we
wanted
to
pass
the
notch
jump
across
on
to
an
unstable
block
on
the
other
side
it
was
decided
that
it
should
be
done
and
almer
with
a
larger
extent
of
rope
than
usual
jumped
the
rock
swayed
as
he
came
down
upon
it
but
he
clutched
a
large
mass
with
both
arms
and
brought
himself
to
anchor
that
which
was
both
difficult
and
dangerous
for
the
first
man
was
easy
enough
for
the
others
and
we
got
across
with
less
trouble
than
i
expected
stimulated
by
croz
s
perfectly
just
observation
that
if
we
couldn
t
get
across
there
we
were
not
likely
to
get
down
the
other
way
we
had
now
arrived
at
and
could
no
longer
continue
on
the
ar√™te
so
we
commenced
descending
the
face
again
before
long
we
were
close
to
the
schrund
but
unable
to
see
what
it
was
like
at
this
part
as
the
upper
edge
bent
over
two
hours
had
already
passed
since
leaving
the
summit
and
it
began
to
be
highly
probable
that
we
should
have
to
spend
a
night
on
the
glacier
blanc
almer
who
yet
led
cut
steps
right
down
to
the
edge
but
still
he
could
not
see
below
therefore
warning
us
to
hold
tight
he
made
his
whole
body
rigid
and
standing
in
the
large
step
which
he
had
cut
for
the
purpose
had
the
upper
part
of
his
person
lowered
out
until
he
saw
what
he
wanted
he
shouted
that
our
work
was
finished
made
me
come
close
to
the
edge
and
untie
myself
advanced
the
others
until
he
had
rope
enough
and
then
with
a
loud
jumped
down
on
to
soft
snow
partly
by
skill
and
partly
by
luck
he
had
hit
the
crevasse
at
its
easiest
point
and
we
had
only
to
make
a
downward
jump
of
eight
or
ten
feet
we
had
been
more
than
eight
hours
and
a
half
accomplishing
the
ascent
of
the
final
peak
which
according
to
an
observation
by
bonney
in
is
only
feet
high
during
this
period
we
had
not
stopped
for
more
than
and
our
nerves
and
muscles
had
been
kept
at
the
highest
degree
of
tension
the
whole
time
it
may
be
imagined
that
we
accepted
the
ordinary
conditions
of
glacier
travelling
as
an
agreeable
relief
and
that
that
which
at
another
time
might
have
seemed
formidable
we
treated
as
the
veriest
bagatelle
late
in
the
day
as
it
was
and
soft
as
was
the
snow
we
put
on
such
pace
that
we
reached
the
col
des
ecrins
in
less
than
forty
minutes
we
lost
no
time
in
arranging
our
baggage
for
we
had
still
to
traverse
a
long
glacier
and
to
get
clear
of
two
before
it
was
dark
so
at
we
resumed
the
march
adjourning
eating
and
drinking
and
put
on
a
spurt
which
took
us
clear
of
the
glacier
blanc
by
we
got
off
the
moraine
of
the
glacier
noir
at
just
as
the
last
remnant
of
daylight
vanished
croz
and
myself
were
a
trifle
in
advance
of
the
others
and
fortunately
so
for
us
for
as
they
were
about
to
commence
the
descent
of
the
snout
of
the
glacier
the
whole
of
the
moraine
that
rested
on
its
face
peeled
off
and
came
down
with
a
tremendous
roar
we
had
now
the
pleasure
of
walking
over
a
plain
that
is
known
by
the
name
of
the
pr√©
de
madame
carle
covered
with
pebbles
of
all
sizes
and
intersected
by
numerous
small
streams
or
torrents
every
hole
looked
like
a
stone
every
stone
like
a
hole
and
we
tumbled
about
from
side
to
side
until
our
limbs
and
our
tempers
became
thoroughly
jaded
my
companions
being
both
found
the
travelling
especially
disagreeable
so
there
was
little
wonder
that
when
we
came
upon
a
huge
mass
of
rock
as
big
as
a
house
which
had
fallen
from
the
flanks
of
pelvoux
a
regular
cube
that
offered
no
shelter
whatever
moore
cried
out
in
ecstasy
oh
how
delightful
the
very
thing
i
have
been
longing
for
let
us
have
a
perfectly
extemporaneous
this
it
should
be
said
was
when
the
night
threatened
thunder
and
lightning
rain
and
all
other
delights
the
pleasures
of
a
perfectly
extemporaneous
bivouac
under
these
circumstances
not
being
novelties
to
croz
and
myself
we
thought
we
would
try
for
the
miseries
of
a
roof
but
walker
and
almer
with
their
usual
good
nature
declared
it
was
the
very
thing
that
they
too
were
longing
for
so
the
trio
resolved
to
stop
we
generously
left
them
all
the
provisions
a
dozen
cubic
inches
or
thereabouts
of
bacon
fat
and
half
a
candle
and
pushed
on
for
the
chalets
of
al√©froide
or
at
least
we
thought
we
did
but
could
not
be
certain
in
the
course
of
we
got
uncommonly
close
to
the
main
torrent
and
croz
all
at
once
disappeared
i
stepped
cautiously
forward
to
peer
down
into
the
place
where
i
thought
he
was
and
quietly
tumbled
head
over
heels
into
a
big
rhododendron
bush
extricating
myself
with
some
trouble
i
fell
backwards
over
some
rocks
and
got
wedged
in
a
cleft
so
close
to
the
torrent
that
it
splashed
all
over
me
the
colloquy
which
then
ensued
amid
the
thundering
of
the
stream
was
as
follows
hullo
croz
eh
where
you
here
where
here
i
don
t
know
where
are
here
croz
and
so
on
the
fact
was
from
the
intense
darkness
and
the
noise
of
the
torrent
we
had
no
idea
of
each
other
s
situation
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
however
we
joined
together
again
agreed
we
had
had
quite
enough
of
that
kind
of
thing
and
adjourned
to
a
most
eligible
rock
at
how
well
i
remember
the
night
at
that
rock
and
the
jolly
way
in
which
croz
came
out
we
were
both
very
wet
about
the
legs
and
both
uncommonly
hungry
but
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
round
our
fire
of
juniper
and
until
long
past
midnight
we
sat
up
recounting
over
our
pipes
wonderful
stories
of
the
most
incredible
description
in
which
i
must
admit
my
companion
beat
me
hollow
then
throwing
ourselves
on
our
beds
of
rhododendron
we
slept
an
untroubled
sleep
and
rose
on
a
bright
sunday
morning
as
fresh
as
might
be
intending
to
enjoy
a
day
s
rest
and
luxury
with
our
friends
at
la

val
louise
illustration
a
night
with
croz
i
have
failed
to
give
the
impression
i
wish
if
it
has
not
been
made
evident
that
the
ascent
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
was
not
an
ordinary
piece
of
work
there
is
an
increasing
disposition
amongst
those
who
write
on
the
alps
to
underrate
the
difficulties
and
dangers
which
are
met
with
and
this
disposition
is
i
think
not
less
mischievous
than
the
style
of
making
everything
terrible
difficult
as
we
found
the
peak
i
believe
we
took
it
at
the
best
perhaps
the
only
possible
time
of
the
year
the
great
slope
on
which
we
spent
so
much
time
was
from
being
denuded
by
the
avalanche
of
which
i
have
spoken
deprived
of
its
greatest
danger
had
it
had
the
snow
still
resting
upon
it
and
had
we
persevered
with
the
expedition
we
should
almost
without
doubt
have
ended
with
calamity
instead
of
success
the
ice
of
that
slope
is
always
below
its
angle
is
severe
and
the
rocks
do
not
project
sufficiently
to
afford
the
support
that
snow
requires
to
be
stable
when
at
a
great
angle
so
far
am
i
from
desiring
to
tempt
any
one
to
repeat
the
expedition
that
i
put
it
on
record
as
my
belief
however
sad
and
however
miserable
a
man
may
have
been
if
he
is
found
on
the
summit
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
after
a
fall
of
new
snow
he
is
likely
to
experience
misery
far
deeper
than
anything
with
which
he
has
hitherto
been
acquainted

how
pleasant
it
is
for
him
who
is
saved
to
remember
his
euripides
from
ailefroide
to
claux
but
for
the
path
travel
would
be
scarcely
more
easy
than
over
the
pr√©
de
madame
carle
the
valley
is
strewn
with
immense
masses
of
gneiss
from
the
size
of
a
large
house
downwards
and
it
is
only
occasionally
that
rock
is
seen
so
covered
up
is
it
by
the
d√©bris
which
seems
to
have
been
derived
almost
entirely
from
the
neighbouring
cliffs
it
was
sunday
a
day
most
calm
and
golden
sunlight
had
dispersed
the
clouds
and
was
glorifying
the
heights
and
we
forgot
hunger
through
the
brilliancy
of
the
morning
and
beauty
of
the
mountains
we
meant
the
to
be
a
day
of
rest
but
it
was
little
that
we
found
in
the
of
claude
giraud
and
we
fled
before
the
babel
of
sound
which
rose
in
intensity
as
men
descended
to
a
depth
which
is
unattainable
by
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
found
at
the
chalets
of
entraigues
the
peace
that
had
been
denied
to
us
at
val
louise
again
we
were
received
with
the
most
cordial
hospitality
everything
that
was
eatable
or
drinkable
was
brought
out
and
pressed
upon
us
every
little
curiosity
was
exhibited
every
information
that
could
be
afforded
was
given
and
when
we
retired
to
our
clean
straw
we
again
congratulated
each
other
that
we
had
escaped
from
the
foul
den
which
is
where
a
good
inn
should
be
and
had
cast
in
our
lot
with
those
who
dwell
in
chalets
very
luxurious
that
straw
seemed
after
two
nights
upon
quartz
pebbles
and
glacier
mud
and
i
felt
quite
aggrieved
expecting
it
was
the
summons
for
departure
when
about
midnight
the
heavy
wooden
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
and
a
man
hem
d
and
ha
d
to
attract
attention
but
when
it
whispered
monsieur
edvard
i
perceived
my
mistake
was
our
pelvoux
companion
monsieur
reynaud
the
excellent
of
la
bess√©e
monsieur
reynaud
had
been
invited
to
accompany
us
on
the
excursion
that
is
described
in
this
chapter
but
had
arrived
at
val
louise
after
we
had
left
and
had
energetically
pursued
us
during
the
night
our
idea
was
that
a
pass
might
be
made
over
the
high
ridge
called
on
the
french
map
cr√™te
de
b≈ìufs
rouges
near
to
the
peak
named
les
bans
and
that
it
might
be
the
shortest
route
in
time
as
it
certainly
would
be
in
distance
from
val
louise
across
the
central
dauphin√©
alps
we
had
seen
the
northern
or
pilatte
side
from
the
br√®che
de

and
it
seemed
to
be
practicable
at
one
place
near
the
mountain
more
than
that
could
not
be
told
at
a
distance
of
eleven
miles
we
intended
to
try
to
hit
a
point
on
the
ridge
immediately
above
the
part
where
it
seemed
to
be
easiest
we
left
entraigues
at
on
the
morning
of
june
and
proceeded
over
very
ground
towards
the
foot
of
the
pic
de
bonvoisin
following
in
fact
the
route
of
the
col
de
sellar
which
leads
from
the
val
louise
into
the
val
godemar
and
at
finding
that
there
was
no
chance
of
obtaining
a
view
from
the
bottom
of
the
valley
of
the
ridge
over
which
our
route
was
to
be
taken
sent
almer
up
the
lower
slopes
of
the
bonvoisin
to
reconnoitre
he
telegraphed
that
we
might
proceed
and
at
we
quitted
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
for
the
slopes
which
rose
towards
the
north
the
course
was
and
was
prodigiously
steep
less
than
two
miles
difference
of
latitude
we
rose
one
mile
of
absolute
but
the
route
was
so
far
from
being
an
exceptionally
difficult
one
that
at
we
stood
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
having
made
an
ascent
of
more
than
feet
in
five
hours
inclusive
of
halts
upon
sheet
of
the
french
map
a
glacier
is
laid
down
on
the
south
of
the
cr√™te
des
b≈ìufs
rouges
extending
along
the
entire
length
of
the
ridge
at
its
foot
from
east
to
west
in
this
glacier
did
not
exist
as
glacier
but
in
the
place
where
it
should
have
been
there
were
several
small
ones
all
of
which
were
i
believe
separated
from
each
other
we
commenced
the
ascent
from
the
val
d
entraigues
to
the
west
of
the
most
western
of
these
small
glaciers
and
quitted
the
valley
by
the
first
great
gap
in
its
cliffs
after
that
glacier
was
passed
we
did
not
take
to
the
ice
until
it
afforded
an
easier
route
than
the
rocks
then
croz
went
to
the
front
and
led
with
admirable
skill
through
a
maze
of
crevasses
up
to
the
foot
of
a
great
snow
that
rose
from
the
head
of
the
glacier
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
over
which
we
had
to
pass
we
had
settled
beforehand
in
london
without
knowing
anything
whatever
about
the
place
that
such
a
couloir
as
this
should
be
in
this
angle
but
when
we
got
into
the
val
d
entraigues
and
found
that
it
was
not
possible
to
see
into
the
corner
our
faith
in
its
existence
became
less
and
less
until
the
telegraphing
of
almer
who
was
sent
up
the
opposite
slopes
to
search
for
it
assured
us
that
we
were
true
prophets
illustration
a
snow
couloir
snow
are
nothing
more
or
less
than
gullies
partly
filled
by
snow
they
are
most
useful
institutions
and
may
be
considered
as
natural
highways
placed
by
a
kind
providence
in
convenient
situations
for
getting
over
places
which
would
otherwise
be
inaccessible
they
are
a
joy
to
the
mountaineer
and
from
afar
assure
him
of
a
path
when
all
beside
is
uncertain
but
they
are
grief
to
novices
who
when
upon
steep
snow
are
usually
seized
with
two
that
the
snow
will
slip
and
secondly
that
those
who
are
upon
it
must
slip
too
nothing
perhaps
could
look
much
more
unpromising
to
those
who
do
not
know
the
virtues
of
couloirs
than
such
a
place
as
the
engraving
represents
and
if
persons
inexperienced
in
mountain
craft
had
occasion
to
cross
a
ridge
or
to
climb
rocks
in
which
there
were
such
couloirs
they
would
instinctively
avoid
them
but
practised
mountaineers
would
naturally
look
to
them
for
a
path
and
would
follow
them
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
unless
they
turned
out
to
be
filled
with
ice
or
too
much
swept
by
falling
stones
or
the
rock
at
the
sides
proved
to
be
of
such
an
exceptional
character
as
to
afford
an
easier
path
than
the
snow
couloirs
look
prodigiously
steep
when
seen
from
the
front
and
so
viewed
it
is
impossible
to
be
certain
of
their
inclination
within
many
degrees
snow
however
does
actually
lie
at
steeper
angles
in
couloirs
than
in
any
other
situations
to
degrees
is
not
an
uncommon
inclination
even
at
such
angles
two
men
with
proper
axes
can
mount
on
snow
at
the
rate
of
to
feet
per
hour
the
same
amount
can
only
be
accomplished
in
the
same
time
on
steep
rocks
when
they
are
of
the
very
easiest
character
and
four
or
five
hours
may
be
readily
spent
upon
an
equal
height
of
difficult
rocks
snow
couloirs
are
therefore
to
be
commended
because
they
economise
time
of
course
in
all
gullies
one
is
liable
to
be
encountered
by
falling
stones
most
of
those
which
fall
from
the
rocks
of
a
couloir
sooner
or
later
spin
down
the
snow
which
fills
the
trough
and
as
their
course
and
pace
are
more
clearly
apparent
when
falling
over
snow
than
when
jumping
from
ledge
to
ledge
persons
with
lively
imaginations
are
readily
impressed
by
them
the
grooves
which
are
usually
seen
wandering
down
the
length
of
snow
couloirs
are
deepened
and
perhaps
occasionally
originated
by
falling
stones
and
they
are
sometimes
pointed
out
by
cautious
men
as
reasons
why
couloirs
should
not
be
followed
i
think
they
are
very
frequently
only
gutters
caused
by
water
trickling
off
the
rocks
whether
this
is
so
or
not
one
should
always
consider
the
possibility
of
being
struck
by
falling
stones
and
in
order
to
lessen
the
risk
as
far
as
possible
should
mount
upon
the
sides
of
the
snow
and
not
up
its
centre
stones
that
come
off
the
rocks
will
then
generally
fly
over
one
s
head
or
bound
down
the
middle
of
the
trough
at
a
safe
distance
at
we
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
couloir
leading
from
the
nameless
glacier
to
a
point
in
the
ridge
just
to
the
east
of
mont
bans
so
far
the
route
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
steep
grind
in
an
angle
where
little
could
be
seen
but
now
views
opened
out
in
several
directions
and
the
way
began
to
be
interesting
it
was
more
so
perhaps
to
us
than
to
our
companion
reynaud
who
had
no
rest
in
the
last
night
he
was
moreover
heavily
laden
science
was
to
be
pockets
were
stuffed
with
books
heights
and
angles
were
to
be
knapsack
was
filled
with
instruments
hunger
was
to
be
guarded
shoulders
were
ornamented
with
a
huge
nimbus
of
bread
and
a
leg
of
mutton
swung
behind
from
his
knapsack
looking
like
an
overgrown
tail
being
a
fellow
he
had
brought
this
food
thinking
we
might
be
in
need
of
it
as
it
happened
we
were
well
provided
for
and
having
our
own
packs
to
carry
could
not
relieve
him
of
his
superfluous
burdens
which
naturally
he
did
not
like
to
throw
away
as
the
angles
steepened
the
strain
on
his
strength
became
more
and
more
apparent
at
last
he
began
to
groan
at
first
a
most
gentle
and
mellow
groan
but
as
we
rose
so
did
his
groans
till
at
last
the
cliffs
were
groaning
in
echo
and
we
were
moved
to
laughter
croz
cut
the
way
with
unflagging
energy
throughout
the
whole
of
the
ascent
and
at
we
stood
on
the
summit
of
our
pass
intending
to
refresh
ourselves
with
a
good
halt
unhappily
at
that
moment
a
mist
which
had
been
playing
about
the
ridge
swooped
down
and
blotted
out
the
whole
of
the
view
on
the
northern
side
croz
was
the
only
one
who
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
descent
and
it
was
deemed
advisable
to
push
on
immediately
while
its
recollection
was
fresh
in
his
memory
we
are
consequently
unable
to
tell
anything
about
the
summit
of
the
pass
except
that
it
lies
immediately
to
the
east
of
mont
bans
and
is
elevated
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
it
is
the
highest
pass
in
dauphin√©
we
called
it
the
col
de
pilatte
we
commenced
to
descend
towards
the
glacier
de
pilatte
by
a
slope
of
smooth
ice
the
face
of
which
according
to
the
measurement
of
moore
had
an
inclination
of
croz
still
led
and
the
others
followed
at
intervals
of
about
feet
all
being
tied
together
and
almer
occupying
the
responsible
position
of
last
man
the
two
guides
were
therefore
about
feet
apart
they
were
quite
invisible
to
each
other
from
the
mist
and
looked
spectral
even
to
us
but
the
man
could
be
heard
by
all
hewing
out
the
steps
below
while
every
now
and
then
the
voice
of
the
man
pierced
the
cloud
slip
not
dear
sirs
place
well
your
feet
stir
not
until
you
are
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
we
progressed
in
this
fashion
the
axe
of
croz
all
at
once
stopped
what
is
the
matter
croz
bergschrund
can
we
get
over
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
i
think
we
must
the
clouds
rolled
away
right
and
left
as
he
spoke
the
effect
was
dramatic
it
was
a
de
preparatory
to
the
great
sensation
leap
which
was
about
to
be
executed
by
the
entire
company
some
unseen
cause
some
cliff
or
obstruction
in
the
rocks
underneath
had
caused
our
wall
of
ice
to
split
into
two
portions
and
the
huge
fissure
which
had
thus
been
formed
extended
on
each
hand
as
far
as
could
be
seen
we
on
the
slope
above
were
separated
from
the
slope
below
by
a
mighty
crevasse
no
running
up
and
down
to
look
for
an
easier
place
to
cross
could
be
done
on
an
of
the
chasm
had
to
be
passed
then
and
there
a
downward
jump
of
or
feet
and
a
forward
leap
of
or
feet
had
to
be
made
at
the
same
time
that
is
not
much
you
will
say
it
was
not
much
it
was
not
the
quantity
but
it
was
the
quality
of
the
jump
which
gave
to
it
its
particular
flavour
you
had
to
hit
a
narrow
ridge
of
ice
if
that
was
passed
it
seemed
as
if
you
might
roll
down
for
ever
and
ever
if
it
was
not
attained
you
dropped
into
the
crevasse
below
which
although
partly
choked
by
icicles
and
snow
that
had
fallen
from
above
was
still
gaping
in
many
places
ready
to
receive
an
erratic
body
croz
untied
walker
in
order
to
get
rope
enough
and
warning
us
to
hold
fast
sprang
over
the
chasm
he
alighted
cleverly
on
his
feet
untied
himself
and
sent
up
the
rope
to
walker
who
followed
his
example
it
was
then
my
turn
and
i
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
ice
the
second
which
followed
was
what
is
called
a
supreme
moment
that
is
to
say
i
felt
supremely
ridiculous
the
world
seemed
to
revolve
at
a
frightful
pace
and
my
stomach
to
fly
away
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
sprawling
in
the
snow
and
then
of
course
vowed
that
was
and
prepared
to
encourage
my
friend
reynaud
he
came
to
the
edge
and
made
declarations
i
do
not
believe
that
he
was
a
whit
more
reluctant
to
pass
the
place
than
we
others
but
he
was
infinitely
more
demonstrative
a
word
he
was
french
he
wrung
his
hands
oh
what
a
of
a
place
it
is
nothing
reynaud
i
said
it
is
jump
cried
the
others
but
he
turned
round
as
far
as
one
can
do
such
a
thing
in
an
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
ejaculating
upon
my
word
it
is
not
possible
no
no
no
it
is
not
how
he
came
over
i
do
not
know
we
saw
a
seemed
to
belong
to
moore
we
saw
reynaud
a
flying
body
coming
down
as
if
taking
a
header
into
water
with
arms
and
legs
all
abroad
his
leg
of
mutton
flying
in
the
air
his
b√¢ton
escaped
from
his
grasp
and
then
we
heard
a
thud
as
if
a
bundle
of
carpets
had
been
pitched
out
of
a
window
when
set
upon
his
feet
he
was
a
sorry
spectacle
his
head
was
a
great
snowball
brandy
was
trickling
out
of
one
side
of
the
knapsack
chartreuse
out
of
the
bemoaned
its
loss
but
we
roared
with
laughter
this
chapter
has
already
passed
the
limits
within
which
it
should
have
been
confined
but
i
can
not
close
it
without
paying
tribute
to
the
ability
with
which
croz
led
us
through
a
dense
mist
down
the
remainder
of
the
glacier
de
pilatte
as
an
exhibition
of
strength
and
skill
it
has
probably
never
been
surpassed
in
the
alps
or
elsewhere
on
this
almost
unknown
and
very
steep
glacier
he
was
perfectly
at
home
even
in
the
mists
never
able
to
see
fifty
feet
ahead
he
still
went
on
with
the
utmost
certainty
and
without
having
to
retrace
a
single
step
and
displayed
from
first
to
last
consummate
knowledge
of
the
materials
with
which
he
was
dealing
now
he
cut
steps
down
one
side
of
a
went
with
a
dash
at
the
other
side
and
hauled
us
up
after
him
then
cut
away
along
a
ridge
until
a
point
was
gained
from
which
we
could
jump
on
to
another
ridge
then
doubling
back
found
a
across
which
he
crawled
on
hands
and
knees
towed
us
across
by
the
legs
ridiculing
our
apprehensions
mimicking
our
awkwardness
declining
all
help
bidding
us
only
to
follow
him
about
we
emerged
from
the
mist
and
found
ourselves
just
arrived
upon
the
level
portion
of
the
glacier
having
as
reynaud
properly
remarked
come
down
as
quickly
as
if
there
had
not
been
any
mist
at
all
then
we
attacked
the
leg
of
mutton
which
my
friend
had
so
thoughtfully
brought
with
him
and
afterwards
raced
down
with
renewed
energy
to
la
b√©rarde
reynaud
and
i
walked
together
to
christophe
where
we
parted
since
then
we
have
talked
over
the
doings
of
this
momentous
day
and
i
know
that
he
would
not
for
a
good
deal
have
missed
the
passage
of
the
col
de
pilatte
although
we
failed
to
make
it
an
easier
or
a
shorter
route
than
the
col
du
sel√©
i
rejoined
moore
and
walker
the
same
evening
at
venos
and
on
the
next
day
went
with
them
over
the
lautaret
road
to
the
hospice
on
its
summit
where
we
slept
so
our
little
campaign
in
dauphin√©
came
to
an
end
it
was
remarkable
for
the
absence
of
failures
and
for
the
ease
and
precision
with
which
all
our
plans
were
carried
out
this
was
due
very
much
to
the
spirit
of
my
companions
but
it
was
also
owing
to
the
fine
weather
which
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
enjoy
and
to
our
making
a
very
early
start
every
morning
by
beginning
our
work
at
or
before
the
break
of
day
on
the
longest
days
in
the
year
we
were
not
only
able
to
avoid
hurrying
when
deliberation
was
desirable
but
could
afford
to
spend
several
hours
in
delightful
ease
whenever
the
fancy
seized
us
i
can
not
too
strongly
recommend
to
tourists
in
search
of
amusement
to
avoid
the
inns
of
dauphin√©
sleep
in
the
chalets
get
what
food
you
can
from
the
inns
but
do
not
as
a
rule
attempt
to
pass
nights
in
them
in
them
you
can
not
joanne
says
that
the
inventor
of
the
insecticide
powder
was
a
native
of
dauphin√©
i
can
well
believe
it
he
must
have
often
felt
the
necessity
of
such
an
invention
in
his
infancy
and
childhood
on

a
few
years
ago
not
many
persons
knew
from
personal
knowledge
how
extremely
inaccurately
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
was
delineated
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
century
thousands
had
made
the
tour
of
the
chain
and
before
the
year
at
least
thousand
individuals
had
stood
upon
its
highest
summit
but
out
of
all
this
number
there
was
not
one
capable
willing
or
able
to
map
the
mountain
which
until
recently
was
regarded
the
highest
in
europe
many
persons
knew
that
great
blunders
had
been
perpetrated
and
it
was
notorious
that
even
mont
blanc
itself
was
represented
in
a
ludicrously
incorrect
manner
on
all
sides
excepting
the
north
but
there
was
not
perhaps
a
single
individual
who
knew
at
the
time
to
which
i
refer
that
errors
of
no
less
than
feet
had
been
committed
in
the
determination
of
heights
at
each
end
of
the
chain
that
some
glaciers
were
represented
of
double
their
real
dimensions
and
that
ridges
and
mountains
were
laid
down
which
actually
had
no
existence
one
portion
alone
of
the
entire
chain
had
been
surveyed
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
with
anything
like
accuracy
it
was
not
done
as
one
would
have
expected
by
a
government
but
by
a
private
individual
the
british
de
saussure
late
forbes
in
the
year
he
made
a
special
survey
of
the
mer
de
glace
of
chamounix
and
its
tributaries
which
in
some
of
the
following
years
he
extended
by
further
observations
so
as
to
include
the
glacier
des
the
map
produced
from
this
survey
was
worthy
of
its
author
and
subsequent
explorers
of
the
region
he
investigated
have
been
able
to
detect
only
trivial
inaccuracies
in
his
work
in
sheet
xxii
of
dufour
s
map
of
switzerland
appeared
it
included
the
section
of
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
that
belonged
to
switzerland
and
this
portion
of
the
sheet
was
executed
with
the
admirable
fidelity
and
thoroughness
which
characterise
the
whole
of
dufour
s
unique
map
the
remainder
of
the
chain
amounting
to
about
of
the
whole
was
laid
down
after
the
work
of
previous
topographers
and
its
wretchedness
was
made
more
apparent
by
contrast
with
the
finished
work
of
the
swiss
surveyors
in
who
had
been
travelling
in
the
alps
during
several
years
resolved
to
attempt
a
survey
of
the
unsurveyed
portions
of
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
he
provided
himself
with
a
good
theodolite
and
starting
from
a
measured
by
forbes
in
the
valley
of
chamounix
determined
the
positions
of
no
less
than
points
the
accuracy
of
his
work
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
after
having
turned
many
corners
and
carried
his
observations
over
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
his
col
ferret
fell
within
yards
of
the
position
assigned
to
it
by
general
dufour
in
the
winter
of
and
the
spring
of
reilly
constructed
an
entirely
original
map
from
his
data
the
spaces
between
his
trigonometrically
determined
points
he
filled
in
after
photographs
and
a
series
of
panoramic
sketches
which
he
made
from
his
different
stations
the
map
so
produced
was
an
immense
advance
upon
those
already
in
existence
and
it
was
the
first
which
exhibited
the
great
peaks
in
their
proper
positions
this
extraordinary
piece
of
work
revealed
reilly
to
me
as
a
man
of
wonderful
determination
and
perseverance
with
very
small
hope
that
my
proposal
would
be
accepted
i
invited
him
to
take
part
in
renewed
attacks
on
the
matterhorn
he
entered
heartily
into
my
plans
and
met
me
with
a
namely
that
i
should
accompany
him
on
some
expeditions
which
he
had
projected
in
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
the
unwritten
contract
took
this
form
will
help
you
to
carry
out
your
desires
and
you
shall
assist
me
to
carry
out
mine
i
eagerly
closed
with
an
arrangement
in
which
all
the
advantages
were
upon
my
side
at
the
time
that
reilly
was
carrying
on
his
survey
captain
mieulet
was
executing
another
in
continuation
of
the
great
map
of

for
about
of
the
chain
of

including
the
whole
of

recently
become
french
once
more
captain
mieulet
was
directed
to
survey
up
to
his
frontier
only
and
the
sheet
which
was
destined
to
include
his
work
was
to
be
engraved
of
course
upon
the
scale
of
the
rest
of
the
map
of
nature
but
upon
representations
being
made
at
that
it
would
be
of
great
advantage
to
extend
the
survey
as
far
as
courmayeur
captain
mieulet
was
directed
to
continue
his
observations
into
the
south
or
italian
side
of
the
chain
a
special
sheet
on
the
scale
of
was
promptly
engraved
from
the
materials
he
accumulated
and
was
published
in
by
order
of
the
late
minister
of
war
marshal
randon
this
sheet
was
admirably
executed
but
it
included
the
central
portion
of
the
chain
only
and
a
complete
map
was
still
wanting
reilly
presented
his
map
to
the
english
alpine
club
it
was
resolved
that
it
should
be
published
but
before
it
passed
into
the
engraver
s
hands
its
author
undertook
to
revise
it
carefully
to
this
end
he
planned
a
number
of
expeditions
to
high
points
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
regarded
inaccessible
and
upon
some
of
these
ascents
he
invited
me
to
accompany
him
before
i
pass
on
to
these
expeditions
it
will
be
convenient
to
devote
a
few
lines
to
the
topography
of
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
at
the
present
time
the
chain
is
divided
betwixt
france
switzerland
and
italy
france
has
the
lion
s
share
switzerland
the
most
fertile
portion
and
italy
the
steepest
side
it
has
acquired
a
reputation
which
is
not
extraordinary
but
which
is
not
wholly
merited
it
has
neither
the
beauty
of
the
oberland
nor
the
sublimity
of
dauphin√©
it
attracts
the
vulgar
by
the
possession
of
the
highest
summit
in
the
alps
if
that
is
removed
the
elevation
of
the
chain
is
in
nowise
remarkable
in
fact
excluding
mont
blanc
itself
the
mountains
of
which
the
chain
is
made
up
are
less
important
than
those
of

the
ascent
of
mont

has
been
made
from
several
directions
besides
these
and
perhaps
there
is
no
single
point
of
the
compass
from
which
the
mountain
can
not
be
ascended
but
there
is
not
the
least
probability
that
any
one
will
discover
easier
ways
to
the
summit
than
those
already
known
i
believe
it
is
correct
to
say
that
the
aiguille
du
midi
and
the
aiguille
de
miage
were
the
only
two
summits
in
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
which
had
been
ascended
at
the
beginning
of
the
latter
of
these
two
is
a
perfectly
insignificant
point
and
the
former
is
only
a
portion
of
one
of
the
ridges
just
now
mentioned
and
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
mountain
separate
and
distinct
from
mont
blanc
the
really
great
peaks
of
the
chain
were
considered
inaccessible
and
i
think
with
the
exception
of
the
aiguille
verte
had
never
been
assailed
the
finest
as
well
as
the
highest
peak
in
the
chain
after
mont
blanc
itself
is
the
grandes
jorasses
the
next
without
a
doubt
is
the
aiguille
verte
the
aiguille
de
bionnassay
which
in
actual
height
follows
the
verte
should
be
considered
as
a
part
of
mont
blanc
and
in
the
same
way
the
summit
called
les
droites
is
only
a
part
of
the
ridge
which
culminates
in
the
verte
the
aiguille
de
tr√©lat√™te
is
the
next
on
the
list
that
is
entitled
to
be
considered
a
separate
mountain
and
is
by
far
the
most
important
peak
as
well
as
the
highest
at
the
end
of
the
chain
then
comes
the
aiguille
d
argenti√®re
which
occupies
the
same
rank
at
the
end
as
the
mountain
does
in
the
the
rest
of
the
aiguilles
are
comparatively
insignificant
and
although
some
of
them
such
as
the
mont
dolent
look
well
from
low
elevations
and
seem
to
possess
a
certain
importance
they
sink
into
their
proper
places
directly
one
arrives
at
a
considerable
altitude
the
summit
of
the
aiguille
verte
would
have
been
one
of
the
best
stations
out
of
all
these
mountains
for
the
purposes
of
my
friend
its
great
height
and
its
isolated
and
commanding
position
make
it
a
most
admirable
point
for
viewing
the
intricacies
of
the
chain
but
he
exercised
a
wise
discretion
in
passing
it
by
and
in
selecting
as
our
first
excursion
the
passage
of
the
col
de
triolet
we
slept
under
some
big
rocks
on
the
couvercle
on
the
night
of
july
with
the
thermometer
at
and
at
on
the
made
a
straight
track
to
the
north
of
the
jardin
and
thence
went
in
zigzags
to
break
the
ascent
over
the
upper
slopes
of
the
glacier
de
tal√®fre
towards
the
foot
of
the
aiguille
de
triolet
croz
was
still
my
guide
reilly
was
accompanied
by
one
of
the
michel
payots
of
chamounix
and
henri
charlet
of
the
same
place
was
our
porter
the
way
was
over
an
undulating
plain
of
glacier
of
moderate
inclination
until
the
corner
leading
to
the
col
from
whence
a
steep
secondary
glacier
led
down
into
the
basin
of
the
tal√®fre
we
experienced
no
difficulty
in
making
the
ascent
of
this
secondary
glacier
with
such
as
croz
and
payot
and
at
arrived
on
the
top
of
the
pass
at
a
height
according
to
mieulet
of
feet
and
above
our
camp
on
the
couvercle
the
descent
was
commenced
by
very
steep
but
firm
rocks
and
then
by
a
branch
of
the
glacier
de
triolet
schrunds
were
abundant
there
were
no
less
than
five
extending
completely
across
the
glacier
all
of
which
had
to
be
jumped
not
one
was
equal
in
dimensions
to
the
extraordinary
chasm
on
the
col
de
pilatte
although
in
the
aggregate
they
far
surpassed
it
our
lives
so
reilly
expressed
it
were
made
a
burden
to
us
with
we
flattered
ourselves
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
chalets
of
pr√®
du
bar
very
early
in
the
day
but
owing
to
much
time
being
lost
on
the
slopes
of
mont
rouge
it
was
nearly
before
we
got
to
them
there
were
no
bridges
across
the
torrent
nearer
than
gruetta
and
rather
than
descend
so
far
we
preferred
to
round
the
base
of
mont
rouge
and
to
cross
the
snout
of
the
glacier
du
mont
dolent
we
occupied
the
with
a
scramble
up
mont
dolent
this
was
a
miniature
ascent
it
contained
a
little
of
everything
first
we
went
up
to
the
col
ferret
no
and
had
a
little
grind
over
shaly
banks
then
there
was
a
little
walk
over
grass
then
a
little
tramp
over
a
moraine
which
strange
to
say
gave
a
pleasant
path
then
a
little
zigzagging
over
the
glacier
of
mont
dolent
then
there
was
a
little
bergschrund
then
a
little
wall
of
snow
we
mounted
by
the
side
of
a
little
buttress
and
when
we
struck
the
ridge
descending
from
the
summit
we
found
a
little
ar√™te
of
snow
leading
to
the
highest
point
the
summit
itself
was
little
small
indeed
it
was
the
loveliest
little
cone
of
snow
that
was
ever
piled
up
on
so
soft
so
pure
it
seemed
a
crime
to
defile
it
it
was
a
miniature
jungfrau
a
toy
summit
you
could
cover
it
with
the
hand
but
there
was
nothing
little
about
the
from
the
mont
dolent
situated
at
the
junction
of
three
mountain
ridges
it
rises
in
a
positive
steeple
far
above
anything
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
and
certain
gaps
in
the
surrounding
ridges
which
seem
contrived
for
that
especial
purpose
extend
the
view
in
almost
every
direction
the
precipices
which
descend
to
the
glacier
d
argenti√®re
i
can
only
compare
to
those
of
the
jungfrau
and
the
ridges
on
both
sides
of
that
glacier
especially
the
steep
rocks
of
les
droites
and
les
courtes
surmounted
by
the
sharp
of
the
aig
verte
have
almost
the
effect
of
the
grandes
jorasses
then
framed
as
it
were
between
the
massive
tower
of
the
aig
de
triolet
and
the
more
distant
jorasses
lies
without
exception
the
most
delicately
beautiful
picture
i
have
ever
whole
of
mont
blanc
raising
its
great
head
of
snow
far
above
the
tangled
series
of
flying
buttresses
which
uphold
the
monts
maudits
supported
on
the
left
by
mont
peuteret
and
by
the
mass
of
ragged
aiguilles
which
overhang
the
brenva
this
aspect
of
mont
blanc
is
not
new
but
from
this
point
its
is
unrivalled
and
it
has
all
the
superiority
of
a
picture
grouped
by
the
hand
of
a
master
the
view
is
as
extensive
and
far
more
lovely
than
that
from
mont
blanc
itself
we
went
down
to
courmayeur
and
on
the
afternoon
of
july
started
from
that
place
to
camp
on
mont
suc
for
the
ascent
of
the
aiguille
de
tr√©lat√™te
hopeful
that
the
mists
which
were
hanging
about
would
clear
away
they
did
not
so
we
deposited
ourselves
and
a
vast
load
of
straw
on
the
moraine
of
the
miage
glacier
just
above
the
lac
de
combal
in
a
charming
little
hole
which
some
solitary
shepherd
had
excavated
beneath
a
great
slab
of
rock
we
spent
the
night
there
and
the
whole
of
the
next
day
unwilling
to
run
away
and
equally
so
to
get
into
difficulties
by
venturing
into
the
mist
it
was
a
dull
time
and
i
grew
restless
reilly
read
to
me
a
lecture
on
the
excellence
of
patience
and
composed
himself
in
an
easy
attitude
to
pore
over
the
pages
of
a
book
patience
i
said
to
him
viciously
comes
readily
to
fellows
who
have
shilling
novels
but
i
have
not
got
one
i
have
picked
all
the
mud
out
of
the
nails
of
my
boots
and
have
skinned
my
face
what
shall
i
do
go
and
study
the
moraine
of
the
miage
said
he
i
went
and
came
back
after
an
hour
what
news
cried
reilly
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
very
little
it
s
a
big
moraine
bigger
than
i
thought
with
ridge
outside
ridge
like
a
fortified
camp
and
there
are
walls
upon
it
which
have
been
built
and
as
if
for
try
again
he
said
as
he
threw
himself
on
his
back
but
i
went
to
croz
who
was
asleep
and
tickled
his
nose
with
a
straw
until
he
awoke
and
then
as
that
amusement
was
played
out
watched
reilly
who
was
getting
numbed
and
shifted
uneasily
from
side
to
side
and
threw
himself
on
his
stomach
and
rested
his
head
on
his
elbows
and
lighted
his
pipe
and
puffed
at
it
savagely
when
i
looked
again
how
was
reilly
an
indistinguishable
heap
arms
legs
head
stones
and
straw
all
mixed
together
his
hat
flung
on
one
side
his
novel
tossed
far
away

bah
it
was
a
dull
time
our
mountain
like
a
beautiful
coquette
sometimes
unveiled
herself
for
a
moment
and
looked
charming
above
although
very
mysterious
below
it
was
not
until
eventide
she
allowed
us
to
approach
her
then
as
darkness
came
on
the
curtains
were
withdrawn
the
light
drapery
was
lifted
and
we
stole
up
on
tiptoe
through
the
grand
portal
formed
by
mont
suc
but
night
advanced
rapidly
and
we
found
ourselves
left
out
in
the
cold
without
a
hole
to
creep
into
or
shelter
from
overhanging
rock
we
might
have
fared
badly
except
for
our
good
plaids
when
they
were
sewn
together
down
their
long
edges
and
one
end
tossed
over
our
rope
which
was
passed
round
some
rocks
and
the
other
secured
by
stones
there
was
sufficient
protection
and
we
slept
on
this
exposed
ridge
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
more
soundly
perhaps
than
if
we
had
been
lying
on
feather
beds
illustration
our
camp
on
mont
suc
we
left
our
bivouac
at
and
at
arrived
upon
the
highest
of
the
three
summits
of
the
tr√©lat√™te
by
passing
over
the
lowest
one
it
was
well
above
everything
at
this
end
of
the
chain
and
the
view
from
it
was
extraordinarily
magnificent
the
whole
of
the
western
face
of
mont
blanc
was
spread
out
before
us
we
were
the
first
by
whom
it
had
been
ever
seen
i
cede
the
description
of
this
view
to
my
comrade
to
whom
it
rightfully
belongs
for
four
years
i
had
felt
great
interest
in
the
geography
of
the
chain
the
year
before
i
had
mapped
more
or
less
successfully
all
but
this
spot
and
this
spot
had
always
eluded
my
grasp
the
praises
undeserved
as
they
were
which
my
map
had
received
were
as
gall
and
wormwood
to
me
when
i
thought
of
that
great
slope
which
i
had
been
obliged
to
leave
a
blank
speckled
over
with
unmeaning
dots
of
rock
gathered
from
previous
i
had
consulted
them
all
without
meeting
an
intelligible
representation
of
it
from
the
surface
of
the
miage
glacier
i
had
gained
nothing
for
i
could
only
see
the
feet
of
magnificent
and
no
more
but
now
from
the
top
of
the
dead
wall
of
rock
which
had
so
long
closed
my
view
i
saw
those
fine
glaciers
from
top
to
bottom
pouring
down
their
streams
nearly
as
large
as
the
bossons
from
mont
blanc
from
the
bosse
and
from
the
d√¥me
the
head
of
mont
blanc
is
supported
on
this
side
by
two
buttresses
between
which
vast
glaciers
descend
of
these
the
most
southern
takes
its
rise
at
the
foot
of
the
precipices
which
fall
steeply
down
from
the
calotte
and
its
stream
as
it
joins
that
of
the
miage
is
cut
in
two
by
an
enormous
of
rock
next
to
the
left
comes
the
largest
of
the
buttresses
of
which
i
have
spoken
almost
forming
an
aiguille
in
itself
the
next
glacier
descends
from
a
large
basin
which
receives
the
snows
of
the
between
the
bosse
and
the
dome
and
it
is
divided
from
the
third
and
last
glacier
by
another
buttress
which
joins
the
at
a
point
between
the
d√¥me
and
the
aig
de
bionnassay
the
great
buttresses
betwixt
these
magnificent
have
supplied
a
large
portion
of
the
enormous
masses
of
d√©bris
which
are
disposed
in
ridges
round
about
and
are
strewn
over
the
termination
of
the
glacier
de
miage
in
the
val
v√©ni
these
moraines
used
to
be
classed
amongst
the
wonders
of
the
world
they
are
very
large
for
a
glacier
of
the
size
of
the
miage
the
dimensions
of
moraines
are
not
ruled
by
those
of
glaciers
many
small
glaciers
have
large
moraines
and
many
large
ones
have
small
moraines
the
size
of
the
moraines
of
any
glacier
depends
mainly
upon
the
area
of
rock
surface
that
is
exposed
to
atmospheric
influences
within
the
basin
drained
by
the
glacier
upon
the
nature
of
such
rock
it
is
friable
or
resistant
and
upon
the
dip
of
strata
moraines
most
likely
will
be
small
if
little
rock
surface
is
exposed
but
when
large
ones
are
seen
then
in
all
probability
large
areas
of
rock
uncovered
by
snow
or
ice
will
be
found
in
immediate
contiguity
to
the
glacier
the
miage
glacier
has
large
ones
because
it
receives
detritus
from
many
great
cliffs
and
ridges
but
if
this
glacier
instead
of
lying
as
it
does
at
the
bottom
of
a
trough
were
to
fill
that
trough
if
it
were
to
completely
envelope
the
aiguille
de
tr√©lat√™te
and
the
other
mountains
which
border
it
and
were
to
descend
from
mont
blanc
unbroken
by
rock
or
ridge
it
would
be
as
destitute
of
morainic
matter
as
the
great
de
of
greenland
for
if
a
country
or
district
is
covered
up
by
glacier
the
moraines
may
be
of
the
very
smallest
dimensions
the
contributions
that
are
supplied
to
moraines
by
glaciers
themselves
from
the
abrasion
of
the
rocks
over
which
their
ice
passes
are
minute
compared
with
the
accumulations
which
are
furnished
from
other
sources
these
great
are
formed
one
may
say
almost
entirely
from
d√©bris
which
falls
or
is
washed
down
the
flanks
of
mountains
or
from
cliffs
bordering
glaciers
and
are
composed
to
a
very
limited
extent
only
of
matter
that
is
ground
rasped
or
filed
off
by
the
friction
of
the
ice
if
the
contrary
view
were
to
be
adopted
if
it
could
be
maintained
that
glaciers
their
motion
break
off
masses
of
rock
from
the
sides
and
bottoms
of
their
valley
and
crowd
along
every
thing
that
is
movable
so
as
to
form
large
accumulations
of
d√©bris
in
front
and
along
their
sides
the
conclusion
could
not
be
resisted
the
greater
the
glacier
the
greater
should
be
the
moraine
this
doctrine
does
not
find
much
favour
with
those
who
have
personal
knowledge
of
what
glaciers
do
at
the
present
time
from
de
saussure
downwards
it
has
been
pointed
out
time
after
time
that
moraines
are
chiefly
formed
from
d√©bris
coming
from
rocks
or
soil
the
ice
not
from
the
bed
over
which
it
passes
but
amongst
the
writings
of
modern
speculators
upon
glaciers
and
in
bygone
times
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
the
notions
entertained
that
moraines
represent
the
amount
of
such
is
the
term
employed
performed
by
glaciers
or
at
least
are
comprised
of
matter
which
has
been
excavated
by
glaciers
that
vast
moraines
have
necessarily
been
produced
by
vast
glaciers
and
that
a
great
extension
of
glaciers
necessarily
causes
the
production
of
vast
moraines
such
generalisations
can
not
be
sustained
we
descended
in
our
track
to
the
lac
de
combal
and
from
thence
went
over
the
col
de
la
seigne
to
les
motets
where
we
slept
on
july
crossed
the
col
du

in
a
sharp
thunderstorm
and
the
col
de
voza
to
chamounix
two
days
only
remained
for
excursions
in
this
neighbourhood
and
we
resolved
to
employ
them
in
another
attempt
to
ascend
the
aiguille
d
argenti√®re
upon
which
mountain
we
had
been
cruelly
defeated
just
eight
days
before
it
happened
in
this
had
a
notion
that
the
ascent
of
the
aiguille
could
be
accomplished
by
following
the
ridge
leading
to
its
summit
from
the
col
du
chardonnet
at
six
on
the
morning
of
the
we
found
ourselves
accordingly
on
the
top
of
that
pass
the
party
consisted
of
our
friend
moore
and
his
guide
almer
reilly
and
his
guide
fran√ßois
couttet
myself
and
michel
croz
so
far
the
weather
had
been
calm
and
the
way
easy
but
immediately
we
arrived
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
we
got
into
a
furious
wind
five
minutes
earlier
we
were
warm
we
were
frozen
fine
snow
whirled
up
into
the
air
penetrated
every
crack
in
our
harness
and
assailed
our
skins
as
painfully
as
if
it
had
been
red
hot
instead
of
freezing
cold
the
teeth
chattered
was
laborious
the
breath
froze
instantaneously
eating
was
disagreeable
sitting
was
impossible
we
looked
towards
our
mountain
its
aspect
was
not
encouraging
the
ridge
that
led
upwards
had
a
spiked
ar√™te
palisaded
with
miniature
aiguilles
banked
up
at
their
bases
by
heavy
which
led
down
at
considerable
angles
on
one
side
towards
the
glacier
de
saleinoz
on
the
other
towards
the
glacier
du
chardonnet
under
any
circumstances
it
would
have
been
a
stiff
piece
of
work
to
clamber
up
that
way
prudence
and
comfort
counselled
give
it
discretion
overruled
valour
moore
and
almer
crossed
the
col
du
chardonnet
to
go
to
orsi√®res
and
we
others
returned
towards
chamounix
but
when
we
got
some
distance
down
the
evil
spirit
which
prompts
men
to
ascend
mountains
tempted
us
to
stop
and
to
look
back
at
the
aiguille
d
argenti√®re
the
sky
was
cloudless
no
wind
could
be
felt
nor
sign
of
it
perceived
it
was
only
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
there
right
before
us
we
saw
another
branch
of
the
glacier
leading
high
up
into
the
above
the
col
du
a
little
couloir
rising
from
its
head
almost
to
the
top
of
the
peak
this
was
clearly
the
right
route
to
take
we
turned
back
and
went
at
it
the
glacier
was
steep
and
the
snow
gully
rising
out
of
it
was
steeper
seven
hundred
steps
were
cut
then
the
couloir
became
steep
we
took
to
the
rocks
on
its
left
and
at
last
gained
the
ridge
at
a
point
about
feet
above
the
col
du
chardonnet
we
faced
about
to
the
right
and
went
along
the
ridge
keeping
on
some
snow
a
little
below
its
crest
on
the
saleinoz
side
then
we
got
the
wind
again
yet
no
one
thought
of
turning
for
we
were
within
feet
of
the
summit
the
axes
of
croz
and
couttet
went
to
work
once
more
for
the
slope
was
about
as
steep
as
could
be
its
surface
was
covered
with
a
loose
granular
crust
dry
and
utterly
incoherent
which
slipped
away
in
streaks
directly
it
was
meddled
with
the
men
had
to
cut
through
this
into
the
old
beds
underneath
and
to
pause
incessantly
to
rake
away
the
powdery
stuff
which
poured
down
in
hissing
streams
over
the
hard
substratum
ugh
how
cold
it
was
how
the
wind
blew
couttet
s
hat
was
torn
from
its
fastenings
and
went
on
a
tour
in
switzerland
the
snow
swept
off
the
ridge
above
was
tossed
spirally
upwards
eddying
in
then
dropt
in
lulls
or
caught
by
other
gusts
was
flung
far
and
wide
to
feed
the
saleinoz
my
feet
are
getting
suspiciously
numbed
cried
reilly
how
about
kick
hard
sir
shouted
the
men
it
s
the
only
fingers
were
kept
alive
by
their
work
but
it
was
cold
for
the
feet
and
they
kicked
and
hewed
simultaneously
i
followed
their
example
too
violently
and
made
a
hole
clean
through
my
footing
a
clatter
followed
as
if
crockery
had
been
thrown
down
a
well
i
went
down
a
step
or
two
and
discovered
in
a
second
that
all
were
standing
over
a
cavern
not
a
crevasse
speaking
properly
that
was
bridged
over
by
a
thin
vault
of
ice
from
which
great
icicles
hung
in
groves
almost
in
the
same
minute
reilly
pushed
one
of
his
hands
right
through
the
roof
the
whole
party
might
have
tumbled
through
at
any
moment
go
ahead
croz
we
are
over
a
chasm
we
know
it
he
answered
and
we
can
t
find
a
firm
in
the
blandest
manner
my
comrade
inquired
if
to
persevere
would
not
be
to
do
that
which
is
called
tempting
my
reply
being
in
the
affirmative
he
further
observed
suppose
we
go
down
very
ask
the
they
had
not
the
least
objection
so
we
went
down
and
slept
that
night
at
the
montanvert
off
the
ridge
we
were
out
of
the
wind
in
fact
a
hundred
feet
down
on
the
slope
fronting
the
glacier
du
chardonnet
we
were
broiling
hot
there
was
not
a
suspicion
of
a
breeze
upon
that
side
there
was
nothing
to
tell
that
a
hurricane
was
raging
a
hundred
feet
higher
cloudless
sky
looked
tranquillity
itself
whilst
to
leeward
the
only
sign
of
a
disturbed
atmosphere
was
the
friskiness
of
the
snow
upon
the
crests
of
the
ridges
we
set
out
on
the
with
croz
payot
and
charlet
to
finish
off
the
work
which
had
been
cut
short
so
abruptly
and
slept
as
before
at
the
chalets
de
lognan
on
the
about
midday
we
arrived
upon
the
summit
of
the
aiguille
and
found
that
we
had
actually
been
within
one
hundred
feet
of
it
when
we
turned
back
upon
the
first
attempt
it
was
a
triumph
to
reilly
in
this
neighbourhood
he
had
performed
the
feat
in
of
joining
together
two
mountains
each
about
feet
high
standing
on
the
map
about
a
mile
and
a
half
long
before
we
made
the
ascent
he
had
procured
evidence
which
could
not
be
impugned
that
the
pointe
des
plines
a
fictitious
summit
which
had
figured
on
other
maps
as
a
distinct
mountain
could
be
no
other
than
the
aiguille
d
argenti√®re
and
he
had
accordingly
obliterated
it
from
the
preliminary
draft
of
his
map
we
saw
that
it
was
right
to
do
so
the
pointe
des
plines
did
not
exist
we
had
ocular
demonstration
of
the
accuracy
of
his
previous
observations
i
do
not
know
which
to
admire
most
the
fidelity
of
reilly
s
map
or
the
indefatigable
industry
by
which
the
materials
were
accumulated
from
which
it
was
constructed
to
men
who
are
sound
in
limb
it
may
be
amusing
to
arrive
on
a
summit
as
we
did
upon
the
top
of
mont
dolent
sitting
astride
a
ridge
too
narrow
to
stand
upon
or
to
do
battle
with
a
ferocious
wind
as
we
did
on
the
top
of
the
aiguille
de
tr√©lat√™te
or
to
feel
in
midsummer
as
we
did
on
the
aiguille
d
argenti√®re
but
there
is
extremely
little
amusement
in
making
sketches
and
notes
under
such
conditions
yet
upon
all
these
expeditions
under
the
most
adverse
circumstances
and
in
the
most
trying
situations
reilly
s
brain
and
fingers
were
always
at
work
throughout
all
he
was
ever
alike
the
same
genial
companion
whether
victorious
or
whether
defeated
always
ready
to
sacrifice
his
own
desires
to
suit
our
comfort
and
convenience
by
a
happy
union
of
audacity
and
prudence
combined
with
untiring
perseverance
he
eventually
completed
his
work
which
would
have
been
intolerable
except
as
a
labour
of
which
for
a
single
individual
may
be
termed
herculean
we
separated
upon
the
level

of
the
glacier

reilly
going
with
payot
and

the
chalets
of

whilst
i
with
croz
followed
the
right
bank
of
the
glacier
to
the
village
of
argenti√®re
at
we
entered
the
humble
inn
and
ten
minutes
afterwards
heard
the
echoes
of
the
cannon
which
were
fired
upon
the
arrival
of
our
comrades
at

the

the

from

has
undergone

improvements
in

years

mendicants
permanently
disfigure
it

nothing

one
universal
chorus
give

you
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
something
from
sierre
we
went
up
the
val
d
anniviers
to
zinal
to
join
our
former
companions
moore
and
almer
moore
was
ambitious
to
discover
a
shorter
way
from
zinal
to
zermatt
than
the
two
passes
which
were
known
he
had
shown
to
me
upon
dufour
s
map
that
a
direct
line
connecting
the
two
places
passed
exactly
over
the
depression
between
the
and
the
schallhorn
he
was
confident
that
a
passage
could
be
effected
over
this
depression
and
was
sanguine
that
it
would
in
consequence
of
its
directness
prove
to
be
a
quicker
route
than
the
circuitous
ones
over
the
triftjoch
and
the
col
durand
he
was
awaiting
us
and
we
immediately
proceeded
up
the
valley
and
across
the
foot
of
the
zinal
glacier
to
the
arpitetta
alp
where
a
chalet
was
supposed
to
exist
in
which
we
might
pass
the
night
we
found
it
at
length
but
it
was
not
equal
to
our
expectations
it
was
not
one
of
those
fine
timbered
chalets
with
huge
overhanging
eaves
covered
with
pious
sentences
carved
in
unintelligible
characters
it
was
a
hovel
growing
as
it
were
out
of
the
roofed
with
rough
slabs
of
slaty
stone
without
a
door
or
window
surrounded
by
quagmires
of
ordure
and
dirt
of
every
description
a
foul
native
invited
us
to
enter
the
interior
was
dark
and
when
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
gloom
we
saw
that
our
palace
was
in
plan
about
by
feet
on
one
side
it
was
scarcely
five
feet
high
and
on
the
other
was
nearly
seven
on
this
side
there
was
a
raised
platform
about
six
feet
wide
littered
with
dirty
straw
and
still
dirtier
sheepskins
this
was
the
bedroom
the
remainder
of
the
width
of
the
apartment
was
the
parlour
the
rest
was
the
factory
cheese
was
the
article
which
was
being
fabricated
and
the
foul
native
was
engaged
in
its
manufacture
he
was
garnished
behind
with
a
regular
cowherd
s
stool
which
gave
him
a
queer
uncanny
look
when
it
was
elevated
in
the
air
as
he
bent
over
into
his
tub
for
the
making
of
his
cheese
required
him
to
blow
into
a
tub
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
he
then
squatted
on
his
stool
to
gain
breath
and
took
a
few
whiffs
at
a
short
pipe
after
which
he
blew
away
more
vigorously
than
before
we
were
told
that
this
procedure
was
necessary
it
appeared
to
us
to
be
nasty
it
accounts
perhaps
for
the
flavour
possessed
by
certain
swiss
cheeses
big
black
and
clouds
rolled
up
from
zinal
and
met
in
combat
on
the
moming
glacier
with
others
which
descended
from
the
rothhorn
down
came
the
rain
in
torrents
and
crash
went
the
thunder
the
hurried
under
shelter
for
the
frightened
cattle
needed
no
driving
and
tore
spontaneously
down
the
alp
as
if
running
a
men
cows
pigs
sheep
and
goats
forgot
their
mutual
animosities
and
rushed
to
the
only
refuge
on
the
mountain
the
spell
was
broken
which
had
bound
the
elements
for
some
weeks
past
and
the
from
the
weisshorn
to
lo
besso
was
the
theatre
in
which
they
spent
their
fury
a
sullen
morning
succeeded
an
angry
night
we
were
undecided
in
our
council
whether
to
advance
or
to
return
down
the
valley
good
seemed
likely
to
overpower
bad
so
at
we
left
the
chalet
for
our
pass
amidst
the
most
encouraging
assurances
from
all
the
people
on
the
alp
that
we
need
not
distress
ourselves
about
the
weather
as
it
was
not
possible
to
get
to
the
point
at
which
we
were
aiming
our
course
led
us
at
first
over
ordinary
mountain
slopes
and
then
over
a
flat
expanse
of
glacier
before
this
was
quitted
it
was
needful
to
determine
the
exact
line
which
was
to
be
taken
we
were
divided
betwixt
two
opinions
i
advocated
that
a
course
should
be
steered
due
south
and
that
the
upper
plateau
of
the
moming
glacier
should
be
attained
by
making
a
great
detour
to
our
right
this
was
negatived
without
a
division
almer
declared
in
favour
of
making
for
some
rocks
to
the
of
the
schallhorn
and
attaining
the
upper
plateau
of
the
glacier
by
mounting
them
croz
advised
a
middle
course
up
some
very
steep
and
broken
glacier
croz
s
route
seemed
likely
to
turn
out
to
be
impracticable
because
much
would
be
required
upon
it
almer
s
rocks
did
not
look
good
they
were
possibly
unassailable
i
thought
both
routes
were
bad
and
declined
to
vote
for
either
of
them
moore
hesitated
almer
gave
way
and
croz
s
route
was
adopted
he
did
not
go
very
far
however
before
he
found
that
he
had
undertaken
too
much
and
after
glancing
occasionally
round
at
us
to
see
what
we
thought
about
it
suggested
that
it
might
after
all
be
wiser
to
take
to
the
rocks
of
the
schallhorn
that
is
to
say
he
suggested
the
abandonment
of
his
own
and
the
adoption
of
almer
s
route
no
one
opposed
the
change
of
plan
and
in
the
absence
of
instructions
to
the
contrary
he
proceeded
to
cut
steps
across
an
towards
the
rocks
let
the
reader
now
cast
his
eye
upon
the
map
of
the
valley
of
zermatt
and
he
will
see
that
when
we
quitted
the
slopes
of
the
arpitetta
alp
we
took
a
course
over
the
moming
glacier
we
halted
to
settle
the
plan
of
attack
shortly
after
we
got
upon
the
ice
the
rocks
of
the
schallhorn
whose
ascent
almer
recommended
were
then
to
our
croz
s
proposed
route
was
to
the
of
the
rocks
and
led
up
the
southern
side
of
a
very
steep
and
broken
glacier
the
part
he
intended
to
traverse
was
in
a
sense
undoubtedly
practicable
he
gave
it
up
because
it
would
have
involved
too
much
but
the
part
of
this
glacier
which
intervened
between
his
route
and
almer
s
rocks
was
in
the
most
complete
sense
of
the
word
impracticable
it
passed
over
a
continuation
of
the
rocks
and
was
broken
in
half
by
them
the
upper
portion
was
separated
from
the
lower
portion
by
a
long
slope
of
ice
that
had
been
built
up
from
the
d√©bris
of
the
glacier
which
had
fallen
from
above
the
foot
of
this
slope
was
surrounded
by
immense
quantities
of
the
larger
avalanche
blocks
these
we
cautiously
skirted
and
when
croz
halted
they
had
been
left
far
below
and
we
were
up
the
side
of
the
great
slope
which
led
to
the
base
of
the
above
across
this
croz
now
proceeded
to
cut
it
was
executing
a
flank
movement
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
by
whom
we
might
be
attacked
at
any
moment
the
peril
was
obvious
it
was
a
monstrous
folly
it
was
foolhardiness
a
retreat
should
have
been
sounded
i
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
wrote
moore
in
his
journal
that
during
the
whole
time
we
were
crossing
this
slope
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
and
i
never
felt
relieved
from
such
a
load
of
care
as
when
after
i
suppose
a
passage
of
about
twenty
minutes
we
got
on
to
the
rocks
and
were
in
safety
i
have
never
heard
a
positive
oath
come
from
almer
s
mouth
but
the
language
in
which
he
kept
up
a
running
commentary
more
to
himself
than
to
me
as
we
went
along
was
stronger
than
i
should
have
given
him
credit
for
using
his
prominent
feeling
seemed
to
be
one
of
that
we
should
be
in
such
a
position
and
at
being
a
party
to
the
proceeding
while
the
emphatic
way
in
which
at
intervals
he
exclaimed
quick
be
quick
sufficiently
betokened
his
it
was
not
necessary
to
admonish
croz
to
be
quick
he
was
fully
as
alive
to
the
risk
as
any
of
the
others
he
told
me
afterwards
that
this
place
was
the
most
dangerous
he
had
ever
crossed
and
that
no
consideration
whatever
would
tempt
him
to
cross
it
again
manfully
did
he
exert
himself
to
escape
from
the
impending
destruction
his
head
bent
down
to
his
work
never
turned
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
one
two
three
went
his
axe
and
then
he
stepped
on
to
the
spot
where
he
had
been
cutting
how
painfully
insecure
should
we
have
considered
those
steps
at
any
other
time
but
now
we
thought
only
of
the
rocks
in
front
and
of
the
hideous
lurching
over
above
us
apparently
in
the
act
of
falling
we
got
to
the
rocks
in
safety
and
if
they
had
been
doubly
as
difficult
as
they
were
we
should
still
have
been
well
content
we
sat
down
and
refreshed
the
inner
man
keeping
our
eyes
on
the
towering
pinnacles
of
ice
under
which
we
had
passed
but
which
now
were
almost
beneath
us
without
a
preliminary
warning
sound
one
of
the
high
as
the
monument
at
london
upon
the
slope
below
the
stately
mass
heeled
over
as
if
upon
a
hinge
holding
together
until
it
bent
degrees
forwards
then
it
crushed
out
its
base
and
rent
into
a
thousand
fragments
plunged
vertically
down
upon
the
slope
that
we
had
crossed
every
atom
of
our
track
that
was
in
its
course
was
obliterated
all
the
new
snow
was
swept
away
and
a
broad
sheet
of
smooth
glassy
ice
showed
the
resistless
force
with
which
it
had
fallen
illustration
on
the
moming
pass
it
was
inexcusable
to
follow
such
a
perilous
path
but
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
it
was
taken
to
have
retreated
from
the
place
where
croz
suggested
a
change
of
plan
to
have
descended
below
the
reach
of
danger
and
to
have
mounted
again
by
the
route
which
almer
suggested
would
have
been
equivalent
to
abandoning
the
excursion
for
no
one
would
have
passed
another
night
in
the
chalet
on
the
arpitetta
alp
many
says
thucydides
though
seeing
well
the
perils
ahead
are
forced
along
by
fear
of
the
world
calls
that
vanquished
by
a
mere
word
they
fall
into
irremediable
such
was
nearly
the
case
here
no
one
could
say
a
word
in
justification
of
the
course
which
was
adopted
all
were
alive
to
the
danger
that
was
being
encountered
yet
a
grave
risk
was
in
preference
to
admitting
by
withdrawal
from
an
untenable
position
that
an
error
of
judgment
had
been
committed
after
a
laborious
trudge
over
many
species
of
snow
and
through
many
varieties
of
the
quality
of
a
scotch
mist
to
that
of
a
london
at
length
stood
on
the
depression
between
the
rothhorn
and
the
schallhorn
a
steep
wall
of
snow
was
upon
the
zinal
side
of
the
summit
but
what
the
descent
was
like
on
the
other
side
we
could
not
tell
for
a
billow
of
snow
tossed
over
its
crest
by
the
western
winds
suspended
o
er
zermatt
with
motion
arrested
resembling
an
frozen
in
the
act
of
breaking
cut
off
the
view
hard
in
by
the
others
who
kept
down
the
zinal
his
shoulders
flogged
down
the
foam
and
cut
away
the
cornice
to
its
junction
with
the
summit
then
boldly
leaped
down
and
called
on
us
to
follow
him
illustration
summit
of
the
moming
pass
in
it
was
well
for
us
now
that
we
had
such
a
man
as
leader
an
inferior
or
less
daring
guide
would
have
hesitated
to
enter
upon
the
descent
in
a
dense
mist
and
croz
himself
would
have
done
right
to
pause
had
he
been
less
magnificent
in
he
acted
rather
than
said
where
snow
lies
fast
there
man
can
go
where
ice
exists
a
way
may
be
cut
it
is
a
question
of
power
i
have
the
power
you
have
to
do
is
to
follow
truly
he
did
not
spare
himself
and
could
he
have
performed
the
feats
upon
the
boards
of
a
theatre
that
he
did
upon
this
occasion
he
would
have
brought
down
the
house
with
thunders
of
applause
here
is
what
moore
wrote
in
journal
the
descent
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
col
de
pilatte
but
was
very
much
steeper
and
altogether
more
difficult
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
croz
was
in
his
element
and
selected
his
way
with
marvellous
sagacity
while
almer
had
an
equally
honourable
and
perhaps
more
responsible
post
in
the
rear
which
he
kept
with
his
usual
steadiness
one
particular
passage
has
impressed
itself
on
my
mind
as
one
of
the
most
nervous
i
have
ever
made
we
had
to
pass
along
a
crest
of
ice
a
mere
our
left
a
broad
crevasse
whose
bottom
was
lost
in
blue
haze
and
on
our
right
at
an
angle
of
or
more
a
slope
falling
to
a
similar
gulf
below
croz
as
he
went
along
the
edge
chipped
small
notches
in
the
ice
in
which
we
placed
our
feet
with
the
toes
well
turned
out
doing
all
we
knew
to
preserve
our
balance
while
stepping
from
one
of
these
precarious
footholds
to
another
i
staggered
for
a
moment
i
had
not
really
lost
my
footing
but
the
agonised
tone
in
which
almer
who
was
behind
me
on
seeing
me
waver
exclaimed
slip
not
sir
gave
us
an
even
livelier
impression
than
we
already
had
of
the
insecurity
of
the
position
one
huge
chasm
whose
upper
edge
was
far
above
the
lower
one
could
neither
be
leaped
nor
turned
and
threatened
to
prove
an
insuperable
barrier
but
croz
showed
himself
equal
to
the
emergency
held
up
by
the
rest
of
the
party
he
cut
a
series
of
holes
for
the
hands
and
feet
down
and
along
the
almost
perpendicular
wall
of
ice
forming
the
upper
side
of
the
down
this
slippery
staircase
we
crept
with
our
faces
to
the
wall
until
a
point
was
reached
where
the
width
of
the
chasm
was
not
too
great
for
us
to
drop
across
before
we
had
done
we
got
quite
accustomed
to
taking
flying
leaps
over
the
to
make
a
long
story
short
after
a
most
desperate
and
exciting
struggle
and
as
bad
a
piece
of
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
we
emerged
on
to
the
upper
plateau
of
the
hohlicht
glacier
the
glimpses
which
had
been
caught
of
the
lower
part
of
the
hohlicht
glacier
were
discouraging
so
it
was
now
determined
to
cross
over
the
ridge
between
it
and
the
rothhorn
glacier
this
was
not
done
without
great
trouble
again
we
rose
to
a
height
exceeding
feet
eventually
we
took
to
the
track
of
the
despised
triftjoch
and
descended
by
the
but
rough
path
which
leads
to
that
pass
arriving
at
the
monte
rosa
hotel
at
zermatt
at
we
occupied
nearly
twelve
hours
of
actual
walking
in
coming
from
the
chalet
on
the
arpitetta
alp
which
was
hours
above
zinal
and
we
consequently
found
that
the
moming
pass
was
not
the
shortest
route
from
zinal
to
zermatt
although
it
was
the
most
direct
two
dozen
bad
and
indifferent
french
swiss

commonly
be
seen
sitting
on
the
wall
on
the
front
of
the
monte
rosa
hotel
waiting
on
their
employers
and
looking
for
employers
watching
new
arrivals
and
speculating
on
the
number
of
francs
which
may
be
extracted
from
their
pockets
the
strangely
and
wonderfully
about
in
groups
or
lean
back
in
chairs
or
lounge
on
the
benches
which
are
placed
by
the
door
they
wear
extraordinary
boots
and
still
more
remarkable
their
peeled
blistered
and
swollen
faces
are
worth
studying
some
by
the
exercise
of
watchfulness
and
unremitting

have
been
fortunate
enough
to
acquire
a
fine
raw
sienna
complexion

most
of
them
have
not
been
so
happy
they
have
been
scorched
on
rocks
and
roasted
on
glaciers
their

exuded
a
matter
which
has
coursed
down
their
faces
and
has
dried
in
patches
like
the
resin
on
the
trunks
of
pines
they
have
removed
it
and
at
the
same
time
have
pulled
off
large
flakes
of
their
skin
they
have
gone
from
bad

and
scissors
have
been
called
into

tenderly
and
daintily
they
have
endeavoured
to
reduce
their

it
is
not
to
be
done
but
they
have
gone
on
fascinated
and
at
last
have
brought
their
unhappy
countenances
to
a
state
of
helpless
and
complete
ruin
their

are
cracked
their

peeled

indescribable

of

in
such
are
the
pleasures
of
the
mountaineer
scornfully
and
derisively
the
last

compares
the
sight
with
his
own
flaccid
face
and
dainty
hands
unconscious
that
he
too
perhaps
will
be
numbered
with
those

now
ridicules
there
is
a
frankness
of
manner
about
these
and
men
which
does
not
remind
one
of
or
city
life
and
it
is
good
to
this
of
cold
bodies
our
countrymen
regale
together
when
brought
into
contact
and
it
is
pleasant
to
witness
the
hearty
welcome
given
to
the
by
the
host
and
his
excellent
wife
i
left
this
agreeable
society
to
seek
letters
at
the
post
they
yielded
disastrous
intelligence
my
holiday
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
termination
and
i
awaited
the
arrival
of
reilly
who
was
convoying
the
stores
for
the
attack
on
the
matterhorn
only
to
inform
him
that
our
arrangements
were
upset
then
travelled
home
day
and

as
fast
as
express
trains
would
carry
me
chapter
xii
the
first
ascent
of
the
grand
cornier
ye
crags
and
peaks
i
m
with
you
once
again
methinks
i
hear
a
spirit
in
your
echoes
answers
me
and
bid
your
tenant
welcome
to
his
home
again
knowles
our
career
in
had
been
one
of
unbroken
success
but
the
great
ascent
upon
which
i
had
set
my
heart
was
not
attempted
and
until
it
was
accomplished
i
was
unsatisfied
other
things
too
influenced
me
to
visit
the
alps
once
more
i
wished
to
travel
elsewhere
in
places
where
the
responsibility
of
direction
would
rest
with
myself
alone
it
was
well
to
know
how
far
my
judgment
in
the
choice
of
routes
could
be
relied
upon
the
journey
of
was
chiefly
undertaken
then
to
find
out
to
what
extent
i
was
capable
to
select
paths
over
mountainous
country
the
programme
which
was
drawn
up
for
this
journey
was
rather
ambitious
since
it
included
almost
all
of
the
great
peaks
which
had
not
then
been
ascended
but
it
was
neither
lightly
undertaken
nor
hastily
executed
all
pains
were
taken
to
secure
success
information
was
sought
from
those
who
could
give
it
and
the
defeats
of
others
were
studied
that
their
errors
might
be
avoided
the
results
which
followed
came
not
so
much
perhaps
from
luck
as
from
forethought
and
careful
calculation
for
success
does
not
as
a
rule
come
by
chance
and
when
one
fails
there
is
a
reason
for
it
but
when
any
notable
or
brilliant
thing
is
done
we
are
too
apt
to
look
upon
the
success
alone
without
considering
how
it
was
accomplished
whilst
when
men
fail
we
inquire
why
they
have
not
succeeded
so
failures
are
oftentimes
more
instructive
than
successes
and
the
disappointments
of
some
become
profitable
to
others
up
to
a
certain
point
the
programme
was
completely
and
happily
carried
out
nothing
but
success
attended
our
efforts
so
long
as
the
excursions
were
executed
as
they
had
been
planned
most
of
them
were
made
upon
the
very
days
which
had
been
fixed
for
them
months
beforehand
and
all
were
accomplished
comparatively
speaking
so
easily
that
their
descriptions
must
be
in
the
absence
of
difficulty
and
danger
less
interesting
to
the
general
reader
than
they
would
have
been
if
our
course
had
been
marked
by
blunders
and
want
of
judgment
before
proceeding
to
speak
of
these
excursions
it
will
not
be
entirely
useless
to
explain
the
reasons
which
influenced
the
selection
of
the
routes
which
were
adopted
upon
them
in
the
course
of
the
past
five
seasons
my
early
practices
were
revolutionised
my
antipathy
to
snow
was
overcome
and
my
predilection
for
rocks
was
modified
like
all
those
who
are
not
mountaineers
born
i
was
at
the
first
extremely
nervous
upon
steep
snow
the
snow
seemed
bound
to
slip
and
all
those
who
were
upon
it
to
go
along
with
it
snow
of
a
certain
quality
is
undoubtedly
liable
to
slip
when
it
is
at
a
certain
inclination
the
exact
states
which
are
dangerous
or
safe
it
is
not
possible
to
describe
in
writing
that
is
only
learnt
by
experience
and
confidence
upon
snow
is
not
really
felt
until
one
has
gained
experience
confidence
gradually
came
to
me
and
as
it
came
so
did
my
partiality
for
rocks
diminish
for
it
was
evident
to
use
a
common
expression
that
it
paid
better
to
travel
upon
snow
than
upon
rocks
this
applies
to
pure
and
simple
or
to
snow
which
is
lying
over
glacier
and
in
the
selection
of
routes
it
has
latterly
always
been
my
practice
to
look
for
the
places
where
snow
slopes
or
glaciers
reach
highest
into
mountains
it
is
comparatively
seldom
however
that
an
ascent
of
a
great
mountain
can
be
executed
exclusively
upon
snow
and
glacier
ridges
peep
through
which
have
to
be
surmounted
in
my
earlier
scramblings
i
usually
took
to
or
was
taken
upon
the
summits
or
ar√™tes
of
the
ridges
and
a
good
many
mountaineers
habitually
take
to
them
on
principle
as
the
natural
and
proper
way
according
to
my
experience
it
is
seldom
well
to
do
so
when
any
other
course
is
open
as
i
have
already
said
and
presently
shall
repeat
more
particularly
the
crests
of
all
the
main
ridges
of
the
great
peaks
of
the
alps
are
shattered
and
cleft
by
frost
and
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
a
notch
in
a
ridge
which
appears
perfectly
insignificant
from
a
distance
is
found
to
be
an
insuperable
barrier
to
farther
progress
and
a
great
detour
or
a
long
descent
has
to
be
made
to
avoid
the
obstacle
when
committed
to
an
ar√™te
one
is
tied
almost
always
to
a
particular
course
from
which
it
is
difficult
to
deviate
much
loss
of
time
must
result
if
any
serious
obstruction
occurs
and
defeat
often
follows
a
temporary
check
but
it
rarely
happens
that
a
great
alpine
peak
is
seen
that
is
cut
off
abruptly
in
all
directions
from
the
snows
and
glaciers
which
surround
it
in
its
gullies
snow
will
cling
although
its
faces
may
be
too
steep
for
the
formation
of
permanent
the
merits
of
these
or
have
been
already
pointed
out
and
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
observe
after
that
which
was
just
now
said
about
snow
that
ascents
of
with
proper
precautions
are
very
much
to
be
preferred
to
ascents
of
rocky
ar√™tes
by
following
the
glaciers
the
above
and
the
couloirs
rising
from
them
it
is
usually
possible
to
get
very
close
to
the
summits
of
the
great
peaks
in
the
alps
the
final
climb
will
perhaps
necessarily
be
by
an
ar√™te
the
less
of
it
the
better
it
occasionally
occurs
that
considerable
mountain
slopes
or
faces
are
destitute
of
in
that
case
it
will
very
likely
be
best
to
adhere
to
the
faces
or
to
the
gullies
or
minor
ridges
upon
them
rather
than
to
take
to
the
ridges
upon
a
face
one
can
move
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
with
more
facility
than
upon
the
crest
of
a
ridge
and
when
a
difficulty
is
arrived
at
it
is
consequently
less
troublesome
to
circumvent
in
selecting
the
routes
which
were
taken
in
i
looked
first
for
places
where
glaciers
and
snow
extended
highest
up
into
the
mountains
which
were
to
be
ascended
or
the
ridges
which
were
to
be
crossed
next
for
gullies
filled
with
snow
leading
still
higher
and
finally
from
the
heads
of
the
gullies
we
completed
the
ascents
whenever
it
was
practicable
by
faces
instead
of
by
ar√™tes
the
ascent
of
the
grand
cornier
of
the
dent
blanche
grandes
jorasses
aiguille
verte
ruinette
and
the
matterhorn
were
all
accomplished
in
this
way
besides
the
other
excursions
which
will
be
referred
to
by
and
by
the
route
selected
before
the
start
was
made
was
in
every
case
strictly
followed
out
we
inspected
all
of
these
mountains
from
neighbouring
heights
before
entering
upon
their
ascents
i
explained
to
the
guides
the
routes
i
proposed
to
be
taken
and
when
the
courses
were
at
all
complicated
sketched
them
out
on
paper
to
prevent
misunderstanding
in
some
few
cases
they
suggested
variations
and
in
every
case
the
route
was
well
discussed
the
of
the
work
was
done
by
the
guides
and
i
seldom
interfered
with
or
attempted
to
assist
in
it
the
of
june
i
spent
in
the
valley
of
lauterbrunnen
with
the
rev
hawker
and
the
guides
christian
and
ulrich
lauener
and
on
the
crossed
the
petersgrat
with
christian
almer
and
johann
t√§nnler
to
turtman
tourtemagne
in
the
valais
t√§nnler
was
then
paid
off
as
michel
croz
and
franz
biener
were
awaiting
me
it
was
not
possible
to
find
two
leading
guides
who
worked
together
more
harmoniously
than
croz
and
almer
biener
s
part
was
subordinate
to
theirs
and
he
was
added
as
a
convenience
rather
than
as
a
necessity
croz
spoke
french
alone
almer
little
else
than
german
biener
spoke
both
languages
and
was
useful
on
that
account
but
he
seldom
went
to
the
front
excepting
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
when
the
work
was
easy
and
he
acted
throughout
more
as
a
porter
than
as
a
guide
the
importance
of
having
a
reserve
of
power
on
mountain
expeditions
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
upon
we
always
had
some
in
hand
and
were
never
pressed
or
overworked
so
long
as
we
were
together
come
what
might
we
were
ready
for
it
but
by
a
series
of
chances
which
i
shall
never
cease
to
regret
i
was
first
obliged
to
part
with
croz
and
then
to
dismiss
the
others
and
so
deviating
from
the
course
that
i
had
deliberately
adopted
which
was
successful
in
practice
because
it
was
sound
in
principle
became
fortuitously
a
member
of
an
expedition
that
ended
with
the
catastrophe
which
brings
this
book
and
brought
my
scrambles
amongst
the
alps
to
a
close
on
june
we
went
from
turtman
to
z
meiden
and
thence
over
the
forcletta
pass
to
zinal
we
diverged
from
the
summit
of
the
pass
up
some
neighbouring
heights
to
inspect
the
grand
cornier
and
i
decided
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
northern
side
it
seemed
quite
safe
to
pronounce
it
inaccessible
from
that
direction
although
it
was
more
than
seven
miles
away
on
the
we
left
zinal
at
having
been
for
a
moment
greatly
surprised
by
an
entry
in
the
and
ascending
by
the
zinal
glacier
and
giving
the
base
of
our
mountain
a
wide
berth
in
order
that
it
might
be
better
examined
passed
gradually
right
round
to
its
south
before
a
way
up
it
was
seen
at
we
arrived
upon
the
plateau
of
the
glacier
that
descends
towards
the
east
between
the
grand
cornier
and
the
dent
blanche
and
from
this
place
a
route
was
readily
traced
we
steered
to
the
north
as
shown
upon
the
map
over
the
glacier
towards
the
ridge
that
descends
to
the
east
gained
it
by
mounting
and
followed
it
to
the
summit
which
was
arrived
at
before
twelve
from
first
to
last
the
route
was
almost
entirely
over
snow
the
ridges
leading
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
from
the
summit
of
the
grand
cornier
exhibited
in
a
most
striking
manner
the
extraordinary
effects
that
may
be
produced
by
violent
alternations
of
heat
and
cold
the
southern
one
was
hacked
and
split
into
the
wildest
forms
and
the
northern
one
was
not
less
cleft
and
impracticable
and
offered
the
droll
piece
of
which
is
represented
upon
page
some
small
blocks
actually
tottered
and
fell
before
our
eyes
and
starting
others
in
their
downward
course
grew
into
a
perfect
avalanche
which
descended
with
a
solemn
roar
on
to
the
glaciers
beneath
illustration
part
of
the
southern
ridge
of
the
grand
cornier
it
is
natural
that
the
great
ridges
should
present
the
wildest
on
account
of
their
dimensions
but
by
reason
of
their
positions
they
are
exposed
to
the
fiercest
heat
of
the
sun
and
are
seldom
in
shadow
as
long
as
it
is
above
the
horizon
they
are
entirely
unprotected
and
are
attacked
by
the
strongest
blasts
and
by
the
most
intense
cold
the
most
durable
rocks
are
not
proof
against
such
assaults
these
grand
apparently
seeming
so
firm
so
immutable
are
yet
ever
changing
and
crumbling
into
dust
these
shattered
ridges
are
evidence
of
their
sufferings
let
me
repeat
that
every
principal
ridge
of
every
great
peak
in
the
alps
amongst
those
i
have
seen
has
been
shattered
in
this
way
and
that
every
summit
amongst
the
upon
which
i
have
stood
has
been
nothing
but
a
heap
of
fragments
the
minor
ridges
do
not
usually
present
such
extraordinary
forms
as
the
principal
ones
they
are
less
exposed
and
they
are
less
broken
up
and
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
their
annual
degradation
is
less
than
that
of
the
the
wear
and
tear
does
not
cease
even
in
winter
for
these
great
ridges
are
never
completely
covered
up
by
snow
and
the
sun
has
still
power
the
destruction
is
incessant
and
increases
as
time
goes
on
for
the
greater
the
surfaces
which
are
exposed
to
the
practically
inexhaustible
powers
of
sun
and
frost
the
greater
ruin
will
be
effected
illustration
part
of
the
northern
ridge
of
the
grand
cornier
the
which
are
continually
occurring
upon
all
rock
mountains
such
as
are
referred
to
upon
pp
are
of
course
caused
by
these
powers
no
one
doubts
it
but
one
never
believes
it
so
thoroughly
as
when
the
quarries
are
seen
from
which
their
materials
have
been
hewn
and
when
the
germs
so
to
speak
of
these
avalanches
have
been
seen
actually
starting
from
above
these
falls
of
rock
take
place
from
two
causes
first
from
the
heat
of
the
sun
detaching
small
stones
or
rocks
which
have
been
arrested
on
ledges
or
slopes
and
bound
together
by
snow
or
ice
i
have
seen
such
released
many
times
when
the
sun
has
risen
high
fall
gently
at
first
gather
strength
grow
in
volume
and
at
last
rush
down
with
a
cloud
trailing
behind
like
the
dust
after
an
express
train
secondly
from
the
freezing
of
the
water
which
trickles
during
the
day
into
the
clefts
fissures
and
crannies
this
agency
is
naturally
most
active
in
the
night
and
then
or
during
very
cold
weather
the
greatest
falls
take
place
when
one
has
continually
seen
and
heard
these
falls
it
is
easily
understood
why
the
glaciers
are
laden
with
moraines
the
wonder
is
not
that
they
are
sometimes
so
great
but
that
they
are
not
always
greater
irrespective
of
lithological
considerations
one
knows
that
this
d√©bris
can
not
have
been
excavated
the
glaciers
the
moraines
are
by
glaciers
but
they
are
from
the
ridges
they
are
generated
by
the
sun
and
delivered
by
the
frost
fire
it
is
well
said
in
plutarch
s
life
of
camillus
is
the
most
active
thing
in
nature
and
all
generation
is
motion
or
at
least
with
motion
all
other
parts
of
matter
without
warmth
lie
sluggish
and
dead
and
crave
the
influence
of
heat
as
their
life
and
when
that
comes
upon
them
they
immediately
acquire
some
active
or
passive
if
the
alps
were
granted
a
perfectly
invariable
temperature
if
they
were
no
longer
subjected
alternately
to
freezing
blasts
and
to
scorching
heat
they
might
more
correctly
be

their

would
be

constantly
because

what
can

conclude
then
but
that

have
had
infinitely
more
to
do
than

with
the

who
can
refuse

believe
that
powers
which
are
at
work
everywhere
which
have
been
at
work
always
which
are
so
incomparably
active
capable
and
enduring
must
have
produced
greater
effects
than
a
solitary
power
which
is
always
local
in
its
influence
which
has
worked
but
for
a
short
time
which
is
always
slow
and
feeble
in
its
operations
and
which
constantly
diminishes
in
intensity
yet
there
are
some
who
refuse
to
believe
that
sun
frost
and
water
have
played
an
important
part
in
modelling
the
alps
and
hold
it
as
an
article
of
their
faith
that
the
alpine
region
owes
its
present
conformation
mainly
to
the
action
of
its
ancient
glaciers

interrupted
by

the

to
be
one
of

most

they

a

added

kennedy
started
from

between
and
on

ascending
the
glacier
that
is
mentioned
in
the
opening
paragraph
went
towards
the
point
marked
m√®tres
upon
the

then
turned
to
the
left
that
is
to
the
north
and
completed
the
ascent
by
the
southern
which
overhangs
the
western
side
of
the
sch√∂nb√ºhl
glacier
kennedy
described
his
expedition
in
a
very
interesting
paper
in
the
his
account
bore
the
impress
of
truth
yet
unbelievers
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
have
told
in
weather
such
as
was
experienced
whether
the
summit
had
actually
been
attained
and
sometimes
roundly
asserted
that
the
mountain
as
the
saying
is
still
remained
virgin
i
did
not
share
these
doubts
although
they
influenced
me
to
make
the
ascent
i
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
find
an
easier
route
than
that
taken
by
kennedy
and
that
if
we
succeeded
in
discovering
one
we
should
be
able
at
once
to
refute
his
traducers
and
to
vaunt
our
superior
wisdom
actuated
by
these
elevated
motives
i
halted
my
little
army
at
the
foot
of
the
glacier
and
inquired
which
is
best
for
us
to
do
ascend
the
dent
blanche
or
to
cross
to
zermatt
they
answered
with
befitting
solemnity
we
think
dent
blanche
is
from
the
chalets
of
abricolla
the
face
of
the
dent
blanche
is
regarded
almost
exactly
in
profile
from
thence
it
is
seen
that
the
angle
of
the
face
scarcely
exceeds
thirty
degrees
and
after
observing
this
i
concluded
that
the
face
would
in
all
probability
give
an
easier
path
to
the
summit
than
the
crest
of
the
very
jagged
ridge
which
was
followed
by
kennedy
we
zigzagged
up
the
glacier
along
the
foot
of
the
face
and
looked
for
a
way
on
to
it
we
looked
for
some
time
in
vain
for
a
mighty
effectually
prevented
approach
and
like
a
fortress
moat
protected
the
wall
from
assault
we
went
up
and
up
until
i
suppose
we
were
not
more
than
a
thousand
feet
below
the
point
marked
m√®tres
then
a
bridge
was
discovered
and
we
dropped
down
on
hands
and
knees
to
cross
it
illustration
the
bergschrund
on
the
dent
blanche
in
a
bergschrund
it
was
said
on
is
a
schrund
and
something
more
than
a
schrund
a
schrund
is
simply
a
big
crevasse
a
bergschrund
is
frequently
although
not
always
a
big
crevasse
the
term
is
applied
to
the
last
of
the
crevasses
that
one
finds
in
ascending
before
quitting
the
glacier
and
taking
to
the
rocks
which
bound
it
it
is
the
mountains
schrund
sometimes
it
is
large
but
early
in
the
season
that
is
to
say
in
the
month
of
june
or
before
bergschrunds
are
usually
snowed
up
or
well
bridged
over
and
do
not
give
much
trouble
later
in
the
year
say
in
august
they
are
frequently
very
great
hindrances
and
occasionally
are
completely
impassable
they
are
lines
of
rupture
consequent
upon
unequal
motion
the
glaciers
below
move
quicker
than
the
snow
or
ice
which
clings
immediately
to
the
mountains
hence
these
fissures
result
the
slower
motion
of
that
which
is
above
can
only
be
attributed
to
its
having
to
sustain
greater
friction
for
the
rule
is
that
the
upper
portion
is
set
at
a
steeper
angle
than
the
lower
as
that
is
the
case
we
should
expect
that
the
upper
portion
would
move
than
the
lower
and
it
would
do
so
doubtless
but
for
the
retardation
of
the
rocks
over
which
and
through
which
it
passes
we
crossed
the
bergschrund
of
the
dent
blanche
i
suppose
at
a
height
of
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
our
work
may
be
said
to
have
commenced
at
that
point
the
face
although
not
steep
in
its
general
inclination
was
so
cut
up
by
little
ridges
and
cliffs
and
so
seamed
with
incipient
couloirs
that
it
had
all
the
difficulty
of
a
much
more
precipitous
slope
the
difficulties
were
never
great
but
they
were
numerous
and
made
a
very
respectable
total
when
put
together
we
passed
the
bergschrund
soon
after
nine
in
the
morning
and
during
the
next
eleven
hours
halted
only
minutes
the
whole
of
the
remainder
of
the
time
was
occupied
in
ascending
and
descending
the
feet
which
compose
this
face
and
inasmuch
as
feet
per
hour
taking
the
mean
of
ascent
and
descent
is
an
ordinary
rate
of
progression
it
is
tolerably
certain
that
the
dent
blanche
is
a
mountain
of
exceptional
difficulty
the
hindrances
opposed
to
us
by
the
mountain
itself
were
however
as
nothing
compared
with
the
atmospheric
obstructions
it
is
true

was

and
we
all
drew
in
the
rope
as
the
great
man
followed
forwards
once
so
on
five
hundred
feet
of
this
kind
of
work
had
been
accomplished
when
we
were
saluted
not
entirely
unexpectedly
by
the
first
gust
of
a
hurricane
which
was
raging
above
the
day
was
a
lovely
one
for
dwellers
in
the
valleys
but
we
had
long
ago
noted
some
light
gossamer
clouds
that
were
hovering
round
our
summit
being
drawn
out
in
a
suspicious
manner
into
long
silky
threads
croz
indeed
prophesied
before
we
had
crossed
the
schrund
that
we
should
be
beaten
by
the
wind
and
had
advised
that
we
should
return
but
i
had
retorted
no
my
good
croz
you
said
just
now
dent
blanche
is
best
we
must
go
up
the
dent
i
have
a
very
lively
and
disagreeable
recollection
of
this
wind
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
disturbed
region
it
was
only
felt
occasionally
it
then
seemed
to
make
rushes
at
one
particular
man
and
when
it
had
discomfited
him
it
whisked
itself
away
to
some
spot
only
to
return
presently
in
greater
force
than
before
my
old
across
the
basin
of
the
z
muttgletscher
looked
totally
unassailable
do
you
think
the
men
asked
that
you
or
any
one
else
will
ever
get
up
mountain
and
when
undismayed
by
their
ridicule
i
stoutly
answered
yes
but
not
upon
that
side
they
burst
into
derisive
chuckles
i
must
confess
that
my
hopes
sank
for
nothing
can
look
more
completely
inaccessible
than
the
matterhorn
on
its
northern
and
sides
forwards
once
again
we
overtopped
the
dent
d
h√©rens
not
a
thousand
feet
more
in
three
hours
we
shall
be
on
the
you
mean
echoed
croz
so
slow
had
been
the
progress
but
i
was
not
far
wrong
in
the
estimate
at
we
struck
the
great
ridge
followed
by
kennedy
close
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
the
wind
and
cold
were
terrible
there
progress
was
oftentimes
impossible
and
we
waited
crouching
under
the
lee
of
rocks
listening
to
the
shrieking
of
the
mindless
wind
while
the
blasts
swept
across
tearing
off
the
upper
snow
and
blowing
it
away
in
streamers
over
the
sch√∂nb√ºhl
nothing
seen
except
an
indescribable
writhing
in
the
air
like
the
wind
made
our
goal
was
concealed
by
mist
although
it
was
only
a
few
yards
away
and
croz
s
prophecy
that
we
should
stay
all
night
upon
the
summit
seemed
likely
to
come
true
the
men
rose
with
the
occasion
although
even
fingers
had
nearly
lost
sensation
there
were
no
murmurings
nor
suggestions
of
return
and
they
pressed
on
for
the
little
white
cone
which
they
knew
must
be
near
at
hand
stopped
again
a
big
mass
perched
loosely
on
the
ridge
barred
the
way
we
could
not
crawl
over
and
scarcely
dared
creep
round
it
the
wine
went
round
for
the
last
time
the
liquor
was
we
would
more
of
it
it
was
all
gone
the
bottle
was
left
behind
and
we
pushed
on
for
there
was
a
lull
the
end
came
almost
before
it
was
expected
the
clouds
opened
and
i
saw
that
we
were
all
but
upon
the
highest
point
and
that
between
us
and
it
about
twenty
yards
off
there
was
a
little
artificial
pile
of
stones
kennedy
was
a
true
man
was
a
cairn
which
he
had
erected
what
is
that
croz
des
he
bawled
it
was
needless
to
proceed
farther
i
jerked
the
rope
from
biener
and
motioned
that
we
should
go
back
he
did
the
same
to
almer
and
we
turned
immediately
did
not
see
the
stones
they
were
cutting
footsteps
and
misinterpreted
the
reason
of
the
retreat
voices
were
inaudible
and
explanations
impossible
we
commenced
the
descent
of
the
face
it
was
hideous
work
the
men
looked
like
impersonations
of
winter
with
their
hair
all
frosted
and
their
beards
matted
with
ice
my
hands
were
i
begged
the
others
to
stop
can
not
afford
to
stop
we
must
continue
to
was
their
reply
they
were
right
to
stop
was
to
be
entirely
frozen
so
we
went
down
gripping
rocks
varnished
with
ice
which
pulled
the
skin
from
the
fingers
gloves
were
useless
they
became
iced
too
and
the
b√¢tons
slid
through
them
as
slippery
as
eels
the
iron
of
the
axes
stuck
to
the
felt
but
it
was
useless
to
shrink
the
rocks
and
the
axes
had
to
be
firmly
faltering
would
do
here
we
turned
back
at
and
at
crossed
the
bergschrund
again
not
having
halted
for
a
minute
upon
the
entire
descent
during
the
last
two
hours
it
was
windless
but
time
was
of
such
vital
importance
that
we
pressed
on
incessantly
and
did
not
stop
until
we
were
fairly
upon
the
glacier
then
we
took
stock
of
what
remained
of
the
tips
of
our
fingers
there
was
not
much
skin
left
they
were
perfectly
raw
and
for
weeks
afterwards
i
was
reminded
of
the
ascent
of
the
dent
blanche
by
the
twinges
which
i
felt
when
i
pulled
on
my
boots
the
others
escaped
with
some
slight
and
altogether
we
had
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
that
we
got
off
so
lightly
the
men
complimented
me
upon
the
descent
and
i
could
do
the
same
honestly
to
them
if
they
had
worked
less
vigorously
or
harmoniously
we
should
have
been
benighted
upon
the
face
where
there
was
not
a
single
spot
upon
which
it
was
possible
to
sit
and
if
that
had
happened
i
do
not
think
that
one
would
have
survived
to
tell
the
tale
we
made
the
descent
of
the
glacier
in
a
mist
and
of
the
moraine
at
its
base
and
of
the
slopes
below
in
total
darkness
and
regained
the
chalets
of
abricolla
at
we
had
been
absent
eighteen
and
a
half
hours
and
out
of
that
time
had
been
going
not
less
than
seventeen
that
night
we
slept

answered
very
positively
what
do

why
that
you
can
not

my

because
i
didn

make

we
saw
no

it
was
made
by
a

went
up

disgusted
at

expected
to

before
this
happened

managed
to

little
mess
the
pass
which
we
were
about
to
traverse
to
col
d
one
of
the
few
in
this
district
which
have
been
known
almost
from
time
immemorial
it
is
frequently
crossed
in
the
summer
season
and
is
a
very
easy
route
notwithstanding
that
the
summit
of
the
pass
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
from
abricolla
to
the
summit
the
way
lies
chiefly
over
the
flat
glacier
de
ferp√®cle
the
walk
is
of
the
most
straightforward
kind
the
glacier
rises
in
gentle
undulations
its
crevasses
are
small
and
easily
avoided
and
all
you
have
to
do
after
once
getting
upon
the
ice
is
to
proceed
due
south
in
the
most
direct
manner
possible
if
you
do
so
in
two
hours
you
should
be
upon
the
summit
of
the
pass
we
tied
ourselves
in
line
of
course
when
we
entered
upon
the
glacier
and
placed
biener
to
lead
as
he
had
frequently
crossed
the
pass
supposing
that
his
local
knowledge
might
save
us
some
time
upon
the
other
side
we
had
proceeded
i
believe
about
up
when
a
little
thin
cloud
dropped
down
upon
us
from
above
it
was
so
light
and
gauzy
that
we
did
not
for
a
moment
suppose
it
would
become
embarrassing
and
hence
i
neglected
to
note
at
the
proper
moment
the
course
which
we
should
steer
is
to
say
to
observe
our
precise
situation
in
regard
to
the
summit
of
the
pass
for
some
little
time
biener
progressed
steadily
making
a
tolerably
straight
track
but
at
length
he
wavered
and
deviated
sometimes
to
the
right
and
sometimes
to
the
left
croz
rushed
forward
directly
he
saw
this
and
taking
the
poor
young
man
by
his
shoulders
gave
him
a
good
shaking
told
him
that
he
was
an
imbecile
to
untie
himself
at
once
and
to
go
to
the
rear
biener
looked
and
obeyed
without
a
murmur
croz
led
off
briskly
and
made
a
good
straight
track
for
a
few
minutes
then
it
seemed
to
me
he
began
to
move
steadily
round
to
the
left
i
looked
back
but
the
mist
was
now
too
thick
to
see
our
traces
and
so
we
continued
to
follow
our
leader
at
last
the
others
who
were
behind
and
in
a
better
position
to
judge
thought
the
same
as
i
did
and
we
pulled
up
croz
to
deliver
our
opinion
he
took
our
criticism
in
good
part
but
when
biener
opened
his
mouth
that
was
too
much
for
him
to
stand
and
he
told
the
young
man
again
are
imbecile
i
bet
you
twenty
francs
to
one
that
track
is
better
than
twenty
francs
now
then
imbecile
almer
went
to
the
front
he
commenced
by
returning
in
the
track
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
and
then
started
off
at
a
tangent
from
croz
s
curve
we
kept
this
course
for
and
then
were
certain
that
we
were
not
on
the
right
route
because
the
snow
became
decidedly
steep
we
bore
away
more
and
more
to
the
right
to
avoid
this
steep
bank
but
at
last
i
rebelled
as
we
had
for
some
time
been
going
almost
which
was
altogether
the
wrong
direction
after
a
long
discussion
we
returned
some
distance
in
our
track
and
then
steered
a
little
east
of
south
but
we
continually
met
steep
and
to
avoid
them
went
right
or
left
as
the
case
might
require
we
were
greatly
puzzled
and
could
not
in
the
least
tell
whether
we
were
too
near
the
dent
blanche
or
too
close
to
the
t√™te
blanche
the
mists
had
thickened
and
were
now
as
dense
as
a
moderate
london
fog
there
were
no
rocks
or
echoes
to
direct
us
and
the
guidance
of
the
compass
brought
us
invariably
against
these
steep
the
men
were
fairly
beaten
they
had
all
had
a
try
or
more
than
one
and
at
last
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
asked
what
was
to
be
done
it
was
and
only
an
hour
of
daylight
was
left
we
were
beginning
to
feel
used
up
for
we
had
wandered
about
at
speed
for
the
last
three
hours
and
a
half
so
i
said
this
is
my
advice
let
us
turn
in
our
track
and
go
back
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
not
quitting
the
track
for
an
they
were
well
content
but
just
as
we
were
starting
off
the
clouds
lifted
a
little
and
we
thought
we
saw
the
col
it
was
then
to
our
right
and
we
went
at
it
with
a
dash
before
we
had
gone
a
hundred
paces
down
came
the
mist
again
we
kept
on
nevertheless
for
twenty
minutes
and
then
as
darkness
was
perceptibly
coming
on
and
the
snow
was
yet
rising
in
front
we
turned
back
and
by
running
down
the
entire
distance
managed
to
get
clear
of
the
ferp√®cle
glacier
just
as
it
became
pitch
dark
we
arrived
at
our
cheerless
chalet
in
due
course
and
went
to
bed
supperless
for
our
food
was
gone
all
very
to
say
in
nothing
except
in
bullying
biener
at
on
the
we
set
out
for
the
third
time
for
the
col
d
h√©rens
it
was
a
fine
day
and
we
gradually
recovered
our
tempers
as
we
saw
the
follies
which
had
been
committed
on
the
previous
evening
biener
s
wavering
track
was
not
so
bad
but
croz
had
swerved
from
the
right
route
from
the
first
and
had
traced
a
complete
semicircle
so
that
when
we
stopped
him
we
were
facing
we
had
started
almer
had
commenced
with
great
discretion
but
he
kept
on
too
long
and
crossed
the
proper
route
when
i
stopped
them
because
we
were
going
we
were
a
long
way
up
the
t√™te
blanche
our
last
attempt
was
in
the
right
direction
we
were
actually
upon
the
summit
of
the
pass
and
in
another
ten
yards
we
should
have
commenced
to
go
down
hill
it
is
needless
to
point
out
that
if
the
compass
had
been
looked
to
at
the
proper
is
immediately
the
mist
came
should
have
avoided
all
our
troubles
it
was
little
use
afterwards
except
to
tell
us
when
we
were
going
we
arrived
at
zermatt
in
six
and
a
half
hours
walking
from
abricolla
and
seller
s
hospitable
reception
set
us
all
right
again
on
the
we
crossed
the
th√©odule
pass
and
diverged
from
its
summit
up
the
th√©odulhorn
to
examine
a
route
which
i
suggested
for
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
before
continuing
an
account
of
our
proceedings
i
must
stop
for
a
minute
to
explain
why
this
new
route
was
proposed
in
place
of
that
up
the
ridge
the
main
peak
of
the
matterhorn
may
be
divided
into
three
sections
the
first
facing
the
z
muttgletscher
looks
completely
unassailable
the
second
facing
the
east
seems
inaccessibility
itself
whilst
the
third
facing
breil
does
not
look
entirely
hopeless
it
was
from
this
last
direction
that
all
my
previous
attempts
were
made
it
was
by
the
ridge
it
will
be
remembered
that
not
only
i
but
hawkins
professor
tyndall
and
the
chasseurs
of
val
tournanche
essayed
to
climb
the
mountain
why
then
abandon
a
route
which
had
been
shown
to
be
feasible
up
to
a
certain
point
i
gave
it
up
for
four
reasons
on
account
of
my
growing
disinclination
for
ar√™tes
and
preference
for
snow
and
see
chap
because
i
was
persuaded
that
meteorological
disturbances
by
which
we
had
been
baffled
several
times
might
be
expected
to
occur
again
and
again
see
chaps
iv
and
because
i
found
that
the
east
face
was
a
gross
looked
not
far
from
perpendicular
while
its
angle
was
in
fact
scarcely
more
than
because
i
observed
for
myself
that
the
strata
of
the
mountain
dipped
to
the
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
anything
more
than
has
been
already
said
upon
the
first
two
of
these
four
points
but
upon
the
latter
two
a
few
words
are
indispensable
let
us
consider
first
why
most
persons
receive
such
an
exaggerated
impression
of
the
steepness
of
the
eastern
face
illustration
the
matterhorn
from
the
riffelberg
when
one
looks
at
the
matterhorn
from
zermatt
the
mountain
is
regarded
nearly
from
the
the
face
that
fronts
the
east
is
consequently
neither
seen
in
profile
nor
in
full
front
but
almost
between
the
two
it
looks
therefore
more
steep
than
it
really
is
the
majority
of
those
who
visit
zermatt
go
up
to
the
riffelberg
or
to
the
gornergrat
and
from
these
places
the
mountain
naturally
looks
still
more
precipitous
because
its
eastern
face
which
is
almost
all
that
is
seen
of
it
is
viewed
more
directly
in
front
from
the
riffel
hotel
the
slope
seems
to
be
set
at
an
angle
of
if
the
tourist
continues
to
go
southwards
and
crosses
the
th√©odule
pass
he
gets
at
one
point
immediately
in
front
of
the
eastern
face
which
then
seems
to
be
absolutely
perpendicular
comparatively
few
persons
correct
the
erroneous
impressions
they
receive
in
these
quarters
by
studying
the
face
in
profile
and
most
go
away
with
a
very
incorrect
and
exaggerated
idea
of
the
precipitousness
of
this
side
of
the
mountain
because
they
have
considered
the
question
from
one
point
of
view
alone
several
years
passed
away
before
i
shook
myself
clear
of
my
early
and
false
impressions
regarding
the
steepness
of
this
side
of
the
matterhorn
first
of
all
i
noticed
that
there
were
places
on
this
eastern
face
where
snow
remained
permanently
all
the
year
round
i
do
not
speak
of
snow
in
gullies
but
of
the
considerable
slopes
which
are
seen
upon
the
accompanying
engraving
about
up
the
face
such
beds
as
these
could
not
continue
to
remain
throughout
the
summer
unless
the
snow
had
been
able
to
accumulate
in
the
winter
in
large
masses
and
snow
can
not
accumulate
and
remain
in
large
masses
in
a
situation
such
as
this
at
angles
much
exceeding
hence
i
was
bound
to
conclude
that
the
eastern
face
was
many
degrees
removed
from
perpendicularity
and
to
be
sure
on
this
point
i
went
to
the
slopes
between
the
z
muttgletscher
and
the
matterhorngletscher
above
the
chalets
of
staffel
whence
the
face
could
be
seen
in
profile
its
appearance
from
this
direction
would
be
amazing
to
one
who
had
seen
it
only
from
the
east
it
looks
so
totally
different
from
the
apparently
sheer
and
perfectly
unclimbable
cliff
one
sees
from
the
riffelberg
that
it
is
hard
to
believe
the
two
slopes
are
one
and
the
same
thing
its
angle
scarcely
exceeds
a
great
step
was
made
when
this
was
learnt
this
knowledge
alone
would
not
however
have
caused
me
to
try
an
ascent
by
the
eastern
face
instead
of
by
the
ridge
forty
degrees
may
not
seem
a
formidable
inclination
to
the
reader
nor
is
it
for
only
a
small
cliff
but
it
is
very
unusual
to
find
so
steep
a
gradient
maintained
continuously
as
the
general
angle
of
a
great
and
very
few
instances
can
be
quoted
from
the
high
alps
of
such
an
angle
being
preserved
over
a
rise
of
feet
i
do
not
think
that
the
steepness
or
the
height
of
this
cliff
would
have
deterred
climbers
from
attempting
to
ascend
it
if
it
had
not
in
addition
looked
so
repulsively
smooth
men
despaired
of
finding
anything
to
grasp
now
some
of
the
difficulties
of
the
ridge
came
from
the
smoothness
of
the
rocks
although
that
ridge
even
from
a
distance
seemed
to
be
well
broken
up
how
much
greater
then
might
not
have
been
the
difficulty
of
climbing
a
face
which
looked
smooth
and
unbroken
close
at
hand
a
more
serious
hindrance
to
mounting
the
ridge
is
found
in
the
dip
of
its
rocks
to
the
the
great
mass
of
the
matterhorn
it
is
now
well
ascertained
is
composed
of
regularly
stratified
rocks
which
rise
towards
the
east
it
has
been
mentioned
in
the
text
more
than
once
that
the
rocks
on
some
portions
of
the
ridge
leading
from
the
col
du
lion
to
the
summit
dip
outwards
and
that
fractured
edges
overhang
this
is
shown
in
the
illustrations
facing
pp
and
and
the
annexed
diagram
fig
exhibits
the
same
thing
still
more
clearly
it
will
be
readily
understood
that
such
an
arrangement
is
not
favourable
for
climbers
and
that
the
degree
of
facility
with
which
rocks
can
be
ascended
that
are
so
disposed
must
depend
very
much
upon
the
frequency
or
paucity
of
fissures
and
joints
the
rocks
of
the
ridge
are
sufficiently
provided
with
cracks
but
if
it
were
otherwise
their
texture
and
arrangement
would
render
them
unassailable
illustration
diagrams
to
show
dip
of
strata
on
the
matterhorn
it
is
not
possible
to
go
a
single
time
upon
the
rocks
of
the
ridge
from
the
col
du
lion
to
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
without
observing
the
prevalence
of
their
outward
dip
and
that
their
fractured
edges
have
a
tendency
to
overhang
nor
can
one
fail
to
notice
that
it
is
upon
this
account
the
d√©bris
which
is
rent
off
by
frost
does
not
remain
but
pours
down
in
showers
over
the
surrounding
cliffs
each
day
s
work
so
to
speak
is
cleared
away
the
ridge
is
swept
clean
there
is
scarcely
anything
seen
but
firm
rock
the
fact
that
the
mountain
is
composed
of
a
series
of
stratified
beds
was
pointed
out
long
ago
de
saussure
remarked
it
and
recorded
explicitly
in
his
that
they
rose
to
the
at
an
angle
of
about
forbes
noticed
it
also
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
beds
were
less
inclined
or
nearly
he
added
de
saussure
is
no
doubt
the
truth
i
think
lies
between
the
two
i
was
acquainted
with
both
of
the
passages
but
did
not
turn
the
knowledge
to
any
practical
account
until
i
the
same
fact
for
myself
it
was
not
until
after
my
repulse
in
that
i
referred
the
peculiar
difficulties
of
the
ridge
to
the
dip
of
the
strata
but
when
once
persuaded
that
structure
and
not
texture
was
the
real
impediment
it
was
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
opposite
side
that
is
to
say
the
eastern
face
might
be
comparatively
easy
in
brief
that
an
arrangement
should
be
found
like
fig
instead
of
like
fig
this
trivial
deduction
was
the
key
to
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
the
point
was
did
the
strata
continue
with
a
similar
dip
throughout
the
mountain
if
they
did
then
this
great
eastern
face
instead
of
being
hopelessly
impracticable
should
be
quite
the
fact
it
should
be
a
great
natural
staircase
with
steps
inclining
inwards
and
if
it
were
so
its
smooth
aspect
might
be
of
no
account
for
the
smallest
steps
inclined
in
this
fashion
would
afford
good
footing
they
did
so
as
far
as
one
could
judge
from
a
distance
when
snow
fell
in
the
summer
time
it
brought
out
long
terraced
lines
upon
the
mountain
rudely
parallel
to
each
other
inclined
in
the
direction
shown
approximately
upon
the
figures
in
the
accompanying
plate
and
the
eastern
face
on
those
occasions
was
often
whitened
almost
completely
over
while
the
other
sides
with
the
exception
of
the
powdered
terraces
remained
the
snow
could
not
rest
upon
them

the
matterhorn
from
the
the
spaces
between
the
parallel
red
lines
represent
on
an
average
a
vertical
height
of
about
feet
but
on
account
of
foreshortening
the
height
between
the
uppermost
lines
is
somewhat
more
than
this
amount
the
very
outline
of
the
mountain
too
confirmed
the
conjecture
that
its
structure
would
assist
an
ascent
on
the
eastern
face
although
it
opposed
one
on
all
other
sides
look
at
any
photograph
of
the
peak
from
the
or
failing
one
the
outline
facing
page
which
is
carefully
traced
from
one
and
you
will
see
that
upon
the
side
that
facing
the
z
muttgletscher
there
is
an
incessant
repetition
of
overhanging
cliffs
and
of
slopes
all
trending
downwards
in
short
that
the
character
of
the
whole
of
that
side
is
similar
to
fig
and
that
upon
the
left
hand

ridge
the
forms
as
far
as
they
go
are
suggestive
of
the
structure
of
fig
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
contours
of
the
mountain
seen
from
this
direction
have
been
largely
influenced
by
the
direction
of
its
beds
it
was
not
therefore
from
a
freak
that
i
invited
reilly
to
join
in
an
attack
upon
the
eastern
face
but
from
a
conviction
that
it
would
prove
to
give
the
easiest
path
to
the
summit
and
if
we
had
not
been
obliged
to
part
the
mountain
would
doubtless
have
been
ascended
in
my
guides
readily
admitted
that
they
had
been
greatly
deceived
as
to
the
steepness
of
the
eastern
face
when
they
were
halted
to
look
at
it
in
profile
as
we
came
down
the
z
muttgletscher
on
our
way
to
zermatt
but
they
were
far
from
being
satisfied
that
it
would
turn
out
to
be
easy
to
climb
and
almer
and
biener
expressed
themselves
decidedly
averse
to
making
an
attempt
upon
it
i
gave
way
temporarily
before
their
evident
reluctance
and
we
made
the
ascent
of
the
th√©odulhorn
to
examine
an
alternative
route
which
i
expected
would
commend
itself
to
them
in
preference
to
the
other
as
a
great
part
of
it
led
over
snow
there
is
an
immense
gully
in
the
matterhorn
which
leads
up
from
the
glacier
du
mont
cervin
to
a
point
high
up
on
the
ridge
i
proposed
to
ascend
this
to
its
head
and
to
cross
over
the
ridge
on
to
the
eastern
face
this
would
have
brought
us
on
a
level
with
the
bottom
of
the
great
shown
upon
the
centre
of
the
eastern
face
in
the
engraving
facing
this
was
to
be
crossed
diagonally
with
the
view
of
arriving
at
the
snow
upon
the
ridge
which
is
shown
upon
the
same
engraving
about
from
the
summit
the
remainder
of
the
ascent
was
to
be
made
by
the
broken
rocks
mixed
with
snow
upon
the
north
side
of
the
mountain
croz
caught
the
idea
immediately
and
thought
the
plan
feasible
details
were
settled
and
we
descended
to
breil
luc
meynet
the
hunchback
was
summoned
and
expressed
himself
delighted
to
resume
his
old
vocation
of
and
favre
s
kitchen
was
soon
in
commotion
preparing
three
days
rations
for
i
intended
to
take
that
amount
of
time
over
the
sleep
on
the
first
night
upon
the
rocks
at
the
top
of
the
gully
to
make
a
push
for
the
summit
and
to
return
to
the
tent
on
the
second
day
and
upon
the
third
to
come
back
to
breil
we
started
at
on
june
and
followed
the
route
of
the
breuiljoch
for
three
hours
we
were
then
in
full
view
of
our
gully
and
turned
off
at
right
angles
for
it
the
closer
we
approached
the
more
favourable
did
it
look
there
was
a
good
deal
of
snow
in
it
which
was
evidently
at
a
small
angle
and
it
seemed
as
if
of
the
ascent
at
least
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
some
suspicious
marks
in
the
snow
at
its
base
suggested
that
it
was
not
free
from
falling
stones
and
as
a
measure
of
precaution
we
turned
off
on
one
side
worked
up
under
cover
of
the
cliffs
and
waited
to
see
if
anything
should
descend
nothing
fell
so
we
proceeded
up
its
right
or
northern
side
sometimes
cutting
steps
up
the
snow
and
sometimes
mounting
by
the
rocks
shortly
before
we
arrived
at
a
convenient
place
for
a
halt
and
stopped
to
rest
upon
some
rocks
immediately
close
to
the
snow
which
commanded
an
excellent
view
of
the
gully
while
the
men
were
unpacking
the
food
i
went
to
a
little
promontory
to
examine
our
proposed
route
more
narrowly
and
to
admire
our
noble
couloir
which
led
straight
up
into
the
heart
of
the
mountain
for
fully
one
thousand
feet
it
then
bent
towards
the
north
and
ran
up
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
my
curiosity
was
piqued
to
know
what
was
round
this
corner
and
whilst
i
was
gazing
up
at
it
and
following
with
the
eye
the
exquisitely
drawn
curves
which
wandered
down
the
snow
in
the
gully
all
converging
to
a
large
rut
in
its
centre
i
saw
a
few
little
stones
skidding
down
i
consoled
myself
with
thinking
that
they
would
not
interfere
with
us
if
we
adhered
to
the
side
but
then
a
larger
one
came
down
a
solitary
fellow
rushing
at
the
rate
of
sixty
miles
an
another
i
was
unwilling
to
raise
the
fears
of
the
men
unnecessarily
and
said
nothing
to
them
they
did
not
hear
the
stones
almer
was
seated
on
a
rock
carving
large
slices
from
a
leg
of
mutton
the
others
were
chatting
and
the
first
intimation
they
had
of
danger
was
from
a
sudden
reverberated
awfully
amongst
the
cliffs
and
looking
up
they
saw
masses
of
rocks
boulders
and
stones
big
and
little
dart
round
the
corner
eight
hundred
feet
or
so
above
us
fly
with
fearful
fury
against
the
opposite
cliffs
rebound
from
them
against
the
walls
on
our
side
and
descend
some
ricochetting
from
side
to
side
in
a
frantic
manner
some
bounding
down
in
leaps
of
a
hundred
feet
or
more
over
the
snow
and
others
trailing
down
in
a
jumbled
confused
mass
mixed
with
snow
and
ice
deepening
the
grooves
which
a
moment
before
had
excited
my
admiration
the
men
looked
wildly
around
for
protection
and
dropping
the
food
dashed
under
cover
in
all
directions
the
precious
mutton
was
pitched
on
one
side
the
was
let
fall
and
its
contents
gushed
out
from
the
unclosed
neck
whilst
all
four
cowered
under
defending
rocks
endeavouring
to
make
themselves
as
small
as
possible
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
their
fright
was
unreasonable
or
that
i
was
free
from
it
i
took
good
care
to
make
myself
safe
and
went
and
cringed
in
a
cleft
until
the
storm
had
passed
but
their
scramble
to
get
under
shelter
was
indescribably
ludicrous
such
a
panic
i
have
never
witnessed
before
or
since
upon
a
this
ricochet
practice
was
a
novelty
to
me
it
arose
of
course
from
the
couloir
being
bent
and
from
the
falling
rocks
having
acquired
great
pace
before
they
passed
the
angle
in
straight
gullies
it
will
probably
never
be
experienced
the
rule
is
as
i
have
already
remarked
that
falling
stones
keep
down
the
centres
of
gullies
and
they
are
out
of
harm
s
way
if
one
follows
the
sides
illustration
my
hunchback
there
would
have
been
singularly
little
amusement
and
very
great
risk
in
mounting
this
gully
and
we
turned
our
backs
upon
it
with
perfect
unanimity
the
question
then
arose
what
is
to
be
done
i
suggested
climbing
the
rocks
above
us
but
this
was
voted
impossible
i
thought
the
men
were
right
yet
would
not
give
in
without
being
assured
of
the
fact
and
clambered
up
to
settle
the
question
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
brought
to
a
halt
my
forces
were
scattered
the
little
hunchback
alone
was
closely
following
a
broad
grin
upon
his
face
and
the
tent
upon
his
shoulder
croz
more
behind
was
still
keeping
an
eye
upon
his
almer
a
hundred
feet
below
sat
on
a
rock
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
biener
was
nowhere
out
of
sight
come
down
come
down
shouted
croz
it
is
useless
and
i
turned
at
length
convinced
that
it
was
even
as
he
said
thus
my
little
plan
was
knocked
on
the
head
and
we
were
thrown
back
upon
the
original
scheme
we
at
once
made
a
straight
track
for
morshead
s
breuiljoch
which
was
the
most
direct
route
to
take
in
order
to
get
to
the
h√∂rnli
where
we
intended
to
sleep
preparatory
to
attacking
the
eastern
face
and
arrived
upon
its
summit
at
we
were
then
unexpectedly
checked
the
pass
as
one
had
vanished
and
we
found
ourselves
cut
off
from
the
furggengletscher
by
a
small
but
precipitous
wall
of
rock
glacier
had
shrunk
so
much
that
descent
was
impracticable
during
the
last
hour
clouds
had
been
coming
up
from
the
south
they
now
surrounded
us
and
it
began
to
blow
hard
the
men
clustered
together
and
advocated
leaving
the
mountain
alone
almer
asked
with
more
point
than
politeness
why
don
t
you
try
to
go
up
a
mountain
which
be
ascended
it
is
impossible
chimed
in
biener
sir
said
croz
if
we
cross
to
the
other
side
we
shall
lose
three
days
and
very
likely
shall
not
succeed
you
want
to
make
ascents
in
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
and
i
believe
they
can
be
made
but
i
shall
not
be
able
to
make
them
with
you
if
i
spend
these
days
here
for
i
must
be
at
chamounix
on
the
there
was
force
in
what
he
said
and
his
words
made
me
hesitate
i
relied
upon
his
strong
arms
for
some
work
which
it
was
expected
would
be
unusually
difficult
snow
began
to
fall
that
settled
the
matter
and
i
gave
the
word
to
retreat
we
went
back
to
breil
and
on
to
the
village
of
val
tournanche
where
we
slept
and
the
next
day
proceeded
to
chatillon
and
thence
up
the
valley
of
aosta
to
courmayeur
i
can
not
but
regret
that
the
counsels
of
the
guides
prevailed
if
croz
had
not
uttered
his
words
he
might
still
have
been
living
he
parted
from
us
at
chamounix
at
the
appointed
time
but
by
a
strange
chance
we
met
again
at
zermatt
three
weeks
later
and
two
days
afterwards
he
perished
before
my
eyes
on
the
very
mountain
from
which
we
turned
away
at
his
advice
on
the
of
june
on
june
we
mounted
to
the
top
of
mont
saxe
to
scan
the
grandes
jorasses
with
the
view
of
ascending
it
five
thousand
feet
of
precipices
rose
above
us
and
up
all
that
height
we
tracked
a
way
to
our
satisfaction
three
thousand
feet
more
of
glacier
and
slopes
lay
beneath
and
there
was
only
one
point
at
which
it
was
doubtful
if
we
should
find
a
path
the
glaciers
were
shrinking
and
were
surrounded
by
bastions
of
rounded
rock
far
too
polished
to
please
the
rough
mountaineer
we
could
not
track
a
way
across
them
however
at
the
next
day
under
the
dexterous
leading
of
michel
croz
we
passed
the
doubtful
spot
thence
it
was
all
plain
sailing
and
at
we
gained
the
summit
the
weather
was
boisterous
in
the
upper
regions
and
driven
before
the
wind
and
wrecked
against
our
heights
enveloped
us
in
misty
spray
which
danced
around
and
fled
away
which
cut
us
off
from
the
material
universe
and
caused
us
to
be
as
it
were
suspended
betwixt
heaven
and
earth
seeing
both
occasionally
but
seeming
to
belong
to
neither
the
mists
lasted
longer
than
my
patience
and
we
descended
without
having
attained
the
object
for
which
the
ascent
was
made
at
first
we
followed
the
little
ridge
shown
upon
the
accompanying
engraving
leading
from
our
summit
towards
the
spectator
and
then
took
to
the
head
of
the
corridor
of
glacier
on
its
left
which
in
the
view
is
left
perfectly
white
the
slopes
were
steep
and
covered
with
snow
and
evil
to
tread
upon
on
the
ascent
we
had
reviled
it
and
had
made
our
staircase
with
much
caution
knowing
full
well
that
the
disturbance
of
its
base
would
bring
down
all
that
was
above
in
descending
the
bolder
spirits
counselled
trusting
to
luck
and
a
glissade
the
cautious
ones
advocated
avoiding
the
slopes
and
crossing
to
the
rocks
on
their
farther
side
the
advice
of
the
latter
prevailed
and
we
had
the
snow
to
gain
the
ridge
when
the
crust
slipped
and
we
went
along
with
it
halt
broke
from
all
four
unanimously
the
flew
round
as
we
started
on
this
involuntary
glissade
it
was
useless
they
slid
over
the
underlying
ice
fruitlessly
halt
thundered
croz
as
he
dashed
his
weapon
in
again
with
superhuman
energy
no
halt
could
be
made
and
we
slid
down
slowly
but
with
accelerating
motion
driving
up
waves
of
snow
in
front
with
streams
of
the
nasty
stuff
hissing
all
around
luckily
the
slope
eased
off
at
one
place
the
leading
men
cleverly
jumped
aside
out
of
the
moving
snow
we
others
followed
and
the
young
avalanche
which
we
had
started
continuing
to
pour
down
fell
into
a
yawning
crevasse
and
showed
us
where
our
grave
would
have
been
if
we
had
remained
in
its
company
five
seconds
longer
the
whole
affair
did
not
occupy
it
was
the
solitary
incident
of
a
long
day
and
at
nightfall
we
the
excellent
house
kept
by
the
courteous
bertolini
well
satisfied
that
we
had
not
met
with
more
incidents
of
a
similar

the
first
passage
of
the
col
dolent
men
willingly
believe
what
they
freethinking
mountaineers
have
been
latterly
in
the
habit
of
going
up
one
side
of
an
alp
and
coming
down
the
other
and
calling
the
route
a
pass
in
this
confusion
of
ideas
may
be
recognised
the
result
of
the
looseness
of
thought
which
arises
from
the
absence
of
technical
education
the
true
believer
abhors
such
heresies
and
observes
with
satisfaction
that
providence
oftentimes
punishes
the
offenders
for
their
greediness
by
causing
them
to
be
benighted
the
faithful
know
that
passes
must
be
made
mountains
and
not
over
their
tops
their
creed
declares
that
between
any
two
mountains
there
be
a
pass
and
they
believe
that
the
end
for
which
big
peaks
were
office
they
are
especially
designed
to
to
point
out
the
way
one
should
go
this
is
the
true
faith
and
there
is
no
other
we
set
out
upon
the
of
june
to
endeavour
to
add
one
more
to
the
passes
which
are
strictly
orthodox
we
hoped
rather
than
expected
to
discover
a
quicker
route
from
courmayeur
to
chamounix
than
the
col
du
g√©ant
which
was
the
easiest
quickest
and
most
direct
pass
known
at
the
time
across
the
main
chain
of
mont
blanc
the
misgivings
which
i
had
as
to
the
result
caused
us
to
start
at
the
unusual
hour
of
at
we
passed
the
chalets
of
pr√®
du
bar
and
thence
for
some
distance
followed
the
track
which
we
had
made
upon
the
ascent
of
mont
dolent
over
the
glacier
of
the
same
name
at
a
quarter
past
we
arrived
at
the
head
of
the
glacier
and
at
the
foot
of
the
only
steep
gradient
upon
the
whole
of
the
ascent
it
was
the
of
a
pass
there
was
a
gap
in
the
mountains
with
a
big
peak
on
each
side
mount
dolent
and
the
aig
de
triolet
a
narrow
thread
of
snow
led
up
to
the
lowest
point
between
those
mountains
and
the
blue
sky
beyond
said
directly
you
arrive
here
you
will
begin
to
go
down
we
addressed
ourselves
to
our
task
and
at
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
pass
had
things
gone
as
they
ought
within
six
hours
more
we
should
have
been
at
chamounix
upon
the
other
side
we
knew
that
there
was
a
couloir
in
correspondence
with
that
up
which
we
had
just
come
if
it
had
been
filled
with
snow
all
would
have
been
well
it
turned
out
to
be
filled
with
ice
croz
who
led
passed
over
to
the
other
side
and
reported
that
we
should
get
down
somehow
but
i
knew
from
the
sound
of
his
axe
how
the
somehow
would
be
and
settled
myself
to
sketch
well
assured
that
should
not
be
wanted
for
an
hour
to
come
what
i
saw
is
shown
in
the
engraving
a
sharp
aiguille
nameless
perhaps
the
sharpest
in
the
whole
range
backed
on
the
left
by
the
aig
de
triolet
queer
blocks
of
probably
protogine
sticking
out
awkwardly
through
the
snow
and
a
huge
cornice
from
which
big
icicles
depended
that
broke
away
occasionally
and
went
skiddling
down
the
slope
up
which
we
had
come
of
the
argenti√®re
side
i
could
not
see
anything
croz
was
tied
up
with
our
good
manilla
rope
and
the
whole
feet
were
payed
out
gradually
by

he
ceased
working
after
two
hours
incessant
toil

was

anchor
himself

then
untied
himself
the

was
attached
to

went
down
to
join
his
comrade
there
was
then
room
enough
for
me
to
stand
by
the
side
of
almer
and
i
got
my
first
view
of
the
other
side
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
my
life
i
looked
down
a
slope
more
than
a
thousand
feet
long
set
at
an
angle
of
about
which
was
a
sheet
of
ice
from
top
to
bottom
it
was
unbroken
by
rock
or
crag
and
anything
thrown
down
it
sped
away
unarrested
until
the
level
of
the
glacier
d
argenti√®re
was
reached
the
entire
basin
of
that
noble
glacier
was
spread
out
at
our
feet
and
the
ridge
beyond
culminating
in
the
aig
d
argenti√®re
was
seen
to
the
greatest
advantage
i
confess
however
that
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
the
view
for
there
was
no
time
to
indulge
in
such
luxuries
i
descended
the
icy
staircase
and
joined
the
others
and
then
we
three
drew
in
the
rope
tenderly
as
almer
came
down
his
was
not
an
enviable
position
but
he
descended
with
as
much
steadiness
as
if
his
whole
life
had
been
passed
on
of
the
process
was
repeated
croz
again
going
to
the
front
and
availing
himself
very
skilfully
of
the
rocks
which
projected
from
the
cliff
on
our
right
our
feet
of
rope
again
came
to
an
end
and
we
again
descended
one
by
one
from
this
point
we
were
able
to
clamber
down
by
the
rocks
alone
for
about
feet
they
then
became
sheer
cliff
and
we
stopped
for
dinner
about
at
the
last
place
upon
which
we
could
sit
four
hours
incessant
work
had
brought
us
rather
more
than
down
the
gully
we
were
now
approaching
although
we
were
still
high
above
the
schrunds
at
its
base
and
the
guides
made
out
in
some
way
unknown
to
me
that
nature
had
perversely
placed
the
only
across
the
topmost
one
towards
the
centre
of
the
gully
it
was
decided
to
cut
diagonally
across
the
gully
to
the
point
where
the
was
supposed
to
be
almer
and
biener
undertook
the
work
leaving
croz
and
myself
firmly
planted
on
the
rocks

pay
out
the

them

they
are
frequently
spoken
of

such
as
that
to
which
i
refer
are
rarely
seen
and
still
more
seldom
traversed
it
is
however
always
possible
that
they
may
be
encountered
and
on
this
account
if
for
no
other
it
is
necessary
for
men
who
go
mountaineering
to
be
armed
with
and
with
good
ones
the
form
is
of
more
importance
than
might
be
supposed
of
course
if
you
intend
to
act
as
a
simple
amateur

let
others
do
the
work

only
follow
in
their
steps

importance

kind
of
you
carry

does
not
fall
off
or
otherwise
behave
itself

there
is
no
better
weapon
for
cutting
steps
in
ice
than
a
common
and
the
form
of
which
is
now
usually
employed
by
the
best

is
very
like

is
principally
used
for
cutting
in

apart
from
its
value
as
a
cutting
weapon
it
is
invaluable
as
a
grapnel
it
is
naturally
a
rather
awkward
implement
when
it
is

to
give
rise
to
much

if

he
may
be

most
likely
take
the
entire

to
the
chance
of
broken
necks
there
will
be
a
strong
probability
that
some
at

will
be
smothered
by
the
dislodged

such
accidents
are
far
too
common
and
their
occurrence
as
a
rule
may
be
traced
to
the
want
of

is
induced

came
to
the
conclusion

an
ascent
could
more
easily
be
made
from
the
south

the

over

the

were
still
flowing
along
the
surface

the

cutting
deep
troughs
where
the
gradients
were
small

where
the

confined

falling

walking

brought
us
up

than
feet
and
within
about

of

direction
can
it
be
approached
so
closely
with
equal
facility
thence
the
mountain

after
his
late
severe
piece
of
almer
had
a
natural
inclination
for
rocks
but
the
lower
rocks
of
the
final
peak
of
the
verte
were
not
inviting
and
he
went
on
and
on
looking
for
a
way
up
them
until
we
arrived
in

of
a
great

couloir
that
led
from

right
up
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
connecting
the
summit

the

with

mountain
called

this
was
the
route
which
i
intended
to
be
taken
but
almer
pointed
out
that
the
gully
narrowed
at
the
lower
part
and
that
if
stones
fell
we
should
stand
some
chance
of
getting
our
heads
broken
and
so
we
went
on
still
more
to
the
east
of
the
summit
to
another
and
smaller
couloir
which
ran
up
side

crossed

protected

from
becoming

there
is

goodness
to
be

pebbles
but
you
can
not
suck
them
and
keep
the
mouth
open
at
the

time
and
hence
the
throat
does
not
become
dry
it
answers
just
as
well
to
keep
the
mouth
shut
without
any
pebbles
inside
i
think
better
for
if
you
have
occasion
to
open
your
mouth
you
can
do
so
without
swallowing
any
pebbles
as
a

amateurs
and
particularly
novices
keep
their

shut
they
attempt
to
force
the
pace
they
go
faster
than
they
can
go
without
being
compelled
to
open
their
mouths
to
breathe
they
pant
their
throats
and
tongues
become
parched
they
drink
and
perspire
copiously

becoming
exhausted

that
the
dryness
of
the

the

of

as
it
was
filled
with
snow
at
last
ice
replaced
snow
and
we
turned
over
to
the
rocks
upon
its
left
charming
rocks
they
were
granitic
in
texture
gritty
holding
the
nails
well
at
we
parted
from
them
and
completed
the
ascent
by
a
little
ridge
of
snow
which
descended
in
the
direction
of
the
aiguille
du
moine
at
we
stood
on
the
summit
and
devoured
our
bread
and
cheese
with
a
good
appetite
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
disappointing
nature
of
purely
panoramic
views
that
seen
from
mont
blanc
itself
is
notoriously
unsatisfactory
when
you
are
upon
that
summit
you
look
down
upon
all
the
rest
of
europe
there
is
nothing
to
look
up
to
all
is
below
there
is
no
one
point
for
the
eye
to
rest
upon
the
man
who
is
there
is
somewhat
in
the
position
of
one
who
has
attained
all
that
he
desires
has
nothing
to
aspire
to
his
position
must
needs
be
unsatisfactory
upon
the
summit
of
the
verte
there
is
not
this
objection
you
see
valleys
villages
fields
you
see
mountains
interminable
rolling
away
lakes
resting
in
their
hollows
you
hear
the
tinkling
of
the
as
it
rises
through
the
clear
mountain
air
and
the
roar
of
the
avalanches
as
they
descend
to
the
valleys
but
above
all
there
is
the
great
white
dome
with
its
shining
crest
high
above
with
its
sparkling
glaciers
that
descend
between
buttresses
which
support
them
with
its
brilliant
snows
purer
and
yet
purer
the
farther
they
are
removed
from
this
unclean
world
even
upon
this
it
was
impossible
to
forget
the
world
for
some
vile
wretch
came
to
the
jardin
and
made
hideous
sounds
by
blowing
through
a
horn
whilst
we
were
denouncing
him
a
change
came
over
the
weather
cumulous
clouds
gathered
in
all
directions
and
we
started
off
in
hot
haste
snow
began
to
fall
heavily
before
we
were
off
the
our
track
was
obscured
and
frequently
lost
and
everything
became
so
sloppy
and
slippery
that
the
descent
took
as
long
as
the
ascent
the
schrund
was
recrossed
at
and
thence
we
raced
down
to
the
couvercle
intending
to
have
a
carouse
there
but
as
we
rounded
our
rock
a
howl
broke
simultaneously
from
all
three
of
us
for
the
porter
had
taken
down
the
tent
and
was
in
the
act
of
moving
off
with
it
stop
there
what
are
you
doing
he
observed
that
he
had
thought
we
were
killed
or
at
least
lost
and
was
going
to
chamounix
to
communicate
his
ideas
to
the
unfasten
the
tent
and
get
out
the
instead
of
doing
so
the
porter
fumbled
in
his
pockets
get
out
the
food
we
roared
losing
all
patience
here
it
is
said
our
worthy
friend
producing
a
dirty
piece
of
bread
about
as
big
as
a
halfpenny
roll
we
three
looked
solemnly
at
the
morsel
it
was
past
a
joke
had
devoured
everything
mutton
loaves
cheese
wine
eggs
was
recovery
it
was
idle
to
grumble
and
useless
to
wait
we
were
light
and
could
move
quickly
porter
was
laden
inside
and
out
we
went
our
hardest
had
to
shuffle
and
trot
he
streamed
with
perspiration
the
mutton
and
cheese
oozed
out
in
big
drops
larded
the
glacier
we
had
our
revenge
and
dried
our
clothes
at
the
same
time
but
when
we
arrived
at
the
montanvert
the
porter
was
as
wet
as
we
had
been
upon
our
arrival
at
the
couvercle
we
halted
at
the
inn
to
get
a
little
food
and
at
a
quarter
past
eight
chamounix
amidst
firing
of
cannon
and
other
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
one
would
have
thought
that
the
ascent
of
this
mountain
which
had
been
frequently
assailed
before
without
success
would
have
afforded
some
gratification
to
a
population
whose
chief
support
is
derived
from
tourists
and
that
the
prospect
of
the
perennial
flow
of
francs
which
might
be
expected
to
result
from
it
would
have
stifled
the
jealousy
consequent
on
the
success
of
foreigners
it
was
not
so
chamounix
stood
on
its
rights
a
stranger
had
ignored
the
regulations
had
imported
two
foreign
guides
and
furthermore
he
had
added
injury
to
that
had
not
taken
a
single
chamounix
guide
chamounix
would
be
revenged
it
would
bully
the
foreign
guides
it
would
tell
them
they
had
lied
they
had
not
made
the
ascent
where
were
their
proofs
where
was
the
flag
upon
the
summit
poor
almer
and
biener
were
accordingly
chivied
from
pillar
to
post
from
one
inn
to
another
and
at
length
complained
to
me
peter
perrn
the
zermatt
guide
said
on
the
night
that
we
returned
that
this
was
to
happen
but
the
story
seemed
too
absurd
to
be
true
i
now
bade
my
men
go
out
again
and
followed
them
myself
to
see
the
sport
chamounix
was
greatly
excited
the
of
the
was
thronged
with
clamouring
men
their
zacharie
guide
of
no
particular
merit
but
not
a
bad
fellow
was
haranguing
the
multitude
he
met
with
more
than
his
match
my
friend
kennedy
who
was
on
the
spot
heard
of
the
disturbance
and
rushed
into
the
fray
confronted
the
burly
guide
and
thrust
back
his
absurdities
into
his
teeth
there
were
the
materials
for
a
very
pretty
riot
but
they
manage
these
things
better
in
france
than
we
do
and
the
down
and
dispersed
the
crowd
the
guides
quailed
before
the
cocked
hats
and
retired
to
cabarets
to
take
little
glasses
of
absinthe
and
other
liquors
more
or
less
injurious
to
the
human
frame
under
the
influence
of
these
stimulants
they
conceived
an
idea
which
combined
revenge
with
profit
you
have
ascended
the
aiguille
verte
you
say
say
we
don
t
believe
it
say
do
it
again
take
three
of
us
with
you
and
we
will
bet
you
two
thousand
francs
to
one
thousand
that
you
won
t
make
the
ascent
this
proposition
was
formally
notified
to
me
but
i
declined
it
with
thanks
and
recommended
kennedy
to
go
in
and
win
i
accepted
however
a
hundred
franc
share
in
the
bet
and
calculated
upon
getting
two
hundred
per
cent
on
my
investment
alas
how
vain
are
human
expectations
zacharie
cachat
was
put
into
confinement
and
although
kennedy
actually
ascended
the
aiguille
a
week
later
with
two
chamounix
guides
and
peter
perrn
the
bet
came
to
nothing
the
weather
arranged
itself
just
as
this
storm
in
a
teapot
blew
over
and
we
left
at
once
for
the
montanvert
in
order
to
show
the
chamouniards
the
easiest
way
over
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
in
return
for
the
civilities
which
we
had
received
from
them
during
the
past
three
days

more
by

than

the
person
who
discovered
the

must
have
been
a
shrewd
mountaineer
the

was
in
use
before
any

was
known
across
the
main
chain
of
mont

and
down
to
the
present
time
it
remains
the
easiest
and
quickest
route
from
chamounix
to
courmayeur
with
the
single
exception
of
the
pass
that
we
crossed
upon
the
of
july
for
the
first
time
which
lies
about
between
the
aiguille
de

and
the
aiguille
de

and
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
have
called
the

when
one
looks
toward
the
upper
end
of

from
the
direction
of

or
of
the

the

bounds

seems
to
be
of
little
elevation
it
is
overpowered
by
the
colossal
grandes

and
by
the
almost
equally
magnificent
aiguille

the
ridge
notwithstanding
is
by
no
means
despicable
at
no
point
is
its
elevation
less
than
feet
it
does
not
look
anything
like
this
height
the

mounts
with
a
steady
incline
and
the
eye
is
completely
deceived
in
when
prowling
about
with
reilly
i
instinctively
fixed
upon
a
bent
couloir
which
led
up
from
the
glacier
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
ridge
and
when
after
crossing
the
col
de
triolet
i
saw
that
the
other
side
presented
no
particular
difficulty
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
the
point
in
the
whole
of
the
range
which
would
afford
an
easier
passage
than
the
col
du
g√©ant
we
set
out
from
the
montanvert
at
upon
july
to
see
whether
this
opinion
was
correct
and
it
fortunately
happened
that
the
rev
girdlestone
and
a
friend
with
two
chamounix
guides
left
the
inn
at
the
same
hour
as
ourselves
to
cross
the
col
du
g√©ant
we
kept
in
company
as
far
as
our
routes
lay
together
and
at
we
arrived
at
the
top
of
our
pass
having
taken
the
route
to
the
south
of
the
jardin
description
is
unnecessary
as
our
track
is
laid
down
very
clearly
on
the
engraving
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
much
snow
had
fallen
during
the
late
bad
weather
and
as
we
reposed
upon
the
top
of
our
pass
which
was
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
feet
above
the
col
du
g√©ant
we
saw
that
the
descent
of
the
rocks
which
intervened
between
us
and
the
glacier
de
triolet
would
require
some
caution
for
the
sun
s
rays
poured
down
directly
upon
them
and
the
snow
slipped
away
every
now
and
then
from
ledge
to
ledge
just
as
if
it
had
been
water
cascades
not
large
enough
to
be
imposing
but
sufficient
to
knock
us
over
if
we
got
in
their
way
this
little
bit
of
cliff
consequently
took
a
longer
time
than
it
should
have
done
for
when
we
heard
the
indescribable
swishing
hissing
sound
which
announced
a
coming
fall
we
of
necessity
huddled
under
the
lee
of
the
rocks
until
the
snow
ceased
to
shoot
over
us
we
got
to
the
level
of
the
glacier
de
triolet
without
misadventure
then
steered
for
its
left
bank
to
avoid
the
upper
of
its
two
formidable
and
after
descending
the
requisite
distance
by
some
old
snow
lying
between
the
glacier
and
the
cliffs
which
border
it
crossed
directly
to
the
right
bank
over
the
level
ice
between
the
two
the
right
bank
was
gained
without
any
trouble
and
we
found
there
numerous
beds
of
hard
snow
avalanche
d√©bris
down
which
we
could
run
or
glissade
as
fast
as
we
liked
glissading
is
a
very
pleasant
employment
when
it
is
accomplished
successfully
and
i
have
never
seen
a
place
where
it
can
be
more
safely
indulged
in
than
the
snowy
valley
on
the
right
bank
of
the
glacier
de
triolet
in
my
dreams
i
glissade
delightfully
but
in
practice
i
find
that
somehow
the
snow
will
not
behave
properly
and
that
my
alpenstock
get
between
my
legs
then
my
legs
go
where
my
head
should
be
and
i
see
the
sky
revolving
at
a
rapid
pace
the
snow
rises
up
and
smites
me
and
runs
away
and
when
it
is
at
last
overtaken
it
suddenly
stops
and
we
come
into
violent
collision
those
who
are
with
me
say
that
i
tumble
head
over
heels
and
there
may
be
some
truth
in
what
they
say
streaks
of
ice
are
apt
to
make
the
heels
shoot
away
and
stray
stones
cause
one
to
pitch
headlong
down
somehow
these
things
always
seem
to
come
in
the
way
so
it
is
as
well
to
glissade
only
when
there
is
something
soft
to
tumble
into
illustration
glissading
near
the
termination
of
the
glacier
we
could
not
avoid
traversing
a
portion
of
its
abominable
moraine
but
at
we
were
clear
of
it
and
threw
ourselves
upon
some
springy
turf
conscious
that
our
day
s
work
was
over
an
hour
afterwards
we
resumed
the
march
crossed
the
doire
torrent
by
a
bridge
a
little
below
gruetta
and
at
five
o
clock
entered
courmayeur
having
occupied
somewhat
less
than
ten
hours
on
the
way
girdlestone
s
party
came
in
i
believe
about
four
hours
afterwards
so
there
was
no
doubt
that
we
made
a
shorter
pass
than
the
col
du
g√©ant
and
i
believe
we
discovered
a
quicker
way
of
getting
from
chamounix
to
courmayeur
or
than
will
be
found
elsewhere
so
long
as
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
remains
in
its
present
condition
chapter

the
first
ascent
of
the

in
almost
every

experience
is
worth
more
than

all
of
the
excursions
that
were
set
down
in
my

had
been
carried
out
with
the
exception
of
the
ascent
of

and
we
now
turned
our
faces
in

direction
but
instead
of
returning
the
val

we
took
a
route
across
country
and
bagged
upon
our
way
the
summit
of
the
ruinette
we
passed
the
night
of
july
at
aosta
under
the
roof
of

genial
tairraz
and
on
the
went
by
the
val
d
ollomont
and
the
col
de
la

to
chermontane
we
slept
that
night
at
the
chalets
of
chanrion
a
foul
spot
which
should
be
avoided
left
them
at
the
next
morning
and
after
a
short
scramble
over
the
slope
above
and
a
tramp
on
the
glacier
de
breney
we
crossed
directly
to
the
ruinette
and
went
almost
straight
up
it
there
is
not
i
suppose
another
mountain
in
the
alps
of
the
same
height
that
can
be
ascended
so
easily
you
have
only
to
go
ahead
upon
its
southern
side
one
can
walk
about
almost
anywhere
though
i
speak
thus
slightingly
of
a
very
respectable
peak
i
will
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
in
regard
to
the
view
which
it
gives
it
is
happily
placed
in
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
pennine
alps
and
as
a
it
has
not
many
superiors
you
see
mountains
and
nothing
but
mountains
it
is
a
would
say
a
but
it
is
very
grand
the
great
combin
with
its
noble
background
of
the
whole
range
of
mont
blanc
never
looks
so
big
as
it
does
from
here
in
the
contrary
direction
the
matterhorn
overpowers
all
besides
the
dent
d
h√©rens
although
closer
looks
a
mere
outlier
of
its
great
neighbour
and
the
snows
of
monte
rosa
behind
seem
intended
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
give
relief
to
the
crags
in
front
to
the
south
there
is
an
endless
array
of
bec
s
and
becca
s
backed
by
the
great
italian
peaks
whilst
to
the
north
mont
pleureur
holds
it
own
against
the
more
distant
wildstrubel
we
gained
the
summit
at
and
stayed
there
an
hour
and
a
half
my
faithful
guides
then
admonished
me
that
prerayen
whither
we
were
bound
was
still
far
away
and
that
we
had
yet
to
cross
two
lofty
ridges
so
we
resumed
our
harness
and
departed
not
however
before
a
huge
cairn
had
been
built
out
of
the
blocks
of
gneiss
with
which
the
summit
is
bestrewn
then
we
trotted
down
the
slopes
of
the
ruinette
over
the
glacier
de
breney
and
across
a
pass
which
if
it
deserves
a
name
may
be
called
the
col
des
portons
after
the
neighbouring
peaks
thence
we
proceeded
across
the
great
otemma
glacier
towards
the
col
d
olen
the
part
of
the
glacier
that
we
traversed
was
overspread
with
snow
which
completely
concealed
its
numerous
pitfalls
we
marched
across
it
in
single
file
and
of
course
roped
together
all
at
once
almer
dropped
into
a
crevasse
up
to
his
shoulders
i
pulled
in
the
rope
immediately
but
the
snow
gave
way
as
it
was
being
done
and
i
had
to
spread
out
my
arms
to
stop
my
descent
biener
held
fast
and
said
afterwards
that
his
feet
went
through
as
well
so
for
a
moment
all
three
were
in
the
jaws
of
the
crevasse
we
now
altered
our
course
so
as
to
take
the
fissures
transversely
and
changed
it
again
after
the
centre
of
the
glacier
was
passed
and
made
directly
for
the
summit
of
the
col
d
olen
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
observe
after
what
i
have
said
before
that
it
is
my
invariable
practice
to
employ
a
rope
when
traversing
a
glacier
many
guides
even
the
best
ones
object
to
be
roped
more
especially
early
in
the
morning
when
the
snow
is
hard
they
object
sometimes
because
they
think
it
is
unnecessary
crevasses
that
are
bridged
by
snow
are
almost
always
more
or
less
perceptible
by
undulations
on
the
surface
the
snow
droops
down
and
hollows
mark
the
courses
of
the
chasms
beneath
an
experienced
guide
usually
notices
these
almost
imperceptible
wrinkles
steps
one
side
or
the
other
as
the
case
may
require
and
rarely
breaks
through
unawares
guides
think
there
is
no
occasion
to
employ
a
rope
because
they
think
that
they
will
not
be
taken
by
surprise
michel
croz
used
to
be
of
this
opinion
he
used
to
say
that
only
imbeciles
and
children
required
to
be
tied
up
in
the
morning
i
told
him
that
in
this
particular
matter
i
was
a
child
to
him
you
see
these
things
my
good
croz
and
avoid
them
i
do
except
you
point
them
out
to
me
and
so
that
which
is
not
a
danger
to
you
a
danger
to
the
sharper
one
s
eyes
get
by
use
the
less
is
a
rope
required
as
a
protective
against
these
hidden
pitfalls
but
according
to
my
experience
the
sight
never
becomes
so
keen
that
they
can
be
avoided
with
unvarying
certainty
and
i
mentioned
what
occurred
upon
the
otemma
glacier
to
show
that
this
is
so
i
well
remember
my
first
passage
of
the
col
easiest
of
the
higher
alpine
glacier
passes
we
had
a
rope
but
my
guide
said
it
was
not
necessary
he
knew
all
the
crevasses
however
we
did
not
go
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
he
dropped
through
the
snow
into
a
crevasse
up
to
his
neck
he
was
a
heavy
man
and
would
scarcely
have
extricated
himself
alone
anyhow
he
was
very
glad
of
my
assistance
when
he
got
on
to
his
legs
again
he
said
well
i
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
crevasse
there
he
no
longer
objected
to
use
the
rope
and
we
proceeded
upon
my
part
with
greater
peace
of
mind
than
before
i
have
crossed
the
pass
fourteen
times
since
then
and
have
invariably
insisted
upon
being
tied
together
guides
object
to
the
use
of
the
rope
upon
glacier
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
by
their
comrades
and
this
perhaps
is
the
more
common
reason
to
illustrate
this
here
is
another
th√©odule
experience
we
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
ice
and
i
required
to
be
tied
my
guide
a
zermatt
man
of
repute
said
that
no
one
used
a
rope
going
across
that
pass
i
declined
to
argue
the
matter
and
we
put
on
the
rope
though
very
much
against
the
wish
of
my
man
who
protested
that
he
should
have
to
submit
to
perpetual
ridicule
if
we
met
any
of
his
acquaintances
we
had
not
gone
very
far
before
we
saw
a
train
coming
in
the
contrary
direction
ah
cried
my
man
there
is
mentioning
a
guide
who
used
to
be
kept
at
the
riffel
hotel
for
the
ascent
of
monte
rosa
it
will
be
as
i
said
i
shall
never
hear
the
end
of
the
guide
we
met
was
followed
by
a
string
of
none
of
whom
were
tied
together
and
had
his
face
covered
by
a
mask
to
prevent
it
becoming
blistered
after
we
had
passed
i
said
now
should
make
any
observations
to
you
ask
him
why
he
takes
such
extraordinary
care
to
preserve
the
skin
of
his
face
which
will
grow
again
in
a
week
when
he
neglects
such
an
obvious
precaution
in
regard
to
his
life
which
he
can
only
lose
this
was
quite
a
new
idea
to
my
guide
and
he
said
nothing
more
against
the
use
of
the
rope
so
long
as
we
were
together
i
believe
that
the
unwillingness
to
use
a
rope
upon
glacier
which
born
mountaineers
not
unfrequently
exhibit
on
the
part
of
expert
men
from
the
consciousness
that
they
themselves
incur
little
risk
secondly
on
the
part
of
inferior
men
from
fear
of
ridicule
and
from
aping
the
ways
of
their
superiors
and
thirdly
from
pure
ignorance
or
laziness
whatever
may
be
the
reason
i
raise
up
my
voice
against
the
neglect
of
a
precaution
so
simple
and
so
effectual
in
my
opinion
the
very
first
thing
a
glacier
traveller
requires
is
plenty
of
good
rope
a
committee
of
the
english
alpine
club
was
appointed
in
to
test
and
to
report
upon
the
most
suitable
ropes
for
mountaineering
purposes
and
those
which
were
approved
are
probably
as
good
as
can
be
found
one
is
made
of
manilla
and
another
of
italian
hemp
the
former
is
the
heavier
and
weighs
a
little
more
than
an
ounce
per
foot
ozs
to
feet
the
latter
weighs
ozs
per
feet
but
i
prefer
the
manilla
rope
because
it
is
more
handy
to
handle
both
of
these
ropes
will
sustain
lbs
falling
feet
or
lbs
falling
feet
and
they
break
with
a
dead
weight
of
two
tons
in
we
carried
two
feet
lengths
of
the
manilla
rope
and
the
inconvenience
arising
from
its
weight
was
more
than
made
up
for
by
the
security
which
it
afforded
upon
several
occasions
it
was
worth
more
than
an
extra
guide
now
touching
the
of
the
rope
there
is
a
right
way
and
there
are
wrong
ways
of
using
it
i
often
meet
upon
elegantly
persons
who
are
clearly
out
of
their
element
with
a
guide
stalking
along
in
front
who
pays
no
attention
to
the
innocents
in
his
charge
they
are
tied
together
as
a
matter
of
form
but
they
evidently
have
no
idea
they
are
tied
up
for
they
walk
side
by
side
or
close
together
with
the
rope
trailing
on
the
snow
if
one
tumbles
into
a
crevasse
the
rest
stare
and
say
la
what
is
the
matter
with
smith
unless
as
is
more
likely
they
all
tumble
in
together
this
is
the
wrong
way
to
use
a
rope
it
is
abuse
of
the
rope
illustration
the
wrong
way
to
use
a
rope
on
glacier
it
is
of
the
first
importance
to
keep
the
rope
taut
from
man
to
man
if
this
is
not
done
there
is
no
real
security
and
your
risks
may
be
considerably
magnified
there
is
little
or
no
difficulty
in
extricating
one
man
who
breaks
through
a
bridged
crevasse
if
the
rope
is
taut
but
the
case
may
be
very
awkward
if
two
break
through
at
the
same
moment
close
together
and
there
are
only
two
others
to
aid
or
perhaps
only
one
other
further
the
rope
ought
not
upon
any
account
to
graze
over
snow
ice
or
rocks
otherwise
the
strands
suffer
and
the
lives
of
the
whole
party
may
be
endangered
apart
from
this
it
is
extremely
annoying
to
have
a
rope
knocking
about
one
s
heels
if
circumstances
render
it
impossible
for
the
rope
to
be
kept
taut
by
itself
the
men
behind
should
gather
it
up
round
their
hands
and
not
allow
it
to
incommode
those
in
advance
a
man
must
either
be
incompetent
careless
or
selfish
if
he
permits
the
rope
to
dangle
about
the
heels
of
the
person
in
front
of
him
illustration
the
right
way
to
use
the
rope
the
distance
from
man
to
man
must
neither
be
too
great
nor
too
small
about
feet
between
each
is
sufficient
if
there
are
only
two
or
three
persons
it
is
prudent
to
allow
a
little
feet
more
than
this
is
unnecessary
and
less
than
or
feet
is
not
much
good
it
is
essential
to
examine
your
rope
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
it
is
in
good
condition
if
you
are
wise
you
will
do
this
yourself
every
day
latterly
i
have
examined
every
inch
of
my
rope
overnight
and
upon
more
than
one
occasion
have
found
the
strands
of
the
manilla
rope
nearly
half
severed
through
accidental
grazes
thus
far
the
rope
has
been
supposed
to
be
employed
upon
level
glacier
to
prevent
any
risk
from
concealed
crevasses
on
rocks
and
on
slopes
it
is
used
for
a
different
purpose
namely
to
guard
against
slips
and
in
these
cases
it
is
equally
important
to
keep
it
taut
and
to
preserve
a
reasonable
distance
one
from
the
other
it
is
much
more
troublesome
to
keep
the
rope
taut
upon
slopes
than
upon
the
level
and
upon
difficult
rocks
it
is
all
but
impossible
except
by
adopting
the
plan
of
moving
only
one
at
a
time
see
there
is
no
good
reason
for
employing
a
rope
upon
easy
rocks
and
i
believe
that
its
needless
use
is
likely
to
promote
carelessness
on
difficult
rocks
and
on
frequently
improperly
called
it
is
a
great
advantage
to
be
tied
together
provided
the
rope
is
handled
properly
but
upon
actual
such
as
that
on
the
col
dolent
or
upon
slopes
in
which
ice
is
mingled
with
small
and
loose
rocks
such
as
the
upper
part
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
it
is
almost
useless
because
a
slip
made
by
one
person
might
upset
the
entire
party
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
however
that
men
should
not
be
tied
together
upon
similar
slopes
being
attached
to
others
usually
gives
confidence
and
confidence
decidedly
assists
stability
it
is
more
questionable
whether
men
should
be
in
such
places
at
all
if
a
man
can
keep
on
his
feet
upon
an
cut
in
an
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
be
debarred
from
making
use
of
that
particular
form
of
staircase
if
he
can
not
let
him
keep
clear
of
such
places
there
would
be
no
advantage
in
discoursing
upon
the
use
of
the
rope
at
greater
length
a
single
day
upon
a
mountain
s
side
will
give
a
clearer
idea
of
the
value
of
a
good
rope
and
of
the
numerous
purposes
for
which
it
may
be
employed
than
any
one
will
obtain
from
reading
all
that
has
been
written
upon
the
subject
but
no
one
will
become
really
expert
in
its
management
without
much
experience
from
the
col
d
olen
we
proceeded
down
the
combe
of
the
same
name
to
the
chalets
of
prerayen
and
passed
the
night
of
the
under
the
roof
of
our
old
acquaintance
the
wealthy
herdsman
on
the
we
crossed
the
va
corn√®re
pass
for
breil
my
thoughts
were
fixed
on
the
matterhorn
and
my
guides
knew
that
i
wished
them
to
accompany
me
they
had
an
aversion
to
the
mountain
and
repeatedly
expressed
their
belief
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
ascend
it
but
matterhorn
dear
sir
said
almer
but
he
did
not
speak
of
difficulty
or
of
danger
nor
was
he
shirking
he
offered
to
go
but
he
entreated
that
the
matterhorn
should
be
abandoned
both
men
spoke
fairly
enough
they
did
not
think
that
an
ascent
could
be
made
and
for
their
own
credit
as
well
as
for
my
sake
they
did
not
wish
to
undertake
a
business
which
in
their
opinion
would
only
lead
to
loss
of
time
and
money
i
sent
them
by
the
short
cut
to
breil
and
walked
down
to
val
tournanche
to
look
for
carrel
he
was
not
there
the
villagers
said
that
he
and
three
others
had
started
on
the
to
try
the
matterhorn
by
the
old
way
on
their
own
account
they
will
have
no
luck
i
thought
for
the
clouds
were
low
down
on
the
mountains
and
i
walked
up
to
breil
fully
expecting
to
meet
them
nor
was
i
disappointed
about
up
i
saw
a
group
of
men
clustered
around
a
chalet
upon
the
other
side
of
the
torrent
and
crossing
over
found
that
the
party
had
returned
and
c√¶sar
were
there
gorret
and
maquignaz
they
had
had
no
success
the
weather
they
said
had
been
horrible
and
they
had
scarcely
reached
the
glacier
du
lion
i
explained
the
situation
to
carrel
and
proposed
that
we
with
c√¶sar
and
another
man
should
cross
the
th√©odule
by
moonlight
on
the
and
that
upon
the
we
should
pitch
the
tent
as
high
as
possible
upon
the
east
face
he
was
unwilling
to
abandon
the
old
route
and
urged
me
to
try
it
again
i
promised
to
do
so
provided
the
new
route
failed
this
satisfied
him
and
he
agreed
to
my
proposal
i
then
went
up
to
breil
and
discharged
almer
and
much
regret
for
no
two
men
ever
served
me
more
faithfully
or
more
willingly
on
the
next
day
they
crossed
to
zermatt
the
was
occupied
with
preparations
the
weather
was
stormy
and
black
rainy
vapours
obscured
the
mountains
towards
evening
a
young
man
came
from
val
tournanche
and
reported
that
an
englishman
was
lying
there
extremely
now
was
the
time
for
the
performance
of
my
vow
and
on
the
morning
of
sunday
the
i
went
down
the
valley
to
look
after
the
sick
man
on
my
way
i
passed
a
foreign
gentleman
with
a
mule
and
several
porters
laden
with
baggage
amongst
these
men
were
and
c√¶sar
carrying
some
barometers
hullo
i
said
what
are
you
doing
they
explained
that
the
foreigner
had
arrived
just
as
they
were
setting
out
and
that
they
were
assisting
his
porters
very
well
go
on
to
breil
and
await
me
there
we
start
at
midnight
as
then
said
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
serve
me
after
tuesday
the
as
he
was
engaged
to
travel
with
a
family
of
distinction
in
the
valley
of
aosta
and
c√¶sar
and
c√¶sar
why
did
you
not
say
this
before
because
said
he
it
was
not
settled
the
engagement
is
of
long
standing
but
was
not
fixed
when
i
got
back
to
val
tournanche
on
friday
night
after
leaving
you
i
found
a
letter
naming
the
i
could
not
object
to
the
answer
but
the
prospect
of
being
left
guideless
was
provoking
they
went
up
and
i
down
the
valley
the
sick
man
declared
that
he
was
better
though
the
exertion
of
saying
as
much
tumbled
him
over
on
to
the
floor
in
a
fainting
fit
he
was
badly
in
want
of
medicine
and
i
tramped
down
to
chatillon
to
get
it
it
was
late
before
i
returned
to
val
tournanche
for
the
weather
was
tempestuous
and
rain
fell
in
torrents
a
figure
passed
me
under
the
church
porch
vive
i
thought
you
were
at
no
sir
when
the
storms
came
on
i
knew
we
should
not
start
and
so
came
down
to
sleep
ha
carrel
i
said
this
is
a
great
bore
if
is
not
fine
we
shall
not
be
able
to
do
anything
together
i
have
sent
away
my
guides
relying
on
you
and
now
you
are
going
to
leave
me
to
travel
with
a
party
of
ladies
that
work
is
not
fit
for
he
smiled
i
supposed
at
the
implied
compliment
can
t
you
send
some
one
else
instead
no
monsieur
i
am
sorry
but
my
word
is
pledged
i
should
like
to
accompany
you
but
i
can
t
break
my
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
inn
door
well
it
is
no
fault
of
yours
come
presently
with
c√¶sar
and
have
some
they
came
and
we
sat
up
till
midnight
recounting
our
old
adventures
in
the
inn
of
val
tournanche
the
weather
continued
bad
upon
the
and
i
returned
to
breil
the
two
carrels
were
again
hovering
about
the
above
mentioned
chalet
and
i
bade
them
adieu
in
the
evening
the
sick
man
crawled
up
a
good
deal
better
but
his
was
the
only
arrival
the
monday
crowd
did
not
cross
the
th√©odule
on
account
of
the
continued
storms
the
inn
was
lonely
i
went
to
bed
early
and
was
awoke
the
next
morning
by
the
invalid
inquiring
if
i
had
heard
the
no
what
news
why
said
he
a
large
party
of
guides
went
off
this
morning
to
try
the
matterhorn
taking
with
them
a
mule
laden
with
i
went
to
the
door
and
with
a
telescope
saw
the
party
upon
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountain
favre
the
landlord
stood
by
what
is
all
this
about
i
inquired
who
is
the
leader
of
this
party
what
yes
is
c√¶sar
there
too
yes
he
is
then
i
saw
in
a
moment
that
i
had
been
bamboozled
and
humbugged
and
learned
bit
by
bit
that
the
affair
had
been
arranged
long
beforehand
the
start
on
the
had
been
for
a
preliminary
reconnaissance
the
mule
that
i
passed
was
conveying
stores
for
the
attack
the
family
of
distinction
was
signor
giordano
who
had
just
despatched
the
party
to
facilitate
the
way
to
the
summit
and
who
when
the
facilitation
was
completed
was
to
be
taken
to
the
top
along
with
signor
sella
i
was
greatly
mortified
my
plans
were
upset
the
italians
had
clearly
stolen
a
march
upon
me
and
i
saw
that
the
astute
favre
chuckled
over
my
discomfiture
because
the
route
by
the
eastern
face
if
successful
would
not
benefit
his
inn
what
was
to
be
done
i
retired
to
my
room
and
soothed
by
tobacco
my
plans
to
see
if
it
was
not
possible
to
outman≈ìuvre
the
italians
they
have
taken
a
mule
s
load
of
that
is
point
in
my
favour
for
they
will
take
two
or
three
days
to
get
through
the
food
and
until
that
is
done
no
work
will
be
how
is
the
weather
i
went
to
the
window
the
mountain
was
smothered
up
in
mist
another
point
in
my
they
are
to
facilitate
the
way
well
if
they
do
that
to
any
purpose
it
will
be
a
long
altogether
i
reckoned
that
they
could
not
possibly
ascend
the
mountain
and
come
back
to
breil
in
less
than
seven
days
i
got
cooler
for
it
was
evident
that
the
wily
ones
might
be
outwitted
after
all
there
was
time
enough
to
go
to
zermatt
to
try
the
eastern
face
and
should
it
prove
impracticable
to
come
back
to
breil
before
the
men
returned
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
as
the
mountain
was
not
padlocked
one
might
start
at
the
same
time
as
the
messieurs
and
yet
get
to
the
top
before
them
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
go
to
zermatt
easier
said
than
done
the
seven
guides
upon
the
mountain
included
the
ablest
men
in
the
valley
and
none
of
the
ordinary
were
at
breil
two
men
at
least
were
wanted
for
my
baggage
but
not
a
soul
could
be
found
i
ran
about
and
sent
about
in
all
directions
but
not
a
single
porter
could
be
obtained
one
was
with
carrel
another
was
ill
another
was
at
chatillon
and
so
forth
even
meynet
the
hunchback
could
not
be
induced
to
come
he
was
in
the
thick
of
some
important
operations
i
was
in
the
position
of
a
general
without
an
army
it
was
all
very
well
to
make
plans
but
there
was
no
one
to
execute
them
this
did
not
much
trouble
me
for
it
was
evident
that
so
long
as
the
weather
stopped
traffic
over
the
th√©odule
pass
it
would
hinder
the
men
equally
upon
the
matterhorn
and
i
knew
that
directly
it
improved
company
would
certainly
arrive
about
midday
on
tuesday
the
a
large
party
hove
in
sight
from
zermatt
preceded
by
a
nimble
young
englishman
and
one
of
old
peter
taugwalder
s
sons
i
went
at
once
to
this
gentleman
to
learn
if
he
could
dispense
with
taugwalder
he
said
that
he
could
not
as
they
were
going
to
recross
to
zermatt
on
the
morrow
but
that
the
young
man
should
assist
in
transporting
my
baggage
as
he
had
nothing
to
carry
we
naturally
got
into
conversation
i
told
my
story
and
learned
that
the
young
englishman
was
lord
francis
douglas
whose
recent
ascent
of
the
excited
my
wonder
and
admiration
he
brought
good
news
old
peter
had
lately
been
beyond
the
h√∂rnli
and
had
reported
that
he
thought
an
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
was
possible
upon
that
side
almer
had
left
zermatt
and
could
not
be
recovered
so
i
determined
to
seek
for
old
peter
lord
francis
douglas
expressed
a
warm
desire
to
ascend
the
mountain
and
before
long
it
was
determined
that
he
should
take
part
in
the
expedition
favre
could
no
longer
hinder
our
departure
and
lent
us
one
of
his
men
we
crossed
the
col
th√©odule
on
wednesday
morning
the
of
july
rounded
the
foot
of
the
ober
th√©odulgletscher
crossed
the
furggengletscher
and
deposited
tent
blankets
ropes
and
other
matters
in
the
little
chapel
at
the
schwarzsee
all
four
were
heavily
laden
for
we
brought
across
the
whole
of
my
stores
from
breil
of
rope
alone
there
was
about
feet
there
were
three
kinds
first
feet
of
the
manilla
rope
second
feet
of
a
stouter
and
probably
stronger
rope
than
the
first
and
third
more
than
feet
of
a
lighter
and
weaker
rope
than
the
first
of
a
kind
that
i
used
formerly
stout
we
descended
to
zermatt
sought
and
engaged
old
peter
and
gave
him
permission
to
choose
another
guide
when
we
returned
to
the
monte
rosa
hotel
whom
should
we
see
sitting
upon
the
wall
in
front
but
my
old
michel
croz
i
supposed
that
he
had
come
with
but
i
learned
that
that
gentleman
had
arrived
in
ill
health
at
chamounix
and
had
returned
to
england
croz
thus
left
free
had
been
immediately
engaged
by
the
rev
charles
hudson
and
they
had
come
to
zermatt
with
the
same
object
as
to
attempt
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
lord
francis
douglas
and
i
dined
at
the
monte
rosa
and
had
just
finished
when
hudson
and
a
friend
entered
the
√†
they
had
returned
from
inspecting
the
mountain
and
some
idlers
in
the
room
demanded
their
intentions
we
heard
a
confirmation
of
croz
s
statement
and
learned
that
hudson
intended
to
set
out
on
the
morrow
at
the
same
hour
as
ourselves
we
left
the
room
to
consult
and
agreed
it
was
undesirable
that
two
independent
parties
should
be
on
the
mountain
at
the
same
time
with
the
same
object
hudson
was
therefore
invited
to
join
us
and
he
accepted
our
proposal
before
admitting
his
took
the
precaution
to
inquire
what
he
had
done
in
the
alps
and
as
well
as
i
remember
hudson
s
reply
was
mr
hadow
has
done
mont
blanc
in
less
time
than
most
he
then
mentioned
several
other
excursions
that
were
unknown
to
me
and
added
in
answer
to
a
further
question
i
consider
he
is
a
sufficiently
good
man
to
go
with
hadow
was
admitted
without
any
further
question
and
we
then
went
into
the
matter
of
guides
hudson
thought
that
croz
and
old
peter
would
be
sufficient
the
question
was
referred
to
the
men
themselves
and
they
made
no
objection
so
croz
and
i
became
comrades
once
more
and
as
i
threw
myself
on
my
bed
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
i
wondered
at
the
strange
series
of
chances
which
had
first
separated
us
and
then
brought
us
together
again
i
thought
of
the
mistake
through
which
he
had
accepted
the
engagement
to
of
his
unwillingness
to
adopt
my
route
of
his
recommendation
to
transfer
our
energies
to
the
chain
of
mont
blanc
of
the
retirement
of
almer
and
biener
of
the
desertion
of
carrel
of
the
arrival
of
lord
francis
douglas
and
lastly
of
our
meeting
at
zermatt
and
as
i
pondered
over
these
things
i
could
not
help
asking
what
next
if
any
one
of
the
links
of
this
fatal
chain
of
circumstances
had
been
omitted
what
a
different
story
i
should
have
to
tell
chapter
xix
the
first
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
had
we
succeeded
well
we
had
been
reckoned
mongst
the
wise
our
minds
are
so
disposed
to
judge
from
the
euripides
it
is
a
thoroughly
unfair
but
an
ordinary
custom
to
praise
or
blame
designs
which
in
themselves
may
be
good
or
bad
just
as
they
turn
out
well
or
ill
hence
the
same
actions
are
at
one
time
attributed
to
earnestness
and
at
another
to
pliny
min
we
started
from
zermatt
on
the
of
july
at
on
a
brilliant
and
perfectly
cloudless
morning
we
were
eight
in
old
peter
and
his
two
sons
lord
douglas
hadow
hudson
and
i
to
ensure
steady
motion
one
tourist
and
one
native
walked
together
the
youngest
taugwalder
fell
to
my
share
and
the
lad
marched
well
proud
to
be
on
the
expedition
and
happy
to
show
his
powers
the
also
fell
to
my
lot
to
carry
and
throughout
the
day
after
each
drink
i
replenished
them
secretly
with
water
so
that
at
the
next
halt
they
were
found
fuller
than
before
this
was
considered
a
good
omen
and
little
short
of
miraculous
on
the
first
day
we
did
not
intend
to
ascend
to
any
great
height
and
we
mounted
accordingly
very
leisurely
picked
up
the
things
which
were
left
in
the
chapel
at
the
schwarzsee
at
and
proceeded
thence
along
the
ridge
connecting
the
h√∂rnli
with
the
matterhorn
at
we
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
actual
peak
then
quitted
the
ridge
and
clambered
round
some
ledges
on
to
the
eastern
face
we
were
now
fairly
upon
the
mountain
and
were
astonished
to
find
that
places
which
from
the
riffel
or
even
from
the
furggengletscher
looked
entirely
impracticable
were
so
easy
that
we
could
before
twelve
o
clock
we
had
found
a
good
position
for
the
tent
at
a
height
of
feet
croz
and
young
peter
went
on
to
see
what
was
above
in
order
to
save
time
on
the
following
morning
they
cut
across
the
heads
of
the
which
descended
towards
the
furggengletscher
and
disappeared
round
a
corner
and
shortly
afterwards
we
saw
them
high
up
on
the
face
moving
quickly
we
others
made
a
solid
platform
for
the
tent
in
a
spot
and
then
watched
eagerly
for
the
return
of
the
men
the
stones
which
they
upset
told
that
they
were
very
high
and
we
supposed
that
the
way
must
be
easy
at
length
just
before
we
saw
them
coming
down
evidently
much
excited
what
are
they
saying
peter
gentlemen
they
say
it
is
no
but
when
they
came
near
we
heard
a
different
story
nothing
but
what
was
good
not
a
difficulty
not
a
single
difficulty
we
could
have
gone
to
the
summit
and
returned
easily
we
passed
the
remaining
hours
of
basking
in
the
sunshine
some
sketching
or
collecting
and
when
the
sun
went
down
giving
as
it
departed
a
glorious
promise
for
the
morrow
we
returned
to
the
tent
to
arrange
for
the
night
hudson
made
tea
i
coffee
and
we
then
retired
each
one
to
his
the
taugwalders
lord
francis
douglas
and
myself
occupying
the
tent
the
others
remaining
by
preference
outside
long
after
dusk
the
cliffs
above
echoed
with
our
laughter
and
with
the
songs
of
the
guides
for
we
were
happy
that
night
in
camp
and
feared
no
evil
we
assembled
together
outside
the
tent
before
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
and
started
directly
it
was
light
enough
to
move
young
peter
came
on
with
us
as
a
guide
and
his
brother
returned
to
zermatt
we
followed
the
route
which
had
been
taken
on
the
previous
day
and
in
a
few
minutes
turned
the
rib
which
had
intercepted
the
view
of
the
eastern
face
from
our
tent
platform
the
whole
of
this
great
slope
was
now
revealed
rising
for
feet
like
a
huge
natural
staircase
some
parts
were
more
and
others
were
less
easy
but
we
were
not
once
brought
to
a
halt
by
any
serious
impediment
for
when
an
obstruction
was
met
in
front
it
could
always
be
turned
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
there
was
indeed
no
occasion
for
the
rope
and
sometimes
hudson
led
sometimes
myself
at
we
had
attained
a
height
of
feet
and
halted
for
we
then
continued
the
ascent
without
a
break
until
when
we
stopped
for
minutes
at
a
height
of
feet
twice
we
struck
the
ridge
and
followed
it
for
some
little
distance
no
advantage
for
it
was
usually
more
rotten
and
steep
and
always
more
difficult
than
the
face
still
we
kept
near
to
it
lest
stones
perchance
might
fall
we
had
now
arrived
at
the
foot
of
that
part
which
from
the
riffelberg
or
from
zermatt
seems
perpendicular
or
overhanging
and
could
no
longer
continue
upon
the
eastern
side
for
a
little
distance
we
ascended
by
snow
upon
the
ar√™te
is
the
towards
zermatt
and
then
by
common
consent
turned
over
to
the
right
or
to
the
northern
side
before
doing
so
we
made
a
change
in
the
order
of
ascent
croz
went
first
i
followed
hudson
came
third
hadow
and
old
peter
were
last
now
said
croz
as
he
led
off
now
for
something
altogether
the
work
became
difficult
and
required
caution
in
some
places
there
was
little
to
hold
and
it
was
desirable
that
those
should
be
in
front
who
were
least
likely
to
slip
the
general
slope
of
the
mountain
at
this
part
was
than
and
snow
had
accumulated
in
and
had
filled
up
the
interstices
of
the
leaving
only
occasional
fragments
projecting
here
and
there
these
were
at
times
covered
with
a
thin
film
of
ice
produced
from
the
melting
and
refreezing
of
the
snow
it
was
the
counterpart
on
a
small
scale
of
the
upper
feet
of
the
pointe
des
ecrins
there
was
this
material
difference
the
face
of
the
ecrins
was
about
or
exceeded
an
angle
of
and
the
matterhorn
face
was
less
than
it
was
a
place
over
which
any
fair
mountaineer
might
pass
in
safety
and
hudson
ascended
this
part
and
as
far
as
i
know
the
entire
mountain
without
having
the
slightest
assistance
rendered
to
him
upon
any
occasion
sometimes
after
i
had
taken
a
hand
from
croz
or
received
a
pull
i
turned
to
offer
the
same
to
hudson
but
he
invariably
declined
saying
it
was
not
necessary
hadow
however
was
not
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
work
and
required
continual
assistance
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
the
difficulty
which
he
found
at
this
part
arose
simply
and
entirely
from
want
of
experience
this
solitary
difficult
part
was
of
no
great
extent
we
bore
away
over
it
at
first
nearly
horizontally
for
a
distance
of
about
feet
then
ascended
directly
towards
the
summit
for
about
feet
and
then
doubled
back
to
the
ridge
which
descends
towards
zermatt
a
long
stride
round
a
rather
awkward
corner
brought
us
to
snow
once
more
the
last
doubt
vanished
the
matterhorn
was
ours
nothing
but
feet
of
easy
snow
remained
to
be
surmounted
you
must
now
carry
your
thoughts
back
to
the
seven
italians
who
started
from
breil
on
the
of
july
four
days
had
passed
since
their
departure
and
we
were
tormented
with
anxiety
lest
they
should
arrive
on
the
top
before
us
all
the
way
up
we
had
talked
of
them
and
many
false
alarms
of
men
on
the
summit
had
been
raised
the
higher
we
rose
the
more
intense
became
the
excitement
what
if
we
should
be
beaten
at
the
last
moment
the
slope
eased
off
at
length
we
could
be
detached
and
croz
and
i
dashing
away
ran
a
race
which
ended
in
a
dead
heat
at
the
world
was
at
our
feet
and
the
matterhorn
was
conquered
hurrah
not
a
footstep
could
be
seen
it
was
not
yet
certain
that
we
had
not
been
beaten
the
summit
of
the
matterhorn
was
formed
of
a
rudely
level
ridge
about
feet
long
and
the
italians
might
have
been
at
its
farther
extremity
i
hastened
to
the
southern
end
scanning
the
snow
right
and
left
eagerly
hurrah
again
it
was
untrodden
where
were
the
men
i
peered
over
the
cliff
half
doubting
half
expectant
i
saw
them
dots
on
the
ridge
at
an
immense
distance
below
up
went
my
arms
and
my
hat
croz
croz
come
here
where
are
they
monsieur
there
don
t
you
see
them
down
there
ah
the
they
are
low
croz
we
must
make
those
fellows
hear
we
yelled
until
we
were
hoarse
the
italians
seemed
to
regard
could
not
be
certain
croz
we
make
them
hear
us
they
hear
us
i
seized
a
block
of
rock
and
hurled
it
down
and
called
upon
my
companion
in
the
name
of
friendship
to
do
the
same
we
drove
our
sticks
in
and
prized
away
the
crags
and
soon
a
torrent
of
stones
poured
down
the
cliffs
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
this
time
the
italians
turned
and
fled
illustration
croz
croz
come
here
still
i
would
that
the
leader
of
that
party
could
have
stood
with
us
at
that
moment
for
our
victorious
shouts
conveyed
to
him
the
disappointment
of
the
ambition
of
a
lifetime
he
was
man
of
all
those
who
attempted
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
who
most
deserved
to
be
the
first
upon
its
summit
he
was
the
first
to
doubt
its
inaccessibility
and
he
was
the
only
man
who
persisted
in
believing
that
its
ascent
would
be
accomplished
it
was
the
aim
of
his
life
to
make
the
ascent
from
the
side
of
italy
for
the
honour
of
his
native
valley
for
a
time
he
had
the
game
in
his
hands
he
played
it
as
he
thought
best
but
he
made
a
false
move
and
he
lost
it
times
have
changed
with
carrel
his
supremacy
is
questioned
in
the
val
tournanche
new
men
have
arisen
and
he
is
no
longer
recognised
as
chasseur
above
all
others
though
so
long
as
he
remains
the
man
that
he
is
it
will
not
be
easy
to
find
his
superior
the
others
had
arrived
so
we
went
back
to
the
northern
end
of
the
ridge
croz
now
took
the
and
planted
it
in
the
highest
snow
yes
we
said
there
is
the
but
where
is
the
flag
here
it
is
he
answered
pulling
off
his
blouse
and
fixing
it
to
the
stick
it
made
a
poor
flag
and
there
was
no
wind
to
float
it
out
yet
it
was
seen
all
around
they
saw
it
at
the
the
val
tournanche
at
breil
the
watchers
cried
victory
is
ours
they
raised
bravos
for
carrel
and
vivas
for
italy
and
hastened
to
put
themselves
on
the
morrow
they
were
undeceived
all
was
changed
the
explorers
returned
it
is
true
said
the
men
we
saw
them
hurled
stones
at
us

old

we
returned
to
the
southern
end
of
the
ridge
to
build
a
cairn
and
then
paid
homage
to
the
view
the
day
was
one
of
those
superlatively
calm
and
clear
ones
which
usually
precede
bad
weather
the
atmosphere
was
perfectly
still
and
free
from
all
clouds
or
vapours

and
out
with
faultless
definition
pleasant
thoughts
of
happy
days
in
bygone
years
came
up
unbidden
as
we
recognised
the
old
familiar
forms
all
were
one
of
the
principal
peaks
of
the
alps
was
hidden
i
see
them
clearly
great
inner
circles
of
giants
backed
by
the
ranges

and
first
came
the
dent
blanche
hoary
and
grand
the
gabelhorn
and
pointed
rothhorn
and
then
the
peerless
weisshorn
the
towering
mischabelh√∂rner
flanked
by
the
allaleinhorn
strahlhorn
and

then
monte
its
many
lyskamm
and
the
breithorn
behind
was
the
bernese

governed
by
the
finsteraarhorn
and
then
the
simplon
and
gothard
groups
the
disgrazia
and
the
orteler
towards
the
south
we
looked
down
to
chivasso
on
the
plain
of
piedmont
and
far
beyond
the
hundred
miles
close
upon
us
the
maritime
hundred
and
thirty
miles
free
from
haze
then
came
my
first
pelvoux
the
ecrins
and
the
meije
the
clusters
of
the
graians
and
lastly
in
the
west
gorgeous
in
the
full
sunlight
rose
the
monarch
of
blanc
ten
thousand
feet
beneath
us
were
the
green
fields
of
zermatt
dotted
with
chalets
from
which
blue
smoke
rose
lazily
eight
thousand
feet
below
on
the
other
side
were
the
pastures
of
breil
there
were
black
and
gloomy
forests
bright
and
cheerful
meadows
bounding
waterfalls
and
tranquil
lakes
fertile
lands
and
savage
wastes
sunny
plains
and
frigid
there
were
the
most
rugged
forms
and
the
most
graceful
perpendicular
cliffs
and
gentle
undulating
slopes
rocky
mountains
and
snowy
mountains
sombre
and
solemn
or
glittering
and
white
with
spires
there
was
every
combination
that
the
world
can
give
and
every
contrast
that
the
heart
could
desire
we
remained
on
the
summit
for
one
one
crowded
hour
of
glorious
it
passed
away
too
quickly
and
we
began
to
prepare
for
the
descent
illustration
the
actual
summit
of
the
matterhorn
in
chapter
xx
descent
of
the
matterhorn
hudson
and
i
again
consulted
as
to
the
best
and
safest
arrangement
of
the
party
we
agreed
that
it
would
be
best
for
croz
to
go
first
and
hadow
second
hudson
who
was
almost
equal
to
a
guide
in
sureness
of
foot
wished
to
be
third
lord
douglas
was
placed
next
and
old
peter
the
strongest
of
the
remainder
after
him
i
suggested
to
hudson
that
we
should
attach
a
rope
to
the
rocks
on
our
arrival
at
the
difficult
bit
and
hold
it
as
we
descended
as
an
additional
protection
he
approved
the
idea
but
it
was
not
definitely
settled
that
it
should
be
done
the
party
was
being
arranged
in
the
above
order
whilst
i
was
sketching
the
summit
and
they
had
finished
and
were
waiting
for
me
to
be
tied
in
line
when
some
one
remembered
that
our
names
had
not
been
left
in
a
bottle
they
requested
me
to
write
them
down
and
moved
off
while
it
was
being
done
a
few
minutes
afterwards
i
tied
myself
to
young
peter
ran
down
after
the
others
and
caught
them
just
as
they
were
commencing
the
descent
of
the
difficult
part
great
care
was
being
taken
only
one
man
was
moving
at
a
time
when
he
was
firmly
planted
the
next
advanced
and
so
on
they
had
not
however
attached
the
additional
rope
to
rocks
and
nothing
was
said
about
it
the
suggestion
was
not
made
for
my
own
sake
and
i
am
not
sure
that
it
even
occurred
to
me
again
for
some
little
distance
we
two
followed
the
others
detached
from
them
and
should
have
continued
so
had
not
lord
douglas
asked
me
about
to
tie
on
to
old
peter
as
he
feared
he
said
that
taugwalder
would
not
be
able
to
hold
his
ground
if
a
slip
occurred
a
few
minutes
later
a
lad
ran
into
the
monte
rosa
hotel
to
seiler
saying
that
he
had
seen
an
avalanche
fall
from
the
summit
of
the
matterhorn
on
to
the
matterhorngletscher
the
boy
was
reproved
for
telling
idle
stories
he
was
right
nevertheless
and
this
was
what
he
saw
michel
croz
had
laid
aside
his
axe
and
in
order
to
give
hadow
greater
security
was
absolutely
taking
hold
of
his
legs
and
putting
his
feet
one
by
one
into
their
proper
positions
as
far
as
i
know
no
one
was
actually
descending
i
can
not
speak
with
certainty
because
the
two
leading
men
were
partially
hidden
from
my
sight
by
an
intervening
mass
of
rock
but
it
is
my
belief
from
the
movements
of
their
shoulders
that
croz
having
done
as
i
have
said
was
in
the
act
of
turning
round
to
go
down
a
step
or
two
himself
at
this
moment
hadow
slipped
fell
against
him
and
knocked
him
over
i
heard
one
startled
exclamation
from
croz
then
saw
him
and
hadow
flying
downwards
in
another
moment
hudson
was
dragged
from
his
steps
and
lord
douglas
immediately
after
him
all
this
was
the
work
of
a
moment
immediately
we
heard
croz
s
exclamation
old
peter
and
i
planted
ourselves
as
firmly
as
the
rocks
would
permit
the
rope
was
taut
between
us
and
the
jerk
came
on
us
both
as
on
one
man
we
held
but
the
rope
broke
midway
between
taugwalder
and
lord
francis
douglas
for
a
few
seconds
we
saw
our
unfortunate
companions
sliding
downwards
on
their
backs
and
spreading
out
their
hands
endeavouring
to
save
themselves
they
passed
from
our
sight
uninjured
disappeared
one
by
one
and
fell
from
precipice
to
precipice
on
to
the
matterhorngletscher
below
a
distance
of
nearly
feet
in
height
from
the
moment
the
rope
broke
it
was
impossible
to
help
them
illustration
rope
broken
on
the
matterhorn
so
perished
our
comrades
for
the
space
of
we
remained
on
the
spot
without
moving
a
single
step
the
two
men
paralysed
by
terror
cried
like
infants
and
trembled
in
such
a
manner
as
to
threaten
us
with
the
fate
of
the
others
old
peter
rent
the
air
with
exclamations
of
chamounix
oh
what
will
chamounix
say
he
meant
who
would
believe
that
croz
could
fall
the
young
man
did
nothing
but
scream
or
sob
we
are
lost
we
are
lost
fixed
between
the
two
i
could
neither
move
up
nor
down
i
begged
young
peter
to
descend
but
he
dared
not
unless
he
did
we
could
not
advance
old
peter
became
alive
to
the
danger
and
swelled
the
cry
we
are
lost
we
are
lost
the
father
s
fear
was
trembled
for
his
son
the
young
man
s
fear
was
thought
of
self
alone
at
last
old
peter
summoned
up
courage
and
changed
his
position
to
a
rock
to
which
he
could
fix
the
rope
the
young
man
then
descended
and
we
all
stood
together
immediately
we
did
so
i
asked
for
the
rope
which
had
given
way
and
found
to
my
to
my
it
was
the
weakest
of
the
three
ropes
it
was
not
brought
and
should
not
have
been
employed
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
used
it
was
old
rope
and
compared
with
the
others
was
feeble
it
was
intended
as
a
reserve
in
case
we
had
to
leave
much
rope
behind
attached
to
rocks
i
saw
at
once
that
a
serious
question
was
involved
and
made
him
give
me
the
end
it
had
broken
in
and
it
did
not
appear
to
have
sustained
previous
injury
for
more
than
two
hours
afterwards
i
thought
almost
every
moment
that
the
next
would
be
my
last
for
the
taugwalders
utterly
unnerved
were
not
only
incapable
of
giving
assistance
but
were
in
such
a
state
that
a
slip
might
have
been
expected
from
them
at
any
moment
after
a
time
we
were
able
to
do
that
which
should
have
been
done
at
first
and
fixed
rope
to
firm
rocks
in
addition
to
being
tied
together
these
ropes
were
cut
from
time
to
time
and
were
left
behind
even
with
their
assurance
the
men
were
sometimes
afraid
to
proceed
and
several
times
old
peter
turned
with
ashy
face
and
faltering
limbs
and
said
with
terrible
emphasis
can
not
illustration
seen
from
the
matterhorn
on
july
the
taugwalders
thought
that
it
had
some
connection
with
the
accident
about
we
arrived
at
the
snow
upon
the
ridge
descending
towards
zermatt
and
all
peril
was
over
we
frequently
looked
but
in
vain
for
traces
of
our
unfortunate
companions
we
bent
over
the
ridge
and
cried
to
them
but
no
sound
returned
convinced
at
last
that
they
were
neither
within
sight
nor
hearing
we
ceased
from
our
useless
efforts
and
too
cast
down
for
speech
silently
gathered
up
our
things
and
the
little
effects
of
those
who
were
lost
preparatory
to
continuing
the
descent
when
lo
a
mighty
arch
appeared
rising
above
the
lyskamm
high
into
the
sky
pale
colourless
and
noiseless
but
perfectly
sharp
and
defined
except
where
it
was
lost
in
the
clouds
this
unearthly
apparition
seemed
like
a
vision
from
another
world
and
almost
appalled
we
watched
with
amazement
the
gradual
development
of
two
vast
crosses
one
on
either
side
if
the
taugwalders
had
not
been
the
first
to
perceive
it
i
should
have
doubted
my
senses
they
thought
it
had
some
connection
with
the
accident
and
i
after
a
while
that
it
might
bear
some
relation
to
ourselves
but
our
movements
had
no
effect
upon
it
the
spectral
forms
remained
motionless
it
was
a
fearful
and
wonderful
sight
unique
in
my
experience
and
impressive
beyond
description
coming
at
such
a
moment
i
was
ready
to
leave
and
waiting
for
the
others
they
had
recovered
their
appetites
and
the
use
of
their
tongues
they
spoke
in
patois
which
i
did
not
understand
at
length
the
son
said
in
french
we
are
poor
men
we
have
lost
our
herr
we
shall
not
get
paid
we
can
ill
afford
stop
i
said
interrupting
him
that
is
nonsense
i
shall
pay
you
of
course
just
as
if
your
herr
were
they
talked
together
in
their
patois
for
a
short
time
and
then
the
son
spoke
again
we
don
t
wish
you
to
pay
us
we
wish
you
to
write
in
the
at
zermatt
and
to
your
journals
that
we
have
not

nonsense
are

monsieur
alex
seiler
who
would
answer
such
a
proposition
i
made
them
no
reply
in
words
but
they
knew
very
well
the
indignation
that
i
felt
they
filled
the
cup
of
bitterness
to
overflowing
and
i
tore
down
the
cliff
madly
and
recklessly
in
a
way
that
caused
them
more
than
once
to
inquire
if
i
wished
to
kill
them

fell
and
for
an
hour
the
descent
was
continued

darkness

was
found
and
upon
a
wretched
slab
barely
large
enough
to
hold

passed

hours

was

met
me
at

door
and
followed
in
silence
to
my
room
what
is
the
matter

taugwalders
and
i
have
he
did
not
need
more
and
burst
into
tears
but
lost
no
time
in
useless
lamentations
and
set
to
work
to
arouse
the
village
ere
long
a
score
of
men
had
started
to
ascend
the

heights
above

commanded

returned
after

hours
and
reported
that
they
had
seen
the
bodies
lying
motionless
on
the
snow

was
on
saturday
and
they
proposed
that
we
should
leave
on

had
fallen
had
been

had
been

used
this
had
a

ugly
look

it
was
not

to
suppose
that
the
others
would
have
sanctioned
the
employment
of
a
rope
so
greatly
inferior
in
strength

there
were
more
than
feet
of
the
better
qualities

remaining
out
of
use

the

of
the
old
guide

bore
a
good
reputation
and
upon
all
other
accounts
it
was
desirable
that
this
matter
should
be
cleared
up
and
after
my
examination
before
the
court
of
inquiry
which
was
instituted
by
the
government
was
over
i
handed
in
a
number
of
questions

were
framed
so
as
to
afford
old
peter
an
opportunity
of
exculpating
himself
from
the
grave
suspicions
which
at
once
fell
upon
him
the
questions
i
was
told
were
put
and
answered

answers

promised

my
mountaineering
in
the
alps
came
to
a
close
the
disastrous
termination
though
casting
a
permanent
cloud
over
otherwise
happy
memories
and
leaving
a
train
of
regrets
has
not
altered
my
regard
for
the
purest
healthiest
and
most
manly
of
sports
and
often
in
grappling
with
every
day
difficulties
sometimes
in
apparently
hopeless
tasks
encouragement
has
been
found
in
the
remembrance
of
victories
over
stubborn
alps
we
who
go
have
constantly
set
before
us
the
superiority
of
fixed
purpose
or
perseverance
to
brute
force
we
know
that
each
height
each
step
must
be
gained
by
patient
laborious
toil
and
that
wishing
can
not
take
the
place
of
working
we
know
the
benefits
of
mutual
aid
that
many
a
difficulty
must
be
encountered
and
many
an
obstacle
must
be
grappled
with
or
turned
but
we
know
that
where
there
s
a
will
there
s
a
way
and
we
come
back
to
our
daily
occupations
better
fitted
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
and
to
overcome
the
impediments
which
obstruct
our
paths
strengthened
and
cheered
by
the
recollection
of
past
labours
and
by
the
memories
of
victories
gained
in
other
fields
i
have
not
made
myself
an
apologist
for
mountaineering
nor
do
i
now
intend
to
usurp
the
functions
of
a
moralist
but
my
task
would
have
been
ill
performed
if
it
had
been
concluded
without
one
reference
to
the
more
serious
lessons
of
the
mountaineer
we
glory
in
the
physical
regeneration
which
is
the
product
of
our
exertions
we
exult
over
the
grandeur
of
the
scenes
that
are
brought
before
our
eyes
the
splendours
of
sunrise
and
sunset
and
the
beauties
of
hill
dale
lake
wood
and
waterfall
but
we
value
more
highly
the
development
of
manliness
and
the
evolution
under
combat
with
difficulties
of
those
noble
qualities
of
human
patience
endurance
and
fortitude
some
hold
these
virtues
in
less
estimation
and
assign
base
and
contemptible
motives
to
those
who
indulge
in
our
innocent
sport
be
thou
chaste
as
ice
as
pure
as
snow
thou
shalt
not
escape
others
again
who
are
not
detractors
find
mountaineering
as
a
sport
to
be
wholly
unintelligible
it
is
not
greatly
to
be
wondered
are
not
all
constituted
alike
mountaineering
is
a
pursuit
essentially
adapted
to
the
young
or
vigorous
and
not
to
the
old
or
feeble
to
the
latter
toil
may
be
no
pleasure
and
it
is
often
said
by
such
persons
this
man
is
making
a
toil
of
let
the
motto
on
the
be
an
answer
if
an
answer
be
required
toil
he
must
who
goes
mountaineering
but
out
of
the
toil
comes
strength
not
merely
muscular
than
that
an
awakening
of
all
the
faculties
and
from
the
strength
arises
pleasure
then
again
it
is
often
asked
in
tones
which
seem
to
imply
that
the
answer
must
at
least
be
doubtful
but
does
it
repay
you
well
we
can
not
estimate
our
enjoyment
as
you
measure
your
wine
or
weigh
your
lead
is
real
nevertheless
if
i
could
blot
out
every
reminiscence
or
erase
every
memory
still
i
should
say
that
my
scrambles
amongst
the
alps
have
repaid
me
for
they
have
given
me
two
of
the
best
things
a
man
can
and
friends
the
recollections
of
past
pleasures
can
not
be
effaced
even
now
as
i
write
they
crowd
up
before
me
first
comes
an
endless
series
of
pictures
magnificent
in
form
effect
and
colour
i
see
the
great
peaks
with
clouded
tops
seeming
to
mount
up
for
ever
and
ever
i
hear
the
music
of
the
distant
herds
the
peasant
s
jodel
and
the
solemn
and
i
scent
the
fragrant
breath
of
the
pines
and
after
these
have
passed
away
another
train
of
thoughts
those
who
have
been
upright
brave
and
true
of
kind
hearts
and
bold
deeds
and
of
courtesies
received
at
stranger
hands
trifles
in
themselves
but
expressive
of
that
good
will
towards
men
which
is
the
essence
of
charity
still
the
last
sad
memory
hovers
round
and
sometimes
drifts
across
like
floating
mist
cutting
off
sunshine
and
chilling
the
remembrance
of
happier
times
there
have
been
joys
too
great
to
be
described
in
words
and
there
have
been
griefs
upon
which
i
have
not
dared
to
dwell
and
with
these
in
mind
i
say
climb
if
you
will
but
remember
that
courage
and
strength
are
nought
without
prudence
and
that
a
momentary
negligence
may
destroy
the
happiness
of
a
lifetime
do
nothing
in
haste
look
well
to
each
step

from

what
may

the
death
of
bennen
on
february
gosset
and
started
from
the
village
of
ardon
about
between
sion
and
martigny
to
make
the
ascent
of
the
feet
with
the
guides
nance
rebot
bevard
and
bennen
they
arrived
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
summit
before
and
determined
to
complete
the
ascent
by
following
the
crest
of
a
ridge
leading
towards
the
east
before
this
could
be
done
it
was
necessary
to
cross
some
steep
snow
and
while
passing
this
an
avalanche
was
unfortunately
started
bennen
and
perished
the
others
happily
escaped
the
following
narrative
from
the
pen
of
gosset
illustrates
in
a
very
impressive
manner
the
danger
of
traversing
snow
at
considerable
inclinations
we
had
to
go
up
a
steep
about
feet
high
as
well
as
i
remember
it
was
about
feet
broad
at
the
top
and
or
at
the
bottom
it
was
a
sort
of
couloir
on
a
large
scale
during
the
ascent
we
sank
about
one
foot
deep
at
every
step
bennen
did
not
seem
to
like
the
look
of
the
snow
very
much
he
asked
the
local
guides
whether
avalanches
ever
came
down
this
couloir
to
which
they
answered
that
our
position
was
perfectly
safe
we
had
mounted
on
the
northern
side
of
the
couloir
and
having
arrived
at
feet
from
the
top
we
began
crossing
it
on
a
horizontal
curve
so
as
to
gain
the
ar√™te
the
inflexion
or
dip
of
the
couloir
was
slight
not
above
feet
the
inclination
near
we
were
walking
in
the
following
order
nance
bennen
myself
and
rebot
having
crossed
over
about
of
the
breadth
of
the
couloir
the
two
leading
men
suddenly
sank
considerably
above
their
waists
bennen
tightened
the
rope
the
snow
was
too
deep
to
think
of
getting
out
of
the
hole
they
had
made
so
they
advanced
one
or
two
steps
dividing
the
snow
with
their
bodies
bennen
turned
round
and
told
us
he
was
afraid
of
starting
an
avalanche
we
asked
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
return
and
cross
the
couloir
higher
up
to
this
the
three
ardon
men
opposed
themselves
they
mistook
the
proposed
precaution
for
fear
and
the
two
leading
men
continued
their
work
after
three
or
four
steps
gained
in
the
aforesaid
manner
the
snow
became
hard
again
bennen
had
not
was
evidently
undecided
what
he
should
do
as
soon
however
as
he
saw
hard
snow
again
he
advanced
and
crossed
parallel
to
but
above
the
furrow
the
ardon
men
had
made
strange
to
say
the
snow
supported
him
while
he
was
passing
i
observed
that
the
leader
bevard
had
ten
or
twelve
feet
of
rope
coiled
round
his
shoulder
i
of
course
at
once
told
him
to
uncoil
it
and
get
on
the
ar√™te
from
which
he
was
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
distant
bennen
then
told
me
to
follow
i
tried
his
steps
but
sank
up
to
my
waist
in
the
very
first
so
i
went
through
the
furrows
holding
my
elbows
close
to
my
body
so
as
not
to
touch
the
sides
this
furrow
was
about
twelve
feet
long
and
as
the
snow
was
good
on
the
other
side
we
had
all
come
to
the
false
conclusion
that
the
snow
was
accidentally
softer
there
than
elsewhere
bennen
advanced
he
had
made
but
a
few
steps
when
we
heard
a
deep
cutting
sound
the
split
in
two
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
above
us
the
cleft
was
at
first
quite
narrow
not
more
than
an
inch
broad
an
awful
silence
ensued
it
lasted
but
a
few
seconds
and
then
it
was
broken
by
bennen
s
voice
we
are
all
his
words
were
slow
and
solemn
and
those
who
knew
him
felt
what
they
really
meant
when
spoken
by
such
a
man
as
bennen
they
were
his
last
words
i
drove
my
alpenstock
into
the
snow
and
brought
the
weight
of
my
body
to
bear
on
it
i
then
waited
it
was
an
awful
moment
of
suspense
i
turned
my
head
towards
bennen
to
see
whether
he
had
done
the
same
thing
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
him
turn
round
face
the
valley
and
stretch
out
both
arms
the
snow
on
which
we
stood
began
to
move
slowly
and
i
felt
the
utter
uselessness
of
any
alpenstock
i
soon
sank
up
to
my
shoulders
and
began
descending
backwards
from
this
moment
i
saw
nothing
of
what
had
happened
to
the
rest
of
the
party
with
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
succeeded
in
turning
round
the
speed
of
the
avalanche
increased
rapidly
and
before
long
i
was
covered
up
with
snow
i
was
suffocating
when
i
suddenly
came
to
the
surface
again
i
was
on
a
wave
of
the
avalanche
and
saw
it
before
me
as
i
was
carried
down
it
was
the
most
awful
sight
i
ever
saw
the
head
of
the
avalanche
was
already
at
the
spot
where
we
had
made
our
last
halt
the
head
alone
was
preceded
by
a
thick
cloud
of
the
rest
of
the
avalanche
was
clear
around
me
i
heard
the
horrid
hissing
of
the
snow
and
far
before
me
the
thundering
of
the
foremost
part
of
the
avalanche
to
prevent
myself
sinking
again
i
made
use
of
my
arms
much
in
the
same
way
as
when
swimming
in
a
standing
position
at
last
i
noticed
that
i
was
moving
slower
then
i
saw
the
pieces
of
snow
in
front
of
me
stop
at
some
yards
distance
then
the
snow
straight
before
me
stopped
and
i
heard
on
a
large
scale
the
same
creaking
sound
that
is
produced
when
a
heavy
cart
passes
over
frozen
snow
in
winter
i
felt
that
i
also
had
stopped
and
instantly
threw
up
both
arms
to
protect
my
head
in
case
i
should
again
be
covered
up
i
had
stopped
but
the
snow
behind
me
was
still
in
motion
its
pressure
on
my
body
was
so
strong
that
i
thought
i
should
be
crushed
to
death
this
tremendous
pressure
lasted
but
a
short
time
i
was
covered
up
by
snow
coming
from
behind
me
my
first
impulse
was
to
try
and
uncover
my
this
i
could
not
do
the
avalanche
had
frozen
by
pressure
the
moment
it
stopped
and
i
was
frozen
in
whilst
trying
vainly
to
move
my
arms
i
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
hands
as
far
as
the
wrist
had
the
faculty
of
motion
the
conclusion
was
easy
they
must
be
above
the
snow
i
set
to
work
as
well
as
i
could
it
was
time
for
i
could
not
have
held
out
much
longer
at
last
i
saw
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
the
crust
above
my
head
was
getting
thinner
but
i
could
not
reach
it
any
more
with
my
hands
the
idea
struck
me
that
i
might
pierce
it
with
my
breath
after
several
efforts
i
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
felt
suddenly
a
rush
of
air
towards
my
mouth
i
saw
the
sky
again
through
a
little
round
hole
a
dead
silence
reigned
around
me
i
was
so
surprised
to
be
still
alive
and
so
persuaded
at
the
first
moment
that
none
of
my
had
survived
that
i
did
not
even
think
of
shouting
for
them
i
then
made
vain
efforts
to
extricate
my
arms
but
found
it
impossible
the
most
i
could
do
was
to
join
the
ends
of
my
fingers
but
they
could
not
reach
the
snow
any
longer
after
a
few
minutes
i
heard
a
man
shouting
what
a
relief
it
was
to
know
that
i
was
not
the
sole
survivor
to
know
that
perhaps
he
was
not
frozen
in
and
could
come
to
my
assistance
i
answered
the
voice
approached
but
seemed
uncertain
where
to
go
and
yet
it
was
now
quite
near
a
sudden
exclamation
of
surprise
rebot
had
seen
my
hands
he
cleared
my
head
in
an
instant
and
was
about
to
try
and
cut
me
out
completely
when
i
saw
a
foot
above
the
snow
and
so
near
to
me
that
i
could
touch
it
with
my
arms
although
they
were
not
quite
free
yet
i
at
once
tried
to
move
the
foot
it
was
my
poor
friend
s
a
pang
of
agony
shot
through
me
as
i
saw
that
the
foot
did
not
move
poor
had
lost
sensation
and
was
perhaps
already
dead
rebot
did
his
best
after
some
time
he
wished
me
to
help
him
so
he
freed
my
arms
a
little
more
so
that
i
could
make
use
of
them
i
could
do
but
little
for
rebot
had
torn
the
axe
from
my
shoulder
as
soon
as
he
had
cleared
my
head
i
generally
carry
an
axe
separate
from
my
blade
tied
to
the

and

to
the
left
shoulder
before
coming
to
me
rebot
had
helped
nance
out
of
the
snow
he
was
lying
nearly
horizontally
and
was
not
much
covered
over
nance
found
bevard
who
was
upright
in
the
snow
but
covered
up
to
the
head
after
about
twenty
minutes
the
two
guides
came
up
i
was
at
length
taken
out
the
snow
had
to
be
cut
with
the
axe
down
to
my
feet
before
i
could
be
pulled
out
a
few
minutes
after
one
o
clock
we
came
to
my
poor
friend
s
face
i
wished
the
body
to
be
taken
out
completely
but
nothing
could
induce
the
three
guides
to
work
any
longer
from
the
moment
they
saw
that
it
was
too
late
to
save
him
i
acknowledge
that
they
were
nearly
as
incapable
of
doing
anything
as
i
was
when
i
was
taken
out
of
the
snow
the
cord
had
to
be
cut
we
tried
the
end
going
towards
bennen
but
could
not
move
it
it
went
nearly
straight
down
and
showed
us
that
there
was
the
grave
of
the
bravest
guide
the
valais
ever
had
and
ever
will
have
the
cold
had
done
its
work
on
us
we
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
began
the
struck
by
lightning
upon
the
matterhorn
b
heathcote
of
chingford
essex
whilst
attempting
to
ascend
the
matterhorn
by
the
southern
route
was
unfortunately
used
as
a
when
he
was
within
feet
of
the
summit
of
the
mountain
it
may
be
observed
that
the
matterhorn
like
all
isolated
alpine
rock
summits
is
frequently
struck
by
lightning
signor
giordano
has
pointed
out
elsewhere
that
he
found
numerous
traces
of
electric
discharges
upon
its
summit
on
july
in
company
with
peter
perrn
peter
taugwalder
junior
and
jos
maquignaz
i
commenced
the
ascent
the
atmosphere
was
clear
and
the
wind
southerly
when
very
near
to
the
summit
an
extremely
loud
was
heard
and
we
thought
it
prudent
to
descend
we
commenced
the
descent
in
the
following
order
first
myself
next
then
perrn
and
maquignaz
last
on
approaching
the
col
do
felicit√©
i
received
a
sharp
stinging
blow
on
the
leg
and
thought
at
first
that
a
stone
had
been
dislodged
but
a
loud
at
once
told
me
what
it
was
perrn
also
said
that
he
had
been
hit
on
the
leg
in
a
few
moments
i
received
a
hit
on
the
right
arm
which
seemed
to
run
along
it
and
resembled
a
shock
from
a
galvanic
battery
at
the
same
time
all
the
men
gave
a
startled
shriek
and
exclaimed
that
they
were
hit
by
lightning
the
storm
continued
near
us
for
some
little
time
and
then
gradually
died
away
on
arriving
at
the
i
found
that
perrn
had
a
long
sore
on
his
arm
next
morning
his
leg
was
much
swollen
and
very
weak
we
descended
to
breil
on
the
following
day
and
crossed
to
zermatt
the
same
day
my
hand
began
to
swell
and
it
continued
very
weak
for
about
a
week
maquignaz
s
neck
was
much
swollen
on
each
side
the
lightning
hitting
him
according
to
his
account
on
the
back
and
upon
each
side
of
the
neck
taugwalder
s
leg
was
also
slightly
swollen
the
thunder
was
than
i
have
ever
heard
it
before
there
was
no
wind
nor
rain
and
everything
was
in
a
note
to
chapter
vii
it
was
stated
in
the
commencement
of
this
chapter
that
the
pointe
des
ecrins
was
the
highest
mountain
in
france
i
have
learned
since
that
paragraph
was
written
that
captain
mieulet
has
determined
that
the
height
of
the
aiguille
verte
is
feet
that
mountain
is
consequently
feet
higher
than
the
pointe
des
ecrins
and
is
the
highest
in
france
subsequent
history
of
the
matterhorn
the
val
tournanche
natives
who
started
to
facilitate
the
way
up
the
ridge
of
the
matterhorn
for
mm
giordano
and
sella
pitched
their
tent
upon
my
third
platform
at
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
feet
and
enjoyed
several
days
of
bad
weather
under
its
shelter
on
the
first
fine
day
of
july
they
began
their
work
and
about
midday
on
the
got
on
to
the
shoulder
and
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
final
peak
the
point
where
bennen
stopped
on
july
the
counsels
of
the
party
were
then
divided
carrel
and
joseph
to
go
on
the
others
were
not
eager
about
it
a
discussion
took
place
and
the
result
was
they
all
commenced
to
descend
and
whilst
upon
the
cravate
they
heard
our
cries
from
the
summit
upon
the
they
went
down
to
breil
and
reported
their
to
giordano
see
that
gentleman
was
naturally
much
disappointed
and
pressed
the
men
to
set
out
again
said
he
until
now
i
have
striven
for
the
honour
of
making
the
first
ascent
has
decided
against
me
am
beaten
patience
now
if
i
make
further
sacrifices
it
will
be
on
your
account
for
your
honour
and
for
your
interests
will
you
start
again
to
settle
the
question
or
at
least
to
let
there
be
no
more
uncertainty
the
majority
of
the
men
in
fact
the
whole
of
them
with
the
exception
of
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
mountain
carrel
however
stepped
forward
saying
as
for
me
i
have
not
given
it
up
if
you
turning
to
the
abb√©
gorret
or
the
others
will
come
i
will
start
again
not
i
said
one
no
more
for
me
cried
a
second
if
you
would
give
me
a
thousand
francs
i
would
not
go
back
said
a
third
the
abb√©
gorret
alone
volunteered
this
plucky
priest
was
concerned
in
the
very
first
attempts
upon
the
mountain
and
is
an
enthusiastic
mountaineer
carrel
and
the
abb√©
would
have
set
out
by
themselves
had
not
j
bich
and
meynet
two
men
in
the
employ
of
favre
the
innkeeper
come
forward
at
the
last
moment
giordano
also
wished
to
accompany
them
but
the
men
knew
the
nature
of
the
work
they
had
to
undertake
and
positively
declined
to
be
accompanied
by
an
amateur
these
four
men
left
breil
at
on
july
at
arrived
at
the
third
and
there
passed
the
night
at
daybreak
on
the
they
continued
the
ascent
by
the
route
which
had
been
taken
before
passed
successively
the
great
tower
the
cr√™te
du
coq
the
cravate
and
the
shoulder
and
at
gained
the
point
at
the
foot
of
the
final
peak
from
which
the
explorers
had
turned
back
on
the
they
had
then
about
feet
to
accomplish
and
says
the
abb√©
nous
allions
entrer
en
pays
inconnu
aucun
n
√©tant
jamais
all√©
aussi
the
passage
of
the
cleft
which
stopped
bennen
was
accomplished
and
then
the
party
proceeded
directly
towards
the
summit
over
rocks
which
for
some
distance
were
not
particularly
difficult
the
steep
cliffs
down
which
we
had
hurled
stones
on
the
then
stopped
their
way
and
carrel
led
round
to
the
left
or
z
mutt
side
the
work
at
this
part
was
of
the
very
greatest
difficulty
and
stones
and
icicles
which
fell
rendered
the
position
of
the
party
very
precarious
so
much
so
that
they
preferred
to
turn
up
directly
towards
the
summit
and
climb
by
rocks
that
the
abb√©
termed
almost
he
added
this
part
occupied
the
most
time
and
gave
us
the
greatest
at
length
they
arrived
at
a
fault
in
the
rocks
which
formed
a
roughly
horizontal
gallery
they
crept
along
this
in
the
direction
of
a
ridge
that
descended
towards
the
or
thereabouts
and
when
close
to
the
ridge
found
that
they
could
not
climb
on
to
it
but
they
perceived
that
by
descending
a
gully
with
perpendicular
sides
they
could
reach
the
ridge
at
a
lower
point
the
bold
abb√©
was
the
heaviest
and
the
strongest
of
the
four
and
he
was
sacrificed
for
the
success
of
the
expedition
he
and
meynet
remained
behind
and
lowered
the
others
one
by
one
into
the
gully
carrel
and
bich
clambered
up
the
other
side
attained
the
ridge
descending
towards
the
shortly
afterwards
gained
an
easy
route
they
galloped
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
southern
end
of
the
the
time
of
their
arrival
does
not
appear
to
have
been
noticed
it
was
late
in
the
day
i
believe
about
carrel
and
his
comrade
only
waited
long
enough
to
plant
a
flag
by
the
side
of
the
cairn
that
we
had
built
three
days
previously
then
descended
at
once
rejoined
the
others
and
all
four
hurried
down
as
fast
as
possible
to
the
tent
they
were
so
pressed
for
time
that
they
could
not
eat
and
it
was
before
they
arrived
at
their
camp
at
the
foot
of
the
great
tower
in
descending
they
followed
the
gallery
above
mentioned
throughout
its
entire
length
and
so
avoided
the
very
difficult
rocks
over
which
they
had
passed
on
the
ascent
as
they
were
traversing
the
length
of
the
shoulder
they
witnessed
the
phenomenon
to
which
i
have
already
adverted
at
the
foot
of
when
carrel
and
bich
were
near
the
summit
they
saw
our
traces
upon
the
matterhorngletscher
and
suspected
that
an
accident
had
occurred
they
did
not
however
hear
of
the
matterhorn
catastrophe
until
their
return
to
breil
at
upon
the
the
details
of
that
sad
event
were
in
the
mouths
of
all
and
it
was
not
unnaturally
supposed
in
the
absence
of
correct
information
that
the
accident
was
a
proof
that
the
northern
side
was
frightfully
dangerous
the
safe
return
of
the
four
italians
was
regarded
on
the
other
hand
as
evidence
that
the
breil
route
was
the
best
those
who
were
interested
either
personally
or
otherwise
in
the
val
tournanche
made
the
most
of
the
circumstances
and
trumpeted
the
praises
of
the
southern
route
some
went
farther
and
instituted
comparisons
between
the
two
routes
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
northern
one
and
were
pleased
to
term
our
expedition
on
the
of
july
precipitate
and
so
forth
considering
the
circumstances
which
caused
us
to
leave
the
val
tournanche
on
the
of
july
these
remarks
were
not
in
the
best
possible
taste
but
i
have
no
feeling
regarding
them
there
may
be
some
however
who
may
be
interested
in
a
comparison
of
the
two
routes
and
for
their
sakes
i
will
place
the
essential
points
in
juxtaposition
we
that
is
the
taugwalders
and
myself
were
absent
from
zermatt
hours
excluding
halts
and
stoppages
of
one
sort
or
another
the
ascent
and
descent
occupied
us
hours
zermatt
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
the
matterhorn
is
we
had
therefore
to
ascend
feet
as
far
as
the
point
marked
feet
the
way
was
known
so
we
had
to
find
the
way
over
only
feet
the
members
of
our
party
i
now
include
all
were
very
unequal
in
ability
and
none
of
us
could
for
a
moment
be
compared
as
cragsmen
with
carrel
the
four
italians
who
started
from
breil
on
the
of
july
were
absent
during
hours
and
as
far
as
i
can
gather
from
the
published
account
and
from
conversation
with
the
men
excluding
halts
they
took
for
the
ascent
and
descent
hours
the
hotel
at
breil
is
feet
above
the
sea
so
they
had
to
ascend
feet
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
shoulder
the
way
was
known
to
carrel
and
he
had
to
find
the
way
over
only
about
feet
all
four
men
were
born
mountaineers
good
climbers
and
they
were
led
by
the
most
expert
cragsman
i
have
seen
the
weather
in
each
instance
was
fine
it
is
seen
therefore
that
these
four
nearly
equally
matched
men
took
a
time
to
ascend
feet
height
than
ourselves
although
we
had
to
find
the
way
over
more
than
four
times
as
much
untrodden
ground
as
they
this
alone
would
lead
any
mountaineer
to
suppose
that
their
route
must
have
been
more
difficult
than
ours
i
know
the
greater
part
of
the
ground
over
which
they
passed
and
from
my
knowledge
and
from
the
account
of
grove
i
am
sure
that
their
route
was
not
only
more
difficult
but
that
it
was
more
difficult
than
ours
this
was
not
the
opinion
in
the
val
tournanche
at
the
end
of
and
the
natives
confidently
reckoned
that
tourists
would
flock
to
their
side
in
preference
to
the
other
it
was
i
believe
the
late
canon
carrel
of
aosta
who
always
took
great
interest
in
such
matters
who
first
proposed
the
construction
of
a
upon
the
southern
side
of
the
matterhorn
the
project
was
taken
up
with
spirit
and
funds
for
its
execution
were
speedily
by
the
members
of
the
italian
alpine
club
or
by
their
friends
the
indefatigable
carrel
found
a
natural
hole
upon
the
ledge
called
the
cravate
and
this
in
course
of
time
was
turned
under
his
direction
into
a
respectable
little
hut
its
position
is
superb
and
gives
a
view
of
the
most
magnificent
character
whilst
this
work
was
being
carried
out
my
friend
craufurd
grove
consulted
me
respecting
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
i
recommended
him
to
ascend
by
the
northern
route
and
to
place
himself
in
the
hands
of
carrel
grove
found
however
that
carrel
distinctly
preferred
the
southern
side
and
they
ascended
accordingly
by
the
breil
route
grove
has
been
good
enough
to
supply
the
following
account
of
his
expedition
he
carries
on
my
description
of
the
southern
route
from
the
highest
point
i
attained
on
that
side
a
little
below
the
cravate
to
the
summit
and
thus
renders
complete
my
descriptions
of
the
two
sides
in
august
i
ascended
the
matterhorn
from
breil
taking
as
guides
three
mountaineers
of
the
val
carrel
bich
and
meynet
being
the
leader
at
that
time
the
matterhorn
had
not
been
scaled
since
the
famous
expedition
of
the
italian
guides
mentioned
above
our
route
was
identical
with
that
which
they
followed
in
their
descent
when
as
will
be
seen
they
struck
out
on
one
part
of
the
mountain
a
different
line
from
that
which
they
had
taken
in
ascending
after
gaining
the
col
du
lion
we
climbed
the
or
breil
by
the
route
which
has
been
described
in
these
pages
passing
the
night
at
the
then
unfinished
hut
constructed
by
the
italian
alpine
club
on
the
starting
from
the
hut
at
daylight
we
reached
at
an
early
hour
the
summit
of
the
shoulder
and
then
traversed
its
to
the
final
peak
of
the
matterhorn
the
passage
of
this
was
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
the
whole
expedition
the
ridge
worn
by
slow
irregular
decay
into
monstrous
and
rugged
battlements
and
guarded
on
each
side
by
tremendous
precipices
is
grand
beyond
all
description
but
does
not
strange
to
say
present
any
remarkable
difficulty
to
the
climber
save
that
it
is
exceedingly
trying
to
the
head
great
care
is
of
course
necessary
but
the
scramble
is
by
no
means
of
so
arduous
a
nature
as
entirely
to
absorb
the
attention
so
that
a
fine
climb
and
rock
scenery
of
grandeur
perhaps
unparalleled
in
the
alps
can
both
be
appreciated
it
was
near
the
end
of
this
close
to
the
place
where
it
abuts
against
the
final
peak
that
professor
tyndall
s
party
turned
in
arrested
by
a
cleft
in
the
ridge
from
the
point
where
they
stopped
the
main
tower
of
the
matterhorn
rises
in
front
of
the
climber
abrupt
magnificent
and
apparently
inaccessible
the
summit
is
fully
feet
in
vertical
height
above
this
spot
and
certainly
to
my
eye
appeared
to
be
separated
from
me
by
a
yet
more
considerable
interval
for
i
remember
when
at
the
end
of
the
looking
upward
at
the
crest
of
the
mountain
and
thinking
that
it
must
be
a
good
feet
above
me
when
the
italian
guides
made
their
splendid
ascent
they
traversed
the
of
the
shoulder
to
the
main
peak
passed
the
cleft
which
has
been
mentioned
clambered
on
to
the
tremendous
face
of
the
mountain
described
by
whymper
at
pp
and
and
then
endeavoured
to
cross
this
face
so
as
to
get
on
to
the
z
mutt
the
passage
of
this
slope
proved
a
work
of
great
difficulty
and
danger
i
saw
it
from
very
near
the
place
which
they
traversed
and
was
unable
to
conceive
how
any
human
creatures
managed
to
crawl
over
rocks
so
steep
and
so
treacherous
after
they
had
got
about
across
they
found
the
difficulties
of
the
route
and
the
danger
from
falling
stones
so
great
that
they
struck
straight
up
the
mountain
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
safer
way
they
were
to
a
certain
extent
successful
for
they
came
presently
to
a
small
ledge
caused
by
a
sort
of
fault
in
the
rock
running
horizontally
across
the
face
of
the
mountain
a
little
distance
below
the
summit
traversing
this
ledge
the
italians
found
themselves
close
to
the
z
mutt
but
still
separated
from
it
by
a
barrier
to
outflank
which
it
was
necessary
to
descend
a
perpendicular
gully
carrel
and
bich
were
lowered
down
this
the
other
two
men
remaining
at
the
top
to
haul
up
their
companions
on
their
return
as
otherwise
they
could
not
have
got
up
again
passing
on
to
the
z
mutt
without
further
difficulty
carrel
and
bich
climbed
by
that
ridge
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
in
returning
the
italians
kept
to
the
ledge
for
the
whole
distance
across
the
face
and
descended
to
the
place
where
the
of
the
shoulder
abuts
against
the
main
peak
by
a
sort
of
rough
ridge
of
rocks
between
the
and
southern
faces
when
i
ascended
in
we
followed
this
route
in
the
ascent
and
in
the
descent
i
thought
the
ledge
difficult
in
some
places
decidedly
dangerous
and
should
not
care
to
set
foot
on
it
again
but
assuredly
it
neither
is
so
difficult
nor
so
continuously
dangerous
as
those
gaunt
and
pitiless
which
the
italians
crossed
in
their
upward
route
illustration
the
hut
cabane
on
the
zermatt
side
of
the
matterhorn
from
a
photograph
by
the
author
the
credit
of
making
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
belongs
undoubtedly
to
carrel
and
to
the
other
mountaineers
who
accompanied
him
bennen
led
his
party
bravely
and
skilfully
to
a
point
some
feet
below
the
top
from
this
point
however
good
guide
though
he
was
bennen
had
to
retire
defeated
and
it
was
reserved
for
the
better
of
the
valtournanche
guide
to
win
the
difficult
way
to
the
summit
of
the
craufurd
grove
was
the
first
traveller
who
ascended
the
matterhorn
after
the
accident
and
the
natives
of
val
tournanche
were
of
course
greatly
delighted
that
his
ascent
was
made
upon
their
side
some
of
them
however
were
by
no
means
well
pleased
that
carrel
was
so
much
regarded
they
feared
perhaps
that
he
would
acquire
the
monopoly
of
the
mountain
just
a
month
after
grove
s
ascent
six
valtournanchians
set
out
to
see
whether
they
could
not
learn
the
route
and
so
come
in
for
a
share
of
the
good
things
which
were
expected
to
arrive
they
were
three
maquignaz
s
c√¶sar
carrel
my
old
guide
carrel
and
a
daughter
of
the
last
named
they
left
breil
at
on
and
at
arrived
at
the
hut
where
they
passed
the
night
at
the
next
day
they
started
again
leaving
carrel
behind
and
proceeded
along
the
shoulder
to
the
final
peak
passed
the
cleft
which
had
stopped
bennen
and
clambered
up
the
comparatively
easy
rocks
on
the
other
side
until
they
arrived
at
the
base
of
the
last
precipice
down
which
we
had
hurled
stones
on
july
they
young
woman
and
all
were
then
about
feet
from
the
summit
then
instead
of
turning
to
the
left
as
carrel
and
grove
had
done
joseph
and
maquignaz
paid
attention
to
the
cliff
in
front
of
them
and
managed
to
find
a
means
of
passing
up
by
clefts
ledges
and
gullies
to
the
summit
this
was
a
shorter
and
it
appears
to
be
an
easier
route
than
that
taken
by
carrel
and
grove
and
it
has
been
followed
by
all
those
who
have
since
then
ascended
the
mountain
from
the
side
of
breil
subsequently
a
rope
was
fixed
over
the
most
difficult
portions
of
the
final
climb
in
the
meantime
they
had
not
been
idle
upon
the
other
side
a
hut
was
constructed
upon
the
eastern
face
at
a
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
near
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
which
descends
towards
zermatt
ridge
this
was
done
at
the
expense
of
monsieur
seiler
and
of
the
swiss
alpine
club
mons
seiler
placed
the
execution
of
the
work
under
the
direction
of
the
knubels
of
the
village
of
nicholas
in
the
zermatt
valley
and
peter
knubel
along
with
joseph
marie
lochmatter
of
the
same
village
had
the
honour
of
making
the
second
ascent
of
the
mountain
upon
the
northern
side
with
elliott
this
took
place
on
july
since
then
very
numerous
ascents
have
been
made
both
on
the
swiss
and
upon
the
italian
side
the
list
of
ascents
will
however
show
that
far
more
have
been
made
by
the
zermatt
or
northern
route
than
by
the
breil
or
southern
route
illustration
the
chapel
at
the
schwarzsee
elliott
supposed
that
he
avoided
the
place
where
the
accident
occurred
and
that
he
improved
the
northern
route
this
however
is
not
the
case
both
he
and
the
others
who
have
succeeded
him
have
followed
in
all
essential
points
the
route
which
we
took
upon
july
with
the
exception
of
the
deviations
which
i
will
point
out
upon
leaving
zermatt
the
traveller
commences
by
crossing
a
bridge
which
is
commonly
termed
the
matterhorn
bridge
and
proceeds
to
the
chapel
at
the
schwarzsee
thence
he
mounts
the
h√∂rnli
and
follows
its
ridge
along
its
entire
length
right
up
to
the
foot
of
the
matterhorn
there
is
now
a
good
path
along
the
whole
of
this
ridge
but
when
we
traversed
it
for
the
first
ascent
there
was
not
even
so
much
as
a
faintly
marked
track
the
first
steps
which
are
taken
upon
the
mountain
itself
follow
the
exact
line
over
which
i
myself
led
upon
the
first
ascent
and
the
track
presently
passes
over
the
precise
spot
upon
which
our
tent
was
placed
in
in
and
again
in
i
saw
the
initials
which
i
marked
on
the
rock
by
the
side
of
our
tent
the
route
now
taken
passes
this
rock
and
then
goes
round
the
corner
of
the
buttress
to
which
i
referred
upon
at
this
point
the
route
now
followed
deviates
somewhat
from
the
line
of
our
ascent
and
goes
more
directly
up
to
the
part
of
the
ridge
upon
which
the
is
placed
we
bore
more
away
on
to
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
proceeded
more
directly
towards
the
summit
at
the
upper
part
of
the
ascent
of
the
ridge
the
route
now
taken
is
exactly
that
of
the
first
ascent
until
the
foot
of
the
final
peak
is
reached
and
there
instead
of
bearing
away
to
the
right
as
we
did
the
tourist
now
clambers
up
directly
towards
the
summit
by
means
of
the
fixed
ropes
and
chains
the
final
portion
of
the
ascent
over
the
snow
at
the
summit
again
follows
our
route
illustration
the
summit
of
the
matterhorn
in
northern
end
so
far
as
the
there
is
now
a
strongly
marked
track
almost
a
path
over
the
mountain
and
little
piles
of
stones
placed
in
prominent
situations
point
out
the
way
even
to
the
dullest
person
what
the
itself
is
like
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
illustration
which
faces
it
is
placed
in
a
very
insecure
position
and
will
probably
one
of
these
days
disappear
by
disintegration
it
is
not
easy
at
this
part
of
the
mountain
to
find
a
good
situation
for
a
hut
though
there
is
plenty
of
choice
both
higher
up
and
lower
down
amongst
the
ascents
that
have
been
made
which
are
most
worthy
of
note
that
made
by
signor
giordano
may
be
mentioned
first
this
gentleman
came
to
breil
several
times
after
his
famous
visit
in
with
the
intention
of
making
the
ascent
but
he
was
always
baffled
by
the
weather
in
july
he
got
as
high
as
the
cravate
with
j
carrel
and
other
men
and
detained
there
five
days
and
nights
unable
to
move
either
up
or
at
last
upon
he
was
able
to
gratify
his
desires
and
accomplished
the
feat
of
ascending
the
mountain
on
one
side
and
descending
it
upon
the
other
signor
giordano
is
i
believe
the
only
geologist
who
has
ascended
the
mountain
he
spent
a
considerable
time
in
the
examination
of
its
structure
and
became
benighted
on
its
eastern
face
in
consequence
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
the
valuable
note
and
the
accompanying
section
which
follow
the
table
of
ascents
signor
giordano
carried
a
mercurial
barometer
throughout
the
entire
distance
and
read
it
frequently
his
observations
have
enabled
me
to
determine
with
confidence
and
accuracy
the
heights
which
were
attained
upon
the
different
attempts
to
ascend
the
mountain
and
the
various
points
upon
it
which
have
been
so
frequently
mentioned
throughout
this
volume
questions
having
been
frequently
put
to
me
respecting
the
immediate
summit
of
the
matterhorn
and
difficulties
having
been
expressed
as
to
the
recognition
of
the
two
views
given
upon
pp
and
i
made
an
ascent
of
the
mountain
in
to
photograph
the
summit
in
order
that
i
might
see
what
changes
had
occurred
since
our
visit
of
ten
years
before
the
summits
of
all
high
mountains
vary
from
time
to
time
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
the
matterhorn
was
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
it
was
altogether
sharper
and
narrower
in
than
instead
of
being
able
to
run
about
every
step
had
to
be
painfully
cut
with
the
axe
and
the
immediate
summit
instead
of
being
a
blunt
and
rounded
eminence
was
a
little
cone
of
snow
which
went
to
a
very
sharp
point
our
photographic
operations
were
conducted
with
difficulty
for
a
furious
north
wind
was
blowing
which
would
have
whisked
away
the
camera
immediately
if
it
had
been
set
up
in
the
most
convenient
position
for
taking
a
view
and
we
were
compelled
to
cut
a
great
gash
in
the
snow
and
to
work
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
cliff
overlooking
breil
before
we
could
escape
from
the
gusts
which
were
whirling
away
the
snow
in
writhing
eddies
my
guides
j
carrel
bic
and
lochmatter
formed
a
strong
party
and
eventually
we
gained
a
position
protected
from
the
wind
whence
there
was
a
good
view
of
the
summit
but
our
ledge
was
so
small
that
we
could
not
venture
to
unrope
and
carrel
had
to
squat
down
whilst
i
photographed
over
his
head
the
engraving
upon
has
been
made
from
the
photograph
so
taken
it
will
interest
some
of
my
readers
to
know
that
the
nearest
peak
seen
below
is
the
summit
of
the
dent
d
h√©rens
the
light
was
not
favourable
for
photographing
the
when
we
returned
from
the
summit
and
i
stopped
alone
with
carrel
in
it
for
a
second
night
in
order
to
get
the
morning
light
on
the
next
day
whilst
quietly
reposing
inside
i
was
startled
to
hear
a
rustling
and
crackling
sound
and
jumped
up
expecting
that
the
building
was
about
to
take
itself
off
to
lower
quarters
and
presently
i
perceived
that
the
hut
had
a
tenant
to
whom
i
certainly
did
not
expect
to
be
introduced
a
little
plump
mouse
came
creeping
out
over
the
floor
being
apparently
of
opinion
that
there
ought
not
to
be
any
one
there
at
that
time
of
day
it
wandered
about
picking
up
stray
fragments
of
food
occasionally
crunching
a
bit
of
totally
unaware
of
my
presence
for
i
made
out
that
the
little
animal
was
both
blind
and
deaf
it
would
have
been
easy
to
capture
it
but
i
would
not
do
so
and
left
it
there
to
keep
company
with
other
solitary
tourists
the
view
from
the
extends
from
the
bietschhorn
on
the
north
to
the
grand
tournalin
in
the
south
and
includes
the
mischabel
group
the
allalleinhorn
and
alphubel
mont
rosa
etc
etc
its
situation
is
not
high
enough
to
overlook
those
mountains
and
so
the
prospect
is
very
similar
to
the
northern
and
eastern
half
of
the
view
from
the
riffel
the
uppermost
feet
of
the
matterhorn
can
be
seen
from
the
hut
but
the
rest
of
the
part
above
it
is
not
visible
being
hidden
by
a
small
ridge
which
projects
from
the
face
whilst
stopping
in
the
we
had
the
insecurity
of
its
position
forcibly
impressed
upon
us
by
seeing
a
huge
block
break
away
from
the
rock
at
its
side
and
go
crashing
down
over
the
very
route
which
is
commonly
pursued
by
tourists
the
year
is
a
memorable
one
in
the
history
of
the
matterhorn
for
in
it
there
occurred
two
deaths
upon
the
mountain
and
two
new
routes
were
discovered
sufficient
information
has
not
come
to
hand
at
the
time
i
write
upon
what
is
termed
the
to
enable
one
to
form
a
correct
opinion
about
that
lamentable
business
and
it
is
enough
to
say
that
upon
august
a
party
started
from
breil
composed
of
l√ºscher
schiess
and
the
guides
lochmatter
jos
brantschen
and
petryson
of
evolena
they
gained
the
hut
on
the
cravate
in
due
course
and
on
the
following
day
the
party
crossed
the
mountain
to
zermatt
with
the
exception
of
brantschen
who
was
left
behind
in
the
hut
some
say
only
slightly
ill
and
others
at
the
point
of
death
which
of
these
was
the
case
is
only
known
by
those
concerned
they
sent
back
assistance
to
their
comrade
in
a
somewhat
tardy
fashion
and
when
the
relief
party
gained
the
hut
brantschen
was
found
dead
at
the
time
that
this
was
taking
place
on
the
southern
side
of
the
matterhorn
an
accident
occurred
on
the
face
by
which
a
life
was
lost
craven
and
moseley
of
boston
with
the
guides
peter
rubi
and
inabnit
left
zermatt
at
on
the
night
of
august
and
ascended
the
mountain
by
the
usual
northern
route
without
stopping
at
the
hut
they
reached
the
summit
at
on
the
and
had
returned
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
hut
when
moseley
who
had
found
it
irksome
to
be
tied
up
and
had
frequently
wished
to
go
unroped
untied
himself
from
the
rest
doing
so
entirely
upon
his
own
responsibility
a
few
minutes
later
and
within
quite
a
short
distance
of
the
hut
the
party
had
to
cross
a
projecting
piece
of
rock
rubi
went
over
first
and
planted
his
axe
in
position
to
give
firm
footing
to
moseley
who
followed
but
unhappily
he
declined
assistance
placed
his
hand
on
the
rock
and
endeavoured
to
vault
over
it
in
doing
so
he
slipped
lost
hold
of
his
axe
and
fell
with
ever
accelerating
velocity
down
almost
the
whole
of
the
face
he
fell
about
feet
and
was
of
course
killed
on
the
spot
his
body
was
recovered
three
days
later
and
was
interred
in
the
english
at
zermatt
many
persons
have
talked
at
different
times
about
the
possibility
of
finding
a
way
up
the
matterhorn
from
the
side
of
the
z
mutt
glacier
but
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
a
way
was
found
on
september
mummery
with
the
guides
and
succeeded
in
gaining
the
summit
by
first
going
up
the
long
buttress
of
snow
which
runs
out
from
the
mountain
to
the
z
mutt
glacier
and
then
up
the
rocks
above
i
have
been
unable
to
procure
any
details
respecting
this
expedition
and
my
only
information
about
it
has
been
derived
from
baumann
who
followed
in
mummery
s
traces
three
days
later
baumann
says
we
followed
the
long
to
its
extreme
upper
end
then
the
jagged
ar√™te
above
it
for
a
short
distance
and
then
deviated
a
little
to
the
right
climbing
by
a
secondary
rocky
ridge
descending
towards
the
stockhi
until
within
an
hour
of
the
summit
when
we
struck
the
main
z
mutt
ar√™te
and
so
completed
the
ascent
by
joining
the
breil
at
the
very
time
that
mummery
was
occupied

his
expedition

and
sorbriehen
was
engaged
in
a
similar
enterprise
and
also
ascended
the
matterhorn
from
the
direction
of
the
stockhi
he
however
at
the
first
took
a
route
closer
to
the
tiefenmatten
glacier
though
he
at
last
like
the
others
eventually
got
upon
the
main
z
mutt
ar√™te
and
completed
the
ascent
by
following
a
portion
of
the
breil
route
neither
mummery
nor
baumann
and
penhall
descended
by
the
routes
which
they
struck
out
and
in
each
case
the
respective
parties
descended
by
the
northern
or
zermatt
route
it
is
therefore
at
present
impossible
to
determine
the
relative
difficulty
of
the
various
routes
up
the
mountain
still
i
think
that
the
great
majority
of
tourists
will
as
heretofore
prefer
the
ordinary
zermatt
route
and
that
comparatively
few
will
patronize
the
ones
the
ascent
of
the
matterhorn
has
now
taken
its
place
amongst
those
which
are
considered
fashionable
and
many
persons
get
upon
it
who
ought
not
to
be
upon
a
mountain
at
all
although
much
has
been
done
on
both
sides
of
it
to
facilitate
the
routes
and
although
they
are
much
easier
to
traverse
than
they
were
in
years
gone
by
it
is
still
quite
possible
to
get
into
trouble
upon
them
and
to
come
utterly
to
grief
considering
how
large
a
number
of
entirely
incompetent
persons
venture
upon
the
mountain
it
is
surprising
so
few
meet
with
accidents
but
if
the
number
of
accidents
continues
to
increase
at
its
present
rate
it
will
ere
long
not
be
easy
to
find
a
place
of

however
found

learned

got
considerably
higher
than

about

feet
higher
than

tyndall

bennen
were
mistaken
in
supposing
that
the
mountain
has
two
summits
it
has
only
one
they
seem
to
have
been
deceived
by
the
appearance
of
that
part
of
the
ridge
which
is
called
the
shoulder
l
√©paule
as
seen
from

viewed
from
that
place
its
southern
end
has
certainly
through
foreshortening
the
semblance
of
a
peak
but
when
one
regards
it
from
the
col
th√©odule
or
from
any
place
in
the

direction
the
delusion
is
at
once
apparent
the
late
principal
forbes
was
similarly
situated
while
crossing
the
same
pass
in
he
described
the
sounds
as
rustling
fizzing
and
hissing

his
in

alps
of
second
spence
watson
experienced
the
same
upon

upper
part
of

aletsch
glacier
in
july

he
spoke

the
sounds

the
the
respective
parties
seem
to
have
been
highly
electrified
on
each
occasion
forbes
says
that
his
fingers
yielded
a
fizzing
sound

watson
says
that
his
hair
stood
on
end
in
an
uncomfortable
but
very
amusing
manner
and
that
the
veil
on
the
of
one
of
the
party
stood
upright

have
described
this
tent
at
length
as
frequent
application
has
been
made
to
me
for
information
on
the
subject
i
would
strongly
recommend
any
person
who
wishes
to
have
one
for
use
to
have
one
made
under
his
own
eye
and
to
be
particularly
careful
to
test
the
poles
my
experience
goes
to
show
that
poles
which
when
supported
upon
their
extremities
will
bear
a
dead
weight

greatest
height
very
few
lichens
are
seen
on
the
higher
parts
of
this
mountain
their
rarity
is
due
doubtless
to
the
constant
disintegration
of
the
rocks
and
the
consequent
exposure
of
fresh
surfaces
was
the
highest
plant
found
by
de

on
his
travels
in

that
he
found
a
tuft
near

from

respectively
for
many
years
in

have
favoured
me
with
the
names
of
the
highest
plants
that
they
have
obtained
upon
their
excursions
their
lists
although
not
extensive
are
interesting
as
showing
the
extreme
limits
attained
by
some
of
the
hardiest
of
alpine
plants
those
mentioned
by

on
the

part
first
in
the

of
the
swiss
alpine
club
it
is
stated
that
on
an
ascent
of
the
finsteraarhorn
feet
the
following
were
collected
within
the
last
feet
and
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
the
rapid
changes
which
occur
in
the
weather
at
considerable
elevations
in
the
alps
and
shall
have
to
do
so
again
in
subsequent
chapters
no
one
can
regret
more
than
myself
the
variable
weather
which
afflicts
that
otherwise
delightful
chain
of
mountains
or
the
necessity
of
speaking
about
it
its
summits
appear
to
enjoy
more
than
their
fair
share
of
wind
and
tempests
meteorological
disturbances
some
would
say
are
by
no
means
necessary
accompaniments
of
high
regions
there
are
some
happy
places
which
are
said
to
be
favoured
with
almost
perpetual
calm
take
the
case
of
the
sierra
nevada
of
california
for
example
which
includes
numerous
summits
from
to
feet
whitney
of
san
francisco
says
in
his
to
the
yosemite
valley
and
the
adjacent
at
high
altitudes
all
through
the
mountains
the
weather
during
the
summer
is
almost
always
the
finest
possible
for
travelling
there
are
occasional
storms
in
the
high
mountains
but
in
ordinary
seasons
these
are
quite
rare
and
one
of
the
greatest
drawbacks
to
the
pleasure
of
travelling
in
the
alps
the
uncertainty
of
the
weather
is
here
almost
entirely
it
is
probable
that
a
more
thorough
acquaintance
with
that
region
will
modify
this
opinion
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
judge
of
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
at
great
heights
from
the
valleys
and
it
often
occurs
that
a
terrific
storm
is
raging
above
when
there
is
a
dead
calm
below
at
a
distance
perhaps
of
not
more
than
three
or
four
miles
a
case
of
this
kind
is
described
in
chapter
and
another
may
be
mentioned
here
at
the
very
time
that
i
was
regarding
the
dent
blanche
from
a
height
of
feet
on
the
matterhorn
kennedy
was
engaged
in
making
the
first
ascent
of
the
former
mountain
he
described
his
ascent
in
a
very
picturesque
paper
in
the
and
i
learn
from
it
that
he
experienced
severe
weather
the
wind
roared
over
our
ridge
making
fearfully
wild
music
among
the
desolate
crags
it
rendered
an
ordinary
voice
inaudible
and
nothing
at
a
distance
greater
than
fifty
yards
could
be
seen
at
all
thick
mists
and
driving
clouds
of
snow
swept
over
and
past
us
the
thermometer
fell
to
and
his
companion
s
hair
became
a
mass
of
white
icicles
now
at
this
time
kennedy
was
distant
from
me
only
four
and
a
half
miles
with
me
and
in
my
immediate
neighbourhood
the
air
was
perfectly
calm
and
the
temperature
was
agreeably
warm
even
during
the
night
it
fell
only
two
or
three
degrees
below
during
most
of
the
day
the
dent
blanche
was
perfectly
unclouded
though
for
a
time
light
fleecy
clouds
were
hovering
about
its
upper
feet
still
no
one
would
have
supposed
from
appearances
that
my
friend
was
experiencing
a
storm
such
as
he
has
described
see
the
engraving
crags
of
the
matterhorn
facing
a
remarkable
streak
of
snow
marked
cravate
in
the
outline
of
the
matterhorn
as
seen
from
the
th√©odule
runs
across
the
cliff
at
this
part
of
the
mountain
my
highest
point
was
somewhat
higher
than
the
lowest
part
of
this
snow
and
was
consequently
about
feet
above
the
sea
i
received
much
attention
from
a
kind
english
lady
who
was
staying
in
the
inn
as
it
seldom
happens
that
one
survives
such
a
fall
it
may
be
interesting
to
record
what
my
sensations
were
during
its
occurrence
i
was
perfectly
conscious
of
what
was
happening
and
felt
each
blow
but
like
a
patient
under
chloroform
experienced
no
pain
each
blow
was
naturally
more
severe
than
that
which
preceded
it
and
i
distinctly
remember
thinking
well
if
the
next
is
harder
still
that
will
be
the
end
like
persons
who
have
been
rescued
from
drowning
i
remember
that
the
recollection
of
a
multitude
of
things
rushed
through
my
head
many
of
them
trivialities
or
absurdities
which
had
been
forgotten
long
before
and
more
remarkable
this
bounding
through
space
did
not
feel
disagreeable
but
i
think
that
in
no
very
great
distance
more
consciousness
as
well
as
sensation
would
have
been
lost
and
upon
that
i
base
my
belief
improbable
as
it
seems
that
death
by
a
fall
from
a
great
height
is
as
painless
an
end
as
can
be
experienced
the
battering
was
very
rough
yet
no
bones
were
broken
the
most
severe
cuts
were
one
of
four
inches
long
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
another
of
three
inches
on
the
right
temple
this
latter
bled
frightfully
there
was
a
cut
of
about
the
same
size
as
the
last
on
the
palm
of
the
left
hand
and
every
limb
was
grazed
or
cut
more
or
less
seriously
the
tips
of
the
ears
were
taken
off
and
a
sharp
rock
cut
a
circular
bit
out
of
the
side
of
the
left
boot
sock
and
ankle
at
one
stroke
the
loss
of
blood
although
so
great
did
not
seem
to
be
permanently
injurious
the
only
serious
effect
has
been
the
reduction
of
a
naturally
retentive
memory
to
a
very
one
and
although
my
recollections
of
more
distant
occurrences
remain
unshaken
the
events
of
that
particular
day
would
be
clean
gone
but
for
the
few
notes
which
were
written
down
before
the
accident
an
incident
like
this
goes
far
to
make
one
look
favourably
upon
the
of
chamounix
and
other
places
this
could
not
have
occurred
at
chamounix
nor
here
if
there
had
been
a
des
this
appeared
to
be
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
mountain
one
was
driven
to
keep
to
the
edge
of
the
ridge
or
very
near
to
it
and
at
the
point
where
we
turned
back
which
was
almost
as
high
as
the
part
of
the
cravate
and
perhaps
feet
higher
than
my
scramble
on
the
there
were
smooth
walls
seven
or
eight
feet
high
in
every
direction
which
were
impassable
to
a
single
man
and
which
could
only
be
surmounted
by
the
assistance
of
ladders
or
by
using
one
s
comrades
as
ladders
see
appendix
professor
tyndall
describes
this
incident
in
the
following
words
we
had
gathered
up
our
traps
and
bent
to
the
work
before
us
when
suddenly
an
explosion
occurred
overhead
we
looked
aloft
and
saw
in
a
solid
shot
from
the
matterhorn
describing
its
proper
parabola
and
finally
splitting
into
fragments
as
it
smote
one
of
the
rocky
towers
in
front
down
the
shattered
fragments
came
like
a
kind
of
spray
slightly
wide
of
us
but
still
near
enough
to
compel
a
sharp
two
or
three
such
explosions
occurred
but
we
chose
the
back
fin
of
the
mountain
for
our
track
and
from
this
the
falling
stones
were
speedily
deflected
right
or
reprinted
in
s
april
saturday
august
the
pinnacle
in
fact
had
a
name
l
ange
saturday
and
s
i
have
entered
into
this
matter
because
much
surprise
has
been
expressed
that
carrel
was
able
to
pass
this
place
without
any
great
difficulty
in
which
turned
back
so
strong
a
party
in
the
cause
of
professor
tyndall
s
defeat
was
simply
that
his
second
guide
walter
did
not
give
aid
to
bennen
when
it
was
required
and
that
the
carrels
not
act
as
guides
after
having
been
hired
as
carrel
not
only
knew
of
the
existence
of
this
place
before
they
came
to
it
but
always
believed
in
the
possibility
of
passing
it
and
of
ascending
the
mountain
and
had
he
been
leader
to
the
party
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
might
have
taken
tyndall
to
the
top
but
when
appealed
to
to
assist
bennen
a
swiss
and
the
recognised
leader
of
the
party
was
it
likely
that
he
an
italian
a
porter
who
intended
to
be
the
first
man
up
the
mountain
by
a
route
which
he
regarded
peculiarly
his
own
would
render
any
aid
it
is
not
so
easy
to
understand
how
tyndall
and
bennen
overlooked
the
existence
of
this
cleft
for
it
is
seen
over
several
points
of
the
compass
and
particularly
well
from
the
southern
side
of
the
th√©odule
pass
still
more
difficult
is
it
to
explain
how
the
professor
came
to
consider
that
he
was
only
a
stone
from
the
summit
for
when
he
got
to
the
end
of
the
shoulder
he
must
have
been
perfectly
aware
that
the
whole
height
of
the
final
peak
was
still
above
him
tyndall
ascended
the
matterhorn
in
see

information
upon
the
val

and
in
king
s
valleys
of
the
pp
i
shall
speak
again
of
this
mountain
and
therefore
pass
it
over
for
the
present
see
the
map
of
the
matterhorn
and
its
glaciers
my
attention
was
directed
to
this
note
by
the
summit
of
the
th√©odule
pass
is
feet
above
the
sea
it
is
estimated
that
of
late
about
a
thousand
tourists
have
crossed
it
per
annum
in
the
winter
when
the
crevasses
are
bridged
over
and
partially
filled
up
and
the
weather
is
favourable
cows
and
sheep
pass
over
it
from
zermatt
to
val
tournanche
and
in
the
of
august
de
saussure
appears
to
have
taken
mules
from
breil
over
the
val
tournanche
glacier
to
the
summit
of
the
th√©odule
and
on
a
previous
journey
he
did
the
same
also
in
the
middle
of
august
he
distinctly
mentions
that
the
glacier
was
completely
covered
with
snow
and
that
crevasses
were
open
i
do
not
think
mules
could
have
been
taken
over
the
same
spot
in
any
august
during
the
past
twenty
years
without
great
difficulty
in
that
month
the
glacier
is
usually
very
bare
of
snow
and
many
crevasses
are
open
they
are
easily
enough
avoided
by
those
on
foot
but
would
prove
very
troublesome
to
mules
a
few
days
before
we
crossed
the
breuiljoch
in
morshead
made
a
parallel
pass
to
it
he
crossed
the
ridge
on
the
side
of
the
little
peak
and
followed
a
somewhat
more
difficult
route
than
ours
in
i
wanted
to
use
morshead
s
pass
see
but
found
that
it
was
not
possible
to
descend
the
zermatt
side
for
during
the
two
years
which
had
elapsed
the
glacier
had
shrunk
so
much
that
it
was
completely
severed
from
the
summit
of
the
pass
and
we
could
not
get
down
the
rocks
that
were
exposed
although
the
admirable
situation
of
zermatt
has
been
known
for
at
least
forty
years
it
is
only
within
the
last
twenty
or
so
that
it
has
become
an
approved
alpine
centre
thirty
years
ago
the
th√©odule
pass
the
weissthor
and
the
col
d
h√©rens
were
i
believe
the
only
routes
ever
taken
from
zermatt
across
the
pennine
alps
at
the
present
time
there
are
inclusive
of
these
passes
and
of
the
valley
road
no
less
than
different
ways
in
which
a
tourist
may
go
from
zermatt
the
summits
of
some
of
these
cols
are
more
than
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
a
good
many
of
them
can
not
be
recommended
either
for
ease
or
as
offering
the
shortest
way
from
zermatt
to
the
valleys
and
villages
to
which
they
lead
zermatt
itself
is
still
only
a
village

inhabitants
about
forty
of

black
with

the

mostly
belong
to

the

the
north
to

nearly
in

passed
above

led
them

portrait
of
this
enthusiastic
and
worthy
mountaineer
is
given
upon
a
brief
account
of
this

published
in

august
this
incident

close
to
the

represented
in
the
engraving
facing
the
new
dry
snow
was
very
troublesome
and
poured
down
like
flour
into
the
steps
which
were
cut
across
the
slopes
the
front
man
accordingly
moved
ahead
as
far
as
possible
and
anchored
himself
to
rocks
a
rope
was
sent
across
to
him
was
fixed
at
each
end
and
was
held
as
a
rail
by
the
others
as
they
crossed
we
did
not
trust
to
this
rope
alone
but
were
also
tied
in
the
usual
manner
the
second
rope
was
employed
as
an
additional
security
against
slips
there
is
therefore
little
hope
of
thus
arriving
at
anything
decisive
as
to
the
exact
part
which
echoes
take
in
the
production
of
the
rolling
sound
of
english
translated
by
sabine
longmans
the
same
has
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
case
at
all
times
when
i
have
been
close
to
the
points
of
explosion
there
has
been
always
a
distinct
interval
between
the
first
explosion
and
the
rolling
sounds
and
secondary
explosions
which
i
have
to
be
merely
echoes
but
it
has
never
been
possible
except
in
the
case
to
them
as
such
others
have
observed
the
same
the
geologist
professor
theobald
of
chur
who
was
in
the
solferino
storm
between
the
tschiertscher
and
urden
alp
in
the
electric
clouds
says
that
the
peals
were
short
like
cannon
shots
but
of
a
clearer
more
cracking
tone
and
that
the
rolling
of
the
thunder
was
only
heard
farther
berlepsch
s
english
glaisher
has
frequently
pointed
out
that
all
sounds
in
balloons
at
some
distance
from
the
earth
are
notable
for
their
brevity
it
is
one
sound
only
is
no
reverberation
no
and
this
is
characteristic
of
all
sounds
in
the
balloon
one
clear
sound
continuing
during
its
own
vibrations
then
gone
in
a
i
learn
from
glaisher
that
the
which
have
been
heard
by
him
during
his
travels
in
the
air
have
been
no
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
the
absence
of
rolling
has
fortified
his
belief
that
the
rolling
sounds
which
accompany
thunder
are
echoes
and
echoes

the
experiences
of

then
on
at

one

several
persons
have
found
themselves
in
this
predicament
for
five
or
six
consecutive
days
i
am
speaking
exclusively
of
the
disturbances
which
occur
in
the

the
rocks
are
sometimes
so
hot
that
they
are
almost
painful
to

are
extremely
deceptive

who

the
whole

they
are

formed

was
born
at
the
village

in
the

on

a

or
two
older
the

is
also
seen
from
the
top
of
the

rising
above
the
col

this
is
the
lowest
elevation
from
which
i
have
seen
the
actual
summit
of
the
ecrins
it
should
be
observed
that
these
mountains
were
included
in
the
territory
recently
ceded
to
france
the
sardinian
map
above
referred
to
was
the
old
official
map
the
french
survey
alluded
to
afterwards
is
the
survey
in
continuation
of
the
great
french
official
map

includes
the
aiguilles
d
arve
whilst
stopping
in
the
hospice
on
the
col
de
lautaret
in
i
was
accosted
by
a
peasant
who
asked
if
i
would
ride
for
a
consideration
in
his
cart
towards
brian√ßon
he
was
inquisitive
as
to
my
knowledge
of
his
district
and
at
last
asked
have
you
been
at
la
sausse
well
then
i
tell
you
saw
there
some
of
the
first
people
in
the
yes
i
said
they
were
primitive
but
he
was
serious
and
went
yes
real
brave
people
and
slapping
his
knee
to
give
emphasis
that
they
are
for
minding
the
cows
after
this
he
became
communicative
you
thought
probably
said
he
when
i
offered
to
take
you
down
that
i
was
some
poor
not
worth
a
but
i
will
tell
you
that
was
my
mountain
mountain
that
you
saw
at
la
sausse
they
were
cows
a
hundred
of
them
why
you
are
passably
rich
i
have
another
mountain
on
the
col
du
galibier
and
another
at
he
although
a
common
peasant
in
outward
appearance
confessed
to
being
worth
four
thousand
pounds
we
had
seen
a
tracing
from
the
unpublished
sheets
of
the
french
government
survey
the
bracketed
paragraphs
in
chaps
vii
viii
and
ix
are
extracted
from
the
journal
of
moore
it
would
be
uninteresting
and
unprofitable
to
enter
into
a
discussion
of
the
confusion
of
these
names
at
greater
length
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
they
were
confounded
in
a
most
perplexing
manner
by
all
the
authorities
we
were
able
to
consult
and
also
by
the
natives
on
the
spot
a
great
part
of
this
morning
s
route
led
over
shales
which
were
loose
and
troublesome
and
were
probably
a
continuation
of
the
beds
of
the
col
du
galibier
and
the
col
de
lautaret
the
ridge
called
la
meije
runs
from
to
and
is
crowned
by
numerous
aiguilles
of
tolerably
equal
elevation
the
two
highest
are
towards
the
eastern
and
western
ends
of
the
ridge
and
are
rather
more
than
a
mile
apart
to
the
former
the
french
surveyors
assign
a
height
of
and
to
the
latter
feet
in
our
opinion
the
western
aiguille
can
hardly
be
more
than
feet
higher
than
the
eastern
one
it
is
possible
that
its
height
may
have
diminished
since
it
was
measured
in
i
carefully
examined
the
eastern
end
of
the
ridge
from
the
top
of
the
col
de
lautaret
and
saw
that
the
summit
at
that
end
can
be
ascended
by
following
a
long
glacier
which
descends
from
it
towards
the
into
the
valley
of
arsine
the
highest
summit
presents
considerable
difficulties
sheet
of
the
french
map
is
extremely
inaccurate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
meije
and
particularly
so
on
its
northern
side
the
ridges
and
glaciers
which
are
laid
down
upon
it
can
scarcely
be
identified
on
the
spot
the
justness
of
the
observation
will
be
felt
by
those
who
knew
la
grave
in
or
before
at
that
time
the
horses
of
the
couriers
who
were
passing
from
grenoble
to
brian√ßon
and
were
lodged
immediately
underneath
the
and
bedrooms
and
a
pungent
steamy
odour
rose
from
them
through
the
cracks
in
the
floor
and
constantly
pervaded
the
whole
house
i
am
told
that
the
inn
has
been
considerably
improved
since
our
route
from
la
grave
to
la
b√©rarde
will
be
seen
on
the
accompanying
map
taking
one
kind
of
work
with
another
a
thousand
feet
of
height
per
hour
is
about
as
much
as
is
usually
accomplished
on
great
alpine
ascents
fig
represents
in
a
similar
manner
the
distance
and
elevation
of
the
matterhorn
from
and
above
zermatt
see
the
drawing
was
inadvertently
made
the
right
way
on
the
wood
and
the
view
is
now
in
consequence
this
wall
may
be
described
as
an
exaggerated
gemmi
as
seen
from
leukerbad
from
the
highest
summit
of
la
meije
right
down
to
the
glacier

etan√ßons
a
depth
of
about
feet
the
cliff
is
all
but
perpendicular
and
appears
to
be
completely
unassailable
it
is
the
most
imposing
thing
of
its
kind
that
i
have
seen
since
this
chapter
was
first
printed
the
whole
of
the
aiguilles
d
arve
have
been
ascended
and
also
the
highest
point
of
the
meije
for
information
upon
these
ascents
the
reader
is
referred
to
the
pages
of
the

there
are
more
than
twenty
peaks
exceeding

the
most
striking
example
which
has
come
under
my
notice
is
referred
to
in
chapter
xix
see
vol
of
we
considered
the
height
assigned
to
the
final
peak
by
bonney
was
too
small

thought
it
should
have
been

been

made
by
a
french
gentleman
named
vincent
with
the

carrier

followed
our
route
but
reversed
it

is
to

ascended

the
western

descended
by

the
best
course
to
adopt
in
future
attacks
on
the
mountain
would
be
to
bring
a
ladder
or
some
other
means
of
passing
the
bergschrund
in
its
centre
immediately
under
the
summit
one
could
then
proceed
directly
upwards

so
avoid
the

the

the

bordered
by

closed

this
like
many
other
names

that

see
map
on
it
is
perhaps
just
possible
although
improbable
that
these
little
glaciers
were
united
together
at
the
time
that
the
survey
was
made
since
then
the
glaciers
of
dauphin√©
as
throughout
the
alps
generally
have
shrunk
very
considerably
a
notable
diminution
took
place
in
their
size
in
which
was
attributed
by
the
natives
to
the
very
heavy
rains
of
that
year

from

that
the

was
a
local
one
peculiar
to
chamounix
an
example
is
referred

on
much
more
remarkable
cases
might
be

it
is
not
usual
to
find

which
at

have

of
the
most
expert
amateur
mountaineers
of
the
time
and
a
few
of
the
guides
who
have
been
or
will
be
mentioned
in
the
course
of
the
book

late

i
parted
from
him
in
but
upon
writing
to
him
in
the
month
of
april
to
fix
the
dates
of
his
engagement
i
found
that
he
had
supposed
he
was
free
in
consequence
of
not
having
heard
from
me
earlier
and
had
engaged
himself
to
a
from
the
of
june
i
endeavoured
to
hold
him
to
his
promise
but
he
considered
himself
unable
to
withdraw
from
his
later
obligation
his
letters
were
honourable
to
him
the
following
extract
from
the
last
one
he
wrote
to
me
is
given
as
an
interesting
souvenir
of
a
brave
and
upright
man
illustration
facsimile
of
a
letter
from
croz
it
was
an
entry
describing
an
ascent
of
the
grand
cornier
which
we
supposed
had
never
been
ascended
from
the
very
direction
which
we
had
just
pronounced
to
be
hopeless
it
was
especially
startling
because
franz
biener
was
spoken
of
in
the
account
as
having
been
concerned
in
the
ascent
on
examining
biener
it
was
found
that
he
had
made
the
excursion
and
had
supposed
at
the
time
he
was
upon
his
summit
that
it
was
the
grand
cornier
he
saw
afterwards
that
they
had
only
ascended
one
of
the
several
points
upon
the
ridge
running
northwards
from
the
grand
believe

pigne
de
l
all√©e
feet
for
route
see
the
map
of
the
valley
of
zermatt
i
wrote
in
the
august
to
the
same
effect
this
action
of
the
frost
does
not
cease
in
winter
inasmuch
as
it
is
impossible
for
the
matterhorn
to
be
entirely
covered
by
snow
less
precipitous
mountains
may
be
entirely
covered
up
during
winter
and
if
they
do
not
then
actually
gain
height
the
wear
and
tear
is
at
least
suspended
we
arrive
therefore
at
the
conclusion
that
although
such
as
mont
blanc
in
the
course
of
ages
grow
higher
the
matterhorn
must
decrease
in
these
remarks
have
received
confirmation
the
men
who
were
left
by
in
his
observatory
upon
the
summit
of
the
col
th√©odule
during
the
winter
of
remarked
that
the
snow
was
partially
melted
upon
the
rocks
in
their
vicinity
upon
december
of
that
year
and
upon
the
of
december
they
entered
in
their
journal

see
tonson
s
ed
of

may
have
had
this
passage
in
mind
when
he
wrote
it
must
not
be
thought
that
heat
generates
motion
or
motion
heat
though
in
some
respects
this
be
true
but
that
the
very
essence
of
heat
or
the
substantial
self
of
heat
is
motion
and
nothing

the
range
of
temperature
is
greater
but
there
is
evidence
that
the
winter
cold
does
not
penetrate
to
the
innermost
recesses
of
in
the
fact
that
streams
continue
to
flow
underneath

a

perhaps
one

several
ascents
besides
those
made
by

the

have
been
made
in
late
years
but
as
yet
no
one
seems
to
have
discovered
an
easy
route
up
the
mountain
the
ascent
of
the
dent
blanche
is
the
hardest
that
i
have
made
there
was
nothing
upon
it
so
difficult
as
the
last
feet
of
the
pointe
des

but
on
the
other
hand
there
was
hardly
a
step
upon
it
which
was
positively
easy
the
whole
of
the
face
required
actual
climbing
there
was
probably
very
little
difference
in
difficulty
between
the
route
we
took
in
and
that
followed
by
kennedy

of

route
taken
upon

see

iii
pp
subsequent
experiences
of
others
have
strengthened
this
opinion
i
prefer
to
be
on
the
safe
side
my
impression
is
that
snow
can
not
accumulate
in
large
masses
upon
this
subject
i
beg
to
refer
the
reader
to
the
valuable
note
furnished
by
signor
giordano
in
the
appendix
see
pp
and
weathered
granite
is
an
admirable
rock
to
climb
its
gritty
texture
giving
excellent
hold
to
the
nails
in
one
s
boots
but
upon
such
metamorphic
schists
as
compose
the
mass
of
the
great
peak
of
the
matterhorn
the
texture
of
the
rock
itself
is
of
little
or
no
value
i
refer
here
only
to
that
portion
of
the
ridge
which
is
between

made
to
obtain

upon

account
the

selected
in
preference
to

are

upon

it

to
learn
the
way
as
far
as
my
observation
extends
such
things
are
seldom
done
by
or
spiritless
guides
and
i
have
much
pleasure
in
being
able
to
mention
their
names
the
highest
point
was
ascended
on
june
by
horace
walker
with
the
guides
melchior

jaun
and

the
view
of

from
a
gorge
on
the
south
of
the
italian
val
ferret
between
the
villages
of
la
vachey
and
praz
sec
and
about
feet
above
them
is
in
my
opinion
the
finest
which
can
be
obtained
of
that
mountain
range
anywhere
upon
the
italian
side
the
next
generation
may
witness
its
extinction
the
portion
of
it
seen
from
the
village
of
argenti√®re
was
in
at
least
one
quarter
less
in
width
than
it
was
ten
years
earlier
this
observation
is
not
made
without
reason
i
have
seen
the
head
of
one
tumble
off
at
a
slight
tap
in
consequence
of
its
handle
having
been
perforated
by
an
ingenious
but
useless
arrangement
of
nails
i
estimate
its
height
at
feet
the
triangulation
of
capt
mieulet
places
the
summit
of
the
pass
feet
above
the
sea
this
i
think
is
rather
too
high
wanderings
among
the

of

principal
exploits
are
recorded

i
heard
lately
of
two
mountaineers
who
under

of

alarm

am
happy
to
say
that
they
were
able
to

specimens
of
the
highest
rocks
of
the
aiguille

can
not
be
distinguished
from
granite
the
rock
is
almost
identical
in
quality
with
that
at
the
summit
of
mont
dolent
and
is
probably
a
granit√∂id
gneiss
the
summit
of
the
aiguille
verte
was
a
snowy
dome
large
enough
for
a
quadrille
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
great
height
of
les
droites
captain
mieulet
places
its
summit
at
feet
but
i
think
it
must
be
very
slightly
lower
than
the

itself
the

price
for
the
ascent
of
the
aiguille
is
now
placed
at
it
should
be
said
that
we
received
the
most
polite
apologies
for
this
affair
from
the
chief
of
the
gensdarmes
and
an
invitation
to
lodge
a
complaint
against
the

accepted
his
apologies
and
declined
his
invitation
needless
to
add
michel
croz
took
no
part
in
the
demonstration
below

second
the
glacier
is
completely
covered
up
with
moraine
matter
and
if
the
bank
is
followed
one
is
compelled
either
to
traverse
this
howling
waste
or
to
lose
much
time
upon
the
tedious
and
somewhat
difficult
rocks
of
mont
rouge
in
glissading
an
erect
position
should
be
maintained
and
the
point
of
the
alpenstock
allowed
to
trail
over
the
snow
if
it
is
necessary
to
stop
or
to
slacken

comparison
of

what
a
great
difference
in
ease
there
may
be
between
tracks
which
are
nearly
identical
for
a
distance
of
several
miles
these
routes
are
scarcely
more
than
apart
nearly
every
step
of
the
former
is
difficult
whilst
the
latter
has
no
difficulty
whatever
the
route
we
adopted
over
the
col

may
perhaps
be
improved
it
may
be
possible
to
go

surrounds

descends

sold

when
the

suspects
crevasses
and
for
them
in
the
manner
shown
in

usually
loses
half
a
step
or
more
the
second
man
should
take
a
turn
of
the
rope
around
his
hand
to
draw
it
back
in
case
the
leader
goes
through
when
several
persons
are
descending
such
places
it
is
evident
that
the
can
not
derive
any
assistance
from
the
rope
and
so
might
as
well
be
untied
partly
upon
this
account
it
is
usual
to
place
one
of
the
strongest
and
steadiest
men
last
now
although
this
can
not
be
termed
a
senseless
precaution
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
a
perfectly
useless
one
if
it
is
true
that
a
single
slip
would
upset
the
entire
party
the
best
plan
i
know
is
that
which
we
adopted
on
the
descent
of
the
col
dolent
namely
to
let
one
man
go
in
advance
until
he
reaches
some
secure
point
this
one
then
detaches
himself
the
rope
is
drawn
up
and
another
man
is
sent
down
to
join
him
and
so
on
until
the
last
the
last
man
still
occupies
the
most
difficult
post
and
should
be
the
steadiest
man
but
he
is
not
exposed
to
any
risk
from
his
comrades
slipping
and
they
of
course
draw
in
the
rope
as
he
descends
so
that
his
position
is
less
hazardous
than
if
he
were
to
come
down
quite
by
himself
if
you
are
out
upon
an
excursion
and
find
the
work
becoming
so
arduous
that
you
have
great
difficulty
in
maintaining
your
balance
you
should
at
once
retire
and
not
imperil
the
lives
of
others
i
am
well
aware
that
the
withdrawal
of
one
person
for
such
reasons
would
usually
necessitate
the
retreat
of
a
second
and
that
expeditions
would
be
often
cut
short
if
this
were
to
happen
with
the
fear
of
this
before
their
eyes
i
believe
that
many
amateurs
continue
to
go
on
albeit
well
convinced
that
they
ought
not
they
do
not
wish
to
stop
the
sport
of
their
comrades
but
they
frequently
suffer
mental
tortures
in
consequence
which
most
emphatically
do
not
assist
their
stability
and
are
likely
to
lead
to
something
even
more
disagreeable
than
the
abandonment
of
the
excursion
the
moral
is
take
an
adequate
number
of
guides
during
the
preceding
eighteen
days
i
exclude
sundays
and
other
days
we
ascended
more
than
feet
and
descended

congregate

and
carried

amply
sufficient
for
three
days
in

ascent
should
prove
more
troublesome
than
we
anticipated
i
remember
speaking
about
pedestrianism
to
a
mountaineer
some
years
ago
and
venturing
to
remark
that
a
man
who
averaged
thirty
miles
might
be
considered
a
good
walker

walker

said

consider
walking
well
he
replied
i
will
tell
you
some
time
back
a
friend
and
i
agreed
to
go
to
switzerland
but
a
short
time
afterwards
he
wrote
to
say
he
ought
to
let
me
know
that
a
young
and
delicate
lad
was
going
with
him
who
would
not
be
equal
to
great
things
in
fact
he
would
not
be
able
to
do
more
than
fifty
miles
what
became
of
the
young
and
delicate
lad
he
and
who
was
your
extraordinary
friend
charles
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
gentlemen
referred
to
equal
to
walking
more
than
fifty
miles
but
they
were
exceptional
not
pedestrians
charles
hudson
vicar
of
skillington
in
lincolnshire
was
considered
by
the
mountaineering
fraternity
to
be
the
best
amateur
of
his
time
he
was
the
organiser
and
leader
of
the
party
of
englishmen
who
ascended
mont
blanc
by
the
aig
du
go√ªter
and
descended
by
the
grands
mulets
route
without
guides
in
his
long
practice
made
him
surefooted
and
in
that
respect
he
was
not
greatly
inferior
to
a
born
mountaineer
i
remember
him
as
a
man
of
middle
height
and
age
neither
stout
nor
thin
with
face
grave
and
with
quiet
unassuming
manners
although
an
athletic
man
he
would
have
been
overlooked
in
a
crowd
and
although
he
had
done
the
greatest
mountaineering
feats
which
have
been
done
he
was
the
last
man
to
speak
of
his
own
doings
his
friend
hadow
was
a
young
man
of
nineteen
who
had
the
looks
and
manners
of
a
greater
age
he
was
a
rapid
walker
but
was
his
first
season
in
the
alps
lord
francis
douglas
was
about
the
same
age
as
hadow
he
had
had
the
advantage
of
several
seasons
in
the
alps
he
was
nimble
as
a
deer
and
was
becoming
an
expert
mountaineer
just
before
our
meeting
he
had
ascended
the
ober
gabelhorn
with
old
peter
taugwalder
and
jos
viennin
and
this
gave
me
a
high
opinion
of
his
powers
for
i
had
examined
that
mountain
all
round
a
few
weeks
before
and
had
declined
its
ascent
on
account
of
its
apparent
difficulty
my
personal
acquaintance
with
hudson
was
very
i
should
have
been
content
to
have
placed
myself
under
his
orders
if
he
had
chosen
to
claim
the
position
to
which
he
was
entitled
those
who
knew
him
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
so
far
from
doing
this
he
lost
no
opportunity
of
consulting
the
wishes
and
opinions
of
those
around
him
we
deliberated
together
whenever
there
was
occasion
and
our
authority
was
recognised
by
the
others
whatever
responsibility
there
was
devolved
upon
i
recollect
with
satisfaction
that
there
was
no
difference
of
opinion
between
us
as
to
what
should
be
done
and
that
the
most
perfect
harmony
existed
between
all
of
us
so
long
as
we
were
together
arrived
at
the
chapel
left
it
halted
to
examine
route
started
again
and
arrived
at
at
the
cairn
made
by
kennedy
in
see
marked
feet
upon
the
map
stopped
min
here
from
the
h√∂rnli
to
this
point
we
kept
when
possible
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
greater
part
of
the
way
was
excessively
easy
though
there
were
a
few
places
where
the
axe
had
to
be
used
thus
far
the
guides
did
not
once
go
to
the
front
hudson
or
i
led
and
when
any
cutting
was
required
we
did
it
ourselves
this
was
done
to
spare
the
guides
and
to
show
them
that
we
were
thoroughly
in
earnest
the
spot
at
which
we
camped
was
four
hours
walking
from
zermatt
and
is
marked
upon
the
it
was
just
upon
a
level
with
the
furggengrat
and
its
position
is
indicated
upon
the
engraving
facing
by
a
little
circular
white
spot
in
a
line
with
the
word
camp
it
was
originally
intended
to
leave
both
of
the
young
men
behind
we
found
it
difficult
to
divide
the
food
and
so
the
new
arrangement
was
made
see
pp
for
track
see
the
lower
of
the
outlines
facing
see
remarks
on
ar√™tes
and
faces
on
there
is
very
little
to
choose
between
in
the
ar√™tes
leading
from
the
summit
towards
the
h√∂rnli
ridge
and
towards
the
col
du
lion
ridge
both
are
jagged
serrated
ridges
which
any
experienced
climber
would
willingly
avoid
if
he
could
find
another
route
on
the
northern
zermatt
side
the
eastern
face
affords
another
route
or
any
number
of
routes
since
there
is
hardly
a
part
of
it
which
can
not
be
traversed
on
the
southern
breil
side
the
ridge
alone
generally
speaking
can
be
followed
and
when
it
becomes
impracticable
and
the
climber
is
forced
to
bear
down
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
the
work
is
of
the
most
difficult
character
very
few
stones
fell
during
the
two
days
i
was
on
the
mountain
and
none
came
near
us
others
who
have
followed
the
same
route
have
not
been
so
fortunate
they
may
not
perhaps
have
taken
the
same
precautions
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
the
lateral
moraine
of
the
left
bank
of
the
furggengletscher
is
scarcely
larger
than
that
of
the
right
bank
although
the
former
receives
all
the
d√©bris
that
falls
from
the
feet
of
cliffs
which
form
the
eastern
side
of
the
matterhorn
whilst
the
latter
is
fed
by
perfectly
insignificant
slopes
neither
of
these
moraines
is
large
this
is
strong
evidence
that
stones
do
fall
to
any
great
extent
from
the
eastern
face
the
inward
dip
of
the
beds
retains
the
detritus
in
place
hence
the
eastern
face
appears
when
one
is
upon
it
to
be
undergoing
more
rapid
disintegration
than
the
other
sides
in
reality
the
mantle
of
ruin
spares
the
mountain
from
farther
waste
upon
the
southern
side
rocks
fall
as
they
are
rent
off
each
day
s
work
is
cleared
away
every
day
and
hence
the
faces
and
ridges
are
left
naked
and
are
exposed
to
fresh
attacks
the
snow
seen
in
the
engraving
facing
below
the
summit
and
a
little
to
its
right
this
part
was
less
steeply
inclined
than
the
whole
of
the
eastern
face
i
have
no
memorandum
of
the
time
that
it
occupied
it
must
have
taken
about
an
hour
and
a
half
the
highest
points
are
towards
the
two
ends
in
the
northern
end
was
slightly
higher
than
the
southern
one
in
bygone
years
carrel
and
i
often
suggested
to
each
other
that
we
might
one
day
arrive
upon
the
top
and
find
ourselves
cut
off
from
the
very
highest
point
by
a
notch
in
the
which
is
seen
from
the
theodule
and
from
breil
marked
on
the
outline
on
this
notch
is
very
conspicuous
from
below
but
when
we
were
upon
the
summit
it
was
hardly
noticed
and
it
could
be
passed
without
the
least
difficulty
i
have
learnt
since
from
carrel
that
they
heard
our
first
cries
they
were
then
upon
the
ridge
close
to
the
cravate
and
hundred
and
feet
below
us
or
as
the
crow
flies
at
a
distance
of
about
of
a
mile
at
our
departure
the
men
were
confident
that
the
ascent
would
be
made
and
took
one
of
the
poles
out
of
the
tent
i
protested
that
it
was
tempting
providence
they
took
the
pole
nevertheless
signor
giordano
was
naturally
disappointed
at
the
result
and
wished
the
men
to
start
again
all
refused
to
do
so
with
the
exception
of
upon
the
of
july
he
set
out
again
with
three
others
and
upon
the
gained
the
summit
by
passing
at
first
up
the
ridge
and
afterwards
by
turning
over
to
the
z
mutt
or
side
on
the
he
returned
to
breil
whilst
we
were
upon
the
southern
end
of
the
we
paid
some
attention
to
the
portion
of
the
mountain
which
intervened
between
ourselves
and
the
italian
guides
it
seemed
as
if
there
would
not
be
the
least
chance
for
them
if
they
should
attempt
to
storm
the
final
peak
directly
from
the
end
of
the
in
that
direction
cliffs
fell
sheer
down
from
the
summit
and
we
were
unable
to
see
beyond
a
certain
distance
there
remained
the
route
about
which
carrel
and
i
had
often
talked
namely
to
ascend
directly
at
first
from
the
end
of
the
shoulder
and
afterwards
to
swerve
to
the
is
to
the
z
mutt
to
complete
the
ascent
from
the
when
we
were
upon
the
summit
we
laughed
at
this
idea
the
part
of
the
mountain
that
i
have
described
upon
was
not
easy
although
its
inclination
was
moderate
if
that
slope
were
made
only
ten
degrees
steeper
its
difficulty
would
be
enormously
increased
to
double
its
inclination
would
be
to
make
it
impracticable
the
slope
at
the
southern
end
of
the
falling
towards
the
was
steeper
than
that
over
which
we
passed
and
we
ridiculed
the
idea
that
any
person
should
attempt
to
ascend
in
that
direction
when
the
northern
route
was
so
easy
nevertheless
the
summit
was
reached
by
that
route
by
the
undaunted
carrel
from
knowing
the
final
slope
over
which
he
passed
and
from
the
account
of
is
the
only
traveller
by
whom
it
has
been
do
not
hesitate
to
term
the
ascent
of
carrel
and
bich
in
the
most
desperate
piece
of
upon
record
in
i
asked
carrel
if
he
had
ever
done
anything
more
difficult
his
reply
was
man
can
not
do
anything
much
more
difficult
than
that
see
appendix
the
was
much
shattered
although
not
so
extensively
as
the
and
ridges
the
highest
rock
in
was
a
block
of
micaschist
and
the
fragment
i
broke
off
it
not
only
possesses
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
character
of
the
peak
but
mimics
in
an
astonishing
manner
the
details
of
its
form
see
illustration
on
page
it
is
most
unusual
to
see
the
southern
half
of
the
panorama
unclouded
a
hundred
ascents
may
be
made
before
this
will
be
the
case
again
the
substance
of
chapter
xx
appeared
in
a
letter
in
the
august
a
few
paragraphs
have
now
been
added
and
a
few
corrections
have
been
made
the
former
will
help
to
make
clear
that
which
was
obscure
in
the
original
account
and
the
latter
are
mostly
unimportant
if
the
members
of
the
party
had
been
more
equally
efficient
croz
would
have
been
placed
described
upon
pp
not
at
all
an
unusual
proceeding
even
between
born
mountaineers
i
wish
to
convey
the
impression
that
croz
was
using
all
pains
rather
than
to
indicate
extreme
inability
on
the
part
of
hadow
the
insertion
of
the
word
absolutely
makes
the
passage
perhaps
rather
ambiguous
i
retain
it
now
in
order
to
offer
the
above
explanation
at
the
moment
of
the
accident
croz
hadow
and
hudson
were
all
close
together
between
hudson
and
lord
douglas
the
rope
was
all
but
taut
and
the
same
between
all
the
others
who
were
croz
was
standing
by
the
side
of
a
rock
which
afforded
good
hold
and
if
he
had
been
aware
or
had
suspected
that
anything
was
about
to
occur
he
might
and
would
have
gripped
it
and
would
have
prevented
any
mischief
he
was
taken
totally
by
surprise
hadow
slipped
off
his
feet
on
to
his
back
his
feet
struck
croz
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
knocked
him
right
over
head
first
croz
s
axe
was
out
of
his
reach
yet
without
it
he
managed
to
get
his
head
uppermost
before
he
disappeared
from
our
sight
if
it
had
been
in
his
hand
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
have
stopped
himself
and
hadow
hadow
at
the
moment
of
his
slip
was
not
occupying
a
bad
position
he
could
have
moved
either
up
or
down
and
could
touch
with
his
hand
the
rock
of
which
i
have
spoken
hudson
was
not
so
well
placed
but
he
had
liberty
of
motion
the
rope
was
not
taut
from
him
to
hadow
and
the
two
men
fell
ten
or
twelve
feet
before
the
jerk
came
upon
him
lord
douglas
was
not
favourably
placed
and
could
neither
move
up
nor
down
old
peter
was
firmly
planted
and
stood
just
beneath
a
large
rock
which
he
hugged
with
both
arms
i
enter
into
these
details
to
make
it
more
apparent
that
the
position
occupied
by
the
party
at
the
moment
of
the
accident
was
not
by
any
means
excessively
trying
we
were
compelled
to
pass
over
the
exact
spot
where
the
slip
occurred
and
we
with
shaken
was
not
a
difficult
place
to
pass
i
have
described
the
as
difficult
and
it
is
so
undoubtedly
to
most
persons
but
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
hadow
slipped
at
an
easy
part
or
more
correctly
we
held
on
as
tightly
as
possible
there
was
no
time
to
change
our
position
these
ends
i
believe
are
still
attached
to
the
rocks
and
mark
our
line
of
ascent
and
descent
i
saw
one
of
them
in
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
this
remarkable
phenomenon
and
was
glad
when
it
disappeared
as
it
distracted
our
attention
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
should
have
felt
vexed
afterwards
at
not
having
observed
with
greater
precision
an
occurrence
so
rare
and
so
wonderful
i
can
add
very
little
about
it
to
that
which
is
said
above
the
sun
was
directly
at
our
backs
that
is
to
say
the
was
opposite
to
the
sun
the
time
was
the
forms
were
at
once
tender
and
sharp
neutral
in
tone
were
developed
gradually
and
disappeared
suddenly
the
mists
were
light
that
is
not
dense
and
were
dissipated
in
the
course
of
the
evening
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
crosses
are
incorrectly
figured
in
the
accompanying
view
and
that
they
were
probably
formed
by
the
intersection
of
other
circles
or
ellipses
as
shown
in
the
annexed
diagram
i
think
this
suggestion
is
very
likely
correct
but
i
have
preferred
to
follow
my
original
memorandum
illustration
diagram
of
in
parry
s
of
an
attempt
to
reach
the
north
there
is
at
pp
an
account
of
the
occurrence
of
a
phenomenon
analogous
to
the
one
at
five
we
witnessed
a
very
beautiful
natural
phenomenon
a
broad
white
first
appeared
opposite
to
the
sun
as
was
very
commonly
the
case
etc
i
follow
parry
in
using
the
term
it
may
be
observed
that
upon
the
descent
of
the
italian
guides
whose
expedition
is
noticed
upon
and
again
in
the
appendix
upon
july
the
phenomenon
commonly
termed
the

was
observed

this
occurred
at
about

the
italians
in

were
at
about
the
same
height
as
feet
they
had
been
travelling
with
and
had
been
engaged
by
lord
douglas
and
so
considered
him
their
employer
and
responsible
to
them
transcribed
from
the
original
memorandum
nor
did
i
speak
to
them
afterwards
unless
it
was
absolutely
necessary
so
long
as
we
were
together
a
portrait
of

is
given
in

a

a

were
found
this
somehow
became
publicly
known
and
gave
rise
to
wild
notions
which
would
not
have
been
entertained
had
it
been
also
known
that

that
he
does
not
feel
that
the
suppression
of
the
truth
is
equally
against
the
interests
of
travellers
and
of
the
guides
if
the
men
are
untrustworthy
the
public
should
be
warned
of
the
fact
but
if
they
are
blameless
why
allow
them
to
remain
under
unmerited
suspicion
old
peter
taugwalder
is
a
man
who
is
labouring
under
an
unjust
accusation
notwithstanding
repeated
denials
even
his
comrades
and
neighbours
at
zermatt
persist
in
asserting
or
insinuating
that
he
the
rope
which
led
from
him
to
lord
douglas
in
regard
to
this
infamous
charge
i
say
that
he
not
do
so
at
the
moment
of
the
slip
and
that
the
end
of
the
rope
in
my
possession
shows
that
he
did
not
do
so
beforehand
there
remains
however
the
suspicious
fact
that
the
rope
which
broke
was
the
thinnest
and
weakest
one
that
we
had
it
is
suspicious
because
it
is
unlikely
that
any
of
the
four
men
in
front
would
have
selected
an
old
and
weak
rope
when
there
was
abundance
of
new
and
much
stronger
rope
to
spare
and
on
the
other
hand
because
if
taugwalder
thought
that
an
accident
was
likely
to
happen
it
was
to
his
interest
to
have
the
weaker
rope
where
it
was
placed
i
should
rejoice
to
learn
that
his
answers
to
the
questions
which
were
put
to
him
were
satisfactory
not
only
was
his
act
at
the
critical
moment
wonderful
as
a
feat
of
strength
but
it
was
admirable
in
its
performance
at
the
right
time
i
am
told
that
he
is
now
nearly
incapable
for
absolutely
mad
but
with
intellect
gone
and
almost
crazy
which
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
whether
we
regard
him
as
a
man
who
contemplated
a
scoundrelly
meanness
or
as
an
injured
man
suffering
under
an
unjust
accusation
in
respect
to
young
peter
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
in
the
same
manner
the
odious
idea
that
he
propounded
which
i
believe
emanated
from
he
has
endeavoured
to
trade
upon
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
his
father
was
paid
for
both
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
whatever
may
be
his
abilities
as
a
guide
he
is
not
one
to
whom
i
would
ever
trust
my
life
or
afford
any
countenance
they
followed
the
route
laid
down
upon
the
map
and
on
their
descent
were
in
great
peril
from
the
fall
of
a
the
character
of
the
work
they
undertook
may
be
gathered
from
a
reference
to
this

a
subsequent
party

and
so

were
applied
by
carrel
and
myself
to
the
various
points
in
consequence
of
real
or
supposed
resemblances
in
the
rocks
to
other
things
a
few
of
the
terms
originated
with
the
author
but
they
are
chiefly
due
to
the
inventive
genius
of
carrel
this
point
is
marked
by
the
red
letter
upon
the
lower
of
the
two
outlines
facing

have
seen
icicles
more
than
a
hundred
feet
long
hanging
from

rocks

it
should
be
observed
that
ropes
had
been
fixed
by
carrel
and
others
over
the
difficult
parts
of
the
mountain
as
high
as
the

the
advent
of
these
persons
this
explains
the
facility
with
which
they
moved
over
ground
which
had
been
found
very
trying

earlier
times
the

woman
declared
that
the
ascent
as
far
as
she
went
was
a
trifle
