for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
by
marcus
clarke
dedication
to
sir
charles
gavan
duffy
my
dear
sir
charles
i
take
leave
to
dedicate
this
work
to
you
not
merely
because
your
nineteen
years
of
political
and
literary
life
in
australia
render
it
very
fitting
that
any
work
written
by
a
resident
in
the
colonies
and
having
to
do
with
the
history
of
past
colonial
days
should
bear
your
name
upon
its
dedicatory
page
but
because
the
publication
of
my
book
is
due
to
your
advice
and
encouragement
the
convict
of
fiction
has
been
hitherto
shown
only
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
end
of
his
career
either
his
exile
has
been
the
mysterious
end
to
his
misdeeds
or
he
has
appeared
upon
the
scene
to
claim
interest
by
reason
of
an
equally
unintelligible
love
of
crime
acquired
during
his
experience
in
a
penal
settlement
charles
reade
has
drawn
the
interior
of
a
house
of
correction
in
england
and
victor
hugo
has
shown
how
a
french
convict
fares
after
the
fulfilment
of
his
sentence
but
no
writer
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
attempted
to
depict
the
dismal
condition
of
a
felon
during
his
term
of
transportation
i
have
endeavoured
in
his
natural
life
to
set
forth
the
working
and
the
results
of
an
english
system
of
transportation
carefully
considered
and
carried
out
under
official
supervision
and
to
illustrate
in
the
manner
best
calculated
as
i
think
to
attract
general
attention
the
inexpediency
of
again
allowing
offenders
against
the
law
to
be
herded
together
in
places
remote
from
the
wholesome
influence
of
public
opinion
and
to
be
submitted
to
a
discipline
which
must
necessarily
depend
for
its
just
administration
upon
the
personal
character
and
temper
of
their
gaolers
your
critical
faculty
will
doubtless
find
in
the
construction
and
artistic
working
of
this
book
many
faults
i
do
not
think
however
that
you
will
discover
any
exaggerations
some
of
the
events
narrated
are
doubtless
tragic
and
terrible
but
i
hold
it
needful
to
my
purpose
to
record
them
for
they
are
events
which
have
actually
occurred
and
which
if
the
blunders
which
produced
them
be
repeated
must
infallibly
occur
again
it
is
true
that
the
british
government
have
ceased
to
deport
the
criminals
of
england
but
the
method
of
punishment
of
which
that
deportation
was
a
part
is
still
in
existence
port
blair
is
a
port
arthur
filled
with
instead
of
englishmen
and
within
the
last
year
france
has
established
at
new
caledonia
a
penal
settlement
which
will
in
the
natural
course
of
things
repeat
in
its
annals
the
history
of
macquarie
harbour
and
of
norfolk
island
with
this
brief
preface
i
beg
you
to
accept
this
work
i
would
that
its
merits
were
equal
either
to
your
kindness
or
to
my
regard
i

his
natural
life
prologue
on
the
evening
of
may
the
garden
of
a
large
mansion
called
north
end
house
which
enclosed
in
spacious
grounds
stands
on
the
eastern
height
of
hampstead
heath
between
finchley
road
and
the
chestnut
avenue
was
the
scene
of
a
domestic
tragedy
three
persons
were
the
actors
in
it
one
was
an
old
man
whose
white
hair
and
wrinkled
face
gave
token
that
he
was
at
least
sixty
years
of
age
he
stood
erect
with
his
back
to
the
wall
which
separates
the
garden
from
the
heath
in
the
attitude
of
one
surprised
into
sudden
passion
and
held
uplifted
the
heavy
ebony
cane
upon
which
he
was
ordinarily
accustomed
to
lean
he
was
confronted
by
a
man
of
unusually
tall
and
athletic
of
figure
dresses
in
rough
seafaring
clothes
and
who
held
in
his
arms
protecting
her
a
lady
of
middle
age
the
face
of
the
young
man
wore
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
the
slight
frame
of
the
woman
was
convulsed
with
sobs
these
three
people
were
sir
richard
devine
his
wife
and
his
only
son
richard
who
had
returned
from
abroad
that
morning
so
madam
said
sir
richard
in
the
accents
which
in
crises
of
great
mental
agony
are
common
to
the
most
of
us
you
have
been
for
twenty
years
a
living
lie
for
twenty
years
you
have
cheated
and
mocked
me
for
twenty
years
in
company
with
a
scoundrel
whose
name
is
a
byword
for
all
that
is
profligate
and
base
you
have
laughed
at
me
for
a
credulous
and
fool
and
now
because
i
dared
to
raise
my
hand
to
that
reckless
boy
you
confess
your
shame
and
glory
in
the
confession
mother
dear
mother
cried
the
young
man
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
say
that
you
did
not
mean
those
words
you
said
them
but
in
anger
see
i
am
calm
now
and
he
may
strike
me
if
he
lady
devine
shuddered
creeping
close
as
though
to
hide
herself
in
the
broad
bosom
of
her
son
the
old
man
continued
i
married
you
ellinor
wade
for
your
beauty
you
married
me
for
my
fortune
i
was
a
plebeian
a
ship
carpenter
you
were
well

your
father

a
man
of
fashion
a
gambler
the
friend
of
rakes
and
prodigals
i

rich
i
had
been
knighted
i
was
in
favour
at
court
he
wanted
money
and
he
sold
you
i
paid
the
price
he
asked
but
there
was
nothing
of
your
cousin
my
lord
bellasis
and
wotton
in
the
spare

sir

said
lady
ellinor
faintly

spared
me

he
cried
in
sudden
fury
i

not
to

easily
your
family
are
proud
colonel
wade
has
other
daughters
your
lover
my
lord
bellasis

his
broken
fortunes

marriage

confessed

shame

father

sisters

the
world

the
story

have
told
me
by
heaven

burst
out
the
young
man

bastard
cried
sir
richard
ay
bite
your
lips
the
word
is
of
your
precious
mother
making
lady
devine
slipped
through
her
son
arms
and
fell
on
her
knees
at
her
husband
feet
do
not
do
this
richard
i
have
been
faithful
to
you
for
years
i
have
borne
all
the
slights
and
insults
you
have
heaped
upon
me
the
shameful
secret
of
my
early
love
broke
from
me
when
in
your
rage
you
threatened
him
let
me
go
away
kill
me
but
do
not
shame
sir
richard
who
had
turned
to
walk
away
stopped
suddenly
and
his
great
white
eyebrows
came
together
in
his
red
face
with
a
savage
scowl
he
laughed
and
in
that
laugh
his
fury
seemed
to
congeal
into
a
cold
and
cruel
hate
you
would
preserve
your
good
name
then
you
would
conceal
this
disgrace
from
the
world
you
shall
have
your
wish
upon
one
what
is
it
sir
she
asked
rising
but
trembling
with
terror
as
she
stood
with
drooping
arms
and
widely
opened
eyes
the
old
man
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
and
then
said
slowly
that
this
impostor
who
so
long
has
falsely
borne
my
name
has
wrongfully
squandered
my
money
and
unlawfully
eaten
my
bread
shall
pack
that
he
abandon
for
ever
the
name
he
has
usurped
keep
himself
from
my
sight
and
never
set
foot
again
in
house
of
you
would
not
part
me
from
my
only
son
cried
the
wretched
woman
take
him
with
you
to
his
father
richard
devine
gently
loosed
the
arms
that
again
clung
around
his
neck
kissed
the
pale
face
and
turned
his
own
scarcely
less
pale
towards
the
old
man
i
owe
you
no
duty
he
said
you
have
always
hated
and
reviled
me
when
by
your
violence
you
drove
me
from
your
house
you
set
spies
to
watch
me
in
the
life
i
had
chosen
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
you
i
have
long
felt
it
now
when
i
learn
for

first
time
whose
son
i
really
am
i
rejoice
to
think
that

strait
or
poverty

your
life
should
hang
upon
the
issue
the
instant

on

instant

hour

he
passed
them
upright
as
if
upborne
by
passion
strode
down
the
garden
with
the
vigour
that
anger
lends
and
took
the
road
to
london
richard
cried
the
poor
mother

black
hair

calmer
mother
sir
richard
devine
knight
shipbuilder
naval
contractor
and
millionaire
was
the
son
of
a
harwich
boat
carpenter
early
left
an
orphan
with
a
sister
to
support
he
soon
reduced
his
sole
aim
in
life
to
the
accumulation
of
money
in
the
harwich
nearly
fifty
years
before
he
had
contracted
in
defiance
of
prophesied
failure
to
build
the
hastings
sloop
of
war
for
his
majesty
king
george
the
third
lords
of
the
admiralty
this
contract
was
the
thin
end
of
that
wedge
which
eventually
split
the
mighty
oak
block
of
government
patronage
into
and
ships
of
the
line
which
did
good
service
under
pellew
parker
nelson
hood
which
exfoliated
and
ramified
into
huge
dockyards
at
plymouth
portsmouth
and
sheerness
and
bore
as
its
buds
and
flowers
countless
barrels
of
measly
pork
and
maggoty
biscuit
the
sole
aim
of
the
coarse
pushing
and
son
of
dick
devine
was
to
make
money
he
had
cringed
and
crawled
and
fluttered
and
blustered
had
licked
the
dust
off
great
men
shoes
and
danced
attendance
in
great
men
nothing
was
too
low
nothing
too
high
for
him
a
shrewd
man
of
business
a
thorough
master
of
his
trade
troubled
with
no
scruples
of
honour
or
of
delicacy
he
made
money
rapidly
and
saved
it
when
made
the
first
hint
that
the
public
received
of
his
wealth
was
in
when
devine
one
of
the
shipwrights
to
the
government
and
a
comparatively
young
man
of
or
thereabouts
subscribed
five
thousand
pounds
to
the
loyalty
loan
raised
to
prosecute
the
french
war
in
after
doing
good
and
it
was
hinted
not
unprofitable
service
in
the
trial
of
lord
melville
the
treasurer
of
the
navy
he
married
his
sister
to
a
wealthy
bristol
merchant
one
anthony
frere
and
married
himself
to
ellinor
wade
the
eldest
daughter
of
colonel
wotton
wade
a
boon
companion
of
the
regent
and
uncle
by
marriage
of
a
remarkable
scamp
and
dandy
lord
bellasis
at
that
time
what
with
lucky
speculations
in
the
funds
assisted
it
was
whispered
by
secret
intelligence
from
france
during
the
stormy
years
of
and
and
the
legitimate
profit
on
his
government
contracts
he
had
accumulated
a
princely
fortune
and
could
afford
to
live
in
princely
magnificence
but
the
burden
of
parsimony
and
avarice
which
he
had
voluntarily
taken
upon
him
was
not
to
be
shaken
off
and
the
only
show
he
made
of
his
wealth
was
by
purchasing
on
his
knighthood
the
rambling
but
comfortable
house
at
hampstead
and
ostensibly
retiring
from
active
business
his
retirement
was
not
a
happy
one
he
was
a
stern
father
and
a
severe
master
his
servants
hated
and
his
wife
feared
him
his
only
son
richard
appeared
to
inherit
his
father
strong
will
and
imperious
manner
under
careful
supervision
and
a
just
rule
he
might
have
been
guided
to
good
but
left
to
his
own
devices
outside
and
galled
by
the
iron
yoke
of
parental
discipline
at
home
he
became
reckless
and
prodigal
the
mother
poor
timid
ellinor
who
had
been
rudely
torn
from
the
love
of
her
youth
her
cousin
lord
bellasis
tried
to
restrain
him
but
the
boy
though
owning
for
his
mother
that
strong
love
which
is
often
a
part
of
such
violent
natures
proved
intractable
and
after
three
years
of
parental
feud
he
went
off
to
the
continent
to
pursue
there
the
same
reckless
life
which
in
london
had
offended
sir
richard
sir
richard
upon
this
sent
for
maurice
frere
his
son
the
abolition
of
the
slave
trade
had
ruined
the
bristol
house
of
frere
and
bought
for
him
a
commission
in
a
marching
regiment
hinting
darkly
of
special
favours
to
come
his
open
preference
for
his
nephew
had
galled
to
the
quick
his
sensitive
wife

of

the

no

had
he

than
he
took
to

debauchery
with
all
the
extravagance
of

in

a

page
of

young
wade
he
says
is
reported
to
have
lost
one
thousand
guineas
last
night
to
that
vulgarest
of

armigell

became
a

and
at
thirty
years
of
age
having
lost
together
with
his
estates
all
chance
of
winning
the
one
woman
who
might
have
saved
him
his
cousin
ellinor
he
became
that
most
unhappy
of
all
beings
a
blackleg
when
he
was
told
by
cool
colonel
wade
that
the
rich
shipbuilder
sir
richard
devine
had
proposed
an
alliance
with
gentle
ellinor
he
swore
with
fierce
knitting
of
his
black
brows
that
no
law
of
man
nor
heaven
should
further
restrain
him
in
his
selfish
prodigality
you
have
sold
your
daughter
and
ruined
me
he
said
look
to
the
colonel
wade
sneered
at
his
fiery
kinsman
you
will
find
sir
richard
house
a
pleasant
one
to
visit
armigell
and
he
should
be
worth
an
income
to
so
experienced
a
gambler
as
lord
bellasis
did
visit
at
sir
richard
house
during
the
first
year
of
his
cousin
marriage
but
upon
the
birth
of
the
son
who
is
the
hero
of
this
history
he
affected
a
quarrel
with
the
city
knight
and
cursing
him
to
the
prince
and
poins
for
a
miserly
curmudgeon
who
neither
diced
nor
drank
like
a
gentleman
departed
more
desperately
at
war
with
fortune
than
ever
for
his
old
haunts
the
year
found
him
a
hardened
hopeless
old
man
of
sixty
battered
in
health
and
ruined
in
pocket
but
who
by
dint
of
stays
and
courage
yet
faced
the
world
with
undaunted
front
and
dined
as
gaily
in
belsize
as
he
had
dined
at
carlton
house
of
the
possessions
of
the
house
of
wotton
wade
this
old
manor
timberless
and
bare
was
all
that
remained
and
its
master
rarely
visited
it
on
the
evening
of
may
lord
bellasis
had
been
attending
a
pigeon
match
at
hornsey
wood
and
having
resisted
the
importunities
of
his
companion
lionel
crofton
a
young
whose
position
in
the
sporting
world
was
not
the
most
secure
who
wanted
him
to
go
on
into
town
he
had
avowed
his
intention
of
striking
across
hampstead
to
belsize

have
an
appointment
at
the
fir
trees
on
the
heath
he
said
with
a

well
he
is
only
just
ordained
i
met
him
last
year
at
bath
on
his
vacation
from
cambridge
and
he
was
good
enough
to
lose
some
money
to
and
now
waits
to
pay
it
out
of
his
first
curacy
i
wish
your
lordship
joy
with
all
my
soul

we
must
push
on
for

thanks
my
dear
sir

dryly
you

with
me
for
the
sitting
of
last
week
hark
the
clock
is
striking
nine
good
at
nine
richard
devine
quitted
his
mother
house
to
begin
the
new
life
he
had
chosen
and
so
drawn
together
by
that
strange
fate
of
circumstances
which
creates
events
the
father
and
son
approached
each
other
as
the
young
man
gained
the
middle
of
the
path
which
led
to
the
heath
he
met
sir
richard
returning
from
the
village
it
was
no
part
of
his
plan
to
seek
an
interview
with
the
man
whom
his
mother
had
so
deeply
wronged
and
he
would
have
slunk
past
in
the
gloom
but
seeing
him
thus
alone
returning
to
a
desolated
home
the
prodigal
was
tempted
to
utter
some
words
of
farewell
and
of
regret
to
his
astonishment
however
sir
richard
passed
swiftly
on
with
body
bent
forward
as
one
in
the
act
of
falling
and
with
eyes
unconscious
of
surroundings
staring
straight
into
the
distance
at
this
strange
appearance
richard
hurried
onward
and
at
a
turn
of
the
path
stumbled
upon
something
which
horribly
accounted
for
the
curious
action
of
the
old
man
a
dead
body
lay
upon
its
face
in
the
heather
beside
it
was
a
heavy
riding
whip
stained
at
the
handle
with
blood
and
an
open
richard
took
up
the
book
and
read
in
gold
letters
on
the
cover
lord
the
unhappy
young
man
knelt
down
beside
the
body
and
raised
it
the
skull
had
been
fractured
by
a
blow
but
it
seemed
that
life
yet
lingered
overcome
with
horror
for
he
could
not
doubt
but
that
his
mother
worst
fears
had
been
realized
richard
knelt
there
holding
his
murdered
father
in
his
arms
waiting
until
the
murderer
whose
name
he
bore
should
have
placed
himself
beyond
pursuit
it
seemed
an
hour
to
his
excited
fancy
before
he
saw
a
light
pass
along
the
front
of
the
house
he
had
quitted
and
knew
that
sir
richard
had
safely
reached
his
chamber
with
some
bewildered
intention
of
summoning
aid
he
left
the
body
and
made
towards
the
town
as
he
stepped
out
on
the
path
he
heard
voices
and
presently
some
dozen
men
one
of
whom
held
a
horse
burst
out
upon
him
and
with
sudden
fury
seized
and
flung
him
to
the
ground
at
first
the
young
man
so
rudely
assailed
did
not
comprehend
his
own
danger
his
mind
bent
upon
one
hideous
explanation
of
the
crime
did
not
see
another
obvious
one
which
had
already
occurred
to
the
mind
of
the
landlord
of
the
three
spaniards
god
defend
me
cried
mogford
scanning
by
the
pale
light
of
the
rising
moon
the
features
of
the
murdered
man
but
it
is
lord
bellasis
oh
you
bloody
villain
jem
bring
him
along
here
his
lordship
can
recognize
him
it
was
not
i
cried
richard
devine
for
god
sake
my
lord
say
then
he
stopped
abruptly
and
being
forced
on
his
knees
by
his
captors
remained
staring
at
the
dying
man
in
sudden
and
ghastly
fear
those
men
in
whom
emotion
has
the
effect
of
quickening
circulation
of
the
blood
reason
rapidly
in
moments
of
danger
and
in
the
terrible
instant
when
his
eyes
met
those
of
lord
bellasis
richard
devine
had
summed
up
the
chances
of
his
future
fortune
and
realized
to
the
full
his
personal
peril
the
runaway
horse
had
given
the
alarm
the
drinkers
at
the
spaniards
inn
had
started
to
search
the
heath
and
had
discovered
a
fellow
in
rough
costume
whose
person
was
unknown
to
them
hastily
quitting
a
spot
where
beside
a
rifled
and
a
whip
lay
a
dying
man
the
web
of
circumstantial
evidence
had
enmeshed
him
an
hour
ago
escape
would
have
been
easy
he
would
have
had
but
to
cry
i
am
the
son
of
sir
richard
devine
come
with
me
to
yonder
house
and
i
will
prove
to
you
that
i
have
but
just
quitted
it
to
place
his
innocence
beyond
immediate
question
that
course
of
action
was
impossible
now
knowing
sir
richard
as
he
did
and
believing
moreover
that
in
his
raging
passion
the
old
man
had
himself
met
and
murdered
the
destroyer
of
his
honour
the
son
of
lord
bellasis
and
lady
devine
saw
himself
in
a
position
which
would
compel
him
either
to
sacrifice
himself
or
to
purchase
a
chance
of
safety
at
the
price
of
his
mother
dishonour
and
the
death
of
the
man
whom
his
mother
had
deceived
if
the
outcast
son
were
brought
a
prisoner
to
north
end
house
sir
richard
now
doubly
oppressed
of
fate
would
be
certain
to
deny
him
and
he
would
be
compelled
in
to
reveal
a
story
which
would
at
once
bring
his
mother
to
open
infamy
and
send
to
the
gallows
the
man
who
had
been
for
twenty
years
deceived
the
man
to
whose
kindness
he
owed
education
and
former
fortune
he
knelt
stupefied
unable
to
speak
or
move
come
cried
mogford
again
say
my
lord
is
this
the
villain
lord
bellasis
rallied
his
failing
senses
his
glazing
eyes
stared
into
his
son
face
with
horrible
eagerness
he
shook
his
head
raised
a
feeble
arm
as
though
to
point
elsewhere
and
fell
back
dead
if
you
did
murder
him
you
robbed
him
growled
mogford
and
you
shall
sleep
at
bow
street
tom
run
on
to
meet
the
patrol
and
leave
word
at
the
that
i
a
passenger
for
the
coach
bring
him
on
jack
what
your
name
eh
he
repeated
the
rough
question
twice
before
his
prisoner
answered
but
at
length
richard
devine
raised
a
pale
face
which
stern
resolution
had
already
hardened
into
defiant
manhood
and
said
dawes
rufus
his
new
life
had
begun
already
for
that
night
one
rufus
dawes
charged
with
murder
and
robbery
lay
awake
in
prison
waiting
for
the
fortune
of
the
morrow
two
other
men
waited
as
eagerly
one
lionel
crofton
the
other
the
horseman
who
had
appointment
with
the
murdered
lord
bellasis
under
the
shadow
of
the
fir
trees
on
hampstead
heath
as
for
sir
richard
devine
he
waited
for
no
one
for
upon
reaching
his
room
he
had
fallen
senseless
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
book
the
sea
chapter
i
the
prison
ship
in
the
breathless
stillness
of
a
tropical
afternoon
when
the
air
was
hot
and
heavy
and
the
sky
brazen
and
cloudless
the
shadow
of
the
malabar
lay
solitary
on
the
surface
of
the
glittering
sea
the
sun
who
rose
on
the
left
hand
every
morning
a
blazing
ball
to
move
slowly
through
the
unbearable
blue
until
he
sank
fiery
red
in
mingling
glories
of
sky
and
ocean
on
the
right
hand
had
just
got
low
enough
to
peep
beneath
the
awning
that
covered
the
and
awaken
a
young
man
in
an
undress
military
uniform
who
was
dozing
on
a
coil
of
rope
hang
it
said
he
rising
and
stretching
himself
with
the
weary
sigh
of
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
do
i
must
have
been
asleep
and
then
holding
by
a
stay
he
turned
about
and
looked
down
into
the
waist
of
the
ship
save
for
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
the
guard
at
the
he
was
alone
on
the
deck
a
few
birds
flew
round
about
the
vessel
and
seemed
to
pass
under
her
stern
windows
only
to
appear
again
at
her
bows
a
lazy
albatross
with
the
white
water
flashing
from
his
wings
rose
with
a
dabbling
sound
to
leeward
and
in
the
place
where
he
had
been
glided
the
hideous
fin
of
a
shark
the
seams
of
the
deck
were
sticky
with
melted
pitch
and
the
brass
plate
of
the
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
a
jewel
there
was
no
breeze
and
as
the
clumsy
ship
rolled
and
lurched
on
the
heaving
sea
her
idle
sails
flapped
against
her
masts
with
a
regularly
recurring
noise
and
her
bowsprit
would
seem
to
rise
higher
with
the
water
swell
to
dip
again
with
a
jerk
that
made
each
rope
tremble
and
tauten
on
the
forecastle
some
soldiers
in
all
varieties
of
undress
were
playing
at
cards
smoking
or
watching
the
hanging
over
the
catheads
so
far
the
appearance
of
the
vessel
differed
in
no
wise
from
that
of
an
ordinary
transport
but
in
the
waist
a
curious
sight
presented
itself
it
was
as
though
one
had
built
a
there
at
the
foot
of
the
foremast
and
at
the
a
strong
barricade
and
furnished
with
doors
for
ingress
and
egress
ran
across
the
deck
from
bulwark
to
bulwark
outside
this
an
armed
sentry
stood
on
guard
inside
standing
sitting
or
walking
monotonously
within
range
of
the
shining
barrels
in
the
arm
chest
on
the
poop
were
some
sixty
men
and
boys
dressed
in
uniform
grey
the
men
and
boys
were
prisoners
of
the
crown
and
the
was
their
exercise
ground
their
prison
was
down
the
main
hatchway
on
the
decks
and
the
barricade
continued
down
made
its
side
walls
it
was
the
fag
end
of
the
two
hours
exercise
graciously
permitted
each
afternoon
by
his
majesty
king
george
the
fourth
to
prisoners
of
the
crown
and
the
prisoners
of
the
crown
were
enjoying
themselves
it
was
not
perhaps
so
pleasant
as
under
the
awning
on
the
but
that
sacred
shade
was
only
for
such
great
men
as
the
captain
and
his
officers
surgeon
pine
lieutenant
maurice
frere
and
most
important
personages
of
all
captain
vickers
and
his
wife
that
the
convict
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
would
like
to
have
been
able
to
get
rid
of
his
enemy
the
sun
for
a
moment
was
probable
enough
his
companions
sitting
on
the
combings
of
the
or
crouched
in
careless
fashion
on
the
shady
side
of
the
barricade
were
laughing
and
talking
with
blasphemous
and
obscene
merriment
hideous
to
contemplate
but
he
with
cap
pulled
over
his
brows
and
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
coarse
grey
garments
held
aloof
from
their
dismal
joviality
the
sun
poured
his
hottest
rays
on
his
head
unheeded
and
though
every
cranny
and
seam
in
the
deck
sweltered
hot
pitch
under
the
fierce
heat
the
man
stood
there
motionless
and
morose
staring
at
the
sleepy
sea
he
had
stood
thus
in
one
place
or
another
ever
since
the
groaning
vessel
had
escaped
from
the
rollers
of
the
bay
of
biscay
and
the
miserable
hundred
and
eighty
creatures
among
whom
he
was
classed
had
been
freed
from
their
irons
and
allowed
to
sniff
fresh
air
twice
a
day
the
ruffians
grouped
about
the
deck
cast
many
a
leer
of
contempt
at
the
solitary
figure
but
their
remarks
were
confined
to
gestures
only
there
are
degrees
in
crime
and
rufus
dawes
the
convicted
felon
who
had
but
escaped
the
gallows
to
toil
for
all
his
life
in
irons
was
a
man
of
mark
he
had
been
tried
for
the
robbery
and
murder
of
lord
bellasis
the
friendless
vagabond
lame
story
of
finding
on
the
heath
a
dying
man
would
not
have
availed
him
but
for
the
curious
fact
sworn
to
by
the
landlord
of
the
spaniards
inn
that
the
murdered
nobleman
had
shaken
his
head
when
asked
if
the
prisoner
was
his
assassin
the
vagabond
was
acquitted
of
the
murder
but
condemned
to
death
for
the
robbery
and
london
who
took
some
interest
in
the
trial
considered
him
fortunate
when
his
sentence
was
commuted
to
transportation
for
life
it
was
customary
on
board
these
floating
prisons
to
keep
each
crime
a
secret
from
his
fellows
so
that
if
he
chose
and
the
caprice
of
his
gaolers
allowed
him
he
could
lead
a
new
life
in
his
adopted
home
without
being
taunted
with
his
former
misdeeds
but
like
other
excellent
devices
the
expedient
was
only
a
nominal
one
and
few
out
of
the
doomed
hundred
and
eighty
were
ignorant
of
the
offence
which
their
companions
had
committed
the
more
guilty
boasted
of
their
superiority
in
vice
the
petty
criminals
swore
that
their
guilt
was
blacker
than
it
appeared
moreover
a
deed
so
bloodthirsty
and
a
respite
so
unexpected
had
invested
the
name
of
rufus
dawes
with
a
grim
distinction
which
his
superior
mental
abilities
no
less
than
his
haughty
temper
and
powerful
frame
combined
to
support
a
young
man
of
owning
to
no
friends
and
existing
among
them
but
by
the
fact
of
his
criminality
he
was
respected
and
admired
the
vilest
of
all
the
vile
horde
penned
between
decks
if
they
laughed
at
his
fine
airs
behind
his
back
cringed
and
submitted
when
they
met
him
face
to
face
for
in
a
convict
ship
the
greatest
villain
is
the
greatest
hero
and
the
only
nobility
acknowledged
by
that
hideous
commonwealth
is
that
order
of
the
halter
which
is
conferred
by
the
hand
of
the
hangman
the
young
man
on
the
poop
caught
sight
of
the
tall
figure
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
and
it
gave
him
an
excuse
to
break
the
monotony
of
his
employment
here
you
he
called
with
an
oath
get
out
of
the
gangway
rufus
dawes
was
not
in
the
gangway
was
in
fact
a
good
two
feet
from
it
but
at
the
sound
of
lieutenant
frere
voice
he
started
and
went
obediently
towards
the
hatchway
touch
your
hat
you
dog
cries
frere
coming
to
the
touch
your
damned
hat
do
you
hear
rufus
dawes
touched
his
cap
saluting
in
half
military
fashion
make
some
of
you
fellows
smart
if
you
do
have
a
care
went
on
the
angry
frere
half
to
himself
insolent
blackguards
and
then
the
noise
of
the
sentry
on
the
below
him
grounding
arms
turned
the
current
of
his
thoughts
a
thin
tall
man
with
a
cold
blue
eye
and
prim
features
came
out
of
the
cuddy
below
handing
out
a
affected
mincing
lady
of
middle
age
captain
vickers
of
frere
regiment
ordered
for
service
in
van
diemen
land
was
bringing
his
lady
on
deck
to
get
an
appetite
for
dinner
vickers
was
she
owned
to
and
had
been
a
for
eleven
weary
years
before
she
married
prim
john
vickers
the
marriage
was
not
a
happy
one
vickers
found
his
wife
extravagant
vain
and
snappish
and
she
found
him
harsh
disenchanted
and
commonplace
a
daughter
born
two
years
after
their
marriage
was
the
only
link
that
bound
the
pair
vickers
idolized
little
sylvia
and
when
the
recommendation
of
a
long
for
his
failing
health
induced
him
to
exchange
into
the
th
he
insisted
upon
bringing
the
child
with
him
despite
vickers
reiterated
objections
on
the
score
of
educational
difficulties
he
could
educate
her
himself
if
need
be
he
said
and
she
should
not
stay
at
so
vickers
after
a
hard
struggle
gave
up
the
point
and
her
dreams
of
bath
together
and
followed
her
husband
with
the
best
grace
she
could
muster
when
fairly
out
to
sea
she
seemed
reconciled
to
her
fate
and
employed
the
intervals
between
scolding
her
daughter
and
her
maid
in
fascinating
the
boorish
young
lieutenant
maurice
frere
fascination
was
an
integral
portion
of
julia
vickers
nature
admiration
was
all
she
lived
for
and
even
in
a
convict
ship
with
her
husband
at
her
elbow
she
must
flirt
or
perish
of
mental
inanition
there
was
no
harm
in
the
creature
she
was
simply
a
vain
woman
and
frere
took
her
attentions
for
what
they
were
worth
moreover
her
good
feeling
towards
him
was
useful
for
reasons
which
will
shortly
appear
running
down
the
ladder
cap
in
hand
he
offered
her
his
assistance
thank
you
frere
these
horrid
ladders
i
really
he
he
quite
tremble
at
them
hot
yes
dear
me
most
oppressive
john
the
pray
frere
oh
thank
you
sylvia
sylvia
john
have
you
my
smelling
salts
still
a
calm
i
suppose
these
dreadful
calms
this
within
twenty
yards
of
the
wild
den
on
the
other
side
of
the
barricade
sounded
strange
but
frere
thought
nothing
of
it
familiarity
destroys
terror
and
the
incurable
flirt
fluttered
her
muslins
and
played
off
her
graces
under
the
noses
of
the
grinning
convicts
with
as
much
complacency
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
chatham
indeed
if
there
had
been
nobody
else
near
it
is
not
unlikely
that
she
would
have
disdainfully
fascinated
the
and
made
eyes
at
the
most
presentable
of
the
convicts
there
vickers
with
a
bow
to
frere
saw
his
wife
up
the
ladder
and
then
turned
for
his
daughter
she
was
a
child
of
six
years
old
with
blue
eyes
and
bright
hair
though
indulged
by
her
father
and
spoiled
by
her
mother
the
natural
sweetness
of
her
disposition
saved
her
from
being
disagreeable
and
the
effects
of
her
education
as
yet
only
showed
themselves
in
a
thousand
imperious
prettinesses
which
made
her
the
darling
of
the
ship
little
miss
sylvia
was
privileged
to
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
and
even
convictism
shut
its
foul
mouth
in
her
presence
running
to
her
father
side
the
child
chattered
with
all
the
volubility
of
flattered
she
ran
hither
and
thither
asked
questions
invented
answers
laughed
sang
gambolled
peered
into
the
felt
in
the
pockets
of
the
man
at
the
helm
put
her
tiny
hand
into
the
big
palm
of
the
officer
of
the
watch
even
ran
down
to
the
and
pulled
the
of
the
sentry
on
duty
at
last
tired
of
running
about
she
took
a
little
striped
leather
ball
from
the
bosom
of
her
frock
and
calling
to
her
father
threw
it
up
to
him
as
he
stood
on
the
poop
he
returned
it
and
shouting
with
laughter
clapping
her
hands
between
each
throw
the
child
kept
up
the
game
the
convicts
whose
slice
of
fresh
air
was
nearly
eaten
turned
with
eagerness
to
watch
this
new
source
of
amusement
innocent
laughter
and
childish
prattle
were
strange
to
them
some
smiled
and
nodded
with
interest
in
the
varying
fortunes
of
the
game
one
young
lad
could
hardly
restrain
himself
from
applauding
it
was
as
though
out
of
the
sultry
heat
which
brooded
over
the
ship
a
cool
breeze
had
suddenly
arisen
in
the
midst
of
this
mirth
the
officer
of
the
watch
glancing
round
the
fast
crimsoning
horizon
paused
abruptly
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
looked
out
intently
to
the
westward
frere
who
found
vickers
conversation
a
little
tiresome
and
had
been
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
the
companion
as
though
in
expectation
of
someone
appearing
noticed
the
action
what
is
it
best
i
do
know
exactly
it
looks
to
me
like
a
cloud
of
and
taking
the
glass
he
swept
the
horizon
let
me
see
said
frere
and
he
looked
also
on
the
extreme
horizon
just
to
the
left
of
the
sinking
sun
rested
or
seemed
to
rest
a
tiny
black
cloud
the
gold
and
crimson
splashed
all
about
the
sky
had
overflowed
around
it
and
rendered
a
clear
view
almost
impossible
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
says
frere
handing
back
the
telescope
we
can
see
as
soon
as
the
sun
goes
down
a
then
vickers
must
of
course
look
also
and
was
prettily
affected
about
the
focus
of
the
glass
applying
herself
to
that
instrument
with
much
girlish
giggling
and
finally
declaring
after
shutting
one
eye
with
her
fair
hand
that
positively
she
could
see
nothing
but
sky
and
believed
that
wicked
frere
was
doing
it
on
by
and
by
captain
blunt
appeared
and
taking
the
glass
from
his
officer
looked
through
it
long
and
carefully
then
the
mizentop
was
appealed
to
and
declared
that
he
could
see
nothing
and
at
last
the
sun
went
down
with
a
jerk
as
though
it
had
slipped
through
a
slit
in
the
sea
and
the
black
spot
swallowed
up
in
the
gathering
haze
was
seen
no
more
as
the
sun
sank
the
relief
guard
came
up
the
after
hatchway
and
the
relieved
guard
prepared
to
superintend
the
descent
of
the
convicts
at
this
moment
sylvia
missed
her
ball
which
taking
advantage
of
a
sudden
lurch
of
the
vessel
hopped
over
the
barricade
and
rolled
to
the
feet
of
rufus
dawes
who
was
still
leaning
apparently
lost
in
thought
against
the
side
the
bright
spot
of
colour
rolling
across
the
white
deck
caught
his
eye
stooping
mechanically
he
picked
up
the
ball
and
stepped
forward
to
return
it
the
door
of
the
barricade
was
open
and
the
sentry
a
young
soldier
occupied
in
staring
at
the
relief
guard
did
not
notice
the
prisoner
pass
through
it
in
another
instant
he
was
on
the
sacred
heated
with
the
game
her
cheeks
aglow
her
eyes
sparkling
her
golden
hair
afloat
sylvia
had
turned
to
leap
after
her
plaything
but
even
as
she
turned
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
cuddy
glided
a
rounded
white
arm
and
a
shapely
hand
caught
the
child
by
the
sash
and
drew
her
back
the
next
moment
the
young
man
in
grey
had
placed
the
toy
in
her
hand
maurice
frere
descending
the
poop
ladder
had
not
witnessed
this
little
incident
on
reaching
the
deck
he
saw
only
the
unexplained
presence
of
the
convict
uniform
thank
you
said
a
voice
as
rufus
dawes
stooped
before
the
pouting
sylvia
the
convict
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
a
young
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
of
age
tall
and
well
developed
who
dressed
in
a
robe
of
some
white
material
was
standing
in
the
doorway
she
had
black
hair
coiled
around
a
narrow
and
flat
head
a
small
foot
white
skin
hands
and
large
dark
eyes
and
as
she
smiled
at
him
her
scarlet
lips
showed
her
white
even
teeth
he
knew
her
at
once
she
was
sarah
purfoy
vickers
maid
but
he
never
had
been
so
close
to
her
before
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
some
strange
tropical
flower
which
exhaled
a
heavy
and
intoxicating
perfume
for
an
instant
the
two
looked
at
each
other
and
then
rufus
dawes
was
seized
from
behind
by
his
collar
and
flung
with
a
shock
upon
the
deck
leaping
to
his
feet
his
first
impulse
was
to
rush
upon
his
assailant
but
he
saw
the
ready
bayonet
of
the
sentry
gleam
and
he
checked
himself
with
an
effort
for
his
assailant
was
maurice
frere
what
the
devil
do
you
do
here
asked
the
gentleman
with
an
oath
you
lazy
skulking
hound
what
brings
you
here
if
i
catch
you
putting
your
foot
on
the
again
i
give
you
a
week
in
irons
rufus
dawes
pale
with
rage
and
mortification
opened
his
mouth
to
justify
himself
but
he
allowed
the
words
to
die
on
his
lips
what
was
the
use
go
down
below
and
remember
what
i
told
you
cried
frere
and
comprehending
at
once
what
had
occurred
he
made
a
mental
minute
of
the
name
of
the
defaulting
sentry
the
convict
wiping
the
blood
from
his
face
turned
on
his
heel
without
a
word
and
went
back
through
the
strong
oak
door
into
his
den
frere
leant
forward
and
took
the
girl
shapely
hand
with
an
easy
gesture
but
she
drew
it
away
with
a
flash
of
her
black
eyes
you
coward
she
said
the
stolid
soldier
close
beside
them
heard
it
and
his
eye
twinkled
frere
bit
his
thick
lips
with
mortification
as
he
followed
the
girl
into
the
cuddy
sarah
purfoy
however
taking
the
astonished
sylvia
by
the
hand
glided
into
her
mistress
cabin
with
a
scornful
laugh

shut
the
door
behind
her

with

pompously

the
subject

was
even
more
distasteful
to

than

interminable

and
vickers
hastened
to
change
the
subject
are
you
not
heartily
tired
of
this
dreadful
life
frere
well
it
is
not
exactly
the
life
i

frere
rubbing
a
freckled
hand
over
his
stubborn
red

but
i
must
make
the
best
of
yes
indeed
said
the
lady
in
that
subdued
manner
with
which
one
comments
upon
a
accident
it
must
have
been
a
great
shock
to
you
to
be
so
suddenly
deprived
of
so
large
a
not
only
that
but
to
find
that
the
black
sheep
who
got
it
all
sailed
for
india
within
a
week
of
my
uncle
death
lady
devine
got
a
letter
from
him
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
to
say
that
he
had
taken
his
passage
in
the
hydaspes
for
calcutta
and
never
meant
to
come
back
again
sir
richard

left
no
other
children
no
only
this
mysterious
dick
whom
i
never
saw
but
who
must
have
hated
dear
dear
these
family
quarrels
are
dreadful
things
poor
lady
devine
to
lose
in
one
day
a
husband
and
a
son
and
the
next
morning
to
hear
of
the
murder
of
her
cousin
you
know
that
we
are
connected
with
the
bellasis
family
my
aunt
father
married
a
sister
of
the
second
lord
indeed
that
was
a
horrible
murder
so
you
think
that
the
dreadful
man
you
pointed
out
the
other
day
did
it
the
jury
seemed
to
think
not
said
frere
with
a
laugh
but
i
do
know
anybody
else
who
could
have
a
motive
for
it
however
i
go
on
deck
and
have
a
i
wonder
what
induced
that
old
hunks
of
a
shipbuilder
to
try
to
cut
off
his
only
son
in
favour
of
a
cub
of
that
sort
said
surgeon
pine
to
captain
vickers
as
the
broad
back
of
maurice
frere
disappeared
up
the
companion
some
boyish
follies
abroad
i
believe
men
are
always
impatient
of
extravagance
but
it
is
hard
upon
frere
he
is
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
for
all
his
roughness
and
when
a
young
man
finds
that
an
accident
deprives
him
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
and
leaves
him
without
a
sixpence
beyond
his
commission
in
a
marching
regiment
under
orders
for
a
convict
settlement
he
has
some
reason
to
rail
against
how
was
it
that
the
son
came
in
for
the
money
after
all
then
why
it
seems
that
when
old
devine
returned
from
sending
for
his
lawyer
to
alter
his
will
he
got
a
fit
of
apoplexy
the
result
of
his
rage
i
suppose
and
when
they
opened
his
room
door
in
the
morning
they
found
him
and
the
son
away
on
the
sea
somewhere
said
vickers
and
knows
nothing
of
his
good
fortune
it
is
quite
a
i
am
glad
that
frere
did
not
get
the
money
said
pine
grimly
sticking
to
his
prejudice
i
have
seldom
seen
a
face
i
liked
less
even
among
my
yellow
jackets
oh
dear
pine
how
can
you
interjected
vickers
my
soul
some
of
them
have
mixed
in
good
society
i
can
tell
you
there
pickpockets
and
swindlers
down
below
who
have
lived
in
the
best
dreadful
wretches
cried
vickers
shaking
out
her
skirts
john
i
will
go
on
at
the
signal
the
party
rose
ecod
pine
says
captain
blunt
as
the
two
were
left
alone
together
you
and
i
are
always
putting
our
foot
into
it
women
are
always
in
the
way
aboard
ship
returned
pine
ah
doctor
you
do
mean
that
i
know
said
a
rich
soft
voice
at
his
elbow
it
was
sarah
purfoy
emerging
from
her
cabin
here
is
the
wench
cries
blunt
we
are
talking
of
your
eyes
my
well
they
bear
talking
about
captain
wo
they
asked
she
turning
them
full
upon
him
by
the
lord
they
will
says
blunt
smacking
his
hand
on
the
table
they
the
finest
eyes
i
seen
in
my
life
and
they
got
the
reddest
lips
under
that
let
me
pass
captain
blunt
if
you
please
thank
you
and
before
the
admiring
commander
could
prevent
her
she
modestly
swept
out
of
the
cuddy
she
a
fine
piece
of
goods
eh
asked
blunt
watching
her
a
spice
o
the
devil
in
her
old
pine
took
a
huge
pinch
of
snuff
devil
i
tell
you
what
it
is
blunt
i
do
know
where
vickers
picked
her
up
but
i
rather
trust
my
life
with
the
worst
of
those
ruffians
decks
than
in
her
keeping
if
i
done
her
an
blunt
laughed
i
do
believe
she
think
much
of
sticking
a
man
either
he
said
rising
but
i
must
go
on
deck
pine
followed
him
more
slowly
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
women
he
said
to
himself
but
that
girl
got
a
story
of
her
own
or
i
much
mistaken
what
brings
her
on
board
this
ship
as
is
more
than
i
can
and
as
sticking
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
walked
down
the
now
deserted
deck
to
the
main
hatchway
and
turned
to
watch
the
white
figure
gliding
up
and
down
the
he
saw
it
joined
by
another
and
a
darker
one
he
muttered
she
after
no
good
i
at
that
moment
his
arm
was
touched
by
a
soldier
in
undress
uniform
who
had
come
up
the
hatchway
what
is
it
the
man
drew
himself
up
and
saluted
if
you
please
doctor
one
of
the
prisoners
is
taken
sick
and
as
the
dinner
over
and
he
pretty
bad
i
ventured
to
disturb
your
you
ass
says
pine
who
like
many
gruff
men
had
a
good
heart
under
his
rough
shell
why
did
you
tell
me
before
and
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
he
stopped
that
implement
with
a
twist
of
paper
and
followed
his
summoner
down
the
hatchway
in
the
meantime
the
woman
who
was
the
object
of
the
grim
old
suspicions
was
enjoying
the
comparative
coolness
of
the
night
air
her
mistress
and
her
mistress
daughter
had
not
yet
come
out
of
their
cabin
and
the
men
had
not
yet
finished
their
evening
tobacco
the
awning
had
been
removed
the
stars
were
shining
in
the
moonless
sky
the
poop
guard
had
shifted
itself
to
the
and
miss
sarah
purfoy
was
walking
up
and
down
the
deserted
poop
in
close
with
no
less
a
person
than
captain
blunt
himself
she
had
passed
and
repassed
him
twice
silently
and
at
the
third
turn
the
big
fellow
peering
into
the
twilight
ahead
somewhat
uneasily
obeyed
the
glitter
of
her
great
eyes
and
joined
her
you
were
put
out
my
wench
he
asked
at
what
i
said
to
you
below
she
affected
surprise
what
do
you
mean
why
at
my
at
what
i
at
my
rudeness
there
for
i
was
a
bit
rude
i
i
oh
dear
no
you
were
not
glad
you
think
so
returned
phineas
blunt
a
little
ashamed
at
what
looked
like
a
confession
of
weakness
on
his
part
you
would
have
been
if
i
had
let
how
do
you
know
i
saw
it
in
your
face

woman

to
insult
her

word

girl

at
him
with
a
quick
side
glance

lieutenant
frere
i
suppose

you
jealous
of
him
jealous
why
damme
the
lad

a
stupid
booby
though

is
lieutenant
so

you
are
right
there
by
the
sarah
purfoy
laughed
a
low
laugh
whose
sound
made
pulse
take
a
jump
forward
and
sent
the
blood
tingling
down
to
his
fingers
ends
captain
blunt
said
she
you
going
to
do
a
very
silly
he
came
close
to
her
and
tried
to
take
her
hand
what
she
answered
by
another
question
how
old
are
you
if
you
must
oh
and
you
are
going
to
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
of
who
is
that
myself
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
and
smiling
at
him
with
her
rich
red
lips
the
mizen
hid
them
from
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
the
twilight
of
tropical
stars
held
the
blunt
felt
the
breath
of
this
strange
woman
warm
on
his
cheek
her
eyes
seemed
to
wax
and
wane
and
the
hard
small
hand
he
held
burnt
like
fire
i
believe
you
are
right
he
cried
i
am
half
in
love
with
you
she
gazed
at
him
with
a
contemptuous
sinking
of
her
heavily
fringed
eyelids
and
withdrew
her
hand
then
do
get
to
the
other
half
or
you
regret
shall
i
asked
blunt
that
my
affair
come
you
little
vixen
give
me
that
kiss
you
said
i
was
going
to
ask
you
for
below
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
in
an
instant
she
had
twisted
herself
free
and
confronted
him
with
flashing
eyes
you
dare
she
cried
kiss
me
by
force
pooh
you
make
love
like
a
schoolboy
if
you
can
make
me
like
you
i
kiss
you
as
often
as
you
will
if
you
ca
keep
your
distance
blunt
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
be
angry
at
this
rebuff
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
in
rather
a
ridiculous
position
and
so
decided
to
laugh
you
a
spitfire
too
what
must
i
do
to
make
you
like
me
she
made
him
a
curtsy
that
is
your
affair
she
said
and
as
the
head
of
frere
appeared
above
the
companion
blunt
walked
aft
feeling
considerably
bewildered
and
yet
not
displeased
she
a
fine
girl
by
jingo
he
said
cocking
his
cap
and
i
hanged
if
she
ai
sweet
upon
and
then
the
old
fellow
began
to
whistle
softly
to
himself
as
he
paced
the
deck
and
to
glance
towards
the
man
who
had
taken
his
place
with
no
friendly
eyes
but
a
sort
of
shame
held
him
as
yet
and
he
kept
aloof
maurice
frere
greeting
was
short
enough
well
sarah
he
said
have
you
got
out
of
your
temper
she
frowned
what
did
you
strike
the
man
for
he
did
you
no
he
was
out
of
his
place
what
business
had
he
to
come
aft
one
must
keep
these
wretches
down
my
or
they
will
be
too
much
for
you
eh
do
you
think
one
man
could
capture
a
ship
maurice
no
but
one
hundred
nonsense
what
could
they
do
against
the
soldiers
there

fifty
so

the
rules
and
i
wo

to

king
regulations

frere
laughed
at
her
imitation
of
his
pompous
captain
you

a
strange
girl
i
ca
make
you
out

and
he
took
her
hand
tell
me

your
word

my

the
advertisement
i
but
i
mean
what

all

life
she
pulled
her
shawl
closer
round
her
and
shivered
people

not
born
ladies
maids
i
suppose
well
who
are
you
then
have
you
no
friends
what
have
you
been
she
looked
up
into
the
young
man
face
a
little
less
harsh
at
that
moment
than
it
was
wont
to
be
and
creeping
closer
to
him
whispered
do
you
love
me
maurice
he
raised
one
of
the
little
hands
that
rested
on
the
taffrail
and
under
cover
of
the
darkness
kissed
it
you
know
i
do
he
said
you
may
be
a
or
what
you
like
but
you
are
the
loveliest
woman
i
ever
she
smiled
at
his
vehemence
then
if
you
love
me
what
does
it
matter
if
you
loved
me
you
would
tell
me
said
he
with
a
quickness
which
surprised
himself
but
i
have
nothing
to
tell
and
i
do
love
you
he
let
her
hand
fall
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
at
that
moment
blunt
who
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
came
up
fine
night
frere
yes
fine
no
signs
of
a
breeze
yet
no
not
just
then
from
out
of
the
violet
haze
that
hung
over
the
horizon
a
strange
glow
of
light
broke
hallo
cries
frere
did
you
see
that
all
had
seen
it
but
they
looked
for
its
repetition
in
vain
blunt
rubbed
his
eyes
i
saw
it
he
said
distinctly
a
flash
of
they
strained
their
eyes
to
pierce
through
the
obscurity
best
saw
something
like
it
before
dinner
there
must
be
thunder
in
the
at
that
instant
a
thin
streak
of
light
shot
up
and
then
sank
again
there
was
no
mistaking
it
this
time
and
a
simultaneous
exclamation
burst
from
all
on
deck
from
out
the
gloom
which
hung
over
the
horizon
rose
a
column
of
flame
that
lighted
up
the
night
for
an
instant
and
then
sunk
leaving
a
dull
red
spark
upon
the
water
it
a
ship
on
fire
cried
frere
chapter
iii
the
monotony
breaks
they
looked
again
the
tiny
spark
still
burned
and
immediately
over
it
there
grew
out
of
the
darkness
a
crimson
spot
that
hung
like
a
lurid
star
in
the
air
the
soldiers
and
sailors
on
the
forecastle
had
seen
it
also
and
in
a
moment
the
whole
vessel
was
astir
vickers
with
little
sylvia
clinging
to
her
dress
came
up
to
share
the
new
sensation
and
at
the
sight
of
her
mistress
the
modest
maid
withdrew
discreetly
from
frere
side
not
that
there
was
any
need
to
do
so
no
one
heeded
her
blunt
in
his
professional
excitement
had
already
forgotten
her
presence
and
frere
was
in
earnest
conversation
with
vickers
take
a
boat
said
that
gentleman
certainly
my
dear
frere
by
all
means
that
is
to
say
if
the
captain
does
not
object
and
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
captain
you
lower
a
boat
eh
we
may
save
some
of
the
poor
devils
cries
frere
his
heartiness
of
body
reviving
at
the
prospect
of
excitement
boat
said
blunt
why
she
twelve
miles
off
and
more
and
not
a
breath
o
wind
but
we
ca
let
roast
like
chestnuts
cried
the
other
as
the
glow
in
the
sky
broadened
and
became
more
intense
what
is
the
good
of
a
boat
said
pine
the
only
holds
thirty
men
and
that
a
big
ship
well
take
two
boats
three
boats
by
heaven
you
never
let
burn
alive
without
stirring
a
finger
to
save
they
got
their
own
boats
says
blunt
whose
coolness
was
in
strong
contrast
to
the
young
officer
impetuosity
and
if
the
fire
gains
they
take
to
you
may
depend
in
the
meantime
we
show
that
there
someone
near
and
as
he
spoke
a
blue
light
flared
hissing
into
the
night
there
they
see
that
i
expect
he
said
as
the
ghastly
flame
rose
extinguishing
the
stars
for
a
moment
only
to
let
them
appear
again
brighter
in
a
darker
heaven
mr
best
lower
and
man
the
frere
you
can
go
in
one
if
you
like
and
take
a
volunteer
or
two
from
those
grey
jackets
of
yours
amidships
i
shall
want
as
many
hands
as
i
can
spare
to
man
the
and
cutter
in
case
we
want
steady
there
lads
easy
and
as
the
first
eight
men
who
could
reach
the
deck
parted
to
the
larboard
and
starboard
frere
ran
down
on
the
vickers
of
course
was
in
the
way
and
gave
a
genteel
scream
as
blunt
rudely
pushed
past
her
with
a
apology
but
her
maid
was
standing
erect
and
motionless
by
the
and
as
the
captain
paused
for
a
moment
to
look
round
him
he
saw
her
dark
eyes
fixed
on
him
admiringly
he
was
as
he
said
over
burly
and
but
he
blushed
like
a
girl
under
her
approving
gaze
nevertheless
he
said
only
that
wench
is
a
trump
and
swore
a
little
meanwhile
maurice
frere
had
passed
the
sentry
and
leapt
down
into
the
decks
at
his
nod
the
prison
door
was
thrown
open
the
air
was
hot
and
that
strange
horrible
odour
peculiar
to
human
bodies
filled
the
place
it
was
like
coming
into
a
full
stable
he
ran
his
eye
down
the
double
tier
of
bunks
which
lined
the
side
of
the
ship
and
stopped
at
the
one
opposite
him
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
disturbance
there
lately
for
instead
of
the
six
pair
of
feet
which
should
have
protruded
therefrom
the
gleam
of
the
showed
but
four
what
the
matter
here

he
asked

ill

him
to
but
there
should
be
the
other
came
from
behind
the
break
of
the
berths
it
was
rufus
dawes
he
held
by
the
side
as
he
came
and
saluted
i
felt
sick
sir
and
was
trying
to
get
the
scuttle
the
heads
were
all
raised
along
the
silent
line
and
eyes
and
ears
were
eager
to
see
and
listen
the
double
tier
of
bunks
looked
terribly
like
a
row
of
wild
beast
cages
at
that
moment
maurice
frere
stamped
his
foot
indignantly
sick
what
are
you
sick
about
you
malingering
dog
i
give
you
something
to
sweat
the
sickness
out
of
you
stand
on
one
side
here
rufus
dawes
wondering
obeyed
he
seemed
heavy
and
dejected
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
as
though
he
would
rub
away
a
pain
there
which
of
you
fellows
can
handle

frere
went
on
there
curse
you
i
do
want
fifty
three
do
come
on
now
make
haste
the
heavy
door
clashed
again
and
in
another
instant
the
four
volunteers
were
on
deck
the
crimson
glow
was
turning
yellow
now
and
spreading
over
the
sky
two
in
each
boat
cries
blunt
i
burn
a
blue
light
every
hour
for
you
best
and
take
care
they
do
swamp
you
lower
away
lads
as
the
second
prisoner
took
the
oar
of
frere
boat
he
uttered
a
groan
and
fell
forward
recovering
himself
instantly
sarah
purfoy
leaning
over
the
side
saw
the
occurrence
what
is
the
matter
with
that
man
she
said
is
he
ill
pine
was
next
to
her
and
looked
out
instantly
it
that
big
fellow
in
no
he
cried
here
frere
but
frere
heard
him
not
he
was
intent
on
the
beacon
that
gleamed
ever
brighter
in
the
distance
give
way
my
lads
he
shouted
and
amid
a
cheer
from
the
ship
the
two
boats
shot
out
of
the
bright
circle
of
the
blue
light
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
sarah
purfoy
looked
at
pine
for
an
explanation
but
he
turned
abruptly
away
for
a
moment
the
girl
paused
as
if
in
doubt
and
then
ere
his
retreating
figure
turned
to
retrace
its
steps
she
cast
a
quick
glance
around
and
slipping
down
the
ladder
made
her
way
to
the
decks
the
oak
barricade
that
for
musketry
and
perforated
with
plated
trapdoor
for
sterner
needs
separated
soldiers
from
prisoners
was
close
to
her
left
hand
and
the
sentry
at
its
padlocked
door
looked
at
her
inquiringly
she
laid
her
little
hand
on
his
big
rough
one
a
sentry
is
but
mortal
and
opened
her
brown
eyes
at
him
the
hospital
she
said
the
doctor
sent
me
and
before
he
could
answer
her
white
figure
vanished
down
the
hatch
and
passed
round
the
bulkhead
behind
which
lay
the
sick
man
chapter
iv
the
hospital
the
hospital
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
partitioned
portion
of
the
lower
deck
filched
from
the
space
allotted
to
the
soldiers
it
ran
fore
and
aft
coming
close
to
the
stern
windows
and
was
in
fact
a
sort
of
artificial
stern
cabin
at
a
pinch
it
might
have
held
a
dozen
men
though
not
so
hot
as
in
the
prison
the
atmosphere
of
the
lower
deck
was
close
and
unhealthy
and
the
girl
pausing
to
listen
to
the
subdued
hum
of
conversation
coming
from
the
soldiers
berths
turned
strangely
sick
and
giddy
she
drew
herself
up
however
and
held
out
her
hand
to
a
man
who
came
rapidly
across
the
misshapen
shadows
thrown
by
the
sulkily
swinging
lantern
to
meet
her
it
was
the
young
soldier
who
had
been
that
day
sentry
at
the
convict
gangway
well
miss
he
said
i
am
here
yer
see
waiting
for
you
are
a
good
boy
miles
but
do
you
think
i
worth
waiting
for
miles
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
indeed
you
be
said
he
sarah
purfoy
frowned
and
then
smiled
come
here
miles
i
got
something
for
miles
came
forward
grinning
harder
the
girl
produced
a
small
object
from
the
pocket
of
her
dress
if
vickers
had
seen
it
she
would
probably
have
been
angry
for
it
was
nothing
less
than
the
captain
drink
said
she
it
the
same
as
they
have
upstairs
so
it
hurt
the
fellow
needed
no
pressing
he
took
off
half
the
contents
of
the
bottle
at
a
gulp
and
then
fetching
a
long
breath
stood
staring
at
her
that
prime
is
it
i
dare
say
it
she
had
been
looking
at
him
with
unaffected
disgust
as
he
drank
brandy
is
all
you
men
miles
still
sucking
in
his
breath
came
a
pace
closer
not
it
said
he
with
a
twinkle
in
his
little
pig
eyes
i
understand
something
else
miss
i
can
tell
the
tone
of
the
sentence
seemed
to
awaken
and
remind
her
of
her
errand
in
that
place
she
laughed
as
loudly
and
as
merrily
as
she
dared
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
speaker
arm
the
boy
for
he
was
but
a
boy
one
of
those
many
country
louts
who
leave
the
for
the
musket
and
for
a
shilling
a
day
experience
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
there
that
quite
close
enough
you
only
a
common
soldier
miles
and
you
must
make
love
to
not
make
love
to
yer
says
miles
what
did
yer
tell
me
to
meet
yer
here
for
then
she
laughed
again
what
a
practical
animal
you
are
suppose
i
had
something
to
say
to
you
miles
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
it
hard
to
marry
a
soldier
he
said
with
a
recruit
proud
intonation
of
the
word
but
yer
might
do
worse
miss
and
i
work
for
yer
like
a
slave
i
she
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
and
pleasure
though
her
time
was
evidently
precious
she
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
listening
to
praises
of
herself
i
know
you
above
me
miss
sarah
you
a
lady
but
i
love
yer
i
do
and
you
drives
me
wild
with
yer
do
i
do
yer
yes
yer
do
what
did
yer
come
an
make
up
to
me
for
and
then
go
sweetheartin
with
them
others
what
others
why
the
cuddy
folk
the
skipper
and
the
parson
and
that
frere
i
see
yer
walkin
the
deck
wi
un
o
nights
dom
i
put
a
bullet
through
his
red
head
as
soon
as
look
at
hush
miles
dear
they
hear
her
face
was
all
aglow
and
her
expanded
nostrils
throbbed
beautiful
as
the
face
was
it
had
a
tigerish
look
about
it
at
that
moment
encouraged
by
the
epithet
miles
put
his
arm
round
her
slim
waist
just
as
blunt
had
done
but
she
did
not
resent
it
so
abruptly
miles
had
promised
more
hush
she
whispered
with
surprise
i
heard
a
noise
and
as
the
soldier
started
back
she
smoothed
her
dress
complacently
there
is
no
one
cried
he
is
there
my
mistake
then
now
come
here
miles
obeyed
who
is
in
the
hospital
i
well
i
want
to
go
miles
scratched
his
head
and
grinned
yer
why
not
you
let
me
in
against
the
doctor
orders
he
told
me
special
to
let
no
one
in
but
it
ai
nonsense
there
was
a
convict
brought
in
and
nobody
to
go
near
a
convict
she
grew
more
interested
what
the
matter
with
him
dunno
but
he
to
be
kep
quiet
until
old
pine
comes
she
became
authoritative
come
miles
let
me
go
do
ask
me
miss
it
against
orders
and
against
orders
why
you
were
blustering
about
shooting
people
just
the
badgered
miles
grew
angry
was
i
bluster
or
no
bluster
you
go
she
turned
away
oh
very
well
if
this
is
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
wasting
my
time
down
here
i
shall
go
on
deck
miles
became
uneasy
there
are
plenty
of
agreeable
people
miles
took
a
step
after
her
mr
frere
will
let
me
go
in
i
dare
say
if
i
ask
miles
swore
under
his
breath
dom
frere
go
in
if
yer
like
he
said
i
wo
stop
yer
but
remember
what
i
doin
she
turned
again
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
came
quickly
back
that
a
good
lad
i
knew
you
would
not
refuse
me
and
smiling
at
the
poor
lad
she
was
befooling
she
passed
into
the
cabin
there
was
no
lantern
and
from
the
stern
windows
came
only
a
dim
vaporous
light
the
dull
ripple
of
the
water
as
the
ship
rocked
on
the
slow
swell
of
the
sea
made
a
melancholy
sound
and
the
sick
man
heavy
breathing
seemed
to
fill
the
air
the
slight
noise
made
by
the
opening
door
roused
him
he
rose
on
his
elbow
and
began
to
mutter
sarah
purfoy
paused
in
the
doorway
to
listen
but
she
could
make
nothing
of
the
low
uneasy
murmuring
raising
her
arm
conspicuous
by
its
white
sleeve
in
the
gloom
she
beckoned
miles
the
lantern
she
whispered
bring
me
the
lantern
he
unhooked
it
from
the
rope
where
it
swung
and
brought
it
towards
her
at
that
moment
the
man
in
the
bunk
sat
up
erect
and
twisted
himself
towards
the
light
sarah
he
cried
in
shrill
sharp
tones
sarah
and
swooped
with
a
lean
arm
through
the
dusk
as
though
to
seize
her
the
girl
leapt
out
of
the
cabin
like
a
panther
struck
the
lantern
out
of
her
lover
hand
and
was
back
at
the
in
a
moment
the
convict
was
a
young
man
of
about
his
hands
clutched
convulsively
now
on
the
blankets
were
small
and
and
the
unshaven
chin
bristled
with
promise
of
a
strong
beard
his
wild
black
eyes
glared
with
all
the
fire
of
delirium
and
as
he
gasped
for
breath
the
sweat
stood
in
beads
on
his
sallow
forehead
the
aspect
of
the
man
was
sufficiently
ghastly
and
miles
drawing
back
with
an
oath
did
not
wonder
at
the
terror
which
had
seized
vickers
maid
with
open
mouth
and
agonized
face
she
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
cabin
lantern
in
hand
like
one
turned
to
stone
gazing
at
the
man
on
the
bed
ecod
he
be
a
sight
says
miles
at
length
come
away
miss
and
shut
the
door
he
raving
i
tell
the
sound
of
his
voice
recalled
her
she
dropped
the
lantern
and
rushed
to
the
bed
you
fool
he
choking
ca
you
see
water
give
me
water
and
wreathing
her
arms
around
the
man
head
she
pulled
it
down
on
her
bosom
rocking
it
there
half
savagely
to
and
fro
awed
into
obedience
by
her
voice
miles
dipped
a
pannikin
into
a
small
puncheon
cleated
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
gave
it
her
and
without
thanking
him
she
placed
it
to
the
sick
prisoner
lips
he
drank
greedily
and
closed
his
eyes
with
a
grateful
sigh
just
then
the
quick
ears
of
miles
heard
the
jingle
of
arms
here
the
doctor
coming
miss
he
cried
i
hear
the
sentry
saluting
come
away
quick
she
seized
the
lantern
and
opening
the
horn
slide
extinguished
it
say
it
went
out
she
said
in
a
fierce
whisper
and
hold
your
tongue
leave
me
to
she
bent
over
the
convict
as
if
to
arrange
his
pillow
and
then
glided
out
of
the
cabin
just
as
pine
descended
the
hatchway
hallo
cried
he
stumbling
as
he
missed
his
footing
where
the
light
here
sir
says
miles
fumbling
with
the
lantern
it
all
right
sir
it
went
out
went
out
what
did
you
let
it
go
out
for
you
blockhead
growled
the
unsuspecting
pine
just
like
you
boobies
what
is
the
use
of
a
light
if
it
out
eh
as
he
groped
his
way
with
outstretched
arms
in
the
darkness
sarah
purfoy
slipped
past
him
unnoticed
and
gained
the
upper
deck
chapter
the
barracoon
in
the
prison
of
the
decks
reigned
a
darkness
pregnant
with
murmurs
the
sentry
at
the
entrance
to
the
hatchway
was
supposed
to
prevent
the
prisoners
from
making
a
noise
but
he
put
a
very
liberal
interpretation
upon
the
clause
and
so
long
as
the
prisoners
refrained
from
shouting
yelling
and
fighting
eccentricities
in
which
they
sometimes
indulged
he
did
not
disturb
them
this
course
of
conduct
was
dictated
by
prudence
no
less
than
by
convenience
for
one
sentry
was
but
little
over
so
many
and
the
convicts
if
pressed
too
hard
would
raise
a
sort
of
bestial
in
which
all
voices
were
confounded
and
which
while
it
made
noise
enough
and
to
spare
utterly
precluded
individual
punishment
one
could
not
flog
a
hundred
and
eighty
men
and
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
any
particular
offender
so
in
virtue
of
this
last
appeal
convictism
had
established
a
tacit
right
to
converse
in
whispers
and
to
move
about
inside
its
oaken
cage
to
one
coming
in
from
the
upper
air
the
place
would
have
seemed
in
pitchy
darkness
but
the
convict
eye
accustomed
to
the
sinister
twilight
was
enabled
to
discern
surrounding
objects
with
tolerable
distinctness
the
prison
was
about
fifty
feet
long
and
fifty
feet
wide
and
ran
the
full
height
of
the
decks
about
five
feet
ten
inches
high
the
barricade
was
here
and
there
and
the
planks
were
in
some
places
wide
enough
to
admit
a
musket
barrel
on
the
aft
side
next
the
soldiers
berths
was
a
trap
door
like
the
of
a
furnace
at
first
sight
this
appeared
to
be
contrived
for
the
humane
purpose
of
ventilation
but
a
second
glance
dispelled
this
weak
conclusion
the
opening
was
just
large
enough
to
admit
the
muzzle
of
a
small
howitzer
secured
on
the
deck
below
in
case
of
a
mutiny
the
soldiers
could
sweep
the
prison
from
end
to
end
with
grape
shot
such
fresh
air
as
there
was
filtered
through
the
loopholes
and
came
in
somewhat
larger
quantity
through
a
passed
into
the
prison
from
the
hatchway
but
the
being
necessarily
at
one
end
only
of
the
place
the
air
it
brought
was
pretty
well
absorbed
by
the
twenty
or
thirty
lucky
fellows
near
it
and
the
other
hundred
and
fifty
did
not
come
so
well
off
the
scuttles
were
open
certainly
but
as
the
row
of
bunks
had
been
built
against
them
the
air
they
brought
was
the
peculiar
property
of
such
men
as
occupied
the
berths
into
which
they
penetrated
these
berths
were
in
number
each
containing
six
men
they
ran
in
a
double
tier
round
three
sides
of
the
prison
twenty
at
each
side
and
eight
affixed
to
that
portion
of
the
forward
barricade
opposite
the
door
each
berth
was
presumed
to
be
five
feet
six
inches
square
but
the
necessities
of
stowage
had
deprived
them
of
six
inches
and
even
under
that
pressure
twelve
men
were
compelled
to
sleep
on
the
deck
pine
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
spoke
of
the
custom
of
overcrowding
convict
ships
and
as
he
was
entitled
to
half
a
guinea
for
every
man
he
delivered
alive
at
hobart
town
he
had
some
reason
to
complain
when
frere
had
come
down
an
hour
before
the
prisoners
were
all
snugly
between
their
blankets
they
were
not
so
now
though
at
the
first
clink
of
the
bolts
they
would
be
back
again
in
their
old
positions
to
all
appearances
sound
asleep
as
the
eye
became
accustomed
to
the
foetid
duskiness
of
the
prison
a
strange
picture
presented
itself
groups
of
men
in
all
imaginable
attitudes
were
lying
standing
sitting
or
pacing
up
and
down
it
was
the
scene
on
the
over
again
only
here
being
no
fear
of
restraining
keepers
the
wild
beasts
were
a
little
more
free
in
their
movements
it
is
impossible
to
convey
in
words
any
idea
of
the
hideous
phantasmagoria
of
shifting
limbs
and
faces
which
moved
through
the
twilight
of
this
terrible
callot
might
have
drawn
it
dante
might
have
suggested
it
but
a
minute
attempt
to
describe
its
horrors
would
but
disgust
there
are
depths
in
humanity
which
one
can
not
explore
as
there
are
mephitic
caverns
into
which
one
dare
not
penetrate
old
men
young
men
and
boys
stalwart
burglars
and
highway
robbers
slept
side
by
side
with
wizened
pickpockets
or
the
forger
occupied
the
same
berth
with
the
the
man
of
education
learned
strange
secrets
of
craft
and
the
vulgar
ruffian
of
giles
took
lessons
of
from
the
keener
intellect
of
the
professional
swindler
the
fraudulent
clerk
and
the
flash
cracksman
interchanged
experiences
the
stories
of
lucky
ventures
and
successful
runs
were
capped
by
the
footpad
reminiscences
of
foggy
nights
and
stolen
watches
the
poacher
grimly
thinking
of
his
sick
wife
and
orphaned
children
would
start
as
the
ruffian
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
bade
him
with
a
curse
to
take
good
heart
and
be
a
the
fast
shopboy
whose
love
of
fine
company
and
high
living
had
brought
him
to
this
pass
had
shaken
off
the
first
shame
that
was
on
him
and
listened
eagerly
to
the
narratives
of
successful
vice
that
fell
so
glibly
from
the
lips
of
his
older
companions
to
be
transported
seemed
no
such
uncommon
fate
the
old
fellows
laughed
and
wagged
their
grey
heads
with
all
the
glee
of
past
experience
and
listening
youth
longed
for
the
time
when
it
might
do
likewise
society
was
the
common
foe
and
magistrates
gaolers
and
parsons
were
the
natural
prey
of
all
noteworthy
mankind
only
fools
were
honest
only
cowards
kissed
the
rod
and
failed
to
meditate
revenge
on
that
world
of
respectability
which
had
wronged
them
each
was
one
more
recruit
to
the
ranks
of
ruffianism
and
not
a
man
penned
in
that
reeking
den
of
infamy
but
became
a
sworn
hater
of
law
order
and
what
he
might
have
been
before
mattered
not
he
was
now
a
prisoner
and
thrust
into
a
suffocating
barracoon
herded
with
the
foulest
of
mankind
with
all
imaginable
depths
of
blasphemy
and
indecency
sounded
hourly
in
his
sight
and
hearing
he
lost
his
and
became
what
his
gaolers
took
him
to
be
a
wild
beast
to
be
locked
under
bolts
and
bars
lest
he
should
break
out
and
tear
them
the
conversation
ran
upon
the
sudden
departure
of
the
four
what
could
they
want
with
them
at
that
hour
i
tell
you
there
something
up
on
deck
says
one
to
the
group
nearest
him
do
you
hear
all
that
rumbling
and
rolling
what
did
they
lower
boats
for
i
heard
the
dip
o
the
do

hazarded
a
short
stout
fellow
as
a
sort
of
happy
suggestion
one
of
those
coves
in
the
parlour
said
another
and
a
laugh
followed
the
speech
no
such
luck
you
wo
hang
your
jib
for
them
yet
awhile
more
like

says
a
fifth
alluding
to
an
old
fellow
who
a
returned
convict
was
again
under
sentence
for
ay
put
in
a
young
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
smartest
crow
the
man
of
a
burglars
gang
in
london
of
men
as
the
parson
the
snuffling
imitation
of
a
methodist
preacher
was
good
and
there
was
another
laugh
just
then
a
miserable
little
cockney
pickpocket
feeling
his
way
to
the
door
fell
into
the
party
a
volley
of
oaths
and
kicks
received
him
i
beg
your
pardon
cries
the
miserable
wretch
but
i
want
go
to
the
barber
and
buy
a
wig
then
says
the
crow
elated
at
the
success
of
his
last
sally
oh
sir

back

up
groaned
someone
in
the
darkness
oh
lord

the
little
cockney

drop
o
vater
for

a
gallon
a
day

says
a
sailor
next
him
yes

asked
the
crow
derisively
someone
stole

said
the
sufferer

squealed
someone
been
an
blued
it
to
buy
a
sunday
veskit
with
oh
ai
he
a
vicked
young
man
and
the
speaker
hid
his
head
under
the
blankets
in
humorous
affectation
of
modesty
all
this
time
the
miserable
little
cockney
he
was
a
tailor
by
trade
had
been
grovelling
under
the
feet
of
the
crow
and
his
companions
let
me
gents
he
implored
let
me
i
feel
as
if
i
should
die
i
let
the
gentleman
up
says
the
humorist
in
the
bunk
do
yer
see
his
kerridge
is
avaitin
to
take
him
to
the
hopera
the
conversation
had
got
a
little
loud
and
from
the
topmost
bunk
on
the
near
side
a
bullet
head
protruded
ai
a
cove
to
get
no
sleep
cried
a
gruff
voice
my
blood
if
i
have
to
turn
out
i
knock
some
of
your
empty
heads
it
seemed
that
the
speaker
was
a
man
of
mark
for
the
noise
ceased
instantly
and
in
the
lull
which
ensued
a
shrill
scream
broke
from
the
wretched
tailor
help
they
killing
me
wot
the
matter
roared
the
silencer
of
the
riot
jumping
from
his
berth
and
scattering
the
crow
and
his
companions
right
and
left
let
him
be
ca
yer
cried
the
poor
devil
i
fainting
just
then
there
came
another
groan
from
the
man
in
the
opposite
bunk
well
i
blessed
said
the
giant
as
he
held
the
gasping
tailor
by
the
collar
and
glared
round
him
here
a
pretty
go
all
the
blessed
chickens
ha
got
the
croup
the
groaning
of
the
man
in
the
bunk
redoubled
pass
the
word
to
the
sentry
says
someone
more
humane
than
the
rest
ah
says
the
humorist
pass
him
out
it
be
one
the
less
rather
have
his
room
than
his
sentry
here
a
man
but
the
sentry
knew
his
duty
better
than
to
reply
he
was
a
young
soldier
but
he
had
been
well
informed
of
the
artfulness
of
convict
stratagems
and
moreover
captain
vickers
had
carefully
apprised
him
that
by
the
king
regulations
he
was
forbidden
to
reply
to
any
question
or
communication
addressed
to
him
by
a
convict
but
in
the
event
of
being
addressed
was
to
call
the
officer
on
now
though
he
was
within
easy
hailing
distance
of
the
guard
on
the
he
felt
a
natural
disinclination
to
disturb
those
gentlemen
merely
for
the
sake
of
a
sick
convict
and
knowing
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
third
relief
would
come
on
duty
he
decided
to
wait
until
then
in
the
meantime
the
tailor
grew
worse
and
began
to
moan
dismally
here
called
out
his
supporter
in
dismay
hold
up
wrong
with
yer
do
come
the
drops
pass
him
down
some
of
yer
and
the
wretch
was
hustled
down
to
the
doorway
vater
he
whispered
beating
feebly
with
his
hand
on
the
thick
oak
get
us
a
drink
mister
for
gord
sake
but
the
prudent
sentry
answered
never
a
word
until
the
ship
bell
warned
him
of
the
approach
of
the
relief
guard
and
then
honest
old
pine
coming
with
anxious
face
to
inquire
after
his
charge
received
the
intelligence
that
there
was
another
prisoner
sick
he
had
the
door
unlocked
and
the
tailor
outside
in
an
instant
one
look
at
the
flushed
anxious
face
was
enough
who
that
moaning
in
there
he
asked
it
was
the
man
who
had
tried
to
call
for
the
sentry
an
hour
back
and
pine
had
him
out
also
convictism
beginning
to
wonder
a
little
take
both
aft
to
the
hospital
he
said
and
jenkins
if
there
are
any
more
men
taken
sick
let
them
pass
the
word
for
me
at
once
i
shall
be
on
the
guard
stared
in
each
other
faces
with
some
alarm
but
said
nothing
thinking
more
of
the
burning
ship
which
now
flamed
furiously
across
the
placid
water
than
of
peril
nearer
home
but
as
pine
went
up
the
hatchway
he
met
blunt
we
got
the
fever
aboard
good
god
do
you
mean
it
pine
pine
shook
his
grizzled
head
sorrowfully
it
this
cursed
calm
that
done
it
though
i
expected
it
all
along
with
the
ship
crammed
as
she
is
when
i
was
in
the
hecuba
who
is
it
pine
laughed
a
laugh
a
convict
of
course
who
else
should
it
be
they
are
reeking
like
bullocks
at
smithfield
down
there
a
hundred
and
eighty
men
penned
into
a
place
fifty
feet
long
with
the
air
like
an
oven
what
could
you
expect
poor
blunt
stamped
his
foot
it
is
my
fault
he
cried
the
soldiers
are
berthed
aft
if
the
government
will
overload
these
ships
i
ca
help
the
government
ah
the
government
the
government
do
sleep
sixty
men
in
a
cabin
only
six
feet
high
the
government
do
get
typhus
fever
in
the
tropics
does
it
no
but
but
what
does
the
government
care
then
blunt
wiped
his
hot
forehead
who
was
the
first
down
no
berth
ten
on
the
lower
tier
john
rex
he
calls
are
you
sure
it
the
fever
as
sure
as
i
can
be
yet
head
like
a
and
tongue
like
a
strip
of
leather
gad
do
i
know
it
and
pine
grinned
mournfully
got
him
moved
into
the
hospital
hospital
it
is
a
hospital
as
dark
as
a
wolf
mouth
i
seen
dog
kennels
i
liked
blunt
nodded
towards
the
volume
of
lurid
smoke
that
rolled
up
out
of
the
suppose
there
is
a
shipload
of
those
poor
devils
i
ca
refuse
to
take
no
says
pine
gloomily
i
suppose
you
ca
if
they
come
i
must
stow
somewhere
we
have
to
run
for
the
cape
with
the
first
breeze
if
they
do
come
that
is
all
i
can
see
for
it
and
he
turned
away
to
watch
the
burning
vessel
chapter
vi
the
fate
of
the
hydaspes
in
the
meanwhile
the
two
boats
made
straight
for
the
red
column
that
uprose
like
a
gigantic
torch
over
the
silent
sea
as
blunt
had
said
the
burning
ship
lay
a
good
twelve
miles
from
the
malabar
and
the
pull
was
a
long
and
a
weary
one
once
fairly
away
from
the
protecting
sides
of
the
vessel
that
had
borne
them
thus
far
on
their
dismal
journey
the
adventurers
seemed
to
have
come
into
a
new
atmosphere
the
immensity
of
the
ocean
over
which
they
slowly
moved
revealed
itself
for
the
first
time
on
board
the
prison
ship
surrounded
with
all
the
memories
if
not
with
the
comforts
of
the
shore
they
had
quitted
they
had
not
realized
how
far
they
were
from
that
civilization
which
had
given
them
birth
the
cuddy
the
homely
mirth
of
the
forecastle
the
setting
of
sentries
and
the
changing
of
guards
even
the
gloom
and
terror
of
the
prison
combined
to
make
the
voyagers
feel
secure
against
the
unknown
dangers
of
the
sea
that
defiance
of
nature
which
is
born
of
contact
with
humanity
had
hitherto
sustained
them
and
they
felt
that
though
alone
on
the
vast
expanse
of
waters
they
were
in
companionship
with
others
of
their
kind
and
that
the
perils
one
man
had
passed
might
be
successfully
dared
by
another
but
now
with
one
ship
growing
smaller
behind
them
and
the
other
containing
they
knew
not
what
horror
of
human
agony
and
human
helplessness
lying
a
burning
wreck
in
the
black
distance
ahead
of
them
they
began
to
feel
their
own
littleness
the
malabar
that
huge
sea
monster
in
whose
capacious
belly
so
many
human
creatures
lived
and
suffered
had
dwindled
to
a
and
yet
beside
her
bulk
how
infinitely
small
had
their
own
frail
cockboat
appeared
as
they
shot
out
from
under
her
towering
stern
then
the
black
hull
rising
above
them
had
seemed
a
tower
of
strength
built
to
defy
the
utmost
violence
of
wind
and
wave
now
it
was
but
a
slip
of
wood
floating
on
an
unknown
depth
of
black
fathomless
water
the
blue
light
which
at
its
first
flashing
over
the
ocean
had
made
the
very
stars
pale
their
lustre
and
lighted
up
with
ghastly
radiance
the
enormous
vault
of
heaven
was
now
only
a
point
brilliant
and
distinct
it
is
true
but
which
by
its
very
brilliance
dwarfed
the
ship
into
insignificance
the
malabar
lay
on
the
water
like
a
on
a
floating
leaf
and
the
glare
of
the
made
no
more
impression
on
the
darkness
than
the
candle
carried
by
a
solitary
miner
would
have
made
on
the
abyss
of
a
and
yet
the
malabar
held
two
hundred
creatures
like
themselves
the
water
over
which
the
boats
glided
was
black
and
smooth
rising
into
huge
foamless
billows
the
more
terrible
because
they
were
silent
when
the
sea
hisses
it
speaks
and
speech
breaks
the
spell
of
terror
when
it
is
inert
heaving
noiselessly
it
is
dumb
and
seems
to
brood
over
mischief
the
ocean
in
a
calm
is
like
a
sulky
giant
one
dreads
that
it
may
be
meditating
evil
moreover
an
angry
sea
looks
less
vast
in
extent
than
a
calm
one
its
mounting
waves
bring
the
horizon
nearer
and
one
does
not
discern
how
for
many
leagues
the
pitiless
billows
repeat
themselves
to
appreciate
the
hideous
vastness
of
the
ocean
one
must
see
it
when
it
sleeps
the
great
sky
uprose
from
this
silent
sea
without
a
cloud
the
stars
hung
low
in
its
expanse
burning
in
a
violent
mist
of
lower
ether
the
heavens
were
emptied
of
sound
and
each
dip
of
the
oars
was
in
space
by
a
succession
of
subtle
harmonies
as
the
blades
struck
the
dark
water
it
flashed
fire
and
the
tracks
of
the
boats
resembled
two
writhing
with
silent
undulations
through
a
lake
of
quicksilver
it
had
been
a
sort
of
race
hitherto
and
the
rowers
with
set
teeth
and
compressed
lips
had
pulled
stroke
for
stroke
at
last
the
foremost
boat
came
to
a
sudden
pause
best
gave
a
cheery
shout
and
passed
her
steering
straight
into
the
broad
track
of
crimson
that
already
reeked
on
the
sea
ahead
what
is
it
he
cried
but
he
heard
only
a
smothered
curse
from
frere
and
then
his
consort
pulled
hard
to
overtake
him
it
was
in
fact
nothing
of
consequence
only
a
prisoner
giving
in
curse
it
says
frere
what
the
matter
with
you
oh
you
is
it
dawes
of
course
dawes
i
never
expected
anything
better
from
such
a
skulking
hound
come
this
sort
of
nonsense
wo
do
with
me
it
as
nice
as
lolloping
about
the
hatchways
i
dare
say
but
you
have
to
go
on
my
fine
he
seems
sick
sir
said
with
compassionate
bow
sick
not
he
shamming
come
give
way
now
put
your
backs
into
it
and
the
convict
having
picked
up
his
oar
the
boat
shot
forward
again
but
for
all
frere
urging
he
could
not
recover
the
way
he
had
lost
and
best
was
the
first
to
run
in
under
the
black
cloud
that
hung
over
the
crimsoned
water
at
his
signal
the
second
boat
came
alongside
keep
wide
he
said
if
there
are
many
fellows
yet
aboard
swamp
us
and
i
think
there
must
be
as
we
have
met
the
boats
and
then
raising
his
voice
as
the
exhausted
crew
lay
on
their
oars
he
hailed
the
burning
ship
she
was
a
huge
vessel
with
great
breadth
of
beam
and
a
lofty
strangely
enough
though
they
had
so
lately
seen
the
fire
she
was
already
a
wreck
and
appeared
to
be
completely
deserted
the
chief
hold
of
the
fire
was
amidships
and
the
lower
deck
was
one
mass
of
flame
here
and
there
were
great
charred
rifts
and
gaps
in
her
sides
and
the
fire
glowed
through
these
as
through
the
bars
of
a
grate
the
had
fallen
on
the
starboard
side
and
trailed
a
blackened
wreck
in
the
water
causing
the
unwieldy
vessel
to
lean
over
heavily
the
fire
roared
like
a
cataract
and
huge
volumes
of
smoke
poured
up
out
of
the
hold
and
rolled
away
in
a
black
cloud
over
the
sea
as
frere
boat
pulled
slowly
round
her
stern
he
hailed
the
deck
again
and
again
still
there
was
no
answer
and
though
the
flood
of
light
that
dyed
the
water
struck
out
every
rope
and
spar
distinct
and
clear
his
straining
eyes
could
see
no
living
soul
aboard
as
they
came
nearer
they
could
distinguish
the
gilded
letters
of
her
name
what
is
it
men
cried
frere
his
voice
almost
drowned
amid
the
roar
of
the
flames
can
you
see
rufus
dawes
impelled
it
would
seem
by
some
strong
impulse
of
curiosity
stood
erect
and
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
well
ca
you
speak
what
is
it
the
hydaspes
frere
gasped
the
hydaspes
the
ship
in
which
his
cousin
richard
devine
had
sailed
the
ship
for
which
those
in
england
might
now
look
in
vain
the
hydaspes
which
something
he
had
heard
during
the
speculations
as
to
this
missing
cousin
flashed
across
him
back
water
men
round
with
her
pull
for
your
lives
best
boat
glided
alongside
can
you
see
her
name
frere
white
with
terror
shouted
a
reply
the
hydaspes
i
know
her
she
is
bound
for
calcutta
and
she
has
five
tons
of
powder
aboard
there
was
no
need
for
more
words
the
single
sentence
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
her
desertion
the
crew
had
taken
to
the
boats
on
the
first
alarm
and
had
left
their
vessel
to
her
fate
they
were
miles
off
by
this
time
and
unluckily
for
themselves
perhaps
had
steered
away
from
the
side
where
rescue
lay
the
boats
tore
through
the
water
eager
as
the
men
had
been
to
come
they
were
more
eager
to
depart
the
flames
had
even
now
reached
the
poop
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
be
too
late
for
ten
minutes
or
more
not
a
word
was
spoken
with
straining
arms
and
labouring
chests
the
rowers
tugged
at
the
oars
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
lurid
mass
they
were
leaving
frere
and
best
with
their
faces
turned
back
to
the
terror
they
fled
from
urged
the
men
to
greater
efforts
already
the
flames
had
lapped
the
flag
already
the
outlines
of
the
stern
carvings
were
blurred
by
the
fire
another
moment
and
all
would
be
over
ah
it
had
come
at
last
a
dull
rumbling
sound
the
burning
ship
parted
asunder
a
pillar
of
fire
flecked
with
black
masses
that
were
beams
and
planks
rose
up
out
of
the
ocean
there
was
a
terrific
crash
as
though
sea
and
sky
were
coming
together
and
then
a
mighty
mountain
of
water
rose
advanced
caught
and
passed
them
and
they
were
alone
deafened
stunned
and
breathless
in
a
sudden
horror
of
thickest
darkness
and
a
silence
like
that
of
the
tomb
the
splashing
of
the
falling
fragments
awoke
them
from
their
stupor
and
then
the
blue
light
of
the
malabar
struck
out
a
bright
pathway
across
the
sea
and
they
knew
that
they
were
safe
on
board
the
malabar
two
men
paced
the
deck
waiting
for
dawn
it
came
at
last
the
sky
lightened
the
mist
melted
away
and
then
a
long
low
streak
of
pale
yellow
light
floated
on
the
eastern
horizon
by
and
by
the
water
sparkled
and
the
sea
changed
colour
turning
from
black
to
yellow
and
from
yellow
to
lucid
green
the
man
at
the
masthead
hailed
the
deck
the
boats
were
in
sight
and
as
they
came
towards
the
ship
the
bright
water
flashing
from
the
labouring
oars
a
crowd
of
spectators
hanging
over
the
bulwarks
cheered
and
waved
their
hats
not
a
soul
cried
blunt
no
one
but
themselves
well
i
glad
they
safe
the
boats
drew
alongside
and
in
a
few
seconds
frere
was
upon
deck
well
frere
no
use
cried
frere
shivering
we
only
just
had
time
to
get
away
the
nearest
thing
in
the
world
did
you
see
anyone
not
a
soul
they
must
have
taken
to
the
then
they
ca
be
far
off
cried
blunt
sweeping
the
horizon
with
his
glass
they
must
have
pulled
all
the
way
for
there
has
been
enough
wind
to
fill
a
hollow
tooth
perhaps
they
pulled
in
the
wrong
direction
said
frere
they
had
a
good
four
hours
start
of
us
you
then
best
came
up
and
told
the
story
to
a
crowd
of
eager
listeners
the
sailors
having
hoisted
and
secured
the
boats
were
hurried
off
to
the
forecastle
there
to
eat
and
relate
their
experience
between
mouthfuls
and
the
four
convicts
were
taken
in
charge
and
locked
below
again
you
had
better
go
and
turn
in
frere
said
pine
gruffly
it
no
use
whistling
for
a
wind
here
all
frere
laughed
in
his
heartiest
manner
i
think
i
will
he
said
dog
tired
and
as
sleepy
as
an
owl
and
he
descended
the
poop
ladder
pine
took
a
couple
of
turns
up
and
down
the
deck
and
then
catching
blunt
eye
stopped
in
front
of
vickers
you
may
think
it
a
hard
thing
to
say
captain
vickers
but
it
just
as
well
if
we
do
find
these
poor
devils
we
have
quite
enough
on
our
hands
as
it
what
do
you
mean
pine
says
vickers
his
humane
feelings
getting
the
better
of
his
pomposity
you
would
not
surely
leave
the
unhappy
men
to
their
perhaps
returned
the
other
they
would
not
thank
us
for
taking
them
i
do
understand
the
fever
has
broken
vickers
raised
his
brows
he
had
no
experience
of
such
things
and
though
the
intelligence
was
startling
the
crowded
condition
of
the
prison
rendered
it
easy
to
be
understood
and
he
apprehended
no
danger
to
himself
it
is
a
great
misfortune
but
of
course
you
will
take
such
steps
it
is
only
in
the
prison
as
yet
says
pine
with
a
grim
emphasis
on
the
word
but
there
is
no
saying
how
long
it
may
stop
there
i
have
got
three
men
down
as
it
well
sir
all
authority
in
the
matter
is
in
your
hands
any
suggestions
you
make
i
will
of
course
do
my
best
to
carry
thank
ye
i
must
have
more
room
in
the
hospital
to
begin
with
the
soldiers
must
lie
a
little
i
will
see
what
can
be
and
you
had
better
keep
your
wife
and
the
little
girl
as
much
on
deck
as
vickers
turned
pale
at
the
mention
of
his
child
good
heaven
do
you
think
there
is
any
danger
there
is
of
course
danger
to
all
of
us
but
with
care
we
may
escape
it
there
that
maid
too
tell
her
to
keep
to
herself
a
little
more
she
has
a
trick
of
roaming
about
the
ship
i
do
like
infection
is
easily
spread
and
children
always
sicken
sooner
than
vickers
pressed
his
lips
together
this
old
man
with
his
harsh
dissonant
voice
and
hideous
practicality
seemed
like
a
bird
of
ill
omen
blunt
hitherto
silently
listening
put
in
a
word
for
defence
of
the
absent
woman
the
wench
is
right
enough
pine
said
he
what
the
matter
with
her
yes
she
all
right
i
no
doubt
she
less
likely
to
take
it
than
any
of
us
you
can
see
her
vitality
in
her
face
as
many
lives
as
a
cat
but
she
bring
infection
quicker
than
i
i
go
at
once
cried
poor
vickers
turning
round
the
woman
of
whom
they
were
speaking
met
him
on
the
ladder
her
face
was
paler
than
usual
and
dark
circles
round
her
eyes
gave
evidence
of
a
sleepless
night
she
opened
her
red
lips
to
speak
and
then
seeing
vickers
stopped
abruptly
well
what
is
it
she
looked
from
one
to
the
other
i
came
for
vickers
with
the
quick
intelligence
of
affection
guessed
her
errand
someone
is
ill
miss
sylvia
sir
it
is
nothing
to
signify
i
think
a
little
feverish
and
hot
and
my
mistress
vickers
was
down
the
ladder
in
an
instant
with
scared
face
pine
caught
the
girl
round
firm
arm
where
have
you
been
two
great
flakes
of
red
came
out
in
her
white
cheeks
and
she
shot
an
indignant
glance
at
blunt
come
pine
let
the
wench
alone
were
you
with
the
child
last
night
went
on
pine
without
turning
his
head
no
i
have
not
been
in
the
cabin
since
dinner
yesterday
vickers
only
called
me
in
just
now
let
go
my
arm
sir
you
hurt
pine
loosed
his
hold
as
if
satisfied
at
the
reply
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
gruffly
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
but
the
fever
has
broken
out
in
the
prison
and
i
think
the
child
has
caught
it
you
must
be
careful
where
you
and
then
with
an
anxious
face
he
went
in
pursuit
of
vickers
sarah
purfoy
stood
motionless
for
an
instant
in
deadly
terror
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
glittered
and
she
made
a
movement
as
though
to
retrace
her
steps
poor
soul
thought
honest
blunt
how
she
feels
for
the
child
d
that
lubberly
surgeon
he
hurt
her
never
mind
my
lass
he
said
aloud
it
was
broad
daylight
and
he
had
not
as
much
courage
in
as
at
night
do
be
afraid
i
been
in
ships
with
fever
before
awaking
as
it
were
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
came
closer
to
him
but
ship
fever
i
have
heard
of
it
men
have
died
like
rotten
sheep
in
crowded
vessels
like
tush
not
they
do
be
frightened
miss
sylvia
wo
die
nor
you
he
took
her
hand
it
may
knock
off
a
few
dozen
prisoners
or
so
they
are
pretty
close
packed
down
there
she
drew
her
hand
away
and
then
remembering
herself
gave
it
him
again
what
is
the
matter
nothing
a
pain
i
did
not
sleep
last
there
there
you
are
upset
i
dare
say
go
and
lie
she
was
staring
away
past
him
over
the
sea
as
if
in
thought
so
intently
did
she
look
that
he
involuntarily
turned
his
head
and
the
action
recalled
her
to
herself
she
brought
her
fine
straight
brows
together
for
a
moment
and
then
raised
them
with
the
action
of
a
thinker
who
has
decided
on
his
course
of
conduct
i
have
a
toothache
said
she
putting
her
hand
to
her
face
take
some
laudanum
says
blunt
with
dim
recollections
of
his
treatment
of
such
ailments
old
pine
give
you
to
his
astonishment
she
burst
into
tears
there
there
do
cry
my
dear
hang
it
do
cry
what
are
you
crying
about
she
dashed
away
the
bright
drops
and
raised
her
face
with
a
rainy
smile
of
trusting
affection
nothing
i
am
lonely
so
far
from
home
and
and
pine
hurt
my
arm
look
she
bared
that
shapely
member
as
she
spoke
and
sure
enough
there
were
three
red
marks
on
the
white
and
shining
flesh
the
ruffian
cried
blunt
it
too
and
after
a
hasty
look
around
him
the
infatuated
fellow
kissed
the
bruise
i
get
the
laudanum
for
you
he
said
you
sha
ask
that
bear
for
it
come
into
my
blunt
cabin
was
in
the
starboard
side
of
the
ship
just
under
the
poop
awning
and
possessed
three
windows
one
looking
out
over
the
side
and
two
upon
deck
the
corresponding
cabin
on
the
other
side
was
occupied
by
maurice
frere
he
closed
the
door
and
took
down
a
small
medicine
chest
cleated
above
the
hooks
where
hung
his
telescope
here
said
he
opening
it
i
carried
this
little
box
for
years
but
it
ai
often
i
want
to
use
it
thank
god
now
then
put
some
this
into
your
mouth
and
hold
it
good
gracious
captain
blunt
you
poison
me
give
me
the
bottle
i
help
do
take
too
much
says
blunt
it
dangerous
stuff
you
you
need
not
fear
i
used
it
the
door
was
shut
and
as
she
put
the
bottle
in
her
pocket
the
amorous
captain
caught
her
in
his
arms
what
do
you
say
come
i
think
i
deserve
a
kiss
for
her
tears
were
all
dry
long
ago
and
had
only
given
increased
colour
to
her
face
this
agreeable
woman
never
wept
long
enough
to
make
herself
distasteful
she
raised
her
dark
eyes
to
his
for
a
moment
with
a
saucy
smile
by
and
by
said
she
and
escaping
gained
her
cabin
it
was
next
to
that
of
her
mistress
and
she
could
hear
the
sick
child
feebly
moaning
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
real
ones
this
time
poor
little
thing
she
said
i
hope
she
wo
and
then
she
threw
herself
on
her
bed
and
buried
her
hot
head
in
the
pillow
the
intelligence
of
the
fever
seemed
to
have
terrified
her
had
the
news
disarranged
some
plan
of
hers
being
near
the
accomplishment
of
some
cherished
scheme
long
kept
in
view
had
the
sudden
and
unexpected
presence
of
disease
falsified
her
calculations
and
cast
an
almost
insurmountable
obstacle
in
her
path
she
die
and
through
me
how
did
i
know
that
he
had
the
fever
perhaps
i
have
taken
it
myself
i
feel
she
turned
over
on
the
bed
as
if
in
pain
and
then
started
to
a
sitting
position
stung
by
a
sudden
thought
perhaps
he
might
die
the
fever
spreads
quickly
and
if
so
all
this
plotting
will
have
been
useless
it
must
be
done
at
once
it
will
never
do
to
break
down
now
and
taking
the
phial
from
her
pocket
she
held
it
up
to
see
how
much
it
contained
it
was
three
parts
full
enough
for
both
she
said
between
her
set
teeth
the
action
of
holding
up
the
bottle
reminded
her
of
the
amorous
blunt
and
she
smiled
a
strange
way
to
show
affection
for
a
man
she
said
to
herself
and
yet
he
does
care
and
i
suppose
i
should
by
this
time
i
go
through
with
it
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
can
fall
back
on
she
loosened
the
cork
of
the
phial
so
that
it
would
come
out
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
then
placed
it
carefully
in
her
bosom
i
will
get
a
little
sleep
if
i
can
she
said
they
have
got
the
note
and
it
shall
be
done
chapter
vii
typhus
fever
the
felon
rufus
dawes
had
stretched
himself
in
his
bunk
and
tried
to
sleep
but
though
he
was
tired
and
sore
and
his
head
felt
like
lead
he
could
not
but
keep
broad
awake
the
long
pull
through
the
pure
air
if
it
had
tired
him
had
revived
him
and
he
felt
stronger
but
for
all
that
the
fatal
sickness
that
was
on
him
maintained
its
hold
his
pulse
beat
thickly
and
his
brain
throbbed
with
unnatural
heat
lying
in
his
narrow
space
in
the
he
tossed
his
limbs
about
and
closed
his
eyes
in
vain
he
could
not
sleep
his
utmost
efforts
induced
only
an
oppressive
stagnation
of
thought
through
which
he
heard
the
voices
of
his
while
before
his
eyes
was
still
the
burning
hydaspes
that
vessel
whose
destruction
had
destroyed
for
ever
all
trace
of
the
unhappy
richard
devine
it
was
fortunate
for
his
comfort
perhaps
that
the
man
who
had
been
chosen
to
accompany
him
was
of
a
talkative
turn
for
the
prisoners
insisted
upon
hearing
the
story
of
the
explosion
a
dozen
times
over
and
rufus
dawes
himself
had
been
roused
to
give
the
name
of
the
vessel
with
his
own
lips
had
it
not
been
for
the
hideous
respect
in
which
he
was
held
it
is
possible
that
he
might
have
been
compelled
to
give
his
version
also
and
to
join
in
the
animated
discussion
which
took
place
upon
the
possibility
of
the
saving
of
the
fugitive
crew
as
it
was
however
he
was
left
in
peace
and
lay
unnoticed
trying
to
sleep
the
detachment
of
fifty
being
on
deck
airing
the
prison
was
not
quite
so
hot
as
at
night
and
many
of
the
convicts
made
up
for
their
lack
of
rest
by
snatching
a
in
the
bared
bunks
the
four
volunteer
oarsmen
were
allowed
to
take
it
as
yet
there
had
been
no
alarm
of
fever
the
three
seizures
had
excited
some
comment
however
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
of
the
burning
ship
it
is
possible
that
pine
precaution
would
have
been
thrown
away
the
old
hands
who
had
been
through
the
passage
before
suspected
but
said
nothing
save
among
themselves
it
was
likely
that
the
weak
and
sickly
would
go
first
and
that
there
would
be
more
room
for
those
remaining
the
old
hands
were
satisfied
three
of
these
old
hands
were
conversing
together
just
behind
the
partition
of
dawes
bunk
as
we
have
said
the
berths
were
five
feet
square
and
each
contained
six
men
no
the
berth
occupied
by
dawes
was
situated
on
the
corner
made
by
the
joining
of
the
starboard
and
centre
lines
and
behind
it
was
a
slight
recess
in
which
the
scuttle
was
fixed
his
mates
were
at
present
but
three
in
number
for
john
rex
and
the
cockney
tailor
had
been
removed
to
the
hospital
the
three
that
remained
were
now
in
deep
conversation
in
the
shelter
of
the
recess
of
these
the
giant
who
had
the
previous
night
asserted
his
authority
in
the
prison
seemed
to
be
the
chief
his
name
was
gabbett
he
was
a
returned
convict
now
on
his
way
to
undergo
a
second
sentence
for
burglary
the
other
two
were
a
man
named
sanders
known
as
the
moocher
and
jemmy
vetch
the
crow
they
were
talking
in
whispers
but
rufus
dawes
lying
with
his
head
close
to
the
partition
was
enabled
to
catch
much
of
what
they
said
at
first
the
conversation
turned
on
the
catastrophe
of
the
burning
ship
and
the
likelihood
of
saving
the
crew
from
this
it
grew
to
anecdote
of
wreck
and
adventure
and
at
last
gabbett
said
something
which
made
the
listener
start
from
his
indifferent
efforts
to
slumber
into
sudden
broad
wakefulness
it
was
the
mention
of
his
own
name
coupled
with
that
of
the
woman
he
had
met
on
the
that
roused
him
i
saw
her
speaking
to
dawes
yesterday
said
the
giant
with
an
oath
we
do
want
no
more
than
we
got
i
ai
goin
to
risk
my
neck
for
rex
woman
fancies
and
so
i
tell
it
was
something
about
the
kid
says
the
crow
in
his
elegant
slang
i
do
believe
she
ever
saw
him
before
besides
she
nuts
on
jack
and
ai
likely
to
pick
up
with
another
if
i
thort
she
was
agoin
to
throw
us
over
i
cut
her
throat
as
soon
as
look
at
her
snorts
gabbett
savagely
jack
ud
have
a
word
in
that
snuffles
the
moocher
and
he
a
curious
cove
to
quarrel
well
stow
yer
gaff
grumbled
gabbett
and
let
have
no
more
chaff
if
we
for
bizness
let
come
to
what
are
we
to
do
now
asked
the
moocher
jack
on
the
sick
list
and
the
gal
wo
stir
ay
returned
gabbett
that
my
dear
friends
said
the
crow
my
keyind
and
keristian
friends
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
when
natur
gave
you
such
tremendously
thick
skulls
she
did
put
something
inside
of
i
say
that
now
the
time
jack
in
the
what
of
that
that
do
make
it
no
better
for
him
does
it
not
a
bit
of
it
and
if
he
drops
his
knife
and
fork
why
then
it
my
opinion
that
the
gal
wo
stir
a
peg
it
on
his
account
not
ours
that
she
been
manoovering
ai
it
well
says
gabbett
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
but
partly
convinced
i
it
all
the
more
reason
of
getting
it
off
quick
another
thing
when
the
boys
know
there
fever
aboard
you
see
the
rumpus
there
be
they
be
ready
enough
to
join
us
then
once
get
the
snapper
chest
and
we
right
as
o
this
conversation
interspersed
with
oaths
and
slang
as
it
was
had
an
intense
interest
for
rufus
dawes
plunged
into
prison
hurriedly
tried
and
by
reason
of
his
surroundings
ignorant
of
the
death
of
his
father
and
his
own
fortune
he
had
hitherto
in
his
agony
and
sullen
gloom
held
aloof
from
the
scoundrels
who
surrounded
him
and
repelled
their
hideous
advances
of
friendship
he
now
saw
his
error
he
knew
that
the
name
he
had
once
possessed
was
blotted
out
that
any
shred
of
his
old
life
which
had
clung
to
him
hitherto
was
shrivelled
in
the
fire
that
consumed
the
hydaspes
the
secret
for
the
preservation
of
which
richard
devine
had
voluntarily
flung
away
his
name
and
risked
a
terrible
and
disgraceful
death
would
be
now
for
ever
safe
for
richard
devine
was
dead
lost
at
sea
with
the
crew
of
the
vessel
in
which
deluded
by
a
letter
from
the
prison
his
mother
believed
him
to
have
sailed
richard
devine
was
dead
and
the
secret
of
his
birth
would
die
with
him
rufus
dawes
his
alter
ego
alone
should
live
rufus
dawes
the
convicted
felon
the
suspected
murderer
should
live
to
claim
his
freedom
and
work
out
his
vengeance
or
rendered
powerful
by
the
terrible
experience
of
the
should
seize
both
in
defiance
of
gaol
or
gaoler
with
his
head
swimming
and
his
brain
on
fire
he
eagerly
listened
for
more
it
seemed
as
if
the
fever
which
burnt
in
his
veins
had
consumed
the
grosser
part
of
his
sense
and
given
him
increased
power
of
hearing
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
his
bones
ached
his
hands
burned
his
head
throbbed
but
he
could
hear
distinctly
and
he
thought
reason
on
what
he
heard
profoundly
but
we
ca
stir
without
the
girl
gabbett
said
she
got
to
stall
off
the
sentry
and
give
us
the
the
crow
sallow
features
lighted
up
with
a
cunning
smile
dear
old
caper
merchant
hear
him
talk
said
he
as
if
he
had
the
wisdom
of
solomon
in
all
his
glory
look
here
and
he
produced
a
dirty
scrap
of
paper
over
which
his
companions
eagerly
bent
their
heads
where
did
yer
get
that
yesterday
afternoon
sarah
was
standing
on
the
poop
throwing
bits
toke
to
the
gulls
and
i
saw
her
at
me
very
hard
at
last
she
came
down
as
near
the
barricade
as
she
dared
and
throwed
crumbs
and
such
like
up
in
the
air
over
the
side
by
and
by
a
pretty
big
lump
doughed
up
round
fell
close
to
my
foot
and
watching
a
favourable
opportunity
i
pouched
it
inside
was
this
bit
o
ah
said
gabbett
that
more
like
read
it
out
the
writing
though
feminine
in
character
was
bold
and
distinct
sarah
had
evidently
been
mindful
of
the
education
of
her
friends
and
had
desired
to
give
them
as
little
trouble
as
possible
all
is
right
watch
me
when
i
come
up
evening
at
three
bells
if
i
drop
my
handkerchief
get
to
work
at
the
time
agreed
on
the
sentry
will
be
rufus
dawes
though
his
eyelids
would
scarcely
keep
open
and
a
terrible
lassitude
almost
paralysed
his
limbs
eagerly
drank
in
the
whispered
sentence
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
ship
sarah
purfoy
was
in
league
with
the
convicts
was
herself
the
wife
or
mistress
of
one
of
them
she
had
come
on
board
armed
with
a
plot
for
his
release
and
this
plot
was
about
to
be
put
in
execution
he
had
heard
of
the
atrocities
perpetrated
by
successful
mutineers
story
after
story
of
such
nature
had
often
made
the
prison
resound
with
horrible
mirth
he
knew
the
characters
of
the
three
ruffians
who
separated
from
him
by
but
two
inches
of
planking
jested
and
laughed
over
their
plans
of
freedom
and
vengeance
though
he
conversed
but
little
with
his
companions
these
men
were
his
berth
mates
and
he
could
not
but
know
how
they
would
proceed
to
wreak
their
vengeance
on
their
gaolers
true
that
the
head
of
this
formidable
chimera
john
rex
the
forger
was
absent
but
the
two
hands
or
rather
claws
the
burglar
and
the
were
present
and
the
effeminate
crow
if
he
had
not
the
brains
of
the
master
yet
made
up
for
his
flaccid
muscles
and
nerveless
frame
by
a
cunning
and
a
spirit
of
devilish
volatility
that
nothing
could
subdue
with
such
a
powerful
ally
outside
as
the
mock
the
chance
of
success
was
enormously
increased
there
were
one
hundred
and
eighty
convicts
and
but
fifty
soldiers
if
the
first
rush
proved
successful
and
the
precautions
taken
by
sarah
purfoy
rendered
success
possible
the
vessel
was
theirs
rufus
dawes
thought
of
the
little
child
who
had
run
so
confidingly
to
meet
him
and
shuddered
there
said
the
crow
with
a
sneering
laugh
what
do
you
think
of
that
does
the
girl
look
like
nosing
us
now
no
says
the
giant
stretching
his
great
arms
with
a
grin
of
delight
as
one
stretches
one
chest
in
the
sun
that
right
that
is
more
like
england
home
and
beauty
said
vetch
with
a
air
strangely
out
of
tune
with
the
subject
under
discussion
you
like
to
go
home
again
would
you
old
man
gabbett
turned
on
him
fiercely
his
low
forehead
wrinkled
into
a
frown
of
ferocious
recollection
you
he
said
you
think
the
chain
fine
sport
do
yer
but
been
there
my
young
chicken
and
i
knows
what
it
there
was
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
the
giant
was
plunged
in
gloomy
abstraction
and
vetch
and
the
moocher
interchanged
a
significant
glance
gabbett
had
been
ten
years
at
the
colonial
penal
settlement
of
macquarie
harbour
and
he
had
memories
that
he
did
not
confide
to
his
companions
when
he
indulged
in
one
of
these
fits
of
recollection
his
friends
found
it
best
to
leave
him
to
himself
rufus
dawes
did
not
understand
the
sudden
silence
with
all
his
senses
stretched
to
the
utmost
to
listen
the
cessation
of
the
whispered
colloquy
affected
him
strangely
old
have
said
that
after
being
at
work
for
days
in
the
trenches
accustomed
to
the
continued
roar
of
the
guns
a
sudden
pause
in
the
firing
will
cause
them
intense
pain
something
of
this
feeling
was
experienced
by
rufus
dawes
his
faculties
of
hearing
and
thinking
both
at
their
highest
pitch
seemed
to
break
down
it
was
as
though
some
prop
had
been
knocked
from
under
him
no
longer
stimulated
by
outward
sounds
his
senses
appeared
to
fail
him
the
blood
rushed
into
his
eyes
and
ears
he
made
a
violent
vain
effort
to
retain
his
consciousness
but
with
a
faint
cry
fell
back
striking
his
head
against
the
edge
of
the
bunk
the
noise
roused
the
burglar
in
an
instant
there
was
someone
in
the
berth
the
three
looked
into
each
other
eyes
in
guilty
alarm
and
then
gabbett
dashed
round
the
partition
it
dawes
said
the
moocher
we
had
forgotten
him
he
join
us
mate
he
join
us
cried
vetch
fearful
of
bloodshed
gabbett
uttered
a
furious
oath
and
flinging
himself
on
to
the
prostrate
figure
dragged
it
head
foremost
to
the
floor
the
sudden
vertigo
had
saved
rufus
dawes
life
the
robber
twisted
one
brawny
hand
in
his
shirt
and
pressing
the
knuckles
down
prepared
to
deliver
a
blow
that
should
for
ever
silence
the
listener
when
vetch
caught
his
arm
been
asleep
he
cried
do
hit
him
see
he
not
awake
a
crowd
gathered
round
the
giant
relaxed
his
grip
but
the
convict
gave
only
a
deep
groan
and
allowed
his
head
to
fall
on
his
shoulder
killed
him
cried
someone
gabbett
took
another
look
at
the
purpling
face
and
the
bedewed
forehead
and
then
sprang
erect
rubbing
at
his
right
hand
as
though
he
would
rub
off
something
sticking
there
he
got
the
fever
he
roared
with
a
grimace
the
what
asked
twenty
voices
the
fever
ye
grinning
fools
cried
gabbett
i
seen
it
before
the
typhus
is
aboard
and
he
the
fourth
man
down
the
circle
of
faces
stretched
forward
to
see
the
fight
widened
at
the
word
it
was
as
though
a
bombshell
had
fallen
into
the
group
rufus
dawes
lay
on
the
deck
motionless
breathing
heavily
the
savage
circle
glared
at
his
prostrate
body
the
alarm
ran
round
and
all
the
prison
crowded
down
to
stare
at
him
all
at
once
he
uttered
a
groan
and
turning
propped
his
body
on
his
two
rigid
arms
and
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
no
sound
issued
from
his
convulsed
jaws
he
done
said
the
moocher
brutally
he
did
hear
nuffin
pound
the
noise
of
the
heavy
bolts
shooting
back
broke
the
spell
the
first
detachment
were
coming
down
from
the
door
was
flung
back
and
the
bayonets
of
the
guard
gleamed
in
a
ray
of
sunshine
that
shot
down
the
hatchway
this
glimpse
of
sunlight
sparkling
at
the
entrance
of
the
foetid
and
stifling
prison
seemed
to
mock
their
miseries
it
was
as
though
heaven
laughed
at
them
by
one
of
those
terrible
and
strange
impulses
which
animate
crowds
the
mass
turning
from
the
sick
man
leapt
towards
the
doorway
the
interior
of
the
prison
flashed
white
with
suddenly
turned
faces
the
gloom
scintillated
with
rapidly
moving
hands
air
air
give
us
air
that
it
said
sanders
to
his
companions
i
thought
the
news
would
rouse
gabbett
all
the
savage
in
his
blood
stirred
by
the
sight
of
flashing
eyes
and
wrathful
faces
would
have
thrown
himself
forward
with
the
rest
but
vetch
plucked
him
back
it
be
over
in
a
moment
he
said
it
only
a
fit
they
he
spoke
truly
through
the
uproar
was
heard
the
rattle
of
iron
on
iron
as
the
guard
stood
to
their
arms
and
the
wedge
of
grey
cloth
broke
in
sudden
terror
of
the
levelled
muskets
there
was
an
instant
pause
and
then
old
pine
walked
unmolested
down
the
prison
and
knelt
by
the
body
of
rufus
dawes
the
sight
of
the
familiar
figure
so
calmly
performing
its
familiar
duty
restored
all
that
submission
to
recognized
authority
which
strict
discipline
begets
the
convicts
slunk
away
into
their
berths
or
officiously
ran
to
help
the
doctor
with
affectation
of
intense
obedience
the
prison
was
like
a
schoolroom
into
which
the
master
had
suddenly
returned
stand
back
my
lads
take
him
up
two
of
you
and
carry
him
to
the
door
the
poor
fellow
wo
hurt
his
orders
were
obeyed
and
the
old
man
waiting
until
his
patient
had
been
safely
received
outside
raised
his
hand
to
command
attention
i
see
you
know
what
i
have
to
tell
the
fever
has
broken
out
that
man
has
got
it
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
no
one
else
will
be
seized
i
might
catch
it
myself
you
are
much
crowded
down
here
i
know
but
my
lads
i
help
that
i
did
make
the
ship
you
it
is
a
terrible
thing
but
you
must
keep
orderly
and
quiet
and
bear
it
like
men
you
know
what
the
discipline
is
and
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
alter
it
i
shall
do
my
best
for
your
comfort
and
i
look
to
you
to
help
holding
his
grey
head
very
erect
indeed
the
brave
old
fellow
passed
straight
down
the
line
without
looking
to
the
right
or
left
he
had
said
just
enough
and
he
reached
the
door
amid
a
chorus
of
bravo
true
for
you
docther
and
so
on
but
when
he
got
fairly
outside
he
breathed
more
freely
he
had
performed
a
ticklish
task
and
he
knew
it
at
growled
the
moocher
from
his
corner
at
the
bloody
noos
wait
a
bit
said
the
acuter
intelligence
of
jemmy
vetch
give
time
there
be
three
or
four
more
down
afore
night
and
then
see
chapter
viii
a
dangerous
crisis
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
sarah
purfoy
awoke
from
her
uneasy
slumber
she
had
been
dreaming
of
the
deed
she
was
about
to
do
and
was
flushed
and
feverish
but
mindful
of
the
consequences
which
hung
upon
the
success
or
failure
of
the
enterprise
she
rallied
herself
bathed
her
face
and
hands
and
ascended
with
as
calm
an
air
as
she
could
assume
to
the
nothing
was
changed
since
yesterday
the
sentries
arms
glittered
in
the
pitiless
sunshine
the
ship
rolled
and
creaked
on
the
swell
of
the
dreamy
sea
and
the
on
the
lower
deck
was
crowded
with
the
same
cheerless
figures
disposed
in
the
attitudes
of
the
day
before
even
maurice
frere
recovered
from
his
midnight
fatigues
was
lounging
on
the
same
coil
of
rope
in
precisely
the
same
position
yet
the
eye
of
an
acute
observer
would
have
detected
some
difference
beneath
this
outward
varnish
of
similarity
the
man
at
the
wheel
looked
round
the
horizon
more
eagerly
and
spit
into
the
swirling
water
with
a
more
dejected
air
than
before
the
still
hung
dangling
over
the
catheads
but
nobody
touched
them
the
soldiers
and
sailors
on
the
forecastle
collected
in
knots
had
no
heart
even
to
smoke
but
gloomily
stared
at
each
other
vickers
was
in
the
cuddy
writing
blunt
was
in
his
cabin
and
pine
with
two
carpenters
at
work
under
his
directions
was
improvising
increased
hospital
accommodation
the
noise
of
mallet
and
hammer
echoed
in
the
soldiers
berth
ominously
the
workmen
might
have
been
making
coffins
the
prison
was
strangely
silent
with
the
lowering
silence
which
precedes
a
thunderstorm
and
the
convicts
on
deck
no
longer
told
stories
nor
laughed
at
obscene
jests
but
sat
together
moodily
patient
as
if
waiting
for
something
three
men
two
prisoners
and
a
soldier
had
succumbed
since
rufus
dawes
had
been
removed
to
the
hospital
and
though
as
yet
there
had
been
no
complaint
or
symptom
of
panic
the
face
of
each
man
soldier
sailor
or
prisoner
wore
an
expectant
look
as
though
he
wondered
whose
turn
would
come
next
on
the
ship
rolling
ceaselessly
from
side
to
side
like
some
wounded
creature
on
the
opaque
profundity
of
that
stagnant
ocean
a
horrible
shadow
had
fallen
the
malabar
seemed
to
be
enveloped
in
an
electric
cloud
whose
sullen
gloom
a
chance
spark
might
flash
into
a
blaze
that
should
consume
her
the
woman
who
held
in
her
hands
the
two
ends
of
the
chain
that
would
produce
this
spark
paused
came
up
upon
deck
and
after
a
glance
round
leant
against
the
poop
railing
and
looked
down
into
the
barricade
as
we
have
said
the
prisoners
were
in
knots
of
four
and
five
and
to
one
group
in
particular
her
glance
was
directed
three
men
leaning
carelessly
against
the
bulwarks
watched
her
every
motion
there
she
is
right
enough
growled
gabbett
as
if
in
continuation
of
a
previous
remark
flash
as
ever
and
looking
this
way
i
do
see
no
wipe
said
the
practical
moocher
patience
is
a
virtue
most
noble
knuckler
says
the
crow
with
affected
carelessness
give
the
young
woman
blowed
if
i
going
to
wait
no
longer
says
the
giant
licking
his
coarse
blue
lips
we
been
bluffed
off
day
arter
day
and
dancin
round
the
dandy
wench
like
a
parcel
o
dogs
the
aboard
and
we
got
all
ready
what
the
use
o
waitin
orfice
or
no
orfice
i
for
bizness
at
once
there
look
at
that
he
added
with
an
oath
as
the
figure
of
maurice
frere
appeared
side
by
side
with
that
of
the
and
the
two
turned
away
up
the
deck
together
it
all
right
you
confounded
muddlehead
cried
the
crow
losing
patience
with
his
perverse
and
stupid
companion
how
can
she
give
us
the
office
with
that
cove
at
her
elbow
gabbett
only
reply
to
this
question
was
a
ferocious
grunt
and
a
sudden
elevation
of
his
clenched
fist
which
caused
vetch
to
retreat
precipitately
the
giant
did
not
follow
and
vetch
folding
his
arms
and
assuming
an
attitude
of
easy
contempt
directed
his
attention
to
sarah
purfoy
she
seemed
an
object
of
general
attraction
for
at
the
same
moment
a
young
soldier
ran
up
the
ladder
to
the
forecastle
and
eagerly
bent
his
gaze
in
her
direction
maurice
frere
had
come
behind
her
and
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
since
their
conversation
the
previous
evening
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
fooled
no
longer
the
girl
was
evidently
playing
with
him
and
he
would
show
her
that
he
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
well
sarah
well
frere
dropping
her
hand
and
turning
round
with
a
smile
how
well
you
are
looking
positively
lovely
you
have
told
me
that
so
often
says
she
with
a
pout
have
you
nothing
else
to
say
except
that
i
love
this
in
a
most
impassioned
manner
that
is
no
news
i
know
you
curse
it
sarah
what
is
a
fellow
to
do
his
profligacy
was
failing
him
rapidly
what
is
the
use
of
playing
fast
and
loose
with
a
fellow
this
way
a
should
be
able
to
take
care
of
himself
frere
i
ask
you
to
fall
in
love
with
me
did
i
if
you
do
please
me
it
is
not
your
fault
what
do
you
mean
you
soldiers
have
so
many
things
to
think
of
your
guards
and
sentries
and
visits
and
things
you
have
no
time
to
spare
for
a
poor
woman
like
spare
cries
frere
in
amazement
why
damme
you
wo
let
a
fellow
spare
i
spare
fast
enough
if
that
was
she
cast
her
eyes
down
to
the
deck
and
a
modest
flush
rose
in
her
cheeks
i
have
so
much
to
do
she
said
in
a
there
are
so
many
eyes
upon
me
i
can
not
stir
without
being
she
raised
her
head
as
she
spoke
and
to
give
effect
to
her
words
looked
round
the
deck
her
glance
crossed
that
of
the
young
soldier
on
the
forecastle
and
though
the
distance
was
too
great
for
her
to
distinguish
his
features
she
guessed
who
he
was
miles
was
jealous
frere
smiling
with
delight
at
her
change
of
manner
came
close
to
her
and
whispered
in
her
ear
she
affected
to
start
and
took
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
a
signal
with
the
crow
i
will
come
at
eight
said
she
with
modestly
averted
face
they
relieve
the
guard
at
eight
he
said
deprecatingly
she
tossed
her
head
very
well
then
attend
to
your
guard
i
but
sarah
consider
as
if
a
woman
in
love
ever
considers
said
she
turning
upon
him
a
burning
glance
which
in
truth
might
have
melted
a
more
icy
man
than
he
she
loved
him
then
what
a
fool
he
would
be
to
refuse
to
get
her
to
come
was
the
first
object
how
to
make
duty
fit
with
pleasure
would
be
considered
afterwards
besides
the
guard
could
relieve
itself
for
once
without
his
supervision
very
well
at
eight
then
hush
said
she
here
comes
that
stupid
and
as
frere
left
her
she
turned
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
convict
barricade
dropped
the
handkerchief
she
held
in
her
hand
over
the
poop
railing
it
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
amorous
captain
and
with
a
quick
upward
glance
that
worthy
fellow
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
to
her
oh
thank
you
captain
blunt
said
she
and
her
eyes
spoke
more
than
her
tongue
did
you
take
the
laudanum
whispered
blunt
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
some
of
it
said
she
i
will
bring
you
back
the
bottle
blunt
walked
aft
humming
cheerily
and
saluted
frere
with
a
slap
on
the
back
the
two
men
laughed
each
at
his
own
thoughts
but
their
laughter
only
made
the
surrounding
gloom
seem
deeper
than
before
sarah
purfoy
casting
her
eyes
toward
the
barricade
observed
a
change
in
the
position
of
the
three
men
they
were
together
once
more
and
the
crow
having
taken
off
his
prison
cap
held
it
at
arm
length
with
one
hand
while
he
wiped
his
brow
with
the
other
her
signal
had
been
observed
during
all
this
rufus
dawes
removed
to
the
hospital
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
staring
at
the
deck
above
him
trying
to
think
of
something
he
wanted
to
say
when
the
sudden
faintness
which
was
the
prelude
to
his
sickness
had
overpowered
him
he
remembered
being
torn
out
of
his
bunk
by
fierce
hands
remembered
a
vision
of
savage
faces
and
the
presence
of
some
danger
that
menaced
him
he
remembered
that
while
lying
on
his
blankets
struggling
with
the
coming
fever
he
had
overheard
a
conversation
of
vital
importance
to
himself
and
to
the
ship
but
of
the
purport
of
that
conversation
he
had
not
the
least
idea
in
vain
he
strove
to
remember
in
vain
his
will
struggling
with
delirium
brought
back
snatches
and
echoes
of
sense
they
slipped
from
him
again
as
fast
as
caught
he
was
oppressed
with
the
weight
of
thought
he
knew
that
a
terrible
danger
menaced
him
that
could
he
but
force
his
brain
to
reason
connectedly
for
ten
consecutive
minutes
he
could
give
such
information
as
would
avert
that
danger
and
save
the
ship
but
lying
with
hot
head
parched
lips
and
enfeebled
body
he
was
as
one
possessed
he
could
move
nor
hand
nor
foot
the
place
where
he
lay
was
but
dimly
lighted
the
ingenuity
of
pine
had
constructed
a
canvas
blind
over
the
port
to
prevent
the
sun
striking
into
the
cabin
and
this
blind
absorbed
much
of
the
light
he
could
but
just
see
the
deck
above
his
head
and
distinguish
the
outlines
of
three
other
berths
apparently
similar
to
his
own
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
silence
were
the
gurgling
of
the
water
below
him
and
the
tap
tap
tap
tap
of
pine
hammers
at
work
upon
the
new
partition
by
and
by
the
noise
of
these
hammers
ceased
and
then
the
sick
man
could
hear
gasps
and
moans
and
mutterings
the
signs
that
his
companions
yet
lived
all
at
once
a
voice
called
out
of
course
his
bills
are
worth
four
hundred
pounds
but
my
good
sir
four
hundred
pounds
to
a
man
in
my
position
is
not
worth
the
getting
why
i
given
four
hundred
pounds
for
a
freak
of
my
girl
sarah
is
it
right
eh
jezebel
she
a
good
girl
though
as
girls
go
lionel
crofton
of
the
crofts
sevenoaks
kent
sevenoaks
kent
seven
a
gleam
of
light
broke
in
on
the
darkness
which
wrapped
rufus
tortured
brain
the
man
was
john
rex
his
berth
mate
with
an
effort
he
spoke
rex
yes
yes
i
coming
do
be
in
a
hurry
the
sentry
safe
and
the
howitzer
is
but
five
paces
from
the
door
a
rush
upon
deck
lads
and
she
ours
that
is
mine
mine
and
my
wife
lionel
crofton
of
seven
crofts
no
oaks
sarah
purfoy
and
nurse
ha
ha
and
nurse
this
last
sentence
contained
the
to
the
labyrinth
in
which
rufus
dawes
bewildered
intellects
were
wandering
sarah
purfoy
he
remembered
now
each
detail
of
the
conversation
he
had
so
strangely
overheard
and
how
imperative
it
was
that
he
should
without
delay
reveal
the
plot
that
threatened
the
ship
how
that
plot
was
to
be
carried
out
he
did
not
pause
to
consider
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
hanging
over
the
brink
of
delirium
and
that
unless
he
made
himself
understood
before
his
senses
utterly
deserted
him
all
was
lost
he
attempted
to
rise
but
found
that
his
limbs
refused
to
obey
the
impulse
of
his
will
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
his
jaws
stuck
together
he
could
not
raise
a
finger
nor
utter
a
sound
the
boards
over
his
head
waved
like
a
shaken
sheet
and
the
cabin
whirled
round
while
the
patch
of
light
at
his
feet
bobbed
up
and
down
like
the
reflection
from
a
wavering
candle
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
terrible
sigh
of
despair
and
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
at
that
instant
the
sound
of
hammering
ceased
and
the
door
opened
it
was
six
and
pine
had
come
to
have
a
last
look
at
his
patients
before
dinner
it
seemed
that
there
was
somebody
with
him
for
a
kind
though
somewhat
pompous
voice
remarked
upon
the
scantiness
of
accommodation
and
the
necessity
the
absolute
necessity
of
complying
with
the
king
regulations
honest
vickers
though
agonized
for
the
safety
of
his
child
would
not
abate
a
jot
of
his
duty
and
had
sternly
come
to
visit
the
sick
men
aware
as
he
was
that
such
a
visit
would
necessitate
his
isolation
from
the
cabin
where
his
child
lay
vickers
weeping
and
bewailing
herself
coquettishly
at
garrison
parties
had
often
said
that
poor
dear
john
was
such
a
disciplinarian
quite
a
slave
to
the
here
they
are
said
pine
six
of
this
fellow
going
to
the
side
of
rex
is
the
worst
if
he
had
not
a
constitution
like
a
horse
i
do
think
he
could
live
out
the
three
eighteen
seven
four
muttered
rex
dot
and
carry
one
is
that
an
occupation
for
a
gentleman
no
sir
good
night
my
lord
good
night
hark
the
clock
is
striking
nine
five
six
seven
eight
well
you
had
your
day
and
ca
a
dangerous
fellow
says
pine
with
the
light
upraised
a
very
dangerous
fellow
that
is
he
was
this
is
the
place
you
see
a
regular
but
what
can
one
do
come
let
us
get
on
deck
said
vickers
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
rufus
dawes
felt
the
sweat
break
out
into
beads
on
his
forehead
they
suspected
nothing
they
were
going
away
he
must
warn
them
with
a
violent
effort
in
his
agony
he
turned
over
in
the
bunk
and
thrust
out
his
hand
from
the
blankets
hullo
what
this
cried
pine
bringing
the
lantern
to
bear
upon
it
lie
down
my
man
eh
water
is
it
there
steady
with
it
now
and
he
lifted
a
pannikin
to
the
blackened
lips
the
cool
draught
moistened
his
parched
gullet
and
the
convict
made
a
last
effort
to
speak
sarah
purfoy
the
prison
mutiny
the
last
word
almost
shrieked
out
in
the
sufferer
desperate
efforts
to
articulate
recalled
the
wandering
senses
of
john
rex
hush
he
cried
is
that
you
jemmy
sarah
right
wait
till
she
gives
the
he
raving
said
vickers
pine
caught
the
convict
by
the
shoulder
what
do
you
say
my
man
a
mutiny
of
the
prisoners
with
his
mouth
agape
and
his
hands
clenched
rufus
dawes
incapable
of
further
speech
made
a
last
effort
to
nod
assent
but
his
head
fell
upon
his
breast
the
next
moment
the
flickering
light
the
gloomy
prison
the
eager
face
of
the
doctor
and
the
astonished
face
of
vickers
vanished
from
before
his
straining
eyes
he
saw
the
two
men
stare
at
each
other
in
mingled
incredulity
and
alarm
and
then
he
was
floating
down
the
cool
brown
river
of
his
boyhood
on
his
way
in
company
with
sarah
purfoy
and
lieutenant
frere
to
raise
the
mutiny
of
the
hydaspes
that
lay
on
the
stocks
in
the
old
house
at
hampstead
chapter
ix
woman
weapons
the
two
discoverers
of
this
awkward
secret
held
a
council
of
war
vickers
was
for
at
once
calling
the
guard
and
announcing
to
the
prisoners
that
the
plot
whatever
it
might
be
had
been
discovered
but
pine
accustomed
to
convict
ships
overruled
this
decision
you
do
know
these
fellows
as
well
as
i
do
said
he
in
the
first
place
there
may
be
no
mutiny
at
all
the
whole
thing
is
perhaps
some
absurdity
of
that
fellow
dawes
and
should
we
once
put
the
notion
of
attacking
us
into
the
prisoners
heads
there
is
no
telling
what
they
might
but
the
man
seemed
certain
said
the
other
he
mentioned
my
maid
too
suppose
he
did
and
begad
i
dare
say
he
right
i
never
liked
the
look
of
the
girl
to
tell
them
that
we
have
found
them
out
this
time
wo
prevent
trying
it
again
we
do
know
what
their
scheme
is
either
if
it
is
a
mutiny
half
the
ship
company
may
be
in
it
no
captain
vickers
allow
me
as
to
settle
our
course
of
action
you
are
aware
that
that
by
the
king
regulations
you
are
invested
with
full
powers
interrupted
vickers
mindful
of
discipline
in
any
extremity
of
course
i
merely
suggested
and
i
know
nothing
about
the
girl
except
that
she
brought
a
good
character
from
her
last
mistress
a
crofton
i
think
the
name
was
we
were
glad
to
get
anybody
to
make
a
voyage
like
well
says
pine
look
here
suppose
we
tell
these
scoundrels
that
their
design
whatever
it
may
be
is
known
very
good
they
will
profess
absolute
ignorance
and
try
again
on
the
next
opportunity
when
perhaps
we
may
not
know
anything
about
it
at
all
events
we
are
completely
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
plot
and
the
names
of
the
ringleaders
let
us
double
the
sentries
and
quietly
get
the
men
under
arms
let
miss
sarah
do
what
she
pleases
and
when
the
mutiny
breaks
out
we
will
nip
it
in
the
bud
clap
all
the
villains
we
get
in
irons
and
hand
them
over
to
the
authorities
in
hobart
town
i
am
not
a
cruel
man
sir
but
we
have
got
a
cargo
of
wild
beasts
aboard
and
we
must
be
but
surely
pine
have
you
considered
the
probable
loss
of
life
i
really
some
more
humane
course
perhaps
prevention
you
know
pine
turned
round
upon
him
with
that
grim
practicality
which
was
a
part
of
his
nature
have
you
considered
the
safety
of
the
ship
captain
vickers
you
know
or
have
heard
of
the
sort
of
things
that
take
place
in
these
mutinies
have
you
considered
what
will
befall
those
women
in
the
soldiers
berths
have
you
thought
of
the
fate
of
your
own
wife

be
easy
sir

old

i
am
acting
for
the
best
upon
my
soul
i
am
you
do
know
what
convicts
are
or
rather
what
the
law
has
made
yet
poor
wretches
says
vickers
who
like
many
martinets
was
in
reality
kindness
might
do
much
for
them
after
all
they
are
our
yes
returned
the
other
they
are
but
if
you
use
that
argument
to
them
when
they
have
taken
the
vessel
it
wo
avail
you
much
let
me
manage
sir
and
for
god
sake
say
nothing
to
anybody
our
lives
may
hang
upon
a
vickers
promised
and
kept
his
promise
so
far
as
to
chat
cheerily
with
blunt
and
frere
at
dinner
only
writing
a
brief
note
to
his
wife
to
tell
her
that
whatever
she
heard
she
was
not
to
stir
from
her
cabin
until
he
came
to
her
he
knew
that
with
all
his
wife
folly
she
would
obey
unhesitatingly
when
he
couched
an
order
in
such
terms
according
to
the
usual
custom
on
board
convict
ships
the
guards
relieved
each
other
every
two
hours
and
at
six
the
poop
guard
was
removed
to
the
and
the
arms
which
in
the
daytime
were
disposed
on
the
top
of
the
were
placed
in
an
constructed
on
the
for
that
purpose
trusting
nothing
to
frere
who
indeed
by
pine
advice
was
as
we
have
seen
kept
in
ignorance
of
the
whole
matter
vickers
ordered
all
the
men
save
those
who
had
been
on
guard
during
the
day
to
be
under
arms
in
the
barrack
forbade
communication
with
the
upper
deck
and
placed
as
sentry
at
the
barrack
door
his
own
servant
an
old
soldier
on
whose
fidelity
he
could
thoroughly
rely
he
then
doubled
the
guards
took
the
keys
of
the
prison
himself
from
the
officer
whose
duty
it
was
to
keep
them
and
saw
that
the
howitzer
on
the
lower
deck
was
loaded
with
grape
it
was
a
quarter
to
seven
when
pine
and
he
took
their
station
at
the
main
hatchway
determined
to
watch
until
morning
at
a
quarter
past
seven
any
curious
person
looking
through
the
window
of
captain
blunt
cabin
would
have
seen
an
unusual
sight
that
gallant
commander
was
sitting
on
the
with
a
glass
of
rum
and
water
in
his
hand
and
the
handsome
of
vickers
was
seated
on
a
stool
by
his
side
at
a
first
glance
it
was
perceptible
that
the
captain
was
very
drunk
his
grey
hair
was
matted
all
ways
about
his
reddened
face
and
he
was
winking
and
blinking
like
an
owl
in
the
sunshine
he
had
drunk
a
larger
quantity
of
wine
than
usual
at
dinner
in
sheer
delight
at
the
approaching
assignation
and
having
got
out
the
rum
bottle
for
a
quiet
settler
just
as
the
victim
of
his
fascinations
glided
through
the
door
he
had
been
persuaded
to
go
on
drinking
sarah
he
hiccuped
it
all
very
fine
my
lass
but

malabar
wors
good

sarah
allowed
a
laugh
to
escape
her
and
artfully
protruded
an
ankle
at
the
same
time
the
amorous
phineas
lurched
over
and
made
shift
to
take
her
hand

i

went
to
the
door
wotsh

and
he
staggered
up
and
with
the
grog
swaying
fearfully
in
one
hand
made
at
her
the
ship
bell
struck
the
now
or
never
was
the
time
blunt
caught
her
round
the
waist
with
one
arm
and
hiccuping
with
love
and
rum
approached
to
take
the
kiss
he
coveted
she
seized
the
moment
surrendered
herself
to
his
embrace
drew
from
her
pocket
the
laudanum
bottle
and
passing
her
hand
over
his
shoulder
poured
half
its
contents
into
the
glass
think

nun
not
i
my
you
will
be
if
you

much
more
come
finish
that
and
be
quiet
or
i
go
but
she
threw
a
provocation
into
her
glance
as
she
spoke
which
belied
her
words
and
which
penetrated
even
the
sodden
intellect
of
poor
blunt
he
balanced
himself
on
his
heels
for
a
moment
and
holding
by
the
moulding
of
the
cabin
stared
at
her
with
a
fatuous
smile
of
drunken
admiration
then
looked
at
the
glass
in
his
hand
hiccuped
with
much
solemnity
thrice
and
as
though
struck
with
a
sudden
sense
of
duty
unfulfilled
swallowed
the
contents
at
a
gulp
the
effect
was
almost
instantaneous
he
dropped
the
tumbler
lurched
towards
the
woman
at
the
door
and
then
making
a
in
accordance
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
fell
into
his
bunk
and
snored
like
a
grampus
sarah
purfoy
watched
him
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
having
blown
out
the
light
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
dusky
gloom
which
had
held
the
deck
on
the
previous
night
enveloped
all
forward
of
the
a
lantern
swung
in
the
forecastle
and
swayed
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
the
light
at
the
prison
door
threw
a
glow
through
the
open
hatch
and
in
the
cuddy
at
her
right
hand
the
usual
row
of
burned
she
looked
mechanically
for
vickers
who
was
ordinarily
there
at
that
hour
but
the
cuddy
was
empty
so
much
the
better
she
thought
as
she
drew
her
dark
cloak
around
her
and
tapped
at
frere
door
as
she
did
so
a
strange
pain
shot
through
her
temples
and
her
knees
trembled
with
a
strong
effort
she
dispelled
the
dizziness
that
had
almost
overpowered
her
and
held
herself
erect
it
would
never
do
to
break
down
now
the
door
opened
and
maurice
frere
drew
her
into
the
cabin
so
you
have
come
said
he
you
see
i
have
but
oh
if
i
should
be
seen
seen
nonsense
who
is
to
see
you
captain
vickers
doctor
pine
not
they
besides
they
gone
off
down
to
pine
cabin
since
dinner
they
all
gone
off
to
pine
cabin
the
intelligence
struck
her
with
dismay
what
was
the
cause
of
such
an
unusual
proceeding
surely
they
did
not
suspect
what
do
they
want
there
she
asked
maurice
frere
was
not
in
the
humour
to
argue
questions
of
probability
who
knows
i
do
confound
he
added
what
does
it
matter
to
us
we
do
want
them
do
we
sarah
she
seemed
to
be
listening
for
something
and
did
not
reply
her
nervous
system
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
excitement
the
success
of
the
plot
depended
on
the
next
five
minutes
what
are
you
staring
at
look
at
me
ca
you
what
eyes
you
have
and
what
hair
at
that
instant
the
report
of
a
broke
the
silence
the
mutiny
had
begun
the
sound
awoke
the
soldier
to
a
sense
of
his
duty
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
disengaging
the
arms
that
clung
about
his
neck
made
for
the
door
the
moment
for
which
the
convict
accomplice
had
waited
approached
she
hung
upon
him
with
all
her
weight
her
long
hair
swept
across
his
face
her
warm
breath
was
on
his
cheek
her
dress
exposed
her
round
smooth
shoulder
he
intoxicated
conquered
had
back
when
suddenly
the
rich
crimson
died
away
from
her
lips
leaving
them
an
ashen
grey
colour
her
eyes
closed
in
agony
loosing
her
hold
of
him
she
staggered
to
her
feet
pressed
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
and
uttered
a
sharp
cry
of
pain
the
fever
which
had
been
on
her
two
days
and
which
by
a
strong
exercise
of
will
she
had
struggled
against
encouraged
by
the
violent
excitement
of
the
occasion
had
attacked
her
at
this
supreme
moment
deathly
pale
and
sick
she
reeled
to
the
side
of
the
cabin
there
was
another
shot
and
a
violent
clashing
of
arms
and
frere
leaving
the
miserable
woman
to
her
fate
leapt
out
on
to
the
deck
chapter
x
eight
bells
at
seven
there
had
been
also
a
commotion
in
the
prison
the
news
of
the
fever
had
awoke
in
the
convicts
all
that
love
of
liberty
which
had
but
slumbered
during
the
monotony
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
voyage
now
that
death
menaced
them
they
longed
fiercely
for
the
chance
of
escape
which
seemed
permitted
to
freemen
let
us
get
out
they
said
each
man
speaking
to
his
particular
friend
we
are
locked
up
here
to
die
like
gloomy
faces
and
desponding
looks
met
the
gaze
of
each
and
sometimes
across
this
gloom
shot
a
fierce
glance
that
lighted
up
its
blackness
as
a
renders
luridly
luminous
the
indigo
dullness
of
a
by
and
by
in
some
inexplicable
way
it
came
to
be
understood
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
afloat
that
they
were
to
be
released
from
their
shambles
that
some
amongst
them
had
been
plotting
for
freedom
the
decks
held
its
foul
breath
in
wondering
anxiety
afraid
to
breathe
its
suspicions
the
influence
of
this
predominant
idea
showed
itself
by
a
strange
shifting
of
atoms
the
mass
of
villainy
ignorance
and
innocence
began
to
be
animated
with
something
like
a
uniform
movement
natural
affinities
came
together
and
like
allied
itself
to
like
falling
noiselessly
into
harmony
as
the
pieces
of
glass
and
coloured
beads
in
a
kaleidoscope
assume
mathematical
forms
by
seven
bells
it
was
found
that
the
prison
was
divided
into
three
parties
the
desperate
the
timid
and
the
cautious
these
three
parties
had
arranged
themselves
in
natural
sequence
the
mutineers
headed
by
gabbett
vetch
and
the
moocher
were
nearest
to
the
door
the
timid
boys
old
men
innocent
poor
wretches
condemned
on
circumstantial
evidence
or
rustics
condemned
to
be
turned
into
thieves
for
pulling
a
turnip
were
at
the
farther
end
huddling
together
in
alarm
and
the
prudent
that
is
to
say
all
the
rest
ready
to
fight
or
fly
advance
or
retreat
assist
the
authorities
or
their
companions
as
the
fortune
of
the
day
might
direct
occupied
the
middle
space
the
mutineers
proper
numbered
perhaps
some
thirty
men
and
of
these
thirty
only
half
a
dozen
knew
what
was
really
about
to
be
done
the
ship
bell
strikes
the
and
as
the
cries
of
the
three
sentries
passing
the
word
to
the
die
away
gabbett
who
has
been
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
door
nudges
jemmy
vetch
now
jemmy
says
he
in
a
whisper
tell
the
whisper
being
heard
by
those
nearest
the
giant
a
silence
ensues
which
gradually
spreads
like
a
ripple
over
the
surface
of
the
crowd
reaching
even
the
bunks
at
the
further
end
gentlemen
says
vetch
politely
sarcastic
in
his
own
hangdog
fashion
myself
and
my
friends
here
are
going
to
take
the
ship
for
you
those
who
like
to
join
us
had
better
speak
at
once
for
in
about
half
an
hour
they
will
not
have
the
he
pauses
and
looks
round
with
such
an
impertinently
confident
air
that
three
waverers
in
the
party
amidships
slip
nearer
to
hear
him
you
need
be
afraid
vetch
continues
we
have
arranged
it
all
for
you
there
are
friends
waiting
for
us
outside
and
the
door
will
be
open
directly
all
we
want
gentlemen
is
your
vote
and
interest
i
mean
your
gaffing
agin
interrupts
the
giant
angrily
come
to
business
yer
tell
they
may
like
it
or
lump
it
but
we
mean
to
have
the
ship
and
them
as
refuses
to
join
us
we
mean
to
chuck
overboard
that
about
the
plain
english
of
it
this
practical
way
of
putting
it
produces
a
sensation
and
the
conservative
party
at
the
other
end
look
in
each
other
faces
with
some
alarm
a
grim
murmur
runs
round
and
somebody
near
gabbett
laughs
a
laugh
of
mingled
ferocity
and
amusement
not
reassuring
to
timid
people
what
about
the
sogers
asked
a
voice
from
the
ranks
of
the
cautious
d
the
sogers
cries
the
moocher
moved
by
a
sudden
inspiration
they
can
but
shoot
yer
and
that
as
good
as
dyin
of
typhus
anyway
the
right
chord
had
been
struck
now
and
with
a
stifled
roar
the
prison
admitted
the
truth
of
the
sentiment
go
on
old
man
cries
jemmy
vetch
to
the
giant
rubbing
his
thin
hands
with
eldritch
glee
they
all
right
and
then
his
quick
ears
catching
the
jingle
of
arms
he
said
stand
by
now
for
the
door
one
rush
do
it
was
eight
and
the
relief
guard
was
coming
from
the
after
deck
the
crowd
of
prisoners
round
the
door
held
their
breath
to
listen
it
all
planned
says
gabbett
in
a
low
growl
the
door
we
rush
and
we
in
among
the
guard
afore
they
know
where
they
are
drag
back
into
the
prison
grab
the
and
it
all
they
very
quiet
about
it
says
the
crow
suspiciously
i
hope
all
stand
from
the
door
miles
says
pine
voice
outside
in
its
usual
calm
accents
the
crow
was
relieved
the
tone
was
an
ordinary
one
and
miles
was
the
soldier
whom
sarah
purfoy
had
bribed
not
to
fire
all
had
gone
well
the
keys
clashed
and
turned
and
the
bravest
of
the
prudent
party
who
had
been
turning
in
his
mind
the
notion
of
risking
his
life
for
a
pardon
to
be
won
by
rushing
forward
at
the
right
moment
and
alarming
the
guard
checked
the
cry
that
was
in
his
throat
as
he
saw
the
men
round
the
door
draw
back
a
little
for
their
rush
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
giant
bristling
scalp
and
bared
gums
now
cries
jemmy
vetch
as
the
oak
swung
back
and
with
the
guttural
snarl
of
a
charging
wild
boar
gabbett
hurled
himself
out
of
the
prison
the
red
line
of
light
which
glowed
for
an
instant
through
the
doorway
was
blotted
out
by
a
mass
of
figures
all
the
prison
surged
forward
and
before
the
eye
could
wink
five
ten
twenty
of
the
most
desperate
were
outside
it
was
as
though
a
sea
breaking
against
a
stone
wall
had
found
some
breach
through
which
to
pour
its
waters
the
contagion
of
battle
spread
caution
was
forgotten
and
those
at
the
back
seeing
jemmy
vetch
raised
upon
the
crest
of
that
human
billow
which
reared
its
black
outline
against
an
indistinct
perspective
of
struggling
figures
responded
to
his
grin
of
encouragement
by
rushing
furiously
forward
suddenly
a
horrible
roar
like
that
of
a
trapped
wild
beast
was
heard
the
rushing
torrent
choked
in
the
doorway
and
from
out
the
lantern
glow
into
which
the
giant
had
rushed
a
flash
broke
followed
by
a
groan
as
the
perfidious
sentry
fell
back
shot
through
the
breast
the
mass
in
the
doorway
hung
irresolute
and
then
by
sheer
weight
of
pressure
from
behind
burst
forward
and
as
it
so
burst
the
heavy
door
crashed
into
its
jambs
and
the
bolts
were
shot
into
their
places
all
this
took
place
by
one
of
those
simultaneous
movements
which
are
so
rapid
in
execution
so
tedious
to
describe
in
detail
at
one
instant
the
prison
door
had
opened
at
the
next
it
had
closed
the
picture
which
had
presented
itself
to
the
eyes
of
the
convicts
was
as
momentary
as
are
those
of
the
thaumatoscope
the
period
of
time
that
had
elapsed
between
the
opening
and
the
shutting
of
the
door
could
have
been
marked
by
the
musket
shot
the
report
of
another
shot
and
then
a
noise
of
confused
cries
mingled
with
the
clashing
of
arms
informed
the
imprisoned
men
that
the
ship
had
been
alarmed
how
would
it
go
with
their
friends
on
deck
would
they
succeed
in
overcoming
the
guards
or
would
they
be
beaten
back
they
would
soon
know
and
in
the
hot
dusk
straining
their
eyes
to
see
each
other
they
waited
for
the
issue
suddenly
the
noises
ceased
and
a
strange
rumbling
sound
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
listeners
what
had
taken
place
this
the
men
pouring
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
sudden
glare
of
the
lanterns
rushed
bewildered
across
the
deck
miles
true
to
his
promise
did
not
fire
but
the
next
instant
vickers
had
snatched
the
firelock
from
him
and
leaping
into
the
stream
turned
about
and
fired
down
towards
the
prison
the
attack
was
more
sudden
then
he
had
expected
but
he
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
the
shot
would
serve
a
double
purpose
it
would
warn
the
men
in
the
barrack
and
perhaps
check
the
rush
by
stopping
up
the
doorway
with
a
corpse
beaten
back
struggling
and
indignant
amid
the
storm
of
hideous
faces
his
humanity
vanished
and
he
aimed
deliberately
at
the
head
of
james
vetch
the
shot
however
missed
its
mark
and
killed
the
unhappy
miles
gabbett
and
his
companions
had
by
this
time
reached
the
foot
of
the
companion
ladder
there
to
encounter
the
cutlasses
of
the
doubled
guard
gleaming
redly
in
the
glow
of
the
lanterns
a
glance
up
the
hatchway
showed
the
giant
that
the
arms
he
had
planned
to
seize
were
defended
by
ten
firelocks
and
that
behind
the
open
doors
of
the
partition
which
ran
abaft
the
mizenmast
the
remainder
of
the
detachment
stood
to
their
arms
even
his
dull
intellect
comprehended
that
the
desperate
project
had
failed
and
that
he
had
been
betrayed
with
the
roar
of
despair
which
had
penetrated
into
the
prison
he
turned
to
fight
his
way
back
just
in
time
to
see
the
crowd
in
the
gangway
recoil
from
the
flash
of
the
musket
fired
by
vickers
the
next
instant
pine
and
two
soldiers
taking
advantage
of
the
momentary
cessation
of
the
press
shot
the
bolts
and
secured
the
prison
the
mutineers
were
caught
in
a
trap
the
narrow
space
between
the
barracks
and
the
barricade
was
choked
with
struggling
figures
some
twenty
convicts
and
half
as
many
soldiers
struck
and
stabbed
at
each
other
in
the
crowd
there
was
barely
and
attacked
and
attackers
fought
almost
without
knowing
whom
they
struck
gabbett
tore
a
cutlass
from
a
soldier
shook
his
huge
head
and
calling
on
the
moocher
to
follow
bounded
up
the
ladder
desperately
determined
to
brave
the
fire
of
the
watch
the
moocher
close
at
the
giant
heels
flung
himself
upon
the
nearest
soldier
and
grasping
his
wrist
struggled
for
the
cutlass
a
brawny
fellow
next
him
dashed
his
clenched
fist
in
the
soldier
face
and
the
man
maddened
by
the
blow
let
go
the
cutlass
and
drawing
his
pistol
shot
his
new
assailant
through
the
head
it
was
this
second
shot
that
had
aroused
maurice
frere
as
the
young
lieutenant
sprang
out
upon
the
deck
he
saw
by
the
position
of
the
guard
that
others
had
been
more
mindful
of
the
safety
of
the
ship
than
he
there
was
however
no
time
for
explanation
for
as
he
reached
the
hatchway
he
was
met
by
the
ascending
giant
who
uttered
a
hideous
oath
at
the
sight
of
this
unexpected
adversary
and
too
close
to
strike
him
locked
him
in
his
arms
the
two
men
were
drawn
together
the
guard
on
the
dared
not
fire
at
the
two
bodies
that
twined
about
each
other
rolled
across
the
deck
and
for
a
moment
cherished
existence
hung
upon
the
slenderest
thread
imaginable
the
moocher
spattered
with
the
blood
and
brains
of
his
unfortunate
comrade
had
already
set
his
foot
upon
the
lowest
step
of
the
ladder
when
the
cutlass
was
dashed
from
his
hand
by
a
blow
from
a
clubbed
firelock
and
he
was
dragged
roughly
backwards
as
he
fell
upon
the
deck
he
saw
the
crow
spring
out
of
the
mass
of
prisoners
who
had
been
an
instant
before
struggling
with
the
guard
and
gaining
the
cleared
space
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
hold
up
his
hands
as
though
to
shield
himself
from
a
blow
the
confusion
had
now
become
suddenly
stilled
and
upon
the
group
before
the
barricade
had
fallen
that
mysterious
silence
which
had
perplexed
the
inmates
of
the
prison
they
were
not
perplexed
for
long
the
two
soldiers
who
with
the
assistance
of
pine
had
the
door
of
the
prison
rapidly
unbolted
that
in
the
barricade
of
which
mention
has
been
made
in
a
previous
chapter
and
at
a
signal
from
vickers
three
men
ran
the
loaded
howitzer
from
its
sinister
shelter
near
the
break
of
the
barrack
berths
and
training
the
deadly
muzzle
to
a
level
with
the
opening
in
the
barricade
stood
ready
to
fire
surrender
cried
vickers
in
a
voice
from
which
all
humanity
had
vanished
surrender
and
give
up
your
ringleaders
or
i
blow
you
to
pieces
there
was
no
tremor
in
his
voice
and
though
he
stood
with
pine
by
his
side
at
the
very
mouth
of
the
levelled
cannon
the
mutineers
perceived
with
that
acuteness
which
imminent
danger
brings
to
the
most
stolid
of
brains
that
did
they
hesitate
an
instant
he
would
keep
his
word
there
was
an
awful
moment
of
silence
broken
only
by
a
skurrying
noise
in
the
prison
as
though
a
family
of
rats
disturbed
at
a
flour
cask
were
scampering
to
the
ship
side
for
shelter
this
skurrying
noise
was
made
by
the
convicts
rushing
to
their
berths
to
escape
the
threatened
shower
of
grape
to
the
twenty
desperadoes
cowering
before
the
muzzle
of
the
howitzer
it
spoke
more
eloquently
than
words
the
charm
was
broken
their
comrades
would
refuse
to
join
them
the
position
of
affairs
at
this
crisis
was
a
strange
one
from
the
opened
came
a
sort
of
subdued
murmur
like
that
which
sounds
within
the
folds
of
a
but
in
the
oblong
block
of
darkness
which
it
framed
nothing
was
visible
the
might
have
been
a
window
looking
into
a
tunnel
on
each
side
of
this
horrible
window
almost
pushed
before
it
by
the
pressure
of
one
upon
the
other
stood
pine
vickers
and
the
guard
in
front
of
the
little
group
lay
the
corpse
of
the
miserable
boy
whom
sarah
purfoy
had
led
to
ruin
and
forced
close
upon
yet
shrinking
back
from
the
trampled
and
bloody
mass
crouched
in
mingled
terror
and
rage
the
twenty
mutineers
behind
the
mutineers
withdrawn
from
the
patch
of
light
thrown
by
the
open
hatchway
the
mouth
of
the
howitzer
threatened
destruction
and
behind
the
howitzer
backed
up
by
an
array
of
brown
musket
barrels
suddenly
glowed
the
tiny
fire
of
the
burning
match
in
the
hand
of
vickers
trusty
servant
the
entrapped
men
looked
up
the
hatchway
but
the
guard
had
already
closed
in
upon
it
and
some
of
the
ship
crew
with
that
carelessness
of
danger
characteristic
of
sailors
were
peering
down
upon
them
escape
was
hopeless
one
minute
cried
vickers
confident
that
one
second
would
be
enough
one
minute
to
go
quietly
or
surrender
mates
for
god
sake
shrieked
some
unknown
wretch
from
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
prison
do
you
want
to
be
the
death
of
us
jemmy
vetch
feeling
by
that
curious
sympathy
which
nervous
natures
possess
that
his
comrades
wished
him
to
act
as
spokesman
raised
his
shrill
tones
we
surrender
he
said
it
no
use
getting
our
brains
blown
and
raising
his
hands
he
obeyed
the
motion
of
fingers
and
led
the
way
towards
the
barrack
bring
the
irons
forward
there
shouted
vickers
hastening
from
his
perilous
position
and
before
the
last
man
had
filed
past
the
still
smoking
match
the
cling
of
hammers
announced
that
the
crow
had
resumed
those
fetters
which
had
been
knocked
off
his
dainty
limbs
a
month
previously
in
the
bay
of
biscay
in
another
moment
the
was
closed
the
howitzer
rumbled
back
to
its
cleatings
and
the
prison
breathed
again
in
the
meantime
a
scene
almost
as
exciting
had
taken
place
on
the
upper
deck
gabbett
with
the
blind
fury
which
the
consciousness
of
failure
brings
to
such
natures
had
seized
frere
by
the
throat
determined
to
put
an
end
to
at
least
one
of
his
enemies
but
desperate
though
he
was
and
with
all
the
advantage
of
weight
and
strength
upon
his
side
he
found
the
young
lieutenant
a
more
formidable
adversary
than
he
had
anticipated
maurice
frere
was
no
coward
brutal
and
selfish
though
he
might
be
his
bitterest
enemies
had
never
accused
him
of
lack
of
physical
courage
indeed
he
had
been
in
the
rollicking
days
of
old
that
were
gone
celebrated
for
the
display
of
very
opposite
qualities
he
was
an
amateur
at
manly
sports
he
rejoiced
in
his
muscular
strength
and
in
many
a
tavern
brawl
and
midnight
riot
of
his
own
provoking
had
proved
the
fallacy
of
the
proverb
which
teaches
that
a
bully
is
always
a
coward
he
had
the
tenacity
of
a
bulldog
once
let
him
get
his
teeth
in
his
adversary
and
he
would
hold
on
till
he
died
in
fact
he
was
as
far
as
personal
vigour
went
a
gabbett
with
the
education
of
a
and
in
a
personal
encounter
between
two
men
of
equal
courage
science
tells
more
than
strength
in
the
struggle
however
that
was
now
taking
place
science
seemed
to
be
of
little
value
to
the
inexperienced
eye
it
would
appear
that
the
frenzied
giant
gripping
the
throat
of
the
man
who
had
fallen
beneath
him
must
rise
from
the
struggle
an
easy
victor
brute
force
was
all
that
was
needed
there
was
neither
room
nor
time
for
the
display
of
any
cunning
of
fence
but
knowledge
though
it
can
not
give
strength
gives
coolness
taken
by
surprise
as
he
was
maurice
frere
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
the
convict
was
so
close
upon
him
that
there
was
no
time
to
strike
but
as
he
was
forced
backwards
he
succeeded
in
crooking
his
knee
round
the
thigh
of
his
assailant
and
thrust
one
hand
into
his
collar
over
and
over
they
rolled
the
bewildered
sentry
not
daring
to
fire
until
the
ship
side
brought
them
up
with
a
violent
jerk
and
frere
realized
that
gabbett
was
below
him
pressing
with
all
the
might
of
his
muscles
he
strove
to
resist
the
leverage
which
the
giant
was
applying
to
turn
him
over
but
he
might
as
well
have
pushed
against
a
stone
wall
with
his
eyes
protruding
and
every
sinew
strained
to
its
uttermost
he
was
slowly
forced
round
and
he
felt
gabbett
releasing
his
grasp
in
order
to
draw
back
and
aim
at
him
an
effectual
blow
disengaging
his
left
hand
frere
suddenly
allowed
himself
to
sink
and
then
drawing
up
his
right
knee
struck
gabbett
beneath
the
jaw
and
as
the
huge
head
was
forced
backwards
by
the
blow
dashed
his
fist
into
the
brawny
throat
the
giant
reeled
backwards
and
falling
on
his
hands
and
knees
was
in
an
instant
surrounded
by
sailors
now
began
and
ended
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
it
one
of
those
homeric
struggles
of
one
man
against
twenty
which
are
none
the
less
heroic
because
the
ajax
is
a
convict
and
the
trojans
merely
ordinary
sailors
shaking
his
assailants
to
the
deck
as
easily
as
a
wild
boar
shakes
off
the
dogs
which
clamber
upon
his
bristly
sides
the
convict
sprang
to
his
feet
and
whirling
the
cutlass
round
his
head
kept
the
circle
at
bay
four
times
did
the
soldiers
round
the
hatchway
raise
their
muskets
and
four
times
did
the
fear
of
wounding
the
men
who
had
flung
themselves
upon
the
enraged
giant
compel
them
to
restrain
their
fire
gabbett
his
stubbly
hair
on
end
his
bloodshot
eyes
glaring
with
fury
his
great
hand
opening
and
shutting
in
air
as
though
it
gasped
for
something
to
seize
turned
himself
about
from
side
to
side
now
here
now
there
bellowing
like
a
wounded
bull
his
coarse
shirt
rent
from
shoulder
to
flank
exposed
the
play
of
his
huge
muscles
he
was
bleeding
from
a
cut
on
his
forehead
and
the
blood
trickling
down
his
face
mingled
with
the
foam
on
his
lips
and
dropped
sluggishly
on
his
hairy
breast
each
time
that
an
assailant
came
within
reach
of
the
swinging
cutlass
the
ruffian
form
dilated
with
a
fresh
access
of
passion
at
one
moment
bunched
with
clinging
adversaries
his
arms
legs
and
shoulders
a
hanging
mass
of
human
bodies
at
the
next
free
desperate
alone
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
his
hideous
countenance
contorted
with
hate
and
rage
the
giant
seemed
less
a
man
than
a
demon
or
one
of
those
monstrous
and
savage
apes
which
haunt
the
solitudes
of
the
african
forests
spurning
the
mob
who
had
rushed
in
at
him
he
strode
towards
his
risen
adversary
and
aimed
at
him
one
final
blow
that
should
put
an
end
to
his
tyranny
for
ever
a
notion
that
sarah
purfoy
had
betrayed
him
and
that
the
handsome
soldier
was
the
cause
of
the
betrayal
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
and
his
rage
had
concentrated
itself
upon
maurice
frere
the
aspect
of
the
villain
was
so
appalling
that
despite
his
natural
courage
frere
seeing
the
backward
sweep
of
the
cutlass
absolutely
closed
his
eyes
with
terror
and
surrendered
himself
to
his
fate
as
gabbett
balanced
himself
for
the
blow
the
ship
which
had
been
rocking
gently
on
a
dull
and
silent
sea
suddenly
lurched
the
convict
lost
his
balance
swayed
and
fell
ere
he
could
rise
he
was
pinioned
by
twenty
hands
authority
was
almost
instantaneously
triumphant
on
the
upper
and
lower
decks
the
mutiny
was
over
chapter
xi
discoveries
and
confessions
the
shock
was
felt
all
through
the
vessel
and
pine
who
had
been
watching
the
ironing
of
the
last
of
the
mutineers
at
once
divined
its
cause
thank
god
he
cried
there
a
breeze
at
last
and
as
the
overpowered
gabbett
bruised
bleeding
and
bound
was
dragged
down
the
hatchway
the
triumphant
doctor
hurried
upon
deck
to
find
the
malabar
plunging
through

whitening
water

the
influence

breeze

and
in
the
midst
of
the
cheery
confusion
maurice
frere
briefly
recapitulated
what
had
taken
place
taking
care
however
to
pass
over
his
own
dereliction
of
duty
as
rapidly
as
possible
pine
knit
his
brows
do
you
think
that
she
was
in
the
plot
he
asked
not
she
says
frere
eager
to
avert
inquiry
how
should
she
be
plot
she
sickening
of
fever
or
i
much
sure
enough
on
opening
the
door
of
the
cabin
they
found
sarah
purfoy
lying
where
she
had
fallen
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
clashing
of
cutlasses
and
the
firing
of
muskets
had
not
roused
her
we
must
make
a
somewhere
says
pine
looking
at
the
senseless
figure
with
no
kindly
glance
though
i
do
think
she
likely
to
be
very
bad
confound
her
i
believe
that
she
the
cause
of
all
this
find
out
too
before
many
hours
are
over
for
i
told
those
fellows
that
unless
they
confess
all
about
it
before
morning
i
get
them
six
dozen
the
day
after
we
anchor
in
hobart
town
i
a
great
mind
to
do
it
before
we
get
there
take
her
head
frere
and
get
her
out
of
this
before
vickers
comes
up
what
a
fool
you
are
to
be
sure
i
knew
what
it
would
be
with
women
aboard
ship
i
wonder
has
been
out
before
now
there
steady
past
the
door
why
man
one
would
think
you
never
had
your
arm
round
a
girl
waist
before
pooh
do
look
so
scared
i
wo
tell
make
haste
now
before
that
little
parson
comes
parsons

regular
old
women
to
chatter
and
thus
muttering
pine
assisted
to
carry

maid
into
her
cabin
by
george
but
she
a
fine
girl
he
said
viewing
the
inanimate
body
with
the
professional
eye
of
a
surgeon
i
do
wonder
at
you
making
a
fool
of
yourself
chances
are
you
caught
the
fever
though
this
breeze
will
help
to
blow
it
out
of
us
please
god
that
old
jackass
blunt
too
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
at
his
age
what
do
you
mean
asked
frere
hastily
as
he
heard
a
step
approach
what
has
blunt
to
say
about
her
oh

the

perhaps
laughed
at

the

he

flattered
himself
that
he

the

the

had
been
twisting
him
round
her

and
perhaps
imitating
his
for
the
gratification
of
her
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
and
yet
strange
to
say
the
idea
of
sarah
treachery
did
not
make

dislike
her
there
is
a

of

if

i

no

it
all

his

opened

she

possess

yawn
over

at

she
could

she

she
asked

said

pausing
on

all
is
safe
now

we
had
a

i
believe
how

the

was
lying
on

with
her

scattered
over
the

moving

to

though
she
has
been
talking
a

the
red
lips
parted
and
the
blue
eyes
brighter
than
ever
stared
vacantly
around
the
sound
of
her
father
voice
seemed
to
have
roused
her
for
she
began
to
speak
a
little
prayer
god
bless
papa
and
mamma
and
god
bless
all
on

this
ship
god
bless
me
and
make
me
a
good

for
jesus
christ
sake
our

the
sound
of
the
unconscious

simple
prayer
had
something
awesome
in
it
and
john

who
not
ten
minutes
before
would
have
sealed
his
own
death
warrant
unhesitatingly
to
preserve
the
safety
of

felt
his

they
were

sorry

that
their
breach
of

would
be
forgiven
it
was
the
fear
of
the
typhus
which
had
driven
them
to
it
they
had
no
accomplices
either
in
the
prison
or
out
of

but
they
felt
it
but
right
to
say
that
the
man
who
had
planned
the

was
rufus
the
malignant
cripple
had
guessed
from

the

never

the

were

extensive
on

on
the
north
side
of
the

was
a
small
farm
where
vegetables
were
grown
for

of

and
on

were

the
military
force
numbered
about
sixty
men
who
with
and
constables
took
charge
of
more
than
three
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
these
miserable
wretches
deprived
of
every
hope
were
employed
in
the
most
degrading
labour
no
beast
of
burden
was
allowed
on
the
settlement
all
the
pulling
and
dragging
was
done
by
human
beings
about
one
hundred
men
were
allowed
the
lighter
toil
of
dragging
timber
to
the
wharf
to
assist
in
shipbuilding
the
others
cut
down
the
trees
that
fringed
the
mainland
and
carried
them
on
their
shoulders
to
the
water
edge
the
denseness
of
the
scrub
and
bush
rendered
it
necessary
for
a
roadway
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
to
be
first
constructed
and
the
trunks
of
trees
stripped
of
their
branches
were
rolled
together
in
this
roadway
until
a
slide
was
made
down
which
the
heavier
logs
could
be
shunted
towards
the
harbour
the
timber
thus
obtained
was
made
into
rafts
and
floated
to
the
sheds
or
arranged
for
transportation
to
hobart
town
the
convicts
were
lodged
on
sarah
island
in
barracks
flanked
by
a
prison
whose
cells
were
the
terror
of
the
most
hardened
each
morning
they
received
their
breakfast
of
porridge
water
and
salt
and
then
rowed
under
the
protection
of
their
guard
to
the
stations
where
they
worked
without
food
until
night
the
launching
and
hewing
of
the
timber
compelled
them
to
work
up
to
their
waists
in
water
many
of
them
were
heavily
ironed
those
who
died
were
buried
on
a
little
plot
of
ground
called
halliday

from

name
of
the

buried
there

palisades
were
built
for
the
purpose
of
warding
off
the
terrific
blasts
of
wind
which
shrieking
through
the
long
and
narrow
bay
as
through
the
keyhole
of
a
door
had
in
former
times
tore
off
roofs
and
levelled
the
little
town
was
set
as
it
were
in
defiance
of
nature
at
the
very
extreme
of
civilization
and
its
inhabitants
maintained
perpetual
warfare
with
the
winds
and
waves
but
the
gaol
of
sarah
island
was
not
the
only
prison
in
this
desolate
region
at
a
little
distance
from
the
mainland
is
a
rock
over
the
rude
side
of
which
the
waves
dash
in
rough
weather
on
the
evening
of
the
december
as
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
on
the
left
side
of
the
harbour
the
figure
of
a
man
appeared
on
the
top
of
this
rock
he
was
clad
in
the
coarse
garb
of
a
convict
and
wore
round
his
ankles
two
iron
rings
connected
by
a
short
and
heavy
chain
to
the
middle
of
this
chain
a
leathern
strap
was
attached
which
splitting
in
the
form
of
a
t
buckled
round
his
waist
and
pulled
the
chain
high
enough
to
prevent
him
from
stumbling
over
it
as
he
walked
his
head
was
bare
and
his
coarse
shirt
open
at
the
throat
displayed
an
embrowned
and
muscular
neck
emerging
from
out
a
sort
of
cell
or
den
contrived
by
nature
or
art
in
the
side
of
the
cliff
he
threw
on
a
scanty
fire
which
burned
between
two
hollowed
rocks
a
small
log
of
pine
wood
and
then
returning
to
his
cave
and
bringing
from
it
an
iron
pot
which
contained
water
he
scooped
with
his
hands
a
for
it
in
the
ashes
and
placed
it
on
the
embers
it
was
evident
that
the
cave
was
at
once
his
storehouse
and
larder
and
that
the
two
hollowed
rocks
formed
his
kitchen
having
thus
made
preparations
for
supper
he
ascended
a
pathway
which
led
to
the
highest
point
of
the
rock
his
fetters
compelled
him
to
take
short
steps
and
as
he
walked
he
winced
as
though
the
iron
bit
him
a
handkerchief
or
strip
of
cloth
was
twisted
round
his
left
ankle
on
which
the
circlet
had
chafed
a
sore
painfully
and
slowly
he
gained
his
destination
and
flinging
himself
on
the
ground
gazed
around
him
the
afternoon
had
been
stormy
and
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
shone
redly
on
the
turbid
and
rushing
waters
of
the
bay
on
the
right
lay
sarah
island
on
the
left
the
bleak
shore
of
the
opposite
and
the
tall
peak
of
the
frenchman
cap
while
the
storm
hung
sullenly
over
the
barren
hills
to
the
eastward
below
him
appeared
the
only
sign
of
life
a
brig
was
being
towed
up
the
harbour
by
two
boats
the
sight
of
this
brig
seemed
to
rouse
in
the
mind
of
the
solitary
of
the
rock
a
strain
of
reflection
for
sinking
his
chin
upon
his
hand
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
incoming
vessel
and
immersed
himself
in
moody
thought
more
than
an
hour
had
passed
yet
he
did
not
move
the
ship
anchored
the
boats
detached
themselves
from
her
sides
the
sun
sank
and
the
bay
was
plunged
in
gloom
lights
began
to
twinkle
along
the
shore
of
the
settlement
the
little
fire
died
and
the
water
in
the
iron
pot
grew
cold
yet
the
watcher
on
the
rock
did
not
stir
with
his
eyes
staring
into
the
gloom
and
fixed
steadily
on
the
vessel
he
lay
along
the
barren
cliff
of
his
lonely
prison
as
motionless
as
the
rock
on
which
he
had
stretched
himself

solitary
man

a
social
evening
in
the
house
of
major
vickers
commandant
of
macquarie
harbour
there
was
on
this
evening
of
december
unusual
gaiety
lieutenant
maurice
frere
late
in
command
at
maria
island
had
unexpectedly
come
down
with
news
from
the
ladybird
government
schooner
visited
the
settlement
on
ordinary
occasions
twice
a
year
and
such
visits
were
looked
forward
to
with
no
little
eagerness
by
the
settlers
to
the
convicts
the
arrival
of
the
ladybird
meant
arrival
of
new
faces
intelligence
of
old
comrades
news
of
how
the
world
from
which
they
were
exiled
was
progressing
when
the
ladybird
arrived
the
chained
and
felons
felt
that
they
were
yet
human
that
the
universe
was
not
bounded
by
the
gloomy
forests
which
surrounded
their
prison
but
that
there
was
a
world
beyond
where
men
like
themselves
smoked
and
drank
and
laughed
and
rested
and
were
free
when
the
ladybird
arrived
they
heard
such
news
as
interested
them
that
is
to
say
not
mere
foolish
accounts
of
wars
or
ship
arrivals
or
city
gossip
but
matters
appertaining
to
their
own
world
how
tom
was
with
the
road
gangs
dick
on
a
harry
taken
to
the
bush
and
jack
hung
at
the
hobart
town
gaol
such
items
of
intelligence
were
the
only
news
they
cared
to
hear
and
the
were
well
posted
up
in
such
matters
to
the
convicts
the
ladybird
was
town
talk
theatre
stock
quotations
and
latest
telegrams
she
was
their
newspaper
and
the
one
excitement
of
their
dreary
existence
the
one
link
between
their
own
misery
and
the
happiness
of
their
to
the
commandant
and
the
free
men
this
messenger
from
the
outer
life
was
scarcely
less
welcome
there
was
not
a
man
on
the
island
who
did
not
feel
his
heart
grow
heavier
when
her
white
sails
disappeared
behind
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
on
the
present
occasion
business
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
had
procured
for
major
vickers
this
pleasurable
excitement
it
had
been
resolved
by
governor
arthur
that
the
convict
establishment
should
be
broken
up
a
succession
of
murders
and
attempted
escapes
had
called
public
attention
to
the
place
and
its
distance
from
hobart
town
rendered
it
inconvenient
and
expensive
arthur
had
fixed
upon
peninsula
the
earring
of
which
we
have
spoken
as
a
future
convict
depôt
and
naming
it
port
arthur
in
honour
of
himself
had
sent
down
lieutenant
maurice
frere
with
instructions
for
vickers
to
convey
the
prisoners
of
macquarie
harbour
thither
in
order
to
understand
the
magnitude
and
meaning
of
such
an
order
as
that
with
which
lieutenant
frere
was
entrusted
we
must
glance
at
the
social
condition
of
the
penal
colony
at
this
period
of
its
history
nine
years
before
colonel
arthur
late
governor
of
honduras
had
arrived
at
a
most
critical
moment
the
former
governor
colonel
sorrell
was
a
man
of
genial
temperament
but
little
strength
of
character
he
was
moreover
profligate
in
his
private
life
and
encouraged
by
his
example
his
officers
violated
all
rules
of
social
decency
it
was
common
for
an
officer
to
openly
keep
a
female
convict
as
his
mistress
not
only
would
compliance
purchase
comforts
but
strange
stories
were
afloat
concerning
the
persecution
of
women
who
dared
to
choose
their
own
lovers
to
put
down
this
profligacy
was
the
first
care
of
arthur
and
in
enforcing
a
severe
attention
to
etiquette
and
outward
respectability
he
perhaps
erred
on
the
side
of
virtue
honest
brave
and
he
was
also
penurious
and
cold
and
the
ostentatious
good
humour
of
the
colonists
dashed
itself
in
vain
against
his
polite
indifference
in
opposition
to
this
official
society
created
by
governor
arthur
was
that
of
the
free
settlers
and
the
men
the
latter
were
more
numerous
than
one
would
be
apt
to
suppose
on
the
november
free
pardons
and
conditional
pardons
appeared
on
the
books
and
the
number
of
persons
holding
on
the
of
september
the
same
year
was
seven
hundred
and
of
the
social
condition
of
these
people
at
this
time
it
is
impossible
to
speak
without
astonishment
according
to
the
recorded
testimony
of
many
respectable
officials
military
officers
and
free
profligacy
of
the
settlers
was
notorious
drunkenness
was
a
prevailing
vice
even
children
were
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
intoxicated
on
sundays
men
and
women
might
be
observed
standing
round
the
doors
waiting
for
the
expiration
of
the
hours
of
public
worship
in
order
to
continue
their
carousing
as
for
the
condition
of
the
prisoner
population
that
indeed
is
indescribable
notwithstanding
the
severe
punishment
for
sly
it
was
carried
on
to
a
large
extent
men
and
women
were
found
intoxicated
together
and
a
bottle
of
brandy
was
considered
to
be
cheaply
bought
at
the
price
of
twenty
lashes
in
the
factory
a
prison
for
females
the
vilest
abuses
were
committed
while
the
infamies
current
as
matters
of
course
in
chain
gangs
and
penal
settlements
were
of
too
horrible
a
nature
to
be
more
than
hinted
at
here
all
that
the
vilest
and
most
bestial
of
human
creatures
could
invent
and
practise
was
in
this
unhappy
country
invented
and
practised
without
restraint
and
without
shame
seven
classes
of
criminals
were
established
in
when
the
new
barracks
for
prisoners
at
hobart
town
were
finished
the
first
class
were
allowed
to
sleep
out
of
barracks
and
to
work
for
themselves
on
saturday
the
second
had
only
the
indulgence
the
third
were
only
allowed
saturday
afternoon
the
fourth
and
fifth
were
refractory
and
disorderly
characters
to
work
in
irons
the
sixth
were
men
of
the
most
degraded
and
incorrigible
character
to
be
worked
in
irons
and
kept
entirely
separate
from
the
other
prisoners
while
the
seventh
were
the
refuse
of
this
refuse
the
murderers
bandits
and
villains
whom
neither
chain
nor
lash
could
tame
they
were
regarded
as
socially
dead
and
shipped
to
hell
gates
or
maria
island
hells
gates
was
the
most
dreaded
of
all
these
houses
of
bondage
the
discipline
at
the
place
was
so
severe
and
the
life
so
terrible
that
prisoners
would
risk
all
to
escape
from
it
in
one
year
of
deaths
there
only
thirty
were
from
natural
causes
of
the
remaining
dead
were
drowned
eight
killed
accidentally
three
shot
by
the
soldiers
and
twelve
murdered
by
their
comrades
in
one
hundred
and
men
out
of
one
hundred
and
were
punished
to
the
extent
of
two
thousand
lashes
during
the
ten
years
of
its
existence
one
hundred
and
twelve
men
escaped
out
of
whom
only
were
the
prisoners
killed
themselves
to
avoid
living
any
longer
and
if
so
fortunate
as
to
penetrate
the
desert
of
scrub
heath
and
swamp
which
lay
between
their
prison
and
the
settled
districts
preferred
death
to
recapture
successfully
to
transport
the
remnant
of
this
desperate
band
of
felons
to
arthur
new
prison
was
the
mission
of
maurice
frere
he
was
sitting
by
the
empty
with
one
leg
carelessly
thrown
over
the
other
entertaining
the
company
with
his
usual
indifferent
air
the
six
years
that
had
passed
since
his
departure
from
england
had
given
him
a
sturdier
frame
and
a
fuller
face
his
hair
was
coarser
his
face
redder
and
his
eye
more
hard
but
in
demeanour
he
was
little
changed
sobered
he
might
be
and
his
voice
had
acquired
that
decisive
insured
tone
which
a
voice
exercised
only
in
accents
of
command
invariably
acquires
but
his
bad
qualities
were
as
prominent
as
ever
his
five
years
residence
at
maria
island
had
increased
that
brutality
of
thought
and
overbearing
confidence
in
his
own
importance
for
which
he
had
been
always
remarkable
but
it
had
also
given
him
an
assured
air
of
authority
which
covered
the
more
unpleasant
features
of
his
character
he
was
detested
by
the
prisoners
as
he
said
it
was
a
word
and
a
blow
with
him
but
among
his
superiors
he
passed
for
an
officer
honest
and
painstaking
though
somewhat
bluff
and
severe
well
vickers
he
said
as
he
took
a
cup
of
tea
from
the
hands
of
that
lady
i
suppose
you
wo
be
sorry
to
get
away
from
this
place
eh
trouble
you
for
the
toast
vickers
no
indeed
says
poor
vickers
with
the
old
girlishness
shadowed
by
six
years
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
a
dreadful
place
duties
however
are
imperative
but
the
wind
my
dear
frere
no
idea
of
it
i
wanted
to
send
sylvia
to
hobart
town
but
john
would
not
let
her
by
the
way
how
is
miss
sylvia
asked
frere
with
the
patronising
air
which
men
of
his
stamp
adopt
when
they
speak
of
children
not
very
well
i
sorry
to
say
returned
vickers
you
see
lonely
for
her
here
there
are
no
children
of
her
own
age
with
the
exception
of
the
pilot
little
girl
and
she
can
not
associate
with
her
but
i
did
not
like
to
leave
her
behind
and
endeavoured
to
teach
her
hum
there
was
or
something
was
there
not
said
frere
staring
into
his
that
maid
you
know
what
was
her
name
miss
purfoy
said
vickers
a
little
gravely
yes
poor
thing
a
sad
story
frere
eye
twinkled
indeed
i
left
you
know
shortly
after
the
trial
of
the
mutineers
and
never
heard
the
full
he
spoke
carelessly
but
he
awaited
the
reply
with
keen
curiosity
a
sad
story
repeated
vickers
she
was
the
wife
of
that
wretched
man
rex
and
came
out
as
my
maid
in
order
to
be
near
him
she
would
never
tell
me
her
history
poor
thing
though
all
through
the
dreadful
accusations
made
by
that
horrid
doctor
i
always
disliked
that
man
i
begged
her
almost
on
my
knees
you
know
how
she
nursed
sylvia
and
poor
john
really
a
most
superior
creature
i
think
she
must
have
been
a
frere
raised
his
eyebrows
abruptly
as
though
he
would
say
governess
of
course
happy
suggestion
wonder
it
never
occurred
to
me
before
however
her
conduct
was
most
exemplary
really
most
exemplary
and
during
the
six
months
we
were
in
hobart
town
she
taught
little
sylvia
a
great
deal
of
course
she
could
not
help
her
wretched
husband
you
know
could
she
certainly
not
said
frere
heartily
i
heard
something
about
him
too
got
into
some
scrape
did
he
not
half
a
cup
miss
purfoy
or
rex
as
she
really
was
though
i
do
suppose
rex
is
her
real
name
either
sugar
and
milk
i
think
you
said
came
into
a
little
legacy
from
an
old
aunt
in
frere
gave
a
little
bluff
nod
meaning
thereby
old
aunt
exactly
just
what
might
have
been
expected
and
left
my
service
she
took
a
little
cottage
on
the
new
town
road
and
rex
was
assigned
to
her
as
her
i
see
the
old
dodge
says
frere
flushing
a
little
well
well
the
wretched
man
tried
to
escape
and
she
helped
him
he
was
to
get
to
launceston
and
so
on
board
a
vessel
to
sydney
but
they
took
the
unhappy
creature
and
he
was
sent
down
here
she
was
only
fined
but
it
ruined
ruined
her
well
you
see
only
a
few
people
knew
of
her
relationship
to
rex
and
she
was
rather
respected
of
course
when
it
became
known
what
with
that
dreadful
trial
and
the
horrible
assertions
of
pine
you
will
not
believe
me
i
know
there
was
something
about
that
man
i
never
liked
she
was
quite
left
alone
she
wanted
me
to
bring
her
down
here
to
teach
sylvia
but
john
thought
that
it
was
only
to
be
near
her
husband
and
would
allow
of
course
it
was
said
vickers
rising
frere
if
you
like
to
smoke
we
go
on
the
she
will
never
be
satisfied
until
she
gets
that
scoundrel
he
a
bad
lot
then
says
frere
opening
the
glass
window
and
leading
the
way
to
the
sandy
garden
you
will
excuse
my
roughness
vickers
but
i
have
become
quite
a
slave
to
my
pipe
ha
ha
it
wife
and
child
to
me
oh
a
very
bad
lot
returned
vickers
quiet
and
silent
but
ready
for
any
villainy
i
count
him
one
of
the
worst
men
we
have
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
more
i
think
he
is
the
why
do
you
flog
says
frere
lighting
his
pipe
in
the
gloom
by
george
sir
i
cut
the
hides
off
my
fellows
if
they
show
any
nonsense
well
says
vickers
i
do
care
about
too
much
cat
myself
barton
who
was
here
before
me
flogged
tremendously
but
i
do
think
it
did
any
good
they
tried
to
kill
him
several
times
you
remember
those
twelve
fellows
who
were
hung
no
ah
of
course
you
were
what
do
you
do
with
oh
flog
the
worst
you
know
but
i
do
flog
more
than
a
man
a
week
as
a
rule
and
never
more
than
fifty
lashes
they
getting
quieter
now
then
we
iron
and
and
maroon
do
what
give
them
solitary
confinement
on
grummet
island
when
a
man
gets
very
bad
we
clap
him
into
a
boat
with
a
week
provisions
and
pull
him
over
to
grummet
there
are
cells
cut
in
the
rock
you
see
and
the
fellow
pulls
up
his
commissariat
after
him
and
lives
there
by
himself
for
a
month
or
so
it
tames
them
does
it
said
frere
by
jove
it
a
capital
notion
i
wish
i
had
a
place
of
that
sort
at
i
a
fellow
there
now
says
vickers
dawes
you
remember
him
of
course
the
ringleader
of
the
mutiny
in
the
malabar
a
dreadful
ruffian
he
was
most
violent
the
first
year
i
was
here
barton
used
to
flog
a
good
deal
and
dawes
had
a
childish
dread
of
the
cat
when
i
came
in
when
was
it
in
he
made
a
sort
of
petition
to
be
sent
back
to
the
settlement
said
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
mutiny
and
that
the
accusation
against
him
was
the
old
dodge
said
frere
again
a
match
of
course
i
could
let
him
go
but
i
took
him
out
of
the
and
put
him
on
the
osprey
you
saw
her
in
the
dock
as
you
came
in
he
worked
for
some
time
very
well
and
then
tried
to
bolt
the
old
trick
ha
ha
do
i
know
it
says
frere
emitting
a
streak
of
smoke
in
the
air
expressive
of
preternatural
wisdom
well
we
caught
him
and
gave
him
fifty
then
he
was
sent
to
the
cutting
timber
then
we
put
him
into
the
boats
but
he
quarrelled
with
the
coxswain
and
then
we
took
him
back
to
the
about
six
weeks
ago
he
made
another
attempt
together
with
gabbett
the
man
who
nearly
killed
you
but
his
leg
was
chafed
with
the
irons
and
we
took
him
gabbett
and
three
more
however
got
have
you
found
asked
frere
puffing
at
his
pipe
no
but
they
come
to
the
same
fate
as
the
rest
said
vickers
with
a
sort
of
dismal
pride
no
man
ever
escaped
from
macquarie
frere
laughed
by
the
lord
said
he
it
will
be
rather
hard
for
if
they
do
come
back
before
the
end
of
the
month
eh
oh
said
vickers
they
sure
to
come
if
they
can
come
at
all
but
once
lost
in
the
scrub
a
man
has
much
chance
for
his
when
do
you
think
you
will
be
ready
to
move
asked
frere
as
soon
as
you
wish
i
do
want
to
stop
a
moment
longer
than
i
can
help
it
is
a
terrible
life
do
you
think
so
asked
his
companion
in
unaffected
surprise
i
like
it
it
dull
certainly
when
i
first
went
to
maria
i
was
dreadfully
bored
but
one
soon
gets
used
to
it
there
is
a
sort
of
satisfaction
to
me
by
george
in
keeping
the
scoundrels
in
order
i
like
to
see
the
fellows
eyes
glint
at
you
as
you
walk
past
gad
they
tear
me
to
pieces
if
they
dared
some
of
and
he
laughed
grimly
as
though
the
hate
he
inspired
was
a
thing
to
be
proud
of
how
shall
we
go
asked
vickers
have
you
got
any
instructions
no
says
frere
it
all
left
to
you
get
up
the
best
way
you
can
arthur
said
and
pack
off
to
the
new
peninsula
he
thinks
you
too
far
off
here
by
george
he
wants
to
have
you
within
it
dangerous
taking
so
many
at
once
suggested
vickers
not
a
bit
batten
down
and
keep
the
sentries
awake
and
they
do
any
but
vickers
and
the
child
i
thought
of
that
you
take
the
ladybird
with
the
prisoners
and
leave
me
to
bring
up
vickers
in
the
we
might
do
that
indeed
it
the
best
way
i
think
i
do
like
the
notion
of
having
sylvia
among
those
wretches
and
yet
i
do
like
to
leave
well
says
frere
confident
of
his
own
ability
to
accomplish
anything
he
might
undertake
i
take
the
ladybird
and
you
the
osprey
bring
up
vickers
no
no
said
vickers
with
a
touch
of
his
old
pomposity
that
do
by
the
king
regulations
all
right
interjected
frere
you
need
quote
officer
commanding
is
obliged
to
place
himself
in
charge
all
right
my
dear
sir
i
no
objection
in
it
was
sylvia
that
i
was
thinking
of
said
vickers
well
then
cries
the
other
as
the
door
of
the
room
inside
opened
and
a
little
white
figure
came
through
into
the
broad
verandah
here
she
is
ask
her
yourself
well
miss
sylvia
will
you
come
and
shake
hands
with
an
old
friend
the
baby
of
the
malabar
had
become
a
child
of
some
eleven
years
old
and
as
she
stood
in
her
simple
white
dress
in
the
glow
of
the
lamplight
even
the
unaesthetic
mind
of
frere
was
struck
by
her
extreme
beauty
her
bright
blue
eyes
were
as
bright
and
as
blue
as
ever
her
little
figure
was
as
upright
and
as
supple
as
a
willow
rod
and
her
innocent
delicate
face
was
framed
in
a
nimbus
of
that
fine
golden
hair
dry
and
electrical
each
separate
thread
shining
with
a
lustre
of
its
own
with
which
the
dreaming
painters
of
the
middle
ages
endowed
and
glorified
their
angels
come
and
give
me
a
kiss
miss
sylvia
cries
frere
you
forgotten
me
have
you
but
the
child
resting
one
hand
on
her
father
knee
surveyed
frere
from
head
to
foot
with
the
charming
impertinence
of
childhood
and
then
shaking
her
head
inquired
who
is
he
papa
mr
frere
darling
do
you
remember
frere
who
used
to
play
ball
with
you
on
board
the
ship
and
who
was
so
kind
to
you
when
you
were
getting
well
for
shame
sylvia
there
was
in
the
chiding
accents
such
an
undertone
of
tenderness
that
the
reproof
fell
harmless
i
remember
you
said
sylvia
tossing
her
head
but
you
were
nicer
then
than
you
are
now
i
do
like
you
at
you
do
remember
me
said
frere
a
little
disconcerted
and
affecting
to
be
intensely
at
his
ease
i
am
sure
you
do
what
is
my
name
lieutenant
frere
you
knocked
down
a
prisoner
who
picked
up
my
ball
i
do
like
you
a
forward
young
lady
upon
my
word
said
frere
with
a
great
laugh
ha
ha
so
i
did
begad
i
recollect
now
what
a
memory
got
he
here
now
is
he
papa
went
on
sylvia
regardless
of
interruption
rufus
dawes
is
his
name
and
he
always
in
trouble
poor
fellow
i
sorry
for
him
danny
says
he
queer
in
his
and
who
danny
asked
frere
with
another
laugh
the
cook
replied
vickers
an
old
man
i
took
out
of
hospital
sylvia
you
talk
too
much
with
the
prisoners
i
have
forbidden
you
once
or
twice
but
danny
is
not
a
prisoner
papa
he
a
cook
says
sylvia
nothing
abashed
and
he
a
clever
man
he
told
me
all
about
london
where
the
lord
mayor
rides
in
a
glass
coach
and
all
the
work
is
done
by
free
men
he
says
you
never
hear
chains
there
i
should
like
to
see
london
papa
so
would
danny
i
have
no
doubt
said
frere
no
he
did
say
that
but
he
wants
to
see
his
old
mother
he
says
fancy
danny
mother
what
an
ugly
old
woman
she
must
be
he
says
see
her
in
heaven
will
he
papa
i
hope
so
my
papa
will
danny
wear
his
yellow
jacket
in
heaven
or
go
as
a
free
man
frere
burst
into
a
roar
at
this
you
an
impertinent
fellow
sir
cried
sylvia
her
bright
eyes
flashing
how
dare
you
laugh
at
me
if
i
was
papa
i
give
you
half
an
hour
at
the
triangles
oh
you
impertinent
man
and
crimson
with
rage
the
spoilt
little
beauty
ran
out
of
the
room
vickers
looked
grave
but
frere
was
constrained
to
get
up
to
laugh
at
his
ease
good
honour
that
good
the
little
vixen
half
an
hour
at
the
triangles
ha
ha
ha
she
is
a
strange
child
said
vickers
and
talks
strangely
for
her
age
but
you
must
mind
her
she
is
neither
girl
nor
woman
you
see
and
her
education
has
been
neglected
moreover
this
gloomy
place
and
its
associations
what
can
you
expect
from
a
child
bred
in
a
convict
settlement
my
dear
sir
says
the
other
she
delightful
her
innocence
of
the
world
is
amazing
she
must
have
three
or
four
years
at
a
good
finishing
school
at
sydney
please
god
i
will
give
them
to
her
when
we
go
back
or
send
her
to
england
if
i
can
she
is
a
girl
but
she
wants
polishing
sadly
i
just
then
someone
came
up
the
garden
path
and
saluted
what
is
it
troke
prisoner
given
himself
up
which
of
them
gabbett
he
came
back
alone
yes
sir
the
rest
have
died
he
what
that
asked
frere
suddenly
interested
the
bolter
i
was
telling
you
about
gabbett
your
old
friend
how
long
has
he
been
out
nigh
six
weeks
sir
said
the
constable
touching
his
cap
gad
he
had
a
narrow
squeak
for
it
i
be
bound
i
should
like
to
see
he
down
at
the
sheds
said
the
ready
troke
a
burglar
you
can
see
him
at
once
gentlemen
if
you
what
do
you
say
vickers
oh
by
all
chapter
iv
the
bolter
it
was
not
far
to
the
sheds
and
after
a
few
minutes
walk
through
the
wooden
palisades
they
reached
a
long
stone
building
two
storeys
high
from
which
issued
a
horrible
growling
pierced
with
shrilly
screamed
songs
at
the
sound
of
the
musket
butts
clashing
on
the
flagging
the
noises
ceased
and
a
silence
more
sinister
than
sound
fell
on
the
place
passing
between
two
rows
of
warders
the
two
officers
reached
a
sort
of
to
the
gaol
containing
a
stretcher
on
which
a
mass
of
something
was
lying
on
a
stool
by
the
side
of
this
stretcher
sat
a
man
in
the
grey
dress
worn
as
a
contrast
to
the
yellow
livery
of
good
conduct
prisoners
this
man
held
between
his
knees
a
basin
containing
gruel
and
was
apparently
endeavouring
to
feed
the
mass
on
the
pine
logs
wo
he
eat
steve
asked
vickers
and
at
the
sound
of
the
commandant
voice
steve
arose
dunno
what
wrong
wi
sir
he
said
jerking
up
a
finger
to
his
forehead
he
seems
jest
i
ca
do
nothin
wi
gabbett
the
intelligent
troke
considerately
alive
to
the
wishes
of
his
superior
officers
dragged
the
mass
into
a
sitting
posture
gabbett
for
it
was
he
passed
one
great
hand
over
his
face
and
leaning
exactly
in
the
position
in
which
troke
placed
him
scowled
bewildered
at
his
visitors
well
gabbett
says
vickers
you
come
back
again
you
see
when
will
you
learn
sense
eh
where
are
your
mates
the
giant
did
not
reply
do
you
hear
me
where
are
your
mates
where
are
your
mates
repeated
troke
dead
says
gabbett
all
three
of
them
and
how
did
you
get
back
gabbett
in
eloquent
silence
held
out
a
bleeding
foot
we
found
him
on
the
point
sir
said
troke
jauntily
explaining
and
brought
him
across
in
the
boat
he
had
a
basin
of
gruel
but
he
seem
are
you
hungry
why
do
you
eat
your
gruel
gabbett
curled
his
great
lips
i
have
eaten
it
ai
yer
got
nuffin
better
nor
that
to
flog
a
man
on
ugh
yer
a
mean
lot
wot
it
to
be
this
time
major
fifty
and
laughing
he
rolled
down
again
on
the
logs
a
nice
specimen
said
vickers
with
a
hopeless
smile
what
can
one
do
with
such
a
fellow
i
flog
his
soul
out
of
his
body
said
frere
if
he
spoke
to
me
like
that
troke
and
the
others
hearing
the
statement
conceived
an
instant
respect
for
the
he
looked
as
if
he
would
keep
his
word
the
giant
raised
his
great
head
and
looked
at
the
speaker
but
did
not
recognize
him
he
saw
only
a
strange
face
a
visitor
perhaps
you
may
flog
and
welcome
master
said
he
if
you
give
me
a
fig
frere
laughed
the
brutal
indifference
of
the
rejoinder
suited
his
humour
and
with
a
glance
at
vickers
he
took
a
small
piece
of
cavendish
from
the
pocket
of
his
and
gave
it
to
the
recaptured
convict
gabbett
snatched
it
as
a
cur
snatches
at
a
bone
and
thrust
it
whole
into
his
mouth
how
many
mates
had
he
asked
maurice
watching
the
champing
jaws
as
one
looks
at
a
strange
animal
and
asking
the
question
as
though
a
mate
was
something
a
convict
was
born
with
like
a
mole
for
instance
three
three
eh
well
give
him
thirty
lashes
and
if
i
ha
had
three
more
growled
gabbett
mumbling
at
his
tobacco
you
would
ha
had
the
what
does
he
say
but
troke
had
not
heard
and
the
man
shrinking
as
it
seemed
slightly
from
the
prisoner
said
he
had
not
heard
either
the
wretch
himself
munching
hard
at
his
tobacco
relapsed
into
his
restless
silence
and
was
as
though
he
had
never
spoken
as
he
sat
there
gloomily
chewing
he
was
a
spectacle
to
shudder
at
not
so
much
on
account
of
his
natural
hideousness
increased
a
by
the
tattered
and
filthy
rags
which
barely
covered
him
not
so
much
on
account
of
his
unshaven
jaws
his
his
torn
and
bleeding
feet
his
haggard
cheeks
and
his
huge
wasted
frame
not
only
because
looking
at
the
animal
as
he
crouched
with
one
foot
curled
round
the
other
and
one
hairy
arm
pendant
between
his
knees
he
was
so
horribly
unhuman
that
one
shuddered
to
think
that
tender
women
and
fair
children
must
of
necessity
confess
to
fellowship
of
kind
with
such
a
monster
but
also
because
in
his
slavering
mouth
his
slowly
grinding
jaws
his
restless
fingers
and
his
bloodshot
wandering
eyes
there
lurked
a
hint
of
some
terror
more
awful
than
the
terror
of
starvation
a
memory
of
a
tragedy
played
out
in
the
gloomy
depths
of
that
forest
which
had
vomited
him
forth
again
and
the
shadow
of
this
unknown
horror
clinging
to
him
repelled
and
disgusted
as
though
he
bore
about
with
him
the
reek
of
the
shambles
come
said
vickers
let
us
go
back
i
shall
have
to
flog
him
again
i
suppose
oh
this
place
no
wonder
they
call
it
you
are
too
my
dear
sir
said
frere
up
the
palisaded
path
we
must
treat
brutes
like
major
vickers
inured
as
he
was
to
such
sentiments
sighed
it
is
not
for
me
to
find
fault
with
the
system
he
said
hesitating
in
his
reverence
for
discipline
to
utter
all
the
thought
but
i
have
sometimes
wondered
if
kindness
would
not
succeed
better
than
the
chain
and
the
your
old
ideas
laughed
his
companion
remember
they
nearly
cost
us
our
lives
on
the
malabar
no
no
i
seen
something
of
convicts
though
to
be
sure
my
fellows
were
not
so
bad
as
yours
and
there
only
one
way
keep
down
sir
make
feel
what
they
are
they
there
to
work
sir
if
they
wo
work
flog
until
they
will
if
they
work
well
why
a
taste
of
the
cat
now
and
then
keeps
in
mind
of
what
they
may
expect
if
they
get
they
had
reached
the
verandah
now
the
rising
moon
shone
softly
on
the
bay
beneath
them
and
touched
with
her
white
light
the
summit
of
the
grummet
rock
that
is
the
general
opinion
i
know
returned
vickers
but
consider
the
life
they
lead
good
god
he
added
with
sudden
vehemence
as
frere
paused
to
look
at
the
bay
i
not
a
cruel
man
and
never
i
believe
inflicted
an
unmerited
punishment
but
since
i
have
been
here
ten
prisoners
have
drowned
themselves
from
yonder
rock
rather
than
live
on
in
their
misery
only
three
weeks
ago
two
men
with
a
party
in
the
hills
having
had
some
words
with
the
overseer
shook
hands
with
the
gang
and
then
hand
in
hand
flung
themselves
over
the
cliff
it
horrible
to
think
of
they
should
get
sent
here
said
practical
frere
they
knew
what
they
had
to
expect
serve
but
imagine
an
innocent
man
condemned
to
this
place
i
ca
said
frere
with
a
laugh
innocent
man
be
hanged
all
innocent
if
you
believe
their
own
stories
hallo
what
that
red
light
there
dawes
fire
on
grummet
rock
says
vickers
going
in
the
man
i
told
you
about
come
in
and
have
some
and
we
shut
the
door
in
chapter
sylvia
well
said
frere
as
they
went
in
you
be
out
of
it
soon
you
can
get
all
ready
to
start
by
the
end
of
the
month
and
i
bring
on
vickers
what
is
that
you
say
about
me
asked
the
sprightly
vickers
from
within
you
wicked
men
leaving
me
alone
all
this
time
mr
frere
has
kindly
offered
to
bring
you
and
sylvia
after
us
in
the
osprey
i
shall
of
course
have
to
take
the
you
are
most
kind
frere
really
you
are
says
vickers
a
recollection
of
her
flirtation
with
a
certain
young
lieutenant
six
years
before
tinging
her
cheeks
it
is
really
most
considerate
of
you
wo
it
be
nice
sylvia
to
go
with
frere
and
mamma
to
hobart
town
mr
frere
says
sylvia
coming
from
out
a
corner
of
the
room
i
am
very
sorry
for
what
i
said
just
now
will
you
forgive
me
she
asked
the
question
in
such
a
prim
way
standing
in
front
of
him
with
her
golden
locks
streaming
over
her
shoulders
and
her
hands
clasped
on
her
black
silk
apron
julia
vickers
had
her
own
notions
about
dressing
her
daughter
that
frere
was
again
inclined
to
laugh
of
course
i
forgive
you
my
dear
he
said
you
did
mean
it
i
oh
but
i
did
mean
it
and
that
why
i
sorry
i
am
a
very
naughty
girl
sometimes
though
you
would
think
so
this
with
a
charming
consciousness
of
her
own
beauty
especially
with
roman
history
i
do
think
the
romans
were
half
as
brave
as
the
carthaginians
do
you
frere
maurice
somewhat
staggered
by
this
question
could
only
ask
why
not
well
i
do
like
them
half
so
well
myself
says
sylvia
with
feminine
disdain
of
reasons
they
always
had
so
many
soldiers
though
the
others
were
so
cruel
when
they
were
they
says
frere
were
they
goodness
gracious
yes
did
they
cut
poor
eyelids
off
and
roll
him
down
hill
in
a
barrel
full
of
nails
what
do
you
call
that
i
should
like
to
know
and
frere
shaking
his
red
head
with
vast
assumption
of
classical
learning
could
not
but
concede
that
that
was
not
kind
on
the
part
of
the
carthaginians
you
are
a
great
scholar
miss
sylvia
he
remarked
with
a
consciousness
that
this
girl
was
rapidly
taking
him
out
of
his
depth
are
you
fond
of
reading
and
what
books
do
you
read
oh
lots
and
virginia
and
lost
and
plays
and
crusoe
and
sermons
and
tasmanian
almanack
and
book
of
beauty
and
a
somewhat
miscellaneous
collection
i
fear
said
vickers
with
a
sickly
smile
she
like
gallio
cared
for
none
of
these
things
but
our
little
library
is
necessarily
limited
and
i
am
not
a
great
reader
john
my
dear
frere
would
like
another
glass
of
oh
do
apologize
i
am
a
soldier
wife
you
know
sylvia
my
love
say
to
frere
and
miss
sylvia
will
you
give
me
a
kiss
no
sylvia
do
be
rude
i
not
rude
cries
sylvia
indignant
at
the
way
in
which
her
literary
confidence
had
been
received
he
rude
i
wo
kiss
you
kiss
you
indeed
my
goodness
gracious
wo
you
you
little
beauty
cried
frere
suddenly
leaning
forward
and
putting
his
arm
round
the
child
then
i
must
kiss
you
to
his
astonishment
sylvia
finding
herself
thus
seized
and
kissed
despite
herself
flushed
scarlet
and
lifting
up
her
tiny
fist
struck
him
on
the
cheek
with
all
her
force
the
blow
was
so
sudden
and
the
momentary
pain
so
sharp
that
maurice
nearly
slipped
into
his
native
coarseness
and
rapped
out
an
oath
my
dear
sylvia
cried
vickers
in
tones
of
grave
reproof
but
frere
laughed
caught
both
the
child
hands
in
one
of
his
own
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
despite
her
struggles
there
he
said
with
a
sort
of
triumph
in
his
tone
you
got
nothing
by
that
you
vickers
rose
with
annoyance
visible
on
his
face
to
draw
the
child
away
and
as
he
did
so
she
gasping
for
breath
and
sobbing
with
rage
wrenched
her
wrist
free
and
in
a
storm
of
childish
passion
struck
her
tormentor
again
and
again
man
she
cried
with
flaming
eyes
let
me
go
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
i
am
very
sorry
for
this
frere
said
vickers
when
the
door
was
closed
again
i
hope
she
did
not
hurt
not
she
i
like
her
spirit
ha
ha
that
the
way
with
women
all
the
world
over
nothing
like
showing
them
that
they
got
a
vickers
hastened
to
turn
the
conversation
and
amid
recollections
of
old
days
and
speculations
as
to
future
prospects
the
little
incident
was
forgotten
but
when
an
hour
later
frere
traversed
the
passage
that
led
to
his
bedroom
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
little
figure
wrapped
in
a
shawl
it
was
his
childish
enemy
i
waited
for
you
frere
said
she
to
beg
pardon
i
ought
not
to
have
struck
you
i
am
a
wicked
girl
do
say
no
because
i
am
and
if
i
do
grow
better
i
shall
never
go
to
thus
addressing
him
the
child
produced
a
piece
of
paper
folded
like
a
letter
from
beneath
the
shawl
and
handed
it
to
him
what
this
he
asked
go
back
to
bed
my
dear
you
catch
it
a
written
apology
and
i
catch
cold
because
i
got
my
stockings
on
if
you
do
accept
it
she
added
with
an
arching
of
the
brows
it
is
not
my
fault
i
have
struck
you
but
i
apologize
being
a
woman
i
ca
offer
you
satisfaction
in
the
usual
frere
stifled
the
impulse
to
laugh
and
made
his
courteous
adversary
a
low
bow
i
accept
your
apology
miss
sylvia
said
he
then
returned
miss
sylvia
in
a
lofty
manner
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
and
i
have
the
honour
to
bid
you
the
little
maiden
drew
her
shawl
close
around
her
with
immense
dignity
and
marched
down
the
passage
as
calmly
as
though
she
had
been
amadis
of
gaul
himself
frere
gaining
his
room
choking
with
laughter
opened
the
folded
paper
by
the
light
of
the
tallow
candle
and
read
in
a
quaint
childish
hand
sir
i
have
struck
you
i
apologize
in
writing
your
humble
servant
to
command
sylvia
vickers
i
wonder
what
book
she
took
that
out
of
he
said
my
word
she
must
be
a
little
cracked
it
a
queer
life
for
a
child
in
this
place
and
no
chapter
vi
a
leap
in
the
dark
two
or
three
mornings
after
the
arrival
of
the
ladybird
the
solitary
prisoner
of
the
grummet
rock
noticed
mysterious
movements
along
the
shore
of
the
island
settlement
the
prison
boats
which
had
put
off
every
morning
at
sunrise
to
the
foot
of
the
timbered
ranges
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
had
not
appeared
for
some
days
the
building
of
a
pier
or
breakwater
running
from
the
western
point
of
the
settlement
was
discontinued
and
all
hands
appeared
to
be
occupied
with
the
osprey
which
was
lying
on
the
slips
parties
of
soldiers
also
daily
left
the
ladybird
and
assisted
at
the
mysterious
work
in
progress
rufus
dawes
walking
his
little
round
each
day
in
vain
wondered
what
this
unusual
commotion
portended
unfortunately
no
one
came
to
enlighten
his
ignorance
a
fortnight
after
this
about
the
of
december
he
observed
another
curious
fact
all
the
boats
on
the
island
put
off
one
morning
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
harbour
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
a
great
smoke
arose
along
the
side
of
the
hills
the
next
day
the
same
was
repeated
and
on
the
fourth
day
the
boats
returned
towing
behind
them
a
huge
raft
this
raft
made
fast
to
the
side
of
the
ladybird
proved
to
be
composed
of
planks
beams
and
joists
all
of
which
were
duly
hoisted
up
and
stowed
in
the
hold
of
the
brig
this
set
rufus
dawes
thinking
could
it
possibly
be
that
the
was
to
be
abandoned
and
that
the
government
had
hit
upon
some
other
method
of
utilizing
its
convict
labour
he
had
hewn
timber
and
built
boats
and
tanned
hides
and
made
shoes
was
it
possible
that
some
new
trade
was
to
be
initiated
before
he
had
settled
this
point
to
his
satisfaction
he
was
startled
by
another
boat
expedition
three
boats
crews
went
down
the
bay
and
returned
after
a
day
absence
with
an
addition
to
their
number
in
the
shape
of
four
strangers
and
a
quantity
of
stores
and
farming
implements
rufus
dawes
catching
sight
of
these
last
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
boats
had
been
to
philip
island
where
the
garden
was
established
and
had
taken
off
the
gardeners
and
garden
produce
rufus
dawes
decided
that
the
ladybird
had
brought
a
new
commandant
his
sight
trained
by
his
life
had
already
distinguished
maurice
frere
and
that
these
mysteries
were
improvements
under
the
new
rule
when
he
arrived
at
this
point
of
reasoning
another
conjecture
assuming
his
first
to
have
been
correct
followed
as
a
natural
consequence
lieutenant
frere
would
be
a
more
severe
commandant
than
major
vickers
now
severity
had
already
reached
its
height
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
so
the
unhappy
man
took
a
final
resolution
he
would
kill
himself
before
we
exclaim
against
the
sin
of
such
a
determination
let
us
endeavour
to
set
before
us
what
the
sinner
had
suffered
during
the
past
six
years
we
have
already
a
notion
of
what
life
on
a
convict
ship
means
and
we
have
seen
through
what
a
furnace
rufus
dawes
had
passed
before
he
set
foot
on
the
barren
shore
of
hell
gates
but
to
appreciate
in
its
intensity
the
agony
he
suffered
since
that
time
we
must
multiply
the
infamy
of
the
decks
of
the
malabar
a
hundred
fold
in
that
prison
was
at
least
some
ray
of
light
all
were
not
abominable
all
were
not
utterly
lost
to
shame
and
manhood
stifling
though
the
prison
infamous
the
companionship
terrible
the
memory
of
past
happiness
there
was
yet
ignorance
of
the
future
there
was
yet
hope
but
at
macquarie
harbour
was
poured
out
the
very
dregs
of
this
cup
of
desolation
the
worst
had
come
and
the
worst
must
for
ever
remain
the
pit
of
torment
was
so
deep
that
one
could
not
even
see
heaven
there
was
no
hope
there
so
long
as
life
remained
death
alone
kept
the
keys
of
that
island
prison
is
it
possible
to
imagine
even
for
a
moment
what
an
innocent
man
gifted
with
ambition
endowed
with
power
to
love
and
to
respect
must
have
suffered
during
one
week
of
such
punishment
we
ordinary
men
leading
ordinary
lives
walking
riding
laughing
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
can
form
no
notion
of
such
misery
as
this
some
dim
ideas
we
may
have
about
the
sweetness
of
liberty
and
the
loathing
that
evil
company
inspires
but
that
is
all
we
know
that
were
we
chained
and
degraded
fed
like
dogs
employed
as
beasts
of
burden
driven
to
our
daily
toil
with
threats
and
blows
and
herded
with
wretches
among
whom
all
that
savours
of
decency
and
manliness
is
held
in
an
open
scorn
we
should
die
perhaps
or
go
mad
but
we
do
not
know
and
can
never
know
how
unutterably
loathsome
life
must
become
when
shared
with
such
beings
as
those
who
dragged
the
to
the
banks
of
the
gordon
and
toiled
blaspheming
in
their
irons
on
the
dismal
sandpit
of
sarah
island
no
human
creature
could
describe
to
what
depth
of
personal
abasement
and
one
week
of
such
a
life
would
plunge
him
even
if
he
had
the
power
to
write
he
dared
not
as
one
whom
in
a
desert
seeking
for
a
face
should
come
to
a
pool
of
blood
and
seeing
his
own
reflection
fly
so
would
such
a
one
hasten
from
the
contemplation
of
his
own
degrading
agony
imagine
such
torment
endured
for
six
years
ignorant
that
the
sights
and
sounds
about
him
were
symptoms
of
the
final
abandonment
of
the
settlement
and
that
the
ladybird
was
sent
down
to
bring
away
the
prisoners
rufus
dawes
decided
upon
getting
rid
of
that
burden
of
life
which
pressed
upon
him
so
heavily
for
six
years
he
had
hewn
wood
and
drawn
water
for
six
years
he
had
hoped
against
hope
for
six
years
he
had
lived
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
dared
not
recapitulate
to
himself
what
he
had
suffered
indeed
his
senses
were
deadened
and
dulled
by
torture
he
cared
to
remember
only
one
thing
that
he
was
a
prisoner
for
life
in
vain
had
been
his
first
dream
of
freedom
he
had
done
his
best
by
good
conduct
to
win
release
but
the
villainy
of
vetch
and
rex
had
deprived
him
of
the
fruit
of
his
labour
instead
of
gaining
credit
by
his
exposure
of
the
plot
on
board
the
malabar
he
was
himself
deemed
guilty
and
condemned
despite
his
asseverations
of
innocence
the
knowledge
of
his
treachery
for
so
it
was
deemed
among
his
associates
while
it
gained
for
him
no
credit
with
the
authorities
procured
for
him
the
detestation
and
of
the
monsters
among
whom
he
found
himself
on
his
arrival
at
hell
gates
he
was
a
marked
man
a
pariah
among
those
beings
who
were
pariahs
to
all
the
world
beside
thrice
his
life
was
attempted
but
he
was
not
then
quite
tired
of
living
and
he
defended
it
this
defence
was
construed
by
an
overseer
into
a
brawl
and
the
irons
from
which
he
had
been
relieved
were
replaced
his
strength
brute
attribute
that
alone
could
avail
him
made
him
respected
after
this
and
he
was
left
at
peace
at
first
this
treatment
was
congenial
to
his
temperament
but
by
and
by
it
became
annoying
then
painful
then
almost
unendurable
tugging
at
his
oar
digging
up
to
his
waist
in
slime
or
bending
beneath
his
burden
of
pine
wood
he
looked
greedily
for
some
excuse
to
be
addressed
he
would
take
double
weight
when
forming
part
of
the
human
caterpillar
along
whose
back
lay
a
pine
tree
for
a
word
of
fellowship
he
would
work
double
tides
to
gain
a
kindly
sentence
from
a
comrade
in
his
utter
desolation
he
agonized
for
the
friendship
of
robbers
and
murderers
then
the
reaction
came
and
he
hated
the
very
sound
of
their
voices
he
never
spoke
and
refused
to
answer
when
spoken
to
he
would
even
take
his
scanty
supper
alone
did
his
chain
so
permit
him
he
gained
the
reputation
of
a
sullen
dangerous
ruffian
captain
barton
the
superintendent
took
pity
on
him
and
made
him
his
gardener
he
accepted
the
pity
for
a
week
or
so
and
then
barton
coming
down
one
morning
found
the
few
shrubs
pulled
up
by
the
roots
the
trampled
into
barrenness
and
his
gardener
sitting
on
the
ground
among
the
fragments
of
his
gardening
tools
for
this
act
of
wanton
mischief
he
was
flogged
at
the
triangles
his
behaviour
was
considered
curious
he
wept
and
prayed
to
be
released
fell
on
his
knees
to
barton
and
implored
pardon
barton
would
not
listen
and
at
the
first
blow
the
prisoner
was
silent
from
that
time
he
became
more
sullen
than
ever
only
at
times
he
was
observed
when
alone
to
fling
himself
on
the
ground
and
cry
like
a
child
it
was
generally
thought
that
his
brain
was
affected
when
vickers
came
dawes
sought
an
interview
and
begged
to
be
sent
back
to
hobart
town
this
was
refused
of
course
but
he
was
put
to
work
on
the
osprey
after
working
there
for
some
time
and
being
released
from
his
irons
he
concealed
himself
on
the
slip
and
in
the
evening
swam
across
the
harbour
he
was
pursued
retaken
and
flogged
then
he
ran
the
dismal
round
of
punishment
he
burnt
lime
dragged
timber
and
tugged
at
the
oar
the
heaviest
and
most
degrading
tasks
were
always
his
shunned
and
hated
by
his
companions
feared
by
the
convict
overseers
and
regarded
with
unfriendly
eyes
by
the
authorities
rufus
dawes
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
that
abyss
of
woe
into
which
he
had
voluntarily
cast
himself
goaded
to
desperation
by
his
own
thoughts
he
had
joined
with
gabbett
and
the
unlucky
three
in
their
desperate
attempt
to
escape
but
as
vickers
stated
he
had
been
captured
almost
instantly
he
was
lamed
by
the
heavy
irons
he
wore
and
though
gabbett
with
a
strange
eagerness
for
which
after
events
accounted
insisted
that
he
could
make
good
his
flight
the
unhappy
man
fell
in
the
first
hundred
yards
of
the
terrible
race
and
was
seized
by
two
volunteers
before
he
could
rise
again
his
capture
helped
to
secure
the
brief
freedom
of
his
comrades
for
troke
content
with
one
prisoner
checked
a
pursuit
which
the
nature
of
the
ground
rendered
dangerous
and
triumphantly
brought
dawes
back
to
the
settlement
as
his
for
the
negligence
which
had
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
other
four
for
this
madness
the
refractory
convict
had
been
condemned
to
the
solitude
of
the
grummet
rock
in
that
dismal
hermitage
his
mind
preying
on
itself
had
become
disordered
he
saw
visions
and
dreamt
dreams
he
would
lie
for
hours
motionless
staring
at
the
sun
or
the
sea
he
held
converse
with
imaginary
beings
he
enacted
the
scene
with
his
mother
over
again
he
harangued
the
rocks
and
called
upon
the
stones
about
him
to
witness
his
innocence
and
his
sacrifice
he
was
visited
by
the
phantoms
of
his
early
friends
and
sometimes
thought
his
present
life
a
dream
whenever
he
awoke
however
he
was
commanded
by
a
voice
within
himself
to
leap
into
the
surges
which
washed
the
walls
of
his
prison
and
to
dream
these
sad
dreams
no
more
in
the
midst
of
this
lethargy
of
body
and
brain
the
unusual
occurrences
along
the
shore
of
the
settlement
roused
in
him
a
still
fiercer
hatred
of
life
he
saw
in
them
something
incomprehensible
and
terrible
and
read
in
them
threats
of
an
increase
of
misery
had
he
known
that
the
ladybird
was
preparing
for
sea
and
that
it
had
been
already
decided
to
fetch
him
from
the
rock
and
iron
him
with
the
rest
for
safe
passage
to
hobart
town
he
might
have
paused
but
he
knew
nothing
save
that
the
burden
of
life
was
insupportable
and
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
be
rid
of
it
in
the
meantime
the
settlement
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
in
less
than
three
weeks
from
the
announcement
made
by
vickers
all
had
been
got
ready
the
commandant
had
finally
arranged
with
frere
as
to
his
course
of
action
he
would
himself
accompany
the
ladybird
with
the
main
body
his
wife
and
daughter
were
to
remain
until
the
sailing
of
the
osprey
which
frere
charged
with
the
task
of
final
destruction
was
to
bring
up
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
leave
you
a
corporal
guard
and
ten
prisoners
as
a
crew
vickers
said
you
can
work
her
easily
with
that
to
which
frere
smiling
at
vickers
in
a
way
had
replied
that
he
could
do
with
five
prisoners
if
necessary
for
he
knew
how
to
get
double
work
out
of
the
lazy
dogs
among
the
incidents
which
took
place
during
the
breaking
up
was
one
which
it
is
necessary
to
chronicle
near
philip
island
on
the
north
side
of
the
harbour
is
situated
coal
head
where
a
party
had
been
lately
at
work
this
party
hastily
withdrawn
by
vickers
to
assist
in
the
business
of
devastation
had
left
behind
it
some
tools
and
timber
and
at
the
eleventh
hour
a
boat
crew
was
sent
to
bring
away
the
débris
the
tools
were
duly
collected
and
the
pine
logs
worth
shillings
apiece
in
hobart
town
duly
rafted
and
chained
the
timber
was
secured
and
the
convicts
towing
it
after
them
pulled
for
the
ship
just
as
the
sun
sank
in
the
general
relaxation
of
discipline
and
haste
the
raft
had
not
been
made
with
as
much
care
as
usual
and
the
strong
current
against
which
the
boat
was
labouring
assisted
the
negligence
of
the
convicts
the
logs
began
to
loosen
and
although
the
onward
motion
of
the
boat
kept
the
chain
taut
when
the
rowers
slackened
their
exertions
the
mass
parted
and
troke
hooking
himself
on
to
the
side
of
the
ladybird
saw
a
huge
log
slip
out
from
its
fellows
and
disappear
into
the
darkness
gazing
after
it
with
an
indignant
and
disgusted
stare
as
though
it
had
been
a
refractory
prisoner
who
merited
two
days
solitary
he
thought
he
heard
a
cry
from
the
direction
in
which
it
had
been
borne
he
would
have
paused
to
listen
but
all
his
attention
was
needed
to
save
the
timber
and
to
prevent
the
boat
from
being
swamped
by
the
struggling
mass
at
her
stern
the
cry
had
proceeded
from
rufus
dawes
from
his
solitary
rock
he
had
watched
the
boat
pass
him
and
make
for
the
ladybird
in
the
channel
and
he
had
decided
with
that
curious
childishness
into
which
the
mind
relapses
on
such
supreme
occasions
that
the
moment
when
the
gathering
gloom
swallowed
her
up
should
be
the
moment
when
he
would
plunge
into
the
surge
below
him
the
boat
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
as
each
tug
of
the
oars
took
her
farther
from
him
presently
only
the
figure
of
troke
in
the
stern
sheets
was
visible
then
that
also
disappeared
and
as
the
nose
of
the
timber
raft
rose
on
the
swell
of
the
next
wave
rufus
dawes
flung
himself
into
the
sea
he
was
heavily
ironed
and
he
sank
like
a
stone
he
had
resolved
not
to
attempt
to
swim
and
for
the
first
moment
kept
his
arms
raised
above
his
head
in
order
to
sink
the
quicker
but
as
the
short
sharp
agony
of
suffocation
caught
him
and
the
shock
of
the
icy
water
dispelled
the
mental
intoxication
under
which
he
was
labouring
he
desperately
struck
out
and
despite
the
weight
of
his
irons
gained
the
surface
for
an
instant
as
he
did
so
all
bewildered
and
with
the
one
savage
instinct
of
predominant
over
all
other
thoughts
he
became
conscious
of
a
huge
black
mass
surging
upon
him
out
of
the
darkness
an
instant
buffet
with
the
current
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
dive
beneath
it
a
horrible
sense
that
the
weight
at
his
feet
was
dragging
him
down
and
the
huge
log
loosened
from
the
raft
was
upon
him
crushing
him
beneath
its
rough
and
ragged
sides
all
thoughts
of
vanished
with
the
presence
of
actual
peril
and
uttering
that
despairing
cry
which
had
been
faintly
heard
by
troke
he
flung
up
his
arms
to
clutch
the
monster
that
was
pushing
him
down
to
death
the
log
passed
completely
over
him
thrusting
him
beneath
the
water
but
his
hand
scraping
along
the
splintered
side
came
in
contact
with
the
loop
of
hide
rope
that
yet
hung
round
the
mass
and
clutched
it
with
the
tenacity
of
a
death
grip
in
another
instant
he
got
his
head
above
water
and
making
good
his
hold
twisted
himself
by
a
violent
effort
across
the
log
for
a
moment
he
saw
the
lights
from
the
stern
windows
of
the
anchored
vessels
low
in
the
distance
grummet
rock
disappeared
on
his
left
then
exhausted
breathless
and
bruised
he
closed
his
eyes
and
the
drifting
log
bore
him
swiftly
and
silently
away
into
the
darkness
at
daylight
the
next
morning
troke
landing
on
the
prison
rock
found
it
deserted
the
prisoner
cap
was
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
little
cliff
but
the
prisoner
himself
had
disappeared
pulling
back
to
the
ladybird
the
intelligent
troke
pondered
on
the
circumstance
and
in
delivering
his
report
to
vickers
mentioned
the
strange
cry
he
had
heard
the
night
before
it
my
belief
sir
that
he
was
trying
to
swim
the
bay
he
said
he
must
ha
gone
to
the
bottom
anyhow
for
he
swim
five
yards
with
them
vickers
busily
engaged
in
getting
under
weigh
accepted
this
very
natural
supposition
without
question
the
prisoner
had
met
his
death
either
by
his
own
act
or
by
accident
it
was
either
a
suicide
or
an
attempt
to
escape
and
the
former
conduct
of
rufus
dawes
rendered
the
latter
explanation
a
more
probable
one
in
any
case
he
was
dead
as
troke
rightly
surmised
no
man
could
swim
the
bay
in
irons
and
when
the
ladybird
an
hour
later
passed
the
grummet
rock
all
on
board
her
believed
that
the
corpse
of
its
late
occupant
was
lying
beneath
the
waves
that
seethed
at
its
base
chapter
vii
the
last
of
macquarie
harbour
rufus
dawes
was
believed
to
be
dead
by
the
party
on
board
the
ladybird
and
his
strange
escape
was
unknown
to
those
still
at
sarah
island
maurice
frere
if
he
bestowed
a
thought
upon
the
refractory
prisoner
of
the
rock
believed
him
to
be
safely
stowed
in
the
hold
of
the
schooner
and
already
to
hobart
town
while
not
one
of
the
eighteen
persons
on
board
the
osprey
suspected
that
the
boat
which
had
put
off
for
the
marooned
man
had
returned
without
him
indeed
the
party
had
little
leisure
for
thought
frere
eager
to
prove
his
ability
and
energy
was
making
strenuous
exertions
to
get
away
and
kept
his
unlucky
ten
so
hard
at
work
that
within
a
week
from
the
departure
of
the
ladybird
the
osprey
was
ready
for
sea
vickers
and
the
child
having
watched
with
some
excusable
regret
the
process
of
demolishing
their
old
home
had
settled
down
in
their
small
cabin
in
the
brig
and
on
the
evening
of
the
of
january
bates
the
pilot
who
acted
as
master
informed
the
crew
that
lieutenant
frere
had
given
orders
to
weigh
anchor
at
daybreak
at
daybreak
accordingly
the
brig
set
sail
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
and
by
three
in
the
afternoon
anchored
safely
outside
the
gates
unfortunately
the
wind
shifted
to
the
which
caused
a
heavy
swell
on
the
bar
and
prudent
bates
having
consideration
for
vickers
and
the
child
ran
back
ten
miles
into
wellington
bay
and
anchored
there
again
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
tide
was
running
strongly
and
the
brig
rolled
a
good
deal
vickers
kept
to
her
cabin
and
sent
sylvia
to
entertain
lieutenant
frere
sylvia
went
but
was
not
entertaining
she
had
conceived
for
frere
one
of
those
violent
antipathies
which
children
sometimes
own
without
reason
and
since
the
memorable
night
of
the
apology
had
been
barely
civil
to
him
in
vain
did
he
pet
her
and
compliment
her
she
was
not
to
be
flattered
into
liking
him
i
do
not
like
you
sir
she
said
in
her
stilted
fashion
but
that
need
make
no
difference
to
you
you
occupy
yourself
with
your
prisoners
i
can
amuse
myself
without
you
thank
oh
all
right
said
frere
i
do
want
to
interfere
but
he
felt
a
little
nettled
nevertheless
on
this
particular
evening
the
young
lady
relaxed
her
severity
of
demeanour
her
father
away
and
her
mother
sick
the
little
maiden
felt
lonely
and
as
a
last
resource
accepted
her
mother
commands
and
went
to
frere
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
deck
smoking
mr
frere
i
am
sent
to
talk
to
are
you
all
right
go
oh
dear
no
it
is
the
gentleman
place
to
entertain
be
amusing
come
and
sit
down
then
said
frere
who
was
in
good
humour
at
the
success
of
his
arrangements
what
shall
we
talk
about
you
stupid
man
as
if
i
knew
it
is
your
place
to
talk
tell
me
a
fairy
and
the
beanstalk
suggested
frere
jack
and
the
grandmother
nonsense
make
one
up
out
of
your
head
you
frere
laughed
i
ca
he
said
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
then
why
not
begin
i
shall
go
away
if
you
do
frere
rubbed
his
brows
well
have
you
read
have
you
read
crusoe
as
if
the
idea
was
a
brilliant
one
of
course
i
have
returned
sylvia
pouting
read
it
yes
everybody
read
crusoe
oh
have
they
well
i
did
know
let
me
see
and
pulling
hard
at
his
pipe
he
plunged
into
literary
reflection
sylvia
sitting
beside
him
eagerly
watching
for
the
happy
thought
that
never
came
pouted
and
said
what
a
stupid
stupid
man
you
are
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
get
back
to
papa
again
he
knows
all
sorts
of
stories
nearly
as
many
as
old
danny
knows
some
then
danny
with
as
much
surprise
as
if
she
said
walter
scott
of
course
he
does
i
suppose

her
head
on
one
side
with
an
amusing
expression
of
superiority

the
story
of
the
no

never
nor
the
horse
of
the
peppers

i
suppose

nor
the
sylvia
got
off
the
skylight
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
and
surveyed
the
smoking
animal
beside
her
with
profound
contempt
mr
frere
you
are
really
a
most
ignorant
person
excuse
me
if
i
hurt
your
feelings
i
have
no
wish
to
do
that
but
really
you
are
a
most
ignorant
person
for
your
age
of
maurice
frere
grew
a
little
angry

are
very
impertinent
sylvia
said
he

and
i

and

threat
she
carried

spot

filled
the
dangerous
office
of
pilot
told
her
about
divers
and
coral
reefs
and
some
adventures
of
his
a
little
apocryphal
in
the
china
seas
frere
resumed
his
smoking
half
angry
with
himself
and
half
angry
with
the
provoking
little
fairy
this
elfin
creature
had
a
fascination
for
him
which
he
could
not
account
for
however
he
saw
no
more
of
her
that
evening
and
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
she
received
him
with
quaint
haughtiness
when

eating
complacently
what
would
you
do
why
i
make
you
stand
at
the
door
of
paul
cathedral
in
a
white
sheet
with
a
lighted
candle
in
your
hand
until
you
gave
up
your
wicked
aggravating
ways
you
man
the
picture
of
frere
in
a
white
sheet
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
at
the
door
of
paul
cathedral
was
too
much
for
gravity
and
he
roared
with
laughter
she
a
queer
child
ai
she
sir
a
born
natural
and
a
little
when
shall
we
be
able
to
get
away
bates
asked
frere
whose
dignity
was
wounded
by
the
mirth
of
the
pilot
bates
felt
the
change
of
tone
and
hastened
to
accommodate
himself
to
his
officer
humour
i
hopes
by
evening
sir
said
he
if
the
tide
slackens
then
i
risk
it
but
it
no
use
trying
it
the
men
were
wanting
to
go
ashore
to
wash
their
clothes
said
frere
if
we
are
to
stop
here
till
evening
you
had
better
let
them
go
after
all
right
sir
said
bates
the
afternoon
passed
off
auspiciously
the
ten
prisoners
went
ashore
and
washed
their
clothes
their
names
were
james
barker
james
lesly
john
lyon
benjamin
riley
william
cheshire
henry
shiers
william
russen
james
porter
john
fair
and
john
rex
this
last
scoundrel
had
come
on
board
latest
of
all
he
had
behaved
himself
a
little
better
recently
and
during
the
work
attendant
upon
the
departure
of
the
ladybird
had
been
conspicuously
useful
his
intelligence
and
influence
among
his
combined
to
make
him
a
somewhat
important
personage
and
vickers
had
allowed
him
privileges
from
which
he
had
been
hitherto
debarred
frere
however
who
superintended
the
shipment
of
some
stores
seemed
to
be
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
rex
evident
willingness
to
work
he
never
ceased
to
hurry
and
find
fault
with
him
he
vowed
that
he
was
lazy
sulky
or
impertinent
it
was
rex
come
here
do
this
do
that
as
the
prisoners
declared
among
themselves
it
was
evident
that
frere
had
a
down
on
the
dandy
the
day
before
the
ladybird
sailed
rex
rejoicing
in
the
hope
of
speedy
departure
had
suffered
himself
to
reply
to
some
more
than
usually
galling
remark
and
frere
had
complained
to
vickers
the
fellow
too
ready
to
get
away
said
he
let
him
stop
for
the
osprey
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
vickers
assented
and
john
rex
was
informed
that
he
was
not
to
sail
with
the
first
party
his
comrades
vowed
that
this
order
was
an
act
of
tyranny
but
he
himself
said
nothing
he
only
redoubled
his
activity
and
despite
all
his
wish
to
the
contrary
frere
was
unable
to
find
fault
he
even
took
credit
to
himself
for
taming
the
convict
spirit
and
pointed
out
rex
silent
and
obedient
as
a
proof
of
the
excellence
of
severe
measures
to
the
convicts
however
who
knew
john
rex
better
this
silent
activity
was
ominous
he
returned
with
the
rest
however
on
the
evening
of
the
in
apparently
cheerful
mood
indeed
frere
who
wearied
by
the
delay
had
decided
to
take
the
in
which
the
prisoners
had
returned
and
catch
a
few
fish
before
dinner
observed
him
laughing
with
some
of
the
others
and
again
congratulated
himself
the
time
wore
on
darkness
was
closing
in
and
bates
walking
the
deck
kept
a
for
the
boat
with
the
intention
of
weighing
anchor
and
making
for
the
bar
all
was
secure
vickers
and
the
child
were
safely
below
the
two
remaining
soldiers
two
had
gone
with
frere
were
upon
deck
and
the
prisoners
in
the
forecastle
were
singing
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
sea
had
gone
down
in
less
than
an
hour
the
osprey
would
be
safely
outside
the
harbour
chapter
viii
the
power
of
the
wilderness
the
drifting
log
that
had
so
strangely
served
as
a
means
of
saving
rufus
dawes
swam
with
the
current
that
was
running
out
of
the
bay
for
some
time
the
burden
that
it
bore
was
an
insensible
one
exhausted
with
his
desperate
struggle
for
life
the
convict
lay
along
the
rough
back
of
this
raft
without
motion
almost
without
breath
at
length
a
violent
shock
awoke
him
to
consciousness
and
he
perceived
that
the
log
had
become
stranded
on
a
sandy
point
the
extremity
of
which
was
lost
in
darkness
painfully
raising
himself
from
his
uncomfortable
posture
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
crawling
a
few
paces
up
the
beach
flung
himself
upon
the
ground
and
slept
when
morning
dawned
he
recognized
his
position
the
log
had
in
passing
under
the
lee
of
philip
island
been
cast
upon
the
southern
point
of
coal
head
some
three
hundred
yards
from
him
were
the
mutilated
sheds
of
the
coal
gang
for
some
time
he
lay
still
basking
in
the
warm
rays
of
the
rising
sun
and
scarcely
caring
to
move
his
bruised
and
shattered
limbs
the
sensation
of
rest
was
so
exquisite
that
it
overpowered
all
other
considerations
and
he
did
not
even
trouble
himself
to
conjecture
the
reason
for
the
apparent
desertion
of
the
huts
close
by
him
if
there
was
no
one
there
well
and
good
if
the
coal
party
had
not
gone
he
would
be
discovered
in
a
few
moments
and
brought
back
to
his
island
prison
in
his
exhaustion
and
misery
he
accepted
the
alternative
and
slept
again
as
he
laid
down
his
aching
head
troke
was
reporting
his
death
to
vickers
and
while
he
still
slept
the
ladybird
on
her
way
out
passed
him
so
closely
that
any
one
on
board
her
might
with
a
good
glass
have
espied
his
slumbering
figure
as
it
lay
upon
the
sand
when
he
woke
it
was
past
midday
and
the
sun
poured
its
full
rays
upon
him
his
clothes
were
dry
in
all
places
save
the
side
on
which
he
had
been
lying
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
refreshed
by
his
long
sleep
he
scarcely
comprehended
as
yet
his
true
position
he
had
escaped
it
was
true
but
not
for
long
he
was
versed
in
the
history
of
escapes
and
knew
that
a
man
alone
on
that
barren
coast
was
face
to
face
with
starvation
or
recapture
glancing
up
at
the
sun
he
wondered
indeed
how
it
was
that
he
had
been
free
so
long
then
the
coal
sheds
caught
his
eye
and
he
understood
that
they
were
untenanted
this
astonished
him
and
he
began
to
tremble
with
vague
apprehension
entering
he
looked
around
expecting
every
moment
to
see
some
lurking
constable
or
armed
soldier
suddenly
his
glance
fell
upon
the
food
rations
which
lay
in
the
corner
where
the
departing
convicts
had
flung
them
the
night
before
at
such
a
moment
this
discovery
seemed
like
a
direct
revelation
from
heaven
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
had
they
disappeared
had
he
lived
in
another
age
he
would
have
looked
round
for
the
angel
who
had
brought
them
by
and
by
having
eaten
of
this
miraculous
provender
the
poor
creature
began
reckoning
by
his
convict
experience
to
understand
what
had
taken
place
the
coal
workings
were
abandoned
the
new
commandant
had
probably
other
work
for
his
beasts
of
burden
to
execute
and
an
absconder
would
be
safe
here
for
a
few
hours
at
least
but
he
must
not
stay
for
him
there
was
no
rest
if
he
thought
to
escape
it
behoved
him
to
commence
his
journey
at
once
as
he
contemplated
the
meat
and
bread
something
like
a
ray
of
hope
entered
his
gloomy
soul
here
was
provision
for
his
needs
the
food
before
him
represented
the
rations
of
six
men
was
it
not
possible
to
cross
the
desert
that
lay
between
him
and
freedom
on
such
fare
the
very
supposition
made
his
heart
beat
faster
it
surely
was
possible
he
must
husband
his
resources
walk
much
and
eat
little
spread
out
the
food
for
one
day
into
the
food
for
three
here
was
six
men
food
for
one
day
or
one
man
food
for
six
days
he
would
live
on
a
third
of
this
and
he
would
have
rations
for
eighteen
days
eighteen
days
what
could
he
not
do
in
eighteen
days
he
could
walk
thirty
miles
a
day
forty
miles
a
day
that
would
be
six
hundred
miles
and
more
yet
stay
he
must
not
be
too
sanguine
the
road
was
difficult
the
scrub
was
in
places
impenetrable
he
would
have
to
make
détours
and
turn
upon
his
tracks
to
waste
precious
time
he
would
be
moderate
and
say
twenty
miles
a
day
twenty
miles
a
day
was
very
easy
walking
taking
a
piece
of
stick
from
the
ground
he
made
the
calculation
in
the
sand
eighteen
days
and
twenty
miles
a
day
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
more
than
enough
to
take
him
to
freedom
it
could
be
done
with
prudence
it
could
be
done
he
must
be
careful
and
abstemious
abstemious
he
had
already
eaten
too
much
and
he
hastily
pulled
a
piece
of
meat
from
his
mouth
and
replaced
it
with
the
rest
the
action
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
seemed
disgusting
was
in
the
case
of
this
poor
creature
merely
pitiable
having
come
to
this
resolution
the
next
thing
was
to
disencumber
himself
of
his
irons
this
was
more
easily
done
than
he
expected
he
found
in
the
shed
an
iron
gad
and
with
that
and
a
stone
he
drove
out
the
rivets
the
rings
were
too
strong
to
be
ovalled
or
he
would
have
been
free
long
ago
he
packed
the
meat
and
bread
together
and
then
pushing
the
gad
into
his
belt
it
might
be
needed
as
a
weapon
of
defence
he
set
out
on
his
journey
ovalled
to
oval
is
a
term
in
use
among
convicts
and
means
so
to
bend
the
round
ring
of
the
ankle
fetter
that
the
heel
can
be
drawn
up
through
it
his
intention
was
to
get
round
the
settlement
to
the
coast
reach
the
settled
districts
and
by
some
tale
of
shipwreck
or
of
wandering
procure
assistance
as
to
what
was
particularly
to
be
done
when
he
found
himself
among
free
men
he
did
not
pause
to
consider
at
that
point
his
difficulties
seemed
to
him
to
end
let
him
but
traverse
the
desert
that
was
before
him
and
he
would
trust
to
his
own
ingenuity
or
the
chance
of
fortune
to
avert
suspicion
the
peril
of
immediate
detection
was
so
imminent
that
beside
it
all
other
fears
were
dwarfed
into
insignificance
before
dawn
next
morning
he
had
travelled
ten
miles
and
by
husbanding
his
food
he
succeeded
by
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
in
accomplishing
forty
more
footsore
and
weary
he
lay
in
a
thicket
of
the
thorny
melaleuca
and
felt
at
last
that
he
was
beyond
pursuit
the
next
day
he
advanced
more
slowly
the
bush
was
unpropitious
dense
scrub
and
savage
jungle
impeded
his
path
barren
and
stony
mountain
ranges
arose
before
him
he
was
lost
in
gullies
entangled
in
thickets
bewildered
in
morasses
the
sea
that
had
hitherto
gleamed
salt
glittering
and
hungry
upon
his
right
hand
now
shifted
to
his
left
he
had
mistaken
his
course
and
he
must
turn
again
for
two
days
did
this
bewilderment
last
and
on
the
third
he
came
to
a
mighty
cliff
that
pierced
with
its
blunt
pinnacle
the
clustering
bush
he
must
go
over
or
round
this
obstacle
and
he
decided
to
go
round
it
a
natural
pathway
wound
about
its
foot
here
and
there
branches
were
broken
and
it
seemed
to
the
poor
wretch
fainting
under
the
weight
of
his
lessening
burden
that
his
were
not
the
first
footsteps
which
had
trodden
there
the
path
terminated
in
a
glade
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
glade
was
something
that
fluttered
rufus
dawes
pressed
forward
and
stumbled
over
a
corpse
in
the
terrible
stillness
of
that
solitary
place
he
felt
suddenly
as
though
a
voice
had
called
to
him
all
the
hideous
fantastic
tales
of
murder
which
he
had
read
or
heard
seemed
to
take
visible
shape
in
the
person
of
the
loathly
carcase
before
him
clad
in
the
yellow
dress
of
a
convict
and
lying
flung
together
on
the
ground
as
though
struck
down
stooping
over
it
impelled
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
know
the
worst
he
found
the
body
was
mangled
one
arm
was
missing
and
the
skull
had
been
beaten
in
by
some
heavy
instrument
the
first
thought
that
this
heap
of
rags
and
bones
was
a
mute
witness
to
the
folly
of
his
own
undertaking
the
corpse
of
some
starved
absconder
gave
place
to
a
second
more
horrible
suspicion
he
recognized
the
number
imprinted
on
the
coarse
cloth
as
that
which
had
designated
the
younger
of
the
two
men
who
had
escaped
with
gabbett
he
was
standing
on
the
place
where
a
murder
had
been
committed
a
murder
and
what
else
thank
god
the
food
he
carried
was
not
yet
exhausted
he
turned
and
fled
looking
back
fearfully
as
he
went
he
could
not
breathe
in
the
shadow
of
that
awful
mountain
crashing
through
scrub
and
brake
torn
bleeding
and
wild
with
terror
he
reached
a
spur
on
the
range
and
looked
around
him
above
him
rose
the
iron
hills
below
him
lay
the
panorama
of
the
bush
the
white
cone
of
the
frenchman
cap
was
on
his
right
hand
on
his
left
a
succession
of
ranges
seemed
to
bar
further
progress
a
gleam
as
of
a
lake
streaked
the
eastward
gigantic
pine
trees
reared
their
graceful
heads
against
the
opal
of
the
evening
sky
and
at
their
feet
the
dense
scrub
through
which
he
had
so
painfully
toiled
spread
without
break
and
without
flaw
it
seemed
as
though
he
could
leap
from
where
he
stood
upon
a
solid
mass
of
he
raised
his
eyes
and
right
against
him
like
a
long
dull
sword
lay
the
narrow
reach
of
the
harbour
from
which
he
had
escaped
one
darker
speck
moved
on
the
dark
water
it
was
the
osprey
making
for
the
gates
it
seemed
that
he
could
throw
a
stone
upon
her
deck
a
faint
cry
of
rage
escaped
him
during
the
last
three
days
in
the
bush
he
must
have
retraced
his
steps
and
returned
upon
his
own
track
to
the
settlement
more
than
half
his
allotted
time
had
passed
and
he
was
not
yet
thirty
miles
from
his
prison
death
had
waited
to
overtake
him
in
this
barbarous
wilderness
as
a
cat
allows
a
mouse
to
escape
her
for
a
while
so
had
he
been
permitted
to
trifle
with
his
fate
and
lull
himself
into
a
false
security
escape
was
hopeless
now
he
never
could
escape
and
as
the
unhappy
man
raised
his
despairing
eyes
he
saw
that
the
sun
redly
sinking
behind
a
lofty
pine
which
topped
the
opposite
hill
shot
a
ray
of
crimson
light
into
the
glade
below
him
it
was
as
though
a
bloody
finger
pointed
at
the
corpse
which
lay
there
and
rufus
dawes
shuddering
at
the
dismal
omen
averting
his
face
plunged
again
into
the
forest
for
four
days
he
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
bush
he
had
given
up
all
hopes
of
making
the
overland
journey
and
yet
as
long
as
his
scanty
supply
of
food
held
out
he
strove
to
keep
away
from
the
settlement
unable
to
resist
the
pangs
of
hunger
he
had
increased
his
daily
ration
and
though
the
salted
meat
exposed
to
rain
and
heat
had
begun
to
turn
putrid
he
never
looked
at
it
but
he
was
seized
with
a
desire
to
eat
his
fill
the
coarse
lumps
of
carrion
and
the
hard
were
to
him
delicious
morsels
fit
for
the
table
of
an
emperor
once
or
twice
he
was
constrained
to
pluck
and
eat
the
tops
of
and
peppermint
shrubs
these
had
an
aromatic
taste
and
sufficed
to
stay
the
cravings
of
hunger
for
a
while
but
they
induced
a
raging
thirst
which
he
slaked
at
the
icy
mountain
springs
had
it
not
been
for
the
frequency
of
these
streams
he
must
have
died
in
a
few
days
at
last
on
the
twelfth
day
from
his
departure
from
the
coal
head
he
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
mount
direction
at
the
head
of
the
peninsula
which
makes
the
western
side
of
the
harbour
his
terrible
wandering
had
but
led
him
to
make
a
complete
circuit
of
the
settlement
and
the
next
night
brought
him
round
the
shores
of
birches
inlet
to
the
opposite
to
sarah
island
his
stock
of
provisions
had
been
exhausted
for
two
days
and
he
was
savage
with
hunger
he
no
longer
thought
of
suicide
his
dominant
idea
was
now
to
get
food
he
would
do
as
many
others
had
done
before
him
give
himself
up
to
be
flogged
and
fed
when
he
reached
the
however
the
was
empty
he
looked
across
at
the
island
prison
and
saw
no
sign
of
life
the
settlement
was
deserted
the
shock
of
this
discovery
almost
deprived
him
of
reason
for
days
that
had
seemed
centuries
he
had
kept
life
in
his
jaded
and
lacerated
body
solely
by
the
strength
of
his
fierce
determination
to
reach
the
settlement
and
now
that
he
had
reached
it
after
a
journey
of
unparalleled
horror
he
found
it
deserted
he
struck
himself
to
see
if
he
was
not
dreaming
he
refused
to
believe
his
eyesight
he
shouted
screamed
and
waved
his
tattered
garments
in
the
air
exhausted
by
these
paroxysms
he
said
to
himself
quite
calmly
that
the
sun
beating
on
his
unprotected
head
had
dazed
his
brain
and
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
should
see
boats
pulling
towards
him
then
when
no
boat
came
he
argued
that
he
was
mistaken
in
the
place
the
island
yonder
was
not
sarah
island
but
some
other
island
like
it
and
that
in
a
second
or
so
he
would
be
able
to
detect
the
difference
but
the
inexorable
mountains
so
hideously
familiar
for
six
weary
years
made
mute
reply
and
the
sea
crawling
at
his
feet
seemed
to
grin
at
him
with
a
hungry
mouth
yet
the
fact
of
the
desertion
seemed
so
inexplicable
that
he
could
not
realize
it
he
felt
as
might
have
felt
that
wanderer
in
the
enchanted
mountains
who
returning
in
the
morning
to
look
for
his
companions
found
them
turned
to
stone
at
last
the
dreadful
truth
forced
itself
upon
him
he
retired
a
few
paces
and
then
with
a
horrible
cry
of
furious
despair
stumbled
forward
towards
the
edge
of
the
little
reef
that
fringed
the
shore
just
as
he
was
about
to
fling
himself
for
the
second
time
into
the
dark
water
his
eyes
sweeping
in
a
last
long
look
around
the
bay
caught
sight
of
a
strange
appearance
on
the
left
horn
of
the
sea
beach
a
thin
blue
streak
uprising
from
behind
the
western
arm
of
the
little
inlet
hung
in
the
still
air
it
was
the
smoke
of
a
fire
the
dying
wretch
felt
inspired
with
new
hope
god
had
sent
him
a
direct
sign
from
heaven
the
tiny
column
of
bluish
vapour
seemed
to
him
as
glorious
as
the
pillar
of
fire
that
led
the
israelites
there
were
yet
human
beings
near
him
and
turning
his
face
from
the
hungry
sea
he
tottered
with
the
last
effort
of
his
failing
strength
towards
the
blessed
token
of
their
presence
chapter
ix
the
seizure
of
the
osprey
frere
fishing
expedition
had
been
unsuccessful
and
in
consequence
prolonged
the
obstinacy
of
his
character
appeared
in
the
most
trifling
circumstances
and
though
the
fast
deepening
shades
of
an
australian
evening
urged
him
to
return
yet
he
lingered
unwilling
to
come
back
at
last
a
peremptory
signal
warned
him
it
was
the
sound
of
a
musket
fired
on
board
the
brig
bates
was
getting
impatient
and
with
a
scowl
frere
drew
up
his
lines
and
ordered
the
two
soldiers
to
pull
for
the
vessel
the
osprey
yet
sat
motionless
on
the
water
and
her
bare
masts
gave
no
sign
of
making
sail
to
the
soldiers
pulling
with
their
backs
to
her
the
musket
shot
seemed
the
most
ordinary
occurrence
in
the
world
eager
to
quit
the
dismal
they
had
viewed
mr
frere
persistent
fishing
with
disgust
and
had
for
the
previous
half
hour
longed
to
hear
the
signal
of
recall
which
had
just
startled
them
suddenly
however
they
noticed
a
change
of
expression
in
the
sullen
face
of
their
commander
frere
sitting
in
the
stern
sheets
with
his
face
to
the
osprey
had
observed
a
peculiar
appearance
on
her
decks
the
bulwarks
were
every
now
and
then
topped
by
strange
figures
who
disappeared
as
suddenly
as
they
came
and
a
faint
murmur
of
voices
floated
across
the
intervening
sea
presently
the
report
of
another
musket
shot
echoed
among
the
hills
and
something
dark
fell
from
the
side
of
the
vessel
into
the
water
frere
with
an
imprecation
of
mingled
alarm
and
indignation
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
looked
towards
the
brig
the
soldiers
resting
on
their
oars
imitated
his
gesture
and
the
thus
thrown
out
of
trim
rocked
from
side
to
side
dangerously
a
moment
anxious
pause
and
then
another
musket
shot
followed
by
a
woman
shrill
scream
explained
all
the
prisoners
had
seized
the
brig
give
way
cried
frere
pale
with
rage
and
apprehension
and
the
soldiers
realizing
at
once
the
full
terror
of
their
position
forced
the
heavy
through
the
water
as
fast
as
the
one
miserable
pair
of
oars
could
take
her
bates
affected
by
the
insidious
influence
of
the
hour
and
lulled
into
a
sense
of
false
security
had
gone
below
to
tell
his
little
playmate
that
she
would
soon
be
on
her
way
to
the
hobart
town
of
which
she
had
heard
so
much
and
taking
advantage
of
his
absence
the
soldier
not
on
guard
went
to
the
forecastle
to
hear
the
prisoners
singing
he
found
the
ten
together
in
high
good
humour
listening
to
a
shanty
sung
by
three
of
their
number
the
voices
were
melodious
enough
and
the
words
of
the
ditty
chanted
by
many
stout
fellows
in
many
a
forecastle
before
and
since
of
that
character
which
pleases
the
soldier
nature
private
grimes
forgot
all
about
the
unprotected
state
of
the
deck
and
sat
down
to
listen
while
he
listened
absorbed
in
tender
recollections
james
lesly
william
cheshire
william
russen
john
fair
and
james
barker
slipped
to
the
hatchway
and
got
upon
the
deck
barker
reached
the
aft
hatchway
as
the
soldier
who
was
on
guard
turned
to
complete
his
walk
and
passing
his
arm
round
his
neck
pulled
him
down
before
he
could
utter
a
cry
in
the
confusion
of
the
moment
the
man
loosed
his
grip
of
the
musket
to
grapple
with
his
unseen
antagonist
and
fair
snatching
up
the
weapon
swore
to
blow
out
his
brains
if
he
raised
a
finger
seeing
the
sentry
thus
secured
cheshire
as
if
in
pursuance
of
a
preconcerted
plan
leapt
down
the
after
hatchway
and
passed
up
the
muskets
from
the
to
lesly
and
russen
there
were
three
muskets
in
addition
to
the
one
taken
from
the
sentry
and
barker
leaving
his
prisoner
in
charge
of
fair
seized
one
of
them
and
ran
to
the
companion
ladder
russen
left
unarmed
by
this
manoeuvre
appeared
to
know
his
own
duty
he
came
back
to
the
forecastle
and
passing
behind
the
listening
soldier
touched
the
singer
on
the
shoulder
this
was
the
appointed
signal
and
john
rex
suddenly
terminating
his
song
with
a
laugh
presented
his
fist
in
the
face
of
the
gaping
grimes
no
noise
he
cried
the
brig
ours
and
ere
grimes
could
reply
he
was
seized
by
lyon
and
riley
and
bound
securely
come
on
lads
says
rex
and
pass
the
prisoner
down
here
we
got
her
this
time
i
go
bail
in
obedience
to
this
order
the
now
gagged
sentry
was
flung
down
the
fore
hatchway
and
the
hatch
secured
stand
on
the
hatchway
porter
cries
rex
again
and
if
those
fellows
come
up
knock
down
with
a
handspoke
lesly
and
russen
forward
to
the
companion
ladder
lyon
keep
a
for
the
boat
and
if
she
comes
too
near
fire
as
he
spoke
the
report
of
the
first
musket
rang
out
barker
had
apparently
fired
up
the
companion
hatchway
when
bates
had
gone
below
he
found
sylvia
curled
upon
the
cushions
of
the
reading
well
missy
he
said
we
soon
be
on
our
way
to
sylvia
answered
by
asking
a
question
altogether
foreign
to
the
subject
mr
bates
said
she
pushing
the
hair
out
of
her
blue
eyes
what
a
coracle
a
which
asked
bates
a
coracle
said
she
spelling
it
slowly
i
want
to
the
bewildered
bates
shook
his
head
never
heard
of
one
missy
said
he
bending
over
the
book
what
does
it
say
ancient
britons
said
sylvia
reading
gravely
little
better
than
barbarians
they
painted
their
bodies
with
woad
blue
stuff
you
know
bates
seated
in
their
light
coracles
of
skin
stretched
upon
slender
wooden
frames
must
have
presented
a
wild
and
savage
appearance
hah
said
bates
when
this
remarkable
passage
was
read
to
him
that
very
mysterious
that
is
a
corricle
a
cory
a
bright
light
burst
upon
him
a
curricle
you
mean
missy
it
a
carriage
i
seen
in
hy
park
with
young
bloods
of
what
are
young
bloods
asked
sylvia
rushing
at
this
new
opening
oh
nobs
swell
coves
do
you
know
returned
poor
bates
thus
again
attacked
young
men
o
fortune
that
is
that
given
to
doing
it
i
see
said
sylvia
waving
her
little
hand
graciously
noblemen
and
princes
and
that
sort
of
people
quite
so
but
what
about
coracle
well
said
the
humbled
bates
i
think
it
a
carriage
missy
a
sort
of
pheayton
as
they
call
sylvia
hardly
satisfied
returned
to
the
book
it
was
a
little
volume
a
child
history
of
england
and
after
perusing
it
awhile
with
knitted
brows
she
burst
into
a
childish
laugh
why
my
dear
bates
she
cried
waving
the
history
above
her
head
in
triumph
what
a
pair
of
geese
we
are
a
carriage
oh
you
silly
man
it
a
boat
is
it
said
bates
in
admiration
of
the
intelligence
of
his
companion
who
ha
thought
that
now
why
could
they
call
it
a
boat
at
once
then
and
ha
done
with
it
and
he
was
about
to
laugh
also
when
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
in
the
open
doorway
the
figure
of
james
barker
with
a
musket
in
his
hand
hallo
what
this
what
do
you
do
here
sir
sorry
to
disturb
yer
says
the
convict
with
a
grin
but
you
must
come
along
o
me
bates
at
once
comprehending
that
some
terrible
misfortune
had
occurred
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
one
of
the
cushions
of
the
couch
was
under
his
right
hand
and
snatching
it
up
he
flung
it
across
the
little
cabin
full
in
the
face
of
the
escaped
prisoner
the
soft
mass
struck
the
man
with
force
sufficient
to
blind
him
for
an
instant
the
musket
exploded
harmlessly
in
the
air
and
ere
the
astonished
barker
could
recover
his
footing
bates
had
hurled
him
out
of
the
cabin
and
crying
mutiny
locked
the
cabin
door
on
the
inside
the
noise
brought
out
vickers
from
her
berth
and
the
poor
little
student
of
english
history
ran
into
her
arms
good
heavens
bates
what
is
it
bates
furious
with
rage
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
swear
it
a
mutiny
said
he
go
back
to
your
cabin
and
lock
the
door
those
bloody
villains
have
risen
on
us
julia
vickers
felt
her
heart
grow
sick
was
she
never
to
escape
out
of
this
dreadful
life
go
into
your
cabin
says
bates
again
and
do
move
a
finger
till
i
tell
ye
maybe
it
ai
so
bad
as
it
looks
i
got
my
pistols
with
me
thank
god
and
frere
hear
the
shot
anyway
mutiny
on
deck
there
he
cried
at
the
full
pitch
of
his
voice
and
his
brow
grew
damp
with
dismay
when
a
mocking
laugh
from
above
was
the
only
response
thrusting
the
woman
and
child
into
the
state
berth
the
bewildered
pilot
cocked
a
pistol
and
snatching
a
cutlass
from
the
arm
stand
fixed
to
the
butt
of
the
mast
which
penetrated
the
cabin
he
burst
open
the
door
with
his
foot
and
rushed
to
the
companion
ladder
barker
had
retreated
to
the
deck
and
for
an
instant
he
thought
the
way
was
clear
but
lesly
and
russen
thrust
him
back
with
the
muzzles
of
the
loaded
muskets
he
struck
at
russen
with
the
cutlass
missed
him
and
seeing
the
hopelessness
of
the
attack
was
fain
to
retreat
in
the
meanwhile
grimes
and
the
other
soldier
had
loosed
themselves
from
their
bonds
and
encouraged
by
the
firing
which
seemed
to
them
a
sign
that
all
was
not
yet
lost
made
shift
to
force
up
the
forehatch
porter
whose
courage
was
none
of
the
fiercest
and
who
had
been
for
years
given
over
to
that
terror
of
discipline
which
servitude
induces
made
but
a
feeble
attempt
at
resistance
and
forcing
the
handspike
from
him
the
sentry
jones
rushed
aft
to
help
the
pilot
as
jones
reached
the
waist
cheshire
a
man
shot
him
dead
grimes
fell
over
the
corpse
and
cheshire
clubbing
the
musket
had
he
another
barrel
he
would
have
fired
coolly
battered
his
head
as
he
lay
and
then
seizing
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
jones
in
his
arms
tossed
it
into
the
sea
porter
you
lubber
he
cried
exhausted
with
the
effort
to
lift
the
body
come
and
bear
a
hand
with
this
other
one
porter
advanced
aghast
but
just
then
another
occurrence
claimed
the
attention
and
poor
grimes
life
was
spared
for
that
time
rex
inwardly
raging
at
this
unexpected
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
pilot
flung
himself
on
the
skylight
and
tore
it
up
bodily
as
he
did
so
barker
who
had
reloaded
his
musket
fired
down
into
the
cabin
the
ball
passed
through
the
door
and
splintering
the
wood
buried
itself
close
to
the
golden
curls
of
poor
little
sylvia
it
was
this
escape
which
drew
from
the
agonized
mother
that
shriek
which
pealing
through
the
open
stern
window
had
roused
the
soldiers
in
the
boat
rex
who
by
the
virtue
of
his
dandyism
yet
possessed
some
abhorrence
of
useless
crime
imagined
that
the
cry
was
one
of
pain
and
that
barker
bullet
had
taken
deadly
effect
you
killed
the
child
you
villain
he
cried
what
the
odds
asked
barker
sulkily
she
must
die
any
way
sooner
or
rex
put
his
head
down
the
skylight
and
called
on
bates
to
surrender
but
bates
only
drew
his
other
pistol
would
you
commit
murder
he
asked
looking
round
with
desperation
in
his
glance
no
no
cried
some
of
the
men
willing
to
blink
the
death
of
poor
jones
it
no
use
making
things
worse
than
they
are
bid
him
come
up
and
we
do
him
no
come
up
bates
says
rex
and
i
give
you
my
word
you
be
will
you
set
the
major
lady
and
child
ashore
then
asked
bates
sturdily
facing
the
scowling
brows
above
him
without
injury
continued
the
other
bargaining
as
it
were
at
the
very
muzzles
of
the
muskets
ay
ay
it
all
right
returned
russen
it
our
liberty
we
want
that
bates
hoping
against
hope
for
the
return
of
the
boat
endeavoured
to
gain
time
shut
down
the
skylight
then
said
he
with
the
ghost
of
an
authority
in
his
voice
until
i
ask
the
this
however
john
rex
refused
to
do
you
can
ask
well
enough
where
you
are
he
said
but
there
was
no
need
for
bates
to
put
a
question
the
door
of
the
opened
and
vickers
appeared
trembling
with
sylvia
by
her
side
accept
bates
she
said
since
it
must
be
so
we
should
gain
nothing
by
refusing
we
are
at
their
mercy
god
help
us
amen
to
that
says
bates
under
his
breath
and
then
aloud
we
agree
put
your
pistols
on
the
table
and
come
up
then
says
rex
covering
the
table
with
his
musket
as
he
spoke
and
nobody
shall
hurt

pale
and
sick
with
terror

sustained
by
that
strange
courage
of
which
we
have
before
spoken
passed
rapidly
under
the
open
skylight
and
prepared
to
ascend
sylvia
her
romance
crushed
by
too
dreadful
reality
clung
to
her
mother
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
pressed
close
to
her
little
bosom
the
english
history
in
her
fear
she
had
forgotten
to
lay
it
down
get
a
shawl
or
something
says
bates
and
a
hat
for
vickers
looked
back
across
the
space
beneath
the
open
skylight
and
shuddering
shook
her
head
the
men
above
swore
impatiently
at
the
delay
and
the
three
hastened
on
deck
who
to
command
the
brig
now
asked
undaunted
bates
as
they
came
up
i
am
says
john
rex
and
with
these
brave
fellows
i
take
her
round
the
the
touch
of
bombast
was
not
out
of
place
it
jumped
so
far
with
the
humour
of
the
convicts
that
they
set
up
a
feeble
cheer
at
which
sylvia
frowned
frightened
as
she
was
the
child
was
as
much
astonished
at
hearing
convicts
cheer
as
a
fashionable
lady
would
be
to
hear
her
footman
quote
poetry
bates
however
practical
and
calm
took
quite
another
view
of
the
case
the
bold
project
so
boldly
avowed
seemed
to
him
a
sheer
absurdity
the
dandy
and
a
crew
of
nine
convicts
navigate
a
brig
round
the
world
preposterous
why
not
a
man
aboard
could
work
a
reckoning
his
nautical
fancy
pictured
the
osprey
helplessly
rolling
on
the
swell
of
the
southern
ocean
or
hopelessly
locked
in
the
ice
of
the
antarctic
seas
and
he
dimly
guessed
at
the
fate
of
the
deluded
ten
even
if
they
got
safe
to
port
the
chances
of
final
escape
were
all
against
them
for
what
account
could
they
give
of
themselves
overpowered
by
these
reflections
the
honest
fellow
made
one
last
effort
to
charm
his
captors
back
to
their
pristine
bondage
fools
he
cried
do
you
know
what
you
are
about
to
do
you
will
never
escape
give
up
the
brig
and
i
will
declare
before
my
god
upon
the
bible
that
i
will
say
nothing
but
give
all
good
lesly
and
another
burst
into
a
laugh
at
this
wild
proposition
but
rex
who
had
weighed
his
chances
well
beforehand
felt
the
force
of
the
pilot
speech
and
answered
seriously
it
no
use
talking
he
said
shaking
his
still
handsome
head
we
have
got
the
brig
and
we
mean
to
keep
her
i
can
navigate
her
though
i
am
no
seaman
so
you
need
talk
further
about
it
bates
liberty
we
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
us
asked
bates
leave
you
bates
face
blanched
what
here
yes
it
do
look
a
picturesque
spot
does
it
and
yet
i
lived
here
for
some
years
and
he
grinned
bates
was
silent
the
logic
of
that
grin
was
unanswerable
come
cried
the
dandy
shaking
off
his
momentary
melancholy
look
alive
there
lower
away
the
vickers
go
down
to
your
cabin
and
get
anything
you
want
i
am
compelled
to
put
you
ashore
but
i
have
no
wish
to
leave
you
without
bates
listened
in
a
sort
of
dismal
admiration
at
this
courtly
convict
he
could
not
have
spoken
like
that
had
life
depended
on
it
now
my
little
lady
continued
rex
run
down
with
your
mamma
and
do
be
sylvia
flashed
burning
red
at
this
indignity
frightened
if
there
had
been
anybody
else
here
but
women
you
never
would
have
taken
the
brig
frightened
let
me
pass
prisoner
the
whole
deck
burst
into
a
great
laugh
at
this
and
poor
vickers
paused
trembling
for
the
consequences
of
the
child
temerity
to
thus
taunt
the
desperate
convict
who
held
their
lives
in
his
hands
seemed
sheer
madness
in
the
boldness
of
the
speech
however
lay
its
safeguard
rex
whose
politeness
was
mere
bravado
was
stung
to
the
quick
by
the
reflection
upon
his
courage
and
the
bitter
accent
with
which
the
child
had
pronounced
the
word
prisoner
the
generic
name
of
convicts
made
him
bite
his
lips
with
rage
had
he
had
his
will
he
would
have
struck
the
little
creature
to
the
deck
but
the
hoarse
laugh
of
his
companions
warned
him
to
forbear
there
is
public
opinion
even
among
convicts
and
rex
dared
not
vent
his
passion
on
so
helpless
an
object
as
men
do
in
such
cases
he
veiled
his
anger
beneath
an
affectation
of
amusement
in
order
to
show
that
he
was
not
moved
by
the
taunt
he
smiled
upon
the
taunter
more
graciously
than
ever
your
daughter
has
her
father
spirit
madam
said
he
to
vickers
with
a
bow
bates
opened
his
mouth
to
listen
his
ears
were
not
large
enough
to
take
in
the
words
of
this
complimentary
convict
he
began
to
think
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
nightmare
he
absolutely
felt
that
john
rex
was
a
greater
man
at
that
moment
than
john
bates
as
vickers
descended
the
hatchway
the
boat
with
frere
and
the
soldiers
came
within
musket
range
and
lesly
according
to
orders
fired
his
musket
over
their
heads
shouting
to
them
to
lay
to
but
frere
boiling
with
rage
at
the
manner
in
which
the
tables
had
been
turned
on
him
had
determined
not
to
resign
his
lost
authority
without
a
struggle
disregarding
the
summons
he
came
straight
on
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
vessel
it
was
now
nearly
dark
and
the
figures
on
the
deck
were
indistinguishable
the
indignant
lieutenant
could
but
guess
at
the
condition
of
affairs
suddenly
from
out
of
the
darkness
a
voice
hailed
him
hold
water
back
water
it
cried
and
was
then
seemingly
choked
in
its
owner
throat
the
voice
was
the
property
of
bates
standing
near
the
side
he
had
observed
rex
and
fair
bring
up
a
great
pig
of
iron
erst
used
as
part
of
the
ballast
of
the
brig
and
poise
it
on
the
rail
their
intention
was
but
too
evident
and
honest
bates
like
a
faithful
barked
to
warn
his
master
bloodthirsty
cheshire
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
frere
unheeding
ran
the
boat
alongside
under
the
very
nose
of
the
revengeful
rex
the
mass
of
iron
fell
half
upon
the
now
stayed
boat
and
gave
her
sternway
with
a
splintered
plank
villains
cried
frere
would
you
swamp
us
aye
laughed
rex
and
a
dozen
such
as
ye
the
brig
ours
ca
ye
see
and
we
your
masters
now
frere
stifling
an
exclamation
of
rage
cried
to
the
bow
to
hook
on
but
the
bow
had
driven
the
boat
backward
and
she
was
already
beyond
length
of
the
brig
looking
up
he
saw
cheshire
savage
face
and
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
as
he
cocked
his
piece
the
two
soldiers
exhausted
by
their
long
pull
made
no
effort
to
stay
the
progress
of
the
boat
and
almost
before
the
swell
caused
by
the
plunge
of
the
mass
of
iron
had
ceased
to
agitate
the
water
the
deck
of
the
osprey
had
become
invisible
in
the
darkness
frere
struck
his
fist
upon
the
thwart
in
sheer
impotence
of
rage
the
scoundrels
he
said
between
his
teeth
they
mastered
us
what
do
they
mean
to
do
next
the
answer
came
pat
to
the
question
from
the
dark
hull
of
the
brig
broke
a
flash
and
a
report
and
a
musket
ball
cut
the
water
beside
them
with
a
chirping
noise
between
the
black
indistinct
mass
which
represented
the
brig
and
the
glimmering
water
was
visible
a
white
speck
which
gradually
neared
them
come
alongside
with
ye
hailed
a
voice
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
ye
they
want
to
murder
us
says
frere
give
way
men
but
the
two
soldiers
exchanging
glances
one
with
the
other
pulled
the
boat
head
round
and
made
for
the
vessel
it
no
use
frere
said
the
man
nearest
him
we
can
do
no
good
now
and
they
wo
hurt
us
i
dare
you
dogs
you
are
in
league
with
them
bursts
out
frere
purple
with
indignation
do
you
mutiny
come
come
sir
returned
the
soldier
sulkily
this
ai
the
time
to
bully
and
as
for
mutiny
why
one
man
about
as
good
as
another
just
this
speech
from
the
lips
of
a
man
who
but
a
few
minutes
before
would
have
risked
his
life
to
obey
orders
of
his
officer
did
more
than
an
hour
reasoning
to
convince
maurice
frere
of
the
hopelessness
of
resistance
his
authority
born
of
circumstance
and
supported
by
adventitious
aid
had
left
him
the
musket
shot
had
reduced
him
to
the
ranks
he
was
now
no
more
than
anyone
else
indeed
he
was
less
than
many
for
those
who
held
the
firearms
were
the
ruling
powers
with
a
groan
he
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
and
looking
at
the
sleeve
of
the
undress
uniform
he
wore
it
seemed
to
him
that
virtue
had
gone
out
of
it
when
they
reached
the
brig
they
found
that
the
had
been
lowered
and
laid
alongside
in
her
were
eleven
persons
bates
with
forehead
gashed
and
hands
bound
the
stunned
grimes
russen
and
fair
pulling
lyon
riley
cheshire
and
lesly
with
muskets
and
john
rex
in
the
stern
sheets
with
bates
pistols
in
his
trousers
belt
and
a
loaded
musket
across
his
knees
the
white
object
which
had
been
seen
by
the
men
in
the
was
a
large
white
shawl
which
wrapped
vickers
and
sylvia
frere
muttered
an
oath
of
relief
when
he
saw
this
white
bundle
he
had
feared
that
the
child
was
injured
by
the
direction
of
rex
the
was
brought
alongside
the
and
cheshire
and
lesly
boarded
her
lesly
then
gave
his
musket
to
rex
and
bound
hands
behind
him
in
the
same
manner
as
had
been
done
for
bates
frere
attempted
to
resist
this
indignity
but
cheshire
clapping
his
musket
to
his
ear
swore
he
would
blow
out
his
brains
if
he
uttered
another
syllable
frere
catching
the
malignant
eye
of
john
rex
remembered
how
easily
a
twitch
of
the
finger
would
pay
off
old
scores
and
was
silent
step
in
here
sir
if
you
please
said
rex
with
polite
irony
i
am
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
tie
you
but
i
must
consult
my
own
safety
as
well
as
your
frere
scowled
and
stepping
awkwardly
into
the
fell
pinioned
as
he
was
he
could
not
rise
without
assistance
and
russen
pulled
him
roughly
to
his
feet
with
a
coarse
laugh
in
his
present
frame
of
mind
that
laugh
galled
him
worse
than
his
bonds
poor
vickers
with
a
woman
quick
instinct
saw
this
and
even
amid
her
own
trouble
found
leisure
to
console
him
the
wretches
she
said
under
her
breath
as
frere
was
flung
down
beside
her
to
subject
you
to
such
indignity
sylvia
said
nothing
and
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
lieutenant
perhaps
in
her
childish
fancy
she
had
pictured
him
as
coming
to
her
rescue
armed
and
clad
in
dazzling
mail
or
at
the
very
least
as
a
muscular
hero
who
would
settle
affairs
out
of
hand
by
sheer
personal
prowess
if
she
had
entertained
any
such
notion
the
reality
must
have
struck
coldly
upon
her
senses
frere
purple
clumsy
and
bound
was
not
at
all
heroic
now
my
lads
says
rex
who
seemed
to
have
endured
the
authority
of
frere
we
give
you
your
choice
stay
at
hell
gates
or
come
with
us
the
soldiers
paused
irresolute
to
join
the
mutineers
meant
a
certainty
of
hard
work
with
a
chance
of
ultimate
hanging
yet
to
stay
with
the
prisoners
was
as
far
as
they
could
see
to
incur
the
inevitable
fate
of
starvation
on
a
barren
coast
as
is
often
the
case
on
such
occasions
a
trifle
sufficed
to
turn
the
scale
the
wounded
grimes
who
was
slowly
recovering
from
his
stupor
dimly
caught
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
and
in
his
obfuscated
condition
of
intellect
must
needs
make
comment
upon
it
go
with
him
ye
beggars
said
he
and
leave
us
honest
men
oh
ye
get
a
for
the
phrase
brought
with
it
recollection
of
the
worst
portion
of
military
discipline
the
cat
and
revived
in
the
minds
of
the
pair
already
disposed
to
break
the
yoke
that
sat
so
heavily
upon
them
a
train
of
dismal
memories
the
life
of
a
soldier
on
a
convict
station
was
at
that
time
a
hard
one
he
was
often
stinted
in
rations
and
of
necessity
deprived
of
all
rational
recreation
while
punishment
for
offences
was
prompt
and
severe
the
companies
drafted
to
the
penal
settlements
were
not
composed
of
the
best
material
and
the
pair
had
good
precedent
for
the
course
they
were
about
to
take
come
says
rex
i
ca
wait
here
all
night
the
wind
is
freshening
and
we
must
make
the
bar
which
is
it
to
be
we
go
with
you
says
the
man
who
had
pulled
the
stroke
in
the
spitting
into
the
water
with
averted
face
upon
which
utterance
the
convicts
burst
into
joyous
oaths
and
the
pair
were
received
with
much
then
rex
with
lyon
and
riley
as
a
guard
got
into
the
whale
boat
and
having
loosed
the
two
prisoners
from
their
bonds
ordered
them
to
take

steering

and
the
two
recruits
pulling
and
the
other
four
standing
up
with
their
muskets
levelled
at
the
their
long
slavery
had
begotten
such
a
dread
of
authority
in
these
men
that
they
feared
it
even
when
it
was
bound
and
menaced
by
four
muskets
keep
your
distance
shouted
cheshire
as
frere
and
bates
in
obedience
to
orders
began
to
pull

towards
the
shore
and
in
this
fashion
was
the
dismal
little
party
conveyed
to
the
mainland
it
was
night
when
they
reached
it
but
the
clear
sky
began
to
thrill
with
a
late
moon
as
yet
unrisen
and
the
waves
breaking
gently
upon
the
beach
glimmered
with
a
radiance
born
of
their
own
motion
frere
and
bates
jumping
ashore
helped
out

sylvia
and
the
wounded

this
being
done
under
the
muzzles
of

commanded
that

push

as
far
as
they
could

shore

riley
catching

by

came

taken
in

now
boys
says
cheshire
with
a
savage
delight
three
cheers
for
old
england
and
liberty
upon
which
a
great
shout
went
up
echoed
by
the
grim
hills
which
had
witnessed
so
many
miseries
to
the
wretched
five
this
exultant
mirth
sounded
like
a
knell
of
death
great
god
cried
bates
running
up
to
his
knees
in
water
after
the
departing
boats

you
leave

the
jerk
and

chapter
xi
left
at
hell
there
is
no
need
to
dwell
upon
the
mental
agonies
of
that
miserable
night
perhaps
of
all
the
five
the
one
least
qualified
to
endure
it
realized
the
prospect
of
suffering
most
acutely
vickers
and
noodle
as
she
was
had
the
keen
instinct
of
approaching
danger
which
is
in
her
sex
a
sixth
sense
she
was
a
woman
and
a
mother
and
owned
a
double
capacity
for
suffering
her
feminine
imagination
pictured
all
the
horrors
of
death
by
famine
and
having
realized
her
own
torments
her
maternal
love
forced
her
to
live
them
over
again
in
the
person
of
her
child
rejecting
bates
offer
of
a
and
frere
vague
tenders
of
assistance
the
poor
woman
withdrew
behind
a
rock
that
faced
the
sea
and
with
her
daughter
in
her
arms
resigned
herself
to
her
torturing
thoughts
sylvia
recovered
from
her
terror
was
almost
content
and
curled
in
her
mother
shawl
slept
to
her
little
soul
this
midnight
mystery
of
boats
and
muskets
had
all
the
flavour
of
a
romance
with
bates
frere
and
her
mother
so
close
to
her
it
was
impossible
to
be
afraid
besides
it
was
obvious
that
papa
the
supreme
being
of
the
settlement
must
at
once
return
and
severely
punish
the
impertinent
prisoners
who
had
dared
to
insult
his
wife
and
child
and
as
sylvia
dropped
off
to
sleep
she
caught
herself
with
some
indignation
pitying
the
mutineers
for
the
tremendous
scrape
they
had
got
themselves
into
how
they
would
be
flogged
when
papa
came
back
in
the
meantime
this
sleeping
in
the
open
air
was
novel
and
rather
pleasant
honest
bates
produced
a
piece
of
biscuit
and
with
all
the
generosity
of
his
nature
suggested
that
this
should
be
set
aside
for
the
sole
use
of
the
two
females
but
vickers
would
not
hear
of
it
we
must
all
share
alike
said
she
with
something
of
the
spirit
that
she
knew
her
husband
would
have
displayed
under
like
circumstance
and
frere
wondered
at
her
apparent
strength
of
mind
had
he
been
gifted
with
more
acuteness
he
would
not
have
wondered
for
when
a
crisis
comes
to
one
of
two
persons
who
have
lived
much
together
the
influence
of
the
nobler
spirit
makes
itself
felt
frere
had
a
in
his
pocket
and
he
made
a
fire
with
some
dry
leaves
and
sticks
grimes
fell
asleep
and
the
two
men
sitting
at
their
fire
discussed
the
chances
of
escape
neither
liked
to
openly
broach
the
supposition
that
they
had
been
finally
deserted
it
was
concluded
between
them
that
unless
the
brig
sailed
in
the
night
and
the
now
risen
moon
showed
her
yet
lying
at
anchor
the
convicts
would
return
and
bring
them
food
this
supposition
proved
correct
for
about
an
hour
after
daylight
they
saw
the
pulling
towards
them
a
discussion
had
arisen
amongst
the
mutineers
as
to
the
propriety
of
at
once
making
sail
but
barker
who
had
been
one
of
the
crew
and
knew
the
dangers
of
the
bar
vowed
that
he
would
not
undertake
to
steer
the
brig
through
the
gates
until
morning
and
so
the
boats
being
secured
astern
a
strict
watch
was
set
lest
the
helpless
bates
should
attempt
to
rescue
the
vessel
during
the
evening
the
excitement
attendant
upon
the
outbreak
having
passed
away
and
the
magnitude
of
the
task
before
them
being
more
fully
apparent
to
their
minds
a
feeling
of
pity
for
the
unfortunate
party
on
the
mainland
took
possession
of
them
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
osprey
might
be
recaptured
in
which
case
five
useless
murders
would
have
been
committed
and
however
callous
in
bloodshed
were
the
majority
of
the
ten
not
one
among
them
could
contemplate
in
cold
blood
without
a
twinge
of
remorse
the
death
of
the
harmless
child
of
the
commandant
john
rex
seeing
how
matters
were
going
made
haste
to
take
to
himself
the
credit
of
mercy
he
ruled
and
had
always
ruled
his
ruffians
not
so
much
by
suggesting
to
them
the
course
they
should
take
as
by
leading
them
on
the
way
they
had
already
chosen
for
themselves
i
propose
said
he
that
we
divide
the
provisions
there
are
five
of
them
and
twelve
of
us
then
nobody
can
blame
ay
said
porter
mindful
of
a
similar
exploit
and
if
we
taken
they
can
tell
what
we
have
done
do
let
our
affair
be
like
that
of
the
cypress
to
leave
them
to
ay
ay
says
barker
right
when
fergusson
was
topped
at
hobart
town
i
heard
old
troke
say
that
if
he
not
refused
to
set
the
tucker
ashore
he
might
ha
got
off
with
a
whole
thus
urged
by
as
well
as
sentiment
to
mercy
the
provision
was
got
upon
deck
by
daylight
and
a
division
was
made
the
soldiers
with
generosity
born
of
remorse
were
for
giving
half
to
the
marooned
men
but
barker
exclaimed
against
this
when
the
schooner
finds
they
do
get
to
headquarters
she
bound
to
come
back
and
look
for
said
he
and
we
want
all
the
tucker
we
can
get
maybe
afore
we
sights
this
reasoning
was
admitted
and
acted
upon
there
was
in
the
about
fifty
pounds
of
salt
meat
and
a
third
of
this
quantity
together
with
half
a
small
sack
of
flour
some
tea
and
sugar
mixed
together
in
a
bag
and
an
iron
kettle
and
pannikin
was
placed
in
the
rex
fearful
of
excesses
among
his
crew
had
also
lowered
down
one
of
the
two
small
puncheons
of
rum
which
the
contained
cheshire
disputed
this
and
stumbling
over
a
goat
that
had
been
taken
on
board
from
philip
island
caught
the
creature
by
the
leg
and
threw
it
into
the
sea
bidding
rex
take
that
with
him
also
rex
dragged
the
poor
beast
into
the
boat
and
with
this
miscellaneous
cargo
pushed
off
to
the
shore
the
poor
goat
shivering
began
to
bleat
piteously
and
the
men
laughed
to
a
stranger
it
would
have
appeared
that
the
boat
contained
a
happy
party
of
fishermen
or
coast
settlers
returning
with
the
proceeds
of
a
day
marketing
laying
off
as
the
water
shallowed

called
to

for

to

and
all
were
carried
ashore
there
says
rex
you
ca
say
we
used
you
badly
for
we
divided
the
the
sight
of
this
almost
unexpected
succour
revived
the
courage
of
the
five
and
they
felt
grateful
after
the
horrible
anxiety
they
had
endured
all
that
night
they
were
prepared
to
look
with
kindly
eyes
upon
the
men
who
had
come
to
their
assistance
men
said
bates
with
something
like
a
sob
in
his
voice
i
expect
this
you
are
good
fellows
for
there
ai
much
tucker
aboard
i
yes
affirmed
frere
you
good
rex
burst
into
a
savage
laugh
shut
your
mouth
you
tyrant
said
he
forgetting
his
dandyism
in
the
recollection
of
his
former
suffering
it
ai
for
your
benefit
you
may
thank
the
lady
and
the
child
for
julia
vickers
hastened
to
propitiate
the
arbiter
of
her
fate
we
are
obliged
to
you
she
said
with
a
touch
of
quiet
dignity
resembling
her
husband
and
if
i
ever
get
back
safely
i
will
take
care
that
your
kindness
shall
be
the
swindler
and
forger
took
off
his
leather
cap
with
quite
an
air
it
was
five
years
since
a
lady
had
spoken
to
him
and
the
old
time
when
he
was
lionel
crofton
a
gentleman
sportsman
came
back
again
for
an
instant
at
that
moment
with
liberty
in
his
hand
and
fortune
all
before
him
he
felt
his
return
and
he
looked
the
lady
in
the
face
without
flinching
i
sincerely
trust
madam
said
he
that
you
will
get
back
safely
may
i
hope
for
your
good
wishes
for
myself
and
my
companions
listening
bates
burst
into
a
roar
of
astonished
enthusiasm
what
a
dog
it
is
he
cried
john
rex
john
rex
you
were
never
made
to
be
a
convict
man
rex
smiled
bates
and
god
preserve
you
says
bates
rubbing
his
hat
off
his
face
and
i
i
damme
i
hope
you
get
safe
off
there
for
liberty
sweet
to
every
prisoners
says
sylvia
waving
her
handkerchief
and
i
hope
they
wo
catch
you
so
with
cheers
and
waving
of
handkerchiefs
the
boat
departed
in
the
emotion
which
the
apparently
disinterested
conduct
of
john
rex
had
occasioned
the
exiles
all
earnest
thought
of
their
own
position
had
vanished
and
strange
to
say
the
prevailing
feeling
was
that
of
anxiety
for
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
mutineers
but
as
the
boat
grew
smaller
and
smaller
in
the
distance
so
did
their
consciousness
of
their
own
situation
grow
more
and
more
distinct
and
when
at
last
the
boat
had
disappeared
in
the
shadow
of
the
brig
all
started
as
if
from
a
dream
to
the
wakeful
contemplation
of
their
own
case
a
council
of
war
was
held
with
frere
at
the
head
of
it
and
the
possessions
of
the
little
party
were
thrown
into
common
stock
the
salt
meat
flour
and
tea
were
placed
in
a
hollow
rock
at
some
distance
from
the
beach
and
bates
was
appointed
purser
to
apportion
to
each
without
fear
or
favour
his
stated
allowance
the
goat
was
tethered
with
a
piece
of
fishing
line
sufficiently
long
to
allow
her
to
browse
the
cask
of
rum
by
special
agreement
was
placed
in
the
innermost
recess
of
the
rock
and
it
was
resolved
that
its
contents
should
not
be
touched
except
in
case
of
sickness
or
in
last
extremity
there
was
no
lack
of
water
for
a
spring
ran
bubbling
from
the
rocks
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
spot
where
the
party
had
landed
they
calculated
that
with
prudence
their
provisions
would
last
them
for
nearly
four
weeks
it
was
found
upon
a
review
of
their
possessions
that
they
had
among
them
three
pocket
knives
a
ball
of
string
two
pipes
matches
and
a
fig
of
tobacco
fishing
lines
with
hooks
and
a
big
which
frere
had
taken
to
gut
the
fish
he
had
expected
to
catch
but
they
saw
with
dismay
that
there
was
nothing
which
could
be
used
among
the
party
vickers
had
her
shawl
and
bates
a
but
frere
and
grimes
were
without
extra
clothing
it
was
agreed
that
each
should
retain
his
own
property
with
the
exception
of
the
fishing
lines
which
were
confiscated
to
the
commonwealth
having
made
these
arrangements
the
kettle
filled
with
water
from
the
spring
was
slung
from
three
green
sticks
over
the
fire
and
a
pannikin
of
weak
tea
together
with
a
biscuit
served
out
to
each
of
the
party
save
grimes
who
declared
himself
unable
to
eat
breakfast
over
bates
made
a
damper
which
was
cooked
in
the
ashes
and
then
another
council
was
held
as
to
future
habitation
it
was
clearly
evident
that
they
could
not
sleep
in
the
open
air
it
was
the
middle
of
summer
and
though
no
annoyance
from
rain
was
apprehended
the
heat
in
the
middle
of
the
day
was
most
oppressive
moreover
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
vickers
and
the
child
should
have
some
place
to
themselves
at
a
little
distance
from
the
beach
was
a
sandy
rise
that
led
up
to
the
face
of
the
cliff
and
on
the
eastern
side
of
this
rise
grew
a
forest
of
young
trees
frere
proposed
to
cut
down
these
trees
and
make
a
sort
of
hut
with
them
it
was
soon
discovered
however
that
the
pocket
knives
were
insufficient
for
this
purpose
but
by
dint
of
notching
the
young
saplings
and
then
breaking
them
down
they
succeeded
in
a
couple
of
hours
in
collecting
wood
enough
to
roof
over
a
space
between
the
hollow
rock
which
contained
the
provisions
and
another
rock
in
shape
like
a
hammer
which
jutted
out
within
five
yards
of
it
vickers
and
sylvia
were
to
have
this
hut
as
a
and
frere
and
bates
lying
at
the
mouth
of
the
larder
would
at
once
act
as
a
guard
to
it
and
them
grimes
was
to
make
for
himself
another
hut
where
the
fire
had
been
lighted
on
the
previous
night
when
they
got
back
to
dinner
inspirited
by
this
resolution
they
found
poor
vickers
in
great
alarm
grimes
who
by
reason
of
the
dint
in
his
skull
had
been
left
behind
was
walking
about
the
talking
mysteriously
and
shaking
his
fist
at
an
imaginary
foe
on
going
up
to
him
they
discovered
that
the
blow
had
affected
his
brain
for
he
was
delirious
frere
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
without
effect
and
at
last
by
bates
advice
the
poor
fellow
was
rolled
in
the
sea
the
cold
bath
quelled
his
violence
and
being
laid
beneath
the
shade
of
a
rock
hard
by
he
fell
into
a
condition
of
great
muscular
exhaustion
and
slept
the
damper
was
then
portioned
out
by
bates
and
together
with
a
small
piece
of
meat
it
formed
the
dinner
of
the
party
vickers
reported
that
she
had
observed
a
great
commotion
on
board
the
brig
and
thought
that
the
prisoners
must
be
throwing
overboard
such
portions
of
the
cargo
as
were
not
absolutely
necessary
to
them
in
order
to
lighten
her
this
notion
bates
declared
to
be
correct
and
further
pointed
out
that
the
mutineers
had
got
out
a
and
by
hauling
on
the
were
gradually
warping
the
brig
down
the
harbour
before
dinner
was
over
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
and
the
osprey
running
up
the
reversed
fired
a
musket
either
in
farewell
or
triumph
and
spreading
her
sails
disappeared
round
the
western
horn
of
the
harbour
vickers
taking
sylvia
with
her
went
away
a
few
paces
and
leaning
against
the
rugged
wall
of
her
future
home
wept
bitterly
bates
and
frere
affected
cheerfulness
but
each
felt
that
he
had
hitherto
regarded
the
presence
of
the
brig
as
a
sort
of
safeguard
and
had
never
fully
realized
his
own
loneliness
until
now
the
necessity
for
work
however
admitted
of
no
indulgence
of
vain
sorrow
and
bates
setting
the
example
the
pair
worked
so
hard
that
by
nightfall
they
had
torn
down
and
dragged
together
sufficient
brushwood
to
complete
vickers
hut
during
the
progress
of
this
work
they
were
often
interrupted
by
grimes
who
persisted
in
vague
rushes
at
them
exclaiming
loudly
against
their
supposed
treachery
in
leaving
him
at
the
mercy
of
the
mutineers
bates
also
complained
of
the
pain
caused
by
the
wound
in
his
forehead
and
that
he
was
afflicted
with
a
giddiness
which
he
knew
not
how
to
avert
by
dint
of
frequently
bathing
his
head
at
the
spring
however
he
succeeded
in
keeping
on
his
legs
until
the
work
of
dragging
together
the
boughs
was
completed
when
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
declared
that
he
could
rise
no
more
frere
applied
to
him
the
remedy
that
had
been
so
successfully
tried
upon
grimes
but
the
salt
water
inflamed
his
wound
and
rendered
his
condition
worse
vickers
recommended
that
a
little
spirit
and
water
should
be
used
to
wash
the
cut
and
the
cask
was
got
out
and
broached
for
that
purpose
tea
and
damper
formed
their
evening
meal
and
by
the
light
of
a
blazing
fire
their
condition
looked
less
desperate
vickers
had
set
the
pannikin
on
a
flat
stone
and
dispensed
the
tea
with
an
affectation
of
dignity
which
would
have
been
absurd
had
it
not
been
she
had
smoothed
her
hair
and
pinned
the
white
shawl
about
her
coquettishly
she
even
ventured
to
lament
to
frere
that
she
had
not
brought
more
clothes
sylvia
was
in
high
spirits
and
scorned
to
confess
hunger
when
the
tea
had
been
drunk
she
fetched
water
from
the
spring
in
the
kettle
and
bathed
bates
head
with
it
it
was
resolved
that
on
the
morrow
a
search
should
be
made
for
some
place
from
which
to
cast
the
fishing
line
and
that
one
of
the
number
should
fish
daily
the
condition
of
the
unfortunate
grimes
now
gave
cause
for
the
greatest
uneasiness
from
maundering
foolishly
he
had
taken
to
absolute
violence
and
had
to
be
watched
by
frere
after
much
muttering
and
groaning
the
poor
fellow
at
last
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
frere
having
assisted
bates
to
his
in
front
of
the
rock
and
laid
him
down
on
a
heap
of
green
brushwood
prepared
to
snatch
a
few
hours
slumber
wearied
by
excitement
and
the
labours
of
the
day
he
slept
heavily
but
towards
morning
was
awakened
by
a
strange
noise
grimes
whose
delirium
had
apparently
increased
had
succeeded
in
forcing
his
way
through
the
rude
fence
of
brushwood
and
had
thrown
himself
upon
bates
with
the
ferocity
of
insanity
growling
to
himself
he
had
seized
the
unfortunate
pilot
by
the
throat
and
the
pair
were
struggling
together
bates
weakened
by
the
sickness
that
had
followed
upon
his
wound
in
the
head
was
quite
unable
to
cope
with
his
desperate
assailant
but
calling
feebly
upon
frere
for
help
had
made
shift
to
lay
hold
upon
the
of
which
we
have
before
spoken
frere
starting
to
his
feet
rushed
to
the
assistance
of
the
pilot
but
was
too
late
grimes
enraged
by
the
sight
of
the
knife
tore
it
from
grasp
and
before
frere
could
catch
his
arm
plunged
it
twice
into
the
unfortunate
man
breast
i
a
dead
man
cried
bates
faintly
the
sight
of
the
blood
together
with
the
exclamation
of
his
victim
recalled
grimes
to
consciousness
he
looked
in
bewilderment
at
the
bloody
weapon
and
then
flinging
it
from
him
rushed
away
towards
the
sea
into
which
he
plunged
headlong
frere
aghast
at
this
sudden
and
terrible
tragedy
gazed
after
him
and
saw
from
out
the
placid
water
sparkling
in
the
bright
beams
of
morning
a
pair
of
arms
with
outstretched
hands
emerge
a
black
spot
that
was
a
head
uprose
between
these
stiffening
arms
and
then
with
a
horrible
cry
the
whole
disappeared
and
the
bright
water
sparkled
as
placidly
as
before
the
eyes
of
the
terrified
frere
travelling
back
to
the
wounded
man
saw
midway
between
this
sparkling
water
and
the
knife
that
lay
on
the
sand
an
object
that
went
far
to
explain
the
maniac
sudden
burst
of
fury
the
rum
cask
lay
upon
its
side
by
the
remnants
of
last
fire
and
close
to
it
was
a
clout
with
which
the
head
of
the
wounded
man
had
been
bound
it
was
evident
that
the
poor
creature
wandering
in
his
delirium
had
come
across
the
rum
cask
drunk
a
quantity
of
its
contents
and
been
maddened
by
the
fiery
spirit
frere
hurried
to
the
side
of
bates
and
lifting
him
up
strove
to
staunch
the
blood
that
flowed
from
his
chest
it
would
seem
that
he
had
been
resting
himself
on
his
left
elbow
and
that
grimes
snatching
the
knife
from
his
right
hand
had
stabbed
him
twice
in
the
right
breast
he
was
pale
and
senseless
and
frere
feared
that
the
wound
was
mortal
tearing
off
his
he
endeavoured
to
bandage
the
wound
but
found
that
the
strip
of
silk
was
insufficient
for
the
purpose
the
noise
had
roused
vickers
who
stifling
her
terror
made
haste
to
tear
off
a
portion
of
her
dress
and
with
this
a
bandage
of
sufficient
width
was
made
frere
went
to
the
cask
to
see
if
haply
he
could
obtain
from
it
a
little
spirit
with
which
to
moisten
the
lips
of
the
dying
man
but
it
was
empty
grimes
after
drinking
his
fill
had
overturned
the
unheaded
puncheon
and
the
greedy
sand
had
absorbed
every
drop
of
liquor
sylvia
brought
some
water
from
the
spring
and
vickers
bathing
bates
head
with
this
he
revived
a
little
vickers
milked
the
goat
she
had
never
done
such
a
thing
before
in
all
her
life
and
the
milk
being
given
to
bates
in
a
pannikin
he
drank
it
eagerly
but
vomited
it
almost
instantly
it
was
evident
that
he
was
sinking
from
some
internal
injury
none
of
the
party
had
much
appetite
for
breakfast
but
frere
whose
sensibilities
were
less
acute
than
those
of
the
others
ate
a
piece
of
salt
meat
and
damper
it
struck
him
with
a
curious
feeling
of
pleasant
selfishness
that
now
grimes
had
gone
the
allowance
of
provisions
would
be
increased
and
that
if
bates
went
also
it
would
be
increased
still
further
he
did
not
give
utterance
to
his
thoughts
however
but
sat
with
the
wounded
man
head
on
his
knees
and
brushed
the
settling
flies
from
his
face
he
hoped
after
all
that
the
pilot
would
not
die
for
he
should
then
be
left
alone
to
look
after
the
women
perhaps
some
such
thought
was
agitating
vickers
also
as
for
sylvia
she
made
no
secret
of
her
anxiety
do
die
bates
oh
do
die
she
said
standing
piteously
near
but
afraid
to
touch
him
do
leave
mamma
and
me
alone
in
this
dreadful
place
poor
bates
of
course
said
nothing
but
frere
frowned
heavily
and
vickers
said
reprovingly
sylvia
just
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
old
house
on
distant
sarah
island
in
the
afternoon
frere
went
away
to
drag
together
some
wood
for
the
fire
and
when
he
returned
he
found
the
pilot
near
his
end
vickers
said
that
for
an
hour
he
had
lain
without
motion
and
almost
without
breath
the
major
wife
had
seen
more
than
one
and
was
calm
enough
but
poor
little
sylvia
sitting
on
a
stone
hard
by
shook
with
terror
she
had
a
dim
notion
that
death
must
be
accompanied
by
violence
as
the
sun
sank
bates
rallied
but
the
two
watchers
knew
that
it
was
but
the
final
flicker
of
the
expiring
candle
he
going
said
frere
at
length
under
his
breath
as
though
fearful
of
awaking
his
soul
vickers
her
eyes
streaming
with
silent
tears
lifted
the
honest
head
and
moistened
the
parched
lips
with
her
soaked
handkerchief
a
tremor
shook
the
once
stalwart
limbs
and
the
dying
man
opened
his
eyes
for
an
instant
he
seemed
bewildered
and
then
looking
from
one
to
the
other
intelligence
returned
to
his
glance
and
it
was
evident
that
he
remembered
all
his
gaze
rested
upon
the
pale
face
of
the
affrighted
sylvia
and
then
turned
to
frere
there
could
be
no
mistaking
the
mute
appeal
of
those
eloquent
eyes
yes
i
take
care
of
her
said
frere
bates
smiled
and
then
observing
that
the
blood
from
his
wound
had
stained
the
white
shawl
of
vickers
he
made
an
effort
to
move
his
head
it
was
not
fitting
that
a
lady
shawl
should
be
stained
with
the
blood
of
a
poor
fellow
like
himself
the
fashionable
fribble
with
quick
instinct
understood
the
gesture
and
gently
drew
the
head
back
upon
her
bosom
in
the
presence
of
death
the
woman
was
womanly
for
a
moment
all
was
silent
and
they
thought
he
had
gone
but
all
at
once
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
round
for
the
sea
turn
my
face
to
it
once
more
he
whispered
and
as
they
raised
him
he
inclined
his
ear
to
listen
it
calm
enough
here
god
bless
it
he
said
but
i
can
hear
the
waves
hard
upon
the
bar
and
so
his
head
dropped
and
he
died
as
frere
relieved
vickers
from
the
weight
of
the
corpse
sylvia
ran
to
her
mother
oh
mamma
mamma
she
cried
why
did
god
let
him
die
when
we
wanted
him
so
much
before
it
grew
dark
frere
made
shift
to
carry
the
body
to
the
shelter
of
some
rocks
at
a
little
distance
and
spreading
the
jacket
over
the
face
he
piled
stones
upon
it
to
keep
it
steady
the
march
of
events
had
been
so
rapid
that
he
scarcely
realized
that
since
the
previous
evening
two
of
the
five
human
creatures
left
in
this
wilderness
had
escaped
from
it
as
he
did
realize
it
he
began
to
wonder
whose
turn
it
would
be
next
vickers
worn
out
by
the
fatigue
and
excitement
of
the
day
retired
to
rest
early
and
sylvia
refusing
to
speak
to
frere
followed
her
mother
this
manifestation
of
unaccountable
dislike
on
the
part
of
the
child
hurt
maurice
more
than
he
cared
to
own
he
felt
angry
with
her
for
not
loving
him
and
yet
he
took
no
pains
to
conciliate
her
it
was
with
a
curious
pleasure
that
he
remembered
how
she
must
soon
look
up
to
him
as
her
chief
protector
had
sylvia
been
just
a
few
years
older
the
young
man
would
have
thought
himself
in
love
with
her
the
following
day
passed
gloomily
it
was
hot
and
sultry
and
a
dull
haze
hung
over
the
mountains
frere
spent
the
morning
in
scooping
a
grave
in
the
sand
in
which
to
inter
poor
bates
practically
awake
to
his
own
necessities
he
removed
such
portions
of
clothing
from
the
body
as
would
be
useful
to
him
but
hid
them
under
a
stone
not
liking
to
let
vickers
see
what
he
had
done
having
completed
the
grave
by
midday
he
placed
the
corpse
therein
and
rolled
as
many
stones
as
possible
to
the
sides
of
the
mound
in
the
afternoon
he
cast
the
fishing
line
from
the
point
of
a
rock
he
had
marked
the
day
before
but
caught
nothing
passing
by
the
grave
on
his
return
he
noticed
that
vickers
had
placed
at
the
head
of
it
a
rude
cross
formed
by
tying
two
pieces
of
stick
together
after
supper
the
usual
salt
meat
and
damper
he
lit
an
economical
pipe
and
tried
to
talk
to
sylvia
why
wo
you
be
friends
with
me
missy
he
asked
i
do
like
you
said
sylvia
you
frighten
why
you
are
not
kind
i
do
mean
that
you
do
cruel
things
but
you
are
oh
i
wish
papa
was
here
wishing
wo
bring
him
says
frere
pressing
his
hoarded
tobacco
together
with
prudent
forefinger
there
that
what
i
mean
is
that
kind
wo
bring
him
oh
if
it
only
would
i
did
mean
it
unkindly
says
frere
what
a
strange
child
you
there
are
persons
says
sylvia
who
have
no
affinity
for
each
other
i
read
about
it
in
a
book
papa
had
and
i
suppose
that
what
it
is
i
have
no
affinity
for
you
i
ca
help
it
can
i
rubbish
frere
returned
come
here
and
i
tell
you
a
vickers
had
gone
back
to
her
cave
and
the
two
were
alone
by
the
fire
near
which
stood
the
kettle
and
the
damper
the
child
with
some
show
of
hesitation
came
to
him
and
he
caught
and
placed
her
on
his
knee
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
shadows
cast
by
the
flickering
fire
seemed
weird
and
monstrous
the
wicked
wish
to
frighten
this
helpless
creature
came
to
maurice
frere
there
was
once
said
he
a
castle
in
an
old
wood
and
in
this
castle
there
lived
an
ogre
with
great
goggle
you
silly
man
said
sylvia
struggling
to
be
free
you
are
trying
to
frighten
me
and
this
ogre
lived
on
the
bones
of
little
girls
one
day
a
little
girl
was
travelling
the
wood
and
she
heard
the
ogre
coming
haw
haw
haw
mr
frere
let
me
down
she
was
terribly
frightened
and
she
ran
and
ran
and
ran
until
all
of
a
sudden
she
saw
a
piercing
scream
burst
from
his
companion
oh
oh
what
that
she
cried
and
clung
to
her
persecutor
beyond
the
fire
stood
the
figure
of
a
man
he
staggered
forward
and
then
falling
on
his
knees
stretched
out
his
hands
and
hoarsely
articulated
one
word
it
was
rufus
dawes
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
broke
the
spell
of
terror
that
was
on
the
child
and
as
the
glow
from
the
fire
fell
upon
the
tattered
yellow
garments
she
guessed
at
once
the
whole
story
not
so
maurice
frere
he
saw
before
him
a
new
danger
a
new
mouth
to
share
the
scanty
provision
and
snatching
a
brand
from
the
fire
he
kept
the
convict
at
bay
but
rufus
dawes
glaring
round
with
wolfish
eyes
caught
sight
of
the
damper
resting
against
the
iron
kettle
and
made
a
clutch
at
it
frere
dashed
the
brand
in
his
face
stand
back
he
cried
we
have
no
food
to
spare
the
convict
uttered
a
savage
cry
and
raising
the
iron
gad
plunged
forward
desperately
to
attack
this
new
enemy
but
quick
as
thought
the
child
glided
past
frere
and
snatching
the
loaf
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
starving
man
with
here
poor
prisoner
eat
and
then
turning
to
frere
she
cast
upon
him
a
glance
so
full
of
horror
indignation
and
surprise
that
the
man
blushed
and
threw
down
the
brand
as
for
rufus
dawes
the
sudden
apparition
of
this
girl
seemed
to
have
transformed
him
allowing
the
loaf
to
slip
through
his
fingers
he
gazed
with
haggard
eyes
at
the
retreating
figure
of
the
child
and
as
it
vanished
into
the
darkness
outside
the
circle
of
firelight
the
unhappy
man
sank
his
face
upon
his
blackened
horny
hands
and
burst
into
tears
chapter
xii
dawes
the
coarse
tones
of
maurice
frere
roused
him
what
do
you
want
he
asked
rufus
dawes
raising
his
head
contemplated
the
figure
before
him
and
recognized
it
is
it
you
he
said
slowly
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
me
asked
frere
drawing
back
but
the
convict
did
not
reply
his
momentary
emotion
passed
away
the
pangs
of
hunger
returned
and
greedily
seizing
upon
the
piece
of
damper
he
began
to
eat
in
silence
do
you
hear
man
repeated
frere
at
length
what
are
you
an
escaped
prisoner
you
can
give
me
up
in
the
morning
i
done
my
best
and
i
the
sentence
struck
frere
with
dismay
the
man
did
not
know
that
the
settlement
had
been
abandoned
i
can
not
give
you
up
there
is
no
one
but
myself
and
a
woman
and
child
on
the
rufus
dawes
pausing
in
his
eating
stared
at
him
in
amazement
the
prisoners
have
gone
away
in
the
schooner
if
you
choose
to
remain
free
you
can
do
so
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
am
as
helpless
as
you
but
how
do
you
come
here
frere
laughed
bitterly
to
give
explanations
to
convicts
was
foreign
to
his
experience
and
he
did
not
relish
the
task
in
this
case
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
prisoners
mutinied
and
seized
the
what
brig
the
a
terrible
light
broke
upon
rufus
dawes
and
he
began
to
understand
how
he
had
again
missed
his
chance
who
took
her
that
villain
john
rex
says
frere
giving
vent
to
his
passion
may
she
sink
and
burn
and
have
they
gone
then
cried
the
miserable
man
clutching
at
his
hair
with
a
gesture
of
hopeless
rage
yes
two
days
ago
and
left
us
here
to
rufus
dawes
burst
into
a
laugh
so
discordant
that
it
made
the
other
shudder
we
starve
together
maurice
frere
said
he
for
while
you
a
crust
i
share
it
if
i
do
get
liberty
at
least
i
have
revenge
the
sinister
aspect
of
this
famished
savage
sitting
with
his
chin
on
his
ragged
knees
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
in
the
light
of
the
fire
gave
maurice
frere
a
new
sensation
he
felt
as
might
have
felt
that
african
hunter
who
returning
to
his
camp
fire
found
a
lion
there
wretch
said
he
shrinking
from
him
why
should
you
wish
to
be
revenged
on
me
the
convict
turned
upon
him
with
a
snarl
take
care
what
you
say
have
no
hard
words
wretch
if
i
am
a
wretch
who
made
me
one
if
i
hate
you
and
myself
and
the
world
who
made
me
hate
it
i
was
born
free
as
free
as
you
are
why
should
i
be
sent
to
herd
with
beasts
and
condemned
to
this
slavery
worse
than
death
tell
me
that
maurice
frere
tell
me
that
i
did
make
the
laws
says
frere
why
do
you
attack
me
because
you
are
what
i
was
you
are
free
you
can
do
as
you
please
you
can
love
you
can
work
you
can
think
i
can
only
hate
he
paused
as
if
astonished
at
himself
and
then
continued
with
a
low
laugh
fine
words
for
a
convict
eh
but
never
mind
it
all
right
frere
equal
now
and
i
die
an
hour
sooner
than
you
though
you
are
a
man
frere
began
to
think
that
he
was
dealing
with
another
madman
die
there
no
need
to
talk
of
dying
he
said
as
soothingly
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
say
it
time
enough
for
that
there
spoke
the
free
man
we
convicts
have
an
advantage
over
you
gentlemen
you
are
afraid
of
death
we
pray
for
it
it
is
the
best
thing
that
can
happen
to
us
die
they
were
going
to
hang
me
once
i
wish
they
had
my
god
i
wish
they
had
there
was
such
a
depth
of
agony
in
this
terrible
utterance
that
maurice
frere
was
appalled
at
it
there
go
and
sleep
my
man
he
said
you
are
knocked
up
we
talk
in
the
hold
on
a
bit
cried
rufus
dawes
with
a
coarseness
of
manner
altogether
foreign
to
that
he
had
just
assumed
who
with
ye
the
wife
and
daughter
of
the
commandant
replied
frere
half
afraid
to
refuse
an
answer
to
a
question
so
fiercely
put
no
one
else
poor
souls
said
the
convict
i
pity
and
then
he
stretched
himself
like
a
dog
before
the
blaze
and
went
to
sleep
instantly
maurice
frere
looking
at
the
gaunt
figure
of
this
addition
to
the
party
was
completely
puzzled
how
to
act
such
a
character
had
never
before
come
within
the
range
of
his
experience
he
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
fierce
ragged
desperate
man
who
wept
and
threatened
by
turns
who
was
now
snarling
in
the
most
repulsive
bass
of
the
convict
gamut
and
now
calling
upon
heaven
in
tones
which
were
little
less
than
eloquent
at
first
he
thought
of
precipitating
himself
upon
the
sleeping
wretch
and
pinioning
him
but
a
second
glance
at
the
sinewy
though
wasted
limbs
forbade
him
to
follow
out
the
rash
suggestion
of
his
own
fears
then
a
horrible
prompting
arising
out
of
his
former
cowardice
made
him
feel
for
the
with
which
one
murder
had
already
been
committed
their
stock
of
provisions
was
so
scanty
and
after
all
the
lives
of
the
woman
and
child
were
worth
more
than
that
of
this
unknown
desperado
but
to
do
him
justice
the
thought
no
sooner
shaped
itself
than
he
crushed
it
out
we
wait
till
morning
and
see
how
he
shapes
said
frere
to
himself
and
pausing
at
the
brushwood
barricade
behind
which
the
mother
and
daughter
were
clinging
to
each
other
he
whispered
that
he
was
on
guard
outside
and
that
the
absconder
slept
but
when
morning
dawned
he
found
that
there
was
no
need
for
alarm
the
convict
was
lying
in
almost
the
same
position
as
that
in
which
he
had
left
him
and
his
eyes
were
closed
his
threatening
outbreak
of
the
previous
night
had
been
produced
by
the
excitement
of
his
sudden
rescue
and
he
was
now
incapable
of
violence
frere
advanced
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
not
alive
cried
the
poor
wretch
waking
with
a
start
and
raising
his
arm
to
strike
keep
off
it
all
right
said
frere
no
one
is
going
to
harm
you
wake
rufus
dawes
glanced
around
him
stupidly
and
then
remembering
what
had
happened
with
a
great
effort
he
staggered
to
his
feet
i
thought
they
got
me
he
said
but
it
the
other
way
i
see
come
have
breakfast
frere
i
you
must
wait
said
frere
do
you
think
there
is
no
one
here
but
yourself
rufus
dawes
swaying
to
and
fro
from
weakness
passed
his
shred
of
a
cuff
over
his
eyes
i
do
know
anything
about
it
i
only
know
frere
stopped
short
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
settle
future
relations
lying
awake
in
the
night
with
the
ready
to
his
hand
he
had
decided
on
the
course
of
action
that
must
be
adopted
the
convict
should
share
with
the
rest
but
no
more
if
he
rebelled
at
that
there
must
be
a
trial
of
strength
between
them
look
you
here
he
said
we
have
but
barely
enough
food
to
serve
us
until
help
comes
if
it
does
come
i
have
the
care
of
that
poor
woman
and
child
and
i
will
see
fair
play
for
their
sakes
you
shall
share
with
us
to
our
last
bit
and
drop
but
by
heaven
you
shall
get
no
the
convict
stretching
out
his
wasted
arms
looked
down
upon
them
with
the
uncertain
gaze
of
a
drunken
man
i
am
weak
now
he
said
you
have
the
best
of
me
and
then
he
sank
suddenly
down
upon
the
ground
exhausted
give
me
a
drink
he
moaned
feebly
motioning
with
his
hand
frere
got
him
water
in
the
pannikin
and
having
drunk
it
he
smiled
and
lay
down
to
sleep
again
vickers
and
sylvia
coming
out
while
he
still
slept
recognized
him
as
the
desperado
of
the
settlement
he
was
the
most
desperate
man
we
had
said
vickers
identifying
herself
with
her
husband
oh
what
shall
we
do
he
wo
do
much
harm
returned
frere
looking
down
at
the
notorious
ruffian
with
curiosity
he
as
near
dead
as
can
sylvia
looked
up
at
him
with
her
clear
child
glance
we
must
let
him
die
said
she
that
would
be
no
no
returned
frere
hastily
no
one
wants
him
to
die
but
what
can
we
do
i
nurse
him
cried
sylvia
frere
broke
into
one
of
his
coarse
laughs
the
first
one
that
he
had
indulged
in
since
the
mutiny
you
nurse
him
by
george
that
a
good
one
the
poor
little
child
weak
and
excitable
felt
the
contempt
in
the
tone
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobs
why
do
you
insult
me
you
wicked
man
the
poor
fellow
ill
and
he
he
die
like
bates
oh
mamma
mamma
let
go
away
by
frere
swore
a
great
oath
and
walked
away
he
went
into
the
little
wood
under
the
cliff
and
sat
down
he
was
full
of
strange
thoughts
which
he
could
not
express
and
which
he
had
never
owned
before
the
dislike
the
child
bore
to
him
made
him
miserable
and
yet
he
took
delight
in
tormenting
her
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
acted
the
part
of
a
coward
the
night
before
in
endeavouring
to
frighten
her
and
that
the
detestation
she
bore
him
was
well
earned
but
he
had
fully
determined
to
stake
his
life
in
her
defence
should
the
savage
who
had
thus
come
upon
them
out
of
the
desert
attempt
violence
and
he
was
unreasonably
angry
at
the
pity
she
had
shown
it
was
not
fair
to
be
thus
misinterpreted
but
he
had
done
wrong
to
swear
and
more
so
in
quitting
them
so
abruptly
the
consciousness
of
his
however
only
made
him
more
confirmed
in
it
his
native
obstinacy
would
not
allow
him
to
retract
what
he
had
said
even
to
himself
walking
along
he
came
to
bates
grave
and
the
cross
upon
it
here
was
another
evidence
of
she
had
always
preferred
bates
now
that
bates
was
gone
she
must
needs
transfer
her
childish
affections
to
a
convict
oh
said
frere
to
himself
with
pleasant
recollections
of
many
coarse
triumphs
in
if
you
were
a
woman
you
little
vixen
i
make
you
love
me
when
he
had
said
this
he
laughed
at
himself
for
his
folly
he
was
turning
romantic
when
he
got
back
he
found
dawes
stretched
upon
the
brushwood
with
sylvia
sitting
near
him
he
is
better
said
vickers
disdaining
to
refer
to
the
scene
of
the
morning
sit
down
and
have
something
to
eat
are
you
better
asked
frere
abruptly
to
his
surprise
the
convict
answered
quite
civilly
i
shall
be
strong
again
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
i
can
help
you
help
me
how
to
build
a
hut
here
for
the
ladies
and
we
live
here
all
our
lives
and
never
go
back
to
the
sheds
any
he
has
been
wandering
a
little
said
vickers
poor
fellow
he
seems
quite
well
the
convict
began
to
sing
a
little
german
song
and
to
beat
the
refrain
with
his
hand
frere
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
i
wonder
what
the
story
of
that
man
life
has
been
he
said
a
queer
one
i
be
sylvia
looked
up
at
him
with
a
forgiving
smile
i
ask
him
when
he
gets
well
she
said
and
if
you
are
good
i
tell
you
frere
accepted
the
proffered
friendship
i
am
a
great
brute
sylvia
sometimes
ai
i
he
said
but
i
do
mean
you
are
returned
sylvia
frankly
but
let
shake
hands
and
be
friends
it
no
use
quarrelling
when
there
are
only
four
of
us
is
it
and
in
this
way
was
rufus
dawes
admitted
a
member
of
the
family
circle
within
a
week
from
the
night
on
which
he
had
seen
the
smoke
of
fire
the
convict
had
recovered
his
strength
and
had
become
an
important
personage
the
distrust
with
which
he
had
been
at
first
viewed
had
worn
off
and
he
was
no
longer
an
outcast
to
be
shunned
and
pointed
at
or
to
be
referred
to
in
whispers
he
had
abandoned
his
rough
manner
and
no
longer
threatened
or
complained
and
though
at
times
a
profound
melancholy
would
oppress
him
his
spirits
were
more
even
than
those
of
frere
who
was
often
moody
sullen
and
overbearing
rufus
dawes
was
no
longer
the
brutalized
wretch
who
had
plunged
into
the
dark
waters
of
the
bay
to
escape
a
life
he
loathed
and
had
alternately
cursed
and
wept
in
the
solitudes
of
the
forests
he
was
an
active
member
of
society
a
society
of
four
and
he
began
to
regain
an
air
of
independence
and
authority
this
change
had
been
wrought
by
the
influence
of
little
sylvia
recovered
from
the
weakness
consequent
upon
this
terrible
journey
rufus
dawes
had
experienced
for
the
first
time
in
six
years
the
soothing
power
of
kindness
he
had
now
an
object
to
live
for
beyond
himself
he
was
of
use
to
somebody
and
had
he
died
he
would
have
been
regretted
to
us
this
means
little
to
this
unhappy
man
it
meant
everything
he
found
to
his
astonishment
that
he
was
not
despised
and
that
by
the
strange
concurrence
of
circumstances
he
had
been
brought
into
a
position
in
which
his
convict
experiences
gave
him
authority
he
was
skilled
in
all
the
mysteries
of
the
prison
sheds
he
knew
how
to
sustain
life
on
as
little
food
as
possible
he
could
fell
trees
without
an
axe
bake
bread
without
an
oven
build
a
weatherproof
hut
without
bricks
or
mortar
from
the
patient
he
became
the
adviser
and
from
the
adviser
the
commander
in
the
state
to
which
these
four
human
beings
had
been
brought
he
found
that
savage
accomplishments
were
of
most
value
might
was
right
and
maurice
frere
authority
of
gentility
soon
succumbed
to
rufus
dawes
authority
of
knowledge
as
the
time
wore
on
and
the
scanty
stock
of
provisions
decreased
he
found
that
his
authority
grew
more
and
more
powerful
did
a
question
arise
as
to
the
qualities
of
a
strange
plant
it
was
rufus
dawes
who
could
pronounce
upon
it
were
fish
to
be
caught
it
was
rufus
dawes
who
caught
them
did
vickers
complain
of
the
instability
of
her
brushwood
hut
it
was
rufus
dawes
who
worked
a
wicker
shield
and
plastering
it
with
clay
produced
a
wall
that
defied
the
keenest
wind
he
made
cups
out
of
and
plates
out
of
he
worked
harder
than
any
three
men
nothing
daunted
him
nothing
discouraged
him
when
vickers
fell
sick
from
anxiety
and
insufficient
food
it
was
rufus
dawes
who
gathered
fresh
leaves
for
her
couch
who
cheered
her
by
hopeful
words
who
voluntarily
gave
up
half
his
own
allowance
of
meat
that
she
might
grow
stronger
on
it
the
poor
woman
and
her
child
called
him
dawes
frere
watched
all
this
with
dissatisfaction
that
amounted
at
times
to
positive
hatred
yet
he
could
say
nothing
for
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
beside
dawes
he
was
incapable
he
even
submitted
to
take
orders
from
this
escaped
convict
it
was
so
evident
that
the
escaped
convict
knew
better
than
he
sylvia
began
to
look
upon
dawes
as
a
second
bates
he
was
moreover
all
her
own
she
had
an
interest
in
him
for
she
had
nursed
and
protected
him
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
this
prodigy
would
not
have
lived
he
felt
for
her
an
absorbing
affection
that
was
almost
a
passion
she
was
his
good
angel
his
protectress
his
glimpse
of
heaven
she
had
given
him
food
when
he
was
starving
and
had
believed
in
him
when
the
world
the
world
of
four
had
looked
coldly
on
him
he
would
have
died
for
her
and
for
love
of
her
hoped
for
the
vessel
which
should
take
her
back
to
freedom
and
give
him
again
into
bondage
but
the
days
stole
on
and
no
vessel
appeared
each
day
they
eagerly
scanned
the
watery
horizon
each
day
they
longed
to
behold
the
bowsprit
of
the
returning
ladybird
glide
past
the
jutting
rock
that
shut
out
the
view
of
the
harbour
but
in
vain
vickers
illness
increased
and
the
stock
of
provisions
began
to
run
short
dawes
talked
of
putting
himself
and
frere
on
half
allowance
it
was
evident
that
unless
succour
came
in
a
few
days
they
must
starve
frere
mooted
all
sorts
of
wild
plans
for
obtaining
food
he
would
make
a
journey
to
the
settlement
and
swimming
the
estuary
search
if
haply
any
casks
of
biscuit
had
been
left
behind
in
the
hurry
of
departure
he
would
set
springes
for
the
seagulls
and
snare
the
pigeons
at
liberty
point
but
all
these
proved
impracticable
and
with
blank
faces
they
watched
their
bag
of
flour
grow
smaller
and
smaller
daily
then
the
notion
of
escape
was
broached
could
they
construct
a
raft
impossible
without
nails
or
ropes
could
they
build
a
boat
equally
impossible
for
the
same
reason
could
they
raise
a
fire
sufficient
to
signal
a
ship
easily
but
what
ship
would
come
within
reach
of
that
spot
nothing
could
be
done
but
wait
for
a
vessel
which
was
sure
to
come
for
them
sooner
or
later
and
growing
weaker
day
by
day
they
waited
one
morning
sylvia
was
sitting
in
the
sun
reading
the
english
history
which
by
the
accident
of
fright
she
had
brought
with
her
on
the
night
of
the
mutiny
mr
frere
said
she
suddenly
what
is
an
alchemist
a
man
who
makes
gold
was
frere
not
very
accurate
definition
do
you
know
one
do
you
dawes
i
knew
a
man
once
who
thought
himself
what
a
man
who
made
gold
after
a
but
did
he
make
gold
persisted
sylvia
no
not
absolutely
make
it
but
he
was
in
his
worship
of
money
an
alchemist
for
all
what
became
of
him
i
do
know
said
dawes
with
so
much
constraint
in
his
tone
that
the
child
instinctively
turned
the
subject
then
alchemy
is
a
very
old
art
oh
did
the
ancient
britons
know
it
no
not
as
old
as
that
sylvia
suddenly
gave
a
little
scream
the
remembrance
of
the
evening
when
she
read
about
the
ancient
britons
to
poor
bates
came
vividly
into
her
mind
and
though
she
had
since
the
passage
that
had
then
attracted
her
attention
a
hundred
times
it
had
never
before
presented
itself
to
her
in
its
full
significance
hurriedly
turning
the
leaves
she
read
aloud
the
passage
which
had
provoked
remark
ancient
britons
were
little
better
than
barbarians
they
painted
their
bodies
with
woad
and
seated
in
their
light
coracles
of
skin
stretched
upon
slender
wooden
frames
must
have
presented
a
wild
and
savage
appearance
a
coracle
that
a
boat
ca
we
make
a
coracle

chapter
xiii
what
the
seaweed
suggested
the
question
gave
the
marooned
party
new
hopes
maurice
frere
with
his
usual
impetuosity
declared
that
the
project
was
a
most
feasible
one
and
wondered
as
such
men
will
wonder
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
it
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
he
cried
sylvia
you
have
saved
us
but
upon
taking
the
matter
into
more
earnest
consideration
it
became
apparent
that
they
were
as
yet
a
long
way
from
the
realization
of
their
hopes
to
make
a
coracle
of
skins
seemed
sufficiently
easy
but
how
to
obtain
the
skins
the
one
miserable
hide
of
the
unlucky
was
utterly
inadequate
for
the
purpose
sylvia
her
face
beaming
with
the
hope
of
escape
and
with
delight
at
having
been
the
means
of
suggesting
it
watched
narrowly
the
countenance
of
rufus
dawes
but
she
marked
no
answering
gleam
of
joy
in
those
eyes
ca
it
be
done
dawes
she
asked
trembling
for
the
reply
the
convict
knitted
his
brows
gloomily
come
dawes
cried
frere
forgetting
his
enmity
for
an
instant
in
the
flash
of
new
hope
ca
you
suggest
something
rufus
dawes
thus
appealed
to
as
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
little
society
felt
a
pleasant
thrill
of
i
do
know
he
said
i
must
think
of
it
it
looks
easy
and
yet
he
paused
as
something
in
the
water
caught
his
eye
it
was
a
mass
of
bladdery
seaweed
that
the
returning
tide
was
wafting
slowly
to
the
shore
this
object
which
would
have
passed
unnoticed
at
any
other
time
suggested
to
rufus
dawes
a
new
idea
yes
he
added
slowly
with
a
change
of
tone
it
may
be
done
i
think
i
can
see
my
the
others
preserved
a
respectful
silence
until
he
should
speak
again
how
far
do
you
think
it
is
across
the
bay
he
asked
of
frere
what
to
sarah
island
no
to
the
pilot
about
four
the
convict
sighed
too
far
to
swim
now
though
i
might
have
done
it
once
but
this
sort
of
life
weakens
a
man
it
must
be
done
after
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
frere
to
kill
the
sylvia
uttered
a
little
cry
she
had
become
fond
of
her
dumb
companion
kill
nanny
oh
dawes
what
for
i
am
going
to
make
a
boat
for
you
he
said
and
i
want
hides
and
thread
and
a
few
weeks
back
maurice
frere
would
have
laughed
at
such
a
sentence
but
he
had
begun
now
to
comprehend
that
this
escaped
convict
was
not
a
man
to
be
laughed
at
and
though
he
detested
him
for
his
superiority
he
could
not
but
admit
that
he
was
superior
you
ca
get
more
than
one
hide
off
a
goat
man
he
said
with
an
inquiring
tone
in
his
voice
as
though
it
was
just
possible
that
such
a
marvellous
being
as
dawes
could
get
a
second
hide
by
virtue
of
some
secret
process
known
only
to
himself
i
am
going
to
catch
other
where
at
the
pilot
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
there
float
across
come
there
is
not
time
for
questioning
go
and
cut
down
some
saplings
and
let
us
begin
the
looked
at
the
convict
prisoner
with
astonishment
and
then
gave
way
to
the
power
of
knowledge
and
did
as
he
was
ordered
before
sundown
that
evening
the
carcase
of
poor
nanny
broken
into
various
most
unbutcherly
fragments
was
hanging
on
the
nearest
tree
and
frere
returning
with
as
many
young
saplings
as
he
could
drag
together
found
rufus
dawes
engaged
in
a
curious
occupation
he
had
killed
the
goat
and
having
cut
off
its
head
close
under
the
jaws
and
its
legs
at
the
had
extracted
the
carcase
through
a
slit
made
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
belly
which
slit
he
had
now
sewn
together
with
string
this
proceeding
gave
him
a
rough
bag
and
he
was
busily
engaged
in
filling
this
bag
with
such
coarse
grass
as
he
could
collect
frere
observed
also
that
the
fat
of
the
animal
was
carefully
preserved
and
the
intestines
had
been
placed
in
a
pool
of
water
to
soak
the
convict
however
declined
to
give
information
as
to
what
he
intended
to
do
it
my
own
notion
he
said
let
me
alone
i
may
make
a
failure
of
frere
on
being
pressed
by
sylvia
affected
to
know
all
about
the
scheme
but
to
impose
silence
on
himself
he
was
galled
to
think
that
a
convict
brain
should
contain
a
mystery
which
he
might
not
share
on
the
next
day
by
rufus
dawes
direction
frere
cut
down
some
rushes
that
grew
about
a
mile
from
the
camping
ground
and
brought
them
in
on
his
back
this
took
him
nearly
half
a
day
to
accomplish
short
rations
were
beginning
to
tell
upon
his
physical
powers
the
convict
on
the
other
hand
trained
by
a
woeful
experience
in
the
boats
to
endurance
of
hardship
was
slowly
recovering
his
original
strength
what
are
they
for
asked
frere
as
he
flung
the
bundles
down
his
master
condescended
to
reply
to
make
a
well
the
other
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
you
are
very
dull
frere
i
am
going
to
swim
over
to
the
pilot
station
and
catch
some
of
those
goats
i
can
get
across
on
the
stuffed
skin
but
i
must
float
them
back
on
the
how
the
doose
do
you
mean
to
catch
asked
frere
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
the
convict
motioned
to
him
to
approach
he
did
so
and
saw
that
his
companion
was
cleaning
the
intestines
of
the
goat
the
outer
membrane
having
been
peeled
off
rufus
dawes
was
turning
the
gut
inside
out
this
he
did
by
turning
up
a
short
piece
of
it
as
though
it
were
a
and
dipping
the
cuff
into
a
pool
of
water
the
weight
of
the
water
pressing
between
the
cuff
and
the
rest
of
the
gut
bore
down
a
further
portion
and
so
by
repeated
dippings
the
whole
length
was
turned
inside
out
the
inner
membrane
having
been
scraped
away
there
remained
a
fine
transparent
tube
which
was
tightly
twisted
and
set
to
dry
in
the
sun
there
is
the
catgut
for
the
noose
said
dawes
i
learnt
that
trick
at
the
settlement
now
come
frere
following
saw
that
a
fire
had
been
made
between
two
stones
and
that
the
kettle
was
partly
sunk
in
the
ground
near
it
on
approaching
the
kettle
he
found
it
full
of
smooth
pebbles
take
out
those
stones
said
dawes
frere
obeyed
and
saw
at
the
bottom
of
the
kettle
a
quantity
of
sparkling
white
powder
and
the
sides
of
the
vessel
crusted
with
the
same
material
what
that
he
asked
how
did
you
get
it
i
filled
the
kettle
with
and
then
heating
those
pebbles
in
the
fire
dropped
them
into
it
we
could
have
caught
the
steam
in
a
cloth
and
wrung
out
fresh
water
had
we
wished
to
do
so
but
thank
god
we
have
frere
started
did
you
learn
that
at
the
settlement
too
he
asked
rufus
dawes
laughed
with
a
sort
of
bitterness
in
his
tones
do
you
think
i
have
been
at
settlement
all
my
life
the
thing
is
very
simple
it
is
merely
frere
burst
out
in
sudden
fretful
admiration
what
a
fellow
you
are
dawes
what
are
you
i
mean
what
have
you
been
a
triumphant
light
came
into
the
other
face
and
for
the
instant
he
seemed
about
to
make
some
startling
revelation
but
the
light
faded
and
he
checked
himself
with
a
gesture
of
pain
i
am
a
convict
never
mind
what
i
have
been
a
sailor
a
shipbuilder
prodigal
vagabond
what
does
it
matter
it
wo
alter
my
fate
will
it
if
we
get
safely
back
says
frere
i
ask
for
a
free
pardon
for
you
you
deserve
come
returned
dawes
with
a
discordant
laugh
let
us
wait
until
we
get
you
do
believe
me
i
do
want
favour
at
your
hands
he
said
with
a
return
of
the
old
fierceness
let
us
get
to
work
bring
up
the
rushes
here
and
tie
them
with
a
fishing
at
this
instant
sylvia
came
up
good
afternoon
dawes
hard
at
work
oh
what
this
in
the
kettle
the
voice
of
the
child
acted
like
a
charm
upon
rufus
dawes
he
smiled
quite
cheerfully
salt
miss
i
am
going
to
catch
the
goats
with
catch
the
goats
how
put
it
on
their
tails
she
cried
merrily
goats
are
fond
of
salt
and
when
i
get
over
to
the
pilot
station
i
shall
set
traps
for
them
baited
with
this
salt
when
they
come
to
lick
it
i
shall
have
a
noose
of
catgut
ready
to
catch
them
do
you
understand
but
how
will
you
get
across
you
will
see
chapter
xiv
a
wonderful
day
work
the
next
morning
rufus
dawes
was
stirring
by
daylight
he
first
got
his
catgut
wound
upon
a
piece
of
stick
and
then
having
moved
his
frail
floats
alongside
the
little
rock
that
served
as
a
pier
he
took
a
fishing
line
and
a
larger
piece
of
stick
and
proceeded
to
draw
a
diagram
on
the
sand
this
diagram
when
completed
represented
a
rude
outline
of
a
punt
eight
feet
long
and
three
broad
at
certain
distances
were
eight
points
four
on
each
side
into
which
small
willow
rods
were
driven
he
then
awoke
frere
and
showed
the
diagram
to
him
get
eight
stakes
of
pine
he
said
you
can
burn
them
where
you
can
not
cut
them
and
drive
a
stake
into
the
place
of
each
of
these
willow
wands
when
you
have
done
that
collect
as
many
willows
as
you
can
get
i
shall
not
be
back
until
tonight
now
give
me
a
hand
with
the
frere
coming
to
the
pier
saw
dawes
strip
himself
and
piling
his
clothes
upon
the
stuffed
stretch
himself
upon
the
reed
bundles
and
paddling
with
his
hands
push
off
from
the
shore
the
clothes
floated
high
and
dry
but
the
reeds
depressed
by
the
weight
of
the
body
sank
so
that
the
head
of
the
convict
alone
appeared
above
water
in
this
fashion
he
gained
the
middle
of
the
current
and
the
tide
swept
him
down
towards
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
frere
sulkily
admiring
went
back
to
prepare
the
breakfast
they
were
on
half
rations
now
dawes
having
forbidden
the
slaughtered
goat
to
be
eaten
lest
his
expedition
should
prove
unsuccessful
wondering
at
the
chance
which
had
thrown
this
convict
in
his
way
parsons
would
call
it
special
providence
he
said
to
himself
for
if
it
had
been
for
him
we
should
never
have
got
thus
far
if
his
succeeds
all
right
i
suppose
he
a
clever
dog
i
wonder
who
he
his
training
as
a
master
of
convicts
made
him
think
how
dangerous
such
a
man
would
be
on
a
convict
station
it
would
be
difficult
to
keep
a
fellow
of
such
resources
they
have
to
look
pretty
sharp
after
him
if
they
ever
get
him
back
he
thought
i
have
a
fine
tale
to
tell
of
his
the
conversation
of
the
previous
day
occurred
to
him
i
promised
to
ask
for
a
free
pardon
he
would
have
it
though
too
proud
to
accept
it
at
my
hands
wait
until
we
get
back
i
teach
him
his
place
for
after
all
it
is
his
own
liberty
that
he
is
working
for
as
well
as
mine
i
mean
then
a
thought
came
into
his
head
that
was
in
every
way
worthy
of
him
suppose
we
took
the
boat
and
left
him
behind
the
notion
seemed
so
ludicrously
wicked
that
he
laughed
involuntarily
what
is
it
frere
oh
it
you
sylvia
is
it
ha
ha
ha
i
was
thinking
of
something
something
indeed
said
sylvia
i
am
glad
of
that
where
dawes
frere
was
displeased
at
the
interest
with
which
she
asked
the
question
you
are
always
thinking
of
that
fellow
it
dawes
dawes
dawes
all
day
long
he
has
oh
with
a
sorrowful
accent
mamma
wants
to
see
what
about
says
frere
roughly
mamma
is
ill
dawes
is
a
doctor
what
the
matter
with
her
she
is
worse
than
she
was
yesterday
i
do
know
what
is
the
frere
somewhat
alarmed
strode
over
to
the
little
cavern
the
lady
of
the
commandant
was
in
a
strange
plight
the
cavern
was
lofty
but
narrow
in
shape
it
was
having
two
sides
open
to
the
wind
the
ingenuity
of
rufus
dawes
had
closed
these
sides
with
and
clay
and
a
sort
of
door
of
interlaced
brushwood
hung
at
one
of
them
frere
pushed
open
this
door
and
entered
the
poor
woman
was
lying
on
a
bed
of
rushes
strewn
over
young
brushwood
and
was
moaning
feebly
from
the
first
she
had
felt
the
privation
to
which
she
was
subjected
most
keenly
and
the
mental
anxiety
from
which
she
suffered
increased
her
physical
debility
the
exhaustion
and
lassitude
to
which
she
had
partially
succumbed
soon
after
dawes
arrival
had
now
completely
overcome
her
and
she
was
unable
to
rise
cheer
up
said
maurice
with
an
assumption
of
heartiness
it
will
be
all
right
in
a
day
or
is
it
you
i
sent
for
he
is
away
just
now
i
am
making
a
boat
did
not
sylvia
tell
you
she
told
me
that
he
was
making
well
i
that
is
we
are
making
it
he
will
be
back
again
tonight
can
i
do
anything
for
you
no
thank
you
i
only
wanted
to
know
how
he
was
getting
on
i
must
go
soon
if
i
am
to
go
thank
you
frere
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
this
is
a
dreadful
place
to
have
visitors
is
it
never
mind
said
frere
again
you
will
be
back
in
hobart
town
in
a
few
days
now
we
are
sure
to
get
picked
up
by
a
ship
but
you
must
cheer
up
have
some
tea
or
no
thank
you
i
do
feel
well
enough
to
eat
i
am
sylvia
began
to
cry
do
cry
dear
i
shall
be
better
by
and
by
oh
i
wish
dawes
was
maurice
frere
went
out
indignant
this
dawes
was
everybody
it
seemed
and
he
was
nobody
let
them
wait
a
little
all
that
day
working
hard
to
carry
out
the
convict
directions
he
meditated
a
thousand
plans
by
which
he
could
turn
the
tables
he
would
accuse
dawes
of
violence
he
would
demand
that
he
should
be
taken
back
as
an
absconder
he
would
insist
that
the
law
should
take
its
course
and
that
the
death
which
was
the
doom
of
all
who
were
caught
in
the
act
of
escape
from
a
penal
settlement
should
be
enforced
yet
if
they
got
safe
to
land
the
marvellous
courage
and
ingenuity
of
the
prisoner
would
tell
strongly
in
his
favour
the
woman
and
child
would
bear
witness
to
his
tenderness
and
skill
and
plead
for
him
as
he
had
said
the
convict
deserved
a
pardon
the
mean
bad
man
burning
with
wounded
vanity
and
undefined
jealousy
waited
for
some
method
to
suggest
itself
by
which
he
might
claim
the
credit
of
the
escape
and
snatch
from
the
prisoner
who
had
dared
to
rival
him
the
last
hope
of
freedom
rufus
dawes
drifting
with
the
current
had
allowed
himself
to
coast
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
harbour
until
the
pilot
station
appeared
in
view
on
the
opposite
shore
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
seven
he
landed
at
a
sandy
cove
and
drawing
up
his
raft
proceeded
to
unpack
from
among
his
garments
a
piece
of
damper
having
eaten
sparingly
and
dried
himself
in
the
sun
he
replaced
the
remains
of
his
breakfast
and
pushed
his
floats
again
into
the
water
the
pilot
station
lay
some
distance
below
him
on
the
opposite
shore
he
had
purposely
made
his
second
start
from
a
point
which
would
give
him
this
advantage
of
position
for
had
he
attempted
to
paddle
across
at
right
angles
the
strength
of
the
current
would
have
swept
him
out
to
sea
weak
as
he
was
he
several
times
nearly
lost
his
hold
on
the
reeds
the
clumsy
bundle
presenting
too
great
a
broadside
to
the
stream
whirled
round
and
round
and
was
once
or
twice
nearly
sucked
under
at
length
however
breathless
and
exhausted
he
gained
the
opposite
bank
half
a
mile
below
the
point
he
had
attempted
to
make
and
carrying
his
floats
out
of
reach
of
the
tide
made
off
across
the
hill
to
the
pilot
station
arrived
there
about
midday
he
set
to
work
to
lay
his
snares
the
goats
with
whose
hides
he
hoped
to
cover
the
coracle
were
sufficiently
numerous
and
tame
to
encourage
him
to
use
every
exertion
he
carefully
examined
the
tracks
of
the
animals
and
found
that
they
converged
to
one
point
the
track
to
the
nearest
water
with
much
labour
he
cut
down
bushes
so
as
to
mask
the
approach
to
the
waterhole
on
all
sides
save
where
these
tracks
immediately
conjoined
close
to
the
water
and
at
unequal
distances
along
the
various
tracks
he
scattered
the
salt
he
had
obtained
by
his
rude
distillation
of
between
this
scattered
salt
and
the
points
where
he
judged
the
animals
would
be
likely
to
approach
he
set
his
traps
made
after
the
following
manner
he
took
several
pliant
branches
of
young
trees
and
having
stripped
them
of
leaves
and
twigs
dug
with
his
knife
and
the
end
of
the
rude
paddle
he
had
made
for
the
voyage
across
the
inlet
a
succession
of
holes
about
a
foot
deep
at
the
thicker
end
of
these
saplings
he
fastened
by
a
piece
of
fishing
line
a
small
which
swung
loosely
like
the
stick
handle
which
a
schoolboy
fastens
to
the
string
of
his
pegtop
forcing
the
ends
of
the
saplings
thus
prepared
into
the
holes
he
filled
in
and
stamped
down
the
earth
all
around
them
the
saplings
thus
anchored
as
it
were
by
the
of
stick
not
only
stood
firm
but
resisted
all
his
efforts
to
withdraw
them
to
the
thin
ends
of
these
saplings
he
bound
tightly
into
notches
cut
in
the
wood
and
secured
by
a
multiplicity
of
twisting
the
catgut
springes
he
had
brought
from
the
camping
ground
the
saplings
were
then
bent
double
and
the
gutted
ends
secured
in
the
ground
by
the
same
means
as
that
employed
to
fix
the
butts
this
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
business
for
it
was
necessary
to
discover
precisely
the
amount
of
pressure
that
would
hold
the
bent
rod
without
allowing
it
to
escape
by
reason
of
this
elasticity
and
which
would
yet
give
to
a
slight
pull
on
the
gut
after
many
failures
however
this
happy
medium
was
discovered
and
rufus
dawes
concealing
his
springes
by
means
of
twigs
smoothed
the
disturbed
sand
with
a
branch
and
retired
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
labours
about
two
hours
after
he
had
gone
the
goats
came
to
drink
there
were
five
goats
and
two
kids
and
they
trotted
calmly
along
the
path
to
the
water
the
watcher
soon
saw
that
his
precautions
had
been
in
a
manner
wasted
the
leading
goat
marched
gravely
into
the
springe
which
catching
him
round
his
neck
released
the
bent
rod
and
sprang
him
off
his
legs
into
the
air
he
uttered
a
comical
bleat
and
then
hung
kicking
rufus
dawes
though
the
success
of
the
scheme
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
burst
out
laughing
at
the
antics
of
the
beast
the
other
goats
bounded
off
at
this
sudden
elevation
of
their
leader
and
three
more
were
entrapped
at
a
little
distance
rufus
dawes
now
thought
it
time
to
secure
his
prize
though
three
of
the
springes
were
as
yet
unsprung
he
ran
down
to
the
old
goat
knife
in
hand
but
before
he
could
reach
him
the
catgut
gave
way
and
the
old
fellow
shaking
his
head
with
grotesque
dismay
made
off
at
full
speed
the
others
however
were
secured
and
killed
the
loss
of
the
springe
was
not
a
serious
one
for
three
traps
remained
unsprung
and
before
sundown
rufus
dawes
had
caught
four
more
goats
removing
with
care
the
catgut
that
had
done
such
good
service
he
dragged
the
carcases
to
the
shore
and
proceeded
to
pack
them
upon
his
floats
he
discovered
however
that
the
weight
was
too
great
and
that
the
water
entering
through
the
loops
of
the
stitching
in
the
hide
had
so
soaked
the
as
to
render
the
floats
no
longer
buoyant
he
was
compelled
therefore
to
spend
two
hours
in
the
skin
with
such
material
as
he
could
find
some
light
and
seaweed
which
the
action
of
the
water
had
swathed
after
the
fashion
of
haybands
along
the
shore
formed
an
excellent
substitute
for
grass
and
having
bound
his
bundle
of
rushes
lengthwise
with
the
as
a
he
succeeded
in
forming
a
sort
of
rude
canoe
upon
which
the
carcases
floated
securely
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
morning
and
the
violence
of
his
exertions
had
exhausted
him
still
sustained
by
the
excitement
of
the
task
he
had
set
himself
he
dismissed
with
fierce
impatience
the
thought
of
rest
and
dragged
his
weary
limbs
along
the
sand
endeavouring
to
kill
fatigue
by
further
exertion
the
tide
was
now
running
in
and
he
knew
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
regain
the
further
shore
while
the
current
was
in
his
favour
to
cross
from
the
pilot
station
at
low
water
was
impossible
if
he
waited
until
the
ebb
he
must
spend
another
day
on
the
shore
and
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
an
hour
cutting
a
long
sapling
he
fastened
to
one
end
of
it
the
floating
bundle
and
thus
guided
it
to
a
spot
where
the
beach
shelved
abruptly
into
deep
water
it
was
a
clear
night
and
the
risen
moon
large
and
low
flung
a
rippling
streak
of
silver
across
the
sea
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
all
was
bathed
in
a
violet
haze
which
veiled
the
inlet
from
which
he
had
started
in
the
morning
the
fire
of
the
exiles
hidden
behind
a
point
of
rock
cast
a
red
glow
into
the
air
the
ocean
breakers
rolled
in
upon
the
cliffs
outside
the
bar
with
a
hoarse
and
threatening
murmur
and
the
rising
tide
rippled
and
lapped
with
treacherous
melody
along
the
sand
he
touched
the
chill
water
and
drew
back
for
an
instant
he
determined
to
wait
until
the
beams
of
morning
should
illumine
that
beautiful
but
treacherous
sea
and
then
the
thought
of
the
helpless
child
who
was
without
doubt
waiting
and
watching
for
him
on
the
shore
gave
new
strength
to
his
wearied
frame
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
glow
that
hovering
above
the
dark
marked
her
presence
he
pushed
the
raft
before
him
out
into
the
sea
the
reeds
sustained
him
bravely
but
the
strength
of
the
current
sucked
him
underneath
the
water
and
for
several
seconds
he
feared
that
he
should
be
compelled
to
let
go
his
hold
but
his
muscles
steeled
in
the
slow
fire
of
withstood
this
last
strain
upon
them
and
with
bursting
chest
and
paralysed
fingers
he
preserved
his
position
until
the
mass
getting
out
of
the
eddies
along
the
drifted
steadily
down
the
silvery
track
that
led
to
the
settlement
after
a
few
moments
rest
he
set
his
teeth
and
urged
his
strange
canoe
towards
the
shore
paddling
and
pushing
he
gradually
edged
it
towards
the
and
at
last
just
when
his
stiffened
limbs
refused
to
obey
the
impulse
of
his
will
and
he
began
to
drift
onwards
with
the
onward
tide
he
felt
his
feet
strike
firm
ground
opening
his
eyes
closed
in
the
desperation
of
his
last
efforts
he
found
himself
safe
under
the
lee
of
the
rugged
promontory
which
hid
the
fire
it
seemed
that
the
waves
tired
of
persecuting
him
had
with
disdainful
pity
cast
him
ashore
at
the
goal
of
his
hopes
looking
back
he
for
the
first
time
realized
the
frightful
peril
he
had
escaped
and
shuddered
to
this
shudder
succeeded
a
thrill
of
triumph
why
had
he
stayed
so
long
when
escape
was
so
easy
dragging
the
carcases
above
mark
he
rounded
the
little
promontory
and
made
for
the
fire
the
recollection
of
the
night
when
he
had
first
approached
it
came
upon
him
and
increased
his
exultation
how
different
a
man
was
he
now
from
then
passing
up
the
sand
he
saw
the
stakes
which
he
had
directed
frere
to
cut
whiten
in
the
moonshine
his
officer
worked
for
him
in
his
own
brain
alone
lay
the
secret
of
escape
he
rufus
dawes
the
scarred
degraded
prisoner
could
alone
get
these
three
beings
back
to
civilization
did
he
refuse
to
aid
them
they
would
for
ever
remain
in
that
prison
where
he
had
so
long
suffered
the
tables
were
turned
he
had
become
a
gaoler
he
had
gained
the
fire
before
the
solitary
watcher
there
heard
his
footsteps
and
spread
his
hands
to
the
blaze
in
silence
he
felt
as
frere
would
have
felt
had
their
positions
been
reversed
disdainful
of
the
man
who
had
stopped
at
home
frere
starting
cried
it
is
you
have
you
succeeded
rufus
dawes
nodded
what
did
you
catch
them
there
are
four
carcases
down
by
the
rocks
you
can
have
meat
for
breakfast
the
child
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
came
running
down
from
the
hut
oh
dawes
i
am
so
glad
we
were
beginning
to
despair
mamma
and
dawes
snatched
her
from
the
ground
and
bursting
into
a
joyous
laugh
swung
her
into
the
air
tell
me
he
cried
holding
up
the
child
with
two
dripping
arms
above
him
what
you
will
do
for
me
if
i
bring
you
and
mamma
safe
home
again
give
you
a
free
pardon
says
sylvia
and
papa
shall
make
you
his
servant
frere
burst
out
laughing
at
this
reply
and
dawes
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
put
the
child
upon
the
ground
and
walked
away
this
was
in
truth
all
he
could
hope
for
all
his
scheming
all
his
courage
all
his
peril
would
but
result
in
the
patronage
of
a
great
man
like
major
vickers
his
heart
big
with
love
with
and
with
hopes
of
a
fair
future
would
have
this
flattering
unction
laid
to
it
he
had
performed
a
prodigy
of
skill
and
daring
and
for
his
reward
he
was
to
be
made
a
servant
to
the
creatures
he
had
protected
yet
what
more
could
a
convict
expect
sylvia
saw
how
deeply
her
unconscious
hand
had
driven
the
iron
and
ran
up
to
the
man
she
had
wounded
and
dawes
remember
that
i
shall
love
you
the
convict
however
his
momentary
excitement
over
motioned
her
away
and
she
saw
him
stretch
himself
wearily
under
the
shadow
of
a
rock
chapter
xv
the
coracle
in
the
morning
however
rufus
dawes
was
first
at
work
and
made
no
allusion
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
evening
he
had
already
skinned
one
of
the
goats
and
he
directed
frere
to
set
to
work
upon
another
cut
down
the
rump
to
the
hock
and
down
the
brisket
to
the
knee
he
said
i
want
the
hides
as
square
as
by
dint
of
hard
work
they
got
the
four
goats
skinned
and
the
entrails
cleaned
ready
for
twisting
by
breakfast
time
and
having
broiled
some
of
the
flesh
made
a
hearty
meal
vickers
being
no
better
dawes
went
to
see
her
and
seemed
to
have
made
friends
again
with
sylvia
for
he
came
out
of
the
hut
with
the
child
hand
in
his
frere
who
was
cutting
the
meat
in
long
strips
to
dry
in
the
sun
saw
this
and
it
added
fresh
fuel
to
the
fire
in
his
unreasonable
envy
and
jealousy
however
he
said
nothing
for
his
enemy
had
not
yet
shown
him
how
the
boat
was
to
be
made
before
midday
however
he
was
a
partner
in
the
secret
which
after
all
was
a
very
simple
one
rufus
dawes
took
two
of
the
straightest
and
most
tapered
of
the
pines
which
frere
had
cut
on
the
previous
day
and
lashed
them
tightly
together
with
the
butts
outwards
he
thus
produced
a
spliced
stick
about
twelve
feet
long
about
two
feet
from
either
end
he
notched
the
young
tree
until
he
could
bend
the
extremities
upwards
and
having
so
bent
them
he
secured
the
bent
portions
in
their
places
by
means
of
lashings
of
raw
hide
the
spliced
trees
now
presented
a
rude
outline
of
the
section
of
a
boat
having
the
stem
keel
and
stern
all
in
one
piece
this
having
been
placed
lengthwise
between
the
stakes
four
other
poles
notched
in
two
places
were
lashed
from
stake
to
stake
running
crosswise
to
the
keel
and
forming
the
knees
four
saplings
were
now
bent
from
end
to
end
of
the
upturned
portions
of
the
keel
that
represented
stem
and
stern
two
of
these
four
were
placed
above
as
gunwales
two
below
as
bottom
rails
at
each
intersection
the
sticks
were
lashed
firmly
with
fishing
line
the
whole
framework
being
complete
the
stakes
were
drawn
out
and
there
lay
upon
the
ground
the
skeleton
of
a
boat
eight
feet
long
by
three
broad
frere
whose
hands
were
blistered
and
sore
would
fain
have
rested
but
the
convict
would
not
hear
of
it
let
us
finish
he
said
regardless
of
his
own
fatigue
the
skins
will
be
dry
if
we
i
can
work
no
more
says
frere
sulkily
i
ca
stand
you
got
muscles
of
iron
i
suppose
i
they
made
me
work
when
i
could
stand
maurice
frere
it
is
wonderful
what
spirit
the
cat
gives
a
man
there
nothing
like
work
to
get
rid
of
aching
muscles
so
they
used
to
tell
well
what
to
be
done
now
cover
the
boat
there
you
can
set
the
fat
to
melt
and
sew
these
hides
together
two
and
two
do
you
see
and
then
sew
the
pair
at
the
necks
there
is
plenty
of
catgut
do
talk
to
me
as
if
i
was
a
dog
says
frere
suddenly
be
civil
ca
but
the
other
busily
trimming
and
cutting
at
the
projecting
pieces
of
sapling
made
no
reply
it
is
possible
that
he
thought
the
fatigued
lieutenant
beneath
his
notice
about
an
hour
before
sundown
the
hides
were
ready
and
rufus
dawes
having
in
the
meantime
interlaced
the
ribs
of
the
skeleton
with
wattles
stretched
the
skins
over
it
with
the
hairy
side
inwards
along
the
edges
of
this
covering
he
bored
holes
at
intervals
and
passing
through
these
holes
thongs
of
twisted
skin
he
drew
the
whole
to
the
top
rail
of
the
boat
one
last
precaution
remained
dipping
the
pannikin
into
the
melted
tallow
he
plentifully
anointed
the
seams
of
the
sewn
skins
the
boat
thus
turned
looked
like
a
huge
walnut
shell
covered
with
red
and
reeking
hide
or
the
skull
of
some
titan
who
had
been
scalped
there
cried
rufus
dawes
triumphant
twelve
hours
in
the
sun
to
tighten
the
hides
and
she
swim
like
a
the
next
day
was
spent
in
minor
preparations
the
jerked
was
packed
securely
into
as
small
a
compass
as
possible
the
rum
barrel
was
filled
with
water
and
water
bags
were
improvised
out
of
portions
of
the
intestines
of
the
goats
rufus
dawes
having
filled
these
last
with
water
ran
a
wooden
skewer
through
their
mouths
and
twisted
it
tight
tourniquet
fashion
he
also
stripped
cylindrical
pieces
of
bark
and
having
sewn
each
cylinder
at
the
side
fitted
to
it
a
bottom
of
the
same
material
and
caulked
the
seams
with
gum
and
resin
thus
four
tolerable
buckets
were
obtained
one
goatskin
yet
remained
and
out
of
that
it
was
determined
to
make
a
sail
the
currents
are
strong
said
rufus
dawes
and
we
shall
not
be
able
to
row
far
with
such
oars
as
we
have
got
if
we
get
a
breeze
it
may
save
our
it
was
impossible
to
step
a
mast
in
the
frail
basket
structure
but
this
difficulty
was
overcome
by
a
simple
contrivance
from
thwart
to
thwart
two
poles
were
bound
and
the
mast
lashed
between
these
poles
with
thongs
of
raw
hide
was
secured
by
shrouds
of
twisted
fishing
line
running
fore
and
aft
sheets
of
bark
were
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
craft
and
made
a
safe
flooring
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
on
the
fourth
day
when
these
preparations
were
completed
and
it
was
decided
that
on
the
morrow
they
should
adventure
the
journey
we
will
coast
down
to
the
bar
said
rufus
dawes
and
wait
for
the
slack
of
the
tide
i
can
do
no
more
sylvia
who
had
seated
herself
on
a
rock
at
a
little
distance
called
to
them
her
strength
was
restored
by
the
fresh
meat
and
her
childish
spirits
had
risen
with
the
hope
of
safety
the
mercurial
little
creature
had
wreathed
seaweed
about
her
head
and
holding
in
her
hand
a
long
twig
decorated
with
a
tuft
of
leaves
to
represent
a
wand
she
personified
one
of
the
heroines
of
her
books
i
am
the
queen
of
the
island
she
said
merrily
and
you
are
my
obedient
subjects
pray
sir
eglamour
is
the
boat
ready
it
is
your
majesty
said
poor
dawes
then
we
will
see
it
come
walk
in
front
of
me
i
wo
ask
you
to
rub
your
nose
upon
the
ground
like
man
friday
because
that
would
be
uncomfortable
frere
you
do
play
oh
yes
says
frere
unable
to
withstand
the
charming
pout
that
accompanied
the
words
i
play
what
am
i
to
do
you
must
walk
on
this
side
and
be
respectful
of
course
it
is
only
pretend
you
know
she
added
with
a
quick
consciousness
of
conceit
now
then
the
queen
goes
down
to
the
seashore
surrounded
by
her
nymphs
there
is
no
occasion
to

then
we

across

do

off

no

about

it
all
sheer
hard
yes
echoed
sylvia
sheer
hard
work
sheer
hard
work
by
good
dawes
and
she
began
to
sing
a
childish
chant
of
triumph
drawing
lines
and
letters
in
the
sand
the
while
with
the
sceptre
of
the
queen
good
dawes
good
dawes
this
is
the
work
of
good

maurice
could
not
resist
a
sneer
margery

sold
her

and
lay
upon
straw
said
he
good
dawes
repeated
sylvia
good
dawes
why
should
i
say
it
you
are
disagreeable
sir
i
wo
play
with
you
any
more
and
she
went
off
along
the
sand
poor
little
child
said
rufus
dawes
you
speak
too
harshly
to
frere
now
that
the
boat
was
made
had
regained
his
civilization
seemed
now
brought
sufficiently
close
to
him
to
warrant
his
assuming
the
position
of
authority
to
which
his
social
position
entitled
him
one
would
think
that
a
boat
had
never
been
built
before
to
hear
her
talk
he
said
if
this
had
been
one
of
my
old
uncle
she
could
have
said
much
more
by
the
lord
he
added
with
a
coarse
laugh
i
ought
to
have
a
natural
talent
for
for
if
the
old
villain
had
died
when
he
did
i
should
have
been
a
rufus
dawes
turned
his
back
at
the
word
died
and
busied
himself
with
the
fastenings
of
the
hides
could
the
other
have
seen
his
face
he
would
have
been
struck
by
its
sudden
pallor
ah
continued
frere
half
to
himself
and
half
to
his
companion
that
a
sum
of
money
to
lose
is
it
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
convict
without
turning
his
face
mean
why
my
good
fellow
i
should
have
been
left
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
but
the
old
hunks
who
was
going
to
give
it
to
me
died
before
he
could
alter
his
will
and
every
shilling
went
to
a
scapegrace
son
who
had
been
near
the
old
man
for
years
that
the
way
of
the
world
is
it
rufus
dawes
still
keeping
his
face
away
caught
his
breath
as
if
in
astonishment
and
then
recovering
himself
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
a
fortunate
fellow
that
son
fortunate
cries
frere
with
another
oath
oh
yes
he
was
fortunate
he
was
burnt
to
death
in
the
hydaspes
and
never
heard
of
his
luck
his
mother
has
got
the
money
though
i
never
saw
a
shilling
of
and
then
seemingly
displeased
with
himself
for
having
allowed
his
tongue
to
get
the
better
of
his
dignity
he
walked
away
to
the
fire
musing
doubtless
on
the
difference
between
maurice
frere
with
a
quarter
of
a
million
disporting
himself
in
the
best
society
that
could
be
procured
with
command
of
and
gamecocks
galore
and
maurice
frere
a
penniless
lieutenant
marooned
on
the
barren
coast
of
macquarie
harbour
and
acting
as
to
a
runaway
convict
rufus
dawes
was
also
lost
in
reverie
he
leant
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
sea
weltering
golden
in
the
sunset
but
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
nothing
of
the
scene
before
him
struck
dumb
by
the
sudden
intelligence
of
his
fortune
his
imagination
escaped
from
his
control
and
fled
away
to
those
scenes
which
he
had
striven
so
vainly
to
forget
he
was
looking
far
away
across
the
glittering
harbour
and
the
wide
sea
beyond
it
looking
at
the
old
house
at
hampstead
with
its
gloomy
garden
he
pictured
himself
escaped
from
this
present
peril
and
freed
from
the
sordid
thraldom
which
so
long
had
held
him
he
saw
himself
returning
with
some
plausible
story
of
his
wanderings
to
take
possession
of
the
wealth
which
was
his
saw
himself
living
once
more
rich
free
and
respected
in
the
world
from
which
he
had
been
so
long
an
exile
he
saw
his
mother
sweet
pale
face
the
light
of
a
happy
home
circle
he
saw
himself
received
with
tears
of
joy
and
marvelling
affection
entering
into
this
home
circle
as
one
risen
from
the
dead
a
new
life
opened
radiant
before
him
and
he
was
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
his
own
happiness
so
absorbed
was
he
that
he
did
not
hear
the
light
footstep
of
the
child
across
the
sand
vickers
having
been
told
of
the
success
which
had
crowned
the
convict
efforts
had
overcome
her
weakness
so
far
as
to
hobble
down
the
beach
to
the
boat
and
now
heralded
by
sylvia
approached
leaning
on
the
arm
of
maurice
frere
mamma
has
come
to
see
the
boat
dawes
cries
sylvia
but
dawes
did
not
hear
the
child
reiterated
her
words
but
still
the
silent
figure
did
not
reply
mr
dawes
she
cried
again
and
pulled
him
by
the
the
touch
aroused
him
and
looking
down
he
saw
the
pretty
thin
face
upturned
to
his
scarcely
conscious
of
what
he
did
and
still
following
out
the
imagining
which
made
him
free
wealthy
and
respected
he
caught
the
little
creature
in
his
arms
as
he
might
have
caught
his
own
daughter
and
kissed
her
sylvia
said
nothing
but
frere
arrived
by
his
chain
of
reasoning
at
quite
another
conclusion
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
was
astonished
at
the
presumption
of
the
man
the
lieutenant
regarded
himself
as
already
reinstated
in
his
old
position
and
with
vickers
on
his
arm
reproved
the
apparent
insolence
of
the
convict
as
freely
as
he
would
have
done
had
they
both
been
at
his
own
little
kingdom
of
maria
island
you
insolent
beggar
he
cried
do
you
dare
keep
your
place
sir
the
sentence
recalled
rufus
dawes
to
reality
his
place
was
that
of
a
convict
what
business
had
he
with
tenderness
for
the
daughter
of
his
master
yet
after
all
he
had
done
and
proposed
to
do
this
harsh
judgment
upon
him
seemed
cruel
he
saw
the
two
looking
at
the
boat
he
had
built
he
marked
the
flush
of
hope
on
the
cheek
of
the
poor
lady
and
the
authority
that
already
hardened
the
eye
of
maurice
frere
and
all
at
once
he
understood
the
result
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
by
his
own
act
given
himself
again
to
bondage
as
long
as
escape
was
impracticable
he
had
been
useful
and
even
powerful
now
he
had
pointed
out
the
way
of
escape
he
had
sunk
into
the
beast
of
burden
once
again
in
the
desert
he
was
dawes
the
saviour
in
civilized
life
he
would
become
once
more
rufus
dawes
the
ruffian
the
prisoner
the
absconder
he
stood
mute
and
let
frere
point
out
the
excellences
of
the
craft
in
silence
and
then
feeling
that
the
few
words
of
thanks
uttered
by
the
lady
were
chilled
by
her
consciousness
of
the
freedom
he
had
taken
with
the
child
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
up
into
the
bush
a
queer
fellow
said
frere
as
vickers
followed
the
retreating
figure
with
her
eyes
always
in
an
ill
poor
man
he
has
behaved
very
kindly
to
us
said
vickers
yet
even
she
felt
the
change
of
circumstance
and
knew
that
without
any
reason
she
could
name
her
blind
trust
and
hope
in
the
convict
who
had
saved
their
lives
had
been
transformed
into
a
patronizing
kindliness
which
was
quite
foreign
to
esteem
or
affection
come
let
us
have
some
supper
says
frere
the
last
we
shall
eat
here
i
hope
he
will
come
back
when
his
fit
of
sulks
is
but
he
did
not
come
back
and
after
a
few
expressions
of
wonder
at
his
absence
vickers
and
her
daughter
rapt
in
the
hopes
and
fears
of
the
morrow
almost
forgot
that
he
had
left
them
with
marvellous
credulity
they
looked
upon
the
terrible
stake
they
were
about
to
play
for
as
already
won
the
possession
of
the
boat
seemed
to
them
so
wonderful
that
the
perils
of
the
voyage
they
were
to
make
in
it
were
altogether
lost
sight
of
as
for
maurice
frere
he
was
rejoiced
that
the
convict
was
out
of
the
way
he
wished
that
he
was
out
of
the
way
altogether
chapter
xvi
the
writing
on
the
sand
having
got
out
of
of
the
ungrateful
creatures
he
had
befriended
rufus
dawes
threw
himself
upon
the
ground
in
an
agony
of
mingled
rage
and
regret
for
the
first
time
for
six
years
he
had
tasted
the
happiness
of
doing
good
the
delight
of
for
the
first
time
for
six
years
he
had
broken
through
the
selfish
misanthropy
he
had
taught
himself
and
this
was
his
reward
he
had
held
his
temper
in
check
in
order
that
it
might
not
offend
others
he
had
banished
the
galling
memory
of
his
degradation
lest
haply
some
shadow
of
it
might
seem
to
fall
upon
the
fair
child
whose
lot
had
been
so
strangely
cast
with
his
he
had
stifled
the
agony
he
suffered
lest
its
expression
should
give
pain
to
those
who
seemed
to
feel
for
him
he
had
forborne
retaliation
when
retaliation
would
have
been
most
sweet
having
all
these
years
waited
and
watched
for
a
chance
to
strike
his
persecutors
he
had
held
his
hand
now
that
an
accident
had
placed
the
weapon
of
destruction
in
his
grasp
he
had
risked
his
life
forgone
his
enmities
almost
changed
his
nature
and
his
reward
was
cold
looks
and
harsh
words
so
soon
as
his
skill
had
paved
the
way
to
freedom
this
knowledge
coming
upon
him
while
the
thrill
of
exultation
at
the
astounding
news
of
his
riches
yet
vibrated
in
his
brain
made
him
grind
his
teeth
with
rage
at
his
own
hard
fate
bound
by
the
purest
and
holiest
of
ties
the
affection
of
a
son
to
his
mother
he
had
condemned
himself
to
social
death
rather
than
buy
his
liberty
and
life
by
a
revelation
which
would
shame
the
gentle
creature
whom
he
loved
by
a
strange
series
of
accidents
fortune
had
assisted
him
to
maintain
the
deception
he
had
practised
his
cousin
had
not
recognized
him
the
very
ship
in
which
he
was
believed
to
have
sailed
had
been
lost
with
every
soul
on
board
his
identity
had
been
completely
destroyed
no
link
remained
which
could
connect
rufus
dawes
the
convict
with
richard
devine
the
vanished
heir
to
the
wealth
of
the
dead
oh
if
he
had
only
known
if
while
in
the
gloomy
prison
distracted
by
a
thousand
fears
and
weighed
down
by
crushing
evidence
of
circumstance
he
had
but
guessed
that
death
had
stepped
between
sir
richard
and
his
vengeance
he
might
have
spared
himself
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
he
had
been
tried
and
condemned
as
a
nameless
sailor
who
could
call
no
witnesses
in
his
defence
and
give
no
particulars
as
to
his
previous
history
it
was
clear
to
him
now
that
he
might
have
adhered
to
his
statement
of
ignorance
concerning
the
murder
locked
in
his
breast
the
name
of
the
murderer
and
have
yet
been
free
judges
are
just
but
popular
opinion
is
powerful
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
richard
devine
the
millionaire
would
have
escaped
the
fate
which
had
overtaken
rufus
dawes
the
sailor
into
his
calculations
in
the
prison
when
with
love
with
terror
and
despair
he
had
counted
up
his
chances
of
life
the
wild
supposition
that
he
had
even
then
inherited
the
wealth
of
the
father
who
had
disowned
him
had
never
entered
the
knowledge
of
that
fact
would
have
altered
the
whole
current
of
his
life
and
he
learnt
it
for
the
first
time
now
too
late
now
lying
prone
upon
the
sand
now
wandering
aimlessly
up
and
down
among
the
stunted
trees
that
bristled
white
beneath
the
moon
now
sitting
as
he
had
sat
in
the
prison
long
ago
with
the
head
gripped
hard
between
his
hands
swaying
his
body
to
and
fro
he
thought
out
the
frightful
problem
of
his
bitter
life
of
little
use
was
the
heritage
that
he
had
gained
a
whose
hands
were
hard
with
menial
service
and
whose
back
was
scarred
with
the
lash
could
never
be
received
among
the
gently
nurtured
let
him
lay
claim
to
his
name
and
rights
what
then
he
was
a
convicted
felon
and
his
name
and
rights
had
been
taken
from
him
by
the
law
let
him
go
and
tell
maurice
frere
that
he
was
his
lost
cousin
he
would
be
laughed
at
let
him
proclaim
aloud
his
birth
and
innocence
and
the
would
grin
and
the
convict
overseer
set
him
to
harder
labour
let
him
even
by
dint
of
reiteration
get
his
wild
story
believed
what
would
happen
if
it
was
heard
in
england
after
the
lapse
of
years
perhaps
that
a
convict
in
the
in
macquarie
harbour
a
man
held
to
be
a
murderer
and
whose
convict
career
was
one
long
record
of
mutiny
and
punishment
claimed
to
be
the
heir
to
an
english
fortune
and
to
own
the
right
to
dispossess
staid
and
worthy
english
folk
of
their
rank
and
station
with
what
feeling
would
the
announcement
be
received
certainly
not
with
a
desire
to
redeem
this
ruffian
from
his
bonds
and
place
him
in
the
honoured
seat
of
his
dead
father
such
intelligence
would
be
regarded
as
a
calamity
an
unhappy
blot
upon
a
fair
reputation
a
disgrace
to
an
honoured
and
unsullied
name
let
him
succeed
let
him
return
again
to
the
mother
who
had
by
this
time
become
reconciled
in
a
measure
to
his
loss
he
would
at
the
best
be
to
her
a
living
shame
scarcely
less
degrading
than
that
which
she
had
dreaded
but
success
was
almost
impossible
he
did
not
dare
to
retrace
his
steps
through
the
hideous
labyrinth
into
which
he
had
plunged
was
he
to
show
his
scarred
shoulders
as
a
proof
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
an
innocent
man
was
he
to
relate
the
nameless
infamies
of
macquarie
harbour
as
a
proof
that
he
was
entitled
to
receive
the
hospitalities
of
the
generous
and
to
sit
a
respected
guest
at
the
tables
of
men
of
refinement
was
he
to
quote
the
horrible
slang
of
the
and
retail
the
filthy
jests
of
the
and
the
hulks
as
a
proof
that
he
was
a
fit
companion
for
women
and
innocent
children
suppose
even
that
he
could
conceal
the
name
of
the
real
criminal
and
show
himself
guiltless
of
the
crime
for
which
he
had
been
condemned
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
could
not
buy
back
that
blissful
ignorance
of
evil
which
had
once
been
his
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
could
not
purchase
the
which
had
been
cut
out
of
him
by
the
lash
or
banish
from
his
brain
the
memory
of
his
degradation
for
hours
this
agony
of
thought
racked
him
he
cried
out
as
though
with
physical
pain
and
then
lay
in
a
stupor
exhausted
with
actual
physical
suffering
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
freedom
and
of
honour
let
him
keep
silence
and
pursue
the
life
fate
had
marked
out
for
him
he
would
return
to
bondage
the
law
would
claim
him
as
an
absconder
and
would
mete
out
to
him
such
punishment
as
was
fitting
perhaps
he
might
escape
severest
punishment
as
a
reward
for
his
exertions
in
saving
the
child
he
might
consider
himself
fortunate
if
such
was
permitted
to
him
fortunate
suppose
he
did
not
go
back
at
all
but
wandered
away
into
the
wilderness
and
died
better
death
than
such
a
doom
as
his
yet
need
he
die
he
had
caught
goats
he
could
catch
fish
he
could
build
a
hut
in
here
was
perchance
at
the
deserted
settlement
some
remnant
of
seed
corn
that
planted
would
give
him
bread
he
had
built
a
boat
he
had
made
an
oven
he
had
fenced
in
a
hut
surely
he
could
contrive
to
live
alone
savage
and
free
alone
he
had
contrived
all
these
marvels
alone
was
not
the
boat
he
himself
had
built
below
upon
the
shore
why
not
escape
in
her
and
leave
to
their
fate
the
miserable
creatures
who
had
treated
him
with
such
ingratitude
the
idea
flashed
into
his
brain
as
though
someone
had
spoken
the
words
into
his
ear
twenty
strides
would
place
him
in
possession
of
the
boat
and
half
an
hour
drifting
with
the
current
would
take
him
beyond
pursuit
once
outside
the
bar
he
would
make
for
the
westward
in
the
hopes
of
falling
in
with
some
whaler
he
would
doubtless
meet
with
one
before
many
days
and
he
was
well
supplied
with
provision
and
water
in
the
meantime
a
tale
of
shipwreck
would
satisfy
the
sailors
and
he
paused
he
had
forgotten
that
the
rags
which
he
wore
would
betray
him
with
an
exclamation
of
despair
he
started
from
the
posture
in
which
he
was
lying
he
thrust
out
his
hands
to
raise
himself
and
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
something
soft
he
had
been
lying
at
the
foot
of
some
loose
stones
that
were
piled
cairnwise
beside
a
bush
and
the
object
that
he
had
touched
was
protruding
from
beneath
these
stones
he
caught
it
and
dragged
it
forth
it
was
the
shirt
of
poor
bates
with
trembling
hands
he
tore
away
the
stones
and
pulled
forth
the
rest
of
the
garments
they
seemed
as
though
they
had
been
left
purposely
for
him
heaven
had
sent
him
the
very
disguise
he
needed
the
night
had
passed
during
his
reverie
and
the
first
faint
streaks
of
dawn
began
to
lighten
in
the
sky
haggard
and
pale
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
scarcely
daring
to
think
about
what
he
proposed
to
do
ran
towards
the
boat
as
he
ran
however
the
voice
that
he
had
heard
encouraged
him
your
life
is
of
more
importance
than
theirs
they
will
die
but
they
have
been
ungrateful
and
deserve
death
you
will
escape
out
of
this
hell
and
return
to
the
loving
heart
who
mourns
you
you
can
do
more
good
to
mankind
than
by
saving
the
lives
of
these
people
who
despise
you
moreover
they
may
not
die
they
are
sure
to
be
sent
for
think
of
what
awaits
you
when
you
return
an
absconded
convict
he
was
within
three
feet
of
the
boat
when
he
suddenly
checked
himself
and
stood
motionless
staring
at
the
sand
with
as
much
horror
as
though
he
saw
there
the
writing
which
foretold
the
doom
of
belshazzar
he
had
come
upon
the
sentence
traced
by
sylvia
the
evening
before
and
glittering
in
the
low
light
of
the
red
sun
suddenly
risen
from
out
the
sea
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
letters
had
shaped
themselves
at
his
very
feet
good
dawes
good
dawes
what
a
frightful
reproach
there
was
to
him
in
that
simple
sentence
what
a
world
of
cowardice
baseness
and
cruelty
had
not
those
eleven
letters
opened
to
him
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
child
who
had
nursed
him
calling
on
him
to
save
her
he
saw
her
at
that
instant
standing
between
him
and
the
boat
as
she
had
stood
when
she
held
out
to
him
the
loaf
on
the
night
of
his
return
to
the
settlement
he
staggered
to
the
cavern
and
seizing
the
sleeping
frere
by
the
arm
shook
him
violently
awake
awake
he
cried
and
let
us
leave
this
place
frere
starting
to
his
feet
looked
at
the
white
face
and
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
wretched
man
before
him
with
blunt
astonishment
what
the
matter
with
you
man
he
said
you
look
as
if
you
seen
a
ghost
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
rufus
dawes
gave
a
long
sigh
and
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
come
sylvia
shouted
frere
it
time
to
get
up
i
am
ready
to
go
the
sacrifice
was
complete
the
convict
turned
away
and
two
great
glistening
tears
rolled
down
his
rugged
face
and
fell
upon
the
sand
chapter
xvii
at
sea
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
frail
boat
which
was
the
last
hope
of
these
four
human
beings
drifted
with
the
outgoing
current
towards
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
when
first
launched
she
had
come
nigh
swamping
being
overloaded
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
leave
behind
a
great
portion
of
the
dried
meat
with
what
pangs
this
was
done
can
be
easily
imagined
for
each
atom
of
food
seemed
to
represent
an
hour
of
life
yet
there
was
no
help
for
it
as
frere
said
it
was
neck
or
nothing
with
them
they
must
get
away
at
all
hazards
that
evening
they
camped
at
the
mouth
of
the
gates
dawes
being
afraid
to
risk
a
passage
until
the
slack
of
the
tide
and
about
ten
at
night
adventured
to
cross
the
bar
the
night
was
lovely
and
the
sea
calm
it
seemed
as
though
providence
had
taken
pity
on
them
for
notwithstanding
the
insecurity
of
the
craft
and
the
violence
of
the
breakers
the
dreaded
passage
was
made
with
safety
once
indeed
when
they
had
just
entered
the
surf
a
mighty
wave
curling
high
above
them
seemed
about
to
overwhelm
the
frail
structure
of
skins
and
wickerwork
but
rufus
dawes
keeping
the
nose
of
the
boat
to
the
sea
and
frere
baling
with
his
hat
they
succeeded
in
reaching
deep
water
a
great
misfortune
however
occurred
two
of
the
bark
buckets
left
by
some
unpardonable
oversight
uncleated
were
washed
overboard
and
with
them
nearly
a
fifth
of
their
scanty
store
of
water
in
the
face
of
the
greater
peril
the
accident
seemed
trifling
and
as
drenched
and
chilled
they
gained
the
open
sea
they
could
not
but
admit
that
fortune
had
almost
miraculously
befriended
them
they
made
tedious
way
with
their
rude
oars
a
light
breeze
from
the
sprang
up
with
the
dawn
and
hoisting
the
sail
they
crept
along
the
coast
it
was
resolved
that
the
two
men
should
keep
watch
and
watch
and
frere
for
the
second
time
enforced
his
authority
by
giving
the
first
watch
to
rufus
dawes
i
am
tired
he
said
and
shall
sleep
for
a
little
rufus
dawes
who
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
and
who
had
done
all
the
harder
work
said
nothing
he
had
suffered
so
much
during
the
last
two
days
that
his
senses
were
dulled
to
pain
frere
slept
until
late
in
the
afternoon
and
when
he
woke
found
the
boat
still
tossing
on
the
sea
and
sylvia
and
her
mother
both
seasick
this
seemed
strange
to
him
appeared
to
be
a
malady
which
belonged
exclusively
to
civilization
moodily
watching
the
great
green
waves
which
curled
incessantly
between
him
and
the
horizon
he
marvelled
to
think
how
curiously
events
had
come
about
a
leaf
had
as
it
were
been
torn
out
of
his
autobiography
it
seemed
a
lifetime
since
he
had
done
anything
but
moodily
scan
the
sea
or
shore
yet
on
the
morning
of
leaving
the
settlement
he
had
counted
the
notches
on
a
he
carried
and
had
been
astonished
to
find
them
but
in
number
taking
out
his
knife
he
cut
two
nicks
in
the
wicker
gunwale
of
the
coracle
that
brought
him
to
days
the
mutiny
had
taken
place
on
the
of
january
it
was
now
the
of
february
surely
thought
he
the
ladybird
might
have
returned
by
this
there
was
no
one
to
tell
him
that
the
ladybird
had
been
driven
into
port
davey
by
stress
of
weather
and
detained
there
for
seventeen
days
that
night
the
wind
fell
and
they
had
to
take
to
their
oars
rowing
all
night
they
made
but
little
progress
and
rufus
dawes
suggested
that
they
should
put
in
to
the
shore
and
wait
until
the
breeze
sprang
up
but
upon
getting
under
the
lee
of
a
long
line
of
basaltic
rocks
which
rose
abruptly
out
of
the
sea
they
found
the
waves
breaking
furiously
upon
a
horseshoe
reef
six
or
seven
miles
in
length
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
coast
again
they
coasted
for
two
days
without
a
sign
of
a
sail
and
on
the
third
day
a
great
wind
broke
upon
them
from
the
and
drove
them
back
thirty
miles
the
coracle
began
to
leak
and
required
constant
bailing
what
was
almost
as
bad
the
rum
cask
that
held
the
best
part
of
their
water
had
leaked
also
and
was
now
half
empty
they
caulked
it
by
cutting
out
the
leak
and
then
plugging
the
hole
with
linen
it
lucky
we
ai
in
the
tropics
said
frere
poor
vickers
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
wrapped
in
her
wet
shawl
and
chilled
to
the
bone
with
the
bitter
wind
had
not
the
heart
to
speak
surely
the
stifling
calm
of
the
tropics
could
not
be
worse
than
this
bleak
and
barren
sea
the
position
of
the
four
poor
creatures
was
now
almost
desperate
vickers
indeed
seemed
completely
prostrated
and
it
was
evident
that
unless
some
help
came
she
could
not
long
survive
the
continued
exposure
to
the
weather
the
child
was
in
somewhat
better
case
rufus
dawes
had
wrapped
her
in
his
woollen
shirt
and
unknown
to
frere
had
divided
with
her
daily
his
allowance
of
meat
she
lay
in
his
arms
at
night
and
in
the
day
crept
by
his
side
for
shelter
and
protection
as
long
as
she
was
near
him
she
felt
safe
they
spoke
little
to
each
other
but
when
rufus
dawes
felt
the
pressure
of
her
tiny
hand
in
his
or
sustained
the
weight
of
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
he
almost
forgot
the
cold
that
froze
him
and
the
hunger
that
gnawed
him
so
two
more
days
passed
and
yet
no
sail
on
the
tenth
day
after
their
departure
from
macquarie
harbour
they
came
to
the
end
of
their
provisions
the
salt
water
had
spoiled
the
and
soaked
the
bread
into
a
nauseous
paste
the
sea
was
still
running
high
and
the
wind
having
veered
to
the
north
was
blowing
with
increased
violence
the
long
low
line
of
coast
that
stretched
upon
their
left
hand
was
at
times
obscured
by
a
blue
mist
the
water
was
the
colour
of
mud
and
the
sky
threatened
rain
the
wretched
craft
to
which
they
had
entrusted
themselves
was
leaking
in
four
places
if
caught
in
one
of
the
frequent
storms
which
ravaged
that
coast
she
could
not
live
an
hour
the
two
men
wearied
hungry
and
cold
almost
hoped
for
the
end
to
come
quickly
to
add
to
their
distress
the
child
was
seized
with
fever
she
was
hot
and
cold
by
turns
and
in
the
intervals
of
moaning
talked
deliriously
rufus
dawes
holding
her
in
his
arms
watched
the
suffering
he
was
unable
to
alleviate
with
a
savage
despair
at
his
heart
was
she
to
die
after
all
so
another
day
and
night
passed
and
the
eleventh
morning
saw
the
boat
yet
alive
rolling
in
the
trough
of
the
same
deserted
sea
the
four
exiles
lay
in
her
almost
without
breath
all
at
once
dawes
uttered
a
cry
and
seizing
the
sheet
put
the
clumsy
craft
about
a
sail
a
sail
he
cried
do
you
not
see
her
frere
hungry
eyes
ranged
the
dull
water
in
vain
there
is
no
sail
fool
he
said
you
mock
us
the
boat
no
longer
following
the
line
of
the
coast
was
running
nearly
due
south
straight
into
the
great
southern
ocean
frere
tried
to
wrest
the
thong
from
the
hand
of
the
convict
and
bring
the
boat
back
to
her
course
are
you
mad
he
asked
in
fretful
terror
to
run
us
out
to
sea
sit
down
returned
the
other
with
a
menacing
gesture
and
staring
across
the
grey
water
i
tell
you
i
see
a
sail
frere
overawed
by
the
strange
light
which
gleamed
in
the
eyes
of
his
companion
shifted
sulkily
back
to
his
place
have
your
own
way
he
said
madman
it
serves
me
right
for
putting
off
to
sea
in
such
a
devil
craft
as
this
after
all
what
did
it
matter
as
well
be
drowned
in
as
in
sight
of
land
the
long
day
wore
out
and
no
sail
appeared
the
wind
freshened
towards
evening
and
the
boat
plunging
clumsily
on
the
long
brown
waves
staggered
as
though
drunk
with
the
water
she
had
swallowed
for
at
one
place
near
the
bows
the
water
ran
in
and
out
as
through
a
slit
in
a
wine
skin
the
coast
had
altogether
disappeared
and
the
huge
ocean
vast
stormy
and
threatening
heaved
and
hissed
all
around
them
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
should
live
until
morning
but
rufus
dawes
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
some
object
visible
alone
to
him
hugged
the
child
in
his
arms
and
drove
the
quivering
coracle
into
the
black
waste
of
night
and
sea
to
frere
sitting
sullenly
in
the
bows
the
aspect
of
this
grim
immovable
figure
with
its
hair
and
staring
eyes
had
in
it
something
supernatural
and
horrible
he
began
to
think
that
privation
and
anxiety
had
driven
the
unhappy
convict
mad
thinking
and
shuddering
over
his
fate
he
fell
as
it
seemed
to
him
into
a
momentary
sleep
in
the
midst
of
which
someone
called
to
him
he
started
up
with
shaking
knees
and
bristling
hair
the
day
had
broken
and
the
dawn
in
one
long
pale
streak
of
sickly
saffron
lay
low
on
the
left
hand
between
this
streak
of
light
and
the
bows
of
the
boat
gleamed
for
an
instant
a
white
speck
a
sail
a
sail
cried
rufus
dawes
a
wild
light
gleaming
in
his
eyes
and
a
strange
tone
vibrating
in
his
voice
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
saw
a
sail
frere
utterly
confounded
looked
again
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
and
again
did
the
white
speck
glimmer
for
an
instant
he
felt
almost
safe
and
then
a
blanker
despair
than
before
fell
upon
him
from
the
distance
at
which
she
was
it
was
impossible
for
the
ship
to
sight
the
boat
they
will
never
see
us
he
cried
dawes
dawes
do
you
hear
they
will
never
see
us
rufus
dawes
started
as
if
from
a
trance
lashing
the
sheet
to
the
pole
which
served
as
a
gunwale
he
laid
the
sleeping
child
by
her
mother
and
tearing
up
the
strip
of
bark
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
moved
to
the
bows
of
the
boat
they
will
see
this
tear
up
that
board
so
now
place
it
thus
across
the
bows
hack
off
that
sapling
end
now
that
dry
twist
of
osier
never
mind
the
boat
man
we
can
afford
to
leave
her
now
tear
off
that
outer
strip
of
hide
see
the
wood
beneath
is
dry
quick
you
are
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
cried
frere
aghast
as
the
convict
tore
up
all
the
dry
wood
he
could
find
and
heaped
it
on
the
sheet
of
bark
placed
on
the
bows
to
make
a
fire
see
frere
began
to
comprehend
i
have
three
matches
left
he
said
fumbling
with
trembling
fingers
in
his
pocket
i
wrapped
them
in
one
of
the
leaves
of
the
book
to
keep
them
the
word
book
was
a
new
inspiration
rufus
dawes
seized
upon
the
english
history
which
had
already
done
such
service
tore
out
the
drier
leaves
in
the
middle
of
the
volume
and
carefully
added
them
to
the
little
heap
of
touchwood
now
steady
the
match
was
struck
and
lighted
the
paper
after
a
few
obstinate
curlings
caught
fire
and
frere
blowing
the
young
flame
with
his
breath
the
bark
began
to
burn
he
piled
upon
the
fire
all
that
was
combustible
the
hides
began
to
shrivel
and
a
great
column
of
black
smoke
rose
up
over
the
sea
sylvia
cried
rufus
dawes
sylvia
my
darling
you
are
saved
she
opened
her
blue
eyes
and
looked
at
him
but
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
delirium
had
hold
of
her
and
in
the
hour
of
safety
the
child

forgotten
her
preserver
rufus
dawes
overcome
by
this
last
cruel
stroke
of
fortune
sat
down
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
with
the
child
in
his
arms
speechless
frere
feeding
the
fire
thought
that
the
chance
he
had
so
longed
for
had
come
with
the
mother
at
the
point
of
death
and
the
child
delirious
who
could
testify
to
this
hated
convict
skilfulness
no
one
but
maurice
frere
and
maurice
frere
as
commandant
of
convicts
could
not
but
give
up
an
absconder
to
justice
the
ship
changed
her
course
and
came
towards
this
strange
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
the
boat
the
fore
part
of
her
blazing
like
a
pine
torch
could
not
float
above
an
hour
the
little
group
of
the
convict
and
the
child
remained
motionless
vickers
was
lying
senseless
ignorant
even
of
the
approaching
succour
the
ship
a
brig
with
american
colours
flying
came
within
hail
of
them
frere
could
almost
distinguish
figures
on
her
deck
he
made
his
way
aft
to
where
dawes
was
sitting
unconscious
with
the
child
in
his
arms
and
stirred
him
roughly
with
his
foot
go
forward
he
said
in
tones
of
command
and
give
the
child
to
rufus
dawes
raised
his
head
and
seeing
the
approaching
vessel
awoke
to
the
consciousness
of
his
duty
with
a
low
laugh
full
of
unutterable
bitterness
he
placed
the
burden
he
had
borne
so
tenderly
in
the
arms
of
the
lieutenant
and
moved
to
the
blazing
bows
the
brig
was
close
upon
them
her
canvas
loomed
large
and
dusky
shadowing
the
sea
her
wet
decks
shone
in
the
morning
sunlight
from
her
bulwarks
peered
bearded
and
eager
faces
looking
with
astonishment
at
this
burning
boat
and
its
haggard
company
alone
on
that
barren
and
stormy
ocean
frere
with
sylvia
in
his
arms
waited
for
her
end
of
book
the
second
book
port
arthur
chapter
i
a
labourer
in
the
vineyard
society
in
hobart
town
in
this
year
of
grace
is
my
dear
lord
composed
of
very
curious
so
ran
a
passage
in
the
sparkling
letter
which
the
rev
meekin
chaplain
and
resident
in
van
diemen
land
was
carrying
to
the
post
office
for
the
delectation
of
his
patron
in
england
as
the
reverend
gentleman
tripped
daintily
down
the
summer
street
that
lay
between
the
blue
river
and
the
purple
mountain
he
cast
his
mild
eyes
hither
and
thither
upon
human
nature
and
the
sentence
he
had
just
penned
recurred
to
him
with
pleasurable
appositeness
elbowed
by
officers
of
garrison
bowing
sweetly
to
ladies
shrinking
from
men
or
hastening
across
a
street
to
avoid
being
run
down
by
the
that
driven
by
little
gangs
of
convicts
rattled
and
jangled
at
him
unexpectedly
from
behind
corners
he
certainly
felt
that
the
society
through
which
he
moved
was
composed
of
curious
elements
now
passed
with
haughty
nose
in
the
air
a
government
official
relaxing
for
an
instant
his
rigidity
of
demeanour
to
smile
languidly
at
the
chaplain
whom
governor
sir
john
franklin
delighted
to
honour
now
swaggered
with
coarse
defiance
of
gentility
and
patronage
a
wealthy
grown
fat
on
the
profits
of
rum
the
population
that
was
abroad
on
that
sunny
december
afternoon
had
certainly
an
incongruous
appearance
to
a
dapper
clergyman
lately
arrived
from
london
and
missing
for
the
first
time
in
his
sleek
life
those
social
screens
which
in
london
civilization
decorously
conceal
the
frailties
and
vices
of
human
nature
clad
in
glossy
black
of
the
most
fashionable
clerical
cut
with
dandy
boots
and
gloves
of
lightest
lavender
a
white
silk
overcoat
hinting
that
its
wearer
was
not
wholly
free
from
sensitiveness
to
sun
and
heat
the
reverend
meekin
tripped
daintily
to
the
post
office
and
deposited
his
letter
two
ladies
met
him
as
he
turned
mr
meekin
meekin
elegant
hat
was
raised
from
his
intellectual
brow
and
hovered
in
the
air
like
some
courteous
black
bird
for
an
instant
mrs
jellicoe
protherick
my
dear
leddies
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
and
where
pray
are
you
going
on
this
lovely
afternoon
to
stay
in
the
house
is
positively
sinful
ah
what
a
climate
but
the
trail
of
the
serpent
my
dear
protherick
the
trail
of
the
serpent
and
he
sighed
it
must
be
a
great
trial
to
you
to
come
to
the
colony
said
jellicoe
sympathizing
with
the
sigh
meekin
smiled
as
a
gentlemanly
martyr
might
have
smiled
the
work
dear
leddies
the
lord
work
i
am
but
a
poor
labourer
in
the
vineyard
toiling
through
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
the
aspect
of
him
with
his
faultless
tie
his
airy
coat
his
natty
boots
and
his
christian
smile
was
so
unlike
a
poor
labourer
toiling
through
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
that
good
jellicoe
the
wife
of
an
orthodox
comptroller
of
convicts
stores
felt
a
horrible
thrill
of
momentary
heresy
i
would
rather
have
remained
in
england
continued
meekin
smoothing
one
lavender
finger
with
the
tip
of
another
and
arching
his
elegant
eyebrows
in
mild
deprecation
of
any
praise
of
his
but
i
felt
it
my
duty
not
to
refuse
the
offer
made
me
through
the
kindness
of
his
lordship
here
is
a
field
leddies
a
field
for
the
christian
pastor
they
appeal
to
me
leddies
these
lambs
of
our
church
these
lost
and
outcast
lambs
of
our
jellicoe
shook
her
gay
bonnet
ribbons
at
meekin
with
a
hearty
smile
you
do
know
our
convicts
she
said
from
the
tone
of
her
jolly
voice
it
might
have
been
our
cattle
they
are
horrible
creatures
and
as
for
servants
my
goodness
i
have
a
fresh
one
every
week
when
you
have
been
here
a
little
longer
you
will
know
them
better
they
are
quite
unbearable
at
said
protherick
the
widow
of
a
superintendent
of
convicts
barracks
with
a
stately
indignation
mantling
in
her
sallow
cheeks
i
am
ordinarily
the
most
patient
creature
breathing
but
i
do
confess
that
the
stupid
vicious
wretches
that
one
gets
are
enough
to
put
a
saint
out
of
we
have
all
our
crosses
dear
leddies
all
our
crosses
said
the
rev
meekin
piously
heaven
send
us
strength
to
bear
them
why
you
are
going
our
way
said
jellicoe
we
can
walk
delighted
i
am
going
to
call
on
major
and
i
live
within
a
stone
throw
returned
protherick
what
a
charming
little
creature
she
is
is
she
who
asked
meekin
as
they
walked
sylvia
you
do
know
her
oh
a
dear
little
i
have
only
met
major
vickers
at
government
house
said
meekin
i
have
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
a
sad
thing
said
jellicoe
quite
a
romance
if
it
was
not
so
sad
you
know
his
wife
poor
indeed
what
of
her
asked
meekin
bestowing
a
condescending
bow
on
a
is
she
an
invalid
she
is
dead
poor
soul
returned
jolly
jellicoe
with
a
fat
sigh
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
heard
the
story
meekin
my
dear
leddies
i
have
only
been
in
hobart
town
a
week
and
i
have
not
heard
the
it
about
the
mutiny
you
know
the
mutiny
at
macquarie
harbour
the
prisoners
took
the
ship
and
put
vickers
and
sylvia
ashore
somewhere
captain
frere
was
with
them
too
the
poor
things
had
a
dreadful
time
and
nearly
died
captain
frere
made
a
boat
at
last
and
they
were
picked
up
by
a
ship
poor
vickers
only
lived
a
few
hours
and
little
sylvia
she
was
only
twelve
years
old
then
was
quite
they
thought
she
would
how
dreadful
and
has
she
recovered
oh
yes
she
quite
strong
now
but
her
memory
her
memory
yes
struck
in
protherick
eager
to
have
a
share
in
the
storytelling
she
does
remember
anything
about
the
three
or
four
weeks
they
were
ashore
at
least
not
it
a
great
mercy
interrupted
jellicoe
determined
to
keep
the
post
of
honour
who
wants
her
to
remember
these
horrors
from
captain
frere
account
it
was
positively
awful
you
do
say
so
said
meekin
dabbing
his
nose
with
a
dainty
handkerchief
a
that
what
we
call
an
escaped
prisoner
meekin
happened
to
be
left
behind
and
he
found
them
out
and
insisted
on
sharing
the
provisions
the
wretch
captain
frere
was
obliged
to
watch
him
constantly
for
fear
he
should
murder
them
even
in
the
boat
he
tried
to
run
them
out
to
sea
and
escape
he
was
one
of
the
worst
men
in
the
harbour
they
say
but
you
should
hear
captain
frere
tell
the
and
where
is
he
now
asked
meekin
with
interest
captain
frere
no
the
oh
goodness
i
do
know
at
port
arthur
i
think
i
know
that
he
was
tried
for
bolting
and
would
have
been
hanged
but
for
captain
dear
dear
a
strange
story
indeed
said
meekin
and
so
the
young
lady
does
know
anything
about
it
only
what
she
has
been
told
of
course
poor
dear
she
engaged
to
captain
really
to
the
man
who
saved
her
how
charming
quite
a
romance
is
it
everybody
says
so
and
captain
frere
so
much
older
than
she
but
her
girlish
love
clings
to
her
heroic
protector
said
meekin
mildly
poetical
remarkable
and
beautiful
quite
the
hem
the
ivy
and
the
oak
dear
leddies
ah
in
our
fallen
nature
what
sweet
spots
i
think
this
is
the
a
smart
convict
servant
he
had
been
a
pickpocket
of
note
in
days
gone
by
left
the
clergyman
to
repose
in
a
handsomely
furnished
whose
sun
blinds
revealed
a
wealth
of
bright
garden
flecked
with
shadows
while
he
went
in
search
of
miss
vickers
the
major
was
out
it
seemed
his
duties
as
superintendent
of
convicts
rendering
such
absences
necessary
but
miss
vickers
was
in
the
garden
and
could
be
called
in
at
once
the
reverend
meekin
wiping
his
heated
brow
and
pulling
down
his
spotless
wristbands
laid
himself
back
on
the
soft
sofa
soothed
by
the
elegant
surroundings
no
less
than
by
the
coolness
of
the
atmosphere
having
no
better
comparison
at
hand
he
compared
this
luxurious
room
with
its
soft
couches
brilliant
flowers
and
opened
piano
to
the
chamber
in
the
house
of
a
west
india
planter
where
all
was
glare
and
heat
and
barbarism
without
and
all
soft
and
cool
and
luxurious
within
he
was
so
charmed
with
this
comparison
he
had
a
knack
of
being
easily
pleased
with
his
own
thoughts
that
he
commenced
to
turn
a
fresh
sentence
for
the
bishop
and
to
sketch
out
an
elegant
description
of
the
oasis
in
his
desert
of
a
vineyard
while
at
this
occupation
he
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
voices
in
the
garden
and
it
appeared
to
him
that
someone
near
at
hand
was
sobbing
and
crying
softly
stepping
on
the
broad
verandah
he
saw
on
the
two
persons
an
old
man
and
a
young
girl
the
sobbing
proceeded
from
the
old
man
miss
it
the
truth
on
my
soul
i
but
jest
come
back
to
yez
this
morning
o
my
but
it
a
cruel
trick
to
play
an
ould
he
was
a
old
fellow
in
a
grey
suit
of
convict
frieze
and
stood
leaning
with
one
veiny
hand
upon
the
pedestal
of
a
vase
of
roses
but
it
is
your
own
fault
danny
we
all
warned
you
against
her
said
the
young
girl
softly
sure
ye
did
but
oh
how
did
i
think
it
miss
is
the
second
time
she
served
me
how
long
was
it
this
time
danny
six
months
miss
she
said
i
was
a
drunkard
and
beat
her
beat
her
god
help
me
stretching
forth
two
trembling
hands
and
they
believed
her
o
course
now
when
i
kem
back
there
me
little
place
all
thrampled
by
the
boys
and
she
away
wid
a
ship
captain
saving
your
presence
miss
dhrinking
in
the
the
fourth
o
my
but
hard
on
an
old
man
and
he
fell
to
sobbing
again
the
girl
sighed
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
danny
i
dare
say
you
can
work
about
the
garden
as
you
did
before
i
speak
to
the
major
when
he
comes
danny
lifting
his
bleared
eyes
to
thank
her
caught
sight
of
meekin
and
saluted
abruptly
miss
vickers
turned
and
meekin
bowing
his
apologies
became
conscious
that
the
young
lady
was
about
seventeen
years
of
age
that
her
eyes
were
large
and
soft
her
hair
plentiful
and
bright
and
that
the
hand
which
held
the
little
book
she
had
been
reading
was
white
and
small
miss
vickers
i
think
my
name
is
meekin
the
reverend
arthur
how
do
you
do
meekin
said
sylvia
putting
out
one
of
her
small
hands
and
looking
straight
at
him
papa
will
be
in
his
daughter
more
than
compensates
for
his
absence
my
dear
miss
i
do
like
flattery
meekin
so
do
use
it
at
least
she
added
with
a
delicious
frankness
that
seemed
born
of
her
very
brightness
and
beauty
not
that
sort
of
flattery
young
girls
do
like
flattery
of
course
do
you
think
so
this
rapid
attack
quite
disconcerted
meekin
and
he
could
only
bow
and
smile
at
the
young
lady
go
into
the
kitchen
danny
and
tell
them
to
give
you
some
tobacco
say
i
sent
you
meekin
wo
you
come
in
a
strange
old
gentleman
that
miss
vickers
a
faithful
retainer
i
presume
an
old
convict
servant
of
ours
said
sylvia
he
was
with
papa
many
years
ago
he
has
got
into
trouble
lately
though
poor
old
into
trouble
asked
meekin
as
sylvia
took
off
her
hat
on
the
roads
you
know
that
what
they
call
it
here
he
married
a
free
woman
much
younger
than
himself
and
she
makes
him
drink
and
then
gives
him
in
charge
for
for
insubordination
pardon
me
my
dear
young
lady
did
i
understand
you
rightly
yes
insubordination
he
is
her
assigned
servant
you
know
said
sylvia
as
if
such
a
condition
of
things
was
the
most
ordinary
in
the
world
and
if
he
misbehaves
himself
she
sends
him
back
to
the
the
reverend
meekin
opened
his
mild
eyes
very
wide
indeed
what
an
extraordinary
anomaly
i
am
beginning
my
dear
miss
vickers
to
find
myself
indeed
at
the
society
here
is
different
from
society
in
england
i
believe
most
new
arrivals
say
so
returned
sylvia
quietly
but
for
a
wife
to
imprison
her
husband
my
dear
young
lady
she
can
have
him
flogged
if
she
likes
danny
has
been
flogged
but
then
his
wife
is
a
bad
woman
he
was
very
silly
to
marry
her
but
you
reason
with
an
old
man
in
love
meekin
christian
brow
had
grown
crimson
and
his
decorous
blood
tingled
to
his
to
hear
a
young
lady
talk
in
such
an
open
way
was
terrible
why
in
reading
the
decalogue
from
the
altar
meekin
was
accustomed
to
soften
one
indecent
prohibition
lest
its
uncompromising
plainness
of
speech
might
offend
the
delicate
sensibilities
of
his
female
souls
he
turned
from
the
dangerous
theme
without
an
instant
pause
for
wonder
at
the
strange
power
accorded
to
hobart
town
free
wives
you
have
been
reading
et
virginie
i
have
read
it
before
in
ah
you
read
french
then
my
dear
young
lady
not
very
well
i
had
a
master
for
some
months
but
papa
had
to
send
him
back
to
the
gaol
again
he
stole
a
silver
tankard
out
of
the
a
french
master
stole
he
was
a
prisoner
you
know
a
clever
man
he
wrote
for
the
london
magazine
i
have
read
his
writings
some
of
them
are
quite
above
the
and
how
did
he
come
to
be
transported
asked
meekin
feeling
that
his
vineyard
was
getting
larger
than
he
had
anticipated
poisoning
his
niece
i
think
but
i
forget
the
particulars
he
was
a
gentlemanly
man
but
oh
such
a
drunkard
meekin
more
astonished
than
ever
at
this
strange
country
where
beautiful
young
ladies
talked
of
poisoning
and
flogging
as
matters
of
little
moment
where
wives
imprisoned
their
husbands
and
murderers
taught
french
perfumed
the
air
with
his
cambric
handkerchief
in
silence
you
have
not
been
here
long
meekin
said
sylvia
after
a
pause
no
only
a
week
and
i
confess
i
am
surprised
a
lovely
climate
but
as
i
said
just
now
to
jellicoe
the
trail
of
the
serpent
the
trail
of
the
serpent
my
dear
young
if
you
send
all
the
wretches
in
england
here
you
must
expect
the
trail
of
the
serpent
said
sylvia
it
is
the
fault
of
the
oh
no
certainly
not
returned
meekin
hastening
to
apologize
but
it
is
very
well
you
gentlemen
should
make
it
better
i
do
know
what
the
penal
settlements
are
like
but
the
prisoners
in
the
town
have
not
much
inducement
to
become
good
they
have
the
beautiful
liturgy
of
our
holy
church
read
to
them
twice
every
week
my
dear
young
lady
said
meekin
as
though
he
should
solemnly
say
if
that
does
reform
them
what
will
oh
yes
returned
sylvia
they
have
that
certainly
but
that
is
only
on
sundays
but
do
let
us
talk
about
this
meekin
she
added
pushing
back
a
stray
curl
of
golden
hair
papa
says
that
i
am
not
to
talk
about
these
things
because
they
are
all
done
according
to
the
rules
of
the
service
as
he
calls
an
admirable
notion
of
papa
said
meekin
much
relieved
as
the
door
opened
and
vickers
and
frere
entered
vickers
hair
had
grown
white
but
frere
carried
his
thirty
years
as
easily
as
some
men
carry
my
dear
sylvia
began
vickers
here
an
extraordinary
thing
and
then
becoming
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
agitated
meekin
he
paused
you
know
meekin
papa
said
sylvia
mr
meekin
captain
i
have
that
pleasure
said
vickers
glad
to
see
you
sir
pray
sit
upon
which
meekin
beheld
sylvia
unaffectedly
kiss
both
gentlemen
but
became
strangely
aware
that
the
kiss
bestowed
upon
her
father
was
warmer
than
that
which
greeted
her
affianced
husband
warm
weather
meekin
said
frere
sylvia
my
darling
i
hope
you
have
not
been
out
in
the
heat
you
have
my
dear
i
begged
you
it
not
hot
at
all
said
sylvia
pettishly
nonsense
i
not
made
of
butter
i
melt
thank
you
dear
you
need
pull
the
blind
and
then
as
though
angry
with
herself
for
her
anger
she
added
you
are
always
thinking
of
me
maurice
and
gave
him
her
hand
affectionately
it
very
oppressive
captain
frere
said
meekin
and
to
a
stranger
quite
have
a
glass
of
wine
said
frere
as
if
the
house
was
his
own
one
wants
bucking
up
a
bit
on
a
day
like
ay
to
be
sure
repeated
vickers
a
glass
of
wine
sylvia
dear
some
sherry
i
hope
she
has
not
been
attacking
you
with
her
strange
theories
oh
dear
no
not
at
all
returned
meekin
feeling
that
this
charming
young
lady
was
regarded
as
a
creature
who
was
not
to
be
judged
by
ordinary
rules
we
got
on
famously
my
dear
that
right
said
vickers
she
is
very
is
my
little
girl
and
strangers
ca
understand
her
sometimes
can
they
poppet
poppet
tossed
her
head
saucily
i
do
know
she
said
why
they
but
you
were
going
to
say
something
extraordinary
when
you
came
in
what
is
it
dear
ah
said
vickers
with
grave
face
yes
a
most
extraordinary
thing
they
caught
those
what
you
do
mean
no
papa
said
sylvia
turning
round
with
alarmed
face
in
that
little
family
there
were
for
conversational
purposes
but
one
set
of
villains
in
the
world
the
mutineers
of
the
osprey
they
got
four
of
them
in
the
bay
at
this
moment
rex
barker
shiers
and
lesly
they
are
on
board
the
lady
jane
the
most
extraordinary
story
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
the
fellows
got
to
china
and
passed
themselves
off
as
shipwrecked
sailors
the
merchants
in
canton
got
up
a
subscription
and
sent
them
to
london
they
were
recognized
there
by
old
pine
who
had
been
surgeon
on
board
the
ship
they
came
out
sylvia
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
with
heightened
colour
and
where
are
the
others
two
were
executed
in
england
the
other
six
have
not
been
taken
these
fellows
have
been
sent
out
for
to
what
are
you
alluding
dear
sir
asked
meekin
eyeing
the
sherry
with
the
gaze
of
a
fasting
saint
the
piracy
of
a
convict
brig
five
years
ago
replied
vickers
the
scoundrels
put
my
poor
wife
and
child
ashore
and
left
them
to
starve
if
it
had
been
for
frere
god
bless
him
they
would
have
died
they
shot
the
pilot
and
a
soldier
and
but
it
a
long
i
have
heard
of
it
already
said
meekin
sipping
the
sherry
which
another
convict
servant
had
brought
for
him
and
of
your
gallant
conduct
captain
oh
that
nothing
said
frere
reddening
we
were
all
in
the
same
boat
poppet
have
a
glass
of
wine
no
said
sylvia
i
do
want
she
was
staring
at
the
strip
of
sunshine
between
the
verandah
and
the
blind
as
though
the
bright
light
might
enable
her
to
remember
something
what
the
matter
asked
frere
bending
over
her
i
was
trying
to
recollect
but
i
ca
maurice
it
is
all
confused
i
only
remember
a
great
shore
and
a
great
sea
and
two
men
one
of
whom
you
dear
carried
me
in
his
dear
dear
said
meekin
she
was
quite
a
baby
said
vickers
hastily
as
though
unwilling
to
admit
that
her
illness
had
been
the
cause
of
her
forgetfulness
oh
no
i
was
twelve
years
old
said
sylvia
that
not
a
baby
you
know
but
i
think
the
fever
made
me
frere
looking
at
her
uneasily
shifted
in
his
seat
there
do
think
about
it
now
he
said
maurice
asked
she
suddenly
what
became
of
the
other
man
which
other
man
the
man
who
was
with
us
the
other
one
you
poor
bates
no
not
bates
the
prisoner
what
was
his
name
oh
ah
the
prisoner
said
frere
as
if
he
too
had
forgotten
why
you
know
darling
he
was
sent
to
port
ah
said
sylvia
with
a
shudder
and
is
he
there
still
i
believe
so
said
frere
with
a
frown
by
the
by
said
vickers
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
get
that
fellow
up
for
the
trial
we
have
to
identify
the
ca
you
and
i
do
that
asked
frere
uneasily
i
am
afraid
not
i
would
like
to
swear
to
a
man
after
five
by
george
said
frere
i
swear
to
him
when
once
i
see
a
face
that
enough
for
we
had
better
get
up
a
few
prisoners
who
were
at
the
harbour
at
the
time
said
vickers
as
if
wishing
to
terminate
the
discussion
i
would
let
the
villains
slip
through
my
fingers
for
and
are
the
men
at
port
arthur
old
men
asked
meekin
old
convicts
returned
vickers
it
our
place
for
sentence
men
the
worst
we
have
are
there
it
has
taken
the
place
of
macquarie
harbour
what
excitement
there
will
be
among
them
when
the
schooner
goes
down
on
monday
excitement
indeed
how
charming
why
asked
meekin
to
bring
up
the
witnesses
my
dear
sir
most
of
the
prisoners
are
lifers
you
see
and
a
trip
to
hobart
town
is
like
a
holiday
for
and
do
they
never
leave
the
place
when
sentenced
for
life
said
meekin
nibbling
a
biscuit
how
distressing
never
except
when
they
die
answered
frere
with
a
laugh
and
then
they
are
buried
on
an
island
oh
it
a
fine
place
you
should
come
down
with
me
and
have
a
look
at
it
meekin
picturesque
i
can
assure
my
dear
maurice
says
sylvia
going
to
the
piano
as
if
in
protest
to
the
turn
the
conversation
was
taking
how
can
you
talk
like
that
i
should
much
like
to
see
it
said
meekin
still
nibbling
for
sir
john
was
saying
something
about
a
chaplaincy
there
and
i
understand
that
the
climate
is
quite
the
convict
servant
who
had
entered
with
some
official
papers
for
the
major
stared
at
the
dainty
clergyman
and
rough
maurice
laughed
again
oh
it
a
stunning
climate
he
said
and
nothing
to
do
just
the
place
for
you
there
a
regular
little
colony
there
all
the
scandals
in
van
diemen
land
are
hatched
at
port
this
agreeable
chatter
about
scandal
and
climate
seemed
a
strange
contrast
to
the
island
and
the
men
who
were
prisoners
for
life
perhaps
sylvia
thought
so
for
she
struck
a
few
chords
which
compelling
the
party
out
of
sheer
politeness
to
cease
talking
for
the
moment
caused
the
conversation
to
flag
and
hinted
to
meekin
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
depart
good
afternoon
dear
miss
vickers
he
said
rising
with
his
sweetest
smile
thank
you
for
your
delightful
music
that
piece
is
an
old
old
favourite
of
mine
it
was
quite
a
favourite
of
dear
lady
jane
and
the
bishop
pray
excuse
me
my
dear
captain
frere
but
this
strange
occurrence
of
the
capture
of
the
wreckers
you
know
must
be
my
apology
for
touching
on
a
delicate
subject
how
charming
to
contemplate
yourself
and
your
dear
young
lady
the
preserved
and
preserver
dear
major
but
the
brave
you
know
none
but
the
brave
none
but
the
brave
deserve
the
fair
you
remember
glorious
john
of
course
well
good
it
rather
a
long
invitation
said
vickers
always
well
disposed
to
anyone
who
praised
his
daughter
but
if
you
nothing
better
to
do
come
and
dine
with
us
on
christmas
day
meekin
we
usually
have
a
little
gathering
charmed
said
meekin
charmed
i
am
sure
it
is
so
refreshing
to
meet
with
persons
of
one
own
tastes
in
this
delightful
colony
souls
together
knit
you
know
dear
miss
vickers
indeed
yes
once
more
good
sylvia
burst
into
laughter
as
the
door
closed
what
a
ridiculous
creature
said
she
bless
the
man
with
his
gloves
and
his
umbrella
and
his
hair
and
his
scent
fancy
that
mincing
noodle
showing
me
the
way
to
heaven
i
rather
have
old
bowes
papa
though
he
is
as
blind
as
a
beetle
and
makes
you
so
angry
by
bottling
up
his
trumps
as
you
call
my
dear
sylvia
said
vickers
seriously
mr
meekin
is
a
clergyman
you
oh
i
know
said
sylvia
but
then
a
clergyman
can
talk
like
a
man
ca
he
why
do
they
send
such
people
here
i
am
sure
they
could
do
much
better
at
home
oh
by
the
way
papa
dear
poor
old
danny
come
back
again
i
told
him
he
might
go
into
the
kitchen
may
he
dear
you
have
the
house
full
of
these
vagabonds
you
little
puss
said
vickers
kissing
her
i
suppose
i
must
let
him
stay
what
has
he
been
doing
now
his
wife
said
sylvia
locked
him
up
you
know
for
being
drunk
wife
what
do
people
want
with
wives
i
wonder
ask
maurice
said
her
father
smiling
sylvia
moved
away
and
tossed
her
head
what
does
he
know
about
it
maurice
you
are
a
great
bear
and
if
you
had
saved
my
life
you
know
i
should
love
you
a
bit
there
you
may
kiss
me
her
voice
grew
softer
this
convict
business
has
brought
it
all
back
and
i
should
be
ungrateful
if
i
did
love
you
maurice
frere
with
suddenly
crimsoned
face
accepted
the
proffered
caress
and
then
turned
to
the
window
a
man
was
working
in
the
garden
and
whistling
as
he
worked
they
not
so
badly
off
said
frere
under
his
breath
what
that
sir
asked
sylvia
that
i
am
not
half
good
enough
for
you
cried
frere
with
sudden
vehemence
i
it
my
happiness
you
got
to
think
of
captain
bruin
said
the
girl
you
saved
my
life
have
you
and
i
should
be
wicked
if
i
did
love
you
no
no
more
kisses
she
added
putting
out
her
hand
come
papa
it
cool
now
let
walk
in
the
garden
and
leave
maurice
to
think
of
his
own
maurice
watched
the
retreating
pair
with
a
puzzled
expression
she
always
leaves
me
for
her
father
he
said
to
himself
i
wonder
if
she
really
loves
me
or
if
it
only
gratitude
after
all
he
had
often
asked
himself
the
same
question
during
the
five
years
of
his
wooing
but
he
had
never
satisfactorily
answered
it
chapter
ii
sarah
purfoy
request
the
evening
passed
as
it
had
passed
a
hundred
times
before
and
having
smoked
a
pipe
at
the
barracks
captain
frere
returned
home
his
home
was
a
cottage
on
the
new
town
road
a
cottage
which
he
had
occupied
since
his
appointment
as
assistant
police
magistrate
an
appointment
given
to
him
as
a
reward
for
his
exertions
in
connection
with
the
osprey
mutiny
captain
maurice
frere
had
risen
in
life
quartered
in
hobart
town
he
had
assumed
a
position
in
society
and
had
held
several
of
those
excellent
appointments
which
in
the
year
were
bestowed
upon
officers
of
garrison
he
had
been
superintendent
of
works
at
bridgewater
and
when
he
got
his
captaincy
assistant
police
magistrate
at
bothwell
the
affair
of
the
osprey
made
a
noise
and
it
was
tacitly
resolved
that
the
first
good
thing
that
fell
vacant
should
be
given
to
the
gallant
preserver
of
major
vickers
child
major
vickers
also
prospered
he
had
always
been
a
careful
man
and
having
saved
some
money
had
purchased
land
on
favourable
terms
the
assignment
system
enabled
him
to
cultivate
portions
of
it
at
a
small
expense
and
following
the
usual
custom
he
stocked
his
run
with
cattle
and
sheep
he
had
sold
his
commission
and
was
now
a
comparatively
wealthy
man
he
owned
a
fine
estate
the
house
he
lived
in
was
purchased
property
he
was
in
good
odour
at
government
house
and
his
office
of
superintendent
of
convicts
caused
him
to
take
an
active
part
in
that
local
government
which
keeps
a
man
constantly
before
the
public
major
vickers
a
colonist
against
his
will
had
become
by
force
of
circumstances
one
of
the
leading
men
in
van
diemen
land
his
daughter
was
a
good
match
for
any
man
and
many
ensigns
and
lieutenants
cursing
their
hard
lot
in
country
quarters
many
sons
of
settlers
living
on
their
father
station
among
the
mountains
and
many
dapper
clerks
on
the
civil
establishment
envied
maurice
frere
his
good
fortune
some
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
beautiful
daughter
of
regulation
vickers
was
too
good
for
the
coarse
frere
who
was
noted
for
his
fondness
for
low
society
and
overbearing
almost
brutal
demeanour
no
one
denied
however
that
captain
frere
was
a
valuable
officer
it
was
said
that
in
consequence
of
his
tastes
he
knew
more
about
the
tricks
of
convicts
than
any
man
on
the
island
it
was
said
even
that
he
was
wont
to
disguise
himself
and
mix
with
the
and
convict
servants
in
order
to
learn
their
signs
and
mysteries
when
in
charge
at
bridgewater
it
had
been
his
delight
to
rate
the
in
their
own
hideous
jargon
and
to
astound
a
by
his
knowledge
of
his
previous
history
the
convict
population
hated
and
cringed
to
him
for
with
his
brutality
and
violence
he
mingled
a
ferocious
good
humour
that
resulted
sometimes
in
tacit
permission
to
go
without
the
letter
of
the
law
yet
as
the
convicts
themselves
said
a
man
was
never
safe
with
the
captain
for
after
drinking
and
joking
with
them
as
the
sir
oracle
of
some
whose
hostess
he
delighted
to
honour
he
would
disappear
through
a
side
door
just
as
the
constables
burst
in
at
the
back
and
show
himself
as
remorseless
in
his
next
sentence
of
the
captured
as
if
he
had
never
entered
a
in
all
his
life
his
superiors
called
this
zeal
his
inferiors
treachery
for
himself
he
laughed
everything
is
fair
to
those
wretches
he
was
accustomed
to
say
as
the
time
for
his
marriage
approached
however
he
had
in
a
measure
given
up
these
exploits
and
strove
by
his
demeanour
to
make
his
acquaintances
forget
several
remarkable
scandals
concerning
his
private
life
for
the
promulgation
of
which
he
once
cared
little
when
commandant
at
the
maria
island
and
for
the
first
two
years
after
his
return
from
the
unlucky
expedition
to
macquarie
harbour
he
had
not
suffered
any
fear
of
society
opinion
to
restrain
his
vices
but
as
the
affection
for
the
pure
young
girl
who
looked
upon
him
as
her
saviour
from
a
dreadful
death
increased
in
honest
strength
he
had
resolved
to
shut
up
those
dark
pages
in
his
colonial
experience
and
to
read
therein
no
more
he
was
not
remorseful
he
was
not
even
disgusted
he
merely
came
to
the
conclusion
that
when
a
man
married
he
was
to
consider
certain
extravagances
common
to
all
bachelors
as
at
an
end
he
had
had
his
fling
like
all
young
men
perhaps
he
had
been
foolish
like
most
young
men
but
no
reproachful
ghost
of
past
misdeeds
haunted
him
his
nature
was
too
prosaic
to
admit
the
existence
of
such
phantoms
sylvia
in
her
purity
and
excellence
was
so
far
above
him
that
in
raising
his
eyes
to
her
he
lost
sight
of
all
the
sordid
creatures
to
whose
level
he
had
once
debased
himself
and
had
come
in
part
to
regard
the
sins
he
had
committed
before
his
redemption
by
the
love
of
this
bright
young
creature
as
evil
done
by
him
under
a
past
condition
of
existence
and
for
the
consequences
of
which
he
was
not
responsible
one
of
the
consequences
however
was
very
close
to
him
at
this
moment
his
convict
servant
had
according
to
his
instructions
sat
up
for
him
and
as
he
entered
the
man
handed
him
a
letter
bearing
a
superscription
in
a
female
hand
who
brought
this
asked
frere
hastily
tearing
it
open
to
read
the
groom
sir
he
said
that
there
was
a
gentleman
at
the
the
fourth
who
wished
to
see
frere
smiled
in
admiration
of
the
intelligence
which
had
dictated
such
a
message
and
then
frowned
in
anger
at
the
contents
of
the
letter
you
need
wait
he
said
to
the
man
i
shall
have
to
go
back
again
i
changing
his
forage
cap
for
a
soft
hat
and
selecting
a
stick
from
a
miscellaneous
collection
in
a
corner
he
prepared
to
retrace
his
steps
what
does
she
want
now
he
asked
himself
fiercely
as
he
strode
down
the
moonlit
road
but
beneath
the
fierceness
there
was
an
of
petulance
which
implied
that
whatever
she
did
want
she
had
a
right
to
expect
the
george
the
fourth
was
a
long
low
house
situated
in
elizabeth
street
its
front
was
painted
a
dull
red
and
the
narrow
panes
of
glass
in
its
windows
and
the
ostentatious
affectation
of
red
curtains
and
homely
comfort
gave
to
it
a
spurious
appearance
of
old
english
jollity
a
knot
of
men
round
the
door
melted
into
air
as
captain
frere
approached
for
it
was
now
past
eleven
and
all
persons
found
in
the
streets
after
eight
could
be
compelled
to
show
their
pass
or
explain
their
business
the
convict
constables
were
not
scrupulous
in
the
exercise
of
their
duty
and
the
bluff
figure
of
frere
clad
in
the
blue
serge
which
he
affected
as
a
summer
costume
looked
not
unlike
that
of
a
convict
constable
pushing
open
the
side
door
with
the
confident
manner
of
one
well
acquainted
with
the
house
frere
entered
and
made
his
way
along
a
narrow
passage
to
a
glass
door
at
the
further
end
a
tap
upon
this
door
brought
a
irish
girl
who
curtsied
with
servile
recognition
of
the
visitor
and
ushered
him
upstairs
the
room
into
which
he
was
shown
was
a
large
one
it
had
three
windows
looking
into
the
street
and
was
handsomely
furnished
the
carpet
was
soft
the
candles
were
bright
and
the
supper
tray
gleamed
invitingly
from
a
table
between
the
windows
as
frere
entered
a
little
terrier
ran
barking
to
his
feet
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
a
constant
visitor
the
rustle
of
a
silk
dress
behind
the
terrier
betrayed
the
presence
of
a
woman
and
frere
rounding
the
promontory
of
an
ottoman
found
himself
face
to
face
with
sarah
purfoy
thank
you
for
coming
she
said
pray
sit
this
was
the
only
greeting
that
passed
between
them
and
frere
sat
down
in
obedience
to
a
motion
of
a
plump
hand
that
twinkled
with
rings
the
eleven
years
that
had
passed
since
we
last
saw
this
woman
had
dealt
gently
with
her
her
foot
was
as
small
and
her
hand
as
white
as
of
yore
her
hair
bound
close
about
her
head
was
plentiful
and
glossy
and
her
eyes
had
lost
none
of
their
dangerous
brightness
her
figure
was
coarser
and
the
white
arm
that
gleamed
through
a
muslin
sleeve
showed
an
outline
that
a
fastidious
artist
might
wish
to
modify
the
most
noticeable
change
was
in
her
face
the
cheeks
owned
no
longer
that
delicate
purity
which
they
once
boasted
but
had
become
thicker
while
here
and
there
showed
those
faint
red
streaks
as
though
the
rich
blood
throbbed
too
painfully
in
the
veins
which
are
the
first
signs
of
the
decay
of
fine
women
with
middle
age
and
the
fullness
of
figure
to
which
most
women
of
her
temperament
are
prone
had
come
also
that
indescribable
vulgarity
of
speech
and
manner
which
habitual
absence
of
moral
restraint
never
fails
to
produce
maurice
frere
spoke
first
he
was
anxious
to
bring
his
visit
to
as
speedy
a
termination
as
possible
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
sarah
purfoy
laughed
a
forced
laugh
that
sounded
so
unnatural
that
frere
turned
to
look
at
her
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favour
a
very
great
favour
that
is
if
it
will
not
put
you
out
of
the
what
do
you
mean
asked
frere
roughly
pursing
his
lips
with
a
sullen
air
favour
what
do
you
call
this
striking
the
sofa
on
which
he
sat
is
this
a
favour
what
do
you
call
your
precious
house
and
all
that
in
it
is
that
a
favour
what
do
you
mean
to
his
utter
astonishment
the
woman
replied
by
shedding
tears
for
some
time
he
regarded
her
in
silence
as
if
unwilling
to
be
softened
by
such
shallow
device
but
eventually
felt
constrained
to
say
something
have
you
been
drinking
again
he
asked
or
what
the
matter
with
you
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
and
have
done
with
it
i
do
know
what
possessed
me
to
come
here
at
sarah
sat
upright
and
dashed
away
her
tears
with
one
passionate
hand
i
am
ill
ca
you
see
you
fool
said
she
the
news
has
unnerved
me
if
i
have
been
drinking
what
then
it
nothing
to
you
is
it
oh
no
returned
the
other
it
nothing
to
me
you
are
the
principal
party
concerned
if
you
choose
to
bloat
yourself
with
brandy
do
it
by
all
you
do
pay
for
it
at
any
rate
said
she
with
quickness
of
retaliation
which
showed
that
this
was
not
the
only
occasion
on
which
they
had
quarrelled
come
said
frere
impatiently
brutal
get
on
i
ca
stop
here
all
she
suddenly
rose
and
crossed
to
where
he
was
standing
maurice
you
were
very
fond
of
me
once
said
maurice
not
so
very
many
years
hang
it
said
he
shifting
his
arm
from
beneath
her
hand
do
let
us
have
all
that
stuff
over
again
it
was
before
you
took
to
drinking
and
swearing
and
going
raving
mad
with
passion
any
well
dear
said
she
with
her
great
glittering
eyes
belying
the
soft
tones
of
her
voice
i
suffered
for
it
did
i
did
you
turn
me
out
into
the
streets
did
you
lash
me
with
your
whip
like
a
dog
you
put
me
in
gaol
for
it
eh
it
hard
to
struggle
against
you
the
compliment
to
his
obstinacy
seemed
to
please
him
perhaps
the
crafty
woman
intended
that
it
should
and
he
smiled
well
there
let
old
times
be
old
times
sarah
you
have
done
badly
after
all
and
he
looked
round
the
room
what
do
you
want
there
was
a
transport
came
in
this
well
you
know
who
was
on
board
her
maurice
maurice
brought
one
hand
into
the
palm
of
the
other
with
a
rough
laugh
oh
that
it
is
it
what
a
flat
i
was
not
to
think
of
it
before
you
want
to
see
him
i
suppose
she
came
close
to
him
and
in
her
earnestness
took
his
hand
i
want
to
save
his
life
oh
that
be
hanged
you
know
save
his
life
it
ca
be
you
can
do
it
i
save
john
rex
life
cried
frere
why
you
must
be
mad
he
is
the
only
creature
that
loves
me
maurice
the
only
man
who
cares
for
me
he
has
done
no
harm
he
only
wanted
to
be
free
was
it
not
natural
you
can
save
him
if
you
like
i
only
ask
for
his
life
what
does
it
matter
to
you
a
miserable
prisoner
his
death
would
be
of
no
use
let
him
live
maurice
laughed
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
you
are
the
principal
witness
against
him
if
you
say
that
he
behaved
well
and
he
did
behave
well
you
know
many
men
would
have
left
you
to
starve
they
wo
hang
oh
wo
they
that
wo
make
much
ah
maurice
be
merciful
she
bent
towards
him
and
tried
to
retain
his
hand
but
he
withdrew
it
you
a
nice
sort
of
woman
to
ask
me
to
help
your
lover
a
man
who
left
me
on
that
cursed
coast
to
die
for
all
he
cared
he
said
with
a
galling
recollection
of
his
humiliation
of
five
years
back
save
him
confound
him
not
i
ah
maurice
you
she
spoke
with
a
suppressed
sob
in
her
voice
what
is
it
to
you
you
do
care
for
me
now
you
beat
me
and
turned
me
out
of
doors
though
i
never
did
you
wrong
this
man
was
a
husband
to
me
long
long
before
i
met
you
he
never
did
you
any
harm
he
never
will
he
will
bless
you
if
you
save
him
frere
jerked
his
head
impatiently
bless
me
he
said
i
do
want
his
blessings
let
him
swing
who
cares
still
she
persisted
with
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
with
white
arms
upraised
on
her
knees
even
catching
at
his
coat
and
beseeching
him
in
broken
accents
in
her
wild
fierce
beauty
and
passionate
abandonment
she
might
have
been
a
deserted
ariadne
a
suppliant
medea
anything
rather
than
what
she
was
a
dissolute
woman
praying
for
the
pardon
of
her
convict
husband
maurice
frere
flung
her
off
with
an
oath

cried
brutally

nonsense

man
as
good
as
dead
for
all
i
shall
do
to
save
at
this
repulse
her
passion
broke
forth
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
pushing
back
the
hair
that
in
her
frenzied
pleading
had
fallen
about
her
face
poured
out
upon
him
a
torrent
of
abuse
you
who
are
you
that
you
dare
to
speak
to
me
like
that
his
little
finger
is
worth

scream

do
my
best
to
save
his
you
can
save
it
if
you
well
i
will
try
on
my
honour
i
will
i
must
believe
you
i
suppose
said
she
doubtfully
and
then
with
a
sudden
pitiful
pleading
in
strange
contrast
to
her
former
violence
you
are
not
deceiving
me
maurice
no
why
should
i
you
keep
your
promise
and
i
keep
mine
is
it
a
bargain
he
eyed
her
steadfastly
for
some
seconds
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
as
he
reached
the
door
she
called
him
back
knowing
him
as
she
did
she
felt
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
her
feminine
nature
could
not
resist
a
parting
sneer
there
is
nothing
in
the
bargain
to
prevent
me
helping
him
to
escape
she
said
with
a
smile
escape
he
wo
escape
again
i
go
bail
once
get
him
in
double
irons
at
port
arthur
and
he
safe
the
smile
on
her
face
seemed
infectious
for
his
own
sullen
features
relaxed
good
night
sarah
he
said
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
nothing
had
happened
good
night
captain
frere
it
a
bargain
then
a
you
have
a
long
walk
home
will
you
have
some
brandy
i
do
care
if
i
do
he
said
advancing
to
the
table
and
filling
his
glass
here
a
good
voyage
to
you
sarah
purfoy
watching
him
burst
into
a
laugh
human
beings
are
queer
creatures
she
said
who
would
have
thought
that
we
had
been
calling
each
other
names
just
now
i
say
i
a
vixen
when
i
roused
ai
i
maurice
remember
what
you
promised
said
he
with
a
threat
in
his
voice
as
he
moved
to
the
door
you
must
be
out
of
this
by
the
next
ship
that
never
fear
i
getting
into
the
cool
street
directly
and
seeing
the
calm
stars
shining
and
the
placid
water
sleeping
with
a
peace
in
which
he
had
no
share
he
strove
to
cast
off
the
nervous
fear
that
was
on
him
that
interview
had
frightened
him
for
it
had
made
him
think
it
was
hard
that
just
as
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
this
old
blot
should
come
through
to
the
clean
page
it
was
cruel
that
having
comfortably
forgotten
the
past
he
should
be
thus
rudely
reminded
of
it
chapter
iii
the
story
of
two
birds
of
prey
the
reader
of
the
foregoing
pages
has
doubtless
asked
himself
what
is
the
link
which
binds
together
john
rex
and
sarah
purfoy
in
the
year
there
lived
at
heliers
jersey
an
old
watchmaker
named
urban
purfoy
he
was
a
man
and
had
amassed
a
little
money
sufficient
to
give
his
an
education
above
the
common
in
those
days
at
sixteen
sarah
purfoy
was
an
precocious
girl
with
big
brown
eyes
she
had
a
bad
opinion
of
her
own
sex
and
an
immense
admiration
for
the
young
and
handsome
members
of
the
other
the
neighbours
said
that
she
was
too
high
and
mighty
for
her
rank
in
life
her
grandfather
said
she
was
a
beauty
and
like
her
poor
dear
mother
she
herself
thought
rather
meanly
of
her
personal
attractions
and
rather
highly
of
her
mental
ones
she
was
brimful
of
vitality
with
strong
passions
and
little
religious
sentiment
she
had
not
much
respect
for
moral
courage
for
she
did
not
understand
it
but
she
was
a
profound
admirer
of
personal
prowess
her
distaste
for
the
humdrum
life
she
was
leading
found
expression
in
a
rebellion
against
social
usages
she
courted
notoriety
by
eccentricities
of
dress
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
she
was
misunderstood
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
of
whom
women
say
it
is
a
pity
she
has
no
mother
and
men
it
is
a
pity
she
does
not
get
a
husband
and
who
say
to
themselves
when
shall
i
have
a
lover
there
was
no
lack
of
beings
of
this
latter
class
among
the
officers
quartered
in
fort
royal
and
fort
henry
but
the
female
population
of
the
island
was
free
and
numerous
and
in
the
embarrassment
of
riches
sarah
was
overlooked
though
she
adored
the
soldiery
her
first
lover
was
a
civilian
walking
one
day
on
the
cliff
she
met
a
young
man
he
was
tall
and
his
name
was
lemoine
he
was
the
son
of
a
somewhat
wealthy
resident
of
the
island
and
had
come
down
from
london
to
recruit
his
health
and
to
see
his
friends
sarah
was
struck
by
his
appearance
and
looked
back
at
him
he
had
been
struck
by
hers
and
looked
back
also
he
followed
her
and
spoke
to
her
some
remark
about
the
wind
or
the
weather
and
she
thought
his
voice
divine
they
got
into
conversation
about
scenery
lonely
walks
and
the
dullness
of
heliers
did
she
often
walk
there
would
she
be
there
tomorrow
she
lemoine
lifted
his
hat
and
went
back
to
dinner
rather
pleased
with
himself
they
met
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
lemoine
was
not
a
gentleman
but
he
had
lived
among
gentlemen
and
had
caught
something
of
their
manner
he
said
that
after
all
virtue
was
a
mere
name
and
that
when
people
were
powerful
and
rich
the
world
respected
them
more
than
if
they
had
been
honest
and
poor
sarah
agreed
with
this
sentiment
her
grandfather
was
honest
and
poor
and
yet
nobody
respected
him
at
least
not
with
such
respect
as
she
cared
to
acknowledge
in
addition
to
his
talent
for
argument
lemoine
was
handsome
and
had
money
he
showed
her
quite
a
handful
of
one
day
he
told
her
of
london
and
the
great
ladies
there
and
hinting
that
they
were
not
always
virtuous
drew
himself
up
with
a
moody
air
as
though
he
had
been
unhappily
the
cause
of
their
fatal
lapse
into
wickedness
sarah
did
not
wonder
at
this
in
the
least
had
she
been
a
great
lady
she
would
have
done
the
same
she
began
to
coquet
with
this
seductive
fellow
and
to
hint
to
him
that
she
had
too
much
knowledge
of
the
world
to
set
a
fictitious
value
upon
virtue
he
mistook
her
artfulness
for
innocence
and
thought
he
had
made
a
conquest
moreover
the
girl
was
pretty
and
when
dressed
properly
would
look
well
only
one
obstacle
stood
in
the
way
of
their
loves
the
dashing
profligate
was
poor
he
had
been
living
in
london
above
his
means
and
his
father
was
not
inclined
to
increase
his
allowance
sarah
liked
him
better
than
anybody
else
she
had
seen
but
there
are
two
sides
to
every
bargain
sarah
purfoy
must
go
to
london
in
vain
her
lover
sighed
and
swore
unless
he
would
promise
to
take
her
away
with
him
diana
was
not
more
chaste
the
more
virtuous
she
grew
the
more
vicious
did
lemoine
feel
his
desire
to
possess
her
increased
in
proportionate
ratio
to
her
resistance
and
at
last
he
borrowed
two
hundred
pounds
from
his
father
confidential
clerk
the
lemoines
were
merchants
by
profession
and
acceded
to
her
wishes
there
was
no
love
on
either
side
vanity
was
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
transaction
lemoine
did
not
like
to
be
beaten
sarah
sold
herself
for
a
passage
to
england
and
an
introduction
into
the
great
world
we
need
not
describe
her
career
at
this
epoch
suffice
it
to
say
that
she
discovered
that
vice
is
not
always
conducive
to
happiness
and
is
not
even
in
this
world
so
well
rewarded
as
its
earnest
practice
might
merit
sated
and
disappointed
she
soon
grew
tired
of
her
life
and
longed
to
escape
from
its
wearying
dissipations
at
this
juncture
she
fell
in
love
the
object
of
her
affections
was
one
lionel
crofton
crofton
was
tall
well
made
and
with
an
insinuating
address
his
features
were
too
strongly
marked
for
beauty
his
eyes
were
the
best
part
of
his
face
and
like
his
hair
they
were
jet
black
he
had
broad
shoulders
sinewy
limbs
and
small
hands
and
feet
his
head
was
round
and
but
it
bulged
a
little
over
the
ears
which
were
singularly
small
and
lay
close
to
his
head
with
this
man
barely
four
years
older
than
herself
sarah
at
seventeen
fell
violently
in
love
this
was
the
more
strange
as
though
fond
of
her
he
would
tolerate
no
caprices
and
possessed
an
ungovernable
temper
which
found
vent
in
curses
and
even
blows
he
seemed
to
have
no
profession
or
business
and
though
he
owned
a
good
address
he
was
even
less
of
a
gentleman
than
lemoine
yet
sarah
attracted
by
one
of
the
strange
sympathies
which
constitute
the
romance
of
such
women
lives
was
devoted
to
him
touched
by
her
affection
and
rating
her
intelligence
and
unscrupulousness
at
their
true
value
he
told
her
who
he
was
he
was
a
swindler
a
forger
and
a
thief
and
his
name
was
john
rex
when
she
heard
this
she
experienced
a
sinister
delight
he
told
her
of
his
plots
his
tricks
his
escapes
his
villainies
and
seeing
how
for
years
this
young
man
had
preyed
upon
the
world
which
had
deceived
and
disowned
her
her
heart
went
out
to
him
i
am
glad
you
found
me
she
said
two
heads
are
better
than
one
we
will
work
john
rex
known
among
his
intimate
associates
as
dandy
jack
was
the
putative
son
of
a
man
who
had
been
for
many
years
valet
to
lord
bellasis
and
who
retired
from
the
service
of
that
profligate
nobleman
with
a
sum
of
money
and
a
wife
john
rex
was
sent
to
as
good
a
school
as
could
be
procured
for
him
and
at
sixteen
was
given
by
the
interest
of
his
mother
with
his
father
former
master
a
clerkship
in
an
city
rex
was
intensely
fond
of
her
son
and
imbued
him
with
a
desire
to
shine
in
aristocratic
circles
he
was
a
clever
lad
without
any
principle
he
would
lie
unblushingly
and
steal
deliberately
if
he
thought
he
could
do
so
with
impunity
he
was
cautious
acquisitive
imaginative
and
destructive
he
had
strong
perceptive
faculties
and
much
invention
and
versatility
but
his
moral
sense
was
almost
entirely
wanting
he
found
that
his
fellow
clerks
were
not
of
that
gentlemanly
stamp
which
his
mother
thought
so
admirable
and
therefore
he
despised
them
he
thought
he
should
like
to
go
into
the
army
for
he
was
athletic
and
rejoiced
in
feats
of
muscular
strength
to
be
tied
all
day
to
a
desk
was
beyond
endurance
but
john
rex
senior
told
him
to
wait
and
see
what
came
of
he
did
so
and
in
the
meantime
kept
late
hours
got
into
bad
company
and
forged
the
name
of
a
customer
of
the
bank
to
a
cheque
for
twenty
pounds
the
fraud
was
a
clumsy
one
and
was
detected
in
hours
forgeries
by
clerks
however
easily
detected
are
unfortunately
not
considered
to
add
to
the
attractions
of
a
and
the
firm
decided
not
to
prosecute
but
dismissed
john
rex
from
their
service
the
who
never
liked
his
legalized
son
was
at
first
for
turning
him
out
of
doors
but
by
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
was
at
last
induced
to
place
the
promising
boy
in
a
draper
shop
in
the
city
road
this
employment
was
not
a
congenial
one
and
john
rex
planned
to
leave
it
he
lived
at
home
and
had
his
salary
about
thirty
shillings
a
week
for
pocket
money
though
he
displayed
considerable
skill
with
the
cue
and
not
infrequently
won
considerable
sums
for
one
in
his
position
his
expenses
averaged
more
than
his
income
and
having
borrowed
all
he
could
he
found
himself
again
in
difficulties
his
narrow
escape
however
had
taught
him
a
lesson
and
he
resolved
to
confess
all
to
his
indulgent
mother
and
be
more
economical
for
the
future
just
then
one
of
those
lucky
chances
which
blight
so
many
lives
occurred
the
died
and
baffaty
made
the
gentlemanly
rex
act
as
his
substitute
for
a
few
days
have
opportunities
not
accorded
to
other
folks
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
rex
went
home
with
a
bundle
of
lace
in
his
pocket
unfortunately
he
owed
more
than
the
worth
of
this
petty
theft
and
was
compelled
to
steal
again
this
time
he
was
detected
one
of
his
caught
him
in
the
very
act
of
concealing
a
roll
of
silk
ready
for
future
abstraction
and
to
his
astonishment
cried
halves
rex
pretended
to
be
virtuously
indignant
but
soon
saw
that
such
pretence
was
useless
his
companion
was
too
wily
to
be
fooled
with
such
affectation
of
innocence
i
saw
you
take
it
said
he
and
if
you
wo
share
tell
old
this
argument
was
irresistible
and
they
shared
having
become
good
friends
the
partner
lent
rex
a
helping
hand
in
the
disposal
of
the
booty
and
introduced
him
to
a
purchaser
the
purchaser
violated
all
rules
of
romance
by
being
not
a
jew
but
a
very
orthodox
christian
he
kept
a
clothes
warehouse
in
the
city
road
and
was
supposed
to
have
branch
establishments
all
over
london
blicks
purchased
the
stolen
goods
for
about
a
third
of
their
value
and
seemed
struck
by
rex
appearance
i
thort
you
was
a
swell
mobsman
said
he
this
from
one
so
experienced
was
a
high
compliment
encouraged
by
success
rex
and
his
companion
took
more
articles
of
value
john
rex
paid
off
his
debts
and
began
to
feel
himself
quite
a
gentleman
again
just
as
rex
had
arrived
at
this
pleasing
state
of
mind
baffaty
discovered
the
robbery
not
having
heard
about
the
bank
business
he
did
not
suspect
rex
he
was
such
a
gentlemanly
young
man
but
having
had
his
eye
for
some
time
upon
rex
partner
who
was
vulgar
and
squinted
he
sent
for
him
rex
partner
stoutly
denied
the
accusation
and
old
baffaty
who
was
a
man
of
merciful
tendencies
and
could
well
afford
to
lose
fifty
pounds
gave
him
until
the
next
morning
to
confess
and
state
where
the
goods
had
gone
hinting
at
the
persuasive
powers
of
a
constable
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
shopman
with
tears
in
his
eyes
came
in
a
hurry
to
rex
and
informed
him
that
all
was
lost
he
did
not
want
to
confess
because
he
must
implicate
his
friend
rex
but
if
he
did
not
confess
he
would
be
given
in
charge
flight
was
impossible
for
neither
had
money
in
this
dilemma
john
rex
remembered
blicks
compliment
and
burned
to
deserve
it
if
he
must
retreat
he
would
lay
waste
the
enemy
country
his
exodus
should
be
like
that
of
the
israelites
he
would
spoil
the
egyptians
the
was
allowed
half
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
for
lunch
john
rex
took
advantage
of
this
to
hire
a
cab
and
drive
to
blicks
that
worthy
man
received
him
cordially
for
he
saw
that
he
was
bent
upon
great
deeds
john
rex
rapidly
unfolded
his
plan
of
operations
the
warehouse
doors
were
fastened
with
a
spring
he
would
remain
behind
after
they
were
locked
and
open
them
at
a
given
signal
a
light
cart
or
cab
could
be
stationed
in
the
lane
at
the
back
three
men
could
fill
it
with
valuables
in
as
many
hours
did
blicks
know
of
three
such
men
blicks
one
eye
glistened
he
thought
he
did
know
at
eleven
they
should
be
there
was
that
all
no
john
rex
was
not
going
to
put
up
such
a
splendid
thing
for
nothing
the
booty
was
worth
at
least
if
it
was
worth
a
shilling
he
must
have
cash
when
the
cart
stopped
at
blicks
door
blicks
at
first
refused
point
blank
let
there
be
a
division
but
he
would
not
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
rex
was
firm
however
it
was
his
only
chance
and
at
last
he
got
a
promise
of
that
night
the
glorious
achievement
known
in
the
annals
of
bow
street
as
the
great
silk
robbery
took
place
and
two
days
afterwards
john
rex
and
his
partner
dining
comfortably
at
birmingham
read
an
account
of
the
transaction
not
in
the
least
like
it
in
a
london
paper
john
rex
who
had
now
fairly
broken
with
dull
respectability
bid
adieu
to
his
home
and
began
to
realize
his
mother
wishes
he
was
after
his
fashion
a
gentleman
as
long
as
the
lasted
he
lived
in
luxury
and
by
the
time
it
was
spent
he
had
established
himself
in
his
profession
this
profession
was
a
lucrative
one
it
was
that
of
a
swindler
gifted
with
a
handsome
person
facile
manner
and
ready
wit
he
had
added
to
these
natural
advantages
some
skill
at
billiards
some
knowledge
of
gambler
legerdemain
and
the
useful
consciousness
that
he
must
prey
or
be
preyed
on
john
rex
was
no
common
swindler
his
natural
as
well
as
his
acquired
abilities
saved
him
from
vulgar
errors
he
saw
that
to
successfully
swindle
mankind
one
must
not
aim
at
comparative
but
superlative
ingenuity
he
who
is
contented
with
being
only
cleverer
than
the
majority
must
infallibly
be
outwitted
at
last
and
to
be
once
outwitted
is
for
a
swindler
to
be
ruined
examining
moreover
into
the
history
of
detected
crime
john
rex
discovered
one
thing
at
the
bottom
of
all
these
robberies
deceptions
and
swindles
was
some
lucky
fellow
who
profited
by
the
folly
of
his
confederates
this
gave
him
an
idea
suppose
he
could
not
only
make
use
of
his
own
talents
to
rob
mankind
but
utilize
those
of
others
also
crime
runs
through
infinite
grades
he
proposed
to
himself
to
be
at
the
top
but
why
should
he
despise
those
good
fellows
beneath
him
his
speciality
was
swindling
borrowing
money
obtaining
goods
never
risking
more
than
two
or
three
coups
in
a
year
but
others
plundered
houses
stole
bracelets
watches
diamonds
made
as
much
in
a
night
as
he
did
in
six
months
only
their
occupation
was
more
dangerous
now
came
the
question
why
more
dangerous
because
these
men
were
mere
clods
bold
enough
and
clever
enough
in
their
own
rude
way
but
no
match
for
the
law
with
its
argus
eyes
and
its
briarean
hands
they
did
the
rougher
business
well
enough
they
broke
locks
and
burst
doors
and
neddied
constables
but
in
the
finer
arts
of
plan
attack
and
escape
they
were
sadly
deficient
good
these
men
should
be
the
hands
he
would
be
the
head
he
would
plan
the
robberies
they
should
execute
them
working
through
many
channels
and
never
omitting
to
assist
a
when
in
distress
john
rex
in
a
few
years
and
in
a
most
prosaic
business
way
became
the
head
of
a
society
of
ruffians
mixing
with
fast
clerks
and
unsuspecting
profligates
he
found
out
particulars
of
houses
ill
guarded
and
shops
insecurely
fastened
and
put
up
blicks
ready
ruffians
to
the
more
dangerous
work
in
his
various
disguises
and
under
his
many
names
he
found
his
way
into
those
upper
circles
of
fast
society
where
animals
turn
into
birds
where
a
wolf
becomes
a
rook
and
a
lamb
a
pigeon
rich
spendthrifts
who
affected
male
society
asked
him
to
their
houses
and
anthony
croftonbury
captain
james
craven
and
lionel
crofton
were
names
remembered
sometimes
with
pleasure
oftener
with
regret
by
many
a
broken
man
of
fortune
he
had
one
quality
which
to
a
man
of
his
profession
was
invaluable
he
was
cautious
and
master
of
himself
having
made
a
success
wrung
commission
from
blicks
rooked
a
gambling
ninny
like
lemoine
or
secured
an
assortment
of
jewellery
sent
down
to
his
wife
in
gloucestershire
he
would
disappear
for
a
time
he
liked
comfort
and
revelled
in
the
sense
of
security
and
respectability
thus
he
had
lived
for
three
years
when
he
met
sarah
purfoy
and
thus
he
proposed
to
live
for
many
more
with
this
woman
as
a
coadjutor
he
thought
he
could
defy
the
law
she
was
the
net
spread
to
catch
his
pigeons
she
was
the
lady
who
ordered
goods
in
london
for
her
husband
at
canterbury
and
paid
half
the
price
down
which
was
all
this
letter
authorized
her
to
do
and
where
a
less
beautiful
or
clever
woman
might
have
failed
she
succeeded
her
husband
saw
fortune
before
him
and
believed
that
with
common
prudence
he
might
carry
on
his
most
lucrative
employment
of
gentleman
until
he
chose
to
relinquish
it
alas
for
human
weakness
he
one
day
did
a
foolish
thing
and
the
law
he
had
so
successfully
defied
got
him
in
the
simplest
way
imaginable
under
the
names
of
and
skinner
john
rex
and
sarah
purfoy
were
living
in
quiet
lodgings
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bloomsbury
their
landlady
was
a
respectable
poor
woman
and
had
a
son
who
was
a
constable
this
son
was
given
to
talking
and
coming
in
to
supper
one
night
he
told
his
mother
that
on
the
following
evening
an
attack
was
to
be
made
on
a
gang
of
coiners
in
the
old
street
road
the
mother
dreaming
all
sorts
of
horrors
during
the
night
came
the
next
day
to
skinner
in
the
parlour
and
under
a
pledge
of
profound
secrecy
told
her
of
the
dreadful
expedition
in
which
her
son
was
engaged
john
rex
was
out
at
a
pigeon
match
with
lord
bellasis
and
when
he
returned
at
nine
sarah
told
him
what
she
had
heard
now
old
street
road
was
the
residence
of
a
man
named
green
who
had
for
some
time
carried
on
the
lucrative
but
dangerous
trade
of
counterfeiting
this
man
was
one
of
the
most
daring
of
that
army
of
ruffians
whose
treasure
chest
and
master
of
the
mint
was
blicks
and
his
liberty
was
valuable
john
rex
eating
his
dinner
more
nervously
than
usual
ruminated
on
the
intelligence
and
thought
it
would
be
but
wise
to
warn
green
of
his
danger
not
that
he
cared
much
for
green
personally
but
it
was
bad
policy
to
miss
doing
a
good
turn
to
a
comrade
and
moreover
green
if
captured
might
wag
his
tongue
too
freely
but
how
to
do
it
if
he
went
to
blicks
it
might
be
too
late
he
would
go
himself
he
went
out
and
was
captured
when
sarah
heard
of
the
calamity
she
set
to
work
to
help
him
she
collected
all
her
money
and
jewels
paid
skinner
rent
went
to
see
rex
and
arranged
his
defence
blicks
was
hopeful
but
green
who
came
very
near
hanging
admitted
that
the
man
was
an
associate
of
his
and
the
recorder
being
in
a
severe
mood
transported
him
for
seven
years
sarah
purfoy
vowed
that
she
would
follow
him
she
was
going
as
passenger
as
emigrant
anything
when
she
saw
vickers
advertisement
for
a
and
answered
it
it
chanced
that
rex
was
shipped
in
the
malabar
and
sarah
discovering
this
before
the
vessel
had
been
a
week
at
sea
conceived
the
bold
project
of
inciting
a
mutiny
for
the
rescue
of
her
lover
we
know
the
result
of
that
scheme
and
the
story
of
the
scoundrel
subsequent
escape
from
macquarie
harbour
chapter
iv
the
notorious
the
mutineers
of
the
osprey
had
been
long
since
given
up
as
dead
and
the
story
of
their
desperate
escape
had
become
indistinct
to
the
general
public
mind
now
that
they
had
been
recaptured
in
a
remarkable
manner
popular
belief
invested
them
with
all
sorts
of
strange
surroundings
they
had
been
according
to
report
kings
over
savage
islanders
chiefs
of
lawless
and
ferocious
pirates
respectable
married
men
in
java
merchants
in
singapore
and
swindlers
in
hong
kong
their
adventures
had
been
dramatized
at
a
london
theatre
and
the
popular
novelist
of
that
day
was
engaged
in
a
work
descriptive
of
their
wondrous
fortunes
john
rex
the
ringleader
was
related
it
was
said
to
a
noble
family
and
a
special
message
had
come
out
to
sir
john
franklin
concerning
him
he
had
every
prospect
of
being
satisfactorily
hung
however
for
even
the
most
outspoken
admirers
of
his
skill
and
courage
could
not
but
admit
that
he
had
committed
an
offence
which
was
death
by
the
law
the
crown
would
leave
nothing
undone
to
convict
him
and
the
already
crowded
prison
was
with
half
a
dozen
life
sentence
men
brought
up
from
port
arthur
to
identify
the
prisoners
amongst
this
number
was
stated
to
be
the
notorious
dawes
this
statement
gave
fresh
food
for
recollection
and
invention
it
was
remembered
that
the
notorious
dawes
was
the
absconder
who
had
been
brought
away
by
captain
frere
and
who
owed
such
fettered
life
as
he
possessed
to
the
fact
that
he
had
assisted
captain
frere
to
make
the
wonderful
boat
in
which
the
marooned
party
escaped
it
was
remembered
also
how
sullen
and
morose
he
had
been
on
his
trial
five
years
before
and
how
he
had
laughed
when
the
commutation
of
his
death
sentence
was
announced
to
him
the
hobart
town
gazette
published
a
short
biography
of
this
horrible
villain
a
biography
setting
forth
how
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
mutiny
on
board
the
convict
ship
how
he
had
twice
escaped
from
the
macquarie
harbour
how
he
had
been
repeatedly
flogged
for
violence
and
insubordination
and
how
he
was
now
at
port
arthur
after
two
more
ineffectual
attempts
to
regain
his
freedom
indeed
the
gazette
discovering
that
the
wretch
had
been
originally
transported
for
highway
robbery
argued
very
ably
it
would
be
far
better
to
hang
such
wild
beasts
in
the
first
instance
than
suffer
them
to
cumber
the
ground
and
grow
confirmed
in
villainy
of
what
use
to
society
asked
the
gazette
quite
pathetically
has
this
scoundrel
been
during
the
last
eleven
years
and
everybody
agreed
that
he
had
been
of
no
use
whatever
miss
sylvia
vickers
also
received
an
additional
share
of
public
attention
her
romantic
rescue
by
the
heroic
frere
who
was
shortly
to
reap
the
reward
of
his
devotion
in
the
good
old
fashion
made
her
almost
as
famous
as
the
villain
dawes
or
his
confederate
monster
john
rex
it
was
reported
that
she
was
to
give
evidence
on
the
trial
together
with
her
affianced
husband
they
being
the
only
two
living
witnesses
who
could
speak
to
the
facts
of
the
mutiny
it
was
reported
also
that
her
lover
was
naturally
most
anxious
that
she
should
not
give
evidence
as
she
was
an
additional
point
of
romantic
interest
affected
deeply
by
the
illness
consequent
on
the
suffering
she
had
undergone
and
in
a
state
of
pitiable
mental
confusion
as
to
the
whole
business
these
reports
caused
the
court
on
the
day
of
the
trial
to
be
crowded
with
spectators
and
as
the
various
particulars
of
the
marvellous
history
of
this
double
escape
were
detailed
the
excitement
grew
more
intense
the
aspect
of
the
four
prisoners
caused
a
sensation
which
in
that
city
of
the
ironed
was
quite
novel
and
bets
were
offered
and
taken
as
to
the
line
of
defence
which
they
would
adopt
at
first
it
was
thought
that
they
would
throw
themselves
on
the
mercy
of
the
crown
seeking
in
the
very
extravagance
of
their
story
to
excite
public
sympathy
but
a
little
study
of
the
demeanour
of
the
chief
prisoner
john
rex
dispelled
that
conjecture
calm
placid
and
defiant
he
seemed
prepared
to
accept
his
fate
or
to
meet
his
accusers
with
some
plea
which
should
be
sufficient
to
secure
his
acquittal
on
the
capital
charge
only
when
he
heard
the
indictment
setting
forth
that
he
had
feloniously
pirated
the
brig
osprey
he
smiled
a
little
meekin
sitting
in
the
body
of
the
court
felt
his
religious
prejudices
sadly
shocked
by
that
smile
a
perfect
wild
beast
my
dear
miss
vickers
he
said
returning
in
a
pause
during
the
examination
of
the
convicts
who
had
been
brought
to
identify
the
prisoner
to
the
little
room
where
sylvia
and
her
father
were
waiting
he
has
quite
a
tigerish
look
about
poor
man
said
sylvia
with
a
shudder
poor
my
dear
young
lady
you
do
not
pity
him
i
do
said
sylvia
twisting
her
hands
together
as
if
in
pain
i
pity
them
all
poor
charming
sensibility
says
meekin
with
a
glance
at
vickers
the
true
woman
heart
my
dear
the
major
tapped
his
fingers
impatiently
at
this
twaddle
sylvia
was
too
nervous
just
then
for
sentiment
come
here
poppet
he
said
and
look
through
this
door
you
can
see
them
from
here
and
if
you
do
not
recognize
any
of
them
i
ca
see
what
is
the
use
of
putting
you
in
the
box
though
of
course
if
it
is
necessary
you
must
the
raised
dock
was
just
opposite
to
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
sitting
and
the
four
manacled
men
each
with
an
armed
warder
behind
him
were
visible
above
the
heads
of
the
crowd
the
girl
had
never
before
seen
the
ceremony
of
trying
a
man
for
his
life
and
the
silent
and
antique
solemnities
of
the
business
affected
her
as
it
affects
all
who
see
it
for
the
first
time
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
and
distressing
the
chains
of
the
prisoners
clanked
ominously
the
crushing
force
of
judge
gaolers
warders
and
constables
assembled
to
punish
the
four
men
appeared
cruel
the
familiar
faces
that
in
her
momentary
glance
she
recognized
seemed
to
her
evilly
transfigured
even
the
countenance
of
her
promised
husband
bent
eagerly
forward
towards
the
showed
tyrannous
and
bloodthirsty
her
eyes
hastily
followed
the
pointing
finger
of
her
father
and
sought
the
men
in
the
dock
two
of
them
lounged
sullen
and
inattentive
one
nervously
chewed
a
straw
or
piece
of
twig
pawing
the
dock
with
restless
hand
the
fourth
scowled
across
the
court
at
the
which
she
could
not
see
the
four
faces
were
all
strange
to
her
no
papa
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
ca
recognize
them
at
as
she
was
turning
from
the
door
a
voice
from
the
behind
her
made
her
suddenly
pale
and
pause
to
look
again
the
court
itself
appeared
at
that
moment
affected
for
a
murmur
ran
through
it
and
some
official
cried
silence
the
notorious
criminal
rufus
dawes
the
desperado
of
port
arthur
the
wild
beast
whom
the
gazette
had
judged
not
fit
to
live
had
just
entered
the
he
was
a
man
of
thirty
in
the
prime
of
life
with
a
torso
whose
muscular
grandeur
not
even
the
yellow
jacket
could
altogether
conceal
with
strong
embrowned
and
nervous
hands
an
upright
carriage
and
a
pair
of
fierce
black
eyes
that
roamed
over
the
court
hungrily
not
all
the
weight
of
the
double
irons
swaying
from
the
leathern
thong
around
his
massive
loins
could
mar
that
elegance
of
attitude
which
comes
only
from
perfect
muscular
development
not
all
the
frowning
faces
bent
upon
him
could
frown
an
accent
of
respect
into
the
contemptuous
tones
in
which
he
answered
to
his
name
rufus
dawes
prisoner
of
the
crown
come
away
my
darling
said
vickers
alarmed
at
his
blanched
face
and
eager
eyes
wait
she
said
impatiently
listening
for
the
voice
whose
owner
she
could
not
see
rufus
dawes
oh
i
have
heard
that
name
before
you
are
a
prisoner
of
the
crown
at
the
penal
settlement
of
port
arthur
for
life
for
sylvia
turned
to
her
father
with
breathless
inquiry
in
her
eyes
oh
papa
who
is
that
speaking
i
know
the
name
the
voice
that
is
the
man
who
was
with
you
in
the
boat
dear
says
vickers
gravely
the
the
eager
light
died
out
of
her
eyes
and
in
its
place
came
a
look
of
disappointment
and
pain
i
thought
it
was
a
good
man
she
said
holding
by
the
edge
of
the
doorway
it
sounded
like
a
good
and
then
she
pressed
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
shuddered
there
there
says
vickers
soothingly
do
be
afraid
poppet
he
ca
hurt
you
no
ha
ha
says
meekin
with
great
display
of
courage
the
villain
safe
enough
the
colloquy
in
the
court
went
on
do
you
know
the
prisoners
in
the
dock
who
are
they
john
rex
henry
shiers
james
lesly
and
and
i
not
sure
about
the
last
you
are
not
sure
about
the
last
man
will
you
swear
to
the
three
others
you
remember
them
well
i
was
in
the
at
macquarie
harbour
with
them
for
three
sylvia
hearing
this
hideous
reason
for
acquaintance
gave
a
low
cry
and
fell
into
her
father
arms
oh
papa
take
me
away
i
feel
as
if
i
was
going
to
remember
something
terrible
amid
the
deep
silence
that
prevailed
the
cry
of
the
poor
girl
was
distinctly
audible
in
the
court
and
all
heads
turned
to
the
door
in
the
general
wonder
no
one
noticed
the
change
that
passed
over
rufus
dawes
his
face
flushed
scarlet
great
drops
of
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
and
his
black
eyes
glared
in
the
direction
from
whence
the
sound
came
as
though
they
would
pierce
the
envious
wood
that
separated
him
from
the
woman
whose
voice
he
had
heard
maurice
frere
sprang
up
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
under
the
bench
what
this
he
said
to
vickers
almost
brutally
what
did
you
bring
her
here
for
she
is
not
wanted
i
told
you
i
considered
it
my
duty
sir
says
vickers
with
stately
rebuke
what
has
frightened
her
what
has
she
heard
what
has
she
seen
asked
frere
with
a
strangely
white
face
sylvia
sylvia
she
opened
her
eyes
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
take
me
home
papa
oh
what
thoughts
what
does
she
mean
cried
frere
looking
in
alarm
from
one
to
the
other
that
ruffian
dawes
frightened
her
said
meekin
a
gush
of
recollection
poor
child
there
there
calm
yourself
miss
vickers
he
is
quite
frightened
her
eh
yes
said
sylvia
faintly
he
frightened
me
maurice
i
need
stop
any
longer
dear
need
i
no
says
frere
the
cloud
passing
from
his
face
major
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
was
hasty
take
her
home
at
once
this
sort
of
thing
is
too
much
for
and
so
he
went
back
to
his
place
wiping
his
brow
and
breathing
hard
as
one
who
had
just
escaped
from
some
near
peril
rufus
dawes
had
remained
in
the
same
attitude
until
the
figure
of
frere
passing
through
the
doorway
roused
him
who
is
she
he
said
in
a
low
hoarse
voice
to
the
constable
behind
him
miss
vickers
said
the
man
shortly
flinging
the
information
at
him
as
one
might
fling
a
bone
to
a
dangerous
dog
miss
vickers
repeated
the
convict
still
staring
in
a
sort
of
bewildered
agony
they
told
me
she
was
dead
the
constable
sniffed
contemptuously
at
this
preposterous
conclusion
as
who
should
say
if
you
know
all
about
it
animal
why
did
you
ask
and
then
feeling
that
the
fixed
gaze
of
his
interrogator
demanded
some
reply
added
you
thort
she
was
i
no
doubt
you
did
your
best
to
make
her
so
i
the
convict
raised
both
his
hands
with
sudden
action
of
wrathful
despair
as
though
he
would
seize
the
other
despite
the
loaded
muskets
but
checking
himself
with
sudden
impulse
wheeled
round
to
the
court
your
honour
gentlemen
i
want
to
the
change
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
no
less
than
the
sudden
loudness
of
the
exclamation
made
the
faces
hitherto
bent
upon
the
door
through
which
frere
had
passed
turn
round
again
to
many
there
it
seemed
that
the
notorious
dawes
was
no
longer
in
the
box
for
in
place
of
the
upright
and
defiant
villain
who
stood
there
an
instant
back
was
a
nervous
agitated
creature
bending
forward
in
an
attitude
almost
of
supplication
one
hand
grasping
the
rail
as
though
to
save
himself
from
falling
the
other
outstretched
towards
the
bench
your
honour
there
has
been
some
dreadful
mistake
made
i
want
to
explain
about
myself
i
explained
before
when
first
i
was
sent
to
port
arthur
but
the
letters
were
never
forwarded
by
the
commandant
of
course
that
the
rule
and
i
ca
complain
i
been
sent
there
unjustly
your
honour
i
made
that
boat
your
honour
i
saved
the
major
wife
and
daughter
i
was
the
man
i
did
it
all
myself
and
my
liberty
was
sworn
away
by
a
villain
who
hated
me
i
thought
until
now
that
no
one
knew
the
truth
for
they
told
me
that
she
was
his
rapid
utterance
took
the
court
so
much
by
surprise
that
no
one
interrupted
him
i
was
sentenced
to
death
for
bolting
sir
and
they
reprieved
me
because
i
helped
them
in
the
boat
helped
them
why
i
made
it
she
will
tell
you
so
i
nursed
her
i
carried
her
in
my
arms
i
starved
myself
for
her
she
was
fond
of
me
sir
she
was
indeed
she
called
me
at
this
a
coarse
laugh
broke
out
which
was
instantly
checked
the
judge
bent
over
to
ask
does
he
mean
miss
vickers
and
in
this
interval
rufus
dawes
looking
down
into
the
court
saw
maurice
frere
staring
up
at
him
with
terror
in
his
eyes
i
see
you
captain
frere
coward
and
liar
put
him
in
the
box
gentlemen
and
make
him
tell
his
story
she
contradict
him
never
fear
oh
and
i
thought
she
was
dead
all
this
while
the
judge
had
got
his
answer
from
the
clerk
by
this
time
miss
vickers
had
been
seriously
ill
had
fainted
just
now
in
the
court
her
only
memories
of
the
convict
who
had
been
with
her
in
the
boat
were
those
of
terror
and
disgust
the
sight
of
him
just
now
had
most
seriously
affected
her
the
convict
himself
was
an
inveterate
liar
and
schemer
and
his
story
had
been
already
disproved
by
captain
the
judge
a
man
inclining
by
nature
to
humanity
but
forced
by
experience
to
receive
all
statements
of
prisoners
with
caution
said
all
he
could
say
and
the
tragedy
of
five
years
was
disposed
of
in
the
following
dialogue
judge
this
is
not
the
place
for
an
accusation
against
captain
frere
nor
the
place
to
argue
upon
your
alleged
wrongs
if
you
have
suffered
injustice
the
authorities
will
hear
your
complaint
and
redress
it
rufus
dawes
i
have
complained
your
honour
i
wrote
letter
after
letter
to
the
government
but
they
were
never
sent
then
i
heard
she
was
dead
and
they
sent
me
to
the
coal
mines
after
that
and
we
never
hear
anything
there
judge
i
ca
listen
to
you
mangles
have
you
any
more
questions
to
ask
the
witness
but
mangles
not
having
any
more
someone
called
matthew
gabbett
and
rufus
dawes
still
endeavouring
to
speak
was
clanked
away
with
amid
a
buzz
of
remark
and
surmise
the
trial
progressed
without
further
incident
sylvia
was
not
called
and
to
the
astonishment
of
many
of
his
enemies
captain
frere
went
into
the
and
generously
spoke
in
favour
of
john
rex
he
might
have
left
us
to
starve
frere
said
he
might
have
murdered
us
we
were
completely
in
his
power
the
stock
of
provisions
on
board
the
brig
was
not
a
large
one
and
i
consider
that
in
dividing
it
with
us
he
showed
great
generosity
for
one
in
his
this
piece
of
evidence
told
strongly
in
favour
of
the
prisoners
for
captain
frere
was
known
to
be
such
an
uncompromising
foe
to
all
rebellious
convicts
that
it
was
understood
that
only
the
sternest
sense
of
justice
and
truth
could
lead
him
to
speak
in
such
terms
the
defence
set
up
by
rex
moreover
was
most
ingenious
he
was
guilty
of
absconding
but
his
moderation
might
plead
an
excuse
for
that
his
only
object
was
his
freedom
and
having
gained
it
he
had
lived
honestly
for
nearly
three
years
as
he
could
prove
he
was
charged
with
piratically
seizing
the
brig
osprey
and
he
urged
that
the
brig
osprey
having
been
built
by
convicts
at
macquarie
harbour
and
never
entered
in
any
shipping
list
could
not
be
said
to
be
piratically
seized
in
the
strict
meaning
of
the
term
the
court
admitted
the
force
of
this
objection
and
influenced
doubtless
by
captain
frere
evidence
the
fact
that
five
years
had
passed
since
the
mutiny
and
that
the
two
men
most
guilty
cheshire
and
barker
had
been
executed
in
england
sentenced
rex
and
his
three
companions
to
transportation
for
life
to
the
penal
settlements
of
the
colony
chapter
maurice
frere
good
angel
at
this
happy
conclusion
to
his
labours
frere
went
down
to
comfort
the
girl
for
whose
sake
he
had
suffered
rex
to
escape
the
gallows
on
his
way
he
was
met
by
a
man
who
touched
his
hat
and
asked
to
speak
with
him
an
instant
this
man
was
past
middle
age
owned
a
red
face
and
had
in
his
gait
and
manner
that
nameless
something
that
denotes
the
seaman
well
blunt
says
frere
pausing
with
the
impatient
air
of
a
man
who
expects
to
hear
bad
news
what
is
it
now
only
to
tell
you
that
it
is
all
right
sir
says
blunt
she
come
aboard
again
this
come
aboard
again
ejaculated
frere
why
i
did
know
that
she
had
been
ashore
where
did
she
go
he
spoke
with
an
air
of
confident
authority
and
blunt
no
longer
the
bluff
tyrant
of
old
seemed
to
quail
before
him
the
trial
of
the
mutineers
of
the
malabar
had
ruined
phineas
blunt
make
what
excuses
he
might
there
was
no
concealing
the
fact
that
pine
found
him
drunk
in
his
cabin
when
he
ought
to
have
been
attending
to
his
duties
on
deck
and
the
authorities
could
not
or
would
not
pass
over
such
a
heinous
breach
of
discipline
captain
blunt
who
of
course
had
his
own
version
of
the
story
thus
deprived
of
the
honour
of
bringing
his
majesty
prisoners
to
his
majesty
colonies
of
new
south
wales
and
van
diemen
land
went
on
a
whaling
cruise
to
the
south
seas
the
influence
which
sarah
purfoy
had
acquired
over
him
had
however
irretrievably
injured
him
it
was
as
though
she
had
poisoned
his
moral
nature
by
the
influence
of
a
clever
and
wicked
woman
over
a
sensual
and
man
blunt
gradually
sank
lower
and
lower
he
became
a
drunkard
and
was
known
as
a
man
with
a
grievance
against
the
government
captain
frere
having
had
occasion
for
him
in
some
capacity
had
become
in
a
manner
his
patron
and
had
got
him
the
command
of
a
schooner
trading
from
sydney
on
getting
this
command
not
without
some
wry
faces
on
the
part
of
the
owner
resident
in
hobart
town
blunt
had
taken
the
temperance
pledge
for
the
space
of
twelve
months
and
was
a
miserable
dog
in
consequence
he
was
however
a
faithful
henchman
for
he
hoped
by
frere
means
to
get
some
government
billet
the
grand
object
of
all
colonial
sea
captains
of
that
epoch
well
sir
she
went
ashore
to
see
a
friend
says
blunt
looking
at
the
sky
and
then
at
the
earth
what
friend
the
the
prisoner
and
she
saw
him
i
suppose
yes
but
i
thought
i
better
tell
you
sir
says
blunt
of
course
quite
right
returned
the
other
you
had
better
start
at
once
it
no
use
as
you
wish
sir
i
can
sail
morning
or
this
evening
if
you
this
evening
says
frere
turning
away
as
soon
as
there
a
situation
in
sydney
i
been
looking
after
said
the
other
uneasily
if
you
could
help
me
to
what
is
it
the
command
of
one
of
the
government
vessels
well
keep
sober
then
says
frere
and
i
see
what
i
can
do
and
keep
that
woman
tongue
still
if
you
the
pair
looked
at
each
other
and
blunt
grinned
slavishly
i
do
my
take
care
you
do
returned
his
patron
leaving
him
without
further
ceremony
frere
found
vickers
in
the
garden
and
at
once
begged
him
not
to
talk
about
the
business
to
his
daughter
you
saw
how
bad
she
was
vickers
for
goodness
sake
do
make
her
ill
my
dear
sir
says
poor
vickers
i
wo
refer
to
the
subject
been
very
unwell
ever
since
nervous
and
unstrung
go
in
and
see
so
frere
went
in
and
soothed
the
excited
girl
with
real
sorrow
at
her
suffering
it
all
right
now
poppet
he
said
to
her
do
think
of
it
any
more
put
it
out
of
your
mind
it
was
foolish
of
me
maurice
i
know
but
i
could
not
help
it
the
sound
of
of
that
man
voice
seemed
to
bring
back
to
me
some
great
pity
for
something
or
someone
i
do
explain
what
i
mean
i
know
but
i
felt
that
i
was
on
the
verge
of
remembering
a
story
of
some
great
wrong
just
about
to
hear
some
dreadful
revelation
that
should
make
me
turn
from
all
the
people
whom
i
ought
most
to
love
do
you
understand
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
says
frere
with
averted
face
but
that
all
nonsense
you
of
course
returned
she
with
a
touch
of
her
old
childish
manner
of
disposing
of
questions
out
of
hand
everybody
knows
it
all
nonsense
but
then
we
do
think
such
things
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
double
that
i
have
lived
somewhere
before
and
have
had
another
life
a
what
a
romantic
girl
you
are
said
the
other
dimly
comprehending
her
meaning
how
could
you
have
a
of
course
not
really
stupid
but
in
thought
you
know
i
dream
such
strange
things
now
and
then
i
am
always
falling
down
precipices
and
into
cataracts
and
being
pushed
into
great
caverns
in
enormous
rocks
horrible
dreams
indigestion
returned
frere
you
do
take
exercise
enough
you
should
read
so
much
have
a
good
and
in
these
dreams
continued
sylvia
not
heeding
his
interruption
there
is
one
strange
thing
you
are
always
there
come
that
all
right
says
maurice
ah
but
not
kind
and
good
as
you
are
captain
bruin
but
scowling
and
threatening
and
angry
so
that
i
am
afraid
of
but
that
is
only
a
dream
yes
but
playing
with
the
button
of
his
coat
but
what
but
you
looked
just
so
in
the
court
maurice
and
i
think
what
made
me
so
my
darling
there
hush
do
cry
but
she
had
burst
into
a
passion
of
sobs
and
tears
that
shook
her
slight
figure
in
his
arms
oh
maurice
i
am
a
wicked
girl
i
do
know
my
own
mind
i
think
sometimes
i
do
love
you
as
i
ought
you
who
have
saved
me
and
nursed
there
never
mind
about
that
muttered
maurice
frere
with
a
sort
of
choking
in
his
throat
she
grew
more
composed
presently
and
said
after
a
while
lifting
her
face
tell
me
maurice
did
you
ever
in
those
days
of
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
when
you
nursed
me
as
a
little
child
in
your
arms
and
fed
me
and
starved
for
me
did
you
ever
think
we
should
be
married
i
do
know
says
maurice
why
i
think
you
must
have
thought
so
because
it
not
vanity
dear
you
would
not
else
have
been
so
kind
and
gentle
and
nonsense
poppet
he
said
with
his
eyes
resolutely
averted
no
but
you
have
been
and
i
am
very
pettish
sometimes
papa
has
spoiled
me
you
are
always
affectionate
and
those
worrying
ways
of
yours
which
i
get
angry
at
all
come
from
love
for
me
do
they
i
hope
so
said
maurice
with
an
unwonted
moisture
in
his
eyes
well
you
see
that
is
the
reason
why
i
am
angry
with
myself
for
not
loving
you
as
i
ought
i
want
you
to
like
the
things
i
like
and
to
love
the
books
and
the
music
and
the
pictures
and
the
the
world
i
love
and
i
forget
that
you
are
a
man
you
know
and
i
am
only
a
girl
and
i
forget
how
nobly
you
behaved
maurice
and
how
unselfishly
you
risked
your
life
for
mine
why
what
is
the
matter
dear
he
had
put
her
away
from
him
suddenly
and
gone
to
the
window
gazing
across
the
sloping
garden
at
the
bay
below
sleeping
in
the
soft
evening
light
the
schooner
which
had
brought
the
witnesses
from
port
arthur
lay
off
the
shore
and
the
yellow
flag
at
her
mast
fluttered
gently
in
the
cool
evening
breeze
the
sight
of
this
flag
appeared
to
anger
him
for
as
his
eyes
fell
on
it
he
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
and
turned
round
again
maurice
she
cried
i
have
wounded
you
no
no
it
is
nothing
said
he
with
the
air
of
a
man
surprised
in
a
moment
of
weakness
i
i
did
not
like
to
hear
you
talk
in
this
way
about
not
loving
oh
forgive
me
dear
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
it
is
my
silly
way
of
saying
more
than
i
mean
how
could
i
do
otherwise
than
love
you
after
all
you
have
done
some
sudden
desperate
whim
caused
him
to
exclaim
but
suppose
i
had
not
done
all
you
think
would
you
not
love
me
still
her
eyes
raised
to
his
face
with
anxious
tenderness
for
the
pain
she
had
believed
herself
to
have
inflicted
fell
at
this
speech
what
a
question
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
should
yet
but
what
is
the
use
maurice
of
supposing
i
know
you
have
done
it
and
that
is
enough
how
can
i
say
what
i
might
have
done
if
something
else
had
happened
why
you
might
not
have
loved
if
there
had
been
for
a
moment
any
sentiment
of
remorse
in
his
selfish
heart
the
hesitation
of
her
answer
went
far
to
dispel
it
to
be
sure
that
true
and
he
placed
his
arm
round
her
she
lifted
her
face
again
with
a
bright
laugh
we
are
a
pair
of
geese
supposing
how
can
we
help
what
has
past
we
have
the
future
darling
the
future
in
which
i
am
to
be
your
little
wife
and
we
are
to
love
each
other
all
our
lives
like
the
people
in
the
temptation
to
evil
had
often
come
to
maurice
frere
and
his
selfish
nature
had
succumbed
to
it
when
in
far
less
witching
shape
than
this
fair
and
innocent
child
luring
him
with
wistful
eyes
to
win
her
what
hopes
had
he
not
built
upon
her
love
what
good
resolutions
had
he
not
made
by
reason
of
the
purity
and
goodness
she
was
to
bring
to
him
as
she
said
the
past
was
beyond
recall
the
future
in
which
she
was
to
love
him
all
her
life
was
before
them
with
the
hypocrisy
of
selfishness
which
deceives
even
itself
he
laid
the
little
head
upon
his
heart
with
a
sensible
glow
of
virtue
god
bless
you
darling
you
are
my
good

consolation
rex
told
meekin
who
the
next
day
did
him
the
honour
to
visit
him
that
under
providence
he
owed
his
escape
from
death
to
the
kind
manner
in
which
captain
frere
had
spoken
of
i
hope
your
escape
will
be
a
warning
to
you
my
man
said
meekin
and
that
you
will
endeavour
to
make
the
rest
of
your
life
thus
spared
by
the
mercy
of
providence
an
atonement
for
your
early
indeed
i
will
sir
said
john
rex
who
had
taken
meekin
measure
very
accurately
and
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
condescend
to
speak
so
to
a
wretch
like
not
at
all
said
meekin
with
affability
it
is
my
duty
i
am
a
minister
of
the
ah
sir
i
wish
i
had
attended
to
the
gospel
teachings
when
i
was
younger
i
might
have
been
saved
from
all
you
might
indeed
poor
man
but
the
divine
mercy
is
infinite
quite
infinite
and
will
be
extended
to
all
of
us
to
you
as
well
as
to
this
with
the
air
of
saying
what
do
you
think
of
that
remember
the
penitent
thief
rex
the
penitent
indeed
i
do
and
read
your
bible
rex
and
pray
for
strength
to
bear
your
i
will
meekin
i
need
it
sorely
sir
physical
as
well
as
spiritual
strength
sir
for
the
government
allowance
is
sadly
i
will
speak
to
the
authorities
about
a
change
in
your
dietary
scale
returned
meekin
patronizingly
in
the
meantime
just
collect
together
in
your
mind
those
particulars
of
your
adventures
of
which
you
spoke
and
have
them
ready
for
me
when
next
i
call
such
a
remarkable
history
ought
not
to
be
thank
you
kindly
sir
i
will
sir
ah
i
little
thought
when
i
occupied
the
position
of
a
gentleman
meekin
the
cunning
scoundrel
had
been
piously
grandiloquent
concerning
his
past
career
that
i
should
be
reduced
to
this
but
it
is
only
just
the
mysterious
workings
of
providence
are
always
just
rex
returned
meekin
who
preferred
to
speak
of
the
almighty
with
vagueness
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
conscious
of
your
errors
good
good
morning
and
heaven
bless
you
sir
said
rex
with
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
for
the
benefit
of
his
yard
mates
and
so
meekin
tripped
gracefully
away
convinced
that
he
was
labouring
most
successfully
in
the
vineyard
and
that
the
convict
rex
was
really
a
superior
person
i
will
send
his
narrative
to
the
bishop
said
he
to
himself
it
will
amuse
him
there
must
be
many
strange
histories
here
if
one
could
but
find
them
as
the
thought
passed
through
his
brain
his
eye
fell
upon
the
notorious
dawes
who
while
waiting
for
the
schooner
to
take
him
back
to
port
arthur
had
been
permitted
to
amuse
himself
by
breaking
stones
the
which
meekin
was
visiting
was
long
and
low
roofed
with
iron
and
terminating
at
each
end
in
the
stone
wall
of
the
gaol
at
one
side
rose
the
cells
at
the
other
the
outer
wall
of
the
prison
from
the
outer
wall
projected
a
weatherboard
and
beneath
this
were
seated
forty
convicts
two
constables
with
loaded
carbines
walked
up
and
down
the
clear
space
in
the
middle
and
another
watched
from
a
sort
of
built
against
the
main
wall
every
a
third
constable
went
down
the
line
and
examined
the
irons
the
admirable
system
of
solitary
confinement
which
in
average
cases
produces
insanity
in
the
space
of
twelve
months
was
as
yet
unknown
in
hobart
town
and
the
forty
men
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
each
other
faces
every
day
for
six
hours
the
other
inmates
of
the
prison
were
at
work
on
the
roads
or
otherwise
bestowed
in
the
day
time
but
the
forty
were
judged
too
desperate
to
be
let
loose
they
sat
three
feet
apart
in
two
long
lines
each
man
with
a
heap
of
stones
between
his
outstretched
legs
and
cracked
the
pebbles
in
leisurely
fashion
the
double
row
of
dismal
woodpeckers
tapping
at
this
terribly
hollow
of
penal
discipline
had
a
appearance
it
seemed
so
painfully
absurd
that
forty
muscular
men
should
be
ironed
and
guarded
for
no
better
purpose
than
the
cracking
of
a
cartload
of
in
the
meantime
the
air
was
heavy
with
angry
glances
shot
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
passage
of
the
parson
was
hailed
by
a
grumbling
undertone
of
blasphemy
it
was
considered
fashionable
to
grunt
when
the
hammer
came
in
contact
with
the
stone
and
under
cover
of
this
mock
exclamation
of
fatigue
it
was
convenient
to
launch
an
oath
a
fanciful
visitor
seeing
the
irregularly
rising
hammers
along
the
line
might
have
likened
the
shed
to
the
interior
of
some
vast
piano
whose
notes
an
unseen
hand
was
erratically
fingering
rufus
dawes
was
seated
last
on
the
line
his
back
to
the
cells
his
face
to
the
gaol
wall
this
was
the
place
nearest
the
watching
constable
and
was
allotted
on
that
account
to
the
most
some
of
his
companions
envied
him
that
melancholy
distinction
well
dawes
says
meekin
measuring
with
his
eye
the
distance
between
the
prisoner
and
himself
as
one
might
measure
the
chain
of
some
ferocious
dog
how
are
you
this
morning
dawes
dawes
scowling
in
a
parenthesis
between
the
cracking
of
two
stones
was
understood
to
say
that
he
was
very
well
i
am
afraid
dawes
said
meekin
reproachfully
that
you
have
done
yourself
no
good
by
your
outburst
in
court
on
monday
i
understand
that
public
opinion
is
quite
incensed
against
dawes
slowly
arranging
one
large
fragment
of
bluestone
in
a
comfortable
basin
of
smaller
fragments
made
no
reply
i
am
afraid
you
lack
patience
dawes
you
do
not
repent
of
your
offences
against
the
law
i
the
only
answer
vouchsafed
by
the
ironed
man
if
answer
it
could
be
called
was
a
savage
blow
which
split
the
stone
into
sudden
fragments
and
made
the
clergyman
skip
a
step
backward
you
are
a
hardened
ruffian
sir
do
you
not
hear
me
speak
to
you
i
hear
you
said
dawes
picking
up
another
stone
then
listen
respectfully
sir
said
meekin
roseate
with
celestial
anger
you
have
all
day
to
break
those
yes
i
have
all
day
returned
rufus
dawes
with
a
dogged
look
upward
and
all
next
day
for
that
matter
ugh
and
again
the
hammer
descended
i
came
to
console
you
man
to
console
you
says
meekin
indignant
at
the
contempt
with
which
his
overtures
had
been
received
i
wanted
to
give
you
some
good
advice
the
annoyance
of
the
tone
seemed
to
appeal
to
whatever
vestige
of
appreciation
for
the
humorous
chains
and
degradation
had
suffered
to
linger
in
the
convict
brain
for
a
faint
smile
crossed
his
features
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
pray
go
i
was
going
to
say
my
good
fellow
that
you
have
done
yourself
a
great
deal
of
injury
by
your
accusation
of
captain
frere
and
the
use
you
made
of
miss
vickers
a
frown
as
of
pain
contracted
the
prisoner
brows
and
he
seemed
with
difficulty
to
put
a
restraint
upon
his
speech
is
there
to
be
no
inquiry
meekin
he
asked
at
length
what
i
stated
was
the
truth
the
truth
so
help
me
god
no
blasphemy
sir
said
meekin
solemnly
no
blasphemy
wretched
man
do
not
add
to
the
sin
of
lying
the
greater
sin
of
taking
the
name
of
the
lord
thy
god
in
vain
he
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
dawes
he
will
not
hold
him
guiltless
remember
no
there
is
to
be
no
are
they
not
going
to
ask
her
for
her
story
asked
dawes
with
a
pitiful
change
of
manner
they
told
me
that
she
was
to
be
asked
surely
they
will
ask
i
am
not
perhaps
at
liberty
said
meekin
placidly
unconscious
of
the
agony
of
despair
and
rage
that
made
the
voice
of
the
strong
man
before
him
quiver
to
state
the
intentions
of
the
authorities
but
i
can
tell
you
that
miss
vickers
will
not
be
asked
anything
about
you
you
are
to
go
back
to
port
arthur
on
the
and
to
remain
a
groan
burst
from
rufus
dawes
a
groan
so
full
of
torture
that
even
the
comfortable
meekin
was
thrilled
by
it
it
is
the
law
you
know
my
good
man
i
ca
help
it
he
said
you
should
break
the
law
you
curse
the
law
cries
dawes
it
a
bloody
law
it
there
i
beg
your
pardon
and
he
fell
to
cracking
his
stones
again
with
a
laugh
that
was
more
terrible
in
its
bitter
hopelessness
of
winning
attention
or
sympathy
than
any
outburst
of
passion
could
have
been
come
says
meekin
feeling
uneasily
constrained
to
bring
forth
some
of
his
platitudes
you
ca
complain
you
have
broken
the
law
and
you
must
suffer
civilized
society
says
you
do
certain
things
and
if
you
do
them
you
must
suffer
the
penalty
civilized
society
imposes
you
are
not
wanting
in
intelligence
dawes
more
the
pity
and
you
ca
deny
the
justice
of
rufus
dawes
as
if
disdaining
to
answer
in
words
cast
his
eyes
round
the
yard
with
a
glance
that
seemed
to
ask
grimly
if
civilized
society
was
progressing
quite
in
accordance
with
justice
when
its
civilization
created
such
places
as
that
and
filled
it
with
such
creatures
as
those
forty
human
beasts
doomed
to
spend
the
best
years
of
their
manhood
cracking
pebbles
in
it
you
do
deny
that
asked
the
smug
parson
do
you
dawes
it
not
my
place
to
argue
with
you
sir
said
dawes
in
a
tone
of
indifference
born
of
lengthened
suffering
so
nicely
balanced
between
contempt
and
respect
that
the
inexperienced
meekin
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
made
a
convert
or
subjected
himself
to
an
impertinence
but
i
a
prisoner
for
life
and
do
look
at
it
in
the
same
way
that
you
this
view
of
the
question
did
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
meekin
for
his
mild
cheek
flushed
certainly
the
fact
of
being
a
prisoner
for
life
did
make
some
difference
the
sound
of
the
noonday
bell
however
warned
him
to
cease
argument
and
to
take
his
consolations
out
of
the
way
of
the
mustering
prisoners
with
a
great
clanking
and
clashing
of
irons
the
forty
rose
and
stood
each
by
his
the
third
constable
came
round
rapping
the
of
each
man
with
easy
nonchalance
and
roughly
pulling
up
the
coarse
trousers
made
with
buttoned
flaps
at
the
sides
like
mexican
calzoneros
in
order
to
give
free
play
to
the
ankle
fetters
so
that
he
might
assure
himself
that
no
tricks
had
been
played
since
his
last
visit
as
each
man
passed
this
ordeal
he
saluted
and
clanked
with
legs
to
the
place
in
the
double
line
meekin
though
not
a
patron
of
field
sports
found
something
in
the
scene
that
reminded
him
of
a
blacksmith
picking
up
horses
feet
to
examine
the
soundness
of
their
shoes
upon
my
word
he
said
to
himself
with
a
momentary
pang
of
genuine
compassion
it
is
a
dreadful
way
to
treat
human
beings
i
do
wonder
at
that
wretched
creature
groaning
under
it
but
bless
me
it
is
near
one
and
i
promised
to
lunch
with
major
vickers
at
two
how
time
flies
to
be
sure
chapter
vii
rufus
dawes
idyll
that
afternoon
while
meekin
was
digesting
his
lunch
and
chatting
airily
with
sylvia
rufus
dawes
began
to
brood
over
a
desperate
scheme
the
intelligence
that
the
investigation
he
had
hoped
for
was
not
to
be
granted
to
him
had
rendered
doubly
bitter
those
galling
fetters
of
self
restraint
which
he
had
laid
upon
himself
for
five
years
of
desolation
he
had
waited
and
hoped
for
a
chance
which
might
bring
him
to
hobart
town
and
enable
him
to
denounce
the
treachery
of
maurice
frere
he
had
by
an
almost
miraculous
accident
obtained
that
chance
of
open
speech
and
having
obtained
it
he
found
that
he
was
not
allowed
to
speak
all
the
hopes
he
had
formed
were
dashed
to
earth
all
the
calmness
with
which
he
had
forced
himself
to
bear
his
fate
was
now
turned
into
bitterest
rage
and
fury
instead
of
one
enemy
he
had
twenty
all
judge
jury
gaoler
and
parson
were
banded
together
to
work
him
evil
and
deny
him
right
the
whole
world
was
his
foe
there
was
no
honesty
or
truth
in
any
living
creature
save
one
during
the
dull
misery
of
his
convict
life
at
port
arthur
one
bright
memory
shone
upon
him
like
a
star
in
the
depth
of
his
degradation
at
the
height
of
his
despair
he
cherished
one
pure
and
ennobling
thought
the
thought
of
the
child
whom
he
had
saved
and
who
loved
him
when
on
board
the
whaler
that
had
rescued
him
from
the
burning
boat
he
had
felt
that
the
sailors
believing
in
frere
bluff
lies
shrunk
from
the
moody
felon
he
had
gained
strength
to
be
silent
by
thinking
of
the
suffering
child
when
poor
vickers
died
making
no
sign
and
thus
the
chief
witness
to
his
heroism
perished
before
his
eyes
the
thought
that
the
child
was
left
had
restrained
his
selfish
regrets
when
frere
handing
him
over
to
the
authorities
as
an
absconder
ingeniously
twisted
the
details
of
the
to
his
own
glorification
the
knowledge
that
sylvia
would
assign
to
these
pretensions
their
true
value
had
given
him
courage
to
keep
silence
so
strong
was
his
belief
in
her
gratitude
that
he
scorned
to
beg
for
the
pardon
he
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
she
would
ask
for
him
so
utter
was
his
contempt
for
the
coward
and
boaster
who
dressed
in
brief
authority
bore
insidious
false
witness
against
him
that
when
he
heard
his
sentence
of
life
banishment
he
disdained
to
make
known
the
true
part
he
had
played
in
the
matter
preferring
to
wait
for
the
more
exquisite
revenge
the
more
complete
justification
which
would
follow
upon
the
recovery
of
the
child
from
her
illness
but
when
at
port
arthur
day
after
day
passed
over
and
brought
no
word
of
pity
or
justification
he
began
with
a
sickening
feeling
of
despair
to
comprehend
that
something
strange
had
happened
he
was
told
by
newcomers
that
the
child
of
the
commandant
lay
still
and
near
to
death
then
he
heard
that
she
and
her
father
had
left
the
colony
and
that
all
prospect
of
her
righting
him
by
her
evidence
was
at
an
end
this
news
gave
him
a
terrible
pang
and
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
break
out
into
upbraidings
of
her
selfishness
but
with
that
depth
of
love
which
was
in
him
albeit
crusted
over
and
concealed
by
the
sullenness
of
speech
and
manner
which
his
sufferings
had
produced
he
found
excuses
for
her
even
then
she
was
she
was
in
the
hands
of
friends
who
loved
her
and
disregarded
him
perhaps
even
her
entreaties
and
explanations
were
put
aside
as
childish
babblings
she
would
free
him
if
she
had
the
power
then
he
wrote
statements
agonized
to
see
the
commandant
pestered
the
gaolers
and
warders
with
the
story
of
his
wrongs
and
inundated
the
government
with
letters
which
containing
as
they
did
always
denunciations
of
maurice
frere
were
never
suffered
to
reach
their
destination
the
authorities
willing
at
the
first
to
look
kindly
upon
him
in
consideration
of
his
strange
experience
grew
weary
of
this
perpetual
iteration
of
what
they
believed
to
be
malicious
falsehoods
and
ordered
him
heavier
tasks
and
more
continuous
labour
they
mistook
his
gloom
for
treachery
his
impatient
outbursts
of
passion
at
his
fate
for
ferocity
his
silent
endurance
for
dangerous
cunning
as
he
had
been
at
macquarie
harbour
so
did
he
become
at
port
arthur
a
marked
man
despairing
of
winning
his
coveted
liberty
by
fair
means
and
horrified
at
the
hideous
prospect
of
a
life
in
chains
he
twice
attempted
to
escape
but
escape
was
even
more
hopeless
than
it
had
been
at
hell
gates
the
peninsula
of
port
arthur
was
admirably
guarded
signal
stations
drew
a
chain
round
the
prison
an
armed
boat
crew
watched
each
bay
and
across
the
narrow
isthmus
which
connected
it
with
the
mainland
was
a
cordon
of
in
addition
to
the
soldier
guard
he
was
retaken
of
course
flogged
and
weighted
with
heavier
irons
the
second
time
they
sent
him
to
the
coal
mines
where
the
prisoners
lived
underground
worked
and
dragged
their
inspecting
gaolers
in
wagons
upon
iron
tramways
when
such
great
people
condescended
to
visit
them
the
day
on
which
he
started
for
this
place
he
heard
that
sylvia
was
dead
and
his
last
hope
went
from
him
then
began
with
him
a
new
religion
he
worshipped
the
dead
for
the
living
he
had
but
hatred
and
evil
words
for
the
dead
he
had
love
and
tender
thoughts
instead
of
the
phantoms
of
his
vanished
youth
which
were
wont
to
visit
him
he
saw
now
but
one
vision
the
vision
of
the
child
who
had
loved
him
instead
of
conjuring
up
for
himself
pictures
of
that
home
circle
in
which
he
had
once
moved
and
those
creatures
who
in
the
past
years
had
thought
him
worthy
of
esteem
and
affection
he
placed
before
himself
but
one
idea
one
embodiment
of
happiness
one
being
who
was
without
sin
and
without
stain
among
all
the
monsters
of
that
pit
into
which
he
had
fallen
around
the
figure
of
the
innocent
child
who
had
lain
in
his
breast
and
laughed
at
him
with
her
red
young
mouth
he
grouped
every
image
of
happiness
and
love
having
banished
from
his
thoughts
all
hope
of
resuming
his
name
and
place
he
pictured
to
himself
some
quiet
nook
at
the
world
end
a
house
in
a
german
country
town
or
remote
cottage
by
the
english
seashore
where
he
and
his
might
have
lived
together
happier
in
a
purer
affection
than
the
love
of
man
for
woman
he
bethought
him
how
he
could
have
taught
her
out
of
the
strange
store
of
learning
which
his
roving
life
had
won
for
him
how
he
could
have
confided
to
her
his
real
name
and
perhaps
purchased
for
her
wealth
and
honour
by
reason
of
it
yet
he
thought
she
would
not
care
for
wealth
and
honour
she
would
prefer
a
quiet
life
a
life
of
unassuming
usefulness
a
life
devoted
to
good
deeds
to
charity
and
love
he
could
see
her
in
his
visions
reading
by
a
cheery
fireside
wandering
in
summer
woods
or
lingering
by
the
marge
of
the
slumbering
sea
he
could
feel
in
his
dreams
her
soft
arms
about
his
neck
her
innocent
kisses
on
his
lips
he
could
hear
her
light
laugh
and
see
her
sunny
ringlets
float
as
she
ran
to
meet
him
conscious
that
she
was
dead
and
that
he
did
to
her
gentle
memory
no
disrespect
by
linking
her
fortunes
to
those
of
a
wretch
who
had
seen
so
much
of
evil
as
himself
he
loved
to
think
of
her
as
still
living
and
to
plot
out
for
her
and
for
himself
impossible
plans
for
future
happiness
in
the
noisome
darkness
of
the
mine
in
the
glaring
light
of
the
noonday
dragging
at
his
loaded
wagon
he
could
see
her
ever
with
him
her
calm
eyes
gazing
lovingly
on
his
as
they
had
gazed
in
the
boat
so
long
ago
she
never
seemed
to
grow
older
she
never
seemed
to
wish
to
leave
him
it
was
only
when
his
misery
became
too
great
for
him
to
bear
and
he
cursed
and
blasphemed
mingling
for
a
time
in
the
hideous
mirth
of
his
companions
that
the
little
figure
fled
away
thus
dreaming
he
had
shaped
out
for
himself
a
sorrowful
comfort
and
in
his
found
a
compensation
for
the
terrible
affliction
of
living
indifference
to
his
present
sufferings
took
possession
of
him
only
at
the
bottom
of
this
indifference
lurked
a
fixed
hatred
of
the
man
who
had
brought
these
sufferings
upon
him
and
a
determination
to
demand
at
the
first
opportunity
a
reconsideration
of
that
claims
to
be
esteemed
a
hero
it
was
in
this
mood
that
he
had
intended
to
make
the
revelation
which
he
had
made
in
court
but
the
intelligence
that
sylvia
lived
unmanned
him
and
his
prepared
speech
had
been
usurped
by
a
passionate
torrent
of
complaint
and
invective
which
convinced
no
one
and
gave
frere
the
very
argument
he
needed
it
was
decided
that
the
prisoner
dawes
was
a
malicious
and
artful
scoundrel
whose
only
object
was
to
gain
a
brief
respite
of
the
punishment
which
he
had
so
justly
earned
against
this
injustice
he
had
resolved
to
rebel
it
was
monstrous
he
thought
that
they
should
refuse
to
hear
the
witness
who
was
so
ready
to
speak
in
his
favour
infamous
that
they
should
send
him
back
to
his
doom
without
allowing
her
to
say
a
word
in
his
defence
but
he
would
defeat
that
scheme
he
had
planned
a
method
of
escape
and
he
would
break
from
his
bonds
fling
himself
at
her
feet
and
pray
her
to
speak
the
truth
for
him
and
so
save
him
strong
in
his
faith
in
her
and
with
his
love
for
her
brightened
by
the
love
he
had
borne
to
her
he
felt
sure
of
her
power
to
rescue
him
now
as
he
had
rescued
her
before
if
she
knew
i
was
alive
she
would
come
to
me
he
said
i
am
sure
she
would
perhaps
they
told
her
that
i
was
meditating
that
night
in
the
solitude
of
his
cell
his
evil
character
had
gained
him
the
poor
luxury
of
loneliness
he
almost
wept
to
think
of
the
cruel
deception
that
had
doubtless
been
practised
on
her
they
have
told
her
that
i
was
dead
in
order
that
she
might
learn
to
forget
me
but
she
could
not
do
that
i
have
thought
of
her
so
often
during
these
weary
years
that
she
must
sometimes
have
thought
of
me
five
years
she
must
be
a
woman
now
my
little
child
a
woman
yet
she
is
sure
to
be
childlike
sweet
and
gentle
how
she
will
grieve
when
she
hears
of
my
sufferings
oh
my
darling
my
darling
you
are
not
dead
and
then
looking
hastily
about
him
in
the
darkness
as
though
fearful
even
there
of
being
seen
he
pulled
from
out
his
breast
a
little
packet
and
felt
it
lovingly
with
his
coarse
fingers
reverently
raising
it
to
his
lips
and
dreaming
over
it
with
a
smile
on
his
face
as
though
it
were
a
sacred
talisman
that
should
open
to
him
the
doors
of
freedom
chapter
viii
an
escape
a
few
days
after
this
on
the
of
december
maurice
frere
was
alarmed
by
a
piece
of
startling
intelligence
the
notorious
dawes
had
escaped
from
gaol
captain
frere
had
inspected
the
prison
that
very
afternoon
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
the
hammers
had
never
fallen
so
briskly
nor
the
chains
clanked
so
gaily
as
on
the
occasion
of
his
visit
thinking
of
their
christmas
holiday
the
dogs
he
had
said
to
the
patrolling
warder
thinking
about
their
christmas
pudding
the
luxurious
scoundrels
and
the
convict
nearest
him
had
laughed
appreciatively
as
convicts
and
schoolboys
do
laugh
at
the
jests
of
the
man
in
authority
all
seemed
contentment
moreover
he
had
by
way
of
a
pleasant
stroke
of
wit
tormented
rufus
dawes
with
his
the
schooner
sails
my
man
he
had
said
you
spend
your
christmas
at
the
and
congratulated
himself
upon
the
fact
that
rufus
dawes
merely
touched
his
cap
and
went
on
with
his
in
silence
certainly
double
irons
and
hard
labour
were
fine
things
to
break
a
spirit
so
that
when
in
the
afternoon
of
that
same
day
he
heard
the
astounding
news
that
rufus
dawes
had
freed
himself
from
his
fetters
climbed
the
gaol
wall
in
broad
daylight
run
the
gauntlet
of
macquarie
street
and
was
now
supposed
to
be
safely
hidden
in
the
mountains
he
was
dumbfounded
how
the
deuce
did
he
do
it
jenkins
he
asked
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
yard
well
i
blessed
if
i
rightly
know
your
honour
says
jenkins
he
was
over
the
wall
before
you
could
say
scott
fired
and
missed
him
and
then
i
heard
the
sentry
musket
but
he
missed
him
missed
him
cries
frere
pretty
fellows
you
are
all
of
you
i
suppose
you
could
hit
a
haystack
at
twenty
yards
why
the
man
three
feet
from
the
end
of
your
carbine
the
unlucky
scott
standing
in
melancholy
attitude
by
the
empty
irons
muttered
something
about
the
sun
having
been
in
his
eyes
i
do
know
how
it
was
sir
i
ought
to
have
hit
him
for
certain
i
think
i
did
touch
him
too
as
he
went
up
the
a
stranger
to
the
customs
of
the
place
might
have
imagined
that
he
was
listening
to
a
conversation
about
a
pigeon
match
tell
me
all
about
it
says
frere
with
an
angry
curse
i
was
just
turning
your
honour
when
i
hears
scott
sing
out
and
when
i
turned
round
i
saw
dawes
irons
on
the
ground
and
him
up
the
heap
o
stones
yonder
the
two
men
on
my
right
jumped
up
and
i
thought
it
was
a
thing
among
so
i
covered
with
my
carbine
according
to
instructions
and
called
out
that
i
shoot
the
first
that
stepped
out
then
i
heard
scott
piece
and
the
men
gave
a
shout
like
when
i
looked
round
he
was
nobody
else
moved
no
sir
i
was
confused
at
first
and
thought
they
were
all
in
it
but
parton
and
haines
they
runs
in
and
gets
between
me
and
the
wall
and
then
short
he
come
and
we
examined
their
all
right
all
right
your
honour
and
they
all
swore
they
knowed
nothing
of
it
i
know
dawes
irons
was
all
right
when
he
went
to
frere
stopped
and
examined
the
empty
fetters
all
right
be
hanged
he
said
if
you
do
know
your
duty
better
than
this
the
sooner
you
go
somewhere
else
the
better
my
man
look
here
the
two
ankle
fetters
were
severed
one
had
been
evidently
filed
through
and
the
other
broken
transversely
the
latter
was
bent
as
from
a
violent
blow
do
know
where
he
got
the
file
from
said
warder
short
know
of
course
you
do
know
you
men
never
do
know
anything
until
the
mischief
done
you
want
me
here
for
a
month
or
so
i
teach
you
your
duty
do
know
with
things
like
this
lying
about
i
wonder
the
whole
yard
is
loose
and
dining
with
the
this
was
a
fragment
of
delft
pottery
which
frere
quick
eye
had
detected
among
the
broken
metal
i
cut
the
biggest
iron
you
got
with
this
and
so
would
he
and
plenty
more
i
go
bail
you

to
have
lived
with
me
at
sarah
island
short
do
know
well
captain
frere
it

accident
says
short
and
ca
be
helped
an
accident
roared
frere
what
business
have
you
with
accidents
how
in
the
devil
name
you
let
the
man
get
over
the
wall
i
he
ran
up
that
stone
heap
says
scott
and
seemed
to
me
to
jump
at
the
roof
of
the
shed
i
fired
at
him
and
he
swung
his
legs
over
the
top
of
the
wall
and
frere
measured
the
distance
from
his
eye
and
an
irrepressible
feeling
of
admiration
rising
out
of
his
own
skill
in
athletics
took
possession
of
him
for
an
instant
by
the
lord
harry
but
it
a
big
jump
he
said
and
then
the
instinctive
fear
with
which
the
consciousness
of
the
hideous
wrong
he
had
done
the
now
escaped
convict
inspired
him
made
him
add
a
desperate
villain
like
that
would
stick
at
a
murder
if
you
pressed
him
hard
which
way
did
he
go
right
up
macquarie
street
and
then
made
for
the
mountain
there
were
few
people
about
but
mays
of
the
star
hotel
tried
to
stop
him
and
was
knocked
head
over
heels
he
says
the
fellow
runs
like
a
we
have
the
reward
out
if
we
do
get
him
says
frere
turning
away
and
you
better
put
on
an
extra
warder
this
sort
of
game
is
and
he
strode
away
to
the
barracks
from
right
to
left
from
east
to
west
through
the
prison
city
flew
the
signal
of
alarm
and
the
patrol
clattering
out
along
the
road
to
new
norfolk
made
hot
haste
to
strike
the
trail
of
the
fugitive
but
night
came
and
found
him
yet
at
large
and
the
patrol
returning
weary
and
disheartened
protested
that
he
must
be
lying
hid
in
some
gorge
of
the
purple
mountain
that
overshadowed
the
town
and
would
have
to
be
starved
into
submission
meanwhile
the
usual
message
ran
through
the
island
and
so
admirable
were
the
arrangements
which
arthur
the
reformer
had
initiated
that
before
noon
of
the
next
day
not
a
signal
station
on
the
coast
but
knew
that
no
prisoner
for
life
was
illegally
at
large
this
intelligence
further
aided
by
a
paragraph
in
the
gazette
anent
the
daring
escape
noised
abroad
the
world
cared
little
that
the
mary
jane
government
schooner
had
sailed
for
port
arthur
without
rufus
dawes
but
two
or
three
persons
cared
a
good
deal
major
vickers
for
one
was
indignant
that
his
boasted
security
of
bolts
and
bars
should
have
been
so
easily
defied
and
in
proportion
to
his
indignation
was
the
grief
of
messieurs
jenkins
scott
and
suspended
from
office
and
threatened
with
absolute
dismissal
meekin
was
terribly
frightened
at
the
fact
that
so
dangerous
a
monster
should
be
roaming
at
large
within
reach
of
his
own
saintly
person
sylvia
had
shown
symptoms
of
nervous
terror
none
the
less
injurious
because
carefully
repressed
and
captain
maurice
frere
was
a
prey
to
the
most
cruel
anxiety
he
had
ridden
off
at
a
within
ten
minutes
after
he
had
reached
the
barracks
and
had
spent
the
few
hours
of
remaining
daylight
in
scouring
the
country
along
the
road
to
the
north
at
dawn
the
next
day
he
was
away
to

with
a
at
his
heels
explored
as
much
of
that
wilderness
of
gully
and
chasm
as
nature
permitted
to
him
he
had
offered
to
double
the
reward
and
had
examined
a
number
of
suspicious
persons
it
was
known
that
he
had
been
inspecting
the
prison
a
few
hours
before
the
escape
took
place
and
his
efforts
were
therefore
attributed
to
zeal
not
unmixed
with
chagrin
our
dear
friend
feels
his
reputation
at
stake
the
future
chaplain
of
port
arthur
said
to
sylvia
at
the
christmas
dinner
he
is
so
proud
of
his
knowledge
of
these
unhappy
men
that
he
dislikes
to
be
outwitted
by
any
of
notwithstanding
all
this
however
dawes
had
disappeared
the
fat
landlord
of
the
star
hotel
was
the
last
person
who
saw
him
and
the
flying
yellow
figure
seemed
to
have
been
as
completely
swallowed
up
by
the
warm
summer
afternoon
as
if
it
had
run
headlong
into
the
blackest
night
that
ever
hung
above

chapter
ix

letter
home
the
little
gathering
of
which
major
vickers
had
spoken
to
meekin
had
grown
into
something
larger
than
he
had
anticipated
instead
of
a
quiet
dinner
at
which
his
own
household
his
daughter
betrothed
and
the
stranger
clergyman
only
should
be
present
the
major
found
himself
entangled
with
mesdames
protherick
and
jellicoe
mcnab
of
the
garrison
and
pounce
of
the
civil
list
his
quiet
christmas
dinner
had
grown
into
an
evening
party
the
conversation
was
on
the
usual
topic
heard
anything
about
that
fellow
dawes
asked
pounce
not
yet
says
frere
sulkily
but
he
wo
be
out
long
i
got
a
dozen
men
up
the
i
suppose
it
is
not
easy
for
a
prisoner
to
make
good
his
escape
says
meekin
oh
he
need
be
caught
says
frere
if
that
what
you
mean
but
he
starve
instead
the
bushranging
days
are
over
now
and
it
a
precious
poor
for
any
man
to
live
upon
luck
in
the
indeed
yes
says
pounce
lapping
his
soup
this
island
seems
specially
adapted
by
providence
for
a
convict
settlement
for
with
an
admirable
climate
it
carries
little
indigenous
vegetation
which
will
support

he
created
the
cauleny
o
van
neither
do
i
said
sylvia
i
do
know
says
protherick
poor
protherick
used
often
to
say
that
it
seemed
as
if
some
almighty
hand
had
planned
the
penal
settlements
round
the
coast
the
country
is
so
delightfully
ay
port
arthur
could
have
been
better
if
it
had
been
made
on
purpose
says
frere
and
all
up
the
coast
from
tenby
to
there
is
a
scrap
for
human
being
to
make
a
meal
on
the
west
coast
is
worse
by
george
sir
in
the
old
days
i
remember
by
the
way
says
meekin
i
got
something
to
show
you
confession
i
brought
it
down
on
rex
confession
his
account
of
his
adventures
after
he
left
macquarie
harbour
i
am
going
to
send
it
to
the
oh
i
should
like
to
see
it
said
sylvia
with
heightened
colour
the
story
of
these
unhappy
men
has
a
personal
interest
for
a
forbidden
subject
no
papa
not
altogether
forbidden
for
it
does
not
affect
me
now
as
it
used
to
do
you
must
let
me
read
it
a
pack
of
lies
i
expect
said
frere
with
a
scowl
that
scoundrel
rex
could
tell
the
truth
to
save
his
you
misjudge
him
captain
frere
said
meekin
all
the
prisoners
are
not
hardened
in
iniquity
like
rufus
dawes
rex
is
i
believe
truly
penitent
and
has
written
a
most
touching
letter
to
his
a
letter
said
vickers
you
know
that
by
the
king
no
the
queen
regulations
no
letters
are
allowed
to
be
sent
to
the
friends
of
prisoners
without
first
passing
through
the
hands
of
the
i
am
aware
of
that
major
and
for
that
reason
have
brought
it
with
me
that
you
may
read
it
for
yourself
it
seems
to
me
to
breathe
a
spirit
of
true
let
have
a
look
at
it
said
frere
here
it
is
returned
meekin
producing
a
packet
and
when
the
cloth
is
removed
i
will
ask
permission
of
the
ladies
to
read
it
aloud
it
is
most
a
glance
of
surprise
passed
between
the
ladies
protherick
and
jellicoe
the
idea
of
a
convict
letter
proving
interesting
meekin
was
new
to
the
ways
of
the
place
frere
turning
the
packet
between
his
finger
read
the
address

of

his

always
the
worst

never
had
a
task
so
painful
to
my
mangled
feelings
as
the
present
one
of
addressing
you
from
this
doleful
spot
my
prison
on
the
beach
of
which
i
stand
a
monument
of
destruction
driven
by
the
adverse
winds
of
fate
to
the
confines
of
black
despair
and
into
the
vortex
of
galling
misery

just
like
a
gigantic
tree
of
the

a

but
now

i

with
the

my

circumstances
and
pictures
you
will
find
well
and
truly
drawn
in
the
psalm

my

request
you

blasphemous
dog
said
vickers
you
do
believe
all
that
meekin
do
you
the
parson
reproved
him
gently
wait
a
moment
sir
until
i
have
spirit
runs
very
high
even
in
prison
in
van
diemen
land
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
a
licentious
press
invariably
evinces
a
very
great
degree
of
contumely
while
the
authorities
are
held
in
respect
by
all
persons
though
it
is
often
endeavoured
by
some
to
bring
on
them
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
prisoners
but
i
am
glad
to
tell
you
that
all
their
efforts
are
without
avail
but
nevertheless
do
not
read
in
any
colonial
newspaper
there
is
so
much
scurrility
and
vituperation
in
their
productions
that
for
your
benefit
frere
said
vickers
with
a
smile
you
remember
what
was
said
about
your
presence
at
the
race
meetings
of
course
said
frere
artful
scoundrel
go
on
meekin
am
aware
that
you
will
hear
accounts
of
cruelty
and
tyranny
said
by
the
malicious
and
the
haters
of
the
government
and
government
officials
to
have
been
inflicted
by
gaolers
on
convicts
to
be
candid
this
is
not
the
dreadful
place
it
has
been
represented
to
be
by
vindictive
writers
severe
flogging
and
heavy
chaining
is
sometimes
used
no
doubt
but
only
in
rare
cases
and
nominal
punishments
are
marked
out
by
law
for
slight
breaches
of
discipline
so
far
as
i
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
the
lash
is
never
bestowed
unless
merited
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
i
do
doubt
it
said
frere
cracking
a
walnut
texts
of
scripture
quoted
by
our
chaplain
have
comforted
me
much
and
i
have
much
to
be
grateful
for
for
after
the
rash
attempt
i
made
to
secure
my
freedom
i
have
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
mercy
shown
to
me
death
dreadful
death
of
soul
and
body
would
have
been
my
portion
but
by
the
mercy
of
omnipotence
i
have
been
spared
to
repentance
john

i
have
now
come
to
bitterness
the
chaplain
a
pious
gentleman
says
it
never
really
pays
to
steal
lay
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
honesty
is
the
best
policy
i
am
convinced
and
i
would
not
for
repeat
my
evil
courses
psalm
xxxviii
when
i
think
of
the
happy
days
i
once
passed
with
good
blicks
in
the
old
house
in
blue
anchor
yard
and
reflect
that
since
that
happy
time
i
have
recklessly
plunged
in
sin
and
stolen
goods
and
watches
studs
rings
and
jewellery
become
indeed
a
common
thief

tremble
with
remorse
and
fly
to

oh
what
sinners
we
are

me
hope
that
now

by

placed
beyond
temptation
will
live
safely
and
that
some
day
i
even
may
by
the
will
of
the
lord
jesus
find
mercy
for
my
sins
some
kind
of
madness
has
method
in
it
but
madness
of
sin
holds
us
without
escape
such
is
dear
father
then
my
hope
and
trust
for
my
remaining
life
here
psalm
c
i
owe
my
bodily
to
captain
maurice
frere
who
was
good
enough
to
speak
of
my
conduct
in
reference
to
the
osprey
when
with
shiers
barker
and
others
we
captured
that
vessel
pray
for
captain
frere
my
dear
father
he
is
a
good
man
and
though
his
public
duty
is
painful
and
trying
to
his
feelings
yet
as
a
public
functionary
he
could
not
allow
his
private
feelings
whether
of
mercy
or
revenge
to
step
between
him
and
his
duty
confound
the
rascal
said
frere
growing
crimson
me
most
affectionately
to
sarah
and
little
william
and
all
friends
who
yet
cherish
the
recollection
of
me
and
bid
them
take
warning
by
my
fate
and
keep
from
evil
courses
a
good
conscience
is
better
than
gold
and
no
amount
can
compensate
for
the
misery
incident
to
a
return
to
crime
whether
i
shall
ever
see
you
again
dear
father
is
more
than
uncertain
for
my
doom
is
life
unless
the
government
alter
their
plans
concerning
me
and
allow
me
an
opportunity
to
earn
my
freedom
by
hard
work
blessing
of
god
rest
with
you
my
dear
father
and
that
you
may
be
washed
white
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
is
the
prayer
of
your
son
john
rex
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
whiter
than
snow
is
that
all
said
frere
that
is
all
sir
and
a
very
touching
letter
it
so
it
is
said
frere
now
let
me
have
it
a
moment
he
took
the
paper
and
referring
to
the
numbers
of
the
texts
which
he
had
written
in
his
began
to
knit
his
brows
over
john
rex
impious
and
hypocritical
production
i
thought
so
he
said
at
length
those
texts
were
never
written
for
nothing
it
an
old
trick
but
cleverly
what
do
you
mean
said
meekin
mean
cries
frere
with
a
smile
at
his
own
acuteness
this
precious
composition
contains
a
very
gratifying
piece
of
intelligence
for
blicks
whoever
he
is
some
receiver
no
doubt
look
here
meekin
take
the
letter
and
this
pencil
and
begin
at
the
first
text
the
psalm
from
the
verse
to
the
inclusive
does
he
say
very
good
that
nine
verses
it
well
now
underscore
nine
consecutive
words
from
the
second
word
immediately
following
the
next
text
quoted
have
hope
etc
have
you
got
it
yes
says
meekin
astonished
while
all
heads
bent
over
the
table
well
now
his
text
is
the
eighteenth
verse
of
the
psalm
is
it
count
eighteen
words
on
then
underscore
five
consecutive
ones
you
done
that
a
moment
sixteen
seventeen
eighteen
count
and
score
in
the
same
way
until
you
come
to
the
word
somewhere
vickers
i
trouble
you
for
the
yes
said
meekin
after
a
pause
here
it
is
texts
of
scripture
quoted
by
our
chaplain
but
surely
frere
hold
on
a
bit
now
cries
frere
what
the
next
quotation
john
iii
that
every
third
word
score
every
third
word
beginning
with
immediately
following
the
text
now
until
you
come
to
a
quotation
got
it
how
many
words
in
it
up
for
yourselves
treasures
in
heaven
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
doth
corrupt
said
meekin
a
little
scandalized
fourteen
count
fourteen
words
on
then
and
score
the
fourteenth
i
up
to
this
the
word
said
meekin
then
there
another
text

psalm
and
the
fourteenth
verse
do
that
the
same
way
as
the
other
count
fourteen
words
and
then
score
eight
in
succession
where
does
that
bring
you

fifth
every
fifth
word
then
go
on
my
dear
sir
go
on
of
yes
the
hundredth
psalm
means
a
full
stop
what
verse
count
words
and
there
was
a
pause
for
a
few
minutes
while
meekin
counted
the
letter
had
really
turned
out
interesting
read
out
your
marked
words
now
meekin
let
see
if
i
meekin
read
with
gradually
crimsoning
face
have
hope
even
in
this
my
desolate
condition
in
prison
van
diemen
land
the
authorities
are
held
in
hatred
and
contempt
of
prisoners
read
in
any
colonial
newspaper
accounts
of
cruelty
and
tyranny
inflicted
by
gaolers
on
convicts
severe
flogging
and
heavy
chaining
for
slight
breaches

i
come
the
pious
it
pays
in
the
old
house
in
blue
anchor
yard
stolen
goods
and
watches
studs
rings
and
jewellery
are
now
placed
safely
i
will
find
some
method
of
escape
then
for
revenge
well
said
maurice
looking
round
with
a
grin
what
do
you
think
of
that
most
remarkable
said
pounce
how
did
you
find
it
out
frere
oh
it
nothing
says
frere
meaning
that
it
was
a
great
deal
studied
a
good
many
of
these
things
and
this
one
is
clumsy
to
some
seen
but
it
pious
is
it
meekin
meekin
arose
in
wrath
it
very
ungracious
on
your
part
captain
frere
a
capital
joke
i
have
no
doubt
but
permit
me
to
say
i
do
not
like
jesting
on
such
matters
this
poor
fellow
letter
to
his
aged
father
to
be
made
the
subject
of
heartless
merriment
i
confess
i
do
not
understand
it
was
confided
to
me
in
my
sacred
character
as
a
christian
that
just
it
the
fellows
play
upon
the
parsons
do
you
know
and
under
cover
of
your
character
play
all
kinds
of
pranks
how
the
dog
must
have
chuckled
when
he
gave
you
that
captain
frere
said
meekin
changing
colour
like
a
chameleon
with
indignation
and
rage
your
interpretation
is
i
am
convinced
an
incorrect
one
how
could
the
poor
man
compose
such
an
ingenious
piece
of
cryptography
if
you
mean
fake
up
that
paper
returned
frere
unconsciously
dropping
into
prison
slang
i
tell
you
he
had
a
bible
i
suppose
while
he
was
writing
i
certainly
permitted
him
the
use
of
the
sacred
volume
captain
frere
i
should
have
judged
it

with
the

have
refused

my
dear
maurice
i
beg
your
pardon
meekin
says
maurice
with
clumsy
apology
but
i
know
these
fellows
i
lived
among
i
came
out
in
a
ship
with
i
talked
with
and
drank
with
and
i
down
to
all
their
moves
do
you
see
the
bible
is
the
only
book
they
get
hold
of
and
texts
are
the
only
bits
of
learning
ever
taught
and
being
chockfull
of
villainy
and
plots
and
conspiracies
what
other
book
should
they
make
use
of
to
aid
their
infernal
schemes
but
the
one
that
the
chaplain
has
made
a
text
book
for
and
maurice
rose
in
disgust
not
unmixed
with
dear
me
it
is
really
very
terrible
says
meekin
who
was
not
but
only
very
terrible
but
unhappily
true

so
what
seemed

to

upon

was
stifled
judiciously
at

sylvia
prompted
perhaps
by
curiosity
perhaps
by
a
desire
to
modify
the
chagrin
in
passing

up
the

that
lay

help
yourself
i
am
sorry
the
letter
turned
out
so
strangely
but
you
may
rely
on
frere
i
assure
you
he
knows
more
about
convicts
than
any
man
on
the
i
see
captain
frere
that
you
have
studied
the
criminal
so
i
have
my
dear
sir
and
know
every
turn
and
twist
among
i
tell
you
my
maxim
it
some
french
fellow
too
i
believe
but
that
matter
divide

conquer
set
all
the
dogs
spying
on

oh
said
meekin
it
the
only
way
why
my
dear
sir
if
the
prisoners
were
as
faithful
to
each
other
as
we
are
we
could
hold
the
island
a
week
it
just
because
no
man
can
trust
his
neighbour
that
every
mutiny
falls
to
the
i
suppose
it
must
be
so
said
poor
meekin
it
is
so
and
by
george
sir
if
i
had
my
way
i
have
it
so
that
no
prisoner
should
say
a
word
to
his
right
hand
man
but
his
left
hand
man
should
tell
me
of
it
i
promote
the
men
that
peached
and
make
the
beggars
their
own
warders
ha
ha
but
such
a
course
captain
frere
though
perhaps
useful
in
a
certain
way
would
surely
produce
harm
it
would
excite
the
worst
passions
of
our
fallen
nature
and
lead
to
endless
lying
and
tyranny
i
sure
it
wait
a
bit
cries
frere
perhaps
one
of
these
days
i
get
a
chance
and
then
i
try

there
only

when
they

chapter
x
what
became
of
the
mutineers
of
the
osprey
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
luxuriant
was
a
rustic
seat
abutting
upon
the
low
wall
that
topped
the
lane
the
branches
of
the
english
trees
planted
long
ago
hung
above
it
and
between
their
rustling
boughs
one
could
see
the
reach
of
the
silver
river
sitting
with
her
face
to
the
bay
and
her
back
to
the
house
sylvia
opened
the
manuscript
she
had
carried
off
from
meekin
and
began
to
read
it
was
written
in
a
firm
large
hand
and
headed
a
narrative
of
the
sufferings
and
adventures
of
certain
of
the
ten
convicts
who
seized
the
brig
osprey
at
macquarie
harbour
in
van
diemen
land
related
by
one
of
the
said
convicts
while
lying
under
sentence
for
this
offence
in
the
gaol
at
hobart
sylvia
having
read
this
grandiloquent
sentence
paused
for
a
moment
the
story
of
the
mutiny
which
had
been
the
chief
event
of
her
childhood
lay
before
her
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
were
it
related
truly
she
would
comprehend
something
strange
and
terrible
which
had
been
for
many
years
a
shadow
upon
her
memory
longing
and
yet
fearing
to
proceed
she
held
the
paper
half
unfolded
in
her
hand
as
in
her
childhood
she
had
held
ajar
the
door
of
some
dark
room
into
which
she
longed
and
yet
feared
to
enter
her
timidity
lasted
but
an
instant
when
orders
arrived
from
to
break
up
the
penal
settlement
of
macquarie
harbour
the
commandant
major
vickers
th
regiment
and
most
of
the
prisoners
embarked
on
board
a
colonial
vessel
and
set
sail
for
hobart
town
leaving
behind
them
a
brig
that
had
been
built
at
macquarie
harbour
to
be
brought
round
after
them
and
placing
captain
maurice
frere
in
command
left
aboard
her
was
bates
who
had
acted
as
pilot
at
the
settlement
also
four
soldiers
and
ten
prisoners
as
a
crew
to
work
the
vessel
the
commandant
wife
and
child
were
also
how
strangely
it
reads
thought
the
girl
on
the
of
january
we
set
sail
and
in
the
afternoon
anchored
safely
outside
the
gates
but
a
breeze
setting
in
from
the
caused
a
swell
on
the
bar
and
bates
ran
back
to
wellington
bay
we
remained
there
all
next
day
and
in
the
afternoon
captain
frere
took
two
soldiers
and
a
boat
and
went
there
were
then
only
bates
and
the
other
two
soldiers
aboard
and
it
was
proposed
by
william
cheshire
to
seize
the
vessel
i
was
at
first
unwilling
thinking
that
loss
of
life
might
ensue
but
cheshire
and
the
others
knowing
that
i
was
acquainted
with
navigation
having
in
happier
days
lived
much
on
the
sea
threatened
me
if
i
refused
to
join
a
song
was
started
in
the
folksle
and
one
of
the
soldiers
coming
to
listen
to
it
was
seized
and
lyon
and
riley
then
made
prisoner
of
the
sentry
forced
thus
into
a
project
with
which
i
had
at
first
but
little
sympathy
i
felt
my
heart
leap
at
the
prospect
of
freedom
and
would
have
sacrificed
all
to
obtain
it
maddened
by
the
desperate
hopes
that
inspired
me
i
from
that
moment
assumed
the
command
of
my
wretched
companions
and
honestly
think
that
however
culpable
i
may
have
been
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
i
prevented
them
from
the
display
of
a
violence
to
which
their
savage
life
had
unhappily
made
them
but
too
poor
fellow
said
sylvia
beguiled
by
master
rex
specious
paragraphs
i
think
he
was
not
to
mr
bates
was
below
in
the
cabin
and
on
being
summoned
by
cheshire
to
surrender
with
great
courage
attempted
a
defence
barker
fired
at
him
through
the
skylight
but
fearful
of
the
lives
of
the
wife
and
child
i
struck
up
his
musket
and
the
ball
passed
through
the
mouldings
of
the
stern
windows
at
the
same
time
the
soldiers
whom
we
had
bound
in
the
folksle
forced
up
the
hatch
and
came
on
deck
cheshire
shot
the
first
one
and
struck
the
other
with
his
clubbed
musket
the
wounded
man
lost
his
footing
and
the
brig
lurching
with
the
rising
tide
he
fell
into
the
sea
this
was
by
the
blessing
of
god
the
only
life
lost
in
the
whole
affair
mr
bates
seeing
now
that
we
had
possession
of
the
deck
surrendered
upon
promise
that
the
commandant
wife
and
child
should
be
put
ashore
in
safety
i
directed
him
to
take
such
matters
as
he
needed
and
prepared
to
lower
the
as
she
swung
off
the
davits
captain
frere
came
alongside
in
the
and
gallantly
endeavoured
to
board
us
but
the
boat
drifted
past
the
vessel
i
was
now
determined
to
be
free
indeed
the
minds
of
all
on
board
were
made
up
to
carry
through
the
business
and
hailing
the
swore
to
fire
into
her
unless
she
surrendered
captain
frere
refused
and
was
for
boarding
us
again
but
the
two
soldiers
joined
with
us
and
prevented
his
intention
having
now
got
the
prisoners
into
the
we
transferred
captain
frere
into
her
and
being
ourselves
in
the
compelled
captain
frere
and
bates
to
row
ashore
we
then
took
the
in
tow
and
returned
to
the
brig
a
strict
watch
being
kept
for
fear
that
they
should
rescue
the
vessel
from
us
at
break
of
day
every
man
was
upon
deck
and
a
consultation
took
place
concerning
the
parting
of
the
provisions
cheshire
was
for
leaving
them
to
starve
but
lesly
shiers
and
i
held
out
for
an
equal
division
after
a
long
and
violent
controversy
humanity
gained
the
day
and
the
provisions
were
put
into
the
and
taken
ashore
upon
the
receipt
of
the
provisions
bates
thus
expressed
himself
i
did
not
for
one
moment
expect
such
kind
treatment
from
you
regarding
the
provisions
you
have
now
brought
ashore
for
us
out
of
so
little
which
there
was
on
board
when
i
consider
your
present
undertaking
without
a
competent
navigator
and
in
a
leaky
vessel
your
situation
seems
most
perilous
therefore
i
hope
god
will
prove
kind
to
you
and
preserve
you
from
the
manifold
dangers
you
may
have
to
encounter
on
the
stormy
ocean
vickers
also
was
pleased
to
say
that
i
had
behaved
kindly
to
her
that
she
wished
me
well
and
that
when
she
returned
to
hobart
town
she
would
speak
in
my
favour
they
then
cheered
us
on
our
departure
wishing
we
might
be
prosperous
on
account
of
our
humanity
in
sharing
the
provisions
with
them
having
had
breakfast
we
commenced
throwing
overboard
the
light
cargo
which
was
in
the
hold
which
employed
us
until
dinnertime
after
dinner
we
ran
out
a
small
with
about
one
hundred
fathoms
of
line
and
having
weighed
anchor
and
the
tide
being
slack
we
hauled
on
the
and
succeeded
in
this
manner
by
kedging
along
and
we
came
to
two
islands
called
the
cap
and
bonnet
the
whole
of
us
then
commenced
heaving
the
brig
short
sending
the
to
take
her
in
tow
after
we
had
tripped
the
anchor
by
this
means
we
got
her
safe
across
the
bar
scarcely
was
this
done
when
a
light
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
and
firing
a
musket
to
apprize
the
party
we
had
left
of
our
safety
we
made
sail
and
put
out
to
having
read
thus
far
sylvia
paused
in
an
agony
of
recollection
she
remembered
the
firing
of
the
musket
and
that
her
mother
had
wept
over
her
but
beyond
this
all
was
uncertainty
memories
slipped
across
her
mind
like
shadows
she
caught
at
them
and
they
were
gone
yet
the
reading
of
this
strange
story
made
her
nerves
thrill
despite
the
hypocritical
grandiloquence
and
affected
piety
of
the
narrative
it
was
easy
to
see
that
save
some
warping
of
facts
to
make
for
himself
a
better
case
and
to
extol
the
courage
of
the
gaolers
who
had
him
at
their
mercy
the
narrator
had
not
attempted
to
better
his
tale
by
the
invention
of
perils
the
history
of
the
desperate
project
that
had
been
planned
and
carried
out
five
years
before
was
related
with
grim
simplicity
which
because
it
at
once
bears
the
stamp
of
truth
and
forces
the
imagination
of
the
reader
to
supply
the
omitted
details
of
horror
is
more
effective
to
inspire
sympathy
than
elaborate
description
the
very
barrenness
of
the
narration
was
hideously
suggestive
and
the
girl
felt
her
heart
beat
quicker
as
her
poetic
intellect
rushed
to
complete
the
terrible
picture
sketched
by
the
convict
she
saw
it
all
the
blue
sea
the
burning
sun
the
slowly
moving
ship
the
wretched
company
on
the
shore
she
heard
was
that
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
below
her
a
bird
how
nervous
she
was
growing
being
thus
fairly
rid
as
we
thought
of
our
prison
life
we
cheerfully
held
consultation
as
to
our
future
course
it
was
my
intention
to
get
among
the
islands
in
the
south
seas
and
scuttling
the
brig
to
pass
ourselves
off
among
the
natives
as
shipwrecked
seamen
trusting
to
mercy
that
some
homeward
bound
vessel
might
at
length
rescue
us
with
this
view
i
made
james
lesly
first
mate
he
being
an
experienced
mariner
and
prepared
myself
with
what
few
instruments
we
had
to
take
our
departure
from
birches
rock
having
hauled
the
alongside
we
stove
her
together
with
the
and
cast
her
adrift
this
done
i
parted
the
landsmen
with
the
seamen
and
steering
east
at
eight
we
set
our
first
watch
in
little
more
than
an
hour
after
this
came
on
a
heavy
gale
from
the
i
and
others
of
the
landsmen
were
violently
and
lesly
had
some
difficulty
in
handling
the
brig
as
the
boisterous
weather
called
for
two
men
at
the
helm
in
the
morning
getting
upon
deck
with
difficulty
i
found
that
the
wind
had
abated
but
upon
sounding
the
well
discovered
much
water
in
the
hold
lesly
rigged
the
pumps
but
the
starboard
one
only
could
be
made
to
work
from
that
time
there
were
but
two
businesses
aboard
from
the
pump
to
the
helm
the
gale
lasted
two
days
and
a
night
the
brig
running
under
topsails
we
being
afraid
to
shorten
sail
lest
we
might
be
overtaken
by
some
pursuing
vessel
so
strong
was
the
terror
of
our
prison
upon
us
on
the
at
noon
i
again
forced
myself
on
deck
and
taking
a
meridian
observation
altered
the
course
of
the
brig
to
east
and
by
south
wishing
to
run
to
the
southward
of
new
zealand
out
of
the
usual
track
of
shipping
and
having
a
notion
that
should
our
provisions
hold
out
we
might
make
the
south
american
coast
and
fall
into
christian
hands
this
done
i
was
compelled
to
retire
below
and
for
a
week
lay
in
my
berth
as
one
at
the
last
gasp
at
times
i
repented
my
resolution
fair
urging
me
to
bestir
myself
as
the
men
were
not
satisfied
with
our
course
on
the
a
mutiny
occurred
led
by
lyons
who
asserted
we
were
heading
into
the
pacific
and
must
infallibly
perish
this
disaffected
man
though
ignorant
of
navigation
insisted
upon
steering
to
the
south
believing
that
we
had
run
to
the
northward
of
the
friendly
islands
and
was
for
running
the
ship
ashore
and
beseeching
the
protection
of
the
natives
lesly
in
vain
protested
that
a
southward
course
would
bring
us
into
icefields
barker
who
had
served
on
board
a
whaler
strove
to
convince
the
mutineers
that
the
temperature
of
such
latitudes
was
too
warm
for
such
an
error
to
escape
us
after
much
noise
lyons
rushed
to
the
helm
and
russen
drawing
one
of
the
pistols
taken
from
bates
shot
him
dead
upon
which
the
others
returned
to
their
duty
this
dreadful
deed
was
i
fear
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
brig
and
had
it
occurred
on
board
a
vessel
manned
by
would
have
been
applauded
as
a
stern
but
needful
measure
forced
by
these
tumults
upon
deck
i
made
a
short
speech
to
the
crew
and
convinced
them
that
i
was
competent
to
perform
what
i
had
promised
to
do
though
at
the
time
my
heart
inwardly
failed
me
and
i
longed
for
some
sign
of
land
supported
at
each
arm
by
lesly
and
barker
i
took
an
observation
and
altered
our
course
to
north
by
east
the
brig
running
eleven
knots
an
hour
under
topsails
and
the
pumps
hard
at
work
so
we
ran
until
the
of
january
when
a
white
squall
took
us
and
nearly
proved
fatal
to
all
aboard
lesly
now
committed
a
great
error
for
upon
the
brig
righting
she
was
thrown
upon
her
beam
ends
and
her
spanker
boom
carried
away
he
commanded
to
furl
the
sail
strike
yards
furl
the
main
course
and
take
a
reef
in
the
maintopsail
leaving
her
to
scud
under
maintopsail
and
this
caused
the
vessel
to
leak
to
that
degree
that
i
despaired
of
reaching
land
in
her
and
prayed
to
the
almighty
to
send
us
speedy
assistance
for
nine
days
and
nights
the
storm
continued
the
men
being
utterly
exhausted
one
of
the
two
soldiers
whom
we
had
employed
to
fish
the
two
pieces
of
the
spanker
boom
with
some
quartering
that
we
had
was
washed
overboard
and
drowned
our
provision
was
now
nearly
done
but
the
gale
abating
on
the
ninth
day
we
hastened
to
put
provisions
on
the
launch
the
sea
was
heavy
and
we
were
compelled
to
put
a
purchase
on
the
fore
and
main
yards
with
preventers
to
windward
to
ease
the
launch
in
going
over
the
side
we
got
her
fairly
afloat
at
last
the
others
battening
down
the
hatches
in
the
brig
having
dressed
ourselves
in
the
clothes
of
captain
frere
and
the
pilot
we
left
the
brig
at
sundown
lying
with
her
channel
plates
nearly
under
water
the
wind
freshening
during
the
night
our
launch
which
might
indeed
be
termed
a
having
been
fitted
with
mast
bowsprit
and
main
boom
began
to
be
very
uneasy
shipping
two
seas
one
after
the
other
the
plan
we
could
devise
was
to
sit
four
of
us
about
in
the
stern
sheets
with
our
backs
to
the
sea
to
prevent
the
water
pooping
us
this
itself
was
enough
to
exhaust
the
strongest
men
the
day
however
made
us
some
amends
for
the
dreadful
night
land
was
not
more
than
ten
miles
from
us
approaching
as
nearly
as
we
could
with
safety
we
hauled
our
wind
and
ran
along
in
trusting
to
find
some
harbour
at
two
we
sighted
a
bay
of
very
curious
appearance
having
two
large
rocks
at
the
entrance
resembling
pyramids
shiers
russen
and
fair
landed
in
hopes
of
discovering
fresh
water
of
which
we
stood
much
in
need
before
long
they
returned
stating
that
they
had
found
an
indian
hut
inside
of
which
were
some
rude
earthenware
vessels
fearful
of
surprise
we
lay
off
the
shore
all
that
night
and
putting
into
the
bay
very
early
in
the
morning
killed
a
seal
this
was
the
first
fresh
meat
i
had
tasted
for
four
years
it
seemed
strange
to
eat
it
under
such
circumstances
we
cooked
the
flippers
heart
and
liver
for
breakfast
giving
some
to
a
cat
which
we
had
taken
with
us
out
of
the
brig
for
i
would
not
willingly
allow
even
that
animal
to
perish
after
breakfast
we
got
under
weigh
and
we
had
scarcely
been
out
half
an
hour
when
we
had
a
fresh
breeze
which
carried
us
along
at
the
rate
of
seven
knots
an
hour
running
from
bay
to
bay
to
find
inhabitants
steering
along
the
shore
as
the
sun
went
down
we
suddenly
heard
the
bellowing
of
a
bullock
and
james
barker
whom
from
his
violent
conduct
i
thought
incapable
of
such
sentiment
burst
into
tears
in
about
two
hours
we
perceived
great
fires
on
the
beach
and
let
go
anchor
in
nineteen
fathoms
of
water
we
lay
awake
all
that
night
in
the
morning
we
rowed
further
inshore
and
moored
the
boat
to
some
seaweed
as
soon
as
the
inhabitants
caught
sight
of
us
they
came
down
to
the
beach
i
distributed
needles
and
thread
among
the
indians
and
on
my
saying
a
woman
instantly
pointed
towards
a
tongue
of
land
to
the
southward
holding
up
three
fingers
and
crying
which
i
conjectured
to
be
three
leagues
the
distance
we
afterwards
found
it
to
be
about
three
in
the
afternoon
we
weathered
the
point
pointed
out
by
the
woman
and
perceived
a
flagstaff
and
a
battery
under
our
lee
i
now
divided
among
the
men
the
sum
of
six
pounds
ten
shillings
that
i
had
found
in
captain
frere
cabin
and
made
another
and
more
equal
distribution
of
the
clothing
there
were
also
two
watches
one
of
which
i
gave
to
lesly
and
kept
the
other
for
myself
it
was
resolved
among
us
to
say
that
we
were
part
crew
of
the
brig
julia
bound
for
china
and
wrecked
in
the
south
seas
upon
landing
at
the
battery
we
were
heartily
entertained
though
we
did
not
understand
one
word
of
what
they
said
next
morning
it
was
agreed
that
lesly
barker
shiers
and
russen
should
pay
for
a
canoe
to
convey
them
to
the
town
which
was
nine
miles
up
the
river
and
on
the
morning
of
the
march
they
took
their
departure
on
the
march
a
boat
commanded
by
a
lieutenant
came
down
with
orders
that
the
rest
of
us
should
be
conveyed
to
town
and
we
accordingly
launched
the
boat
under
convoy
of
the
soldiers
and
reached
the
town
the
same
evening
in
some
trepidation
i
feared
lest
the
spaniards
had
obtained
a
clue
as
to
our
real
character
and
was
not
deceived
the
surviving
soldier
having
betrayed
us
this
fellow
was
thus
doubly
a
traitor
first
in
deserting
his
officer
and
then
in
betraying
his
comrades
we
were
immediately
escorted
to
prison
where
we
found
our
four
companions
some
of
them
were
for
brazening
out
the
story
of
shipwreck
but
knowing
how
confused
must
necessarily
be
our
accounts
were
we
examined
separately
i
persuaded
them
that
open
confession
would
be
our
best
chance
of
safety
on
the
we
were
taken
before
the
intendente
or
governor
who
informed
us
that
we
were
free
on
condition
that
we
chose
to
live
within
the
limits
of
the
town
at
this
intelligence
i
felt
my
heart
grow
light
and
only
begged
in
the
name
of
my
companions
that
we
might
not
be
given
up
to
the
british
government
than
which
said
i
would
beg
to
be
shot
dead
in
the
palace
square
the
governor
regarded
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
spoke
as
follows
poor
men
do
not
think
that
i
would
take
that
advantage
over
you
do
not
make
an
attempt
to
escape
and
i
will
be
your
friend
and
should
a
vessel
come
tomorrow
to
demand
you
you
shall
find
i
will
be
as
good
as
my
word
all
i
have
to
impress
upon
you
is
to
beware
of
intemperance
which
is
very
prevalent
in
this
country
and
when
you
find
it
convenient
to
pay
government
the
money
that
was
allowed
you
for
subsistence
while
in
prison
the
following
day
we
all
procured
employment
in
launching
a
vessel
of
three
hundred
tons
burden
and
my
men
showed
themselves
so
active
that
the
owner
said
he
would
rather
have
us
than
thirty
of
his
own
countrymen
which
saying
pleased
the
governor
who
was
there
with
almost
the
whole
of
the
inhabitants
and
a
whole
band
of
music
this
vessel
having
been
nearly
three
years
on
the
stocks
after
she
was
launched
the
seamen
amongst
us
helped
to
fit
her
out
being
paid
fifteen
dollars
a
month
with
provisions
on
board
as
for
myself
i
speedily
obtained
employment
in
the
shipbuilder
yard
and
subsisted
by
honest
industry
almost
forgetting
in
the
unwonted
pleasures
of
freedom
the
sad
reverse
of
fortune
which
had
befallen
me
to
think
that
i
who
had
mingled
among
gentlemen
and
scholars
should
be
thankful
to
labour
in
a
yard
by
day
and
sleep
on
a
bundle
of
hides
by
night
but
this
is
personal
matter
and
need
not
be
obtruded
in
the
same
yard
with
me
worked
the
soldier
who
had
betrayed
us
and
i
could
not
but
regard
it
as
a
special
judgment
of
heaven
when
he
one
day
fell
from
a
great
height
and
was
taken
up
for
dead
dying
in
much
torment
in
a
few
hours
the
days
thus
passed
on
in
comparative
happiness
until
the
of
may
when
the
old
governor
took
his
departure
regretted
by
all
the
inhabitants
of
valdivia
and
the
achilles
a
brig
of
war
arrived
with
the
new
governor
one
of
the
first
acts
of
this
gentleman
was
to
sell
our
boat
which
was
moored
at
the
back
of
this
proceeding
looked
to
my
mind
indicative
of
and
fearful
lest
the
governor
should
deliver
us
again
into
bondage
i
resolved
to
make
my
escape
from
the
place
having
communicated
my
plans
to
barker
lesly
riley
shiers
and
russen
i
offered
the
governor
to
get
built
for
him
a
handsome
making
the
iron
work
myself
the
governor
consented
and
in
a
little
more
than
a
fortnight
we
had
completed
a
capable
of
weathering
either
sea
or
storm
we
fitted
her
with
sails
and
provisions
in
the
governor
name
and
on
the
of
july
being
a
saturday
night
we
took
our
departure
from
valdivia
dropping
down
the
river
shortly
after
sunset
whether
the
governor
disgusted
at
the
trick
we
had
played
him
decided
not
to
pursue
us
or
whether
as
i
rather
think
our
absence
was
not
discovered
until
the
monday
morning
when
we
were
beyond
reach
of
capture
i
know
not
but
we
got
out
to
sea
without
hazard
and
taking
accurate
bearings
ran
for
the
friendly
islands
as
had
been
agreed
upon
amongst
us
but
it
now
seemed
that
the
good
fortune
which
had
hitherto
attended
us
had
deserted
us
for
after
crawling
for
four
days
in
sultry
weather
there
fell
a
dead
calm
and
we
lay
like
a
log
upon
the
sea
for
hours
for
three
days
we
remained
in
the
midst
of
the
ocean
exposed
to
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
in
a
boat
without
water
or
provisions
on
the
fourth
day
just
as
we
had
resolved
to
draw
lots
to
determine
who
should
die
for
the
sustenance
of
the
others
we
were
picked
up
by
an
opium
clipper
returning
to
canton
the
captain
an
american
was
most
kind
to
us
and
on
our
arrival
at
canton
a
subscription
was
got
up
for
us
by
the
british
merchants
of
that
city
and
a
free
passage
to
england
obtained
for
us
russen
however
getting
in
drink
made
statements
which
brought
suspicion
upon
us
i
had
imposed
upon
the
consul
with
a
fictitious
story
of
a
wreck
but
had
stated
that
my
name
was
wilson
forgetting
that
the
sextant
which
had
been
preserved
in
the
boat
had
captain
bates
name
engraved
upon
it
these
circumstances
together
caused
sufficient
doubts
in
the
consul
mind
to
cause
him
to
give
directions
that
on
our
arrival
in
london
we
were
to
be
brought
before
the
thames
police
court
there
being
no
evidence
against
us
we
should
have
escaped
had
not
a
pine
who
had
been
surgeon
on
board
the
malabar
transport
being
in
the
court
recognized
me
and
swore
to
my
identity
we
were
remanded
and
to
complete
the
chain
of
evidence
capon
the
hobart
town
gaoler
was
strangely
enough
in
london
at
the
time
and
identified
us
all
our
story
was
then
made
public
and
barker
and
lesly
turning
queen
evidence
against
russen
he
was
convicted
of
the
murder
of
lyons
and
executed
we
were
then
placed
on
board
the
leviathan
hulk
and
remained
there
until
shipped
in
the
lady
jane
which
was
chartered
with
convicts
for
van
diemen
land
in
order
to
be
tried
in
the
colony
where
the
offence
was
committed
for
piratically
seizing
the
brig
osprey
and
arrived
here
on
the
december
coming
breathless
to
the
conclusion
of
this
wonderful
relation
sylvia
suffered
her
hand
to
fall
into
her
lap
and
sat
meditative
the
history
of
this
desperate
struggle
for
liberty
was
to
her
full
of
vague
horror
she
had
never
before
realized
among
what
manner
of
men
she
had
lived
the
sullen
creatures
who
worked
in
the
or
pulled
in
the
boats
their
faces
brutalized
into
a
uniform
blankness
must
be
very
different
men
from
john
rex
and
his
companions
her
imagination
pictured
the
voyage
in
the
leaky
brig
the
south
american
slavery
the
midnight
escape
the
desperate
rowing
the
long
slow
agony
of
starvation
and
the
that
must
have
followed
upon
recapture
and
imprisonment
surely
the
punishment
of
penal
servitude
must
have
been
made
very
terrible
for
men
to
dare
such
hideous
perils
to
escape
from
it
surely
john
rex
the
convict
who
alone
and
prostrated
by
sickness
quelled
a
mutiny
and
navigated
a
vessel
through
a
ocean
must
possess
qualities
which
could
be
put
to
better
use
than
was
the
opinion
of
maurice
frere
the
correct
one
after
all
and
were
these
convict
monsters
gifted
with
unnatural
powers
of
endurance
only
to
be
subdued
and
tamed
by
unnatural
and
inhuman
punishments
of
lash
and
chain
her
fancies
growing
amid
the
fast
gathering
gloom
she
shuddered
as
she
guessed
to
what
extremities
of
evil
might
such
men
proceed
did
an
opportunity
ever
come
to
them
to
retaliate
upon
their
gaolers
perhaps
beneath
each
mask
of
servility
and
sullen
fear
that
was
the
ordinary
prison
face
lay
hid
a
courage
and
a
despair
as
mighty
as
that
which
sustained
those
ten
poor
wanderers
over
the
pacific
ocean
maurice
had
told
her
that
these
people
had
their
secret
signs
their
secret
language
she
had
just
seen
a
specimen
of
the
skill
with
which
this
very
rex
still
bent
upon
escape
could
send
a
hidden
message
to
his
friends
beneath
the
eyes
of
his
gaolers
what
if
the
whole
island
was
but
one
smouldering
volcano
of
revolt
and
murder
the
whole
convict
population
but
one
incarnated
conspiracy
bound
together
by
crime
and
suffering
terrible
to
think
of
yet
not
impossible
oh
how
strangely
must
the
world
have
been
civilized
that
this
most
lovely
corner
of
it
must
needs
be
set
apart
as
a
place
of
banishment
for
the
monsters
that
civilization
had
brought
forth
and
bred
she
cast
her
eyes
around
and
all
beauty
seemed
blotted
out
from
the
scene
before
her
the
graceful
foliage
melting
into
indistinctness
in
the
gathering
twilight
appeared
to
her
horrible
and
treacherous
the
river
seemed
to
flow
sluggishly
as
though
thickened
with
blood
and
tears
the
shadow
of
the
trees
seemed
to
hold
lurking
shapes
of
cruelty
and
danger
even
the
whispering
breeze
bore
with
it
sighs
and
threats
and
mutterings
of
revenge
oppressed
by
a
terror
of
loneliness
she
hastily
caught
up
the
manuscript
and
turned
to
seek
the
house
when
as
if
summoned
from
the
earth
by
the
power
of
her
own
fears
a
ragged
figure
barred
her
passage
to
the
excited
girl
this
apparition
seemed
the
embodiment
of
the
unknown
evil
she
had
dreaded
she
recognized
the
yellow
clothing
and
marked
the
eager
hands
outstretched
to
seize
her
instantly
upon
her
flashed
the
story
that
three
days
since
had
set
the
agog
the
desperado
of
port
arthur
the
escaped
mutineer
and
murderer
was
before
her
with
unchained
arms
free
to
wreak
his
will
of
her
sylvia
it
is
you
oh
at
last
i
have
escaped
and
come
to
ask
what
do
you
not
know
me
pressing
both
hands
to
her
bosom
she
stepped
back
a
pace
speechless
with
terror
i
am
rufus
dawes
he
said
looking
in
her
face
for
the
grateful
smile
of
recognition
that
did
not
come
rufus
the
party
at
the
house
had
finished
their
wine
and
sitting
on
the
broad
verandah
were
listening
to
some
gentle
dullness
of
the
clergyman
when
there
broke
upon
their
ears
a
cry
what
that
said
vickers
frere
sprang
up
and
looked
down
the
garden
he
saw
two
figures
that
seemed
to
struggle
together
one
glance
was
enough
and
with
a
shout
he
leapt
the
and
made
straight
at
the
escaped
prisoner
rufus
dawes
saw
him
coming
but
secure
in
the
protection
of
the
girl
who
owed
to
him
so
much
he
advanced
a
step
nearer
and
loosing
his
respectful
clasp
of
her
hand
caught
her
dress
oh
help
maurice
help
cried
sylvia
again
into
the
face
of
rufus
dawes
came
an
expression
of
bewilderment
for
three
days
the
unhappy
man
had
contrived
to
keep
life
and
freedom
in
order
to
get
speech
with
the
one
being
who
he
thought
cherished
for
him
some
affection
having
made
an
unparalleled
escape
from
the
midst
of
his
warders
he
had
crept
to
the
place
where
lived
the
idol
of
his
dreams
braving
recapture
that
he
might
hear
from
her
two
words
of
justice
and
gratitude
not
only
did
she
refuse
to
listen
to
him
and
shrink
from
him
as
from
one
accursed
but
at
the
sound
of
his
name
she
summoned
his
deadliest
foe
to
capture
him
such
monstrous
ingratitude
was
almost
beyond
belief
she
too
the
child
he
had
nursed
and
fed
the
child
for
whom
he
had
given
up
his
chance
of
freedom
and
fortune
the
child
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
the
child
whose
image
he
had
worshipped
she
too
against
him
then
there
was
no
justice
no
heaven
no
god
he
loosed
his
hold
of
her
dress
and
regardless
of
the
approaching
footsteps
stood
speechless
shaking
from
head
to
foot
in
another
instant
frere
and
mcnab
flung
themselves
upon
him
and
he
was
borne
to
the
ground
though
weakened
by
starvation
he
shook
them
off
with
scarce
an
effort
and
despite
the
servants
who
came
hurrying
from
the
alarmed
house
might
even
then
have
turned
and
made
good
his
escape
but
he
seemed
unable
to
fly
his
chest
heaved
convulsively
great
drops
of
sweat
beaded
his
white
face
and
from
his
eyes
tears
seemed
about
to
break
for
an
instant
his
features
worked
convulsively
as
if
he
would
fain
invoke
upon
the
girl
weeping
on
her
father
shoulder
some
hideous
curse
but
no
words
came
only
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
breast
with
a
supreme
gesture
of
horror
and
aversion
he
flung
something
from
him
then
a
profound
sigh
escaped
him
and
he
held
out
his
hands
to
be
bound
there
was
something
so
pitiable
about
this
silent
grief
that
as
they
led
him
away
the
little
group
instinctively
averted
their
faces
lest
they
should
seem
to
triumph
over
him
chapter
xi
a
relic
of
macquarie
harbour
you
must
try
and
save
him
from
further
punishment
said
sylvia
next
day
to
frere
i
did
not
mean
to
betray
the
poor
creature
but
i
had
made
myself
nervous
by
reading
that
convict
you
should
read
such
rubbish
said
frere
what
the
use
i
suppose
a
word
of
it
it
must
be
true
i
am
sure
it
true
oh
maurice
these
are
dreadful
men
i
thought
i
knew
all
about
convicts
but
i
had
no
idea
that
such
men
as
these
were
among
thank
god
you
know
very
little
said
maurice
the
servants
you
have
here
are
very
different
sort
of
fellows
from
rex
and
oh
maurice
i
am
so
tired
of
this
place
it
wrong
perhaps
with
poor
papa
and
all
but
i
do
wish
i
was
somewhere
out
of
the
sight
of
chains
i
do
know
what
has
made
me
feel
as
i
come
to
sydney
said
frere
there
are
not
so
many
convicts
there
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
go
to
sydney
you
for
our
honeymoon
yes
said
sylvia
simply
i
know
it
was
but
we
are
not
married
that
easily
done
said
maurice
oh
nonsense
sir
but
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
this
poor
dawes
i
do
think
he
meant
any
harm
it
seems
to
me
now
that
he
was
rather
going
to
ask
for
food
or
something
only
i
was
so
nervous
they
hang
him
maurice
will
they
no
said
maurice
i
spoke
to
your
father
this
morning
if
the
fellow
is
tried
for
his
life
you
may
have
to
give
evidence
and
so
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
port
arthur
again
and
heavy
irons
will
meet
the
case
we
gave
him
another
life
sentence
this
morning
that
will
make
the
third
he
has
what
did
he
say
nothing
i
sent
him
down
aboard
the
schooner
at
once
he
ought
to
be
out
of
the
river
by
this
maurice
i
have
a
strange
feeling
about
that
eh
said
maurice
i
seem
to
fear
him
as
if
i
knew
some
story
about
him
and
yet
know
that
not
very
clear
said
maurice
forcing
a
laugh
but
let
talk
about
him
any
more
we
soon
be
far
from
port
arthur
and
everybody
in
maurice
said
she
caressingly
i
love
you
dear
you
always
protect
me
against
these
men
wo
you
maurice
kissed
her
you
have
not
got
over
your
fright
sylvia
he
said
i
see
i
shall
have
to
take
a
great
deal
of
care
of
my
of
course
replied
sylvia
and
then
the
pair
began
to
make
love
or
rather
maurice
made
it
and
sylvia
suffered
him
suddenly
her
eye
caught
something
what
that
there
on
the
ground
by
the
fountain
they
were
near
the
spot
where
dawes
had
been
seized
the
night
before
a
little
stream
ran
through
the
garden
and
a
triton
of
convict
manufacture
blew
his
horn
in
the
middle
of
a
convict
built
rockery
under
the
lip
of
the
fountain
lay
a
small
packet
frere
picked
it
up
it
was
made
of
soiled
yellow
cloth
and
stitched
evidently
by
a
man
fingers
it
looks
like
a
said
he
let
me
see
what
a
thing
yellow
cloth
too
why
it
must
belong
to
a
prisoner
oh
maurice
the
man
who
was
here
last
night
ay
says
maurice
turning
over
the
packet
it
might
have
been
his
sure
he
seemed
to
fling
something
from
him
i
thought
perhaps
this
is
it
said
she
peering
over
his
arm
in
delicate
curiosity
frere
with
something
of
a
scowl
on
his
brow
tore
off
the
outer
covering
of
the
mysterious
packet
and
displayed
a
second
envelope
of
grey
cloth
the
uniform
beneath
this
was
a
piece
some
three
inches
square
of
stained
and
discoloured
merino
that
had
once
been
blue
hullo
says
frere
why
what
this
it
is
a
piece
of
a
dress
says
sylvia
it
was
rufus
dawes
talisman
a
portion
of
the
frock
she
had
worn
at
macquarie
harbour
and
which
the
unhappy
convict
had
cherished
as
a
sacred
relic
for
five
weary
years
frere
flung
it
into
the
water
the
running
stream
whirled
it
away
why
did
you
do
that
cried
the
girl
with
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
for
which
she
could
not
account
the
shred
of
cloth
caught
by
a
weed
lingered
for
an
instant
on
the
surface
of
the
water
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
pair
raising
their
eyes
saw
the
schooner
which
bore
rufus
dawes
back
to
bondage
glide
past
the
opening
of
the
trees
and
disappear
when
they
looked
again
for
the
strange
relic
of
the
desperado
of
port
arthur
it
also
had
vanished
chapter
xii
at
port
arthur
the
usual
clanking
and
hammering
was
prevalent
upon
the
stone
jetty
of
port
arthur
when
the
schooner
bearing
the
returned
convict
rufus
dawes
ran
alongside
on
the
heights
above
the
esplanade
rose
the
grim
front
of
the
soldiers
barracks
beneath
the
soldiers
barracks
was
the
long
range
of
prison
buildings
with
their
workshops
and
to
the
left
lay
the
commandant
house
authoritative
by
reason
of
its
embrasured
terrace
and
guardian
sentry
while
the
jetty
that
faced
the
purple
length
of
the
island
of
the
dead
swarmed
with
figures
clanking
about
their
enforced
business
under
the
muskets
of
their
gaolers
rufus
dawes
had
seen
this
prospect
before
had
learnt
by
heart
each
beauty
of
rising
sun
sparkling
water
and
wooded
hill
from
the
hideously
clean
jetty
at
his
feet
to
the
distant
signal
station
that
embowered
in
bloom
reared
its
slender
arms
upwards
into
the
cloudless
sky
he
knew
it
all
there
was
no
charm
for
him
in
the
exquisite
blue
of
the
sea
the
soft
shadows
of
the
hills
or
the
soothing
ripple
of
the
waves
that
crept
voluptuously
to
the
white
breast
of
the
shining
shore
he
sat
with
his
head
bowed
down
and
his
hands
clasped
about
his
knees
disdaining
to
look
until
they
roused
him
hallo
dawes
says
warder
troke
halting
his
train
of
ironed
so
you
come
back
again
glad
to
see
yer
dawes
it
seems
an
age
since
we
had
the
pleasure
of
your
company
dawes
at
this
pleasantry
the
train
laughed
so
that
their
irons
clanked
more
than
ever
they
found
it
often
inconvenient
not
to
laugh
at
humour
step
down
here
dawes
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
your
friends
they
be
glad
to
see
yer
wo
yer
boys
why
bless
me
dawes
we
thort
we
lost
yer
we
thort
yer
given
us
the
slip
altogether
dawes
they
did
take
care
of
yer
in
hobart
town
i
expect
eh
boys
we
look
after
yer
here
dawes
though
you
bolt
any
take
care
troke
said
a
warning
voice
you
at
it
again
let
the
man
alone
by
virtue
of
an
order
transmitted
from
hobart
town
they
had
begun
to
attach
the
dangerous
prisoner
to
the
last
man
of
the
gang
riveting
the
of
the
pair
by
means
of
an
extra
link
which
could
be
removed
when
necessary
but
dawes
had
given
no
sign
of
consciousness
at
the
sound
of
the
friendly
tones
however
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
tall
gaunt
man
dressed
in
a
shabby
raiment
and
wearing
a
black
handkerchief
knotted
round
his
throat
he
was
a
stranger
to
him
i
beg
yer
pardon
north
said
troke
sinking
at
once
the
bully
in
the
sneak
i
did
see
yer
a
parson
thought
dawes
with
disappointment
and
dropped
his
eyes
i
know
that
returned
north
coolly
if
you
had
you
would
have
been
all
butter
and
honey
do
trouble
yourself
to
tell
a
lie
quite
dawes
looked
up
again
this
was
a
strange
parson
what
your
name
my
man
said
north
suddenly
catching
his
eye
rufus
dawes
had
intended
to
scowl
but
the
tone
sharply
authoritative
roused
his
automatic
convict
second
nature
and
he
answered
almost
despite
himself
rufus
oh
said
north
eyeing
him
with
a
curious
air
of
expectation
that
had
something
pitying
in
it
this
is
the
man
is
it
i
thought
he
was
to
go
to
the
coal
so
he
is
said
troke
but
we
hai
a
goin
to
send
there
for
a
fortnit
and
in
the
meantime
i
to
work
him
on
the
oh
said
north
again
lend
me
your
knife
and
then
before
them
all
this
curious
parson
took
a
piece
of
tobacco
out
of
his
ragged
pocket
and
cut
off
a
chaw
with
troke
knife
rufus
dawes
felt
what
he
had
not
felt
for
three
days
an
interest
in
something
he
stared
at
the
parson
in
unaffected
astonishment
north
perhaps
mistook
the
meaning
of
his
fixed
stare
for
he
held
out
the
remnant
of
tobacco
to
him
the
chain
line
vibrated
at
this
and
bent
forward
to
enjoy
the
vicarious
delight
of
seeing
another
man
chew
tobacco
troke
grinned
with
a
silent
mirth
that
betokened
retribution
for
the
favoured
convict
here
said
north
holding
out
the
dainty
morsel
upon
which
so
many
eyes
were
fixed
rufus
dawes
took
the
tobacco
looked
at
it
hungrily
for
an
instant
and
then
to
the
astonishment
of
everybody
flung
it
away
with
a
curse
i
do
want
your
tobacco
he
said
keep
from
convict
mouths
went
out
a
respectful
roar
of
amazement
and
troke
eyes
snapped
with
pride
of
outraged
janitorship
you
ungrateful
dog
he
cried
raising
his
stick
north
put
up
a
hand
that
will
do
troke
he
said
i
know
your
respect
for
the
cloth
move
the
men
on
get
on
said
troke
rumbling
oaths
beneath
his
breath
and
dawes
felt
his
chain
tug
it
was
some
time
since
he
had
been
in
a
and
the
sudden
jerk
nearly
overbalanced
him
he
caught
at
his
neighbour
and
looking
up
met
a
pair
of
black
eyes
which
gleamed
recognition
his
neighbour
was
john
rex
north
watching
them
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
the
two
men
bore
to
each
other
their
height
eyes
hair
and
complexion
were
similar
despite
the
difference
in
name
they
might
be
related
they
might
be
brothers
thought
he
poor
devils
i
never
knew
a
prisoner
refuse
tobacco
and
he
looked
on
the
ground
for
the
despised
portion
but
in
vain
john
rex
oppressed
by
no
foolish
sentiment
had
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
so
rufus
dawes
was
relegated
to
his
old
life
again
and
came
back
to
his
prison
with
the
hatred
of
his
kind
that
his
prison
had
bred
in
him
increased
a
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sudden
awakening
had
dazed
him
that
the
flood
of
light
so
suddenly
let
in
upon
his
slumbering
soul
had
blinded
his
eyes
used
so
long
to
the
twilight
he
was
at
first
unable
to
apprehend
the
details
of
his
misery
he
knew
only
that
his
was
alive
and
shuddered
at
him
that
the
only
thing
he
loved
and
trusted
had
betrayed
him
that
all
hope
of
justice
and
mercy
had
gone
from
him
for
ever
that
the
beauty
had
gone
from
earth
the
brightness
from
heaven
and
that
he
was
doomed
still
to
live
he
went
about
his
work
unheedful
of
the
jests
of
troke
ungalled
by
his
irons
unmindful
of
the
groans
and
laughter
about
him
his
magnificent
muscles
saved
him
from
the
lash
for
the
amiable
troke
tried
to
break
him
down
in
vain
he
did
not
complain
he
did
not
laugh
he
did
not
weep
his
mate
rex
tried
to
converse
with
him
but
did
not
succeed
in
the
midst
of
one
of
rex
excellent
tales
of
london
dissipation
rufus
dawes
would
sigh
wearily
something
on
that
fellow
mind
thought
rex
prone
to
watch
the
signs
by
which
the
soul
is
read
he
has
some
secret
which
weighs
upon
it
was
in
vain
that
rex
attempted
to
discover
what
this
secret
might
be
to
all
questions
concerning
his
past
life
however
artfully
put
rufus
dawes
was
dumb
in
vain
rex
practised
all
his
arts
called
up
all
his
graces
of
manner
and
speech
and
these
were
not
few
to
fascinate
the
silent
man
and
win
his
confidence
rufus
dawes
met
his
advances
with
a
cynical
carelessness
that
revealed
nothing
and
when
not
addressed
held
a
gloomy
silence
galled
by
this
indifference
john
rex
had
attempted
to
practise
those
ingenious
arts
of
torment
by
which
gabbett
vetch
or
other
leading
spirits
of
the
gang
asserted
their
superiority
over
their
quieter
comrades
but
he
soon
ceased
i
have
been
longer
in
this
hell
than
you
said
rufus
dawes
and
i
know
more
of
the
tricks
than
you
can
show
me
you
had
best
be
rex
neglected
the
warning
and
rufus
dawes
took
him
by
the
throat
one
day
and
would
have
strangled
him
but
that
troke
beat
off
the
angered
man
with
a
favourite
bludgeon
rex
had
a
wholesome
respect
for
personal
prowess
and
had
the
grace
to
admit
the
provocation
to
troke
even
this
instance
of
did
not
move
the
stubborn
dawes
he
only
laughed
then
rex
came
to
a
conclusion
his
mate
was
plotting
an
escape
he
himself
cherished
a
notion
of
the
kind
as
did
gabbett
and
vetch
but
by
common
distrust
no
one
ever
gave
utterance
to
thoughts
of
this
nature
it
would
be
too
dangerous
he
would
be
a
good
comrade
for
a
rush
thought
rex
and
resolved
more
firmly
than
ever
to
ally
himself
to
this
dangerous
and
silent
companion
one
question
dawes
had
asked
which
rex
had
been
able
to
answer
who
is
that
north
a
chaplain
he
is
only
here
for
a
week
or
so
there
is
a
new
one
coming
north
goes
to
sydney
he
is
not
in
favour
with
the
how
do
you
know
by
deduction
says
rex
with
a
smile
peculiar
to
him
he
wears
coloured
clothes
and
smokes
and
does
patter
scripture
the
bishop
dresses
in
black
detests
tobacco
and
quotes
the
bible
like
a
concordance
north
is
sent
here
for
a
month
as
a
for
that
ass
meekin
ergo
the
bishop
do
care
about
jemmy
vetch
who
was
next
to
rex
let
the
full
weight
of
his
portion
of
rest
upon
gabbett
in
order
to
express
his
unrestrained
admiration
of
rex
sarcasm
ai
the
dandy
a
said
he
are
you
thinking
of
coming
the
pious
asked
rex
it
no
good
with
north
wait
until
the
meekin
comes
you
can
twist
that
worthy
successor
of
the
apostles
round
your
little
finger
silence
there
cries
the
overseer
do
you
want
me
to
report
yer
amid
such
diversions
the
days
rolled
on
and
rufus
dawes
almost
longed
for
the
coal
mines
to
be
sent
from
the
settlement
to
the
coal
mines
and
from
the
coal
mines
to
the
settlement
was
to
these
unhappy
men
a
trip
at
port
arthur
one
went
to
an
as
more
fortunate
people
go
to
queenscliff
or
the
ocean
beach
for
change
of
air
chapter
xiii
the
commandant
butler
rufus
dawes
had
been
a
fortnight
at
the
settlement
when
a
appeared
on
the
this
was
a
young
man
of
about
twenty
years
of
age
thin
fair
and
delicate
his
name
was
kirkland
and
he
belonged
to
what
were
known
as
the
educated
prisoners
he
had
been
a
clerk
in
a
banking
house
and
was
transported
for
embezzlement
though
by
some
grave
doubts
as
to
his
guilt
were
entertained
the
commandant
captain
burgess
had
employed
him
as
butler
in
his
own
house
and
his
fate
was
considered
a
lucky
one
so
doubtless
it
was
and
might
have
been
had
not
an
untoward
accident
occurred
captain
burgess
who
was
a
bachelor
of
the
old
school
confessed
to
an
amiable
weakness
for
blasphemy
and
was
given
to
condemning
the
convicts
eyes
and
limbs
with
indiscriminate
violence
kirkland
belonged
to
a
methodist
family
and
owned
a
piety
utterly
out
of
place
in
that
region
the
language
of
burgess
made
him
shudder
and
one
day
he
so
far
forgot
himself
and
his
place
as
to
raise
his
hands
to
his
ears
my
blank
cried
burgess
you
blank
blank
is
that
your
blank
game
i
blank
soon
cure
you
of
that
and
forthwith
ordered
him
to
the
for
insubordination
he
was
received
with
suspicion
by
the
gang
who
did
not
like
prisoners
troke
by
way
of
experiment
in
human
nature
perhaps
placed
him
next
to
gabbett
the
day
was
got
through
in
the
usual
way
and
kirkland
felt
his
heart
revive
the
toil
was
severe
and
the
companionship
uncouth
but
despite
his
blistered
hands
and
aching
back
he
had
not
experienced
anything
so
very
terrible
after
all
when
the
muster
bell
rang
and
the
gang
broke
up
rufus
dawes
on
his
silent
way
to
his
separate
cell
observed
a
notable
change
of
custom
in
the
disposition
of
the
new
convict
instead
of
placing
him
in
a
cell
by
himself
troke
was
turning
him
into
the
yard
with
the
others
i
not
to
go
in
there
says
the
clerk
drawing
back
in
dismay
from
the
cloud
of
foul
faces
which
lowered
upon
him
by
the
lord
but
you
are
then
says
troke
the
governor
says
a
night
in
there
take
the
starch
out
of
ye
come
in
yer
but
troke
stow
your
gaff
says
troke
with
another
oath
and
impatiently
striking
the
lad
with
his
thong
i
ca
argue
here
all
night
get
so
kirkland
aged
and
the
son
of
methodist
parents
went
in
rufus
dawes
among
whose
sinister
memories
this
yard
was
numbered
sighed
so
fierce
was
the
glamour
of
the
place
however
that
when
locked
into
his
cell
he
felt
ashamed
for
that
sigh
and
strove
to
erase
the
memory
of
it
what
is
he
more
than
anybody
else
said
the
wretched
man
to
himself
as
he
hugged
his
misery
close
about
dawn
the
next
morning
north
who
amongst
other
vagaries
not
approved
of
by
his
bishop
had
a
habit
of
prowling
about
the
prison
at
unofficial
hours
was
attracted
by
a
dispute
at
the
door
of
the
dormitory
what
the
matter
here
he
asked
a
prisoner
refractory
your
reverence
said
the
watchman
wants
to
come
mr
north
north
cried
a
voice
for
the
love
of
god
let
me
out
of
this
place
kirkland
ghastly
pale
bleeding
with
his
woollen
shirt
torn
and
his
blue
eyes
wide
open
with
terror
was
clinging
to
the
bars
oh
north
north
oh
north
oh
for
god
sake
north
what
kirkland
cried
north
who
was
ignorant
of
the
vengeance
of
the
commandant
what
do
you
do
here
but
kirkland
could
do
nothing
but
cry
oh
north
for
god
sake
north
and
beat
on
the
bars
with
white
and
sweating
hands
let
him
out
watchman
said
north
ca
sir
without
an
order
from
the
i
order
you
sir
north
cried
indignant
very
sorry
your
reverence
but
your
reverence
knows
that
i
dare
do
such
a
mr
north
screamed
kirkland
would
you
see
me
perish
body
and
soul
in
this
place
north
oh
you
ministers
of
christ
wolves
in
sheep
clothing
you
shall
be
judged
for
this
let
him
out
cried
north
again
stamping
his
foot
it
no
good
returned
the
gaoler
i
ca
if
he
was
dying
i
north
rushed
away
to
the
commandant
and
the
instant
his
back
was
turned
hailes
the
watchman
flung
open
the
door
and
darted
into
the
dormitory
take
that
he
cried
dealing
kirkland
a
blow
on
the
head
with
his
keys
that
stretched
him
senseless
there
more
trouble
with
you
bloody
aristocrats
than
enough
lie
quiet
the
commandant
roused
from
slumber
told
north
that
kirkland
might
stop
where
he
was
and
that
he
thank
the
chaplain
not
to
wake
him
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
because
a
blank
prisoner
set
up
a
blank
howling
but
my
good
sir
protested
north
restraining
his
impulse
to
overstep
the
bounds
of
modesty
in
his
language
to
his
superior
officer
you
know
the
character
of
the
men
in
that
ward
you
can
guess
what
that
unhappy
boy
has
impertinent
young
beggar
said
burgess
do
him
good
curse
him
north
i
sorry
you
should
have
had
the
trouble
to
come
here
but
will
you
let
me
go
to
sleep
north
returned
to
the
prison
disconsolately
found
the
dutiful
hailes
at
his
post
and
all
quiet
what
become
of
kirkland
he
asked
fretted
hisself
to
sleep
yer
reverence
said
hailes
in
accents
of
parental
concern
poor
young
chap
it
hard
for
such
young
in
the
morning
rufus
dawes
coming
to
his
place
on
the
was
struck
by
the
altered
appearance
of
kirkland
his
face
was
of
a
greenish
tint
and
wore
an
expression
of
bewildered
horror
cheer
up
man
said
dawes
touched
with
momentary
pity
it
no
good
being
in
the
mopes
you
what
do
they
do
if
you
try
to
bolt
whispered
kirkland
kill
you
returned
dawes
in
a
tone
of
surprise
at
so
preposterous
a
question
thank
god
said
kirkland
now
then
miss
nancy
said
one
of
the
men
what
the
matter
with
you
kirkland
shuddered
and
his
pale
face
grew
crimson
oh
he
said
that
such
a
wretch
as
i
should
live
silence
cried
troke
no
if
you
ca
hold
your
tongue
i
give
you
something
to
talk
about
march
the
work
of
the
gang
that
afternoon
was
the
carrying
of
some
heavy
logs
to
the
and
rufus
dawes
observed
that
kirkland
was
exhausted
long
before
the
task
was
accomplished
they
kill
you
you
little
beggar
said
he
not
unkindly
what
have
you
been
doing
to
get
into
this
scrape
have
you
ever
been
in
that
that
place
i
was
in
last
night
asked
kirkland
rufus
dawes
nodded
does
the
commandant
know
what
goes
on
there
i
suppose
so
what
does
he
care
care
man
do
you
believe
in
a
god
no
said
dawes
not
here
hold
up
my
lad
if
you
fall
we
must
fall
over
you
and
then
you
done
he
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
when
the
boy
flung
himself
beneath
the
log
in
another
instant
the
train
would
have
been
scrambling
over
his
crushed
body
had
not
gabbett
stretched
out
an
iron
hand
and
plucked
the
suicide
from
death
hold
on
to
me
miss
nancy
said
the
giant
i
big
enough
to
carry
something
in
the
tone
or
manner
of
the
speaker
affected
kirkland
to
disgust
for
spurning
the
offered
hand
he
uttered
a
cry
and
then
holding
up
his
irons
with
his
hands
he
started
to
run
for
the
water
halt
you
young
fool
roared
troke
raising
his
carbine
but
kirkland
kept
steadily
on
for
the
river
just
as
he
reached
it
however
the
figure
of
north
rose
from
behind
a
pile
of
stones
kirkland
jumped
for
the
jetty
missed
his
footing
and
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
chaplain
you
young
vermin
you
shall
pay
for
this
cries
troke
you
see
if
you
wo
remember
this
oh
north
says
kirkland
why
did
you
stop
me
i
better
be
dead
than
stay
another
night
in
that
you
get
it
my
lad
said
gabbett
when
the
runaway
was
brought
back
your
blessed
hide
feel
for
this
see
if
it
kirkland
only
breathed
harder
and
looked
round
for
north
but
north
had
gone
the
new
chaplain
was
to
arrive
that
afternoon
and
it
was
incumbent
on
him
to
be
at
the
reception
troke
reported
the
clerk
that
night
to
burgess
and
burgess
who
was
about
to
go
to
dinner
with
the
new
chaplain

of
his
case

to

says
troke
kirkland

put
into
a
separate
cell
that
night
and
troke
by
way
of
assuring
him
a
good
night
rest
told
him
that
he
was
to
have
fifty
in
the
morning
and
dawes

added
he
one
of
the
smartest
men

and
he
wo
spare
yer
yer
may
take
your
oath
of
chapter
xiv
north
disposition
you
will
find
this
a
terrible
place
meekin
said
north
to
his
supplanter
as
they
walked
across
to
the
commandant
to
dinner
it
has
made
me
i
thought
it
was
a
little
paradise
said
meekin
captain
frere
says
that
the
scenery
is
so
it
is
returned
north
looking
askance
but
the
prisoners
are
not
poor
abandoned
wretches
says
meekin
i
suppose
not
how
sweet
the
moonlight
sleeps
upon
that
bank
eh
abandoned
indeed
by
god
and
man
mr
north
providence
never
abandons
the
most
unworthy
of
his
servants
never
have
i
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
their
bread
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
he
is
with
us
his
staff
you
know
north
really
the
commandant
house
is
charmingly
situated
north
sighed
again
you
have
not
been
long
in
the
colony
meekin
i
doubt
forgive
me
for
expressing
myself
so
freely
if
you
quite
know
of
our
convict
an
admirable
one
a
most
admirable
one
said
meekin
there
were
a
few
matters
i
noticed
in
hobart
town
that
did
not
quite
please
me
the
frequent
use
of
profane
language
for
instance
but
on
the
whole
i
was
delighted
with
the
scheme
it
is
so
north
pursed
up
his
lips
yes
it
is
very
complete
he
said
almost
too
complete
but
i
am
always
in
a
minority
when
i
discuss
the
question
so
we
will
drop
it
if
you
if
you
please
said
meekin
gravely
he
had
heard
from
the
bishop
that
north
was
an
sort
of
person
who
smoked
clay
pipes
had
been
detected
in
drinking
beer
out
of
a
pewter
pot
and
had
been
heard
to
state
that
white
were
of
no
consequence
the
dinner
went
off
successfully
burgess
desirous
perhaps
of
favourably
impressing
the
chaplain
whom
the
bishop
delighted
to
honour
shut
off
his
blasphemy
for
a
while
and
was
urbane
enough
you
find
us
rough
meekin
he
said
but
you
find
us
there
when
we
wanted
this
is
a
little
kingdom
in
like
béranger
asked
meekin
with
a
smile
captain
burgess
had
never
heard
of
béranger
but
he
smiled
as
if
he
had
learnt
his
words
by
heart
or
like
sancho
panza
island
said
north
you
remember
how
justice
was
administered
there
not
at
this
moment
sir
said
burgess
with
dignity
he
had
been
often
oppressed
by
the
notion
that
the
reverend
north
chaffed
him
pray
help
yourself
to
thank
you
none
said
north
filling
a
tumbler
with
water
i
have
a
his
manner
of
speech
and
action
was
so
awkward
that
a
silence
fell
upon
the
party
caused
by
each
one
wondering
why
north
should
grow
confused
and
drum
his
fingers
on
the
table
and
stare
everywhere
but
at
the
decanter
meekin
ever
softly
at
his
ease
was
the
first
to
speak
have
you
many
visitors
captain
burgess
very
few
sometimes
a
party
comes
over
with
a
recommendation
from
the
governor
and
i
show
them
over
the
place
but
as
a
rule
we
see
no
one
but
i
asked
said
meekin
because
some
friends
of
mine
were
thinking
of
and
who
may
they
be
do
you
know
captain
frere
frere
i
should
say
so
returned
burgess
with
a
laugh
modelled
upon
maurice
frere
own
i
was
quartered
with
him
at
sarah
island
so
a
friend
of
yours
eh
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
him
in
society
he
is
just
married
you
is
he
said
burgess
the
devil
he
is
i
heard
something
about
it
miss
vickers
a
charming
young
person
they
are
going
to
sydney
where
captain
frere
has
some
interest
and
frere
thinks
of
taking
port
arthur
on
his
way
a
strange
fancy
for
a
honeymoon
trip
said
north
captain
frere
takes
a
deep
interest
in
all
relating
to
convict
discipline
went
on
meekin
unheeding
the
interruption
and
is
anxious
that
frere
should
see
this
yes
one
ought
to
leave
the
colony
without
seeing
it
says
burgess
it
worth
so
captain
frere
thinks
a
romantic
story
captain
burgess
he
saved
her
life
you
ah
that
was
a
queer
thing
that
mutiny
said
burgess
we
got
the
fellows
here
you
i
saw
them
tried
at
hobart
town
said
meekin
in
fact
the
ringleader
john
rex
gave
me
his
confession
and
i
sent
it
to
the
a
great
rascal
put
in
north
a
dangerous
scheming
cold
blooded
well
now
said
meekin
with
asperity
i
do
agree
with
you
everybody
seems
to
be
against
that
poor
fellow
captain
frere
tried
to
make
me
think
that
his
letters
contained
a
hidden
meaning
but
i
do
believe
they
did
he
seems
to
me
to
be
truly
penitent
for
his
offences
a
misguided
but
not
a
hypocritical
man
if
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
goes
for
i
hope
he
is
said
north
i
would
trust
oh
there
no
fear
of
him
said
burgess
cheerily
if
he
grows
uproarious
we
soon
give
him
a
touch
of
the
i
suppose
severity
is
necessary
returned
meekin
though
to
my
ears
a
flogging
sounds
a
little
distasteful
it
is
a
brutal
it
a
punishment
for
brutes
said
burgess
and
laughed
pleased
with
the
nearest
approach
to
an
epigram
he
ever
made
in
his
life
here
attention
was
called
by
the
strange
behaviour
of
north
he
had
risen
and
without
apology
flung
wide
the
window
as
though
he
gasped
for
air
hullo
north
what
the
matter
nothing
said
north
recovering
himself
with
an
effort
a
spasm
i
have
these
attacks
at
have
some
brandy
said
burgess
no
no
it
will
pass
no
i
say
well
if
you
and
seizing
the
tumbler
offered
to
him
he
it
with
raw
spirit
and
swallowed
the
fiery
draught
at
a
gulp
the
reverend
meekin
eyed
his
clerical
brother
with
horror
the
reverend
meekin
was
not
accustomed
to
clergymen
who
wore
black
neckties
smoked
clay
pipes
chewed
tobacco
and
drank
neat
brandy
out
of
tumblers
ha
said
north
looking
wildly
round
upon
them
that
let
us
go
on
to
the
verandah
said
burgess
it
cooler
than
in
the
so
they
went
on
to
the
verandah
and
looked
down
upon
the
lights
of
the
prison
and
listened
to
the
sea
lapping
the
shore
the
reverend
north
in
this
cool
atmosphere
seemed
to
recover
himself
and
conversation
progressed
with
some
sprightliness
by
and
by
a
short
figure
smoking
a
cheroot
came
up
out
of
the
dark
and
proved
to
be
macklewain
who
had
been
prevented
from
attending
the
dinner
by
reason
of
an
accident
to
a
constable
at
norfolk
bay
which
had
claimed
his
professional
attention
well
how

burgess

macklewain

glass
of

macklewain

i
must
also
be
thinking
of

meekin
the
journey
though
most
enjoyable

fatigued
come
on
then

macklewain

speak
with

a
before
the
two
clergymen
had
got
down
the
steep
path
that
led
from
the
commandant
house
to
the
flat
on
which
the
cottages
of
the
doctor
and
chaplain
were
built
macklewain
rejoined
them
another
flogging

he
grumblingly
up
at

macklewain
fifty
oh

be
stopped
cried
north
in
great
alarm
he
ca
stand
it
i
tell
you
he
die
perhaps
you
have
the
goodness
to
allow
me
to
be
the
best
judge
of
that
returned
macklewain
drawing
up
his
little
body
to
its
least
insignificant
stature
my
dear
sir
replied
north
alive
to
the
importance
of
conciliating
the
surgeon
you
have
seen
him
lately
he
tried
to
drown
himself
this
meekin
expressed
some
alarm
but
macklewain
him
that
sort
of
nonsense
must
be
stopped
said
he
a
nice
example
to
set
i
wonder
burgess
did
give
him
a
he
was
put
into
the
long
dormitory
said
north
you

what
sort
of
a
place

agony
and
shame

macklewain
and
that

cries
north
in
great
heat
the
condition
of
those
dormitories
is
if
the
boy
has
anything
to
complain
of
why
do
he
complain
we
do
anything
without
complain
would
his
life
be
safe
if
he
did
besides
he
not
the
sort
of
creature
to
complain
he
rather
kill
that
all
nonsense
says
macklewain
we
ca
flog
a
whole
dormitory
on
suspicion
i
ca
help
it
the
boy
made
his
bed
and
he
must
lie
on

my
room

he
sleeps
at
the
back
and
north
hurried
off
an
impulsive
gentleman
said
meekin
to
macklewain
as
the
sound
of
north
footsteps
died
away
in
the
distance
macklewain
shook
his
head
seriously
there
is
something
wrong
about
him
but
i
ca
make
out
what
it
is
he
has
the
strangest
fits
at
times
unless

a
cancer
in
the
stomach
i
do

said
meekin
shutting
the
little
gate
and
save
the
unfortunate
kirkland
once
captain
burgess

shutting
his

macklewain

captain

north
his
pale
face

i

your
head

sir
i
have

until

shipped
out
of

this
of
course
was
mere
bravado
on
the
part
of
the
commandant
north
knew
well
that
he
would
never
dare
to
attempt
any
such
act
of
violence
but
the
insult
stung
him
like
the
cut
of
a
whip
he
made
a
stride
towards
the
commandant
as
though
to
seize
him
by
the
throat
but
checking
himself
in
time
stood
still
with
clenched
hands
flashing
eyes
and
beard
that
bristled
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
and
presently
burgess
eyes
fell
before
those
of
the
chaplain
miserable
blasphemer
says
north
i
tell
you
that
you
shall
not
flog
the
burgess
white
with
rage
rang
the
bell
that
summoned
his
convict
servant
show
north
out
he
said
and
go
down
to
the
barracks
and
tell
troke
that
kirkland

have
a
hundred
lashes
i
show
you
who

my
good

to
the
government
said
north
aghast

the
government

go
to
and
you
too
roared
burgess
get
out
and
god
viceregent
at
port
arthur
slammed
the
door
north
returned
home
in
great
agitation
they
shall
not
flog
that
boy
he
said
i
shield
him
with
my
own
body
if
necessary
i
report
this
to
the
government
i
see
sir
john
franklin
myself
i
have
the
light
of
day
let
into
this
den
of
he
reached
his
cottage
and
lighted
the
lamp
in
the
little
all
was
silent
save
that
from
the
adjoining
chamber
came
the
sound
of
meekin
gentlemanly
snore
north
took
down
a
book
from
the
shelf
and
tried
to
read
but
the
letters
ran
together
i
wish
i
had
taken
that
brandy
he
said
fool
that
i
then
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
to
fling
himself
on
the
sofa
to
read
to
pray
oh
god
give
me
strength
aid
me
help
me
i
struggle
but
i
am
weak
o
lord
look
down
upon
me
to
see
him
rolling
on
the
sofa
in
agony
to
see
his
white
face
his
parched
lips
and
his
contracted
brow
to
hear
his
moans
and
muttered
prayers
one
would
have
thought
him
suffering
from
the
pangs
of
some
terrible
disease
he
opened
the
book
again
and
forced
himself
to
read
but
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
cupboard
there
lurked
something
that
fascinated
him
he
got
up
at
length
went
into
the
kitchen
and
found
a
packet
of
red
pepper
he
mixed
a
teaspoonful
of
this
in
a
pannikin
of
water
and
drank
it
it
relieved
him
for
a
while
i
must
keep
my
wits
for
the
life
of
that
lad
depends
upon
it
meekin
too
will
suspect
i
will
lie
he
went
into
his
bedroom
and
flung
himself
on
the
bed
but
only
to
toss
from
side
to
side
in
vain
he
repeated
texts
of
scripture
and
scraps
of
verse
in
vain
counted
imaginary
sheep
or
listened
to
imaginary
sleep
would
not
come
to
him
it
was
as
though
he
had
reached
the
crisis
of
a
disease
which
had
been
for
days
gathering
force
i
must
have
a
teaspoonful
he
said
to
allay
the
twice
he
paused
on
the
way
to
the
and
twice
was
he
driven
on
by
a
power
stronger
than
his
will
he
reached
it
at
length
and
opening
the
cupboard
pulled
out
what
he
sought
a
bottle
of
brandy
with
this
in
his
hand
all
moderation
vanished
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
eagerly
drank
then
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
he
thrust
the
bottle
back
and
made
for
his
room
still
he
could
not
sleep
the
taste
of
the
liquor
maddened
him
for
more
he
saw
in
the
darkness
the
brandy
bottle
vulgar
and
terrible
apparition
he
saw
its
amber
fluid
sparkle
he
heard
it
gurgle
as
he
poured
it
out
he
smelt
the
nutty
aroma
of
the
spirit
he
pictured
it
standing
in
the
corner
of
the
cupboard
and
imagined
himself
seizing
it
and
quenching
the
fire
that
burned
within
him
he
wept
he
prayed
he
fought
with
his
desire
as
with
a
madness
he
told
himself
that
another
life
depended
on
his
exertions
that
to
give
way
to
his
fatal
passion
was
unworthy
of
an
educated
man
and
a
reasoning
being
that
it
was
degrading
disgusting
and
bestial
that
at
all
times
debasing
at
this
particular
time
it
was
infamous
that
a
vice
unworthy
of
any
man
was
doubly
sinful
in
a
man
of
education
and
a
minister
of
god
in
vain
in
the
midst
of
his
arguments
he
found
himself
at
the
cupboard
with
the
bottle
at
his
lips
in
an
attitude
that
was
at
once
ludicrous
and
horrible
he
had
no
cancer
his
disease
was
a
more
terrible
one
the
reverend
james
north
gentleman
scholar
and
christian
priest
was
what
the
world
calls
a
confirmed
drunkard
chapter
xv
one
hundred
lashes
the
morning
sun
bright
and
fierce
looked
down
upon
a
curious
sight
in
a
was
a
little
group
of
persons
troke
burgess
macklewain
kirkland
and
rufus
dawes
three
wooden
staves
seven
feet
high
were
fastened
together
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
the
structure
looked
not
unlike
that
made
by
gypsies
to
boil
their
kettles
to
this
structure
kirkland
was
bound
his
feet
were
fastened
with
thongs
to
the
base
of
the
triangle
his
wrists
bound
above
his
head
at
the
apex
his
body
was
then
extended
to
its
fullest
length
and
his
white
back
shone
in
the
sunlight
during
his
tying
up
he
had
said
nothing
only
when
troke
pulled
off
his
shirt
he
shivered
now
prisoner
said
troke
to
dawes
do
your
rufus
dawes
looked
from
the
three
stern
faces
to
kirkland
white
back
and
his
face
grew
purple
in
all
his
experience
he
had
never
been
asked
to
flog
before
he
had
been
flogged
often
enough
you
do
want
me
to
flog
him
sir
he
said
to
the
commandant
pick
up
the
cat
sir
said
burgess
astonished
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
rufus
dawes
picked
up
the
heavy
cat
and
drew
its
knotted
lashes
between
his
fingers
go
on
dawes
whispered
kirkland
without
turning
his
head
you
are
no
more
than
another
what
does
he
say
asked
burgess
telling
him
to
cut
light
sir
said
troke
eagerly
lying
they
all
do
cut
light
eh
we
see
about
that
get
on
my
man
and
look
sharp
or
i
tie
you
up
and
give
you
fifty
for
yourself
as
sure
as
god
made
little
go
on
dawes
whispered
kirkland
again
i
do
rufus
dawes
lifted
the
cat
swung
it
round
his
head
and
brought
its
knotted
cords
down
upon
the
white
back
wonn
cried
troke
the
white
back
was
instantly
striped
with
six
crimson
bars
kirkland
stifled
a
cry
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
cut
in
half
now
then
you
scoundrel
roared
burgess
separate
your
cats
what
do
you
mean
by
flogging
a
man
that
fashion
rufus
dawes
drew
his
crooked
fingers
through
the
entangled
cords
and
struck
again
this
time
the
blow
was
more
effective
and
the
blood
beaded
on
the
skin
the
boy
did
not
cry
but
macklewain
saw
his
hands
clutch
the
staves
tightly
and
the
muscles
of
his
naked
arms
quiver
tew
that
better
said
burgess
the
third
blow
sounded
as
though
it
had
been
struck
upon
a
piece
of
raw
beef
and
the
crimson
turned
purple
my
god
said
kirkland
faintly
and
bit
his
lips
the
flogging
proceeded
in
silence
for
ten
strikes
and
then
kirkland
gave
a
screech
like
a
wounded
horse
oh
captain
burgess
dawes
mr
troke
oh
my
god
oh
oh
mercy
oh
doctor
mr
north
oh
oh
oh
ten
cried
troke
impassively
counting
to
the
end
of
the
first
twenty
the
lad
back
swollen
into
a
lump
now
presented
the
appearance
of
a
ripe
peach
which
a
wilful
child
had
scored
with
a
pin
dawes
turning
away
from
his
bloody
handiwork
drew
the
cats
through
his
fingers
twice
they
were
beginning
to
get
clogged
a
little
go
on
said
burgess
with
a
nod
and
troke
cried
wonn
again
roused
by
the
morning
sun
streaming
in
upon
him
north
opened
his
bloodshot
eyes
rubbed
his
forehead
with
hands
that
trembled
and
suddenly
awakening
to
a
consciousness
of
his
promised
errand
rolled
off
the
bed
and
rose
to
his
feet
he
saw
the
empty
brandy
bottle
on
his
wooden
and
remembered
what
had
passed
with
shaking
hands
he
dashed
water
over
his
aching
head
and
smoothed
his
garments
the
debauch
of
the
previous
night
had
left
the
usual
effects
behind
it
his
brain
seemed
on
fire
his
hands
were
hot
and
dry
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
shuddered
as
he
viewed
his
pale
face
and
red
eyes
in
the
little
and
hastily
tried
the
door
he
had
retained
sufficient
sense
in
his
madness
to
lock
it
and
his
condition
had
been
unobserved
stealing
into
the
he
saw
that
the
clock
pointed
to
six
the
flogging
was
to
have
taken
place
at
five
unless
accident
had
favoured
him
he
was
already
too
late
fevered
with
remorse
and
anxiety
he
hurried
past
the
room
where
meekin
yet
slumbered
and
made
his
way
to
the
prison
as
he
entered
the
yard
troke
called
ten
kirkland
had
just
got
his
fiftieth
lash
stop
cried
north
captain
burgess
i
call
upon
you
to
you
rather
late
north
retorted
burgess
the
punishment
is
nearly
wonn
cried
troke
again
and
north
stood
by
biting
his
nails
and
grinding
his
teeth
during
six
more
lashes
kirkland
ceased
to
yell
now
and
merely
moaned
his
back
was
like
a
bloody
sponge
while
in
the
interval
between
lashes
the
swollen
flesh
twitched
like
that
of
a
bullock
suddenly
macklewain
saw
his
head
droop
on
his
shoulder
throw
him
off
throw
him
off
he
cried
and
troke
hurried
to
loosen
the
thongs
fling
some
water
over
him
said
burgess
he
a
bucket
of
water
made
kirkland
open
his
eyes
i
thought
so
said
burgess
tie
him
up
no
not
if
you
are
christians
cried
north
he
met
with
an
ally
where
he
least
expected
one
rufus
dawes
flung
down
the
dripping
cat
i
flog
no
more
said
he
what
roared
burgess
furious
at
this
gross
insolence
i
flog
no
more

someone
else
to
do
your
blood
work
for
you

burgess

and
he
shall
look
on
while
his
back
rufus
dawes
with
a
glance
at
north
pulled
off
his
shirt
without
a
word
and
stretched
himself
at
the
triangles
his
back
was
not
white
and
smooth
like
kirkland
had
been
but
hard
and
seamed
he
had
been
flogged
before
troke
appeared
with
gabbett
grinning
gabbett
liked
flogging
it
was
his
boast
that
he
could
flog
a
man
to
death
on
a
place
no
bigger
than
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
could
use
his
left
hand
equally
with
his
right
and
if
he
got
hold
of
a
favourite
would
cross
the
cuts
rufus
dawes
planted
his
feet
firmly
on
the
ground
took
fierce
grasp
on
the
staves
and
drew
in
his
breath
macklewain
spread
the
garments
of
the
two
men
upon
the
ground
and
placing
kirkland
upon
them
turned
to
watch
this
new
phase
in
the
morning
amusement
he
grumbled
a
little
below
his
breath
for
he
wanted
his
breakfast
and
when
the
commandant
once
began
to
flog
there
was
no
telling
where
he
would
stop
rufus
dawes
took
lashes
without
a
murmur
and
then
gabbett
crossed
the
cuts
this
went
on
up
to
fifty
lashes
and
north
felt
himself
stricken
with
admiration
at
the
courage
of
the
man
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
cursed
brandy
thought
he
with
bitterness
of
i
might
have
saved
all
at
the
hundredth
lash
the
giant
paused
expecting
the
order
to
throw
off
but
burgess
was
determined
to
break
the
man
spirit
i
make
you
speak
you
dog
if
i
cut
your
heart
out
he
cried
go
on
for
twenty
lashes
more
dawes
was
mute
and
then
the
agony
forced
from
his
labouring
breast
a
hideous
cry
but
it
was
not
a
cry
for
mercy
as
that
of
kirkland
had
been
having
found
his
tongue
the
wretched
man
gave
vent
to
his
boiling
passion
in
a
torrent
of
curses
he
shrieked
imprecation
upon
burgess
troke
and
north
he
cursed
all
soldiers
for
tyrants
all
parsons
for
hypocrites
he
blasphemed
his
god
and
his
saviour
with
a
frightful
outpouring
of
obscenity
and
blasphemy
he
called
on
the
earth
to
gape
and
swallow
his
persecutors
for
heaven
to
open
and
rain
fire
upon
them
for
hell
to
yawn
and
engulf
them
quick
it
was
as
though
each
blow
of
the
cat
forced
out
of
him
a
fresh
burst
of
rage
he
seemed
to
have
abandoned
his
humanity
he
foamed
he
raved
he
tugged
at
his
bonds
until
the
strong
staves
shook
again
he
writhed
himself
round
upon
the
triangles
and
spat
impotently
at
burgess
who
jeered
at
his
torments
north
with
his
hands
to
his
ears
crouched
against
the
corner
of
the
wall
palsied
with
horror
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
passions
of
hell
raged
around
him
he
would
fain
have
fled
but
a
horrible
fascination
held
him
back
in
the
midst
of
this
when
the
cat
was
hissing
its
loudest
burgess
laughing
his
hardest
and
the
wretch
on
the
triangles
filling
the
air
with
his
cries
north
saw
kirkland
look
at
him
with
what
he
thought
a
smile
was
it
a
smile
he
leapt
forward
and
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
so
loud
that
all
turned
hullo
says
troke
running
to
the
heap
of
clothes
the
young
slipped
his
wind
kirkland
was
dead
throw
him
off
says
burgess
aghast
at
the
unfortunate
accident
and
gabbett
reluctantly
untied
the
thongs
that
bound
rufus
dawes
two
constables
were
alongside
him
in
an
instant
for
sometimes
newly
tortured
men
grew
desperate
this
one
however
was
silent
with
the
last
lash
only
in
taking
his
shirt
from
under
the
body
of
the
boy
he
muttered
dead
and
in
his
tone
there
seemed
to
be
a
touch
of
envy
then
flinging
his
shirt
over
his
bleeding
shoulders
he
walked
out
defiant
to
the
last
game
ai
he
said
one
constable
to
the
other
as
they
pushed
him
not
ungently
into
an
empty
cell
there
to
wait
for
the
hospital
guard
the
body
of
kirkland
was
taken
away
in
silence
and
burgess
turned
rather
pale
when
he
saw
north
threatening
face
it
is
my
fault
north
he
said
i
did
know
that
the
lad
was
but
north
turned
away
in
disgust
and
macklewain
and
burgess
pursued
their
homeward
route
together
strange
that
he
should
drop
like
that
said
the
commandant
yes
unless
he
had
any
internal
disease
said
the
surgeon
disease
of
the
heart
for
instance
said
burgess
i
him
and
come
in
and
have
a
nip
macklewain
i
feel
quite
qualmish
said
burgess
and
the
two
went
into
the
house
amid
respectful
salutes
from
either
side
north
in
agony
of
mind
at
what
he
considered
the
consequence
of
his
neglect
slowly
and
with
head
bowed
down
as
one
bent
on
a
painful
errand
went
to
see
the
prisoner
who
had
survived
he
found
him
kneeling
on
the
ground
prostrated
rufus
at
the
low
tone
rufus
dawes
looked
up
and
seeing
who
it
was
waved
him
off
do
speak
to
me
he
said
with
an
imprecation
that
made
flesh
creep
i
told
you
what
i
think
of
you
a
hypocrite
who
stands
by
while
a
man
is
cut
to
pieces
and
then
comes
and
whines
religion
to
north
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
cell
with
his
arms
hanging
down
and
his
head
bent
you
are
right
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
must
seem
to
you
a
hypocrite
i
a
servant
of
christ
a
besotted
beast
rather
i
am
not
come
to
whine
religion
to
you
i
am
come
to
to
ask
your
pardon
i
might
have
saved
you
from
punishment
saved
that
poor
boy
from
death
i
wanted
to
save
him
god
knows
but
i
have
a
vice
i
am
a
drunkard
i
yielded
to
my
temptation
and
i
was
too
late
i
come
to
you
as
one
sinful
man
to
another
to
ask
you
to
forgive
and
north
suddenly
flung
himself
down
beside
the
convict
and
catching
his
hands
in
his
own
cried
forgive
me
brother
rufus
dawes
too
much
astonished
to
speak
bent
his
black
eyes
upon
the
man
who
crouched
at
his
feet
and
a
ray
of
divine
pity
penetrated
his
gloomy
soul
he
seemed
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
misery
more
profound
than
his
own
and
his
stubborn
heart
felt
human
sympathy
with
this
erring
brother
then
in
this
hell
there
is
yet
a
man
said
he
and
a
passed
between
these
two
unhappy
beings
north
arose
and
with
averted
face
passed
quickly
from
the
cell
rufus
dawes
looked
at
his
hand
which
his
strange
visitor
had
taken
and
something
glittered
there
it
was
a
tear
he
broke
down
at
the
sight
of
it
and
when
the
guard
came
to
fetch
the
tameless
convict
they
found
him
on
his
knees
in
a
corner
sobbing
like
a
child
chapter

kicking
against
the
pricks
the
morning
after
this
the
rev
north
departed
in
the
schooner
for
hobart
town
between
the
officious
chaplain
and
the
commandant
the
events
of
the
previous
day
had
fixed
a
great
gulf
burgess
knew
that
north
meant
to
report
the
death
of
kirkland
and
guessed
that
he
would
not
be
backward
in
relating
the
story
to
such
persons
in
hobart
town
as
would
most
readily
repeat
it
blank
awkward
the
fellow
dying
he
confessed
to
himself
if
he
had
died
nobody
would
have
bothered
about
a
sinister
truth
north
on
the
other
hand
comforted
himself
with
the
belief
that
the
fact
of
the
convict
death
under
the
lash
would
cause
indignation
and
subsequent
inquiry
the
truth
must
come
out
if
they
only
ask
thought
he
north
four
years
a
government
chaplain
and
not
yet
attained
to
a
knowledge
of
a
government
method
of
asking
about
such
matters
kirkland
mangled
flesh
would
have
fed
the
worms
before
the
ink
on
the
last
minute
from
deliberating
authority
was
dry
burgess
however
touched
with
selfish
regrets
determined
to
baulk
the
parson
at
the
outset
he
would
send
down
an
official
return
of
the
unfortunate
occurrence
by
the
same
vessel
that
carried
his
enemy
and
thus
get
the
ear
of
the
office
meekin
walking
on
the
evening
of
the
flogging
past
the
wooden
shed
where
the
body
lay
saw
troke
bearing
buckets
filled
with
water
and
heard
a
great
splashing
and
sluicing
going
on
inside
the
hut
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
doctor
bin
the
prisoner
what
was
flogged
this
morning
sir
said
troke
and
we
cleanin
meekin
sickened
and
walked
on
he
had
heard
that
unhappy
kirkland
possessed
unknown
disease
of
the
heart
and
had
unhappily
died
before
receiving
his
allotted
punishment
his
duty
was
to
comfort
soul
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
kirkland
slovenly
unhandsome
body
and
so
he
went
for
a
walk
on
the
pier
that
the
breeze
might
blow
his
momentary
sickness
away
from
him
on
the
pier
he
saw
north
talking
to
father
flaherty
the
roman
catholic
chaplain
meekin
had
been
taught
to
look
upon
a
priest
as
a
shepherd
might
look
upon
a
wolf
and
passed
with
a
distant
bow
the
pair
were
apparently
talking
on
the
occurrence
of
the
morning
for
he
heard
father
flaherty
say
with
a
shrug
of
his
round
shoulders
he
woas
not
one
of
moi
people
north
and
the
govermint
would
not
suffer
me
to
interfere
with
matters
relating
to
prhotestint
the
wretched
creature
was
a
protestant
thought
meekin
at
least
then
his
immortal
soul
was
not
endangered
by
belief
in
the
damnable
heresies
of
the
church
of
so
he
passed
on
giving
denis
flaherty
the
son
of
the
of
kildrum
a
wide
berth
and
lest
he
should
pounce
down
upon
him
unawares
and
with
jesuitical
argument
and
silken
softness
of
speech
convert
him
by
force
to
his
own
state
of
error
as
was
the
custom
of
those
intellectual
gladiators
the
priests
of
the
catholic
faith
north
on
his
side
left
flaherty
with
regret
he
had
spent
many
a
pleasant
hour
with
him
and
knew
him
for
a
conscientious
yet
creature
whose
god
was
neither
his
belly
nor
his
breviary
but
sometimes
in
one
place
and
sometimes
in
the
other
according
to
the
hour
of
the
day
and
the
fasts
appointed
for
due
mortification
of
the
flesh
a
man
who
would
do
christian
work
in
a
parish
or
where
men
lived
too
easily
to
sin
harshly
but
utterly
unfit
to
cope
with
satan
as
the
british
government
had
transported
him
was
north
sadly
satirical
reflection
upon
father
flaherty
as
port
arthur
faded
into
indistinct
beauty
behind
the
schooner
god
help
those
poor
villains
for
neither
parson
nor
priest
he
was
right
north
the
drunkard
and
had
a
power
for
good
of
which
meekin
and
the
other
knew
nothing
not
merely
were
the
men
incompetent
and
but
they
understood
nothing
of
that
frightful
capacity
for
agony
which
is
deep
in
the
soul
of
every
they
might
strike
the
rock
as
they
chose
with
pick
of
warranted
gospel
manufacture
stamped
with
the
approval
of
eminent
divines
of
all
ages
but
the
water
of
repentance
and
remorse
would
not
gush
for
them
they
possessed
not
the
frail
rod
which
alone
was
powerful
to
charm
they
had
no
sympathy
no
knowledge
no
experience
he
who
would
touch
the
hearts
of
men
must
have
had
his
own
heart
seared
the
missionaries
of
mankind
have
ever
been
great
sinners
before
they
earned
the
divine
right
to
heal
and
bless
their
weakness
was
made
their
strength
and
out
of
their
own
agony
of
repentance
came
the
knowledge
which
made
them
masters
and
saviours
of
their
kind
it
was
the
agony
of
the
garden
and
the
cross
that
gave
to
the
world
preacher
his
kingdom
in
the
hearts
of
men
the
crown
of
divinity
is
a
crown
of
thorns
north
on
his
arrival
went
straight
to
the
house
of
major
vickers
i
have
a
complaint
to
make
sir
he
said
i
wish
to
lodge
it
formally
with
you
a
prisoner
has
been
flogged
to
death
at
port
arthur
i
saw
it
vickers
bent
his
brow
a
serious
accusation
north
i
must
of
course
receive
it
with
respect
coming
from
you
but
i
trust
that
you
have
fully
considered
the
circumstances
of
the
case
i
always
understood
captain
burgess
was
a
most
humane
north
shook
his
head
he
would
not
accuse
burgess
he
would
let
the
events
speak
for
themselves
i
only
ask
for
an
inquiry
said
he
yes
my
dear
sir
i
know
very
proper
indeed
on
your
part
if
you
think
any
injustice
has
been
done
but
have
you
considered
the
expense
the
delay
the
immense
trouble
and
dissatisfaction
all
this
will
give
no
trouble
no
expense
no
dissatisfaction
should
stand
in
the
way
of
humanity
and
justice
cried
north
of
course
not
but
will
justice
be
done
are
you
sure
you
can
prove
your
case
mind
i
admit
nothing
against
captain
burgess
whom
i
have
always
considered
a
most
worthy
and
zealous
officer
but
supposing
your
charge
to
be
true
can
you
prove
it
yes
if
the
witnesses
speak
the
who
are
they
myself
macklewain
the
constable
and
two
prisoners
one
of
whom
was
flogged
himself
he
will
speak
the
truth
i
believe
the
other
man
i
have
not
much
faith
very
well
then
there
is
only
a
prisoner
and
macklewain
for
if
there
has
been
foul
play
the
will
not
accuse
the
authorities
moreover
the
doctor
does
not
agree
with
no
cried
north
amazed
no
you
see
then
my
dear
sir
how
necessary
it
is
not
to
be
hasty
in
matters
of
this
kind
i
really
think
pardon
me
for
my
plainness
that
your
goodness
of
heart
has
misled
you
captain
burgess
sends
a
report
of
the
case
he
says
the
man
was
sentenced
to
a
hundred
lashes
for
gross
insolence
and
disobedience
of
orders
that
the
doctor
was
present
during
the
punishment
and
that
the
man
was
thrown
off
by
his
directions
after
he
had
received
lashes
that
after
a
short
interval
he
was
found
to
be
dead
and
that
the
doctor
made
a
examination
and
found
disease
of
the
north
started
a
i
never
knew
there
had
been
one
here
is
the
medical
certificate
said
vickers
holding
it
out
accompanied
by
the
copies
of
the
evidence
of
the
constable
and
a
letter
from
the
poor
north
took
the
papers
and
read
them
slowly
they
were
apparently
straightforward
enough
aneurism
of
the
ascending
aorta
was
given
as
the
cause
of
death
and
the
doctor
frankly
admitted
that
had
he
known
the
deceased
to
be
suffering
from
that
complaint
he
would
not
have
permitted
him
to
receive
more
than
lashes
i
think
macklewain
is
an
honest
man
said
north
doubtfully
he
would
not
dare
to
return
a
false
certificate
yet
the
circumstances
of
the
case
the
horrible
condition
of
the
prisoners
the
frightful
story
of
that
boy
i
can
not
enter
into
these
questions
north
my
position
here
is
to
administer
the
law
to
the
best
of
my
ability
not
to
question
north
bowed
his
head
to
the
reproof
in
some
sort
of
justly
unjust
way
he
felt
that
he
deserved
it
i
can
say
no
more
sir
i
am
afraid
i
am
helpless
in
this
matter
as
i
have
been
in
others
i
see
that
the
evidence
is
against
me
but
it
is
my
duty
to
carry
my
efforts
as
far
as
i
can
and
i
will
do
vickers
bowed
stiffly
and
wished
him
good
morning
authority
however
in
private
life
has
in
its
official
capacity
a
natural
dislike
to
those
dissatisfied
persons
who
persist
in
pushing
inquiries
to
extremities
north
going
out
with
saddened
spirits
met
in
the
passage
a
beautiful
young
girl
it
was
sylvia
coming
to
visit
her
father
he
lifted
his
hat
and
looked
after
her
he
guessed
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
man
he
had
left
the
wife
of
the
captain
frere
concerning
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
north
was
a
man
whose
morbidly
excited
brain
was
prone
to
strange
fancies
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
beneath
the
clear
blue
eyes
that
flashed
upon
him
for
a
moment
lay
a
hint
of
future
sadness
in
which
in
some
strange
way
he

stared
after
her
figure
until
it
disappeared
and
long
after
the
dainty
presence
of
the
young
bride
trimly
booted
and
had
faded
with
all
its
sunshine
of
gaiety
and
health
from
out
of
his
mental
vision
he
still
saw
those
blue

captain

sylvia
had
become
the
wife
of
maurice
frere
the
wedding
created
excitement
in
the
convict
settlement
for
maurice
frere
though
oppressed
by
the
secret
shame
at
open
matrimony
which
affects
men
of
his
character
could
not
in
decency
seeing
how
good
a
thing
for
him
was
this
wealthy
alliance
demand
unceremonious
nuptials
so
after
the
fashion
of
the
town
there
being
no
continent
or
scotland
adjacent
as
a
hiding
place
for
bridal
blushes
the
alliance
was
entered
into
with

pomp
of
ball
and
supper
bride
and
bridegroom
departing
through
the
golden
afternoon
to
the
nearest
of
major

stations
thence
it
had
been
arranged
they
should
return
after
a
fortnight
and
take
ship
for
sydney
major
vickers
affectionate
though
he
was
to
the
man
whom
he
believed
to
be
the
saviour
of
his
child
had
no
notion
of
allowing
him
to
live
on
sylvia
fortune
he
had
settled
his
daughter
portion
ten
thousand
pounds
upon
herself
and
children
and
had
informed
frere
that
he
expected
him
to
live
upon
an
income
of
his
own
earning
after
many
consultations
between
the
pair
it
had
been
arranged
that
a
civil
appointment
in
sydney
would
best
suit
the
bridegroom
who
was
to
sell
out
of
the
service
this
notion
was
frere
own
he
never
cared
for
military
duty
and
had
moreover
private
debts
to
no
inconsiderable
amount
by
selling
his
commission
he
would
be
enabled
at
once
to
pay
these
debts
and
render
himself
eligible
for
any
post
under
the
colonial
government
that
the
interest
of
his
and
his
own
reputation
as
a
convict
disciplinarian
might
procure
vickers
would
fain
have
kept
his
daughter
with
him
but
he
unselfishly
acquiesced
in
the
scheme
admitting
that
frere
plea
as
to
the
comforts
she
would
derive
from
the
society
to
be
found
in
sydney
was
a
valid
one
you
can
come
over
and
see
us
when
we
get
settled
papa
said
sylvia
with
a
young
matron
pride
of
place
and
we
can
come
and
see
you
hobart
town
is
very
pretty
but
i
want
to
see
the
you
should
go
to
london
poppet
said
maurice
that
the
place
is
it
sir
oh
london
cries
sylvia
clapping
her
hands
and
westminster
abbey
and
the
tower
and
james
palace
and
hyde
park
and
said
johnson
us
take
a
walk
down
do
you
remember
in
croker
book
maurice
no
you
do
i
know
because
you
only
looked
at
the
pictures
and
then
read
pierce
egan
account
of
the
topping
fight
between
bob
gaynor
and
ned
neal
or
some
such
little
girls
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
said
maurice
between
a
laugh
and
a
blush
you
have
no
business
to
read
my
why
not
she
asked
with
a
gaiety
which
already
seemed
a
little
strained
husband
and
wife
should
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
sir
besides
i
want
you
to
read
my
books
i
am
going
to
read
shelley
to
do
my
dear
said
maurice
simply
i
ca
understand
this
little
scene
took
place
at
the
of
frere
cottage
in
new
town
to
which
major
vickers
had
been
invited
in
order
that
future
plans
might
be
discussed
i
do
want
to
go
to
port
arthur
said
the
bride
later
in
the
evening
maurice
there
can
be
no
necessity
to
go
well
said
maurice
i
want
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
i
ought
to
be
familiar
with
all
phases
of
convict
discipline
you
there
is
likely
to
be
a
report
ordered
upon
the
death
of
a
prisoner
said
vickers
the
chaplain
a
fussy
but
person
has
been
memorializing
about
it
you
may
as
well
do
it
as
anybody
else
ay
and
save
the
expenses
of
the
trip
said
maurice
but
it
is
so
melancholy
cried
sylvia
the
most
delightful
place
in
the
island
my
dear
i
was
there
for
a
few
days
once
and
i
really
was
it
was
remarkable
so
vickers
thought
how
each
of
these
ones
had
caught
something
of
the
other
manner
of
speech
sylvia
was
less
choice
in
her
mode
of
utterance
frere
more
so
he
caught
himself
wondering
which
of
the
two
methods
both
would
finally
adopt
but
those
dogs
and
sharks
and
things
oh
maurice
have
we
had
enough
of
convicts
enough
why
i
going
to
make
my
living
out
of
said
maurice
with
his
most
natural
manner
sylvia
sighed
play
something
darling
said
her
father
and
so
the
girl
sitting
down
to
the
piano
trilled
and
warbled
in
her
pure
young
voice
until
the
port
arthur
question
floated
itself
away
upon
waves
of
melody
and
was
heard
of
no
more
for
that
time
but
upon
pursuing
the
subject
sylvia
found
her
husband
firm
he
wanted
to
go
and
he
would
go
having
once
assured
himself
that
it
was
advantageous
to
him
to
do
a
certain
thing
the
native
obstinacy
of
the
animal
urged
him
to
do
it
despite
all
opposition
from
others
and
sylvia
having
had
her
first
cry
over
the
question
of
the
visit
gave
up
the
point
this
was
the
first
difference
of
their
short
married
life
and
she
hastened
to
condone
it
in
the
sunshine
of
love
and
marriage
for
maurice
at
first
really
loved
her
and
love
curbing
the
worst
part
of
him
brought
to
him
as
it
brings
to
all
of
us
that
gentleness
and
abnegation
of
self
which
is
the
only
token
and
assurance
of
a
love
aught
but
animal
sylvia
fears
and
doubts
melted
away
as
the
mists
melt
in
the
beams
of
morning
a
young
girl
with
passionate
fancy
with
honest
and
noble
aspiration
but
with
the
dark
shadow
of
her
early
mental
sickness
brooding
upon
her
childlike
nature
marriage
made
her
a
woman
by
developing
in
her
a
woman
trust
and
pride
in
the
man
to
whom
she
had
voluntarily
given
herself
yet
out
of
this
sentiment
arose
a
new
and
strange
source
of
anxiety
having
accepted
her
position
as
a
wife
and
put
away
from
her
all
doubts
as
to
her
own
capacity
for
loving
the
man
to
whom
she
had
allied
herself
she
began
to
be
haunted
by
a
dread
lest
he
might
do
something
which
would
lessen
the
affection
she
bore
him
on
one
or
two
occasions
she
had
been
forced
to
confess
that
her
husband
was
more
of
an
egotist
than
she
cared
to
think
he
demanded
of
her
no
great
sacrifices
had
he
done
so
she
would
have
found
in
making
them
the
pleasure
that
women
of
her
nature
always
find
in
such
but
he
now
and
then
intruded
on
her
that
disregard
for
the
feeling
of
others
which
was
part
of
his
character
he
was
fond
of
her
almost
too
passionately
fond
for
her
staider
liking
but
he
was
unused
to
thwart
his
own
will
in
anything
least
of
all
in
those
seeming
trifles
for
the
consideration
of
which
true
selfishness
bethinks
itself
did
she
want
to
read
when
he
wanted
to
walk
he
put
aside
her
book
with
an
assumption
that
a
walk
with
him
must
of
necessity
be
the
most
pleasing
thing
in
the
world
did
she
want
to
walk
when
he
wanted
to
rest
he
laughingly
set
up
his
laziness
as
an
plea
for
her
remaining
within
doors
he
was
at
no
pains
to
conceal
his
weariness
when
she
read
her
favourite
books
to
him
if
he
felt
sleepy
when
she
sang
or
played
he
slept
without
apology
if
she
talked
about
a
subject
in
which
he
took
no
interest
he
turned
the
conversation
remorselessly
he
would
not
have
wittingly
offended
her
but
it
seemed
to
him
natural
to
yawn
when
he
was
weary
to
sleep
when
he
was
fatigued
and
to
talk
only
about
those
subjects
which
interested
him
had
anybody
told
him
that
he
was
selfish
he
would
have
been
astonished
thus
it
came
about
that
sylvia
one
day
discovered
that
she
led
two
lives
one
in
the
body
and
one
in
the
spirit
and
that
with
her
spiritual
existence
her
husband
had
no
share
this
discovery
alarmed
her
but
then
she
smiled
at
it
as
if
maurice
could
be
expected
to
take
interest
in
all
my
silly
fancies
said
she
and
despite
a
harassing
thought
that
these
same
fancies
were
not
foolish
but
were
the
best
and
brightest
portion
of
her
she
succeeded
in
overcoming
her
uneasiness
a
man
thoughts
are
different
from
a
woman
she
said
he
has
his
business
and
his
worldly
cares
of
which
a
woman
knows
nothing
i
must
comfort
him
and
not
worry
him
with
my
as
for
maurice
he
grew
sometimes
rather
troubled
in
his
mind
he
could
not
understand
his
wife
her
nature
was
an
enigma
to
him
her
mind
was
a
puzzle
which
would
not
be
pieced
together
with
the
rectangular
correctness
of
ordinary
life
he
had
known
her
from
a
child
had
loved
her
from
a
child
and
had
committed
a
mean
and
cruel
crime
to
obtain
her
but
having
got
her
he
was
no
nearer
to
the
mystery
of
her
than
before
she
was
all
his
own
he
thought
her
golden
hair
was
for
his
fingers
her
lips
were
for
his
caress
her
eyes
looked
love
upon
him
alone
yet
there
were
times
when
her
lips
were
cold
to
his
kisses
and
her
eyes
looked
disdainfully
upon
his
coarser
passion
he
would
catch
her
musing
when
he
spoke
to
her
much
as
she
would
catch
him
sleeping
when
she
read
to
him
but
she
awoke
with
a
start
and
a
blush
at
her
forgetfulness
which
he
never
did
he
was
not
a
man
to
brood
over
these
things
and
after
some
reflective
pipes
and
ineffectual
rubbings
of
his
head
he
gave
it
up
how
was
it
possible
indeed
for
him
to
solve
the
mental
enigma
when
the
woman
herself
was
to
him
a
physical
riddle
it
was
extraordinary
that
the
child
he
had
seen
growing
up
by
his
side
day
by
day
should
be
a
young
woman
with
little
secrets
now
to
be
revealed
to
him
for
the
first
time
he
found
that
she
had
a
mole
on
her
neck
and
remembered
that
he
had
noticed
it
when
she
was
a
child
then
it
was
a
thing
of
no
moment
now
it
was
a
marvellous
discovery
he
was
in
daily
wonderment
at
the
treasure
he
had
obtained
he
marvelled
at
her
feminine
devices
of
dress
and
adornment
her
dainty
garments
seemed
to
him
perfumed
with
the
odour
of
sanctity
the
fact
was
that
the
patron
of
sarah
purfoy
had
not
met
with
many
virtuous
women
and
had
but
just
discovered
what
a
dainty
morsel
modesty
was
chapter
xviii
in
the
hospital
the
hospital
of
port
arthur
was
not
a
cheerful
place
but
to
the
tortured
and
unnerved
rufus
dawes
it
seemed
a
paradise
there
at
least
despite
the
roughness
and
contempt
with
which
his
gaolers
ministered
to
him
he
felt
that
he
was
considered
there
at
least
he
was
free
from
the
enforced
companionship
of
the
men
whom
he
loathed
and
to
whose
level
he
felt
with
mental
agony
unspeakable
that
he
was
daily
sinking
throughout
his
long
term
of
degradation
he
had
as
yet
aided
by
the
memory
of
his
sacrifice
and
his
love
preserved
something
of
his
but
he
felt
that
he
could
not
preserve
it
long
little
by
little
he
had
come
to
regard
himself
as
one
out
of
the
pale
of
love
and
mercy
as
one
tormented
of
fortune
plunged
into
a
deep
into
which
the
eye
of
heaven
did
not
penetrate
since
his
capture
in
the
garden
of
hobart
town
he
had
given
loose
rein
to
his
rage
and
his
despair
i
am
forgotten
or
despised
i
have
no
name
in
the
world
what
matter
if
i
become
like
one
of
these
it
was
under
the
influence
of
this
feeling
that
he
had
picked
up
the
cat
at
the
command
of
captain
burgess
as
the
unhappy
kirkland
had
said
as
well
you
as
another
and
truly
what
was
he
that
he
should
cherish
sentiments
of
honour
or
humanity
but
he
had
miscalculated
his
own
capacity
for
evil
as
he
flogged
he
blushed
and
when
he
flung
down
the
cat
and
stripped
his
own
back
for
punishment
he
felt
a
fierce
joy
in
the
thought
that
his
baseness
would
be
atoned
for
in
his
own
blood
even
when
unnerved
and
faint
from
the
hideous
ordeal
he
flung
himself
upon
his
knees
in
the
cell
he
regretted
only
the
impotent
ravings
that
the
torture
had
forced
from
him
he
could
have
bitten
out
his
tongue
for
his
blasphemous
utterings
not
because
they
were
blasphemous
but
because
their
utterance
by
revealing
his
agony
gave
their
triumph
to
his
tormentors
when
north
found
him
he
was
in
the
very
depth
of
this
abasement
and
he
repulsed
his
comforter
not
so
much
because
he
had
seen
him
flogged
as
because
he
had
heard
him
cry
the
and
force
of
will
which
had
hitherto
sustained
him
through
his
trial
had
failed
him
he
felt
at
the
moment
when
he
needed
it
most
and
the
man
who
had
with
unflinched
front
faced
the
gallows
the
desert
and
the
sea
confessed
his
debased
humanity
beneath
the
physical
torture
of
the
lash
he
had
been
flogged
before
and
had
wept
in
secret
at
his
degradation
but
he
now
for
the
first
time
comprehended
how
terrible
that
degradation
might
be
made
for
he
realized
how
the
agony
of
the
wretched
body
can
force
the
soul
to
quit
its
last
poor
refuge
of
assumed
indifference
and
confess
itself
conquered
not
many
months
before
one
of
the
companions
of
the
chain
suffering
under
burgess
tender
mercies
had
killed
his
mate
when
at
work
with
him
and
carrying
the
body
on
his
back
to
the
nearest
gang
had
surrendered
himself
going
to
his
death
thanking
god
he
had
at
last
found
a
way
of
escape
from
his
miseries
which
no
one
would
envy
him
save
his
comrades
the
heart
of
dawes
had
been
filled
with
horror
at
a
deed
so
bloody
and
he
had
with
others
commented
on
the
cowardice
of
the
man
that
would
thus
shirk
the
responsibility
of
that
state
of
life
in
which
it
had
pleased
man
and
the
devil
to
place
him
now
he
understood
how
and
why
the
crime
had
been
committed
and
felt
only
pity
lying
awake
with
back
that
burned
beneath
its
lotioned
rags
when
lights
were
low
in
the
breathful
silence
of
the
hospital
he
registered
in
his
heart
a
terrible
oath
that
he
would
die
ere
he
would
again
be
made
such
hideous
sport
for
his
enemies
in
this
frame
of
mind
with
such
shreds
of
honour
and
worth
as
had
formerly
clung
to
him
blown
away
in
the
whirlwind
of
his
passion
he
bethought
him
of
the
strange
man
who
had
deigned
to
clasp
his
hand
and
call
him
brother
he
had
wept
no
unmanly
tears
at
this
sudden
flow
of
tenderness
in
one
whom
he
had
thought
as
callous
as
the
rest
he
had
been
touched
with
wondrous
sympathy
at
the
confession
of
weakness
made
to
him
in
a
moment
when
his
own
weakness
had
overcome
him
to
his
shame
soothed
by
the
brief
rest
that
his
fortnight
of
hospital
seclusion
had
afforded
him
he
had
begun
in
a
languid
and
speculative
way
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
religion
he
had
read
of
martyrs
who
had
borne
agonies
unspeakable
upheld
by
their
confidence
in
heaven
and
god
in
his
old
wild
youth
he
had
scoffed
at
prayers
and
priests
in
the
hate
to
his
kind
that
had
grown
upon
him
with
his
later
years
he
had
despised
a
creed
that
told
men
to
love
one
another
god
is
love
my
brethren
said
the
chaplain
on
sundays
and
all
the
week
the
thongs
of
the
overseer
cracked
and
the
cat
hissed
and
swung
of
what
practical
value
was
a
piety
that
preached
but
did
not
practise
it
was
admirable
for
the
religious
instructor
to
tell
a
prisoner
that
he
must
not
give
way
to
evil
passions
but
must
bear
his
punishment
with
meekness
it
was
only
right
that
he
should
advise
him
to
put
his
trust
in
god
but
as
a
hardened
prisoner
convicted
of
getting
drunk
in
an
unlicensed
house
of
entertainment
had
said
god
terrible
far
from
port
rufus
dawes
had
smiled
at
the
spectacle
of
priests
admonishing
men
who
knew
what
he
knew
and
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
for
the
trivialities
of
lying
and
stealing
he
had
believed
all
priests
impostors
or
fools
all
religion
a
mockery
and
a
lie
but
now
finding
how
utterly
his
own
strength
had
failed
him
when
tried
by
the
rude
test
of
physical
pain
he
began
to
think
that
this
religion
which
was
talked
of
so
largely
was
not
a
mere
bundle
of
legend
and
formulae
but
must
have
in
it
something
vital
and
sustaining
broken
in
spirit
and
weakened
in
body
with
faith
in
his
own
will
shaken
he
longed
for
something
to
lean
upon
and
turned
as
all
men
turn
when
in
such
case
to
the
unknown
had
now
there
been
at
hand
some
christian
priest
some
man
even
no
matter
of
what
faith
to
pour
into
the
ears
of
this
poor
wretch
words
of
comfort
and
grace
to
rend
away
from
him
the
garment
of
sullenness
and
despair
in
which
he
had
wrapped
himself
to
drag
from
him
a
confession
of
his
unworthiness
his
obstinacy
and
his
hasty
judgment
and
to
cheer
his
fainting
soul
with
promise
of
immortality
and
justice
he
might
have
been
saved
from
his
after
fate
but
there
was
no
such
man
he
asked
for
the
chaplain
north
was
fighting
the
convict
department
seeking
vengeance
for
kirkland
and
victim
of
clerks
with
the
cold
spurt
of
the
pen
was
pushed
hither
and
thither
referred
here
snubbed
there
bowed
out
in
another
place
rufus
dawes
half
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
request
waited
a
long
morning
and
then
saw
respectfully
ushered
into
his
cell
as
his
soul
physician
meekin
chapter
xix
the
consolations
of
religion
well
my
good
man
said
meekin
soothingly
so
you
wanted
to
see
i
asked
for
the
chaplain
said
rufus
dawes
his
anger
with
himself
growing
apace
i
am
the
chaplain
returned
meekin
with
dignity
as
who
should
say
none
of
your
norths
but
a
respectable
chaplain
who
is
the
friend
of
a
bishop
i
thought
that
north
was
mr
north
has
left
sir
said
meekin
dryly
but
i
will
hear
what
you
have
to
say
there
is
no
occasion
to
go
constable
wait
outside
the
rufus
dawes
shifted
himself
on
the
wooden
bench
and
resting
his
back
against
the
wall
smiled
bitterly
do
be
afraid
sir
i
am
not
going
to
harm
you
he
said
i
only
wanted
to
talk
a
do
you
read
your
bible
dawes
asked
meekin
by
way
of
reply
it
would
be
better
to
read
your
bible
than
to
talk
i
think
you
must
humble
yourself
in
prayer
i
have
read
it
said
dawes
still
lying
back
and
watching
him
but
is
your
mind
softened
by
its
teachings
do
you
realize
the
infinite
mercy
of
god
who
has
compassion
dawes
upon
the
greatest
sinners
the
convict
made
a
move
of
impatience
the
old
sickening
barren
cant
of
piety
was
to
be
recommenced
then
he
came
asking
for
bread
and
they
gave
him
the
usual
stone
do
you
believe
that
there
is
a
god
meekin
abandoned
sinner
do
you
insult
a
clergyman
by
such
a
question
because
i
think
sometimes
that
if
there
is
he
must
often
be
dissatisfied
at
the
way
things
are
done
here
said
dawes
half
to
himself
i
can
listen
to
no
mutinous
observations
prisoner
said
meekin
do
not
add
blasphemy
to
your
other
crimes
i
fear
that
all
conversation
with
you
in
your
present
frame
of
mind
would
be
worse
than
useless
i
will
mark
a
few
passages
in
your
bible
that
seem
to
me
appropriate
to
your
condition
and
beg
you
to
commit
them
to
memory
hailes
the
door
if
you
so
with
a
bow
the
consoler
departed
rufus
dawes
felt
his
heart
grow
sick
north
had
gone
then
the
only
man
who
had
seemed
to
have
a
heart
in
his
bosom
had
gone
the
only
man
who
had
dared
to
clasp
his
horny
and
hand
and
call
him
brother
had
gone
turning
his
head
he
saw
through
the
window
wide
open
and
unbarred
for
nature
at
port
arthur
had
no
need
of
bars
the
lovely
bay
smooth
as
glass
glittering
in
the
afternoon
sun
the
long
quay
spotted
with
groups
of
and
heard
mingling
with
the
soft
murmur
of
the
waves
and
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
trees
the
clashing
of
irons
and
the
eternal
click
of
hammer
was
he
to
be
for
ever
buried
in
this
whitened
sepulchre
shut
out
from
the
face
of
heaven
and
mankind
the
appearance
of
hailes
broke
his
reverie
here
a
book
for
you
said
he
with
a
grin
parson
sent
rufus
dawes
took
the
bible
and
placing
it
on
his
knees
turned
to
the
places
indicated
by
slips
of
paper
embracing
some
twenty
marked
texts
parson
says
he
come
and
hear
you
and
you
to
keep
the
book
keep
the
book
clean
and
hear
him
did
meekin
think
that
he
was
a
charity
school
boy
the
utter
incapacity
of
the
chaplain
to
understand
his
wants
was
so
sublime
that
it
was
nearly
ridiculous
enough
to
make
him
laugh
he
turned
his
eyes
downwards
to
the
texts
good
meekin
in
the
fullness
of
his
stupidity
had
selected
the
fiercest
denunciations
of
bard
and
priest
the
most
notable
of
the
psalmist
curses
upon
his
enemies
the
most
furious
of
isaiah
ravings
anent
the
forgetfulness
of
the
national
worship
the
most
terrible
thunderings
of
apostle
and
evangelist
against
idolatry
and
unbelief
were
grouped
together
and
presented
to
dawes
to
soothe
him
all
the
material
horrors
of
faith
stripped
by
force
of
dissociation
from
the
context
of
all
poetic
feeling
and
local
colouring
were
launched
at
the
suffering
sinner
by
meekin
ignorant
hand
the
miserable
man
seeking
for
consolation
and
peace
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
bible
only
to
find
himself
threatened
with
the
pains
of
hell
the
worm
the
unquenchable
fire
the
bubbling
brimstone
the
bottomless
pit
from
out
of
which
the
smoke
of
his
torment
should
ascend
for
ever
and
ever
before
his
eyes
was
held
no
image
of
a
tender
saviour
with
hands
soft
to
soothe
and
eyes
brimming
with
ineffable
pity
dying
crucified
that
he
and
other
malefactors
might
have
hope
by
thinking
on
such
marvellous
humanity
the
worthy
pharisee
who
was
sent
to
him
to
teach
him
how
mankind
is
to
be
redeemed
with
love
preached
only
that
harsh
law
whose
barbarous
power
died
with
the
gentle
nazarene
on
calvary
repelled
by
this
ending
to
his
hopes
he
let
the
book
fall
to
the
ground
is
there
then
nothing
but
torment
for
me
in
this
world
or
the
next
he
groaned
shuddering
presently
his
eyes
sought
his
right
hand
resting
upon
it
as
though
it
were
not
his
own
or
had
some
secret
virtue
which
made
it
different
from
the
other
he
would
not
have
done
this
he
would
not
have
thrust
upon
me
these
savage
judgments
these
dreadful
threats
of
hell
and
death
he
called
me
and
filled
with
a
strange
wild
pity
for
himself
and
yearning
love
towards
the
man
who
befriended
him
he
fell
to
nursing
the
hand
on
which
tears
had
fallen
moaning
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
meekin
in
the
morning
found
his
pupil
more
sullen
than
ever
have
you
learned
these
texts
my
man
said
he
cheerfully
willing
not
to
be
angered
with
his
uncouth
and
unpromising
convert
rufus
dawes
pointed
with
his
foot
to
the
bible
which
still
lay
on
the
floor
as
he
had
left
it
the
night
before
no
no
why
not
i
would
learn
no
such
words
as
those
i
would
rather
forget
forget
them
my
good
man
i
rufus
dawes
sprang
up
in
sudden
wrath
and
pointing
to
his
cell
door
with
a
gesture
that
chained
and
degraded
as
he
was
had
something
of
dignity
in
it
cried
what
do
you
know
about
the
feelings
of
such
as
i
take
your
book
and
yourself
away
when
i
asked
for
a
priest
i
had
no
thought
of
you
begone
meekin
despite
the
halo
of
sanctity
which
he
felt
should
surround
him
found
his
gentility
melt
all
of
a
sudden
adventitious
distinctions
had
disappeared
for
the
instant
the
pair
had
become
simply
man
and
man
and
the
sleek
quailing
before
the
outraged
manhood
of
the
picked
up
his
bible
and
backed
out
that
man
dawes
is
very
insolent
said
the
insulted
chaplain
to
burgess
he
was
brutal
to
me
quite
was
he
said
burgess
had
too
long
a
spell
i
expect
i
send
him
back
to
work
it
would
be
well
said
meekin
if
he
had
some
chapter
xx
a
natural
the
employment
at
port
arthur
consisted
chiefly
of
agriculture
and
tanning
dawes
who
was
in
the
was
put
to
labour
that
is
to
say
bringing
down
logs
from
the
forest
or
lumbering
timber
on
the
wharf
this
work
was
not
light
an
ingenious
calculator
had
discovered
that
the
pressure
of
the
log
upon
the
shoulder
was
wont
to
average
lbs
members
of
the
were
dressed
in
yellow
and
by
way
of
encouraging
the
others
had
the
word
felon
stamped
upon
conspicuous
parts
of
their
raiment
this
was
the
sort
of
life
rufus
dawes
led
in
the
he
rose
at
five
in
the
morning
and
worked
until
six
in
the
evening
getting
of
an
hour
for
breakfast
and
one
hour
for
dinner
once
a
week
he
had
a
clean
shirt
and
once
a
fortnight
clean
socks
if
he
felt
sick
he
was
permitted
to
report
his
case
to
the
medical
officer
if
he
wanted
to
write
a
letter
he
could
ask
permission
of
the
commandant
and
send
the
letter
open
through
that
almighty
officer
who
could
stop
it
if
he
thought
necessary
if
he
felt
himself
aggrieved
by
any
order
he
was
to
obey
it
instantly
but
might
complain
afterwards
if
he
thought
fit
to
the
commandant
in
making
any
complaint
against
an
officer
or
constable
it
was
strictly
ordered
that
a
prisoner
must
be
most
respectful
in
his
manner
and
language
when
speaking
of
or
to
such
officer
or
constable
he
was
held
responsible
only
for
the
safety
of
his
chains
and
for
the
rest
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
gaoler
these
gaolers
owning
right
of
search
entry
into
cells
at
all
hours
and
other
droits
of
seigneury
were
responsible
only
to
the
commandant
who
was
responsible
only
to
the
governor
that
is
to
say
to
nobody
but
god
and
his
own
conscience
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commandant
included
the
whole
of
tasman
peninsula
with
the
islands
and
waters
within
three
miles
thereof
and
save
the
making
of
certain
returns
to
his
power
was
unlimited
a
word
as
to
the
position
and
appearance
of
this
place
of
punishment
tasman
peninsula
is
as
we
have
said
before
in
the
form
of
an
earring
with
a
double
drop
the
lower
drop
is
the
larger
and
is
ornamented
so
to
speak
with

its
southern
extremity

a
deep
indentation
called
maingon

east

the
purple

of

were
attracted
by
a
point

covered
with

swarming
with
life
this
was

the
place
of
confinement
for
boys
from
eight
to
twenty
years
of
age
it
was
astonishing
many
honest
folks
averred
how
ungrateful
were
these
juvenile
convicts
for
the
goods
the
government
had
provided
for
them
from

to

their
unchecked
force
the
isthmus

from
a
wild
and
terrible
into
whose
bowels
the
ravenous
sea
had
bored
strange
caverns
resonant
with
perpetual
roar
of
tortured
billows
at
one
spot
in
this
wilderness
the

penetrated
the

in
stormy

the
salt

rose
through
a
perpendicular

to
produce
their
penitents
in
good
case
burgess
was
in
high
spirits
at
finding
so
congenial
a
soul
selected
for
the
task
of
reporting
upon
him
it
only
a
nominal
thing
old
man
frere
said
to
his
former
comrade
when
they
met
that
parson
has
made
meddling
and
they
want
to
close
his
i
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
showing
you
and
frere
the
place
returned
burgess
i
must
try
and
make
your
stay
as
pleasant
as
i
can
though
i
afraid
that
frere
will
not
find
much
to
amuse
frankly
captain
burgess
said
sylvia
i
would
rather
have
gone
straight
to
sydney
my
husband
however
was
obliged
to
come
and
of
course
i
accompanied
you
will
not
have
much
society
said
meekin
who
was
of
the
welcoming
party
mrs
datchett
the
wife
of
one
of
our
stipendiaries
is
the
only
lady
here
and
i
hope
to
have
the
pleasure
of
making
you
acquainted
with
her
this
evening
at
the
commandant
mcnab
whom
you
know
is
in
command
at
the
neck
and
can
not
leave
or
you
would
have
seen
i
have
planned
a
little
party
said
burgess
but
i
fear
that
it
will
not
be
so
successful
as
i
could
you
wretched
old
bachelor
said
frere
you
should
get
married
like
ah
said
burgess
with
a
bow
that
would
be
sylvia
was
compelled
to
smile
at
the
compliment
made
in
the
presence
of
some
twenty
prisoners
who
were
carrying
the
various
trunks
and
packages
up
the
hill
and
she
remarked
that
the
said
prisoners
grinned
at
the
commandant
clumsy
courtesy
i
do
like
captain
burgess
maurice
she
said
in
the
interval
before
dinner
i
dare
say
he
did
flog
that
poor
fellow
to
death
he
looks
as
if
he
could
do
nonsense
said
maurice
pettishly
he
a
good
fellow
enough
besides
i
seen
the
doctor
certificate
it
a
story
i
ca
understand
your
absurd
sympathy
with
do
they
sometimes
deserve
sympathy
no
certainly
not
a
set
of
lying
scoundrels
you
are
always
whining
over
them
sylvia
i
do
like
it
and
i
told
you
before
about
sylvia
said
nothing
maurice
was
often
guilty
of
these
small
brutalities
and
she
had
learnt
that
the
best
way
to
meet
them
was
by
silence
unfortunately
silence
did
not
mean
indifference
for
the
reproof
was
unjust
and
nothing
stings
a
woman
fine
sense
like
an
injustice
burgess
had
prepared
a
feast
and
the
society
of
port
arthur
was
present
father
flaherty
meekin
doctor
macklewain
and
and
datchett
had
been
invited
and
the
was
resplendent
with
glass
and
flowers
i
a
fellow
who
was
a
professional
gardener
said
burgess
to
sylvia
during
the
dinner
and
i
make
use
of
his
we
have
a
professional
artist
also
said
macklewain
with
a
sort
of
pride
that
picture
of
the
of
chillon
yonder
was
painted
by
him
a
very
meritorious
production
is
it
not
i
got
the
place
full
of
curiosities
said
burgess
quite
a
collection
i
show
them
to
you
those
napkin
rings
were
made
by
a
ah
cried
frere
taking
up
the
bone
very
neat
that
is
some
of
rex
handiwork
said
meekin
he
is
very
clever
at
these
trifles
he
made
me
a
that
was
really
a
work
of
we
will
go
down
to
the
neck
or
next
day
frere
said
burgess
and
you
shall
see
the
it
is
a
curious
is
it
far
asked
sylvia
oh
no
we
shall
go
in
the
the
train
yes
do
look
so
astonished
you
see
it
oh
you
hobart
town
ladies
do
know
what
we
can
do
what
about
this
kirkland
business
frere
asked
i
suppose
i
can
have
half
an
hour
with
you
in
the
morning
and
take
the
depositions
any
time
you
like
my
dear
fellow
said
burgess
it
all
the
same
to
i
do
want
to
make
more
fuss
than
i
can
help
frere
said
apologetically
the
dinner
had
been
good
but
i
must
send
these
people
up
a
true
and
particular
do
you
of
course
cried
burgess
with
friendly
nonchalance
that
all
right
i
want
frere
to
see
point
where
the
boys
are
asked
sylvia
exactly
nearly
three
hundred
of
we
go
down
and
you
shall
be
my
witness
frere
as
to
the
way
they
are
indeed
said
sylvia
protesting
i
would
rather
not
i
i
take
the
interest
in
these
things
that
i
ought
perhaps
they
are
very
dreadful
to
nonsense
said
frere
with
a
scowl
we
come
burgess
of
the
next
two
days
were
devoted
to
sylvia
was
taken
through
the
hospital
and
the
workshops
shown
the
semaphores
and
shut
up
by
maurice
in
a
dark
cell
her
husband
and
burgess
seemed
to
treat
the
prison
like
a
tame
animal
whom
they
could
handle
at
their
leisure
and
whose
natural
ferocity
was
kept
in
check
by
their
superior
intelligence
this
bringing
of
a
young
and
pretty
woman
into
immediate
contact
with
bolts
and
bars
had
about
it
an
incongruity
which
pleased
them
maurice
penetrated
everywhere
questioned
the
prisoners
jested
with
the
gaolers
even
in
the
munificence
of
his
heart
bestowed
tobacco
on
the
sick
with
such
graceful
rattlings
of
dry
bones
they
got
by
and
by
to
point
puer
where
a
luncheon
had
been
provided
an
unlucky
accident
had
occurred
at
point
puer
that
morning
however
and
the
place
was
in
a
suppressed
ferment
a
refractory
little
thief
named
peter
brown
aged
twelve
years
had
jumped
off
the
high
rock
and
drowned
himself
in
full
view
of
the
constables
these
jumpings
off
had
become
rather
frequent
lately
and
burgess
was
enraged
at
one
happening
on
this
particular
day
if
he
could
by
any
possibility
have
brought
the
corpse
of
poor
little
peter
brown
to
life
again
he
would
have
soundly
whipped
it
for
its
impertinence
it
is
most
unfortunate
he
said
to
frere
as
they
stood
in
the
cell
where
the
little
body
was
laid
that
it
should
have
happened
oh
says
frere
frowning
down
upon
the
young
face
that
seemed
to
smile
up
at
him
it
ca
be
helped
i
know
those
young
devils
they
do
it
out
of
spite
what
sort
of
a
character
had
he
very
bad
johnson
the
johnson
bringing
it
the
two
saw
peter
brown
iniquities
set
down
in
the
neatest
of
running
hand
and
the
record
of
his
punishments
ornamented
in
quite
an
artistic
way
with
flourishes
of
red
ink
november
disorderly

one

insolence

that
was
the
last
asked
frere
yes
sir
says
johnson
and
then
he
hum
did
it
just
so
sir
that
was
the
way
of
just
so
the
magnificent
system
starved
and
tortured
a
child
of
twelve
until
he
killed
himself
that
was
the
way
of
it
after
luncheon
the
party
made
a
progress
everything
was
most
admirable
there
was
a
long
schoolroom
where
such
men
as
meekin
taught
how
christ
loved
little
children
and
behind
the
schoolroom
were
the
cells
and
the
constables
and
the
little
yard
where
they
gave
their
twenty
lashes
sylvia
shuddered
at
the
array
of
faces
from
the
stolid
nineteen
years
old
booby
of
the
kentish
to
the
wizened
shrewd
ten
years
old
bohemian
of
the
london
streets
all
degrees
and
grades
of
juvenile
vice
grinned
in
untamable
wickedness
or
snuffed
in
affected
piety
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
said
or
is
reported
to
have
said
the
founder
of
our
established
religion
of
such
it
seemed
that
a
large
number
of
honourable
gentlemen
together
with
her
majesty
faithful
commons
in
parliament
assembled
had
done
their
best
to
create
a
kingdom
of
hell
after
the
farce
had
been
played
again
and
the
children
had
stood
up
and
sat
down
and
sung
a
hymn
and
told
how
many
twice
five
were
and
repeated
their
belief
in
one
god
the
father
almighty
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
the
party
reviewed
the
workshops
and
saw
the
church
and
went
everywhere
but
into
the
room
where
the
body
of
peter
brown
aged
twelve
lay
starkly
on
its
wooden
bench
staring
at
the
gaol
roof
which
was
between
it
and
heaven
just
outside
this
room
sylvia
met
with
a
little
adventure
meekin
had
stopped
behind
and
burgess
being
suddenly
summoned
for
some
official
duty
frere
had
gone
with
him
leaving
his
wife
to
rest
on
a
bench
that
placed
at
the
summit
of
the
cliff
overlooked
the
sea
while
resting
thus
she
became
aware
of
another
presence
and
turning
her
head
beheld
a
small
boy
with
his
cap
in
one
hand
and
a
hammer
in
the
other
the
appearance
of
the
little
creature
clad
in
a
uniform
of
grey
cloth
that
was
too
large
for
him
and
holding
in
his
withered
little
hand
a
hammer
that
was
too
heavy
for
him
had
something
pathetic
about
it
what
is
it
you
mite
asked
sylvia
we
thought
you
might
have
seen
him
mum
said
the
little
figure
opening
its
blue
eyes
with
wonder
at
the
kindness
of
the
tone
him
whom
cranky
brown
mum
returned
the
child
him
as
did
it
this
morning
me
and
billy
knowed
him
mum
he
was
a
mate
of
ours
and
we
wanted
to
know
if
he
looked
what
do
you
mean
child
said
she
with
a
strange
terror
at
her
heart
and
then
filled
with
pity
at
the
aspect
of
the
little
being
she
drew
him
to
her
with
sudden
womanly
instinct
and
kissed
him
he
looked
up
at
her
with
joyful
surprise
oh
he
said
sylvia
kissed
him
again
does
nobody
ever
kiss
you
poor
little
man
said
she
mother
used
to
was
the
reply
but
she
at
home
oh
mum
with
a
sudden
crimsoning
of
the
little
face
may
i
fetch
billy
and
taking
courage
from
the
bright
young
face
he
gravely
marched
to
an
angle
of
the
rock
and
brought
out
another
little
creature
with
another
grey
uniform
and
another
hammer
this
is
billy
mum
he
said
billy
never
had
no
mother
kiss
the
young
wife
felt
the
tears
rush
to
her
eyes
you
two
poor
babies
she
cried
and
then
forgetting
that
she
was
a
lady
dressed
in
silk
and
lace
she
fell
on
her
knees
in
the
dust
and
folding
the
friendless
pair
in
her
arms
wept
over
them
what
is
the
matter
sylvia
said
frere
when
he
came
up
you
been
nothing
maurice
at
least
i
will
tell
you
by
and
when
they
were
alone
that
evening
she
told
him
of
the
two
little
boys
and
he
laughed
artful
little
humbugs
he
said
and
supported
his
argument
by
so
many
illustrations
of
the
precocious
wickedness
of
juvenile
felons
that
his
wife
was
half
convinced
against
her
will
unfortunately
when
sylvia
went
away
tommy
and
billy
put
into
execution
a
plan
which
they
had
carried
in
their
poor
little
heads
for
some
weeks
i
can
do
it
now
said
tommy
i
feel
will
it
hurt
much
tommy
said
billy
who
was
not
so
courageous
not
so
much
as
a
i
afraid
oh
tom
it
so
deep
do
leave
me
tom
the
bigger
boy
took
his
little
handkerchief
from
his
neck
and
with
it
bound
his
own
left
hand
to
his
companion
right
now
i
ca
leave
what
was
it
the
lady
that
kissed
us
said
tommy
lord
have
pity
on
them
two
fatherless
children
repeated
tommy
let
say
it
and
so
the
two
babies
knelt
on
the
brink
of
the
cliff
and
raising
the
bound
hands
together
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
ungrammatically
said
lord
have
pity
on
we
two
fatherless
children
and
then
they
kissed
each
other
and
did
it
the
intelligence
transmitted
by
the
semaphore
reached
the
commandant
in
the
midst
of
dinner
and
in
his
agitation
he
blurted
it
out
these
are
the
two
poor
things
i
saw
in
the
morning
cried
sylvia
oh
maurice
these
two
poor
babies
driven
to
suicide
condemning
their
young
souls
to
everlasting
fire
said
meekin
piously
mr
meekin
how
can
you
talk
like
that
poor
little
creatures
oh
it
horrible
maurice
take
me
and
she
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
i
ca
help
it
says
burgess
rudely
ashamed
it
ai
my
she
nervous
says
frere
leading
her
away
you
must
excuse
her
come
and
lie
down
i
will
not
stay
here
longer
said
she
let
us
go
we
ca
said
frere
oh
yes
we
can
i
insist
maurice
if
you
love
me
take
me
well
said
maurice
moved
by
her
evident
grief
i
he
spoke
to
burgess
burgess
this
matter
has
unsettled
my
wife
so
that
she
wants
to
leave
at
once
i
must
visit
the
neck
you
know
how
can
we
do
it
well
says
burgess
if
the
wind
only
holds
the
brig
could
go
round
to
pirates
bay
and
pick
you
up
you
only
be
a
night
at
the
i
think
that
would
be
best
said
frere
we
start
please
and
if
you
give
me
a
pen
and
ink
i
be
i
hope
you
are
satisfied
said
burgess
oh
yes
quite
said
frere
i
must
recommend
more
careful
supervision
at
point
puer
though
it
will
never
do
to
have
these
young
blackguards
slipping
through
our
fingers
in
this
so
a
neatly
written
statement
of
the
occurrence
was
appended
to
the
ledgers
in
which
the
names
of
william
tomkins
and
thomas
grove
were
entered
macklewain
held
an
inquest
and
nobody
troubled
about
them
any
more
why
should
they
the
prisons
of
london
were
full
of
such
tommys
and
billys
sylvia
passed
through
the
rest
of
her
journey
in
a
dream
of
terror
the
incident
of
the
children
had
shaken
her
nerves
and
she
longed
to
be
away
from
the
place
and
its
associations
even
eaglehawk
neck
with
its
curious
dog
stages
and
its
natural
pavement
did
not
interest
her
mcnab
blandishments
were
wearisome
she
shuddered
as
she
gazed
into
the
boiling
abyss
of
the
and
shook
with
fear
as
the
commandant
train
rattled
over
the
dangerous
tramway
that
wound
across
the
precipice
to
long
bay
the
train
was
composed
of
a
number
of
low
wagons
pushed
and
dragged
up
the
steep
inclines
by
convicts
who
drew
themselves
up
in
the
wagons
when
the
trucks
dashed
down
the
slope
and
acted
as
drags
sylvia
felt
degraded
at
being
thus
drawn
by
human
beings
and
trembled
when
the
lash
cracked
and
the
convicts
answered
to
the
sting
like
cattle
moreover
there
was
among
the
foremost
of
these
beasts
of
burden
a
face
that
had
dimly
haunted
her
girlhood
and
only
lately
vanished
from
her
dreams
this
face
looked
on
her
she
thought
with
bitterest
loathing
and
scorn
and
she
felt
relieved
when
at
the
midday
halt
its
owner
was
ordered
to
fall
out
from
the
rest
and
was
with
four
others
for
the
homeward
journey
frere
struck
with
the
appearance
of
the
five
said
by
jove
poppet
there
are
our
old
friends
rex
and
dawes
and
the
others
they
wo
let
come
all
the
way
because
they
are
such
a
desperate
lot
they
might
make
a
rush
for
sylvia
comprehended
now
the
face
was
the
face
of
dawes
and
as
she
looked
after
him
she
saw
him
suddenly
raise
his
hands
above
his
head
with
a
motion
that
terrified
her
she
felt
for
an
instant
a
great
shock
of
pitiful
recollection
staring
at
the
group
she
strove
to
recall
when
and
how
rufus
dawes
the
wretch
from
whose
clutches
her
husband
had
saved
her
had
ever
merited
her
pity
but
her
clouded
memory
could
not
complete
the
picture
and
as
the
wagons
swept
round
a
curve
and
the
group
disappeared
she
awoke
from
her
reverie
with
a
sigh
maurice
she
whispered
how
is
it
that
the
sight
of
that
man
always
makes
me
sad
her
husband
frowned
and
then
caressing
her
bade
her
forget
the
man
and
the
place
and
her
fears
i
was
wrong
to
have
insisted
on
your
coming
he
said
they
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
vessel
the
next
morning
and
watched
the
natural
penitentiary
grow
dim
in
the
distance
you
were
not
strong
dawes
said
john
rex
you
love
that
girl
now
that
you
seen
her
another
man
wife
and
have
been
harnessed
like
a
beast
to
drag
him
along
the
road
while
he
held
her
in
his
arms
now
that
you
seen
and
suffered
that
perhaps
you
join
rufus
dawes
made
a
movement
of
agonized
impatience
you
better
you
never
get
out
of
this
place
any
other
way
come
be
a
man
join
us
no
it
is
your
only
chance
why
refuse
it
do
you
want
to
live
here
all
your
life
i
want
no
sympathy
from
you
or
any
other
i
will
not
join
rex
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
walked
away
if
you
think
to
get
any
good
out
of
that
you
are
mightily
mistaken
said
he
as
he
went
frere
has
put
a
stopper
upon
that
you
he
spoke
truly
nothing
more
was
heard
of
it
only
that
some
six
months
afterwards
north
when
at
parramatta
received
an
official
letter
in
which
the
expenditure
of
wax
and
printing
and
paper
was
as
large
as
it
could
be
made
which
informed
him
that
the
of
the
convict
department
had
decided
that
further
inquiry
concerning
the
death
of
the
prisoner
named
in
the
margin
was
unnecessary
and
that
some
gentleman
with
an
utterly
illegible
signature
had
the
honour
to
be
his
most
obedient
servant
chapter
xxii
gathering
in
the
threads
maurice
found
his
favourable
expectations
of
sydney
fully
realized
his
notable
escape
from
death
at
macquarie
harbour
his
alliance
with
the
daughter
of
so
respected
a
colonist
as
major
vickers
and
his
reputation
as
a
convict
disciplinarian
rendered
him
a
man
of
note
he
received
a
vacant
magistracy
and
became
even
more
noted
for
hardness
of
heart
and
artfulness
of
prison
knowledge
than
before
the
convict
population
spoke
of
him
as
that
frere
and
registered
vows
of
vengeance
against
him
which
he
laughed
in
his
bluffness
to
scorn
one
anecdote
concerning
the
method
by
which
he
shepherded
his
flock
will
suffice
to
show
his
character
and
his
value
it
was
his
custom
to
visit
the
at
hyde
park
barracks
twice
a
week
visitors
to
convicts
were
of
course
armed
and
the
two
that
peeped
from
frere
waistcoat
attracted
many
a
longing
eye
how
easy
would
it
be
for
some
fellow
to
pluck
one
forth
and
shatter
the
smiling
hateful
face
of
the
noted
disciplinarian
frere
however
brave
to
rashness
never
would
bestow
his
weapons
more
safely
but
lounged
through
the
yard
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
and
the
deadly
butts
ready
to
the
hand
of
anyone
bold
enough
to
take
them
one
day
a
man
named
kavanagh
a
captured
absconder
who
had
openly
sworn
in
the
dock
the
death
of
the
magistrate
walked
quickly
up
to
him
as
he
was
passing
through
the
yard
and
snatched
a
pistol
from
his
belt
the
yard
caught
its
breath
and
the
attendant
warder
hearing
the
click
of
the
lock
instinctively
turned
his
head
away
so
that
he
might
not
be
blinded
by
the
flash
but
kavanagh
did
not
fire
at
the
instant
when
his
hand
was
on
the
pistol
he
looked
up
and
met
the
magnetic
glance
of
frere
imperious
eyes
an
effort
and
the
spell
would
have
been
broken
a
twitch
of
the
finger
and
his
enemy
would
have
fallen
dead
there
was
an
instant
when
that
twitch
of
the
finger
could
have
been
given
but
kavanagh
let
that
instant
pass
the
dauntless
eye
fascinated
him
he
played
with
the
pistol
nervously
while
all
remained
stupefied
frere
stood
without
withdrawing
his
hands
from
the
pockets
into
which
they
were
plunged
that
a
fine
pistol
jack
he
said
at
last
kavanagh
down
whose
white
face
the
sweat
was
pouring
burst
into
a
hideous
laugh
of
relieved
terror
and
thrust
the
weapon
cocked
as
it
was
back
again
into
the
magistrate
belt
frere
slowly
drew
one
hand
from
his
pocket
took
the
cocked
pistol
and
levelled
it
at
his
recent
assailant
that
the
best
chance
you
ever
get
jack
said
he
kavanagh
fell
on
his
knees
for
god
sake
captain
frere
frere
looked
down
on
the
trembling
wretch
and
then
uncocked
the
pistol
with
a
laugh
of
ferocious
contempt
get
up
you
dog
he
said
it
takes
a
better
man
than
you
to
best
me
bring
him
up
in
the
morning
hawkins
and
we
give
him
as
he
went
out
so
great
is
the
admiration
for
power
the
poor
devils
in
the
yard
cheered
him
one
of
the
first
things
that
this
useful
officer
did
upon
his
arrival
in
sydney
was
to
inquire
for
sarah
purfoy
to
his
astonishment
he
discovered
that
she
was
the
proprietor
of
large
export
warehouses
in
owned
a
neat
cottage
on
one
of
the
points
of
land
which
jutted
into
the
bay
and
was
reputed
to
possess
a
banking
account
of
no
inconsiderable
magnitude
he
in
vain
applied
his
brains
to
solve
this
mystery
his
mistress
had
not
been
rich
when
she
left
van
diemen
land
at
least
so
she
had
assured
him
and
appearances
bore
out
her
assurance
how
had
she
accumulated
this
sudden
wealth
above
all
why
had
she
thus
invested
it
he
made
inquiries
at
the
banks
but
was
snubbed
for
his
pains
sydney
banks
in
those
days
did
some
queer
business
purfoy
had
come
to
them
fully
accredited
said
the
manager
with
a
smile
but
where
did
she
get
the
money
asked
the
magistrate
i
am
suspicious
of
these
sudden
fortunes
the
woman
was
a
notorious
character
in
hobart
town
and
when
she
left
had
a
my
dear
captain
frere
said
the
acute
banker
his
father
had
been
one
of
the
builders
of
the
rum
hospital
it
is
not
the
custom
of
our
bank
to
make
inquiries
into
the
previous
history
of
its
customers
the
bills
were
good
you
may
depend
or
we
should
not
have
honoured
them
good
morning
the
bills
frere
saw
but
one
explanation
sarah
had
received
the
proceeds
of
some
of
rex
rogueries
rex
letter
to
his
father
and
the
mention
of
the
sum
of
money
in
the
old
house
in
blue
anchor
yard
flashed
across
his
memory
perhaps
sarah
had
got
the
money
from
the
receiver
and
appropriated
it
but
why
invest
it
in
an
oil
and
tallow
warehouse
he
had
always
been
suspicious
of
the
woman
because
he
had
never
understood
her
and
his
suspicions
redoubled
convinced
that
there
was
some
plot
hatching
he
determined
to
use
all
the
advantages
that
his
position
gave
him
to
discover
the
secret
and
bring
it
to
light
the
name
of
the
man
to
whom
rex
letters
had
been
addressed
was
blicks
he
would
find
out
if
any
of
the
convicts
under
his
care
had
heard
of
blicks
prosecuting
his
inquiries
in
the
proper
direction
he
soon
obtained
a
reply
blicks
was
a
london
receiver
of
stolen
goods
known
to
at
least
a
dozen
of
the
black
sheep
of
the
sydney
fold
he
was
reputed
to
be
enormously
wealthy
had
often
been
tried
but
never
convicted
frere
was
thus
not
much
nearer
enlightenment
than
before
and
an
incident
occurred
a
few
months
afterwards
which
increased
his
bewilderment
he
had
not
been
long
established
in
his
magistracy
when
blunt
came
to
claim
payment
for
the
voyage
of
sarah
purfoy
that
schooner
going
begging
one
may
say
sir
said
blunt
when
the
office
door
was
shut
what
schooner
the
now
the
franklin
was
a
vessel
of
three
hundred
and
twenty
tons
which
plied
between
norfolk
island
and
sydney
as
the
osprey
had
plied
in
the
old
days
between
macquarie
harbour
and
hobart
town
i
am
afraid
that
is
rather
stiff
blunt
said
frere
that
one
of
the
best
billets
going
you
know
i
doubt
if
i
have
enough
interest
to
get
it
for
you
besides
he
added
eyeing
the
sailor
critically
you
are
getting
oldish
for
that
sort
of
thing
ai
you
phineas
blunt
stretched
his
arms
wide
and
opened
his
mouth
full
of
sound
white
teeth
i
am
good
for
twenty
years
more
yet
sir
he
said
my
father
was
trading
to
the
indies
at
years
of
age
hearty
enough
thank
god
for
barring
a
drop
of
rum
now
and
then
no
vices
to
speak
of
however
i
ai
in
a
hurry
captain
for
a
month
or
so
only
i
thought
i
jog
your
memory
a
bit
d
ye
oh
you
not
in
a
hurry
where
are
you
going
then
well
said
blunt
shifting
on
his
seat
uneasy
under
eye
i
got
a
job
on
glad
of
it
i
sure
what
sort
of
a
job
a
job
of
whaling
said
blunt
more
uneasy
than
before
oh
that
it
is
it
your
old
line
of
business
and
who
employs
you
now
there
was
no
suspicion
in
the
tone
and
had
blunt
chosen
to
evade
the
question
he
might
have
done
so
without
difficulty
but
he
replied
as
one
who
had
anticipated
such
questioning
and
had
been
advised
how
to
answer
it
mrs
what
cried
frere
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
ears
she
got
a
couple
of
ships
now
captain
and
she
made
me
skipper
of
one
of
we
look
for
beshdellamare
and
take
a
turn
at
harpooning
frere
stared
at
blunt
who
stared
at
the
window
there
was
so
the
instinct
of
the
magistrate
told
him
some
strange
project
afoot
yet
that
common
sense
which
so
often
misleads
us
urged
that
it
was
quite
natural
sarah
should
employ
whaling
vessels
to
increase
her
trade
granted
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
her
obtaining
the
business
there
was
nothing
strange
about
her
owning
a
couple
of
whaling
vessels
there
were
people
in
sydney
of
no
better
origin
who
owned
oh
said
he
and
when
do
you
start
i
expecting
to
get
the
word
every
day
returned
blunt
apparently
relieved
and
i
thought
i
just
come
and
see
you
first
in
case
of
anything
falling
frere
played
with
a
on
the
table
in
silence
for
a
while
allowing
it
to
fall
through
his
fingers
with
a
series
of
sharp
clicks
and
then
he
said
where
does
she
get
the
money
from
blest
if
i
know
said
blunt
in
unaffected
simplicity
that
beyond
me
she
says
she
saved
it
but
that
all
my
eye
you
you
do
know
anything
about
it
then
cried
frere
suddenly
fierce
no
not
because
if
there
any
game
on
she
better
take
care
he
cried
relapsing
in
his
excitement
into
the
convict
vernacular
she
knows
me
tell
her
that
i
got
my
eyes
on
her
let
her
remember
her
bargain
if
she
runs
any
rigs
on
me
let
her
take
in
his
suspicious
wrath
he
so
savagely
and
unwarily
struck
downwards
with
the
open
that
it
shut
upon
his
fingers
and
cut
him
to
the
bone
i
tell
her
said
blunt
wiping
his
brow
i
sure
she
go
to
sell
you
but
i
look
in
when
i
come
back
when
he
got
outside
he
drew
a
long
breath
by
the
lord
harry
but
it
a
ticklish
game
to
play
he
said
to
himself
with
a
lively
recollection
of
the
dreaded
frere
vehemence
and
there
only
one
woman
in
the
world
be
fool
enough
to
play
it
maurice
frere
oppressed
with
suspicions
ordered
his
horse
that
afternoon
and
rode
down
to
see
the
cottage
which
the
owner
of
purfoy
stores
had
purchased
he
found
it
a
low
white
building
situated
four
miles
from
the
city
at
the
extreme
end
of
a
tongue
of
land
which
ran
into
the
deep
waters
of
the
harbour
a
garden
carefully
cultivated
stood
between
the
roadway
and
the
house
and
in
this
garden
he
saw
a
man
digging
does
purfoy
live
here
he
asked
pushing
open
one
of
the
iron
gates
the
man
replied
in
the
affirmative
staring
at
the
visitor
with
some
suspicion
is
she
at
home
you
are
sure
if
you
do
believe
me
ask
at
the
house
was
the
reply
given
in
the
uncourteous
tone
of
a
free
man
frere
pushed
his
horse
through
the
gate
and
walked
up
the
broad
and
carriage
drive
a
in
livery
answering
his
ring
told
him
that
purfoy
had
gone
to
town
and
then
shut
the
door
in
his
face
frere
more
astonished
than
ever
at
these
outward
and
visible
signs
of
independence
paused
indignant
feeling
half
inclined
to
enter
despite
opposition
as
he
looked
through
the
break
of
the
trees
he
saw
the
masts
of
a
brig
lying
at
anchor
off
the
extremity
of
the
point
on
which
the
house
was
built
and
understood
that
the
cottage
commanded
communication
by
water
as
well
as
by
land
could
there
be
a
special
motive
in
choosing
such
a
situation
or
was
it
mere
chance
he
was
uneasy
but
strove
to
dismiss
his
alarm
sarah
had
kept
faith
with
him
so
far
she
had
entered
upon
a
new
and
more
reputable
life
and
why
should
he
seek
to
imagine
evil
where
perhaps
no
evil
was
blunt
was
evidently
honest
women
like
sarah
purfoy
often
emerged
into
a
condition
of
comparative
riches
and
domestic
virtue
it
was
likely
that
after
all
some
wealthy
merchant
was
the
real
owner
of
the
house
and
garden
pleasure
yacht
and
tallow
warehouse
and
that
he
had
no
cause
for
fear
the
experienced
convict
disciplinarian
did
not
rate
the
ability
of
john
rex
high
enough
from
the
instant
the
convict
had
heard
his
sentence
of
life
banishment
he
had
determined
upon
escaping
and
had
brought
all
the
powers
of
his
acute
and
unscrupulous
intellect
to
the
consideration
of
the
best
method
of
achieving
his
purpose
his
first
care
was
to
procure
money
this
he
thought
to
do
by
writing
to
blick
but
when
informed
by
meekin
of
the
fate
of
his
letter
he
adopted
the
to
him
less
pleasant
alternative
of
procuring
it
through
sarah
purfoy
it
was
peculiar
to
the
man
hard
and
ungrateful
nature
that
despite
the
attachment
of
the
woman
who
had
followed
him
to
his
place
of
durance
and
had
made
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
set
him
free
he
had
cherished
for
her
no
affection
it
was
her
beauty
that
had
attracted
him
when
as
lionel
crofton
he
swaggered
in
the
of
london
her
talents
and
her
devotion
were
secondary
considerations
useful
to
him
as
attributes
of
a
creature
he
owned
but
not
to
be
thought
of
when
his
fancy
wearied
of
its
choice
during
the
twelve
years
which
had
passed
since
his
rashness
had
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
the
law
at
the
house
of
green
the
coiner
he
had
been
oppressed
with
no
regrets
for
her
fate
he
had
indeed
seen
and
suffered
so
much
that
the
old
life
had
been
put
away
from
him
when
on
his
return
he
heard
that
sarah
purfoy
was
still
in
hobart
town
he
was
glad
for
he
knew
that
he
had
an
ally
who
would
do
her
utmost
to
help
him
she
had
shown
that
on
board
the
malabar
but
he
was
also
sorry
for
he
remembered
that
the
price
she
would
demand
for
her
services
was
his
affection
and
that
had
cooled
long
ago
however
he
would
make
use
of
her
there
might
be
a
way
to
discard
her
if
she
proved
troublesome
his
pretended
piety
had
accomplished
the
end
he
had
assumed
it
for
despite
frere
exposure
of
his
cryptograph
he
had
won
the
confidence
of
meekin
and
into
that
worthy
creature
ear
he
poured
a
strange
and
sad
story
he
was
the
son
he
said
of
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
whose
real
name
such
was
his
reverence
for
the
cloth
should
never
pass
his
lips
he
was
transported
for
a
forgery
which
he
did
not
commit
sarah
purfoy
was
his
wife
his
erring
lost
and
yet
loved
wife
she
an
innocent
and
trusting
girl
had
determined
strong
in
the
remembrance
of
that
promise
she
had
made
at
the
altar
to
follow
her
husband
to
his
place
of
doom
and
had
hired
herself
as
to
vickers
alas
fever
prostrated
that
husband
on
a
bed
of
sickness
and
maurice
frere
the
profligate
and
the
villain
had
taken
advantage
of
the
wife
unprotected
state
to
ruin
her
rex
darkly
hinted
how
the
seducer
made
his
power
over
the
sick
and
helpless
husband
a
weapon
against
the
virtue
of
the
wife
and
so
terrified
poor
meekin
that
had
it
not
happened
so
long
ago
he
would
have
thought
it
necessary
to
look
with
some
disfavour
upon
the
boisterous
of
major
vickers
i
bear
him
no
sir
said
rex
i
did
at
first
there
was
a
time
when
i
could
have
killed
him
but
when
i
had
him
in
my
power
i
as
you
know
forbore
to
strike
no
sir
i
could
not
commit
murder
very
proper
says
meekin
very
proper
god
will
punish
him
in
his
own
way
and
his
own
time
continued
rex
my
great
sorrow
is
for
the
poor
woman
she
is
in
sydney
i
have
heard
living
respectably
sir
and
my
heart
bleeds
for
here
rex
heaved
a
sigh
that
would
have
made
his
fortune
on
the
boards
my
poor
fellow
said
meekin
do
you
know
where
she
is
i
do
you
might
write
to
john
rex
appeared
to
hesitate
to
struggle
with
himself
and
finally
to
take
a
deep
resolve
no
meekin
i
will
not
why
not
you
know
the
orders
sir
the
commandant
reads
all
the
letters
sent
could
i
write
to
my
poor
sarah
what
other
eyes
were
to
read
and
he
watched
the
parson
slyly
n
no
you
could
not
said
meekin
at
last
it
is
true
sir
said
rex
letting
his
head
sink
on
his
breast
the
next
day
meekin
blushing
with
the
consciousness
that
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
wrong
said
to
his
penitent
if
you
will
promise
to
write
nothing
that
the
commandant
might
not
see
rex
i
will
send
your
letter
to
your
heaven
bless
you
sir
said
rex
and
took
two
days
to
compose
an
epistle
which
should
tell
sarah
purfoy
how
to
act
the
letter
was
a
model
of
composition
in
one
way
it
stated
everything
clearly
and
succinctly
not
a
detail
that
could
assist
was
omitted
not
a
line
that
could
embarrass
was
suffered
to
remain
john
rex
scheme
of
six
deliberation
was
set
down
in
the
clearest
possible
manner
he
brought
his
letter
unsealed
to
meekin
meekin
looked
at
it
with
an
interest
that
was
half
suspicion
have
i
your
word
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
that
might
not
be
read
by
the
commandant
john
rex
was
a
bold
man
but
at
the
sight
of
the
deadly
thing
fluttering
open
in
the
clergyman
hand
his
knees
knocked
together
strong
in
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
however
he
pursued
his
desperate
plan
read
it
sir
he
said
turning
away
his
face
reproachfully
you
are
a
gentleman
i
can
trust
no
rex
said
meekin
walking
loftily
into
the
pitfall
i
do
not
read
private
it
was
sealed
and
john
rex
felt
as
if
somebody
had
withdrawn
a
match
from
a
powder
barrel
in
a
month
meekin
received
a
letter
beautifully
written
from
sarah
rex
stating
briefly
that
she
had
heard
of
his
goodness
that
the
enclosed
letter
was
for
her
husband
and
that
if
it
was
against
the
rules
to
give
it
him
she
begged
it
might
be
returned
to
her
unread
of
course
meekin
gave
it
to
rex
who
next
morning
handed
to
meekin
a
most
touching
pious
production
begging
him
to
read
it
meekin
did
so
and
any
suspicions
he
may
have
had
were
at
once
disarmed
he
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
the
pious
letter
contained
a
private
one
intended
for
john
rex
only
which
letter
john
rex
thought
so
highly
of
that
having
read
it
twice
through
most
attentively
he
ate
it
the
plan
of
escape
was
after
all
a
simple
one
sarah
purfoy
was
to
obtain
from
blicks
the
moneys
he
held
in
trust
and
to
embark
the
sum
thus
obtained
in
any
business
which
would
suffer
her
to
keep
a
vessel
hovering
round
the
southern
coast
of
van
diemen
land
without
exciting
suspicion
the
escape
was
to
be
made
in
the
winter
months
if
possible
in
june
or
july
the
watchful
vessel
was
to
be
commanded
by
some
trustworthy
person
who
was
to
frequently
land
on
the
side
and
keep
a
for
any
extraordinary
appearance
along
the
coast
rex
himself
must
be
left
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
dogs
and
guards
unaided
this
seems
a
desperate
scheme
wrote
rex
but
it
is
not
so
wild
as
it
looks
i
have
thought
over
a
dozen
others
and
rejected
them
all
this
is
the
only
way
consider
it
well
i
have
my
own
plan
for
escape
which
is
easy
if
rescue
be
at
hand
all
depends
upon
placing
a
trustworthy
man
in
charge
of
the
vessel
you
ought
to
know
a
dozen
such
i
will
wait
eighteen
months
to
give
you
time
to
make
all
the
eighteen
months
had
now
nearly
passed
over
and
the
time
for
the
desperate
attempt
drew
near
faithful
to
his
cruel
philosophy
john
rex
had
provided
who
by
their
vicarious
agonies
should
assist
him
to
his
salvation
he
had
discovered
that
of
the
twenty
men
in
his
gang
eight
had
already
determined
on
an
effort
for
freedom
the
names
of
these
eight
were
gabbett
vetch
bodenham
cornelius
greenhill
sanders
called
the
moocher
cox
and
travers
the
leading
spirits
were
vetch
and
gabbett
who
with
profound
reverence
requested
the
dandy
to
join
john
rex
ever
suspicious
and
feeling
repelled
by
the
giant
strange
eagerness
at
first
refused
but
by
degrees
allowed
himself
to
appear
to
be
drawn
into
the
scheme
he
would
urge
these
men
to
their
fate
and
take
advantage
of
the
excitement
attendant
on
their
absence
to
effect
his
own
escape
while
all
the
island
is
looking
for
these
eight
boobies
i
shall
have
a
good
chance
to
slip
away
he
wished
however
to
have
a
companion
some
strong
man
who
if
pressed
hard
would
turn
and
keep
the
pursuers
at
bay
would
be
useful
without
doubt
and
this
he
sought
in
rufus
dawes
beginning
as
we
have
seen
from
a
purely
selfish
motive
to
urge
his
to
abscond
with
him
john
rex
gradually
found
himself
attracted
into
something
like
friendliness
by
the
sternness
with
which
his
overtures
were
repelled
always
a
keen
student
of
human
nature
the
scoundrel
saw
beneath
the
roughness
with
which
it
had
pleased
the
unfortunate
man
to
shroud
his
agony
how
faithful
a
friend
and
how
ardent
and
undaunted
a
spirit
was
concealed
there
was
moreover
a
mystery
about
rufus
dawes
which
rex
the
reader
of
hearts
longed
to
fathom
have
you
no
friends
whom
you
would
wish
to
see
he
asked
one
evening
when
rufus
dawes
had
proved
more
than
usually
deaf
to
his
arguments
no
said
dawes
gloomily
my
friends
are
all
dead
to
what
all
asked
the
other
most
men
have
some
one
whom
they
wish
to
rufus
dawes
laughed
a
slow
heavy
laugh
i
am
better
then
are
you
content
to
live
this
dog
life
enough
enough
said
dawes
i
am
pooh
pluck
up
a
spirit
cried
rex
it
ca
fail
i
been
thinking
of
it
for
eighteen
months
and
it
ca
who
are
going
asked
the
other
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
john
rex
enumerated
the
eight
and
dawes
raised
his
head
i
wo
go
i
have
had
two
trials
at
it
i
do
want
another
i
would
advise
you
not
to
attempt
it
why
not
gabbett
bolted
twice
before
said
rufus
dawes
shuddering
at
the
remembrance
of
the
ghastly
object
he
had
seen
in
the
sunlit
glen
at
hell
gates
others
went
with
him
but
each
time
he
returned
what
do
you
mean
asked
rex
struck
by
the
tone
of
his
companion
what
became
of
the
others
died
i
suppose
said
the
dandy
with
a
forced
laugh
yes
but
how
they
were
all
without
food
how
came
the
surviving
monster
to
live
six
weeks
john
rex
grew
a
shade
paler
and
did
not
reply
he
recollected
the
sanguinary
legend
that
pertained
to
gabbett
rescue
but
he
did
not
intend
to
make
the
journey
in
his
company
so
after
all
he
had
no
cause
for
fear
come
with
me
then
he
said
at
length
we
will
try
our
luck
no
i
have
resolved
i
stay
and
leave
your
innocence
how
can
i
prove
it
cried
rufus
dawes
roughly
impatient
there
are
crimes
committed
which
are
never
brought
to
light
and
this
is
one
of
well
said
rex
rising
as
if
weary
of
the
discussion
have
it
your
own
way
then
you
know
best
the
private
detective
game
is
hard
work
i
myself
have
gone
on
a
chase
before
now
there
a
mystery
about
a
certain
son
which
took
me
four
months
to
unravel
and
then
i
lost
the
a
son
who
was
he
john
rex
paused
in
wonderment
at
the
eager
interest
with
which
the
question
was
put
and
then
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
this
new
opening
for
conversation
a
queer
story
a
character
in
my
time
sir
richard
devine
a
miserly
old
curmudgeon
with
a
scapegrace
rufus
dawes
bit
his
lips
to
avoid
showing
his
emotion
this
was
the
second
time
that
the
name
of
his
dead
father
had
been
spoken
in
his
hearing
i
think
i
remember
something
of
him
he
said
with
a
voice
that
sounded
strangely
calm
in
his
own
ears
a
curious
story
said
rex
plunging
into
past
memories
amongst
other
matters
i
dabbled
a
little
in
the
private
inquiry
line
of
business
and
the
old
man
came
to
me
he
had
a
son
who
had
gone
abroad
a
wild
young
dog
by
all
accounts
and
he
wanted
particulars
of
did
you
get
them
to
a
certain
extent
i
hunted
him
through
paris
into
brussels
from
brussels
to
antwerp
from
antwerp
back
to
paris
i
lost
him
there
a
miserable
end
to
a
long
and
expensive
search
i
got
nothing
but
a
portmanteau
with
a
lot
of
letters
from
his
mother
i
sent
the
particulars
to
the
and
by
all
accounts
the
news
killed
him
for
he
died
not
long
and
the
son
came
to
the
queerest
end
of
all
the
old
man
had
left
him
his
fortune
a
large
one
i
believe
but
he
left
europe
it
seems
for
india
and
was
lost
in
the
hydaspes
frere
was
his
ah
by
gad
it
annoys
me
when
i
think
of
it
continued
rex
feeling
by
force
of
memory
once
more
the
adventurer
of
fashion
with
the
resources
i
had
too
oh
a
miserable
failure
the
days
and
nights
spent
walking
about
looking
for
richard
devine
and
never
catching
a
glimpse
of
him
the
old
man
gave
me
his
son
portrait
with
full
particulars
of
his
early
life
and
i
suppose
i
carried
that
ivory
gimcrack
in
my
breast
for
nearly
three
months
pulling
it
out
to
refresh
my
memory
every
by
gad
if
the
young
gentleman
was
anything
like
his
picture
i
could
have
sworn
to
him
if
i
met
him
in
do
you
think
you
know
him
again
asked
rufus
dawes
in
a
low
voice
turning
away
his
head
there
may
have
been
something
in
the
attitude
in
which
the
speaker
had
put
himself
that
awakened
memory
or
perhaps
the
subdued
eagerness
of
the
tone
contrasting
so
strangely
with
the
comparative
inconsequence
of
the
theme
that
caused
john
rex
brain
to
perform
one
of
those
feats
of
automatic
synthesis
at
which
we
afterwards
wonder
the
profligate
son
the
likeness
to
the
portrait
the
mystery
of
dawes
life
these
were
the
links
of
a
galvanic
chain
he
closed
the
circuit
and
a
vivid
flash
revealed
to
him
the
man
warder
troke
coming
up
put
his
hand
on
rex
shoulder
dawes
he
said
you
wanted
at
the
yard
and
then
seeing
his
mistake
added
with
a
grin
curse
you
two
you
so
much
alike
one
ca
tell
from
rufus
dawes
walked
off
moodily
but
john
rex
evil
face
turned
pale
and
a
strange
hope
made
his
heart
leap
gad
troke
right
we
are
alike
i
not
press
him
to
escape
any
chapter
xxiii
running
the
gauntlet
the
pretty
mary
as
ugly
and
a
tub
as
ever
pitched
under
a
southerly
burster
had
been
lying
on
and
off
cape
surville
for
nearly
three
weeks
captain
blunt
was
getting
wearied
he
made
strenuous
efforts
to
find
the
of
which
he
was
ostensibly
in
search
but
no
success
attended
his
efforts
in
vain
did
he
take
boat
and
pull
into
every
cove
and
nook
between
the
hippolyte
reef
and
island
in
vain
did
he
run
the
pretty
mary
as
near
to
the
rugged
cliffs
as
he
dared
to
take
her
and
make
perpetual
expeditions
to
the
shore
in
vain
did
he
in
his
eagerness
for
the
interests
of
purfoy
clamber
up
the
rocks
and
spend
hours
in
solitary
soundings
in
blackman
bay
he
never
found
an
oyster
if
i
do
find
something
in
three
or
four
days
more
said
he
to
his
mate
i
shall
go
back
again
it
too
dangerous
cruising
on
the
same
evening
that
captain
blunt
made
this
resolution
the
watchman
at
signal
hill
saw
the
arms
of
the
semaphore
at
the
settlement
make
three
motions
thus
the
semaphore
was
furnished
with
three
revolving
arms
fixed
one
above
the
other
the
upper
one
denoted
units
and
had
six
motions
indicating
one
to
six
the
middle
one
denoted
tens
ten
to
sixty
the
lower
one
marked
hundreds
from
one
hundred
to
six
hundred
the
lower
and
upper
arms
whirled
out
that
meant
three
hundred
and
six
a
ball
ran
up
to
the
top
of
the
post
that
meant
one
thousand
number
or
being
interpreted
prisoners
absconded
by
george
harry
said
jones
the
signalman
there
a
bolt
the
semaphore
signalled
again
number
with
arms
jones
said
translating
as
he
read
come
here
harry
here
a
go
but
harry
did
not
reply
and
looking
down
the
watchman
saw
a
dark
figure
suddenly
fill
the
doorway
the
boasted
semaphore
had
failed
this
time
at
all
events
the
bolters
had
arrived
as
soon
as
the
signal
the
man
sprang
at
his
carbine
but
the
intruder
had
already
possessed
himself
of
it
it
no
use
making
a
fuss
jones
there
are
eight
of
us
oblige
me
by
attending
to
your
jones
knew
the
voice
it
was
that
of
john
rex
reply
ca
you
said
rex
coolly
captain
burgess
is
in
a
the
arms
of
the
semaphore
at
the
settlement
were
in
fact
gesticulating
with
comical
vehemence
jones
took
the
strings
in
his
hands
and
with
his
open
before
him
was
about
to
acknowledge
the
message
when
rex
stopped
him
send
this
message
he
said
not
seen
signal
sent
to
eaglehawk
jones
paused
irresolutely
he
was
himself
a
convict
and
dreaded
the
inevitable
cat
that
he
knew
would
follow
this
false
message
if
they
finds
me
out
he
said
rex
cocked
the
carbine
with
so
decided
a
meaning
in
his
black
eyes
that
jones
who
could
be
brave
enough
on
occasions
banished
his
hesitation
at
once
and
began
to
signal
eagerly
there
came
up
a
clinking
of
metal
and
a
murmur
from
below
keepin
yer
dandy
all
right
get
those
irons
off
and
then
we
talk
boys
i
putting
salt
on
old
burgess
the
rough
jest
was
received
with
a
roar
and
jones
looking
momentarily
down
from
his
window
on
the
staging
saw
in
the
waning
light
a
group
of
men
freeing
themselves
from
their
irons
with
a
hammer
taken
from
the
while
two
already
freed
were
casting
buckets
of
water
on
the
beacon
the
sentry
was
lying
bound
at
a
little
distance
now
said
the
leader
of
this
surprise
party
signal
to
woody
jones
perforce
obeyed
say
escape
at
the
mines
watch
point
send
on
to
eaglehawk
quick
now
jones
comprehending
at
once
the
force
of
this
manoeuvre
which
would
have
the
effect
of
distracting
attention
from
the
neck
executed

you

gabbett

oath
then
bring
that

any

you

lay
your

on

you
tied
him
on
we

and
in
the
space
of
five
minutes
from
the
time
when
unsuspecting
harry
had
been
silently
clutched
by
two
forms
who
rushed
upon
him
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
huts
the
signal
hill
station
was
deserted
at
the

burgess
was
foaming
nine
men
to
seize
the
long
bay
boat
and
get
half
an
hour
start
of
the
alarm
signal
was
an
unprecedented
achievement
what

troke
however
found
eight
hours
afterwards
disarmed
gagged
and
bound
in
the
scrub
had
been
guilty
of
no
negligence
how
could
he
tell
that
at
a
certain
signal
from
dandy
jack
the
nine
men
he
had
taken
to
stewart
bay
would
rush
him
and
before
he
could
draw
a
pistol
truss
him
like
a
chicken
the
worst
of
the
gang
rufus
dawes
had
volunteered
for
the
hated

troke
had
felt
himself
secure
how
could
he
possibly
guess
that
there
was
a
plot
in
which
rufus
dawes
of
all
men
had
refused
to
join
constables
mounted
and
on
foot
were
despatched
to
scour
the
bush
round
the
settlement
burgess
confident
from
the
reply
of
the
signal
hill
semaphore
that
the
alarm
had
been
given
at
eaglehawk
isthmus
promised
himself
the
of
the
gang
before
many
hours
and
giving
orders
to
keep
the
communications
going
retired
to
dinner
his
convict
servants
had
barely
removed
the
soup
when
the
result
of
john
ingenuity
became
manifest
the
semaphore
at
signal
hill
had
stopped
working
perhaps
the
fools
ca
see
said
burgess
fire
the
beacon
and
saddle
my
the
beacon
was
fired
all
right
at
mount
arthur
mount
communication
and
the
coal
mines
to
the
westward
the
line
was
clear
but
at
signal
hill
was
no
answering
light
burgess
stamped
with
rage
get
me
my
boat
crew
ready
and
tell
the
mines
to
signal
to
woody
as
he
stood
on
the
jetty
a
breathless
messenger
brought
the
reply
a
boat
crew
gone
to
point
five
men
sent
from
eaglehawk
in
obedience
to
orders
burgess
understood
it
at
once
the
fellows

decoyed

the

at
any
between
eaglehawk
and

hill
were
for
the
absconders
other
dangers
along
the
indented
coast
of
port
bunche
were
four
stations
these
stations
mere
huts
within
signalling
distance
of
each
other
fringed
the
shore
and
to
avoid
them
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
a
circuit
into
the
scrub
unwilling
as
he
was
to
lose
time
john
rex
saw
that
to
attempt
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
these
four
stations
would
be
destruction
the
safety
of
the
party
depended
upon
the
reaching
of
the
neck
while
the
guard
was
weakened
by
the
absence
of
some
of
the
men
along
the
southern
shore
and
before
the
alarm
could
be
given
from
the
eastern
arm
of
the
peninsula
with
this
view
he
ranged
his
men
in
single
file
and
quitting
the
road
near
norfolk
bay
made
straight
for
the
neck
the
night
had
set
in
with
a
high
westerly
wind
and
threatened
rain
it
was
pitch
dark
and
the
fugitives
were
guided
only
by
the
dull
roar
of
the
sea
as
it
beat
upon
descent
beach
had
it
not
been
for
the
accident
of
a
westerly
gale
they
would
not
have
had
even
so
much
assistance
the
crow
walked
first
as
guide
carrying
a
musket
taken
from
harry
then
came
gabbett
with
an
axe
followed
by
the
other
six
sharing
between
them
such
provisions
as
they
had
obtained
at
signal
hill
john
rex
with
the
carbine
and
troke
pistols
walked
last
it
had
been
agreed
that
if
attacked
they
were
to
run
each
one
his
own
way
in
their
desperate
case
disunion
was
strength
at
intervals
on
their
left
gleamed
the
lights
of
the
constables
stations
and
as
they
stumbled
onward
they
heard
plainer
and
more
plainly
the
hoarse
murmur
of
the
sea
beyond
which
was
liberty
or
death
after
nearly
two
hours
of
painful
progress
jemmy
vetch
stopped
and
whispered
them
to
approach
they
were
on
a
sandy
rise
to
the
left
was
a
black
object
a
constable
hut
to
the
right
was
a
dim
white
line
the
ocean
in
front
was
a
row
of
lamps
and
between
every
two
lamps
leapt
and
ran
a
dusky
indistinct
body
jemmy
vetch
pointed
with
his
lean
forefinger
the
dogs
instinctively
they
crouched
down
lest
even
at
that
distance
the
two
sentries
so
plainly
visible
in
the
red
light
of
the
fire
should
see
them
well
bo
said
gabbett
what
to
be
done
now
as
he
spoke
a
long
low
howl
broke
from
one
of
the
chained
hounds
and
the
whole
kennel
burst
into
hideous
outcry
john
rex
who
perhaps
was
the
bravest
of
the
party
shuddered
they
have
smelt
us
he
said
we
must
go
gabbett
spat
in
his
palm
and
took
firmer
hold
of
the
right
you
are
he
said
i
leave
my
mark
on
some
of
them
before
this
night
out
on
the
opposite
shore
lights
began
to
move
and
the
fugitives
could
hear
the
hurrying
tramp
of
feet
make
for
the
side
of
the
jetty
said
rex
in
a
fierce
whisper
i
think
i
see
a
boat
there
it
is
our
only
chance
now
we
can
never
break
through
the
station
are
we
ready
now
all
together
gabbett
was
fast
outstripping
the
others
by
some
three
feet
of
distance
there
were
eleven
dogs
two
of
whom
were
placed
on
stages
set
out
in
the
water
and
they
were
so
chained
that
their
muzzles
nearly
touched
the
giant
leapt
into
the
line
and
with
a
blow
of
his
axe
split
the
skull
of
the
beast
on
his
right
hand
this
action
unluckily
took
him
within
reach
of
the
other
dog
which
seized
him
by
the
thigh
fire
cried
mcnab
from
the
other
side
of
the
lamps
the
giant
uttered
a
cry
of
rage
and
pain
and
fell
with
the
dog
under
him
it
was
however
the
dog
who
had
pulled
him
down
and
the
intended
for
him
struck
travers
in
the
jaw
the
unhappy
villain
fell
like
virgil
dares
spitting
blood
teeth
and
gabbett
clutched
the
mastiff
throat
with
iron
hand
and
forced
him
to
loose
his
hold
then
bellowing
with
fury
seized
his
axe
and
sprang
forward
mangled
as
he
was
upon
the
nearest
soldier
jemmy
vetch
had
been
beforehand
with
him
uttering
a
low
snarl
of
hate
he
fired
and
shot
the
sentry
through
the
breast
the
others
rushed
through
the
now
broken
cordon
and
made
headlong
for
the
boat
fools
cried
rex
behind
them
you
have
wasted
a
shot
look
to
your
left
burgess
hurried
down
the
tramroad
by
his
men
had
tarried
at
signal
hill
only
long
enough
to
loose
the
surprised
guard
from
their
bonds
and
taking
the
woody
island
boat
was
pulling
with
a
fresh
crew
to
the
neck
the
reinforcement
was
not
ten
yards
from
the
jetty
the
crow
saw
the
danger
and
flinging
himself
into
the
water
desperately
seized
mcnab
boat
in
with
you
for
your
lives
he
cried
another
volley
from
the
guard
spattered
the
water
around
the
fugitives
but
in
the
darkness
the
bullets
fell
harmless
gabbett
swung
himself
over
the
sheets
and
seized
an
oar

and
as
burgess
leapt
to

cornelius
was

floated

mcnab
seeing
this
ran
down
to
the
to

the
commandant

over
the

he
shouted
with
a

so
and
raised
in
twelve
strong
arms
the
pursuing
craft
slid
across
the
isthmus
we
five
minutes

said
vetch
coolly
as
he
saw
the
commandant
take
his
place
in
the
stern
sheets
pull
away
my
jolly
boys
and
best
the
soldiers
on
the
neck
fired
again
almost
at
random
but
the
blaze
of
their
pieces
only
served
to
show
the
commandant
boat
a
hundred
yards
astern
of
that
of
the
mutineers
which
had
already
gained
the
deep
water
of
pirates
bay
then
for
the
first
time
the
six
prisoners
became
aware
that
john
rex
was
not
among
them
chapter
xxiv
in
the
night
john
rex
had
put
into
execution
the
first
part
of
his
scheme
at
the
moment
when
seeing
burgess
boat
near
the
he
had
uttered
the
warning
cry
heard
by
vetch
he
turned
back
into
the
darkness
and
made
for
the
water
edge
at
a
point
some
distance
from
the
neck
his
desperate
hope
was
that
the
attention
of
the
guard
being
concentrated
on
the
escaping
boat
he
might
favoured
by
the
darkness
and
the
confusion
swim
to
the
peninsula
it
was
not
a
very
marvellous
feat
to
accomplish
and
he
had
confidence
in
his
own
powers
once
safe
on
the
peninsula
his
plans
were
formed
but
owing
to
the
strong
westerly
wind
which
caused
an
incoming
tide
upon
the
isthmus
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
attain
some
point
sufficiently
far
to
the
southward
to
enable
him
on
taking
the
water
to
be
assisted
not
impeded
by
the
current
with
this
view
he
hurried
over
the
sandy
hummocks
at
the
entrance
to
the
neck
and
ran
backwards
towards
the
sea
in
a
few
strides
he
had
gained
the
hard
and
sandy
shore
and
pausing
to
listen
heard
behind
him
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
was
pursued
the
footsteps
stopped
and
then
a
voice
cried
surrender
it
was
mcnab
who
seeing
rex
retreat
had
daringly
followed
him
john
rex
drew
from
his
breast
troke
pistol
and
waited
surrender
cried
the
voice
again
and
the
footsteps
advanced
two
paces
at
the
instant
that
rex
raised
the
weapon
to
fire
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
showed
him
on
his
right
hand
on
the
ghastly
and
pallid
ocean
two
boats
the
hindermost
one
apparently
within
a
few
yards
of
him
the
men
looked
like
corpses
in
the
distance
rose
cape
surville
and
beneath
cape
surville
was
the
hungry
sea
the
scene
vanished
in
an
instant
swallowed
up
almost
before
he
had
realized
it
but
the
shock
it
gave
him
made
him
miss
his
aim
and
flinging
away
the
pistol
with
a
curse
he
turned
down
the
path
and
fled
mcnab
followed
the
path
had
been
made
by
frequent
passage
from
the
station
and
rex
found
it
tolerably
easy
running
he
had
acquired
like
most
men
who
live
much
in
the
dark
that
perception
of
obstacles
which
is
due
rather
to
increased
sensitiveness
of
touch
than
increased
acuteness
of
vision
his
feet
accommodated
themselves
to
the
inequalities
of
the
ground
his
hands
instinctively
outstretched
themselves
towards
the
overhanging
boughs
his
head
ducked
of
its
own
accord
to
any
obtrusive
sapling
which
bent
to
obstruct
his
progress
his
pursuer
was
not
so
fortunate
twice
did
john
rex
laugh
mentally
at
a
crash
and
scramble
that
told
of
a
fall
and
once
in
a
valley
where
trickled
a
little
stream
that
he
had
cleared
almost
without
an
effort
he
heard
a
splash
that
made
him
laugh
outright
the
track
now
began
to
go
uphill
and
rex
redoubled
his
efforts
trusting
to
his
superior
muscular
energy
to
shake
off
his
pursuer
he
breasted
the
rise
and
paused
to
listen
the
crashing
of
branches
behind
him
had
ceased
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
alone
he
had
gained
the
summit
of
the
cliff
the
lights
of
the
neck
were
invisible
below
him
lay
the
sea
out
of
the
black
emptiness
came
puffs
of
sharp
salt
wind
the
tops
of
the
rollers
that
broke
below
were
blown
off
and
whirled
away
into
the
night
white
patches
swallowed
up
immediately
in
the
increasing
darkness
from
the
north
side
of
the
bay
was
borne
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
breakers
as
they
dashed
against
the
perpendicular
cliffs
which
guarded
forrestier
peninsula
at
his
feet
arose
a
frightful
shrieking
and
whistling
broken
at
intervals
by
reports
like
claps
of
thunder
where
was
he
exhausted
and
breathless
he
sank
down
into
the
rough
scrub
and
listened
all
at
once
on
the
track
over
which
he
had
passed
he
heard
a
sound
that
made
him
bound
to
his
feet
in
deadly
fear
the
bay
of
a
dog
he
thrust
his
hand
to
his
breast
for
the
remaining
pistol
and
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
he
had
dropped
it
he
felt
round
about
him
in
the
darkness
for
some
stick
or
stone
that
might
serve
as
a
weapon
in
vain
his
fingers
clutched
nothing
but
prickly
scrub
and
coarse
grass
the
sweat
ran
down
his
face
with
staring
eyeballs
and
bristling
hair
he
stared
into
the
darkness
as
if
he
would
dissipate
it
by
the
very
intensity
of
his
gaze
the
noise
was
repeated
and
piercing
through
the
roar
of
wind
and
water
above
and
below
him
seemed
to
be
close
at
hand
he
heard
a
man
voice
cheering
the
dog
in
accents
that
the
gale
blew
away
from
him
before
he
could
recognize
them
it
was
probable
that
some
of
the
soldiers
had
been
sent
to
the
assistance
of
mcnab
capture
then
was
certain
in
his
agony
the
wretched
man
almost
promised
himself
repentance
should
he
escape
this
peril
the
dog
crashing
through
the
underwood
gave
one
short
sharp
howl
and
then
ran
mute
the
darkness
had
increased
the
gale
the
wind
ravaging
the
hollow
heaven
had
spread
between
the
lightnings
and
the
sea
an
impenetrable
curtain
of
black
cloud
it
seemed
possible
to
seize
upon
this
curtain
and
draw
its
edge
yet
closer
so
dense
was
it
the
white
and
raging
waters
were
blotted
out
and
even
the
lightning
seemed
unable
to
penetrate
that
intense
blackness
a
large
warm
drop
of
rain
fell
upon
rex
outstretched
hand
and
far
overhead
rumbled
a
wrathful
peal
of
thunder
the
shrieking
which
he
had
heard
a
few
moments
ago
had
ceased
but
every
now
and
then
dull
but
immense
shocks
as
of
some
mighty
bird
flapping
the
cliff
with
monstrous
wings
reverberated
around
him
and
shook
the
ground
where
he
stood
he
looked
towards
the
ocean
and
a
tall
misty
form
white
against
the
blackness
beckoned
and
bowed
to
him
he
saw
it
distinctly
for
an
instant
and
then
with
an
awful
shriek
as
of
wrathful
despair
it
sank
and
vanished
maddened
with
a
terror
he
could
not
define
the
hunted
man
turned
to
meet
the
material
peril
that
was
so
close
at
hand
with
a
ferocious
gasp
the
dog
flung
himself
upon
him
john
rex
was
borne
backwards
but
in
his
desperation
he
clutched
the
beast
by
the
throat
and
belly
and
exerting
all
his
strength
flung
him
off
the
brute
uttered
one
howl
and
seemed
to
lie
where
he
had
fallen
while
above
his
carcase
again
hovered
that
white
and
vaporous
column
it
was
strange
that
mcnab
and
the
soldier
did
not
follow
up
the
advantage
they
had
gained
courage
perhaps
he
should
defeat
them
yet
he
had
been
lucky
to
dispose
of
the
dog
so
easily
with
a
fierce
thrill
of
renewed
hope
he
ran
forward
when
at
his
feet
in
his
face
arose
that
misty
form
breathing
chill
warning
as
though
to
wave
him
back
the
terror
at
his
heels
drove
him
on
a
few
steps
more
and
he
should
gain
the
summit
of
the
cliff
he
could
feel
the
sea
roaring
in
front
of
him
in
the
gloom
the
column
disappeared
and
in
a
lull
of
wind
uprose
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
such
a
hideous
medley
of
shrieks
laughter
and
exultant
wrath
that
john
rex
paused
in
horror
too
late
the
ground
gave
way
it
seemed
beneath
his
feet
he
was
falling
clutching
in
vain
at
rocks
shrubs
and
grass
the
lifted
and
by
the
lightning
that
leaped
and
played
about
the
ocean
john
rex
found
an
explanation
of
his
terrors
more
terrible
than
they
themselves
had
been
the
track
he
had
followed
led
to
that
portion
of
the
cliff
in
which
the
sea
had
excavated
the
known
as
the
devil
clinging
to
a
tree
that
growing
down
the
precipice
had
arrested
his
course
he
stared
into
the
abyss
before
him
already
high
above
his
head
was
a
gigantic
arch
of
cliff
through
this
arch
he
saw
at
an
immense
distance
below
him
the
raging
and
pallid
ocean
beneath
him
was
an
abyss
splintered
with
black
rocks
turbid
and
raucous
with
tortured
water
suddenly
the
bottom
of
this
abyss
seemed
to
advance
to
meet
him
or
rather
the
black
throat
of
the
chasm
belched
a
volume
of
leaping
curling
water
which
mounted
to
drown
him
was
it
fancy
that
showed
him
on
the
surface
of
the
rising
column
the
mangled
carcase
of
the
dog
the
chasm
into
which
john
rex
had
fallen
was
shaped
like
a
huge
funnel
set
up
on
its
narrow
end
the
sides
of
this
funnel
were
rugged
rock
and
in
the
banks
of
earth
lodged
here
and
there
upon
projections
a
scrubby
vegetation
grew
the
scanty
growth
paused
abruptly
down
the
gulf
and
the
rock
below
was
perpetually
damp
from
the
upthrown
spray
accident
had
the
convict
been
a
meekin
we
might
term
it
providence
had
lodged
him
on
the
lowest
of
these
banks
of
earth
in
calm
weather
he
would
have
been
out
of
danger
but
the
lightning
flash
revealed
to
his
sense
a
black
patch
of
dripping
rock
on
the
side
of
the
chasm
some
ten
feet
above
his
head
it
was
evident
that
upon
the
next
rising
of
the
the
place
where
he
stood
would
be
covered
with
water
the
roaring
column
mounted
with
hideous
swiftness
rex
felt
it
rush
at
him
and
swing
him
upward
with
both
arms
round
the
tree
he
clutched
the
sleeves
of
his
jacket
with
either
hand
perhaps
if
he
could
maintain
his
hold
he
might
outlive
the
shock
of
that
suffocating
torrent
he
felt
his
feet
rudely
seized
as
though
by
the
hand
of
a
giant
and
plucked
upwards
water
gurgled
in
his
ears
his
arms
seemed
about
to
be
torn
from
their
sockets
had
the
strain
lasted
another
instant
he
must
have
loosed
his
hold
but
with
a
wild
hoarse
shriek
as
though
it
was
some
baffled
of
its
prey
the
column
sank
and
left
him
gasping
bleeding
but
alive
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
survive
another
shock
and
in
his
agony
he
unclasped
his
stiffened
fingers
determined
to
resign
himself
to
his
fate
at
that
instant
however
he
saw
on
the
wall
of
rock
that
hollowed
on
his
right
hand
a
red
and
lurid
light
in
the
midst
of
which
fantastically
bobbed
hither
and
thither
the
gigantic
shadow
of
a
man
he
cast
his
eyes
upwards
and
saw
slowly
descending
into
the
gulf
a
blazing
bush
tied
to
a
rope
mcnab
was
taking
advantage
of
the
pause
in
the
spouting
to
examine
the
sides
of
the
a
despairing
hope
seized
john
rex
in
another
instant
the
light
would
reveal
his
figure
clinging
like
a
limpet
to
the
rock
to
those
above
he
must
be
detected
in
any
case
but
if
they
could
lower
the
rope
sufficiently
he
might
clutch
it
and
be
saved
his
dread
of
the
horrible
death
that
was
beneath
him
overcame
his
resolution
to
avoid
recapture
the
agony
of
the
retreating
water
as
it
was
sucked
back
again
into
the
throat
of
the
chasm
had
ceased
and
he
knew
that
the
next
tremendous
pulsation
of
the
sea
below
would
hurl
the
spuming
destruction
up
upon
him
the
gigantic
torch
slowly
descended
and
he
had
already
drawn
in
his
breath
for
a
shout
which
should
make
itself
heard
above
the
roar
of
the
wind
and
water
when
a
strange
appearance
on
the
face
of
the
cliff
made
him
pause
about
six
feet
from
him
glowing
like
molten
gold
in
the
gusty
glow
of
the
burning
tree
a
round
sleek
stream
of
water
slipped
from
the
rock
into
the
darkness
like
a
serpent
from
its
hole
above
this
stream
a
dark
spot
defied
the
torchlight
and
john
rex
felt
his
heart
leap
with
one
last
desperate
hope
as
he
comprehended
that
close
to
him
was
one
of
those
tortuous
drives
which
the
action
of
the
sea
bores
in
such
caverns
as
that
in
which
he
found
himself
the
drive
opened
first
to
the
light
of
the
day
by
the
natural
convulsion
which
had
raised
the
mountain
itself
above
ocean
level
probably
extended
into
the
bowels
of
the
cliff
the
stream
ceased
to
let
itself
out
of
the
crevice
it
was
then
likely
that
the
rising
column
of
water
did
not
penetrate
far
into
this
wonderful
endowed
with
a
wisdom
which
in
one
placed
in
less
desperate
position
would
have
been
madness
john
rex
shouted
to
his
pursuers
the
rope
the
rope
the
words
projected
against
the
sides
of
the
enormous
funnel
were
pitched
high
above
the
blast
and
reduplicated
by
a
thousand
echoes
reached
the
ears
of
those
above
he
alive
cried
mcnab
peering
into
the
abyss
i
see
him
look
the
soldier
whipped
the
end
of
the
lariat
round
the
tree
to
which
he
held
and
began
to
oscillate
it
so
that
the
blazing
bush
might
reach
the
ledge
on
which
the
daring
convict
sustained
himself
the
groan
which
preceded
the
fierce
belching
forth
of
the
torrent
was
cast
up
to
them
from
below
god
be
gude
to
the
puir
felly
said
the
pious
young
scotchman
catching
his
breath
a
white
spume
was
visible
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
and
the
groan
changed
into
a
rapidly
increasing
bellow
john
rex
eyeing
the
blazing
pendulum
that
with
longer
and
longer
swing
momentarily
neared
him
looked
up
to
the
black
heaven
for
the
last
time
with
a
muttered
prayer
the
bush
the
flame
fanned
by
the
motion
flung
a
crimson
glow
upon
his
frowning
features
which
as
he
caught
the
rope
had
a
sneer
of
triumph
on
them
slack
out
slack
out
he
cried
and
then
drawing
the
burning
bush
towards
him
attempted
to
stamp
out
the
fire
with
his
feet
the
soldier
set
his
body
against
the
tree
trunk
and
gripped
the
rope
hard
turning
his
head
away
from
the
fiery
pit
below
him
hold
tight
your
honour
he
muttered
to
mcnab
she
coming
the
bellow
changed
into
a
roar
the
roar
into
a
shriek
and
with
a
gust
of
wind
and
spray
the
seething
sea
leapt
up
out
of
the
gulf
john
rex
unable
to
extinguish
the
flame
twisted
his
arm
about
the
rope
and
the
instant
before
the
surface
of
the
rising
water
made
a
momentary
floor
to
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
he
spurned
the
cliff
desperately
with
his
feet
and
flung
himself
across
the
chasm
he
had
already
clutched
the
rock
and
thrust
himself
forward
when
the
tremendous
volume
of
water
struck
him
mcnab
and
the
soldier
felt
the
sudden
pluck
of
the
rope
and
saw
the
light
swing
across
the
abyss
then
the
fury
of
the
waterspout
burst
with
a
triumphant
scream
the
tension
ceased
the
light
was
blotted
out
and
when
the
column
sank
there
dangled
at
the
end
of
the
lariat
nothing
but
the
drenched
and
blackened
skeleton
of
the
bough
amid
a
terrific
peal
of
thunder
the
long
rain
descended
and
a
sudden
ghastly
rending
asunder
of
the
clouds
showed
far
below
them
the
heaving
ocean
high
above
them
the
jagged
and
glistening
rocks
and
at
their
feet
the
black
and
murderous
abyss
of
the
blowhole
empty
they
pulled
up
the
useless
rope
in
silence
and
another
dead
tree
lighted
and
lowered
showed
them
nothing
god
rest
his
puir
soul
said
mcnab
shuddering
he
out
o
our
chapter
xxv
the
flight
gabbett
guided
by
the
crow
had
determined
to
beach
the
captured
boat
on
the
southern
point
of
cape
surville
it
will
be
seen
by
those
who
have
followed
the
description
of
the
topography
of
colonel
penitentiary
that
nothing
but
the
desperate
nature
of
the
attempt
could
have
justified
so
desperate
a
measure
the
perpendicular
cliffs
seemed
to
render
such
an
attempt
certain
destruction
but
vetch
who
had
been
employed
in
building
the
pier
at
the
neck
knew
that
on
the
southern
point
of
the
promontory
was
a
strip
of
beach
upon
which
the
company
might
by
good
fortune
land
in
safety
with
something
of
the
decision
of
his
leader
rex
the
crow
determined
at
once
that
in
their
desperate
plight
this
was
the
only
measure
and
setting
his
teeth
as
he
seized
the
oar
that
served
as
a
rudder
he
put
the
boat
head
straight
for
the
huge
rock
that
formed
the
northern
horn
of
pirates
bay
save
for
the
faint
phosphorescent
radiance
of
the
foaming
waves
the
darkness
was
intense
and
burgess
for
some
minutes
pulled
almost
at
random
in
pursuit
the
same
tremendous
flash
of
lightning
which
had
saved
the
life
of
mcnab
by
causing
rex
to
miss
his
aim
showed
to
the
commandant
the
balanced
on
the
summit
of
an
enormous
wave
and
apparently
about
to
be
flung
against
the
wall
of
rock
which
magnified
in
the
flash
seemed
frightfully
near
to
them
the
next
instant
burgess
himself
his
boat
lifted
by
the
swiftly
advancing
billow
saw
a
wild
waste
of
raging
seas
scooped
into
abysmal
troughs
in
which
the
bulk
of
a
leviathan
might
wallow
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
these
valleys
of
water
lay
the
mutineers
boat
looking
with
its
outspread
oars
like
some
insect
floating
in
a
pool
of
ink
the
great
cliff
whose
every
scar
and
crag
was
as
distinct
as
though
its
huge
bulk
was
but
a
yard
distant
seemed
to
shoot
out
from
its
base
towards
the
struggling
insect
a
broad
flat
straw
that
was
a
strip
of
dry
land
the
next
instant
the
rushing
water
carrying
the
atom
with
it
creamed
up
over
this
strip
of
beach
the
giant
crag
amid
the
which
followed
upon
the
lightning
appeared
to
stoop
down
over
the
ocean
and
as
it
stooped
the
billow
rolled
onwards
the
boat
glided
down
into
the
depths
and
the
whole
phantasmagoria
was
swallowed
up
in
the
tumultuous
darkness
of
the
tempest
burgess
his
hair
bristling
with
terror
shouted
to
put
the
boat
about
but
he
might
with
as
much
reason
have
shouted
at
an
avalanche
the
wind
blew
his
voice
away
and
emptied
it
violently
into
the
air
a
snarling
billow
jerked
the
oar
from
his
hand
despite
the
desperate
efforts
of
the
soldiers
the
boat
was
whirled
up
the
mountain
of
water
like
a
leaf
on
a
and
a
second
flash
of
lightning
showed
them
what
seemed
a
group
of
dolls
struggling
in
the
surf
and
a
bottom
upwards
was
driven
by
the
recoil
of
the
waves
towards
them
for
an
instant
all
thought
that
they
must
share
the
fate
which
had
overtaken
the
unlucky
convicts
but
burgess
succeeded
in
trimming
the
boat
and
awed
by
the
peril
he
had
so
narrowly
escaped
gave
the
order
to
return
as
the
men
set
the
boat
head
to
the
welcome
line
of
lights
that
marked
the
neck
a
black
spot
balanced
upon
a
black
line
was
swept
under
their
stern
and
carried
out
to
sea
as
it
passed
them
this
black
spot
emitted
a
cry
and
they
knew
that
it
was
one
of
the
shattered
boat
crew
clinging
to
an
oar
he
was
the
only
one
of
alive
said
burgess
bandaging
his
sprained
wrist
two
hours
afterwards
at
the
neck
and
he
food
for
the
fishes
by
this
time
he
was
mistaken
however
fate
had
in
reserve
for
the
crew
of
villains
a
less
merciful
death
than
that
of
drowning
aided
by
the
lightning
and
that
wonderful
good
luck
which
urges
villainy
to
its
destruction
vetch
beached
the
boat
and
the
party
bruised
and
bleeding
reached
the
upper
portion
of
the
shore
in
safety
of
all
this
number
only
cox
was
lost
he
was
pulling
and
being
something
of
a
laggard
stood
in
the
way
of
the
crow
who
seeing
the
importance
of
haste
in
preserving
his
own
skin
plucked
the
man
backwards
by
the
collar
and
passed
over
his
sprawling
body
to
the
shore
cox
grasping
at
anything
to
save
himself
clutched
an
oar
and
the
next
moment
found
himself
borne
out
with
the
overturned
by
the
he
was
drifted
past
his
only
hope
of
rescue
the
with
a
velocity
that
forbade
all
attempts
at
rescue
and
almost
before
the
poor
scoundrel
had
time
to
realize
his
condition
he
was
in
the
best
possible
way
of
escaping
the
hanging
that
his
comrades
had
so
often
humorously
prophesied
for
him
being
a
strong
and
vigorous
villain
however
he
clung
tenaciously
to
his
oar
and
even
unbuckling
his
leather
belt
passed
it
round
the
slip
of
wood
that
was
his
salvation
girding
himself
to
it
as
firmly
as
he
was
able
in
this
condition
plus
a
swoon
from
exhaustion
he
was
descried
by
the
helmsman
of
the
pretty
mary
a
few
miles
from
cape
surville
at
daylight
next
morning
blunt
with
a
wild
hope
that
this
waif
and
stray
might
be
the
lover
of
sarah
purfoy
dead
lowered
a
boat
and
picked
him
up
nearly
bisected
by
the
belt
gorged
with
salt
water
frozen
with
cold
and
having
two
ribs
broken
the
victim
of
vetch
murderous
quickness
retained
sufficient
life
to
survive
blunt
remedies
for
nearly
two
hours
during
that
time
he
stated
that
his
name
was
cox
that
he
had
escaped
from
port
arthur
with
eight
others
that
john
rex
was
the
leader
of
the
expedition
that
the
others
were
all
drowned
and
that
he
believed
john
rex
had
been
retaken
having
placed
blunt
in
possession
of
these
particulars
he
further
said
that
it
pricked
him
to
breathe
cursed
jemmy
vetch
the
settlement
and
the
sea
and
so
impenitently
died
blunt
smoked
three
pipes
and
then
altered
the
course
of
the
pretty
mary
two
points
to
the
eastward
and
ran
for
the
coast
it
was
possible
that
the
man
for
whom
he
was
searching
had
not
been
retaken
and
was
even
now
awaiting
his
arrival
it
was
clearly
his
duty
hearing
of
the
planned
escape
having
been
actually
attempted
not
to
give
up
the
expedition
while
hope
remained
i
take
one
more
look
along
said
he
to
himself
the
pretty
mary
hugging
the
coast
as
closely
as
she
dared
crawled
in
the
thin
breeze
all
day
and
saw
nothing
it
would
be
madness
to
land
at
cape
surville
for
the
whole
station
would
be
on
the
alert
so
blunt
as
night
was
falling
stood
off
a
little
across
the
mouth
of
pirates
bay
he
was
walking
the
deck
groaning
at
the
folly
of
the
expedition
when
a
strange
appearance
on
the
southern
horn
of
the
bay
made
him
come
to
a
sudden
halt
there
was
a
furnace
blazing
in
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
blunt
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
he
looked
at
the
man
at
the
helm
do
you
see
anything
yonder
jem
jem
a
sydney
man
who
had
never
been
round
that
coast
before
briefly
remarked
blunt
stumped
into
the
cabin
and
got
out
his
charts
no
lighthouse
was
laid
down
there
only
a
mark
like
an
anchor
and
a
note
remarkable
hole
at
this
a
remarkable
hole
indeed
a
remarkable
lime
kiln
would
have
been
more
to
the
purpose
blunt
called
up
his
mate
william
staples
a
fellow
whom
sarah
gold
had
bought
body
and
soul
william
staples
looked
at
the
waxing
and
waning
glow
for
a
while
and
then
said
in
tones
trembling
with
greed
it
a
fire
lie
to
and
lower
away
the
old
man
that
our
bird
for
a
thousand
pounds
the
pretty
mary
shortened
sail
and
blunt
and
staples
got
into
the
goin
sir
said
one
of
the
crew
with
a
grin
as
blunt
threw
a
bundle
into
the
staples
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
the
object
of
the
voyage
was
now
pretty
well
understood
among
the

there

the

off

lay
on

and
listened
the
night
was
moonless
and
the
ship
had
already
disappeared
from
view
they
were
approaching
the
promontory
from
the
and
this
isthmus
of
the
guarded
neck
was
hidden
by
the
outlying
cliff
in
the
angle
of
this
cliff
about
midway
between
the
summit
and
the
sea
was
an
arch
which
vomited
a
red
and
flickering
light
that
faintly
shone
upon
the
sea
in
the
track
of
the
boat
the
light
was
lambent
and
uncertain
now
sinking
almost
into
insignificance
and
now
leaping
up
with
a
fierceness
that
caused
a
deep
glow
to
throb
in
the
very
heart
of
the
mountain
sometimes
a
black
figure
would
pass
across
this
gigantic
stooping
and
rising
as
though
feeding
the
fire
one
might
have
imagined
that
a
door
in
vulcan

had
been
left
inadvertently
open

that
the

chapter

the
work
of
the
sea
the
lift
of
the
had
saved
john
rex
life
at
the
moment
when
it
struck
him
he
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
at
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
the
wave
gushing
upwards
at
the
same
time
expanded
laterally
and
this
lateral
force
drove
the
convict
into
the
mouth
of
the
subterranean
passage
the
passage
trended
downwards
and
for
some
seconds
he
was
rolled
over
and
over
the
rush
of
water
wedging
him
at
length
into
a
crevice
between
two
enormous
stones
which
overhung
a
still
more
formidable
abyss
fortunately
for
the
preservation
of
his
life
this
very
fury
of
incoming
water
prevented
him
from
being
washed
out
again
with
the
recoil
of
the
wave
he
could
hear
the
water
dashing
with
frightful
echoes
far
down
into
the
depths
beyond
him
but
it
was
evident
that
the
two
stones
against
which
he
had
been
thrust
acted
as
breakwaters
to
the
torrent
poured
in
from
the
outside
and
repelled
the
main
body
of
the
stream
in
the
fashion
he
had
observed
from
his
position
on
the
ledge
in
a
few
seconds
the
cavern
was
empty
painfully
extricating
himself
and
feeling
as
yet
doubtful
of
his
safety
john
rex
essayed
to
climb
the
that
barred
the
unknown
depths
below
him
the
first
movement
he
made
caused
him
to
shriek
aloud
his
left
arm
with
which
he
clung
to
the
rope
hung
powerless
ground
against
the
ragged
entrance
it
was
momentarily
paralysed
for
an
instant
the
unfortunate
wretch
sank
despairingly
on
the
wet
and
rugged
floor
of
the
cave
then
a
terrible
gurgling
beneath
his
feet
warned
him
of
the
approaching
torrent
and
collecting
all
his
energies
he
scrambled
up
the
incline
though
nigh
fainting
with
pain
and
exhaustion
he
pressed
desperately
higher
and
higher
he
heard
the
hideous
shriek
of
the
whirlpool
which
was
beneath
him
grow
louder
and
louder
he
saw
the
darkness
grow
darker
as
the
rising
covered
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
felt
the
salt
spray
sting
his
face
and
the
wrathful
tide
lick
the
hand
that
hung
over
the
shelf
on
which
he
fell
but
that
was
all
he
was
out
of
danger
at
last
and
as
the
thought
blessed
his
senses
his
eyes
closed
and
the
wonderful
courage
and
strength
which
had
sustained
the
villain
so
long
exhaled
in
stupor
when
he
awoke
the
cavern
was
filled
with
the
soft
light
of
dawn
raising
his
eyes
he
beheld
high
above
his
head
a
roof
of
rock
on
which
the
reflection
of
the
sunbeams
playing
upwards
through
a
pool
of
water
cast
flickering
colours
on
his
right
hand
was
the
mouth
of
the
cave
on
his
left
a
terrific
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
he
could
hear
the
sea
faintly
lapping
and
washing
he
raised
himself
and
stretched
his
stiffened
limbs
despite
his
injured
shoulder
it
was
imperative
that
he
should
bestir
himself
he
knew
not
if
his
escape
had
been
noticed
or
if
the
cavern
had
another
inlet
by
which
mcnab
returning
might
penetrate
moreover
he
was
wet
and
famished
to
preserve
the
life
which
he
had
torn
from
the
sea
he
must
have
fire
and
food
first
he
examined
the
crevice
by
which
he
had
entered
it
was
shaped
like
an
irregular
triangle
hollowed
at
the
base
by
the
action
of
the
water
which
in
such
storms
as
that
of
the
preceding
night
was
forced
into
it
by
the
rising
of
the
sea
john
rex
dared
not
crawl
too
near
the
edge
lest
he
should
slide
out
of
the
damp
and
slippery
orifice
and
be
dashed
upon
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
craning
his
neck
he
could
see
a
hundred
feet
below
him
the
sullenly
frothing
water
gurgling
spouting
and
creaming
in
huge
turbid
eddies
occasionally
leaping
upwards
as
though
it
longed
for
another
storm
to
send
it
raging
up
to
the
man
who
had
escaped
its
fury
it
was
impossible
to
get
down
that
way
he
turned
back
into
the
cavern
and
began
to
explore
in
that
direction
the
against
which
he
had
been
hurled
were
in
fact
pillars
which
supported
the
roof
of
the
beyond
them
lay
a
great
grey
shadow
which
was
emptiness
faintly
illumined
by
the
cast
up
through
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
midway
across
the
grey
shadow
fell
a
strange
beam
of
dusky
brilliance
which
cast
its
flickering
light
upon
a
wilderness
of
waving
even
in
the
desperate
position
in
which
he
found
himself
there
survived
in
the
vagabond
nature
sufficient
poetry
to
make
him
value
the
natural
marvel
upon
which
he
had
so
strangely
stumbled
the
immense
promontory
which
viewed
from
the
outside
seemed
as
solid
as
a
mountain
was
in
reality
but
a
hollow
cone
reft
and
split
into
a
thousand
fissures
by
the
unsuspected
action
of
the
sea
for
centuries
the
was
but
an
insignificant
cranny
compared
with
this
enormous
chasm
descending
with
difficulty
the
steep
incline
he
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
a
gallery
of
rock
which
jutting
out
over
the
pool
bore
on
its
moist
and
edges
signs
of
frequent
submersion
it
must
be
low
tide
without
the
rock
clinging
to
the
rough
and
algae
that
fringed
the
walls
john
rex
crept
round
the
projection
of
the
gallery
and
passed
at
once
from
dimness
to
daylight
there
was
a
broad
in
the
side
of
the
and
cliff
the
cloudless
heaven
expanded
above
him
a
fresh
breeze
kissed
his
cheek
and
sixty
feet
below
him
the
sea
wrinkled
all
its
lazy
length
sparkling
in
myriad
wavelets
beneath
the
bright
beams
of
morning
not
a
sign
of
the
recent
tempest
marred
the
exquisite
harmony
of
the
picture
not
a
sign
of
human
life
gave
evidence
of
the
grim
neighbourhood
of
the
prison
from
the
recess
out
of
which
he
peered
nothing
was
visible
but
a
sky
of
turquoise
smiling
upon
a
sea
of
sapphire
the
placidity
of
nature
was
however
to
the
hunted
convict
a
new
source
of
alarm
it
was
a
reason
why
the
and
its
neighbourhood
should
be
thoroughly
searched
he
guessed
that
the
favourable
weather
would
be
an
additional
inducement
to
mcnab
and
burgess
to
satisfy
themselves
as
to
the
fate
of
their
late
prisoner
he
turned
from
the
opening
and
prepared
to
descend
still
farther
into
the
rock
pathway
the
sunshine
had
revived
and
cheered
him
and
a
sort
of
instinct
told
him
that
the
cliff
so
above
could
not
be
without
some
gully
or
chink
at
its
base
which
at
low
tide
would
give
upon
the
rocky
shore
it
grew
darker
as
he
descended
and
twice
he
almost
turned
back
in
dread
of
the
gulfs
on
either
side
of
him
it
seemed
to
him
also
that
the
gullet
of
rock
through
which
he
was
crawling
doubled
upon
itself
and
led
only
into
the
bowels
of
the
mountain
gnawed
by
hunger
and
conscious
that
in
a
few
hours
at
most
the
rising
tide
would
fill
the
subterranean
passage
and
cut
off
his
retreat
he
pushed
desperately
onwards
he
had
descended
some
ninety
feet
and
had
lost
in
the
devious
windings
of
his
downward
path
all
but
the
reflection
of
the
light
from
the
gallery
when
he
was
rewarded
by
a
glimpse
of
sunshine
striking
upwards
he
parted
two
enormous
masses
of
seaweed
whose
fronds
hung
curtainwise
across
his
path
and
found
himself
in
the
very
middle
of
the
narrow
cleft
of
rock
through
which
the
sea
was
driven
to
the
at
an
immense
distance
above
him
was
the
arch
of
cliff
beyond
that
arch
appeared
a
segment
of
the
ragged
edge
of
the
circular
opening
down
which
he
had
fallen
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
whose
friendly
shelter
had
received
him
it
was
now
indistinguishable
at
his
feet
was
a
long
rift
in
the
solid
rock
so
narrow
that
he
could
almost
have
leapt
across
it
this
rift
was
the
channel
of
a
swift
black
current
which
ran
from
the
sea
for
fifty
yards
under
an
arch
eight
feet
high
until
it
broke
upon
the
jagged
rocks
that
lay
blistering
in
the
sunshine
at
the
bottom
of
the
circular
opening
in
the
upper
cliff
a
shudder
shook
the
limbs
of
the
adventurous
convict
he
comprehended
that
at
high
tide
the
place
where
he
stood
was
under
water
and
that
the
narrow
cavern
became
a
subaqueous
pipe
of
solid
rock
forty
feet
long
through
which
were
spouted
the
rollers
of
the
southern
sea
the
narrow
strip
of
rock
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
was
as
flat
as
a
table
here
and
there
were
enormous
hollows
like
pans
which
the
retreating
tide
had
left
full
of
clear
still
water
the
crannies
of
the
rock
were
inhabited
by
small
white
crabs
and
john
rex
found
to
his
delight
that
there
was
on
this
little
shelf
abundance
of
mussels
which
though
lean
and
acrid
were
sufficiently
grateful
to
his
famished
stomach
attached
to
the
flat
surfaces
of
the
numerous
stones
moreover
were
coarse
limpets
these
however
john
rex
found
too
salt
to
be
palatable
and
was
compelled
to
reject
them
a
larger
variety
however
having
a
succulent
body
as
thick
as
a
man
thumb
contained
in
long
shells
were
in
some
degree
free
from
this
objection
and
he
soon
collected
the
materials
for
a
meal
having
eaten
and
sunned
himself
he
began
to
examine
the
enormous
rock
to
the
base
of
which
he
had
so
strangely
penetrated
rugged
and
worn
it
raised
its
huge
breast
against
wind
and
wave
secure
upon
a
broad
pedestal
which
probably
extended
as
far
beneath
the
sea
as
the
massive
column
itself
rose
above
it
rising
thus
with
its
shaggy
drapery
of
seaweed
clinging
about
its
knees
it
seemed
to
be
a
motionless
but
sentient
being
some
monster
of
the
deep
a
titan
of
the
ocean
condemned
ever
to
front
in
silence
the
fury
of
that
illimitable
and
sea
yet
silent
and
motionless
as
he
was
the
hoary
ancient
gave
hint
of
the
mysteries
of
his
revenge
standing
upon
the
broad
and
platform
where
surely
no
human
foot
but
his
had
ever
stood
in
life
the
convict
saw
many
feet
above
him
pitched
into
a
cavity
of
the
huge
boulders
an
object
which
his
sailor
eye
told
him
at
once
was
part
of
the
top
hamper
of
some
large
ship
crusted
with
shells
and
its
ruin
so
overrun
with
the
ivy
of
the
ocean
that
its
ropes
could
barely
be
distinguished
from
the
weeds
with
which
they
were
encumbered
this
relic
of
human
labour
attested
the
triumph
of
nature
over
human
ingenuity
perforated
below
by
the
relentless
sea
exposed
above
to
the
full
fury
of
the
tempest
set
in
solitary
defiance
to
the
waves
that
rolling
from
the
of
the
southern
pole
hurled
their
gathered
might
unchecked
upon
its
iron
front
the
great
rock
drew
from
its
lonely
warfare
the
materials
of
its
own
silent
vengeance
clasped
in
iron
arms
it
held
its
prey
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
the
sea
one
might
imagine
that
when
the
doomed
ship
with
her
crew
of
shrieking
souls
had
splintered
and
gone
down
the
deaf
blind
giant
had
clutched
this
fragment
upheaved
from
the
seething
waters
with
a
thrill
of
savage
and
terrible
joy
john
rex
gazing
up
at
this
memento
of
a
forgotten
agony
felt
a
sensation
of
the
most
vulgar
pleasure
there
wood
for
my
fire
thought
he
and
mounting
to
the
spot
he
essayed
to
fling
down
the
splinters
of
timber
upon
the
platform
long
exposed
to
the
sun
and
flung
high
above
the
of
recent
storms
the
timber
had
dried
to
the
condition
of
touchwood
and
would
burn
fiercely
it
was
precisely
what
he
required
strange
accident
that
had
for
years
stored
upon
a
desolate
rock
this
fragment
of
a
vanished
and
vessel
that
it
might
aid
at
last
to
warm
the
limbs
of
a
villain
escaping
from
justice
striking
the
disintegrated
mass
with
his
heel
john
rex
broke
off
convenient
portions
and
making
a
bag
of
his
shirt
by
tying
the
sleeves
and
neck
he
was
speedily
staggering
into
the
cavern
with
a
supply
of
fuel
he
made
two
trips
flinging
down
the
wood
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
that
overlooked
the
sea
and
was
returning
for
a
third
when
his
quick
ear
caught
the
dip
of
oars
he
had
barely
time
to
lift
the
seaweed
curtain
that
veiled
the
entrance
to
the
chasm
when
the
eaglehawk
boat
rounded
the
promontory
burgess
was
in
the
and
seemed
to
be
making
signals
to
someone
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
rex
grinning
behind
his
veil
divined
the
manoeuvre
mcnab
and
his
party
were
to
search
above
while
the
commandant
examined
the
gulf
below
the
boat
headed
direct
for
the
passage
and
for
an
instant
john
undaunted
soul
shivered
at
the
thought
that
perhaps
after
all
his
pursuers
might
be
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
cavern
yet
that
was
unlikely
he
kept
his
ground
and
the
boat
passed
within
a
foot
of
him
gliding
silently
into
the
gulf
he
observed
that
burgess
usually
florid
face
was
pale
and
that
his
left
sleeve
was
cut
open
showing
a
bandage
on
the
arm
there
had
been
some
fighting
then
and
it
was
not
unlikely
that
all
his
had
been
captured
he
chuckled
at
his
own
ingenuity
and
good
sense
the
boat
emerging
from
the
archway
entered
the
pool
of
the
and
held
with
the
full
strength
of
the
party
remained
stationary
john
rex
watched
burgess
scan
the
rocks
and
eddies
saw
him
signal
to
mcnab
and
then
with
much
relief
beheld
the
boat
head
brought
round
to
the
he
was
so
intent
upon
watching
this
dangerous
and
difficult
operation
that
he
was
oblivious
of
an
extraordinary
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
interior
of
the
cavern
the
water
which
an
hour
ago
had
left
exposed
a
long
reef
of
black
was
now
spread
in
one
sheet
over
the
ragged
bottom
of
the
rude
staircase
by
which
he
had
descended
the
tide
had
turned
and
the
sea
apparently
sucked
in
through
some
deeper
tunnel
in
the
portion
of
the
cliff
which
was
below
water
was
being
forced
into
the
vault
with
a
rapidity
which
bid
fair
to
shortly
submerge
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
convict
feet
were
already
wetted
by
the
incoming
waves
and
as
he
turned
for
one
last
look
at
the
boat
he
saw
a
green
billow
heave
up
against
the
entrance
to
the
chasm
and
almost
blotting
out
the
daylight
roll
majestically
through
the
arch
it
was
high
time
for
burgess
to
take
his
departure
if
he
did
not
wish
his
to
be
cracked
like
a
nut
against
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
alive
to
his
danger
the
commandant
abandoned
the
search
after
his
late
prisoner
corpse
and
he
hastened
to
gain
the
open
sea
the
boat
carried
backwards
and
upwards
on
the
bosom
of
a
monstrous
wave
narrowly
escaped
destruction
and
john
rex
climbing
to
the
gallery
saw
with
much
satisfaction
the
broad
back
of
his
gaoler
disappear
round
the
sheltering
promontory
the
last
efforts
of
his
pursuers
had
failed
and
in
another
hour
the
only
accessible
entrance
to
the
convict
retreat
was
hidden
under
three
feet
of
furious
seawater
his
gaolers
were
convinced
of
his
death
and
would
search
for
him
no
more
so
far
so
good
now
for
the
last
desperate
venture
the
escape
from
the
wonderful
cavern
which
was
at
once
his
shelter
and
his
prison
piling
his
wood
together
and
succeeding
after
many
efforts
by
the
aid
of
a
flint
and
the
ring
which
yet
clung
to
his
ankle
in
lighting
a
fire
and
warming
his
chilled
limbs
in
its
cheering
blaze
he
set
himself
to
meditate
upon
his
course
of
action
he
was
safe
for
the
present
and
the
supply
of
food
that
the
rock
afforded
was
amply
sufficient
to
sustain
life
in
him
for
many
days
but
it
was
impossible
that
he
could
remain
for
many
days
concealed
he
had
no
fresh
water
and
though
by
reason
of
the
soaking
he
had
received
he
had
hitherto
felt
little
inconvenience
from
this
cause
the
salt
and
acrid
mussels
speedily
induced
a
raging
thirst
which
he
could
not
alleviate
it
was
imperative
that
within
hours
at
farthest
he
should
be
on
his
way
to
the
peninsula
he
remembered
the
little
stream
into
which
in
his
flight
of
the
previous
night
he
had
so
nearly
fallen
and
hoped
to
be
able
under
cover
of
the
darkness
to
steal
round
the
reef
and
reach
it
unobserved
his
desperate
scheme
was
then
to
commence
he
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
dogs
and
guards
gain
the
peninsula
and
await
the
rescuing
vessel
he
confessed
to
himself
that
the
chances
were
terribly
against
him
if
gabbett
and
the
others
had
been
recaptured
as
he
devoutly
trusted
the
coast
would
be
comparatively
clear
but
if
they
had
escaped
he
knew
burgess
too
well
to
think
that
he
would
give
up
the
chase
while
hope
of
the
absconders
remained
to
him
if
indeed
all
fell
out
as
he
had
wished
he
had
still
to
sustain
life
until
blunt
found
him
if
haply
blunt
had
not
returned
wearied
with
useless
and
dangerous
waiting
as
night
came
on
and
the
firelight
showed
strange
shadows
waving
from
the
corners
of
the
enormous
vault
while
the
dismal
abysses
beneath
him
murmured
and
muttered
with
uncouth
and
ghastly
utterance
there
fell
upon
the
lonely
man
the
terror
of
solitude
was
this
marvellous
that
he
had
discovered
to
be
his
sepulchre
was
he
a
monster
amongst
his
to
die
some
monstrous
death
entombed
in
this
mysterious
and
terrible
cavern
of
the
sea
he
had
tried
to
drive
away
these
gloomy
thoughts
by
sketching
out
for
himself
a
plan
of
action
but
in
vain
in
vain
he
strove
to
picture
in
its
completeness
that
as
yet
vague
design
by
which
he
promised
himself
to
wrest
from
the
vanished
son
of
the
wealthy
his
name
and
heritage
his
mind
filled
with
forebodings
of
shadowy
horror
could
not
give
the
subject
the
calm
consideration
which
it
needed
in
the
midst
of
his
schemes
for
the
baffling
of
the
jealous
love
of
the
woman
who
was
to
save
him
and
the
getting
to
england
in
shipwrecked
and
foreign
guise
as
the
heir
to
the
fortune
of
sir
richard
devine
there
arose
ghastly
and
awesome
shapes
of
death
and
horror
with
whose
terrible
unsubstantiality
he
must
grapple
in
the
lonely
recesses
of
that
dismal
cavern
he
heaped
fresh
wood
upon
his
fire
that
the
bright
light
might
drive
out
the
gruesome
things
that
lurked
above
below
and
around
him
he
became
afraid
to
look
behind
him
lest
some
shapeless
mass
of
birth
some
voracious
polype
with
arms
and
jellied
mouth
ever
open
to
devour
might
slide
up
over
the
edge
of
the
dripping
caves
below
and
fasten
upon
him
in
the
darkness
his
imagination
always
sufficiently
vivid
and
spurred
to
an
unnatural
effect
by
the
exciting
scenes
of
the
previous
night
painted
each
patch
of
shadow
clinging
to
the
humid
wall
as
some
globular
ready
to
drop
upon
him
with
its
viscid
and
body
and
drain
out
his
chilled
blood
enfolding
him
in
rough
and
hairy
arms
each
splash
in
the
water
beneath
him
each
sigh
of
the
multitudinous
and
melancholy
sea
seemed
to
prelude
the
laborious
advent
of
some
and
ungainly
abortion
of
the
ooze
all
the
sensations
induced
by
lapping
water
and
regurgitating
waves
took
material
shape
and
surrounded
him
all
creatures
that
could
be
engendered
by
slime
and
salt
crept
forth
into
the
firelight
to
stare
at
him
red
dabs
and
splashes
that
were
living
beings
having
a
strange
phosphoric
light
of
their
own
glowed
upon
the
floor
the
livid
encrustations
of
a
hundred
years
of
humidity
slipped
from
off
the
walls
and
painfully
heaved
their
mushroom
surfaces
to
the
blaze
the
red
glow
of
the
unwonted
fire
crimsoning
the
wet
sides
of
the
cavern
seemed
to
attract
countless
blisterous
and
transparent
shapelessnesses
which
elongated
themselves
towards
him
bloodless
and
bladdery
things
ran
hither
and
thither
noiselessly
strange
carapaces
crawled
from
out
of
the
rocks
all
the
horrible
unseen
life
of
the
ocean
seemed
to
be
rising
up
and
surrounding
him
he
retreated
to
the
brink
of
the
gulf
and
the
glare
of
the
upheld
brand
fell
upon
a
rounded
hummock
whose
coronal
of
silky
weed
in
the
water
looked
like
the
head
of
a
drowned
man
he
rushed
to
the
entrance
of
the
gallery
and
his
shadow
thrown
into
the
opening
took
the
shape
of
an
avenging
phantom
with
arms
upraised
to
warn
him
back
the
naturalist
the
explorer
or
the
shipwrecked
seaman
would
have
found
nothing
frightful
in
this
exhibition
of
the
harmless
life
of
the
australian
ocean
but
the
convict
guilty
conscience
long
suppressed
and
derided
asserted
itself
in
this
hour
when
it
was
alone
with
nature
and
night
the
bitter
intellectual
power
which
had
so
long
supported
him
succumbed
beneath
imagination
the
unconscious
religion
of
the
soul
if
ever
he
was
nigh
repentance
it
was
then
phantoms
of
his
past
crimes
gibbered
at
him
and
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hands
he
fell
shuddering
upon
his
knees
the
brand
loosening
from
his
grasp
dropped
into
the
gulf
and
was
extinguished
with
a
hissing
noise
as
if
the
sound
had
called
up
some
spirit
that
lurked
below
a
whisper
ran
through
the
cavern
john
rex
the
hair
on
the
convict
flesh
stood
up
and
he
cowered
to
the
earth
john
rex
it
was
a
human
voice
whether
of
friend
or
enemy
he
did
not
pause
to
think
his
terror
all
other
considerations
here
here
he
cried
and
sprang
to
the
opening
of
the
vault
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
blunt
and
staples
found
themselves
in
almost
complete
darkness
for
the
light
of
the
mysterious
fire
which
had
hitherto
guided
them
had
necessarily
disappeared
calm
as
was
the
night
and
still
as
was
the
ocean
the
sea
yet
ran
with
silent
but
dangerous
strength
through
the
channel
which
led
to
the
and
blunt
instinctively
feeling
the
boat
drawn
towards
some
unknown
peril
held
off
the
shelf
of
rocks
out
of
reach
of
the
current
a
sudden
flash
of
fire
as
from
a
flourished
brand
burst
out
above
them
and
floating
downwards
through
the
darkness
in
erratic
circles
came
an
atom
of
burning
wood
surely
no
one
but
a
hunted
man
would
lurk
in
such
a
savage
retreat
blunt
in
desperate
anxiety
determined
to
risk
all
upon
one
venture
john
rex
he
shouted
up
through
his
rounded
hands
the
light
flashed
again
at
the
of
the
mountain
and
on
the
point
above
them
appeared
a
wild
figure
holding
in
its
hands
a
burning
log
whose
fierce
glow
illumined
a
face
so
contorted
by
deadly
fear
and
agony
of
expectation
that
it
was
scarce
human
here
here
the
poor
devil
seems
said
will
staples
under
his
breath
and
then
aloud
we
friends
a
few
moments
sufficed
to
explain
matters
the
terrors
which
had
oppressed
john
rex
disappeared
in
human
presence
and
the
villain
coolness
returned
kneeling
on
the
rock
platform
he
held
parley
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
come
down
now
he
said
the

out
of
the
ca
you
dive
through
it

staples
no
nor
you
neither
said
rex
shuddering
at
the
thought
of
trusting
himself
to
that
horrible
whirlpool
what
to
be
done
you
ca
come
down
that
wait
until
morning
returned
rex
coolly
it
will
be
dead
low
tide
at
seven
you
must
send
a
boat
at
six
or
it
will
be
low
enough
for
me
to
get
out
i
dare
say
by
that
but
the
guard
wo
come
here
my
man
they
got
their
work
to
do
in
watching
the
neck
and
exploring
after
my
mates
they
wo
come
here
besides
dead
thought
to
be
so
which
is
as
well
better
for
me
perhaps
if
they
do

you

not

when
they
reached

not

adding
with
some
heat
that
the
way
with

they
go
through

for
a

that

care

through

darkness
at
the
place
where
the
fire
had
been

he
did
not

aloud
at
eight
the
next
morning
the

out
to

at

until

bleeding

the

they
come
to
a
sandy
spit
that
runs
out
into

that
they

far
to

the
settlers
and
get
so
passing
the
isthmus
they
strike
into
the
bush
along
the
shore
and
tightening
their
belts
over
their
gnawing
bellies
camp
under
some
hills
the
fourth
day
is
notable
for
the
indisposition
of
bodenham
who
is
a
bad
walker
and
falling
behind
delays
the
party
by
frequent
cooees
gabbett
threatens
him
with
a
worse
fate
than
sore
feet
if
he
lingers
luckily
that
evening
greenhill
espies
a
hut
but
not
trusting
to
the
friendship
of
the
occupant
they
wait
until
he
quits
it
in
the
morning
and
then
send
vetch
to
forage
vetch
secretly
congratulating
himself
on
having
by
his
counsel
prevented
violence
returns
bending
under
half
a
bag
of
flour
you
better
carry
the
flour
said
he
to
gabbett
and
give
me
the
gabbett
eyes
him
for
a
while
as
if
struck
by
his
puny
form
but
finally
gives
the
axe
to
his
mate
sanders
that
day
they
creep
along
cautiously
between
the
sea
and
the
hills
camping
at
a
creek
vetch
after
much
search
finds
a
handful
of
berries
and
adds
them
to
the
main
stock
half
of
this
handful
is
eaten
at
once
the
other
half
reserved
for
the
next
day
they
come
to
an
arm
of
the
sea
and
as
they
struggle
northward
maria
island
disappears
and
with
it
all
danger
from
telescopes
that
evening
they
reach
the
camping
ground
by
twos
and
threes
and
each
wonders
between
the
paroxysms
of
hunger
if
his
face
is
as
haggard
and
his
eyes
as
bloodshot
as
those
of
his
neighbour
on
the
seventh
day
bodenham
says
his
feet
are
so
bad
he
ca
walk
and
greenhill
with
a
greedy
look
at
the
berries
bids
him
stay
behind
being
in
a
very
weak
condition
he
takes
his
companion
at
his
word
and
drops
off
about
noon
the
next
day
gabbett
discovering
this
defection
however
goes
back
and
in
an
hour
or
so
appears
driving
the
wretched
creature
before
him
with
blows
as
a
sheep
is
driven
to
the
shambles
greenhill
remonstrates
at
another
mouth
being
thus
forced
upon
the
party
but
the
giant
silences
him
with
a
hideous
glance
jemmy
vetch
remembers
that
greenhill
accompanied
gabbett
once
before
and
feels
uncomfortable
he
gives
hint
of
his
suspicions
to
sanders
but
sanders
only
laughs
it
is
horribly
evident
that
there
is
an
understanding
among
the
three
the
ninth
sun
of
their
freedom
rising
upon
sandy
and
barren
hillocks
bristling
thick
with
cruel
scrub
sees
the
six
wretches
cursing
their
god
and
yet
afraid
to
die
all
around
is
the
fruitless
shadeless
shelterless
bush
above
the
pitiless
heaven
in
the
distance
the
remorseless
sea
something
terrible
must
happen
that
grey
wilderness
arched
by
grey
heaven
stooping
to
grey
sea
is
a
fitting
keeper
of
hideous
secrets
vetch
suggests
that
oyster
bay
can
not
be
far
to
the
eastward
the
line
of
ocean
is
deceitfully
close
and
though
such
a
proceeding
will
take
them
out
of
their
course
they
resolve
to
make
for
it
after
hobbling
five
miles
they
seem
no
nearer
than
before
and
nigh
dead
with
fatigue
and
starvation
sink
despairingly
upon
the
ground
vetch
thinks
gabbett
eyes
have
a
wolfish
glare
in
them
and
instinctively
draws
off
from
him
said
greenhill
in
the
course
of
a
dismal
conversation
i
am
so
weak
that
i
could
eat
a
piece
of
a
on
the
tenth
day
bodenham
refuses
to
stir
and
the
others
being
scarce
able
to
drag
along
their
limbs
sit
on
the
ground
about
him
greenhill
eyeing
the
prostrate
man
said
slowly
i
have
seen
the
same
done
before
boys
and
it
tasted
like
vetch
hearing
his
savage
comrade
give
utterance
to
a
thought
all
had
secretly
cherished
speaks
out
crying
it
would
be
murder
to
do
it
and
then
perhaps
we
could
eat
oh
said
gabbett
with
a
grin
i
warrant
you
that
but
you
must
all
have
a
hand
in
gabbett
sanders
and
greenhill
then
go
aside
and
presently
sanders
coming
to
the
crow
said
he
consented
to
act
as
flogger
he
deserves
so
did
gabbett
for
that
matter
shudders
vetch
ay
but
bodenham
feet
are
sore
said
sanders
and
is
a
pity
to
leave
having
no
fire
they
make
a
little
breakwind
and
vetch
behind
this
at
about
three
in
the
morning
hears
someone
cry
out
christ
and
awakes
sweating
ice
no
one
but
gabbett
and
greenhill
would
eat
that
night
that
savage
pair
however
make
a
fire
fling
ghastly
fragments
on
the
embers
and
eat
the
broil
before
it
is
right
warm
in
the
morning
the
frightful
carcase
is
divided
that
day
march
takes
place
in
silence
and
at
midday
halt
cornelius
volunteers
to
carry
the
billy
affecting
great
restoration
from
the
food
vetch
gives
it
to
him
and
in
half
an
hour
afterwards
cornelius
is
missing
gabbett
and
greenhill
pursue
him
in
vain
and
return
with
curses
he
die
like
a
dog
said
greenhill
alone
in
the
jemmy
vetch
with
his
intellect
acute
as
ever
thinks
that
cornelius
may
prefer
such
a
death
but
says
nothing
the
twelfth
morning
dawns
wet
and
misty
but
vetch
seeing
the
provision
running
short
strives
to
be
cheerful
telling
stories
of
men
who
have
escaped
greater
peril
vetch
feels
with
dismay
that
he
is
the
weakest
of
the
party
but
has
some
sort
of
consolation
in
remembering
that
he
is
also
the
leanest
they
come
to
a
creek
that
afternoon
and
look
until
nightfall
in
vain
for
a
the
next
day
gabbett
and
vetch
swim
across
and
vetch
directs
gabbett
to
cut
a
long
sapling
which
being
stretched
across
the
water
is
seized
by
greenhill
and
the
moocher
who
are
dragged
over
what
would
you
do
without
me
said
the
crow
with
a
ghastly
grin
they
can
not
kindle
a
fire
for
greenhill
who
carries
the
tinder
has
allowed
it
to
get
wet
the
giant
swings
his
axe
in
savage
anger
at
enforced
cold
and
vetch
takes
an
opportunity
to
remark
privately
to
him
what
a
big
man
greenhill
is
on
the
fourteenth
day
they
can
scarcely
crawl
and
their
limbs
pain
them
greenhill
who
is
the
weakest
sees
gabbett
and
the
moocher
go
aside
to
consult
and
crawling
to
the
crow
whimpers
for
god
sake
jemmy
do
let
murder
me
i
ca
help
you
says
vetch
looking
about
in
terror
think
of
poor
tom
but
he
was
no
murderer
if
they
kill
me
i
shall
go
to
hell
with
blood
on
my
he
writhes
on
the
ground
in
sickening
terror
and
gabbett
arriving
bids
vetch
bring
wood
for
the
fire
vetch
going
sees
greenhill
clinging
to
wolfish
gabbett
knees
and
sanders
calls
after
him
you
will
hear
it
presently
the
nervous
crow
puts
his
hand
to
his
ears
but
is
conscious
of
a
dull
crash
and
a
groan
when
he
comes
back
gabbett
is
putting
on
the
dead
man
shoes
which
are
better
than
his
own
we
stop
here
a
day
or
so
and
rest
said
he
now
we
got
two
more
days
pass
and
the
three
eyeing
each
other
suspiciously
resume
their
march
the
third
day
the
sixteenth
of
their
awful
journey
such
portions
of
the
carcase
as
they
have
with
them
prove
unfit
to
eat
they
look
into
each
other
faces
and
wonder
who
next
we
must
all
die
together
said
sanders
quickly
before
anything
else
must
vetch
marks
the
terror
concealed
in
the
words
and
when
the
dreaded
giant
is
out
of
earshot
says
for
god
sake
let
go
on
alone
alick
you
see
what
sort
of
a
cove
that
gabbett
is
he
kill
his
father
before
he
fast
one
they
made
for
the
bush
but
the
giant
turned
and
strode
towards
them
vetch
skipped
nimbly
on
one
side
but
gabbett
struck
the
moocher
on
the
forehead
with
the
axe
help
jem
help
cried
the
victim
cut
but
not
fatally
and
in
the
strength
of
his
desperation
tore
the
axe
from
the
monster
who
bore
it
and
flung
it
to
vetch
keep
it
jemmy
he
cried
let
have
no
more
murder
done
they
fare
again
through
the
horrible
bush
until
nightfall
when
vetch
in
a
strange
voice
called
the
giant
to
him
he
must
either
you
or
he
laughs
gabbett
give
me
the
no
no
said
the
crow
his
thin
malignant
face
distorted
by
a
horrible
resolution
i
keep
the
axe
stand
back
you
shall
hold
him
and
i
do
the
sanders
seeing
them
approach
knew
his
end
was
come
and
submitted
crying
give
me
half
an
hour
to
pray
for
they
consent
and
the
bewildered
wretch
knelt
down
and
folded
his
hands
like
a
child
his
big
stupid
face
worked
with
emotion
his
great
cracked
lips
moved
in
desperate
agony
he
wagged
his
head
from
side
to
side
in
pitiful
confusion
of
his
brutalized
senses
i
ca
think
o
the
words
jem
pah
snarled
the
cripple
swinging
the
axe
we
ca
starve
here
all
four
days
had
passed
and
the
two
survivors
of
this
awful
journey
sat
watching
each
other
the
gaunt
giant
his
eyes
gleaming
with
hate
and
hunger
sat
sentinel
over
the
dwarf
the
dwarf
chuckling
at
his
superior
sagacity
clutched
the
fatal
axe
for
two
days
they
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
for
two
days
each
had
promised
himself
that
on
the
next
his
companion
must
sleep
and
die
vetch
comprehended
the
devilish
scheme
of
the
monster
who
had
entrapped
five
of
his
to
aid
him
by
their
deaths
to
his
own
safety
and
held
aloof
gabbett
watched
to
snatch
the
weapon
from
his
companion
and
make
the
odds
even
once
and
for
ever
in
the
they
travelled
on
seeking
each
a
pretext
to
creep
behind
the
other
in
the
when
they
feigned
slumber
each
stealthily
raising
a
head
caught
the
wakeful
glance
of
his
companion
vetch
felt
his
strength
deserting
him
and
his
brain
overpowered
by
fatigue
surely
the
giant
muttering
gesticulating
and
slavering
at
the
mouth
was
on
the
road
to
madness
would
the
monster
find
opportunity
to
rush
at
him
and
braving
the
axe
kill
him
by
main
force
or
would
he
sleep
and
be
himself
a
victim
unhappy
vetch
it
is
the
terrible
privilege
of
insanity
to
be
sleepless
on
the
fifth
day
vetch
creeping
behind
a
tree
takes
off
his
belt
and
makes
a
noose
he
will
hang
himself
he
gets
one
end
of
the
belt
over
a
bough
and
then
his
cowardice
bids
him
pause
gabbett
approaches
he
tries
to
evade
him
and
steal
away
into
the
bush
in
vain
the
insatiable
giant
ravenous
with
famine
and
sustained
by
madness
is
not
to
be
shaken
off
vetch
tries
to
run
but
his
legs
bend
under
him
the
axe
that
has
tried
to
drink
so
much
blood
feels
heavy
as
lead
he
will
fling
it
away
no
he
dares
not
night
falls
again
he
must
rest
or
go
mad
his
limbs
are
powerless
his
eyelids
are
glued
together
he
sleeps
as
he
stands
this
horrible
thing
must
be
a
dream
he
is
at
port
arthur
or
will
wake
on
his
pallet
in
the
penny
he
slept
at
when
a
boy
is
that
the
deputy
come
to
wake
him
to
the
torment
of
living
it
is
not
time
surely
not
time
yet
he
sleeps
and
the
giant
grinning
with
ferocious
joy
approaches
on
clumsy
tiptoe
and
seizes
the
coveted
axe
on
the
north
coast
of
van
diemen
land
is
a
place
called
st
point
and
a
certain
skipper
being
in
want
of
fresh
water
landing
there
with
a
boat
crew
found
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
a
gaunt
and
man
clad
in
tattered
yellow
who
carried
on
his
back
an
axe
and
a
bundle
when
the
sailors
came
within
sight
of
him
he
made
signs
to
them
to
approach
and
opening
his
bundle
with
much
ceremony
offered
them
some
of
its
contents
filled
with
horror
at
what
the
maniac
displayed
they
seized
and
bound
him
at
hobart
town
he
was
recognized
as
the
only
survivor
of
the
nine
desperadoes
who
had
escaped
from
colonel
arthur
natural
penitentiary
end
of
book
the
third

chapter
extracted
from
the
diary
of
the
rev
james
north
bathurst
february
in
turning
over
the
pages
of
my
journal
to
note
the
good
fortune
that
has
just
happened
to
me
i
am
struck
by
the
utter
desolation
of
my
life
for
the
last
seven
years
can
it
be
possible
that
i
james
north
the
the
poet
the
prizeman
the
heaven
knows
what
else
have
been
content
to
live
on
at
this
dreary
spot
an
animal
eating
and
drinking
for
tomorrow
i
die
yet
it
has
been
so
my
world
that
world
of
which
i
once
dreamt
so
much
has
been
here
my
fame
which
was
to
reach
the
ends
of
the
earth
has
penetrated
to
the
neighbouring
stations
i
am
considered
a
good
preacher
by
my
friends
it
is
kind
of
them
yet
on
the
eve
of
leaving
it
i
confess
that
this
solitary
life
has
not
been
without
its
charms
i
have
had
my
books
and
my
thoughts
though
at
times
the
latter
were
but
grim
companions
i
have
striven
with
my
familiar
sin
and
have
not
always
been
worsted
melancholy
reflection
not
always
but
yet
is
as
a
gaoler
to
bring
forth
some
monstrous
malefactor
i
vowed
however
that
i
would
not
cheat
myself
in
this
diary
of
mine
and
i
will
not
no
evasions
no
glossings
over
of
my
own
sins
this
journal
is
my
confessor
and
i
bare
my
heart
to
it
it
is
curious
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
setting
down
here
in
black
and
white
these
agonies
and
secret
cravings
of
which
i
dare
not
speak
it
is
for
the
same
reason
i
suppose
that
murderers
make
confession
to
dogs
and
cats
that
people
with
something
on
their
mind
are
given
to
thinking
aloud
that
the
queen
of
midas
must
needs
whisper
to
the
sedges
the
secret
of
her
husband
infirmity
outwardly
i
am
a
man
of
god
pious
and
grave
and
softly
spoken
inwardly
what
the
mean
cowardly
weak
sinner
that
this
book
knows
me
imp
i
could
tear
you
in
pieces
one
of
these
days
i
will
in
the
meantime
i
will
keep
you
under
lock
and
key
and
you
shall
hug
my
secrets
close
no
old
friend
with
whom
i
have
communed
so
long
forgive
me
forgive
me
you
are
to
me
instead
of
wife
or
priest
i
tell
to
your
cold
blue
pages
how
much
was
it
i
bought
you
for
in
parramatta
rascal
these
stories
longings
remorses
which
i
would
fain
tell
to
human
ear
could
i
find
a
human
being
as
discreet
as
thou
it
has
been
said
that
a
man
dare
not
write
all
his
thoughts
and
deeds
the
words
would
blister
the
paper
yet
your
sheets
are
smooth
enough
you
fat
rogue
our
neighbours
of
rome
know
human
nature
a
man
must
confess
one
reads
of
wretches
who
have
carried
secrets
in
their
bosoms
for
years
and
blurted
them
forth
at
last
i
shut
up
here
without
companionship
without
sympathy
without
letters
can
not
lock
up
my
soul
and
feed
on
my
own
thoughts
they
will
out
and
so
i
whisper
them
to
thee
what
art
thou
thou
tremendous
power
who
dost
inhabit
us
without
our
leave
and
art
within
ourselves
another
self
a
master
self
that
loves
to
domineer
what
conscience
that
is
a
word
to
frighten
children
the
conscience
of
each
man
is
of
his
own
making
my
friend
the
cannibal
whom
staples
brought
in
his
whaler
to
sydney
would
have
found
his
conscience
reproach
him
sorely
did
he
refuse
to
partake
of
the
feasts
made
sacred
by
the
customs
of
his
ancestors
a
spark
of
divinity
the
divinity
that
according
to
received
doctrine
sits
apart
enthroned
amid
sweet
music
and
leaves
poor
humanity
to
earn
its
condemnation
as
it
may
i
have
none
of
that
though
i
preach
it
one
must
soothe
the
vulgar
senses
of
the
people
priesthood
has
its
pious
frauds
the
master
spoke
in
parables

the
wit
that
sees
how
are
our
actions
and
our
aspirations
the
devilish
wit
born
of
our
own
brain
that
sneers
at
us
for
our
own
failings
perhaps
madness
more
likely
for
there
are
few
men
who
are
not
mad
one
hour
of
the
waking
twelve
if
differing
from
the
judgment
of
the
majority
of
mankind
in
regard
to
familiar
things
be
madness
i
suppose
i
am
mad
or
too
wise
the
speculation
draws
near
to
james
north
recall
your
early
recklessness
your
ruin
and
your
redemption
bring
your
mind
back
to
earth
circumstances
have
made
you
what
you
are
and
will
shape
your
destiny
for
you
without
your
interference
that
comfortably
settled
now
supposing
to
take
another
canter
on
my
that
man
is
the
slave
of
circumstances
a
doctrine
which
i
am
inclined
to
believe
though
unwilling
to
confess
what
circumstance
can
have
brought
about
the
sudden
awakening
of
the
powers
that
be
to
james
north
fitness
for
duty
hobart
town
dear
north
i
have
much
pleasure
in
informing
you
that
you
can
be
appointed
protestant
chaplain
at
norfolk
island
if
you
like
it
seems
that
they
did
not
get
on
well
with
the
last
man
and
when
my
advice
was
asked
i
at
once
recommended
you
for
the
office
the
pay
is
small
but
you
have
a
house
and
so
on
it
is
certainly
better
than
bathurst
and
indeed
is
considered
rather
a
prize
in
the
clerical
lottery
there
is
to
be
an
investigation
into
affairs
down
there
poor
old
pratt
who
went
down
as
you
know
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
the
government
seems
to
have
become
absurdly
lenient
with
the
prisoners
and
it
is
reported
that
the
island
is
in
a
frightful
state
sir
eardley
is
looking
out
for
some
disciplinarian
to
take
the
place
in
hand
in
the
meantime
the
chaplaincy
is
vacant
and
i
thought
of
i
must
consider
this
seeming
good
fortune
further
february
i
accept
there
is
work
to
be
done
among
those
unhappy
men
that
may
be
my
purgation
the
authorities
shall
hear
me
yet
though
inquiry
was
stifled
at
port
arthur
by
the
way
a
pharaoh
had
arisen
who
knows
not
joseph
it
is
evident
that
the
meddlesome
parson
who
complained
of
men
being
flogged
to
death
is
forgotten
as
the
men
are
how
many
ghosts
must
haunt
the
dismal
loneliness
of
that
prison
shore
poor
burgess
is
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
i
wonder
if
his
spirit
revisits
the
scenes
of
its
violences
i
have
written
poor
burgess
it
is
strange
how
we
pity
a
man
gone
out
of
this
life
enmity
is
extinguished
when
one
can
but
remember
injuries
if
a
man
had
injured
me
the
fact
of
his
living
at
all
would
be
sufficient
grounds
for
me
to
hate
him
if
i
had
injured
him
i
should
hate
him
still
more
is
that
the
reason
i
hate
myself
at
times
my
greatest
enemy
and
one
whom
i
have
injured
beyond
forgiveness
there
are
offences
against
one
own
nature
that
are
not
to
be
forgiven
is
it
tacitus
who
says
the
hatred
of
those
most
nearly
related
is
most
inveterate
but
i
am
taking
flight
again
february

do

accuracy
is
a
virtue
to
exercise
it
then

ninety
miles
from

i
should
say
about

hostess
name
carr
she
is
a
creature
about
years
of
age
and
a
clever
woman
not
in
a
poetical
sense
but
in
the
widest
worldly
acceptation
of
the
term
at
the
same
time
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
her
husband
women
have
no
business
with
a
brain
like
hers
that
is
if
they
wish
to
be
women
and
not
sexual
monsters
carr
is
not
a
lady
though
she
might
have
been
one
i
do
think
she
is
a
good
woman
either
it
is
possible
indeed
that
she
has
known
the
factory
before
now
there
is
a
mystery
about
her
for
i
was
informed
that
she
was
a
purfoy
the
widow
of
a
whaling
captain
and
had
married
one
of
her
assigned
servants
who
had
deserted
her
five
years
ago
as
soon
as
he
obtained
his
freedom
a
word
or
two
at
dinner
set
me
thinking
she
had
received
some
english
papers
and
accounting
for
her
manner
grimly
said
i
think
i
have
news
of
my
i
should
not
like
to
be
in
carr
shoes
if
she
has
news
of
him
i
think
she
would
suffer
indignity
calmly
after
all
what
business
is
it
of
mine
i
was
beguiled
into
taking
more
wine
at
dinner
than
i
needed
confessor
do
you
hear
me
but
i
will
not
allow
myself
to
be
carried
away
you
grin
you
fat
familiar
so
may
i
but
i
shall
be
eaten
with
remorse
tomorrow
march
a
place
called
jerrilang
where
i
have
a
head
and
heartache
one
that
hath
let
go
himself
from
the
hold
and
stay
of
reason
and
lies
open
to
the
mercy
of
all
march
sydney
at
captain
seventeen
days
since
i
have
opened
you
beloved
and
detested
companion
of
mine
i
have
more
than
half
a
mind
to
never
open
you
again
to
read
you
is
to
recall
to
myself
all
i
would
most
willingly
forget
yet
not
to
read
you
would
be
to
forget
all
that
which
i
should
for
my
sins
remember
the
last
week
has
made
a
new
man
of
me
i
am
no
longer
morose
despairing
and
bitter
but
genial
and
on
good
terms
with
fortune
it
is
strange
that
accident
should
have
induced
me
to
stay
a
week
under
the
same
roof
with
that
vision
of
brightness
which
has
haunted
me
so
long
a
meeting
in
the
street
an
introduction
an
invitation
the
thing
is
done
the
circumstances
which
form
our
fortunes
are
certainly
curious
things
i
had
thought
never
again
to
meet
the
bright
young
face
to
which
i
felt
so
strange
an
attraction
and
lo
here
it
is
smiling
on
me
daily
captain
frere
should
be
a
happy
man
yet
there
is
a
skeleton
in
this
house
also
that
young
wife
by
nature
so
lovable
and
so
mirthful
ought
not
to
have
the
sadness
on
her
face
that
twice
has
clouded
it
he
seems
a
passionate
and
boorish
creature
this
wonderful
convict
disciplinarian
his
convicts
poor
devils
are
doubtless
disciplined
enough
charming
little
sylvia
with
your
quaint
wit
and
weird
beauty
he
is
not
good
enough
for
you
and
yet
it
was
a
love
match
march
i
have
read
family
prayers
every
night
since
i
have
been
here
my
black
coat
and
white
tie
gave
me
the
natural
in
such
matters
and
i
feel
guilty
every
time
i
read
i
wonder
what
the
little
lady
of
the
devotional
eyes
would
say
if
she
knew
that
i
am
a
miserable
hypocrite
preaching
that
which
i
do
not
practise
exhorting
others
to
believe
those
marvels
which
i
do
not
believe
i
am
a
coward
not
to
throw
off
the
saintly
mask
and
appear
as
a
freethinker
yet
am
i
a
coward
i
urge
upon
myself
that
it
is
for
the
glory
of
god
i
hold
my
peace
the
scandal
of
a
priest
turned
infidel
would
do
more
harm
than
the
reign
of
reason
would
do
good
imagine
this
trustful
woman
for
instance
she
would
suffer
anguish
at
the
thoughts
of
such
a
sin
though
another
were
the
sinner
if
anyone
offend
one
of
these
little
ones
it
were
better
for
him
that
a
millstone
be
hanged
about
his
neck
and
that
he
be
cast
into
the
yet
truth
is
truth
and
should
be
spoken
should
it
not
malignant
monitor
who
remindest
me
how
often
i
fail
to
speak
it
surely
among
all
his
army
of
our
worthy
bishop
must
have
some
men
like
me
who
can
not
bring
their
reason
to
believe
in
things
contrary
to
the
experience
of
mankind
and
the
laws
of
nature
march
this
unromantic
captain
frere
had
had
some
romantic
incidents
in
his
life
and
he
is
fond
of
dilating
upon
them
it
seems
that
in
early
life
he
expected
to
have
been
left
a
large
fortune
by
an
uncle
who
had
quarrelled
with
his
heir
but
the
uncle
dies
on
the
day
fixed
for
the
altering
of
the
will
the
son
disappears
and
is
thought
to
be
drowned
the
widow
however
steadfastly
refuses
to
believe
in
any
report
of
the
young
man
death
and
having
a
in
the
property
holds
it
against
all
comers
my
poor
host
in
consequence
comes
out
here
on
his
pay
and
three
years
ago
just
as
he
is
hoping
that
the
death
of
his
aunt
may
give
him
opportunity
to
enforce
a
claim
as
next
of
kin
to
some
portion
of
the
property
the
son
returns
is
recognized
by
his
mother
and
the
trustees
and
installed
in
due
heirship
the
other
romantic
story
is
connected
with
frere
marriage
he
told
me
after
dinner
how
his
wife
had
been
wrecked
when
a
child
and
how
he
had
saved
her
life
and
defended
her
from
the
rude
hands
of
an
escaped
convict
one
of
the
monsters
our
monstrous
system
breeds
that
was
how
we
fell
in
love
said
he
tossing
off
his
wine
complacently
an
auspicious
opportunity
said
i
to
which
he
nodded
he
is
not
overburdened
with
brains
i
fancy
let
me
see
if
i
can
set
down
some
account
of
this
lovely
place
and
its
people
a
long
low
white
house
surrounded
by
a
blooming
garden
wide
windows
opening
on
a
lawn
the
ever
glorious
ever
changing
sea
beneath
it
is
evening
i
am
talking
with
frere
of
theories
of
social
reform
of
picture
galleries
of
sunsets
and
new
books
there
comes
a
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
it
is
the
magistrate
returned
from
his
we
hear
him
come
briskly
up
the
steps
but
we
go
on
talking
i
fancy
there
was
a
time
when
the
lady
would
have
run
to
meet
him
he
enters
coldly
kisses
his
wife
and
disturbs
at
once
the
current
of
our
thoughts
it
has
been
hot
what
still
no
letter
from
north
i
saw
golightly
in
town
sylvia
and
she
asked
for
you
there
is
to
be
a
ball
at
government
house
we
must
then
he
departs
and
is
heard
in
the
distance
indistinctly
cursing
because
the
water
is
not
hot
enough
or
because
dawkins
his
convict
servant
has
not
brushed
his
trousers
sufficiently
we
resume
our
chat
but
he
returns
all
hungry
and
bluff
and
dinner
i
ready
for
it
north
take
by
and
by
it
is
north
some
sherry
sylvia
the
soup
is
spoilt
again
did
you
go
out
no
his
eyebrows
contract
here
and
i
know
he
says
inwardly
reading
some
trashy
novel
i
however
he
grins
and
obligingly
relates
how
the
police
have
captured
cockatoo
bill
the
noted
bushranger
after
dinner
the
disciplinarian
and
i
converse
of
dogs
and
horses
gamecocks
convicts
and
moving
accidents
by
flood
and
field
i
remember
old
college
feats
and
strive
to
keep
pace
with
him
in
the
relation
of
athletics
what
hypocrites
we
are
for
all
the
time
i
am
longing
to
get
to
the
and
finish
my
criticism
of
the
new
poet
tennyson
to
frere
frere
does
not
read
tennyson
nor
anybody
else
adjourned
to
the
we
chat
frere
and
i
until
supper
he
eats
supper
she
is
a
charming
companion
and
when
i
talk
my
best
i
can
talk
you
must
admit
o
familiar
her
face
lightens
up
with
an
interest
i
rarely
see
upon
it
at
other
times
i
feel
cooled
and
soothed
by
this
companionship
the
quiet
refinement
of
this
house
after
bullocks
and
bathurst
is
like
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
frere
is
about
she
is
rather
beneath
the
middle
height
with
a
slight
girlish
figure
this
girlish
appearance
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
she
has
bright
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
upon
conversation
with
her
however
one
sees
that
her
face
has
lost
much
of
the
delicate
plumpness
which
it
probably
owned
in
youth
she
has
had
one
child
born
only
to
die
her
cheeks
are
thin
and
her
eyes
have
a
tinge
of
sadness
which
speak
of
physical
pain
or
mental
grief
this
thinness
of
face
makes
the
eyes
appear
larger
and
the
brow
broader
than
they
really
are
her
hands
are
white
and
painfully
thin
they
must
have
been
plump
and
pretty
once
her
lips
are
red
with
perpetual
fever
captain
frere
seems
to
have
absorbed
all
his
wife
vitality
who
quotes
the
story
of
lucius
claudius
hermippus
who
lived
to
a
great
age
by
being
constantly
breathed
on
by
young
girls
i
suppose
burton
who
quotes
everything
in
proportion
as
she
has
lost
her
vigour
and
youth
he
has
gained
strength
and
heartiness
though
he
is
at
least
forty
years
of
age
he
does
not
look
more
than
thirty
his
face
is
ruddy
his
eyes
bright
his
voice
firm
and
ringing
he
must
be
a
man
of
considerable
strength
and
i
should
say
of
more
than
ordinary
animal
courage
and
animal
appetite
there
is
not
a
nerve
in
his
body
which
does
not
twang
like
a
piano
wire
in
appearance
he
is
tall
broad
and
bluff
with
red
whiskers
and
reddish
hair
slightly
touched
with
grey
his
manner
is
loud
coarse
and
imperious
his
talk
of
dogs
horses
and
convicts
what
a
pair
march
a
letter
from
van
diemen
land
there
is
a
row
in
the
pantry
said
frere
with
his
accustomed
slang
it
seems
that
the
of
convicts
has
appointed
a
pounce
to
go
down
and
make
a
report
on
the
state
of
norfolk
island
i
am
to
go
down
with
him
and
shall
receive
instructions
to
that
effect
from
the
i
have
informed
frere
of
this
and
he
has
written
to
pounce
to
come
and
stay
on
his
way
down
there
has
been
nothing
but
convict
discipline
talked
since
frere
is
great
upon
this
point
and
wearies
me
with
his
explanations
of
convict
tricks
and
wickedness
he
is
celebrated
for
his
knowledge
of
such
matters
detestable
wisdom
his
servants
hate
him
but
they
obey
him
without
a
murmur
i
have
observed
that
habitual
criminals
like
all
savage
beasts
cower
before
the
man
who
has
once
mastered
them
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
the
van
diemen
land
government
selected
frere
as
their
disciplinarian
i
hope
they
wo
and
yet
i
hope
they
will
april
nothing
worth
recording
until
eating
drinking
and
sleeping
despite
my
years
i
begin
to
feel
almost
like
the
james
north
who
fought
the
bargee
and
took
the
gold
medal
what
a
drink
water
is
the
fons
bandusiae
splendidior
vitreo
was
better
than
all
the
massic
master
horace
i
doubt
if
your
celebrated
liquor
bottled
when
manlius
was
consul
could
compare
with
it
but
to
my
notable
facts
i
have
found
out
two
things
which
surprise
me
one
is
that
the
convict
who
attempted
the
life
of
frere
is
none
other
than
the
unhappy
man
whom
my
fatal
weakness
caused
to
be
flogged
at
port
arthur
and
whose
face
comes
before
me
to
reproach
me
even
now
the
other
that
carr
is
an
old
acquaintance
of
frere
the
latter
piece
of
information
i
obtained
in
a
curious
way
one
night
while
frere
was
not
there
we
were
talking
of
clever
women
i
broached
my
theory
that
strong
intellect
in
women
went
far
to
destroy
their
womanly
nature
desire
in
man
said
i
should
be
volition
in
women
reason
intuition
reverence
devotion
passion
love
the
woman
should
strike
a
lower
but
a
sharper
sound
man
has
vigour
of
reason
woman
quickness
of
feeling
the
woman
who
possesses
masculine
force
of
intellect
is
he
did
not
half
comprehend
me
i
could
see
but
he
agreed
with
the
broad
view
of
the
case
i
only
knew
one
woman
who
was
really
as
they
call
it
he
said
and
she
was
a
regular
bad
it
does
not
follow
that
she
should
be
bad
said
i
this
one
was
though
stock
lock
and
barrel
but
as
sharp
as
a
needle
sir
and
as
immovable
as
a
rock
a
fine
woman
i
saw
by
the
expression
of
the
man
face
that
he
owned
ugly
memories
and
pressed
him
further
up
country
somewhere
he
said
married
her
assigned
servant
i
was
told
a
fellow
named
carr
i
have
seen
her
for
years
and
do
know
what
she
may
be
like
now
but
in
the
days
when
i
knew
her
she
was
just
what
you
let
it
be
noted
that
i
had
described
nothing
she
came
out
in
the
ship
with
me
as
maid
to
my
wife
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
that
i
had
met
her
but
i
know
what
induced
me
to
be
silent
there
are
passages
in
the
lives
of
men
of
captain
frere
complexion
which
do
bear
descanting
on
i
expect
there
have
been
in
this
case
for
he
changed
the
subject
abruptly
as
his
wife
came
in
is
it
possible
that
these
two
creatures
the
notable
disciplinarian
and
the
wife
of
the
assigned
servant
could
have
been
more
than
friends
in
youth
quite
possible
he
is
the
sort
of
man
for
gross
amours
a
pretty
way
i
am
abusing
my
host
and
the
supple
woman
with
the
dark
eyes
would
have
been
just
the
creature
to
enthral
him
perhaps
some
such
story
as
this
may
account
in
part
for
frere
sad
looks
why
do
i
speculate
on
such
things
i
seem
to
do
violence
to
myself
and
to
insult
her
by
writing
such
suspicions
if
i
was
a
flagellant
now
i
would
don
hairshirt
and
up
flail
for
this
sort
cometh
not
out
but
by
prayer
and
april
mr
pounce
has
arrived
full
of
the
importance
of
his
mission
he
walks
with
the
air
of
a
minister
of
state
on
the
eve
of
a
vacant
garter
hoping
wondering
fearing
and
dignified
even
in
his
dubitancy
i
am
as
flippant
as
a
concerning
this
fatuous
official
and
yet
heaven
knows
i
feel
deeply
enough
the
importance
of
the
task
he
has
before
him
one
relieves
one
brain
by
these
whirlings
of
one
mental
limbs
i
remember
that
a
prisoner
at
hobart
town
twice
condemned
and
twice
reprieved
jumped
and
shouted
with
frenzied
vehemence
when
he
heard
his
sentence
of
death
was
finally
pronounced
he
told
me
if
he
had
not
so
shouted
he
believed
he
would
have
gone
mad
april
we
had
a
state
dinner
last
night
the
conversation
was
about
nothing
in
the
world
but
convicts
i
never
saw
frere
to
less
advantage
silent
distraite
and
sad
she
told
me
after
dinner
that
she
disliked
the
very
name
of
convict
from
early
associations
i
have
lived
among
them
all
my
life
she
said
but
that
does
not
make
it
the
better
for
me
i
have
terrible
fancies
at
times
north
that
seem
i
dread
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
prisoners
again
i
am
sure
that
some
evil
awaits
me
at
their
i
laughed
of
course
but
it
would
not
do
she
holds
to
her
own
opinion
and
looks
at
me
with
horror
in
her
eyes
this
terror
in
her
face
is
perplexing
you
are
nervous
i
said
you
want
i
am
nervous
she
replied
with
that
candour
of
voice
and
manner
i
have
before
remarked
in
her
and
i
have
presentiments
of
we
sat
silent
for
a
while
and
then
she
suddenly
turned
her
large
eyes
on
me
and
said
calmly
mr
north
what
death
shall
i
die
the
question
was
an
echo
of
my
own
thoughts
i
have
some
foolish
fancies
as
to
physiognomy
and
it
made
me
start
what
death
indeed
what
sort
of
death
would
one
meet
with
eyes
parted
lips
and
brows
bent
as
though
to
rally
courage
not
a
peaceful
death
surely
i
brought
my
black
coat
to
my
aid
my
dear
lady
you
must
not
think
of
such
things
death
is
but
a
sleep
you
know
why
anticipate
a
nightmare
she
sighed
slowly
awaking
as
though
from
some
momentary
trance
checking
herself
on
the
verge
of
tears
she
rallied
turned
the
conversation
and
finding
an
excuse
for
going
to
the
piano
dashed
into
a
waltz
this
unnatural
gaiety
ended
i
fancy
in
an
hysterical
fit
i
heard
her
husband
afterwards
recommending
sal
volatile
he
is
the
sort
of
man
who
would
recommend
sal
volatile
to
the
pythoness
if
she
consulted
him
april
all
has
been
arranged
and
we
start
pounce
is
in
a
condition
of
painful
dignity
he
seems
afraid
to
move
lest
motion
should
thaw
his
official
ice
having
found
out
that
i
am
the
chaplain
he
has
refrained
from
familiarity
my
is
wounded
but
my
patience
relieved
query
would
not
the
majority
of
mankind
rather
be
bored
by
people
in
authority
than
not
noticed
by
them
james
north
declines
to
answer
for
his
part
i
have
made
my
farewells
to
my
friends
and
on
looking
back
on
the
pleasant
hours
i
have
spent
felt
saddened
it
is
not
likely
that
i
shall
have
many
such
pleasant
hours
i
feel
like
a
vagabond
who
having
been
allowed
to
sit
by
a
cheerful
fireside
for
a
while
is
turned
out
into
the
wet
and
windy
streets
and
finds
them
colder
than
ever
what
were
the
lines
i
wrote
in
her
album
as
some
poor
drenched
in
wine
with
staggering
footsteps
through
the
streets
returning
seeing
through
blinding
rain
a
beacon
shine
from
household
lamp
in
happy
window
burning
pauses
an
instant
at
the
reddened
pane
to
gaze
on
that
sweet
scene
of
love
and
duty
then
turns
into
the
wild
wet
night
again
lest
his
sad
presence
mar
its
homely
yes
those
were
the
lines
with
more
of
truth
in
them
than
she
expected
and
yet
what
business
have
i
sentimentalizing
my
socius
thinks
what
a
puling
fool
this
north
is
so
that
over
now
for
norfolk
island
and
my
purgation
chapter
ii
the
lost
heir
the
lost
son
of
sir
richard
devine
had
returned
to
england
and
made
claim
to
his
name
and
fortune
in
other
words
john
rex
had
successfully
carried
out
the
scheme
by
which
he
had
usurped
the
rights
of
his
old
smoking
his
cigar
in
his
bachelor
lodgings
or
pausing
in
a
calculation
concerning
a
race
john
rex
often
wondered
at
the
strange
ease
with
which
he
had
carried
out
so
monstrous
and
seemingly
difficult
an
imposture
after
he
was
landed
in
sydney
by
the
vessel
which
sarah
purfoy
had
sent
to
save
him
he
found
himself
a
slave
to
a
bondage
scarcely
less
galling
than
that
from
which
he
had
escaped
the
bondage
of
enforced
companionship
with
an
unloved
woman
the
opportune
death
of
one
of
her
assigned
servants
enabled
sarah
purfoy
to
instal
the
escaped
convict
in
his
room
in
the
strange
state
of
society
which
prevailed
of
necessity
in
new
south
wales
at
that
period
it
was
not
unusual
for
assigned
servants
to
marry
among
the
free
settlers
and
when
it
was
heard
that
purfoy
the
widow
of
a
whaling
captain
had
married
john
carr
her
storekeeper
transported
for
embezzlement
and
with
two
years
of
his
sentence
yet
to
run
no
one
expressed
surprise
indeed
when
the
year
after
john
carr
blossomed
into
an
expiree
master
of
a
fine
wife
and
a
fine
fortune
there
were
many
about
him
who
would
have
made
his
existence
in
australia
pleasant
enough
but
john
rex
had
no
notion
of
remaining
longer
than
he
could
help
and
ceaselessly
sought
means
of
escape
from
this
second
for
a
long
time
his
search
was
unsuccessful
much
as
she
loved
the
scoundrel
sarah
purfoy
did
not
scruple
to
tell
him
that
she
had
bought
him
and
regarded
him
as
her
property
he
knew
that
if
he
made
any
attempt
to
escape
from
his
the
woman
who
had
risked
so
much
to
save
him
would
not
hesitate
to
deliver
him
over
to
the
authorities
and
state
how
the
opportune
death
of
john
carr
had
enabled
her
to
give
name
and
employment
to
john
rex
the
absconder
he
had
thought
once
that
the
fact
of
her
being
his
wife
would
prevent
her
from
giving
evidence
against
him
and
that
he
could
thus
defy
her
but
she
reminded
him
that
a
word
to
blunt
would
be
all
sufficient
i
know
you
do
care
for
me
now
john
she
said
with
grim
complacency
but
your
life
is
in
my
hands
and
if
you
desert
me
i
will
bring
you
to
the
in
vain
in
his
secret
eagerness
to
be
rid
of
her
he
raged
and
chafed
he
was
tied
hand
and
foot
she
held
his
money
and
her
shrewd
wit
had
more
than
doubled
it
she
was
and
he
could
but
wait
until
her
death
or
some
lucky
accident
should
rid
him
of
her
and
leave
him
free
to
follow
out
the
scheme
he
had
matured
once
rid
of
her
he
thought
in
his
solitary
rides
over
the
station
of
which
he
was
the
nominal
owner
the
rest
is
easy
i
shall
return
to
england
with
a
plausible
story
of
shipwreck
and
shall
doubtless
be
received
with
open
arms
by
the
dear
mother
from
whom
i
have
been
so
long
parted
richard
devine
shall
have
his
own
to
be
rid
of
her
was
not
so
easy
twice
he
tried
to
escape
from
his
thraldom
and
was
twice
brought
back
i
have
bought
you
john
his
partner
had
laughed
and
you
do
get
away
from
me
surely
you
can
be
content
with
these
comforts
you
were
content
with
less
once
i
am
not
so
ugly
and
repulsive
am
i
i
am
john
carr
retorted
let
us
go
to
england
she
tapped
her
strong
white
fingers
sharply
on
the
table
go
to
england
no
no
that
is
what
you
would
like
to
do
you
would
be
master
there
you
would
take
my
money
and
leave
me
to
starve
i
know
you
jack
we
stop
here
dear
here
where
i
can
hand
you
over
to
the
first
trooper
as
an
escaped
convict
if
you
are
not
kind
to
oh
i
do
mind
your
abuse
abuse
me
if
you
like
jack
beat
me
if
you
will
but
do
leave
me
or
it
will
be
worse
for
you
are
a
strange
woman
he
cried
in
sudden
petulant
admiration
to
love
such
a
villain
i
do
know
that
i
love
you
because
you
are
a
villain
a
better
man
would
be
wearisome
to
such
as
i
i
wish
to
heaven
i
never
left
port
arthur
better
there
than
this
dog
go
back
then
you
have
only
to
say
the
word
and
so
they
would
wrangle
she
glorying
in
her
power
over
the
man
who
had
so
long
triumphed
over
her
and
he
consoling
himself
with
the
hope
that
the
day
was
not
far
distant
which
should
bring
him
at
once
freedom
and
fortune
one
day
the
chance
came
to
him
his
wife
was
ill
and
the
ungrateful
scoundrel
stole
five
hundred
pounds
and
taking
two
horses
reached
sydney
and
obtained
passage
in
a
vessel
bound
for
rio
having
escaped
thraldom
john
rex
proceeded
to
play
for
the
great
stake
of
his
life
with
the
utmost
caution
he
went
to
the
continent
and
lived
for
weeks
together
in
the
towns
where
richard
devine
might
possibly
have
resided
familiarizing
himself
with
streets
making
the
acquaintance
of
old
inhabitants
drawing
into
his
own
hands
all
loose
ends
of
information
which
could
help
to
knit
the
meshes
of
his
net
the
closer
such
loose
ends
were
not
numerous
the
prodigal
had
been
too
poor
too
insignificant
to
leave
strong
memories
behind
him
yet
rex
knew
well
by
what
strange
accidents
the
deceit
of
an
assumed
identity
is
often
penetrated
some
old
comrade
or
companion
of
the
lost
heir
might
suddenly
appear
with
keen
questions
as
to
trifles
which
could
cut
his
flimsy
web
to
shreds
as
easily
as
the
sword
of
saladin
divided
the
floating
silk
he
could
not
afford
to
ignore
the
most
insignificant
circumstances
with
consummate
skill
piece
by
piece
he
built
up
the
story
which
was
to
deceive
the
poor
mother
and
to
make
him
possessor
of
one
of
the
largest
private
fortunes
in
england
this
was
the
tale
he
hit
upon
he
had
been
saved
from
the
burning
hydaspes
by
a
vessel
bound
for
rio
ignorant
of
the
death
of
sir
richard
and
prompted
by
the
pride
which
was
known
to
be
a
leading
feature
of
his
character
he
had
determined
not
to
return
until
fortune
should
have
bestowed
upon
him
wealth
at
least
equal
to
the
inheritance
from
which
he
had
been
ousted
in
spanish
america
he
had
striven
to
accumulate
that
wealth
in
vain
as
vequero
traveller
speculator
sailor
he
had
toiled
for
fourteen
years
and
had
failed
worn
out
and
penitent
he
had
returned
home
to
find
a
corner
of
english
earth
in
which
to
lay
his
weary
bones
the
tale
was
plausible
enough
and
in
the
telling
of
it
he
was
armed
at
all
points
there
was
little
fear
that
the
navigator
of
the
captured
osprey
the
man
who
had
lived
in
chile
and
cut
out
cattle
on
the
carrum
plains
would
prove
lacking
in
knowledge
of
riding
seamanship
or
spanish
customs
moreover
he
had
determined
upon
a
course
of
action
which
showed
his
knowledge
of
human
nature
the
will
under
which
richard
devine
inherited
was
dated
in
and
had
been
made
when
the
testator
was
in
the
first
hopeful
glow
of
paternity
by
its
terms
lady
devine
was
to
receive
a
life
interest
of
three
thousand
a
year
in
her
husband
property
which
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
two
trustees
until
her
eldest
son
died
or
attained
the
age
of
years
when
either
of
these
events
should
occur
the
property
was
to
be
realized
lady
devine
receiving
a
sum
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
which
invested
in
consols
for
her
benefit
would
according
to
sir
richard
prudent
calculation
exactly
compensate
for
her
loss
of
interest
the
remainder
going
absolutely
to
the
son
if
living
to
his
children
or
next
of
kin
if
dead
the
trustees
appointed
were
lady
devine
father
colonel
wotton
wade
and
silas
quaid
of
the
firm
of
purkiss
and
quaid
thavies
inn
sir
richard
solicitors
colonel
wade
before
his
death
had
appointed
his
son
francis
wade
to
act
in
his
stead
when
quaid
died
the
firm
of
purkiss
and
quaid
represented
in
the
quaid
branch
of
it
by
a
smart
nephew
declined
further
responsibility
and
with
the
consent
of
lady
devine
francis
wade
continued
alone
in
his
trust
sir
richard
sister
and
her
husband
anthony
frere
of
bristol
were
long
ago
dead
and
as
we
know
their
representative
maurice
frere
content
at
last
in
the
lot
that
fortune
had
sent
him
had
given
up
all
thought
of
meddling
with
his
uncle
business
john
rex
therefore
in
the
person
of
the
returned
richard
had
but
two
persons
to
satisfy
his
putative
uncle
francis
wade
and
his
putative
mother
lady
devine
this
he
found
to
be
the
easiest
task
possible
francis
wade
was
an
invalid
virtuoso
who
detested
business
and
whose
ambition
was
to
be
known
as
man
of
taste
the
possessor
of
a
small
independent
income
he
had
resided
at
north
end
ever
since
his
father
death
and
had
made
the
place
a
miniature
strawberry
hill
when
at
his
sister
urgent
wish
he
assumed
the
sole
responsibility
of
the
estate
he
put
all
the
floating
capital
into
per
and
was
content
to
see
the
interest
accumulate
lady
devine
had
never
recovered
the
shock
of
the
circumstances
attending
sir
richard
death
and
clinging
to
the
belief
in
her
son
existence
regarded
herself
as
the
mere
guardian
of
his
interests
to
be
displaced
at
any
moment
by
his
sudden
return
the
retired
pair
lived
thus
together
and
spent
in
charity
and
about
a
fourth
of
their
mutual
income
by
both
of
them
the
return
of
the
wanderer
was
hailed
with
delight
to
lady
devine
it
meant
the
realization
of
a
lifelong
hope
become
part
of
her
nature
to
francis
wade
it
meant
relief
from
a
responsibility
which
his
simplicity
always
secretly
loathed
the
responsibility
of
looking
after
another
money
i
shall
not
think
of
interfering
with
the
arrangements
which
you
have
made
my
dear
uncle
said
john
rex
on
the
first
night
of
his
reception
it
would
be
most
ungrateful
of
me
to
do
so
my
wants
are
very
few
and
can
easily
be
supplied
i
will
see
your
lawyers
some
day
and
settle
see
them
at
once
richard
see
them
at
once
i
am
no
man
of
business
you
know
but
i
think
you
will
find
all
richard
however
put
off
the
visit
from
day
to
day
he
desired
to
have
as
little
to
do
with
lawyers
as
possible
he
had
resolved
upon
his
course
of
action
he
would
get
money
from
his
mother
for
immediate
needs
and
when
that
mother
died
he
would
assert
his
rights
my
rough
life
has
unfitted
me
for
dear
mother
he
said
do
not
let
there
be
a
display
about
my
return
give
me
a
corner
to
smoke
my
pipe
and
i
am
lady
devine
with
a
loving
tender
pity
for
which
john
rex
could
not
altogether
account
consented
and
mr
richard
soon
came
to
be
regarded
as
a
martyr
to
circumstances
a
man
conscious
of
his
own
imperfections
and
one
whose
imperfections
were
therefore
lightly
dwelt
upon
so
the
returned
prodigal
had
his
own
suite
of
rooms
his
own
servants
his
own
bank
account
drank
smoked
and
was
merry
for
five
or
six
months
he
thought
himself
in
paradise
then
he
began
to
find
his
life
insufferably
weary
the
burden
of
hypocrisy
is
very
heavy
to
bear
and
rex
was
compelled
perpetually
to
bear
it
his
mother
demanded
all
his
time
she
hung
upon
his
lips
she
made
him
repeat
fifty
times
the
story
of
his
wanderings
she
was
never
tired
of
kissing
him
of
weeping
over
him
and
of
thanking
him
for
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
for
her
we
promised
never
to
speak
of
it
more
richard
the
poor
lady
said
one
day
but
if
my
lifelong
love
can
make
atonement
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
you
hush
dearest
mother
said
john
rex
who
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
what
it
was
all
about
let
us
say
no
lady
devine
wept
quietly
for
a
while
and
then
went
away
leaving
the
man
who
pretended
to
be
her
son
much
bewildered
and
a
little
frightened
there
was
a
secret
which
he
had
not
fathomed
between
lady
devine
and
her
son
the
mother
did
not
again
refer
to
it
and
gaining
courage
as
the
days
went
on
rex
grew
bold
enough
to
forget
his
fears
in
the
first
stages
of
his
deception
he
had
been
timid
and
cautious
then
the
soothing
influence
of
comfort
respect
and
security
came
upon
him
and
almost
refined
him
he
began
to
feel
as
he
had
felt
when
lionel
crofton
was
alive
the
sensation
of
being
ministered
to
by
a
loving
woman
who
kissed
him
night
and
morning
calling
him
son
of
being
regarded
with
admiration
by
rustics
with
envy
by
respectable
folk
of
being
deferred
to
in
all
things
was
novel
and
pleasing
they
were
so
good
to
him
that
he
felt
at
times
inclined
to
confess
all
and
leave
his
case
in
the
hands
of
the
folk
he
had
injured
yet
he
thought
such
a
course
would
be
absurd
it
would
result
in
no
benefit
to
anyone
simply
in
misery
to
himself
the
true
richard
devine
was
buried
fathoms
deep
in
the
greedy
ocean
of
and
the
waves
of
innumerable
punishments
washed
over
him
john
rex
flattered
himself
that
he
had
usurped
the
name
of
one
who
was
in
fact
no
living
man
and
that
unless
one
should
rise
from
the
dead
richard
devine
could
never
return
to
accuse
him
so
flattering
himself
he
gradually
became
bolder
and
by
slow
degrees
suffered
his
true
nature
to
appear
he
was
violent
to
the
servants
cruel
to
dogs
and
horses
often
wantonly
coarse
in
speech
and
brutally
regardless
of
the
feelings
of
others
governed
like
most
women
solely
by
her
feelings
lady
devine
had
at
first
been
prodigal
of
her
affection
to
the
man
she
believed
to
be
her
injured
son
but
his
rash
acts
of
selfishness
his
habits
of
grossness
and
gradually
disgusted
her
for
some
time
she
poor
woman
fought
against
this
feeling
endeavouring
to
overcome
her
instincts
of
distaste
and
arguing
with
herself
that
to
permit
a
detestation
of
her
unfortunate
son
to
arise
in
her
heart
was
almost
criminal
but
she
was
at
length
forced
to
succumb
for
the
first
year
richard
conducted
himself
with
great
propriety
but
as
his
circle
of
acquaintance
and
his
confidence
in
himself
increased
he
now
and
then
forgot
the
part
he
was
playing
one
day
richard
went
to
pass
the
day
with
a
sporting
friend
only
too
proud
to
see
at
his
table
so
wealthy
and
wonderful
a
man
richard
drank
a
good
deal
more
than
was
good
for
him
and
returned
home
in
a
condition
of
disgusting
drunkenness
i
say
disgusting
because
some
folks
have
the
art
of
getting
drunk
after
a
humorous
fashion
that
robs
intoxication
of
half
its
grossness
for
john
rex
to
be
drunk
was
to
be
himself
coarse
and
cruel
francis
wade
was
away
and
lady
devine
had
retired
for
the
night
when
the
brought
home
mr
richard
the
virtuous
who
opened
the
door
received
a
blow
in
the
chest
and
a
demand
for
brandy
the
groom
was
cursed
and
ordered
to
instant
oblivion
richard
stumbled
into
the
veiled
in
dim
light
as
a
which
was
sitting
up
for
its
master
ought
to
be
and
ordered
more
candles
the
candles
were
brought
after
some
delay
and
richard
amused
himself
by
spilling
their
meltings
upon
the
carpet
let
have
he
cried
and
climbing
with
muddy
boots
upon
the
costly
chairs
scraping
with
his
feet
the
polished
table
attempted
to
fix
the
wax
in
the
silver
sconces
with
which
the
antiquarian
tastes
of
francis
wade
had
adorned
the
room
you

the
servant
damn

rex

tomkins
aghast

the
upper
regions

cried
john

plunging
to
the
door
tomkins
attempting
to
restrain
him

instantly
hurled
into
a
cabinet
of
rare
china
and
the
drunken
brute

the
stairs

other

him

curses
and
fights

horrified
asking

and
begging
for

put
out
the
whole
house
is
in
an
uproar
in
the
midst
of
which
lady
devine
appears
and
looks
down
upon
the
scene
rex
catches
sight
of
her
and
bursts
into
blasphemy
she
withdraws
strangely
terrified
and
the
animal
torn
bloody
and
blasphemous
is
at
last
got
into
his
own
apartments
the
groom
whose
face
had
been
seriously
damaged
in
the
encounter
bestowing
a
hearty
kick
on
the
prostrate
carcase
at
parting
the
next
morning
lady
devine
declined
to
see
her
son
though
he
sent
a
special
apology
to
her
i
am
afraid
i
was
a
little
overcome
by
wine
last
night
said
he
to
tomkins
well
you
was
sir
said
tomkins
a
very
little
wine
makes
me
quite
ill
tomkins
did
i
do
anything
very
violent
you
was
rather
obstropolous
here
a
sovereign
for
you
tomkins
did
i
say
anything
you
cussed
a
good
deal
richard
most
gents
do
when
bin
hum
dining
out
what
a
fool
i
am
thought
john
rex
as
he
dressed
i
shall
spoil
everything
if
i
do
take
he
was
right
he
was
going
the
right
way
to
spoil
everything
however
for
this
bout
he
made
amends
money
soothed
the
servants
hall
and
apologies
and
time
won
lady
forgiveness
i
can
not
yet
conform
to
english
habits
my
dear
mother
said
rex
and
feel
at
times
out
of
place
in
your
quiet
home
i
think
that
if
you
can
spare
me
a
little
money
i
should
like
to
lady
devine
with
a
sense
of
relief
for
which
she
blamed
herself
assented
and
supplied
with
letters
of
credit
john
rex
went
to
paris
fairly
started
in
the
world
of
dissipation
and
excess
he
began
to
grow
reckless
when
a
young
man
he
had
been
singularly
free
from
the
vice
of
drunkenness
turning
his
sobriety
as
he
did
all
his
virtues
to
vicious
account
but
he
had
learnt
to
drink
deep
in
the
loneliness
of
the
bush
master
of
a
large
sum
of
money
he
had
intended
to
spend
it
as
he
would
have
spent
it
in
his
younger
days
he
had
forgotten
that
since
his
death
and
burial
the
world
had
not
grown
younger
it
was
possible
that
lionel
crofton
might
have
discovered
some
of
the
old
set
of
fools
and
knaves
with
whom
he
had
once
mixed
many
of
them
were
alive
and
flourishing
lemoine
for
instance
was
respectably
married
in
his
native
island
of
jersey
and
had
already
threatened
to
disinherit
a
nephew
who
showed
a
tendency
to
dissipation
but
lemoine
would
not
care
to
recognize
lionel
crofton
the
gambler
and
rake
in
his
proper
person
and
it
was
not
expedient
that
his
acquaintance
should
be
made
in
the
person
of
richard
devine
lest
by
some
unlucky
chance
he
should
recognize
the
cheat
thus
poor
lionel
crofton
was
compelled
to
lie
still
in
his
grave
and
richard
devine
trusting
to
a
big
beard
and
more
burly
figure
to
keep
his
secret
was
compelled
to
begin
his
friendship
with
lionel
whilom
friends
all
over
again
in
paris
and
london
there
were
plenty
of
people
ready
to
become
with
any
gentleman
possessing
money
richard
devine
history
was
whispered
in
many
a
boudoir
and
the
history
however
was
not
always
told
in
the
same
way
it
was
generally
known
that
lady
devine
had
a
son
who
being
supposed
to
be
dead
had
suddenly
returned
to
the
confusion
of
his
family
but
the
manner
of
his
return
was
told
in
many
ways
in
the
first
place
francis
wade
though
he
was
did
not
move
in
that
brilliant
circle
which
had
lately
received
his
nephew
there
are
in
england
many
men
of
fortune
as
large
as
that
left
by
the
old
who
are
positively
unknown
in
that
little
world
which
is
supposed
to
contain
all
the
men
worth
knowing
francis
wade
was
a
man
of
mark
in
his
own
coterie
among
artists
sellers
antiquarians
and
men
of
letters
he
was
known
as
a
patron
and
man
of
taste
his
bankers
and
his
lawyers
knew
him
to
be
of
independent
fortune
but
as
he
neither
mixed
in
politics
went
into
society
betted
or
speculated
in
merchandise
there
were
several
large
sections
of
the
community
who
had
never
heard
his
name
many
respectable
would
have
required
further
information
before
they
would
discount
his
bills
and
clubmen
in
general
save
perhaps
those
ancient
quidnuncs
who
know
everybody
from
adam
downwards
had
but
little
acquaintance
with
him
the
advent
of
richard
devine
a
coarse
person
of
unlimited
means
had
therefore
chief
influence
upon
that
sinister
circle
of
male
and
female
rogues
who
form
the
they
began
to
inquire
concerning
his
antecedents
and
failing
satisfactory
information
to
invent
lies
concerning
him
it
was
generally
believed
that
he
was
a
black
sheep
a
man
whose
family
kept
him
out
of
the
way
but
who
was
in
a
pecuniary
sense
good
for
a
considerable
sum
thus
taken
upon
trust
richard
devine
mixed
in
the
very
best
of
bad
society
and
had
no
lack
of
agreeable
friends
to
help
him
to
spend
money
so
admirably
did
he
spend
it
that
francis
wade
became
at
last
alarmed
at
the
frequent
drafts
and
urged
his
nephew
to
bring
his
affairs
to
a
final
settlement
richard
devine
in
paris
hamburg
or
london
or
elsewhere
could
never
be
got
to
attack
business
and
francis
wade
grew
more
and
more
anxious
the
poor
gentleman
positively
became
ill
through
the
anxiety
consequent
upon
his
dissipations
i
wish
my
dear
richard
that
you
would
let
me
know
what
to
do
he
wrote
i
wish
my
dear
uncle
that
you
would
do
what
you
think
best
was
his
nephew
reply
will
you
let
purkiss
and
quaid
look
into
the
business
said
the
badgered
francis
i
hate
lawyers
said
richard
do
what
you
think
wade
began
to
repent
of
his
too
easy
taking
of
matters
in
the
beginning
not
that
he
had
a
suspicion
of
rex
but
that
he
had
remembered
that
dick
was
always
a
loose
fish
the
even
current
of
the
dilettante
life
became
disturbed
he
grew
pale
and
his
digestion
was
impaired
he
ceased
to
take
the
interest
in
china
which
the
importance
of
that
article
demanded
in
a
word
he
grew
despondent
as
to
his
fitness
for
his
mission
in
life
lady
ellinor
saw
a
change
in
her
brother
he
became
morose
peevish
excitable
she
went
privately
to
the
family
doctor
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
there
is
no
danger
said
he
if
he
is
kept
quiet
keep
him
quiet
and
he
will
live
for
years
but
his
father
died
of
heart
disease
you
lady
ellinor
upon
this
wrote
a
long
letter
to
richard
who
was
at
paris
repeated
the
doctor
opinions
and
begged
him
to
come
over
at
once
richard
replied
that
some
matter
of
great
importance
occupied
his
attention
but
that
he
would
be
at
his
rooms
in
clarges
street
he
had
long
ago
established
a
town
house
on
the
and
would
go
into
matters
i
have
lost
a
good
deal
of
money
lately
my
dear
mother
said
richard
and
the
present
will
be
a
good
opportunity
to
make
a
final
the
fact
was
that
john
rex
now
three
years
in
undisturbed
possession
considered
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
the
execution
of
his
grand
coup
the
carrying
off
at
one
swoop
of
the
whole
of
the
fortune
he
had
gambled
for
chapter
iii
extracted
from
the
diary
of
the
rev
james
north
may
landed
at
norfolk
island
and
have
been
introduced
to
my
new
abode
situated
some
eleven
hundred
miles
from
sydney
a
solitary
rock
in
the
tropical
ocean
the
island
seems
indeed
a
fit
place
of
banishment
it
is
about
seven
miles
long
and
four
broad
the
most
remarkable
natural
object
is
of
course
the
norfolk
island
pine
which
rears
its
stately
head
a
hundred
feet
above
the
surrounding
forest
the
appearance
of
the
place
is
very
wild
and
beautiful
bringing
to
my
mind
the
description
of
the
romantic
islands
of
the
pacific
which
old
geographers
dwell
upon
so
fondly
lemon
lime
and
guava
trees
abound
also
oranges
grapes
figs
bananas
peaches
pomegranates
and
the
climate
just
now
is
hot
and
muggy
the
approach
to
kingstown
as
the
barracks
and
huts
are
called
is
properly
difficult
a
long
low
reef
probably
originally
a
portion
of
the
barren
rocks
of
nepean
and
philip
islands
which
rise
east
and
west
of
the
settlement
fronts
the
bay
and
obstructs
the
entrance
of
vessels
we
were
landed
in
boats
through
an
opening
in
this
reef
and
our
vessel
stands
on
and
off
within
signalling
distance
the
surf
washes
almost
against
the
walls
of
the
military
roadway
that
leads
to
the
barracks
the
social
aspect
of
the
place
fills
me
with
horror
there
seems
neither
discipline
nor
order
on
our
way
to
the
commandant
house
we
passed
a
low
dilapidated
building
where
men
were
grinding
maize
and
at
the
sight
of
us
they
commenced
whistling
hooting
and
shouting
using
the
most
disgusting
language
three
warders
were
near
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
check
this
unseemly
exhibition
may
i
sit
down
to
write
with
as
much
reluctance
as
though
i
were
about
to
relate
my
experience
of
a
journey
through
a
sewer
first
to
the
prisoners
barracks
which
stand
on
an
area
of
about
three
acres
surrounded
by
a
lofty
wall
a
road
runs
between
this
wall
and
the
sea
the
barracks
are
three
storeys
high
and
hold
seven
hundred
and
ninety
men
let
me
remark
here
that
there
are
more
than
two
thousand
men
on
the
island
there
are
wards
in
this
place
each
ward
runs
the
depth
of
the
building
eighteen
feet
and
in
consequence
is
simply
a
funnel
for
hot
or
cold
air
to
blow
through
when
the
ward
is
filled
the
men
heads
lie
under
the
windows
the
largest
ward
contains
a
hundred
men
the
smallest
fifteen
they
sleep
in
hammocks
slung
close
to
each
other
as
on
board
ship
in
two
lines
with
a
passage
down
the
centre
there
is
a
wardsman
to
each
ward
he
is
selected
by
the
prisoners
and
is
generally
a
man
of
the
worst
character
he
is
supposed
to
keep
order
but
of
course
he
never
attempts
to
do
so
indeed
as
he
is
locked
up
in
the
ward
every
night
from
six
in
the
evening
until
sunrise
without
light
it
is
possible
that
he
might
get
maltreated
did
he
make
himself
obnoxious
the
barracks
look
upon
the
barrack
square
which
is
filled
with
lounging
prisoners
the
windows
of
the
also
look
upon
barrack
square
and
the
prisoners
are
in
constant
communication
with
the
patients
the
hospital
is
a
low
stone
building
capable
of
containing
about
twenty
men
and
faces
the
beach
i
placed
my
hands
on
the
wall
and
found
it
damp
an
ulcerous
prisoner
said
the
dampness
was
owing
to
the
heavy
surf
constantly
rolling
so
close
beneath
the
building
there
are
two
gaols
the
old
and
the
new
the
old
gaol
stands
near
the
sea
close
to
the
outside
it
at
the
door
is
the
gallows
i
touched
it
as
i
passed
in
this
engine
is
the
first
thing
which
greets
the
eyes
of
a
prisoner
the
new
gaol
is
barely
completed
is
of
pentagonal
shape
and
has
eighteen
radiating
cells
of
a
pattern
approved
by
some
wiseacre
in
england
who
thinks
that
to
prevent
a
man
from
seeing
his
fellowmen
is
not
the
way
to
drive
him
mad
in
the
old
gaol
are
prisoners
all
heavily
ironed
awaiting
trial
by
the
visiting
commission
from
hobart
town
some
of
these
poor
ruffians
having
committed
their
offences
just
after
the
last
sitting
of
the
commission
have
already
been
in
gaol
upwards
of
eleven
months
at
six
we
saw
the
men
mustered
i
read
prayers
before
the
muster
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
some
of
the
prisoners
attended
while
some
strolled
about
the
yard
whistling
singing
and
joking
the
muster
is
a
farce
the
prisoners
are
not
mustered
outside
and
then
marched
to
their
wards
but
they
rush
into
the
barracks
indiscriminately
and
place
themselves
dressed
or
undressed
in
their
hammocks
a
convict
then
calls
out
the
names
and
somebody
replies
if
an
answer
is
returned
to
each
name
all
is
considered
right
the
lights
are
taken
away
and
save
for
a
few
minutes
at
eight
when
the
men
are
let
in
the
ruffians
are
left
to
their
own
devices
until
morning
knowing
what
i
know
of
the
customs
of
the
convicts
my
heart
sickens
when
i
in
imagination
put
myself
in
the
place
of
a
man
plunged
from
six
at
night
until
daybreak
into
that
foetid
den
of
worse
than
wild
beasts
may
there
is
a
place
enclosed
between
high
walls
adjoining
the
convict
barracks
called
the
lumber
yard
this
is
where
the
prisoners
mess
it
is
roofed
on
two
sides
and
contains
tables
and
benches
six
hundred
men
can
mess
here
perhaps
but
as
seven
hundred
are
always
driven
into
it
it
follows
that
the
weakest
men
are
compelled
to
sit
on
the
ground
a
more
disorderly
sight
than
this
yard
at
meal
times
i
never
beheld
the
are
adjoining
it
and
the
men
bake
their
there
outside
the
door
the
firewood
is
piled
and
fires
are
made
in
all
directions
on
the
ground
round
which
sit
the
prisoners
frying
their
rations
of
fresh
pork
baking
their
hominy
cakes
chatting
and
even
smoking
the
lumber
yard
is
a
sort
of
alsatia
to
which
the
hunted
prisoner
retires
i
do
think
the
boldest
constable
on
the
island
would
venture
into
that
place
to
pick
out
a
man
from
the
seven
hundred
if
he
did
go
in
i
do
think
he
would
come
out
again
alive
may
a
a
man
named
hankey
has
been
talking
to
me
he
says
that
there
are
some
forty
of
the
oldest
and
worst
prisoners
who
form
what
he
calls
the
ring
and
that
the
members
of
this
ring
are
bound
by
oath
to
support
each
other
and
to
avenge
the
punishment
of
any
of
their
number
in
proof
of
his
assertions
he
instanced
two
cases
of
english
prisoners
who
had
refused
to
join
in
some
crime
and
had
informed
the
commandant
of
the
proceedings
of
the
ring
they
were
found
in
the
morning
strangled
in
their
hammocks
an
inquiry
was
held
but
not
a
man
out
of
the
ninety
in
the
ward
would
speak
a
word
i
dread
the
task
that
is
before
me
how
can
i
attempt
to
preach
piety
and
morality
to
these
men
how
can
i
attempt
even
to
save
the
less
villainous
may
visited
the
wards
and
returned
in
despair
the
condition
of
things
is
worse
than
i
expected
it
is
not
to
be
written
the
english
prisoners
and
some
of
their
histories
are
most
touching
are
insulted
by
the
language
and
demeanour
of
the
hardened
miscreants
who
are
the
refuse
of
port
arthur
and
cockatoo
island
the
vilest
crimes
are
perpetrated
as
jests
these
are
creatures
who
openly
defy
authority
whose
language
and
conduct
is
such
as
was
never
before
seen
or
heard
out
of
bedlam
there
are
men
who
are
known
to
have
murdered
their
companions
and
who
boast
of
it
with
these
the
english
farm
labourer
the
riotous
and
ignorant
mechanic
the
victim
of
perjury
or
mistake
are
indiscriminately
herded
with
them
are
mixed
chinamen
from
hong
kong
the
aborigines
of
new
holland
west
indian
blacks
greeks
caffres
and
malays
soldiers
for
desertion
idiots
madmen
and
the
dreadful
place
seems
set
apart
for
all
that
is
hideous
and
vile
in
our
common
nature
in
its
recklessness
its
insubordination
its
filth
and
its
despair
it
realizes
to
my
mind
the
popular
notion
of
hell
may
entered
officially
upon
my
duties
as
religious
instructor
at
the
settlement
an
occurrence
took
place
this
morning
which
shows
the
dangerous
condition
of
the
ring
i
accompanied
pounce
to
the
lumber
yard
and
on
our
entry
we
observed
a
man
in
the
crowd
round
the
deliberately
smoking
the
chief
constable
of
the
island
my
old
friend
troke
of
port
arthur
seeing
that
this
exhibition
attracted
notice
pointed
out
the
man
to
an
assistant
the
assistant
jacob
gimblett
advanced
and
desired
the
prisoner
to
surrender
the
pipe
the
man
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
with
a
gesture
of
the
most
profound
contempt
walked
away
to
that
part
of
the
where
the
ring
congregate
take
the
scoundrel
to
gaol
cried
troke
no
one
moved
but
the
man
at
the
gate
that
leads
through
the
shop
into
the
barracks
called
to
us
to
come
out
saying
that
the
prisoners
would
never
suffer
the
man
to
be
taken
pounce
however
with
more
determination
than
i
gave
him
credit
for
kept
his
ground
and
insisted
that
so
flagrant
a
breach
of
discipline
should
not
be
suffered
to
pass
unnoticed
thus
urged
troke
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
made
for
the
spot
whither
the
man
had
withdrawn
himself
the
yard
was
buzzing
like
a
disturbed
hive
and
i
momentarily
expected
that
a
rush
would
be
made
upon
us
in
a
few
moments
the
prisoner
appeared
attended
by
rather
than
in
the
custody
of
the
chief
constable
of
the
island
he
advanced
to
the
unlucky
assistant
constable
who
was
standing
close
to
me
and
asked
what
have
you
ordered
me
to
gaol
for
the
man
made
some
reply
advising
him
to
go
quietly
when
the
convict
raised
his
fist
and
deliberately
felled
the
man
to
the
ground
you
had
better
retire
gentlemen
said
troke
i
see
them
getting
out
their
we
made
for
the
gate
and
the
crowd
closed
in
like
a
sea
upon
the
two
constables
i
fully
expected
murder
but
in
a
few
moments
troke
and
gimblett
appeared
borne
along
by
a
mass
of
men
dusty
but
unharmed
and
having
the
convict
between
them
he
sulkily
raised
a
hand
as
he
passed
me
either
to
rectify
the
position
of
his
straw
hat
or
to
offer
a
tardy
apology
a
more
wanton
unprovoked
and
flagrant
outrage
than
that
of
which
this
man
was
guilty
i
never
witnessed
it
is
customary
for
the
old
dogs
as
the
experienced
convicts
are
called
to
use
the
most
opprobrious
language
to
their
officers
and
to
this
a
deaf
ear
is
usually
turned
but
i
never
before
saw
a
man
wantonly
strike
a
constable
i
fancy
that
the
act
was
done
out
of
bravado
troke
informed
me
that
the
man
name
is
rufus
dawes
and
that
he
is
the
leader
of
the
ring
and
considered
the
worst
man
on
the
island
that
to
secure
him
he
troke
was
obliged
to
use
the
language
of
expostulation
and
that
but
for
the
presence
of
an
officer
accredited
by
his
excellency
he
dared
not
have
acted
as
he
had
done
this
is
the
same
man
then
whom
i
injured
at
port
arthur
seven
years
of
discipline
do
seem
to
have
done
him
much
good
his
sentence
is
life
a
lifetime
in
this
place
troke
says
that
he
was
the
terror
of
port
arthur
and
that
they
sent
him
here
when
a
weeding
of
the
prisoners
was
made
he
has
been
here
four
years
poor
wretch
may
after
prayers
i
saw
dawes
he
was
confined
in
the
old
gaol
and
seven
others
were
in
the
cell
with
him
he
came
out
at
my
request
and
stood
leaning
against
the
he
was
much
changed
from
the
man
i
remember
seven
years
ago
he
was
a
stalwart
upright
handsome
man
he
has
become
a
sullen
slouching
ruffian
his
hair
is
grey
though
he
can
not
be
more
than
forty
years
of
age
and
his
frame
has
lost
that
just
proportion
of
parts
which
once
made
him
almost
graceful
his
face
has
also
grown
like
other
convict
faces
how
hideously
alike
they
all
are
and
save
for
his
black
eyes
and
a
peculiar
trick
he
had
of
compressing
his
lips
i
should
not
have
recognized
him
how
habitual
sin
and
misery
suffice
to
brutalize
the
human
face
divine
i
said
but
little
for
the
other
prisoners
were
listening
eager
as
it
appeared
to
me
to
witness
my
discomfiture
it
is
evident
that
rufus
dawes
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
the
ministrations
of
my
predecessors
with
insolence
i
spoke
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
only
saying
how
foolish
it
was
to
rebel
against
an
authority
superior
in
strength
to
himself
he
did
not
answer
and
the
only
emotion
he
evinced
during
the
interview
was
when
i
reminded
him
that
we
had
met
before
he
shrugged
one
shoulder
as
if
in
pain
or
anger
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
group
in
the
cell
relapsed
into
silence
again
i
must
get
speech
with
him
alone
one
can
do
nothing
with
a
man
if
seven
other
devils
worse
than
himself
are
locked
up
with
him
i
sent
for
hankey
and
asked
him
about
cells
he
says
that
the
gaol
is
crowded
to
suffocation
solitary
confinement
is
a
mere
name
there
are
six
men
each
sentenced
to
solitary
confinement
in
a
cell
together
the
cell
is
called
the
nunnery
it
is
small
and
the
six
men
were
naked
to
the
waist
when
i
entered
the
perspiration
pouring
in
streams
off
their
naked
bodies
it
is
disgusting
to
write
of
such
things
june
pounce
has
departed
in
the
lady
franklin
for
hobart
town
and
it
is
rumoured
that
we
are
to
have
a
new
commandant
the
lady
franklin
is
commanded
by
an
old
man
named
blunt
a
protegé
of
frere
and
a
fellow
to
whom
i
have
taken
one
of
my
inexplicable
and
unreasoning
dislikes
saw
rufus
dawes
this
morning
he
continues
sullen
and
morose
his
papers
are
very
bad
he
is
perpetually
up
for
punishment
i
am
informed
that
he
and
a
man
named
eastwood
nicknamed
jacky
jacky
glory
in
being
the
leaders
of
the
ring
and
that
they
openly
avow
themselves
weary
of
life
can
it
be
that
the
unmerited
flogging
which
the
poor
creature
got
at
port
arthur
has
aided
with
other
sufferings
to
bring
him
to
this
horrible
state
of
mind
it
is
quite
possible
oh
james
north
remember
your
own
crime
and
pray
heaven
to
let
you
redeem
one
soul
at
least
to
plead
for
your
own
at
the
judgment
seat
june
i
took
a
holiday
this
afternoon
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
mount
pitt
the
island
lay
at
my
feet
like
as
sings
favourite
poet
a
summer
isle
of
eden
lying
in
dark
purple
sphere
of
sea
sophocles
has
the
same
idea
in
the
philoctetes
but
i
quote
it
note
i
measured
a
pine
feet
in
circumference
i
followed
a
little
brook
that
runs
from
the
hills
and
winds
through
thick
undergrowths
of
creeper
and
blossom
until
it
reaches
a
lovely
valley
surrounded
by
lofty
trees
whose
branches
linked
together
by
the
luxurious
form
an
arching
bower
of
verdure
here
stands
the
ruin
of
an
old
hut
formerly
inhabited
by
the
early
settlers
lemons
figs
and
guavas
are
thick
while
amid
the
shrub
and
cane
a
large
convolvulus
is
entwined
and
stars
the
green
with
its
purple
and
crimson
flowers
i
sat
down
here
and
had
a
smoke
it
seems
that
the
former
occupant
of
my
rooms
at
the
settlement
read
french
for
in
searching
for
a
book
to
bring
with
me
i
never
walk
without
a
book
i
found
and
pocketed
a
volume
of
balzac
it
proved
to
be
a
portion
of
the
vie
priveé
series
and
i
stumbled
upon
a
story
called
la
fausse
maitresse
with
calm
belief
in
the
paris
of
his
imagination
where
marcas
was
a
politician
nucingen
a
banker
gobseck
a
and
vautrin
a
candidate
for
some
such
place
as
this
balzac
introduces
me
to
a
pole
by
name
paz
who
loving
the
wife
of
his
friend
devotes
himself
to
watch
over
her
happiness
and
her
husband
interest
the
husband
gambles
and
is
profligate
paz
informs
the
wife
that
the
leanness
which
hazard
and
debauchery
have
caused
to
the
domestic
exchequer
is
due
to
his
extravagance
the
husband
having
lent
him
money
she
does
not
believe
and
paz
feigns
an
intrigue
with
a
in
order
to
lull
all
suspicions
she
says
to
her
adored
spouse
get
rid
of
this
extravagant
friend
away
with
him
he
is

a

paz
finally
departs
and
when
he
has
gone
the
lady
finds
out
the
poor
pole
worth
the
story
does
not
end
satisfactorily
balzac
was
too
great
a
master
of
his
art
for
that
in
real
life
the
curtain
never
falls
on
a
drama
the
play
goes
on
eternally
i
have
been
thinking
of
the
story
all
evening
a
man
who
loves
his
friend
wife
and
devotes
his
energies
to
increase
her
happiness
by
concealing
from
her
her
husband
follies
surely
none
but
balzac
would
have
hit
upon
such
a
notion
a
man
who
loves
his
asmodeus
i
write
no
more
i
have
ceased
to
converse
with
thee
for
so
long
that
i
blush
to
confess
all
that
i
have
in
my
i
will
not
confess
it
so
that
shall
suffice
chapter
iv
extracted
from
the
diary
of
the
rev
james
north
august
there
has
been
but
one
entry
in
my
journal
since
the
june
that
which
records
the
advent
of
our
new
commandant
who
as
i
expected
is
captain
maurice
frere
so
great
have
been
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
that
i
scarcely
know
how
to
record
them
captain
frere
has
realized
my
worst
anticipations
he
is
brutal
vindictive
and
domineering
his
knowledge
of
prisons
and
prisoners
gives
him
an
advantage
over
burgess
otherwise
he
much
resembles
that
murderous
animal
he
has
but
one
thought
to
keep
the
prisoners
in
subjection
so
long
as
the
island
is
quiet
he
cares
not
whether
the
men
live
or
die
i
was
sent
down
here
to
keep
order
said
he
to
me
a
few
days
after
his
arrival
and
by
god
sir
i
do
it
he
has
done
it
i
must
admit
but
at
a
cost
of
a
legacy
of
hatred
to
himself
that
he
may
some
day
regret
to
have
earned
he
has
organized
three
parties
of
police
one
patrols
the
fields
one
is
on
guard
at
stores
and
public
buildings
and
the
third
is
employed
as
a
detective
force
there
are
two
hundred
soldiers
on
the
island
and
the
officer
in
charge
captain
mcnab
has
been
induced
by
frere
to
increase
their
duties
in
many
ways
the
cords
of
discipline
are
suddenly
drawn
tight
for
the
disorder
which
prevailed
when
i
landed
frere
has
substituted
a
sudden
and
excessive
rigour
any
officer
found
giving
the
smallest
piece
of
tobacco
to
a
prisoner
is
liable
to
removal
from
the
tobacco
which
grows
wild
has
been
rooted
up
and
destroyed
lest
the
men
should
obtain
a
leaf
of
it
the
privilege
of
having
a
pannikin
of
hot
water
when
the
gangs
came
in
from
field
labour
in
the
evening
has
been
withdrawn
the
shepherds
and
all
other
prisoners
whether
at
the
stations
of
longridge
or
the
cascades
where
the
english
convicts
are
stationed
are
forbidden
to
keep
a
parrot
or
any
other
bird
the
plaiting
of
straw
hats
during
the
prisoners
leisure
hours
is
also
prohibited
at
the
settlement
where
the
old
hands
are
located
railed
boundaries
have
been
erected
beyond
which
no
prisoner
must
pass
unless
to
work
two
days
ago
job
dodd
a
negro
let
his
jacket
fall
over
the
boundary
rails
crossed
them
to
recover
it
and
was
severely
flogged
the
floggings
are
hideously
frequent
on
flogging
mornings
i
have
seen
the
ground
where
the
men
stood
at
the
triangles
saturated
with
blood
as
if
a
bucket
of
blood
had
been
spilled
on
it
covering
a
space
three
feet
in
diameter
and
running
out
in
various
directions
in
little
streams
two
or
three
feet
long
at
the
same
time
let
me
say
with
that
strict
justice
i
force
myself
to
mete
out
to
those
whom
i
dislike
that
the
island
is
in
a
condition
of
abject
submission
there
is
not
much
chance
of
mutiny
the
men
go
to
their
work
without
a
murmur
and
slink
to
their
dormitories
like
whipped
hounds
to
kennel
the
gaols
and
solitary
cells
are
crowded
with
prisoners
and
each
day
sees
fresh
sentences
for
fresh
crimes
it
is
crime
here
to
do
anything
but
live
the
method
by
which
captain
frere
has
brought
about
this
repose
of
desolation
is
characteristic
of
him
he
sets
every
man
as
a
spy
upon
his
neighbour
awes
the
more
daring
into
obedience
by
the
display
of
a
ruffianism
more
outrageous
than
their
own
and
raising
the
worst
scoundrels
in
the
place
to
office
compels
them
to
find
cases
for
punishment
perfidy
is
rewarded
it
has
been
made
part
of
a
duty
to
search
a
anywhere
and
at
any
time
this
searching
is
often
conducted
in
a
wantonly
rough
and
disgusting
manner
and
if
resistance
be
offered
the
man
resisting
can
be
knocked
down
by
a
blow
from
the
searcher
bludgeon
inquisitorial
vigilance
and
indiscriminating
harshness
prevail
everywhere
and
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
prisoners
are
reduced
to
a
continual
agony
of
terror
and
it
is
impossible
captain
frere
said
i
one
day
during
the
initiation
of
this
system
to
think
that
these
villains
whom
you
have
made
constables
will
do
their
he
replied
they
must
do
their
duty
if
they
are
indulgent
to
the
prisoners
they
know
i
shall
flog
if
they
do
what
i
tell
they
make
themselves
so
hated
that
they
have
their
own
father
up
to
the
triangles
to
save
themselves
being
sent
back
to
the
you
treat
them
then
like
of
a
wild
beast
den
they
must
flog
the
animals
to
avoid
being
flogged
ay
said
he
with
his
coarse
laugh
and
having
once
flogged
they
do
anything
rather
than
be
put
in
the
cage
do
you
see
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
this
sort
of
logic
being
used
by
a
man
who
has
a
wife
and
friends
and
enemies
it
is
the
logic
that
the
keeper
of
the
tormented
would
use
i
should
think
i
am
sick
unto
death
of
the
place
it
makes
me
an
unbeliever
in
the
social
charities
it
takes
out
of
penal
science
anything
it
may
possess
of
nobility
or
worth
it
is
cruel
debasing
inhuman
august
saw
rufus
dawes
again
his
usual
bearing
is
ostentatiously
rough
and
brutal
he
has
sunk
to
a
depth
of
in
which
he
takes
a
delight
in
his
degradation
this
condition
is
one
familiar
to
me
he
is
working
in
the
to
which
hankey
was
made
blind
mooney
an
ophthalmic
prisoner
who
was
removed
from
the
gang
to
hospital
told
me
that
there
was
a
plot
to
murder
hankey
but
that
dawes
to
whom
he
had
shown
some
kindness
had
prevented
it
i
saw
hankey
and
told
him
of
this
asking
him
if
he
had
been
aware
of
the
plot
he
said
no
falling
into
a
great
tremble
major
pratt
promised
me
a
removal
said
he
i
expected
it
would
come
to
i
asked
him
why
dawes
defended
him
and
after
some
trouble
he
told
me
exacting
from
me
a
promise
that
i
would
not
acquaint
the
commandant
it
seems
that
one
morning
last
week
hankey
had
gone
up
to
captain
frere
house
with
a
return
from
troke
and
coming
back
through
the
garden
had
plucked
a
flower
dawes
had
asked
him
for
this
flower
offering
two
days
rations
for
it
hankey
who
is
not
a
man
gave
him
the
sprig
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
took
it
said
he
there
must
be
some
way
to
get
at
this
man
heart
bad
as
he
seems
to
be
august
hankey
was
murdered
yesterday
he
applied
to
be
removed
from
the
but
frere
refused
i
never
let
my
men
he
said
if
they
threatened
to
murder
you
i
keep
you
there
another
month
in
spite
of
someone
who
overheard
this
reported
it
to
the
gang
and
they
set
upon
the
unfortunate
gaoler
yesterday
and
beat
his
brains
out
with
their
shovels
troke
says
that
the
wretch
who
was
foremost
cried
there
for
you
and
if
your
master
do
take
care
he
get
served
the
same
one
of
these
days
the
gang
were
employed
at
building
a
reef
in
the
sea
and
were
working
up
to
their
armpits
in
water
hankey
fell
into
the
surf
and
never
moved
after
the
first
blow
i
saw
the
gang
and
dawes
said
it
was
frere
fault
he
should
have
let
the
man
go
i
am
surprised
you
did
not
interfere
said
i
i
did
all
i
could
was
the
man
answer
what
a
life
more
or
less
here
this
occurrence
has
spread
consternation
among
the
overseers
and
they
have
addressed
a
round
robin
to
the
commandant
praying
to
be
relieved
from
their
positions
the
way
frere
has
dealt
with
this
petition
is
characteristic
of
him
and
fills
me
at
once
with
admiration
and
disgust
he
came
down
with
it
in
his
hand
to
the
walked
into
the
yard
shut
the
gate
and
said
i
just
got
this
from
my
overseers
they
say
they
afraid
you
murder
them
as
you
murdered
hankey
now
if
you
want
to
murder
murder
me
here
i
am
step
out
one
of
all
this
said
in
a
tone
of
the
most
galling
contempt
did
not
move
them
i
saw
a
dozen
pairs
of
eyes
flash
hatred
but
the
courage
of
the
man
overawed
them
here
as
i
am
told
it
had
done
in
sydney
it
would
have
been
easy
to
kill
him
then
and
there
and
his
death
i
am
told
is
sworn
among
them
but
no
one
raised
a
finger
the
only
man
who
moved
was
rufus
dawes
and
he
checked
himself
instantly
frere
with
a
recklessness
of
which
i
did
not
think
him
capable
stepped
up
to
this
terror
of
the
prison
and
ran
his
hands
lightly
down
his
sides
as
is
the
custom
with
constables
when
searching
a
man
dawes
who
is
of
a
fierce
temper
turned
crimson
at
this
and
i
thought
would
have
struck
him
but
he
did
not
frere
then
still
unarmed
and
alone
proceeded
to
the
man
saying
do
you
think
of
bolting
again
dawes
have
you
made
any
more
boats
you
devil
said
the
chained
man
in
a
voice
pregnant
with
such
weight
of
unborn
murder
that
the
gang
winced
you
find
me
one
said
frere
with
a
laugh
and
turning
to
me
continued
in
the
same
jesting
tone
there
a
penitent
for
you
north
try
your
hand
on
i
was
speechless
at
his
audacity
and
must
have
shown
my
disgust
in
my
face
for
he
coloured
slightly
and
as
we
were
leaving
the
yard
he
endeavoured
to
excuse
himself
by
saying
that
it
was
no
use
preaching
to
stones
and
such
villains
as
this
dawes
were
past
hope
i
know
the
ruffian
of
old
said
he
he
came
out
in
the
ship
from
england
with
me
and
tried
to
raise
a
mutiny
on
board
he
was
the
man
who
nearly
murdered
my
wife
he
has
never
been
out
of
irons
except
then
and
when
he
escaped
for
the
last
eighteen
years
and
as
he
three
life
sentences
he
like
to
die
in
a
monstrous
wretch
and
criminal
evidently
and
yet
i
feel
a
strange
sympathy
with
this
outcast
chapter
richard
devine
surprised
the
town
house
of
richard
devine
was
in
clarges
street
not
that
the
very
modest
mansion
there
situated
was
the
only
establishment
of
which
richard
devine
was
master
john
rex
had
expensive
tastes
he
neither
shot
nor
hunted
so
he
had
no
capital
invested
in
scotch
moors
or
leicestershire
but
his
stables
were
the
wonder
of
london
he
owned
almost
a
racing
village
near
doncaster
kept
a
yacht
at
cowes
and
in
addition
to
a
house
in
paris
paid
the
rent
of
a
villa
at
brompton
he
belonged
to
several
clubs
of
the
faster
sort
and
might
have
lived
like
a
prince
at
any
one
of
them
had
he
been
so
minded
but
a
constant
and
haunting
fear
of
discovery
which
three
years
of
unquestioned
ease
and
unbridled
riot
had
not
dispelled
led
him
to
prefer
the
privacy
of
his
own
house
where
he
could
choose
his
own
society
the
house
in
clarges
street
was
decorated
in
conformity
with
the
tastes
of
its
owner
the
pictures
were
pictures
of
horses
the
books
were
records
of
races
or
novels
purporting
to
describe
sporting
life
francis
wade
waiting
on
the
morning
of
the
april
for
the
coming
of
his
nephew
sighed
as
he
thought
of
the
cultured
quiet
of
north
end
house
richard
appeared
in
his
three
years
of
good
living
and
hard
drinking
had
deprived
his
figure
of
its
athletic
beauty
he
was
past
forty
years
of
age
and
the
sudden
cessation
from
severe
bodily
toil
to
which
in
his
active
life
as
a
convict
and
squatter
he
had
been
accustomed
had
increased
rex
natural
proneness
to
fat
and
instead
of
being
portly
he
had
become
gross
his
cheeks
were
inflamed
with
the
frequent
application
of
hot
and
rebellious
liquors
to
his
blood
his
hands
were
swollen
and
not
so
steady
as
of
yore
his
whiskers
were
streaked
with
unhealthy
grey
his
eyes
bright
and
black
as
ever
lurked
in
a
thicket
of
crow
feet
he
had
become
prematurely
bald
a
sure
sign
of
mental
or
bodily
excess
he
spoke
with
assumed
heartiness
in
a
boisterous
tone
of
affected
ease
ha
ha
my
dear
uncle
sit
down
delighted
to
see
you
have
you
breakfasted
of
course
you
have
i
was
up
rather
late
last
night
quite
sure
you
wo
have
anything
a
glass
of
wine
no
then
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
the
news
of
thank
you
richard
said
the
old
gentleman
a
little
stiffly
but
i
want
some
serious
talk
with
you
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
the
property
this
indecision
worries
me
either
relieve
me
of
my
trust
or
be
guided
by
my
well
the
fact
is
said
richard
with
a
very
ugly
look
on
his
face
the
fact
is
and
you
may
as
well
know
it
at
once
i
am
much
pushed
for
pushed
for
money
cried
wade
in
horror
why
purkiss
said
the
property
was
worth
twenty
thousand
a
so
it
might
have
been
five
years
ago
but
my
and
betting
and
other
amusements
concerning
which
you
need
not
too
curiously
inquire
have
reduced
its
value
he
spoke
recklessly
and
roughly
it
was
evident
that
success
had
but
developed
his
ruffianism
his
dandyism
was
only
comparative
the
impulse
of
poverty
and
scheming
which
led
him
to
affect
the
gentleman
having
been
removed
the
natural
brutality
of
his
nature
showed
itself
quite
freely
francis
wade
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
a
sharp
motion
of
distaste
i
do
not
want
to
hear
of
your
debaucheries
he
said
our
name
has
been
sufficiently
disgraced
in
my
what
is
got
over
the
devil
back
goes
under
his
belly
replied
richard
coarsely
my
old
father
got
his
money
by
dirtier
ways
than
these
in
which
i
spend
it
as
villainous
an
old
scoundrel
and
skinflint
as
ever
poisoned
a
seaman
i
go
francis
rose
you
need
not
revile
your
father
richard
he
left
you
ay
but
by
pure
accident
he
did
mean
it
if
he
had
died
in
the
nick
of
time
that
unhung
murderous
villain
maurice
frere
would
have
come
in
for
it
by
the
way
he
added
with
a
change
of
tone
do
you
ever
hear
anything
of
maurice
i
have
not
heard
for
some
years
said
wade
he
is
something
in
the
convict
department
at
sydney
i
is
he
said
richard
with
a
shiver
hope
he
stop
there
well
but
about
business
the
fact
is
that
that
i
am
thinking
of
selling
selling
everything
yes
my
soul
i
am
the
hampstead
place
and
sell
north
end
house
cried
poor
wade
in
bewilderment
sell
it
why
the
carvings
by
grinling
gibbons
are
the
finest
in
i
ca
help
that
laughed
richard
ringing
the
bell
i
want
cash
and
cash
i
must
breakfast
i
going
to
francis
wade
was
breathless
with
astonishment
educated
and
reared
as
he
had
been
he
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
proposing
to
sell
cathedral
as
to
sell
the
casket
which
held
his
treasures
of
art
his
coins
his
his
pictures
and
his
proofs

richard
walked
hurriedly
up
and
down
the
chamber
wiped
his
forehead
drank
a
tumbler
of
brandy
and
finally
sat
down
and
the

was

terribly
to

the
blow
was
unexpected
and
severe
it
was
hard
in
the
very
high
tide
and
flush
of
assured
success
to
be
thus
plucked
back
into
the
old
bondage
despite
the
affectionate
tone
of
the
letter
he
knew
the
woman
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
for
some
furious
minutes
he
sat
motionless
gazing
at
the
letter
he
did
not
speak
men
seldom
do
under
such
circumstances
but
his
thoughts
ran
in
this
fashion
here
is
this
cursed
woman
again
just
as
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
freedom
how
did
she
discover

the

how

dare
say

three
hundred
thousand

not
bad
for

the

in
which
the
chaplain
is
taken
ill
though
the
house
of
the
commandant
of
norfolk
island
was
comfortable
and
well
furnished
and
though
of
necessity
all
that
was
most
hideous
in
the
discipline
of
the
place
was
hidden
the
loathing
with
which
sylvia
had
approached
the
last
and
most
dreaded
abiding
place
of
the
elaborate
convict
system
under
which
it
had
been
her
misfortune
to
live
had
not
decreased
the
sights
and
sounds
of
pain
and
punishment
surrounded
her
she
could
not
look
out
of
her
windows
without
a
shudder
she
dreaded
each
evening
when
her
husband
returned
lest
he
should
blurt
out
some
new
atrocity
she
feared
to
ask
him
in
the
morning
whither
he
was
going
lest
he
should
thrill
her
with
the
announcement
of
some
fresh
punishment
i
wish
maurice
we
had
never
come
here
said
she
piteously
when
he
recounted
to
her
the
scene
of
the
these
unhappy
men
will
do
you
some
frightful
injury
one
of
these
stuff
said
her
husband
they
not
the
courage
i
take
the
best
man
among
them
and
dare
him
to
touch
i
can
not
think
how
you
like
to
witness
so
much
misery
and
villainy
it
is
horrible

for
she
interrupted
him
maurice
i
wish
you
would
not
use
such
language
you
know
i
dislike
she
spoke
coldly
and
sadly
as
one
who
knows
that
remonstrance
is
vain
and
is
yet
constrained
to
remonstrate
oh
dear
my
lady
proper
ca
bear
to
hear
her
husband
swear
how
refined
we
getting
there
i
did
not
mean
to
annoy
you
said
she
wearily
do
let
us
quarrel
for
goodness
he
went
away
noisily
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
carpet
wearily
a
noise
roused
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
north
her
face
beamed
instantly
ah
north
i
did
not
expect
you
what
brings
you
here
you
stay
to
dinner
of
she
rang
the
bell
without
waiting
for
a
reply
mr
north
dines
here
place
a
chair
for
him
and
have
you
brought
me
the
book
i
have
been
looking
for
here
it
is
said
north
producing
a
volume
of
cristo
she
seized
the
book
with
avidity
and
after
running
her
eyes
over
the
pages
turned
inquiringly
to
the
it
belongs
to
my
predecessor
said
north
as
though
in
answer
to
her
thought
he
seems
to
have
been
a
great
reader
of
french
i
have
found
many
french
novels
of
i
thought
clergymen
never
read
french
novels
said
sylvia
with
a
smile
there
are
french
novels
and
french
novels
said
north
stupid
people
confound
the
good
with
the
bad
i
remember
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
in
sydney
who
soundly
abused
me
for
reading
and
when
i
asked
him
if
he
had
read
it
he
said
that
he
would
sooner
cut
his
hand
off
than
open
it
admirable
judge
of
its
merits
but
is
this
really
good
papa
told
me
it
was
it
is
a
romance
but
in
my
opinion
a
very
fine
one
the
notion
of
the
sailor
being
taught
in
prison
by
the
priest
and
sent
back
into
the
world
an
accomplished
gentleman
to
work
out
his
vengeance
is
no
now
you
are
telling
me
laughed
she
and
then
with
feminine
perversity
go
on
what
is
the
story
only
that
of
an
unjustly
imprisoned
man
who
escaping
by
a
marvel
and
becoming
rich
as
johnson
says
the
dreams
of
avarice
devotes
his
life
and
fortune
to
revenge
and
does
he
he
does
upon
all
his
enemies
save
and
he
she
was
the
wife
of
his
greatest
enemy
and
dantès
spared
her
because
he
loved
sylvia
turned
away
her
head
it
seems
interesting
enough
said
she
coldly
there
was
an
awkward
silence
for
a
moment
which
each
seemed
afraid
to
break
north
bit
his
lips
as
though
regretting
what
he
had
said
frere
beat
her
foot
on
the
floor
and
at
length
raising
her
eyes
and
meeting
those
of
the
clergyman
fixed
upon
her
face
rose
hurriedly
and
went
to
meet
her
returning
husband
come
to
dinner
of
course
said
frere
who
though
he
disliked
the
clergyman
yet
was
glad
of
anybody
who
would
help
him
to
pass
a
cheerful
evening
i
came
to
bring
frere
a
ah
she
reads
too
many
books
she
always
reading
books
it
is
not
a
good
thing
to
be
always
poring
over
print
is
it
north
you
have
some
influence
with
her
tell
her
so
come
i
am
he
spoke
with
that
affectation
of
jollity
with
which
husbands
of
his
calibre
veil
their
bad
temper
sylvia
had
her
defensive
armour
on
in
a
twinkling
of
course
you
two
men
will
be
against
me
when
did
two
men
ever
disagree
upon
the
subject
of
wifely
duties
however
i
shall
read
in
spite
of
you
do
you
know
north
that
when
i
married
i
made
a
special
agreement
with
captain
frere
that
i
was
not
to
be
asked
to
sew
on
buttons
for
him
indeed
said
north
not
understanding
this
change
of
humour
and
she
never
has
from
that
hour
said
frere
recovering
his
suavity
at
the
sight
of
food
i
never
have
a
shirt
fit
to
put
on
upon
my
word
there
are
a
dozen
in
the
drawer
north
perused
his
plate
uncomfortably
a
saying
of
omniscient
balzac
occurred
to
him
le
grand
écueil
est
le
ridicule
and
his
mind
began
to
sound
all
sorts
of
philosophical
depths
not
of
the
most
clerical
character
after
dinner
maurice
launched
out
into
his
usual
topic
convict
discipline
it
was
pleasant
for
him
to
get
a
listener
for
his
wife
cold
and
unsympathetic
tacitly
declined
to
enter
into
his
schemes
for
the
subduing
of
the
refractory
villains
you
insisted
on
coming
here
she
would
say
i
did
not
wish
to
come
i
do
like
to
talk
of
these
things
let
us
talk
of
something
when
she
adopted
this
method
of
procedure
he
had
no
alternative
but
to
submit
for
he
was
afraid
of
her
after
a
fashion
in
this
match
he
was
only
apparently
the
master
he
was
a
physical
tyrant
for
him
a
creature
had
but
to
be
weak
to
be
an
object
of
contempt
and
his
gross
nature
triumphed
over
the
finer
one
of
his
wife
love
had
long
since
died
out
of
their
life
the
young
impulsive
delicate
girl
who
had
given
herself
to
him
seven
years
before
had
been
changed
into
a
weary
suffering
woman
the
wife
is
what
her
husband
makes
her
and
his
rude
animalism
had
made
her
the
nervous
invalid
she
was
instead
of
love
he
had
awakened
in
her
a
distaste
which
at
times
amounted
to
disgust
we
have
neither
the
skill
nor
the
boldness
of
that
profound
philosopher
whose
autopsy
of
the
human
heart
awoke
north
contemplation
and
we
will
not
presume
to
set
forth
in
bare
english
the
story
of
this
marriage
of
the
minotaur
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
sylvia
liked
her
husband
least
when
he
loved
her
most
in
this
repulsion
lay
her
power
over
him
when
the
animal
and
spiritual
natures
cross
each
other
the
nobler
triumphs
in
fact
if
not
in
appearance
maurice
frere
though
his
wife
obeyed
him
knew
that
he
was
inferior
to
her
and
was
afraid
of
the
statue
he
had
created
she
was
ice
but
it
was
the
artificial
ice
that
chemists
make
in
the
midst
of
a
furnace
her
coldness
was
at
once
her
strength
and
her
weakness
when
she
chilled
him
she
commanded
him
unwitting
of
the
thoughts
that
possessed
his
guest
frere
chatted
amicably
north
said
little
but
drank
a
good
deal
the
wine
however
rendered
him
silent
instead
of
talkative
he
drank
that
he
might
forget
unpleasant
memories
and
drank
without
accomplishing
his
object
when
the
pair
proceeded
to
the
room
where
frere
awaited
them
frere
was
boisterously
north
silently
misanthropic
sing
something
sylvia
said
frere
with
the
ease
of
possession
as
one
who
should
say
to
a
living
play
oh
north
does
care
for
music
and
i
not
inclined
to
sing
singing
seems
out
of
place
nonsense
said
frere
why
should
it
be
more
out
of
place
here
than
anywhere
else
mrs
frere
means
that
mirth
is
in
a
manner
unsuited
to
these
melancholy
surroundings
said
north
out
of
his
keener
sense
melancholy
surroundings
cried
frere
staring
in
turn
at
the
piano
the
ottomans
and
the
well
the
house
is
as
good
as
the
one
in
sydney
but
it
comfortable
you
do
understand
me
maurice
said
sylvia
this
place
is
very
gloomy
to
me
the
thought
of
the
unhappy
men
who
are
ironed
and
chained
all
about
us
makes
me
what
stuff
said
frere
now
thoroughly
roused
the
ruffians
deserve
all
they
get
and
more
why
should
you
make
yourself
wretched
about
them
poor
men
how
do
we
know
the
strength
of
their
temptation
the
bitterness
of
their
repentance
earn
their
punishment
says
north
in
a
hard
voice
and
taking
up
a
book
suddenly
they
must
learn
to
bear
it
no
repentance
can
undo
their
but
surely
there
is
mercy
for
the
worst
of
urged
sylvia
gently
north
seemed
disinclined
or
unable
to
reply
and
nodded
only
mercy
cried
frere
i
am
not
here
to
be
merciful
i
am
here
to
keep
these
scoundrels
in
order
and
by
the
lord
that
made
me
i
do
it
maurice
do
not
talk
like
that
think
how
slight
an
accident
might
have
made
any
one
of
us
like
one
of
these
men
what
is
the
matter
north
north
has
suddenly
turned
pale
nothing
returned
the
clergyman
gasping
a
sudden
faintness
the
windows
were
thrown
open
and
the
chaplain
gradually
recovered
as
he
did
in
burgess
parlour
at
port
arthur
seven
years
ago
i
am
liable
to
these
attacks
a
touch
of
heart
disease
i
think
i
shall
have
to
rest
for
a
day
or
ah
take
a
spell

frere
you

north
sitting
gasping
and
pale
smiles
in
a
ghastly
manner
i
i
will
if
i
do
not
appear
for
a
week
frere
you
will
know
the
a
week
surely
it
will
not
last
so
long
as
that
exclaims
sylvia
the
ambiguous
it
appears
to
annoy
him
for
he
flushes
painfully
replying
sometimes
longer
it
is
a
um
uncertain
in
a
confused
and
manner
and
is
luckily
relieved
by
the
entry
of
jenkins
a
message
from
troke
troke
what
the
matter
now
dawes
sir
been
violent
and
assaulted
troke
troke
said
you
left
orders
to
be
told
at
onst
of
the
insubordination
of
quite
right
where
is
he
in
the
cells
i
think
sir
they
had
a
hard
fight
to
get
him
there
i
am
told
your
had
they
give
my
compliments
to
troke
and
tell
him
that
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
breaking
dawes
spirit
morning
at
nine
maurice
said
sylvia
who
had
been
listening
to
the
conversation
in
undisguised
alarm
do
me
a
favour
do
not
torment
this
what
makes
you
take
a
fancy
to
him
asks
her
husband
with
sudden
unnecessary
fierceness
because
his
is
one
of
the
names
which
have
been
from
my
childhood
synonymous
with
suffering
and
torture
because
whatever
wrong
he
may
have
done
his
punishment
must
have
in
some
degree
atoned
for
she
spoke
with
an
eager
pity
in
her
face
that
transfigured
it
north
devouring
her
with
his
glance
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
does
this
look
as
if
he
had
made
atonement
said
frere
coarsely
slapping
the
letter
he
is
a
bad
man
i
know
but
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
with
the
old
troubled
gesture
he
can
not
have
been
always
bad
i
think
i
have
heard
some
good
of
him
nonsense
said
frere
rising
decisively
your
fancies
mislead
you
let
me
hear
you
no
more
the
man
is
rebellious
and
must
be
lashed
back
again
to
his
duty
come
north
we
have
a
nip
before
you
mr
north
will
not
you
plead
for
me
suddenly
cried
poor
sylvia
her
overthrown
you
have
a
heart
to
pity
these
suffering
but
north
who
seemed
to
have
suddenly
recalled
his
soul
from
some
place
where
it
had
been
wandering
draws
himself
aside
and
with
dry
lips
makes
shift
to
say
i
can
not
interfere
with
your
husband
madam
and
goes
out
almost
rudely
you
made
old
north
quite
ill
said
frere
when
he
returns
hoping
by
bluff
ignoring
of
roughness
on
his
own
part
to
avoid
reproach
from
his
wife
he
drank
half
a
bottle
of
brandy
to
steady
his
nerves
before
he
went
home
and
swung
out
of
the
house
like
one
but
sylvia
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
did
not
reply
chapter
vii
breaking
a
man
spirit
the
insubordination
of
which
rufus
dawes
had
been
guilty
was
in
this
instance
insignificant
it
was
the
custom
of
the
constables
of
captain
frere
to
enter
the
wards
at
night
armed
with
cutlasses
tramping
about
and
making
a
great
noise
mindful
of
the
report
of
pounce
they
pulled
the
men
roughly
from
their
hammocks
examined
their
persons
for
concealed
tobacco
and
compelled
them
to
open
their
mouths
to
see
if
any
was
inside
the
men
in
dawes
gang
to
which
troke
had
an
especial
objection
were
often
searched
more
than
once
in
a
night
searched
going
to
work
searched
at
meals
searched
going
to
prayers
searched
coming
out
and
this
in
the
roughest
manner
their
sleep
broken
and
what
little
they
might
yet
presume
to
retain
harried
out
of
them
the
objects
of
this
incessant
persecution
were
ready
to
turn
upon
and
kill
their
tormentors
the
great
aim
of
troke
was
to
catch
dawes
tripping
but
the
leader
of
the
ring
was
far
too
wary
in
vain
had
troke
eager
to
sustain
his
reputation
for
sharpness
burst
in
upon
the
convict
at
all
times
and
seasons
he
had
found
nothing
in
vain
had
he
laid
traps
for
him
in
vain
had
he
planted
figs
of
tobacco
and
attached
long
threads
to
them
waited
in
a
bush
hard
by
until
the
pluck
at
the
end
of
his
line
should
give
token
that
the
fish
had
bitten
the
experienced
old
hand
was
too
acute
for
him
filled
with
disgust
and
ambition
he
determined
upon
an
ingenious
little
trick
he
was
certain
that
dawes
possessed
tobacco
the
thing
was
to
find
it
upon
him
now
rufus
dawes
holding
aloof
as
was
his
custom
from
the
majority
of
his
companions
had
made
one
friend
if
so
mindless
and
battered
an
old
wreck
could
be
called
a
friend
blind
mooney
perhaps
this
friendship
was
brought
about
by
two
causes
one
that
mooney
was
the
only
man
on
the
island
who
knew
more
of
the
horrors
of
convictism
than
the
leader
of
the
ring
the
other
that
mooney
was
blind
and
to
a
moody
sullen
man
subject
to
violent
fits
of
passion
and
a
constant
suspicion
of
all
his
a
blind
companion
was
more
congenial
than
a
one
mooney
was
one
of
the
first
fleeters
he
had
arrived
in
sydney
years
before
in
the
year
and
when
he
was
transported
he
was
fourteen
years
old
he
had
been
through
the
whole
round
of
servitude
had
worked
as
a
bondsman
had
married
and
been
up
country
had
been
again
sentenced
and
was
a
sort
of
dismal
patriarch
of
norfolk
island
having
been
there
at
its
former
settlement
he
had
no
friends
his
wife
was
long
since
dead
and
he
stated
without
contradiction
that
his
master
having
taken
a
fancy
to
her
had
despatched
the
uncomplaisant
husband
to
imprisonment
such
cases
were
not
uncommon
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
rufus
dawes
had
obtained
the
affection
of
the
old
blind
man
was
a
gift
of
such
fragments
of
tobacco
as
he
had
himself
from
time
to
time
secured
troke
knew
this
and
on
the
evening
in
question
hit
upon
an
excellent
plan
admitting
himself
noiselessly
into
the
where
the
gang
slept
he
crept
close
to
the
sleeping
dawes
and
counterfeiting
mooney
mumbling
utterance
asked
for
some
tobacco
rufus
dawes
was
but
half
awake
and
on
repeating
his
request
troke
felt
something
put
into
his
hand
he
grasped
dawes
arm
and
struck
a
light
he
had
got
his
man
this
time
dawes
had
conveyed
to
his
fancied
friend
a
piece
of
tobacco
almost
as
big
as
the
top
joint
of
his
little
finger
one
can
understand
the
feelings
of
a
man
entrapped
by
such
base
means
rufus
dawes
no
sooner
saw
the
hated
face
of
warder
troke
peering
over
his
hammock
then
he
sprang
out
and
exerting
to
the
utmost
his
powerful
muscles
knocked
troke
fairly
off
his
legs
into
the
arms
of
the
constables
a
desperate
struggle
took
place
at
the
end
of
which
the
convict
overpowered
by
numbers
was
borne
senseless
to
the
cells
gagged
and
chained
to
the
on
the
bare
flags
while
in
this
condition
he
was
savagely
beaten
by
five
or
six
constables
to
this
maimed
and
manacled
rebel
was
the
commandant
ushered
by
troke
the
next
morning
ha
ha
my
man
said
the
commandant
here
you
are
again
you
see
how
do
you
like
this
sort
of
thing
dawes
glaring
makes
no
answer
you
shall
have
fifty
lashes
my
man
said
frere
we
see
how
you
feel
then
the
fifty
were
duly
administered
and
the
commandant
called
the
next
day
the
rebel
was
still
mute
give
him
fifty
more
troke
we
see
what
he
made
one
hundred
and
twenty
lashes
were
inflicted
in
the
course
of
the
morning
but
still
the
sullen
convict
refused
to
speak
he
was
then
treated
to
fourteen
days
solitary
confinement
in
one
of
the
new
cells
on
being
brought
out
and
confronted
with
his
tormentor
he
merely
laughed
for
this
he
was
sent
back
for
another
fourteen
days
and
still
remaining
obdurate
was
flogged
again
and
got
fourteen
days
more
had
the
chaplain
then
visited
him
he
might
have
found
him
open
to
consolation
but
the
chaplain
so
it
was
stated
was
sick
when
brought
out
at
the
conclusion
of
his
third
confinement
he
was
found
to
be
in
so
exhausted
a
condition
that
the
doctor
ordered
him
to
hospital
as
soon
as
he
was
sufficiently
recovered
frere
visited
him
and
finding
his
spirit
not
yet
broken
ordered
that
he
should
be
put
to
grind
maize
dawes
declined
to
work
so
they
chained
his
hand
to
one
arm
of
the
grindstone
and
placed
another
prisoner
at
the
other
arm
as
the
second
prisoner
turned
the
hand
of
dawes
of
course
revolved
you
not
such
a
pebble
as
folks
seemed
to
think
grinned
frere
pointing
to
the
turning
wheel
upon
which
the
indomitable
poor
devil
straightened
his
muscles
and
prevented
the
wheel
from
turning
at
all
frere
gave
him
fifty
more
lashes
and
sent
him
the
next
day
to
grind
cayenne
pepper
this
was
a
punishment
more
dreaded
by
the
convicts
than
any
other
the
pungent
dust
filled
their
eyes
and
lungs
causing
them
the
most
excruciating
torments
for
a
man
with
a
raw
back
the
work
was
one
continued
agony
in
four
days
rufus
dawes
emaciated
blistered
blinded
broke
down
for
god
sake
captain
frere
kill
me
at
once
he
said
no
fear
said
the
other
rejoiced
at
this
proof
of
his
power
given
in
that
all
i
wanted
troke
take
him
off
to
the
when
he
was
in
hospital
north
visited
him
i
would
have
come
to
see
you
before
said
the
clergyman
but
i
have
been
very
in
truth
he
looked
so
he
had
had
a
fever
it
seemed
and
they
had
shaved
his
beard
and
cropped
his
hair
dawes
could
see
that
the
haggard
wasted
man
had
passed
through
some
agony
almost
as
great
as
his
own
the
next
day
frere
visited
him
complimented
him
on
his
courage
and
offered
to
make
him
a
constable
dawes
turned
his
scarred
back
to
his
torturer
and
resolutely
declined
to
answer
i
am
afraid
you
have
made
an
enemy
of
the
commandant
said
north
the
next
day
why
not
accept
his
offer
dawes
cast
on
him
a
glance
of
quiet
scorn
and
betray
my
mates
i
not
one
of
that
the
clergyman
spoke
to
him
of
hope
of
release
of
repentance
and
redemption
the
prisoner
laughed
who
to
redeem
me
he
said
expressing
his
thoughts
in
phraseology
that
to
ordinary
folks
might
seem
blasphemous
it
would
take
a
christ
to
die
again
to
save
such
as
north
spoke
to
him
of
immortality
there
is
another
life
said
he
do
not
risk
your
chance
of
happiness
in
it
you
have
a
future
to
live
for
i
hope
not
said
the
victim
of
the
system
i
want
to
rest
to
rest
and
never
to
be
disturbed
his
spirit
was
broken
enough
by
this
time
yet
he
had
resolution
enough
to
refuse
frere
repeated
offers
i
never
it
he
said
to
north
if
they
cut
me
in
half
north
pityingly
implored
the
stubborn
mind
to
have
mercy
on
the
lacerated
body
but
without
effect
his
own
wayward
heart
gave
him
the
key
to
read
the
cipher
of
this
man
life
a
noble
nature
ruined
said
he
to
himself
what
is
the
secret
of
his
history
dawes
on
his
part
seeing
how
different
from
other
black
coats
was
this
priest
at
once
so
ardent
and
so
gloomy
so
stern
and
so
tender
began
to
speculate
on
the
cause
of
his
monitor
sunken
cheeks
fiery
eyes
and
manner
to
wonder
what
grief
inspired
those
agonized
prayers
those
eloquent
and
daring
supplications
which
were
daily
poured
out
over
his
rude
bed
so
between
these
two
the
priest
and
the
sinner
was
a
sort
of
sympathetic
bond
one
day
this
bond
was
drawn
so
close
as
to
tug
at
both
their
the
chaplain
had
a
flower
in
his
coat
dawes
eyed
it
with
hungry
looks
and
as
the
clergyman
was
about
to
quit
the
room
said
mr
north
will
you
give
me
that
rosebud
north
paused
irresolutely
and
finally
as
if
after
a
struggle
with
himself
took
it
carefully
from
his
and
placed
it
in
the
prisoner
brown
scarred
hand
in
another
instant
dawes
believing
himself
alone
pressed
the
gift
to
his
lips
north
returned
abruptly
and
the
eyes
of
the
pair
met
dawes
flushed
crimson
but
north
turned
white
as
death
neither
spoke
but
each
was
drawn
close
to
the
other
since
both
had
kissed
the
rosebud
plucked
by
sylvia
fingers

extracted
from
the
diary
of
the
rev
james
north
october
i
am
safe
for
another
six
months
if
i
am
careful
for
my
last
bout
lasted
longer
than
i
expected
i
suppose
one
of
these
days
i
shall
have
a
paroxysm
that
will
kill
me
i
shall
not
regret
it
i
wonder
if
this
familiar
of
mine
i
begin
to
detest
the
expression
will
accuse
me
of
endeavouring
to
make
a
case
for
myself
if
i
say
that
i
believe
my
madness
to
be
a
disease
i
do
believe
it
i
honestly
can
no
more
help
getting
drunk
than
a
lunatic
can
help
screaming
and
gibbering
it
would
be
different
with
me
perhaps
were
i
a
contented
man
happily
married
with
children
about
me
and
family
cares
to
distract
me
but
as
i
am
a
lonely
gloomy
being
debarred
from
love
devoured
by
spleen
and
tortured
with
repressed
desires
i
become
a
living
torment
to
myself
i
think
of
happier
men
with
fair
wives
and
clinging
children
of
men
who
are
loved
and
who
love
of
frere
for
instance
and
a
hideous
wild
beast
seems
to
stir
within
me
a
monster
whose
cravings
can
not
be
satisfied
can
only
be
drowned
in
stupefying
brandy
penitent
and
shattered
i
vow
to
lead
a
new
life
to
forswear
spirits
to
drink
nothing
but
water
indeed
the
sight
and
smell
of
brandy
make
me
all
goes
well
for
some
weeks
when
i
grow
nervous
discontented
moody
i
smoke
and
am
soothed
but
moderation
is
not
to
be
thought
of
little
by
little
i
increase
the
dose
of
tobacco
five
pipes
a
day
become
six
or
seven
then
i
count
up
to
ten
and
twelve
then
drop
to
three
or
four
then
mount
to
eleven
at
a
leap
then
lose
count
altogether
much
smoking
excites
the
brain
i
feel
clear
bright
gay
my
tongue
is
parched
in
the
morning
however
and
i
use
liquor
to
literally
moisten
my
clay
i
drink
wine
or
beer
in
moderation
and
all
goes
well
my
limbs
regain
their
suppleness
my
hands
their
coolness
my
brain
its
placidity
i
begin
to
feel
that
i
have
a
will
i
am
confident
calm
and
hopeful
to
this
condition
succeeds
one
of
the
most
frightful
melancholy
i
remain
plunged
for
an
hour
together
in
a
stupor
of
despair
the
earth
air
sea
all
appear
barren
colourless
life
is
a
burden
i
long
to
sleep
and
sleeping
struggle
to
awake
because
of
the
awful
dreams
which
flap
about
me
in
the
darkness
at
night
i
cry
would
to
god
it
were
morning
in
the
morning
would
to
god
it
were
evening
i
loathe
myself
and
all
around
me
i
am
nerveless
passionless
bowed
down
with
a
burden
like
the
burden
of
saul
i
know
well
what
will
restore
me
to
life
and
ease
restore
me
but
to
cast
me
back
again
into
a
deeper
fit
of
despair
i
drink
one
glass
my
blood
is
warmed
my
heart
leaps
my
hand
no
longer
shakes
three
glasses
i
rise
with
hope
in
my
soul
the
evil
spirit
flies
from
me
i
continue
pleasing
images
flock
to
my
brain
the
fields
break
into
flower
the
birds
into
song
the
sea
gleams
sapphire
the
warm
heaven
laughs
great
god
what
man
could
withstand
a
temptation
like
this
by
an
effort
i
shake
off
the
desire
to
drink
deeper
and
fix
my
thoughts
on
my
duties
on
my
books
on
the
wretched
prisoners
i
succeed
perhaps
for
a
time
but
my
blood
heated
by
the
wine
which
is
at
once
my
poison
and
my
life
boils
in
my
veins
i
drink
again
and
dream
i
feel
all
the
animal
within
me
stirring
in
the
day
my
thoughts
wander
to
all
monstrous
imaginings
the
most
familiar
objects
suggest
to
me
loathsome
thoughts
obscene
and
filthy
images
surround
me
my
nature
seems
changed
by
day
i
feel
myself
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
a
man
possessed
by
a
devil
who
is
ready
at
any
moment
to
break
out
and
tear
him
to
pieces
at
night
i
become
a
satyr
while
in
this
torment
i
at
once
hate
and
fear
myself
one
fair
face
is
ever
before
me
gleaming
through
my
hot
dreams
like
a
flying
moon
in
the
sultry
midnight
of
a
tropic
storm
i
dare
not
trust
myself
in
the
presence
of
those
whom
i
love
and
respect
lest
my
wild
thoughts
should
find
vent
in
wilder
words
i
lose
my
humanity
i
am
a
beast
out
of
this
depth
there
is
but
one
way
of
escape
downwards
i
must
drench
the
monster
i
have
awakened
until
he
sleeps
again
i
drink
and
become
oblivious
in
these
last
paroxysms
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
brandy
i
shut
myself
up
alone
and
pour
down
my
gullet
huge
draughts
of
spirit
it
mounts
to
my
brain
i
am
a
man
again
and
as
i
regain
my
manhood
i
topple
over
dead
drunk
but
the
awakening
let
me
not
paint
it
the
delirium
the
fever
the
the
prostration
the
despair
i
view
in
the
a
haggard
face
with
red
eyes
i
look
down
upon
shaking
hands
flaccid
muscles
and
shrunken
limbs
i
speculate
if
i
shall
ever
be
one
of
those
grotesque
and
melancholy
beings
with
bleared
eyes
and
running
noses
swollen
bellies
and
shrunken
legs
ugh
it
is
too
likely
october
have
spent
the
day
with
frere
she
is
evidently
eager
to
leave
the
place
as
eager
as
i
am
frere
rejoices
in
his
murderous
power
and
laughs
at
her
expostulations
i
suppose
men
get
tired
of
their
wives
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
a
man
could
refuse
a
wife
anything
i
do
not
think
she
can
possibly
care
for
him
i
am
not
a
selfish
sentimentalist
as
are
the
majority
of
seducers
i
would
take
no
woman
away
from
a
husband
for
mere
liking
yet
i
think
there
are
cases
in
which
a
man
who
loved
would
be
justified
in
making
a
woman
happy
at
the
risk
of
his
own
soul
i
suppose
making
her
happy
ay
that
the
point
would
she
be
happy
there
are
few
men
who
can
endure
to
be
cut
slighted
pointed
at
and
women
suffer
more
than
men
in
these
regards
i
a
grizzled
man
of
forty
am
not
such
an
arrant
ass
as
to
suppose
that
a
year
of
guilty
delirium
can
compensate
to
a
woman
for
the
loss
of
that
social
dignity
which
constitutes
her
best
happiness
i
am
not
such
an
idiot
as
to
forget
that
there
may
come
a
time
when
the
woman
i
love
may
cease
to
love
me
and
having
no
tie
of
social
position
or
family
duty
to
bind
her
may
inflict
upon
her
seducer
that
agony
which
he
has
taught
her
to
inflict
upon
her
husband
apart
from
the
question
of
the
sin
of
breaking
the
seventh
commandment
i
doubt
if
the
worst
husband
and
the
most
unhappy
home
are
not
better
in
this
social
condition
of
ours
than
the
most
devoted
lover
a
strange
subject
this
for
a
clergyman
to
speculate
upon
if
this
diary
should
ever
fall
into
the
hands
of
a
real
honest
booby
who
never
was
tempted
to
sin
by
finding
that
at
he
loved
the
wife
of
another
how
he
would
condemn
me
and
rightly
of
course
november
in
one
of
the
turnkey
rooms
in
the
new
gaol
is
to
be
seen
an
article
of
harness
which
at
first
creates
surprise
to
the
mind
of
the
beholder
who
considers
what
animal
of
the
brute
creation
exists
of
so
diminutive
a
size
as
to
admit
of
its
use
on
inquiry
it
will
be
found
to
be
a
bridle
perfect
in
for
a
human
being
there
is
attached
to
this
bridle
a
round
piece
of
cross
wood
of
almost
four
inches
in
length
and
one
and
a
half
in
diameter
this
again
is
secured
to
a
broad
strap
of
leather
to
cross
the
mouth
in
the
wood
there
is
a
small
hole
and
when
used
the
wood
is
inserted
in
the
mouth
the
small
hole
being
the
only
breathing
space
this
being
secured
with
the
various
straps
and
buckles
a
more
complete
bridle
could
not
be
well
imagined
i
was
in
the
gaol
last
evening
at
eight
i
had
been
to
see
rufus
dawes
and
returning
paused
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
hailey
gimblett
who
robbed
vane
of
two
hundred
pounds
was
present
he
was
at
that
time
a
turnkey
holding
a
pass
and
in
receipt
of
two
shillings
per
diem
everything
was
quite
still
i
could
not
help
remarking
how
quiet
the
gaol
was
when
gimblett
said
there
someone
speaking
i
know
who
that
and
forthwith
took
from
its
pegs
one
of
the
bridles
just
described
and
a
pair
of
handcuffs
i
followed
him
to
one
of
the
cells
which
he
opened
and
therein
was
a
man
lying
on
his
straw
mat
undressed
and
to
all
appearance
fast
asleep
gimblett
ordered
him
to
get
up
and
dress
himself
he
did
so
and
came
into
the
yard
where
gimblett
inserted
the
gag
in
his
mouth
the
sound
produced
by
his
breathing
through
it
which
appeared
to
be
done
with
great
difficulty
resembled
a
low
indistinct
whistle
gimblett
led
him
to
the
in
the
yard
and
i
saw
that
the
victim
of
his
wanton
tyranny
was
the
poor
blind
wretch
mooney
gimblett
placed
him
with
his
back
against
the
and
his
arms
being
taken
round
were
secured
by
handcuffs
round
the
post
i
was
told
that
the
old
man
was
to
remain
in
this
condition
for
three
hours
i
went
at
once
to
the
commandant
he
invited
me
into
his
an
invitation
which
i
had
the
good
sense
to
refuse
but
refused
to
listen
to
any
plea
for
mercy
the
old
impostor
is
always
making
his
blindness
an
excuse
for
disobedience
said
and
this
is
her
husband
chapter
ix
the
longest
straw
rufus
dawes
hearing
when
on
the
chain
the
next
day
of
the
wanton
torture
of
his
friend
uttered
no
threat
of
vengeance
but
groaned
only
i
am
not
so
strong
as
i
was
said
he
as
if
in
apology
for
his
lack
of
spirit
they
have
unnerved
and
he
looked
sadly
down
at
his
gaunt
frame
and
trembling
hands
i
ca
stand
it
no
longer
said
mooney
grimly
i
spoken
to
bland
and
he
of
my
mind
you
know
what
we
resolved
to
do
let
do
rufus
dawes
stared
at
the
sightless
orbs
turned
inquiringly
to
his
own
the
fingers
of
his
hand
thrust
into
his
bosom
felt
a
token
which
lay
there
a
shudder
thrilled
him
no
no
not
now
he
said
you
not
afeard
man
asked
mooney
stretching
out
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
you
not
going
to
shirk
the
other
avoided
the
touch
and
shrank
away
still
staring
you
ai
going
to
back
out
after
you
swored
it
dawes
you
not
that
sort
dawes
speak
man
is
bland
willing
asked
dawes
looking
round
as
if
to
seek
some
method
of
escape
from
the
glare
of
those
unspeculative
eyes
ay
and
ready
they
flogged
him
again
leave
it
till
said
dawes
at
length
no
let
have
it
over
urged
the
old
man
with
a
strange
eagerness
i
tired
o
rufus
dawes
cast
a
wistful
glance
towards
the
wall
behind
which
lay
the
house
of
the
commandant
leave
it
till
he
repeated
with
his
hand
still
in
his
breast
they
had
been
so
occupied
in
their
conversation
that
neither
had
observed
the
approach
of
their
common
enemy
what
are
you
hiding
there
cried
frere
seizing
dawes
by
the
wrist
more
tobacco
you
dog
the
hand
of
the
convict
thus
suddenly
plucked
from
his
bosom
opened
involuntarily
and
a
withered
rose
fell
to
the
earth
frere
at
once
indignant
and
astonished
picked
it
up
hallo
what
the
this
you
not
been
robbing
my
garden
for
a
nosegay
jack
the
commandant
was
wont
to
call
all
convicts
jack
in
his
moments
of
facetiousness
it
was
a
little
humorous
way
he
had
rufus
dawes
uttered
one
dismal
cry
and
then
stood
trembling
and
cowed
his
companions
hearing
the
exclamation
of
rage
and
grief
that
burst
from
him
looked
to
see
him
snatch
back
the
flower
or
perform
some
act
of
violence
perhaps
such
was
his
intention
but
he
did
not
execute
it
one
would
have
thought
that
there
was
some
charm
about
this
rose
so
strangely
cherished
for
he
stood
gazing
at
it
as
it
twirled
between
captain
frere
strong
fingers
as
though
it
fascinated
him
you
a
pretty
man
to
want
a
rose
for
your
buttonhole
are
you
going
out
with
your
sweetheart
next
sunday
dawes
the
gang
laughed
how
did
you
get
this
dawes
was
silent
you
better
tell
no
answer
troke
let
us
see
if
we
ca
find
dawes
tongue
pull
off
your
shirt
my
man
i
expect
that
the
way
to
your
heart
eh
boys
at
this
elegant
allusion
to
the
lash
the
gang
laughed
again
and
looked
at
each
other
astonished
it
seemed
possible
that
the
leader
of
the
ring
was
going
to
turn
milksop
such
indeed
appeared
to
be
the
case
for
dawes
trembling
and
pale
cried
do
flog
me
again
sir
i
picked
it
up
in
the
yard
it
fell
out
of
your
coat
one
frere
smiled
with
an
inward
satisfaction
at
the
result
of
his
the
explanation
was
probably
the
correct
one
he
was
in
the
habit
of
wearing
flowers
in
his
coat
and
it
was
impossible
that
the
convict
should
have
obtained
one
by
any
other
means
had
it
been
a
fig
of
tobacco
now
the
astute
commandant
knew
plenty
of
men
who
would
have
brought
it
into
the
prison
but
who
would
risk
a
flogging
for
so
useless
a
thing
as
a
flower
you
better
not
pick
up
any
more
jack
he
said
we
do
grow
flowers
for
your
and
contemptuously
flinging
the
rose
over
the
wall
he
strode
away
the
gang
left
to
itself
for
a
moment
bestowed
their
attention
upon
dawes
large
tears
were
silently
rolling
down
his
face
and
he
stood
staring
at
the
wall
as
one
in
a
dream
the
gang
curled
their
lips
one
fellow
more
charitable
than
the
rest
tapped
his
forehead
and
winked
he
going
cranky
said
this
man
who
could
not
understand
what
a
sane
prisoner
had
to
do
with
flowers
dawes
recovered
himself
and
the
contemptuous
glances
of
his
companions
seemed
to
bring
back
the
colour
to
his
cheeks
we
do
it
whispered
he
to
mooney
and
mooney
smiled
with
pleasure
since
the
tobacco
trick
mooney
and
dawes
had
been
placed
in
the
new
prison
together
with
a
man
named
bland
who
had
already
twice
failed
to
kill
himself
when
old
mooney
fresh
from
the
torture
of
the
lamented
his
hard
case
bland
proposed
that
the
three
should
put
in
practice
a
scheme
in
which
two
at
least
must
succeed
the
scheme
was
a
desperate
one
and
attempted
only
in
the
last
extremity
it
was
the
custom
of
the
ring
however
to
swear
each
of
its
members
to
carry
out
to
the
best
of
his
ability
this
last
invention
of
the
mind
should
two
other
members
crave
his
assistance
the
scheme
like
all
great
ideas
was
simplicity
itself
that
evening
when
the
was
securely
locked
and
the
absence
of
a
visiting
gaoler
might
be
counted
upon
for
an
hour
at
least
bland
produced
a
straw
and
held
it
out
to
his
companions
dawes
took
it
and
tearing
it
into
unequal
lengths
handed
the
fragments
to
mooney
the
longest
is
the
one
said
the
blind
man
come
on
boys
and
dip
in
the
it
was
evident
that
lots
were
to
be
drawn
to
determine
to
whom
fortune
would
grant
freedom
the
men
drew
in
silence
and
then
bland
and
dawes
looked
at
each
other
the
prize
had
been
left
in
the
bag
mooney
fortunate
old
fellow
retained
the
longest
straw
bland
hand
shook
as
he
compared
notes
with
his
companion
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
blank
eyeballs
of
the
blind
man
fiercely
searched
the
gloom
as
if
in
that
awful
moment
they
could
penetrate
it
i
hold
the
shortest
said
dawes
to
bland
is
you
that
must
do
i
glad
of
that
said
mooney
bland
seemingly
terrified
at
the
danger
which
fate
had
decreed
that
he
should
run
tore
the
fatal
lot
into
fragments
with
an
oath
and
sat
gnawing
his
knuckles
in
excess
of
abject
terror
mooney
stretched
himself
out
upon
his
come
on
mate
he
said
bland
extended
a
shaking
hand
and
caught
rufus
dawes
by
the
sleeve
you
have
more
nerve
than
i
you
do
no
no
said
dawes
almost
as
pale
as
his
companion
i
run
my
chance
fairly
was
your
own
the
coward
who
confident
in
his
own
luck
would
seem
to
have
fallen
into
the
pit
he
had
dug
for
others
sat
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
holding
his
head
in
his
hands
by
heaven
i
ca
do
it
he
whispered
lifting
a
white
wet
face
what
are
you
waiting
for
said
fortunate
mooney
come
on
i
i
i
thought
you
might
like
to
to
pray
a
bit
said
bland
the
notion
seemed
to
sober
the
senses
of
the
old
man
exalted
too
fiercely
by
his
good
fortune
ay
he
said
pray
a
good
thought
and
he
knelt
down
and
shutting
his
blind
eyes
was
as
though
he
was
dazzled
by
some
strong
light
unseen
by
his
comrades
moved
his
lips
silently
the
silence
was
at
last
broken
by
the
footsteps
of
the
warder
in
the
corridor
bland
hailed
it
as
a
reprieve
from
whatever
act
of
daring
he
dreaded
we
must
wait
until
he
goes
he
whispered
eagerly
he
might
look
dawes
nodded
and
mooney
whose
quick
ear
apprised
him
very
exactly
of
the
position
of
the
approaching
gaoler
rose
from
his
knees
radiant
the
sour
face
of
gimblett
appeared
at
the
trap
all
right
he
asked
somewhat
so
the
three
thought
less
sourly
than
usual
all
right
was
the
reply
and
mooney
added
i
wonder
what
is
making
the
old
man
so
cheerful
thought
gimblett
as
he
got
into
the
next
corridor
the
sound
of
his
echoing
footsteps
had
scarcely
died
away
when
upon
the
ears
of
the
two
less
fortunate
casters
of
lots
fell
the
dull
sound
of
rending
woollen
the
lucky
man
was
tearing
a
strip
from
his
blanket
i
think
this
will
do
said
he
pulling
it
between
his
hands
to
test
its
strength
i
am
an
old
it
was
possible
that
he
debated
concerning
the
descent
of
some
abyss
into
which
the
strip
of
blanket
was
to
lower
him
here
bland
catch
hold
where
are
ye
do
be
man
it
wo
take
ye
it
was
quite
dark
now
in
the
cell
but
as
bland
advanced
his
face
was
like
a
white
mask
floating
upon
the
darkness
it
was
so
ghastly
pale
dawes
pressed
his
lucky
comrade
hand
and
withdrew
to
the
farthest
corner
bland
and
mooney
were
for
a
few
moments
occupied
with
the
rope
doubtless
preparing
for
escape
by
means
of
it
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
convulsive
jangling
of
bland
irons
he
was
shuddering
violently
at
last
mooney
spoke
again
in
strangely
soft
and
subdued
tones
dawes
lad
do
you
think
there
is
a
heaven
i
know
there
is
a
hell
said
dawes
without
turning
his
face
ay
and
a
heaven
lad
i
think
i
shall
go
there
you
will
old
chap
for
you
been
good
to
me
god
bless
you
you
been
very
good
to
when
troke
came
in
the
morning
he
saw
what
had
occurred
at
a
glance
and
hastened
to
remove
the
corpse
of
the
strangled
mooney
we
drew
lots
said
rufus
dawes
pointing
to
bland
who
crouched
in
the
corner
farthest
from
his
victim
and
it
fell
upon
him
to
do
it
i
the
they
hang
you
for
all
that
said
troke
i
hope
so
said
rufus
dawes
the
scheme
of
escape
hit
upon
by
the
convict
intellect
was
simply
this
three
men
being
together
lots
were
drawn
to
determine
whom
should
be
murdered
the
drawer
of
the
longest
straw
was
the
lucky
man
he
was
killed
the
drawer
of
the
next
longest
straw
was
the
murderer
he
was
hanged
the
unlucky
one
was
the
witness
he
had
of
course
an
excellent
chance
of
being
hung
also
but
his
doom
was
not
so
certain
and
he
therefore
looked
upon
himself
as
unfortunate
chapter
x
a
meeting
john
rex
found
the
george
disagreeably
prepared
for
his
august
arrival
obsequious
waiters
took
his
and
overcoat
the
landlord
himself
welcomed
him
at
the
door
two
naval
gentlemen
came
out
of
the
to
stare
at
him
have
you
any
more
luggage
devine
asked
the
landlord
as
he
flung
open
the
door
of
the
best
it
was
awkwardly
evident
that
his
wife
had
no
notion
of
suffering
him
to
hide
his
borrowed
light
under
a
bushel
a
laid
for
two
people
gleamed
bright
from
the
cheeriest
corner
a
fire
crackled
beneath
the
marble
mantelshelf
the
latest
evening
paper
lay
upon
a
chair
and
brushing
it
carelessly
with
her
costly
dress
the
woman
he
had
so
basely
deserted
came
smiling
to
meet
him
well
richard
devine
said
she
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
again
did
you
although
on
his
journey
down
he
had
composed
an
elaborate
speech
wherewith
to
greet
her
this
unnatural
civility
dumbfounded
him
sarah
i
never
meant
to
hush
my
dear
richard
it
must
be
richard
now
i
suppose
this
is
not
the
time
for
explanations
besides
the
waiter
might
hear
you
let
us
have
some
supper
you
must
be
hungry
i
am
he
advanced
to
the
table
mechanically
but
how
fat
you
are
she
continued
too
good
living
i
suppose
you
were
not
so
fat
at
port
ar
i
forgot
my
dear
come
and
sit
down
that
right
i
have
told
them
all
that
i
am
your
wife
for
whom
you
have
sent
they
regard
me
with
some
interest
and
respect
in
consequence
do
spoil
their
good
opinion
of
he
was
about
to
utter
an
imprecation
but
she
stopped
him
by
a
glance
no
bad
language
john
or
i
shall
ring
for
a
constable
let
us
understand
one
another
my
dear
you
may
be
a
very
great
man
to
other
people
but
to
me
you
are
merely
my
runaway
husband
an
escaped
convict
if
you
do
eat
your
supper
civilly
i
shall
send
for
the
sarah
he
burst
out
i
never
meant
to
desert
you
upon
my
word
it
is
all
a
mistake
let
me
there
is
no
need
for
explanations
yet
jack
i
mean
richard
have
your
supper
ah
i
know
what
you
she
poured
out
half
a
tumbler
of
brandy
and
gave
it
to
him
he
took
the
glass
from
her
hand
drank
the
contents
and
then
as
though
warmed
by
the
spirit
laughed
what
a
woman
you
are
sarah
i
have
been
a
great
brute
i
you
have
been
an
ungrateful
villain
said
she
with
sudden
passion
a
hardened
selfish
but
sarah
do
touch
me
my
word
you
are
a
fine
creature
and
i
was
a
fool
to
leave
the
compliment
seemed
to
soothe
her
for
her
tone
changed
somewhat
it
was
a
wicked
cruel
act
jack
you
whom
i
saved
from
death
whom
i
nursed
whom
i
enriched
it
was
the
act
of
a
i
admit
it
it
you
admit
it
have
you
no
shame
then
have
you
no
pity
for
me
for
what
i
have
suffered
all
these
years
i
do
suppose
you
cared
do
you
you
never
thought
about
me
at
all
i
have
cared
this
much
john
rex
bah
the
door
is
shut
close
enough
that
i
have
spent
a
fortune
in
hunting
you
down
and
now
i
have
found
you
i
will
make
you
suffer
in
your
he
laughed
again
but
uneasily
how
did
you
discover
me
with
a
readiness
which
showed
that
she
had
already
prepared
an
answer
to
the
question
she
unlocked
a
which
was
on
the
side
table
and
took
from
it
a
newspaper
by
one
of
those
strange
accidents
which
are
the
ruin
of
men
like
you
among
the
papers
sent
to
the
overseer
from
his
english
friends
was
this
she
held
out
an
illustrated
journal
a
sunday
organ
of
sporting
opinion
and
pointed
to
a
portrait
engraved
on
the
centre
page
it
represented
a
bearded
man
dressed
in
the
fashion
affected
by
turfites
and
lovers
of
standing
beside
a
pedestal
on
which
were
piled
a
variety
of
racing
cups
and
trophies
john
rex
read
underneath
this
work
of
art
the
name
richard
devine
the
leviathan
of
the
turf
and
you
recognized
me
the
portrait
was
sufficiently
like
you
to
induce
me
to
make
inquiries
and
when
i
found
that
richard
devine
had
suddenly
returned
from
a
mysterious
absence
of
fourteen
years
i
set
to
work
in
earnest
i
have
spent
a
deal
of
money
jack
but
i
got
you
you
have
been
clever
in
finding
me
out
i
give
you
credit
for
there
is
not
a
single
act
of
your
life
john
rex
that
i
do
not
know
she
continued
with
heat
i
have
traced
you
from
the
day
you
stole
out
of
my
house
until
now
i
know
your
continental
trips
your
journeyings
here
and
there
in
search
of
a
lost
clue
i
pieced
together
the
puzzle
as
you
have
done
and
i
know
that
by
some
foul
fortune
you
have
stolen
the
secret
of
a
dead
man
to
ruin
an
innocent
and
virtuous
hullo
hullo
said
john
rex
since
when
have
you
learnt
to
talk
of
virtue
it
is
well
to
taunt
but
you
have
got
to
the
end
of
your
tether
now
jack
i
have
communicated
with
the
woman
whose
son
fortune
you
have
stolen
i
expect
to
hear
from
lady
devine
in
a
day
or
well
and
when
you
hear
i
shall
give
back
the
fortune
at
the
price
of
her
silence
ho
ho
will
you
yes
and
if
my
husband
does
not
come
back
and
live
with
me
quietly
i
shall
call
the
john
rex
sprang
up
who
will
believe
you
idiot
he
cried
i
have
you
sent
to
gaol
as
an
you
forget
my
dear
she
returned
playing
coquettishly
with
her
rings
and
glancing
sideways
as
she
spoke
that
you
have
already
acknowledged
me
as
your
wife
before
the
landlord
and
the
servants
it
is
too
late
for
that
sort
of
thing
oh
my
dear
jack
you
think
you
are
very
clever
but
i
am
as
clever
as
smothering
a
curse
he
sat
down
beside
her
listen
sarah
what
is
the
use
of
fighting
like
a
couple
of
children
i
am
rich
so
am
well
so
much
the
better
we
will
join
our
riches
together
i
admit
that
i
was
a
fool
and
a
cur
to
leave
you
but
i
played
for
a
great
stake
the
name
of
richard
devine
was
worth
nearly
half
a
million
in
money
it
is
mine
i
won
it
share
it
with
me
sarah
you
and
i
defied
the
world
years
ago
do
let
us
quarrel
now
i
was
ungrateful
forget
it
we
know
by
this
time
that
we
are
not
either
of
us
angels
we
started
in
life
together
do
you
remember
sally
when
i
met
you
first
determined
to
make
money
we
have
succeeded
why
then
set
to
work
to
destroy
each
other
you
are
handsomer
than
ever
i
have
not
lost
my
wits
is
there
any
need
for
you
to
tell
the
world
that
i
am
a
runaway
convict
and
that
you
are
well
no
of
course
there
is
no
need
kiss
and
be
friends
sarah
i
would
have
escaped
you
if
i
could
i
admit
you
have
found
me
out
i
accept
the
position
you
claim
me
as
your
husband
you
say
you
are
richard
devine
very
well
i
admit
it
you
have
all
your
life
wanted
to
be
a
great
lady
now
is
your
chance
much
as
she
had
cause
to
hate
him
well
as
she
knew
his
treacherous
and
ungrateful
character
little
as
she
had
reason
to
trust
him
her
strange
and
distempered
affection
for
the
scoundrel
came
upon
her
again
with
gathering
strength
as
she
sat
beside
him
listening
to
the
familiar
tones
of
the
voice
she
had
learned
to
love
greedily
drinking
in
the
promise
of
a
future
fidelity
which
she
was
well
aware
was
made
but
to
be
broken
her
memory
recalled
the
past
days
of
trust
and
happiness
and
her
woman
fancy
once
more
invested
the
selfish
villain
she
had
reclaimed
with
those
attributes
which
had
enchained
her
wilful
and
wayward
affections
the
unselfish
devotion
which
had
marked
her
conduct
to
the
swindler
and
convict
was
indeed
her
one
redeeming
virtue
and
perhaps
she
felt
dimly
poor
woman
that
it
were
better
for
her
to
cling
to
that
if
she
lost
all
the
world
beside
her
wish
for
vengeance
melted
under
the
influence
of
these
thoughts
the
bitterness
of
despised
love
the
shame
and
anger
of
desertion
ingratitude
and
betrayal
all
vanished
the
tears
of
a
sweet
forgiveness
trembled
in
her
eyes
the
unreasoning
love
of
her
sex
faithful
to
nought
but
love
and
faithful
to
love
in
death
shook
in
her
voice
she
took
his
coward
hand
and
kissed
it
pardoning
all
his
baseness
with
the
sole
reproach
oh
john
john
you
might
have
trusted
me
after
all
john
rex
had
conquered
and
he
smiled
as
he
embraced
her
i
wish
i
had
said
he
it
would
have
saved
me
many
regrets
but
never
mind
sit
down
now
we
will
have
your
preference
has
one
drawback
sarah
he
said
when
the
meal
was
concluded
and
the
two
sat
down
to
consider
their
immediate
course
of
action
it
doubles
the
chance
of
how
so
people
have
accepted
me
without
inquiry
but
i
am
afraid
not
without
dislike
francis
wade
my
uncle
never
liked
me
and
i
fear
i
have
not
played
my
cards
well
with
lady
devine
when
they
find
i
have
a
mysterious
wife
their
dislike
will
become
suspicion
is
it
likely
that
i
should
have
been
married
all
these
years
and
not
have
informed
them
very
unlikely
returned
sarah
calmly
and
that
is
just
the
reason
why
you
have
not
been
married
all
these
years
really
she
added
with
a
laugh
the
male
intellect
is
very
dull
you
have
already
told
ten
thousand
lies
about
this
affair
and
yet
you
do
see
your
way
to
tell
one
what
do
you
mean
why
my
dear
richard
you
surely
can
not
have
forgotten
that
you
married
me
last
year
on
the
continent
by
the
way
it
was
last
year
that
you
were
there
was
it
not
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
poor
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
name
anything
you
please
and
you
met
me
where
shall
we
say
baden
aix
brussels
cross
the
alps
if
you
like
dear
and
say
john
rex
put
his
hand
to
his
head
of
course
i
am
stupid
said
he
i
have
not
been
well
lately
too
much
brandy
i
well
we
will
alter
all
that
she
returned
with
a
laugh
which
her
anxious
glance
at
him
belied
you
are
going
to
be
domestic
now
jack
i
mean
go
on
said
he
impatiently
what
then
then
having
settled
these
little
preliminaries
you
take
me
up
to
london
and
introduce
me
to
your
relatives
and
he
started
a
bold
bold
nonsense
the
only
safe
one
people
do
as
a
rule
suspect
unless
one
is
mysterious
you
must
do
it
i
have
arranged
for
your
doing
it
the
waiters
here
all
know
me
as
your
wife
there
is
not
the
least
danger
unless
indeed
you
are
married
already
she
added
with
a
quick
and
angry
suspicion
you
need
not
be
alarmed
i
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
marry
another
woman
while
you
were
alive
had
i
even
seen
one
i
would
have
cared
to
marry
but
what
of
lady
devine
you
say
you
have
told
i
have
told
her
to
communicate
with
carr
post
office
torquay
in
order
to
hear
something
to
her
advantage
if
you
had
been
rebellious
john
the
would
have
been
a
letter
from
me
telling
her
who
you
really
are
now
you
have
proved
obedient
the
will
be
a
begging
letter
of
a
sort
which
she
has
already
received
hundreds
and
which
in
all
probability
she
will
not
even
answer
what
do
you
think
of
that
richard
devine
you
deserve
success
sarah
said
the
old
schemer
in
genuine
admiration
by
jove
this
is
something
like
the
old
days
when
we
were
and
or
and
skinner
eh
john
she
said
with
as
much
tenderness
in
her
voice
as
though
she
had
been
a
virtuous
matron
recalling
her
honeymoon
that
was
an
unlucky
name
was
it
dear
you
should
have
taken
my
advice
and
immersed
in
recollection
of
their
past
rogueries
the
worthy
pair
pensively
smiled
rex
was
the
first
to
awake
from
that
pleasant
reverie
i
will
be
guided
by
you
then
he
said
what
next
next
for
as
you
say
my
presence
doubles
the
danger
we
will
contrive
to
withdraw
quietly
from
england
the
introduction
to
your
mother
over
and
francis
disposed
of
we
will
go
to
hampstead
and
live
there
for
a
while
during
that
time
you
must
turn
into
cash
as
much
property
as
you
dare
we
will
then
go
abroad
for
the
and
stop
there
after
a
year
or
so
on
the
continent
you
can
write
to
our
agent
to
sell
more
property
and
finally
when
we
are
regarded
as
permanent
absentees
and
three
or
four
years
will
bring
that
about
we
will
get
rid
of
everything
and
slip
over
to
america
then
you
can
endow
a
charity
if
you
like
or
build
a
church
to
the
memory
of
the
man
you
have
john
rex
burst
into
a
laugh
an
excellent
plan
i
like
the
idea
of
the
charity
the
devine
hospital
eh
by
the
way
how
did
you
find
out
the
particulars
of
this
man
life
he
was
burned
in
the
hydaspes
was
he
no
said
rex
with
an
air
of
pride
he
was
transported
in
the
malabar
under
the
name
of
rufus
dawes
you
remember
him
it
is
a
long
story
the
particulars
were
numerous
and
if
the
old
lady
had
been
half
sharp
she
would
have
bowled
me
out
but
the
fact
was
she
wanted
to
find
the
fellow
alive
and
was
willing
to
take
a
good
deal
on
trust
i
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
i
think
i
go
to
bed
now
i
tired
and
my
head
aches
as
though
it
would
then
it
is
decided
that
you
follow
my
directions
she
rose
and
placed
her
hand
on
the
bell
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
uneasily
i
am
going
to
do
nothing
you
are
going
to
telegraph
to
your
servants
to
have
the
house
in
london
prepared
for
your
wife
who
will
return
with
you
the
day
after
john
rex
stayed
her
hand
with
a
sudden
angry
gesture
this
is
all
devilish
fine
he
said
but
suppose
it
fails
that
is
your
affair
john
you
need
not
go
on
with
this
business
at
all
unless
you
like
i
had
rather
you
what
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
then
i
am
not
as
rich
as
you
are
but
with
my
station
and
so
on
i
am
worth
seven
thousand
a
year
come
back
to
australia
with
me
and
let
these
poor
people
enjoy
their
own
again
ah
john
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
believe
me
we
can
afford
to
be
honest
a
fine
scheme
cried
he
give
up
half
a
million
of
money
and
go
back
to
australia
you
must
be
mad
then
but
my
dear
hush
here
the
as
he
wrote
john
rex
felt
gloomily
that
though
he
had
succeeded
in
recalling
her
affection
that
affection
was
as
imperious
as
of
yore
chapter
xi
extracted
from
the
diary
of
the
rev
james
north
december
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
this
place
to
bury
myself
again
in
the
bush
i
suppose
and
await
extinction
i
try
to
think
that
the
reason
for
this
determination
is
the
frightful
condition
of
misery
existing
among
the
prisoners
that
because
i
am
daily
horrified
and
sickened
by
scenes
of
torture
and
infamy
i
decide
to
go
away
that
feeling
myself
powerless
to
save
others
i
wish
to
spare
myself
but
in
this
journal
in
which
i
bind
myself
to
write
nothing
but
truth
i
am
forced
to
confess
that
these
are
not
the
reasons
i
will
write
the
reason
plainly
i
covet
my
neighbour
it
does
not
look
well
thus
written
it
looks
hideous
in
my
own
breast
i
find
numberless
excuses
for
my
passion
i
said
to
myself
my
neighbour
does
not
love
his
wife
and
her
unloved
life
is
misery
she
is
forced
to
live
in
the
frightful
seclusion
of
this
accursed
island
and
she
is
dying
for
want
of
companionship
she
feels
that
i
understand
and
appreciate
her
that
i
could
love
her
as
she
deserves
that
i
could
render
her
happy
i
feel
that
i
have
met
the
only
woman
who
has
power
to
touch
my
heart
to
hold
me
back
from
the
ruin
into
which
i
am
about
to
plunge
to
make
me
useful
to
my
fellows
a
man
and
not
a
whispering
these
conclusions
to
myself
i
am
urged
to
brave
public
opinion
and
make
two
lives
happy
i
say
to
myself
or
rather
my
desires
say
to
me
what
sin
is
there
in
this
adultery
no
for
a
marriage
without
love
is
the
coarsest
of
all
adulteries
what
tie
binds
a
man
and
woman
together
that
formula
of
license
pronounced
by
the
priest
which
the
law
has
recognized
as
a
bond
surely
not
this
only
for
marriage
is
but
a
partnership
a
contract
of
mutual
fidelity
and
in
all
contracts
the
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
agreement
by
one
of
the
contracting
persons
absolves
the
other
frere
is
then
absolved
by
her
husband
act
i
can
not
but
think
so
but
is
she
willing
to
risk
the
shame
of
divorce
or
legal
offence
perhaps
is
she
fitted
by
temperament
to
bear
such
a
burden
of
contumely
as
must
needs
fall
upon
her
will
she
not
feel
disgust
at
the
man
who
entrapped
her
into
shame
do
not
the
comforts
which
surround
her
compensate
for
the
lack
of
affections
and
so
the
torturing
catechism
continues
until
i
am
driven
mad
with
doubt
love
and
despair
of
course
i
am
wrong
of
course
i
outrage
my
character
as
a
priest
of
course
i
endanger
according
to
the
creed
i
teach
my
soul
and
hers
but
priests
unluckily
have
hearts
and
passions
as
well
as
other
men
thank
god
as
yet
i
have
never
expressed
my
madness
in
words
what
a
fate
is
mine
when
i
am
in
her
presence
i
am
in
torment
when
i
am
absent
from
her
my
imagination
pictures
her
surrounded
by
a
thousand
graces
that
are
not
hers
but
belong
to
all
the
women
of
my
dreams
to
helen
to
juliet
to
rosalind
fools
that
we
are
of
our
own
senses
when
i
think
of
her
i
blush
when
i
hear
her
name
my
heart
leaps
and
i
grow
pale
love
what
is
the
love
of
two
pure
souls
scarce
conscious
of
the
paradise
into
which
they
have
fallen
to
this
maddening
delirium
i
can
understand
the
poison
of
circe
cup
it
is
the
of
a
forbidden
love
like
mine
away
gross
materialism
in
which
i
have
so
long
schooled
myself
i
who
laughed
at
passion
as
the
outcome
of
temperament
and
easy
living
i
who
thought
in
my
intellect
to
sound
all
the
depths
and
shoals
of
human
feeling
i
who
analysed
my
own
soul
scoffed
at
my
own
yearnings
for
an
immortality
am
forced
to
deify
the
senseless
power
of
my
creed
and
believe
in
god
that
i
may
pray
to
him
i
know
now
why
men
reject
the
cold
impersonality
that
reason
tells
us
rules
the
world
it
is
because
they
love
to
die
and
be
no
more
to
die
and
rendered
into
dust
be
blown
about
the
earth
to
die
and
leave
our
love
defenceless
and
forlorn
till
the
bright
soul
that
smiled
to
ours
is
smothered
in
the
earth
that
made
it
no
to
love
is
life
eternal
god
i
believe
in
thee
aid
me
pity
me
sinful
wretch
that
i
am
to
have
denied
thee
see
me
on
my
knees
before
thee
pity
me
or
let
me
die
december
i
have
been
visiting
the
two
condemned
prisoners
dawes
and
bland
and
praying
with
them
o
lord
let
me
save
one
soul
that
may
plead
with
thee
for
mine
let
me
draw
one
being
alive
out
of
this
pit
i
weep
i
weary
thee
with
my
prayers
o
lord
look
down
upon
me
grant
me
a
sign
thou
didst
it
in
old
times
to
men
who
were
not
more
fervent
in
their
supplications
than
am
i
so
says
thy
book
thy
book
which
i
believe
which
i
believe
grant
me
a
sign
one
little
sign
o
lord
i
will
not
see
her
i
have
sworn
it
thou
knowest
my
grief
my
agony
my
despair
thou
knowest
why
i
love
her
thou
knowest
how
i
strive
to
make
her
hate
me
is
that
not
a
sacrifice
i
am
so
lonely
a
lonely
man
with
but
one
creature
that
he
loves
yet
what
is
mortal
love
to
thee
cruel
and
implacable
thou
sittest
in
the
heavens
men
have
built
for
thee
and
scornest
them

not
all
the
burnings
and
slaughters
of
the

with
blood
and

of
vengeance
of
wrath
and
of
despair
kind
christ
pity
me
thou
wilt
for
thou
wast
human
blessed
saviour
at
whose
feet
knelt
the
magdalen
divinity
who
most
divine
in
thy
despair
called
on
thy
cruel
god
to
save
thee
by
the
memory
of
that
moment
when
thou
didst
deem
thyself
forsaken
forsake
not
me
sweet
christ
have
mercy
on
thy
sinful
servant
i
can
write
no
more
i
will
pray
to
thee
with
my
lips

will
shriek
my
supplications
to
thee
i
will
call
upon
thee
so
loud
that
all
the
world
shall
hear
me
and
wonder
at
thy
silence
unjust
and
unmerciful
god
december
what
blasphemies
are
these
which
i
have
uttered
in
my
despair
horrible
madness
that
has
left
me
prostrate
to
what
heights
of
frenzy
didst
thou
not
drive
my
soul
like
him
of
old
time
who
wandered
among
the
tombs
shrieking
and
tearing
himself
i
have
been
possessed
by
a
devil
for
a
week
i
have
been
unconscious
of
aught
save
torture
i
have
gone
about
my
daily
duties
as
one
who
in
his
dreams
repeats
the
accustomed
action
of
the
day
and
knows
it
not
men
have
looked
at
me
strangely
they
look
at
me
strangely
now
can
it
be
that
my
disease
of
drunkenness
has
become
the
disease
of
insanity
am
i
mad
or
do
i
but
verge
on
madness
o
lord
whom
in
my
agonies
i
have
confessed
leave
me
my
intellect
let
me
not
become
a
drivelling
spectacle
for
the
curious
to
point
at
or
to
pity
at

in
mercy
spare
me
a
little
let
not
my
punishment
overtake
me
here
let
her
memories
of
me
be
clouded
with
a
sense
of
my
rudeness
or
my
brutality

me
for
ever
seem
to
her
the
ungrateful
ruffian
i
strive

show
myself

that
chapter
xii
the
strange
behaviour
of
north
on
or
about
the
of
december
frere
noticed
a
sudden
and
unaccountable
change
in
the
manner
of
the
chaplain
he
came
to
her
one
afternoon
and
after
talking
for
some
time
in
a
vague
and
unconnected
manner
about
the
miseries
of
the
prison
and
the
wretched
condition
of
some
of
the
prisoners
began
to
question
her
abruptly
concerning
rufus
dawes
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
him
said
she
with
a
shudder
i
have
the
strangest
the
most
horrible
dreams
about
him
he
is
a
bad
man
he
tried
to
murder
me
when
a
child
and
had
it
not
been
for
my
husband
he
would
have
done
so
i
have
only
seen
him
once
since
then
at
hobart
town
when
he
was
he
sometimes
speaks
to
me
of
you
said
north
eyeing
her
he
asked
me
once
to
give
him
a
rose
plucked
in
your
sylvia
turned
pale
and
you
gave
it
him
yes
i
gave
it
him
why
not
it
was
valueless
of
course
but
still
to
a
convict
you
are
not
angry
oh
no
why
should
i
be
angry
she
laughed
constrainedly
it
was
a
strange
fancy
for
the
man
to
have
that
i
suppose
you
would
not
give
me
another
rose
if
i
asked
why
not
said
she
turning
away
uneasily
you
you
are
a
not
i
you
do
know
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
you
had
never
seen
mr
north
terrified
at
the
wild
gleam
in
his
eyes
she
had
risen
hastily
you
are
talking
very
oh
do
be
alarmed
madam
i
am
not
drunk
he
pronounced
the
word
with
a
fierce
energy
i
had
better
leave
you
indeed
i
think
the
less
we
see
of
each
other
the
deeply
wounded
and
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
outburst
sylvia
allowed
him
to
stride
away
without
a
word
she
saw
him
pass
through
the
garden
and
slam
the
little
gate
but
she
did
not
see
the
agony
on
his
face
or
the
passionate
gesture
with
which
when
out
of
eyeshot
he
lamented
the
voluntary
abasement
of
himself
before
her
she
thought
over
his
conduct
with
growing
fear
it
was
not
possible
that
he
was
intoxicated
such
a
vice
was
the
last
one
of
which
she
could
have
believed
him
guilty
it
was
more
probable
that
some
effects
of
the
fever
which
had
recently
confined
him
to
his
house
yet
lingered
so
she
thought
and
thinking
was
alarmed
to
realize
of
how
much
importance
the
of
this
man
was
to
her
the
next
day
he
met
her
and
bowing
passed
swiftly
this
pained
her
could
she
have
offended
him
by
some
unlucky
word
she
made
maurice
ask
him
to
dinner
and
to
her
astonishment
he
pleaded
illness
as
an
excuse
for
not
coming
her
pride
was
hurt
and
she
sent
him
back
his
books
and
music
a
curiosity
that
was
unworthy
of
her
compelled
her
to
ask
the
servant
who
carried
the
parcel
what
the
clergyman
had
said
he
said
nothing
only
laughed
in
scorn
of
her
foolishness
his
conduct
was
ungentlemanly
and
intemperate
she
would
forget
as
speedily
as
possible
that
such
a
being
had
ever
existed
this
resolution
taken
she
was
unusually
patient
with
her
husband
so
a
week
passed
and
north
did
not
return
unluckily
for
the
poor
wretch
the
very
he
had
made
brought
about
the
precise
condition
of
things
which
he
was
desirous
to
avoid
it
is
possible
that
had
the
acquaintance
between
them
continued
on
the
same
staid
footing
it
would
have
followed
the
lot
of
most
acquaintanceships
of
the
kind
other
circumstances
and
other
scenes
might
have
wiped
out
the
memory
of
all
but
common
civilities
between
them
and
sylvia
might
never
have
discovered
that
she
had
for
the
chaplain
any
other
feeling
but
that
of
esteem
but
the
very
fact
of
the
sudden
wrenching
away
of
her
showed
her
how
barren
was
the
solitary
life
to
which
she
had
been
fated
her
husband
she
had
long
ago
admitted
with
bitter
was
utterly
unsuited
to
her
she
could
find
in
his
society
no
enjoyment
and
for
the
sympathy
which
she
needed
was
compelled
to
turn
elsewhere
she
understood
that
his
love
for
her
had
burnt
itself
out
she
confessed
with
intensity
of
that
his
apparent
affection
had
been
born
of
sensuality
and
had
perished
in
the
fires
it
had
itself
kindled
many
women
have
unhappily
made
some
such
discovery
as
this
but
for
most
women
there
is
some
distracting
occupation
had
it
been
sylvia
fate
to
live
in
the
midst
of
fashion
and
society
she
would
have
found
relief
in
the
conversation
of
the
witty
or
the
homage
of
the
distinguished
had
fortune
cast
her
lot
in
a
city
frere
might
have
become
one
of
those
charming
women
who
collect
around
their
whatever
of
male
intellect
is
obtainable
and
who
find
the
husband
admirably
useful
to
open
his
own
champagne
bottles
the
celebrated
women
who
have
stepped
out
of
their
domestic
circles
to
enchant
or
astonish
the
world
have
almost
invariably
been
cursed
with
unhappy
homes
but
poor
sylvia
was
not
destined
to
this
fortune
cast
back
upon
herself
she
found
no
surcease
of
pain
in
her
own
imaginings
and
meeting
with
a
man
sufficiently
her
elder
to
encourage
her
to
talk
and
sufficiently
clever
to
induce
her
to
seek
his
society
and
his
advice
she
learnt
for
the
first
time
to
forget
her
own
griefs
for
the
first
time
she
suffered
her
nature
to
expand
under
the
sun
of
a
congenial
influence
this
sun
suddenly
withdrawn
her
soul
grown
accustomed
to
the
warmth
and
light
shivered
at
the
gloom
and
she
looked
about
her
in
dismay
at
the
dull
and
barren
prospect
of
life
which
lay
before
her
in
a
word
she
found
that
the
society
of
north
had
become
so
far
necessary
to
her
that
to
be
deprived
of
it
was
a
grief
notwithstanding
that
her
husband
remained
to
console
her
after
a
week
of
such
reflections
the
barrenness
of
life
grew
insupportable
to
her
and
one
day
she
came
to
maurice
and
begged
to
be
sent
back
to
hobart
town
i
can
not
live
in
this
horrible
island
she
said
i
am
getting
let
me
go
to
my
father
for
a
few
months
maurice
consented
his
wife
was
looking
ill
and
major
vickers
was
an
old
man
a
rich
old
man
who
loved
his
only
daughter
it
was
not
undesirable
that
frere
should
visit
her
father
indeed
so
little
sympathy
was
there
between
the
pair
that
the
first
astonishment
over
maurice
felt
rather
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
for
a
while
you
can
go
back
in
the
lady
franklin
if
you
like
my
dear
he
said
i
expect
her
every
at
this
decision
much
to
his
surprise
she
kissed
him
with
more
show
of
affection
than
she
had
manifested
since
the
death
of
her
child
the
news
of
the
approaching
departure
became
known
but
still
north
did
not
make
his
appearance
had
it
not
been
a
step
beneath
the
dignity
of
a
woman
frere
would
have
gone
herself
and
asked
him
the
meaning
of
his
unaccountable
rudeness
but
there
was
just
sufficient
morbidity
in
the
sympathy
she
had
for
him
to
restrain
her
from
an
act
which
a
young
girl
though
not
more
innocent
would
have
dared
without
hesitation
calling
one
day
upon
the
wife
of
the
surgeon
however
she
met
the
chaplain
face
to
face
and
with
the
consummate
art
of
acting
which
most
women
possess
rallied
him
upon
his
absence
from
her
house
the
behaviour
of
the
poor
devil
thus
stabbed
to
the
heart
was
curious
he
forgot
gentlemanly
behaviour
and
the
respect
due
to
a
woman
flung
one
despairingly
angry
glance
at
her
and
abruptly
retired
sylvia
flushed
crimson
and
endeavoured
to
excuse
north
on
account
of
his
recent
illness
the
surgeon
wife
looked
askance
and
turned
the
conversation
the
next
time
sylvia
bowed
to
this
lady
she
got
a
chilling
salute
in
return
that
made
her
blood
boil
i
wonder
how
i
have
offended
field
she
asked
maurice
she
almost
cut
me
oh
the
old
cat
returned
maurice
what
does
it
matter
if
she
did
however
a
few
days
afterwards
it
seemed
that
it
did
matter
for
maurice
called
upon
field
and
conversed
seriously
with
him
the
issue
of
the
conversation
being
reported
to
frere
the
lady
wept
indignant
tears
of
wounded
pride
and
shame
it
appeared
that
north
had
watched
her
out
of
the
house
returned
and
related
in
a
stumbling
hesitating
way
field
said
how
he
disliked
frere
how
he
did
not
want
to
visit
her
and
how
flighty
and
reprehensible
such
conduct
was
in
a
married
woman
of
her
rank
and
station
this
act
of
baseness
or
profound
nobleness
achieved
its
purpose
sylvia
noticed
the
unhappy
priest
no
more
between
the
commandant
and
the
chaplain
now
arose
a
coolness
and
frere
set
himself
by
various
petty
tyrannies
to
disgust
north
and
compel
him
to
a
resignation
of
his
office
the
speedily
marked
the
difference
in
the
treatment
of
the
chaplain
and
their
demeanour
changed
for
respect
was
substituted
insolence
for
alacrity
sullenness
for
prompt
obedience
impertinent
intrusion
the
men
whom
north
favoured
were
selected
as
special
subjects
for
harshness
and
for
a
prisoner
to
be
seen
talking
to
the
clergyman
was
sufficient
to
ensure
for
him
a
series
of
tyrannies
the
result
of
this
was
that
north
saw
the
souls
he
laboured
to
save
slipping
back
into
the
gulf
beheld
the
men
he
had
half
won
to
love
him
meet
him
with
averted
faces
discovered
that
to
show
interest
in
a
prisoner
was
to
injure
him
not
to
serve
him
the
unhappy
man
grew
thinner
and
paler
under
this
ingenious
torment
he
had
deprived
himself
of
that
love
which
guilty
though
it
might
be
was
nevertheless
the
only
true
love
he
had
known
and
he
found
that
having
won
this
victory
he
had
gained
the
hatred
of
all
living
creatures
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
the
authority
of
the
commandant
was
so
supreme
that
men
lived
but
by
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
to
offend
him
was
to
perish
and
the
man
whom
the
commandant
hated
must
be
hated
also
by
all
those
who
wished
to
exist
in
peace
there
was
but
one
being
who
was
not
to
be
turned
from
his
allegiance
the
convict
murderer
rufus
dawes
who
awaited
death
for
many
days
he
had
remained
mute
broken
down
beneath
his
weight
of
sorrow
or
of
sullenness
but
north
bereft
of
other
love
and
sympathy
strove
with
that
fighting
soul
if
haply
he
might
win
it
back
to
peace
it
seemed
to
the
fancy
of
the
priest
a
fancy
distempered
perhaps
by
excess
or
superhumanly
exalted
by
mental
agony
that
this
convict
over
whom
he
had
wept
was
given
to
him
as
a
hostage
for
his
own
salvation
i
must
save
him
or
perish
he
said
i
must
save
him
though
i
redeem
him
with
my
own
frere
unable
to
comprehend
the
reason
of
the
calmness
with
which
the
doomed
felon
met
his
taunts
and
torments
thought
that
he
was
shamming
piety
to
gain
some
indulgence
of
meat
and
drink
and
redoubled
his
severity
he
ordered
dawes
to
be
taken
out
to
work
just
before
the
hour
at
which
the
chaplain
was
accustomed
to
visit
him
he
pretended
that
the
man
was
dangerous
and
directed
a
gaoler
to
be
present
at
all
interviews
lest
the
chaplain
might
be
murdered
he
issued
an
order
that
all
civil
officers
should
obey
the
challenges
of
convicts
acting
as
watchmen
and
north
coming
to
pray
with
his
penitent
would
be
stopped
ten
times
by
grinning
felons
who
putting
their
faces
within
a
foot
of
his
would
roar
out
who
goes
there
and
burst
out
laughing
at
the
reply
under
pretence
of
watching
more
carefully
over
the
property
of
the
chaplain
he
directed
that
any
convict
acting
as
constable
might
at
any
time
search
everywhere
and
anywhere
for
property
supposed
to
be
in
the
possession
of
a
prisoner
the
chaplain
servant
was
a
prisoner
of
course
and
north
drawers
were
ransacked
twice
in
one
week
by
troke
north
met
these
impertinences
with
unruffled
brow
and
frere
could
in
no
way
account
for
his
obstinacy
until
the
arrival
of
the
lady
franklin
explained
the
chaplain
apparent
coolness
he
had
sent
in
his
resignation
two
months
before
and
the
saintly
meekin
had
been
appointed
in
his
stead
frere
unable
to
attack
the
clergyman
and
indignant
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
defeated
revenged
himself
upon
rufus
dawes
chapter
xiii
north
speaks
the
method
and
manner
of
frere
revenge
became
a
subject
of
whispered
conversation
on
the
island
it
was
reported
that
north
had
been
forbidden
to
visit
the
convict
but
that
he
had
refused
to
accept
the
prohibition
and
by
a
threat
of
what
he
would
do
when
the
returning
vessel
had
landed
him
in
hobart
town
had
compelled
the
commandant
to
withdraw
his
order
the
commandant
however
speedily
discovered
in
rufus
dawes
signs
of
insubordination
and
set
to
work
again
to
reduce
still
further
the
spirit
he
had
so
ingeniously
broken
the
unhappy
convict
was
deprived
of
food
was
kept
awake
at
nights
was
put
to
the
hardest
labour
was
loaded
with
the
heaviest
irons
troke
with
devilish
malice
suggested
that
if
the
tortured
wretch
would
decline
to
see
the
chaplain
some
amelioration
of
his
condition
might
be
effected
but
his
suggestions
were
in
vain
fully
believing
that
his
death
was
certain
dawes
clung
to
north
as
the
saviour
of
his
agonized
soul
and
rejected
all
such
insidious
overtures
enraged
at
this
obstinacy
frere
sentenced
his
victim
to
the
spread
eagle
and
the
stretcher
now
the
rumour
of
the
obduracy
of
this
undaunted
convict
who
had
been
recalled
to
her
by
the
clergyman
at
their
strange
interview
had
reached
sylvia
ears
she
had
heard
gloomy
hints
of
the
punishments
inflicted
on
him
by
her
husband
order
and
as
constantly
revolving
in
her
mind
was
that
last
conversation
with
the
chaplain
she
wondered
at
the
prisoner
strange
fancy
for
a
flower
her
brain
began
to
thrill
with
those
undefined
and
dreadful
memories
which
had
haunted
her
childhood
what
was
the
link
between
her
and
this
murderous
villain
how
came
it
that
she
felt
at
times
so
strange
a
sympathy
for
his
fate
and
that
he
who
had
attempted
her
life
cherished
so
tender
a
remembrance
of
her
as
to
beg
for
a
flower
which
her
hand
had
touched
she
questioned
her
husband
concerning
the
convict
misdoings
but
with
the
petulant
brutality
which
he
invariably
displayed
when
the
name
of
rufus
dawes
intruded
itself
into
their
conversation
maurice
frere
harshly
refused
to
satisfy
her
this
but
raised
her
curiosity
higher
she
reflected
how
bitter
he
had
always
seemed
against
this
man
she
remembered
how
in
the
garden
at
hobart
town
the
hunted
wretch
had
caught
her
dress
with
words
of
assured
confidence
she
recollected
the
fragment
of
cloth
he
passionately
flung
from
him
and
which
her
affianced
lover
had
contemptuously
tossed
into
the
stream
the
name
of
dawes
detested
as
it
had
become
to
her
bore
yet
some
strange
association
of
comfort
and
hope
what
secret
lurked
behind
the
twilight
that
had
fallen
upon
her
childish
memories
deprived
of
the
advice
of
north
to
whom
a
few
weeks
back
she
would
have
confided
her
misgivings
she
resolved
upon
a
project
that
for
her
was
most
distasteful
she
would
herself
visit
the
gaol
and
judge
how
far
the
rumours
of
her
husband
cruelty
were
worthy
of
credit
one
sultry
afternoon
when
the
commandant
had
gone
on
a
visit
of
inspection
troke
lounging
at
the
door
of
the
new
prison
beheld
with
surprise
the
figure
of
the
commandant
lady
what
is
it
mam
he
asked
scarcely
able
to
believe
his
eyes
i
want
to
see
the
prisoner
troke
jaw
fell
see
dawes
he
repeated
yes
where
is
he
troke
was
preparing
a
lie
the
imperious
voice
and
the
clear
steady
gaze
confused
him
he
let
me
see
he
he
under
punishment
what
do
you
mean
are
they
flogging
him
no
but
he
dangerous
mam
the
commandant
do
you
mean
to
open
the
door
or
not
troke
troke
grew
more
confused
it
was
evident
that
he
was
most
unwilling
to
open
the
door
the
commandant
has
given
strict
orders
do
you
wish
me
to
complain
to
the
commandant
cries
sylvia
with
a
touch
of
her
old
spirit
and
jumped
hastily
at
the
conclusion
that
the
gaolers
were
perhaps
torturing
the
convict
for
their
own
entertainment
open
the
door
at
once
at
once
thus
commanded
troke
with
a
hasty
growl
of
its
being
no
affair
of
his
and
he
hoped
frere
would
tell
the
captain
how
it
happened
flung
open
the
door
of
a
cell
on
the
right
hand
of
the
doorway
it
was
so
dark
that
at
first
sylvia
could
distinguish
nothing
but
the
outline
of
a
framework
with
something
stretched
upon
it
that
resembled
a
human
body
her
first
thought
was
that
the
man
was
dead
but
this
was
not
so
he
groaned
her
eyes
accustoming
themselves
to
the
gloom
began
to
see
what
the
punishment
was
upon
the
floor
was
placed
an
iron
frame
about
six
feet
long
and
two
and
a
half
feet
wide
with
round
iron
bars
placed
transversely
about
twelve
inches
apart
the
man
she
came
to
seek
was
bound
in
a
horizontal
position
upon
this
frame
with
his
neck
projecting
over
the
end
of
it
if
he
allowed
his
head
to
hang
the
blood
rushed
to
his
brain
and
suffocated
him
while
the
effort
to
keep
it
raised
strained
every
muscle
to
agony
pitch
his
face
was
purple
and
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
sylvia
uttered
a
cry
this
is
no
punishment
murder
who
ordered
this
the
commandant
said
troke
sullenly
i
do
believe
it
loose
him
i
dare
mam
said
troke
loose
him
i
say
hailey
you
sir
there
the
noise
had
brought
several
warders
to
the
spot
do
you
hear
me
do
you
know
who
i
am
loose
him
i
say
in
her
eagerness
and
compassion
she
was
on
her
knees
by
the
side
of
the
infernal
machine
plucking
at
the
ropes
with
her
delicate
fingers
wretches
you
have
cut
his
flesh
he
is
dying
help
you
have
killed
him
the
prisoner
in
fact
seeing
this
angel
of
mercy
stooping
over
him
and
hearing
close
to
him
the
tones
of
a
voice
that
for
seven
years
he
had
heard
but
in
his
dreams
had
fainted
troke
and
hailey
alarmed
by
her
vehemence
dragged
the
stretcher
out
into
the
light
and
hastily
cut
the
lashings
dawes
rolled
off
like
a
log
and
his
head
fell
against
frere
troke
roughly
pulled
him
aside
and
called
for
water
sylvia
trembling
with
sympathy
and
pale
with
passion
turned
upon
the
crew
how
long
has
he
been
like
this
an
hour
said
troke
a
lie
said
a
stern
voice
at
the
door
he
has
been
there
nine
hours
wretches
cried
sylvia
you
shall
hear
more
of
this
oh
oh
i
am
sick
she
felt
for
the
wall
i
i
north
watched
her
with
agony
on
his
face
but
did
not
move
i
faint
i
she
uttered
a
despairing
cry
that
was
not
without
a
touch
of
anger
mr
north
do
you
not
see
oh
take
me
home
take
me
home
and
she
would
have
fallen
across
the
body
of
the
tortured
prisoner
had
not
north
caught
her
in
his
arms
rufus
dawes
awaking
from
his
stupor
saw
in
the
midst
of
a
sunbeam
which
penetrated
a
window
in
the
corridor
the
woman
who
came
to
save
his
body
supported
by
the
priest
who
came
to
save
his
soul
and
staggering
to
his
knees
he
stretched
out
his
hands
with
a
hoarse
cry
perhaps
something
in
the
action
brought
back
to
the
dimmed
remembrance
of
the
commandant
wife
the
image
of
a
similar
figure
stretching
forth
its
hands
to
a
frightened
child
in
the
mysterious
time
she
started
and
pushing
back
her
hair
bent
a
wistful
terrified
gaze
upon
the
face
of
the
kneeling
man
as
though
she
would
fain
read
there
an
explanation
of
the
shadowy
memory
which
haunted
her
it
is
possible
that
she
would
have
spoken
but
north
thinking
the
excitement
had
produced
one
of
those
hysterical
crises
which
were
common
to
her
gently
drew
her
still
gazing
back
towards
the
gate
the
convict
arms
fell
and
an
undefinable
presentiment
of
evil
chilled
him
as
he
beheld
the
priest
emotion
pallid
in
his
cheeks
slowly
draw
the
fair
young
creature
from
out
the
sunlight
into
the
grim
shadow
of
the
heavy
archway
for
an
instant
the
gloom
swallowed
them
and
it
seemed
to
dawes
that
the
strange
wild
man
of
god
had
in
that
instant
become
a
man
of
evil
blighting
the
brightness
and
the
beauty
of
the
innocence
that
clung
to
him
for
an
instant
and
then
they
passed
out
of
the
prison
archway
into
the
free
air
of
heaven
and
the
sunlight
glowed
golden
on
their
faces
you
are
ill
said
north
you
will
faint
why
do
you
look
so
wildly
what
is
it
she
whispered
more
in
answer
to
her
own
thoughts
than
to
his
question
what
is
it
that
links
me
to
that
man
what
deed
what
terror
what
memory
i
tremble
with
crowding
thoughts
that
die
ere
they
can
whisper
to
me
oh
that
prison
look
up
we
are
in
the
she
passed
her
hand
across
her
brow
sighing
heavily
as
one
awaking
from
a
disturbed
slumber
shuddered
and
withdrew
her
arm
from
his
north
interpreted
the
action
correctly
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
pardon
me
you
can
not
walk
alone
you
will
fall
i
will
leave
you
at
the
in
truth
she
would
have
fallen
had
he
not
again
assisted
her
she
turned
upon
him
eyes
whose
reproachful
sorrow
had
almost
forced
him
to
a
confession
but
he
bowed
his
head
and
held
silence
they
reached
the
house
and
he
placed
her
tenderly
in
a
chair
now
you
are
safe
madam
i
will
leave
she
burst
into
tears
why
do
you
treat
me
thus
north
what
have
i
done
to
make
you
hate
me
hate
you
said
north
with
trembling
lips
oh
no
i
do
not
do
not
hate
you
i
am
rude
in
my
speech
abrupt
in
my
manner
you
must
forget
it
and
and
a
horse
feet
crashed
upon
the
gravel
and
an
instant
after
maurice
frere
burst
into
the
room
returning
from
the
cascades
he
had
met
troke
and
learned
the
release
of
the
prisoner
furious
at
this
usurpation
of
authority
by
his
wife
his
wounded
by
the
thought
that
she
had
witnessed
his
mean
revenge
upon
the
man
he
had
so
infamously
wronged
and
his
natural
brutality
enhanced
by
brandy
he
had
made
for
the
house
at
full
gallop
determined
to
assert
his
authority
blind
with
rage
he
saw
no
one
but
his
wife
what
the
devil
this
i
hear
you
have
been
meddling
in
my
business
you
release
prisoners
you
captain
frere
said
north
stepping
forward
to
assert
the
restraining
presence
of
a
stranger
frere
started
astonished
at
the
intrusion
of
the
chaplain
here
was
another
outrage
of
his
dignity
another
insult
to
his
supreme
authority
in
its
passion
his
gross
mind
leapt
to
the
worst
conclusion
you
here
too
what
do
you
want
here
with
my
wife
this
is
your
quarrel
is
it
his
eyes
glanced
wrathfully
from
one
to
the
other
and
he
strode
towards
north
you
infernal
hypocritical
lying
scoundrel
if
it
was
for
your
black
coat
i
maurice
cried
sylvia
in
an
agony
of
shame
and
terror
striving
to
place
a
restraining
hand
upon
his
arm
he
turned
upon
her
with
so
fiercely
infamous
a
curse
that
north
pale
with
righteous
rage
seemed
prompted
to
strike
the
burly
ruffian
to
the
earth
for
a
moment
the
two
men
faced
each
other
and
then
frere
muttering
threats
of
vengeance
against
each
and
all
convicts
gaolers
wife
and
priest
flung
the
suppliant
woman
violently
from
him
and
rushed
from
the
room
she
fell
heavily
against
the
wall
and
as
the
chaplain
raised
her
he
heard
the
of
the
departing
horse
oh
cried
sylvia
covering
her
face
with
trembling
hands
let
me
leave
this
place
north
enfolding
her
in
his
arms
strove
to
soothe
her
with
incoherent
words
of
comfort
dizzy
with
the
blow
she
had
received
she
clung
to
him
sobbing
twice
he
tried
to
tear
himself
away
but
had
he
loosed
his
hold
she
would
have
fallen
he
could
not
hold
her
bruised
suffering
and
in
tears
thus
against
his
heart
and
keep
silence
in
a
torrent
of
agonized
eloquence
the
story
of
his
love
burst
from
his
lips
why
should
you
be
thus
tortured
he
cried
heaven
never
willed
you
to
be
mated
to
that
boor
you
whose
life
should
be
all
sunshine
leave
him
leave
him
he
has
cast
you
off
we
have
both
suffered
let
us
leave
this
dreadful
place
this
isthmus
between
earth
and
hell
i
will
give
you
i
am
going
she
said
faintly
i
have
already
arranged
to
north
trembled
it
was
not
of
my
seeking
fate
has
willed
it
we
go
together
they
looked
at
each
other
she
felt
the
fever
of
his
blood
she
read
his
passion
in
his
eyes
she
comprehended
the
hatred
he
had
affected
for
her
and
deadly
pale
drew
back
the
cold
hand
he
held
go
she
murmured
if
you
love
me
leave
me
leave
me
do
not
see
me
or
speak
to
me
again
her
silence
added
the
words
she
could
not
utter
till
chapter
xiv
getting
ready
for
sea
maurice
frere
passion
had
spent
itself
in
that
last
act
of
violence
he
did
not
return
to
the
prison
as
he
promised
himself
but
turned
into
the
road
that
led
to
the
cascades
he
repented
him
of
his
suspicions
there
was
nothing
strange
in
the
presence
of
the
chaplain
sylvia
had
always
liked
the
man
and
an
apology
for
his
conduct
had
doubtless
removed
her
anger
to
make
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
was
the
act
of
an
idiot
it
was
natural
that
she
should
release
dawes
women
were
so
a
few
platitudes
anent
the
necessity
for
the
treatment
that
to
those
unaccustomed
to
the
desperate
wickedness
of
convicts
must
appear
harsh
would
have
served
his
turn
far
better
than
bluster
and
abuse
moreover
north
was
to
sail
in
the
lady
franklin
and
might
put
in
execution
his
threats
of
official
complaint
unless
he
was
carefully
dealt
with
to
put
dawes
again
to
the
torture
would
be
to
show
to
troke
and
his
friends
that
the
wife
had
acted
without
the
commandant
authority
and
that
must
not
be
shown
he
would
now
return
and
patch
up
a
peace
his
wife
would
sail
in
the
same
vessel
with
north
and
he
would
in
a
few
days
be
left
alone
on
the
island
to
pursue
his
discipline
unchecked
with
this
intent
he
returned
to
the
prison
and
gravely
informed
poor
troke
that
he
was
astonished
at
his
barbarity
mrs
frere
who
most
luckily
had
appointed
to
meet
me
this
evening
at
the
prison
tells
me
that
the
poor
devil
dawes
had
been
on
the
stretcher
since
seven
this
you
ordered
it
fust
thing
yer
honour
said
troke
yes
you
fool
but
i
did
order
you
to
keep
the
man
there
for
nine
hours
did
i
why
you
scoundrel
you
might
have
killed
him
troke
scratched
his
head
in
bewilderment
take
his
irons
off
and
put
him
in
a
separate
cell
in
the
old
gaol
if
a
man
is
a
murderer
that
is
no
reason
you
should
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
is
it
you
better
take
care
on
the
way
back
he
met
the
chaplain
who
seeing
him
made
for
a
in
curious
haste
halloo
roared
frere
hi
north
north
paused
and
the
commandant
made
at
him
abruptly
look
here
sir
i
was
rude
to
you
just
now
devilish
rude
most
ungentlemanly
of
me
i
must
north
bowed
without
speaking
and
tried
to
pass
you
must
excuse
my
violence
frere
went
on
i
and
i
did
like
my
wife
interfering
women
do
you
know
do
see
these
things
do
understand
these
north
again
bowed
why
d
n
it
how
savage
you
look
quite
ghastly
bigod
i
must
have
said
most
outrageous
things
forget
and
forgive
you
know
come
home
and
have
some
i
can
not
enter
your
house
again
sir
said
north
in
tones
more
agitated
than
the
occasion
would
seem
to
warrant
frere
shrugged
his
great
shoulders
with
a
clumsy
affectation
of
good
humour
and
held
out
his
hand
well
shake
hands
parson
you
have
to
take
care
of
frere
on
the
voyage
and
we
may
as
well
make
up
our
differences
before
you
start
shake
let
me
pass
sir
cried
north
with
heightened
colour
and
ignoring
the
proffered
hand
strode
savagely
on
you
a
d
d
fine
temper
for
a
parson
said
frere
to
himself
however
if
you
wo
you
wo
hang
me
if
i
ask
you
nor
when
he
reached
home
did
he
fare
better
in
his
efforts
at
reconciliation
with
his
wife
sylvia
met
him
with
the
icy
front
of
a
woman
whose
pride
has
been
wounded
too
deeply
for
tears
say
no
more
about
it
she
said
i
am
going
to
my
father
if
you
want
to
explain
your
conduct
explain
it
to
come
sylvia
he
urged
i
was
a
brute
i
know
forgive
it
is
useless
to
ask
me
she
said
i
can
not
i
have
forgiven
you
so
much
during
the
last
seven
he
attempted
to
embrace
her
but
she
withdrew
herself
loathingly
from
his
arms
he
swore
a
great
oath
at
her
and
too
obstinate
to
argue
farther
sulked
blunt
coming
in
about
some
ship
matters
the
pair
drank
rum
sylvia
went
to
her
room
and
occupied
herself
with
some
minor
details
of
it
is
wonderful
how
women
find
relief
from
thoughts
in
household
care
while
north
poor
fool
seeing
from
his
window
the
light
in
hers
sat
staring
at
it
alternately
cursing
and
praying
in
the
meantime
the
unconscious
cause
of
all
of
this
rufus
dawes
sat
in
his
new
cell
wondering
at
the
chance
which
had
procured
him
comfort
and
blessing
the
fair
hands
that
had
brought
it
to
him
he
doubted
not
but
that
sylvia
had
interceded
with
his
tormentor
and
by
gentle
pleading
brought
him
ease
god
bless
her
he
murmured
i
have
wronged
her
all
these
years
she
did
not
know
that
i
he
waited
anxiously
for
north
to
visit
him
that
he
might
have
his
belief
confirmed
i
will
get
him
to
thank
her
for
me
he
thought
but
north
did
not
come
for
two
whole
days
no
one
came
but
his
gaolers
and
gazing
from
his
prison
window
upon
the
sea
that
almost
washed
its
walls
he
saw
the
schooner
at
anchor
mocking
him
with
a
liberty
he
could
not
achieve
on
the
third
day
however
north
came
his
manner
was
constrained
and
abrupt
his
eyes
wandered
uneasily
and
he
seemed
burdened
with
thoughts
which
he
dared
not
utter
i
want
you
to
thank
her
for
me
north
said
dawes
thank
whom
mrs
the
unhappy
priest
shuddered
at
hearing
the
name
i
do
not
think
you
owe
any
thanks
to
her
your
irons
were
removed
by
the
commandant
but
by
her
persuasion
i
feel
sure
of
it
ah
i
was
wrong
to
think
she
had
forgotten
me
ask
her
for
her
forgiveness
said
north
recalling
the
scene
in
the
prison
what
have
you
done
to
need
her
forgiveness
i
doubted
her
said
rufus
dawes
i
thought
her
ungrateful
and
treacherous
i
thought
she
delivered
me
again
into
the
bondage
from
whence
i
had
escaped
i
thought
she
had
betrayed
me
betrayed
me
to
the
villain
whose
base
life
i
saved
for
her
sweet
what
do
you
mean
asked
north
you
never
spoke
to
me
of
no
i
had
vowed
to
bury
the
knowledge
of
it
in
my
own
breast
it
was
too
bitter
to
saved
his
life
ay
and
hers
i
made
the
boat
that
carried
her
to
freedom
i
held
her
in
my
arms
and
took
the
bread
from
my
own
lips
to
feed
her
she
can
not
know
this
said
north
in
an
undertone
she
has
forgotten
it
perhaps
for
she
was
but
a
child
but
you
will
remind
her
will
you
not
you
will
do
me
justice
in
her
eyes
before
i
die
you
will
get
her
forgiveness
for
me
north
could
not
explain
why
such
an
interview
as
the
convict
desired
was
impossible
and
so
he
promised
she
is
going
away
in
the
schooner
said
he
concealing
the
fact
of
his
own
departure
i
will
see
her
before
she
goes
and
tell
god
bless
you
sir
said
poor
dawes
now
pray
with
me
and
the
wretched
priest
mechanically
repeated
one
of
the
formulae
his
church
prescribes
the
next
day
he
told
his
penitent
that
frere
had
forgiven
him
this
was
a
lie
he
had
not
seen
her
but
what
should
a
lie
be
to
him
now
lies
were
needful
in
the
tortuous
path
he
had
undertaken
to
tread
yet
the
deceit
he
was
forced
to
practise
cost
him
many
a
pang
he
had
succumbed
to
his
passion
and
to
win
the
love
for
which
he
yearned
had
voluntarily
abandoned
truth
and
honour
but
standing
thus
alone
with
his
sin
he
despised
and
hated
himself
to
deaden
remorse
and
drown
reflection
he
had
recourse
to
brandy
and
though
the
fierce
excitement
of
his
hopes
and
fears
steeled
him
against
the
stupefying
action
of
the
liquor
he
was
rendered
by
it
incapable
of
calm
reflection
in
certain
nervous
conditions
our
mere
physical
powers
are
proof
against
the
action
of
alcohol
and
though
ten
times
more
drunk
than
the
toper
who
incoherently
stammering
reels
into
the
gutter
we
can
walk
erect
and
talk
with
fluency
indeed
in
this
artificial
exaltation
of
the
sensibilities
men
often
display
a
brilliant
wit
and
an
acuteness
of
comprehension
calculated
to
delight
their
friends
and
terrify
their
physicians
north
had
reached
this
condition
of
in
plain
terms
he
was
trembling
on
the
verge
of
madness
the
days
passed
swiftly
and
blunt
preparations
for
sea
were
completed
there
were
two
stern
cabins
in
the
schooner
one
of
which
was
appropriated
to
frere
while
the
other
was
set
apart
for
north
maurice
had
not
attempted
to
renew
his
overtures
of
friendship
and
the
chaplain
had
not
spoken
mindful
of
sylvia
last
words
he
had
resolved
not
to
meet
her
until
fairly
embarked
upon
the
voyage
which
he
intended
should
link
their
fortunes
together
on
the
morning
of
the
december
blunt
declared
himself
ready
to
set
sail
and
in
the
afternoon
the
two
passengers
came
on
board
rufus
dawes
gazing
from
his
window
upon
the
schooner
that
lay
outside
the
reef
thought
nothing
of
the
fact
that
after
the
commandant
boat
had
taken
away
the
commandant
wife
another
boat
should
put
off
with
the
chaplain
it
was
quite
natural
that
north
should
desire
to
bid
his
friends
farewell
and
through
the
hot
still
afternoon
he
watched
for
the
returning
boat
hoping
that
the
chaplain
would
bring
him
some
message
from
the
woman
whom
he
was
never
to
see
more
on
earth
the
hours
wore
on
however
and
no
breath
of
wind
ruffled
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
day
was
exceedingly
close
and
sultry
heavy
dun
clouds
hung
on
the
horizon
and
it
seemed
probable
that
unless
a
should
clear
the
air
before
night
the
calm
would
continue
blunt
however
with
a
true
sailor
obstinacy
in
regard
to
weather
swore
there
would
be
a
breeze
and
held
to
his
purpose
of
sailing
the
hot
afternoon
passed
away
in
a
sultry
sunset
and
it
was
not
until
the
shades
of
evening
had
begun
to
fall
that
rufus
dawes
distinguished
a
boat
detach
itself
from
the
sides
of
the
schooner
and
glide
through
the
oily
water
to
the
jetty
the
chaplain
was
returning
and
in
a
few
hours
perhaps
would
be
with
him
to
bring
him
the
message
of
comfort
for
which
his
soul
thirsted
he
stretched
out
his
unshackled
limbs
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
stretcher
fell
to
recalling
the
past
his
the
news
of
his
fortune
his
love
and
his
north
however
was
not
returning
to
bring
to
the
prisoner
a
message
of
comfort
but
he
was
returning
on
purpose
to
see
him
nevertheless
the
unhappy
man
torn
by
remorse
and
passion
had
resolved
upon
a
course
of
action
which
seemed
to
him
a
penance
for
his
crime
of
deceit
he
determined
to
confess
to
dawes
that
the
message
he
had
brought
was
wholly
fictitious
that
he
himself
loved
the
wife
of
the
commandant
and
that
with
her
he
was
about
to
leave
the
island
for
ever
i
am
no
hypocrite
he
thought
in
his
exaltation
if
i
choose
to
sin
i
will
sin
boldly
and
this
poor
wretch
who
looks
up
to
me
as
an
angel
shall
know
me
for
my
true
the
notion
of
thus
destroying
his
own
fame
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
whom
he
had
taught
to
love
him
was
pleasant
to
his
diseased
imagination
it
was
the
natural
outcome
of
the
morbid
condition
of
mind
into
which
he
had
drifted
and
he
provided
for
the
complete
execution
of
his
scheme
with
cunning
born
of
the
mischief
working
in
his
brain
it
was
desirable
that
the
fatal
stroke
should
be
dealt
at
the
last
possible
instant
that
he
should
suddenly
unveil
his
own
infamy
and
then
depart
never
to
be
seen
again
to
this
end
he
had
invented
an
excuse
for
returning
to
the
shore
at
the
latest
possible
moment
he
had
purposely
left
in
his
room
a
the
sort
of
article
one
is
likely
to
forget
in
the
hurry
of
departure
from
one
house
and
so
certain
to
remember
when
the
time
comes
to
finally
prepare
for
settling
in
another
he
had
ingeniously
extracted
from
blunt
the
fact
that
he
did
expect
a
wind
before
dark
but
wanted
all
and
aboard
and
then
just
as
darkness
fell
discovered
that
it
was
imperative
for
him
to
go
ashore
blunt
cursed
but
if
the
chaplain
insisted
upon
going
there
was
no
help
for
it
there
be
a
breeze
in
less
than
two
hours
said
he
you
plenty
of
time
but
if
you
not
back
before
the
first
puff
i
sail
without
you
as
sure
as
you
north
assured
him
of
his
punctuality
do
wait
for
me
captain
if
i
not
here
said
he
with
the
lightness
of
tone
which
men
use
to
mask
anxiety
i
take
him
at
his
word
blunt
said
the
commandant
who
was
affably
waiting
to
take
final
farewell
of
his
wife
give
way
there
men
he
shouted
to
the
crew
and
wait
at
the
jetty
if
north
misses
his
ship
through
your
laziness
you
pay
for
so
the
boat
set
off
north
laughing
uproariously
at
the
thought
of
being
late
frere
observed
with
some
astonishment
that
the
chaplain
wrapped
himself
in
a
boat
cloak
that
lay
in
the
stern
sheets
does
the
fellow
want
to
smother
himself
in
a
night
like
this
was
his
remark
the
truth
was
that
though
his
hands
and
head
were
burning
north
teeth
chattered
with
cold
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
why
when
landed
and
out
of
eyeshot
of
the
crew
he
produced
a
of
rum
and
eagerly
drank
the
spirit
gave
him
courage
for
the
ordeal
to
which
he
had
condemned
himself
and
with
steadied
step
he
reached
the
door
of
the
old
prison
to
his
surprise
gimblett
refused
him
admission
but
i
have
come
direct
from
the
commandant
said
north
got
any
order
sir
order
i
ca
let
you
in
your
reverence
said
gimblett
i
want
to
see
the
prisoner
dawes
i
have
a
special
message
for
him
i
have
come
ashore
on
i
am
very
sorry
sir
the
ship
will
sail
in
two
hours
man
and
i
shall
miss
her
said
north
indignant
at
being
frustrated
in
his
design
let
me
upon
my
honour
sir
i
dare
said
gimblett
who
was
not
without
his
good
points
you
know
what
authority
is
north
was
in
despair
but
a
bright
thought
struck
him
a
thought
that
in
his
soberer
moments
would
never
have
entered
his
head
he
would
buy
admission
he
produced
the
rum
flask
from
beneath
the
sheltering
cloak
come
do
talk
nonsense
to
me
gimblett
you
do
suppose
i
would
come
here
without
authority
here
take
a
pull
at
this
and
let
me
gimblett
features
relaxed
into
a
smile
well
sir
i
suppose
it
all
right
if
you
say
so
said
he
and
clutching
the
rum
bottle
with
one
hand
he
opened
the
door
of
dawes
cell
with
the
other
north
entered
and
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
the
prisoner
who
had
been
lying
apparently
asleep
upon
his
bed
leapt
up
and
made
as
though
to
catch
him
by
the
throat
rufus
dawes
had
dreamt
a
dream
alone
amid
the
gathering
glooms
his
fancy
had
recalled
the
past
and
had
peopled
it
with
memories
he
thought
that
he
was
once
more
upon
the
barren
strand
where
he
had
first
met
with
the
sweet
child
he
loved
he
lived
again
his
life
of
usefulness
and
honour
he
saw
himself
working
at
the
boat
embarking
and
putting
out
to
sea
the
fair
head
of
the
innocent
girl
was
again
pillowed
on
his
breast
her
young
lips
again
murmured
words
of
affection
in
his
greedy
ear
frere
was
beside
him
watching
him
as
he
had
watched
before
once
again
the
grey
sea
spread
around
him
barren
of
succour
once
again
in
the
wild
wet
morning
he
beheld
the
american
brig
bearing
down
upon
them
and
saw
the
bearded
faces
of
the
astonished
crew
he
saw
frere
take
the
child
in
his
arms
and
mount
upon
the
deck
he
heard
the
shout
of
delight
that
went
up
and
pressed
again
the
welcoming
hands
which
greeted
the
rescued
castaways
the
deck
was
crowded
all
the
folk
he
had
ever
known
were
there
he
saw
the
white
hair
and
stern
features
of
sir
richard
devine
and
beside
him
stood
wringing
her
thin
hands
his
weeping
mother
then
frere
strode
forward
and
after
him
john
rex
the
convict
who
roughly
elbowing
through
the
crowd
of
prisoners
and
gaolers
would
have
reached
the
spot
where
stood
sir
richard
devine
but
that
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
lord
bellasis
arose
and
thrust
him
back
how
the
hammers
clattered
in
the
shipbuilder
yard
was
it
a
coffin
they
were
making
not
for
sylvia
surely
not
for
her
the
air
grows
heavy
lurid
with
flame
and
black
with
smoke
the
hydaspes
is
on
fire
sylvia
clings
to
her
husband
base
wretch
would
you
shake
her
off
look
up
the
midnight
heaven
is
glittering
with
stars
above
the
smoke
the
air
breathes
delicately
one
step
another
fix
your
eyes
on
mine
so
to
my
heart
alas
she
turns
he
catches
at
her
dress
what
it
is
a
priest
a
priest
who
smiling
with
infernal
joy
would
drag
her
to
the
flaming
gulf
that
yawns
for
him
the
dreamer
leaps
at
the
wretch
throat
and
crying
villain
was
it
for
this
fate
i
saved
her
and
awakes
to
find
himself
struggling
with
the
monster
of
his
dream
the
idol
of
his
waking
senses
mr
north
paralysed
no
less
by
the
suddenness
of
the
attack
than
by
the
words
with
which
it
was
accompanied
let
fall
his
cloak
and
stood
trembling
before
the
prophetic
accusation
of
the
man
whose
curses
he
had
come
to
earn
i
was
dreaming
said
rufus
dawes
a
terrible
dream
but
it
has
passed
now
the
message
you
have
brought
me
a
message
have
you
not
why
what
ails
you
you
are
pale
your
knees
tremble
did
my
violence
north
recovered
himself
with
a
great
effort
it
is
nothing
let
us
talk
for
my
time
is
short
you
have
thought
me
a
good
man
one
blessed
of
god
one
consecrated
to
a
holy
service
a
man
honest
pure
and
truthful
i
have
returned
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
none
of
these
rufus
dawes
sat
staring
unable
to
comprehend
this
madness
i
told
you
that
the
woman
you
loved
for
you
do
love
her
sent
you
a
message
of
forgiveness
i
what
i
never
told
her
of
your
confession
i
never
mentioned
your
name
to
and
she
will
go
without
knowing
oh
north
what
have
you
done
wrecked
my
own
soul
cried
north
wildly
stung
by
the
reproachful
agony
of
the
tone
do
not
cling
to
me
my
task
is
done
you
will
hate
me
now
that
is
my
wish
i
merit
it
let
me
go
i
say
i
shall
be
too
too
late
for
what
he
looked
at
the
cloak
through
the
open
window
came
the
voices
of
the
men
in
the
boat
the
memory
of
the
rose
of
the
scene
in
the
prison
flashed
across
him
and
he
understood
it
all
great
heaven
you
go
together
let
me
go
repeated
north
in
a
hoarse
voice
rufus
dawes
stepped
between
him
and
the
door
no
madman
i
will
not
let
you
go
to
do
this
great
wrong
to
kill
this
innocent
young
soul
who
god
help
her
loves
you
north
confounded
at
this
sudden
reversal
of
their
position
towards
each
other
crouched
bewildered
against
the
wall
i
say
you
shall
not
go
you
shall
not
destroy
your
own
soul
and
hers
you
love
her
so
do
i
and
my
love
is
mightier
than
yours
for
it
shall
save
her
in
god
name
cried
the
unhappy
priest
striving
to
stop
his
ears
ay
in
god
name
in
the
name
of
that
god
whom
in
my
torments
i
had
forgotten
in
the
name
of
that
god
whom
you
taught
me
to
remember
that
god
who
sent
you
to
save
me
from
despair
gives
me
strength
to
save
you
in
my
turn
oh
north
my
teacher
my
friend
my
brother
by
the
sweet
hope
of
mercy
which
you
preached
to
me
be
merciful
to
this
erring
woman
north
lifted
agonized
eyes
but
i
love
her
love
her
do
you
hear
what
do
you
know
of
love
love
cried
rufus
dawes
his
pale
face
radiant
love
oh
it
is
you
who
do
not
know
it
love
is
the
sacrifice
of
self
the
death
of
all
desire
that
is
not
for
another
good
love
is
godlike
you
love
no
no
your
love
is
selfishness
and
will
end
in
shame
listen
i
will
tell
you
the
history
of
such
a
love
as
north
enthralled
by
the
other
overmastering
will
fell
back
trembling
i
will
tell
you
the
secret
of
my
life
the
reason
why
i
am
here
come
chapter
xv
the
discovery
the
house
in
clarges
street
was
duly
placed
at
the
disposal
of
richard
devine
who
was
installed
in
it
to
the
profound
astonishment
and
disgust
of
smithers
and
his
it
now
only
remained
that
the
lady
should
be
formally
recognized
by
lady
devine
the
rest
of
the
ingenious
programme
would
follow
as
a
matter
of
course
john
rex
was
well
aware
of
the
position
which
in
his
assumed
personality
he
occupied
in
society
he
knew
that
by
the
world
of
servants
of
waiters
of
those
to
whom
servants
and
waiters
could
babble
of
such
turfites
and
as
had
reason
to
inquire
concerning
domestic
affairs
no
opinion
could
be
expressed
save
that
married
somebody
i
hear
with
variations
to
the
same
effect
he
knew
well
that
the
really
great
world
the
society
whose
scandal
would
have
been
socially
injurious
had
long
ceased
to
trouble
itself
with
richard
devine
doings
in
any
particular
if
it
had
been
reported
that
the
leviathan
of
the
turf
had
married
his
washerwoman
society
would
only
have
intimated
that
it
was
just
what
might
have
been
expected
of
him
to
say
the
truth
however
richard
had
rather
hoped
that
disgusted
at
his
brutality
lady
devine
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
and
that
the
ordeal
of
presenting
his
wife
would
not
be
necessary
lady
devine
however
had
resolved
on
a
different
line
of
conduct
the
intelligence
concerning
richard
devine
threatened
proceedings
seemed
to
nerve
her
to
the
confession
of
the
dislike
which
had
been
long
growing
in
her
mind
seemed
even
to
aid
the
formation
of
those
doubts
the
shadows
of
which
had
now
and
then
cast
themselves
upon
her
belief
in
the
identity
of
the
man
who
called
himself
her
son
his
conduct
is
brutal
said
she
to
her
brother
i
can
not
understand
it
is
more
than
brutal
it
is
unnatural
returned
francis
wade
and
stole
a
look
at
her
moreover
he
is
married
cried
lady
devine
so
he
says
continued
the
other
producing
the
letter
sent
to
him
by
rex
at
sarah
dictation
he
writes
to
me
stating
that
his
wife
whom
he
married
last
year
abroad
has
come
to
england
and
wishes
us
to
receive
i
will
not
receive
her
cried
lady
devine
rising
and
pacing
down
the
path
but
that
would
be
a
declaration
of
war
said
poor
francis
twisting
an
italian
onyx
which
adorned
his
irresolute
hand
i
would
not
advise
lady
devine
stopped
suddenly
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
has
finally
made
a
difficult
and
resolution
richard
shall
not
sell
this
house
she
said
but
my
dear
ellinor
cried
her
brother
in
some
alarm
at
this
unwonted
decision
i
am
afraid
that
you
ca
prevent
if
he
is
the
man
he
says
he
is
i
can
returned
she
with
effort
francis
wade
gasped
if
he
is
the
man
it
is
true
i
have
sometimes
thought
oh
ellinor
can
it
be
that
we
have
been
deceived
she
came
to
him
and
leant
upon
him
for
support
as
she
had
leant
upon
her
son
in
the
garden
where
they
now
stood
nineteen
years
ago
i
do
not
know
i
am
afraid
to
think
but
between
richard
and
myself
is
a
secret
a
shameful
secret
frank
known
to
no
other
living
person
if
the
man
who
threatens
me
does
not
know
that
secret
he
is
not
my
son
if
he
does
know
it
well
in
heaven
name
what
then
he
knows
that
he
has
neither
part
nor
lot
in
the
fortune
of
the
man
who
was
my
ellinor
you
terrify
me
what
does
this
mean
i
will
tell
you
if
there
be
need
to
do
so
said
the
unhappy
lady
but
i
can
not
now
i
never
meant
to
speak
of
it
again
even
to
him
consider
that
it
is
hard
to
break
a
silence
of
nearly
twenty
years
write
to
this
man
and
tell
him
that
before
i
receive
his
wife
i
wish
to
see
him
alone
no
do
not
let
him
come
here
until
the
truth
be
known
i
will
go
to
it
was
with
some
trepidation
that
richard
sitting
with
his
wife
on
the
afternoon
of
the
may
awaited
the
arrival
of
his
mother
he
had
been
very
nervous
and
unstrung
for
some
days
past
and
the
prospect
of
the
coming
interview
was
for
some
reason
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
weighty
with
fears
what
does
she
want
to
come
alone
for
and
what
can
she
have
to
say
he
asked
himself
she
can
not
suspect
anything
after
all
these
years
surely
he
endeavoured
to
reason
with
himself
but
in
vain
the
knock
at
the
door
which
announced
the
arrival
of
his
pretended
mother
made
his
heart
jump
i
feel
deuced
shaky
sarah
he
said
let
have
a
nip
of
you
been
nipping
too
much
for
the
last
five
years
she
had
quite
schooled
her
tongue
to
the
new
name
your
is
the
result
of
i
oh
do
preach
i
am
not
in
the
humour
for
help
yourself
then
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
are
ready
with
your
story
the
brandy
revived
him
and
he
rose
with
affected
heartiness
my
dear
mother
allow
me
to
present
to
you
he
paused
for
there
was
that
in
lady
devine
face
which
confirmed
his
worst
fears
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
alone
she
said
ignoring
with
steady
eyes
the
woman
whom
she
had
ostensibly
come
to
see
john
rex
hesitated
but
sarah
saw
the
danger
and
hastened
to
confront
it
a
wife
should
be
a
husband
best
friend
madam
your
son
married
me
of
his
own
free
will
and
even
his
mother
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
which
it
is
not
my
duty
and
privilege
to
hear
i
am
not
a
girl
as
you
can
see
and
i
can
bear
whatever
news
you
lady
devine
bit
her
pale
lips
she
saw
at
once
that
the
woman
before
her
was
not
but
she
felt
also
that
she
was
a
woman
of
higher
mental
calibre
than
herself
prepared
as
she
was
for
the
worst
this
sudden
and
open
declaration
of
hostilities
frightened
her
as
sarah
had
calculated
she
began
to
realize
that
if
she
was
to
prove
equal
to
the
task
she
had
set
herself
she
must
not
waste
her
strength
in
skirmishing
steadily
refusing
to
look
at
richard
wife
she
addressed
herself
to
richard
my
brother
will
be
here
in
half
an
hour
she
said
as
though
the
mention
of
his
name
would
better
her
position
in
some
way
but
i
begged
him
to
allow
me
to
come
first
in
order
that
i
might
speak
to
you
well
said
john
rex
we
are
in
private
what
have
you
to
say
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
forbid
you
to
carry
out
the
plan
you
have
for
breaking
up
sir
richard
forbid
me
cried
rex
much
relieved
why
i
only
want
to
do
what
my
father
will
enables
me
to
your
father
will
enables
you
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
and
you
know
she
spoke
as
though
rehearsing
a
series
of
and
sarah
watched
her
with
growing
alarm
oh
nonsense
cries
john
rex
in
sheer
amazement
i
have
a
opinion
on
do
you
remember
what
took
place
at
hampstead
this
day
nineteen
years
ago
at
hampstead
said
rex
grown
suddenly
pale
this
day
nineteen
years
ago
no
what
do
you
mean
do
you
not
remember
she
continued
leaning
forward
eagerly
and
speaking
almost
fiercely
do
you
not
remember
the
reason
why
you
left
the
house
where
you
were
born
and
which
you
now
wish
to
sell
to
strangers
john
rex
stood
dumbfounded
the
blood
suffusing
his
temples
he
knew
that
among
the
secrets
of
the
man
whose
inheritance
he
had
stolen
was
one
which
he
had
never
gained
the
secret
of
that
sacrifice
to
which
lady
devine
had
once
referred
and
he
felt
that
this
secret
was
to
be
revealed
to
crush
him
now
sarah
trembling
also
but
more
with
rage
than
terror
swept
towards
lady
devine
speak
out
she
said
if
you
have
anything
to
say
of
what
do
you
accuse
my
husband
of
imposture
cried
lady
devine
all
her
outraged
maternity
nerving
her
to
abash
her
enemy
this
man
may
be
your
husband
but
he
is
not
my
son
now
that
the
worst
was
out
john
rex
choking
with
passion
felt
all
the
devil
within
him
rebelling
against
defeat
you
are
mad
he
said
you
have
recognized
me
for
three
years
and
now
because
i
want
to
claim
that
which
is
my
own
you
invent
this
lie
take
care
how
you
provoke
me
if
i
am
not
your
son
you
have
recognized
me
as
such
i
stand
upon
the
law
and
upon
my
lady
devine
turned
swiftly
and
with
both
hands
to
her
bosom
confronted
him
you
shall
have
your
rights
you
shall
have
what
the
law
allows
you
oh
how
blind
i
have
been
all
these
years
persist
in
your
infamous
imposture
call
yourself
richard
devine
still
and
i
will
tell
the
world
the
shameful
secret
which
my
son
died
to
hide
be
richard
devine
richard
devine
was
a
bastard
and
the
law
allows
him
nothing
there
was
no
doubting
the
truth
of
her
words
it
was
impossible
that
even
a
woman
whose
home
had
been
desecrated
as
hers
had
been
would
invent
a
lie
so
yet
john
rex
forced
himself
to
appear
to
doubt
and
his
dry
lips
asked
if
then
your
husband
was
not
the
father
of
your
son
who
was
my
cousin
armigell
esmè
wade
lord
bellasis
answered
lady
devine
john
rex
gasped
for
breath
his
hand
tugging
at
his
rent
away
the
linen
that
covered
his
choking
throat
the
whole
horizon
of
his
past
was
lit
up
by
a
lightning
flash
which
stunned
him
his
brain
already
enfeebled
by
excess
was
unable
to
withstand
this
last
shock
he
staggered
and
but
for
the
cabinet
against
which
he
leant
would
have
fallen
the
secret
thoughts
of
his
heart
rose
to
his
lips
and
were
uttered
unconsciously
lord
bellasis
he
was
my
father
also
and
i
killed
him
a
dreadful
silence
fell
and
then
lady
devine
stretching
out
her
hands
towards
the
murderer
with
a
sort
of
frightful
respect
said
in
a
whisper
in
which
horror
and
supplication
were
strangely
mingled
what
did
you
do
with
my
son
did
you
kill
him
also
but
john
rex
wagging
his
head
from
side
to
side
like
a
beast
in
the
shambles
that
has
received
a
mortal
stroke
made
no
reply
sarah
purfoy
awed
as
she
was
by
the
dramatic
force
of
the
situation
nevertheless
remembered
that
francis
wade
might
arrive
at
any
moment
and
saw
her
last
opportunity
for
safety
she
advanced
and
touched
the
mother
on
the
shoulder

son

alive

will
you
promise
not
to
hinder

leaving
this
house

sarah
purfoy
rose
over
the
enemy
who
had
defeated
her
and
said
in
level
deliberate
accents
they
call
him
rufus
dawes

is
a
convict
at
norfolk
island
transported
for
life

a
twinkling

and
strove
to
rally
him

john

while

hurried
into
the
bank
and
her
name
secured
her
an
interview
with
the
manager
at
once
that
a
rich
woman
said
one
of
the
clerks
to
his
friend
a
widow
too

tom
returned
the

and
presently
from
out
the
sacred
presence
came
another
clerk
with
a
request
for
a
draft
on
sydney
for
three
thousand
less
premium
and
bearing
a
cheque
signed
sarah

he
just
then
one
of

partners

out
of
his
private
room
with
a
telegram
in
his
hand
and
beckoned
the
sarah

about
to

for
another
office
when
the

came
hastily
back
just
the
thing

he
handed

slip

paper

said
sarah
with
a
bewitching
smile
and
swept
down
to
her
cab
again
john
rex
was
gnawing
his
nails
in
sullen
apathy
she
displayed
the
you
are
saved
by
the
time
francis
wade
gets
his
wits
together
and
his
sister
recovers
her
speech

cries
rex
angrily
looking
at
the
warrant
why
there
of
all
places
in
god
earth
sarah
surveyed
him
with
an
expression
of
contempt
because
your
scheme
has
failed
now
this
is
mine
you
have
deserted
me
once
you
will
do
so
again
in
any
other
country
you
are
a
murderer
a
villain
and
a
coward
but
you
suit
me
i
save
you
but
i
mean
to
keep
you
i
will
bring
you
to
australia
where
the
first
trooper
will
arrest
you
at
my
bidding
as
an
escaped
convict
if
you
do
like
to
come
stay
behind
i
do
care
i
am
rich
i
have
done
no
wrong
the
law
can
not
touch
me
do
you
agree
then
tell
the
man
to
drive
to
silver
in
cornhill
for
your
having
housed
him
at
last
all
gloomy
and
despondent
in
a
quiet
tavern
near
the
railway
station
she
tried
to
get
some
information
as
to
this
last
revealed
crime
how
came
you
to
kill
lord
bellasis
she
asked
him
quietly
i
had
found
out
from
my
mother
that
i
was
his
natural
son
and
one
day
riding
home
from
a
pigeon
match
i
told
him
so
he
taunted
me
and
i
struck
him
i
did
not
mean
to
kill
him
but
he
was
an
old
man
and
in
my
passion
i
struck
hard
as
he
fell
i
thought
i
saw
a
horseman
among
the
trees
and
i
galloped
off
my
began
then
for
the
same
night
i
was
arrested
at
the
but
i
thought
there
was
robbery
said
she
not
by
me
but
for
god
sake
talk
no
more
about
it
i
am
sick
my
brain
is
going
round
i
want
to
be
careful
please
lift
him
gently
said
carr
as
the
boat
ranged
alongside
the
dido
gaunt
and
grim
in
the
early
dawn
of
a
bleak
may
morning
what
the
matter
asked
the
officer
of
the
watch
perceiving
the
bustle
in
the
boat
gentleman
seems
to
have
had
a
stroke
said
a
boatman
it
was
so
there
was
no
fear
that
john
rex
would
escape
again
from
the
woman
he
had
deceived
the
infernal
genius
of
sarah
purfoy
had
saved
her
lover
at
last
but
saved
him
only
that
she
might
nurse
him
till
he
died
died
ignorant
even
of
her
tenderness
a
mere
animal
lacking
the
intellect
he
had
in
his
selfish
wickedness
abused
chapter
xvii
the
redemption
that
is
my
story
let
it
plead
with
you
to
turn
you
from
your
purpose
and
to
save
her
the
punishment
of
sin
falls
not
upon
the
sinner
only
a
deed
once
done
lives
in
its
consequence
for
ever
and
this
tragedy
of
shame
and
crime
to
which
my
felon
death
is
a
fitting
end
is
but
the
outcome
of
a
selfish
sin
like
yours
it
had
grown
dark
in
the
prison
and
as
he
ceased
speaking
rufus
dawes
felt
a
trembling
hand
seize
his
own
it
was
that
of
the
chaplain
let
me
hold
your
hand
sir
richard
devine
did
not
murder
your
father
he
was
murdered
by
a
horseman
who
riding
with
him
struck
him
and
merciful
god
how
do
you
know
this
because
i
saw
the
murder
committed
because
do
let
go
my
hand
i
robbed
the
you
in
my
youth
i
was
a
gambler
lord
bellasis
won
money
from
me
and
to
pay
him
i
forged
two
bills
of
exchange
unscrupulous
and
cruel
he
threatened
to
expose
me
if
i
did
not
give
him
double
the
sum
forgery
was
death
in
those
days
and
i
strained
every
nerve
to
buy
back
the
proofs
of
my
folly
i
succeeded
i
was
to
meet
lord
bellasis
near
his
own
house
at
hampstead
on
the
night
of
which
you
speak
to
pay
the
money
and
receive
the
bills
when
i
saw
him
fall
i
galloped
up
but
instead
of
pursuing
his
murderer
i
rifled
his
of
my
forgeries
i
was
afraid
to
give
evidence
at
the
trial
or
i
might
have
saved
ah
you
have
let
go
my
hand
god
forgive
you
said
rufus
dawes
and
then
was
silent
speak
cried
north
speak
or
you
will
make
me
mad
reproach
me
spurn
me
spit
upon
me
you
can
not
think
worse
of
me
than
i
do
but
the
other
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
did
not
answer
and
with
a
wild
gesture
north
staggered
out
of
the
cell
nearly
an
hour
had
passed
since
the
chaplain
had
placed
the
rum
flask
in
his
hand
and
gimblett
observed
with
astonishment
that
it
was
not
yet
empty
he
had
intended
in
the
first
instance
to
have
taken
but
one
sup
in
payment
of
his
courtesy
for
gimblett
was
conscious
of
his
own
weakness
in
the
matter
of
strong
waters
but
as
he
waited
and
waited
the
one
sup
became
two
and
two
three
and
at
length
more
than
half
the
contents
of
the
bottle
had
moistened
his
gullet
and
maddened
him
for
more
gimblett
was
in
a
quandary
if
he
did
finish
the
flask
he
would
be
oppressed
with
an
everlasting
regret
if
he
did
finish
it
he
would
be
drunk
and
to
be
drunk
on
duty
was
the
one
unpardonable
sin
he
looked
across
the
darkness
of
the
sea
to
where
the
rising
and
falling
light
marked
the
schooner
the
commandant
was
a
long
way
off
a
faint
breeze
which
had
according
to
blunt
prophecy
arisen
with
the
night
brought
up
to
him
the
voices
of
the
boat
crew
from
the
jetty
below
him
his
friend
jack
mannix
was
coxswain
of
her
he
would
give
jack
a
drink
leaving
the
gate
he
advanced
unsteadily
to
the
edge
of
the
embankment
and
putting
his
head
over
called
out
to
his
friend
the
breeze
however
which
was
momentarily
freshening
carried
his
voice
away
and
jack
mannix
hearing
nothing
continued
his
conversation
gimblett
was
just
drunk
enough
to
be
virtuously
indignant
at
this
incivility
and
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bank
swallowed
the
remainder
of
the
rum
at
a
draught
the
effect
upon
his
enforcedly
temperate
stomach
was
very
touching
he
made
one
feeble
attempt
to
get
upon
his
legs
cast
a
reproachful
glance
at
the
rum
bottle
essayed
to
drink
out
of
its
spirituous
emptiness
and
then
with
a
smile
of
reckless
contentment
cursed
the
island
and
all
its
contents
and
fell
asleep
north
coming
out
of
the
prison
did
not
notice
the
absence
of
the
gaoler
indeed
he
was
not
in
a
condition
to
notice
anything
without
his
cloak
with
staring
eyes
and
clenched
hands
he
rushed
through
the
gates
into
the
night
as
one
who
flies
headlong
from
some
fearful
vision
it
seemed
that
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
took
no
heed
of
his
steps
for
instead
of
taking
the
path
which
led
to
the
sea
he
kept
along
the
more
familiar
one
that
led
to
his
own
cottage
on
the
hill
this
man
a
convict
he
cried
he
is
a
hero
a
martyr
what
a
life
love
yes
that
is
love
indeed
oh
james
north
how
base
art
thou
in
the
eyes
of
god
beside
this
despised
outcast
and
so
muttering
tearing
his
grey
hair
and
beating
his
throbbing
temples
with
clenched
hands
he
reached
his
own
room
and
saw
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
and
candle
standing
on
the
table
as
he
had
left
them
they
brought
again
to
his
mind
the
recollection
of
the
task
that
was
before
him
he
lighted
the
candle
and
taking
the
bag
in
his
hand
cast
one
last
look
round
the
chamber
which
had
witnessed
his
futile
struggles
against
that
baser
part
of
himself
which
had
at
last
triumphed
it
was
so
fate
had
condemned
him
to
sin
and
he
must
now
fulfil
the
doom
he
might
once
have
averted
already
he
fancied
he
could
see
the
dim
speck
that
was
the
schooner
move
slowly
away
from
the
prison
shore
he
must
not
linger
they
would
be
waiting
for
him
at
the
jetty
as
he
turned
the
moonbeams
as
yet
unobscured
by
the
rapidly
gathering
clouds
flung
a
silver
streak
across
the
sea
and
across
that
streak
north
saw
a
boat
pass
was
his
distracted
brain
playing
him
false
in
the
stern
sat
wrapped
in
a
cloak
the
figure
of
a
man
a
fierce
gust
of
wind
drove
the
over
the
moon
and
the
boat
disappeared
as
though
swallowed
up
by
the
gathering
storm
north
staggered
back
as
the
truth
struck
him
he
remembered
how
he
had
said
i
will
redeem
him
with
my
own
blood
was
it
possible
that
a
just
heaven
had
thus
decided
to
allow
the
man
whom
a
coward
had
condemned
to
escape
and
to
punish
the
coward
who
remained
oh
this
man
deserved
freedom
he
was
honest
noble
truthful
how
different
from
himself
a
hateful
an
unchaste
priest
a
drunkard
the
in
which
the
saintly
face
of
meekin
was
soon
to
be
reflected
stood
upon
the
table
and
north
peering
into
it
with
one
hand
mechanically
thrust
into
the
bag
started
in
insane
rage
at
the
pale
face
and
bloodshot
eyes
he
saw
there
what
a
hateful
wretch
he
had
become
the
last
fatal
impulse
of
insanity
which
seeks
relief
from
its
own
hideous
self
came
upon
him
and
his
fingers
closed
convulsively
upon
the
object
they
had
been
seeking
it
is
better
so
he
muttered
addressing
with
fixed
eyes
his
own
detested
image
i
have
examined
you
long
enough
i
have
read
your
heart
and
written
out
your
secrets
you
are
but
a
shell
the
shell
that
holds
a
corrupted
and
sinful
heart
he
shall
live
you
shall
die
the
rapid
motion
of
his
arm
overturned
the
candle
and
all
was
dark
rufus
dawes
overpowered
by
the
revelation
so
suddenly
made
to
him
had
remained
for
a
few
moments
motionless
in
his
cell
expecting
to
hear
the
heavy
clang
of
the
outer
door
which
should
announce
to
him
the
departure
of
the
chaplain
but
he
did
not
hear
it
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
air
in
the
cell
had
grown
suddenly
cooler
he
went
to
the
door
and
looked
into
the
narrow
corridor
expecting
to
see
the
scowling
countenance
of
gimblett
to
his
astonishment
the
door
of
the
prison
was
wide
open
and
not
a
soul
in
sight
his
first
thought
was
of
north
had
the
story
he
had
told
coupled
with
the
entreaties
he
had
lavished
sufficed
to
turn
him
from
his
purpose
he
looked
around
the
night
was
falling
suddenly
the
wind
was
mounting
from
beyond
the
bar
came
the
hoarse
murmur
of
an
angry
sea
if
the
schooner
was
to
sail
that
night
she
had
best
get
out
into
deep
waters
where
was
the
chaplain
pray
heaven
the
delay
had
been
sufficient
and
they
had
sailed
without
him
yet
they
would
be
sure
to
meet
he
advanced
a
few
steps
nearer
and
looked
about
him
was
it
possible
that
in
his
madness
the
chaplain
had
been
about
to
commit
some
violence
which
had
drawn
the
trusty
gimblett
from
his
post
ouph
the
trusty
gimblett
was
lying
at
his
feet
dead
drunk
hi
hiho
hillo
there
roared
somebody
from
the
jetty
below
be
that
you
muster
noarth
we
ai
too
much
tiam
sur
from
the
uncurtained
windows
of
the
chaplain
house
on
the
hill
beamed
the
candle
they
in
the
boat
did
not
see
it
but
it
brought
to
the
prisoner
a
wild
hope
that
made
his
heart

he
ran
back
to
the
cell
clapped
on
north
and
flinging
the
cloak
hastily
about
him
came
quickly
down
the
steps
if
the
moon
should
shine
out
now
jump
in
sir
said
unsuspecting
mannix
thinking
only
of
the
flogging
he
had
been
threatened
with
it
be
a
dirty
night
this
night
put
this
over
your
knees
sir
shove
her
off
give
way
and
they
were
afloat
but
one
glimpse
of
moonlight
fell
upon
the
slouched
hat
and
cloaked
figure
and
the
boat
crew
engaged
in
the
dangerous
task
of
navigating
the
reef
in
the
teeth
of
the
rising
gale
paid
no
attention
to
the

by
george
lads
we
but
just
in
time
cried
mannix
and
they
laid
alongside
the
schooner
black
in
blackness
up
ye
go
yer
honour
quick
the
wind
had
shifted
and
was
now
off
the
shore
blunt
who
had
begun
to
repent
of
his
obstinacy
but
would
not
confess
it
thought
the
next
best
thing
to
riding
out
the
gale
was
to
get
out
to
open
sea
damn
the
parson
he
had
said
in
all
heartiness
we
ca
wait
all
night
for
him
heave
ahead

and
so
the
anchor
was
atrip
as
rufus
dawes
ran
up
the
side
the
commandant
already
pulling
off
in
his
own
boat
roared
a
coarse
farewell
north
it
was
touch
and
go
with
ye
adding
curse
the
fellow
he
too
proud
to
answer
the
chaplain
indeed
spoke
to
no
one
and
plunging
down
the
hatchway
made
for
the
stern
cabins
close
shave
your
reverence
said
a
respectful
somebody
opening
a
door
it
was
but
the
clergyman
did
not
say
so
he
the
door
and
hardly
realizing
the
danger
he
had
escaped
flung
himself
on
the
bunk
panting
over
his
head
he
heard
the
rapid
tramp
of
feet
and
the
cheery
yo
and
a
rumbelow
of
the
men
at
the
capstan
he
could
smell
the
sea
and
through
the
open
window
of
the
cabin
could
distinguish
the
light
in
the
chaplain
house
on
the
hill
the
trampling
ceased
the
vessel
began
to
move
slowly
the
commandant
boat
appeared
below
him
for
an
instant
making
her
way
back
the
lady
franklin
had
set
sail
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
tiny
light
he
strove
to
think
what
was
best
to
be
done
it
was
hopeless
to
think
that
he
could
maintain
the
imposture
which
favoured
by
the
darkness
and
confusion
he
had
hitherto
successfully
attempted
he
was
certain
to
be
detected
at
hobart
town
even
if
he
could
lie
concealed
during
his
long
and
tedious
voyage
that
mattered
little
however
he
had
saved
sylvia
for
north
had
been
left
behind
poor
north
as
the
thought
of
pity
came
to
him
the
light
he
looked
at
was
suddenly
extinguished
and
rufus
dawes
compelled
thereto
as
by
an
irresistible
power
fell
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
for
the
pardon
and
happiness
of
the
man
who
had
redeemed
him

from

cried

with
a
tremendous
oath
we
have
else
to
do
look
there
the
sky
to
the
northward
was
streaked
with
a
belt
of
livid
green
colour
above
which
rose
a
mighty
black
cloud
whose
shape
was

changing

the
cyclone
blunt
recognising
the
meteoric
heralds
of
danger
had
begun
to
regret
his
obstinacy
he
saw
that
a
hurricane
was
approaching
along
the
south
coast
of
the
australian
continent
though
the
usual
westerly
winds
and
gales
of
the
highest
latitudes
prevail
during
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
hurricanes
are
not
infrequent
gales
commence
at

with
a
low
barometer
increasing
at
w
and

and
gradually
veering
to
the
south
true
cyclones
occur
at
new
zealand
the
log
of
the
adelaide
for
february
describes
one
which
travelled
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
and
had
all
the
veerings
calm
centre
of
a
true
tropical
hurricane
now
a
cyclone
occurring
off
the
west
coast
of
new
zealand
would
travel
from
the
new
hebrides
where
such
storms
are
hideously
frequent
and
envelop
norfolk
island
passing
directly
across
the
track
of
vessels
coming
from
south
america
to
sydney
it
was
one
of
these
rotatory
storms
an
escaped
tempest
of
the
tropics
which
threatened
the
lady
franklin
the
ominous
calm
which
had
brooded
over
the
island
during
the
day
had
given
place
to
a
smart
breeze
from
the
and
though
the
schooner
had
been
sheltered
at
her
anchorage
under
the
lee
of
the
island
the
harbour
looked
nearly
due
south
when
once
fairly
out
to
sea
blunt
saw
it
would
be
impossible
to
put
back
in
the
teeth
of
the
gale
haply
however
the
full
fury
of
the
storm
would
not
overtake
them
till
they
had
gained
rufus
dawes
exhausted
with
the
excitement
through
which
he
had
passed
had
slept
for
two
or
three
hours
when
he
was
awakened
by
the
motion
of
the
vessel
going
on
the
other
tack
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
found
himself
in
complete
darkness
overhead
was
the
noise
of
trampling
feet
and
he
could
distinguish
the
hoarse
tones
of
blunt
bellowing
orders
astonished
at
the
absence
of
the
moonlight
which
had
so
lately
silvered
the
sea
he
flung
open
the
cabin
window
and
looked
out
as
we
have
said
the
cabin
allotted
to
north
was
one
of
the
two
stern
cabins
and
from
it
the
convict
had
a
full
view
of
the
approaching
storm
the
sight
was
one
of
wild
grandeur
the
huge
black
cloud
which
hung
in
the
horizon
had
changed
its
shape
instead
of
a
curtain
it
was
an
arch
beneath
this
vast
and
magnificent
portal
shone
a
dull
phosphoric
light
across
this
livid
space
pale
flashes
of
passed
noiselessly
behind
it
was
a
dull
and
threatening
murmur
made
up
of
the
grumbling
of
thunder
the
falling
of
rain
and
the
roar
of
contending
wind
and
water
the
lights
of
the
had
disappeared
so
rapid
had
been
the
progress
of
the
schooner
under
the
steady
breeze
and
the
ocean
stretched
around
black
and
desolate
gazing
upon
this
gloomy
expanse
rufus
dawes
observed
a
strange
phenomenon
lightning
appeared
to
burst
upwards
from
the
sullen
bosom
of
the
sea
at
intervals
the
waves
flashed
fire
and
streaks
of
flame
shot
upwards
the
wind
increased
in
violence
and
the
arch
of
light
was
fringed
with
rain
a
dull
red
glow
hung
around
like
the
reflection
of
a
conflagration
suddenly
a
tremendous
peal
of
thunder
accompanied
by
a
terrific
downfall
of
rain
rattled
along
the
sky
the
arch
of
light
disappeared
as
though
some
invisible
hand
had
shut
the
slide
of
a
giant
lantern
a
great
wall
of
water
rushed
roaring
over
the
level
plain
of
the
sea
and
with
an
indescribable
medley
of
sounds
in
which
tones
of
horror
triumph
and
torture
were
blended
the
cyclone
swooped
upon
them
rufus
dawes
comprehended
that
the
elements
had
come
to
save
or
destroy
him
in
that
awful
instant
the
natural
powers
of
the
man
rose
equal
to
the
occasion
in
a
few
hours
his
fate
would
be
decided
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
take
all
precaution
one
of
two
events
seemed
inevitable
he
would
either
be
drowned
where
he
lay
or
should
the
vessel
weather
the
storm
he
would
be
forced
upon
the
deck
and
the
desperate
imposture
he
had
attempted
be
discovered
for
the
moment
despair
overwhelmed
him
and
he
contemplated
the
raging
sea
as
though
he
would
cast
himself
into
it
and
thus
end
his
troubles
the
tones
of
a
woman
voice
recalled
him
to
himself
cautiously
unlocking
the
cabin
door
he
peered
out
the
cuddy
was
lighted
by
a
swinging
lamp
which
revealed
sylvia
questioning
one
of
the
women
concerning
the
storm
as
rufus
dawes
looked
he
saw
her
glance
with
an
air
half
of
hope
half
of
fear
towards
the
door
behind
which
he
lurked
and
he
understood
that
she
expected
to
see
the
chaplain
locking
the
door
he
proceeded
hastily
to
dress
himself
in
north
clothes
he
would
wait
until
his
aid
was
absolutely
required
and
then
rush
out
in
the
darkness
sylvia
would
mistake
him
for
the
priest
he
could
convey
her
to
the
boat
if
recourse
to
the
boats
should
be
rendered
necessary
and
then
take
the
hazard
of
his
fortune
while
she
was
in
danger
his
place
was
near
by
from
the
deck
of
the
vessel
the
scene
was
appalling
the
clouds
had
closed
in
the
arch
of
light
had
disappeared
and
all
was
a
dull
windy
blackness
gigantic
seas
seemed
to
mount
in
the
horizon
and
sweep
towards
and
upon
them
it
was
as
though
the
ship
lay
in
the
vortex
of
a
whirlpool
so
high
on
either
side
of
her
were
piled
the
rough
pyramidical
masses
of
sea
mighty
gusts
arose
claps
of
wind
which
seemed
like
strokes
of
thunder
a
sail
loosened
from
its
tackling
was
torn
away
and
blown
out
to
sea
disappearing
like
a
shred
of
white
paper
to
leeward
the
mercury
in
the
barometer
marked
blunt
who
had
been
at
the
rum
bottle
swore
great
oaths
that
no
soul
on
board
would
see
another
sun
and
when
partridge
rebuked
him
for
blasphemy
at
such
a
moment
wept
spirituous
tears
the
howling
of
the
wind
was
benumbing
the
very
fury
of
sound
enfeebled
while
it
terrified
the
sailors
crawled
about
the
deck
clinging
to
anything
they
thought
most
secure
it
was
impossible
to
raise
the
head
to
look
to
windward
the
eyelids
were
driven
together
and
the
face
stung
by
the
swift
and
biting
spray
men
breathed
this
atmosphere
of
salt
and
wind
and
became
sickened
partridge
felt
that
orders
were
useless
the
man
at
his
elbow
could
not
have
heard
them
the
vessel
lay
almost
on
her
beam
ends
with
her
helm
up
stripped
even
of
the
sails
which
had
been
furled
upon
the
yards
mortal
hands
could
do
nothing
for
her
by
five
in
the
morning
the
gale
had
reached
its
height
the
heavens
showered
out
rain
and
lightnings
rain
which
the
wind
blew
away
before
it
reached
the
ocean
lightnings
which
the
ravenous
and
mountainous
waves
swallowed
before
they
could
pierce
the
gloom
the
ship
lay
over
on
her
side
held
there
by
the
madly
rushing
wind
which
seemed
to
flatten
down
the
sea
cutting
off
the
top
of
the
waves
and
breaking
them
into
fine
white
spray
which
covered
the
ocean
like
a
thick
cloud
as
high
as
the
topmast
heads
each
gust
seemed
unsurpassable
in
intensity
but
was
succeeded
after
a
pause
that
was
not
a
lull
but
a
gasp
by
one
of
more
frantic
violence
the
barometer
stood
at
the
ship
was
a
mere
labouring
crazy
wreck
that
might
sink
at
any
moment
at
three
the
barometer
had
fallen
to
save
when
lighted
by
occasional
flashes
of
which
showed
to
the
cowed
wretches
their
faces
this
tragedy
of
the
elements
was
performed
in
a
darkness
which
was
almost
palpable
suddenly
the
mercury
rose
to
and
with
one
awful
shriek
the
wind
dropped
to
a
calm
the
lady
franklin
had
reached
the
centre
of
the
cyclone
partridge
glancing
to
where
the
great
body
of
drunken
blunt
rolled
helplessly
lashed
to
the
wheel
felt
a
strange
selfish
joy
thrill
him
if
the
ship
survived
the
drunken
captain
would
be
dismissed
and
he
partridge
the
gallant
would
reign
in
his
stead
the
schooner
no
longer
steadied
by
the
wind
was
at
the
mercy
of
every
sea
volumes
of
water
poured
over
her
presently
she
heeled
over
for
with
a
triumphant
scream
the
wind
leapt
on
to
her
from
a
fresh
quarter
following
its
usual
course
the
storm
returned
upon
its
track
the
hurricane
was
about
to
repeat
itself
from
the
the
sea
pouring
down
through
the
burst
hatchway
tore
the
door
of
the
cuddy
from
its
hinges
sylvia
found
herself
surrounded
by
a
torrent
which
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
she
shrieked
aloud
for
aid
but
her
voice
was
inaudible
even
to
herself
clinging
to
the
mast
which
penetrated
the
little
cuddy
she
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
door
behind
which
she
imagined
north
was
and
whispered
a
last
prayer
for
succour
the
door
opened
and
from
out
the
cabin
came
a
figure
clad
in
black
she
looked
up
and
the
light
of
the
expiring
lamp
showed
her
a
face
that
was
not
that
of
the
man
she
hoped
to
see
then
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
beaming
ineffable
love
and
pity
were
bent
upon
her
and
a
pair
of
dripping
arms
held
her
above
the
brine
as
she
had
once
been
held
in
the
misty
mysterious
days
that
were
gone
in
the
terror
of
that
moment
the
cloud
which
had
so
long
oppressed
her
brain
passed
from
it
the
action
of
the
strange
man
before
her
completed
and
explained
the
action
of
the
convict
chained
to
the
port
arthur
of
the
convict
kneeling
in
the
norfolk
island
she
remembered
the
terrible
experience
of
macquarie
harbour
she
recalled
the
evening
of
the
when
swung
into
the
air
by
stalwart
arms
she
had
promised
the
rescuing
prisoner
to
plead
for
him
with
her
kindred
regaining
her
memory
thus
all
the
agony
and
shame
of
the
man
long
life
of
misery
became
at
once
apparent
to
her
she
understood
how
her
husband
had
deceived
her
and
with
what
base
injustice
and
falsehood
he
had
bought
her
young
love
no
question
as
to
how
this
prisoner
had
escaped
from
the
hideous
isle
of
punishment
she
had
quitted
occurred
to
her
she
asked
not
even
in
her
thoughts
how
it
had
been
given
to
him
to
supplant
the
chaplain
in
his
place
on
board
the
vessel
she
only
considered
in
her
sudden
awakening
the
story
of
his
wrongs
remembered
only
his
marvellous
fortitude
and
love
knew
only
in
this
last
instant
of
her
pure
life
that
as
he
had
saved
her
once
from
starvation
and
death
so
had
he
come
again
to
save
her
from
sin
and
from
despair
whoever
has
known
a
deadly
peril
will
remember
how
swiftly
thought
then
travelled
back
through
scenes
clean
forgotten
and
will
understand
how
sylvia
retrospective
vision
merged
the
past
into
the
actual
before
her
how
the
shock
of
recovered
memory
subsided
in
the
grateful
utterance
of
other
days
good
dawes
the
eyes
of
the
man
and
woman
met
in
one
long
wild
gaze
sylvia
stretched
out
her
white
hands
and
smiled
and
richard
devine
understood
in
his
turn
the
story
of
the
young
girl
joyless
life
and
knew
how
she
had
been
sacrificed
in
the
great
crisis
of
our
life
when
brought
face
to
face
with
annihilation
we
are
suspended
gasping
over
the
great
emptiness
of
death
we
become
conscious
that
the
self
which
we
think
we
knew
so
well
has
strange
and
capacities
to
describe
a
tempest
of
the
elements
is
not
easy
but
to
describe
a
tempest
of
the
soul
is
impossible
amid
the
fury
of
such
a
tempest
a
thousand
memories
each
bearing
in
its
breast
the
corpse
of
some
dead
deed
whose
influence
haunts
us
yet
are
driven
like
feathers
before
the
blast
as
unsubstantial
and
as
unregarded
the
mists
which
shroud
our
self
knowledge
become
transparent
and
we
are
smitten
with
sudden
comprehension
of
our
own
misused
power
over
our
fate
this
much
we
feel
and
know
but
who
can
coldly
describe
the
hurricane
which
thus
him
as
well
ask
the
drowned
mariner
to
tell
of
the
marvels
of
when
the
great
deeps
swallowed
him
and
the
darkness
of
death
encompassed
him
round
about
these
two
human
beings
felt
that
they
had
done
with
life
together
thus
alone
in
the
very
midst
and
presence
of
death
the
distinctions
of
the
world
they
were
about
to
leave
disappeared
then
vision
grew
clear
they
felt
as
beings
whose
bodies
had
already
perished
and
as
they
clasped
hands
their
freed
souls
recognizing
each
the
loveliness
of
the
other
rushed
tremblingly
together
borne
before
the
returning
whirlwind
an
immense
wave
which
glimmered
in
the
darkness
spouted
up
and
towered
above
the
wreck
the
wretches
who
yet
clung
to
the
deck
looked
shuddering
up
into
the
bellying
greenness
and
knew
that

fourth
epilogue
at
the
morning
after
the
storm
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
fell
upon
an
object
which
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
not
far
from
where
the
schooner
had
foundered
this
object
was
a
portion
of
the
mainmast
head
of
the
lady
franklin
and
entangled
in
the
rigging
were
two
corpses
a
man
and
a
woman
the
arms
of
the
man
were
clasped
round
the
body
of
the
woman
and
her
head
lay
on
his
breast
the
prison
island
appeared
but
as
a
long
low
line
on
the
distant
horizon
the
tempest
was
over
as
the
sun
rose
higher
the
air
grew
balmy
the
ocean
placid
and
golden
in
the
rays
of
the
new
risen
morning
the
wreck
and
its
burden
drifted
out
to
sea
