heinemann
colonial
library
of
popular
fiction
the
white
peacock
by
lawrence
a
book
of
real
distinction
both
of
style
and
thought
many
of
the
descriptive
passages
have
an
almost
lyrical
charm
and
the
characterisation
is
generally
speaking
deft
and
white
peacock
is
a
book
not
only
worth
reading
but
worth
reckoning
with
for
we
are
inclined
to
think
the
author
has
come
to
stay
morning
that
it
has
elements
of
greatness
few
will
deny
heinemann
is
once
again
to
be
congratulated
on
a

part

chapter
i
the
people
of
nethermere
i
stood
watching
the
shadowy
fish
slide
through
the
gloom
of
the
they
were
grey
descendants
of
the
silvery
things
that
had
darted
away
from
the
monks
in
the
young
days
when
the
valley
was
lusty
the
whole
place
was
gathered
in
the
musing
of
old
age
the
trees
on
the
far
shore
were
too
dark
and
sober
to
dally
with
the
sun
the
weeds
stood
crowded
and
motionless
not
even
a
little
wind
flickered
the
willows
of
the
islets
the
water
lay
softly
intensely
still
only
the
thin
stream
falling
through
the
murmured
to
itself
of
the
tumult
of
life
which
had
once
quickened
the
valley
i
was
almost
startled
into
the
water
from
my
perch
on
the
alder
roots
by
a
voice
saying
well
what
is
there
to
look
at
my
friend
was
a
young
farmer
stoutly
built
brown
eyed
with
a
naturally
fair
skin
burned
dark
and
freckled
in
patches
he
laughed
seeing
me
start
and
looked
down
at
me
with
lazy
curiosity
i
was
thinking
the
place
seemed
old
brooding
over
its
past
he
looked
at
me
with
a
lazy
indulgent
smile
and
lay
down
on
his
back
on
the
bank
saying
it
all
right
for
a
your
life
is
nothing
else
but
a
doss
i
shall
laugh
when
somebody
jerks
you
awake
i
replied
he
smiled
comfortably
and
put
his
hands
over
his
eyes
because
of
the
light
why
shall
you
laugh
he
drawled
because
you
be
amusing
said
i
we
were
silent
for
a
long
time
when
he
rolled
over
and
began
to
poke
with
his
finger
in
the
bank
i
thought
he
said
in
his
leisurely
fashion
there
was
some
cause
for
all
this
buzzing
i
looked
and
saw
that
he
had
poked
out
an
old
papery
nest
of
those
pretty
field
bees
which
seem
to
have
dipped
their
tails
into
bright
amber
dust
some
agitated
insects
ran
round
the
cluster
of
eggs
most
of
which
were
empty
now
the
crowns
gone
a
few
young
bees
staggered
about
in
uncertain
flight
before
they
could
gather
power
to
wing
away
in
a
strong
course
he
watched
the
little
ones
that
ran
in
and
out
among
the
shadows
of
the
grass
hither
and
thither
in
consternation
come
here
he
said
imprisoning
one
poor
little
bee
under
a
grass
stalk
while
with
another
stalk
he
loosened
the
folded
blue
wings
do
tease
the
little
beggar
i
said
it
does
hurt
wanted
to
see
if
it
was
because
he
spread
his
wings
that
he
could
fly
there
he
he
does
let
try
another
leave
them
alone
said
i
let
them
run
in
the
sun
they
only
just
out
of
the
shells
do
torment
them
into
flight
he
persisted
however
and
broke
the
wing
of
the
next
oh
said
he
and
he
crushed
the
little
thing
between
his
fingers
then
he
examined
the
eggs
and
pulled
out
some
silk
from
round
the
dead
larva
and
investigated
it
all
in
a
desultory
manner
asking
of
me
all
i
knew
about
the
insects
when
he
had
finished
he
flung
the
clustered
eggs
into
the
water
and
rose
pulling
out
his
watch
from
the
depth
of
his
breeches
pocket
i
thought
it
was
about
said
he
smiling
at
me
i
always
know
when
it
about
twelve
are
you
coming
in
i
coming
down
at
any
rate
said
i
as
we
passed
along
the
pond
bank
and
over
the
that
crossed
the
brow
of
the
falling
sluice
the
bankside
where
the
grey
orchard
twisted
its
trees
was
a
steep
declivity
long
and
sharp
dropping
down
to
the
garden
the
stones
of
the
large
house
were
burdened
with
ivy
and
and
the
great
that
had
once
guarded
the
porch
now
almost
blocked
the
doorway
we
passed
out
of
the
front
garden
into
the
and
walked
along
the
brick
path
to
the
back
door
shut
the
gate
will
you
he
said
to
me
over
his
shoulder
as
he
passed
on
first
we
went
through
the
large
scullery
into
the
kitchen
the
was
just
hurriedly
snatching
the
out
of
the
table
drawer
and
his
mother
a
quaint
little
woman
with
big
brown
eyes
was
hovering
round
the
wide
fireplace
with
a
fork
dinner
not
ready
said
he
with
a
shade
of
resentment
no
george
replied
his
mother
apologetically
it
is
the
fire
would
burn
a
bit
you
shall
have
it
in
a
few
minutes
though
he
dropped
on
the
sofa
and
began
to
read
a
novel
i
wanted
to
go
but
his
mother
insisted
on
my
staying
do
go
she
pleaded
emily
will
be
so
glad
if
you
stay
father
will
i
sure
sit
down
now
i
sat
down
on
a
rush
chair
by
the
long
window
that
looked
out
into
the
yard
as
he
was
reading
and
as
it
took
all
his
mother
powers
to
watch
the
potatoes
boil
and
the
meat
roast
i
was
left
to
my
thoughts
george
indifferent
to
all
claims
continued
to
read
it
was
very
annoying
to
watch
him
pulling
his
brown
moustache
and
reading
indolently
while
the
dog
rubbed
against
his
leggings
and
against
the
knee
of
his
old
he
would
not
even
be
at
the
trouble
to
play
with
ears
he
was
so
content
with
his
novel
and
his
moustache
round
and
round
twirled
his
thick
fingers
and
the
muscles
of
his
bare
arm
moved
slightly
under
the
skin
the
little
square
window
above
him
filtered
a
green
light
from
the
foliage
of
the
great
outside
and
the
glimmer
fell
on
his
dark
hair
and
trembled
across
the
plates
which
annie
was
reaching
down
from
the
rack
and
across
the
face
of
the
tall
clock
the
kitchen
was
very
big
the
table
looked
lonely
and
the
chairs
mourned
darkly
for
the
lost
companionship
of
the
sofa
the
chimney
was
a
black
cavern
away
at
the
back
and
the
inglenook
seats
shut
in
another
little
compartment
ruddy
with
where
the
mother
hovered
it
was
rather
a
desolate
kitchen
such
a
bare
expanse
of
uneven
grey
flagstones
such
dark
corners
and
sober
furniture
the
only
gay
things
were
the
chintz
coverings
of
the
sofa
and
the
cushions
bright
red
in
the
bare
sombre
room
some
might
smile
at
the
old
clock
adorned
as
it
was
with
remarkable
and
vivid
poultry
in
me
it
only
provoked
wonder
and
contemplation
in
a
little
while
we
heard
the
scraping
of
heavy
boots
outside
and
the
father
entered
he
was
a
big
burly
farmer
with
his
head
sprinkled
with
crisp
little
curls
hullo
cyril
he
said
cheerfully
you
not
forsaken
us
then
and
turning
to
his
son
have
you
many
more
rows
in
the
coppice
close
finished
replied
george
continuing
to
read
that
all
got
on
with
the
rabbits
has
bitten
them
turnips
down
mother
i
expect
so
replied
his
wife
whose
soul
was
in
the
saucepans
at
last
she
deemed
the
potatoes
cooked
and
went
out
with
the
steaming
pan
the
dinner
was
set
on
the
table
and
the
father
began
to
carve
george
looked
over
his
book
to
survey
the
fare
then
read
until
his
plate
was
handed
him
the
maid
sat
at
her
little
table
near
the
window
and
we
began
the
meal
there
came
the
treading
of
four
feet
along
the
brick
path
and
a
little
girl
entered
followed
by
her
sister
the
child
long
brown
hair
was
tossed
wildly
back
beneath
her
sailor
hat
she
flung
aside
this
article
of
her
attire
and
sat
down
to
dinner
talking
endlessly
to
her
mother
the
elder
sister
a
girl
of
about
gave
me
a
smile
and
a
bright
look
from
her
brown
eyes
and
went
to
wash
her
hands
then
she
came
and
sat
down
and
looked
disconsolately
at
the
underdone
beef
on
her
plate
i
do
hate
this
raw
meat
she
said
good
for
you
replied
her
brother
who
was
eating
industriously
give
you
some
muscle
to
wallop
the
nippers
she
pushed
it
aside
and
began
to
eat
the
vegetables
her
brother
his
plate
and
continued
to
eat
well
our
george
i
do
think
you
might
pass
a
body
that
gravy
said
mollie
the
younger
sister
in
injured
tones
certainly
he
replied
wo
you
have
the
joint
as
well
no
retorted
the
young
lady
of
twelve
i
do
expect
you
done
with
it
yet
clever
he
exclaimed
across
a
mouthful
do
you
think
so
said
the
elder
sister
emily
sarcastically
yes
he
replied
complacently
you
made
her
as
sharp
as
yourself
i
see
since
you
had
her
in
standard
six
i
try
a
potato
mother
if
you
can
find
one
that
done
well
george
they
seem
mixed
i
sure
that
was
done
that
i
tried
are
at
this
one
it
soft
enough
i
sure
they
were
boiling
long
enough
do
explain
and
apologise
to
him
said
emily
irritably
perhaps
the
kids
were
too
much
for
her
this
morning
he
said
calmly
to
nobody
in
particular
no
chimed
in
mollie
she
knocked
a
lad
across
his
nose
and
made
it
bleed
little
wretch
said
emily
swallowing
with
difficulty
i
glad
i
did
some
of
my
lads
belong
to
the
devil
suggested
george
but
she
would
not
accept
it
from
him
her
father
sat
laughing
her
mother
with
distress
in
her
eyes
looked
at
her
daughter
who
hung
her
head
and
made
patterns
on
the
with
her
finger
are
they
worse
than
the
last
lot
asked
the
mother
softly
fearfully
extra
was
the
curt
answer
she
merely
felt
like
bashing
said
george
calling
as
he
looked
at
the
sugar
bowl
and
at
his
pudding
fetch
some
more
sugar
annie
the
maid
rose
from
her
little
table
in
the
corner
and
the
mother
also
hurried
to
the
cupboard
emily
trifled
with
her
dinner
and
said
bitterly
to
him
i
only
wish
you
had
a
taste
of
teaching
it
would
cure
your
pf
he
replied
contemptuously
i
could
easily
bleed
the
noses
of
a
handful
of
kids
you
would
sit
there
bleating
like
a
fatted
calf
she
continued
this
speech
so
tickled
mollie
that
she
went
off
into
a
burst
of
laughter
much
to
the
terror
of
her
mother
who
stood
up
in
trembling
apprehension
lest
she
should
choke
you
made
a
joke
emily
he
said
looking
at
his
younger
contortions
emily
was
too
impatient
to
speak
to
him
further
and
left
the
table
soon
the
two
men
went
back
to
the
fallow
to
the
turnips
and
i
walked
along
the
path
with
the
girls
as
they
were
going
to
school
he
irritates
me
in
everything
he
does
and
says
burst
out
emily
with
much
heat
he
a
pig
sometimes
said
i
he
is
she
insisted
he
irritates
me
past
bearing
with
his
grand
way
and
his
heavy
ca
beat
it
and
the
way
mother
humbles
herself
to
it
makes
you
wild
said
i
wild
she
echoed
her
voice
vibrating
with
nervous
passion
we
walked
on
in
silence
till
she
asked
have
you
brought
me
those
verses
of
yours
so
forgotten
them
again
as
a
matter
of
fact
sent
them
away
but
you
promised
me
you
know
what
my
promises
are
i
as
irresponsible
as
a
puff
of
wind
she
frowned
with
impatience
and
her
disappointment
was
greater
than
necessary
when
i
left
her
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
i
felt
a
sting
of
her
deep
reproach
in
my
mind
i
always
felt
the
reproach
when
she
had
gone
i
ran
over
the
little
bright
brook
that
came
from
the
weedy
bottom
pond
the
were
white
in
the
sun
and
the
water
slid
sleepily
among
them
one
or
two
butterflies
indistinguishable
against
the
blue
sky
trifled
from
flower
to
flower
and
led
me
up
the
hill
across
the
field
where
the
hot
sunshine
stood
as
in
a
bowl
and
i
was
entering
the
caverns
of
the
wood
where
the
oaks
bowed
over
and
saved
us
a
grateful
shade
within
everything
was
so
still
and
cool
that
my
steps
hung
heavily
along
the
path
the
bracken
held
out
arms
to
me
and
the
bosom
of
the
wood
was
full
of
sweetness
but
i
journeyed
on
spurred
by
the
attacks
of
an
army
of
flies
which
kept
up
a
guerrilla
warfare
round
my
head
till
i
had
passed
the
black
rhododendron
bushes
in
the
garden
where
they
left
me
scenting
no
doubt
rebecca
pots
of
vinegar
and
sugar
the
low
red
house
with
its
roof
discoloured
and
sunken
dozed
in
sunlight
and
slept
profoundly
in
the
shade
thrown
by
the
massive
maples
encroaching
from
the
wood
there
was
no
one
in
the
but
i
could
hear
the
whirr
of
a
coming
from
the
little
study
a
sound
as
of
some
great
vindictive
insect
buzzing
about
now
louder
now
softer
now
settling
then
came
a
jingling
of
four
or
five
keys
at
the
bottom
of
the
keyboard
of
the
piano
continuing
till
the
whole
range
had
been
covered
in
little
leaps
as
if
some
very
fat
frog
had
jumped
from
end
to
end
that
must
be
mother
dusting
the
i
thought
the
unaccustomed
sound
of
the
old
piano
startled
me
the
vocal
chords
behind
the
green
silk
bosom
only
discovered
it
was
not
a
bronze
silk
bosom
by
poking
a
fold
aside
become
as
thin
and
tuneless
as
a
dried
old
woman
age
had
yellowed
the
teeth
of
my
mother
little
piano
and
shrunken
its
spindle
legs
poor
old
thing
it
could
but
screech
in
answer
to
lettie
fingers
flying
across
it
in
scorn
so
the
prim
brown
lips
were
always
closed
save
to
admit
the
duster
now
however
the
little
old
maidish
piano
began
to
sing
a
tinkling
victorian
melody
and
i
fancied
it
must
be
some
demure
little
woman
with
curls
like
bunches
of
hops
on
either
side
of
her
face
who
was
touching
it
the
coy
little
tune
teased
me
with
old
sensations
but
my
memory
would
give
me
no
assistance
as
i
stood
trying
to
fix
my
vague
feelings
rebecca
came
in
to
remove
the
cloth
from
the
table
who
is
playing
beck
i
asked
your
mother
cyril
but
she
never
plays
i
thought
she
could
ah
replied
rebecca
you
forget
when
you
was
a
little
thing
sitting
playing
against
her
frock
with
the
and
she
singing
to
you
ca
remember
her
when
her
curls
was
long
like
a
piece
of
brown
silk
ca
remember
her
when
she
used
to
play
and
sing
before
lettie
came
and
your
father
rebecca
turned
and
left
the
room
i
went
and
peeped
in
the
mother
sat
before
the
little
brown
piano
with
her
plump
rather
stiff
fingers
moving
across
the
keys
a
faint
smile
on
her
lips
at
that
moment
lettie
came
flying
past
me
and
flung
her
arms
round
neck
kissing
her
and
saying
oh
my
dear
fancy
my
dear
playing
the
piano
oh
little
woman
we
never
knew
you
could
nor
can
i
replied
mother
laughing
disengaging
herself
i
only
wondered
if
i
could
just
strum
out
this
old
tune
i
learned
it
when
i
was
quite
a
girl
on
this
piano
it
was
a
cracked
one
then
the
only
one
i
had
but
play
again
dearie
do
play
again
it
was
like
the
clinking
of
lustre
glasses
and
you
look
so
quaint
at
the
piano
do
play
my
dear
pleaded
lettie
nay
said
my
mother
the
touch
of
the
old
keys
on
my
fingers
is
making
me
would
like
to
see
me
reduced
to
the
tears
of
old
age
old
age
scolded
lettie
kissing
her
again
you
are
young
enough
to
play
little
romances
tell
us
about
it
mother
about
what
child
when
you
used
to
play
before
my
fingers
were
stiff
with
fifty
odd
years
where
have
you
been
cyril
that
you
were
in
to
dinner
only
down
to
strelley
mill
said
i
of
course
said
mother
coldly
why
course
i
asked
and
you
came
away
as
soon
as
em
went
to
school
said
lettie
i
did
said
i
they
were
cross
with
me
these
two
women
after
i
had
swallowed
my
little
resentment
i
said
they
would
have
me
stay
to
dinner
my
mother
vouchsafed
no
reply
and
has
the
great
george
found
a
girl
yet
asked
lettie
no
i
replied
he
never
will
at
this
rate
nobody
will
ever
be
good
enough
for
him
i
sure
i
do
know
what
you
can
find
in
any
of
them
to
take
you
there
so
much
said
my
mother
do
be
so
mean
mater
i
answered
nettled
you
know
i
like
them
i
know
you
like
said
my
mother
sarcastically
as
for
an
unlicked
cub
what
can
you
expect
when
his
mother
has
spoiled
him
as
she
has
but
i
wonder
you
are
so
interested
in
licking
him
my
mother
sniffed
contemptuously
he
is
rather
good
looking
said
lettie
with
a
smile
could
make
a
man
of
him
i
am
sure
i
said
bowing
satirically
to
her
am
not
interested
she
replied
also
satirical
then
she
tossed
her
head
and
all
the
fine
hairs
that
were
free
from
bonds
made
a
mist
of
yellow
light
in
the
sun
what
frock
shall
i
wear
mater
she
asked
nay
do
ask
me
replied
her
mother
i
think
i
wear
the
this
sun
will
fade
it
she
said
pensively
she
was
tall
nearly
six
feet
in
height
but
slenderly
formed
her
hair
was
yellow
tending
towards
a
dun
brown
she
had
beautiful
eyes
and
brows
but
not
a
nice
nose
her
hands
were
very
beautiful
where
are
you
going
i
asked
she
did
not
answer
me
to
tempest
i
said
she
did
not
reply
well
i
do
know
what
you
can
see
in
i
continued
indeed
said
she
he
as
good
as
most
then
we
both
began
to
laugh
not
she
continued
blushing
that
i
think
anything
about
him
merely
going
for
a
game
of
tennis
are
you
coming
what
shall
you
say
if
i
agree
i
asked
oh
she
tossed
her
head
we
shall
all
be
very
pleased
i
sure
ooray
said
i
with
fine
irony
she
laughed
at
me
blushed
and
ran
upstairs
half
an
hour
afterwards
she
popped
her
head
in
the
study
to
bid
me
wishing
to
see
if
i
appreciated
her
she
was
so
charming
in
her
fresh
linen
frock
and
flowered
hat
that
i
could
not
but
be
proud
of
her
she
expected
me
to
follow
her
to
the
window
for
from
between
the
great
purple
rhododendrons
she
waved
me
a
lace
mitten
then
glinted
on
like
a
flower
moving
brightly
through
the
green
hazels
her
path
lay
through
the
wood
in
the
opposite
direction
from
strelley
mill
down
the
red
drive
across
the
space
to
the
highroad
this
road
ran
along
the
end
of
our
lakelet
nethermere
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
nethermere
is
the
lowest
in
a
chain
of
three
ponds
the
other
two
are
the
upper
and
lower
mill
ponds
at
strelley
this
is
the
largest
and
most
charming
piece
of
water
a
mile
long
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
width
our
wood
runs
down
to
the
water
edge
on
the
opposite
side
on
a
hill
beyond
the
farthest
corner
of
the
lake
stands
highclose
it
looks
across
the
water
at
us
in
woodside
with
one
eye
as
it
were
while
our
cottage
casts
a
sidelong
glance
back
again
at
the
proud
house
and
peeps
coyly
through
the
trees
i
could
see
lettie
like
a
distant
sail
stealing
along
the
water
edge
her
parasol
flowing
above
she
turned
through
the
wicket
under
the
pine
clump
climbed
the
steep
field
and
was
enfolded
again
in
the
trees
beside
highclose
leslie
was
sprawled
on
a
under
a
copper
beech
on
the
lawn
his
cigar
glowing
he
watched
the
ash
grow
strange
and
grey
in
the
warm
daylight
and
he
felt
sorry
for
poor
nell
wycherley
whom
he
had
driven
that
morning
to
the
station
for
would
she
not
be
frightfully
cut
up
as
the
train
whirled
her
further
and
further
away
these
girls
are
so
daft
with
a
fellow
but
she
was
a
nice
little
get
marie
to
write
to
her
at
this
point
he
caught
sight
of
a
parasol
fluttering
along
the
drive
and
immediately
he
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
with
just
a
tiny
slit
in
his
slumber
to
allow
him
to
see
lettie
approach
she
finding
her
watchman
ungallantly
asleep
and
his
cigar
instead
of
his
lamp
untrimmed
broke
off
a
twig
of
syringa
whose
ivory
buds
had
not
yet
burst
with
luscious
scent
i
know
not
how
the
end
of
his
nose
tickled
in
anticipation
before
she
tickled
him
in
reality
but
he
kept
bravely
still
until
the
petals
swept
him
then
starting
from
his
sleep
he
exclaimed
lettie
i
was
dreaming
of
kisses
on
the
bridge
of
your
nose
laughed
but
whose
were
the
kisses
who
produced
the
sensation
he
smiled
since
i
only
tapped
your
nose
you
should
dream
go
on
said
he
expectantly
of
doctor
slop
she
replied
smiling
to
herself
as
she
closed
her
parasol
i
do
not
know
the
gentleman
he
said
afraid
that
she
was
laughing
at
him
nose
is
quite
classic
she
answered
giving
him
one
of
those
brief
intimate
glances
with
which
women
flatter
men
so
cleverly
he
radiated
with
pleasure
chapter
ii
dangling
the
apple
the
booming
of
the
wind
in
the
wood
and
the
sobbing
and
moaning
in
the
maples
and
oaks
near
the
house
had
made
lettie
restless
she
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
she
did
not
want
to
do
anything
so
she
insisted
on
my
just
going
out
with
her
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
water
we
crossed
the
tangle
of
fern
and
bracken
bramble
and
wild
raspberry
canes
that
spread
in
the
open
space
before
the
house
and
we
went
down
the
grassy
slope
to
the
edge
of
nethermere
the
wind
whipped
up
noisy
little
wavelets
and
the
cluck
and
clatter
of
these
among
the
pebbles
the
swish
of
the
rushes
and
the
freshening
of
the
breeze
against
our
faces
roused
us
the
tall
was
in
bud
along
the
tiny
beach
and
we
walked
among
it
watching
the
foamy
race
of
the
ripples
and
the
whitening
of
the
willows
on
the
far
shore
at
the
place
where
nethermere
narrows
to
the
upper
end
and
receives
the
brook
from
strelley
the
wood
sweeps
down
and
stands
with
its
feet
washed
round
with
waters
we
broke
our
way
along
the
shore
crushing
the
wild
mint
whose
odour
checks
the
breath
and
examining
here
and
there
among
the
marshy
places
ragged
nests
of
now
deserted
some
slim
young
started
at
our
approach
and
sped
lightly
from
us
their
necks
outstretched
in
straining
fear
of
that
which
could
not
hurt
them
one
two
fled
cheeping
into
cover
of
the
wood
almost
instantly
they
coursed
back
again
to
where
we
stood
to
dart
off
from
us
at
an
angle
in
an
ecstasy
of
bewilderment
and
terror
what
has
frightened
the
crazy
little
things
asked
lettie
i
do
know
they
cheek
enough
sometimes
then
they
go
whining
skelping
off
from
a
fancy
as
if
they
had
a
snake
under
their
wings
lettie
however
paid
small
attention
to
my
eloquence
she
pushed
aside
an
elder
bush
which
graciously
showered
down
upon
her
myriad
crumbs
from
its
flowers
like
slices
of
bread
and
bathed
her
in
a
medicinal
scent
i
followed
her
taking
my
dose
and
was
startled
to
hear
her
sudden
oh
cyril
on
the
bank
before
us
lay
a
black
cat
both
hindpaws
torn
and
bloody
in
a
trap
it
had
no
doubt
been
bounding
forward
after
its
prey
when
it
was
caught
it
was
gaunt
and
wild
no
wonder
it
frightened
the
poor
into
cheeping
hysteria
it
glared
at
us
fiercely
growling
low
how
how
cruel
cried
lettie
shuddering
i
wrapped
my
cap
and
lettie
scarf
over
my
hands
and
bent
to
open
the
trap
the
cat
struck
with
her
teeth
tearing
the
cloth
convulsively
when
it
was
free
it
sprang
away
with
one
bound
and
fell
panting
watching
us
i
wrapped
the
creature
in
my
jacket
and
picked
her
up
murmuring
poor
nickie
always
prophesied
it
of
you
what
will
you
do
with
it
asked
lettie
it
is
one
of
the
strelley
mill
cats
said
i
and
so
i
take
her
home
the
poor
animal
moved
and
murmured
and
i
carried
her
but
we
brought
her
home
they
stared
on
seeing
me
enter
the
kitchen
coatless
carrying
a
strange
bundle
while
lettie
followed
me
i
have
brought
poor
nickie
ben
said
i
unfolding
my
burden
oh
what
a
shame
cried
emily
putting
out
her
hand
to
touch
the
cat
but
drawing
quickly
back
like
the
this
is
how
they
all
go
said
the
mother
i
wish
keepers
had
to
sit
two
or
three
days
with
their
bare
ankles
in
a
trap
said
mollie
in
vindictive
tones
we
laid
the
poor
brute
on
the
rug
and
gave
it
warm
milk
it
drank
very
little
being
too
feeble
mollie
full
of
anger
fetched
nickie
ben
another
fine
black
cat
to
survey
his
crippled
mate
nickie
ben
looked
shrugged
his
sleek
shoulders
and
walked
away
with
high
steps
there
was
a
general
feminine
outcry
on
masculine
callousness
george
came
in
for
hot
water
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
on
seeing
us
and
his
eyes
became
animated
look
at
nickie
ben
cried
mollie
he
dropped
on
his
knees
on
the
rug
and
lifted
the
wounded
paws
broken
said
he
how
awful
said
emily
shuddering
violently
and
leaving
the
room
both
i
asked
only
you
are
hurting
her
cried
lettie
it
no
good
said
he
mollie
and
the
mother
hurried
out
of
the
kitchen
into
the
parlour
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
lettie
put
her
out
of
her
misery
he
replied
taking
up
the
poor
cat
we
followed
him
into
the
barn
the
quickest
way
said
he
is
to
swing
her
round
and
knock
her
head
against
the
wall
you
make
me
sick
exclaimed
lettie
i
drown
her
then
he
said
with
a
smile
we
watched
him
morbidly
as
he
took
a
length
of
twine
and
fastened
a
noose
round
the
animal
neck
and
near
it
an
iron
goose
he
kept
a
long
piece
of
cord
attached
to
the
goose
you
not
coming
are
you
said
he
lettie
looked
at
him
she
had
grown
rather
white
it
make
you
sick
he
said
she
did
not
answer
but
followed
him
across
the
yard
to
the
garden
on
the
bank
of
the
lower
he
turned
again
to
us
and
said
now
for
it
are
chief
mourners
as
neither
of
us
replied
he
smiled
and
dropped
the
poor
writhing
cat
into
the
water
saying
nickie
ben
we
waited
on
the
bank
some
time
he
eyed
us
curiously
cyril
said
lettie
quietly
is
it
cruel
it
awful
i
had
nothing
to
say
do
you
mean
me
asked
george
not
you
in
if
we
move
the
blood
rises
in
our
he
looked
at
her
seriously
with
dark
eyes
i
had
to
drown
her
out
of
mercy
said
he
fastening
the
cord
he
held
to
an
then
he
went
to
get
a
spade
and
with
it
he
dug
a
grave
in
the
old
black
earth
if
said
he
the
poor
old
cat
had
made
a
prettier
corpse
you
have
thrown
violets
on
her
he
had
struck
the
spade
into
the
ground
and
hauled
up
the
cat
and
the
iron
goose
well
he
said
surveying
the
hideous
object
have
her
good
looks
gone
she
was
a
fine
cat
bury
it
and
have
done
lettie
replied
he
did
so
asking
shall
you
have
bad
dreams
after
it
dreams
do
not
trouble
me
she
answered
turning
away
we
went
indoors
into
the
parlour
where
emily
sat
by
a
window
biting
her
finger
the
room
was
long
and
not
very
high
there
was
a
great
rough
beam
across
the
ceiling
on
the
and
in
the
fireplace
and
over
the
piano
were
wild
flowers
and
fresh
leaves
plentifully
scattered
the
room
was
cool
with
the
scent
of
the
woods
has
he
done
it
asked
and
did
you
watch
him
if
i
had
seen
it
i
should
have
hated
the
sight
of
him
and
i
rather
have
touched
a
maggot
than
him
i
should
be
particularly
pleased
if
he
touched
me
said
lettie
there
is
something
so
loathsome
about
callousness
and
brutality
said
emily
he
fills
me
with
disgust
does
he
said
lettie
smiling
coldly
she
went
across
to
the
old
piano
he
only
healthy
he
never
been
sick
not
anyway
yet
she
sat
down
and
played
at
random
letting
the
numbed
notes
fall
like
dead
leaves
from
the
haughty
ancient
piano
emily
and
i
talked
on
by
the
window
about
books
and
people
she
was
intensely
serious
and
generally
succeeded
in
reducing
me
to
the
same
state
after
a
while
when
the
milking
and
feeding
were
finished
george
came
in
lettie
was
still
playing
the
piano
he
asked
her
why
she
did
play
something
with
a
tune
in
it
and
this
caused
her
to
turn
round
in
her
chair
to
give
him
a
withering
answer
his
appearance
however
scattered
her
words
like
startled
birds
he
had
come
straight
from
washing
in
the
scullery
to
the
parlour
and
he
stood
behind
lettie
chair
unconcernedly
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
arms
his
sleeves
were
rolled
up
to
the
shoulder
and
his
shirt
was
opened
wide
at
the
breast
lettie
was
somewhat
taken
aback
by
the
sight
of
him
standing
with
legs
apart
dressed
in
dirty
leggings
and
boots
and
breeches
torn
at
the
knee
naked
at
the
breast
and
arms
why
do
you
play
something
with
a
tune
in
it
he
repeated
rubbing
the
towel
over
his
shoulders
beneath
the
shirt
a
tune
she
echoed
watching
the
swelling
of
his
arms
as
he
moved
them
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
breasts
wonderfully
solid
and
white
then
having
curiously
examined
the
sudden
meeting
of
the
sunhot
skin
with
the
white
flesh
in
his
throat
her
eyes
met
his
and
she
turned
again
to
the
piano
while
the
colour
grew
in
her
ears
mercifully
sheltered
by
a
profusion
of
bright
curls
what
shall
i
play
she
asked
fingering
the
keys
somewhat
confusedly
he
dragged
out
a
book
of
songs
from
a
little
heap
of
music
and
set
it
before
her
which
do
you
want
to
sing
she
asked
thrilling
a
little
as
she
felt
his
arms
so
near
her
anything
you
like
a
love
song
she
said
if
you
a
love
he
laughed
with
clumsy
insinuation
that
made
the
girl
writhe
she
did
not
answer
but
began
to
play
sullivan
tit
willow
he
had
a
passable
bass
voice
not
of
any
great
depth
and
he
sang
with
gusto
then
she
gave
him
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
at
the
end
she
turned
and
asked
him
if
he
liked
the
words
he
replied
that
he
thought
them
rather
daft
but
he
looked
at
her
with
glowing
brown
eyes
as
if
in
hesitating
challenge
that
because
you
have
no
wine
in
your
eyes
to
pledge
with
she
replied
answering
his
challenge
with
a
blue
blaze
of
her
eyes
then
her
eyelashes
drooped
on
to
her
cheek
he
laughed
with
a
faint
ring
of
consciousness
and
asked
her
how
could
she
know
because
she
said
slowly
looking
up
at
him
with
pretended
scorn
because
there
no
change
in
your
eyes
when
i
look
at
you
i
always
think
people
who
are
worth
much
talk
with
their
eyes
that
why
you
are
forced
to
respect
many
quite
uneducated
people
their
eyes
are
so
eloquent
and
full
of
knowledge
she
had
continued
to
look
at
him
as
she
his
faint
appreciation
of
her
upturned
face
and
her
hair
where
the
light
was
always
tangled
watching
his
brief
to
see
if
he
could
feel
any
truth
in
her
words
watching
till
he
broke
into
a
little
laugh
which
was
rather
more
awkward
and
less
satisfied
than
usual
then
she
turned
away
smiling
also
there
nothing
in
this
book
nice
to
sing
she
said
turning
over
the
leaves
discontentedly
i
found
her
a
volume
and
she
sang
should
he
upbraid
she
had
a
fine
soprano
voice
and
the
song
delighted
him
he
moved
nearer
to
her
and
when
at
the
finish
she
looked
round
with
a
flashing
mischievous
air
she
found
him
pledging
her
with
wonderful
eyes
you
like
that
said
she
with
the
air
of
superior
knowledge
as
if
dear
me
all
one
had
to
do
was
to
turn
over
to
the
right
page
of
the
vast
volume
of
one
soul
to
suit
these
people
i
do
he
answered
emphatically
thus
acknowledging
her
triumph
i
rather
and
sing
round
care
than
carefully
shut
the
door
on
him
while
i
slept
in
the
chimney
would
you
she
asked
he
laughed
and
began
to
consider
what
she
meant
before
he
replied
as
you
do
she
added
what
he
asked
keep
half
your
senses
alive
do
i
he
asked
of
course
you
do
an
ox
you
are
like
a
stalled
ox
food
and
comfort
no
more
do
you
love
comfort
she
smiled
do
you
he
replied
smiling
shamefaced
of
course
come
and
turn
over
for
me
while
i
play
this
piece
well
i
nod
when
you
must
a
chair
she
began
to
play
a
romance
of
schubert
he
leaned
nearer
to
her
to
take
hold
of
the
leaf
of
music
she
felt
her
loose
hair
touch
his
face
and
turned
to
him
a
quick
laughing
glance
while
she
played
at
the
end
of
the
page
she
nodded
but
he
was
oblivious
yes
she
said
suddenly
impatient
and
he
tried
to
get
the
leaf
over
she
quickly
pushed
his
hand
aside
turned
the
page
herself
and
continued
playing
sorry
said
he
blushing
actually
do
bother
she
said
continuing
to
play
without
observing
him
when
she
had
finished
there
she
said
now
tell
me
how
you
felt
while
i
was
playing
fool
replied
covered
with
confusion
i
glad
to
hear
it
she
but
i
did
mean
that
i
meant
how
did
the
music
make
you
feel
i
do
made
me
feel
anything
he
replied
deliberately
pondering
over
his
answer
as
usual
i
tell
you
she
declared
you
either
asleep
or
stupid
did
you
really
see
nothing
in
the
music
but
what
did
you
think
about
he
thought
laughed
again
why
he
admitted
laughing
and
trying
to
tell
the
exact
truth
i
thought
how
pretty
your
hands
what
they
are
like
to
i
thought
it
was
a
new
experience
to
feel
somebody
hair
tickling
my
cheek
when
he
had
finished
his
deliberate
account
she
gave
his
hand
a
little
knock
and
left
him
saying
you
are
worse
and
worse
she
came
across
the
room
to
the
couch
where
i
was
sitting
talking
to
emily
and
put
her
arm
around
my
neck
is
it
time
to
go
home
pat
she
asked
half
past
early
said
i
but
i
think
i
ought
to
be
home
now
she
said
do
go
said
he
why
i
asked
stay
to
supper
urged
emily
but
i
she
hesitated
she
has
another
fish
to
fry
i
said
i
am
not
she
hesitated
again
then
she
flashed
into
sudden
wrath
exclaiming
do
be
so
mean
and
nasty
cyril
were
you
going
somewhere
asked
george
humbly
she
said
blushing
then
stay
to
you
he
begged
she
laughed
and
yielded
we
went
into
the
kitchen
saxton
was
sitting
reading
trip
the
big
bull
terrier
lay
at
his
feet
pretending
to
sleep
nickie
ben
reposed
calmly
on
the
sofa
saxton
and
mollie
were
just
going
to
bed
we
bade
them
and
sat
down
annie
the
servant
had
gone
home
so
emily
prepared
the
supper
nobody
can
touch
that
piano
like
you
said
saxton
to
lettie
beaming
upon
her
with
admiration
and
deference
he
was
proud
of
the
stately
mumbling
old
thing
and
used
to
say
that
it
was
full
of
music
for
those
that
liked
to
ask
for
it
lettie
laughed
and
said
that
so
few
folks
ever
tried
it
that
her
honour
was
not
great
what
do
you
think
of
our
george
singing
asked
the
father
proudly
but
with
a
deprecating
laugh
at
the
end
i
tell
him
when
he
in
love
he
sing
quite
well
she
said
when
he
in
love
echoed
the
father
laughing
aloud
very
pleased
yes
she
said
when
he
finds
out
something
he
wants
and
ca
have
george
thought
about
it
and
he
laughed
also
emily
who
was
laying
the
table
said
there
is
hardly
any
water
in
the
pippin
george
oh
dash
he
exclaimed
i
taken
my
boots
off
it
not
a
very
big
job
to
put
them
on
again
said
his
sister
why
could
annie
fetch
she
here
for
he
said
angrily
emily
looked
at
us
tossed
her
head
and
turned
her
back
on
him
i
go
i
go
after
supper
said
the
father
in
a
comforting
tone
after
supper
laughed
emily
george
got
up
and
shuffled
out
he
had
to
go
into
the
spinney
near
the
house
to
a
well
and
being
warm
disliked
turning
out
we
had
just
sat
down
to
supper
when
trip
rushed
barking
to
the
door
be
quiet
ordered
the
father
thinking
of
those
in
bed
and
he
followed
the
dog
it
was
leslie
he
wanted
lettie
to
go
home
with
him
at
once
this
she
refused
to
do
so
he
came
indoors
and
was
persuaded
to
sit
down
at
table
he
swallowed
a
morsel
of
bread
and
cheese
and
a
cup
of
coffee
talking
to
lettie
of
a
garden
party
which
was
going
to
be
arranged
at
highclose
for
the
following
week
what
is
it
for
then
interrupted
saxton
for
echoed
leslie
is
it
for
the
missionaries
or
the
unemployed
or
something
explained
saxton
it
a
not
a
bazaar
said
leslie
private
affair
i
thought
it
would
be
some
church
matter
of
your
mother
she
very
big
at
the
church
is
she
she
is
interested
in
the
said
leslie
then
proceeding
to
explain
to
lettie
that
he
was
arranging
a
tennis
tournament
in
which
she
was
to
take
part
at
this
point
he
became
aware
that
he
was
monopolising
the
conversation
and
turned
to
george
just
as
the
latter
was
taking
a
piece
of
cheese
from
his
knife
with
his
teeth
asking
do
you
play
tennis
saxton
know
miss
saxton
does
not
no
said
george
working
the
piece
of
cheese
into
his
cheek
i
never
learned
any
ladies
accomplishments
leslie
turned
to
emily
who
had
nervously
been
pushing
two
plates
over
a
stain
in
the
cloth
and
who
was
very
startled
when
she
found
herself
addressed
my
mother
would
be
so
glad
if
you
would
come
to
the
party
miss
saxton
i
can
not
i
shall
be
at
school
thanks
very
much
very
good
of
you
said
the
father
beaming
but
george
smiled
contemptuously
when
supper
was
over
leslie
looked
at
lettie
to
inform
her
that
he
was
ready
to
go
she
however
refused
to
see
his
look
but
talked
brightly
to
saxton
who
was
delighted
george
flattered
joined
in
the
talk
with
gusto
then
leslie
angry
silence
began
to
tell
on
us
all
after
a
dull
lapse
george
lifted
his
head
and
said
to
his
father
oh
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
little
red
heifer
calved
lettie
eyes
flashed
with
a
sparkle
of
amusement
at
this
thrust
no
assented
the
father
i
thought
so
myself
after
a
moment
silence
george
continued
deliberately
i
felt
her
george
said
emily
sharply
we
will
go
said
leslie
george
looked
up
sideways
at
lettie
and
his
black
eyes
were
full
of
sardonic
mischief
lend
me
a
shawl
will
you
emily
said
lettie
i
brought
nothing
and
i
think
the
wind
is
cold
emily
however
regretted
that
she
had
no
shawl
and
so
lettie
must
needs
wear
a
black
coat
over
her
summer
dress
it
fitted
so
absurdly
that
we
all
laughed
but
leslie
was
very
angry
that
she
should
appear
ludicrous
before
them
he
showed
her
all
the
polite
attentions
possible
fastened
the
neck
of
her
coat
with
his
pearl
refusing
the
pin
emily
discovered
after
some
search
then
we
sallied
forth
when
we
were
outside
he
offered
lettie
his
arm
with
an
air
of
injured
dignity
she
refused
it
and
he
began
to
remonstrate
i
consider
you
ought
to
have
been
home
as
you
promised
pardon
me
she
replied
but
i
did
not
promise
but
you
knew
i
was
coming
said
he
found
me
she
retorted
yes
he
assented
i
did
find
you
flirting
with
a
common
fellow
he
sneered
well
she
returned
he
is
a
heifer
a
heifer
and
i
should
think
you
liked
it
he
said
i
did
mind
she
said
with
galling
negligence
i
thought
your
taste
was
more
refined
he
replied
sarcastically
but
i
suppose
you
thought
it
romantic
very
ruddy
dark
and
really
thrilling
eyes
said
she
i
hate
to
hear
a
girl
talk
rot
said
leslie
he
himself
had
crisp
hair
of
the
ginger
class
but
i
mean
it
she
insisted
aggravating
his
anger
leslie
was
angry
i
glad
he
amuses
you
of
course
i
not
hard
to
please
she
said
pointedly
he
was
stung
to
the
quick
then
there
some
comfort
in
knowing
i
do
please
you
he
said
coldly
oh
but
you
do
you
amuse
me
also
she
said
after
that
he
would
not
speak
preferring
i
suppose
to
amuse
her
lettie
took
my
arm
and
with
her
disengaged
hand
held
her
skirts
above
the
wet
grass
when
he
had
left
us
at
the
end
of
the
riding
in
the
wood
lettie
said
what
an
infant
he
is
a
bit
of
an
ass
i
admitted
but
really
she
said
he
more
agreeable
on
the
whole
my
taurus
your
bull
i
repeated
laughing
chapter
iii
a
vendor
of
visions
the
sunday
following
lettie
visit
to
the
mill
leslie
came
up
in
the
morning
admirably
dressed
and
perfected
by
a
grand
air
i
showed
him
into
the
dark
and
left
him
ordinarily
he
would
have
wandered
to
the
stairs
and
sat
there
calling
to
lettie
he
was
silent
i
carried
the
news
of
his
arrival
to
my
sister
who
was
pinning
on
her
brooch
and
how
is
the
dear
boy
she
asked
i
have
not
inquired
said
i
she
laughed
and
loitered
about
till
it
was
time
to
set
off
for
church
before
she
came
downstairs
then
she
also
assumed
the
grand
air
and
bowed
to
him
with
a
beautiful
bow
he
was
somewhat
taken
aback
and
had
nothing
to
say
she
rustled
across
the
room
to
the
window
where
the
white
geraniums
grew
magnificently
i
must
adorn
myself
she
said
it
was
leslie
custom
to
bring
her
flowers
as
he
had
not
done
so
this
day
she
was
piqued
he
hated
the
scent
and
chalky
whiteness
of
the
geraniums
so
she
smiled
at
him
as
she
pinned
them
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
saying
they
are
very
fine
are
they
not
he
muttered
that
they
were
mother
came
downstairs
greeted
him
warmly
and
asked
him
if
he
would
take
her
to
church
if
you
will
allow
me
said
he
you
are
modest
laughed
mother
he
repeated
i
hate
modesty
in
a
young
man
said
come
we
shall
be
late
lettie
wore
the
geraniums
all
evening
she
brought
alice
gall
home
to
tea
and
bade
me
bring
up
mon
taureau
when
his
farm
work
was
over
the
day
had
been
hot
and
close
the
sun
was
reddening
in
the
west
as
we
leaped
across
the
lesser
brook
the
evening
scents
began
to
awake
and
wander
unseen
through
the
still
air
an
occasional
yellow
sunbeam
would
slant
through
the
thick
roof
of
leaves
and
cling
passionately
to
the
orange
clusters
of
berries
the
trees
were
silent
drawing
together
to
sleep
only
a
few
pink
orchids
stood
palely
by
the
path
looking
wistfully
out
at
the
ranks
of
bugle
whose
last
flowers
glowing
from
the
top
of
the
bronze
column
yearned
darkly
for
the
sun
we
sauntered
on
in
silence
not
breaking
the
first
hush
of
the
woodlands
as
we
drew
near
home
we
heard
a
murmur
from
among
the
trees
from
the
lover
seat
where
a
great
tree
had
fallen
and
remained
mossed
and
covered
with
fragile
growth
there
a
crooked
bough
made
a
beautiful
seat
for
two
fancy
being
in
love
and
making
a
row
in
such
a
twilight
said
i
as
we
continued
our
way
but
when
we
came
opposite
the
fallen
tree
we
saw
no
lovers
there
but
a
man
sleeping
and
muttering
through
his
sleep
the
cap
had
fallen
from
his
grizzled
hair
and
his
head
leaned
back
against
a
profusion
of
the
little
wild
geraniums
that
decorated
the
dead
bough
so
delicately
the
man
clothing
was
good
but
slovenly
and
neglected
his
face
was
pale
and
worn
with
sickness
and
dissipation
as
he
slept
his
grey
beard
wagged
and
his
loose
unlovely
mouth
moved
in
indistinct
speech
he
was
acting
over
again
some
part
of
his
life
and
his
features
twitched
during
the
unnatural
sleep
he
would
give
a
little
groan
gruesome
to
hear
and
then
talk
to
some
woman
his
features
twitched
as
if
with
pain
and
he
moaned
slightly
the
lips
opened
in
a
grimace
showing
the
yellow
teeth
behind
the
beard
then
he
began
again
talking
in
his
throat
thickly
so
that
we
could
only
tell
part
of
what
he
said
it
was
very
unpleasant
i
wondered
how
we
should
end
it
suddenly
through
the
gloom
of
the
woods
came
the
scream
of
a
rabbit
caught
by
a
weasel
the
man
awoke
with
a
sharp
ah
looked
round
in
consternation
then
sinking
down
again
wearily
said
i
was
dreaming
again
you
do
seem
to
have
nice
dreams
said
george
the
man
winced
then
looking
at
us
said
almost
sneering
and
who
are
you
we
did
not
answer
but
waited
for
him
to
move
he
sat
still
looking
at
us
so
he
said
at
last
wearily
i
do
dream
i
do
i
do
he
sighed
heavily
then
he
added
sarcastically
were
you
interested
no
said
i
but
you
are
out
of
your
way
surely
which
road
did
you
want
you
want
me
to
clear
out
he
said
well
i
said
laughing
in
deprecation
i
do
mind
your
dreaming
but
this
is
not
the
way
to
anywhere
where
may
you
be
going
then
he
asked
i
home
i
replied
with
dignity
you
are
a
beardsall
he
queried
eyeing
me
with
bloodshot
eyes
i
am
i
replied
with
more
dignity
wondering
who
the
fellow
could
be
he
sat
a
few
moments
looking
at
me
it
was
getting
dark
in
the
wood
then
he
took
up
an
ebony
stick
with
a
gold
head
and
rose
the
stick
seemed
to
catch
at
my
imagination
i
watched
it
curiously
as
we
walked
with
the
old
man
along
the
path
to
the
gate
we
went
with
him
into
the
open
road
when
we
reached
the
clear
sky
where
the
light
from
the
west
fell
full
on
our
faces
he
turned
again
and
looked
at
us
closely
his
mouth
opened
sharply
as
if
he
would
speak
but
he
stopped
himself
and
only
said
shall
you
be
all
right
i
asked
seeing
him
totter
lad
he
walked
away
feebly
into
the
darkness
we
saw
the
lights
of
a
vehicle
on
the
after
a
while
we
heard
the
bang
of
a
door
and
a
cab
rattled
away
he
said
george
laughing
do
you
know
said
i
it
made
me
feel
a
bit
rotten
ay
he
laughed
turning
up
the
end
of
the
exclamation
with
indulgent
surprise
we
went
back
home
deciding
to
say
nothing
to
the
women
they
were
sitting
in
the
window
seat
watching
for
us
mother
and
alice
and
lettie
you
been
a
long
time
said
lettie
we
watched
the
sun
go
set
rim
of
the
hill
is
smouldering
yet
what
have
you
been
doing
waiting
till
your
taurus
finished
work
now
be
quiet
she
said
hastily
to
him
you
have
come
to
sing
hymns
anything
you
like
he
replied
how
nice
of
you
george
exclaimed
alice
ironically
she
was
a
short
plump
girl
pale
with
daring
rebellious
eyes
her
mother
was
a
wyld
a
family
famous
either
for
shocking
lawlessness
or
for
extreme
uprightness
alice
with
an
admirable
father
and
a
mother
who
loved
her
husband
passionately
was
wild
and
lawless
on
the
surface
but
at
heart
very
upright
and
amenable
my
mother
and
she
were
fast
friends
and
lettie
had
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
with
her
but
lettie
generally
deplored
alice
outrageous
behaviour
though
she
relished
superior
friends
were
not
present
most
men
enjoyed
alice
in
company
but
they
fought
shy
of
being
alone
with
her
would
you
say
the
same
to
me
she
asked
it
depends
what
you
answer
he
said
laughingly
oh
you
so
bloomin
cautious
i
rather
have
a
tack
in
my
shoe
than
a
cautious
man
would
you
lettie
depends
how
far
i
had
to
walk
was
lettie
but
if
i
had
to
limp
too
alice
turned
away
from
lettie
whom
she
often
found
rather
irritating
you
do
look
glum
sybil
she
said
to
me
did
somebody
want
to
kiss
you
i
the
wrong
side
understanding
her
malicious
feminine
answered
if
they
had
i
should
have
looked
happy
dear
boy
smile
now
then
she
tipped
me
under
the
chin
i
drew
away
oh
are
solemn
what
the
matter
with
you
begin
to
feel
nervous
what
shall
i
say
he
asked
shifting
his
feet
and
resting
his
elbows
on
his
knees
oh
lor
she
cried
in
great
impatience
he
did
not
help
her
but
sat
clasping
his
hands
smiling
on
one
side
of
his
face
he
was
nervous
he
looked
at
the
pictures
the
ornaments
and
everything
in
the
room
lettie
got
up
to
settle
some
flowers
on
the
and
he
scrutinised
her
closely
she
was
dressed
in
some
blue
foulard
stuff
with
lace
at
the
throat
and
lace
cuffs
to
the
elbow
she
was
tall
and
supple
her
hair
had
a
curling
fluffiness
very
charming
he
was
no
taller
than
she
and
looked
shorter
being
strongly
built
he
too
had
a
grace
of
his
own
but
not
as
he
sat
stiffly
on
a
chair
she
was
elegant
in
her
movements
after
a
little
while
mother
called
us
in
to
supper
come
said
lettie
to
him
take
me
in
to
supper
he
rose
feeling
very
awkward
give
me
your
arm
said
she
to
tease
him
he
did
so
and
flushed
under
his
tan
afraid
of
her
round
arm
half
hidden
by
lace
which
lay
among
his
sleeve
when
we
were
seated
she
flourished
her
spoon
and
asked
him
what
he
would
have
he
hesitated
looked
at
the
strange
dishes
and
said
he
would
have
some
cheese
they
insisted
on
his
eating
new
complicated
meats
i
sure
you
like
tantafflins
do
you
georgie
said
alice
in
her
mocking
fashion
he
was
sure
he
could
not
analyse
the
flavours
he
felt
confused
and
bewildered
even
through
his
sense
of
taste
alice
begged
him
to
have
salad
no
thanks
said
he
i
do
like
it
oh
george
she
said
how
you
say
so
when
i
it
you
only
had
it
once
said
he
and
that
was
when
i
was
working
with
flint
and
he
gave
us
fat
bacon
and
bits
of
lettuce
soaked
in
ave
a
bit
more
salit
he
kept
saying
but
i
had
enough
but
all
our
lettuce
said
alice
with
a
wink
is
as
sweet
as
a
nut
no
vinegar
about
our
lettuce
george
laughed
in
much
confusion
at
her
pun
on
my
sister
name
i
believe
you
he
said
with
pompous
gallantry
think
of
that
cried
alice
our
georgie
believes
me
oh
i
am
so
so
pleased
he
smiled
painfully
his
hand
was
resting
on
the
table
the
thumb
tucked
tight
under
the
fingers
his
knuckles
white
as
he
nervously
gripped
his
thumb
at
last
supper
was
finished
and
he
picked
up
his
serviette
from
the
floor
and
began
to
fold
it
lettie
also
seemed
ill
at
ease
she
had
teased
him
till
the
sense
of
his
awkwardness
had
become
uncomfortable
now
she
felt
sorry
and
a
trifle
repentant
so
she
went
to
the
piano
as
she
always
did
to
dispel
her
moods
when
she
was
angry
she
played
tender
fragments
of
tschaïkowsky
when
she
was
miserable
mozart
now
she
played
handel
in
a
manner
that
suggested
the
plains
of
heaven
in
the
long
notes
and
in
the
little
trills
as
if
she
were
waltzing
up
the
ladder
of
jacob
dream
like
the
damsels
in
blake
pictures
i
often
told
her
she
flattered
herself
scandalously
through
the
piano
but
generally
she
pretended
not
to
understand
me
and
occasionally
she
surprised
me
by
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
to
her
eyes
for
george
sake
she
played
gounod
ave
maria
knowing
that
the
sentiment
of
the
chant
would
appeal
to
him
and
make
him
sad
forgetful
of
the
petty
evils
of
this
life
i
smiled
as
i
watched
the
cheap
spell
working
when
she
had
finished
her
fingers
lay
motionless
for
a
minute
on
the
keys
then
she
spun
round
and
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
giving
promise
of
a
smile
but
she
glanced
down
at
her
knee
you
are
tired
of
music
she
said
no
he
replied
shaking
his
head
like
it
better
than
salad
she
asked
with
a
flash
of
raillery
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
sudden
smile
but
did
not
reply
he
was
not
handsome
his
features
were
too
often
in
a
heavy
repose
but
when
he
looked
up
and
smiled
unexpectedly
he
flooded
her
with
an
access
of
tenderness
then
you
have
a
little
more
said
she
and
she
turned
again
to
the
piano
she
played
soft
wistful
morsels
then
suddenly
broke
off
in
the
midst
of
one
sentimental
plaint
and
left
the
piano
dropping
into
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
there
she
sat
and
looked
at
him
he
was
conscious
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
but
he
dared
not
look
back
at
her
so
he
pulled
his
moustache
you
are
only
a
boy
after
all
she
said
to
him
quietly
then
he
turned
and
asked
her
why
it
is
a
boy
that
you
are
she
repeated
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
smiling
lazily
at
him
i
never
thought
so
he
replied
seriously
really
she
said
chuckling
no
said
he
trying
to
recall
his
previous
impressions
she
laughed
heartily
saying
you
growing
up
how
he
asked
growing
up
she
repeated
still
laughing
but
i
sure
i
was
never
boyish
said
he
i
teaching
you
said
she
and
when
you
boyish
you
be
a
very
decent
man
a
mere
man
dare
be
a
boy
for
fear
of
tumbling
off
his
manly
dignity
and
then
he
be
a
fool
poor
thing
he
laughed
and
sat
still
to
think
about
it
as
was
his
way
do
you
like
pictures
she
asked
suddenly
being
tired
of
looking
at
him
better
than
anything
he
replied
except
dinner
and
a
warm
hearth
and
a
lazy
evening
she
said
he
looked
at
her
suddenly
hardening
at
her
insult
and
biting
his
lips
at
the
taste
of
this
humiliation
she
repented
and
smiled
her
plaintive
regret
to
him
i
show
you
some
she
said
rising
and
going
out
of
the
room
he
felt
he
was
nearer
her
she
returned
carrying
a
pile
of
great
books
pretty
strong
said
he
you
are
charming
in
your
compliment
she
said
he
glanced
at
her
to
see
if
she
were
mocking
that
the
highest
you
could
say
of
me
is
it
she
insisted
is
it
he
asked
unwilling
to
compromise
himself
for
sure
she
then
laying
the
books
on
the
table
i
know
how
a
man
will
compliment
me
by
the
way
he
looks
at
me
kneeled
before
the
fire
some
look
at
my
hair
some
watch
the
rise
and
fall
of
my
breathing
some
look
at
my
neck
and
a
few
you
among
them
me
in
the
eyes
for
my
thoughts
to
you
i
a
fine
specimen
strong
pretty
strong
you
primitive
man
he
sat
twisting
his
fingers
she
was
very
contrary
bring
your
chair
up
she
said
sitting
down
at
the
table
and
opening
a
book
she
talked
to
him
of
each
picture
insisting
on
hearing
his
opinion
sometimes
he
disagreed
with
her
and
would
not
be
persuaded
at
such
times
she
was
piqued
if
said
she
an
ancient
briton
in
his
skins
came
and
contradicted
me
as
you
do
would
you
tell
him
not
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
i
do
know
said
he
then
you
ought
to
she
replied
you
know
nothing
how
is
it
you
ask
me
then
he
said
she
began
to
laugh
a
pertinent
question
i
think
you
might
be
rather
nice
you
know
thank
you
he
said
smiling
ironically
oh
she
said
i
know
you
think
you
perfect
but
you
not
you
very
annoying
yes
exclaimed
alice
who
had
entered
the
room
again
dressed
ready
to
depart
he
so
blooming
slow
great
whizz
who
wants
fellows
to
carry
cold
dinners
should
you
like
to
shake
him
lettie
i
do
feel
concerned
enough
replied
the
other
calmly
did
you
ever
carry
a
boiled
pudding
georgy
asked
alice
with
innocent
interest
punching
me
slyly
me
makes
you
ask
he
replied
quite
at
a
loss
oh
i
only
wondered
if
your
people
needed
any
indigestion
mixes
a
bottle
i
do
he
began
old
boy
i
give
you
time
to
think
about
it
lettie
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
someone
else
farewell
come
along
sybil
love
the
moon
is
all
i
escorted
her
home
while
they
continued
to
look
at
the
pictures
he
was
a
romanticist
he
liked
copley
fielding
cattermole
and
birket
foster
he
could
see
nothing
whatsoever
in
girtin
or
david
cox
they
fell
out
decidedly
over
george
clausen
but
said
lettie
he
is
a
real
realist
he
makes
common
things
beautiful
he
sees
the
mystery
and
magnificence
that
envelops
us
even
when
we
work
menially
i
know
and
i
speak
if
i
hoed
in
the
fields
beside
this
was
a
very
new
idea
for
him
almost
a
shock
to
his
imagination
and
she
talked
unheeded
the
picture
under
discussion
was
a
hoeing
by
clausen
you
be
just
that
colour
in
the
sunset
she
said
thus
bringing
him
back
to
the
subject
and
if
you
looked
at
the
ground
you
find
there
was
a
sense
of
warm
gold
fire
in
it
and
once
you
perceived
the
colour
it
would
strengthen
till
you
see
nothing
else
you
are
blind
you
are
only
you
are
gross
with
good
living
and
heavy
sleeping
you
are
a
piano
which
will
only
play
a
dozen
common
notes
sunset
is
nothing
to
merely
happens
anywhere
oh
but
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
like
to
make
you
suffer
if
you
ever
been
sick
if
you
ever
been
born
into
a
home
where
there
was
something
oppressed
you
and
you
could
understand
if
ever
you
believed
or
even
doubted
you
might
have
been
a
man
by
now
you
never
grow
up
like
bulbs
which
spend
all
summer
getting
fat
and
fleshy
but
never
wakening
the
germ
of
a
flower
as
for
me
the
flower
is
born
in
me
but
it
wants
bringing
forth
things
do
flower
if
they
overfed
you
have
to
suffer
before
you
blossom
in
this
life
when
death
is
just
touching
a
plant
it
forces
it
into
a
passion
of
flowering
you
wonder
how
i
have
touched
death
you
do
know
there
always
a
sense
of
death
in
this
home
i
believe
my
mother
hated
my
father
before
i
was
born
that
was
death
in
her
veins
for
me
before
i
was
born
it
makes
a
as
he
sat
listening
his
eyes
grew
wide
and
his
lips
were
parted
like
a
child
who
feels
the
tale
but
does
not
understand
the
words
she
looking
away
from
herself
at
last
saw
him
began
to
laugh
gently
and
patted
his
hand
saying
oh
my
dear
heart
are
you
bewildered
how
amiable
of
you
to
listen
to
is
any
meaning
in
it
is
really
but
said
he
why
do
you
say
it
oh
the
question
she
laughed
let
us
go
back
to
our
muttons
gazing
at
each
other
like
two
dazed
images
they
turned
on
chatting
casually
till
george
suddenly
exclaimed
there
it
was
maurice
griffinhagen
idyll
what
of
it
she
asked
gradually
flushing
she
remembered
her
own
enthusiasm
over
the
picture
would
it
be
fine
he
exclaimed
looking
at
her
with
glowing
eyes
his
teeth
showing
white
in
a
smile
that
was
not
amusement
what
she
asked
dropping
her
head
in
confusion
girl
like
passion
he
lit
up
curiously
she
may
well
be
half
afraid
when
the
barbarian
comes
out
in
his
glory
skins
and
all
but
do
you
like
it
he
asked
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
saying
make
love
to
the
next
girl
you
meet
and
by
the
time
the
poppies
redden
the
field
she
hang
in
your
arms
she
have
need
to
be
more
than
half
afraid
wo
she
she
played
with
the
leaves
of
the
book
and
did
not
look
at
him
but
he
faltered
his
eyes
glowing
it
would
do
sweet
lad
do
she
cried
laughing
but
i
he
insisted
i
do
know
whether
i
should
like
any
girl
i
know
precious
sir
galahad
she
said
in
a
mock
caressing
voice
and
stroking
his
cheek
with
her
finger
you
ought
to
have
been
a
martyr
a
carthusian
he
laughed
taking
no
notice
he
was
breathlessly
quivering
under
the
new
sensation
of
heavy
unappeased
fire
in
his
breast
and
in
the
muscles
of
his
arms
he
glanced
at
her
bosom
and
shivered
are
you
studying
just
how
to
play
the
part
she
asked
he
tried
to
look
at
her
but
failed
he
shrank
laughing
and
dropped
his
head
what
she
asked
with
vibrant
curiosity
having
become
a
few
degrees
calmer
he
looked
up
at
her
now
his
eyes
wide
and
vivid
with
a
declaration
that
made
her
shrink
back
as
if
flame
had
leaped
towards
her
face
she
bent
down
her
head
and
picked
at
her
dress
did
you
know
the
picture
before
she
said
in
a
low
toneless
voice
he
shut
his
eyes
and
shrank
with
shame
no
i
never
seen
it
before
he
said
i
surprised
she
said
it
is
a
very
common
one
is
it
he
answered
and
this
conversation
fell
she
looked
up
and
found
his
eyes
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
moment
before
they
hid
their
faces
again
it
was
a
torture
to
each
of
them
to
look
thus
nakedly
at
the
other
a
dazzled
shrinking
pain
that
they
forced
themselves
to
undergo
for
a
moment
that
they
might
the
moment
after
tremble
with
a
fierce
sensation
that
filled
their
veins
with
fluid
fiery
electricity
she
sought
almost
in
panic
for
something
to
say
i
believe
it
in
liverpool
the
picture
she
contrived
to
say
he
dared
not
kill
this
conversation
he
was
too
he
forced
himself
to
reply
i
did
know
there
was
a
gallery
in
liverpool
oh
yes
a
very
good
one
she
said
their
eyes
met
in
the
briefest
flash
of
a
glance
then
both
turned
their
faces
aside
thus
averted
one
from
the
other
they
made
talk
at
last
she
rose
gathered
the
books
together
and
carried
them
off
at
the
door
she
turned
she
must
steal
another
keen
moment
are
you
admiring
my
strength
she
asked
her
pose
was
fine
with
her
head
thrown
back
the
roundness
of
her
throat
ran
finely
down
to
the
bosom
which
swelled
above
the
pile
of
books
held
by
her
straight
arms
he
looked
at
her
their
lips
smiled
curiously
she
put
back
her
throat
as
if
she
were
drinking
they
felt
the
blood
beating
madly
in
their
necks
then
suddenly
breaking
into
a
slight
trembling
she
turned
round
and
left
the
room
while
she
was
out
he
sat
twisting
his
moustache
she
came
back
along
the
hall
talking
madly
to
herself
in
french
having
been
much
impressed
by
sarah
bernhardt
dame
aux
camelias
and
adrienne
lecouvreur
lettie
had
caught
something
of
the
weird
tone
of
this
great
actress
and
her
raillery
and
mockery
came
out
in
little
wild
waves
she
laughed
at
him
and
at
herself
and
at
men
in
general
and
at
love
in
particular
whatever
he
said
to
her
she
answered
in
the
same
mad
clatter
of
french
speaking
high
and
harshly
the
sound
was
strange
and
uncomfortable
there
was
a
painful
perplexity
in
his
brow
such
as
i
often
perceived
afterwards
a
sense
of
something
hurting
something
he
could
not
understand
well
well
well
well
she
exclaimed
at
last
we
must
be
mad
sometimes
or
we
should
be
getting
aged
hein
i
wish
i
could
understand
he
said
plaintively
poor
dear
she
laughed
how
sober
he
is
and
will
you
really
go
they
will
think
we
given
you
no
supper
you
look
so
sad
i
have
he
began
his
eyes
dancing
with
a
smile
as
he
ventured
upon
a
quotation
he
was
very
much
excited
of
horrors
she
cried
completing
it
now
that
is
worse
than
anything
i
have
given
you
is
it
he
replied
and
they
smiled
at
each
other
far
worse
she
answered
they
waited
in
suspense
for
some
moments
he
looked
at
her
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
her
voice
was
full
of
insurgent
tenderness
he
looked
at
her
again
his
eyes
flickering
then
he
took
her
hand
she
pressed
his
fingers
holding
them
a
little
while
then
ashamed
of
her
display
of
feeling
she
looked
down
he
had
a
deep
cut
across
his
thumb
what
a
gash
she
exclaimed
shivering
and
clinging
a
little
tighter
to
his
fingers
before
she
released
them
he
gave
a
little
laugh
does
it
hurt
you
she
asked
very
gently
he
laughed
no
he
said
softly
as
if
his
thumb
were
not
worthy
of
consideration
they
smiled
again
at
each
other
and
with
a
blind
movement
he
broke
the
spell
and
was
gone
chapter
iv
the
father
autumn
set
in
and
the
red
dahlias
which
kept
the
warm
light
alive
in
their
bosoms
so
late
into
the
evening
died
in
the
night
and
the
morning
had
nothing
but
brown
balls
of
rottenness
to
show
they
called
me
as
i
passed
the
door
in
eberwich
one
evening
and
they
gave
me
a
letter
for
my
mother
the
distorted
sprawling
handwriting
perplexed
me
with
a
dim
uneasiness
i
put
the
letter
away
and
forgot
it
i
remembered
it
later
in
the
evening
when
i
wished
to
recall
something
to
interest
my
mother
she
looked
at
the
handwriting
and
began
hastily
and
nervously
to
tear
open
the
envelope
she
held
it
away
from
her
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
and
with
eyes
drawn
half
closed
tried
to
scan
it
so
i
found
her
spectacles
but
she
did
not
speak
her
thanks
and
her
hand
trembled
she
read
the
short
letter
quickly
then
she
sat
down
and
read
it
again
and
continued
to
look
at
it
what
is
it
mother
i
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
continued
staring
at
the
letter
i
went
up
to
her
and
put
my
hand
on
her
shoulder
feeling
very
uncomfortable
she
took
no
notice
of
me
beginning
to
murmur
poor
frank
that
was
my
father
name
but
what
is
it
mother
me
what
the
matter
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
stranger
she
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
then
she
left
the
room
and
i
heard
her
go
out
of
the
house
the
letter
had
fallen
on
to
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
the
handwriting
was
very
broken
the
address
gave
a
village
some
few
miles
away
the
date
was
three
days
before
my
dear
lettice
you
will
want
to
know
i
am
gone
i
can
hardly
last
a
day
or
kidneys
are
nearly
gone
i
came
over
one
day
i
did
see
you
but
i
saw
the
girl
by
the
window
and
i
had
a
few
words
with
the
lad
he
never
knew
and
he
felt
nothing
i
think
the
girl
might
have
done
if
you
knew
how
awfully
lonely
i
am
awfully
i
have
been
you
might
feel
sorry
i
have
saved
what
i
could
to
pay
you
back
i
have
had
the
worst
of
it
lettice
and
i
glad
the
end
has
come
i
have
had
the
worst
of
it
husband
frank
beardsall
i
was
numbed
by
this
letter
of
my
father
with
almost
agonised
effort
i
strove
to
recall
him
but
i
knew
that
my
image
of
a
tall
handsome
dark
man
with
pale
grey
eyes
was
made
up
from
my
mother
few
words
and
from
a
portrait
i
had
once
seen
the
marriage
had
been
unhappy
my
father
was
of
frivolous
rather
vulgar
character
but
plausible
having
a
good
deal
of
charm
he
was
a
liar
without
notion
of
honesty
and
he
had
deceived
my
mother
thoroughly
one
after
another
she
discovered
his
mean
dishonesties
and
deceits
and
her
soul
revolted
from
him
and
because
the
illusion
of
him
had
broken
into
a
thousand
vulgar
fragments
she
turned
away
with
the
scorn
of
a
woman
who
finds
her
romance
has
been
a
trumpery
tale
when
he
left
her
for
other
being
a
baby
of
three
years
while
i
was
rejoiced
bitterly
she
had
heard
of
him
of
him
nothing
good
although
he
he
had
never
come
to
see
her
or
written
to
her
in
all
the
eighteen
years
in
a
while
my
mother
came
in
she
sat
down
pleating
up
the
hem
of
her
black
apron
and
smoothing
it
out
again
you
know
she
said
he
had
a
right
to
the
children
and
i
kept
them
all
the
time
he
could
have
come
said
i
i
set
them
against
him
i
have
kept
them
from
him
and
he
wanted
them
i
ought
to
be
by
him
ought
to
have
taken
you
to
him
long
ago
but
how
could
you
when
you
knew
nothing
of
him
he
would
have
wanted
to
have
felt
it
for
years
but
i
kept
him
away
i
know
i
have
kept
him
away
i
have
felt
it
and
he
has
poor
see
his
mistakes
now
he
would
not
have
been
as
cruel
as
i
have
nay
mother
it
is
only
the
shock
that
makes
you
say
so
this
makes
me
know
i
have
felt
in
myself
a
long
time
that
he
was
suffering
i
have
had
the
feeling
of
him
in
me
i
knew
yes
i
did
know
he
wanted
me
and
you
i
felt
it
i
have
had
the
feeling
of
him
upon
me
this
last
three
months
especially
i
have
been
cruel
to
him
go
to
him
now
shall
we
i
said
she
replied
noticing
me
really
for
the
first
time
i
go
in
the
morning
and
i
go
with
you
the
morning
lettie
has
her
party
to
tell
wo
tell
her
no
said
i
shortly
after
my
mother
went
upstairs
lettie
came
in
rather
late
from
highclose
leslie
did
not
come
in
in
the
morning
they
were
going
with
a
motor
party
into
matloch
and
chatsworth
and
she
was
excited
and
did
not
observe
anything
after
all
mother
and
i
could
not
set
out
until
the
warm
tempered
afternoon
the
air
was
full
of
a
soft
yellowness
when
we
stepped
down
from
the
train
at
cossethay
my
mother
insisted
on
walking
the
long
two
miles
to
the
village
we
went
slowly
along
the
road
lingering
over
the
little
red
flowers
in
the
high
up
the
hillside
we
were
reluctant
to
come
to
our
destination
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
little
grey
tower
of
the
church
we
heard
the
sound
of
braying
brassy
music
before
us
filling
a
little
croft
the
wakes
was
in
full
swing
some
wooden
horses
careered
gaily
round
and
the
swingboats
leaped
into
the
mild
blue
sky
we
sat
upon
the
stile
my
mother
and
i
and
watched
there
were
booths
and
cocoanut
shies
and
scattered
in
the
small
field
groups
of
children
moved
quietly
from
attraction
to
attraction
a
deeply
tanned
man
came
across
the
field
swinging
two
dripping
buckets
of
water
women
looked
from
the
doors
of
their
brilliant
caravans
and
lean
dogs
rose
lazily
and
settled
down
again
under
the
steps
the
fair
moved
slowly
for
all
its
noise
a
stout
lady
with
a
husky
masculine
voice
invited
the
excited
children
into
her
peep
show
a
swarthy
man
stood
with
his
thin
legs
astride
on
the
platform
of
the
roundabouts
and
sloping
backwards
his
mouth
distended
with
a
row
of
fingers
he
whistled
astonishingly
to
the
coarse
row
of
the
organ
and
his
whistling
sounded
clear
like
the
flight
of
a
wild
goose
high
over
the
chimney
tops
as
he
was
carried
round
and
round
a
little
fat
man
with
an
ugly
swelling
on
his
chest
stood
screaming
from
a
filthy
booth
to
a
crowd
of
urchins
bidding
them
challenge
a
big
stolid
young
man
who
stood
with
folded
arms
his
fists
pushing
out
his
biceps
on
being
asked
if
he
would
undertake
any
of
these
prospective
challenges
this
young
man
nodded
not
having
yet
attained
a
talking
stage
he
would
take
two
at
a
time
screamed
the
little
fat
man
with
the
big
excrescence
on
his
chest
pointing
at
the
cowering
lads
and
girls
further
off
punch
quaint
voice
could
be
heard
when
the
cocoanut
man
ceased
grinding
out
screeches
from
his
rattle
the
cocoanut
man
was
wroth
for
these
youngsters
would
not
risk
a
penny
shy
and
the
rattle
yelled
like
a
fiend
a
little
girl
came
along
to
look
at
us
daintily
licking
an
sandwich
we
were
uninteresting
however
so
she
passed
on
to
stare
at
the
caravans
we
had
almost
gathered
courage
to
cross
the
wakes
when
the
cracked
bell
of
the
church
sent
its
note
falling
over
the
babble
it
really
sounded
three
then
it
rang
on
a
lower
a
passing
bell
for
a
man
i
looked
at
my
turned
away
from
me
the
organ
flared
husky
woman
came
forward
to
make
another
appeal
then
there
was
a
lull
the
man
with
the
lump
on
his
chest
had
gone
inside
the
rag
to
spar
with
the
solid
fellow
the
cocoanut
man
had
gone
to
the
three
tunns
in
fury
and
a
brazen
girl
of
seventeen
or
so
was
in
charge
of
the
nuts
the
horses
careered
round
carrying
two
frightened
boys
suddenly
the
quick
throbbing
note
of
the
low
bell
struck
again
through
the
din
i
could
not
keep
count
one
two
three
the
third
time
that
great
lad
had
determined
to
go
on
the
horses
and
they
had
started
while
his
foot
was
on
the
step
and
he
had
been
nine
wonder
that
whistling
man
had
such
a
big
adam
wondered
if
it
hurt
his
neck
when
he
talked
being
so
girl
was
licking
more
with
precious
tiny
wondered
if
i
did
count
to
mechanically
at
this
point
i
gave
it
up
and
watched
for
lord
tennyson
bald
head
to
come
spinning
round
on
the
painted
rim
of
the
followed
by
a
lord
roberts
and
a
villainous
looking
disraeli
said
my
mother
along
we
hurried
through
the
fair
towards
the
church
towards
a
garden
where
the
last
red
sentinels
looked
out
from
the
top
of
the
spires
the
garden
was
a
tousled
mass
of
faded
pink
chrysanthemums
and
michaelmas
daisies
and
spectre
stalks
of
it
belonged
to
a
low
dark
house
which
crouched
behind
a
screen
of
yews
we
walked
along
to
the
front
the
blinds
were
down
and
in
one
room
we
could
see
the
stale
light
of
candles
burning
is
this
yew
cottage
asked
my
mother
of
a
curious
lad

replied
the
boy

i
asked
she
french
he

letten

owd

we
went
to
the
house
and
knocked
an
ye
come
about
him
hoarsely
whispered
a
bent
old
woman
looking
up
with
very
blue
eyes
nodding
her
old
head
with
its
velvet
net
significantly
towards
the
inner
room
said
my
mother
we
had
a
letter
ay
poor
gone
missis
and
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
then
she
looked
at
us
curiously
leaned
forward
and
putting
her
withered
old
hand
on
my
mother
arm
her
hand
with
its
dark
blue
veins
she
whispered
in
confidence
and
the
candles
gone
out
twice

his

ancient
hands
and
looked
up
at
my
mother
with
her
eyes
so
intensely
blue
do
you

where
he
kept
his
papers

my
mother

and
again
she
shook
her
grey
head
mournfully
my
mother
took
a
step
forward
did
ye
want
to
see
asked
the
old
woman
with
half
timid
questioning
yes
replied
my
mother
with
a
vigorous
nod
she
perceived
now
that
the
old
lady
was
deaf
we
followed
the
woman
into
the
kitchen
a
long
low
room
dark
with
drawn
blinds
sit
ye
down
said
the
old
lady
in
the
same
low
tone
as
if
she
were
speaking
to
herself

his
sister
my
mother
shook
her
head
brother

persisted
the
old
lady
we
shook
our
heads
only
a
cousin
she
guessed
and
looked
at
us
appealingly
i
nodded
assent
sit
ye
there
a
minute
she
said
and
trotted
off
she
banged
the
door
and
jarred
a
chair
as
she
went
when
she
returned
she
set
down
a
bottle
and
two
glasses
with
a
thump
on
the
table
in
front
of
us
her
thin
skinny
wrist
seemed
hardly
capable
of
carrying
the
bottle
it
one
as
he
only
just
begun
a
drop
to
keep
ye
now
poor
thing
she
said
pushing
the
bottle
to
my
mother
and
hurrying
off
returning
with
the
sugar
and
the
kettle
we
refused
wo
want
it

we
refused
in
there
she
whispered
pointing
to
a
closed
door
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
gloomy
kitchen
i
stumbled
up
a
little
step
and
went
plunging
against
a
rickety
table
on
which
was
a
candle
in
a
tall
brass
candlestick
over
went
the
candle
and
it
rolled
on
the
floor
and
the
brass
holder
fell
with
much
clanging
eh
wailed
the
old
woman
she
hastened
trembling
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
relit
the
extinguished
candle
at
the
taper
which
was
still
burning
as
she
returned
the
light
glowed
on
her
old
wrinkled
face
and
on
the
burnished
knobs
of
the
dark
mahogany
bedstead
while
a
stream
of
wax
dripped
down
on
to
the
floor
by
the
glimmering
light
of
the
two
tapers
we
could
see
the
outlined
form
under
the
counterpane
she
turned
back
the
hem
and
began
to
make
painful
wailing
sounds
my
heart
was
beating
heavily
and
i
felt
choked
i
did
not
want
to
i
must
it
was
the
man
i
had
seen
in
the
the
puffiness
gone
from
his
face
i
felt
the
great
wild
pity
and
a
sense
of
terror
and
a
sense
of
horror
and
a
sense
of
awful
littleness
and
loneliness
among
a
great
empty
space
i
felt
beyond
myself
as
if
i
were
a
mere
fleck
drifting
unconsciously
through
the
dark
then
i
felt
my
mother
arm
round
my
shoulders
and
she
cried
pitifully
oh
my
son
my
son
i
shivered
and
came
back
to
myself
there
were
no
tears
in
my
face
only
a
great
pleading
never
mind
mind
i
said
incoherently
she
rose
and
covered
the
face
again
and
went
round
to
the
old
lady
and
held
her
still
and
stayed
her
little
wailings
the
woman
wiped
from
her
cheeks
the
few
tears
of
old
age
and
pushed
her
grey
hair
smooth
under
the
velvet
network
where
are
all
his
things
asked
mother
eh
said
the
old
lady
lifting
up
her
ear
are
all
his
things
here
repeated
mother
in
a
louder
tone
here
woman
waved
her
hand
round
the
room
it
contained
the
great
mahogany
bedstead
naked
of
hangings
a
desk
and
an
oak
chest
and
two
or
three
mahogany
chairs
i
could
get
him
upstairs
he
only
been
here
about
a
three
week
where
the
key
to
the
desk
said
my
mother
loudly
in
the
woman
ear
yes
she
it
his
desk
she
looked
at
us
perplexed
and
doubtful
fearing
she
had
misunderstood
us
this
was
dreadful
key
i
shouted
where
is
the
key
her
old
face
was
full
of
trouble
as
she
shook
her
head
i
took
it
that
she
did
not
know
where
are
his
clothes
i
repeated
pointing
to
my
coat
she
understood
and
muttered
i
fetch
ye
we
should
have
followed
her
as
she
hurried
upstairs
through
a
door
near
the
head
of
the
bed
had
we
not
heard
a
heavy
footstep
in
the
kitchen
and
a
voice
saying
is
the
old
lady
going
to
drink
with
the
devil
hullo
may
come
and
drink
with
me
we
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
liquor
poured
into
a
glass
and
almost
immediately
the
light
tap
of
the
empty
tumbler
on
the
table
i
see
what
the
old
girl
up
to
he
said
and
the
heavy
tread
came
towards
us
like
me
he
stumbled
at
the
little
step
but
escaped
collision
with
the
table
damn
that
fool
step
he
said
heartily
it
was
the
he
kept
his
hat
on
his
head
and
did
not
hesitate
to
stroll
about
the
house
he
was
a
big
burly
man
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
observing
my
mother
my
mother
bowed
mrs
beardsall
he
asked
taking
off
his
hat
my
mother
bowed
i
posted
a
letter
to
you
you
are
a
relative
of
poor
old
carlin
nodded
sideways
towards
the
bed
the
nearest
said
my
mother
poor
was
a
bit
stranded
comes
of
being
a
bachelor
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
hear
from
him
said
my
mother
yes
i
guess
he
not
been
much
of
a
one
for
writing
to
his
friends
he
had
a
bad
time
lately
you
have
to
pay
some
time
or
other
we
bring
them
on
devils
as
we
beg
your
pardon
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
the
doctor
sighed
and
then
began
to
whistle
softly
might
be
more
comfortable
if
we
had
the
blind
up
he
said
letting
daylight
in
among
the
glimmer
of
the
tapers
as
he
spoke
at
any
rate
he
said
you
wo
have
any
trouble
settling
debts
or
anything
of
that
i
believe
there
a
bit
to
it
not
so
bad
poor
was
very
down
at
the
last
but
we
have
to
pay
at
one
end
or
the
other
what
on
earth
is
the
old
girl
after
he
asked
looking
up
at
the
raftered
ceiling
which
was
rumbling
and
thundering
with
the
old
lady
violent
rummaging
we
wanted
the
key
of
his
desk
said
my
mother
can
find
you
the
will
he
told
me
where
they
were
and
to
give
them
you
when
you
came
he
seemed
to
think
a
lot
of
you
perhaps
he
might
ha
done
better
for
here
we
heard
the
heavy
tread
of
the
old
lady
coming
downstairs
the
doctor
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
hello
careful
he
bawled
the
poor
old
woman
did
as
he
expected
and
trod
on
the
braces
of
the
trousers
she
was
trailing
and
came
crashing
into
his
arms
he
set
her
tenderly
down
saying
not
hurt
are
you
and
he
smiled
at
her
and
shook
his
head
eh
ye
i
thankful
ye
come
ye
see
to
now
will
ye
he
nodded
in
his
bluff
winning
way
and
hurrying
into
the
kitchen
he
mixed
her
a
glass
of
whisky
and
brought
one
for
himself
saying
to
her
there
you
a
nasty
shaking
for
you
the
poor
old
woman
sat
in
a
chair
by
the
open
door
of
the
staircase
the
pile
of
clothing
tumbled
about
her
feet
she
looked
round
pitifully
at
us
and
at
the
daylight
struggling
among
the
candle
light
making
a
ghostly
gleam
on
the
bed
where
the
rigid
figure
lay
unmoved
her
hand
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
her
glass
the
doctor
gave
us
the
keys
and
we
rifled
the
desk
and
the
drawers
sorting
out
all
the
papers
the
doctor
sat
sipping
and
talking
to
us
all
the
time
yes
he
said
he
only
been
here
about
two
years
felt
himself
beginning
to
break
up
then
i
think
he
been
a
long
time
abroad
they
always
called
him
frenchy
the
doctor
sipped
and
reflected
and
sipped
again
run
the
rig
in
his
to
dream
dreadfully
good
thing
the
old
woman
was
so
deaf
awful
when
a
man
gives
himself
away
in
his
sleep
played
the
deuce
with
him
knowing
it
sip
sip
more
another
glass
to
be
mixed
but
he
was
a
jolly
decent
the
folks
did
like
him
because
they
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
him
they
always
hate
a
thing
they
ca
fathom
he
was
close
there
no
when
he
was
asleep
sometimes
the
doctor
looked
at
his
glass
and
sighed
shall
miss
we
mrs
may
he
bawled
suddenly
startling
us
making
us
glance
at
the
bed
he
lit
his
pipe
and
puffed
voluminously
in
order
to
obscure
the
attraction
of
his
glass
meanwhile
we
examined
the
papers
there
were
very
few
or
two
addressed
to
paris
there
were
many
bills
and
receipts
and
all
business
there
was
hardly
a
trace
of
sentiment
among
all
the
litter
my
mother
sorted
out
such
papers
as
she
considered
valuable
the
others
letters
and
missives
which
she
glanced
at
cursorily
and
put
aside
she
took
into
the
kitchen
and
burned
she
seemed
afraid
to
find
out
too
much
the
doctor
continued
to
colour
his
tobacco
smoke
with
a
few
pensive
words
ay
he
said
there
are
two
ways
you
can
burn
your
lamp
with
a
big
draught
and
it
flare
away
till
the
oil
gone
then
it
stink
and
smoke
itself
out
or
you
can
keep
it
trim
on
the
kitchen
table
dirty
your
fingers
occasionally
trimming
it
up
and
it
last
a
long
time
and
sink
out
mildly
here
he
turned
to
his
glass
and
finding
it
empty
was
awakened
to
reality
anything
i
can
do
madam
he
asked
no
thank
you
ay
i
do
suppose
there
much
to
settle
nor
many
tears
to
a
fellow
spends
his
years
an
his
prime
on
the
lord
knows
who
you
ca
expect
those
that
remember
him
young
to
feel
his
loss
too
keenly
he
had
his
fling
in
his
day
though
ha
had
some
rich
times
no
lasting
satisfaction
in
it
wanting
craving
there
nothing
like
got
your
dish
before
you
then
and
you
got
to
eat
it
he
lapsed
again
into
reflection
from
which
he
did
not
rouse
till
we
had
locked
up
the
desk
burned
the
useless
papers
put
the
others
into
my
pockets
and
the
black
bag
and
were
standing
ready
to
depart
then
the
doctor
looked
up
suddenly
and
said
but
what
about
the
funeral
then
he
noticed
the
weariness
of
my
mother
look
and
he
jumped
up
and
quickly
seized
his
hat
saying
come
across
to
my
wife
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
buried
in
these
dam
holes
a
fellow
gets
such
a
boor
do
little
wife
is
just
to
see
her
my
mother
smiled
and
thanked
him
we
turned
to
go
my
mother
hesitated
in
her
walk
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
she
glanced
round
at
the
bed
but
she
went
on
outside
in
the
fresh
air
of
the
fading
afternoon
i
could
not
believe
it
was
true
it
was
not
true
that
sad
colourless
face
with
grey
beard
wavering
in
the
yellow
it
was
a
lie
wooden
bedstead
that
deaf
woman
they
were
fading
phrases
of
the
untruth
that
yellow
blaze
of
little
sunflowers
was
true
and
the
shadow
from
the
on
the
warm
old
was
real
the
heavy
afternoon
sunlight
came
round
us
warm
and
reviving
we
shivered
and
the
untruth
went
out
of
our
veins
and
we
were
no
longer
chilled
the
doctor
house
stood
sweetly
among
the
beech
trees
and
at
the
iron
fence
in
front
of
the
little
lawn
a
woman
was
talking
to
a
beautiful
jersey
cow
that
pushed
its
dark
nose
through
the
fence
from
the
field
beyond
she
was
a
little
dark
woman
with
vivid
colouring
she
rubbed
the
nose
of
the
delicate
animal
peeped
right
into
the
dark
eyes
and
talked
in
a
lovable
scottish
speech
talked
as
a
mother
talks
softly
to
her
child
when
she
turned
round
in
surprise
to
greet
us
there
was
still
the
softness
of
a
rich
affection
in
her
eyes
she
gave
us
tea
and
scones
and
apply
jelly
and
all
the
time
we
listened
with
delight
to
her
voice
which
was
musical
as
bees
humming
in
the
lime
trees
though
she
said
nothing
significant
we
listened
to
her
attentively
her
husband
was
merry
and
kind
she
glanced
at
him
with
quick
glances
of
apprehension
and
her
eyes
avoided
him
he
in
his
merry
frank
way
chaffed
her
and
praised
her
extravagantly
and
teased
her
again
then
he
became
a
trifle
uneasy
i
think
she
was
afraid
he
had
been
drinking
i
think
she
was
shaken
with
horror
when
she
found
him
tipsy
and
bewildered
and
terrified
when
she
saw
him
drunk
they
had
no
children
i
noticed
he
ceased
to
joke
when
she
became
a
little
constrained
he
glanced
at
her
often
and
looked
somewhat
pitiful
when
she
avoided
his
looks
and
he
grew
uneasy
and
i
could
see
he
wanted
to
go
away
i
had
better
go
with
you
to
see
the
vicar
then
he
said
to
me
and
we
left
the
room
whose
windows
looked
south
over
the
meadows
the
room
where
dainty
little
and
beautiful
bits
of
embroidery
and
empty
flower
vases
and
two
dirty
novels
from
the
town
library
and
the
closed
piano
and
the
odd
cups
and
the
chipped
spout
of
the
teapot
causing
stains
on
the
told
one
story
we
went
to
the
joiner
and
ordered
the
coffin
and
the
doctor
had
a
glass
of
whisky
on
it
the
graveyard
fees
were
paid
and
the
doctor
sealed
the
engagement
with
a
drop
of
brandy
the
vicar
port
completed
the
doctor
joviality
and
we
went
home
this
time
the
disquiet
in
the
little
woman
dark
eyes
could
not
dispel
the
doctor
merriment
he
rattled
away
and
she
nervously
twisted
her
wedding
ring
he
insisted
on
driving
us
to
the
station
in
spite
of
our
alarm
but
you
will
be
quite
safe
with
him
said
his
wife
in
her
caressing
highland
speech
when
she
shook
hands
at
parting
i
noticed
the
hardness
of
the
little
palm
i
have
always
hated
an
old
black
alpaca
dress
it
is
such
a
long
way
home
from
the
station
at
eberwich
we
rode
part
way
in
the
bus
then
we
walked
it
is
a
very
long
way
for
my
mother
when
her
steps
are
heavy
with
trouble
rebecca
was
out
by
the
rhododendrons
looking
for
us
she
hurried
to
us
all
solicitous
and
asked
mother
if
she
had
had
tea
but
you
do
with
another
cup
she
said
and
ran
back
into
the
house
she
came
into
the
to
take
my
mother
bonnet
and
coat
she
wanted
us
to
talk
she
was
distressed
on
my
mother
behalf
she
noticed
the
blackness
that
lay
under
her
eyes
and
she
fidgeted
about
unwilling
to
ask
anything
yet
uneasy
and
anxious
to
know
lettie
has
been
home
she
said
and
gone
back
again
asked
mother
she
only
came
to
change
her
dress
she
put
the
green
poplin
on
she
wondered
where
you
gone
what
did
you
tell
her
i
said
you
just
gone
out
a
bit
she
said
she
was
glad
she
was
as
lively
as
a
squirrel
rebecca
looked
wistfully
at
my
mother
at
length
the
latter
said
he
dead
rebecca
i
have
seen
him
now
thank
god
for
more
need
to
worry
over
him
well
died
all
alone
alone
he
died
as
you
lived
said
becky
with
some
asperity
but
i
had
the
children
i
had
the
wo
tell
lettie
rebecca
no
rebecca
left
the
room
you
and
lettie
will
have
the
money
said
mother
to
me
there
was
a
sum
of
four
thousand
pounds
or
so
it
was
left
to
my
mother
or
in
default
to
lettie
and
me
well
it
ours
it
yours
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
then
she
said
you
might
have
had
a
we
thankful
we
had
mother
you
spared
us
that
but
how
can
you
tell
said
my
mother
i
can
i
replied
and
i
am
thankful
to
you
if
ever
you
feel
scorn
for
one
who
is
near
you
rising
in
your
throat
try
and
be
generous
my
lad
said
i
yes
she
replied
we
say
no
more
sometime
you
must
tell
tell
her
i
did
tell
her
a
week
or
so
afterwards
who
knows
she
asked
her
face
hardening
mother
becky
and
ourselves
nobody
else
no
then
it
a
good
thing
he
is
out
of
the
way
if
he
was
such
a
nuisance
to
mother
where
is
she
upstairs
lettie
ran
to
her
chapter
v
the
scent
of
blood
the
death
of
the
man
who
was
our
father
changed
our
lives
it
was
not
that
we
suffered
a
great
grief
the
chief
trouble
was
the
unanswered
crying
of
failure
but
we
were
changed
in
our
feelings
and
in
our
relations
there
was
a
new
consciousness
a
new
carefulness
we
had
lived
between
the
woods
and
the
water
all
our
lives
lettie
and
i
and
she
had
sought
the
bright
notes
in
everything
she
seemed
to
hear
the
water
laughing
and
the
leaves
tittering
and
giggling
like
young
girls
the
aspen
fluttered
like
the
draperies
of
a
flirt
and
the
sound
of
the
was
almost
foolish
in
its
sentimentality
lately
however
she
had
noticed
again
the
cruel
pitiful
crying
of
a
hedgehog
caught
in
a
gin
and
she
had
noticed
the
traps
for
the
fierce
little
murderers
traps
walled
in
with
a
small
fence
of
fir
and
baited
with
the
guts
of
a
killed
rabbit
on
an
afternoon
a
short
time
after
our
visit
to
cossethay
lettie
sat
in
the
window
seat
the
sun
clung
to
her
hair
and
kissed
her
with
passionate
splashes
of
colour
brought
from
the
vermilion
dying
creeper
outside
the
sun
loved
lettie
and
was
loath
to
leave
her
she
looked
out
over
nethermere
to
highclose
vague
in
the
september
mist
had
it
not
been
for
the
scarlet
light
on
her
face
i
should
have
thought
her
look
was
sad
and
serious
she
nestled
up
to
the
window
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
wooden
shaft
gradually
she
drooped
into
sleep
then
she
became
wonderfully
childish
was
the
girl
of
seventeen
sleeping
there
with
her
full
pouting
lips
slightly
apart
and
the
breath
coming
lightly
i
felt
the
old
feeling
of
responsibility
i
must
protect
her
and
take
care
of
her
there
was
a
crunch
of
the
gravel
it
was
leslie
coming
he
lifted
his
hat
to
her
thinking
she
was
looking
he
had
that
fine
lithe
physique
suggestive
of
much
animal
vigour
his
person
was
exceedingly
attractive
one
watched
him
move
about
and
felt
pleasure
his
face
was
less
pleasing
than
his
person
he
was
not
handsome
his
eyebrows
were
too
light
his
nose
was
large
and
ugly
and
his
forehead
though
high
and
fair
was
without
dignity
but
he
had
a
frank
expression
and
a
fine
wholesome
laugh
he
wondered
why
she
did
not
move
as
he
came
nearer
he
saw
then
he
winked
at
me
and
came
in
he
tiptoed
across
the
room
to
look
at
her
the
sweet
carelessness
of
her
attitude
the
appealing
girlishness
of
her
face
touched
his
responsive
heart
and
he
leaned
forward
and
kissed
her
cheek
where
already
was
a
crimson
stain
of
sunshine
she
roused
half
out
of
her
sleep
with
a
little
petulant
oh
as
an
awakened
child
he
sat
down
behind
her
and
gently
drew
her
head
against
him
looking
down
at
her
with
a
tender
soothing
smile
i
thought
she
was
going
to
fall
asleep
thus
but
her
eyelids
quivered
and
her
eyes
beneath
them
flickered
into
consciousness
leslie
me
go
she
exclaimed
pushing
him
away
he
loosed
her
and
rose
looking
at
her
reproachfully
she
shook
her
dress
and
went
quickly
to
the
mirror
to
arrange
her
hair
you
are
mean
she
exclaimed
looking
very
flushed
vexed
and
dishevelled
he
laughed
indulgently
saying
you
should
go
to
sleep
then
and
look
so
pretty
who
could
help
it
is
not
nice
she
said
frowning
with
irritation
we
are
not
we
i
thought
we
were
proud
of
our
unconventionality
why
should
i
kiss
you
because
it
is
a
question
of
me
not
of
you
alone
dear
me
you
in
a
way
mother
is
coming
is
she
you
had
better
tell
her
mother
was
very
fond
of
leslie
well
sir
she
said
why
are
you
frowning
he
broke
into
a
laugh
lettie
is
scolding
me
for
kissing
her
when
she
was
playing
beauty
the
conceit
of
the
boy
to
play
prince
said
my
mother
oh
but
it
appears
i
was
sadly
out
of
character
he
said
ruefully
lettie
laughed
and
forgave
him
well
he
said
looking
at
her
and
smiling
i
came
to
ask
you
to
go
out
it
is
a
lovely
afternoon
said
mother
she
glanced
at
him
and
said
i
feel
dreadfully
lazy
never
mind
he
replied
you
wake
up
go
and
put
your
hat
on
he
sounded
impatient
she
looked
at
him
he
seemed
to
be
smiling
peculiarly
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
went
out
of
the
room
she
come
all
right
he
said
to
himself
and
to
me
she
likes
to
play
you
on
a
string
she
must
have
heard
him
when
she
came
in
again
drawing
on
her
gloves
she
said
quietly
you
come
as
well
pat
he
swung
round
and
stared
at
her
in
angry
amazement
i
had
rather
stay
and
finish
this
sketch
i
said
feeling
uncomfortable
no
but
do
come
there
a
dear
she
took
the
brush
from
my
hand
and
drew
me
from
my
chair
the
blood
flushed
into
his
cheeks
he
went
quietly
into
the
hall
and
brought
my
cap
all
right
he
said
angrily
women
like
to
fancy
themselves
napoleons
they
do
dear
iron
duke
they
do
she
mocked
yet
there
a
waterloo
in
all
their
histories
he
said
since
she
had
supplied
him
with
the
idea
say
peterloo
my
general
say
peterloo
ay
peterloo
he
replied
with
a
splendid
curl
of
the
easy
conquests
came
he
saw
he
conquered
lettie
recited
are
you
coming
he
said
getting
more
angry
when
you
bid
me
she
replied
taking
my
arm
we
went
through
the
wood
and
through
the
dishevelled
to
the
high
road
through
the
that
should
have
been
but
which
was
shaggy
with
loose
grass
and
yellow
ragged
with
gorse
and
bramble
and
briar
with
wandering
old
and
a
queer
clump
of
scotch
firs
on
the
highway
the
leaves
were
falling
and
they
chattered
under
our
steps
the
water
was
mild
and
blue
and
the
corn
stood
drowsily
in
stook
we
climbed
the
hill
behind
highclose
and
walked
on
along
the
upland
looking
across
towards
the
hills
of
arid
derbyshire
and
seeing
them
not
because
it
was
autumn
we
came
in
sight
of
the
of
the
pit
at
selsby
and
of
the
ugly
village
standing
blank
and
naked
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
lettie
was
in
very
high
spirits
she
laughed
and
joked
continually
she
picked
bunches
of
hips
and
stuck
them
in
her
dress
having
got
a
thorn
in
her
finger
from
a
spray
of
blackberries
she
went
to
leslie
to
have
it
squeezed
out
we
were
all
quite
gay
as
we
turned
off
the
high
road
and
went
along
the
bridle
path
with
the
woods
on
our
right
the
high
strelley
hills
shutting
in
our
small
valley
in
front
and
the
fields
and
the
common
to
the
left
about
half
way
down
the
lane
we
heard
the
slurr
of
the
scythestone
on
the
scythe
lettie
went
to
the
hedge
to
see
it
was
george
mowing
the
oats
on
the
steep
hillside
where
the
machine
could
not
go
his
father
was
tying
up
the
corn
into
sheaves
straightening
his
back
saxton
saw
us
and
called
to
us
to
come
and
help
we
pushed
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
and
went
up
to
him
now
then
said
the
father
to
me
take
that
coat
off
and
to
lettie
have
you
brought
us
a
drink
no
that
sounds
bad
going
a
walk
i
guess
you
see
what
it
is
to
get
fat
and
he
pulled
a
wry
face
as
he
bent
over
to
tie
the
corn
he
was
a
man
beautifully
ruddy
and
burly
in
the
prime
of
life
show
me
i
do
some
said
lettie
nay
he
answered
gently
it
would
scratch
your
wrists
and
break
your
stays
hark
at
my
hands
rubbed
them
like
sandpaper
george
had
his
back
to
us
and
had
not
noticed
us
he
continued
to
mow
leslie
watched
him
that
a
fine
movement
he
exclaimed
yes
replied
the
father
rising
very
red
in
the
face
from
the
tying
and
our
george
enjoys
a
bit
o
mowing
it
puts
you
in
fine
condition
when
you
get
over
the
first
stiffness
we
moved
across
to
the
standing
corn
the
sun
being
mild
george
had
thrown
off
his
hat
and
his
black
hair
was
moist
and
twisted
into
confused
firmly
planted
he
swung
with
a
beautiful
rhythm
from
the
waist
on
the
hip
of
his
belted
breeches
hung
the
scythestone
his
shirt
faded
almost
white
was
torn
just
above
the
belt
and
showed
the
muscles
of
his
back
playing
like
lights
upon
the
white
sand
of
a
brook
there
was
something
exceedingly
attractive
in
the
rhythmic
body
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
turned
round
he
looked
straight
at
lettie
with
a
flashing
betraying
smile
he
was
remarkably
handsome
he
tried
to
say
some
words
of
greeting
then
he
bent
down
and
gathered
an
armful
of
corn
and
deliberately
bound
it
up
like
him
lettie
had
found
nothing
to
say
leslie
however
remarked
i
should
think
mowing
is
a
nice
exercise
it
is
he
replied
and
continued
as
leslie
picked
up
the
scythe
but
it
will
make
you
sweat
and
your
hands
will
be
sore
leslie
tossed
his
head
a
little
threw
off
his
coat
and
said
briefly
how
do
you
do
it
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
proceeded
george
said
nothing
but
turned
to
lettie
you
are
picturesque
she
said
a
trifle
awkwardly
quite
fit
for
an
idyll
and
you
he
said
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
laughed
and
turned
to
pick
up
a
scarlet
pimpernel
how
do
you
bind
the
corn
she
asked
he
took
some
long
straws
cleaned
them
and
showed
her
the
way
to
hold
them
instead
of
attending
she
looked
at
his
hands
big
hard
inflamed
by
the
snaith
of
the
scythe
i
do
think
i
could
do
it
she
said
no
he
replied
quietly
and
watched
leslie
mowing
the
latter
who
was
wonderfully
ready
at
everything
was
doing
fairly
well
but
he
had
not
the
invincible
sweep
of
the
other
nor
did
he
make
the
same
crisp
crunching
music
i
bet
he
sweat
said
george
do
you
she
replied
a
i
not
dressed
up
do
you
know
she
said
suddenly
your
arms
tempt
me
to
touch
them
they
are
such
a
fine
brown
colour
and
they
look
so
hard
he
held
out
one
arm
to
her
she
hesitated
then
she
swiftly
put
her
finger
tips
on
the
smooth
brown
muscle
and
drew
them
along
quickly
she
hid
her
hand
into
the
folds
of
her
skirt
blushing
he
laughed
a
low
quiet
laugh
at
once
pleasant
and
startling
to
hear
i
wish
i
could
work
here
she
said
looking
away
at
the
standing
corn
and
the
dim
blue
woods
he
followed
her
look
and
laughed
quietly
with
indulgent
resignation
i
do
she
said
emphatically
you
feel
so
fine
he
said
pushing
his
hand
through
his
open
shirt
front
and
gently
rubbing
the
muscles
of
his
side
it
a
pleasure
to
work
or
to
stand
still
it
a
pleasure
to
own
physique
she
looked
at
him
full
at
his
physical
beauty
as
if
he
were
some
great
firm
bud
of
life
leslie
came
up
wiping
his
brow
jove
said
he
i
do
perspire
george
picked
up
his
coat
and
helped
him
into
it
saying
you
may
take
a
chill
it
a
jolly
nice
form
of
exercise
said
he
george
who
had
been
feeling
one
finger
tip
now
took
out
his
and
proceeded
to
dig
a
thorn
from
his
hand
what
a
hide
you
must
have
said
leslie
lettie
said
nothing
but
she
recoiled
slightly
the
father
glad
of
an
excuse
to
straighten
his
back
and
to
chat
came
to
us
you
soon
had
enough
he
said
laughing
to
leslie
george
startled
us
with
a
sudden
holloa
we
turned
and
saw
a
rabbit
which
had
burst
from
the
corn
go
coursing
through
the
hedge
dodging
and
bounding
the
sheaves
the
standing
corn
was
a
patch
along
the
some
fifty
paces
in
length
and
ten
or
so
in
width
i
did
think
there
have
been
any
in
said
the
father
picking
up
a
short
rake
and
going
to
the
low
wall
of
the
corn
we
all
followed
watch
said
the
father
if
you
see
the
heads
of
the
corn
shake
we
prowled
round
the
patch
of
corn
hold
look
out
shouted
the
father
excitedly
and
immediately
after
a
rabbit
broke
from
the
cover
was
the
shout
turn
him
we
set
off
full
pelt
the
bewildered
little
brute
scared
by
leslie
wild
running
and
crying
turned
from
its
course
and
dodged
across
the
hill
threading
its
terrified
course
through
the
maze
of
lying
sheaves
spurting
on
in
a
painful
zigzag
now
bounding
over
an
untied
bundle
of
corn
now
swerving
from
the
sound
of
a
shout
the
little
wretch
was
hard
pressed
george
rushed
upon
it
it
darted
into
some
fallen
corn
but
he
had
seen
it
and
had
fallen
on
it
in
an
instant
he
was
up
again
and
the
little
creature
was
dangling
from
his
hand
we
returned
panting
sweating
our
eyes
flashing
to
the
edge
of
the
standing
corn
i
heard
lettie
calling
and
turning
round
saw
emily
and
the
two
children
entering
the
field
as
they
passed
from
school
there
another
shouted
leslie
i
saw
the
quiver
here
here
i
yelled
the
animal
leaped
out
and
made
for
the
hedge
george
and
leslie
who
were
on
that
side
dashed
off
turned
him
and
he
coursed
back
our
way
i
headed
him
off
to
the
father
who
swept
in
pursuit
for
a
short
distance
but
who
was
too
heavy
for
the
work
the
little
beast
made
towards
the
gate
but
this
time
mollie
with
her
hat
in
her
hand
and
her
hair
flying
whirled
upon
him
and
she
and
the
little
fragile
lad
sent
him
back
again
the
rabbit
was
getting
tired
it
dodged
the
sheaves
badly
running
towards
the
top
hedge
i
went
after
it
if
i
could
have
let
myself
fall
on
it
i
could
have
caught
it
but
this
was
impossible
to
me
and
i
merely
prevented
its
dashing
through
the
hole
into
safety
it
raced
along
the
hedge
bottom
george
tore
after
it
as
he
was
upon
it
it
darted
into
the
hedge
he
fell
flat
and
shot
his
hand
into
the
gap
but
it
had
escaped
he
lay
there
panting
in
great
sobs
and
looking
at
me
with
eyes
in
which
excitement
and
exhaustion
struggled
like
flickering
light
and
darkness
when
he
could
speak
he
said
why
did
you
fall
on
top
of
it
i
could
said
i
we
returned
again
the
two
children
were
peering
into
the
thick
corn
also
we
thought
there
was
nothing
more
george
began
to
mow
as
i
walked
round
i
caught
sight
of
a
rabbit
skulking
near
the
bottom
corner
of
the
patch
its
ears
lay
pressed
against
its
back
i
could
see
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
under
the
brown
fur
and
i
could
see
the
shining
dark
eyes
looking
at
me
i
felt
no
pity
for
it
but
still
i
could
not
actually
hurt
it
i
beckoned
to
the
father
he
ran
up
and
aimed
a
blow
with
the
rake
there
was
a
sharp
little
cry
which
sent
a
hot
pain
through
me
as
if
i
had
been
cut
but
the
rabbit
ran
out
and
instantly
i
forgot
the
cry
and
gave
pursuit
fairly
feeling
my
fingers
stiffen
to
choke
it
it
was
all
lame
leslie
was
upon
it
in
a
moment
and
he
almost
pulled
its
head
off
in
his
excitement
to
kill
it
i
looked
up
the
girls
were
at
the
gate
just
turning
away
there
are
no
more
said
the
father
at
that
instant
mary
shouted
there
one
down
this
hole
the
hole
was
too
small
for
george
to
get
his
hand
in
so
we
dug
it
out
with
the
rake
handle
the
stick
went
savagely
down
the
hole
and
there
came
a
squeak
mice
said
george
and
as
he
said
it
the
mother
slid
out
somebody
knocked
her
on
the
back
and
the
hole
was
opened
out
little
mice
seemed
to
swarm
everywhere
it
was
like
killing
insects
we
counted
nine
little
ones
lying
dead
poor
brute
said
george
looking
at
the
mother
what
a
job
she
must
have
had
rearing
that
lot
he
picked
her
up
handled
her
curiously
and
with
pity
then
he
said
well
i
may
as
well
finish
this
his
father
took
another
scythe
from
off
the
hedge
and
together
they
soon
laid
the
proud
quivering
heads
low
leslie
and
i
tied
up
as
they
mowed
and
soon
all
was
finished
the
beautiful
day
was
flushing
to
die
over
in
the
west
the
mist
was
gathering
bluer
the
intense
stillness
was
broken
by
the
rhythmic
hum
of
the
engines
at
the
distant
as
they
drew
up
the
last
bantles
of
men
as
we
walked
across
the
fields
the
tubes
of
stubble
tinkled
like
dulcimers
the
scent
of
the
corn
began
to
rise
gently
the
last
cry
of
the
pheasants
came
from
the
wood
and
the
little
clouds
of
birds
were
gone
i
carried
a
scythe
and
we
walked
pleasantly
weary
down
the
hill
towards
the
farm
the
children
had
gone
home
with
the
rabbits
when
we
reached
the
mill
we
found
the
girls
just
rising
from
the
table
emily
began
to
carry
away
the
used
pots
and
to
set
clean
ones
for
us
she
merely
glanced
at
us
and
said
her
formal
greeting
lettie
picked
up
a
book
that
lay
in
the
ingle
seat
and
went
to
the
window
george
dropped
into
a
chair
he
had
flung
off
his
coat
and
had
pushed
back
his
hair
he
rested
his
great
brown
arms
on
the
table
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
running
like
that
he
said
to
me
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
makes
you
more
tired
than
a
whole
day
work
i
do
think
i
shall
do
it
again
the
sport
exciting
while
it
lasts
said
leslie
it
does
you
more
harm
than
the
rabbits
do
us
good
said
saxton
oh
i
do
know
mother
drawled
her
son
it
a
couple
of
shillings
and
a
couple
of
days
off
your
life
what
be
that
he
replied
taking
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
biting
a
large
piece
from
it
pour
us
a
drop
of
tea
he
said
to
emily
i
do
know
that
i
shall
wait
on
such
brutes
she
replied
relenting
and
flourishing
the
teapot
oh
said
he
taking
another
piece
of
bread
and
butter
i
not
all
alone
in
my
savageness
this
time
men
are
all
brutes
said
lettie
hotly
without
looking
up
from
her
book
you
can
tame
us
said
leslie
in
mighty
good
humour
she
did
not
reply
george
began
in
that
deliberate
voice
that
so
annoyed
emily
it
does
make
you
mad
though
to
touch
the
fur
and
not
be
able
to
grab
him
laughed
quietly
emily
moved
off
in
disgust
lettie
opened
her
mouth
sharply
to
speak
but
remained
silent
i
do
know
said
leslie
when
it
comes
to
killing
it
goes
against
the
stomach
if
you
can
run
said
george
you
should
be
able
to
run
to
death
when
your
blood
up
you
do
hang
half
way
i
think
a
man
is
horrible
said
lettie
who
can
tear
the
head
off
a
little
mite
of
a
thing
like
a
rabbit
after
running
it
in
torture
over
a
field
when
he
is
nothing
but
a
barbarian
to
begin
said
emily
if
you
began
to
run
be
the
same
said
george
why
women
are
cruel
enough
said
leslie
with
a
glance
at
lettie
yes
he
continued
they
cruel
enough
in
their
way
look
and
a
comical
little
smile
well
said
george
what
the
good
finicking
if
you
feel
like
doing
a
better
do
it
unless
you
have
courage
said
emily
bitingly
he
looked
up
at
her
with
dark
eyes
suddenly
full
of
anger
but
said
could
not
hold
herself
from
asking
do
you
think
it
brutal
you
it
degrading
and
mean
to
run
the
poor
little
things
down
perhaps
it
is
he
replied
but
it
was
an
hour
ago
you
have
no
feeling
she
said
bitterly
he
laughed
deprecatingly
but
said
nothing
we
finished
tea
in
silence
lettie
reading
emily
moving
about
the
house
george
got
up
and
went
out
at
the
end
a
moment
or
two
after
we
heard
him
across
the
yard
with
the
singing
the
ash
grove
he
does
care
a
scrap
for
anything
said
emily
with
accumulated
bitterness
lettie
looked
out
of
the
window
across
the
yard
thinking
she
looked
very
glum
after
a
while
we
went
out
also
before
the
light
faded
altogether
from
the
pond
emily
took
us
into
the
lower
garden
to
get
some
ripe
plums
the
old
garden
was
very
low
the
soil
was
black
the
cornbind
and
goosegrass
were
clutching
at
the
ancient
gooseberry
bushes
which
sprawled
by
the
paths
the
garden
was
not
very
productive
save
of
weeds
and
perhaps
tremendous
lank
artichokes
or
swollen
marrows
but
at
the
bottom
where
the
end
of
the
farm
buildings
rose
high
and
grey
there
was
a
which
had
been
crucified
to
the
wall
and
which
had
broken
away
and
leaned
forward
from
bondage
now
under
the
boughs
were
hidden
great
crimson
treasures
splendid
globes
i
shook
the
old
ragged
trunk
green
with
even
the
fresh
gum
dulled
over
and
the
treasures
fell
heavily
thudding
down
among
the
immense
rhubarb
leaves
below
the
girls
laughed
and
we
divided
the
spoil
and
turned
back
to
the
yard
we
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
garden
which
skirted
the
bottom
pond
a
pool
chained
in
a
heavy
growth
of
weeds
it
was
moving
with
rats
the
father
had
said
the
rushes
were
thick
below
us
opposite
the
great
bank
fronted
us
with
orchard
trees
climbing
it
like
a
hillside
the
lower
pond
received
the
overflow
from
the
upper
by
a
tunnel
from
the
deep
black
sluice
two
rats
ran
into
the
black
culvert
at
our
approach
we
sat
on
some
piled
mossy
stones
to
watch
the
rats
came
out
again
ran
a
little
way
stopped
ran
again
listened
were
reassured
and
slid
about
freely
dragging
their
long
naked
tails
soon
six
or
seven
grey
beasts
were
playing
round
the
mouth
of
the
culvert
in
the
gloom
they
sat
and
wiped
their
sharp
faces
stroking
their
whiskers
then
one
would
give
a
little
rush
and
a
little
squirm
of
excitement
and
would
jump
vertically
into
the
air
alighting
on
four
feet
running
sliding
into
the
black
shadow
one
dropped
with
an
ugly
plop
into
the
water
and
swam
toward
us
the
hoary
imp
his
sharp
snout
and
his
wicked
little
eyes
moving
at
us
lettie
shuddered
i
threw
a
stone
into
the
dead
pool
and
frightened
them
all
but
we
had
frightened
ourselves
more
so
we
hurried
away
and
stamped
our
feet
in
relief
on
the
free
pavement
of
the
yard
leslie
was
looking
for
us
he
had
been
inspecting
the
yard
and
the
stock
under
saxton
supervision
were
you
running
away
from
me
he
asked
no
she
replied
i
have
been
to
fetch
you
a
plum
look
and
she
showed
him
two
in
a
leaf
they
are
too
pretty
to
eat
said
he
you
have
not
tasted
yet
she
laughed
come
he
said
offering
her
his
arm
let
us
go
up
to
the
water
she
took
his
arm
it
was
a
splendid
evening
with
the
light
all
thick
and
yellow
lying
on
the
smooth
pond
lettie
made
him
lift
her
on
to
a
leaning
bough
of
willow
he
sat
with
his
head
resting
against
her
skirts
emily
and
i
moved
on
we
heard
him
murmur
something
and
her
voice
reply
gently
caressingly
us
be
is
all
so
love
it
best
of
all
now
emily
and
i
talked
sitting
at
the
base
of
the
alders
a
little
way
on
after
an
excitement
and
in
the
evening
especially
in
autumn
one
is
inclined
to
be
sad
and
sentimental
we
had
forgotten
that
the
darkness
was
weaving
i
heard
in
the
little
distance
leslie
voice
begin
to
murmur
like
a
flying
beetle
that
comes
not
too
near
then
away
down
in
the
yard
george
began
singing
the
old
song
i
sowed
the
seeds
of
love
this
interrupted
the
flight
of
leslie
voice
and
as
the
singing
came
nearer
the
hum
of
low
words
ceased
we
went
forward
to
meet
george
leslie
sat
up
clasping
his
knees
and
did
not
speak
george
came
near
saying
the
moon
is
going
to
rise
let
me
get
down
said
lettie
lifting
her
hands
to
him
to
help
her
he
mistaking
her
wish
put
his
hands
under
her
arms
and
set
her
gently
down
as
one
would
a
child
leslie
got
up
quickly
and
seemed
to
hold
himself
separate
resenting
the
intrusion
i
thought
you
were
all
four
together
said
george
quietly
lettie
turned
quickly
at
the
apology
so
we
were
so
we
now
is
it
there
the
moon
will
rise
like
to
see
it
come
over
the
wood
it
lifts
slowly
up
to
stare
at
you
i
always
think
it
wants
to
know
something
and
i
always
think
i
have
something
to
answer
only
i
do
know
what
it
is
said
emily
where
the
sky
was
pale
in
the
east
over
the
rim
of
wood
came
the
forehead
of
the
yellow
moon
we
stood
and
watched
in
silence
then
as
the
great
disc
nearly
full
lifted
and
looked
straight
upon
us
we
were
washed
off
our
feet
in
a
vague
sea
of
moonlight
we
stood
with
the
light
like
water
on
our
faces
lettie
was
glad
a
little
bit
exalted
emily
was
passionately
troubled
her
lips
were
parted
almost
beseeching
leslie
was
frowning
oblivious
and
george
was
thinking
and
the
terrible
immense
moonbeams
braided
through
his
feeling
at
length
leslie
said
softly
mistakenly
come
along
dear
he
took
her
arm
she
let
him
lead
her
along
the
bank
of
the
pond
and
across
the
plank
over
the
sluice
do
you
know
she
said
as
we
were
carefully
descending
the
steep
bank
of
the
orchard
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
laugh
or
rather
outrageous
surely
not
like
that
leslie
replied
in
a
low
voice
feeling
really
hurt
i
do
though
i
will
race
you
to
the
bottom
no
no
dear
he
held
her
back
when
he
came
to
the
wicket
leading
on
to
the
front
lawns
he
said
something
to
her
softly
as
he
held
the
gate
i
think
he
wanted
to
utter
his
half
finished
proposal
and
so
bind
her
she
broke
free
and
observing
the
long
lawn
which
lay
in
grey
shadow
between
the
eastern
and
western
glows
she
cried
polka
can
dance
a
polka
when
the
grass
is
smooth
and
if
there
are
some
fallen
leaves
yes
jolly
she
held
out
her
hand
to
leslie
but
it
was
too
great
a
shock
to
his
mood
so
she
called
to
me
and
there
was
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
lest
after
all
she
should
be
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
sentiment
dance
with
hates
a
polka
i
danced
with
her
i
do
not
know
the
time
when
i
could
not
seems
innate
in
feet
to
dance
that
dance
we
went
flying
round
hissing
through
the
dead
leaves
the
night
the
low
hung
yellow
moon
the
pallor
of
the
west
the
blue
cloud
of
evening
overhead
went
round
and
through
the
fantastic
branches
of
the
old
laburnum
spinning
a
little
madness
you
can
not
tire
lettie
her
feet
are
wings
that
beat
the
air
when
at
last
i
stayed
her
she
laughed
as
fresh
as
ever
as
she
bound
her
hair
there
she
said
to
leslie
in
tones
of
extreme
satisfaction
that
was
lovely
do
you
come
and
dance
now
not
a
polka
said
he
sadly
feeling
the
poetry
in
his
heart
insulted
by
the
jigging
measure
but
one
can
not
dance
anything
else
on
wet
grass
and
through
shuffling
dead
leaves
you
george
emily
says
i
jump
he
replied
come
on
in
a
moment
they
were
bounding
across
the
grass
after
a
few
steps
she
fell
in
with
him
and
they
spun
round
the
grass
it
was
true
he
leaped
sprang
with
large
strides
carrying
her
with
him
it
was
a
tremendous
irresistible
dancing
emily
and
i
must
join
making
an
inner
ring
now
and
again
there
was
a
sense
of
something
white
flying
near
and
wild
rustle
of
draperies
and
a
swish
of
disturbed
leaves
as
they
whirled
past
us
long
after
we
were
tired
they
danced
on
at
the
end
he
looked
big
erect
nerved
with
triumph
and
she
was
exhilarated
like
a
bacchante
have
you
finished
leslie
asked
she
knew
she
was
safe
from
his
question
that
day
yes
she
panted
you
should
have
danced
give
me
my
hat
please
do
i
look
very
disgraceful
he
took
her
hat
and
gave
it
to
her
disgraceful
he
repeated
oh
you
solemn
what
is
it
yes
what
is
it
he
repeated
ironically
it
must
be
the
moon
now
is
my
hat
straight
tell
me
not
looking
then
put
it
level
now
then
why
your
hands
are
quite
cold
and
mine
so
hot
i
feel
so
impish
and
she
laughed
i
ready
do
you
notice
those
little
chrysanthemums
trying
to
smell
sadly
when
the
old
moon
is
laughing
and
winking
through
those
boughs
what
business
have
they
with
their
sadness
she
took
a
handful
of
petals
and
flung
them
into
the
air
they
sigh
they
ask
for
like
things
to
wink
and
look
wild
chapter
vi
the
education
of
george
as
i
have
said
strelley
mill
lies
at
the
north
end
of
the
long
nethermere
valley
on
the
northern
slopes
lay
its
pasture
and
arable
lands
the
shaggy
common
now
closed
and
part
of
the
estate
covered
the
western
slope
and
the
cultivated
land
was
bounded
on
the
east
by
the
sharp
dip
of
the
brook
course
a
thread
of
woodland
broadening
into
a
spinney
and
ending
at
the
upper
pond
beyond
this
on
the
east
rose
the
sharp
wild
grassy
hillside
scattered
with
old
trees
ruinous
with
the
gaunt
ragged
bones
of
old
grown
into
thorn
trees
along
the
rim
of
the
hills
beginning
in
the
northwest
were
dark
woodlands
which
swept
round
east
and
south
till
they
raced
down
in
riot
to
the
very
edge
of
southern
nethermere
surrounding
our
house
from
the
eastern
hill
crest
looking
straight
across
you
could
see
the
spire
of
selsby
church
and
a
few
roofs
and
the
of
the
pit
so
on
three
sides
the
farm
was
skirted
by
woods
the
dens
of
rabbits
and
the
common
held
another
warren
now
the
squire
of
the
estate
head
of
an
ancient
once
even
famous
but
now
decayed
house
loved
his
rabbits
unlike
the
family
fortunes
the
family
tree
flourished
amazingly
sherwood
could
show
nothing
comparable
its
ramifications
were
stupendous
it
was
more
like
a
banyan
than
a
british
oak
how
was
the
good
squire
to
nourish
himself
and
his
lady
his
name
his
tradition
and
his
thirteen
lusty
branches
on
his
meagre
estates
an
evil
fortune
discovered
to
him
that
he
could
sell
each
of
his
rabbits
those
bits
of
furry
vermin
for
a
shilling
or
thereabouts
in
nottingham
since
which
time
the
noble
family
subsisted
by
rabbits
farms
were
gnawed
away
corn
and
sweet
grass
departed
from
the
face
of
the
hills
cattle
grew
lean
unable
to
eat
the
defiled
herbage
then
the
farm
became
the
home
of
a
keeper
and
the
country
was
silent
with
no
sound
of
cattle
no
clink
of
horses
no
barking
of
lusty
dogs
but
the
squire
loved
his
rabbits
he
defended
them
against
the
snares
of
the
despairing
farmer
protected
them
with
gun
and
notices
to
quit
how
he
glowed
with
thankfulness
as
he
saw
the
dishevelled
hillside
heave
when
the
gnawing
hosts
moved
on
are
they
not
quails
and
manna
said
he
to
his
sporting
guest
early
one
monday
morning
as
the
high
meadow
broke
into
life
at
the
sound
of
his
gun
quails
and
this
wilderness
they
are
by
jove
assented
the
sporting
guest
as
he
took
another
gun
while
the
saturnine
keeper
smiled
grimly
meanwhile
strelley
mill
began
to
suffer
under
this
gangrene
it
was
the
outpost
in
the
wilderness
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
none
of
the
squire
tenants
had
a
gun
well
said
the
squire
to
saxton
you
have
the
land
for
next
to
to
a
rent
really
absurd
surely
the
little
that
the
rabbits
it
not
a
and
look
for
yourself
replied
the
farmer
the
squire
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
what
you
want
he
inquired
will
you
wire
me
off
was
the
repeated
request
wire
does
halkett
much
per
it
would
come
did
halkett
tell
me
now
a
large
sum
no
i
ca
do
it
well
i
ca
live
like
this
have
another
glass
of
whisky
yes
yes
i
want
another
glass
myself
and
i
ca
drink
if
i
am
to
enjoy
my
it
now
surely
you
exaggerate
a
little
it
not
so
bad
i
ca
go
on
like
it
i
sure
well
we
see
about
see
i
have
a
talk
with
halkett
and
i
come
down
and
have
a
look
at
you
we
all
find
a
pinch
nothing
but
humanity
heritage
i
was
born
in
september
and
love
it
best
of
all
the
months
there
is
no
heat
no
hurry
no
thirst
and
weariness
in
corn
harvest
as
there
is
in
the
hay
if
the
season
is
late
as
is
usual
with
us
then
sees
the
corn
still
standing
in
stook
the
mornings
come
slowly
the
earth
is
like
a
woman
married
and
fading
she
does
not
leap
up
with
a
laugh
for
the
first
fresh
kiss
of
dawn
but
slowly
quietly
unexpectantly
lies
watching
the
waking
of
each
new
day
the
blue
mist
like
memory
in
the
eyes
of
a
neglected
wife
never
goes
from
the
wooded
hill
and
only
at
noon
creeps
from
the
near
hedges
there
is
no
bird
to
put
a
song
in
the
throat
of
morning
only
the
crow
voice
speaks
during
the
day
perhaps
there
is
the
regular
breathing
hush
of
the
the
fretful
jar
of
the
mowing
machine
but
next
day
in
the
morning
all
is
still
again
the
lying
corn
is
wet
and
when
you
have
bound
it
and
lift
the
heavy
sheaf
to
make
the
stook
the
tresses
of
oats
wreathe
round
each
other
and
droop
mournfully
as
i
worked
with
my
friend
through
the
still
mornings
we
talked
endlessly
i
would
give
him
the
gist
of
what
i
knew
of
chemistry
and
botany
and
psychology
day
after
day
i
told
him
what
the
professors
had
told
me
of
life
of
sex
and
its
origins
of
schopenhauer
and
william
james
we
had
been
friends
for
years
and
he
was
accustomed
to
my
talk
but
this
autumn
fruited
the
first
crop
of
intimacy
between
us
i
talked
a
great
deal
of
poetry
to
him
and
of
rudimentary
metaphysics
he
was
very
good
stuff
he
had
hardly
a
single
dogma
save
that
of
pleasing
himself
religion
was
nothing
to
him
so
he
heard
all
i
had
to
say
with
an
open
mind
and
understood
the
drift
of
things
very
rapidly
and
quickly
made
these
ideas
part
of
himself
we
tramped
down
to
dinner
with
only
the
clinging
warmth
of
the
sunshine
for
a
coat
in
this
still
enfolding
weather
a
quiet
companionship
is
very
grateful
autumn
creeps
through
everything
the
little
damsons
in
the
pudding
taste
of
september
and
are
fragrant
with
memory
the
voices
of
those
at
table
are
softer
and
more
reminiscent
than
at
haytime
afternoon
is
all
warm
and
golden
oat
sheaves
are
lighter
they
whisper
to
each
other
as
they
freely
embrace
the
long
stout
stubble
tinkles
as
the
foot
brushes
over
it
the
scent
of
the
straw
is
sweet
when
the
poor
bleached
sheaves
are
lifted
out
of
the
hedge
a
spray
of
nodding
wild
raspberries
is
disclosed
with
belated
berries
ready
to
drop
among
the
damp
grass
lush
blackberries
may
be
discovered
then
one
notices
that
the
last
bell
hangs
from
the
ragged
spire
of
the
talk
is
of
people
an
odd
book
of
one
the
future
of
canada
where
work
is
strenuous
but
not
life
where
the
plains
are
wide
and
one
is
not
lapped
in
a
soft
valley
like
an
apple
that
falls
in
a
secluded
orchard
the
mist
steals
over
the
face
of
the
warm
afternoon
the
is
all
finished
and
it
only
remains
to
rear
up
the
fallen
bundles
into
shocks
the
sun
sinks
into
a
golden
glow
in
the
west
the
gold
turns
to
red
the
red
darkens
like
a
fire
burning
low
the
sun
disappears
behind
the
bank
of
milky
mist
purple
like
the
pale
bloom
on
blue
plums
and
we
put
on
our
coats
and
go
home
in
the
evening
when
the
milking
was
finished
and
all
the
things
fed
then
we
went
out
to
look
at
the
snares
we
wandered
on
across
the
stream
and
up
the
wild
hillside
our
feet
rattled
through
black
patches
of
scabius
we
skirted
a
swim
of
which
glistened
when
the
moon
touched
it
we
stumbled
on
through
wet
coarse
grass
over
soft
and
black
the
hills
and
woods
cast
shadows
the
pools
of
mist
in
the
valleys
gathered
the
moonbeams
in
cold
shivery
light
we
came
to
an
old
farm
that
stood
on
the
level
brow
of
the
hill
the
woods
swept
away
from
it
leaving
a
great
clearing
of
what
was
once
cultivated
land
the
handsome
chimneys
of
the
house
silhouetted
against
a
light
sky
drew
my
admiration
i
noticed
that
there
was
no
light
or
glow
in
any
window
though
the
house
had
only
the
width
of
one
room
and
though
the
night
was
only
at
eight
we
looked
at
the
long
impressive
front
several
of
the
windows
had
been
bricked
in
giving
a
pitiful
impression
of
blindness
the
places
where
the
plaster
had
fallen
off
the
walls
showed
blacker
in
the
shadow
we
pushed
open
the
gate
and
as
we
walked
down
the
path
weeds
and
dead
plants
brushed
our
ankles
we
looked
in
at
a
window
the
room
was
lighted
also
by
a
window
from
the
other
side
through
which
the
moonlight
streamed
on
to
the
flagged
floor
dirty
littered
with
paper
and
wisps
of
straw
the
hearth
lay
in
the
light
with
all
its
distress
of
grey
ashes
and
piled
cinders
of
burnt
paper
and
a
child
headless
doll
charred
and
pitiful
on
the
of
shadow
lay
a
round
fur
cap
i
blamed
the
moonlight
for
entering
the
desolate
room
the
darkness
alone
was
decent
and
reticent
i
hated
the
little
roses
on
the
illuminated
piece
of
wallpaper
i
hated
that
fireside
with
farmer
instinct
george
turned
to
the
outhouse
the
startled
me
it
was
a
forest
of
the
tallest
nettles
i
have
ever
far
taller
than
my
six
feet
the
air
was
soddened
with
the
dank
scent
of
nettles
as
i
followed
george
along
the
obscure
brick
path
i
felt
my
flesh
creep
but
the
buildings
when
we
entered
them
were
in
splendid
condition
they
had
been
restored
within
a
small
number
of
years
they
were
neat
and
cosy
here
and
there
we
saw
feathers
bits
of
animal
wreckage
even
the
remnants
of
a
cat
which
we
hastily
examined
by
the
light
of
a
match
as
we
entered
the
stable
there
was
an
ugly
noise
and
three
great
rats
half
rushed
at
us
and
threatened
us
with
their
vicious
teeth
i
shuddered
and
hurried
back
stumbling
over
a
bucket
rotten
with
rust
and
so
filled
with
weeds
that
i
thought
it
part
of
the
jungle
there
was
a
silence
made
horrible
by
the
faint
noises
that
rats
and
flying
bats
give
out
the
place
was
bare
of
any
vestige
of
corn
or
straw
or
hay
only
choked
with
a
growth
of
abnormal
weeds
when
i
found
myself
free
in
the
orchard
i
could
not
stop
shivering
there
were
no
apples
to
be
seen
overhead
between
us
and
the
clear
sky
either
the
birds
had
caused
them
to
fall
when
the
rabbits
had
devoured
them
or
someone
had
gathered
the
crop
this
said
george
bitterly
is
what
the
mill
will
come
to
after
your
time
i
said
my
time
i
shall
never
have
a
time
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
father
time
is
rabbits
and
one
thing
and
another
as
it
is
we
depend
on
the
and
on
the
carting
which
i
do
for
the
council
you
ca
call
it
farming
we
a
miserable
mixture
of
farmer
milkman
greengrocer
and
carting
contractor
it
a
shabby
business
you
have
to
live
i
retorted
it
rotten
and
father
wo
he
wo
change
his
methods
about
you
me
what
should
i
change
for
comfortable
at
home
as
for
my
future
it
can
look
after
itself
so
long
as
nobody
depends
on
me
laissez
faire
said
i
smiling
this
is
no
laissez
faire
he
replied
glancing
round
this
is
pulling
the
nipple
out
of
your
lips
and
letting
the
milk
run
away
sour
look
there
through
the
thin
veil
of
moonlit
mist
that
slid
over
the
hillside
we
could
see
an
army
of
rabbits
bunched
up
or
hopping
a
few
paces
forward
feeding
we
set
off
at
a
swinging
pace
down
the
hill
scattering
the
hosts
as
we
approached
the
fence
that
bounded
the
mill
fields
he
exclaimed
hullo
hurried
forward
i
followed
him
and
observed
the
dark
figure
of
a
man
rise
from
the
hedge
it
was
a
he
pretended
to
be
examining
his
gun
as
we
came
up
he
greeted
us
with
a
calm
george
replied
by
investigating
the
little
gap
in
the
hedge
i
trouble
you
for
that
snare
he
said
will
yer
answered
annable
a
broad
burly
fellow
should
like
ter
know
what
you
doin
on
th
wrong
side
th
you
can
see
what
we
over
my
the
rabbit
said
george
angrily
what
rabbit
said
annable
turning
sarcastically
to
me
you
know
well

can
hand
it
george
replied
or
what
spit
it
out
the
sound
wo
kill
me
man
grinned
with
contempt
hand
over
here
said
george
stepping
up
to
the
man
in
a
rage
now
do
said
the
keeper
standing
stock
still
and
looking
unmovedly
at
the
proximity
of
george
you
better
get
off
you
an
you
get
neither
snare
nor
we
see
said
george
and
he
made
a
sudden
move
to
get
hold
of
the
man
coat
instantly
he
went
staggering
back
with
a
heavy
blow
under
the
left
ear
damn
brute
i
ejaculated
bruising
my
knuckles
against
the
jaw
then
i
too
found
myself
sitting
dazedly
on
the
grass
watching
the
great
skirts
of
his
velveteens
flinging
round
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
demon
as
he
strode
away
i
got
up
pressing
my
chest
where
i
had
been
struck
george
was
lying
in
the
i
turned
him
over
and
rubbed
his
temples
and
shook
the
drenched
grass
on
his
face
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
dazed
then
he
drew
his
breath
quickly
and
put
his
hand
to
his
head
nearly
stunned
me
he
said
the
devil
i
answered
i
was
ready
no
did
he
knock
me
down
too
he
was
silent
for
some
time
sitting
limply
then
he
pressed
his
hand
against
the
back
of
his
head
saying
my
head
does
sing
he
tried
to
get
up
but
failed
good
god
knocked
into
this
state
by
a
damned
keeper
come
on
i
said
let
see
if
we
ca
get
indoors
no
he
said
quickly
we
need
tell
let
them
know
i
sat
thinking
of
the
pain
in
my
own
chest
and
wishing
i
could
remember
hearing
annable
jaw
smash
and
wishing
that
my
knuckles
were
more
bruised
than
they
that
was
bad
enough
i
got
up
and
helped
george
to
rise
he
swayed
almost
pulling
me
over
but
in
a
while
he
could
walk
unevenly
am
i
he
said
covered
with
clay
and
stuff
not
much
i
replied
troubled
by
the
shame
and
confusion
with
which
he
spoke
get
it
off
he
said
standing
still
to
be
cleaned
i
did
my
best
then
we
walked
about
the
fields
for
a
time
gloomy
silent
and
sore
suddenly
as
we
went
by
the
we
were
startled
by
great
swishing
black
shadows
that
swept
just
above
our
heads
the
swans
were
flying
up
for
shelter
now
that
a
cold
wind
had
begun
to
fret
nethermere
they
swung
down
on
to
the
glassy
shaking
the
moonlight
in
flecks
across
the
deep
shadows
the
night
rang
with
the
clacking
of
their
wings
on
the
water
the
stillness
and
calm
were
broken
the
moonlight
was
furrowed
and
scattered
and
broken
the
swans
as
they
sailed
into
shadow
were
dim
haunting
spectres
the
wind
found
us
shivering
wo
say
anything
he
asked
as
i
was
leaving
him
no
nothing
at
to
anybody
no
about
the
end
of
september
our
countryside
was
alarmed
by
the
harrying
of
sheep
by
strange
dogs
one
morning
the
squire
going
the
round
of
his
fields
as
was
his
custom
to
his
grief
and
horror
found
two
of
his
sheep
torn
and
dead
in
the
and
the
rest
huddled
in
a
corner
swaying
about
in
terror
smeared
with
blood
the
squire
did
not
recover
his
spirits
for
days
there
was
a
report
of
two
grey
wolvish
dogs
the
squire
keeper
had
heard
yelping
in
the
fields
of
collins
of
the
abbey
about
dawn
three
sheep
lay
soaked
in
blood
when
the
labourer
went
to
tend
the
flocks
then
the
farmers
took
alarm
lord
of
the
white
house
farm
intended
to
put
his
sheep
in
pen
with
his
dogs
in
charge
it
was
saturday
however
and
the
lads
ran
off
to
the
little
travelling
theatre
that
had
halted
at
westwold
while
they
sat
in
the
theatre
gloriously
nicknamed
the
watching
heroes
die
with
much
writhing
and
heaving
and
struggling
up
to
say
a
word
and
collapsing
without
having
said
it
six
of
their
silly
sheep
were
slaughtered
in
the
field
at
every
house
it
was
enquired
of
the
dog
nowhere
had
one
been
loose
saxton
had
some
thirty
sheep
on
the
common
george
determined
that
the
easiest
thing
was
for
him
to
sleep
out
with
them
he
built
a
shelter
of
hurdles
interlaced
with
brushwood
and
in
the
sunny
afternoon
we
collected
piles
of
bracken
browning
to
the
ruddy
now
he
slept
there
for
a
week
but
that
week
aged
his
mother
like
a
year
she
was
out
in
the
cold
morning
twilight
watching
with
her
apron
over
her
head
for
his
approach
she
did
not
rest
with
the
thought
of
him
out
on
the
common
therefore
on
saturday
night
he
brought
down
his
rugs
and
took
up
gyp
to
watch
in
his
stead
for
some
time
we
sat
looking
at
the
stars
over
the
dark
hills
now
and
then
a
sheep
coughed
or
a
rabbit
rustled
beneath
the
brambles
and
gyp
whined
the
mist
crept
over
the
and
the
webs
on
the
brambles
were
white
devil
throws
his
net
over
the
blackberries
as
soon
as
september
back
is
turned
they
say
i
saw
two
fellows
go
by
with
bags
and
nets
said
george
as
we
sat
looking
out
of
his
little
shelter
poachers
said
i
did
you
speak
to
them
did
see
me
i
was
dropping
asleep
when
a
rabbit
rushed
under
the
blanket
all
of
a
shiver
and
a
whippet
dog
after
it
i
gave
the
whippet
a
punch
in
the
neck
and
he
yelped
off
the
rabbit
stopped
with
me
quite
a
long
it
went
how
did
you
feel
i
did
care
i
do
care
much
what
happens
just
now
father
could
get
along
without
me
and
mother
has
the
children
i
think
i
shall
emigrate
why
did
you
before
oh
i
do
know
there
are
a
lot
of
little
comforts
and
interests
at
home
that
one
would
miss
besides
you
feel
somebody
in
your
own
countryside
and
you
nothing
in
a
foreign
part
i
expect
but
you
going
what
is
there
to
stop
here
for
the
valley
is
all
running
wild
and
unprofitable
you
no
freedom
for
thinking
of
what
the
other
folks
think
of
you
and
everything
round
you
keeps
the
same
and
so
you
change
everything
you
look
at
brings
up
the
same
old
feeling
and
stops
you
from
feeling
fresh
things
and
what
is
there
that
worth
anything
worth
having
in
my
life
i
thought
said
i
your
comfort
was
worth
having
he
sat
still
and
did
not
answer
what
shaken
you
out
of
your
nest
i
asked
i
do
know
i
not
felt
the
same
since
that
row
with
annable
and
lettie
said
to
me
you
ca
live
as
you
any
way
or
circumstance
you
like
a
bit
out
of
those
coloured
marble
mosaics
in
the
hall
you
have
to
fit
in
your
own
set
fit
into
your
own
pattern
because
you
put
there
from
the
first
but
you
do
want
to
be
like
a
fixed
bit
of
a
want
to
fuse
into
life
and
melt
and
mix
with
the
rest
of
folk
to
have
some
things
burned
out
of
she
was
downright
serious
well
you
need
not
believe
her
when
did
you
see
her
she
came
down
on
wednesday
when
i
was
getting
the
apples
in
the
morning
she
climbed
a
tree
with
me
and
there
was
a
wind
that
was
why
i
was
getting
all
the
apples
and
it
rocked
us
me
right
up
at
the
top
she
sitting
half
way
down
holding
the
basket
i
asked
her
did
she
think
that
free
kind
of
life
was
the
best
and
that
was
how
she
answered
me
you
should
have
contradicted
her
it
seemed
true
i
never
thought
of
it
being
wrong
in
fact
sounds
bad
thought
she
looked
down
on
our
way
of
life
i
thought
she
meant
i
was
like
a
toad
in
a
hole
you
should
have
shown
her
different
how
could
i
when
i
could
see
no
different
it
strikes
me
you
in
love
he
laughed
at
the
idea
saying
no
but
it
is
rotten
to
find
that
there
is
a
single
thing
you
have
to
be
proud
of
this
is
a
new
tune
for
you
he
pulled
the
grass
moodily
and
when
do
you
think
of
going
do
said
nothing
to
mother
not
yet
any
rate
not
till
spring
not
till
something
has
happened
said
i
what
he
asked
something
decisive
i
do
know
what
can
the
squire
turns
us
out
no
i
said
he
did
not
speak
you
should
make
things
happen
said
i
do
make
me
feel
a
worse
fool
cyril
he
replied
despairingly
gyp
whined
and
jumped
tugging
her
chain
to
follow
us
the
grey
blurs
among
the
blackness
of
the
bushes
were
resting
sheep
a
chill
dim
mist
crept
along
the
ground
but
for
all
that
cyril
he
said
to
have
her
laugh
at
you
across
the
table
to
hear
her
sing
as
she
moved
about
before
you
are
washed
at
night
when
the
fire
warm
and
you
tired
to
have
her
sit
by
you
on
the
hearth
seat
close
and
soft
in
spain
i
said
in
spain
he
took
no
notice
but
turned
suddenly
laughing
do
you
know
when
i
was
stooking
up
lifting
the
sheaves
it
felt
like
having
your
arm
round
a
girl
it
was
quite
a
sudden
sensation
you
better
take
care
said
i
you
mesh
yourself
in
the
silk
of
dreams
and
he
laughed
not
having
heard
my
words
the
time
seems
to
go
like
he
i
seem
to
sweep
the
mornings
up
in
a
handful
oh
lord
said
i
why
do
you
scheme
forgetting
what
you
want
instead
of
dreaming
fulfilments
well
he
replied
if
it
was
a
fine
dream
would
you
want
to
go
on
dreaming
and
with
that
he
finished
and
i
went
home
i
sat
at
my
window
looking
out
trying
to
get
things
straight
mist
rose
and
wreathed
round
nethermere
like
ghosts
meeting
and
embracing
sadly
i
thought
of
the
time
when
my
friend
should
not
follow
the
harrow
on
our
own
snug
valley
side
and
when
lettie
room
next
mine
should
be
closed
to
hide
its
emptiness
not
its
joy
my
heart
clung
passionately
to
the
hollow
which
held
us
all
how
could
i
bear
that
it
should
be
desolate
i
wondered
what
lettie
would
do
in
the
morning
i
was
up
early
when
daybreak
came
with
a
shiver
through
the
woods
i
went
out
while
the
moon
still
shone
sickly
in
the
west
the
world
shrank
from
the
morning
it
was
then
that
the
last
of
the
summer
things
died
the
wood
was
dark
smelt
damp
and
heavy
with
autumn
on
the
paths
the
leaves
lay
clogged
as
i
came
near
the
farm
i
heard
the
yelling
of
dogs
running
i
reached
the
common
and
saw
the
sheep
huddled
and
scattered
in
groups
something
leaped
round
them
george
burst
into
sight
pursuing
directly
there
was
the
bang
bang
of
a
gun
i
picked
up
a
heavy
piece
of
sandstone
and
ran
forwards
three
sheep
scattered
wildly
before
me
in
the
dim
light
i
saw
their
grey
shadows
move
among
the
gorse
bushes
then
a
dog
leaped
and
i
flung
my
stone
with
all
my
might
i
hit
there
came
a
howling
yelp
of
pain
i
saw
the
brute
make
off
and
went
after
him
dodging
the
prickly
bushes
leaping
the
trailing
brambles
the
gunshots
rang
out
again
and
i
heard
the
men
shouting
with
excitement
my
dog
was
out
of
sight
but
i
followed
still
slanting
down
the
hill
in
a
field
ahead
i
saw
someone
running
leaping
the
low
hedge
i
pursued
and
overtook
emily
who
was
hurrying
as
fast
as
she
could
through
the
wet
grass
there
was
another
gunshot
and
great
shouting
emily
glanced
round
saw
me
and
started
it
gone
to
the
quarries
she
panted
we
walked
on
without
saying
a
word
skirting
the
spinney
we
followed
the
brook
course
and
came
at
last
to
the
quarry
fence
the
old
excavations
were
filled
now
with
trees
the
steep
walls
twenty
feet
deep
in
places
were
packed
with
loose
stones
and
trailed
with
hanging
brambles
we
climbed
down
the
steep
bank
of
the
brook
and
entered
the
quarries
by
the
bed
of
the
stream
under
the
groves
of
ash
and
oak
a
pale
primrose
still
lingered
glimmering
wanly
beside
the
hidden
water
emily
found
a
smear
of
blood
on
a
beautiful
trail
of
yellow
convolvulus
we
followed
the
tracks
on
to
the
open
where
the
brook
flowed
on
the
hard
rock
bed
and
the
stony
floor
of
the
quarry
was
only
a
tangle
of
gorse
and
bramble
and
honeysuckle
take
a
good
stone
said
i
and
we
pressed
on
where
the
grove
in
the
great
excavation
darkened
again
and
the
brook
slid
secretly
under
the
arms
of
the
bushes
and
the
hair
of
the
long
grass
we
beat
the
cover
almost
to
the
road
i
thought
the
brute
had
escaped
and
i
pulled
a
bunch
of
berries
and
stood
tapping
them
against
my
knee
i
was
startled
by
a
snarl
and
a
little
scream
running
forward
i
came
upon
one
of
the
old
lime
kilns
that
stood
at
the
head
of
the
quarry
there
in
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
kilns
emily
was
kneeling
on
the
dog
her
hands
buried
in
the
hair
of
its
throat
pushing
back
its
head
the
little
jerks
of
the
brute
body
were
the
spasms
of
death
already
the
eyes
were
turning
inward
and
the
upper
lip
was
drawn
from
the
teeth
by
pain
good
lord
emily
but
he
is
dead
exclaimed
has
he
hurt
you
i
drew
her
away
she
shuddered
violently
and
seemed
to
feel
a
horror
of
herself
she
said
looking
at
herself
with
blood
all
on
her
skirt
where
she
had
knelt
on
the
wound
which
i
had
given
the
dog
and
pressed
the
broken
rib
into
the
chest
there
was
a
trickle
of
blood
on
her
arm
did
he
bite
you
i
asked
anxious
just
peeped
in
and
he
jumped
but
he
had
no
strength
and
i
hit
him
back
with
my
stone
and
i
lost
my
balance
and
fell
on
him
let
me
wash
your
arm
oh
she
exclaimed
is
it
horrible
oh
i
think
it
is
so
awful
what
said
i
busy
bathing
her
arm
in
the
cold
water
of
the
brook
whole
brutal
affair
it
ought
to
be
cauterised
said
i
looking
at
a
score
on
her
arm
from
the
dog
tooth
that
nothing
can
you
get
that
off
my
feel
hateful
to
myself
i
washed
her
skirt
with
my
handkerchief
as
well
as
i
could
saying
let
me
just
sear
it
for
you
we
can
go
to
the
kennels
do
feel
safe
otherwise
really
she
said
glancing
up
at
me
a
smile
coming
into
her
fine
dark
eyes
along
ha
ha
she
laughed
you
look
so
serious
i
took
her
arm
and
drew
her
away
she
linked
her
arm
in
mine
and
leaned
on
me
it
is
just
like
lorna
doone
she
said
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
but
you
will
let
me
do
it
said
i
referring
to
the
cauterising
you
make
me
but
i
shall
i
dare
think
of
it
get
me
some
of
those
berries
i
plucked
a
few
bunches
of
fruits
transparent
ruby
berries
she
stroked
them
softly
against
her
lips
and
cheek
caressing
them
then
she
murmured
to
herself
i
have
always
wanted
to
put
red
berries
in
my
hair
the
shawl
she
had
been
wearing
was
thrown
across
her
shoulders
and
her
head
was
bare
and
her
black
hair
soft
and
short
and
ecstatic
tumbled
wildly
into
loose
light
curls
she
thrust
the
stalks
of
the
berries
under
her
combs
her
hair
was
not
heavy
or
long
enough
to
have
held
them
then
with
the
ruby
bunches
glowing
through
the
black
mist
of
curls
she
looked
up
at
me
brightly
with
wide
eyes
i
looked
at
her
and
felt
the
smile
winning
into
her
eyes
then
i
turned
and
dragged
a
trail
of
convolvulus
from
the
hedge
and
i
twisted
it
into
a
coronet
for
her
there
said
i
you
crowned
she
put
back
her
head
and
the
low
laughter
shook
in
her
throat
what
she
asked
putting
all
the
courage
and
recklessness
she
had
into
the
question
and
in
her
soul
trembling
not
chloë
not
bacchante
you
have
always
got
your
soul
in
your
eyes
such
an
earnest
troublesome
soul
the
laughter
faded
at
once
and
her
great
seriousness
looked
out
again
at
me
pleading
you
are
like
damsels
troublesome
shadows
are
always
crowding
across
your
eyes
and
you
cherish
them
you
think
the
flesh
of
the
apple
is
nothing
nothing
you
only
care
for
the
eternal
pips
why
do
you
snatch
your
apple
and
eat
it
and
throw
the
core
away
she
looked
at
me
sadly
not
understanding
but
believing
that
i
in
my
wisdom
spoke
truth
as
she
always
believed
when
i
lost
her
in
a
maze
of
words
she
stooped
down
and
the
chaplet
fell
from
her
hair
and
only
one
bunch
of
berries
remained
the
ground
around
us
was
strewn
with
the
burrs
of
beechnuts
and
the
quaint
little
were
scattered
among
the
ruddy
fallen
leaves
emily
gathered
a
few
nuts
i
love
beechnuts
she
said
but
they
make
me
long
for
my
childhood
again
till
i
could
almost
cry
out
to
go
out
for
beechnuts
before
breakfast
to
thread
them
for
necklaces
before
supper
be
the
envy
of
the
others
at
school
next
day
there
was
as
much
pleasure
in
a
beech
necklace
then
as
there
is
in
the
whole
autumn
no
sadness
there
are
no
more
unmixed
joys
after
you
have
grown
up
she
kept
her
face
to
the
ground
as
she
spoke
and
she
continued
to
gather
the
fruits
do
you
find
any
with
nuts
in
i
asked
not
are
two
three
you
have
them
do
care
about
them
i
stripped
one
of
its
horny
brown
coat
and
gave
it
to
her
she
opened
her
mouth
slightly
to
take
it
looking
up
into
my
eyes
some
people
instead
of
bringing
with
them
clouds
of
glory
trail
clouds
of
sorrow
they
are
born
with
the
gift
of
sorrow
sorrows
they
proclaim
alone
are
real
the
veiled
grey
angels
of
sorrow
work
out
slowly
the
beautiful
shapes
sorrow
is
beauty
and
the
supreme
blessedness
you
read
it
in
their
eyes
and
in
the
tones
of
their
voices
emily
had
the
gift
of
sorrow
it
fascinated
me
but
it
drove
me
to
rebellion
we
followed
the
soft
turf
road
under
the
old
beeches
the
hillside
fell
away
dishevelled
with
thistles
and
coarse
grass
soon
we
were
in
sight
of
the
kennels
the
red
old
kennels
which
had
been
the
scene
of
so
much
animation
in
the
time
of
lord
byron
they
were
empty
now
overgrown
with
weeds
the
barred
windows
of
the
cottages
were
grey
with
dust
there
was
no
need
now
to
protect
the
windows
from
cattle
dog
or
man
one
of
the
three
houses
was
inhabited
clear
water
trickled
through
a
wooden
runnel
into
a
great
stone
trough
outside
near
the
door
come
here
said
i
to
emily
let
me
fasten
the
back
of
your
dress
is
it
undone
she
asked
looking
quickly
over
her
shoulder
and
blushing
as
i
was
engaged
in
my
task
a
girl
came
out
of
the
cottage
with
a
black
kettle
and
a
she
was
so
surprised
to
see
me
thus
occupied
that
she
forgot
her
own
duty
and
stood
ann
ann
called
a
voice
from
inside
are
ter
goin
ter
come
in
an
shut
that
door
sarah
ann
hastily
poured
a
few
cupfuls
of
water
into
the
kettle
then
she
put
down
both
utensils
and
stood
holding
her
bare
arms
to
warm
them
her
chief
garment
consisted
of
a
skirt
with
grey
bodice
and
red
flannel
skirt
very
much
torn
her
black
hair
hung
in
wild
tails
on
to
her
shoulders
we
must
go
in
here
said
i
approaching
the
girl
she
however
hastily
seized
the
kettle
and
ran
indoors
with
an
oh
mother
a
woman
came
to
the
door
one
breast
was
bare
and
hung
over
her
blouse
which
like
a
fell
loose
over
her
skirt
her
fading
hair
was
all
frowsy
from
the
bed
in
the
folds
of
her
skirt
clung
a
swarthy
urchin
with
a
shockingly
short
shirt
he
stared
at
us
with
big
black
eyes
the
only
portion
of
his
face
undecorated
with
egg
and
jam
the
woman
blue
eyes
questioned
us
languidly
i
told
her
our
errand
come
in
she
said
but
dunna
look
at
th
th
childers
not
been
long
up
go
in
billy
wi
nowt
on
we
entered
taking
the
forgotten
kettle
lid
the
kitchen
was
large
but
scantily
furnished
save
indeed
for
children
the
eldest
a
girl
of
twelve
or
so
was
standing
toasting
a
piece
of
bacon
with
one
hand
and
holding
back
her
nightdress
in
the
other
as
the
toast
hand
got
scorched
she
transferred
the
bacon
to
the
other
gave
the
hot
fingers
a
lick
to
cool
them
and
then
held
back
her
nightdress
again
her
auburn
hair
hung
in
heavy
coils
down
her
gown
a
boy
sat
on
the
steel
fender
catching
the
dropping
fat
on
a
piece
of
bread
one
two
three
four
five
six
drops
and
he
quickly
bit
off
the
tasty
corner
and
resumed
the
task
with
the
other
hand
when
we
entered
he
tried
to
draw
his
shirt
over
his
knees
which
caused
the
fat
to
fall
wasted
a
fat
baby
evidently
laid
down
from
the
breast
lay
kicking
on
the
squab
purple
in
the
face
while
another
lad
was
pushing
bread
and
butter
into
its
mouth
the
mother
swept
to
the
sofa
poked
out
the
bread
and
butter
pushed
her
finger
into
the
baby
throat
lifted
the
child
up
punched
its
back
and
was
highly
relieved
when
it
began
to
yell
then
she
administered
a
few
sound
spanks
to
the
naked
buttocks
of
the
crammer
he
began
to
howl
but
stopped
suddenly
on
seeing
us
laughing
on
the
which
served
as
hearth
rug
sat
a
beautiful
child
washing
the
face
of
a
wooden
doll
with
tea
and
wiping
it
on
her
nightgown
at
the
table
an
infant
in
a
high
chair
sat
sucking
a
piece
of
bacon
till
the
grease
ran
down
his
swarthy
arms
oozing
through
his
fingers
an
old
lad
stood
in
the
big
whose
back
was
hung
with
a
and
was
industriously
pouring
the
dregs
of
the
teacups
into
a
basin
of
milk
the
mother
whisked
away
the
milk
and
made
a
rush
for
the
urchin
the
baby
hanging
over
her
arm
the
while
i
could
half
kill
thee
she
said
but
he
had
slid
under
the
table
sat
serenely
unconcerned
could
you
asked
when
the
mother
had
put
her
bonny
baby
again
to
her
could
you
lend
me
a
knitting
needle
our
ann
wheer
thy
knittin
needles
asked
the
woman
wincing
at
the
same
time
and
putting
her
hand
to
the
mouth
of
the
sucking
child
catching
my
eye
she
said
you
would
credit
how
he
bites
nobbut
two
teeth
but
they
like
six
needles
she
drew
her
brows
together
and
pursed
her
lips
saying
to
the
child
naughty
lad
naughty
lad
tha
shanna
hae
it
no
not
if
ter
bites
thy
mother
like
that
the
family
interest
was
now
divided
between
us
and
the
private
concerns
in
process
when
we
entered
however
that
the
bacon
sucker
had
sucked
on
stolidly
immovable
all
the
time
our
sam
wheer
my
knittin
tha
it
cried
ann
after
a
little
search
na
replied
sam
from
under
the
table
yes

said
the
mother
giving
a
blind
prod
under
the
table
with
her
foot
na
then
persisted
sam
the
mother
suggested
various
possible
places
of
discovery
and
at
last
the
knitting
was
found
at
the
back
of
the
table
drawer
among
forks
and
old
wooden
skewers
i
ter
tell
yer
wheer
ivrythink
is
said
the
mother
in
mild
reproach
ann
however
gave
no
heed
to
her

the
mother
began
to
shake
with
quiet
laughter
his
father
learnt
him
it
all
up
she
whispered
proudly
to
to
him

conclusively
the
needle

in
the
fire
the
children
stood
about
watching
will
you
do
it
yourself
i
asked
emily
i
she
exclaimed
with
wide
eyes
of
astonishment
and
she
shook
her
head
emphatically
then
i
must
i
took
out
the
needle
holding
it
in
my
handkerchief
i
took
her
hand
and
examined
the
wound
but
when
she
saw
the
hot
glow
of
the
needle
she
snatched
away
her
hand
and
looked
into
my
eyes
laughing
in
a
fear
and
shame
i
was
very
serious
very
insistent
she
yielded
me
her
hand
again
biting
her
lips
in
imagination
of
the
pain
and
looking
at
me
while
my
eyes
were
looking
into
hers
she
had
courage
when
i
was
forced
to
pay
attention
to
my
cauterising
she
glanced
down
and
with
a
sharp
ah
ending
in
a
little
laugh
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
and
looked
again
up
at
me
with
wide
brown
eyes
all
quivering
with
apprehension
and
a
little
shame
and
a
laughter
that
held
much
pleading
one
of
the
children
began
to
cry
it
is
no
good
said
i
throwing
the
fast
cooling
needle
on
to
the
hearth
i
gave
the
girls
all
the
pennies
i
i
offered
sam
who
had
crept
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
table
a
sixpence
shonna
that
he
said
turning
from
the
small
coin
have
no
more
pennies
so
nothing
will
be
your
share
i
gave
the
other
boy
a
rickety
knife
i
had
in
my
pocket
sam
looked
fiercely
at
me
eager
for
revenge
he
picked
up
the
porkypine
quill
by
the
hot
end
he
dropped
it
with
a
shout
of
rage
and
seizing
a
cup
off
the
table
flung
it
at
the
fortunate
jack
it
smashed
against
the
the
mother
grabbed
at
sam
but
he
was
gone
a
girl
a
little
girl
wailed
oh
that
my
rosey
rosey
mug
we
fled
from
the
scene
of
confusion
emily
had
hardly
noticed
it
her
thoughts
were
of
herself
and
of
me
i
am
an
awful
coward
said
she
humbly
but
i
ca
help
she
looked
beseechingly
never
mind
said
i
all
my
flesh
seems
to
jump
from
it
you
do
know
how
i
feel
mind
i
could
help
it
not
for
my
life
i
wonder
said
i
if
anything
could
possibly
disturb
that
young
he
did
even
look
round
at
the
smash
no
said
she
biting
the
tip
of
her
finger
moodily
further
conversation
was
interrupted
by
howls
from
the
rear
looking
round
we
saw
sam
careering
after
us
over
the
turf
howling
scorn
and
derision
at
us
he
cried
his
bare
little
legs
twinkling
and
his
little
shirt
fluttering
in
the
cold
morning
air
fortunately
at
last
he
trod
on
a
thistle
or
a
thorn
for
when
we
looked
round
again
to
see
why
he
was
silent
he
was
capering
on
one
leg
holding
his
wounded
foot
in
his
hands
chapter
vii
lettie
pulls
down
the
small
gold
grapes
during
the
falling
of
the
leaves
lettie
was
very
wilful
she
uttered
many
banalities
concerning
men
and
love
and
marriage
she
taunted
leslie
and
thwarted
his
wishes
at
last
he
stayed
away
from
her
she
had
been
several
times
down
to
the
mill
but
because
she
fancied
they
were
very
familiar
receiving
her
on
to
their
rough
plane
like
one
of
themselves
she
stayed
away
since
the
death
of
our
father
she
had
been
restless
since
inheriting
her
little
fortune
she
had
become
proud
scornful
difficult
to
please
difficult
to
please
in
every
circumstance
she
who
had
always
been
so
rippling
in
thoughtless
life
sat
down
in
the
window
sill
to
think
and
her
strong
teeth
bit
at
her
handkerchief
till
it
was
torn
in
holes
she
would
say
nothing
to
me
she
read
all
things
that
dealt
with
modern
women
one
afternoon
lettie
walked
over
to
eberwich
leslie
had
not
been
to
see
us
for
a
fortnight
it
was
a
grey
dree
afternoon
the
wind
drifted
a
clammy
fog
across
the
hills
and
the
roads
were
black
and
deep
with
mud
the
trees
in
the
wood
slouched
sulkily
it
was
a
day
to
be
shut
out
and
ignored
if
possible
i
heaped
up
the
fire
and
went
to
draw
the
curtains
and
make
perfect
the
room
then
i
saw
lettie
coming
along
the
path
quickly
very
erect
when
she
came
in
her
colour
was
high
tea
not
laid
she
said
briefly
rebecca
has
just
brought
in
the
lamp
said
lettie
took
off
her
coat
and
furs
and
flung
them
on
the
couch
she
went
to
the
mirror
lifted
her
hair
all
curled
by
the
fog
and
stared
haughtily
at
herself
then
she
swung
round
looked
at
the
bare
table
and
rang
the
bell
it
was
so
rare
a
thing
for
us
to
ring
the
bell
from
the
that
rebecca
went
first
to
the
outer
door
then
she
came
in
the
room
saying
did
you
ring
i
thought
tea
would
have
been
ready
said
lettie
coldly
rebecca
looked
at
me
and
at
her
and
replied
it
is
but
four
i
can
bring
it
in
mother
came
down
hearing
the
clink
of
the
well
she
said
to
lettie
who
was
unlacing
her
boots
and
did
you
find
it
a
pleasant
walk
except
for
the
mud
was
the
reply
ah
i
guess
you
wished
you
had
stayed
at
home
what
a
state
for
your
boots
your
skirts
too
i
know
here
let
me
take
them
into
the
kitchen
let
rebecca
take
them
said
mother
was
out
of
the
room
when
mother
had
poured
out
the
tea
we
sat
silently
at
table
it
was
on
the
tip
of
our
tongues
to
ask
lettie
what
ailed
her
but
we
were
experienced
and
we
refrained
after
a
while
she
said
do
you
know
i
met
leslie
tempest
oh
said
mother
tentatively
did
he
come
along
with
you
he
did
not
look
at
me
oh
exclaimed
mother
and
it
was
speaking
volumes
then
after
a
moment
she
resumed
perhaps
he
did
not
see
you
or
was
it
a
stony
britisher
i
asked
he
saw
me
declared
lettie
or
he
would
have
made
such
a
babyish
show
of
being
delighted
with
margaret
raymond
it
may
have
been
no
still
may
not
have
seen
you
i
felt
at
once
that
he
had
i
could
see
his
animation
was
extravagant
he
need
not
have
troubled
himself
i
was
not
going
to
run
after
him
you
seem
very
cross
said
i
indeed
i
am
not
but
he
knew
i
had
to
walk
all
this
way
home
and
he
could
take
up
margaret
who
has
only
half
the
distance
was
he
driving
in
the
she
cut
her
toast
into
strips
viciously
we
waited
patiently
it
was
mean
of
him
was
it
mother
well
my
girl
you
have
treated
him
badly
what
a
baby
what
a
mean
manly
baby
men
are
great
infants
and
girls
said
mother
do
not
know
what
they
want
a
quality
i
added
nevertheless
said
lettie
he
is
a
mean
fop
and
i
detest
him
she
rose
and
sorted
out
some
stitchery
lettie
never
stitched
unless
she
were
in
a
bad
humour
mother
smiled
at
me
sighed
and
proceeded
to
gladstone
for
comfort
her
breviary
and
missal
were
morley
life
of
gladstone
i
had
to
take
a
letter
to
highclose
to
my
mother
concerning
a
bazaar
in
process
at
the
church
i
will
bring
leslie
back
with
me
said
i
to
myself
the
night
was
black
and
hateful
the
lamps
by
the
road
from
eberwich
ended
at
nethermere
their
yellow
blur
on
the
water
made
the
cold
wet
inferno
of
the
night
more
ugly
leslie
and
marie
were
both
in
the
a
library
half
a
business
office
used
also
as
a
lounge
room
being
cosy
leslie
lay
in
a
great
armchair
by
the
fire
immune
among
clouds
of
blue
smoke
marie
was
perched
on
the
steps
a
great
volume
on
her
knee
leslie
got
up
in
his
cloud
shook
hands
greeted
me
curtly
and
vanished
again
marie
smiled
me
a
quaint
vexed
smile
saying
oh
cyril
i
so
glad
you
come
i
so
worried
and
leslie
says
he

a
pastry
cook
though
i
sure
i
do
want
him
to
be
one
only
he
need
not
be
a
bear
what
the
matter
she
frowned
gave
the
big
volume
a
little
smack
and
said
why
i
do
so
much
want
to
make
some
of
those
spanish
tartlets

your
mother

so
delicious
and

i
looked
through

fifty
pages
more
and
leslie
wo

though
i

comical
despair

as
it
does
with
leslie
but

she
said
looking
at
me
softly
then
she
put
away
the
great
book
and
climbed
down
wo

leslie
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
women
he
said
rising
as
if
reluctantly
there
no
end
to
their
wants
and
their
caprices
i
thought
he
would
go
said
she
warmly
she
ran
to
fetch
his
overcoat
he
put
one
arm
slowly
in
the
sleeve
and
then
the
other
but
he
would
not
lift
the
coat
on
to
his
shoulders
well
she
said
struggling
on
tiptoe
you
are
a
great
creature
you
get
it
on
naughty
child
give
her
a
chair
to
stand
on
he
said
she
shook
the
collar
of
the
coat
sharply
but
he
stood
like
a
sheep
impassive
leslie
you
are
too
bad
i
ca
get
it
on
you
stupid
boy
i
took
the
coat
and
jerked
it
on
there
she
said
giving
him
his
cap
now
do

long
what
a
damned
dirty
night
said
he
when
we
were
out
it
is
said
i
the
town
anywhere
better
than
this
hell
of
a
country
ha
how
did
you
enjoy
yourself
he
began
a
long
history
of
three
days
in
the
metropolis
i
listened
and
heard
little
i
heard
more
plainly
the
cry
of
some
night
birds
over
nethermere
and
the
peevish
wailing
yarling
cry
of
some
beast
in
the
wood
i
was
thankful
to
slam
the
door
behind
me
to
stand
in
the
light
of
the
hall
leslie
exclaimed
mother
i
am
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
he
said
turning
to
lettie
who
sat
with
her
lap
full
of
work
her
head
busily
bent
you
see
i
ca
get
up
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
adorned
as
it
was
by
the
thimble
how
nice
of
you
to
come
we
did
not
know
you
were
back
but
he
exclaimed
then
he
stopped
i
suppose
you
enjoyed
yourself
she
went
on
calmly
immensely
thanks
snap
snap
snap
went
her
needle
through
the
new
stuff
then
without
looking
up
she
said
yes
no
doubt
you
have
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
enjoying
himself
how
do
you
mean
a
kind
of
shall
i
say
do
you
notice
it
mother
i
do
said
my
mother
i
suppose
it
means
we
may
not
ask
him
questions
lettie
concluded
always
very
busily
sewing
he
laughed
she
had
broken
her
cotton
and
was
trying
to
thread
the
needle
again
what
have
you
been
doing
this
miserable
weather
he
enquired
awkwardly
oh
we
have
sat
at
home
desolate
of
thee
i
so
on
have
we
mother
well
said
mother
i
do
know
we
imagined
him
all
sorts
of
lions
up
there
what
a
shame
we
may
not
ask
him
to
roar
his
old
roars
over
for
us
said
lettie
what
are
they
like
he
asked
how
should
i
know
like
a
sucking
dove
to
judge
from
your
present
voice
monstrous
little
voice
he
laughed
uncomfortably
she
went
on
sewing
suddenly
beginning
to
sing
to
herself
pussy
cat
pussy
cat
where
have
you
been
i
been
up
to
london
to
see
the
fine
queen
pussy
cat
pussy
cat
what
did
you
i
frightened
a
little
mouse
under
a
stair
i
suppose
she
added
that
may
be
so
poor
mouse
i
guess
none
the
worse
you
did
not
see
the
queen
though
she
was
not
in
london
he
replied
sarcastically
you
she
said
taking
two
pins
from
between
her
teeth
i
suppose
you
do
mean
by
that
she
was
in
queen
i
do
know
where
she
was
he
answered
angrily
oh
she
said
very
sweetly
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
met
her
in
eberwich
when
did
you
come
back
last
night
he
replied
did
you
come
and
see
us
before
i
been
at
the
offices
all
day
i
been
up
to
eberwich
she
said
innocently
have
you
yes
and
i
feel
so
cross
because
of
it
i
thought
i
might
see
you
i
felt
as
if
you
were
at
home
she
stitched
a
little
and
glanced
up
secretly
to
watch
his
face
redden
then
she
continued
innocently
felt
you
had
come
back
it
is
funny
how
one
has
a
feeling
occasionally
that
someone
is
near
when
it
is
someone
one
has
a
sympathy
with
she
continued
to
stitch
then
she
took
a
pin
from
her
bosom
and
fixed
her
work
all
without
the
least
suspicion
of
guile
i
thought
i
might
meet
you
when
i
was
another
pause
another
fixing
a
pin
to
be
taken
from
her
but
i
did
i
was
at
the
office
till
rather
late
he
said
quickly
she
stitched
away
calmly
provokingly
she
took
the
pin
from
her
mouth
again
fixed
down
a
fold
of
stuff
and
said
softly
you
little
liar
mother
had
gone
out
of
the
room
for
her
recipe
book
he
sat
on
his
chair
dumb
with
mortification
she
stitched
swiftly
and
unerringly
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
then
he
spoke
i
did
not
know
you
wanted
me
for
the
pleasure
of
plucking
this
crow
he
said
i
wanted
you
she
exclaimed
looking
up
for
the
first
time
who
said
i
wanted
you
no
one
if
you
did
want
me
i
may
as
well
go
the
sound
of
stitching
alone
broke
the
silence
for
some
moments
then
she
said
deliberately
what
made
you
think
i
wanted
you
i
do
care
a
damn
whether
you
wanted
me
or
whether
you
did
it
seems
to
upset
you
and
do
use
bad
language
it
is
the
privilege
of
those
near
and
dear
to
one
that
why
you
begin
it
i
suppose
i
can
not
she
said
loftily
he
laughed
sarcastically
you
so
beastly
cut
up
about
he
put
this
tentatively
expecting
the
soft
answer
but
she
refused
to
speak
and
went
on
stitching
he
fidgeted
about
twisted
his
cap
uncomfortably
and
sighed
at
last
he
said
we
done
then
she
had
the
vast
superiority
in
that
she
was
engaged
in
ostentatious
work
she
could
fix
the
cloth
regard
it
quizzically
rearrange
it
settle
down
and
begin
to
sew
before
she
replied
this
humbled
him
at
last
she
said
i
thought
so
this
afternoon
but
good
god
lettie
ca
you
drop
it
and
then
question
startled
him
why
it
he
replied
well
spoke
softly
gently
he
answered
to
the
call
like
an
eager
hound
he
crossed
quickly
to
her
side
as
she
sat
sewing
and
said
in
a
low
voice
you
do
care
something
for
me
do
you
lettie
well
was
modulated
kindly
a
sort
of
promise
of
assent
you
have
treated
me
rottenly
you
know
have
you
you
know
i
care
a
good
bit
it
is
a
queer
way
of
showing
it
her
voice
was
now
a
gentle
reproof
the
sweetest
of
surrenders
and
forgiveness
he
leaned
forward
took
her
face
in
his
hands
and
kissed
her
murmuring
you
are
a
little
tease
she
laid
her
sewing
in
her
lap
and
looked
up
the
next
day
sunday
broke
wet
and
dreary
breakfast
was
late
and
about
ten
we
stood
at
the
window
looking
upon
the
impossibility
of
our
going
to
church
there
was
a
driving
drizzle
of
rain
like
a
dirty
curtain
before
the
landscape
the
nasturtium
leaves
by
the
garden
walk
had
gone
rotten
in
a
frost
and
the
gay
green
discs
had
given
place
to
the
first
black
flags
of
winter
hung
on
flaccid
stalks
pinched
at
the
neck
the
grass
plot
was
strewn
with
fallen
leaves
wet
and
brilliant
scarlet
splashes
of
virginia
creeper
golden
drift
from
the
limes
ruddy
brown
shawls
under
the
beeches
and
away
back
in
the
corner
the
black
mat
of
maple
leaves
heavy
soddened
they
ought
to
have
been
a
vivid
lemon
colour
occasionally
one
of
these
great
black
leaves
would
loose
its
hold
and
zigzag
down
staggering
in
the
dance
of
death
there
now
said
lettie
suddenly
i
looked
up
in
time
to
see
a
crow
close
his
wings
and
clutch
the
topmost
bough
of
an
old
grey
holly
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
flapped
again
recovered
his
balance
and
folded
himself
up
in
black
resignation
to
the
detestable
weather
why
has
the
old
wretch
settled
just
over
our
noses
said
lettie
petulantly
just
to
blot
the
promise
of
a
sorrow
your
or
mine
i
asked
he
is
looking
at
me
i
declare
you
can
see
the
wicked
pupil
of
his
eye
at
this
distance
i
insinuated
well
she
replied
determined
to
take
this
omen
unto
herself
i
saw
him
first
for
sorrow
two
for
joy
three
for
a
letter
four
for
a
boy
five
for
silver
six
for
gold
and
seven
for
a
secret
never
told
may
bet
he
only
a
messenger
in
advance
there
be
three
more
shortly
and
you
have
your
four
said
i
comforting
do
you
know
she
said
it
is
very
funny
but
whenever
particularly
noticed
one
crow
i
had
some
sorrow
or
other
and
when
you
notice
four
i
asked
you
should
have
heard
old
wagstaffe
was
her
reply
she
declares
an
old
crow
croaked
in
their
apple
tree
every
day
for
a
week
before
jerry
got
drowned
great
sorrow
for
her
i
remarked
oh
but
she
wept
abundantly
i
felt
like
weeping
too
but
somehow
i
laughed
she
hoped
he
had
gone
to
sick
of
that
word
is
always
tangling
one
thoughts
but
jerry
i
insisted
oh
she
lifted
up
her
forehead
and
the
tears
dripped
off
her
nose
he
must
have
been
an
old
nuisance
syb
i
ca
understand
why
women
marry
such
men
i
felt
downright
glad
to
think
of
the
drunken
old
wretch
toppling
into
the
canal
out
of
the
way
she
pulled
the
thick
curtain
across
the
window
and
nestled
down
in
it
resting
her
cheek
against
the
edge
protecting
herself
from
the
cold
window
pane
the
wet
grey
wind
shook
the
half
naked
trees
whose
leaves
dripped
and
shone
sullenly
even
the
trunks
were
blackened
trickling
with
the
rain
which
drove
persistently
whirled
down
the
sky
like
black
maple
leaves
caught
up
aloft
came
two
more
crows
they
swept
down
and
clung
hold
of
the
trees
in
front
of
the
house
staying
near
the
old
forerunner
lettie
watched
them
half
amused
half
melancholy
one
bird
was
carried
past
he
swerved
round
and
began
to
battle
up
the
wind
rising
higher
and
rowing
laboriously
against
the
driving
wet
current
here
comes
your
fourth
said
i
she
did
not
answer
but
continued
to
watch
the
bird
wrestled
heroically
but
the
wind
pushed
him
aside
tilted
him
caught
under
his
broad
wings
and
bore
him
down
he
swept
in
level
flight
down
the
stream
outspread
and
still
as
if
fixed
in
despair
i
grieved
for
him
sadly
two
of
his
fellows
rose
and
were
carried
away
after
him
like
souls
hunting
for
a
body
to
inhabit
and
despairing
only
the
first
ghoul
was
left
on
the
withered
skeleton
of
the
holly
he
wo
even
say
i
remarked
he
has
more
sense
replied
lettie
she
looked
a
trifle
lugubrious
then
she
continued
better
say
than
why
i
asked
oh
i
do
know
fancy
this
she
had
been
sure
in
her
own
soul
that
leslie
would
she
began
to
doubt
were
very
perplexing
the
bell
in
the
kitchen
jangled
she
jumped
up
i
went
and
opened
the
door
he
came
in
she
gave
him
one
bright
look
of
satisfaction
he
saw
it
and
understood
helen
has
got
some
people
have
been
awfully
rude
to
leave
them
now
he
said
quietly
what
a
dreadful
day
said
mother
oh
fearful
your
face
red
lettie
what
have
you
been
doing
looking
into
the
fire
what
did
you
see
the
pictures
would
come
he
laughed
we
were
silent
for
some
time
you
were
expecting
me
he
murmured
knew
you
come
they
were
left
alone
he
came
up
to
her
and
put
his
arm
around
her
as
she
stood
with
her
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
you
do
want
me
he
pleaded
softly
yes
she
murmured
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
again
and
again
till
she
was
out
of
breath
and
put
up
her
hand
and
gently
pushed
her
face
away
you
are
a
cold
little
are
a
shy
bird
he
said
laughing
into
her
eyes
he
saw
her
tears
rise
swimming
on
her
lids
but
not
falling
why
my
love
my
put
his
face
to
her
and
took
the
tear
on
his
cheek
i
know
you
love
me
he
said
gently
all
tenderness
do
you
know
he
murmured
i
can
positively
feel
the
tears
rising
up
from
my
heart
and
throat
they
are
quite
painful
gathering
my
love
can
do
anything
with
me
they
were
silent
for
some
time
after
a
while
a
rather
long
while
she
came
upstairs
and
found
at
the
end
of
some
minutes
i
heard
my
mother
go
to
him
i
sat
by
my
window
and
watched
the
low
clouds
reel
and
stagger
past
it
seemed
as
if
everything
were
being
swept
myself
seemed
to
have
lost
my
substance
to
have
become
detached
from
concrete
things
and
the
firm
trodden
pavement
of
everyday
life
onward
always
onward
not
knowing
where
nor
why
the
wind
the
clouds
the
rain
and
the
birds
and
the
leaves
everything
whirling
all
this
time
the
old
crow
sat
motionless
though
the
clouds
tumbled
and
were
rent
and
piled
though
the
trees
bent
and
the
shivered
with
running
water
then
i
found
it
had
ceased
to
rain
that
there
was
a
sickly
yellow
gleam
of
sunlight
brightening
on
some
great
near
at
hand
till
they
looked
like
ripe
lemons
hanging
the
crow
looked
at
was
certain
he
looked
at
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
asked
him
he
eyed
me
with
contempt
great
featherless
half
winged
bird
as
i
was
incomprehensible
contemptible
but
awful
i
believe
he
hated
me
but
said
i
if
a
raven
could
answer
why
wo
you
he
looked
wearily
away
nevertheless
my
gaze
disquieted
him
he
turned
uneasily
he
rose
waved
his
wings
as
if
for
flight
poised
then
settled
defiantly
down
again
you
are
no
good
said
i
you
wo
help
even
with
a
word
he
sat
stolidly
unconcerned
then
i
heard
the
lapwings
in
the
meadow
crying
crying
they
seemed
to
seek
the
storm
yet
to
rail
at
it
they
wheeled
in
the
wind
yet
never
ceased
to
complain
of
it
they
enjoyed
the
struggle
and
lamented
it
in
wild
lament
through
which
came
a
sound
of
exultation
all
the
lapwings
cried
cried
the
same
tale
bitter
bitter
the
nothing
nothing
nothing
all
the
time
they
swung
about
on
their
broad
wings
revelling
there
said
i
to
the
crow
they
try
it
and
find
it
bitter
but
they
would
like
to
miss
it
to
sit
still
like
you
you
old
corpse
he
could
not
endure
this
he
rose
in
defiance
flapped
his
wings
and
launched
off
uttering
one
caw
of
sinister
foreboding
he
was
soon
whirled
away
i
discovered
that
i
was
very
cold
so
i
went
downstairs
twisting
a
curl
round
his
finger
one
of
those
loose
curls
that
always
dance
free
from
the
captured
hair
leslie
said
look
how
fond
your
hair
is
of
me
look
how
it
twines
round
my
finger
do
you
know
your
light
in
it
is
in
the
sun
it
is
like
wo
be
kept
in
bounds
she
replied
shame
if
it
this
it
brushes
my
sets
me
tingling
like
music
behave
now
be
still
and
i
tell
you
what
sort
of
music
you
make
me
like
the
calling
of
throstles
and
blackies
in
the
evening
frightening
the
pale
little
till
they
run
panting
and
swaying
right
up
to
our
wall
like
the
ringing
of
bluebells
when
the
bees
are
at
them
like
hippomenes
laughing
because
he
won
he
kissed
her
with
rapturous
admiration
marriage
music
sir
she
added
what
golden
apples
did
i
throw
he
asked
lightly
what
she
exclaimed
half
mocking
this
atalanta
he
replied
looking
lovingly
upon
her
this
believe
she
just
lagged
at
last
on
purpose
you
have
it
she
cried
laughing
submitting
to
his
caresses
it
was
apples
of
your
firm
apples
of
your
apples
eve
won
that
was
are
clever
you
are
rare
and
i
won
won
the
ripe
apples
of
your
cheeks
and
your
breasts
and
your
very
stop
your
roundness
and
warmness
and
won
you
lettie
she
nodded
wickedly
saying
all
admits
oh
let
me
breathe
did
you
claim
everything
yes
and
you
gave
it
me
not
yet
everything
though
every
atom

did
i
look
aside
with
the
inward
eye

now

were
two
oh

were
the
damosel

a
warm

kicking
the
brown
beech

below

driving
at

be
like
prayers

on
earth

thin
soul

your
souly
sort

ca
stand
not
a
an
albert
moore
i
think
there
more
in
the
warm
touch
of

soft
body

prayer

kisses

when

coloured
dust

light
or
when

with
a
butterfly

my
poor
me
what
becomes
of
the
when
the
moth

his
wings
against
a
butterfly
net

so
many
words
about

in
your
eyes
narcissus
narcissus

image

troubled
stream
distorting
your
fair
lineaments

laughing
at

behind
joke
thinking
you

like
sweet
beautiful
youth

be
dangerous

die
of
it
and
what

just
like
i
am
he
looked
proudly
thinking
she
referred
to
the
earnestness
of
her
love
in
the
wood
the
wind
rumbled
and
roared
hoarsely
overhead
but
not
a
breath
stirred
among
the
saddened
bracken
an
occasional
raindrop
was
shaken
out
of
the
trees
i
slipped
on
the
wet
paths
black
bars
striped
the
grey
where
water
had
trickled
down
the
bracken
was
overthrown
its
yellow
ranks
broken
i
slid
down
the
steep
path
to
the
gate
out
of
the
wood
armies
of
cloud
marched
in
rank
across
the
sky
heavily
laden
almost
brushing
the
gorse
on
the
common
the
wind
was
cold
and
disheartening
the
ground
sobbed
at
every
step
the
brook
was
full
swirling
along
hurrying
talking
to
itself
in
absorbed
intent
tones
the
clouds
darkened
i
felt
the
rain
careless
of
the
mud
i
ran
and
burst
into
the
farm
kitchen
the
children
were
painting
and
they
immediately
claimed
my
help
in
the
front
room
said
the
mother
quietly
for
it
was
sunday
afternoon
i
satisfied
the
little
ones
i
said
a
few
words
to
the
mother
and
sat
down
to
take
off
my
clogs
in
the
parlour
the
father
big
and
comfortable
was
sleeping
in
an
emily
was
writing
at
the
hurriedly
hid
her
papers
when
i
entered
george
was
sitting
by
the
fire
reading
he
looked
up
as
i
entered
and
i
loved
him
when
he
looked
up
at
me
and
as
he
lingered
on
his
quiet
hullo
his
eyes
were
beautifully
eloquent
as
a
kiss
we
talked
in
subdued
murmurs
because
the
father
was
asleep
opulently
asleep
his
tanned
face
as
still
as
a
brown
pear
against
the
wall
the
clock
itself
went
slowly
with
languid
throbs
we
gathered
round
the
fire
and
talked
quietly
about
merely
in
the
sound
of
our
voices
a
murmured
soothing
grateful
dispassionate
love
trio
at
last
george
rose
put
down
his
at
his
went
out
in
the
barn
there
was
a
sound
of
the
pulper
crunching
the
turnips
the
crisp
strips
of
turnip
sprinkled
quietly
down
onto
a
heap
of
gold
which
grew
beneath
the
pulper
the
smell
of
pulped
turnips
keen
and
sweet
brings
back
to
me
the
feeling
of
many
winter
nights
when
frozen
crunch
in
the
yard
and
orion
is
in
the
south
when
a
friendship
was
at
its
mystical
best
pulping
on
sunday
i
exclaimed
father
did
do
it
yesterday
it
his
work
and
i
did
notice
it
you
often
does
like
to
have
to
work
in
the
afternoon
now
the
cattle
stirred
in
their
stalls
the
chains
rattled
round
the
posts
a
cow
coughed
noisily
when
george
had
finished
pulping
and
it
was
quiet
enough
for
talk
just
as
he
was
spreading
the
first
layers
of
chop
and
turnip
and
ran
emily
with
her
hair
in
silken
twining
confusion
her
eyes
bid
us
go
in
to
tea
before
the
milking
was
begun
it
was
the
custom
to
milk
before
tea
on
george
abandoned
it
without
father
willed
it
so
and
his
father
was
master
not
to
be
questioned
on
farm
matters
however
one
disagreed
the
last
day
in
october
had
been
dreary
enough
the
night
could
not
come
too
early
we
had
tea
by
lamplight
merrily
with
the
father
radiating
comfort
as
the
lamp
shone
yellow
light
sunday
tea
was
imperfect
without
a
visitor
with
me
they
always
declared
it
was
perfect
i
loved
to
hear
them
say
so
i
smiled
rejoicing
quietly
into
my
teacup
when
the
father
said
it
seems
proper
to
have
cyril
here
at
sunday
tea
it
seems
natural
he
was
most
loath
to
break
the
delightful
bond
of
the
he
looked
up
with
a
glance
when
george
at
last
pushed
back
his
chair
and
said
he
supposed
he
better
make
a
start
ay
said
the
father
in
a
mild
conciliatory
tone
i
be
out
in
a
minute
the
lamp
hung
against
the
softly
illuminating
the
lower
part
of
the
building
where
bits
of
hay
and
white
dust
lay
in
the
hollows
between
the
bricks
where
the
curled
chips
of
turnip
scattered
orange
gleams
over
the
earthen
floor
the
lofty
roof
with
its
swallows
nests
under
the
tiles
was
deep
in
shadow
and
the
corners
were
full
of
darkness
hiding
half
hiding
the
hay
the
chopper
the
bins
the
light
shone
along
the
passages
before
the
stalls
glistening
on
the
moist
noses
of
the
cattle
and
on
the
whitewash
of
the
walls
george
was
very
cheerful
but
i
wanted
to
tell
him
my
message
when
he
had
finished
the
feeding
and
had
at
last
sat
down
to
milk
i
said
i
told
you
leslie
tempest
was
at
our
house
when
i
came
away
he
sat
with
the
bucket
between
his
knees
his
hands
at
the
cow
udder
about
to
begin
to
milk
he
looked
up
a
question
at
me
they
are
practically
engaged
now
i
said
he
did
not
turn
his
eyes
away
but
he
ceased
to
look
at
me
as
one
who
is
listening
for
a
noise
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
then
he
bent
his
head
and
leaned
it
against
the
side
of
the
cow
as
if
he
would
begin
to
milk
but
he
did
not
the
cow
looked
round
and
stirred
uneasily
he
began
to
draw
the
milk
and
then
to
milk
mechanically
i
watched
the
movement
of
his
hands
listening
to
the
rhythmic
clang
of
the
jets
of
milk
on
the
bucket
as
a
relief
after
a
while
the
movement
of
his
hands
became
slower
stopped
she
has
really
said
yes
i
nodded
and
what
does
your
mother
say
she
is
pleased
he
began
to
milk
again
the
cow
stirred
uneasily
shifting
her
legs
he
looked
at
her
angrily
and
went
on
milking
then
quite
upset
she
shifted
again
and
swung
her
tail
in
his
face
stand
still
he
shouted
striking
her
on
the
haunch
she
seemed
to
cower
like
a
beaten
woman
he
swore
at
her
and
continued
to
milk
she
did
not
yield
much
that
night
she
was
very
restive
he
took
the
stool
from
beneath
him
and
gave
her
a
good
blow
i
heard
the
stool
knock
on
her
prominent
hip
bone
after
that
she
stood
still
but
her
milk
soon
ceased
to
flow
when
he
stood
up
he
paused
before
he
went
to
the
next
beast
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
talk
but
just
then
the
father
came
along
with
his
bucket
he
looked
in
the
shed
and
laughing
in
his
mature
pleasant
way
said
so
you
an
onlooker
thought
you
have
milked
a
cow
or
two
for
me
by
now
nay
said
i
sunday
is
a
day
of
milking
makes
your
hands
ache
you
only
want
a
bit
more
practice
he
said
joking
in
his
ripe
fashion
why
george
is
that
all
you
got
from
julia
it
is
soon
going
dry
julia
old
lady
do
go
and
turn
skinny
when
he
had
gone
and
the
shed
was
still
the
air
seemed
colder
i
heard
his
stand
over
old
lass
from
the
other
shed
and
the
of
the
first
jets
of
milk
on
the
pail
he
has
a
comfortable
time
said
george
looking
savage
i
laughed
he
still
waited
you
really
expected
lettie
to
have
i
said
i
suppose
so
he
replied
then
she
made
up
her
mind
to
it
it
did
she
the
bottom
you
said
i
if
it
had
been
that
he
was
a
a
have
you
said
i
she
was
how
she
turned
and
kept
from
you
said
i
i
should
like
to
squeeze
her
till
she
screamed
you
should
have
gripped
her
before
and
kept
her
said
i
like
a
woman
like
a
to
strikes
a
bargain
women
are
all
tradesmen
do
generalise
it
no
good
she
like
a
it
banal
i
believe
she
loves
him
he
started
and
looked
at
me
queerly
he
looked
quite
childish
in
his
doubt
and
perplexity
she
loves
she
loved
me
better
he
muttered
and
turned
to
his
milking
i
left
him
and
went
to
talk
to
his
father
when
the
latter
four
beasts
were
finished
george
light
still
shone
in
the
other
shed
i
went
and
found
him
at
the
fifth
the
last
cow
when
at
length
he
had
finished
he
put
down
his
pail
and
going
over
to
poor
julia
stood
scratching
her
back
and
her
poll
and
her
nose
looking
into
her
big
startled
eye
and
murmuring
she
was
afraid
she
jerked
her
head
giving
him
a
good
blow
on
the
cheek
with
her
horn
you
ca
understand
them
he
said
sadly
rubbing
his
face
and
looking
at
me
with
his
dark
serious
eyes
i
never
knew
i
could
understand
them
i
never
thought
about
but
you
know
cyril
she
led
me
on
i
laughed
at
his
rueful
appearance
chapter
viii
the
riot
of
christmas
for
some
weeks
during
the
latter
part
of
november
and
the
beginning
of
december
i
was
kept
indoors
by
a
cold
at
last
came
a
frost
which
cleared
the
air
and
dried
the
mud
on
the
second
saturday
before
christmas
the
world
was
transformed
tall
silver
and
trees
rose
pale
against
a
sky
like
trees
in
some
rare
pale
paradise
the
whole
woodland
was
as
if
petrified
in
marble
and
silver
and
snow
the
and
long
leaves
of
the
rhododendron
were
rimmed
and
spangled
with
delicate
tracery
when
the
night
came
clear
and
bright
with
a
moon
among
the
i
rebelled
against
confinement
and
the
house
no
longer
the
mists
and
dank
weather
made
the
home
dear
tonight
even
the
glare
of
the
distant
little
iron
works
was
not
visible
for
the
low
clouds
were
gone
and
pale
stars
blinked
from
beyond
the
moon
lettie
was
staying
with
me
leslie
was
in
london
again
she
tried
to
remonstrate
in
a
sisterly
fashion
when
i
said
i
would
go
out
only
down
to
the
mill
said
i
then
she
hesitated
a
she
would
come
too
i
suppose
i
looked
at
her
curiously
for
she
said
you
would
rather
go
come
said
i
smiling
to
myself
lettie
was
in
her
old
animated
mood
she
ran
leaping
over
rough
places
laughing
talking
to
herself
in
french
we
came
to
the
mill
gyp
did
not
bark
i
opened
the
outer
door
and
we
crept
softly
into
the
great
dark
scullery
peeping
into
the
kitchen
through
the
crack
of
the
door
the
mother
sat
by
the
hearth
where
was
a
big
bath
half
full
of
soapy
water
and
at
her
feet
warming
his
bare
legs
at
the
fire
was
david
who
had
just
been
bathed
the
mother
was
gently
rubbing
his
fine
fair
hair
into
a
cloud
mollie
was
combing
out
her
brown
curls
sitting
by
her
father
who
in
the
was
reading
aloud
in
a
hearty
voice
with
quaint
precision
at
the
table
sat
emily
and
george
she
was
quickly
picking
over
a
pile
of
little
yellow
raisins
and
he
slowly
with
his
head
sunk
was
stoning
the
large
raisins
david
kept
reaching
forward
to
play
with
the
sleepy
his
mother
rubbing
there
was
no
sound
but
the
voice
of
the
father
full
of
zest
i
am
afraid
they
were
not
all
listening
carefully
i
clicked
the
latch
and
entered
lettie
exclaimed
george
cyril
cried
emily
cyril
shouted
david
hullo
cyril
said
mollie
six
large
brown
eyes
round
with
surprise
welcomed
me
they
overwhelmed
me
with
questions
and
made
much
of
us
at
length
they
were
settled
and
quiet
again
yes
i
am
a
stranger
said
lettie
who
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
furs
and
coat
but
you
do
not
expect
me
often
do
you
i
may
come
at
times
eh
we
are
only
too
glad
replied
the
mother
nothing
all
day
long
but
the
sound
of
the
mists
and
rotten
leaves
i
am
thankful
to
hear
a
fresh
voice
is
cyril
really
better
lettie
asked
emily
softly

a
spoiled
believe
he
keeps
a
little
bit
ill
so
that
we
can
cade
him
let
me
help
me

the
will
she
went
to
the
table
and
occupied
one
side
with
her
george
had
not
spoken
to
her
so
she
said
i
wo
help
because
i
do
like
to
feel
my
fingers
so
sticky
and
because
i
love
to
see
you
so
domesticated
you
enjoy
the
sight
a
long
time
then
for
these
things
are
numberless
you
should
eat
one
now
and
always
do
if
i
ate
one
i
should
eat
the
lot
then
you
may
give
me
your
one
he
passed
her
a
handful
without
speaking
that
is
too
many
your
mother
is
looking
let
me
just
finish
this
apple
there
i
not
broken
the
peel
she
stood
up
holding
up
a
long
curling
strip
of
peel
how
many
times
must
i
swing
it
mrs
saxton
three
it
not
all
hallows
eve
never
mind
look
she
carefully
swung
the
long
band
of
green
peel
over
her
head
three
times
letting
it
fall
the
third
the
cat
pounced
on
it
but
mollie
swept
him
off
again
what
is
it
cried
lettie
blushing
g
said
the
father
winking
and
mother
looked
daggers
at
him
it
is
nothink
said
david
naïvely
forgetting
his
confusion
at
being
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
in
his
shirt
mollie
remarked
in
her
cool
way
it
might
be
a
you
could
write
or
an
i
added
lettie
looked
over
at
me
imperiously
and
i
was
angry
what
do
you
say
emily
she
asked
nay
said
emily
it
only
you
can
see
the
right
letter
tell
us
what
the
right
letter
said
george
to
her
i
exclaimed
lettie
who
can
look
into
the
seeds
of
time
those
who
have
set
and
watched
sprout
said
i
she
flung
the
peel
into
the
fire
laughing
a
short
laugh
and
went
on
with
her
work
saxton
leaned
over
to
her
daughter
and
said
softly
so
that
he
should
not
hear
that
george
was
pulling
the
flesh
out
of
the
raisins
george
said
emily
sharply
you
leaving
nothing
but
the
husks
he
too
was
angry
he
would
fain
fill
his
belly
with
the
husks
that
the
swine
did
eat
he
said
quietly
taking
a
handful
of
the
fruit
he
had
picked
and
putting
some
in
his
mouth
emily
snatched
away
the
basin
it
is
too
bad
she
said
here
said
lettie
handing
him
an
apple
she
had
peeled
you
may
have
an
apple
greedy
boy
he
took
it
and
looked
at
it
then
a
malicious
smile
twinkled
round
his
eyes
he
said
if
you
give
me
the
apple
to
whom
will
you
give
the
peel
the
swine
she
said
as
if
she
only
understood
his
first
reference
to
the
prodigal
son
he
put
the
apple
on
the
table
do
you
want
it
she
said
mother
he
said
comically
as
if
jesting
she
is
offering
me
the
apple
like
eve
like
a
flash
she
snatched
the
apple
from
him
hid
it
in
her
skirts
a
moment
looking
at
him
with
dilated
eyes
and
then
she
flung
it
at
the
fire
she
missed
and
the
father
leaned
forward
and
picked
it
off
the
hob
saying
the
pigs
may
as
well
have
it
you
were
slow
a
lady
offers
you
a
thing
you
do
have
to
make
mouths
a
ce
parait
she
cried
laughing
now
at
her
ease
boisterously
is
she
making
love
emily
asked
the
father
laughing
suggestively
she
says
it
too
fast
for
me
said
emily
george
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
we
shall
have
to
finish
his
raisins
after
all
emily
said
lettie
brightly
look
what
a
lazy
animal
he
is
he
likes
his
comfort
said
emily
with
irony
the
picture
of
healthy
continued
lettie
as
he
sat
thus
with
his
head
thrown
back
against
the
end
of
the
coatless
his
red
neck
seen
in
repose
he
did
indeed
look
remarkably
comfortable
i
shall
never
fret
my
fat
away
he
said
stolidly
and
are
not
like
cyril
we
do
not
burn
our
bodies
in
our
our
hearts
do
we
we
have
it
in
common
said
he
looking
at
her
indifferently
beneath
his
lashes
as
his
head
was
tilted
back
lettie
went
on
with
the
paring
and
coring
of
her
she
took
the
raisins
meanwhile
emily
was
making
the
house
ring
as
she
chopped
the
suet
in
a
wooden
bowl
the
children
were
ready
for
bed
they
kissed
us
all
george
at
last
they
were
gone
accompanied
by
their
mother
emily
put
down
her
chopper
and
sighed
that
her
arm
was
aching
so
i
relieved
her
the
chopping
went
on
for
a
long
time
while
the
father
read
lettie
worked
and
george
sat
tilted
back
looking
on
when
at
length
the
mincemeat
was
finished
we
were
all
out
of
work
lettie
helped
to
clear
a
little
with
up
and
said
oh
i
too
excited
to
sit
so
near
us
play
at
something
a
dance
said
emily
a
dance
he
suddenly
sat
straight
and
got
up
come
on
he
said
he
kicked
off
his
slippers
regardless
of
the
holes
in
his
stocking
feet
and
put
away
the
chairs
he
held
out
his
arm
to
came
with
a
laugh
and
away
they
went
dancing
over
the
great
flagged
kitchen
at
an
incredible
speed
her
light
flying
steps
followed
his
leaps
you
could
hear
the
quick
light
tap
of
her
toes
more
plainly
than
the
thud
of
his
stockinged
feet
emily
and
i
joined
in
emily
movements
are
naturally
slow
but
we
danced
at
great
speed
i
was
hot
and
perspiring
and
she
was
panting
when
i
put
her
in
a
chair
but
they
whirled
on
in
the
dance
on
and
on
till
i
was
giddy
till
the
father
laughing
cried
that
they
should
stop
but
george
continued
the
dance
her
hair
was
shaken
loose
and
fell
in
a
great
coil
down
her
back
her
feet
began
to
drag
you
could
hear
a
light
slur
on
the
floor
she
was
could
see
her
lips
murmur
to
him
begging
him
to
stop
he
was
laughing
with
open
mouth
holding
her
tight
at
last
her
feet
trailed
he
lifted
her
clasping
her
tightly
and
danced
twice
round
the
room
with
her
thus
then
he
fell
with
a
crash
on
the
sofa
pulling
her
beside
him
his
eyes
glowed
like
coals
he
was
panting
in
sobs
and
his
hair
was
wet
and
glistening
she
lay
back
on
the
sofa
with
his
arm
still
around
her
not
moving
she
was
quite
overcome
her
hair
was
wild
about
her
face

was
anxious
the
father
said
with
a
shade
of
inquietude
you
overdone
is
very
foolish
when
at
last
she
recovered
her
breath
and
her
life
she
got
up
and
laughing
in
a
queer
way
began
to
put
up
her
hair
she
went
into
the
scullery
where
were
the
brush
and
combs
and
emily
followed
with
a
candle
when
she
returned
ordered
once
more
with
a
little
pallor
succeeding
the
flush
and
with
a
great
black
stain
of
sweat
on
her
leathern
belt
where
his
hand
had
held
her
he
looked
up
at
her
from
his
position
on
the
sofa
with
a
peculiar
glance
of
triumph
smiling
you
great
brute
she
said
but
her
voice
was
not
as
harsh
as
her
words
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
sat
up
and
laughed
quietly
another
he
said
will
you
dance
with
at
your
pleasure
come
minuet
do
know
it
nevertheless
you
must
dance
it
come
along
he
reared
up
and
walked
to
her
side
she
put
him
through
the
steps
even
dragging
him
round
the
waltz
it
was
very
ridiculous
when
it
was
finished
she
bowed
him
to
his
seat
and
wiping
her
hands
on
her
handkerchief
because
his
shirt
where
her
hand
had
rested
on
his
shoulders
was
moist
she
thanked
him
i
hope
you
enjoyed
it
he
said
ever
so
much
she
replied
you
made
me
look
a
no
doubt
you
did
do
you
think
you
could
look
a
fool
why
you
are
ironical
ca
marche
in
other
words
you
have
come
on
but
it
is
a
sweet
dance
he
looked
at
her
lowered
his
eyelids
and
said
nothing
ah
well
she
laughed
some
are
bred
for
the
minuet
and
some
tomfoolery
he
answered
call
it
tomfoolery
because
you
can
not
do
it
myself
i
like
and
i
ca
do
it
could
you
did
you
you
are
not
built
that
way
sort
of
clarence
macfadden
he
said
lighting
a
pipe
as
if
the
conversation
did
not
interest
him
ages
since
we
sang
that
macfadden
he
wanted
to
dance
but
his
feet
were
not
gaited
that
way
i
remember
we
sang
it
after
one
corn
had
a
fine
time
i
never
thought
of
you
before
as
clarence
it
is
very
funny
by
the
you
come
to
our
party
at
christmas
when
who
coming
the
the
old
from
highclose
and
what
will
you
do
sing
a
you
like
polka
and
valetas
come
and
dance
a
valeta
cyril
she
made
me
take
her
through
a
valeta
a
minuet
a
mazurka
and
she
danced
elegantly
but
with
a
little
of
carmen
dash
and
devilry
when
we
had
finished
the
father
said
very
pretty
indeed
they
do
look
nice
do
they
george
i
wish
i
was
young
as
i
said
george
laughing
bitterly
show
me
how
to
do
time
cyril
said
emily
in
her
pleading
way
which
displeased
lettie
so
much
why
do
you
ask
me
said
the
latter
quickly
you
are
not
often
here
i
am
here
now
and
she
waved
emily
imperiously
to
the
attempt
lettie
as
i
have
said
is
tall
approaching
six
feet
she
is
lissome
but
firmly
moulded
by
nature
graceful
in
her
poise
and
harmonious
movement
are
revealed
the
subtle
sympathies
of
her
artist
soul
the
other
is
shorter
much
heavier
in
her
every
motion
you
can
see
the
extravagance
of
her
emotional
nature
she
quivers
with
feeling
emotion
conquers
and
carries
havoc
through
her
for
she
has
not
a
strong
intellect
nor
a
heart
of
light
humour
her
nature
is
brooding
and
defenceless
she
knows
herself
powerless
in
the
tumult
of
her
feelings
and
adds
to
her
misfortunes
a
profound
mistrust
of
herself
as
they
danced
together
lettie
and
emily
they
showed
in
striking
contrast
my
sister
ease
and
beautiful
poetic
movement
was
exquisite
the
other
could
not
control
her
movements
but
repeated
the
same
error
again
and
again
she
gripped
lettie
hand
fiercely
and
glanced
up
with
eyes
full
of
humiliation
and
terror
of
her
continued
failure
and
passionate
trembling
hopeless
desire
to
succeed
to
show
her
to
explain
made
matters
worse
as
soon
as
she
trembled
on
the
brink
of
an
action
the
terror
of
not
being
able
to
perform
it
properly
blinded
her
and
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
that
she
must
do
a
turmoil
at
last
lettie
ceased
to
talk
and
merely
swung
her
through
the
dances
haphazard
this
way
succeeded
better
so
long
as
emily
need
not
think
about
her
actions
she
had
a
large
free
grace
and
the
swing
and
rhythm
and
time
were
imparted
through
her
senses
rather
than
through
her
intelligence
it
was
time
for
supper
the
mother
came
down
for
a
while
and
we
talked
quietly
at
random
lettie
did
not
utter
a
word
about
her
engagement
not
a
suggestion
she
made
it
seem
as
if
things
were
just
as
before
although
i
am
sure
she
had
discovered
that
i
had
told
george
she
intended
that
we
should
play
as
if
ignorant
of
her
bond
after
supper
when
we
were
ready
to
go
home
lettie
said
to
him
by
the
must
send
us
some
mistletoe
for
the
plenty
of
berries
you
know
are
there
many
berries
on
your
mistletoe
this
year
i
do
not
have
never
looked
we
will
go
and
you
like
george
answered
but
will
you
come
out
into
the
cold
he
pulled
on
his
boots
and
his
coat
and
twisted
a
scarf
round
his
neck
the
young
moon
had
gone
it
was
very
liquid
stars
wavered
the
great
night
filled
us
with
awe
lettie
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
held
it
tightly
he
passed
on
in
front
to
open
the
gates
we
went
down
into
the
front
garden
over
the
turf
bridge
where
the
sluice
rushed
coldly
under
on
to
the
broad
slope
of
the
bank
we
could
just
distinguish
the
gnarled
old
appletrees
leaning
about
us
we
bent
our
heads
to
avoid
the
boughs
and
followed
george
he
hesitated
a
moment
saying
let
me
think
they
are
two
trees
with
mistletoe
on
we
again
followed
silently
yes
he
said
here
they
are
we
went
close
and
peered
into
the
old
trees
we
could
just
see
the
dark
bush
of
the
mistletoe
between
the
boughs
of
the
tree
lettie
began
to
laugh
have
we
come
to
count
the
berries
she
said
i
ca
even
see
the
mistletoe
she
leaned
forwards
and
upwards
to
pierce
the
darkness
he
also
straining
to
look
felt
her
breath
on
his
cheek
and
turning
saw
the
pallor
of
her
face
close
to
his
and
felt
the
dark
glow
of
her
eyes
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
mouth
in
a
kiss
then
when
he
released
her
he
turned
away
saying
something
incoherent
about
going
to
fetch
the
lantern
to
look
she
remained
with
her
back
towards
me
and
pretended
to
be
feeling
among
the
mistletoe
for
the
berries
soon
i
saw
the
swing
of
the
hurricane
lamp
below
he
is
bringing
the
lantern
said
i
when
he
came
up
he
said
and
his
voice
was
strange
and
subdued
now
we
can
see
what
it
like
he
went
near
and
held
up
the
lamp
so
that
it
illuminated
both
their
faces
and
the
fantastic
boughs
of
the
trees
and
the
weird
bush
of
mistletoe
sparsely
pearled
with
berries
instead
of
looking
at
the
berries
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
his
lids
flickered
and
he
flushed
in
the
yellow
light
of
the
lamp
looking
warm
and
handsome
he
looked
upwards
in
confusion
and
said
there
are
plenty
of
berries
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
very
few
she
too
looked
up
and
murmured
her
assent
the
light
seemed
to
hold
them
as
in
a
globe
in
another
world
apart
from
the
night
in
which
i
stood
he
put
up
his
hand
and
broke
off
a
sprig
of
mistletoe
with
berries
and
offered
it
to
her
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
again
she
put
the
mistletoe
among
her
furs
looking
down
at
her
bosom
they
remained
still
in
the
centre
of
light
with
the
lamp
uplifted
the
red
and
black
scarf
wrapped
loosely
round
his
neck
gave
him
a
luxurious
generous
look
he
lowered
the
lamp
and
said
affecting
to
speak
naturally
is
plenty
this
year
you
will
give
me
some
she
replied
turning
away
and
finally
breaking
the
spell
when
shall
i
cut
it
strode
beside
her
swinging
the
lamp
as
we
went
down
the
bank
to
go
home
he
came
as
far
as
the
brooks
without
saying
another
word
then
he
bade
us
when
he
had
lighted
her
over
the
she
did
not
take
my
arm
as
we
walked
home
during
the
next
two
weeks
we
were
busy
preparing
for
christmas
ranging
the
woods
for
the
reddest
holly
and
pulling
the
gleaming
from
the
trees
from
the
farms
around
came
the
cruel
yelling
of
pigs
and
in
the
evening
later
was
a
scent
of
on
the
could
be
heard
the
sharp
trot
of
ponies
hastening
with
christmas
goods
there
the
carts
of
the
hucksters
dashed
by
to
the
expectant
villagers
triumphant
with
great
bunches
of
light
foreign
mistletoe
gay
with
oranges
peeping
through
the
boxes
and
scarlet
intrusion
of
apples
and
wild
confusion
of
cold
dead
poultry
the
hucksters
waved
their
whips
triumphantly
the
little
ponies
rattled
bravely
under
the
sycamores
towards
christmas
in
the
late
afternoon
of
the
when
dust
was
rising
under
the
hazel
brake
i
was
walking
with
lettie
all
among
the
mesh
of
twigs
overhead
was
tangled
a
dark
red
sky
the
boles
of
the
trees
grew
blue
tramping
down
the
riding
we
met
two
boys
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
old
their
clothes
were
largely
patched
with
tough
cotton
moleskin
scarves
were
knotted
round
their
throats
and
in
their
pockets
rolled
tin
bottles
full
of
tea
and
the
white
knobs
of
their
knotted
why
said
lettie
are
you
going
to
work
on
christmas

the
elder
and

dirty
little
uns
said
the
younger
lad
laughing
they
done
before
we
get
up
ter
th
top
added
the
elder
an
they
none
venture
down
th
shaft
if
they
did
put

the
other
you
ter
bath
after
a
bit
o

the
elder
sulkily
they
tramped
off
slurring
their
heavy
boots
merry

i
called
after
them
in
th
mornin
replied
the
elder
same
to
you
said
the
younger
and
he
began
to
sing
with
a
tinge
of
bravado
in
the
fields
with
their
flocks
abiding
they
lay
on
the
dewy
fancy
said
lettie
those
boys
are
working
for
me
we
were
all
going
to
the
party
at
highclose
i
happened
to
go
into
the
kitchen
about
half
past
seven
the
lamp
was
turned
low
and
rebecca
sat
in
the
shadows
on
the
table
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
i
saw
a
glass
vase
with
five
or
six
very
beautiful
christmas
roses
hullo
becka
who
sent
you
these
said
i
they
not
sent
replied
rebecca
from
the
depth
of
the
shadow
with
suspicion
of
tears
in
her
voice
why
i
never
saw
them
in
the
garden
perhaps
not
but
i
watched
them
these
three
weeks
and
kept
them
under
glass
for
christmas
they
are
beauties
i
thought
some
one
must
have
sent
them
to
you
it
little

rebecca
an
less
as
will

matter

was
nor
ever

well
something

you
becky
what
does
it
matter
if
it

what
are
my
feelings
a
bunch
flowers
as
a
gardener
clips
off
wi
never
a
thought

preferred
before
mine
as
i
fettled
after
this
i
can
sit
at
home
to
keep
my
flowers
wants
i
remembered
that
lettie
was
wearing
flowers
she
was
excited
and
full
of
the
idea
of
the
party
at
highclose
i
could
imagine
her
quick
oh

rebecca

said
i
she

excited
an
i
easy
forgotten
so
are
we
all
mieux
at
highclose
lettie
made
a
stir
among
the
little
belles
of
the
countryside
she
was
decidedly
the
most
distinguished
she
was
brilliant
moving
as
if
in
a
drama
leslie
was
enraptured
ostentatious
in
his
admiration
proud
of
being
so
well
infatuated
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
when
they
met
both
triumphant
excited
blazing
arch
looks
at
one
another
lettie
was
enjoying
her
public
demonstration
immensely
it
exhilarated
her
into
quite
a
vivid
love
for
him
he
was
magnificent
in
response
meanwhile
the
honoured
lady
of
the
house
pompous
and
ample
sat
aside
with
my
mother
conferring
her
patronage
on
the
latter
amiable
little
woman
who
smiled
sardonically
and
watched
lettie
it
was
a
splendid
party
it
was
brilliant
it
was
dazzling
i
danced
with
several
ladies
and
honourably
kissed
each
under
the
that
two
of
them
kissed
me
first
it
was
all
done
in
a
most
correct
manner
you

i
thought
the
same
replied
her
golaud
a
great
fat
fellow
with
a
childish
bare
face
he
smiled
awesomely
and
one
never
knew
what
he
meant
to
say
we
drove
home
in
the
early
christmas
morning
lettie
warmly
wrapped
in
her
cloak
had
had
a
little
stroll
with
her
lover
in
the
shrubbery
she
was
still
brilliant
flashing
in
her
movements
he
as
he
bade
her
was
almost
beautiful
in
his
grace
and
his
low
musical
tone
i
nearly
loved
him
myself
she
was
very
fond
towards
him
as
we
came
to
the
gate
where
the
private
road
branched
from
the
highway
we
heard
john
say
thank
you
looking
out
saw
our
two
boys
returning
from
the
pit
they
were
very
grotesque
in
the
dark
night
as
the
lamplight
fell
on
them
showing
them
grimy
flecked
with
bits
of
snow
they
shouted
merrily
their
good
wishes
lettie
leaned
out
and
waved
to
them
and
they
cried
christmas
came
in
with
their
acclamations
chapter
ix
lettie
comes
of
age
lettie
was
on
the
day
after
christmas
she
woke
me
in
the
morning
with
cries
of
dismay
there
was
a
great
fall
of
snow
multiplying
the
cold
morning
light
startling
the
twilight
the
lake
was
black
like
the
open
eyes
of
a
corpse
the
woods
were
black
like
the
beard
on
the
face
of
a
corpse
a
rabbit
bobbed
out
and
floundered
in
much
consternation
little
birds
settled
into
the
depth
and
rose
in
a
dusty
whirr
much
terrified
at
the
universal
treachery
of
the
earth
the
snow
was
eighteen
inches
deep
and
drifted
in
places
they
will
never
come
lamented
lettie
for
it
was
the
day
of
her
party
at
any
will
said
i
one
she
exclaimed
that
one
is
all
is
it
said
i
and
for
sure
george

for
the
fiftieth
time
if

thought
they
would
come
at
any
rate
the
extra
came
it
was
not
more
than
ten
when
leslie
arrived
ruddy
with
shining
eyes
laughing
like
a
boy
there
was
much
stamping
in
the
porch
and
knocking
of
leggings
with
his
stick
and
crying
of
lettie
from
the
kitchen
to
know
who
had
come
and
loud
cheery
answers
from
the
porch
bidding
her
come
and
see
she
came
and
greeted
him
with
effusion

my
little
woman

said

in
the
glass

asked
laughing
gay
looking
at
me
ah
but
look
at
yourself
there
i
declare

more
afraid
of
your
own
eyes
than

said
and
he
kissed
her
with
rapture
it

said

replied
so

i
you
promised
me
something
what
she
asked
if

it
gave
her
a
little
case
she
opened
it
and
instinctively
slipped
the
ring
on
her
finger
he
made
a
movement
of
pleasure
she
looked
up
laughing
breathlessly
at
him
now
said
he
in
tones
of
finality
ah
she
exclaimed
in
a
strange
thrilled
voice
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
after
a
while
when
they
could
talk
rationally
again
she
said

he
bit
his
moustache
angrily
and
said
at
last
then
i
suppose
i
better
send
john
round
for
the
lot
it
would
be
much
trouble
would
it
no
at
all
do
you
know
she
said
twisting
the
ring
on
her
finger
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
tied
something
round
my
finger
to
remember
by
it
somehow
remains
in
my
consciousness
all
the
time
at
any
rate
said
he
i
have
got
you
after
dinner
when
we
were
alone
lettie
sat
at
the
table
nervously
fingering
her
ring
it
is
pretty
mother

it
she
said
a
trifle
pathetically
yes
very
pretty
i
have
always
liked
leslie
replied
my
mother
but
it
feels
so
fidgets
me
i
should
like
to
take
it
off
you
are
like
me
i
never
could
wear
rings
i
hated
my
wedding
ring
for
months
did
you
mother
i
longed
to
take
it
off
and
put
it
away
but
after
a
while
i
got
used
to
it
i
glad
this
is
a
wedding
ring
leslie
says
it
is
as
good
said
i
ah
well
yes
but
still
it
is
she
put
the
jewels
round
under
her
finger
and
looked
at
the
plain
gold
she
twisted
it
back
quickly
saying
i
glad
it
yet
i
begin
to
feel
a
woman
little
feel
grown
up
my
mother
got
up
suddenly
and
went
and
kissed
lettie
fervently
let
me
kiss
my
girl
she
said
and
her
voice
was
muffled
with
tears
lettie
clung
to
my
mother
and
sobbed
a
few
quiet
sobs
hidden
in
her
bosom
then
she
lifted
her
face
which
was
wet
with
tears
and
kissed
my
mother
murmuring
no
about
three
the
carriage
came
with
leslie
and
marie
both
lettie
and
i
were
upstairs
and
i
heard
marie
come
tripping
up
to
my
sister
oh
lettie
he
is
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
you
never
knew
he
took
me
with
him
to
buy
me
see
it
on
i
think
it
awfully
lovely
here
let
me
help
you
to
do
your
in
those
little
will
look
charming
you
really
got
beautiful
so
much
life
in
a
pity
to
twist
it
into
a
coil
as
you
do
i
wish
my
hair
were
a
bit
really
it
all
the
better
for
this
you
like
it
think
these
little
puffs
are
just
is
rather
long
for
it
will
look
ravishing
really
my
eyes
and
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
are
my
best
features
do
you
think
marie
the
delightful
charming
little
creature
twittered
on
i
went
downstairs
leslie
started
when
i
entered
the
room
but
seeing
only
me
he
leaned
forward
again
resting
his
arms
on
his
knees
looking
in
the
fire
what
the
dickens
is
she
doing
he
asked
dressing
then
we
may
keep
on
waiting
is
it
a
deuced
nuisance
these
people
coming
well
we
generally
have
a
good
time
all
very
not
in
the
same
boat
you
and
me
fact
said
i
laughing
by
jove
cyril
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
i
never
could
ha
believed
i
should
be
like
it
all
the
time
when
it
is
at
the
top
of
your
blood
it
at
the
bottom
girl
the
girl
he
stared
into
the
fire
it
seems
pressing
you
pressing
you
on
never
leaves
you
alone
a
moment
again
he
lapsed
into
reflection
then
all
at
once
you
remember
how
she
kissed
you
and
all
your
blood
jumps
afire
he
mused
again
for
rather
he
seemed
fiercely
to
con
over
his
sensations
you
know
he
said
i
do
think
she
feels
for
me
as
i
do
for
her
would
you
want
her
to
said
i
i
do
know
perhaps
i
do
think
she
at
this
he
lighted
a
cigarette
to
soothe
his
excited
feelings
and
there
was
silence
for
some
time
then
the
girls
came
down
we
could
hear
their
light
chatter
lettie
entered
the
room
he
jumped
up
and
surveyed
her
she
was
dressed
in
soft
creamy
silken
stuff
her
neck
was
quite
bare
her
hair
was
as
marie
promised
fascinating
she
was
laughing
nervously
she
grew
warm
like
a
blossom
in
the
sunshine
in
the
glow
of
his
admiration
he
went
forward
and
kissed
her
you
are
splendid
he
said
she
only
laughed
for
answer
he
drew
her
away
to
the
great
and
made
her
sit
in
it
beside
him
she
was
indulgent
and
he
radiant
he
took
her
hand
and
looked
at
it
and
at
his
ring
which
she
wore
it
looks
all
right
he
murmured
anything
would
she
replied
what
do
they
and
i
do
know
nor
do
i
blue
for
hope
because
speranza
in
queen
had
a
blue
diamonds
crystalline
clearness
of
my
nature
its
glitter
and
hardness
you
are
a
hard
little
mistress
but
why
hope
why
reason
whatever
like
most
things
no
that
not
right
hope
a
silly
harp
with
no
strings
i
wonder
why
she
did
drop
her
harp
framework
over
the
edge
of
the
globe
and
take
the
handkerchief
off
her
eyes
and
have
a
look
round
but
of
course
she
was
a
a
man
woman
do
you
know
i
believe
most
women
can
sneak
a
look
down
their
noses
from
underneath
the
handkerchief
of
hope
tied
over
their
eyes
they
could
take
the
whole
muffler
they
do
do
it
the
dears
i
do
believe
you
know
what
you
talking
about
and
i
sure
i
do
sapphires
reminded
me
of
your
it
that
kept
the
faith
i
remember
something
about
it
here
said
she
pulling
off
the
ring
you
ought
to
wear
it
yourself
faithful
one
to
keep
me
in
constant
mind
keep
it
on
keep
it
on
it
holds
you
faster
than
that
fair
damsel
tied
to
a
tree
in
millais
believe
it
millais
she
sat
shaking
with
laughter
what
a
comparison
who
be
the
brave
knight
to
rescue
behind
ah
he
answered
it
does
matter
you
do
want
rescuing
do
you
not
yet
she
replied
teasing
him
they
continued
to
talk
half
nonsense
making
themselves
eloquent
by
quick
looks
and
gestures
and
communion
of
warm
closeness
the
ironical
tones
went
out
of
lettie
voice
and
they
made
love
marie
drew
me
away
into
the
dining
room
to
leave
them
alone
marie
is
a
charming
little
maid
whose
appearance
is
neatness
whose
face
is
confident
little
goodness
her
hair
is
dark
and
lies
low
upon
her
neck
in
wavy
coils
she
does
not
affect
the
fashion
in
coiffure
and
generally
is
a
little
behind
the
fashion
in
dress
indeed
she
is
a
bud
of
a
matron
conservative
full
of
proprieties
and
of
gentle
indulgence
she
now
smiled
at
me
with
a
warm
delight
in
the
romance
upon
which
she
had
just
shed
her
grace
but
her
demureness
allowed
nothing
to
be
said
she
glanced
round
the
room
and
out
of
the
window
and
observed
i
always

i
laughed
to
see
her
so
enthusiastic
in
her
admiration
of
my
sister
marie
is
such
a
gentle
serious
little
soul
she
went
to
the
window
i
kissed
her
and
pulled
two
berries
off
the
mistletoe
i
made
her
a
nest
in
the
heavy
curtains
and
she
sat
there
looking
out
on
the
snow
it
is
lovely
she
said
reflectively
people
must
be
ill
when
they
write
like
maxim

i
then

burly
fellow
moving
curiously
through
the
bushes

exclaimed
marie
he
did
when
he
came
near
enough
we
saw
he
was
straddled
upon
indian
marie
peeped
and
laughed
and
peeped
and
hid
again
in
the
curtains
laughing
he
was
very
red
and
looked
very
hot
as
he
hauled
the
great
meshes
shuffling
over
the
snow
his
body
rolled
most
comically
i
went
to
the
door
and
admitted
him
while
marie
stood
stroking
her
face
with
her
hands
to
smooth
away
the
traces
of
her
laughter
he
grasped
my
hand
in
a
very
large
and
heavy
glove
with
which
he
then
wiped
his
perspiring
brow
well
beardsall
old
man
he
said
and
how
things
god
i
not
hot
fine
idea
he
showed
me
his
ripping
ai
they
i
come
like
an
indian
he
rolled
his
r
and
lengthened
out
his
ah
could
resist
it
though
he
continued
remember
your
party
last
turned
up
on
the
eh
he
pursed
up
his
childish
lips
and
rubbed
his
fat
chin
having
removed
his
coat
and
the
white
wrap
which
protected
his
collar
not
to
mention
the
snowflakes
which
rebecca
took
almost
as
an
insult
to
seated
his
fat
hot
body
on
a
chair
and
proceeded
to
take
off
his
gaiters
and
his
boots
then
he
donned
his
dancing
pumps
and
i
led
him
upstairs
lord
i
skimmed
here
like
a
swallow
he
i
looked
at
his
corpulence
never
met
a
soul
though
they
had
a
down
the
road
i
saw
the
marks
of
a
cart
up
the
drive
so
i
guessed
the
tempests
were
here
so
lettie
put
her
nose
in
tempest
nobody
a
chance
women
have
rum
they
like
ravens
they
go
for
the
blame
it
leaves
nobody
a
chance
madie
howitt
coming
i
suppose
i
ventured
something
about
the
snow
she
come
he
said
if
it
up
to
the
neck
her
mother
saw
me
go
past
he
proceeded
with
his
toilet
i
told
him
that
leslie
had
sent
the
carriage
for
alice
and
madie
he
slapped
his
fat
legs
and
exclaimed
miss
smell
sulphur
beardsall
old
boy
there
fun
in
the
wind
madie
and
the
coy
little
tempest
he
hissed
a
line
of
a
song
through
his
teeth
during
all
this
he
had
straightened
his
cream
and
lavender
waistcoat
little
pink
of
a
girl
worked
it
for
real
juicy
little
somehow
or
other
had
arranged
his
white
had
drawn
forth
two
rings
one
a
great
signet
the
other
gorgeous
with
diamonds
and
had
adjusted
them
on
his
fat
white
fingers
he
had
run
his
fingers
delicately
through
his
hair
which
rippled
backwards
a
trifle
fine
and
somewhat
sapless
he
had
produced
a
box
containing
a
cream
carnation
with
suitable
greenery
he
had
flicked
himself
with
a
silk
handkerchief
and
had
dusted
his
shoes
lastly
he
had
pursed
up
his
lips
and
surveyed
himself
with
great
satisfaction
in
the
mirror
then
he
was
ready
to
be
presented
could
forget
lettie
would
have
let
old
pluto
and
all
the
bunch
of
keep
me
away
i
skimmed
here
like
a
on
my
like
hiawatha
coming
to
minnehaha
was
famine
said
marie
softly
and
this
is
a
feast

gorgeous
feast
miss
tempest
he
said
bowing
to
marie
who
laughed
you
have
brought
some
music
asked
mother
wish
i
was
orpheus
he
said
uttering
his
words
with
exaggerated
enunciation
a
trick
he
had
caught
from
his
singing
i
suppose
i
see
you
in
full
feather
tempest
is
she
kind
as
she
is
fair
who
will
pursed
up
his
smooth
sensuous
face
that
looked
as
if
it
had
never
needed
shaving
lettie
went
out
with
marie
hearing
the
bell
ring
she
an
houri
exclaimed
william

fool
said
i
oh

so
we
must
look
the
other
way
bel
homme
sans
merci
he
sighed
profoundly
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
keeping
one
eye
on
himself
in
the
mirror
as
he
did
so
then
he
adjusted
his
rings
and
went
to
the
piano
at
first
he
only
splashed
about
brilliantly
then
he
sorted
the
music
and
took
a
volume
of
tchaikowsky
songs
he
began
the
long
opening
of
one
song
was
unsatisfied
and
found
another
a
serenade
of
don
juan
then
at
last
he
began
to
sing
his
voice
is
a
beautiful
tenor
softer
more
mellow
less
strong
and
brassy
than
leslie
now
it
was
raised
that
it
might
be
heard
upstairs
as
the
melting
gush
poured
forth
the
door
opened
william
softened
his
tones
and
sang
but
he
did
not
glance
round
rapture
of
angels
exclaimed
alice
clasping
her
hands
and
gazing
up
at
the
lintel
of
the
door
like
a
sainted
virgin
murmured
madie
at
her
side
getting
tangled
in
her
mythology
alice
pressed
her
clasped
hands
against
her
bosom
in
ecstasy
as
the
notes
rose
higher
hold
me
madie
or
i
shall
rush
to
extinction
in
the
arms
of
this
siren
she
clung
to
madie
the
song
finished
and
will
turned
round
take
it
calmly
miss
gall
he
said
i
hope
you
not
hit
too
badly
can
you
say
it
can
the
savage
beast
be
calm
i
sorry
for
you

alice
out
in
the
cold
and
driving
fear
said
he
and
he
turned
to
talk
to
madie
alice
sat
chatting
with
mother
soon
tom
smith
came
and
took
a
seat
next
to
marie
and
sat
quietly
looking
over
his
spectacles
with
his
sharp
brown
eyes
full
of
scorn
for
william
full
of
misgiving
for
leslie
and
lettie
shortly
after
george
and
emily
came
in
they
were
rather
nervous
when
they
had
changed
their
clogs
and
emily
had
taken
off
her
leggings
and
he
his
leather
ones
they
were
not
anxious
to
go
into
the
drawing
room
i
was
so
was
see
that
he
had
put
on
dancing
shoes
emily
ruddy
from
the
cold
air
was
wearing
a
wine
coloured
dress
which
suited
her
luxurious
beauty
george
clothes
were
well
was
a
point
on
which
he
was
particular
being
somewhat
he
wore
a
jacket
and
a
dark
bow
the
other
men
were
in
evening
dress
we
took
them
into
the
where
the
lamp
was
not
lighted
and
the
glow
of
the
fire
was
becoming
evident
in
the
dusk
we
had
taken
up
the
floor
was
all
some
of
the
furniture
was
taken
that
the
room
looked
large
and
ample
there
was
general
hand
shaking
and
the
newcomers
were
seated
near
the
fire
first
mother
talked
to
the
candles
were
lighted
at
the
piano
and
will
played
to
us
he
is
an
exquisite
pianist
full
of
refinement
and
poetry
it
is
astonishing
and
it
is
a
fact
mother
went
out
to
attend
to
the
tea
and
after
a
while
lettie
crossed
over
to
emily
and
george
and
drawing
up
a
low
chair
sat
down
to
talk
to
them
leslie
stood
in
the
window
bay
looking
out
on
the
lawn
where
the
snow
grew
bluer
and
bluer
and
the
sky
almost
purple
lettie
put
her
hands
on
emily
lap
and
said
softly
you
like
it
what
engaged
exclaimed
emily
i
am
of
age
you
see
said
lettie
it
is
a
beauty
is
it
let
me
try
it
on
will
you
yes
i
never
had
a
ring
there
it
wo
go
over
my
thought
not
are
my
hands
red
the
it
too
small
for
me
i
do
like
it
george
sat
watching
the
play
of
the
four
hands
in
his
sister
lap
two
hands
moving
so
white
and
fascinating
in
the
twilight
the
other
two
rather
red
with
rather
large
bones
looking
so
nervous
almost
hysterical
the
ring
played
between
the
four
hands
giving
an
occasional
flash
from
the
twilight
or
candlelight
you
must
congratulate
me
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
and
two
of
us
knew
she
spoke
to
him
as
yes
said
emily
i
do
and
you
she
said
turning
to
him
who
was
silent
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
he
asked
say
what
you
like
sometime
when
i
thought
about
it
cold
dinners
laughed
lettie
awaking
alice
old
sarcasm
at
his
slowness
what
he
exclaimed
looking
up
suddenly
at
her
taunt
she
knew
she
was
playing
false
she
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
went
across
the
room
to
leslie
laying
her
arm
over
his
shoulder
and
leaning
her
head
against
him
murmuring
softly
to
him
he
poor
fellow
was
delighted
with
her
for
she
did
not
display
her
fondness
often
we
went
in
to
tea
the
yellow
shaded
lamp
shone
softly
over
the
table
where
christmas
roses
spread
wide
open
among
some
leaves
where
the
china
and
silver
and
the
coloured
dishes
shone
delightfully
we
were
all
very
gay
and
bright
who
could
be
otherwise
seated
round
a
table
with
young
company
and
the
snow
outside
george
felt
awkward
when
he
noticed
his
hands
over
the
table
but
for
the
rest
we
enjoyed
ourselves
exceedingly
the
conversation
veered
inevitably
to
marriage
but
what
have
you
to
say
about
it
mr
smith
asked
little
marie
nothing
yet
replied
he
in
his
peculiar
grating
voice
my
marriage
is
in
the
unanalysed
solution
of
the
i
done
the
analysis
i
tell
you
but
what
do
you
think
about
do
you
remember
lettie
said
will
bancroft
that
little
girl
who
was
in
our
year
at
college
she
has
just
married
old
craven
out
of
physic
department
i
wish
her
joy
of
it
said
lettie
was
she
an
old
flame
of
yours
among
the
rest
he
replied
smiling
do
you
remember
you
were
one
of
them
you
had
your
day
what
a
joke
that
was
exclaimed
lettie
we
used
to
go
in
the
arboretum
at
you
lasted
half
one
autumn
do
you
remember
when
we
gave
a
concert
you
and
i
and
frank
wishaw
in
the
small
lecture
theatre
when
the
prinny
was
such
an
old
buck
flattering
you
continued
will
and
that
night
wishaw
took
you
to
the
old
gettim
for
a
cab
and
saw
you
in
large
as
was
such
a
thing
before
old
wishaw
won
you
with
that
cab
did
he
oh
how
i
swelled
cried
lettie
there
were
you
all
at
the
top
of
the
steps
gazing
with
admiration
but
frank
wishaw
was
not
a
nice
fellow
though
he
played
the
violin
beautifully
i
never
liked
his
no
added
will
he
did
last
long
did
he
long
enough
to
oust
me
we
had
a
giddy
ripping
time
in
did
we
it
was
not
bad
said
lettie
rather
foolish
i
afraid
i
wasted
my
three
years
i
think
said
leslie
smiling
you
improved
the
shining
hours
to
great
purpose
it
pleased
him
to
think
what
a
flirt
she
had
been
since
the
flirting
had
been
harmless
and
only
added
to
the
glory
of
his
final
conquest
george
felt
very
much
left
out
during
these
reminiscences
when
we
had
finished
tea
we
adjourned
to
the
it
was
in
darkness
save
for
the
fire
light
the
mistletoe
had
been
discovered
and
was
being
appreciated
georgie
sybil
sybil
georgie
come
and
kiss
me
cried
alice
will
went
forward
to
do
her
the
honour
she
ran
to
me
saying
get
away
you
fat
on
your
own
preserves
now
georgie
dear
come
and
kiss
me
you
have
got
nobody
else
but
me
no
y
ave
do
you
want
to
run
away
like
sha
cry
sure
i
sha
if
you
are
ugly
she
took
him
and
kissed
him
on
either
cheek
saying
softly
you
be
so
serious
old
up
there
a
good
fellow
we
lighted
the
lamp
and
charades
were
proposed
leslie
and
lettie
will
and
madie
and
alice
went
out
to
play
the
first
scene
was
an
elopement
to
gretna
alice
a
maid
servant
a
part
that
she
played
wonderfully
well
as
a
caricature
it
was
very
noisy
and
extremely
funny
leslie
was
in
high
spirits
it
was
remarkable
to
observe
that
as
he
became
more
animated
more
abundantly
energetic
lettie
became
quieter
the
second
scene
which
they
were
playing
as
excited
melodrama
she
turned
into
small
tragedy
with
her
bitterness
they
went
out
and
lettie
blew
us
kisses
from
the
doorway
does
she
act
well
exclaimed
marie
speaking
to
tom
quite
realistic
said
he
she
could
always
play
a
part
well
said
mother
i
should
think
said
emily
she
could
take
a
role
in
life
and
play
up
to
it
i
believe
she
could
mother
answered
there
would
only
be
intervals
when
she
would
see
herself
in
a
mirror
acting
and
what
then
said
marie
she
would
feel
desperate
and
wait
till
the
fit
passed
off
replied
my
mother
smiling
significantly
the
players
came
in
again
lettie
kept
her
part
subordinate
leslie
played
with
brilliance
it
was
rather
startling
how
he
excelled
the
applause
was
we
could
not
guess
the
word
then
they
laughed
and
told
us
we
clamoured
for
more
do
go
dear
said
lettie
to
leslie
and
i
will
be
helping
to
arrange
the
room
for
the
dances
i
want
to
watch
am
rather
is
so
will
take
my
place
they
went
marie
and
tom
and
mother
and
i
played
bridge
in
one
corner
lettie
said
she
wanted
to
show
george
some
new
pictures
and
they
bent
over
a
portfolio
for
some
time
then
she
bade
him
help
her
to
clear
the
room
for
the
dances
well
you
have
had
time
to
think
she
said
to
him
a
short
time
he
replied
what
shall
i
say
tell
me
what
you
been
thinking
he
answered
smiling
foolishly
what
about
me
she
asked
venturesome
about
you
how
you
were
at
college
he
replied
oh
i
had
a
good
time
i
had
plenty
of
boys
i
liked
them
all
till
i
found
there
was
nothing
in
them
then
they
tired
me
poor
boys
he
said
laughing
were
they
all
alike
all
alike
she
replied
and
they
are
still
pity
he
said
smiling
it
hard
lines
on
you
why
she
asked
it
leaves
you
nobody
to
care
he
replied
how
very
sarcastic
you
are
you
make
one
reservation
do
i
he
answered
smiling
but
you
fire
sharp
into
the
air
and
then
say
we
all
blank
one
of
course
you
she
queried
oh
you
would
forever
hang
fire
dinners
he
quoted
in
bitterness
but
you
knew
i
loved
you
you
knew
well
enough
past
tense
she
replied
it
perfect
next
time
it
you
who
hang
you
who
make
me
he
said
and
so
from
the
retort
circumstantial
to
the
retort
direct
she
replied
smiling
you
put
me
off
he
insisted
growing
excited
for
reply
she
held
out
her
hand
and
showed
him
the
ring
she
smiled
very
quietly
he
stared
at
her
with
darkening
anger
will
you
gather
the
rugs
and
stools
together
and
put
them
in
that
corner
she
said
he
turned
away
to
do
so
but
he
looked
back
again
and
said
in
low
passionate
tones
you
never
counted
me
i
was
a
figure
naught
in
the
counting
all
along
is
a
chair
that
will
be
in
the
way
she
replied
calmly
but
she
flushed
and
bowed
her
head
she
turned
away
and
he
dragged
an
armful
of
rugs
into
a
corner
when
the
actors
came
in
lettie
was
moving
a
vase
of
flowers
while
they
played
she
sat
looking
on
smiling
clapping
her
hands
when
it
was
finished
leslie
came
and
whispered
to
her
whereon
she
kissed
him
unobserved
delighting
and
exhilarating
him
more
than
ever
then
they
went
out
to
prepare
the
next
act
george
did
not
return
to
her
till
she
called
him
to
help
her
her
colour
was
high
in
her
cheeks
how
do
you
know
you
did
not
count
she
said
nervously
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
play
this
forbidden
game
he
laughed
and
for
a
moment
could
not
find
any
reply
i
do
he
said
you
knew
you
could
have
me
any
day
so
you
care
then
we
behaving
in
quite
the
traditional
fashion
she
answered
with
irony
but
you
know
he
said
you
began
it
you
played
with
me
and
showed
me
heaps
of
those
i
was
binding
corn
and
when
i
was
gathering
the
apples
and
when
i
was
finishing
the
came
can
never
forget
those
will
never
be
the
have
awakened
my
imagine
things
that
i
could
have
done
ah
am
very
sorry
i
am
so
sorry
do
be
say
so
but
what
of
me
what
she
asked
rather
startled
he
smiled
again
he
felt
the
situation
and
was
a
trifle
dramatic
though
deadly
in
earnest
well
said
he
you
start
me
leave
me
at
a
loose
end
what
am
i
going
to
do
you
are
a
man
she
replied
he
laughed
what
does
that
mean
he
said
contemptuously
you
can
go
way
you
like
she
answered
oh
well
he
said
we
see
do
you
think
so
she
asked
rather
anxious
i
do
see
he
replied
they
went
out
with
some
things
in
the
hall
she
turned
to
him
with
a
break
in
her
voice
saying
oh
i
am
so
am
so
sorry
he
said
very
low
and
soft
never
mind
she
heard
the
laughter
of
those
preparing
the
charade
she
drew
away
and
went
in
the
drawing
room
saying
aloud
now
i
think
everything
is
can
sit
down
now
after
the
actors
had
played
the
last
charade
leslie
came
and
claimed
her
now
you
glad
to
have
me
back
that
i
am
she
said
do
leave
me
again
will
you
i
wo
he
replied
drawing
her
beside
him
i
have
left
my
handkerchief
in
the
he
continued
and
they
went
out
together
mother
gave
me
permission
for
the
men
to
smoke
you
know
said
marie
to
tom
i
am
surprised
that
a
scientist
should
smoke
is
it
a
waste
of
time
come
and
light
me
he
said
nay
she
replied
let
science
light
you
science
but
science
is
nothing
without
a
girl
to
set
it
do
burn
my
precious
nose
poor
george
cried
alice
does
he
want
a
ministering
angel
he
was
half
lying
in
a
big
arm
chair
i
do
he
replied
come
on
be
my
box
of
soothing
ointment
my
matches
are
all
loose
i
strike
it
on
my
heel
eh
now

or
i
shall
have
to
sit
on
your
knee
to
reach

poor
shall
beluxurious
and
the
dauntless
girl
perched
on
his
knee
what
if
i
singe
your
you
send
an
armada
do
look
he
suck
prettily
do
you
envy
me
he
asked
smiling
whimsically
shame
to
debar
you
he
said
almost
with
tenderness
smoke
with
me
he
offered
her
the
cigarette
from
his
lips
she
was
surprised
and
exceedingly
excited
by
his
tender
tone
she
took
the
cigarette
i
make
a
daws
she
said
do
call
yourself
a
cow
he
said
nasty
me

she
exclaimed
fit

he
replied
holding
her
then
you
must
have
growed
great
go
lettie
come
and
pinch
him
what
the
matter
asked
my
sister
he
wo
let
me
go
he
be
tired
first
lettie
answered
alice
was
released
but
she
did
not
move
she
sat
with
wrinkled
forehead
trying
his
cigarette
she
blew
out
little
tiny
whiffs
of
smoke
and
thought
about
it
she
sent
a
small
puff
down
her
nostrils
and
rubbed
her
nose
it
not
as
nice
as
it
looks
she
said
he
laughed
at
her
with
masculine
indulgence
pretty
boy
she
said
stroking
his
chin
am
i
he
murmured
languidly
cheek
she
cried
and
she
boxed
his
ears
then
oh
pore
fing
she
said
and
kissed
him
she
turned
round
to
wink
at
my
mother
and
at
lettie
she
found
the
latter
sitting
in
the
old
position
with
leslie
two
in
a
chair
he
was
toying
with
her
arm
holding
it
and
stroking
it
is
it
lovely
he
said
kissing
the
forearm
so
warm
and
yet
so
white
reminds
one
of
io
somebody
else
talking
about
heifers
murmured
alice
to
george
can
you
remember
said
leslie
speaking
low
that
man
in
merimée
who
wanted
to
bite
his
wife
and
taste
her
blood
i
do
said
lettie
have
you
a
strain
of
wild
beast
too
perhaps
he
laughed
i
wish
these
folks
had
gone
your
hair
is
all
loose
in
your
looks
lovely
like
that
alice
the
mocker
had
unbuttoned
the
cuff
of
the
thick
wrist
that
lay
idly
on
her
knee
and
had
pushed
his
sleeve
a
little
way
ah
she
said
what
a
pretty
arm
brown
as
an
overbaked
loaf
he
watched
her
smiling
hard
as
a
brick
she
added
do
you
like
it
he
drawled
no
she
said
emphatically
in
a
tone
that
meant
yes
it
makes
me
feel
shivery
he
smiled
again
she
superposed
her
tiny
pale
hands
on
his
he
lay
back
looking
at
them
curiously
do
you
feel
as
if
your
hands
were
full
of
silver
she
asked
almost
wistfully
mocking
better
than
that
he
replied
gently
and
your
heart
full
of
gold
she
mocked
of
hell
he
replied
briefly

at
him
searchingly
and

buzzing
in
your
window
to
keep
your
company
she
asked
he
laughed
she
said
slipping
down
and
leaving
him
do
go
he
too
late
the
irruption
of
alice
into
the
quiet
sentimental
party
was
like
taking
a
bright
light
into
a
sleeping
everybody
jumped
up
and
wanted
to
do
something
they
cried

for
a
dance

said
alice
we
began
to
dance
i
saw
lettie
watching
and
i
looked
round
george
was
waltzing
with
alice
dancing
passably
laughing
at
her
remarks
lettie
was
not
listening
to
what
her
lover
was
saying
to
her
she
was
watching
the
laughing
pair
at
the
end
she
went
to
george
why
she
said

happy
talking
to
the
mater
we
danced
the
mazurka
with
the
same
partners
he
did
it
better
than
i
much
stiffly
however
he
moved
quietly
through
the
dance
laughing
and
talking
abstractedly
all
the
time
with
alice
then
lettie
cried
a
change
of
partners
and
they
took
their
valeta
there
was
a
little
triumph
in
his
smile

said
i

surprised
she
answered
so

i
but
i
congratulate

she
pleaded
sadly
nothing
vital
do

like
dancing
with
me
he
asked
now

she
replied
by
heaven

he
said
smiling
you

she
said
leaning
on
him

he
it
because

altered
too
settled
one
way

she
smiling
and
adding
seriously

she
said
ay
he
agreed
but
doubtfully
i
wonder
where
it
will

she
said
lettie
he
cried
and
his
hand
closed
in
a
grip
on
her
say
no
good

too
late

what

done

and
stop
the
dance
do
say
another
word
he
did
least
to
her
their
dance
came
to
an
end
then
he
took
marie
who
talked
winsomely
to
him
as
he
waltzed
with
marie
he
regained
his
animated
spirits
he
was
very
lively
the
rest
of
the
evening
quite
astonishing
and
reckless
at

when

alice

and
will
departed
alice
bade
lettie
a
long
georgie
many
to
love
him
faithful
and
was
gone
george
and
emily
lingered
a
short
time
now
the
room
seemed
empty
and
quiet
and
all
the
laughter
seemed
to
have
gone
the
conversation
dribbled
away
there
was
an
awkwardness
well
said
george
heavily
at
last
is
nearly
will
soon
be
tomorrow
i
feel
a
bit
drunk
we
had
a
good
time
i
am
glad
said
lettie
they
put
on
their
clogs
and
leggings
and
wrapped
themselves
up
and
stood
in
the
hall
we
must
go
said
george
before
the
clock
strikes
at
my
glass
he
pointed
to
his
clogs
midnight
and
rags
and
fleeing
very
appropriate
i
shall
call
myself
cinderella
who
would
fit
i
believe
i
a
bit
world
looks
funny
we
looked
out
at
the
haunting
wanness
of
the
hills
beyond
nethermere
lettie
they
were
out
in
the
snow
which
peered
pale
and
eerily
from
the
depths
of
the
black
wood
he
called
out
of
the
darkness
leslie
slammed
the
door
and
drew
lettie
away
into
the
the
sound
of
his
low
vibrating
satisfaction
reached
us
as
he
murmured
to
her
and
laughed
low
then
he
kicked
the
door
of
the
room
shut
lettie
began
to
laugh
and
mock
and
talk
in
a
high
strained
voice
the
sound
of
their
laughter
mingled
was
strange
and
incongruous
then
her
voice
died
down
marie
sat
at
the
little
was
put
in
the
and
tinkling
the
false
quavering
old
notes
it
was
a
depressing
jingling
in
the
deserted
remains
of
the
feast
but
she
felt
sentimental
and
enjoyed
it
this
was
a
gap
between
and
tomorrow
a
dreary
gap
where
one
sat
and
looked
at
the
dreary
comedy
of
yesterdays
and
the
grey
tragedies
of
dawning
tomorrows
vacantly
missing
the
poignancy
of
an
actual
the
cart
returned
leslie
leslie
john
is
here
come
along
called
marie
there
was
no
answer
is
waiting
in
the
snow
all
right
but
you
must
come
at
once
she
went
to
the
door
and
spoke
to
him
then
he
came
out
looking
rather
sheepish
and
rather
angry
at
the
interruption
lettie
followed
tidying
her
hair
she
did
not
laugh
and
look
confused
as
most
girls
do
on
similar
occasions
she
seemed
very
tired
at
last
leslie
tore
himself
away
and
after
more
returns
for
a
farewell
kiss
mounted
the
carriage
which
stood
in
a
pool
of
yellow
light
blurred
and
splotched
with
shadows
and
drove
away
calling
something
about
tomorrow
part
ii
chapter
i
strange
blossoms
and
strange
new
budding
winter
lay
a
long
time
prostrate
on
the
earth
the
men
in
the
mines
of
tempest
warrall
and
came
out
on
strike
on
a
question
of
the
rearranging
of
the
working
system
down
below
the
distress
was
not
awful
for
the
men
were
on
the
whole
wise
and
but
there
was
a
dejection
over
the
face
of
the
and
some
suffered
keenly
everywhere
along
the
lanes
and
in
the
streets
loitered
gangs
of
men
unoccupied
and
spiritless
week
after
week
went
on
and
the
agents
of
the
miner
union
held
great
meetings
and
the
ministers
held
but
the
strike
continued
there
was
no
rest
always
the
crier
bell
was
ringing
in
the
street
always
the
servants
of
the
company
were
delivering
handbills
stating
the
case
clearly
and
always
the
people
talked
and
filled
the
months
with
bitter
and
then
hopeless
resenting
schools
gave
breakfasts
chapels
gave
soup
people
gave
children
enjoyed
it
but
we
who
knew
the
faces
of
the
old
men
and
the
privations
of
the
women
breathed
a
cold
disheartening
atmosphere
of
sorrow
and
trouble
determined
poaching
was
carried
on
in
the
squire
woods
and
warrens
annable
defended
his
game
heroically
one
man
was
at
home
with
a
leg
supposed
to
be
wounded
by
a
fall
on
the
slippery
really
by
a
in
the
woods
then
annable
caught
two
men
and
they
were
sentenced
to
two
months
imprisonment
on
both
the
lodge
gates
of
our
side
and
on
the
far
eberwich
posted
notices
that
trespassers
on
the
drive
or
in
the
grounds
would
be
liable
to
punishment
these
posters
were
soon
mudded
over
and
fresh
ones
fixed
the
men
loitering
on
the
road
by
nethermere
looked
angrily
at
lettie
as
she
passed
in
her
black
furs
which
leslie
had
given
her
and
their
remarks
were
pungent
she
heard
them
and
they
burned
in
her
heart
from
my
mother
she
inherited
democratic
views
which
she
now
proceeded
to
debate
warmly
with
her
lover
then
she
tried
to
talk
to
leslie
about
the
strike
he
heard
her
with
mild
superiority
smiled
and
said
she
did
not
know
women
jumped
to
conclusions
at
the
first
touch
of
feeling
men
must
look
at
a
thing
all
round
then
make
a
hasty
and
correct
decisions
women
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
these
things
business
was
not
for
them
in
fact
their
mission
was
above
unfortunately
lettie
was
the
wrong
woman
to
treat
thus
so
said
she
with
a
quiet
hopeless
tone
of
finality
there
now
you
understand
do
you
minnehaha
my
laughing
laugh
again
darling
and
do
worry
about
these
things
we
will
not
talk
about
them
any
more
eh
no
more
no
are
as
wise
as
an
angel
come
the
wood
is
thick
and
lonely
look
there
is
nobody
in
the
world
but
us
and
you
are
my
heaven
and
earth
and
hell
you
are
so
cold
you
are
gives
me
little
shivers
when
you
look
i
am
always
well
you
are
cruel
kiss
i
do
want
your
me
yourself
why
do
you
say
something
what
for
what
the
use
of
saying
anything
when
there
nothing
immediate
to
say
you
are
offended
it
feels
like
snow
she
answered
at
last
however
winter
began
to
gather
her
limbs
to
rise
and
drift
with
saddened
garments
northward
the
strike
was
over
the
men
had
compromised
it
was
a
gentle
way
of
telling
them
they
were
beaten
but
the
strike
was
over
the
birds
fluttered
and
dashed
the
catkins
on
the
hazel
loosened
their
winter
rigidity
and
swung
soft
tassels
all
through
the
day
sounded
long
sweet
whistlings
from
the
brushes
then
later
loud
laughing
shouts
of
bird
triumph
on
every
hand
i
remember
a
day
when
the
breast
of
the
hills
was
heaving
in
a
last
quick
waking
sigh
and
the
blue
eyes
of
the
waters
opened
bright
across
the
infinite
skies
of
march
great
rounded
masses
of
cloud
had
sailed
stately
all
day
domed
with
a
white
radiance
softened
with
faint
fleeting
shadows
as
if
companies
of
angels
were
gently
sweeping
past
adorned
with
resting
silken
shadows
like
those
of
a
full
white
breast
all
day
the
clouds
had
moved
on
to
their
vast
destination
and
i
had
clung
to
the
earth
yearning
and
impatient
i
took
a
brush
and
tried
to
paint
them
then
i
raged
at
myself
i
wished
that
in
all
the
wild
valley
where
cloud
shadows
were
travelling
like
pilgrims
something
would
call
me
forth
from
my
rooted
loneliness
through
all
the
grandeur
of
the
white
and
blue
day
the
poised
cloud
masses
swung
their
slow
flight
and
left
me
unnoticed
at
evening
they
were
all
gone
and
the
empty
sky
like
a
blue
bubble
over
us
swam
on
its
pale
bright
rims
leslie
came
and
asked
his
betrothed
to
go
out
with
him
under
the
darkening
wonderful
bubble
she
bade
me
accompany
her
and
to
escape
from
myself
i
went
it
was
warm
in
the
shelter
of
the
wood
and
in
the
crouching
hollows
of
the
hills
but
over
the
slanting
shoulders
of
the
hills
the
wind
swept
whipping
the
redness
into
our
faces
get
me
some
of
those
alder
catkins
leslie
said
lettie
as
we
came
down
to
the
stream
yes
those
where
they
hang
over
the
brook
they
are
ruddy
like
new
blood
freshening
under
the
skin
look
tassels
of
crimson
and
gold
she
pointed
to
the
dusty
hazel
catkins
mingled
with
the
alder
on
her
bosom
then
she
began
to
quote
christina
rossetti
a
birthday
i
glad
you
came
to
take
me
a
walk
she
does
strelley
mill
look
pretty
like
a
group
of
orange
and
scarlet
fungi
in
a
fairy
picture
do
you
know
i
have
been
no
not
for
quite
a
long
time
shall
we
call
now
the
daylight
will
be
gone
if
we
do
it
is
half
past
i
saw
other
morning
where
he
was
carting
made
haste
by
did
he
speak
to
you
look
at
him
no
he
said
nothing
i
glanced
at
just
the
same
brick
mind
that
rocks
i
glad
you
got
strong
boots
on
seeing
that
i
usually
wear
she
stood
poised
a
moment
on
a
large
stone
the
fresh
spring
brook
hastening
towards
her
deepening
sidling
round
her
you
wo
call
and
see
them
then
she
asked
no
i
like
to
hear
the
brook
tinkling
do
you
he
replied
ah
full
of
music
shall
we
go
on
he
said
impatient
but
submissive
i
catch
up
in
a
minute
said
i
went
in
and
found
emily
putting
some
bread
into
the
oven
come
out
for
a
walk
said
i
now
let
me
tell
was
she
ran
and
put
on
her
long
grey
coat
and
her
red
as
we
went
down
the
yard
george
called
to
me
i
come
back
i
shouted
he
came
to
the
gate
to
see
us
off
when
we
came
out
onto
the
path
we
saw
lettie
standing
on
the
top
bar
of
the
stile
balancing
with
her
hand
on
leslie
head
she
saw
us
she
saw
george
and
she
waved
to
us
leslie
was
looking
up
at
her
anxiously
she
waved
again
then
we
could
hear
her
laughing
and
telling
him
excitedly
to
stand
still
and
steady
her
while
she
turned
she
turned
round
and
leaped
with
a
great
flutter
like
a
big
bird
launching
down
from
the
top
of
the
stile
to
the
ground
and
into
his
arms
then
we
climbed
the
steep
bank
that
had
once
shone
yellow
with
wheat
and
now
waved
black
tattered
ranks
of
thistles
where
the
rabbits
ran
we
passed
the
little
cottages
in
the
hollow
scooped
out
of
the
hill
and
gained
the
highlands
that
look
out
over
leicestershire
to
charnwood
on
the
left
and
away
into
the
mountain
knob
of
derbyshire
straight
in
front
and
towards
the
right
the
upper
road
is
all
grassy
fallen
into
long
disuse
it
used
to
lead
from
the
abbey
to
the
hall
but
now
it
ends
blindly
on
the
half
way
along
is
the
old
white
house
farm
with
its
green
mounting
steps
mouldering
outside
ladies
have
mounted
here
and
ridden
towards
the
vale
of
now
a
labourer
holds
the
farm
we
came
to
the
quarries
and
looked
in
at
the
let
us
go
right
into
the
wood
out
of
the
quarry
said
leslie
i
have
not
been
since
i
was
a
little
lad
it
is
trespassing
said
emily
we
do
trespass
he
replied
grandiloquently
so
we
went
along
by
the
hurrying
brook
which
fell
over
little
cascades
in
its
haste
never
looking
once
at
the
primroses
that
were
glimmering
all
along
its
banks
we
turned
aside
and
climbed
the
hill
through
the
woods
velvety
green
sprigs
of
were
scattered
on
the
red
soil
we
came
to
the
top
of
a
slope
where
the
wood
thinned
as
i
talked
to
emily
i
became
dimly
aware
of
a
whiteness
over
the
ground
she
exclaimed
with
surprise
and
i
found
that
i
was
walking
in
the
first
shades
of
twilight
over
clumps
of
snowdrops
the
hazels
were
thin
and
only
here
and
there
an
oak
tree
uprose
all
the
ground
was
white
with
snowdrops
like
drops
of
manna
scattered
over
the
red
earth
on
the
clusters
of
leaves
there
was
a
deep
little
dell
sharp
sloping
like
a
cup
and
white
sprinkling
of
flowers
all
the
way
down
with
white
flowers
showing
pale
among
the
first
inpouring
of
shadow
at
the
bottom
the
earth
was
red
and
warm
pricked
with
the
dark
succulent
green
of
bluebell
sheaths
and
embroidered
with
clusters
of
spears
and
many
white
flowerets
high
above
above
the
light
tracery
of
hazel
the
weird
oaks
tangled
in
the
sunset
below
in
the
first
shadows
drooped
hosts
of
little
white
flowers
so
silent
and
sad
it
seemed
like
a
holy
communion
of
pure
wild
things
numberless
frail
and
folded
meekly
in
the
evening
light
other
flower
companies
are
glad
stately
barbaric
hordes
of
bluebells
cowslip
groups
even
light
tossing
but
snowdrops
are
sad
and
mysterious
we
have
lost
their
meaning
they
do
not
belong
to
us
who
ravish
them
the
girls
bent
among
them
touching
them
with
their
fingers
and
symbolising
the
yearning
which
i
felt
folded
in
the
twilight
these
conquered
flowerets
are
sad
like
forlorn
little
friends
of
dryads
what
do
they
mean
do
you
think
said
lettie
in
a
low
voice
as
her
white
fingers
touched
the
flowers
and
her
black
furs
fell
on
them
there
are
not
so
many
this
year
said
leslie
they
remind
me
of
mistletoe
which
is
never
ours
though
we
wear
it
said
emily
to
me
what
do
you
think
they
do
they
make
you
think
cyril
lettie
repeated
i
do
know
emily
says
they
belong
to
some
old
wild
lost
religion
they
were
the
symbol
of
tears
perhaps
to
some
strange
hearted
druid
folk
before
us
more
than
tears
said
lettie
more
than
tears
they
are
so
still
something
out
of
an
old
religion
that
we
have
lost
they
make
me
feel
afraid
what
should
you
have
to
fear
asked
leslie
if
i
knew
i
should
fear
she
answered
look
at
all
the
snowdrops
hung
in
dim
strange
flecks
among
the
dusky
look
at
up
retreating
powerless
they
belong
to
some
knowledge
we
have
lost
that
i
have
lost
and
that
i
need
i
feel
afraid
they
seem
like
something
in
fate
do
you
think
cyril
we
can
lose
things
off
the
mastodons
and
those
old
things
that
it
is
against
my
creed
said
i
i
believe
i
have
lost
something
said
she
come
said
leslie
do
trouble
with
fancies
come
with
me
to
the
bottom
of
this
cup
and
see
how
strange
it
will
be
with
the
sky
marked
with
branches
like
a
filigree
lid
she
rose
and
followed
him
down
the
steep
side
of
the
pit
crying
ah
you
are
treading
on
the
flowers
no
said
he
i
am
being
very
careful
they
sat
down
together
on
a
fallen
tree
at
the
bottom
she
leaned
forward
her
fingers
wandering
white
among
the
shadowed
grey
spaces
of
leaves
plucking
as
if
it
were
a
rite
flowers
here
and
there
he
could
not
see
her
face
do
you
care
for
me
he
asked
softly
you
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
and
laughed
strangely
you
do
not
seem
real
to
me
she
replied
in
a
strange
voice
for
some
time
they
sat
thus
both
bowed
and
silent
birds
skirred
off
from
the
bushes
and
emily
looked
up
with
a
great
start
as
a
quiet
sardonic
voice
said
above
us
a
my
eyes
if
it
ai
it
struck
me
i
a
cooin
th
birds
come
on
sweethearts
it
th
wrong
place
for
an
cooin
in
th
middle
o
these
snowdrops
let
yer
names
come
on
clear
off
you
fool
answered
leslie
from
below
jumping
up
in
anger
we
all
four
turned
and
looked
at
the
keeper
he
stood
in
the
rim
of
light
darkly
fine
powerful
form
menacing
us
he
did
not
move
but
like
some
malicious
pan
looked
down
on
us
and
said
very
two
makes
four
is
true
two
and
two
makes
four
come
on
come
on
out
o
this
bridal
bed
an

look

your
eyes
you
fool
replied
leslie
standing
up
and
helping
lettie
with
her
furs
at
any
rate
you
can
see
there
are
ladies
here
very
sorry
sir
you
ca
tell
a
lady
from
a
woman
at
this
distance
at
dusk
who
may
you
be
sir
clear
out
come
along
lettie
you
ca
stay
here
now
they
climbed
into
the
light
oh
very
sorry
yer
look
down
on
a
man
he
never
looks
the
same
i
thought
it
was
some
young
fools
come
here
damn
up
exclaimed
i
beg
your
pardon
lettie
will
you
have
my
arm
they
looked
very
elegant
the
pair
of
them
lettie
was
wearing
a
long
coat
which
fitted
close
she
had
a
small
hat
whose
feathers
flushed
straight
back
with
her
hair
the
keeper
looked
at
them
then
smiling
he
went
down
the
dell
with
great
strides
and
returned
saying
well
the
lady
might
as
well
take
her
gloves
she
took
them
from
him
shrinking
to
leslie
then
she
started
and
said
let
me
fetch
my
flowers
she
ran
for
the
handful
of
snowdrops
that
lay
among
the
roots
of
the
trees
we
all
watched
her
sorry
i
made
such
a
lady
said
annable
but
i
nearly
forgot
the
sight
o
the
squire
daughters
who
are
never
out
o
nights
i
should
think
you
never
have
seen
have
you
ever
been
a
groom
no
groom
but
a
bridegroom
sir
and
then
i
think
i
rather
groom
a
horse
than
a
lady
for
i
got
well
you
will
excuse
me
sir
and
you
deserved
doubt
i
got
i
wish
you
better
luck
sir
one
more
a
man
here
in
wood
though
than
in
my
lady
parlour
it
strikes
me
a
lady
parlour
laughed
leslie
indulgent
in
his
amusement
at
the
facetious
keeper
oh
yes
you
walk
into
my
you
very
smart
for
a
keeper
oh
yes
was
once
a
lady
man
but
i
rather
watch
th
rabbits
an
th
birds
an
it
easier
breeding
brats
in
th
kennels
than
in
town
they
are
yours
are
they
said
i
you
know
do
you
sir
are
they
a
lovely
little
litter
they
a
pretty
bag
o
ferrets
as
what
i
said
they
should
up
like
a
bunch
o
young
foxes
to
run
as
they
would
emily
had
joined
lettie
and
they
kept
aloof
from
the
man
they
instinctively
hated
they
get
nicely
trapped
one
of
these
days
said
i
they
can
fend
for
themselves
like
wild
beasts
do
he
replied
grinning
you
are
not
doing
your
duty
it
strikes
me
put
in
leslie
sententiously
the
man
laughed
duties
of
parents

i
need
of

eight
and
one
not
far
off
she
breeds
well
the
ow
every
two
in
fourteen
well
has
she
you
done
pretty
badly
i
think
it
natural
when
a
man
more
than
nature
he
a
devil
be
a
good
animal
says
i
whether
it
man
or
woman
you

as
long
as
yer

and
what
then
do
as
th
animals
do
i
watch
my
let

beauties
they
as
a
young
ash
pole
every
one
they
learn
to
dirty
themselves
wi
smirking
if
i
can
help
it
they
can
be
like
birds
or
weasels
or
vipers
or
squirrels
so
long
as
they
ai
human
rot
that
what
i
say
it
one
way
of
looking
at
things
said
leslie
ay
look
at
the
women
looking
at
us
i
something
between
a
bull
and
a
couple
of
worms
stuck
together
i
am
see
that
spink
he
raised
his
voice
for
the
girls
to
hear
pretty
is
he
what
for
what
for
do
you
wear
a
fancy
vest
and
twist
your
moustache
sir
what
for
at
the
bottom
a
woman
not
to
come
in
a
wood
till
she
can
look
at
natural
might
see
night
sir
he
marched
off
into
the
darkness
coarse
fellow
that
said
leslie
when
he
had
rejoined
lettie
but
he
a
character
he
makes
you
shudder
she
replied
but
yet
you
are
interested
in
him
i
believe
he
has
a
history
he
seems
to
lack
something
said
emily
i
thought
him
rather
a
fine
fellow
said
i
splendidly
built
fellow
but
soul
remarked
leslie
dismissing
the
question
no
assented
emily
no
among
the
snowdrops
lettie
was
thoughtful
and
i
smiled
it
was
a
beautiful
evening
still
with
red
shaken
clouds
in
the
west
the
moon
in
heaven
was
turning
wistfully
back
to
the
east
dark
purple
woods
lay
around
us
painting
out
the
distance
the
near
wild
ruined
land
looked
sad
and
strange
under
the
pale
afterglow
the
turf
path
was
fine
and
springy
let
us
run
said
lettie
and
joining
hands
we
raced
wildly
along
with
a
flutter
and
a
breathless
laughter
till
we
were
happy
and
forgetful
when
we
stopped
we
exclaimed
at
once
hark
a
child
said
lettie
at
the
kennels
said
i
we
hurried
forward
from
the
house
came
the
mad
yelling
and
yelping
of
children
and
the
wild
hysterical
shouting
of
a
woman
tha
little
little
tha
shanna
and
this
was
accompanied
by
the
hollow
sound
of
blows
and
a
pandemonium
of
howling
we
rushed
in
and
found
the
woman
in
a
tousled
frenzy
belabouring
a
youngster
with
an
enamelled
pan
the
lad
was
rolled
up
like
a
young
woman
held
him
by
the
foot
and
like
a
flail
came
the
hollow
utensil
thudding
on
his
shoulders
and
back
he
lay
in
the
firelight
and
howled
while
scattered
in
various
groups
with
the
leaping
firelight
twinkling
over
their
tears
and
their
open
mouths
were
the
other
children
crying
too
the
mother
was
in
a
state
of
hysteria
her
hair
streamed
over
her
face
and
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
stare
of
overwrought
irritation
up
and
down
went
her
long
arm
like
a
windmill
sail
i
ran
and
held
it
when
she
could
hit
no
more
the
woman
dropped
the
pan
from
her
nerveless
hand
and
staggered
trembling
to
the
squab
she
looked
desperately
weary
and
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
continually
emily
hushed
the
children
while
lettie
hushed
the
mother
holding
her
hard
cracked
hands
as
she
swayed
to
and
fro
gradually
the
mother
became
still
and
sat
staring
in
front
of
her
then
aimlessly
she
began
to
finger
the
jewels
on
lettie
finger
emily
was
bathing
the
cheek
of
a
little
girl
who
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
loudly
when
she
saw
the
speck
of
blood
on
the
cloth
but
presently
she
became
quiet
too
and
emily
could
empty
the
water
from
the
late
instrument
of
castigation
and
at
last
light
the
lamp
i
found
sam
under
the
table
in
a
little
heap
i
put
out
my
hand
for
him
and
he
wriggled
away
like
a
lizard
into
the
passage
after
a
while
i
saw
him
in
a
corner
lying
whimpering
with
little
savage
cries
of
pain
i
cut
off
his
retreat
and
captured
him
bearing
him
struggling
into
the
kitchen
then
weary
with
pain
he
became
passive
we
undressed
him
and
found
his
beautiful
white
body
all
discoloured
with
bruises
the
mother
began
to
sob
again
with
a
chorus
of
babies
the
girls
tried
to
soothe
the
weeping
while
i
rubbed
butter
into
the
silent
wincing
boy
then
his
mother
caught
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
passionately
and
cried
with
abandon
the
boy
let
himself
be
he
too
began
to
sob
till
his
little
body
was
all
shaken
they
folded
themselves
together
the
poor
dishevelled
mother
and
the
boy
and
wept
themselves
still
then
she
took
him
to
bed
and
the
girls
helped
the
other
little
ones
into
their
nightgowns
and
soon
the
house
was
still
i
canna
manage
i
canna
said
the
mother
mournfully
they
beyont
dunna
know
what
to
do
wi
an
niver

does

ter
cares
not
a
thing
for
a

mock

said
lettie
setting
the
bonny
boy
on
his
feet
and
holding
up
his
trailing
nightgown
behind
him
do

want
to
walk
to
your
the
child
a
handsome
little
fellow
of
some
sixteen
months
toddled
across
to
his
mother
waving
his
hands
as
he
went
and
laughing
while
his
large
hazel
eyes
glowed
with
pleasure
his
mother
caught
him
pushed
the
silken
brown
hair
back
from
his
forehead
and
laid
his
cheek
against
hers
ah

said

a
stranger
to

own
flesh

blood
the
girl
with
the
wounded
cheek
had
found
comfort
in
leslie
she
was
seated
on
his
knee
looking
at
him
with
solemn
blue
eyes
her
solemnity
increased
by
the
quaint
round
head
whose
black
hair
was
cut
short
my
chalk

she
wriggled
down
and
holding
up
her
trailing
gown
with
one
hand
trotted
to
a
corner
piled
with
a
child
rubbish
and
hauled
out
a
hideous
carven
caricature
of
a
woman
and
brought
it
to
leslie
the
face
of
the
object
was
streaked
with
red

minute
come
on
she
hustled
the
children
to
bed
swept
the
litter
into
a
corner
and
began
to
lay
the
table
the
cloth
was
spotless
and
she
put
him
a
silver
spoon
in
the
saucer
we
had
only
just
got
out
of
the
house
when
he
drew
near
i
saw
his
massive
figure
in
the
doorway
and
the
big
prolific
woman
moved
subserviently
about
the
room
hullo
visitors
i
never
axed
come
in
th
childer
cryin
i
never

we
hurried
away
into
the
night
ah
it
always
the
woman
bears
the
burden
said
lettie
bitterly
if
he
helped
she
have
been
a
fine
woman
but
she
dragged
to
bits
men
are
marriage
just
gives
scope
to
them
said
emily
oh
you
would
take
that
as
a
fair
sample
of
marriage
replied
leslie
think
of
you
and
me
minnehaha
ay
meant
to
tell
do
you
think
of
greymede
old
vicarage
for
us
it
a
lovely
old
place
exclaimed
lettie
and
we
passed
out
of
hearing
we
stumbled
over
the
rough
path
the
moon
was
bright
and
we
stepped
apprehensively
on
the
shadows
thrown
from
the
trees
for
they
lay
so
black
and
substantial
occasionally
a
moonbeam
would
trace
out
a
suave
white
branch
that
the
rabbits
had
gnawed
quite
bare
in
the
hard
winter
we
came
out
of
the
woods
into
the
full
heavens
the
northern
sky
was
full
of
a
gush
of
green
light
in
front
eclipsed
orion
leaned
over
his
bed
and
the
moon
followed
when
the
northern
lights
are
up
said
emily
i
feel
so
do
fill
you
with
awe
do
they
yes
said
i
they
make
you
wonder
and
look
and
expect
something
what
do
you
expect
she
said
softly
and
looked
up
and
saw
me
smiling
and
she
looked
down
again
biting
her
lips
when
we
came
to
the
parting
of
the
roads
emily
begged
them
just
to
step
into
the
for
a
lettie
consented
the
kitchen
window
was
uncurtained
and
the
blind
as
usual
was
not
drawn
we
peeped
in
through
the
cords
of
budding
honeysuckle
george
and
alice
were
sitting
at
the
table

to
the
game
she
knitted
her
brows
and
cogitated
pooh
she
said
that

her
piece
and
said
triumphantly
now

he
surveyed
the
game
and
with
deliberation

with
a
leap
of
her
knight

head
and

hair
and
threw

flowers

the
table

said
the
mother
coming
into
the
room
from
the
dairy
what
we
all
asked
nickie
ben
been
and
eaten
the
sile
cloth
yes
when
i
went
to
wash
it
there
sat
nickie
ben
gulping
and
wiping
the
froth
off
his
whiskers
george
laughed
loudly
and
heartily
he
laughed
till
he
was
tired
lettie
looked
and
wondered
when
he
would
be
done
i
imagined
he
gasped
how
he
feel
with
half
a
yard
of
muslin
creeping
down
his
throttle
this
laughter
was
most
incongruous
he
went
off
into
another
burst
alice
laughed
was
easy
to
infect
her
with
laughter
then
the
father
in
walked
nickie
ben
stepping
all
roared
again
till
the
rafters
shook
only
lettie
looked
impatiently
for
the
end
george
swept
his
bare
arms
across
the
table
and
the
scattered
little
flowers
fell
broken
to
the
ground
a
shame
exclaimed
lettie
what
said
he
looking
round
your
flowers
do
you
feel
sorry
for
them
too
tender
hearted
is
she
cyril
always
dumb
animals
and
things
said
i
do
you
wish
you
was
a
little
dumb
animal
georgie
said
alice
he
smiled
putting
away
the
shall
we
go
dear
said
lettie
to
leslie
if
you
are
ready
he
replied
rising
with
alacrity
i
am
tired
she
said
plaintively
he
attended
to
her
with
little
tender
solicitations
have
we
walked
too
far
he
asked
no
it
not
that
the
snowdrops
and
the
man
and
the
everything
i
feel
just
a
bit
exhausted
she
kissed
alice
and
emily
and
the
mother
alice
she
said
it
not
altogether
my
fault
strangers
you
just
the
only
you
imagine
and
then
what
can
i
do
she
said
farewell
to
george
and
looked
at
him
through
a
quiver
of
suppressed
tears
george
was
somewhat
flushed
with
triumph
over
lettie
she
had
gone
home
with
tears
shaken
from
her
eyes
unknown
to
her
lover
at
the
farm
george
laughed
with
alice
we
escorted
alice
home
to
like
a
blooming
little
monkey
dangling
from
two
boughs
as
she
put
it
when
we
swung
her
along
on
our
arms
we
laughed
and
said
many
preposterous
things
george
wanted
to
kiss
her
at
parting
but
she
tipped
him
under
the
chin
and
said
sweet
as
one
does
to
a
canary
then
she
laughed
with
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
and
ran
indoors
she
is
a
little
devil
said
he
we
took
the
long
way
home
by
greymede
and
passed
the
dark
schools
come
on
said
he
let
go
in
the
inn
and
have
a
look
at
my
cousin
meg
it
was
half
past
ten
when
he
marched
me
across
the
road
and
into
the
sanded
passage
of
the
little
inn
the
place
had
been
an
important
farm
in
the
days
of
george
but
since
his
decease
it
had
declined
under
the
governance
of
the
widow
and
a
the
old
was
propped
and
supported
by
a
splendid
the
near
kin
of
meg
were
all
in
california
so
she
a
bonny
delightful
girl
of
stayed
near
her
as
we
tramped
grittily
down
the
passage
the
red
head
of
bill
poked
out
of
the
bar
and
he
said
as
he
recognised
george
non
abed
yit
we
went
forward
and
unlatched
the
kitchen
door
the
was
seated
in
her
little
armchair
sipping
her
well
george
my
lad
she
cried
in
her
querulous
voice
tha
niver

it
thai

ter
that
for
summat
for
sure
else
what
brings
thee
ter
see
me

he
said
com

see
thee
nowt
else
wheer
meg
ah
did
ter
say
ter
see
me
meg
who
this
young
gentleman
i
was
formally
introduced
and
shook
the
clammy
corded
hand
of
the
old
lady
tha
looks
delikit
she
observed
shaking
her
cap
and
its
scarlet
geraniums
sadly
cum
now
sit
thee
down
an
dunna
look
so
long
o
leg
i
sat
down
on
the
sofa
on
the
cushions
covered
with
blue
and
red
checks
the
room
was
very
hot
and
i
stared
about
uncomfortably
the
old
lady
sat
peering
at
nothing
in
reverie
she
was
a
bosomless
dame
clad
in
thick
black
armour
and
wearing
an
immense
twisted
gold
brooch
in
the
lace
at
her
neck
we
heard
heavy
quick
footsteps
above
er
commin
remarked
the
old
lady
rousing
from
her
apathy
the
footsteps
came
then
cautiously
round
the
bend
meg
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
started
with
surprise
saying
well
i
sumbody
but
i
never
thought
it
was
you
more
colour
still
flamed
into
her
glossy
cheeks
and
she
smiled
in
her
fresh
frank
way
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
who
had
more
physical
charm
there
was
a
voluptuous
fascination
in
her
every
outline
and
movement
one
never
listened
to
the
words
that
came
from
her
lips
one
watched
the
ripe
motion
of
those
red
fruits
get
a
drop
o
whiskey
a
drop
i
declined
firmly
but
did
not
escape
nay
declared
the
old
dame
i
s
none
o
thy
no
should
ter
like
it
th
word
an
tha
it
i
did
not
say
the
word
then
claret
pronounced
my
hostess
though
it
stuff
ter
go
to
ter
bed
on
claret
it
was
meg
went
out
again
to
see
about
closing
the
sighed
and
sighed
again
for
no
perceptible
reason
but
the
whiskey
it
well
you
come
ter
see
me
now
she
moaned
for
you
none
a
chance
next
time

but
my
she
shook
that
geraniumed
erection
and
i
wondered
what
sardonic
fate
left
it
behind
an
i
forced
ter
say
it
i
s
be
thankful
to
be
gone
she
added
after
a
few
sighs
this
weariness
of
the
flesh
was
touching
the
cruel
truth
is
however
that
the
old
lady
clung
to
life
like
a
louse
to
a
pig
back
dying
she
faintly
but
emphatically
declared
herself
a
bit
bit
better
i
s
be
up
i
should
a
gone
before
now
she
continued
but
for
that
blessed
canna

to

she
sniffed
and
turned
scornfully
to
her
glass
george
grinned
and
looked
conscious
as
he
swallowed
a
gulp
of
whiskey
it
crackled
in
his
throat
the
sound
annoyed
the
old
lady
tha
might
be
scar
at
summat
she
said
tha
niver
six
drops

in

she
turned
again
with
a
sniff
to
her
glass
he
frowned
with
irritation
half
filled
his
glass
with
liquor
and
drank
again
i
dare
bet
as
tha
niver
kissed
a
wench
in
thy
proper
she
tossed
the
last
drops
of
her
toddy

naïve
and
unconscious
waited
on
us
deliciously
her
cheeks
gleamed
like
satin
when
she
laughed
save
when
the
dimples
held
the
shadow
her
suave
tawny
neck
was
bare
and
bewitching
she
turned
suddenly
to
george
as
he
asked
her
a
question
and
they
found
their
faces
close
together
he
kissed
her
and
when
she
started
back
jumped
and
kissed
her
neck
with
warmth
cried
the
old
woman
in
delight
and
she
clutched
her
wineglass

she
cried

to
him

four
chinked
and

george
poured

in
a
tumbler
and
drank

all
the
energy
and
passion
that

bound
down
by
his
caution
and

loudly
and
winked
at
george
who
with
his
lips
wet
with
wine
got
up
and
kissed
meg
soundly
saying
there

in
a
corner
and
pulled

his
boots

kiss

george
said
the
old
as
he
did
so
she
whispered
in
his
ear
whereat
he
laughed
loudly
she
poured
whiskey
into
her
glass
and
called
to
the
to
drink
it
then
pulling
herself
up
heavily
she
leaned
on
meg
and
went
upstairs
she
had
been
a
big
woman
one
could
see
but
now
her
shapeless
broken
figure
looked
pitiful
beside
meg
luxuriant
form
we
heard
them
slowly
laboriously
climb
the
stairs
george
sat
pulling
his
moustache
and
his
eyes
were
alight
with
that
peculiar
childish
look
they
had
when
he
was
experiencing
new
and
doubtful
sensations
then
he
poured
himself
more
whiskey
i
say
steady
i
admonished
what
for
he
replied
indulging
himself
like
a
spoiled
child
and
laughing
bill
who
had
sat
for
some
time
looking
at
the
hole
in
his
stocking
drained
his
glass
and
with
a
sad
creaked
off
upstairs
presently
meg
came
down
and
i
rose
and
said
we
must
be
going
i
just
come
an
lock
the
door
after
you
said
she
standing
uneasily
waiting
george
got
up
he
gripped
the
edge
of
the
table
to
steady
himself
then
he
got
his
balance
and
with
his
eyes
on
meg
said
he
nodded
his
head
to
her
come
here
i
want
ter
ax
thee
sumwhat
she
looked
at
him
half
doubtful
he
put
his
arm
round
her
and
looking
down
into
her
eyes
with
his
face
very
close
to
hers
said
let
a
kiss
quite
unresisting
she
yielded
him
her
mouth
looking
at
him
intently
with
her
bright
brown
eyes
he
kissed
her
and
pressed
her
closely
to
him
i
going
to
marry
thee
he
said
go
on
she
replied
softly
half
glad
half
doubtful
i
am
an
all
he
repeated
pressing
her
more
tightly
to
him
i
went
down
the
passage
and
stood
in
the
open
doorway
looking
out
into
the
night
it
seemed
a
long
time
then
i
heard
the
thin
voice
of
the
old
woman
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
meg
meg
send
off
now
come
on
in
the
silence
that
followed
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
and
then
they
came
into
the
passage
my
lad
good
luck
to
thee
cried
the
voice
like
a
ghoul
from
upper
regions
he
kissed
his
betrothed
a
rather
hurried
at
the
door
she
replied
softly
watching
him
retreat
then
we
heard
her
shoot
the
heavy
bolts
you
know
he
began
and
he
tried
to
clear
his
throat
his
voice
was
husky
and
strangulated
with
excitement
he
tried
again
you
a
clinker
i
did
not
reply
but
he
took
no
notice
damn
he
ejaculated
what
did
i
let
her
go
for
we
walked
along
in
excitement
abated
somewhat
it
the
way
she
swings
her
the
curves
as
she
stands
when
you
look
at
know
i
suppose
i
knew
but
it
was
unnecessary
to
say
so
you
ever
i
dream
in
the
always
meg
she
seems
to
look
so
soft
and
to
curve
her
gradually
his
feet
began
to
drag
when
we
came
to
the
place
where
the
colliery
railway
crossed
the
road
he
stumbled
and
pitched
forward
only
just
recovering
himself
i
took
hold
of
his
arm
good
lord
cyril
am
i
drunk
he
said
not
quite
said
i
no
he
muttered
could
be
but
his
feet
dragged
again
and
he
began
to
stagger
from
side
to
side
i
took
hold
of
his
arm
he
murmured
subsiding
again
muttered
with
slovenly
articulation
feel
fit
to
drop
with
sleep
along
the
dead
silent
roadway
and
through
the
uneven
blackness
of
the
wood
we
lurched
and
stumbled
he
was
very
heavy
and
difficult
to
direct
when
at
last
we
came
to
the
brook
we
splashed
straight
through
the
water
i
urged
him
to
walk
steadily
and
quietly
across
the
yard
he
did
his
best
and
we
made
a
fairly
still
entry
into
the
farm
he
dropped
with
all
his
weight
on
the
sofa
and
leaning
down
began
to
unfasten
his
leggings
in
the
midst
of
his
fumblings
he
fell
asleep
and
i
was
afraid
he
would
pitch
forward
on
to
his
head
i
took
off
his
leggings
and
his
wet
boots
and
his
collar
then
as
i
was
pushing
and
shaking
him
awake
to
get
off
his
coat
i
heard
a
creaking
on
the
stairs
and
my
heart
sank
for
i
thought
it
was
his
mother
but
it
was
emily
in
her
long
white
nightgown
she
looked
at
us
with
great
dark
eyes
of
terror
and
whispered
what
the
matter
i
shook
my
head
and
looked
at
him
his
head
had
dropped
down
on
his
chest
again
is
he
hurt
she
asked
her
voice
becoming
audible
and
dangerous
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
heavy
angry
eyes
george
she
said
sharply
in
bewilderment
and
fear
his
eyes
seemed
to
contract
evilly
is
he
drunk
she
whispered
shrinking
away
and
looking
at
me
have
you
made
him
i
nodded
i
too
was
angry
oh
if
mother
gets
up
i
must
get
him
to
bed
oh
how
could
you
this
sibilant
whispering
irritated
him
and
me
i
tugged
at
his
coat
he
snarled
incoherently
and
swore
she
caught
her
breath
he
looked
at
her
sharply
and
i
was
afraid
he
would
wake
himself
into
a
rage
go
upstairs
i
whispered
to
her
she
shook
her
head
i
could
see
him
taking
heavy
breaths
and
the
veins
of
his
neck
were
swelling
i
was
furious
at
her
disobedience
go
at
once
i
said
fiercely
and
she
went
still
hesitating
and
looking
back
i
had
hauled
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
so
i
let
him
sink
again
into
stupidity
while
i
took
off
my
boots
then
i
got
him
to
his
feet
and
walking
behind
him
impelled
him
slowly
upstairs
i
lit
a
candle
in
his
bedroom
there
was
no
sound
from
the
other
rooms
so
i
undressed
him
and
got
him
in
bed
at
last
somehow
i
covered
him
up
and
put
over
him
the
rug
because
the
night
was
cold
almost
immediately
he
began
to
breathe
heavily
i
dragged
him
over
to
his
side
and
pillowed
his
head
comfortably
he
looked
like
a
tired
boy
asleep
i
stood
still
now
i
felt
myself
alone
and
looked
round
up
to
the
low
roof
rose
the
carven
pillars
of
dark
mahogany
there
was
a
chair
by
the
bed
and
a
little
yellow
chest
of
drawers
by
the
windows
that
was
all
the
furniture
save
the
rug
on
the
floor
in
the
drawers
i
noticed
a
book
it
was
a
copy
of
omar
khayyam
that
lettie
had
given
him
in
her
khayyam
days
a
little
shilling
book
with
coloured
illustrations
i
blew
out
the
candle
when
i
had
looked
at
him
again
as
i
crept
on
to
the
landing
emily
peeped
from
her
room
whispering
is
he
in
bed
i
nodded
and
whispered
then
i
went
home
heavily
after
the
evening
at
the
farm
lettie
and
leslie
drew
closer
together
they
eddied
unevenly
down
the
little
stream
of
courtship
jostling
and
drifting
together
and
apart
he
was
unsatisfied
and
strove
with
every
effort
to
bring
her
close
to
him
submissive
gradually
she
yielded
and
submitted
to
him
she
folded
round
her
and
him
the
snug
curtain
of
the
present
and
they
sat
like
children
playing
a
game
behind
the
hangings
of
an
old
bed
she
shut
out
all
distant
outlooks
as
an
arab
unfolds
his
tent
and
conquers
the
mystery
and
space
of
the
desert
so
she
lived
gleefully
in
a
little
tent
of
present
pleasures
and
fancies
occasionally
only
occasionally
she
would
peep
from
her
tent
into
the
out
space
then
she
sat
poring
over
books
and
nothing
would
be
able
to
draw
her
away
or
she
sat
in
her
room
looking
out
of
the
window
for
hours
together
she
pleaded
headaches
mother
said
liver
he
angry
like
a
spoilt
child
denied
his
wish
declared
it
moodiness
and
perversity
chapter
ii
a
shadow
in
spring
with
spring
came
trouble
the
saxtons
declared
they
were
being
bitten
off
the
estate
by
rabbits
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
despair
the
father
bought
a
gun
although
he
knew
that
the
squire
would
not
for
one
moment
tolerate
the
shooting
of
that
manna
the
rabbits
yet
he
was
out
in
the
first
cold
morning
twilight
banging
away
at
first
he
but
scared
the
brutes
and
brought
annable
on
the
scene
then
blooded
by
the
use
of
the
weapon
he
played
havoc
among
the
furry
beasts
bringing
home
some
eight
or
nine
couples
george
entirely
approved
of
this
measure
it
rejoiced
him
even
yet
he
had
never
had
the
initiative
to
begin
the
like
himself
or
even
to
urge
his
father
to
it
he
prophesied
trouble
and
possible
loss
of
the
farm
it
disturbed
him
somewhat
to
think
they
must
look
out
for
another
place
but
he
postponed
the
thought
of
the
evil
day
till
the
time
should
be
upon
him
a
vendetta
was
established
between
the
mill
and
the
keeper
annable
the
latter
cherished
his
rabbits
call
vermin
he
said
i
only
know
one
sort
of
the
talkin
sort
so
he
set
himself
to
thwart
and
harass
the
rabbit
slayers
it
was
about
this
time
i
cultivated
the
acquaintance
of
the
keeper
all
the
world
hated
the
people
in
the
villages
he
was
like
a
devil
of
the
woods
some
miners
had
sworn
vengeance
on
him
for
having
caused
their
committal
to
gaol
but
he
had
a
great
attraction
for
me
his
magnificent
physique
his
great
vigour
and
vitality
and
his
swarthy
gloomy
face
drew
me
he
was
a
man
of
one
idea
all
civilisation
was
the
painted
fungus
of
rottenness
he
hated
any
sign
of
culture
i
won
his
respect
one
afternoon
when
he
found
me
trespassing
in
the
woods
because
i
was
watching
some
maggots
at
work
in
a
dead
rabbit
that
led
us
to
a
discussion
of
life
he
was
a
thorough
scorned
religion
and
all
mysticism
he
spent
his
days
sleeping
making
intricate
traps
for
weasels
and
men
putting
together
a
gun
or
doing
some
amateur
forestry
cutting
down
timber
splitting
it
in
logs
for
use
in
the
hall
and
planting
young
trees
when
he
thought
he
reflected
on
the
decay
of
decline
of
the
human
race
into
folly
and
weakness
and
rottenness
be
a
good
animal
true
to
your
animal
instinct
was
his
motto
with
all
this
he
was
fundamentally
very
he
made
me
also
wretched
it
was
this
power
to
communicate
his
unhappiness
that
made
me
somewhat
dear
to
him
i
think
he
treated
me
as
an
affectionate
father
treats
a
delicate
son
i
noticed
he
liked
to
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
or
my
knee
as
we
talked
yet
withal
he
asked
me
questions
and
saved
his
thoughts
to
tell
me
and
believed
in
my
knowledge
like
any
acolyte
i
went
up
to
the
quarry
woods
one
evening
in
early
april
taking
a
look
for
annable
i
could
not
find
him
however
in
the
wood
so
i
left
the
wildlands
and
went
along
by
the
old
red
wall
of
the
kitchen
garden
along
the
main
road
as
far
as
the
mouldering
church
which
stands
high
on
a
bank
by
the
just
where
the
trees
tunnel
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
of
the
highway
startles
the
travellers
at
noon
great
trees
growing
on
the
banks
suddenly
fold
over
everything
at
this
point
in
the
swinging
road
and
in
the
obscurity
rots
the
hall
church
black
and
melancholy
above
the
shrinking
head
of
the
traveller
the
grassy
path
to
the
churchyard
was
still
clogged
with
decayed
leaves
the
church
is
abandoned
as
i
drew
near
an
owl
floated
softly
out
of
the
black
tower
grass
overgrew
the
threshold
i
pushed
open
the
door
grinding
back
a
heap
of
fallen
plaster
and
rubbish
and
entered
the
place
in
the
twilight
the
pews
were
leaning
in
ghostly
disorder
the
dragged
from
their
ledges
scattered
on
the
floor
in
the
dust
and
rubble
torn
by
mice
and
birds
birds
scuffled
in
the
darkness
of
the
roof
i
looked
up
in
the
upward
well
of
the
tower
i
could
see
a
bell
hanging
i
stooped
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
plaster
from
the
ragged
confusion
of
feathers
and
broken
nests
and
remnants
of
dead
birds
up
into
the
vault
overhead
i
tossed
pieces
of
plaster
until
one
hit
the
bell
and
it
tonged
out
its
faint
remonstrance
there
was
a
rustle
of
many
birds
like
spirits
i
sounded
the
bell
again
and
dark
forms
moved
with
cries
of
alarm
overhead
and
something
fell
heavily
i
shivered
in
the
dark
place
and
hurried
to
get
out
of
doors
i
clutched
my
hands
with
relief
and
pleasure
when
i
saw
the
sky
above
me
quivering
with
the
last
crystal
lights
and
the
lowest
red
of
sunset
behind
the
i
drank
the
fresh
air
that
sparkled
with
the
sound
of
the
blackbirds
and
thrushes
whistling
their
strong
bright
notes
i
strayed
round
to
where
the
headstones
from
their
eminence
leaned
to
look
on
the
hall
below
where
great
windows
shone
yellow
light
on
to
the
flagged
and
the
little
fish
pool
a
stone
staircase
descended
from
the
graveyard
to
the
court
between
stone
balustrades
whose
grey
columns
still
swelled
gracefully
and
with
dignity
encrusted
with
lichens
the
staircase
was
filled
with
ivy
and
rambling
ferns
were
unrolling
round
the
big
square
halting
place
half
way
down
where
the
stairs
turned
a
peacock
startled
from
the
back
premises
of
the
hall
came
flapping
up
the
terraces
to
the
churchyard
then
a
heavy
footstep
crossed
the
flags
it
was
the
keeper
i
whistled
the
whistle
he
knew
and
he
broke
his
way
through
the
vicious
up
the
stairs
the
peacock
flapped
beyond
me
on
to
the
neck
of
an
old
bowed
angel
rough
and
dark
an
angel
which
had
long
ceased
sorrowing
for
the
lost
lucy
and
had
died
also
the
bird
bent
its
voluptuous
neck
and
peered
about
then
it
lifted
up
its
head
and
yelled
the
sound
tore
the
dark
sanctuary
of
twilight
the
old
grey
grass
seemed
to
stir
and
i
could
fancy
the
smothered
primroses
and
violets
beneath
it
waking
and
gasping
for
fear
the
keeper
looked
at
me
and
smiled
he
nodded
his
head
towards
the
peacock
saying
hark
at
that
damned
thing
again
the
bird
lifted
its
crested
head
and
gave
a
cry
at
the
same
time
turning
awkwardly
on
its
ugly
legs
so
that
it
showed
us
the
full
wealth
of
its
tail
glimmering
like
a
stream
of
coloured
stars
over
the
sunken
face
of
the
angel
the
proud
fool
at
it
perched
on
an
angel
too
as
if
it
were
a
pedestal
for
vanity
that
the
soul
of
a
it
the
devil
he
was
silent
for
a
time
and
we
watched
the
great
bird
moving
uneasily
before
us
in
the
twilight
that
the
very
soul
of
a
lady
he
said
the
very
very
soul
damn
the
thing
to
perch
on
that
old
angel
i
should
like
to
wring
its
neck
again
the
bird
screamed
and
shifted
awkwardly
on
its
legs
it
seemed
to
stretch
its
beak
at
us
in
derision
annable
picked
up
a
piece
of
sod
and
flung
it
at
the
bird
saying
get
out
you
screeching
devil
god
he
laughed
there
must
be
plenty
of
hearts
twisting
under
here
he
stamped
on
a
grave
when
they
hear
that
row
he
kicked
another
sod
from
a
grave
and
threw
at
the
big
bird
the
peacock
flapped
away
over
the
tombs
down
the
terraces
just
look
he
said
the
miserable
brute
has
dirtied
that
angel
a
woman
to
the
end
i
tell
you
all
vanity
and
screech
and
defilement
he
sat
down
on
a
vault
and
lit
his
pipe
but
before
he
had
smoked
two
minutes
it
was
out
again
i
had
not
seen
him
in
a
state
of
perturbation
before
the
church
said
i
is
rotten
i
suppose
they
stand
all
over
the
country
like
this
peacocks
trailing
the
graveyards
ay
he
muttered
taking
no
notice
of
me
this
stone
is
cold
i
said
rising
he
got
up
too
and
stretched
his
arms
as
if
he
were
tired
it
was
quite
dark
save
for
the
waxing
moon
which
leaned
over
the
east
it
is
a
very
fine
night
i
said
do
you
notice
a
smell
of
violets
ay
the
moon
looks
like
a
woman
with
child
i
wonder
what
time
got
in
her
belly
you
i
said
you
do
expect
anything
exciting
do
you
exciting
as
exciting
as
this
rotten
old
rot
my
god
like
a
good
house
built
and
finished
and
left
to
tumble
down
again
with
nobody
to
live
in
it
he
laughed
bitterly
saying
come
and
sit
down
he
led
me
off
to
a
seat
by
the
north
door
between
two
pews
very
black
and
silent
there
we
sat
he
putting
his
gun
carefully
beside
him
he
remained
perfectly
still
thinking
whot
up
he
said
at
last
tell
you
i
went
to
father
was
a
big
cattle
died
bankrupt
while
i
was
in
college
and
i
never
took
my
degree
they
persuaded
me
to
be
a
parson
and
a
parson
i
was
i
went
a
curate
to
a
little
place
in
bonnie
place
with
not
many
people
and
a
fine
old
church
and
a
great
rich
parsonage
i
had
overmuch
to
do
and
the
was
the
son
of
an
generous
he
lent
me
a
horse
and
would
have
me
hunt
like
the
rest
i
always
think
of
that
place
with
a
smell
of
honeysuckle
while
the
grass
is
wet
in
the
morning
it
was
fine
and
i
enjoyed
myself
and
did
the
parish
work
all
right
i
believe
i
was
pretty
good
a
cousin
of
the
rector
used
to
come
in
the
hunting
lady
crystabel
lady
in
her
own
right
the
second
year
i
was
there
she
came
in
june
there
was
much
company
so
she
used
to
talk
to
used
to
read
she
used
to
pretend
to
be
so
childish
and
unknowing
and
would
get
me
telling
her
things
and
talking
to
her
and
i
was
hot
on
things
we
must
play
tennis
together
and
ride
together
and
i
must
row
her
down
the
river
she
said
we
were
in
the
wilderness
and
could
do
as
we
liked
she
made
me
wear
flannels
and
soft
clothes
she
was
very
fine
and
frank
and
i
thought
her
all
the
summer
she
stopped
on
i
should
meet
her
in
the
garden
early
in
the
morning
when
i
came
from
a
swim
in
the
was
cleared
and
deepened
on
she
blush
and
make
me
walk
with
her
i
can
remember
i
used
to
stand
and
dry
myself
on
the
bank
full
where
she
might
see
was
mad
on
she
was
madder
on
me
we
went
to
some
caves
in
derbyshire
once
and
she
would
wander
from
the
rest
and
loiter
and
for
a
game
we
played
a
sort
of
hide
and
seek
with
the
party
they
thought
we
gone
and
they
went
and
locked
the
door
then
she
pretended
to
be
frightened
and
clung
to
me
and
said
what
would
they
think
and
hid
her
face
in
my
coat
i
took
her
and
kissed
her
and
we
made
it
up
properly
i
found
out
actually
told
got
the
idea
from
a
sloppy
french
romance
of
a
poor
young
man
i
was
the
poor
young
man
we
got
married
she
gave
me
a
living
she
had
in
her
parsonage
and
we
went
to
live
at
her
hall
she
would
let
me
out
of
her
sight
lord
were
an
infatuated
she
would
choose
to
view
me
in
an
aesthetic
light
i
was
greek
statues
for
her
bless
you
croton
hercules
i
do
know
what
she
had
her
own
way
too
let
her
do
as
she
liked
with
me
then
gradually
she
got
took
her
three
years
to
be
really
glutted
with
me
i
had
a
physique
that
matter
i
have
now
he
held
out
his
arm
to
me
and
bade
me
try
his
muscle
i
was
startled
the
hard
flesh
almost
filled
his
sleeve
ah
he
continued
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
have
the
pride
of
a
body
like
mine
but
she
would
have
she
she
dare
that
was
the
root
of
the
difference
at
first
but
she
cooled
down
and
if
you
do
know
the
pride
of
my
body
you
never
know
my
humiliation
i
tried
to
she
looked
simply
astounded
at
my
cheek
i
never
got
over
that
amazement
she
began
to
get
souly
a
poet
got
hold
of
her
and
she
began
to
affect
was
was
a
lot
like
one
of
his
of
shalott
i
believe
at
any
rate
she
got
souly
and
i
was
her
boeuf
i
put
up
with
that
for
above
a
year
then
i
got
some
servants
clothes
and
went
i
was
seen
in
in
i
never
left
england
i
was
supposed
to
have
died
in
the
bush
she
married
a
young
fellow
then
i
was
proved
to
have
died
and
i
read
a
little
obituary
notice
on
myself
in
a
woman
paper
she
subscribed
to
she
wrote
it
a
warning
to
other
young
ladies
of
position
not
to
be
seduced
by
plausible
poor
young
men
now
she
dead
they
got
the
the
kitchen
down
there
and
it
full
of
photographs
even
an
old
photo
of
an
unfortunate
misalliance
i
feel
somehow
as
if
i
were
at
an
end
too
i
thought
i
grown
a
solid
and
here
i
feel
sore
as
i
did
at
and
i
talk
as
i
used
to
one
have
got
some
children
and
they
of
a
breed
as
you
not
meet
anywhere
i
was
a
good
animal
before
everything
and
i
got
some
children
he
sat
looking
up
where
the
big
moon
swam
through
the
black
branches
of
the
yew
so
she
poor
peacock
i
murmured
he
got
up
looking
always
at
the
sky
and
stretched
himself
again
he
was
an
impressive
figure
massed
in
blackness
against
the
moonlight
with
his
arms
outspread
i
suppose
he
said
it
was
all
her
fault
a
white
peacock
we
will
say
i
suggested
he
laughed
go
home
by
the
top
road
will
you
he
said
i
believe
something
on
in
the
bottom
wood
all
right
i
answered
with
a
quiver
of
apprehension
yes
she
was
fair
enough
he
muttered
ay
said
i
rising
i
held
out
my
hand
from
the
shadow
i
was
startled
myself
by
the
white
sympathy
it
seemed
to
express
extended
towards
him
in
the
moonlight
he
gripped
it
and
cleaved
to
me
for
a
moment
then
he
was
gone
i
went
out
of
the
churchyard
feeling
a
sullen
resentment
against
the
tousled
graves
that
lay
inanimate
across
my
way
the
air
was
heavy
to
breathe
and
fearful
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
trees
i
was
glad
when
i
came
out
on
the
bare
white
road
and
could
see
the
copper
lights
from
the
reflectors
of
a
lamps
and
could
hear
the
amiable
of
the
hoofs
trotting
towards
me
i
was
lonely
when
they
had
passed
over
the
hill
the
big
flushed
face
of
the
moon
poised
just
above
the
treetops
very
majestic
and
far
imminent
i
turned
with
swift
sudden
friendliness
to
the
net
of
spread
over
my
head
dotted
with
soft
clusters
winsomely
i
jumped
up
and
pulled
the
cool
soft
tufts
against
my
face
for
company
and
as
i
passed
still
i
reached
upward
for
the
touch
of
this
budded
gentleness
of
the
trees
the
wood
breathed
fragrantly
with
a
subtle
sympathy
the
firs
softened
their
touch
to
me
and
the
larches
woke
from
the
barren
and
put
out
velvet
fingers
to
caress
me
as
i
passed
only
the
clean
bare
branches
of
the
ash
stood
emblem
of
the
discipline
of
life
i
looked
down
on
the
blackness
where
trees
filled
the
quarry
and
the
valley
bottoms
and
it
seemed
that
the
world
my
own
was
strange
again
some
four
or
five
days
after
annable
had
talked
to
me
in
the
churchyard
i
went
out
to
find
him
again
it
was
sunday
morning
the
was
afloat
with
clear
lyric
green
and
some
primroses
scattered
whitely
on
the
edge
under
the
fringing
boughs
it
was
a
clear
morning
as
when
the
latent
life
of
the
world
begins
to
vibrate
afresh
in
the
air
the
smoke
from
the
cottage
rose
blue
against
the
trees
and
thick
yellow
against
the
sky
the
fire
it
seemed
was
only
just
lighted
and
the
poured
out
sam
appeared
outside
the
house
and
looked
round
then
he
climbed
the
for
a
better
survey
evidently
unsatisfied
paying
slight
attention
to
me
he
jumped
down
and
went
running
across
the
hillside
to
the
wood
he
is
going
for
his
father
i
said
to
myself
and
i
left
the
path
to
follow
him
down
hill
across
the
waste
meadow
crackling
the
blanched
stems
of
last
year
thistles
as
i
went
and
stumbling
in
rabbit
holes
he
reached
the
wall
that
ran
along
the
quarry
edge
and
was
over
it
in
a
twinkling
when
i
came
to
the
place
i
was
somewhat
nonplussed
for
sheer
from
the
stone
fence
the
dropped
for
some
twenty
or
thirty
feet
piled
up
with
unmortared
stones
i
looked
was
a
plain
dark
thread
down
the
hillside
which
marked
a
path
to
this
spot
and
the
wall
was
scored
with
the
marks
of
heavy
boots
then
i
looked
again
down
the
and
i
could
i
have
failed
to
see
projecting
to
make
an
uneven
staircase
such
as
is
often
seen
in
the
derbyshire
fences
i
saw
this
ladder
was
well
used
so
i
trusted
myself
to
it
and
scrambled
down
clinging
to
the
face
of
the
quarry
wall
once
down
i
felt
pleased
with
myself
for
having
discovered
and
used
the
unknown
access
and
i
admired
the
care
and
ingenuity
of
the
keeper
who
had
fitted
and
wedged
the
long
stones
into
the
uncertain
pile
it
was
warm
in
the
quarry
there
the
sunshine
seemed
to
thicken
and
sweeten
there
the
little
mounds
of
overgrown
waste
were
aglow
with
very
early
there
the
sparks
were
coming
out
on
the
bits
of
gorse
and
among
the
stones
the
plumes
were
already
silvery
here
was
spring
sitting
just
awake
unloosening
her
glittering
hair
and
opening
her
purple
eyes
i
went
across
the
quarry
down
to
where
the
brook
ran
murmuring
a
tale
to
the
primroses
and
the
budding
trees
i
was
startled
from
my
wandering
among
the
fresh
things
by
a
faint
clatter
of
stones
what
that
young
rascal
doing
i
said
to
myself
setting
forth
to
see
i
came
towards
the
other
side
of
the
quarry
on
this
the
moister
side
the
bushes
grew
up
against
the
wall
which
was
higher
than
on
the
other
side
though
piled
the
same
with
old
dry
stones
as
i
drew
near
i
could
hear
the
scrape
and
rattle
of
stones
and
the
vigorous
grunting
of
sam
as
he
laboured
among
them
he
was
hidden
by
a
great
bush
of
sallow
catkins
all
yellow
and
murmuring
with
bees
warm
with
spice
when
he
came
in
view
i
laughed
to
see
him
lugging
and
grunting
among
the
great
pile
of
stones
that
had
fallen
in
a
mass
from
the
a
pile
of
stones
and
earth
and
crushed
vegetation
there
was
a
great
bare
gap
in
the
quarry
wall
somehow
the
lad
labouring
earnestness
made
me
anxious
and
i
hurried
up
he
heard
me
and
glancing
round
his
face
red
with
exertion
eyes
big
with
terror
he
called
commanding
me
pull
off
off
suddenly
my
heart
beating
in
my
throat
nearly
suffocated
me
i
saw
the
hand
of
the
keeper
lying
among
the
stones
i
set
to
tearing
away
the
stones
and
we
worked
for
some
time
without
a
word
then
i
seized
the
arm
of
the
keeper
and
tried
to
drag
him
out
but
i
could
not
pull
it
off
whined
the
lad
working
in
a
frenzy
when
we
got
him
out
i
saw
at
once
he
was
dead
and
i
sat
down
trembling
with
exertion
there
was
a
great
smashed
wound
on
the
side
of
the
head
sam
put
his
face
against
his
father
and
snuffed
round
him
like
a
dog
to
feel
the
life
in
him
the
child
looked
at
me
he
wo
get
up
he
said
and
his
little
voice
was
hoarse
with
fear
and
anxiety
i
shook
my
head
then
the
boy
began
to
whimper
he
tried
to
close
the
lips
which
were
drawn
with
pain
and
death
leaving
the
teeth
bare
then
his
fingers
hovered
round
the
eyes
which
were
wide
open
glazed
and
i
could
see
he
was
trembling
to
touch
them
into
life
he
not
asleep
he
said
because
his
eyes
is
i
could
not
bear
the
child
questioning
terror
i
took
him
up
to
carry
him
away
but
he
struggled
and
fought
to
be
free
get
get
up
he
cried
in
a
frenzy
and
i
had
to
let
the
boy
go
he
ran
to
the
dead
man
calling
feyther
feyther
and
pulling
his
shoulder
then
he
sat
down
fascinated
by
the
sight
of
the
wound
he
put
out
his
finger
to
touch
it
and
shivered
come
away
said
i
is
it
that
he
asked
pointing
to
the
wound
i
covered
the
face
with
a
big
silk
handkerchief
now
said
i
he
go
to
sleep
if
you
do
touch
sit
still
while
i
go
and
fetch
somebody
will
run
to
the
hall
he
shook
his
head
i
knew
he
would
not
so
i
told
him
again
not
to
touch
his
father
but
to
let
him
lie
still
till
i
came
back
he
watched
me
go
but
did
not
move
from
his
seat
on
the
stones
beside
the
dead
man
though
i
know
he
was
full
of
terror
at
being
left
alone
i
ran
to
the
dared
not
go
to
the
kennels
in
a
short
time
i
was
back
with
the
squire
and
three
men
as
i
led
the
way
i
saw
the
child
lifting
a
corner
of
the
handkerchief
to
peep
and
see
if
the
eyes
were
closed
in
sleep
then
he
heard
us
and
started
violently
when
we
removed
the
covering
and
he
saw
the
face
unchanged
in
its
horror
he
looked
at
me
with
a
look
i
have
never
forgotten
a
bad
awful
business
repeated
the
squire
a
bad
business
i
said
to
him
from
the
first
that
the
stones
might
come
down
when
he
was
going
up
and
he
said
he
had
taken
care
to
fix
them
but
you
ca
be
sure
you
ca
be
certain
and
he
be
about
half
way
the
whole
wall
would
come
down
on
him
an
awful
business
it
is
really
a
terrible
piece
of
work
they
decided
at
the
inquest
that
the
death
came
by
misadventure
but
there
were
vague
rumours
in
the
village
that
this
was
revenge
which
had
overtaken
the
keeper
they
decided
to
bury
him
in
our
churchyard
at
greymede
under
the
beeches
the
widow
would
have
it
so
and
nothing
might
be
denied
her
in
her
state
it
was
a
magnificent
morning
in
early
spring
when
i
watched
among
the
trees
to
see
the
procession
come
down
the
hillside
the
upper
air
was
woven
with
the
music
of
the
larks
and
my
whole
world
thrilled
with
the
conception
of
summer
the
young
pale
had
arisen
by
the
and
under
the
hazels
when
perchance
the
hot
sun
pushed
his
way
new
little
suns
dawned
and
blazed
with
real
light
there
was
a
certain
thrill
and
quickening
everywhere
as
a
woman
must
feel
when
she
has
conceived
a
sallow
tree
in
a
favoured
spot
looked
like
a
pale
gold
cloud
of
summer
dawn
nearer
it
had
poised
a
golden
fairy
busby
on
every
twig
and
was
voiced
with
a
hum
of
bees
like
any
sacred
golden
bush
uttering
its
gladness
in
the
thrilling
murmur
of
bees
and
in
warm
scent
birds
called
and
flashed
on
every
hand
they
made
off
exultant
with
streaming
strands
of
grass
or
wisps
of
fleece
plunging
into
the
dark
spaces
of
the
wood
and
out
again
into
the
blue
a
lad
moved
across
the
field
from
the
farm
below
with
a
dog
trotting
behind
him
dog
no
a
fussy
lamb
trotting
along
on
its
toes
with
its
tail
swinging
behind
they
were
going
to
the
mothers
on
the
common
who
moved
like
little
grey
clouds
among
the
dark
grose
i
can
not
help
forgetting
and
sharing
the
spink
triumph
when
he
flashes
past
with
a
fleece
from
a
bramble
bush
it
will
cover
the
bedded
moss
it
will
weave
among
the
soft
red
beautifully
it
is
a
prize
it
is
an
ecstasy
to
have
captured
it
at
the
right
moment
and
the
nest
is
nearly
ready
ah
but
the
thrush
is
scornful
ringing
out
his
voice
from
the
hedge
he
sets
his
breast
against
the
mud
and
models
it
warm
for
the
turquoise
blue
bluest
of
eggs
which
cluster
so
close
and
round
against
the
breast
which
round
up
beneath
the
breast
nestling
content
you
should
see
the
bright
ecstasy
in
the
eyes
of
a
nesting
thrush
because
of
the
rounded
caress
of
the
eggs
against
her
breast
what
a
hurry
the
jenny
wren
i
shall
not
see
her
dart
into
the
low
bush
i
have
a
delight
in
watching
them
against
their
shy
little
wills
but
they
have
all
risen
with
a
rush
of
wings
and
are
gone
the
birds
the
air
is
brushed
with
agitation
there
is
no
lark
in
the
sky
not
one
the
heaven
is
clear
of
wings
or
twinkling
till
the
heralds
the
heralds
wave
like
shadows
in
the
bright
air
crying
lamenting
fretting
forever
rising
and
falling
and
circling
round
and
round
the
peewits
cry
and
complain
and
lift
their
broad
wings
in
sorrow
they
stoop
suddenly
to
the
ground
the
lapwings
then
in
another
throb
of
anguish
and
protest
they
swing
up
again
offering
a
glistening
white
breast
to
the
sunlight
to
deny
it
in
black
shadow
then
a
glisten
of
green
and
all
the
time
crying
and
crying
in
despair
the
pheasants
are
frightened
into
cover
they
run
and
dart
through
the
hedge
the
cold
cock
must
fly
in
his
haste
spread
himself
on
his
streaming
plumes
and
sail
into
the
wood
security
there
is
a
cry
in
answer
to
the
peewits
echoing
louder
and
stronger
the
lamentation
of
the
lapwings
a
wail
which
hushes
the
birds
the
men
come
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
slowly
with
the
old
squire
walking
tall
and
straight
in
front
six
bowed
men
bearing
the
coffin
on
their
shoulders
treading
heavily
and
cautiously
under
the
great
weight
of
the
glistening
white
coffin
six
men
following
behind
ill
at
ease
waiting
their
turn
for
the
burden
you
can
see
the
red
handkerchiefs
knotted
round
their
throats
and
their
blue
and
white
between
the
open
waistcoats
the
coffin
is
of
new
unpolished
wood
gleaming
and
glistening
in
the
sunlight
the
men
who
carry
it
remember
all
their
lives
after
the
smell
of
new
warm
again
a
loud
cry
from
the
the
woman
has
followed
thus
far
the
big
shapeless
woman
and
she
cries
with
loud
cries
after
the
white
coffin
as
it
descends
the
hill
and
the
children
that
cling
to
her
skirts
weep
aloud
and
are
not
to
be
hushed
by
the
other
woman
who
bends
over
them
but
does
not
form
one
of
the
group
how
the
crying
frightens
the
birds
and
the
rabbits
and
the
lambs
away
there
run
to
their
mothers
but
the
peewits
are
not
frightened
they
add
their
notes
to
the
sorrow
they
circle
after
the
white
retreating
coffin
they
circle
round
the
woman
it
is
they
who
forever
keen
the
sorrows
of
this
world
they
are
like
priests
in
their
robes
more
black
than
white
more
grief
than
hope
driving
endlessly
round
and
round
turning
lifting
falling
and
crying
always
in
mournful
desolation
repeating
their
last
syllables
like
the
broken
accents
of
despair
the
bearers
have
at
last
sunk
between
the
high
banks
and
turned
out
of
sight
the
big
woman
can
not
see
them
and
yet
she
stands
to
look
she
must
go
home
there
is
nothing
left
they
have
rested
the
coffin
on
the
gate
posts
and
the
bearers
are
wiping
the
sweat
from
their
faces
they
put
their
hands
to
their
shoulders
on
the
place
where
the
weight
has
pressed
the
other
six
are
placing
the
pads
on
their
shoulders
when
a
girl
comes
up
with
a
jug
and
a
blue
pot
the
squire
drinks
first
and
fills
for
the
rest
meanwhile
the
girl
stands
back
under
the
hedge
away
from
the
coffin
which
smells
of
new
in
imagination
she
pictures
the
man
shut
up
there
in
close
darkness
while
the
sunlight
flows
all
outside
and
she
catches
her
breast
with
terror
she
must
turn
and
rustle
among
the
leaves
of
the
violets
for
the
flowers
she
does
not
see
then
trembling
she
comes
to
herself
and
plucks
a
few
flowers
and
breathes
them
hungrily
into
her
soul
for
comfort
the
men
put
down
the
pots
beside
her
with
thanks
and
the
squire
gives
the
word
the
bearers
lift
up
the
burden
again
and
the
rattle
along
the
hollow
white
wood
and
the
pitiful
red
clusters
of
sweep
along
it
as
if
they
whispered
in
we
are
so
sorry
so
always
the
compassionate
buds
in
their
fulness
of
life
bend
down
to
comfort
the
dark
man
shut
up
there
perhaps
the
girl
thinks
he
hears
them
and
goes
softly
to
sleep
she
shakes
the
tears
out
of
her
eyes
on
to
the
ground
and
taking
up
her
pots
goes
slowly
down
over
the
brooks
in
a
while
i
too
got
up
and
went
down
to
the
mill
which
lay
red
and
peaceful
with
the
blue
smoke
rising
as
winsomely
and
carelessly
as
ever
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
i
could
see
a
pair
of
horses
nod
slowly
across
the
fallow
a
man
voice
called
to
them
now
and
again
with
a
resonance
that
filled
me
with
longing
to
follow
my
horses
over
the
fallow
in
the
still
lonely
valley
full
of
sunshine
and
eternal
forgetfulness
the
day
had
already
forgotten
the
water
was
blue
and
white
and
with
shadows
two
swans
sailed
across
the
reflected
trees
with
perfect
blithe
grace
the
gloom
that
had
passed
across
was
gone
i
watched
the
swan
with
his
ruffled
wings
swell
onwards
i
watched
his
slim
consort
go
peeping
into
corners
and
under
bushes
i
saw
him
steer
clear
of
the
bushes
to
keep
full
in
view
turning
his
head
to
me
imperiously
till
i
longed
to
pelt
him
with
the
empty
husks
of
last
year
flowers
and
scabius
i
was
too
indolent
and
i
turned
instead
to
the
orchard
there
the
daffodils
were
lifting
their
heads
and
throwing
back
their
yellow
curls
at
the
foot
of
each
sloping
grey
old
tree
stood
a
family
of
flowers
some
bursten
with
golden
fulness
some
lifting
their
heads
slightly
to
show
a
modest
sweet
countenance
others
still
hiding
their
faces
leaning
forward
pensively
from
the
jaunty
spears
i
wished
i
had
their
language
to
talk
to
them
distinctly
overhead
the
trees
with
lifted
fingers
shook
out
their
hair
to
the
sun
decking
themselves
with
buds
as
white
and
cool
as
a
breasts
i
began
to
be
very
glad
the
discs
glowed
and
laughed
in
a
merry
company
down
the
path
i
stroked
the
velvet
faces
and
laughed
also
and
i
smelled
the
scent
of
leaves
which
is
full
of
childish
memories
the
house
was
quiet
and
complacent
it
was
peopled
with
ghosts
again
but
the
ghosts
had
only
come
to
enjoy
the
warm
place
once
more
carrying
sunshine
in
their
arms
and
scattering
it
through
the
dusk
of
gloomy
rooms
chapter
iii
the
irony
of
inspired
moments
it
happened
the
next
day
after
the
funeral
i
came
upon
reproductions
of
aubrey
beardsley
atalanta
and
of
the
salome
and
others
i
sat
and
looked
and
my
soul
leaped
out
upon
the
new
thing
i
was
bewildered
wondering
grudging
fascinated
i
looked
a
long
time
but
my
mind
or
my
soul
would
come
to
no
state
of
coherence
i
was
fascinated
and
overcome
but
yet
full
of
stubbornness
and
resistance
lettie
was
out
so
although
it
was
even
because
it
was
i
took
the
book
and
went
down
to
the
mill
the
dinner
was
over
there
was
the
fragrance
of
cooked
rhubarb
in
the
room
i
went
straight
to
emily
who
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
put
the
salome
before
her
look
said
i
look
here
she
looked
she
was
and
peered
close
i
was
impatient
for
her
to
speak
she
turned
slowly
at
last
and
looked
at
me
shrinking
with
questioning
well
i
said
is
she
replied
softly
no
is
it
it
makes
you
have
you
brought
it
i
wanted
you
to
see
it
already
i
felt
relieved
seeing
that
she
too
was
caught
in
the
spell
george
came
and
bent
over
my
shoulder
i
could
feel
the
heavy
warmth
of
him
good
lord
he
drawled
half
amused
the
children
came
crowding
to
see
and
emily
closed
the
book
i
shall
be
up
dave
and
she
went
to
wash
her
hands
before
going
to
school
give
it
me
will
you
george
asked
putting
out
his
hand
for
the
book
i
gave
it
him
and
he
sat
down
to
look
at
the
drawings
when
mollie
crept
near
to
look
he
angrily
shouted
to
her
to
get
away
she
pulled
a
mouth
and
got
her
hat
over
her
wild
brown
curls
emily
came
in
ready
for
school
i
she
said
and
she
waited
hesitatingly
i
moved
to
get
my
cap
he
looked
up
with
a
new
expression
in
his
eyes
and
said
are
you
going
a
coming
i
waited
oh
very
said
emily
bitterly
and
she
departed
when
he
had
looked
long
enough
he
got
up
and
we
went
out
he
kept
his
finger
between
the
pages
of
the
book
as
he
carried
it
we
went
towards
the
fallow
land
without
speaking
there
he
sat
down
on
a
bank
leaning
his
back
against
a
and
saying
very
calmly
there
no
need
to
be
in
any
hurry
whereupon
he
proceeded
to
study
the
illustrations
you
know
he
said
at
last
i
do
want
her
i
started
at
the
irrelevance
of
this
remark
and
said
who
lettie
we
got
notice
did
you
know
i
started
to
my
feet
this
time
with
amazement
notice
to
leave
for
rabbits
i
expect
i
wish
she
have
me
cyril
to
leave
strelley
mill
i
repeated
that
i
rather
glad
but
do
you
think
she
might
have
me
cyril
what
a
shame
where
will
you
go
and
you
lie
there
i
do
never
mind
about
the
damned
notice
i
want
her
more
than
the
more
i
look
at
these
naked
lines
the
more
i
want
her
it
a
sort
of
fine
sharp
feeling
like
these
curved
lines
i
know
what
i
do
you
think
she
have
me
has
she
seen
these
pictures
no
if
she
did
perhaps
she
want
mean
she
feel
it
clear
and
sharp
coming
through
her
i
show
her
and
see
i
been
sort
of
thinking
about
father
had
that
notice
it
seemed
as
if
the
ground
was
pulled
from
under
our
feet
i
never
felt
so
lost
then
i
began
to
think
of
her
if
she
have
not
clear
till
you
showed
me
those
pictures
i
must
have
her
if
i
i
must
have
something
it
rather
ghostish
to
have
the
road
suddenly
smudged
out
and
all
the
world
anywhere
nowhere
for
you
to
go
i
must
get
something
sure
soon
or
else
i
feel
as
if
i
should
fall
from
somewhere
and
hurt
myself
i
ask
her
i
looked
at
him
as
he
lay
there
under
the
his
face
all
dreamy
and
boyish
very
unusual
you
ask
lettie
said
i
i
must
ask
her
quick
while
i
feel
as
if
everything
had
gone
and
i
was
ghostish
i
think
i
must
sound
rather
a
lunatic
he
looked
at
me
and
his
eyelids
hung
heavy
over
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
or
as
if
he
were
tired
is
she
at
home
he
said
no
she
gone
to
nottingham
she
be
home
before
dark
i
see
her
then
can
you
smell
violets
i
replied
that
i
could
not
he
was
sure
that
he
could
and
he
seemed
uneasy
till
he
had
justified
the
sensation
so
he
arose
very
leisurely
and
went
along
the
bank
looking
closely
for
the
flowers
i
knew
i
could
white
ones
he
sat
down
and
picked
three
flowers
and
held
them
to
his
nostrils
and
inhaled
their
fragrance
then
he
put
them
to
his
mouth
and
i
saw
his
strong
white
teeth
crush
them
he
chewed
them
for
a
while
without
speaking
then
he
spat
them
out
and
gathered
more
they
remind
me
of
her
too
he
said
and
he
twisted
a
piece
of
honeysuckle
stem
round
the
bunch
and
handed
it
to
me
a
white
violet
is
she
i
smiled
give
them
to
her
and
tell
her
to
come
and
meet
me
just
when
getting
dark
in
the
wood
but
if
she
wo
she
will
if
she
not
at
home
come
and
tell
me
he
lay
down
again
with
his
head
among
the
green
violet
leaves
saying
i
ought
to
work
because
it
all
counts
in
the
valuation
but
i
care
he
lay
looking
at
me
for
some
time
then
he
said
i
do
suppose
i
shall
have
above
twenty
pounds
left
when
we
sold
she
got
plenty
of
money
to
start
she
has
canada
i
could
get
well
she
could
she
sure
she
have
what
she
wanted
he
took
it
all
calmly
as
if
it
were
realised
i
was
somewhat
amused
what
frock
will
she
have
on
when
she
comes
to
meet
me
he
asked
i
do
know
the
same
as
she
gone
to
nottingham
in
i
sort
of
costume
with
a
rather
tight
fitting
coat
why
i
was
thinking
how
she
look
what
chickens
are
you
counting
now
i
asked
but
what
do
you
think
i
look
best
in
he
replied
you
just
as
you
put
that
old
smooth
cloth
coat
all
i
smiled
as
i
told
him
but
he
was
very
serious
sha
i
put
my
new
clothes
on
want
to
leave
your
neck
showing
he
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
and
said
naïvely
do
i
it
amused
him
then
he
lay
looking
dreamily
up
into
the
tree
i
left
him
and
went
wandering
round
the
fields
finding
flowers
and
bird
nests
when
i
came
back
it
was
nearly
four
he
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
he
pulled
out
his
watch
good
lord
he
drawled
i
lain
there
thinking
all
afternoon
i
did
know

do
such
a
thing
where

you
been
it
with
being
all
upset

and
tell
her

myself
i
hope

sha
wake
up
to
the
other

like
i
am
them
why

oh
i
do
i
feel
as
if
i
could
talk
straight
off
without
birds
without
knowing
what
note
is
coming
next
when
i
was
going
he
said

when
i
went

very
delighted
she
could
hardly
wait
to
take
off

round

the
string
of
her

all
the
time

brightness

glitter
of

upon

west

said
mother
oh

such
a
bother
and
she
ran
upstairs
the
sun
was
red
behind
highclose
i
kneeled
in
the
window
seat
and
smiled
at
fate
and
at
people
who
imagine
that
strange
states
are
near
to
the
inner
realities
the
sun
went
straight
down
behind
the
cedar
trees
deliberately
and
it
seemed
as
i
watched
swiftly
lowered
itself
behind
the
trees
behind
the
rim
of
the
hill
i
must
go
i
said
to
myself
and
tell
him
she
will
not
come
yet
i
fidgeted
about
the
room
loth
to
depart
lettie
came
down
dressed
in
low
round
the
neck
she
looked
very
delightful
and
fresh
again
with
a
sparkle
of
the
afternoon
excitement
still
i
put
some
of
these
violets
on
me
she
said
glancing
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
then
taking
the
flowers
from
their
water
she
dried
them
and
fastened
them
among
her
lace
do
lettie
and
i
look
nice
she
said
smiling
glancing
from
me
to
her
reflection
which
was
like
a
light
in
the
dusky
room
that
reminds
me
i
said
george
saxton
wanted
to
see
you
this
evening
what
ever
for
i
do
know
they
got
notice
to
leave
their
farm
and
i
think
he
feels
a
bit
sentimental
oh
he
coming
here
he
said
would
you
go
just
a
little
way
in
the
wood
to
meet
him
did
he
oh

of
course
i
ca
of
course
you
wo
they
his
violets
you
wearing
by
the
way
are
them
stay
it
makes
no
difference
but
whatever
did
he
want
to
see
me
for
i
could
say
i
assure
you
she
glanced
at
herself
in
the
mirror
and
then
at
the
clock
let
see
she
remarked
it
only
a
quarter
to
eight
three
quarters
of
an
but
what
can
he
want
me
for
never
knew
anything
like
it
startling
is
it
i
observed
satirically

glanced
at
herself
in
the
mirror
i

while

and

arranged
it
carefully
over
her
head

went
out
down
the
garden
path
lettie
held
her
skirts
carefully
gathered
from
the
ground
a
nightingale
began
to
sing
in
the
twilight
we
stepped
along
in
silence
as
far
as
the
rhododendron
bushes
now
in
rosy
bud
i
can
not
go
into
the
wood
she
said
come
to
the
top
of
the
riding
we
went
round
the
dark
bushes
george
was
waiting
i
saw
at
once
he
was
half
distrustful
of
himself
now
lettie
dropped
her
skirts
and
trailed
towards
him
he
stood
awkwardly
awaiting
her
conscious
of
the
clownishness
of
his
appearance
she
held
out
her
hand
with
something
of
a
grand
air
see
she
said
i
have
come
thought

looked
at
her
and
suddenly
gained
courage
you
have
been
putting
white

do
look
not
what

nobody
thought
about
it
some
pictures
she
smiled
with
a
gentle
radiance
and
asked
indulgently
and
how
was
i
different

all
that
soft
but
do
i
look
very
nice
with
all
this
soft
stuff

shook
the
silk
away
from
her
smiles

naked
lines

flippant
nights

farmer
you

expect

thought
about
it
and
felt
as
if
i
must
have
you
should
have
you
yes
it
does
do
to
go
on
dreaming
i
think
it
the
first
time

the
last
yes

impossible

made
up
my
mind

so
glad

i
you
yes
said
lettie
it
is
best
but
i
thought
that
she
smiled
at
him
in
sad
reproach
did
you
think
so
he
replied
smiling
gravely
yes
she
whispered
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
he
made
an
impulsive
movement
towards
her
she
however
drew
back
slightly
checking
him
shall
see
you
again
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
we
heard
a
foot
crunching
on
the
gravel
leslie
halted
at
the
top
of
the
riding
lettie
hearing
him
relaxed
into
a
kind
of
feline
graciousness
and
said
to
george
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
going
to
breaks
the
old
life
up
you
said
i
would
see
you
she
left
her
hand
in
his
a
moment
or
two
yes
george
replied
he
turned
away
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
same
drooping
graceful
attitude
watching
him
then
she
turned
round
slowly
she
seemed
hardly
to
notice
leslie
who
was
that
you
were
talking
to
he
asked
he
has
gone
now
she
replied
irrelevantly
as
if
even
then
she
seemed
hardly
to
realise
it
it
appears
to
upset
is
it
he
it
george
saxton
oh
him
yes
what
did
he
want
eh
what
did
he
want
oh
nothing
a
mere
the
interim
eh
said
this
laughing
generously
passing
off
his
annoyance
in
a
jest
i
feel
so
sorry
she
said
what
for
let
us
talk
about
about
something
else
i
bear
to
talk
all
right
he
after
an
awkward
little
pause
what
sort
of
a
time
had
you
in
nottingham
oh
a
fine
time
you
enjoy
yourself
in
the
shops
between
now
some
time
i
go
with
you
and
see
them
very
well
that
sounds
as
if
you
do
want
me
to
go
am
i
already
in
the
way
on
a
shopping
expedition
like
an
old
husband
i
should
think
you
would
be
that
nice
of
you
why
oh
i
do
know
yes
you
do
oh
i
suppose
you
hang
about
i
much
too
well
brought
up
rebecca
has
lighted
the
hall
lamp
yes
it
grown
quite
dark
i
was
here
early
you
never
gave
me
a
good
word
for
it
i
did
notice
there
a
light
in
the
we
go
there
they
went
into
the
she
stood
by
the
piano
and
carefully
took
off
the
wrap
then
she
wandered
listlessly
about
the
room
for
a
minute
are
you
coming
to
sit
down
he
said
pointing
to
the
seat
on
the
couch
beside
him
not
just
now
she
said
trailing
aimlessly
to
the
piano
she
sat
down
and
began
to
play
at
random
from
memory
then
she
did
that
most
irritating
accompaniments
to
songs
with
snatches
of
the
air
where
the
voice
should
have
predominated
i
say
lettie
he
interrupted
after
a
time
yes
she
replied
continuing
to
play
it
not
very
interesting
no
continued
to
play
nor
very
amusing
she
did
not
answer
he
bore
it
for
a
little
time
longer
then
he
said
how
much
longer
is
it
going
to
last
lettie
what
that
sort
of
business
the
piano
stop
playing
if
you
do
like
it
she
did
not
however
cease
all
this
dry
business
i
do
understand
do
you
make
there
she
went
on
tinkling
away
at
if
i
built
a
world
for
you
dear
i
say
stop
it
do
he
cried
she
tinkled
to
the
end
of
the
verse
and
very
slowly
closed
the
piano
come
and
sit
down
he
said
no
i
do
want
rather
have
gone
on
playing
go
on
with
your
damned
playing
then
and
i
go
where
there
more
interest
you
ought
to
like
it
he
did
not
answer
so
she
turned
slowly
round
on
the
stool
opened
the
piano
and
laid
her
fingers
on
the
keys
at
the
sound
of
the
chord
he
started
up
saying
then
i
going
it
very
she
said
through
the
calm
jingle
of
meine
ruh
is
he
stood
biting
his
lips
then
he
made
one
more
appeal
lettie
yes
are
you
going
to
leave
amiable
you
are
a
jolly
torment
what
upset
you
now
nay
it
not
i
who
am
upset
i
glad
to
hear
do
you
call
yourself
i
oh
well
i
going
then
must
you
early
he
did
not
go
and
she
played
more
and
more
softly
languidly
aimlessly
once
she
lifted
her
head
to
speak
but
did
not
say
anything
look
here
he
ejaculated
all
at
once
so
that
she
started
and
jarred
the
piano
what
do
you
mean
by
it
she
jingled
leisurely
a
few
seconds
before
answering
then
she
replied
what
a
worry
you
are
i
suppose
you
want
me
out
of
the
way
while
you
sentimentalise
over
that
milkman
you
need
bother
you
can
do
it
while
i
here
or
i
go
and
leave
you
in
peace
i
go
and
call
him
back
for
you
if
you
that
what
you
she
turned
on
the
piano
stool
slowly
and
looked
at
him
smiling
faintly
it
is
very
good
of
you
she
said
he
clenched
his
fists
and
grinned
with
rage
you
tantalising
he
began
lifting
his
fists
expressively
she
smiled
then
he
swung
round
knocked
several
hats
flying
off
the
stand
in
the
hall
slammed
the
door
and
was
gone
lettie
continued
to
play
for
some
time
after
which
she
went
up
to
her
own
room
leslie
did
not
return
to
us
the
next
day
nor
the
day
after
the
first
day
marie
came
and
told
us
he
had
gone
away
to
yorkshire
to
see
about
the
new
mines
that
were
being
sunk
there
and
was
likely
to
be
absent
for
a
week
or
so
these
business
visits
to
the
north
were
rather
frequent
the
firm
of
which
tempest
was
director
and
chief
shareholder
were
opening
important
new
mines
in
the
other
county
as
the
seams
at
home
were
becoming
exhausted
or
unprofitable
it
was
proposed
that
leslie
should
live
in
yorkshire
when
he
was
married
to
superintend
the
new
workings
he
at
first
rejected
the
idea
but
he
seemed
later
to
approve
of
it
more
during
the
time
he
was
away
lettie
was
moody
and
she
did
not
mention
george
nor
the
mill
indeed
she
preserved
her
best
most
haughty
and
ladylike
manner
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
of
leslie
absence
we
were
out
in
the
garden
the
trees
were
uttering
joyous
leaves
my
mother
was
in
the
midst
of
her
garden
lifting
the
dusky
faces
of
the
auriculas
to
look
at
the
velvet
lips
or
tenderly
taking
a
young
weed
from
the
black
soil
the
thrushes
were
calling
and
clamouring
all
round
the
japonica
flamed
on
the
wall
as
the
light
grew
thicker
the
tassels
of
white
swung
gently
in
the
breeze
what
shall
i
do
mother
said
lettie
as
she
wandered
across
the
grass
to
pick
at
the
japonica
flowers
what
shall
i
do
nothing
to
do
well
my
do
you
want
to
do
you
have
been
moping
about
all
and
see
somebody
it
such
a
long
way
to
eberwich
is
it
then
go
somewhere
nearer
lettie
fretted
about
with
restless
petulant
indecision
i
do
know
what
to
do
she
said
and
i
feel
as
if
i
might
just
as
well
never
have
lived
at
all
as
waste
days
like
this
i
wish
we
buried
in
this
dead
little
wish
we
were
near
the
hateful
having
to
depend
on
about
two
or
three
folk
for
pleasure
in
life
i
ca
help
it
my
must
do
something
for
yourself
and
what
can
i
do
can
do
nothing
then
i
go
to
bed
that
i
the
dead
weight
of
a
wasted
day
on
me
i
feel
as
if
i
do
something
desperate
very
well
then
said
mother
do
it
and
have
done
oh
it
no
good
talking
to
do
she
turned
away
went
to
the
laurestinus
and
began
pulling
off
it
the
long
red
berries
i
expected
she
would
fret
the
evening
wastefully
away
i
noticed
all
at
once
that
she
stood
still
it
was
the
noise
of
a
running
rapidly
down
the
hill
towards
light
sound
i
listened
also
i
could
feel
the
swinging
drop
of
the
car
as
it
came
down
the
leaps
of
the
hill
we
could
see
the
dust
trail
up
among
the
trees
lettie
raised
her
head
and
listened
expectantly
the
car
rushed
along
the
edge
of
there
was
the
jar
of
brakes
as
the
machine
slowed
down
and
stopped
in
a
moment
with
a
quick
flutter
of
sound
it
was
passing
the
and
whirling
up
the
drive
through
the
wood
to
us
lettie
stood
with
flushed
cheeks
and
brightened
eyes
she
went
towards
the
bushes
that
shut
off
the
lawn
from
the
gravelled
space
in
front
of
the
house
watching
a
car
came
racing
through
the
trees
it
was
the
small
car
leslie
used
on
the
firm
it
was
white
with
dust
leslie
suddenly
put
on
the
brakes
and
tore
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
house
he
stepped
to
the
ground
there
he
staggered
a
little
being
giddy
and
cramped
with
the
long
drive
his
and
cap
were
thick
with
dust
lettie
called
to
him
leslie
flew
down
to
him
he
took
her
into
his
arms
and
clouds
of
dust
rose
round
her
he
kissed
her
and
they
stood
perfectly
still
for
a
moment
she
looked
up
into
his
she
disengaged
her
arms
to
take
off
his
disfiguring
after
she
had
looked
at
him
a
moment
tenderly
she
kissed
him
again
he
loosened
his
hold
of
her
and
she
said
in
a
voice
full
of
tenderness
you
are
trembling
dear
it
the
ride
i
never
stopped
without
further
words
she
took
him
into
the
house
how
pale
you
lie
on
the
mind
the
dust
all
right
i
find
you
a
coat
of
cyril
o
mother
he
come
all
those
miles
in
the
car
without
him
lie
down
she
ran
and
brought
him
a
jacket
and
put
the
cushions
round
and
made
him
lie
on
the
couch
then
she
took
off
his
boots
and
put
slippers
on
his
feet
he
lay
watching
her
all
the
time
he
was
white
with
fatigue
and
excitement
i
wonder
if
i
shall
be
had
up
for
can
feel
the
road
coming
at
me
yet
he
said
why
were
you
so
headlong
i
felt
as
if
i
should
go
wild
if
i
did
i
did
rush
i
did
know
how
you
might
have
taken
me
lettie
when
i
i
did
she
smiled
gently
at
him
and
he
lay
resting
recovering
looking
at
her
it
a
wonder
i
have
done
something
been
half
mad
since
i
lettie
i
was
a
damned
fool
and
a
could
have
torn
myself
in
two
i
done
nothing
but
curse
and
rage
at
myself
ever
since
i
feel
as
if
i
just
come
up
out
of
hell
you
do
know
how
thankful
i
am
lettie
that
you
against
me
for
what
i
said
she
went
to
him
and
sat
down
by
him
smoothing
his
hair
from
his
forehead
kissing
him
her
attitude
tender
suggesting
tears
her
movements
impulsive
as
if
with
a
she
would
not
acknowledge
but
which
she
must
silence
with
lavish
tenderness
he
drew
her
to
him
and
they
remained
quiet
for
some
time
till
it
grew
dark
the
noise
of
my
mother
stirring
in
the
next
room
disturbed
them
lettie
rose
and
he
also
got
up
from
the
couch
i
suppose
he
said
i
shall
have
to
go
home
and
get
bathed
and
he
added
in
tones
which
made
it
clear
he
did
not
want
to
go
i
shall
have
to
get
back
in
the
do
know
what
they
say
at
any
rate
she
said
you
could
wash
but
i
must
get
out
of
these
i
want
a
bath
you
might
have
some
of
cyril

water
hot
i
know

all
events

no
idea

me
till
next
monday
or
perhaps
you
could
stay
they
need
know
they
looked
at
each
other
with
wide
smiling
children
on
the
brink
of
a
stolen
pleasure
oh
but
what
would
your
mother
think
i
go
she
wo
mind
a
bit
oh
i
ask
her
he
wanted
to
stay
far
more
than
she
wished
it
so
it
was
she
who
put
down
his
opposition
and
triumphed
my
mother
lifted
her
eyebrows
and
said
very
quietly
he
better
go
be
straight
but
look
how
he
have
to
tell
them
and
how
would
he
feel
it
really
my
fault
in
the
end
do
be
piggling
and
mean
and
grundyish
matouchka
it
is
neither
meanness
nor
oh
ydgrun
exclaimed
lettie
ironically
he
may
certainly
stay
if
he
likes
said
mother
slightly
nettled
at
lettie
gibe
all
right
be
a
sweetling
do
lettie
went
out
a
little
impatient
at
my
mother
unwillingness
but
leslie
stayed
nevertheless
in
a
few
moments
lettie
was
up
in
the
spare
bedroom
arranging
and
adorning
and
rebecca
was
running
with
bottles
and
hurrying
down
with
clean
lettie
hastily
appropriated
my
best
she
had
given
took
the
suit
of
pajamas
of
the
thinnest
finest
discovered
a
new
made
selections
from
my
shirts
and
handkerchiefs
and
directed
me
which
suit
to
lend
him
altogether
i
was
astonished
and
perhaps
a
trifle
annoyed
at
her
extraordinary
thoughtfulness
and
solicitude
he
came
down
to
supper
bathed
brushed
and
radiant
he
ate
heartily
and
seemed
to
emanate
a
warmth
of
physical
comfort
and
pleasure
the
colour
was
flushed
again
into
his
face
and
he
carried
his
body
with
the
old
independent
assertive
air
i
have
never
known
the
time
when
he
looked
handsomer
when
he
was
more
attractive
there
was
a
certain
warmth
about
him
a
certain
glow
that
enhanced
his
words
his
laughter
his
movements
he
was
the
predominant
person
and
we
felt
a
pleasure
in
his
mere
proximity
my
mother
however
could
not
quite
get
rid
of
her
stiffness
and
soon
after
supper
she
rose
saying
she
would
finish
her
letter
in
the
next
room
bidding
him
as
she
would
probably
not
see
him
again
the
cloud
of
this
little
coolness
was
the
thinnest
and
most
transitory
he
talked
and
laughed
more
gaily
than
ever
and
was
ostentatious
in
his
movements
throwing
back
his
head
taking
little
attitudes
which
displayed
the
broad
firmness
of
his
breast
the
grace
of
his
physique
i
left
them
at
the
piano
he
was
sitting
pretending
to
play
and
looking
up
all
the
while
at
her
who
stood
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
in
the
morning
he
was
up
early
by
six
downstairs
and
attending
to
the
car
when
i
got
down
i
found
him
very
busy
and
very
quiet
i
know
i
a
beastly
nuisance
he
said
but
i
must
get
off
early
rebecca
came
and
prepared
breakfast
which
we
two
ate
alone
he
was
remarkably
dull
and
wordless
it
a
wonder
lettie
has
got
up
to
have
breakfast
with
such
a
one
for
raving
about
the
perfection
of
the
early
purity
and
promises
and
so
forth
i
said
he
broke
his
bread
nervously
and
drank
some
coffee
as
if
he
were
agitated
making
noises
in
his
throat
as
he
swallowed
it
too
early
for
her
i
should
think
he
replied
wiping
his
moustache
hurriedly
yet
he
seemed
to
listen
for
her
lettie
bedroom
was
over
the
study
where
rebecca
had
laid
breakfast
and
he
listened
now
and
again
holding
his
knife
and
fork
suspended
in
their
action
then
he
went
on
with
his
meal
again
when
he
was
laying
down
his
serviette
the
door
opened
he
pulled
himself
together
and
turned
round
sharply
it
was
mother
when
she
spoke
to
him
his
face
twitched
with
a
little
frown
half
of
relief
half
of
disappointment
i
must
be
going
now
he
thank
you
very
you
are
a
boy
i
wonder
why
lettie
does
come
down
i
know
she
is
up
yes
he
replied
yes
i
heard
her
perhaps
she
is
dressing
i
must
get
off
i
call
her
bother
come
if
she
but
mother
had
called
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
lettie
going
all
right
said
lettie
and
in
another
minute
she
came
downstairs
she
was
dressed
in
dark
severe
stuff
and
she
was
somewhat
pale
she
did
not
look
at
any
of
us
but
turned
her
eyes
aside
she
said
to
him
offering
him
her
cheek
he
kissed
her
murmuring
love
he
stood
in
the
doorway
a
moment
looking
at
her
with
beseeching
eyes
she
kept
her
face
half
averted
and
would
not
look
at
him
but
stood
pale
and
cold
biting
her
underlip
he
turned
sharply
away
with
a
motion
of
keen
disappointment
set
the
engines
of
the
car
into
action
mounted
and
drove
quickly
away
lettie
stood
pale
and
inscrutable
for
some
moments
then
she
went
in
to
breakfast
and
sat
toying
with
her
food
keeping
her
head
bent
down
her
face
hidden
in
less
than
an
hour
he
was
back
again
saying
he
had
left
something
behind
he
ran
upstairs
and
then
hesitating
went
into
the
room
where
lettie
was
still
sitting
at
table
i
had
to
come
back
he
said
she
lifted
her
face
towards
him
but
kept
her
eyes
averted
looking
out
of
the
window
she
was
flushed
what
had
you
forgotten
she
asked
i
left
my
cigarette
case
he
replied
there
was
an
awkward
silence
but
i
shall
have
to
be
getting
off
he
added
yes
i
suppose
you
will
she
replied
after
another
pause
he
asked
wo
you
just
walk
down
the
path
with
me
she
rose
without
answering
he
took
a
shawl
and
put
it
round
her
carefully
she
merely
allowed
him
they
walked
in
silence
down
the
garden
you
angry
with
me
he
faltered
tears
suddenly
came
to
her
eyes
what
did
you
come
back
for
she
said
averting
her
face
from
him
he
looked
at
her
i
knew
you
were
he
hesitated
why
did
you
go
away
she
said
impulsively
he
hung
his
head
and
was
silent
i
do
see
it
should
make
trouble
between
us
lettie
he
faltered
she
made
a
swift
gesture
of
repulsion
whereupon
catching
sight
of
her
hand
she
hid
it
swiftly
against
her
skirt
again
you
make
my
very
hands
disclaim
me
she
struggled
to
say
he
looked
at
her
clenched
fist
pressed
against
the
folds
of
her
dress
he
began
much
troubled
i
tell
you
i
ca
bear
the
sight
of
my
own
hands
she
said
in
low
passionate
tones
but
surely
lettie
there
no
you
love
she
seemed
to
wince
he
waited
puzzled
and
miserable
and
we
going
to
be
married
are
we
he
resumed
looking
pleadingly
at
her
she
stirred
and
exclaimed
oh
why
do
you
go
away
what
did
you
come
back
for
you
kiss
me
before
i
go
he
asked
she
stood
with
averted
face
and
did
not
reply
his
forehead
was
twitching
in
a
puzzled
frown
lettie
he
said
she
did
not
move
or
answer
but
remained
with
her
face
turned
full
away
so
that
he
could
see
only
the
contour
of
her
cheek
after
waiting
awhile
he
flushed
turned
swiftly
and
set
his
machine
rattling
in
a
moment
he
was
racing
between
the
trees
chapter
iv
kiss
when
she
ripe
for
tears
it
was
the
sunday
after
leslie
visit
we
had
had
a
wretched
week
with
everybody
mute
and
unhappy
though
spring
had
come
none
of
us
saw
it
afterwards
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
seen
all
the
ranks
of
poplars
suddenly
bursten
into
a
dark
crimson
glow
with
a
flutter
of
where
the
sun
came
through
the
leaves
that
i
had
found
high
cradles
where
the
swan
eggs
lay
by
the
waterside
that
i
had
seen
the
daffodils
leaning
from
the
wooden
walls
of
the
and
all
moss
daffodils
water
scattered
with
the
pink
scarves
from
the
elm
buds
that
i
had
broken
the
fans
of
the
sycamore
and
had
watched
the
white
cloud
of
go
silver
grey
against
the
evening
sky
but
i
had
not
perceived
it
and
i
had
not
any
vivid
left
from
the
neglected
week
it
was
sunday
evening
just
after
tea
when
lettie
suddenly
said
to
me
come
with
me
down
to
strelley
mill
i
was
astonished
but
i
obeyed
unquestioningly
on
the
threshold
we
heard
a
chattering
of
girls
and
immediately
alice
voice
greeted
us

somewhat
testily

wailed
alice
emily
frowned
and
bit
her
finger
come
on
georgie

like
the
finger
of
a
pair
two
weights
which
draw
the
heavier
he
replied
smiling
and
looking
neither
at
meg
or
lettie
then
it
meg
cried
alice
oh
i
wish
i
was
no
chance
with
syb
against
pem
emily
flashed
looks
of
rage
meg
blushed
and
felt
ashamed
lettie
began
to
recover
from
her
first
outraged
indignation
and
smiled
thus
we
went
a
walk
in
two
trios
unfortunately
as
the
evening
was
so
fine
the
roads
were
full
of
strollers
groups
of
three
or
four
men
dressed
in
pale
trousers
and
shiny
black
cloth
coats
following
their
suspicious
little
dogs
gangs
of
youths
slouching
along
occupied
with
nothing
often
silent
talking
now
and
then
in
raucous
tones
on
some
subject
of
brief
interest
then
the
gallant
husbands
in
their
tail
coats
very
husbandly
pushing
a
jingling
perambulator
admonished
by
a
much
dressed
spouse
round
whom
the
small
members
of
the
family
gyrated
occasionally
two
lovers
walking
with
a
space
between
them
disowning
each
other
occasionally
a
smartly
dressed
mother
with
two
little
girls
in
white
silk
frocks
and
much
expanse
of
yellow
hair
stepping
mincingly
and
near
by
a
father
awkwardly
controlling
his
sunday
suit
to
endure
all
this
it
was
necessary
to
chatter
unconcernedly
george
had
to
keep
up
the
conversation
behind
and
he
seemed
to
do
it
with
ease
discoursing
on
the
lambs
discussing
the
meg
exclaimed
oh
are
they
black
they
might
ha
crept
down
th
chimney
i
never
saw
any
like
them
before
he
described
how
he
had
reared
two
on
the
bottle
exciting
meg
keen
admiration
by
his
mothering
of
the
lambs
then
he
went
on
to
the
peewits
harping
on
the
same
string
how
they
would
cry
and
pretend
to
be
just
fancy
though
how
he
had
moved
the
eggs
of
one
pair
while
he
was
ploughing
and
the
mother
had
followed
them
and
had
even
sat
watching
as
he
drew
near
again
with
the
plough
watching
him
come
and
well
she
knew
they
know
those
who
are
kind
to
yes
he
agreed
her
little
bright
eyes
seem
to
speak
as
you
go
by
oh
i
do
think
they
nice
little
you
lettie
cried
meg
in
access
of
tenderness
lettie
brevity
we
walked
over
the
hills
and
down
into
greymede
meg
thought
she
ought
to
go
home
to
her
grandmother
and
george
bade
her
go
saying
he
would
call
and
see
her
in
an
hour
or
so
the
dear
girl
was
disappointed
but
she
went
unmurmuring
we
left
alice
with
a
friend
and
hurried
home
through
selsby
to
escape
the
parade
as
you
walk
home
past
selsby
the
pit
stands
up
against
the
west
with
beautiful
tapering
chimneys
marked
in
black
against
the
swim
of
sunset
and
the
etched
with
tall
significance
on
the
brightness
then
the
houses
are
squat
in
rows
of
shadow
at
the
foot
of
these
high
monuments
do
you
know
cyril
said
emily
i
meant
to
go
and
see
mrs
keeper
moved
into
bonsart
row
and
the
children
come
to
it
awful
never
been
to
school
and
they
are
unspeakable
what
she
gone
there
for
i
asked
i
suppose
the
squire
wanted
the
she
chose
it
herself
but
the
way
they
fearful
to
think
of

why

emily
stumbled
you
did
want
and
you
dare
perhaps

she
replied
sharply
come
on
then
we
go
through
the
twitchel
let
me
tell
lettie
lettie
at
once
declared
no
some
asperity
all
right
said
george
i

you
home
but
this
suited
lettie
still
less
i
do
know
what

to
go
for

she
said
and
sunday

and
everybody
everywhere
i
want
to

with
you
ha
cried
the
latter
you
think
i
wo
go
to
see
her
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
george
pulled
his
moustache
well
i
do
care
declared
lettie
and
we
marched
down
the
twitchel
indian
file
we
came
near
to
the
ugly
rows
of
houses
that
back
up
against
the
everywhere
is
black
and
sooty
the
houses
are
back
to
back
having
only
one
entrance
which
is
from
a
square
garden
where
weeds
grow
sulkily
and
which
looks
on
to
a
row
of
evil
little
huts
the
road
everywhere
is
trodden
over
with
a
crust
of
soot
and
and
cinders
between
the
rows
however
was
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
bare
heads
bare
arms
white
aprons
and
black
sunday
frocks
bristling
with
gimp
one
or
two
men
squatted
on
their
heels
with
their
backs
against
a
wall
laughing
the
women
were
waving
their
arms
and
screaming
up
at
the
roof
of
the
end
house
emily
and
lettie
drew
back
look
that
little
beggar
sam
said
george
there
sure
enough
perched
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
against
the
end
chimney
was
the
young
imp
coatless
his
torn
away
from
the
cuffs
i
knew
his
bright
reddish
young
head
in
a
moment
he
got
up
his
bare
toes
clinging
to
the
tiles
and
spread
out
his
fingers
fanwise
from
his
nose
shouting
something
which
immediately
caused
the
crowd
to
toss
with
indignation
and
the
women
to
shriek
again
sam
sat
down
suddenly
having
almost
lost
his
balance
the
village
constable
hurried
up
his
thin
neck
stretching
out
of
his
tunic
and
demanded
the
cause
of
the
hubbub
immediately
a
woman
with
bright
brown
squinting
eyes
and
a
birthmark
on
her
cheek
rushed
forward
and
seized
the
policeman
by
the
sleeve
up
up
an
birch
till
bloody
back
raw
she
screamed
the
thin
policeman
shook
her
off
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
matter
i
smosh
like
a
rotten
tater
cried
the
woman
if
i
can
lay
on
not
fit
ter
live
nowhere
where

seeing

at

distorted
his
honest
features
and
overheated
her
wrath
till
lettie
and
emily
trembled
with
dismay
the
mother
head
appeared
at
the
bedroom
window
she
slid
the
sash
back
and
craned
out
vainly
trying
to
look
over
the
gutter
below
the
slates
she
was
even
more
dishevelled
than
usual
and
the
tears
had
dried
on
her
pale
face
she
stretched
further
out
clinging
to
the
window
frame
and
to
the
gutter
overhead
till
i
was
afraid
she
would
come
down
with
a
crash
the
men
squatting
on
their
heels
against
the
wall
of
the
ashpit
laughed
saying
nab
ter
see
and
then
the
pitiful
voice
of
the
woman
was
heard
crying

looked
at
the
crowd
and
at
the
eaves
from
under
which
rose
his
mother
voice
he
was
going
to
cry
a
big
gaunt
woman
with
the
family
steel
comb
stuck
in
her
back
hair
shouted
tha

and
aided
by
the
woman
with
the
birthmark
and
the
squint
she
reviled
him
the
little
scoundrel
in
a
burst
of
defiance
picked
a
piece
of
mortar
from
between
the
slates
and
in
a
second
it
flew
into
fragments
against
the
family
steel
comb
the
wearer
thereof
declared
her
head
was
laid
open
and
there
was
general
confusion
the
do
know
how
thin
he
must
have
been
when
he
was
taken
out
of
his
his
head
and
he
too
began
brandishing
his
fists
spitting
from
under
his
moustache
as
he
commanded
in
tones
of
authority
now
then
no
more
on
thee
down
here
an
no
more
about
the
boy
tried
to
creep
over
the
ridge
of
the
roof
and
escape
down
the
other
side
immediately
the
brats
rushed
round
yelling
to
the
other
side
of
the
row
and
pieces
of
gravel
began
to
fly
over
the
roof
sam
crouched
against
the
chimney
got
yelled
one
little
devil
got
again
a
shower
of
stones
came
down
scattering
the
women
and
the
policeman
the
mother
rushed
from
the
house
and
made
a
wild
onslaught
on
the
throwers
she
caught
one
and
flung
him
down
immediately
the
rest
turned
and
aimed
their
missiles
at
her
then
george
and
the
policeman
and
i
dashed
after
the
young
wretches
and
the
women
ran
to
see
what
happened
to
their
offspring
we
caught
two
lads
of
fourteen
or
so
and
made
the
policeman
haul
them
after
us
the
rest
fled
when
we
returned
to
the
field
of
battle
sam
had
gone
too
if
slived
off
cried
the
woman
with
a
squint
but
i
see
him
locked
up
for
this
at
this
moment
a
band
of
missioners
from
one
of
the
chapels
or
churches
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
row
and
the
little
harmonium
began
to
bray
and
the
place
vibrated
with
the
sound
of
a
woman
powerful
voice
propped
round
by
several
others
singing
at
even
the
sun
was
everybody
hurried
towards
the
new
noise
save
the
policeman
with
his
captives
the
woman
with
the
squint
and
the
woman
with
the
family
comb
i
told
the
limb
of
the
law
he
better
get
rid
of
the
two
boys
and
find
out
what
mischief
the
others
were
after
then
i
enquired
of
the
woman
with
the
squint
what
was
the
matter
young
uns
we
from
that
doe
an
there
no
many
more
if
they
an
she
replied
lapsing
now
her
fury
was
spent
into
sullen
resentment
an
niver
a
word
should
we
a
known
added
the
but
for
that
blessed
cat
of
ourn
as
scrat
it
up

said
i
the
rabbit
no
there
were
nowt
left
but
th
seen
ter
that
a
thieving
lot
when
was
that
said
i
this
mortal
there
was
th
head
an
th
back
in
th
dirty
can
show
you
this
got
in
our
pantry
for
a
proof
i
martha
a
fat
lot
o
good
it
i
rip
th
neck
out
of
if
ever
i
lay
on
at
last
i
made
out
that
samuel
had
stolen
a
large
doe
out
of
a
bunch
in
the
of
the
lady
had
skinned
it
buried
the
skin
and
offered
his
booty
to
his
mother
as
a
wild
rabbit
trapped
the
doe
had
been
the
chief
item
of
the
annables
sunday
a
portion
was
unluckily
saved
till
monday
providing
undeniable
proof
of
the
theft
the
owner
of
the
rabbit
had
supposed
the
creature
to
have
escaped
this
peaceful
supposition
had
been
destroyed
by
the
seeing
her
cat
scratching
in
the
annables
garden
unearth
the
white
and
brown
after
which
the
trouble
had
begun
the
woman
was
not
so
hard
to
manage
i
talked
to
her
as
if
she
were
some
male
friend
of
mine
only
appealing
to
her
womanliness
with
all
the
soft
sadness
i
could
press
into
the
tones
of
my
voice
in
the
end
she
was
mollified
and
even
tender
and
motherly
in
her
feelings
toward
the
unfortunate
family
i
left
on
her
dresser
the
i
shrank
from
offering
her
and
having
reduced
the
also
i
marched
off
carrying
the
stewpot
and
the
fragments
of
the
doe
to
the
cottage
of
the
widow
where
george
and
the
girls
awaited
me
the
house
was
in
a
woeful
state
in
the
rocking
chair
beside
the
high
guard
that
surrounded
the
hearth
sat
the
mother
rocking
looking
sadly
shaken
now
her
excitement
was
over
lettie
was
nursing
the
little
baby
and
emily
the
next
child
george
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
trying
to
look
natural
the
little
kitchen
was
was
no

not
even
a
place
on
the
table
for
the
so
i
gathered
together
cups
and
mugs
containing
tea
sops
and
set
down
the
vessel
of
ignominy
on
the
much
slopped
the
four
little
children
were
striped
and
patched
with
my
entrance
one
under
the
table
recommenced
to
weep
so
i
gave
him
my
pencil
which
pushed
in
and
out
but
which
pushes
in
and
out
no
more
the
sight
of
the
stewpot
affected
the
mother
afresh
she
wept
again
crying
an
i
niver

a
snared

after
a
while
we
left
promising
to
go
again
and
to
see
after
the
safety
of
sam
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
houses
we
could
hear
the
throb
of
the
engines
and
the
soft
whirr
of
the
fan
is
it
cruel
said
emily
plaintively
was
the
man
a
wretch
to
marry
the
woman
like
that
added
lettie
with
decision
speak
of
lady
chrystabel
said
i
and
then
there
was
silence
i
suppose
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
any
more
than
the
rest
of
us
i
thought
you
were
going
to
your
the
ram
inn
said
lettie
to
george
when
they
came
to
the
not
too
late
he
answered
quietly
you
will
come
round
our
way
wo
you
yes
she
said
we
were
eating
bread
and
milk
at
the
farm
and
the
father
was
talking
with
vague
sadness
and
reminiscence
lingering
over
the
thought
of
their
departure
from
the
old
house
he
was
a
pure
romanticist
forever
seeking
the
colour
of
the
past
in
the
present
monotony
he
seemed
settling
down
to
an
easy
contented
when
the
unrest
on
the
farm
and
development
of
his
children
quickened
him
with
fresh
activity
he
read
books
on
the
land
question
and
modern
novels
in
the
end
he
became
an
advanced
radical
almost
a
socialist
occasionally
his
letters
appeared
in
the
newspapers
he
had
taken
a
new
hold
on
life
over
supper
he
became
enthusiastic
about
canada
and
to
watch
him
his
ruddy
face
lighted
up
his
burly
form
straight
and
nerved
with
excitement
was
to
admire
him
to
hear
him
his
words
of
thoughtful
all
warm
with
a
young
man
hopes
was
to
love
him
at
he
was
more
spontaneous
and
enthusiastic
than
george
and
far
more
happy
and
hopeful
emily
would
not
agree
to
go
away
with
should
she
do
in
canada
she
she
did
not
want
the
little
ones
to
be
drudges
on
a
the
end
to
be
nothing
but
cattle
nay
said
her
father
gently
mollie
shall
learn
the
dairying
and
david
will
just
be
right
to
take
to
the
place
when
i
give
up
perhaps
be
a
bit
rough
and
hard
at
first
but
when
we
got
over
it
we
shall
think
it
was
one
of
the
best
you
do
and
you
george
asked
lettie
i
not
going
what
should
i
go
for
there
nothing
at
the
end
of
it
only
a
long
life
it
like
a
day
here
in
long
work
day
pleasant
enough
and
when
it
done
you
sleep
it
work
and
sleep
and
comfort
a
life
it
not
enough
what
the
odds
might
as
well
be
flower
the
mare
his
father
looked
at
him
gravely
and
thoughtfully
now
it
seems
to
me
so
different
he
said
sadly
it
seems
to
me
you
can
live
your
own
life
and
be
independent
and
think
as
you
like
without
being
choked
with
harassments
i
feel
as
if
i
could
keep
i
going
to
get
more
out
of
my
life
i
hope
laughed
george
no
do
you
know
and
here
he
turned
straight
to
lettie
do
you
know
going
to
get
pretty
rich
so
that
i
can
do
what
i
want
for
a
bit
i
want
to
see
what
it
like
to
taste
all
taste
the
towns
i
want
to
know
what
i
got
in
me
i
get
at
least
i
have
a
good
try
and
pray
how
will
you
manage
it
asked
emily
i
begin
by
then
you
see
emily
laughed
with
let
us
see
you
begin
ah
you
not
wise
said
the
father
laughing
he
said
to
lettie
in
coaxing
confidential
tones
but
he
come
out
there
to
me
in
a
year
or
see
if
he
does
i
wish
i
could
come
now
said
i
if
you
would
said
george
i
go
with
you
but
not
by
myself
to
become
a
fat
stupid
fool
like
my
own
cattle
while
he
was
speaking
gyp
burst
into
a
rage
of
barking
the
father
got
up
to
see
what
it
was
and
george
followed
trip
the
great
rushed
out
of
the
house
shaking
the
buildings
with
his
roars
we
saw
the
white
dog
flash
down
the
yard
we
heard
a
rattle
from
the
ladder
and
in
a
moment
a
scream
from
the
orchard
side
we
rushed
forward
and
there
on
the
sharp
lay
a
little
figure
face
down
and
trip
standing
over
it
looking
rather
puzzled
i
picked
up
the
was
sam
he
struggled
as
soon
as
he
felt
my
hands
but
i
bore
him
off
to
the
house
he
wriggled
like
a
wild
hare
and
kicked
but
at
last
he
was
still
i
set
him
on
the
hearthrug
to
examine
him
he
was
a
quaint
little
figure
dressed
in
a
man
trousers
that
had
been
botched
small
for
him
and
a
coat
hanging
in
rags
did
he
get
hold
of
you
asked
the
father
where
was
it
he
got
hold
of
you
but
the
child
stood
unanswering
his
little
pale
lips
pinched
together
his
eyes
staring
out
at
nothing
emily
went
on
her
knees
before
him
and
put
her
face
close
to
his
saying
with
a
voice
that
made
one
shrink
from
its
unbridled
emotion
of
caress
did
he
hurt
you
eh
us
where
he
hurt
you
she
would
have
put
her
arms
around
him
but
he
shrank
away
look
here
said
lettie
it
it
bleeding
go
and
get
some
water
emily
and
some
rags
come
on
sam
let
me
look
and
i
put
some
rags
round
it
come
along
she
took
the
child
and
stripped
him
of
his
grotesque
garments
trip
had
given
him
a
sharp
grab
on
the
thigh
before
he
had
realised
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
little
boy
it
was
not
much
however
and
lettie
soon
had
it
bathed
and
anointed
with
ointment
on
the
boy
body
were
several
scars
and
he
had
rough
times
lettie
tended
to
him
and
dressed
him
again
he
endured
these
attentions
like
a
trapped
wild
looking
at
us
never
opening
his
shrinking
slightly
when
lettie
had
put
on
him
his
torn
little
shirt
and
had
gathered
the
great
breeches
about
him
emily
went
to
him
to
coax
him
and
make
him
at
home
she
kissed
him
and
talked
to
him
with
her
full
vibration
of
emotional
caress
it
seemed
almost
to
suffocate
him
then
she
tried
to
feed
him
with
bread
and
milk
from
a
spoon
but
he
would
not
open
his
mouth
and
he
turned
his
head
away
leave
him
no
notice
of
him
said
lettie
lifting
him
into
the
chimney
seat
with
the
basin
of
bread
and
milk
beside
him
emily
fetched
the
two
kittens
out
of
their
basket
and
put
them
too
beside
him
i
wonder
how
many
eggs
he
got
said
the
father
laughing
softly
hush

lettie
when

you
think

to
canada

saxton

he
said

a
hurry

asked
in
reply

said

to
a
full
stop
then

said
taking
a
large
wedge
of
cheese
and
biting
a
piece
from
it

was
fixed
for

said
recovering
herself

holding
the
piece
of
cheese
up
before
him
as
he
was
evidently
nervous

advise
me
to

his
father
started
and
said
why

of

though
i

the
the
sake
of

poor
life
that
said
the
father
ruminating
george
laughed
a
bit
mucky
he
but
it
do
it
would
need
cyril
or
lettie
to
keep
me
alive
in
canada
it
was
a
bold

embarrassed

said
the
father
i
suppose
we
ca
have
everything
we
generally
have
to
put
up
with
the
next
best
we
lettie
laughed
lettie
flushed
furiously
i
do
know
she
said
you
can
generally
get
what
you
want
if
you
want
it
badly
enough
of
you
she
rose
and
went
across
to
sam
he
was
playing
with
the
kittens
one
was
patting
and
cuffing
his
bare
toe
which
had
poked
through
his
stocking
he
pushed
and
teased
the
little
scamp
with
his
toe
till
it
rushed
at
him
clinging
tickling
biting
till
he
gave
little
bubbles
of
laughter
quite
forgetful
of
us
then
the
kitten
was
tired
and
ran
off
lettie
shook
her
skirts
and
directly
the
two
playful
mites
rushed
upon
it
darting
round
her
rolling
head
over
heels
and
swinging
from
the
soft
cloth
suddenly
becoming
aware
that
they
felt
tired
the
young
things
trotted
away
and
cuddled
together
by
the
fender
where
in
an
instant
they
were
asleep
almost
as
suddenly
sam
sank
into
drowsiness
he
better
go
to
bed
said
the
father
put
him
in
my
bed
said
george
david
would
wonder
what
had
happened
will
you
go
to
bed
sam
asked
emily
holding
out
her
arms
to
him
and
immediately
startling
him
by
the
terrible
gentleness
of
her
persuasion
he
retreated
behind
lettie
come
along
said
the
latter
and
she
quickly
took
him
and
undressed
him
then
she
picked
him
up
and
his
bare
legs
hung
down
in
front
of
her
his
head
drooped
drowsily
on
to
her
shoulder
against
her
neck
she
put
down
her
face
to
touch
the
loose
riot
of
his
ruddy
hair
she
stood
so
quiet
still
and
wistful
for
a
few
moments
perhaps
she
was
vaguely
aware
that
the
attitude
was
beautiful
for
her
and
irresistibly
appealing
to
george
who
loved
above
all
in
her
her
delicate
dignity
of
tenderness
emily
waited
with
the
lighted
candle
for
her
some
moments
when
she
came
down
there
was
a
softness
about
her
now
said
i
to
myself
if
george
asks
her
again
he
is
wise
he
is
asleep
she
said
quietly
i
thinking
we
might
as
well
let
him
stop
while
we
here
should
we
george
said
the
father
eh
we
keep
him
here
while
we
lad
i
should
be
better
here
than
up
yonder
ah
so
much
it
is
good
of
you
said
lettie
oh
he
make
no
difference
said
the
father
not
a
bit
added
george
what
about
his
mother
asked
lettie
i
call
and
tell
her
in
the
morning
said
george
yes
she
said
call
and
tell
her
then
she
put
on
her
things
to
go
he
also
put
on
his
cap
are
you
coming
a
little
way
emily
i
asked
she
ran
laughing
with
bright
eyes
as
we
went
out
into
the
darkness
we
waited
for
them
at
the
wood
gate
we
all
lingered
not
knowing
what
to
say
lettie
said
finally
no
grass
is
emily
he
said
with
regret
and
hesitation
and
a
trifle
of
impatience
in
his
voice
and
his
manner
he
lingered
still
a
moment
she
she
struck
off
sharply
he
has
not
asked
her
the
idiot
i
said
to
myself
really
she
said
bitterly
when
we
were
going
up
the
garden
path
you
think
rather
quiet
folks
have
a
lot
in
them
but
it
only
are
mostly
fools
chapter
v
an
arrow
from
the
impatient
god
on
an
afternoon
three
or
four
days
after
the
recovery
of
sam
matters
became
complicated
george
as
usual
discovered
that
he
had
been
dawdling
in
the
portals
of
his
desires
when
the
doors
came
to
with
a
bang
then
he
hastened
to
knock
tell
her
he
said
i
will
come
up
tomorrow
after
her
i
coming
to
see
her
on
the
evening
of
that
morrow
the
first
person
to
put
in
an
appearance
was
a
garrulous
spinster
who
had
called
ostensibly
to
inquire
into
the
absence
of
the
family
from
church
i
said
to
elizabeth
what
a
if
anything
happens
to
them
just
now
and
the
wedding
is
put
off
i
felt
i
come
and
make
myself
nothing
had
happened
we
all
feel
interested
in
lettie
just
now
i
sure
everybody
is
talking
of
her
she
seems
in
the
really
think
we
shall
have
thunder
i
we
we
are
all
so
glad
that
tempest
is
content
with
a
wife
from
at
others
his
father
and
robert
and
the
were
none
of
them
to
be
suited
at
home
though
to
be
sure
the
wives
they
brought
were
they
were
many
a
one
robert
was
a
paltry
in
looks
or
manner
had
she
anything
to
boast
her
family
was
older
than
mine
family
was
much
to
make
up
for
what
she
lacked
in
other
things
that
i
could
easily
have
supplied
her
with
and
oh
dear
what
an
object
she
is
now
with
her
wisp
of
hair
and
her
spectacles
she
for
one
has
kept
much
of
her
youth
but
when
the
exact
date
dear
say
this
and
some
that
but
as
i
always
say
i
never
trust
a
say
it
is
so
nice
that
you
have
that
cousin
a
canon
to
come
down
for
the
service
beardsall
and
sir
walter
houghton
for
the
man
what
do
think
but
i
know
dear
i
know
you
do
like
to
treasure
up
these
secrets
do
you
you
are
greedy
for
all
the
good
things
just
now
she
shook
her
head
at
lettie
and
the
jet
ornaments
on
her
bonnet
twittered
like
a
thousand
wagging
little
tongues
then
she
sighed
and
was
about
to
recommence
her
song
when
she
happened
to
turn
her
head
and
to
espy
a
telegraph
boy
coming
up
the
path
oh
i
hope
nothing
is
wrong
hope
nothing
is
wrong
i
always
feel
so
terrified
of
a
telegram
you
better
not
open
it
yourself
your
brother
go
lettie
who
had
turned
pale
hurried
to
the
door
the
sky
was
very
was
a
mutter
of
thunder
it
all
right
said
lettie
trembling
it
only
to
say
he
coming
i
very
thankful
very
thankful
cried
the
spinster
it
might
have
been
so
much
worse
i
sure
i
never
open
a
telegram
without
feeling
as
if
i
was
opening
a
i
so
glad
dear
it
must
have
upset
you
what
news
to
take
back
to
the
village
supposing
something
had
happened
she
sighed
again
and
the
jet
drops
twinkled
ominously
in
the
thunder
light
as
if
declaring
they
would
make
something
of
it
yet
it
was
six
the
air
relaxed
a
little
and
the
thunder
was
silent
george
would
be
coming
about
seven
and
the
spinster
showed
no
signs
of
departure
and
leslie
might
arrive
at
any
moment
lettie
fretted
and
fidgeted
and
the
old
woman
gabbled
on
i
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
water
and
the
sky
the
day
had
been
uncertain
in
the
morning
it
was
warm
and
the
sunshine
had
played
and
raced
among
the
on
the
hills
later
great
cloud
masses
had
stalked
up
from
the
northwest
and
crowded
thick
across
the
sky
in
this
little
night
sleet
and
wind
and
rain
whirled
furiously
then
the
sky
had
laughed
at
us
again
in
the
sunshine
came
the
spinster
but
as
she
talked
over
the
hilltop
rose
the
wide
forehead
of
the
cloud
rearing
slowly
ominously
higher
a
first
messenger
of
storm
passed
darkly
over
the
sky
leaving
the
way
clear
again
i
will
go
round
to
highclose
said
lettie
i
am
sure
it
will
be
stormy
again
are
you
coming
down
the
road
miss
slaighter
or
do
you
mind
if
i
leave
you
i
will
go
dear
if
you
think
there
is
going
to
be
another
dread
it
so
perhaps
i
had
better
oh
it
will
not
come
over
for
an
hour
i
am
sure
we
read
the
weather
well
out
here
do
we
cyril
you
come
with
me
wo
you
we
three
set
off
the
gossip
leaning
on
her
toes
tripping
between
us
she
was
much
gratified
by
lettie
information
concerning
the
proposals
for
the
new
home
we
left
her
in
a
glow
of
congratulatory
smiles
on
the
highway
but
the
clouds
had
upreared
and
stretched
in
two
great
arms
reaching
overhead
the
little
spinster
hurried
along
but
the
black
hands
of
the
clouds
kept
pace
and
clutched
her
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
shuddered
in
the
trees
and
rushed
upon
her
cloak
blowing
its
bugles
an
icy
raindrop
smote
into
her
cheek
she
hurried
on
praying
fervently
for
her
bonnet
sake
that
she
might
reach
widow
harriman
cottage
before
the
burst
came
but
the
thunder
crashed
in
her
ear
and
a
host
of
hailstones
flew
at
her
in
despair
and
anguish
she
fled
from
under
the
ash
trees
she
reached
the
widow
garden
gate
when
out
leapt
the
lightning
full
at
her
put
me
in
the
she
cried
where
is
the
glancing
wildly
round
she
saw
a
ghost
it
was
the
reflection
of
the
sainted
spinster
hilda
slaighter
in
the
widow
mirror
a
reflection
with
a
bonnet
fallen
backwards
and
to
it
attached
a
thick
rope
of
hair
the
author
of
the
ghost
instinctively
twisted
to
look
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
saw
some
ends
of
grey
hair
and
fled
into
the
open
as
into
a
grave
we
had
gone
back
home
till
the
storm
was
over
and
then
restless
afraid
of
the
arrival
of
george
we
set
out
again
into
the
wet
evening
it
was
fine
and
chilly
and
already
a
mist
was
rising
from
nethermere
veiling
the
farther
shore
where
the
trees
rose
loftily
suggesting
groves
beyond
the
nile
the
birds
were
singing
riotously
the
fresh
green
hedge
glistened
vividly
and
glowed
again
with
intense
green
looking
at
the
water
i
perceived
a
delicate
flush
from
the
west
hiding
along
it
the
mist
licked
and
wreathed
up
the
shores
from
the
hidden
white
distance
came
the
mournful
cry
of
water
fowl
we
went
slowly
along
behind
a
heavy
cart
which
clanked
and
rattled
under
the
dripping
trees
with
the
hoofs
of
the
horse
moving
with
broad
thuds
in
front
we
passed
over
black
patches
where
the
ash
flowers
were
beaten
down
and
under
great
massed
clouds
of
green
sycamore
at
the
sudden
curve
of
the
road
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
stopped
to
break
off
a
spray
of
larch
where
the
soft
cones
were
heavy
as
raspberries
and
gay
like
flowers
with
petals
the
shaken
bough
spattered
a
heavy
shower
on
my
face
of
drops
so
cold
that
they
seemed
to
sink
into
my
blood
and
chill
it
hark
said
lettie
as
i
was
drying
my
face
there
was
the
quick
patter
of
a
coming
downhill
the
heavy
cart
was
drawn
across
the
road
to
rest
and
the
driver
hurried
to
turn
the
horse
back
it
moved
with
painful
slowness
and
we
stood
in
the
road
in
suspense
suddenly
before
we
knew
it
the
car
was
dropping
down
on
us
coming
at
us
in
a
curve
having
rounded
the
horse
and
cart
lettie
stood
faced
with
terror
leslie
saw
her
and
swung
round
the
wheels
on
the
sharp
curving
looking
only
to
see
that
he
should
miss
her
the
car
slid
sideways
the
mud
crackled
under
the
wheels
and
the
machine
went
crashing
into
nethermere
it
caught
the
edge
of
the
old
stone
wall
with
a
smash
then
for
a
few
moments
i
think
i
was
blind
when
i
saw
again
leslie
was
lying
across
the
broken
hedge
his
head
hanging
down
the
bank
his
face
covered
with
blood
the
car
rested
strangely
on
the
brink
of
the
water
crumpled
as
if
it
had
sunk
down
to
rest
lettie
with
hands
shuddering
was
wiping
the
blood
from
his
eyes
with
a
piece
of
her
underskirt
in
a
moment
she
said
he
is
not
us
take
him
us
take
him
quickly
i
ran
and
took
the
wicket
gate
off
its
hinges
and
laid
him
on
that
his
legs
trailed
down
but
we
carried
him
thus
she
at
the
feet
i
at
the
head
she
made
me
stop
and
put
him
down
i
thought
the
weight
was
too
much
for
her
but
it
was
not
that
i
ca
bear
to
see
his
hand
hanging
knocking
against
the
bushes
and
things
it
was
not
many
yards
to
the
house
a
maidservant
saw
us
came
running
out
and
went
running
back
like
the
frightened
lapwing
from
the
wounded
cat
we
waited
until
the
doctor
came
there
was
a
deep
graze
down
the
side
of
the
but
not
dangerous
there
was
a
cut
across
the
that
would
leave
a
scar
and
the
was
broken
i
stayed
until
he
had
recovered
consciousness
lettie
he
wanted
lettie
so
she
had
to
remain
at
highclose
all
night
i
went
home
to
tell
my
mother
when
i
went
to
bed
i
looked
across
at
the
lighted
windows
of
highclose
and
the
lights
trailed
mistily
towards
me
across
the
water
the
cedar
stood
dark
guard
against
the
house
bright
the
windows
were
like
the
stars
and
like
the
stars
covering
their
torment
in
brightness
the
sky
was
glittering
with
sharp
are
too
far
off
to
take
trouble
for
us
so
little
little
almost
to
nothingness
all
the
great
hollow
vastness
roars
overhead
and
the
stars
are
only
sparks
that
whirl
and
spin
in
the
restless
space
the
earth
must
listen
to
us
she
covers
her
face
with
a
thin
veil
of
mist
and
is
sad
she
soaks
up
our
blood
tenderly
in
the
darkness
grieving
and
in
the
light
she
soothes
and
reassures
us
here
on
our
earth
is
sympathy
and
hope
the
heavens
have
nothing
but
distances
a
talked
to
me
across
the
valley
talked
and
talked
endlessly
asking
and
answering
in
hoarse
tones
from
the
sleeping
meadows
the
monotonous
voice
that
on
past
summer
evenings
had
had
pleasant
notes
of
romance
now
was
intolerable
to
me
its
inflexible
harshness
and
cacophany
seemed
like
the
voice
of
fate
speaking
out
its
tuneless
perseverance
in
the
night
in
the
morning
lettie
came
home
wan
and
after
a
short
time
they
came
for
her
as
he
wanted
her
again
when
in
the
evening
i
went
to
see
george
he
too
was
very
despondent
it
no
good
now
said
i
you
should
have
insisted
and
made
your
own
destiny
so
he
drawled
in
his
best
reflective
manner
i
would
have
had
have
been
glad
if
you
done
as
you
wanted
with
her
she
wo
leave
him
till
he
strong
and
he
marry
her
before
then
you
should
have
had
the
courage
to
risk
always
too
careful
of
yourself
and
your
own
poor
never
could
brace
yourself
up
to
a
of
contempt
and
hard
usage
so
you
saved
your
feelings
and
much
i
could
he
began
not
looking
up
and
i
laughed
at
him
go
on
i
said
was
engaged
to
thought
you
were
too
good
to
be
rejected
he
was
very
pale
and
when
he
was
pale
the
tan
on
his
skin
looked
sickly
he
regarded
me
with
his
dark
eyes
which
were
now
full
of
misery
and
a
child
big
despair
and
nothing
else
i
completed
with
which
the
little
exhausted
gunboat
of
my
anger
wrecked
and
sank
utterly
yet
no
thoughts
would
spread
sail
on
the
sea
of
my
pity
i
was
like
water
that
heaves
with
yearning
and
is
still
leslie
was
very
ill
for
some
time
he
had
a
slight
brain
fever
and
was
delirious
insisting
that
lettie
was
leaving
him
she
stayed
most
of
her
days
at
highclose
one
day
in
june
he
lay
resting
on
a
deck
chair
in
the
shade
of
the
cedar
and
she
was
sitting
by
him
it
was
a
yellow
sultry
day
when
all
the
atmosphere
seemed
inert
and
all
things
were
languid
do
you
think
dear
she
said
it
would
be
better
for
us
not
to
marry
he
lifted
his
head
nervously
from
the
cushions
his
face
was
emblazoned
with
a
livid
red
bar
on
a
field
of
white
and
he
looked
worn
wistful
do
you
mean
not
yet
he
asked
perhaps
never
ha
he
laughed
sinking
down
again
i
must
be
getting
like
myself
again
if
you
begin
to
tease
me
but
she
said
struggling
valiantly
i
not
sure
i
ought
to
marry
you
he
laughed
again
though
a
little
apprehensively
are
you
afraid
i
shall
always
be
weak
in
my
noddle
he
asked
but
you
wait
a
month
no
that
does
bother
oh
does
it
silly
it
myself
i
sure
i
made
no
complaint
about

i
wish
you
let
me
go
i
a
strong
man
to
hold

i
look
at
my
muscular
paw
held
out
his
hands
frail
and
white
with
sickness

i
want
you
to
let
me
go
i
do

you
do
love
me
do
know
anything
about
it
but
i
you
what
do
they
say
of
one
flesh
why
he
whispered
like
a
child
that
is
told
some
tale
of
mystery
she
looked
at
him
as
he
lay
propped
upon
his
elbow
turning
towards
hers
his
white
face
of
fear
and
perplexity
like
a
child
that
can
not
understand
and
is
afraid
and
wants
to
cry
then
slowly
tears
gathered
full
in
her
eyes
and
she
wept
from
pity
and
despair
this
excited
him
terribly
he
got
up
from
his
chair
and
the
cushions
fell
on
to
the
grass
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
lettie
it
me
you
want
me
now
that
it
me
tell
me
now
tell
me
grasped
her
wrists
and
tried
to
pull
her
hands
from
her
face
the
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
she
felt
him
trembling
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
alarmed
her
from
herself
she
hastily
smeared
the
tears
from
her
eyes
got
up
and
put
her
arms
round
him
he
hid
his
head
on
her
shoulder
and
sobbed
while
she
bent
over
him
and
so
they
cried
out
their
cries
till
they
were
ashamed
looking
round
to
see
if
anyone
were
near
then
she
hurried
about
picking
up
the
cushions
making
him
lie
down
and
arranging
him
comfortably
so
that
she
might
be
busy
he
was
querulous
like
a
sick
indulged
child
he
would
have
her
arm
under
his
shoulders
and
her
face
near
his
well
he
said
smiling
faintly
again
after
a
time
you
are
naughty
to
give
us
such
rough
it
for
the
pleasure
of
making
up
bad
little
you
she
kept
close
to
him
and
he
did
not
see
the
wince
and
quiver
of
her
lips
i
wish
i
was
strong
we
go
ride
on
you
have
to
behave
then
do
you
think
i

she
said
why
i
do
believe

can
lay
me
down
and

then

away
from
me
again
my
arm
is
dead
she
drew
it
from
beneath
him
standing
up
swinging
it
smiling
because
it
hurt
her
oh
my
a
shame
oh
i
am
a
brute

kiddish
brute
i

she
smiled
at
him
again
chapter
vi
the
courting
during
leslie
illness
i
strolled
down
to
the
mill
one
saturday
evening
i
met
george
tramping
across
the
yard
with
a
couple
of
buckets
of
swill
and
eleven
young
pigs
rushing
squealing
about
his
legs
shrieking
in
an
agony
of
suspense
he
poured
the
stuff
into
a
trough
with
luscious
gurgle
and
instantly
ten
noses
were
dipped
in
and
ten
little
mouths
began
to
slobber
though
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
ten
yet
they
shouldered
and
shoved
and
struggled
to
capture
a
larger
space
and
many
little
trotters
dabbled
and
spilled
the
stuff
and
the
ten
sucking
clapping
snouts
twitched
fiercely
and
twenty
little
eyes
glared
askance
like
so
many
points
of
wrath
they
gave
uneasy
gasping
grunts
in
their
haste
the
unhappy
eleventh
rushed
from
point
to
point
trying
to
push
in
his
snout
but
for
his
pains
he
got
rough
squeezing
and
sharp
grabs
on
his
ears
then
he
lifted
up
his
face
and
screamed
screams
of
grief
and
wrath
unto
the
evening
sky
but
the
ten
little
gluttons
only
twitched
their
ears
to
make
sure
there
was
no
danger
in
the
noise
and
they
sucked
harder
with
much
spilling
and
slobbing
george
laughed
like
a
sardonic
jove
but
at
last
he
gave
ear
and
kicked
the
ten
gluttons
from
the
trough
and
allowed
the
residue
to
the
eleventh
this
one
poor
wretch
almost
wept
with
relief
as
he
sucked
and
swallowed
in
sobs
casting
his
little
eyes
apprehensively
upwards
though
he
did
not
lift
his
nose
from
the
trough
as
he
heard
the
vindictive
shrieks
of
ten
little
fiends
kept
at
bay
by
george
the
solitary
feeder
shivering
with
apprehension
rubbed
the
wood
bare
with
his
snout
then
turning
up
to
heaven
his
eyes
of
gratitude
he
reluctantly
left
the
trough
i
expected
to
see
the
ten
fall
upon
him
and
devour
him
but
they
did
not
they
rushed
upon
the
empty
trough
and
rubbed
the
wood
still
drier
shrieking
with
misery
how
like
life
i
laughed
fine
litter
said
george
there
were
fourteen
only
that
damned
circe
went
and
ate
three
of
before
we
got
at
her
the
great
ugly
sow
came
leering
up
as
he
spoke
why
do
you
fatten
her
up
and
devour
her
the
old
gargoyle
she
an
offence
to
the
universe
a
fine
sow
i
snorted
and
he
laughed
and
the
old
sow
grunted
with
contempt
and
her
little
eyes
twisted
towards
us
with
a
demoniac
leer
as
she
rolled
past
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
going
out
i
going
courting
he
replied
grinning
oh
were
you
can
come
if
you
tell
me
where
i
make
mistakes
since
you
an
expert
on
such
matters
do
you
get
on
very
well
then
i
asked
oh
all
easy
enough
when
you
do
care
a
damn
besides
you
can
always
have
a
johnny
walker
that
the
best
of
courting
at
the
ram
inn
i
go
and
get
ready
in
the
kitchen
emily
sat
grinding
out
some
stitching
from
a
big
old
that
stood
on
the
table
before
her
she
was
making
shirts
for
sam
i
presumed
that
little
fellow
who
was
installed
at
the
farm
was
seated
by
her
side
firing
off
words
from
a
reading
book
the
machine
rumbled
and
rattled
on
like
a
whole
factory
at
work
for
an
inch
or
two
during
which
time
sam
shouted
in
shrill
explosions
like
irregular
pistol
shots
put
cried
emily
from
the
machine
shrilled
the
child
the
the
machine
broke
down
and
frightened
by
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
the
boy
stopped
in
bewilderment
and
looked
round
go
on
said
emily
as
she
poked
in
the
teeth
of
the
old
machine
with
the
scissors
then
pulled
and
prodded
again
he
began
here
he
died
off
again
made
nervous
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
the
stillness
emily
sucked
a
piece
of
cotton
and
pushed
it
through
the
needle
now
go
on
she
said
you
may
shouted
away
reassured
by
the
rumble
of
the
machine
root
shrieked
emily
as
she
guided
the
stuff
through
the
doddering
jaws
of
the
machine
root
echoed
the
boy
and
he
went
off
with
these
crackers
next
one
cried
emily
began
the
boy
what
cried
emily
wait
a
bit
cried
emily
and
then
the
machine
broke
down
hang
she
ejaculated
hang
shouted
the
child
she
laughed
and
leaned
over
to
him
the
oil
in
the
pan
to
boil
while
i
toil
in
the
cyril
i
never
knew
you
were
there
go
along
now
sam
david
be
at
the
back
somewhere
he
in
the
bottom
garden
said
i
and
the
child
ran
out
directly
george
came
in
from
the
scullery
drying
himself
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
as
he
rubbed
himself
and
surveyed
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
above
the
high
mantelpiece
he
looked
at
himself
and
smiled
i
wondered
that
he
found
such
satisfaction
in
his
image
seeing
that
there
was
a
gap
in
his
chin
and
an
uncertain
appearance
in
one
cheek
saxton
still
held
this
mirror
an
object
of
dignity
it
was
fairly
large
and
had
a
frame
but
it
left
gaps
and
spots
and
scratches
in
one
countenance
and
even
where
it
was
brightest
it
gave
one
reflection
a
dim
aspect
notwithstanding
george
smiled
at
himself
as
he
combed
his
hair
and
twisted
his
moustache
you
seem
to
make
a
good
impression
on
yourself
said
i
i
was
thinking
i
looked
all
of
face
to
go
courting
with
he
replied
laughing
you
just
arrange
a
patch
of
black
to
come
and
hide
your
you
all
right
i
always
used
to
think
said
emily
that
the
black
spots
had
swallowed
so
many
faces
they
were
full
up
and
could
take
any
the
rest
was
misty
because
there
were
so
many
faces
lapped
one
over
the
you
do
see
yourself
a
bit
said
he
on
a
background
of
your
ancestors
i
always
think
when
you
stop
in
an
old
place
like
this
you
sort
of
keep
company
with
your
ancestors
too
much
i
sometimes
feel
like
a
bit
of
the
old
building
walking
about
the
old
feelings
of
the
old
folks
stick
to
you
like
the
lichens
on
the
walls
you
sort
of
get
hoary
that
true
asserted
the
father
people
whose
families
have
shifted
about
much
do
know
how
it
feels
that
why
i
going
to
canada
and
i
going
in
a
pub
said
george
where
it
quite
of
life
life
echoed
emily
with
contempt
that
the
word
my
wench
replied
her
brother
lapsing
into
the
dialect
that
what
i
after
we
known
such
a
lot
an
we
known
nöwt
you
said
the
father
turning
to
me
you
stay
in
one
place
generation
after
generation
and
you
seem
to
get
proud
an
look
on
things
outside
as
foolishness
there
many
a
thing
as
any
common
man
knows
as
we
have
a
glimpse
of
we
keep
on
thinking
and
feeling
the
same
year
after
year
till
we
only
got
one
side
an
i
suppose
they
done
it
before
us
it
an
god
bless
you
to
th
owd
place
granfeythers
grammothers
laughed
george
as
he
ran
an
off
we
go
on
the
gallivant
he
shouted
from
the
landing
his
father
shook
his
head
saying
i
ca
make
out
how
it
is
he
so
different
i
suppose
it
being
in
we
went
into
the
barn
to
get
the
bicycles
to
cycle
over
to
greymede
george
struck
a
match
to
look
for
his
pump
and
he
noticed
a
great
spider
scuttle
off
into
the
corner
of
the
wall
and
sit
peeping
out
at
him
like
a
hoary
little
ghoul
how
are
you
old
chap
said
george
nodding
to
thought
he
looked
like
an
old
grandfather
of
mine
he
said
to
me
laughing
as
he
pumped
up
the
tyres
of
the
old
bicycle
for
me
it
was
saturday
night
so
the
bar
parlour
of
the
ram
inn
was
fairly
full
hello
was
the
cry
followed
by
a
nod
and
a
good
evenin
to
me
who
was
a
stranger
in
the
parlour
it
raïght
for
thaïgh
said
a
fat
young
fellow
with
an
unwilling
white
mustache
can
as
much
as
ter
likes
ter
as
well
as
th
lass
an
it
costs
thee
at
which
the
room
laughed
taking
pipes
from
mouths
to
do
so
george
sat
down
looking
round
on
a
bit
said
a
man
tha
mun

to
a

cried
the
fat
young
man
exploding
fancy
th
owd
lady
sayin
prayers
be
enough
ter
false
teeth
drop
out
the
room
laughed
they
began
to
tell
tales
about
the
old
landlady
she
had
practised
in
which
she
was
very
skilful
people
came
to
her
from
long
distances
that
she
might
divine
their
trouble
and
make
right
their
limbs
she
would
accept
no
fee
once
she
had
gone
up
to
fullwood
to
give
him
a
piece
of
her
mind
inasmuch
as
he
had
let
a
child
go
for
three
weeks
with
a
broken
whilst
treating
him
for
dislocation
the
doctor
had
tried
the
high
hand
with
her
since
when
wherever
he
went
the
miners
placed
their
hands
on
their
shoulders
and
groaned
my
here
meg
came
in
she
gave
a
bright
quick
bird
like
look
at
george
and
flushed
a
brighter
red
i
thought
you
was
cummin
she
said
dunna
thee
none
stop
away
said
the
man
she
brought
us
glasses
of
whisky
and
moved
about
supplying
the
men
who
chaffed
with
her
honestly
and
then
she
went
out
but
we
remained
in
our
corner
the
men
talked
on
the
most
peculiar
subjects
there
was
a
bitter
discussion
as
to
whether
london
is
or
is
not
a
matter
was
thrashed
out
with
heat
then
an
embryo
artist
set
the
room
ablaze
by
declaring
there
were
only
three
colours
red
yellow
and
blue
and
the
rest
were
not
colours
they
were
mixtures
this
amounted
almost
to
atheism
and
one
man
asked
the
artist
to
dare
to
declare
that
his
brown
breeches
were
not
a
colour
which
the
artist
did
and
almost
had
to
fight
for
it
next
they
came
to
strength
and
george
won
a
bet
of
five
shillings
by
lifting
a
piano
then
they
settled
down
and
talked
sex
sotto
voce
one
man
giving
startling
accounts
of
japanese
and
chinese
prostitutes
in
liverpool
after
this
the
talk
split
up
a
farmer
began
to
counsel
george
how
to
manage
the
farm
attached
to
the
inn
another
bargained
with
him
about
horses
and
argued
about
cattle
a
tailor
advised
him
thickly
to
speculate
and
unfolded
a
fine
secret
by
which
a
man
might
make
money
if
he
had
the
go
to
do
on
till
eleven
then
bill
came
and
called
time
and
the
place
was
empty
and
the
room
shivered
as
a
little
fresh
air
came
in
between
the
foul
tobacco
smoke
and
the
smell
of
drink
and
foul
breath
we
were
both
affected
by
the
whisky
we
had
drunk
i
was
ashamed
to
find
that
when
i
put
out
my
hand
to
take
my
glass
or
to
strike
a
match
i
missed
my
mark
and
fumbled
my
hands
seemed
hardly
to
belong
to
me
and
my
feet
were
not
much
more
sure
yet
i
was
acutely
conscious
of
every
change
in
myself
and
in
him
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
make
my
body
drunk
but
could
never
intoxicate
my
mind
which
roused
itself
and
kept
the
sharpest
guard
george
was
frankly
half
drunk
his
eyelids
sloped
over
his
eyes
and
his
speech
was
thick
when
he
put
out
his
hand
he
knocked
over
his
glass
and
the
stuff
was
spilled
all
over
the
table
he
only
laughed
i
too
felt
a
great
prompting
to
giggle
on
every
occasion
and
i
marvelled
at
myself
meg
came
into
the
room
when
all
the
men
had
gone
come
on
my
duck
he
said
waving
his
arm
with
the
generous
flourish
of
a
tipsy
man
come
an
sit
sha
you
come
in
th
kitchen
she
asked
looking
round
on
the
tables
where
pots
and

generous
that

chapter
vii
the
fascination
of
the
forbidden
apple
on
the
first
sunday
in
june
when
lettie
knew
she
would
keep
her
engagement
with
leslie
and
when
she
was
having
a
day
at
home
from
highclose
she
got
ready
to
go
down
to
the
mill
we
were
in
mourning
for
an
aunt
so
she
wore
a
dress
of
fine
black
voile
and
a
black
hat
with
long
feathers
then
when
i
looked
at
her
fair
hands
and
her
arms
closely
covered
in
the
long
black
cuffs
of
her
sleeves
i
felt
keenly
my
old
shielding
indulgent
it
was
a
windy
sunny
day
in
shelter
the
heat
was
passionate
but
in
the
open
the
wind
scattered
its
fire
every
now
and
then
a
white
cloud
broad
based
blue
shadowed
travelled
slowly
along
the
after
the
forerunner
small
in
the
distance
and
trailing
over
us
a
chill
shade
a
gloom
which
we
watched
creep
on
over
the
water
over
the
wood
and
the
hill
these
royal
rounded
clouds
had
sailed
all
day
along
the
same
route
from
the
harbour
of
the
south
to
the
wastes
in
the
northern
sky
following
the
swift
wild
geese
the
brook
hurried
along
singing
only
here
and
there
lingering
to
whisper
to
the
secret
bushes
then
setting
off
afresh
with
a
new
snatch
of
song
the
fowls
pecked
staidly
in
the
farmyard
with
sabbath
decorum
occasionally
a
lost
sportive
would
wander
across
the
yard
and
ruffle
them
and
they
resented
it
the
pigs
were
asleep
in
the
sun
giving
faint
grunts
now
and
then
from
sheer
luxury
i
saw
a
squirrel
go
darting
down
the
mossy
garden
wall
up
into
the
laburnum
tree
where
he
lay
flat
along
the
bough
and
listened
suddenly
away
he
went
chuckling
to
himself
gyp
all
at
once
set
off
barking
but
i
soothed
her
down
it
was
the
unusual
sight
of
lettie
dark
dress
that
startled
her
i
suppose
we
went
quietly
into
the
kitchen
saxton
was
just
putting
a
chicken
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
flannel
on
the
warm
hob
to
coax
it
into
life
it
looked
very
feeble
george
was
asleep
with
his
head
in
his
arms
on
the
table
the
father
was
asleep
on
the
sofa
very
comfortable
and
admirable
i
heard
emily
fleeing
up
stairs
presumably
to
dress
he
stays
out
so
at
the
ram
inn
whispered
the
mother
in
a
high
whisper
looking
at
george
and
then
he
up
at
get
his
proper
rest
she
turned
to
the
chicks
and
continued
in
her
the
mother
left
them
just
before
they
hatched
out
so
been
bringing
them
on
here
this
one
a
bit
thought
i
hot
him
up
a
bit
she
laughed
with
a
quaint
little
frown
of
deprecation
eight
or
nine
yellow
fluffy
little
mites
were
cheeping
and
scuffling
in
the
fender
lettie
bent
over
them
to
touch
them
they
were
tame
and
ran
among
her
fingers
suddenly
george
mother
gave
a
loud
cry
and
rushed
to
the
fire
there
was
a
smell
of
singed
down
the
chicken
had
toddled
into
the
fire
and
gasped
its
faint
gasp
among
the
cokes
the
father
jumped
from
the
sofa
george
sat
up
with
wide
eyes
lettie
gave
a
little
cry
and
a
shudder
trip
rushed
round
and
began
to
bark
there
was
a
smell
of
cooked
meat
there
goes
number
one
said
the
mother
with
her
queer
little
laugh
it
made
me
laugh
too
what
a
a
matter
asked
the
father
excitedly
it
a
chicken
been
and
walked
into
the
put
it
on
the
hob
to
warm
explained
his
wife
could
think
what
was
up
he
said
and
dropped
his
head
to
trace
gradually
the
border
between
sleeping
and
waking
george
sat
and
smiled
at
us
faintly
he
was
too
dazed
to
speak
his
chest
still
leaned
against
the
table
and
his
arms
were
spread
out
thereon
but
he
lifted
his
face
and
looked
at
lettie
with
his
dazed
dark
eyes
and
smiled
faintly
at
her
his
hair
was
all
ruffled
and
his
shirt
collar
unbuttoned
then
he
got
up
slowly
pushing
his
chair
back
with
a
loud
noise
and
stretched
himself
pressing
his
arms
upwards
with
a
long
heavy
stretch
he
said
bending
his
arms
and
then
letting
them
drop
to
his
sides
i
never
thought
you
come
i
wanted
to
come
and
see
sha
have
many
more
chances
said
lettie
turning
from
him
and
yet
looking
at
him
again
i
suppose
not
he
said
subsiding
into
quiet
then
there
was
silence
for
some
time
the
mother
began
to
enquire
after
leslie
and
kept
the
conversation
up
till
emily
came
down
blushing
and
smiling
and
glad
are
you
coming
out
said
she
there
are
two
or
three
robins
nests
and
a
i
think
i
leave
my
hat
said
lettie
unpinning
it
as
she
spoke
and
shaking
her
hair
when
she
was
free
saxton
insisted
on
her
taking
a
long
white
silk
scarf
emily
also
wrapped
her
hair
in
a
gauze
scarf
and
looked
beautiful
george
came
out
with
us
coatless
hatless
his
waistcoat
all
unbuttoned
as
he
was
we
crossed
the
orchard
over
the
old
bridge
and
went
to
where
the
slopes
ran
down
to
the
lower
pond
a
bank
all
covered
with
nettles
and
scattered
with
a
hazel
bush
or
two
among
the
nettles
old
pans
were
rusting
and
old
coarse
pottery
cropped
up
we
came
upon
a
kettle
heavily
coated
with
lime
emily
bent
down
and
looked
and
then
we
peeped
in
there
were
the
robin
birds
with
their
yellow
beaks
stretched
so
wide
apart
i
feared
they
would
never
close
them
again
among
the
naked
little
mites
that
begged
from
us
so
blindly
and
confidently
were
huddled
three
eggs
they
are
like
irish
children
peeping
out
of
a
cottage
said
emily
with
the
family
fondness
for
romantic
similes
we
went
on
to
where
a
tin
lay
with
the
lid
pressed
back
and
inside
it
snug
and
neat
was
another
nest
with
six
eggs
cheek
to
cheek
how
warm
they
are
said
lettie
touching
them
you
can
fairly
feel
the
mother
breast
he
tried
to
put
his
hand
into
the
tin
but
the
space
was
too
small
and
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
and
smiled
you
think
the
breast
had
marked
them
with
red
said
emily
as
we
went
up
the
orchard
side
we
saw
three
wide
displays
of
coloured
pieces
of
pots
arranged
at
the
foot
of
three
trees
look
said
emily
those
are
the
children
houses
you
do
know
how
our
mollie
gets
all
sam
pretty
is
a
cajoling
hussy
the
two
looked
at
each
other
again
smiling
up
on
the
in
the
full
glitter
of
light
we
looked
round
where
the
blades
of
clustering
corn
were
softly
healing
the
red
bosom
of
the
hill
the
larks
were
overhead
among
the
sunbeams
we
straggled
away
across
the
grass
the
field
was
all
afroth
with
cowslips
a
yellow
glittering
shaking
froth
on
the
still
green
of
the
grass
we
trailed
our
shadows
across
the
fields
extinguishing
the
sunshine
on
the
flowers
as
we
went
the
air
was
tingling
with
the
scent
of
blossoms
look
at
the
cowslips
all
shaking
with
laughter
said
emily
and
she
tossed
back
her
head
and
her
dark
eyes
sparkled
among
the
flow
of
gauze
lettie
was
on
in
front
flitting
darkly
across
the
field
bending
over
the
flowers
stooping
to
the
earth
like
a
sable
persephone
come
into
freedom
george
had
left
her
at
a
little
distance
hunting
for
something
in
the
grass
he
stopped
and
remained
standing
in
one
place
gradually
as
if
unconsciously
she
drew
near
to
him
and
when
she
lifted
her
head
after
stooping
to
pick
some
little
grass
flowers
she
laughed
with
a
slight
surprise
to
see
him
so
near
ah
she
said
i
thought
i
was
all
alone
in
the
a
splendid
was
so
nice
like
eve
in
a
meadow
in
adam
shadow
somewhere
on
the
grass
said
i
adam
she
asserted
frowning
slightly
and
laughing
who
ever
would
want
streets
of
gold
emily
was
saying
to
me
when
you
can
have
a
field
of
cowslips
look
at
that
hedgebottom
that
gets
the
south
stream
and
glitter
of
buttercups
those
jews
always
had
an
eye
to
the
filthy
even
made
heaven
out
of
it
laughed
lettie
and
turning
to
him
she
said
do
you
wish
we
were
like
look
like
peewits
should
you
love
flying
and
wheeling
and
sparkling
in
the
wind
she
lifted
her
eyelids
and
vibrated
the
question
he
flushed
bending
over
the
ground
look
he
said
here
a
larkie
once
a
horse
had
left
a
hoofprint
in
the
soft
meadow
now
the
larks
had
rounded
softened
the
cup
and
had
laid
there
three
eggs
lettie
sat
down
and
leaned
over
the
nest
he
leaned
above
her
the
wind
running
over
the
flower
heads
peeped
in
at
the
little
brown
buds
and
bounded
off
again
gladly
the
big
clouds
sent
messages
to
them
down
the
shadows
and
ran
in
raindrops
to
touch
them
i
wish
she
said
i
wish
we
were
free
like
that
if
we
could
put
everything
safely
in
a
little
place
in
the
we
have
a
good
time
as
well
as
the
larks
i
do
see
said
he
why
we
ca
i
know
we
ca
she
looked
at
him
fiercely
why
ca
you
he
asked
you
know
we
know
as
well
as
i
do
she
replied
and
her
whole
soul
challenged
him
we
have
to
consider
things
she
added
he
dropped
his
head
he
was
afraid
to
make
the
struggle
to
rouse
himself
to
decide
the
question
for
her
she
turned
away
and
went
kicking
through
the
flowers
he
picked
up
the
blossoms
she
had
left
by
the
were
still
warm
from
her
followed
her
she
walked
on
towards
the
end
of
the
field
the
long
strands
of
her
white
scarf
running
before
her
then
she
leaned
back
to
the
wind
while
he
caught
her
up
do
you
want
your
flowers
he
asked
humbly
no
be
dead
before
i
got
them
away
you
look
absurd
with
a
posy
he
did
as
he
was
bidden
they
came
near
the
hedge
a
tree
blossomed
up
among
the
blue
you
may
get
me
a
bit
of
that
blossom
said
she
and
suddenly
no
i
can
reach
it
myself
whereupon
she
stretched
upward
and
pulled
several
sprigs
of
the
pink
and
white
and
put
it
in
her
dress
is
it
pretty
she
said
and
she
began
to
laugh
ironically
pointing
to
the
pretty
petals
and
stamens
like
yellow
hair
and
buds
like
lips
promising
something
nice
stopped
and
looked
at
him
flickering
with
a
smile
then
she
pointed
to
the
ovary
beneath
the
flower
and
said
result
she
continued
to
look
at
him
and
to
smile
he
said
nothing
so
they
went
on
to
where
they
could
climb
the
fence
into
the
spinney
she
climbed
to
the
top
rail
holding
by
an
oak
bough
then
she
let
him
lift
her
down
bodily
ah
she
said
you
like
to
show
me
how
strong
you
veritable
samson
mocked
although
she
had
invited
him
with
her
eyes
to
take
her
in
his
arms
we
were
entering
the
spinney
of
black
poplar
in
the
hedge
was
an
elm
tree
with
myriads
of
dark
dots
pointed
against
the
bright
sky
myriads
of
clusters
of
flaky
green
fruit
look
at
that
elm
she
said
you
think
it
was
in
full
leaf
you
do
you
know
why
it
so
prolific
no
he
said
with
a
curious
questioning
drawl
of
the
monosyllable
it
casting
its
bread
upon
the
it
is
dying
so
it
puts
out
all
its
strength
and
loads
its
boughs
with
the
last
fruit
it
be
dead
next
year
if
you
here
then
come
and
see
look
at
the
ivy
the
suave
smooth
ivy
with
its
fingers
in
the
trees
throat
trees
know
how
to
die
you
do
with
her
whimsical
moods
she
tormented
him
she
was
at
the
bottom
a
seething
confusion
of
emotion
and
she
wanted
to
make
him
likewise
if
we
were
trees
with
of
being
fine
humans
with
free
active
should
hug
our
thinning
lives
should
we
i
suppose
we
should
you
for
sacrificing
the
next
reminds
you
of
schopenhauer
does
it
the
next
generation
or
love
or
anything
he
did
not
answer
her
she
was
too
swift
for
him
they
passed
on
under
the
poplars
which
were
hanging
strings
of
green
beads
above
them
there
was
a
little
open
space
with
tufts
of
bluebells
lettie
stooped
over
a
that
lay
on
the
ground
on
its
breast
its
wings
half
spread
she
took
it
eyes
were
bursten
and
bloody
she
felt
its
breast
ruffling
the
dimming
iris
on
its
throat
it
been
fighting
he
said
what
mate
she
asked
looking
at
him
i
do
know
he
answered
quite
cold
under
the
feathers
i
think
a
must
enjoy
being
fought
being
won
especially
if
the
right
one
won
it
would
be
a
fine
pleasure
to
see
them
you
think
she
said
torturing
him
the
claws
are
fell
dead
off
the
perch
he
replied
ah
poor
was
sat
and
waited
for
the
other
had
won
do
you
think
life
is
very
cruel
love
the
cruellest
of
all
he
laughed
bitterly
under
the
pain
of
her
soft
sad
tones
let
me
bury
have
done
with
the
beaten
lover
but
we
make
him
a
pretty
grave
she
scooped
a
hole
in
the
dark
soil
and
snatching
a
handful
of
bluebells
threw
them
in
on
top
of
the
dead
bird
then
she
smoothed
the
soil
over
all
and
pressed
her
white
hands
on
the
black
loam
there
she
said
knocking
her
hands
one
against
the
other
to
shake
off
the
soil
he
done
with
come
on
he
followed
her
speechless
with
his
emotion
the
spinney
opened
out
the
ferns
were
serenely
uncoiling
the
bluebells
stood
grouped
with
blue
curls
mingled
in
the
freer
spaces
flowered
in
nebulæ
and
gave
an
undertone
of
dark
purple
with
primroses
for
planets
in
the
night
there
was
a
slight
drift
of
woodruff
sweet
hay
scenting
the
air
under
the
boughs
on
a
wet
bank
was
the
design
of
golden
saxifrage
glistening
unholily
as
if
varnished
by
its
minister
the
snail
george
and
lettie
crushed
the
veined
belles
of
and
broke
the
silken
mosses
what
did
it
matter
to
them
what
they
broke
or
crushed
over
the
fence
of
the
spinney
was
the
hillside
scattered
with
old
thorn
trees
there
the
little
grey
lichens
held
up
ruby
balls
to
us
unnoticed
what
did
it
matter
when
all
the
great
red
apples
were
being
shaken
from
the
tree
to
be
left
to
rot
if
i
were
a
man
said
lettie
i
would
go
out
west
and
be
free
i
should
love
it
she
took
the
scarf
from
her
head
and
let
it
wave
out
on
the
wind
the
colour
was
warm
in
her
face
with
climbing
and
her
curls
were
freed
by
the
wind
sparkling
and
rippling
not
a
man
he
said
looking
at
her
and
speaking
with
timid
bitterness
no
she
laughed
if
i
were
i
would
shape
would
i
have
my
own
way
and
do
you
now
do
want
it
i
got
it
when
i
had
my
way
i
somebody
to
take
it
back
from
me
she
put
her
head
back
and
looked
at
him
sideways
laughing
through
the
glitter
of
her
hair
they
came
to
the
kennels
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
great
stone
water
trough
and
put
her
hands
in
the
water
moving
them
gently
like
submerged
flowers
through
the
clear
pool
i
love
to
see
myself
in
the
water
she
said
i
do
mean
the
water
that
how
i
should
like
to
be
out
west
to
have
a
little
lake
of
my
own
and
swim
with
my
limbs
quite
free
in
the
water
do
you
swim
well
he
asked
fairly
i
would
race
your
little
lake
she
laughed
took
her
hands
out
of
the
water
and
watched
the
clear
drops
trickle
off
then
she
lifted
her
head
suddenly
at
some
thought
or
other
she
looked
across
the
valley
and
saw
the
red
roofs
of
the
mill
ilion
fatalis
incestusque
judex
et
mulier
peregrina
vertit
in
what
that
he
said
nothing
that
a
private
trough
exclaimed
a
thin
voice
high
like
a
cry
we
started
in
surprise
to
see
a
tall
man
looking
at
us
and
away
from
us
nervously
fidgeting
uneasily
some
ten
yards
off
is
it
said
lettie
looking
at
her
wet
hands
which
she
proceeded
to
dry
on
a
fragment
of
a
handkerchief
you
must
meddle
with
it
said
the
man
in
the
same
reedy
oboe
voice
then
he
turned
his
head
away
and
his
pale
grey
eyes
roved
the
he
had
courage
he
turned
his
back
to
us
shading
his
eyes
to
continue
his
scrutiny
he
walked
hurriedly
a
few
steps
then
craned
his
neck
peering
into
the
valley
and
hastened
a
dozen
yards
in
another
direction
again
stretching
and
peering
about
then
he
went
indoors
he
is
pretending
to
look
for
somebody
said
lettie
but
it
only
because
he
afraid
we
shall
think
he
came
out
just
to
look
at
us
they
laughed
suddenly
a
woman
appeared
at
the
gate
she
had
pale
eyes
like
the
man
you
get
bright
disease
sitting
on
that
there
damp
stone
she
said
to
lettie
who
at
once
rose
apologetically
i
ought
to
know
continued
the
woman
my
own
mother
died
of
it
indeed
murmured
lettie
i
sorry
yes
continued
the
woman
it
behooves
you
to
be
careful
do
you
come
from
strelley
mill
farm
she
asked
suddenly
of
george
surveying
his
shameful
déshabille
with
bitter
reproof
he
admitted
the
imputation
and
you
going
to
leave
are
you
which
also
he
admitted
humph
s
get
some
neighbours
it
a
dog
life
for
loneliness
i
suppose
you
knew
the
last
lot
that
was
here
another
brief
admission
a
dirty
dirty
beagle
she
must
have
been
you
should
just
seen
these
grates
yes
said
lettie
i
have
seen
them
state
but
come
in
you
see
a
difference
they
entered
out
of
curiosity
the
kitchen
was
indeed
different
it
was
clean
and
sparkling
warm
with
bright
red
chintzes
on
the
sofa
and
on
every
chair
cushion
unfortunately
the
effect
was
spoiled
by
green
and
yellow
antimaccassars
and
by
a
profusion
of
paper
and
woollen
flowers
there
were
three
cases
of
woollen
flowers
and
on
the
wall
four
fans
stitched
over
with
ruffled
green
and
yellow
paper
adorned
with
yellow
paper
roses
carnations
arum
lilies
and
poppies
there
were
also
wall
pockets
full
of
paper
flowers
while
the
wood
outside
was
loaded
with
blossom
yes
said
lettie
there
is
a
difference
the
woman
swelled
and
looked
round
the
man
peeped
from
behind
the
christian
long
blaring
trumpets
shrank
again
the
woman
darted
at
his
pipe
which
he
had
put
on
a
piece
of
newspaper
on
the
hob
and
blew
some
imaginary
ash
from
it
then
she
caught
sight
of
some
the
fireplace
there
she
cried
i
knew
it
i
could
leave
him
one
second
i
have
work
enough
burning
wood
but
he
must
be
i
only
pushed
a
piece
in
between
the
bars
complained
the
from
behind
the
paper
pushed
a
piece
in
she
with
awful
scorn
seizing
the
poker
and
thrusting
it
over
his
paper
what
do
you
call
that
sitting
there
telling
your
stories
before
they
crept
out
and
hurried
away
glancing
round
lettie
saw
the
woman
mopping
the
doorstep
after
them
and
she
laughed
he
pulled
his
watch
out
of
his
breeches
pocket
it
was
three
what
are
you
looking
at
the
time
for
she
asked
meg
coming
to
tea
he
replied
she
said
no
more
and
they
walked
slowly
on
when
they
came
on
to
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
and
looked
down
on
to
the
mill
and
the
she
said
i
will
not
come
down
with
will
go
home
not
come
down
to
tea
he
exclaimed
full
of
reproach
and
amazement
why
what
will
they
say
no
i
wo
come
me
say
vale
do
you
remember
how
eurydice
sank
back
into
hell
but
stammered
you
must
come
down
to
can
i
tell
them
why
wo
you
come
she
answered
him
in
latin
with
two
lines
from
virgil
as
she
watched
him
she
pitied
his
helplessness
and
gave
him
a
last
cut
as
she
said
very
softly
and
tenderly
it
would
be
fair
to
meg
he
stood
looking
at
her
his
face
was
coloured
only
by
the
tan
his
eyes
the
dark
eyes
of
the
family
were
darker
than
ever
dilated
with
misery
of
helplessness
and
she
was
infinitely
pitiful
she
wanted
to
cry
in
her
yearning
shall
we
go
into
the
wood
for
a
few
minutes
she
said
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
as
they
turned
aside
the
wood
was
high
and
warm
along
the
ridings
the
were
knee
deep
stretching
glimmering
into
the
distance
like
the
milky
way
through
the
night
they
left
the
tall
paths
to
go
in
among
the
bluebells
breaking
through
the
flowers
and
ferns
till
they
came
to
an
oak
which
had
fallen
across
the
hazels
where
they
sat
half
screened
the
hyacinths
drooped
magnificently
with
an
overweight
of
purple
or
they
stood
pale
and
erect
like
unripe
ears
of
purple
corn
heavy
bees
swung
down
in
a
blunder
of
extravagance
among
the
purple
flowers
they
were
intoxicated
even
with
the
sight
of
so
much
blue
the
sound
of
their
hearty
wanton
humming
came
clear
upon
the
solemn
boom
of
the
wind
overhead
the
sight
of
their
clinging
clambering
riot
gave
satisfaction
to
the
soul
a
rosy
campion
flower
caught
the
sun
and
shone
out
an
elm
sent
down
a
shower
of
sheaths
upon
them
if
there
were
fauns
and
hamadryads
she
said
softly
turning
to
him
to
soothe
his
misery
she
took
his
cap
from
his
head
ruffled
his
hair
saying
if
you
were
a
faun
i
would
put
guelder
roses
round
your
hair
and
make
you
look
bacchanalian
she
left
her
hand
lying
on
his
knee
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
its
blue
looked
pale
and
green
in
comparison
with
the
purple
tide
ebbing
about
the
wood
the
clouds
rose
up
like
towers
and
something
had
touched
them
into
beauty
and
poised
them
up
among
the
winds
the
clouds
passed
on
and
the
pool
of
sky
was
clear
look
she
said
how
we
are
netted
with
knots
of
green
buds
if
we
were
free
on
the
winds
i
glad
we
not
she
turned
suddenly
to
him
and
with
the
same
movement
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
he
clasped
it
in
both
his
i
glad
we
netted
down
here
if
we
were
free
in
the
she
laughed
a
peculiar
little
laugh
catching
her
breath
look
she
said
it
a
palace
with
the
smooth
like
a
girl
arm
and
the
ribbed
and
bossed
and
fretted
with
the
great
steel
shafts
of
beech
all
rising
up
to
hold
an
embroidered
over
us
and
every
thread
of
the
vibrates
with
music
for
us
and
the
little
broidered
birds
sing
and
the
fling
green
spray
round
us
and
the
honeysuckle
leans
down
to
pour
out
scent
over
us
look
at
the
harvest
of
for
us
listen
to
the
bee
sounding
among
all
the
he
sounded
exultant
for
us
she
looked
at
him
with
tears
coming
up
into
her
eyes
and
a
little
winsome
wistful
smile
hovering
round
her
mouth
he
was
very
pale
and
dared
not
look
at
her
she
put
her
hand
in
his
leaning
softly
against
him
he
watched
as
if
fascinated
a
young
thrush
with
full
pale
breast
who
hopped
near
to
look
at
with
quick
shining
eyes
the
clouds
are
going
on
again
said
lettie
look
at
that
cloud
right
up
into
the
sky
the
lips
are
is
telling
us
the
form
is
slipping
we
must
go
too
no
he
cried
do
go
away
her
tenderness
made
her
calm
she
replied
in
a
voice
perfect
in
restrained
sadness
and
resignation
no
my
dear
no
the
threads
of
my
life
were
untwined
they
drifted
about
like
floating
threads
of
gossamer
and
you
did
put
out
your
hand
to
take
them
and
twist
them
up
into
the
chord
with
yours
now
another
has
caught
them
up
and
the
chord
of
my
life
is
being
twisted
and
i
can
not
wrench
it
free
and
untwine
it
ca
i
am
not
strong
enough
besides
you
have
twisted
another
thread
far
and
tight
into
your
chord
could
you
get
free
tell
me
what
to
if
you
tell
me
i
ca
tell
let
me
go
no
lettie
he
pleaded
with
terror
and
humility
no
lettie
go
what
should
i
do
with
my
life
nobody
would
love
you
like
i
what
should
i
do
with
my
love
for
you
it
and
fear
it
because
it
too
much
for
me
she
turned
and
kissed
him
gratefully
he
then
took
her
in
a
long
passionate
embrace
mouth
to
mouth
in
the
end
it
had
so
wearied
her
that
she
could
only
wait
in
his
arms
till
he
was
too
tired
to
hold
her
he
was
trembling
already
poor
meg
she
murmured
to
herself
dully
her
sensations
having
become
vague
he
winced
and
the
pressure
of
his
arms
slackened
she
loosened
his
hands
and
rose
half
dazed
from
her
seat
by
him
she
left
him
while
he
sat
dejected
raising
no
protest
when
i
went
out
to
look
for
them
when
tea
had
already
been
waiting
on
the
table
half
an
hour
or
more
i
found
him
leaning
against
the
gatepost
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
there
was
no
blood
in
his
face
and
his
tan
showed
livid
he
was
haggard
as
if
he
had
been
ill
for
some
weeks
whatever
the
matter
i
said
where
lettie
she
gone
home
he
answered
and
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
and
the
meaning
of
his
own
words
made
him
heave
why
i
asked
in
alarm
he
looked
at
me
as
if
to
say
what
are
you
talking
about
i
can
not
listen
why
i
insisted
i
do
know
he
replied
they
are
waiting
tea
for
you
i
said
he
heard
me
but
took
no
notice
come
on
i
repeated
there
meg
and
everybody
waiting
tea
for
you
i
do
want
any
he
said
i
waited
a
minute
or
two
he
was
violently
sick
vae
meum
fervens
difficile
bile
tumet
jecur
i
thought
to
myself
when
the
sickness
passed
over
he
stood
up
away
from
the
post
trembling
and
lugubrious
his
eyelids
drooped
heavily
over
his
eyes
and
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
a
faint
sick
smile
come
and
lie
down
in
the
loft
i
said
and
i
tell
them
you
got
a
bilious
bout
he
obeyed
me
not
having
energy
to
question
his
strength
had
gone
and
his
splendid
physique
seemed
shrunken
he
walked
weakly
i
looked
away
from
him
for
in
his
feebleness
he
was
already
beginning
to
feel
ludicrous
we
got
into
the
barn
unperceived
and
i
watched
him
climb
the
ladder
to
the
loft
then
i
went
indoors
to
tell
them
i
told
them
lettie
had
promised
to
be
at
highclose
for
tea
that
george
had
a
bilious
attack
and
was
mooning
about
the
barn
till
it
was
over
he
had
been
badly
sick
we
ate
tea
without
zest
or
enjoyment
meg
was
wistful
and
ill
at
ease
the
father
talked
to
her
and
made
much
of
her
the
mother
did
not
care
for
her
much
i
ca
understand
it
said
the
mother
he
so
rarely
has
anything
the
matter
with
i
hardly
known
the
day
are
you
sure
nothing
serious
cyril
it
seems
such
a
just
when
meg
happened
to
be
when
meg
was
about
six
i
had
again
to
go
and
look
for
him
to
satisfy
the
anxiety
of
his
mother
and
his
sweetheart
i
went
whistling
to
let
him
know
i
was
coming
he
lay
on
a
pile
of
hay
in
a
corner
asleep
he
had
put
his
cap
under
his
head
to
stop
the
tickling
of
the
hay
and
he
lay
half
curled
up
sleeping
soundly
he
was
still
very
pale
and
there
was
on
his
face
the
repose
and
pathos
that
a
sorrow
always
leaves
as
he
wore
no
coat
i
was
afraid
he
might
be
chilly
so
i
covered
him
up
with
a
couple
of
sacks
and
i
left
him
i
would
not
have
him
helped
the
father
about
the
cowsheds
and
with
the
pigs
meg
had
to
go
at
seven
she
was
so
disappointed
that
i
said
come
and
have
a
look
at
tell
him
you
did
he
had
thrown
off
the
sacks
and
spread
out
his
limbs
as
he
lay
on
his
back
flung
out
on
the
hay
he
looked
big
again
and
manly
his
mouth
had
relaxed
and
taken
its
old
easy
lines
one
felt
for
him
now
the
warmth
one
feels
for
anyone
who
sleeps
in
an
attitude
of
abandon
she
leaned
over
him
and
looked
at
him
with
a
little
rapture
of
love
and
tenderness
she
longed
to
caress
him
then
he
stretched
himself
and
his
eyes
opened
their
sudden
unclosing
gave
her
a
thrill
he
smiled
sleepily
and
murmured
allo
meg
then
i
saw
him
awake
as
he
remembered
he
turned
with
a
great
sighing
yawn
hid
his
face
again
and
lay
still
come
along
meg
i
whispered
he
be
best
asleep
i
better
cover
him
up
she
said
taking
the
sack
and
laying
it
very
gently
over
his
shoulders
he
kept
perfectly
still
while
i
drew
her
away
chapter
viii
a
poem
of
friendship
the
magnificent
promise
of
spring
was
broken
before
the
was
fully
out
all
through
the
beloved
month
the
wind
rushed
in
upon
us
from
the
north
and
bringing
the
rain
fierce
and
heavy
the
trees
shuddered
and
moaned
when
the
wind
was
dry
the
young
leaves
flapped
limp
the
grass
and
corn
grew
lush
but
the
light
of
the
dandelions
was
quite
extinguished
and
it
seemed
that
only
a
long
time
back
had
we
made
merry
before
the
broad
glare
of
these
flowers
the
bluebells
lingered
and
lingered
they
fringed
the
fields
for
weeks
like
purple
fringe
of
mourning
the
pink
campions
came
out
only
to
hang
heavy
with
rain
hawthorn
buds
remained
tight
and
hard
as
pearls
shrinking
into
the
brilliant
green
foliage
the
the
poor
pleiades
of
the
wood
were
ragged
weeds
often
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
sky
opened
and
stately
clouds
hung
over
the
horizon
infinitely
far
away
glowing
through
the
yellow
distance
with
an
amber
lustre
they
never
came
any
nearer
always
they
remained
far
off
looking
calmly
and
majestically
over
the
shivering
earth
then
saddened
fearing
their
radiance
might
be
dimmed
they
drew
away
and
sank
out
of
sight
sometimes
towards
sunset
a
great
shield
stretched
dark
from
the
west
to
the
zenith
tangling
the
light
along
its
edges
as
the
canopy
rose
higher
it
broke
dispersed
and
the
sky
was
primrose
coloured
high
and
pale
above
the
crystal
moon
then
the
cattle
crouched
among
the
gorse
distressed
by
the
cold
while
the
snipe
flickered
round
high
overhead
round
and
round
in
great
circles
seeming
to
carry
a
serpent
from
its
throat
and
crying
a
tragedy
more
painful
than
the
poignant
lamentations
and
protests
of
the
peewits
following
these
evenings
came
mornings
cold
and
grey
such
a
morning
i
went
up
to
george
on
the
top
fallow
his
father
was
out
with
the
was
alone
as
i
came
up
the
hill
i
could
see
him
standing
in
the
cart
scattering
manure
over
the
bare
red
fields
i
could
hear
his
voice
calling
now
and
then
to
the
mare
and
the
creak
and
clank
of
the
cart
as
it
moved
on
starlings
and
smart
wagtails
were
running
briskly
over
the
clods
and
many
little
birds
flashed
fluttered
hopped
here
and
there
the
lapwings
wheeled
and
cried
as
ever
between
the
low
clouds
and
the
earth
and
some
ran
beautifully
among
the
furrows
too
graceful
and
glistening
for
the
rough
field
i
took
a
fork
and
scattered
the
manure
along
the
hollows
and
thus
we
worked
with
a
wide
field
between
us
yet
very
near
in
the
sense
of
intimacy
i
watched
him
through
the
wheeling
peewits
as
the
low
clouds
went
stealthily
overhead
beneath
us
the
spires
of
the
poplars
in
the
spinney
were
warm
gold
as
if
the
blood
shone
through
further
gleamed
the
grey
water
and
below
it
the
red
roofs
nethermere
was
half
hidden
and
far
away
there
was
nothing
in
this
grey
lonely
world
but
the
peewits
swinging
and
crying
and
george
swinging
silently
at
his
work
the
movement
of
active
life
held
all
my
attention
and
when
i
looked
up
it
was
to
see
the
motion
of
his
limbs
and
his
head
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
rhythmic
body
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
slow
waving
peewits
after
a
while
when
the
cart
was
empty
he
took
a
fork
and
came
towards
me
working
at
my
task
it
began
to
rain
so
he
brought
a
sack
from
the
cart
and
we
crushed
ourselves
under
the
thick
hedge
we
sat
close
together
and
watched
the
rain
fall
like
a
grey
striped
curtain
before
us
hiding
the
valley
we
watched
it
trickle
in
dark
streams
off
the
mare
back
as
she
stood
dejectedly
we
listened
to
the
swish
of
the
drops
falling
all
about
we
felt
the
chill
of
the
rain
and
drew
ourselves
together
in
silence
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
i
lit
a
cigarette
the
rain
continued
all
the
little
pebbles
and
the
red
earth
glistened
in
the
grey
gloom
we
sat
together
speaking
occasionally
it
was
at
these
times
we
formed
the
almost
passionate
attachment
which
later
years
slowly
wore
away
when
the
rain
was
over
we
filled
our
buckets
with
potatoes
and
went
along
the
wet
furrows
sticking
the
spritted
tubers
in
the
cold
ground
being
sandy
the
field
dried
quickly
about
twelve
when
nearly
all
the
potatoes
were
set
he
left
me
and
fetching
up
bob
from
the
far
harnessed
the
mare
and
him
to
the
ridger
to
cover
the
potatoes
the
sharp
light
plough
turned
the
soil
in
a
fine
furrow
over
the
potatoes
hosts
of
little
birds
fluttered
settled
bounded
off
again
after
the
plough
he
called
to
the
horses
and
they
came
downhill
the
white
stars
on
the
two
brown
noses
nodding
up
and
down
george
striding
firm
and
heavy
behind
they
came
down
upon
me
at
a
call
the
horses
turned
shifting
awkwardly
sideways
he
flung
himself
against
the
plough
and
leaning
well
in
brought
it
round
with
a
sweep
a
click
and
they
are
off
uphill
again
there
is
a
great
rustle
as
the
birds
sweep
round
after
him
and
follow
up
the
new
turned
furrow
untackling
the
horses
when
the
rows
were
all
covered
we
tramped
behind
them
down
the
wet
hillside
to
dinner
i
kicked
through
the
drenched
grass
crushing
the
withered
cowslips
under
my
clogs
avoiding
the
purple
orchids
that
were
stunted
with
harsh
upbringing
but
magnificent
in
their
powerful
colouring
crushing
the
pallid
lady
smocks
the
wild
gillivers
i
became
conscious
of
something
near
my
feet
something
little
and
dark
moving
indefinitely
i
had
found
again
the
larkie
nest
i
perceived
the
yellow
beaks
the
bulging
eyelids
of
two
tiny
larks
and
the
blue
lines
of
their
wing
quills
the
indefinite
movement
was
the
swift
rise
and
fall
of
the
brown
fledged
backs
over
which
waved
long
strands
of
fine
down
the
two
little
specks
of
birds
lay
side
by
side
beak
to
beak
their
tiny
bodies
rising
and
falling
in
quick
unison
i
gently
put
down
my
fingers
to
touch
them
they
were
warm
gratifying
to
find
them
warm
in
the
midst
of
so
much
cold
and
wet
i
became
curiously
absorbed
in
them
as
an
eddy
of
wind
stirred
the
strands
of
down
when
one
fledgling
moved
uneasily
shifting
his
soft
ball
i
was
quite
excited
but
he
nestled
down
again
with
his
head
close
to
his
brother
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
longed
for
someone
to
nestle
against
someone
who
would
come
between
me
and
the
coldness
and
wetness
of
the
surroundings
i
envied
the
two
little
miracles
exposed
to
any
tread
yet
so
serene
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
always
wandering
looking
for
something
which
they
had
found
even
before
the
light
broke
into
their
shell
i
was
cold
the
lilacs
in
the
mill
garden
looked
blue
and
perished
i
ran
with
my
heavy
clogs
and
my
heart
heavy
with
vague
longing
down
to
the
mill
while
the
wind
blanched
the
sycamores
and
pushed
the
sullen
pines
rudely
for
the
pines
were
sulking
because
their
million
creamy
sprites
could
not
fly
the
bravely
kept
their
white
candles
erect
in
the
socket
of
every
bough
though
no
sun
came
to
light
them
drearily
a
cold
swan
swept
up
the
water
trailing
its
black
feet
clacking
its
great
hollow
wings
rocking
the
frightened
water
hens
and
insulting
the
staid
geese
what
did
i
want
that
i
turned
thus
from
one
thing
to
another
at
the
end
of
june
the
weather
became
fine
again
hay
harvest
was
to
begin
as
soon
as
it
settled
there
were
only
two
fields
to
be
mown
this
year
to
provide
just
enough
stuff
to
last
until
the
spring
as
my
vacation
had
begun
i
decided
i
would
help
and
that
we
three
the
father
george
and
i
would
get
in
the
hay
without
hired
assistance
i
rose
the
first
morning
very
early
before
the
sun
was
well
up
the
clear
sound
of
challenging
cocks
could
be
heard
along
the
valley
in
the
bottoms
over
the
water
and
over
the
lush
wet
grass
the
night
mist
still
stood
white
and
substantial
as
i
passed
along
the
edge
of
the
meadow
the
was
as
tall
as
i
frothing
up
to
the
top
of
the
hedge
putting
the
faded
hawthorn
to
a
wan
blush
little
early
had
not
heard
the
in
and
out
of
the
foamy
plunging
under
the
surf
of
flowers
washed
high
in
one
corner
swinging
out
again
dashing
past
the
crimson
sorrel
cresset
under
the
froth
of
flowers
were
the
purple
yellow
milk
vetches
and
the
scattered
pink
of
the
and
the
floating
stars
of
marguerites
there
was
a
weight
of
honeysuckle
on
the
hedges
where
pink
roses
were
waking
up
for
their
flight
through
the
day
morning
silvered
the
swaths
of
the
far
meadow
and
swept
in
smooth
brilliant
curves
round
the
stones
of
the
brook
morning
ran
in
my
veins
morning
chased
the
silver
darting
fish
out
of
the
depth
and
i
who
saw
them
snapped
my
fingers
at
them
driving
them
back
i
heard
trip
barking
so
i
ran
towards
the
pond
the
punt
was
at
the
island
where
from
behind
the
bushes
i
could
hear
george
whistling
i
called
to
him
and
he
came
to
the
water
edge
half
dressed
fetch
a
towel
he
called
and
come
on
i
was
back
in
a
few
moments
and
there
stood
my
charon
fluttering
in
the
cool
air
one
good
push
sent
us
to
the
islet
i
made
haste
to
undress
for
he
was
ready
for
the
water
trip
dancing
round
barking
with
excitement
at
his
new
appearance
he
wonders
what
happened
to
me
he
said
laughing
pushing
the
dog
playfully
away
with
his
bare
foot
trip
bounded
back
and
came
leaping
up
licking
him
with
little
caressing
licks
he
began
to
play
with
the
dog
and
directly
they
were
rolling
on
the
fine
turf
the
laughing
expostulating
naked
man
and
the
excited
dog
who
thrust
his
great
head
on
to
the
man
face
licking
and
when
flung
away
rushed
forward
again
snapping
playfully
at
the
naked
arms
and
breasts
at
last
george
lay
back
laughing
and
panting
holding
trip
by
the
two
fore
feet
which
were
planted
on
his
breast
while
the
dog
also
panting
reached
forward
his
head
for
a
flickering
lick
at
the
throat
pressed
back
on
the
grass
and
the
mouth
thrown
back
out
of
reach
when
the
man
had
thus
lain
still
for
a
few
moments
and
the
dog
was
just
laying
his
head
against
his
master
neck
to
rest
too
i
called
and
george
jumped
up
and
plunged
into
the
pond
with
me
trip
after
us
the
water
was
icily
cold
and
for
a
moment
deprived
me
of
my
senses
when
i
began
to
swim
soon
the
water
was
buoyant
and
i
was
sensible
of
nothing
but
the
vigorous
poetry
of
action
i
saw
george
swimming
on
his
back
laughing
at
me
and
in
an
instant
i
had
flung
myself
like
an
impulse
after
him
the
laughing
face
vanished
as
he
swung
over
and
fled
and
i
pursued
the
dark
head
and
the
ruddy
neck
trip
the
wretch
came
paddling
towards
me
interrupting
me
then
all
bewildered
with
excitement
he
scudded
to
the
bank
i
chuckled
to
myself
as
i
saw
him
run
along
then
plunge
in
and
go
plodding
to
george
i
was
gaining
he
tried
to
drive
off
the
dog
and
i
gained
rapidly
as
i
came
up
to
him
and
caught
him
with
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
there
came
a
laughter
from
the
bank
it
was
emily
i
trod
the
water
and
threw
handfuls
of
spray
at
her
she
laughed
and
blushed
then
trip
waded
out
to
her
and
she
fled
swiftly
from
his
george
was
floating
just
beside
me
looking
up
and
laughing
we
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
as
we
rubbed
ourselves
dry
he
was
well
proportioned
and
naturally
of
handsome
physique
heavily
limbed
he
laughed
at
me
telling
me
i
was
like
one
of
aubrey
beardsley
long
lean
ugly
fellows
i
referred
him
to
many
classic
examples
of
slenderness
declaring
myself
more
exquisite
than
his
grossness
which
amused
him
but
i
had
to
give
in
and
bow
to
him
and
he
took
on
an
indulgent
gentle
manner
i
laughed
and
submitted
for
he
knew
how
i
admired
the
noble
white
fruitfulness
of
his
form
as
i
watched
him
he
stood
in
white
relief
against
the
mass
of
green
he
polished
his
arm
holding
it
out
straight
and
solid
he
rubbed
his
hair
into
curls
while
i
watched
the
deep
muscles
of
his
shoulders
and
the
bands
stand
out
in
his
neck
as
he
held
it
firm
i
remembered
the
story
of
annable
he
saw
i
had
forgotten
to
continue
my
rubbing
and
laughing
he
took
hold
of
me
and
began
to
rub
me
briskly
as
if
i
were
a
child
or
rather
a
woman
he
loved
and
did
not
fear
i
left
myself
quite
limply
in
his
hands
and
to
get
a
better
grip
of
me
he
put
his
arm
round
me
and
pressed
me
against
him
and
the
sweetness
of
the
touch
of
our
naked
bodies
one
against
the
other
was
superb
it
satisfied
in
some
measure
the
vague
indecipherable
yearning
of
my
soul
and
it
was
the
same
with
him
when
he
had
rubbed
me
all
warm
he
let
me
go
and
we
looked
at
each
other
with
eyes
of
still
laughter
and
our
love
was
perfect
for
a
moment
more
perfect
than
any
love
i
have
known
since
either
for
man
or
woman
we
went
together
down
to
the
fields
he
to
mow
the
island
of
grass
he
had
left
standing
the
previous
evening
i
to
sharpen
the
machine
knife
to
mow
out
the
with
the
scythe
and
to
rake
the
swaths
from
the
way
of
the
machine
when
the
unmown
grass
was
reduced
to
a
triangle
the
cool
moist
fragrance
of
the
morning
the
intentional
stillness
of
everything
of
the
tall
bluish
trees
of
the
wet
frank
flowers
of
the
trustful
moths
folded
and
unfolded
in
the
fallen
swaths
was
a
perfect
medium
of
sympathy
the
horses
moved
with
a
still
dignity
obeying
his
commands
when
they
were
harnessed
and
the
machine
oiled
still
he
was
loth
to
mar
the
perfect
morning
but
stood
looking
down
the
valley
i
sha
mow
these
fields
any
more
he
said
and
the
fallen
silvered
swaths
flickered
back
his
regret
and
the
faint
scent
of
the
limes
was
wistful
so
much
of
the
field
was
cut
so
much
remained
to
cut
then
it
was
ended
this
year
the
elder
flowers
were
widespread
over
the
corner
bushes
and
the
pink
roses
fluttered
high
above
the
hedge
there
were
the
same
flowers
in
the
grass
as
we
had
known
many
years
we
should
not
know
them
any
more
but
merely
to
have
mown
them
is
worth
having
lived
for
he
said
looking
at
me
we
felt
the
warmth
of
the
sun
trickling
through
the
morning
mist
of
coolness
you
see
that
sycamore
he
said
that
bushy
one
beyond
the
big
willow
i
remember
when
father
broke
off
the
leading
shoot
because
he
wanted
a
fine
straight
stick
i
can
remember
i
felt
sorry
it
was
running
up
so
straight
with
such
a
fine
balance
of
know
how
a
young
strong
sycamore
looks
about
nine
feet
seemed
a
cruelty
when
you
are
gone
and
we
are
left
from
here
i
shall
feel
like
that
as
if
my
leading
shoot
were
broken
off
you
see
the
tree
is
spoiled
yet
how
it
went
on
growing
i
believe
i
shall
grow
faster
i
can
remember
the
bright
red
stalks
of
the
leaves
as
he
broke
them
off
from
the
bough
he
smiled
at
me
half
proud
of
his
speech
then
he
swung
into
the
seat
of
the
machine
having
attended
to
the
horses
heads
he
lifted
the
knife
he
said
smiling
whimsically
back
at
me
the
machine
started
the
bed
of
the
knife
fell
and
the
grass
shivered
and
dropped
over
i
watched
the
heads
of
the
daisies
and
the
splendid
lines
of
the
cocksfool
grass
quiver
shake
against
the
crimson
burnet
and
the
machine
went
singing
down
the
field
leaving
a
track
of
smooth
velvet
green
in
the
way
of
the
the
flowers
in
the
wall
of
uncut
grass
waited
unmoved
as
the
days
wait
for
us
the
sun
caught
in
the
uplicking
scarlet
sorrel
flames
the
butterflies
woke
and
i
could
hear
the
fine
ring
of
his
whoa
from
the
far
corner
then
he
turned
and
i
could
see
only
the
tossing
ears
of
the
horses
and
the
white
of
his
shoulder
as
they
moved
along
the
wall
of
high
grass
on
the
hill
slope
i
sat
down
under
the
elm
to
file
the
sections
of
the
knife
always
as
he
rode
he
watched
the
falling
swath
only
occasionally
calling
the
horses
into
line
it
was
his
voice
which
rang
the
morning
awake
when
we
were
at
work
we
hardly
noticed
one
another
yet
his
mother
had
said
george
is
so
glad
when
you
in
the
does
care
how
long
the
day
is
later
when
the
morning
was
hot
and
the
honeysuckle
had
ceased
to
breathe
and
all
the
other
scents
were
moving
in
the
air
about
us
when
all
the
field
was
down
when
i
had
seen
the
last
trembling
ecstasy
of
the
harebells
trembling
to
fall
when
the
thick
clump
of
purple
vetch
had
sunk
when
the
green
swaths
were
settling
and
the
silver
swaths
were
glistening
and
glittering
as
the
sun
came
along
them
in
the
hot
ripe
morning
we
worked
together
turning
the
hay
tipping
over
the
yesterday
swaths
with
our
forks
and
bringing
yesterday
fresh
hidden
flowers
into
the
death
of
sunlight
it
was
then
that
we
talked
of
the
past
and
speculated
on
the
future
as
the
day
grew
older
and
less
wistful
we
forgot
everything
and
worked
on
singing
and
sometimes
i
would
recite
him
verses
as
we
went
and
sometimes
i
would
tell
him
about
books
life
was
full
of
glamour
for
us
both
chapter
ix
pastorals
and
peonies
at
dinner
time
the
father
announced
to
us
the
exciting
fact
that
leslie
had
asked
if
a
few
of
his
guests
might
picnic
that
afternoon
in
the
strelley
hayfields
the
closes
were
so
beautiful
with
the
brook
under
all
its
sheltering
trees
running
into
the
pond
that
was
set
with
two
green
islets
moreover
the
squire
lady
had
written
a
book
filling
these
meadows
and
the
mill
precincts
with
romance
the
wedding
guests
at
highclose
were
anxious
to
picnic
in
so
choice
a
spot
the
father
who
delighted
in
a
gay
throng
beamed
at
us
from
over
the
table
george
asked
who
were
coming
oh
not
half
a
ladies
down
for
the
wedding
george
at
first
swore
warmly
then
he
began
to
appreciate
the
affair
as
a
joke
saxton
hoped
they
would
want
her
to
provide
them
pots
for
she
had
two
cups
that
matched
nor
had
any
of
her
spoons
the
least
pretence
to
silver
the
children
were
hugely
excited
and
wanted
a
holiday
from
school
which
emily
at
once
vetoed
firmly
thereby
causing
family
dissension
as
we
went
round
the
field
in
the
afternoon
turning
the
hay
we
were
thinking
apart
and
did
not
talk
every
now
and
at
every
stopped
to
look
down
towards
the
wood
to
see
if
they
were
coming
here
they
are
george
exclaimed
suddenly
having
spied
the
movement
of
white
in
the
dark
wood
we
stood
still
and
watched
two
girls
heliotrope
and
white
a
man
with
two
girls
pale
green
and
white
and
a
man
with
a
girl
last
can
you
tell
who
they
are
i
asked
that
marie
tempest
that
first
girl
in
white
and
that
him
and
lettie
at
the
back
i
do
know
any
more
he
stood
perfectly
still
until
they
had
gone
out
of
sight
behind
the
banks
down
by
the
brooks
then
he
stuck
his
fork
in
the
ground
saying
you
can
easily
you
like
i
go
and
mow
out
that
bottom
corner
he
glanced
at
me
to
see
what
i
was
thinking
of
him
i
was
thinking
that
he
was
afraid
to
meet
her
and
i
was
smiling
to
myself
perhaps
he
felt
ashamed
for
he
went
silently
away
to
the
machine
where
he
belted
his
riding
breeches
tightly
round
his
waist
and
slung
the
scythe
strap
on
his
hip
i
heard
the
clanging
slur
of
the
scythe
stone
as
he
whetted
the
blade
then
he
strode
off
to
mow
the
far
bottom
corner
where
the
ground
was
marshy
and
the
machine
might
not
go
to
bring
down
the
lush
green
grass
and
the
tall
meadow
sweet
i
went
to
the
pond
to
meet
the
newcomers
i
bowed
to
louie
denys
a
tall
graceful
girl
of
the
drooping
type
elaborately
gowned
in
heliotrope
linen
i
bowed
to
agnes
an
erect
intelligent
girl
with
magnificent
auburn
wore
no
hat
and
carried
a
sunshade
i
bowed
to
hilda
seconde
a
svelte
petite
girl
exquisitely
and
delicately
pretty
i
bowed
to
maria
and
to
lettie
and
i
shook
hands
with
leslie
and
with
his
friend
freddy
cresswell
the
latter
was
to
be
best
man
a
broad
shouldered
fellow
with
beautiful
soft
hair
like
red
wheat
and
laughing
eyes
and
a
whimsical
drawling
manner
of
speech
like
a
man
who
has
suffered
enough
to
bring
him
to
manhood
and
maturity
but
who
in
spite
of
all
remains
a
boy
irresponsible
trifle
pathetic
as
the
day
was
very
hot
both
men
were
in
flannels
and
wore
flannel
collars
yet
it
was
evident
that
they
had
dressed
with
scrupulous
care
instinctively
i
tried
to
pull
my
trousers
into
shape
within
my
belt
and
i
felt
the
inferiority
cast
upon
the
father
big
and
fine
as
he
was
in
his
way
for
his
shoulders
were
rounded
with
work
and
his
trousers
were
much
distorted
what
can
we
do
said
marie
you
know
we
do
want
to
hinder
we
want
to
help
you
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
let
us
come
the
father
laughed
his
fine
indulgence
saying
to
loved
him
for
the
mellow
laughing
modulation
of
his
voice
come
on
see
there
a
bit
of
to
do
as
left
come
and
pick
your
forks
from
among
a
sheaf
of
hayforks
he
chose
the
lightest
for
them
and
they
began
anywhere
just
tipping
at
the
swaths
he
showed
them
and
the
charming
little
how
to
do
it
but
they
found
the
right
way
the
hardest
way
so
they
worked
in
their
own
fashion
and
laughed
heartily
with
him
when
he
made
playful
jokes
at
them
he
was
a
great
lover
of
girls
and
they
blossomed
from
timidity
under
his
hearty
influence
ain
it
flippin
drawled
cresswell
who
had
just
taken
his
degree
in
classics
this
bloomin
stuff
dry
an
flop
on
it
he
gathered
a
cushion
of
hay
which
louie
denys
carefully
appropriated
arranging
first
her
beautiful
dress
that
fitted
close
to
her
shape
without
any
belt
or
interruption
and
then
laying
her
arms
that
were
netted
to
the
shoulder
in
open
lace
gracefully
at
rest
lettie
who
was
also
in
a
closefitting
white
dress
which
showed
her
shape
down
to
the
hips
sat
where
leslie
had
prepared
for
her
and
miss
reluctantly
accepted
my
pile
cresswell
twisted
his
mouth
in
a
little
smile
saying
lord
a
giddy
little
for
old
theocritus
ai
it
miss
denys
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
those
classic
dare
even
say
their
names
what
would
he
say
about
us
he
laughed
winking
his
blue
eyes
he
make
old
daphnis
there
to
sing
a
match
with
me
the
merits
of
our
various
daphnis
sing
up
for
amaryllis
i
mean
nais
damn
they
were
for
ever
getting
mixed
up
with
their
nymphs
i
say
cresswell
your
language
consider
whom
you
damning
said
miss
denys
leaning
over
and
tapping
his
head
with
her
silk
glove
you
say
any
giddy
thing
in
a
pastoral
he
replied
taking
the
edge
of
her
skirt
and
lying
back
on
it
looking
up
at
her
as
she
leaned
over
him
strike
up
daphnis
something
about
honey
or
white
else
the
early
apples
that
be
ripe
in
a
week
time
i
sure
the
apples
you
showed
me
are
ever
so
little
and
green
interrupted
miss
denys
they
will
never
be
ripe
in
a
sour
he
smiled
up
at
her
in
his
whimsical
way
hear
that
sour
much
oh
love
us
have
you
got
a
start
yet
there
aught
to
sing
about
you
kid
i
hear
you
no
judge
of
honey
and
cheese
an
darn
little
a
woman
to
judge
them
do
it
miss
denys
i
do
know
she
said
stroking
his
soft
hair
from
his
forehead
with
her
hand
whereon
rings
were
sparkling
love
is
not
white
my
hair
is
not
yellow
like
honey
dropping
through
the
love
is
brown
and
sweet
and
ready
for
the
lips
of
love
go
on
up
old
cowherd
who
that
tuning
his
pipe
that
fellow
sharpening
his
scythe
it
enough
to
make
your
backache
to
look
at
him
an
stop
him
somebody
yes
let
us
go
and
fetch
him
said
miss
i
sure
he
know
what
a
happy
pastoral
state
he
us
go
and
fetch
him
they
do
like
hindering
at
their
work
where
ignorance
is
said
lettie
afraid
lest
she
might
bring
him
the
other
hesitated
then
with
her
eyes
she
invited
me
to
go
with
her
oh
dear
she
laughed
with
a
little
mowe
freddy
is
such
an
ass
and
louie
denys
is
like
a
wasp
at
treacle
i
wanted
to
laugh
yet
i
felt
just
a
tiny
bit
cross
do
you
feel
great
when
you
go
mowing
like
that
father
timey
sort
of
feeling
shall
we
go
and
look
we
say
we
want
those
foxgloves
he
be
cutting
down
those
bell
flowers
i
suppose
you
need
go
on
with
your
he
did
not
know
we
were
approaching
till
i
called
him
then
he
started
slightly
as
he
saw
the
tall
proud
girl
i
said
and
he
shook
hands
with
her
immediately
his
manner
became
ironic
for
he
had
seen
his
hand
big
and
coarse
and
inflamed
with
the
snaith
clasping
the
lady
hand
we
thought
you
looked
so
fine
she
said
to
him
and
men
are
so
embarrassing
when
they
make
love
to
somebody
they
save
us
those
foxgloves
will
are
savage
soldiers
drawn
up
against
the
cut
them
those
ah
yes
they
are
spinning
idylls
up
there
i
do
care
for
idylls
do
you
oh
you
do
know
what
a
classical
pastoral
person
you
there
i
do
suppose
you
suffer
from
idyllic
she
laughed
does
see
the
silly
little
god
fluttering
about
in
our
hayfields
does
one
do
you
find
much
time
to
sport
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
sure
it
a
shame
they
banished
phyllis
from
the
he
laughed
and
went
on
with
his
work
she
smiled
a
little
too
thinking
she
had
made
a
great
impression
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
dramatic
gesture
and
looked
at
me
when
the
scythe
crunched
through
the
crunch
is
it
fine
she
exclaimed
a
kind
of
inevitable
think
it
fine
we
wandered
about
picking
flowers
and
talking
until
teatime
a
manservant
came
with
the
and
the
girls
spread
the
cloth
under
a
great
willow
tree
lettie
took
the
little
silver
kettle
and
went
to
fill
it
at
the
small
spring
which
trickled
into
a
stone
trough
all
pretty
with
cranesbill
and
stellaria
hanging
over
while
long
blades
of
grass
waved
in
the
water
george
who
had
finished
his
work
and
wanted
to
go
home
to
tea
walked
across
to
the
spring
where
lettie
sat
playing
with
the
water
getting
little
cupfuls
to
put
into
the
kettle
watching
the
quick
skating
of
the
water
beetles
and
the
large
faint
spots
of
their
shadows
darting
on
the
silted
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
trough
she
glanced
round
on
hearing
him
coming
and
smiled
nervously
they
were
mutually
afraid
of
meeting
each
other
again
it
is
about
teatime
he
said
will
be
ready
in
a
is
not
to
make
the
tea
only
to
keep
a
little
supply
of
hot
water
oh
he
said
i
go
on
rather
no
she
replied
you
ca
because
we
are
all
having
tea
together
i
had
some
fruits
put
up
because
i
know
you
do
trifle
with
your
father
coming
but
he
replied
pettishly
i
ca
have
my
tea
with
all
those
do
want
at
me
he
held
out
his
inflamed
barbaric
hands
she
winced
and
said
it
wo
give
the
realistic
touch
he
laughed
ironically
must
come
she
insisted
i
have
a
drink
then
if
you
let
me
he
said
yielding
she
got
up
quickly
blushing
offering
him
the
tiny
pretty
cup
i
awfully
sorry
she
said
never
mind
he
muttered
and
turning
from
the
proffered
cup
he
lay
down
flat
put
his
mouth
to
the
water
and
drank
deeply
she
stood
and
watched
the
motion
of
his
drinking
and
of
his
heavy
breathing
afterwards
he
got
up
wiping
his
mouth
not
looking
at
her
then
he
washed
his
hands
in
the
water
and
stirred
up
the
mud
he
put
his
hand
to
the
bottom
of
the
trough
bringing
out
a
handful
of
silt
with
the
grey
shrimps
twisting
in
it
he
flung
the
mud
on
the
floor
where
the
poor
grey
creatures
writhed
it
wants
cleaning
out
he
said
yes
she
replied
shuddering
you
wo
be
long
she
added
taking
up
the
silver
kettle
in
a
few
moments
he
got
up
and
followed
her
reluctantly
down
he
was
nervous
and
irritable
the
girls
were
seated
on
tufts
of
hay
with
the
men
leaning
in
attendance
on
them
and
the
manservant
waiting
on
all
george
was
placed
between
lettie
and
hilda
the
former
handed
him
his
little
of
tea
which
as
he
was
not
very
thirsty
he
put
down
on
the
ground
beside
him
then
she
passed
him
the
bread
and
butter
cut
for
tea
and
fruits
grapes
and
peaches
and
strawberries
in
a
beautifully
carved
oak
tray
she
watched
for
a
moment
his
thick
fingers
fumbling
over
the
fruits
then
she
turned
her
head
away
all
the
gay
teatime
when
the
talk
bubbled
and
frothed
over
all
the
cups
she
avoided
him
with
her
eyes
yet
again
and
again
as
someone
said
sorry
you
have
some
cake
see
this
peach
i
sure
it
will
be
mellow
right
to
the
stone
very
naturally
but
making
the
distinction
between
him
and
the
other
men
by
their
indulgence
towards
him
lettie
was
forced
to
glance
at
him
as
he
sat
eating
answering
in
monosyllables
laughing
with
constraint
and
awkwardness
and
her
irritation
flickered
between
her
brows
although
she
kept
up
the
gay
frivolity
of
the
conversation
still
the
discord
was
felt
by
everybody
and
we
did
not
linger
as
we
should
have
done
over
the
cups
george
they
said
afterwards
was
a
wet
blanket
on
the
party
lettie
was
intensely
annoyed
with
him
his
presence
was
unbearable
to
her
she
wished
him
a
thousand
miles
away
he
sat
listening
to
cresswell
whimsical
affectation
of
vulgarity
which
flickered
with
fantasy
and
he
laughed
in
a
strained
fashion
he
was
the
first
to
rise
saying
he
must
get
the
cows
up
for
milking
oh
let
us
us
go
may
we
come
and
see
the
cows
milked
said
hilda
her
delicate
exquisite
features
flushing
for
she
was
very
shy
no
drawled
freddy
the
stink
o
live
beef
ai
salubrious
you
be
warned
and
stop
here
i
never
could
bear
cows
except
those
lovely
little
highland
cattle
all
woolly
in
pictures
said
louie
denys
smiling
archly
with
a
little
irony
no
laughed
agnes
smelly
she
pursed
up
her
mouth
and
ended
in
a
little
trill
of
deprecatory
laughter
as
she
often
did
hilda
looked
from
one
to
the
other
blushing
come
lettie
said
leslie
i
know
you
have
a
farmyard
on
and
they
followed
george
down
as
they
passed
along
the
pond
bank
a
swan
and
her
tawny
fluffy
brood
sailed
with
them
the
length
of
the
water
tipping
on
their
little
toes
the
through
the
water
tiny
little
things
as
marie
said
we
heard
george
below
calling
then
a
moment
or
two
after
in
the
bottom
garden
come
out
you
little
you
coming
out
of
it
in
manifestly
angry
tones
has
it
run
away
laughed
hilda
delighted
and
we
hastened
out
of
the
lower
garden
to
see
there
in
the
green
shade
between
the
tall
gooseberry
bushes
the
heavy
crimson
peonies
stood
gorgeously
along
the
path
the
full
red
globes
poised
and
leaning
voluptuously
sank
their
crimson
weight
on
to
the
seeding
grass
of
the
path
borne
down
by
secret
rain
and
by
their
own
splendour
the
path
was
poured
over
with
red
rich
silk
of
strewn
petals
the
great
flowers
swung
their
crimson
grandly
about
the
walk
like
crowds
of
cardinals
in
pomp
among
the
green
bushes
we
burst
into
the
new
world
of
delight
as
lettie
stooped
taking
between
both
hands
the
gorgeous
silken
fulness
of
one
blossom
that
was
sunk
to
the
earth
george
came
down
the
path
with
the
brown
straddling
behind
him
its
neck
stuck
out
sucking
zealously
at
his
middle
finger
the
unconscious
attitudes
of
the
girls
all
bent
enraptured
over
the
peonies
touched
him
with
sudden
pain
as
he
came
up
with
the
calf
stalking
grudgingly
behind
he
said
there
a
fine
show
of
pyeenocks
this
year
is
there
what
do
you
call
them
cried
hilda
turning
to
him
her
sweet
charming
face
full
of
interest
pyeenocks
he
replied
lettie
remained
crouching
with
a
red
flower
between
her
hands
glancing
sideways
unseen
to
look
at
the
calf
which
with
its
shiny
nose
uplifted
was
mumbling
in
its
sticky
gums
the
seductive
finger
it
sucked
eagerly
but
unprofitably
and
it
appeared
to
cast
a
troubled
eye
inwards
to
see
if
it
were
really
receiving
any
satisfaction
but
not
despairing
marie
and
hilda
and
leslie
laughed
while
he
after
looking
at
lettie
as
she
crouched
wistfully
as
he
thought
over
the
flower
led
the
little
brute
out
of
the
garden
and
sent
it
running
into
the
yard
with
a
smack
on
the
haunch
then
he
returned
rubbing
his
sticky
finger
dry
against
his
breeches
he
stood
near
to
lettie
and
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
extraordinary
pale
cleanness
of
the
one
finger
among
the
others
she
rubbed
her
finger
against
her
dress
in
painful
sympathy
but
are
the
flowers
lovely
exclaimed
marie
again
i
want
to
hug
them
oh
yes
assented
hilda
they
are
like
a
romance
in
passionate
sadness
said
lettie
in
an
ironical
voice
speaking
half
out
of
conventional
necessity
of
saying
something
half
out
of
desire
to
shield
herself
and
yet
in
a
measure
express
herself
there
is
a
tale
about
them
i
said
the
girls
clamoured
for
the
legend
pray
do
tell
us
pleaded
hilda
the
irresistible
it
was
emily
told
says
it
a
legend
but
i
believe
it
only
a
tale
she
says
the
peonies
were
brought
from
the
hall
long
since
by
a
fellow
of
this
it
was
a
mill
he
was
brown
and
strong
and
the
daughter
of
the
hall
who
was
pale
and
fragile
and
young
loved
him
when
he
went
up
to
the
hall
gardens
to
cut
the
yew
hedges
she
would
hover
round
him
in
her
white
frock
and
tell
him
tales
of
old
days
in
little
snatches
like
a
wren
singing
till
he
thought
she
was
a
fairy
who
had
bewitched
him
he
would
stand
and
watch
her
and
one
day
when
she
came
near
to
him
telling
him
a
tale
that
set
the
tears
swimming
in
her
eyes
he
took
hold
of
her
and
kissed
her
and
kept
her
they
used
to
tryst
in
the
poplar
spinney
she
would
come
with
her
arms
full
of
flowers
for
she
always
kept
to
her
fairy
part
one
morning
she
came
early
through
the
mists
he
was
out
shooting
she
wanted
to
take
him
unawares
like
a
fairy
her
arms
were
full
of
peonies
when
she
was
moving
beyond
the
trees
he
shot
her
not
knowing
she
stumbled
on
and
sank
down
in
their
tryst
place
he
found
her
lying
there
among
the
red
pyeenocks
white
and
fallen
he
thought
she
was
just
lying
talking
to
the
red
flowers
so
he
stood
waiting
then
he
went
up
and
bent
over
her
and
found
the
flowers
full
of
blood
it
was
he
set
the
garden
here
with
these
pyeenocks
the
eyes
of
the
girls
were
round
with
the
pity
of
the
tale
and
hilda
turned
away
to
hide
her
tears
it
is
a
beautiful
ending
said
lettie
in
a
low
tone
looking
at
the
floor
it
all
a
tale
said
leslie
soothing
the
girls
george
waited
till
lettie
looked
at
him
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
at
last
then
each
turned
aside
trembling
marie
asked
for
some
of
the
peonies
give
me
just
a
i
can
tell
the
others
the
is
so
feel
so
sorry
for
him
it
was
so
cruel
for
and
lettie
says
it
ends
george
cut
the
flowers
with
his
great
clasp
knife
and
marie
took
them
carefully
treating
their
romance
with
great
tenderness
then
all
went
out
of
the
garden
and
he
turned
to
the
cowshed
for
the
present
said
lettie
afraid
to
stay
near
him
he
laughed
thank
you
much
for
the
the
was
splendid
said
marie
so
sad
then
they
went
and
we
did
not
see
them
again
later
when
all
had
gone
to
bed
at
the
mill
george
and
i
sat
together
on
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
smoking
saying
little
he
was
casting
up
the
total
of
discrepancies
and
now
and
again
he
ejaculated
one
of
his
thoughts
and
all
day
he
said
blench
has
been
ploughing
his
wheat
in
because
it
was
that
bitten
off
by
the
rabbits
it
was
no
manner
of
use
so
ploughed
it
in
an
they
say
with
idylls
eating
peaches
in
our
close
then
there
was
silence
while
the
clock
throbbed
heavily
and
outside
a
wild
bird
called
and
was
still
softly
the
ashes
rustled
lower
in
the
grate
she
said
it
ended
what
the
good
of
the
good
of
that
he
turned
his
face
to
the
ashes
in
the
grate
and
sat
brooding
outside
among
the
trees
some
wild
animal
set
up
a
thin
wailing
cry
damn
that
row
said
i
stirring
looking
also
into
the
grey
fire
it
some
stoat
or
weasel
or
something
it
been
going
on
like
that
for
nearly
a
week
i
shot
in
the
trees
ever
so
many
times
there
were
gone
continuously
through
the
heavy
chilling
silence
came
the
miserable
crying
from
the
darkness
among
the
trees
you
know
he
said
she
hated
me
this
afternoon
and
i
hated
it
was
midnight
full
of
sick
thoughts
it
is
no
good
said
i
go
to
will
be
morning
in
a
few
hours
part
iii
chapter
i
a
new
start
in
life
lettie
was
wedded
as
i
had
said
before
leslie
lost
all
the
wistful
traces
of
his
illness
they
had
been
gone
away
to
france
five
days
before
we
recovered
anything
like
the
normal
tone
in
the
house
then
though
the
routine
was
the
same
everywhere
was
a
sense
of
loss
and
of
change
the
long
voyage
in
the
quiet
home
was
over
we
had
crossed
the
bright
sea
of
our
youth
and
already
lettie
had
landed
and
was
travelling
to
a
strange
destination
in
a
foreign
land
it
was
time
for
us
all
to
go
to
leave
the
valley
of
nethermere
whose
waters
and
whose
woods
were
distilled
in
the
essence
of
our
veins
we
were
the
children
of
the
valley
of
nethermere
a
small
nation
with
language
and
blood
of
our
own
and
to
cast
ourselves
each
one
into
separate
exile
was
painful
to
us
i
shall
have
to
go
now
said
george
it
is
my
nature
to
linger
an
unconscionable
time
yet
i
dread
above
all
things
this
slow
crumbling
away
from
my
foundations
by
which
i
free
myself
at
last
i
must
wrench
myself
away
it
was
the
slack
time
between
the
hay
and
the
corn
harvest
and
we
sat
together
in
the
grey
still
morning
of
august
pulling
the
stack
my
hands
were
sore
with
tugging
the
loose
wisps
from
the
lower
part
of
the
stack
so
i
waited
for
the
touch
of
rain
to
send
us
indoors
it
came
at
last
and
we
hurried
into
the
barn
we
climbed
the
ladder
into
the
loft
that
was
strewn
with
farming
implements
and
with
carpenters
tools
we
sat
together
on
the
shavings
that
littered
the
bench
before
the
high
gable
window
and
looked
out
over
the
brooks
and
the
woods
and
the
ponds
the
were
very
near
to
us
and
we
felt
ourselves
the
centre
of
the
waters
and
the
woods
that
spread
down
the
rainy
valley
in
a
few
years
i
said
we
shall
be
almost
strangers
he
looked
at
me
with
fond
dark
eyes
and
smiled
incredulously
it
is
as
far
said
i
to
the
as
it
is
for
me
to
do
you
want
me
to
go
there
he
asked
smiling
quietly
it
all
as
one
where
you
go
you
will
travel
north
and
i
east
and
lettie
south
lettie
has
departed
in
seven
weeks
i
you
i
must
be
gone
before
you
he
said
decisively
do
you
and
he
smiled
timidly
in
confession
i
feel
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
being
left
alone
on
a
loose
end
i
must
not
be
the
last
to
he
added
almost
appealingly
and
you
will
go
to
meg
i
asked
he
sat
tearing
the
silken
shavings
into
shreds
and
telling
me
in
clumsy
fragments
all
he
could
of
his
feelings
you
see
it
not
so
much
what
you
call
love
i
do
know
you
see
i
built
on
lettie
looked
up
at
me
shamefacedly
then
continued
tearing
the
you
must
found
your
castles
on
something
and
i
founded
mine
on
lettie
you
see
i
like
plenty
of
folks
i
have
nothing
definite
to
shape
my
life
to
i
put
brick
upon
brick
as
they
come
and
if
the
whole
topples
down
in
the
end
it
does
but
you
see
you
and
lettie
have
made
me
conscious
and
now
i
at
a
dead
loss
i
have
looked
to
marriage
to
set
me
busy
on
my
house
of
life
something
whole
and
complete
of
which
it
will
supply
the
design
i
must
marry
or
be
in
a
lost
lane
there
are
two
people
i
could
gone
i
love
meg
just
as
well
as
far
as
love
goes
i
not
sure
i
feel
better
pleased
at
the
idea
of
marrying
her
you
know
i
should
always
have
been
second
to
lettie
and
the
best
part
of
love
is
being
made
much
of
being
first
and
foremost
in
the
whole
world
for
somebody
and
meg
easy
and
lovely
i
can
have
her
without
trembling
she
full
of
soothing
and
comfort
i
can
stroke
her
hair
and
pet
her
and
she
looks
up
at
me
full
of
trust
and
lovingness
and
there
is
no
flaw
all
restfulness
in
one
three
weeks
later
as
i
lay
in
the
august
sunshine
in
a
on
the
lawn
i
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
along
the
gravel
path
it
was
george
calling
for
me
to
accompany
him
to
his
marriage
he
pulled
up
the
near
the
door
and
came
up
the
steps
to
me
on
the
lawn
he
was
dressed
as
if
for
the
cattle
market
in
jacket
and
breeches
and
gaiters
well
are
you
ready
he
said
standing
smiling
down
on
me
his
eyes
were
dark
with
excitement
and
had
that
vulnerable
look
which
was
so
peculiar
to
the
saxtons
in
their
emotional
moments
you
are
in
good
time
said
i
it
is
but
half
past
nine
it
would
do
to
be
late
on
a
day
like
this
he
said
gaily
see
how
the
sun
shines
come
you
do
look
as
brisk
as
a
best
man
should
i
thought
you
would
have
been
on
tenterhooks
of
excitement
get
up
get
up
look
here
a
bird
has
given
me
luck
showed
me
a
white
smear
on
his
shoulder
i
drew
myself
up
lazily
all
right
i
said
but
we
must
drink
a
whisky
to
establish
it
he
followed
me
out
of
the
fragrant
sunshine
into
the
dark
house
the
rooms
were
very
still
and
empty
but
the
cool
silence
responded
at
once
to
the
gaiety
of
our
sunwarm
entrance
the
sweetness
of
the
summer
morning
hung
invisible
like
glad
ghosts
of
romance
through
the
shadowy
room
we
seemed
to
feel
the
sunlight
dancing
golden
in
our
veins
as
we
filled
again
the
pale
liqueur
joy
to
envy
you
his
teeth
were
white
and
his
eyes
stirred
like
dark
liquor
as
he
smiled
here
is
my
wedding
present
i
stood
the
four
large
along
the
wall
before
him
they
were
drawings
among
the
waters
and
the
fields
of
the
mill
grey
rain
and
twilight
morning
with
the
sun
pouring
gold
into
the
mist
and
the
suspense
of
a
midsummer
noon
upon
the
pond
all
the
glamour
of
our
yesterdays
came
over
him
like
an
intoxicant
and
he
quivered
with
the
wonderful
beauty
of
life
that
was
weaving
him
into
the
large
magic
of
the
years
he
realised
the
splendour
of
the
pageant
of
days
which
had
him
in
train
it
been
wonderful
cyril
all
the
time
he
said
with
surprised
joy
we
drove
away
through
the
freshness
of
the
wood
and
among
the
flowing
of
the
sunshine
along
the
road
the
cottages
of
greymede
filled
the
shadows
with
colour
of
roses
and
the
sunlight
with
odour
of
pinks
and
the
blue
of
corn
flowers
and
larkspur
we
drove
briskly
up
the
long
sleeping
hill
and
bowled
down
the
hollow
past
the
farms
where
the
hens
were
walking
with
the
red
gold
cocks
in
the
orchard
and
the
ducks
like
white
cloudlets
under
the
aspen
trees
revelled
on
the
pond
i
told
her
to
be
ready
any
time
said
but
she
does
know
it
i
did
want
the
full
of
the
business
the
mare
walked
up
the
sharp
little
rise
on
top
of
which
stood
the
ram
inn
in
the
quiet
as
the
horse
slowed
to
a
standstill
we
heard
the
crooning
of
a
song
in
the
garden
we
sat
still
in
the
cart
and
looked
across
the
flagged
yard
to
where
the
tall
madonna
lilies
rose
in
clusters
out
of
the
alyssome
beyond
the
border
of
flowers
was
meg
bending
over
the
gooseberry
bushes
she
saw
us
and
came
swinging
down
the
path
with
a
bowl
of
gooseberries
poised
on
her
hip
she
was
dressed
in
a
plain
fresh
holland
frock
with
a
white
apron
her
black
heavy
hair
reflected
the
sunlight
and
her
ripe
face
was
luxuriant
with
laughter
well
i
never
she
exclaimed
trying
not
to
show
that
she
guessed
his
errand
fancy
you
here
at
this
time
o
morning
her
eyes
delightful
black
eyes
like
polished
jet
untroubled
and
frank
looked
at
us
as
a
robin
might
with
bright
questioning
her
eyes
were
so
different
from
the
saxton
darker
but
never
still
and
full
never
hesitating
dreading
a
wound
never
dilating
with
hurt
or
with
timid
ecstasy
are
you
ready
then
he
asked
smiling
down
on
her
what
she
asked
in
confusion
to
come
to
the
registrar
with
got
the
licence
but
i
just
going
to
make
the
pudding
she
cried
in
full
expostulation
let
them
make
it
your
hat
on
but
look
at
me
i
just
been
getting
the
gooseberries
look
she
showed
us
the
berries
and
the
scratches
on
her
arms
and
hands
what
a
shame
he
said
bending
down
to
stroke
her
hand
and
her
arm
she
drew
back
smiling
flushing
with
joy
i
could
smell
the
white
lilies
where
i
sat
but
you

repeated
george
in
a
passion
meg
began
to
cry
i
suppose
she
looked
at
him
through
her
tears
the
next
thing
i
heard
was
a
cry
from
the
old
woman

the
sound
of

my

old
woman
called
louder
and
louder
george
appeared
in
the
doorway
holding
meg
by
the
arm
she
was
crying
in
a
little
distress
her
hat
with
its
large
silk
roses
was
slanting
over
her
eyes
she
was
dressed
in
white
linen
they
mounted
the
trap
i
gave
him
the
reins
and
scrambled
up
behind
the
old
woman
heard
us
through
the
open
window
and
we
listened
to
her
calling
as
we
drove
away

tha

tha

an
then
dunna

ter
we
drove
out
of
hearing
george
sat
with
a
shut
mouth
scowling
meg
wept
awhile
to
herself
woefully
we
were
swinging
at
a
good
pace
under
the
beeches
of
the
churchyard
which
stood
above
the
level
of
the
road
meg
having
settled
her
hat
bent
her
head
to
the
wind
too
much
occupied
with
her
attire
to
weep
we
swung
round
the
hollow
by
the
bog
end
and
rattled
a
short
distance
up
the
steep
hill
to
watnall
then
the
mare
walked
slowly
meg
at
leisure
to
collect
herself
exclaimed
plaintively
oh
i
only
got
one
glove
she
looked
at
the
odd
silk
glove
that
lay
in
her
lap
then
peered
about
among
her
skirts
i
must
left
it
in
th
bedroom
she
said
piteously
he
laughed
and
his
anger
suddenly
vanished
what
does
it
matter
you
do
without
all
right
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
she
recollected
and
her
tears
and
her
weeping
returned
nay
he
said
do
fret
about
the
old
woman
she
come
round
if
she
does
it
her
lookout
she
got
polly
to
attend
to
her
but
she
be
that
wept
meg
it
her
own
fault
at
any
rate
do
let
it
make
you
miserable
glanced
to
see
if
anyone
were
in
sight
then
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
saying
softly
coaxingly
she
be
all
right
we
go
an
see
her
then
an
she
be
glad
enough
to
have
us
we
give
in
to
her
then
poor
old
she
can
boss
you
about
an
me
as
well
tomorrow
as
much
as
she
likes
she
feels
it
hard
being
tied
to
her
bed
but
is
ours
it
is
ours
an
you
not
sorry
are
you
but
i
got
no
gloves
an
i
sure
my
hair
a
sight
i
never
thought
she
could
reached
up
like
that
george
laughed
tickled
no
he
said
she
in
a
temper
but
we
can
get
you
some
gloves
directly
we
get
to
nottingham
i

a
farthing
of
money
she
said
i
plenty
he
laughed
oh
an
let
try
this
on
they
were
merry
together
as
he
tried
on
her
wedding
ring
and
they
talked
softly
he
gentle
and
coaxing
she
rather
plaintive
the
mare
took
her
own
way
and
meg
hat
was
disarranged
once
more
by
the
sweeping
the
yellow
corn
was
dipping
and
flowing
in
the
fields
like
a
cloth
of
gold
pegged
down
at
the
corners
under
which
the
wind
was
heaving
sometimes
we
passed
cottages
where
the
scarlet
lilies
rose
like
bonfires
and
the
tall
larkspur
like
bright
blue
leaping
smoke
sometimes
we
smelled
the
sunshine
on
the
browning
corn
sometimes
the
fragrance
of
the
shadow
of
leaves
occasionally
it
was
the
dizzy
scent
of
new
haystacks
then
we
rocked
and
jolted
over
the
rough
cobblestones
of
cinderhill
and
bounded
forward
again
at
the
foot
of
the
enormous
pit
hill
smelling
of
sulphur
inflamed
with
slow
red
fires
in
the
daylight
and
crusted
with
ashes
we
reached
the
top
of
the
rise
and
saw
the
city
before
us
heaped
high
and
dim
upon
the
broad
range
of
the
hill
i
looked
for
the
square
tower
of
my
old
school
and
the
sharp
proud
spire
of
andrews
over
the
city
hung
a
dullness
a
thin
dirty
canopy
against
the
blue
sky
we
turned
and
swung
down
the
slope
between
the
last
sullied
cornfields
towards
basford
where
the
swollen
gasometers
stood
like
toadstools
as
we
neared
the
mouth
of
the
street
meg
rose
excitedly
pulling
arm
crying
oh
look
the
poor
little
thing
on
the
causeway
stood
two
small
boys
lifting
their
faces
and
weeping
to
the
heedless
heavens
while
before
them
upside
down
lay
a
baby
strapped
to
a
the
thing
had
collapsed
as
the
boys
were
dismounting
the
with
it
it
had
fallen
backwards
and
they
were
unable
to
right
it
there
lay
the
infant
strapped
head
downwards
to
its
silly
cart
in
imminent
danger
of
suffocation
meg
leaped
out
and
dragged
the
child
from
the
wretched
chair
the
two
boys
drenched
with
tears
howled
on
meg
crouched
on
the
road
the
baby
on
her
knee
its
tiny
feet
dangling
against
her
skirt
she
soothed
the
pitiful
mite
she
hugged
it
to
her
and
kissed
it
and
hugged
it
and
rocked
it
in
an
abandonment
of
pity
when
at
last
the
childish
trio
were
silent
the
boys
shaken
only
by
the
last
ebbing
sobs
meg
calmed
also
from
her
frenzy
of
pity
for
the
little
thing
she
murmured
to
it
tenderly
and
wiped
its
wet
little
cheeks
with
her
handkerchief
soothing
kissing
fondling
the
bewildered
mite
smoothing
the
wet
strands
of
brown
hair
under
the
scrap
of
cotton
bonnet
twitching
the
inevitable
baby
cape
into
order
it
was
a
pretty
baby
with
wisps
of
silken
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
is
it
a
girl
i
asked
one
of
the
how
old
is
she
i
do
know
he
answered
awkwardly
we
about
a
three
week
why
is
she
your
sister
mother
keeps
were
very
reluctant
to
tell
us
anything
poor
little
lamb
cried
meg
in
another
access
of
pity
clasping
the
baby
to
her
bosom
with
one
hand
holding
its
winsome
slippered
feet
in
the
other
she
remained
thus
stung
through
with
acute
pity
crouching
folding
herself
over
the
mite
at
last
she
raised
her
head
and
said
in
a
voice
difficult
with
emotion
but
you
love
you
all
right
but
we
to
mind
replied
the
boy
in
great
confusion
surely
said
meg
surely
you
do
begrudge
that
poor
little
little
she
you
do
grumble
at
minding
her
a
the
boys
would
not
answer
oh
poor
little
lamb
poor
little
lamb
murmured
meg
over
the
child
condemning
with
bitterness
the
boys
and
the
whole
world
of
men
i
taught
one
of
the
lads
how
to
fold
and
unfold
the
wretched
chair
meg
very
reluctantly
seated
the
unfortunate
baby
therein
gently
fastening
her
with
the
strap
wheer
dummy
asked
one
of
the
boys
in
muffled
tones
the
infant
began
to
cry
thinly
meg
crouched
over
it
the
was
found
in
the
gutter
and
wiped
on
the
boy
coat
then
plugged
into
the
baby
mouth
meg
released
the
tiny
clasping
hand
from
over
her
finger
and
mounted
the
dog
cart
saying
sternly
to
the
boys
mind
you
look
after
her
well
poor
little
baby
with
no
mother
watching
to
see
what
you
do
to
you
be
careful
mind
they
stood
very
shamefaced
george
clicked
to
the
mare
and
as
we
started
threw
coppers
to
the
boys
while
we
drove
away
i
watched
the
little
group
diminish
down
the
road
it
such
a
shame
she
said
and
the
tears
were
in
her
voice
sweet
little
thing
like
ay
said
george
softly
there
all
sorts
of
things
in
towns
meg
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
sat
thinking
of
the
forlorn
baby
and
condemning
the
hard
world
he
full
of
tenderness
and
protectiveness
towards
her
having
watched
her
with
softening
eyes
felt
a
little
bit
rebuffed
that
she
ignored
him
and
sat
alone
in
her
fierce
womanhood
so
he
busied
himself
with
the
reins
and
the
two
sat
each
alone
until
meg
was
roused
by
the
bustle
of
the
town
the
mare
sidled
past
the
electric
cars
nervously
and
jumped
when
a
traction
engine
came
upon
us
meg
rather
frightened
clung
to
george
again
she
was
very
glad
when
we
had
passed
the
cemetery
with
its
white
population
of
tombstones
and
drew
up
in
a
quiet
street
but
when
we
had
dismounted
and
given
the
horse
head
to
a
loafer
she
became
confused
and
bashful
and
timid
to
the
last
degree
he
took
her
on
his
arm
he
took
the
whole
charge
of
her
and
laughing
bore
her
away
towards
the
steps
of
the
office
she
left
herself
entirely
in
his
hands
she
was
all
confusion
so
he
took
the
charge
of
her
when
after
a
short
time
they
came
out
she
began
to
chatter
with
blushful
animation
he
was
very
quiet
and
seemed
to
be
taking
his
breath
was
he
a
funny
little
man
did
i
do
it
all
proper
did
know
what
i
was
doing
i
sure
they
were
laughing
at
you
think
they
were
oh
just
look
at
my
a
sight
what
would
they
the
baby
had
slightly
soiled
the
front
of
her
dress
george
drove
up
the
long
hill
into
the
town
as
we
came
down
between
the
shops
on
mansfield
road
he
recovered
his
spirits
where
are
we
are
you
taking
us
asked
meg
we
may
as
well
make
a
day
of
it
while
we
are
here
he
answered
smiling
and
flicking
the
mare
they
both
felt
that
they
were
launched
forth
on
an
adventure
he
put
up
at
the
spread
eagle
and
we
walked
towards
the
for
meg
gloves
when
he
had
bought
her
these
and
a
large
lace
scarf
to
give
her
a
more
clothed
appearance
he
wanted
dinner
we
go
he
said
to
an
hôtel
his
eyes
dilated
as
he
said
it
and
she
shrank
away
with
delighted
fear
neither
of
them
had
ever
been
to
an
hôtel
she
was
really
afraid
she
begged
him
to
go
to
an
eating
house
to
a
café
he
was
obdurate
his
one
idea
was
to
do
the
thing
that
he
was
to
do
his
it
was
almost
to
dare
to
play
with
life
he
was
afraid
of
the
town
he
was
afraid
to
venture
into
the
foreign
places
of
life
and
all
was
foreign
save
the
valley
of
nethermere
so
he
crossed
the
borders
flauntingly
and
marched
towards
the
heart
of
the
unknown
we
went
to
the
victoria
most
imposing
he
could
think
we
had
luncheon
according
to
the
menu
they
were
like
two
children
very
much
afraid
yet
delighting
in
the
adventure
he
dared
not
however
give
the
orders
he
dared
not
address
anybody
waiters
or
otherwise
i
did
that
for
him
and
he
watched
me
absorbing
learning
wondering
that
things
were
so
easy
and
so
delightful
i
murmured
them
injunctions
across
the
table
and
they
blushed
and
laughed
with
each
other
nervously
it
would
be
hard
to
say
whether
they
enjoyed
that
luncheon
i
think
meg
did
though
she
was
with
him
but
of
george
i
am
doubtful
he
suffered
exquisitely
from
self
consciousness
and
nervous
embarrassment
but
he
felt
also
the
intoxication
of
the
adventure
he
felt
as
a
man
who
has
lived
in
a
small
island
when
he
first
sets
foot
on
a
vast
continent
this
was
the
first
step
into
a
new
life
and
he
mused
delightedly
upon
it
over
his
brandy
yet
he
was
nervous
he
could
not
get
over
the
feeling
that
he
was
trespassing
where
shall
we
go
this
afternoon
he
asked
several
things
were
proposed
but
meg
pleaded
warmly
for
colwick
let
go
on
a
steamer
to
colwick
park
there
be
entertainments
there
this
afternoon
it
be
lovely
in
a
few
moments
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
car
swinging
down
to
the
trent
bridges
it
was
dinner
time
and
crowds
of
people
from
shops
and
warehouses
were
hurrying
in
the
sunshine
along
the
pavements
sunblinds
cast
their
shadows
on
the
and
in
the
shade
streamed
the
people
dressed
brightly
for
summer
as
our
car
stood
in
the
great
space
of
the
market
place
we
could
smell
the
mingled
scent
of
fruit
oranges
and
small
apricots
and
pears
piled
in
their
vividly
coloured
sections
on
the
stalls
then
away
we
sailed
through
the
shadows
of
the
dark
streets
and
the
open
pools
of
sunshine
the
castle
on
its
high
rock
stood
in
the
dazzling
dry
sunlight
the
fountain
stood
shadowy
in
the
green
glimmer
of
the
lime
trees
that
surrounded
the
there
were
many
people
at
the
trent
we
stood
awhile
on
the
bridge
to
watch
the
bright
river
swirling
in
a
silent
dance
to
the
sea
while
the
light
lay
asleep
along
the
banks
we
went
on
board
the
little
paddle
steamer
and
paid
our
sixpence
return
after
much
waiting
we
set
off
with
great
excitement
for
our
voyage
two
banjos
were
tumming
somewhere
below
and
the
passengers
hummed
and
sang
to
their
tunes
a
few
boats
dabbled
on
the
water
soon
the
river
meadows
with
their
high
thorn
hedges
lay
green
on
our
right
while
the
scarp
of
red
rock
rose
on
our
left
covered
with
the
dark
trees
of
summer
we
landed
at
colwick
park
it
was
early
and
few
people
were
there
dead
glass
were
slung
about
the
trees
the
grass
in
places
was
worn
threadbare
we
walked
through
the
avenues
and
small
glades
of
the
park
till
we
came
to
the
boundary
where
the
stretched
its
level
green
its
winding
white
barriers
running
low
into
the
distance
they
sat
in
the
shade
for
some
time
while
i
wandered
about
then
many
people
began
to
arrive
it
became
noisy
even
rowdy
we
listened
for
some
time
to
an
concert
given
by
the
pierrots
it
was
rather
vulgar
and
very
tiresome
it
took
me
back
to
cowes
to
yarmouth
there
were
the
same
foolish
faces
the
same
perpetual
jingle
from
an
piano
the
restless
jigging
to
the
songs
the
same
choruses
the
same
escapading
meg
was
well
pleased
the
vulgarity
passed
by
her
she
laughed
and
sang
the
choruses
half
audibly
daring
but
not
bold
she
was
immensely
pleased
oh
it
ben
turn
now
i
like
him
he
got
such
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
eye
look
at
joey
trying
to
be
funny
ca
to
save
his
life
does
he
look
she
began
to
giggle
in
george
shoulder
he
saw
the
funny
side
of
things
for
the
time
and
laughed
with
her
during
tea
which
we
took
on
the
green
verandah
of
the
degraded
hall
she
was
constantly
breaking
forth
into
some
chorus
and
he
would
light
up
as
she
looked
at
him
and
sing
with
her
he
was
not
embarrassed
at
colwick
there
he
had
on
his
best
careless
superior
air
he
moved
about
with
a
certain
scornfulness
and
ordered
lobster
for
tea
this
also
was
a
new
walk
of
life
here
he
was
not
hesitating
or
tremulously
strung
he
was
patronising
both
meg
and
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
when
we
got
back
into
nottingham
she
entreated
him
not
to
go
to
the
hotel
as
he
had
proposed
and
he
readily
yielded
instead
they
went
to
the
castle
we
stood
on
the
high
rock
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
watched
the
sun
sloping
over
the
great
where
the
menial
town
spread
out
and
ended
while
the
river
and
the
meadows
continued
into
the
distance
in
the
picture
galleries
there
was
a
fine
collection
of
arthur
melville
paintings
meg
thought
them
very
ridiculous
i
began
to
expound
them
but
she
was
manifestly
bored
and
he
was
outside
in
the
grounds
was
a
military
band
playing
meg
longed
to
be
there
the
townspeople
were
dancing
on
the
grass
she
longed
to
join
them
but
she
could
not
dance
so
they
sat
awhile
looking
on
we
were
to
go
to
the
theatre
in
the
evening
the
carl
rosa
company
was
giving
carmen
at
the
royal
we
went
into
the
dress
circle
like
giddy
dukes
as
i
said
to
him
so
that
i
could
see
his
eyes
dilate
with
adventure
again
as
he
laughed
in
the
theatre
among
the
people
in
evening
dress
he
became
once
more
childish
and
timorous
he
had
always
the
air
of
one
who
does
something
forbidden
and
is
charmed
yet
fearful
like
a
trespassing
child
he
had
begun
to
trespass
that
day
outside
his
own
estates
of
nethermere
carmen
fascinated
them
both
the
gaudy
careless
southern
life
amazed
them
the
bold
free
way
in
which
carmen
played
with
life
startled
them
with
hints
of
freedom
they
stared
on
the
stage
fascinated
between
the
acts
they
held
each
other
hands
and
looked
full
into
each
wide
bright
eyes
and
laughing
with
excitement
talked
about
the
opera
the
theatre
surged
and
roared
dimly
like
a
hoarse
shell
then
the
music
rose
like
a
storm
and
swept
and
rattled
at
their
feet
on
the
stage
the
strange
storm
of
life
clashed
in
music
towards
tragedy
and
futile
death
the
two
were
shaken
with
a
tumult
of
wild
feeling
when
it
was
all
over
they
rose
bewildered
stunned
she
with
tears
in
her
eyes
he
with
a
strange
wild
beating
of
his
heart
they
were
both
in
a
tumult
of
confused
emotion
their
ears
were
full
of
the
roaring
passion
of
life
and
their
eyes
were
blinded
by
a
spray
of
tears
and
that
strange
quivering
laughter
which
burns
with
real
pain
they
hurried
along
the
pavement
to
the
spread
eagle
meg
clinging
to
him
running
clasping
her
lace
scarf
over
her
white
frock
like
a
scared
white
butterfly
shaken
through
the
night
we
hardly
spoke
as
the
horse
was
being
harnessed
and
the
lamps
lighted
in
the
little
smoke
room
he
drank
several
whiskies
she
sipping
out
of
his
glass
standing
all
the
time
ready
to
go
he
pushed
into
his
pocket
great
pieces
of
bread
and
cheese
to
eat
on
the
way
home
he
seemed
now
to
be
thinking
with
much
acuteness
his
few
orders
were
given
sharp
and
terse
he
hired
an
extra
light
rug
in
which
to
wrap
meg
and
then
we
were
ready
who
drives
said
i
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
faintly
you
he
answered
meg
like
an
impatient
white
flame
stood
waiting
in
the
light
of
the
lamps
he
covered
her
extinguished
her
in
the
dark
rug
chapter
ii
puffs
of
wind
in
the
sail
the
year
burst
into
glory
to
usher
us
forth
out
of
the
valley
of
nethermere
the
cherry
trees
had
been
gorgeous
with
heavy
boughs
of
red
and
gold
immense
vegetable
marrows
lay
prostrate
in
the
bottom
garden
their
great
tentacles
clutching
the
pond
bank
against
the
wall
the
globed
crimson
plums
hung
close
together
and
dropped
occasionally
with
a
satisfied
plunge
into
the
rhubarb
leaves
the
crop
of
oats
was
very
heavy
the
stalks
of
corn
were
like
strong
reeds
of
bamboo
the
heads
of
grain
swept
heavily
over
like
tresses
weighted
with
drops
of
gold
george
spent
his
time
between
the
mill
and
the
ram
the
grandmother
had
received
them
with
much
grumbling
but
with
real
gladness
meg
was
and
george
slept
at
the
ram
he
was
extraordinarily
bright
almost
gay
the
fact
was
that
his
new
life
interested
and
pleased
him
keenly
he
often
talked
to
me
about
meg
how
quaint
and
naïve
she
was
how
she
amused
him
and
delighted
him
he
rejoiced
in
having
a
place
of
his
own
a
home
and
a
beautiful
wife
who
adored
him
then
the
was
full
of
strangeness
and
interest
no
hour
was
ever
dull
if
he
wanted
company
he
could
go
into
the
if
he
wanted
quiet
he
could
sit
with
meg
and
she
was
such
a
treat
so
soft
and
warm
and
so
amusing
he
was
always
laughing
at
her
quaint
crude
notions
and
at
her
queer
little
turns
of
speech
she
talked
to
him
with
a
little
language
she
sat
on
his
knee
and
twisted
his
mustache
finding
small
unreal
fault
with
his
features
for
the
delight
of
dwelling
upon
them
he
was
he
said
incredibly
happy
really
he
could
not
believe
it
meg
was
ah
she
was
a
treat
then
he
would
laugh
thinking
how
indifferent
he
had
been
about
taking
her
a
little
shadow
might
cross
his
eyes
but
he
would
laugh
again
and
tell
me
one
of
his
wife
funny
little
notions
she
was
quite
uneducated
and
such
fun
he
said
i
looked
at
him
as
he
sounded
this
note
i
remembered
his
crude
superiority
of
early
days
which
had
angered
emily
so
deeply
there
was
in
him
something
of
the
prig
i
did
not
like
his
amused
indulgence
of
his
wife
at
threshing
day
when
i
worked
for
the
last
time
at
the
mill
i
noticed
the
new
tendency
in
him
the
saxtons
had
always
kept
up
a
certain
proud
reserve
in
former
years
the
family
had
moved
into
the
parlour
on
threshing
day
and
an
extra
woman
had
been
hired
to
wait
on
the
men
who
came
with
the
machine
this
time
george
suggested
let
us
have
dinner
with
the
men
in
the
kitchen
cyril
they
are
a
rum
gang
it
rather
good
sport
mixing
with
them
they
seen
a
bit
of
life
and
i
like
to
hear
them
they
so
blunt
they
good
studies
though
the
farmer
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
seven
men
trooped
in
very
sheepish
and
took
their
places
they
had
not
much
to
say
at
first
they
were
a
mixed
set
some
rather
small
young
and
furtive
looking
some
unshapely
and
coarse
with
unpleasant
eyes
the
eyelids
slack
there
was
one
man
whom
we
called
the
parrot
because
he
had
a
hooked
nose
and
put
forward
his
head
as
he
talked
he
had
been
a
very
large
man
but
he
was
grey
and
bending
at
the
shoulders
his
face
was
pale
and
fleshy
and
his
eyes
seemed
dull
sighted
george
patronised
the
men
and
they
did
not
object
he
chaffed
them
making
a
good
deal
of
demonstration
in
giving
them
more
beer
he
invited
them
to
pass
up
their
plates
called
the
woman
to
bring
more
bread
and
altogether
played
mine
host
of
a
feast
of
beggars
the
parrot
ate
very
slowly
come
dad
said
george
you
not
getting
on
not
got
many
what
i
got
in
th
road
is
ter
get
em
out
i
can
manage
bare
gums
like
a
baby
again
second
childhood
eh
ah
well
we
must
all
come
to
it
george
laughed
the
old
man
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
him
and
said
slowly
got
ter
ower
th
first
afore
that
george
laughed
unperturbed
evidently
he
was
well
used
to
the
thrusts
of
the
i
suppose
you
soon
got
over
yours
he
said
the
old
man
raised
himself
and
his
eyes
flickered
into
life
he
chewed
slowly
then
said
i
married
an
paid
for
it
i
broke
a
constable
jaw
an
paid
for
it
i
deserted
from
the
army
an
paid
for
that
i
had
a
bullet
through
my
cheek
in
india
atop
of
it
all
by
i
was
your
age
oh
said
george
with
condescending
interest
you
seen
a
bit
of
life
then
they
drew
the
old
man
out
and
he
told
them
in
his
slow
laconic
fashion
a
few
brutal
stories
they
laughed
and
chaffed
him
george
seemed
to
have
a
thirst
for
tales
of
brutal
experience
the
raw
gin
of
life
he
drank
it
all
in
with
relish
enjoying
the
sensation
the
dinner
was
over
it
was
time
to
go
out
again
to
work
and
how
old
are
you
dad
george
asked
the
parrot
looked
at
him
again
with
his
heavy
tired
ironic
eyes
and
answered
if
you
be
any
better
for
it
a
bit
rough
on
you
is
it
continued
the
young
man
going
round
with
the
threshing
machine
and
sleeping
outdoors
at
that
time
of
life
i
should
thought
you
wanted
a
bit
o
how
do
you
mean
on
me
the
parrot
replied
slowly
oh
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
answered
george
easily
do
know
as
i
do
said
the
slow
old
parrot
well
you
have
made
exactly
a
good
thing
out
of
life
have
you
what
mean
by
a
good
thing
i
had
my
life
an
i
satisfied
wi
it
is
die
with
a
full
belly
oh
so
you
have
saved
a
bit
no
said
the
old
man
deliberately
i
spent
as
i
gone
on
i
had
all
i
wish
for
but
i
pity
the
angels
when
the
lord
sets
me
before
them
like
a
book
to
read
heaven
wo
be
heaven
just
then
you
a
philosopher
in
your
way
laughed
george
and
you
replied
the
old
man
toddling
about
your
think
yourself
mighty
wise
but
your
wisdom
go
with
your
teeth
learn
in
time
to
say
nothing
the
old
man
went
out
and
began
his
work
carrying
the
sacks
of
corn
from
the
machine
to
the
chamber
there
a
lot
in
the
old
parrot
said
george
as
he
never
tell
i
laughed
he
makes
you
feel
as
well
as
if
you
a
lot
to
discover
in
life
he
continued
looking
thoughtfully
over
the
dusty
at
the
chuffing
machine
after
the
harvest
was
ended
the
father
began
to
deplete
his
farm
most
of
the
stock
was
transferred
to
the
ram
george
was
going
to
take
over
his
father
milk
business
and
was
going
to
farm
enough
of
the
land
attaching
to
the
inn
to
support
nine
or
ten
cows
until
the
spring
however
saxton
retained
his
own
milk
round
and
worked
at
improving
the
condition
of
the
land
ready
for
the
valuation
george
with
three
cows
started
a
little
milk
supply
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
inn
prepared
his
land
for
the
summer
and
helped
in
the
emily
was
the
first
to
depart
finally
from
the
mill
she
went
to
a
school
in
nottingham
and
shortly
afterwards
mollie
her
younger
sister
went
to
her
in
october
i
moved
to
london
lettie
and
leslie
were
settled
in
their
home
in
brentwood
yorkshire
we
all
felt
very
keenly
our
exile
from
nethermere
but
as
yet
the
bonds
were
not
broken
only
use
could
sever
them
christmas
brought
us
all
home
again
hastening
to
greet
each
other
there
was
a
slight
change
in
everybody
lettie
was
brighter
more
imperious
and
very
gay
emily
was
quiet
and
looked
happier
leslie
was
jollier
and
at
the
same
time
more
subdued
and
earnest
george
looked
very
healthy
and
happy
and
sounded
well
pleased
with
himself
my
mother
with
her
gaiety
at
our
return
brought
tears
to
our
eyes
we
dined
one
evening
at
highclose
with
the
tempests
it
was
dull
as
usual
and
we
left
before
ten
lettie
had
changed
her
shoes
and
put
on
a
fine
cloak
of
greenish
blue
we
walked
over
the
road
the
ice
on
nethermere
gleamed
mysteriously
in
the
moonlight
and
uttered
strange
whoops
and
yelps
the
moon
was
very
high
in
the
sky
small
and
brilliant
like
a
vial
full
of
the
pure
white
liquid
of
light
there
was
no
sound
in
the
night
save
the
haunting
movement
of
the
ice
and
the
clear
tinkle
of
lettie
laughter
on
the
drive
leading
to
the
wood
we
saw
someone
approaching
the
wild
grass
was
grey
on
either
side
the
thorn
trees
stood
with
shaggy
black
beards
sweeping
down
the
pine
trees
were
erect
like
dark
soldiers
the
black
shape
of
the
man
drew
near
with
a
shadow
running
at
its
feet
i
recognised
george
obscured
as
he
was
in
his
cap
and
his
upturned
collar
lettie
was
in
front
with
her
husband
as
george
was
passing
she
said
in
bright
clear
tones
a
happy
new
year
to
you
he
stopped
swung
round
and
laughed
i
thought
you
would
have
known
me
he
said
what
is
it
you
george
cried
lettie
in
great
now
what
a
joke
how
are
you
put
out
her
white
hand
from
her
draperies
he
took
it
and
answered
i
am
very
however
meaningless
the
words
were
the
tone
was
curiously
friendly
intimate
informal
as
you
see
she
replied
laughing
interested
in
his
but
where
are
you
going
i
am
going
home
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
meant
have
you
forgotten
that
i
too
am
married
oh
of
course
cried
lettie
you
are
now
mine
host
of
the
ram
you
must
tell
me
about
it
may
i
ask
him
to
come
home
with
us
for
an
hour
mother
is
new
year
eve
you
know
you
have
asked
him
already
laughed
mother
will
saxton
spare
you
for
so
long
asked
lettie
of
george
meg
oh
she
does
not
order
my
comings
and
goings
does
she
not
laughed
lettie
she
is
very
unwise
train
up
a
husband
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
in
after
i
never
could
quote
a
text
from
end
to
end
i
am
full
of
beginnings
but
as
for
a
leslie
my
is
i
wait
till
i
can
put
my
foot
on
the
fence
leslie
knelt
down
at
her
feet
she
shook
the
hood
back
from
her
head
and
her
ornaments
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
her
face
with
its
whiteness
and
its
shadows
was
full
of
fascination
and
in
their
dark
recesses
her
eyes
thrilled
george
with
hidden
magic
she
smiled
at
him
along
her
cheeks
while
her
husband
crouched
before
her
then
as
the
three
walked
along
towards
the
wood
she
flung
her
draperies
into
loose
eloquence
and
there
was
a
glimpse
of
her
bosom
white
with
the
moon
she
laughed
and
chattered
and
shook
her
silken
stuffs
sending
out
a
perfume
exquisite
on
the
frosted
air
when
we
reached
the
house
lettie
dropped
her
draperies
and
rustled
into
the
there
the
lamp
was
shedding
a
yellow
twilight
from
the
window
space
lettie
stood
between
the
firelight
and
the
dusky
lamp
glow
tall
and
warm
between
the
lights
as
she
turned
laughing
to
the
two
men
she
let
her
cloak
slide
over
her
white
shoulder
and
fall
with
silk
splendour
of
a
peacock
gorgeous
blue
over
the
arm
of
the
large
settee
there
she
stood
with
her
white
hand
upon
the
peacock
of
her
cloak
where
it
tumbled
against
her
dull
orange
dress
she
knew
her
own
splendour
and
she
drew
up
her
throat
laughing
and
brilliant
with
triumph
then
she
raised
both
her
arms
to
her
head
and
remained
for
a
moment
delicately
touching
her
hair
into
order
still
fronting
the
two
men
then
with
a
final
little
laugh
she
moved
slowly
and
turned
up
the
lamp
dispelling
some
of
the
witchcraft
from
the
room
she
had
developed
strangely
in
six
months
she
seemed
to
have
discovered
the
wonderful
charm
of
her
womanhood
as
she
leaned
forward
with
her
arm
outstretched
to
the
lamp
as
she
delicately
adjusted
the
wicks
with
mysterious
fingers
she
seemed
to
be
moving
in
some
alluring
figure
of
a
dance
her
hair
like
a
nimbus
clouding
the
light
her
bosom
lit
with
wonder
the
soft
outstretching
of
her
hand
was
like
the
whispering
of
strange
words
into
the
blood
and
as
she
fingered
a
book
the
heart
watched
silently
for
the
meaning
wo
you
take
off
my
shoes
darling
she
said
sinking
among
the
cushions
of
the
settee
leslie
kneeled
again
before
her
and
she
bent
her
head
and
watched
him
my
feet
are
a
tiny
bit
cold
she
said
plaintively
giving
him
her
foot
that
seemed
like
gold
in
the
yellow
silk
stocking
he
took
it
between
his
hands
stroking
it
it
is
quite
cold
he
said
and
he
held
both
her
feet
in
his
hands
ah
you
dear
boy
she
cried
with
sudden
gentleness
bending
forward
and
touching
his
cheek
is
it
great
fun
being
mine
host
of
ramme
inne
she
said
playfully
to
george
there
seemed
a
long
distance
between
them
now
as
she
sat
with
the
man
in
evening
dress
crouching
before
her
putting
golden
shoes
on
her
feet
it
is
rather
he
replied
the
men
in
the
smoke
room
say
such
rum
things
my
word
you
hear
some
tales
there
tell
us
do
she
pleaded
oh
i
could
i
never
could
tell
a
tale
and
even
if
i
but
i
do
long
to
hear
she
said
what
the
men
say
in
the
smoke
room
of
ramme
inne
is
it
quite
untellable
quite
he
laughed
what
a
pity
see
what
a
cruel
thing
it
is
to
be
a
woman
leslie
we
never
know
what
men
say
in
smoke
rooms
while
you
read
in
your
novels
everything
a
woman
ever
uttered
it
is
a
shame
george
you
are
a
wretch
you
should
tell
me
i
do
envy
what
do
you
envy
me
exactly
he
asked
laughing
always
at
her
whimsical
way
your
smoke
room
the
way
you
see
the
way
you
hear
it
rather
but
i
should
have
thought
you
saw
life
ten
times
more
than
me
he
replied
i
i
only
see
manners
and
bad
manners
you
know
maketh
a
man
that
when
a
woman
there
but
you
wait
awhile
see
when
shall
i
see
asked
george
flattered
and
interested
when
you
have
made
the
fortune
you
talked
about
she
replied
he
was
uplifted
by
her
remembering
the
things
he
had
said
but
when
i
have
made
said
sceptically
even
i
shall
only
be
or
have
been
landlord
of
ramme
inne
he
looked
at
her
waiting
for
her
to
lift
up
his
hopes
with
her
gay
balloons
oh
that
does
matter
leslie
might
be
landlord
of
some
ram
inn
when
he
at
home
for
all
anybody
would
you
hubby
dear
thanks
replied
leslie
with
good
humoured
sarcasm
you
ca
tell
a
publican
from
a
peer
if
he
a
rich
publican
she
continued
money
maketh
the
man
you
know
plus
manners
added
george
laughing
oh
they
are
always
i
am
i
give
you
ten
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
you
must
invite
us
to
your
swell
the
hall
at
we
will
with
all
our
numerous
array
she
sat
among
her
cushions
smiling
upon
him
she
was
half
ironical
half
sincere
he
smiled
back
at
her
his
dark
eyes
full
of
trembling
hope
and
pleasure
and
pride
how
is
meg
she
asked
is
she
as
charming
as
have
you
spoiled
her
oh
she
is
as
charming
as
ever
he
replied
and
we
are
tremendously
fond
of
one
another
that
is
right
do
think
men
are
delightful
she
added
smiling
i
am
glad
you
think
so
he
laughed
they
talked
on
brightly
about
a
thousand
things
she
touched
on
paris
and
pictures
and
new
music
with
her
quick
chatter
sounding
to
george
wonderful
in
her
culture
and
facility
and
at
last
he
said
he
must
go
not
until
you
have
eaten
a
biscuit
and
drunk
good
luck
with
me
she
cried
catching
her
dress
about
her
like
a
dim
flame
and
running
out
of
the
room
we
all
drank
to
the
new
year
in
the
cold
champagne
to
the
said
lettie
and
we
drank
smiling
hark
said
george
the
hooters
we
stood
still
and
listened
there
was
a
faint
booing
noise
far
away
outside
it
was
midnight
lettie
caught
up
a
wrap
and
we
went
to
the
door
the
wood
the
ice
the
grey
dim
hills
lay
frozen
in
the
light
of
the
moon
but
outside
the
valley
far
away
in
derbyshire
away
towards
nottingham
on
every
hand
the
distant
hooters
and
buzzers
of
mines
and
ironworks
crowed
small
on
the
borders
of
the
night
like
so
many
strange
low
voices
of
cockerels
bursting
forth
at
different
pitch
with
different
tone
warning
us
of
the
dawn
of
the
new
year
chapter
iii
the
first
pages
of
several
romances
i
found
a
good
deal
of
difference
in
leslie
since
his
marriage
he
had
lost
his
assertive
he
no
longer
pronounced
emphatically
and
ultimately
on
every
subject
nor
did
he
seek
to
dominate
as
he
had
always
done
the
company
in
which
he
found
himself
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
so
courteous
and
attentive
to
george
he
moved
unobtrusively
about
the
room
while
lettie
was
chattering
and
in
his
demeanour
there
was
a
new
reserve
a
gentleness
and
grace
it
was
charming
to
see
him
offering
the
cigarettes
to
george
or
with
beautiful
tact
asking
with
his
eyes
only
whether
he
should
refill
the
glass
of
his
guest
and
afterward
replacing
it
softly
close
to
the
other
hand
to
lettie
he
was
unfailingly
attentive
courteous
and
undemonstrative
towards
the
end
of
my
holiday
he
had
to
go
to
london
on
business
and
we
agreed
to
take
the
journey
together
we
must
leave
woodside
soon
after
eight
in
the
morning
lettie
and
he
had
separate
rooms
i
thought
she
would
not
have
risen
to
take
breakfast
with
us
but
at
a
seven
just
as
rebecca
was
bringing
in
the
coffee
she
came
downstairs
she
wore
a
blue
morning
gown
and
her
hair
was
as
beautifully
dressed
as
usual
why
my
darling
you
should
have
troubled
to
come
down
so
early
said
leslie
as
he
kissed
her
of
course
i
should
come
down
she
replied
lifting
back
the
heavy
curtains
and
looking
out
on
the
snow
where
the
darkness
was
wilting
into
daylight
i
should
not
let
you
go
away
into
the
cold
without
having
seen
you
take
a
good
breakfast
i
think
it
is
thawing
the
snow
on
the
rhododendrons
looks
sodden
and
drooping
ah
well
we
can
keep
out
the
dismal
of
the
morning
for
another
hour
she
glanced
at
the
just
an
hour
she
added
he
turned
to
her
with
a
swift
tenderness
she
smiled
to
him
and
sat
down
at
the
we
took
our
places
at
table
i
think
i
shall
come
back
he
said
quietly
almost
appealingly
she
watched
the
flow
of
the
coffee
before
she
answered
then
the
brass
urn
swung
back
and
she
lifted
her
face
to
hand
him
the
cup
you
will
not
do
anything
so
foolish
leslie
she
said
calmly
he
took
his
cup
thanking
her
and
bent
his
face
over
the
fragrant
steam
i
can
easily
catch
the
from
pancras
he
replied
without
looking
up
have
i
sweetened
to
your
liking
cyril
she
asked
and
then
as
she
stirred
her
coffee
she
added
it
is
ridiculous
leslie
you
catch
the
and
very
probably
miss
the
connection
at
nottingham
you
ca
have
the
there
because
of
the
roads
besides
it
is
absurd
to
come
toiling
home
in
the
cold
slushy
night
when
you
may
just
as
well
stay
in
london
and
be
comfortable
at
any
rate
i
should
get
the
down
to
lawton
hill
he
urged
but
there
is
no
need
she
replied
there
is
not
the
faintest
need
for
you
to
come
home
it
is
really
absurd
of
you
think
of
all
the
discomfort
indeed
i
should
not
want
to
come
trailing
dismally
home
at
midnight
i
should
not
indeed
you
would
be
simply
wretched
stay
and
have
a
jolly
evening
with
cyril
he
kept
his
head
bent
over
his
plate
and
did
not
reply
his
persistence
irritated
her
slightly
that
is
what
you
can
do
she
said
go
to
the
pantomime
or
to
maeterlinck
bird
i
am
sure
that
is
on
somewhere
i
wonder
if
rebecca
has
destroyed
yesterday
paper
do
you
mind
touching
the
bell
cyril
rebecca
came
and
the
paper
was
discovered
lettie
carefully
read
the
notices
and
planned
for
us
with
zest
a
delightful
programme
for
the
evening
leslie
listened
to
it
all
in
silence
when
the
time
had
come
for
our
departure
lettie
came
with
us
into
the
hall
to
see
that
we
were
well
wrapped
up
leslie
had
spoken
very
few
words
she
was
conscious
that
he
was
deeply
offended
but
her
manner
was
quite
calm
and
she
petted
us
both
brightly
dear
she
said
to
him
when
he
came
mutely
to
kiss
her
you
know
it
would
have
been
miserable
for
you
to
sit
all
those
hours
in
the
train
at
night
you
will
have
ever
such
a
jolly
time
i
know
you
will
i
shall
look
for
you
then
he
went
down
the
steps
and
into
the
car
without
looking
at
her
she
waited
in
the
doorway
as
we
moved
round
in
the
morning
she
seemed
to
harbour
the
glittering
blue
sky
and
the
sunshine
of
march
in
her
dress
and
her
luxuriant
hair
he
did
not
look
at
her
till
we
were
curving
to
the
great
rhododendrons
when
at
the
last
moment
he
stood
up
in
a
sudden
panic
to
wave
to
her
almost
as
he
saw
her
the
bushes
came
between
them
and
he
dropped
dejectedly
into
his
seat
we
heard
her
call
cheerfully
and
tenderly
like
a
blackbird
i
answered
and
darling
he
cried
suddenly
starting
up
in
a
passion
of
forgiveness
and
tenderness
the
car
went
cautiously
down
the
soddened
white
path
under
the
trees
i
suffered
acutely
the
sickness
of
exile
in
norwood
for
weeks
i
wandered
the
streets
of
the
suburb
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
some
part
of
nethermere
as
i
went
along
the
quiet
roads
where
the
lamps
in
yellow
loneliness
stood
among
the
leafless
trees
of
the
night
i
would
feel
the
feeling
of
the
dark
wet
bit
of
path
between
the
wood
meadow
and
the
brooks
the
spirit
of
that
wild
little
slope
to
the
mill
would
come
upon
me
and
there
in
the
suburb
of
london
i
would
walk
wrapt
in
the
sense
of
a
small
wet
place
in
the
valley
of
nethermere
a
strange
voice
within
me
rose
and
called
for
the
hill
path
again
i
could
feel
the
wood
waiting
for
me
calling
and
calling
and
i
crying
for
the
wood
yet
the
space
of
many
miles
was
between
us
since
i
left
the
valley
of
home
i
have
not
much
feared
any
other
loss
the
hills
of
nethermere
had
been
my
walls
and
the
sky
of
nethermere
my
roof
overhead
it
seemed
almost
as
if
at
home
i
might
lift
my
hand
to
the
ceiling
of
the
valley
and
touch
my
own
beloved
sky
whose
familiar
clouds
came
again
and
again
to
visit
me
whose
stars
were
constant
to
me
born
when
i
was
born
whose
sun
had
been
all
my
father
to
me
but
now
the
skies
were
strange
over
my
head
and
orion
walked
past
me
unnoticing
he
who
night
after
night
had
stood
over
the
woods
to
spend
with
me
a
wonderful
hour
when
does
day
now
lift
up
the
confines
of
my
dwelling
place
when
does
the
night
throw
open
her
vastness
for
me
and
send
me
the
stars
for
company
there
is
no
night
in
a
city
how
can
i
lose
myself
in
the
magnificent
forest
of
darkness
when
night
is
only
a
thin
scattering
of
the
trees
of
shadow
with
barrenness
of
lights
between
i
could
never
lift
my
eyes
save
to
the
crystal
palace
crouching
cowering
wretchedly
among
the
clouds
pricking
up
its
two
round
towers
like
pillars
of
anxious
misery
no
landmark
could
have
been
more
foreign
to
me
more
depressing
than
the
great
dilapidated
palace
which
lay
forever
prostrate
above
us
fretting
because
of
its
own
degradation
and
ruin
i
watched
the
buds
coming
on
the
brown
almond
trees
i
heard
the
blackbirds
and
i
saw
the
restless
starlings
in
the
streets
were
many
heaps
of
violets
and
men
held
forward
to
me
snowdrops
whose
white
mute
lips
were
pushed
upwards
in
a
bunch
but
these
things
had
no
meaning
for
me
and
little
interest
most
eagerly
i
waited
for
my
letters
emily
wrote
to
me
very
constantly
do
you
find
it
quite
exhilarating
almost
intoxicating
to
be
so
free
i
think
it
is
quite
wonderful
at
home
you
can
not
live
your
own
life
you
have
to
struggle
to
keep
even
a
little
apart
for
yourself
it
is
so
hard
to
stand
aloof
from
our
mothers
and
yet
they
are
only
hurt
and
insulted
if
you
tell
them
what
is
in
your
heart
it
is
such
a
relief
not
to
have
to
be
anything
to
anybody
but
just
to
please
yourself
i
am
sure
mother
and
i
have
suffered
a
great
deal
from
trying
to
keep
up
our
old
relations
yet
she
would
not
let
me
go
when
i
come
home
in
the
evening
and
think
that
i
need
say
anything
to
anybody
nor
do
anything
for
anybody
but
just
have
the
evening
for
myself
i
am
overjoyed
i
have
begun
to
write
a
again
a
little
later
she
wrote
as
i
go
to
school
by
old
brayford
village
in
the
morning
the
birds
are
thrilling
wonderfully
and
everything
seems
stirring
very
likely
there
will
be
a
and
after
that
spring
will
come
in
truth
when
shall
you
come
and
see
me
i
can
not
think
of
a
spring
without
you
the
railways
are
the
only
fine
exciting
things
is
only
a
few
yards
away
from
school
all
day
long
i
am
watching
the
great
midland
trains
go
south
they
are
very
lucky
to
be
able
to
rush
southward
through
the
sunshine
the
crows
are
very
interesting
they
flap
past
all
the
time
we
out
in
the
yard
the
railways
and
the
crows
make
the
charm
of
my
life
in
brayford
the
other
day
i
saw
no
end
of
pairs
of
crows
do
you
remember
what
they
say
at
home
for
sorrow
very
often
one
solitary
creature
sits
on
the
telegraph
wires
i
almost
hate
him
when
i
look
at
him
i
think
my
badge
for
life
ought
to
again
a
little
later
i
have
been
home
for
the
is
it
nice
to
be
made
much
of
to
be
an
important
cherished
person
for
a
little
time
it
is
quite
a
new
experience
for
me
the
snowdrops
are
full
out
among
the
grass
in
the
front
such
a
lot
i
imagined
you
must
come
in
the
sunshine
of
the
sunday
afternoon
to
see
them
it
did
not
seem
possible
you
should
not
the
winter
aconites
are
out
along
the
hedge
i
knelt
and
kissed
them
i
have
been
so
glad
to
go
away
to
breathe
the
free
air
of
life
but
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
come
away
from
the
aconites
i
have
sent
you
they
much
withered
now
i
am
in
my
lodgings
i
have
the
quite
unusual
feeling
of
being
contented
to
stay
here
a
little
above
a
year
i
am
sure
but
even
to
be
contented
for
a
little
while
is
enough
for
in
the
beginning
of
march
i
had
a
letter
from
the
father
you
not
see
us
again
in
the
old
place
we
shall
be
gone
in
a
fortnight
the
things
are
most
of
them
gone
already
george
has
got
bob
and
flower
i
have
sold
three
of
the
cows
stafford
and
julia
and
hannah
the
place
looks
very
empty
i
do
like
going
past
the
cowsheds
and
we
miss
hearing
the
horses
stamp
at
night
but
i
shall
not
be
sorry
when
we
have
really
gone
i
begin
to
feel
as
if
we
stagnated
here
i
begin
to
feel
as
if
i
was
settling
and
getting
narrow
and
dull
it
will
be
a
new
lease
of
life
to
get
away
but
i
wondering
how
we
shall
be
over
there
saxton
feels
very
nervous
about
going
but
at
the
worst
we
can
but
come
back
i
feel
as
if
i
must
go
somewhere
it
stagnation
and
starvation
for
us
here
i
wish
george
would
come
with
me
i
never
thought
he
would
have
taken
to
keeping
but
he
seems
to
like
it
all
right
he
was
down
with
meg
on
sunday
saxton
says
he
getting
a
tone
he
is
certainly
much
livelier
more
full
of
talk
than
he
was
meg
and
he
seem
very
comfortable
i
glad
to
say
he
got
a
good
and
i
no
doubt
but
what
he
do
well
he
is
very
cautious
at
the
bottom
he
never
lose
much
if
he
never
makes
much
sam
and
david
are
very
great
friends
i
glad
i
got
the
boy
we
often
talk
of
you
it
would
be
very
lonely
if
it
was
for
the
excitement
of
selling
things
and
so
on
saxton
hopes
you
will
stick
by
george
she
worries
a
bit
about
him
thinking
he
may
go
wrong
i
do
think
he
will
ever
go
far
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
you
were
keeping
friends
saxton
says
she
will
write
to
you
about
george
was
a
very
poor
correspondent
i
soon
ceased
to
expect
a
letter
from
him
i
received
one
directly
after
the
father
my
dear
cyril
forgive
me
for
not
having
written
you
before
but
you
see
i
can
not
sit
down
and
write
to
you
any
time
if
i
can
not
do
it
just
when
i
am
in
the
mood
i
can
not
do
it
at
all
and
it
so
often
happens
that
the
mood
comes
upon
me
when
i
am
in
the
fields
at
work
when
it
is
impossible
to
write
last
night
i
sat
by
myself
in
the
kitchen
on
purpose
to
write
to
you
and
then
i
could
not
all
day
at
greymede
when
i
was
drilling
in
the
fallow
at
the
back
of
the
church
i
had
been
thinking
of
you
and
i
could
have
written
there
if
i
had
had
materials
but
i
had
not
and
at
night
i
could
not
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
in
my
last
letter
i
did
not
thank
you
for
the
books
i
have
not
read
them
both
but
i
have
nearly
finished
evelyn
innes
i
get
a
bit
tired
of
it
towards
the
end
i
do
not
do
much
reading
now
there
seems
to
be
hardly
any
chance
for
me
either
somebody
is
crying
for
me
in
the
smoke
room
or
there
is
some
business
or
else
meg
wo
let
me
she
does
like
me
to
read
at
night
she
says
i
ought
to
talk
to
her
so
i
have
to
it
is
seven
and
i
am
sitting
ready
dressed
to
go
and
talk
to
harry
jackson
about
a
young
horse
he
wants
to
sell
to
me
he
is
in
pretty
low
water
and
it
will
make
a
pretty
good
horse
but
i
do
care
much
whether
i
have
it
or
not
the
mood
seized
me
to
write
to
you
somehow
at
the
bottom
i
feel
miserable
and
heavy
yet
there
is
no
need
i
am
making
pretty
good
money
and
i
got
all
i
want
but
when
been
ploughing
and
getting
the
oats
in
those
fields
on
the
hillside
at
the
back
of
greymede
church
i
felt
as
if
i
did
care
whether
i
got
on
or
not
it
very
funny
last
week
i
made
over
five
pounds
clear
one
way
and
another
and
yet
now
i
as
restless
and
discontented
as
i
can
be
and
i
seem
eager
for
something
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
sometimes
i
wonder
where
i
am
going
yesterday
i
watched
broken
white
masses
of
cloud
sailing
across
the
sky
in
a
fresh
strong
wind
they
all
seemed
to
be
going
somewhere
i
wondered
where
the
wind
was
blowing
them
i
do
seem
to
have
hold
on
anything
do
i
can
you
tell
me
what
i
want
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
wish
you
were
here
then
i
think
i
should
not
feel
like
this
but
generally
i
do
generally
i
am
quite
jolly
and
busy
by
jove
here
harry
jackson
come
for
me
i
will
finish
this
letter
when
i
get
back
have
got
back
we
have
turned
out
but
i
can
not
finish
i
can
not
tell
you
all
about
it
i
had
a
little
row
with
meg
oh
i
had
a
rotten
time
but
i
can
not
tell
you
about
it
it
is
late
and
i
am
tired
and
have
a
headache
some
other
time
george
saxton
the
spring
came
bravely
even
in
south
london
and
the
town
was
filled
with
magic
i
never
knew
the
sumptuous
purple
of
evening
till
i
saw
the
round
fill
with
light
and
roll
like
golden
bubbles
along
the
purple
dusk
of
the
high
road
everywhere
at
night
the
city
is
filled
with
the
magic
of
lamps
over
the
river
they
pour
in
golden
patches
their
floating
luminous
oil
on
the
restless
darkness
the
bright
lamps
float
in
and
out
of
the
cavern
of
london
bridge
station
like
round
shining
bees
in
and
out
of
a
black
hive
in
the
suburbs
the
street
lamps
glimmer
with
the
brightness
of
lemons
among
the
trees
i
began
to
love
the
town
in
the
mornings
i
loved
to
move
in
the
aimless
street
procession
watching
the
faces
come
near
to
me
with
the
sudden
glance
of
dark
eyes
watching
the
mouths
of
the
women
blossom
with
talk
as
they
passed
watching
the
subtle
movements
of
the
shoulders
of
men
beneath
their
coats
and
the
naked
warmth
of
their
necks
that
went
glowing
along
the
street
i
loved
the
city
intensely
for
its
movement
of
men
and
women
the
soft
fascinating
flow
of
the
limbs
of
men
and
women
and
the
sudden
flash
of
eyes
and
lips
as
they
pass
among
all
the
faces
of
the
street
my
attention
roved
like
a
bee
which
clambers
drunkenly
among
blue
flowers
i
became
intoxicated
with
the
strange
nectar
which
i
sipped
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
i
did
not
know
how
time
was
hastening
by
on
still
bright
wings
till
i
saw
the
scarlet
hawthorn
flaunting
over
the
road
and
the
lit
up
like
wine
drops
in
the
sun
and
the
pink
scarves
of
the
pretty
as
in
the
gutters
and
a
tangle
of
almond
boughs
against
the
blue
sky
the
lilacs
came
out
and
in
the
pensive
stillness
of
the
suburb
at
night
came
the
delicious
tarry
scent
of
lilac
flowers
wakening
a
silent
laughter
of
romance
across
all
this
strangely
came
the
bleak
sounds
of
home
alice
wrote
to
me
at
the
end
of
may
cyril
dear
prepare
yourself
meg
has
got
i
went
up
to
see
how
she
was
this
afternoon
not
knowing
anything
and
there
i
found
a
pair
of
bubs
in
the
nest
and
old
ma
stainwright
bossing
the
show
i
nearly
fainted
sybil
dear
i
hardly
knew
whether
to
laugh
or
to
cry
when
i
saw
those
two
rummy
little
round
heads
like
two
larch
cones
cheek
by
cheek
on
a
twig
one
is
a
darkie
with
lots
of
black
hair
and
the
other
is
red
would
you
believe
it
just
lit
up
with
thin
red
hair
like
a
flicker
of
firelight
i
gasped
i
believe
i
did
shed
a
few
tears
though
what
for
i
do
know
the
old
grandma
is
a
perfect
old
wretch
over
it
she
lies
chuckling
and
passing
audible
remarks
in
the
next
room
as
pleased
as
punch
really
but
so
mad
because
ma
stainwright
would
have
them
taken
in
to
her
you
should
have
heard
her
when
we
took
them
in
at
last
they
are
both
boys
she
did
make
a
fuss
poor
old
woman
i
think
she
going
a
bit
funny
in
the
head
she
seemed
sometimes
to
think
they
were
hers
and
you
should
have
heard
her
the
way
she
talked
to
them
it
made
me
feel
quite
funny
she
wanted
them
lying
against
her
on
the
pillow
so
that
she
could
feel
them
with
her
face
i
shed
a
few
more
tears
sybil
i
think
i
must
be
going
dotty
also
but
she
came
round
when
we
took
them
away
and
began
to
chuckle
to
herself
and
talk
about
the
things
she
say
to
george
when
he
shocking
things
sybil
made
me
blush
dreadfully
georgie
did
know
about
it
then
he
was
down
at
bingham
buying
some
horses
i
believe
he
seems
to
have
got
a
craze
for
buying
horses
he
got
in
with
harry
jackson
and
mayhew
know
they
were
horse
least
their
father
was
you
remember
he
died
bankrupt
about
three
years
ago
there
are
fred
and
duncan
left
and
they
pretend
to
keep
on
the
old
business
they
are
always
up
at
the
ram
and
georgie
is
always
driving
about
with
them
i
do
like
are
a
loose
lot
rather
common
and
poor
enough
now
well
i
thought
i
wait
and
see
georgie
he
came
about
five
meg
had
been
fidgeting
about
him
wondering
where
he
was
and
how
he
was
and
so
on
bless
me
if
i
worry
and
whittle
about
a
man
the
old
grandma
heard
the
cart
and
before
he
could
get
down
she
know
her
room
is
in
the
george
ma
lad

thy
shins
an
com
an
a
look
at

she
laughed
something
awful
granma
what
art
ter
shoutin
about
he
said
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
meg
turned
to
me
so
pitiful
and
said
he

wi
them
mayhews
gotten
twins
a
couple
at
a
go
ma
lad
shouted
the
old
woman
and
you
know
how
she
gives
squeal
before
she
laughs
she
made
the
horse
shy
and
he
swore
at
it
something
awful
then
bill
took
it
and
georgie
came
upstairs
i
saw
meg
seem
to
shrink
when
she
heard
him
kick
at
the
stairs
as
he
came
up
and
she
went
white
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
came
in
he
fairly
reeked
of
whisky
and
horses
bah
a
man
is
hateful
when
he
reeks
of
drink
he
stood
by
the
side
of
the
bed
grinning
like
a
fool
and
saying
quite
thick
you
bin
in
a
bit
of
a
you
meg
an
how
are
ter
feelin
then
i
a
right
said
meg
it
twins
straight
he
said
is
meg
looked
over
at
the
cradle
and
he
went
round
the
bed
to
it
holding
to
the
he
had
never
kissed
her
nor
anything
when
he
saw
the
twins
asleep
with
their
fists
shut
tight
as
wax
he
gave
a
laugh
as
if
he
was
amused
and
said
two
right
one
on
red
which
is
the
girl
meg
the
black
un
both
boys
said
meg
quite
timidly
he
turned
round
and
his
eyes
went
little
then
he
said
he
stood
there
looking
like
a
devil
sybil
dear
i
did
not
know
our
george
could
look
like
that
i
thought
he
could
only
look
like
a
faithful
dog
or
a
wounded
stag
but
he
looked
fiendish
he
stood
watching
the
poor
little
twins
scowling
at
them
till
at
last
the
little
red
one
began
to
whine
a
bit
ma
stainwright
came
pushing
her
fat
carcass
in
front
of
him
and
bent
over
the
baby
saying
my
pretty
what
are
they
doin
to
thee
what
are
they
are
they
doin
to
thee
georgie
scowled
blacker
than
ever
and
went
out
lurching
against
the
and
making
the
pots
rattle
till
my
heart
jumped
in
my
throat
if
you
do
call
that
said
old
ma
stainwright
and
meg
began
to
cry
you
do
know
cyril
she
sobbed
fit
to
break
her
heart
i
felt
as
if
i
could
have
killed
him
that
old
began
talking
to
him
and
he
laughed
at
her
i
do
hate
to
hear
a
man
laugh
when
he
half
drunk
it
makes
my
blood
boil
all
of
a
sudden
that
old
grandmother
backs
him
up
in
everything
she
a
regular
nuisance
meg
has
cried
to
me
before
over
the
pair
of
them
the
wicked
vulgar
old
thing
that
she
i
went
home
to
woodside
early
in
september
emily
was
staying
at
the
ram
it
was
strange
that
everything
was
so
different
nethermere
even
had
changed
nethermere
was
no
longer
a
complete
wonderful
little
world
that
held
us
charmed
inhabitants
it
was
a
small
insignificant
valley
lost
in
the
spaces
of
the
earth
the
tree
that
had
drooped
over
the
brook
with
such
delightful
romantic
grace
was
a
ridiculous
thing
when
i
came
home
after
a
year
of
absence
in
the
south
the
old
symbols
were
trite
and
foolish
emily
and
i
went
down
one
morning
to
strelley
mill
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
labourer
and
his
wife
strangers
from
the
north
he
was
tall
very
thin
and
silent
strangely
suggesting
kinship
with
the
rats
of
the
place
she
was
small
and
very
active
like
some
ragged
domestic
fowl
run
wild
already
emily
had
visited
her
so
she
invited
us
into
the
kitchen
of
the
mill
and
set
forward
the
chairs
for
us
the
large
room
had
the
barren
air
of
a
cell
there
was
a
small
table
stranded
towards
the
fireplace
and
a
few
chairs
by
the
walls
for
the
rest
desert
spaces
of
flagged
floor
retreating
into
shadow
on
the
walls
by
the
windows
were
five
cages
of
canaries
and
the
small
sharp
movements
of
the
birds
made
the
room
more
strange
in
its
desolation
when
we
began
to
talk
the
birds
began
to
sing
till
we
were
quite
bewildered
for
the
little
woman
spoke
glasgow
scotch
and
she
had
a
hare
lip
she
rose
and
ran
toward
the
cages
crying
herself
like
some
wild
fowl
and
flapping
a
duster
at
the
warbling
canaries
stop
it
stop
it
she
cried
shaking
her
thin
weird
body
at
them
silly
little
devils
fools
fools
fools
and
she
flapped
the
duster
till
the
birds
were
subdued
then
she
brought
us
delicious
scones
and
apple
jelly
urging
us
almost
nudging
us
with
her
thin
elbows
to
make
us
eat
do
you
like
do
you
well
eat
eat
then
go
on
emily
go
on
eat
some
more
only
do
tell
tell
tom
when
comes
in
shook
her
head
and
laughed
her
shrilling
weird
laughter
as
we
were
going
she
came
out
with
us
and
went
running
on
in
front
we
could
not
help
noting
how
ragged
and
unkempt
was
her
short
black
skirt
but
she
hastened
around
us
hither
and
thither
like
an
excited
fowl
talking
in
her
unintelligible
manner
i
could
not
believe
the
brooding
mill
was
in
her
charge
i
could
not
think
this
was
the
strelley
mill
of
a
year
ago
she
fluttered
up
the
steep
orchard
bank
in
front
of
us
happening
to
turn
round
and
see
emily
and
me
smiling
at
each
other
she
began
to
laugh
her
strident
weird
laughter
saying
with
a
leer
emily
he
your
sweetheart
your
sweetheart
emily
you
never
told
me
and
she
laughed
aloud
we
blushed
furiously
she
came
away
from
the
edge
of
the
sluice
gully
nearer
to
us
crying
you
been
here
o
nights
have
you
you
and
she
laughed
again
then
she
sat
down
suddenly
and
pointing
above
our
heads
shrieked
ah
look
there
looked
and
saw
the
mistletoe
look
at
her
look
at
her
how
many
kisses
a
night
emily
ha
kisses
all
the
year
kisses
o
nights
in
a
lonely
place
she
went
on
wildly
for
a
short
time
then
she
dropped
her
voice
and
talked
in
low
pathetic
tones
she
pressed
on
us
scones
and
jelly
and
and
we
left
her
when
we
were
out
on
the
road
by
the
brook
emily
looked
at
me
with
shamefaced
laughing
eyes
i
noticed
a
small
movement
of
her
lips
and
in
an
instant
i
found
myself
kissing
her
laughing
with
some
of
the
little
woman
wildness
chapter
iii
domestic
life
at
the
ram
george
was
very
anxious
to
receive
me
at
his
home
the
ram
had
as
yet
only
a
six
days
licence
so
on
sunday
afternoon
i
walked
over
to
tea
it
was
very
warm
and
still
and
sunny
as
i
came
through
greymede
a
few
sweethearts
were
sauntering
under
the
trees
or
crossing
the
road
to
go
into
the
fields
that
lay
smoothly
carpeted
after
the
as
i
came
round
the
flagged
track
to
the
kitchen
door
of
the
inn
i
heard
the
slur
of
a
baking
tin
and
the
bang
of
the
oven
door
and
meg
saying
crossly
no
do
you
take
him
little
thing
let
his
father
hold
him
one
of
the
babies
was
crying
i
entered
and
found
meg
all
flushed
and
untidy
wearing
a
large
white
apron
just
rising
from
the
oven
emily
in
a
cream
dress
was
taking
a
crying
baby
from
out
of
the
cradle
george
sat
in
the
small
smoking
and
looking
cross
i
ca
shake
hands
said
meg
rather
flurried
i
am
all
floury
sit
down
will
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
emily
looked
up
from
the
complaining
baby
to
me
and
smiled
a
woman
rare
intimate
smile
which
says
see
i
am
engaged
thus
for
a
moment
but
i
keep
my
heart
for
you
all
the
time
george
rose
and
offered
me
the
round
it
was
the
highest
honour
he
could
do
me
he
asked
me
what
i
would
drink
when
i
refused
everything
he
sat
down
heavily
on
the
sofa
frowning
and
angrily
cudgelling
his
wits
for
something
to
vain
the
room
was
large
and
comfortably
furnished
with
a
dresser
a
cupboard
with
glass
doors
perched
on
a
shelf
in
the
corner
and
the
usual
large
sofa
whose
cosy
and
pillows
were
covered
with
red
cotton
stuff
there
was
a
peculiar
reminiscence
of
victuals
and
drink
in
the
room
beer
and
a
touch
of
spirits
and
bacon
teenie
the
sullen
servant
girl
came
in
carrying
the
other
baby
and
meg
called
from
the
scullery
to
ask
her
if
the
child
were
asleep
meg
was
evidently
in
a
bustle
and
a
flurry
a
most
uncomfortable
state
no
replied
teenie
he
not
for
sleep
this
day
mend
the
fire
and
see
to
the
oven
and
then
put
him
his
frock
on
replied
meg
testily
teenie
set
the
baby
in
the
second
cradle
immediately
he
began
to
cry
or
rather
to
shout
his
remonstrance
george
went
across
to
him
and
picked
up
a
white
furry
rabbit
which
he
held
before
the
child
here
look
at
have
your
nice
rabbit
hark
at
it
squeaking
the
baby
listened
for
a
moment
then
deciding
that
this
was
only
a
began
to
cry
again
george
threw
down
the
rabbit
and
took
the
baby
swearing
inwardly
he
dandled
the
child
on
his
knee
what
up
then
up
wi
thee
have
a
ride
but
the
baby
knew
quite
well
what
was
the
father
feeling
towards
him
and
he
continued
to
cry
hurry
up
teenie
said
george
as
the
maid
rattled
the
coal
on
the
fire
emily
was
walking
about
hushing
her
charge
and
smiling
at
me
so
that
i
had
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
gathering
for
myself
the
honey
of
endearment
which
she
shed
on
the
lips
of
the
baby
george
handed
over
his
child
to
the
maid
and
said
to
me
with
patient
sarcasm
will
you
come
in
the
garden
i
rose
and
followed
him
across
the
sunny
flagged
yard
along
the
path
between
the
bushes
he
lit
his
pipe
and
sauntered
along
as
a
man
on
his
own
estate
does
feeling
as
if
he
were
untrammeled
by
laws
or
conventions
you
know
he
said
she
a
dam
rotten
manager
i
laughed
and
remarked
how
full
of
plums
the
trees
were
yes
he
replied
you
know
she
ought
to
have
sent
the
girl
out
with
the
kids
this
afternoon
and
have
got
dressed
directly
but
no
she
must
sit
gossiping
with
emily
all
the
time
they
were
asleep
and
then
as
soon
as
they
wake
up
she
begins
to
make
i
suppose
she
felt
she
enjoy
a
pleasant
chat
all
quiet
i
answered
but
she
knew
quite
well
you
were
coming
and
what
it
would
be
but
a
woman
no
dam
foresight
nay
what
does
it
matter
said
i
sunday
the
only
day
we
can
have
a
bit
of
peace
so
she
might
keep
quiet
then
i
suppose
it
was
the
only
time
too
that
she
could
have
a
quiet
gossip
i
replied
but
you
do
know
he
said
there
seems
to
be
never
a
minute
of
freedom
teenie
sleeps
in
now
and
lives
with
us
in
the
as
i
never
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
moment
private
there
does
seem
a
single
spot
anywhere
where
i
can
sit
quiet
it
the
kids
all
day
and
the
kids
all
night
and
the
servants
and
then
all
the
men
in
the
sometimes
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
get
away
i
shall
leave
the
pub
as
soon
as
i
meg
does
want
to
but
if
you
leave
the
then
i
should
like
to
get
back
on
a
farm
this
is
no
sort
of
a
place
really
for
farming
i
always
got
some
business
on
hand
there
a
traveller
to
see
or
i
got
to
go
to
the
brewers
or
i
somebody
to
look
at
a
horse
or
something
your
life
all
messed
up
if
i
had
a
place
of
my
own
and
farmed
it
in
you
be
as
miserable
as
you
could
be
i
said
perhaps
so
he
assented
in
his
old
reflective
manner
perhaps
so
anyhow
i
need
bother
for
i
feel
as
if
i
never
shall
go
the
land
which
means
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
you
do
intend
to
i
said
laughing
perhaps
so
he
again
yielded
you
see
i
doing
pretty
well
from
the
i
always
think
that
meg
come
and
look
in
the
stable
i
got
a
shire
mare
and
two
nags
pretty
good
i
went
down
to
melton
mowbray
with
tom
mayhew
to
a
chap
they
had
dealings
with
tom
all
right
and
he
knows
how
to
buy
but
he
is
such
a
lazy
careless
devil
too
lazy
to
be
bothered
to
george
was
evidently
interested
as
we
went
round
to
the
stables
emily
came
out
with
the
baby
which
was
dressed
in
a
new
silk
frock
she
advanced
smiling
to
me
with
dark
eyes
see
now
he
is
good
does
he
look
pretty
she
held
the
baby
for
me
to
look
at
i
glanced
at
it
but
i
was
only
conscious
of
the
near
warmth
of
her
cheek
and
of
the
scent
of
her
hair
who
is
he
like
i
asked
looking
up
and
finding
myself
full
in
her
eyes
the
question
was
quite
irrelevant
her
eyes
spoke
a
whole
clear
message
that
made
my
heart
throb
yet
she
answered
who
is
he
why
nobody
of
course
but
he
be
like
father
you
think
the
question
drew
my
eyes
to
hers
again
and
again
we
looked
each
other
the
strange
intelligence
that
made
her
flush
and
me
breathe
in
as
i
smiled
ay
blue
eyes
like
your
like
again
the
wild
messages
in
her
looks
no
she
answered
very
softly
and
i
think
he
be
jolly
like
have
neither
of
them
our
eyes
have
they
no
i
answered
overcome
by
a
sudden
hot
flush
of
tenderness
vulnerable
to
have
such
soft
vulnerable
eyes
as
you
used
makes
one
feel
nervous
and
irascible
but
you
have
clothed
over
the
sensitiveness
of
yours
have
you
naked
life
naked
defenceless
protoplasm
they
were
is
it
not
so
she
laughed
and
at
the
old
painful
memories
she
dilated
in
the
old
way
and
i
felt
the
old
tremor
at
seeing
her
soul
flung
quivering
on
my
pity
and
were
mine
like
that
asked
george
who
had
come
up
he
must
have
perceived
the
bewilderment
of
my
look
as
i
tried
to
adjust
myself
to
him
a
slight
shadow
a
slight
chagrin
appeared
on
his
face
yes
i
answered
not
so
bad
you
never
gave
yourself
away
so
were
most
cautious
but
just
as
defenceless
and
am
i
altered
he
asked
with
quiet
irony
as
if
he
knew
i
was
not
interested
in
him
yes
more
cautious
you
keep
in
the
shadow
but
emily
has
clothed
herself
and
can
now
walk
among
the
crowd
at
her
own
gait
it
was
with
an
effort
i
refrained
from
putting
my
lips
to
kiss
her
at
that
moment
as
she
looked
at
me
with
womanly
dignity
and
tenderness
then
i
remembered
and
said
but
you
are
taking
me
to
the
stable
george
come
and
see
the
horses
too
emily
i
will
i
admire
them
so
much
she
replied
and
thus
we
both
indulged
him
he
talked
to
his
horses
and
of
them
laying
his
hand
upon
them
running
over
their
limbs
the
glossy
restless
animals
interested
him
more
than
anything
he
broke
into
a
little
flush
of
enthusiasm
over
them
they
were
his
new
interest
they
were
quiet
and
yet
responsive
he
was
their
master
and
owner
this
gave
him
real
pleasure
but
the
baby
became
displeased
again
emily
looked
at
me
for
sympathy
with
him
he
is
a
little
wanderer
she
said
he
likes
to
be
always
moving
perhaps
he
objects
to
the
ammonia
of
stables
too
she
added
frowning
and
laughing
slightly
it
is
not
very
agreeable
is
it
not
particularly
i
agreed
and
as
she
moved
off
i
went
with
her
leaving
him
in
the
stables
when
emily
and
i
were
alone
we
sauntered
aimlessly
back
to
the
garden
she
persisted
in
talking
to
the
baby
and
in
talking
to
me
about
the
baby
till
i
wished
the
child
in
jericho
this
made
her
laugh
and
she
continued
to
tantalise
me
the
flowers
of
the
second
whorl
were
flushing
to
the
top
of
the
spires
the
bees
covered
with
pale
crumbs
of
pollen
were
swaying
a
moment
outside
the
wide
gates
of
the
florets
then
they
swung
in
with
excited
hum
and
clung
madly
to
the
fury
white
capitols
and
worked
riotously
round
the
waxy
bases
emily
held
out
the
baby
to
watch
talking
all
the
time
in
low
fond
tones
the
child
stretched
towards
the
bright
flowers
the
sun
glistened
on
his
smooth
hair
as
on
bronze
dust
and
the
wondering
blue
eyes
of
the
baby
followed
the
bees
then
he
made
small
sounds
and
suddenly
waved
his
hands
like
rumpled
pink
buds
look
said
emily
look
at
the
little
bees
ah
but
you
must
touch
them
they
bite
they
coming
she
cried
with
sudden
laughing
apprehension
drawing
the
child
away
he
made
noises
of
remonstrance
she
put
him
near
to
the
flowers
again
till
he
knocked
the
spire
with
his
hand
and
two
indignant
bees
came
sailing
out
emily
drew
back
quickly
crying
in
alarm
then
laughing
with
excited
eyes
at
me
as
if
she
had
just
escaped
a
peril
in
my
presence
thus
she
teased
me
by
flinging
me
all
kinds
of
bright
gages
of
love
while
she
kept
me
aloof
because
of
the
child
she
laughed
with
pure
pleasure
at
this
state
of
affairs
and
delighted
the
more
when
i
frowned
till
at
last
i
swallowed
my
resentment
and
laughed
too
playing
with
the
hands
of
the
baby
and
watching
his
blue
eyes
change
slowly
like
a
softly
sailing
sky
presently
meg
called
us
in
to
tea
she
wore
a
dress
of
fine
blue
stuff
with
cream
silk
embroidery
and
she
looked
handsome
for
her
hair
was
very
hastily
dressed
what
have
you
had
that
child
all
this
time
she
exclaimed
on
seeing
emily
where
is
his
father
i
do
left
him
in
the
stable
did
we
cyril
but
i
like
nursing
him
meg
i
like
it
ever
so
much
replied
emily
oh
yes
you
may
be
sure
george
would
get
off
it
if
he
could
always
in
the
stable
as
i
tell
him
he
fair
stinks
of
horses
he
not
that
fond
of
the
children
i
can
tell
you
come
on
my
come
to
its
mammy
she
took
the
baby
and
kissed
it
passionately
and
made
extravagant
love
to
it
a
clean
shaven
young
man
with
thick
bare
arms
went
across
the
yard
here
just
look
and
tell
george
as
tea
is
ready
said
meg
where
is
he
asked
oswald
the
sturdy
youth
who
attended
to
the
farm
business
you
know
where
to
find
him
replied
meg
with
that
careless
freedom
which
was
so
subtly
derogatory
to
her
husband
george
came
hurrying
from
the
what
is
it
tea
already
he
said
it
a
wonder
you
have
been
crying
out
for
it
this
last
hour
said
meg
it
a
marvel
you
got
dressed
so
quick
he
replied
oh
is
it
she
well
it
not
with
any
of
your
help
that
i
done
it
that
is
a
fact
where
teenie
the
maid
short
stiffly
built
very
dark
and
sullen
looking
came
forward
from
the
gate
can
you
take
alfy
as
well
just
while
we
have
tea
she
asked
teenie
replied
that
she
should
think
she
could
whereupon
she
was
given
the
baby
as
well
as
the
dark
one
she
sat
with
them
on
a
seat
at
the
end
of
the
yard
we
proceeded
to
tea
it
was
a
very
great
spread
there
were
hot
cakes
three
or
four
kinds
of
cold
cakes
tinned
apricots
jellies
tinned
lobster
and
trifles
in
the
way
of
jam
cream
and
rum
i
do
know
what
those
cakes
are
like
said
meg
i
made
them
in
such
a
fluster
really
you
have
to
do
things
as
best
you
can
when
you
got
when
there
two
i
never
seem
to
have
time
to
do
my
hair
up
at
it
now
she
put
up
her
hands
to
her
head
and
i
could
not
help
noticing
how
grimy
and
rough
were
her
nails
the
tea
was
going
on
pleasantly
when
one
of
the
babies
began
to
cry
teenie
bent
over
it
crooning
gruffly
i
leaned
back
and
looked
out
of
the
door
to
watch
her
i
thought
of
the
girl
in
tchekoff
story
who
smothered
her
charge
and
i
hoped
the
grim
teenie
would
not
be
driven
to
such
desperation
the
other
child
joined
in
this
chorus
teenie
rose
from
her
seat
and
walked
about
the
yard
gruffly
trying
to
soothe
the
twins
it
a
funny
thing
but
whenever
anybody
comes
they
sure
to
be
cross
said
meg
beginning
to
simmer
they
no
different
from
ordinary
said
george
it
only
that
you
forced
to
notice
it
then
no
it
is
not
cried
meg
in
a
sudden
passion
is
it
now
emily
of
course
he
has
to
say
something
were
they
as
good
as
gold
this
morning
emily
yesterday
they
never
murmured
as
good
as
gold
they
were
but
he
wants
them
to
be
as
dumb
as
fishes
he
like
them
shutting
up
in
a
box
as
soon
as
they
make
a
bit
of
noise
i
was
not
saying
anything
about
it
he
replied
yes
you
were
she
retorted
i
do
know
what
you
call
it
the
babies
outside
continued
to
cry
bring
alfy
to
me
called
meg
yielding
to
the
mother
feeling
oh
no
damn
it
said
george
let
oswald
take
him
yes
replied
meg
bitterly
let
anybody
take
him
so
long
as
he
out
of
your
sight
you
never
ought
to
have
children
you
george
murmured
something
about
come
then
said
meg
with
a
whole
passion
of
tenderness
as
she
took
the
baby
and
held
it
to
her
bosom
why
what
is
it
then
what
is
it
my
precious
hush
then
pet
hush
then
the
baby
did
not
hush
meg
rose
from
her
chair
and
stood
rocking
the
baby
in
her
arms
swaying
from
one
foot
to
the
other
he
got
a
bit
of
wind
she
said
we
tried
to
continue
the
meal
but
everything
was
awkward
and
difficult
i
wonder
if
he
hungry
said
meg
let
try
him
she
turned
away
and
gave
him
her
breast
then
he
was
still
so
she
covered
herself
as
much
as
she
could
and
sat
down
again
to
tea
we
had
finished
so
we
sat
and
waited
while
she
ate
this
disjointing
of
the
meal
by
reflex
action
made
emily
and
me
more
accurate
we
were
exquisitely
attentive
and
polite
to
a
nicety
our
very
speech
was
clipped
with
precision
as
we
drifted
to
a
discussion
of
strauss
and
debussy
this
of
course
put
a
breach
between
us
two
and
our
hosts
but
we
could
not
help
it
it
was
our
only
way
of
covering
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
occasion
george
sat
looking
glum
and
listening
to
us
meg
was
quite
indifferent
she
listened
occasionally
but
her
position
as
mother
made
her
impregnable
she
sat
eating
calmly
looking
down
now
and
again
at
her
baby
holding
us
in
slight
scorn
babblers
that
we
were
she
was
secure
in
her
high
maternity
she
was
mistress
and
sole
authority
george
as
father
was
first
servant
as
an
indifferent
father
she
humiliated
him
and
was
hostile
to
his
wishes
emily
and
i
were
mere
intruders
feeling
ourselves
such
after
tea
we
went
upstairs
to
wash
our
hands
the
grandmother
had
had
a
second
stroke
of
paralysis
and
lay
inert
almost
stupified
her
large
bulk
upon
the
bed
was
horrible
to
me
and
her
face
with
the
muscles
all
slack
and
awry
seemed
like
some
cruel
cartoon
she
spoke
a
few
thick
words
to
me
george
asked
her
if
she
felt
all
right
or
should
he
rub
her
she
turned
her
old
eyes
slowly
to
him
my
leg
a
bit
she
said
in
her
strange
guttural
he
took
off
his
coat
and
pushing
his
hand
under
the
sat
rubbing
the
poor
old
woman
limb
patiently
slowly
for
some
time
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
then
without
her
turning
her
eyes
from
him
he
passed
out
of
her
vision
and
she
lay
staring
at
nothing
in
his
direction
there
he
said
at
last
is
that
any
better
then
mother
ay
that
a
bit
better
she
said
slowly
should
i
thee
a
drink
he
asked
lingering
wishing
to
minister
all
he
could
to
her
before
he
went
she
looked
at
him
and
he
brought
the
cup
she
swallowed
a
few
drops
with
difficulty
does
it
make
you
miserable
to
have
her
always
there
i
asked
him
when
we
were
in
the
next
room
he
sat
down
on
the
large
white
bed
and
laughed
shortly
we
used
to
never
notice
her
poor
old
but
she
must
have
made
a
difference
to
must
make
a
big
difference
at
the
bottom
even
if
you
do
know
it
i
said
she
got
such
a
strong
character
he
said
musing
seemed
to
understand
me
she
was
a
real
friend
to
me
before
she
was
so
bad
sometimes
i
happen
to
look
at
i
never
see
her
you
know
how
i
sometimes
i
seems
a
bit
he
smiled
at
me
peculiarly
seems
to
take
the
shine
off
things
he
added
and
then
smiling
again
with
ugly
she
our
skeleton
in
the
closet
he
indicated
her
large
bulk
the
church
bells
began
to
ring
the
grey
church
stood
on
a
rise
among
the
fields
not
far
away
like
a
handsome
old
stag
looking
over
towards
the
inn
the
five
bells
began
to
play
and
the
sound
came
beating
upon
the
window
i
hate
sunday
night
he
said
restlessly
because
you
nothing
to
do
i
asked
i
do
know
he
said
it
seems
like
a
gag
and
you
feel
helpless
i
do
want
to
go
to
church
and
hark
at
the
bells
they
make
you
feel
uncomfortable
what
do
you
generally
do
i
asked
feel
been
down
to
mayhew
these
last
two
sundays
and
meg
been
pretty
mad
she
says
it
the
only
night
i
could
stop
with
her
or
go
out
with
her
but
if
i
stop
with
her
what
can
i
do
if
we
go
out
it
only
for
half
an
hour
i
hate
sunday
a
dead
end
when
we
went
downstairs
the
table
was
cleared
and
meg
was
bathing
the
dark
baby
thus
she
was
perfect
she
handled
the
bonny
naked
child
with
beauty
of
gentleness
she
kneeled
over
him
nobly
her
arms
and
her
bosom
and
her
throat
had
a
nobility
of
roundness
and
softness
she
drooped
her
head
with
the
grace
of
a
madonna
and
her
movements
were
lovely
accurate
and
exquisite
like
an
old
song
perfectly
sung
her
voice
playing
and
soothing
round
the
curved
limbs
of
the
baby
was
like
water
soft
as
wine
in
the
sun
running
with
delight
we
watched
humbly
sharing
the
wonder
from
afar
emily
was
very
envious
of
meg
felicity
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
bathe
the
second
baby
meg
granted
her
bounteous
permission
yes
you
can
wash
him
if
you
like
but
what
about
your
frock
emily
delighted
began
to
undress
the
baby
whose
hair
was
like
crocus
petals
her
fingers
trembled
with
pleasure
as
she
loosed
the
little
tapes
i
always
remember
the
inarticulate
delight
with
which
she
took
the
child
in
her
hands
when
at
last
his
little
shirt
was
removed
and
felt
his
soft
white
limbs
and
body
a
distinct
glowing
atmosphere
seemed
suddenly
to
burst
out
around
her
and
the
child
leaving
me
outside
the
moment
before
she
had
been
very
near
to
me
her
eyes
searching
mine
her
spirit
clinging
timidly
about
me
now
i
was
put
away
quite
alone
neglected
forgotten
outside
the
glow
which
surrounded
the
woman
and
the
baby
ha
she
said
with
a
deep
throated
vowel
as
she
put
her
face
against
the
child
small
breasts
so
round
almost
like
a
girl
silken
and
warm
and
wonderful
she
kissed
him
and
touched
him
and
hovered
over
him
drinking
in
his
baby
sweetnesses
the
sweetness
of
the
laughing
little
mouth
wide
wet
kisses
of
the
round
waving
limbs
of
the
little
shoulders
so
winsomely
curving
to
the
arms
and
the
breasts
of
the
tiny
soft
neck
hidden
very
warm
beneath
the
chin
tasting
deliciously
with
her
lips
and
her
cheeks
all
the
exquisite
softness
silkiness
warmth
and
tender
life
of
the
baby
body
a
woman
is
so
ready
to
disclaim
the
body
of
a
man
love
she
yields
him
her
own
soft
beauty
with
so
much
gentle
patience
and
regret
she
clings
to
his
neck
to
his
head
and
his
cheeks
fondling
them
for
the
meaning
that
is
there
and
shrinking
from
his
passionate
limbs
and
his
body
it
was
with
some
perplexity
some
anger
and
bitterness
that
i
watched
emily
moved
almost
to
ecstasy
by
the
baby
small
innocuous
person
meg
never
found
any
pleasure
in
me
as
she
does
in
the
kids
said
george
bitterly
for
himself
the
child
laughing
and
crowing
caught
his
hands
in
emily
hair
and
pulled
dark
tresses
down
while
she
cried
out
in
remonstrance
and
tried
to
loosen
the
small
fists
that
were
shut
so
fast
she
took
him
from
the
water
and
rubbed
him
dry
with
marvellous
gentle
little
rubs
he
kicking
and
expostulating
she
brought
his
fine
hair
into
one
silken
of
ruddy
gold
like
an
aureole
she
played
with
his
tiny
balls
of
toes
like
wee
pink
mushrooms
till
at
last
she
dare
detain
him
no
longer
when
she
put
on
his
flannel
and
his
and
gave
him
to
meg
before
carrying
him
to
bed
meg
took
him
to
feed
him
his
mouth
was
stretched
round
the
nipple
as
he
sucked
his
face
was
pressed
close
and
closer
to
the
breast
his
fingers
wandered
over
the
fine
white
globe
blue
veined
and
heavy
trying
to
hold
it
meg
looked
down
upon
him
with
a
consuming
passion
of
tenderness
and
emily
clasped
her
hands
and
leaned
forward
to
him
even
thus
they
thought
him
exquisite
when
the
twins
were
both
asleep
i
must
tiptoe
upstairs
to
see
them
they
lay
cheek
by
cheek
in
the
crib
next
the
large
white
bed
breathing
little
ruffling
breaths
out
of
unison
so
small
and
pathetic
with
their
tiny
shut
fingers
i
remembered
the
two
larks
from
the
next
room
came
a
heavy
sound
of
the
old
woman
breathing
meg
went
in
to
her
as
in
passing
i
caught
sight
of
the
large
prone
figure
in
the
bed
i
thought
of
guy
de
maupassant
toine
who
acted
as
an
incubator
chapter
iv
the
dominant
motif
of
suffering
the
old
woman
lay
still
another
year
then
she
suddenly
sank
out
of
life
george
ceased
to
write
to
me
but
i
learned
his
news
elsewhere
he
became
more
and
more
intimate
with
the
mayhews
after
old
bankruptcy
the
two
sons
had
remained
on
in
the
large
dark
house
that
stood
off
the
nottingham
road
in
eberwich
this
house
had
been
bequeathed
to
the
oldest
daughter
by
the
mother
maud
mayhew
who
was
married
and
separated
from
her
husband
kept
house
for
her
brothers
she
was
a
tall
large
woman
with
high
and
oily
black
hair
looped
over
her
ears
tom
mayhew
was
also
a
handsome
man
very
dark
and
ruddy
with
insolent
bright
eyes
the
mayhews
house
was
called
the
hollies
it
was
a
solid
building
of
old
red
brick
standing
fifty
yards
back
from
the
eberwich
highroad
between
it
and
the
road
was
an
unkempt
lawn
surrounded
by
very
high
black
holly
trees
the
house
seemed
to
be
imprisoned
among
the
bristling
hollies
passing
through
the
large
gate
one
came
immediately
upon
the
bare
side
of
the
house
and
upon
the
great
range
of
stables
old
mayhew
had
in
his
day
stabled
thirty
or
more
horses
there
now
grass
was
between
the
red
bricks
and
all
the
bleaching
doors
were
shut
save
perhaps
two
or
three
which
were
open
for
george
horses
the
hollies
became
a
kind
of
club
for
the
disconsolate
men
of
the
district
the
large
was
gloomily
and
sparsely
furnished
the
was
a
desert
but
the
smaller
was
comfortable
enough
with
wicker
heavy
curtains
and
a
large
sideboard
in
this
room
george
and
the
mayhews
met
with
several
men
two
or
three
times
a
week
there
they
discussed
horses
and
made
mock
of
the
authority
of
women
george
provided
the
whisky
and
they
all
gambled
timidly
at
cards
these
bachelor
parties
were
the
source
of
great
annoyance
to
the
wives
of
the
married
men
who
attended
them
he
quite
unbearable
when
he
been
at
those
mayhews
said
meg
sure
they
do
nothing
but
cry
us
down
maud
mayhew
kept
apart
from
these
meetings
watching
over
her
two
children
she
had
been
very
unhappily
married
and
now
was
reserved
silent
the
women
of
eberwich
watched
her
as
she
went
swiftly
along
the
street
in
the
morning
with
her
basket
and
they
gloried
a
little
in
her
overthrow
because
she
was
too
proud
to
accept
consolation
yet
they
were
sorry
in
their
hearts
for
her
and
she
was
never
touched
with
calumny
george
saw
her
frequently
but
she
treated
him
coldly
as
she
treated
the
other
men
so
he
was
afraid
of
her
he
had
more
facilities
now
for
his
when
the
grandmother
died
in
the
october
two
years
after
the
marriage
of
george
she
left
him
seven
hundred
pounds
to
meg
she
left
the
inn
and
the
two
houses
she
had
built
in
newerton
together
with
brewery
shares
to
the
value
of
nearly
a
thousand
pounds
george
and
meg
felt
themselves
to
be
people
of
property
the
result
however
was
only
a
little
further
coldness
between
them
he
was
very
careful
that
she
had
all
that
was
hers
she
said
to
him
once
when
they
were
quarrelling
that
he
need
go
feeding
the
mayhews
on
the
money
that
came
out
of
her
business
thenceforward
he
kept
strict
accounts
of
all
his
affairs
and
she
must
audit
them
receiving
her
exact
dues
this
was
a
mortification
to
her
capricious
soul
of
generosity
and
cruelty
the
christmas
after
the
grandmother
death
another
son
was
born
to
them
for
the
time
george
and
meg
became
very
good
friends
again
when
in
the
following
march
i
heard
he
was
coming
down
to
london
with
tom
mayhew
on
business
i
wrote
and
asked
him
to
stay
with
me
meg
replied
saying
she
was
so
glad
i
had
asked
him
she
did
not
want
him
going
off
with
that
fellow
again
he
had
been
such
a
lot
better
lately
and
she
was
sure
it
was
only
those
men
at
mayhew
made
him
what
he
was
he
consented
to
stay
with
me
i
wrote
and
told
him
lettie
and
leslie
were
in
london
and
that
we
should
dine
with
them
one
evening
i
met
him
at
king
cross
and
we
all
three
drove
west
mayhew
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
he
and
george
made
a
notable
couple
they
were
both
in
breeches
and
gaiters
but
george
still
looked
like
a
yeoman
while
mayhew
had
all
the
braggadocio
of
the
stable
we
made
an
impossible
trio
mayhew
laughed
and
jested
broadly
for
a
short
time
then
he
grew
restless
and
fidgety
he
felt
restrained
and
awkward
in
my
presence
later
he
told
george
i
was
a
damned
parson
on
the
other
hand
i
was
content
to
look
at
his
rather
vulgar
teeth
were
blackened
with
to
listen
to
his
ineffectual
talk
but
i
could
find
absolutely
no
response
george
was
to
me
he
was
cautious
and
rather
deferential
to
mayhew
he
was
careless
and
his
attitude
was
tinged
with
contempt
when
the
son
of
the
at
last
left
us
to
go
to
some
of
his
father
old
cronies
we
were
glad
very
uncertain
very
sensitive
and
wavering
our
old
intimacy
burned
again
like
the
fragile
burning
of
alcohol
closed
together
in
the
same
blue
flames
we
discovered
and
watched
the
pageant
of
life
in
the
town
revealed
wonderfully
to
us
we
laughed
at
the
tyranny
of
old
romance
we
scorned
the
faded
procession
of
old
years
and
made
mock
of
the
vast
pilgrimage
of
romances
travelling
farther
into
the
dim
distance
were
we
not
in
the
midst
of
the
bewildering
pageant
of
modern
life
with
all
its
confusion
of
bannerets
and
colours
with
its
infinite
interweaving
of
sounds
the
screech
of
the
modern
toys
of
haste
striking
like
keen
spray
the
heavy
boom
of
busy
mankind
gathering
its
bread
earnestly
forming
the
bed
of
all
other
sounds
and
between
these
two
the
swiftness
of
songs
the
triumphant
tilt
of
the
joy
of
life
the
hoarse
oboes
of
privation
the
shuddering
drums
of
tragedy
and
the
eternal
scraping
of
the
two
strings
of
despair
we
watched
the
taxicabs
coursing
with
their
noses
down
to
the
street
we
watched
the
rocking
hansoms
and
the
lumbering
stateliness
of
buses
in
the
silent
green
cavern
of
the
park
we
stood
and
listened
to
the
surging
of
the
ocean
of
life
we
watched
a
girl
with
streaming
hair
go
galloping
down
the
row
a
dark
man
laughing
and
showing
his
white
teeth
galloping
more
heavily
at
her
elbow
we
saw
a
squad
of
enter
the
gates
of
the
park
erect
and
glittering
with
silver
and
white
and
red
they
came
near
to
us
and
we
thrilled
a
little
as
we
watched
the
muscles
of
their
white
smooth
thighs
answering
the
movement
of
the
horses
and
their
cheeks
and
their
chins
bending
with
proud
manliness
to
the
rhythm
of
the
march
we
watched
the
exquisite
rhythm
of
the
body
of
men
moving
in
scarlet
and
silver
further
down
the
leafless
avenue
like
a
slightly
wavering
spark
of
red
life
blown
along
at
the
marble
arch
corner
we
listened
to
a
little
socialist
who
was
flaring
fiercely
under
a
plane
tree
the
hot
stream
of
his
words
flowed
over
the
old
wounds
that
the
knowledge
of
the
unending
miseries
of
the
poor
had
given
me
and
i
winced
for
him
the
world
was
all
and
all
the
was
as
a
pool
from
which
the
waters
are
drained
off
leaving
the
to
wrestle
in
the
wet
mud
under
the
sun
till
the
whole
of
the
city
seems
a
heaving
shuddering
struggle
of
objects
deprived
of
the
elements
of
life
i
felt
a
great
terror
of
the
little
man
lest
he
should
make
me
see
all
mud
as
i
had
seen
before
then
i
felt
a
breathless
pity
for
him
that
his
eyes
should
be
always
filled
with
mud
and
never
brightened
george
listened
intently
to
the
speaker
very
much
moved
by
him
at
night
after
the
theatre
we
saw
the
outcasts
sleep
in
a
rank
under
the
waterloo
bridge
their
heads
to
the
wall
their
feet
lying
out
on
the
pavement
a
long
black
ruffled
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
all
the
faces
were
covered
but
two
that
of
a
peaked
pale
little
man
and
that
of
a
brutal
woman
over
these
two
faces
floating
like
uneasy
pale
dreams
on
their
obscurity
swept
now
and
again
the
trailing
light
of
the
tram
cars
we
picked
our
way
past
the
line
of
abandoned
feet
shrinking
from
the
sight
of
the
thin
bare
ankles
of
a
young
man
from
the
draggled
edge
of
the
skirts
of
a
woman
from
the
pitiable
sight
of
the
men
who
had
wrapped
their
legs
in
newspaper
for
a
little
warmth
and
lay
like
worthless
parcels
it
was
raining
some
men
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
causeway
fixed
in
dreary
misery
finding
no
room
to
sleep
outside
on
a
seat
in
the
blackness
and
the
rain
a
woman
sat
sleeping
while
the
water
trickled
and
hung
heavily
at
the
ends
of
her
loosened
strands
of
hair
her
hands
were
pushed
in
the
bosom
of
her
jacket
she
lurched
forward
in
her
sleep
started
and
one
of
her
hands
fell
out
of
her
bosom
she
sank
again
to
sleep
george
gripped
my
arm
give
her
something
he
whispered
in
panic
i
was
afraid
then
suddenly
getting
a
florin
from
my
pocket
i
stiffened
my
nerves
and
slid
it
into
her
palm
her
hand
was
soft
and
warm
and
curled
in
sleep
she
started
violently
looking
up
at
me
then
down
at
her
hand
i
turned
my
face
aside
terrified
lest
she
should
look
in
my
eyes
and
full
of
shame
and
grief
i
ran
down
the
embankment
to
him
we
hurried
along
under
the
plane
trees
in
silence
the
shining
cars
were
drawing
tall
in
the
distance
over
westminster
bridge
a
fainter
yellow
light
running
with
them
on
the
water
below
the
wet
streets
were
spilled
with
golden
liquor
of
light
and
on
the
deep
blackness
of
the
river
were
the
restless
yellow
slashes
of
the
lamps
lettie
and
leslie
were
staying
up
at
hampstead
with
a
friend
of
the
tempests
one
of
the
largest
shareholders
in
the
firm
of
tempest
wharton
co
the
raphaels
had
a
substantial
house
and
lettie
preferred
to
go
to
them
rather
than
to
an
hotel
especially
as
she
had
brought
with
her
her
infant
son
now
ten
months
old
with
his
nurse
they
invited
george
and
me
to
dinner
on
the
friday
evening
the
party
included
lettie
host
and
hostess
and
also
a
scottish
poetess
and
an
irish
musician
composer
of
songs
and
pianoforte
rhapsodies
lettie
wore
a
black
lace
dress
in
mourning
for
one
of
leslie
maternal
aunts
this
made
her
look
older
otherwise
there
seemed
to
be
no
change
in
her
a
subtle
observer
might
have
noticed
a
little
hardness
about
her
mouth
and
disillusion
hanging
slightly
on
her
eyes
she
was
however
excited
by
the
company
in
which
she
found
herself
therefore
she
overflowed
with
clever
speeches
and
rapid
brilliant
observations
certainly
on
such
occasions
she
was
admirable
the
rest
of
the
company
formed
as
it
were
the
orchestra
which
accompanied
her
george
was
exceedingly
quiet
he
spoke
a
few
words
now
and
then
to
mrs
raphael
but
on
the
whole
he
was
altogether
silent
listening
really
lettie
was
saying
i
do
see
that
one
thing
is
worth
doing
any
more
than
another
it
like
dessert
you
are
equally
indifferent
whether
you
have
grapes
or
pears
or
pineapple
have
you
already
dined
so
far
sang
the
scottish
poetess
in
her
musical
plaintive
manner
the
only
thing
worth
doing
is
producing
said
lettie
alas
that
is
what
all
the
young
folk
are
saying
nowadays
sighed
the
irish
musician
that
is
the
only
thing
one
finds
any
pleasure
is
to
say
any
satisfaction
continued
lettie
smiling
and
turning
to
the
two
artists
do
you
not
think
so
she
added
you
do
come
to
a
point
at
last
said
the
scottish
poetess
when
your
work
is
a
real
source
of
satisfaction
do
you
write
poetry
then
asked
george
of
lettie
i
oh
dear
no
i
have
tried
strenuously
to
make
up
a
limerick
for
a
competition
but
in
vain
so
you
see
i
am
a
failure
there
did
you
know
i
have
a
son
though
marvellous
little
fellow
is
he
not
leslie
is
my
work
i
am
a
wonderful
mother
am
i
not
leslie
too
devoted
he
replied
there
she
exclaimed
in
when
i
have
to
sign
my
name
and
occupation
in
a
visitor
book
it
will
be
i
hope
my
business
will
flourish
she
concluded
smiling
there
was
a
touch
of
ironical
brutality
in
her
now
she
was
at
the
bottom
quite
sincere
having
reached
that
point
in
a
woman
career
when
most
perhaps
all
of
the
things
in
life
seem
worthless
and
insipid
she
had
determined
to
put
up
with
it
to
ignore
her
own
self
to
empty
her
own
potentialities
into
the
vessel
of
another
or
others
and
to
live
her
life
at
second
hand
this
peculiar
abnegation
of
self
is
the
resource
of
a
woman
for
the
escaping
of
the
responsibilities
of
her
own
development
like
a
nun
she
puts
over
her
living
face
a
veil
as
a
sign
that
the
woman
no
longer
exists
for
herself
she
is
the
servant
of
god
of
some
man
of
her
children
or
may
be
of
some
cause
as
a
servant
she
is
no
longer
responsible
for
her
self
which
would
make
her
terrified
and
lonely
service
is
light
and
easy
to
be
responsible
for
the
good
progress
of
one
life
is
terrifying
it
is
the
most
insufferable
form
of
loneliness
and
the
heaviest
of
responsibilities
so
lettie
indulged
her
husband
but
did
not
yield
her
independence
to
him
rather
it
was
she
who
took
much
of
the
responsibility
of
him
into
her
hands
and
therefore
he
was
so
devoted
to
her
she
had
however
now
determined
to
abandon
the
charge
of
herself
to
serve
her
children
when
the
children
grew
up
either
they
would
unconsciously
fling
her
away
back
upon
herself
again
in
bitterness
and
loneliness
or
they
would
tenderly
cherish
her
chafing
at
her
occasionally
george
looked
and
listened
to
all
the
flutter
of
conversation
and
said
nothing
it
seemed
to
him
like
so
much
unreasonable
rustling
of
pieces
of
paper
of
leaves
of
books
and
so
on
later
in
the
evening
lettie
sang
no
longer
italian
folk
songs
but
the
fragmentary
utterances
of
debussy
and
strauss
these
also
to
george
were
quite
meaningless
and
rather
wearisome
it
made
him
impatient
to
see
her
wasting
herself
upon
them
do
you
like
those
songs
she
asked
in
the
frank
careless
manner
she
affected
not
much
he
replied
ungraciously
do
you
she
exclaimed
adding
with
a
smile
those
are
the
most
wonderful
things
in
the
world
those
little
things
began
to
hum
a
debussy
idiom
he
could
not
answer
her
on
the
point
so
he
sat
with
the
arrow
sticking
in
him
and
did
not
speak
she
enquired
of
him
concerning
meg
and
his
children
and
the
affairs
of
eberwich
but
the
interest
was
flimsy
as
she
preserved
a
wide
distance
between
them
although
apparently
she
was
so
unaffected
and
friendly
we
left
before
eleven
when
we
were
seated
in
the
cab
and
rushing
down
hill
he
said
you
know
she
makes
me
mad
he
was
frowning
looking
out
of
the
window
away
from
me
who
lettie
why
what
riles
you
i
asked
he
was
some
time
in
replying
why
she
so
affected
i
sat
still
in
the
small
close
space
and
waited
do
you
he
laughed
keeping
his
face
averted
from
me
she
makes
my
blood
boil
i
could
hate
her
why
i
said
gently
i
do
know
i
feel
as
if
she
insulted
me
she
does
lie
she
i
did
notice
it
i
said
but
i
knew
he
meant
her
shirking
her
shuffling
of
her
life
and
you
think
of
those
poor
devils
under
the
then
of
her
and
them
frittering
away
themselves
and
money
in
that
he
spoke
with
passion
you
are
quoting
longfellow
i
said
what
he
asked
looking
at
me
suddenly
is
real
life
is
he
flushed
slightly
at
my
gibe
i
do
know
what
it
is
he
replied
but
it
a
pretty
rotten
business
when
you
think
of
her
fooling
about
wasting
herself
and
all
the
waste
that
goes
on
up
there
and
the
poor
devils
rotting
on
the
and
i
continued
he
looked
at
me
very
intently
to
see
if
i
were
mocking
he
laughed
i
could
see
he
was
very
much
moved
is
the
time
quite
out
of
joint
i
asked
why
laughed
no
but
she
makes
me
feel
so
if
i
should
do
know
when
i
felt
in
such
a
rage
i
wonder
why
i
sorry
for
him
poor
devil
and
seemed
christened
for
one
another
did
they
what
if
you
had
her
i
asked
we
should
have
been
like
a
cat
and
dog
i
rather
be
with
meg
a
thousand
he
added
significantly
he
sat
watching
the
lamps
and
the
people
and
the
dark
buildings
slipping
past
us
shall
we
go
and
have
a
drink
i
asked
him
thinking
we
would
call
in
frascati
to
see
the
i
could
do
with
a
brandy
he
replied
looking
at
me
slowly
we
sat
in
the
restaurant
listening
to
the
jigging
of
the
music
watching
the
changing
flow
of
the
people
i
like
to
sit
a
long
time
by
the
hollyhocks
watching
the
throng
of
varied
bees
which
poise
and
hesitate
outside
the
wild
flowers
then
swing
in
with
a
hum
which
sets
everything
aquiver
but
still
more
fascinating
it
is
to
watch
the
come
and
go
of
people
weaving
and
intermingling
in
the
complex
mesh
of
their
intentions
with
all
the
subtle
grace
and
mystery
of
their
moving
shapely
bodies
i
sat
still
looking
out
across
the
amphitheatre
george
looked
also
but
he
drank
glass
after
glass
of
brandy
i
like
to
watch
the
people
said
i
does
it
seem
an
aimless
idiotic
at
them
he
replied
in
tones
of
contempt
i
looked
instead
at
him
in
some
surprise
and
resentment
his
face
was
gloomy
stupid
and
unrelieved
the
amount
of
brandy
he
had
drunk
had
increased
his
ill
humour
shall
we
be
going
i
said
i
did
not
want
him
to
get
drunk
in
his
present
state
of
mind
half
a
minute
he
finished
the
brandy
and
rose
although
he
had
drunk
a
good
deal
he
was
quite
steady
only
there
was
a
disagreeable
look
always
on
his
face
and
his
eyes
seemed
smaller
and
more
glittering
than
i
had
seen
them
we
took
a
bus
to
victoria
he
sat
swaying
on
his
seat
in
the
dim
clumsy
vehicle
saying
not
a
word
in
the
vast
cavern
of
the
station
the
were
hastening
crossing
the
pale
grey
strand
small
creatures
scurrying
hither
and
thither
in
the
space
beneath
the
lonely
lamps
as
the
train
crawled
over
the
river
we
watched
the
hoop
of
diamond
lights
curving
slowly
round
and
striping
with
bright
threads
the
black
water
he
sat
looking
with
heavy
eyes
seeming
to
shrink
from
the
enormous
unintelligible
lettering
of
the
poem
of
london
the
town
was
too
large
for
him
he
could
not
take
in
its
immense
its
stupendous
poetry
what
did
come
home
to
him
was
its
flagrant
discords
the
unintelligibility
of
the
vast
city
made
him
apprehensive
and
the
crudity
of
its
big
coarse
contrasts
wounded
him
unutterably
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
him
as
we
went
along
the
silent
pavement
at
norwood
nothing
he
replied
nothing
and
i
did
not
trouble
him
further
we
occupied
a
large
looked
down
the
hill
and
over
to
the
far
woods
of
kent
he
was
morose
and
untalkative
i
brought
up
a
and
whisky
and
we
proceeded
to
undress
when
he
stood
in
his
pajamas
he
waited
as
if
uncertain
do
you
want
a
drink
he
asked
i
did
not
he
crossed
to
the
table
and
as
i
got
into
my
bed
i
heard
the
brief
fizzing
of
the
syphon
he
drank
his
glass
at
one
draught
then
switched
off
the
light
in
the
sudden
darkness
i
saw
his
pale
shadow
go
across
to
the
sofa
in
the
the
blinds
were
undrawn
and
the
stars
looked
in
he
gazed
out
on
the
great
bay
of
darkness
wherein
far
away
and
below
floated
a
few
sparks
of
lamps
like
herring
boats
at
sea
are
you
coming
to
bed
i
asked
i
not
go
to
sleep
he
answered
resenting
having
to
speak
at
all
then
put
on
a
dressing
one
in
that
the
light
on
he
did
not
answer
but
fumbled
for
the
garment
in
the
darkness
when
he
had
found
it
he
said
do
you
mind
if
i
smoke
i
did
not
he
fumbled
again
in
his
pockets
for
cigarettes
always
refusing
to
switch
on
the
light
i
watched
his
face
bowed
to
the
match
as
he
lighted
his
cigarette
he
was
still
handsome
in
the
ruddy
light
but
his
features
were
coarser
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
but
i
saw
that
i
could
get
no
nearer
to
him
to
relieve
him
for
some
time
i
lay
in
the
darkness
watching
the
end
of
his
cigarette
like
a
ruddy
malignant
insect
hovering
near
his
lips
putting
the
timid
stars
immensely
far
away
he
sat
quite
still
leaning
on
the
sofa
arm
occasionally
there
was
a
little
glow
on
his
cheeks
as
the
cigarette
burned
brighter
then
again
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
dull
red
bee
i
suppose
i
must
have
dropped
asleep
suddenly
i
started
as
something
fell
to
the
floor
i
heard
him
cursing
under
his
breath
what
the
matter
i
asked
i
only
knocked
something
case
or
something
he
replied
apologetically
are
you
coming
to
bed
i
asked
yes
i
coming
he
answered
quite
docile
he
seemed
to
wander
about
and
knock
against
things
as
he
came
he
dropped
heavily
into
bed
are
you
sleepy
now
i
asked
i
shall
be
directly
he
replied
what
up
with
you
i
asked
i
dunno
he
answered
i
am
like
this
sometimes
when
there
nothing
i
want
to
do
and
nowhere
i
want
to
go
and
nobody
i
want
to
be
near
then
you
feel
so
rottenly
lonely
cyril
you
feel
awful
like
a
vacuum
with
a
pressure
on
you
a
sort
of
pressure
of
darkness
and
you
nothing
a
what
it
little
vacuum
that
not
dark
all
loose
in
the
middle
of
a
space
of
darkness
pressing
on
you
good
gracious
i
exclaimed
rousing
myself
in
bed
that
sounds
bad
he
laughed
slightly
it
all
right
he
said
it
only
the
excitement
of
london
and
that
little
man
in
the
park
and
that
woman
on
the
wonder
where
she
is
poor
then
lettie
i
seem
thrown
off
my
think
really
i
ought
to
have
made
something
of
what
i
asked
as
he
hesitated
i
do
know
he
replied
slowly
poet
or
something
like
do
know
i
shall
laugh
at
myself
for
thinking
so
but
i
am
born
a
generation
too
was
ripe
enough
when
i
came
i
wanted
something
i
had
got
i
something
short
i
like
corn
in
a
wet
but
pappy
no
good
is
rot
i
came
too
soon
or
i
wanted
something
that
would
ha
made
me
grow
fierce
that
why
i
wanted
think
but
am
i
talking
damn
rot
what
am
i
saying
what
are
you
making
me
talk
for
what
are
you
listening
for
i
rose
and
went
across
to
him
saying
i
do
want
you
to
talk
if
you
sleep
till
morning
things
will
look
different
i
sat
on
his
bed
and
took
his
hand
he
lay
quite
still
i
only
a
kid
after
all
cyril
he
said
a
few
moments
later
we
all
are
i
answered
still
holding
his
hand
presently
he
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
the
sunlight
was
laughing
with
the
young
morning
in
the
room
the
large
blue
sky
shone
against
the
window
and
the
birds
were
calling
in
the
garden
below
shouting
to
one
another
and
making
fun
of
life
i
felt
glad
to
have
opened
my
eyes
i
lay
for
a
moment
looking
out
on
the
morning
as
on
a
blue
bright
sea
in
which
i
was
going
to
plunge
then
my
eyes
wandered
to
the
little
table
near
the
couch
i
noticed
the
glitter
of
george
cigarette
case
and
then
with
a
start
the
whisky
decanter
it
was
nearly
empty
he
must
have
drunk
of
a
pint
of
liquor
while
i
was
dozing
i
could
not
believe
it
i
thought
i
must
have
been
mistaken
as
to
the
quantity
the
bottle
contained
i
leaned
out
to
see
what
it
was
that
had
startled
me
by
its
fall
the
night
before
it
was
the
large
heavy
drinking
glass
which
he
had
knocked
down
but
not
broken
i
could
see
no
stain
on
the
carpet
george
was
still
asleep
he
lay
half
uncovered
and
was
breathing
quietly
his
face
looked
inert
like
a
mask
the
pallid
uninspired
clay
of
his
features
seemed
to
have
sunk
a
little
out
of
shape
so
that
he
appeared
rather
haggard
rather
ugly
with
grooves
of
ineffectual
misery
along
his
cheeks
i
wanted
him
to
wake
so
that
his
inert
flaccid
features
might
be
inspired
with
life
again
i
could
not
believe
his
charm
and
his
beauty
could
have
forsaken
him
so
and
left
his
features
dreary
sunken
clay
as
i
looked
he
woke
his
eyes
opened
slowly
he
looked
at
me
and
turned
away
unable
to
meet
my
eyes
he
pulled
the
bedclothes
up
over
his
shoulders
as
though
to
cover
himself
from
me
and
he
lay
with
his
back
to
me
quite
still
as
if
he
were
asleep
although
i
knew
he
was
quite
awake
he
was
suffering
the
humiliation
of
lying
waiting
for
his
life
to
crawl
back
and
inhabit
his
body
as
it
was
his
vitality
was
not
yet
sufficient
to
inform
the
muscles
of
his
face
and
give
him
an
expression
much
less
to
answer
by
challenge
chapter
v
pisgah
when
her
eldest
boy
was
three
years
old
lettie
returned
to
live
at
eberwich
old
tempest
died
suddenly
so
leslie
came
down
to
inhabit
highclose
he
was
a
very
much
occupied
man
very
often
he
was
in
germany
or
in
the
south
of
england
engaged
on
business
at
home
he
was
unfailingly
attentive
to
his
wife
and
his
two
children
he
had
cultivated
a
taste
for
public
life
in
spite
of
his
pressure
of
business
he
had
become
a
county
councillor
and
one
of
the
prominent
members
of
the
conservative
association
he
was
very
fond
of
answering
or
proposing
toasts
at
some
public
dinner
of
entertaining
political
men
at
highclose
of
taking
the
chair
at
political
meetings
and
finally
of
speaking
on
this
or
that
platform
his
name
was
fairly
often
seen
in
the
newspapers
as
a
mine
owner
he
spoke
as
an
authority
on
the
employment
of
labour
on
royalties
and
so
on
at
home
he
was
quite
tame
he
treated
his
wife
with
respect
romped
in
the
nursery
and
domineered
the
servants
royally
they
liked
him
for
they
did
not
like
he
was
noisy
but
unobservant
she
was
quiet
and
exacting
he
would
swear
and
bluster
furiously
but
when
he
was
round
the
corner
they
smiled
she
gave
her
orders
and
passed
very
moderate
censure
but
they
went
away
cursing
to
themselves
as
lettie
was
always
a
very
good
wife
leslie
adored
her
when
he
had
the
time
and
when
he
had
not
forgot
her
comfortably
she
was
very
contradictory
at
times
she
would
write
to
me
in
terms
of
passionate
dissatisfaction
she
had
nothing
at
all
in
her
life
it
was
a
barren
futility
i
hope
i
shall
have
another
child
next
spring
she
would
write
there
is
only
that
to
take
away
the
misery
of
this
torpor
i
seem
full
of
passion
and
energy
and
it
all
fizzles
out
in
day
to
day
when
i
replied
to
her
urging
her
to
take
some
work
that
she
could
throw
her
soul
into
she
would
reply
indifferently
then
later
you
charge
me
with
contradiction
well
naturally
you
see
i
wrote
that
screeching
letter
in
a
mood
which
wo
come
again
for
some
time
generally
i
am
quite
content
to
take
the
rain
and
the
calm
days
just
as
they
come
then
something
flings
me
out
of
i
am
a
trifle
demented
very
blue
as
i
tell
leslie
like
so
many
women
she
seemed
to
live
for
the
most
part
contentedly
a
small
indoor
existence
with
artificial
light
and
padded
upholstery
only
occasionally
hearing
the
winds
of
life
outside
she
clamoured
to
be
out
in
the
black
keen
storm
she
was
driven
to
the
door
she
looked
out
and
called
into
the
tumult
wildly
but
feminine
caution
kept
her
from
stepping
over
the
threshold
george
was
flourishing
in
his
in
the
morning
processions
of
splendid
shire
horses
tied
tail
and
head
would
tramp
grandly
along
the
quiet
lanes
of
eberwich
led
by
george
man
or
by
tom
mayhew
while
in
the
fresh
clean
sunlight
george
would
go
riding
by
two
restless
nags
dancing
beside
him
when
i
came
home
from
france
five
years
after
our
meeting
in
london
i
found
him
installed
in
the
hollies
he
had
rented
the
house
from
the
mayhews
and
had
moved
there
with
his
family
leaving
oswald
in
charge
of
the
ram
i
called
at
the
large
house
one
afternoon
but
george
was
out
his
family
surprised
me
the
twins
were
tall
lads
of
six
there
were
two
more
boys
and
meg
was
nursing
a
beautiful
about
a
year
old
this
child
was
evidently
mistress
of
the
household
meg
who
was
growing
stouter
indulged
the
little
creature
in
every
way
how
is
george
i
asked
her
oh
he
very
well
she
replied
he
always
got
something
on
hand
he
hardly
seems
to
have
a
spare
moment
what
with
his
socialism
and
one
thing
and
another
it
was
true
the
outcome
of
his
visit
to
london
had
been
a
wild
devotion
to
the
cause
of
the
i
saw
a
picture
of
watt
mammon
on
the
walls
of
the
and
the
works
of
blatchford
masterman
and
chiozza
money
on
the
side
table
the
socialists
of
the
district
used
to
meet
every
other
thursday
evening
at
the
hollies
to
discuss
reform
meg
did
not
care
for
these
earnest
souls
they
not
my
sort
she
said
too
jerky
and
bumptious
they
think
everybody
but
them
there
one
thing
about
them
though
they
do
drink
so
that
a
blessing
why
i
said
have
you
had
much
trouble
that
way
she
lowered
her
voice
to
a
pitch
which
was
sufficiently
mysterious
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
boys
i
should
say
anything
if
it
was
that
you
were
like
brothers
she
said
but
he
did
begin
to
have
dreadful
drinking
bouts
you
know
it
was
always
spirits
and
generally
brandy
that
makes
such
work
with
them
you
no
idea
what
he
like
when
he
sometimes
all
for
talk
sometimes
he
laughing
at
everything
and
sometimes
just
snappy
and
here
her
tones
grew
ominous
come
home
at
the
memory
she
grew
serious
you
could
imagine
what
it
like
cyril
she
said
it
like
having
satan
in
the
house
with
you
or
a
black
tiger
glowering
at
you
i
sure
nobody
knows
what
i
suffered
with
the
children
stood
with
large
awful
eyes
and
paling
lips
listening
but
he
better
now
i
said
oh
gertie
came
looked
fondly
at
the
baby
in
her
he
a
lot
better
now
you
see
he
always
wanted
a
girl
and
very
fond
of
he
pet
you
your
dadda
girlie
mamma
too
are
you
the
baby
turned
with
sudden
coy
shyness
and
clung
to
her
mother
neck
meg
kissed
her
fondly
then
the
child
laid
her
cheek
against
her
mother
the
mother
dark
eyes
and
the
baby
large
hazel
eyes
looked
at
me
serenely
the
two
were
very
calm
very
complete
and
triumphant
together
in
their
completeness
was
a
security
which
made
me
feel
alone
and
ineffectual
a
woman
who
has
her
child
in
her
arms
is
a
tower
of
strength
a
beautiful
unassailable
tower
of
strength
that
may
in
its
turn
stand
quietly
dealing
death
i
told
meg
i
would
call
again
to
see
george
two
evenings
later
i
asked
lettie
to
lend
me
a
to
drive
over
to
the
hollies
leslie
was
away
on
one
of
his
political
jaunts
and
she
was
restless
she
proposed
to
go
with
me
she
had
called
on
meg
twice
before
in
the
new
large
home
we
started
about
six
the
night
was
dark
and
muddy
lettie
wanted
to
call
in
eberwich
village
so
she
drove
the
long
way
round
selsby
the
horse
was
walking
through
the
gate
of
the
hollies
at
about
seven
meg
was
upstairs
in
the
nursery
the
maid
told
me
and
george
was
in
the
getting
baby
to
sleep
all
right
i
said
we
will
go
in
to
him
do
bother
to
tell
him
as
we
stood
in
the
gloomy
square
hall
we
heard
the
rumble
of
a
the
stroke
coming
slow
and
heavy
to
the
tune
of
henry
martin
one
of
our
strelley
mill
folk
songs
then
through
the
singing
floated
the
long
light
crooning
of
the
baby
as
she
sang
in
her
quaint
little
fashion
a
mischievous
second
to
her
father
lullaby
he
waxed
a
little
louder
and
without
knowing
why
we
found
ourselves
smiling
with
piquant
amusement
the
baby
grew
louder
too
till
there
was
a
shrill
ring
of
laughter
and
mockery
in
her
music
he
sang
louder
and
louder
the
baby
shrilled
higher
and
higher
the
chair
swung
in
long
heavy
beats
then
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
the
rocking
stopped
and
he
said
still
with
laughter
and
enjoyment
in
his
tones
now
that
is
very
wicked
ah
naughty
to
boh
go
to
bohey
once
the
baby
chuckled
her
small
insolent
mockery
come
mamma
he
said
come
and
take
girlie
to
bohey
the
baby
laughed
again
but
with
an
uncertain
touch
of
appeal
in
her
tone
we
opened
the
door
and
entered
he
looked
up
very
much
startled
to
see
us
he
was
sitting
in
a
tall
by
the
fire
coatless
with
white
shirtsleeves
the
baby
in
her
tight
little
stood
on
his
knee
her
wide
eyes
fixed
on
us
wild
wisps
of
her
brown
hair
brushed
across
her
forehead
and
glinting
like
puffs
of
bronze
dust
over
her
ears
quickly
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
tucked
her
face
under
his
chin
her
small
feet
poised
on
his
thigh
the
dropping
upon
them
he
shook
his
head
as
the
puff
of
soft
brown
hair
tickled
him
he
smiled
at
us
saying
you
see
i
busy
then
he
turned
again
to
the
little
brown
head
tucked
under
his
chin
blew
away
the
luminous
cloud
of
hair
and
rubbed
his
lips
and
his
moustache
on
the
small
white
neck
so
warm
and
secret
the
baby
put
up
her
shoulders
and
shrank
a
little
bubbling
in
his
neck
with
hidden
laughter
she
did
not
lift
her
face
or
loosen
her
arms
she
thinks
she
is
shy
he
said
look
up
young
hussy
and
see
the
lady
and
gentleman
she
is
a
positive
owl
she
wo
go
to
you
young
he
tickled
her
neck
again
with
his
moustache
and
the
child
bubbled
over
with
naughty
merry
laughter
the
room
was
very
warm
with
a
red
bank
of
fire
up
the
chimney
mouth
it
was
half
lighted
from
a
heavy
bronze
chandelier
black
and
gloomy
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
was
the
same
sombre
sparse
furniture
that
the
mayhews
had
had
george
looked
large
and
handsome
the
glossy
black
silk
of
his
waistcoat
fitting
close
to
his
sides
the
roundness
of
the
shoulder
muscle
filling
the
white
linen
of
his
sleeves
suddenly
the
baby
lifted
her
head
and
stared
at
us
thrusting
into
her
mouth
the
dummy
that
was
pinned
to
the
breast
of
her
the
faded
pink
sleeves
of
the
were
tight
on
her
fat
little
wrists
she
stood
thus
sucking
her
dummy
one
arm
round
her
neck
watching
us
with
hazel
solemn
eyes
then
she
pushed
her
fat
little
fist
up
among
the
bush
of
small
curls
and
began
to
twist
her
fingers
about
her
ear
that
was
white
like
a
camelia
flower
she
is
really
sleepy
said
lettie
come
then
said
he
folding
her
for
sleep
against
his
breast
come
and
go
to
boh
but
the
young
rascal
immediately
began
to
cry
her
remonstrance
she
stiffened
herself
freed
herself
and
stood
again
on
his
knee
watching
us
solemnly
vibrating
the
dummy
in
her
mouth
as
she
suddenly
sucked
at
it
twisting
her
father
ear
in
her
small
fingers
till
he
winced
her
nails
sharp
he
said
smiling
he
began
asking
and
giving
the
small
information
that
pass
between
friends
who
have
not
met
for
a
long
time
the
baby
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
keeping
her
tired
eyes
fixed
darkly
on
us
then
gradually
the
lids
fluttered
and
sank
and
she
dropped
on
to
his
arm
she
is
asleep
whispered
lettie
immediately
the
dark
eyes
opened
again
we
looked
significantly
at
one
another
continuing
our
subdued
talk
after
a
while
the
baby
slept
soundly
presently
meg
came
downstairs
she
greeted
us
in
breathless
whispers
of
surprise
and
then
turned
to
her
husband
has
she
gone
she
whispered
bending
over
the
sleeping
child
in
astonishment
my
this
is
wonderful
is
it
she
took
the
sleeping
drooping
baby
from
his
arms
putting
her
mouth
close
to
its
forehead
murmuring
with
soothing
inarticulate
sounds
we
stayed
talking
for
some
time
when
meg
had
put
the
baby
to
bed
george
had
a
new
tone
of
assurance
and
authority
in
the
first
place
he
was
an
established
man
living
in
a
large
house
having
altogether
three
men
working
for
him
in
the
second
place
he
had
ceased
to
value
the
conventional
treasures
of
social
position
and
ostentatious
refinement
very
very
many
things
he
condemned
as
flummery
and
sickly
waste
of
time
the
life
of
an
ordinary
person
he
set
down
as
adorned
futility
almost
idiocy
he
spoke
passionately
of
the
monstrous
denial
of
life
to
the
many
by
the
fortunate
few
he
talked
at
lettie
most
flagrantly
of
course
she
said
i
have
read
wells
and
shaw
and
even
niel
lyons
and
a
is
his
name
querido
but
what
can
i
do
i
think
the
rich
have
as
much
misery
as
the
poor
and
of
quite
as
deadly
a
sort
what
can
i
do
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
the
development
of
the
human
race
society
and
its
regulations
is
not
a
sort
of
drill
that
endless
napoleons
have
forced
on
us
it
is
the
only
way
we
have
yet
found
of
living
together
pah
said
he
that
is
rank
cowardice
it
is
feeble
and
futile
to
the
last
degree
we
ca
grow
in
a
generation
nor
can
we
grow
we
can
begin
to
take
active
measures
he
replied
contemptuously
we
can
all
go
into
a
sanatorium
and
live
miserably
and
dejectedly
warding
off
death
she
said
but
life
is
full
of
goodliness
for
all
that
it
is
fuller
of
misery
he
said
nevertheless
she
had
shaken
him
she
still
kept
her
astonishing
power
of
influencing
his
opinions
all
his
passion
and
heat
and
rude
speech
analysed
out
was
only
his
terror
at
her
threatening
of
his
she
was
rather
piqued
by
his
rough
treatment
of
her
and
by
his
contemptuous
tone
moreover
she
could
never
quite
let
him
be
she
felt
a
driving
force
which
impelled
her
almost
against
her
will
to
interfere
in
his
life
she
invited
him
to
dine
with
them
at
highclose
he
was
now
quite
possible
he
had
in
the
course
of
his
business
been
sufficiently
in
the
company
of
gentlemen
to
be
altogether
comme
it
faut
at
a
private
dinner
and
after
dinner
she
wrote
me
concerning
him
occasionally
george
saxton
was
here
to
dinner
yesterday
he
and
leslie
had
frightful
battles
over
the
nationalisation
of
industries
george
is
rather
more
than
a
match
for
leslie
which
in
his
secret
heart
makes
our
friend
gloriously
proud
it
is
very
amusing
i
of
course
have
to
preserve
the
balance
of
power
and
of
course
to
bolster
my
husband
dignity
at
a
crucial
dangerous
moment
when
george
is
just
going
to
wave
his
bloody
sword
and
leslie
lies
bleeding
with
rage
i
step
in
and
prick
the
victor
under
the
heart
with
some
little
satire
or
some
esoteric
question
i
raise
leslie
and
say
his
blood
is
luminous
for
the
truth
and
vous
voilà
then
i
abate
for
the
thousandth
time
leslie
conservative
crow
and
i
appeal
once
more
to
is
no
use
my
arguing
with
him
he
gets
so
make
an
abtruse
appeal
for
all
the
wonderful
sad
and
beautiful
expressions
on
the
countenance
of
life
expressions
which
he
does
not
see
or
which
he
distorts
by
his
oblique
vision
of
socialism
into
there
i
am
i
think
i
am
something
of
a
machiavelli
but
it
is
quite
true
what
i
again
she
wrote
we
happened
to
be
motoring
from
derby
on
sunday
morning
and
as
we
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
we
had
to
thread
our
way
through
quite
a
large
crowd
i
looked
up
and
whom
should
i
see
but
our
friend
george
holding
forth
about
the
state
endowment
of
mothers
i
made
leslie
stop
while
we
listened
the
was
quite
full
of
people
george
saw
us
and
became
fiery
leslie
then
grew
excited
and
although
i
clung
to
the
skirts
of
his
coat
with
all
my
strength
he
jumped
up
and
began
to
question
i
must
say
it
with
shame
and
made
an
ass
of
himself
the
men
all
round
were
jeering
and
muttering
under
their
breath
i
think
leslie
is
not
very
popular
among
them
he
is
such
an
advocate
of
machinery
which
will
do
the
work
of
men
so
they
cheered
our
friend
george
when
he
thundered
forth
his
replies
and
his
demonstrations
he
pointed
his
finger
at
us
and
flung
his
hand
at
us
and
shouted
till
i
quailed
in
my
seat
i
can
not
understand
why
he
should
become
so
frenzied
as
soon
as
i
am
within
range
george
had
a
triumph
that
morning
but
when
i
saw
him
a
few
days
later
he
seemed
very
uneasy
rather
almost
a
year
later
i
heard
from
her
again
on
the
same
subject
i
have
had
such
a
lark
two
or
three
times
i
have
been
to
the
to
socialist
meetings
leslie
does
not
know
they
are
great
fun
of
course
i
am
in
sympathy
with
the
socialists
but
i
can
not
narrow
my
eyes
till
i
see
one
thing
only
life
is
like
a
large
rather
beautiful
man
who
is
young
and
full
of
vigour
but
hairy
barbaric
with
hands
hard
and
dirty
the
dirt
ingrained
i
know
his
hands
are
very
ugly
i
know
his
mouth
is
not
firmly
shapen
i
know
his
limbs
are
hairy
and
brutal
but
his
eyes
are
deep
and
very
beautiful
that
is
what
i
tell
george
the
people
are
so
earnest
they
make
me
sad
but
then
they
are
so
didactic
they
hold
forth
so
much
they
are
so
and
so
they
make
me
laugh
george
laughs
too
i
am
sure
we
made
such
fun
of
a
goggle
of
a
girl
who
had
suffered
in
prison
for
the
cause
of
women
that
i
am
ashamed
when
i
see
my
league
badge
at
the
bottom
you
know
cyril
i
do
care
for
anything
very
much
except
myself
things
seem
so
frivolous
i
am
the
only
real
thing
i
and
the
gradually
george
fell
out
of
the
socialist
movement
it
wearied
him
it
did
not
feed
him
altogether
he
began
by
mocking
his
friends
of
the
confraternity
then
he
spoke
in
bitter
dislike
of
hudson
the
wordy
humorous
shallow
leader
of
the
movement
in
eberwich
it
was
hudson
with
his
wriggling
and
his
who
disgusted
george
with
the
cause
finally
the
meetings
at
the
ceased
and
my
friend
dropped
all
connection
with
his
former
associates
he
began
to
speculate
in
land
a
hosiery
factory
moved
to
eberwich
giving
the
place
a
new
stimulus
to
growth
george
happened
to
buy
a
piece
of
land
at
the
end
of
the
street
of
the
village
when
he
got
it
it
was
laid
out
in
allotment
gardens
these
were
becoming
valueless
owing
to
the
encroachment
of
houses
he
took
it
divided
it
up
and
offered
it
as
sites
for
a
new
row
of
shops
he
sold
at
a
good
profit
altogether
he
was
becoming
very
well
off
i
heard
from
meg
that
he
was
flourishing
that
he
did
not
drink
anything
to
speak
of
but
that
he
was
always
out
she
hardly
saw
anything
of
him
if
was
to
keep
him
so
much
away
from
home
she
would
be
content
with
a
little
less
fortune
he
complained
that
she
was
narrow
and
that
she
would
not
entertain
any
sympathy
with
any
of
his
ideas
nobody
comes
here
to
see
me
twice
he
said
because
meg
receives
them
in
such
an
fashion
i
asked
jim
curtiss
and
his
wife
from
everley
hall
one
evening
we
were
uncomfortable
all
the
time
meg
had
hardly
a
word
for
and
and
hm
never
come
again
meg
herself
said
oh
i
ca
stand
folks
they
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
as
soon
as
they
begin
mincing
their
words
i
done
can
no
more
talk
than
a
thus
their
natures
contradicted
each
other
he
tried
hard
to
gain
a
footing
in
eberwich
as
it
was
he
belonged
to
no
class
of
society
whatsoever
meg
visited
and
entertained
the
wives
of
small
and
publicans
this
was
her
set
george
voted
the
women
vulgar
and
without
some
cause
meg
however
persisted
she
visited
when
she
thought
fit
and
entertained
when
he
was
out
he
made
acquaintance
after
acquaintance
francis
cartridge
the
veterinary
surgeon
toby
heswall
the
brewer
son
the
curtisses
farmers
of
good
standing
from
everley
hall
but
it
was
no
good
george
was
by
nature
a
family
man
he
wanted
to
be
private
and
secure
in
his
own
rooms
then
he
was
at
ease
as
meg
never
went
out
with
him
and
as
every
attempt
to
entertain
at
the
hollies
filled
him
with
shame
and
mortification
he
began
to
give
up
trying
to
place
himself
and
remained
suspended
in
social
isolation
at
the
hollies
the
friendship
between
lettie
and
himself
had
been
kept
up
in
spite
of
all
things
leslie
was
sometimes
jealous
but
he
dared
not
show
it
openly
for
fear
of
his
wife
scathing
contempt
george
went
to
highclose
perhaps
once
in
a
fortnight
perhaps
not
so
often
lettie
never
went
to
the
hollies
as
meg
attitude
was
too
antagonistic
meg
complained
very
bitterly
of
her
husband
he
often
made
a
beast
of
himself
drinking
he
thought
more
of
himself
than
he
ought
home
was
not
good
enough
for
him
he
was
selfish
to
the
he
cared
neither
for
her
nor
the
children
only
for
himself
i
happened
to
be
at
home
for
lettie
birthday
george
was
then
lettie
had
allowed
her
husband
to
forget
her
birthday
he
was
now
very
much
immersed
in
politics
foreseeing
a
general
election
in
the
following
year
and
intending
to
contest
the
seat
in
parliament
the
division
was
an
impregnable
liberal
stronghold
but
leslie
had
hopes
that
he
might
capture
the
situation
therefore
he
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
at
the
conservative
club
and
among
the
men
of
influence
in
the
southern
division
lettie
encouraged
him
in
these
affairs
it
relieved
her
of
him
it
was
thus
that
she
let
him
forget
her
birthday
while
for
some
unknown
reason
she
let
the
intelligence
slip
to
george
he
was
invited
to
dinner
as
i
was
at
home
george
came
at
seven
there
was
a
strange
feeling
of
festivity
in
the
house
although
there
were
no
evident
signs
lettie
had
dressed
with
some
magnificence
in
a
blackish
purple
gauze
over
soft
satin
of
lighter
tone
nearly
the
colour
of
double
violets
she
wore
vivid
green
azurite
ornaments
on
the
fairness
of
her
bosom
and
her
bright
hair
was
bound
by
a
band
of
the
same
colour
it
was
rather
startling
she
was
conscious
of
her
effect
and
was
very
excited
immediately
george
saw
her
his
eyes
wakened
with
a
dark
glow
she
stood
up
as
he
entered
her
hand
stretched
straight
out
to
him
her
body
very
erect
her
eyes
bright
and
rousing
like
two
blue
pennants
thank
you
so
much
she
said
softly
giving
his
hand
a
last
pressure
before
she
let
it
go
he
could
not
answer
so
he
sat
down
bowing
his
head
then
looking
up
at
her
in
suspense
she
smiled
at
her
presently
the
children
came
in
they
looked
very
quaint
like
acolytes
in
their
long
straight
of
quilted
blue
silk
the
boy
particularly
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
light
the
candles
in
some
childish
church
in
paradise
he
was
very
tall
and
slender
and
fair
with
a
round
fine
head
and
serene
features
both
children
looked
remarkably
almost
transparently
clean
it
is
impossible
to
consider
anything
more
fresh
and
fair
the
girl
was
a
merry
curly
headed
puss
of
six
she
played
with
her
mother
green
jewels
and
prattled
prettily
while
the
boy
stood
at
his
mother
side
a
slender
and
silent
acolyte
in
his
pale
blue
gown
i
was
impressed
by
his
patience
and
his
purity
when
the
girl
had
bounded
away
into
george
arms
the
lad
laid
his
hand
timidly
on
lettie
knee
and
looked
with
a
little
wonder
at
her
dress
how
pretty
those
green
stones
are
mother
he
said
yes
replied
lettie
brightly
lifting
them
and
letting
their
strange
pattern
fall
again
on
her
bosom
i
like
them
are
you
going
to
sing
mother
he
asked
perhaps
but
why
said
lettie
smiling
because
you
generally
sing
when
saxton
comes
he
bent
his
head
and
stroked
lettie
dress
shyly
do
i
she
said
laughing
can
you
hear
just
a
little
he
replied
quite
small
as
if
it
were
nearly
lost
in
the
dark
he
was
hesitating
shy
as
boys
are
lettie
laid
her
hand
on
his
head
and
stroked
his
smooth
fair
hair
sing
a
song
for
us
before
we
go
mother
he
asked
almost
shamefully
she
kissed
him
you
shall
sing
with
me
she
said
what
shall
it
be
she
played
without
a
copy
of
the
music
he
stood
at
her
side
while
lucy
the
little
mouse
sat
on
her
mother
skirts
pressing
silk
slippers
in
turn
upon
the
pedals
the
mother
and
the
boy
sang
their
song
gaily
the
troubadour
touched
his
guitar
as
he
was
hastening
from
the
war
the
boy
had
a
pure
treble
clear
as
the
flight
of
swallows
in
the
morning
the
light
shone
on
his
lips
under
the
piano
the
girl
child
sat
laughing
pressing
her
mother
feet
with
all
her
strength
and
laughing
again
lettie
smiled
as
she
sang
at
last
they
kissed
us
a
gentle
and
flitted
out
of
the
room
the
girl
popped
her
curly
head
round
the
door
again
we
saw
the
white
cuff
on
the
nurse
wrist
as
she
held
the
youngster
arm
you
come
and
kiss
us
when
we
in
bed
mum
asked
the
rogue
her
mother
laughed
and
agreed
lucy
was
withdrawn
for
a
moment
then
we
heard
her
just
a
tick
nurse
just
the
curly
head
appeared
round
the
door
again
and
teenie
sweetie
she
suggested
only
go
lettie
clapped
her
hands
in
mock
wrath
the
child
vanished
but
immediately
there
appeared
again
round
the
door
two
blue
laughing
eyes
and
the
snub
tip
of
a
nose
a
nice
one
a
lettie
rose
with
a
rustle
to
sweep
upon
her
the
child
vanished
with
a
glitter
of
laughter
we
heard
her
calling
breathlessly
on
the
wait
a
bit
freddie
for
me
george
and
lettie
smiled
at
each
other
when
the
children
had
gone
as
the
smile
died
from
their
faces
they
looked
down
sadly
and
until
dinner
was
announced
they
were
very
still
and
heavy
with
melancholy
after
dinner
lettie
debated
pleasantly
which
she
should
take
for
the
children
when
she
came
down
again
she
smoked
a
cigarette
with
us
over
coffee
george
did
not
like
to
see
her
smoking
yet
he
brightened
a
little
when
he
sat
down
after
giving
her
a
light
pleased
with
the
mark
of
recklessness
in
her
it
is
ten
years
since
my
party
at
woodside
she
said
reaching
for
the
small
roman
of
green
jade
that
she
used
as
an
my
years
he
exclaimed
bitterly
it
seems
a
hundred
it
does
and
it
does
she
answered
smiling
if
i
look
straight
back
and
think
of
my
excitement
it
seems
only
yesterday
if
i
look
between
then
and
now
at
all
the
days
that
lie
between
it
is
an
age
if
i
look
at
myself
he
said
i
think
i
am
another
person
altogether
you
have
changed
she
agreed
looking
at
him
sadly
there
is
a
great
you
are
not
another
person
i
often
is
one
of
his
old
looks
he
is
just
the
same
at
the
bottom
they
embarked
on
a
barge
of
gloomy
recollections
and
drifted
along
the
soiled
canal
of
their
past
the
worst
of
it
is
he
said
i
have
got
a
miserable
carelessness
a
contempt
for
things
you
know
i
had
such
a
faculty
for
reverence
i
always
believed
in
things
i
know
you
did
she
smiled
you
were
so
i
always
considered
you
always
thought
things
had
a
deep
religious
meaning
somewhere
hidden
and
you
reverenced
them
is
it
different
now
you
know
me
very
well
he
laughed
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
believe
in
if
not
in
myself
you
have
to
live
for
your
wife
and
children
she
said
with
firmness
meg
has
plenty
to
secure
her
and
the
children
as
long
as
they
live
he
said
smiling
so
i
do
know
that
i
essential
but
you
are
she
replied
you
are
necessary
as
a
father
and
a
husband
if
not
as
a
provider
i
think
said
he
marriage
is
more
of
a
duel
than
a
duet
one
party
wins
and
takes
the
other
captive
slave
you
like
it
is
so
more
or
less
well
said
lettie
well
he
answered
meg
is
not
like
you
she
wants
me
part
of
me
so
she
kill
me
rather
than
let
me
go
loose
oh
no
said
lettie
emphatically
you
know
nothing
about
it
he
said
quietly
in
the
marital
duel
meg
is
winning
the
woman
generally
does
she
has
the
children
on
her
side
i
ca
give
her
any
of
the
real
part
of
me
the
vital
part
that
she
ca
any
more
than
you
could
give
kisses
to
a
stranger
and
i
feel
that
i
do
care
no
she
said
you
are
getting
morbid
he
put
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
drew
a
deep
breath
then
slowly
sent
the
smoke
down
his
nostrils
no
he
said
look
here
she
said
let
me
sing
to
you
shall
i
and
make
you
cheerful
again
she
sang
from
wagner
it
was
the
music
of
resignation
and
despair
she
had
not
thought
of
it
all
the
time
he
listened
he
was
thinking
the
music
stimulated
his
thoughts
and
illuminated
the
trend
of
his
brooding
all
the
time
he
sat
looking
at
her
his
eyes
were
dark
with
his
thoughts
she
finished
the
star
of
eve
from
tannhäuser
and
came
over
to
him
why
are
you
so
sad
when
it
is
my
birthday
she
asked
plaintively
am
i
slow
he
replied
i
am
sorry
what
is
the
matter
she
said
sinking
onto
the
small
sofa
near
to
him
nothing
he
you
are
looking
very
beautiful
there
i
wanted
you
to
say
that
you
ought
to
be
quite
gay
you
know
when
i
am
so
smart
nay
he
said
i
know
i
ought
but
the
seems
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
me
i
ca
get
out
of
its
lean
arms
why
she
said
arms
are
not
lean
they
are
white
like
mine
she
lifted
her
arms
and
looked
at
them
smiling
how
do
you
know
he
asked
pertinently
oh
of
course
they
are
was
her
light
answer
he
laughed
brief
and
sceptical
no
he
said
it
came
when
the
children
kissed
us
what
she
asked
these
lean
arms
of
tomorrow
round
me
and
the
white
arms
round
you
he
replied
smiling
whimsically
she
reached
out
and
clasped
his
hand
you
foolish
boy
she
said
he
laughed
painfully
not
able
to
look
at
her
you
know
he
said
and
his
voice
was
low
and
difficult
i
have
needed
you
for
a
light
you
will
soon
be
the
only
light
again
who
is
the
other
she
asked
my
little
girl
he
answered
then
he
continued
and
you
know
i
could
endure
complete
darkness
i
could
it
the
solitariness
you
must
talk
like
this
she
said
you
know
you
must
she
put
her
hand
on
his
head
and
ran
her
fingers
through
the
hair
he
had
so
ruffled
it
is
as
thick
as
ever
your
hair
she
said
he
did
not
answer
but
kept
his
face
bent
out
of
sight
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
stood
at
the
back
of
his
low
taking
an
amber
comb
from
her
hair
she
bent
over
him
and
with
the
translucent
comb
and
her
white
fingers
she
busied
herself
with
his
hair
i
believe
you
have
a
parting
she
said
softly
he
laughed
shortly
at
her
playfulness
she
continued
combing
just
touching
pressing
the
strands
in
place
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
i
was
only
a
warmth
to
you
he
said
pursuing
the
same
train
of
thought
so
you
could
do
without
me
but
you
were
like
the
light
to
me
and
otherwise
it
was
dark
and
aimless
aimlessness
is
horrible
she
had
finally
smoothed
his
hair
so
she
lifted
her
hands
and
put
back
her
head
there
she
said
it
looks
fair
fine
as
alice
would
say
wings
are
raggy
in
comparison
he
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
her
are
you
going
to
look
at
yourself
she
said
playfully
reproachful
she
put
her
under
his
chin
he
lifted
his
head
and
they
looked
at
each
other
she
smiling
trying
to
make
him
play
he
smiling
with
his
lips
but
not
with
eyes
dark
with
pain
we
ca
go
on
like
this
lettie
can
we
he
said
softly
yes
she
answered
him
yes
why
not
it
ca
he
said
it
ca
i
could
keep
it
up
lettie
but
do
think
about
it
she
answered
do
think
of
it
lettie
he
said
i
have
to
set
my
teeth
with
loneliness
hush
she
said
no
there
are
the
children
do
say
not
be
serious
will
you
no
there
are
the
children
he
replied
smiling
dimly
yes
hush
now
stand
up
and
look
what
a
fine
parting
i
have
made
in
your
hair
stand
up
and
see
if
my
style
becomes
you
it
is
no
good
lettie
he
said
we
ca
go
on
oh
but
come
come
come
she
exclaimed
we
are
not
talking
about
going
on
we
are
considering
what
a
fine
parting
i
have
made
you
down
the
middle
like
two
wings
of
a
spread
she
looked
down
smiling
playfully
on
him
just
closing
her
eyes
slightly
in
petition
he
rose
and
took
a
deep
breath
and
set
his
shoulders
no
he
said
and
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
lettie
went
pale
and
also
stiffened
herself
no
he
repeated
it
is
impossible
i
felt
as
soon
as
fred
came
into
the
must
be
one
way
or
another
very
well
then
said
lettie
coldly
her
voice
was
muted
like
a
violin
yes
he
replied
submissive
the
children
he
looked
at
her
contracting
his
lips
in
a
smile
of
misery
are
you
sure
it
must
be
so
final
she
asked
rebellious
even
resentful
she
was
twisting
the
azurite
jewels
on
her
bosom
and
pressing
the
blunt
points
into
her
flesh
he
looked
up
from
the
fascination
of
her
action
when
he
heard
the
tone
of
her
last
question
he
was
angry
quite
sure
he
said
at
last
simply
ironically
she
bowed
her
head
in
assent
his
face
twitched
sharply
as
he
restrained
himself
from
speaking
again
then
he
turned
and
quietly
left
the
room
she
did
not
watch
him
go
but
stood
as
he
had
left
her
when
after
some
time
she
heard
the
grating
of
his
on
the
gravel
and
then
the
sharp
trot
of
hoofs
down
the
frozen
road
she
dropped
herself
on
the
settee
and
lay
with
her
bosom
against
the
cushions
looking
fixedly
at
the
wall
chapter
vi
the
scarp
slope
leslie
won
the
conservative
victory
in
the
general
election
which
took
place
a
year
or
so
after
my
last
visit
to
highclose
in
the
interim
the
tempests
had
entertained
a
continuous
stream
of
people
i
heard
occasionally
from
lettie
how
she
was
busy
amused
or
bored
she
told
me
that
george
had
thrown
himself
into
the
struggle
on
behalf
of
the
candidate
of
the
labour
party
that
she
had
not
seen
him
except
in
the
streets
for
a
very
long
time
when
i
went
down
to
eberwich
in
the
march
succeeding
the
election
i
found
several
people
staying
with
my
sister
she
had
under
her
wing
a
young
literary
fellow
who
affected
the
doady
doady
he
had
bunches
of
hair
and
a
romantic
black
cravat
he
played
the
impulsive
part
but
was
really
as
calculating
as
any
man
on
the
it
delighted
lettie
to
mother
him
he
was
so
shrewd
as
to
be
less
than
harmless
his
fellow
guests
a
woman
much
experienced
in
music
and
an
elderly
man
who
was
in
the
artistic
world
without
being
of
it
were
interesting
for
a
time
bubble
after
bubble
of
floating
fancy
and
wit
we
blew
with
our
breath
in
the
evenings
i
rose
in
the
morning
loathing
the
idea
of
more
i
wandered
around
nethermere
which
had
now
forgotten
me
the
daffodils
under
the
continued
their
golden
laughter
and
nodded
to
one
another
in
gossip
as
i
watched
them
never
for
a
moment
pausing
to
notice
me
the
yellow
reflection
of
daffodils
among
the
shadows
of
grey
willow
in
the
water
trembled
faintly
as
they
told
haunted
tales
in
the
gloom
i
felt
like
a
child
left
out
of
the
group
of
my
playmates
there
was
a
wind
running
across
nethermere
and
on
the
eager
water
blue
and
glistening
grey
shadows
changed
places
swiftly
along
the
shore
the
wild
birds
rose
flapping
in
expostulation
as
i
passed
peewits
mewing
fiercely
round
my
head
while
two
white
swans
lifted
their
glistening
feathers
till
they
looked
like
grand
double
laying
back
their
orange
beaks
among
the
petals
and
fronting
me
with
haughty
resentment
charging
towards
me
insolently
i
wanted
to
be
recognised
by
something
i
said
to
myself
that
the
dryads
were
looking
out
for
me
from
the
wood
edge
but
as
i
advanced
they
shrank
and
glancing
wistfully
turned
back
like
pale
flowers
falling
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
i
was
a
stranger
an
intruder
among
the
bushes
a
twitter
of
lively
birds
exclaimed
upon
me
finches
went
leaping
past
in
bright
flashes
and
a
robin
sat
and
asked
rudely
hello
who
are
you
the
bracken
lay
sere
under
the
trees
broken
and
chavelled
by
the
restless
wild
winds
of
the
long
winter
the
trees
caught
the
wind
in
their
tall
netted
twigs
and
the
young
morning
wind
moaned
at
its
captivity
as
i
trod
the
discarded
and
the
bracken
they
uttered
their
last
sharp
gasps
pressed
into
oblivion
the
wood
was
roofed
with
a
wide
young
sobbing
sound
and
floored
with
a
faint
hiss
like
the
intaking
of
the
last
breath
between
was
all
the
glad
of
buds
and
anemone
flowers
and
the
rush
of
birds
i
wandering
alone
felt
them
all
the
anguish
of
the
bracken
fallen
in
defeat
the
careless
dash
of
the
birds
the
sobbing
of
the
young
wind
arrested
in
its
haste
the
trembling
expanding
delight
of
the
buds
i
alone
among
them
could
hear
the
whole
succession
of
chords
the
brooks
talked
on
just
the
same
just
as
gladly
just
as
boisterously
as
they
had
done
when
i
had
netted
small
glittering
fish
in
the
at
strelley
mill
a
servant
girl
in
a
white
cap
and
white
came
running
out
of
the
house
with
purple
which
she
gave
to
the
elder
of
two
finicking
girls
who
sat
disconsolately
with
their
mother
in
the
governess
cart
at
the
gate
ready
to
go
to
church
near
woodside
there
was
along
the
path
and
at
the
end
of
every
riding
it
was
tarred
on
the
private
i
had
done
with
the
valley
of
nethermere
the
valley
of
nethermere
had
cast
me
out
many
years
before
while
i
had
fondly
believed
it
cherished
me
in
memory
i
went
along
the
road
to
eberwich
the
church
bells
were
ringing
boisterously
with
the
careless
boisterousness
of
the
brooks
and
the
birds
and
the
rollicking
coltsfoots
and
celandines
a
few
people
were
hastening
blithely
to
service
miners
and
other
labouring
men
were
passing
in
aimless
gangs
walking
nowhere
in
particular
so
long
as
they
reached
a
sufficiently
distant
public
house
i
reached
the
it
was
much
more
spruce
than
it
had
been
the
yard
however
and
the
stables
had
again
a
somewhat
abandoned
air
i
asked
the
maid
for
george
oh
master
not
up
yet
she
said
giving
a
little
significant
toss
of
her
head
and
smiling
i
waited
a
moment
but
he
rung
for
a
bottle
of
beer
about
ten
minutes
since
so
i
should
she
emphasised
the
word
with
some
ironical
contempt
wo
be
very
long
she
added
in
tones
which
conveyed
that
she
was
not
by
any
means
sure
i
asked
for
meg
oh
missis
is
gone
to
the
miss
saxton
is
in
she
emily
i
exclaimed
the
maid
smiled
she
in
the
she
engaged
but
perhaps
if
i
tell
yes
do
said
i
sure
that
emily
would
receive
me
i
found
my
old
sweetheart
sitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
a
man
standing
on
the
hearthrug
pulling
his
moustache
emily
and
i
both
felt
a
thrill
of
old
delight
at
meeting
i
can
hardly
believe
it
is
really
you
she
said
laughing
me
one
of
the
old
intimate
looks
she
had
changed
a
great
deal
she
was
very
handsome
but
she
had
now
a
new
a
fine
free
indifference
let
me
introduce
you
renshaw
cyril
tom
you
know
who
it
is
you
have
heard
me
speak
often
enough
of
cyril
i
am
going
to
marry
tom
in
three
weeks
time
she
said
laughing
the
devil
you
are
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
if
he
will
have
me
she
added
quite
as
a
playful
afterthought
tom
was
a
fair
man
smoothly
almost
delicately
tanned
there
was
something
soldierly
in
his
bearing
something
in
the
way
he
bent
his
head
and
pulled
his
moustache
something
charming
and
fresh
in
the
way
he
laughed
at
emily
last
preposterous
speech
why
did
you
tell
me
i
asked
why
did
you
ask
me
she
retorted
arching
her
brows
renshaw
i
said
you
have
me
all
unawares
quite
indecently
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
giving
one
more
twist
to
his
moustache
then
breaking
into
a
loud
short
laugh
at
his
joke
do
you
really
feel
cross
said
emily
to
me
knitting
her
brows
and
smiling
quaintly
i
do
i
replied
with
truthful
emphasis
she
laughed
and
laughed
again
very
much
amused
it
is
such
a
joke
she
said
to
think
you
should
feel
cross
now
when
it
long
is
it
i
will
not
count
up
said
i
are
you
not
sorry
for
me
i
asked
of
tom
renshaw
he
looked
at
me
with
his
young
blue
eyes
eyes
so
bright
so
naïvely
inquisitive
so
winsomely
meditative
he
did
not
know
quite
what
to
say
or
how
to
take
it
very
he
replied
in
another
short
burst
of
laughter
quickly
twisting
his
moustache
again
and
looking
down
at
his
feet
he
was
years
old
had
been
a
soldier
in
china
for
five
years
was
now
farming
his
father
farm
at
papplewick
where
emily
was
schoolmistress
he
had
been
at
home
eighteen
months
his
father
was
an
old
man
of
seventy
who
had
had
his
right
hand
chopped
to
bits
in
the
chopping
machine
so
they
told
me
i
liked
tom
for
his
handsome
bearing
and
his
fresh
winsome
way
he
was
exceedingly
manly
that
is
to
say
he
did
not
dream
of
questioning
or
analysing
anything
all
that
came
his
way
was
ready
labelled
nice
or
nasty
good
or
bad
he
did
not
imagine
that
anything
could
be
other
than
just
what
it
appeared
to
be
with
this
appearance
he
was
quite
content
he
looked
up
to
emily
as
one
wiser
nobler
nearer
to
god
than
himself
i
am
a
thousand
years
older
than
he
she
said
to
me
laughing
just
as
you
are
centuries
older
than
i
and
you
love
him
for
his
youth
i
asked
yes
she
replied
for
that
is
wonderfully
so
gentle
and
i
was
never
gentle
was
i
i
said
no
as
restless
and
as
urgent
as
the
wind
she
said
and
i
saw
a
last
flicker
of
the
old
terror
where
is
george
i
asked
in
bed
she
replies
briefly
he
recovering
from
one
of
his
orgies
if
i
were
meg
i
would
not
live
with
him
is
he
so
bad
i
asked
bad
she
replied
he
disgusting
and
i
sure
he
dangerous
have
him
removed
to
an
inebriate
home
you
have
to
persuade
him
to
go
said
tom
who
had
come
into
the
room
again
he
does
have
dreadful
bouts
though
he
killing
himself
sure
enough
i
feel
awfully
sorry
for
the
fellow
it
seems
so
contemptible
to
me
said
emily
to
become
enslaved
to
one
of
your
likings
till
it
makes
a
beast
of
you
look
what
a
spectacle
he
is
for
his
children
and
what
a
disgusting
disgrace
for
his
wife
well
if
he
ca
help
it
he
ca
poor
chap
said
tom
though
i
do
think
a
man
should
have
more
backbone
we
heard
heavy
noises
from
the
room
above
he
is
getting
up
said
emily
i
suppose
i
better
see
if
he
have
any
breakfast
she
waited
however
presently
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
george
with
his
hand
on
the
knob
leaning
looking
in
i
thought
i
heard
three
voices
he
said
as
if
it
freed
him
from
a
certain
apprehension
he
smiled
his
waistcoat
hung
open
over
his
woollen
shirt
he
wore
no
coat
and
was
slipperless
his
hair
and
his
moustache
were
dishevelled
his
face
pale
and
stupid
with
sleep
his
eyes
small
he
turned
aside
from
our
looks
as
from
a
bright
light
his
hand
as
i
shook
it
was
flaccid
and
chill
how
do
you
come
to
be
here
cyril
he
said
subduedly
faintly
smiling
will
you
have
any
breakfast
emily
asked
him
coldly
i
have
a
bit
if
there
any
for
me
he
replied
it
has
been
waiting
for
you
long
enough
she
answered
he
turned
and
went
with
a
dull
thud
of
his
stockinged
feet
across
to
the
emily
rang
for
the
maid
i
followed
george
leaving
the
betrothed
together
i
found
my
host
moving
about
the
looking
behind
the
chairs
and
in
the
corners
i
wonder
where
the
devil
my
slippers
are
he
muttered
explanatorily
meanwhile
he
continued
his
search
i
noticed
he
did
not
ring
the
bell
to
have
them
found
for
him
presently
he
came
to
the
fire
spreading
his
hands
over
it
as
he
was
smashing
the
slowly
burning
coal
the
maid
came
in
with
the
tray
he
desisted
and
put
the
poker
carefully
down
while
the
maid
spread
his
meal
on
one
corner
of
the
table
he
looked
in
the
fire
paying
her
no
heed
when
she
had
finished
it
fried
she
said
shall
you
have
that
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
plate
ay
he
said
have
you
brought
the
vinegar
without
answering
she
took
the
cruet
from
the
sideboard
and
set
it
on
the
table
as
she
was
closing
the
door
she
looked
back
to
say
you
better
eat
it
now
while
it
hot
he
took
no
notice
but
sat
looking
in
the
fire
and
how
are
you
going
on
he
asked
me
i
oh
very
well
and
as
you
see
he
replied
turning
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
little
gesture
of
irony
as
i
am
very
sorry
to
see
i
rejoined
he
sat
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
tapping
the
back
of
his
hand
with
one
finger
in
monotonous
like
are
you
going
to
have
breakfast
i
urged
the
clock
at
that
moment
began
to
ring
a
sonorous
twelve
he
looked
up
at
it
with
subdued
irritation
ay
i
suppose
so
he
answered
me
when
the
clock
had
finished
striking
he
rose
heavily
and
went
to
the
table
as
he
poured
out
a
cup
of
tea
he
spilled
it
on
the
cloth
and
stood
looking
at
the
stain
it
was
still
some
time
before
he
began
to
eat
he
poured
vinegar
freely
over
the
hot
fish
and
ate
with
an
indifference
that
made
eating
ugly
pausing
now
and
again
to
wipe
the
tea
off
his
moustache
or
to
pick
a
bit
of
fish
from
off
his
knee
you
are
not
married
i
suppose
he
said
in
one
of
his
pauses
no
i
replied
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
be
looking
round
you
wiser
not
he
replied
quiet
and
bitter
a
moment
or
two
later
the
maid
came
in
with
a
letter
this
came
this
morning
she
said
as
she
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
him
he
looked
at
it
then
he
said
you
did
give
me
a
knife
for
the
marmalade
did
i
she
replied
i
thought
you
would
want
it
you
do
as
a
rule
and
do
you
know
where
my
slippers
are
he
asked
they
ought
to
be
in
their
usual
place
she
went
and
looked
in
the
corner
i
suppose
miss
gertie
put
them
somewhere
i
get
you
another
pair
as
he
waited
for
her
he
read
the
letter
he
read
it
twice
then
he
put
it
back
in
the
envelope
quietly
without
any
change
of
expression
but
he
ate
no
more
breakfast
even
after
the
maid
had
brought
the
knife
and
his
slippers
and
though
he
had
had
but
a
few
mouthfuls
at
twelve
there
was
an
imperious
woman
voice
in
the
house
meg
came
to
the
door
as
she
entered
the
room
and
saw
me
she
stood
still
she
sniffed
glanced
at
the
table
and
exclaimed
coming
forward
effusively
well
i
never
cyril
who
a
thought
of
seeing
you
here
this
morning
how
are
you
she
waited
for
the
last
of
my
words
then
immediately
she
turned
to
george
and
said
i
must
say
you
in
a
nice
state
for
cyril
to
see
you
have
you
finished
you
have
kate
can
take
that
tray
out
it
smells
quite
sickly
have
you
finished
he
did
not
answer
but
drained
his
cup
of
tea
and
pushed
it
away
with
the
back
of
his
hand
meg
rang
the
bell
and
having
taken
off
her
gloves
began
to
put
the
things
on
the
tray
tipping
the
fragments
of
fish
and
bones
from
the
edge
of
his
plate
to
the
middle
with
short
disgusted
jerks
of
the
fork
her
attitude
and
expression
were
of
resentment
and
disgust
the
maid
came
in
clear
the
table
kate
and
open
the
window
have
you
opened
the
bedroom
windows
yet
glanced
at
george
as
if
to
say
he
had
only
been
down
a
few
minutes
then
do
it
when
you
have
taken
the
tray
said
meg
you
do
open
this
window
said
george
churlishly
it
cold
enough
as
it
is
you
should
put
a
coat
on
then
if
you
starved
replied
meg
contemptuously
it
warm
enough
for
those
that
have
got
any
life
in
their
blood
you
do
not
find
it
cold
do
you
cyril
it
is
fresh
this
morning
i
replied
of
course
it
is
not
cold
at
all
and
i
sure
this
room
needs
airing
the
maid
however
folded
the
cloth
and
went
out
without
approaching
the
windows
meg
had
grown
stouter
and
there
was
a
certain
immovable
confidence
in
her
she
was
authoritative
amiable
calm
she
wore
a
handsome
dress
of
dark
green
and
a
toque
with
opulent
ostrich
feathers
as
she
moved
about
the
room
she
seemed
to
dominate
everything
particularly
her
husband
who
sat
ruffled
and
dejected
his
waistcoat
hanging
loose
over
his
shirt
a
girl
entered
she
was
proud
and
mincing
in
her
deportment
her
face
was
handsome
but
too
haughty
for
a
child
she
wore
a
white
coat
with
ermine
tippet
muff
and
hat
her
long
brown
hair
hung
twining
down
her
back
has
dad
only
just
had
his
breakfast
she
exclaimed
in
high
censorious
tones
as
she
came
in
he
has
replied
meg
the
girl
looked
at
her
father
in
calm
childish
censure
and
we
have
been
to
church
and
come
home
to
dinner
she
said
as
she
drew
off
her
little
white
gloves
george
watched
her
with
ironical
amusement
hello
said
meg
glancing
at
the
opened
letter
which
lay
near
his
elbow
who
is
that
from
he
glanced
round
having
forgotten
it
he
took
the
envelope
doubled
it
and
pushed
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
it
from
william
housley
he
replied
oh
and
what
has
he
to
say
she
asked
george
turned
his
dark
eyes
at
her
nothing
he
said
sneered
meg
funny
letter
about
nothing
i
suppose
said
the
child
with
her
insolent
superiority
it
some
money
that
he
does
want
us
to
know
about
that
about
it
said
meg
giving
a
small
laugh
at
the
perspicuity
so
he
can
keep
it
for
himself
that
what
it
is
continued
the
child
nodding
her
head
in
rebuke
at
him
i
no
right
to
any
money
have
i
asked
the
father
sarcastically
no
you
have
the
child
nodded
her
head
at
him
dictatorially
you
have
because
you
only
put
it
in
the
fire
you
got
it
wrong
he
sneered
you
mean
it
like
giving
a
child
fire
to
play
with
um
it
is
is
it
mam
small
woman
turned
to
her
mother
for
corroboration
meg
had
flushed
at
his
sneer
when
he
quoted
for
the
child
its
mother
dictum
and
you
very
naughty
preached
gertie
turning
her
back
disdainfully
on
her
father
is
that
what
the
parson
been
telling
you
he
asked
a
grain
of
amusement
still
in
his
bitterness
no
it
is
retorted
the
youngster
if
you
want
to
know
you
should
go
and
listen
for
yourself
everybody
that
goes
to
church
looks
she
glanced
at
her
mother
and
at
herself
pruning
herself
proudly
god
loves
them
she
added
she
assumed
a
sanctified
expression
and
continued
after
a
little
thought
because
they
look
nice
and
are
meek
what
exclaimed
meg
laughing
glancing
with
secret
pride
at
me
because
they
meek
repeated
gertie
with
a
superior
little
smile
of
knowledge
you
off
the
mark
this
time
said
george
no
i
not
am
i
mam
is
it
right
mam
meek
shall
inevit
the
erf
meg
was
too
much
amused
to
answer
the
meek
shall
have
herrings
on
earth
mocked
the
father
also
amused
his
daughter
looked
dubiously
at
him
she
smelled
impropriety
it
not
mam
is
it
she
asked
turning
to
her
mother
meg
laughed
the
meek
shall
have
herrings
on
earth
repeated
george
with
soft
banter
no
it
not
mam
is
it
cried
the
child
in
real
distress
tell
your
father
he
always
teaching
you
something
wrong
answered
meg
then
i
said
i
must
go
they
pressed
me
to
stay
oh
stop
to
dinner
suddenly
pleaded
the
child
smoothing
her
wild
ravels
of
curls
after
having
drawn
off
her
hat
she
asked
me
again
and
again
with
much
earnestness
but
why
i
asked
so
you
can
talk
to
us
this
so
dad
wo
be
so
she
replied
plaintively
poking
the
black
spots
on
her
muff
meg
moved
nearer
to
her
daughter
with
a
little
gesture
of
compassion
but
said
i
i
promised
a
lady
i
would
be
back
for
lunch
so
i
must
you
have
some
more
visitors
you
know
oh
well
she
complained
they
go
in
another
room
and
dad
care
about
them
but
come
said
i
well
he
just
as
when
auntie
emily
is
with
her
an
all
you
having
your
character
given
away
said
meg
brutally
turning
to
him
i
bade
them
he
did
me
the
honour
of
coming
with
me
to
the
door
we
could
neither
of
us
find
a
word
to
say
though
we
were
both
moved
when
at
last
i
held
his
hand
and
was
looking
at
him
as
i
said
he
looked
back
at
me
for
the
first
time
during
our
meeting
his
eyes
were
heavy
and
as
he
lifted
them
to
me
seemed
to
recoil
in
an
agony
of
shame
chapter

a
prospect
among
the
marshes
of
lethe
george
steadily
declined
from
this
time
i
went
to
see
him
two
years
later
he
was
not
at
home
meg
wept
to
me
as
she
told
me
of
him
how
he
let
the
business
slip
how
he
drank
what
a
brute
he
was
in
drink
and
how
unbearable
afterwards
he
was
ruining
his
constitution
he
was
ruining
her
life
and
the
children
i
felt
very
sorry
for
her
as
she
sat
large
and
ruddy
brimming
over
with
bitter
tears
she
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
i
might
influence
him
he
was
she
said
at
the
ram
when
he
had
an
extra
bad
bout
on
he
went
up
there
and
stayed
sometimes
for
a
week
at
a
time
with
oswald
coming
back
to
the
hollies
when
he
had
though
said
meg
he
sick
every
morning
and
almost
after
every
meal
all
the
time
meg
was
telling
me
this
sat
curled
up
in
a
large
chair
their
youngest
boy
a
pale
sensitive
rather
spoiled
lad
of
seven
or
eight
years
with
a
petulant
mouth
and
nervous
dark
eyes
he
sat
watching
his
mother
as
she
told
her
tale
heaving
his
shoulders
and
settling
himself
in
a
new
position
when
his
feelings
were
nearly
too
much
for
him
he
was
full
of
wild
childish
pity
for
his
mother
and
furious
childish
hate
of
his
father
the
author
of
all
their
trouble
i
called
at
the
ram
and
saw
george
he
was
half
drunk
i
went
up
to
highclose
with
a
heavy
heart
lettie
last
child
had
been
born
much
to
the
surprise
of
everybody
some
few
months
before
i
came
down
there
was
a
space
of
seven
years
between
her
youngest
girl
and
this
baby
lettie
was
much
absorbed
in
motherhood
when
i
went
up
to
talk
to
her
about
george
i
found
her
in
the
bedroom
nursing
the
baby
who
was
very
good
and
quiet
on
her
knee
she
listened
to
me
sadly
but
her
attention
was
caught
away
by
each
movement
made
by
the
child
as
i
was
telling
her
of
the
attitude
of
george
children
towards
their
father
and
mother
she
glanced
from
the
baby
to
me
and
exclaimed
see
how
he
watches
the
light
flash
across
your
spectacles
when
you
turn
but
i
was
weary
of
babies
my
friends
had
all
grown
up
and
married
and
inflicted
them
on
me
there
were
storms
of
babies
i
longed
for
a
place
where
they
would
be
obsolete
and
young
arrogant
impervious
mothers
might
be
a
forgotten
tradition
lettie
heart
would
quicken
in
answer
to
only
one
pulse
the
easy
light
ticking
of
the
baby
blood
i
remembered
one
day
as
i
sat
in
the
train
hastening
to
charing
cross
on
my
way
from
france
that
that
was
george
birthday
i
had
the
feeling
of
him
upon
me
heavily
and
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
depression
i
put
it
down
to
travel
fatigue
and
tried
to
dismiss
it
as
i
watched
the
evening
sun
glitter
along
the
new
in
the
fields
we
passed
trying
to
describe
the
effect
to
myself
i
found
myself
asking
the
matter
i
not
had
bad
news
have
i
to
make
my
chest
feel
so
weighted
i
was
surprised
when
i
reached
my
lodging
in
new
maiden
to
find
no
letters
for
me
save
one
fat
budget
from
alice
i
knew
her
squat
saturnine
handwriting
on
the
envelope
and
i
thought
i
knew
what
contents
to
expect
from
the
letter
she
had
married
an
old
acquaintance
who
had
been
her
particular
aversion
this
young
man
had
got
himself
into
trouble
so
that
the
condemnations
of
the
righteous
pursued
him
like
clouds
of
gnats
on
a
summer
evening
alice
immediately
rose
to
sting
back
his
vulgar
enemies
and
having
rendered
him
a
service
felt
she
could
only
wipe
out
the
score
by
marrying
him
they
were
fairly
comfortable
occasionally
as
she
said
there
were
displays
of
small
fireworks
in
the
back
yard
he
worked
in
the
offices
of
some
iron
foundries
just
over
the
erewash
in
derbyshire
alice
lived
in
a
dirty
little
place
in
the
valley
a
mile
and
a
half
from
eberwich
not
far
from
his
work
she
had
no
children
and
practically
no
friends
a
few
young
matrons
for
acquaintances
as
wife
of
a
superior
clerk
she
had
to
preserve
her
dignity
among
the
so
all
her
little
crackling
fires
were
sodded
down
with
the
sods
of
british
respectability
occasionally
she
smouldered
a
fierce
smoke
that
made
one
eyes
water
occasionally
perhaps
once
a
year
she
wrote
me
a
whole
venomous
budget
much
to
my
amusement
i
was
not
in
any
haste
to
open
this
fat
letter
until
after
supper
i
turned
to
it
as
a
resource
from
my
depression
oh
dear
cyril
i
in
a
bubbling
state
i
want
to
yell
not
write
oh
cyril
why
did
marry
me
or
why
did
our
georgie
saxton
or
somebody
i
deadly
sick
percival
charles
is
enough
to
stop
a
clock
oh
cyril
he
lives
in
an
eternal
sunday
suit
holy
broadcloth
and
righteous
three
inches
of
cuffs
he
goes
to
bed
in
it
nay
he
wallows
in
bibles
when
he
goes
to
bed
i
can
feel
the
brass
covers
of
all
his
family
bibles
sticking
in
my
ribs
as
i
lie
by
his
side
i
could
weep
with
wrath
yet
i
put
on
my
black
hat
and
trot
to
chapel
with
him
like
a
lamb
oh
cyril
nothing
happened
nothing
has
happened
to
me
all
these
years
i
shall
die
of
it
when
i
see
percival
charles
at
dinner
after
having
asked
a
blessing
i
feel
as
if
i
should
never
touch
a
bit
at
his
table
again
in
about
an
hour
i
shall
hear
him
hurrying
up
the
always
make
him
his
first
look
will
be
on
the
table
but
i
not
fair
to
really
a
good
only
wish
he
was
it
george
saxton
who
put
this
seidlitz
powder
in
my
marital
cup
of
cocoa
cyril
i
must
a
tale
unfold
it
is
fifteen
years
since
our
george
married
meg
when
i
count
up
and
think
of
the
future
it
nearly
makes
me
scream
but
my
tale
my
tale
can
you
remember
his
eyes
cyril
you
can
see
the
whisky
or
the
brandy
combusting
in
them
he
got
i
seen
him
and
i
swarming
myself
with
little
red
devils
after
it
i
went
up
to
eberwich
on
wednesday
afternoon
for
a
pound
of
fry
for
percival
charles
thursday
dinner
i
walked
by
that
little
path
which
you
know
goes
round
the
back
of
the
as
near
as
any
way
for
me
i
thought
i
heard
a
row
in
the
paddock
at
the
back
of
the
stables
so
i
said
i
might
as
well
see
the
fun
i
went
to
the
gate
basket
in
one
hand
ninepence
in
coppers
in
the
other
a
demure
deacon
wife
i
did
take
in
the
scene
at
first
there
was
our
georgie
in
leggings
and
breeches
as
of
yore
and
a
whip
he
was
flourishing
and
striding
and
yelling
it
old
boy
i
said
want
your
stocking
round
your
throat
but
cyril
i
had
spoken
too
soon
oh
lum
there
came
raking
up
the
croft
that
long
racehorse
of
his
ears
flat
and
clinging
to
its
neck
the
lad
wilfred
the
kid
was
white
as
death
and
squealing
mam
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
rotten
of
georgie
trying
to
teach
the
kid
to
jockey
the
boy
i
call
bouncing
round
like
a
spiral
then
i
saw
our
georgie
rush
up
screaming
nearly
spitting
the
moustache
off
his
face
and
fetch
the
horse
a
cut
with
the
whip
it
went
off
like
a
flame
along
hot
paraffin
the
kid
shrieked
and
clung
georgie
went
rushing
after
him
running
staggery
and
swearing
fairly
screaming
little
swine
the
high
lanky
went
larroping
round
as
if
it
was
going
mad
i
was
dazed
then
meg
came
rushing
and
the
other
two
lads
all
screaming
she
went
for
george
but
he
lifted
his
whip
like
the
devil
she
dare
go
near
rushed
at
him
and
stopped
rushed
at
him
and
stopped
striking
at
him
with
her
two
fists
he
waved
his
whip
and
kept
her
off
and
the
kept
tearing
along
meg
flew
to
stop
it
he
ran
with
his
drunken
brandishing
his
whip
i
flew
as
well
i
hit
him
with
my
basket
the
kid
fell
off
and
meg
rushed
to
him
some
men
came
running
george
stood
fairly
shuddering
you
would
never
have
known
his
face
cyril
he
was
mad
demoniacal
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
should
burst
and
shatter
to
bits
like
a
when
i
think
of
it
i
got
such
a
weal
on
my
arm
i
lost
percival
charles
ninepence
and
my
nice
white
cloth
out
of
the
basket
and
everything
besides
having
black
looks
on
thursday
because
it
was
mutton
chops
which
he
hates
oh
cyril
wish
i
was
a
cassowary
on
the
banks
of
the
timbuctoo
when
i
saw
meg
sobbing
over
that
goodness
he
was
i
wished
our
georgie
was
dead
i
do
now
also
i
wish
we
only
had
to
remember
him
i
have
been
to
see
them
stand
meg
ikeyness
i
wonder
how
it
all
will
end
there
bidding
night
and
god
bless
you
to
brother
jakes
and
no
supper
as
soon
as
i
could
after
reading
alice
letter
i
went
down
to
eberwich
to
see
how
things
were
memories
of
the
old
days
came
over
me
again
till
my
heart
hungered
for
its
old
people
they
told
me
at
the
hollies
that
after
a
bad
attack
of
delirium
tremens
george
had
been
sent
to
papplewick
in
the
lonely
country
to
stay
with
emily
i
borrowed
a
bicycle
to
ride
the
nine
miles
the
summer
had
been
wet
and
everything
was
late
at
the
end
of
september
the
foliage
was
heavy
green
and
the
wheat
stood
dejectedly
in
stook
i
rode
through
the
still
sweetness
of
an
autumn
morning
the
mist
was
folded
blue
along
the
hedges
the
elm
trees
loomed
up
along
the
dim
walls
of
the
morning
the
trees
at
hand
flickered
with
a
few
yellow
leaves
like
bright
blossoms
as
i
rode
through
the
tree
tunnel
by
the
church
where
on
his
last
night
the
keeper
had
told
me
his
story
i
smelled
the
cold
rotting
of
the
leaves
of
the
cloudy
summer
i
passed
silently
through
the
lanes
where
the
chill
grass
was
weighed
down
with
of
dew
in
the
shadow
where
the
wet
woollen
of
autumn
were
spread
as
on
a
loom
brown
birds
rustled
in
flocks
like
driven
leaves
before
me
i
heard
the
hooting
of
the
at
the
pits
telling
me
it
was
eleven
that
the
men
and
boys
would
be
sitting
in
the
narrow
darkness
of
the
mines
eating
their
snap
while
shadowy
mice
darted
for
the
crumbs
and
the
boys
laughed
with
red
mouths
rimmed
with
grime
as
the
bold
little
creatures
peeped
at
them
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamps
the
dogwood
berries
stood
jauntily
scarlet
on
the
the
bunched
scarlet
and
green
berries
of
the
convolvulus
and
bryony
hung
amid
golden
trails
the
blackberries
dropped
ungathered
i
rode
slowly
on
the
plants
dying
around
me
the
berries
leaning
their
heavy
ruddy
mouths
and
languishing
for
the
birds
the
men
imprisoned
underground
below
me
the
brown
birds
dashing
in
haste
along
the
hedges
swineshed
farm
where
the
renshaws
lived
stood
quite
alone
among
its
fields
hidden
from
the
highway
and
from
everything
the
lane
leading
up
to
it
was
deep
and
unsunned
on
my
right
i
caught
glimpses
through
the
hedge
of
the
where
the
shocks
of
wheat
stood
like
small
ships
in
a
widespread
flotilla
the
upper
part
of
the
field
was
cleared
i
heard
the
clank
of
a
wagon
and
the
voices
of
men
and
i
saw
the
high
load
of
sheaves
go
lurching
rocking
up
the
incline
to
the
stackyard
the
lane
debouched
into
a
field
and
out
of
this
empty
land
the
farm
rose
up
with
its
buildings
like
a
huddle
of
old
painted
vessels
floating
in
still
water
white
fowls
went
stepping
discreetly
through
the
mild
sunshine
and
the
shadow
i
leaned
my
bicycle
against
the
grey
silken
doors
of
the
old
the
place
was
breathing
with
silence
i
hesitated
to
knock
at
the
open
door
emily
came
she
was
rich
as
always
with
her
large
beauty
and
stately
now
with
the
stateliness
of
a
strong
woman
six
months
gone
with
child
she
exclaimed
with
surprise
and
i
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
glistening
pans
and
the
white
wood
baths
as
i
passed
through
the
scullery
the
kitchen
was
a
low
room
that
through
long
course
of
years
had
become
absolutely
a
home
the
great
beams
of
the
ceiling
bowed
easily
the
had
a
bit
of
curtain
and
under
the
high
was
another
low
shelf
that
the
men
could
reach
with
their
hands
as
they
sat
in
the
there
the
pipes
lay
many
generations
of
peaceful
men
and
fruitful
women
had
passed
through
the
room
and
not
one
but
had
added
a
new
small
comfort
a
chair
in
the
right
place
a
hook
a
stool
a
cushion
a
certain
pleasing
cloth
for
the
sofa
covers
a
shelf
of
books
the
room
that
looked
so
quiet
and
crude
was
a
home
evolved
through
generations
to
fit
the
large
bodies
of
the
men
who
dwelled
in
it
and
the
placid
fancy
of
the
women
at
last
it
had
an
individuality
it
was
the
home
of
the
renshaws
warm
lovable
serene
emily
was
in
perfect
accord
with
its
brownness
its
shadows
its
ease
i
as
i
sat
on
the
sofa
under
the
window
felt
rejected
by
the
kind
room
i
was
distressed
with
a
sense
of
ephemerality
of
pale
erratic
fragility
emily
in
her
beauty
was
at
home
it
is
rare
now
to
feel
a
kinship
between
a
room
and
the
one
who
inhabits
it
a
close
bond
of
blood
relation
emily
had
at
last
found
her
place
and
had
escaped
from
the
torture
of
strange
complex
modern
life
she
was
making
a
pie
and
the
flour
was
white
on
her
brown
arms
she
pushed
the
tickling
hair
from
her
face
with
her
arm
and
looked
at
me
with
tranquil
pleasure
as
she
worked
the
paste
in
the
yellow
bowl
i
was
quiet
subdued
before
her
you
are
very
happy
i
said
ah
very
she
replied
and
you
are
not
you
look
worn
yes
i
replied
i
am
happy
enough
i
am
living
my
life
do
you
find
it
wearisome
she
asked
pityingly
she
made
me
tell
her
all
my
doings
and
she
marvelled
but
all
the
time
her
eyes
were
dubious
and
pitiful
you
have
george
here
i
said
yes
he
in
a
poor
state
but
he
not
as
sick
as
he
was
what
about
the
delirium
tremens
oh
he
was
better
of
he
came
here
he
sometimes
fancies
they
coming
on
again
and
he
terrified
is
it
awful
and
he
brought
it
all
on
himself
tom
very
good
to
him
there
nothing
the
matter
with
is
there
i
asked
i
do
know
she
replied
as
she
went
to
the
oven
to
turn
a
pie
that
was
baking
she
put
her
arm
to
her
forehead
and
brushed
aside
her
hair
leaving
a
mark
of
flour
on
her
nose
for
a
moment
or
two
she
remained
kneeling
on
the
fender
looking
into
the
fire
and
thinking
he
was
in
a
poor
way
when
he
came
here
could
eat
nothing
sick
every
morning
i
suppose
it
his
liver
they
all
end
like
that
she
continued
to
wipe
the
large
black
plums
and
put
them
in
the
dish
hardening
of
the
liver
i
asked
she
nodded
and
is
he
in
bed
i
asked
again
yes
she
replied
it
as
i
say
if
he
get
up
and
potter
about
a
bit
he
get
over
it
but
he
lies
there
skulking
and
what
time
will
he
get
up
i
insisted
i
do
know
he
may
crawl
down
somewhere
towards
do
you
want
to
see
him
that
what
you
came
for
is
it
she
smiled
at
me
with
a
little
sarcasm
and
added
you
always
thought
more
of
him
than
anybody
did
you
ah
well
come
up
and
see
him
i
followed
her
up
the
back
stairs
which
led
out
of
the
kitchen
and
which
emerged
straight
in
a
bedroom
we
crossed
the
of
this
naked
room
and
opened
a
door
at
the
opposite
side
george
lay
in
bed
watching
us
with
apprehensive
eyes
here
is
cyril
come
to
see
you
said
emily
so
i
brought
him
up
for
i
did
know
when
you
be
downstairs
a
small
smile
of
relief
came
on
his
face
and
he
put
out
his
hand
from
the
bed
he
lay
with
the
disorderly
clothes
pulled
up
to
his
chin
his
face
was
discoloured
and
rather
bloated
his
nose
swollen
do
you
feel
so
well
this
morning
asked
emily
softening
with
pity
when
she
came
into
contact
with
his
sickness
oh
all
right
he
replied
wishing
only
to
get
rid
of
us
you
should
try
to
get
up
a
bit
it
a
beautiful
morning
warm
and
she
said
gently
he
did
not
reply
and
she
went
downstairs
i
looked
round
to
the
cold
whitewashed
room
with
its
ceiling
curving
and
sloping
down
the
walls
it
was
sparsely
furnished
and
bare
of
even
the
slightest
ornament
the
only
things
of
warm
colour
were
the
cow
and
horse
skins
on
the
floor
all
the
rest
was
white
or
grey
or
drab
on
one
side
the
roof
sloped
down
so
that
the
window
was
below
my
knees
and
nearly
touching
the
floor
on
the
other
side
was
a
larger
window
breast
high
through
it
one
could
see
the
jumbled
ruddy
roofs
of
the
sheds
and
the
skies
the
tiles
were
shining
with
patches
of
vivid
orange
lichen
beyond
was
the
and
the
men
small
in
the
distance
lifting
the
sheaves
on
the
cart
you
will
come
back
to
farming
again
wo
you
i
asked
him
turning
to
the
bed
he
smiled
i
do
know
he
answered
dully
would
you
rather
i
went
downstairs
i
asked
no
i
glad
to
see
you
he
replied
in
the
same
uneasy
fashion
i
only
just
come
back
from
france
i
said
ah
he
replied
indifferent
i
am
sorry
you
ill
i
said
he
stared
unmovedly
at
the
opposite
wall
i
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
after
some
time
i
compelled
myself
to
say
in
a
casual
manner
wo
you
get
up
and
come
out
a
bit
i
suppose
is
have
to
he
said
gathering
himself
slowly
together
for
the
effort
he
pushed
himself
up
in
bed
when
he
took
off
the
jacket
of
his
pajamas
to
wash
himself
i
turned
away
his
arms
seemed
thin
and
he
had
bellied
and
was
bowed
and
unsightly
i
remembered
the
morning
we
swam
in
the
i
remembered
that
he
was
now
in
the
prime
of
his
life
i
looked
at
his
bluish
feeble
hands
as
he
laboriously
washed
himself
the
soap
once
slipped
from
his
fingers
as
he
was
picking
it
up
and
fell
rattling
the
pot
loudly
it
startled
us
and
he
seemed
to
grip
the
sides
of
the
washstand
to
steady
himself
then
he
went
on
with
his
slow
painful
toilet
as
he
combed
his
hair
he
looked
at
himself
with
dull
eyes
of
shame
the
men
were
coming
in
from
the
scullery
when
we
got
downstairs
dinner
was
smoking
on
the
table
i
shook
hands
with
tom
renshaw
and
with
the
old
man
hard
fierce
left
hand
then
i
was
introduced
to
arthur
renshaw
a
large
bashful
lad
of
twenty
i
nodded
to
the
man
jim
and
to
jim
wife
annie
we
all
sat
down
to
table
well
an
are
ter
feelin
by
now
like
asked
the
old
man
heartily
of
george
receiving
no
answer
he
continued
tha

a
bit
of
this
mutton
wo

tom
asked
him
tapping
the
joint
with
the
carving
knife
george
shook
his
head
it
quite
lean
and
tender
he
said
gently
no
thanks
said
george
a
bit
a
bit
cried
the
old
man
it
do
what

bit
o
strengthenin
nourishment

no
good
if

stomach

it
said
tom
in
mild
reproof
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
a
child
arthur
filled
george
glass
with
beer
without
speaking
the
two
young
men
were
full
of
kind
gentle
attention
let
a
spoonful
o
tonnup
then
persisted
the
old
man
i
canna

while
plate
stands
there
so
they
put
turnip
and
onion
sauce
on
george
plate
and
he
took
up
his
fork
and
tasted
a
few
mouthfuls
the
men
ate
largely
and
with
zest
the
sight
of
their
grand
satisfaction
amounting
almost
to
gusto
sickened
him
when
at
last
the
old
man
laid
down
the
dessert
spoon
which
he
used
in
place
of
a
knife
and
fork
he
looked
again
at
george
plate
and
said
why
tha
aten
a
smite
not
a
smite

george
maintained
a
stupid
silence

him

emily

feyther
added
tom
smiling
he
spoke
to
his
father
in
dialect
but
to
emily
in
good
english
whatever
she
said
had
tom
immediate
support
before
serving
us
with
pie
emily
gave
her
brother
junket
and
damsons
setting
the
plate
and
the
spoon
before
him
as
if
he
were
a
child
for
this
act
of
grace
tom
looked
at
her
lovingly
and
stroked
her
hand
as
she
passed
after
dinner
george
said
with
a
miserable
struggle
for
an
indifferent
tone
are
you
going
to
give
cyril
a
glass
of
whisky
he
looked
up
furtively
in
a
conflict
of
shame
and
hope
a
silence
fell
on
the
room
ay
said
the
old
man
softly
let
a
drop
yes
added
tom
in
submissive
pleading
all
the
men
in
the
room
shrank
a
little
awaiting
the
verdict
of
the
woman
i
do
know
she
said
clearly
that
cyril
wants
a
glass
i
do
mind
i
answered
feeling
myself
blush
i
had
not
the
courage
to
counteract
her
will
directly
not
even
the
old
man
had
that
courage
we
waited
in
suspense
after
keeping
us
so
for
a
few
minutes
while
we
smouldered
with
mortification
she
went
into
another
room
and
we
heard
her
unlocking
a
door
she
returned
with
a
decanter
containing
rather
less
than
half
a
pint
of
liquor
she
put
out
five
tumblers
tha
nedna
me
none
said
the
old
man
ah
non
a
proud
chap
not
nor
me
neither
said
arthur
you
will
tom
she
asked
do
you
want
me
to
he
replied
smiling
i
do
she
answered
sharply
i
want
nobody
to
have
it
when
you
look
at
the
results
of
it
but
if
cyril
is
having
a
glass
you
may
as
well
have
one
with
him
tom
was
pleased
with
her
she
gave
her
husband
and
me
fairly
stiff
glasses
steady
steady
he
said
give
that
george
and
give
me
not
so
much
two
fingers
two
of
your
fingers
you
know
but
she
passed
him
the
glass
when
george
had
had
his
share
there
remained
but
a
drop
in
the
decanter
emily
watched
the
drunkard
coldly
as
he
took
this
remainder
george
and
i
talked
for
a
time
while
the
men
smoked
he
from
his
glum
stupidity
broke
into
a
harsh
almost
imbecile
loquacity
have
you
seen
my
family
lately
he
asked
continuing
yes
not
badly
set
up
are
they
the
children
but
the
little
devils
are
soft
every
one
of
it
their
mother
bringin
marded
till
they
were
soft
an
would
never
let
me
have
a
say
in
it
i
should
brought
up
different
you
know
i
should
tom
looked
at
emily
and
remarking
her
angry
contempt
suggested
that
she
should
go
out
with
him
to
look
at
the
stacks
i
watched
the
tall
man
leaning
with
deference
and
tenderness
towards
his
wife
as
she
walked
calmly
at
his
side
she
was
the
mistress
quiet
and
he
her
rejoiced
husband
and
servant
george
was
talking
about
himself
if
i
had
not
seen
him
i
should
hardly
have
recognised
the
words
as
his
he
was
lamentably
decayed
he
talked
stupidly
with
vulgar
contumely
of
others
and
in
weak
praise
of
himself
the
old
man
rose
with
a
well
i
suppose
we
mun
another
dag
at
it
and
the
men
left
the
house
george
continued
his
foolish
harsh
monologue
making
gestures
of
emphasis
with
his
head
and
his
hands
he
continued
when
we
were
walking
round
the
buildings
into
the
fields
the
same
babble
of
bragging
and
abuse
i
was
wearied
and
disgusted
he
looked
and
he
sounded
so
worthless
across
the
empty
cornfield
the
partridges
were
running
we
walked
through
the
september
haze
slowly
because
he
was
feeble
on
his
legs
as
he
became
tired
he
ceased
to
talk
we
leaned
for
some
time
on
a
gate
in
the
brief
glow
of
the
transient
afternoon
and
he
was
stupid
again
he
did
not
notice
the
brown
haste
of
the
partridges
he
did
not
care
to
share
with
me
the
handful
of
ripe
blackberries
and
when
i
pulled
the
bryony
ropes
off
the
hedges
and
held
the
great
knots
of
red
and
green
berries
in
my
hand
he
glanced
at
them
without
interest
or
appreciation
are
they
he
said
dully
like
a
tree
that
is
falling
going
soft
and
pale
and
rotten
clammy
with
small
fungi
he
stood
leaning
against
the
gate
while
the
dim
afternoon
drifted
with
a
flow
of
thick
sweet
sunshine
past
him
not
touching
him
in
the
stackyard
the
summer
splendid
monuments
of
wheat
and
grass
were
reared
in
gold
and
grey
the
wheat
was
littered
brightly
round
the
rising
stack
the
loaded
wagon
clanked
slowly
up
the
incline
drew
near
and
rode
like
a
ship
at
anchor
against
the
scotches
brushing
the
stack
with
a
crisp
sharp
sound
tom
climbed
the
ladder
and
stood
a
moment
there
against
the
sky
amid
the
brightness
and
fragrance
of
the
gold
corn
and
waved
his
arm
to
his
wife
who
was
passing
in
the
shadow
of
the
building
then
arthur
began
to
lift
the
sheaves
to
the
stack
and
the
two
men
worked
in
an
exquisite
subtle
rhythm
their
white
sleeves
and
their
dark
heads
gleaming
moving
against
the
mild
sky
and
the
corn
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
occasional
lurch
of
the
body
of
the
wagon
as
the
teamer
stepped
to
the
front
or
again
to
the
rear
of
the
load
occasionally
i
could
catch
the
blue
glitter
of
the
prongs
of
the
forks
tom
now
lifted
high
above
the
small
wagon
load
called
to
his
brother
some
question
about
the
stack
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
strong
and
mellow
i
turned
to
george
who
also
was
watching
and
said
you
ought
to
be
like
that
we
heard
tom
calling
all
right
and
saw
him
standing
high
up
on
the
tallest
corner
of
the
stack
as
on
the
prow
of
a
ship
george
watched
and
his
face
slowly
gathered
expression
he
turned
to
me
his
dark
eyes
alive
with
horror
and
despair
i
shall
out
of
everybody
way
he
said
his
moment
of
fear
and
despair
was
cruel
i
cursed
myself
for
having
roused
him
from
his
stupor
you
will
be
better
i
said
he
watched
again
the
handsome
movement
of
the
men
at
the
stack
i
could
team
ten
sheaves
he
said
you
will
in
a
month
or
two
i
urged
he
continued
to
watch
while
tom
got
on
the
ladder
and
came
down
the
front
of
the
stack
nay
the
sooner
i
clear
out
the
better
he
repeated
to
himself
when
we
went
in
to
tea
he
was
as
tom
said
downcast
the
men
talked
uneasily
with
abated
voices
emily
attended
to
him
with
a
little
palpitating
solicitude
we
were
all
uncomfortably
impressed
with
the
sense
of
our
alienation
from
him
he
sat
apart
and
obscure
among
us
like
a
condemned
man
