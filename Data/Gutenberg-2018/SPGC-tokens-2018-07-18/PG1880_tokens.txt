the
pathfinder
or
the
inland
sea
by
james
fenimore
cooper
preface
the
plan
of
this
tale
suggested
itself
to
the
writer
many
years
since
though
the
details
are
altogether
of
recent
invention
the
idea
of
associating
seamen
and
savages
in
incidents
that
might
be
supposed
characteristic
of
the
great
lakes
having
been
mentioned
to
a
publisher
the
latter
obtained
something
like
a
pledge
from
the
author
to
carry
out
the
design
at
some
future
day
which
pledge
is
now
tardily
and
imperfectly
redeemed
the
reader
may
recognize
an
old
friend
under
new
circumstances
in
the
principal
character
of
this
legend
if
the
exhibition
made
of
this
old
acquaintance
in
the
novel
circumstances
in
which
he
now
appears
should
be
found
not
to
lessen
his
favor
with
the
public
it
will
be
a
source
of
extreme
gratification
to
the
writer
since
he
has
an
interest
in
the
individual
in
question
that
falls
little
short
of
reality
it
is
not
an
easy
task
however
to
introduce
the
same
character
in
four
separate
works
and
to
maintain
the
peculiarities
that
are
indispensable
to
identity
without
incurring
a
risk
of
fatiguing
the
reader
with
sameness
and
the
present
experiment
has
been
so
long
delayed
quite
as
much
from
doubts
of
its
success
as
from
any
other
cause
in
this
as
in
every
other
undertaking
it
must
be
the
end
that
will
crown
the
the
indian
character
has
so
little
variety
that
it
has
been
my
object
to
avoid
dwelling
on
it
too
much
on
the
present
occasion
its
association
with
the
sailor
too
it
is
feared
will
be
found
to
have
more
novelty
than
interest
it
may
strike
the
novice
as
an
anachronism
to
place
vessels
on
the
ontario
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
but
in
this
particular
facts
will
fully
bear
out
all
the
license
of
the
fiction
although
the
precise
vessels
mentioned
in
these
pages
may
never
have
existed
on
that
water
or
anywhere
else
others
so
nearly
resembling
them
are
known
to
have
navigated
that
inland
sea
even
at
a
period
much
earlier
than
the
one
just
mentioned
as
to
form
a
sufficient
authority
for
their
introduction
into
a
work
of
fiction
it
is
a
fact
not
generally
remembered
however
well
known
it
may
be
that
there
are
isolated
spots
along
the
line
of
the
great
lakes
that
date
as
settlements
as
far
back
as
many
of
the
older
american
towns
and
which
were
the
seats
of
a
species
of
civilization
long
before
the
greater
portion
of
even
the
older
states
was
rescued
from
the
wilderness
ontario
in
our
own
times
has
been
the
scene
of
important
naval
evolutions
fleets
have
manoeuvered
on
those
waters
which
half
a
century
ago
were
as
deserted
as
waters
well
can
be
and
the
day
is
not
distant
when
the
whole
of
that
vast
range
of
lakes
will
become
the
seat
of
empire
and
fraught
with
all
the
interests
of
human
society
a
passing
glimpse
even
though
it
be
in
a
work
of
fiction
of
what
that
vast
region
so
lately
was
may
help
to
make
up
the
sum
of
knowledge
by
which
alone
a
just
appreciation
can
be
formed
of
the
wonderful
means
by
which
providence
is
clearing
the
way
for
the
advancement
of
civilization
across
the
whole
american
continent

the
sublimity
connected
with
vastness
is
familiar
to
every
eye
the
most
abstruse
the
most
perhaps
the
most
chastened
of
the
poet
thoughts
crowd
on
the
imagination
as
he
gazes
into
the
depths
of
the
illimitable
void
the
expanse
of
the
ocean
is
seldom
seen
by
the
novice
with
indifference
and
the
mind
even
in
the
obscurity
of
night
finds
a
parallel
to
that
grandeur
which
seems
inseparable
from
images
that
the
senses
can
not
compass
with
feelings
akin
to
this
admiration
and
awe
the
offspring
of
sublimity
were
the
different
characters
with
which
the
action
of
this
tale
must
open
gazing
on
the
scene
before
them
four
persons
in
all
two
of
each
sex
they
had
managed
to
ascend
a
pile
of
trees
that
had
been
uptorn
by
a
tempest
to
catch
a
view
of
the
objects
that
surrounded
them
it
is
still
the
practice
of
the
country
to
call
these
spots
by
letting
in
the
light
of
heaven
upon
the
dark
and
damp
recesses
of
the
wood
they
form
a
sort
of
oases
in
the
solemn
obscurity
of
the
virgin
forests
of
america
the
particular
of
which
we
are
writing
lay
on
the
brow
of
a
gentle
acclivity
and
though
small
it
had
opened
the
way
for
an
extensive
view
to
those
who
might
occupy
its
upper
margin
a
rare
occurrence
to
the
traveller
in
the
woods
philosophy
has
not
yet
determined
the
nature
of
the
power
that
so
often
lays
desolate
spots
of
this
description
some
ascribing
it
to
the
whirlwinds
which
produce
waterspouts
on
the
ocean
while
others
again
impute
it
to
sudden
and
violent
passages
of
streams
of
the
electric
fluid
but
the
effects
in
the
woods
are
familiar
to
all
on
the
upper
margin
of
the
opening
the
viewless
influence
had
piled
tree
on
tree
in
such
a
manner
as
had
not
only
enabled
the
two
males
of
the
party
to
ascend
to
an
elevation
of
some
thirty
feet
above
the
level
of
the
earth
but
with
a
little
care
and
encouragement
to
induce
their
more
timid
companions
to
accompany
them
the
vast
trunks
which
had
been
broken
and
driven
by
the
force
of
the
gust
lay
blended
like
while
their
branches
still
exhaling
the
fragrance
of
withering
leaves
were
interlaced
in
a
manner
to
afford
sufficient
support
to
the
hands
one
tree
had
been
completely
uprooted
and
its
lower
end
filled
with
earth
had
been
cast
uppermost
in
a
way
to
supply
a
sort
of
staging
for
the
four
adventurers
when
they
had
gained
the
desired
distance
from
the
ground
the
reader
is
to
anticipate
none
of
the
appliances
of
people
of
condition
in
the
description
of
the
personal
appearances
of
the
group
in
question
they
were
all
wayfarers
in
the
wilderness
and
had
they
not
been
neither
their
previous
habits
nor
their
actual
social
positions
would
have
accustomed
them
to
many
of
the
luxuries
of
rank
two
of
the
party
indeed
a
male
and
female
belonged
to
the
native
owners
of
the
soil
being
indians
of
the
tribe
of
the
tuscaroras
while
their
companions
were
a
man
who
bore
about
him
the
peculiarities
of
one
who
had
passed
his
days
on
the
ocean
and
was
too
in
a
station
little
if
any
above
that
of
a
common
mariner
and
his
female
associate
who
was
a
maiden
of
a
class
in
no
great
degree
superior
to
his
own
though
her
youth
sweetness
and
countenance
and
a
modest
but
spirited
mien
lent
that
character
of
intellect
and
refinement
which
adds
so
much
to
the
charm
of
beauty
in
the
sex
on
the
present
occasion
her
full
blue
eye
reflected
the
feeling
of
sublimity
that
the
scene
excited
and
her
pleasant
face
was
beaming
with
the
pensive
expression
with
which
all
deep
emotions
even
though
they
bring
the
most
grateful
pleasure
shadow
the
countenances
of
the
ingenuous
and
thoughtful
and
truly
the
scene
was
of
a
nature
deeply
to
impress
the
imagination
of
the
beholder
towards
the
west
in
which
direction
the
faces
of
the
party
were
turned
the
eye
ranged
over
an
ocean
of
leaves
glorious
and
rich
in
the
varied
and
lively
verdure
of
a
generous
vegetation
and
shaded
by
the
luxuriant
tints
which
belong
to
the
degree
of
latitude
the
elm
with
its
graceful
and
weeping
top
the
rich
varieties
of
the
maple
most
of
the
noble
oaks
of
the
american
forest
with
the
linden
known
in
the
parlance
of
the
country
as
the
basswood
mingled
their
uppermost
branches
forming
one
broad
and
seemingly
interminable
carpet
of
foliage
which
stretched
away
towards
the
setting
sun
until
it
bounded
the
horizon
by
blending
with
the
clouds
as
the
waves
and
the
sky
meet
at
the
base
of
the
vault
of
heaven
here
and
there
by
some
accident
of
the
tempests
or
by
a
caprice
of
nature
a
trifling
opening
among
these
giant
members
of
the
forest
permitted
an
inferior
tree
to
struggle
upward
toward
the
light
and
to
lift
its
modest
head
nearly
to
a
level
with
the
surrounding
surface
of
verdure
of
this
class
were
the
birch
a
tree
of
some
account
in
regions
less
favored
the
quivering
aspen
various
generous
and
divers
others
which
resembled
the
ignoble
and
vulgar
thrown
by
circumstances
into
the
presence
of
the
stately
and
great
here
and
there
too
the
tall
straight
trunk
of
the
pine
pierced
the
vast
field
rising
high
above
it
like
some
grand
monument
reared
by
art
on
a
plain
of
leaves
it
was
the
vastness
of
the
view
the
nearly
unbroken
surface
of
verdure
that
contained
the
principle
of
grandeur
the
beauty
was
to
be
traced
in
the
delicate
tints
relieved
by
graduations
of
light
and
shade
while
the
solemn
repose
induced
the
feeling
allied
to
awe

the
wondering
but
pleased
girl
addressing
her
male
companion
whose
arm
she
rather
touched
than
leaned
on
to
steady
her
own
light
but
firm
footing
this
is
like
a
view
of
the
ocean

so
much
love
so
much
for

a

a
term
of
affection
the
sailor
often
used
in
allusion
to
his
niece
personal
attractions
no
one
but
a
child
would
think
of
likening
this
handful
of
leaves
to
a
look
at
the
real
atlantic
you
might
seize
all
these
to
neptune
jacket
and
they
would
make
no
more
than
a
nosegay
for
his
more
fanciful
than
true
i
think
uncle
look
thither
it
must
be
miles
on
miles
and
yet
we
see
nothing
but
leaves
what
could
one
behold
if
looking
at
the
ocean
more
returned
the
uncle
giving
an
impatient
gesture
with
the
elbow
the
other
touched
for
his
arms
were
crossed
and
the
hands
were
thrust
into
the
bosom
of
a
vest
of
red
cloth
a
fashion
of
the
times
more

say
rather
what
less
where
are
your
combing
seas
your
blue
water
your
rollers
your
breakers
your
whales
or
your
waterspouts
and
your
endless
motion
in
this
bit
of
a
forest
child
and
where
are
your
your
solemn
silence
your
fragrant
leaves
and
your
beautiful
green
uncle
on
the
ocean
tut

if
you
understood
the
thing
you
would
know
that
green
water
is
a
sailor
bane
he
scarcely
relishes
a
greenhorn
but
green
trees
are
a
different
thing
hist
that
sound
is
the
air
breathing
among
the
leaves
you
should
hear
a

if
you
fancy
wind
aloft
now
where
are
your
gales
and
hurricanes
and
trades
and
levanters
and
such
like
incidents
in
this
bit
of
a
forest
and
what
fishes
have
you
swimming
beneath
yonder
tame
surface
that
there
have
been
tempests
here
these
signs
around
us
plainly
show
and
beasts
if
not
fishes
are
beneath
those
i
do
not
know
that
returned
the
uncle
with
a
sailor
dogmatism
they
told
us
many
stories
at
albany
of
the
wild
animals
we
should
fall
in
with
and
yet
we
have
seen
nothing
to
frighten
a
seal
i
doubt
if
any
of
your
inland
animals
will
compare
with
a
low
latitude

exclaimed
the
niece
who
was
more
occupied
with
the
sublimity
and
beauty
of
the
boundless
wood
than
with
her
uncle
arguments
yonder
is
a
smoke
curling
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
can
it
come
from
a
house
ay
ay
there
is
a
look
of
humanity
in
that
smoke
returned
the
old
seaman
which
is
worth
a
thousand
trees
i
must
show
it
to
arrowhead
who
may
be
running
past
a
port
without
knowing
it
it
is
probable
there
is
a
caboose
where
there
is
a
as
he
concluded
the
uncle
drew
a
hand
from
his
bosom
touched
the
male
indian
who
was
standing
near
him
lightly
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
out
a
thin
line
of
vapor
which
was
stealing
slowly
out
of
the
wilderness
of
leaves
at
a
distance
of
about
a
mile
and
was
diffusing
itself
in
almost
imperceptible
threads
of
humidity
in
the
quivering
atmosphere
the
tuscarora
was
one
of
those
warriors
oftener
met
with
among
the
aborigines
of
this
continent
a
century
since
than
and
while
he
had
mingled
sufficiently
with
the
colonists
to
be
familiar
with
their
habits
and
even
with
their
language
he
had
lost
little
if
any
of
the
wild
grandeur
and
simple
dignity
of
a
chief
between
him
and
the
old
seaman
the
intercourse
had
been
friendly
but
distant
for
the
indian
had
been
too
much
accustomed
to
mingle
with
the
officers
of
the
different
military
posts
he
had
frequented
not
to
understand
that
his
present
companion
was
only
a
subordinate
so
imposing
indeed
had
been
the
quiet
superiority
of
the
tuscarora
reserve
that
charles
cap
for
so
was
the
seaman
named
in
his
most
dogmatical
or
facetious
moments
had
not
ventured
on
familiarity
in
an
intercourse
which
had
now
lasted
more
than
a
week
the
sight
of
the
curling
smoke
however
had
struck
the
latter
like
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
sail
at
sea
and
for
the
first
time
since
they
met
he
ventured
to
touch
the
warrior
as
has
been
related
the
quick
eye
of
the
tuscarora
instantly
caught
a
sight
of
the
smoke
and
for
full
a
minute
he
stood
slightly
raised
on
tiptoe
with
distended
nostrils
like
the
buck
that
scents
a
taint
in
the
air
and
a
gaze
as
riveted
as
that
of
the
trained
pointer
while
he
waits
his
master
aim
then
falling
back
on
his
feet
a
low
exclamation
in
the
soft
tones
that
form
so
singular
a
contrast
to
its
harsher
cries
in
the
indian
warrior
voice
was
barely
audible
otherwise
he
was
undisturbed
his
countenance
was
calm
and
his
quick
dark
eagle
eye
moved
over
the
leafy
panorama
as
if
to
take
in
at
a
glance
every
circumstance
that
might
enlighten
his
mind
that
the
long
journey
they
had
attempted
to
make
through
a
broad
belt
of
wilderness
was
necessarily
attended
with
danger
both
uncle
and
niece
well
knew
though
neither
could
at
once
determine
whether
the
sign
that
others
were
in
their
vicinity
was
the
harbinger
of
good
or
evil
there
must
be
oneidas
or
tuscaroras
near
us
arrowhead
said
cap
addressing
his
indian
companion
by
his
conventional
english
name
will
it
not
be
well
to
join
company
with
them
and
get
a
comfortable
berth
for
the
night
in
their
wigwam
no
wigwam
there
arrowhead
answered
in
his
unmoved
manner
too
much
but
indians
must
be
there
perhaps
some
old
of
your
own
master
no
tuscarora
no
oneida
no
mohawk
the
devil
it
is
well
magnet
this
surpasses
a
seaman
philosophy
we
old
can
tell
a
lubber
nest
from
a
mate
hammock
but
i
do
not
think
the
oldest
admiral
in
his
majesty
fleet
can
tell
a
smoke
from
a
the
idea
that
human
beings
were
in
their
vicinity
in
that
ocean
of
wilderness
had
deepened
the
flush
on
the
blooming
cheek
and
brightened
the
eye
of
the
fair
creature
at
his
side
but
she
soon
turned
with
a
look
of
surprise
to
her
relative
and
said
hesitatingly
for
both
had
often
admired
the
tuscarora
knowledge
or
we
might
almost
say
instinct
a
fire
surely
uncle
he
can
not
know
ten
days
since
child
i
would
have
sworn
to
it
but
now
i
hardly
know
what
to
believe
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
asking
arrowhead
why
you
fancy
that
smoke
now
a
smoke
and
not
a
wet
wood
returned
the
warrior
with
the
calmness
with
which
the
pedagogue
might
point
out
an
arithmetical
demonstration
to
his
puzzled
pupil
much
wet
much
smoke
much
water
black
but
begging
your
pardon
master
arrowhead
the
smoke
is
not
black
nor
is
there
much
of
it
to
my
eye
now
it
is
as
light
and
fanciful
a
smoke
as
ever
rose
from
a
captain
when
nothing
was
left
to
make
the
fire
but
a
few
chips
from
the
too
much
water
returned
arrowhead
with
a
slight
nod
of
the
head
tuscarora
too
cunning
to
make
fire
with
water
too
much
book
and
burn
anything
much
book
little
well
that
reasonable
i
allow
said
cap
who
was
no
devotee
of
learning
he
means
that
as
a
hit
at
your
reading
magnet
for
the
chief
has
sensible
notions
of
things
in
his
own
way
how
far
now
arrowhead
do
you
make
us
by
your
calculation
from
the
bit
of
a
pond
that
you
call
the
great
lake
and
towards
which
we
have
been
so
many
days
shaping
our
course
the
tuscarora
looked
at
the
seaman
with
quiet
superiority
as
he
answered
ontario
like
heaven
one
sun
and
the
great
traveller
will
know
well
i
have
been
a
great
traveller
i
can
not
deny
but
of
all
my
this
has
been
the
longest
the
least
profitable
and
the
farthest
inland
if
this
body
of
fresh
water
is
so
nigh
arrowhead
and
so
large
one
might
think
a
pair
of
good
eyes
would
find
it
out
for
apparently
everything
within
thirty
miles
is
to
be
seen
from
this
look
said
arrowhead
stretching
an
arm
before
him
with
quiet
grace
ontario
uncle
you
are
accustomed
to
cry
ho
but
not
ho
and
you
do
not
see
it
cried
the
niece
laughing
as
girls
will
laugh
at
their
own
idle
conceits
how
now
magnet
dost
suppose
that
i
should
know
my
native
element
if
it
were
in
sight
but
ontario
is
not
your
native
element
dear
uncle
for
you
come
from
the
salt
water
while
this
is
that
might
make
some
difference
to
your
young
mariner
but
none
to
the
old
one
i
should
know
water
child
were
i
to
see
it
in
ontario
repeated
arrowhead
with
emphasis
again
stretching
his
hand
towards
the
cap
looked
at
the
tuscarora
for
the
first
time
since
their
acquaintance
with
something
like
an
air
of
contempt
though
he
did
not
fail
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
chief
eye
and
arm
both
of
which
were
directed
towards
a
vacant
point
in
the
heavens
a
short
distance
above
the
plain
of
leaves
ay
ay
this
is
much
as
i
expected
when
i
left
the
coast
in
search
of
a
pond
resumed
cap
shrugging
his
shoulders
like
one
whose
mind
was
made
up
and
who
thought
no
more
need
be
said
ontario
may
be
there
or
for
that
matter
it
may
be
in
my
pocket
well
i
suppose
there
will
be
room
enough
when
we
reach
it
to
work
our
canoe
but
arrowhead
if
there
be
in
our
neighborhood
i
confess
i
should
like
to
get
within
hail
of
the
tuscarora
now
gave
a
quiet
inclination
of
his
head
and
the
whole
party
descended
from
the
roots
of
the
tree
in
silence
when
they
reached
the
ground
arrowhead
intimated
his
intention
to
go
towards
the
fire
and
ascertain
who
had
lighted
it
while
he
advised
his
wife
and
the
two
others
to
return
to
a
canoe
which
they
had
left
in
the
adjacent
stream
and
await
his
return
why
chief
this
might
do
on
soundings
and
in
an
offing
where
one
knew
the
channel
returned
old
cap
but
in
an
unknown
region
like
this
i
think
it
unsafe
to
trust
the
pilot
alone
too
far
from
the
ship
so
with
your
leave
we
will
not
part
what
my
brother
want
asked
the
indian
gravely
though
without
taking
offence
at
a
distrust
that
was
sufficiently
plain
your
company
master
arrowhead
and
no
more
i
will
go
with
you
and
speak
these
the
tuscarora
assented
without
difficulty
and
again
he
directed
his
patient
and
submissive
little
wife
who
seldom
turned
her
full
rich
black
eye
on
him
but
to
express
equally
her
respect
her
dread
and
her
love
to
proceed
to
the
boat
but
here
magnet
raised
a
difficulty
although
spirited
and
of
unusual
energy
under
circumstances
of
trial
she
was
but
woman
and
the
idea
of
being
entirely
deserted
by
her
two
male
protectors
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
that
her
senses
had
just
told
her
was
seemingly
illimitable
became
so
keenly
painful
that
she
expressed
a
wish
to
accompany
her
uncle
the
exercise
will
be
a
relief
dear
sir
after
sitting
so
long
in
the
canoe
she
added
as
the
rich
blood
slowly
returned
to
a
cheek
that
had
paled
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
calm
and
there
may
be
females
with
the
come
then
child
it
is
but
a
cable
length
and
we
shall
return
an
hour
before
the
sun
with
this
permission
the
girl
whose
real
name
was
mabel
dunham
prepared
to
be
of
the
party
while
the
as
the
wife
of
arrowhead
was
called
passively
went
her
way
towards
the
canoe
too
much
accustomed
to
obedience
solitude
and
the
gloom
of
the
forest
to
feel
apprehension
the
three
who
remained
in
the
now
picked
their
way
around
its
tangled
maze
and
gained
the
margin
of
the
woods
a
few
glances
of
the
eye
sufficed
for
arrowhead
but
old
cap
deliberately
set
the
smoke
by
a
before
he
trusted
himself
within
the
shadows
of
the
trees
this
steering
by
the
nose
magnet
may
do
well
enough
for
an
indian
but
your
thoroughbred
knows
the
virtue
of
the
needle
said
the
uncle
as
he
trudged
at
the
heels
of
the
tuscarora
america
would
never
have
been
discovered
take
my
word
for
it
if
columbus
had
been
nothing
but
nostrils
friend
arrowhead
didst
ever
see
a
machine
like
this
the
indian
turned
cast
a
glance
at
the
compass
which
cap
held
in
a
way
to
direct
his
course
and
gravely
answered
a
eye
the
tuscarora
see
in
his
head
the
for
so
the
indian
styled
his
companion
all
eye
now
no
he
means
uncle
that
we
had
needs
be
silent
perhaps
he
distrusts
the
persons
we
are
about
to
ay
is
an
indian
fashion
of
going
to
quarters
you
perceive
he
has
examined
the
priming
of
his
rifle
and
it
may
be
as
well
if
i
look
to
that
of
my
own
without
betraying
alarm
at
these
preparations
to
which
she
had
become
accustomed
by
her
long
journey
in
the
wilderness
mabel
followed
with
a
step
as
elastic
as
that
of
the
indian
keeping
close
in
the
rear
of
her
companions
for
the
first
half
mile
no
other
caution
beyond
a
rigid
silence
was
observed
but
as
the
party
drew
nearer
to
the
spot
where
the
fire
was
known
to
be
much
greater
care
became
necessary
the
forest
as
usual
had
little
to
intercept
the
view
below
the
branches
but
the
tall
straight
trunks
of
trees
everything
belonging
to
vegetation
had
struggled
towards
the
light
and
beneath
the
leafy
canopy
one
walked
as
it
might
be
through
a
vast
natural
vault
upheld
by
myriads
of
rustic
columns
these
columns
or
trees
however
often
served
to
conceal
the
adventurer
the
hunter
or
the
foe
and
as
arrowhead
swiftly
approached
the
spot
where
his
practised
and
unerring
senses
told
him
the
strangers
ought
to
be
his
footstep
gradually
became
lighter
his
eye
more
vigilant
and
his
person
was
more
carefully
concealed
see
saltwater
said
he
exulting
pointing
through
the
vista
of
trees
fire
by
the
lord
the
fellow
is
right
muttered
cap
there
they
are
sure
enough
and
eating
their
grub
as
quietly
as
if
they
were
in
the
cabin
of
a
arrowhead
is
but
half
right
whispered
mabel
for
there
are
two
indians
and
only
one
white
said
the
tuscarora
holding
up
two
fingers
red
man
holding
up
one
well
rejoined
cap
it
is
hard
to
say
which
is
right
and
which
is
wrong
one
is
entirely
white
and
a
fine
comely
lad
he
is
with
an
air
of
respectability
about
him
one
is
a
as
plain
as
paint
and
nature
can
make
him
but
the
third
chap
is
being
neither
brig
nor
repeated
arrowhead
again
raising
two
fingers
red
man
showing
but
one
he
must
be
right
uncle
for
his
eye
seems
never
to
fail
but
it
is
now
urgent
to
know
whether
we
meet
as
friends
or
foes
they
may
be
one
hail
will
soon
satisfy
us
on
that
head
returned
cap
stand
you
behind
the
tree
magnet
lest
the
knaves
take
it
into
their
heads
to
fire
a
broadside
without
a
parley
and
i
will
soon
learn
what
colors
they
sail
the
uncle
had
placed
his
two
hands
to
his
mouth
to
form
a
trumpet
and
was
about
to
give
the
promised
hail
when
a
rapid
movement
from
the
hand
of
arrowhead
defeated
the
intention
by
deranging
the
instrument
red
man
mohican
said
the
tuscarora
good
these
are
heavenly
tidings
murmured
mabel
who
little
relished
the
prospect
of
a
deadly
fray
in
that
remote
wilderness
let
us
approach
at
once
dear
uncle
and
proclaim
ourselves
good
said
the
tuscarora
red
man
cool
and
know
hurried
and
fire
let
the
squaw
what
said
cap
in
astonishment
send
little
magnet
ahead
as
a
lookout
while
two
lubbers
like
you
and
me
to
see
what
sort
of
a
landfall
she
will
make
if
i
do
i
it
is
wisest
uncle
interrupted
the
generous
girl
and
i
have
no
fear
no
christian
seeing
a
woman
approach
alone
would
fire
upon
her
and
my
presence
will
be
a
pledge
of
peace
let
me
go
forward
as
arrowhead
wishes
and
all
will
be
well
we
are
as
yet
unseen
and
the
surprise
of
the
strangers
will
not
partake
of
good
returned
arrowhead
who
did
not
conceal
his
approbation
of
mabel
spirit
it
has
an
look
answered
cap
but
being
in
the
woods
no
one
will
know
it
if
you
think
mabel
uncle
i
know
there
is
no
cause
to
fear
for
me
and
you
are
always
nigh
to
protect
well
take
one
of
the
pistols
then
nay
i
had
better
rely
on
my
youth
and
feebleness
said
the
girl
smiling
while
her
color
heightened
under
her
feelings
among
christian
men
a
woman
best
guard
is
her
claim
to
their
protection
i
know
nothing
of
arms
and
wish
to
live
in
ignorance
of
the
uncle
desisted
and
after
receiving
a
few
cautious
instructions
from
the
tuscarora
mabel
rallied
all
her
spirit
and
advanced
alone
towards
the
group
seated
near
the
fire
although
the
heart
of
the
girl
beat
quick
her
step
was
firm
and
her
movements
seemingly
were
without
reluctance
a
silence
reigned
in
the
forest
for
they
towards
whom
she
approached
were
too
much
occupied
in
appeasing
their
hunger
to
avert
their
looks
for
an
instant
from
the
important
business
in
which
they
were
all
engaged
when
mabel
however
had
got
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
fire
she
trod
upon
a
dried
stick
and
the
trifling
noise
produced
by
her
light
footstep
caused
the
mohican
as
arrowhead
had
pronounced
the
indian
to
be
and
his
companion
whose
character
had
been
thought
so
equivocal
to
rise
to
their
feet
as
quick
as
thought
both
glanced
at
the
rifles
that
leaned
against
a
tree
and
then
each
stood
without
stretching
out
an
arm
as
his
eyes
fell
on
the
form
of
the
girl
the
indian
uttered
a
few
words
to
his
companion
and
resumed
his
seat
and
his
meal
as
calmly
as
if
no
interruption
had
occurred
on
the
contrary
the
white
man
left
the
fire
and
came
forward
to
meet
mabel
the
latter
saw
as
the
stranger
approached
that
she
was
about
to
be
addressed
by
one
of
her
own
color
though
his
dress
was
so
strange
a
mixture
of
the
habits
of
the
two
races
that
it
required
a
near
look
to
be
certain
of
the
fact
he
was
of
middle
age
but
there
was
an
open
honesty
a
total
absence
of
guile
in
his
face
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
thought
handsome
that
at
once
assured
magnet
she
was
in
no
danger
still
she
paused
fear
nothing
young
woman
said
the
hunter
for
such
his
attire
would
indicate
him
to
be
you
have
met
christian
men
in
the
wilderness
and
such
as
know
how
to
treat
all
kindly
who
are
disposed
to
peace
and
justice
i
am
a
man
well
known
in
all
these
parts
and
perhaps
one
of
my
names
may
have
reached
your
ears
by
the
frenchers
and
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
lakes
i
am
called
la
longue
carabine
by
the
mohicans
a
and
upright
tribe
what
is
left
of
them
hawk
eye
while
the
troops
and
rangers
along
this
side
of
the
water
call
me
pathfinder
inasmuch
as
i
have
never
been
known
to
miss
one
end
of
the
trail
when
there
was
a
mingo
or
a
friend
who
stood
in
need
of
me
at
the
this
was
not
uttered
boastfully
but
with
the
honest
confidence
of
one
who
well
knew
that
by
whatever
name
others
might
have
heard
of
him
who
had
no
reason
to
blush
at
the
reports
the
effect
on
mabel
was
instantaneous
the
moment
she
heard
the
last
she
clasped
her
hands
eagerly
and
repeated
the
word
pathfinder
so
they
call
me
young
woman
and
many
a
great
lord
has
got
a
title
that
he
did
not
half
so
well
merit
though
if
truth
be
said
i
rather
pride
myself
in
finding
my
way
where
there
is
no
path
than
in
finding
it
where
there
is
but
the
regular
troops
are
by
no
means
particular
and
half
the
time
they
do
know
the
difference
between
a
trail
and
a
path
though
one
is
a
matter
for
the
eye
while
the
other
is
little
more
than
then
you
are
the
friend
my
father
promised
to
send
to
meet
us
if
you
are
sergeant
dunham
daughter
the
great
prophet
of
the
delawares
never
uttered
more
i
am
mabel
and
yonder
hid
by
the
trees
are
my
uncle
whose
name
is
cap
and
a
tuscarora
called
arrowhead
we
did
not
hope
to
meet
you
until
we
had
nearly
reached
the
shores
of
the
i
wish
a
indian
had
been
your
guide
said
pathfinder
for
i
am
no
lover
of
the
tuscaroras
who
have
travelled
too
far
from
the
graves
of
their
fathers
always
to
remember
the
great
spirit
and
arrowhead
is
an
ambitious
chief
is
the
with
him
his
wife
accompanies
us
and
a
humble
and
mild
creature
she
ay
and
which
is
more
than
any
who
know
him
will
say
of
arrowhead
well
we
must
take
the
fare
that
providence
bestows
while
we
follow
the
trail
of
life
i
suppose
worse
guides
might
have
been
found
than
the
tuscarora
though
he
has
too
much
mingo
blood
for
one
who
consorts
altogether
with
the
it
is
then
perhaps
fortunate
we
have
met
said
mabel
it
is
not
misfortunate
at
any
rate
for
i
promised
the
sergeant
i
would
see
his
child
safe
to
the
garrison
though
i
died
for
it
we
expected
to
meet
you
before
you
reached
the
falls
where
we
have
left
our
own
canoe
while
we
thought
it
might
do
no
harm
to
come
up
a
few
miles
in
order
to
be
of
service
if
wanted
it
is
lucky
we
did
for
i
doubt
if
arrowhead
be
the
man
to
shoot
the
here
come
my
uncle
and
the
tuscarora
and
our
parties
can
now
as
mabel
concluded
cap
and
arrowhead
who
saw
that
the
conference
was
amicable
drew
nigh
and
a
few
words
sufficed
to
let
them
know
as
much
as
the
girl
herself
had
learned
from
the
strangers
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
party
proceeded
towards
the
two

still
remained
near
the
fire

the

continued
to

the

rose
and
courteously
took
off
his

to

he
was

and
manly
in
appearance

he
wore

it
was

seamen
were
a
class
entirely
apart
from
the
rest
of
mankind
their
ideas
ordinary
language
and
attire
being
as
strongly
indicative
of
their
calling
as
the
opinions
speech
and
dress
of
a
turk
denote
a
mussulman
although
the
pathfinder
was
scarcely
in
the
prime
of
life
mabel
had
met
him
with
a
steadiness
that
may
have
been
the
consequence
of
having
braced
her
nerves
for
the
interview
but
when
her
eyes
encountered
those
of
the
young
man
at
the
fire
they
fell
before
the
gaze
of
admiration
with
which
she
saw
or
fancied
she
saw
he
greeted
her
each
in
truth
felt
that
interest
in
the
other
which
similarity
of
age
condition
mutual
comeliness
and
their
novel
situation
would
be
likely
to
inspire
in
the
young
and
ingenuous
here
said
pathfinder
with
an
honest
smile
bestowed
on
mabel
are
the
friends
your
worthy
father
has
sent
to
meet
you
this
is
a
great
delaware
and
one
who
has
had
honors
as
well
as
troubles
in
his
day
he
has
an
indian
name
fit
for
a
chief
but
as
the
language
is
not
always
easy
for
the
inexperienced
to
pronounce
we
naturally
turn
it
into
english
and
call
him
the
big
sarpent
you
are
not
to
suppose
however
that
by
this
name
we
wish
to
say
that
he
is
treacherous
beyond
what
is
lawful
in
a
but
that
he
is
wise
and
has
the
cunning
which
becomes
a
warrior
arrowhead
there
knows
what
i
while
the
pathfinder
was
delivering
this
address
the
two
indians
gazed
on
each
other
steadily
and
the
tuscarora
advanced
and
spoke
to
the
other
in
an
apparently
friendly
manner
i
like
to
see
this
continued
pathfinder
the
salutes
of
two
in
the
woods
master
cap
are
like
the
hailing
of
friendly
vessels
on
the
ocean
but
speaking
of
water
it
reminds
me
of
my
young
friend
jasper
western
here
who
can
claim
to
know
something
of
these
matters
seeing
that
he
has
passed
his
days
on
i
am
glad
to
see
you
friend
said
cap
giving
the
young
sailor
a
cordial
grip
though
you
must
have
something
still
to
learn
considering
the
school
to
which
you
have
been
sent
this
is
my
niece
mabel
i
call
her
magnet
for
a
reason
she
never
dreams
of
though
you
may
possibly
have
education
enough
to
guess
at
it
having
some
pretentions
to
understand
the
compass
i
the
reason
is
easily
comprehended
said
the
young
man
involuntarily
fastening
his
keen
dark
eye
at
the
same
time
on
the
suffused
face
of
the
girl
and
i
feel
sure
that
the
sailor
who
steers
by
your
magnet
will
never
make
a
bad
ha
you
do
make
use
of
some
of
the
terms
i
find
and
that
with
propriety
though
on
the
whole
i
fear
you
have
seen
more
green
than
blue
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
should
get
some
of
the
phrases
which
belong
to
the
land
for
we
are
seldom
out
of
sight
of
it
hours
at
a
more
the
pity
boy
more
the
pity
a
very
little
land
ought
to
go
a
great
way
with
a
seafaring
man
now
if
the
truth
were
known
master
western
i
suppose
there
is
more
or
less
land
all
round
your
and
uncle
is
there
not
more
or
less
land
around
the
ocean
said
magnet
quickly
for
she
dreaded
a
premature
display
of
the
old
peculiar
dogmatism
not
to
say
pedantry
no
child
there
is
more
or
less
ocean
all
round
the
land
that
what
i
tell
the
people
ashore
youngster
they
are
living
as
it
might
be
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
without
knowing
it
by
sufferance
as
it
were
the
water
being
so
much
the
more
powerful
and
the
largest
but
there
is
no
end
to
conceit
in
this
world
for
a
fellow
who
never
saw
salt
water
often
fancies
he
knows
more
than
one
who
has
gone
round
the
horn
no
no
this
earth
is
pretty
much
an
island
and
all
that
can
be
truly
said
not
to
be
so
is
young
western
had
a
profound
deference
for
a
mariner
of
the
ocean
on
which
he
had
often
pined
to
sail
but
he
had
also
a
natural
regard
for
the
broad
sheet
on
which
he
had
passed
his
life
and
which
was
not
without
its
beauties
in
his
eyes
what
you
say
sir
he
answered
modestly
may
be
true
as
to
the
atlantic
but
we
have
a
respect
for
the
land
up
here
on
that
is
because
you
are
always
returned
cap
laughing
heartily
but
yonder
is
the
pathfinder
as
they
call
him
with
some
smoking
platters
inviting
us
to
share
in
his
mess
and
i
will
confess
that
one
gets
no
venison
at
sea
master
western
civility
to
girls
at
your
time
of
life
comes
as
easy
as
taking
in
the
slack
of
the
ensign
halyards
and
if
you
will
just
keep
an
eye
to
her
kid
and
can
while
i
join
the
mess
of
the
pathfinder
and
our
indian
friends
i
make
no
doubt
she
will
remember
master
cap
uttered
more
than
he
was
aware
of
at
the
time
jasper
western
did
attend
to
the
wants
of
mabel
and
she
long
remembered
the
kind
manly
attention
of
the
young
sailor
at
this
their
first
interview
he
placed
the
end
of
a
log
for
a
seat
obtained
for
her
a
delicious
morsel
of
the
venison
gave
her
a
draught
of
pure
water
from
the
spring
and
as
he
sat
near
her
fast
won
his
way
to
her
esteem
by
his
gentle
but
frank
manner
of
manifesting
his
care
homage
that
woman
always
wishes
to
receive
but
which
is
never
so
flattering
or
so
agreeable
as
when
it
comes
from
the
young
to
those
of
their
own
age
from
the
manly
to
the
gentle
like
most
of
those
who
pass
their
time
excluded
from
the
society
of
the
softer
sex
young
western
was
earnest
sincere
and
kind
in
his
attentions
which
though
they
wanted
a
conventional
refinement
which
perhaps
mabel
never
missed
had
those
winning
qualities
that
prove
very
sufficient
as
substitutes
leaving
these
two
unsophisticated
young
people
to
become
acquainted
through
their
feelings
rather
than
their
expressed
thoughts
we
will
turn
to
the
group
in
which
the
uncle
had
already
become
a
principal
actor
the
party
had
taken
their
places
around
a
platter
of
venison
steaks
which
served
for
the
common
use
and
the
discourse
naturally
partook
of
the
characters
of
the
different
individuals
which
composed
it
the
indians
were
silent
and
industrious
the
appetite
of
the
aboriginal
american
for
venison
being
seemingly
inappeasable
while
the
two
white
men
were
communicative
each
of
the
latter
being
garrulous
and
opinionated
in
his
way
but
as
the
dialogue
will
put
the
reader
in
possession
of
certain
facts
that
may
render
the
succeeding
narrative
more
clear
it
will
be
well
to
record
it
there
must
be
satisfaction
in
this
life
of
yours
no
doubt
pathfinder
continued
cap
when
the
hunger
of
the
travellers
was
so
far
appeased
that
they
began
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
savory
morsels
it
has
some
of
the
chances
and
luck
that
we
seamen
like
and
if
ours
is
all
water
yours
is
all
nay
we
have
water
too
in
our
journeyings
and
marches
returned
his
white
companion
we
bordermen
handle
the
paddle
and
the
spear
almost
as
much
as
the
rifle
and
the
ay
but
do
you
handle
the
brace
and
the
the
wheel
and
the
the
and
the
the
paddle
is
a
good
thing
out
of
doubt
in
a
canoe
but
of
what
use
is
it
in
the
ship
nay
i
respect
all
men
in
their
callings
and
i
can
believe
the
things
you
mention
have
their
uses
one
who
has
lived
like
myself
in
company
with
many
tribes
understands
differences
in
usages
the
paint
of
a
mingo
is
not
the
paint
of
a
delaware
and
he
who
should
expect
to
see
a
warrior
in
the
dress
of
a
squaw
might
be
disappointed
i
am
not
yet
very
old
but
i
have
lived
in
the
woods
and
have
some
acquaintance
with
human
natur
i
never
believe
much
in
the
learning
of
them
that
dwell
in
towns
for
i
never
yet
met
with
one
that
had
an
eye
for
a
rifle
or
a
that
my
manner
of
reasoning
master
pathfinder
to
a
yarn
walking
about
streets
going
to
church
of
sundays
and
hearing
sermons
never
yet
made
a
man
of
a
human
being
send
the
boy
out
upon
the
broad
ocean
if
you
wish
to
open
his
eyes
and
let
him
look
upon
foreign
nations
or
what
i
call
the
face
of
nature
if
you
wish
him
to
understand
his
own
character
now
there
is
my
the
sergeant
he
is
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
broke
a
biscuit
in
his
way
but
what
is
he
after
all
why
nothing
but
a
soldier
a
sergeant
to
be
sure
but
that
is
a
sort
of
a
soldier
you
know
when
he
wished
to
marry
poor
bridget
my
sister
i
told
the
girl
what
he
was
as
in
duty
bound
and
what
she
might
expect
from
such
a
husband
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
girls
when
their
minds
are
jammed
by
an
inclination
it
is
true
the
sergeant
has
risen
in
his
calling
and
they
say
he
is
an
important
man
at
the
fort
but
his
poor
wife
has
not
lived
to
see
it
all
for
she
has
now
been
dead
these
fourteen
a
soldier
calling
is
honorable
provided
he
has
only
on
the
side
of
right
returned
the
pathfinder
and
as
the
frenchers
are
always
wrong
and
his
sacred
majesty
and
these
colonies
are
always
right
i
take
it
the
sergeant
has
a
quiet
conscience
as
well
as
a
good
character
i
have
never
slept
more
sweetly
than
when
i
have
the
mingos
though
it
is
the
law
with
me
to
fight
always
like
a
white
man
and
never
like
an
indian
the
sarpent
here
has
his
fashions
and
i
have
mine
and
yet
have
we
side
by
side
these
many
years
without
either
thinking
a
hard
thought
consarning
the
other
ways
i
tell
him
there
is
but
one
heaven
and
one
hell
notwithstanding
his
traditions
though
there
are
many
paths
to
that
is
rational
and
he
is
bound
to
believe
you
though
i
fancy
most
of
the
roads
to
the
last
are
on
dry
land
the
sea
is
what
my
poor
sister
bridget
used
to
call
a
place
and
one
is
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
when
out
of
sight
of
land
i
doubt
if
as
much
can
be
said
in
favor
of
your
lakes
up
that
towns
and
settlements
lead
to
sin
i
will
allow
but
our
lakes
are
bordered
by
the
forests
and
one
is
every
day
called
upon
to
worship
god
in
such
a
temple
that
men
are
not
always
the
same
even
in
the
wilderness
i
must
admit
for
the
difference
between
a
mingo
and
a
delaware
is
as
plain
to
be
seen
as
the
difference
between
the
sun
and
the
moon
i
am
glad
friend
cap
that
we
have
met
however
if
it
be
only
that
you
may
tell
the
big
sarpent
here
that
there
are
lakes
in
which
the
water
is
salt
we
have
been
pretty
much
of
one
mind
since
our
acquaintance
began
and
if
the
mohican
has
only
half
the
faith
in
me
that
i
have
in
him
he
believes
all
that
i
have
told
him
touching
the
white
men
ways
and
natur
laws
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
none
of
the
have
given
as
free
a
belief
as
an
honest
man
likes
to
the
accounts
of
the
big
salt
lakes
and
to
that
of
their
being
rivers
that
flow
up
this
comes
of
getting
things
wrong
end
foremost
answered
cap
with
a
condescending
nod
you
have
thought
of
your
lakes
and
rifts
as
the
ship
and
of
the
ocean
and
the
tides
as
the
boat
neither
arrowhead
nor
the
serpent
need
doubt
what
you
have
said
concerning
both
though
i
confess
myself
to
some
difficulty
in
swallowing
the
tale
about
there
being
inland
seas
at
all
and
still
more
that
there
is
any
sea
of
fresh
water
i
have
come
this
long
journey
as
much
to
satisfy
my
own
eyes
concerning
these
facts
as
to
oblige
the
sergeant
and
magnet
though
the
first
was
my
sister
husband
and
i
love
the
last
like
a
you
are
wrong
friend
cap
very
wrong
to
distrust
the
power
of
god
in
any
thing
returned
pathfinder
earnestly
they
that
live
in
the
settlements
and
the
towns
have
confined
and
unjust
opinions
consarning
the
might
of
his
hand
but
we
who
pass
our
time
in
his
very
presence
as
it
might
be
see
things
differently
i
mean
such
of
us
as
have
white
natur
a
has
his
notions
and
it
is
right
that
it
should
be
so
and
if
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
as
a
christian
white
man
there
is
no
harm
in
it
still
there
are
matters
which
belong
altogether
to
the
ordering
of
god
providence
and
these
salt
and
lakes
are
some
of
them
i
do
not
pretend
to
account
for
these
things
but
i
think
it
the
duty
of
all
to
believe
in
hold
on
there
master
pathfinder
interrupted
cap
not
without
some
heat
in
the
way
of
a
proper
and
manly
faith
i
will
turn
my
back
on
no
one
when
afloat
although
more
accustomed
to
make
all
snug
aloft
and
to
show
the
proper
canvas
than
to
pray
when
the
hurricane
comes
i
know
that
we
are
but
helpless
mortals
at
times
and
i
hope
i
pay
reverence
where
reverence
is
due
all
i
mean
to
say
is
this
that
being
accustomed
to
see
water
in
large
bodies
salt
i
should
like
to
taste
it
before
i
can
believe
it
to
be
god
has
given
the
salt
lick
to
the
deer
and
he
has
given
to
man
and
white
the
delicious
spring
at
which
to
slake
his
thirst
it
is
unreasonable
to
think
that
he
may
not
have
given
lakes
of
pure
water
to
the
west
and
lakes
of
impure
water
to
the
cap
was
awed
in
spite
of
his
overweening
dogmatism
by
the
earnest
simplicity
of
the
pathfinder
though
he
did
not
relish
the
idea
of
believing
a
fact
which
for
many
years
he
had
pertinaciously
insisted
could
not
be
true
unwilling
to
give
up
the
point
and
at
the
same
time
unable
to
maintain
it
against
a
reasoning
to
which
he
was
unaccustomed
and
which
possessed
equally
the
force
of
truth
faith
and
probability
he
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
subject
by
evasion
well
well
friend
pathfinder
said
he
we
will
leave
the
argument
where
it
is
and
we
can
try
the
water
when
we
once
reach
it
only
mark
my
words
i
do
not
say
that
it
may
not
be
fresh
on
the
surface
the
atlantic
is
sometimes
fresh
on
the
surface
near
the
mouths
of
great
rivers
but
rely
on
it
i
shall
show
you
a
way
of
tasting
the
water
many
fathoms
deep
of
which
you
never
dreamed
and
then
we
shall
know
more
about
the
guide
seemed
content
to
let
the
matter
rest
and
the
conversation
changed
we
are
not
consarning
our
gifts
observed
the

after
a
short
pause
and

that

we

our

they

are
not

by
vanity
and
wantonness

is

must
be
something
about
these

you
speak

all

this

i
will
acknowledge
has
overlaid
all
my
seamanship
arrowhead
there
said
the
smoke
came
from
a
fire
and
that
is
a
piece
of
philosophy
which
i
hold
to
be
equal
to
steering
in
a
dark
night
by
the
edges
of
the
it
no
great
secret
returned
pathfinder
laughing
with
great
inward
glee
though
habitual
caution
prevented
the
emission
of
any
noise
nothing
is
easier
to
us
who
pass
our
time
in
the
great
school
of
providence
than
to
larn
its
lessons
we
should
be
as
useless
on
a
trail
or
in
carrying
tidings
through
the
wilderness
as
so
many
woodchucks
did
we
not
soon
come
to
a
knowledge
of
these
niceties
as
we
call
him
is
so
fond
of
the
water
that
he
gathered
a
damp
stick
or
two
for
our
fire
and
wet
will
bring
dark
smoke
as
i
suppose
even
you
followers
of
the
sea
must
know
it
no
great
secret
though
all
is
mystery
to
such
as
does
study
the
lord
and
his
mighty
ways
with
humility
and
that
must
be
a
keen
eye
of
arrowhead
to
see
so
slight
a

would
be
but
a
poor
indian
if
he
did
no
no
it
is
and
no
is
outlying
without
using
his
senses
every
skin
has
its
own
natur
and
every
natur
has
its
own
laws
as
well
as
its
own
skin
it
was
many
years
before
i
could
master
all
these
higher
branches
of
a
forest
education
for
knowledge
does
come
as
easy
to
natur
as
what
i
suppose
is
intended
to
be
knowledge
though
i
have
but
little
of
the
latter
having
passed
most
of
my
time
in
the
you
have
been
a
ready
scholar
master
pathfinder
as
is
seen
by
your
understanding
these
things
so
well
i
suppose
it
would
be
no
great
matter
for
a
man
regularly
brought
up
to
the
sea
to
catch
these
trifles
if
he
could
only
bring
his
mind
fairly
to
bear
upon
i
do
know
that
the
white
man
has
his
difficulties
in
getting
habits
quite
as
much
as
the
indian
in
getting
ways
as
for
the
real
natur
it
is
my
opinion
that
neither
can
actually
get
that
of
the
and
yet
we
sailors
who
run
about
the
world
so
much
say
there
is
but
one
nature
whether
it
be
in
the
chinaman
or
a
dutchman
for
my
own
part
i
am
much
of
that
way
of
thinking
too
for
i
have
generally
found
that
all
nations
like
gold
and
silver
and
most
men
relish
then
you
seafaring
men
know
little
of
the
have
you
ever
known
any
of
your
chinamen
who
could
sing
their
with
their
flesh
torn
with
splinters
and
cut
with
knives
the
fire
raging
around
their
naked
bodies
and
death
staring
them
in
the
face
until
you
can
find
me
a
chinaman
or
a
christian
man
that
can
do
all
this
you
can
not
find
a
man
with
a
natur
let
him
look
ever
so
valiant
or
know
how
to
read
all
the
books
that
were
ever
it
is
the
savages
only
that
play
each
other
such
hellish
tricks
said
master
cap
glancing
his
eyes
about
him
uneasily
at
the
apparently
endless
arches
of
the
forest
no
white
man
is
ever
condemned
to
undergo
these
nay
therein
you
are
again
mistaken
returned
the
pathfinder
coolly
selecting
a
delicate
morsel
of
the
venison
as
his
for
though
these
torments
belong
only
to
the
natur
in
the
way
of
bearing
them
like
braves
natur
may
be
and
often
has
been
agonized
by
happily
said
cap
with
an
effort
to
clear
his
throat
none
of
his
majesty
allies
will
be
likely
to
attempt
such
damnable
cruelties
on
any
of
his
majesty
loyal
subjects
i
have
not
served
much
in
the
royal
navy
it
is
true
but
i
have
served
and
that
is
something
and
in
the
way
of
privateering
and
worrying
the
enemy
in
his
ships
and
cargoes
i
done
my
full
share
but
i
trust
there
are
no
french
savages
on
this
side
the
lake
and
i
think
you
said
that
ontario
is
a
broad
sheet
of
water
nay
it
is
broad
in
our
eyes
returned
pathfinder
not
caring
to
conceal
the
smile
which
lighted
a
face
which
had
been
burnt
by
exposure
to
a
bright
red
though
i
mistrust
that
some
may
think
it
narrow
and
narrow
it
is
if
you
wish
it
to
keep
off
the
foe
ontario
has
two
ends
and
the
enemy
that
is
afraid
to
cross
it
will
be
certain
to
come
round
ah
that
comes
of
your
d
d
ponds
growled
cap
hemming
so
loudly
as
to
cause
him
instantly
to
repent
the
indiscretion
no
man
now
ever
heard
of
a
pirate
or
a
ship
getting
round
one
end
of
the
atlantic
mayhap
the
ocean
has
no
ends
that
it
has
nor
sides
nor
bottom
the
nation
which
is
snugly
moored
on
one
of
its
coasts
need
fear
nothing
from
the
one
anchored
abeam
let
it
be
ever
so
savage
unless
it
possesses
the
art
of
ship
building
no
no
the
people
who
live
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
need
fear
but
little
for
their
skins
or
their
scalps
a
man
may
lie
down
at
night
in
those
regions
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
hair
on
his
head
in
the
morning
unless
he
wears
a
it
is
so
here
i
do
wish
to
flurry
the
young
woman
and
therefore
i
will
be
in
no
way
particular
though
she
seems
pretty
much
listening
to
as
we
call
him
but
without
the
edication
i
have
received
i
should
think
it
at
this
very
moment
a
risky
journey
to
go
over
the
very
ground
that
lies
between
us
and
the
garrison
in
the
present
state
of
this
frontier
there
are
about
as
many
iroquois
on
this
side
of
ontario
as
there
are
on
the
other
it
is
for
this
very
reason
friend
cap
that
the
sergeant
has
engaged
us
to
come
out
and
show
you
the
what
do
the
knaves
dare
to
cruise
so
near
the
guns
of
one
of
his
majesty
works
do
not
the
ravens
resort
near
the
carcass
of
the
deer
though
the
fowler
is
at
hand
they
come
as
it
might
be
naturally
there
are
more
or
less
whites
passing
between
the
forts
and
the
settlements
and
they
are
sure
to
be
on
their
trails
the
sarpent
has
come
up
one
side
of
the
river
and
i
have
come
up
the
other
in
order
to
scout
for
the
outlying
rascals
while
jasper
brought
up
the
canoe
like
a
sailor
as
he
is
the
sergeant
told
him
with
tears
in
his
eyes
all
about
his
child
and
how
his
heart
yearned
for
her
and
how
gentle
and
obedient
she
was
until
i
think
the
lad
would
have
dashed
into
a
mingo
camp
rather
than
not
we
thank
him
and
shall
think
the
better
of
him
for
his
readiness
though
i
suppose
the
boy
has
run
no
great
risk
after
only
the
risk
of
being
shot
from
a
cover
as
he
forced
the
canoe
up
a
swift
rift
or
turned
an
elbow
in
the
stream
with
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
eddies
of
all
the
risky
journeys
that
on
an
ambushed
river
is
the
most
risky
in
my
judgment
and
that
risk
has
jasper
and
why
the
devil
has
the
sergeant
sent
for
me
to
travel
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
this
outlandish
manner
give
me
an
offing
and
the
enemy
in
sight
and
i
play
with
him
in
his
own
fashion
as
long
as
he
pleases
long
bows
or
close
quarters
but
to
be
shot
like
a
turtle
asleep
is
not
to
my
humor
if
it
were
not
for
little
magnet
there
i
would
tack
ship
this
instant
make
the
best
of
my
way
back
to
york
and
let
ontario
take
care
of
itself
salt
water
or
fresh
that
would
mend
the
matter
much
friend
mariner
as
the
road
to
return
is
much
longer
and
almost
as
bad
as
the
road
to
go
on
trust
to
us
and
we
will
carry
you
through
safely
or
lose
our
cap
wore
a
tight
solid
queue
done
up
in
eelskin
while
the
top
of
his
head
was
nearly
bald
and
he
mechanically
passed
his
hand
over
both
as
if
to
make
certain
that
each
was
in
its
right
place
he
was
at
the
bottom
however
a
brave
man
and
had
often
faced
death
with
coolness
though
never
in
the
frightful
forms
in
which
it
presented
itself
under
the
brief
but
graphic
picture
of
his
companion
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
and
he
determined
to
put
the
best
face
on
the
matter
though
he
could
not
avoid
muttering
inwardly
a
few
curses
on
the
indiscretion
with
which
his
the
sergeant
had
led
him
into
his
present
dilemma
i
make
no
doubt
master
pathfinder
he
answered
when
these
thoughts
had
found
time
to
glance
through
his
mind
that
we
shall
reach
port
in
safety
what
distance
may
we
now
be
from
the
fort
little
more
than
fifteen
miles
and
swift
miles
too
as
the
river
runs
if
the
mingos
let
us
go
and
i
suppose
the
woods
will
stretch
along
starboard
and
larboard
as
heretofore
anan
i
mean
that
we
shall
have
to
pick
our
way
through
these
damned
nay
nay
you
will
go
in
the
canoe
and
the
oswego
has
been
cleared
of
its
by
the
troops
it
will
be
floating
down
stream
and
that
too
with
a
swift
and
what
the
devil
is
to
prevent
these
minks
of
which
you
speak
from
shooting
us
as
we
double
a
headland
or
are
busy
in
steering
clear
of
the
rocks
the
lord
he
who
has
so
often
helped
others
in
greater
difficulties
many
and
many
is
the
time
that
my
head
would
have
been
stripped
of
hair
skin
and
all
had
the
lord
of
my
side
i
never
go
into
a
skrimmage
friend
mariner
without
thinking
of
this
great
ally
who
can
do
more
in
battle
than
all
the
battalions
of
the
were
they
brought
into
a
single
ay
ay
this
may
do
well
enough
for
a
scouter
but
we
seamen
like
our
offing
and
to
go
into
action
with
nothing
in
our
minds
but
the
business
before
us
plain
broadside
and
broadside
work
and
no
trees
or
rocks
to
thicken
the
and
no
lord
too
i
dare
to
say
if
the
truth
were
known
take
my
word
for
it
master
cap
that
no
battle
is
the
worse
for
having
the
lord
on
your
side
look
at
the
head
of
the
big
sarpent
there
you
can
see
the
mark
of
a
knife
all
along
by
his
left
ear
now
nothing
but
a
bullet
from
this
long
rifle
of
mine
saved
his
scalp
that
day
for
it
had
fairly
started
and
half
a
minute
more
would
have
left
him
without
the
when
the
mohican
squeezes
my
hand
and
intermates
that
i
befriended
him
in
that
matter
i
tell
him
no
it
was
the
lord
who
led
me
to
the
only
spot
where
execution
could
be
done
or
his
necessity
be
made
known
on
account
of
the
smoke
sartain
when
i
got
the
right
position
i
finished
the
affair
of
my
own
accord
for
a
friend
under
the
tomahawk
is
apt
to
make
a
man
think
quick
and
act
at
once
as
was
my
case
or
the
sarpent
spirit
would
be
hunting
in
the
happy
land
of
his
people
at
this
very
come
come
pathfinder
this
palaver
is
worse
than
being
skinned
from
stem
to
stem
we
have
but
a
few
hours
of
sun
and
had
better
be
drifting
down
this
said
current
of
yours
while
we
may
magnet

are
you
not
ready
to
get
under

magnet
started
blushed
brightly
and
made
her
preparations
for
immediate
departure
not
a
syllable
of
the
discourse
just
related
had
she
heard
for
as
young
jasper
was
oftener
called
than
anything
else
had
been
filling
her
ears
with
a
description
of
the
yet
distant
part
towards
which
she
was
journeying
with
accounts
of
her
father
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
a
child
and
with
the
manner
of
life
of
those
who
lived
in
the
frontier
garrisons
unconsciously
she
had
become
deeply
interested
and
her
thoughts
had
been
too
intently
directed
to
these
matters
to
allow
any
of
the
less
agreeable
subjects
discussed
by
those
so
near
to
reach
her
ears
the
bustle
of
departure
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
and
the
baggage
of
the
scouts
or
guides
being
trifling
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
party
was
ready
to
proceed
as
they
were
about
to
quit
the
spot
however
to
the
surprise
of
even
his
pathfinder
collected
a
quantity
of
branches
and
threw
them
upon
the
embers
of
the
fire
taking
care
even
to
see
that
some
of
the
wood
was
damp
in
order
to
raise
as
dark
and
dense
a
smoke
as
possible
when
you
can
hide
your
trail
jasper
said
he
a
smoke
at
leaving
an
encampment
may
do
good
instead
of
harm
if
there
are
a
dozen
mingos
within
ten
miles
of
us
some
of
are
on
the
heights
or
in
the
trees
looking
out
for
smokes
let
them
see
this
and
much
good
may
it
do
them
they
are
welcome
to
our
but
may
they
not
strike
and
follow
on
our
trail
asked
the
youth
whose
interest
in
the
hazard
of
his
situation
had
much
increased
since
the
meeting
with
magnet
we
shall
leave
a
broad
path
to
the
the
broader
the
better
when
there
it
will
surpass
mingo
cunning
even
to
say
which
way
the
canoe
has
gone
up
stream
or
down
water
is
the
only
thing
in
natur
that
will
thoroughly
wash
out
a
trail
and
even
water
will
not
always
do
it
when
the
scent
is
strong
do
you
not
see
that
if
any
mingos
have
seen
our
path
below
the
falls
they
will
strike
off
towards
this
smoke
and
that
they
will
naturally
conclude
that
they
who
began
by
going
up
stream
will
end
by
going
up
stream
if
they
know
anything
they
now
know
a
party
is
out
from
the
fort
and
it
will
exceed
even
mingo
wit
to
fancy
that
we
have
come
up
here
just
for
the
pleasure
of
going
back
again
and
that
too
the
same
day
and
at
the
risk
of
our
certainly
added
jasper
who
was
talking
apart
with
the
pathfinder
as
they
moved
towards
the
they
can
not
know
anything
about
the
sergeant
daughter
for
the
greatest
secrecy
has
been
observed
on
her
and
they
will
learn
nothing
here
returned
pathfinder
causing
his
companion
to
see
that
he
trod
with
the
utmost
care
on
the
impression
left
on
the
leaves
by
the
little
foot
of
mabel
unless
this
old
fish
has
been
taking
his
niece
about
in
the
like
a
playing
by
the
side
of
the
old
buck
you
mean
is
he
a
queerity
now
i
can
consort
with
such
a
sailor
as
yourself
and
find
nothing
very
contrary
in
our
gifts
though
yours
belong
to
the
lakes
and
mine
to
the
woods
jasper
continued
the
scout
laughing
in
his
noiseless
manner
suppose
we
try
the
temper
of
his
blade
and
run
him
over
the
falls
and
what
would
be
done
with
the
pretty
niece
in
the
meanwhile
nay
nay
no
harm
shall
come
to
her
she
must
walk
round
the
portage
at
any
rate
but
you
and
i
can
try
this
atlantic
oceaner
and
then
all
parties
will
become
better
acquainted
we
shall
find
out
whether
his
flint
will
strike
fire
and
he
may
come
to
know
something
of
frontier
young
jasper
smiled
for
he
was
not
averse
to
fun
and
had
been
a
little
touched
by
cap
superciliousness
but
mabel
fair
face
light
agile
form
and
winning
smiles
stood
like
a
shield
between
her
uncle
and
the
intended
experiment
perhaps
the
sergeant
daughter
will
be
frightened
said
he
not
she
if
she
has

jasper
laughed
nodded
his

by
way
of

then
the

was
dropped

of

pursues
its
way
through
a
gently
undulating
country
some
eight
or
ten
miles
until
it
reaches
the
margin
of
a
sort
of
natural
terrace
down
which
it
tumbles
some
ten
or
fifteen

another

it
glides
with
the
silent
stealthy

had
travelled
from

now
entered

said
the
man
of

to
the
young
mariner
of
the

who
had
dispossessed

of
his

and
taken
his
own

it

should
any
of
these
infarnals
the

strike
our
trail
or
follow
it
to
this
point
they
will
not
fail
to
look
for
the
signs
in
the
mud
and
if
they
discover
that
we
have
left
the
shore
with
the
nose
of
the

up

it
is
a
natural
belief
to
think
we
went
up
this
direction
was
followed
and
giving
a
vigorous
shove
the
pathfinder
who
was
in
the
flower
of
his
strength
and
activity
made
a
leap
landing
lightly
and
without
disturbing
its
equilibrium
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
as
soon
as
it
had
reached
the
centre
of
the
river
or
the
strength
of
the
current
the
boat
was
turned
and
it
began
to
glide
noiselessly
down
the
stream
the
vessel
in
which
cap
and
his
niece
had
embarked
for
their
long
and
adventurous
journey
was
one
of
the
canoes
of
bark
which
the
indians
are
in
the
habit
of
constructing
and
which
by
their
exceeding
lightness
and
the
ease
with
which
they
are
propelled
are
admirably
adapted
to
a
navigation
in
which
shoals
and
other
similar
obstructions
so
often
occur
the
two
men
who
composed
its
original
crew
had
several
times
carried
it
when
emptied
of
its
luggage
many
hundred
yards
and
it
would
not
have
exceeded
the
strength
of
a
single
man
to
lift
its
weight
still
it
was
long
and
for
a
canoe
wide
a
want
of
steadiness
being
its
principal
defect
in
the
eyes
of
the
uninitiated
a
few
hours
practice
however
in
a
great
measure
remedied
this
evil
and
both
mabel
and
her
uncle
had
learned
so
far
to
humor
its
movements
that
they
now
maintained
their
places
with
perfect
composure
nor
did
the
additional
weight
of
the
three
guides
tax
its
power
in
any
particular
degree
the
breath
of
the
rounded
bottom
allowing
the
necessary
quantity
of
water
to
be
displaced
without
bringing
the
gunwale
very
sensibly
nearer
to
the
surface
of
the
stream
its
workmanship
was
neat
the
timbers
were
small
and
secured
by
thongs
and
the
whole
fabric
though
it
was
so
slight
to
the
eye
was
probably
capable
of
conveying
double
the
number
of
persons
which
it
now
contained
cap
was
seated
on
a
low
thwart
in
the
centre
of
the
canoe
the
big
serpent
knelt
near
him
arrowhead
and
his
wife
occupied
places
forward
of
both
the
former
having
relinquished
his
post
aft
mabel
was
half
reclining
behind
her
uncle
while
the
pathfinder
and
stood
erect
the
one
in
the
bow
and
the
other
in
the
stern
each
using
a
paddle
with
a
long
steady
noiseless
sweep
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
low
tones
all
the
party
beginning
to
feel
the
necessity
of
prudence
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
outskirts
of
the
fort
and
had
no
longer
the
cover
of
the
woods
the
oswego
just
at
that
place
was
a
deep
dark
stream
of
no
great
width
its
still
current
winding
its
way
among
overhanging
trees
which
in
particular
spots
almost
shut
out
the
light
of
the
heavens
here
and
there
some
giant
of
the
forest
lay
nearly
across
its
surface
rendering
care
necessary
to
avoid
the
limbs
and
most
of
the
distance
the
lower
branches
and
leaves
of
the
trees
of
smaller
growth
were
laved
by
its
waters
the
picture
so
beautifully
described
by
our
own
admirable
poet
and
which
we
have
placed
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
was
here
realized
the
earth
fattened
by
the
decayed
vegetation
of
centuries
and
black
with
loam
the
stream
that
filled
the
banks
nearly
to
overflowing
and
the
fresh
and
boundless
wood
being
all
as
visible
to
the
eye
as
the
pen
of
bryant
has
elsewhere
vividly
presented
them
to
the
imagination
in
short
the
entire
scene
was
one
of
a
rich
and
benevolent
nature
before
it
had
been
subjected
to
the
uses
and
desires
of
man
luxuriant
wild
full
of
promise
and
not
without
the
charm
of
the
picturesque
even
in
its
rudest
state
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
was
in
the
year
or
long
before
even
speculation
had
brought
any
portion
of
western
new
york
within
the
bounds
of
civilization
at
that
distant
day
there
were
two
great
channels
of
military
communication
between
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
colony
of
new
york
and
the
frontiers
which
lay
adjacent
to
the
canadas
that
by
lakes
champlain
and
george
and
that
by
means
of
the
mohawk
wood
creek
the
oneida
and
the
rivers
we
have
been
describing
along
both
these
lines
of
communication
military
posts
had
been
established
though
there
existed
a
blank
space
of
a
hundred
miles
between
the
last
fort
at
the
head
of
the
mohawk
and
the
outlet
of
the
oswego
which
embraced
most
of
the
distance
that
cap
and
mabel
had
journeyed
under
the
protection
of
arrowhead
i
sometimes
wish
for
peace
again
said
the
pathfinder
when
one
can
range
the
forest
without
searching
for
any
other
enemy
than
the
beasts
and
fishes
ah
me
many
is
the
day
that
the
sarpent
there
and
i
have
passed
happily
among
the
streams
living
on
venison
salmon
and
trout
without
thought
of
a
mingo
or
a
scalp
i
sometimes
wish
that
them
blessed
days
might
come
back
for
it
is
not
my
real
gift
to
slay
my
own
kind
i
sartain
the
sergeant
daughter
do
think
me
a
wretch
that
takes
pleasure
in
preying
on
human
natur
as
this
remark
a
sort
of
half
interrogatory
was
made
pathfinder
looked
behind
him
and
though
the
most
partial
friend
could
scarcely
term
his
sunburnt
and
hard
features
handsome
even
mabel
thought
his
smile
attractive
by
its
simple
ingenuousness
and
the
uprightness
that
beamed
in
every
lineament
of
his
honest
countenance
i
do
not
think
my
father
would
have
sent
one
like
those
you
mention
to
see
his
daughter
through
the
wilderness
the
young
woman
answered
returning
the
smile
as
frankly
as
it
was
given
but
much
more
sweetly
that
he
would
the
sergeant
is
a
man
of
feeling
and
many
is
the
march
and
the
fight
that
we
have
had
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
as
would
call
it
though
i
always
keep
my
limbs
free
when
near
a
frencher
or
a
you
are
then
the
young
friend
of
whom
my
father
has
spoken
so
often
in
his
letters
his
friend
the
sergeant
has
the
advantage
of
me
by
thirty
years
yes
he
is
thirty
years
my
senior
and
as
many
my
not
in
the
eyes
of
the
daughter
perhaps
friend
pathfinder
put
in
cap
whose
spirits
began
to
revive
when
he
found
the
water
once
more
flowing
around
him
the
thirty
years
that
you
mention
are
not
often
thought
to
be
an
advantage
in
the
eyes
of
girls
of
mabel
colored
and
in
turning
aside
her
face
to
avoid
the
looks
of
those
in
the
bow
of
the
canoe
she
encountered
the
admiring
gaze
of
the
young
man
in
the
stern
as
a
last
resource
her
spirited
but
soft
blue
eyes
sought
refuge
in
the
water
just
at
this
moment
a
dull
heavy
sound
swept
up
the
avenue
formed
by
the
trees
borne
along
by
a
light
air
that
hardly
produced
a
ripple
on
the
water
that
sounds
pleasantly
said
cap
pricking
up
his
ears
like
a
dog
that
hears
a
distant
baying
it
is
the
surf
on
the
shores
of
your
lake
i
suppose
not
so
not
so
answered
the
pathfinder
it
is
merely
this
river
tumbling
over
some
rocks
half
a
mile
below
is
there
a
fall
in
the
stream
demanded
mabel
a
still
brighter
flush
glowing
in
her
face
the
devil
master
pathfinder
or
you
for
so
cap
began
to
style
jasper
had
you
not
better
give
the
canoe
a
sheer
and
get
nearer
to
the
shore
these
waterfalls
have
generally
rapids
above
them
and
one
might
as
well
get
into
the
maelstrom
at
once
as
to
run
into
their
trust
to
us
friend
cap
answered
pathfinder
we
are
but
sailors
it
is
true
and
i
can
not
boast
of
being
much
even
of
that
but
we
understand
rifts
and
rapids
and
cataracts
and
in
going
down
these
we
shall
do
our
endeavors
not
to
disgrace
our
in
going
down
exclaimed
cap
the
devil
man
you
do
not
dream
of
going
down
a
waterfall
in
this
egg
shell
of
bark
sartain
the
path
lies
over
the
falls
and
it
is
much
easier
to
shoot
them
than
to
unload
the
canoe
and
to
carry
that
and
all
it
contains
around
a
portage
of
a
mile
by
mabel
turned
her
pallid
countenance
towards
the
young
man
in
the
stern
of
the
canoe
for
just
at
that
moment
a
fresh
roar
of
the
fall
was
borne
to
her
ears
by
a
new
current
of
the
air
and
it
really
sounded
terrific
now
that
the
cause
was
understood
we
thought
that
by
landing
the
females
and
the
two
indians
jasper
quietly
observed
we
three
white
men
all
of
whom
are
used
to
the
water
might
carry
the
canoe
over
in
safety
for
we
often
shoot
these
and
we
counted
on
you
friend
mariner
as
a
mainstay
said
pathfinder
winking
to
jasper
over
his
shoulder
for
you
are
accustomed
to
see
waves
tumbling
about
and
without
some
one
to
steady
the
cargo
all
the
finery
of
the
sergeant
daughter
might
be
washed
into
the
river
and
be
cap
was
puzzled
the
idea
of
going
over
a
waterfall
was
perhaps
more
serious
in
his
eyes
than
it
would
have
been
in
those
of
one
totally
ignorant
of
all
that
pertained
to
boats
for
he
understood
the
power
of
the
element
and
the
total
feebleness
of
man
when
exposed
to
its
fury
still
his
pride
revolted
at
the
thought
of
deserting
the
boat
while
others
not
only
steadily
but
coolly
proposed
to
continue
in
it
notwithstanding
the
latter
feeling
and
his
innate
as
well
as
acquired
steadiness
in
danger
he
would
probably
have
deserted
his
post
had
not
the
images
of
indians
tearing
scalps
from
the
human
head
taken
so
strong
hold
of
his
fancy
as
to
induce
him
to
imagine
the
canoe
a
sort
of
sanctuary
what
is
to
be
done
with
magnet
he
demanded
affection
for
his
niece
raising
another
qualm
in
his
conscience
we
can
not
allow
magnet
to
land
if
there
are
enemy
indians
near
nay
no
mingo
will
be
near
the
portage
for
that
is
a
spot
too
public
for
their
devilries
answered
the
pathfinder
confidently
is
natur
and
it
is
an
indian
natur
to
be
found
where
he
is
least
expected
no
fear
of
him
on
a
beaten
path
for
he
wishes
to
come
upon
you
when
unprepared
to
meet
him
and
the
fiery
villains
make
it
a
point
to
deceive
you
one
way
or
another
sheer
in
and
we
will
land
the
sergeant
daughter
on
the
end
of
that
log
where
she
can
reach
the
shore
with
a
dry
the
injunction
was
obeyed
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
party
had
left
the
canoe
with
the
exception
of
pathfinder
and
the
two
sailors
notwithstanding
his
professional
pride
cap
would
have
gladly
followed
but
he
did
not
like
to
exhibit
so
unequivocal
a
weakness
in
the
presence
of
a
sailor
i
call
all
hands
to
witness
said
he
as
those
who
had
landed
moved
away
that
i
do
not
look
on
this
affair
as
anything
more
than
canoeing
in
the
woods
there
is
no
seamanship
in
tumbling
over
a
waterfall
which
is
a
feat
the
greatest
lubber
can
perform
as
well
as
the
oldest
nay
nay
you
need
despise
the
oswego
falls
neither
put
in
pathfinder
for
though
they
may
not
be
niagara
nor
the
genessee
nor
the
cahoos
nor
glenn
nor
those
on
the
canada
they
are
narvous
enough
for
a
new
beginner
let
the
sergeant
daughter
stand
on
yonder
rock
and
she
will
see
the
manner
in
which
we
ignorant
backwoodsmen
get
over
a
difficulty
that
we
ca
get
under
now
a
steady
hand
and
a
true
eye
for
all
rests
on
you
seeing
that
we
can
count
master
cap
for
no
more
than
a
the
canoe
was
leaving
the
shore
as
he
concluded
while
mabel
went
hurriedly
and
trembling
to
the
rock
that
had
been
pointed
out
talking
to
her
companion
of
the
danger
her
uncle
so
unnecessarily
ran
while
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
agile
and
vigorous
form
of
as
he
stood
erect
in
the
stern
of
the
light
boat
governing
its
movements
as
soon
however
as
she
reached
a
point
where
she
got
a
view
of
the
fall
she
gave
an
involuntary
but
suppressed
scream
and
covered
her
eyes
at
the
next
instant
the
latter
were
again
free
and
the
entranced
girl
stood
immovable
as
a
statue
a
scarcely
breathing
observer
of
all
that
passed
the
two
indians
seated
themselves
passively
on
a
log
hardly
looking
towards
the
stream
while
the
wife
of
arrowhead
came
near
mabel
and
appeared
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
canoe
with
some
such
interest
as
a
child
regards
the
leaps
of
a
tumbler
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
in
the
stream
pathfinder
sank
on
his
knees
continuing
to
use
the
paddle
though
it
was
slowly
and
in
a
manner
not
to
interfere
with
the
efforts
of
his
companion
the
latter
still
stood
erect
and
as
he
kept
his
eye
on
some
object
beyond
the
fall
it
was
evident
that
he
was
carefully
looking
for
the
spot
proper
for
their
passage
farther

boy
farther
west
muttered
pathfinder
there
where
you
see

water

bring

of
the
dead
oak
in
a
line

stem
of

blasted

no
answer
for
the
canoe
was
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
with
its
head
pointed
towards
the
fall
and
it
had
already
begun
to
quicken
its
motion
by
the
increased
force
of
the
current
at
that
moment
cap
would
cheerfully
have
renounced
every
claim
to
glory
that
could
possibly
be
acquired
by
the
feat
to
have
been
safe
again
on
shore
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
water
thundering
as
it
might
be
behind
a
screen
but
becoming
more
and
more
distinct
louder
and
louder
and
before
him
he
saw
its
line
cutting
the
forest
below
along
which
the
green
and
angry
element
seemed
stretched
and
shining
as
if
the
particles
were
about
to
lose
their
principle
of
cohesion
down
with
your
helm
down
with
your
helm
man
he
exclaimed
unable
any
longer
to
suppress
his
anxiety
as
the
canoe
glided
towards
the
edge
of
the
fall
ay
ay
down
it
is
sure
enough
answered
pathfinder
looking
behind
him
for
a
single
instant
with
his
silent
joyous
laugh
down
we
go
of
a
sartinty
heave
her
starn
up
boy
farther
up
with
her
starn
the
rest
was
like
the
passage
of
the
viewless
wind
gave
the
required
sweep
with
his
paddle
the
canoe
glanced
into
the
channel
and
for
a
few
seconds
it
seemed
to
cap
that
he
was
tossing
in
a
caldron
he
felt
the
bow
of
the
canoe
tip
saw
the
raging
foaming
water
careering
madly
by
his
side
was
sensible
that
the
light
fabric
in
which
he
floated
was
tossed
about
like
an
and
then
not
less
to
his
great
joy
than
to
his
surprise
he
discovered
that
it
was
gliding
across
the
basin
of
still
water
below
the
fall
under
the
steady
impulse
of
jasper
paddle
the
pathfinder
continued
to
laugh
but
he
arose
from
his
knees
and
searching
for
a
tin
pot
and
a
horn
spoon
he
began
deliberately
to
measure
the
water
that
had
been
taken
in
the
passage
fourteen
spoonfuls
fourteen
fairly
measured
spoonfuls
i
have
you
must
acknowledge
known
you
to
go
down
with
only
master
cap
leaned
so
hard
up
stream
returned
jasper
seriously
that
i
had
difficulty
in
trimming
the
it
may
be
so
no
doubt
it
so
since
you
say
it
but
i
have
known
you
go
over
with
only
cap
now
gave
a
tremendous
hem
felt
for
his
queue
as
if
to
ascertain
its
safety
and
then
looked
back
in
order
to
examine
the
danger
he
had
gone
through
his
safety
is
easily
explained
most
of
the
river
fell
perpendicularly
ten
or
twelve
feet
but
near
its
centre
the
force
of
the
current
had
so
far
worn
away
the
rock
as
to
permit
the
water
to
shoot
through
a
narrow
passage
at
an
angle
of
about
forty
or
forty
five
degrees
down
this
ticklish
descent
the
canoe
had
glanced
amid
fragments
of
broken
rock
whirlpools
foam
and
furious
tossings
of
the
element
which
an
uninstructed
eye
would
believe
menaced
inevitable
destruction
to
an
object
so
fragile
but
the
very
lightness
of
the
canoe
had
favored
its
descent
for
borne
on
the
crest
of
the
waves
and
directed
by
a
steady
eye
and
an
arm
full
of
muscle
it
had
passed
like
a
feather
from
one
pile
of
foam
to
another
scarcely
permitting
its
glossy
side
to
be
wetted
there
were
a
few
rocks
to
be
avoided
the
proper
direction
was
to
be
rigidly
observed
and
the
fierce
current
did
the
rest
lest
the
reader
suppose
we
are
dealing
purely
in
fiction
the
writer
will
add
that
he
has
known
a
long
pounder
carried
over
these
same
falls
in
perfect
safety
to
say
that
cap
was
astonished
would
not
be
expressing
half
his
feelings
he
felt
awed
for
the
profound
dread
of
rocks
which
most
seamen
entertain
came
in
aid
of
his
admiration
of
the
boldness
of
the
exploit
still
he
was
indisposed
to
express
all
he
felt
lest
it
might
be
conceding
too
much
in
favor
of
fresh
water
and
inland
navigation
and
no
sooner
had
he
cleared
his
throat
with
the
hem
than
he
loosened
his
tongue
in
the
usual
strain
of
superiority
i
do
not
gainsay
your
knowledge
of
the
channel
master
and
after
all
to
know
the
channel
in
such
a
place
is
the
main
point
i
have
had
cockswains
with
me
who
could
come
down
that
shoot
too
if
they
only
knew
the
it
is
enough
to
know
the
channel
said
pathfinder
it
needs
narves
and
skill
to
keep
the
canoe
straight
and
to
keep
her
clear
of
the
rocks
too
there
is
another
boatman
in
all
this
region
that
can
shoot
the
oswego
but
there
with
any
sartainty
though
now
and
then
one
has
blundered
through
i
ca
do
it
myself
unless
by
means
of
providence
and
it
needs
jasper
hand
and
eye
to
make
sure
of
a
dry
passage
fourteen
spoonfuls
after
all
are
no
great
matter
though
i
wish
it
had
been
but
ten
seeing
that
the
sergeant
daughter
was
a
and
yet
you
conned
the
canoe
you
told
him
how
to
head
and
how
to
human
frailty
master
mariner
that
was
a
little
of
natur
now
had
the
sarpent
yonder
been
in
the
boat
not
a
word
would
he
have
spoken
or
thought
would
he
have
given
to
the
public
an
indian
knows
how
to
hold
his
tongue
but
we
white
folk
fancy
we
are
always
wiser
than
our
fellows
i
curing
myself
fast
of
the
weakness
but
it
needs
time
to
root
up
the
tree
that
has
been
growing
more
than
thirty
i
think
little
of
this
affair
sir
nothing
at
all
to
speak
my
mind
freely
it
a
mere
wash
of
spray
to
shooting
london
bridge
which
is
done
every
day
by
hundreds
of
persons
and
often
by
the
most
delicate
ladies
in
the
land
the
king
majesty
has
shot
the
bridge
in
his
royal
well
i
want
no
delicate
ladies
or
king
majesties
god
bless
in
the
canoe
in
going
over
these
falls
for
a
boat
breadth
either
way
may
make
a
drowning
matter
of
it
we
shall
have
to
carry
the
sergeant
brother
over
niagara
yet
to
show
him
what
may
be
done
in
a
the
devil
master
pathfinder
you
must
be
joking
now
surely
it
is
not
possible
for
a
bark
canoe
to
go
over
that
mighty
cataract
you
never
were
more
mistaken
master
cap
in
your
life
nothing
is
easier
and
many
is
the
canoe
i
have
seen
go
over
it
with
my
own
eyes
and
if
we
both
live
i
hope
to
satisfy
you
that
the
feat
can
be
done
for
my
part
i
think
the
largest
ship
that
ever
sailed
on
the
ocean
might
be
carried
over
could
she
once
get
into
the
cap
did
not
perceive
the
wink
which
pathfinder
exchanged
with
and
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
for
sooth
to
say
he
had
never
suspected
the
possibility
of
going
down
niagara
feasible
as
the
thing
must
appear
to
every
one
on
a
second
thought
the
real
difficulty
existing
in
going
up
it
by
this
time
the
party
had
reached
the
place
where
jasper
had
left
his
own
canoe
concealed
in
the
bushes
and
they
all
cap
jasper
and
his
niece
in
one
boat
and
pathfinder
arrowhead
and
the
wife
of
the
latter
in
the
other
the
mohican
had
already
passed
down
the
banks
of
the
river
by
land
looking
cautiously
and
with
the
skill
of
his
people
for
the
signs
of
an
enemy
the
cheek
of
mabel
did
not
recover
all
its
bloom
until
the
canoe
was
again
in
the
current
down
which
it
floated
swiftly
occasionally
impelled
by
the
paddle
of
jasper
she
witnessed
the
descent
of
the
falls
with
a
degree
of
terror
which
had
rendered
her
mute
but
her
fright
had
not
been
so
great
as
to
prevent
admiration
of
the
steadiness
of
the
youth
who
directed
the
movement
from
blending
with
the
passing
terror
in
truth
one
much
less
sensitive
might
have
had
her
feelings
awakened
by
the
cool
and
gallant
air
with
which
had
accomplished
this
clever
exploit
he
had
stood
firmly
erect
notwithstanding
the
plunge
and
to
those
on
the
shore
it
was
evident
that
by
a
timely
application
of
his
skill
and
strength
the
canoe
had
received
a
sheer
which
alone
carried
it
clear
of
a
rock
over
which
the
boiling
water
was
leaping
in
now
leaving
the
brown
stone
visible
and
now
covering
it
with
a
limpid
sheet
as
if
machinery
controlled
the
play
of
the
element
the
tongue
can
not
always
express
what
the
eyes
view
but
mabel
saw
enough
even
in
that
moment
of
fear
to
blend
for
ever
in
her
mind
the
pictures
presented
by
the
plunging
canoe
and
the
unmoved
steersman
she
admitted
that
insidious
feeling
which
binds
woman
so
strongly
to
man
by
feeling
additional
security
in
finding
herself
under
his
care
and
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
fort
stanwix
she
was
entirely
at
her
ease
in
the
frail
bark
in
which
she
travelled
as
the
other
canoe
kept
quite
near
her
own
however
and
the
pathfinder
by
floating
at
her
side
was
most
in
view
the
conversation
was
principally
maintained
with
that
person
jasper
seldom
speaking
unless
addressed
and
constantly
exhibiting
a
wariness
in
the
management
of
his
own
boat
which
might
have
been
remarked
by
one
accustomed
to
his
ordinarily
confident
careless
manner
we
know
too
well
a
woman
gifts
to
think
of
carrying
the
daughter
over
the
falls
said
pathfinder
looking
at
mabel
while
he
addressed
her
uncle
though
i
been
acquainted
with
some
of
her
sex
that
would
think
but
little
of
doing
the
mabel
is
like
her
mother
returned
cap
and
you
did
well
friend
to
humor
her
weakness
you
will
remember
the
child
has
never
been
at
no
no
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
by
your
own
fearlessness
any
one
might
have
seen
how
little
you
cared
about
the
matter
i
went
over
once
with
a
raw
hand
and
he
jumped
out
of
the
canoe
just
as
it
tipped
and
you
many
judge
what
a
time
he
had
of
what
became
of
the
poor
fellow
asked
cap
scarcely
knowing
how
to
take
the
other
manner
which
was
so
dry
while
it
was
so
simple
that
a
less
obtuse
subject
than
the
old
sailor
might
well
have
suspected
its
sincerity
one
who
has
passed
the
place
knows
how
to
feel
for
he
was
a
fellow
as
you
say
and
a
poor
frontierman
too
though
he
came
out
to
show
his
skill
among
us
ignoranters
what
became
of
him
why
he
went
down
the
falls
like
as
would
have
happened
to
a
or
a
if
it
should
jump
out
of
at
canoe
interrupted
jasper
smiling
though
he
was
evidently
more
disposed
than
his
friend
to
let
the
passage
of
the
falls
be
forgotten
the
boy
is
right
rejoined
pathfinder
laughing
in
mabel
face
the
canoes
being
now
so
near
that
they
almost
touched
he
is
sartainly
right
but
you
have
not
told
us
what
you
think
of
the
leap
we
took
it
was
perilous
and
bold
said
mabel
while
looking
at
it
i
could
have
wished
that
it
had
not
been
attempted
though
now
it
is
over
i
can
admire
its
boldness
and
the
steadiness
with
which
it
was
now
do
not
think
that
we
did
this
thing
to
set
ourselves
off
in
female
eyes
it
may
be
pleasant
to
the
young
to
win
each
other
good
opinions
by
doing
things
which
may
seem
praiseworthy
and
bold
but
neither
nor
myself
is
of
that
race
my
natur
has
few
turns
in
it
and
is
a
straight
natur
nor
would
it
be
likely
to
lead
me
into
a
vanity
of
this
sort
while
out
on
duty
as
for
jasper
he
would
sooner
go
over
the
oswego
falls
without
a
than
do
it
before
a
hundred
pair
of
eyes
i
know
the
lad
well
from
much
consorting
and
i
am
sure
he
is
not
boastful
or
mabel
rewarded
the
scout
with
a
smile
which
served
to
keep
the
canoes
together
for
some
time
longer
for
the
sight
of
youth
and
beauty
was
so
rare
on
that
remote
frontier
that
even
the
rebuked
and
feelings
of
this
wanderer
of
the
forest
were
sensibly
touched
by
the
blooming
loveliness
of
the
girl
we
did
it
for
the
best
pathfinder
continued
was
all
for
the
best
had
we
waited
to
carry
the
canoe
across
the
portage
time
would
have
been
lost
and
nothing
is
so
precious
as
time
when
you
are
mistrustful
of
but
we
have
little
to
fear
now
the
canoes
move
swiftly
and
two
hours
you
have
said
will
carry
us
down
to
the
it
shall
be
a
cunning
iroquois
who
hurts
a
hair
of
your
head

for
all
here
are
bound

most
i

to
yourself
to
see
you
safe
from

man
and
he
wishes
us
to
drop
in
nearer
to
his
shore
mischief
is
brewing
or
one
of
his
deliberation
and
steadiness
would
never
take
this
trouble

all
we
are
men
and
must
meet
devilry
as
becomes
our
color
and
our
callings
ah
i
never
knew
good
come
of
boasting
and
here
just
as
i
was
vaunting
of
our
safety
comes
danger
to
give

through
which
the
fragrant

did
spred
spenser
the
oswego
below
the
falls
is
a
more
rapid
unequal
stream
than
it
is
above
them
there
are
places
where
the
river
flows
in
the
quiet
stillness
of
deep
water
but
many
shoals
and
rapids
occur
and
at
that
distant
day
when
everything
was
in
its
natural
state
some
of
the
passes
were
not
altogether
without
hazard
very
little
exertion
was
required
on
the
part
of
those
who
managed
the
canoes
except
in
those
places
where
the
swiftness
of
the
current
and
the
presence
of
the
rocks
required
care
then
indeed
not
only
vigilance
but
great
coolness
readiness
and
strength
of
arm
became
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
the
dangers
of
all
this
the
mohican
was
aware
and
he
had
judiciously
selected
a
spot
where
the
river
flowed
tranquilly
to
intercept
the
canoes
in
order
to
make
his
communication
without
hazard
to
those
he
wished
to
speak
the
pathfinder
had
no
sooner
recognized
the
form
of
his
red
friend
than
with
a
strong
sweep
of
his
paddle
he
threw
the
head
of
his
own
canoe
towards
the
shore
motioning
for
jasper
to
follow
in
a
minute
both
boats
were
silently
drifting
down
the
stream
within
reach
of
the
bushes
that
overhung
the
water
all
observing
a
profound
silence
some
from
alarm
and
others
from
habitual
caution
as
the
travellers
drew
nearer
the
indian
he
made
a
sign
for
them
to
stop
and
then
he
and
pathfinder
had
a
short
but
earnest
conference
the
chief
is
not
apt
to
see
enemies
in
a
dead
log
observed
the
white
man
to
his
red
associate
why
does
he
tell
us
to
stop
mingos
are
in
the
that
we
have
believed
these
two
days
does
the
chief
know
it
the
mohican
quietly
held
up
the
head
of
a
pipe
formed
of
stone
it
lay
on
a
fresh
trail
that
led
towards
the
garrison
for
so
it
was
the
usage
of
that
frontier
to
term
a
military
work
whether
it
was
occupied
or
not
that
may
be
the
bowl
of
a
pipe
belonging
to
a
soldier
many
use
the
see
said
the
big
serpent
again
holding
the
thing
he
had
found
up
to
the
view
of
his
friend
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
was
of
and
was
carved
with
great
care
and
with
a
very
respectable
degree
of
skill
in
its
centre
was
a
small
latin
cross
made
with
an
accuracy
which
permitted
no
doubt
of
its
meaning
that
does
foretell
devilry
and
wickedness
said
the
pathfinder
who
had
all
the
provincial
horror
of
the
holy
symbol
in
question
which
then
pervaded
the
country
and
which
became
so
incorporated
with
its
prejudices
by
confounding
men
with
things
as
to
have
left
its
traces
strong
enough
on
the
moral
feeling
of
the
community
to
be
discovered
even
at
the
present
hour
no
indian
who
had
not
been
parvarted
by
the
cunning
priests
of
the
canadas
would
dream
of
carving
a
thing
like
that
on
his
pipe
i
warrant
ye
the
knave
prays
to
the
image
every
time
he
wishes
to
sarcumvent
the
innocent
and
work
his
fearful
wickedness
it
looks
fresh
too
chingachgook
the
tobacco
was
burning
when
i
found
that
is
close
work
chief
where
was
the
trail
the
mohican
pointed
to
a
spot
not
a
hundred
yards
from
that
where
they
stood
the
matter
now
began
to
look
very
serious
and
the
two
principal
guides
conferred
apart
for
several
minutes
when
both
ascended
the
bank
approached
the
indicated
spot
and
examined
the
trail
with
the
utmost
care
after
this
investigation
had
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
white
man
returned
alone
his
red
friend
having
disappeared
in
the
forest
the
ordinary
expression
of
the
countenance
of
the
pathfinder
was
that
of
simplicity
integrity
and
sincerity
blended
in
an
air
of
which
usually
gave
great
confidence
to
those
who
found
themselves
under
his
care
but
now
a
look
of
concern
cast
a
shade
over
his
honest
face
that
struck
the
whole
party
what
cheer
master
pathfinder
demanded
cap
permitting
a
voice
that
was
usually
deep
loud
and
confident
to
sink
into
the
cautious
tones
that
better
suited
the
dangers
of
the
wilderness
has
the
enemy
got
between
us
and
our
port
anan
have
any
of
these
painted
scaramouches
anchored
off
the
harbor
towards
which
we
are
running
with
the
hope
of
cutting
us
off
in
entering
it
may
be
all
as
you
say
friend
cap
but
i
am
none
the
wiser
for
your
words
and
in
ticklish
times
the
plainer
a
man
makes
his
english
the
easier
he
is
understood
i
know
nothing
of
ports
and
anchors
but
there
is
a
direful
mingo
trail
within
a
hundred
yards
of
this
very
spot
and
as
fresh
as
venison
without
salt
if
one
of
the
fiery
devils
has
passed
so
have
a
dozen
and
what
is
worse
they
have
gone
down
towards
the
garrison
and
not
a
soul
crosses
the
clearing
around
it
that
some
of
their
piercing
eyes
will
not
discover
when
sartain
bullets
will
can
not
this
said
fort
deliver
a
broadside
and
clear
everything
within
the
sweep
of
its
hawse
nay
the
forts
are
not
like
forts
in
the
settlements
and
two
or
three
light
cannon
are
all
they
have
down
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
then
broadsides
fired
at
a
dozen
outlying
mingoes
lying
behind
logs
and
in
a
forest
would
be
powder
spent
in
vain
we
have
but
one
course
and
that
is
a
very
nice
one
we
are
judgmatically
placed
here
both
canoes
being
hid
by
the
high
bank
and
the
bushes
from
all
eyes
except
those
of
any
lurker
directly
opposite
here
then
we
may
stay
without
much
present
fear
but
how
to
get
the
bloodthirsty
devils
up
the
stream
again
ha
i
have
it
i
have
it
if
it
does
no
good
it
can
do
no
harm
do
you
see
the
chestnut
here
jasper
at
the
last
turn
in
the
river
on
our
own
side
of
the
stream
i
mean
that
near
the
fallen
pine
the
very
same
take
the
flint
and
tinderbox
creep
along
the
bank
and
light
a
fire
at
that
spot
maybe
the
smoke
will
draw
them
above
us
in
the
meanwhile
we
will
drop
the
canoes
carefully
down
beyond
the
point
below
and
find
another
shelter
bushes
are
plenty
and
covers
are
easily
to
be
had
in
this
region
as
witness
the
many
i
will
do
it
pathfinder
said
jasper
springing
to
the
shore
in
ten
minutes
the
fire
shall
be
and
use
plenty
of
damp
wood
this
time
half
whispered
the
other
laughing
heartily
in
his
own
peculiar
manner
when
smoke
is
wanted
water
helps
to
thicken
the
young
man
was
soon
off
making
his
way
rapidly
towards
the
desired
point
a
slight
attempt
of
mabel
to
object
to
the
risk
was
disregarded
and
the
party
immediately
prepared
to
change
its
position
as
it
could
be
seen
from
the
place
where
jasper
intended
to
light
his
fire
the
movement
did
not
require
haste
and
it
was
made
leisurely
and
with
care
the
canoes
were
got
clear
of
the
bushes
then
suffered
to
drop
down
with
the
stream
until
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
chestnut
at
the
foot
of
which
jasper
was
to
light
the
fire
was
almost
shut
out
from
view
when
they
stopped
and
every
eye
was
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
adventurer
there
goes
the
smoke
exclaimed
the
pathfinder
as
a
current
of
air
whirled
a
little
column
of
the
vapor
from
the
land
allowing
it
to
rise
spirally
above
the
bed
of
the
river
a
good
flint
a
small
bit
of
steel
and
plenty
of
dry
leaves
makes
a
quick
fire
i
hope
will
have
the
wit
to
bethink
him
of
the
damp
wood
now
when
it
may
serve
us
all
a
good
too
much
smoke
too
much
cunning
said
arrowhead
sententiously
that
is
gospel
truth
tuscarora
if
the
mingoes
did
know
that
they
are
near
soldiers
but
soldiers
commonly
think
more
of
their
dinner
at
a
halt
than
of
their
wisdom
and
danger
no
no
let
the
boy
pile
on
his
logs
and
smoke
them
well
too
it
will
all
be
laid
to
the
stupidity
of
some
scotch
or
irish
blunderer
who
is
thinking
more
of
his
oatmeal
or
his
potatoes
than
of
indian
sarcumventions
or
indian
and
yet
i
should
think
from
all
we
have
heard
in
the
towns
that
the
soldiers
on
this
frontier
are
used
to
the
artifices
of
their
enemies
said
mabel
and
become
almost
as
wily
as
the
red
men
not
they
experience
makes
them
but
little
wiser
and
they
wheel
and
platoon
and
battalion
it
about
here
in
the
forest
just
as
they
did
in
their
parks
at
home
of
which
they
are
all
so
fond
of
talking
one
has
more
cunning
in
his
natur
than
a
whole
regiment
from
the
other
side
of
the
water
that
is
what
i
call
cunning
of
the
woods
but
there
is
smoke
enough
of
all
conscience
and
we
had
better
drop
into
another
cover
the
lad
has
thrown
the
river
on
his
fire
and
there
is
danger
that
the
mingoes
will
believe
a
whole
regiment
is
while
speaking
the
pathfinder
permitted
his
canoe
to
drift
away
from
the
bush
by
which
it
had
been
retained
and
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
bend
in
the
river
concealed
the
smoke
and
the
tree
fortunately
a
small
indentation
in
the
shore
presented
itself
within
a
few
yards
of
the
point
they
had
just
passed
and
the
two
canoes
glided
into
it
under
the
impulsion
of
the
paddles
a
better
spot
could
not
have
been
found
for
the
purpose
the
bushes
were
thick
and
overhung
the
water
forming
a
complete
canopy
of
leaves
there
was
a
small
gravelly
strand
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
bay
where
most
of
the
party
landed
to
be
more
at
their
ease
and
the
only
position
from
which
they
could
possibly
be
seen
was
a
point
on
the
river
directly
opposite
there
was
little
danger
however
of
discovery
from
that
quarter
as
the
thicket
there
was
even
denser
than
common
and
the
land
beyond
it
was
so
wet
and
marshy
as
to
render
it
difficult
to
be
trodden
this
is
a
safe
cover
said
the
pathfinder
after
he
had
taken
a
scrutinizing
survey
of
his
position
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
make
it
safer
master
cap
i
ask
nothing
of
you
but
silence
and
a
quieting
of
such
gifts
as
you
may
have
got
at
sea
while
the
tuscarora
and
i
make
provision
for
the
evil
the
guide
then
went
a
short
distance
into
the
bushes
accompanied
by
the
indian
where
the
two
cut
off
the
larger
stems
of
several
alders
and
other
bushes
using
the
utmost
care
not
to
make
a
noise
the
ends
of
these
little
trees
were
forced
into
the
mud
outside
of
the
canoes
the
depth
of
the
water
being
very
trifling
and
in
the
course
of
ten
minutes
a
very
effectual
screen
was
interposed
between
them
and
the
principal
point
of
danger
much
ingenuity
and
readiness
were
manifested
in
making
this
simple
arrangement
in
which
the
two
workmen
were
essentially
favored
by
the
natural
formation
of
the
bank
the
indentation
in
the
shore
the
shallowness
of
the
water
and
the
manner
in
which
the
tangled
bushes
dipped
into
the
stream
the
pathfinder
had
the
address
to
look
for
bushes
which
had
curved
stems
things
easily
found
in
such
a
place
and
by
cutting
them
some
distance
beneath
the
bend
and
permitting
the
latter
to
touch
the
water
the
artificial
little
thicket
had
not
the
appearance
of
growing
in
the
stream
which
might
have
excited
suspicion
but
one
passing
it
would
have
thought
that
the
bushes
shot
out
horizontally
from
the
bank
before
they
inclined
upwards
towards
the
light
in
short
none
but
an
unusually
distrustful
eye
would
have
been
turned
for
an
instant
towards
the
spot
in
quest
of
a
this
is
the
best
cover
i
ever
yet
got
into
said
the
pathfinder
with
his
quiet
laugh
after
having
been
on
the
outside
to
reconnoitre
the
leaves
of
our
new
trees
fairly
touch
those
of
the
bushes
over
our
heads
hist
yonder
comes
wading
like
a
sensible
boy
as
he
is
to
leave
his
trail
in
the
water
and
we
shall
soon
see
whether
our
cover
is
good
for
anything
or
jasper
had
indeed
returned
from
his
duty
above
and
missing
the
canoes
he
at
once
inferred
that
they
had
dropped
round
the
next
bend
in
the
river
in
order
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
fire
his
habits
of
caution
immediately
suggested
the
expediency
of
stepping
into
the
water
in
order
that
there
might
exist
no
visible
communication
between
the
marks
left
on
the
shore
by
the
party
and
the
place
where
he
believed
them
to
have
taken
refuge
below
should
the
canadian
indians
return
on
their
own
trail
and
discover
that
made
by
the
pathfinder
and
the
serpent
in
their
ascent
from
and
descent
to
the
river
the
clue
to
their
movements
would
cease
at
the
shore
water
leaving
no
prints
of
footsteps
the
young
man
had
therefore
waded
as
far
as
the
point
and
was
now
seen
making
his
way
slowly
down
the
margin
of
the
stream
searching
curiously
for
the
spot
in
which
the
canoes
were
hid
it
was
in
the
power
of
those
behind
the
bushes
by
placing
their
eyes
near
the
leaves
to
find
many
places
to
look
through
while
one
at
a
little
distance
lost
this
advantage
to
those
who
watched
his
motions
from
behind
their
cover
and
they
were
all
in
the
canoes
it
was
evident
that
jasper
was
totally
at
a
loss
to
imagine
where
the
pathfinder
had
secreted
himself
when
fairly
round
the
curvature
in
the
shore
and
out
of
sight
of
the
fire
he
had
lighted
above
the
young
man
stopped
and
began
examining
the
bank
deliberately
and
with
great
care
occasionally
he
advanced
eight
or
ten
paces
and
then
halted
again
to
renew
the
search
the
water
being
much
shallower
than
common
he
stepped
aside
in
order
to
walk
with
greater
ease
to
himself
and
came
so
near
the
artificial
plantation
that
he
might
have
touched
it
with
his
hand
still
he
detected
nothing
and
was
actually
passing
the
spot
when
pathfinder
made
an
opening
beneath
the
branches
and
called
to
him
in
a
low
voice
to
enter
this
is
pretty
well
said
the
pathfinder
laughing
though
eyes
and
eyes
are
as
different
as
human
i
would
wager
with
the
sergeant
daughter
here
a
horn
of
powder
against
a
for
her
girdle
that
her
father
rijiment
should
march
by
this
embankment
of
ours
and
never
find
out
the
fraud
but
if
the
mingoes
actually
get
down
into
the
bed
of
the
river
where
jasper
passed
i
should
tremble
for
the
plantation
it
will
do
for
their
eyes
even
across
the
stream
however
and
will
not
be
without
its
do
you
think
master
pathfinder
that
it
would
be
wisest
after
all
said
cap
to
get
under
way
at
once
and
carry
sail
hard
down
stream
as
soon
as
we
are
satisfied
that
these
rascals
are
fairly
astern
of
us
we
seamen
call
a
stern
chase
a
long
i
would
move
from
this
spot
until
we
hear
from
the
sarpent
with
the
sergeant
pretty
daughter
here
in
our
company
for
all
the
powder
in
the
magazine
of
the
fort
below
sartain
captivity
or
sartain
death
would
follow
if
a
tender
such
as
the
maiden
we
have
in
charge
could
thread
the
forest
like
old
deer
it
might
indeed
do
to
quit
the
canoes
for
by
making
a
circuit
we
could
reach
the
garrison
before
then
let
it
be
done
said
mabel
springing
to
her
feet
under
the
sudden
impulse
of
awakened
energy
i
am
young
active
used
to
exercise
and
could
easily
my
dear
uncle
let
no
one
think
me
a
hindrance
i
can
not
bear
that
all
your
lives
should
be
exposed
on
my
no
no
pretty
one
we
think
you
anything
but
a
hindrance
or
anything
that
is
unbecoming
and
would
willingly
run
twice
this
risk
to
do
you
and
the
honest
sergeant
a
service
do
i
not
speak
your
mind
to
do
a
service
said
jasper
with
emphasis
nothing
shall
tempt
me
to
desert
mabel
dunham
until
she
is
safe
in
her
father
well
said
lad
bravely
and
honestly
said
too
and
i
join
in
it
heart
and
hand
no
no
you
are
not
the
first
of
your
sex
i
have
led
through
the
wilderness
and
never
but
once
did
any
harm
befall
any
of
them
that
was
a
sad
day
certainly
but
its
like
may
never
come
mabel
looked
from
one
of
her
protectors
to
the
other
and
her
fine
eyes
swam
in
tears
frankly
placing
a
hand
in
that
of
each
she
answered
them
though
at
first
her
voice
was
choked
i
have
no
right
to
expose
you
on
my
account
my
dear
father
will
thank
you
i
thank
you
god
will
reward
you
but
let
there
be
no
unnecessary
risk
i
can
walk
far
and
have
often
gone
miles
on
some
girlish
fancy
why
not
now
exert
myself
for
my
life
nay
for
your
precious
lives
she
is
a
true
dove
jasper
said
the
pathfinder
neither
relinquishing
the
hand
he
held
until
the
girl
herself
in
native
modesty
saw
fit
to
withdraw
it
and
wonderfully
winning
we
get
to
be
rough
and
sometimes
even
in
the
woods
mabel
but
the
sight
of
one
like
you
brings
us
back
again
to
our
young
feelings
and
does
us
good
for
the
remainder
of
our
days
i
daresay
jasper
here
will
tell
you
the
same
for
like
me
in
the
forest
the
lad
sees
but
few
such
as
yourself
on
ontario
to
soften
his
heart
and
remind
him
of
love
for
his
kind
speak
out
now
jasper
and
say
if
it
is
not
so
i
question
if
many
like
mabel
dunham
are
to
be
found
anywhere
returned
the
young
man
gallantly
an
honest
sincerity
glowing
in
his
face
that
spoke
more
eloquently
than
his
tongue
you
need
not
mention
the
woods
and
lakes
to
challenge
her
equals
but
i
would
go
into
settlements
and
we
had
better
leave
the
canoes
mabel
hurriedly
rejoined
for
i
feel
it
is
no
longer
safe
to
be
you
can
never
do
it
you
can
never
do
it
it
would
be
a
march
of
more
than
twenty
miles
and
that
too
of
tramping
over
brush
and
roots
and
through
swamps
in
the
dark
the
trail
of
such
a
party
would
be
wide
and
we
might
have
to
fight
our
way
into
the
garrison
after
all
we
will
wait
for
the
such
appearing
to
be
the
decision
of
him
to
whom
all
in
their
present
strait
looked
up
for
counsel
no
more
was
said
on
the
subject
the
whole
party
now
broke
up
into
groups
arrowhead
and
his
wife
sitting
apart
under
the
bushes
conversing
in
a
low
tone
though
the
man
spoke
sternly
and
the
woman
answered
with
the
subdued
mildness
that
marks
the
degraded
condition
of
a
savage

pathfinder
and
cap
occupied
one
canoe
chatting
of
their
different
adventures
by
sea
and
land
while
jasper
and
mabel
sat
in
the
other
making
greater
progress
in
intimacy
in
a
single
hour
than
might
have
been
effected
under
other
circumstances
in
a
twelvemonth
notwithstanding
their
situation
as
regards
the
enemy
the
time
flew
by
swiftly
and
the
young
people
in
particular
were
astonished
when
cap
informed
them
how
long
they
had
been
thus
occupied
if
one
could
smoke
master
pathfinder
observed
the
old
sailor
this
berth
would
be
snug
enough
for
to
give
the
devil
his
due
you
have
got
the
canoes
handsomely
landlocked
and
into
moorings
that
would
defy
a
monsoon
the
only
hardship
is
the
denial
of
the
the
scent
of
the
tobacco
would
betray
us
and
where
is
the
use
of
taking
all
these
precautions
against
the
mingo
eyes
if
we
are
to
tell
him
where
the
cover
is
to
be
found
through
the
nose
no
no
deny
your
appetites
and
learn
one
virtue
from
a
who
will
pass
a
week
without
eating
even
to
get
a
single
scalp
did
you
hear
nothing
jasper
the
serpent
is
then
let
us
see
if
mohican
eyes
are
better
than
them
of
a
lad
who
follows
the
the
mohican
had
indeed
made
his
appearance
in
the
same
direction
as
that
by
which
jasper
had
rejoined
his
friends
instead
of
coming
directly
on
however
no
sooner
did
he
pass
the
bend
where
he
was
concealed
from
any
who
might
be
higher
up
stream
than
he
moved
close
under
the
bank
and
using
the
utmost
caution
got
a
position
where
he
could
look
back
with
his
person
sufficiently
concealed
by
the
bushes
to
prevent
its
being
seen
by
any
in
that
quarter
the
sarpent
sees
the
knaves
whispered
pathfinder
as
i
a
christian
white
man
they
have
bit
at
the
bait
and
have
ambushed
the
smoke
here
a
hearty
but
silent
laugh
interrupted
his
words
and
nudging
cap
with
his
elbow
they
all
continued
to
watch
the
movements
of
chingachgook
in
profound
stillness
the
mohican
remained
stationary
as
the
rock
on
which
he
stood
full
ten
minutes
and
then
it
was
apparent
that
something
of
interest
had
occurred
within
his
view
for
he
drew
back
with
a
hurried
manner
looked
anxiously
and
keenly
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
and
moved
quickly
down
it
taking
care
to
lose
his
trail
in
the
shallow
water
he
was
evidently
in
a
hurry
and
concerned
now
looking
behind
him
and
then
casting
eager
glances
towards
every
spot
on
the
shore
where
he
thought
a
canoe
might
be
concealed
call
him
in
whispered
jasper
scarcely
able
to
restrain
his
impatience
call
him
in
or
it
will
be
too
late
see
he
is
actually
passing
not
so
not
so
lad
nothing
presses
depend
on
it
returned
his
companion
or
the
sarpent
would
begin
to
creep
the
lord
help
us
and
teach
us
wisdom
i
believe
even
chingachgook
whose
sight
is
as
faithful
as
the
hound
scent
overlooks
us
and
will
not
find
out
the
ambushment
we
have
made
this
exultation
was
untimely
for
the
words
were
no
sooner
spoken
than
the
indian
who
had
actually
got
several
feet
lower
down
the
stream
than
the
artificial
cover
suddenly
stopped
fastened
a
glance
among
the
transplanted
bushes
made
a
few
hasty
steps
backward
and
bending
his
body
and
carefully
separating
the
branches
he
appeared
among
them
the
accursed
mingos
said
pathfinder
as
soon
as
his
friend
was
near
enough
to
be
addressed
with
prudence
iroquois
returned
the
sententious
indian
no
matter
no
matter
iroquois
devil
mingo
mengwes
or
furies
all
are
pretty
much
the
same
i
call
all
rascals
mingos
come
hither
chief
and
let
us
convarse
when
their
private
communication
was
over
pathfinder
rejoined
the
rest
and
made
them
acquainted
with
all
he
had
learned
the
mohican
had
followed
the
trail
of
their
enemies
some
distance
towards
the
fort
until
the
latter
caught
a
sight
of
the
smoke
of
jasper
fire
when
they
instantly
retraced
their
steps
it
now
became
necessary
for
chingachgook
who
ran
the
greatest
risk
of
detection
to
find
a
cover
where
he
could
secrete
himself
until
the
party
might
pass
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
him
that
the
savages
were
so
intent
on
this
recent
discovery
that
they
did
not
bestow
the
ordinary
attention
on
the
signs
of
the
forest
at
all
events
they
passed
him
swiftly
fifteen
in
number
treading
lightly
in
each
other
footsteps
and
he
was
enabled
again
to
get
into
their
rear
after
proceeding
to
the
place
where
the
footsteps
of
pathfinder
and
the
mohican
had
joined
the
principal
trail
the
iroquois
had
struck
off
to
the
river
which
they
reached
just
as
jasper
had
disappeared
behind
the
bend
below
the
smoke
being
now
in
plain
view
the
savages
plunged
into
the
woods
and
endeavored
to
approach
the
fire
unseen
chingachgook
profited
by
this
occasion
to
descend
to
the
water
and
to
gain
the
bend
in
the
river
also
which
he
thought
had
been
effected
undiscovered
here
he
paused
as
has
been
stated
until
he
saw
his
enemies
at
the
fire
where
their
stay
however
was
very
short
of
the
motives
of
the
iroquois
the
mohican
could
judge
only
by
their
acts
he
thought
they
had
detected
the
artifice
of
the
fire
and
were
aware
that
it
had
been
kindled
with
a
view
to
mislead
them
for
after
a
hasty
examination
of
the
spot
they
had
separated
some
plunging
again
into
the
woods
while
six
or
eight
had
followed
the
footsteps
of
jasper
along
the
shore
and
come
down
the
stream
towards
the
place
where
the
canoes
had
landed
what
course
they
might
take
on
reaching
that
spot
was
only
to
be
conjectured
for
the
serpent
had
felt
the
emergency
to
be
too
pressing
to
delay
looking
for
his
friends
any
longer
from
some
indications
that
were
to
be
gathered
from
their
gestures
however
he
thought
it
probable
that
their
enemies
might
follow
down
in
the
margin
of
the
stream
but
could
not
be
certain
as
the
pathfinder
related
these
facts
to
his
companions
the
professional
feelings
of
the
two
other
white
men
came
uppermost
and
both
naturally
reverted
to
their
habits
in
quest
of
the
means
of
escape
let
us
run
out
the
canoes
at
once
said
jasper
eagerly
the
current
is
strong
and
by
using
the
paddles
vigorously
we
shall
soon
be
beyond
the
reach
of
these
scoundrels
and
this
poor
flower
that
first
blossomed
in
the
clearings
shall
it
wither
in
the
forest
objected
his
friend
with
a
poetry
which
he
had
unconsciously
imbibed
by
his
long
association
with
the
delawares
we
must
all
die
first
answered
the
youth
a
generous
color
mounting
to
his
temples
mabel
and
arrowhead
wife
may
lie
down
in
the
canoes
while
we
do
our
duty
like
men
on
our
ay
you
are
active
at
the
paddle
and
the
oar
i
will
allow
but
an
accursed
mingo
is
more
active
at
his
mischief
the
canoes
are
swift
but
a
rifle

it
is
the
business
of
men
engaged
as
we
have
been
by
a
confiding
father
to
run
this
risk
but
it
is
not
their
business
to
overlook
prudence
a
man
may
carry
his
prudence
so
far
as
to
forget
his
the
group
was
standing
on
the
narrow
strand
the
pathfinder
leaning
on
his
rifle
the
butt
of
which
rested
on
the
gravelly
beach
while
both
his
hands
clasped
the
barrel
at
the
height
of
his
own
shoulders
as
jasper
threw
out
this
severe
and
unmerited
imputation
the
deep
red
of
his
comrade
face
maintained
its
hue
unchanged
though
the
young
man
perceived
that
the
fingers
grasped
the
iron
of
the
gun
with
the
tenacity
of
a
vice
here
all
betrayal
of
emotion
ceased
you
are
young
and
returned
pathfinder
with
a
dignity
that
impressed
his
listeners
with
a
keen
sense
of
his
moral
superiority
but
my
life
has
been
passed
among
dangers
of
this
sort
and
my
experience
and
gifts
are
not
to
be
mastered
by
the
impatience
of
a
boy
as
for
courage
jasper
i
will
not
send
back
an
angry
and
unmeaning
word
to
meet
an
angry
and
an
unmeaning
word
for
i
know
that
you
are
true
in
your
station
and
according
to
your
knowledge
but
take
the
advice
of
one
who
faced
the
mingos
when
you
were
a
child
and
know
that
their
cunning
is
easier
sarcumvented
by
prudence
than
outwitted
by
i
ask
your
pardon
pathfinder
said
the
repentant
jasper
eagerly
grasping
the
hand
that
the
other
permitted
him
to
seize
i
ask
your
pardon
humbly
and
sincerely
was
a
foolish
as
well
as
wicked
thing
to
hint
of
a
man
whose
heart
in
a
good
cause
is
known
to
be
as
firm
as
the
rocks
on
the
lake
for
the
first
time
the
color
deepened
on
the
cheek
of
the
pathfinder
and
the
solemn
dignity
which
he
had
assumed
under
a
purely
natural
impulse
disappeared
in
the
expression
of
the
earnest
simplicity
inherent
in
all
his
feelings
he
met
the
grasp
of
his
young
friend
with
a
squeeze
as
cordial
as
if
no
chord
had
jarred
between
them
and
a
slight
sternness
that
had
gathered
about
his
eye
disappeared
in
a
look
of
natural
kindness
is
well
jasper
he
answered
laughing
i
bear
no
nor
shall
any
one
on
my
behalf
my
natur
is
that
of
a
white
man
and
that
is
to
bear
no
malice
it
might
have
been
ticklish
work
to
have
said
half
as
much
to
the
sarpent
here
though
he
is
a
delaware
for
color
will
have
its
way
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
caused
the
speaker
to
cease
mabel
was
standing
erect
in
the
canoe
her
light
but
swelling
form
bent
forward
in
an
attitude
of
graceful
earnestness
her
finger
on
her
lips
her
head
averted
her
spirited
eyes
riveted
on
an
opening
in
the
bushes
and
one
arm
extended
with
a
the
end
of
which
had
touched
the
pathfinder
the
latter
bowed
his
head
to
a
level
with
a
near
which
he
had
intentionally
kept
himself
and
then
whispered
to
jasper
the
accursed
mingos
stand
to
your
arms
my
men
but
lay
quiet
as
the
corpses
of
dead
trees
jasper
advanced
rapidly
but
noiselessly
to
the
canoe
and
with
a
gentle
violence
induced
mabel
to
place
herself
in
such
an
attitude
as
concealed
her
entire
body
though
it
would
have
probably
exceeded
his
means
to
induce
the
girl
so
far
to
lower
her
head
that
she
could
not
keep
her
gaze
fastened
on
their
enemies
he
then
took
his
own
post
near
her
with
his
rifle
cocked
and
poised
in
readiness
to
fire
arrowhead
and
chingachgook
crawled
to
the
cover
and
lay
in
wait
like
snakes
with
their
arms
prepared
for
service
while
the
wife
of
the
former
bowed
her
head
between
her
knees
covered
it
with
her
calico
robe
and
remained
passive
and
immovable
cap
loosened
both
his
pistols
in
their
belt
but
seemed
quite
at
a
loss
what
course
to
pursue
the
pathfinder
did
not
stir
he
had
originally
got
a
position
where
he
might
aim
with
deadly
effect
through
the
leaves
and
where
he
could
watch
the
movements
of
his
enemies
and
he
was
far
too
steady
to
be
disconcerted
at
a
moment
so
critical
it
was
truly
an
alarming
instant
just
as
mabel
touched
the
shoulder
of
her
guide
three
of
the
iroquois
had
appeared
in
the
water
at
the
bend
of
the
river
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
cover
and
halted
to
examine
the
stream
below
they
were
all
naked
to
the
waist
armed
for
an
expedition
against
their
foes
and
in
their
warpaint
it
was
apparent
that
they
were
undecided
as
to
the
course
they
ought
to
pursue
in
order
to
find
the
fugitives
one
pointed
down
the
river
a
second
up
the
stream
and
the
third
towards
the
opposite
bank
they
evidently
doubted
chapter
v
death
is
here
and
death
is
there
death
is
busy
everywhere
shelley
it
was
a
breathless
moment
the
only
clue
the
fugitives
possessed
to
the
intentions
of
their
pursuers
was
in
their
gestures
and
the
indications
which
escaped
them
in
the
fury
of
disappointment
that
a
party
had
returned
already
on
their
own
footsteps
by
land
was
pretty
certain
and
all
the
benefit
expected
from
the
artifice
of
the
fire
was
necessarily
lost
but
that
consideration
became
of
little
moment
just
then
for
the
party
was
menaced
with
an
immediate
discovery
by
those
who
had
kept
on
a
level
with
the
river
all
the
facts
presented
themselves
clearly
and
as
it
might
be
by
intuition
to
the
mind
of
pathfinder
who
perceived
the
necessity
of
immediate
decision
and
of
being
in
readiness
to
act
in
concert
without
making
any
noise
therefore
he
managed
to
get
the
two
indians
and
jasper
near
him
when
he
opened
his
communications
in
a
whisper
we
must
be
ready
we
must
be
ready
he
said
there
are
but
three
of
the
scalping
devils
and
we
are
five
four
of
whom
may
be
set
down
as
manful
warriors
for
such
a
skrimmage
do
you
take
the
fellow
that
is
painted
like
death
chingachgook
i
give
you
the
chief
and
arrowhead
must
keep
his
eye
on
the
young
one
there
must
be
no
mistake
for
two
bullets
in
the
same
body
would
be
sinful
waste
with
one
like
the
sergeant
daughter
in
danger
i
shall
hold
myself
in
resarve
against
accident
lest
a
fourth
reptile
appear
for
one
of
your
hands
may
prove
unsteady
by
no
means
fire
until
i
give
the
word
we
must
not
let
the
crack
of
the
rifle
be
heard
except
in
the
last
resort
since
all
the
rest
of
the
miscreants
are
still
within
hearing
jasper
boy
in
case
of
any
movement
behind
us
on
the
bank
i
trust
to
you
to
run
out
the
canoe
with
the
sergeant
daughter
and
to
pull
for
the
garrison
by
god
the
pathfinder
had
no
sooner
given
these
directions
than
the
near
approach
of
their
enemies
rendered
profound
silence
necessary
the
iroquois
in
the
river
were
slowly
descending
the
stream
keeping
of
necessity
near
the
bushes
which
overhung
the
water
while
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
the
snapping
of
twigs
soon
gave
fearful
evidence
that
another
party
was
moving
along
the
bank
at
an
equally
graduated
pace
and
directly
abreast
of
them
in
consequence
of
the
distance
between
the
bushes
planted
by
the
fugitives
and
the
true
shore
the
two
parties
became
visible
to
each
other
when
opposite
that
precise
point
both
stopped
and
a
conversation
ensued
that
may
be
said
to
have
passed
directly
over
the
heads
of
those
who
were
concealed
indeed
nothing
sheltered
the
travellers
but
the
branches
and
leaves
of
plants
so
pliant
that
they
yielded
to
every
current
of
air
and
which
a
puff
of
wind
a
little
stronger
than
common
would
have
blown
away
fortunately
the
line
of
sight
carried
the
eyes
of
the
two
parties
of
savages
whether
they
stood
in
the
water
or
on
the
land
above
the
bushes
and
the
leaves
appeared
blended
in
a
way
to
excite
no
suspicion
perhaps
the
very
boldness
of
the
expedient
alone
prevented
an
immediate
exposure
the
conversation
which
took
place
was
conducted
earnestly
but
in
guarded
tones
as
if
those
who
spoke
wished
to
defeat
the
intentions
of
any
listeners
it
was
in
a
dialect
that
both
the
indian
warriors
beneath
as
well
as
the
pathfinder
understood
even
jasper
comprehended
a
portion
of
what
was
said
the
trail
is
washed
away
by
the
water
said
one
from
below
who
stood
so
near
the
artificial
cover
of
the
fugitives
that
he
might
have
been
struck
by
the
that
lay
in
the
bottom
of
jasper
canoe
water
has
washed
it
so
clear
that
a
yengeese
hound
could
not
the
have
left
the
shore
in
their
canoes
answered
the
speaker
on
the
bank
it
can
not
be
the
rifles
of
our
warriors
below
are
the
pathfinder
gave
a
significant
glance
at
jasper
and
he
clinched
his
teeth
in
order
to
suppress
the
sound
of
his
own
breathing
let
my
young
men
look
as
if
their
eyes
were
eagles
said
the
eldest
warrior
among
those
who
were
wading
in
the
river
we
have
been
a
whole
moon
on
the
and
have
found
but
one
scalp
there
is
a
maiden
among
them
and
some
of
our
braves
want
happily
these
words
were
lost
on
mabel
but
jasper
frown
became
deeper
and
his
face
fiercely
flushed
the
savages
now
ceased
speaking
and
the
party
which
was
concealed
heard
the
slow
and
guarded
movements
of
those
who
were
on
the
bank
as
they
pushed
the
bushes
aside
in
their
wary
progress
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
latter
had
passed
the
cover
but
the
group
in
the
water
still
remained
scanning
the
shore
with
eyes
that
glared
through
their
like
coals
of
living
fire
after
a
pause
of
two
or
three
minutes
these
three
began
also
to
descend
the
stream
though
it
was
step
by
step
as
men
move
who
look
for
an
object
that
has
been
lost
in
this
manner
they
passed
the
artificial
screen
and
pathfinder
opened
his
mouth
in
that
hearty
but
noiseless
laugh
that
nature
and
habit
had
contributed
to
render
a
peculiarity
of
the
man
his
triumph
however
was
premature
for
the
last
of
the
retiring
party
just
at
this
moment
casting
a
look
behind
him
suddenly
stopped
and
his
fixed
attitude
and
steady
gaze
at
once
betrayed
the
appalling
fact
that
some
neglected
bush
had
awakened
his
suspicions
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
the
concealed
that
the
warrior
who
manifested
these
fearful
signs
of
distrust
was
young
and
had
still
a
reputation
to
acquire
he
knew
the
importance
of
discretion
and
modesty
in
one
of
his
years
and
most
of
all
did
he
dread
the
ridicule
and
contempt
that
would
certainly
follow
a
false
alarm
without
recalling
any
of
his
companions
therefore
he
turned
on
his
own
footsteps
and
while
the
others
continued
to
descend
the
river
he
cautiously
approached
the
bushes
on
which
his
looks
were
still
fastened
as
by
a
charm
some
of
the
leaves
which
were
exposed
to
the
sun
had
drooped
a
little
and
this
slight
departure
from
the
usual
natural
laws
had
caught
the
quick
eyes
of
the
indian
for
so
practised
and
acute
do
the
senses
of
the
savage
become
more
especially
when
he
is
on
the
that
trifles
apparently
of
the
most
insignificant
sort
often
prove
to
be
clues
to
lead
him
to
his
object
the
trifling
nature
of
the
change
which
had
aroused
the
suspicion
of
this
youth
was
an
additional
motive
for
not
acquainting
his
companions
with
his
discovery
should
he
really
detect
anything
his
glory
would
be
the
greater
for
being
unshared
and
should
he
not
he
might
hope
to
escape
that
derision
which
the
young
indian
so
much
dreads
then
there
were
the
dangers
of
an
ambush
and
a
surprise
to
which
every
warrior
of
the
woods
is
keenly
alive
to
render
his
approach
slow
and
cautious
in
consequence
of
the
delay
that
proceeded
from
these
combined
causes
the
two
parties
had
descended
some
fifty
or
sixty
yards
before
the
young
savage
was
again
near
enough
to
the
bushes
of
the
pathfinder
to
touch
them
with
his
hand
notwithstanding
their
critical
situation
the
whole
party
behind
the
cover
had
their
eyes
fastened
on
the
working
countenance
of
the
young
iroquois
who
was
agitated
by
conflicting
feelings
first
came
the
eager
hope
of
obtaining
success
where
some
of
the
most
experienced
of
his
tribe
had
failed
and
with
it
a
degree
of
glory
that
had
seldom
fallen
to
the
share
of
one
of
his
years
or
a
brave
on
his
first
then
followed
doubts
as
the
drooping
leaves
seemed
to
rise
again
and
to
revive
in
the
currents
of
air
and
distrust
of
hidden
danger
lent
its
exciting
feeling
to
keep
the
eloquent
features
in
play
so
very
slight
however
had
been
the
alteration
produced
by
the
heat
on
the
bushes
of
which
the
stems
were
in
the
water
that
when
the
iroquois
actually
laid
his
hand
on
the
leaves
he
fancied
that
he
had
been
deceived
as
no
man
ever
distrusts
strongly
without
using
all
convenient
means
of
satisfying
his
doubts
however
the
young
warrior
cautiously
pushed
aside
the
branches
and
advanced
a
step
within
the
when
the
forms
of
the
concealed
party
met
his
gaze
resembling
so
many
breathless
statues
the
low
exclamation
the
slight
start
and
the
glaring
eye
were
hardly
seen
and
heard
before
the
arm
of
chingachgook
was
raised
and
the
tomahawk
of
the
delaware
descended
on
the
shaven
head
of
his
foe
the
iroquois
raised
his
hands
frantically
bounded
backward
and
fell
into
the
water
at
a
spot
where
the
current
swept
the
body
away
the
struggling
limbs
still
tossing
and
writhing
in
the
agony
of
death
the
delaware
made
a
vigorous
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
seize
an
arm
with
the
hope
of
securing
the
scalp
but
the
bloodstained
waters
whirled
down
the
current
carrying
with
them
their
quivering
burden
all
this
passed
in
less
than
a
minute
and
the
events
were
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
men
less
accustomed
than
the
pathfinder
and
his
associates
to
forest
warfare
would
have
been
at
a
loss
how
to
act
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
said
jasper
tearing
aside
the
bushes
as
he
spoke
earnestly
but
in
a
suppressed
voice
do
as
i
do
master
cap
if
you
would
save
your
niece
and
you
mabel
lie
at
your
length
in
the
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
seizing
the
bow
of
the
light
boat
he
dragged
it
along
the
shore
wading
himself
while
cap
aided
behind
keeping
so
near
the
bank
as
to
avoid
being
seen
by
the
savages
below
and
striving
to
gain
the
turn
in
the
river
above
him
which
would
effectually
conceal
the
party
from
the
enemy
the
pathfinder
canoe
lay
nearest
to
the
bank
and
was
necessarily
the
last
to
quit
the
shore
the
delaware
leaped
on
the
narrow
strand
and
plunged
into
the
forest
it
being
his
assigned
duty
to
watch
the
foe
in
that
quarter
while
arrowhead
motioned
to
his
white
companion
to
seize
the
bow
of
the
boat
and
to
follow
jasper
all
this
was
the
work
of
an
instant
but
when
the
pathfinder
reached
the
current
that
was
sweeping
round
the
turn
he
felt
a
sudden
change
in
the
weight
he
was
dragging
and
looking
back
he
found
that
both
the
tuscarora
and
his
wife
had
deserted
him
the
thought
of
treachery
flashed
upon
his
mind
but
there
was
no
time
to
pause
for
the
wailing
shout
that
arose
from
the
party
below
proclaimed
that
the
body
of
the
young
iroquois
had
floated
as
low
as
the
spot
reached
by
his
friends
the
report
of
a
rifle
followed
and
then
the
guide
saw
that
jasper
having
doubled
the
bend
in
the
river
was
crossing
the
stream
standing
erect
in
the
stern
of
the
canoe
while
cap
was
seated
forward
both
propelling
the
light
boat
with
vigorous
strokes
of
the
paddles
a
glance
a
thought
and
an
expedient
followed
each
other
quickly
in
one
so
trained
in
the
vicissitudes
of
the
frontier
warfare
springing
into
the
stern
of
his
own
canoe
he
urged
it
by
a
vigorous
shove
into
the
current
and
commenced
crossing
the
stream
himself
at
a
point
so
much
lower
than
that
of
his
companions
as
to
offer
his
own
person
for
a
target
to
the
enemy
well
knowing
that
their
keen
desire
to
secure
a
scalp
would
control
all
other
feelings
keep
well
up
the
current
jasper
shouted
the
gallant
guide
as
he
swept
the
water
with
long
steady
vigorous
strokes
of
the
paddle
keep
well
up
the
current
and
pull
for
the
alder
bushes
opposite
presarve
the
sergeant
daughter
before
all
things
and
leave
these
mingo
knaves
to
the
sarpent
and
jasper
flourished
his
paddle
as
a
signal
of
understanding
while
shot
succeeded
shot
in
quick
succession
all
now
being
aimed
at
the
solitary
man
in
the
nearest
canoe
ay
empty
your
rifles
like
simpletons
as
you
are
said
the
pathfinder
who
had
acquired
a
habit
of
speaking
when
alone
from
passing
so
much
of
his
time
in
the
solitude
of
the
forest
empty
your
rifles
with
an
unsteady
aim
and
give
me
time
to
put
yard
upon
yard
of
river
between
us
i
will
not
revile
you
like
a
delaware
or
a
mohican
for
my
gifts
are
a
white
man
gifts
and
not
an
indian
and
boasting
in
battle
is
no
part
of
a
christian
warrior
but
i
may
say
here
all
alone
by
myself
that
you
are
little
better
than
so
many
men
from
the
town
shooting
at
robins
in
the
orchards
that
was
well
meant
throwing
back
his
head
as
a
rifle
bullet
cut
a
lock
of
hair
from
his
temple
but
the
lead
that
misses
by
an
inch
is
as
useless
as
the
lead
that
never
quits
the
barrel
bravely
done
jasper
the
sergeant
sweet
child
must
be
saved
even
if
we
go
in
without
our
own
by
this
time
the
pathfinder
was
in
the
centre
of
the
river
and
almost
abreast
of
his
enemies
while
the
other
canoe
impelled
by
the
vigorous
arms
of
cap
and
jasper
had
nearly
gained
the
opposite
shore
at
the
precise
spot
that
had
been
pointed
out
to
them
the
old
mariner
now
played
his
part
manfully
for
he
was
on
his
proper
element
loved
his
niece
sincerely
had
a
proper
regard
for
his
own
person
and
was
not
unused
to
fire
though
his
experience
certainly
lay
in
a
very
different
species
of
warfare
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddles
were
given
and
the
canoe
shot
into
the
bushes
mabel
was
hurried
to
land
by
jasper
and
for
the
present
all
three
of
the
fugitives
were
safe
not
so
with
the
pathfinder
his
hardy
had
brought
him
into
a
situation
of
unusual
exposure
the
hazards
of
which
were
much
increased
by
the
fact
that
just
as
he
drifted
nearest
to
the
enemy
the
party
on
the
shore
rushed
down
the
bank
and
joined
their
friends
who
still
stood
in
the
water
the
oswego
was
about
a
cable
length
in
width
at
this
point
and
the
canoe
being
in
the
centre
the
object
was
only
a
hundred
yards
from
the
rifles
that
were
constantly
discharged
at
it
or
at
the
usual
target
distance
for
that
weapon
in
this
extremity
the
steadiness
and
skill
of
the
pathfinder
did
him
good
service
he
knew
that
his
safety
depended
altogether
on
keeping
in
motion
for
a
stationary
object
at
that
distance
would
have
been
hit
nearly
every
shot
nor
was
motion
of
itself
sufficient
for
accustomed
to
kill
the
bounding
deer
his
enemies
probably
knew
how
to
vary
the
line
of
aim
so
as
to
strike
him
should
he
continue
to
move
in
any
one
direction
he
was
consequently
compelled
to
change
the
course
of
the
canoe
at
one
moment
shooting
down
with
the
current
with
the
swiftness
of
an
arrow
and
at
the
next
checking
its
progress
in
that
direction
to
glance
athwart
the
stream
luckily
the
iroquois
could
not
reload
their
pieces
in
the
water
and
the
bushes
that
everywhere
fringed
the
shore
rendered
it
difficult
to
keep
the
fugitive
in
view
when
on
the
land
aided
by
these
circumstances
and
having
received
the
fire
of
all
his
foes
the
pathfinder
was
gaining
fast
in
distance
both
downwards
and
across
the
current
when
a
new
danger
suddenly
if
not
unexpectedly
presented
itself
by
the
appearance
of
the
party
that
had
been
left
in
ambush
below
with
a
view
to
watch
the
river
these
were
the
savages
alluded
to
in
the
short
dialogue
already
related
they
were
no
less
than
ten
in
number
and
understanding
all
the
advantages
of
their
bloody
occupation
they
had
posted
themselves
at
a
spot
where
the
water
dashed
among
rocks
and
over
shallows
in
a
way
to
form
a
rapid
which
in
the
language
of
the
country
is
called
a
rift
the
pathfinder
saw
that
if
he
entered
this
rift
he
should
be
compelled
to
approach
a
point
where
the
iroquois
had
posted
themselves
for
the
current
was
irresistible
and
the
rocks
allowed
no
other
safe
passage
while
death
or
captivity
would
be
the
probable
result
of
the
attempt
all
his
efforts
therefore
were
turned
toward
reaching
the
western
shore
the
foe
being
all
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
but
the
exploit
surpassed
human
power
and
to
attempt
to
stem
the
stream
would
at
once
have
so
far
diminished
the
motion
of
the
canoe
as
to
render
aim
certain
in
this
exigency
the
guide
came
to
a
decision
with
his
usual
cool
promptitude
making
his
preparations
accordingly
instead
of
endeavoring
to
gain
the
channel
he
steered
towards
the
shallowest
part
of
the
stream
on
reaching
which
he
seized
his
rifle
and
pack
leaped
into
the
water
and
began
to
wade
from
rock
to
rock
taking
the
direction
of
the
western
shore
the
canoe
whirled
about
in
the
furious
current
now
rolling
over
some
slippery
stone
now
filling
and
then
emptying
itself
until
it
lodged
on
the
shore
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
where
the
iroquois
had
posted
themselves
in
the
meanwhile
the
pathfinder
was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
for
the
first
minute
admiration
of
his
promptitude
and
daring
which
are
so
high
virtues
in
the
mind
of
an
indian
kept
his
enemies
motionless
but
the
desire
of
revenge
and
the
cravings
for
the
trophy
soon
overcame
this
transient
feeling
and
aroused
them
from
their
stupor
rifle
flashed
after
rifle
and
the
bullets
whistled
around
the
head
of
the
fugitive
amid
the
roar
of
the
waters
still
he
proceeded
like
one
who
bore
a
charmed
life
for
while
his
rude
frontier
garments
were
more
than
once
cut
his
skin
was
not
razed
as
the
pathfinder
in
several
instances
was
compelled
to
wade
in
water
which
rose
nearly
to
his
arms
while
he
kept
his
rifle
and
ammunition
elevated
above
the
raging
current
the
toil
soon
fatigued
him
and
he
was
glad
to
stop
at
a
large
stone
or
a
small
rock
which
rose
so
high
above
the
river
that
its
upper
surface
was
dry
on
this
stone
he
placed
his
getting
behind
it
himself
so
as
to
have
the
advantage
of
a
partial
cover
for
his
body
the
western
shore
was
only
fifty
feet
distant
but
the
quiet
swift
dark
current
that
glanced
through
the
interval
sufficiently
showed
that
here
he
would
be
compelled
to
swim
a
short
cessation
in
the
firing
now
took
place
on
the
part
of
the
indians
who
gathered
about
the
canoe
and
having
found
the
paddles
were
preparing
to
cross
the
river
pathfinder
called
a
voice
from
among
the
bushes
at
the
point
nearest
to
the
person
addressed
on
the
western
shore
what
would
you
have
jasper
be
of
good
heart
friends
are
at
hand
and
not
a
single
mingo
shall
cross
without
suffering
for
his
boldness
had
you
not
better
leave
the
rifle
on
the
rock
and
swim
to
us
before
the
rascals
can
get
afloat
a
true
woodsman
never
quits
his
piece
while
he
has
any
powder
in
his
horn
or
a
bullet
in
his
pouch
i
have
not
drawn
a
trigger
this
day
and
should
relish
the
idea
of
parting
with
those
reptiles
without
causing
them
to
remember
my
name
a
little
water
will
not
harm
my
legs
and
i
see
that
blackguard
arrowhead
among
the
scamps
and
wish
to
send
him
the
wages
he
has
so
faithfully
earned
you
have
not
brought
the
sergeant
daughter
down
here
in
a
range
with
their
bullets
i
hope
jasper
she
is
safe
for
the
present
at
least
though
all
depends
on
our
keeping
the
river
between
us
and
the
enemy
they
must
know
our
weakness
now
and
should
they
cross
no
doubt
some
of
their
party
will
be
left
on
the
other
this
canoeing
touches
your
gifts
rather
than
mine
boy
though
i
will
handle
a
paddle
with
the
best
mingo
that
ever
struck
a
salmon
if
they
cross
below
the
rift
why
ca
we
cross
in
the
still
water
above
and
keep
playing
at
dodge
and
turn
with
the
wolves
because
as
i
have
said
they
will
leave
a
party
on
the
other
shore
and
then
pathfinder
would
you
expose
mabel
to
the
rifles
of
the
iroquois
the
sergeant
daughter
must
be
saved
returned
the
guide
with
calm
energy
you
are
right
jasper
she
has
no
gift
to
authorize
her
in
offering
her
sweet
face
and
tender
body
to
a
mingo
rifle
what
can
be
done
then
they
must
be
kept
from
crossing
for
an
hour
or
two
if
possible
when
we
must
do
our
best
in
the
i
agree
with
you
pathfinder
if
it
can
be
effected
but
are
we
strong
enough
for
such
a
purpose
the
lord
is
with
us
boy
the
lord
is
with
us
and
it
is
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
one
like
the
sergeant
daughter
will
be
altogether
abandoned
by
providence
in
such
a
strait
there
is
not
a
boat
between
the
falls
and
the
garrison
except
these
two
canoes
to
my
sartain
knowledge
and
i
think
it
will
go
beyond
gifts
to
cross
in
the
face
of
two
rifles
like
these
of
yourn
and
mine
i
will
not
vaunt
jasper
but
it
is
well
known
on
all
this
frontier
that
killdeer
seldom
your
skill
is
admitted
by
all
far
and
near
pathfinder
but
a
rifle
takes
time
to
be
loaded
nor
are
you
on
the
land
aided
by
a
good
cover
where
you
can
work
to
the
advantage
you
are
used
to
if
you
had
our
canoe
might
you
not
pass
to
the
shore
with
a
dry
rifle
can
an
eagle
fly
jasper
returned
the
other
laughing
in
his
usual
manner
and
looking
back
as
he
spoke
but
it
would
be
unwise
to
expose
yourself
on
the
water
for
them
miscreants
are
beginning
to
bethink
them
again
of
powder
and
it
can
be
done
without
any
such
chances
master
cap
has
gone
up
to
the
canoe
and
will
cast
the
branch
of
a
tree
into
the
river
to
try
the
current
which
sets
from
the
point
above
in
the
direction
of
your
rock
see
there
it
comes
already
if
it
float
fairly
you
must
raise
your
arm
when
the
canoe
will
follow
at
all
events
if
the
boat
should
pass
you
the
eddy
below
will
bring
it
up
and
i
can
recover
while
jasper
was
still
speaking
the
floating
branch
came
in
sight
and
quickening
its
progress
with
the
increasing
velocity
of
the
current
it
swept
swiftly
down
towards
the
pathfinder
who
seized
it
as
it
was
passing
and
held
it
in
the
air
as
a
sign
of
success
cap
understood
the
signal
and
presently
the
canoe
was
launched
into
the
stream
with
a
caution
and
an
intelligence
that
the
habits
of
the
mariner
had
fitted
him
to
observe
it
floated
in
the
same
direction
as
the
branch
and
in
a
minute
was
arrested
by
the
pathfinder
this
has
been
done
with
a
frontier
man
judgment
jasper
said
the
guide
laughing
but
you
have
your
gifts
which
incline
most
to
the
water
as
mine
incline
to
the
woods
now
let
them
mingo
knaves
cock
their
rifles
and
get
rests
for
this
is
the
last
chance
they
are
likely
to
have
at
a
man
without
a
nay
shove
the
canoe
towards
the
shore
quartering
the
current
and
throw
yourself
into
it
as
it
goes
off
said
jasper
eagerly
there
is
little
use
in
running
any
i
love
to
stand
up
face
to
face
with
my
enemies
like
a
man
while
they
set
me
the
example
returned
the
pathfinder
proudly
i
am
not
a
born
and
it
is
more
a
white
man
gifts
to
fight
openly
than
to
lie
in
and
mabel
true
boy
true
the
sergeant
daughter
must
be
saved
and
as
you
say
foolish
risks
only
become
boys
think
you
that
you
can
catch
the
canoe
where
you
stand
there
can
be
no
doubt
if
you
give
a
vigorous
pathfinder
made
the
necessary
effort
the
light
bark
shot
across
the
intervening
space
and
jasper
seized
it
as
it
came
to
land
to
secure
the
canoe
and
to
take
proper
positions
in
the
cover
occupied
the
friends
but
a
moment
when
they
shook
hands
cordially
like
those
who
had
met
after
a
long
separation
now
jasper
we
shall
see
if
a
mingo
of
them
all
dares
cross
the
oswego
in
the
teeth
of
killdeer
you
are
handier
with
the
oar
and
the
paddle
and
the
sail
than
with
the
rifle
perhaps
but
you
have
a
stout
heart
and
a
steady
hand
and
them
are
things
that
count
in
a
mabel
will
find
me
between
her
and
her
enemies
said
jasper
calmly
yes
yes
the
sergeant
daughter
must
be
protected
i
like
you
boy
on
your
own
account
but
i
like
you
all
the
better
that
you
think
of
one
so
feeble
at
a
moment
when
there
is
need
of
all
your
manhood
see
jasper
three
of
the
knaves
are
actually
getting
into
the
canoe
they
must
believe
we
have
fled
or
they
would
not
surely
venture
so
much
directly
in
the
very
face
of
sure
enough
the
iroquois
did
appear
bent
on
venturing
across
the
stream
for
as
the
pathfinder
and
his
friends
now
kept
their
persons
strictly
concealed
their
enemies
began
to
think
that
the
latter
had
taken
to
flight
such
a
course
was
that
which
most
white
men
would
have
followed
but
mabel
was
under
the
care
of
those
who
were
much
too
well
skilled
in
forest
warfare
to
neglect
to
defend
the
only
pass
that
in
truth
now
offered
even
a
probable
chance
for
protection
as
the
pathfinder
had
said
three
warriors
were
in
the
canoe
two
holding
their
rifles
at
a
poise
as
they
knelt
in
readiness
to
aim
the
deadly
weapons
and
the
other
standing
erect
in
the
stern
to
wield
the
paddle
in
this
manner
they
left
the
shore
having
had
the
precaution
to
haul
the
canoe
previously
to
entering
it
so
far
up
the
stream
as
to
have
got
into
the
comparatively
still
water
above
the
rift
it
was
apparent
at
a
glance
that
the
savage
who
guided
the
boat
was
skilled
in
the
art
for
the
long
steady
sweep
of
his
paddle
sent
the
light
bark
over
the
glassy
surface
of
the
tranquil
river
as
if
it
were
a
feather
floating
in
air
shall
i
fire
demanded
jasper
in
a
whisper
trembling
with
eagerness
to
engage
not
yet
boy
not
yet
there
are
but
three
of
them
and
if
master
cap
yonder
knows
how
to
use
the
popguns
he
carries
in
his
belt
we
may
even
let
them
land
and
then
we
shall
recover
the
but
mabel
no
fear
for
the
sergeant
daughter
she
is
safe
in
the
hollow
stump
you
say
with
the
opening
judgmatically
hid
by
the
brambles
if
what
you
tell
me
of
the
manner
in
which
you
concealed
the
trail
be
true
the
sweet
one
might
lie
there
a
month
and
laugh
at
the
we
are
never
certain
i
wish
we
had
brought
her
nearer
to
our
own
cover
what
for
to
place
her
pretty
little
head
and
leaping
heart
among
flying
bullets
no
no
she
is
better
where
she
is
because
she
is
we
are
never
certain
we
thought
ourselves
safe
behind
the
bushes
and
yet
you
saw
that
we
were
and
the
mingo
imp
paid
for
his
curiosity
as
these
knaves
are
about
to
the
pathfinder
ceased
speaking
for
at
that
instant
the
sharp
report
of
a
rifle
was
heard
when
the
indian
in
the
stern
of
the
canoe
leaped
high
into
the
air
and
fell
into
the
water
holding
the
paddle
in
his
hand
a
small
wreath
of
smoke
floated
out
from
among
the
bushes
of
the
eastern
shore
and
was
soon
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
that
is
the
sarpent
hissing
exclaimed
the
pathfinder
exultingly
a
bolder
or
a
truer
heart
never
beat
in
the
breast
of
a
delaware
i
am
sorry
that
he
interfered
but
he
could
not
have
known
our
the
canoe
had
no
sooner
lost
its
guide
than
it
floated
with
the
stream
and
was
soon
sucked
into
the
rapids
of
the
rift
perfectly
helpless
the
two
remaining
savages
gazed
wildly
about
them
but
could
offer
no
resistance
to
the
power
of
the
element
it
was
perhaps
fortunate
for
chingachgook
that
the
attention
of
most
of
the
iroquois
was
intently
given
to
the
situation
of
those
in
the
boat
else
would
his
escape
have
been
to
the
last
degree
difficult
if
not
totally
impracticable
but
not
a
foe
moved
except
to
conceal
his
person
behind
some
cover
and
every
eye
was
riveted
on
the
two
remaining
adventurers
in
less
time
than
has
been
necessary
to
record
these
occurrences
the
canoe
was
whirling
and
tossing
in
the
rift
while
both
the
savages
had
stretched
themselves
in
its
bottom
as
the
only
means
of
preserving
the
equilibrium
this
natural
expedient
soon
failed
them
for
striking
a
rock
the
light
draft
rolled
over
and
the
two
warriors
were
thrown
into
the
river
the
water
is
seldom
deep
on
a
rift
except
in
particular
places
where
it
may
have
worn
channels
and
there
was
little
to
be
apprehended
from
drowning
though
their
arms
were
lost
and
the
two
savages
were
fain
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
to
the
friendly
shore
swimming
and
wading
as
circumstances
required
the
canoe
itself
lodged
on
a
rock
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
where
for
the
moment
it
became
useless
to
both
parties
now
is
our
time
pathfinder
cried
jasper
as
the
two
iroquois
exposed
most
of
their
persons
while
wading
in
the
shallowest
part
of
the
rapids
the
fellow
up
stream
is
mine
and
you
can
take
the
so
excited
had
the
young
man
become
by
all
the
incidents
of
the
stirring
scene
that
the
bullet
sped
from
his
rifle
as
he
spoke
but
uselessly
as
it
would
seem
for
both
the
fugitives
tossed
their
arms
in
disdain
the
pathfinder
did
not
fire
no
no
he
answered
i
do
not
seek
blood
without
a
cause
and
my
bullet
is
well
leathered
and
carefully
driven
down
for
the
time
of
need
i
love
no
mingo
as
is
just
seeing
how
much
i
have
consorted
with
the
delawares
who
are
their
mortal
and
natural
enemies
but
i
never
pull
trigger
on
one
of
the
miscreants
unless
it
be
plain
that
his
death
will
lead
to
some
good
end
the
deer
never
leaped
that
fell
by
my
hand
wantonly
by
living
much
alone
with
god
in
the
wilderness
a
man
gets
to
feel
the
justice
of
such
opinions
one
life
is
sufficient
for
our
present
wants
and
there
may
yet
be
occasion
to
use
killdeer
in
behalf
of
the
sarpent
who
has
done
an
untimorsome
thing
to
let
them
rampant
devils
so
plainly
know
that
he
is
in
their
neighborhood
as
a
wicked
sinner
there
is
one
of
them
prowling
along
the
bank
this
very
moment
like
one
of
the
boys
of
the
garrison
skulking
behind
a
fallen
tree
to
get
a
shot
at
a
squirrel
as
the
pathfinder
pointed
with
his
finger
while
speaking
the
quick
eye
of
jasper
soon
caught
the
object
towards
which
it
was
directed
one
of
the
young
warriors
of
the
enemy
burning
with
a
desire
to
distinguish
himself
had
stolen
from
his
party
towards
the
cover
in
which
chingachgook
had
concealed
himself
and
as
the
latter
was
deceived
by
the
apparent
apathy
of
his
foes
as
well
as
engaged
in
some
further
preparations
of
his
own
he
had
evidently
obtained
a
position
where
he
got
a
sight
of
the
delaware
this
circumstance
was
apparent
by
the
arrangements
the
iroquois
was
making
to
fire
for
chingachgook
himself
was
not
visible
from
the
western
side
of
the
river
the
rift
was
at
a
bend
in
the
oswego
and
the
sweep
of
the
eastern
shore
formed
a
curve
so
wide
that
chingachgook
was
quite
near
to
his
enemies
in
a
straight
direction
though
separated
by
several
hundred
feet
on
the
land
owing
to
which
fact
air
lines
brought
both
parties
nearly
equidistant
from
the
pathfinder
and
jasper
the
general
width
of
the
river
being
a
little
less
than
two
hundred
yards
such
necessarily
was
about
the
distance
between
his
two
observers
and
the
skulking
iroquois
the
sarpent
must
be
thereabouts
observed
pathfinder
who
never
turned
his
eye
for
an
instant
from
the
young
warrior
and
yet
he
must
be
strangely
off
his
guard
to
allow
a
mingo
devil
to
get
his
stand
so
near
with
manifest
signs
of
bloodshed
in
his
see
interrupted
jasper
there
is
the
body
of
the
indian
the
delaware
shot
it
has
drifted
on
a
rock
and
the
current
has
forced
the
head
and
face
above
the
quite
likely
boy
quite
likely
human
natur
is
little
better
than
a
log
of
driftwood
when
the
life
that
was
breathed
into
its
nostrils
is
departed
that
iroquois
will
never
harm
any
one
more
but
yonder
skulking
savage
is
bent
on
taking
the
scalp
of
my
best
and
most
tried
the
pathfinder
suddenly
interrupted
himself
by
raising
his
rifle
a
weapon
of
unusual
length
with
admirable
precision
and
firing
the
instant
it
had
got
its
level
the
iroquois
on
the
opposite
shore
was
in
the
act
of
aiming
when
the
fatal
messenger
from
killdeer
arrived
his
rifle
was
discharged
it
is
true
but
it
was
with
the
muzzle
in
the
air
while
the
man
himself
plunged
into
the
bushes
quite
evidently
hurt
if
not
slain
the
skulking
reptyle
brought
it
on
himself
muttered
pathfinder
sternly
as
dropping
the
butt
of
his
rifle
he
carefully
commenced
reloading
it
chingachgook
and
i
have
consorted
together
since
we
were
boys
and
have
in
company
on
the
horican
the
mohawk
the
ontario
and
all
the
other
bloody
passes
between
the
country
of
the
frenchers
and
our
own
and
did
the
foolish
knave
believe
that
i
would
stand
by
and
see
my
best
friend
cut
off
in
an
ambushment
we
have
served
the
sarpent
as
good
a
turn
as
he
served
us
those
rascals
are
troubled
pathfinder
and
are
falling
back
into
their
covers
since
they
find
we
can
reach
them
across
the
the
shot
is
no
great
matter
jasper
no
great
matter
ask
any
of
the
and
they
can
tell
you
what
killdeer
can
do
and
has
done
and
that
too
when
the
bullets
were
flying
about
our
heads
like
hailstones
no
no
this
is
no
great
matter
and
the
unthoughtful
vagabond
drew
it
down
on
is
that
a
dog
or
a
deer
swimming
towards
this
shore
pathfinder
started
for
sure
enough
an
object
was
crossing
the
stream
above
the
rift
towards
which
however
it
was
gradually
setting
by
the
force
of
the
current
a
second
look
satisfied
both
the
observers
that
it
was
a
man
and
an
indian
though
so
concealed
as
at
first
to
render
it
doubtful
some
stratagem
was
apprehended
and
the
closest
attention
was
given
to
the
movements
of
the
stranger
he
is
pushing
something
before
him
as
he
swims
and
his
head
resembles
a
drifting
bush
said
jasper
is
indian
devilry
boy
but
christian
honesty
shall
circumvent
their
as
the
man
slowly
approached
the
observers
began
to
doubt
the
accuracy
of
their
first
impressions
and
it
was
only
when
of
the
stream
were
passed
that
the
truth
was
really
known
the
big
sarpent
as
i
live
exclaimed
pathfinder
looking
at
his
companion
and
laughing
until
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
with
pure
delight
at
the
success
of
the
artifice
he
has
tied
bushes
to
his
head
so
as
to
hide
it
put
the
horn
on
top
lashed
the
rifle
to
that
bit
of
log
he
is
pushing
before
him
and
has
come
over
to
join
his
friends
ah
me
the
times
and
times
that
he
and
i
have
cut
such
pranks
right
in
the
teeth
of
mingos
raging
for
our
blood
in
the
great
thoroughfare
round
and
about
ty
it
may
not
be
the
serpent
after
all
pathfinder
i
can
see
no
feature
that
i
feature
who
looks
for
features
in
an
indian
no
no
boy
is
the
paint
that
speaks
and
none
but
a
delaware
would
wear
that
paint
them
are
his
colors
jasper
just
as
your
craft
on
the
lake
wears
george
cross
and
the
frenchers
set
their
tablecloths
to
fluttering
in
the
wind
with
all
the
stains
of
and
venison
steaks
upon
them
now
you
see
the
eye
lad
and
it
is
the
eye
of
a
chief
but
fierce
as
it
is
in
battle
and
glassy
as
it
looks
from
among
the
leaves
here
the
pathfinder
laid
his
fingers
lightly
but
impressively
on
his
companion
arm
i
have
seen
it
shed
tears
like
rain
there
is
a
soul
and
a
heart
under
that
red
skin
rely
on
it
although
they
are
a
soul
and
a
heart
with
gifts
different
from
our
no
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
chief
ever
doubted
i
it
returned
the
other
proudly
for
i
have
consorted
with
him
in
sorrow
and
in
joy
in
one
i
have
found
him
a
man
however
stricken
in
the
other
a
chief
who
knows
that
the
women
of
his
tribe
are
the
most
seemly
in
light
merriment
but
hist
it
is
too
much
like
the
people
of
the
settlements
to
pour
soft
speeches
into
another
ear
and
the
sarpent
has
keen
senses
he
knows
i
love
him
and
that
i
speak
well
of
him
behind
his
back
but
a
delaware
has
modesty
in
his
inmost
natur
though
he
will
brag
like
a
sinner
when
tied
to
a
the
serpent
now
reached
the
shore
directly
in
the
front
of
his
two
comrades
with
whose
precise
position
he
must
have
been
acquainted
before
leaving
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
and
rising
from
the
water
he
shook
himself
like
a
dog
and
made
the
usual
exclamation
hugh
chapter
vi
these
as
they
change
almighty
father
these
are
but
the
varied
god
thomson
as
the
chief
landed
he
was
met
by
the
pathfinder
who
addressed
him
in
the
language
of
the
warrior
people
was
it
well
done
chingachgook
said
he
reproachfully
to
ambush
a
dozen
mingos
alone
killdeer
seldom
fails
me
it
is
true
but
the
oswego
makes
a
distant
mark
and
that
miscreant
showed
little
more
than
his
head
and
shoulders
above
the
bushes
and
an
onpractysed
hand
and
eye
might
have
failed
you
should
have
thought
of
this
chief
you
should
have
thought
of
this
the
great
serpent
is
a
mohican
warrior
he
sees
only
his
enemies
when
he
is
on
the
and
his
fathers
have
struck
the
mingos
from
behind
since
the
waters
began
to
i
know
your
gifts
i
know
your
gifts
and
respect
them
too
no
man
shall
hear
me
complain
that
a
obsarved
natur
but
prudence
as
much
becomes
a
warrior
as
valor
and
had
not
the
iroquois
devils
been
looking
after
their
friends
who
were
in
the
water
a
hot
trail
they
would
have
made
of
what
is
the
delaware
about
to
do
exclaimed
jasper
who
observed
at
that
moment
that
the
chief
had
suddenly
left
the
pathfinder
and
advanced
to
the
water
edge
apparently
with
an
intention
of
again
entering
the
river
he
will
not
be
so
mad
as
to
return
to
the
other
shore
for
any
trifle
he
may
have
forgotten
not
he
not
he
he
is
as
prudent
as
he
is
brave
in
the
main
though
so
forgetful
of
himself
in
the
late
ambushment
jasper
leading
the
other
a
little
aside
just
as
they
heard
the
indian
plunge
into
the
water
lad
chingachgook
is
not
a
christian
white
man
like
ourselves
but
a
mohican
chief
who
has
his
gifts
and
traditions
to
tell
him
what
he
ought
to
do
and
he
who
consorts
with
them
that
are
not
strictly
and
altogether
of
his
own
kind
had
better
leave
natur
and
use
to
govern
his
comrades
a
king
soldier
will
swear
and
he
will
drink
and
it
is
of
little
use
to
try
to
prevent
him
a
gentleman
likes
his
delicacies
and
a
lady
her
feathers
and
it
does
not
avail
much
to
struggle
against
either
whereas
an
indian
natur
and
gifts
are
much
stronger
than
these
and
no
doubt
were
bestowed
by
the
lord
for
wise
ends
though
neither
you
nor
me
can
follow
them
in
all
their
what
does
this
mean
see
the
delaware
is
swimming
towards
the
body
that
is
lodged
on
the
rock
why
does
he
risk
this
for
honor
and
glory
and
renown
as
great
gentlemen
quit
their
quiet
homes
beyond
seas
where
as
they
tell
me
heart
has
nothing
left
to
wish
for
that
is
such
hearts
as
can
be
satisfied
in
a
clearing
to
come
hither
to
live
on
game
and
fight
the
i
understand
you
your
friend
has
gone
to
secure
the
is
his
gift
and
let
him
enjoy
it
we
are
white
men
and
can
not
mangle
a
dead
enemy
but
it
is
honor
in
the
eyes
of
a
to
do
so
it
may
seem
singular
to
you
but
i
known
white
men
of
great
name
and
character
manifest
as
remarkable
idees
consarning
their
honor
i
a
savage
will
be
a
savage
pathfinder
let
him
keep
what
company
he
it
is
well
for
us
to
say
so
lad
but
as
i
tell
you
white
honor
will
not
always
conform
to
reason
or
to
the
will
of
god
i
have
passed
days
thinking
of
these
matters
out
in
the
silent
woods
and
i
have
come
to
the
opinion
boy
that
as
providence
rules
all
things
no
gift
is
bestowed
without
some
wise
and
reasonable
the
serpent
greatly
exposes
himself
to
the
enemy
in
order
to
get
his
scalp
this
may
lose
us
the
not
in
his
mind
jasper
that
one
scalp
has
more
honor
in
it
according
to
the
sarpent
notions
of
warfare
than
a
field
covered
with
slain
that
kept
the
hair
on
their
heads
now
there
was
the
fine
young
captain
of
the
that
threw
away
his
life
in
trying
to
bring
off
a
from
among
the
frenchers
in
the
last
skrimmage
we
had
he
thought
he
was
sarving
honor
and
i
have
known
a
young
ensign
wrap
himself
up
in
his
colors
and
go
to
sleep
in
his
blood
fancying
that
he
was
lying
on
something
softer
even
than
yes
yes
one
can
understand
the
merit
of
not
hauling
down
an
and
these
are
chingachgook
colors
he
will
keep
them
to
show
his
children
children
here
the
pathfinder
interrupted
himself
shook
his
head
in
melancholy
and
slowly
added
ah
me
no
shoot
of
the
old
mohican
stem
remains
he
has
no
children
to
delight
with
his
trophies
no
tribe
to
honor
by
his
deeds
he
is
a
lone
man
in
this
world
and
yet
he
stands
true
to
his
training
and
his
gifts
there
is
something
honest
and
respectable
in
these
you
must
allow
here
a
great
outcry
from
the
iroquois
was
succeeded
by
the
quick
reports
of
their
rifles
and
so
eager
did
the
enemy
become
in
the
desire
to
drive
the
delaware
back
from
his
victim
that
a
dozen
rushed
into
the
river
several
of
whom
even
advanced
near
a
hundred
feet
into
the
foaming
current
as
if
they
actually
meditated
a
serious
sortie
but
chingachgook
continued
unmoved
as
he
remained
unhurt
by
the
missiles
accomplishing
his
task
with
the
dexterity
of
long
habit
flourishing
his
reeking
trophy
he
gave
the
in
its
most
frightful
intonations
and
for
a
minute
the
arches
of
the
silent
woods
and
the
deep
vista
formed
by
the
course
of
the
river
echoed
with
cries
so
terrific
that
mabel
bowed
her
head
in
irrepressible
fear
while
her
uncle
for
a
single
instant
actually
meditated
flight
this
surpasses
all
i
have
heard
from
the
wretches
jasper
exclaimed
stopping
his
ears
equally
in
horror
and
disgust
is
their
music
boy
their
drum
and
fife
their
trumpets
and
clarions
no
doubt
they
love
those
sounds
for
they
stir
up
in
them
fierce
feelings
and
a
desire
for
blood
returned
the
pathfinder
totally
unmoved
i
thought
them
rather
frightful
when
a
mere
youngster
but
they
have
become
like
the
whistle
of
the
whippoorwill
or
the
song
of
the
in
my
ear
now
all
the
screeching
reptyles
that
could
stand
between
the
falls
and
the
garrison
would
have
no
effect
on
my
narves
at
this
time
of
day
i
say
it
not
in
boasting
jasper
for
the
man
that
lets
in
cowardice
through
the
ears
must
have
but
a
weak
heart
at
the
best
sounds
and
outcries
being
more
intended
to
alarm
women
and
children
than
such
as
scout
the
forest
and
face
the
foe
i
hope
the
sarpent
is
now
satisfied
for
here
he
comes
with
the
scalp
at
his
jasper
turned
away
his
head
as
the
delaware
rose
from
the
water
in
pure
disgust
at
his
late
errand
but
the
pathfinder
regarded
his
friend
with
the
philosophical
indifference
of
one
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
indifferent
to
things
he
deemed
immaterial
as
the
delaware
passed
deeper
into
the
bushes
with
a
view
to
wring
his
trifling
calico
dress
and
to
prepare
his
rifle
for
service
he
gave
one
glance
of
triumph
at
his
companions
and
then
all
emotion
connected
with
the
recent
exploit
seemed
to
cease
jasper
resumed
the
guide
step
down
to
the
station
of
master
cap
and
ask
him
to
join
us
we
have
little
time
for
a
council
and
yet
our
plans
must
be
laid
quickly
for
it
will
not
be
long
before
them
mingos
will
be
plotting
our
the
young
man
complied
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
four
were
assembled
near
the
shore
completely
concealed
from
the
view
of
their
enemies
while
they
kept
a
vigilant
watch
over
the
proceedings
of
the
latter
in
order
to
consult
on
their
own
future
movements
by
this
time
the
day
had
so
far
advanced
as
to
leave
but
a
few
minutes
between
the
passing
light
and
an
obscurity
that
promised
to
be
even
deeper
than
common
the
sun
had
already
set
and
the
twilight
of
a
low
latitude
would
soon
pass
into
the
darkness
of
deep
night
most
of
the
hopes
of
the
party
rested
on
this
favorable
circumstance
though
it
was
not
without
its
dangers
also
as
the
very
obscurity
which
would
favor
their
escape
would
be
as
likely
to
conceal
the
movements
of
their
wily
enemies
the
moment
has
come
men
pathfinder
commenced
when
our
plans
must
be
coolly
laid
in
order
that
we
may
act
together
and
with
a
right
understanding
of
our
errand
and
gifts
in
an
hour
time
these
woods
will
be
as
dark
as
midnight
and
if
we
are
ever
to
gain
the
garrison
it
must
be
done
under
favor
of
this
advantage
what
say
you
master
cap
for
though
none
of
the
most
experienced
in
combats
and
retreats
in
the
woods
your
years
entitle
you
to
speak
first
in
a
matter
like
this
and
in
a
well
in
my
judgment
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
go
on
board
the
canoe
when
it
gets
to
be
so
dark
the
enemy
lookouts
ca
see
us
and
run
for
the
haven
as
wind
and
tide
will
that
is
easily
said
but
not
so
easily
done
returned
the
guide
we
shall
be
more
exposed
in
the
river
than
by
following
the
woods
and
then
there
is
the
oswego
rift
below
us
and
i
am
far
from
sartain
that
jasper
himself
can
carry
a
boat
safely
through
it
in
the
dark
what
say
you
lad
as
to
your
own
skill
and
judgment
i
am
of
master
cap
opinion
about
using
the
canoe
mabel
is
too
tender
to
walk
through
swamps
and
among
roots
of
trees
in
such
a
night
as
this
promises
to
be
and
then
i
always
feel
myself
stouter
of
heart
and
truer
of
eye
when
afloat
than
when
stout
of
heart
you
always
be
lad
and
i
think
tolerably
true
of
eye
for
one
who
has
lived
so
much
in
broad
sunshine
and
so
little
in
the
woods
ah
me
the
ontario
has
no
trees
or
it
would
be
a
plain
to
delight
a
hunter
heart
as
to
your
opinion
friends
there
is
much
for
and
much
against
it
for
it
it
may
be
said
water
leaves
no
trail
what
do
you
call
the
wake
interrupted
the
pertinacious
and
dogmatical
cap
anan
go
on
said
jasper
master
cap
thinks
he
is
on
the
ocean
water
leaves
no
trail
it
leaves
none
hereaway
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
what
it
may
leave
on
the
sea
then
a
canoe
is
both
swift
and
easy
when
it
floats
with
the
current
and
the
tender
limbs
of
the
daughter
will
be
favored
by
its
motion
but
on
the
other
hand
the
river
will
have
no
cover
but
the
clouds
in
the
heavens
the
rift
is
a
ticklish
thing
for
boats
to
venture
into
even
by
daylight
and
it
is
six
fairly
measured
miles
by
water
from
this
spot
to
the
garrison
then
a
trail
on
land
is
not
easy
to
be
found
in
the
dark
i
am
troubled
jasper
to
say
which
way
we
ought
to
counsel
and
if
the
serpent
and
myself
could
swim
into
the
river
and
bring
off
the
other
canoe
the
young
sailor
replied
it
would
seem
to
me
that
our
safest
course
would
be
the
if
indeed
and
yet
it
might
easily
be
done
as
soon
as
it
is
a
little
darker
well
well
i
am
not
sartain
it
will
not
be
the
best
though
were
we
only
a
party
of
men
it
would
be
like
a
hunt
to
the
lusty
and
brave
to
play
at
with
yonder
miscreants
on
the
other
shore
jasper
continued
the
guide
into
whose
character
there
entered
no
ingredient
which
belonged
to
vain
display
or
theatrical
effect
will
you
undertake
to
bring
in
the
canoe
i
will
undertake
anything
that
will
serve
and
protect
mabel
that
is
an
upright
feeling
and
i
suppose
it
is
natur
the
sarpent
who
is
nearly
naked
already
can
help
you
and
this
will
be
cutting
off
one
of
the
means
of
them
devils
to
work
their
this
material
point
being
settled
the
different
members
of
the
party
prepared
themselves
to
put
the
project
in
execution
the
shades
of
evening
fell
fast
upon
the
forest
and
by
the
time
all
was
ready
for
the
attempt
it
was
found
impossible
to
discern
objects
on
the
opposite
shore
time
now
pressed
for
indian
cunning
could
devise
so
many
expedients
for
passing
so
narrow
a
stream
that
the
pathfinder
was
getting
impatient
to
quit
the
spot
while
jasper
and
his
companion
entered
the
river
armed
with
nothing
but
their
knives
and
the
delaware
tomahawk
observing
the
greatest
caution
not
to
betray
their
movements
the
guide
brought
mabel
from
her
place
of
concealment
and
bidding
her
and
cap
proceed
along
the
shore
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
he
got
into
the
canoe
that
remained
in
his
possession
in
order
to
carry
it
to
the
same
place
this
was
easily
effected
the
canoe
was
laid
against
the
bank
and
mabel
and
her
uncle
entered
it
taking
their
seats
as
usual
while
the
pathfinder
erect
in
the
stern
held
by
a
bush
in
order
to
prevent
the
swift
stream
from
sweeping
them
down
its
current
several
minutes
of
intense
and
breathless
expectation
followed
while
they
awaited
the
results
of
the
bold
attempt
of
their
comrades
it
will
be
understood
that
the
two
adventurers
were
compelled
to
swim
across
a
deep
and
rapid
channel
before
they
could
reach
a
part
of
the
rift
that
admitted
of
wading
this
portion
of
the
enterprise
was
soon
effected
and
jasper
and
the
serpent
struck
the
bottom
side
by
side
at
the
same
instant
having
secured
firm
footing
they
took
hold
of
each
other
hands
and
waded
slowly
and
with
extreme
caution
in
the
supposed
direction
of
the
canoe
but
the
darkness
was
already
so
deep
that
they
soon
ascertained
they
were
to
be
but
little
aided
by
the
sense
of
sight
and
that
their
search
must
be
conducted
on
that
species
of
instinct
which
enables
the
woodsman
to
find
his
way
when
the
sun
is
hid
no
stars
appear
and
all
would
seem
chaos
to
one
less
accustomed
to
the
mazes
of
the
forest
under
these
circumstances
jasper
submitted
to
be
guided
by
the
delaware
whose
habits
best
fitted
him
to
take
the
lead
still
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
wade
amid
the
roaring
element
at
that
hour
and
retain
a
clear
recollection
of
the
localities
by
the
time
they
believed
themselves
to
be
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
the
two
shores
were
discernible
merely
by
masses
of
obscurity
denser
than
common
the
outlines
against
the
clouds
being
barely
distinguishable
by
the
ragged
tops
of
the
trees
once
or
twice
the
wanderers
altered
their
course
in
consequence
of
unexpectedly
stepping
into
deep
water
for
they
knew
that
the
boat
had
lodged
on
the
shallowest
part
of
the
rift
in
short
with
this
fact
for
their
compass
jasper
and
his
companion
wandered
about
in
the
water
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
at
the
end
of
that
period
which
began
to
appear
interminable
to
the
young
man
they
found
themselves
apparently
no
nearer
the
object
of
their
search
than
they
had
been
at
its
commencement
just
as
the
delaware
was
about
to
stop
in
order
to
inform
his
associate
that
they
would
do
well
to
return
to
the
land
in
order
to
take
a
fresh
departure
he
saw
the
form
of
a
man
moving
about
in
the
water
almost
within
reach
of
his
arm
jasper
was
at
his
side
and
he
at
once
understood
that
the
iroquois
were
engaged
on
the
same
errand
as
he
was
himself
mingo
he
uttered
in
jasper
ear
the
serpent
will
show
his
brother
how
to
be
the
young
sailor
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
figure
at
that
instant
and
the
startling
truth
also
flashed
on
his
mind
understanding
the
necessity
of
trusting
all
to
the
delaware
chief
he
kept
back
while
his
friend
moved
cautiously
in
the
direction
in
which
the
strange
form
had
vanished
in
another
moment
it
was
seen
again
evidently
moving
towards
themselves
the
waters
made
such
an
uproar
that
little
was
to
be
apprehended
from
ordinary
sounds
and
the
indian
turning
his
head
hastily
said
leave
it
to
the
cunning
of
the
great
hugh
exclaimed
the
strange
savage
adding
in
the
language
of
his
people
the
canoe
is
found
but
there
were
none
to
help
me
come
let
us
raise
it
from
the
willingly
answered
chingachgook
who
understood
the
dialect
lead
we
will
the
stranger
unable
to
distinguish
between
voices
and
accents
amid
the
raging
of
the
rapid
led
the
way
in
the
necessary
direction
and
the
two
others
keeping
close
at
his
heels
all
three
speedily
reached
the
canoe
the
iroquois
laid
hold
of
one
end
chingachgook
placed
himself
in
the
centre
and
jasper
went
to
the
opposite
extremity
as
it
was
important
that
the
stranger
should
not
detect
the
presence
of
a
a
discovery
that
might
be
made
by
the
parts
of
the
dress
the
young
man
still
wore
as
well
as
by
the
general
appearance
of
his
head
lift
said
the
iroquois
in
the
sententious
manner
of
his
race
and
by
a
trifling
effort
the
canoe
was
raised
from
the
rock
held
a
moment
in
the
air
to
empty
it
and
then
placed
carefully
on
the
water
in
its
proper
position
all
three
held
it
firmly
lest
it
should
escape
from
their
hands
under
the
pressure
of
the
violent
current
while
the
iroquois
who
led
of
course
being
at
the
upper
end
of
the
boat
took
the
direction
of
the
eastern
shore
or
towards
the
spot
where
his
friends
waited
his
return
as
the
delaware
and
jasper
well
knew
there
must
be
several
more
of
the
iroquois
on
the
rift
from
the
circumstance
that
their
own
appearance
had
occasioned
no
surprise
in
the
individual
they
had
met
both
felt
the
necessity
of
extreme
caution
men
less
bold
and
determined
would
have
thought
that
they
were
incurring
too
great
a
risk
by
thus
venturing
into
the
midst
of
their
enemies
but
these
hardy
borderers
were
unacquainted
with
fear
were
accustomed
to
hazards
and
so
well
understood
the
necessity
of
at
least
preventing
their
foes
from
getting
the
boat
that
they
would
have
cheerfully
encountered
even
greater
risks
to
secure
their
object
so
to
the
safety
of
mabel
indeed
did
jasper
deem
the
possession
or
the
destruction
of
this
canoe
that
he
had
drawn
his
knife
and
stood
ready
to
rip
up
the
bark
in
order
to
render
the
boat
temporarily
unserviceable
should
anything
occur
to
compel
the
delaware
and
himself
to
abandon
their
prize
in
the
meantime
the
iroquois
who
led
the
way
proceeded
slowly
through
the
water
in
the
direction
of
his
own
party
still
grasping
the
canoe
and
dragging
his
reluctant
followers
in
his
train
once
chingachgook
raised
his
tomahawk
and
was
about
to
bury
it
in
the
brain
of
his
confiding
and
unsuspicious
neighbor
but
the
probability
that
the
or
the
floating
body
might
give
the
alarm
induced
that
wary
chief
to
change
his
purpose
at
the
next
moment
he
regretted
this
indecision
for
the
three
who
clung
to
the
canoe
suddenly
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
a
party
of
no
less
than
four
others
who
were
in
quest
of
it
after
the
usual
brief
characteristic
exclamations
of
satisfaction
the
savages
eagerly
laid
hold
of
the
canoe
for
all
seemed
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
securing
this
important
boat
the
one
side
in
order
to
assail
their
foes
and
the
other
to
secure
their
retreat
the
addition
to
the
party
however
was
so
and
so
completely
gave
the
enemy
the
superiority
that
for
a
few
moments
the
ingenuity
and
address
of
even
the
delaware
were
at
fault
the
five
iroquois
who
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
their
errand
pressed
forward
towards
their
own
shore
without
pausing
to
converse
their
object
being
in
truth
to
obtain
the
paddles
which
they
had
previously
secured
and
to
embark
three
or
four
warriors
with
all
their
rifles
and
the
want
of
which
had
alone
prevented
their
crossing
the
river
by
swimming
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
in
this
manner
the
body
of
friends
and
foes
united
reached
the
margin
of
the
eastern
channel
where
as
in
the
case
of
the
western
the
river
was
too
deep
to
be
waded
here
a
short
pause
succeeded
it
being
necessary
to
determine
the
manner
in
which
the
canoe
was
to
be
carried
across
one
of
the
four
who
had
just
reached
the
boat
was
a
chief
and
the
habitual
deference
which
the
american
indian
pays
to
merit
experience
and
station
kept
the
others
silent
until
this
individual
had
spoken
the
halt
greatly
added
to
the
danger
of
discovering
the
presence
of
jasper
in
particular
who
however
had
the
precaution
to
throw
the
cap
he
wore
into
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
being
without
his
jacket
and
shirt
the
outline
of
his
figure
in
the
obscurity
would
now
be
less
likely
to
attract
observation
his
position
too
at
the
stern
of
the
canoe
a
little
favored
his
concealment
the
iroquois
naturally
keeping
their
looks
directed
the
other
way
not
so
with
chingachgook
this
warrior
was
literally
in
the
midst
of
his
most
deadly
foes
and
he
could
scarcely
move
without
touching
one
of
them
yet
he
was
apparently
unmoved
though
he
kept
all
his
senses
on
the
alert
in
readiness
to
escape
or
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
proper
moment
by
carefully
abstaining
from
looking
towards
those
behind
him
he
lessened
the
chances
of
discovery
and
waited
with
the
indomitable
patience
of
an
indian
for
the
instant
when
he
should
be
required
to
act
let
all
my
young
men
but
two
one
at
each
end
of
the
canoe
cross
and
get
their
arms
said
the
iroquois
chief
let
the
two
push
over
the
the
indians
quietly
obeyed
leaving
jasper
at
the
stern
and
the
iroquois
who
had
found
the
canoe
at
the
bow
of
the
light
craft
chingachgook
burying
himself
so
deep
in
the
river
as
to
be
passed
by
the
others
without
detection
the
splashing
in
the
water
the
tossing
arms
and
the
calls
of
one
to
another
soon
announced
that
the
four
who
had
last
joined
the
party
were
already
swimming
as
soon
as
this
fact
was
certain
the
delaware
rose
resumed
his
former
station
and
began
to
think
the
moment
for
action
was
come
one
less
habitually
under
than
this
warrior
would
probably
have
now
aimed
his
meditated
blow
but
chingachgook
knew
there
were
more
iroquois
behind
him
on
the
rift
and
he
was
a
warrior
much
too
trained
and
experienced
to
risk
anything
unnecessarily
he
suffered
the
indian
at
the
bow
of
the
canoe
to
push
off
into
the
deep
water
and
then
all
three
were
swimming
in
the
direction
of
the
eastern
shore
instead
however
of
helping
the
canoe
across
the
swift
current
no
sooner
did
the
delaware
and
jasper
find
themselves
within
the
influence
of
its
greatest
force
than
both
began
to
swim
in
a
way
to
check
their
farther
progress
across
the
stream
nor
was
this
done
suddenly
or
in
the
incautious
manner
in
which
a
civilized
man
would
have
been
apt
to
attempt
the
artifice
but
warily
and
so
gradually
that
the
iroquois
at
the
bow
fancied
at
first
he
was
merely
struggling
against
the
strength
of
the
current
of
course
while
acted
on
by
these
opposing
efforts
the
canoe
drifted
down
stream
and
in
about
a
minute
it
was
floating
in
still
deeper
water
at
the
foot
of
the
rift
here
however
the
iroquois
was
not
slow
in
finding
that
something
unusual
retarded
their
advance
and
looking
back
he
first
learned
that
he
was
resisted
by
the
efforts
of
his
companions
that
second
nature
which
grows
up
through
habit
instantly
told
the
young
iroquois
that
he
was
alone
with
enemies
dashing
the
water
aside
he
sprang
at
the
throat
of
chingachgook
and
the
two
indians
relinquishing
their
hold
of
the
canoe
seized
each
other
like
tigers
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
of
that
gloomy
night
and
floating
in
an
element
so
dangerous
to
man
when
engaged
in
deadly
strife
they
appeared
to
forget
everything
but
their
fell
animosity
and
their
mutual
desire
to
conquer
jasper
had
now
complete
command
of
the
canoe
which
flew
off
like
a
feather
impelled
by
the
breath
under
the
violent
reaction
of
the
struggles
of
the
two
combatants
the
first
impulse
of
the
youth
was
to
swim
to
the
aid
of
the
delaware
but
the
importance
of
securing
the
boat
presented
itself
with
tenfold
force
while
he
listened
to
the
heavy
breathings
of
the
warriors
as
they
throttled
each
other
and
he
proceeded
as
fast
as
possible
towards
the
western
shore
this
he
soon
reached
and
after
a
short
search
he
succeeded
in
discovering
the
remainder
of
the
party
and
in
procuring
his
clothes
a
few
words
sufficed
to
explain
the
situation
in
which
he
had
left
the
delaware
and
the
manner
in
which
the
canoe
had
been
obtained
when
those
who
had
been
left
behind
had
heard
the
explanations
of
jasper
a
profound
stillness
reigned
among
them
each
listening
intently
in
the
vain
hope
of
catching
some
clue
to
the
result
of
the
fearful
struggle
that
had
just
taken
place
if
it
were
not
still
going
on
in
the
water
nothing
was
audible
beyond
the
steady
roar
of
the
rushing
river
it
being
a
part
of
the
policy
of
their
enemies
on
the
opposite
shore
to
observe
the
most
deathlike
stillness
take
this
paddle
jasper
said
pathfinder
calmly
though
the
listeners
thought
his
voice
sounded
more
melancholy
than
usual
and
follow
with
your
own
canoe
it
is
unsafe
for
us
to
remain
here
but
the
serpent
the
great
sarpent
is
in
the
hands
of
his
own
deity
and
will
live
or
die
according
to
the
intentions
of
providence
we
can
do
him
no
good
and
may
risk
too
much
by
remaining
here
in
idleness
like
women
talking
over
their
distresses
this
darkness
is
very
a
loud
long
piercing
yell
came
from
the
shore
and
cut
short
the
words
of
the
guide
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
uproar
master
pathfinder
demanded
cap
it
sounds
more
like
the
outcries
of
devils
than
anything
that
can
come
from
the
throats
of
christians
and
christians
they
are
not
and
do
not
pretend
to
be
and
do
not
wish
to
be
and
in
calling
them
devils
you
have
scarcely
misnamed
them
that
yell
is
one
of
rejoicing
and
it
is
as
conquerors
they
have
given
it
the
body
of
the
sarpent
no
doubt
dead
or
alive
is
in
their
power
and
we
exclaimed
jasper
who
felt
a
pang
of
generous
regret
as
the
idea
that
he
might
have
averted
the
calamity
presented
itself
to
his
mind
had
he
not
deserted
his
comrade
we
can
do
the
chief
no
good
lad
and
must
quit
this
spot
as
fast
as
without
one
attempt
to
rescue
him
without
even
knowing
whether
he
be
dead
or
living
jasper
is
right
said
mabel
who
could
speak
though
her
voice
sounded
huskily
and
smothered
i
have
no
fears
uncle
and
will
stay
here
until
we
know
what
has
become
of
our
this
seems
reasonable
pathfinder
put
in
cap
your
true
seaman
can
not
well
desert
a
messmate
and
i
am
glad
to
find
that
motives
so
correct
exist
among
those
tut
tut
returned
the
impatient
guide
forcing
the
canoe
into
the
stream
as
he
spoke
ye
know
nothing
and
ye
fear
nothing
if
ye
value
your
lives
think
of
reaching
the
garrison
and
leave
the
delaware
in
the
hands
of
providence
ah
me
the
deer
that
goes
too
often
to
the
lick
meets
the
hunter
at
last
chapter
vii
and
is
this
yarrow
this
the
stream
of
which
my
fancy
so
faithfully
a
waking
dream
an
image
that
hath
perish
oh
that
some
minstrel
harp
were
near
to
utter
notes
of
gladness
and
chase
this
silence
from
the
air
that
fills
my
heart
with
sadness
wordsworth
the
scene
was
not
without
its
sublimity
and
the
ardent
mabel
felt
her
blood
thrill
in
her
veins
and
her
cheeks
flush
as
the
canoe
shot
into
the
strength
of
the
stream
to
quit
the
spot
the
darkness
of
the
night
had
lessened
by
the
dispersion
of
the
clouds
but
the
overhanging
woods
rendered
the
shore
so
obscure
that
the
boats
floated
down
the
current
in
a
belt
of
gloom
that
effectually
secured
them
from
detection
still
there
was
necessarily
a
strong
feeling
of
insecurity
in
all
on
board
them
and
even
jasper
who
by
this
time
began
to
tremble
in
behalf
of
the
girl
at
every
unusual
sound
that
arose
from
the
forest
kept
casting
uneasy
glances
around
him
as
he
drifted
on
in
company
the
paddle
was
used
lightly
and
only
with
exceeding
care
for
the
slightest
sound
in
the
breathing
stillness
of
that
hour
and
place
might
apprise
the
watchful
ears
of
the
iroquois
of
their
position
all
these
accessories
added
to
the
impressive
grandeur
of
her
situation
and
contributed
to
render
the
moment
much
the
most
exciting
which
had
ever
occurred
in
the
brief
existence
of
mabel
dunham
spirited
accustomed
to
and
sustained
by
the
pride
of
considering
herself
a
soldier
daughter
she
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
under
the
influence
of
fear
yet
her
heart
often
beat
quicker
than
common
her
fine
blue
eye
lighted
with
an
exhibition
of
a
resolution
that
was
wasted
in
the
darkness
and
her
quickened
feelings
came
in
aid
of
the
real
sublimity
that
belonged
to
the
scene
and
to
the
incidents
of
the
night
mabel
said
the
suppressed
voice
of
jasper
as
the
two
canoes
floated
so
near
each
other
that
the
hand
of
the
young
man
held
them
together
you
have
no
dread
you
trust
freely
to
our
care
and
willingness
to
protect
you
i
am
a
soldier
daughter
as
you
know
jasper
western
and
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
confess
rely
on
me
on
us
all
your
uncle
pathfinder
the
delaware
were
the
poor
fellow
here
i
myself
will
risk
everything
rather
than
harm
should
reach
i
believe
you
jasper
returned
the
girl
her
hand
unconsciously
playing
in
the
water
i
know
that
my
uncle
loves
me
and
will
never
think
of
himself
until
he
has
first
thought
of
me
and
i
believe
you
are
all
my
father
friends
and
would
willingly
assist
his
child
but
i
am
not
so
feeble
and
as
you
may
think
for
though
only
a
girl
from
the
towns
and
like
most
of
that
class
a
little
disposed
to
see
danger
where
there
is
none
i
promise
you
jasper
no
foolish
fears
of
mine
shall
stand
in
the
way
of
your
doing
your
the
sergeant
daughter
is
right
and
she
is
worthy
of
being
honest
thomas
dunham
child
put
in
the
pathfinder
ah
me
pretty
one
many
is
the
time
that
your
father
and
i
have
scouted
and
marched
together
on
the
flanks
and
rear
of
the
enemy
in
nights
darker
than
this
and
that
too
when
we
did
not
know
but
the
next
moment
would
lead
us
into
a
bloody
ambushment
i
was
at
his
side
when
he
got
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
and
the
honest
fellow
will
tell
you
when
you
meet
the
manner
in
which
we
contrived
to
cross
the
river
which
lay
in
our
rear
in
order
to
save
his
he
has
told
me
said
mabel
with
more
energy
perhaps
than
her
situation
rendered
prudent
i
have
his
letters
in
which
he
has
mentioned
all
that
and
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
the
service
god
will
remember
it
pathfinder
and
there
is
no
gratitude
that
you
can
ask
of
the
daughter
which
she
will
not
cheerfully
repay
for
her
father
ay
that
is
the
way
with
all
your
gentle
and
creatures
i
have
seen
some
of
you
before
and
have
heard
of
others
the
sergeant
himself
has
talked
to
me
of
his
own
young
days
and
of
your
mother
and
of
the
manner
in
which
he
courted
her
and
of
all
the
crossings
and
disappointments
until
he
succeeded
at
my
mother
did
not
live
long
to
repay
him
for
what
he
did
to
win
her
said
mabel
with
a
trembling
lip
so
he
tells
me
the
honest
sergeant
has
kept
nothing
back
for
being
so
many
years
my
senior
he
has
looked
on
me
in
our
many
scoutings
together
as
a
sort
of
perhaps
pathfinder
observed
jasper
with
a
huskiness
in
his
voice
that
defeated
the
attempt
at
pleasantry
he
would
be
glad
to
have
you
for
one
in
and
if
he
did
where
would
be
the
sin
of
it
he
knows
what
i
am
on
a
trail
or
a
scout
and
he
has
seen
me
often
face
to
face
with
the
frenchers
i
have
sometimes
thought
lad
that
we
all
ought
to
seek
for
wives
for
the
man
that
lives
altogether
in
the
woods
and
in
company
with
his
enemies
or
his
prey
gets
to
lose
some
of
the
feeling
of
kind
in
the
end
it
is
not
easy
to
dwell
always
in
the
presence
of
god
and
not
feel
the
power
of
his
goodness
i
have
attended
in
the
garrisons
and
tried
hard
as
becomes
a
true
soldier
to
join
in
the
prayers
for
though
no
enlisted
sarvant
of
the
king
i
fight
his
battles
and
sarve
his
cause
and
so
i
have
endeavored
to
worship
but
never
could
raise
within
me
the
solemn
feelings
and
true
affection
that
i
feel
when
alone
with
god
in
the
forest
there
i
seem
to
stand
face
to
face
with
my
master
all
around
me
is
fresh
and
beautiful
as
it
came
from
his
hand
and
there
is
no
nicety
or
doctrine
to
chill
the
feelings
no
no
the
woods
are
the
true
temple
after
all
for
there
the
thoughts
are
free
to
mount
higher
even
than
the
you
speak
the
truth
master
pathfinder
said
cap
and
a
truth
that
all
who
live
much
in
solitude
know
what
for
instance
is
the
reason
that
seafaring
men
in
general
are
so
religious
and
conscientious
in
all
they
do
but
the
fact
that
they
are
so
often
alone
with
providence
and
have
so
little
to
do
with
the
wickedness
of
the
land
many
and
many
is
the
time
that
i
have
stood
my
watch
under
the
equator
perhaps
or
in
the
southern
ocean
when
the
nights
are
lighted
up
with
the
fires
of
heaven
and
that
is
the
time
i
can
tell
you
my
hearties
to
bring
a
man
to
his
bearings
in
the
way
of
his
sins
i
have
rattled
down
mine
again
and
again
under
such
circumstances
until
the
shrouds
and
lanyards
of
conscience
have
fairly
creaked
with
the
strain
i
agree
with
you
master
pathfinder
therefore
in
saying
if
you
want
a
truly
religious
man
go
to
sea
or
go
into
the
uncle
i
thought
seamen
had
little
credit
generally
for
their
respect
for
religion
all
d
d
slander
girl
for
all
the
essentials
of
christianity
the
seaman
beats
the
landsman
i
will
not
answer
for
all
this
master
cap
returned
pathfinder
but
i
daresay
some
of
it
may
be
true
i
want
no
thunder
and
lightning
to
remind
me
of
my
god
nor
am
i
as
apt
to
bethink
on
most
of
all
his
goodness
in
trouble
and
tribulations
as
on
a
calm
solemn
quiet
day
in
a
forest
when
his
voice
is
heard
in
the
creaking
of
a
dead
branch
or
in
the
song
of
a
bird
as
much
in
my
ears
at
least
as
it
is
ever
heard
in
uproar
and
gales
how
is
it
with
you
you
face
the
tempests
as
well
as
master
cap
and
ought
to
know
something
of
the
feelings
of
i
fear
that
i
am
too
young
and
too
inexperienced
to
be
able
to
say
much
on
such
a
subject
modestly
answered
jasper
but
you
have
your
feelings
said
mabel
quickly
you
can
not
no
one
can
live
among
such
scenes
without
feeling
how
much
they
ought
to
trust
in
god
i
shall
not
belie
my
training
so
much
as
to
say
i
do
not
sometimes
think
of
these
things
but
i
fear
it
is
not
so
often
or
so
much
as
i
fresh
water
resumed
cap
pithily
you
are
not
to
expect
too
much
of
the
young
man
mabel
i
think
they
call
you
sometimes
by
a
name
which
would
insinuate
all
this
is
it
not
quietly
replied
jasper
who
from
sailing
on
the
lake
had
acquired
a
knowledge
of
french
as
well
as
of
several
of
the
indian
dialects
it
is
a
name
the
iroquois
have
given
me
to
distinguish
me
from
some
of
my
companions
who
once
sailed
upon
the
sea
and
are
fond
of
filling
the
ears
of
the
natives
with
stories
of
their
great
and
why
should
they
i
daresay
they
do
the
savages
no
harm
ay
ay
that
must
mean
the
white
brandy
which
may
well
enough
be
called
the
deuce
for
deuced
stuff
it
is
the
signification
of
is
and
it
is
the
manner
in
which
the
french
express
rejoined
jasper
a
little
nettled
and
how
the
devil
do
they
make
water
out
of
when
it
means
brandy
in
besides
among
seamen
eau
always
means
brandy
and
brandy
of
a
high
proof
i
think
nothing
of
your
ignorance
young
man
for
it
is
natural
to
your
situation
and
can
not
be
helped
if
you
will
return
with
me
and
make
a
or
two
on
the
atlantic
it
will
serve
you
a
good
turn
the
remainder
of
your
days
and
mabel
there
and
all
the
other
young
women
near
the
coast
will
think
all
the
better
of
you
should
you
live
to
be
as
old
as
one
of
the
trees
in
this
nay
nay
interrupted
the
and
generous
guide
jasper
wants
not
for
friends
in
this
region
i
can
assure
you
and
though
seeing
the
world
according
to
his
habits
may
do
him
good
as
well
as
another
we
shall
think
none
the
worse
of
him
if
he
never
quits
us
or
he
is
a
brave
youth
and
i
always
sleep
as
soundly
when
he
is
on
the
watch
as
if
i
was
up
and
stirring
myself
ay
and
for
that
matter
sounder
too
the
sergeant
daughter
here
does
believe
it
necessary
for
the
lad
to
go
to
sea
in
order
to
make
a
man
of
him
or
one
who
is
worthy
to
be
respected
and
mabel
made
no
reply
to
this
appeal
and
she
even
looked
towards
the
western
shore
although
the
darkness
rendered
the
natural
movements
unnecessary
to
conceal
her
face
but
jasper
felt
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
his
saying
something
the
pride
of
youth
and
manhood
revolting
at
the
idea
of
his
being
in
a
condition
not
to
command
the
respect
of
his
fellows
or
the
smiles
of
his
equals
of
the
other
sex
still
he
was
unwilling
to
utter
aught
that
might
be
considered
harsh
to
the
uncle
of
mabel
and
his
was
perhaps
more
creditable
than
his
modesty
and
spirit
i
pretend
not
to
things
i
do
possess
he
said
and
lay
no
claim
to
any
knowledge
of
the
ocean
or
of
navigation
we
steer
by
the
stars
and
the
compass
on
these
lakes
running
from
headland
to
headland
and
having
little
need
of
figures
and
calculations
make
no
use
of
them
but
we
have
our
claims
notwithstanding
as
i
have
often
heard
from
those
who
have
passed
years
on
the
ocean
in
the
first
place
we
have
always
the
land
aboard
and
much
of
the
time
on
a
and
that
i
have
frequently
heard
makes
hardy
sailors
our
gales
are
sudden
and
severe
and
we
are
compelled
to
run
for
our
ports
at
all
you
have
your
leads
interrupted
cap
they
are
of
little
use
and
are
seldom
the
i
have
heard
of
such
things
but
confess
i
never
saw
oh
deuce
with
a
vengeance
a
trader
and
no
why
boy
you
can
not
pretend
to
be
anything
of
a
mariner
who
the
devil
ever
heard
of
a
seaman
without
his
i
do
not
pretend
to
any
particular
skill
master
except
in
shooting
falls
jasper
except
in
shooting
falls
and
rifts
said
pathfinder
coming
to
the
rescue
in
which
business
even
you
master
cap
must
allow
he
has
some
handiness
in
my
judgment
every
man
is
to
be
esteemed
or
condemned
according
to
his
gifts
and
if
master
cap
is
useless
in
running
the
oswego
falls
i
try
to
remember
that
he
is
useful
when
out
of
sight
of
land
and
if
jasper
be
useless
when
out
of
sight
of
land
i
do
not
forget
that
he
has
a
true
eye
and
steady
hand
when
running
the
but
jasper
is
not
useless
would
not
be
useless
when
out
of
sight
of
land
said
mabel
with
a
spirit
and
energy
that
caused
her
clear
sweet
voice
to
be
startling
amid
the
solemn
stillness
of
that
extraordinary
scene
no
one
can
be
useless
there
who
can
do
so
much
here
is
what
i
mean
though
i
daresay
he
is
not
as
well
acquainted
with
ships
as
my
ay
bolster
each
other
up
in
your
ignorance
returned
cap
with
a
sneer
we
seamen
are
so
much
when
ashore
that
it
is
seldom
we
get
our
dues
but
when
you
want
to
be
defended
or
trade
is
to
be
carried
on
there
is
outcry
enough
for
but
uncle
landsmen
do
not
come
to
attack
our
coasts
so
that
seamen
only
meet
so
much
for
ignorance
where
are
all
the
enemies
that
have
landed
in
this
country
french
and
english
let
me
inquire
niece
sure
enough
where
are
they
ejaculated
pathfinder
none
can
tell
better
than
we
who
dwell
in
the
woods
master
cap
i
have
often
followed
their
line
of
march
by
bones
bleaching
in
the
rain
and
have
found
their
trail
by
graves
years
after
they
and
their
pride
had
vanished
together
generals
and
privates
they
lay
scattered
throughout
the
land
so
many
proofs
of
what
men
are
when
led
on
by
their
love
of
great
names
and
the
wish
to
be
more
than
their
i
must
say
master
pathfinder
that
you
sometimes
utter
opinions
that
are
a
little
remarkable
for
a
man
who
lives
by
the
rifle
seldom
snuffing
the
air
but
he
smells
gunpowder
or
turning
out
of
his
berth
but
to
bear
down
on
an
if
you
think
i
pass
my
days
in
warfare
against
my
kind
you
know
neither
me
nor
my
history
the
man
that
lives
in
the
woods
and
on
the
frontiers
must
take
the
chances
of
the
things
among
which
he
dwells
for
this
i
am
not
accountable
being
but
an
humble
and
powerless
hunter
and
scout
and
guide
my
real
calling
is
to
hunt
for
the
army
on
its
marches
and
in
times
of
peace
although
i
am
more
especially
engaged
in
the
service
of
one
officer
who
is
now
absent
in
the
settlements
where
i
never
follow
him
no
no
bloodshed
and
warfare
are
not
my
real
gifts
but
peace
and
mercy
still
i
must
face
the
enemy
as
well
as
another
and
as
for
a
mingo
i
look
upon
him
as
man
looks
on
a
snake
a
to
be
put
beneath
the
heel
whenever
a
fitting
occasion
well
well
i
have
mistaken
your
calling
which
i
had
thought
as
regularly
warlike
as
that
of
a
ship
gunner
there
is
my
now
he
has
been
a
soldier
since
he
was
sixteen
and
he
looks
upon
his
trade
as
every
way
as
respectable
as
that
of
a
seafaring
man
a
point
i
hardly
think
it
worth
while
to
dispute
with
my
father
has
been
taught
to
believe
that
it
is
honorable
to
carry
arms
said
mabel
for
his
father
was
a
soldier
before
yes
yes
resumed
the
guide
most
of
the
sergeant
gifts
are
martial
and
he
looks
at
most
things
in
this
world
over
the
barrel
of
his
musket
one
of
his
notions
now
is
to
prefer
a
king
piece
to
a
regular
rifle
such
conceits
will
come
over
men
from
long
habit
and
prejudice
is
perhaps
the
commonest
failing
of
human
while
the
desultory
conversation
just
related
had
been
carried
on
in
subdued
voices
the
canoes
were
dropping
slowly
down
with
the
current
within
the
deep
shadows
of
the
western
shore
the
paddles
being
used
merely
to
preserve
the
desired
direction
and
proper
positions
the
strength
of
the
stream
varied
materially
the
water
being
seemingly
still
in
places
while
in
other
reaches
it
flowed
at
a
rate
exceeding
two
or
even
three
miles
in
the
hour
on
the
rifts
it
even
dashed
forward
with
a
velocity
that
was
appalling
to
the
unpractised
eye
jasper
was
of
opinion
that
they
might
drift
down
with
the
current
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
two
hours
from
the
time
they
left
the
shore
and
he
and
the
pathfinder
had
agreed
on
the
expediency
of
suffering
the
canoes
to
float
of
themselves
for
a
time
or
at
least
until
they
had
passed
the
first
dangers
of
their
new
movement
the
dialogue
had
been
carried
on
in
voices
too
guardedly
low
for
though
the
quiet
of
deep
solitude
reigned
in
that
vast
and
nearly
boundless
forest
nature
was
speaking
with
her
thousand
tongues
in
the
eloquent
language
of
night
in
a
wilderness
the
air
sighed
through
ten
thousand
trees
the
water
rippled
and
at
places
even
roared
along
the
shores
and
now
and
then
was
heard
the
creaking
of
a
branch
or
a
trunk
as
it
rubbed
against
some
object
similar
to
itself
under
the
vibrations
of
a
nicely
balanced
body
all
living
sounds
had
ceased
once
it
is
true
the
pathfinder
fancied
he
heard
the
howl
of
a
distant
wolf
of
which
a
few
prowled
through
these
woods
but
it
was
a
transient
and
doubtful
cry
that
might
possibly
have
been
attributed
to
the
imagination
when
he
desired
his
companions
however
to
cease
talking
his
vigilant
ear
had
caught
the
peculiar
sound
which
is
made
by
the
parting
of
a
dried
branch
of
a
tree
and
which
if
his
senses
did
not
deceive
him
came
from
the
western
shore
all
who
are
accustomed
to
that
particular
sound
will
understand
how
readily
the
ear
receives
it
and
how
easy
it
is
to
distinguish
the
tread
which
breaks
the
branch
from
every
other
noise
of
the
forest
there
is
the
footstep
of
a
man
on
the

said
pathfinder
to
jasper
speaking
in
neither
a
whisper
nor
yet
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
at
any
distance
can
the
accursed
iroquois
have
crossed
the
river
already
with
their
arms
and
without
a
boat
it
may
be
the
delaware
he
would
follow
us
of
course
down
this
bank
and
would
know
where
to
look
for
us
let
me
draw
closer
into
the
shore
and
go
boy
but
be
light
with
the
paddle
and
on
no
account
venture
ashore
on
an
is
this
prudent
demanded
mabel
with
an
impetuosity
that
rendered
her
incautious
in
modulating
her
sweet
voice
very
imprudent
if
you
speak
so
loud
fair
one
i
like
your
voice
which
is
soft
and
pleasing
after
the
listening
so
long
to
the
tones
of
men
but
it
must
not
be
heard
too
much
or
too
freely
just
now
your
father
the
honest
sergeant
will
tell
you
when
you
meet
him
that
silence
is
a
double
virtue
on
a
trail
go
jasper
and
do
justice
to
your
own
character
for
ten
anxious
minutes
succeeded
the
disappearance
of
the
canoe
of
jasper
which
glided
away
from
that
of
the
pathfinder
so
noiselessly
that
it
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
gloom
before
mabel
allowed
herself
to
believe
the
young
man
would
really
venture
alone
on
a
service
which
struck
her
imagination
as
singularly
dangerous
during
this
time
the
party
continued
to
float
with
the
current
no
one
speaking
and
it
might
almost
be
said
no
one
breathing
so
strong
was
the
general
desire
to
catch
the
minutest
sound
that
should
come
from
the
shore
but
the
same
solemn
we
might
indeed
say
sublime
quiet
reigned
as
before
the
washing
of
the
water
as
it
piled
up
against
some
slight
obstruction
and
the
sighing
of
the
trees
alone
interrupting
the
slumbers
of
the
forest
at
the
end
of
the
period
mentioned
the
snapping
of
dried
branches
was
again
faintly
heard
and
the
pathfinder
fancied
that
the
sound
of
smothered
voices
reached
him
i
may
be
mistaken
he
said
for
the
thoughts
often
fancy
what
the
heart
wishes
but
these
were
notes
like
the
low
tones
of
the
do
the
dead
of
the
savages
ever
walk
demanded
cap
ay
and
run
too
in
their
happy
but
nowhere
else
a
finishes
with
the
after
the
breath
quits
the
body
it
is
not
one
of
his
gifts
to
linger
around
his
wigwam
when
his
hour
has
i
see
some
object
on
the
water
whispered
mabel
whose
eye
had
not
ceased
to
dwell
on
the
body
of
gloom
with
close
intensity
since
the
disappearance
of
jasper
it
is
the
canoe
returned
the
guide
greatly
relieved
all
must
be
safe
or
we
should
have
heard
from
the
in
another
minute
the
two
canoes
which
became
visible
to
those
they
carried
only
as
they
drew
near
each
other
again
floated
side
by
side
and
the
form
of
jasper
was
recognized
at
the
stern
of
his
own
boat
the
figure
of
a
second
man
was
seated
in
the
bow
and
as
the
young
sailor
so
wielded
his
paddle
as
to
bring
the
face
of
his
companion
near
the
eyes
of
the
pathfinder
and
mabel
they
both
recognized
the
person
of
the
delaware
chingachgook
my
brother
said
the
guide
in
the
dialect
of
the
people
a
tremor
shaking
his
voice
that
betrayed
the
strength
of
his
feelings
chief
of
the
mohicans
my
heart
is
very
glad
often
have
we
passed
through
blood
and
strife
together
but
i
was
afraid
it
was
never
to
be
so
hugh
the
mingos
are
squaws
three
of
their
scalps
hang
at
my
girdle
they
do
not
know
how
to
strike
the
great
serpent
of
the
delawares
their
hearts
have
no
blood
and
their
thoughts
are
on
their
return
path
across
the
waters
of
the
great
have
you
been
among
them
chief
and
what
has
become
of
the
warrior
who
was
in
the
river
he
has
turned
into
a
fish
and
lies
at
the
bottom
with
the
eels
let
his
brothers
bait
their
hooks
for
him
pathfinder
i
have
counted
the
enemy
and
have
touched
their
ah
i
thought
he
would
be
venturesome
exclaimed
the
guide
in
english
the
risky
fellow
has
been
in
the
midst
of
them
and
has
brought
us
back
their
whole
history
speak
chingachgook
and
i
will
make
our
friends
as
knowing
as
the
delaware
now
related
in
a
low
earnest
manner
the
substance
of
all
his
discoveries
since
he
was
last
seen
struggling
with
his
foe
in
the
river
of
the
fate
of
his
antagonist
he
said
no
more
it
not
being
usual
for
a
warrior
to
boast
in
his
more
direct
and
useful
narratives
as
soon
as
he
had
conquered
in
that
fearful
strife
however
he
swam
to
the
eastern
shore
landed
with
caution
and
wound
his
way
in
amongst
the
iroquois
concealed
by
the
darkness
undetected
and
in
the
main
even
unsuspected
once
indeed
he
had
been
questioned
but
answering
that
he
was
arrowhead
no
further
inquiries
were
made
by
the
passing
remarks
he
soon
ascertained
that
the
party
was
out
expressly
to
intercept
mabel
and
her
uncle
concerning
whose
rank
however
they
had
evidently
been
deceived
he
also
ascertained
enough
to
justify
the
suspicion
that
arrowhead
had
betrayed
them
to
their
enemies
for
some
motive
that
it
was
not
now
easy
to
reach
as
he
had
not
yet
received
the
reward
of
his
services
pathfinder
communicated
no
more
of
this
intelligence
to
his
companions
than
he
thought
might
relieve
their
apprehensions
intimating
at
the
same
time
that
now
was
the
moment
for
exertion
the
iroquois
not
having
yet
entirely
recovered
from
the
confusion
created
by
their
losses
we
shall
find
them
at
the
rift
i
make
no
manner
of
doubt
continued
he
and
there
it
will
be
our
fate
to
pass
them
or
to
fall
into
their
hands
the
distance
to
the
garrison
will
then
be
so
short
that
i
have
been
thinking
of
a
plan
of
landing
with
mabel
myself
that
i
may
take
her
in
by
some
of
the
and
leave
the
canoes
to
their
chances
in
the
it
will
never
succeed
pathfinder
eagerly
interrupted
jasper
mabel
is
not
strong
enough
to
tramp
the
woods
in
a
night
like
this
put
her
in
my
skiff
and
i
will
lose
my
life
or
carry
her
through
the
rift
safely
dark
as
it
no
doubt
you
will
lad
no
one
doubts
your
willingness
to
do
anything
to
serve
the
sergeant
daughter
but
it
must
be
the
eye
of
providence
and
not
your
own
that
will
take
you
safely
through
the
oswego
rift
in
a
night
like
and
who
will
lead
her
safely
to
the
garrison
if
she
land
is
not
the
night
as
dark
on
shore
as
on
the
water
or
do
you
think
i
know
less
of
my
calling
than
you
know
of
yours
spiritedly
said
lad
but
if
i
should
lose
my
way
in
the
dark
and
i
believe
no
man
can
say
truly
that
such
a
thing
ever
yet
happened
to
me
but
if
i
lose
my
way
no
other
harm
would
come
of
it
than
to
pass
a
night
in
the
forest
whereas
a
false
turn
of
the
paddle
or
a
broad
sheer
of
the
canoe
would
put
you
and
the
young
woman
into
the
river
out
of
which
it
is
more
than
probable
the
sergeant
daughter
would
never
come
i
will
leave
it
to
mabel
herself
i
am
certain
that
she
will
feel
more
secure
in
the
i
have
great
confidence
in
you
both
answered
the
girl
and
have
no
doubts
that
either
will
do
all
he
can
to
prove
to
my
father
how
much
he
values
him
but
i
confess
i
should
not
like
to
quit
the
canoe
with
the
certainty
we
have
of
there
being
enemies
like
those
we
have
seen
in
the
forest
but
my
uncle
can
decide
for
me
in
this
i
have
no
liking
for
the
woods
said
cap
while
one
has
a
clear
drift
like
this
on
the
river
besides
master
pathfinder
to
say
nothing
of
the
savages
you
overlook
the
sharks
who
ever
heard
of
sharks
in
the
wilderness
ay
sharks
or
bears
or
wolves
no
matter
what
you
call
a
thing
so
it
has
the
mind
and
power
to
lord
lord
man
do
you
dread
any
creatur
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
american
forest
a
catamount
is
a
skeary
animal
i
will
allow
but
then
it
is
nothing
in
the
hands
of
a
practysed
hunter
talk
of
the
mingos
and
their
devilries
if
you
will
but
do
not
raise
a
false
alarm
about
bears
and
ay
ay
master
pathfinder
this
is
all
well
enough
for
you
who
probably
know
the
name
of
every
creature
you
would
meet
use
is
everything
and
it
makes
a
man
bold
when
he
might
otherwise
be
bashful
i
have
known
seamen
in
the
low
latitudes
swim
for
hours
at
a
time
among
sharks
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
this
is
extraordinary
exclaimed
jasper
who
had
not
yet
acquired
that
material
part
of
his
trade
the
ability
to
spin
a
yarn
i
have
always
heard
that
it
was
certain
death
to
venture
in
the
water
among
i
forgot
to
say
that
the
lads
always
took
or
handspikes
or
crows
with
them
to
rap
the
beasts
over
the
noses
if
they
got
to
be
troublesome
no
no
i
have
no
liking
for
bears
and
wolves
though
a
whale
in
my
eye
is
very
much
the
same
sort
of
fish
as
a
red
herring
after
it
is
dried
and
salted
mabel
and
i
had
better
stick
to
the
mabel
would
do
well
to
change
canoes
added
jasper
this
of
mine
is
empty
and
even
pathfinder
will
allow
that
my
eye
is
surer
than
his
own
on
the
that
i
will
cheerfully
boy
the
water
belongs
to
your
gifts
and
no
one
will
deny
that
you
have
improved
them
to
the
utmost
you
are
right
enough
in
believing
that
the
sergeant
daughter
will
be
safer
in
your
canoe
than
in
this
and
though
i
would
gladly
keep
her
near
myself
i
have
her
welfare
too
much
at
heart
not
to
give
her
honest
advice
bring
your
canoe
close
alongside
jasper
and
i
will
give
you
what
you
must
consider
as
a
precious
i
do
so
consider
it
returned
the
youth
not
losing
a
moment
in
complying
with
the
request
when
mabel
passed
from
one
canoe
to
the
other
taking
her
seat
on
the
effects
which
had
hitherto
composed
its
sole
cargo
as
soon
as
this
arrangement
was
made
the
canoes
separated
a
short
distance
and
the
paddles
were
used
though
with
great
care
to
avoid
making
any
noise
the
conversation
gradually
ceased
and
as
the
dreaded
rift
was
approached
all
became
impressed
with
the
gravity
of
the
moment
that
their
enemies
would
endeavor
to
reach
this
point
before
them
was
almost
certain
and
it
seemed
so
little
probable
any
one
should
attempt
to
pass
it
in
the
profound
obscurity
which
reigned
that
pathfinder
was
confident
parties
were
on
both
sides
of
the
river
in
the
hope
of
intercepting
them
when
they
might
land
he
would
not
have
made
the
proposal
he
did
had
he
not
felt
sure
of
his
own
ability
to
convert
this
very
anticipation
of
success
into
a
means
of
defeating
the
plans
of
the
iroquois
as
the
arrangement
now
stood
however
everything
depended
on
the
skill
of
those
who
guided
the
canoes
for
should
either
hit
a
rock
if
not
split
asunder
it
would
almost
certainly
be
upset
and
then
would
come
not
only
all
the
hazards
of
the
river
itself
but
for
mabel
the
certainty
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
her
pursuers
the
utmost
circumspection
consequently
became
necessary
and
each
one
was
too
much
engrossed
with
his
own
thoughts
to
feel
a
disposition
to
utter
more
than
was
called
for
by
the
exigencies
of
the
case
at
the
canoes
stole
silently
along
the
roar
of
the
rift
became
audible
and
it
required
all
the
fortitude
of
cap
to
keep
his
seat
while
these
boding
sounds
were
approached
amid
a
darkness
which
scarcely
permitted
a
view
of
the
outlines
of
the
wooded
shore
and
of
the
gloomy
vault
above
his
head
he
retained
a
vivid
impression
of
the
falls
and
his
imagination
was
not
now
idle
in
swelling
the
dangers
of
the
rift
to
a
level
with
those
of
the
headlong
descent
he
had
that
day
made
and
even
to
increase
them
under
the
influence
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
in
this
however
the
old
mariner
was
mistaken
for
the
oswego
rift
and
the
oswego
falls
are
very
different
in
their
characters
and
violence
the
former
being
no
more
than
a
rapid
that
glances
among
shallows
and
rocks
while
the
latter
really
deserved
the
name
it
bore
as
has
been
already
shown
mabel
certainly
felt
distrust
and
apprehension
but
her
entire
situation
was
so
novel
and
her
reliance
on
her
guide
so
great
that
she
retained
a
which
might
not
have
existed
had
she
clearer
perceptions
of
the
truth
or
been
better
acquainted
with
the
helplessness
of
men
when
placed
in
opposition
to
the
power
and
majesty
of
nature
is
that
the
spot
you
have
mentioned
she
said
to
jasper
when
the
roar
of
the
rift
first
came
distinctly
on
her
ears
it
is
and
i
beg
you
to
have
confidence
in
me
we
are
not
old
acquaintances
mabel
but
we
live
many
days
in
one
in
this
wilderness
i
think
already
that
i
have
known
you
years
and
i
do
not
feel
as
if
you
were
a
stranger
to
me
jasper
i
have
every
reliance
on
your
skill
as
well
as
on
your
disposition
to
serve
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
pathfinder
is
striking
the
rapids
too
near
the
centre
of
the
river
the
bed
of
the
water
is
closer
to
the
eastern
shore
but
i
can
not
make
him
hear
me
now
hold
firmly
to
the
canoe
mabel
and
fear
at
the
next
moment
the
swift
current
had
sucked
them
into
the
rift
and
for
three
or
four
minutes
the
rather
than
the
alarmed
girl
saw
nothing
around
her
but
sheets
of
glancing
foam
heard
nothing
but
the
roar
of
waters
twenty
times
did
the
canoe
appear
about
to
dash
against
some
curling
and
bright
wave
that
showed
itself
even
amid
that
obscurity
and
as
often
did
it
glide
away
again
unharmed
impelled
by
the
vigorous
arm
of
him
who
governed
its
movements
once
and
once
only
did
jasper
seem
to
lose
command
of
his
frail
bark
during
which
brief
space
it
fairly
whirled
entirely
round
but
by
a
desperate
effort
he
brought
it
again
under
control
recovered
the
lost
channel
and
was
soon
rewarded
for
all
his
anxiety
by
finding
himself
floating
quietly
in
the
deep
water
below
the
rapids
secure
from
every
danger
and
without
having
taken
in
enough
of
the
element
to
serve
for
a
draught
all
is
over
mabel
the
young
man
cried
cheerfully
the
danger
is
past
and
you
may
now
indeed
hope
to
meet
your
father
this
very
god
be
praised
jasper
we
shall
owe
this
great
happiness
to
the
pathfinder
may
claim
a
full
share
in
the
merit
but
what
has
become
of
the
other
canoe
i
see
something
near
us
on
the
water
is
it
not
the
boat
of
our
friends
a
few
strokes
of
the
paddle
brought
jasper
to
the
side
of
the
object
in
question
it
was
the
other
canoe
empty
and
bottom
upwards
no
sooner
did
the
young
man
ascertain
this
fact
than
he
began
to
search
for
the
swimmers
and
to
his
great
joy
cap
was
soon
discovered
drifting
down
with
the
current
the
old
seaman
preferring
the
chances
of
drowning
to
those
of
landing
among
savages
he
was
hauled
into
the
canoe
though
not
without
difficulty
and
then
the
search
ended
for
jasper
was
persuaded
that
the
pathfinder
would
wade
to
the
shore
the
water
being
shallow
in
preference
to
abandoning
his
beloved
rifle
the
remainder
of
the
passage
was
short
though
made
amid
darkness
and
doubt
after
a
short
pause
a
dull
roaring
sound
was
heard
which
at
times
resembled
the
mutterings
of
distant
thunder
and
then
again
brought
with
it
the
washing
of
waters
jasper
announced
to
his
companions
that
they
now
heard
the
surf
of
the
lake
low
curved
spits
of
land
lay
before
them
into
the
bay
formed
by
one
of
which
the
canoe
glided
and
then
it
shot
up
noiselessly
upon
a
gravelly
beach
the
transition
that
followed
was
so
hurried
and
great
that
mabel
scarcely
knew
what
passed
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
however
sentinels
had
been
passed
a
gate
was
opened
and
the
agitated
girl
found
herself
in
the
arms
of
a
parent
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
chapter
viii
a
land
of
love
and
a
land
of
light
withouten
sun
or
moon
or
night
where
the
river
swa
a
living
stream
and
the
light
a
pure
celestial
beam
the
land
of
vision
it
would
seem
a
still
an
everlasting
dream
the
rest
that
succeeds
fatigue
and
which
attends
a
newly
awakened
sense
of
security
is
generally
sweet
and
deep
such
was
the
fact
with
mabel
who
did
not
rise
from
her
humble
pallet
such
a
bed
as
a
daughter
might
claim
in
a
remote
frontier
post
until
long
after
the
garrison
had
obeyed
the
usual
summons
of
the
drums
and
had
assembled
at
the
morning
parade
sergeant
dunham
on
whose
shoulders
fell
the
task
of
attending
to
these
ordinary
and
daily
duties
had
got
through
all
his
morning
avocations
and
was
beginning
to
think
of
his
breakfast
before
his
child
left
her
room
and
came
into
the
fresh
air
equally
bewildered
delighted
and
grateful
at
the
novelty
and
security
of
her
new
situation
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
oswego
was
one
of
the
extreme
frontier
posts
of
the
british
possessions
on
this
continent
it
had
not
been
long
occupied
and
was
garrisoned
by
a
battalion
of
a
regiment
which
had
been
originally
scotch
but
into
which
many
americans
had
been
received
since
its
arrival
in
this
country
all
innovation
that
had
led
the
way
to
mabel
father
filling
the
humble
but
responsible
situation
of
the
oldest
sergeant
a
few
young
officers
also
who
were
natives
of
the
colonies
were
to
be
found
in
the
corps
the
fort
itself
like
most
works
of
that
character
was
better
adapted
to
resist
an
attack
of
savages
than
to
withstand
a
regular
siege
but
the
great
difficulty
of
transporting
heavy
artillery
and
other
necessaries
rendered
the
occurrence
of
the
latter
a
probability
so
remote
as
scarcely
to
enter
into
the
estimate
of
the
engineers
who
had
planned
the
defences
there
were
bastions
of
earth
and
logs
a
dry
ditch
a
stockade
a
parade
of
considerable
extent
and
barracks
of
logs
that
answered
the
double
purpose
of
dwellings
and
fortifications
a
few
light
stood
in
the
area
of
the
fort
ready
to
be
conveyed
to
any
point
where
they
might
be
wanted
and
one
or
two
heavy
iron
guns
looked
out
from
the
summits
of
the
advanced
angles
as
so
many
admonitions
to
the
audacious
to
respect
their
power
when
mabel
quitting
the
convenient
but
comparatively
retired
hut
where
her
father
had
been
permitted
to
place
her
issued
into
the
pure
air
of
the
morning
she
found
herself
at
the
foot
of
a
bastion
which
lay
invitingly
before
her
with
a
promise
of
giving
a
of
all
that
had
been
concealed
in
the
darkness
of
the
preceding
night
tripping
up
the
grassy
ascent
the
as
well
as
girl
found
herself
at
once
on
a
point
where
the
sight
at
a
few
varying
glances
could
take
in
all
the
external
novelties
of
her
new
situation
to
the
southward
lay
the
forest
through
which
she
had
been
journeying
so
many
weary
days
and
which
had
proved
so
full
of
dangers
it
was
separated
from
the
stockade
by
a
belt
of
open
land
that
had
been
principally
cleared
of
its
woods
to
form
the
martial
constructions
around
her
this
glacis
for
such
in
fact
was
its
military
uses
might
have
covered
a
hundred
acres
but
with
it
every
sign
of
civilization
ceased
all
beyond
was
forest
that
dense
interminable
forest
which
mabel
could
now
picture
to
herself
through
her
recollections
with
its
hidden
glassy
lakes
its
dark
rolling
stream
and
its
world
of
nature
turning
from
this
view
our
heroine
felt
her
cheek
fanned
by
a
fresh
and
grateful
breeze
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
since
quitting
the
far
distant
coast
here
a
new
scene
presented
itself
although
expected
it
was
not
without
a
start
and
a
low
exclamation
indicative
of
pleasure
that
the
eager
eyes
of
the
girl
drank
in
its
beauties
to
the
north
and
east
and
west
in
every
direction
in
short
over
one
entire
half
of
the
novel
panorama
lay
a
field
of
rolling
waters
the
element
was
neither
of
that
glassy
green
which
distinguishes
the
american
waters
in
general
nor
yet
of
the
deep
blue
of
the
ocean
the
color
being
of
a
slightly
amber
hue
which
scarcely
affected
its
limpidity
no
land
was
to
be
seen
with
the
exception
of
the
adjacent
coast
which
stretched
to
the
right
and
left
in
an
unbroken
outline
of
forest
with
wide
bays
and
low
headlands
or
points
still
much
of
the
shore
was
rocky
and
into
its
caverns
the
sluggish
waters
occasionally
rolled
producing
a
hollow
sound
which
resembled
the
concussions
of
a
distant
gun
no
sail
whitened
the
surface
no
whale
or
other
fish
gambolled
on
its
bosom
no
sign
of
use
or
service
rewarded
the
longest
and
most
minute
gaze
at
its
boundless
expanse
it
was
a
scene
on
one
side
of
apparently
endless
forests
while
a
waste
of
seemingly
interminable
water
spread
itself
on
the
other
nature
appeared
to
have
delighted
in
producing
grand
effects
by
setting
two
of
her
principal
agents
in
bold
relief
to
each
other
neglecting
details
the
eye
turning
from
the
broad
carpet
of
leaves
to
the
still
broader
field
of
fluid
from
the
endless
but
gentle
heavings
of
the
lake
to
the
holy
calm
and
poetical
solitude
of
the
forest
with
wonder
and
delight
mabel
dunham
though
unsophisticated
like
most
of
her
countrywomen
of
that
period
and
ingenuous
and
frank
as
any
and
girl
well
could
be
was
not
altogether
without
a
feeling
for
the
poetry
of
this
beautiful
earth
of
ours
although
she
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
educated
at
all
for
few
of
her
sex
at
that
day
and
in
this
country
received
much
more
than
the
rudiments
of
plain
english
instruction
still
she
had
been
taught
much
more
than
was
usual
for
young
women
in
her
own
station
in
life
and
in
one
sense
certainly
she
did
credit
to
her
teaching
the
widow
of
a
who
formerly
belonged
to
the
same
regiment
as
her
father
had
taken
the
child
in
charge
at
the
death
of
its
mother
and
under
the
care
of
this
lady
mabel
had
acquired
some
tastes
and
many
ideas
which
otherwise
might
always
have
remained
strangers
to
her
her
situation
in
the
family
had
been
less
that
of
a
domestic
than
of
a
humble
companion
and
the
results
were
quite
apparent
in
her
attire
her
language
her
sentiments
and
even
in
her
feelings
though
neither
perhaps
rose
to
the
level
of
those
which
would
properly
characterize
a
lady
she
had
lost
the
less
refined
habits
and
manners
of
one
in
her
original
position
without
having
quite
reached
a
point
that
disqualified
her
for
the
situation
in
life
that
the
accidents
of
birth
and
fortune
would
probably
compel
her
to
fill
all
else
that
was
distinctive
and
peculiar
in
her
belonged
to
natural
character
with
such
antecedents
it
will
occasion
the
reader
no
wonder
if
he
learns
that
mabel
viewed
the
novel
scene
before
her
with
a
pleasure
far
superior
to
that
produced
by
vulgar
surprise
she
felt
its
ordinary
beauties
as
most
would
have
felt
them
but
she
had
also
a
feeling
for
its
sublimity
for
that
softened
solitude
that
calm
grandeur
and
eloquent
repose
which
ever
pervades
broad
views
of
natural
objects
yet
undisturbed
by
the
labors
and
struggles
of
man
how
beautiful
she
exclaimed
unconscious
of
speaking
as
she
stood
on
the
solitary
bastion
facing
the
air
from
the
lake
and
experiencing
the
genial
influence
of
its
freshness
pervading
both
her
body
and
her
mind
how
very
beautiful
and
yet
how
singular
the
words
and
the
train
of
her
ideas
were
interrupted
by
a
touch
of
a
finger
on
her
shoulder
and
turning
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
father
mabel
found
pathfinder
at
her
side
he
was
leaning
quietly
on
his
long
rifle
and
laughing
in
his
quiet
manner
while
with
an
outstretched
arm
he
swept
over
the
whole
panorama
of
land
and
water
here
you
have
both
our
domains
said
he
jasper
and
mine
the
lake
is
for
him
and
the
woods
are
for
me
the
lad
sometimes
boasts
of
the
breadth
of
his
dominions
but
i
tell
him
my
trees
make
as
broad
a
plain
on
the
face
of
this
as
all
his
water
well
mabel
you
are
fit
for
either
for
i
do
not
see
that
fear
of
the
mingos
or
can
destroy
your
pretty
it
is
a
new
character
for
the
pathfinder
to
appear
in
to
compliment
a
silly
not
silly
mabel
no
not
in
the
least
silly
the
sergeant
daughter
would
do
discredit
to
her
worthy
father
were
she
to
do
or
say
anything
that
could
be
called
then
she
must
take
care
and
not
put
too
much
faith
in
treacherous
flattering
words
but
pathfinder
i
rejoice
to
see
you
among
us
again
for
though
jasper
did
not
seem
to
feel
much
uneasiness
i
was
afraid
some
accident
might
have
happened
to
you
and
your
friend
on
that
frightful
the
lad
knows
us
both
and
was
sartain
that
we
should
not
drown
which
is
scarcely
one
of
my
gifts
it
would
have
been
hard
swimming
of
a
sartainty
with
a
rifle
in
the
hand
and
what
between
the
game
and
the
savages
and
the
french
killdeer
and
i
have
gone
through
too
much
in
company
to
part
very
easily
no
no
we
waded
ashore
the
rift
being
shallow
enough
for
that
with
small
exceptions
and
we
landed
with
our
arms
in
our
hands
we
had
to
take
our
time
for
it
on
account
of
the
iroquois
i
will
own
but
as
soon
as
the
skulking
vagabonds
saw
the
lights
that
the
sergeant
sent
down
to
your
canoe
we
well
understood
they
would
decamp
since
a
visit
might
have
been
expected
from
some
of
the
garrison
so
it
was
only
sitting
patiently
on
the
stones
for
an
hour
and
all
the
danger
was
over
patience
is
the
greatest
of
virtues
in
a
i
rejoice
to
hear
this
for
fatigue
itself
could
scarcely
make
me
sleep
for
thinking
of
what
might
befall
lord
bless
your
tender
little
heart
mabel
but
this
is
the
way
with
all
you
gentle
ones
i
must
say
on
my
part
however
that
i
was
right
glad
to
see
the
lanterns
come
down
to
the
waterside
which
i
knew
to
be
a
sure
sign
of
safety
we
hunters
and
guides
are
rude
beings
but
we
have
our
feelings
and
our
idees
as
well
as
any
general
in
the
army
both
jasper
and
i
would
have
died
before
you
should
have
come
to
harm
we
i
thank
you
for
all
you
did
for
me
pathfinder
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
thank
you
and
depend
on
it
my
father
shall
know
it
i
have
already
told
him
much
but
have
still
a
duty
to
perform
on
this
tush
mabel
the
sergeant
knows
what
the
woods
be
and
what
men
true
red
men
be
too
there
is
little
need
to
tell
him
anything
about
it
well
now
you
have
met
your
father
do
you
find
the
honest
old
soldier
the
sort
of
person
you
expected
to
find
he
is
my
own
dear
father
and
received
me
as
a
soldier
and
a
father
should
receive
a
child
have
you
known
him
long
pathfinder
that
is
as
people
count
time
i
was
just
twelve
when
the
sergeant
took
me
on
my
first
scouting
and
that
is
now
more
than
twenty
years
ago
we
had
a
tramping
time
of
it
and
as
it
was
before
your
day
you
would
have
had
no
father
had
not
the
rifle
been
one
of
my
natural
explain
it
is
too
simple
for
many
words
we
were
ambushed
and
the
sergeant
got
a
bad
hurt
and
would
have
lost
his
scalp
but
for
a
sort
of
inbred
turn
i
took
to
the
weapon
we
brought
him
off
however
and
a
handsomer
head
of
hair
for
his
time
of
life
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
rijiment
than
the
sergeant
carries
about
with
him
this
blessed
you
saved
my
father
life
pathfinder
exclaimed
mabel
unconsciously
though
warmly
taking
one
of
his
hard
sinewy
hands
into
both
her
own
god
bless
you
for
this
too
among
your
other
good
acts
nay
i
did
not
say
that
much
though
i
believe
i
did
save
his
scalp
a
man
might
live
without
a
scalp
and
so
i
can
not
say
i
saved
his
life
jasper
may
say
that
much
consarning
you
for
without
his
eye
and
arm
the
canoe
would
never
have
passed
the
rift
in
safety
on
a
night
like
the
last
the
gifts
of
the
lad
are
for
the
water
while
mine
are
for
the
hunt
and
the
trail
he
is
yonder
in
the
cove
there
looking
after
the
canoes
and
keeping
his
eye
on
his
beloved
little
craft
to
my
eye
there
is
no
likelier
youth
in
these
parts
than
jasper
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
left
her
room
mabel
now
turned
her
eyes
beneath
her
and
got
a
view
of
what
might
be
called
the
foreground
of
the
remarkable
picture
she
had
been
studying
with
so
much
pleasure
the
oswego
threw
its
dark
waters
into
the
lake
between
banks
of
some
height
that
on
its
eastern
side
being
bolder
and
projecting
farther
north
than
that
on
its
western
the
fort
was
on
the
latter
and
immediately
beneath
it
were
a
few
huts
of
logs
which
as
they
could
not
interfere
with
the
defence
of
the
place
had
been
erected
along
the
strand
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
and
containing
such
stores
as
were
landed
or
were
intended
to
be
embarked
in
the
communications
between
the
different
ports
on
the
shores
of
ontario
two
low
curved
gravelly
points
had
been
formed
with
surprising
regularity
by
the
counteracting
forces
of
the
northerly
winds
and
the
swift
current
and
inclining
from
the
storms
of
the
lake
formed
two
coves
within
the
river
that
on
the
western
side
was
the
most
deeply
indented
and
as
it
also
had
the
most
water
it
formed
a
sort
of
picturesque
little
port
for
the
post
it
was
along
the
narrow
strand
that
lay
between
the
low
height
of
the
fort
and
the
water
of
this
cove
that
the
rude
buildings
just
mentioned
had
been
erected
several
skiffs
bateaux
and
canoes
were
hauled
up
on
the
shore
and
in
the
cove
itself
lay
the
little
craft
from
which
jasper
obtained
his
claim
to
be
considered
a
sailor
she
was
might
have
been
of
forty
tons
burthen
was
so
neatly
constructed
and
painted
as
to
have
something
of
the
air
of
a
vessel
of
war
though
entirely
without
quarters
and
rigged
and
sparred
with
so
scrupulous
a
regard
to
proportions
and
beauty
as
well
as
fitness
and
judgment
as
to
give
her
an
appearance
that
even
mabel
at
once
distinguished
to
be
gallant
and
trim
her
mould
was
admirable
for
a
wright
of
great
skill
had
sent
her
drafts
from
england
at
the
express
request
of
the
officer
who
had
caused
her
to
be
constructed
her
paint
dark
warlike
and
neat
and
the
long
pennant
that
she
wore
at
once
proclaimed
her
to
be
the
property
of
the
king
her
name
was
the
that
then
is
the
vessel
of
jasper
said
mabel
who
associated
the
master
of
the
little
craft
very
naturally
with
the
cutter
itself
are
there
many
others
on
this
lake
the
frenchers
have
three
one
of
which
they
tell
me
is
a
real
ship
such
as
are
used
on
the
ocean
another
a
brig
and
a
third
is
a
cutter
like
the
here
which
they
call
the
in
their
own
tongue
however
and
which
seems
to
have
a
natural
hatred
of
our
own
pretty
boat
for
jasper
seldom
goes
out
that
the
is
not
at
his
and
is
jasper
one
to
run
from
a
frenchman
though
he
appears
in
the
shape
of
a
squirrel
and
that
too
on
the
water
of
what
use
would
valor
be
without
the
means
of
turning
it
to
account
jasper
is
a
brave
boy
as
all
on
this
frontier
know
but
he
has
no
gun
except
a
little
howitzer
and
then
his
crew
consists
only
of
two
men
besides
himself
and
a
boy
i
was
with
him
in
one
of
his
trampooses
and
the
youngster
was
risky
enough
for
he
brought
us
so
near
the
enemy
that
rifles
began
to
talk
but
the
frenchers
carry
cannon
and
ports
and
never
show
their
faces
outside
of
frontenac
without
having
some
twenty
men
besides
their
in
their
cutter
no
no
this
was
built
for
flying
and
the
major
says
he
will
not
put
her
in
a
fighting
humor
by
giving
her
men
and
arms
lest
she
should
take
him
at
his
word
and
get
her
wings
clipped
i
know
little
of
these
things
for
my
gifts
are
not
at
all
in
that
way
but
i
see
the
reason
of
the
thing
i
see
its
reason
though
jasper
does
ah
here
is
my
uncle
none
the
worse
for
his
swim
coming
to
look
at
this
inland
sure
enough
cap
who
had
announced
his
approach
by
a
couple
of
lusty
hems
now
made
his
appearance
on
the
bastion
where
after
nodding
to
his
niece
and
her
companion
he
made
a
deliberate
survey
of
the
expanse
of
water
before
him
in
order
to
effect
this
at
his
ease
the
mariner
mounted
on
one
of
the
old
iron
guns
folded
his
arms
across
his
breast
and
balanced
his
body
as
if
he
felt
the
motion
of
a
vessel
to
complete
the
picture
he
had
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
well
master
cap
asked
the
pathfinder
innocently
for
he
did
not
detect
the
expression
of
contempt
that
was
gradually
settling
on
the
features
of
the
other
is
it
not
a
beautiful
sheet
and
fit
to
be
named
a
sea
this
then
is
what
you
call
your
lake
demanded
cap
sweeping
the
northern
horizon
with
his
pipe
i
say
is
this
really
your
lake
sartain
and
if
the
judgment
of
one
who
has
lived
on
the
shores
of
many
others
can
be
taken
a
very
good
lake
it
just
as
i
expected
a
pond
in
dimensions
and
a
in
taste
it
is
all
in
vain
to
travel
inland
in
the
hope
of
seeing
anything
either
or
useful
i
knew
it
would
turn
out
just
in
this
what
is
the
matter
with
ontario
master
cap
it
is
large
and
fair
to
look
at
and
pleasant
enough
to
drink
for
those
who
ca
get
at
the
water
of
the
do
you
call
this
large
asked
cap
again
sweeping
the
air
with
the
pipe
i
will
just
ask
you
what
there
is
large
about
it
did
jasper
himself
confess
that
it
was
only
some
twenty
leagues
from
shore
to
shore
but
uncle
interposed
mabel
no
land
is
to
be
seen
except
here
on
our
own
coast
to
me
it
looks
exactly
like
the
this
bit
of
a
pond
look
like
the
ocean
well
magnet
that
from
a
girl
who
has
had
real
seamen
in
her
family
is
downright
nonsense
what
is
there
about
it
pray
that
has
even
the
outline
of
a
sea
on
it
why
there
is
water
water
water
nothing
but
water
for
miles
on
miles
far
as
the
eye
can
and
is
there
water
water
water
nothing
but
water
for
miles
on
miles
in
your
rivers
that
you
have
been
canoeing
through
too
ay
and
far
as
the
eye
can
see
in
the
bargain
yes
uncle
but
the
rivers
have
their
banks
and
there
are
trees
along
them
and
they
are
and
is
this
a
bank
where
we
stand
do
these
soldiers
call
this
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
are
there
trees
in
thousands
and
twenty
leagues
narrow
enough
of
all
conscience
who
the
devil
ever
heard
of
the
banks
of
the
ocean
unless
it
might
be
the
banks
that
are
under
water
but
uncle
we
can
not
see
across
this
lake
as
we
can
see
across
a
there
you
are
out
magnet
are
the
amazon
and
oronoco
and
la
plata
rivers
and
can
you
see
across
them
pathfinder
i
very
much
doubt
if
this
stripe
of
water
here
be
even
a
lake
for
to
me
it
appears
to
be
only
a
river
you
are
by
no
means
particular
about
your
geography
i
find
up
here
in
the
there
are
out
master
cap
there
is
a
river
and
a
noble
one
too
at
each
end
of
it
but
this
is
old
ontario
before
you
and
though
it
is
not
my
gift
to
live
on
a
lake
to
my
judgment
there
are
few
better
than
and
uncle
if
we
stood
on
the
beach
at
rockaway
what
more
should
we
see
than
we
now
behold
there
is
a
shore
on
one
side
or
banks
there
and
trees
too
as
well
as
those
which
are
this
is
perverseness
magnet
and
young
girls
should
steer
clear
of
anything
like
obstinacy
in
the
first
place
the
ocean
has
coasts
but
no
banks
except
the
grand
banks
as
i
tell
you
which
are
out
of
sight
of
land
and
you
will
not
pretend
that
this
bank
is
out
of
sight
of
land
or
even
under
water
as
mabel
could
not
very
plausibly
set
up
this
extravagant
opinion
cap
pursued
the
subject
his
countenance
beginning
to
discover
the
triumph
of
a
successful
disputant
and
then
them
trees
bear
no
comparison
to
these
trees
the
coasts
of
the
ocean
have
farms
and
cities
and
and
in
some
parts
of
the
world
castles
and
monasteries
and
lighthouses
ay
ay
lighthouses
in
particular
on
them
not
one
of
all
which
things
is
to
be
seen
here
no
no
master
pathfinder
i
never
heard
of
an
ocean
that
had
more
or
less
lighthouses
on
it
whereas
hereaway
there
is
not
even
a
there
is
what
is
better
there
is
what
is
better
a
forest
and
noble
trees
a
fit
temple
of
ay
your
forest
may
do
for
a
lake
but
of
what
use
would
an
ocean
be
if
the
earth
all
around
it
were
forest
ships
would
be
unnecessary
as
timber
might
be
floated
in
rafts
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
trade
and
what
would
a
world
be
without
trade
i
am
of
that
opinion
who
says
human
nature
was
invented
for
the
purposes
of
trade
magnet
i
am
astonished
that
you
should
think
this
water
even
looks
like
now
i
daresay
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
whale
in
all
your
lake
master
pathfinder
i
never
heard
of
one
i
will
confess
but
i
am
no
judge
of
animals
that
live
in
the
water
unless
it
be
the
fishes
of
the
rivers
and
the
nor
a
grampus
nor
a
porpoise
even
not
so
much
as
a
poor
devil
of
a
shark
i
will
not
take
it
on
myself
to
say
there
is
either
my
gifts
are
not
in
that
way
i
tell
you
master
nor
herring
nor
albatross
nor
continued
cap
who
kept
his
eye
fastened
on
the
guide
in
order
to
see
how
far
he
might
venture
no
such
thing
as
a
fish
that
can
fly
i
daresay
a
fish
that
can
fly
master
cap
master
cap
do
not
think
because
we
are
mere
borderers
that
we
have
no
idees
of
natur
and
what
she
has
been
pleased
to
do
i
know
there
are
squirrels
that
can
fly
a
squirrel
fly
the
devil
master
pathfinder
do
you
suppose
that
you
have
got
a
boy
on
his
first
up
here
among
you
i
know
nothing
of
your
master
cap
though
i
suppose
them
to
have
been
many
for
as
for
what
belongs
to
natur
in
the
woods
what
i
have
seen
i
may
tell
and
not
fear
the
face
of
and
do
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
you
have
seen
a
squirrel
fly
if
you
wish
to
understand
the
power
of
god
master
cap
you
will
do
well
to
believe
that
and
many
other
things
of
a
like
natur
for
you
may
be
quite
sartain
it
is
and
yet
pathfinder
said
mabel
looking
so
prettily
and
sweetly
even
while
she
played
with
the
guide
infirmity
that
he
forgave
her
in
his
heart
you
who
speak
so
reverently
of
the
power
of
the
deity
appear
to
doubt
that
a
fish
can
i
have
not
said
it
i
have
not
said
it
and
if
master
cap
is
ready
to
testify
to
the
fact
unlikely
as
it
seems
i
am
willing
to
try
to
think
it
true
i
think
it
every
man
duty
to
believe
in
the
power
of
god
however
difficult
it
may
and
why
is
my
fish
as
likely
to
have
wings
as
your
squirrel
demanded
cap
with
more
logic
than
was
his
wont
that
fishes
do
and
can
fly
is
as
true
as
it
is
nay
that
is
the
only
difficulty
in
believing
the
story
rejoined
the
guide
it
seems
unreasonable
to
give
an
animal
that
lives
in
the
water
wings
which
seemingly
can
be
of
no
use
to
and
do
you
suppose
that
the
fishes
are
such
asses
as
to
fly
about
under
water
when
they
are
once
fairly
fitted
out
with
wings
nay
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
but
that
fish
should
fly
in
the
air
seems
more
contrary
to
natur
still
than
that
they
should
fly
in
their
own
element
that
in
which
they
were
born
and
brought
up
as
one
might
so
much
for
contracted
ideas
magnet
the
fish
fly
out
of
water
to
run
away
from
their
enemies
in
the
water
and
there
you
see
not
only
the
fact
but
the
reason
for
then
i
suppose
it
must
be
true
said
the
guide
quietly
how
long
are
their
flights
not
quite
as
far
as
those
of
pigeons
perhaps
but
far
enough
to
make
an
offing
as
for
those
squirrels
of
yours
we
say
no
more
about
them
friend
pathfinder
as
i
suppose
they
were
mentioned
just
as
a
to
the
fish
in
favor
of
the
woods
but
what
is
this
thing
anchored
here
under
the
hill
that
is
the
cutter
of
jasper
uncle
said
mabel
hurriedly
and
a
very
pretty
vessel
i
think
it
is
its
name
too
is
the
ay
it
will
do
well
enough
for
a
lake
perhaps
but
it
no
great
affair
the
lad
has
got
a
standing
bowsprit
and
who
ever
saw
a
cutter
with
a
standing
bowsprit
before
but
may
there
not
be
some
good
reason
for
it
on
a
lake
like
this
uncle
sure
enough
i
must
remember
this
is
not
the
ocean
though
it
does
look
so
much
like
ah
uncle
then
ontario
does
look
like
the
ocean
after
all
in
your
eyes
i
mean
and
those
of
pathfinder
not
in
the
least
in
mine
magnet
now
you
might
set
me
down
out
yonder
in
the
middle
of
this
bit
of
a
pond
and
that
too
in
the
darkest
night
that
ever
fell
from
the
heavens
and
in
the
smallest
canoe
and
i
could
tell
you
it
was
only
a
lake
for
that
matter
the
the
name
of
his
vessel
would
find
it
out
as
quick
as
i
could
myself
i
do
not
believe
that
brig
would
make
more
than
a
couple
of
short
stretches
at
the
most
before
she
would
perceive
the
difference
between
ontario
and
the
old
atlantic
i
once
took
her
down
into
one
of
the
large
south
american
bays
and
she
behaved
herself
as
awkwardly
as
a
booby
would
in
a
church
with
the
congregation
in
a
hurry
and
jasper
sails
that
boat
i
must
have
a
cruise
with
the
lad
magnet
before
i
quit
you
just
for
the
name
of
the
thing
it
would
never
do
to
say
i
got
in
sight
of
this
pond
and
went
away
without
taking
a
trip
on
well
well
you
need
wait
long
for
that
returned
pathfinder
for
the
sergeant
is
about
to
embark
with
a
party
to
relieve
a
post
among
the
thousand
islands
and
as
i
heard
him
say
he
intended
that
mabel
should
go
along
you
can
join
the
company
is
this
true
magnet
i
believe
it
is
returned
the
girl
a
flush
so
imperceptible
as
to
escape
the
observation
of
her
companions
glowing
on
her
cheeks
though
i
have
had
so
little
opportunity
to
talk
with
my
dear
father
that
i
am
not
quite
certain
here
he
comes
however
and
you
can
inquire
of
notwithstanding
his
humble
rank
there
was
something
in
the
mien
and
character
of
sergeant
dunham
that
commanded
respect
of
a
tall
imposing
figure
grave
and
saturnine
disposition
and
accurate
and
precise
in
his
acts
and
manner
of
thinking
even
cap
dogmatical
and
supercilious
as
he
usually
was
with
landsmen
did
not
presume
to
take
the
same
liberties
with
the
old
soldier
as
he
did
with
his
other
friends
it
was
often
remarked
that
sergeant
dunham
received
more
true
respect
from
duncan
of
lundie
the
scotch
laird
who
commanded
the
post
than
most
of
the
subalterns
for
experience
and
tried
services
were
of
quite
as
much
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
veteran
major
as
birth
and
money
while
the
sergeant
never
even
hoped
to
rise
any
higher
he
so
far
respected
himself
and
his
present
station
as
always
to
act
in
a
way
to
command
attention
and
the
habit
of
mixing
so
much
with
inferiors
whose
passions
and
dispositions
he
felt
it
necessary
to
restrain
by
distance
and
dignity
had
so
far
colored
his
whole
deportment
that
few
were
altogether
free
from
its
influence
while
the
captains
treated
him
kindly
and
as
an
old
comrade
the
lieutenants
seldom
ventured
to
dissent
from
his
military
opinions
and
the
ensigns
it
was
remarked
actually
manifested
a
species
of
respect
that
amounted
to
something
very
like
deference
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
the
announcement
of
mabel
put
a
sudden
termination
to
the
singular
dialogue
we
have
just
related
though
it
had
been
often
observed
that
the
pathfinder
was
the
only
man
on
that
frontier
beneath
the
condition
of
a
gentleman
who
presumed
to
treat
the
sergeant
at
all
as
an
equal
or
even
with
the
cordial
familiarity
of
a
friend
good
morrow
brother
cap
said
the
sergeant
giving
the
military
salute
as
he
walked
in
a
grave
stately
manner
on
the
bastion
my
morning
duty
has
made
me
seem
forgetful
of
you
and
mabel
but
we
have
now
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
and
to
get
acquainted
do
you
not
perceive
brother
a
strong
likeness
on
the
girl
to
her
we
have
so
long
lost
mabel
is
the
image
of
her
mother
sergeant
as
i
have
always
said
with
a
little
of
your
firmer
figure
though
for
that
matter
the
caps
were
never
wanting
in
spring
and
mabel
cast
a
timid
glance
at
the
stern
rigid
countenance
of
her
father
of
whom
she
had
ever
thought
as
the
dwell
on
the
affection
of
their
absent
parents
and
as
she
saw
that
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
working
notwithstanding
the
stiffness
and
method
of
his
manner
her
very
heart
yearned
to
throw
herself
on
his
bosom
and
to
weep
at
will
but
he
was
so
much
colder
in
externals
so
much
more
formal
and
distant
than
she
had
expected
to
find
him
that
she
would
not
have
dared
to
hazard
the
freedom
even
had
they
been
alone
you
have
taken
a
long
and
troublesome
journey
brother
on
my
account
and
we
will
try
to
make
you
comfortable
while
you
stay
among
i
hear
you
are
likely
to
receive
orders
to
lift
your
anchor
sergeant
and
to
shift
your
berth
into
a
part
of
the
world
where
they
say
there
are
a
thousand
pathfinder
this
is
some
of
your
forgetfulness
nay
nay
sergeant
i
forgot
nothing
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
necessary
to
hide
your
intentions
so
very
closely
from
your
own
flesh
and
all
military
movements
ought
to
be
made
with
as
little
conversation
as
possible
returned
the
sergeant
tapping
the
guide
shoulder
in
a
friendly
but
reproachful
manner
you
have
passed
too
much
of
your
life
in
front
of
the
french
not
to
know
the
value
of
silence
but
no
matter
the
thing
must
soon
be
known
and
there
is
no
great
use
in
trying
now
to
conceal
it
we
shall
embark
a
relief
party
shortly
for
a
post
on
the
lake
though
i
do
not
say
it
is
for
the
thousand
islands
and
i
may
have
to
go
with
it
in
which
case
i
intend
to
take
mabel
to
make
my
broth
for
me
and
i
hope
brother
you
will
not
despise
a
soldier
fare
for
a
month
or
that
will
depend
on
the
manner
of
marching
i
have
no
love
for
woods
and
we
shall
sail
in
the
and
indeed
the
whole
service
which
is
no
stranger
to
us
is
likely
enough
to
please
one
accustomed
to
the
ay
to
if
you
will
but
not
to
if
you
have
no
person
to
handle
that
bit
of
a
cutter
for
you
i
have
no
objection
to
ship
for
the
notwithstanding
though
i
shall
look
on
the
whole
affair
as
so
much
time
thrown
away
for
i
consider
it
an
imposition
to
call
sailing
about
this
pond
going
to
jasper
is
every
way
able
to
manage
the
brother
cap
and
in
that
light
i
can
not
say
that
we
have
need
of
your
services
though
we
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
you
can
not
return
to
the
settlement
until
a
party
is
sent
in
and
that
is
not
likely
to
happen
until
after
my
return
well
pathfinder
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
men
on
the
trail
of
the
mingos
and
you
not
at
their
to
be
honest
with
you
sergeant
returned
the
guide
not
without
a
little
awkwardness
of
manner
and
a
perceptible
difference
in
the
hue
of
a
face
that
had
become
so
uniformly
red
by
exposure
i
have
not
felt
that
it
was
my
gift
this
morning
in
the
first
place
i
very
well
know
that
the
soldiers
of
the
are
not
the
lads
to
overtake
iroquois
in
the
woods
and
the
knaves
did
not
wait
to
be
surrounded
when
they
knew
that
jasper
had
reached
the
garrison
then
a
man
may
take
a
little
rest
after
a
summer
of
hard
work
and
no
impeachment
of
his
goodwill
besides
the
sarpent
is
out
with
them
and
if
the
miscreants
are
to
be
found
at
all
you
may
trust
to
his
inmity
and
sight
the
first
being
stronger
and
the
last
nearly
if
not
quite
as
good
as
my
own
he
loves
the
skulking
vagabonds
as
little
as
myself
and
for
that
matter
i
may
say
that
my
own
feelings
towards
a
mingo
are
not
much
more
than
the
gifts
of
a
delaware
grafted
on
a
christian
stock
no
no
i
thought
i
would
leave
the
honor
this
time
if
honor
there
is
to
be
to
the
young
ensign
that
commands
who
if
he
do
lose
his
scalp
may
boast
of
his
campaign
in
his
letters
to
his
mother
when
he
gets
in
i
thought
i
would
play
idler
once
in
my
and
no
one
has
a
better
right
if
long
and
faithful
service
entitles
a
man
to
a
furlough
returned
the
sergeant
kindly
mabel
will
think
none
the
worse
of
you
for
preferring
her
company
to
the
trail
of
the
savages
and
i
daresay
will
be
happy
to
give
you
a
part
of
her
breakfast
if
you
are
inclined
to
eat
you
must
not
think
girl
however
that
the
pathfinder
is
in
the
habit
of
letting
prowlers
around
the
fort
beat
a
retreat
without
hearing
the
crack
of
his
if
i
thought
she
did
sergeant
though
not
much
given
to
showy
and
parade
evolutions
i
would
shoulder
killdeer
and
quit
the
garrison
before
her
pretty
eyes
had
time
to
frown
no
no
mabel
knows
me
better
though
we
are
but
new
acquaintances
for
there
has
been
no
want
of
mingos
to
enliven
the
short
march
we
have
already
made
in
it
would
need
a
great
deal
of
testimony
pathfinder
to
make
me
think
ill
of
you
in
any
way
and
more
than
all
in
the
way
you
mention
returned
mabel
coloring
with
the
sincere
earnestness
with
which
she
endeavored
to
remove
any
suspicion
to
the
contrary
from
his
mind
both
father
and
daughter
i
believe
owe
you
their
lives
and
believe
me
that
neither
will
ever
forget
thank
you
mabel
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
but
i
will
not
take
advantage
of
your
ignorance
neither
girl
and
therefore
shall
say
i
do
not
think
the
mingos
would
have
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
had
they
succeeded
by
their
devilries
and
contrivances
in
getting
you
into
their
hands
my
scalp
and
jasper
and
master
cap
there
and
the
too
would
sartainly
have
been
smoked
but
as
for
the
daughter
i
do
not
think
they
would
have
hurt
a
hair
of
her
and
why
should
i
suppose
that
enemies
known
to
spare
neither
women
nor
children
would
have
shown
more
mercy
to
me
than
to
another
i
feel
pathfinder
that
i
owe
you
my
i
say
nay
mabel
they
would
have
had
the
heart
to
hurt
you
no
not
even
a
fiery
mingo
devil
would
have
had
the
heart
to
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
bad
as
i
suspect
the
vampires
to
be
i
do
not
suspect
them
of
anything
so
wicked
as
that
they
might
have
wished
you
nay
forced
you
to
become
the
wife
of
one
of
their
chiefs
and
that
would
be
torment
enough
to
a
christian
young
woman
but
beyond
that
i
do
not
think
even
the
mingos
themselves
would
have
well
then
i
shall
owe
my
escape
from
this
great
misfortune
to
you
said
mabel
taking
his
hard
hand
into
her
own
frankly
and
cordially
and
certainly
in
a
way
to
delight
the
honest
guide
to
me
it
would
be
a
lighter
evil
to
be
killed
than
to
become
the
wife
of
an
that
is
her
gift
sergeant
exclaimed
pathfinder
turning
to
his
old
comrade
with
gratification
written
on
every
lineament
of
his
honest
countenance
and
it
will
have
its
way
i
tell
the
sarpent
that
no
christianizing
will
ever
make
even
a
delaware
a
white
man
nor
any
whooping
and
yelling
convert
a
into
a
that
is
the
gift
of
a
young
woman
born
of
christian
parents
and
it
ought
to
be
you
are
right
pathfinder
and
so
far
as
mabel
dunham
is
concerned
it
be
maintained
but
it
is
time
to
break
your
fasts
and
if
you
will
follow
me
brother
cap
i
will
show
you
how
we
poor
soldiers
live
here
on
a
distant
chapter
ix
now
my
and
partners
in
exile
hath
not
old
custom
made
this
life
more
sweet
than
that
of
painted
pomp
are
not
these
woods
more
free
from
peril
than
the
envious
court
here
feel
we
but
the
penalty
of
adam
you
like
sergeant
dunham
made
no
empty
vaunt
when
he
gave
the
promise
conveyed
in
the
closing
words
of
the
last
chapter
notwithstanding
the
remote
frontier
position
of
the
post
they
who
lived
at
it
enjoyed
a
table
that
in
many
respects
kings
and
princes
might
have
envied
at
the
period
of
our
tale
and
indeed
for
half
a
century
later
the
whole
of
that
vast
region
which
has
been
called
the
west
or
the
new
countries
since
the
war
of
the
revolution
lay
a
comparatively
unpeopled
desert
teeming
with
all
the
living
productions
of
nature
that
properly
belonged
to
the
climate
man
and
the
domestic
animals
excepted
the
few
indians
that
roamed
its
forests
then
could
produce
no
visible
effects
on
the
abundance
of
the
game
and
the
scattered
garrisons
or
occasional
hunters
that
here
and
there
were
to
be
met
with
on
that
vast
surface
had
no
other
influence
than
the
bee
on
the
buckwheat
field
or
the
on
the
flower
the
marvels
that
have
descended
to
our
own
times
in
the
way
of
tradition
concerning
the
quantities
of
beasts
birds
and
fishes
that
were
then
to
be
met
with
on
the
shores
of
the
great
lakes
in
particular
are
known
to
be
sustained
by
the
experience
of
living
men
else
might
we
hesitate
about
relating
them
but
having
been
of
some
of
these
prodigies

office
shall
be
discharged

supplied

various
sorts

in
its
river
and
the
sportsman
had
only
to
cast
his
line
to
haul
in
a
bass
or
some
other
member
of
the
finny
tribe
which
then
peopled
the

the

the
swamps
of
this
fruitful
latitude

known
to
be
filled
with
insects
among

the
salmon
of

a
variety
of
that
species

is
scarcely
inferior
to
the
delicious
salmon

complete
the
sum
of
the
natural
supplies
on
which
all
the
posts
depended
more
or
less
to
relieve
the
unavoidable
privations
of
their
remote
frontier
positions
in
a
place
where
viands
that
would
elsewhere
be
deemed
great
luxuries
were
so
abundant
no
one
was
excluded
from
their
enjoyment
the
meanest
individual
at
oswego
habitually
feasted
on
game
that
would
have
formed
the
boast
of
a
parisian
table
and
it
was
no
more
than
a
healthful
commentary
on
the
caprices
of
taste
and
of
the
waywardness
of
human
desires
that
the
very
diet
which
in
other
scenes
would
have
been
deemed
the
subject
of
envy
and
repinings
got
to
pall
on
the
appetite

coarse
and
regular
food
of
the
army

it
became
necessary
to
husband
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
transportation
rose
in
the
estimation
of
the
common
soldier
and
at
any
time
he
would
cheerfully
desert
his
venison
and
ducks
and
pigeons
and
salmon
to
banquet
on
the
sweets
of
pickled
pork
stringy
turnips
and
cabbage
the
table
of
sergeant
dunham
as
a
matter
of
course
partook
of
the
abundance
and
luxuries
of
the
frontier
as
well
as
of
its
privations
a
delicious
broiled
salmon
smoked
on
a
homely
platter
hot
venison
steaks
sent
up
their
appetizing
odors
and
several
dishes
of
cold
meats
all
of
which
were
composed
of
game
had
been
set
before
the
guests
in
honor
of
the
newly
arrived
visitors
and
in
vindication
of
the
old
hospitality
you
do
not
seem
to
be
on
short
allowance
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
sergeant

after
he
had
got
fairly
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
different
dishes
your
salmon
might

for
among
two

three
hundred

fellows
that
we
have
in
this
garrison
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
who
will
not

that
the

is
unfit
to
be
eaten
even
some
of
the

who
never
tasted

as
poachers

turn
up
their
noses
at
the
fattest
haunches

i
must
say
it

sometimes
swear
that
an
oatmeal
cake
is
better
fare
than
the

they
do

that

the

willing

wait
rather
than
suffer
the
hardships
of

in

wild

all
of
which

is
not
according
to
my
notions
of

your

thought
i
hope
sergeant
you
do
not
think
of
mabel
for
a
soldier
wife
returned
cap
gravely
our
family
has
done
its
share
in
that
way
already
and
it
high
time
that
the
sea
was
again
i
do
not
think
of
finding
a
husband
for
the
girl
in
the
or
any
other
regiment
i
can
promise
you
brother
though
i
do
think
it
getting
to
be
time
that
the
child
were
respectably
father
is
not
their
gifts
sergeant
to
talk
of
these
matters
in
so
open
a
manner
said
the
guide
for
i
seen
it
verified
by
experience
that
he
who
would
follow
the
trail
of
a
virgin
must
not
go
shouting
out
his
thoughts
behind
her
so
if
you
please
we
will
talk
of
something
well
then
brother
cap
i
hope
that
bit
of
a
cold
roasted
pig
is
to
your
mind
you
seem
to
fancy
the
ay
ay
give
me
civilized
grub
if
i
must
eat
returned
the
pertinacious
seaman
venison
is
well
enough
for
your
inland
sailors
but
we
of
the
ocean
like
a
little
of
that
which
we
here
pathfinder
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
indulged
in
a
hearty
laugh
though
in
his
always
silent
manner
then
he
asked
with
a
little
curiosity
in
his
manner
do
you
miss
the
skin
master
cap
do
you
miss
the
skin
it
would
have
been
better
for
its
jacket
i
think
myself
pathfinder
but
i
suppose
it
is
a
fashion
of
the
woods
to
serve
up
shoats
in
this
well
well
a
man
may
go
round
the
and
not
know
everything
if
you
had
had
the
skinning
of
that
pig
master

it
would
have
left
you
sore
hands
the
cratur
is
a
hedgehog
blast
me
if
i
thought
it
wholesome
natural
pork
either
returned
cap
but
then
i
believed
even
a
pig
might
lose
some
of
its
good
qualities
up
hereaway
in
the
if
the
skinning
of
it
brother
does
not
fall
to
my
duty
pathfinder
i
hope
you
did
find
mabel
disobedient
on
the
march
not
she
not
she
if
mabel
is
only
half
as
well
satisfied
with
jasper
and
pathfinder
as
the
pathfinder
and
jasper
are
satisfied
with
her
sergeant
we
shall
be
friends
for
the
remainder
of
our
as
the
guide
spoke
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
blushing
girl
with
a
sort
of
innocent
desire
to
know
her
opinion
and
then
with
an
inborn
delicacy
which
proved
he
was
far
superior
to
the
vulgar
desire
to
invade
the
sanctity
of
feminine
feeling
he
looked
at
his
plate
and
seemed
to
regret
his
own
boldness
well
well
we
must
remember
that
women
are
not
men
my
friend
resumed
the
sergeant
and
make
proper
allowances
for
nature
and
education
a
recruit
is
not
a
veteran
any
man
knows
that
it
takes
longer
to
make
a
good
soldier
than
it
takes
to
make
anything
this
is
new
doctrine
sergeant
said
cap
with
some
spirit
we
old
seamen
are
apt
to
think
that
six
soldiers
ay
and
capital
soldiers
too
might
be
made
while
one
sailor
is
getting
his
ay
brother
cap
i
seen
something
of
the
opinions
which
seafaring
men
have
of
themselves
returned
the
with
a
smile

bland

comported
with
his
saturnine
features

years

of
the
garrison
in
a
seaport
you
and
i
have
conversed
on
the
subject
before
and
i
afraid
we
shall
never
agree
but
if
you
wish
to
know
what
the
difference
is
between
a
real
soldier
and
man
in
what
i
should
call
a
state
of
nature
you
have
only
to
look
at
a
battalion
of
the
on
parade
this
afternoon
and
then
when
you
get
back
to
york
examine
one
of
the
militia
regiments
making
its
greatest
well
to
my
eye
sergeant
there
is
very
little
difference
not
more
than
you
find
between
a
brig
and
a
snow
to
me
they
seem
alike
all
scarlet
and
feathers
and
powder
and
so
much
sir
for
the
judgment
of
a
sailor
returned
the
sergeant
with
dignity
but
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
it
requires
a
year
to
teach
a
true
soldier
how
to
eat
so
much
the
worse
for
him
the
militia
know
how
to
eat
at
starting
for
i
have
often
heard
that
on
their
marches
they
commonly
eat
all
before
them
even
if
they
do
nothing
they
have
their
gifts
i
suppose
like
other
men
observed
pathfinder
with
a
view
to
preserve
the
peace
which
was
evidently
in
some
danger
of
being
broken
by
the
obstinate
predilection
of
each
of
the
disputants
in
favor
of
his
own
calling
and
when
a
man
has
his
gift
from
providence
it
is
commonly
idle
to
endeavor
to
bear
up
against
it
the
sergeant
is
a
judicous
regiment
in
the
way
of
eating
as
i
know
from
having
been
so
long
in
its
company
though
i
daresay
militia
corps
could
be
found
that
would
outdo
them
in
feats
of
that
natur
uncle
said
mabel
if
you
have
breakfasted
i
will
thank
you
to
go
out
upon
the
bastion
with
me
again
we
have
neither
of
us
half
seen
the
lake
and
it
would
be
hardly
seemly
for
a
young
woman
to
be
walking
about
the
fort
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
quite
cap
understood
the
motive
of
mabel
and
having
at
the
bottom
a
hearty
friendship
for
his
he
was
willing
enough
to
defer
the
argument
until
they
had
been
longer
together
for
the
idea
of
abandoning
it
altogether
never
crossed
the
mind
of
one
so
dogmatical
and
obstinate
he
accordingly
accompanied
his
niece
leaving
sergeant
dunham
and
his
friend
the
pathfinder
alone
together
as
soon
as
his
adversary
had
beat
a
retreat
the
sergeant
who
did
not
quite
so
well
understand
the
manoeuvre
of
his
daughter
turned
to
his
companion
and
with
a
smile
which
was
not
without
triumph
he
remarked
the
army
pathfinder
has
never
yet
done
itself
justice
in
the
way
of
asserting
its
rights
and
though
modesty
becomes
a
man
whether
he
is
in
a
red
coat
or
a
black
one
or
for
that
matter
in
his
i
do
like
to
let
a
good
opportunity
slip
of
saying
a
word
in
its
behalf
well
my
friend
laying
his
own
hand
on
one
of
the
pathfinder
and
giving
it
a
hearty
squeeze
how
do
you
like
the
girl
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
her
sergeant
i
have
seen
many
of
her
sex
and
some
that
were
great
and
beautiful
but
never
before
did
i
meet
with
one
in
whom
i
thought
providence
had
so
well
balanced
the
different
and
the
good
opinion
i
can
tell
you
pathfinder
is
mutual
she
told
me
last
night
all
about
your
coolness
and
spirit
and
kindness
particularly
the
last
for
kindness
counts
for
more
than
half
with
females
my
friend
and
the
first
inspection
seems
to
give
satisfaction
on
both
sides
brush
up
the
uniform
and
pay
a
little
more
attention
to
the
outside
pathfinder
and
you
will
have
the
girl
heart
and
nay
nay
sergeant
i
forgotten
nothing
that
you
have
told
me
and
grudge
no
reasonable
pains
to
make
myself
as
pleasant
in
the
eyes
of
mabel
as
she
is
getting
to
be
in
mine
i
cleaned
and
brightened
up
killdeer
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
and
in
my
judgment
the
piece
never
looked
better
than
it
does
at
this
very
that
is
according
to
your
hunting
notions
pathfinder
but
firearms
should
sparkle
and
glitter
in
the
sun
and
i
never
yet
could
see
any
beauty
in
a
clouded
lord
howe
thought
otherwise
sergeant
and
he
was
accounted
a
good
very
true
his
lordship
had
all
the
barrels
of
his
regiment
darkened
and
what
good
came
of
it
you
can
see
his
hanging
in
the
english
church
at
albany
no
no
my
worthy
friend
a
soldier
should
be
a
soldier
and
at
no
time
ought
he
to
be
ashamed
or
afraid
to
carry
about
him
the
signs
and
symbols
of
his
honorable
trade
had
you
much
discourse
with
mabel
pathfinder
as
you
came
along
in
the
canoe
there
was
not
much
opportunity
sergeant
and
then
i
found
myself
so
much
beneath
her
in
idees
that
i
was
afraid
to
speak
of
much
beyond
what
belonged
to
my
own
therein
you
are
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
my
friend
women
love
trifling
discourse
though
they
like
to
have
most
of
it
to
themselves
now
you
know
i
a
man
that
do
not
loosen
my
tongue
at
every
giddy
thought
and
yet
there
were
days
when
i
could
see
that
mabel
mother
thought
none
the
worse
of
me
because
i
descended
a
little
from
my
manhood
it
is
true
i
was
years
younger
then
than
i
am
and
moreover
instead
of
being
the
oldest
sergeant
in
the
regiment
i
was
the
youngest
dignity
is
commanding
and
useful
and
there
is
no
getting
on
without
it
as
respects
the
men
but
if
you
would
be
thoroughly
esteemed
by
a
woman
it
is
necessary
to
condescend
a
little
on
ah
me
sergeant
i
sometimes
fear
it
will
never
why
do
you
think
so
discouragingly
of
a
matter
on
which
i
thought
both
our
minds
were
made
up
we
did
agree
if
mabel
should
prove
what
you
told
me
she
was
and
if
the
girl
could
fancy
a
rude
hunter
and
guide
that
i
should
quit
some
of
my
wandering
ways
and
try
to
humanize
my
mind
down
to
a
wife
and
children
but
since
i
have
seen
the
girl
i
will
own
that
many
misgivings
have
come
over
how
this
interrupted
the
sergeant
sternly
did
i
not
understand
you
to
say
that
you
were
pleased
and
is
mabel
a
young
woman
to
disappoint
expectation
ah
sergeant
it
is
not
mabel
that
i
distrust
but
myself
i
am
but
a
poor
ignorant
woodsman
after
all
and
perhaps
i
not
in
truth
as
good
as
even
you
and
i
may
think
if
you
doubt
your
own
judgment
of
yourself
pathfinder
i
beg
you
will
not
doubt
mine
am
i
not
accustomed
to
judge
men
character
and
am
i
often
deceived
ask
major
duncan
sir
if
you
desire
any
assurances
in
this
but
sergeant
we
have
long
been
friends
have
side
by
side
a
dozen
times
and
have
done
each
other
many
services
when
this
is
the
case
men
are
apt
to
think
over
kindly
of
each
other
and
i
fear
me
that
the
daughter
may
not
be
so
likely
to
view
a
plain
ignorant
hunter
as
favorably
as
the
father
tut
tut
pathfinder
you
do
know
yourself
man
and
may
put
all
faith
in
my
judgment
in
the
first
place
you
have
experience
and
as
all
girls
must
want
that
no
prudent
young
woman
would
overlook
such
a
qualification
then
you
are
not
one
of
the
coxcombs
that
strut
about
when
they
first
join
a
regiment
but
a
man
who
has
seen
service
and
who
carries
the
marks
of
it
on
his
person
and
countenance
i
daresay
you
have
been
under
fire
some
thirty
or
forty
times
counting
all
the
skirmishes
and
ambushes
that
you
all
of
that
sergeant
all
of
that
but
what
will
it
avail
in
gaining
the
of
a
young
female
it
will
gain
the
day
experience
in
the
field
is
as
good
in
love
as
in
war
but
you
are
as
and
as
loyal
a
subject
as
the
king
can
boast
of
god
bless
him
that
may
be
too
but
i
afeared
i
too
rude
and
too
old
and
too
wild
like
to
suit
the
fancy
of
such
a
young
and
delicate
girl
as
mabel
who
has
been
unused
to
our
wilderness
ways
and
may
think
the
settlements
better
suited
to
her
gifts
and
these
are
new
misgivings
for
you
my
friend
and
i
wonder
they
were
never
paraded
because
i
never
knew
my
own
worthlessness
perhaps
until
i
saw
mabel
i
have
travelled
with
some
as
fair
and
have
guided
them
through
the
forest
and
seen
them
in
their
perils
and
in
their
gladness
but
they
were
always
too
much
above
me
to
make
me
think
of
them
as
more
than
so
many
feeble
ones
i
was
bound
to
protect
and
defend
the
case
is
now
different
mabel
and
i
are
so
nearly
alike
that
i
feel
weighed
down
with
a
load
that
is
hard
to
bear
at
finding
us
so
unlike
i
do
wish
sergeant
that
i
was
ten
years
younger
more
comely
to
look
at
and
better
suited
to
please
a
handsome
young
woman
cheer
up
my
brave
friend
and
trust
to
a
father
knowledge
of
womankind
mabel
half
loves
you
already
and
a
fortnight
intercourse
and
kindness
down
among
the
islands
yonder
will
close
ranks
with
the
other
half
the
girl
as
much
as
told
me
this
herself
last
can
this
be
so
sergeant
said
the
guide
whose
meek
and
modest
nature
shrank
from
viewing
himself
in
colors
so
favorable
can
this
be
truly
so
i
am
but
a
poor
hunter
and
mabel
i
see
is
fit
to
be
an
lady
do
you
think
the
girl
will
consent
to
quit
all
her
beloved
settlement
usages
and
her
visitings
and
to
dwell
with
a
plain
guide
and
hunter
up
hereaway
in
the
woods
will
she
not
in
the
end
crave
her
old
ways
and
a
better
man
a
better
man
pathfinder
would
be
hard
to
find
returned
the
father
as
for
town
usages
they
are
soon
forgotten
in
the
freedom
of
the
forest
and
mabel
has
just
spirit
enough
to
dwell
on
a
frontier
not
planned
this
marriage
my
friend
without
thinking
it
over
as
a
general
does
his
campaign
at
first
i
thought
of
bringing
you
into
the
regiment
that
you
might
succeed
me
when
i
retire
which
must
be
sooner
or
later
but
on
reflection
pathfinder
i
think
you
are
scarcely
fitted
for
the
office
still
if
not
a
soldier
in
all
the
meanings
of
the
word
you
are
a
soldier
in
its
best
meaning
and
i
know
that
you
have
the
of
every
officer
in
the
corps
as
long
as
i
live
mabel
can
dwell
with
me
and
you
will
always
have
a
home
when
you
return
from
your
scoutings
and
this
is
very
pleasant
to
think
of
sergeant
if
the
girl
can
only
come
into
our
wishes
with
but
ah
me
it
does
not
seem
that
one
like
myself
can
ever
be
agreeable
in
her
handsome
eyes
if
i
were
younger
and
more
comely
now
as
jasper
western
is
for
instance
there
might
be
a
chance
yes
then
indeed
there
might
be
some
that
for
jasper
and
every
younker
of
them
in
or
about
the
fort
returned
the
sergeant
snapping
his
fingers
if
not
actually
a
younger
you
are
a
ay
and
a
man
than
the
master
anan
said
pathfinder
looking
up
at
his
companion
with
an
expression
of
doubt
as
if
he
did
not
understand
his
meaning
i
say
if
not
actually
younger
in
days
and
years
you
look
more
hardy
and
like
whipcord
than
jasper
or
any
of
them
and
there
will
be
more
of
you
thirty
years
hence
than
of
all
of
them
put
together
a
good
conscience
will
keep
one
like
you
a
mere
boy
all
his
jasper
has
as
clear
a
conscience
as
any
youth
i
know
sergeant
and
is
as
likely
to
wear
on
that
account
as
any
in
the
then
you
are
my
friend
squeezing
the
other
hand
my
tried
sworn
and
constant
yes
we
have
been
friends
sergeant
near
twenty
years
before
mabel
was
true
enough
before
mabel
was
born
we
were
friends
and
the
hussy
would
never
dream
of
refusing
to
marry
a
man
who
was
her
friend
before
she
was
we
do
know
sergeant
we
do
know
like
loves
like
the
young
prefer
the
young
for
companions
and
the
old
the
not
for
wives
pathfinder
i
never
knew
an
old
man
now
who
had
an
objection
to
a
young
wife
then
you
are
respected
and
esteemed
by
every
officer
in
the
fort
as
i
have
said
already
and
it
will
please
her
fancy
to
like
a
man
that
every
one
else
i
hope
i
have
no
enemies
but
the
mingos
returned
the
guide
stroking
down
his
hair
meekly
and
speaking
thoughtfully
i
tried
to
do
right
and
that
ought
to
make
friends
though
it
sometimes
and
you
may
be
said
to
keep
the
best
company
for
even
old
duncan
of
lundie
is
glad
to
see
you
and
you
pass
hours
in
his
society
of
all
the
guides
he
confides
most
in
ay
even
greater
than
he
is
have
marched
by
my
side
for
days
and
have
conversed
with
me
as
if
i
were
their
brother
but
sergeant
i
have
never
been
puffed
up
by
their
company
for
i
know
that
the
woods
often
bring
men
to
a
level
who
would
not
be
so
in
the
and
you
are
known
to
be
the
greatest
rifle
shot
that
ever
pulled
trigger
in
all
this
if
mabel
could
fancy
a
man
for
that
i
might
have
no
great
reason
to
despair
and
yet
sergeant
i
sometimes
think
that
it
is
all
as
much
owing
to
killdeer
as
to
any
skill
of
my
own
it
is
sartainly
a
wonderful
piece
and
might
do
as
much
in
the
hands
of
that
is
your
own
humble
opinion
of
yourself
pathfinder
but
we
have
seen
too
many
fail
with
the
same
weapon
and
you
succeed
too
often
with
the
rifles
of
other
men
to
allow
me
to
agree
with
you
we
will
get
up
a
shooting
match
in
a
day
or
two
when
you
can
show
your
skill
and
when
mabel
will
form
some
judgment
concerning
your
true
will
that
be
fair
sergeant
everybody
knows
that
killdeer
seldom
misses
and
ought
we
to
make
a
trial
of
this
sort
when
we
all
know
what
must
be
the
result
tut
tut
man
i
foresee
i
must
do
half
this
courting
for
you
for
one
who
is
always
inside
of
the
smoke
in
a
skirmish
you
are
the
suitor
i
ever
met
with
remember
mabel
comes
of
a
bold
stock
and
the
girl
will
be
as
likely
to
admire
a
man
as
her
mother
was
before
here
the
sergeant
arose
and
proceeded
to
attend
to
his
duties
without
apology
the
terms
on
which
the
guide
stood
with
all
in
the
garrison
rendering
this
freedom
quite
a
matter
of
course
the
reader
will
have
gathered
from
the
conversation
just
related
one
of
the
plans
that
sergeant
dunham
had
in
view
in
causing
his
daughter
to
be
brought
to
the
frontier
although
necessarily
much
weaned
from
the
caresses
and
blandishments
that
had
rendered
his
child
so
dear
to
him
during
the
first
year
or
two
of
his
widowerhood
he
had
still
a
strong
but
somewhat
latent
love
for
her
accustomed
to
command
and
to
obey
without
being
questioned
himself
or
questioning
others
concerning
the
reasonableness
of
the
mandates
he
was
perhaps
too
much
disposed
to
believe
that
his
daughter
would
marry
the
man
he
might
select
while
he
was
far
from
being
disposed
to
do
violence
to
her
wishes
the
fact
was
few
knew
the
pathfinder
intimately
without
secretly
believing
him
to
be
one
of
extraordinary
qualities
ever
the
same
faithful
utterly
without
fear
and
yet
prudent
foremost
in
all
warrantable
enterprises
or
what
the
opinion
of
the
day
considered
as
such
and
never
engaged
in
anything
to
call
a
blush
to
his
cheek
or
censure
on
his
acts
it
was
not
possible
to
live
much
with
this
being
and
not
feel
respect
and
admiration
for
him
which
had
no
reference
to
his
position
in
life
the
most
surprising
peculiarity
about
the
man
himself
was
the
entire
indifference
with
which
he
regarded
all
distinctions
which
did
not
depend
on
personal
merit
he
was
respectful
to
his
superiors
from
habit
but
had
often
been
known
to
correct
their
mistakes
and
to
reprove
their
vices
with
a
fearlessness
that
proved
how
essentially
he
regarded
the
more
material
points
and
with
a
natural
discrimination
that
appeared
to
set
education
at
defiance
in
short
a
disbeliever
in
the
ability
of
man
to
distinguish
between
good
and
evil
without
the
aid
of
instruction
would
have
been
staggered
by
the
character
of
this
extraordinary
inhabitant
of
the
frontier
his
feelings
appeared
to
possess
the
freshness
and
nature
of
the
forest
in
which
he
passed
so
much
of
his
time
and
no
casuist
could
have
made
clearer
decisions
in
matters
relating
to
right
and
wrong
and
yet
he
was
not
without
his
prejudices
which
though
few
and
colored
by
the
character
and
usages
of
the
individual
were
and
almost
formed
a
part
of
his
nature
but
the
most
striking
feature
about
the
moral
organization
of
pathfinder
was
his
beautiful
and
unerring
sense
of
justice
this
noble
trait
and
without
it
no
man
can
be
truly
great
with
it
no
man
other
than
respectable
probably
had
its
unseen
influence
on
all
who
associated
with
him
for
the
common
and
unprincipled
brawler
of
the
camp
had
been
known
to
return
from
an
expedition
made
in
his
company
rebuked
by
his
sentiments
softened
by
his
language
and
improved
by
his
example
as
might
have
been
expected
with
so
elevated
a
quality
his
fidelity
was
like
the
immovable
rock
treachery
in
him
was
classed
among
the
things
which
are
impossible
and
as
he
seldom
retired
before
his
enemies
so
was
he
never
known
under
any
circumstances
that
admitted
of
an
alternative
to
abandon
a
friend
the
affinities
of
such
a
character
were
as
a
matter
of
course
those
of
like
for
like
his
associates
and
intimates
though
more
or
less
determined
by
chance
were
generally
of
the
highest
order
as
to
moral
propensities
for
he
appeared
to
possess
a
species
of
instinctive
discrimination
which
led
him
insensibly
to
himself
most
probably
to
cling
closest
to
those
whose
characters
would
best
reward
his
friendship
in
short
it
was
said
of
the
pathfinder
by
one
accustomed
to
study
his
fellows
that
he
was
a
fair
example
of
what
a
and
pure
man
might
be
while
untempted
by
unruly
or
ambitious
desires
and
left
to
follow
the
bias
of
his
feelings
amid
the
solitary
grandeur
and
ennobling
influences
of
a
sublime
nature
neither
led
aside
by
the
inducements
which
influence
all
to
do
evil
amid
the
incentives
of
civilization
nor
forgetful
of
the
almighty
being
whose
spirit
pervades
the
wilderness
as
well
as
the
towns
such
was
the
man
whom
sergeant
dunham
had
selected
as
the
husband
of
mabel
in
making
this
choice
he
had
not
been
as
much
governed
by
a
clear
and
judicious
view
of
the
merits
of
the
individual
perhaps
as
by
his
own
likings
still
no
one
knew
the
pathfinder
so
intimately
as
himself
without
always
conceding
to
the
honest
guide
a
high
place
in
his
esteem
on
account
of
these
very
virtues
that
his
daughter
could
find
any
serious
objections
to
the
match
the
old
soldier
did
not
apprehend
while
on
the
other
hand
he
saw
many
advantages
to
himself
in
dim
perspective
connected
with
the
decline
of
his
days
and
an
evening
of
life
passed
among
descendants
who
were
equally
dear
to
him
through
both
parents
he
had
first
made
the
proposition
to
his
friend
who
had
listened
to
it
kindly
but
who
the
sergeant
was
now
pleased
to
find
already
betrayed
a
willingness
to
come
into
his
own
views
that
was
proportioned
to
the
doubts
and
misgivings
proceeding
from
his
humble
distrust
of
himself
chapter
x
think
not
i
love
him
though
i
ask
for
him
is
but
a
peevish
boy
yet
he
talks
well
but
what
care
i
for
words
a
week
passed
in
the
usual
routine
of
a
garrison
mabel
was
becoming
used
to
a
situation
that
at
first
she
had
found
not
only
novel
but
a
little
irksome
and
the
officers
and
men
in
their
turn
gradually
familiarized
to
the
presence
of
a
young
and
blooming
girl
whose
attire
and
carriage
had
that
air
of
modest
gentility
about
them
which
she
had
obtained
in
the
family
of
her
patroness
annoyed
her
less
by
their
admiration
while
they
gratified
her
by
the
respect
which
she
was
fain
to
think
they
paid
her
on
account
of
her
father
but
which
in
truth
was
more
to
be
attributed
to
her
own
modest
but
spirited
deportment
than
to
any
deference
for
the
worthy
sergeant
acquaintances
made
in
a
forest
or
in
any
circumstances
of
unusual
excitement
soon
attain
their
limits
mabel
found
one
week
residence
at
oswego
sufficient
to
determine
her
as
to
those
with
whom
she
might
be
intimate
and
those
whom
she
ought
to
avoid
the
sort
of
neutral
position
occupied
by
her
father
who
was
not
an
officer
while
he
was
so
much
more
than
a
common
soldier
by
keeping
her
aloof
from
the
two
great
classes
of
military
life
lessened
the
number
of
those
whom
she
was
compelled
to
know
and
made
the
duty
of
decision
comparatively
easy
still
she
soon
discovered
that
there
were
a
few
even
among
those
that
could
aspire
to
a
seat
at
the
commandant
table
who
were
disposed
to
overlook
the
halbert
for
the
novelty
of
a
figure
and
of
a
pretty
winning
face
and
by
the
end
of
the
first
two
or
three
days
she
had
admirers
even
among
the
gentlemen
the
quartermaster
in
particular
a
soldier
who
had
more
than
once
tried
the
blessings
of
matrimony
already
but
was
now
a
widower
was
evidently
disposed
to
increase
his
intimacy
with
the
sergeant
though
their
duties
often
brought
them
together
and
the
youngsters
among
his
messmates
did
not
fail
to
note
that
this
man
of
method
who
was
a
scotsman
of
the
name
of
muir
was
much
more
frequent
in
his
visits
to
the
quarters
of
his
subordinate
than
had
formerly
been
his
wont
a
laugh
or
a
joke
in
honor
of
the
sergeant
daughter
however
limited
their
strictures
though
mabel
dunham
was
soon
a
toast
that
even
the
ensign
or
the
lieutenant
did
not
disdain
to
give
at
the
end
of
the
week
duncan
of
lundie
sent
for
sergeant
dunham
after
evening
on
business
of
a
nature
that
it
was
understood
required
a
personal
conference
the
old
veteran
dwelt
in
a
movable
hut
which
being
placed
on
trucks
he
could
order
to
be
wheeled
about
at
pleasure
sometimes
living
in
one
part
of
the
area
within
the
fort
and
sometimes
in
another
on
the
present
occasion
he
had
made
a
halt
near
the
centre
and
there
he
was
found
by
his
subordinate
who
was
admitted
to
his
presence
without
any
delay
or
dancing
attendance
in
an
in
point
of
fact
there
was
very
little
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
accommodations
allowed
to
the
officers
and
those
allowed
to
the
men
the
former
being
merely
granted
the
most
room
walk
in
sergeant
walk
in
my
good
friend
said
old
lundie
heartily
as
his
inferior
stood
in
a
respectful
attitude
at
the
door
of
a
sort
of
library
and
bedroom
into
which
he
had
been
ushered
walk
in
and
take
a
seat
on
that
stool
i
have
sent
for
you
man
to
discuss
anything
but
rosters
and
this
evening
it
is
now
many
years
since
we
have
been
comrades
and
lang
syne
should
count
for
something
even
between
a
major
and
his
orderly
a
scot
and
a
yankee
sit
ye
down
man
and
just
put
yourself
at
your
ease
it
has
been
a
fine
day
it
has
indeed
major
duncan
returned
the
other
who
though
he
complied
so
far
as
to
take
the
seat
was
much
too
practised
not
to
understand
the
degree
of
respect
it
was
necessary
to
maintain
in
his
manner
a
very
fine
day
sir
it
has
been
and
we
may
look
for
more
of
them
at
this
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
the
crops
look
well
as
it
is
man
and
you
be
finding
that
the
make
almost
as
good
farmers
as
soldiers
i
never
saw
better
potatoes
in
scotland
than
we
are
likely
to
have
in
that
new
patch
of
they
promise
a
good
yield
major
duncan
and
in
that
light
a
more
comfortable
winter
than
the
life
is
progressive
sergeant
in
its
comforts
as
well
as
in
its
need
of
them
we
grow
old
and
i
begin
to
think
it
time
to
retire
and
settle
in
life
i
feel
that
my
working
days
are
nearly
the
king
god
bless
him
sir
has
much
good
service
in
your
honor
it
may
be
so
sergeant
dunham
especially
if
he
should
happen
to
have
a
spare
the
will
be
honored
the
day
that
commission
is
given
to
duncan
of
lundie
and
duncan
of
lundie
will
be
honored
the
day
he
receives
it
but
sergeant
if
you
have
never
had
a
you
have
had
a
good
wife
and
that
is
the
next
thing
to
rank
in
making
a
man
i
have
been
married
major
duncan
but
it
is
now
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
no
drawback
on
the
love
i
bear
his
majesty
and
my
what
man
not
even
the
love
you
bear
that
active
little
daughter
that
i
have
seen
in
the
fort
these
last
few
days
out
upon
you
sergeant
old
fellow
as
i
am
i
could
almost
love
that
little
lassie
myself
and
send
the
to
the
we
all
know
where
major
duncan
heart
is
and
that
is
in
scotland
where
a
beautiful
lady
is
ready
and
willing
to
make
him
happy
as
soon
as
his
own
sense
of
duty
shall
ay
hope
is
ever
a
thing
sergeant
returned
the
superior
a
shade
of
melancholy
passing
over
his
hard
scottish
features
as
he
spoke
and
bonnie
scotland
is
a
country
well
if
we
have
no
heather
and
oatmeal
in
this
region
we
have
venison
for
the
killing
of
it
and
salmon
as
plenty
as
at
is
it
true
sergeant
that
the
men
complain
of
having
been
and
of
late
not
for
some
weeks
major
duncan
for
neither
deer
nor
birds
are
so
plenty
at
this
season
as
they
have
been
they
begin
to
throw
their
remarks
about
concerning
the
salmon
but
i
trust
we
shall
get
through
the
summer
without
any
serious
disturbance
on
the
score
of
food
the
scotch
in
the
battalion
do
indeed
talk
more
than
is
prudent
of
their
want
of
oatmeal
grumbling
occasionally
of
our
wheaten
ah
that
is
human
nature
sergeant
pure
unadulterated
scotch
human
nature
a
cake
man
to
say
the
truth
is
an
agreeable
morsel
and
i
often
see
the
time
when
i
pine
for
a
bite
if
the
feeling
gets
to
be
troublesome
major
duncan
in
the
men
i
mean
sir
for
i
would
not
think
of
saying
so
disrespectful
a
thing
to
your
honor
but
if
the
men
ever
pine
seriously
for
their
natural
food
i
would
humbly
recommend
that
some
oatmeal
be
imported
or
prepared
in
this
country
for
them
and
i
think
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
it
a
very
little
would
answer
for
a
cure
you
are
a
wag
sergeant
but
hang
me
if
i
am
sure
you
are
not
right
there
may
be
sweeter
things
in
this
world
after
all
than
oatmeal
you
have
a
sweet
daughter
dunham
for
the
girl
is
like
her
mother
major
duncan
and
will
pass
inspection
said
the
sergeant
proudly
neither
was
brought
up
on
anything
better
than
good
american
flour
the
girl
will
pass
inspection
that
would
she
i
answer
for
it
well
i
may
as
well
come
to
the
point
at
once
man
and
bring
up
my
reserve
into
the
front
of
the
battle
here
is
davy
muir
the
quartermaster
disposed
to
make
your
daughter
his
wife
and
he
has
just
got
me
to
open
the
matter
to
you
being
fearful
of
compromising
his
own
dignity
and
i
may
as
well
add
that
half
the
youngsters
in
the
fort
toast
her
and
talk
of
her
from
morning
till
she
is
much
honored
sir
returned
the
father
stiffly
but
i
trust
the
gentlemen
will
find
something
more
worthy
of
them
to
talk
about
ere
long
i
hope
to
see
her
the
wife
of
an
honest
man
before
many
weeks
yes
davy
is
an
honest
man
and
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
all
in
the
quartermaster
department
i
thinking
sergeant
returned
lundie
with
a
slight
smile
well
then
may
i
tell
the
youth
that
the
matter
is
as
good
as
settled
i
thank
your
honor
but
mabel
is
betrothed
to
the
devil
she
is
that
will
produce
a
stir
in
the
fort
though
i
not
sorry
to
hear
it
either
for
to
be
frank
with
you
sergeant
i
no
great
admirer
of
unequal
i
think
with
your
honor
and
have
no
desire
to
see
my
daughter
an
officer
lady
if
she
can
get
as
high
as
her
mother
was
before
her
it
ought
to
satisfy
any
reasonable
and
may
i
ask
sergeant
who
is
the
lucky
man
that
you
intend
to
call
the
pathfinder
your
pathfinder
the
same
major
duncan
and
in
naming
him
to
you
i
give
you
his
whole
history
no
one
is
better
known
on
this
frontier
than
my
honest
brave
all
that
is
true
enough
but
is
he
after
all
the
sort
of
person
to
make
a
girl
of
twenty
happy
why
not
your
honor
the
man
is
at
the
head
of
his
calling
there
is
no
other
guide
or
scout
connected
with
the
army
who
has
half
the
reputation
of
pathfinder
or
who
deserves
to
have
it
half
as
very
true
sergeant
but
is
the
reputation
of
a
scout
exactly
the
sort
of
renown
to
captivate
a
girl
fancy
talking
of
girls
fancies
sir
is
in
my
humble
opinion
much
like
talking
of
a
recruit
judgment
if
we
were
to
take
the
movements
of
the
awkward
squad
sir
as
a
guide
we
should
never
form
a
decent
line
in
battalion
major
but
your
daughter
has
nothing
awkward
about
her
for
a
genteeler
girl
of
her
class
could
not
be
found
in
old
albion
itself
is
she
of
your
way
of
thinking
in
this
matter
though
i
suppose
she
must
be
as
you
say
she
is
we
have
not
yet
conversed
on
the
subject
your
honor
but
i
consider
her
mind
as
good
as
made
up
from
several
little
circumstances
which
might
be
and
what
are
these
circumstances
sergeant
asked
the
major
who
began
to
take
more
interest
than
he
had
at
first
felt
on
the
subject
i
confess
a
little
curiosity
to
know
something
about
a
woman
mind
being
as
you
know
a
bachelor
why
your
honor
when
i
speak
of
the
pathfinder
to
the
girl
she
always
looks
me
full
in
the
face
chimes
in
with
everything
i
say
in
his
favor
and
has
a
frank
open
way
with
her
which
says
as
much
as
if
she
half
considered
him
already
as
a
hum
and
these
signs
you
think
dunham
are
faithful
tokens
of
your
daughter
feelings
i
do
your
honor
for
they
strike
me
as
natural
when
i
find
a
man
sir
who
looks
me
full
in
the
face
while
he
praises
an
officer
for
begging
your
honor
pardon
the
men
will
sometimes
pass
their
strictures
on
their
betters
and
when
i
find
a
man
looking
me
in
the
eyes
as
he
praises
his
captain
i
always
set
it
down
that
the
fellow
is
honest
and
means
what
he
is
there
not
some
material
difference
in
the
age
of
the
intended
bridegroom
and
that
of
his
pretty
bride
sergeant
you
are
quite
right
sir
pathfinder
is
well
advanced
towards
forty
and
mabel
has
every
prospect
of
happiness
that
a
young
woman
can
derive
from
the
certainty
of
possessing
an
experienced
husband
i
was
quite
forty
myself
your
honor
when
i
married
her
but
will
your
daughter
be
as
likely
to
admire
a
green
such
as
that
our
worthy
guide
wears
with
a
cap
as
the
smart
uniform
of
the
perhaps
not
sir
and
therefore
she
will
have
the
merit
of
which
always
makes
a
young
woman
wiser
and
and
are
you
not
afraid
that
she
may
be
left
a
widow
while
still
a
young
woman
what
between
wild
beasts
and
wilder
savages
pathfinder
may
be
said
to
carry
his
life
in
his
bullet
has
its
billet
lundie
for
so
the
major
was
fond
of
being
called
in
his
moments
of
condescension
and
when
not
engaged
in
military
affairs
and
no
man
in
the
can
call
himself
beyond
or
above
the
chances
of
sudden
death
in
that
particular
mabel
would
gain
nothing
by
a
change
besides
sir
if
i
may
speak
freely
on
such
a
subject
i
much
doubt
if
ever
pathfinder
dies
in
battle
or
by
any
of
the
sudden
chances
of
the
and
why
so
sergeant
asked
the
major
he
is
a
soldier
so
far
as
danger
is
concerned
and
one
that
is
much
more
than
usually
exposed
and
being
free
of
his
person
why
should
he
expect
to
escape
when
others
do
not
i
do
not
believe
your
honor
that
the
pathfinder
considers
his
own
chances
better
than
any
one
else
but
the
man
will
never
die
by
a
bullet
i
have
seen
him
so
often
handling
his
rifle
with
as
much
composure
as
if
it
were
a
shepherd
crook
in
the
midst
of
the
heaviest
showers
of
bullets
and
under
so
many
extraordinary
circumstances
that
i
do
not
think
providence
means
he
should
ever
fall
in
that
manner
and
yet
if
there
be
a
man
in
his
majesty
dominions
who
really
deserves
such
a
death
it
is
we
never
know
sergeant
returned
lundie
with
a
countenance
grave
with
thought
and
the
less
we
say
about
it
perhaps
the
better
but
will
your
daughter
mabel
i
think
you
call
her
will
mabel
be
as
willing
to
accept
one
who
after
all
is
a
mere
of
the
army
as
to
take
one
from
the
service
itself
there
is
no
hope
of
promotion
for
the
guide
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
corps
already
your
honor
in
short
mabel
has
made
up
her
mind
on
this
subject
and
as
your
honor
has
had
the
condescension
to
speak
to
me
about
muir
i
trust
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
say
that
the
girl
is
as
good
as
billeted
for
well
well
this
is
your
own
matter
and
now
sergeant
dunham
your
honor
said
the
other
rising
and
giving
the
customary
salute
you
have
been
told
it
is
my
intention
to
send
you
down
among
the
thousand
islands
for
the
next
month
all
the
old
subalterns
have
had
their
tours
of
duty
in
that
quarter
all
that
i
like
to
trust
at
least
and
it
has
at
length
come
to
your
turn
lieutenant
muir
it
is
true
claims
his
right
but
being
quartermaster
i
do
not
like
to
break
up
arrangements
are
the
men
drafted
everything
is
ready
your
honor
the
draft
is
made
and
i
understood
that
the
canoe
which
got
in
last
night
brought
a
message
to
say
that
the
party
already
below
is
looking
out
for
the
it
did
and
you
must
sail
the
day
after
if
not
night
it
will
be
wise
perhaps
to
sail
in
the
so
jasper
thinks
major
duncan
and
i
know
no
one
more
to
be
depended
on
in
such
an
affair
than
young
jasper
young
jasper
said
lundie
a
slight
smile
gathering
around
his
usually
stern
mouth
will
that
lad
be
of
your
party
sergeant
your
honor
will
remember
that
the
never
quits
port
without
true
but
all
general
rules
have
their
exceptions
have
i
not
seen
a
seafaring
person
about
the
fort
within
the
last
few
days
no
doubt
your
honor
it
is
master
cap
a
of
mine
who
brought
my
daughter
from
why
not
put
him
in
the
for
this
cruise
sergeant
and
leave
jasper
behind
your
would
like
the
variety
of
a
cruise
and
you
would
enjoy
more
of
his
i
intended
to
ask
your
honor
permission
to
take
him
along
but
he
must
go
as
a
volunteer
jasper
is
too
brave
a
lad
to
be
turned
out
of
his
command
without
a
reason
major
duncan
and
i
afraid
brother
cap
despises
fresh
water
too
much
to
do
duty
on
quite
right
sergeant
and
i
leave
all
this
to
your
own
discretion
must
retain
his
command
on
second
thoughts
you
intend
that
pathfinder
shall
also
be
of
the
party
if
your
honor
approves
of
it
there
will
be
service
for
both
the
guides
the
indian
as
well
as
the
white
i
think
you
are
right
well
sergeant
i
wish
you
good
luck
in
the
enterprise
and
remember
the
post
is
to
be
destroyed
and
abandoned
when
your
command
is
withdrawn
it
will
have
done
its
work
by
that
time
or
we
shall
have
failed
entirely
and
it
is
too
ticklish
a
position
to
be
maintained
unnecessarily
you
can
sergeant
dunham
gave
the
customary
salute
turned
on
his
heels
as
if
they
had
been
pivots
and
had
got
the
door
nearly
drawn
to
after
him
when
he
was
suddenly
recalled
i
had
forgotten
sergeant
the
younger
officers
have
begged
for
a
shooting
match
and
has
been
named
for
the
day
all
competitors
will
be
admitted
and
the
prizes
will
be
a
powder
horn
a
leathern
flask
ditto
reading
from
a
piece
of
paper
as
i
see
by
the
professional
jargon
of
this
bill
and
a
silk
calash
for
a
lady
the
latter
is
to
enable
the
victor
to
show
his
gallantry
by
making
an
offering
of
it
to
her
he
best
all
very
agreeable
your
honor
at
least
to
him
that
succeeds
is
the
pathfinder
to
be
permitted
to
enter
i
do
not
well
see
how
he
can
be
excluded
if
he
choose
to
come
forward
latterly
i
have
observed
that
he
takes
no
share
in
these
sports
probably
from
a
conviction
of
his
own
unequalled
that
it
major
duncan
the
honest
fellow
knows
there
is
not
a
man
on
the
frontier
who
can
equal
him
and
he
does
not
wish
to
spoil
the
pleasure
of
others
i
think
we
may
trust
to
his
delicacy
in
anything
sir
perhaps
it
may
be
as
well
to
let
him
have
his
own
way
in
this
instance
we
must
sergeant
whether
he
will
be
as
successful
in
all
others
remains
to
be
seen
i
wish
you
good
evening
the
sergeant
now
withdrew
leaving
duncan
of
lundie
to
his
own
thoughts
that
they
were
not
altogether
disagreeable
was
to
be
inferred
from
the
smiles
which
occasionally
covered
a
countenance
hard
and
martial
in
its
usual
expression
though
there
were
moments
in
which
all
its
severe
sobriety
prevailed
half
an
hour
might
have
passed
when
a
tap
at
the
door
was
answered
by
a
direction
to
enter
a
man
in
the
dress
of
an
officer
but
whose
uniform
wanted
the
usual
smartness
of
the
profession
made
his
appearance
and
was
saluted
as
mr
i
have
come
sir
at
your
bidding
to
know
my
fortune
said
the
quartermaster
in
a
strong
scotch
accent
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
the
seat
which
was
proffered
to
him
to
say
the
truth
to
you
major
duncan
this
girl
is
making
as
much
havoc
in
the
garrison
as
the
french
did
before
ty
i
never
witnessed
so
general
a
rout
in
so
short
a
time
surely
davy
you
do
mean
to
persuade
me
that
your
young
and
unsophisticated
heart
is
in
such
a
flame
after
one
week
ignition
why
man
this
is
worse
than
the
affair
in
scotland
where
it
was
said
the
heat
within
was
so
intense
that
it
just
burnt
a
hole
through
your
own
precious
body
and
left
a
place
for
all
the
lassies
to
peer
in
at
to
see
what
the
combustible
material
was
ye
have
your
own
way
major
duncan
and
your
father
and
mother
would
have
theirs
before
ye
even
if
the
enemy
were
in
the
camp
i
see
nothing
so
extraordinar
in
young
people
following
the
bent
of
their
inclinations
and
but
you
followed
yours
so
often
davy
that
i
should
think
by
this
time
it
had
lost
the
edge
of
novelty
including
that
informal
affair
in
scotland
when
you
were
a
lad
you
been
married
four
times
only
three
major
as
i
hope
to
get
another
wife
i
not
yet
had
my
number
no
no
only
i
thinking
davy
you
do
include
the
first
affair
i
mentioned
that
in
which
there
was
no
and
why
should
i
major
the
courts
decided
that
it
was
no
marriage
and
what
more
could
a
man
want
the
woman
took
advantage
of
a
slight
amorous
propensity
that
may
be
a
weakness
in
my
disposition
perhaps
and
inveigled
me
into
a
contract
which
was
found
to
be
if
i
remember
right
muir
there
were
thought
to
be
two
sides
to
that
question
in
the
time
of
it
it
would
be
but
an
indifferent
question
my
dear
major
that
had
two
sides
to
it
and
i
known
many
that
had
three
but
the
poor
dead
and
there
was
no
issue
so
nothing
came
of
it
after
all
then
i
was
particularly
unfortunate
with
my
second
wife
i
say
second
major
out
of
deference
to
you
and
on
the
mere
supposition
that
the
first
was
a
marriage
at
all
but
first
or
second
i
was
particularly
unfortunate
with
jeannie
graham
who
died
in
the
first
lustrum
leaving
neither
chick
nor
chiel
behind
her
i
do
think
if
jeannie
had
survived
i
never
should
have
turned
my
thoughts
towards
another
but
as
she
did
not
you
married
twice
after
her
death
and
are
desirous
of
doing
so
a
third
the
truth
can
never
justly
be
gainsaid
major
duncan
and
i
am
always
ready
to
avow
it
i
thinking
lundie
you
are
melancholar
this
fine
evening
no
muir
not
melancholy
absolutely
but
a
little
thoughtful
i
confess
i
was
looking
back
to
my
boyish
days
when
i
the
laird
son
and
you
the
parson
roamed
about
our
native
hills
happy
and
careless
boys
taking
little
heed
to
the
future
and
then
have
followed
some
thoughts
that
may
be
a
little
painful
concerning
that
future
as
it
has
turned
out
to
surely
lundie
ye
do
not
complain
of
yer
portion
of
it
you
risen
to
be
a
major
and
will
soon
be
a
if
letters
tell
the
truth
while
i
am
just
one
step
higher
than
when
your
honored
father
gave
me
my
first
commission
and
a
poor
deevil
of
a
and
the
four
wives
three
lundie
three
only
that
were
legal
even
under
our
own
liberal
and
sanctified
well
then
let
it
be
three
ye
know
davy
said
major
duncan
insensibly
dropping
into
the
pronunciation
and
dialect
of
his
youth
as
is
much
the
practice
with
educated
scotchmen
as
they
warm
with
a
subject
that
comes
near
the
heart
ye
know
davy
that
my
own
choice
has
long
been
made
and
in
how
anxious
and
a
manner
i
waited
for
that
happy
hour
when
i
can
call
the
woman
i
so
long
loved
a
wife
and
here
have
you
without
fortune
name
birth
or
merit
i
mean
particular
merit
na
na
dinna
say
that
lundie
the
muirs
are
of
gude
well
then
without
aught
but
bluid
ye
wived
four
times
i
tall
ye
but
thrice
lundie
ye
weaken
auld
friendship
if
ye
call
it
put
it
at
yer
own
number
davy
and
it
far
more
than
yer
share
our
lives
have
been
very
different
on
the
score
of
matrimony
at
least
you
must
allow
that
my
old
and
which
do
you
think
has
been
the
gainer
major
speaking
as
frankly
thegither
as
we
did
when
lads
nay
i
nothing
to
conceal
my
days
have
passed
in
hope
deferred
while
yours
have
passed
in
not
in
hope
realized
i
give
you
mine
honor
major
duncan
interrupted
the
quartermaster
each
new
experiment
i
have
thought
might
prove
an
advantage
but
disappointment
seems
the
lot
of
man
ah
this
is
a
vain
world
of
ours
lundie
it
must
be
owned
and
in
nothing
vainer
than
in
and
yet
you
are
ready
to
put
your
neck
into
the
noose
for
the
fifth
time
i
desire
to
say
it
will
be
but
the
fourth
major
duncan
said
the
quartermaster
positively
then
instantly
changing
the
expression
of
his
face
to
one
of
boyish
rapture
he
added
but
this
mabel
dunham
is
a
avis
our
scotch
lassies
are
fair
and
pleasant
but
it
must
be
owned
these
colonials
are
of
surpassing
you
will
do
well
to
recollect
your
commission
and
blood
davy
i
believe
all
four
of
your
wives
i
wish
my
dear
lundie
ye
be
more
accurate
in
yer
arithmetic
three
times
one
make
all
three
then
were
what
might
be
termed
gentlewomen
that
just
it
major
three
were
gentlewomen
as
you
say
and
the
connections
were
and
the
fourth
being
the
daughter
of
my
father
gardener
the
connection
was
unsuitable
but
have
you
no
fear
that
marrying
the
child
of
a
officer
who
is
in
the
same
corps
with
yourself
will
have
the
effect
to
lessen
your
consequence
in
the
regiment
that
just
been
my
weakness
through
life
major
duncan
for
always
married
without
regard
to
consequences
every
man
has
his
besetting
sin
and
matrimony
i
fear
is
mine
and
now
that
we
have
discussed
what
may
be
called
the
principles
of
the
connection
i
will
just
ask
if
you
did
me
the
favor
to
speak
to
the
sergeant
on
the
trifling
affair
i
did
david
and
am
sorry
to
say
for
your
hopes
that
i
see
no
great
chance
of
your
not
succeeding
an
officer
and
a
quartermaster
in
the
bargain
and
not
succeed
with
a
sergeant
daughter
it
just
that
and
why
not
lundie
will
ye
have
the
goodness
to
answer
just
that
the
girl
is
betrothed
hand
plighted
word
passed
love
pledged
no
hang
me
if
i
believe
that
either
but
she
is
well
that
an
obstacle
it
must
be
avowed
major
though
it
counts
for
little
if
the
heart
is
quite
true
and
i
think
it
probable
the
heart
is
free
in
this
case
for
the
intended
husband
appears
to
be
the
choice
of
the
father
rather
than
of
the
and
who
may
it
be
major
asked
the
quartermaster
who
viewed
the
whole
matter
with
the
philosophy
and
coolness
acquired
by
use
i
do
not
recollect
any
plausible
suitor
that
is
likely
to
stand
in
my
no
you
are
the
only
suitor
on
the
frontier
davy
the
happy
man
is
pathfinder
major
duncan
no
more
nor
any
less
david
muir
pathfinder
is
the
man
but
it
may
relieve
your
jealousy
a
little
to
know
that
in
my
judgment
at
least
it
is
a
match
of
the
father
rather
than
of
the
daughter
i
thought
as
much
exclaimed
the
quartermaster
drawing
a
long
breath
like
one
who
felt
relieved
it
quite
impossible
that
with
my
experience
in
human
nature
particularly
nature
ye
will
have
yer
joke
lundie
let
who
will
suffer
but
i
did
not
think
it
possible
i
could
be
deceived
as
to
the
young
woman
inclinations
which
i
think
i
may
boldly
pronounce
to
be
altogether
above
the
condition
of
pathfinder
as
for
the
individual
himself
why
time
will
now
tell
me
frankly
davy
muir
said
lundie
stepping
short
in
his
walk
and
looking
the
other
earnestly
in
the
face
with
a
comical
expression
of
surprise
that
rendered
the
veteran
countenance
ridiculously
earnest
do
you
really
suppose
a
girl
like
the
daughter
of
sergeant
dunham
can
take
a
serious
fancy
to
a
man
of
your
years
and
appearance
and
experience
i
might
add
hout
awa
lundie
ye
dinna
know
the
sax
and
that
the
reason
yer
unmarried
in
yer
year
it
a
fearfu

been
a
bachelor

and
what
may
be

age

muir
if
i
may
presume
to
ask
so
delicate
a
question
i
no
deny
it
lundie
and
if
i
get
mabel
there
be
just
a
wife
for
every
twa
lustrums
but
i
didna
think
sergeant
dunham
would
be
so
humble
minded
as
to
dream
of
giving
that
sweet
lass
of
his
to
one
like
the
there
no
dream
about
it
davy
the
man
is
as
serious
as
a
soldier
about
to
be
well
well
major
we
are
auld
friends
both
ran
into
the
scotch
or
avoided
it
as
they
approached
or
drew
away
from
their
younger
days
in
the
dialogue
and
ought
to
know
how
to
take
and
give
a
joke
off
duty
it
is
possible
the
worthy
man
has
not
understood
my
hints
or
he
never
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
the
difference
between
an
consort
and
a
guide
woman
is
as
vast
as
that
between
the
antiquity
of
scotland
and
the
antiquity
of
america
i
auld
blood
too
take
my
word
for
it
davy
your
antiquity
will
do
you
no
good
in
this
affair
and
as
for
your
blood
it
is
not
older
than
your
bones
well
well
man
ye
know
the
sergeant
answer
and
so
ye
perceive
that
my
influence
on
which
ye
counted
so
much
can
do
nought
for
ye
let
us
take
a
glass
thegither
davy
for
auld
acquaintance
sake
and
then
be
doing
well
to
remember
the
party
that
marches
the
morrow
and
to
forget
mabel
dunham
as
fast
as
ever
you
ah
major
i
have
always
found
it
easier
to
forget
a
wife
than
to
forget
a
sweetheart
when
a
couple
are
fairly
married
all
is
settled
but
the
death
as
one
may
say
which
must
finally
part
us
all
and
it
seems
to
me
awfu
irreverent
to
disturb
the
departed
whereas
there
is
so
much
anxiety
and
hope
and
felicity
in
expectation
like
with
the
lassie
that
it
keeps
thought
that
is
just
my
idea
of
your
situation
davy
for
i
never
supposed
you
expected
any
more
felicity
with
either
of
your
wives
now
i
heard
of
fellows
who
were
so
stupid
as
to
look
forward
to
happiness
with
their
wives
even
beyond
the
grave
i
drink
to
your
success
or
to
your
speedy
recovery
from
this
attack
lieutenant
and
i
admonish
you
to
be
more
cautious
in
future
as
some
of
these
violent
cases
may
yet
carry
you
many
thanks
dear
major
and
a
speedy
termination
to
an
old
courtship
of
which
i
know
something
this
is
real
mountain
dew
lundie
and
it
warms
the
heart
like
a
gleam
of
bonnie
scotland
as
for
the
men
just
mentioned
they
could
have
had
but
one
wife
a
piece
for
where
there
are
several
the
deeds
of
the
women
themselves
may
carry
them
different
ways
i
think
a
reasonable
husband
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
passing
his
allotted
time
with
any
particular
wife
in
this
world
and
not
to
go
about
moping
for
things
unattainable
i
infinitely
obliged
to
you
major
duncan
for
this
and
all
your
other
acts
of
friendship
and
if
you
could
but
add
another
i
should
think
you
had
not
altogether
forgotten
the
of
your
well
davy
if
the
request
be
reasonable
and
such
as
a
superior
ought
to
grant
out
with
it
if
ye
could
only
contrive
a
little
service
for
me
down
among
the
thousand
isles
for
a
fortnight
or
so
i
think
this
matter
might
be
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
just
remember
lundie
the
lassie
is
the
only
marriageable
white
female
on
this
there
is
always
duty
for
one
in
your
line
at
a
post
however
small
but
this
below
can
be
done
by
the
sergeant
as
well
as
by
the
and
better
but
not
better
than
by
a
regimental
officer
there
is
great
waste
in
common
among
the
i
think
of
it
muir
said
the
major
laughing
and
you
shall
have
my
answer
in
the
morning
here
will
be
a
fine
occasion
man
the
morrow
to
show
yourself
off
before
the
lady
you
are
expert
with
the
rifle
and
prizes
are
to
be
won
make
up
your
mind
to
display
your
skill
and
who
knows
what
may
yet
happen
before
the
i
thinking
most
of
the
young
men
will
try
their
hands
in
this
sport
major
that
will
they
and
some
of
the
old
ones
too
if
you
appear
to
keep
you
in
countenance
i
try
a
shot
or
two
myself
davy
and
you
know
i
have
some
name
that
it
might
indeed
do
good
the
female
heart
major
duncan
is
susceptible
in
many
different
modes
and
sometimes
in
a
way
that
the
rules
of
philosophy
might
reject
some
require
a
suitor
to
sit
down
before
them
as
it
might
be
in
a
regular
siege
and
only
capitulate
when
the
place
can
hold
out
no
longer
others
again
like
to
be
carried
by
storm
while
there
are
hussies
who
can
only
be
caught
by
leading
them
into
an
ambush
the
first
is
the
most
creditable
and
process
perhaps
but
i
must
say
i
think
the
last
the
most
an
opinion
formed
from
experience
out
of
all
question
and
what
of
the
storming
parties
they
may
do
for
younger
men
lundie
returned
the
quartermaster
rising
and
winking
a
liberty
that
he
often
took
with
his
commanding
officer
on
the
score
of
a
long
intimacy
every
period
of
life
has
its
necessities
and
at
it
just
as
well
to
trust
a
little
to
the
head
i
wish
you
a
very
good
even
major
duncan
and
freedom
from
gout
with
a
sweet
and
refreshing
the
same
to
yourself
muir
with
many
thanks
remember
the
passage
of
arms
for
the
the
quartermaster
withdrew
leaving
lundie
in
his
library
to
reflect
on
what
had
just
passed
use
had
so
accustomed
major
duncan
to
lieutenant
muir
and
all
his
traits
and
humors
that
the
conduct
of
the
latter
did
not
strike
the
former
with
the
same
force
as
it
will
probably
the
reader
in
truth
while
all
men
act
under
one
common
law
that
is
termed
nature
the
varieties
in
their
dispositions
modes
of
judging
feelings
and
selfishness
are

so
completely
as
the
wishes
of
the
young
men
of
the
garrison
were
met
by
the
state
of
the
weather
on
the
succeeding
day
the
heats
of
summer
were

felt
at
oswego

are

far
reduced
the
influence
of
the
sun
as
to
render
the
nights
always
cool
and
the
days
seldom
oppressive
it
was
now
september
a
month
in
which
the
strong
gales
of
the
coast
often
appear
to
force
themselves
across
the
country
as
far
as
the
great
lakes
where
the
inland
sailor
sometimes
feels
that
genial
influence
which
characterizes
the
winds
of
the
ocean
invigorating
his
frame
cheering
his
spirits
and
arousing
his
moral
force
such
a
day
was
that
on
which
the
garrison
of
oswego
assembled
to
witness
what
its
commander
had
jocularly
called
a
passage
of
lundie
was
a
scholar
in
military
matters
at
least
and
it
was
one
of
his
sources
of
honest
pride
to
direct
the
reading
and
thoughts
of
the
young
men
under
his
orders
to
the
more
intellectual
parts
of
their
profession
for
one
in
his
situation
his
library
was
both
good
and
extensive
and
its
books
were
freely
lent
to
all
who
desired
to
use
them
among
other
whims
that
had
found
their
way
into
the
garrison
through
these
means
was
a
relish
for
the
sort
of
amusement
in
which
it
was
now
about
to
indulge
and
around
which
some
chronicles
of
the
days
of
chivalry
had
induced
them
to
throw
a
parade
and
romance
not
unsuited
to
the
characters
and
habits
of
soldiers
or
to
the
insulated
and
wild
post
occupied
by
this
particular
garrison
while
so
earnestly
bent
on
pleasure
however
they
on
whom
that
duty
devolved
did
not
neglect
the
safety
of
the
garrison
one
standing
on
the
ramparts
of
the
fort
and
gazing
on
the
waste
of
glittering
water
that
bounded
the
view
all
along
the
northern
horizon
and
on
the
slumbering
and
seemingly
boundless
forest
which
filled
the
other
half
of
the
panorama
would
have
fancied
the
spot
the
very
abode
of
peacefulness
and
security
but
duncan
of
lundie
too
well
knew
that
the
woods
might
at
any
moment
give
up
their
hundreds
bent
on
the
destruction
of
the
fort
and
all
it
contained
and
that
even
the
treacherous
lake
offered
a
highway
of
easy
approach
by
which
his
more
civilized
and
scarcely
less
wily
foes
the
french
could
come
upon
him
at
an
unguarded
moment
parties
were
sent
out
under
old
and
vigilant
officers
men
who
cared
little
for
the
sports
of
the
day
to
scour
the
forest
and
one
entire
company
held
the
fort
under
arms
with
orders
to
maintain
a
vigilance
as
strict
as
if
an
enemy
of
superior
force
was
known
to
be
near
with
these
precautions
the
remainder
of
the
officers
and
men
abandoned
themselves
without
apprehension
to
the
business
of
the
morning
the
spot
selected
for
the
sports
was
a
sort
of
esplanade
a
little
west
of
the
fort
and
on
the
immediate
bank
of
the
lake
it
had
been
cleared
of
its
trees
and
stumps
that
it
might
answer
the
purpose
of
a
as
it
possessed
the
advantages
of
having
its
rear
protected
by
the
water
and
one
of
its
flanks
by
the
works
men
drilling
on
it
could
be
attacked
consequently
on
two
sides
only
and
as
the
cleared
space
beyond
it
in
the
direction
of
the
west
and
south
was
large
any
assailants
would
be
compelled
to
quit
the
cover
of
the
woods
before
they
could
make
an
approach
sufficiently
near
to
render
them
dangerous
although
the
regular
arms
of
the
regiment
were
muskets
some
fifty
rifles
were
produced
on
the
present
occasion
every
officer
had
one
as
a
part
of
his
private
provision
for
amusement
many
belonged
to
the
scouts
and
friendly
indians
of
whom
more
or
less
were
always
hanging
about
the
fort
and
there
was
a
public
provision
of
them
for
the
use
of
those
who
followed
the
game
with
the
express
object
of
obtaining
supplies
among
those
who
carried
the
weapon
were
some
five
or
six
who
had
reputation
for
knowing
how
to
use
it
particularly
well
so
well
indeed
as
to
have
given
them
a
celebrity
on
the
frontier
twice
that
number
who
were
believed
to
be
much
better
than
common
and
many
who
would
have
been
thought
expert
in
almost
any
situation
but
the
precise
one
in
which
they
now
happened
to
be
placed
the
distance
was
a
hundred
yards
and
the
weapon
was
to
be
used
without
a
rest
the
target
a
board
with
the
customary
circular
lines
in
white
paint
having
the
in
the
centre
the
first
trials
in
skill
commenced
with
challenges
among
the
more
ignoble
of
the
competitors
to
display
their
steadiness
and
dexterity
in
idle
competition
none
but
the
common
men
engaged
in
this
strife
which
had
little
to
interest
the
spectators
among
whom
no
officer
had
yet
appeared
most
of
the
soldiers
were
scotch
the
regiment
having
been
raised
at
stirling
and
its
vicinity
not
many
years
before
though
as
in
the
case
of
sergeant
dunham
many
americans
had
joined
it
since
its
arrival
in
the
colonies
as
a
matter
of
course
the
provincials
were
generally
the
most
expert
marksmen
and
after
a
desultory
trial
of
half
an
hour
it
was
necessarily
conceded
that
a
youth
who
had
been
born
in
the
colony
of
new
york
and
who
coming
of
dutch
extraction
was
the
most
expert
of
all
who
had
yet
tried
their
skill
it
was
just
as
this
opinion
prevailed
that
the
oldest
captain
accompanied
by
most
of
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
the
fort
appeared
on
the
parade
a
train
of
some
twenty
females
of
humbler
condition
followed
among
whom
was
seen
the
form
intelligent
blooming
animated
countenance
and
neat
becoming
attire
of
mabel
dunham
of
females
who
were
officially
recognized
as
belonging
to
the
class
of
ladies
there
were
but
three
in
the
fort
all
of
whom
were
wives
mabel
being
strictly
as
had
been
stated
by
the
quartermaster
the
only
real
candidate
for
matrimony
among
her
sex
some
little
preparation
had
been
made
for
the
proper
reception
of
the
females
who
were
placed
on
a
low
staging
of
planks
near
the
immediate
bank
of
the
lake
in
this
vicinity
the
prizes
were
suspended
from
a
post
great
care
was
taken
to
reserve
the
front
seat
of
the
stage
for
the
three
ladies
and
their
children
while
mabel
and
those
who
belonged
to
the
officers
of
the
regiment
occupied
the
second
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
privates
were
huddled
together
in
the
rear
some
standing
and
some
sitting
as
they
could
find
room
mabel
who
had
already
been
admitted
to
the
society
of
the
officers
wives
on
the
footing
of
a
humble
companion
was
a
good
deal
noticed
by
the
ladies
in
front
who
had
a
proper
appreciation
of
modest
and
gentle
refinement
though
they
were
all
fully
aware
of
the
value
of
rank
more
particularly
in
a
garrison
as
soon
as
this
important
portion
of
the
spectators
had
got
into
their
places
lundie
gave
orders
for
the
trial
of
skill
to
proceed
in
the
manner
that
had
been
prescribed
in
his
previous
orders
some
eight
or
ten
of
the
best
marksmen
of
the
garrison
now
took
possession
of
the
stand
and
began
to
fire
in
succession
among
them
were
officers
and
men
indiscriminately
placed
nor
were
the
casual
visitors
in
the
fort
excluded
from
the
competition
as
might
have
been
expected
of
men
whose
amusements
and
comfortable
subsistence
equally
depended
on
skill
in
the
use
of
their
weapons
it
was
soon
found
that
they
were
all
sufficiently
expert
to
hit
the
or
the
white
spot
in
the
centre
of
the
target
others
who
succeeded
them
it
is
true
were
less
sure
their
bullets
striking
in
the
different
circles
that
surrounded
the
centre
of
the
target
without
touching
it
according
to
the
rules
of
the
day
none
could
proceed
to
the
second
trial
who
had
failed
in
the
first
and
the
adjutant
of
the
place
who
acted
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
or
marshal
of
the
day
called
upon
the
successful
adventurers
by
name
to
get
ready
for
the
next
effort
while
he
gave
notice
that
those
who
failed
to
present
themselves
for
the
shot
at
the
would
necessarily
be
excluded
from
all
the
higher
trials
just
at
this
moment
lundie
the
quartermaster
and
jasper
appeared
in
the
group
at
the
stand
while
the
pathfinder
walked
leisurely
on
the
ground
without
his
beloved
rifle
for
him
a
measure
so
unusual
as
to
be
understood
by
all
present
as
a
proof
that
he
did
not
consider
himself
a
competitor
for
the
honors
of
the
day
all
made
way
for
major
duncan
who
as
he
approached
the
stand
in
a
way
took
his
station
levelled
his
rifle
carelessly
and
fired
the
bullet
missed
the
required
mark
by
several
inches
major
duncan
is
excluded
from
the
other
trials
proclaimed
the
adjutant
in
a
voice
so
strong
and
confident
that
all
the
elder
officers
and
the
sergeants
well
understood
that
this
failure
was
preconcerted
while
all
the
younger
gentlemen
and
the
privates
felt
new
encouragement
to
proceed
on
account
of
the
evident
impartiality
with
which
the
laws
of
the
sports
were
administered
now
master
comes
your
turn
said
muir
and
if
you
do
not
beat
the
major
i
shall
say
that
your
hand
is
better
skilled
with
the
oar
than
with
the
jasper
handsome
face
flushed
he
stepped
upon
the
stand
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
mabel
whose
pretty
form
he
ascertained
was
bending
eagerly
forward
as
if
to
note
the
result
dropped
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
with
but
little
apparent
care
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
raised
the
muzzle
for
a
single
instant
with
exceeding
steadiness
and
fired
the
bullet
passed
directly
through
the
centre
of
the
much
the
best
shot
of
the
morning
since
the
others
had
merely
touched
the
paint
well
performed
master
jasper
said
muir
as
soon
as
the
result
was
declared
and
a
shot
that
might
have
done
credit
to
an
older
head
and
a
more
experienced
eye
i
thinking
notwithstanding
there
was
some
of
a
youngster
luck
in
it
for
ye
were
no
in
the
aim
ye
took
ye
may
be
quick
in
the
movement
but
yer
not
philosophic
nor
scientific
in
yer
management
of
the
weepon
now
sergeant
dunham
thank
you
to
request
the
ladies
to
give
a
closer
attention
than
common
for
i
about
to
make
that
use
of
the
rifle
which
may
be
called
the
intellectual
jasper
would
have
killed
i
allow
but
then
there
would
not
have
been
half
the
satisfaction
in
receiving
such
a
shot
as
in
receiving
one
that
is
discharged
all
this
time
the
quartermaster
was
preparing
himself
for
the
scientific
trial
but
he
delayed
his
aim
until
he
saw
that
the
eye
of
mabel
in
common
with
those
of
her
companions
was
fastened
on
him
in
curiosity
as
the
others
left
him
room
out
of
respect
to
his
rank
no
one
stood
near
the
competitor
but
his
commanding
officer
to
whom
he
now
said
in
his
familiar
manner
ye
see
lundie
that
something
is
to
be
gained
by
exciting
a
curiosity
it
an
active
sentiment
is
curiosity
and
properly
improved
may
lead
to
gentler
innovations
in
the
very
true
davy
but
ye
keep
us
all
waiting
while
ye
make
your
preparations
and
here
is
pathfinder
drawing
near
to
catch
a
lesson
from
your
greater
well
pathfinder
and
so
have
come
to
get
an
idea
too
concerning
the
philosophy
of
shooting
i
do
not
wish
to
hide
my
light
under
a
bushel
and
yer
welcome
to
all
ye
learn
do
ye
no
mean
to
try
a
shot
yersel
man
why
should
i
quartermaster
why
should
i
i
want
none
of
the
prizes
and
as
for
honor
i
have
had
enough
of
that
if
it
any
honor
to
shoot
better
than
yourself
i
not
a
woman
to
wear
a
very
true
but
ye
might
find
a
woman
that
is
precious
in
your
eyes
to
wear
it
for
ye
as
come
davy
interrupted
the
major
your
shot
or
a
retreat
the
adjutant
is
getting
the
quartermaster
department
and
the
adjutant
department
are
seldom
compliable
lundie
but
i
ready
stand
a
little
aside
pathfinder
and
give
the
ladies
an
lieutenant
muir
now
took
his
attitude
with
a
good
deal
of
studied
elegance
raised
his
rifle
slowly
lowered
it
raised
it
again
repeated
the
manoeuvres
and
fired
missed
the
target
altogether
shouted
the
man
whose
duty
it
was
to
mark
the
bullets
and
who
had
little
relish
for
the
tedious
science
missed
the
target
it
can
not
be
cried
muir
his
face
flushing
equally
with
indignation
and
shame
it
can
not
be
adjutant
for
i
never
did
so
awkward
a
thing
in
my
life
i
appeal
to
the
ladies
for
a
juster
the
ladies
shut
their
eyes
when
you
fired
exclaimed
the
regimental
wags
your
preparations
alarmed
i
will
na
believe
such
calumny
of
the
leddies
nor
sic
a
reproach
on
my
own
skill
returned
the
quartermaster
growing
more
and
more
scotch
as
he
warmed
with
his
feelings
it
a
conspiracy
to
rob
a
meritorious
man
of
his
it
a
dead
miss
muir
said
the
laughing
lundie
and
ye
jist
sit
down
quietly
with
the
no
no
major
pathfinder
at
length
observed
the
quartermaster
a
good
shot
for
a
slow
one
and
a
measured
distance
though
nothing
for
real
service
he
has
covered
jasper
bullet
as
will
be
seen
if
any
one
will
take
the
trouble
to
examine
the
the
respect
for
pathfinder
skill
and
for
his
quickness
and
accuracy
of
sight
was
so
profound
and
general
that
the
instant
he
made
this
declaration
the
spectators
began
to
distrust
their
own
opinions
and
a
dozen
rushed
to
the
target
in
order
to
ascertain
the
fact
there
sure
enough
it
was
found
that
the
quartermaster
bullet
had
gone
through
the
hole
made
by
jasper
and
that
too
so
accurately
as
to
require
a
minute
examination
to
be
certain
of
the
circumstance
which
however
was
soon
clearly
established
by
discovering
one
bullet
over
the
other
in
the
stump
against
which
the
target
was
placed
i
told
ye
ladies
ye
were
about
to
witness
the
influence
of
science
on
gunnery
said
the
quartermaster
advancing
towards
the
staging
occupied
by
the
females
major
duncan
derides
the
idea
of
mathematics
entering
into
but
i
tell
him
philosophy
colors
and
enlarges
and
improves
and
dilates
and
explains
everything
that
belongs
to
human
life
whether
it
be
a
or
a
sermon
in
a
word
philosophy
is
philosophy
and
that
is
saying
all
that
the
subject
i
trust
you
exclude
love
from
the
catalogue
observed
the
wife
of
a
captain
who
knew
the
history
of
the
quartermaster
marriages
and
who
had
a
woman
malice
against
the
monopolizer
of
her
sex
it
seems
that
philosophy
has
little
in
common
with
you
would
say
that
madam
if
your
heart
had
experienced
many
trials
it
the
man
or
the
woman
that
has
had
many
occasions
to
improve
the
affections
that
can
best
speak
of
such
matters
and
believe
me
of
all
love
philosophical
is
the
most
lasting
as
it
is
the
most
you
would
then
recommend
experience
as
an
improvement
on
the
passion
your
quick
mind
has
conceived
the
idea
at
a
glance
the
happiest
marriages
are
those
in
which
youth
and
beauty
and
confidence
on
one
side
rely
on
the
sagacity
moderation
and
prudence
of
years
middle
age
i
mean
madam
for
i
no
deny
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
husband
being
too
old
for
a
wife
here
is
sergeant
dunham
charming
daughter
now
to
approve
of
such
sentiments
i
certain
her
character
for
discretion
being
already
well
established
in
the
garrison
short
as
has
been
her
residence
among
sergeant
dunham
daughter
is
scarcely
a
fitting
interlocutor
in
a
discourse
between
you
and
me
lieutenant
muir
rejoined
the
lady
with
careful
respect
for
her
own
dignity
and
yonder
is
the
pathfinder
about
to
take
his
chance
by
way
of
changing
the
i
protest
major
duncan
i
protest
cried
muir
hurrying
back
towards
the
stand
with
both
arms
elevated
by
way
of
enforcing
his
words
i
protest
in
the
strongest
terms
gentlemen
against
pathfinder
being
admitted
into
these
sports
with
killdeer
which
is
a
piece
to
say
nothing
of
long
habit
that
is
altogether
out
of
proportion
for
a
trial
of
skill
against
government
killdeer
is
taking
its
rest
quartermaster
returned
pathfinder
calmly
and
no
one
here
thinks
of
disturbing
it
i
did
not
think
myself
of
pulling
a
trigger
but
sergeant
dunham
has
been
persuading
me
that
i
shall
not
do
proper
honor
to
his
handsome
daughter
who
came
in
under
my
care
if
i
am
backward
on
such
an
occasion
using
jasper
rifle
quartermaster
as
you
may
see
and
that
is
no
better
than
your
lieutenant
muir
was
now
obliged
to
acquiesce
and
every
eye
turned
towards
the
pathfinder
as
he
took
the
required
station
the
air
and
attitude
of
this
celebrated
guide
and
hunter
were
extremely
fine
as
he
raised
his
tall
form
and
levelled
the
piece
showing
perfect
and
a
through
knowledge
of
the
power
of
the
human
frame
as
well
as
of
the
weapon
pathfinder
was
not
what
is
usually
termed
a
handsome
man
though
his
appearance
excited
so
much
confidence
and
commanded
respect
tall
and
even
muscular
his
frame
might
have
been
esteemed
nearly
perfect
were
it
not
for
the
total
absence
of
everything
like
flesh
whipcord
was
scarcely
more
rigid
than
his
arms
and
legs
or
at
need
more
pliable
but
the
outlines
of
his
person
were
rather
too
angular
for
the
proportion
that
the
eye
most
approves
still
his
motions
being
natural
were
graceful
and
being
calm
and
regulated
they
gave
him
an
air
and
dignity
that
associated
well
with
the
idea
which
was
so
prevalent
of
his
services
and
peculiar
merits
his
honest
open
features
were
burnt
to
a
bright
red
that
comported
well
with
the
notion
of
exposure
and
hardships
while
his
sinewy
hands
denoted
force
and
a
species
of
use
removed
from
the
stiffening
and
deforming
effects
of
labor
although
no
one
perceived
any
of
those
gentler
or
more
insinuating
qualities
which
are
apt
to
win
upon
a
woman
affections
as
he
raised
his
rifle
not
a
female
eye
was
fastened
on
him
without
a
silent
approbation
of
the
freedom
of
his
movements
and
the
manliness
of
his
air
thought
was
scarcely
quicker
than
his
aim
and
as
the
smoke
floated
above
his
head
the
of
the
rifle
was
seen
on
the
ground
the
hand
of
the
pathfinder
was
leaning
on
the
barrel
and
his
honest
countenance
was
illuminated
by
his
usual
silent
hearty
laugh
if
one
dared
to
hint
at
such
a
thing
cried
major
duncan
i
should
say
that
the
pathfinder
had
also
missed
the
no
no
major
returned
the
guide
confidently
that
be
a
risky
declaration
i
did
load
the
piece
and
ca
say
what
was
in
it
but
if
it
was
lead
you
will
find
the
bullet
driving
down
those
of
the
quartermaster
and
jasper
else
is
not
my
name
a
shout
from
the
target
announced
the
truth
of
this
assertion
that
not
all
that
not
all
boys
called
out
the
guide
who
was
now
slowly
advancing
towards
the
stage
occupied
by
the
females
if
you
find
the
target
touched
at
all
i
own
to
a
miss
the
quartermaster
cut
the
wood
but
you
find
no
wood
cut
by
that
last
very
true
pathfinder
very
true
answered
muir
who
was
lingering
near
mabel
though
ashamed
to
address
her
particularly
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
wives
the
quartermaster
did
cut
the
wood
and
by
that
means
he
opened
a
passage
for
your
bullet
which
went
through
the
hole
he
had
well
quartermaster
there
goes
the
nail
and
we
see
who
can
drive
it
closer
you
or
i
for
though
i
did
not
think
of
showing
what
a
rifle
can
do
now
my
hand
is
in
i
turn
my
back
to
no
man
that
carries
king
george
commission
chingachgook
is
outlying
or
he
might
force
me
into
some
of
the
niceties
of
the
art
but
as
for
you
quartermaster
if
the
nail
do
stop
you
the
potato
you
over
boastful
this
morning
pathfinder
but
you
find
no
green
boy
fresh
from
the
settlements
and
the
towns
to
deal
with
i
will
assure
ye
i
know
that
well
quartermaster
i
know
that
well
and
shall
not
deny
your
experience
you
lived
many
years
on
the
frontiers
and
heard
of
you
in
the
colonies
and
among
the
indians
too
quite
a
human
life
na
na
interrupted
muir
in
his
broadest
scotch
this
is
injustice
man
i
no
lived
so
very
long
i
do
you
justice
lieutenant
even
if
you
get
the
best
in
the
potato
trial
i
say
you
passed
a
good
human
life
for
a
soldier
in
places
where
the
rifle
is
daily
used
and
i
know
you
are
a
creditable
and
ingenious
marksman
but
then
you
are
not
a
true
as
for
boasting
i
hope
i
not
a
vain
talker
about
my
own
exploits
but
a
man
gifts
are
his
gifts
and
it
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
to
deny
them
the
sergeant
daughter
here
shall
judge
between
us
if
you
have
the
stomach
to
submit
to
so
pretty
a
the
pathfinder
had
named
mabel
as
the
arbiter
because
he
admired
her
and
because
in
his
eyes
rank
had
little
or
no
value
but
lieutenant
muir
shrank
at
such
a
reference
in
the
presence
of
the
wives
of
the
officers
he
would
gladly
keep
himself
constantly
before
the
eyes
and
the
imagination
of
the
object
of
his
wishes
but
he
was
still
too
much
under
the
influence
of
old
prejudices
and
perhaps
too
wary
to
appear
openly
as
her
suitor
unless
he
saw
something
very
like
a
certainty
of
success
on
the
discretion
of
major
duncan
he
had
a
full
reliance
and
he
apprehended
no
betrayal
from
that
quarter
but
he
was
quite
aware
should
it
ever
get
abroad
that
he
had
been
refused
by
the
child
of
a
officer
he
would
find
great
difficulty
in
making
his
approaches
to
any
other
woman
of
a
condition
to
which
he
might
reasonably
aspire
notwithstanding
these
doubts
and
misgivings
mabel
looked
so
prettily
blushed
so
charmingly
smiled
so
sweetly
and
altogether
presented
so
winning
a
picture
of
youth
spirit
modesty
and
beauty
that
he
found
it
exceedingly
tempting
to
be
kept
so
prominently
before
her
imagination
and
to
be
able
to
address
her
freely
you
shall
have
it
your
own
way
pathfinder
he
answered
as
soon
as
his
doubts
had
settled
down
into
determination
let
the
daughter
his
charming
daughter
i
should
have
termed
her
be
the
umpire
then
and
to
her
we
will
both
dedicate
the
prize
that
one
or
the
other
must
certainly
win
pathfinder
must
be
humored
ladies
as
you
perceive
else
no
doubt
we
should
have
had
the
honor
to
submit
ourselves
to
one
of
your
charming
a
call
for
the
competitors
now
drew
the
quartermaster
and
his
adversary
away
and
in
a
few
moments
the
second
trial
of
skill
commenced
a
common
wrought
nail
was
driven
lightly
into
the
target
its
head
having
been
first
touched
with
paint
and
the
marksman
was
required
to
hit
it
or
he
lost
his
chances
in
the
succeeding
trials
no
one
was
permitted
to
enter
on
this
occasion
who
had
already
failed
in
the
essay
against
the
there
might
have
been
half
a
dozen
aspirants
for
the
honors
of
this
trial
one
or
two
who
had
barely
succeeded
in
touching
the
spot
of
paint
in
the
previous
strife
preferring
to
rest
their
reputations
there
feeling
certain
that
they
could
not
succeed
in
the
greater
effort
that
was
now
exacted
of
them
the
first
three
adventurers
failed
all
coming
very
near
the
mark
but
neither
touching
it
the
fourth
person
who
presented
himself
was
the
quartermaster
who
after
going
through
his
usual
attitudes
so
far
succeeded
as
to
carry
away
a
small
portion
of
the
head
of
the
nail
planting
his
bullet
by
the
side
of
its
point
this
was
not
considered
an
extraordinary
shot
though
it
brought
the
adventurer
within
the
category
you
saved
your
bacon
quartermaster
as
they
say
in
the
settlements
of
their
creaturs
cried
pathfinder
laughing
but
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
build
a
house
with
a
hammer
no
better
than
yours
jasper
here
will
show
you
how
a
nail
is
to
be
started
or
the
lad
has
lost
some
of
his
steadiness
of
hand
and
sartainty
of
eye
you
would
have
done
better
yourself
lieutenant
had
you
not
been
so
much
bent
on
soldierizing
your
figure
shooting
is
a
natural
gift
and
is
to
be
exercised
in
a
natural
we
shall
see
pathfinder
i
call
that
a
pretty
attempt
at
a
nail
and
i
doubt
if
the
has
another
hammer
as
you
call
it
that
can
do
just
the
same
thing
over
jasper
is
not
in
the
but
there
goes
his
as
the
pathfinder
spoke
the
bullet
of
hit
the
nail
square
and
drove
it
into
the
target
within
an
inch
of
the
head
be
all
ready
to
clench
it
boys
cried
out
pathfinder
stepping
into
his
friend
tracks
the
instant
they
were
vacant
never
mind
a
new
nail
i
can
see
that
though
the
paint
is
gone
and
what
i
can
see
i
can
hit
at
a
hundred
yards
though
it
were
only
a
mosquito
eye
be
ready
to
clench
the
rifle
cracked
the
bullet
sped
its
way
and
the
head
of
the
nail
was
buried
in
the
wood
covered
by
the
piece
of
flattened
lead
well
jasper
lad
continued
pathfinder
dropping
the
of
his
rifle
to
the
ground
and
resuming
the
discourse
as
if
he
thought
nothing
of
his
own
exploit
you
improve
daily
a
few
more
tramps
on
land
in
my
company
and
the
best
marksman
on
the
frontiers
will
have
occasion
to
look
keenly
when
he
takes
his
stand
you
the
quartermaster
is
respectable
but
he
will
never
get
any
farther
whereas
you
jasper
have
the
gift
and
may
one
day
defy
any
who
pull
hoot
hoot
exclaimed
muir
do
you
call
hitting
the
head
of
the
nail
respectable
only
when
it
the
perfection
of
the
art
any
one
the
least
refined
and
elevated
in
sentiment
knows
that
the
delicate
touches
denote
the
master
whereas
your
blows
come
from
the
rude
and
uninstructed
if
miss
is
as
good
as
a
mile
a
hit
ought
to
be
better
pathfinder
whether
it
wound
or
the
surest
way
of
settling
this
rivalry
will
be
to
make
another
trial
observed
lundie
and
that
will
be
of
the
potato
you
scotch
muir
and
might
fare
better
were
it
a
cake
or
a
thistle
but
frontier
law
has
declared
for
the
american
fruit
and
the
potato
it
shall
as
major
duncan
manifested
some
impatience
of
manner
muir
had
too
much
tact
to
delay
the
sports
any
longer
with
his
discursive
remarks
but
judiciously
prepared
himself
for
the
next
appeal
to
say
the
truth
the
quartermaster
had
little
or
no
faith
in
his
own
success
in
the
trial
of
skill
that
was
to
follow
nor
would
he
have
been
so
free
in
presenting
himself
as
a
competitor
at
all
had
he
anticipated
it
would
have
been
made
but
major
duncan
who
was
somewhat
of
a
humorist
in
his
own
quiet
scotch
way
had
secretly
ordered
it
to
be
introduced
expressly
to
mortify
him
for
a
laird
himself
lundie
did
not
relish
the
notion
that
one
who
might
claim
to
be
a
gentleman
should
bring
discredit
on
his
caste
by
forming
an
unequal
alliance
as
soon
as
everything
was
prepared
muir
was
summoned
to
the
stand
and
the
potato
was
held
in
readiness
to
be
thrown
as
the
sort
of
feat
we
are
about
to
offer
to
the
reader
however
may
be
new
to
him
a
word
in
explanation
will
render
the
matter
more
clear
a
potato
of
large
size
was
selected
and
given
to
one
who
stood
at
the
distance
of
twenty
yards
from
the
stand
at
the
word
heave
which
was
given
by
the
marksman
the
vegetable
was
thrown
with
a
gentle
toss
into
the
air
and
it
was
the
business
of
the
adventurer
to
cause
a
ball
to
pass
through
it
before
it
reached
the
ground
the
quartermaster
in
a
hundred
experiments
had
once
succeeded
in
accomplishing
this
difficult
feat
but
he
now
essayed
to
perform
it
again
with
a
sort
of
blind
hope
that
was
fated
to
be
disappointed
the
potato
was
thrown
in
the
usual
manner
the
rifle
was
discharged
but
the
flying
target
was
untouched
to
the
and
fall
out
quartermaster
said
lundie
smiling
at
the
success
of
the
artifice
the
honor
of
the
silken
calash
will
lie
between
jasper
and
and
how
is
the
trial
to
end
major
inquired
the
latter
are
we
to
have
the
trial
or
is
it
to
be
settled
by
centre
and
skin
by
centre
and
skin
if
there
is
any
perceptible
difference
otherwise
the
double
shot
must
this
is
an
awful
moment
to
me
pathfinder
observed
jasper
as
he
moved
towards
the
stand
his
face
actually
losing
its
color
in
intensity
of
feeling
pathfinder
gazed
earnestly
at
the
young
man
and
then
begging
major
duncan
to
have
patience
for
a
moment
he
led
his
friend
out
of
the
hearing
of
all
near
him
before
he
spoke
you
seem
to
take
this
matter
to
heart
jasper
the
hunter
remarked
keeping
his
eyes
fastened
on
those
of
the
youth
i
must
own
pathfinder
that
my
feelings
were
never
before
so
much
bound
up
in
and
do
you
so
much
crave
to
outdo
me
an
old
and
tried
friend
and
that
as
it
might
be
in
my
own
way
shooting
is
my
gift
boy
and
no
common
hand
can
equal
i
know
it
i
know
it
pathfinder
but
yet
but
what
jasper
boy
speak
freely
you
talk
to
a
the
young
man
compressed
his
lips
dashed
a
hand
across
his
eye
and
flushed
and
paled
alternately
like
a
girl
confessing
her
love
then
squeezing
the
other
hand
he
said
calmly
like
one
whose
manhood
has
overcome
all
other
sensations
i
would
lose
an
arm
pathfinder
to
be
able
to
make
an
offering
of
that
calash
to
mabel
the
hunter
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
ground
and
as
he
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
stand
he
seemed
to
ponder
deeply
on
what
he
had
just
heard
you
never
could
succeed
in
the
double
trial
jasper
he
suddenly
remarked
of
that
i
am
certain
and
it
troubles
what
a
creature
is
mortal
man
he
pines
for
things
which
are
not
of
his
gift
and
treats
the
bounties
of
providence
lightly
no
matter
no
matter
take
your
station
jasper
for
the
major
is
waiting
and
harken
lad
i
must
touch
the
skin
for
i
could
not
show
my
face
in
the
garrison
with
less
than
i
suppose
i
must
submit
to
my
fate
returned
jasper
flushing
and
losing
his
color
as
before
but
i
will
make
the
effort
if
i
what
a
thing
is
mortal
man
repeated
pathfinder
falling
back
to
allow
his
friend
room
to
take
his
arm
he
overlooks
his
own
gifts
and
craves
those
of
another
the
potato
was
thrown
jasper
fired
and
the
shout
that
followed
preceded
the
announcement
of
the
fact
that
he
had
driven
his
bullet
through
its
centre
or
so
nearly
so
as
to
merit
that
award
here
is
a
competitor
worthy
of
you
pathfinder
cried
major
duncan
with
delight
as
the
former
took
his
station
and
we
may
look
to
some
fine
shooting
in
the
double
what
a
thing
is
mortal
man
repeated
the
hunter
scarcely
seeming
to
notice
what
was
passing
around
him
so
much
were
his
thoughts
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
toss
the
potato
was
tossed
the
rifle
cracked
it
was
remarked
just
as
the
little
black
ball
seemed
stationary
in
the
air
for
the
marksman
evidently
took
unusual
heed
to
his
aim
and
then
a
look
of
disappointment
and
wonder
succeeded
among
those
who
caught
the
falling
target
two
holes
in
one
called
out
the
major
the
skin
the
skin
was
the
answer
only
the
skin
how
this
pathfinder
is
jasper
to
carry
off
the
honors
of
the
day
the
calash
is
his
returned
the
other
shaking
his
head
and
walking
quietly
away
from
the
stand
what
a
creature
is
mortal
man
never
satisfied
with
his
own
gifts
but
for
ever
craving
that
which
providence
denies
as
pathfinder
had
not
buried
his
bullet
in
the
potato
but
had
cut
through
the
skin
the
prize
was
immediately
adjudged
to
jasper
the
calash
was
in
the
hands
of
the
latter
when
the
quartermaster
approached
and
with
a
polite
air
of
cordiality
he
wished
his
successful
rival
joy
of
his
victory
but
now
you
got
the
calash
lad
it
of
no
use
to
you
he
added
it
will
never
make
a
sail
nor
even
an
ensign
i
thinking
you
no
be
sorry
to
see
its
value
in
good
siller
of
the
king
money
can
not
buy
it
lieutenant
returned
jasper
whose
eye
lighted
with
all
the
fire
of
success
and
joy
i
would
rather
have
won
this
calash
than
have
obtained
fifty
new
suits
of
sails
for
the
hoot
hoot
lad
you
are
going
mad
like
all
the
rest
of
them
i
even
venture
to
offer
half
a
guinea
for
the
trifle
rather
than
it
should
lie
kicking
about
in
the
cabin
of
your
cutter
and
in
the
end
become
an
ornament
for
the
head
of
a
although
jasper
did
not
know
that
the
wary
quartermaster
had
not
offered
half
the
actual
cost
of
the
prize
he
heard
the
proposition
with
indifference
shaking
his
head
in
the
negative
he
advanced
towards
the
stage
where
his
approach
excited
a
little
commotion
the
ladies
one
and
all
having
determined
to
accept
the
present
should
the
gallantry
of
the
young
sailor
induce
him
to
offer
it
but
diffidence
no
less
than
admiration
for
another
would
have
prevented
him
from
aspiring
to
the
honor
of
complimenting
any
whom
he
thought
so
much
his
superiors
mabel
said
he
this
prize
is
for
you
unless
unless
what
jasper
answered
the
girl
losing
her
own
bashfulness
in
the
natural
and
generous
wish
to
relieve
his
embarrassment
though
both
reddened
in
a
way
to
betray
strong
feeling
unless
you
may
think
too
indifferently
of
it
because
it
is
offered
by
one
who
may
have
no
right
to
believe
his
gift
will
be
i
do
accept
it
jasper
and
it
shall
be
a
sign
of
the
danger
i
have
passed
in
your
company
and
of
the
gratitude
i
feel
for
your
care
of
me
your
care
and
that
of
the
never
mind
me
never
mind
me
exclaimed
the
latter
this
is
luck
and
jasper
gift
give
him
full
credit
for
both
my
turn
may
come
another
day
mine
and
the
quartermaster
who
seems
to
grudge
the
boy
the
calash
though
what
can
want
of
it
i
can
not
understand
for
he
has
no
and
has
jasper
a
wife
or
have
you
a
wife
yoursel
pathfinder
i
may
want
it
to
help
to
get
a
wife
or
as
a
memorial
that
i
have
had
a
wife
or
as
proof
how
much
i
admire
the
sex
or
because
it
is
a
female
garment
or
for
some
other
equally
respectable
motive
it
not
the
unreflecting
that
are
the
most
prized
by
the
thoughtful
and
there
is
no
surer
sign
that
a
man
made
a
good
husband
to
his
first
consort
let
me
tell
you
all
than
to
see
him
speedily
looking
round
for
a
competent
successor
the
affections
are
good
gifts
from
providence
and
they
that
have
loved
one
faithfully
prove
how
much
of
this
bounty
has
been
lavished
upon
them
by
loving
another
as
soon
as
it
may
be
so
it
may
be
so
i
am
no
practitioner
in
such
things
and
can
not
gainsay
it
but
mabel
here
the
sergeant
daughter
will
give
you
full
credit
for
the
words
come
jasper
although
our
hands
are
out
let
us
see
what
the
other
lads
can
do
with
the
pathfinder
and
his
companions
retired
for
the
sports
were
about
to
proceed
the
ladies
however
were
not
so
much
engrossed
with
as
to
neglect
the
calash
it
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
silk
was
felt
the
fashion
criticized
and
the
work
examined
and
divers
opinions
were
privately
ventured
concerning
the
fitness
of
so
handsome
a
thing
passing
into
the
possession
of
a
officer
child
perhaps
you
will
be
disposed
to
sell
that
calash
mabel
when
it
has
been
a
short
time
in
your
possession
inquired
the
captain
lady
wear
it
i
should
think
you
never
i
may
not
wear
it
madam
returned
our
heroine
modestly
but
i
should
not
like
to
part
with
it
i
daresay
sergeant
dunham
keeps
you
above
the
necessity
of
selling
your
clothes
child
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
money
thrown
away
to
keep
an
article
of
dress
you
can
never
i
should
be
unwilling
to
part
with
the
gift
of
a
but
the
young
man
himself
will
think
all
the
better
of
you
for
your
prudence
after
the
triumph
of
the
day
is
forgotten
it
is
a
pretty
and
a
becoming
calash
and
ought
not
to
be
thrown
i
no
intention
to
throw
it
away
and
if
you
please
would
rather
keep
as
you
will
child
girls
of
your
age
often
overlook
the
real
advantages
remember
however
if
you
do
determine
to
dispose
of
the
thing
that
it
is
bespoke
and
that
i
will
not
take
it
if
you
ever
even
put
it
on
your
own
yes
said
mabel
in
the
meekest
voice
imaginable
though
her
eyes
looked
like
diamonds
and
her
cheeks
reddened
to
the
tints
of
two
roses
as
she
placed
the
forbidden
garment
over
her
shoulders
where
she
kept
it
a
minute
as
if
to
try
its
fitness
and
then
quietly
removed
it
again
the
remainder
of
the
sports
offered
nothing
of
interest
the
shooting
was
reasonably
good
but
the
trials
were
all
of
a
scale
lower
than
those
related
and
the
competitors
were
soon
left
to
themselves
the
ladies
and
most
of
the
officers
withdrew
and
the
remainder
of
the
females
soon
followed
their
example
mabel
was
returning
along
the
low
flat
rocks
that
line
the
shore
of
the
lake
dangling
her
pretty
calash
from
a
prettier
finger
when
pathfinder
met
her
he
carried
the
rifle
which
he
had
used
that
day
but
his
manner
had
less
of
the
frank
ease
of
the
hunter
about
it
than
usual
while
his
eye
seemed
roving
and
uneasy
after
a
few
unmeaning
words
concerning
the
noble
sheet
of
water
before
them
he
turned
towards
his
companion
with
strong
interest
in
his
countenance
and
said
jasper
earned
that
calash
for
you
mabel
without
much
trial
of
his
it
was
fairly
done
no
doubt
no
doubt
the
bullet
passed
neatly
through
the
potato
and
no
man
could
have
done
more
though
others
might
have
done
as
but
no
one
did
as
much
exclaimed
mabel
with
an
animation
that
she
instantly
regretted
for
she
saw
by
the
pained
look
of
the
guide
that
he
was
mortified
equally
by
the
remark
and
by
the
feeling
with
which
it
was
uttered
it
is
true
it
is
true
mabel
no
one
did
as
much
then
but
yet
there
is
no
reason
i
should
deny
my
gifts
which
come
from
providence
yes
yes
no
one
did
as
much
there
but
you
shall
know
what
be
done
here
do
you
observe
the
gulls
that
are
flying
over
our
heads
certainly
pathfinder
there
are
too
many
to
escape
here
where
they
cross
each
other
in
sailing
about
he
added
cocking
and
raising
his
rifle
the
two
the
two
now
look
the
piece
was
presented
quick
as
thought
as
two
of
the
birds
came
in
a
line
though
distant
from
each
other
many
yards
the
report
followed
and
the
bullet
passed
through
the
bodies
of
both
victims
no
sooner
had
the
gulls
fallen
into
the
lake
than
pathfinder
dropped
the
of
the
rifle
and
laughed
in
his
own
peculiar
manner
every
shade
of
dissatisfaction
and
mortified
pride
having
left
his
honest
face
that
is
something
mabel
that
is
something
although
i
have
no
calash
to
give
you
but
ask
jasper
himself
i
leave
it
all
to
jasper
for
a
truer
tongue
and
heart
are
not
in
then
it
was
not
jasper
fault
that
he
gained
the
prize
not
it
he
did
his
best
and
he
did
well
for
one
that
has
water
gifts
rather
than
land
gifts
jasper
is
uncommonly
expert
and
a
better
backer
no
one
need
wish
ashore
or
afloat
but
it
was
my
fault
mabel
that
he
got
the
calash
though
it
makes
no
difference
it
makes
no
difference
for
the
thing
has
gone
to
the
right
i
believe
i
understand
you
pathfinder
said
mabel
blushing
in
spite
of
herself
and
i
look
upon
the
calash
as
the
joint
gift
of
yourself
and
that
would
not
be
doing
justice
to
the
lad
neither
he
won
the
garment
and
had
a
right
to
give
it
away
the
most
you
may
think
mabel
is
to
believe
that
had
i
won
it
it
would
have
gone
to
the
same
i
will
remember
that
pathfinder
and
take
care
that
others
know
your
skill
as
it
has
been
proved
upon
the
poor
gulls
in
my
lord
bless
you
mabel
there
is
no
more
need
of
your
talking
in
favor
of
my
shooting
on
this
frontier
than
of
your
talking
about
the
water
in
the
lake
or
the
sun
in
the
heavens
everybody
knows
what
i
can
do
in
that
way
and
your
words
would
be
thrown
away
as
much
as
french
would
be
thrown
away
on
an
american
then
you
think
that
jasper
knew
you
were
giving
him
this
advantage
of
which
he
had
so
unhandsomely
availed
himself
said
mabel
the
color
which
had
imparted
so
much
lustre
to
her
eyes
gradually
leaving
her
face
which
became
grave
and
thoughtful
i
do
not
say
that
but
very
far
from
it
we
all
forget
things
that
we
have
known
when
eager
after
our
wishes
jasper
is
satisfied
that
i
can
pass
one
bullet
through
two
potatoes
as
i
sent
my
bullet
through
the
gulls
and
he
knows
no
other
man
on
the
frontier
can
do
the
same
thing
but
with
the
calash
before
his
eyes
and
the
hope
of
giving
it
to
you
the
lad
was
inclined
to
think
better
of
himself
just
at
that
moment
perhaps
than
he
ought
no
no
there
nothing
mean
or
distrustful
about
jasper
though
it
is
a
gift
natural
to
all
young
men
to
wish
to
appear
well
in
the
eyes
of
handsome
young
i
try
to
forget
all
but
the
kindness
you
both
shown
to
a
poor
motherless
girl
said
mabel
struggling
to
keep
down
emotions
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
account
for
herself
believe
me
pathfinder
i
can
never
forget
all
you
have
already
done
for
me
you
and
jasper
and
this
new
proof
of
your
regard
is
not
thrown
away
here
here
is
a
brooch
that
is
of
silver
and
i
offer
it
as
a
token
that
i
owe
you
life
or
what
shall
i
do
with
this
mabel
asked
the
bewildered
hunter
holding
the
simple
trinket
in
his
hand
i
have
neither
buckle
nor
button
about
me
for
i
wear
nothing
but
leathern
strings
and
them
of
good
it
pretty
to
the
eye
but
it
is
prettier
far
on
the
spot
it
came
from
than
it
can
be
about
nay
put
it
in
your
it
will
become
it
well
remember
pathfinder
that
it
is
a
token
of
friendship
between
us
and
a
sign
that
i
can
never
forget
you
or
your
mabel
then
smiled
an
adieu
and
bounding
up
the
bank
she
was
soon
lost
to
view
behind
the
mound
of
the
fort
chapter
xii
lo
dusky
masses
steal
in
dubious
sight
along
the
leaguer
wall
and
bristling
bank
of
the
arm
river
while
with
straggling
light
the
stars
peep
through
the
vapor
dim
and
dank
byron
a
few
hours
later
mabel
dunham
was
on
the
bastion
that
overlooked
the
river
and
the
lake
seemingly
in
deep
thought
the
evening
was
calm
and
soft
and
the
question
had
arisen
whether
the
party
for
the
thousand
islands
would
be
able
to
get
out
that
night
or
not
on
account
of
the
total
absence
of
wind
the
stores
arms
and
ammunition
were
already
shipped
and
even
mabel
effects
were
on
board
but
the
small
draft
of
men
that
was
to
go
was
still
ashore
there
being
no
apparent
prospect
of
the
cutter
getting
under
way
jasper
had
warped
the
out
of
the
cove
and
so
far
up
the
stream
as
to
enable
him
to
pass
through
the
outlet
of
the
river
whenever
he
chose
but
there
he
still
lay
riding
at
single
anchor
the
drafted
men
were
lounging
about
the
shore
of
the
cove
undecided
whether
or
not
to
pull
off
the
sports
of
the
morning
had
left
a
quiet
in
the
garrison
which
was
in
harmony
with
the
whole
of
the
beautiful
scene
and
mabel
felt
its
influence
on
her
feelings
though
probably
too
little
accustomed
to
speculate
on
such
sensations
to
be
aware
of
the
cause
everything
near
appeared
lovely
and
soothing
while
the
solemn
grandeur
of
the
silent
forest
and
placid
expanse
of
the
lake
lent
a
sublimity
that
other
scenes
might
have
wanted
for
the
first
time
mabel
felt
the
hold
that
the
towns
and
civilization
had
gained
on
her
habits
sensibly
weakened
and
the
girl
began
to
think
that
a
life
passed
amid
objects
such
as
those
around
her
might
be
happy
how
far
the
experience
of
the
last
days
came
in
aid
of
the
calm
and
holy
eventide
and
contributed
towards
producing
that
young
conviction
may
be
suspected
rather
than
affirmed
in
this
early
portion
of
our
legend
a
charming
sunset
mabel
said
the
hearty
voice
of
her
uncle
so
close
to
the
ear
of
our
heroine
as
to
cause
her
to
start
a
charming
sunset
girl
for
a
concern
though
we
should
think
but
little
of
it
at
and
is
not
nature
the
same
on
shore
or
at
sea
on
a
lake
like
this
or
on
the
ocean
does
not
the
sun
shine
on
all
alike
dear
uncle
and
can
we
not
feel
gratitude
for
the
blessings
of
providence
as
strongly
on
this
remote
frontier
as
in
our
own
manhattan
the
girl
has
fallen
in
with
some
of
her
mother
books
is
not
nature
the
same
indeed
now
mabel
do
you
imagine
that
the
nature
of
a
soldier
is
the
same
as
that
of
a
seafaring
man
you
relations
in
both
callings
and
ought
to
be
able
to
but
uncle
i
mean
human
so
do
i
girl
the
human
nature
of
a
seaman
and
the
human
nature
of
one
of
these
fellows
of
the
not
even
excepting
your
own
father
here
have
they
had
a
i
should
call
it
this
day
and
what
a
different
thing
has
it
been
from
a
afloat
there
we
should
have
sprung
our
broadside
sported
with
round
shot
at
an
object
half
a
mile
off
at
the
very
nearest
and
the
potatoes
if
there
happened
to
be
any
on
board
as
very
likely
would
not
have
been
the
case
would
have
been
left
in
the
cook
coppers
it
may
be
an
honorable
calling
that
of
a
soldier
mabel
but
an
experienced
hand
sees
many
follies
and
weaknesses
in
one
of
these
forts
as
for
that
bit
of
a
lake
you
know
my
opinion
of
it
already
and
i
wish
to
disparage
nothing
no
real
seafarer
disparages
anything
but
d
if
i
regard
this
here
ontario
as
they
call
it
as
more
than
so
much
water
in
a
ship
now
look
you
here
mabel
if
you
wish
to
understand
the
difference
between
the
ocean
and
a
lake
i
can
make
you
comprehend
it
with
a
single
look
this
is
what
one
may
call
a
calm
seeing
that
there
is
no
wind
though
to
own
the
truth
i
do
not
think
the
calms
are
as
calm
as
them
we
get
outside
uncle
there
is
not
a
breath
of
air
i
do
not
think
it
possible
for
the
leaves
to
be
more
immovably
still
than
those
of
the
entire
forest
are
at
this
very
leaves
what
are
leaves
child
there
are
no
leaves
at
sea
if
you
wish
to
know
whether
it
is
a
dead
calm
or
not
try
a
mould
candle
your
dips
flaring
too
much
and
then
you
may
be
certain
whether
there
is
or
is
not
any
wind
if
you
were
in
a
latitude
where
the
air
was
so
still
that
you
found
a
difficulty
in
stirring
it
to
draw
it
in
in
breathing
you
might
fancy
it
a
calm
people
are
often
on
a
short
allowance
of
air
in
the
calm
latitudes
here
again
look
at
that
water
it
is
like
milk
in
a
pan
with
no
more
motion
now
than
there
is
in
a
full
hogshead
before
the
bung
is
started
on
the
ocean
the
water
is
never
still
let
the
air
be
as
quiet
as
it
the
water
of
the
ocean
never
still
uncle
cap
not
even
in
a
calm
bless
your
heart
no
child
the
ocean
breathes
like
a
living
being
and
its
bosom
is
always
heaving
as
the
poetizers
call
it
though
there
be
no
more
air
than
is
to
be
found
in
a
siphon
no
man
ever
saw
the
ocean
still
like
this
lake
but
it
heaves
and
sets
as
if
it
had
and
this
lake
is
not
absolutely
still
for
you
perceive
there
is
a
little
ripple
on
the
shore
and
you
may
even
hear
the
surf
plunging
at
moments
against
the
all
d
d
poetry
lake
ontario
is
no
more
the
atlantic
than
a
powles
hook
periagila
is
a
that
jasper
notwithstanding
is
a
fine
lad
and
wants
instruction
only
to
make
a
man
of
do
you
think
him
ignorant
uncle
answered
mabel
prettily
adjusting
her
hair
in
order
to
do
which
she
was
obliged
or
fancied
she
was
obliged
to
turn
away
her
face
to
me
jasper
appears
to
know
more
than
most
of
the
young
men
of
his
class
he
has
read
but
little
for
books
are
not
plenty
in
this
part
of
the
world
but
he
has
thought
much
as
least
so
it
seems
to
me
for
one
so
he
is
ignorant
as
all
must
be
who
navigate
an
inland
water
like
this
no
no
mabel
we
both
owe
something
to
jasper
and
the
pathfinder
and
i
have
been
thinking
how
i
can
best
serve
them
for
i
hold
ingratitude
to
be
the
vice
of
a
hog
for
treat
the
animal
to
your
own
dinner
and
he
would
eat
you
for
the
very
true
dear
uncle
we
ought
indeed
to
do
all
we
can
to
express
our
proper
sense
of
the
services
of
both
these
brave
spoken
like
your
mother
daughter
girl
and
in
a
way
to
do
credit
to
the
cap
family
now
i
hit
upon
a
traverse
that
will
just
suit
all
parties
and
as
soon
as
we
get
back
from
this
little
expedition
down
the
lake
among
them
there
thousand
islands
and
i
am
ready
to
return
it
is
my
intention
to
propose
dearest
uncle
this
is
so
considerate
in
you
and
will
be
so
just
may
i
ask
what
your
intentions
are
i
see
no
reason
for
keeping
them
a
secret
from
you
mabel
though
nothing
need
be
said
to
your
father
about
them
for
the
sergeant
has
his
prejudices
and
might
throw
difficulties
in
the
way
neither
jasper
nor
his
friend
pathfinder
can
ever
make
anything
hereabouts
and
i
propose
to
take
both
with
me
down
to
the
coast
and
get
them
fairly
afloat
jasper
would
find
his
in
a
fortnight
and
a
would
make
him
a
man
although
pathfinder
might
take
more
time
or
never
get
to
be
rated
able
yet
one
could
make
something
of
him
too
particularly
as
a
for
he
has
unusually
good
uncle
do
you
think
either
would
consent
to
this
said
mabel
smiling
do
i
suppose
them
simpletons
what
rational
being
would
neglect
his
own
advancement
let
jasper
alone
to
push
his
way
and
the
lad
may
yet
die
the
master
of
some
and
would
he
be
any
the
happier
for
it
dear
uncle
how
much
better
is
it
to
be
the
master
of
a
craft
than
to
be
master
of
a
craft
pooh
pooh
magnet
you
are
just
fit
to
read
lectures
about
ships
before
some
hysterical
society
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
leave
these
things
to
me
and
they
be
properly
managed
ah
here
is
the
pathfinder
himself
and
i
may
just
as
well
drop
him
a
hint
of
my
benevolent
intentions
as
regards
himself
hope
is
a
great
encourager
of
our
cap
nodded
his
head
and
then
ceased
to
speak
while
the
hunter
approached
not
with
his
usual
frank
and
easy
manner
but
in
a
way
to
show
that
he
was
slightly
embarrassed
if
not
distrustful
of
his
reception
uncle
and
niece
make
a
family
party
said
pathfinder
when
near
the
two
and
a
stranger
may
not
prove
a
welcome
companion
you
are
no
stranger
master
pathfinder
returned
cap
and
no
one
can
be
more
welcome
than
yourself
we
were
talking
of
you
but
a
moment
ago
and
when
friends
speak
of
an
absent
man
he
can
guess
what
they
have
i
ask
no
secrets
every
man
has
his
enemies
and
i
have
mine
though
i
count
neither
you
master
cap
nor
pretty
mabel
here
among
the
number
as
for
the
mingos
i
will
say
nothing
though
they
have
no
just
cause
to
hate
that
i
answer
for
pathfinder
for
you
strike
my
fancy
as
being
and
upright
there
is
a
method
however
of
getting
away
from
the
enmity
of
even
these
mingos
and
if
you
choose
to
take
it
no
one
will
more
willingly
point
it
out
than
myself
without
a
charge
for
my
advice
i
wish
no
enemies
saltwater
for
so
the
pathfinder
had
begun
to
call
cap
having
insensibly
to
himself
adopted
the
term
by
translating
the
name
given
him
by
the
indians
in
and
about
the
fort
i
wish
no
enemies
i
as
ready
to
bury
the
hatchet
with
the
mingos
as
with
the
french
though
you
know
that
it
depends
on
one
greater
than
either
of
us
so
to
turn
the
heart
as
to
leave
a
man
without
by
lifting
your
anchor
and
accompanying
me
down
to
the
coast
friend
pathfinder
when
we
get
back
from
this
short
cruise
on
which
we
are
bound
you
will
find
yourself
beyond
the
sound
of
the
and
safe
enough
from
any
indian
and
what
should
i
do
on
the
salt
water
hunt
in
your
towns
follow
the
trails
of
people
going
and
coming
from
market
and
ambush
dogs
and
poultry
you
are
no
friend
to
my
happiness
master
cap
if
you
would
lead
me
out
of
the
shades
of
the
woods
to
put
me
in
the
sun
of
the
i
did
not
propose
to
leave
you
in
the
settlements
pathfinder
but
to
carry
you
out
to
sea
where
a
man
can
only
be
said
to
breathe
freely
mabel
will
tell
you
that
such
was
my
intention
before
a
word
was
said
on
the
and
what
does
mabel
think
would
come
of
such
a
change
she
knows
that
a
man
has
his
gifts
and
that
it
is
as
useless
to
pretend
to
others
as
to
withstand
them
that
come
from
providence
i
am
a
hunter
and
a
scout
or
a
guide
saltwater
and
it
is
not
in
me
to
fly
so
much
in
the
face
of
heaven
as
to
try
to
become
anything
else
am
i
right
mabel
or
are
you
so
much
a
woman
as
to
wish
to
see
a
natur
altered
i
would
wish
to
see
no
change
in
you
pathfinder
mabel
answered
with
a
cordial
sincerity
and
frankness
that
went
directly
to
the
heart
and
much
as
my
uncle
admires
the
sea
and
great
as
is
all
the
good
that
he
thinks
may
come
of
it
i
could
not
wish
to
see
the
best
and
noblest
hunter
of
the
woods
transformed
into
an
admiral
remain
what
you
are
my
brave
friend
and
you
need
fear
nothing
short
of
the
anger
of
do
you
hear
this
saltwater
do
you
hear
what
the
sergeant
daughter
is
saying
and
she
is
much
too
upright
and
and
pretty
not
to
think
what
she
says
so
long
as
she
is
satisfied
with
me
as
i
am
i
shall
not
fly
in
the
face
of
the
gifts
of
providence
by
striving
to
become
anything
else
i
may
seem
useless
here
in
a
garrison
but
when
we
get
down
among
the
thousand
islands
there
may
be
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
a
sure
rifle
is
sometimes
a
you
are
then
to
be
of
our
party
said
mabel
smiling
so
frankly
and
so
sweetly
on
the
guide
that
he
would
have
followed
her
to
the
end
of
the
earth
i
shall
be
the
only
female
with
the
exception
of
one
wife
and
shall
feel
none
the
less
secure
pathfinder
because
you
will
be
among
our
the
sergeant
would
do
that
mabel
though
you
were
not
of
his
kin
no
one
will
overlook
you
i
should
think
your
uncle
here
would
like
an
expedition
of
this
sort
where
we
shall
go
with
sails
and
have
a
look
at
an
inland
sea
your
inland
sea
is
no
great
matter
master
pathfinder
and
i
expect
nothing
from
it
i
confess
however
i
should
like
to
know
the
object
of
the
cruise
for
one
does
not
wish
to
be
idle
and
my
the
sergeant
is
as
as
a
freemason
do
you
know
mabel
what
all
this
means
not
in
the
least
uncle
i
dare
not
ask
my
father
any
questions
about
his
duty
for
he
thinks
it
is
not
a
woman
business
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
we
are
to
sail
as
soon
as
the
wind
will
permit
and
that
we
are
to
be
absent
a
perhaps
master
pathfinder
can
give
me
a
useful
hint
for
a
without
an
object
is
never
pleasant
to
an
old
there
is
no
great
secret
saltwater
concerning
our
port
and
object
though
it
is
forbidden
to
talk
much
about
either
in
the
garrison
i
am
no
soldier
however
and
can
use
my
tongue
as
i
please
though
as
little
given
as
another
to
idle
conversation
i
hope
still
as
we
sail
so
soon
and
you
are
both
to
be
of
the
party
you
may
as
well
be
told
where
you
are
to
be
carried
you
know
that
there
are
such
things
as
the
thousand
islands
i
suppose
master
cap
ay
what
are
so
called
hereaway
though
i
take
it
for
granted
that
they
are
not
real
islands
such
as
we
fall
in
with
on
the
ocean
and
that
the
thousand
means
some
such
matter
as
two
or
my
eyes
are
good
and
yet
have
i
often
been
foiled
in
trying
to
count
them
very
ay
ay
i
known
people
who
could
count
beyond
a
certain
number
your
real
never
know
their
own
roosts
even
in
a
landfall
at
sea
how
many
times
have
i
seen
the
beach
and
houses
and
churches
when
the
passengers
have
not
been
able
to
see
anything
but
water
i
have
no
idea
that
a
man
can
get
fairly
out
of
sight
of
land
on
fresh
water
the
thing
appears
to
me
to
be
irrational
and
you
do
know
the
lakes
master
cap
or
you
would
not
say
that
before
we
get
to
the
thousand
islands
you
will
have
other
notions
of
what
natur
has
done
in
this
i
have
my
doubts
whether
you
have
such
a
thing
as
a
real
island
in
all
this
we
show
you
hundreds
of
them
not
exactly
a
thousand
perhaps
but
so
many
that
eye
can
not
see
them
all
nor
tongue
count
i
engage
when
the
truth
comes
to
be
known
they
turn
out
to
be
nothing
but
peninsulas
or
promontories
or
continents
though
these
are
matters
i
daresay
of
which
you
know
little
or
nothing
but
islands
or
no
islands
what
is
the
object
of
the
cruise
master
pathfinder
there
can
be
no
harm
in
giving
you
some
idea
of
what
we
are
going
to
do
being
so
old
a
sailor
master
cap
you
heard
no
doubt
of
such
a
port
as
frontenac
who
has
i
will
not
say
i
ever
been
inside
the
harbor
but
frequently
been
off
the
then
you
are
about
to
go
upon
ground
with
which
you
are
acquainted
these
great
lakes
you
must
know
make
a
chain
the
water
passing
out
of
one
into
the
other
until
it
reaches
erie
which
is
a
sheet
off
here
to
the
westward
as
large
as
ontario
itself
well
out
of
erie
the
water
comes
until
it
reaches
a
low
mountain
like
over
the
edge
of
which
it
i
should
like
to
know
how
the
devil
it
can
do
that
why
easy
enough
master
cap
returned
pathfinder
laughing
seeing
that
it
has
only
to
fall
down
hill
had
i
said
the
water
went
the
mountain
there
would
have
been
natur
it
but
we
hold
it
no
great
matter
for
water
to
run
down
hill
that
is
ay
ay
but
you
speak
of
the
water
of
a
lake
coming
down
the
side
of
a
mountain
it
in
the
teeth
of
reason
if
reason
has
any
well
well
we
will
not
dispute
the
point
but
what
i
seen
seen
after
getting
into
ontario
all
the
water
of
the
lakes
passes
down
into
the
sea
by
a
river
and
in
the
narrow
part
of
the
sheet
where
it
is
neither
river
nor
lake
lie
the
islands
spoken
of
now
frontenac
is
a
post
of
the
frenchers
above
these
same
islands
and
as
they
hold
the
garrison
below
their
stores
and
ammunition
are
sent
up
the
river
to
frontenac
to
be
forwarded
along
the
shores
of
this
and
the
other
lakes
in
order
to
enable
the
enemy
to
play
his
devilries
among
the
savages
and
to
take
christian
and
will
our
presence
prevent
these
horrible
acts
demanded
mabel
with
interest
it
may
or
it
may
not
as
providence
wills
lundie
as
they
call
him
he
who
commands
this
garrison
sent
a
party
down
to
take
a
station
among
the
islands
to
cut
off
some
of
the
french
boats
and
this
expedition
of
ours
will
be
the
second
relief
as
yet
they
not
done
much
though
two
bateaux
loaded
with
indian
goods
have
been
taken
but
a
runner
came
in
last
week
and
brought
such
tidings
that
the
major
is
about
to
make
a
last
effort
to
circumvent
the
knaves
jasper
knows
the
way
and
we
shall
be
in
good
hands
for
the
sergeant
is
prudent
and
of
the
first
quality
at
an
ambushment
yes
he
is
both
prudent
and
is
this
all
said
cap
contemptuously
by
the
preparations
and
equipments
i
had
thought
there
was
a
forced
trade
in
the
wind
and
that
an
honest
penny
might
be
turned
by
taking
an
adventure
i
suppose
there
are
no
shares
in
your
anan
i
take
it
for
granted
the
king
gets
all
in
these
soldiering
parties
and
ambushments
as
you
call
i
know
nothing
about
that
master
cap
i
take
my
share
of
the
lead
and
powder
if
any
falls
into
our
hands
and
say
nothing
to
the
king
about
it
if
any
one
fares
better
it
is
not
i
though
it
is
time
i
did
begin
to
think
of
a
house
and
furniture
and
a
although
the
pathfinder
did
not
dare
to
look
at
mabel
while
he
made
this
direct
allusion
to
his
change
of
life
he
would
have
given
the
world
to
know
whether
she
was
listening
and
what
was
the
expression
of
her
countenance
mabel
little
suspected
the
nature
of
the
allusion
however
and
her
countenance
was
perfectly
unembarrassed
as
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
river
where
the
appearance
of
some
movement
on
board
the
began
to
be
visible
jasper
is
bringing
the
cutter
out
observed
the
guide
whose
look
was
drawn
in
the
same
direction
by
the
fall
of
some
heavy
article
on
the
deck
the
lad
sees
the
signs
of
wind
no
doubt
and
wishes
to
be
ready
for
ay
now
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
learning
seamanship
returned
cap
with
a
sneer
there
is
a
nicety
in
getting
a
craft
under
her
canvas
that
shows
the
thoroughbred
mariner
as
much
as
anything
else
it
like
a
soldier
buttoning
his
coat
and
one
can
see
whether
he
begins
at
the
top
or
the
i
will
not
say
that
jasper
is
equal
to
your
seafarers
below
observed
pathfinder
across
whose
upright
mind
an
unworthy
feeling
of
envy
or
of
jealousy
never
passed
but
he
is
a
bold
boy
and
manages
his
cutter
as
skillfully
as
any
man
can
desire
on
this
lake
at
least
you
find
him
backwards
at
the
oswego
falls
master
cap
where
fresh
water
contrives
to
tumble
down
hill
with
little
cap
made
no
other
answer
than
a
dissatisfied
ejaculation
and
then
a
general
silence
followed
all
on
the
bastion
studying
the
movements
of
the
cutter
with
the
interest
that
was
natural
to
their
own
future
connection
with
the
vessel
it
was
still
a
dead
calm
the
surface
of
the
lake
literally
glittering
with
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
the
had
been
warped
up
to
a
kedge
that
lay
a
hundred
yards
above
the
points
of
the
outlet
where
she
had
room
to
manoeuvre
in
the
river
which
then
formed
the
harbor
of
oswego
but
the
total
want
of
air
prevented
any
such
attempt
and
it
was
soon
evident
that
the
light
vessel
was
to
be
taken
through
the
passage
under
her
sweeps
not
a
sail
was
loosened
but
as
soon
as
the
kedge
was
tripped
the
heavy
fall
of
the
sweeps
was
heard
when
the
cutter
with
her
head
up
stream
began
to
sheer
towards
the
centre
of
the
current
on
reaching
which
the
efforts
of
the
men
ceased
and
she
drifted
towards
the
outlet
in
the
narrow
pass
itself
her
movement
was
rapid
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
was
floating
outside
of
the
two
low
gravelly
points
which
intercepted
the
waves
of
the
lake
no
anchor
was
let
go
but
the
vessel
continued
to
set
off
from
the
land
until
her
dark
hull
was
seen
resting
on
the
glossy
surface
of
the
lake
full
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
the
low
bluff
which
formed
the
eastern
extremity
of
what
might
be
called
the
outer
harbor
or
roadstead
here
the
influence
of
the
river
current
ceased
and
she
became
virtually
stationary
she
seems
very
beautiful
to
me
uncle
said
mabel
whose
gaze
had
not
been
averted
from
the
cutter
for
a
single
moment
while
it
had
thus
been
changing
its
position
i
daresay
you
can
find
faults
in
her
appearance
and
in
the
way
she
is
managed
but
to
my
ignorance
both
are
ay
ay
she
drops
down
with
a
current
well
enough
girl
and
so
would
a
chip
but
when
you
come
to
niceties
all
old
tar
like
myself
has
no
need
of
spectacles
to
find
well
master
cap
put
in
the
guide
who
seldom
heard
anything
to
jasper
prejudice
without
manifesting
a
disposition
to
interfere
heard
old
and
experienced
saltwater
mariners
confess
that
the
is
as
pretty
a
craft
as
floats
i
know
nothing
of
such
matters
myself
but
one
may
have
his
own
notions
about
a
ship
even
though
they
be
wrong
notions
and
it
would
take
more
than
one
witness
to
persuade
me
jasper
does
not
keep
his
boat
in
good
i
do
not
say
that
the
cutter
is
downright
lubberly
master
pathfinder
but
she
has
faults
and
great
and
what
are
they
uncle
if
he
knew
them
jasper
would
be
glad
to
mend
what
are
they
why
fifty
ay
for
that
matter
a
hundred
very
material
and
manifest
do
name
them
sir
and
pathfinder
will
mention
them
to
his
name
them
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
call
off
the
stars
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
are
so
numerous
name
them
indeed
why
my
pretty
niece
miss
magnet
what
do
you
think
of
that
now
to
my
ignorant
eyes
it
is
topped
at
least
a
foot
too
high
and
then
the
pennant
is
foul
and
and
ay
d
if
there
is
a
topsail
gasket
adrift
and
it
would
surprise
me
at
all
if
there
should
be
a
round
turn
in
that
hawser
if
the
kedge
were
to
be
let
go
this
instant
faults
indeed
no
seaman
could
look
at
her
a
moment
without
seeing
that
she
is
as
full
of
faults
as
a
servant
who
has
asked
for
his
this
may
be
very
true
uncle
though
i
much
question
if
jasper
knows
of
them
i
do
not
think
he
would
suffer
these
things
pathfinder
if
they
were
once
pointed
out
to
let
jasper
manage
his
own
cutter
mabel
his
gift
lies
and
i
answer
for
it
no
one
can
teach
him
how
to
keep
the
out
of
the
hands
of
the
frontenackers
or
their
devilish
mingo
friends
who
cares
for
round
turns
in
kedges
and
for
hawsers
that
are
topped
too
high
master
cap
so
long
as
the
craft
sails
well
and
keeps
clear
of
the
frenchers
i
will
trust
jasper
against
all
the
seafarers
of
the
coast
up
here
on
the
lakes
but
i
do
not
say
he
has
any
gift
for
the
ocean
for
there
he
has
never
been
cap
smiled
condescendingly
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
push
his
criticisms
any
further
just
as
that
moment
by
this
time
the
cutter
had
begun
to
drift
at
the
mercy
of
the
currents
of
the
lake
her
head
turning
in
all
directions
though
slowly
and
not
in
a
way
to
attract
particular
attention
just
at
this
moment
the
jib
was
loosened
and
hoisted
and
presently
the
canvas
swelled
towards
the
land
though
no
evidences
of
air
were
yet
to
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
water
slight
however
as
was
the
impulsion
the
light
hull
yielded
and
in
another
minute
the
was
seen
standing
across
the
current
of
the
river
with
a
movement
so
easy
and
moderate
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
when
out
of
the
stream
she
struck
an
eddy
and
shot
up
towards
the
land
under
the
eminence
where
the
fort
stood
when
jasper
dropped
his
kedge
not
lubberly
done
muttered
cap
in
a
sort
of
soliloquy
not
over
lubberly
though
he
should
have
put
his
helm
instead
of
for
a
vessel
ought
always
to
with
her
head
off
shore
whether
she
is
a
league
from
the
land
or
only
a
cable
length
since
it
has
a
careful
look
and
looks
are
something
in
this
jasper
is
a
handy
lad
suddenly
observed
sergeant
dunham
at
his
elbow
and
we
place
great
reliance
on
his
skill
in
our
expeditions
but
come
one
and
all
we
have
but
half
an
hour
more
of
daylight
to
embark
in
and
the
boats
will
be
ready
for
us
by
the
time
we
are
ready
for
on
this
intimation
the
whole
party
separated
each
to
find
those
trifles
which
had
not
been
shipped
already
a
few
taps
of
the
drum
gave
the
necessary
signal
to
the
soldiers
and
in
a
minute
all
were
in
motion

the

small
a

was
a
matter

no

the
whole

confided
to
the

consisted
of
but
ten

and
two
officers
though
it
was
soon
positively

was
to
accompany

expedition
the
quartermaster
however
went
as
a
volunteer
while
some
duty
connected
with
his
own
department
as
had
been
arranged
between
him
and
his
commander
was
the
avowed
object
to
these
must
be
added
the
pathfinder
and
cap
with
jasper
and
his
subordinates
one
of
whom
was
a
boy
the
party
consequently
consisted
of
less
than
twenty
men
and
a
lad
of
fourteen
mabel
and
the
wife
of
a
common
soldier
were
the
only
females
sergeant
dunham
carried
off
his
command
in
a
large
bateau
and
then
returned
for
his
final
orders
and
to
see
that
his
and
daughter
were
properly
attended
to
having
pointed
out
to
cap
the
boat
that
he
and
mabel
were
to
use
he
ascended
the
hill
to
seek
his
last
interview
with
lundie
it
was
nearly
dark
when
mabel
found
herself
in
the
boat
that
was
to
carry
her
off
to
the
cutter
so
very
smooth
was
the
surface
of
the
lake
that
it
was
not
found
necessary
to
bring
the
bateaux
into
the
river
to
receive
their
freights
but
the
beach
outside
being
totally
without
surf
and
the
water
as
tranquil
as
that
of
a
pond
everybody
embarked
there
when
the
boat
left
the
land
mabel
would
not
have
known
that
she
was
afloat
on
so
broad
a
sheet
of
water
by
any
movement
which
is
usual
to
such
circumstances
the
oars
had
barely
time
to
give
a
dozen
strokes
when
the
boat
lay
at
the
cutter
side
jasper
was
in
readiness
to
receive
his
passengers
and
as
the
deck
of
the
was
but
two
or
three
feet
above
the
water
no
difficulty
was
experienced
in
getting
on
board
of
her
as
soon
as
this
was
effected
the
young
man
pointed
out
to
mabel
and
her
companion
the
accommodations
prepared
for
their
reception
the
little
vessel
contained
four
apartments
below
all
between
decks
having
been
expressly
constructed
with
a
view
to
the
transportation
of
officers
and
men
with
their
wives
and
families
first
in
rank
was
what
was
called
the
a
small
apartment
that
contained
four
berths
and
which
enjoyed
the
advantage
of
possessing
small
windows
for
the
admission
of
air
and
light
this
was
uniformly
devoted
to
females
whenever
any
were
on
board
and
as
mabel
and
her
companion
were
alone
they
had
ample
accommodation
the
main
cabin
was
larger
and
lighted
from
above
it
was
now
appropriated
to
the
quartermaster
the
sergeant
cap
and
jasper
the
pathfinder
roaming
through
any
part
of
the
cutter
he
pleased
the
female
apartment
excepted
the
corporals
and
common
soldiers
occupied
the
space
beneath
the
main
hatch
which
had
a
deck
for
such
a
purpose
while
the
crew
were
berthed
as
usual
in
the
forecastle
although
the
cutter
did
not
measure
quite
fifty
tons
the
draft
of
officers
and
men
was
so
light
that
there
was
ample
room
for
all
on
board
there
being
space
enough
to
accommodate
treble
the
number
if
necessary
as
soon
as
mabel
had
taken
possession
of
her
own
really
comfortable
cabin
in
doing
which
she
could
not
abstain
from
indulging
in
the
pleasant
reflection
that
some
of
jasper
favor
had
been
especially
manifested
in
her
behalf
she
went
on
deck
again
here
all
was
momentarily
in
motion
the
men
were
roving
to
and
fro
in
quest
of
their
knapsacks
and
other
effects
but
method
and
habit
soon
reduced
things
to
order
when
the
stillness
on
board
became
even
imposing
for
it
was
connected
with
the
idea
of
future
adventure
and
ominous
preparation
darkness
was
now
beginning
to
render
objects
on
shore
indistinct
the
whole
of
the
land
forming
one
shapeless
black
outline
of
even
forest
summits
to
be
distinguished
from
the
impending
heavens
only
by
the
greater
light
of
the
sky
the
stars
however
soon
began
to
appear
in
the
latter
one
after
another
in
their
usual
mild
placid
lustre
bringing
with
them
that
sense
of
quiet
which
ordinarily
accompanies
night
there
was
something
soothing
as
well
as
exciting
in
such
a
scene
and
mabel
who
was
seated
on
the
sensibly
felt
both
influences
the
pathfinder
was
standing
near
her
leaning
as
usual
on
his
long
rifle
and
she
fancied
that
through
the
growing
darkness
of
the
hour
she
could
trace
even
stronger
lines
of
thought
than
usual
in
his
rugged
countenance
to
you
pathfinder
expeditions
like
this
can
be
no
great
novelty
said
she
though
i
am
surprised
to
find
how
silent
and
thoughtful
the
men
appear
to
we
learn
this
by
making
war
indians
your
militia
are
great
talkers
and
little
doers
in
general
but
the
soldier
who
has
often
met
the
mingos
learns
to
know
the
value
of
a
prudent
tongue
a
silent
army
in
the
woods
is
doubly
strong
and
a
noisy
one
doubly
weak
if
tongues
made
soldiers
the
women
of
a
camp
would
generally
carry
the
but
we
are
neither
an
army
nor
in
the
woods
there
can
be
no
danger
of
mingos
in
the
no
one
is
safe
from
a
mingo
who
does
not
understand
his
very
natur
and
even
then
he
must
act
up
to
his
own
knowledge
and
that
closely
ask
jasper
how
he
got
command
of
this
very
and
how
he
get
command
inquired
mabel
with
an
earnestness
and
interest
that
quite
delighted
her
and
companion
who
was
never
better
pleased
than
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
aught
in
favor
of
a
friend
it
is
honorable
to
him
that
he
has
reached
this
station
while
yet
so
that
is
it
but
he
deserved
it
all
and
more
a
frigate
would
have
been
too
much
to
pay
for
so
much
spirit
and
coolness
had
there
been
such
a
thing
on
ontario
as
there
is
not
or
likely
to
but
jasper
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
he
got
the
command
of
the
it
is
a
long
story
mabel
and
one
your
father
the
sergeant
can
tell
much
better
than
i
for
he
was
present
while
i
was
off
on
a
distant
scouting
jasper
is
not
good
at
a
story
i
will
own
that
i
have
heard
him
questioned
about
this
affair
and
he
never
made
a
good
tale
of
it
although
every
body
knows
it
was
a
good
thing
the
had
near
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
french
and
the
mingos
when
jasper
saved
her
in
a
way
which
none
but
a
mind
and
a
bold
heart
would
have
attempted
the
sergeant
will
tell
the
tale
better
than
i
can
and
i
wish
you
to
question
him
some
day
when
nothing
better
mabel
determined
to
ask
her
father
to
repeat
the
incidents
of
the
affair
that
very
night
for
it
struck
her
young
fancy
that
nothing
better
could
well
offer
than
to
listen
to
the
praises
of
one
who
was
a
bad
historian
of
his
own
exploits
will
the
remain
with
us
when
we
reach
the
island
she
asked
after
a
little
hesitation
about
the
propriety
of
the
question
or
shall
we
be
left
to
ourselves
that
as
may
be
jasper
does
not
often
keep
the
cutter
idle
when
anything
is
to
be
done
and
we
may
expect
activity
on
his
part
my
gifts
however
run
so
little
towards
the
water
and
vessels
generally
unless
it
be
among
rapids
and
falls
and
in
canoes
that
i
pretend
to
know
nothing
about
it
we
shall
have
all
right
under
jasper
i
make
no
doubt
who
can
find
a
trail
on
ontario
as
well
as
a
delaware
can
find
one
on
the
and
our
own
delaware
pathfinder
the
big
serpent
why
is
he
not
with
us
your
question
would
have
been
more
natural
had
you
said
why
are
here
pathfinder
the
sarpent
is
in
his
place
while
i
am
not
in
mine
he
is
out
with
two
or
three
more
scouting
the
lake
shores
and
will
join
us
down
among
the
islands
with
the
tidings
he
may
gather
the
sergeant
is
too
good
a
soldier
to
forget
his
rear
while
he
is
facing
the
enemy
in
front
it
a
thousand
pities
mabel
your
father
was
born
a
general
as
some
of
the
english
are
who
come
among
us
for
i
feel
sartain
he
would
leave
a
frencher
in
the
canadas
a
week
could
he
have
his
own
way
with
shall
we
have
enemies
to
face
in
front
asked
mabel
smiling
and
for
the
first
time
feeling
a
slight
apprehension
about
the
dangers
of
the
expedition
are
we
likely
to
have
an
engagement
if
we
have
mabel
there
will
be
men
enough
ready
and
willing
to
stand
between
you
and
harm
but
you
are
a
soldier
daughter
and
we
all
know
have
the
spirit
of
one
do
let
the
fear
of
a
battle
keep
your
pretty
eyes
from
i
do
feel
braver
out
here
in
the
woods
pathfinder
than
i
ever
felt
before
amid
the
weaknesses
of
the
towns
although
i
have
always
tried
to
remember
what
i
owe
to
my
dear
ay
your
mother
was
so
before
you
will
find
mabel
like
her
mother
no
screamer
or
a
girl
to
trouble
a
man
in
his
need
but
one
who
would
encourage
her
mate
and
help
to
keep
his
heart
up
when
sorest
prest
by
danger
said
the
sergeant
to
me
before
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
that
sweet
countenance
of
yours
he
did
and
why
should
my
father
have
told
you
this
pathfinder
the
girl
demanded
a
little
earnestly
perhaps
he
fancied
you
would
think
the
better
of
me
if
you
did
not
believe
me
a
silly
coward
as
so
many
of
my
sex
love
to
make
themselves
deception
unless
it
were
at
the
expense
of
his
enemies
in
the
field
nay
concealment
of
even
a
thought
was
so
little
in
accordance
with
the
pathfinder
very
nature
that
he
was
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
this
simple
question
in
such
a
strait
he
involuntarily
took
refuge
in
a
middle
course
not
revealing
that
which
he
fancied
ought
not
to
be
told
nor
yet
absolutely
concealing
it
you
must
know
mabel
said
he
that
the
sergeant
and
i
are
old
friends
and
have
stood
side
by
side
or
if
not
actually
side
by
side
i
a
little
in
advance
as
became
a
scout
and
your
father
with
his
own
men
as
better
suited
a
soldier
of
the
king
on
many
a
hard
and
bloody
day
it
the
way
of
us
skirmishers
to
think
little
of
the
fight
when
the
rifle
has
done
cracking
and
at
night
around
our
fires
or
on
our
marches
we
talk
of
the
things
we
love
just
as
you
young
women
convarse
about
your
fancies
and
opinions
when
you
get
together
to
laugh
over
your
idees
now
it
was
natural
that
the
sergeant
having
such
a
daughter
as
you
should
love
her
better
than
anything
else
and
that
he
should
talk
of
her
oftener
than
of
anything
else
while
i
having
neither
daughter
nor
sister
nor
mother
nor
kith
nor
kin
nor
anything
but
the
delawares
to
love
i
naturally
chimed
in
as
it
were
and
got
to
love
you
mabel
before
i
ever
saw
you
yes
i
did
just
by
talking
about
you
so
and
now
you
seen
me
returned
the
smiling
girl
whose
unmoved
and
natural
manner
proved
how
little
she
was
thinking
of
anything
more
than
parental
or
fraternal
regard
you
are
beginning
to
see
the
folly
of
forming
friendships
for
people
before
you
know
anything
about
them
except
by
it
was
friendship
it
is
friendship
mabel
that
i
feel
for
you
i
am
the
friend
of
the
delawares
and
have
been
so
from
boyhood
but
my
feelings
for
them
or
for
the
best
of
them
are
not
the
same
as
those
i
got
from
the
sergeant
for
you
and
especially
now
that
i
begin
to
know
you
better
i
sometimes
afeared
it
is
wholesome
for
one
who
is
much
occupied
in
a
very
manly
calling
like
that
of
a
guide
or
scout
or
a
soldier
even
to
form
friendships
for
women
young
women
in
particular
as
they
seem
to
me
to
lessen
the
love
of
enterprise
and
to
turn
the
feelings
away
from
their
gifts
and
natural
you
surely
do
not
mean
pathfinder
that
a
friendship
for
a
girl
like
me
would
make
you
less
bold
and
more
unwilling
to
meet
the
french
than
you
were
before
not
so
not
so
with
you
in
danger
for
instance
i
fear
i
might
become
foolhardy
but
before
we
became
so
intimate
as
i
may
say
i
loved
to
think
of
my
scoutings
and
of
my
marches
and
outlyings
and
fights
and
other
adventures
but
now
my
mind
cares
less
about
them
i
think
more
of
the
barracks
and
of
evenings
passed
in
discourse
of
feelings
in
which
there
are
no
wranglings
and
bloodshed
and
of
young
women
and
of
their
laughs
and
their
cheerful
soft
voices
their
pleasant
looks
and
their
winning
ways
i
sometimes
tell
the
sergeant
that
he
and
his
daughter
will
be
the
spoiling
of
one
of
the
best
and
most
experienced
scouts
on
the
not
they
pathfinder
they
will
try
to
make
that
which
is
already
so
excellent
perfect
you
do
not
know
us
if
you
think
that
either
wishes
to
see
you
in
the
least
changed
remain
as
at
present
the
same
honest
upright
conscientious
fearless
intelligent
trustworthy
guide
that
you
are
and
neither
my
dear
father
nor
myself
can
ever
think
of
you
differently
from
what
we
now
it
was
too
dark
for
mabel
to
note
the
workings
of
the
countenance
of
her
listener
but
her
own
sweet
face
was
turned
towards
him
as
she
spoke
with
an
energy
equal
to
her
frankness
in
a
way
to
show
how
little
embarrassed
were
her
thoughts
and
how
sincere
were
her
words
her
countenance
was
a
little
flushed
it
is
true
but
it
was
with
earnestness
and
truth
of
feeling
though
no
nerve
thrilled
no
limb
trembled
no
pulsation
quickened
in
short
her
manner
and
appearance
were
those
of
a
and
frank
girl
making
such
a
declaration
of
and
regard
for
one
of
the
other
sex
as
she
felt
that
his
services
and
good
qualities
merited
without
any
of
the
emotion
that
invariably
accompanies
the
consciousness
of
an
inclination
which
might
lead
to
softer
disclosures
the
pathfinder
was
too
unpractised
however
to
enter
into
distinctions
of
this
kind
and
his
humble
nature
was
encouraged
by
the
directness
and
strength
of
the
words
he
had
just
heard
unwilling
if
not
unable
to
say
any
more
he
walked
away
and
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
and
looking
up
at
the
stars
for
full
ten
minutes
in
profound
silence
in
the
meanwhile
the
interview
on
the
bastion
to
which
we
have
already
alluded
took
place
between
lundie
and
the
sergeant
have
the
men
knapsacks
been
examined
demanded
major
duncan
after
he
had
cast
his
eye
at
a
written
report
handed
to
him
by
the
sergeant
but
which
it
was
too
dark
to
read
all
your
honor
and
all
are
the
ammunition
arms
all
in
order
major
duncan
and
fit
for
any
you
have
the
men
named
in
my
own
draft
dunham
without
an
exception
sir
better
men
could
not
be
found
in
the
you
have
need
of
the
best
of
our
men
sergeant
this
experiment
has
now
been
tried
three
times
always
under
one
of
the
ensigns
who
have
flattered
me
with
success
but
have
as
often
failed
after
so
much
preparation
and
expense
i
do
not
like
to
abandon
the
project
entirely
but
this
will
be
the
last
effort
and
the
result
will
mainly
depend
on
you
and
on
the
you
may
count
on
us
both
major
duncan
the
duty
you
have
given
us
is
not
above
our
habits
and
experience
and
i
think
it
will
be
well
done
i
know
that
the
pathfinder
will
not
be
on
that
indeed
it
will
be
safe
to
rely
he
is
a
most
extraordinary
man
dunham
one
who
long
puzzled
me
but
who
now
that
i
understand
him
commands
as
much
of
my
respect
as
any
general
in
his
i
was
in
hopes
sir
that
you
would
come
to
look
at
the
proposed
marriage
with
mabel
as
a
thing
i
ought
to
wish
and
as
for
that
sergeant
time
will
show
returned
lundie
smiling
though
here
too
the
obscurity
concealed
the
nicer
shades
of
expression
one
woman
is
sometimes
more
difficult
to
manage
than
a
whole
regiment
of
men
by
the
way
you
know
that
your
the
quartermaster
will
be
of
the
party
and
i
trust
you
will
at
least
give
him
an
equal
chance
in
the
trial
for
your
if
respect
for
his
rank
sir
did
not
cause
me
to
do
this
your
wish
would
be
i
thank
you
sergeant
we
have
served
much
together
and
ought
to
value
each
other
in
our
several
stations
understand
me
however
i
ask
no
more
for
davy
muir
than
a
clear
field
and
no
favor
in
love
as
in
war
each
man
must
gain
his
own
victories
are
you
certain
that
the
rations
have
been
properly
calculated
i
answer
for
it
major
duncan
but
if
they
were
not
we
can
not
suffer
with
two
such
hunters
as
pathfinder
and
the
serpent
in
that
will
never
do
dunham
interrupted
lundie
sharply
and
it
comes
of
your
american
birth
and
american
training
no
thorough
soldier
ever
relies
on
anything
but
his
commissary
for
supplies
and
i
beg
that
no
part
of
my
regiment
may
be
the
first
to
set
an
example
to
the
you
have
only
to
command
major
duncan
to
be
obeyed
and
yet
if
i
might
presume
sir
speak
freely
sergeant
you
are
talking
with
a
i
was
merely
about
to
say
that
i
find
even
the
scotch
soldiers
like
venison
and
birds
quite
as
well
as
pork
when
they
are
difficult
to
be
that
may
be
very
true
but
likes
and
dislikes
have
nothing
to
do
with
system
an
army
can
rely
on
nothing
but
its
commissaries
the
irregularity
of
the
provincials
has
played
the
devil
with
the
service
too
often
to
be
winked
at
any
general
braddock
your
honor
might
have
been
advised
by
colonel
out
upon
your

you
all
provincials
together
man
and
uphold
each
other
as
if
you

your
in
that
dunham
i
thinking
you
right
and
i
have
been
a
little
too
warm
perhaps
i
do
not
consider
a
provincial
however
sergeant
for
though
born
in
america
a
better
soldier
never
shouldered
a
and
colonel
washington
your
honor
well
and
colonel
washington
may
be
a
useful
subject
too
he
is
the
american
prodigy
and
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
give
him
all
the
credit
you
ask
you
have
no
doubt
of
the
skill
of
this
jasper
the
boy
has
been
tried
sir
and
found
equal
to
all
that
can
be
required
of
he
has
a
french
name
and
has
passed
much
of
his
boyhood
in
the
french
colonies
has
he
french
blood
in
his
veins
sergeant
not
a
drop
your
honor
jasper
father
was
an
old
comrade
of
my
own
and
his
mother
came
of
an
honest
and
loyal
family
in
this
very
how
came
he
then
so
much
among
the
french
and
whence
his
name
he
speaks
the
language
of
the
canadas
too
i
that
is
easily
explained
major
duncan
the
boy
was
left
under
the
care
of
one
of
our
mariners
in
the
old
war
and
he
took
to
the
water
like
a
duck
your
honor
knows
that
we
have
no
ports
on
ontario
that
can
be
named
as
such
and
he
naturally
passed
most
of
his
time
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
where
the
french
have
had
a
few
vessels
these
fifty
years
he
learned
to
speak
their
language
as
a
matter
of
course
and
got
his
name
from
the
indians
and
canadians
who
are
fond
of
calling
men
by
their
qualities
as
it
might
a
french
master
is
but
a
poor
instructor
for
a
british
sailor
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
jasper
was
brought
up
under
a
real
english
seaman
one
that
had
sailed
under
the
king
pennant
and
may
be
called
a
that
is
to
say
a
subject
born
in
the
colonies
but
none
the
worse
at
his
trade
i
hope
major
duncan
for
perhaps
not
sergeant
perhaps
not
nor
any
better
this
jasper
behaved
well
too
when
i
gave
him
the
command
of
the
no
lad
could
have
conducted
himself
more
loyally
or
or
more
bravely
major
duncan
i
am
sorry
to
see
sir
that
you
have
doubts
as
to
the
fidelity
of
it
is
the
duty
of
the
soldier
who
is
entrusted
with
the
care
of
a
distant
and
important
post
like
this
dunham
never
to
relax
in
his
vigilance
we
have
two
of
the
most
artful
enemies
that
the
world
has
ever
produced
in
their
several
ways
to
contend
with
the
indians
and
the
french
and
nothing
should
be
overlooked
that
can
lead
to
i
hope
your
honor
considers
me
fit
to
be
entrusted
with
any
particular
reason
that
may
exist
for
doubting
jasper
since
you
have
seen
fit
to
entrust
me
with
this
it
is
not
that
i
doubt
you
dunham
that
i
hesitate
to
reveal
all
i
may
happen
to
know
but
from
a
strong
reluctance
to
circulate
an
evil
report
concerning
one
of
whom
i
have
hitherto
thought
well
you
must
think
well
of
the
pathfinder
or
you
would
not
wish
to
give
him
your
daughter
for
the
pathfinder
honesty
i
will
answer
with
my
life
sir
returned
the
sergeant
firmly
and
not
without
a
dignity
of
manner
that
struck
his
superior
such
a
man
does
know
how
to
be
i
believe
you
are
right
dunham
and
yet
this
last
information
has
unsettled
all
my
old
opinions
i
have
received
an
anonymous
communication
sergeant
advising
me
to
be
on
my
guard
against
jasper
western
or
jasper
as
he
is
called
who
it
alleges
has
been
bought
by
the
enemy
and
giving
me
reason
to
expect
that
further
and
more
precise
information
will
soon
be
letters
without
signatures
to
them
sir
are
scarcely
to
be
regarded
in
or
in
peace
dunham
no
one
can
entertain
a
lower
opinion
of
the
writer
of
an
anonymous
letter
in
ordinary
matters
than
myself
the
very
act
denotes
cowardice
meanness
and
baseness
and
it
usually
is
a
token
of
falsehood
as
well
as
of
other
vices
but
in
matters
of
war
it
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing
besides
several
suspicious
circumstances
have
been
pointed
out
to
such
as
is
fit
for
an
orderly
to
hear
your
honor
certainly
one
in
whom
i
confide
as
much
as
in
yourself
dunham
it
is
said
for
instance
that
your
daughter
and
her
party
were
permitted
to
escape
the
iroquois
when
they
came
in
merely
to
give
jasper
credit
with
me
i
am
told
that
the
gentry
at
frontenac
will
care
more
for
the
capture
of
the
with
sergeant
dunham
and
a
party
of
men
together
with
the
defeat
of
our
favorite
plan
than
for
the
capture
of
a
girl
and
the
scalp
of
her
i
understand
the
hint
sir
but
i
do
not
give
it
credit
jasper
can
hardly
be
true
and
pathfinder
false
and
as
for
the
last
i
would
as
soon
distrust
your
honor
as
distrust
it
would
seem
so
sergeant
it
would
indeed
seem
so
but
jasper
is
not
the
pathfinder
after
all
and
i
will
own
dunham
i
should
put
more
faith
in
the
lad
if
he
did
speak
it
no
recommendation
in
my
eyes
i
assure
your
honor
but
the
boy
learned
it
by
compulsion
as
it
were
and
ought
not
to
be
condemned
too
hastily
for
the
circumstance
by
your
honor
it
a
d
d
lingo
and
never
did
any
one
good
at
least
no
british
subject
for
i
suppose
the
french
themselves
must
talk
together
in
some
language
or
other
i
should
have
much
more
faith
in
this
jasper
did
he
know
nothing
of
their
language
this
letter
has
made
me
uneasy
and
were
there
another
to
whom
i
could
trust
the
cutter
i
would
devise
some
means
to
detain
him
here
i
have
spoken
to
you
already
of
a
who
goes
with
you
sergeant
and
who
is
a
sailor
a
real
seafaring
man
your
honor
and
somewhat
prejudiced
against
fresh
water
i
doubt
if
he
could
be
induced
to
risk
his
character
on
a
lake
and
i
certain
he
never
could
find
the
the
last
is
probably
true
and
then
the
man
can
not
know
enough
of
this
treacherous
lake
to
be
fit
for
the
employment
you
will
have
to
be
doubly
vigilant
dunham
i
give
you
full
powers
and
should
you
detect
this
jasper
in
any
treachery
make
him
a
sacrifice
at
once
to
offended
being
in
the
service
of
the
crown
your
honor
he
is
amenable
to
martial
very
true
then
iron
him
from
his
head
to
his
heels
and
send
him
up
here
in
his
own
cutter
that
of
yours
must
be
able
to
find
the
way
back
after
he
has
once
travelled
the
i
make
no
doubt
major
duncan
we
shall
be
able
to
do
all
that
will
be
necessary
should
jasper
turn
out
as
you
seem
to
anticipate
though
i
think
i
would
risk
my
life
on
his
i
like
your
confidence
it
speaks
well
for
the
fellow
but
that
infernal
letter
there
is
such
an
air
of
truth
about
it
nay
there
is
so
much
truth
in
it
touching
other
i
think
your
honor
said
it
wanted
the
name
at
the
bottom
a
great
omission
for
an
honest
man
to
quite
right
dunham
and
no
one
but
a
rascal
and
a
cowardly
rascal
in
the
bargain
would
write
an
anonymous
letter
on
private
affairs
it
is
different
however
in
war
despatches
are
feigned
and
artifice
is
generally
allowed
to
be
military
manly
artifices
sir
if
you
will
such
as
ambushes
surprises
feints
false
attacks
and
even
spies
but
i
never
heard
of
a
true
soldier
who
could
wish
to
undermine
the
character
of
an
honest
young
man
by
such
means
as
i
have
met
with
many
strange
events
and
some
stranger
people
in
the
course
of
my
experience
but
fare
you
well
sergeant
i
must
detain
you
no
longer
you
are
now
on
your
guard
and
i
recommend
to
you
untiring
vigilance
i
think
muir
means
shortly
to
retire
and
should
you
fully
succeed
in
this
enterprise
my
influence
will
not
be
wanting
in
endeavoring
to
put
you
in
the
vacancy
to
which
you
have
many
i
humbly
thank
your
honor
coolly
returned
the
sergeant
who
had
been
encouraged
in
this
manner
any
time
for
the
twenty
preceding
years
and
hope
i
shall
never
disgrace
my
station
whatever
it
may
be
i
am
what
nature
and
providence
have
made
me
and
hope
i
you
have
not
forgotten
the
howitzer
jasper
took
it
on
board
this
morning
be
wary
and
do
not
trust
that
man
unnecessarily
make
a
confidant
of
pathfinder
at
once
he
may
be
of
service
in
detecting
any
villainy
that
may
be
stirring
his
simple
honesty
will
favor
his
observation
by
concealing
it
he
be
for
him
sir
my
own
head
shall
answer
or
even
my
rank
in
the
regiment
i
have
seen
him
too
often
tried
to
doubt
of
all
wretched
sensations
dunham
distrust
where
one
is
compelled
to
confide
is
the
most
painful
you
have
bethought
you
of
the
spare
flints
a
sergeant
is
a
safe
commander
for
all
such
details
your
well
then
give
me
your
hand
dunham
god
bless
you
and
may
you
be
successful
muir
means
to
retire
by
the
way
let
the
man
have
an
equal
chance
with
your
daughter
for
it
may
facilitate
future
operations
about
the
promotion
one
would
retire
more
cheerfully
with
such
a
companion
as
mabel
than
in
cheerless
widowhood
and
with
nothing
but
oneself
to
love
and
such
a
self
too
as
davy
i
hope
sir
my
child
will
make
a
prudent
choice
and
i
think
her
mind
is
already
pretty
much
made
up
in
favor
of
pathfinder
still
she
shall
have
fair
play
though
disobedience
is
the
next
crime
to
have
all
the
ammunition
carefully
examined
and
dried
as
soon
as
you
arrive
the
damp
of
the
lake
may
affect
it
and
now
once
more
farewell
sergeant
beware
of
that
jasper
and
consult
with
muir
in
any
difficulty
i
shall
expect
you
to
return
triumphant
this
day
god
bless
your
honor
if
anything
should
happen
to
me
i
trust
to
you
major
duncan
to
care
for
an
old
soldier
rely
on
me
dunham
you
will
rely
on
a
friend
be
vigilant
remember
you
will
be
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
lion
pshaw
of
no
lion
neither
but
of
treacherous
tigers
in
their
very
jaws
and
beyond
support
have
the
flints
counted
and
examined
in
the
morning
and
farewell
dunham
farewell
the
sergeant
took
the
extended
hand
of
his
superior
with
proper
respect
and
they
finally
parted
lundie
hastening
into
his
own
movable
abode
while
the
other
left
the
fort
descended
to
the
beach
and
got
into
a
boat
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
sergeant
dunham
after
he
had
parted
from
his
commanding
officer
was
likely
to
forget
the
injunctions
he
had
received
he
thought
highly
of
jasper
in
general
but
distrust
had
been
insinuated
between
his
former
confidence
and
the
obligations
of
duty
and
as
he
now
felt
that
everything
depended
on
his
own
vigilance
by
the
time
the
boat
reached
the
side
of
the
he
was
in
a
proper
humor
to
let
no
suspicious
circumstance
go
unheeded
or
any
unusual
movement
in
the
young
sailor
pass
without
its
comment
as
a
matter
of
course
he
viewed
things
in
the
light
suited
to
his
peculiar
mood
and
his
precautions
as
well
as
his
distrust
partook
of
the
habits
opinions
and
education
of
the
man
the
kedge
was
lifted
as
soon
as
the
boat
with
the
sergeant
who
was
the
last
person
expected
was
seen
to
quit
the
shore
and
the
head
of
the
cutter
was
cast
to
the
eastward
by
means
of
the
sweeps
a
few
vigorous
strokes
of
the
latter
in
which
the
soldiers
aided
now
sent
the
light
craft
into
the
line
or
the
current
that
flowed
from
the
river
when
she
was
suffered
to
drift
into
the
offing
again
as
yet
there
was
no
wind
the
light
and
almost
imperceptible
air
from
the
lake
that
had
existed
previously
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
having
entirely
failed
all
this
time
an
unusual
quiet
prevailed
in
the
cutter
it
appeared
as
if
those
on
board
of
her
felt
that
they
were
entering
upon
an
uncertain
enterprise
in
the
obscurity
of
night
and
that
their
duty
the
hour
and
the
manner
of
their
departure
lent
a
solemnity
to
their
movements
discipline
also
came
in
aid
of
these
feelings
most
were
silent
and
those
who
did
speak
spoke
seldom
and
in
low
voices
in
this
manner
the
cutter
set
slowly
out
into
the
lake
until
she
had
got
as
far
as
the
river
current
would
carry
her
when
she
became
stationary
waiting
for
the
usual
an
interval
of
half
an
hour
followed
during
the
whole
of
which
time
the
lay
as
motionless
as
a
log
floating
on
the
water
while
the
little
changes
just
mentioned
were
occurring
in
the
situation
of
the
vessel
notwithstanding
the
general
quiet
that
prevailed
all
conversation
had
not
been
repressed
for
sergeant
dunham
having
first
ascertained
that
both
his
daughter
and
her
female
companion
were
on
the
led
the
pathfinder
to
the
where
closing
the
door
with
great
caution
and
otherwise
making
certain
that
he
was
beyond
the
reach
of
eavesdroppers
he
commenced
as
follows
it
is
now
many
years
my
friend
since
you
began
to
experience
the
hardships
and
dangers
of
the
woods
in
my
it
is
sergeant
yes
it
is
i
sometimes
fear
i
am
too
old
for
mabel
who
was
not
born
until
you
and
i
had
fought
the
frenchers
as
no
fear
on
that
account
pathfinder
i
was
near
your
age
before
i
prevailed
on
the
mind
of
her
mother
and
mabel
is
a
steady
thoughtful
girl
one
that
will
regard
character
more
than
anything
else
a
lad
like
jasper
for
instance
will
have
no
chance
with
her
though
he
is
both
young
and
does
jasper
think
of
marrying
inquired
the
guide
simply
but
earnestly
i
should
hope
not
at
least
not
until
he
has
satisfied
every
one
of
his
fitness
to
possess
a
jasper
is
a
gallant
boy
and
one
of
great
gifts
in
his
way
he
may
claim
a
wife
as
well
as
to
be
frank
with
you
pathfinder
i
brought
you
here
to
talk
about
this
very
youngster
major
duncan
has
received
some
information
which
has
led
him
to
suspect
that
is
false
and
in
the
pay
of
the
enemy
i
wish
to
hear
your
opinion
on
the
anan
i
say
the
major
suspects
jasper
of
being
a
traitor
a
french
spy
or
what
is
worse
of
being
bought
to
betray
us
he
has
received
a
letter
to
this
effect
and
has
been
charging
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
movements
for
he
fears
we
shall
meet
with
enemies
when
we
least
suspect
it
and
by
his
duncan
of
lundie
has
told
you
this
sergeant
dunham
he
has
indeed
pathfinder
and
though
i
have
been
loath
to
believe
anything
to
the
injury
of
jasper
i
have
a
feeling
which
tells
me
i
ought
to
distrust
him
do
you
believe
in
presentiments
my
friend
in
what
sergeant
presentiments
a
sort
of
secret
foreknowledge
of
events
that
are
about
to
happen
the
scotch
of
our
regiment
are
great
sticklers
for
such
things
and
my
opinion
of
jasper
is
changing
so
fast
that
i
begin
to
fear
there
must
be
some
truth
in
their
but
you
been
talking
with
duncan
of
lundie
concerning
jasper
and
his
words
have
raised
not
it
not
so
in
the
least
for
while
conversing
with
the
major
my
feelings
were
altogether
the
other
way
and
i
endeavored
to
convince
him
all
i
could
that
he
did
the
boy
injustice
but
there
is
no
use
in
holding
out
against
a
presentiment
i
find
and
i
fear
there
is
something
in
the
suspicion
after
i
know
nothing
of
presentiments
sergeant
but
i
have
known
jasper
since
he
was
a
boy
and
i
have
as
much
faith
in
his
honesty
as
i
have
in
my
own
or
that
of
the
sarpent
but
the
serpent
pathfinder
has
his
tricks
and
ambushes
in
war
as
well
as
ay
them
are
his
gifts
and
are
such
as
belong
to
his
people
neither
nor
can
deny
natur
but
chingachgook
is
not
a
man
to
feel
a
presentiment
that
i
believe
nor
should
i
have
thought
ill
of
jasper
this
very
morning
it
seems
to
me
pathfinder
since
i
taken
up
this
presentiment
that
the
lad
does
not
bustle
about
his
deck
naturally
as
he
used
to
do
but
that
he
is
silent
and
moody
and
thoughtful
like
a
man
who
has
a
load
on
his
jasper
is
never
noisy
and
he
tells
me
noisy
ships
are
generally
ships
master
cap
agrees
in
this
too
no
no
i
will
believe
naught
against
jasper
until
i
see
it
send
for
your
brother
sergeant
and
let
us
question
him
in
this
matter
for
to
sleep
with
distrust
of
one
friend
in
the
heart
is
like
sleeping
with
lead
there
i
have
no
faith
in
your
the
sergeant
although
he
scarcely
knew
himself
with
what
object
complied
and
cap
was
summoned
to
join
in
the
consultation
as
pathfinder
was
more
collected
than
his
companion
and
felt
so
strong
a
conviction
of
the
good
faith
of
the
party
accused
he
assumed
the
office
of
spokesman
we
have
asked
you
to
come
down
master
cap
he
commenced
in
order
to
inquire
if
you
have
remarked
anything
out
of
the
common
way
in
the
movements
of
this
his
movements
are
common
enough
i
daresay
for
fresh
water
master
pathfinder
though
we
should
think
most
of
his
proceedings
irregular
down
on
the
yes
yes
we
know
you
will
never
agree
with
the
lad
about
the
manner
the
cutter
ought
to
be
managed
but
it
is
on
another
point
we
wish
your
the
pathfinder
then
explained
to
cap
the
nature
of
the
suspicions
which
the
sergeant
entertained
and
the
reasons
why
they
had
been
excited
so
far
as
the
latter
had
been
communicated
by
major
duncan
the
youngster
talks
french
does
he
said
cap
they
say
he
speaks
it
better
than
common
returned
the
sergeant
gravely
pathfinder
knows
this
to
be
i
not
gainsay
it
answered
the
guide
at
least
they
tell
me
such
is
the
fact
but
this
would
prove
nothing
a
mississauga
and
least
of
all
one
like
jasper
i
speak
the
mingo
dialect
myself
having
learnt
it
while
a
prisoner
among
the
reptyles
but
who
will
say
i
am
their
friend
not
that
i
am
an
enemy
either
according
to
indian
notions
though
i
am
their
enemy
i
will
admit
agreeable
to
ay
pathfinder
but
jasper
did
not
get
his
french
as
a
prisoner
he
took
it
in
his
boyhood
when
the
mind
is
easily
impressed
and
gets
its
permanent
notions
when
nature
has
a
presentiment
as
it
were
which
way
the
character
is
likely
to
a
very
just
remark
added
cap
for
that
is
the
time
of
life
when
we
all
learn
the
catechism
and
other
moral
improvements
the
observation
shows
that
he
understands
human
nature
and
i
agree
with
him
perfectly
it
a
damnable
thing
for
a
youngster
up
here
on
this
bit
of
fresh
water
to
talk
french
if
it
were
down
on
the
atlantic
now
where
a
seafaring
man
has
occasion
sometimes
to
converse
with
a
pilot
or
a
linguister
in
that
language
i
should
not
think
so
much
of
it
though
we
always
look
with
suspicion
even
there
at
a
shipmate
who
knows
too
much
of
the
tongue
but
up
here
on
ontario
i
hold
it
to
be
a
most
suspicious
but
jasper
must
talk
in
french
to
the
people
on
the
other
shore
said
pathfinder
or
hold
his
tongue
as
there
are
none
but
french
to
speak
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
pathfinder
that
france
lies
hereaway
on
the
opposite
coast
cried
cap
jerking
a
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
the
canadas
that
one
side
of
this
bit
of
fresh
water
is
york
and
the
other
france
i
mean
to
tell
you
this
is
york
and
that
is
upper
canada
and
that
english
and
dutch
and
indian
are
spoken
in
the
first
and
french
and
indian
in
the
last
even
the
mingos
have
got
many
of
the
french
words
in
their
dialect
and
it
is
no
improvement
very
true
and
what
sort
of
people
are
the
mingos
my
friend
inquired
the
sergeant
touching
the
other
on
his
shoulder
by
way
of
enforcing
a
remark
the
inherent
truth
of
which
sensibly
increased
its
value
in
the
eyes
of
the
speaker
no
one
knows
them
better
than
yourself
and
i
ask
you
what
sort
of
a
tribe
are
they
jasper
is
no
mingo
he
speaks
french
and
he
might
as
well
be
in
that
particular
brother
cap
can
you
recollect
no
movement
of
this
unfortunate
young
man
in
the
way
of
his
calling
that
would
seem
to
denote
treachery
not
distinctly
sergeant
though
he
has
gone
to
work
foremost
half
his
time
it
is
true
that
one
of
his
hands
coiled
a
rope
against
the
sun
and
he
called
it
a
rope
too
when
i
asked
him
what
he
was
about
but
i
am
not
certain
that
anything
was
meant
by
it
though
i
daresay
the
french
coil
half
their
running
rigging
the
wrong
way
and
may
call
it
it
down
too
for
that
matter
then
jasper
himself
belayed
the
end
of
the
to
a
stretcher
in
the
rigging
instead
of
bringing
it
to
the
mast
where
they
belong
at
least
among
british
i
daresay
jasper
may
have
got
some
canada
notions
about
working
his
craft
from
being
so
much
on
the
other
side
pathfinder
interposed
but
catching
an
idee
or
a
word
is
treachery
and
bad
faith
i
sometimes
get
an
idee
from
the
mingos
themselves
but
my
heart
has
always
been
with
the
delawares
no
no
jasper
is
true
and
the
king
might
trust
him
with
his
crown
just
as
he
would
trust
his
eldest
son
who
as
he
is
to
wear
it
one
day
ought
to
be
the
last
man
to
wish
to
steal
fine
talking
fine
talking
said
cap
all
fine
talking
master
pathfinder
but
d
d
little
logic
in
the
first
place
the
majesty
can
not
lend
his
crown
it
being
contrary
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
which
require
him
to
wear
it
at
all
times
in
order
that
his
sacred
person
may
be
known
just
as
the
silver
oar
is
necessary
to
a
sheriff
officer
afloat
in
the
next
place
it
high
treason
by
law
for
the
eldest
son
of
his
majesty
ever
to
covet
the
crown
or
to
have
a
child
except
in
lawful
wedlock
as
either
would
derange
the
succession
thus
you
see
friend
pathfinder
that
in
order
to
reason
truly
one
must
get
under
way
as
it
might
be
on
the
right
tack
law
is
reason
and
reason
is
philosophy
and
philosophy
is
a
steady
drag
whence
it
follows
that
crowns
are
regulated
by
law
reason
and
i
know
little
of
all
this
master
cap
but
nothing
short
of
seeing
and
feeling
will
make
me
think
jasper
western
a
there
you
are
wrong
again
pathfinder
for
there
is
a
way
of
proving
a
thing
much
more
conclusively
than
either
seeing
or
feeling
or
by
both
together
and
that
is
by
a
it
may
be
so
in
the
settlements
but
it
is
not
so
here
on
the
it
is
so
in
nature
which
is
monarch
over
all
there
was
a
circumstance
just
after
we
came
on
board
this
evening
that
is
extremely
suspicious
and
which
may
be
set
down
at
once
as
a
makeweight
against
this
lad
jasper
bent
on
the
king
ensign
with
his
own
hands
and
while
he
pretended
to
be
looking
at
mabel
and
the
soldier
wife
giving
directions
about
showing
them
below
here
and
a
that
he
got
the
flag
union
down
that
might
have
been
accident
returned
the
sergeant
for
such
a
thing
has
happened
to
myself
besides
the
halyards
lead
to
a
pulley
and
the
flag
would
have
come
right
or
not
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
lad
hoisted
a
pulley
exclaimed
cap
with
strong
disgust
i
wish
sergeant
dunham
i
could
prevail
on
you
to
use
proper
terms
an
is
no
more
a
pulley
than
your
halberd
is
a
it
is
true
that
by
hoisting
on
one
part
another
part
would
go
uppermost
but
i
look
upon
that
affair
of
the
ensign
now
you
have
mentioned
your
suspicions
as
a
circumstance
and
shall
bear
it
in
mind
i
trust
supper
is
not
to
be
overlooked
however
even
if
we
have
a
hold
full
of
it
will
be
duly
attended
to
brother
cap
but
i
shall
count
on
you
for
aid
in
managing
the
should
anything
occur
to
induce
me
to
arrest
i
not
fail
you
sergeant
and
in
such
an
event
you
probably
learn
what
this
cutter
can
really
perform
for
as
yet
i
fancy
it
is
pretty
much
matter
of
well
for
my
part
said
pathfinder
drawing
a
heavy
sigh
i
shall
cling
to
the
hope
of
jasper
innocence
and
recommend
plain
dealing
by
asking
the
lad
himself
without
further
delay
whether
he
is
or
is
not
a
traitor
i
put
jasper
western
against
all
the
presentiments
and
circumstances
in
the
that
will
never
do
rejoined
the
sergeant
the
responsibility
of
this
affair
rests
with
me
and
i
request
and
enjoin
that
nothing
be
said
to
any
one
without
my
knowledge
we
will
all
keep
watchful
eyes
about
us
and
take
proper
note
of
ay
ay
circumstances
are
the
things
after
all
returned
cap
one
circumstance
is
worth
fifty
facts
that
i
know
to
be
the
law
of
the
realm
many
a
man
has
been
hanged
on
the
conversation
now
ceased
and
after
a
short
delay
the
whole
party
returned
to
the
deck
each
individual
disposed
to
view
the
conduct
of
the
suspected
jasper
in
the
manner
most
suited
to
his
own
habits
and
character
chapter
xiv
even
such
a
man
so
faint
so
spiritless
so
dull
so
dead
in
look
so
drew
priam
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
and
would
have
told
him
half
his
troy
was
burned
shakespeare
all
this
time
matters
were
elsewhere
passing
in
their
usual
train
jasper
like
the
weather
and
his
vessel
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
while
the
soldiers
accustomed
to
early
rising
had
to
a
man
sought
their
pallets
in
the
main
hold
none
remained
on
deck
but
the
people
of
the
cutter
muir
and
the
two
females
the
quartermaster
was
endeavoring
to
render
himself
agreeable
to
mabel
while
our
heroine
herself
little
affected
by
his
assiduities
which
she
ascribed
partly
to
the
habitual
gallantry
of
a
soldier
and
partly
perhaps
to
her
own
pretty
face
was
enjoying
the
peculiarities
of
a
scene
and
situation
which
to
her
were
full
of
the
charms
of
novelty
the
sails
had
been
hoisted
but
as
yet
not
a
breath
of
air
was
in
motion
and
so
still
and
placid
was
the
lake
that
not
the
smallest
motion
was
perceptible
in
the
cutter
she
had
drifted
in
the
to
a
distance
a
little
exceeding
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
land
and
there
she
lay
beautiful
in
her
symmetry
and
form
but
like
a
fixture
young
jasper
was
on
the
near
enough
to
hear
occasionally
the
conversation
which
passed
but
too
diffident
of
his
own
claim
and
too
intent
on
his
duties
to
attempt
to
mingle
in
it
the
fine
blue
eyes
of
mabel
followed
his
motions
in
curious
expectation
and
more
than
once
the
quartermaster
had
to
repeat
his
compliments
before
she
heard
them
so
intent
was
she
on
the
little
occurrences
of
the
vessel
and
we
might
add
so
indifferent
to
the
eloquence
of
her
companion
at
length
even
muir
became
silent
and
there
was
a
deep
stillness
on
the
water
presently
an
fell
in
a
boat
beneath
the
fort
and
the
sound
reached
the
cutter
as
distinctly
as
if
it
had
been
produced
on
her
deck
then
came
a
murmur
like
a
sigh
of
the
night
a
fluttering
of
the
canvas
the
creaking
of
the
boom
and
the
flap
of
the
jib
these
sounds
were
followed
by
a
slight
heel
in
the
cutter
and
by
the
bellying
of
all
the
sails
here
the
wind
anderson
called
out
jasper
to
the
oldest
of
his
sailors
take
the
this
brief
order
was
obeyed
the
helm
was
put
up
the
cutter
bows
fell
off
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
was
heard
murmuring
under
her
head
as
the
glanced
through
the
lake
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
in
the
hour
all
this
passed
in
profound
silence
when
jasper
again
gave
the
order
to
ease
off
the
sheets
a
little
and
keep
her
along
the
it
was
at
this
instant
that
the
party
from
the
reappeared
on
the
you
no
inclination
jasper
lad
to
trust
yourself
too
near
our
neighbours
the
french
observed
muir
who
took
that
occasion
to
recommence
the
discourse
well
well
your
prudence
will
never
be
questioned
by
me
for
i
like
the
canadas
as
little
as
you
can
possibly
like
them
i
hug
this
shore
muir
on
account
of
the
wind
the
is
always
freshest
close
in
provided
you
are
not
so
near
as
to
make
a
lee
of
the
trees
we
have
mexico
bay
to
cross
and
that
on
the
present
course
will
give
us
quite
offing
i
right
glad
it
not
the
bay
of
mexico
put
in
cap
which
is
a
part
of
the
world
i
would
rather
not
visit
in
one
of
your
inland
craft
does
your
cutter
bear
a
weather
helm
master
she
is
easy
on
her
rudder
master

but
likes
looking
up
at
the
breeze
as
well
as
another
when
in
lively
i
suppose
you
have
such
things
as
reefs
though
you
can
hardly
have
occasion
to
use
them
mabel
bright
eye
detected
the
smile
that
gleamed
for
an
instant
on
jasper
handsome
face
but
no
one
else
saw
that
momentary
exhibition
of
surprise
and
contempt
we
have
reefs
and
often
have
occasion
to
use
them
quietly
returned
the
young
man
before
we
get
in
master
cap
an
opportunity
may
offer
to
show
you
the
manner
in
which
we
do
so
for
there
is
easterly
weather
brewing
and
the
wind
can
not
chop
even
on
the
ocean
itself
more
readily
than
it
flies
round
on
lake
so
much
for
knowing
no
better
i
have
seen
the
wind
in
the
atlantic
fly
round
like
a
in
a
way
to
keep
your
sails
shaking
for
an
hour
and
the
ship
would
become
perfectly
motionless
from
not
knowing
which
way
to
we
have
no
such
sudden
changes
here
certainly
jasper
mildly
answered
though
we
think
ourselves
liable
to
unexpected
shifts
of
wind
i
hope
however
to
carry
this
as
far
as
the
first
islands
after
which
there
will
be
less
danger
of
our
being
seen
and
followed
by
any
of
the
boats
from
do
you
think
the
french
keep
spies
out
on
the
broad
lake
jasper
inquired
the
pathfinder
we
know
they
do
one
was
off
oswego
during
the
night
of
monday
last
a
bark
canoe
came
close
in
with
the
eastern
point
and
landed
an
indian
and
an
officer
had
you
been
outlying
that
night
as
usual
we
should
have
secured
one
if
not
both
of
it
was
too
dark
to
betray
the
color
that
deepened
on
the
features
of
the
guide
for
he
felt
the
consciousness
of
having
lingered
in
the
fort
that
night
listening
to
the
sweet
tones
of
mabel
voice
as
she
sang
ballads
to
her
father
and
gazing
at
the
countenance
which
to
him
was
radiant
with
charms
probity
in
thought
and
deed
being
the
distinguishing
quality
of
this
extraordinary
man
mind
while
he
felt
that
a
sort
of
disgrace
ought
to
attach
to
his
idleness
on
the
occasion
mentioned
the
last
thought
that
could
occur
would
be
to
attempt
to
palliate
or
deny
his
negligence
i
confess
it
jasper
i
confess
it
said
he
humbly
had
i
been
out
that
night
and
i
now
recollect
no
sufficient
reason
why
i
was
not
it
might
indeed
have
turned
out
as
you
it
was
the
evening
you
passed
with
us
pathfinder
mabel
innocently
remarked
surely
one
who
lives
so
much
of
his
time
in
the
forest
in
front
of
the
enemy
may
be
excused
for
giving
a
few
hours
of
his
time
to
an
old
friend
and
his
nay
nay
i
done
little
else
but
idle
since
we
reached
the
garrison
returned
the
other
sighing
and
it
is
well
that
the
lad
should
tell
me
of
it
the
idler
needs
a
rebuke
yes
he
needs
a
rebuke
pathfinder
i
never
dreamt
of
saying
anything
disagreeable
and
least
of
all
would
i
think
of
rebuking
you
because
a
solitary
spy
and
an
indian
or
two
have
escaped
us
now
i
know
where
you
were
i
think
your
absence
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
i
think
nothing
of
what
you
said
jasper
since
it
was
deserved
we
are
all
human
and
all
do
this
is
unkind
give
me
your
hand
lad
give
me
your
hand
it
was
you
that
gave
the
lesson
it
was
well
well
interrupted
cap
now
this
latter
matter
is
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
how
it
happened
to
be
known
that
there
were
spies
near
us
so
lately
this
looks
amazingly
like
a
as
the
mariner
uttered
the
last
sentence
he
pressed
a
foot
slily
on
that
of
the
sergeant
and
nudged
the
guide
with
his
elbow
winking
at
the
same
time
though
this
sign
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
it
is
known
because
their
trail
was
found
next
day
by
the
serpent
and
it
was
that
of
a
military
boot
and
a
moccasin
one
of
our
hunters
moreover
saw
the
canoe
crossing
towards
frontenac
next
did
the
trail
lead
near
the
garrison
jasper
pathfinder
asked
in
a
manner
so
meek
and
subdued
that
it
resembled
the
tone
of
a
rebuked
schoolboy
did
the
trail
lead
near
the
garrison
lad
we
thought
not
though
of
course
it
did
not
cross
the
river
it
was
followed
down
to
the
eastern
point
at
the
river
mouth
where
what
was
doing
in
port
might
be
seen
but
it
did
not
cross
as
we
could
and
why
did
you
get
under
weigh
master
jasper
cap
demanded
and
give
chase
on
tuesday
morning
it
blew
a
good
breeze
one
in
which
this
cutter
might
have
run
nine
that
may
do
on
the
ocean
master
cap
put
in
pathfinder
but
it
would
not
do
here
water
leaves
no
trail
and
a
mingo
and
a
frenchman
are
a
match
for
the
devil
in
a
who
wants
a
trail
when
the
chase
can
be
seen
from
the
deck
as
jasper
here
said
was
the
case
with
this
canoe
and
it
mattered
nothing
if
there
were
twenty
of
your
mingos
and
frenchmen
with
a
good
bottom
in
their
wake
i
engage
master
had
you
given
me
a
call
that
said
tuesday
morning
that
we
should
have
overhauled
the
i
daresay
master
cap
that
the
advice
of
as
old
a
seaman
as
you
might
have
done
no
harm
to
as
young
a
sailor
as
myself
but
it
is
a
long
and
a
hopeless
chase
that
has
a
bark
canoe
in
you
would
have
had
only
to
press
it
hard
to
drive
it
ashore
master
cap
you
do
not
understand
our
lake
navigation
at
all
if
you
suppose
it
an
easy
matter
to
force
a
bark
canoe
ashore
as
soon
as
they
find
themselves
pressed
these
bubbles
paddle
right
into
the
wind
eye
and
before
you
know
it
you
find
yourself
a
mile
or
two
dead
under
their
you
do
wish
me
to
believe
master
jasper
that
any
one
is
so
heedless
of
drowning
as
to
put
off
into
this
lake
in
one
of
them
eggshells
when
there
is
any
wind
i
have
often
crossed
ontario
in
a
bark
canoe
even
when
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
sea
on
well
managed
they
are
the
driest
boats
of
which
we
have
any
cap
now
led
his
and
pathfinder
aside
when
he
assured
him
that
the
admission
of
jasper
concerning
the
spies
was
a
circumstance
and
a
strong
circumstance
and
as
such
it
deserved
his
deliberate
investigation
while
his
account
of
the
canoes
was
so
improbable
as
to
wear
the
appearance
of
the
listeners
jasper
spoke
confidently
of
the
character
of
the
two
individuals
who
had
landed
and
this
cap
deemed
pretty
strong
proof
that
he
knew
more
about
them
than
was
to
be
gathered
from
a
mere
trail
as
for
moccasins
he
said
that
they
were
worn
in
that
part
of
the
world
by
white
men
as
well
as
by
indians
he
had
purchased
a
pair
himself
and
boots
it
was
notorious
did
not
particularly
make
a
soldier
although
much
of
this
logic
was
thrown
away
on
the
sergeant
still
it
produced
some
effect
he
thought
it
a
little
singular
himself
that
there
should
have
been
spies
detected
so
near
the
fort
and
he
know
nothing
of
it
nor
did
he
believe
that
this
was
a
branch
of
knowledge
that
fell
particularly
within
the
sphere
of
jasper
it
was
true
that
the
had
once
or
twice
been
sent
across
the
lake
to
land
men
of
this
character
or
to
bring
them
off
but
then
the
part
played
by
jasper
to
his
own
certain
knowledge
was
very
secondary
the
master
of
the
cutter
remaining
as
ignorant
as
any
one
else
of
the
purport
of
the
visits
of
those
whom
he
had
carried
to
and
fro
nor
did
he
see
why
he
alone
of
all
present
should
know
anything
of
the
late
visit
pathfinder
viewed
the
matter
differently
with
his
habitual
diffidence
he
reproached
himself
with
a
neglect
of
duty
and
that
knowledge
of
which
the
want
struck
him
as
a
fault
in
one
whose
business
it
was
to
possess
it
appeared
a
merit
in
the
young
man
he
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
jasper
knowing
the
facts
he
had
related
while
he
did
feel
it
was
unusual
not
to
say
disgraceful
that
he
himself
now
heard
of
them
for
the
first
time
as
for
moccasins
master
cap
said
he
when
a
short
pause
invited
him
to
speak
they
may
be
worn
by
as
well
as
by
it
is
true
though
they
never
leave
the
same
trail
on
the
foot
of
one
as
on
the
foot
of
the
other
any
one
who
is
used
to
the
woods
can
tell
the
footstep
of
an
indian
from
the
footstep
of
a
white
man
whether
it
be
made
by
a
boot
or
a
moccasin
it
will
need
better
evidence
than
this
to
persuade
me
into
the
belief
that
jasper
is
you
will
allow
pathfinder
that
there
are
such
things
in
the
world
as
traitors
put
in
cap
logically
i
never
knew
an
mingo
one
that
you
could
put
faith
in
if
he
had
a
temptation
to
deceive
you
cheating
seems
to
be
their
gift
and
i
sometimes
think
they
ought
to
be
pitied
for
it
rather
than
then
why
not
believe
that
this
jasper
may
have
the
same
weakness
a
man
is
a
man
and
human
nature
is
sometimes
but
a
poor
concern
as
i
know
by
this
was
the
opening
of
another
long
and
desultory
conversation
in
which
the
probability
of
jasper
guilt
or
innocence
was
argued
and
until
both
the
sergeant
and
his
had
nearly
reasoned
themselves
into
settled
convictions
in
favor
of
the
first
while
their
companion
grew
sturdier
and
sturdier
in
his
defence
of
the
accused
and
still
more
fixed
in
his
opinion
of
his
being
unjustly
charged
with
treachery
in
this
there
was
nothing
out
of
the
common
course
of
things
for
there
is
no
more
certain
way
of
arriving
at
any
particular
notion
than
by
undertaking
to
defend
it
and
among
the
most
obstinate
of
our
opinions
may
be
classed
those
which
are
derived
from
discussions
in
which
we
affect
to
search
for
truth
while
in
reality
we
are
only
fortifying
prejudice
by
this
time
the
sergeant
had
reached
a
state
of
mind
that
disposed
him
to
view
every
act
of
the
young
sailor
with
distrust
and
he
soon
got
to
coincide
with
his
relative
in
deeming
the
peculiar
knowledge
of
jasper
in
reference
to
the
spies
a
branch
of
information
that
certainly
did
not
come
within
the
circle
of
his
regular
duties
as
a
while
this
matter
was
thus
discussed
near
the
taffrail
mabel
sat
silently
by
the
muir
having
gone
below
to
look
after
his
personal
comforts
and
jasper
standing
a
little
aloof
with
his
arms
crossed
and
his
eyes
wandering
from
the
sails
to
the
clouds
from
the
clouds
to
the
dusky
outline
of
the
shore
from
the
shore
to
the
lake
and
from
the
lake
back
again
to
the
sails
our
heroine
too
began
to
commune
with
her
own
thoughts
the
excitement
of
the
late
journey
the
incidents
which
marked
the
day
of
her
arrival
at
the
fort
the
meeting
with
a
father
who
was
virtually
a
stranger
to
her
the
novelty
of
her
late
situation
in
the
garrison
and
her
present
voyage
formed
a
vista
for
the
mind
eye
to
look
back
through
which
seemed
lengthened
into
months
she
could
with
difficulty
believe
that
she
had
so
recently
left
the
town
with
all
the
usages
of
civilized
life
and
she
wondered
in
particular
that
the
incidents
which
had
occurred
during
the
descent
of
the
oswego
had
made
so
little
impression
on
her
mind
too
inexperienced
to
know
that
events
when
crowded
have
the
effect
of
time
or
that
the
quick
succession
of
novelties
that
pass
before
us
in
travelling
elevates
objects
in
a
measure
to
the
dignity
of
events
she
drew
upon
her
memory
for
days
and
dates
in
order
to
make
certain
that
she
had
known
jasper
and
the
pathfinder
and
her
own
father
but
little
more
than
a
fortnight
mabel
was
a
girl
of
heart
rather
than
of
imagination
though
by
no
means
deficient
in
the
last
and
she
could
not
easily
account
for
the
strength
of
her
feelings
in
connection
with
those
who
were
so
lately
strangers
to
her
for
she
was
not
sufficiently
accustomed
to
analyze
her
sensations
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
influences
that
have
just
been
mentioned
as
yet
however
her
pure
mind
was
free
from
the
blight
of
distrust
and
she
had
no
suspicion
of
the
views
of
either
of
her
suitors
and
one
of
the
last
thoughts
that
could
have
voluntarily
disturbed
her
confidence
would
have
been
to
suppose
it
possible
either
of
her
companions
was
a
traitor
to
his
king
and
country
america
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
was
remarkable
for
its
attachment
to
the
german
family
that
then
sat
on
the
british
throne
for
as
is
the
fact
with
all
provinces
the
virtues
and
qualities
that
are
proclaimed
near
the
centre
of
power
as
incense
and
policy
get
to
be
a
part
of
political
faith
with
the
credulous
and
ignorant
at
a
distance
this
truth
is
just
as
apparent
in
connection
with
the
prodigies
of
the
republic
as
it
then
was
in
connection
with
those
distant
rulers
whose
merits
it
was
always
safe
to
applaud
and
whose
demerits
it
was
treason
to
reveal
it
is
a
consequence
of
this
mental
dependence
that
public
opinion
is
so
much
placed
at
the
mercy
of
the
designing
and
the
world
in
the
midst
of
its
idle
boasts
of
knowledge
and
improvement
is
left
to
receive
its
truths
on
all
such
points
as
touch
the
interests
of
the
powerful
and
managing
through
such
a
medium
and
such
a
medium
only
as
may
serve
the
particular
views
of
those
who
pull
the
wires
pressed
upon
by
the
subjects
of
france
who
were
then
encircling
the
british
colonies
with
a
belt
of
forts
and
settlements
that
completely
secured
the
savages
for
allies
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
whether
the
americans
loved
the
english
more
than
they
hated
the
french
and
those
who
then
lived
probably
would
have
considered
the
alliance
which
took
place
between
the
subjects
and
the
ancient
rivals
of
the
british
crown
some
twenty
years
later
as
an
event
entirely
without
the
circle
of
probabilities
disaffection
was
a
rare
offence
and
most
of
all
would
treason
that
should
favor
france
or
frenchmen
have
been
odious
in
the
eyes
of
the
provincials
the
last
thing
that
mabel
would
suspect
of
jasper
was
the
very
crime
with
which
he
now
stood
secretly
charged
and
if
others
near
her
endured
the
pains
of
distrust
she
at
least
was
filled
with
the
generous
confidence
of
a
woman
as
yet
no
whisper
had
reached
her
ear
to
disturb
the
feeling
of
reliance
with
which
she
had
early
regarded
the
young
sailor
and
her
own
mind
would
have
been
the
last
to
suggest
such
a
thought
of
itself
the
pictures
of
the
past
and
of
the
present
therefore
that
exhibited
themselves
so
rapidly
to
her
active
imagination
were
unclouded
with
a
shade
that
might
affect
any
in
whom
she
felt
an
interest
and
ere
she
had
mused
in
the
manner
related
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
whole
scene
around
her
was
filled
with
unalloyed
satisfaction
the
season
and
the
night
to
represent
them
truly
were
of
a
nature
to
stimulate
the
sensations
which
youth
health
and
happiness
are
wont
to
associate
with
novelty
the
weather
was
warm
as
is
not
always
the
case
in
that
region
even
in
summer
while
the
air
that
came
off
the
land
in
breathing
currents
brought
with
it
the
coolness
and
fragrance
of
the
forest
the
wind
was
far
from
being
fresh
though
there
was
enough
of
it
to
drive
the
merrily
ahead
and
perhaps
to
keep
attention
alive
in
the
uncertainty
that
more
or
less
accompanies
darkness
jasper
however
appeared
to
regard
it
with
complacency
as
was
apparent
by
what
he
said
in
a
short
dialogue
that
now
occurred
between
him
and
mabel
at
this
rate
for
so
mabel
had
already
learned
to
style
the
young
sailor
said
our
heroine
we
can
not
be
long
in
reaching
our
place
of
has
your
father
then
told
you
what
that
is
mabel
he
has
told
me
nothing
my
father
is
too
much
of
a
soldier
and
too
little
used
to
have
a
family
around
him
to
talk
of
such
matters
is
it
forbidden
to
say
whither
we
are
bound
it
can
not
be
far
while
we
steer
in
this
direction
for
sixty
or
seventy
miles
will
take
us
into
the
lawrence
which
the
french
might
make
too
hot
for
us
and
no
voyage
on
this
lake
can
be
very
so
says
my
uncle
cap
but
to
me
jasper
ontario
and
the
ocean
appear
very
much
the
you
have
then
been
on
the
ocean
while
i
who
pretend
to
be
a
sailor
have
never
yet
seen
salt
water
you
must
have
a
great
contempt
for
such
a
mariner
as
myself
in
your
heart
mabel
dunham
then
i
have
no
such
thing
in
my
heart
jasper
what
right
have
i
a
girl
without
experience
or
knowledge
to
despise
any
much
less
one
like
you
who
are
trusted
by
the
major
and
who
command
a
vessel
like
this
i
have
never
been
on
the
ocean
though
i
have
seen
it
and
i
repeat
i
see
no
difference
between
this
lake
and
the
nor
in
them
that
sail
on
both
i
was
afraid
mabel
your
uncle
had
said
so
much
against
us
sailors
that
you
had
begun
to
look
upon
us
as
little
better
than
pretenders
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
on
that
account
jasper
for
i
know
my
uncle
and
he
says
as
many
things
against
those
who
live
ashore
when
at
york
as
he
now
says
against
those
who
sail
on
fresh
water
no
no
neither
my
father
nor
myself
think
anything
of
such
opinions
my
uncle
cap
if
he
spoke
openly
would
be
found
to
have
even
a
worse
notion
of
a
soldier
than
of
a
sailor
who
never
saw
the
but
your
father
mabel
has
a
better
opinion
of
soldiers
than
of
any
one
else
he
wishes
you
to
be
the
wife
of
a
soldier
jasper
i
the
wife
of
a
soldier
my
father
wishes
it
why
should
he
wish
any
such
thing
what
soldier
is
there
in
the
garrison
that
i
could
marry
that
he
could
to
marry
one
may
love
a
calling
so
well
as
to
fancy
it
will
cover
a
thousand
but
one
is
not
likely
to
love
his
own
calling
so
well
as
to
cause
him
to
overlook
everything
else
you
say
my
father
wishes
me
to
marry
a
soldier
and
yet
there
is
no
soldier
at
oswego
that
he
would
be
likely
to
give
me
to
i
am
in
an
awkward
position
for
while
i
am
not
good
enough
to
be
the
wife
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
garrison
i
think
even
you
will
admit
jasper
i
am
too
good
to
be
the
wife
of
one
of
the
common
as
mabel
spoke
thus
frankly
she
blushed
she
knew
not
why
though
the
obscurity
concealed
the
fact
from
her
companion
and
she
laughed
faintly
like
one
who
felt
that
the
subject
however
embarrassing
it
might
be
deserved
to
be
treated
fairly
jasper
it
would
seem
viewed
her
position
differently
from
herself
it
is
true
mabel
said
he
you
are
not
what
is
called
a
lady
in
the
common
meaning
of
the
not
in
any
meaning
jasper
the
generous
girl
eagerly
interrupted
on
that
head
i
have
no
vanities
i
hope
providence
has
made
me
the
daughter
of
a
sergeant
and
i
am
content
to
remain
in
the
station
in
which
i
was
but
all
do
not
remain
in
the
stations
in
which
they
were
born
mabel
for
some
rise
above
them
and
some
fall
below
them
many
sergeants
have
become
officers
even
generals
and
why
may
not
sergeants
daughters
become
officers
ladies
in
the
case
of
sergeant
dunham
daughter
i
know
no
better
reason
than
the
fact
that
no
officer
is
likely
to
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
returned
mabel
laughing
may
think
so
but
there
are
some
in
the
that
know
better
there
is
certainly
one
officer
in
that
regiment
mabel
who
does
wish
to
make
you
his
quick
as
the
flashing
lightning
the
rapid
thoughts
of
mabel
dunham
glanced
over
the
five
or
six
subalterns
of
the
corps
who
by
age
and
inclinations
would
be
the
most
likely
to
form
such
a
wish
and
we
should
do
injustice
to
her
habits
perhaps
were
we
not
to
say
that
a
lively
sensation
of
pleasure
rose
momentarily
in
her
bosom
at
the
thought
of
being
raised
above
a
station
which
whatever
might
be
her
professions
of
contentment
she
felt
that
she
had
been
too
well
educated
to
fill
with
perfect
satisfaction
but
this
emotion
was
as
transient
as
it
was
sudden
for
mabel
dunham
was
a
girl
of
too
much
pure
and
womanly
feeling
to
view
the
marriage
tie
through
anything
so
worldly
as
the
mere
advantages
of
station
the
passing
emotion
was
a
thrill
produced
by
factitious
habits
while
the
more
settled
opinion
which
remained
was
the
offspring
of
nature
and
principles
i
know
no
officer
in
the
or
any
other
regiment
who
would
be
likely
to
do
so
foolish
a
thing
nor
do
i
think
i
myself
would
do
so
foolish
a
thing
as
to
marry
an
foolish
mabel
yes
foolish
jasper
you
know
as
well
as
i
can
know
what
the
world
would
think
of
such
matters
and
i
should
be
sorry
very
sorry
to
find
that
my
husband
ever
regretted
that
he
had
so
far
yielded
to
a
fancy
for
a
face
or
a
figure
as
to
have
married
the
daughter
of
one
so
much
his
inferior
as
a
husband
mabel
will
not
be
so
likely
to
think
of
the
father
as
to
think
of
the
the
girl
was
talking
with
spirit
though
feeling
evidently
entered
into
her
part
of
the
discourse
but
she
paused
for
nearly
a
minute
after
jasper
had
made
the
last
observation
before
she
uttered
another
word
then
she
continued
in
a
manner
less
playful
and
one
critically
attentive
might
have
fancied
in
a
manner
slightly
melancholy
parent
and
child
ought
so
to
live
as
not
to
have
two
hearts
or
two
modes
of
feeling
and
thinking
a
common
interest
in
all
things
i
should
think
as
necessary
to
happiness
in
man
and
wife
as
between
the
other
members
of
the
same
family
most
of
all
ought
neither
the
man
nor
the
woman
to
have
any
unusual
cause
for
unhappiness
the
world
furnishing
so
many
of
am
i
to
understand
then
mabel
you
would
refuse
to
marry
an
officer
merely
because
he
was
an
officer
have
you
a
right
to
ask
such
a
question
jasper
said
mabel
smiling
no
other
right
than
what
a
strong
desire
to
see
you
happy
can
give
which
after
all
may
be
very
little
my
anxiety
has
been
increased
from
happening
to
know
that
it
is
your
father
intention
to
persuade
you
to
marry
lieutenant
my
dear
dear
father
can
entertain
no
notion
so
ridiculous
no
notion
so
cruel
would
it
then
be
cruel
to
wish
you
the
wife
of
a
quartermaster
i
have
told
you
what
i
think
on
that
subject
and
can
not
make
my
words
stronger
having
answered
you
so
frankly
jasper
i
have
a
right
to
ask
how
you
know
that
my
father
thinks
of
any
such
thing
that
he
has
chosen
a
husband
for
you
i
know
from
his
own
mouth
for
he
has
told
me
this
much
during
our
frequent
conversations
while
he
has
been
superintending
the
shipment
of
the
stores
and
that
muir
is
to
offer
for
you
i
know
from
the
officer
himself
who
has
told
me
as
much
by
putting
the
two
things
together
i
have
come
to
the
opinion
may
not
my
dear
father
jasper
mabel
face
glowed
like
fire
while
she
spoke
though
her
words
escaped
her
slowly
and
by
a
sort
of
involuntary
impulse
may
not
my
dear
father
have
been
thinking
of
another
it
does
not
follow
from
what
you
say
that
muir
was
in
his
is
it
not
probable
mabel
from
all
that
has
passed
what
brings
the
quartermaster
here
he
has
never
found
it
necessary
before
to
accompany
the
parties
that
have
gone
below
he
thinks
of
you
for
his
wife
and
your
father
has
made
up
his
own
mind
that
you
shall
be
so
you
must
see
mabel
that
muir
follows
mabel
made
no
answer
her
feminine
instinct
had
indeed
told
her
that
she
was
an
object
of
admiration
with
the
quartermaster
though
she
had
hardly
supposed
to
the
extent
that
jasper
believed
and
she
too
had
even
gathered
from
the
discourse
of
her
father
that
he
thought
seriously
of
having
her
disposed
of
in
marriage
but
by
no
process
of
reasoning
could
she
ever
have
arrived
at
the
inference
that
muir
was
to
be
the
man
she
did
not
believe
it
now
though
she
was
far
from
suspecting
the
truth
indeed
it
was
her
own
opinion
that
these
casual
remarks
of
her
father
which
had
struck
her
had
proceeded
from
a
general
wish
to
have
her
settled
rather
than
from
any
desire
to
see
her
united
to
any
particular
individual
these
thoughts
however
she
kept
secret
for
and
feminine
reserve
showed
her
the
impropriety
of
making
them
the
subject
of
discussion
with
her
present
companion
by
way
of
changing
the
conversation
therefore
after
the
pause
had
lasted
long
enough
to
be
embarrassing
to
both
parties
she
said
of
one
thing
you
may
be
certain
jasper
and
that
is
all
i
wish
to
say
on
the
subject
lieutenant
muir
though
he
were
a
colonel
will
never
be
the
husband
of
mabel
dunham
and
now
tell
me
of
your
voyage
when
will
it
end
that
is
uncertain
once
afloat
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
pathfinder
will
tell
you
that
he
who
begins
to
chase
the
deer
in
the
morning
can
not
tell
where
he
will
sleep
at
but
we
are
not
chasing
a
deer
nor
is
it
morning
so
pathfinder
moral
is
thrown
although
we
are
not
chasing
a
deer
we
are
after
that
which
may
be
as
hard
to
catch
i
can
tell
you
no
more
than
i
have
said
already
for
it
is
our
duty
to
be
whether
anything
depends
on
it
or
not
i
am
afraid
however
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
enough
in
the
to
show
you
what
she
can
do
at
i
think
a
woman
unwise
who
ever
marries
a
sailor
said
mabel
abruptly
and
almost
involuntarily
this
is
a
strange
opinion
why
do
you
hold
it
because
a
sailor
wife
is
certain
to
have
a
rival
in
his
vessel
my
uncle
cap
too
says
that
a
sailor
should
never
he
means
sailors
returned
jasper
laughing
if
he
thinks
wives
not
good
enough
for
those
who
sail
on
the
ocean
he
will
fancy
them
just
suited
to
those
who
sail
on
the
lakes
i
hope
mabel
you
do
not
take
your
opinions
of
us
mariners
from
all
that
master
cap
sail
ho
exclaimed
the
very
individual
of
whom
they
were
conversing
or
boat
ho
would
be
nearer
the
jasper
ran
forward
and
sure
enough
a
small
object
was
discernible
about
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
the
cutter
and
nearly
on
her
lee
bow
at
the
first
glance
he
saw
it
was
a
bark
canoe
for
though
the
darkness
prevented
hues
from
being
distinguished
the
eye
that
had
become
accustomed
to
the
night
might
discern
forms
at
some
little
distance
and
the
eye
which
like
jasper
had
long
been
familiar
with
things
aquatic
could
not
be
at
a
loss
in
discovering
the
outlines
necessary
to
come
to
the
conclusion
he
did
this
may
be
an
enemy
the
young
man
remarked
and
it
may
be
well

overhaul

by

and

he

so
near

cowper
the
meeting
with
the
indian
and
his
wife
excited
no
surprise
in
the
majority
of
those
who
witnessed
the
occurrence
but
mabel
and
all
who
knew
of
the
manner
in
which
this
chief
had
been
separated
from
the
party
of
cap
simultaneously
entertained
suspicions
which
it
was
far
easier
to
feel
than
to
follow
out
by
any
plausible
clue
to
certainty
pathfinder
who
alone
could
converse
freely
with
the
prisoners
for
such
they
might
now
be
considered
took
arrowhead
aside
and
held
a
long
conversation
with
him
concerning
the
reasons
of
the
latter
for
having
deserted
his
charge
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
since
employed
the
tuscarora
met
these
inquiries
and
he
gave
his
answers
with
the
stoicism
of
an
indian
as
respects
the
separation
his
excuses
were
very
simply
made
and
they
seemed
to
be
sufficiently
plausible
when
he
found
that
the
party
was
discovered
in
its
place
of
concealment
he
naturally
sought
his
own
safety
which
he
secured
by
plunging
into
the
woods
in
a
word
he
had
run
away
in
order
to
save
his
life
this
is
well
returned
pathfinder
affecting
to
believe
the
apologies
my
brother
did
very
wisely
but
his
woman
followed
do
not
the
women
follow
their
husbands
would
not
pathfinder
have
looked
back
to
see
if
one
he
loved
was
coming
this
appeal
was
made
to
the
guide
while
he
was
in
a
most
fortunate
frame
of
mind
to
admit
its
force
for
mabel
and
her
blandishments
and
constancy
were
becoming
images
familiar
to
his
thoughts
the
tuscarora
though
he
could
not
trace
the
reason
saw
that
his
excuse
was
admitted
and
he
stood
with
quiet
dignity
awaiting
the
next
inquiry
this
is
reasonable
and
natural
returned
pathfinder
this
is
natural
and
may
be
so
a
woman
would
be
likely
to
follow
the
man
to
whom
she
had
plighted
faith
and
husband
and
wife
are
one
flesh
your
words
are
honest
tuscarora
changing
the
language
to
the
dialect
of
the
other
your
words
are
honest
and
very
pleasant
and
just
but
why
has
my
brother
been
so
long
from
the
fort
his
friends
have
thought
of
him
often
but
have
never
seen
if
the
doe
follows
the
buck
ought
not
the
buck
to
follow
the
doe
answered
the
tuscarora
smiling
as
he
laid
a
finger
significantly
on
the
shoulder
of
his
interrogator
arrowhead
wife
followed
arrowhead
it
was
right
in
arrowhead
to
follow
his
wife
she
lost
her
way
and
they
made
her
cook
in
a
strange
i
understand
you
tuscarora
the
woman
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
mingos
and
you
kept
upon
their
pathfinder
can
see
a
reason
as
easily
as
he
can
see
the
moss
on
the
trees
it
is
and
how
long
have
you
got
the
woman
back
and
in
what
manner
has
it
been
done
two
suns
the
was
not
long
in
coming
when
her
husband
whispered
to
her
the
well
well
all
this
seems
natural
and
according
to
matrimony
but
tuscarora
how
did
you
get
that
canoe
and
why
are
you
paddling
towards
the
lawrence
instead
of
the
garrison
arrowhead
can
tell
his
own
from
that
of
another
this
canoe
is
mine
i
found
it
on
the
shore
near
the
that
sounds
reasonable
too
for
the
canoe
does
belong
to
the
man
and
an
indian
would
make
few
words
about
taking
it
still
it
is
extraordinary
that
we
saw
nothing
of
the
fellow
and
his
wife
for
the
canoe
must
have
left
the
river
before
we
did
this
idea
which
passed
rapidly
through
the
mind
of
the
guide
was
now
put
to
the
indian
in
the
shape
of
a
question
pathfinder
knows
that
a
warrior
can
have
shame
the
father
would
have
asked
me
for
his
daughter
and
i
could
not
give
her
to
him
i
sent
the
for
the
canoe
and
no
one
spoke
to
the
woman
a
tuscarora
woman
would
not
be
free
in
speaking
to
strange
all
this
too
was
plausible
and
in
conformity
with
indian
character
and
customs
as
was
usual
arrowhead
had
received
one
half
of
his
compensation
previously
to
quitting
the
mohawk
and
his
refraining
to
demand
the
residue
was
a
proof
of
that
conscientious
consideration
of
mutual
rights
that
quite
as
often
distinguishes
the
morality
of
a
savage
as
that
of
a
christian
to
one
as
upright
as
pathfinder
arrowhead
had
conducted
himself
with
delicacy
and
propriety
though
it
would
have
been
more
in
accordance
with
his
own
frank
nature
to
have
met
the
father
and
abided
by
the
simple
truth
still
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
indians
he
saw
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
track
of
things
in
the
course
the
other
had
taken
this
runs
like
water
flowing
down
hill
arrowhead
he
answered
after
a
little
reflection
and
truth
obliges
me
to
own
it
it
was
the
gift
of
a
to
act
in
this
way
though
i
do
not
think
it
was
the
gift
of
a
you
would
not
look
upon
the
grief
of
the
girl
father
arrowhead
made
a
quiet
inclination
of
the
body
as
if
to
assent
one
thing
more
my
brother
will
tell
me
continued
pathfinder
and
there
will
be
no
cloud
between
his
wigwam
and
the
of
the
yengeese
if
he
can
blow
away
this
bit
of
fog
with
his
breath
his
friends
will
look
at
him
as
he
sits
by
his
own
fire
and
he
can
look
at
them
as
they
lay
aside
their
arms
and
forget
that
they
are
warriors
why
was
the
head
of
arrowhead
canoe
looking
towards
the
lawrence
where
there
are
none
but
enemies
to
be
found
why
were
the
pathfinder
and
his
friends
looking
the
same
way
asked
the
tuscarora
calmly
a
tuscarora
may
look
in
the
same
direction
as
a
why
to
own
the
truth
arrowhead
we
are
out
scouting
like
that
is
sailing
in
other
words
we
are
on
the
king
business
and
we
have
a
right
to
be
here
though
we
may
not
have
a
right
to
say
we
are
arrowhead
saw
the
big
canoe
and
he
loves
to
look
on
the
face
of
he
was
going
towards
the
sun
at
evening
in
order
to
seek
his
wigwam
but
finding
that
the
young
sailor
was
going
the
other
way
he
turned
that
he
might
look
in
the
same
direction
and
arrowhead
were
together
on
the
last
this
may
all
be
true
tuscarora
and
you
are
welcome
you
shall
eat
of
our
venison
and
then
we
must
separate
the
setting
sun
is
behind
us
and
both
of
us
move
quick
my
brother
will
get
too
far
from
that
which
he
seeks
unless
he
turns
pathfinder
now
returned
to
the
others
and
repeated
the
result
of
his
examination
he
appeared
himself
to
believe
that
the
account
of
arrowhead
might
be
true
though
he
admitted
that
caution
would
be
prudent
with
one
he
disliked
but
his
auditors
jasper
excepted
seemed
less
disposed
to
put
faith
in
the
explanations
this
chap
must
be
ironed
at
once
brother
dunham
said
cap
as
soon
as
pathfinder
finished
his
narration
he
must
be
turned
over
to
the
if
there
is
any
such
officer
on
fresh
water
and
a
ought
to
be
ordered
as
soon
as
we
reach
i
think
it
wisest
to
detain
the
fellow
the
sergeant
answered
but
irons
are
unnecessary
so
long
as
he
remains
in
the
cutter
in
the
morning
the
matter
shall
be
inquired
arrowhead
was
now
summoned
and
told
the
decision
the
indian
listened
gravely
and
made
no
objections
on
the
contrary
he
submitted
with
the
calm
and
reserved
dignity
with
which
the
american
aborigines
are
known
to
yield
to
fate
and
he
stood
apart
an
attentive
but
calm
observer
of
what
was
passing
jasper
caused
the
cutter
sails
to
be
filled
and
the
resumed
her
course
it
was
now
getting
near
the
hour
to
set
the
watch
and
when
it
was
usual
to
retire
for
the
night
most
of
the
party
went
below
leaving
no
one
on
deck
but
cap
the
sergeant
jasper
and
two
of
the
crew
arrowhead
and
his
wife
also
remained
the
former
standing
aloof
in
proud
reserve
and
the
latter
exhibiting
by
her
attitude
and
passiveness
the
meek
humility
that
characterizes
an
indian
woman
you
will
find
a
place
for
your
wife
below
arrowhead
where
my
daughter
will
attend
to
her
wants
said
the
sergeant
kindly
who
was
himself
on
the
point
of
quitting
the
deck
yonder
is
a
sail
where
you
may
sleep
i
thank
my
father
the
tuscaroras
are
not
poor
the
woman
will
look
for
my
blankets
in
the
as
you
wish
my
friend
we
think
it
necessary
to
detain
you
but
not
necessary
to
confine
or
to
maltreat
you
send
your
squaw
into
the
canoe
for
the
blankets
and
you
may
follow
her
yourself
and
hand
us
up
the
paddles
as
there
may
be
some
sleepy
heads
in
the
added
the
sergeant
in
a
lower
tone
it
may
be
well
to
secure
the
jasper
assented
and
arrowhead
and
his
wife
with
whom
resistance
appeared
to
be
out
of
the
question
silently
complied
with
the
directions
a
few
expressions
of
sharp
rebuke
passed
from
the
indian
to
his
wife
while
both
were
employed
in
the
canoe
which
the
latter
received
with
submissive
quiet
immediately
repairing
an
error
she
had
made
by
laying
aside
the
blanket
she
had
taken
and
searching
for
another
that
was
more
to
her
tyrant
mind
come
bear
a
hand
arrowhead
said
the
sergeant
who
stood
on
the
gunwale
overlooking
the
movements
of
the
two
which
were
proceeding
too
slowly
for
the
impatience
of
a
drowsy
man
it
is
getting
late
and
we
soldiers
have
such
a
thing
as
reveille
early
to
bed
and
early
to
arrowhead
is
coming
was
the
answer
as
the
tuscarora
stepped
towards
the
head
of
his
canoe
one
blow
of
his
keen
knife
severed
the
rope
which
held
the
boat
and
then
the
cutter
glanced
ahead
leaving
the
light
bubble
of
bark
which
instantly
lost
its
way
almost
stationary
so
suddenly
and
dexterously
was
this
manoeuvre
performed
that
the
canoe
was
on
the
lee
quarter
of
the
before
the
sergeant
was
aware
of
the
artifice
and
quite
in
her
wake
ere
he
had
time
to
announce
it
to
his
companions
shouted
jasper
letting
fly
the
with
his
own
hands
when
the
cutter
came
swiftly
up
to
the
breeze
with
all
her
canvas
flapping
or
was
running
into
the
wind
eye
as
seamen
term
it
until
the
light
craft
was
a
hundred
feet
to
windward
of
her
former
position
quick
and
dexterous
as
was
this
movement
and
ready
as
had
been
the
expedient
it
was
not
quicker
or
more
ready
than
that
of
the
tuscarora
with
an
intelligence
that
denoted
some
familiarity
with
vessels
he
had
seized
his
paddle
and
was
already
skimming
the
water
aided
by
the
efforts
of
his
wife
the
direction
he
took
was
or
on
a
line
that
led
him
equally
towards
the
wind
and
the
shore
while
it
also
kept
him
so
far
aloof
from
the
cutter
as
to
avoid
the
danger
of
the
latter
falling
on
board
of
him
when
she
filled
on
the
other
tack
swiftly
as
the
had
shot
into
the
wind
and
far
as
she
had
forced
ahead
jasper
knew
it
was
necessary
to
cast
her
ere
she
had
lost
all
her
way
and
it
was
not
two
minutes
from
the
time
the
helm
had
been
put
down
before
the
lively
little
craft
was
aback
forward
and
rapidly
falling
off
in
order
to
allow
her
sails
to
fill
on
the
opposite
tack
he
will
escape
said
jasper
the
instant
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
relative
bearings
of
the
cutter
and
the
canoe
the
cunning
knave
is
paddling
dead
to
windward
and
the
can
never
overtake
him
you
have
a
canoe
exclaimed
the
sergeant
manifesting
the
eagerness
of
a
boy
to
join
in
the
pursuit
let
us
launch
it
and
give
chase
it
will
be
useless
if
pathfinder
had
been
on
deck
there
might
have
been
a
chance
but
there
is
none
now
to
launch
the
canoe
would
have
taken
three
or
four
minutes
and
the
time
lost
would
be
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
both
cap
and
the
sergeant
saw
the
truth
of
this
which
would
have
been
nearly
even
to
one
unaccustomed
to
vessels
the
shore
was
distant
less
than
half
a
mile
and
the
canoe
was
already
glancing
into
its
shadows
at
a
rate
to
show
that
it
would
reach
the
land
before
its
pursuers
could
probably
get
half
the
distance
the
helm
of
the
was
reluctantly
put
up
again
and
the
cutter
wore
short
round
on
her
heel
coming
up
to
her
course
on
the
other
tack
as
if
acting
on
an
instinct
all
this
was
done
by
jasper
in
profound
silence
his
assistants
understanding
what
was
necessary
and
lending
their
aid
in
a
sort
of
mechanical
imitation
while
these
manoeuvres
were
in
the
course
of
execution
cap
took
the
sergeant
by
a
button
and
led
him
towards
the
where
he
was
out
of
and
began
to
unlock
his
stores
of
thought
brother
dunham
said
he
with
an
ominous
face
this
is
a
matter
that
requires
mature
thought
and
much
the
life
of
a
soldier
brother
cap
is
one
of
constant
thought
and
circumspection
on
this
frontier
were
we
to
overlook
either
our
scalps
might
be
taken
from
our
heads
in
the
first
but
i
consider
this
capture
of
arrowhead
as
a
circumstance
and
i
might
add
his
escape
as
another
this
jasper
freshwater
must
look
to
they
are
both
circumstances
truly
brother
but
they
tell
different
ways
if
it
is
a
circumstance
against
the
lad
that
the
indian
has
escaped
it
is
a
circumstance
in
his
favor
that
he
was
first
ay
ay
but
two
circumstances
do
not
contradict
each
other
like
two
negatives
if
you
will
follow
the
advice
of
an
old
seaman
sergeant
not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
in
taking
the
steps
necessary
for
the
security
of
the
vessel
and
all
on
board
of
her
the
cutter
is
now
slipping
through
the
water
at
the
rate
of
six
knots
and
as
the
distances
are
so
short
on
this
bit
of
a
pond
we
may
all
find
ourselves
in
a
french
port
before
morning
and
in
a
french
prison
before
this
may
be
true
enough
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
brother
in
my
opinion
you
should
put
this
master
freshwater
under
arrest
on
the
spot
send
him
below
under
the
charge
of
a
sentinel
and
transfer
the
command
of
the
cutter
to
me
all
this
you
have
power
to
perform
the
craft
belonging
to
the
army
and
you
being
the
commanding
officer
of
the
troops
sergeant
dunham
deliberated
more
than
an
hour
on
the
propriety
of
this
proposal
for
though
sufficiently
prompt
when
his
mind
was
really
made
up
he
was
habitually
thoughtful
and
wary
the
habit
of
superintending
the
personal
police
of
the
garrison
had
made
him
acquainted
with
character
and
he
had
long
been
disposed
to
think
well
of
jasper
still
that
subtle
poison
suspicion
had
entered
his
soul
and
so
much
were
the
artifices
and
intrigues
of
the
french
dreaded
that
especially
warned
as
he
had
been
by
his
commander
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
the
recollection
of
years
of
good
conduct
should
vanish
under
the
influence
of
a
distrust
so
keen
and
seemingly
so
plausible
in
this
embarrassment
the
sergeant
consulted
the
quartermaster
whose
opinion
as
his
superior
he
felt
bound
to
respect
though
at
the
moment
independent
of
his
control
it
is
an
unfortunate
occurrence
for
one
who
is
in
a
dilemma
to
ask
advice
of
another
who
is
desirous
of
standing
well
in
his
favor
the
party
consulted
being
almost
certain
to
try
to
think
in
the
manner
which
will
be
the
most
agreeable
to
the
party
consulting
in
the
present
instance
it
was
equally
unfortunate
as
respects
a
candid
consideration
of
the
subject
that
cap
instead
of
the
sergeant
himself
made
the
statement
of
the
case
for
the
earnest
old
sailor
was
not
backward
in
letting
his
listener
perceive
to
which
side
he
was
desirous
that
the
quartermaster
should
lean
lieutenant
muir
was
much
too
politic
to
offend
the
uncle
and
father
of
the
woman
he
hoped
and
expected
to
win
had
he
really
thought
the
case
admitted
of
doubt
but
in
the
manner
in
which
the
facts
were
submitted
to
him
he
was
seriously
inclined
to
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
put
the
control
of
the
temporarily
into
the
management
of
cap
as
a
precaution
against
treachery
this
opinion
then
decided
the
sergeant
who
forthwith
set
about
the
execution
of
the
necessary
measures
without
entering
into
any
explanations
sergeant
dunham
simply
informed
jasper
that
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
deprive
him
temporarily
of
the
command
of
the
cutter
and
to
confer
it
on
his
own
a
natural
and
involuntary
burst
of
surprise
which
escaped
the
young
man
was
met
by
a
quiet
remark
reminding
him
that
military
service
was
often
of
a
nature
that
required
concealment
and
a
declaration
that
the
present
duty
was
of
such
a
character
that
this
particular
arrangement
had
become
indispensable
although
jasper
astonishment
remained
undiminished
the
sergeant
cautiously
abstaining
from
making
any
allusion
to
his
suspicions
the
young
man
was
accustomed
to
obey
with
military
submission
and
he
quietly
acquiesced
with
his
own
mouth
directing
the
little
crew
to
receive
their
further
orders
from
cap
until
another
change
should
be
effected
when
however
he
was
told
the
case
required
that
not
only
he
himself
but
his
principal
assistant
who
on
account
of
his
long
acquaintance
with
the
lake
was
usually
termed
the
pilot
were
to
remain
below
there
was
an
alteration
in
his
countenance
and
manner
that
denoted
strong
feeling
though
it
was
so
well
mastered
as
to
leave
even
the
distrustful
cap
in
doubt
as
to
its
meaning
as
a
matter
of
course
however
when
distrust
exists
it
was
not
long
before
the
worst
construction
was
put
upon
it
as
soon
as
jasper
and
the
pilot
were
below
the
sentinel
at
the
hatch
received
private
orders
to
pay
particular
attention
to
both
to
allow
neither
to
come
on
deck
again
without
giving
instant
notice
to
the
person
who
might
then
be
in
charge
of
the
cutter
and
to
insist
on
his
return
below
as
soon
as
possible
this
precaution
however
was
uncalled
for
jasper
and
his
assistant
both
throwing
themselves
silently
on
their
pallets
which
neither
quitted
again
that
night
and
now
sergeant
said
cap
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
master
of
the
deck
you
will
just
have
the
goodness
to
give
me
the
courses
and
distance
that
i
may
see
the
boat
keeps
her
head
the
right
i
know
nothing
of
either
brother
cap
returned
dunham
not
a
little
embarrassed
at
the
question
we
must
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
station
among
the
thousand
islands
we
shall
land
relieve
the
party
that
is
already
out
and
get
information
for
our
future
government
that
it
nearly
word
for
word
as
it
stands
in
the
written
but
you
can
muster
a
chart
something
in
the
way
of
bearings
and
distances
that
i
may
see
the
road
i
do
not
think
jasper
ever
had
anything
of
the
sort
to
go
no
chart
sergeant
dunham
not
a
scrap
of
a
pen
even
our
sailors
navigate
this
lake
without
any
aid
from
the
devil
they
do
they
must
be
regular
yahoos
and
do
you
suppose
sergeant
dunham
that
i
can
find
one
island
out
of
a
thousand
without
knowing
its
name
or
its
position
without
even
a
course
or
a
distance
as
for
the
brother
cap
you
need
not
be
particular
for
not
one
of
the
whole
thousand
a
name
and
so
a
mistake
can
never
be
made
on
that
score
as
for
the
position
never
having
been
there
myself
i
can
tell
you
nothing
about
it
nor
do
i
think
its
position
of
any
particular
consequence
provided
we
find
the
spot
perhaps
one
of
the
hands
on
deck
can
tell
us
the
hold
on
sergeant
hold
on
a
moment
if
you
please
sergeant
dunham
if
i
am
to
command
this
craft
it
must
be
done
if
you
please
without
holding
any
councils
of
war
with
the
cook
and
a
is
a
and
he
must
have
an
opinion
of
his
own
even
if
it
be
a
wrong
one
i
suppose
you
know
service
well
enough
to
understand
that
it
is
better
in
a
commander
to
go
wrong
than
to
go
nowhere
at
all
events
the
lord
high
admiral
could
command
a
yawl
with
dignity
if
he
consulted
the
cockswain
every
time
he
wished
to
go
ashore
no
sir
if
i
sink
i
sink
but
d
i
go
down
and
with
but
brother
cap
i
have
no
wish
to
go
down
anywhere
unless
it
be
to
the
station
among
the
thousand
islands
whither
we
are
well
well
sergeant
rather
than
ask
advice
that
is
direct
barefaced
advice
of
a
foremast
hand
or
any
other
than
a
officer
i
would
go
round
to
the
whole
thousand
and
examine
them
one
by
one
until
we
got
the
right
haven
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
coming
at
an
opinion
without
manifesting
ignorance
and
i
will
manage
to
rouse
all
there
is
out
of
these
hands
and
make
them
think
all
the
while
that
i
am
cramming
them
with
my
own
experience
we
are
sometimes
obliged
to
use
the
glass
at
sea
when
there
is
nothing
in
sight
or
to
heave
the
lead
long
before
we
strike
soundings
when
a
youngster
sailed
two
with
a
man
who
navigated
his
ship
pretty
much
by
the
latter
sort
of
information
which
sometimes
i
know
we
are
steering
in
the
right
direction
at
present
returned
the
sergeant
but
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
we
shall
be
up
with
a
headland
where
we
must
feel
our
way
with
more
leave
me
to
pump
the
man
at
the
wheel
brother
and
you
shall
see
that
i
will
make
him
suck
in
a
very
few
cap
and
the
sergeant
now
walked
aft
until
they
stood
by
the
sailor
who
was
at
the
helm
cap
maintaining
an
air
of
security
and
tranquillity
like
one
who
was
entirely
confident
of
his
own
powers
this
is
a
wholesome
air
my
lad
cap
observed
in
the
manner
that
a
superior
on
board
a
vessel
sometimes
condescends
to
use
to
a
favored
inferior
of
course
you
have
it
in
this
fashion
off
the
land
every
night
at
this
season
of
the
year
sir
the
man
returned
touching
his
hat
out
of
respect
to
his
new
commander
and
sergeant
dunham
connection
the
same
thing
i
take
it
among
the
thousand
islands
the
wind
will
stand
of
course
though
we
shall
then
have
land
on
every
side
of
when
we
get
farther
east
sir
the
wind
will
probably
shift
for
there
can
then
be
no
particular
ay
ay
so
much
for
your
fresh
water
it
has
always
some
trick
that
is
opposed
to
nature
now
down
among
the
west
india
islands
one
is
just
as
certain
of
having
a
as
he
is
of
having
a
in
that
respect
there
is
no
difference
though
it
quite
in
rule
it
should
be
different
up
here
on
this
bit
of
fresh
water
of
course
my
lad
you
know
all
about
these
said
thousand
islands
lord
bless
you
master
cap
nobody
knows
all
about
them
or
anything
about
them
they
are
a
puzzle
to
the
oldest
sailor
on
the
lake
and
we
do
pretend
to
know
even
their
names
for
that
matter
most
of
them
have
no
more
names
than
a
child
that
dies
before
it
is
are
you
a
roman
catholic
demanded
the
sergeant
sharply
no
sir
nor
anything
else
i
a
generalizer
about
religion
never
troubling
that
which
do
trouble
hum
a
generalizer
that
is
no
doubt
one
of
the
new
sects
that
afflict
the
country
muttered
dunham
whose
grandfather
had
been
a
new
jersey
quaker
his
father
a
presbyterian
and
who
had
joined
the
church
of
england
himself
after
he
entered
the
army
i
take
it
john
resumed
cap
your
name
is
jack
i
believe
no
sir
i
am
called
ay
robert
it
very
much
the
same
thing
jack
or
bob
we
use
the
two
indifferently
i
say
bob
it
good
holding
ground
is
it
down
at
this
same
station
for
which
we
are
bound
bless
you
sir
i
know
no
more
about
it
than
one
of
the
mohawks
or
a
soldier
of
the
did
you
never
anchor
there
never
sir
master
always
makes
fast
to
the
but
in
running
in
for
the
town
you
kept
the
lead
going
out
of
question
and
must
have
tallowed
as
tallow
and
town
too
bless
your
heart
master
cap
there
is
no
more
town
than
there
is
on
your
chin
and
not
half
as
much
tallow
the
sergeant
smiled
grimly
but
his
did
not
detect
this
proof
of
humor
no
church
tower
nor
light
nor
fort
ha
there
is
a
garrison
as
you
call
it
hereaway
at
least
ask
sergeant
dunham
sir
if
you
wish
to
know
that
all
the
garrison
is
on
board
the
but
in
running
in
bob
which
of
the
channels
do
you
think
the
best
the
one
you
went
last
or
or
or
ay
or
the
other
i
ca
say
sir
i
know
nothing
of
you
did
go
to
sleep
fellow
at
the
wheel
did
you
not
at
the
wheel
sir
but
down
in
the
in
my
berth
sent
us
below
soldiers
and
all
with
the
exception
of
the
pilot
and
we
know
no
more
of
the
road
than
if
we
had
never
been
over
it
this
he
has
always
done
in
going
in
and
coming
out
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
tell
you
nothing
of
the
channel
or
the
course
after
we
are
once
fairly
up
with
the
islands
no
one
knows
anything
of
either
but
jasper
and
the
here
is
a
circumstance
for
you
sergeant
said
cap
leading
his
a
little
aside
there
is
no
one
on
board
to
pump
for
they
all
suck
from
ignorance
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
brake
how
the
devil
am
i
to
find
the
way
to
this
station
for
which
we
are
bound
sure
enough
brother
cap
your
question
is
more
easily
put
than
answered
is
there
no
such
thing
as
figuring
it
out
by
navigation
i
thought
you
mariners
were
able
to
do
as
small
a
thing
as
that
i
have
often
read
of
their
discovering
islands
that
you
have
brother
that
you
have
and
this
discovery
would
be
the
greatest
of
them
all
for
it
would
not
only
be
discovering
one
island
but
one
island
out
of
a
still
the
sailors
of
the
lake
have
a
method
of
finding
the
places
they
wish
to
go
if
i
have
understood
you
sergeant
this
station
or
blockhouse
is
particularly
it
is
indeed
the
utmost
care
having
been
taken
to
prevent
a
knowledge
of
its
position
from
reaching
the
and
you
expect
me
a
stranger
on
your
lake
to
find
this
place
without
chart
course
distance
latitude
longitude
or
soundings
ay
d
or
tallow
allow
me
to
ask
if
you
think
a
mariner
runs
by
his
nose
like
one
of
pathfinder
hounds
well
brother
you
may
yet
learn
something
by
questioning
the
young
man
at
the
helm
i
can
hardly
think
that
he
is
as
ignorant
as
he
pretends
to
hum
this
looks
like
another
circumstance
for
that
matter
the
case
is
getting
to
be
so
full
of
circumstances
that
one
hardly
knows
how
to
foot
up
the
evidence
but
we
will
soon
see
how
much
the
lad
cap
and
the
sergeant
now
returned
to
their
station
near
the
helm
and
the
former
renewed
his
inquiries
do
you
happen
to
know
what
may
be
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
this
said
island
my
lad
he
asked
the
what
sir
why
the
latitude
or
longitude
one
or
both
i
not
particular
which
as
i
merely
inquire
in
order
to
see
how
they
bring
up
young
men
on
this
bit
of
fresh
i
not
particular
about
either
myself
sir
and
so
i
do
not
happen
to
know
what
you
not
what
i
mean
you
know
what
latitude
is
not
i
sir
returned
the
man
hesitating
though
i
believe
it
is
french
for
the
upper
whistled
cap
drawing
out
his
breath
like
the
broken
stop
of
an
organ
latitude
french
for
upper
lakes
young
man
do
you
know
what
longitude
means
i
believe
i
do
sir
that
is
five
feet
six
the
regulation
height
for
soldiers
in
the
king
there
the
longitude
found
out
for
you
sergeant
in
the
rattling
of
a
you
have
some
notion
about
a
degree
and
minutes
and
seconds
i
hope
yes
sir
degree
means
my
betters
and
minutes
and
seconds
are
for
the
short
or
long
we
all
know
these
things
as
well
as
the
d
brother
dunham
if
i
think
even
faith
can
get
along
on
this
lake
much
as
they
say
it
can
do
with
mountains
well
my
lad
you
understand
the
azimuth
and
measuring
distances
and
how
to
box
the
as
for
the
first
sir
i
ca
say
i
do
the
distances
we
all
know
as
we
measure
them
from
point
to
point
and
as
for
boxing
the
compass
i
will
turn
my
back
to
no
admiral
in
his
majesty
fleet
nothe
nothe
and
by
east
nothe
and
by
nothe
and
by
east
east
and
by
that
will
do
that
will
do
you
bring
about
a
shift
of
wind
if
you
go
on
in
this
manner
i
see
very
plainly
sergeant
walking
away
again
and
dropping
his
voice
we
nothing
to
hope
for
from
that
chap
stand
on
two
hours
longer
on
this
tack
when
we
and
get
the
soundings
after
which
we
will
be
governed
by
to
this
the
sergeant
made
no
objections
and
as
the
wind
grew
lighter
as
usual
with
the
advance
of
night
and
there
were
no
immediate
obstacles
to
the
navigation
he
made
a
bed
of
a
sail
on
deck
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
sound
sleep
of
a
soldier
cap
continued
to
walk
the
deck
for
he
was
one
whose
iron
frame
set
fatigue
at
defiance
and
not
once
that
night
did
he
close
his
eyes
it
was
broad
daylight
when
sergeant
dunham
awoke
and
the
exclamation
of
surprise
that
escaped
him
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
began
to
look
about
him
was
stronger
than
it
was
usual
for
one
so
drilled
to
suffer
to
be
heard
he
found
the
weather
entirely
changed
the
view
bounded
by
driving
mist
that
limited
the
visible
horizon
to
a
circle
of
about
a
mile
in
diameter
the
lake
raging
and
covered
with
foam
and
the
a
brief
conversation
with
his
let
him
into
the
secrets
of
all
these
sudden
changes
according
to
the
account
of
master
cap
the
wind
had
died
away
to
a
calm
about
midnight
or
just
as
he
was
thinking
of
to
sound
for
islands
ahead
were
beginning
to
be
seen
at
one
it
began
to
blow
from
the
accompanied
by
a
drizzle
and
he
stood
off
to
the
northward
and
westward
knowing
that
the
coast
of
new
york
lay
in
the
opposite
direction
at
one
he
stowed
the
reefed
the
mainsail
and
took
the
bonnet
off
the
jib
at
two
he
was
compelled
to
get
a
second
reef
aft
and
by
two
he
had
put
a
in
the
sail
and
was
i
ca
say
but
the
boat
behaves
well
sergeant
the
old
sailor
added
but
it
blows
pounders
i
had
no
idea
there
were
any
such
currents
of
air
up
here
on
this
bit
of
fresh
water
though
i
care
not
the
knotting
of
a
yarn
for
it
as
your
lake
has
now
somewhat
of
a
natural
look
and
if
this
d
d
water
had
a
savor
of
salt
about
it
one
might
be
how
long
have
you
been
heading
in
this
direction
brother
cap
inquired
the
prudent
soldier
and
at
what
rate
may
we
be
going
through
the
water
why
two
or
three
hours
mayhap
and
she
went
like
a
horse
for
the
first
pair
of
them
oh
we
a
fine
offing
now
for
to
own
the
truth
little
relishing
the
neighborhood
of
them
said
islands
although
they
are
to
windward
i
took
the
helm
myself
and
run
her
off
free
for
some
league
or
two
we
are
well
to
leeward
of
them
i
engage
i
say
to
leeward
for
though
one
might
wish
to
be
well
to
windward
of
one
island
or
even
half
a
dozen
when
it
comes
to
a
thousand
the
better
way
is
to
give
it
up
at
once
and
to
slide
down
under
their
lee
as
fast
as
possible
no
no
there
they
are
up
yonder
in
the
dingle
and
there
they
may
stay
for
anything
charles
cap
as
the
north
shore
lies
only
some
five
or
six
leagues
from
us
brother
and
i
know
there
is
a
large
bay
in
that
quarter
might
it
not
be
well
to
consult
some
of
the
crew
concerning
our
position
if
indeed
we
do
not
call
up
jasper
and
tell
him
to
carry
us
back
to
oswego
for
it
is
quite
impossible
we
should
ever
reach
the
station
with
this
wind
directly
in
our
there
are
several
serious
professional
reasons
sergeant
against
all
your
propositions
in
the
first
place
an
admission
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
a
commander
would
destroy
discipline
no
matter
brother
i
understand
your
shake
of
the
head
but
nothing
capsizes
discipline
so
much
as
to
confess
ignorance
i
once
knew
a
master
of
a
vessel
who
went
a
week
on
a
wrong
course
rather
than
allow
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
it
was
surprising
how
much
he
rose
in
the
opinions
of
his
people
just
because
they
could
not
understand
that
may
do
on
salt
water
brother
cap
but
it
will
hardly
do
on
fresh
rather
than
wreck
my
command
on
the
canada
shore
i
shall
feel
it
a
duty
to
take
jasper
out
of
and
make
a
haven
in
frontenac
no
sergeant
the
is
in
good
hands
and
will
now
learn
something
of
seamanship
we
have
a
fine
offing
and
no
one
but
a
madman
would
think
of
going
upon
a
coast
in
a
gale
like
this
i
shall
ware
every
watch
and
then
we
shall
be
safe
against
all
dangers
but
those
of
the
drift
which
in
a
light
low
craft
like
this
without
will
be
next
to
nothing
leave
it
all
to
me
sergeant
and
i
pledge
you
the
character
of
charles
cap
that
all
will
go
sergeant
dunham
was
fain
to
yield
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
connection
professional
skill
and
hoped
that
he
would
take
such
care
of
the
cutter
as
would
amply
justify
his
opinion
of
him
on
the
other
hand
as
distrust
like
care
grows
by
what
it
feeds
on
he
entertained
so
much
apprehension
of
treachery
that
he
was
quite
willing
any
one
but
jasper
should
just
then
have
the
control
of
the
fate
of
the
whole
party
truth
moreover
compels
us
to
admit
another
motive
the
particular
duty
on
which
he
was
now
sent
of
right
should
have
been
confided
to
a
commissioned
officer
and
major
duncan
had
excited
a
good
deal
of
discontent
among
the
subalterns
of
the
garrison
by
having
confided
it
to
one
of
the
sergeant
humble
station
to
return
without
having
even
reached
the
point
of
destination
therefore
the
latter
felt
would
be
a
failure
from
which
he
was
not
likely
soon
to
recover
and
the
measure
would
at
once
be
the
means
of
placing
a
superior

his
shoes

and
the
quartermaster
to
retreat
also
cap
wore
several
times
and
it
was
now
evident
that
the
was
drifting
into
the
broader
and
deeper
parts
of
the
lake
the
seas
raging
down
upon
her
in
a
way
that
none
but
a
vessel
of
superior
mould
and
build
could
have
long
ridden
and
withstood
all
this
however
gave
cap
no
uneasiness
but
like
the
hunter
that
pricks
his
ears
at
the
sound
of
the
horn
or
the
that
paws
and
snorts
with
pleasure
at
the
roll
of
the
drum
the
whole
scene
awakened
all
that
was
man
within
him
and
instead
of
the
captious
supercilious
and
dogmatic
critic
quarrelling
with
trifles
and
exaggerating
immaterial
things
he
began
to
exhibit
the
qualities
of
the
hardy
and
experienced
seaman
which
he
truly
was
the
hands
soon
imbibed
a
respect
for
his
skill
and
though
they
wondered
at
the
disappearance
of
their
old
commander
and
the
pilot
for
which
no
reason
had
been
publicly
given
they
soon
yielded
an
implicit
and
cheerful
obedience
to
the
new
one
this
bit
of
fresh
water
after
all
brother
dunham
has
some
spirit
i
find
cried
cap
about
noon
rubbing
his
hands
in
pure
satisfaction
at
finding
himself
once
more
wrestling
with
the
elements
the
wind
seems
to
be
an
honest
gale
and
the
seas
have
a
fanciful
resemblance
to
those
of
the
gulf
stream
i
like
this
sergeant
i
like
this
and
shall
get
to
respect
your
lake
if
it
hold
out
hours
longer
in
the
fashion
in
which
it
has
land
ho
shouted
the
man
who
was
stationed
on
the
forecastle
cap
hurried
forward
and
there
sure
enough
the
land
was
visible
through
the
drizzle
at
the
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
the
cutter
heading
directly
towards
it
the
first
impulse
of
the
old
seaman
was
to
give
an
order
to
stand
by
to
ware
off
shore
but
the
soldier
restrained
him
by
going
a
little
nearer
said
the
sergeant
some
of
us
may
recognize
the
place
most
of
us
know
the
american
shore
in
this
part
of
the
lake
and
it
will
be
something
gained
to
learn
our
very
true
very
true
if
indeed
there
is
any
chance
of
that
we
will
hold
on
what
is
this
off
here
a
little
on
our
it
looks
like
a
low
the
garrison
by
jove
exclaimed
the
other
whose
trained
eye
sooner
recognized
the
military
outlines
than
the
less
instructed
senses
of
his
connection
the
sergeant
was
not
mistaken
there
was
the
fort
sure
enough
though
it
looked
dim
and
indistinct
through
the
fine
rain
as
if
it
were
seen
in
the
dusk
of
evening
or
the
haze
of
morning
the
low
sodded
and
verdant
ramparts
the
sombre
palisades
now
darker
than
ever
with
water
the
roof
of
a
house
or
two
the
tall
solitary
flagstaff
with
its
halyards
blown
steadily
out
into
a
curve
that
appeared
traced
in
immovable
lines
in
the
air
were
all
soon
to
be
seen
though
no
sign
of
animated
life
could
be
discovered
even
the
sentinel
was
housed
and
at
first
it
was
believed
that
no
eye
would
detect
the
presence
of
their
own
vessel
but
the
unceasing
vigilance
of
a
border
garrison
did
not
slumber
one
of
the
probably
made
the
interesting
discovery
a
man
or
two
were
seen
on
some
elevated
stands
and
then
the
entire
ramparts
next
the
lake
were
dotted
with
human
beings
the
whole
scene
was
one
in
which
sublimity
was
singularly
relieved
by
the
picturesque
the
raging
of
the
tempest
had
a
character
of
duration
that
rendered
it
easy
to
imagine
it
might
be
a
permanent
feature
of
the
spot
the
roar
of
the
wind
was
without
intermission
and
the
raging
water
answered
to
its
dull
but
grand
strains
with
hissing
spray
a
menacing
wash
and
sullen
surges
the
drizzle
made
a
medium
for
the
eye
which
closely
resembled
that
of
a
thin
mist
softening
and
rendering
mysterious
the
images
it
revealed
while
the
genial
feeling
that
is
apt
to
accompany
a
gale
of
wind
on
water
contributed
to
aid
the
milder
influences
of
the
moment
the
dark
interminable
forest
hove
up
out
of
the
obscurity
grand
sombre
and
impressive
while
the
solitary
peculiar
and
picturesque
glimpses
of
life
that
were
caught
in
and
about
the
fort
formed
a
refuge
for
the
eye
to
retreat
to
when
oppressed
with
the
more
imposing
objects
of
nature
they
see
us
said
the
sergeant
and
think
we
have
returned
on
account
of
the
gale
and
have
fallen
to
leeward
of
the
port
yes
there
is
major
duncan
himself
on
the
bastion
i
know
him
by
his
height
and
by
the
officers
around
sergeant
it
would
be
worth
standing
a
little
jeering
if
we
could
fetch
into
the
river
and
come
safely
to
an
anchor
in
that
case
too
we
might
land
this
master
and
purify
the
it
would
indeed
but
as
poor
a
sailor
as
i
am
i
well
know
it
can
not
be
done
nothing
that
sails
the
lake
can
turn
to
windward
against
this
gale
and
there
is
no
anchorage
outside
in
weather
like
i
know
it
i
see
it
sergeant
and
pleasant
as
is
that
sight
to
you
landsmen
we
must
leave
it
for
myself
i
am
never
so
happy
in
heavy
weather
as
when
i
am
certain
that
the
land
is
behind
the
had
now
forged
so
near
in
that
it
became
indispensable
to
lay
her
head
off
shore
again
and
the
necessary
orders
were
given
the
was
set
forward
the
gaff
lowered
the
helm
put
up
and
the
light
craft
that
seemed
to
sport
with
the
elements
like
a
duck
fell
off
a
little
drew
ahead
swiftly
obeyed
her
rudder
and
was
soon
flying
away
on
the
top
of
the
surges
dead
before
the
gale
while
making
this
rapid
flight
though
the
land
still
remained
in
view
on
her
larboard
beam
the
fort
and
the
groups
of
anxious
spectators
on
its
rampart
were
swallowed
up
in
the
mist
then
followed
the
evolutions
necessary
to
bring
the
head
of
the
cutter
up
to
the
wind
when
she
again
began
to
wallow
her
weary
way
towards
the
north
shore
hours
now
passed
before
any
further
change
was
made
the
wind
increasing
in
force
until
even
the
dogmatical
cap
fairly
admitted
it
was
blowing
a
thorough
gale
of
wind
about
sunset
the
wore
again
to
keep
her
off
the
north
shore
during
the
hours
of
darkness
and
at
midnight
her
temporary
master
who
by
questioning
the
crew
in
an
indirect
manner
had
obtained
some
general
knowledge
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
lake
believed
himself
to
be
about
midway
between
the
two
shores
the
height
and
length
of
the
seas
aided
this
impression
and
it
must
be
added
that
cap
by
this
time
began
to
feel
a
respect
for
fresh
water
which
hours
earlier
he
would
have
derided
as
impossible
just
as
the
night
turned
the
fury
of
the
wind
became
so
great
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
bear
up
against
it
the
water
falling
on
the
deck
of
the
little
craft
in
such
masses
as
to
cause
it
to
shake
to
the
centre
and
though
a
vessel
of
singularly
lively
qualities
to
threaten
to
bury
it
beneath
its
weight
the
people
of
the
averred
that
never
before
had
they
been
out
in
such
a
tempest
which
was
true
for
possessing
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
the
rivers
and
headlands
and
havens
jasper
would
have
carried
the
cutter
in
shore
long
ere
this
and
placed
her
in
safety
in
some
secure
anchorage
but
cap
still
disdained
to
consult
the
young
master
who
continued
below
determining
to
act
like
a
mariner
of
the
broad
ocean
it
was
one
in
the
morning
when
the
was
again
got
on
the
the
head
of
the
mainsail
lowered
and
the
cutter
put
before
the
wind
although
the
canvas
now
exposed
was
merely
a
rag
in
surface
the
little
craft
nobly
justified
the
use
of
the
name
she
bore
for
eight
hours
did
she
scud
in
truth
and
it
was
almost
with
the
velocity
of
the
gulls
that
wheeled
wildly
over
her
in
the
tempest
apparently
afraid
to
alight
in
the
boiling
caldron
of
the
lake
the
dawn
of
day
brought
little
change
for
no
other
horizon
became
visible
than
the
little
circle
of
drizzling
sky
and
water
already
described
in
which
it
seemed
as
if
the
elements
were
rioting
in
a
sort
of
chaotic
confusion
during
this
time
the
crew
and
passengers
of
the
cutter
were
of
necessity
passive
jasper
and
the
pilot
remained
below
but
the
motion
of
the
vessel
having
become
easier
nearly
all
the
rest
were
on
deck
the
morning
meal
had
been
taken
in
silence
and
eye
met
eye
as
if
their
owners
asked
each
other
in
dumb
show
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
this
strife
in
the
elements
cap
however
was
perfectly
composed
and
his
face
brightened
his
step
grew
firmer
and
his
whole
air
more
assured
as
the
storm
increased
making
larger
demands
on
his
professional
skill
and
personal
spirit
he
stood
on
the
forecastle
his
arms
crossed
balancing
his
body
with
a
seaman
instinct
while
his
eyes
watched
the
caps
of
the
seas
as
they
broke
and
glanced
past
the
reeling
cutter
itself
in
such
swift
motion
as
if
they
were
the
scud
flying
athwart
the
sky
at
this
sublime
instant
one
of
the
hands
gave
the
unexpected
cry
of
a
sail
there
was
so
much
of
the
wild
and
solitary
character
of
the
wilderness
about
ontario
that
one
scarcely
expected
to
meet
with
a
vessel
on
its
waters
the
herself
to
those
who
were
in
her
resembled
a
man
threading
the
forest
alone
and
the
meeting
was
like
that
of
two
solitary
hunters
beneath
the
broad
canopy
of
leaves
that
then
covered
so
many
millions
of
acres
on
the
continent
of
america
the
peculiar
state
of
the
weather
served
to
increase
the
romantic
almost
supernatural
appearance
of
the
passage
cap
alone
regarded
it
with
practised
eyes
and
even
he
felt
his
iron
nerves
thrill
under
the
sensations
that
were
awakened
by
the
wild
features
of
the
scene
the
strange
vessel
was
about
two
cables
length
ahead
of
the
standing
by
the
wind
athwart
her
bows
and
steering
a
course
to
render
it
probable
that
the
latter
would
pass
within
a
few
yards
of
her
she
was
a
ship
and
seen
through
the
misty
medium
of
the
tempest
the
most
experienced
eye
could
detect
no
imperfection
in
her
gear
or
construction
the
only
canvas
she
had
set
was
a
and
two
small
one
forward
and
the
other
aft
still
the
power
of
the
wind
pressed
so
hard
upon
her
as
to
bear
her
down
nearly
to
her
whenever
the
hull
was
not
righted
by
the
buoyancy
of
some
wave
under
her
lee
her
spars
were
all
in
their
places
and
by
her
motion
through
the
water
which
might
have
equalled
four
knots
in
the
hour
it
was
apparent
that
she
steered
a
little
free
the
fellow
must
know
his
position
well
said
cap
as
the
cutter
flew
down
towards
the
ship
with
a
velocity
almost
equalling
that
of
the
gale
for
he
is
standing
boldly
to
the
southward
where
he
expects
to
find
anchorage
or
a
haven
no
man
in
his
senses
would
run
off
free
in
that
fashion
that
was
not
driven
to
scudding
like
ourselves
who
did
not
perfectly
understand
where
he
was
we
have
made
an
awful
run
captain
returned
the
man
to
whom
this
remark
had
been
addressed
that
is
the
french
king
ship
and
she
is
standing
in
for
the
niagara
where
her
owner
has
a
garrison
and
a
port
we
made
an
awful
run
of
it
ay
bad
luck
to
him
he
skulks
into
port
the
moment
he
sees
an
english
it
might
be
well
for
us
if
we
could
follow
him
returned
the
man
shaking
his
head
despondingly
for
we
are
getting
into
the
end
of
a
bay
up
here
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
it
is
uncertain
whether
we
ever
get
out
of
it
again
pooh
man
pooh
we
have
plenty
of
sea
room
and
a
good
english
hull
beneath
us
we
are
no
johnny
crapauds
to
hide
ourselves
behind
a
point
or
a
fort
on
account
of
a
puff
of
wind
mind
your
helm
sir
the
order
was
given
on
account
of
the
menacing
appearance
of
the
approaching
passage
the
was
now
heading
directly
for
the
of
the
frenchman
and
the
distance
between
the
two
vessels
having
diminished
to
a
hundred
yards
it
was
momentarily
questionable
if
there
was
room
to
pass
port
sir
port
shouted
cap
port
your
helm
and
pass
astern
the
crew
of
the
frenchman
were
seen
assembling
to
windward
and
a
few
muskets
were
pointed
as
if
to
order
the
people
of
the
to
keep
off
gesticulations
were
observed
but
the
sea
was
too
wild
and
menacing
to
admit
of
the
ordinary
expedients
of
war
the
water
was
dripping
from
the
muzzles
of
two
or
three
light
guns
on
board
the
ship
but
no
one
thought
of
loosening
them
for
service
in
such
a
tempest
her
black
sides
as
they
emerged
from
a
wave
glistened
and
seemed
to
frown
but
the
wind
howled
through
her
rigging
whistling
the
thousand
notes
of
a
ship
and
the
hails
and
cries
that
escape
a
frenchman
with
so
much
readiness
were
inaudible
let
him
halloo
himself
hoarse
growled
cap
this
is
no
weather
to
whisper
secrets
in
port
sir
port
the
man
at
the
helm
obeyed
and
the
next
send
of
the
sea
drove
the
down
upon
the
quarter
of
the
ship
so
near
her
that
the
old
mariner
himself
recoiled
a
step
in
a
vague
expectation
that
at
the
next
surge
ahead
she
would
drive
bows
foremost
directly
into
the
planks
of
the
other
vessel
but
this
was
not
to
be
rising
from
the
crouching
posture
she
had
taken
like
a
panther
about
to
leap
the
cutter
dashed
onward
and
at
the
next
instant
she
was
glancing
past
the
stern
of
her
enemy
just
clearing
the
end
of
her
with
her
own
lower
yard
the
young
frenchman
who
commanded
the
leaped
on
the
taffrail
and
with
that
courtesy
which
relieves
even
the
worst
acts
of
his
countrymen
he
raised
his
cap
and
smiled
a
salutation
as
the
shot
past
there
were
and
good
taste
in
this
act
of
courtesy
when
circumstances
allowed
of
no
other
communications
but
they
were
lost
on
cap
who
with
an
instinct
quite
as
true
to
his
race
shook
his
fist
menacingly
and
muttered
to
himself
ay
ay
it
d
d
lucky
for
you
i
no
armament
on
board
here
or
i
send
you
in
to
get
new
fitted
sergeant
he
a
was
civil
brother
cap
returned
the
other
lowering
his
hand
from
the
military
salute
which
his
pride
as
a
soldier
had
induced
him
to
return
was
civil
and
that
as
much
as
you
can
expect
from
a
frenchman
what
he
really
meant
by
it
no
one
can
he
is
not
heading
up
to
this
sea
without
an
object
neither
well
let
him
run
in
if
he
can
get
there
we
will
keep
the
lake
like
hearty
english
this
sounded
gloriously
but
cap
eyed
with
envy
the
glittering
black
mass
of
the
hull
her
waving
topsail
and
the
misty
tracery
of
her
spars
as
she
grew
less
and
less
distinct
and
finally
disappeared
in
the
drizzle
in
a
form
as
shadowy
as
that
of
some
unreal
image
gladly
would
he
have
followed
in
her
wake
had
he
dared
for
to
own
the
truth
the
prospect
of
another
stormy
night
in
the
midst
of
the
wild
waters
that
were
raging
around
him
brought
little
consolation
still
he
had
too
much
professional
pride
to
betray
his
uneasiness
and
those
under
his
care
relied
on
his
knowledge
and
resources
with
the
implicit
and
blind
confidence
that
the
ignorant
are
apt
to
feel
a
few
hours
succeeded
and
darkness
came
again
to
increase
the
perils
of
the
a
lull
in
the
gale
however
had
induced
cap
to
come
by
the
wind
once
more
and
throughout
the
night
the
cutter
was
as
before
as
a
matter
of
course
and
occasionally
wearing
to
keep
off
the
land
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
on
the
incidents
of
this
night
which
resembled
those
of
any
other
gale
of
wind
there
were
the
pitching
of
the
vessel
the
hissing
of
the
waters
the
dashing
of
spray
the
shocks
that
menaced
annihilation
to
the
little
craft
as
she
plunged
into
the
seas
the
undying
howl
of
the
wind
and
the
fearful
drift
the
last
was
the
most
serious
danger
for
though
exceedingly
weatherly
under
her
canvas
and
totally
without
the
was
so
light
that
the
combing
of
the
swells
would
seem
at
times
to
wash
her
down
to
leeward
with
a
velocity
as
great
as
that
of
the
surges
themselves
during
this
night
cap
slept
soundly
and
for
several
hours
the
day
was
just
dawning
when
he
felt
himself
shaken
by
the
shoulder
and
arousing
himself
he
found
the
pathfinder
standing
at
his
side
during
the
gale
the
guide
had
appeared
little
on
deck
for
his
natural
modesty
told
him
that
seamen
alone
should
interfere
with
the
management
of
the
vessel
and
he
was
willing
to
show
the
same
reliance
on
those
who
had
charge
of
the
as
he
expected
those
who
followed
through
the
forest
to
manifest
in
his
own
skill
but
he
now
thought
himself
justified
in
interfering
which
he
did
in
his
own
unsophisticated
and
peculiar
manner
sleep
is
sweet
master
cap
said
he
as
soon
as
the
eyes
of
the
latter
were
fairly
open
and
his
consciousness
had
sufficiently
returned
sleep
is
sweet
as
i
know
from
experience
but
life
is
sweeter
still
look
about
you
and
say
if
this
is
exactly
the
moment
for
a
commander
to
be
off
his
how
now
how
now
master
pathfinder
growled
cap
in
the
first
moments
of
his
awakened
faculties
are
you
too
getting
on
the
side
of
the
grumblers
when
ashore
i
admired
your
sagacity
in
running
through
the
worst
shoals
without
a
compass
and
since
we
have
been
afloat
your
meekness
and
submission
have
been
as
pleasant
as
your
confidence
on
your
own
ground
i
little
expected
such
a
summons
from
as
for
myself
master
cap
i
feel
i
have
my
gifts
and
i
believe
they
interfere
with
those
of
no
other
man
but
the
case
may
be
different
with
mabel
dunham
she
has
her
gifts
too
it
is
true
but
they
are
not
rude
like
ours
but
gentle
and
womanish
as
they
ought
to
be
it
on
her
account
that
i
speak
and
not
on
my
ay
ay
i
begin
to
understand
the
girl
is
a
good
girl
my
worthy
friend
but
she
is
a
soldier
daughter
and
a
sailor
niece
and
ought
not
to
be
too
tame
or
too
tender
in
a
gale
does
she
show
any
fear
not
she
not
she
mabel
is
a
woman
but
she
is
reasonable
and
silent
not
a
word
have
i
heard
from
her
concerning
our
doings
though
i
do
think
master
cap
she
would
like
it
better
if
jasper
were
put
into
his
proper
place
and
things
were
restored
to
their
old
situation
like
this
is
human
i
warrant
it
and
too
anything
is
better
than
an
old
uncle
and
everybody
knows
more
than
an
old
seaman
is
human
natur
master
pathfinder
and
d
if
i
the
man
to
sheer
a
fathom
starboard
or
port
for
all
the
human
natur
that
can
be
found
in
a
minx
of
twenty
ay
or
lowering
his
voice
a
little
for
all
that
can
be
paraded
in
his
majesty
regiment
of
foot
i
not
been
at
sea
forty
years
to
come
up
on
this
bit
of
fresh
water
to
be
taught
human
natur
how
this
gale
holds
out
it
blows
as
hard
at
this
moment
as
if
boreas
had
just
clapped
his
hand
upon
the
bellows
and
what
is
all
this
to
leeward
rubbing
his
eyes
land
as
sure
as
my
name
is
cap
and
high
land
the
pathfinder
made
no
immediate
answer
but
shaking
his
head
he
watched
the
expression
of
his
companion
face
with
a
look
of
strong
anxiety
in
his
own
land
as
certain
as
this
is
the
repeated
cap
a
lee
shore
and
that
too
within
a
league
of
us
with
as
pretty
a
line
of
breakers
as
one
could
find
on
the
beach
of
all
long
island
and
is
that
encouraging
or
is
it
disheartening
inquired
the
pathfinder
ha
encouraging
disheartening
why
neither
no
no
there
is
nothing
encouraging
about
it
and
as
for
disheartening
nothing
ought
to
dishearten
a
seaman
you
never
get
disheartened
or
afraid
in
the
woods
my
friend
i
not
say
that
i
not
say
that
when
the
danger
is
great
it
is
my
gift
to
see
it
and
know
it
and
to
try
to
avoid
it
else
would
my
scalp
long
since
have
been
drying
in
a
mingo
wigwam
on
this
lake
however
i
can
see
no
trail
and
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
submit
though
i
think
we
ought
to
remember
there
is
such
a
person
as
mabel
dunham
on
board
but
here
comes
her
father
and
he
will
naturally
feel
for
his
own
we
are
seriously
situated
i
believe
brother
cap
said
the
sergeant
when
he
had
reached
the
spot
by
what
i
can
gather
from
the
two
hands
on
the
forecastle
they
tell
me
the
cutter
can
not
carry
any
more
sail
and
her
drift
is
so
great
we
shall
go
ashore
in
an
hour
or
two
i
hope
their
fears
have
deceived
them
cap
made
no
reply
but
he
gazed
at
the
land
with
a
rueful
face
and
then
looked
to
windward
with
an
expression
of
ferocity
as
if
he
would
gladly
have
quarrelled
with
the
weather
it
may
be
well
brother
the
sergeant
continued
to
send
for
jasper
and
consult
him
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
there
are
no
french
here
to
dread
and
under
all
circumstances
the
boy
will
save
us
from
drowning
if
ay
ay
is
these
cursed
circumstances
that
have
done
all
the
mischief
but
let
the
fellow
come
let
him
come
a
few
questions
will
bring
the
truth
out
of
him
i
warrant
this
acquiescence
on
the
part
of
the
dogmatical
cap
was
no
sooner
obtained
than
jasper
was
sent
for
the
young
man
instantly
made
his
appearance
his
whole
air
countenance
and
mien
expressive
of
mortification
humility
and
as
his
observers
fancied
rebuked
deception
when
he
first
stepped
on
deck
jasper
cast
one
hurried
anxious
glance
around
as
if
curious
to
know
the
situation
of
the
cutter
and
that
glance
sufficed
it
would
seem
to
let
him
into
the
secret
of
all
her
perils
at
first
he
looked
to
windward
as
is
usual
with
every
seaman
then
he
turned
round
the
horizon
until
his
eye
caught
a
view
of
the
high
lands
to
leeward
when
the
whole
truth
burst
upon
him
at
once
i
sent
for
you
master
jasper
said
cap
folding
his
arms
and
balancing
his
body
with
the
dignity
of
the
forecastle
in
order
to
learn
something
about
the
haven
to
leeward
we
take
it
for
granted
you
do
not
bear
malice
so
hard
as
to
wish
to
drown
us
all
especially
the
women
and
i
suppose
you
will
be
man
enough
to
help
us
run
the
cutter
into
some
safe
berth
until
this
bit
of
a
gale
has
done
blowing
i
would
die
myself
rather
than
harm
should
come
to
mabel
dunham
the
young
man
earnestly
answered
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
cried
the
pathfinder
clapping
his
hand
kindly
on
jasper
shoulder
the
lad
is
as
true
as
the
best
compass
that
ever
ran
a
boundary
or
brought
a
man
off
from
a
blind
trail
it
is
a
mortal
sin
to
believe
humph
ejaculated
cap
especially
the
women
as
if
were
in
any
particular
danger
never
mind
young
man
we
shall
understand
each
other
by
talking
like
two
plain
seamen
do
you
know
of
any
port
under
our
lee
none
there
is
a
large
bay
at
this
end
of
the
lake
but
it
is
unknown
to
us
all
and
not
easy
of
and
this
coast
to
leeward
it
has
nothing
particular
to
recommend
it
i
suppose
it
is
a
wilderness
until
you
reach
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
in
one
direction
and
frontenac
in
the
other
north
and
west
they
tell
me
there
is
nothing
but
forest
and
prairies
for
a
thousand
thank
god
then
there
can
be
no
french
are
there
many
savages
hereaway
on
the
land
the
indians
are
to
be
found
in
all
directions
though
they
are
nowhere
very
numerous
by
accident
we
might
find
a
party
at
any
point
on
the
shore
or
we
might
pass
months
there
without
seeing
we
must
take
our
chance
then
as
to
the
blackguards
but
to
be
frank
with
you
master
western
if
this
little
unpleasant
matter
about
the
french
had
not
come
to
pass
what
would
you
now
do
with
the
cutter
i
am
a
much
younger
sailor
than
yourself
master
cap
said
jasper
modestly
and
am
hardly
fitted
to
advise
ay
ay
we
all
know
that
in
a
common
case
perhaps
not
but
this
is
an
uncommon
case
and
a
circumstance
and
on
this
bit
of
fresh
water
it
has
what
may
be
called
its
peculiarities
and
so
everything
considered
you
may
be
fitted
to
advise
even
your
own
father
at
all
events
you
can
speak
and
i
can
judge
of
your
opinions
agreeably
to
my
own
i
think
sir
before
two
hours
are
over
the
cutter
will
have
to
anchor
not
out
here
in
the
lake
no
sir
but
in
yonder
near
the
you
do
not
mean
to
say
master
you
would
anchor
on
a
lee
shore
in
a
gale
of
wind
if
i
would
save
my
vessel
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
do
master
this
is
fresh
water
with
a
vengeance
young
man
i
been
a
seafaring
animal
boy
and
man
years
and
i
never
yet
heard
of
such
a
thing
i
throw
my
overboard
before
i
would
be
guilty
of
so
lubberly
an
act
that
is
what
we
do
on
this
lake
modestly
replied
jasper
when
we
are
hard
pressed
i
daresay
we
might
do
better
had
we
been
better
that
you
might
indeed
no
no
man
induces
me
to
commit
such
a
sin
against
my
own
bringing
up
i
should
never
dare
show
my
face
inside
of
sandy
hook
again
had
i
committed
so
an
exploit
why
pathfinder
here
has
more
seamanship
in
him
than
that
comes
to
you
can
go
below
again
master
jasper
quietly
bowed
and
withdrew
still
as
he
passed
down
the
ladder
the
spectators
observed
that
he
cast
a
lingering
anxious
look
at
the
horizon
to
windward
and
the
land
to
leeward
and
then
disappeared
with
concern
strongly
expressed
in
every
lineament
of
his
face
chapter
xvii
his
still
refuted
quirks
he
still
repeats
objections
with
new
quibbles
meets
till
sinking
in
the
quicksand
he
defends
he
dies
disputing
and
the
contest
ends
cowper
as
the
soldier
wife
was
sick
in
her
berth
mabel
dunham
was
the
only
person
in
the
outer
cabin
when
jasper
returned
to
it
for
by
an
act
of
grace
in
the
sergeant
he
had
been
permitted
to
resume
his
proper
place
in
this
part
of
the
vessel
we
should
be
ascribing
too
much
simplicity
of
character
to
our
heroine
if
we
said
that
she
had
felt
no
distrust
of
the
young
man
in
consequence
of
his
arrest
but
we
should
also
be
doing
injustice
to
her
warmth
of
feeling
and
generosity
of
disposition
if
we
did
not
add
that
this
distrust
was
insignificant
and
transient
as
he
now
took
his
seat
near
her
his
whole
countenance
clouded
with
the
uneasiness
he
felt
concerning
the
situation
of
the
cutter
everything
like
suspicion
was
banished
from
her
mind
and
she
saw
in
him
only
an
injured
man
you
let
this
affair
weigh
too
heavily
on
your
mind
jasper
said
she
eagerly
or
with
that
forgetfulness
of
self
with
which
the
youthful
of
her
sex
are
wont
to
betray
their
feelings
when
a
strong
and
generous
interest
has
attained
the
ascendency
no
one
who
knows
you
can
or
does
believe
you
guilty
pathfinder
says
he
will
pledge
his
life
for
then
you
mabel
returned
the
youth
his
eyes
flashing
fire
do
not
look
upon
me
as
the
traitor
your
father
seems
to
believe
me
to
be
my
dear
father
is
a
soldier
and
is
obliged
to
act
as
one
my
daughter
is
not
and
will
think
of
you
as
she
ought
to
think
of
a
man
who
has
done
so
much
to
serve
her
mabel
i
not
used
to
talking
with
one
like
you
or
saying
all
i
think
and
feel
with
any
i
never
had
a
sister
and
my
mother
died
when
i
was
a
child
so
that
i
know
little
what
your
sex
most
likes
to
hear
mabel
would
have
given
the
world
to
know
what
lay
behind
the
teeming
word
at
which
jasper
hesitated
but
the
indefinable
and
controlling
sense
of
womanly
diffidence
made
her
suppress
her
curiosity
she
waited
in
silence
for
him
to
explain
his
own
meaning
i
wish
to
say
mabel
the
young
man
continued
after
a
pause
which
he
found
sufficiently
embarrassing
that
i
am
unused
to
the
ways
and
opinions
of
one
like
you
and
that
you
must
imagine
all
i
would
mabel
had
imagination
enough
to
fancy
anything
but
there
are
ideas
and
feelings
that
her
sex
prefer
to
have
expressed
before
they
yield
them
all
their
own
sympathies
and
she
had
a
vague
consciousness
that
these
of
jasper
might
properly
be
enumerated
in
the
class
with
a
readiness
that
belonged
to
her
sex
therefore
she
preferred
changing
the
discourse
to
permitting
it
to
proceed
any
further
in
a
manner
so
awkward
and
so
unsatisfactory
tell
me
one
thing
jasper
and
i
shall
be
content
said
she
speaking
now
with
a
firmness
which
denoted
confidence
not
only
in
herself
but
in
her
companion
you
do
not
deserve
this
cruel
suspicion
which
rests
upon
you
i
do
not
mabel
answered
jasper
looking
into
her
full
blue
eyes
with
an
openness
and
simplicity
that
might
have
shaken
stronger
distrust
as
i
hope
for
mercy
hereafter
i
do
not
i
knew
it
i
could
have
sworn
it
returned
the
girl
warmly
and
yet
my
father
means
well
but
do
not
let
this
matter
disturb
you
there
is
so
much
more
to
apprehend
from
another
quarter
just
now
that
i
scarcely
think
of
jasper
i
do
not
wish
to
alarm
you
mabel
but
if
your
uncle
could
be
persuaded
to
change
his
notions
about
handling
the
and
yet
he
is
so
much
more
experienced
than
i
am
that
he
ought
perhaps
to
place
more
reliance
on
his
own
judgment
than
on
do
you
think
the
cutter
in
any
danger
demanded
mabel
quick
as
thought
i
fear
so
at
least
she
would
have
been
thought
in
great
danger
by
us
of
the
lake
perhaps
an
old
seaman
of
the
ocean
may
have
means
of
his
own
to
take
care
of
jasper
all
agree
in
giving
you
credit
for
skill
in
managing
the
you
know
the
lake
you
know
the
cutter
you
be
the
best
judge
of
our
real
my
concern
for
you
mabel
may
make
me
more
cowardly
than
common
but
to
be
frank
i
see
but
one
method
of
keeping
the
cutter
from
being
wrecked
in
the
course
of
the
next
two
or
three
hours
and
that
your
uncle
refuses
to
take
after
all
this
may
be
my
ignorance
for
as
he
says
ontario
is
merely
fresh
you
can
not
believe
this
will
make
any
difference
think
of
my
dear
father
jasper
think
of
yourself
of
all
the
lives
that
depend
on
a
timely
word
from
you
to
save
i
think
of
you
mabel
and
that
is
more
much
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
returned
the
young
man
with
a
strength
of
expression
and
an
earnestness
of
look
that
uttered
infinitely
more
than
the
words
themselves
mabel
heart
beat
quickly
and
a
gleam
of
grateful
satisfaction
shot
across
her
blushing
features
but
the
alarm
was
too
vivid
and
too
serious
to
admit
of
much
relief
from
happier
thoughts
she
did
not
attempt
to
repress
a
look
of
gratitude
and
then
she
returned
to
the
feeling
which
was
naturally
uppermost
my
uncle
obstinacy
must
not
be
permitted
to
occasion
this
disaster
go
once
more
on
deck
jasper
and
ask
my
father
to
come
into
the
while
the
young
man
was
complying
with
this
request
mabel
sat
listening
to
the
howling
of
the
storm
and
the
dashing
of
the
water
against
the
cutter
in
a
dread
to
which
she
had
hitherto
been
a
stranger
constitutionally
an
excellent
sailor
as
the
term
is
used
among
passengers
she
had
not
hitherto
bethought
her
of
any
danger
and
had
passed
her
time
since
the
commencement
of
the
gale
in
such
womanly
employments
as
her
situation
allowed
but
now
that
alarm
was
seriously
awakened
she
did
not
fail
to
perceive
that
never
before
had
she
been
on
the
water
in
such
a
tempest
the
minute
or
two
which
elapsed
before
the
sergeant
came
appeared
an
hour
and
she
scarcely
breathed
when
she
saw
him
and
jasper
descending
the
ladder
in
company
quick
as
language
could
express
her
meaning
she
acquainted
her
father
with
jasper
opinion
of
their
situation
and
entreated
him
if
he
loved
her
or
had
any
regard
for
his
own
life
or
for
those
of
his
men
to
interfere
with
her
uncle
and
to
induce
him
to
yield
the
control
of
the
cutter
again
to
its
proper
commander
jasper
is
true
father
added
she
earnestly
and
if
false
he
could
have
no
motive
in
wrecking
us
in
this
distant
part
of
the
lake
at
the
risk
of
all
our
lives
his
own
included
i
will
pledge
my
own
life
for
his
ay
this
is
well
enough
for
a
young
woman
who
is
frightened
answered
the
more
phlegmatic
parent
but
it
might
not
be
so
excusable
in
one
in
command
of
an
expedition
jasper
may
think
the
chance
of
drowning
in
getting
ashore
fully
repaid
by
the
chance
of
escaping
as
soon
as
he
reaches
the
sergeant
dunham
father
these
exclamations
were
made
simultaneously
but
they
were
uttered
in
tones
expressive
of
different
feelings
in
jasper
surprise
was
the
emotion
uppermost
in
mabel
reproach
the
old
soldier
however
was
too
much
accustomed
to
deal
frankly
with
subordinates
to
heed
either
and
after
a
moment
thought
he
continued
as
if
neither
had
spoken
nor
is
brother
cap
a
man
likely
to
submit
to
be
taught
his
duty
on
board
a
but
father
when
all
our
lives
are
in
the
utmost
jeopardy
so
much
the
worse
the
commander
is
no
great
matter
it
is
when
things
go
wrong
that
the
best
officer
shows
himself
in
his
true
colors
charles
cap
will
not
be
likely
to
quit
the
helm
because
the
ship
is
in
danger
besides
jasper
he
says
your
proposal
in
itself
has
a
suspicious
air
about
it
and
sounds
more
like
treachery
than
he
may
think
so
but
let
him
send
for
the
pilot
and
hear
his
opinion
it
is
well
known
that
i
have
not
seen
the
man
since
yesterday
this
does
sound
reasonably
and
the
experiment
shall
be
tried
follow
me
on
deck
then
that
all
may
be
honest
and
jasper
obeyed
and
so
keen
was
the
interest
of
mabel
that
she
too
ventured
as
far
as
the
where
her
garments
were
sufficiently
protected
against
the
violence
of
the
wind
and
her
person
from
the
spray
here
maiden
modesty
induced
her
to
remain
though
an
absorbed
witness
of
what
was
passing
the
pilot
soon
appeared
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
of
concern
that
he
cast
around
at
the
scene
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
open
air
some
rumors
of
the
situation
of
the
had
found
their
way
below
it
is
true
but
in
this
instance
rumor
had
lessened
instead
of
magnifying
the
danger
he
was
allowed
a
few
minutes
to
look
about
him
and
then
the
question
was
put
as
to
the
course
which
he
thought
it
prudent
to
follow
i
see
no
means
of
saving
the
cutter
but
to
anchor
he
answered
simply
and
without
hesitation
what
out
here
in
the
lake
inquired
cap
as
he
had
previously
done
of
jasper
no
but
closer
in
just
at
the
outer
line
of
the
the
effect
of
this
communication
was
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
cap
that
there
was
a
secret
arrangement
between
her
commander
and
the
pilot
to
cast
away
the
most
probably
with
the
hope
of
effecting
their
escape
he
consequently
treated
the
opinion
of
the
latter
with
the
indifference
he
had
manifested
towards
that
of
the
former
i
tell
you
brother
dunham
said
he
in
answer
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
sergeant
against
his
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
this
double
representation
that
no
seaman
would
give
such
an
opinion
honestly
to
anchor
on
a
lee
shore
in
a
gale
of
wind
would
be
an
act
of
madness
that
i
could
never
excuse
to
the
underwriters
under
any
circumstances
so
long
as
a
rag
can
be
set
but
to
anchor
close
to
breakers
would
be
his
majesty
underwrites
the
brother
and
i
am
responsible
for
the
lives
of
my
command
these
men
are
better
acquainted
with
lake
ontario
than
we
can
possibly
be
and
i
do
think
their
telling
the
same
tale
entitles
them
to
some
uncle
said
mabel
earnestly
but
a
gesture
from
jasper
induced
the
girl
to
restrain
her
feelings
we
are
drifting
down
upon
the
breakers
so
rapidly
said
the
young
man
that
little
need
be
said
on
the
subject
half
an
hour
must
settle
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
warn
master
cap
that
the
man
among
us
will
not
be
able
to
keep
his
feet
an
instant
on
the
deck
of
this
low
craft
should
she
fairly
get
within
them
indeed
i
make
little
doubt
that
we
shall
fill
and
founder
before
the
second
line
of
rollers
is
and
how
would
anchoring
help
the
matter
demanded
cap
furiously
as
if
he
felt
that
jasper
was
responsible
for
the
effects
of
the
gale
as
well
as
for
the
opinion
he
had
just
given
it
would
at
least
do
no
harm
mildly
replied
by
bringing
the
cutter
head
to
sea
we
should
lessen
her
drift
and
even
if
we
dragged
through
the
breakers
it
would
be
with
the
least
possible
danger
i
hope
master
cap
you
will
allow
the
pilot
and
myself
to
for
anchoring
since
the
precaution
may
do
good
and
can
do
no
overhaul
your
ranges
if
you
will
and
get
your
anchors
clear
with
all
my
heart
we
are
now
in
a
situation
that
can
not
be
much
affected
by
anything
of
that
sort
sergeant
a
word
with
you
aft
here
if
you
cap
led
his
out
of
and
then
with
more
of
human
feeling
in
his
voice
and
manner
than
he
was
apt
to
exhibit
he
opened
his
heart
on
the
subject
of
their
real
situation
this
is
a
melancholy
affair
for
poor
mabel
said
he
blowing
his
nose
and
speaking
with
a
slight
tremor
you
and
i
sergeant
are
old
fellows
and
used
to
being
near
death
if
not
to
actually
dying
our
trades
fit
us
for
such
scenes
but
poor
mabel
she
is
an
affectionate
and
girl
and
i
had
hoped
to
see
her
comfortably
settled
and
a
mother
before
my
time
came
well
well
we
must
take
the
bad
with
the
good
in
every
and
the
only
serious
objection
that
an
old
seafaring
man
can
with
propriety
make
to
such
an
event
is
that
it
should
happen
on
this
bit
of
d
d
fresh
sergeant
dunham
was
a
brave
man
and
had
shown
his
spirit
in
scenes
that
looked
much
more
appalling
than
this
but
on
all
such
occasions
he
had
been
able
to
act
his
part
against
his
foes
while
here
he
was
pressed
upon
by
an
enemy
whom
he
had
no
means
of
resisting
for
himself
he
cared
far
less
than
for
his
daughter
feeling
some
of
that
which
seldom
deserts
a
man
of
firmness
who
is
in
vigorous
health
and
who
has
been
accustomed
to
personal
exertions
in
moments
of
jeopardy
but
as
respects
mabel
he
saw
no
means
of
escape
and
with
a
father
fondness
he
at
once
determined
that
if
either
was
doomed
to
perish
he
and
his
daughter
must
perish
together
do
you
think
this
must
come
to
pass
he
asked
of
cap
firmly
but
with
strong
feeling
twenty
minutes
will
carry
us
into
the
breakers
and
look
for
yourself
sergeant
what
chance
will
even
the
stoutest
man
among
us
have
in
that
caldron
to
leeward
the
prospect
was
indeed
little
calculated
to
encourage
hope
by
this
time
the
was
within
a
mile
of
the
shore
on
which
the
gale
was
blowing
at
right
angles
with
a
violence
that
forbade
the
idea
of
showing
any
additional
canvas
with
a
view
to
claw
off
the
small
portion
of
the
mainsail
actually
set
and
which
merely
served
to
keep
the
head
of
the
so
near
the
wind
as
to
prevent
the
waves
from
breaking
over
her
quivered
under
the
gusts
as
if
at
each
moment
the
stout
threads
which
held
the
complicated
fabric
together
were
about
to
be
torn
asunder
the
drizzle
had
ceased
but
the
air
for
a
hundred
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
filled
with
dazzling
spray
which
had
an
appearance
not
unlike
that
of
a
brilliant
mist
while
above
all
the
sun
was
shining
gloriously
in
a
cloudless
sky
jasper
had
noted
the
omen
and
had
foretold
that
it
announced
a
speedy
termination
to
the
gale
though
the
next
hour
or
two
must
decide
their
fate
between
the
cutter
and
the
shore
the
view
was
still
more
wild
and
appalling
the
breakers
extended
nearly
half
a
mile
while
the
water
within
their
line
was
white
with
foam
the
air
above
them
was
so
far
filled
with
vapor
and
spray
as
to
render
the
land
beyond
hazy
and
indistinct
still
it
could
be
seen
that
the
latter
was
high
not
a
usual
thing
for
the
shores
of
ontario
and
that
it
was
covered
with
the
verdant
mantle
of
the
interminable
forest
while
the
sergeant
and
cap
were
gazing
at
this
scene
in
silence
jasper
and
his
people
were
actively
engaged
on
the
forecastle
no
sooner
had
the
young
man
received
permission
to
resume
his
old
employment
than
appealing
to
some
of
the
soldiers
for
aid
he
mustered
five
or
six
assistants
and
set
about
in
earnest
the
performance
of
a
duty
which
had
been
too
long
delayed
on
these
narrow
waters
anchors
are
never
stowed
or
cables
that
are
intended
for
service
unbent
and
jasper
was
saved
much
of
the
labor
that
would
have
been
necessary
in
a
vessel
at
sea
the
two
bowers
were
soon
ready
to
be
let
go
ranges
of
the
cables
were
overhauled
and
then
the
party
paused
to
look
about
them
no
changes
for
the
better
had
occurred
but
the
cutter
was
falling
slowly
in
and
each
instant
rendered
it
more
certain
that
she
could
not
gain
an
inch
to
windward
one
long
earnest
survey
of
the
lake
ended
jasper
gave
new
orders
in
a
similar
manner
to
prove
how
much
he
thought
that
the
time
pressed
two
kedges
were
got
on
deck
and
hawsers
were
bent
to
them
the
inner
ends
of
the
hawsers
were
bent
in
their
turns
to
the
crowns
of
the
anchors
and
everything
was
got
ready
to
throw
them
overboard
at
the
proper
moment
these
preparations
completed
jasper
manner
changed
from
the
excitement
of
exertion
to
a
look
of
calm
but
settled
concern
he
quitted
the
forecastle
where
the
seas
were
dashing
inboard
at
every
plunge
of
the
vessel
the
duty
just
mentioned
having
been
executed
with
the
bodies
of
the
crew
frequently
buried
in
the
water
and
walked
to
a
drier
part
of
the
deck
aft
here
he
was
met
by
the
pathfinder
who
was
standing
near
mabel
and
the
quartermaster
most
of
those
on
board
with
the
exception
of
the
individuals
who
have
already
been
particularly
mentioned
were
below
some
seeking
relief
from
physical
suffering
on
their
pallets
and
others
tardily
bethinking
them
of
their
sins
for
the
first
time
most
probably
since
her
keel
had
dipped
into
the
limpid
waters
of
ontario
the
voice
of
prayer
was
heard
on
board
the
jasper
commenced
his
friend
the
guide
i
have
been
of
no
use
this
morning
for
my
gifts
are
of
little
account
as
you
know
in
a
vessel
like
this
but
should
it
please
god
to
let
the
sergeant
daughter
reach
the
shore
alive
my
acquaintance
with
the
forest
may
still
carry
her
through
in
safety
to
the
is
a
fearful
distance
thither
pathfinder
mabel
rejoined
the
party
being
so
near
together
that
all
which
was
said
by
one
was
overheard
by
the
others
i
am
afraid
none
of
us
could
live
to
reach
the
it
would
be
a
risky
path
mabel
and
a
crooked
one
though
some
of
your
sex
have
undergone
even
more
than
that
in
this
wilderness
but
jasper
either
you
or
i
or
both
of
us
must
man
this
bark
canoe
mabel
only
chance
will
lie
in
getting
through
the
breakers
in
i
would
willingly
man
anything
to
save
mabel
answered
jasper
with
a
melancholy
smile
but
no
human
hand
pathfinder
could
carry
that
canoe
through
yonder
breakers
in
a
gale
like
this
i
have
hopes
from
anchoring
after
all
for
once
before
have
we
saved
the
in
an
extremity
nearly
as
great
as
if
we
are
to
anchor
jasper
the
sergeant
inquired
why
not
do
it
at
once
every
foot
we
lose
in
drifting
now
would
come
into
the
distance
we
shall
probably
drag
when
the
anchors
are
let
jasper
drew
nearer
to
the
sergeant
and
took
his
hand
pressing
it
earnestly
and
in
a
way
to
denote
strong
almost
uncontrollable
feelings
sergeant
dunham
said
he
solemnly
you
are
a
good
man
though
you
have
treated
me
harshly
in
this
business
you
love
your
daughter
that
you
can
not
doubt
returned
the
sergeant
huskily
will
you
give
her
give
us
all
the
only
chance
for
life
that
is
left
what
would
you
have
me
do
boy
what
would
you
have
me
do
i
have
acted
according
to
my
judgment
hitherto
what
would
you
have
me
do
support
me
against
master
cap
for
five
minutes
and
all
that
man
can
do
towards
saving
the
shall
be
the
sergeant
hesitated
for
he
was
too
much
of
a
disciplinarian
to
fly
in
the
face
of
regular
orders
he
disliked
the
appearance
of
vacillation
too
and
then
he
had
a
profound
respect
for
his
seamanship
while
he
was
deliberating
cap
came
from
the
post
he
had
some
time
occupied
which
was
at
the
side
of
the
man
at
the
helm
and
drew
nigh
the
group
master
said
he
as
soon
as
near
enough
to
be
heard
i
have
come
to
inquire
if
you
know
any
spot
near
by
where
this
cutter
can
be
beached
the
moment
has
arrived
when
we
are
driven
to
this
hard
that
instant
of
indecision
on
the
part
of
cap
secured
the
triumph
of
jasper
looking
at
the
sergeant
the
young
man
received
a
nod
that
assured
him
of
all
he
asked
and
he
lost
not
one
of
those
moments
that
were
getting
to
be
so
very
precious
shall
i
take
the
helm
he
inquired
of
cap
and
see
if
we
can
reach
a
creek
that
lies
to
leeward
do
so
do
so
said
the
other
hemming
to
clear
his
throat
for
he
felt
oppressed
by
a
responsibility
that
weighed
all
the
heavier
on
his
shoulders
on
account
of
his
ignorance
do
so
since
to
be
frank
with
you
i
can
see
nothing
better
to
be
done
we
must
beach
or
jasper
required
no
more
springing
aft
he
soon
had
the
tiller
in
his
own
hands
the
pilot
was
prepared
for
what
was
to
follow
and
at
a
sign
from
his
young
commander
the
rag
of
sail
that
had
so
long
been
set
was
taken
in
at
that
moment
jasper
watching
his
time
put
the
helm
up
the
head
of
a
staysail
was
loosened
forward
and
the
light
cutter
as
if
conscious
she
was
now
under
the
control
of
familiar
hands
fell
off
and
was
soon
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
this
perilous
instant
was
passed
in
safety
and
at
the
next
moment
the
little
vessel
appeared
flying
down
toward
the
breakers
at
a
rate
that
threatened
instant
destruction
the
distances
had
become
so
short
that
five
or
six
minutes
sufficed
for
all
that
jasper
wished
and
he
put
the
helm
down
again
when
the
bows
of
the
came
up
to
the
wind
notwithstanding
the
turbulence
of
the
waters
as
gracefully
as
the
duck
varies
its
line
of
direction
on
the
glassy
pond
a
sign
from
jasper
set
all
in
motion
on
the
forecastle
and
a
kedge
was
thrown
from
each
bow
the
fearful
nature
of
the
drift
was
now
apparent
even
to
mabel
eyes
for
the
two
hawsers
ran
out
like
as
soon
as
they
straightened
to
a
slight
strain
both
anchors
were
let
go
and
cable
was
given
to
each
nearly
to
the
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
to
snub
so
light
a
craft
with
of
a
quality
better
than
common
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
from
the
moment
when
jasper
went
to
the
helm
the
was
riding
head
to
sea
with
the
two
cables
stretched
ahead
in
lines
that
resembled
bars
of
iron
this
is
not
well
done
master
jasper
angrily
exclaimed
cap
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
trick
which
had
been
played
him
this
is
not
well
done
sir
i
order
you
to
cut
and
to
beach
the
cutter
without
a
moment
no
one
however
seemed
disposed
to
comply
with
this
order
for
so
long
as
saw
fit
to
command
his
own
people
were
disposed
to
obey
finding
that
the
men
remained
passive
cap
who
believed
they
were
in
the
utmost
peril
turned
fiercely
to
jasper
and
renewed
his
remonstrances
you
did
not
head
for
your
pretended
creek
added
he
after
dealing
in
some
objurgatory
remarks
that
we
do
not
deem
it
necessary
to
record
but
steered
for
that
bluff
where
every
soul
on
board
would
have
been
drowned
had
we
gone
and
you
wish
to
cut
and
put
every
soul
ashore
at
that
very
spot
jasper
retorted
a
little
drily
throw
a
overboard
and
ascertain
the
drift
cap
now
roared
to
the
people
forward
a
sign
from
jasper
sustaining
this
order
it
was
instantly
obeyed
all
on
deck
watched
with
nearly
breathless
interest
the
result
of
the
experiment
the
lead
was
no
sooner
on
the
bottom
than
the
line
tended
forward
and
in
about
two
minutes
it
was
seen
that
the
cutter
had
drifted
her
length
dead
in
towards
the
bluff
jasper
looked
gravely
for
he
well
knew
nothing
would
hold
the
vessel
did
she
get
within
the
vortex
of
the
breakers
the
first
line
of
which
was
appearing
and
disappearing
about
a
cable
length
directly
under
their
stern
traitor
exclaimed
cap
shaking
a
finger
at
the
young
commander
though
passion
choked
the
rest
you
must
answer
for
this
with
your
life
he
added
after
a
short
pause
if
i
were
at
the
head
of
this
expedition
sergeant
i
would
hang
him
at
the
end
of
the
lest
he
escape
moderate
your
feelings
brother
be
more
moderate
i
beseech
you
jasper
appears
to
have
done
all
for
the
best
and
matters
may
not
be
so
bad
as
you
believe
why
did
he
not
run
for
the
creek
he
mentioned
why
has
he
brought
us
here
dead
to
windward
of
that
bluff
and
to
a
spot
where
even
the
breakers
are
only
of
half
the
ordinary
width
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
drown
all
on
board
i
headed
for
the
bluff
for
the
precise
reason
that
the
breakers
are
so
narrow
at
this
spot
answered
jasper
mildly
though
his
gorge
had
risen
at
the
language
the
other
held
do
you
mean
to
tell
an
old
seaman
like
me
that
this
cutter
could
live
in
those
breakers
i
do
not
sir
i
think
she
would
fill
and
swamp
if
driven
into
the
first
line
of
them
i
am
certain
she
would
never
reach
the
shore
on
her
bottom
if
fairly
entered
i
hope
to
keep
her
clear
of
them
with
a
drift
of
her
length
in
a
minute
the
backing
of
the
anchors
does
not
yet
fairly
tell
nor
do
i
even
hope
that
will
entirely
bring
her
on
what
then
do
you
rely
to
moor
a
craft
head
and
stern
by
faith
hope
and
charity
no
sir
i
trust
to
the
i
headed
for
the
bluff
because
i
knew
that
it
was
stronger
at
that
point
than
at
any
other
and
because
we
could
get
nearer
in
with
the
land
without
entering
the
this
was
said
with
spirit
though
without
any
particular
show
of
resentment
its
effect
on
cap
was
marked
the
feeling
that
was
uppermost
being
evidently
that
of
surprise
he
repeated
who
the
devil
ever
heard
of
saving
a
vessel
from
going
ashore
by
the
this
may
never
happen
on
the
ocean
sir
jasper
answered
modestly
but
we
have
known
it
to
happen
the
lad
is
right
brother
put
in
the
sergeant
for
though
i
do
not
well
understand
it
i
have
often
heard
the
sailors
of
the
lake
speak
of
such
a
thing
we
shall
do
well
to
trust
to
jasper
in
this
cap
grumbled
and
swore
but
as
there
was
no
remedy
he
was
compelled
to
acquiesce
jasper
being
now
called
on
to
explain
what
he
meant
by
the
gave
this
account
of
the
matter
the
water
that
was
driven
up
on
the
shore
by
the
gale
was
necessarily
compelled
to
find
its
level
by
returning
to
the
lake
by
some
secret
channels
this
could
not
be
done
on
the
surface
where
both
wind
and
waves
were
constantly
urging
it
towards
the
land
and
it
necessarily
formed
a
sort
of
lower
eddy
by
means
of
which
it
flowed
back
again
to
its
ancient
and
proper
bed
this
inferior
current
had
received
the
name
of
the
and
as
it
would
necessarily
act
on
the
bottom
of
a
vessel
which
drew
as
much
water
as
the
jasper
trusted
to
the
aid
of
this
reaction
to
keep
his
cables
from
parting
in
short
the
upper
and
lower
currents
would
in
a
manner
counteract
each
other
simple
and
ingenious
as
was
this
theory
however
as
yet
there
was
little
evidence
of
its
being
reduced
to
practice
the
drift
continued
though
as
the
kedges
and
hawsers
with
which
the
anchors
were
backed
took
the
strains
it
became
sensibly
less
at
length
the
man
at
the
lead
announced
the
joyful
intelligence
that
the
anchors
had
ceased
to
drag
and
that
the
vessel
had
brought
up
at
this
precise
moment
the
first
line
of
breakers
was
about
a
hundred
feet
astern
of
the
even
appearing
to
approach
much
nearer
as
the
foam
vanished
and
returned
on
the
raging
surges
jasper
sprang
forward
and
casting
a
glance
over
the
bows
he
smiled
in
triumph
as
he
pointed
exultingly
to
the
cables
instead
of
resembling
bars
of
iron
in
rigidity
as
before
they
were
curving
downwards
and
to
a
seaman
senses
it
was
evident
that
the
cutter
rose
and
fell
on
the
seas
as
they
came
in
with
the
ease
of
a
ship
in
a
when
the
power
of
the
wind
is
relieved
by
the
counteracting
pressure
of
the
water
is
the
he
exclaimed
with
delight
fairly
bounding
along
the
deck
to
steady
the
helm
in
order
that
the
cutter
might
ride
still
easier

us

remarks
were
now
little
heeded

was
half
an
hour
of
uncertainty
and
doubt

period

lead
was
anxiously
watched
and

feeling

over
all

slept

it
was
near
noon
when
the
gale
broke
and
then
its
force
abated
as
suddenly
as
its
violence
had
arisen
in
less
than
two
hours
after
the
wind
fell
the
surface
of
the
lake
though
still
agitated
was
no
longer
glittering
with
foam
and
in
double
that
time
the
entire
sheet
presented
the
ordinary
scene
of
disturbed
water
that
was
unbroken
by
the
violence
of
a
tempest
still
the
waves
came
rolling
incessantly
towards
the
shore
and
the
lines
of
breakers
remained
though
the
spray
had
ceased
to
fly
the
combing
of
the
swells
was
more
moderate
and
all
that
there
was
of
violence
proceeded
from
the
impulsion
of
wind
which
had
abated
as
it
was
impossible
to
make
head
against
the
sea
that
was
still
up
with
the
light
opposing
air
that
blew
from
the
eastward
all
thoughts
of
getting
under
way
that
afternoon
were
abandoned
jasper
who
had
now
quietly
resumed
the
command
of
the
busied
himself
however
in
the
anchors
which
were
lifted
in
succession
the
kedges
that
backed
them
were
weighed
and
everything
was
got
in
readiness
for
a
prompt
departure
as
soon
as
the
state
of
the
weather
would
allow
in
the
meantime
they
who
had
no
concern
with
these
duties
sought
such
means
of
amusement
as
their
peculiar
circumstances
allowed
as
is
common
with
those
who
are
unused
to
the
confinement
of
a
vessel
mabel
cast
wistful
eyes
towards
the
shore
nor
was
it
long
before
she
expressed
a
wish
that
it
were
possible
to
land
the
pathfinder
was
near
her
at
the
time
and
he
assured
her
that
nothing
would
be
easier
as
they
had
a
bark
canoe
on
deck
which
was
the
best
possible
mode
of
conveyance
to
go
through
a
surf
after
the
usual
doubts
and
misgivings
the
sergeant
was
appealed
to
his
opinion
proved
to
be
favorable
and
preparations
to
carry
the
whim
into
effect
were
immediately
made
the
party
which
was
to
land
consisted
of
sergeant
dunham
his
daughter
and
the
pathfinder
accustomed
to
the
canoe
mabel
took
her
seat
in
the
centre
with
great
steadiness
her
father
was
placed
in
the
bows
while
the
guide
assumed
the
office
of
conductor
by
steering
in
the
stern
there
was
little
need
of
impelling
the
canoe
by
means
of
the
paddle
for
the
rollers
sent
it
forward
at
moments
with
a
violence
that
set
every
effort
to
govern
its
movements
at
defiance
more
than
once
before
the
shore
was
reached
mabel
repented
of
her
temerity
but
pathfinder
encouraged
her
and
really
manifested
so
much
coolness
and
strength
of
arm
himself
that
even
a
female
might
have
hesitated
about
owning
all
her
apprehensions
our
heroine
was
no
coward
and
while
she
felt
the
novelty
of
her
situation
in
landing
through
a
surf
she
also
experienced
a
fair
proportion
of
its
wild
delight
at
moments
indeed
her
heart
was
in
her
mouth
as
the
bubble
of
a
boat
floated
on
the
very
crest
of
a
foaming
breaker
appearing
to
skim
the
water
like
a
swallow
and
then
she
flushed
and
laughed
as
left
by
the
glancing
element
they
appeared
to
linger
behind
as
if
ashamed
of
having
been
outdone
in
the
headlong
race
a
few
minutes
sufficed
for
this
excitement
for
though
the
distance
between
the
cutter
and
the
land
considerably
exceeded
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
intermediate
space
was
passed
in
a
very
few
minutes
on
landing
the
sergeant
kissed
his
daughter
kindly
for
he
was
so
much
of
a
soldier
as
always
to
feel
more
at
home
on
than
when
afloat
and
taking
his
gun
he
announced
his
intention
to
pass
an
hour
in
quest
of
game
pathfinder
will
remain
near
you
girl
and
no
doubt
he
will
tell
you
some
of
the
traditions
of
this
part
of
the
world
or
some
of
his
own
experiences
with
the
the
guide
laughed
promised
to
have
a
care
of
mabel
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
father
had
ascended
a
steep
acclivity
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
the
others
took
another
direction
which
after
a
few
minutes
of
a
sharp
ascent
also
brought
them
to
a
small
naked
point
on
the
promontory
where
the
eye
overlooked
an
extensive
and
very
peculiar
panorama
here
mabel
seated
herself
on
a
fragment
of
fallen
rock
to
recover
her
breath
and
strength
while
her
companion
on
whose
sinews
no
personal
exertion
seemed
to
make
any
impression
stood
at
her
side
leaning
in
his
own
and
not
ungraceful
manner
on
his
long
rifle
several
minutes
passed
and
neither
spoke
mabel
in
particular
being
lost
in
admiration
of
the
view
the
position
the
two
had
obtained
was
sufficiently
elevated
to
command
a
wide
reach
of
the
lake
which
stretched
away
towards
the
in
a
boundless
sheet
glittering
beneath
the
rays
of
an
afternoon
sun
and
yet
betraying
the
remains
of
that
agitation
which
it
had
endured
while
tossed
by
the
late
tempest
the
land
set
bounds
to
its
limits
in
a
huge
crescent
disappearing
in
distance
towards
the
and
the
north
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
nothing
but
forest
was
visible
not
even
a
solitary
sign
of
civilization
breaking
in
upon
the
uniform
and
grand
magnificence
of
nature
the
gale
had
driven
the
beyond
the
line
of
those
forts
with
which
the
french
were
then
endeavoring
to
gird
the
english
north
american
possessions
for
following
the
channels
of
communication
between
the
great
lakes
their
posts
were
on
the
banks
of
the
niagara
while
our
adventurers
had
reached
a
point
many
leagues
westward
of
that
celebrated
strait
the
cutter
rode
at
single
anchor
without
the
breakers
resembling
some
and
toy
intended
rather
for
a
glass
case
than
for
struggles
with
the
elements
which
she
had
so
lately
gone
through
while
the
canoe
lay
on
the
narrow
beach
just
out
of
reach
of
the
waves
that
came
booming
upon
the
land
a
speck
upon
the
shingles
we
are
very
far
here
from
human
habitations
exclaimed
mabel
when
after
a
long
survey
of
the
scene
its
principal
peculiarities
forced
themselves
on
her
active
and
ever
brilliant
imagination
this
is
indeed
being
on
a
have
they
more
sightly
scenes
than
this
nearer
the
sea
and
around
their
large
towns
demanded
pathfinder
with
an
interest
he
was
apt
to
discover
in
such
a
subject
i
will
not
say
that
there
is
more
to
remind
one
of
his
there
than
here
less
perhaps
to
remind
one
of
ay
mabel
that
is
what
my
own
feelings
say
i
am
but
a
poor
hunter
i
know
untaught
and
unlarned
but
god
is
as
near
me
in
this
my
home
as
he
is
near
the
king
in
his
royal
who
can
doubt
it
returned
mabel
looking
from
the
view
up
into
the
but
honest
face
of
her
companion
though
not
without
surprise
at
the
energy
of
his
manner
one
feels
nearer
to
god
in
such
a
spot
i
think
than
when
the
mind
is
distracted
by
the
objects
of
the
you
say
all
i
wish
to
say
myself
mabel
but
in
so
much
plainer
speech
that
you
make
me
ashamed
of
wishing
to
let
others
know
what
i
feel
on
such
matters
i
have
coasted
this
lake
in
search
of
skins
afore
the
war
and
have
been
here
already
not
at
this
very
spot
for
we
landed
yonder
where
you
may
see
the
blasted
oak
that
stands
above
the
cluster
of
hemlocks
how
pathfinder
can
you
remember
all
these
trifles
so
accurately
these
are
our
streets
and
houses
our
churches
and
palaces
remember
them
indeed
i
once
made
an
appointment
with
the
big
sarpent
to
meet
at
twelve
at
noon
near
the
foot
of
a
certain
pine
at
the
end
of
six
months
when
neither
of
us
was
within
three
hundred
miles
of
the
spot
the
tree
stood
and
stands
still
unless
the
judgment
of
providence
has
lighted
on
that
too
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
fifty
miles
from
any
settlement
but
in
a
most
extraordinary
neighborhood
for
and
did
you
meet
at
that
very
spot
and
hour
does
the
sun
rise
and
set
when
i
reached
the
tree
i
found
the
sarpent
leaning
against
its
trunk
with
torn
leggings
and
muddied
moecassins
the
delaware
had
got
into
a
swamp
and
it
worried
him
not
a
little
to
find
his
way
out
of
it
but
as
the
sun
which
comes
over
the
eastern
hills
in
the
morning
goes
down
behind
the
western
at
night
so
was
he
true
to
time
and
place
no
fear
of
chingachgook
when
there
is
either
a
friend
or
an
enemy
in
the
case
he
is
equally
sartain
with
and
where
is
the
delaware
now
why
is
he
not
with
us
he
is
scouting
on
the
mingo
trail
where
i
ought
to
have
been
too
but
for
a
great
human
you
seem
above
beyond
superior
to
all
infirmity
pathfinder
i
never
yet
met
with
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
so
little
liable
to
the
weaknesses
of
if
you
mean
in
the
way
of
health
and
strength
mabel
providence
has
been
kind
to
me
though
i
fancy
the
open
air
long
hunts
active
scoutings
forest
fare
and
the
sleep
of
a
good
conscience
may
always
keep
the
doctors
at
a
distance
but
i
am
human
after
all
yes
i
find
i
very
human
in
some
of
my
mabel
looked
surprised
and
it
would
be
no
more
than
delineating
the
character
of
her
sex
if
we
added
that
her
sweet
countenance
expressed
a
good
deal
of
curiosity
too
though
her
tongue
was
more
discreet
there
is
something
bewitching
in
this
wild
life
of
yours
pathfinder
she
exclaimed
a
tinge
of
enthusiasm
mantling
her
cheeks
i
find
fast
getting
to
be
a
frontier
girl
and
am
coming
to
love
all
this
grand
silence
of
the
woods
the
towns
seem
tame
to
me
and
as
my
father
will
probably
pass
the
remainder
of
his
days
here
where
he
has
already
lived
so
long
i
begin
to
feel
that
i
should
be
happy
to
continue
with
him
and
not
to
return
to
the
the
woods
are
never
silent
mabel
to
such
as
understand
their
meaning
days
at
a
time
have
i
travelled
them
alone
without
feeling
the
want
of
company
and
as
for
conversation
for
such
as
can
comprehend
their
language
there
is
no
want
of
rational
and
instructive
i
believe
you
are
happier
when
alone
pathfinder
than
when
mingling
with
your
i
will
not
say
that
i
will
not
say
exactly
that
i
have
seen
the
time
when
i
have
thought
that
god
was
sufficient
for
me
in
the
forest
and
that
i
have
craved
no
more
than
his
bounty
and
his
care
but
other
feelings
have
got
uppermost
and
i
suppose
natur
will
have
its
way
all
other
creatur
mate
mabel
and
it
was
intended
man
should
do
so
and
have
you
never
bethought
you
of
seeking
a
wife
pathfinder
to
share
your
fortunes
inquired
the
girl
with
the
directness
and
simplicity
that
the
pure
of
heart
and
the
undesigning
are
the
most
apt
to
manifest
and
with
that
feeling
of
affection
which
is
inbred
in
her
sex
to
me
it
seems
you
only
want
a
home
to
return
to
from
your
wanderings
to
render
your
life
completely
happy
were
i
a
man
it
would
be
my
delight
to
roam
through
these
forests
at
will
or
to
sail
over
this
beautiful
i
understand
you
mabel
and
god
bless
you
for
thinking
of
the
welfare
of
men
as
humble
as
we
are
we
have
our
pleasures
it
is
true
as
well
as
our
gifts
but
we
might
be
happier
yes
i
do
think
we
might
be
happier
in
what
way
pathfinder
in
this
pure
air
with
these
cool
and
shaded
forests
to
wander
through
this
lovely
lake
to
gaze
at
and
sail
upon
with
clear
consciences
and
abundance
for
all
their
real
wants
men
ought
to
be
nothing
less
than
as
perfectly
happy
as
their
infirmities
will
every
creatur
has
its
gifts
mabel
and
men
have
theirs
answered
the
guide
looking
stealthily
at
his
beautiful
companion
whose
cheeks
had
flushed
and
eyes
brightened
under
the
ardor
of
feelings
excited
by
the
novelty
of
her
striking
situation
and
all
must
obey
them
do
you
see
yonder
pigeon
that
is
just
alightin
on
the
beach
here
in
a
line
with
the
fallen
chestnut
certainly
it
is
the
only
thing
stirring
with
life
in
it
besides
ourselves
that
is
to
be
seen
in
this
vast
not
so
mabel
not
so
providence
makes
nothing
that
lives
to
live
quite
alone
here
is
its
mate
just
rising
on
the
wing
it
has
been
feeding
near
the
other
beach
but
it
will
not
long
be
separated
from
its
i
understand
you
pathfinder
returned
mabel
smiling
sweetly
though
as
calmly
as
if
the
discourse
was
with
her
father
but
a
hunter
may
find
a
mate
even
in
this
wild
region
the
indian
girls
are
affectionate
and
true
i
know
for
such
was
the
wife
of
arrowhead
to
a
husband
who
oftener
frowned
than
that
would
never
do
mabel
and
good
would
never
come
of
it
kind
must
cling
to
kind
and
country
to
country
if
one
would
find
happiness
if
indeed
i
could
meet
with
one
like
you
who
would
consent
to
be
a
hunter
wife
and
who
would
not
scorn
my
ignorance
and
rudeness
then
indeed
would
all
the
toil
of
the
past
appear
like
the
sporting
of
the
young
deer
and
all
the
future
like
one
like
me
a
girl
of
my
years
and
indiscretion
would
hardly
make
a
fit
companion
for
the
boldest
scout
and
surest
hunter
on
the
ah
mabel
i
fear
me
that
i
have
been
improving
a
gifts
with
a
natur
such
a
character
would
insure
a
wife
in
an
indian
surely
surely
pathfinder
you
would
not
think
of
choosing
one
so
ignorant
so
frivolous
so
vain
and
so
inexperienced
as
i
for
your
wife
mabel
would
have
added
and
as
young
but
an
instinctive
feeling
of
delicacy
repressed
the
words
and
why
not
mabel
if
you
are
ignorant
of
frontier
usages
you
know
more
than
all
of
us
of
pleasant
anecdotes
and
town
customs
as
for
frivolous
i
know
not
what
it
means
but
if
it
signifies
beauty
me
i
fear
it
is
no
fault
in
my
eyes
vain
you
are
not
as
is
seen
by
the
kind
manner
in
which
you
listen
to
all
my
idle
tales
about
scoutings
and
trails
and
as
for
experience
that
will
come
with
years
besides
mabel
i
fear
men
think
little
of
these
matters
when
they
are
about
to
take
wives
i
pathfinder
your
words
your
looks
surely
all
this
is
meant
in
trifling
you
speak
in
pleasantry
to
me
it
is
always
agreeable
to
be
near
you
mabel
and
i
should
sleep
sounder
this
blessed
night
than
i
have
done
for
a
week
past
could
i
think
that
you
find
such
discourse
as
pleasant
as
i
we
shall
not
say
that
mabel
dunham
had
not
believed
herself
a
favorite
with
the
guide
this
her
quick
feminine
sagacity
had
early
discovered
and
perhaps
she
had
occasionally
thought
there
had
mingled
with
his
regard
and
friendship
some
of
that
manly
tenderness
which
the
ruder
sex
must
be
coarse
indeed
not
to
show
on
occasions
to
the
gentler
but
the
idea
that
he
seriously
sought
her
for
his
wife
had
never
before
crossed
the
mind
of
the
spirited
and
ingenuous
girl
now
however
a
gleam
of
something
like
the
truth
broke
in
upon
her
imagination
less
induced
by
the
words
of
her
companion
perhaps
than
by
his
manner
looking
earnestly
into
the
rugged
honest
countenance
of
the
scout
mabel
own
features
became
concerned
and
grave
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
with
a
gentleness
of
manner
that
attracted
him
to
her
even
more
powerfully
than
the
words
themselves
were
calculated
to
repel
you
and
i
should
understand
each
other
pathfinder
said
she
with
an
earnest
sincerity
nor
should
there
be
any
cloud
between
us
you
are
too
upright
and
frank
to
meet
with
anything
but
sincerity
and
frankness
in
return
surely
surely
all
this
means
nothing
has
no
other
connection
with
your
feelings
than
such
a
friendship
as
one
of
your
wisdom
and
character
would
naturally
feel
for
a
girl
like
me
i
believe
it
all
mabel
yes
i
do
the
sergeant
tells
me
he
had
such
feelings
towards
your
own
mother
and
i
think
i
seen
something
like
it
in
the
young
people
i
have
from
time
to
time
guided
through
the
wilderness
yes
yes
i
daresay
it
all
enough
and
that
makes
it
come
so
easy
and
is
a
great
comfort
to
pathfinder
your
words
make
me
uneasy
speak
plainer
or
change
the
subject
for
ever
you
do
not
can
not
mean
that
you
can
not
wish
me
to
understand
even
the
tongue
of
the
spirited
mabel
faltered
and
she
shrank
with
maiden
shame
from
adding
what
she
wished
so
earnestly
to
say
rallying
her
courage
however
and
determined
to
know
all
as
soon
and
as
plainly
as
possible
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
continued
i
mean
pathfinder
that
you
do
not
wish
me
to
understand
that
you
seriously
think
of
me
as
a
wife
i
do
mabel
that
it
that
just
it
and
you
have
put
the
matter
in
a
much
better
point
of
view
than
i
with
my
forest
gifts
and
frontier
ways
would
ever
be
able
to
do
the
sergeant
and
i
have
concluded
on
the
matter
if
it
is
agreeable
to
you
as
he
thinks
is
likely
to
be
the
case
though
i
doubt
my
own
power
to
please
one
who
deserves
the
best
husband
america
can
mabel
countenance
changed
from
uneasiness
to
surprise
and
then
by
a
transition
still
quicker
from
surprise
to
pain
my
father
she
exclaimed
my
dear
father
has
thought
of
my
becoming
your
wife
pathfinder
yes
he
has
mabel
he
has
indeed
he
has
even
thought
such
a
thing
might
be
agreeable
to
you
and
has
almost
encouraged
me
to
fancy
it
might
be
but
you
yourself
you
certainly
can
care
nothing
whether
this
singular
expectation
shall
ever
be
realized
or
not
anan
i
mean
pathfinder
that
you
have
talked
of
this
match
more
to
oblige
my
father
than
anything
else
that
your
feelings
are
no
way
concerned
let
my
answer
be
what
it
may
the
scout
looked
earnestly
into
the
beautiful
face
of
mabel
which
had
flushed
with
the
ardor
and
novelty
of
her
sensations
and
it
was
not
possible
to
mistake
the
intense
admiration
that
betrayed
itself
in
every
lineament
of
his
ingenuous
countenance
i
have
often
thought
myself
happy
mabel
when
ranging
the
woods
on
a
successful
hunt
breathing
the
pure
air
of
the
hills
and
filled
with
vigor
and
health
but
i
now
know
that
it
has
all
been
idleness
and
vanity
compared
with
the
delight
it
would
give
me
to
know
that
you
thought
better
of
me
than
you
think
of
most
better
of
you
i
do
indeed
think
better
of
you
pathfinder
than
of
most
others
i
am
not
certain
that
i
do
not
think
better
of
you
than
of
any
other
for
your
truth
honesty
simplicity
justice
and
courage
are
scarcely
equalled
by
any
of
ah
mabel
these
are
sweet
and
encouraging
words
from
you
and
the
sergeant
after
all
was
not
so
near
wrong
as
i
nay
pathfinder
in
the
name
of
all
that
is
sacred
and
just
do
not
let
us
misunderstand
each
other
in
a
matter
of
so
much
importance
while
i
esteem
respect
nay
reverence
you
almost
as
much
as
i
reverence
my
own
dear
father
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
ever
become
your
wife
that
i
the
change
in
her
companion
countenance
was
so
sudden
and
so
great
that
the
moment
the
effect
of
what
she
had
uttered
became
visible
in
the
face
of
the
pathfinder
mabel
arrested
her
own
words
notwithstanding
her
strong
desire
to
be
explicit
the
reluctance
with
which
she
could
at
any
time
cause
pain
being
sufficient
of
itself
to
induce
the
pause
neither
spoke
for
some
time
the
shade
of
disappointment
that
crossed
the
rugged
lineaments
of
the
hunter
amounting
so
nearly
to
anguish
as
to
frighten
his
companion
while
the
sensation
of
choking
became
so
strong
in
the
pathfinder
that
he
fairly
griped
his
throat
like
one
who
sought
physical
relief
for
physical
suffering
the
convulsive
manner
in
which
his
fingers
worked
actually
struck
the
alarmed
girl
with
a
feeling
of
awe
nay
pathfinder
mabel
eagerly
added
the
instant
she
could
command
her
voice
i
may
have
said
more
than
i
mean
for
all
things
of
this
nature
are
possible
and
women
they
say
are
never
sure
of
their
own
minds
what
i
wish
you
to
understand
is
that
it
is
not
likely
that
you
and
i
should
ever
think
of
each
other
as
man
and
wife
ought
to
think
of
each
i
do
not
i
shall
never
think
in
that
way
again
mabel
gasped
forth
the
pathfinder
who
appeared
to
utter
his
words
like
one
just
raised
above
the
pressure
of
some
suffocating
substance
no
no
i
shall
never
think
of
you
or
any
one
else
again
in
that
pathfinder
dear
pathfinder
understand
me
do
not
attach
more
meaning
to
my
words
than
i
do
myself
a
match
like
that
would
be
unwise
unnatural
yes
natur
and
so
i
told
the
sergeant
but
he
have
it
pathfinder
oh
this
is
worse
than
i
could
have
imagined
take
my
hand
excellent
pathfinder
and
let
me
see
that
you
do
not
hate
me
for
sake
smile
upon
me
hate
you
mabel
smile
upon
you
ah
me
nay
give
me
your
hand
your
hardy
true
and
manly
hand
both
both
pathfinder
for
i
shall
not
be
easy
until
i
feel
certain
that
we
are
friends
again
and
that
all
this
has
been
a
mabel
said
the
guide
looking
wistfully
into
the
face
of
the
generous
and
impetuous
girl
as
she
held
his
two
hard
and
sunburnt
hands
in
her
own
pretty
and
delicate
fingers
and
laughing
in
his
own
silent
and
peculiar
manner
while
anguish
gleamed
over
lineaments
which
seemed
incapable
of
deception
even
while
agitated
with
emotions
so
conflicting
mabel
the
sergeant
was
the
feelings
could
endure
no
more
and
the
tears
rolled
down
the
cheeks
of
the
scout
like
rain
his
fingers
again
worked
convulsively
at
his
throat
and
his
breast
heaved
as
if
it
possessed
a
tenant
of
which
it
would
be
rid
by
any
effort
however
desperate
pathfinder
pathfinder
mabel
almost
shrieked
anything
but
this
anything
but
this
speak
to
me
pathfinder
smile
again
say
one
kind
word
anything
to
prove
you
can
forgive
the
sergeant
was
wrong
exclaimed
the
guide
laughing
amid
his
agony
in
a
way
to
terrify
his
companion
by
the
unnatural
mixture
of
anguish
and
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
and
said
it
yes
the
sergeant
was
wrong
after
we
can
be
friends
though
we
can
not
be
man
and
wife
continued
mabel
almost
as
much
disturbed
as
her
companion
scarcely
knowing
what
she
said
we
can
always
be
friends
and
always
i
thought
the
sergeant
was
mistaken
resumed
the
pathfinder
when
a
great
effort
had
enabled
him
to
command
himself
for
i
did
not
think
my
gifts
were
such
as
would
please
the
fancy
of
a
girl
it
would
have
been
better
mabel
had
he
not
me
into
a
different
notion
and
it
might
have
been
better
too
had
you
not
been
so
pleasant
and
confiding
like
yes
it
if
i
thought
any
error
of
mine
had
raised
false
expectations
in
you
pathfinder
however
unintentionally
on
my
part
i
should
never
forgive
myself
for
believe
me
i
would
rather
endure
pain
in
my
own
feelings
than
you
should
that
just
it
mabel
that
just
it
these
speeches
and
opinions
spoken
in
so
soft
a
voice
and
in
a
way
i
so
unused
to
in
the
woods
have
done
the
mischief
but
i
now
see
plainly
and
begin
to
understand
the
difference
between
us
better
and
will
strive
to
keep
down
thought
and
to
go
abroad
again
as
i
used
to
do
looking
for
the
game
and
the
inimy
ah
me
mabel
i
have
indeed
been
on
a
false
trail
since
we
in
a
little
while
you
will
forget
all
this
and
think
of
me
as
a
friend
who
owes
you
her
this
may
be
the
way
in
the
towns
but
i
doubt
if
it
to
the
woods
with
us
when
the
eye
sees
a
lovely
sight
it
is
apt
to
keep
it
long
in
view
or
when
the
mind
takes
in
an
upright
and
proper
feeling
it
is
loath
to
part
with
you
will
forget
it
all
when
you
come
seriously
to
recollect
that
i
am
altogether
unsuited
to
be
your
so
i
told
the
sergeant
but
he
would
have
it
otherwise
i
knew
you
was
too
young
and
beautiful
for
one
of
middle
age
like
myself
and
who
never
was
comely
to
look
at
even
in
youth
and
then
your
ways
have
not
been
my
ways
nor
would
a
hunter
cabin
be
a
fitting
place
for
one
who
was
edicated
among
chiefs
as
it
were
if
i
were
younger
and
comelier
though
like
jasper
never
mind
jasper
interrupted
mabel
impatiently
we
can
talk
of
something
jasper
is
a
worthy
lad
mabel
ay
and
a
comely
returned
the
guileless
guide
looking
earnestly
at
the
girl
as
if
he
distrusted
her
judgment
in
speaking
slightingly
of
his
friend
were
i
only
half
as
comely
as
jasper
western
my
misgivings
in
this
affair
would
not
have
been
so
great
and
they
might
not
have
been
so
we
will
not
talk
of
jasper
western
repeated
mabel
the
color
mounting
to
her
temples
he
may
be
good
enough
in
a
gale
or
on
the
lake
but
he
is
not
good
enough
to
talk
of
i
fear
me
mabel
he
is
better
than
the
man
who
is
likely
to
be
your
husband
though
the
sergeant
says
that
never
can
take
place
but
the
sergeant
was
wrong
once
and
he
may
be
wrong
and
who
is
likely
to
be
my
husband
pathfinder
this
is
scarcely
less
strange
than
what
has
just
passed
between
i
know
it
is
for
like
to
seek
like
and
for
them
that
have
consorted
much
with
officers
ladies
to
wish
to
be
officers
ladies
themselves
but
mabel
i
may
speak
plainly
to
you
i
know
and
i
hope
my
words
will
not
give
you
pain
for
now
i
understand
what
it
is
to
be
disappointed
in
such
feelings
i
would
wish
to
cause
even
a
mingo
sorrow
on
this
head
but
happiness
is
not
always
to
be
found
in
a
marquee
any
more
than
in
a
tent
and
though
the
officers
quarters
may
look
more
tempting
than
the
rest
of
the
barracks
there
is
often
great
misery
between
husband
and
wife
inside
of
their
i
do
not
doubt
it
in
the
least
pathfinder
and
did
it
rest
with
me
to
decide
i
would
sooner
follow
you
to
some
cabin
in
the
woods
and
share
your
fortune
whether
it
might
be
better
or
worse
than
go
inside
the
door
of
any
officer
i
know
with
an
intention
of
remaining
there
as
its
master
mabel
this
is
not
what
lundie
hopes
or
lundie
and
what
care
i
for
lundie
he
is
major
of
the
and
may
command
his
men
to
wheel
and
march
about
as
he
pleases
but
he
can
not
compel
me
to
wed
the
greatest
or
the
meanest
of
his
mess
besides
what
can
you
know
of
lundie
wishes
on
such
a
subject
from
lundie
own
mouth
the
sergeant
had
told
him
that
he
wished
me
for
a
and
the
major
being
an
old
and
a
true
friend
conversed
with
me
on
the
subject
he
put
it
to
me
plainly
whether
it
would
not
be
more
ginerous
in
me
to
let
an
officer
succeed
than
to
strive
to
make
you
share
a
hunter
fortune
i
owned
the
truth
i
did
and
that
was
that
i
thought
it
might
but
when
he
told
me
that
the
quartermaster
would
be
his
choice
i
would
not
abide
by
the
conditions
no
no
mabel
i
know
davy
muir
well
and
though
he
may
make
you
a
lady
he
can
never
make
you
a
happy
woman
or
himself
a
my
father
has
been
very
wrong
if
he
has
said
or
done
aught
to
cause
you
sorrow
pathfinder
and
so
great
is
my
respect
for
you
so
sincere
my
friendship
that
were
it
not
for
one
i
mean
that
no
person
need
fear
lieutenant
muir
influence
with
me
i
would
rather
remain
as
i
am
to
my
dying
day
than
become
a
lady
at
the
cost
of
being
his
i
do
not
think
you
would
say
that
which
you
do
not
feel
mabel
returned
pathfinder
earnestly
not
at
such
a
moment
on
such
a
subject
and
least
of
all
to
you
no
lieutenant
muir
may
find
wives
where
he
can
my
name
shall
never
be
on
his
thank
you
thank
you
for
that
mabel
for
though
there
is
no
longer
any
hope
for
me
i
could
never
be
happy
were
you
to
take
to
the
quartermaster
i
feared
the
commission
might
count
for
something
i
did
and
i
know
the
man
it
is
not
jealousy
that
makes
me
speak
in
this
manner
but
truth
for
i
know
the
man
now
were
you
to
fancy
a
desarving
youth
one
like
jasper
western
for
instance
why
always
mention
jasper
pathfinder
he
can
have
no
concern
with
our
friendship
let
us
talk
of
yourself
and
of
the
manner
in
which
you
intend
to
pass
the
ah
me
i
little
worth
at
the
best
mabel
unless
it
may
be
on
a
trail
or
with
the
rifle
and
less
worth
now
that
i
have
discovered
the
sergeant
mistake
there
is
no
need
therefore
of
talking
of
me
it
has
been
very
pleasant
to
me
to
be
near
you
so
long
and
even
to
fancy
that
the
sergeant
was
right
but
that
is
all
over
now
i
shall
go
down
the
lake
with
jasper
and
then
there
will
be
business
to
occupy
us
and
that
will
keep
useless
thoughts
out
of
the
and
you
will
forget
this
forget
me
no
not
forget
me
either
pathfinder
but
you
will
resume
your
old
pursuits
and
cease
to
think
a
girl
of
sufficient
importance
to
disturb
your
peace
i
never
knowed
it
afore
mabel
but
girls
are
of
more
account
in
this
life
than
i
could
have
believed
now
afore
i
knowed
you
the
babe
did
not
sleep
more
sweetly
than
i
used
my
head
was
no
sooner
on
the
root
or
the
stone
or
mayhap
on
the
skin
than
all
was
lost
to
the
senses
unless
it
might
be
to
go
over
in
the
night
the
business
of
the
day
in
a
dream
like
and
there
i
lay
till
the
moment
came
to
be
stirring
and
the
swallows
were
not
more
certain
to
be
on
the
wing
with
the
light
than
i
to
be
afoot
at
the
moment
i
wished
to
be
all
this
seemed
a
gift
and
might
be
calculated
on
even
in
the
midst
of
a
mingo
camp
for
i
been
outlying
in
my
time
in
the
very
villages
of
the
and
all
this
will
return
to
you
pathfinder
for
one
so
upright
and
sincere
will
never
waste
his
happiness
on
a
mere
fancy
you
will
dream
again
of
your
hunts
of
the
deer
you
have
slain
and
of
the
beaver
you
have
ah
me
mabel
i
wish
never
to
dream
again
before
we
met
i
had
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
following
up
the
hounds
in
fancy
as
it
might
be
and
even
in
striking
a
trail
of
the
iroquois
nay
i
been
in
skrimmages
and
ambushments
in
thought
like
and
found
satisfaction
in
it
according
to
my
gifts
but
all
those
things
have
lost
their
charms
since
i
made
acquaintance
with
you
now
i
think
no
longer
of
anything
rude
in
my
dreams
but
the
very
last
night
we
stayed
in
the
garrison
i
imagined
i
had
a
cabin
in
a
grove
of
sugar
maples
and
at
the
root
of
every
tree
was
a
mabel
dunham
while
the
birds
among
the
branches
sang
ballads
instead
of
the
notes
that
natur
gave
and
even
the
deer
stopped
to
listen
i
tried
to
shoot
a
but
killdeer
missed
fire
and
the
creatur
laughed
in
my
face
as
pleasantly
as
a
young
girl
laughs
in
her
merriment
and
then
it
bounded
away
looking
back
as
if
expecting
me
to
no
more
of
this
pathfinder
we
talk
no
more
of
these
things
said
mabel
dashing
the
tears
from
her
eyes
for
the
simple
earnest
manner
in
which
this
hardy
woodsman
betrayed
the
deep
hold
she
had
taken
of
his
feelings
nearly
proved
too
much
for
her
own
generous
heart
now
let
us
look
for
my
father
he
can
not
be
distant
as
i
heard
his
gun
quite
the
sergeant
was
wrong
yes
he
was
wrong
and
it
of
no
avail
to
attempt
to
make
the
dove
consort
with
the
here
comes
my
dear
father
interrupted
mabel
let
us
look
cheerful
and
happy
pathfinder
as
such
good
friends
ought
to
look
and
keep
each
other
a
pause
succeeded
the
sergeant
foot
was
heard
crushing
the
dried
twigs
hard
by
and
then
his
form
appeared
shoving
aside
the
bushes
of
a
copse
just
near
as
he
issued
into
the
open
ground
the
old
soldier
scrutinized
his
daughter
and
her
companion
and
speaking
he
said
mabel
child
you
are
young
and
light
of
foot
look
for
a
bird
that
i
shot
that
fell
just
beyond
the
thicket
of
young
hemlocks
on
the
shore
and
as
jasper
is
showing
signs
of
an
intention
of
getting
under
way
you
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
clamber
up
this
hill
again
but
we
will
meet
you
on
the
beach
in
a
few
mabel
obeyed
bounding
down
the
hill
with
the
elastic
step
of
youth
and
health
but
notwithstanding
the
lightness
of
her
steps
the
heart
of
the
girl
was
heavy
and
no
sooner
was
she
hid
from
observation
by
the
thicket
than
she
threw
herself
on
the
root
of
a
tree
and
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
the
sergeant
watched
her
until
she
disappeared
with
a
father
pride
and
then
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
smile
as
kind
and
as
familiar
as
his
habits
would
allow
him
to
use
towards
any
she
has
her
mother
lightness
and
activity
my
friend
with
somewhat
of
her
father
force
said
he
her
mother
was
not
quite
so
handsome
i
think
myself
but
the
dunhams
were
always
thought
comely
whether
men
or
women
well
pathfinder
i
take
it
for
granted
you
not
overlooked
the
opportunity
but
have
spoken
plainly
to
the
girl
women
like
frankness
in
matters
of
this
i
believe
mabel
and
i
understand
each
other
at
last
sergeant
returned
the
other
looking
another
way
to
avoid
the
soldier
face
so
much
the
better
some
people
fancy
that
a
little
doubt
and
uncertainty
makes
love
all
the
livelier
but
i
am
one
of
those
who
think
the
plainer
the
tongue
speaks
the
easier
the
mind
will
comprehend
was
mabel
surprised
i
fear
she
was
sergeant
i
fear
she
was
taken
quite
by
surprise
yes
i
well
well
surprises
in
love
are
like
an
ambush
in
war
and
quite
as
lawful
though
it
is
not
so
easy
to
tell
when
a
woman
is
surprised
as
to
tell
when
it
happens
to
an
enemy
mabel
did
not
run
away
my
worthy
friend
did
she
no
sergeant
mabel
did
not
try
to
escape
i
can
say
with
a
clear
i
hope
the
girl
was
too
willing
neither
her
mother
was
shy
and
coy
for
a
month
at
least
but
frankness
after
all
is
a
recommendation
in
a
man
or
that
it
is
that
it
is
and
judgment
you
are
not
to
look
for
too
much
judgment
in
a
young
creature
of
twenty
pathfinder
but
it
will
come
with
experience
a
mistake
in
you
or
me
for
instance
might
not
be
so
easily
overlooked
but
in
a
girl
of
mabel
years
one
is
not
to
strain
at
a
gnat
lest
they
swallow
a
the
reader
will
remember
that
sergeant
dunham
was
not
a
hebrew
scholar
the
muscles
of
the
listener
face
twitched
as
the
sergeant
was
thus
delivering
his
sentiments
though
the
former
had
now
recovered
a
portion
of
that
stoicism
which
formed
so
large
a
part
of
his
character
and
which
he
had
probably
imbibed
from
long
association
with
the
indians
his
eyes
rose
and
fell
and
once
a
gleam
shot
athwart
his
hard
features
as
if
he
were
about
to
indulge
in
his
peculiar
laugh
but
the
joyous
feeling
if
it
really
existed
was
as
quickly
lost
in
a
look
allied
to
anguish
it
was
this
unusual
mixture
of
wild
and
keen
mental
agony
with
native
simple
joyousness
which
had
most
struck
mabel
who
in
the
interview
just
related
had
a
dozen
times
been
on
the
point
of
believing
that
her
suitor
heart
was
only
lightly
touched
as
images
of
happiness
and
humor
gleamed
over
a
mind
that
was
almost
infantile
in
its
simplicity
and
nature
an
impression
however
which
was
soon
driven
away
by
the
discovery
of
emotions
so
painful
and
so
deep
that
they
seemed
to
harrow
the
very
soul
you
say
true
sergeant
pathfinder
answered
a
mistake
in
one
like
you
is
a
more
serious
you
will
find
mabel
sincere
and
honest
in
the
end
give
her
but
a
little
ah
me
sergeant
a
man
of
your
merits
would
make
an
impression
on
a
rock
give
him
time
sergeant
dunham
we
are
old
that
is
as
campaigns
are
carried
on
here
in
the
wilderness
and
we
have
done
so
many
kind
acts
to
each
other
that
we
can
afford
to
be
candid
what
has
caused
you
to
believe
that
a
girl
like
mabel
could
ever
fancy
one
so
rude
as
i
am
what
why
a
variety
of
reasons
and
good
reasons
too
my
friend
those
same
acts
of
kindness
perhaps
and
the
campaigns
you
mention
moreover
you
are
my
sworn
and
tried
all
this
sounds
well
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
consarned
but
they
do
not
touch
the
case
of
your
pretty
daughter
she
may
think
these
very
campaigns
have
destroyed
the
little
comeliness
i
may
once
have
had
and
i
am
not
quite
sartain
that
being
an
old
friend
of
her
father
would
lead
any
young
maiden
mind
into
a
particular
affection
for
a
suitor
like
loves
like
i
tell
you
sergeant
and
my
gifts
are
not
altogether
the
gifts
of
mabel
these
are
some
of
your
old
modest
qualms
pathfinder
and
will
do
you
no
credit
with
the
girl
women
distrust
men
who
distrust
themselves
and
take
to
men
who
distrust
nothing
modesty
is
a
capital
thing
in
a
recruit
i
grant
you
or
in
a
young
subaltern
who
has
just
joined
for
it
prevents
his
railing
at
the
officers
before
he
knows
what
to
rail
at
i
not
sure
it
is
out
of
place
in
a
commissary
or
a
parson
but
it
the
devil
and
all
when
it
gets
possession
of
a
real
soldier
or
a
lover
have
as
little
to
do
with
it
as
possible
if
you
would
win
a
woman
heart
as
for
your
doctrine
that
like
loves
like
it
is
as
wrong
as
possible
in
matters
of
this
sort
if
like
loved
like
women
would
love
one
another
and
men
also
no
no
like
loves
dislike
the
sergeant
was
merely
a
scholar
of
the
camp
and
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
mabel
on
that
score
look
at
lieutenant
muir
the
man
has
had
five
wives
already
they
tell
me
and
there
is
no
more
modesty
in
him
than
there
is
in
a
lieutenant
muir
will
never
be
the
husband
of
mabel
dunham
let
him
ruffle
his
feathers
as
much
as
he
that
is
a
sensible
remark
of
yours
pathfinder
for
my
mind
is
made
up
that
you
shall
be
my
if
i
were
an
officer
myself
muir
might
have
some
chance
but
time
has
placed
one
door
between
my
child
and
myself
and
i
do
intend
there
shall
be
that
of
a
marquee
sergeant
we
must
let
mabel
follow
her
own
fancy
she
is
young
and
light
of
heart
and
god
forbid
that
any
wish
of
mine
should
lay
the
weight
of
a
feather
on
a
mind
that
is
all
gaiety
now
or
take
one
note
of
happiness
from
her
laughter
have
you
conversed
freely
with
the
girl
the
sergeant
demanded
quickly
and
with
some
asperity
of
manner
pathfinder
was
too
honest
to
deny
a
truth
plain
as
that
which
the
answer
required
and
yet
too
honorable
to
betray
mabel
and
expose
her
to
the
resentment
of
one
whom
he
well
knew
to
be
stern
in
his
anger
we
have
laid
open
our
minds
he
said
and
though
mabel
is
one
that
any
man
might
love
to
look
at
i
find
little
there
sergeant
to
make
me
think
any
better
of
the
girl
has
not
dared
to
refuse
you
to
refuse
her
father
best
friend
pathfinder
turned
his
face
away
to
conceal
the
look
of
anguish
that
consciousness
told
him
was
passing
athwart
it
but
he
continued
the
discourse
in
his
own
quiet
manly
tones
mabel
is
too
kind
to
refuse
anything
or
to
utter
harsh
words
to
a
dog
i
have
not
put
the
question
in
a
way
to
be
downright
refused
and
did
you
expect
my
daughter
to
jump
into
your
arms
before
you
asked
her
she
would
not
have
been
her
mother
child
had
she
done
any
such
thing
nor
do
i
think
she
would
have
been
mine
the
dunhams
like
plain
dealing
as
well
as
the
king
majesty
but
they
are
no
jumpers
leave
me
to
manage
this
matter
for
you
pathfinder
and
there
shall
be
no
unnecessary
delay
i
speak
to
mabel
myself
this
very
evening
using
your
name
as
principal
in
the
i
rather
not
i
rather
not
sergeant
leave
the
matter
to
mabel
and
me
and
i
think
all
will
come
right
in
the
ind
young
girls
are
like
timorsome
birds
they
do
not
being
hurried
or
spoken
harshly
to
nither
leave
the
matter
to
mabel
and
on
one
condition
i
will
my
friend
and
that
is
that
you
will
promise
me
on
the
honor
of
a
scout
that
you
will
put
the
matter
plainly
to
mabel
the
first
suitable
opportunity
and
no
mincing
of
i
will
ask
her
sergeant
on
condition
that
you
promise
not
to
meddle
in
the
affair
yes
i
will
promise
to
ask
mabel
whether
she
will
marry
me
even
though
she
laugh
in
my
face
at
my
doing
so
on
that
sergeant
dunham
gave
the
desired
promise
very
cheerfully
for
he
had
completely
wrought
himself
up
into
the
belief
that
the
man
he
so
much
esteemed
himself
must
be
acceptable
to
his
daughter
he
had
married
a
woman
much
younger
than
himself
and
he
saw
no
unfitness
in
the
respective
years
of
the
intended
couple
mabel
was
educated
so
much
above
him
too
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
difference
which
actually
existed
between
the
parent
and
child
in
this
respect
it
followed
that
sergeant
dunham
was
not
altogether
qualified
to
appreciate
his
daughter
tastes
or
to
form
a
very
probable
conjecture
what
would
be
the
direction
taken
by
those
feelings
which
oftener
depend
on
impulses
and
passion
than
on
reason
still
the
worthy
soldier
was
not
so
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
the
pathfinder
chances
as
might
at
first
appear
knowing
all
the
sterling
qualities
of
the
man
his
truth
integrity
of
purpose
courage
disinterestedness
it
was
far
from
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
qualities
like
these
would
produce
a
deep
impression
on
any
female
heart
and
the
father
erred
principally
in
fancying
that
the
daughter
might
know
as
it
might
be
by
intuition
what
he
himself
had
acquired
by
years
of
intercourse
and
adventure
as
pathfinder
and
his
military
friend
descended
the
hill
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
discourse
did
not
flag
the
latter
continued
to
persuade
the
former
that
his
diffidence
alone
prevented
complete
success
with
mabel
and
that
he
had
only
to
persevere
in
order
to
prevail
pathfinder
was
much
too
modest
by
nature
and
had
been
too
plainly
though
so
delicately
discouraged
in
the
recent
interview
to
believe
all
he
heard
still
the
father
used
so
many
arguments
which
seemed
plausible
and
it
was
so
grateful
to
fancy
that
the
daughter
might
yet
be
his
that
the
reader
is
not
to
be
surprised
when
he
is
told
that
this
unsophisticated
being
did
not
view
mabel
recent
conduct
in
precisely
the
light
in
which
he
may
be
inclined
to
view
it
himself
he
did
not
credit
all
that
the
sergeant
told
him
it
is
true
but
he
began
to
think
virgin
coyness
and
ignorance
of
her
own
feelings
might
have
induced
mabel
to
use
the
language
she
had
the
quartermaster
is
no
favorite
said
pathfinder
in
answer
to
one
of
his
companion
remarks
mabel
will
never
look
on
him
as
more
than
one
who
has
had
four
or
five
wives
which
is
more
than
his
share
a
man
may
marry
twice
without
offence
to
good
morals
and
decency
i
allow
but
four
times
is
an
i
should
think
even
marrying
once
what
master
cap
calls
a
circumstance
put
in
pathfinder
laughing
in
his
quiet
way
for
by
this
time
his
spirits
had
recovered
some
of
their
buoyancy
it
is
indeed
my
friend
and
a
most
solemn
circumstance
too
if
it
were
not
that
mabel
is
to
be
your
wife
i
would
advise
you
to
remain
single
but
here
is
the
girl
herself
and
discretion
is
the
ah
me
sergeant
i
fear
you
are
mistaken
chapter
xix
thus
was
this
place
a
happy
rural
seat
of
various
view
milton
mabel
was
in
waiting
on
the
beach
and
the
canoe
was
soon
launched
pathfinder
carried
the
party
out
through
the
surf
in
the
same
skillful
manner
that
he
had
brought
it
in
and
though
mabel
color
heightened
with
excitement
and
her
heart
seemed
often
ready
to
leap
out
of
her
mouth
again
they
reached
the
side
of
the
without
having
received
even
a
drop
of
spray
ontario
is
like
a
man
sudden
to
be
angered
and
as
soon
appeased
the
sea
had
already
fallen
and
though
the
breakers
bounded
the
shore
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
was
merely
in
lines
of
brightness
that
appeared
and
vanished
like
the
returning
waves
produced
by
a
stone
which
had
been
dropped
into
a
pool
the
cable
of
the
was
scarcely
seen
above
the
water
and
jasper
had
already
hoisted
his
sails
in
readiness
to
depart
as
soon
as
the
expected
breeze
from
the
shore
should
fill
the
canvas
it
was
just
sunset
as
the
cutter
mainsail
flapped
and
its
stem
began
to
sever
the
water
the
air
was
light
and
southerly
and
the
head
of
the
vessel
was
kept
looking
up
along
the
south
shore
it
being
the
intention
to
get
to
the
eastward
again
as
fast
as
possible
the
night
that
succeeded
was
quiet
and
the
rest
of
those
who
slept
deep
and
tranquil
some
difficulty
occurred
concerning
the
command
of
the
vessel
but
the
matter
had
been
finally
settled
by
an
amicable
compromise
as
the
distrust
of
jasper
was
far
from
being
appeased
cap
retained
a
supervisory
power
while
the
young
man
was
allowed
to
work
the
craft
subject
at
all
times
to
the
control
and
interference
of
the
old
seaman
to
this
jasper
consented
in
preference
to
exposing
mabel
any
longer
to
the
dangers
of
their
present
situation
for
now
that
the
violence
of
the
elements
had
ceased
he
well
knew
that
the
would
be
in
search
of
them
he
had
the
discretion
however
not
to
reveal
his
apprehensions
on
this
head
for
it
happened
that
the
very
means
he
deemed
the
best
to
escape
the
enemy
were
those
which
would
be
most
likely
to
awaken
new
suspicions
of
his
honesty
in
the
minds
of
those
who
held
the
power
to
defeat
his
intentions
in
other
words
jasper
believed
that
the
gallant
young
frenchman
who
commanded
the
ship
of
the
enemy
would
quit
his
anchorage
under
the
fort
at
niagara
and
stand
up
the
lake
as
soon
as
the
wind
abated
in
order
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
the
keeping
midway
between
the
two
shores
as
the
best
means
of
commanding
a
broad
view
and
that
on
his
part
it
would
be
expedient
to
hug
one
coast
or
the
other
not
only
to
avoid
a
meeting
but
as
affording
a
chance
of
passing
without
detection
by
blending
his
sails
and
spars
with
objects
on
the
land
he
preferred
the
south
because
it
was
the
weather
shore
and
because
he
thought
it
was
that
which
the
enemy
would
the
least
expect
him
to
take
though
it
necessarily
led
near
his
settlements
and
in
front
of
one
of
the
strongest
posts
he
held
in
that
part
of
the
world
of
all
this
however
cap
was
happily
ignorant
and
the
sergeant
mind
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
details
of
his
military
trust
to
enter
into
these
niceties
which
so
properly
belonged
to
another
profession
no
opposition
was
made
therefore
and
before
morning
jasper
had
apparently
dropped
quietly
into
all
his
former
authority
issuing
his
orders
freely
and
meeting
with
obedience
without
hesitation
or
cavil
the
appearance
of
day
brought
all
on
board
on
deck
again
and
as
is
usual
with
adventurers
on
the
water
the
opening
horizon
was
curiously
examined
as
objects
started
out
of
the
obscurity
and
the
panorama
brightened
under
the
growing
light
east
west
and
north
nothing
was
visible
but
water
glittering
in
the
rising
sun
but
southward
stretched
the
endless
belt
of
woods
that
then
held
ontario
in
a
setting
of
forest
verdure
suddenly
an
opening
appeared
ahead
and
then
the
massive
walls
of
a
house
with
outworks
bastions
blockhouses
and
palisadoes
frowned
on
a
headland
that
bordered
the
outlet
of
a
broad
stream
just
as
the
fort
became
visible
a
little
cloud
rose
over
it
and
the
white
ensign
of
france
was
seen
fluttering
from
a
lofty
flagstaff
cap
gave
an
ejaculation
as
he
witnessed
this
ungrateful
exhibition
and
he
cast
a
quick
suspicious
glance
at
his
the
dirty
tablecloth
hung
up
to
air
as
my
name
is
charles
cap
he
muttered
and
we
hugging
this
d
d
shore
as
if
it
were
our
wife
and
children
met
on
the
return
from
an
india
jasper
are
you
in
search
of
a
cargo
of
frogs
that
you
keep
so
near
in
to
this
new
france
i
hug
the
land
sir
in
the
hope
of
passing
the
enemy
ship
without
being
seen
for
i
think
she
must
be
somewhere
down
here
to
ay
ay
this
sounds
well
and
i
hope
it
may
turn
out
as
you
say
i
trust
there
is
no
here
we
are
on
a
weather
shore
now
said
jasper
smiling
and
i
think
you
will
admit
master
cap
that
a
strong
makes
an
easy
cable
we
owe
all
our
lives
to
the
of
this
very
french
flummery
growled
cap
though
he
did
not
care
to
be
heard
by
jasper
give
me
a
fair
honest
tow
above
board
and
above
water
too
if
i
must
have
a
tow
at
all
and
none
of
your
sneaking
drift
that
is
below
the
surface
where
one
can
neither
see
nor
feel
i
daresay
if
the
truth
could
be
come
at
that
this
late
escape
of
ours
was
all
a
contrived
we
have
now
a
good
opportunity
at
least
to
reconnoitre
the
post
at
niagara
brother
for
such
i
take
this
fort
to
be
put
in
the
sergeant
let
us
be
all
eyes
in
passing
and
remember
that
we
are
almost
in
face
of
the
this
advice
of
the
sergeant
needed
nothing
to
enforce
it
for
the
interest
and
novelty
of
passing
a
spot
occupied
by
human
beings
were
of
themselves
sufficient
to
attract
deep
attention
in
that
scene
of
a
vast
but
deserted
nature
the
wind
was
now
fresh
enough
to
urge
the
through
the
water
with
considerable
velocity
and
jasper
eased
her
helm
as
she
opened
the
river
and
luffed
nearly
into
the
mouth
of
that
noble
strait
or
river
as
it
is
termed
a
dull
distant
heavy
roar
came
down
through
the
opening
in
the
banks
swelling
on
the
currents
of
the
air
like
the
deeper
notes
of
some
immense
organ
and
occasionally
seeming
to
cause
the
earth
itself
to
tremble
that
sounds
like
surf
on
some
long
unbroken
coast
exclaimed
cap
as
a
swell
deeper
than
common
came
to
his
ears
ay
that
is
such
surf
as
we
have
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
pathfinder
answered
there
is
no
there
master
cap
but
all
the
water
that
strikes
the
rocks
stays
there
so
far
as
going
back
again
is
consarned
that
is
old
niagara
that
you
hear
or
this
noble
stream
tumbling
down
a
no
one
will
have
the
impudence
to
pretend
that
this
fine
broad
river
falls
over
yonder
hills
it
does
master
cap
it
does
and
all
for
the
want
of
stairs
or
a
road
to
come
down
by
this
is
natur
as
we
have
it
up
hereaway
though
i
daresay
you
beat
us
down
on
the
ocean
ah
me
mabel
a
pleasant
hour
it
would
be
if
we
could
walk
on
the
shore
some
ten
or
fifteen
miles
up
this
stream
and
gaze
on
all
that
god
has
done
you
have
then
seen
these
renowned
falls
pathfinder
the
girl
eagerly
inquired
i
have
yes
i
have
and
an
awful
sight
i
witnessed
at
that
same
time
the
sarpent
and
i
were
out
scouting
about
the
garrison
there
when
he
told
me
that
the
traditions
of
his
people
gave
an
account
of
a
mighty
cataract
in
this
neighborhood
and
he
asked
me
to
vary
from
the
line
of
march
a
little
to
look
at
the
wonder
i
had
heard
some
marvels
consarning
the
spot
from
the
soldiers
of
the
which
is
my
corps
like
and
not
the
with
which
i
have
sojourned
so
much
of
late
but
there
are
so
many
terrible
liars
in
all
rijiments
that
i
hardly
believed
half
they
had
told
me
well
we
went
and
though
we
expected
to
be
led
by
our
ears
and
to
hear
some
of
that
awful
roaring
that
we
hear
we
were
disappointed
for
natur
was
not
then
speaking
in
thunder
as
she
is
this
morning
thus
it
is
in
the
forest
master
cap
there
being
moments
when
god
seems
to
be
walking
abroad
in
power
and
then
again
there
is
a
calm
over
all
as
if
his
spirit
lay
in
quiet
along
the
well
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
stream
a
short
distance
above
the
fall
and
a
young
delaware
who
was
in
our
company
found
a
bark
canoe
and
he
would
push
into
the
current
to
reach
an
island
that
lies
in
the
very
centre
of
the
confusion
and
strife
we
told
him
of
his
folly
we
did
and
we
reasoned
with
him
on
the
wickedness
of
tempting
providence
by
seeking
danger
that
led
to
no
ind
but
the
youth
among
the
delawares
are
very
much
the
same
as
the
youth
among
the
soldiers
risky
and
vain
all
we
could
say
did
not
change
his
mind
and
the
lad
had
his
way
to
me
it
seems
mabel
that
whenever
a
thing
is
really
grand
and
potent
it
has
a
quiet
majesty
about
it
altogether
unlike
the
frothy
and
flustering
manner
of
smaller
matters
and
so
it
was
with
them
rapids
the
canoe
was
no
sooner
fairly
in
them
than
down
it
went
as
it
might
be
as
one
sails
through
the
air
on
the
and
no
skill
of
the
young
delaware
could
resist
the
stream
and
yet
he
struggled
manfully
for
life
using
the
paddle
to
the
last
like
the
deer
that
is
swimming
to
cast
the
hounds
at
first
he
shot
across
the
current
so
swiftly
that
we
thought
he
would
prevail
but
he
had
miscalculated
his
distance
and
when
the
truth
really
struck
him
he
turned
the
head
upstream
and
struggled
in
a
way
that
was
fearful
to
look
at
i
could
have
pitied
him
even
had
he
been
a
mingo
for
a
few
moments
his
efforts
were
so
frantic
that
he
actually
prevailed
over
the
power
of
the
cataract
but
natur
has
its
limits
and
one
faltering
stroke
of
the
paddle
set
him
back
and
then
he
lost
ground
foot
by
foot
inch
by
inch
until
he
got
near
the
spot
where
the
river
looked
even
and
green
and
as
if
it
were
made
of
millions
of
threads
of
water
all
bent
over
some
huge
rock
when
he
shot
backwards
like
an
arrow
and
disappeared
the
bow
of
the
canoe
tipping
just
enough
to
let
us
see
what
had
become
of
him
i
met
a
mohawk
some
years
later
who
had
witnessed
the
whole
affair
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
below
and
he
told
me
that
the
delaware
continued
to
paddle
in
the
air
until
he
was
lost
in
the
mists
of
the
and
what
became
of
the
poor
wretch
demanded
mabel
who
had
been
strongly
interested
by
the
natural
eloquence
of
the
speaker
he
went
to
the
happy
of
his
people
no
doubt
for
though
he
was
risky
and
vain
he
was
also
just
and
brave
yes
he
died
foolishly
but
the
manitou
of
the
has
compassion
on
his
creatur
as
well
as
the
god
of
a
a
gun
at
this
moment
was
discharged
from
a
blockhouse
near
the
fort
and
the
shot
one
of
light
weight
came
whistling
over
the
cutter
mast
an
admonition
to
approach
no
nearer
jasper
was
at
the
helm
and
he
kept
away
smiling
at
the
same
time
as
if
he
felt
no
anger
at
the
rudeness
of
the
salutation
the
was
now
in
the
current
and
her
outward
set
soon
carried
her
far
enough
to
leeward
to
avoid
the
danger
of
a
repetition
of
the
shot
and
then
she
quietly
continued
her
course
along
the
land
as
soon
as
the
river
was
fairly
opened
jasper
ascertained
that
the
was
not
at
anchor
in
it
and
a
man
sent
aloft
came
down
with
the
report
that
the
horizon
showed
no
sail
the
hope
was
now
strong
that
the
artifice
of
jasper
had
succeeded
and
that
the
french
commander
had
missed
them
by
keeping
the
middle
of
the
lake
as
he
steered
towards
its
head
all
that
day
the
wind
hung
to
the
southward
and
the
cutter
continued
her
course
about
a
league
from
the
land
running
six
or
eight
knots
the
hour
in
perfectly
smooth
water
although
the
scene
had
one
feature
of
monotony
the
outline
of
unbroken
forest
it
was
not
without
its
interest
and
pleasures
various
headlands
presented
themselves
and
the
cutter
in
running
from
one
to
another
stretched
across
bays
so
deep
as
almost
to
deserve
the
name
of
gulfs
but
nowhere
did
the
eye
meet
with
the
evidences
of
civilization
rivers
occasionally
poured
their
tribute
into
the
great
reservoir
of
the
lake
but
their
banks
could
be
traced
inland
for
miles
by
the
same
outlines
of
trees
and
even
large
bays
that
lay
embosomed
in
woods
communicating
with
ontario
only
by
narrow
outlets
appeared
and
disappeared
without
bringing
with
them
a
single
trace
of
a
human
habitation
of
all
on
board
the
pathfinder
viewed
the
scene
with
the
most
unmingled
delight
his
eyes
feasted
on
the
endless
line
of
forest
and
more
than
once
that
day
notwithstanding
he
found
it
so
grateful
to
be
near
mabel
listening
to
her
pleasant
voice
and
echoing
in
feelings
at
least
her
joyous
laugh
did
his
soul
pine
to
be
wandering
beneath
the
high
arches
of
the
maples
oaks
and
lindens
where
his
habits
had
induced
him
to
fancy
lasting
and
true
joys
were
only
to
be
found
cap
viewed
the
prospect
differently
more
than
once
he
expressed
his
disgust
at
there
being
no
lighthouses
beacons
or
roadsteads
with
their
shipping
such
another
coast
he
protested
the
world
did
not
contain
and
taking
the
sergeant
aside
he
gravely
assured
him
that
the
region
could
never
come
to
anything
as
the
havens
were
neglected
the
rivers
had
a
deserted
and
useless
look
and
that
even
the
breeze
had
a
smell
of
the
forest
about
it
which
spoke
ill
of
its
properties
but
the
humors
of
the
different
individuals
in
her
did
not
stay
the
speed
of
the
when
the
sun
was
setting
she
was
already
a
hundred
miles
on
her
route
towards
oswego
into
which
river
sergeant
dunham
now
thought
it
his
duty
to
go
in
order
to
receive
any
communications
that
major
duncan
might
please
to
make
with
a
view
to
effect
this
purpose
jasper
continued
to
hug
the
shore
all
night
and
though
the
wind
began
to
fail
him
towards
morning
it
lasted
long
enough
to
carry
the
cutter
up
to
a
point
that
was
known
to
be
but
a
league
or
two
from
the
fort
here
the
breeze
came
out
light
at
the
northward
and
the
cutter
hauled
a
little
from
the
land
in
order
to
obtain
a
safe
offing
should
it
come
on
to
blow
or
should
the
weather
again
get
to
be
easterly
when
the
day
dawned
the
cutter
had
the
mouth
of
the
oswego
well
under
the
lee
distant
about
two
miles
and
just
as
the
morning
gun
from
the
fort
was
fired
jasper
gave
the
order
to
ease
off
the
sheets
and
to
bear
up
for
his
port
at
that
moment
a
cry
from
the
forecastle
drew
all
eyes
towards
the
point
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
outlet
and
there
just
without
the
range
of
shot
from
the
light
guns
of
the
works
with
her
canvas
reduced
to
barely
enough
to
keep
her
stationary
lay
the
evidently
in
waiting
for
their
appearance
to
pass
her
was
impossible
for
by
filling
her
sails
the
french
ship
could
have
intercepted
them
in
a
few
minutes
and
the
circumstances
called
for
a
prompt
decision
after
a
short
consultation
the
sergeant
again
changed
his
plan
determining
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
towards
the
station
for
which
he
had
been
originally
destined
trusting
to
the
speed
of
the
to
throw
the
enemy
so
far
astern
as
to
leave
no
clue
to
her
movements
the
cutter
accordingly
hauled
upon
a
wind
with
the
least
possible
delay
with
everything
set
that
would
draw
guns
were
fired
from
the
fort
ensigns
shown
and
the
ramparts
were
again
crowded
but
sympathy
was
all
the
aid
that
lundie
could
lend
to
his
party
and
the
also
firing
four
or
five
guns
of
defiance
and
throwing
abroad
several
of
the
banners
of
france
was
soon
in
chase
under
a
cloud
of
canvas
for
several
hours
the
two
vessels
were
pressing
through
the
water
as
fast
as
possible
making
short
stretches
to
windward
apparently
with
a
view
to
keep
the
port
under
their
lee
the
one
to
enter
it
if
possible
and
the
other
to
intercept
it
in
the
attempt
at
meridian
the
french
ship
was
hull
down
dead
to
leeward
the
disparity
of
sailing
on
a
wind
being
very
great
and
some
islands
were
near
by
behind
which
jasper
said
it
would
be
possible
for
the
cutter
to
conceal
her
future
movements
although
cap
and
the
sergeant
and
particularly
lieutenant
muir
to
judge
by
his
language
still
felt
a
good
deal
of
distrust
of
the
young
man
and
frontenac
was
not
distant
this
advice
was
followed
for
time
pressed
and
the
quartermaster
discreetly
observed
that
jasper
could
not
well
betray
them
without
running
openly
into
the
enemy
harbor
a
step
they
could
at
any
time
prevent
since
the
only
cruiser
of
force
the
french
possessed
at
the
moment
was
under
their
lee
and
not
in
a
situation
to
do
them
any
immediate
injury
left
to
himself
jasper
western
soon
proved
how
much
was
really
in
him
he
weathered
upon
the
islands
passed
them
and
on
coming
out
to
the
eastward
kept
broad
away
with
nothing
in
sight
in
his
wake
or
to
leeward
by
sunset
again
the
cutter
was
up
with
the
first
of
the
islands
that
lie
in
the
outlet
of
the
lake
and
ere
it
was
dark
she
was
running
through
the
narrow
channels
on
her
way
to
the
station
at
nine
however
cap
insisted
that
they
should
anchor
for
the
maze
of
islands
became
so
complicated
and
obscure
that
he
feared
at
every
opening
the
party
would
find
themselves
under
the
guns
of
a
french
fort
jasper
consented
cheerfully
it
being
a
part
of
his
standing
instructions
to
approach
the
station
under
such
circumstances
as
would
prevent
the
men
from
obtaining
any
very
accurate
notions
of
its
position
lest
a
deserter
might
betray
the
little
garrison
to
the
enemy
the
was
brought
to
in
a
small
retired
bay
where
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
find
her
by
daylight
and
where
she
was
perfectly
concealed
at
night
when
all
but
a
solitary
sentinel
on
deck
sought
their
rest
cap
had
been
so
harassed
during
the
previous
hours
that
his
slumbers
were
long
and
deep
nor
did
he
awake
from
his
first
nap
until
the
day
was
just
beginning
to
dawn
his
eyes
were
scarcely
open
however
when
his
nautical
instinct
told
him
that
the
cutter
was
under
way
springing
up
he
found
the
threading
the
islands
again
with
no
one
on
deck
but
jasper
and
the
pilot
unless
the
sentinel
be
excepted
who
had
not
in
the
least
interfered
with
movements
that
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
were
as
regular
as
they
were
necessary
how
this
master
western
demanded
cap
with
sufficient
fierceness
for
the
occasion
are
you
running
us
into
frontenac
at
last
and
we
all
asleep
below
like
so
many
mariners
waiting
for
the
go
this
is
according
to
orders
master
cap
major
duncan
having
commanded
me
never
to
approach
the
station
unless
at
a
moment
when
the
people
were
below
for
he
does
not
wish
there
should
be
more
pilots
in
those
waters
than
the
king
has
need
a
pretty
job
i
should
have
made
of
running
down
among
these
bushes
and
rocks
with
no
one
on
deck
why
a
regular
york
branch
could
make
nothing
of
such
a
i
always
thought
sir
said
jasper
smiling
you
would
have
done
better
had
you
left
the
cutter
in
my
hands

she
had
safely
reached
her
place

we
should
have
done
it

we
should
have
done
it
had
it
not
been
for
a
circumstance
these
circumstances
are
serious
matters
and
no
prudent
man
will
overlook
well
sir
i
hope
there
is
now
an
end
of
them
we
shall
arrive
in
less
than
an
hour
if
the
wind
holds
and
then
you
be
safe
from
any
circumstances
that
i
can
humph
cap
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
and
as
everything
around
him
had
the
appearance
of
jasper
being
sincere
there
was
not
much
difficulty
in
making
up
his
mind
to
submit
it
would
not
have
been
easy
indeed
for
a
person
the
most
sensitive
on
the
subject
of
circumstances
to
fancy
that
the
was
anywhere
in
the
vicinity
of
a
port
so
long
established
and
so
well
known
on
the
frontiers
as
frontenac
the
islands
might
not
have
been
literally
a
thousand
in
number
but
they
were
so
numerous
and
small
as
to
baffle
calculation
though
occasionally
one
of
larger
size
than
common
was
passed
jasper
had
quitted
what
might
have
been
termed
the
main
channel
and
was
winding
his
way
with
a
good
stiff
breeze
and
a
favorable
current
through
passes
that
were
sometimes
so
narrow
that
there
appeared
to
be
barely
room
sufficient
for
the
spars
to
clear
the
trees
while
at
other
moments
he
shot
across
little
bays
and
buried
the
cutter
again
amid
rocks
forests
and
bushes
the
water
was
so
transparent
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
lead
and
being
of
very
equal
depth
little
risk
was
actually
run
though
cap
with
his
maritime
habits
was
in
a
constant
fever
lest
they
should

the
perfection

never

was

satisfaction

up
on
the

with
a
delight
which
she
did
not
care
to
express
and
her
father
led
his
men
after
her
with
an
alacrity
which
proved
how
wearied
he
had
become
of

the
place
was
familiarly
termed

the
soldiers

indeed
a
spot
to

by

troops
for
their
purpose

small
containing
about
twenty
acres
of
land
and
by
some
of
the
accidents
of
the
wilderness
it
had
been
partly
stripped
of
its
trees
probably
centuries
before
the
period
of
which
we
are
writing
and
a
little
grassy
glade
covered
nearly
half
its
surface
the
shores
of
station
island
were
completely
fringed
with
bushes
and
great
care
had
been
taken
to
preserve
them
as
they
answered
as
a
screen
to
conceal
the
persons
and
things
collected
within
their
circle
favored
by
this
shelter
as
well
as
by
that
of
several
thickets
of
trees
and
different
copses
some
six
or
eight
low
huts
had
been
erected
to
be
used
as
quarters
for
the
officer
and
his
men
to
contain
stores
and
to
serve
the
purposes
of
kitchen

these
huts

of
logs

usual
manner

been
roofed
by
bark

from
a
distance
lest
the
signs
of
labor
should
attract
attention

as
they
had
now
been
inhabited
some
months
were
as
comfortable
as
dwellings

extremity
of

a
small
peninsula
with
a
thicket
of

closely
matted
as
nearly
to
prevent
the
possibility

across
it
so
long
as
the
leaves
remained
on
the
branches
near
the
narrow
neck
that
connected
this
acre
with
the
rest
of
the
island
a
small
blockhouse
had
been
erected
with
some
attention
to
its
means
of
resistance
the
logs
were
squared
and
jointed
with
a
care
to
leave
no
defenceless
points
the
windows
were
loopholes
the
door
massive
and
small
and
the
roof
like
the
rest
of
the
structure
was
framed
of
hewn
timber
covered
properly
with
bark
to
exclude
the
rain
the
lower
apartment
as
usual
contained
stores
and
provisions
here
indeed
the
party
kept
all
their
supplies
the
second
story
was
intended
for
a
dwelling
as
well
as
for
the
citadel
and
a
low
garret
was
subdivided
into
two
or
three
rooms
and
could
hold
the
pallets
of
some
ten
or
fifteen
persons
all
the
arrangements
were
exceedingly
simple
and
cheap
but
they
were
sufficient
to
protect
the
soldiers
against
the
effects
of
a
surprise
as
the
whole
building
was
considerably
less
than
forty
feet
high
its
summit
was
concealed
by
the
tops
of
the
trees
except
from
the
eyes
of
those
who
had
reached
the
interior
of
the
island
on
that
side
the
view
was
open
from
the
upper
loops
though
bushes
even
there
more
or
less
concealed
the
base
of
the
wooden
tower
the
object
being
purely
defence
care
had
been
taken
to
place
the
blockhouse
so
near
an
opening
in
the
limestone
rock
that
formed
the
base
of
the
island
as
to
admit
of
a
bucket
being
dropped
into
the
water
in
order
to
obtain
that
great
essential
in
the
event
of
a
siege
in
order
to
facilitate
this
operation
and
to
enfilade
the
base
of
the
building
the
upper
stories
projected
several
feet
beyond
the
lower
in
the
manner
usual
to
blockhouses
and
pieces
of
wood
filled
the
apertures
cut
in
the
log
flooring
which
were
intended
as
loops
and
traps
the
communications
between
the
different
stories
were
by
means
of
ladders
if
we
add
that
these
blockhouses
were
intended
as
citadels
for
garrisons
or
settlements
to
retreat
to
in
the
cases
of
attacks
the
general
reader
will
obtain
a
sufficiently
correct
idea
of
the
arrangements
it
is
our
wish
to
explain
but
the
situation
of
the
island
itself
formed
its
principal
merit
as
a
military
position
lying
in
the
midst
of
twenty
others
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
find
it
since
boats
might
pass
quite
near
and
by
glimpses
caught
through
the
openings
this
particular
island
would
be
taken
for
a
part
of
some
other
indeed
the
channels
between
the
islands
which
lay
around
the
one
we
have
been
describing
were
so
narrow
that
it
was
even
difficult
to
say
which
portions
of
the
land
were
connected
or
which
separated
even
as
one
stood
in
the
centre
with
the
express
desire
of
ascertaining
the
truth
the
little
bay
in
particular
which
jasper
used
as
a
harbor
was
so
embowered
with
bushes
and
shut
in
with
islands
that
the
sails
of
the
cutter
being
lowered
her
own
people
on
one
occasion
had
searched
for
hours
before
they
could
find
the
in
their
return
from
a
short
excursion
among
the
adjacent
channels
in
quest
of
fish
in
short
the
place
was
admirably
adapted
to
its
present
objects
and
its
natural
advantages
had
been
as
ingeniously
improved
as
economy
and
the
limited
means
of
a
frontier
post
would
very
well
allow
the
hour
which
succeeded
the
arrival
of
the
was
one
of
hurried
excitement
the
party
in
possession
had
done
nothing
worthy
of
being
mentioned
and
wearied
with
their
seclusion
they
were
all
eager
to
return
to
oswego
the
sergeant
and
the
officer
he
came
to
relieve
had
no
sooner
gone
through
the
little
ceremonies
of
transferring
the
command
than
the
latter
hurried
on
board
the
with
his
whole
party
and
jasper
who
would
gladly
have
passed
the
day
on
the
island
was
required
to
get
under
way
forthwith
the
wind
promising
a
quick
passage
up
the
river
and
across
the
lake
before
separating
however
lieutenant
muir
cap
and
the
sergeant
had
a
private
conference
with
the
ensign
who
had
been
relieved
in
which
the
last
was
made
acquainted
with
the
suspicions
that
existed
against
the
fidelity
of
the
young
sailor
promising
due
caution
the
officer
embarked
and
in
less
than
three
hours
from
the
time
when
she
had
arrived
the
cutter
was
again
in
motion
mabel
had
taken
possession
of
a
hut
and
with
female
readiness
and
skill
she
made
all
the
simple
little
domestic
arrangements
of
which
the
circumstances
would
admit
not
only
for
her
own
comfort
but
for
that
of
her
father
to
save
labor
a
was
prepared
in
a
hut
set
apart
for
that
purpose
where
all
the
heads
of
the
detachment
were
to
eat
the
soldier
wife
performing
the
necessary
labor
the
hut
of
the
sergeant
which
was
the
best
on
the
island
being
thus
freed
from
any
of
the
vulgar
offices
of
a
household
admitted
of
such
a
display
of
womanly
taste
that
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
on
the
frontier
mabel
felt
proud
of
her
home
as
soon
as
these
important
duties
were
discharged
she
strolled
out
on
the
island
taking
a
path
which
led
through
the
pretty
glade
and
which
conducted
to
the
only
point
not
covered
with
bushes
here
she
stood
gazing
at
the
limpid
water
which
lay
with
scarcely
a
ruffle
on
it
at
her
feet
musing
on
the
novel
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
and
permitting
a
pleasing
and
deep
excitement
to
steal
over
her
feelings
as
she
remembered
the
scenes
through
which
she
had
so
lately
passed
and
conjectured
those
which
still
lay
veiled
in
the
future
you
a
beautiful
fixture
in
a
beautiful
spot
mistress
mabel
said
david
muir
suddenly
appearing
at
her
elbow
and
i
no
engage
not
just
the
handsomest
of
the
i
will
not
say
muir
that
compliments
on
my
person
are
altogether
unwelcome
for
i
should
not
gain
credit
for
speaking
the
truth
perhaps
answered
mabel
with
spirit
but
i
will
say
that
if
you
would
condescend
to
address
to
me
some
remarks
of
a
different
nature
i
may
be
led
to
believe
you
think
i
have
sufficient
faculties
to
understand
hoot
your
mind
beautiful
mabel
is
polished
just
like
the
barrel
of
a
soldier
musket
and
your
conversation
is
only
too
discreet
and
wise
for
a
poor
d
who
has
been
chewing
birch
up
here
these
four
years
on
the
lines
instead
of
receiving
it
in
an
application
that
has
the
virtue
of
imparting
knowledge
but
you
are
no
sorry
i
take
it
young
lady
that
you
got
your
pretty
foot
on
once
i
thought
so
two
hours
since
muir
but
the
looks
so
beautiful
as
she
sails
through
these
vistas
of
trees
that
i
almost
regret
i
am
no
longer
one
of
her
as
mabel
ceased
speaking
she
waved
her
handkerchief
in
return
to
a
salutation
from
jasper
who
kept
his
eyes
fastened
on
her
form
until
the
white
sails
of
the
cutter
had
swept
round
a
point
and
were
nearly
lost
behind
its
green
fringe
of
leaves
there
they
go
and
i
no
say
go
with
them
but
may
they
have
the
luck
to
return
safely
for
without
them
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
passing
the
winter
on
this
island
unless
indeed
we
have
the
alternative
of
the
castle
at
quebec
yon
jasper
is
a
vagrant
sort
of
a
lad
and
they
have
reports
of
him
in
the
garrison
that
it
pains
my
very
heart
to
hear
your
worthy
father
and
almost
as
worthy
uncle
have
none
of
the
best
opinion
of
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
muir
i
doubt
not
that
time
will
remove
all
their
if
time
would
only
remove
mine
pretty
mabel
rejoined
the
quartermaster
in
a
wheedling
tone
i
should
feel
no
envy
of
the
i
think
if
i
were
in
a
condition
to
retire
the
sergeant
would
just
step
into
my
if
my
dear
father
is
worthy
to
step
into
your
shoes
muir
returned
the
girl
with
malicious
pleasure
i
sure
that
the
qualification
is
mutual
and
that
you
are
every
way
worthy
to
step
into
the
deuce
is
in
the
child
you
would
not
reduce
me
to
the
rank
of
a
officer
mabel
no
indeed
sir
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
army
at
all
as
you
spoke
of
retiring
my
thoughts
were
more
egotistical
and
i
was
thinking
how
much
you
reminded
me
of
my
dear
father
by
your
experience
wisdom
and
suitableness
to
take
his
place
as
the
head
of
a
as
its
bridegroom
pretty
mabel
but
not
as
its
parent
or
natural
chief
i
see
how
it
is
with
you
loving
your
repartee
and
brilliant
with
wit
well
i
like
spirit
in
a
young
woman
so
it
be
not
the
spirit
of
a
scold
this
pathfinder
is
all
extraordinair
mabel
if
truth
may
be
said
of
the
truth
should
be
said
of
him
or
nothing
pathfinder
is
my
friend
my
very
particular
friend
muir
and
no
evil
can
be
said
of
him
in
my
presence
that
i
shall
not
i
shall
say
nothing
evil
of
him
i
can
assure
you
mabel
but
at
the
same
time
i
doubt
if
much
good
can
be
said
in
his
he
is
at
least
expert
with
the
rifle
returned
mabel
smiling
that
you
can
not
let
him
have
all
the
credit
of
his
exploits
in
that
way
if
you
please
but
he
is
as
illiterate
as
a
he
may
not
understand
latin
but
his
knowledge
of
iroquois
is
greater
than
that
of
most
men
and
it
is
the
more
useful
language
of
the
two
in
this
part
of
the
if
lundie
himself
were
to
call
on
me
for
an
opinion
which
i
admire
more
your
person
or
your
wit
beautiful
and
caustic
mabel
i
should
be
at
a
loss
to
answer
my
admiration
is
so
nearly
divided
between
them
that
i
often
fancy
this
is
the
one
that
bears
off
the
palm
and
then
the
other
ah
the
late
muir
was
a
paragon
in
that
way
the
latest
muir
did
you
say
sir
asked
mabel
looking
up
innocently
at
her
companion
hoot
hoot
that
is
some
of
pathfinder
scandal
now
i
daresay
that
the
fellow
has
been
trying
to
persuade
you
mabel
that
i
have
had
more
than
one
wife
in
that
case
his
time
would
have
been
thrown
away
sir
as
everybody
knows
that
you
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
have
had
only
three
as
sure
as
my
name
is
david
muir
the
fourth
is
pure
scandal
or
rather
pretty
mabel
she
is
yet
as
they
say
at
rome
and
that
means
in
matters
of
love
in
the
heart
my
well
i
glad
i
not
that
fourth
person
or
in
anything
else
as
i
should
not
like
to
be
a
no
fear
of
that
charming
mabel
for
were
you
the
fourth
all
the
others
would
be
forgotten
and
your
wonderful
beauty
and
merit
would
at
once
elevate
you
to
be
the
first
no
fear
of
your
being
the
fourth
in
any
there
is
consolation
in
that
assurance
muir
said
mabel
laughing
whatever
there
may
be
in
your
other
assurance
for
i
confess
i
should
prefer
being
even
a
beauty
to
being
a
fourth
so
saying
she
tripped
away
leaving
the
quartermaster
to
meditate
on
his
success
mabel
had
been
induced
to
use
her
female
means
of
defence
thus
freely
partly
because
her
suitor
had
of
late
been
so
pointed
as
to
stand
in
need
of
a
pretty
strong
repulse
and
partly
on
account
of
his
innuendoes
against
jasper
and
the
pathfinder
though
full
of
spirit
and
quick
of
intellect
she
was
not
naturally
pert
but
on
the
present
occasion
she
thought
circumstances
called
for
more
than
usual
decision
when
she
left
her
companion
therefore
she
believed
she
was
now
finally
released
from
attentions
which
she
thought
as
as
they
were
certainly
disagreeable
not
so
however
with
david
muir
accustomed
to
rebuffs
and
familiar
with
the
virtue
of
perseverance
he
saw
no
reason
to
despair
though
the
manner
in
which
he
shook
his
head
towards
the
retreating
girl
might
have
betrayed
designs
as
sinister
as
they
were
determined
while
he
was
thus
occupied
the
pathfinder
approached
and
got
within
a
few
feet
of
him
unseen
never
do
quartermaster
never
do
commenced
the
latter
laughing
in
his
noiseless
way
she
is
young
and
active
and
none
but
a
quick
foot
can
overtake
her
they
tell
me
you
are
her
suitor
if
you
are
not
her
and
i
hear
the
same
of
yourself
man
though
the
presumption
would
be
so
great
that
i
scarcely
can
think
it
i
fear
you
right
i
do
yes
i
fear
you
right
when
i
consider
myself
what
i
am
how
little
i
know
and
how
rude
my
life
has
been
i
altogether
distrust
my
claim
even
to
think
a
moment
of
one
so
tutored
and
gay
and
light
of
heart
and
delicate
you
forget
handsome
coarsely
interrupted
muir
and
handsome
too
i
fear
returned
the
meek
and
guide
i
might
have
said
handsome
at
once
among
her
other
qualities
for
the
young
just
as
it
learns
to
bound
is
not
more
pleasant
to
the
eye
of
the
hunter
than
mabel
is
lovely
in
mine
i
do
indeed
fear
that
all
the
thoughts
i
have
harbored
about
her
are
vain
and
if
you
think
this
my
friend
of
your
own
accord
and
natural
modesty
as
it
might
be
my
duty
to
you
as
an
old
compels
me
to
say
quartermaster
interrupted
the
other
regarding
his
companion
keenly
you
and
i
have
lived
together
much
behind
the
ramparts
of
forts
but
very
little
in
the
open
woods
or
in
front
of
the
garrison
or
tent
it
all
passes
for
part
of
the
same
campaign
you
know
pathfinder
and
then
my
duty
keeps
me
much
within
sight
of
the
storehouses
greatly
contrary
to
my
inclinations
as
ye
may
well
suppose
having
yourself
the
ardor
of
battle
in
your
temperament
but
had
ye
heard
what
mabel
had
just
been
saying
of
you
ye
no
think
another
minute
of
making
yourself
agreeable
to
the
saucy
and
uncompromising
pathfinder
looked
earnestly
at
the
lieutenant
for
it
was
impossible
he
should
not
feel
an
interest
in
what
might
be
mabel
opinion
but
he
had
too
much
of
the
innate
and
true
feeling
of
a
gentleman
to
ask
to
hear
what
another
had
said
of
him
muir
however
was
not
to
be
foiled
by
this
and
for
believing
he
had
a
man
of
great
truth
and
simplicity
to
deal
with
he
determined
to
practise
on
his
credulity
as
one
means
of
getting
rid
of
his
rivalry
he
therefore
pursued
the
subject
as
soon
as
he
perceived
that
his
was
stronger
than
his
curiosity
you
ought
to
know
her
opinion
pathfinder
he
continued
and
i
think
every
man
ought
to
hear
what
his
friends
and
acquaintances
say
of
him
and
so
by
way
of
proving
my
own
regard
for
your
character
and
feelings
i
just
tell
you
in
as
few
words
as
possible
you
know
that
mabel
has
a
wicked
malicious
way
with
them
eyes
of
her
own
when
she
has
a
mind
to
be
hard
upon
one
to
me
her
eyes
lieutenant
muir
have
always
seemed
winning
and
soft
though
i
will
acknowledge
that
they
sometimes
laugh
yes
i
have
known
them
to
laugh
and
that
right
heartily
and
with
downright
well
it
was
just
that
then
her
eyes
were
laughing
with
all
their
might
as
it
were
and
in
the
midst
of
all
her
fun
she
broke
out
with
an
exclamation
to
this
effect
i
hope
no
hurt
your
sensibility
pathfinder
i
will
not
say
quartermaster
i
will
not
say
mabel
opinion
of
me
is
of
no
more
account
than
that
of
most
then
i
no
tell
ye
but
just
keep
discretion
on
the
subject
and
why
should
a
man
be
telling
another
what
his
friends
say
of
him
especially
when
they
happen
to
say
that
which
may
not
be
pleasant
to
hear
i
not
add
another
word
to
this
present
i
can
not
make
you
speak
quartermaster
if
you
are
not
so
minded
and
perhaps
it
is
better
for
me
not
to
know
mabel
opinion
as
you
seem
to
think
it
is
not
in
my
favor
ah
me
if
we
could
be
what
we
wish
to
be
instead
of
being
only
what
we
are
there
would
be
a
great
difference
in
our
characters
and
knowledge
and
appearance
one
may
be
rude
and
coarse
and
ignorant
and
yet
happy
if
he
does
not
know
it
but
it
is
hard
to
see
our
own
failings
in
the
strongest
light
just
as
we
wish
to
hear
the
least
about
that
just
the
as
the
french
say
of
the
matter
and
so
i
was
telling
mabel
when
she
ran
away
and
left
me
you
noticed
the
manner
in
which
she
skipped
off
as
you
approached
it
was
very
observable
answered
pathfinder
drawing
a
long
breath
and
clenching
the
barrel
of
his
rifle
as
if
the
fingers
would
bury
themselves
in
the
iron
it
was
more
than
observable
it
was
flagrant
that
just
the
word
and
the
dictionary
would
supply
a
better
after
an
hour
search
well
you
must
know
pathfinder
for
i
can
not
reasonably
deny
you
the
gratification
of
hearing
this
so
you
must
know
the
minx
bounded
off
in
that
manner
in
preference
to
hearing
what
i
had
to
say
in
your
and
what
could
you
find
to
say
in
my
behalf
quartermaster
why
d
understand
my
friend
i
was
ruled
by
circumstances
and
no
ventured
indiscreetly
into
generalities
but
was
preparing
to
meet
particulars
as
it
might
be
with
particulars
if
you
were
thought
wild
or
of
a
frontier
formation
i
could
tell
her
ye
know
that
it
came
of
the
frontier
wild
and
life
ye
led
and
all
her
objections
must
cease
at
once
or
there
would
be
a
sort
of
a
misunderstanding
with
and
did
you
tell
her
this
quartermaster
i
no
swear
to
the
exact
words
but
the
idea
was
prevalent
in
my
mind
ye
understand
the
girl
was
impatient
and
would
not
hear
the
half
i
had
to
say
but
away
she
skipped
as
ye
saw
with
your
own
eyes
pathfinder
as
if
her
opinion
were
fully
made
up
and
she
cared
to
listen
no
longer
i
fear
her
mind
may
be
said
to
have
come
to
its
conclusion
i
fear
it
has
indeed
quartermaster
and
her
father
after
all
is
mistaken
yes
yes
the
sergeant
has
fallen
into
a
grievous
well
man
why
need
ye
lament
and
undo
all
the
grand
reputation
been
so
many
weary
years
making
shoulder
the
rifle
that
ye
use
so
well
and
off
into
the
woods
with
ye
for
there
not
the
female
breathing
that
is
worth
a
heavy
heart
for
a
minute
as
i
know
from
experience
tak
the
word
of
one
who
knows
the
sax
and
has
had
two
wives
that
women
after
all
are
very
much
the
sort
of
creatures
we
do
not
imagine
them
to
be
now
if
you
would
really
mortify
mabel
here
is
as
glorious
an
occasion
as
any
rejected
lover
could
the
last
wish
i
have
lieutenant
would
be
to
mortify
well
ye
come
to
that
in
the
end
notwithstanding
for
human
nature
to
desire
to
give
unpleasant
feelings
to
them
that
give
unpleasant
feelings
to
us
but
a
better
occasion
never
offered
to
make
your
friends
love
you
than
is
to
be
had
at
this
very
moment
and
that
is
the
certain
means
of
causing
one
enemies
to
envy
quartermaster
mabel
is
not
my
inimy
and
if
she
was
the
last
thing
i
could
desire
would
be
to
give
her
an
uneasy
ye
say
so
pathfinder
ye
say
so
and
i
daresay
ye
think
so
but
reason
and
nature
are
both
against
you
as
ye
find
in
the
end
heard
the
saying
me
love
my
dog
well
now
that
means
read
backwards
love
me
do
love
my
dog
now
listen
to
what
is
in
your
power
to
do
you
know
we
occupy
an
exceedingly
precarious
and
uncertain
position
here
almost
in
the
jaws
of
the
lion
as
it
were
do
you
mean
the
frenchers
by
the
lion
and
this
island
as
his
jaws
lieutenant
metaphorically
only
my
friend
for
the
french
are
no
lions
and
this
island
is
not
a
jaw
unless
indeed
it
may
prove
to
be
what
i
greatly
fear
may
come
true
the
of
an
here
the
quartermaster
indulged
in
a
sneering
laugh
that
proclaimed
anything
but
respect
and
admiration
for
his
friend
lundie
sagacity
in
selecting
that
particular
spot
for
his
operations
the
post
is
as
well
chosen
as
any
i
ever
put
foot
in
said
pathfinder
looking
around
him
as
one
surveys
a
picture
i
no
deny
it
i
no
deny
it
lundie
is
a
great
soldier
in
a
small
way
and
his
father
was
a
great
laird
with
the
same
qualification
i
was
born
on
the
estate
and
have
followed
the
major
so
long
that
i
got
to
reverence
all
he
says
and
does
that
just
my
weakness
ye
know
pathfinder
well
this
post
may
be
the
post
of
an
ass
or
of
a
solomon
as
men
fancy
but
it
most
critically
placed
as
is
apparent
by
all
lundie
precautions
and
injunctions
there
are
savages
out
scouting
through
these
thousand
islands
and
over
the
forest
searching
for
this
very
spot
as
is
known
to
lundie
himself
on
certain
information
and
the
greatest
service
you
can
render
the
is
to
discover
their
trails
and
lead
them
off
on
a
false
scent
unhappily
sergeant
dunham
has
taken
up
the
notion
that
the
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
from
because
frontenac
lies
above
us
whereas
all
experience
tells
us
that
indians
come
on
the
side
which
is
most
contrary
to
reason
and
consequently
are
to
be
expected
from
below
take
your
canoe
therefore
and
go
among
the
islands
that
we
may
have
notice
if
any
danger
approaches
from
that
the
big
sarpent
is
on
the
in
that
quarter
and
as
he
knows
the
station
well
no
doubt
he
will
give
us
timely
notice
should
any
wish
to
sarcumvent
us
in
that
he
is
but
an
indian
after
all
pathfinder
and
this
is
an
affair
that
calls
for
the
knowledge
of
a
white
man
lundie
will
be
eternally
grateful
to
the
man
who
shall
help
this
little
enterprise
to
come
off
with
flying
colors
to
tell
you
the
truth
my
friend
he
is
conscious
it
should
never
have
been
attempted
but
he
has
too
much
of
the
old
obstinacy
about
him
to
own
an
error
though
it
be
as
manifest
as
the
morning
the
quartermaster
then
continued
to
reason
with
his
companion
in
order
to
induce
him
to
quit
the
island
without
delay
using
such
arguments
as
first
suggested
themselves
sometimes
contradicting
himself
and
not
unfrequently
urging
at
one
moment
a
motive
that
at
the
next
was
directly
opposed
by
another
the
pathfinder
simple
as
he
was
detected
these
flaws
in
the
lieutenant
philosophy
though
he
was
far
from
suspecting
that
they
proceeded
from
a
desire
to
clear
the
coast
of
mabel
suitor
he
did
not
exactly
suspect
the
secret
objects
of
muir
but
he
was
far
from
being
blind
to
his
sophistry
the
result
was
that
the
two
parted
after
a
long
dialogue
unconvinced
and
distrustful
of
each
motives
though
the
distrust
of
the
guide
like
all
that
was
connected
with
the
man
partook
of
his
own
upright
disinterested
and
ingenuous
nature
a
conference
that
took
place
soon
after
between
sergeant
dunham
and
the
lieutenant
led
to
more
consequences
when
it
was
ended
secret
orders
were
issued
to
the
men
the
blockhouse
was
taken
possession
of
the
huts
were
occupied
and
one
accustomed
to
the
movements
of
soldiers
might
have
detected
that
an
expedition
was
in
the
wind
in
fact
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
sergeant
who
had
been
much
occupied
at
what
was
called
the
harbor
came
into
his
own
hut
followed
by
pathfinder
and
cap
and
as
he
took
his
seat
at
the
neat
table
which
mabel
had
prepared
for
him
he
opened
the
budget
of
his
intelligence
you
are
likely
to
be
of
some
use
here
my
child
the
old
soldier
commenced
as
this
tidy
and
supper
can
testify
and
i
trust
when
the
proper
moment
arrives
you
will
show
yourself
to
be
the
descendant
of
those
who
know
how
to
face
their
you
do
not
expect
me
dear
father
to
play
joan
of
arc
and
to
lead
the
men
to
battle
play
whom
child
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
person
mabel
mentions
pathfinder
not
i
sergeant
but
what
of
that
i
am
ignorant
and
unedicated
and
it
is
too
great
a
pleasure
to
me
to
listen
to
her
voice
and
take
in
her
words
to
be
particular
about
i
know
her
said
cap
decidedly
she
sailed
a
privateer
out
of
morlaix
in
the
last
war
and
good
cruises
she
made
of
mabel
blushed
at
having
inadvertently
made
an
allusion
that
went
beyond
her
father
reading
to
say
nothing
of
her
uncle
dogmatism
and
perhaps
a
little
at
the
pathfinder
simple
ingenuous
earnestness
but
she
did
not
forbear
the
less
to
smile
why
father
i
am
not
expected
to
fall
in
with
the
men
and
to
help
defend
the
island
and
yet
women
have
often
done
such
things
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
girl
as
our
friend
the
pathfinder
here
will
tell
you
but
lest
you
should
be
surprised
at
not
seeing
us
when
you
awake
in
the
morning
it
is
proper
that
i
now
tell
you
we
intend
to
march
in
the
course
of
this
very
father
and
leave
me
and
jennie
on
this
island
alone
no
my
daughter
not
quite
as
unmilitary
as
that
we
shall
leave
lieutenant
muir
brother
cap
corporal
and
three
men
to
compose
the
garrison
during
our
absence
jennie
will
remain
with
you
in
this
hut
and
brother
cap
will
occupy
my
and
muir
said
mabel
half
unconscious
of
what
she
uttered
though
she
foresaw
a
great
deal
of
unpleasant
persecution
in
the
arrangement
why
he
can
make
love
to
you
if
you
like
it
girl
for
he
is
an
amorous
youth
and
having
already
disposed
of
four
wives
is
impatient
to
show
how
much
he
honors
their
memories
by
taking
a
the
quartermaster
tells
me
said
pathfinder
innocently
that
when
a
man
feelings
have
been
harassed
by
so
many
losses
there
is
no
wiser
way
to
soothe
them
than
by
ploughing
up
the
soil
anew
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
traces
of
what
have
gone
over
it
ay
that
is
just
the
difference
between
ploughing
and
harrowing
returned
the
sergeant
with
a
grim
smile
but
let
him
tell
mabel
his
mind
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
his
suit
i
very
well
know
that
daughter
will
never
be
the
wife
of
lieutenant
this
was
said
in
a
way
that
was
tantamount
to
declaring
that
no
daughter
of
his
ever
become
the
wife
of
the
person
in
question
mabel
had
colored
trembled
half
laughed
and
looked
uneasy
but
rallying
her
spirit
she
said
in
a
voice
so
cheerful
as
completely
to
conceal
her
agitation
but
father
we
might
better
wait
until
muir
manifests
a
wish
that
your
daughter
would
have
him
or
rather
a
wish
to
have
your
daughter
lest
we
get
the
fable
of
sour
grapes
thrown
into
our
and
what
is
that
fable
mabel
eagerly
demanded
pathfinder
who
was
anything
but
learned
in
the
ordinary
lore
of
white
men
tell
it
to
us
in
your
own
pretty
way
i
daresay
the
sergeant
never
heard
mabel
repeated
the
fable
and
as
her
suitor
had
desired
in
her
own
pretty
way
which
was
a
way
to
keep
his
eyes
riveted
on
her
face
and
the
whole
of
his
honest
countenance
covered
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
fox
cried
pathfinder
when
she
had
ceased
ay
and
like
a
mingo
too
cunning
and
cruel
that
is
the
way
with
both
the
riptyles
as
to
grapes
they
are
sour
enough
in
this
part
of
the
country
even
to
them
that
can
get
at
them
though
i
daresay
there
are
seasons
and
times
and
places
where
they
are
sourer
to
them
that
ca
i
should
judge
now
my
scalp
is
very
sour
in
mingo
the
sour
grapes
will
be
the
other
way
child
and
it
is
muir
who
will
make
the
complaint
you
would
never
marry
that
man
mabel
not
she
put
in
cap
a
fellow
who
is
only
half
a
soldier
after
all
the
story
of
them
there
grapes
is
quite
a
i
think
little
of
marrying
any
one
dear
father
and
dear
uncle
and
would
rather
talk
about
it
less
if
you
please
but
did
i
think
of
marrying
at
all
i
do
believe
a
man
whose
affections
have
already
been
tried
by
three
or
four
wives
would
scarcely
be
my
the
sergeant
nodded
at
the
guide
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
how
the
land
lies
and
then
he
had
sufficient
consideration
for
his
feelings
to
change
the
subject
neither
you
nor
mabel
brother
cap
he
resumed
can
have
any
legal
authority
with
the
little
garrison
i
leave
behind
on
the
island
but
you
may
counsel
and
influence
strictly
speaking
corporal
will
be
the
commanding
officer
and
i
have
endeavored
to
impress
him
with
a
sense
of
his
dignity
lest
he
might
give
way
too
much
to
the
superior
rank
of
lieutenant
muir
who
being
a
volunteer
can
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
duty
i
wish
you
to
sustain
the
corporal
brother
cap
for
should
the
quartermaster
once
break
through
the
regulations
of
the
expedition
he
may
pretend
to
command
me
as
well
as
more
particularly
should
mabel
really
cut
him
adrift
while
you
are
absent
of
course
sergeant
you
leave
everything
that
is
afloat
under
my
care
the
most
d
ble
confusion
has
grown
out
of
misunderstandings
between
ashore
and
in
one
sense
brother
though
in
a
general
way
the
corporal
is
the
corporal
must
command
but
you
can
counsel
freely
particularly
in
all
matters
relating
to
the
boats
of
which
i
shall
leave
one
behind
to
secure
your
retreat
should
there
be
occasion
i
know
the
corporal
well
he
is
a
brave
man
and
a
good
soldier
and
one
that
may
be
relied
on
if
the
santa
cruz
can
be
kept
from
him
but
then
he
is
a
scotchman
and
will
be
liable
to
the
quartermaster
influence
against
which
i
desire
both
you
and
mabel
to
be
on
your
but
why
leave
us
behind
dear
father
i
have
come
thus
far
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
and
why
not
go
farther
you
are
a
good
girl
mabel
and
very
like
the
dunhams
but
you
must
halt
here
we
shall
leave
the
island
before
the
day
dawns
in
order
not
to
be
seen
by
any
prying
eyes
coming
from
our
cover
and
we
shall
take
the
two
largest
boats
leaving
you
the
other
and
one
bark
canoe
we
are
about
to
go
into
the
channel
used
by
the
french
where
we
shall
lie
in
wait
perhaps
a
week
to
intercept
their
which
are
about
to
pass
up
on
their
way
to
frontenac
loaded
in
particular
with
a
heavy
amount
of
indian
have
you
looked
well
to
your
papers
brother
cap
anxiously
demanded
of
course
you
know
a
capture
on
the
high
seas
is
piracy
unless
your
boat
is
regularly
commissioned
either
as
a
public
or
a
private
armed
i
have
the
honor
to
hold
the
colonel
appointment
as
of
the
returned
the
other
drawing
himself
up
with
dignity
and
that
will
be
sufficient
even
for
the
french
king
if
not
i
have
major
duncan
written
no
papers
then
for
a
warlike
cruiser
they
must
suffice
brother
as
i
have
no
other
it
is
of
vast
importance
to
his
majesty
interests
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
the
boats
in
question
should
be
captured
and
carried
into
oswego
they
contain
the
blankets
trinkets
rifles
ammunition
in
short
all
the
stores
with
which
the
french
bribe
their
accursed
savage
allies
to
commit
their
unholy
acts
setting
at
nought
our
holy
religion
and
its
precepts
the
laws
of
humanity
and
all
that
is
sacred
and
dear
among
men
by
cutting
off
these
supplies
we
shall
derange
their
plans
and
gain
time
on
them
for
the
articles
can
not
be
sent
across
the
ocean
again
this
but
father
does
not
his
majesty
employ
indians
also
asked
mabel
with
some
curiosity
certainly
girl
and
he
has
a
right
to
employ
them
god
bless
him
a
very
different
thing
whether
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
employs
a
savage
as
everybody
can
but
father
i
can
not
see
that
this
alters
the
case
if
it
be
wrong
in
a
frenchman
to
hire
savages
to
fight
his
enemies
it
would
seem
to
be
equally
wrong
in
an
englishman
will
admit
this
pathfinder
it
reasonable
it
reasonable
and
i
have
never
been
one
of
them
that
has
raised
a
cry
the
frenchers
for
doing
the
very
thing
we
do
ourselves
still
it
is
worse
to
consort
with
a
mingo
than
to
consort
with
a
delaware
if
any
of
that
just
tribe
were
left
i
should
think
it
no
sin
to
send
them
out
the
and
yet
they
scalp
and
slay
young
and
old
women
and
children
they
have
their
gifts
mabel
and
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
following
them
natur
is
natur
though
the
different
tribes
have
different
ways
of
showing
it
for
my
part
i
am
white
and
endeavor
to
maintain
white
this
is
all
unintelligible
to
me
answered
mabel
what
is
right
in
king
george
it
would
seem
ought
to
be
right
in
king
as
all
parties
mabel
excepted
seemed
satisfied
with
the
course
the
discussion
had
taken
no
one
appeared
to
think
it
necessary
to
pursue
the
subject
supper
was
no
sooner
ended
than
the
sergeant
dismissed
his
guests
and
then
held
a
long
and
confidential
dialogue
with
his
daughter
he
was
little
addicted
to
giving
way
to
the
gentler
emotions
but
the
novelty
of
his
present
situation
awakened
feelings
that
he
was
unused
to
experience
the
soldier
or
the
sailor
so
long
as
he
acts
under
the
immediate
supervision
of
a
superior
thinks
little
of
the
risks
he
runs
but
the
moment
he
feels
the
responsibility
of
command
all
the
hazards
of
his
undertaking
begin
to
associate
themselves
in
his
mind
with
the
chances
of
success
or
failure
while
he
dwells
less
on
his
own
personal
danger
perhaps
than
when
that
is
the
principal
consideration
he
has
more
lively
general
perceptions
of
all
the
risks
and
submits
more
to
the
influence
of
the
feelings
which
doubt
creates
such
was
now
the
case
with
sergeant
dunham
who
instead
of
looking
forward
to
victory
as
certain
according
to
his
usual
habits
began
to
feel
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
parting
with
his
child
for
ever
never
before
had
mabel
struck
him
as
so
beautiful
as
she
appeared
that
night
possibly
she
never
had
displayed
so
many
engaging
qualities
to
her
father
for
concern
on
his
account
had
begun
to
be
active
in
her
breast
and
then
her
sympathies
met
with
unusual
encouragement
through
those
which
had
been
stirred
up
in
the
sterner
bosom
of
the
veteran
she
had
never
been
entirely
at
her
ease
with
her
parent
the
great
superiority
of
her
education
creating
a
sort
of
chasm
which
had
been
widened
by
the
military
severity
of
manner
he
had
acquired
by
dealing
so
long
with
beings
who
could
only
be
kept
in
subjection
by
an
unremitted
discipline
on
the
present
occasion
however
the
conversation
between
the
father
and
daughter
became
more
confidential
than
usual
until
mabel
rejoiced
to
find
that
it
was
gradually
becoming
endearing
a
state
of
feeling
that
the
girl
had
silently
pined
for
in
vain
ever
since
her
arrival
then
mother
was
about
my
height
mabel
said
as
she
held
one
of
her
father
hands
in
both
her
own
looking
up
into
his
face
with
humid
eyes
i
had
thought
her
that
is
the
way
with
most
children
who
get
a
habit
of
thinking
of
their
parents
with
respect
until
they
fancy
them
larger
and
more
commanding
than
they
actually
are
your
mother
mabel
was
as
near
your
height
as
one
woman
could
be
to
and
her
eyes
father
her
eyes
were
like
thine
child
too
blue
and
soft
and
inviting
like
though
hardly
so
mine
will
never
laugh
again
dearest
father
if
you
do
not
take
care
of
yourself
in
this
thank
you
mabel
hem
thank
you
child
but
i
must
do
my
duty
i
wish
i
had
seen
you
comfortably
married
before
we
left
oswego
my
mind
would
be
married
to
whom
father
you
know
the
man
i
wish
you
to
love
you
may
meet
with
many
gayer
and
many
dressed
in
finer
clother
but
with
none
with
so
true
a
heart
and
just
a
none
father
i
know
of
none
in
these
particulars
pathfinder
has
few
equals
at
but
i
need
not
marry
at
all
you
are
single
and
i
can
remain
to
take
care
of
god
bless
you
mabel
i
know
you
would
and
i
do
not
say
that
the
feeling
is
not
right
for
i
suppose
it
is
and
yet
i
believe
there
is
another
that
is
more
what
can
be
more
right
than
to
honor
one
parents
it
is
just
as
right
to
honor
one
husband
my
dear
but
i
have
no
husband
then
take
one
as
soon
as
possible
that
you
may
have
a
husband
to
honor
i
can
not
live
for
ever
mabel
but
must
drop
off
in
the
course
of
nature
ere
long
if
i
am
not
carried
off
in
the
course
of
war
you
are
young
and
may
yet
live
long
and
it
is
proper
that
you
should
have
a
male
protector
who
can
see
you
safe
through
life
and
take
care
of
you
in
age
as
you
now
wish
to
take
care
of
and
do
you
think
father
said
mabel
playing
with
his
sinewy
fingers
with
her
own
little
hands
and
looking
down
at
them
as
if
they
were
subjects
of
intense
interest
though
her
lips
curled
in
a
slight
smile
as
the
words
came
from
them
and
do
you
think
father
that
pathfinder
is
just
the
man
to
do
this
is
he
not
within
ten
or
twelve
years
as
old
as
yourself
what
of
that
his
life
has
been
one
of
moderation
and
exercise
and
years
are
less
to
be
counted
girl
than
constitution
do
you
know
another
more
likely
to
be
your
protector
mabel
did
not
at
least
another
who
had
expressed
a
desire
to
that
effect
whatever
might
have
been
her
hopes
and
her
wishes
nay
father
we
are
not
talking
of
another
but
of
the
pathfinder
she
answered
evasively
if
he
were
younger
i
think
it
would
be
more
natural
for
me
to
think
of
him
for
a
is
all
in
the
constitution
i
tell
you
child
pathfinder
is
a
younger
man
than
half
our
he
is
certainly
younger
than
one
sir
lieutenant
mabel
laugh
was
joyous
and
as
if
just
then
she
felt
no
care
that
he
is
young
enough
to
be
his
grandson
he
is
younger
in
years
too
god
forbid
mabel
that
you
should
ever
become
an
officer
lady
at
least
until
you
are
an
officer
daughter
there
will
be
little
fear
of
that
father
if
i
marry
pathfinder
returned
the
girl
looking
up
archly
in
the
sergeant
face
again
not
by
the
king
commission
perhaps
though
the
man
is
even
now
the
friend
and
companion
of
generals
i
think
i
could
die
happy
mabel
if
you
were
his
father
is
a
sad
thing
to
go
into
battle
with
the
weight
of
an
unprotected
daughter
laid
upon
the
i
would
give
the
world
to
lighten
yours
of
its
load
my
dear
it
might
be
done
said
the
sergeant
looking
fondly
at
his
child
though
i
could
not
wish
to
put
a
burthen
on
yours
in
order
to
do
the
voice
was
deep
and
tremulous
and
never
before
had
mabel
witnessed
such
a
show
of
affection
in
her
parent
the
habitual
sternness
of
the
man
lent
an
interest
to
his
emotions
which
they
might
otherwise
have
wanted
and
the
daughter
heart
yearned
to
relieve
the
father
mind
father
speak
plainly
she
cried
almost
convulsively
nay
mabel
it
might
not
be
right
your
wishes
and
mine
may
be
very
i
have
no
wishes
know
nothing
of
what
you
mean
would
you
speak
of
my
future
marriage
if
i
could
see
you
promised
to
pathfinder
know
that
you
were
pledged
to
become
his
wife
let
my
own
fate
be
what
it
might
i
think
i
could
die
happy
but
i
will
ask
no
pledge
of
you
my
child
i
will
not
force
you
to
do
what
you
might
repent
kiss
me
mabel
and
go
to
your
had
sergeant
dunham
exacted
of
mabel
the
pledge
that
he
really
so
much
desired
he
would
have
encountered
a
resistance
that
he
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
overcome
but
by
letting
nature
have
its
course
he
enlisted
a
powerful
ally
on
his
side
and
the
mabel
was
ready
to
concede
to
her
affections
much
more
than
she
would
ever
have
yielded
to
menace
at
that
touching
moment
she
thought
only
of
her
parent
who
was
about
to
quit
her
perhaps
for
ever
and
all
of
that
ardent
love
for
him
which
had
possibly
been
as
much
fed
by
the
imagination
as
by
anything
else
but
which
had
received
a
little
check
by
the
restrained
intercourse
of
the
last
fortnight
now
returned
with
a
force
that
was
increased
by
pure
and
intense
feeling
her
father
seemed
all
in
all
to
her
and
to
render
him
happy
there
was
no
proper
sacrifice
which
she
was
not
ready
to
make
one
painful
rapid
almost
wild
gleam
of
thought
shot
across
the
brain
of
the
girl
and
her
resolution
wavered
but
endeavoring
to
trace
the
foundation
of
the
pleasing
hope
on
which
it
was
based
she
found
nothing
positive
to
support
it
trained
like
a
woman
to
subdue
her
most
ardent
feelings
her
thoughts
reverted
to
her
father
and
to
the
blessings
that
awaited
the
child
who
yielded
to
a
parent
wishes
father
she
said
quietly
almost
with
a
holy
calm
god
blesses
the
dutiful
he
will
mabel
we
have
the
good
book
for
i
will
marry
whomever
you
nay
nay
mabel
you
may
have
a
choice
of
your
own
i
have
no
choice
that
is
none
have
asked
me
to
have
a
choice
but
pathfinder
and
muir
and
between
neither
of
us
would
hesitate
no
father
i
will
marry
whomever
you
may
thou
knowest
my
choice
beloved
child
none
other
can
make
thee
as
happy
as
the
well
then
if
he
wish
it
if
he
ask
me
again
for
father
you
would
not
have
me
offer
myself
or
that
any
one
should
do
that
office
for
me
and
the
blood
stole
across
the
pallid
cheeks
of
mabel
as
she
spoke
for
high
and
generous
resolutions
had
driven
back
the
stream
of
life
to
her
heart
no
one
must
speak
to
him
of
it
but
if
he
seek
me
again
and
knowing
all
that
a
true
girl
ought
to
tell
the
man
she
marries
he
then
wishes
to
make
me
his
wife
i
will
be
bless
you
my
mabel
god
in
heaven
bless
you
and
reward
you
as
a
pious
daughter
deserves
to
be
rewarded
yes
father
put
your
mind
at
peace
go
on
this
expedition
with
a
light
heart
and
trust
in
god
for
me
you
will
have
now
no
care
in
the
spring
i
must
have
a
little
time
father
but
in
the
spring
i
will
marry
pathfinder
if
that
hunter
shall
then
desire
mabel
he
loves
you
as
i
loved
your
mother
i
have
seen
him
weep
like
a
child
when
speaking
of
his
feelings
towards
yes
i
believe
it
i
seen
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
he
thinks
better
of
me
than
i
deserve
and
certainly
the
man
is
not
living
for
whom
i
have
more
respect
than
for
pathfinder
not
even
for
you
dear
that
is
as
it
should
be
child
and
the
union
will
be
blessed
may
i
not
tell
pathfinder
this
i
would
rather
you
would
not
father
let
it
come
of
itself
come
the
smile
that
illuminated
mabel
handsome
face
was
angelic
as
even
her
parent
thought
though
one
better
practised
in
detecting
the
passing
emotions
as
they
betray
themselves
in
the
countenance
might
have
traced
something
wild
and
unnatural
in
it
no
no
must
let
things
take
their
course
father
you
have
my
solemn
that
will
do
that
will
do
mabel
now
kiss
me
god
bless
and
protect
you
girl
you
are
a
good
mabel
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
and
sobbed
on
his
bosom
like
an
infant
the
stern
soldier
heart
was
melted
and
the
tears
of
the
two
mingled
but
sergeant
dunham
soon
started
as
if
ashamed
of
himself
and
gently
forcing
his
daughter
from
him
he
bade
her
and
sought
his
pallet
mabel
went
sobbing
to
the
rude
corner
that
had
been
prepared
for
her
reception
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
hut
was
undisturbed
by
any
sound
save
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
veteran
chapter
xx
wandering
i
found
on
my
ruinous
walk
by
the
dial
stone
aged
and
green
one
rose
of
the
wilderness
left
on
its
stalk
to
mark
where
a
garden
had
been
campbell
it
was
not
only
broad
daylight
when
mabel
awoke
but
the
sun
had
actually
been
up
some
time
her
sleep
had
been
tranquil
for
she
rested
on
an
approving
conscience
and
fatigue
contributed
to
render
it
sweet
and
no
sound
of
those
who
had
been
so
early
in
motion
had
interfered
with
her
rest
springing
to
her
feet
and
rapidly
dressing
herself
the
girl
was
soon
breathing
the
fragrance
of
the
morning
in
the
open
air
for
the
first
time
she
was
sensibly
struck
with
the
singular
beauties
as
well
as
with
the
profound
retirement
of
her
present
situation
the
day
proved
to
be
one
of
those
of
the
autumnal
glory
so
common
to
a
climate
that
is
more
abused
than
appreciated
and
its
influence
was
every
way
inspiriting
and
genial
mabel
was
benefitted
by
this
circumstance
for
as
she
fancied
her
heart
was
heavy
on
account
of
the
dangers
to
which
a
father
whom
she
now
began
to
love
as
women
love
when
confidence
is
created
was
exposed
but
the
island
seemed
absolutely
deserted
the
previous
night
the
bustle
of
the
arrival
had
given
the
spot
an
appearance
of
life
which
was
now
entirely
gone
and
our
heroine
had
turned
her
eyes
nearly
around
on
every
object
in
sight
before
she
caught
a
view
of
a
single
human
being
to
remove
the
sense
of
utter
solitude
then
indeed
she
beheld
all
who
were
left
behind
collected
in
a
group
around
a
fire
which
might
be
said
to
belong
to
the
camp
the
person
of
her
uncle
to
whom
she
was
so
much
accustomed
reassured
mabel
and
she
examined
the
remainder
with
a
curiosity
natural
to
her
situation
besides
cap
and
the
quartermaster
there
were
the
corporal
the
three
soldiers
and
the
woman
who
was
cooking
the
huts
were
silent
and
empty
and
the
low
but
summit
of
the
blockhouse
rose
above
the
bushes
by
which
it
was
half
concealed
in
picturesque
beauty
the
sun
was
just
casting
its
brightness
into
the
open
places
of
the
glade
and
the
vault
over
her
head
was
impending
in
the
soft
sublimity
of
the
blue
void
not
a
cloud
was
visible
and
she
secretly
fancied
the
circumstance
might
be
taken
as
a
harbinger
of
peace
and
security
perceiving
that
all
the
others
were
occupied
with
that
great
concern
of
human
nature
a
breakfast
mabel
walked
unobserved
towards
an
end
of
the
island
where
she
was
completely
shut
out
of
view
by
the
trees
and
bushes
here
she
got
a
stand
on
the
very
edge
of
the
water
by
forcing
aside
the
low
branches
and
stood
watching
the
barely
perceptible
flow
and
of
the
miniature
waves
which
laved
the
shore
a
sort
of
physical
echo
to
the
agitation
that
prevailed
on
the
lake
fifty
miles
above
her
the
glimpses
of
natural
scenery
that
offered
were
very
soft
and
pleasing
and
our
heroine
who
had
a
quick
eye
for
all
that
was
lovely
in
nature
was
not
slow
in
selecting
the
most
striking
bits
of
landscape
she
gazed
through
the
different
vistas
formed
by
the
openings
between
the
islands
and
thought
she
had
never
looked
on
aught
more
lovely
while
thus
occupied
mabel
was
suddenly
alarmed
by
fancying
that
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
human
form
among
the
bushes
that
lined
the
shore
of
the
island
which
lay
directly
before
her
the
distance
across
the
water
was
not
a
hundred
yards
and
though
she
might
be
mistaken
and
her
fancy
was
wandering
when
the
form
passed
before
her
sight
still
she
did
not
think
she
could
be
deceived
aware
that
her
sex
would
be
no
protection
against
a
rifle
bullet
should
an
iroquois
get
a
view
of
her
the
girl
instinctively
drew
back
taking
care
to
conceal
her
person
as
much
as
possible
by
the
leaves
while
she
kept
her
own
look
riveted
on
the
opposite
shore
vainly
waiting
for
some
time
in
the
expectation
of
the
stranger
she
was
about
to
quit
her
post
in
the
bushes
and
hasten
to
her
uncle
in
order
to
acquaint
him
of
her
suspicions
when
she
saw
the
branch
of
an
alder
thrust
beyond
the
fringe
of
bushes
on
the
other
island
and
waved
towards
her
significantly
and
as
she
fancied
in
token
of
amity
this
was
a
breathless
and
a
trying
moment
to
one
as
inexperienced
in
frontier
warfare
as
our
heroine
and
yet
she
felt
the
great
necessity
that
existed
for
preserving
her
recollection
and
of
acting
with
steadiness
and
discretion
it
was
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
exposure
to
which
those
who
dwelt
on
the
frontiers
of
america
were
liable
to
bring
out
the
moral
qualities
of
the
women
to
a
degree
which
they
must
themselves
under
other
circumstances
have
believed
they
were
incapable
of
manifesting
and
mabel
well
knew
that
the
borderers
loved
to
dwell
in
their
legends
on
the
presence
of
mind
fortitude
and
spirit
that
their
wives
and
sisters
had
displayed
under
circumstances
the
most
trying
her
emulation
had
been
awakened
by
what
she
had
heard
on
such
subjects
and
it
at
once
struck
her
that
now
was
the
moment
for
her
to
show
that
she
was
truly
sergeant
dunham
child
the
motion
of
the
branch
was
such
as
she
believed
indicated
amity
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
broke
off
a
twig
fastened
it
to
a
stick
and
thrusting
it
through
an
opening
waved
it
in
return
imitating
as
closely
as
possible
the
manner
of
the
other
this
dumb
show
lasted
two
or
three
minutes
on
both
sides
when
mabel
perceived
that
the
bushes
opposite
were
cautiously
pushed
aside
and
a
human
face
appeared
at
an
opening
a
glance
sufficed
to
let
mabel
see
that
it
was
the
countenance
of
a
as
well
as
that
of
a
woman
a
second
and
a
better
look
satisfied
her
that
it
was
the
face
of
the
the
wife
of
arrowhead
during
the
time
she
had
travelled
in
company
with
this
woman
mabel
had
been
won
by
the
gentleness
of
manner
the
meek
simplicity
and
the
mingled
awe
and
affection
with
which
she
regarded
her
husband
once
or
twice
in
the
course
of
the
journey
she
fancied
the
tuscarora
had
manifested
towards
herself
an
unpleasant
degree
of
attention
and
on
those
occasions
it
had
struck
her
that
his
wife
exhibited
sorrow
and
mortification
as
mabel
however
had
more
than
compensated
for
any
pain
she
might
in
this
way
unintentionally
have
caused
her
companion
by
her
own
kindness
of
manner
and
attentions
the
woman
had
shown
much
attachment
to
her
and
they
had
parted
with
a
deep
conviction
on
the
mind
of
our
heroine
that
in
the
she
had
lost
a
friend
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
analyze
all
the
ways
by
which
the
human
heart
is
led
into
confidence
such
a
feeling
however
had
the
young
tuscarora
woman
awakened
in
the
breast
of
our
heroine
and
the
latter
under
the
impression
that
this
extraordinary
visit
was
intended
for
her
own
good
felt
every
disposition
to
have
a
closer
communication
she
no
longer
hesitated
about
showing
herself
clear
of
the
bushes
and
was
not
sorry
to
see
the
imitate
her
confidence
by
stepping
fearlessly
out
of
her
own
cover
the
two
girls
for
the
tuscarora
though
married
was
even
younger
than
mabel
now
openly
exchanged
signs
of
friendship
and
the
latter
beckoned
to
her
friend
to
approach
though
she
knew
not
the
manner
herself
in
which
this
object
could
be
effected
but
the
was
not
slow
in
letting
it
be
seen
that
it
was
in
her
power
for
disappearing
in
a
moment
she
soon
showed
herself
again
in
the
end
of
a
bark
canoe
the
bows
of
which
she
had
drawn
to
the
edge
of
the
bushes
and
of
which
the
body
still
lay
in
a
sort
of
covered
creek
mabel
was
about
to
invite
her
to
cross
when
her
own
name
was
called
aloud
in
the
stentorian
voice
of
her
uncle
making
a
hurried
gesture
for
the
tuscarora
girl
to
conceal
herself
mabel
sprang
from
the
bushes
and
tripped
up
the
glade
towards
the
sound
and
perceived
that
the
whole
party
had
just
seated
themselves
at
breakfast
cap
having
barely
put
his
appetite
under
sufficient
restraint
to
summon
her
to
join
them
that
this
was
the
most
favorable
instant
for
the
interview
flashed
on
the
mind
of
mabel
and
excusing
herself
on
the
plea
of
not
being
prepared
for
the
meal
she
bounded
back
to
the
thicket
and
soon
renewed
her
communications
with
the
young
indian
woman
was
quick
of
comprehension
and
with
half
a
dozen
noiseless
strokes
of
the
paddles
her
canoe
was
concealed
in
the
bushes
of
station
island
in
another
minute
mabel
held
her
hand
and
was
leading
her
through
the
grove
towards
her
own
hut
fortunately
the
latter
was
so
placed
as
to
be
completely
hid
from
the
sight
of
those
at
the
fire
and
they
both
entered
it
unseen
hastily
explaining
to
her
guest
in
the
best
manner
she
could
the
necessity
of
quitting
her
for
a
short
time
mabel
first
placing
the
in
her
own
room
with
a
full
certainty
that
she
would
not
quit
it
until
told
to
do
so
went
to
the
fire
and
took
her
seat
among
the
rest
with
all
the
composure
it
was
in
her
power
to
command
late
come
late
served
mabel
said
her
uncle
between
mouthfuls
of
broiled
salmon
for
though
the
cookery
might
be
very
unsophisticated
on
that
remote
frontier
the
viands
were
generally
delicious
late
come
late
served
it
is
a
good
rule
and
keeps
laggards
up
to
their
i
am
no
laggard
uncle
for
i
have
been
stirring
nearly
an
hour
and
exploring
our
it
little
you
make
o
that
mistress
mabel
put
in
muir
little
by
nature
lundie
or
it
might
be
better
to
style
him
major
duncan
in
this
presence
this
was
said
in
consideration
of
the
corporal
and
the
common
men
though
they
were
taking
their
meal
a
little
apart
has
not
added
an
empire
to
his
majesty
dominions
in
getting
possession
of
this
island
which
is
likely
to
equal
that
of
the
celebrated
sancho
in
revenues
and
profits
sancho
of
whom
doubtless
master
cap
you
often
have
been
reading
in
your
leisure
hours
more
especially
in
calms
and
moments
of
i
know
the
spot
you
mean
quartermaster
sancho
island
coral
rock
of
new
formation
and
as
bad
a
landfall
in
a
dark
night
and
blowing
weather
as
a
sinner
could
wish
to
keep
clear
of
it
a
famous
place
for
cocoanuts
and
bitter
water
that
sancho
it
no
very
famous
for
dinners
returned
muir
repressing
the
smile
which
was
struggling
to
his
lips
out
of
respect
to
mabel
nor
do
i
think
there
be
much
to
choose
between
its
revenue
and
that
of
this
spot
in
my
judgment
master
cap
this
is
a
very
unmilitary
position
and
i
look
to
some
calamity
befalling
it
sooner
or
it
is
to
be
hoped
not
until
our
turn
of
duty
is
over
observed
mabel
i
have
no
wish
to
study
the
french
we
might
think
ourselves
happy
did
it
not
prove
to
be
the
iroquois
i
have
reasoned
with
major
duncan
on
the
occupation
of
this
position
but
wilfu
man
maun
ha
his
way
my
first
object
in
accompanying
this
party
was
to
endeavor
to
make
myself
acceptable
and
useful
to
your
beautiful
niece
master
cap
and
the
second
was
to
take
such
an
account
of
the
stores
that
belong
to
my
particular
department
as
shall
leave
no
question
open
to
controversy
concerning
the
manner
of
expenditure
when
they
shall
have
disappeared
by
means
of
the
do
you
look
upon
matters
as
so
serious
demanded
cap
actually
suspending
his
mastication
of
a
bit
of
venison
for
he
passed
alternately
from
fish
to
flesh
and
back
again
in
the
interest
he
took
in
the
answer
is
the
danger
pressing
i
no
say
just
that
and
i
no
say
just
the
contrary
there
is
always
danger
in
war
and
there
is
more
of
it
at
the
advanced
posts
than
at
the
main
encampment
it
ought
therefore
to
occasion
no
surprise
were
we
to
be
visited
by
the
french
at
any
and
what
the
devil
is
to
be
done
in
that
case
six
men
and
two
women
would
make
but
a
poor
job
in
defending
such
a
place
as
this
should
the
enemy
invade
us
as
no
doubt
they
would
take
very
good
care
to
come
that
we
may
depend
on
some
very
formidable
force
at
the
very
lowest
a
military
disposition
might
be
made
in
defence
of
the
island
out
of
all
question
and
according
to
the
art
of
war
though
we
would
probably
fail
in
the
force
necessary
to
carry
out
the
design
in
any
very
creditable
manner
in
the
first
place
a
detachment
should
be
sent
off
to
the
shore
with
orders
to
annoy
the
enemy
in
landing
a
strong
party
ought
instantly
to
be
thrown
into
the
blockhouse
as
the
citadel
for
on
that
all
the
different
detachments
would
naturally
fall
back
for
support
as
the
french
advanced
and
an
entrenched
camp
might
be
laid
out
around
the
stronghold
as
it
would
be
very
unmilitary
indeed
to
let
the
foe
get
near
enough
to
the
foot
of
the
walls
to
mine
them
would
keep
the
cavalry
in
check
and
as
for
the
artillery
redoubts
should
be
thrown
up
under
cover
of
yon
woods
strong
skirmishing
parties
moreover
would
be
exceedingly
serviceable
in
retarding
the
march
of
the
enemy
and
these
different
huts
if
properly
piqueted
and
ditched
would
be
converted
into
very
eligible
positions
for
that
quartermaster
and
who
the
d
is
to
find
all
the
men
to
carry
out
such
a
plan
the
king
out
of
all
question
master
cap
it
is
his
quarrel
and
just
he
should
bear
the
burthen
o
and
we
are
only
six
this
is
fine
talking
with
a
vengeance
you
could
be
sent
down
to
the
shore
to
oppose
the
landing
mabel
might
skirmish
with
her
tongue
at
least
the
soldier
wife
might
act
to
entangle
the
cavalry
the
corporal
should
command
the
entrenched
camp
his
three
men
could
occupy
the
five
huts
and
i
would
take
the
blockhouse
you
describe
well
lieutenant
and
should
have
been
a
limner
instead
of
a
na
i
been
very
literal
and
upright
in
my
exposition
of
matters
that
there
is
no
greater
force
here
to
carry
out
the
plan
is
a
fault
of
his
majesty
ministers
and
none
of
but
should
our
enemy
really
appear
asked
mabel
with
more
interest
than
she
might
have
shown
had
she
not
remembered
the
guest
in
the
hut
what
course
ought
we
to
pursue
my
advice
would
be
to
attempt
to
achieve
that
pretty
mabel
which
rendered
xenophon
so
justly
i
think
you
mean
a
retreat
though
i
half
guess
at
your
you
imagined
my
meaning
from
the
possession
of
a
strong
native
sense
young
lady
i
am
aware
that
your
worthy
father
has
pointed
out
to
the
corporal
certain
modes
and
methods
by
which
he
fancies
this
island
could
be
held
in
case
the
french
should
discover
its
position
but
the
excellent
sergeant
though
your
father
and
as
good
a
man
in
his
duties
as
ever
wielded
a
spontoon
is
not
the
great
lord
stair
or
even
the
duke
of
marlborough
i
not
deny
the
sergeant
merits
in
his
particular
sphere
though
i
can
not
exaggerate
qualities
however
excellent
into
those
of
men
who
may
be
in
some
trifling
degree
his
superiors
sergeant
dunham
has
taken
counsel
of
his
heart
instead
of
his
head
in
resolving
to
issue
such
orders
but
if
the
fort
fall
the
blame
will
lie
on
him
that
ordered
it
to
be
occupied
and
not
on
him
whose
duty
it
was
to
defend
it
whatever
may
be
the
determination
of
the
latter
should
the
french
and
their
allies
land
a
good
commander
never
neglects
the
preparations
necessary
to
effect
a
retreat
and
i
would
advise
master
cap
who
is
the
admiral
of
our
navy
to
have
a
boat
in
readiness
to
evacuate
the
island
if
need
comes
to
need
the
largest
boat
that
we
have
left
carries
a
very
ample
sail
and
by
hauling
it
round
here
and
mooring
it
under
those
bushes
there
will
be
a
convenient
place
for
a
hurried
embarkation
and
then
you
perceive
pretty
mabel
that
it
is
scarcely
fifty
yards
before
we
shall
be
in
a
channel
between
two
other
islands
and
hid
from
the
sight
of
those
who
may
happen
to
be
on
all
that
you
say
is
very
true
muir
but
may
not
the
french
come
from
that
quarter
themselves
if
it
is
so
good
for
a
retreat
it
is
equally
good
for
an
they
no
have
the
sense
to
do
so
discreet
a
thing
returned
muir
looking
furtively
and
a
little
uneasily
around
him
they
no
have
sufficient
discretion
your
french
are
a
nation
and
usually
come
forward
in
a
random
way
so
we
may
look
for
them
if
they
come
at
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
the
discourse
now
became
exceedingly
desultory
touching
principally
however
on
the
probabilities
of
an
invasion
and
the
best
means
of
meeting
it
to
most
of
this
mabel
paid
but
little
attention
though
she
felt
some
surprise
that
lieutenant
muir
an
officer
whose
character
for
courage
stood
well
should
openly
recommend
an
abandonment
of
what
appeared
to
her
to
be
doubly
a
duty
her
father
character
being
connected
with
the
defence
of
the
island
her
mind
however
was
so
much
occupied
with
her
guest
that
seizing
the
first
favorable
moment
she
left
the
table
and
was
soon
in
her
own
hut
again
carefully
fastening
the
door
and
seeing
that
the
simple
curtain
was
drawn
before
the
single
little
window
mabel
next
led
the
or
june
as
she
was
familiarly
termed
by
those
who
spoke
to
her
in
english
into
the
outer
room
making
signs
of
affection
and
confidence
i
am
glad
to
see
you
june
said
mabel
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
and
in
her
own
winning
voice
very
glad
to
see
you
what
has
brought
you
hither
and
how
did
you
discover
the
island
speak
slow
said
june
returning
smile
for
smile
and
pressing
the
little
hand
she
held
with
one
of
her
own
that
was
scarcely
larger
though
it
had
been
hardened
by
labor
more
slow
too
mabel
repeated
her
questions
endeavoring
to
repress
the
impetuosity
of
her
feelings
and
she
succeeded
in
speaking
so
distinctly
as
to
be
understood
june
friend
returned
the
indian
woman
i
believe
you
june
from
my
soul
i
believe
you
what
has
this
to
do
with
your
visit
friend
come
to
see
friend
answered
june
again
smiling
openly
in
the
other
face
there
is
some
other
reason
june
else
would
you
never
run
this
risk
and
alone
you
are
alone
june
june
wid
you
no
one
else
june
come

i
know
so
you
would
not
be
treacherous
with
me
june
what
treacherous
you
would
not
betray
me
would
not
give
me
to
the
french
to
the
iroquois
to
arrowhead
june
shook
her
head
earnestly
you
would
not
sell
my
scalp
here
june
passed
her
arm
fondly
around
the
slender
waist
of
mabel
and
pressed
her
to
her
heart
with
a
tenderness
and
affection
that
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
our
heroine
it
was
done
in
the
fond
caressing
manner
of
a
woman
and
it
was
scarcely
possible
that
it
should
not
obtain
credit
for
sincerity
with
a
young
and
ingenuous
person
of
the
same
sex
mabel
returned
the
pressure
and
then
held
the
other
off
at
the
length
of
her
arm
looked
her
steadily
in
the
face
and
continued
her
inquiries
if
june
has
something
to
tell
her
friend
let
her
speak
plainly
she
said
my
ears
are
june
arrowhead
kill
but
arrowhead
will
never
know
mabel
blood
mounted
to
her
temples
as
she
said
this
for
she
felt
that
she
was
urging
a
wife
to
be
treacherous
to
her
husband
that
is
mabel
will
not
tell
he
bury
tomahawk
in
june
that
must
never
be
dear
june
i
would
rather
you
should
say
no
more
than
run
this
blockhouse
good
place
to
sleep
good
place
to
do
you
mean
that
i
may
save
my
life
by
keeping
in
the
blockhouse
june
surely
surely
arrowhead
will
not
hurt
you
for
telling
me
that
he
can
not
wish
me
any
great
harm
for
i
never
injured
arrowhead
wish
no
harm
to
handsome
returned
june
averting
her
face
and
though
she
always
spoke
in
the
soft
gentle
voice
of
an
indian
girl
now
permitting
its
notes
to
fall
so
low
as
to
cause
them
to
sound
melancholy
and
timid
arrowhead
love
mabel
blushed
she
knew
not
why
and
for
a
moment
her
questions
were
repressed
by
a
feeling
of
inherent
delicacy
but
it
was
necessary
to
know
more
for
her
apprehensions
had
been
keenly
awakened
and
she
resumed
her
inquiries
arrowhead
can
have
no
reason
to
love
or
to
hate
she
said
is
he
near
you
husband
always
near
wife
here
said
june
laying
her
hand
on
her
heart
excellent
creature
but
tell
me
june
ought
i
to
keep
in
the
blockhouse
this
morning
now
blockhouse
very
good
good
for
women
blockhouse
got
no
i
fear
i
understand
you
only
too
well
june
do
you
wish
to
see
my
father
no
here
gone
you
can
not
know
that
june
you
see
the
island
is
full
of
his
no
full
gone
away
here
june
held
up
four
of
her
fingers
so
many
and
pathfinder
would
you
not
like
to
see
the
pathfinder
he
can
talk
to
you
in
the
iroquois
tongue
gone
wid
him
said
june
laughing
keep
tongue
in
his
there
was
something
so
sweet
and
contagious
in
the
infantile
laugh
of
an
indian
girl
that
mabel
could
not
refrain
from
joining
in
it
much
as
her
fears
were
aroused
by
all
that
had
passed
you
appear
to
know
or
to
think
you
know
all
about
us
june
but
if
pathfinder
be
gone
can
speak
french
too
you
know
shall
i
run
and
bring
him
to
talk
with
you
gone
too
all
but
heart
that
as
june
said
this
she
laughed
again
looked
in
different
directions
as
if
unwilling
to
confuse
the
other
and
laid
her
hand
on
mabel
bosom
our
heroine
had
often
heard
of
the
wonderful
sagacity
of
the
indians
and
of
the
surprising
manner
in
which
they
noted
all
things
while
they
appeared
to
regard
none
but
she
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
direction
the
discourse
had
so
singularly
taken
willing
to
change
it
and
at
the
same
time
truly
anxious
to
learn
how
great
the
danger
that
impended
over
them
might
really
be
she
rose
from
the
on
which
she
had
been
seated
and
by
assuming
an
attitude
of
less
affectionate
confidence
she
hoped
to
hear
more
of
that
she
really
desired
to
learn
and
to
avoid
allusions
to
that
which
she
found
so
embarrassing
you
know
how
much
or
how
little
you
ought
to
tell
me
june
she
said
and
i
hope
you
love
me
well
enough
to
give
me
the
information
i
ought
to
hear
my
dear
uncle
too
is
on
the
island
and
you
are
or
ought
to
be
his
friend
as
well
as
mine
and
both
of
us
will
remember
your
conduct
when
we
get
back
to
maybe
never
get
back
who
know
this
was
said
doubtingly
or
as
one
who
lays
down
an
uncertain
proposition
and
not
with
a
taunt
or
a
desire
to
alarm
no
one
knows
what
will
happen
but
god
our
lives
are
in
his
hands
still
i
think
you
are
to
be
his
instrument
in
saving
this
passed
june
comprehension
and
she
only
looked
her
ignorance
for
it
was
evident
she
wished
to
be
of
use
blockhouse
very
good
she
repeated
as
soon
as
her
countenance
ceased
to
express
uncertainty
laying
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
two
words
well
i
understand
this
june
and
will
sleep
in
it
of
course
i
am
to
tell
my
uncle
what
you
have
said
the
started
and
she
discovered
a
very
manifest
uneasiness
at
the
interrogatory
no
no
no
no
she
answered
with
a
volubility
and
vehemence
that
was
imitated
from
the
french
of
the
canadas
no
good
to
tell
saltwater
he
much
talk
and
long
tongue
thinks
woods
all
water
understand
tell
arrowhead
and
june
you
do
my
dear
uncle
injustice
for
he
would
be
as
little
likely
to
betray
you
as
any
no
understand
saltwater
got
tongue
but
no
eyes
no
ears
no
nose
but
tongue
tongue
tongue
although
mabel
did
not
exactly
coincide
in
this
opinion
she
saw
that
cap
had
not
the
confidence
of
the
young
indian
woman
and
that
it
was
idle
to
expect
she
would
consent
to
his
being
admitted
to
their
interview
you
appear
to
think
you
know
our
situation
pretty
well
june
mabel
continued
have
you
been
on
the
island
before
this
visit
just
how
then
do
you
know
that
what
you
say
is
true
my
father
the
pathfinder
and
may
all
be
here
within
sound
of
my
voice
if
i
choose
to
call
all
gone
said
june
positively
smiling
at
the
same
time
nay
this
is
more
than
you
can
say
certainly
not
having
been
over
the
island
to
examine
got
good
eyes
see
boat
with
men
go
away
see
ship
with
then
you
have
been
some
time
watching
us
i
think
however
you
have
not
counted
them
that
june
laughed
held
up
her
four
fingers
again
and
then
pointed
to
her
two
thumbs
passing
a
finger
over
the
first
she
repeated
the
words
and
touching
the
last
she
added
saltwater
all
this
was
being
very
accurate
and
mabel
began
to
entertain
serious
doubts
as
to
the
propriety
of
her
permitting
her
visitor
to
depart
without
her
becoming
more
explicit
still
it
was
so
repugnant
to
her
feelings
to
abuse
the
confidence
this
gentle
and
affectionate
creature
had
evidently
reposed
in
her
that
mabel
had
no
sooner
admitted
the
thought
of
summoning
her
uncle
than
she
rejected
it
as
unworthy
of
herself
and
unjust
to
her
friend
to
aid
this
good
resolution
too
there
was
the
certainty
that
june
would
reveal
nothing
but
take
refuge
in
a
stubborn
silence
if
any
attempt
were
made
to
coerce
her
you
think
then
june
mabel
continued
as
soon
as
these
thoughts
had
passed
through
her
mind
that
i
had
better
live
in
the
blockhouse
good
place
for
woman
blockhouse
got
no
scalp
logs
you
speak
confidently
june
as
if
you
had
been
in
it
and
had
measured
its
june
laughed
and
she
looked
knowing
though
she
said
nothing
does
any
one
but
yourself
know
how
to
find
this
island
have
any
of
the
iroquois
seen
it
june
looked
sad
and
she
cast
her
eyes
warily
about
her
as
if
distrusting
a
listener
tuscarora
everywhere
oswego
here
frontenac
mohawk
everywhere
if
he
see
june
kill
but
we
thought
that
no
one
knew
of
this
island
and
that
we
had
no
reason
to
fear
our
enemies
while
on
much
eye
eyes
will
not
always
do
june
this
spot
is
hid
from
ordinary
sight
and
few
of
even
our
own
people
know
how
to
find
one
man
can
tell
some
yengeese
talk
mabel
felt
a
chill
at
her
heart
all
the
suspicions
against
jasper
which
she
had
hitherto
disdained
entertaining
crowded
in
a
body
on
her
thoughts
and
the
sensation
that
they
brought
was
so
sickening
that
for
an
instant
she
imagined
she
was
about
to
faint
arousing
herself
and
remembering
her
promise
to
her
father
she
arose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
hut
for
a
minute
fancying
that
jasper
delinquencies
were
naught
to
her
though
her
inmost
heart
yearned
with
the
desire
to
think
him
innocent
i
understand
your
meaning
june
she
then
said
you
wish
me
to
know
that
some
one
has
treacherously
told
your
people
where
and
how
to
find
the
island
june
laughed
for
in
her
eyes
artifice
in
war
was
oftener
a
merit
than
a
crime
but
she
was
too
true
to
her
tribe
herself
to
say
more
than
the
occasion
required
her
object
was
to
save
mabel
and
mabel
only
and
she
saw
no
sufficient
reason
for
travelling
out
of
the
record
as
the
lawyers
express
it
in
order
to
do
anything
else
know
now
she
added
blockhouse
good
for
girl
no
matter
for
men
and
but
it
is
much
matter
with
me
june
for
one
of
those
men
is
my
uncle
whom
i
love
and
the
others
are
my
countrymen
and
friends
i
must
tell
them
what
has
then
june
be
kill
returned
the
young
indian
quietly
though
she
evidently
spoke
with
concern
no
they
shall
not
know
that
you
have
been
here
still
they
must
be
on
their
guard
and
we
can
all
go
into
the
arrowhead
know
see
everything
and
june
be
kill
june
come
to
tell
young
friend
not
to
tell
men
every
warrior
watch
his
own
scalp
june
woman
and
tell
woman
no
tell
mabel
was
greatly
distressed
at
this
declaration
of
her
wild
friend
for
it
was
now
evident
the
young
creature
understood
that
her
communication
was
to
go
no
further
she
was
ignorant
how
far
these
people
consider
the
point
of
honor
interested
in
her
keeping
the
secret
and
most
of
all
was
she
unable
to
say
how
far
any
indiscretion
of
her
own
might
actually
commit
june
and
endanger
her
life
all
these
considerations
flashed
on
her
mind
and
reflection
only
rendered
their
influence
more
painful
june
too
manifestly
viewed
the
matter
gravely
for
she
began
to
gather
up
the
different
little
articles
she
had
dropped
in
taking
mabel
hand
and
was
preparing
to
depart
to
attempt
detaining
her
was
out
of
the
question
and
to
part
from
her
after
all
she
had
hazarded
to
serve
her
was
repugnant
to
all
the
just
and
kind
feelings
of
our
heroine
nature
june
said
she
eagerly
folding
her
arms
round
the
gentle
but
uneducated
being
we
are
friends
from
me
you
have
nothing
to
fear
for
no
one
shall
know
of
your
visit
if
you
could
give
me
some
signal
just
before
the
danger
comes
some
sign
by
which
to
know
when
to
go
into
the
blockhouse
how
to
take
care
of
june
paused
for
she
had
been
in
earnest
in
her
intention
to
depart
and
then
she
said
quietly
bring
june
a
pigeon
where
shall
i
find
a
pigeon
to
bring
you
next
hut
bring
old
one
june
go
to
i
think
i
understand
you
june
but
had
i
not
better
lead
you
back
to
the
bushes
lest
you
meet
some
of
the
men
go
out
first
count
men
one
two
four
five
six
here
june
held
up
her
fingers
and
laughed
all
out
of
the
way
good
all
but
one
call
him
one
side
then
sing
and
fetch
mabel
smiled
at
the
readiness
and
ingenuity
of
the
girl
and
prepared
to
execute
her
requests
at
the
door
however
she
stopped
and
looked
back
entreatingly
at
the
indian
woman
is
there
no
hope
of
your
telling
me
more
june
she
said
know
all
now
blockhouse
good
pigeon
tell
arrowhead
the
last
words
sufficed
for
mabel
could
not
urge
further
communications
when
her
companion
herself
told
her
that
the
penalty
of
her
revelations
might
be
death
by
the
hand
of
her
husband
throwing
open
the
door
she
made
a
sign
of
adieu
to
june
and
went
out
of
the
hut
mabel
resorted
to
the
simple
expedient
of
the
young
indian
girl
to
ascertain
the
situation
of
the
different
individuals
on
the
island
instead
of
looking
about
her
with
the
intention
of
recognizing
faces
and
dresses
she
merely
counted
them
and
found
that
three
still
remained
at
the
fire
while
two
had
gone
to
the
boat
one
of
whom
was
muir
the
sixth
man
was
her
uncle
and
he
was
coolly
arranging
some
at
no
great
distance
from
the
fire
the
woman
was
just
entering
her
own
hut
and
this
accounted
for
the
whole
party
mabel
now
affecting
to
have
dropped
something
returned
nearly
to
the
hut
she
had
left
warbling
an
air
stooped
as
if
to
pick
up
some
object
from
the
ground
and
hurried
towards
the
hut
june
had
mentioned
this
was
a
dilapidated
structure
and
it
had
been
converted
by
the
soldiers
of
the
last
detachment
into
a
sort
of
storehouse
for
their
live
stock
among
other
things
it
contained
a
few
dozen
pigeons
which
were
regaling
on
a
pile
of
wheat
that
had
been
brought
off
from
one
of
the
farms
plundered
on
the
canada
shore
mabel
had
not
much
difficulty
in
catching
one
of
these
pigeons
although
they
fluttered
and
flew
about
the
hut
with
a
noise
like
that
of
drums
and
concealing
it
in
her
dress
she
stole
back
towards
her
own
hut
with
the
prize
it
was
empty
and
without
doing
more
than
cast
a
glance
in
at
the
door
the
eager
girl
hurried
down
to
the
shore
she
had
no
difficulty
in
escaping
observation
for
the
trees
and
bushes
made
a
complete
cover
to
her
person
at
the
canoe
she
found
june
who
took
the
pigeon
placed
it
in
a
basket
of
her
own
manufacturing
and
repeating
the
words
blockhouse
good
she
glided
out
of
the
bushes
and
across
the
narrow
passage
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
mabel
waited
some
time
to
catch
a
signal
of
or
amity
after
her
friend
had
landed
but
none
was
given
the
adjacent
islands
without
exception
were
as
quiet
as
if
no
one
had
ever
disturbed
the
sublime
repose
of
nature
and
nowhere
could
any
sign
or
symptom
be
discovered
as
mabel
then
thought
that
might
denote
the
proximity
of
the
sort
of
danger
of
which
june
had
given
notice
on
returning
however
from
the
shore
mabel
was
struck
with
a
little
circumstance
that
in
an
ordinary
situation
would
have
attracted
no
attention
but
which
now
that
her
suspicions
had
been
aroused
did
not
pass
before
her
uneasy
eye
unnoticed
a
small
piece
of
red
bunting
such
as
is
used
in
the
ensigns
of
ships
was
fluttering
at
the
lower
branch
of
a
small
tree
fastened
in
a
way
to
permit
it
to
blow
out
or
to
droop
like
a
vessel
pennant
now
that
mabel
fears
were
awakened
june
herself
could
not
have
manifested
greater
quickness
in
analyzing
facts
that
she
believed
might
affect
the
safety
of
the
party
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
bit
of
cloth
could
be
observed
from
an
adjacent
island
that
it
lay
so
near
the
line
between
her
own
hut
and
the
canoe
as
to
leave
no
doubt
that
june
had
passed
near
it
if
not
directly
under
it
and
that
it
might
be
a
signal
to
communicate
some
important
fact
connected
with
the
mode
of
attack
to
those
who
were
probably
lying
in
ambush
near
them
tearing
the
little
strip
of
bunting
from
the
tree
mabel
hastened
on
scarcely
knowing
what
her
duty
next
required
of
her
june
might
be
false
to
her
but
her
manner
her
looks
her
affection
and
her
disposition
as
mabel
had
known
it
in
the
journey
forbade
the
idea
then
came
the
allusion
to
arrowhead
admiration
of
the
beauties
some
dim
recollections
of
the
looks
of
the
tuscarora
and
a
painful
consciousness
that
few
wives
could
view
with
kindness
one
who
had
estranged
a
affections
none
of
these
images
were
distinct
and
clear
but
they
rather
gleamed
over
the
mind
of
our
heroine
than
rested
in
it
and
they
quickened
her
pulses
as
they
did
her
step
without
bringing
with
them
the
prompt
and
clear
decisions
that
usually
followed
her
reflections
she
had
hurried
onwards
towards
the
hut
occupied
by
the
soldier
wife
intending
to
remove
at
once
to
the
blockhouse
with
the
woman
though
she
could
persuade
no
other
to
follow
when
her
impatient
walk
was
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
muir
whither
so
fast
pretty
mabel
he
cried
and
why
so
given
to
solitude
the
worthy
sergeant
will
deride
my
breeding
if
he
hear
that
his
daughter
passes
the
mornings
alone
and
unattended
to
though
he
well
knows
it
is
my
ardent
wish
to
be
her
slave
and
companion
from
the
beginning
of
the
year
to
its
surely
muir
you
must
have
some
authority
here
mabel
suddenly
arrested
her
steps
to
say
one
of
your
rank
would
be
listened
to
at
least
by
a
corporal
i
do
know
that
i
do
know
that
interrupted
muir
with
an
impatience
and
appearance
of
alarm
that
might
have
excited
attention
at
another
moment
command
is
command
discipline
discipline
and
authority
authority
your
good
father
would
be
sore
grieved
did
he
find
me
interfering
to
sully
or
carry
off
the
laurels
he
is
about
to
win
and
i
can
not
command
the
corporal
without
equally
commanding
the
sergeant
the
wisest
way
will
be
for
me
to
remain
in
the
obscurity
of
a
private
individual
in
this
enterprise
and
it
is
so
that
all
parties
from
lundie
down
understand
the
this
i
know
and
it
may
be
well
nor
would
i
give
my
dear
father
any
cause
of
complaint
but
you
may
influence
the
corporal
to
his
own
i
no
say
that
returned
muir
in
his
sly
scotch
way
it
would
be
far
safer
to
promise
to
influence
him
to
his
injury
mankind
pretty
mabel
have
their
peculiarities
and
to
influence
a
to
his
own
good
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
tasks
of
human
nature
while
the
opposite
is
just
the
easiest
you
no
forget
this
my
dear
but
bear
it
in
mind
for
your
edification
and
government
but
what
is
that
twisting
round
your
slender
finger
as
you
may
be
said
to
twist
hearts
it
is
nothing
but
a
bit
of
cloth
a
sort
of
flag
a
trifle
that
is
hardly
worth
our
attention
at
this
grave
moment
if
a
trifle
it
no
so
trifling
as
ye
may
imagine
mistress
mabel
taking
the
bit
of
bunting
from
her
and
stretching
it
at
full
length
with
both
his
arms
extended
while
his
face
grew
grave
and
his
eye
watchful
ye
no
ha
been
finding
this
mabel
dunham
in
the
breakfast
mabel
simply
acquainted
him
with
the
spot
where
and
the
manner
in
which
she
had
found
the
bit
of
cloth
while
she
was
speaking
the
eye
of
the
quartermaster
was
not
quiet
for
a
moment
glancing
from
the
rag
to
the
face
of
our
heroine
then
back
again
to
the
rag
that
his
suspicions
were
awakened
was
easy
to
be
seen
nor
was
he
long
in
letting
it
be
known
what
direction
they
had
taken
we
are
not
in
a
part
of
the
world
where
our
ensigns
and
gauds
ought
to
be
spread
abroad
to
the
wind
mabel
dunham
he
said
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
i
thought
as
much
myself
muir
and
brought
away
the
little
flag
lest
it
might
be
the
means
of
betraying
our
presence
here
to
the
enemy
even
though
nothing
is
intended
by
its
display
ought
not
my
uncle
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstance
i
no
see
the
necessity
for
that
pretty
mabel
for
as
you
justly
say
it
is
a
circumstance
and
circumstances
sometimes
worry
the
worthy
mariner
but
this
flag
if
flag
it
can
be
called
belongs
to
a
craft
you
may
perceive
that
it
is
made
of
what
is
called
bunting
and
that
is
a
description
of
cloth
used
only
by
vessels
for
such
purposes
colors
being
of
silk
as
you
may
understand
or
painted
canvas
it
surprisingly
like
the
fly
of
the
ensign
and
now
i
recollect
me
to
have
observed
that
a
piece
had
been
cut
from
that
very
mabel
felt
her
heart
sink
but
she
had
sufficient
not
to
attempt
an
answer
it
must
be
looked
to
muir
continued
and
after
all
i
think
it
may
be
well
to
hold
a
short
consultation
with
master
cap
than
whom
a
more
loyal
subject
does
not
exist
in
the
british
i
have
thought
the
warning
so
serious
mabel
rejoined
that
i
am
about
to
remove
to
the
blockhouse
and
to
take
the
woman
with
i
do
not
see
the
prudence
of
that
mabel
the
blockhouse
will
be
the
first
spot
assailed
should
there
really
be
an
attack
and
it
no
well
provided
for
a
siege
that
must
be
allowed
if
i
might
advise
in
so
delicate
a
contingency
i
would
recommend
your
taking
refuge
in
the
boat
which
as
you
may
now
perceive
is
most
favorably
placed
to
retreat
by
that
channel
opposite
where
all
in
it
would
be
hid
by
the
islands
in
one
or
two
minutes
water
leaves
no
trail
as
pathfinder
well
expresses
it
and
there
appears
to
be
so
many
different
passages
in
that
quarter
that
escape
would
be
more
than
probable
i
always
been
of
opinion
that
lundie
hazarded
too
much
in
occupying
a
post
so
far
advanced
and
so
much
exposed
as
it
too
late
to
regret
it
now
muir
and
we
have
only
to
consult
our
own
and
the
king
honor
pretty
mabel
yes
his
majesty
arms
and
his
glorious
name
are
not
to
be
overlooked
on
any
then
i
think
it
might
be
better
if
we
all
turned
our
eyes
towards
the
place
that
has
been
built
to
maintain
them
instead
of
the
boat
said
mabel
smiling
and
so
muir
i
am
for
the
blockhouse
intending
to
await
there
the
return
of
my
father
and
his
party
he
would
be
sadly
grieved
at
finding
we
had
fled
when
he
got
back
successful
himself
and
filled
with
the
confidence
of
our
having
been
as
faithful
to
our
duties
as
he
has
been
to
his
nay
nay
for
heaven
sake
do
not
misunderstand
me
mabel
muir
interrupted
with
some
alarm
of
manner
i
am
far
from
intimating
that
any
but
you
females
ought
to
take
refuge
in
the
boat
the
duty
of
us
men
is
sufficiently
plain
no
doubt
and
my
resolution
has
been
formed
from
the
first
to
stand
or
fall
by
the
and
did
you
imagine
muir
that
two
females
could
row
that
heavy
boat
in
a
way
to
escape
the
bark
canoe
of
an
indian
ah
my
pretty
mabel
love
is
seldom
logical
and
its
fears
and
misgivings
are
apt
to
warp
the
faculties
i
only
saw
your
sweet
person
in
the
possession
of
the
means
of
safety
and
overlooked
the
want
of
ability
to
use
them
but
you
not
be
so
cruel
lovely
creature
as
to
impute
to
me
as
a
fault
my
intense
anxiety
on
your
own
mabel
had
heard
enough
her
mind
was
too
much
occupied
with
what
had
passed
that
morning
and
with
her
fears
to
wish
to
linger
longer
to
listen
to
love
speeches
which
in
her
most
joyous
and
buoyant
moments
she
would
have
found
unpleasant
she
took
a
hasty
leave
of
her
companion
and
was
about
to
trip
away
towards
the
hilt
of
the
other
woman
when
muir
arrested
the
movement
by
laying
a
hand
on
her
arm
one
word
mabel
said
he
before
you
leave
me
this
little
flag
may
or
it
may
not
have
a
particular
meaning
if
it
has
now
that
we
are
aware
of
its
being
shown
may
it
not
be
better
to
put
it
back
again
while
we
watch
vigilantly
for
some
answer
that
may
betray
the
conspiracy
and
if
it
mean
nothing
why
nothing
will
this
may
be
all
right
muir
though
if
the
whole
is
accidental
the
flag
might
be
the
occasion
of
the
fort
being
mabel
stayed
to
utter
no
more
but
she
was
soon
out
of
sight
running
into
the
hut
towards
which
she
had
been
first
proceeding
the
quartermaster
remained
on
the
very
spot
and
in
the
precise
attitude
in
which
she
had
left
him
for
quite
a
minute
first
looking
at
the
bounding
figure
of
the
girl
and
then
at
the
bit
of
bunting
which
he
still
held
before
him
in
a
way
to
denote
indecision
his
irresolution
lasted
but
for
this
minute
however
for
he
was
soon
beneath
the
tree
where
he
fastened
the
mimic
flag
to
a
branch
again
though
from
his
ignorance
of
the
precise
spot
from
which
it
had
been
taken
by
mabel
he
left
it
fluttering
from
a
part
of
the
oak
where
it
was
still
more
exposed
than
before
to
the
eyes
of
any
passenger
on
the
river
though
less
in
view
from
the
island
itself
chapter
xxi
each
one
has
had
his
supping
mess
the
cheese
is
put
into
the
press
the
pans
and
bowls
clean
scalded
all
reared
up
against
the
wall
cotton
it
seemed
strange
to
mabel
dunham
as
she
passed
along
on
her
way
to
find
her
female
companion
that
others
should
be
so
composed
while
she
herself
felt
as
if
the
responsibilities
of
life
and
death
rested
on
her
shoulders
it
is
true
that
distrust
of
june
motives
mingled
with
her
forebodings
but
when
she
came
to
recall
the
affectionate
and
natural
manner
of
the
young
indian
girl
and
all
the
evidences
of
good
faith
and
sincerity
she
had
seen
in
her
conduct
during
the
familiar
intercourse
of
their
journey
she
rejected
the
idea
with
the
unwillingness
of
a
generous
disposition
to
believe
ill
of
others
she
saw
however
that
she
could
not
put
her
companions
properly
on
their
guard
without
letting
them
into
the
secret
of
her
conference
with
june
and
she
found
herself
compelled
to
act
cautiously
and
with
a
forethought
to
which
she
was
unaccustomed
more
especially
in
a
matter
of
so
much
moment
the
soldier
wife
was
told
to
transport
the
necessaries
into
the
blockhouse
and
admonished
not
to
be
far
from
it
at
any
time
during
the
day
mabel
did
not
explain
her
reasons
she
merely
stated
that
she
had
detected
some
signs
in
walking
about
the
island
which
induced
her
to
apprehend
that
the
enemy
had
more
knowledge
of
its
position
than
had
been
previously
believed
and
that
they
two
at
least
would
do
well
to
be
in
readiness
to
seek
a
refuge
at
the
shortest
notice
it
was
not
difficult
to
arouse
the
apprehension
of
this
person
who
though
a
scotchwoman
was
ready
enough
to
listen
to
anything
that
confirmed
her
dread
of
indian
cruelties
as
soon
as
mabel
believed
that
her
companion
was
sufficiently
frightened
to
make
her
wary
she
threw
out
some
hints
touching
the
inexpediency
of
letting
the
soldiers
know
the
extent
of
their
own
fears
this
was
done
with
a
view
to
prevent
discussions
and
inquiries
that
might
embarrass
our
heroine
she
determining
to
render
her
uncle
the
corporal
and
his
men
more
cautious
by
adopting
a
different
course
unfortunately
the
british
army
could
not
have
furnished
a
worse
person
for
the
particular
duty
that
he
was
now
required
to
discharge
than
corporal
the
individual
who
had
been
left
in
command
during
the
absence
of
sergeant
dunham
on
the
one
hand
he
was
resolute
prompt
familiar
with
all
the
details
of
a
soldier
life
and
used
to
war
on
the
other
he
was
supercilious
as
regards
the
provincials
opinionated
on
every
subject
connected
with
the
narrow
limits
of
his
professional
practice
much
disposed
to
fancy
the
british
empire
the
centre
of
all
that
is
excellent
in
the
world
and
scotland
the
focus
of
at
least
all
moral
excellence
in
that
empire
in
short
he
was
an
epitome
though
on
a
scale
suited
to
his
rank
of
those
very
qualities
which
were
so
peculiar
to
the
servants
of
the
crown
that
were
sent
into
the
colonies
as
these
servants
estimated
themselves
in
comparison
with
the
natives
of
the
country
or
in
other
words
he
considered
the
american
as
an
animal
inferior
to
the
parent
stock
and
viewed
all
his
notions
of
military
service
in
particular
as
undigested
and
absurd
a
more
impracticable
subject
therefore
could
not
well
have
offered
for
the
purpose
of
mabel
and
yet
she
felt
obliged
to
lose
no
time
in
putting
her
plan
in
execution
my
father
has
left
you
a
responsible
command
corporal
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
a
little
apart
for
should
the
island
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
not
only
should
we
be
captured
but
the
party
that
is
now
out
would
in
all
probability
become
their
prisoners
it
needs
no
journey
from
scotland
to
this
place
to
know
the
facts
needful
to
be
o
that
way
of
returned
drily
i
do
not
doubt
your
understanding
it
as
well
as
myself
but
i
fearful
that
you
veterans
accustomed
as
you
are
to
dangers
and
battles
are
a
little
apt
to
overlook
some
of
the
precautions
that
may
be
necessary
in
a
situation
as
peculiar
as
they
say
scotland
is
no
conquered
country
young
woman
but
thinking
there
must
be
some
mistak
in
the
matter
as
we
her
children
are
so
and
apt
to
be
when
we
least
expect
nay
my
good
friend
you
mistake
my
meaning
in
the
first
place
not
thinking
of
scotland
at
all
but
of
this
island
and
then
i
am
far
from
doubting
your
vigilance
when
you
think
it
necessary
to
practise
it
but
my
great
fear
is
that
there
may
be
danger
to
which
your
courage
will
make
you
my
courage
mistress
dunham
is
doubtless
of
a
very
pool
quality
being
nothing
but
scottish
courage
your
father
is
yankee
and
were
he
here
among
us
we
should
see
different
preparations
beyond
a
doubt
well
times
are
getting
wrang
when
foreigners
hold
commissions
and
carry
halberds
in
scottish
corps
and
i
no
wonder
that
battles
are
lost
and
campaigns
go
wrang
end
mabel
was
almost
in
despair
but
the
quiet
warning
of
june
was
still
too
vividly
impressed
on
her
mind
to
allow
her
to
yield
the
matter
she
changed
her
mode
of
operating
therefore
still
clinging
to
the
hope
of
getting
the
whole
party
within
the
blockhouse
without
being
compelled
to
betray
the
source
whence
she
obtained
her
notices
of
the
necessity
of
vigilance
i
daresay
you
are
right
corporal
she
observed
for
i
often
heard
of
the
heroes
of
your
country
who
have
been
among
the
first
of
the
civilized
world
if
what
they
tell
me
of
them
is
have
you
read
the
history
of
scotland
mistress
dunham
demanded
the
corporal
looking
up
at
his
pretty
companion
for
the
first
time
with
something
like
a
smile
on
his
hard
repulsive
countenance
i
have
read
a
little
of
it
corporal
but
i
heard
much
more
the
lady
who
brought
me
up
had
scottish
blood
in
her
veins
and
was
fond
of
the
i
warrant
ye
the
sergeant
no
troubled
himself
to
expatiate
on
the
renown
of
the
country
where
his
regiment
was
raised
my
father
has
other
things
to
think
of
and
the
little
i
know
was
got
from
the
lady
i
have
she
no
be
forgetting
to
tall
ye
o
wallace
of
him
i
even
read
a
good
and
o
bruce
and
the
affair
of
bannockburn
of
that
too
as
well
as
of
culloden
the
last
of
these
battles
was
then
a
recent
event
it
having
actually
been
fought
within
the
recollection
of
our
heroine
whose
notions
of
it
however
were
so
confused
that
she
scarcely
appreciated
the
effect
her
allusion
might
produce
on
her
companion
she
knew
it
had
been
a
victory
and
had
often
heard
the
guests
of
her
patroness
mention
it
with
triumph
and
she
fancied
their
feelings
would
find
a
sympathetic
chord
in
those
of
every
british
soldier
unfortunately
had
fought
throughout
that
luckless
day
on
the
side
of
the
pretender
and
a
deep
scar
that
garnished
his
face
had
been
left
there
by
the
sabre
of
a
german
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
house
of
hanover
he
fancied
that
his
wound
bled
afresh
at
mabel
allusion
and
it
is
certain
that
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
in
a
torrent
as
if
it
would
pour
out
of
his
skin
at
the
cicatrix
hoot
hoot
awa
he
fairly
shouted
with
your
culloden
and
sherriff
muirs
young
woman
ye
no
be
understanding
the
subject
at
all
and
will
manifest
not
only
wisdom
but
modesty
in
speaking
o
your
ain
country
and
its
many
failings
king
george
has
some
loyal
subjects
in
the
colonies
na
doubt
but
be
a
lang
time
before
he
sees
or
hears
any
guid
of
mabel
was
surprised
at
the
corporal
heat
for
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
where
the
shoe
pinched
but
she
was
determined
not
to
give
up
the
point
i
always
heard
that
the
scotch
had
two
of
the
good
qualities
of
soldiers
she
said
courage
and
circumspection
and
i
feel
persuaded
that
corporal
will
sustain
the
national
ask
yer
own
father
mistress
dunham
he
is
acquaint
with
corporal
and
will
no
be
backward
to
point
out
his
demerits
we
have
been
in
battle
thegither
and
he
is
my
superior
officer
and
has
a
sort
official
right
to
give
the
characters
of
his
my
father
thinks
well
of
you
or
he
would
not
have
left
you
in
charge
of
this
island
and
all
it
contains
his
own
daughter
included
among
other
things
i
well
know
that
he
calculates
largely
on
your
prudence
he
expects
the
blockhouse
in
particular
to
be
strictly
attended
if
he
wishes
to
defend
the
honor
of
the
behind
logs
he
ought
to
have
remained
in
command
himsel
for
to
speak
frankly
it
goes
against
a
scotchman
bluid
and
opinions
to
be
beaten
out
of
the
field
even
before
he
is
attacked
we
are
broadsword
men
and
love
to
stand
foot
to
foot
with
the
foe
this
american
mode
of
fighting
that
is
getting
into
so
much
favor
will
destroy
the
reputation
of
his
majesty
army
if
it
no
destroy
its
no
true
soldier
despises
caution
even
major
duncan
himself
than
whom
there
is
none
braver
is
celebrated
for
his
care
of
his
lundie
has
his
weakness
and
is
fast
forgetting
the
broadsword
and
open
heaths
in
his
tree
and
rifle
practice
but
mistress
dunham
tak
the
word
of
an
old
soldier
who
has
seen
his
year
when
he
talls
ye
that
there
is
no
surer
method
to
encourage
your
enemy
than
to
seem
to
fear
him
and
that
there
is
no
danger
in
this
indian
warfare
that
the
fancies
and
imaginations
of
your
americans
have
not
enlarged
upon
until
they
see
a
savage
in
every
bush
we
scots
come
from
a
naked
region
and
have
no
need
and
less
relish
for
covers
and
so
ye
be
seeing
mistress
dunham
the
corporal
gave
a
spring
into
the
air
fell
forward
on
his
face
and
rolled
over
on
his
back
the
whole
passing
so
suddenly
that
mabel
had
scarcely
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
the
rifle
that
had
sent
a
bullet
through
his
body
our
heroine
did
not
shriek
did
not
even
tremble
for
the
occurrence
was
too
sudden
too
awful
and
too
unexpected
for
that
exhibition
of
weakness
on
the
contrary
she
stepped
hastily
forward
with
a
natural
impulse
to
aid
her
companion
there
was
just
enough
of
life
left
in
to
betray
his
entire
consciousness
of
all
that
had
passed
his
countenance
had
the
wild
look
of
one
who
had
been
overtaken
by
death
by
surprise
and
mabel
in
her
cooler
moments
fancied
that
it
showed
the
tardy
repentance
of
a
willful
and
obstinate
sinner
ye
be
getting
into
the
blockhouse
as
fast
as
possible
whispered
as
mabel
leaned
over
him
to
catch
his
dying
words
then
came
over
our
heroine
the
full
consciousness
of
her
situation
and
of
the
necessity
of
exertion
she
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
the
body
at
her
feet
saw
that
it
had
ceased
to
breathe
and
fled
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
run
to
the
blockhouse
the
door
of
which
mabel
had
barely
gained
when
it
was
closed
violently
in
her
face
by
jennie
the
wife
who
in
blind
terror
thought
only
of
her
own
safety
the
reports
of
five
or
six
rifles
were
heard
while
mabel
was
calling
out
for
admittance
and
the
additional
terror
they
produced
prevented
the
woman
within
from
undoing
quickly
the
very
fastenings
she
had
been
so
expert
in
applying
after
a
minute
delay
however
mabel
found
the
door
reluctantly
yielding
to
her
constant
pressure
and
she
forced
her
slender
body
through
the
opening
the
instant
it
was
large
enough
to
allow
of
its
passage
by
this
time
mabel
heart
ceased
to
beat
tulmultuously
and
she
gained
sufficient
to
act
collectedly
instead
of
yielding
to
the
almost
convulsive
efforts
of
her
companion
to
close
the
door
again
she
held
it
open
long
enough
to
ascertain
that
none
of
her
own
party
was
in
sight
or
likely
on
the
instant
to
endeavor
to
gain
admission
then
she
allowed
the
opening
to
be
shut
her
orders
and
proceedings
now
became
more
calm
and
rational
but
a
single
bar
was
crossed
and
jennie
was
directed
to
stand
in
readiness
to
remove
even
that
at
any
application
from
a
friend
she
then
ascended
the
ladder
to
the
room
above
where
by
means
of
a
loophole
she
was
enabled
to
get
as
good
a
view
of
the
island
as
the
surrounding
bushes
would
allow
admonishing
her
associate
below
to
be
firm
and
steady
she
made
as
careful
an
examination
of
the
environs
as
her
situation
permitted
to
her
great
surprise
mabel
could
not
at
first
see
a
living
soul
on
the
island
friend
or
enemy
neither
frenchman
nor
indian
was
visible
though
a
small
straggling
white
cloud
that
was
floating
before
the
wind
told
her
in
which
quarter
she
ought
to
look
for
them
the
rifles
had
been
discharged
from
the
direction
of
the
island
whence
june
had
come
though
whether
the
enemy
were
on
that
island
or
had
actually
landed
on
her
own
mabel
could
not
say
going
to
the
loop
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
spot
where
lay
her
blood
curdled
at
perceiving
all
three
of
his
soldiers
lying
apparently
lifeless
at
his
side
these
men
had
rushed
to
a
common
centre
at
the
first
alarm
and
had
been
shot
down
almost
simultaneously
by
the
invisible
foe
whom
the
corporal
had
affected
to
despise
neither
cap
nor
lieutenant
muir
was
to
be
seen
with
a
beating
heart
mabel
examined
every
opening
through
the
trees
and
ascended
even
to
the
upper
story
or
garret
of
the
blockhouse
where
she
got
a
full
view
of
the
whole
island
so
far
as
its
covers
would
allow
but
with
no
better
success
she
had
expected
to
see
the
body
of
her
uncle
lying
on
the
grass
like
those
of
the
soldiers
but
it
was
nowhere
visible
turning
towards
the
spot
where
the
boat
lay
mabel
saw
that
it
was
still
fastened
to
the
shore
and
then
she
supposed
that
by
some
accident
muir
had
been
prevented
from
effecting
his
retreat
in
that
quarter
in
short
the
island
lay
in
the
quiet
of
the
grave
the
bodies
of
the
soldiers
rendering
the
scone
as
fearful
as
it
was
extraordinary
for
god
holy
sake
mistress
mabel
called
out
the
woman
from
below
for
though
her
fear
had
become
too
ungovernable
to
allow
her
to
keep
silence
our
heroine
superior
refinement
more
than
the
regimental
station
of
her
father
still
controlled
her
mode
of
address
mistress
mabel
tell
me
if
any
of
our
friends
are
living
i
think
i
hear
groans
that
grow
fainter
and
fainter
and
fear
that
they
will
all
be
tomahawked
mabel
now
remembered
that
one
of
the
soldiers
was
this
woman
husband
and
she
trembled
at
what
might
be
the
immediate
effect
of
her
sorrow
should
his
death
become
suddenly
known
to
her
the
groans
too
gave
a
little
hope
though
she
feared
they
might
come
from
her
uncle
who
lay
out
of
view
we
are
in
his
holy
keeping
jennie
she
answered
we
must
trust
in
providence
while
we
neglect
none
of
its
benevolent
means
of
protecting
ourselves
be
careful
with
the
door
on
no
account
open
it
without
my
oh
tell
me
mistress
mabel
if
you
can
anywhere
see
sandy
if
i
could
only
let
him
know
that
i
in
safety
the
guid
man
would
be
easier
in
his
mind
whether
free
or
a
sandy
was
jennie
husband
and
he
lay
dead
in
plain
view
of
the
loop
from
which
our
heroine
was
then
looking
you
no
tell
me
if
you
seeing
of
sandy
the
woman
repeated
from
below
impatient
at
mabel
silence
there
are
some
of
our
people
gathered
about
the
body
of
was
the
answer
for
it
seemed
sacrilegious
in
her
eyes
to
tell
a
direct
untruth
under
the
awful
circumstances
in
which
she
was
placed
is
sandy
amang
them
demanded
the
woman
in
a
voice
that
sounded
appalling
by
its
hoarseness
and
energy
he
may
be
certainly
for
i
see
one
two
three
four
and
all
in
the
scarlet
coats
of
the
sandy
called
out
the
woman
frantically
why
d
no
care
for
yoursal
sandy
come
hither
the
instant
man
and
share
your
fortunes
in
weal
or
woe
it
no
a
moment
for
your
silly
discipline
and
notions
of
honor
sandy
sandy
mabel
heard
the
bar
turn
and
then
the
door
creaked
on
its
hinges
expectation
not
to
say
terror
held
her
in
suspense
at
the
loop
and
she
soon
beheld
jennie
rushing
through
the
bushes
in
the
direction
of
the
cluster
of
the
dead
it
took
the
woman
but
an
instant
to
reach
the
fatal
spot
so
sudden
and
unexpected
had
been
the
blow
that
she
in
her
terror
did
not
appear
to
comprehend
its
weight
some
wild
and
notion
of
a
deception
troubled
her
fancy
and
she
imagined
that
the
men
were
trifling
with
her
fears
she
took
her
husband
hand
and
it
was
still
warm
while
she
thought
a
covert
smile
was
struggling
on
his
lip
why
will
ye
fool
life
away
sandy
she
cried
pulling
at
the
arm
ye
all
be
murdered
by
these
accursed
indians
and
you
no
to
the
block
like
trusty
soldiers
awa
awa
and
no
be
losing
the
precious
in
her
desperate
efforts
the
woman
pulled
the
body
of
her
husband
in
a
way
to
cause
the
head
to
turn
completely
over
when
the
small
hole
in
the
temple
caused
by
the
entrance
of
a
rifle
bullet
and
a
few
drops
of
blood
trickling
over
the
skin
revealed
the
meaning
of
her
silence
as
the
horrid
truth
flashed
in
its
full
extent
on
her
mind
the
woman
clasped
her
hands
gave
a
shriek
that
pierced
the
glades
of
every
island
near
and
fell
at
length
on
the
dead
body
of
the
soldier
thrilling
heartreaching
appalling
as
was
that
shriek
it
was
melody
to
the
cry
that
followed
it
so
quickly
as
to
blend
the
sounds
the
terrific
arose
out
of
the
covers
of
the
island
and
some
twenty
savages
horrible
in
their
paint
and
the
other
devices
of
indian
ingenuity
rushed
forward
eager
to
secure
the
coveted
scalps
arrowhead
was
foremost
and
it
was
his
tomahawk
that
brained
the
insensible
jennie
and
her
reeking
hair
was
hanging
at
his
girdle
as
a
trophy
in
less
than
two
minutes
after
she
had
quitted
the
blockhouse
his
companions
were
equally
active
and
and
his
soldiers
no
longer
presented
the
quiet
aspect
of
men
who
slumbered
they
were
left
in
their
gore
unequivocally
butchered
corpses
all
this
passed
in
much
less
time
than
has
been
required
to
relate
it
and
all
this
did
mabel
witness
she
had
stood
riveted
to
the
spot
gazing
on
the
whole
horrible
scene
as
if
enchained
by
some
charm
nor
did
the
idea
of
self
or
of
her
own
danger
once
obtrude
itself
on
her
thoughts
but
no
sooner
did
she
perceive
the
place
where
the
men
had
fallen
covered
with
savages
exulting
in
the
success
of
their
surprise
than
it
occurred
to
her
that
jennie
had
left
the
blockhouse
door
unbarred
her
heart
beat
violently
for
that
defence
alone
stood
between
her
and
immediate
death
and
she
sprang
toward
the
ladder
with
the
intention
of
descending
to
make
sure
of
it
her
foot
had
not
yet
reached
the
floor
of
the
second
story
however
when
she
heard
the
door
grating
on
its
hinges
and
she
gave
herself
up
for
lost
sinking
on
her
knees
the
terrified
but
courageous
girl
endeavored
to
prepare
herself
for
death
and
to
raise
her
thoughts
to
god
the
instinct
of
life
however
was
too
strong
for
prayer
and
while
her
lips
moved
the
jealous
senses
watched
every
sound
beneath
when
her
ears
heard
the
bars
which
went
on
pivots
secured
to
the
centre
of
the
door
turning
into
their
fastenings
not
one
as
she
herself
had
directed
with
a
view
to
admit
her
uncle
should
he
apply
but
all
three
she
started
again
to
her
feet
all
spiritual
contemplations
vanishing
in
her
actual
temporal
condition
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
her
faculties
were
absorbed
in
the
sense
of
hearing
the
thoughts
are
active
in
a
moment
so
fearful
at
first
mabel
fancied
that
her
uncle
had
entered
the
blockhouse
and
she
was
about
to
descend
the
ladder
and
throw
herself
into
his
arms
then
the
idea
that
it
might
be
an
indian
who
had
barred
the
door
to
shut
out
intruders
while
he
plundered
at
leisure
arrested
the
movement
the
profound
stillness
below
was
unlike
the
bold
restless
movements
of
cap
and
it
seemed
to
savor
more
of
the
artifices
of
an
enemy
if
a
friend
at
all
it
could
only
be
her
uncle
or
the
quartermaster
for
the
horrible
conviction
now
presented
itself
to
our
heroine
that
to
these
two
and
herself
were
the
whole
party
suddenly
reduced
if
indeed
the
two
latter
survived
this
consideration
held
mabel
in
check
and
for
full
two
minutes
more
a
breathless
silence
reigned
in
the
building
during
this
time
the
girl
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
upper
ladder
the
trap
which
led
to
the
lower
opening
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
floor
the
eyes
of
mabel
were
riveted
on
this
spot
for
she
now
began
to
expect
to
see
at
each
instant
the
horrible
sight
of
a
savage
face
at
the
hole
this
apprehension
soon
became
so
intense
that
she
looked
about
her
for
a
place
of
concealment
the
procrastination
of
the
catastrophe
she
now
fully
expected
though
it
were
only
for
a
moment
afforded
a
relief
the
room
contained
several
barrels
and
behind
two
of
these
mabel
crouched
placing
her
eyes
at
an
opening
by
which
she
could
still
watch
the
trap
she
made
another
effort
to
pray
but
the
moment
was
too
horrible
for
that
relief
she
thought
too
that
she
heard
a
low
rustling
as
if
one
were
ascending
the
lower
ladder
with
an
effort
at
caution
so
great
as
to
betray
itself
by
its
own
excess
then
followed
a
creaking
that
she
was
certain
came
from
one
of
the
steps
of
the
ladder
which
had
made
the
same
noise
under
her
own
light
weight
as
she
ascended
this
was
one
of
those
instants
into
which
are
compressed
the
sensations
of
years
of
ordinary
existence
life
death
eternity
and
extreme
bodily
pain
were
all
standing
out
in
bold
relief
from
the
plane
of
occurrences
and
she
might
have
been
taken
at
that
moment
for
a
beautiful
pallid
representation
of
herself
equally
without
motion
and
without
vitality
but
while
such
was
the
outward
appearance
of
the
form
never
had
there
been
a
time
in
her
brief
career
when
mabel
heard
more
acutely
saw
more
clearly
or
felt
more
vividly
as
yet
nothing
was
visible
at
the
trap
but
her
ears
rendered
exquisitely
sensitive
by
intense
feeling
distinctly
acquainted
her
that
some
one
was
within
a
few
inches
of
the
opening
in
the
floor
next
followed
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
which
beheld
the
dark
hair
of
an
indian
rising
so
slowly
through
the
passage
that
the
movements
of
the
head
might
be
likened
to
that
of
the
of
a
clock
then
came
the
dark
skin
and
wild
features
until
the
whole
of
the
swarthy
face
had
risen
above
the
floor
the
human
countenance
seldom
appears
to
advantage
when
partially
concealed
and
mabel
imagined
many
additional
horrors
as
she
first
saw
the
black
roving
eyes
and
the
expression
of
wildness
as
the
savage
countenance
was
revealed
as
it
might
be
inch
by
inch
but
when
the
entire
head
was
raised
above
the
floor
a
second
and
a
better
look
assured
our
heroine
that
she
saw
the
gentle
anxious
and
even
handsome
face
of
june
chapter
xxii
spectre
though
i
be
i
am
not
sent
to
scare
thee
or
deceive
but
in
reward
of
thy
fidelity
wordsworth
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
evinced
the
most
satisfaction
when
mabel
sprang
to
her
feet
and
appeared
in
the
centre
of
the
room
our
heroine
on
finding
that
her
visitor
was
the
wife
of
arrowhead
and
not
arrowhead
himself
or
june
at
discovering
that
her
advice
had
been
followed
and
that
the
blockhouse
contained
the
person
she
had
so
anxiously
and
almost
hopelessly
sought
they
embraced
each
other
and
the
unsophisticated
tuscarora
woman
laughed
in
her
sweet
accents
as
she
held
her
friend
at
arm
length
and
made
certain
of
her
presence
blockhouse
good
said
the
young
indian
got
no
it
is
indeed
good
june
mabel
answered
with
a
shudder
veiling
her
eyes
at
the
same
time
as
if
to
shut
out
a
view
of
the
horrors
she
had
so
lately
witnessed
tell
me
for
god
sake
if
you
know
what
has
become
of
my
dear
uncle
i
have
looked
in
all
directions
without
being
able
to
see
no
here
in
blockhouse
june
asked
with
some
curiosity
indeed
he
is
not
i
am
quite
alone
in
this
place
jennie
the
woman
who
was
with
me
having
rushed
out
to
join
her
husband
and
perishing
for
her
june

bad

if
my
poor
uncle

on
the
shore
but
neither
my

nor
the

anywhere
to
be
no
kill
or
june
would
see
hide
away
red
man
hide
no
shame
for
it
is
not
the
shame
that
i
fear
for
them
but
the
opportunity
your
attack
was
awfully
sudden
june
tuscarora
returned
the
other
smiling
with
exultation
at
the
dexterity
of
her
husband
arrowhead
great
warrior
you
are
too
good
and
gentle
for
this
sort
of
life
june
you
can
not
be
happy
in
such
scenes
june
countenance
grew
clouded
and
mabel
fancied
there
was
some
of
the
savage
fire
of
a
chief
in
her
frown
as
she
answered
yengeese
too
greedy
take
away
all
chase
six
nation
from
morning
to
night
wicked
king
wicked
people
very
mabel
knew
that
even
in
that
distant
day
there
was
much
truth
in
this
opinion
though
she
was
too
well
instructed
not
to
understand
that
the
monarch
in
this
as
in
a
thousand
other
cases
was
blamed
for
acts
of
which
he
was
most
probably
ignorant
she
felt
the
justice
of
the
rebuke
therefore
too
much
to
attempt
an
answer
and
her
thoughts
naturally
reverted
to
her
own
situation
and
what
am
i
to
do
june
she
demanded
it
can
not
be
long
before
your
people
will
assault
this
blockhouse
good
got
no
but
they
will
soon
discover
that
it
has
got
no
garrison
too
if
they
do
not
know
it
already
you
yourself
told
me
the
number
of
people
that
were
on
the
island
and
doubtless
you
learned
it
from
arrowhead
know
answered
june
holding
up
six
fingers
to
indicate
the
number
of
the
men
all
red
men

four

of
it
june
the
horrid
thought
curdles
my
blood
your
people
can
not
know
that
i
am
alone
in
the
blockhouse
but
may
fancy
my
uncle
and
the
quartermaster
with
me
and
may
set
fire
to
the
building
in
order
to
dislodge
them
they
tell
me
that
fire
is
the
great
danger
to
such
no

until

daughter
tell
best
when
fader
come
mabel
felt
uneasy
at
the
glance
of
june
dark
eye
as
she
uttered
this
for
the
unpleasant
surmise
arose
that
her
companion
was
endeavoring
to
discover
a
fact
that
might
be
useful
to
her
own
people
while
it
would
lead
to
the
destruction
of
her
parent
and
his
party
she
was
about
to
make
an
evasive
answer
when
a
heavy
push
at
the
outer
door
suddenly
drew
all
her
thoughts
to
the
immediate
danger
they
come
she
exclaimed
perhaps
june
it
is
my
uncle
or
the
quartermaster
i
can
not
keep
out
even
muir
at
a
moment
like
why
no
look
plenty
loophole
made
mabel
took
the
hint
and
going
to
one
of
the
downward
loops
that
had
been
cut
through
the
logs
in
the
part
that
overhung
the
basement
she
cautiously
raised
the
little
block
that
ordinarily
filled
the
small
hole
and
caught
a
glance
at
what
was
passing
at
the
door
the
start
and
changing
countenance
told
her
companion
that
some
of
her
own
people
were
below
red
man
said
june
lifting
a
finger
in
admonition
to
be
prudent
four
and
horrible
in
their
paint
and
bloody
trophies
arrowhead
is
among
june
had
moved
to
a
corner
where
several
spare
rifles
had
been
deposited
and
had
already
taken
one
into
her
hand
when
the
name
of
her
husband
appeared
to
arrest
her
movements
it
was
but
for
an
instant
however
for
she
immediately
went
to
the
loop
and
was
about
to
thrust
the
muzzle
of
the
piece
through
it
when
a
feeling
of
natural
aversion
induced
mabel
to
seize
her
arm
no
no
no
june
said
the
latter
not
against
your
own
husband
though
my
life
be
the
no
hurt
arrowhead
returned
june
with
a
slight
shudder
no
hurt
red
man
at
all
no
fire
at
only
mabel
now
comprehended
the
intention
of
june
and
no
longer
opposed
it
the
latter
thrust
the
muzzle
of
the
rifle
through
the
loophole
and
taking
care
to
make
noise
enough
to
attract
attraction
she
pulled
the
trigger
the
piece
had
no
sooner
been
discharged
than
mabel
reproached
her
friend
for
the
very
act
that
was
intended
to
serve
her
you
declared
it
was
not
your
intention
to
fire
she
said
and
you
may
have
destroyed
your
own
all
run
away
before
i
fire
returned
june
laughing
and
going
to
another
loop
to
watch
the
movements
of
her
friends
laughing
still
heartier
see
get
cover
every
warrior
think
saltwater
and
quartermaster
here
take
good
care
heaven
be
praised
and
now
june
i
may
hope
for
a
little
time
to
compose
my
thoughts
to
prayer
that
i
may
not
die
like
jennie
thinking
only
of
life
and
the
things
of
the
june
laid
aside
the
rifle
and
came
and
seated
herself
near
the
box
on
which
mabel
had
sunk
under
that
physical
reaction
which
accompanies
joy
as
well
as
sorrow
she
looked
steadily
in
our
heroine
face
and
the
latter
thought
that
her
countenance
had
an
expression
of
severity
mingled
with
its
concern
arrowhead
great
warrior
said
the
tuscarora
wife
all
the
girls
of
tribe
look
at
him
much
the
beauty
has
eyes
too
june
what
do
these
words
that
look
imply
what
would
you
say
why
you
so
june
shoot
arrowhead
would
it
not
have
been
horrible
to
see
a
wife
destroy
her
own
husband
no
june
rather
would
i
have
died
very
sure
dat
all
that
was
all
june
as
god
is
my
judge
and
surely
that
was
enough
no
no
there
have
been
sufficient
horrors
without
increasing
them
by
an
act
like
this
what
other
motive
can
you
suspect
do
know
poor
tuscarora
girl
very
foolish
arrowhead
great
chief
and
look
all
round
him
talk
of
beauty
in
his
sleep
great
chief
like
many
can
a
chief
possess
more
than
one
wife
june
among
your
people
have
as
many
as
he
can
keep
great
hunter
marry
often
arrowhead
got
only
june
now
but
he
look
too
much
see
too
much
talk
too
much
of
mabel
was
conscious
of
this
fact
which
had
distressed
her
not
a
little
in
the
course
of
their
journey
but
it
shocked
her
to
hear
this
allusion
coming
as
it
did
from
the
mouth
of
the
wife
herself
she
knew
that
habit
and
opinions
made
great
differences
in
such
matters
but
in
addition
to
the
pain
and
mortification
she
experienced
at
being
the
unwilling
rival
of
a
wife
she
felt
an
apprehension
that
jealousy
would
be
but
an
equivocal
guarantee
for
her
personal
safety
in
her
present
situation
a
closer
look
at
june
however
reassured
her
for
while
it
was
easy
to
trace
in
the
unpractised
features
of
this
unsophisticated
being
the
pain
of
blighted
affections
no
distrust
could
have
tortured
the
earnest
expression
of
her
honest
countenance
into
that
of
treachery
or
hate
you
will
not
betray
me
june
mabel
said
pressing
the
other
hand
and
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
generous
confidence
you
will
not
give
up
one
of
your
own
sex
to
the
tomahawk
no
tomahawk
touch
you
arrowhead
no
let
if
june
must
have
love
to
have
no
june
my
religion
my
feelings
both
forbid
it
and
if
i
could
be
the
wife
of
an
indian
at
all
i
would
never
take
the
place
that
is
yours
in
a
june
made
no
answer
but
she
looked
gratified
and
even
grateful
she
knew
that
few
perhaps
no
indian
girl
within
the
circle
of
acquaintance
could
compare
with
herself
in
personal
attractions
and
though
it
might
suit
her
husband
to
marry
a
dozen
wives
she
knew
of
no
one
beside
mabel
whose
influence
she
could
really
dread
so
keen
an
interest
however
had
she
taken
in
the
beauty
winning
manners
kindness
and
feminine
gentleness
of
our
heroine
that
when
jealousy
came
to
chill
these
feelings
it
had
rather
lent
strength
to
that
interest
and
under
its
wayward
influence
had
actually
been
one
of
the
strongest
of
the
incentives
that
had
induced
her
to
risk
so
much
in
order
to
save
her
imaginary
rival
from
the
consequences
of
the
attack
that
she
so
well
knew
was
about
to
take
place
in
a
word
june
with
a
wife
keenness
of
perception
had
detected
arrowhead
admiration
of
mabel
and
instead
of
feeling
that
harrowing
jealousy
that
might
have
rendered
her
rival
hateful
as
would
have
been
apt
to
be
the
case
with
a
woman
unaccustomed
to
defer
to
the
superior
rights
of
the
lordly
sex
she
had
studied
the
looks
and
character
of
the
beauty
until
meeting
with
nothing
to
repel
her
own
feelings
but
everything
to
encourage
them
she
had
got
to
entertain
an
admiration
and
love
for
her
which
though
certainly
very
different
was
scarcely
less
strong
than
that
of
her
husband
arrowhead
himself
had
sent
her
to
warn
mabel
of
the
coming
danger
though
he
was
ignorant
that
she
had
stolen
upon
the
island
in
the
rear
of
the
assailants
and
was
now
intrenched
in
the
citadel
along
with
the
object
of
their
joint
care
on
the
contrary
he
supposed
as
his
wife
had
said
that
cap
and
muir
were
in
the
blockhouse
with
mabel
and
that
the
attempt
to
repel
him
and
his
companions
had
been
made
by
the
men
june
sorry
the
lily
for
so
the
indian
in
her
poetical
language
had
named
our
heroine
june
sorry
the
lily
no
marry
arrowhead
his
wigwam
big
and
a
great
chief
must
get
wives
enough
to
fill
i
thank
you
june
for
this
preference
which
is
not
according
to
the
notion
of
us
white
women
returned
mabel
smiling
in
spite
of
the
fearful
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
but
i
may
not
probably
never
shall
marry
at
must
have
good
husband
said
june
marry
if
do
like
june
this
is
not
a
fit
subject
for
a
girl
who
scarcely
knows
if
she
is
to
live
another
hour
or
not
i
would
obtain
some
signs
of
my
dear
uncle
being
alive
and
safe
if
june
go
can
you
will
you
would
it
be
safe
for
you
to
be
seen
on
the
island
is
your
presence
known
to
the
warriors
and
would
they
be
pleased
to
find
a
woman
on
the
with
them
all
this
mabel
asked
in
rapid
connection
fearing
that
the
answer
might
not
be
as
she
wished
she
had
thought
it
extraordinary
that
june
should
be
of
the
party
and
improbable
as
it
seemed
she
had
fancied
that
the
woman
had
covertly
followed
the
iroquois
in
her
own
canoe
and
had
got
in
their
advance
merely
to
give
her
the
notice
which
had
probably
saved
her
life
but
in
all
this
she
was
mistaken
as
june
in
her
imperfect
manner
now
found
means
to
let
her
know
arrowhead
though
a
chief
was
in
disgrace
with
his
own
people
and
was
acting
with
the
iroquois
temporarily
though
with
a
perfect
understanding
he
had
a
wigwam
it
is
true
but
was
seldom
in
it
feigning
friendship
for
the
english
he
had
passed
the
summer
ostensibly
in
their
service
while
he
was
in
truth
acting
for
the
french
and
his
wife
journeyed
with
him
in
his
many
migrations
most
of
the
distances
being
passed
over
in
canoes
in
a
word
her
presence
was
no
secret
her
husband
seldom
moving
without
her
enough
of
this
to
embolden
mabel
to
wish
that
her
friend
might
go
out
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
her
uncle
did
june
succeed
in
letting
the
other
know
and
it
was
soon
settled
between
them
that
the
indian
woman
should
quit
the
blockhouse
with
that
object
the
moment
a
favorable
opportunity
offered
they
first
examined
the
island
as
thoroughly
as
their
position
would
allow
from
the
different
loops
and
found
that
its
conquerors
were
preparing
for
a
feast
having
seized
upon
the
provisions
of
the
english
and
rifled
the
huts
most
of
the
stores
were
in
the
blockhouse
but
enough
were
found
outside
to
reward
the
indians
for
an
attack
that
had
been
attended
by
so
little
risk
a
party
had
already
removed
the
dead
bodies
and
mabel
saw
that
their
arms
were
collected
in
a
pile
near
the
spot
chosen
for
the
banquet
june
suggested
that
by
some
signs
which
she
understood
the
dead
themselves
were
carried
into
a
thicket
and
either
buried
or
concealed
from
view
none
of
the
more
prominent
objects
on
the
island
however
were
disturbed
it
being
the
desire
of
the
conquerors
to
lure
the
party
of
the
sergeant
into
an
ambush
on
its
return
june
made
her
companion
observe
a
man
in
a
tree
a
as
she
said
to
give
timely
notice
of
the
approach
of
any
boat
although
the
departure
of
the
expedition
being
so
recent
nothing
but
some
unexpected
event
would
be
likely
to
bring
it
back
so
soon
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
intention
to
attack
the
blockhouse
immediately
but
every
indication
as
understood
by
june
rather
showed
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
indians
to
keep
it
besieged
until
the
return
of
the
sergeant
party
lest
the
signs
of
an
assault
should
give
a
warning
to
eyes
as
practised
as
those
of
pathfinder
the
boat
however
had
been
secured
and
was
removed
to
the
spot
where
the
canoes
of
the
indians
were
hid
in
the
bushes
june
now
announced
her
intention
to
join
her
friends
the
moment
being
particularly
favorable
for
her
to
quit
the
blockhouse
mabel
felt
some
distrust
as
they
descended
the
ladder
but
at
the
next
instant
she
was
ashamed
of
the
feeling
as
unjust
to
her
companion
and
unworthy
of
herself
and
by
the
time
they
both
stood
on
the
ground
her
confidence
was
restored
the
process
of
unbarring
the
door
was
conducted
with
the
utmost
caution
and
when
the
last
bar
was
ready
to
be
turned
june
took
her
station
near
the
spot
where
the
opening
must
necessarily
be
the
bar
was
just
turned
free
of
the
brackets
the
door
was
opened
merely
wide
enough
to
allow
her
body
to
pass
and
june
glided
through
the
space
mabel
closed
the
door
again
with
a
convulsive
movement
and
as
the
bar
turned
into
its
place
her
heart
beat
audibly
she
then
felt
secure
and
the
two
other
bars
were
turned
down
in
a
more
deliberate
manner
when
all
was
fast
again
she
ascended
to
the
first
floor
where
alone
she
could
get
a
glimpse
of
what
was
going
on
without
long
and
painfully
melancholy
hours
passed
during
which
mabel
had
no
intelligence
from
june
she
heard
the
yells
of
the
savages
for
liquor
had
carried
them
beyond
the
bounds
of
precaution
and
occasionally
caught
glimpses
of
their
mad
orgies
through
the
loops
and
at
all
times
was
conscious
of
their
fearful
presence
by
sounds
and
sights
that
would
have
chilled
the
blood
of
one
who
had
not
so
lately
witnessed
scenes
so
much
more
terrible
toward
the
middle
of
the
day
she
fancied
she
saw
a
white
man
on
the
island
though
his
dress
and
wild
appearance
at
first
made
her
take
him
for
a
savage
a
view
of
his
face
although
it
was
swarthy
naturally
and
much
darkened
by
exposure
left
no
doubt
that
her
conjecture
was
true
and
she
felt
as
if
there
was
now
one
of
a
species
more
like
her
own
present
and
one
to
whom
she
might
appeal
for
succor
in
the
last
emergency
mabel
little
knew
alas
how
small
was
the
influence
exercised
by
the
whites
over
their
savage
allies
when
the
latter
had
begun
to
taste
of
blood
or
how
slight
indeed
was
the
disposition
to
divert
them
from
their
cruelties
the
day
seemed
a
month
by
mabel
computation
and
the
only
part
of
it
that
did
not
drag
were
the
minutes
spent
in
prayer
she
had
recourse
to
this
relief
from
time
to
time
and
at
each
effort
she
found
her
spirit
firmer
her
mind
more
tranquil
and
her
resignation
more
confirmed
she
understood
the
reasoning
of
june
and
believed
it
highly
probable
that
the
blockhouse
would
be
left
unmolested
until
the
return
of
her
father
in
order
to
entice
him
into
an
ambuscade
and
she
felt
much
less
apprehension
of
immediate
danger
in
consequence
but
the
future
offered
little
ground
of
hope
and
her
thoughts
had
already
begun
to
calculate
the
chances
of
her
captivity
at
such
moments
arrowhead
and
his
offensive
admiration
filled
a
prominent
place
in
the
background
for
our
heroine
well
knew
that
the
indians
usually
carried
off
to
their
villages
for
the
purposes
of
adoption
such
captives
as
they
did
not
slay
and
that
many
instances
had
occurred
in
which
individuals
of
her
sex
had
passed
the
remainder
of
their
lives
in
the
wigwams
of
their
conquerors
such
thoughts
as
these
invariably
drove
her
to
her
knees
and
to
her
prayers
while
the
light
lasted
the
situation
of
our
heroine
was
sufficiently
alarming
but
as
the
shades
of
evening
gradually
gathered
over
the
island
it
became
fearfully
appalling
by
this
time
the
savages
had
wrought
themselves
up
to
the
point
of
fury
for
they
had
possessed
themselves
of
all
the
liquor
of
the
english
and
their
outcries
and
gesticulations
were
those
of
men
truly
possessed
by
evil
spirits
all
the
efforts
of
their
french
leader
to
restrain
them
were
entirely
fruitless
and
he
had
wisely
withdrawn
to
an
adjacent
island
where
he
had
a
sort
of
bivouac
that
he
might
keep
at
a
safe
distance
from
friends
so
apt
to
run
into
excesses
before
quitting
the
spot
however
this
officer
at
great
risk
to
his
own
life
had
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
fire
and
in
securing
the
ordinary
means
to
relight
it
this
precaution
he
took
lest
the
indians
should
burn
the
blockhouse
the
preservation
of
which
was
necessary
to
the
success
of
his
future
plans
he
would
gladly
have
removed
all
the
arms
also
but
this
he
found
impracticable
the
warriors
clinging
to
their
knives
and
tomahawks
with
the
tenacity
of
men
who
regarded
a
point
of
honor
as
long
as
a
faculty
was
left
and
to
carry
off
the
rifles
and
leave
behind
him
the
very
weapons
that
were
generally
used
on
such
occasions
would
have
been
an
idle
expedient
the
extinguishing
of
the
fire
proved
to
be
the
most
prudent
measure
for
no
sooner
was
the
officer
back
turned
than
one
of
the
warriors
in
fact
proposed
to
fire
the
blockhouse
arrowhead
had
also
withdrawn
from
the
group
of
drunkards
as
soon
as
he
found
that
they
were
losing
their
senses
and
had
taken
possession
of
a
hut
where
he
had
thrown
himself
on
the
straw
and
sought
the
rest
that
two
wakeful
and
watchful
nights
had
rendered
necessary
it
followed
that
no
one
was
left
among
the
indians
to
care
for
mabel
if
indeed
any
knew
of
her
existence
at
all
and
the
proposal
of
the
drunkard
was
received
with
yells
of
delight
by
eight
or
ten
more
as
much
intoxicated
and
habitually
as
brutal
as
himself
this
was
the
fearful
moment
for
mabel
the
indians
in
their
present
condition
were
reckless
of
any
rifles
that
the
blockhouse
might
hold
though
they
did
retain
dim
recollections
of
its
containing
living
beings
an
additional
incentive
to
their
enterprise
and
they
approached
its
base
whooping
and
leaping
like
demons
as
yet
they
were
excited
not
overcome
by
the
liquor
they
had
drunk
the
first
attempt
was
made
at
the
door
against
which
they
ran
in
a
body
but
the
solid
structure
which
was
built
entirely
of
logs
defied
their
efforts
the
rush
of
a
hundred
men
with
the
same
object
would
have
been
useless
this
mabel
however
did
not
know
and
her
heart
seemed
to
leap
into
her
mouth
as
she
heard
the
heavy
shock
at
each
renewed
effort
at
length
when
she
found
that
the
door
resisted
these
assaults
as
if
it
were
of
stone
neither
trembling
nor
yielding
and
only
betraying
its
not
being
a
part
of
the
wall
by
rattling
a
little
on
its
heavy
hinges
her
courage
revived
and
she
seized
the
first
moment
of
a
cessation
to
look
down
through
the
loop
in
order
if
possible
to
learn
the
extent
of
her
danger
a
silence
for
which
it
was
not
easy
to
account
stimulated
her
curiosity
for
nothing
is
so
alarming
to
those
who
are
conscious
of
the
presence
of
imminent
danger
as
to
be
unable
to
trace
its
approach
mabel
found
that
two
or
three
of
the
iroquois
had
been
raking
the
embers
where
they
had
found
a
few
small
coals
and
with
these
they
were
endeavoring
to
light
a
fire
the
interest
with
which
they
labored
the
hope
of
destroying
and
the
force
of
habit
enabled
them
to
act
intelligently
and
in
unison
so
long
as
their
fell
object
was
kept
in
view
a
white
man
would
have
abandoned
the
attempt
to
light
a
fire
in
despair
with
coals
that
came
out
of
the
ashes
resembling
sparks
but
these
children
of
the
forest
had
many
expedients
that
were
unknown
to
civilization
by
the
aid
of
a
few
dry
leaves
which
they
alone
knew
where
to
seek
a
blaze
was
finally
kindled
and
then
the
addition
of
a
few
light
sticks
made
sure
of
the
advantage
that
had
been
obtained
when
mabel
stooped
down
over
the
loop
the
indians
were
making
a
pile
of
brush
against
the
door
and
as
she
remained
gazing
at
their
proceedings
she
saw
the
twigs
ignite
the
flame
dart
from
branch
to
branch
until
the
whole
pile
was
cracking
and
snapping
under
a
bright
blaze
the
indians
now
gave
a
yell
of
triumph
and
returned
to
their
companions
well
assured
that
the
work
of
destruction
was
commenced
mabel
remained
looking
down
scarcely
able
to
tear
herself
away
from
the
spot
so
intense
and
engrossing
was
the
interest
she
felt
in
the
progress
of
the
fire
as
the
pile
kindled
throughout
however
the
flames
mounted
until
they
flashed
so
near
her
eyes
as
to
compel
her
to
retreat
just
as
she
reached
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
to
which
she
had
retired
in
her
alarm
a
forked
stream
shot
up
through
the
loophole
the
lid
of
which
she
had
left
open
and
illuminated
the
rude
apartment
with
mabel
and
her
desolation
our
heroine
now
naturally
enough
supposed
that
her
hour
was
come
for
the
door
the
only
means
of
retreat
had
been
blocked
up
by
the
brush
and
fire
with
hellish
ingenuity
and
she
addressed
herself
as
she
believed
for
the
last
time
to
her
maker
in
prayer
her
eyes
were
closed
and
for
more
than
a
minute
her
spirit
was
abstracted
but
the
interests
of
the
world
too
strongly
divided
her
feelings
to
be
altogether
suppressed
and
when
they
involuntarily
opened
again
she
perceived
that
the
streak
of
flame
was
no
longer
flaring
in
the
room
though
the
wood
around
the
little
aperture
had
kindled
and
the
blaze
was
slowly
mounting
under
the
impulsion
of
a
current
of
air
that
sucked
inward
a
barrel
of
water
stood
in
a
corner
and
mabel
acting
more
by
instinct
than
by
reason
caught
up
a
vessel
filled
it
and
pouring
it
on
the
wood
with
a
trembling
hand
succeeded
in
extinguishing
the
fire
at
that
particular
spot
the
smoke
prevented
her
from
looking
down
again
for
a
couple
of
minutes
but
when
she
did
her
heart
beat
high
with
delight
and
hope
at
finding
that
the
pile
of
blazing
brush
had
been
overturned
and
scattered
and
that
water
had
been
thrown
on
the
logs
of
the
door
which
were
still
smoking
though
no
longer
burning
who
is
there
said
mabel
with
her
mouth
at
the
loop
what
friendly
hand
has
a
merciful
providence
sent
to
my
succor
a
light
footstep
was
audible
below
and
one
of
those
gentle
pushes
at
the
door
was
heard
which
just
moved
the
massive
beams
on
the
hinges
who
wishes
to
enter
is
it
you
dear
dear
uncle
saltwater
no
here
lawrence
sweet
water
was
the
answer
open
quick
want
to
come
the
step
of
mabel
was
never
lighter
or
her
movements
more
quick
and
natural
than
while
she
was
descending
the
ladder
and
turning
the
bars
for
all
her
motions
were
earnest
and
active
this
time
she
thought
only
of
her
escape
and
she
opened
the
door
with
a
rapidity
which
did
not
admit
of
caution
her
first
impulse
was
to
rush
into
the
open
air
in
the
blind
hope
of
quitting
the
blockhouse
but
june
repulsed
the
attempt
and
entering
she
coolly
barred
the
door
again
before
she
would
notice
mabel
eager
efforts
to
embrace
her
bless
you
bless
you
june
cried
our
heroine
most
fervently
you
are
sent
by
providence
to
be
my
guardian
angel
no
hug
so
tight
answered
the
tuscarora
woman
woman
all
cry
or
all
laugh
let
june
fasten
mabel
became
more
rational
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
were
again
in
the
upper
room
seated
as
before
hand
in
hand
all
feeling
of
distrust
between
them
being
banished
now
tell
me
june
mabel
commenced
as
soon
as
she
had
given
and
received
one
warm
embrace

june
turned
her
dark
eyes
quietly
on
mabel
and
for
a
moment
her
look
was
stern
though
it
was
soon
changed
into
one
of
melancholy
compassion
lily
yengeese
girl
she
said
as
one

a
question

mabel
pressing

lily
and
put
it
in
my
mabel
melted
into
tears
and
she
pressed
the
affectionate
creature
to
her
heart
it
was
near
a
minute
before
she
could
renew
the
discourse
but
then
she
succeeded
in
speaking
more
calmly
and
with
greater
coherence
let

not
several
canoes
on
the
island
might
i
not
get
one
and
go
and
give
my
father
notice
of
what
has
happened
know
how
to
paddle
demanded
june
glancing
her
eye
furtively
at
her
companion
not
so
well
as
yourself
perhaps
but
enough
to
get
out
of
sight
before
what
do
then
could
paddle
six
ten
eight
mile
i
do
not
know
i
would
do
much
to
warn
my
father
and
the
excellent
pathfinder
and
all
the
rest
of
the
danger
they
are
like
pathfinder
all
like
him
who
know
him
you
would
like
him
nay
love
him
if
you
only
knew
his
heart
no
like
him
at
all
too
good
rifle
too
good
eye
too
much
shoot
iroquois
and
june
people
must
get
his
scalp
if
and
i
must
save
it
if
i
can
june
in
this
respect
then
we
are
opposed
to
each
other
i
will
go
and
find
a
canoe
the
instant
they
are
all
asleep
and
quit
the
no
can
june
wo
let
you
call
june
you
would
not
betray
me
you
could
not
give
me
up
after
all
you
have
done
for
me
just
so
returned
june
making
a
backward
gesture
with
her
hand
and
speaking
with
a
warmth
and
earnestness
mabel
had
never
witnessed
in
her
before
call
arrowhead
in
loud
voice
one
call
from
wife
wake
a
warrior
up
june
no
let
lily
help
enemy
no
let
indian
hurt
i
understand
you
june
and
feel
the
nature
and
justice
of
your
sentiments
and
after
all
it
were
better
that
i
should
remain
here
for
i
have
most
probably
overrated
my
strength
but
tell
me
one
thing
if
my
uncle
comes
in
the
night
and
asks
to
be
admitted
you
will
let
me
open
the
door
of
the
blockhouse
that
he
may
enter
sartain
he
prisoner
here
and
june
like
prisoner
better
than
scalp
scalp
good
for
honor
prisoner
good
for
feeling
but
saltwater
hide
so
close
he
do
know
where
he
be
here
june
laughed
in
her
girlish
mirthful
way
for
to
her
scenes
of
violence
were
too
familiar
to
leave
impressions
sufficiently
deep
to
change
her
natural
character
a
long
and
discursive
dialogue
now
followed
in
which
mabel
endeavored
to
obtain
clearer
notions
of
her
actual
situation
under
a
faint
hope
that
she
might
possibly
be
enabled
to
turn
some
of
the
facts
she
thus
learned
to
advantage
june
answered
all
her
interrogatories
simply
but
with
a
caution
which
showed
she
fully
distinguished
between
that
which
was
immaterial
and
that
which
might
endanger
the
safety
or
embarrass
the
future
operations
of
her
friends
the
substance
of
the
information
she
gave
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
arrowhead
had
long
been
in
communication
with
the
french
though
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
he
had
entirely
thrown
aside
the
mask
he
no
longer
intended
to
trust
himself
among
the
english
for
he
had
discovered
traces
of
distrust
particularly
in
pathfinder
and
with
indian
bravado
he
now
rather
wished
to
blazon
than
to
conceal
his
treachery
he
had
led
the
party
of
warriors
in
the
attack
on
the
island
subject
however
to
the
supervision
of
the
frenchman
who
has
been
mentioned
though
june
declined
saying
whether
he
had
been
the
means
of
discovering
the
position
of
a
place
which
had
been
thought
to
be
so
concealed
from
the
enemy
or
not
on
this
point
she
would
say
nothing
but
she
admitted
that
she
and
her
husband
had
been
watching
the
departure
of
the
at
the
time
they
were
overtaken
and
captured
by
the
cutter
the
french
had
obtained
their
information
of
the
precise
position
of
the
station
but
very
recently
and
mabel
felt
a
pang
when
she
thought
that
there
were
covert
allusions
of
the
indian
woman
which
would
convey
the
meaning
that
the
intelligence
had
come
from
a
in
the
employment
of
duncan
of
lundie
this
was
intimated
however
rather
than
said
and
when
mabel
had
time
to
reflect
on
her
words
she
found
room
to
hope
that
she
had
misunderstood
her
and
that
jasper
western
would
yet
come
out
of
the
affair
freed
from
every
injurious
imputation
june
did
not
hesitate
to
confess
that
she
had
been
sent
to
the
island
to
ascertain
the
precise
number
and
the
occupations
of
those
who
had
been
left
on
it
though
she
also
betrayed
in
her
way
that
the
wish
to
serve
mabel
had
induced
her
principally
to
consent
to
come
in
consequence
of
her
report
and
information
otherwise
obtained
the
enemy
was
aware
of
precisely
the
force
that
could
be
brought
against
them
they
also
knew
the
number
of
men
who
had
gone
with
sergeant
dunham
and
were
acquainted
with
the
object
he
had
in
view
though
they
were
ignorant
of
the
spot
where
he
expected
to
meet
the
french
boats
it
would
have
been
a
pleasant
sight
to
witness
the
eager
desire
of
each
of
these
two
sincere
females
to
ascertain
all
that
might
be
of
consequence
to
their
respective
friends
and
yet
the
native
delicacy
with
which
each
refrained
from
pressing
the
other
to
make
revelations
which
would
have
been
improper
as
well
as
the
sensitive
almost
intuitive
feeling
with
which
each
avoided
saying
aught
that
might
prove
injurious
to
her
own
nation
as
respects
each
other
there
was
perfect
confidence
as
regarded
their
respective
people
entire
fidelity
june
was
quite
as
anxious
as
mabel
could
be
on
any
other
point
to
know
where
the
sergeant
had
gone
and
when
he
was
expected
to
return
but
she
abstained
from
putting
the
question
with
a
delicacy
that
would
have
done
honor
to
the
highest
civilization
nor
did
she
once
frame
any
other
inquiry
in
a
way
to
lead
indirectly
to
a
betrayal
of
the
information
on
that
particular
point
though
when
mabel
of
her
own
accord
touched
on
any
matter
that
might
by
possibility
throw
a
light
on
the
subject
she
listened
with
an
intentness
which
almost
suspended
respiration
in
this
manner
the
hours
passed
away
unheeded
for
both
were
too
much
interested
to
think
of
rest
nature
asserted
her
rights
however
towards
morning
and
mabel
was
persuaded
to
lie
down
on
one
of
the
straw
beds
provided
for
the
soldiers
where
she
soon
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
june
lay
near
her
and
a
quiet
reigned
on
the
whole
island
as
profound
as
if
the
dominion
of
the
forest
had
never
been
invaded
by
man
when
mabel
awoke
the
light
of
the
sun
was
streaming
in
through
the
loopholes
and
she
found
that
the
day
was
considerably
advanced
june
still
lay
near
her
sleeping
as
tranquilly
as
if
she
reposed
on
we
will
not
say
down
for
the
superior
civilization
of
our
own
times
repudiates
the
simile
but
on
a
french
mattress
and
as
profoundly
as
if
she
had
never
experienced
concern
the
movements
of
mabel
notwithstanding
soon
awakened
one
so
accustomed
to
vigilance
and
then
the
two
took
a
survey
of
what
was
passing
around
them
by
means
of
the
friendly
apertures
chapter

his

blind
and

nature
chearing
every
kinde
the
tranquillity
of
the
previous
night
was
not
contradicted
by
the
movements
of
the
day
although
mabel
and
june
went
to
every
loophole
not
a
sign
of
the
presence
of
a
living
being
on
the
island
was
at
first
to
be
seen
themselves
excepted
there
was
a
smothered
fire
on
the
spot
where
and
his
comrades
had
cooked
as
if
the
smoke
which
curled
upwards
from
it
was
intended
as
a
lure
to
the
absent
and
all
around
the
huts
had
been
restored
to
former
order
and
arrangement
mabel
started
involuntarily
when
her
eye
at
length
fell
on
a
group
of
three
men
dressed
in
the
scarlet
of
the
seated
on
the
grass
in
lounging
attitudes
as
if
they
chatted
in
listless
security
and
her
blood
curdled
as
on
a
second
look
she
traced
the
bloodless
faces
and
glassy
eyes
of
the
dead
they
were
very
near
the
blockhouse
so
near
indeed
as
to
have
been
overlooked
at
the
first
eager
inquiry
and
there
was
a
mocking
levity
in
their
postures
and
gestures
for
their
limbs
were
stiffening
in
different
attitudes
intended
to
resemble
life
at
which
the
soul
revolted
still
horrible
as
these
objects
were
to
those
near
enough
to
discover
the
frightful
discrepancy
between
their
assumed
and
their
real
characters
the
arrangement
had
been
made
with
so
much
art
that
it
would
have
deceived
a
negligent
observer
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
after
carefully
examining
the
shores
of
the
island
june
pointed
out
to
her
companion
the
fourth
soldier
seated
with
his
feet
hanging
over
the
water
his
back
fastened
to
a
sapling
and
holding
a
in
his
hand
the
scalpless
heads
were
covered
with
the
caps
and
all
appearance
of
blood
had
been
carefully
washed
from
each
countenance
mabel
sickened
at
this
sight
which
not
only
did
so
much
violence
to
all
her
notions
of
propriety
but
which
was
in
itself
so
revolting
and
so
opposed
to
natural
feeling
she
withdrew
to
a
seat
and
hid
her
face
in
her
apron
for
several
minutes
until
a
low
call
from
june
again
drew
her
to
a
loophole
the
latter
then
pointed
out
the
body
of
jennie
seemingly
standing
in
the
door
of
a
hut
leaning
forward
as
if
to
look
at
the
group
of
men
her
cap
fluttering
in
the
wind
and
her
hand
grasping
a
broom
the
distance
was
too
great
to
distinguish
the
features
very
accurately
but
mabel
fancied
that
the
jaw
had
been
depressed
as
if
to
distort
the
mouth
into
a
sort
of
horrible
laugh
june
june
she
exclaimed
this
exceeds
all
i
have
ever
heard
or
imagined
as
possible
in
the
treachery
and
artifices
of
your
tuscarora
very
cunning
said
june
in
a
way
to
show
that
she
rather
approved
of
than
condemned
the
uses
to
which
the
dead
bodies
had
been
applied
do
soldier
no
harm
now
do
iroquois
good
got
the
scalp
first
now
make
bodies
work
by
and
by
burn
this
speech
told
mabel
how
far
she
was
separated
from
her
friend
in
character
and
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
could
again
address
her
but
this
temporary
aversion
was
lost
on
june
who
set
about
preparing
their
simple
breakfast
in
a
way
to
show
how
insensible
she
was
to
feelings
in
others
which
her
own
habits
taught
her
to
discard
mabel
ate
sparingly
and
her
companion
as
if
nothing
had
happened
then
they
had
leisure
again
for
their
thoughts
and
for
further
surveys
of
the
island
our
heroine
though
devoured
with
a
feverish
desire
to
be
always
at
the
loops
seldom
went
that
she
did
not
immediately
quit
them
in
disgust
though
compelled
by
her
apprehensions
to
return
again
in
a
few
minutes
called
by
the
rustling
of
leaves
or
the
sighing
of
the
wind
it
was
indeed
a
solemn
thing
to
look
out
upon
that
deserted
spot
peopled
by
the
dead
in
the
panoply
of
the
living
and
thrown
into
the
attitudes
and
acts
of
careless
merriment
and
rude
enjoyment
the
effect
on
our
heroine
was
much
as
if
she
had
found
herself
an
observer
of
the
revelries
of
demons
throughout
the
livelong
day
not
an
indian
nor
a
frenchman
was
to
be
seen
and
night
closed
over
the
frightful
but
silent
masquerade
with
the
steady
and
unalterable
progress
with
which
the
earth
obeys
her
laws
indifferent
to
the
petty
actors
and
petty
scenes
that
are
in
daily
bustle
and
daily
occurrence
on
her
bosom
the
night
was
far
more
quiet
than
that
which
had
preceded
it
and
mabel
slept
with
an
increasing
confidence
for
she
now
felt
satisfied
that
her
own
fate
would
not
be
decided
until
the
return
of
her
father
the
following
day
he
was
expected
however
and
when
our
heroine
awoke
she
ran
eagerly
to
the
loops
in
order
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
weather
and
the
aspect
of
the
skies
as
well
as
the
condition
of
the
island
there
lounged
the
fearful
group
on
the
grass
the
fisherman
still
hung
over
the
water
seemingly
intent
on
his
sport
and
the
distorted
countenance
of
jennie
glared
from
out
the
hut
in
horrible
contortions
but
the
weather
had
changed
the
wind
blew
fresh
from
the
southward
and
though
the
air
was
bland
it
was
filled
with
the
elements
of
storm
this
grows
more
and
more
difficult
to
bear
june
mabel
said
when
she
left
the
window
i
could
even
prefer
to
see
the
enemy
than
to
look
any
longer
on
this
fearful
array
of
the
hush
here
they
come
june
thought
hear
a
cry
like
a
warrior
shout
when
he
take
a
what
mean
you
there
is
no
more
butchery
there
can
be
no
saltwater
exclaimed
june
laughing
as
she
stood
peeping
through
a
loophole
my
dear
uncle
thank
god
he
then
lives
oh
june
june
will
not
let
them
harm
june
poor
squaw
what
warrior
of
what
she
say
arrowhead
bring
him
by
this
time
mabel
was
at
a
loop
and
sure
enough
there
were
cap
and
the
quartermaster
in
the
hands
of
the
indians
eight
or
ten
of
whom
were
conducting
them
to
the
foot
of
the
block
for
by
this
capture
the
enemy
now
well
knew
that
there
could
be
no
man
in
the
building
mabel
scarcely
breathed
until
the
whole
party
stood
ranged
directly
before
the
door
when
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
the
french
officer
was
among
them
a
low
conversation
followed
in
which
both
the
white
leader
and
arrowhead
spoke
earnestly
to
their
captives
when
the
quartermaster
called
out
to
her
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
be
heard
pretty
mabel
pretty
mabel
said
he
look
out
of
one
of
the
loopholes
and
pity
our
condition
we
are
threatened
with
instant
death
unless
you
open
the
door
to
the
conquerors
relent
then
or
we
no
be
wearing
our
scalps
half
an
hour
from
this
blessed
mabel
thought
there
were
mockery
and
levity
in
this
appeal
and
its
manner
rather
fortified
than
weakened
her
resolution
to
hold
the
place
as
long
as
possible
speak
to
me
uncle
said
she
with
her
mouth
at
a
loop
and
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
thank
god
thank
god
ejaculated
cap
the
sound
of
your
sweet
voice
magnet
lightens
my
heart
of
a
heavy
load
for
i
feared
you
had
shared
the
fate
of
poor
jennie
my
breast
has
felt
the
last
hours
as
if
a
ton
of
kentledge
had
been
stowed
in
it
you
ask
me
what
you
ought
to
do
child
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
advise
you
though
you
are
my
own
sister
daughter
the
most
i
can
say
just
now
my
poor
girl
is
most
heartily
to
curse
the
day
you
or
i
ever
saw
this
bit
of
fresh
but
uncle
is
your
life
in
danger
do
think
i
ought
to
open
the
door
a
round
turn
and
two
make
a
fast
belay
and
i
would
counsel
no
one
who
is
out
of
the
hands
of
these
devils
to
unbar
or
unfasten
anything
in
order
to
fall
into
them
as
to
the
quartermaster
and
myself
we
are
both
elderly
men
and
not
of
much
account
to
mankind
in
general
as
honest
pathfinder
would
say
and
it
can
make
no
great
odds
to
him
whether
he
balances
the
purser
books
this
year
or
the
next
and
as
for
myself
why
if
i
were
on
the
seaboard
i
should
know
what
to
do
but
up
here
in
this
watery
wilderness
i
can
only
say
that
if
i
were
behind
that
bit
of
a
bulwark
it
would
take
a
good
deal
of
indian
logic
to
rouse
me
out
of
you
no
be
minding
all
your
uncle
says
pretty
mabel
put
in
muir
for
distress
is
obviously
fast
unsettling
his
faculties
and
he
is
far
from
calculating
all
the
necessities
of
the
emergency
we
are
in
the
hands
here
of
very
considerate
and
gentlemanly
pairsons
it
must
be
acknowledged
and
one
has
little
occasion
to
apprehend
disagreeable
violence
the
casualties
that
have
occurred
are
the
common
incidents
of
war
and
can
no
change
our
sentiments
of
the
enemy
for
they
are
far
from
indicating
that
any
injustice
will
be
done
the
prisoners
i
sure
that
neither
master
cap
nor
myself
has
any
cause
of
complaint
since
we
have
given
ourselves
up
to
master
arrowhead
who
reminds
me
of
a
roman
or
a
spartan
by
his
virtues
and
moderation
but
ye
be
remembering
that
usages
differ
and
that
our
scalps
may
be
lawful
sacrifices
to
appease
the
manes
of
fallen
foes
unless
you
save
them
by
i
shall
do
wiser
to
keep
within
the
blockhouse
until
the
fate
of
the
island
is
settled
returned
mabel
our
enemies
can
feel
no
concern
on
account
of
one
like
me
knowing
that
i
can
do
them
no
harm
and
i
greatly
prefer
to
remain
here
as
more
befitting
my
sex
and
if
nothing
but
your
convenience
were
concerned
mabel
we
should
all
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
your
wishes
but
these
gentlemen
fancy
that
the
work
will
aid
their
operations
and
they
have
a
strong
desire
to
possess
it
to
be
frank
with
you
finding
myself
and
your
uncle
in
a
very
peculiar
situation
i
acknowledge
that
to
avert
consequences
i
have
assumed
the
power
that
belongs
to
his
majesty
commission
and
entered
into
a
verbal
capitulation
by
which
i
have
engaged
to
give
up
the
blockhouse
and
the
whole
island
it
is
the
fortune
of
war
and
must
be
submitted
to
so
open
the
door
pretty
mabel
forthwith
and
confide
yourself
to
the
care
of
those
who
know
how
to
treat
beauty
and
virtue
in
distress
there
no
courtier
in
scotland
more
complaisant
than
this
chief
or
who
is
more
familiar
with
the
laws
of
no
leave
blockhouse
muttered
june
who
stood
at
mabel
side
attentive
to
all
that
passed
blockhouse
good
got
no
our
heroine
might
have
yielded
but
for
this
appeal
for
it
began
to
appear
to
her
that
the
wisest
course
would
be
to
conciliate
the
enemy
by
concessions
instead
of
exasperating
them
by
resistance
they
must
know
that
muir
and
her
uncle
were
in
their
power
that
there
was
no
man
in
the
building
and
she
fancied
they
might
proceed
to
batter
down
the
door
or
cut
their
way
through
the
logs
with
axes
if
she
obstinately
refused
to
give
them
peaceable
admission
since
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
to
dread
the
rifle
but
the
words
of
june
induced
her
to
hesitate
and
the
earnest
pressure
of
the
hand
and
entreating
looks
of
her
companion
strengthened
a
resolution
that
was
faltering
no
prisoner
yet
whispered
june
let
make
prisoner
before
take
prisoner
talk
big
june
manage
mabel
now
began
to
parley
more
resolutely
with
muir
for
her
uncle
seemed
disposed
to
quiet
his
conscience
by
holding
his
tongue
and
she
plainly
intimated
that
it
was
not
her
intention
to
yield
the
building
you
forget
the
capitulation
mistress
mabel
said
muir
the
honor
of
one
of
his
majesty
servants
is
concerned
and
the
honor
of
his
majesty
through
his
servant
you
will
remember
the
finesse
and
delicacy
that
belong
to
military
honor
i
know
enough
muir
to
understand
that
you
have
no
command
in
this
expedition
and
therefore
can
have
no
right
to
yield
the
blockhouse
and
i
remember
moreover
to
have
heard
my
dear
father
say
that
a
prisoner
loses
all
his
authority
for
the
time
rank
sophistry
pretty
mabel
and
treason
to
the
king
as
well
as
dishonoring
his
commission
and
discrediting
his
name
you
no
be
persevering
in
your
intentions
when
your
better
judgment
has
had
leisure
to
reflect
and
to
make
conclusions
on
matters
and
ay
put
in
cap
this
is
a
circumstance
and
be
d
d
to
it
no
mind
uncle
say
ejaculated
june
who
was
occupied
in
a
far
corner
of
the
room
blockhouse
good
got
no
i
shall
remain
as
i
am
muir
until
i
get
some
tidings
of
my
father
he
will
return
in
the
course
of
the
next
ten
ah
mabel
this
artifice
will
no
deceive
the
enemy
who
by
means
that
would
be
unintelligible
did
not
our
suspicions
rest
on
an
unhappy
young
man
with
too
much
plausibility
are
familiar
with
all
our
doings
and
plans
and
well
know
that
the
sun
will
not
set
before
the
worthy
sergeant
and
his
companions
will
be
in
their
power
aweel
submission
to
providence
is
truly
a
christian
virtue
mr
muir
you
appear
to
be
deceived
in
the
strength
of
this
work
and
to
fancy
it
weaker
than
it
is
do
you
desire
to
see
what
i
can
do
in
the
way
of
defence
if
so
disposed
i
dinna
mind
if
i
do
answered
the
quartermaster
who
always
grew
scotch
as
he
grew
interested
what
do
you
think
of
that
then
look
at
the
loop
of
the
upper
story
as
soon
as
mabel
had
spoken
all
eyes
were
turned
upward
and
beheld
the
muzzle
of
a
rifle
cautiously
thrust
through
a
hole
june
having
resorted
again
to
a
which
had
already
proved
so
successful
the
result
did
not
disappoint
expectation
no
sooner
did
the
indians
catch
a
sight
of
the
fatal
weapon
than
they
leaped
aside
and
in
less
than
a
minute
every
man
among
them
had
sought
a
cover
the
french
officer
kept
his
eye
on
the
barrel
of
the
piece
in
order
to
ascertain
that
it
was
not
pointed
in
his
particular
direction
and
he
coolly
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
as
neither
muir
nor
cap
had
anything
to
apprehend
from
the
quarter
in
which
the
others
were
menaced
they
kept
their
ground
be
wise
my
pretty
mabel
be
wise
exclaimed
the
former
and
no
be
provoking
useless
contention
in
the
name
of
all
the
kings
of
albin
who
have
ye
closeted
with
you
in
that
wooden
tower
that
seemeth
so
there
is
necromancy
about
this
matter
and
all
our
characters
may
be
involved
in
the
what
do
you
think
of
the
pathfinder
master
muir
for
a
garrison
to
so
strong
a
post
cried
mabel
resorting
to
an
equivocation
which
the
circumstances
rendered
very
excusable
what
will
your
french
and
indian
companions
think
of
the
aim
of
the
pathfinder
rifle
bear
gently
on
the
unfortunate
pretty
mabel
and
do
not
confound
the
king
servants
may
heaven
bless
him
and
all
his
royal
lineage
with
the
king
enemies
if
pathfinder
be
indeed
in
the
blockhouse
let
him
speak
and
we
will
hold
our
negotiations
directly
with
him
he
knows
us
as
friends
and
we
fear
no
evil
at
his
hands
and
least
of
all
to
myself
for
a
generous
mind
is
apt
to
render
rivalry
in
a
certain
interest
a
sure
ground
of
respect
and
amity
since
admiration
of
the
same
woman
proves
a
community
of
feeling
and
the
reliance
on
pathfinder
friendship
did
not
extend
beyond
the
quartermaster
and
cap
however
for
even
the
french
officer
who
had
hitherto
stood
his
ground
so
well
shrank
back
at
the
sound
of
the
terrible
name
so
unwilling
indeed
did
this
individual
a
man
of
iron
nerves
and
one
long
accustomed
to
the
dangers
of
the
peculiar
warfare
in
which
he
was
engaged
appear
to
remain
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
killdeer
whose
reputation
throughout
all
that
frontier
was
as
well
established
as
that
of
marlborough
in
europe
that
he
did
not
disdain
to
seek
a
cover
insisting
that
his
two
prisoners
should
follow
him
mabel
was
too
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
enemies
to
lament
the
departure
of
her
friends
though
she
kissed
her
hand
to
cap
through
the
loop
and
called
out
to
him
in
terms
of
affection
as
he
moved
slowly
and
unwillingly
away
the
enemy
now
seemed
disposed
to
abandon
all
attempts
on
the
blockhouse
for
the
present
and
june
who
had
ascended
to
a
trap
in
the
roof
whence
the
best
view
was
to
be
obtained
reported
that
the
whole
party
had
assembled
to
eat
on
a
distant
and
sheltered
part
of
the
island
where
muir
and
cap
were
quietly
sharing
in
the
good
things
which
were
going
as
if
they
had
no
concern
on
their
minds
this
information
greatly
relieved
mabel
and
she
began
to
turn
her
thoughts
again
to
the
means
of
effecting
her
own
escape
or
at
least
of
letting
her
father
know
of
the
danger
that
awaited
him
the
sergeant
was
expected
to
return
that
afternoon
and
she
knew
that
a
moment
gained
or
lost
might
decide
his
fate
three
or
four
hours
flew
by
the
island
was
again
buried
in
a
profound
quiet
the
day
was
wearing
away
and
yet
mabel
had
decided
on
nothing
june
was
in
the
basement
preparing
their
frugal
meal
and
mabel
herself
had
ascended
to
the
roof
which
was
provided
with
a
trap
that
allowed
her
to
go
out
on
the
top
of
the
building
whence
she
commanded
the
best
view
of
surrounding
objects
that
the
island
possessed
still
it
was
limited
and
much
obstructed
by
the
tops
of
trees
the
anxious
girl
did
not
dare
to
trust
her
person
in
sight
knowing
well
that
the
unrestrained
passions
of
some
savage
might
induce
him
to
send
a
bullet
through
her
brain
she
merely
kept
her
head
out
of
the
trap
therefore
whence
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
she
made
as
many
surveys
of
the
different
channels
about
the
island
as
anne
sister
anne
took
of
the
environs
of
the
castle
of
blue
beard
the
sun
had
actually
set
no
intelligence
had
been
received
from
the
boats
and
mabel
ascended
to
the
roof
to
take
a
last
look
hoping
that
the
party
would
arrive
in
the
darkness
which
would
at
least
prevent
the
indians
from
rendering
their
ambuscade
so
fatal
as
it
might
otherwise
prove
and
which
possibly
might
enable
her
to
give
some
more
intelligible
signal
by
means
of
fire
than
it
would
otherwise
be
in
her
power
to
do
her
eye
had
turned
carefully
round
the
whole
horizon
and
she
was
just
on
the
point
of
drawing
in
her
person
when
an
object
that
struck
her
as
new
caught
her
attention
the
islands
lay
grouped
so
closely
that
six
or
eight
different
channels
or
passages
between
them
were
in
view
and
in
one
of
the
most
covered
concealed
in
a
great
measure
by
the
bushes
of
the
shore
lay
what
a
second
look
assured
her
was
a
bark
canoe
it
contained
a
human
being
beyond
a
question
confident
that
if
an
enemy
her
signal
could
do
no
harm
and
if
a
friend
that
it
might
do
good
the
eager
girl
waved
a
little
flag
towards
the
stranger
which
she
had
prepared
for
her
father
taking
care
that
it
should
not
be
seen
from
the
island
mabel
had
repeated
her
signal
eight
or
ten
times
in
vain
and
she
began
to
despair
of
its
being
noticed
when
a
sign
was
given
in
return
by
the
wave
of
a
paddle
and
the
man
so
far
discovered
himself
as
to
let
her
see
it
was
chingachgook
here
then
at
last
was
a
friend
one
too
who
was
able
and
she
doubted
not
would
be
willing
to
aid
her
from
that
instant
her
courage
and
her
spirits
revived
the
mohican
had
seen
her
must
have
recognized
her
as
he
knew
that
she
was
of
the
party
and
no
doubt
as
soon
as
it
was
sufficiently
dark
he
would
take
the
steps
necessary
to
release
her
that
he
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
enemy
was
apparent
by
the
great
caution
he
observed
and
she
had
every
reliance
on
his
prudence
and
address
the
principal
difficulty
now
existed
with
june
for
mabel
had
seen
too
much
of
her
fidelity
to
her
own
people
relieved
as
it
was
by
sympathy
for
herself
to
believe
she
would
consent
to
a
hostile
indian
entering
the
blockhouse
or
indeed
to
her
leaving
it
with
a
view
to
defeat
arrowhead
plans
the
which
succeeded
the
discovery
of
the
presence
of
the
great
serpent
was
the
most
painful
of
mabel
dunham
life
she
saw
the
means
of
effecting
all
she
wished
as
it
might
be
within
reach
of
her
hand
and
yet
it
eluded
her
grasp
she
knew
june
decision
and
coolness
notwithstanding
all
her
gentleness
and
womanly
feeling
and
at
last
she
came
reluctantly
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
attaining
her
end
than
by
deceiving
her
tried
companion
and
protector
it
was
revolting
to
one
so
sincere
and
natural
so
pure
of
heart
and
so
much
disposed
to
ingenuousness
as
mabel
dunham
to
practise
deception
on
a
friend
like
june
but
her
own
father
life
was
at
stake
her
companion
would
receive
no
positive
injury
and
she
had
feelings
and
interests
directly
touching
herself
which
would
have
removed
greater
scruples
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
mabel
heart
began
to
beat
with
increased
violence
and
she
adopted
and
changed
her
plan
of
proceeding
at
least
a
dozen
times
in
a
single
hour
june
was
always
the
source
of
her
greatest
embarrassment
for
she
did
not
well
see
first
how
she
was
to
ascertain
when
chingachgook
was
at
the
door
where
she
doubted
not
he
would
soon
appear
and
secondly
how
she
was
to
admit
him
without
giving
the
alarm
to
her
watchful
companion
time
pressed
however
for
the
mohican
might
come
and
go
away
again
unless
she
was
ready
to
receive
him
it
would
be
too
hazardous
to
the
delaware
to
remain
long
on
the
island
and
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
determine
on
some
course
even
at
the
risk
of
choosing
one
that
was
indiscreet
after
running
over
various
projects
in
her
mind
therefore
mabel
came
to
her
companion
and
said
with
as
much
calmness
as
she
could
assume
are
you
not
afraid
june
now
your
people
believe
pathfinder
is
in
the
blockhouse
that
they
will
come
and
try
to
set
it
on
fire
no
such
no
burn
blockhouse
blockhouse
good
got
no
june
we
can
not
know
they
hid
because
they
believed
what
i
told
them
of
pathfinder
being
with
believe

fear
come
quick
go
quick
fear
make
run
away
wit

come
back
fear
make
warrior
fool
as
well
as
young
here
june
laughed
as
her
sex
is
apt
to
laugh
when
anything
particularly
ludicrous
crosses
their
youthful
fancies
i
feel
uneasy
june
and
wish
you
yourself
would
go
up
again
to
the
roof
and
look
out
upon
the
island
to
make
certain
that
nothing
is
plotting
against
us
you
know
the
signs
of
what
your
people
intend
to
do
better
than
june
go
lily
wish
but
very
well
know
that

when

and
go
on

never

sleep
god
send
it
may
be
so
but
go
up
dear
june
and
look
well
about
you
danger
may
come
when
we
least
expect
june
arose
and
prepared
to
ascend
to
the
roof
but
she
paused
with
her
foot
on
the
first
round
of
the
ladder
mabel
heart
beat
so
violently
that
she
was
fearful
its
throbs
would
be
heard
and
she
fancied
that
some
gleamings
of
her
real
intentions
had
crossed
the
mind
of
her
friend
she
was
right
in
part
the
indian
woman
having
actually
stopped
to
consider
whether
there
was
any
indiscretion
in
what
she
was
about
to
do
at
first
the
suspicion
that
mabel
intended
to
escape
flashed
across
her
mind
then
she
rejected
it
on
the
ground
that
the
had
no
means
of
getting
off
the
island
and
that
the
blockhouse
was
much
the
most
secure
place
she
could
find
the
next
thought
was
that
mabel
had
detected
some
sign
of
the
near
approach
of
her
father
this
idea
too
lasted
but
an
instant
for
june
entertained
some
such
opinion
of
her
companion
ability
to
understand
symptoms
of
this
sort
symptoms
that
had
escaped
her
own
sagacity
as
a
woman
of
high
fashion
entertains
of
the
accomplishments
of
her
maid
nothing
else
in
the
same
way
offering
she
began
slowly
to
mount
the
ladder
just
as
she
reached
the
upper
floor
a
lucky
thought
suggested
itself
to
our
heroine
and
by
expressing
it
in
a
hurried
but
natural
manner
she
gained
a
great
advantage
in
executing
her
projected
scheme
i
will
go
down
she
said
and
listen
by
the
door
june
while
you
are
on
the
roof
and
we
will
thus
be
on
our
guard
at
the
same
time
above
and
though
june
thought
this
savored
of
unnecessary
caution
well
knowing
that
no
one
could
enter
the
building
unless
aided
from
within
nor
any
serious
danger
menace
them
from
the
exterior
without
giving
sufficient
warning
she
attributed
the
proposition
to
mabel
ignorance
and
alarm
and
as
it
was
made
apparently
with
frankness
it
was
received
without
distrust
by
these
means
our
heroine
was
enabled
to
descend
to
the
door
as
her
friend
ascended
to
the
roof
the
distance
between
the
two
was
now
too
great
to
admit
of
conversation
and
for
three
or
four
minutes
one
was
occupied
in
looking
about
her
as
well
as
the
darkness
would
allow
and
the
other
in
listening
at
the
door
with
as
much
intentness
as
if
all
her
senses
were
absorbed
in
the
single
faculty
of
hearing
june
discovered
nothing
from
her
elevated
stand
the
obscurity
indeed
almost
forbade
the
hope
of
such
a
result
but
it
would
not
be
easy
to
describe
the
sensation
with
which
mabel
thought
she
perceived
a
slight
and
guarded
push
against
the
door
fearful
that
all
might
not
be
as
she
wished
and
anxious
to
let
chingachgook
know
that
she
was
near
she
began
though
in
tremulous
and
low
notes
to
sing
so
profound
was
the
stillness
of
the
moment
that
the
sound
of
the
unsteady
warbling
ascended
to
the
roof
and
in
a
minute
june
began
to
descend
a
slight
tap
at
the
door
was
heard
immediately
after
mabel
was
bewildered
for
there
was
no
time
to
lose
hope
proved
stronger
than
fear
and
with
unsteady
hands
she
commenced
unbarring
the
door
the
moccasin
of
june
was
heard
on
the
floor
above
her
when
only
a
single
bar
was
turned
the
second
was
released
as
her
form
reached
down
the
lower
ladder
what
you
do
exclaimed
june
angrily
run
away
mad
leave
blockhouse
blockhouse
the
hands
of
both
were
on
the
last
bar
and
it
would
have
been
cleared
from
the
fastenings
but
for
a
vigorous
shove
from
without
which
jammed
the
wood
a
short
struggle
ensued
though
both
were
disinclined
to
violence
june
would
probably
have
prevailed
had
not
another
and
a
more
vigorous
push
from
without
forced
the
bar
past
the
trifling
impediment
that
held
it
when
the
door
opened
the
form
of
a
man
was
seen
to
enter
and
both
the
females
rushed
up
the
ladder
as
if
equally
afraid
of
the
consequences
the
stranger
secured
the
door
and
first
examining
the
lower
room
with
great
care
he
cautiously
ascended
the
ladder
june
as
soon
as
it
became
dark
had
closed
the
loops
of
the
principal
floor
and
lighted
a
candle
by
means
of
this
dim
taper
then
the
two
females
stood
in
expectation
waiting
to
ascertain
the
person
of
their
visitor
whose
wary
ascent
of
the
ladder
was
distinctly
audible
though
sufficiently
deliberate
it
would
not
be
easy
to
say
which
was
the
more
astonished
on
finding
when
the
stranger
had
got
through
the
trap
that
pathfinder
stood
before
them
god
be
praised
mabel
exclaimed
for
the
idea
that
the
blockhouse
would
be
impregnable
with
such
a
garrison
at
once
crossed
her
mind
o
pathfinder
what
has
become
of
my
father
the
sergeant
is
safe
as
yet
and
victorious
though
it
is
not
in
the
gift
of
man
to
say
what
will
be
the
ind
of
it
is
not
that
the
wife
of
arrowhead
skulking
in
the
corner
there
speak
not
of
her
reproachfully
pathfinder
i
owe
her
my
life
my
present
security
tell
me
what
has
happened
to
my
father
party
why
you
are
here
and
i
will
relate
all
the
horrible
events
that
have
passed
upon
this
few
words
will
do
the
last
mabel
for
one
used
to
indian
devilries
needs
but
little
explanations
on
such
a
subject
everything
turned
out
as
we
had
hoped
with
the
expedition
for
the
sarpent
was
on
the
and
he
met
us
with
all
the
information
heart
could
desire
we
ambushed
three
boats
druv
the
frenchers
out
of
them
got
possession
and
sunk
them
according
to
orders
in
the
deepest
part
of
the
channel
and
the
savages
of
upper
canada
will
fare
badly
for
indian
goods
this
winter
both
powder
and
ball
too
will
be
scarcer
among
them
than
keen
hunters
and
active
warriors
may
relish
we
did
not
lose
a
man
or
have
even
a
skin
barked
nor
do
i
think
the
inimy
suffered
to
speak
of
in
short
mabel
it
has
been
just
such
an
expedition
as
lundie
likes
much
harm
to
the
foe
and
little
harm
to
ah
pathfinder
i
fear
when
major
duncan
comes
to
hear
the
whole
of
the
sad
tale
he
will
find
reason
to
regret
he
ever
undertook
the
i
know
what
you
mean
i
know
what
you
mean
but
by
telling
my
story
straight
you
will
understand
it
better
as
soon
as
the
sergeant
found
himself
successful
he
sent
me
and
the
sarpent
off
in
canoes
to
tell
you
how
matters
had
turned
out
and
he
is
following
with
the
two
boats
which
being
so
much
heavier
can
not
arrive
before
morning
i
parted
from
chingachgook
this
forenoon
it
being
agreed
that
he
should
come
up
one
set
of
channels
and
i
another
to
see
that
the
path
was
clear
not
seen
the
chief
mabel
now
explained
the
manner
in
which
she
had
discovered
the
mohican
and
her
expectation
that
he
would
yet
come
to
the
blockhouse
not
he
not
he
a
regular
scout
will
never
get
behind
walls
or
logs
so
long
as
he
can
keep
the
open
air
and
find
useful
employment
i
should
not
have
come
myself
mabel
but
i
promised
the
sergeant
to
comfort
you
and
to
look
after
your
safety
ah
me
i
reconnoitred
the
island
with
a
heavy
heart
this
forenoon
and
there
was
a
bitter
hour
when
i
fancied
you
might
be
among
the
by
what
lucky
accident
were
you
prevented
from
paddling
up
boldly
to
the
island
and
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
by
such
an
accident
mabel
as
providence
employs
to
tell
the
hound
where
to
find
the
deer
and
the
deer
how
to
throw
off
the
hound
no
no
these
artifices
and
devilries
with
dead
bodies
may
deceive
the
soldiers
of
the
and
the
king
officers
but
they
are
all
lost
upon
men
who
have
passed
their
days
in
the
forest
i
came
down
the
channel
in
face
of
the
pretended
fisherman
and
though
the
riptyles
have
set
up
the
poor
wretch
with
art
it
was
not
ingenious
enough
to
take
in
a
practysed
eye
the
rod
was
held
too
high
for
the
have
learned
to
fish
at
oswego
if
they
never
knew
how
before
and
then
the
man
was
too
quiet
for
one
who
got
neither
prey
nor
bite
but
we
never
come
in
upon
a
post
blindly
and
i
have
lain
outside
a
garrison
a
whole
night
because
they
had
changed
their
sentries
and
their
mode
of
standing
guard
neither
the
sarpent
nor
myself
would
be
likely
to
be
taken
in
by
these
clumsy
contrivances
which
were
most
probably
intended
for
the
scotch
who
are
cunning
enough
in
some
particulars
though
anything
but
witches
when
indian
sarcumventions
are
in
the
do
you
think
my
father
and
his
men
may
yet
be
deceived
said
mabel
quickly
not
if
i
can
prevent
it
mabel
you
say
the
sarpent
is
on
the
too
so
there
is
a
double
chance
of
our
succeeding
in
letting
him
know
his
danger
though
it
is
by
no
means
sartain
by
which
channel
the
party
may
pathfinder
said
our
heroine
solemnly
for
the
frightful
scenes
she
had
witnessed
had
clothed
death
with
unusual
horrors
pathfinder
you
have
professed
love
for
me
a
wish
to
make
me
your
wife
i
did
ventur
to
speak
on
that
subject
mabel
and
the
sergeant
has
even
lately
said
that
you
are
kindly
disposed
but
i
am
not
a
man
to
persecute
the
thing
i
hear
me
pathfinder
i
respect
you
honor
you
revere
you
save
my
father
from
this
dreadful
death
and
i
can
worship
you
here
is
my
hand
as
a
solemn
pledge
for
my
faith
when
you
come
to
claim
bless
you
bless
you
mabel
this
is
more
than
i
desarve
more
i
fear
than
i
shall
know
how
to
profit
by
as
i
ought
it
was
not
wanting
however
to
make
me
sarve
the
sergeant
we
are
old
comrades
and
owe
each
other
a
life
though
i
fear
me
mabel
being
a
father
comrade
is
not
always
the
best
recommendation
with
a
you
want
no
other
recommendation
than
your
own
acts
your
courage
your
fidelity
all
that
you
do
and
say
pathfinder
my
reason
approves
and
the
heart
will
nay
it
this
is
a
happiness
i
little
expected
this
night
but
we
are
in
hands
and
he
will
protect
us
in
his
own
way
these
are
sweet
words
mabel
but
they
were
not
wanting
to
make
me
do
all
that
man
can
do
in
the
present
circumstances
they
will
not
lessen
my
endeavors
now
we
understand
each
other
pathfinder
mabel
added
hoarsely
let
us
not
lose
one
of
the
precious
moments
which
may
be
of
incalculable
value
can
we
not
get
into
your
canoe
and
go
and
meet
my
father
that
is
not
the
course
i
advise
i
do
know
by
which
channel
the
sergeant
will
come
and
there
are
twenty
rely
on
it
the
sarpent
will
be
winding
his
way
through
them
all
no
no
my
advice
is
to
remain
here
the
logs
of
this
blockhouse
are
still
green
and
it
will
not
be
easy
to
set
them
on
fire
and
i
can
make
good
the
place
bating
a
burning
a
tribe
the
iroquois
nation
can
not
dislodge
me
from
this
fortress
so
long
as
we
can
keep
the
flames
off
it
the
sergeant
is
now
on
some
island
and
will
not
come
in
until
morning
if
we
hold
the
block
we
can
give
him
timely
warning
by
firing
rifles
for
instance
and
should
he
determine
to
attack
the
savages
as
a
man
of
his
temper
will
be
very
likely
to
do
the
possession
of
this
building
will
be
of
great
account
in
the
affair
no
no
my
judgment
says
remain
if
the
object
be
to
sarve
the
sergeant
though
escape
for
our
two
selves
will
be
no
very
difficult
stay
murmured
mabel
stay
for
god
sake
pathfinder
anything
everything
to
save
my
father
yes
that
is
natur
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
this
mabel
for
i
own
a
wish
to
see
the
sergeant
fairly
supported
as
the
matter
now
stands
he
has
gained
himself
credit
and
could
he
once
drive
off
these
miscreants
and
make
an
honorable
retreat
laying
the
huts
and
block
in
ashes
no
doubt
lundie
would
remember
it
and
sarve
him
accordingly
yes
yes
mabel
we
must
not
only
save
the
sergeant
life
but
we
must
save
his
no
blame
can
rest
on
my
father
on
account
of
the
surprise
of
this
there
no
telling
there
no
telling
military
glory
is
a
most
unsartain
thing
i
seen
the
delawares
routed
when
they
desarved
more
credit
than
at
other
times
when
they
carried
the
day
a
man
is
wrong
to
set
his
head
on
success
of
any
sort
and
worst
of
all
on
success
in
war
i
know
little
of
the
settlements
or
of
the
notions
that
men
hold
in
them
but
up
hereaway
even
the
indians
rate
a
warrior
character
according
to
his
luck
the
principal
thing
with
a
soldier
is
never
to
be
whipt
nor
do
i
think
mankind
stops
long
to
consider
how
the
day
was
won
or
lost
for
my
part
mabel
i
make
it
a
rule
when
facing
the
inimy
to
give
him
as
good
as
i
can
send
and
to
try
to
be
moderate
after
a
defeat
little
need
be
said
on
that
score
as
a
flogging
is
one
of
the
most
humbling
things
in
natur
the
parsons
preach
about
humility
in
the
garrison
but
if
humility
would
make
christians
the
king
troops
ought
to
be
saints
for
they
done
little
as
yet
this
war
but
take
lessons
from
the
french
beginning
at
fort
du
quesne
and
ending
at
my
father
could
not
have
suspected
that
the
position
of
the
island
was
known
to
the
enemy
resumed
mabel
whose
thoughts
were
running
on
the
probable
effect
of
the
recent
events
on
the
sergeant
that
is
true
nor
do
i
well
see
how
the
frenchers
found
it
out
the
spot
is
well
chosen
and
it
is
not
an
easy
matter
even
for
one
who
has
travelled
the
road
to
and
from
it
to
find
it
again
there
has
been
treachery
i
fear
yes
yes
there
must
have
been
oh
pathfinder
can
this
be
nothing
is
easier
mabel
for
treachery
comes
as
to
some
men
as
eating
now
when
i
find
a
man
all
fair
words
i
look
close
to
his
deeds
for
when
the
heart
is
right
and
really
intends
to
do
good
it
is
generally
satisfied
to
let
the
conduct
speak
instead
of
the
jasper
western
is
not
one
of
these
said
mabel
impetuously
no
youth
can
be
more
sincere
in
his
manner
or
less
apt
to
make
the
tongue
act
for
the
jasper
western
tongue
and
heart
are
both
right
with
that
lad
depend
on
it
mabel
and
the
notion
taken
up
by
lundie
and
the
quartermaster
and
the
sergeant
and
your
uncle
too
is
as
wrong
as
it
would
be
to
think
that
the
sun
shone
by
night
and
the
stars
shone
by
day
no
no
i
answer
for
honesty
with
my
own
scalp
or
at
need
with
my
own
bless
you
bless
you
pathfinder
exclaimed
mabel
extending
her
own
hand
and
pressing
the
iron
fingers
of
her
companion
under
a
state
of
feeling
that
far
surpassed
her
own
consciousness
of
its
strength
you
are
all
that
is
generous
all
that
is
noble
god
will
reward
you
for
ah
mabel
i
fear
me
if
this
be
true
i
should
not
covet
such
a
wife
as
yourself
but
would
leave
you
to
be
sued
for
by
some
gentleman
of
the
garrison
as
your
desarts
we
will
not
talk
of
this
any
more
mabel
answered
in
a
voice
so
smothered
as
to
seem
nearly
choked
we
must
think
less
of
ourselves
just
now
pathfinder
and
more
of
our
friends
but
i
rejoice
from
my
soul
that
you
believe
jasper
innocent
now
let
us
talk
of
other
things
ought
we
not
to
release
june
i
been
thinking
about
the
woman
for
it
will
not
be
safe
to
shut
our
eyes
and
leave
hers
open
on
this
side
of
the
blockhouse
door
if
we
put
her
in
the
upper
room
and
take
away
the
ladder
she
be
a
prisoner
at
i
can
not
treat
one
thus
who
has
saved
my
life
it
would
be
better
to
let
her
depart
for
i
think
she
is
too
much
my
friend
to
do
anything
to
harm
you
do
not
know
the
race
mabel
you
do
not
know
the
race
it
true
she
not
a
mingo
but
she
consorts
with
the
vagabonds
and
must
have
larned
some
of
their
tricks
what
is
that
it
sounds
like
oars
some
boat
is
passing
through
the
pathfinder
closed
the
trap
that
led
to
the
lower
room
to
prevent
june
from
escaping
extinguished
the
candle
and
went
hastily
to
a
loop
mabel
looking
over
his
shoulder
in
breathless
curiosity
these
several
movements
consumed
a
minute
or
two
and
by
the
time
the
eye
of
the
scout
had
got
a
dim
view
of
things
without
two
boats
had
swept
past
and
shot
up
to
the
shore
at
a
spot
some
fifty
yards
beyond
the
block
where
there
was
a
regular
landing
the
obscurity
prevented
more
from
being
seen
and
pathfinder
whispered
to
mabel
that
the
were
as
likely
to
be
foes
as
friends
for
he
did
not
think
her
father
could
possibly
have
arrived
so
soon
a
number
of
men
were
now
seen
to
quit
the
boats
and
then
followed
three
hearty
english
cheers
leaving
no
further
doubts
of
the
character
of
the
party
pathfinder
sprang
to
the
trap
raised
it
glided
down
the
ladder
and
began
to
unbar
the
door
with
an
earnestness
that
proved
how
critical
he
deemed
the
moment
mabel
had
followed
but
she
rather
impeded
than
aided
his
exertions
and
but
a
single
bar
was
turned
when
a
heavy
discharge
of
rifles
was
heard
they
were
still
standing
in
breathless
suspense
as
the
rang
in
all
the
surrounding
thickets
the
door
now
opened
and
both
pathfinder
and
mabel
rushed
into
the
open
air
all
human
sounds
had
ceased
after
listening
half
a
minute
however
pathfinder
thought
he
heard
a
few
stifled
groans
near
the
boats
but
the
wind
blew
so
fresh
and
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
mingled
so
much
with
the
murmurs
of
the
passing
air
that
he
was
far
from
certain
but
mabel
was
borne
away
by
her
feelings
and
she
rushed
by
him
taking
the
way
towards
the
boats
this
will
not
do
mabel
said
the
scout
in
an
earnest
but
low
voice
seizing
her
by
an
arm
this
will
never
do
sartain
death
would
follow
and
that
without
sarving
any
one
we
must
return
to
the
father
my
poor
dear
murdered
father
said
the
girl
wildly
though
habitual
caution
even
at
that
trying
moment
induced
her
to
speak
low
pathfinder
if
you
love
me
let
me
go
to
my
dear
this
will
not
do
mabel
it
is
singular
that
no
one
speaks
no
one
returns
the
fire
from
the
boats
and
i
have
left
killdeer
in
the
block
but
of
what
use
would
a
rifle
be
when
no
one
is
to
be
seen
at
that
moment
the
quick
eye
of
pathfinder
which
while
he
held
mabel
firmly
in
his
grasp
had
never
ceased
to
roam
over
the
dim
scene
caught
an
indistinct
view
of
five
or
six
dark
crouching
forms
endeavoring
to
steal
past
him
doubtless
with
the
intention
of
intercepting
the
retreat
to
the
blockhouse
catching
up
mabel
and
putting
her
under
an
arm
as
if
she
were
an
infant
the
sinewy
frame
of
the
woodsman
was
exerted
to
the
utmost
and
he
succeeded
in
entering
the
building
the
tramp
of
his
pursuers
seemed
immediately
at
his
heels
dropping
his
burden
he
turned
closed
the
door
and
had
fastened
one
bar
as
a
rush
against
the
solid
mass
threatened
to
force
it
from
the
hinges
to
secure
the
other
bars
was
the
work
of
an
instant
mabel
now
ascended
to
the
first
floor
while
pathfinder
remained
as
a
sentinel
below
our
heroine
was
in
that
state
in
which
the
body
exerts
itself
apparently
without
the
control
of
the
mind
she
relighted
the
candle
mechanically
as
her
companion
had
desired
and
returned
with
it
below
where
he
was
waiting
her
reappearance
no
sooner
was
pathfinder
in
possession
of
the
light
than
he
examined
the
place
carefully
to
make
certain
no
one
was
concealed
in
the
fortress
ascending
to
each
floor
in
succession
after
assuring
himself
that
he
left
no
enemy
in
his
rear
the
result
was
the
conviction
that
the
blockhouse
now
contained
no
one
but
mabel
and
himself
june
having
escaped
when
perfectly
convinced
on
this
material
point
pathfinder
rejoined
our
heroine
in
the
principal
apartment
setting
down
the
light
and
examining
the
priming
of
killdeer
before
he
seated
himself
our
worst
fears
are
realized
said
mabel
to
whom
the
hurry
and
excitement
of
the
last
five
minutes
appeared
to
contain
the
emotions
of
a
life
my
beloved
father
and
all
his
party
are
slain
or
captured
we
do
know
that
morning
will
tell
us
all
i
do
not
think
the
affair
so
settled
as
that
or
we
should
hear
the
vagabond
mingos
yelling
out
their
triumph
around
the
blockhouse
of
one
thing
we
may
be
sartain
if
the
inimy
has
really
got
the
better
he
will
not
be
long
in
calling
upon
us
to
surrender
the
squaw
will
let
him
into
the
secret
of
our
situation
and
as
they
well
know
the
place
can
not
be
fired
by
daylight
so
long
as
killdeer
continues
to
desarve
his
reputation
you
may
depend
on
it
that
they
will
not
be
backward
in
making
their
attempt
while
darkness
helps
surely
i
hear
a
groan
is
fancy
mabel
when
the
mind
gets
to
be
skeary
especially
a
woman
mind
she
often
concaits
things
that
have
no
reality
i
known
them
that
imagined
there
was
truth
in
nay
i
am
deceived
there
is
surely
one
below
and
in
pathfinder
was
compelled
to
own
that
the
quick
senses
of
mabel
had
not
deceived
her
he
cautioned
her
however
to
repress
her
feelings
and
reminded
her
that
the
savages
were
in
the
practice
of
resorting
to
every
artifice
to
attain
their
ends
and
that
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
the
groans
were
feigned
with
a
view
to
lure
them
from
the
blockhouse
or
at
least
to
induce
them
to
open
the
door
no
no
no
said
mabel
hurriedly
there
is
no
artifice
in
those
sounds
and
they
come
from
anguish
of
body
if
not
of
spirit
they
are
fearfully
well
we
shall
soon
know
whether
a
friend
is
there
or
not
hide
the
light
again
mabel
and
i
will
speak
the
person
from
a
not
a
little
precaution
was
necessary
according
to
judgment
and
experience
in
performing
even
this
simple
act
for
he
had
known
the
careless
slain
by
their
want
of
proper
attention
to
what
might
have
seemed
to
the
ignorant
supererogatory
means
of
safety
he
did
not
place
his
mouth
to
the
loop
itself
but
so
near
it
that
he
could
be
heard
without
raising
his
voice
and
the
same
precaution
was
observed
as
regards
his
ear
who
is
below
pathfinder
demanded
when
his
arrangements
were
made
to
his
mind
is
any
one
in
suffering
if
a
friend
speak
boldly
and
depend
on
our
pathfinder
answered
a
voice
that
both
mabel
and
the
person
addressed
at
once
knew
to
be
the
sergeant
pathfinder
in
the
name
of
god
tell
me
what
has
become
of
my
father
i
am
here
unhurt
safe
and
oh
that
i
could
think
the
same
of
you
the
ejaculation
of
thanksgiving
that
followed
was
distinctly
audible
to
the
two
but
it
was
clearly
mingled
with
a
groan
of
pain
my
worst
forebodings
are
realized
said
mabel
with
a
sort
of
desperate
calmness
pathfinder
my
father
must
be
brought
within
the
block
though
we
hazard
everything
to
do
this
is
natur
and
it
is
the
law
of
god
but
mabel
be
calm
and
endivor
to
be
cool
all
that
can
be
effected
for
the
sergeant
by
human
invention
shall
be
done
i
only
ask
you
to
be
i
am
i
am
pathfinder
never
in
my
life
was
i
more
calm
more
collected
than
at
this
moment
but
remember
how
perilous
may
be
every
instant
for
heaven
sake
what
we
do
let
us
do
without
pathfinder
was
struck
with
the
firmness
of
mabel
tones
and
perhaps
he
was
a
little
deceived
by
the
forced
tranquillity
and
she
had
assumed
at
all
events
he
did
not
deem
any
further
explanations
necessary
but
descended
forthwith
and
began
to
unbar
the
door
this
delicate
process
was
conducted
with
the
usual
caution
but
as
he
warily
permitted
the
mass
of
timber
to
swing
back
on
the
hinges
he
felt
a
pressure
against
it
that
had
nearly
induced
him
to
close
it
again
but
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
cause
through
the
crack
the
door
was
permitted
to
swing
back
when
the
body
of
sergeant
dunham
which
was
propped
against
it
fell
partly
within
the
block
to
draw
in
the
legs
and
secure
the
fastenings
occupied
the
pathfinder
but
a
moment
then
there
existed
no
obstacle
to
their
giving
their
undivided
care
to
the
wounded
man
mabel
in
this
trying
scene
conducted
herself
with
the
sort
of
unnatural
energy
that
her
sex
when
aroused
is
apt
to
manifest
she
got
the
light
administered
water
to
the
parched
lips
of
her
father
and
assisted
pathfinder
in
forming
a
bed
of
straw
for
his
body
and
a
pillow
of
clothes
for
his
head
all
this
was
done
earnestly
and
almost
without
speaking
nor
did
mabel
shed
a
tear
until
she
heard
the
blessings
of
her
father
murmured
on
her
head
for
this
tenderness
and
care
all
this
time
mabel
had
merely
conjectured
the
condition
of
her
parent
pathfinder
however
had
shown
greater
attention
to
the
physical
danger
of
the
sergeant
he
had
ascertained
that
a
had
passed
through
the
body
of
the
wounded
man
and
he
was
sufficiently
familiar
with
injuries
of
this
nature
to
be
certain
that
the
chances
of
his
surviving
the
hurt
were
very
trifling
if
any
chapter
xxiv
then
drink
my
tears
while
yet
they
fall
would
that
my
bosom
blood
were
balm
and
well
thou
knowest
i
shed
it
all
to
give
thy
brow
one
minute
calm
moore
the
eyes
of
sergeant
dunham
had
not
ceased
to
follow
the
form
of
his
beautiful
daughter
from
the
moment
that
the
light
appeared
he
next
examined
the
door
of
the
block
to
ascertain
its
security
for
he
was
left
on
the
ground
below
there
being
no
available
means
of
raising
him
to
the
upper
floor
then
he
sought
the
face
of
mabel
for
as
life
wanes
fast
the
affections
resume
their
force
and
we
begin
to
value
that
most
which
we
feel
we
are
about
to
lose
for
ever
god
be
praised
my
child
you
at
least
have
escaped
their
murderous
rifles
he
said
for
he
spoke
with
strength
and
seemingly
with
no
additional
pain
give
me
the
history
of
this
sad
business
ah
me
sergeant
it
been
sad
as
you
say
that
there
has
been
treachery
and
the
position
of
the
island
has
been
betrayed
is
now
as
sartain
in
my
judgment
as
that
we
still
hold
the
block
but
major
duncan
was
right
interrupted
dunham
laying
a
hand
on
the
other
arm
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
sergeant
no
not
in
that
of
view
never
at
least
not
in
my
opinion
i
know
that
natur
is
weak
human
natur
i
mean
and
that
we
should
none
of
us
vaunt
of
our
gifts
whether
red
or
white
but
i
do
not
think
a
lad
lives
on
the
lines
than
jasper
bless
you
bless
you
for
that
pathfinder
burst
forth
from
very
soul
while
a
flood
of
tears
gave
vent
to
emotions
that
were
so
varied
while
they
were
so
violent
oh
bless
you
pathfinder
bless
you
the
brave
should
never
desert
the
brave
the
honest
should
sustain
the
the
father
eyes
were
fastened
anxiously
on
the
face
of
his
daughter
until
the
latter
hid
her
countenance
in
her
apron
to
conceal
her
tears
and
then
they
turned
with
inquiry
to
the
hard
features
of
the
guide
the
latter
merely
wore
their
usual
expression
of
frankness
sincerity
and
uprightness
and
the
sergeant
motioned
to
him
to
proceed
you
know
the
spot
where
the
sarpent
and
i
left
you
sergeant
pathfinder
resumed
and
i
need
say
nothing
of
all
that
happened
afore
it
is
now
too
late
to
regret
what
is
gone
and
passed
but
i
do
think
if
i
had
stayed
with
the
boats
this
would
not
have
come
to
pass
other
men
may
be
as
good
guides
i
make
no
doubt
they
are
but
then
natur
bestows
its
gifts
and
some
must
be
better
than
other
some
i
daresay
poor
gilbert
who
took
my
place
has
suffered
for
his
he
fell
at
my
elbow
the
sergeant
answered
in
a
low
melancholy
tone
we
have
indeed
all
suffered
for
our
no
no
sergeant
i
meant
no
condemnation
on
you
for
men
were
never
better
commanded
than
yourn
in
this
very
expedition
i
never
beheld
a
prettier
flanking
and
the
way
in
which
you
carried
your
own
boat
up
their
howitzer
might
have
teached
lundie
himself
a
the
eyes
of
the
sergeant
brightened
and
his
face
even
wore
an
expression
of
military
triumph
though
it
was
of
a
degree
that
suited
the
humble
sphere
in
which
he
had
been
an
actor
was
not
badly
done
my
friend
said
he
and
we
carried
their
log
breastwork
by
was
nobly
done
sergeant
though
i
fear
when
all
the
truth
comes
to
be
known
it
will
be
found
that
these
vagabonds
have
got
their
howitzer
back
well
well
put
a
stout
heart
upon
it
and
try
to
forget
all
that
is
disagreeable
and
to
remember
only
the
pleasant
part
of
the
matter
that
is
your
truest
philosophy
ay
and
truest
religion
too
if
the
inimy
has
got
the
howitzer
they
only
got
what
belonged
to
them
afore
and
what
we
could
help
they
have
got
the
blockhouse
yet
nor
are
they
likely
to
get
it
unless
they
fire
it
in
the
dark
well
sergeant
the
sarpent
and
i
separated
about
ten
miles
down
the
river
for
we
thought
it
wisest
not
to
come
upon
even
a
friendly
camp
without
the
usual
caution
what
has
become
of
chingachgook
i
can
not
say
though
mabel
tells
me
he
is
not
far
off
and
i
make
no
question
the
delaware
is
doing
his
duty
although
he
is
not
now
visible
to
our
eyes
mark
my
word
sergeant
before
this
matter
is
over
we
shall
hear
of
him
at
some
critical
time
and
that
in
a
discreet
and
creditable
manner
ah
the
sarpent
is
indeed
a
wise
and
virtuous
chief
and
any
white
man
might
covet
his
gifts
though
his
rifle
is
not
quite
as
sure
as
killdeer
it
must
be
owned
well
as
i
came
near
the
island
i
missed
the
smoke
and
that
put
me
on
my
guard
for
i
knew
that
the
men
of
the
were
not
cunning
enough
to
conceal
that
sign
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
told
them
of
its
danger
this
made
me
more
careful
until
i
came
in
sight
of
this
mockfisherman
as
i
just
told
mabel
and
then
the
whole
of
their
infernal
arts
was
as
plain
before
me
as
if
i
saw
it
on
a
map
i
need
not
tell
you
sergeant
that
my
first
thoughts
were
of
mabel
and
that
finding
she
was
in
the
block
i
came
here
in
order
to
live
or
die
in
her
the
father
turned
a
gratified
look
upon
his
child
and
mabel
felt
a
sinking
of
the
heart
that
at
such
a
moment
she
could
not
have
thought
possible
when
she
wished
to
believe
all
her
concern
centred
in
the
situation
of
her
parent
as
the
latter
held
out
his
hand
she
took
it
in
her
own
and
kissed
it
then
kneeling
at
his
side
she
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
mabel
said
he
steadily
the
will
of
god
must
be
done
it
is
useless
to
attempt
deceiving
either
you
or
myself
my
time
has
come
and
it
is
a
consolation
to
me
to
die
like
a
soldier
lundie
will
do
me
justice
for
our
good
friend
pathfinder
will
tell
him
what
has
been
done
and
how
all
came
to
pass
you
do
not
forget
our
last
conversation
nay
father
my
time
has
probably
come
too
exclaimed
mabel
who
felt
just
then
as
if
it
would
be
a
relief
to
die
i
can
not
hope
to
escape
and
pathfinder
would
do
well
to
leave
us
and
return
to
the
garrison
with
the
sad
news
while
he
mabel
dunham
said
pathfinder
reproachfully
though
he
took
her
hand
with
kindness
i
have
not
desarved
this
i
know
i
am
wild
and
uncouth
and
ungainly
pathfinder
well
well
we
forget
it
you
did
not
mean
it
you
could
not
think
it
it
is
useless
now
to
talk
of
escaping
for
the
sergeant
can
not
be
moved
and
the
blockhouse
must
be
defended
cost
what
it
will
maybe
lundie
will
get
the
tidings
of
our
disaster
and
send
a
party
to
raise
the
pathfinder
mabel
said
the
sergeant
who
had
been
writhing
with
pain
until
the
cold
sweat
stood
on
his
forehead
come
both
to
my
side
you
understand
each
other
i
hope
father
say
nothing
of
that
it
is
all
as
you
thank
god
give
me
your
hand
mabel
here
pathfinder
take
it
i
can
do
no
more
than
give
you
the
girl
in
this
way
i
know
you
will
make
her
a
kind
husband
do
not
wait
on
account
of
my
death
but
there
will
be
a
chaplain
in
the
fort
before
the
season
closes
and
let
him
marry
you
at
once
my
brother
if
living
will
wish
to
go
back
to
his
vessel
and
then
the
child
will
have
no
protector
mabel
your
husband
will
have
been
my
friend
and
that
will
be
some
consolation
to
you
i
trust
this
matter
to
me
sergeant
put
in
pathfinder
leave
it
all
in
my
hands
as
your
dying
request
and
depend
on
it
all
will
go
as
it
i
do
i
do
put
all
confidence
in
you
my
trusty
friend
and
empower
you
to
act
as
i
could
act
myself
in
every
particular
mabel
child
hand
me
the
water
you
will
never
repent
this
night
bless
you
my
daughter
god
bless
and
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
this
tenderness
was
inexpressibly
touching
to
one
of
mabel
feelings
and
she
felt
at
that
moment
as
if
her
future
union
with
pathfinder
had
received
a
solemnization
that
no
ceremony
of
the
church
could
render
more
holy
still
a
weight
as
that
of
a
mountain
lay
upon
her
heart
and
she
thought
it
would
be
happiness
to
die
then
followed
a
short
pause
when
the
sergeant
in
broken
sentences
briefly
related
what
had
passed
since
he
parted
with
pathfinder
and
the
delaware
the
wind
had
come
more
favorable
and
instead
of
encamping
on
an
island
agreeably
to
the
original
intention
he
had
determined
to
continue
and
reach
the
station
that
night
their
approach
would
have
been
unseen
and
a
portion
of
the
calamity
avoided
he
thought
had
they
not
grounded
on
the
point
of
a
neighboring
island
where
no
doubt
the
noise
made
by
the
men
in
getting
off
the
boat
gave
notice
of
their
approach
and
enabled
the
enemy
to
be
in
readiness
to
receive
them
they
had
landed
without
the
slightest
suspicion
of
danger
though
surprised
at
not
finding
a
sentinel
and
had
actually
left
their
arms
in
the
boat
with
the
intention
of
first
securing
their
knapsacks
and
provisions
the
fire
had
been
so
close
that
notwithstanding
the
obscurity
it
was
very
deadly
every
man
had
fallen
though
two
or
three
subsequently
arose
and
disappeared
four
or
five
of
the
soldiers
had
been
killed
or
so
nearly
so
as
to
survive
but
a
few
minutes
though
for
some
unknown
reason
the
enemy
did
not
make
the
usual
rush
for
the
scalps
sergeant
dunham
fell
with
the
others
and
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
mabel
as
she
rushed
from
the
blockhouse
this
frantic
appeal
aroused
all
his
parental
feelings
and
had
enabled
him
to
crawl
as
far
as
the
door
of
the
building
where
he
had
raised
himself
against
the
logs
in
the
manner
already
mentioned
after
this
simple
explanation
was
made
the
sergeant
was
so
weak
as
to
need
repose
and
his
companions
while
they
ministered
to
his
wants
suffered
some
time
to
pass
in
silence
pathfinder
took
the
occasion
to
reconnoitre
from
the
loops
and
the
roof
and
he
examined
the
condition
of
the
rifles
of
which
there
were
a
dozen
kept
in
the
building
the
soldiers
having
used
their
regimental
muskets
in
the
expedition
but
mabel
never
left
her
father
side
for
an
instant
and
when
by
his
breathing
she
fancied
he
slept
she
bent
her
knees
and
prayed
the
that
succeeded
was
awfully
solemn
and
still
the
moccasin
of
pathfinder
was
barely
heard
overhead
and
occasionally
the
sound
of
the
breech
of
a
rifle
fell
upon
the
floor
for
he
was
busied
in
examining
the
pieces
with
a
view
to
ascertain
the
state
of
their
charges
and
their
primings
beyond
this
nothing
was
so
loud
as
the
breathing
of
the
wounded
man
mabel
heart
yearned
to
be
in
communication
with
the
father
she
was
so
soon
to
lose
and
yet
she
would
not
disturb
his
apparent
repose
but
dunham
slept
not
he
was
in
that
state
when
the
world
suddenly
loses
its
attractions
its
illusions
and
its
power
and
the
unknown
future
fills
the
mind
with
its
conjectures
its
revelations
and
its
immensity
he
had
been
a
moral
man
for
one
of
his
mode
of
life
but
he
had
thought
little
of
this
moment
had
the
din
of
battle
been
ringing
in
his
ears
his
martial
ardor
might
have
endured
to
the
end
but
there
in
the
silence
of
that
nearly
untenanted
blockhouse
with
no
sound
to
enliven
him
no
appeal
to
keep
alive
factitious
sentiment
no
hope
of
victory
to
impel
things
began
to
appear
in
their
true
colors
and
this
state
of
being
to
be
estimated
at
its
just
value
he
would
have
given
treasures
for
religious
consolation
and
yet
he
knew
not
where
to
turn
to
seek
it
he
thought
of
pathfinder
but
he
distrusted
his
knowledge
he
thought
of
mabel
but
for
the
parent
to
appeal
to
the
child
for
such
succor
appeared
like
reversing
the
order
of
nature
then
it
was
that
he
felt
the
full
responsibility
of
the
parental
character
and
had
some
clear
glimpse
of
the
manner
in
which
he
himself
had
discharged
the
trust
towards
an
orphan
child
while
thoughts
like
these
were
rising
in
his
mind
mabel
who
watched
the
slightest
change
in
his
breathing
heard
a
guarded
knock
at
the
door
supposing
it
might
be
chingachgook
she
rose
undid
two
of
the
bars
and
held
the
third
in
her
hand
as
she
asked
who
was
there
the
answer
was
in
her
uncle
voice
and
he
implored
her
to
give
him
instant
admission
without
an
instant
of
hesitation
she
turned
the
bar
and
cap
entered
he
had
barely
passed
the
opening
when
mabel
closed
the
door
again
and
secured
it
as
before
for
practice
had
rendered
her
expert
in
this
portion
of
her
duties
the
sturdy
seaman
when
he
had
made
sure
of
the
state
of
his
and
that
mabel
as
well
as
himself
was
safe
was
softened
nearly
to
tears
his
own
appearance
he
explained
by
saying
that
he
had
been
carelessly
guarded
under
the
impression
that
he
and
the
quartermaster
were
sleeping
under
the
fumes
of
liquor
with
which
they
had
been
plied
with
a
view
to
keep
them
quiet
in
the
expected
engagement
muir
had
been
left
asleep
or
seeming
to
sleep
but
cap
had
run
into
the
bushes
on
the
alarm
of
the
attack
and
having
found
pathfinder
canoe
had
only
succeeded
at
that
moment
in
getting
to
the
blockhouse
whither
he
had
come
with
the
kind
intent
of
escaping
with
his
niece
by
water
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
he
changed
his
plan
when
he
ascertained
the
state
of
the
sergeant
and
the
apparent
security
of
his
present
quarters
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
master
pathfinder
said
he
we
must
strike
and
that
will
entitle
us
to
receive
quarter
we
owe
it
to
our
manhood
to
hold
out
a
reasonable
time
and
to
ourselves
to
haul
down
the
ensign
in
season
to
make
saving
conditions
i
wished
master
muir
to
do
the
same
thing
when
we
were
captured
by
these
chaps
you
call
vagabonds
and
rightly
are
they
named
for
viler
vagabonds
do
not
walk
the
earth
you
found
out
their
characters
interrupted
pathfinder
who
was
always
as
ready
to
chime
in
with
abuse
of
the
mingos
as
with
the
praises
of
his
friends
now
had
you
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
delawares
you
would
have
learned
the
well
to
me
they
seem
much
of
a
muchness
blackguards
fore
and
aft
always
excepting
our
friend
the
serpent
who
is
a
gentleman
for
an
indian
but
when
these
savages
made
the
assault
on
us
killing
corporal
and
his
men
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
rabbits
lieutenant
muir
and
myself
took
refuge
in
one
of
the
holes
of
this
here
island
of
which
there
are
so
many
among
the
rocks
and
there
we
remained
stowed
away
like
two
leaguers
in
a
ship
hold
until
we
gave
out
for
want
of
grub
a
man
may
say
that
grub
is
the
foundation
of
human
nature
i
desired
the
quartermaster
to
make
terms
for
we
could
have
defended
ourselves
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
place
bad
as
it
was
but
he
declined
on
the
ground
that
the
knaves
would
keep
faith
if
any
of
them
were
hurt
and
so
there
was
no
use
in
asking
them
to
i
consented
to
strike
on
two
principles
one
that
we
might
be
said
to
have
struck
already
for
running
below
is
generally
thought
to
be
giving
up
the
ship
and
the
other
that
we
had
an
enemy
in
our
stomachs
that
was
more
formidable
in
his
attacks
than
the
enemy
on
deck
hunger
is
a
d
ble
circumstance
as
any
man
who
has
lived
on
it
hours
will
uncle
said
mabel
in
a
mournful
voice
and
with
an
expostulatory
manner
my
poor
father
is
sadly
sadly
hurt
true
magnet
true
i
will
sit
by
him
and
do
my
best
at
consolation
are
the
bars
well
fastened
girl
for
on
such
an
occasion
the
mind
should
be
tranquil
and
we
are
safe
i
believe
from
all
but
this
heavy
blow
of
well
then
magnet
do
you
go
up
to
the
floor
above
and
try
to
compose
yourself
while
pathfinder
runs
aloft
and
takes
a
from
the
your
father
may
wish
to
say
something
to
me
in
private
and
it
may
be
well
to
leave
us
alone
these
are
solemn
scenes
and
inexperienced
people
like
myself
do
not
always
wish
what
they
say
to
be
although
the
idea
of
her
uncle
affording
religious
consolation
by
the
side
of
a
certainly
never
obtruded
itself
on
the
imagination
of
mabel
she
thought
there
might
be
a
propriety
in
the
request
with
which
she
was
unacquainted
and
she
complied
accordingly
pathfinder
had
already
ascended
to
the
roof
to
make
his
survey
and
the
were
left
alone
cap
took
a
seat
by
the
side
of
the
sergeant
and
bethought
him
seriously
of
the
grave
duty
he
had
before
him
a
silence
of
several
minutes
succeeded
during
which
brief
space
the
mariner
was
digesting
the
substance
of
his
intended
discourse
i
must
say
sergeant
dunham
cap
at
length
commenced
in
his
peculiar
manner
that
there
has
been
mismanagement
somewhere
in
this
unhappy
expedition
and
the
present
being
an
occasion
when
truth
ought
to
be
spoken
and
nothing
but
the
truth
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
be
say
as
much
in
plain
language
in
short
sergeant
on
this
point
there
can
not
well
be
two
opinions
for
seaman
as
i
am
and
no
soldier
i
can
see
several
errors
myself
that
it
needs
no
great
education
to
what
would
you
have
brother
cap
returned
the
other
in
a
feeble
voice
what
is
done
is
done
and
it
is
now
too
late
to
remedy
very
true
brother
dunham
but
not
to
repent
of
it
the
good
book
tells
us
it
is
never
too
late
to
repent
and
i
always
heard
that
this
is
the
precious
moment
if
you
anything
on
your
mind
sergeant
hoist
it
out
freely
for
you
know
you
trust
it
to
a
friend
you
were
my
own
sister
husband
and
poor
little
magnet
is
my
own
sister
daughter
and
living
or
dead
i
shall
always
look
upon
you
as
a
brother
it
a
thousand
pities
that
you
did
lie
off
and
on
with
the
boats
and
send
a
canoe
ahead
to
reconnoitre
in
which
case
your
command
would
have
been
saved
and
this
disaster
would
not
have
befallen
us
all
well
sergeant
we
are
mortal
that
is
some
consolation
i
make
no
doubt
and
if
you
go
before
a
little
why
we
must
follow
yes
that
give
you
i
know
all
this
brother
cap
and
hope
i
prepared
to
meet
a
fate
there
is
poor
mabel
ay
ay
that
a
heavy
drag
i
know
but
you
would
take
her
with
you
if
you
could
sergeant
and
so
the
better
way
is
to
make
as
light
of
the
separation
as
you
can
mabel
is
a
good
girl
and
so
was
her
mother
before
her
she
was
my
sister
and
it
shall
be
my
care
to
see
that
her
daughter
gets
a
good
husband
if
our
lives
and
scalps
are
spared
for
i
suppose
no
one
would
care
about
entering
into
a
family
that
has
no
brother
my
child
is
betrothed
she
will
become
the
wife
of
well
brother
dunham
every
man
has
his
opinions
and
his
manner
of
viewing
things
and
to
my
notion
this
match
will
be
anything
but
agreeable
to
mabel
i
have
no
objection
to
the
age
of
the
man
i
not
one
of
them
that
thinks
it
necessary
to
be
a
boy
to
make
a
girl
happy
but
on
the
whole
i
prefer
a
man
of
about
fifty
for
a
husband
still
there
ought
not
to
be
any
circumstance
between
the
parties
to
make
them
unhappy
circumstances
play
the
devil
with
matrimony
and
i
set
it
down
as
one
that
pathfinder
do
know
as
much
as
my
niece
you
seen
but
little
of
the
girl
sergeant
and
have
not
got
the
run
of
her
knowledge
but
let
her
pay
it
out
freely
as
she
will
do
when
she
gets
to
be
thoroughly
acquainted
and
you
fall
in
with
but
few
schoolmasters
that
can
keep
their
luffs
in
her
she
a
good
child
a
dear
good
child
muttered
the
sergeant
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
and
it
is
my
misfortune
that
i
have
seen
so
little
of
she
is
indeed
a
good
girl
and
knows
altogether
too
much
for
poor
pathfinder
who
is
a
reasonable
man
and
an
experienced
man
in
his
own
way
but
who
has
no
more
idea
of
the
main
chance
than
you
have
of
spherical
trigonometry
ah
brother
cap
had
pathfinder
been
with
us
in
the
boats
this
sad
affair
might
not
have
happened
that
is
quite
likely
for
his
worst
enemy
will
allow
that
the
man
is
a
good
guide
but
then
sergeant
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
you
have
managed
this
expedition
in
a
loose
way
altogether
you
should
have
off
your
haven
and
sent
in
a
boat
to
reconnoitre
as
i
told
you
before
that
is
a
matter
to
be
repented
of
and
i
tell
it
to
you
because
truth
in
such
a
case
ought
to
be
my
errors
are
dearly
paid
for
brother
and
poor
mabel
i
fear
will
be
the
sufferer
i
think
however
that
the
calamity
would
not
have
happened
had
there
not
been
treason
i
fear
me
brother
that
jasper
has
played
us
that
is
just
my
notion
for
this
life
must
sooner
or
later
undermine
any
man
morals
lieutenant
muir
and
myself
talked
this
matter
over
while
we
lay
in
a
bit
of
a
hole
out
here
on
this
island
and
we
both
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
short
of
treachery
could
have
brought
us
all
into
this
infernal
scrape
well
sergeant
you
had
better
compose
your
mind
and
think
of
other
matters
for
when
a
vessel
is
about
to
enter
a
strange
port
it
is
more
prudent
to
think
of
the
anchorage
inside
than
to
be
all
the
events
that
have
turned
up
during
the
there
the
expressly
to
note
all
these
matters
in
and
what
stands
there
must
form
the
column
of
figures
that
to
be
posted
up
for
or
against
us
how
now
pathfinder
is
there
anything
in
the
wind
that
you
come
down
the
ladder
like
an
indian
in
the
wake
of
a
scalp
the
guide
raised
a
finger
for
silence
and
then
beckoned
to
cap
to
ascend
the
first
ladder
and
to
allow
mabel
to
take
his
place
at
the
side
of
the
sergeant
we
must
be
prudent
and
we
must
be
bold
too
said
he
in
a
low
voice
the
riptyles
are
in
earnest
in
their
intention
to
fire
the
block
for
they
know
there
is
now
nothing
to
be
gained
by
letting
it
stand
i
hear
the
voice
of
that
vagabond
arrowhead
among
them
and
he
is
urging
them
to
set
about
their
devilry
this
very
night
we
must
be
stirring
saltwater
and
doing
too
luckily
there
are
four
or
five
barrels
of
water
in
the
block
and
these
are
something
towards
a
siege
my
reckoning
is
wrong
too
or
we
shall
yet
reap
some
advantage
from
that
honest
fellow
the
sarpent
being
at
cap
did
not
wait
for
a
second
invitation
but
stealing
away
he
was
soon
in
the
upper
room
with
pathfinder
while
mabel
took
his
post
at
the
side
of
her
father
humble
bed
pathfinder
had
opened
a
loop
having
so
far
concealed
the
light
that
it
would
not
expose
him
to
a
treacherous
shot
and
expecting
a
summons
he
stood
with
his
face
near
the
hole
ready
to
answer
the
stillness
that
succeeded
was
at
length
broken
by
the
voice
of
muir
master
pathfinder
called
out
the
scotchman
a
friend
summons
you
to
a
parley
come
freely
to
one
of
the
loops
for
you
nothing
to
fear
so
long
as
you
are
in
converse
with
an
officer
of
the
what
is
your
will
quartermaster
what
is
your
will
i
know
the
and
believe
it
to
be
a
brave
regiment
though
i
rather
incline
to
the
as
my
favorite
and
to
the
delawares
more
than
to
either
but
what
would
you
have
quartermaster
it
must
be
a
pressing
errand
that
brings
you
under
the
loops
of
a
blockhouse
at
this
hour
of
the
night
with
the
sartainty
of
killdeer
being
inside
of
oh
you
no
harm
a
friend
pathfinder
i
certain
and
that
my
security
you
a
man
of
judgment
and
have
gained
too
great
a
name
on
this
frontier
for
bravery
to
feel
the
necessity
of
foolhardiness
to
obtain
a
character
you
very
well
understand
my
good
friend
there
is
as
much
credit
to
be
gained
by
submitting
gracefully
when
resistance
becomes
impossible
as
by
obstinately
holding
out
contrary
to
the
rules
of
war
the
enemy
is
too
strong
for
us
my
brave
comrade
and
i
come
to
counsel
you
to
give
up
the
block
on
condition
of
being
treated
as
a
prisoner
of
i
thank
you
for
this
advice
quartermaster
which
is
the
more
acceptable
as
it
costs
nothing
but
i
do
not
think
it
belongs
to
my
gifts
to
yield
a
place
like
this
while
food
and
water
well
i
be
the
last
pathfinder
to
recommend
anything
against
so
brave
a
resolution
did
i
see
the
means
of
maintaining
it
but
remember
that
master
cap
has
not
he
not
he
roared
the
individual
in
question
through
another
loop
and
so
far
from
that
lieutenant
he
has
risen
to
the
height
of
this
here
fortification
and
has
no
mind
to
put
his
head
of
hair
into
the
hands
of
such
barbers
again
so
long
as
he
can
help
it
i
look
upon
this
blockhouse
as
a
circumstance
and
have
no
mind
to
throw
it
if
that
is
a
living
voice
returned
muir
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
for
we
all
thought
the
man
had
fallen
in
the
late
fearful
confusion
but
master
pathfinder
although
ye
enjoying
the
society
of
our
friend
cap
and
a
great
pleasure
do
i
know
it
to
be
by
the
experience
of
two
days
and
a
night
passed
in
a
hole
in
the
earth
we
lost
that
of
sergeant
dunham
who
has
fallen
with
all
the
brave
men
he
led
in
the
late
expedition
lundie
would
have
it
so
though
it
would
have
been
more
discreet
and
becoming
to
send
a
commissioned
officer
in
command
dunham
was
a
brave
man
notwithstanding
and
shall
have
justice
done
his
memory
in
short
we
have
all
acted
for
the
best
and
that
is
as
much
as
could
be
said
in
favor
of
prince
eugene
the
duke
of
marlborough
or
the
great
earl
of
stair
you
wrong
quartermaster
you
wrong
answered
pathfinder
resorting
to
a
ruse
to
magnify
his
force
the
sergeant
is
safe
in
the
block
too
where
one
might
say
the
whole
family
is
well
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
for
we
had
certainly
counted
the
sergeant
among
the
slain
if
pretty
mabel
is
in
the
block
still
let
her
not
delay
an
instant
for
heaven
sake
in
quitting
it
for
the
enemy
is
about
to
put
it
to
the
trial
by
fire
ye
know
the
potency
of
that
dread
element
and
will
be
acting
more
like
the
discreet
and
experienced
warrior
ye
universally
allowed
to
be
in
yielding
a
place
you
defend
than
in
drawing
down
ruin
on
yourself
and
i
know
the
potency
of
fire
as
you
call
it
quartermaster
and
am
not
to
be
told
at
this
late
hour
that
it
can
be
used
for
something
else
besides
cooking
a
dinner
but
i
make
no
doubt
you
heard
of
the
potency
of
killdeer
and
the
man
who
attempts
to
lay
a
pile
of
brush
against
these
logs
will
get
a
taste
of
his
power
as
for
arrows
it
is
not
in
their
gift
to
set
this
building
on
fire
for
we
no
shingles
on
our
roof
but
good
solid
logs
and
green
bark
and
plenty
of
water
besides
the
roof
is
so
flat
too
as
you
know
yourself
quartermaster
that
we
can
walk
on
it
and
so
no
danger
on
that
score
while
water
lasts
i
peaceable
enough
if
let
alone
but
he
who
endivors
to
burn
this
block
over
my
head
will
find
the
fire
squinched
in
his
own
this
is
idle
and
romantic
talk
pathfinder
and
ye
no
maintain
it
yourself
when
ye
come
to
meditate
on
the
realities
i
hope
ye
gainsay
the
loyalty
or
the
courage
of
the
and
i
feel
convinced
that
a
council
of
war
would
decide
on
the
propriety
of
a
surrender
forthwith
na
na
pathfinder
foolhardiness
is
na
mair
like
the
bravery
o
wallace
or
bruce
than
albany
on
the
hudson
is
like
the
old
town
of
as
each
of
us
seems
to
have
made
up
his
mind
quartermaster
more
words
are
useless
if
the
riptyles
near
you
are
disposed
to
set
about
their
hellish
job
let
them
begin
at
once
they
can
burn
wood
and
i
burn
powder
if
i
were
an
indian
at
the
stake
i
suppose
i
could
brag
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
but
my
gifts
and
natur
being
both
white
my
turn
is
rather
for
doing
than
talking
you
said
quite
enough
considering
you
carry
the
king
commission
and
should
we
all
be
consumed
none
of
us
will
bear
you
any
pathfinder
ye
no
be
exposing
mabel
pretty
mabel
dunham
to
sic
a
calamity
mabel
dunham
is
by
the
side
of
her
wounded
father
and
god
will
care
for
the
safety
of
a
pious
child
not
a
hair
of
her
head
shall
fall
while
my
arm
and
sight
remain
true
and
though
may
trust
the
mingos
master
muir
i
put
no
faith
in
them
you
a
knavish
tuscarora
in
your
company
there
who
has
art
and
malice
enough
to
spoil
the
character
of
any
tribe
with
which
he
consorts
though
he
found
the
mingos
ready
ruined
to
his
hands
i
fear
but
enough
said
now
let
each
party
go
to
the
use
of
his
means
and
his
throughout
this
dialogue
pathfinder
had
kept
his
body
covered
lest
a
treacherous
shot
should
be
aimed
at
the
loop
and
he
now
directed
cap
to
ascend
to
the
roof
in
order
to
be
in
readiness
to
meet
the
first
assault
although
the
latter
used
sufficient
diligence
he
found
no
less
than
ten
blazing
arrows
sticking
to
the
bark
while
the
air
was
filled
with
the
yells
and
whoops
of
the
enemy
a
rapid
discharge
of
rifles
followed
and
the
bullets
came
pattering
against
the
logs
in
a
way
to
show
that
the
struggle
had
indeed
seriously
commenced
these
were
sounds
however
that
appalled
neither
pathfinder
nor
cap
while
mabel
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
affliction
to
feel
alarm
she
had
good
sense
enough
too
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
defences
and
fully
to
appreciate
their
importance
as
for
her
father
the
familiar
noises
revived
him
and
it
pained
his
child
at
such
a
moment
to
see
that
his
glassy
eye
began
to
kindle
and
that
the
blood
returned
to
a
cheek
it
had
deserted
as
he
listened
to
the
uproar
it
was
now
mabel
first
perceived
that
his
reason
began
slightly
to
wander
order
up
the
light
companies
he
muttered
and
let
the
grenadiers
charge
do
they
dare
to
attack
us
in
our
fort
why
does
not
the
artillery
open
on
them
at
that
instant
the
heavy
report
of
a
gun
burst
on
the
night
and
the
crashing
of
rending
wood
was
heard
as
a
heavy
shot
tore
the
logs
in
the
room
above
and
the
whole
block
shook
with
the
force
of
a
shell
that
lodged
in
the
work
the
pathfinder
narrowly
escaped
the
passage
of
this
formidable
missile
as
it
entered
but
when
it
exploded
mabel
could
not
suppress
a
shriek
for
she
supposed
all
over
her
head
whether
animate
or
inanimate
destroyed
to
increase
her
horror
her
father
shouted
in
a
frantic
voice
to
charge
mabel
said
pathfinder
with
his
head
at
the
trap
this
is
true
mingo
work
more
noise
than
injury
the
vagabonds
have
got
the
howitzer
we
took
from
the
french
and
have
discharged
it
the
block
but
fortunately
they
have
fired
off
the
only
shell
we
had
and
there
is
an
ind
of
its
use
for
the
present
there
is
some
confusion
among
the
stores
up
in
this
loft
but
no
one
is
hurt
your
uncle
is
still
on
the
roof
and
as
for
myself
i
run
the
gauntlet
of
too
many
rifles
to
be
skeary
about
such
a
thing
as
a
howitzer
and
that
in
indian
mabel
murmured
her
thanks
and
tried
to
give
all
her
attention
to
her
father
whose
efforts
to
rise
were
only
counteracted
by
his
debility
during
the
fearful
minutes
that
succeeded
she
was
so
much
occupied
with
the
care
of
the
invalid
that
she
scarcely
heeded
the
clamor
that
reigned
around
her
indeed
the
uproar
was
so
great
that
had
not
her
thoughts
been
otherwise
employed
confusion
of
faculties
rather
than
alarm
would
probably
have
been
the
consequence
cap
preserved
his
coolness
admirably
he
had
a
profound
and
increasing
respect
for
the
power
of
the
savages
and
even
for
the
majesty
of
fresh
water
it
is
true
but
his
apprehensions
of
the
former
proceeded
more
from
his
dread
of
being
scalped
and
tortured
than
from
any
unmanly
fear
of
death
and
as
he
was
now
on
the
deck
of
a
house
if
not
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
and
knew
that
there
was
little
danger
of
boarders
he
moved
about
with
a
fearlessness
and
a
rash
exposure
of
his
person
that
pathfinder
had
he
been
aware
of
the
fact
would
have
been
the
first
to
condemn
instead
of
keeping
his
body
covered
agreeably
to
the
usages
of
indian
warfare
he
was
seen
on
every
part
of
the
roof
dashing
the
water
right
and
left
with
the
apparent
steadiness
and
unconcern
he
would
have
manifested
had
he
been
a
sail
trimmer
exercising
his
art
in
a
battle
afloat
his
appearance
was
one
of
the
causes
of
the
extraordinary
clamor
among
the
assailants
who
unused
to
see
their
enemies
so
reckless
opened
upon
him
with
their
tongues
like
a
pack
that
has
the
fox
in
view
still
he
appeared
to
possess
a
charmed
life
for
though
the
bullets
whistled
around
him
on
every
side
and
his
clothes
were
several
times
torn
nothing
cut
his
skin
when
the
shell
passed
through
the
logs
below
the
old
sailor
dropped
his
bucket
waved
his
hat
and
gave
three
cheers
in
which
heroic
act
he
was
employed
as
the
dangerous
missile
exploded
this
characteristic
feat
probably
saved
his
life
for
from
that
instant
the
indians
ceased
to
fire
at
him
and
even
to
shoot
their
flaming
arrows
at
the
block
having
taken
up
the
notion
simultaneously
and
by
common
consent
that
the
saltwater
was
mad
and
it
was
a
singular
effect
of
their
magnanimity
never
to
lift
a
hand
against
those
whom
they
imagined
devoid
of
reason
the
conduct
of
pathfinder
was
very
different
everything
he
did
was
regulated
by
the
most
exact
calculation
the
result
of
long
experience
and
habitual
thoughtfulness
his
person
was
kept
carefully
out
of
a
line
with
the
loops
and
the
spot
that
he
selected
for
his
was
one
quite
removed
from
danger
this
celebrated
guide
had
often
been
known
to
lead
forlorn
hopes
he
had
once
stood
at
the
stake
suffering
under
the
cruelties
and
taunts
of
savage
ingenuity
and
savage
ferocity
without
quailing
and
legends
of
his
exploits
coolness
and
daring
were
to
be
heard
all
along
that
extensive
frontier
or
wherever
men
dwelt
and
men
contended
but
on
this
occasion
one
who
did
not
know
his
history
and
character
might
have
thought
his
exceeding
care
and
studied
attention
to
proceeded
from
an
unworthy
motive
but
such
a
judge
would
not
have
understood
his
subject
the
pathfinder
bethought
him
of
mabel
and
of
what
might
possibly
be
the
consequences
to
that
poor
girl
should
any
casualty
befall
himself
but
the
recollection
rather
quickened
his
intellect
than
changed
his
customary
prudence
he
was
in
fact
one
of
those
who
was
so
unaccustomed
to
fear
that
he
never
bethought
him
of
the
constructions
others
might
put
upon
his
conduct
but
while
in
moments
of
danger
he
acted
with
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
it
was
also
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
for
the
first
ten
minutes
of
the
assault
pathfinder
never
raised
the
breech
of
his
rifle
from
the
floor
except
when
he
changed
his
own
position
for
he
well
knew
that
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
were
thrown
away
upon
the
massive
logs
of
the
work
and
as
he
had
been
at
the
capture
of
the
howitzer
he
felt
certain
that
the
savages
had
no
other
shell
than
the
one
found
in
it
when
the
piece
was
taken
there
existed
no
reason
therefore
to
dread
the
fire
of
the
assailants
except
as
a
casual
bullet
might
find
a
passage
through
a
loophole
one
or
two
of
these
accidents
did
occur
but
the
balls
entered
at
an
angle
that
deprived
them
of
all
chance
of
doing
any
injury
so
long
as
the
indians
kept
near
the
block
and
if
discharged
from
a
distance
there
was
scarcely
the
possibility
of
one
in
a
hundred
striking
the
apertures
but
when
pathfinder
heard
the
sound
of
mocassined
feet
and
the
rustling
of
brush
at
the
foot
of
the
building
he
knew
that
the
attempt
to
build
a
fire
against
the
logs
was
about
to
be
renewed
he
now
summoned
cap
from
the
roof
where
indeed
all
the
danger
had
ceased
and
directed
him
to
stand
in
readiness
with
his
water
at
a
hole
immediately
over
the
spot
assailed
one
less
trained
than
our
hero
would
have
been
in
a
hurry
to
repel
this
dangerous
attempt
also
and
might
have
resorted
to
his
means
prematurely
not
so
with
pathfinder
his
aim
was
not
only
to
extinguish
the
fire
about
which
he
felt
little
apprehension
but
to
give
the
enemy
a
lesson
that
would
render
him
wary
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
order
to
effect
the
latter
purpose
it
became
necessary
to
wait
until
the
light
of
the
intended
conflagration
should
direct
his
aim
when
he
well
knew
that
a
very
slight
effort
of
his
skill
would
suffice
the
iroquois
were
permitted
to
collect
their
heap
of
dried
brush
to
pile
it
against
the
block
to
light
it
and
to
return
to
their
covers
without
molestation
all
that
pathfinder
would
suffer
cap
to
do
was
to
roll
a
barrel
filled
with
water
to
the
hole
immediately
over
the
spot
in
readiness
to
be
used
at
the
proper
instant
that
moment
however
did
not
arrive
in
his
judgment
until
the
blaze
illuminated
the
surrounding
bushes
and
there
had
been
time
for
his
quick
and
practised
eye
to
detect
the
forms
of
three
or
four
lurking
savages
who
were
watching
the
progress
of
the
flames
with
the
cool
indifference
of
men
accustomed
to
look
on
human
misery
with
apathy
then
indeed
he
spoke
are
you
ready
friend
cap
he
asked
the
heat
begins
to
strike
through
the
crevices
and
although
these
green
logs
are
not
of
the
fiery
natur
of
an
man
they
may
be
kindled
into
a
blaze
if
one
provokes
them
too
much
are
you
ready
with
the
barrel
see
that
it
has
the
right
cut
and
that
none
of
the
water
is
all
ready
answered
cap
in
the
manner
in
which
a
seaman
replies
to
such
a
demand
then
wait
for
the
word
never
be
in
a
critical
time
nor
in
a
battle
wait
for
the
while
the
pathfinder
was
giving
these
directions
he
was
also
making
his
own
preparations
for
he
saw
it
was
time
to
act
killdeer
was
deliberately
raised
pointed
and
discharged
the
whole
process
occupied
about
half
a
minute
and
as
the
rifle
was
drawn
in
the
eye
of
the
marksman
was
applied
to
the
hole
there
is
one
riptyle
the
less
pathfinder
muttered
to
himself
seen
that
vagabond
afore
and
know
him
to
be
a
marciless
devil
well
well
the
man
acted
according
to
his
gifts
and
he
has
been
rewarded
according
to
his
gifts
one
more
of
the
knaves
and
that
will
sarve
the
turn
for
when
daylight
appears
we
may
have
hotter
all
this
time
another
rifle
was
being
got
ready
and
as
pathfinder
ceased
a
second
savage
fell
this
indeed
sufficed
for
indisposed
to
wait
for
a
third
visitation
from
the
same
hand
the
whole
band
which
had
been
crouching
in
the
bushes
around
the
block
ignorant
of
who
was
and
who
was
not
exposed
to
view
leaped
from
their
covers
and
fled
to
different
places
for
safety

away
master
cap
said
pathfinder
i
made
my
mark
on
the
blackguards
and
we
shall
have
no
more
fires
lighted
scaldings
cried
cap
upsetting
the
barrel
with
a
care
that
at
once
and
completely
extinguished
the
flames
this
ended
the
singular
conflict
and
the
remainder
of
the
night
passed
in
peace
pathfinder
and
cap
watched
alternately
though
neither
can
be
said
to
have
slept
sleep
indeed
scarcely
seemed
necessary
to
them
for
both
were
accustomed
to
protracted
watchings
and
there
were
seasons
and
times
when
the
former
appeared
to
be
literally
insensible
to
the
demands
of
hunger
and
thirst
and
callous
to
the
effects
of
fatigue
mabel
watched
by
her
father
pallet
and
began
to
feel
how
much
our
happiness
in
this
world
depends
even
on
things
that
are
imaginary
hitherto
she
had
virtually
lived
without
a
father
the
connection
with
her
remaining
parent
being
ideal
rather
than
positive
but
now
that
she
was
about
to
lose
him
she
thought
for
the
moment
that
the
world
would
be
a
void
after
his
death
and
that
she
could
never
be
acquainted
with
happiness
again
chapter

there
was
a
roaring
in
the
wind
all
night
the
rain
came
heavily
and
fell
in
floods
but
now
the
sun
is
rising
calm
and
bright
the
birds
are
singing
in
the
distant
woods
wordsworth
as
the
light
returned
pathfinder
and
cap
ascended
again
to
the
roof
with
a
view
to
reconnoitre
the
state
of
things
once
more
on
the
island
this
part
of
the
blockhouse
had
a
low
battlement
around
it
which
afforded
a
considerable
protection
to
those
who
stood
in
its
centre
the
intention
having
been
to
enable
marksmen
to
lie
behind
it
and
to
fire
over
its
top
by
making
proper
use
therefore
of
these
slight
defences
slight
as
to
height
though
abundantly
ample
as
far
as
they
went
the
two
commanded
a
pretty
good
view
of
the
island
its
covers
excepted
and
of
most
of
the
channels
that
led
to
the
spot
the
gale
was
still
blowing
very
fresh
at
south
and
there
were
places
in
the
river
where
its
surface
looked
green
and
angry
though
the
wind
had
hardly
sweep
enough
to
raise
the
water
into
foam
the
shape
of
the
little
island
was
nearly
oval
and
its
greater
length
was
from
east
to
west
by
keeping
in
the
channels
that
washed
it
in
consequence
of
their
several
courses
and
of
the
direction
of
the
gale
it
would
have
been
possible
for
a
vessel
to
range
past
the
island
on
either
of
its
principal
sides
and
always
to
keep
the
wind
very
nearly
abeam
these
were
the
facts
first
noticed
by
cap
and
explained
to
his
companion
for
the
hopes
of
both
now
rested
on
the
chances
of
relief
sent
from
oswego
at
this
instant
while
they
stood
gazing
anxiously
about
them
cap
cried
out
in
his
lusty
hearty
manner
sail
ho
pathfinder
turned
quickly
in
the
direction
of
his
companion
face
and
there
sure
enough
was
just
visible
the
object
of
the
old
exclamation
the
elevation
enabled
the
two
to
overlook
the
low
land
of
several
of
the
adjacent
islands
and
the
canvas
of
a
vessel
was
seen
through
the
bushes
that
fringed
the
shore
of
one
that
lay
to
the
southward
and
westward
the
stranger
was
under
what
seamen
call
low
sail
but
so
great
was
the
power
of
the
wind
that
her
white
outlines
were
seen
flying
past
the
openings
of
the
verdure
with
the
velocity
of
a
horse
resembling
a
cloud
driving
in
the
heavens
that
can
not
be
jasper
said
pathfinder
in
disappointment
for
he
did
not
recognize
the
cutter
of
his
friend
in
the
object
no
no
the
lad
is
behind
the
hour
and
that
is
some
craft
which
the
frenchers
have
sent
to
aid
their
friends
the
accursed
this
time
you
are
out
in
your
reckoning
friend
pathfinder
if
you
never
were
before
returned
cap
in
a
manner
that
had
lost
none
of
its
dogmatism
by
the
critical
circumstances
in
which
they
were
placed
fresh
water
or
salt
that
is
the
head
of
the
mainsail
for
it
is
cut
with
a
smaller
gore
than
common
and
then
you
can
see
that
the
gaff
has
been
fished
quite
neatly
done
i
admit
but
i
can
see
none
of
this
i
confess
answered
pathfinder
to
whom
even
the
terms
of
his
companion
were
greek
no
well
i
own
that
surprises
me
for
i
thought
your
eyes
could
see
anything
now
to
me
nothing
is
plainer
than
that
gore
and
that
fish
and
i
must
say
my
honest
friend
that
in
your
place
i
should
apprehend
that
my
sight
was
beginning
to
if
jasper
is
truly
coming
i
shall
apprehend
but
little
we
can
make
good
the
block
against
the
whole
mingo
nation
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
hours
and
with
to
cover
the
retreat
i
shall
despair
of
nothing
god
send
that
the
lad
may
not
run
alongside
of
the
bank
and
fall
into
an
ambushment
as
befell
the
sergeant
ay
there
the
danger
there
ought
to
have
been
signals
concerted
and
an
buoyed
out
and
even
a
quarantine
station
or
a
lazaretto
would
have
been
useful
could
we
have
made
these
respect
the
laws
if
the
lad
fetches
up
as
you
say
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
island
we
may
look
upon
the
cutter
as
lost
and
after
all
master
pathfinder
ought
we
not
to
set
down
this
same
jasper
as
a
secret
ally
of
the
french
rather
than
as
a
friend
of
our
own
i
know
the
sergeant
views
the
matter
in
that
light
and
i
must
say
this
whole
affair
looks
like
we
shall
soon
know
we
shall
soon
know
master
cap
for
there
indeed
comes
the
cutter
clear
of
the
other
island
and
five
minutes
must
settle
the
matter
it
would
be
no
more
than
fair
however
if
we
could
give
the
boy
some
sign
in
the
way
of
warning
it
is
not
right
that
he
should
fall
into
the
trap
without
a
notice
that
it
has
been
anxiety
and
suspense
notwithstanding
prevented
either
from
attempting
to
make
any
signal
it
was
not
easy
truly
to
see
how
it
could
be
done
for
the
came
foaming
through
the
channel
on
the
weather
side
of
the
island
at
a
rate
that
scarcely
admitted
of
the
necessary
time
nor
was
any
one
visible
on
her
deck
to
make
signs
to
even
her
helm
seemed
deserted
though
her
course
was
as
steady
as
her
progress
was
rapid
cap
stood
in
silent
admiration
of
a
spectacle
so
unusual
but
as
the
drew
nearer
his
practised
eye
detected
the
helm
in
play
by
means
of
though
the
person
who
steered
was
concealed
as
the
cutter
had
weatherboards
of
some
little
height
the
mystery
was
explained
no
doubt
remaining
that
her
people
lay
behind
the
latter
in
order
to
be
protected
from
the
rifles
of
the
enemy
as
this
fact
showed
that
no
force
beyond
that
of
the
small
crew
could
be
on
board
pathfinder
received
his
companion
explanation
with
an
ominous
shake
of
the
head
this
proves
that
the
sarpent
has
not
reached
oswego
said
he
and
that
we
are
not
to
expect
succor
from
the
garrison
i
hope
lundie
has
not
taken
it
into
his
head
to
displace
the
lad
for
jasper
western
would
be
a
host
of
himself
in
such
a
strait
we
three
master
cap
ought
to
make
a
manful
warfare
you
as
a
seaman
to
keep
up
the
intercourse
with
the
cutter
jasper
as
a
laker
who
knows
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
done
on
the
water
and
i
with
gifts
that
are
as
good
as
any
among
the
mingos
let
me
be
what
i
may
in
other
particulars
i
say
we
ought
to
make
a
manful
fight
in
mabel
that
we
ought
and
that
we
will
answered
cap
heartily
for
he
began
to
have
more
confidence
in
the
security
of
his
scalp
now
that
he
saw
the
sun
again
i
set
down
the
arrival
of
the
as
one
circumstance
and
the
chances
of
honesty
as
another
this
jasper
is
a
young
man
of
prudence
you
find
for
he
keeps
a
good
offing
and
seems
determined
to
know
how
matters
stand
on
the
island
before
he
ventures
to
bring
i
have
it
i
have
it
exclaimed
pathfinder
with
exultation
there
lies
the
canoe
of
the
sarpent
on
the
cutter
deck
and
the
chief
has
got
on
board
and
no
doubt
has
given
a
true
account
of
our
condition
for
unlike
a
mingo
a
delaware
is
sartain
to
get
a
story
right
or
to
hold
his
that
canoe
may
not
belong
to
the
cutter
said
the
captious
seaman
had
one
on
board
when
he
very
true
friend
cap
but
if
you
know
your
sails
and
masts
by
your
gores
and
fishes
i
know
my
canoes
and
my
paths
by
frontier
knowledge
if
you
can
see
new
cloth
in
a
sail
i
can
see
new
bark
in
a
canoe
that
is
the
boat
of
the
sarpent
and
the
noble
fellow
has
struck
off
for
the
garrison
as
soon
as
he
found
the
block
besieged
has
fallen
in
with
the
and
after
telling
his
story
has
brought
the
cutter
down
here
to
see
what
can
be
done
the
lord
grant
that
jasper
western
be
still
on
board
her
yes
yes
it
might
not
be
amiss
for
traitor
or
loyal
the
lad
has
a
handy
way
with
him
in
a
gale
it
must
be
and
in
coming
over
waterfalls
said
pathfinder
nudging
the
ribs
of
his
companion
with
an
elbow
and
laughing
in
his
silent
but
hearty
manner
we
will
give
the
boy
his
due
though
he
scalps
us
all
with
his
own
the
was
now
so
near
that
cap
made
no
reply
the
scene
just
at
that
instant
was
so
peculiar
that
it
merits
a
particular
description
which
may
also
aid
the
reader
in
forming
a
more
accurate
nature
of
the
picture
we
wish
to
draw
the
gale
was
still
blowing
violently
many
of
the
smaller
trees
bowed
their
tops
as
if
ready
to
descend
to
the
earth
while
the
rushing
of
the
wind
through
the
branches
of
the
groves
resembled
the
roar
of
distant
chariots
the
air
was
filled
with
leaves
which
at
that
late
season
were
readily
driven
from
their
stems
and
flew
from
island
to
island
like
flights
of
birds
with
this
exception
the
spot
seemed
silent
as
the
grave
that
the
savages
still
remained
was
to
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
their
canoes
together
with
the
boats
of
the
lay
in
a
group
in
the
little
cove
that
had
been
selected
as
a
harbor
otherwise
not
a
sign
of
their
presence
was
to
be
detected
though
taken
entirely
by
surprise
by
the
cutter
the
sudden
return
of
which
was
altogether
so
uniform
and
inbred
were
their
habits
of
caution
while
on
the
that
the
instant
an
alarm
was
given
every
man
had
taken
to
his
cover
with
the
instinct
and
cunning
of
a
fox
seeking
his
hole
the
same
stillness
reigned
in
the
blockhouse
for
though
pathfinder
and
cap
could
command
a
view
of
the
channel
they
took
the
precaution
necessary
to
lie
concealed
the
unusual
absence
of
anything
like
animal
life
on
board
the
too
was
still
more
remarkable
as
the
indians
witnessed
her
apparently
undirected
movements
a
feeling
of
awe
gained
a
footing
among
them
and
some
of
the
boldest
of
their
party
began
to
distrust
the
issue
of
an
expedition
that
had
commenced
so
prosperously
even
arrowhead
accustomed
as
he
was
to
intercourse
with
the
whites
on
both
sides
of
the
lakes
fancied
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
appearance
of
this
unmanned
vessel
and
he
would
gladly
at
that
moment
have
been
landed
again
on
the
main
in
the
meantime
the
progress
of
the
cutter
was
steady
and
rapid
she
held
her
way
now
inclining
to
the
gusts
and
now
rising
again
like
the
philosopher
that
bends
to
the
calamities
of
life
to
resume
his
erect
attitude
as
they
pass
away
but
always
piling
the
water
beneath
her
bows
in
foam
although
she
was
under
so
very
short
canvas
her
velocity
was
great
and
there
could
not
have
elapsed
ten
minutes
between
the
time
when
her
sails
were
first
seen
glancing
past
the
trees
and
bushes
in
the
distance
and
the
moment
when
she
was
abreast
of
the
blockhouse
cap
and
pathfinder
leaned
forward
as
the
cutter
came
beneath
their
eyrie
eager
to
get
a
better
view
of
her
deck
when
to
the
delight
of
both
jasper
sprang
upon
his
feet
and
gave
three
hearty
cheers
regardless
of
all
risk
cap
leaped
upon
the
rampart
of
logs
and
returned
the
greeting
cheer
for
cheer
happily
the
policy
of
the
enemy
saved
the
latter
for
they
still
lay
quiet
not
a
rifle
being
discharged
on
the
other
hand
pathfinder
kept
in
view
the
useful
utterly
disregarding
the
mere
dramatic
part
of
warfare
the
moment
he
beheld
his
friend
jasper
he
called
out
to
him
with
stentorian
lungs
stand
by
us
lad
and
the
day
our
own
give
a
grist
in
yonder
bushes
and
you
put
up
like
part
of
this
reached
jasper
ears
but
most
was
borne
off
to
leeward
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
by
the
time
this
was
said
the
had
driven
past
and
in
the
next
moment
she
was
hid
from
view
by
the
grove
in
which
the
blockhouse
was
partially
concealed
two
anxious
minutes
succeeded
but
at
the
expiration
of
that
brief
space
the
sails
were
again
gleaming
through
the
trees
jasper
having
wore
jibed
and
hauled
up
under
the
lee
of
the
island
on
the
other
tack
the
wind
was
free
enough
as
has
been
already
explained
to
admit
of
this
manoeuvre
and
the
cutter
catching
the
current
under
her
lee
bow
was
breasted
up
to
her
course
in
a
way
that
showed
she
would
come
out
to
windward
of
the
island
again
without
any
difficulty
this
whole
evolution
was
made
with
the
greatest
facility
not
a
sheet
being
touched
the
sails
trimming
themselves
the
rudder
alone
controlling
the
admirable
machine
the
object
appeared
to
be
a
reconnoissance
when
however
the
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
entire
island
and
had
again
got
her
weatherly
position
in
the
channel
by
which
she
had
first
approached
her
helm
was
put
down
and
she
tacked
the
noise
of
the
mainsail
flapping
when
it
filled
as
it
was
sounded
like
the
report
of
a
gun
and
cap
trembled
lest
the
seams
should
open
his
majesty
gives
good
canvas
it
must
be
owned
muttered
the
old
seaman
and
it
must
be
owned
too
that
boy
handles
his
boat
as
if
he
were
thoroughly
bred
d
master
pathfinder
if
i
believe
after
all
that
has
been
reported
in
the
matter
that
this
mister
got
his
trade
on
this
bit
of
fresh
he
did
yes
he
did
he
never
saw
the
ocean
and
has
come
by
his
calling
altogether
up
here
on
ontario
i
have
often
thought
he
has
a
gift
in
the
way
of
schooners
and
sloops
and
have
respected
him
accordingly
as
for
treason
and
lying
and
vices
friend
cap
jasper
western
is
as
free
as
the
most
virtuousest
of
the
delaware
warriors
and
if
you
crave
to
see
a
truly
honest
man
you
must
go
among
that
tribe
to
discover
there
he
comes
round
exclaimed
the
delighted
cap
the
at
this
moment
filling
on
her
original
tack
and
now
we
shall
see
what
the
boy
would
be
at
he
can
not
mean
to
keep
running
up
and
down
these
passages
like
a
girl
footing
it
through
a
the
now
kept
so
much
away
that
for
a
moment
the
two
observers
on
the
blockhouse
feared
jasper
meant
to
and
the
savages
in
their
lairs
gleamed
out
upon
her
with
the
sort
of
exultation
that
the
crouching
tiger
may
be
supposed
to
feel
as
he
sees
his
unconscious
victim
approach
his
bed
but
jasper
had
no
such
intention
familiar
with
the
shore
and
acquainted
with
the
depth
of
water
on
every
part
of
the
island
he
well
knew
that
the
might
be
run
against
the
bank
with
impunity
and
he
ventured
fearlessly
so
near
that
as
he
passed
through
the
little
cove
he
swept
the
two
boats
of
the
soldiers
from
their
fastenings
and
forced
them
out
into
the
channel
towing
them
with
the
cutter
as
all
the
canoes
were
fastened
to
the
two
dunham
boats
by
this
bold
and
successful
attempt
the
savages
were
at
once
deprived
of
the
means
of
quitting
the
island
unless
by
swimming
and
they
appeared
to
be
instantly
aware
of
the
very
important
fact
rising
in
a
body
they
filled
the
air
with
yells
and
poured
in
a
harmless
fire
while
up
in
this
unguarded
manner
two
rifles
were
discharged
by
their
adversaries
one
came
from
the
summit
of
the
block
and
an
iroquois
fell
dead
in
his
tracks
shot
through
the
brain
the
other
came
from
the
the
last
was
the
piece
of
the
delaware
but
less
true
than
that
of
his
friend
it
only
maimed
an
enemy
for
life
the
people
of
the
shouted
and
the
savages
sank
again
to
a
man
as
if
it
might
be
into
the
earth
that
was
the
sarpent
voice
said
pathfinder
as
soon
as
the
second
piece
was
discharged
i
know
the
crack
of
his
rifle
as
well
as
i
do
that
of
killdeer
is
a
good
barrel
though
not
sartain
death
well
well
with
chingachgook
and
jasper
on
the
water
and
you
and
i
in
the
block
friend
cap
it
will
be
hard
if
we
do
teach
these
mingo
scamps
the
rationality
of
a
all
this
time
the
was
in
motion
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
island
jasper
sent
his
prizes
adrift
and
they
went
down
before
the
wind
until
they
stranded
on
a
point
half
a
mile
to
leeward
he
then
wore
and
came
stemming
the
current
again
through
the
other
passage
those
on
the
summit
of
the
block
could
now
perceive
that
something
was
in
agitation
on
the
deck
of
the
and
to
their
great
delight
just
as
the
cutter
came
abreast
of
the
principal
cove
on
the
spot
where
most
of
the
enemy
lay
the
howitzer
which
composed
her
sole
armament
was
unmasked
and
a
shower
of
was
sent
hissing
into
the
bushes
a
bevy
of
quail
would
not
have
risen
quicker
than
this
unexpected
discharge
of
iron
hail
put
up
the
iroquois
when
a
second
savage
fell
by
a
messenger
sent
from
killdeer
and
another
went
limping
away
by
a
visit
from
the
rifle
of
chingachgook
new
covers
were
immediately
found
however
and
each
party
seemed
to
prepare
for
the
renewal
of
the
strife
in
another
form
but
the
appearance
of
june
bearing
a
white
flag
and
accompanied
by
the
french
officer
and
muir
stayed
the
hands
of
all
and
was
the
forerunner
of
another
parley
the
negotiation
that
followed
was
held
beneath
the
blockhouse
and
so
near
it
as
at
once
to
put
those
who
were
uncovered
completely
at
the
mercy
of
pathfinder
unerring
aim
jasper
anchored
directly
abeam
and
the
howitzer
too
was
kept
trained
upon
the
negotiators
so
that
the
besieged
and
their
friends
with
the
exception
of
the
man
who
held
the
match
had
no
hesitation
about
exposing
their
persons
chingachgook
alone
lay
in
ambush
more
however
from
habit
than
distrust
you
triumphed
pathfinder
called
out
the
quartermaster
and
captain
sanglier
has
come
himself
to
offer
terms
you
no
be
denying
a
brave
enemy
honorable
retreat
when
he
has
fought
ye
fairly
and
done
all
the
credit
he
could
to
king
and
country
ye
are
too
loyal
a
subject
yourself
to
visit
loyalty
and
fidelity
with
a
heavy
judgment
i
am
authorized
to
offer
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
an
evacuation
of
the
island
a
mutual
exchange
of
prisoners
and
a
restoration
of
scalps
in
the
absence
of
baggage
and
artillery
little
more
can
be
as
the
conversation
was
necessarily
carried
on
in
a
high
key
both
on
account
of
the
wind
and
of
the
distance
all
that
was
said
was
heard
equally
by
those
in
the
block
and
those
in
the
cutter
what
do
you
say
to
that
jasper
called
out
pathfinder
you
hear
the
proposal
shall
we
let
the
vagabonds
go
or
shall
we
mark
them
as
they
mark
their
sheep
in
the
settlements
that
we
may
know
them
again
what
has
befallen
mabel
dunham
demanded
the
young
man
with
a
frown
on
his
handsome
face
that
was
visible
even
to
those
on
the
block
if
a
hair
of
her
head
has
been
touched
it
will
go
hard
with
the
whole
iroquois
nay
nay
she
is
safe
below
nursing
a
dying
parent
as
becomes
her
sex
we
owe
no
grudge
on
account
of
the
sergeant
hurt
which
comes
of
lawful
warfare
and
as
for
mabel
she
is
here
exclaimed
the
girl
herself
who
had
mounted
to
the
roof
the
moment
she
found
the
direction
things
were
taking
she
is
here
and
in
the
name
of
our
holy
religion
and
of
that
god
whom
we
profess
to
worship
in
common
let
there
be
no
more
bloodshed
enough
has
been
spilt
already
and
if
these
men
will
go
away
pathfinder
if
they
will
depart
peaceably
jasper
oh
do
not
detain
one
of
them
my
poor
father
is
approaching
his
end
and
it
were
better
that
he
should
draw
his
last
breath
in
peace
with
the
world
go
go
frenchmen
and
indians
we
are
no
longer
your
enemies
and
will
harm
none
of
tut
tut
magnet
put
in
cap
this
sounds
religious
perhaps
or
like
a
book
of
poetry
but
it
does
not
sound
like
common
sense
the
enemy
is
just
ready
to
strike
jasper
is
anchored
with
his
broadside
to
bear
and
no
doubt
with
springs
on
his
cables
pathfinder
eye
and
hand
are
as
true
as
the
needle
and
we
shall
get
and
honor
in
the
bargain
if
you
will
not
interfere
for
the
next
well
said
pathfinder
i
incline
to
mabel
way
of
thinking
there
been
enough
blood
shed
to
answer
our
purpose
and
to
sarve
the
king
and
as
for
honor
in
that
meaning
it
will
do
better
for
young
ensigns
and
recruits
than
for
obsarvant
christian
men
there
is
honor
in
doing
what
right
and
unhonor
in
doing
what
wrong
and
i
think
it
wrong
to
take
the
life
even
of
a
mingo
without
a
useful
end
in
view
i
do
and
right
to
hear
reason
at
all
times
so
lieutenant
muir
let
us
know
what
your
friends
the
frenchers
and
indians
have
to
say
for
my
friends
said
muir
starting
you
no
be
calling
the
enemies
my
friends
pathfinder
because
the
fortune
of
war
has
thrown
me
into
their
hands
some
of
the
greatest
warriors
both
of
ancient
and
modern
times
have
been
prisoners
of
war
and
yon
is
master
cap
who
can
testify
whether
we
did
not
do
all
that
men
could
devise
to
escape
the
ay
ay
drily
answered
cap
escape
is
the
proper
word
we
ran
below
and
hid
ourselves
and
so
discreetly
that
we
might
have
remained
in
the
hole
to
this
hour
had
it
not
been
for
the
necessity
of
the
bread
lockers
you
burrowed
on
that
occasion
quartermaster
as
handily
as
a
fox
and
how
the
d
you
knew
so
well
where
to
find
the
spot
is
a
matter
of
wonder
to
me
a
regular
skulk
on
board
ship
does
not
trail
aft
more
readily
when
the
jib
is
to
be
stowed
than
you
went
into
that
same
and
did
ye
no
follow
there
are
moments
in
a
man
life
when
reason
ascends
to
instinct
and
men
descend
into
holes
interrupted
cap
laughing
in
his
boisterous
way
while
pathfinder
chimed
in
in
his
peculiar
manner
even
jasper
though
still
filled
with
concern
for
mabel
was
obliged
to
smile
they
say
the
d
would
make
a
sailor
if
he
did
look
aloft
and
now
it
seems
he
not
make
a
soldier
if
he
does
look
below
this
burst
of
merriment
though
it
was
anything
but
agreeable
to
muir
contributed
largely
towards
keeping
the
peace
cap
fancied
he
had
said
a
thing
much
better
than
common
and
that
disposed
him
to
yield
his
own
opinion
on
the
main
point
so
long
as
he
got
the
good
opinion
of
his
companions
on
his
novel
claim
to
be
a
wit
after
a
short
discussion
all
the
savages
on
the
island
were
collected
in
a
body
without
arms
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
from
the
block
and
under
the
gun
of
the
while
pathfinder
descended
to
the
door
of
the
blockhouse
and
settled
the
terms
on
which
the
island
was
to
be
finally
evacuated
by
the
enemy
considering
all
the
circumstances
the
conditions
were
not
very
discreditable
to
either
party
the
indians
were
compelled
to
give
up
all
their
arms
even
to
their
knives
and
tomahawks
as
a
measure
of
precaution
their
force
being
still
quadruple
that
of
their
foes
the
french
officer
monsieur
sanglier
as
he
was
usually
styled
and
chose
to
call
himself
remonstrated
against
this
act
as
one
likely
to
reflect
more
discredit
on
his
command
than
any
other
part
of
the
affair
but
pathfinder
who
had
witnessed
one
or
two
indian
massacres
and
knew
how
valueless
pledges
became
when
put
in
opposition
to
interest
where
a
savage
was
concerned
was
obdurate
the
second
stipulation
was
of
nearly
the
same
importance
it
compelled
captain
sanglier
to
give
up
all
his
prisoners
who
had
been
kept
well
guarded
in
the
very
hole
or
cave
in
which
cap
and
muir
had
taken
refuge
when
these
men
were
produced
four
of
them
were
found
to
be
unhurt
they
had
fallen
merely
to
save
their
lives
a
common
artifice
in
that
species
of
warfare
and
of
the
remainder
two
were
so
slightly
injured
as
not
to
be
unfit
for
service
as
they
brought
their
muskets
with
them
this
addition
to
his
force
immediately
put
pathfinder
at
his
ease
for
having
collected
all
the
arms
of
the
enemy
in
the
blockhouse
he
directed
these
men
to
take
possession
of
the
building
stationing
a
regular
sentinel
at
the
door
the
remainder
of
the
soldiers
were
dead
the
badly
wounded
having
been
instantly
despatched
in
order
to
obtain
the
scalps
as
soon
as
jasper
was
made
acquainted
with
the
terms
and
the
preliminaries
had
been
so
far
observed
as
to
render
it
safe
for
him
to
be
absent
he
got
the
under
weigh
and
running
down
to
the
point
where
the
boats
had
stranded
he
took
them
in
tow
again
and
making
a
few
stretches
brought
them
into
the
leeward
passage
here
all
the
savages
instantly
embarked
when
jasper
took
the
boats
in
tow
a
third
time
and
running
off
before
the
wind
he
soon
set
them
adrift
full
a
mile
to
leeward
of
the
island
the
indians
were
furnished
with
but
a
single
oar
in
each
boat
to
steer
with
the
young
sailor
well
knowing
that
by
keeping
before
the
wind
they
would
land
on
the
shores
of
canada
in
the
course
of
the
morning
captain
sanglier
arrowhead
and
june
alone
remained
when
this
disposition
had
been
made
of
the
rest
of
the
party
the
former
having
certain
papers
to
draw
up
and
sign
with
lieutenant
muir
who
in
his
eyes
possessed
the
virtues
which
are
attached
to
a
commission
and
the
latter
preferring
for
reasons
of
his
own
not
to
depart
in
company
with
his
late
friends
the
iroquois
canoes
were
detained
for
the
departure
of
these
three
when
the
proper
moment
should
arrive
in
the
meantime
or
while
the
was
running
down
with
the
boats
in
tow
pathfinder
and
cap
aided
by
proper
assistants
busied
themselves
with
preparing
a
breakfast
most
of
the
party
not
having
eaten
for
hours
the
brief
space
that
passed
in
this
manner
before
the
again
was
little
interrupted
by
discourse
though
pathfinder
found
leisure
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
sergeant
to
say
a
few
friendly
words
to
mabel
and
to
give
such
directions
as
he
thought
might
smooth
the
passage
of
the
dying
man
as
for
mabel
herself
he
insisted
on
her
taking
some
light
refreshment
and
there
no
longer
existing
any
motive
for
keeping
it
there
he
had
the
guard
removed
from
the
block
in
order
that
the
daughter
might
have
no
impediment
to
her
attentions
to
her
father
these
little
arrangements
completed
our
hero
returned
to
the
fire
around
which
he
found
all
the
remainder
of
the
party
assembled
including
jasper
chapter
xxvi
you
saw
but
sorrow
in
its
waning
form
a
working
sea
remaining
from
a
storm
where
now
the
weary
waves
roll
the
deep
and
faintly
murmur
ere
they
fall
asleep
dryden
men
accustomed
to
a
warfare
like
that
we
have
been
describing
are
not
apt
to
be
much
under
the
influence
of
the
tender
feelings
while
still
in
the
field
notwithstanding
their
habits
however
more
than
one
heart
was
with
mabel
in
the
block
while
the
incidents
we
are
about
to
relate
were
in
the
course
of
occurrence
and
even
the
indispensable
meal
was
less
relished
by
the
hardiest
of
the
soldiers
than
it
might
have
been
had
not
the
sergeant
been
so
near
his
end
as
pathfinder
returned
from
the
block
he
was
met
by
muir
who
led
him
aside
in
order
to
hold
a
private
discourse
the
manner
of
the
quartermaster
had
that
air
of
supererogatory
courtesy
about
it
which
almost
invariably
denotes
artifice
for
while
physiognomy
and
phrenology
are
but
lame
sciences
at
the
best
and
perhaps
lead
to
as
many
false
as
right
conclusions
we
hold
that
there
is
no
more
infallible
evidence
of
insincerity
of
purpose
short
of
overt
acts
than
a
face
that
smiles
when
there
is
no
occasion
and
the
tongue
that
is
out
of
measure
smooth
muir
had
much
of
this
manner
in
common
mingled
with
an
apparent
frankness
that
his
scottish
intonation
of
voice
scottish
accent
and
scottish
modes
of
expression
were
singularly
adapted
to
sustain
he
owed
his
preferment
indeed
to
a
deference
to
lundie
and
his
family
for
while
the
major
himself
was
much
too
acute
to
be
the
dupe
of
one
so
much
his
inferior
in
real
talents
and
attainments
most
persons
are
accustomed
to
make
liberal
concessions
to
the
flatterer
even
while
they
distrust
his
truth
and
are
perfectly
aware
of
his
motives
on
the
present
occasion
the
contest
in
skill
was
between
two
men
as
completely
the
opposites
of
each
other
in
all
the
leading
essentials
of
character
as
very
well
could
be
pathfinder
was
as
simple
as
the
quartermaster
was
practised
he
was
as
sincere
as
the
other
was
false
and
as
direct
as
the
last
was
tortuous
both
were
cool
and
calculating
and
both
were
brave
though
in
different
modes
and
degrees
muir
never
exposing
his
person
except
for
effect
while
the
guide
included
fear
among
the
rational
passions
or
as
a
sensation
to
be
deferred
to
only
when
good
might
come
of
it
my
dearest
friend
muir
commenced
for
ye
be
dearer
to
us
all
by
seventy
and
sevenfold
after
your
late
conduct
than
ever
ye
were
just
established
yourself
in
this
late
transaction
it
true
that
they
not
be
making
ye
a
commissioned
officer
for
that
species
of
prefairment
is
not
much
in
your
line
nor
much
in
your
wishes
thinking
but
as
a
guide
and
a
counsellor
and
a
loyal
subject
and
an
expert
marksman
yer
renown
may
be
said
to
be
full
i
doubt
if
the
will
carry
away
with
him
from
america
as
much
credit
as
will
fall
to
yer
share
and
ye
ought
just
to
set
down
in
content
and
enjoy
yoursal
for
the
remainder
of
yer
days
get
married
man
without
delay
and
look
to
your
precious
happiness
for
ye
no
occasion
to
look
any
longer
to
your
glory
take
mabel
dunham
for
heaven
sake
to
your
bosom
and
ye
have
both
a
bonnie
bride
and
a
bonnie
why
quartermaster
this
is
a
new
piece
of
advice
to
come
from
your
mouth
they
told
me
i
had
a
rival
in
and
ye
had
man
and
a
formidible
one
too
i
can
tell
you
one
that
has
never
yet
courted
in
vain
and
yet
one
that
has
courted
five
times
lundie
twits
me
with
four
and
i
deny
the
charge
but
he
little
thinks
the
truth
would
outdo
even
his
arithmetic
yes
yes
ye
had
a
rival
pathfinder
but
ye
one
no
longer
in
me
ye
my
hearty
wishes
for
yer
success
with
mabel
and
were
the
honest
sergeant
likely
to
survive
ye
might
rely
on
my
good
word
with
him
too
for
a
i
feel
your
friendship
quartermaster
i
feel
your
friendship
though
i
have
no
great
need
of
any
favor
with
sergeant
dunham
who
has
long
been
my
friend
i
believe
we
may
look
upon
the
matter
to
be
as
sartain
as
most
things
in
for
mabel
and
her
father
consenting
the
whole
could
very
well
put
a
stop
to
it
ah
me
the
poor
father
will
scarcely
live
to
see
what
his
heart
has
so
long
been
set
but
he
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
it
will
come
to
pass
in
dying
oh
it
a
great
relief
pathfinder
for
the
parting
spirit
to
feel
certain
that
the
beloved
ones
left
behind
will
be
well
provided
for
after
its
departure
all
the
mistress
muirs
have
duly
expressed
that
sentiment
with
their
dying
all
your
wives
quartermaster
have
been
likely
to
feel
this
out
upon
ye
man
i
no
thought
ye
such
a
wag
well
well
pleasant
words
make
no
between
auld
if
i
can
not
espouse
mabel
ye
no
object
to
my
esteeming
her
and
speaking
well
of
her
and
of
yoursal
too
on
all
suitable
occasions
and
in
all
companies
but
pathfinder
ye
easily
understan
that
a
poor
deevil
who
loses
such
a
bride
will
probably
stand
in
need
of
some
consolation
quite
likely
quite
likely
quartermaster
returned
the
guide
i
know
the
loss
of
mabel
would
be
found
heavy
to
be
borne
by
myself
it
may
bear
hard
on
your
feelings
to
see
us
married
but
the
death
of
the
sergeant
will
be
likely
to
put
it
off
and
you
have
time
to
think
more
manfully
of
it
you
i
bear
up
against
it
yes
i
bear
up
against
it
though
my
crack
and
ye
might
help
me
man
by
giving
me
something
to
do
ye
understand
that
this
expedition
has
been
of
a
very
peculiar
nature
for
here
am
i
bearing
the
king
commission
just
a
volunteer
as
it
might
be
while
a
mere
orderly
has
had
the
command
i
submitted
for
various
reasons
though
my
blood
has
boiled
to
be
in
authority
while
ye
war
battling
for
the
honor
of
the
country
and
his
rights
quartermaster
interrupted
the
guide
you
fell
so
early
into
the
enemy
hands
that
your
conscience
ought
to
be
easily
satisfied
on
that
score
so
take
my
advice
and
say
nothing
about
that
just
my
opinion
pathfinder
we
all
say
nothing
about
it
sergeant
dunham
is
de
anan
said
the
guide
why
the
sergeant
can
command
no
longer
and
it
will
hardly
do
to
leave
a
corporal
at
the
head
of
a
victorious
party
like
this
for
flowers
that
will
bloom
in
a
garden
will
die
on
a
heath
and
i
was
just
thinking
i
would
claim
the
authority
that
belongs
to
one
who
holds
a
commission
as
for
the
men
they
no
dare
to
raise
any
objaction
and
as
for
yoursal
my
dear
friend
now
that
ye
so
much
honor
and
mabel
and
the
consciousness
of
having
done
yer
duty
which
is
more
precious
than
all
i
expect
to
find
an
ally
rather
than
one
to
oppose
the
as
for
commanding
the
soldiers
of
the
lieutenant
it
is
your
right
i
suppose
and
no
one
here
will
be
likely
to
gainsay
it
though
you
been
a
prisoner
of
war
and
there
are
men
who
might
stand
out
giving
up
their
authority
to
a
prisoner
released
by
their
own
deeds
still
no
one
here
will
be
likely
to
say
anything
hostile
to
your
that
just
it
pathfinder
and
when
i
come
to
draw
up
the
report
of
our
success
against
the
boats
and
the
defence
of
the
block
together
with
the
general
operations
including
the
capitulation
ye
no
find
any
omission
of
your
claims
and
tut
for
my
claims
and
merits
quartermaster
lundie
knows
what
i
am
in
the
forest
and
what
i
am
in
the
fort
and
the
general
knows
better
than
he
no
fear
of
me
tell
your
own
story
only
taking
care
to
do
justice
by
mabel
father
who
in
one
sense
is
the
commanding
officer
at
this
very
muir
expressed
his
entire
satisfaction
with
this
arrangement
as
well
as
his
determination
to
do
justice
by
all
when
the
two
went
to
the
group
assembled
round
the
fire
here
the
quartermaster
began
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
oswego
to
assume
some
of
the
authority
that
might
properly
be
supposed
to
belong
to
his
rank
taking
the
remaining
corporal
aside
he
distinctly
told
that
functionary
that
he
must
in
future
be
regarded
as
one
holding
the
king
commission
and
directed
him
to
acquaint
his
subordinates
with
the
new
state
of
things
this
change
in
the
dynasty
was
effected
without
any
of
the
usual
symptoms
of
a
revolution
for
as
all
well
understood
the
lieutenant
legal
claims
to
command
no
one
felt
disposed
to
dispute
his
orders
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
lundie
and
the
quartermaster
had
originally
made
a
different
disposition
and
now
for
reasons
of
his
own
the
latter
had
seen
fit
to
change
it
this
was
reasoning
enough
for
soldiers
though
the
hurt
received
by
sergeant
dunham
would
have
sufficiently
explained
the
circumstance
had
an
explanation
been
required
all
this
time
captain
sanglier
was
looking
after
his
own
breakfast
with
the
resignation
of
a
philosopher
the
coolness
of
a
veteran
the
ingenuity
and
science
of
a
frenchman
and
the
voracity
of
an
ostrich
this
person
had
now
been
in
the
colony
some
thirty
years
having
left
france
in
some
such
situation
in
his
own
army
as
muir
filled
in
the
an
iron
constitution
perfect
obduracy
of
feeling
a
certain
address
well
suited
to
manage
savages
and
an
indomitable
courage
had
early
pointed
him
out
to
the
as
a
suitable
agent
to
be
employed
in
directing
the
military
operations
of
his
indian
allies
in
this
capacity
then
he
had
risen
to
the
titular
rank
of
captain
and
with
his
promotion
had
acquired
a
portion
of
the
habits
and
opinions
of
his
associates
with
a
facility
and
an
adaptation
of
self
which
are
thought
in
america
to
be
peculiar
to
his
countrymen
he
had
often
led
parties
of
the
iroquois
in
their
predatory
expeditions
and
his
conduct
on
such
occasions
exhibited
the
contradictory
results
of
both
alleviating
the
misery
produced
by
this
species
of
warfare
and
of
augmenting
it
by
the
broader
views
and
greater
resources
of
civilization
in
other
words
he
planned
enterprises
that
in
their
importance
and
consequences
much
exceeded
the
usual
policy
of
the
indians
and
then
stepped
in
to
lessen
some
of
the
evils
of
his
own
creating
in
short
he
was
an
adventurer
whom
circumstances
had
thrown
into
a
situation
where
the
callous
qualities
of
men
of
his
class
might
readily
show
themselves
for
good
or
for
evil
and
he
was
not
of
a
character
to
baffle
fortune
by
any
squeamishness
on
the
score
of
early
impressions
or
to
trifle
with
her
liberality
by
unnecessarily
provoking
her
frowns
through
wanton
cruelty
still
as
his
name
was
unavoidably
connected
with
many
of
the
excesses
committed
by
his
parties
he
was
generally
considered
in
the
american
provinces
a
wretch
who
delighted
in
bloodshed
and
who
found
his
greatest
happiness
in
tormenting
the
helpless
and
the
innocent
and
the
name
of
sanglier
which
was
a
sobriquet
of
his
own
adopting
or
of
flint
heart
as
he
was
usually
termed
on
the
borders
had
got
to
be
as
terrible
to
the
women
and
children
of
that
part
of
the
country
as
those
of
butler
and
brandt
became
at
a
later
day
the
meeting
between
pathfinder
and
sanglier
bore
some
resemblance
to
that
celebrated
interview
between
wellington
and
blucher
which
has
been
so
often
and
graphically
told
it
took
place
at
the
fire
and
the
parties
stood
earnestly
regarding
each
other
for
more
than
a
minute
without
speaking
each
felt
that
in
the
other
he
saw
a
formidable
foe
and
each
felt
while
he
ought
to
treat
the
other
with
the
manly
liberality
due
to
a
warrior
that
there
was
little
in
common
between
them
in
the
way
of
character
as
well
as
of
interests
one
served
for
money
and
preferment
the
other
because
his
life
had
been
cast
in
the
wilderness
and
the
land
of
his
birth
needed
his
arm
and
experience
the
desire
of
rising
above
his
present
situation
never
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
pathfinder
nor
had
he
ever
known
an
ambitious
thought
as
ambition
usually
betrays
itself
until
he
became
acquainted
with
mabel
since
then
indeed
distrust
of
himself
reverence
for
her
and
the
wish
to
place
her
in
a
situation
above
that
which
he
then
filled
had
caused
him
some
uneasy
moments
but
the
directness
and
simplicity
of
his
character
had
early
afforded
the
required
relief
and
he
soon
came
to
feel
that
the
woman
who
would
not
hesitate
to
accept
him
for
her
husband
would
not
scruple
to
share
his
fortunes
however
humble
he
respected
sanglier
as
a
brave
warrior
and
he
had
far
too
much
of
that
liberality
which
is
the
result
of
practical
knowledge
to
believe
half
of
what
he
had
heard
to
his
prejudice
for
the
most
bigoted
and
illiberal
on
every
subject
are
usually
those
who
know
nothing
about
it
but
he
could
not
approve
of
his
selfishness
calculations
and
least
of
all
of
the
manner
in
which
he
forgot
his
white
gifts
to
adopt
those
that
were
purely
on
the
other
hand
pathfinder
was
a
riddle
to
captain
sanglier
the
latter
could
not
comprehend
the
motives
he
had
often
heard
of
his
disinterestedness
justice
and
truth
and
in
several
instances
they
had
led
him
into
grave
errors
on
that
principle
by
which
a
frank
and
diplomatist
is
said
to
keep
his
secrets
better
than
one
that
is
and
wily
after
the
two
heroes
had
gazed
at
each
other
in
the
manner
mentioned
monsieur
sanglier
touched
his
cap
for
the
rudeness
of
a
border
life
had
not
entirely
destroyed
the
courtesy
of
manner
he
had
acquired
in
youth
nor
extinguished
that
appearance
of
which
seems
inbred
in
a
frenchman
monsieur
le
pathfinder
said
he
with
a
very
decided
accent
though
with
a
friendly
smile
honor
courage
et
la
you
speak
iroquois
ay
i
understand
the
language
of
the
riptyles
and
can
get
along
with
it
if
there
occasion
returned
the
literal
and
guide
but
it
neither
a
tongue
nor
a
tribe
to
my
taste
wherever
you
find
the
mingo
blood
in
my
opinion
master
you
find
a
knave
well
i
seen
you
often
though
it
was
in
battle
and
i
must
say
it
was
always
in
the
van
you
must
know
most
of
our
bullets
by
sight
nevvair
sair
your
own
from
your
honorable
hand
be
sairtaine
deat
you
kill
my
best
warrior
on
some
that
may
be
that
may
be
though
i
daresay
if
the
truth
was
known
they
would
turn
out
to
be
great
rascals
no
offence
to
you
master
but
you
keep
desperate
evil
yes
sair
returned
the
frenchman
who
bent
on
saying
that
which
was
courteous
himself
and
comprehending
with
difficulty
was
disposed
to
think
he
received
a
compliment
you
too
good
but
always
what
that
mean
ha
what
that
do
the
hand
and
eye
of
captain
sanglier
directed
the
look
of
pathfinder
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
where
jasper
just
at
that
moment
had
been
rudely
seized
by
two
of
the
soldiers
who
were
binding
his
arms
under
the
direction
of
muir
what
does
that
mean
indeed
cried
the
guide
stepping
forward
and
shoving
the
two
subordinates
away
with
a
power
of
muscle
that
would
not
be
denied
who
has
the
heart
to
do
this
to
jasper
and
who
has
the
boldness
to
do
it
before
my
eyes
it
is
by
my
orders
pathfinder
answered
the
quartermaster
and
i
command
it
on
my
own
responsibility
ye
no
tak
on
yourself
to
dispute
the
legality
of
orders
given
by
one
who
bears
the
commission
to
the
king
soldiers
i
dispute
the
king
words
if
they
came
from
the
king
own
mouth
did
he
say
that
jasper
desarves
this
has
not
the
lad
just
saved
all
our
scalps
taken
us
from
defeat
and
given
us
victory
no
no
lieutenant
if
this
is
the
first
use
that
you
make
of
your
authority
i
for
one
will
not
respect
this
savors
a
little
of
insubordination
answered
muir
but
we
can
bear
much
from
pathfinder
it
is
true
this
jasper
has
to
serve
us
in
this
affair
but
we
ought
not
to
overlook
past
transactions
did
not
major
duncan
himself
denounce
him
to
sergeant
dunham
before
we
left
the
post
have
we
not
seen
sufficient
with
our
own
eyes
to
make
sure
of
having
been
betrayed
and
is
it
not
natural
and
almost
necessary
to
believe
that
this
young
man
has
been
the
traitor
ah
pathfinder
no
be
making
yourself
a
great
statesman
or
a
great
captain
if
you
put
too
much
faith
in
appearances
lord
bless
me
lord
bless
me
if
i
do
not
believe
could
the
truth
be
come
at
as
you
often
say
yourself
pathfinder
that
hypocrisy
is
a
more
common
vice
than
even
envy
and
that
the
bane
of
human
captain
sanglier
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
looked
earnestly
from
jasper
towards
the
quartermaster
and
from
the
quartermaster
towards
jasper
i
care
not
for
your
envy
or
your
hypocrisy
or
even
for
your
human
natur
returned
pathfinder
jasper
is
my
friend
jasper
is
a
brave
lad
and
an
honest
lad
and
a
loyal
lad
and
no
man
of
the
shall

you

but
you
have
none
over
jasper

me
master
ejaculated
sanglier
the
sound
partaking
equally
of
the
energies
of
the
throat
and
of
the
nose
will
ye
no
hearken
to
reason
pathfinder
ye
no
be
forgetting
our
suspicions
and
judgments
and
here
is
another
circumstance
to
augment
and
aggravate
them
all
ye
can
see
this
little
bit
of
bunting
well
where
should
it
be
found
but
by
mabel
dunham
on
the
branch
of
a
tree
on
this
very
island
just
an
hour
or
so
before
the
attack
of
the
enemy
and
if
ye
be
at
the
trouble
to
look
at
the
fly
of
the

ye
just
say
that
the

been

sanglier
between

me
of
no

when
i
know
the
heart
continued
the
pathfinder
jasper
has
the
gift
of
honesty
and
it
is
too
rare
a
gift
to
be
trifled
with
like
a
mingo
conscience
no
no

or
we
shall

which
can
make

you
overrate
your

as
much
as

underrate
bon
well
if
i
must
speak
plainly
pathfinder
i
must
captain
sanglier
here
and
arrowhead
this
brave
tuscarora
have
both
informed
me
that
this
unfortunate
boy
is
the
traitor
after
such
testimony
you
can
no
longer
oppose
my
right
to
correct
him
as
well
as
the
necessity
of
the
muttered
the

a
brave
soldier
and
will
not
gainsay
the
conduct
of
an
honest

there
any
traitor

captain
ay
added
muir
let
him
speak
out
then
since
ye
wish
it
unhappy
youth
that
the
truth
may
be
known

only
hope
that
ye
may
escape
the
last
punishment

how
is
it
captain
do
ye
or
do
ye
not

a

amang
us
yes
sair
too
much
lie
said
arrowhead
in
a
voice
of
thunder
striking
the
breast
of
muir
with
the
back
of
his
own
hand
in
a
sort
of
ungovernable
gesture
where
my
warriors
where
yengeese
scalp
too
much
lie
muir
wanted
not
for
personal
courage
nor
for
a
certain
sense
of
personal
honor
the
violence
which
had
been
intended
only
for
a
gesture
he
mistook
for
a
blow
for
conscience
was
suddenly
aroused
within
him
and
he
stepped
back
a
pace
extending
his
hand
towards
a
gun
his
face
was
livid
with
rage
and
his
countenance
expressed
the
fell
intention
of
his
heart
but
arrowhead
was
too
quick
for
him
with
a
wild
glance
of
the
eye
the
tuscarora
looked
about
him
then
thrust
a
hand
beneath
his
own
girdle
drew
forth
a
concealed
knife
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
buried
it
in
the
body
of
the
quartermaster
to
the
handle
as
the
latter
fell
at
his
feet
gazing
into
his
face
with
the
vacant
stare
of
one
surprised
by
death
sanglier
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
said
in
a
calm
voice
finie

shrugging
his
shoulders
scelerat
de
the
act
was
too
sudden
to
be
prevented
and
when
arrowhead
uttering
a
yell
bounded
into
the
bushes
the
white
men
were
too
confounded
to
follow
chingachgook
however
was
more
collected
and
the
bushes
had
scarcely
closed
on
the
passing
body
of
the
tuscarora
than
they
were
again
opened
by
that
of

jasper

spoke
french
fluently
and
the
words
and
manner
of

struck

answered
the
cool
frenchman

while
speaking
sanglier
bent
over
the
dead
body
and
thrust
his
hand
into
a
pocket
of
the
quartermaster
out
of
which
he
drew
a
purse
emptying
the
contents
on
the
ground
several
rolled
towards
the
soldiers
who
were
not
slow
in
picking
them
up

from

in
contempt
the
soldier
of
fortune
turned
towards
the
soup
he
had
been
preparing
with
so
much
care
and
finding
it
to
his
liking
he
began
to
break
his
fast
with
an
air
of
indifference
that
the
most
stoical
indian
warrior
might
have
envied
chapter

the
only

flower
on

is
virtue
the
only
lasting
treasure
truth
cowper
the
reader
must
imagine
some
of
the
occurrences
that
followed
the
sudden
death
of
muir
while
his
body
was
in
the
hands
of
his
soldiers
who
laid
it
decently
aside
and
covered
it
with
a
greatcoat
chingachgook
silently
resumed
his
place
at
the
fire
and
both
sanglier
and
pathfinder
remarked
that
he
carried
a
fresh
and
bleeding
scalp
at
his
girdle
no
one
asked
any
questions
and
the
former
although
perfectly
satisfied
that
arrowhead
had
fallen
manifested
neither
curiosity
nor
feeling
he
continued
calmly
eating
his
soup
as
if
the
meal
had
been
tranquil
as
usual
there
was
something
of
pride
and
of
an
assumed
indifference
to
fate
imitated
from
the
indians
in
all
this
but
there
was
more
that
really
resulted
from
practice
habitual
and
constitutional
hardihood
with
pathfinder
the
case
was
a
little
different
in
feeling
though
much
the
same
in
appearance
he
disliked
muir
whose
courtesy
was
little
in
accordance
with
his
own
frank
and
ingenuous
nature
but
he
had
been
shocked
at
his
unexpected
and
violent
death
though
accustomed
to
similar
scenes
and
he
had
been
surprised
at
the
exposure
of
his
treachery
with
a
view
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
latter
as
soon
as
the
body
was
removed
he
began
to
question
the
captain
on
the
subject
the
latter
having
no
particular
motive
for
secrecy
now
that
his
agent
was
dead
in
the
course
of
the
breakfast
revealed
the
following
circumstances
which
will
serve
to
clear
up
some
of
the
minor
incidents
of
our
tale
soon
after
the
appeared
on
the
frontiers
muir
had
volunteered
his
services
to
the
enemy
in
making
his
offers
he
boasted
of
his
intimacy
with
lundie
and
of
the
means
it
afforded
of
furnishing
more
accurate
and
important
information
than
usual
his
terms
had
been
accepted
and
monsieur
sanglier
had
several
interviews
with
him
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
at
oswego
and
had
actually
passed
one
entire
night
secreted
in
the
garrison
arrowhead
however
was
the
usual
channel
of
communication
and
the
anonymous
letter
to
major
duncan
had
been
originally
written
by
muir
transmitted
to
frontenac
copied
and
sent
back
by
the
tuscarora
who
was
returning
from
that
errand
when
captured
by
the
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
jasper
was
to
be
sacrificed
in
order
to
conceal
the
quartermaster
treason
and
that
the
position
of
the
island
had
been
betrayed
to
the
enemy
by
the
latter
an
extraordinary
compensation
that
which
was
found
in
his
purse
had
induced
him
to
accompany
the
party
under
sergeant
dunham
in
order
to
give
the
signals
that
were
to
bring
on
the
attack
the
disposition
of
muir
towards
the
sex
was
a
natural
weakness
and
he
would
have
married
mabel
or
any
one
else
who
would
accept
his
hand
but
his
admiration
of
her
was
in
a
great
degree
feigned
in
order
that
he
might
have
an
excuse
for
accompanying
the
party
without
sharing
in
the
responsibility
of
its
defeat
or
incurring
the
risk
of
having
no
other
strong
and
seemingly
sufficient
motive
much
of
this
was
known
to
captain
sanglier
particularly
the
part
in
connection
with
mabel
and
he
did
not
fail
to
let
his
auditors
into
the
whole
secret
frequently
laughing
in
a
sarcastic
manner
as
he
revealed
the
different
expedients
of
the
luckless
quartermaster
said
the
partisan
holding
out
his
sinewy
hand
to
pathfinder
when
he
ended
his
explanations
you
be
and
dat
is
we
tak
de
spy
as
we
tak
for
de
good
je
les
deteste
i
shake
your
hand
captain
i
will
for
you
a
lawful
and
inimy
returned
pathfinder
and
a
manful
one
but
the
body
of
the
quartermaster
shall
never
disgrace
english
ground
i
did
intend
to
carry
it
back
to
lundie
that
he
might
play
his
bagpipes
over
it
but
now
it
shall
lie
here
on
the
spot
where
he
acted
his
villainy
and
have
his
own
treason
for
a
headstone
captain
i
suppose
this
consorting
with
traitors
is
a
part
of
a
soldier
regular
business
but
i
tell
you
honestly
it
is
not
to
my
liking
and
i
rather
it
should
be
you
than
i
who
had
this
affair
on
his
conscience
what
an
awful
sinner
to
plot
right
and
left
country
friends
and
the
lord
jasper
boy
a
word
with
you
aside
for
a
single
pathfinder
now
led
the
young
man
apart
and
squeezing
his
hand
with
the
tears
in
his
own
eyes
he
continued
you
know
me
and
i
know
you
said
he
and
this
news
has
not
changed
my
opinion
of
you
in
any
manner
i
never
believed
their
tales
though
it
looked
solemn
at
one
minute
i
will
own
yes
it
did
look
solemn
and
it
made
me
feel
solemn
too
i
never
suspected
you
for
a
minute
for
i
know
your
gifts
do
lie
but
i
must
own
i
did
suspect
the
quartermaster
and
he
holding
his
majesty
commission
pathfinder
it
is
so
much
that
jasper
western
it
is
so
much
that
he
held
a
commission
from
god
to
act
right
and
to
deal
fairly
with
his
and
he
has
failed
awfully
in
his
to
think
of
his
pretending
love
for
one
like
mabel
too
when
he
felt
that
was
bad
sartainly
the
fellow
must
have
had
mingo
blood
in
his
veins
the
man
that
deals
unfairly
by
a
woman
can
be
but
a
mongrel
lad
for
the
lord
has
made
them
helpless
on
purpose
that
we
may
gain
their
love
by
kindness
and
sarvices
here
is
the
sergeant
poor
man
on
his
dying
bed
he
has
given
me
his
daughter
for
a
wife
and
mabel
dear
girl
she
has
consented
to
it
and
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
have
two
welfares
to
look
after
two
natur
to
care
for
and
two
hearts
to
gladden
ah
me
jasper
i
sometimes
feel
that
i
not
good
enough
for
that
sweet
child
had
nearly
gasped
for
breath
when
he
first
heard
this
intelligence
and
though
he
succeeded
in
suppressing
any
other
outward
signs
of
agitation
his
cheek
was
blanched
nearly
to
the
paleness
of
death
still
he
found
means
to
answer
not
only
with
firmness
but
with
energy
say
not
so
pathfinder
you
are
good
enough
for
a
ay
ay
boy
according
to
your
idees
of
my
goodness
that
is
to
say
i
can
kill
a
deer
or
even
a
mingo
at
need
with
any
man
on
the
lines
or
i
can
follow
a
with
as
true
an
eye
or
read
the
stars
when
others
do
not
understand
them
no
doubt
no
doubt
mabel
will
have
venison
enough
and
fish
enough
and
pigeons
enough
but
will
she
have
knowledge
enough
and
will
she
have
idees
enough
and
pleasant
conversation
enough
when
life
comes
to
drag
a
little
and
each
of
us
begins
to
pass
for
our
true
value
if
you
pass
for
your
value
pathfinder
the
greatest
lady
in
the
land
would
be
happy
with
you
on
that
head
you
have
no
reason
to
feel
now
jasper
i
dare
to
say
think
so
nay
i
you
do
for
it
is
and
according
to
friendship
for
people
to
look
at
them
they
love
yes
yes
if
i
had
to
marry
you
boy
i
should
give
myself
no
consarn
about
my
being
well
looked
upon
for
you
have
always
shown
a
disposition
to
see
me
and
all
i
do
with
friendly
eyes
but
a
young
gal
after
all
must
wish
to
marry
a
man
that
is
nearer
to
her
own
age
and
fancies
than
to
have
one
old
enough
to
be
her
father
and
rude
enough
to
frighten
her
i
wonder
jasper
that
mabel
never
took
a
fancy
to
you
now
rather
than
setting
her
mind
on
take
a
fancy
to
me
pathfinder
returned
the
young
man
endeavoring
to
clear
his
voice
without
betraying
himself
what
is
there
about
me
to
please
such
a
girl
as
mabel
dunham
i
have
all
that
you
find
fault
with
in
yourself
with
none
of
that
excellence
that
makes
even
the
generals
respect
well
well
it
all
chance
say
what
we
will
about
it
here
have
i
journeyed
and
guided
through
the
woods
female
after
female
and
consorted
with
them
in
the
garrisons
and
never
have
i
even
felt
an
inclination
for
any
until
i
saw
mabel
dunham
it
true
the
poor
sergeant
first
set
me
to
thinking
about
his
daughter
but
after
we
got
a
little
acquainted
like
i
no
need
of
being
spoken
to
to
think
of
her
night
and
day
i
tough
jasper
yes
i
very
tough
and
i
risolute
enough
as
you
all
know
and
yet
i
do
think
it
would
quite
break
me
down
now
to
lose
mabel
dunham
we
will
talk
no
more
of
it
pathfinder
said
jasper
returning
his
friend
squeeze
of
the
hand
and
moving
back
towards
the
fire
though
slowly
and
in
the
manner
of
one
who
cared
little
where
he
went
we
will
talk
no
more
of
it
you
are
worthy
of
mabel
and
mabel
is
worthy
of
you
you
like
mabel
and
mabel
likes
you
her
father
has
chosen
you
for
her
husband
and
no
one
has
a
right
to
interfere
as
for
the
quartermaster
his
feigning
love
for
mabel
is
worse
even
than
his
treason
to
the
by
this
time
they
were
so
near
the
fire
that
it
was
necessary
to
change
the
conversation
luckily
at
that
instant
cap
who
had
been
in
the
block
in
company
with
his
dying
and
who
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
since
the
capitulation
now
appeared
walking
with
a
meditative
and
melancholy
air
towards
the
group
much
of
that
hearty
dogmatism
that
imparted
even
to
his
ordinary
air
and
demeanor
an
appearance
of
something
like
contempt
for
all
around
him
had
disappeared
and
he
seemed
thoughtful
if
not
meek
this
death
gentlemen
said
he
when
he
had
got
sufficiently
near
is
a
melancholy
business
make
the
best
of
it
now
here
is
sergeant
dunham
a
very
good
soldier
i
make
no
question
about
to
slip
his
cable
and
yet
he
holds
on
to
the
better
end
of
it
as
if
he
was
determined
it
should
never
run
out
of
the
and
all
because
he
loves
his
daughter
it
seems
to
me
for
my
part
when
a
friend
is
really
under
the
necessity
of
making
a
long
journey
i
always
wish
him
well
and
happily
you
would
kill
the
sergeant
before
his
time
pathfinder
reproachfully
answered
life
is
sweet
even
to
the
aged
and
for
that
matter
i
known
some
that
seemed
to
set
much
store
by
it
when
it
got
to
be
of
the
least
nothing
had
been
further
from
cap
real
thoughts
than
the
wish
to
hasten
his
end
he
had
found
himself
embarrassed
with
the
duties
of
smoothing
a
deathbed
and
all
he
had
meant
was
to
express
a
sincere
desire
that
the
sergeant
were
happily
rid
of
doubt
and
suffering
a
little
shocked
therefore
at
the
interpretation
that
had
been
put
on
his
words
he
rejoined
with
some
of
the
asperity
of
the
man
though
rebuked
by
a
consciousness
of
not
having
done
his
own
wishes
justice
you
are
too
old
and
too
sensible
a
person
pathfinder
said
he
to
fetch
a
man
up
with
a
surge
when
he
is
paying
out
his
ideas
in
distress
as
it
might
be
sergeant
dunham
is
both
my
and
my
friend
that
is
to
say
as
intimate
a
friend
as
a
soldier
well
can
be
with
a
seafaring
man
and
i
respect
and
honor
him
accordingly
i
make
no
doubt
moreover
that
he
has
lived
such
a
life
as
becomes
a
man
and
there
can
be
no
great
harm
after
all
in
wishing
any
one
well
berthed
in
heaven
well
we
are
mortal
the
best
of
us
that
you
not
deny
and
it
ought
to
be
a
lesson
not
to
feel
pride
in
our
strength
and
beauty
where
is
the
quartermaster
pathfinder
it
is
proper
he
should
come
and
have
a
parting
word
with
the
poor
sergeant
who
is
only
going
a
little
before
you
have
spoken
more
truth
master
cap
than
you
been
knowing
to
all
this
time
you
might
have
gone
further
notwithstanding
and
said
that
we
are
mortal
the
of
us
which
is
quite
as
true
and
a
good
deal
more
wholesome
than
saying
that
we
are
mortal
the
of
us
as
for
the
quartermaster
coming
to
speak
a
parting
word
to
the
sergeant
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
seeing
that
he
has
gone
ahead
and
that
too
with
little
parting
notice
to
himself
or
to
any
one
you
are
not
quite
so
clear
as
common
in
your
language
pathfinder
i
know
that
we
ought
all
to
have
solemn
thoughts
on
these
occasions
but
i
see
no
use
in
speaking
in
if
my
words
are
not
plain
the
idee
is
in
short
master
cap
while
sergeant
dunham
has
been
preparing
himself
for
a
long
journey
like
a
conscientious
and
honest
man
as
he
is
deliberately
the
quartermaster
has
started
in
a
hurry
before
him
and
although
it
is
a
matter
on
which
it
does
not
become
me
to
be
very
positive
i
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
they
travel
such
different
roads
that
they
will
never
explain
yourself
my
friend
said
the
bewildered
seaman
looking
around
him
in
search
of
muir
whose
absence
began
to
excite
his
distrust
i
see
nothing
of
the
quartermaster
but
i
think
him
too
much
of
a
man
to
run
away
now
that
the
victory
is
gained
if
the
fight
were
ahead
instead
of
in
our
wake
the
case
would
be
there
lies
all
that
is
left
of
him
beneath
that
greatcoat
returned
the
guide
who
then
briefly
related
the
manner
of
the
death
the
tuscarora
was
as
venemous
in
his
blow
as
a
rattler
though
he
failed
to
give
the
warning
continued
pathfinder
i
seen
many
a
desperate
fight
and
several
of
these
sudden
outbreaks
of
savage
temper
but
never
before
did
i
see
a
human
soul
quit
the
body
more
unexpectedly
or
at
a
worse
moment
for
the
hopes
of
the
dying
man
his
breath
was
stopped
with
the
lie
on
his
lips
and
the
spirit
might
be
said
to
have
passed
away
in
the
very
ardor
of
cap
listened
with
a
gaping
mouth
and
he
gave
two
or
three
violent
hems
as
the
other
concluded
like
one
who
distrusted
his
own
respiration
this
is
an
uncertain
and
uncomfortable
life
of
yours
master
pathfinder
what
between
the
fresh
water
and
the
savages
said
he
and
the
sooner
i
get
quit
of
it
the
higher
will
be
my
opinion
of
myself
now
you
mention
it
i
will
say
that
the
man
ran
for
that
berth
in
the
rocks
when
the
enemy
first
bore
down
upon
us
with
a
sort
of
instinct
that
i
thought
surprising
in
an
officer
but
i
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
follow
to
log
the
whole
matter
accurately
god
bless
me
god
bless
me
a
traitor
do
you
say
and
ready
to
sell
his
country
and
to
a
rascally
frenchman
too
to
sell
anything
country
soul
body
mabel
and
all
our
scalps
and
no
ways
particular
i
engage
as
to
the
purchaser
the
countrymen
of
captain
here
were
the
paymasters
this
just
like
ever
ready
to
buy
when
they
ca
thrash
and
to
run
when
they
can
do
monsieur
sanglier
lifted
his
cap
with
ironical
gravity
and
acknowledged
the
compliment
with
an
expression
of
polite
contempt
that
was
altogether
lost
on
its
insensible
subject
but
pathfinder
had
too
much
native
courtesy
and
was
far
too
to
allow
the
attack
to
go
unnoticed
well
well
he
interposed
to
my
mind
there
is
no
great
difference
an
englishman
and
a
frenchman
after
all
they
talk
different
tongues
and
live
under
different
kings
i
will
allow
but
both
are
human
and
feel
like
human
beings
when
there
is
occasion
for
captain
as
pathfinder
called
him
made
another
obeisance
but
this
time
the
smile
was
friendly
and
not
ironical
for
he
felt
that
the
intention
was
good
whatever
might
have
been
the
mode
of
expressing
it
too
philosophical
however
to
heed
what
a
man
like
cap
might
say
or
think
he
finished
his
breakfast
without
allowing
his
attention
to
be
again
diverted
from
that
important
pursuit
my
business
here
was
principally
with
the
quartermaster
cap
continued
as
soon
as
he
had
done
regarding
the
prisoner
pantomime
the
sergeant
must
be
near
his
end
and
i
have
thought
he
might
wish
to
say
something
to
his
successor
in
authority
before
he
finally
departed
it
is
too
late
it
would
seem
and
as
you
say
pathfinder
the
lieutenant
has
truly
gone
that
he
has
though
on
a
different
path
as
for
authority
i
suppose
the
corporal
has
now
a
right
to
command
what
left
of
the
though
a
small
and
worried
not
to
say
frightened
party
it
is
but
if
anything
needs
to
be
done
the
chances
are
greatly
in
favor
of
my
being
called
on
to
do
it
i
suppose
however
we
have
only
to
bury
our
dead
set
fire
to
the
block
and
the
huts
for
they
stand
in
the
territory
by
position
if
not
by
law
and
must
not
be
left
for
their
convenience
our
using
them
again
is
out
of
the
question
for
now
the
frenchers
know
where
the
island
is
to
be
found
it
would
be
like
thrusting
the
hand
into
a
with
our
eyes
wide
open
this
part
of
the
work
the
sarpent
and
i
will
see
to
for
we
are
as
practysed
in
retreats
as
in
all
that
is
very
well
my
good
friend
and
now
for
my
poor
though
he
is
a
soldier
we
can
not
let
him
slip
without
a
word
of
consolation
and
a
in
my
judgment
this
has
been
an
unlucky
affair
on
every
tack
though
i
suppose
it
is
what
one
had
a
right
to
expect
considering
the
state
of
the
times
and
the
nature
of
the
navigation
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
and
try
to
help
the
worthy
man
to
unmoor
without
straining
his
messengers
death
is
a
circumstance
after
all
master
pathfinder
and
one
of
a
very
general
character
too
seeing
that
we
must
all
submit
to
it
sooner
or
you
say
truth
you
say
truth
and
for
that
reason
i
hold
it
to
be
wise
to
be
always
ready
i
often
thought
saltwater
that
he
is
the
happiest
who
has
the
least
to
leave
behind
him
when
the
summons
comes
now
here
am
i
a
hunter
and
a
scout
and
a
guide
although
i
do
not
own
a
foot
of
land
on
yet
do
i
enjoy
and
possess
more
than
the
great
albany
patroon
with
the
heavens
over
my
head
to
keep
me
in
mind
of
the
last
great
hunt
and
the
dried
leaves
beneath
my
feet
i
tramp
over
the
ground
as
freely
as
if
i
was
its
lord
and
owner
and
what
more
need
heart
desire
i
do
not
say
that
i
love
nothing
that
belongs
to
for
i
do
though
not
much
unless
it
might
be
mabel
dunham
that
i
ca
carry
with
me
i
have
some
pups
at
the
higher
fort
that
i
vally
considerable
though
they
are
too
noisy
for
warfare
and
so
we
are
compelled
to
live
separate
for
awhile
and
then
i
think
it
would
grieve
me
to
part
with
killdeer
but
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
for
we
are
as
near
as
can
be
of
the
same
length
six
feet
to
a
hair
breadth
but
bating
these
and
a
pipe
that
the
sarpent
gave
me
and
a
few
tokens
received
from
travellers
all
of
which
might
be
put
in
a
pouch
and
laid
under
my
head
when
the
order
comes
to
march
i
shall
be
ready
at
a
minute
warning
and
let
me
tell
you
master
cap
that
what
i
call
a
circumstance
is
just
so
with
me
answered
the
sailor
as
the
two
walked
towards
the
block
too
much
occupied
with
their
respective
morality
to
remember
at
the
moment
the
melancholy
errand
they
were
on
that
just
my
way
of
feeling
and
reasoning
how
often
have
i
felt
when
near
shipwreck
the
relief
of
not
owning
the
craft
she
goes
i
have
said
to
myself
my
life
goes
with
her
but
not
my
property
and
there
great
comfort
in
that
i
discovered
in
the
course
of
boxing
about
the
world
from
the
horn
to
cape
north
not
to
speak
of
this
run
on
a
bit
of
fresh
water
that
if
a
man
has
a
few
dollars
and
puts
them
in
a
chest
under
lock
and
key
he
is
pretty
certain
to
fasten
up
his
heart
in
the
same
till
and
so
i
carry
pretty
much
all
i
own
in
a
belt
round
my
body
in
order
as
i
say
to
keep
the
vitals
in
the
right
place
d
pathfinder
if
i
think
a
man
without
a
heart
any
better
than
a
fish
with
a
hole
in
his
i
do
know
how
that
may
be
master
cap
but
a
man
without
a
conscience
is
but
a
poor
creatur
take
my
word
for
it
as
any
one
will
discover
who
has
to
do
with
a
mingo
i
trouble
myself
but
little
with
dollars
or
for
these
are
the
favoryte
coin
in
this
part
of
the
world
but
i
can
easily
believe
by
what
i
seen
of
mankind
that
if
a
man
a
chest
filled
with
either
he
may
be
said
to
lock
up
his
heart
in
the
same
box
i
once
hunted
for
two
summers
during
the
last
peace
and
i
collected
so
much
peltry
that
i
found
my
right
feelings
giving
way
to
a
craving
after
property
and
if
i
have
consarn
in
marrying
mabel
it
is
that
i
may
get
to
love
such
things
too
well
in
order
to
make
her
you
a
philosopher
that
clear
pathfinder
and
i
do
know
but
you
a
i
should
be
out
of
humor
with
the
man
that
gainsayed
the
last
master
cap
i
have
not
been
christianized
by
the
moravians
like
so
many
of
the
delawares
it
is
true
but
i
hold
to
christianity
and
white
gifts
with
me
it
is
as
for
a
white
man
not
to
be
a
christian
as
it
is
for
a
not
to
believe
in
his
happy
indeed
after
allowing
for
difference
in
traditions
and
in
some
variations
about
the
manner
in
which
the
spirit
will
be
occupied
after
death
i
hold
that
a
good
delaware
is
a
good
christian
though
he
never
saw
a
moravian
and
a
good
christian
a
good
delaware
so
far
as
natur
consarned
the
sarpent
and
i
talk
these
matters
over
often
for
he
has
a
hankerin
after
christianity
the
d
he
has
interrupted
cap
and
what
does
he
intend
to
do
in
a
church
with
all
the
scalps
he
takes
do
run
away
with
a
false
idee
friend
cap
do
run
away
with
a
false
idee
these
things
are
only
and
all
depend
on
edication
and
gifts
look
around
you
at
mankind
and
tell
me
why
you
see
a
red
warrior
here
a
black
one
there
and
white
armies
in
another
place
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
of
the
same
kind
that
i
could
point
out
has
been
ordered
for
some
special
purpose
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
fly
in
the
face
of
facts
and
deny
their
truth
no
no
each
color
has
its
gifts
and
its
laws
and
its
traditions
and
one
is
not
to
condemn
another
because
he
does
not
exactly
comprehend
you
must
have
read
a
great
deal
pathfinder
to
see
things
so
clear
as
this
returned
cap
not
a
little
mystified
by
his
companion
simple
creed
it
all
as
plain
as
day
to
me
now
though
i
must
say
i
never
fell
in
with
these
opinions
before
what
denomination
do
you
belong
to
my
friend
anan
what
sect
do
you
hold
out
for
what
particular
church
do
you
fetch
up
in
look
about
you
and
judge
for
yourself
i
in
church
now
i
eat
in
church
drink
in
church
sleep
in
church
the
is
the
temple
of
the
lord
and
i
wait
on
him
hourly
daily
without
ceasing
i
humbly
hope
no
no
i
not
deny
my
blood
and
color
but
am
christian
born
and
shall
die
in
the
same
faith
the
moravians
tried
me
hard
and
one
of
the
king
chaplains
has
had
his
say
too
though
that
a
class
no
ways
strenuous
on
such
matters
and
a
missionary
sent
from
rome
talked
much
with
me
as
i
guided
him
through
the
forest
during
the
last
peace
but
i
had
one
answer
for
them
all
i
a
christian
already
and
want
to
be
neither
moravian
nor
churchman
nor
papist
no
no
i
not
deny
my
birth
and
i
think
a
word
from
you
might
lighten
the
sergeant
over
the
shoals
of
death
master
pathfinder
he
has
no
one
with
him
but
poor
mabel
and
she
you
know
besides
being
his
daughter
is
but
a
girl
and
a
child
after
mabel
is
feeble
in
body
friend
cap
but
in
matters
of
this
natur
i
doubt
if
she
may
not
be
stronger
than
most
men
but
sergeant
dunham
is
my
friend
and
he
is
your
so
now
the
press
of
fighting
and
maintaining
our
rights
is
over
it
is
fitting
we
should
both
go
and
witness
his
departure
i
stood
by
many
a
dying
man
master
cap
continued
pathfinder
who
had
a
besetting
propensity
to
enlarge
on
his
experience
stopping
and
holding
his
companion
by
a
button
i
stood
by
many
a
dying
man
side
and
seen
his
last
gasp
and
heard
his
last
breath
for
when
the
hurry
and
tumult
of
the
battle
is
over
it
is
good
to
bethink
us
of
the
misfortunate
and
it
is
remarkable
to
witness
how
differently
human
natur
feels
at
such
solemn
moments
some
go
their
way
as
stupid
and
ignorant
as
if
god
had
never
given
them
reason
and
an
accountable
state
while
others
quit
us
rejoicing
like
men
who
leave
heavy
burthens
behind
them
i
think
that
the
mind
sees
clearly
at
such
moments
my
friend
and
that
past
deeds
stand
thick
before
the
i
engage
they
do
pathfinder
i
have
witnessed
something
of
this
myself
and
hope
i
the
better
man
for
it
i
remember
once
that
i
thought
my
own
time
had
come
and
the
log
was
overhauled
with
a
diligence
i
did
not
think
myself
capable
of
until
that
moment
i
not
been
a
very
great
sinner
friend
pathfinder
that
is
to
say
never
on
a
large
scale
though
i
daresay
if
the
truth
were
spoken
a
considerable
amount
of
small
matters
might
be
raked
up
against
me
as
well
as
against
another
man
but
then
i
never
committed
piracy
nor
high
treason
nor
arson
nor
any
of
them
sort
of
things
as
to
smuggling
and
the
like
of
that
why
i
a
seafaring
man
and
i
suppose
all
callings
have
their
weak
spots
i
daresay
your
trade
is
not
altogether
without
blemish
honorable
and
useful
as
it
seems
to
be
many
of
the
scouts
and
guides
are
desperate
knaves
and
like
the
quartermaster
here
some
of
them
take
pay
of
both
sides
i
hope
i
not
one
of
them
though
all
occupations
lead
to
temptations
thrice
have
i
been
sorely
tried
in
my
life
and
once
i
yielded
a
little
though
i
hope
it
was
not
in
a
matter
to
disturb
a
man
conscience
in
his
last
moments
the
first
time
was
when
i
found
in
the
woods
a
pack
of
skins
that
i
knowed
belonged
to
a
frencher
who
was
hunting
on
our
side
of
the
lines
where
he
had
no
business
to
be
as
handsome
beavers
as
ever
gladdened
human
eyes
well
that
was
a
sore
temptation
for
i
thought
the
law
would
have
been
almost
with
me
although
it
was
in
peace
times
but
then
i
remembered
that
such
laws
was
made
for
us
hunters
and
bethought
me
that
the
poor
man
might
have
built
great
expectations
for
the
next
winter
on
the
sale
of
his
skins
and
i
left
them
where
they
lay
most
of
our
people
said
i
did
wrong
but
the
manner
in
which
i
slept
that
night
convinced
me
that
i
had
done
right
the
next
trial
was
when
i
found
the
rifle
that
is
sartainly
the
only
one
in
this
part
of
the
world
that
can
be
calculated
on
as
surely
as
killdeer
and
knowed
that
by
taking
it
or
even
hiding
it
i
might
at
once
rise
to
be
the
first
shot
in
all
these
parts
i
was
then
young
and
by
no
means
so
expart
as
i
have
since
got
to
be
and
youth
is
ambitious
and
striving
but
god
be
praised
i
mastered
that
feeling
and
friend
cap
what
is
almost
as
good
i
mastered
my
rival
in
as
fair
a
as
was
ever
witnessed
in
a
garrison
he
with
his
piece
and
i
with
killdeer
and
before
the
general
in
person
too
here
pathfinder
stopped
to
laugh
his
triumph
still
glittering
in
his
eyes
and
glowing
on
his
sunburnt
and
browned
cheek
well
the
next
conflict
with
the
devil
was
the
hardest
of
them
all
and
that
was
when
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
camp
of
six
mingos
asleep
in
the
woods
with
their
guns
and
horns
piled
in
away
that
enabled
me
to
get
possession
of
them
without
waking
a
miscreant
of
them
all
what
an
opportunity
that
would
have
been
for
the
sarpent
who
would
have
despatched
them
one
after
another
with
his
knife
and
had
their
six
scalps
at
his
girdle
in
about
the
time
it
takes
me
to
tell
you
the
story
oh
he
a
valiant
warrior
that
chingachgook
and
as
honest
as
he
brave
and
as
good
as
he
honest
and
what
may
have
done
in
this
matter
master
pathfinder
demanded
cap
who
began
to
be
interested
in
the
result
it
seems
to
me
you
had
made
either
a
very
lucky
or
a
very
unlucky
was
lucky
and
was
unlucky
if
you
can
understand
that
was
unlucky
for
it
proved
a
desperate
trial
and
yet
was
lucky
all
things
considered
in
the
ind
i
did
not
touch
a
hair
of
their
heads
for
a
white
man
has
no
gifts
to
take
scalps
nor
did
i
even
make
sure
of
one
of
their
rifles
i
distrusted
myself
knowing
that
a
mingo
is
no
favorite
in
my
own
as
for
the
scalps
i
think
you
were
right
enough
my
worthy
friend
but
as
for
the
armament
and
the
stores
they
would
have
been
condemned
by
any
in
that
they
would
that
they
would
but
then
the
mingos
would
have
gone
clear
seeing
that
a
white
man
can
no
more
attack
an
unarmed
than
a
sleeping
inimy
no
no
i
did
myself
and
my
color
and
my
religion
too
greater
justice
i
waited
till
their
nap
was
over
and
they
well
on
their
again
and
by
ambushing
them
here
and
flanking
them
there
i
peppered
the
blackguards
intrinsically
like
pathfinder
occasionally
caught
a
fine
word
from
his
associates
and
used
it
a
little
vaguely
that
only
one
ever
got
back
to
his
village
and
he
came
into
his
wigwam
limping
luckily
as
it
turned
out
the
great
delaware
had
only
halted
to
jerk
some
venison
and
was
following
on
my
trail
and
when
he
got
up
he
had
five
of
the
scoundrels
scalps
hanging
where
they
ought
to
be
so
you
see
nothing
was
lost
by
doing
right
either
in
the
way
of
honor
or
in
that
of
cap
grunted
an
assent
though
the
distinctions
in
his
morality
it
must
be
owned
were
not
exactly
clear
to
his
understanding
the
two
had
occasionally
moved
towards
the
block
as
they
conversed
and
then
stopped
again
as
some
matter
of
more
interest
than
common
brought
them
to
a
halt
they
were
now
so
near
the
building
however
that
neither
thought
of
pursuing
the
subject
any
further
but
each
prepared
himself
for
the
final
scene
with
sergeant
dunham
chapter
xxviii
thou
barraine
ground
whom
winter
wrath
hath
wasted
art
made
a
mirror
to
behold
my
plight
whilome
thy
fresh
spring
flower
and
after
hasted
thy
summer
prowde
with
daffodillies
dight
and
now
is
come
thy
winter
stormy
state
thy
mantle
mar
wherein
thou
maskedst
late
spenser
although
the
soldier
may
regard
danger
and
even
death
with
indifference
in
the
tumult
of
battle
when
the
passage
of
the
soul
is
delayed
to
moments
of
tranquillity
and
reflection
the
change
commonly
brings
with
it
the
usual
train
of
solemn
reflections
of
regrets
for
the
past
and
of
doubts
and
anticipations
for
the
future
many
a
man
has
died
with
a
heroic
expression
on
his
lips
but
with
heaviness
and
distrust
at
his
heart
for
whatever
may
be
the
varieties
of
our
religious
creeds
let
us
depend
on
the
mediation
of
christ
the
dogmas
of
mahomet
or
the
elaborated
allegories
of
the
east
there
is
a
conviction
common
to
all
men
that
death
is
but
the
between
this
and
a
more
elevated
state
of
being
sergeant
dunham
was
a
brave
man
but
he
was
departing
for
a
country
in
which
resolution
could
avail
him
nothing
and
as
he
felt
himself
gradually
loosened
from
the
grasp
of
the
world
his
thoughts
and
feelings
took
the
natural
direction
for
if
it
be
true
that
death
is
the
great
leveller
in
nothing
is
it
more
true
than
that
it
reduces
all
to
the
same
views
of
the
vanity
of
life
pathfinder
though
a
man
of
peculiar
habits
and
opinions
was
always
thoughtful
and
disposed
to
view
the
things
around
him
with
a
shade
of
philosophy
as
well
as
with
seriousness
in
him
therefore
the
scene
in
the
blockhouse
awakened
no
very
novel
feelings
but
the
case
was
different
with
cap
rude
opinionated
dogmatical
and
boisterous
the
old
sailor
was
little
accustomed
to
view
even
death
with
any
approach
to
the
gravity
which
its
importance
demands
and
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
and
his
real
regard
for
his
he
now
entered
the
room
of
the
dying
man
with
much
of
that
callous
unconcern
which
was
the
fruit
of
long
training
in
a
school
that
while
it
gives
so
many
lessons
in
the
sublimest
truths
generally
wastes
its
admonitions
on
scholars
who
are
little
disposed
to
profit
by
them
the
first
proof
that
cap
gave
of
his
not
entering
so
fully
as
those
around
him
into
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
was
by
commencing
a
narration
of
the
events
which
had
just
led
to
the
deaths
of
muir
and
arrowhead
both
tripped
their
anchors
in
a
hurry
brother
dunham
he
concluded
and
you
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
others
have
gone
before
you
in
the
great
journey
and
they
too
men
whom
you
no
particular
reason
to
love
which
to
me
were
i
placed
in
your
situation
would
be
a
source
of
very
great
satisfaction
my
mother
always
said
master
pathfinder
that
dying
people
spirits
should
not
be
damped
but
that
they
ought
to
be
encouraged
by
all
proper
and
prudent
means
and
this
news
will
give
the
poor
fellow
a
great
lift
if
he
feels
towards
them
savages
any
way
as
i
feel
june
arose
at
this
intelligence
and
stole
from
the
blockhouse
with
a
noiseless
step
dunham
listened
with
a
vacant
stare
for
life
had
already
lost
so
many
of
its
ties
that
he
had
really
forgotten
arrowhead
and
cared
nothing
for
muir
but
he
inquired
in
a
feeble
voice
for
the
young
man
was
immediately
summoned
and
soon
made
his
appearance
the
sergeant
gazed
at
him
kindly
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
was
that
of
regret
for
the
injury
he
had
done
him
in
thought
the
party
in
the
blockhouse
now
consisted
of
pathfinder
cap
mabel
jasper
and
the
dying
man
with
the
exception
of
the
daughter
all
stood
around
the
sergeant
pallet
in
attendance
in
his
last
moments
mabel
kneeled
at
his
side
now
pressing
a
clammy
hand
to
her
head
now
applying
moisture
to
the
parched
lips
of
her
father
your
case
will
shortly
be
ourn
sergeant
said
pathfinder
who
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
awestruck
by
the
scene
for
he
had
witnessed
the
approach
and
victories
of
death
too
often
for
that
but
who
felt
the
full
difference
between
his
triumphs
in
the
excitement
of
battle
and
in
the
quiet
of
the
domestic
circle
and
i
make
no
question
we
shall
meet
hereafter
arrowhead
has
gone
his
way
is
true
but
it
can
never
be
the
way
of
a
just
indian
you
seen
the
last
of
him
for
his
path
can
not
be
the
path
of
the
just
reason
is
the
thought
in
his
case
as
it
is
also
in
my
judgment
it
too
in
the
case
of
lieutenant
muir
you
have
done
your
duty
in
life
and
when
a
man
does
that
he
may
start
on
the
longest
journey
with
a
light
heart
and
an
actyve
i
hope
so
my
friend
i
tried
to
do
my
ay
ay
put
in
cap
intention
is
half
the
battle
and
though
you
would
have
done
better
had
you
in
the
offing
and
sent
a
craft
in
to
feel
how
the
land
lay
things
might
have
turned
out
differently
no
one
here
doubts
that
you
meant
all
for
the
best
and
no
one
anywhere
else
i
should
think
from
what
i
seen
of
this
world
and
read
of
i
did
yes
i
meant
all
for
the
father
oh
my
beloved
father
magnet
is
taken
aback
by
this
blow
master
pathfinder
and
can
say
or
do
but
little
to
carry
her
father
over
the
shoals
so
we
must
try
all
the
harder
to
serve
him
a
friendly
turn
did
you
speak
mabel
dunham
asked
turning
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
his
daughter
for
he
was
already
too
feeble
to
turn
his
body
yes
father
rely
on
nothing
you
have
done
yourself
for
mercy
and
salvation
trust
altogether
in
the
blessed
mediation
of
the
son
of
god
the
chaplain
has
told
us
something
like
this
brother
the
dear
child
may
be
ay
ay
that
doctrine
out
of
question
he
will
be
our
judge
and
keeps
the
of
our
acts
and
will
foot
them
all
up
at
the
last
day
and
then
say
who
has
done
well
and
who
has
done
ill
i
do
believe
mabel
is
right
but
then
you
need
not
be
concerned
as
no
doubt
the
account
has
been
fairly
uncle
dearest
father
this
is
a
vain
illusion
oh
place
all
your
trust
in
the
mediation
of
our
holy
redeemer
have
you
not
often
felt
your
own
insufficiency
to
effect
your
own
wishes
in
the
commonest
things
and
how
can
you
imagine
yourself
by
your
own
acts
equal
to
raise
up
a
frail
and
sinful
nature
sufficiently
to
be
received
into
the
presence
of
perfect
purity
there
is
no
hope
for
any
but
in
the
mediation
of
christ
this
is
what
the
moravians
used
to
tell
us
said
pathfinder
to
cap
in
a
low
voice
rely
on
it
mabel
is
right
enough
friend
pathfinder
in
the
distances
but
wrong
in
the
course
i
afraid
the
child
will
get
the
sergeant
adrift
at
the
very
moment
when
we
had
him
in
the
best
of
the
water
and
in
the
plainest
part
of
the
leave
it
to
mabel
leave
it
to
mabel
she
knows
better
than
any
of
us
and
can
do
no
i
have
heard
this
before
dunham
at
length
replied
ah
mabel
it
is
strange
for
the
parent
to
lean
on
the
child
at
a
moment
like
this
put
your
trust
in
god
father
lean
on
his
holy
and
compassionate
son
pray
dearest
dearest
father
pray
for
his
omnipotent
i
am
not
used
to
prayer
brother
pathfinder
jasper
can
you
help
me
to
words
cap
scarcely
knew
what
prayer
meant
and
he
had
no
answer
to
give
pathfinder
prayed
often
daily
if
not
hourly
but
it
was
mentally
in
his
own
simple
modes
of
thinking
and
without
the
aid
of
words
at
all
in
this
strait
therefore
he
was
as
useless
as
the
mariner
and
had
no
reply
to
make
as
for
jasper
though
he
would
gladly
have
endeavored
to
move
a
mountain
to
relieve
mabel
this
was
asking
assistance
it
exceeded
his
power
to
give
and
he
shrank
back
with
the
shame
that
is
only
too
apt
to
overcome
the
young
and
vigorous
when
called
on
to
perform
an
act
that
tacitly
confesses
their
real
weakness
and
dependence
on
a
superior
power
father
said
mabel
wiping
her
eyes
and
endeavoring
to
compose
features
that
were
pallid
and
actually
quivering
with
emotion
i
will
pray
with
you
for
you
for
for
us
the
petition
of
the
feeblest
and
humblest
is
never
there
was
something
sublime
as
well
as
much
that
was
supremely
touching
in
this
act
of
filial
piety
the
quiet
but
earnest
manner
in
which
this
young
creature
prepared
herself
to
perform
the
duty
the
with
which
she
forgot
her
sex
timidity
and
shame
in
order
to
sustain
her
parent
at
that
trying
moment
the
loftiness
of
purpose
with
which
she
directed
all
her
powers
to
the
immense
object
before
her
with
a
woman
devotion
and
a
superiority
to
trifles
when
her
affections
make
the
appeal
and
the
holy
calm
into
which
her
grief
was
compressed
rendered
her
for
the
moment
an
object
of
something
very
like
awe
and
veneration
to
her
companions
mabel
had
been
religiously
educated
equally
without
exaggeration
and
without
her
reliance
on
god
was
cheerful
and
full
of
hope
while
it
was
of
the
humblest
and
most
dependent
nature
she
had
been
accustomed
from
childhood
to
address
herself
to
the
deity
in
prayer
taking
example
from
the
divine
mandate
of
christ
himself
who
commanded
his
followers
to
abstain
from
vain
repetitions
and
who
has
left
behind
him
a
petition
which
is
unequalled
for
sublimity
as
if
expressly
to
rebuke
the
disposition
of
man
to
set
up
his
own
loose
and
random
thoughts
as
the
most
acceptable
sacrifice
the
sect
in
which
she
had
been
reared
has
furnished
to
its
followers
some
of
the
most
beautiful
compositions
in
the
language
as
a
suitable
vehicle
for
its
devotion
and
solicitations
accustomed
to
this
mode
of
public
and
even
private
prayer
the
mind
of
our
heroine
had
naturally
fallen
into
its
train
of
lofty
thought
her
task
had
become
improved
by
its
study
and
her
language
elevated
and
enriched
by
its
phrases
when
she
kneeled
at
the
bedside
of
her
father
the
very
reverence
of
her
attitude
and
manner
prepared
the
spectators
for
what
was
to
come
and
as
her
affectionate
heart
prompted
her
tongue
and
memory
came
in
aid
of
both
the
petition
and
praises
that
she
offered
up
were
of
a
character
which
might
have
worthily
led
the
spirits
of
angels
although
the
words
were
not
slavishly
borrowed
the
expressions
partook
of
the
simple
dignity
of
the
liturgy
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
and
was
probably
as
worthy
of
the
being
to
whom
they
were
addressed
as
they
could
well
be
made
by
human
powers
they
produced
their
full
impression
on
the
hearers
for
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
notwithstanding
the
pernicious
effects
of
a
false
taste
when
long
submitted
to
real
sublimity
and
beauty
are
so
closely
allied
to
nature
that
they
generally
find
an
echo
in
every
heart
but
when
our
heroine
came
to
touch
upon
the
situation
of
the
dying
man
she
became
the
most
truly
persuasive
for
then
she
was
the
most
truly
zealous
and
natural
the
beauty
of
the
language
was
preserved
but
it
was
sustained
by
the
simple
power
of
love
and
her
words
were
warmed
by
a
holy
zeal
that
approached
to
the
grandeur
of
true
eloquence
we
might
record
some
of
her
expressions
but
doubt
the
propriety
of
subjecting
such
sacred
themes
to
a
too
familiar
analysis
and
refrain
the
effect
of
this
singular
but
solemn
scene
was
different
on
the
different
individuals
present
dunham
himself
was
soon
lost
in
the
subject
of
the
prayer
and
he
felt
some
such
relief
as
one
who
finds
himself
staggering
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
under
a
burthen
difficult
to
be
borne
might
be
supposed
to
experience
when
he
unexpectedly
feels
the
weight
removed
in
order
to
be
placed
on
the
shoulders
of
another
better
able
to
sustain
it
cap
was
surprised
as
well
as
awed
though
the
effects
on
his
mind
were
not
very
deep
or
very
lasting
he
wondered
a
little
at
his
own
sensations
and
had
his
doubts
whether
they
were
so
manly
and
heroic
as
they
ought
to
be
but
he
was
far
too
sensible
of
the
influence
of
truth
humility
religious
submission
and
human
dependency
to
think
of
interposing
with
any
of
his
crude
objections
jasper
knelt
opposite
to
mabel
covered
his
face
and
followed
her
words
with
an
earnest
wish
to
aid
her
prayers
with
his
own
though
it
may
be
questioned
if
his
thoughts
did
not
dwell
quite
as
much
on
the
soft
gentle
accents
of
the
petitioner
as
on
the
subject
of
her
petition
the
effect
on
pathfinder
was
striking
and
visible
visible
because
he
stood
erect
also
opposite
to
mabel
and
the
workings
of
his
countenance
as
usual
betrayed
the
workings
of
the
spirit
within
he
leaned
on
his
rifle
and
at
moments
the
sinewy
fingers
grasped
the
barrel
with
a
force
that
seemed
to
compress
the
weapon
while
once
or
twice
as
mabel
language
rose
in
intimate
association
with
her
thoughts
he
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
floor
above
him
as
if
he
expected
to
find
some
visible
evidence
of
the
presence
of
the
dread
being
to
whom
the
words
were
addressed
then
again
his
feelings
reverted
to
the
fair
creature
who
was
thus
pouring
out
her
spirit
in
fervent
but
calm
petitions
in
behalf
of
a
dying
parent
for
mabel
cheek
was
no
longer
pallid
but
was
flushed
with
a
holy
enthusiasm
while
her
blue
eyes
were
upturned
in
the
light
in
a
way
to
resemble
a
picture
by
guido
at
these
moments
all
the
honest
and
manly
attachment
of
pathfinder
glowed
in
his
ingenuous
features
and
his
gaze
at
our
heroine
was
such
as
the
fondest
parent
might
fasten
on
the
child
of
his
love
sergeant
dunham
laid
his
hand
feebly
on
the
head
of
mabel
as
she
ceased
praying
and
buried
her
face
in
his
blanket
bless
you
my
beloved
child
bless
you
he
rather
whispered
than
uttered
aloud
this
is
truly
consolation
would
that
i
too
could
pray
father
you
know
the
lord
prayer
you
taught
it
to
me
yourself
while
i
was
yet
an
the
sergeant
face
gleamed
with
a
smile
for
he
remember
to
have
discharged
that
portion
at
least
of
the
paternal
duty
and
the
consciousness
of
it
gave
him
inconceivable
gratification
at
that
solemn
moment
he
was
then
silent
for
several
minutes
and
all
present
believed
that
he
was
communing
with
god
mabel
my
child
he
at
length
uttered
in
a
voice
which
seemed
to
be
reviving
mabel
i
quitting
the
spirit
at
its
great
and
final
passage
appears
ever
to
consider
the
body
as
nothing
i
quitting
you
my
child
where
is
your
hand
here
dearest
father
here
are
both
oh
take
both
pathfinder
added
the
sergeant
feeling
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
where
jasper
still
knelt
and
getting
one
of
the
hands
of
the
young
man
by
mistake
take
it
i
leave
you
as
her
father
as
you
and
she
may
please
bless
you
bless
you
both
at
that
awful
instant
no
one
would
rudely
apprise
the
sergeant
of
his
mistake
and
he
died
a
minute
or
two
later
holding
jasper
and
hands
covered
by
both
his
own
our
heroine
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
until
an
exclamation
of
cap
announced
the
death
of
her
father
when
raising
her
face
she
saw
the
eyes
of
jasper
riveted
on
her
own
and
felt
the
warm
pressure
of
his
hand
but
a
single
feeling
was
predominant
at
that
instant
and
mabel
withdrew
to
weep
scarcely
conscious
of
what
had
occurred
the
pathfinder
took
the
arm
of
and
he
left
the
block
the
two
friends
walked
in
silence
past
the
fire
along
the
glade
and
nearly
reached
the
opposite
shore
of
the
island
in
profound
silence
here
they
stopped
and
pathfinder
spoke
is
all
over
jasper
said
he
is
all
over
ah
me
poor
sergeant
dunham
has
finished
his
march
and
that
too
by
the
hand
of
a
venomous
mingo
well
we
never
know
what
is
to
happen
and
his
luck
may
be
yourn
or
mine
or
next
day
and
mabel
what
is
to
become
of
mabel
pathfinder
you
heard
the
sergeant
dying
words
he
has
left
his
child
in
my
care
jasper
and
it
is
a
most
solemn
trust
it
is
yes
it
is
a
most
solemn
it
a
trust
pathfinder
of
which
any
man
would
be
glad
to
relieve
you
returned
the
youth
with
a
bitter
smile
i
often
thought
it
has
fallen
into
wrong
hands
i
not
consaited
jasper
i
not
consaited
i
do
think
i
not
but
if
mabel
dunham
is
willing
to
overlook
all
my
imperfections
and
ignorances
like
i
should
be
wrong
to
gainsay
it
on
account
of
any
sartainty
i
may
have
myself
about
my
own
want
of
no
one
will
blame
you
pathfinder
for
marrying
mabel
dunham
any
more
than
they
will
blame
you
for
wearing
a
precious
jewel
in
your
bosom
that
a
friend
had
freely
given
do
you
think
they
blame
mabel
lad
i
had
my
misgivings
about
that
too
for
all
persons
may
not
be
so
disposed
to
look
at
me
with
the
same
eyes
as
you
and
the
sergeant
jasper
started
as
a
man
flinches
at
sudden
bodily
pain
but
he
otherwise
maintained
his
and
mankind
is
envious
and
more
particularly
in
and
about
the
garrisons
i
sometimes
wish
jasper
that
mabel
could
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
i
do
and
that
you
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
for
it
often
seems
to
me
that
one
like
you
after
all
might
make
her
happier
than
i
ever
we
will
not
talk
about
this
pathfinder
interrupted
jasper
hoarsely
and
impatiently
you
will
be
mabel
husband
and
it
is
not
right
to
speak
of
any
one
else
in
that
character
as
for
me
i
shall
take
master
cap
advice
and
try
and
make
a
man
of
myself
by
seeing
what
is
to
be
done
on
the
salt
you
jasper
western
you
quit
the
lakes
the
forests
and
the
lines
and
this
too
for
the
towns
and
wasty
ways
of
the
settlements
and
a
little
difference
in
the
taste
of
the
water
have
we
the
if
salt
is
necessary
to
you
and
ought
man
to
be
satisfied
with
what
contents
the
other
creatur
of
god
i
counted
on
you
jasper
i
counted
on
you
i
did
and
thought
now
that
mabel
and
i
intend
to
dwell
in
a
cabin
of
our
own
that
some
day
you
might
be
tempted
to
choose
a
companion
too
and
come
and
settle
in
our
neighborhood
there
is
a
beautiful
spot
about
fifty
miles
west
of
the
garrison
that
i
had
chosen
in
my
mind
for
my
own
place
of
abode
and
there
is
an
excellent
harbor
about
ten
leagues
this
side
of
it
where
you
could
run
in
and
out
with
the
cutter
at
any
leisure
minute
and
i
even
fancied
you
and
your
wife
in
possession
of
the
one
place
and
mabel
and
i
in
possession
of
we
should
be
just
a
healthy
hunt
apart
and
if
the
lord
ever
intends
any
of
his
creaturs
to
be
happy
on
none
could
be
happier
than
we
you
forget
my
friend
answered
jasper
taking
the
guide
hand
and
forcing
a
friendly
smile
that
i
have
no
fourth
person
to
love
and
cherish
and
i
much
doubt
if
i
ever
shall
love
any
other
as
i
love
you
and
boy
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
but
what
you
call
love
for
mabel
is
only
friendship
like
and
a
very
different
thing
from
what
i
feel
now
instead
of
sleeping
as
sound
as
natur
at
midnight
as
i
used
to
could
i
dream
nightly
of
mabel
dunham
the
young
does
sport
before
me
and
when
i
raise
killdeer
in
order
to
take
a
little
venison
the
animals
look
back
and
it
seems
as
if
they
all
had
mabel
sweet
countenance
laughing
in
my
face
and
looking
as
if
they
said
me
if
you
dare
then
i
hear
her
soft
voice
calling
out
among
the
birds
as
they
sing
and
no
later
than
the
last
nap
i
took
i
bethought
me
in
fancy
of
going
over
the
niagara
holding
mabel
in
my
arms
rather
than
part
from
her
the
bitterest
moments
i
ever
known
were
them
in
which
the
devil
or
some
mingo
conjuror
perhaps
has
just
put
into
my
head
to
fancy
in
dreams
that
mabel
is
lost
to
me
by
some
unaccountable
calamity
either
by
changefulness
or
by
oh
pathfinder
if
you
think
this
so
bitter
in
a
dream
what
must
it
be
to
one
who
feels
its
reality
and
knows
it
all
to
be
true
true
true
so
true
as
to
leave
no
hope
to
leave
nothing
but
despair
these
words
burst
from
jasper
as
a
fluid
pours
from
the
vessel
that
has
been
suddenly
broken
they
were
uttered
involuntarily
almost
unconsciously
but
with
a
truth
and
feeling
that
carried
with
them
the
instant
conviction
of
their
deep
sincerity
pathfinder
started
gazed
at
his
friend
for
full
a
minute
like
one
bewildered
and
then
it
was
that
in
despite
of
all
his
simplicity
the
truth
gleamed
upon
him
all
know
how
corroborating
proofs
crowd
upon
the
mind
as
soon
as
it
catches
a
direct
clue
to
any
hitherto
unsuspected
fact
how
rapidly
the
thoughts
flow
and
premises
tend
to
their
just
conclusions
under
such
circumstances
our
hero
was
so
confiding
by
nature
so
just
and
so
much
disposed
to
imagine
that
all
his
friends
wished
him
the
same
happiness
as
he
wished
them
that
until
this
unfortunate
moment
a
suspicion
of
jasper
attachment
for
mabel
had
never
been
awakened
in
his
bosom
he
was
however
now
too
experienced
in
the
emotions
which
characterize
the
passion
and
the
burst
of
feeling
in
his
companion
was
too
violent
and
too
natural
to
leave
any
further
doubt
on
the
subject
the
feeling
that
first
followed
this
change
of
opinion
was
one
of
deep
humility
and
exquisite
pain
he
bethought
him
of
jasper
youth
his
higher
claims
to
personal
appearance
and
all
the
general
probabilities
that
such
a
suitor
would
be
more
agreeable
to
mabel
than
he
could
possibly
be
himself
then
the
noble
rectitude
of
mind
for
which
the
man
was
so
distinguished
asserted
its
power
it
was
sustained
by
his
rebuked
manner
of
thinking
of
himself
and
all
that
habitual
deference
for
the
rights
and
feelings
of
others
which
appeared
to
be
inbred
in
his
very
nature
taking
the
arm
of
jasper
he
led
him
to
a
log
where
he
compelled
the
young
man
to
seat
himself
by
a
sort
of
irresistible
exercise
of
his
iron
muscles
and
where
he
placed
himself
at
his
side
the
instant
his
feelings
had
found
vent
was
both
alarmed
at
and
ashamed
of
their
violence
he
would
have
given
all
he
possessed
on
earth
could
the
last
three
minutes
be
recalled
but
he
was
too
frank
by
disposition
and
too
much
accustomed
to
deal
ingenuously
by
his
friend
to
think
a
moment
of
attempting
further
concealment
or
of
any
evasion
of
the
explanation
that
he
knew
was
about
to
be
demanded
even
while
he
trembled
in
anticipation
of
what
was
about
to
follow
he
never
contemplated
equivocation
jasper
pathfinder
commenced
in
a
tone
so
solemn
as
to
thrill
on
every
nerve
in
his
listener
body
this
surprised
me
you
have
kinder
feelings
towards
mabel
than
i
had
thought
and
unless
my
own
mistaken
vanity
and
consait
have
cruelly
deceived
me
i
pity
you
boy
from
my
soul
i
do
yes
i
think
i
know
how
to
pity
any
one
who
has
set
his
heart
on
a
creature
like
mabel
unless
he
sees
a
prospect
of
her
regarding
him
as
he
regards
her
this
matter
must
be
cleared
up
as
the
delawares
say
until
there
shall
not
be
a
cloud
what
clearing
up
can
it
want
pathfinder
i
love
mabel
dunham
and
mabel
dunham
does
not
love
me
she
prefers
you
for
a
husband
and
the
wisest
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
off
at
once
to
the
salt
water
and
try
to
forget
you
forget
me
jasper
that
would
be
a
punishment
i
do
desarve
but
how
do
you
know
that
mabel
prefars
how
do
you
know
it
lad
to
me
it
seems
impossible
like
is
she
not
to
marry
you
and
would
mabel
marry
a
man
she
does
not
love
she
has
been
hard
urged
by
the
sergeant
she
has
and
a
dutiful
child
may
have
found
it
difficult
to
withstand
the
wishes
of
a
dying
parent
have
you
ever
told
mabel
that
you
prefarred
her
jasper
that
you
bore
her
these
feelings
never
pathfinder
i
would
not
do
you
that
i
believe
you
lad
i
do
believe
you
and
i
think
you
would
now
go
off
to
the
salt
water
and
let
the
scent
die
with
you
but
this
must
not
be
mabel
shall
hear
all
and
she
shall
have
her
own
way
if
my
heart
breaks
in
the
trial
she
shall
no
words
have
ever
passed
you
then
jasper
nothing
of
account
nothing
direct
still
i
will
own
all
my
foolishness
pathfinder
for
i
ought
to
own
it
to
a
generous
friend
like
you
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
you
know
how
young
people
understand
each
other
or
think
they
understand
each
other
without
always
speaking
out
in
plain
speech
and
get
to
know
each
thoughts
or
to
think
they
know
them
by
means
of
a
hundred
little
not
i
jasper
not
i
truly
answered
the
guide
for
sooth
to
say
his
advances
had
never
been
met
with
any
of
that
sweet
and
precious
encouragement
which
silently
marks
the
course
of
sympathy
united
to
passion
not
i
jasper
i
know
nothing
of
all
this
mabel
has
always
treated
me
fairly
and
said
what
she
has
had
to
say
in
speech
as
plain
as
tongue
could
tell
you
have
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
her
say
that
she
loved
you
pathfinder
why
no
jasper
not
just
that
in
words
she
has
told
me
that
we
never
could
never
ought
to
be
married
that
was
not
good
enough
for
though
she
say
that
she
honored
me
and
respected
me
but
then
the
sergeant
said
it
was
always
so
with
the
youthful
and
timid
that
her
mother
did
so
and
said
so
afore
her
and
that
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
if
she
would
consent
on
any
terms
to
marry
me
and
therefore
i
have
concluded
that
all
was
right
i
in
spite
of
all
his
friendship
for
the
successful
wooer
in
spite
of
all
his
honest
sincere
wished
for
his
happiness
we
should
be
unfaithful
chroniclers
did
we
not
own
that
jasper
felt
his
heart
bound
with
an
uncontrollable
feeling
of
delight
at
this
admission
it
was
not
that
he
saw
or
felt
any
hope
connected
with
the
circumstance
but
it
was
grateful
to
the
jealous
covetousness
of
unlimited
love
thus
to
learn
that
no
other
ears
had
heard
the
sweet
confessions
that
were
denied
its
own
tell
me
more
of
this
manner
of
talking
without
the
use
of
the
tongue
continued
pathfinder
whose
countenance
was
becoming
grave
and
who
now
questioned
his
companion
like
one
who
seemed
to
anticipate
evil
in
the
reply
i
can
and
have
conversed
with
chingachgook
and
with
his
son
uncas
too
in
that
mode
afore
the
latter
fell
but
i
did
know
that
young
girls
practysed
this
art
and
least
of
all
mabel
is
nothing
pathfinder
i
mean
only
a
look
or
a
smile
or
a
glance
of
the
eye
or
the
trembling
of
an
arm
or
a
hand
when
the
young
woman
has
had
occasion
to
touch
me
and
because
i
have
been
weak
enough
to
tremble
even
at
mabel
breath
or
her
brushing
me
with
her
clothes
my
vain
thoughts
have
misled
me
i
never
spoke
plainly
to
mabel
myself
and
now
there
is
no
use
for
it
since
there
is
clearly
no
jasper
returned
pathfinder
simply
but
with
a
dignity
that
precluded
further
remarks
at
the
moment
we
will
talk
of
the
sergeant
funeral
and
of
our
own
departure
from
this
island
after
these
things
are
disposed
of
it
will
be
time
enough
to
say
more
of
the
daughter
this
matter
must
be
looked
into
for
the
father
left
me
the
care
of
his
jasper
was
glad
enough
to
change
the
subject
and
the
friends
separated
each
charged
with
the
duty
most
peculiar
to
his
own
station
and
habits
that
afternoon
all
the
dead
were
interred
the
grave
of
sergeant
dunham
being
dug
in
the
centre
of
the
glade
beneath
the
shade
of
a
huge
elm
mabel
wept
bitterly
at
the
ceremony
and
she
found
relief
in
thus
disburthening
her
sorrow
the
night
passed
tranquilly
as
did
the
whole
of
the
following
day
jasper
declaring
that
the
gale
was
too
severe
to
venture
on
the
lake
this
circumstance
detained
captain
sanglier
also
who
did
not
quit
the
island
until
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
the
death
of
dunham
when
the
weather
had
moderated
and
the
wind
had
become
fair
then
indeed
he
departed
after
taking
leave
of
the
pathfinder
in
the
manner
of
one
who
believed
he
was
in
company
of
a
distinguished
character
for
the
last
time
the
two
separated
like
those
who
respect
one
another
while
each
felt
that
the
other
was
all
enigma
to
himself
chapter
xxix
playful
she
turn
that
he
might
see
the
passing
smile
her
cheek
put
on
but
when
she
marked
how
mournfully
his
eyes
met
hers
that
smile
was
gone
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
days
had
been
too
exciting
and
had
made
too
many
demands
on
the
fortitude
of
our
heroine
to
leave
her
in
the
helplessness
of
grief
she
mourned
for
her
father
and
she
occasionally
shuddered
as
she
recalled
the
sudden
death
of
jennie
and
all
the
horrible
scenes
she
had
witnessed
but
on
the
whole
she
had
aroused
herself
and
was
no
longer
in
the
deep
depression
which
usually
accompanies
grief
perhaps
the
overwhelming
almost
stupefying
sorrow
that
crushed
poor
june
and
left
her
for
nearly
hours
in
a
state
of
stupor
assisted
mabel
in
conquering
her
own
feelings
for
she
had
felt
called
on
to
administer
consolation
to
the
young
indian
woman
this
she
had
done
in
the
quiet
soothing
insinuating
way
in
which
her
sex
usually
exerts
its
influence
on
such
occasions
the
morning
of
the
third
day
was
set
for
that
on
which
the
was
to
sail
jasper
had
made
all
his
preparations
the
different
effects
were
embarked
and
mabel
had
taken
leave
of
june
a
painful
and
affectionate
parting
in
a
word
all
was
ready
and
every
soul
had
left
the
island
but
the
indian
woman
pathfinder
jasper
and
our
heroine
the
former
had
gone
into
a
thicket
to
weep
and
the
three
last
were
approaching
the
spot
where
three
canoes
lay
one
of
which
was
the
property
of
june
and
the
other
two
were
in
waiting
to
carry
the
others
off
to
the
pathfinder
led
the
way
but
when
he
drew
near
the
shore
instead
of
taking
the
direction
to
the
boats
he
motioned
to
his
companions
to
follow
and
proceeded
to
a
fallen
tree
which
lay
on
the
margin
of
the
glade
and
out
of
view
of
those
in
the
cutter
seating
himself
on
the
trunk
he
signed
to
mabel
to
take
her
place
on
one
side
of
him
and
to
jasper
to
occupy
the
other
sit
down
here
mabel
sit
down
there
he
commenced
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
own
seat
i
something
that
lies
heavy
on
my
mind
and
now
is
the
time
to
take
it
off
if
it
ever
to
be
done
sit
down
mabel
and
let
me
lighten
my
heart
if
not
my
conscience
while
i
the
strength
to
do
the
pause
that
succeeded
lasted
two
or
three
minutes
and
both
the
young
people
wondered
what
was
to
come
next
the
idea
that
pathfinder
could
have
any
weight
on
his
conscience
seeming
equally
improbable
to
each
mabel
our
hero
at
length
resumed
we
must
talk
plainly
to
each
other
afore
we
join
your
uncle
in
the
cutter
where
the
saltwater
has
slept
every
night
since
the
last
rally
for
he
says
it
the
only
place
in
which
a
man
can
be
sure
of
keeping
the
hair
on
his
head
he
does
me
what
have
i
to
do
with
these
follies
and
sayings
now
i
try
to
be
pleasant
and
to
feel
but
the
power
of
man
ca
make
water
run
up
stream
mabel
you
know
that
the
sergeant
afore
he
left
us
had
settled
it
us
two
that
we
were
to
become
man
and
wife
and
that
we
were
to
live
together
and
to
love
one
another
as
long
as
the
lord
was
pleased
to
keep
us
both
on
yes
and
afterwards
too
mabel
cheeks
had
regained
a
little
of
their
ancient
bloom
in
the
fresh
air
of
the
morning
but
at
this
address
they
blanched
again
nearly
to
the
pallid
hue
which
grief
had
imprinted
there
still
she
looked
kindly
though
seriously
at
pathfinder
and
even
endeavored
to
force
a
smile
very
true
my
excellent
friend
she
answered
this
was
my
poor
father
wish
and
i
feel
certain
that
a
whole
life
devoted
to
your
welfare
and
comforts
could
scarcely
repay
you
for
all
you
have
done
for
i
fear
me
mabel
that
man
and
wife
needs
be
bound
together
by
a
stronger
tie
than
such
feelings
i
do
you
have
done
nothing
for
me
or
nothing
of
any
account
and
yet
my
very
heart
yearns
towards
you
it
does
and
therefore
it
seems
likely
that
these
feelings
come
from
something
besides
saving
scalps
and
guiding
through
mabel
cheek
had
begun
to
glow
again
and
though
she
struggled
hard
to
smile
her
voice
trembled
a
little
as
she
answered
had
we
not
better
postpone
this
conversation
pathfinder
she
said
we
are
not
alone
and
nothing
is
so
unpleasant
to
a
listener
they
say
as
family
matters
in
which
he
feels
no
it
because
we
are
not
alone
mabel
or
rather
because
jasper
is
with
us
that
i
wish
to
talk
of
this
matter
the
sergeant
believed
i
might
make
a
suitable
companion
for
you
and
though
i
had
misgivings
about
it
yes
i
had
many
misgivings
he
finally
persuaded
me
into
the
idee
and
things
came
round
us
as
you
know
but
when
you
promised
your
father
to
marry
me
mabel
and
gave
me
your
hand
so
modestly
but
so
prettily
there
was
one
circumstance
as
your
uncle
called
it
that
you
did
know
and
i
thought
it
right
to
tell
you
what
it
is
before
matters
are
finally
settled
i
often
taken
a
poor
deer
for
my
dinner
when
good
venison
was
not
to
be
found
but
it
as
not
to
take
up
with
the
worst
when
the
best
may
be
you
speak
in
a
way
pathfinder
that
is
difficult
to
be
understood
if
this
conversation
is
really
necessary
i
trust
you
will
be
more
well
then
mabel
i
been
thinking
it
was
quite
likely
when
you
gave
in
to
the
sergeant
wishes
that
you
did
not
know
the
natur
of
jasper
western
feelings
towards
you
pathfinder
and
mabel
cheek
now
paled
to
the
livid
hue
of
death
then
it
flushed
to
the
tint
of
crimson
and
her
whole
frame
shuddered
pathfinder
however
was
too
intent
on
his
own
object
to
notice
this
agitation
and
had
hidden
his
face
in
his
hands
in
time
to
shut
out
its
view
i
been
talking
with
the
lad
and
on
comparing
his
dreams
with
my
dreams
his
feelings
with
my
feelings
and
his
wishes
with
my
wishes
i
fear
we
think
too
much
alike
consarning
you
for
both
of
us
to
be
very
pathfinder
you
forget
you
should
remember
that
we
are
betrothed
said
mabel
hastily
and
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
required
acute
attention
in
the
listeners
to
catch
the
syllables
indeed
the
last
word
was
not
quite
intelligible
to
the
guide
and
he
confessed
his
ignorance
by
the
usual
anan
you
forget
that
we
are
to
be
married
and
such
allusions
are
improper
as
well
as
everything
is
proper
that
is
right
mabel
and
everything
is
right
that
leads
to
justice
and
fair
dealing
though
it
enough
as
you
say
as
i
find
on
trial
i
do
now
mabel
had
you
known
that
thinks
of
you
in
this
way
maybe
you
never
would
have
consented
to
be
married
to
one
as
old
and
as
uncomely
as
i
why
this
cruel
trial
pathfinder
to
what
can
all
this
lead
jasper
western
thinks
no
such
thing
he
says
nothing
he
feels
mabel
burst
from
out
of
the
young
man
lips
in
a
way
to
betray
the
uncontrollable
nature
of
his
emotions
though
he
uttered
not
another
syllable
mabel
buried
her
face
in
both
her
hands
and
the
two
sat
like
a
pair
of
guilty
beings
suddenly
detected
in
the
commission
of
some
crime
which
involved
the
happiness
of
a
common
patron
at
that
instant
perhaps
jasper
himself
was
inclined
to
deny
his
passion
through
an
extreme
unwillingness
to
grieve
his
friend
while
mabel
on
whom
this
positive
announcement
of
a
fact
that
she
had
rather
unconsciously
hoped
than
believed
came
so
unexpectedly
felt
her
mind
momentarily
bewildered
and
she
scarcely
knew
whether
to
weep
or
to
rejoice
still
she
was
the
first
to
speak
since
could
utter
naught
that
would
be
disingenuous
or
that
would
pain
his
friend
pathfinder
said
she
you
talk
wildly
why
mention
this
at
all
well
mabel
if
i
talk
wildly
i
half
wild
you
know
by
natur
i
fear
as
well
as
by
as
he
said
this
he
endeavored
to
laugh
in
his
usual
noiseless
way
but
the
effect
produced
a
strange
and
discordant
sound
and
it
appeared
nearly
to
choke
him
yes
i
be
wild
i
not
attempt
to
deny
dearest
pathfinder
my
best
almost
my
only
friend
you
do
think
i
intended
to
say
that
interrupted
mabel
almost
breathless
in
her
haste
to
relieve
his
mortification
if
courage
truth
nobleness
of
soul
and
conduct
unyielding
principles
and
a
hundred
other
excellent
qualities
can
render
any
man
respectable
esteemed
or
beloved
your
claims
are
inferior
to
those
of
no
other
human
what
tender
and
bewitching
voices
they
have
jasper
resumed
the
guide
now
laughing
freely
and
naturally
yes
natur
seems
to
have
made
them
on
purpose
to
sing
in
our
ears
when
the
music
of
the
woods
is
silent
but
we
must
come
to
a
right
understanding
we
must
i
ask
you
again
mabel
if
you
had
known
that
jasper
western
loves
you
as
well
as
i
do
or
better
perhaps
though
that
is
scarcely
possible
that
in
his
dreams
he
sees
your
face
in
the
water
of
the
lake
that
he
talks
to
you
and
of
you
in
his
sleep
fancies
all
that
is
beautiful
like
mabel
dunham
and
all
that
is
good
and
virtuous
believes
he
never
knowed
happiness
until
he
knowed
you
could
kiss
the
ground
on
which
you
have
trod
and
forgets
all
the
joys
of
his
calling
to
think
of
you
and
the
delight
of
gazing
at
your
beauty
and
in
listening
to
your
voice
would
you
then
have
consented
to
marry
me
mabel
could
not
have
answered
this
question
if
she
would
but
though
her
face
was
buried
in
her
hands
the
tint
of
the
rushing
blood
was
visible
between
the
openings
and
the
suffusion
seemed
to
impart
itself
to
her
very
fingers
still
nature
asserted
her
power
for
there
was
a
single
instant
when
the
astonished
almost
terrified
girl
stole
a
glance
at
jasper
as
if
distrusting
pathfinder
history
of
his
feelings
read
the
truth
of
all
he
said
in
that
furtive
look
and
instantly
concealed
her
face
again
as
if
she
would
hide
it
from
observation
for
ever
take
time
to
think
mabel
the
guide
continued
for
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
accept
one
man
for
a
husband
while
the
thoughts
and
wishes
lead
to
another
jasper
and
i
have
talked
this
matter
over
freely
and
like
old
friends
and
though
i
always
knowed
that
we
viewed
most
things
pretty
much
alike
i
could
have
thought
that
we
regarded
any
particular
object
with
the
very
same
eyes
as
it
might
be
until
we
opened
our
minds
to
each
other
about
you
now
jasper
owns
that
the
very
first
time
he
beheld
you
he
thought
you
the
sweetest
and
winningestest
creatur
he
had
ever
met
that
your
voice
sounded
like
murmuring
water
in
his
ears
that
he
fancied
his
sails
were
your
garments
fluttering
in
the
wind
that
your
laugh
haunted
him
in
his
sleep
and
that
and
has
he
started
up
affrighted
because
he
has
fancied
some
one
wanted
to
force
you
out
of
the
where
he
imagined
you
had
taken
up
your
abode
nay
the
lad
has
even
acknowledged
that
he
often
weeps
at
the
thought
that
you
are
likely
to
spend
your
days
with
another
and
not
with
jasper
it
solemn
truth
mabel
and
it
right
you
should
know
it
now
stand
up
and
choose
us
i
do
believe
loves
you
as
well
as
i
do
myself
he
has
tried
to
persuade
me
that
he
loves
you
better
but
that
i
will
not
allow
for
i
do
not
think
it
possible
but
i
will
own
the
boy
loves
you
heart
and
soul
and
he
has
a
good
right
to
be
heard
the
sergeant
left
me
your
protector
and
not
your
tyrant
i
told
him
that
i
would
be
a
father
to
you
as
well
as
a
husband
and
it
seems
to
me
no
feeling
father
would
deny
his
child
this
small
privilege
stand
up
mabel
therefore
and
speak
your
thoughts
as
freely
as
if
i
were
the
sergeant
himself
seeking
your
good
and
nothing
mabel
dropped
her
hands
arose
and
stood
face
to
face
with
her
two
suitors
though
the
flush
that
was
on
her
cheeks
was
feverish
the
evidence
of
excitement
rather
than
of
shame
what
would
you
have
pathfinder
she
asked
have
i
not
already
promised
my
poor
father
to
do
all
you
desire
then
i
desire
this
here
i
stand
a
man
of
the
forest
and
of
little
larning
though
i
fear
with
an
ambition
beyond
my
desarts
and
do
my
endivors
to
do
justice
to
both
sides
in
the
first
place
it
is
allowed
that
so
far
as
feelings
in
your
behalf
are
consarned
we
love
you
just
the
same
jasper
thinks
his
feelings
be
the
strongest
but
this
i
can
not
say
in
honesty
for
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
be
true
else
i
would
frankly
and
freely
confess
it
i
would
so
in
this
particular
mabel
we
are
here
before
you
on
equal
tarms
as
for
myself
being
the
oldest
i
first
say
what
little
can
be
produced
in
my
favor
as
well
as
it
as
a
hunter
i
do
think
there
is
no
man
near
the
lines
that
can
outdo
me
if
venison
or
bear
meat
or
even
birds
and
fish
should
ever
be
scarce
in
our
cabin
it
would
be
more
likely
to
be
owing
to
natur
and
providence
than
to
any
fault
of
mine
in
short
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
woman
who
depended
on
me
would
never
be
likely
to
want
for
food
but
i
fearful
ignorant
it
true
i
speak
several
tongues
such
as
they
be
while
i
very
far
from
being
expart
at
my
own
then
my
years
are
greater
than
your
own
mabel
and
the
circumstance
that
i
was
so
long
the
sergeant
comrade
can
be
no
great
merit
in
your
eyes
i
wish
too
i
was
more
comely
i
do
but
we
are
all
as
natur
made
us
and
the
last
thing
that
a
man
ought
to
lament
except
on
very
special
occasions
is
his
looks
when
all
is
remembered
age
looks
learning
and
habits
mabel
conscience
tells
me
i
ought
to
confess
that
i
altogether
unfit
for
you
if
not
downright
unworthy
and
i
would
give
up
the
hope
this
minute
i
would
if
i
feel
something
pulling
at
my
which
seems
hard
to
pathfinder
noble
generous
pathfinder
cried
our
heroine
seizing
his
hand
and
kissing
it
with
a
species
of
holy
reverence
you
do
yourself
injustice
you
forget
my
poor
father
and
your
promise
you
do
not
know
now
here
jasper
continued
the
guide
without
allowing
the
caresses
to
win
him
from
his
purpose
with
the
case
is
different
in
the
way
of
providing
as
in
that
of
loving
there
not
much
to
choose
us
for
the
lad
is
frugal
industrious
and
careful
then
he
is
quite
a
scholar
knows
the
tongue
of
the
frenchers
reads
many
books
and
some
i
know
that
you
like
to
read
yourself
can
understand
you
at
all
times
which
perhaps
is
more
than
i
can
say
for
what
of
all
this
interrupted
mabel
impatiently
why
speak
of
it
now
why
speak
of
it
at
all
then
the
lad
has
a
manner
of
letting
his
thoughts
be
known
that
i
fear
i
can
never
equal
if
there
anything
on
that
would
make
my
tongue
bold
and
persuading
mabel
i
do
think
it
yourself
and
yet
in
our
late
conversations
jasper
has
outdone
me
even
on
this
point
in
a
way
to
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
he
has
told
me
how
simple
you
were
and
how
and
and
how
you
looked
down
upon
vanities
for
though
you
might
be
the
wife
of
more
than
one
officer
as
he
thinks
that
you
cling
to
feeling
and
would
rather
be
true
to
yourself
and
natur
than
a
colonel
lady
he
fairly
made
my
blood
warm
he
did
when
he
spoke
of
your
having
beauty
without
seeming
ever
to
have
looked
upon
it
and
the
manner
in
which
you
moved
about
like
a
young
so
and
graceful
like
without
knowing
it
and
the
truth
and
justice
of
your
idees
and
the
warmth
and
generosity
of
your
heart
jasper
interrupted
mabel
giving
way
to
feelings
that
had
gathered
an
ungovernable
force
by
being
so
long
pent
and
falling
into
the
young
man
willing
arms
weeping
like
a
child
and
almost
as
helpless
jasper
jasper
why
have
you
kept
this
from
me
the
answer
of
was
not
very
intelligible
nor
was
the
murmured
dialogue
that
followed
remarkable
for
coherency
but
the
language
of
affection
is
easily
understood
the
hour
that
succeeded
passed
like
a
very
few
minutes
of
ordinary
life
so
far
as
a
computation
of
time
was
concerned
and
when
mabel
recollected
herself
and
bethought
her
of
the
existence
of
others
her
uncle
was
pacing
the
cutter
deck
in
great
impatience
and
wondering
why
jasper
should
be
losing
so
much
of
a
favorable
wind
her
first
thought
was
of
him
who
was
so
likely
to
feel
the
recent
betrayal
of
her
real
emotions
oh
jasper
she
exclaimed
like
one
suddenly
the
pathfinder
fairly
trembled
not
with
unmanly
apprehension
but
with
the
painful
conviction
of
the
pang
he
had
given
his
friend
and
he
looked
in
all
directions
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
his
person
but
pathfinder
had
withdrawn
with
a
tact
and
a
delicacy
that
might
have
done
credit
to
the
sensibility
and
breeding
of
a
courtier
for
several
minutes
the
two
lovers
sat
silently
waiting
his
return
uncertain
what
propriety
required
of
them
under
circumstances
so
marked
and
so
peculiar
at
length
they
beheld
their
friend
advancing
slowly
towards
them
with
a
thoughtful
and
even
pensive
air
i
now
understand
what
you
meant
jasper
by
speaking
without
a
tongue
and
hearing
without
an
ear
he
said
when
close
enough
to
the
tree
to
be
heard
yes
i
understand
it
now
i
do
and
a
very
pleasant
sort
of
discourse
it
is
when
one
can
hold
it
with
mabel
dunham
ah
me
i
told
the
sergeant
i
was
fit
for
her
that
i
was
too
old
too
ignorant
and
too
wild
like
but
he
have
it
jasper
and
mabel
sat
resembling
milton
picture
of
our
first
parents
when
the
consciousness
of
sin
first
laid
its
leaden
weight
on
their
souls
neither
spoke
neither
even
moved
though
both
at
that
moment
fancied
they
could
part
with
their
happiness
in
order
to
restore
their
friend
to
his
peace
of
mind
jasper
was
pale
as
death
but
in
mabel
maiden
modesty
had
caused
the
blood
to
mantle
on
her
cheeks
until
their
bloom
was
heightened
to
a
richness
that
was
scarcely
equalled
in
her
hours
of
buoyancy
and
joy
as
the
feeling
which
in
her
sex
always
accompanies
the
security
of
love
returned
threw
its
softness
and
tenderness
over
her
countenance
she
was
singularly
beautiful
pathfinder
gazed
at
her
with
an
intentness
he
did
not
endeavor
to
conceal
and
then
he
fairly
laughed
in
his
own
way
and
with
a
sort
of
wild
exultation
as
men
that
are
untutored
are
wont
to
express
their
delight
this
momentary
indulgence
however
was
expiated
by
the
pang
which
followed
the
sudden
consciousness
that
this
glorious
young
creature
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
it
required
a
full
minute
for
this
being
to
recover
from
the
shock
of
this
conviction
and
then
he
recovered
his
dignity
of
manner
speaking
with
gravity
almost
with
solemnity
i
have
always
known
mabel
dunham
that
men
have
their
gifts
said
he
but
i
forgotten
that
it
did
not
belong
to
mine
to
please
the
young
the
beautiful
and
i
hope
the
mistake
has
been
no
very
heavy
sin
and
if
it
was
i
been
heavily
punished
for
it
i
have
nay
mabel
i
know
what
you
say
but
it
unnecessary
i
it
all
and
that
is
as
good
as
if
i
it
all
i
had
a
bitter
hour
mabel
i
had
a
very
bitter
hour
hour
echoed
mabel
as
the
other
first
used
the
word
the
blood
which
had
begun
to
ebb
towards
her
heart
rushing
again
tumultuously
to
her
very
temples
surely
not
an
hour
pathfinder
hour
exclaimed
jasper
at
the
same
instant
no
no
my
worthy
friend
it
is
not
ten
minutes
since
you
left
us
well
it
may
be
so
though
to
me
it
has
seemed
to
be
a
day
i
begin
to
think
however
that
the
happy
count
time
by
minutes
and
the
miserable
count
it
by
months
but
we
will
talk
no
more
of
this
it
is
all
over
now
and
many
words
about
it
will
make
you
no
happier
while
they
will
only
tell
me
what
i
lost
and
quite
likely
how
much
i
desarved
to
lose
her
no
no
mabel
is
useless
to
interrupt
me
i
admit
it
all
and
your
gainsaying
it
though
it
be
so
well
meant
can
not
change
my
mind
well
jasper
she
is
yours
and
though
it
hard
to
think
it
i
do
believe
you
make
her
happier
than
i
could
for
your
gifts
are
better
suited
to
do
so
though
i
would
have
strived
hard
to
do
as
much
if
i
know
myself
i
would
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
believe
the
sergeant
and
i
ought
to
have
put
faith
in
what
mabel
told
me
at
the
head
of
the
lake
for
reason
and
judgment
might
have
shown
me
its
truth
but
it
is
so
pleasant
to
think
what
we
wish
and
mankind
so
easily
us
when
we
ourselves
but
what
the
use
in
talking
of
it
as
i
said
afore
it
true
mabel
seemed
to
be
consenting
though
it
all
came
from
a
wish
to
please
her
father
and
from
being
skeary
about
the
savages
pathfinder
i
understand
you
mabel
and
have
no
hard
feelings
i
have
i
sometimes
think
i
should
like
to
live
in
your
neighborhood
that
i
might
look
at
your
happiness
but
on
the
whole
it
better
i
should
quit
the
altogether
and
go
back
to
the
which
is
my
natyve
rigiment
as
it
might
be
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
had
i
never
left
it
though
my
sarvices
were
much
wanted
in
this
quarter
and
i
been
with
some
of
the
years
agone
sergeant
dunham
for
instance
when
he
was
in
another
corps
still
jasper
i
do
not
regret
that
i
known
you
and
me
pathfinder
impetuously
interrupted
mabel
do
you
regret
having
known
could
i
think
so
i
should
never
be
at
peace
with
you
mabel
returned
the
guide
taking
the
hand
of
our
heroine
and
looking
up
into
her
countenance
with
guileless
simplicity
but
earnest
affection
how
could
i
be
sorry
that
a
ray
of
the
sun
came
across
the
gloom
of
a
cheerless
day
that
light
has
broken
in
upon
darkness
though
it
remained
so
short
a
time
i
do
not
flatter
myself
with
being
able
to
march
quite
so
as
i
once
used
to
could
or
to
sleep
as
sound
for
some
time
to
come
but
i
shall
always
remember
how
near
i
was
to
being
undeservedly
happy
i
shall
so
far
from
blaming
you
mabel
i
only
blame
myself
for
being
so
vain
as
to
think
it
possible
i
could
please
such
a
creatur
for
sartainly
you
told
me
how
it
was
when
we
talked
it
over
on
the
mountain
and
i
ought
to
have
believed
you
then
for
i
do
suppose
it
that
young
women
should
know
their
own
minds
better
than
their
fathers
ah
me
it
settled
now
and
nothing
remains
but
for
me
to
take
leave
of
you
that
you
may
depart
i
feel
that
master
cap
must
be
impatient
and
there
is
danger
of
his
coming
on
shore
to
look
for
us
to
take
leave
exclaimed
mabel
leave
echoed
jasper
you
do
not
mean
to
quit
us
my
friend
is
best
mabel
is
altogether
best
and
it
wisest
i
could
live
and
die
in
your
company
if
i
only
followed
feeling
but
if
i
follow
reason
i
shall
quit
you
here
you
will
go
back
to
oswego
and
become
man
and
wife
as
soon
as
you
arrive
for
all
that
is
determined
with
master
cap
who
hankers
after
the
sea
again
and
who
knows
what
is
to
happen
while
i
shall
return
to
the
wilderness
and
my
maker
come
mabel
continued
pathfinder
rising
and
drawing
nearer
to
our
heroine
with
grave
decorum
kiss
me
jasper
will
not
grudge
me
one
kiss
then
we
oh
pathfinder
exclaimed
mabel
falling
into
the
arms
of
the
guide
and
kissing
his
cheeks
again
and
again
with
a
freedom
and
warmth
she
had
been
far
from
manifesting
while
held
to
the
bosom
of
jasper
god
bless
you
dearest
pathfinder
you
come
to
us
hereafter
we
shall
see
you
again
when
old
you
will
come
to
our
dwelling
and
let
me
be
a
daughter
to
you
yes
that
it
returned
the
guide
almost
gasping
for
breath
try
to
think
of
it
in
that
way
you
more
befitting
to
be
my
daughter
than
to
be
my
wife
you
are
farewell
jasper
now
we
go
to
the
canoe
it
time
you
were
on
the
manner
in
which
pathfinder
led
the
way
to
the
shore
was
solemn
and
calm
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
canoe
he
again
took
mabel
by
the
hands
held
her
at
the
length
of
his
own
arms
and
gazed
wistfully
into
her
face
until
the
unbidden
tears
rolled
out
of
the
fountains
of
feeling
and
trickled
down
his
rugged
cheeks
in
streams
bless
me
pathfinder
said
mabel
kneeling
reverently
at
his
feet
oh
at
least
bless
me
before
we
part
that
untutored
but
being
did
as
she
desired
and
aiding
her
to
enter
the
canoe
seemed
to
tear
himself
away
as
one
snaps
a
strong
and
obstinate
cord
before
he
retired
however
he
took
jasper
by
the
arm
and
led
him
a
little
aside
when
he
spoke
as
follows
you
kind
of
heart
and
gentle
by
natur
jasper
but
we
are
both
rough
and
wild
in
comparison
with
that
dear
creatur
be
careful
of
her
and
never
show
the
roughness
of
man
natur
to
her
soft
disposition
you
get
to
understand
her
in
time
and
the
lord
who
governs
the
lake
and
the
forest
alike
who
looks
upon
virtue
with
a
smile
and
upon
vice
with
a
frown
keep
you
happy
and
worthy
to
be
so
pathfinder
made
a
sign
for
his
friend
to
depart
and
he
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
until
the
canoe
had
reached
the
side
of
the
mabel
wept
as
if
her
heart
would
break
nor
did
her
eyes
once
turn
from
the
open
spot
in
the
glade
where
the
form
of
the
pathfinder
was
to
be
seen
until
the
cutter
had
passed
a
point
that
completely
shut
out
the
island
when
last
in
view
the
sinewy
frame
of
this
extraordinary
man
was
as
motionless
as
if
it
were
a
statue
set
up
in
that
solitary
place
to
commemorate
the
scenes
of
which
it
had
so
lately
been
the
witness
chapter
xxx
oh
let
me
only
breathe
the
air
the
blessed
air
that
breath
by
thee
and
whether
on
its
wings
it
bear
healing
or
death
is
sweet
to
me
moore
pathfinder
was
accustomed
to
solitude
but
when
the
had
actually
disappeared
he
was
almost
overcome
with
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
never
before
had
he
been
conscious
of
his
isolated
condition
in
the
world
for
his
feelings
had
gradually
been
accustoming
themselves
to
the
blandishments
and
wants
of
social
life
particularly
as
the
last
were
connected
with
the
domestic
affections
now
all
had
vanished
as
it
might
be
in
one
moment
and
he
was
left
equally
without
companions
and
without
hope
even
chingachgook
had
left
him
though
it
was
but
temporarily
still
his
presence
was
missed
at
the
precise
instant
which
might
be
termed
the
most
critical
in
our
hero
life
pathfinder
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
in
the
attitude
described
in
the
last
chapter
a
long
time
after
the
had
disappeared
the
rigidity
of
his
limbs
seemed
permanent
and
none
but
a
man
accustomed
to
put
his
muscles
to
the
severest
proof
could
have
maintained
that
posture
with
its
inflexibility
for
so
great
a
length
of
time
at
length
he
moved
away
from
the
spot
the
motion
of
the
body
being
preceded
by
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
heave
up
from
the
very
depths
of
his
bosom
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
this
extraordinary
being
that
his
senses
and
his
limbs
for
all
practical
purposes
were
never
at
fault
let
the
mind
be
preoccupied
with
other
interests
as
much
as
it
might
on
the
present
occasion
neither
of
these
great
auxiliaries
failed
him
but
though
his
thoughts
were
exclusively
occupied
with
mabel
her
beauty
her
preference
of
jasper
her
tears
and
her
departure
he
moved
in
a
direct
line
to
the
spot
where
june
still
remained
which
was
the
grave
of
her
husband
the
conversation
that
followed
passed
in
the
language
of
the
tuscaroras
which
pathfinder
spoke
fluently
but
as
that
tongue
is
understood
only
by
the
extremely
learned
we
shall
translate
it
freely
into
the
english
preserving
as
far
as
possible
the
tone
of
thought
of
each
interlocutor
as
well
as
the
peculiarities
of
manner
june
had
suffered
her
hair
to
fall
about
her
face
had
taken
a
seat
on
a
stone
which
had
been
dug
from
the
excavation
made
by
the
grave
and
was
hanging
over
the
spot
which
contained
the
body
of
arrowhead
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
any
other
she
believed
indeed
that
all
had
left
the
island
but
herself
and
the
tread
of
the
guide
moccasined
foot
was
too
noiseless
rudely
to
undeceive
her
pathfinder
stood
gazing
at
the
woman
for
several
minutes
in
mute
attention
the
contemplation
of
her
grief
the
recollection
of
her
irreparable
loss
and
the
view
of
her
desolation
produced
a
healthful
influence
on
his
own
feelings
his
reason
telling
him
how
much
deeper
lay
the
sources
of
grief
in
a
young
wife
who
was
suddenly
and
violently
deprived
of
her
husband
than
in
himself
he
said
solemnly
but
with
an
earnestness
which
denoted
the
strength
of
his
sympathy
you
are
not
alone
in
your
sorrow
turn
and
let
your
eyes
look
upon
a
june
has
no
longer
any
friend
the
woman
answered
arrowhead
has
gone
to
the
happy
and
there
is
no
one
left
to
care
for
june
the
tuscaroras
would
chase
her
from
their
wigwams
the
iroquois
are
hateful
in
her
eyes
and
she
could
not
look
at
them
no
leave
june
to
starve
over
the
grave
of
her
this
will
never
do
this
will
never
do
is
reason
and
right
you
believe
in
the
manitou
june
he
has
hid
his
face
from
june
because
he
is
angry
he
has
left
her
alone
to
listen
to
one
who
has
had
a
long
acquaintance
with
red
natur
though
he
has
a
white
birth
and
white
gifts
when
the
manitou
of
a
wishes
to
produce
good
in
a
heart
he
strikes
it
with
grief
for
it
is
in
our
sorrows
june
that
we
look
with
the
truest
eyes
into
ourselves
and
with
the
eyes
too
as
respects
right
the
great
spirit
wishes
you
well
and
he
has
taken
away
the
chief
lest
you
should
be
led
astray
by
his
wily
tongue
and
get
to
be
a
mingo
in
your
disposition
as
you
were
already
in
your
arrowhead
was
a
great
chief
returned
the
woman
proudly
he
had
his
merits
he
had
and
he
had
his
demerits
too
but
june
you
are
not
desarted
nor
will
you
be
soon
let
your
grief
out
let
it
out
according
to
natur
and
when
the
proper
time
comes
i
shall
have
more
to
say
to
pathfinder
now
went
to
his
own
canoe
and
he
left
the
island
in
the
course
of
the
day
june
heard
the
crack
of
his
rifle
once
or
twice
and
as
the
sun
was
setting
he
reappeared
bringing
her
birds
ready
cooked
and
of
a
delicacy
and
flavor
that
might
have
tempted
the
appetite
of
an
epicure
this
species
of
intercourse
lasted
a
month
june
obstinately
refusing
to
abandon
the
grave
of
her
husband
all
that
time
though
she
still
accepted
the
friendly
offerings
of
her
protector
occasionally
they
met
and
conversed
pathfinder
sounding
the
state
of
the
feelings
but
the
interviews
were
short
and
far
from
frequent
june
slept
in
one
of
the
huts
and
she
laid
down
her
head
in
security
for
she
was
conscious
of
the
protection
of
a
friend
though
pathfinder
invariably
retired
at
night
to
an
adjacent
island
where
he
had
built
himself
a
hut
at
the
end
of
the
month
however
the
season
was
getting
to
be
too
far
advanced
to
render
her
situation
pleasant
to
june
the
trees
had
lost
their
leaves
and
the
nights
were
becoming
cold
and
wintry
it
was
time
to
depart
at
this
moment
chingachgook
reappeared
he
had
a
long
and
confidential
interview
on
the
island
with
his
friend
june
witnessed
their
movements
and
she
saw
that
her
guardian
was
distressed
stealing
to
his
side
she
endeavored
to
soothe
his
sorrow
with
a
woman
gentleness
and
with
a
woman
instinct
thank
you
june
thank
you
he
said
is
well
meant
though
useless
but
it
is
time
to
quit
this
place
we
shall
depart
you
will
go
with
us
for
now
you
got
to
feel
june
assented
in
the
meek
manner
of
an
indian
woman
and
she
withdrew
to
pass
the
remainder
of
her
time
near
the
grave
of
arrowhead
regardless
of
the
hour
and
the
season
the
young
widow
did
not
pillow
her
head
during
the
whole
of
that
autumnal
night
she
sat
near
the
spot
that
held
the
remains
of
her
husband
and
prayed
in
the
manner
of
her
people
for
his
success
on
the
endless
path
on
which
he
had
so
lately
gone
and
for
their
reunion
in
the
land
of
the
just
humble
and
degraded
as
she
would
have
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
the
sophisticated
and
unreflecting
the
image
of
god
was
on
her
soul
and
it
vindicated
its
divine
origin
by
aspirations
and
feelings
that
would
have
surprised
those
who
feigning
more
feel
less
in
the
morning
the
three
departed
pathfinder
earnest
and
intelligent
in
all
he
did
the
great
serpent
silent
and
imitative
and
june
meek
resigned
but
sorrowful
they
went
in
two
canoes
that
of
the
woman
being
abandoned
chingachgook
led
the
way
and
pathfinder
followed
the
course
being
up
stream
two
days
they
paddled
westward
and
as
many
nights
they
encamped
on
islands
fortunately
the
weather
became
mild
and
when
they
reached
the
lake
it
was
found
smooth
and
glassy
as
a
pond
it
was
the
indian
summer
and
the
calms
and
almost
the
blandness
of
june
slept
in
the
hazy
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
oswego
where
the
fort
and
the
sleeping
ensign
invited
them
in
vain
to
enter
without
casting
a
look
aside
chingachgook
paddled
past
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
and
pathfinder
still
followed
in
silent
industry
the
ramparts
were
crowded
with
spectators
but
lundie
who
knew
the
persons
of
his
old
friends
refused
to
allow
them
to
be
even
hailed
it
was
noon
when
chingachgook
entered
a
little
bay
where
the
lay
at
anchor
in
a
sort
of
roadstead
a
small
ancient
clearing
was
on
the
shore
and
near
the
margin
of
the
lake
was
a
log
dwelling
recently
and
completely
though
rudely
fitted
up
there
was
an
air
of
frontier
comfort
and
of
frontier
abundance
around
the
place
though
it
was
necessarily
wild
and
solitary
jasper
stood
on
the
shore
and
when
pathfinder
landed
he
was
the
first
to
take
him
by
the
hand
the
meeting
was
simple
but
very
cordial
no
questions
were
asked
it
being
apparent
that
chingachgook
had
made
the
necessary
explanations
pathfinder
never
squeezed
his
friend
hand
more
cordially
than
in
this
interview
and
he
even
laughed
cordially
in
his
face
as
he
told
him
how
happy
and
well
he
appeared
where
is
she
jasper
where
is
she
the
guide
at
length
whispered
for
at
first
he
had
seemed
to
be
afraid
to
trust
himself
with
the
question
she
is
waiting
for
us
in
the
house
my
dear
friend
where
you
see
that
june
has
already
hastened
before
june
may
use
a
lighter
step
to
meet
mabel
but
she
can
not
carry
a
lighter
heart
and
so
lad
you
found
the
chaplain
at
the
garrison
and
all
was
soon
settled
we
were
married
within
a
week
after
we
left
you
and
master
cap
departed
next
day
you
have
forgotten
to
inquire
about
your
friend
not
i
not
i
the
sarpent
has
told
me
all
that
and
then
i
love
to
hear
so
much
of
mabel
and
her
happiness
i
do
did
the
child
smile
or
did
she
weep
when
the
ceremony
was
over
she
did
both
my
friend
but
yes
that
their
natur
tearful
and
cheerful
ah
me
they
are
very
pleasant
to
us
of
the
woods
and
i
do
believe
i
should
think
all
right
whatever
mabel
might
do
and
do
you
think
jasper
that
she
thought
of
me
at
all
on
that
joyful
occasion
i
know
she
did
pathfinder
and
she
thinks
of
you
and
talks
of
you
daily
almost
hourly
none
love
you
as
we
i
know
few
love
me
better
than
yourself
jasper
chingachgook
is
perhaps
now
the
only
creatur
of
whom
i
can
say
that
well
no
use
in
putting
it
off
any
longer
it
must
be
done
and
may
as
well
be
done
at
once
so
jasper
lead
the
way
and
i
endivor
to
look
upon
her
sweet
countenance
once
jasper
did
lead
the
way
and
they
were
soon
in
the
presence
of
mabel
the
latter
met
her
late
suitor
with
a
bright
blush
and
her
limbs
trembled
so
she
could
hardly
stand
still
her
manner
was
affectionate
and
frank
during
the
hour
of
pathfinder
visit
for
it
lasted
no
longer
though
he
ate
in
the
dwelling
of
his
friends
one
who
was
expert
in
tracing
the
working
of
the
human
mind
might
have
seen
a
faithful
index
to
the
feelings
of
mabel
in
her
manner
to
pathfinder
and
her
husband
with
the
latter
she
still
had
a
little
of
the
reserve
that
usually
accompanies
young
wedlock
but
the
tones
of
her
voice
were
kinder
even
than
common
the
glance
of
her
eye
was
tender
and
she
seldom
looked
at
him
without
the
glow
that
tinged
her
cheeks
betraying
the
existence
of
feelings
that
habit
and
time
had
not
yet
soothed
into
absolute
tranquillity
with
pathfinder
all
was
earnest
sincere
even
anxious
but
the
tones
never
trembled
the
eye
never
fell
and
if
the
cheek
flushed
it
was
with
the
emotions
that
are
connected
with
concern
at
length
the
moment
came
when
pathfinder
must
go
his
way
chingachgook
had
already
abandoned
the
canoes
and
was
posted
on
the
margin
of
the
woods
where
a
path
led
into
the
forest
here
he
calmly
waited
to
be
joined
by
his
friend
as
soon
as
the
latter
was
aware
of
this
fact
he
rose
in
a
solemn
manner
and
took
his
leave
i
sometimes
thought
that
my
own
fate
has
been
a
little
hard
he
said
but
that
of
this
woman
mabel
has
shamed
me
into
june
remains
and
lives
with
me
eagerly
interrupted
our
heroine
so
i
comprehend
it
if
anybody
can
bring
her
back
from
her
grief
and
make
her
wish
to
live
you
can
do
it
mabel
though
i
misgivings
about
even
your
success
the
poor
creatur
is
without
a
tribe
as
well
as
without
a
husband
and
it
not
easy
to
reconcile
the
feelings
to
both
losses
ah
me
what
have
i
to
do
with
other
people
miseries
and
marriages
as
if
i
had
affliction
enough
of
my
own
do
speak
to
me
mabel
do
speak
to
me
jasper
let
me
go
my
way
in
peace
and
like
a
man
i
seen
your
happiness
and
that
is
a
great
deal
and
i
shall
be
able
to
bear
my
own
sorrow
all
the
better
for
it
no
never
kiss
you
mabel
i
never
kiss
you
here
my
hand
jasper
squeeze
it
boy
squeeze
it
no
fear
of
its
giving
way
for
it
the
hand
of
a
man
and
now
mabel
do
you
take
it
nay
you
must
not
do
this
preventing
mabel
from
kissing
it
and
bathing
it
in
her
tears
you
must
not
do
this
pathfinder
asked
mabel
when
shall
we
see
you
again
i
thought
of
that
too
yes
i
thought
of
that
i
have
if
the
time
should
ever
come
when
i
can
look
upon
you
altogether
as
a
sister
mabel
or
a
child
it
might
be
better
to
say
a
child
since
young
enough
to
be
my
daughter
depend
on
it
i
come
back
for
it
would
lighten
my
very
heart
to
witness
your
gladness
but
if
i
can
not
farewell
farewell
the
sergeant
was
wrong
yes
the
sergeant
was
wrong
this
was
the
last
the
pathfinder
ever
uttered
to
the
ears
of
jasper
western
and
mabel
dunham
he
turned
away
as
if
the
words
choked
him
and
was
quickly
at
the
side
of
his
friend
as
soon
as
the
latter
saw
him
approach
he
shouldered
his
own
burthen
and
glided
in
among
the
trees
without
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
mabel
her
husband
and
june
all
watched
the
form
of
the
pathfinder
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
parting
gesture
or
a
stolen
glance
of
the
eye
but
he
did
not
look
back
once
or
twice
they
thought
they
saw
his
head
shake
as
one
trembles
in
bitterness
of
spirit
and
a
toss
of
the
hand
was
given
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
watched
but
a
tread
whose
vigor
no
sorrow
could
enfeeble
soon
bore
him
out
of
view
and
was
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
neither
jasper
nor
his
wife
ever
beheld
the
pathfinder
again
they
remained
for
another
year
on
the
banks
of
ontario
and
then
the
pressing
solicitations
of
cap
induced
them
to
join
him
in
new
york
where
jasper
eventually
became
a
successful
and
respected
merchant
thrice
mabel
received
valuable
presents
of
furs
at
intervals
of
years
and
her
feelings
told
her
whence
they
came
though
no
name
accompanied
the
gift
later
in
life
still
when
the
mother
of
several
youths
she
had
occasion
to
visit
the
interior
and
found
herself
on
the
banks
of
the
mohawk
accompanied
by
her
sons
the
eldest
of
whom
was
capable
of
being
her
protector
on
that
occasion
she
observed
a
man
in
a
singular
guise
watching
her
in
the
distance
with
an
intentness
that
induced
her
to
inquire
into
his
pursuits
and
character
she
was
told
he
was
the
most
renowned
hunter
of
that
portion
of
the
state
it
was
after
the
revolution
a
being
of
great
purity
of
character
and
of
as
marked
peculiarities
and
that
he
was
known
in
that
region
of
country
by
the
name
of
the
leatherstocking
further
than
this
western
could
not
ascertain
though
the
distant
glimpse
and
singular
deportment
of
this
unknown
hunter
gave
her
a
sleepless
night
and
cast
a
shade
of
melancholy
over
her
still
lovely
face
that
lasted
many
a
day
as
for
june
the
double
loss
of
husband
and
tribe
produced
the
effect
that
pathfinder
had
foreseen
she
died
in
the
cottage
of
mabel
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
jasper
conveyed
her
body
to
the
island
where
he
interred
it
by
the
side
of
that
of
arrowhead
lundie
lived
to
marry
his
ancient
love
and
retired
a
and
battered
veteran
but
his
name
has
been
rendered
illustrious
in
our
own
time
by
the
deeds
of
a
younger
brother
who
succeeded
to
his
territorial
title
which
however
was
shortly
after
merged
in
one
earned
by
his
valor
on
the
ocean
