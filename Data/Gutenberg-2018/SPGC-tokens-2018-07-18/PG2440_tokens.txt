vol
iii
in
april
the
author
of
the
present
volume
left
england
in
company
with
wallace
who
has
since
acquired
wide
fame
in
connection
with
the
darwinian
theory
of
natural
selection
on
a
joint
expedition
up
the
river
amazons
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
the
natural
history
of
the
vast
traversed
by
that
mighty
river
and
its
numerous
tributaries
wallace
returned
to
england
after
four
years
stay
and
was
we
believe
unlucky
enough
to
lose
the
greater
part
of
his
collections
by
the
shipwreck
of
the
vessel
in
which
he
had
transmitted
them
to
london
bates
prolonged
his
residence
in
the
amazon
valley
seven
years
after
wallace
departure
and
did
not
revisit
his
native
country
again
until
bates
was
also
more
fortunate
than
his
companion
in
bringing
his
gathered
treasures
home
to
england
in
safety
so
great
indeed
was
the
mass
of
specimens
accumulated
by
bates
during
his
eleven
years
researches
that
upon
the
working
out
of
his
collection
which
has
been
accomplished
or
is
now
in
course
of
being
accomplished
by
different
scientific
naturalists
in
this
country
it
has
been
ascertained
that
representatives
of
no
less
than
species
are
amongst
them
of
which
about
were
previously
unknown
to
science
it
may
be
remarked
that
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
these
species
namely
about
belong
to
the
class
of
insects
to
the
study
of
which
bates
principally
devoted
his
attention
being
as
is
well
known
himself
recognised
as
no
mean
authority
as
regards
this
class
of
organic
beings
in
his
present
volume
however
bates
does
not
confine
himself
to
his
entomological
discoveries
nor
to
any
other
branch
of
natural
history
but
supplies
a
general
outline
of
his
adventures
during
his
journeyings
up
and
down
the
mighty
river
and
a
variety
of
information
concerning
every
object
of
interest
whether
physical
or
political
that
he
met
with
by
the
way
bates
landed
at
para
in
may
his
first
part
is
entirely
taken
up
with
an
account
of
the
lower
amazons
that
is
the
river
from
its
sources
up
to
the
city
of
manaos
or
barra
do
rio
negro
where
it
is
joined
by
the
large
northern
confluent
of
that
name
and
with
a
narrative
of
his
residence
at
para
and
his
various
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
of
that
city
the
large
collection
made
by
bates
of
the
animal
productions
of
para
enabled
him
to
arrive
at
the
following
conclusions
regarding
the
relations
of
the
fauna
of
the
south
side
of
the
amazonian
delta
with
those
of
other
regions
it
is
generally
allowed
that
guiana
and
brazil
to
the
north
and
south
of
the
para
district
form
two
distinct
provinces
as
regards
their
animal
and
vegetable
inhabitants
by
this
it
means
that
the
two
regions
have
a
very
large
number
of
forms
peculiar
to
themselves
and
which
are
supposed
not
to
have
been
derived
from
other
quarters
during
modern
geological
times
each
may
be
considered
as
a
centre
of
distribution
in
the
latest
process
of
dissemination
of
species
over
the
surface
of
tropical
america
para
lies
midway
between
the
two
centres
each
of
which
has
a
nucleus
of
elevated
whilst
the
intermediate
valley
forms
a
wide
extent
of
country
it
is
therefore
interesting
to
ascertain
from
which
the
latter
received
its
population
or
whether
it
contains
so
large
a
number
of
endemic
species
as
would
warrant
the
conclusion
that
it
is
itself
an
independent
province
to
assist
in
deciding
such
questions
as
these
we
must
compare
closely
the
species
found
in
the
district
with
those
of
the
other
contiguous
regions
and
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
they
are
identical
or
only
slightly
modified
or
whether
they
are
highly
peculiar
von
martius
when
he
visited
this
part
of
brazil
forty
years
ago
coming
from
the
south
was
much
struck
with
the
dissimilarity
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
productions
to
those
of
other
parts
of
brazil
in
fact
the
fauna
of
para
and
the
lower
part
of
the
amazons
has
no
close
relationship
with
that
of
brazil
proper
but
it
has
a
very
great
affinity
with
that
of
the
coast
region
of
guiana
from
cayenne
to
demerara
if
we
may
judge
from
the
results
afforded
by
the
study
of
certain
families
of
insects
no
peculiar
brazilian
forms
are
found
in
the
para
district
whilst
more
than
of
the
total
number
are
essentially
guiana
species
being
found
nowhere
else
but
in
guiana
and
amazonia
many
of
them
however
are
modified
from
the
guiana
type
and
about
seem
to
be
restricted
to
para
these
endemic
species
are
not
highly
peculiar
and
they
may
yet
be
found
over
a
great
part
of
northern
brazil
when
the
country
is
better
explored
they
do
not
warrant
us
in
concluding
that
the
district
forms
an
independent
province
although
they
show
that
its
fauna
is
not
wholly
derivative
and
that
the
land
is
probably
not
entirely
a
new
formation
from
all
these
facts
i
think
we
must
conclude
that
the
para
district
belongs
to
the
guiana
province
and
that
if
it
is
newer
land
than
guiana
it
must
have
received
the
great
bulk
of
its
animal
population
from
that
region
i
am
informed
by
sclater
that
similar
results
are
derivable
from
the
comparison
of
the
birds
of
these
countries
one
of
the
most
interesting
excursions
made
by
bates
from
para
was
the
ascent
of
the
river
tocantins
the
mouth
of
which
lies
about
miles
from
the
city
of
para
this
was
twice
attempted
on
the
second
occasion
our
author
being
in
company
with
wallace
the
travellers
penetrated
as
far
as
the
rapids
of
arroyos
about
miles
from
its
mouth
this
district
is
one
of
the
chief
of
the
bertholletia
excelsa
which
is
here
very
plentiful
grove
after
grove
of
these
splendid
trees
being
visible
towering
above
their
fellows
with
the
woody
fruits
large
and
round
as
dotted
over
the
branches
the
hyacinthine
macaw
ara
hyacinthina
is
another
natural
wonder
first
met
with
here
this
splendid
bird
which
is
occasionally
brought
alive
to
the
zoological
gardens
of
europe
only
occurs
in
the
interior
of
brazil
from
to
the
southern
border
of
the
amazon
valley
its
enormous
beak
which
must
strike
even
the
most
unobservant
with
wonder
appears
to
be
adapted
to
enable
it
to
feed
on
the
nuts
of
the
mucuja
palm
acrocomia
lasiospatha
these
nuts
which
are
so
hard
as
to
be
difficult
to
break
with
a
heavy
hammer
are
crushed
to
a
pulp
by
the
powerful
beak
of
this
macaw
bates
later
part
is
mainly
devoted
to
his
residence
at
santarem
at
the
junction
of
the
rio
tapajos
with
the
main
stream
and
to
his
account
of
upper
amazon
or
solimoens
the
fauna
of
which
is
as
we
shall
presently
see
in
many
respects
very
different
from
that
of
the
lower
part
of
the
river
at
santarem
the
most
important
and
most
civilised
settlement
on
the
amazon
between
the
atlantic
and
para
bates
made
his
headquarters
for
three
years
and
a
half
during
which
time
several
excursions
up
the
tapajos
were
effected
some
miles
up
the
stream
on
its
affluent
the
cupari
a
new
fauna
for
the
most
part
very
distinct
from
that
of
the
lower
part
of
the
same
stream
was
entered
upon
at
the
same
time
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
cupari
species
were
identical
with
those
of
ega
on
the
upper
amazon
a
district
eight
times
further
removed
than
the
village
just
mentioned
bates
was
more
successful
here
than
on
his
excursion
up
the
tocantins
and
obtained
twenty
new
species
of
fishes
and
many
new
and
conspicuous
insects
apparently
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
amazonian
valley
in
a
later
chapter
bates
commences
his
account
of
the
solimoens
or
upper
amazons
on
the
banks
of
which
he
passed
four
years
and
a
half
the
country
is
a
magnificent
wilderness
where
civilised
man
has
as
yet
scarcely
obtained
a
cultivated
ground
from
the
rio
negro
to
the
andes
amounting
only
to
a
few
score
acres
during
the
whole
of
this
time
bates
headquarters
were
at
ega
on
the
teffe
a
confluent
of
the
great
river
from
the
south
whence
excursions
were
made
sometimes
for
or
miles
into
the
interior
in
the
intervals
bates
followed
his
pursuit
as
a
collecting
naturalist
in
the
same
peaceful
regular
way
as
he
might
have
done
in
a
european
village
our
author
draws
a
most
striking
picture
of
the
quiet
secluded
life
he
led
in
this
spot
the
difficulty
of
getting
news
and
the
want
of
intellectual
society
were
the
great
drawbacks
the
latter
increasing
until
it
became
almost
insupportable
i
was
obliged
at
last
bates
naively
remarks
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
contemplation
of
nature
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
fill
the
human
heart
and
mind
bates
must
indeed
have
been
driven
to
great
straits
as
regards
his
mental
food
when
as
he
tell
us
he
took
to
reading
the
athenaeum
three
times
over
the
first
time
devouring
the
more
interesting
articles
the
second
the
whole
of
the
remainder
and
the
third
reading
all
the
advertisements
from
beginning
to
end
ega
was
indeed
as
bates
remarks
a
fine
field
for
a
natural
history
collector
the
only
previous
scientific
visitants
to
that
region
having
been
the
german
naturalists
spix
and
martius
and
the
count
de
castelnau
when
he
descended
the
amazons
from
the
pacific
bates
account
of
the
monkeys
of
the
genera
brachyuyus
nyctipithecus
and
midas
met
with
in
this
region
and
the
whole
of
the
very
pregnant
remarks
which
follow
on
the
american
forms
of
the
quadrumana
will
be
read
with
interest
by
every
one
particularly
by
those
who
pay
attention
to
the
important
subject
of
geographical
distribution
we
need
hardly
say
that
bates
after
the
attention
he
has
bestowed
upon
this
question
is
a
zealous
advocate
of
the
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
species
by
derivation
from
a
common
stock
after
giving
an
outline
of
the
general
distribution
of
monkeys
he
clearly
argues
that
unless
the
common
origin
at
least
of
the
species
of
a
family
be
admitted
the
problem
of
their
distribution
must
remain
an
inexplicable
mystery
bates
evidently
thoroughly
understands
the
nature
of
this
interesting
problem
and
in
another
passage
in
which
the
very
singular
distribution
of
the
butterflies
of
the
genus
heliconius
is
enlarged
upon
concludes
with
the
following
significant
remarks
upon
this
important
subject
in
the
controversy
which
is
being
waged
amongst
naturalists
since
the
publication
of
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
it
has
been
rightly
said
that
no
proof
at
present
existed
of
the
production
of
a
physiological
species
that
is
a
form
which
will
not
interbreed
with
the
one
from
which
it
was
derived
although
given
ample
opportunities
of
doing
so
and
does
not
exhibit
signs
of
reverting
to
its
parent
form
when
placed
under
the
same
conditions
with
it
morphological
species
that
is
forms
which
differ
to
an
amount
that
would
justify
their
being
considered
good
species
have
been
produced
in
plenty
through
selection
by
man
out
of
variations
arising
under
domestication
or
cultivation
the
facts
just
given
are
therefore
of
some
scientific
importance
for
they
tend
to
show
that
a
physiological
species
can
be
and
is
produced
in
nature
out
of
the
varieties
of
a
closely
allied
one
this
is
not
an
isolated
case
for
i
observed
in
the
course
of
my
travels
a
number
of
similar
instances
but
in
very
few
has
it
happened
that
the
species
which
clearly
appears
to
be
the
parent
with
one
that
has
been
evidently
derived
from
it
generally
the
supposed
parent
also
seems
to
have
been
modified
and
then
the
demonstration
is
not
so
clear
for
some
of
the
links
in
the
chain
of
variation
are
wanting
the
process
of
origination
of
a
species
in
nature
as
it
takes
place
successively
must
be
ever
perhaps
beyond
man
power
to
trace
on
account
of
the
great
lapse
of
time
it
requires
but
we
can
obtain
a
fair
view
of
it
by
tracing
a
variable
and
species
over
the
wide
area
of
its
present
distribution
and
a
long
observation
of
such
will
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
new
species
must
in
all
cases
have
arisen
out
of
variable
and
forms
it
sometimes
happens
as
in
the
present
instance
that
we
find
in
one
locality
a
species
under
a
certain
form
which
is
constant
to
all
the
individuals
concerned
in
another
exhibiting
numerous
varieties
and
in
a
third
presenting
itself
as
a
constant
form
quite
distinct
from
the
one
we
set
out
with
if
we
meet
with
any
two
of
these
modifications
living
side
by
side
and
maintaining
their
distinctive
characters
under
such
circumstances
the
proof
of
the
natural
origination
of
a
species
is
complete
it
could
not
be
much
more
so
were
we
able
to
watch
the
process
step
by
step
it
might
be
objected
that
the
difference
between
our
two
species
is
but
slight
and
that
by
classing
them
as
varieties
nothing
further
would
be
proved
by
them
but
the
differences
between
them
are
such
as
obtain
between
allied
species
generally
large
genera
are
composed
in
great
part
of
such
species
and
it
is
interesting
to
show
the
great
and
beautiful
diversity
within
a
large
genus
as
brought
about
by
the
working
of
laws
within
our
comprehension
but
to
return
to
the
zoological
wonders
of
the
upper
amazon
birds
insects
and
butterflies
are
all
spoken
of
by
bates
in
his
chapter
on
the
natural
features
of
the
district
and
it
is
evident
that
none
of
these
classes
of
beings
escaped
the
observation
of
his
watchful
intelligence
the
account
of
the
foraging
ants
of
the
genus
eciton
is
certainly
marvellous
and
would
even
of
itself
be
sufficient
to
stamp
the
recorder
of
their
habits
as
a
man
of
no
ordinary
mark
the
last
chapter
of
bates
work
contains
the
account
of
his
excursions
beyond
ega
fonteboa
tunantins
a
small
settlement
miles
up
the
stream
and
san
paulo
de
olivenca
some
miles
higher
up
were
the
principal
places
visited
and
new
acquisitions
were
gathered
at
each
of
these
localities
in
the
fourth
month
of
bates
residence
at
the
place
a
severe
attack
of
ague
led
to
the
abandonment
of
the
plans
he
had
formed
of
proceeding
to
the
peruvian
towns
of
pebas
and
moyobamba
and
so
completing
the
examination
of
the
natural
history
of
the
amazonian
plains
up
to
the
foot
of
the
andes
this
attack
which
seemed
to
be
the
culmination
of
a
gradual
deterioration
of
health
caused
by
eleven
years
hard
work
under
the
tropics
induced
him
to
return
to
ega
and
finally
to
para
where
he
embarked
on
the
june
for
england
naturally
enough
bates
tells
us
he
was
at
first
a
little
dismayed
at
leaving
the
equator
where
the
forces
of
nature
maintain
a
and
a
climate
typical
of
mind
and
order
and
beauty
to
sail
towards
the
crepuscular
skies
of
the
cold
north
but
he
consoles
us
by
adding
the
remark
that
three
renewed
experience
of
england
have
convinced
him
how
incomparably
superior
is
civilised
life
to
the
spiritual
sterility
of
existence

i
have
thought
it

presuppose

than
an

has
a
right
to
expect
of
the

the
personal

been

entire
together
with
those
descriptive
details
likely
to
interest
all
classes
young
and
old
relating
to
the

and
the
wonderful

through
which
it
flows

luxuriant

signs
are
not
wanting
that
this
fertile
but
scantily
peopled
region
will
soon
become
through
recent
efforts
of
the
peruvian
and
brazilian
governments
to
make
it
accessible
and
colonise
it
of
far
higher
importance
to
the
nations
of
northern
europe
than
it
has
been
hitherto
the
full
significance
of
the
title
the
largest
river
in
the
world
which
we
are
all
taught
in
our
schoolboy
days
to
apply
to
the
amazons
without
having
a
distinct
idea
of
its
magnitude
will
then
become
apparent
to
the
english
public
it
will
be
new
to
most
people
that
this
noble
stream
has
recently
been
navigated
by
steamers
to
a
distance
of
geographical
miles
from
its
mouth
at
para
or
double
the
distance
which
vessels
are
able
to
reach
on
the
the
largest
river
of
the
old
world
the
depth
of
water
in
the
dry
season
being
about
seven
fathoms
up
to
this
terminus
of
navigation
it
is
not
however
the
length
of
the
trunk
stream
that
has
earned
for
the
amazons
the
appellation
of
the
mediterranean
of
south
america
given
it
by
the
brazilians
of
para
but
the
network
of
and
lakes
which
everywhere
accompanies
its
course
at
a
distance
from
the
banks
and
which
adds
many
thousands
of
miles
of
easy
inland
navigation
to
the
total
presented
by
the
main
river
and
its
tributaries
the
peruvians
especially
if
i
may
judge
from
letters
received
within
the
past
few
weeks
seem
to
be
stirring
themselves
to
grasp
the
advantages
which
the
possession
of
the
upper
course
of
the
river
places
within
their
reach
vessels
of
heavy
tonnage
have
arrived
in
para
from
england
with
materials
for
the
formation
of
shipbuilding
establishments
at
a
point
situated
two
thousand
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
peruvian
steamers
have
navigated
from
the
andes
to
the
atlantic
and
a
quantity
of
cotton
now
exported
for
the
first
time
the
product

the
rich

healthy

bordering
the
upper
amazons
has
been
conveyed
by
this
means
and

to
europe
the
probability
of
general
curiosity
in
england
being
excited
before
long
with
regard
to
this
hitherto
neglected
country
will
be
considered
of
itself
a

a

situated
a

miles
to

of

not
permitting
in

a
nearer

and
the
signal
was
hoisted
for
a
pilot
it
was
with
deep
interest
that
my
companion
and
myself
both
now
about
to
see
and
examine
the
beauties
of
a
tropical
country
for
the
first
time
gazed
on
the
land
where
i
at
least
eventually
spent
eleven
of
the
best
years
of
my
life
to
the
eastward
the
country
was
not
remarkable
in
appearance
being
slightly
undulating
with
bare
sandhills
and
scattered
trees
but
to
the
westward
stretching
towards
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
could
see
through
the
captain
glass
a
long
line
of
forest
rising
apparently
out
of
the
water
a
mass
of
tall
trees
broken
into
groups
and
finally
into
single
trees
as
it
dwindled
away
in
the
distance
this
was
the
frontier
in
this
direction
of
the
great
primaeval
forest
characteristic
of
this
region
which
contains
so
many
wonders
in
its
recesses
and
clothes
the
whole
surface
of
the
country
for
two
thousand
miles
from
this
point
to
the
foot
of
the
andes
on
the
following
day
and
night
we
sailed
with
a
light
wind
partly
aided
by
the
tide
up
the
para
river
towards
evening
we
passed
vigia
and
colares
two
fishing
villages
and
saw
many
native
canoes
which
seemed
like
toys
beneath
the
lofty
walls
of
dark
forest
the
air
was
excessively
close
the
sky
overcast
and
sheet
lightning
played
almost
incessantly
around
the
horizon
an
appropriate
greeting
on
the
threshold
of
a
country
lying
close
under
the
equator
the
evening
was
calm
this
being
the
season
when
the
winds
are
not
strong
so
we
glided
along
in
a
noiseless
manner
which
contrasted
pleasantly
with
the
unceasing
turmoil
to
which
we
had
been
lately
accustomed
on
the
atlantic
the
immensity
of
the
river
struck
us
greatly
for
although
sailing
sometimes
at
a
distance
of
eight
or
nine
miles
from
the
eastern
bank
the
opposite
shore
was
at
no
time
visible
indeed
the
para
river
is
miles
in
breadth
at
its
mouth
and
at
the
city
of
para
nearly
seventy
miles
from
the
sea
it
is
twenty
miles
wide
but
at
that
point
a
series
of
islands
commences
which
contracts
the
riverview
in
front
of
the
port
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
we
arrived
at
our
destination
the
appearance
of
the
city
at
sunrise
was
pleasing
in
the
highest
degree
it
is
built
on
a
low
tract
of
land
having
only
one
small
rocky
elevation
at
its
southern
extremity
it
therefore
affords
no
amphitheatral
view
from
the
river
but
the
white
buildings
roofed
with
red
tiles
the
numerous
towers
and
cupolas
of
churches
and
convents
the
crowns
of
palm
trees
reared
above
the
buildings
all
sharply
defined
against
the
clear
blue
sky
give
an
appearance
of
lightness
and
cheerfulness
which
is
most
exhilarating
the
perpetual
forest
hems
the
city
in
on
all
sides
landwards
and
towards
the
suburbs
picturesque
country
houses
are
seen
scattered
about
half
buried
in
luxuriant
foliage
the
port
was
full
of
native
canoes
and
other
vessels
large
and
small
and
the
ringing
of
bells
and
firing
of
rockets
announcing
the
dawn
of
some
roman
catholic
festival
day
showed
that
the
population
was
astir
at
that
early
hour
we
went
ashore
in
due
time
and
were
kindly
received
by
miller
the
consignee
of
the
vessel
who
invited
us
to
make
his
house
our
home
until
we
could
obtain
a
suitable
residence
on
landing
the
hot
moist
mouldy
air
which
seemed
to
strike
from
the
ground
and
walls
reminded
me
of
the
atmosphere
of
tropical
stoves
at
kew
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
a
heavy
shower
fell
and
in
the
evening
the
atmosphere
having
been
cooled
by
the
rain
we
walked
about
a
mile
out
of
town
to
the
residence
of
an
american
gentleman
to
whom
our
host
wished
to
introduce
us
the
impressions
received
during
this
first
walk
can
never
wholly
fade
from
my
mind
after
traversing
the
few
streets
of
tall
gloomy
buildings
near
the
port
inhabited
chiefly
by
merchants
and
shopkeepers
along
which
idle
soldiers
dressed
in
shabby
uniforms
carrying
their
muskets
carelessly
over
their
arms
priests
negresses
with
red
on
their
heads
indian
women
carrying
their
naked
children
astride
on
their
hips
and
other
samples
of
the
motley
life
of
the
place
we
passed
down
a
long
narrow
street
leading
to
the
suburbs
beyond
this
our
road
lay
across
a
grassy
common
into
a
picturesque
lane
leading
to
the
virgin
forest
the
long
street
was
inhabited
by
the
poorer
class
of
the
population
the
houses
were
of
one
story
only
and
had
an
irregular
and
mean
appearance
the
windows
were
without
glass
having
instead
projecting
lattice
casements
the
street
was
unpaved
and
inches
deep
in
loose
sand
groups
of
people
were
cooling
themselves
outside
their
doors
people
of
all
shades
in
colour
of
skin
european
negro
and
indian
but
chiefly
an
uncertain
mixture
of
the
three
amongst
them
were
several
handsome
women
dressed
in
a
slovenly
manner
barefoot
or
shod
in
loose
slippers
but
wearing
decorated
earrings
and
around
their
necks
strings
of
very
large
gold
beads
they
had
dark
expressive
eyes
and
remarkably
rich
heads
of
hair
it
was
a
mere
fancy
but
i
thought
the
mingled
squalor
luxuriance
and
beauty
of
these
women
were
pointedly
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
so
striking
in
the
view
was
the
mixture
of
natural
riches
and
human
poverty
the
houses
were
mostly
in
a
dilapidated
condition
and
signs
of
indolence
and
neglect
were
visible
everywhere
the
wooden
palings
which
surrounded
the
gardens
were
strewn
about
and
broken
hogs
goats
and
poultry
wandered
in
and
out
through
the
gaps
but
amidst
all
and
compensating
every
defect
rose
the
overpowering
beauty
of
the
vegetation
the
massive
dark
crowns
of
shady
mangos
were
seen
everywhere
amongst
the
dwellings
amidst
fragrant
blossoming
orange
lemon
and
many
other
tropical
fruit
trees
some
in
flower
others
in
fruit
at
varying
stages
of
ripeness
here
and
there
shooting
above
the
more
and
sombre
trees
were
the
smooth
columnar
stems
of
palms
bearing
aloft
their
magnificent
crowns
of
fronds
amongst
the
latter
the
slim
was
especially
noticeable
growing
in
groups
of
four
or
five
its
smooth
stem
twenty
to
thirty
feet
high
terminating
in
a
head
of
feathery
foliage
inexpressibly
light
and
elegant
in
outline
on
the
boughs
of
the
taller
and
more
trees
sat
tufts
of
leaved
parasites
slender
woody
lianas
hung
in
festoons
from
the
branches
or
were
suspended
in
the
form
of
cords
and
ribbons
whilst
luxuriant
creeping
plants
overran
alike
roofs
and
walls
or
toppled
over
palings
in
a
copious
profusion
of
foliage
the
superb
banana
musa
paradisiaca
of
which
i
had
always
read
as
forming
one
of
the
charms
of
tropical
vegetation
grew
here
with
great
luxuriance
its
glossy
leaves
twelve
feet
in
length
curving
over
the
roofs
of
verandahs
in
the
rear
of
every
house
the
shape
of
the
leaves
the
varying
shades
of
green
which
they
present
when
lightly
moved
by
the
wind
and
especially
the
contrast
they
afford
in
colour
and
form
to
the
more
sombre
hues
and
more
rounded
outline
of
the
other
trees
are
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
the
charm
of
this
glorious
tree
strange
forms
of
vegetation
drew
our
attention
at
almost
every
step
amongst
them
were
the
different
kinds
of
bromelia
or
pineapple
plants
with
their
long
rigid
leaves
in
some
species
jagged
or
toothed
along
their
edges
then
there
was
the
tree
an
importation
it
is
true
but
remarkable
from
its
large
glossy
dark
green
strongly
digitated
foliage
and
its
interesting
history
many
other
trees
and
plants
curious
in
leaf
stem
or
manner
of
growth
grew
on
the
borders
of
the
thickets
along
which
lay
our
road
they
were
all
attractive
to
newcomers
whose
last
country
ramble
of
quite
recent
date
was
over
the
bleak
moors
of
derbyshire
on
a
sleety
morning
in
april
as
we
continued
our
walk
the
brief
twilight
commenced
and
the
sounds
of
multifarious
life
came
from
the
vegetation
around
the
whirring
of
cicadas
the
shrill
stridulation
of
a
vast
number
and
variety
of
field
crickets
and
grasshoppers
each
species
sounding
its
peculiar
note
the
plaintive
hooting
of
tree
frogs
all
blended
together
in
one
continuous
ringing
sound
the
audible
expression
of
the
teeming
profusion
of
nature
as
night
came
on
many
species
of
frogs
and
toads
in
the
marshy
places
joined
in
the
chorus
their
croaking
and
drumming
far
louder
than
anything
i
had
before
heard
in
the
same
line
being
added
to
the
other
noises
created
an
almost
deafening
din
this
uproar
of
life
i
afterwards
found
never
wholly
ceased
night
or
day
in
the
course
of
time
i
became
like
other
residents
accustomed
to
it
it
is
however
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
a
tropical
at
least
a
brazilian
climate
which
is
most
likely
to
surprise
a
stranger
after
my
return
to
england
the
deathlike
stillness
of
summer
days
in
the
country
appeared
to
me
as
strange
as
the
ringing
uproar
did
on
my
first
arrival
at
para
the
object
of
our
visit
being
accomplished
we
returned
to
the
city
the
were
then
out
in
great
numbers
flitting
about
the
sombre
woods
and
even
the
frequented
streets
we
turned
into
our
hammocks
well
pleased
with
what
we
had
seen
and
full
of
anticipation
with
regard
to
the
wealth
of
natural
objects
we
had
come
to
explore
during
the
first
few
days
we
were
employed
in
landing
our
baggage
and
arranging
our
extensive
apparatus
we
then
accepted
the
invitation
of
miller
to
make
use
of
his
rocinha
or
in
the
suburbs
until
we
finally
decided
on
a
residence
upon
this
we
made
our
first
essay
in
housekeeping
we
bought
cotton
hammocks
the
universal
substitute
for
beds
in
this
country
cooking
utensils
and
crockery
and
engaged
a
free
negro
named
isidoro
as
cook
and
our
first
walks
were
in
the
immediate
suburbs
of
para
the
city
lies
on
a
corner
of
land
formed
by
the
junction
of
the
river
guama
with
the
para
as
i
have
said
before
the
forest
which
covers
the
whole
country
extends
close
up
to
the
city
streets
indeed
the
town
is
built
on
a
tract
of
cleared
land
and
is
kept
free
from
the
jungle
only
by
the
constant
care
of
the
government
the
surface
though
everywhere
low
is
slightly
undulating
so
that
areas
of
dry
land
alternate
throughout
with
areas
of
swampy
ground
the
vegetation
and
animal
tenants
of
the
two
being
widely
different
our
residence
lay
on
the
side
of
the
city
nearest
the
guama
on
the
borders
of
one
of
the
low
and
swampy
areas
which
here
extends
over
a
portion
of
the
suburbs
the
tract
of
land
is
intersected
by
suburban
roads
the
chief
of
which
the
estrada
das
mongubeiras
the
monguba
road
about
a
mile
long
is
a
magnificent
avenue
of
trees
bombax
monguba
and
ceiba
huge
trees
whose
trunks
taper
rapidly
from
the
ground
upwards
and
whose
flowers
before
opening
look
like
red
balls
studding
the
branches
this
fine
road
was
constructed
under
the
governorship
of
the
count
dos
arcos
about
the
year
at
right
angles
to
it
run
a
number
of
narrow
green
lanes
and
the
whole
district
is
drained
by
a
system
of
small
canals
or
trenches
through
which
the
tide
ebbs
and
flows
showing
the
lowness
of
the
site
before
i
left
the
country
other
enterprising
presidents
had
formed
a
number
of
avenues
lined
with
cocoanut
palms
almond
and
other
trees
in
continuation
of
the
monguba
road
over
the
more
elevated
and
drier
ground
to
the
of
the
city
on
the
high
ground
the
vegetation
has
an
aspect
quite
different
from
that
which
it
presents
in
the
swampy
parts
indeed
with
the
exception
of
the
palm
trees
the
suburbs
here
have
an
aspect
like
that
of
a
village
green
at
home
the
soil
is
sandy
and
the
open
commons
are
covered
with
a
short
grassy
and
shrubby
vegetation
beyond
this
the
land
again
descends
to
a
marshy
tract
where
at
the
bottom
of
the
moist
hollows
the
public
wells
are
situated
here
all
the
linen
of
the

of
noisy
negresses

here
also
the
are
filled
painted
hogsheads
on

drawn
by
bullocks
in
early
morning
when
the
sun
sometimes
shines
through
a
light
mist
and
everything
is
dripping
with
moisture
this
part
of
the
city
is
full
of
life
vociferous
negroes
and
wrangling
gallegos
natives
of

in

who
follow
this
occupation
in
lisbon
and
oporto
as
well
as
at

the
proprietors
of
the
are
gathered
about
jabbering
continually
and
taking
their
morning
drams
in
dirty
wineshops
at
the
street
corners
along
these
beautiful
roads
we
found
much
to
interest
us
during
the
first
few
days
suburbs
of
towns
and
open
sunny
cultivated
places
in
brazil
are
tenanted
by
species
of
animals
and
plants
which
are
mostly
different
from
those
of
the
dense
primaeval
forests
i
will
therefore
give
an
account
of
what
we
observed
of
the
animal
world
during
our
explorations
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
para
the
number
and
beauty
of
the
birds
and
insects
did
not
at
first
equal
our
expectations
the
majority
of
the
birds
we
saw
were
small
and
obscurely
coloured
they
were
indeed
similar
in
general
appearance
to
such
as
are
met
with
in
country
places
in
england
occasionally
a
flock
of
small
parroquets
green
with
a
patch
of
yellow
on
the
forehead
would
come
at
early
morning
to
the
trees
near
the
estrada
they
would
feed
quietly
sometimes
chattering
in
subdued
tones
but
setting
up
a
harsh
scream
and
flying
off
on
being
disturbed
hummingbirds
we
did
not
see
at
this
time
although
i
afterwards
found
them
by
hundreds
when
certain
trees
were
in
flower
vultures
we
only
saw
at
a
distance
sweeping
round
at
a
great
height
over
the
public
houses
several
flycatchers
finches
a
tribe
of
birds
intermediate
in
structure
between
flycatchers
and
thrushes
some
of
which
startle
the
by
their
extraordinary
notes
emitted
from
their
places
of
concealment
in
the
dense
thickets
and
also
tanagers
and
other
small
birds
inhabited
the
neighbourhood
none
of
these
had
a
pleasing
song
except
a
little
brown
wren
troglodytes
furvus
whose
voice
and
melody
resemble
those
of
our
english
robin
it
is
often
seen
hopping
and
climbing
about
the
walls
and
roofs
of
houses
and
on
trees
in
their
vicinity
its
song
is
more
frequently
heard
in
the
rainy
season
when
the
monguba
trees
shed
their
leaves
at
those
times
the
estrada
das
mongubeiras
has
an
appearance
quite
unusual
in
a
tropical
country
the
tree
is
one
of
the
few
in
the
amazon
region
which
sheds
all
its
foliage
before
any
of
the
new
expand
the
naked
branches
the
sodden
ground
matted
with
dead
leaves
the
grey
mist
veiling
the
surrounding
vegetation
and
the
cool
atmosphere
soon
after
sunrise
all
combine
to
remind
one
of
autumnal
mornings
in
england
whilst
loitering
about
at
such
times
in
a
mood
thinking
of
home
the
song
of
this
bird
would
create
for
the
moment
a
perfect
illusion
numbers
of
tanagers
frequented
the
fruit
and
other
trees
in
our
garden
the
two
principal
kinds
which
attracted
our
attention
were
the
rhamphoccelus
jacapa
and
the
tanagra
episcopus
the
females
of
both
are
dull
in
colour
but
the
male
of
jacapa
has
a
beautiful
velvety
purple
and
black
plumage
the
beak
being
partly
white
whilst
the
same
sex
in
episcopus
is
of
a
pale
blue
colour
with
white
spots
on
the
wings
in
their
habits
they
both
resemble
the
common
sparrow
of
europe
which
does
not
exist
in
south
america
its
place
being
in
some
measure
filled
by
these
familiar
tanagers
they
are
just
as
lively
restless
bold
and
wary
their
notes
are
very
similar
chirping
and
inharmonious
and
they
seem
to
be
almost
as
fond
of
the
neighbourhood
of
man
they
do
not
however
build
their
nests
on
houses
another
interesting
and
common
bird
was
the
japim
a
species
of
cassicus
icteronotus
it
belongs
to
the
same
family
of
birds
as
our
starling
magpie
and
rook
it
has
a
rich
yellow
and
black
plumage
remarkably
compact
and
velvety
in
texture
the
shape
of
its
head
and
its
physiognomy
are
very
similar
to
those
of
the
magpie
it
has
light
grey
eyes
which
give
it
the
same
knowing
expression
it
is
social
in
its
habits
and
builds
its
nest
like
the
english
rook
on
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
of
habitations
but
the
nests
are
quite
differently
constructed
being
shaped
like
purses
two
feet
in
length
and
suspended
from
the
slender
branches
all
around
the
tree
some
of
them
very
near
the
ground
the
entrance
is
on
the
side
near
the
bottom
of
the
nest
the
bird
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
brazilians
of
para
it
is
a
noisy
stirring
babbling
creature
passing
constantly
to
and
fro
chattering
to
its
comrades
and
is
very
ready
at
imitating
other
birds
especially
the
domestic
poultry
of
the
vicinity
there
was
at
one
time
a
weekly
newspaper
published
at
para
called
the
japim
the
name
being
chosen
i
suppose
on
account
of
the
babbling
propensities
of
the
bird
its
eggs
are
nearly
round
and
of
a
colour
speckled
with
brown
of
other
vertebrate
animals
we
saw
very
little
except
of
the
lizards
these
are
sure
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
newcomer
from
northern
europe
by
reason
of
their
strange
appearance
great
numbers
and
variety
the
species
which
are
seen
crawling
over
the
walls
of
buildings
in
the
city
are
different
from
those
found
in
the
forest
or
in
the
interior
of
houses
they
are
animals
with
colours
assimilated
to
those
of
the
dilapidated
stone
and
mud
walls
on
which
they
are
seen
the
house
lizards
belong
to
a
peculiar
family
the
geckos
and
are
found
even
in
the
chambers
most
frequently
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
to
which
they
cling
motionless
by
day
being
active
only
at
night
they
are
of
speckled
grey
or
ashy
colours
the
structure
of
their
feet
is
beautifully
adapted
for
clinging
to
and
running
over
smooth
surfaces
the
underside
of
their
toes
being
expanded
into
cushions
beneath
which
folds
of
skin
form
a
series
of
flexible
plates
by
means
of
this
apparatus
they
can
walk
or
run
across
a
smooth
ceiling
with
their
backs
downwards
the
plated
soles
by
quick
muscular
action
exhausting
and
admitting
air
alternately
the
geckos
are
very
repulsive
in
appearance
the
brazilians
give
them
the
name
of
osgas
and
firmly
believe
them
to
be
poisonous
they
are
however
harmless
creatures
those
found
in
houses
are
small
but
i
have
seen
others
of
great
size
in
crevices
of
tree
trunks
in
the
forest
sometimes
geckos
are
found
with
forked
tails
this
results
from
the
budding
of
a
rudimentary
tail
at
the
side
from
an
injury
done
to
the
member
a
slight
rap
will
cause
their
tails
to
snap
off
the
loss
being
afterwards
partially
repaired
by
a
new
growth
the
tails
of
lizards
seem
to
be
almost
useless
appendages
to
these
animals
i
used
often
to
amuse
myself
in
the
suburbs
whilst
resting
in
the
verandah
of
our
house
during
the
heat
of
by
watching
the
variegated
green
brown
and
yellow
they
would
come
nimbly
forward
and
commence
grubbing
with
their
forefeet
and
snouts
around
the
roots
of
herbage
searching
for
insect
larvae
on
the
slightest
alarm
they
would
scamper
off
their
tails
cocked
up
in
the
air
as
they
waddled
awkwardly
away
evidently
an
incumbrance
to
them
in
their
flight
next
to
the
birds
and
lizards
the
insects
of
the
suburbs
of
para
deserve
a
few
remarks
the
species
observed
in
the
weedy
and
open
places
as
already
remarked
were
generally
different
from
those
which
dwell
in
the
shades
of
the
forest
in
the
gardens
numbers
of
fine
showy
butterflies
were
seen
there
were
two
tailed
species
similar
in
colours
to
the
english
papilio
machaon
a
white
pieris
monuste
and
two
or
three
species
of
brimstone
and
orange
coloured
butterflies
which
do
not
belong
however
to
the
same
genus
as
our
english
species
in
weedy
places
a
beautiful
butterfly
with
spots
on
its
wings
was
common
the
junonia
lavinia
the
only
amazonian
species
which
is
at
all
nearly
related
to
our
vanessas
the
admiral
and
peacock
butterflies
one
day
we
made
our
first
acquaintance
with
two
of
the
most
beautiful
productions
of
nature
in
this
department
namely
the
helicopis
cupido
and
endymion
a
little
beyond
our
house
one
of
the
narrow
green
lanes
which
i
have
already
mentioned
diverged
from
the
monguba
avenue
and
led
between
enclosures
overrun
with
a
profusion
of
creeping
plants
and
glorious
flowers
down
to
a
moist
hollow
where
there
was
a
public
well
in
a
picturesque
nook
buried
in
a
grove
of
mucaja
palm
trees
on
the
tree
trunks
walls
and
palings
grew
a
great
quantity
of
climbing
pothos
plants
with
large
glossy
shaped
leaves
these
plants
were
the
resort
of
these
two
exquisite
species
and
we
captured
a
great
number
of
specimens
they
are
of
extremely
delicate
texture
the
wings
are
coloured
the
hind
pair
have
several
appendages
and
are
spangled
beneath
as
if
with
silver
their
flight
is
very
slow
and
feeble
they
seek
the
protected
of
the
leaves
and
in
repose
close
their
wings
over
the
back
so
as
to
expose
the
brilliantly
spotted
i
will
pass
over
the
many
other
orders
and
families
of
insects
and
proceed
at
once
to
the
ants
these
were
in
great
numbers
everywhere
but
i
will
mention
here
only
two
kinds
we
were
amazed
at
seeing
ants
an
inch
and
a
quarter
in
length
and
stout
in
proportion
marching
in
single
file
through
the
thickets
these
belonged
to
the
species
called
dinoponera
grandis
its
colonies
consist
of
a
small
number
of
individuals
and
are
established
about
the
roots
of
slender
trees
it
is
a
stinging
species
but
the
sting
is
not
so
severe
as
in
many
of
the
smaller
kinds
there
was
nothing
peculiar
or
attractive
in
the
habits
of
this
giant
among
the
ants
another
far
more
interesting
species
was
the
sauba
oecodoma
cephalotes
this
ant
is
seen
everywhere
about
the
suburbs
marching
to
and
fro
in
broad
columns
from
its
habit
of
despoiling
the
most
valuable
cultivated
trees
of
their
foliage
it
is
a
great
scourge
to
the
brazilians
in
some
districts
it
is
so
abundant
that
agriculture
is
almost
impossible
and
everywhere
complaints
are
heard
of
the
terrible
pest
the
workers
of
this
species
are
of
three
orders
and
vary
in
size
from
two
to
seven
lines
some
idea
of
them
may
be
obtained
from
the
accompanying
woodcut
the
true
of
a
colony
is
formed
by
the
order
of
workers
the
as
they
are
called
fig
i
the
two
other
kinds
whose
functions
as
we
shall
see
are
not
yet
properly
understood
have
enormously
swollen
and
massive
heads
in
one
fig
the
head
is
highly
polished
in
the
other
fig
it
is
opaque
and
hairy
the
vary
greatly
in
size
some
being
double
the
bulk
of
others
the
entire
body
is
of
very
solid
consistency
and
of
a
pale
colour
the
thorax
or
middle
segment
is
armed
with
three
pairs
of
sharp
spines
the
head
also
has
a
pair
of
similar
spines
proceeding
from
the
cheeks
behind
in
our
first
walks
we
were
puzzled
to
account
for
large
mounds
of
earth
of
a
different
colour
from
the
surrounding
soil
which
were
thrown
up
in
the
plantations
and
woods
some
of
them
were
very
extensive
being
forty
yards
in
circumference
but
not
more
than
two
feet
in
height
we
soon
ascertained
that
these
were
the
work
of
the
saubas
being
the
outworks
or
domes
which
overlie
and
protect
the
entrances
to
their
vast
subterranean
galleries
on
close
examination
i
found
the
earth
of
which
they
are
composed
to
consist
of
very
minute
granules
agglomerated
without
cement
and
forming
many
rows
of
little
ridges
and
turrets
the
difference
in
colour
from
the
superficial
soil
of
the
vicinity
is
owing
to
their
being
formed
of
the
undersoil
brought
up
from
a
considerable
depth
it
is
very
rarely
that
the
ants
are
seen
at
work
on
these
mounds
the
entrances
seem
to
be
generally
closed
only
now
and
then
when
some
particular
work
is
going
on
are
the
galleries
opened
the
entrances
are
small
and
numerous
in
the
larger
hillocks
it
would
require
a
great
amount
of
excavation
to
get
at
the
main
galleries
but
i
succeeded
in
removing
portions
of
the
dome
in
smaller
hillocks
and
then
i
found
that
the
minor
entrances
converged
at
the
depth
of
about
two
feet
into
one
broad
gallery
or
mine
which
was
four
or
five
inches
in
diameter
this
habit
of
the
sauba
ant
of
clipping
and
carrying
away
immense
quantities
of
leaves
has
long
been
recorded
in
books
on
natural
history
when
employed
on
this
work
their
processions
look
like
a
multitude
of
animated
leaves
on
the
march
in
some
places
i
found
an
accumulation
of
such
leaves
all
circular
pieces
about
the
size
of
a
sixpence
lying
on
the
pathway
unattended
by
ants
and
at
some
distance
from
any
colony
such
heaps
are
always
found
to
be
removed
when
the
place
is
revisited
the
next
day
in
course
of
time
i
had
plenty
of
opportunities
of
seeing
them
at
work
they
mount
the
tree
in
multitudes
the
individuals
being
all
each
one
places
itself
on
the
surface
of
a
leaf
and
cuts
with
its
sharp
jaws
a
nearly
semicircular
incision
on
the
upper
side
it
then
takes
the
edge
between
its
jaws
and
by
a
sharp
jerk
detaches
the
piece
sometimes
they
let
the
leaf
drop
to
the
ground
where
a
little
heap
accumulates
until
carried
off
by
another
relay
of
workers
but
generally
each
marches
off
with
the
piece
it
has
operated
upon
and
as
all
take
the
same
road
to
their
colony
the
path
they
follow
becomes
in
a
short
time
smooth
and
bare
looking
like
the
impression
of
a
cartwheel
through
the
herbage
it
is
a
most
interesting
sight
to
see
the
vast
host
of
busy
diminutive
labourers
occupied
on
this
work
unfortunately
they
choose
cultivated
trees
for
their
purpose
this
ant
is
quite
peculiar
to
tropical
america
as
is
the
entire
genus
to
which
it
belongs
it
sometimes
despoils
the
young
trees
of
species
growing
wild
in
its
native
forests
but
seems
to
prefer
when
within
reach
plants
imported
from
other
countries
such
as
the
coffee
and
orange
trees
it
has
not
hitherto
been
shown
satisfactorily
to
what
use
it
applies
the
leaves
i
discovered
this
only
after
much
time
spent
in
investigation
the
leaves
are
used
to
thatch
the
domes
which
cover
the
entrances
to
their
subterranean
dwellings
thereby
protecting
from
the
deluging
rains
the
young
broods
in
the
nests
beneath
the
larger
mounds
already
described
are
so
extensive
that
few
persons
would
attempt
to
remove
them
for
the
purpose
of
examining
their
interior
but
smaller
hillocks
covering
other
entrances
to
the
same
system
of
tunnels
and
chambers
may
be
found
in
sheltered
places
and
these
are
always
thatched
with
leaves
mingled
with
granules
of
earth
the
workers
each
carrying
its
segment
of
leaf
vertically
the
lower
edge
secured
in
its
mandibles
troop
up
and
cast
their
burdens
on
the
hillock
another
relay
of
labourers
place
the
leaves
in
position
covering
them
with
a
layer
of
earthy
granules
which
are
brought
one
by
one
from
the
soil
beneath
the
underground
abodes
of
this
wonderful
ant
are
known
to
be
very
extensive
the
rev
hamlet
clark
has
related
that
the
sauba
of
rio
de
janeiro
a
species
closely
allied
to
ours
has
excavated
a
tunnel
under
the
bed
of
the
river
parahyba
at
a
place
where
it
is
broad
as
the
thames
at
london
bridge
at
the
magoary
rice
mills
near
para
these
ants
once
pierced
the
embankment
of
a
large
reservoir
the
great
body
of
water
which
it
contained
escaped
before
the
damage
could
be
repaired
in
the
botanic
gardens
at
para
an
enterprising
french
gardener
tried
all
he
could
think
of
to
extirpate
the
sauba
with
this
object
he
made
fires
over
some
of
the
main
entrances
to
their
colonies
and
blew
the
fumes
of
sulphur
down
the
galleries
by
means
of
bellows
i
saw
the
smoke
issue
from
a
great
number
of
outlets
one
of
which
was
seventy
yards
distant
from
the
place
where
the
bellows
were
used
this
shows
how
extensively
the
underground
galleries
are
ramified
besides
injuring
and
destroying
young
trees
by
despoiling
them
of
their
foliage
the
sauba
ant
is
troublesome
to
the
inhabitants
from
its
habit
of
plundering
the
stores
of
provisions
in
houses
at
night
for
it
is
even
more
active
by
night
than
in
the
time
at
first
i
was
inclined
to
discredit
the
stories
of
their
entering
habitations
and
carrying
off
grain
by
grain
the
farinha
or
mandioca
meal
the
bread
of
the
poorer
classes
of
brazil
at
length
whilst
residing
at
an
indian
village
on
the
tapajos
i
had
ample
proof
of
the
fact
one
night
my
servant
woke
me
three
or
four
hours
before
sunrise
by
calling
out
that
the
rats
were
robbing
the
farinha
baskets
the
article
at
that
time
being
scarce
and
dear
i
got
up
listened
and
found
the
noise
was
very
unlike
that
made
by
rats
so
i
took
the
light
and
went
into
the
storeroom
which
was
close
to
my
i
there
found
a
broad
column
of
sauba
ants
consisting
of
thousands
of
individuals
as
busy
as
possible
passing
to
and
fro
between
the
door
and
my
precious
baskets
most
of
those
passing
outwards
were
laden
each
with
a
grain
of
farinha
which
was
in
some
cases
larger
and
many
times
heavier
than
the
bodies
of
the
carriers
farinha
consists
of
grains
of
similar
size
and
appearance
to
the
tapioca
of
our
shops
both
are
products
of
the
same
root
tapioca
being
the
pure
starch
and
farinha
the
starch
mixed
with
woody
fibre
the
latter
ingredient
giving
it
a
yellowish
colour
it
was
amusing
to
see
some
of
the
dwarfs
the
smallest
members
of
their
family
staggering
along
completely
hidden
under
their
load
the
baskets
which
were
on
a
high
table
were
entirely
covered
with
ants
many
hundreds
of
whom
were
employed
in
snipping
the
dry
leaves
which
served
as
lining
this
produced
the
rustling
sound
which
had
at
first
disturbed
us
my
servant
told
me
that
they
would
carry
off
the
whole
contents
of
the
two
baskets
about
two
bushels
in
the
course
of
the
night
if
they
were
not
driven
off
so
we
tried
to
exterminate
them
by
killing
them
with
our
wooden
clogs
it
was
impossible
however
to
prevent
fresh
hosts
coming
in
as
fast
as
we
killed
their
companions
they
returned
the
next
night
and
i
was
then
obliged
to
lay
trains
of
gunpowder
along
their
line
and
blow
them
up
this
repeated
many
times
at
last
seemed
to
intimidate
them
for
we
were
free
from
their
visits
during
the
remainder
of
my
residence
at
the
place
what
they
did
with
the
hard
dry
grains
of
mandioca
i
was
never
able
to
ascertain
and
can
not
even
conjecture
the
meal
contains
no
gluten
and
therefore
would
be
useless
as
cement
it
contains
only
a
smallrelative
portion
of
starch
and
when
mixed
with
water
it
separates
and
falls
away
like
so
much
earthy
matter
it
may
serve
as
food
for
the
subterranean
workers
but
the
young
or
larvae
of
ants
are
usually
fed
by
juices
secreted
by
the
worker
nurses
ants
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
observe
consist
in
each
species
of
three
sets
of
individuals
or
as
some
express
it
of
three
sexes
namely
males
females
and
workers
the
mentioned
being
undeveloped
females
the
perfect
sexes
are
winged
on
their
first
attaining
the
adult
state
they
alone
propagate
their
kind
flying
away
previous
to
the
act
of
reproduction
from
the
nest
in
which
they
have
been
reared
this
winged
state
of
the
perfect
males
and
females
and
the
habit
of
flying
abroad
before
pairing
are
very
important
points
in
the
economy
of
ants
for
they
are
thus
enabled
to
intercross
with
members
of
distant
colonies
which
swarm
at
the
same
time
and
thereby
increase
the
vigour
of
the
race
a
proceeding
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
any
species
in
many
ants
especially
those
of
tropical
climates
the
workers
again
are
of
two
classes
whose
structure
and
functions
are
widely
different
in
some
species
they
are
wonderfully
unlike
each
other
and
constitute
two
forms
of
workers
in
others
there
is
a
gradation
of
individuals
between
the
two
extremes
the
curious
differences
in
structure
and
habits
between
these
two
classes
form
an
interesting
but
very
difficult
study
it
is
one
of
the
great
peculiarities
of
the
sauba
ant
to
possess
three
classes
of
workers
my
investigations
regarding
them
were
far
from
complete
i
will
relate
however
what
i
have
observed
on
the
subject
when
engaged
in
plundering
farinha
and
other
operations
two
classes
of
workers
are
always
seen
figs
and
page
they
are
not
it
is
true
very
sharply
defined
in
structure
for
individuals
of
intermediate
grades
occur
all
the
work
however
is
done
by
the
individuals
which
have
small
heads
fig
while
those
which
have
enormously
large
heads
the
fig
are
observed
to
be
simply
walking
about
i
could
never
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
function
of
these
majors
they
are
not
the
soldiers
or
defenders
of
the
working
portion
of
the
community
like
the
armed
class
in
the
termites
or
white
ants
for
they
never
fight
the
species
has
no
sting
and
does
not
display
active
resistance
when
interfered
with
i
once
imagined
they
exercised
a
sort
of
superintendence
over
the
others
but
this
function
is
entirely
unnecessary
in
a
community
where
all
work
with
a
precision
and
regularity
resembling
the
subordinate
parts
of
a
piece
of
machinery
i
came
to
the
conclusion
at
last
that
they
have
no
very
precisely
defined
function
they
can
not
however
be
entirely
useless
to
the
community
for
the
sustenance
of
an
idle
class
of
such
bulky
individuals
would
be
too
heavy
a
charge
for
the
species
to
sustain
i
think
they
serve
in
some
sort
as
passive
instruments
of
protection
to
the
real
workers
their
enormously
large
hard
and
indestructible
heads
may
be
of
use
in
protecting
them
against
the
attacks
of
insectivorous
animals
they
would
be
on
this
view
a
kind
of
pieces
de
resistance
serving
as
a
foil
against
onslaughts
made
on
the
main
body
of
workers
the
third
order
of
workers
is
the
most
curious
of
all
if
the
top
of
a
small
fresh
hillock
one
in
which
the
thatching
process
is
going
on
is
taken
off
a
broad
cylindrical
shaft
is
disclosed
at
a
depth
of
about
two
feet
from
the
surface
if
this
is
probed
with
a
stick
which
may
be
done
to
the
extent
of
three
or
four
feet
without
touching
bottom
a
small
number
of
colossal
fellows
fig
will
slowly
begin
to
make
their
way
up
the
smooth
sides
of
the
mine
their
heads
are
of
the
same
size
as
those
of
the
class
fig
but
the
front
is
clothed
with
hairs
instead
of
being
polished
and
they
have
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
a
twin
ocellus
or
simple
eye
of
quite
different
structure
from
the
ordinary
compound
eyes
on
the
sides
of
the
head
this
frontal
eye
is
totally
wanting
in
the
other
workers
and
is
not
known
in
any
other
kind
of
ant
the
apparition
of
these
strange
creatures
from
the
cavernous
depths
of
the
mine
reminded
me
when
i
first
observed
them
of
the
cyclopes
of
homeric
fable
they
were
not
very
pugnacious
as
i
feared
they
would
be
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
securing
a
few
with
my
fingers
i
never
saw
them
under
any
other
circumstances
than
those
here
related
and
what
their
special
functions
may
be
i
can
not
divine
the
whole
arrangement
of
a
formicarium
or
and
all
the
varied
activity
of
are
directed
to
one
main
purpose
the
perpetuation
and
dissemination
of
the
species
most
of
the
labour
which
we
see
performed
by
the
workers
has
for
its
end
the
sustenance
and
welfare
of
the
young
brood
which
are
helpless
grubs
the
true
females
are
incapable
of
attending
to
the
wants
of
their
offspring
and
it
is
on
the
poor
sterile
workers
who
are
denied
all
the
other
pleasures
of
maternity
that
the
entire
care
devolves
the
workers
are
also
the
chief
agents
in
carrying
out
the
different
migrations
of
the
colonies
which
are
of
vast
importance
to
the
dispersal
and
consequent
prosperity
of
the
species
the
successful
debut
of
the
winged
males
and
females
depends
likewise
on
the
workers
it
is
amusing
to
see
the
activity
and
excitement
which
reigns
in
an
ant
nest
when
the
exodus
of
the
winged
individuals
is
taking
place
the
workers
clear
the
roads
of
exit
and
show
the
most
lively
interest
in
their
departure
although
it
is
highly
improbable
that
any
of
them
will
return
to
the
same
colony
the
swarming
or
exodus
of
the
winged
males
and
females
of
the
sauba
ant
takes
place
in
january
and
february
that
is
at
the
commencement
of
the
rainy
season
they
come
out
in
the
evening
in
vast
numbers
causing
quite
a
commotion
in
the
streets
and
lanes
they
are
of
very
large
size
the
female
measuring
no
less
than
quarter
inches
in
expanse
of
wing
the
male
is
not
much
more
than
half
this
size
they
are
so
eagerly
preyed
upon
by
insectivorous
animals
that
on
the
morning
after
their
flight
not
an
individual
is
to
be
seen
a
few
impregnated
females
alone
escaping
the
slaughter
to
found
new
colonies
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
para
had
not
quite
recovered
from
the
effects
of
a
series
of
revolutions
brought
about
by
the
hatred
which
existed
between
the
native
brazilians
and
the
portuguese
the
former
in
the
end
calling
to
their
aid
the
indian
and
mixed
coloured
population
the
number
of
inhabitants
of
the
city
had
decreased
in
consequence
of
these
disorders
from
in
to
in
although
the
public
peace
had
not
been
broken
for
twelve
years
before
the
date
of
our
visit
confidence
was
not
yet
completely
restored
and
the
portuguese
merchants
and
tradesmen
would
not
trust
themselves
to
live
at
their
beautiful
country
houses
or
rocinhas
which
lie
embosomed
in
the
luxuriant
shady
gardens
around
the
city
no
progress
had
been
made
in
clearing
the
forest
which
had
grown
over
the
once
cultivated
grounds
and
now
reached
the
end
of
all
the
suburban
streets
the
place
had
the
aspect
of
one
which
had
seen
better
days
the
public
buildings
including
the
palaces
of
the
president
and
bishop
the
cathedral
the
principal
churches
and
convents
all
seemed
constructed
on
a
scale
of
grandeur
far
beyond
the
present
requirements
of
the
city
streets
full
of
extensive
private
residences
built
in
the
italian
style
of
architecture
were
in
a
neglected
condition
weeds
and
flourishing
young
trees
growing
from
large
cracks
in
the
masonry
the
large
public
squares
were
overgrown
with
weeds
and
impassable
on
account
of
the
swampy
places
which
occupied
portions
of
their
areas
commerce
however
was
now
beginning
to
revive
and
before
i
left
the
country
i
saw
great
improvements
as
i
shall
have
to
relate
towards
the
conclusion
of
this
narrative
the
province
of
which
para
is
the
capital
was
at
the
time
i
allude
to
the
most
extensive
in
the
brazilian
empire
being
about
miles
in
length
from
east
to
west
and
about
in
breadth
since
that
date
namely
in
it
has
been
divided
into
two
by
the
separation
of
the
upper
amazons
as
a
distinct
province
it
formerly
constituted
a
section
capitania
or
governorship
of
the
portuguese
colony
originally
it
was
well
peopled
by
indians
varying
much
in
social
condition
according
to
their
tribe
but
all
exhibiting
the
same
general
physical
characters
which
are
those
of
the
american
red
man
somewhat
modified
by
long
residence
in
an
equatorial
forest
country
most
of
the
tribes
are
now
extinct
or
forgotten
at
least
those
which
originally
peopled
the
banks
of
the
main
river
their
descendants
having
amalgamated
with
the
white
and
negro
immigrants
the
mixed
breeds
which
now
form
probably
the
greater
part
of
the
population
each
have
a
distinguishing
name
mameluco
denotes
the
offspring
of
white
with
indian
mulatto
that
of
white
with
negro
cafuzo
the
mixture
of
the
indian
and
negro
curiboco
the
cross
between
the
cafuzo
and
the
indian
xibaro
that
between
the
cafuzo
and
negro
these
are
seldom
however
and
all
shades
of
colour
exist
the
names
are
generally
applied
only
approximatively
the
term
creole
is
confined
to
negroes
born
in
the
country
the
civilised
indian
is
called
tapuyo
or
caboclo
many
still
exist
however
in
their
original
state
on
the
upper
amazons
and
most
of
the
branch
rivers
on
this
account
indians
in
this
province
are
far
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
in
brazil
and
the
indian
element
may
be
said
to
prevail
in
the
mongrel
population
the
negro
proportion
being
much
smaller
than
in
south
brazil
the
city
is
built
on
the
best
available
site
for
a
port
of
entry
to
the
amazons
region
and
must
in
time
become
a
vast
emporium
the
northern
shore
of
the
main
river
where
alone
a
rival
capital
could
be
founded
is
much
more
difficult
of
access
to
vessels
and
is
besides
extremely
unhealthy
although
lying
so
near
the
equator
s
lat
the
climate
is
not
excessively
hot
the
temperature
during
three
years
only
once
reached
degrees
fahrenheit
the
greatest
heat
of
the
day
about
ranges
generally
between
and
but
on
the
other
hand
the
air
is
never
cooler
than
so
that
a
uniformly
high
temperature
exists
and
the
mean
of
the
year
is
north
american
residents
say
that
the
heat
is
not
so
oppressive
as
it
is
in
summer
in
new
york
and
philadelphia
the
humidity
is
of
course
excessive
but
the
rains
are
not
so
heavy
and
continuous
in
the
wet
season
as
in
many
other
tropical
climates
the
country
had
for
a
long
time
a
reputation
for
extreme
salubrity
since
the
in
which
attacked
chiefly
the
indians
no
serious
epidemic
had
visited
the
province
we
were
agreeably
surprised
to
find
no
danger
from
exposure
to
the
night
air
or
residence
in
the
low
swampy
lands
a
few
english
residents
who
had
been
established
here
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
looked
almost
as
fresh
in
colour
as
if
they
had
never
left
their
native
country
the
native
women
too
seemed
to
preserve
their
good
looks
and
plump
condition
until
late
in
life
i
nowhere
observed
that
early
decay
of
appearance
in
brazilian
ladies
which
is
said
to
be
so
general
in
the
women
of
north
america
up
to
the
salubrity
of
para
was
quite
remarkable
for
a
city
lying
in
the
delta
of
a
great
river
in
the
middle
of
the
tropics
and
half
surrounded
by
swamps
it
did
not
much
longer
enjoy
its
immunity
from
epidemics
in
the
yellow
fever
visited
the
province
for
the
first
time
and
carried
off
in
a
few
weeks
more
than
four
percent
of
the
population
one
disease
after
another
succeeded
until
in
cholera
swept
through
the
country
and
caused
fearful
havoc
since
then
the
healthfulness
of
the
climate
has
been
gradually
restored
and
it
is
now
fast
recovering
its
former
good
reputation
para
is
free
from
serious
endemic
disorders
and
was
once
a
resort
of
invalids
from
new
york
and
massachusetts
the
equable
temperature
the
perpetual
verdure
the
coolness
of
the
dry
season
when
the
sun
heat
is
tempered
by
the
strong
and
the
moderation
of
the
periodical
rains
make
the
climate
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
province
is
governed
like
all
others
in
the
empire
by
a
president
as
chief
civil
authority
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
he
also
held
exceptionally
the
chief
military
command
this
functionary

with
the

of
the
police
administration
and
the
judges

nominated
by
the
central
government
at

the

altogether
the

seems
to
combine
happily
the

and

in

to

to

prosperity
the
province
of
para
or
as
we
may
now
say
the
two
provinces
of
para
and
the
amazons
contain
an
area
of
square
miles
the
population
of
which
is
only
about
or
in
the
ratio
of
one
person
to
four
square
miles
the
country
is
covered
with
forests
and
the
soil
is
fertile
in
the
extreme
even
for
a
tropical
country
it
is
intersected
throughout
by
broad
and
deep
navigable
rivers
it
is
the
pride
of
the
paraenses
to
call
the
amazons
the
mediterranean
of
south
america
the
colossal
stream
perhaps
deserves
the
name
for
not
only
have
the
main
river
and
its
principal
tributaries
an
immense
expanse
of
water
bathing
the
shores
of
extensive
and
varied
regions
but
there
is
also
throughout
a
system
of
back
channels
connected
with
the
main
rivers
by
narrow
outlets
and
linking
together
a
series
of
lakes
some
of
which
are
fifteen
twenty
and
thirty
miles
in
length
the
whole
amazons
valley
is
thus
covered
by
a
network
of
navigable
waters
forming
a
vast
inland
freshwater
sea
with
endless
ramifications
rather
than
a
river
the
city
of
para
was
founded
in
and
was
a
place
of
considerable
importance
towards
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
under
the
government
of
the
brother
of
pombal
the
famous
portuguese
statesman
the
province
was
the
last
in
brazil
to
declare
its
independence
of
the
and
acknowledge
the
authority
of
the
first
emperor
don
pedro
this
was
owing
to
the
great
numbers
and
influence
of
the
portuguese
and
the
rage
of
the
native
party
was
so
great
in
consequence
that
immediately
after
independence
was
proclaimed
in
a
counter
revolution
broke
out
during
which
many
hundred
lives
were
lost
and
much
hatred
engendered
the
antagonism
continued
for
many
years
partial
insurrections
taking
place
when
the
populace
thought
that
the
immigrants
from
portugal
were
favoured
by
the
governors
sent
from
the
capital
of
the
empire
at
length
in
a
serious
revolt
took
place
which
in
a
short
time
involved
the
entire
province
it
began
by
the
assassination
of
the
president
and
the
leading
members
of
the
government
the
struggle
was
severe
and
the
native
party
in
an
evil
hour
called
to
their
aid
the
ignorant
and
fanatic
part
of
the
mongrel
and
indian
population
the
cry
of
death
to
the
portuguese
was
soon
changed
to
death
to
the
freemasons
then
a
powerfully
organised
society
embracing
the
greater
part
of
the
male
white
inhabitants
the
victorious
native
party
endeavoured
to
establish
a
government
of
their
own
after
this
state
of
things
had
endured
six
months
they
accepted
a
new
president
sent
from
rio
janeiro
who
however
again
irritated
them
by
imprisoning
their
favourite
leader
vinagre
the
revenge
which
followed
was
frightful
a
vast
host
of
savage
coloured
people
assembled
in
the
retired
creeks
behind
para
and
on
a
day
fixed
after
vinagre
brother
had
sent
a
message
three
times
to
the
president
demanding
in
vain
the
release
of
their
leader
the
whole
body
poured
into
the
city
through
the
gloomy
pathways
of
the
forest
which
encircles
it
a
cruel
battle
lasting
nine
days
was
fought
in
the
streets
an
english
french
and
portuguese
from
the
side
of
the
river
assisting
the
legal
authorities
all
the
latter
however
together
with
every
friend
of
peace
and
order
were
finally
obliged
to
retire
to
an
island
a
few
miles
distant
the
city
and
province
were
given
up
to
anarchy
the
coloured
people
elated
with
victory
proclaimed
the
slaughter
of
all
whites
except
the
english
french
and
american
residents
the
mistaken
principals
who
had
first
aroused
all
this
hatred
of
races
were
obliged
now
to
make
their
escape
in
the
interior
the
supporters
of
lawful
authority
including
it
must
be
stated
whole
tribes
of
friendly
indians
and
numbers
of
the
better
disposed
negroes
and
mulattos
concentrated
themselves
in
certain
strong
positions
and
defended
themselves
until
the
reconquest
of
the
capital
and
large
towns
of
the
interior
in
by
a
force
sent
from
rio
janeiro
after
ten
months
of
anarchy
years
of
conciliatory
government
the
lesson
learned
by
the
native
party
and
the
moderation
of
the
portuguese
aided
by
the
indolence
and
passive
goodness
of
the
paraenses
of
all
classes
and
colours
were
only
beginning
to
produce
their
good
effects
about
the
time
i
am
speaking
of
life
however
was
now
and
had
been
for
some
time
quite
safe
throughout
the
country
some
few
of
the
worst
characters
had
been
transported
or
imprisoned
and
the
remainder
after
being
pardoned
were
converted
once
more
into
quiet
and
peaceable
citizens
i
resided
at
para
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
altogether
returning
thither
and
making
a
stay
of
a
few
months
after
each
of
my
shorter
excursions
into
the
interior
until
the
of
november
when
i
started
on
my
long
voyage
to
the
tapajos
and
the
upper
amazons
which
occupied
me
seven
years
and
a
half
i
became
during
this
time
tolerably
familiar
with
the
capital
of
the
amazons
region
and
its
inhabitants
compared
with
other
brazilian
seaport
towns
i
was
always
told
para
shone
to
great
advantage
it
was
cleaner
the
suburbs
were
fresher
more
rural
and
much
pleasanter
on
account
of
their
verdure
shade
and
magnificent
vegetation
the
people
were
simpler
more
peaceable
and
friendly
in
their
manners
and
dispositions
and
assassinations
which
give
the
southern
provinces
so
ill
a
reputation
were
almost
unknown
at
the
same
time
the
para
people
were
much
inferior
to
southern
brazilians
in
energy
and
industry
provisions
and
house
rents
being
cheap
and
the
wants
of
the
people
few
for
they
were
content
with
food
and
lodging
of
a
quality
which
would
be
spurned
by
paupers
in
england
they
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
time
in
sensual
indulgences
and
in
amusements
which
the
government
and
wealthier
citizens
provided
for
them
gratis
the
trade
wholesale
and
retail
was
in
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
of
whom
there
were
about
in
the
place
many
handicrafts
were
exercised
by
coloured
people
mulattos
mamelucos
free
negroes
and
indians
the
better
sort
of
brazilians
dislike
the
petty
details
of
and
if
they
can
not
be
wholesale
merchants
prefer
the
life
of
planters
in
the
country
however
small
may
be
the
estate
and
the
gains
the
negroes
constituted
the
class
of
and
porters
indians
were
universally
the
watermen
and
formed
the
crews
of
the
numberless
canoes
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
which
traded
between
para
and
the
interior
the
educated
brazilians
not
many
of
whom
are
of
pure
caucasian
descent
for
the
immigration
of
portuguese
for
many
years
has
been
almost
exclusively
of
the
male
sex
are
courteous
lively
and
intelligent
people
they
were
gradually
weaning
themselves
of
the
ignorant
bigoted
notions
which
they
inherited
from
their
portuguese
ancestors
especially
those
entertained
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
women
formerly
the
portuguese
would
not
allow
their
wives
to
go
into
society
or
their
daughters
to
learn
reading
and
writing
in
brazilian
ladies
were
only
just
beginning
to
emerge
from
this
inferior
position
and
brazilian
fathers
were
opening
their
eyes
to
the
advantages
of
education
for
their
daughters
reforms
of
this
kind
are
slow
it
is
perhaps
in
part
owing
to
the
degrading
position
always
held
by
women
that
the
relations
between
the
sexes
were
and
are
still
on
so
unsatisfactory
a
footing
and
private
morality
at
so
low
an
ebb
in
brazil
in
para
i
believe
that
an
improvement
is
now
taking
place
but
formerly
promiscuous
intercourse
seemed
to
be
the
general
rule
among
all
classes
and
intrigues
and
the
serious
business
of
the
greater
part
of
the
population
that
this
state
of
things
is
a
necessity
depending
on
the
climate
and
institutions
i
do
not
believe
as
i
have
resided
at
small
towns
in
the
interior
where
the
habits
and
the
general
standard
of
morality
of
the
inhabitants
were
as
pure
as
they
are
in
similar
places
in
england
chapter

para

life
of
a

under
the
equator
the
drier
virgin
forests
magoary
retired
creeks
aborigines
after
having
resided
about
a
fortnight
at
miller
rocinha
we
heard
of
another
similar
to
be
let
much
better
situated
for
our
purpose
in
the
village
of
nazareth
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
city
and
close
to
the
forest
the
owner
was
an
old
portuguese
gentleman
named
danin
who
lived
at
his
tile
manufactory
at
the
mouth
of
the
una
a
small
river
lying
two
miles
below
para
we
resolved
to
walk
to
his
place
through
the
forest
a
distance
of
three
miles
although
the
road
was
said
to
be
scarcely
passable
at
this
season
of
the
year
and
the
una
much
more
easily
accessible
by
boat
we
were
glad
however
of
this
early
opportunity
of
traversing
the
rich
swampy
forest
which
we
had
admired
so
much
from
the
deck
of
the
ship
so
about
eleven
one
sunny
morning
after
procuring
the
necessary
information
about
the
road
we
set
off
in
that
direction
this
part
of
the
forest
afterwards
became
one
of
my
best
grounds
i
will
narrate
the
incidents
of
the
walk
giving
my
first
impressions
and
some
remarks
on
the
wonderful
vegetation
the
forest
is
very
similar
on
most
of
the
low
lands
and
therefore
one
description
will
do
for
all
on
leaving
the
town
we
walked
along
a
straight
suburban
road
constructed
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
land
it
had
low
swampy
ground
on
each
side
built
upon
however
and
containing
several
spacious
rocinhas
which
were
embowered
in
magnificent
foliage
leaving
the
last
of
these
we
arrived
at
a
part
where
the
lofty
forest
towered
up
like
a
wall
five
or
six
yards
from
the
edge
of
the
path
to
the
height
of
probably
a
hundred
feet
the
tree
trunks
were
only
seen
partially
here
and
there
nearly
the
whole
frontage
from
ground
to
summit
being
covered
with
a
diversified
drapery
of
creeping
plants
all
of
the
most
vivid
shades
of
green
scarcely
a
flower
to
be
seen
except
in
some
places
a
solitary
scarlet
set
in
the
green
mantle
like
a
star
the
low
ground
on
the
borders
between
the
forest
wall
and
the
road
was
encumbered
with
a
tangled
mass
of
bushy
and
shrubby
vegetation
amongst
which
prickly
mimosas
were
very
numerous
covering
the
other
bushes
in
the
same
way
as
brambles
do
in
england
other
dwarf
mimosas
trailed
along
the
ground
close
to
the
edge
of
the
road
shrinking
at
the
slightest
touch
of
the
feet
as
we
passed
by
cassia
trees
with
their
elegant
pinnate
foliage
and
conspicuous
yellow
flowers
formed
a
great
proportion
of
the
lower
trees
and
arborescent
arums
grew
in
groups
around
the
swampy
hollows
over
the
whole
fluttered
a
larger
number
of
butterflies
than
we
had
yet
seen
some
wholly
orange
or
yellow
callidryas
others
with
excessively
elongated
wings
sailing
horizontally
through
the
air
coloured
black
and
varied
with
blue
red
and
yellow
heliconii
one
magnificent
species
colaenis
dido
especially
attracted
our
attention
near
the
ground
hovered
many
other
smaller
species
very
similar
in
appearance
to
those
found
at
home
attracted
by
the
flowers
of
numerous
leguminous
and
other
shrubs
besides
butterflies
there
were
few
other
insects
except
dragonflies
which
were
in
great
numbers
similar
in
shape
to
english
species
but
some
of
them
looking
conspicuously
different
on
account
of
their
fiery
red
colours
after
stopping
repeatedly
to
examine
and
admire
we
at
length
walked
onward
the
road
then
ascended
slightly
and
the
soil
and
vegetation
became
suddenly
altered
in
character
the
shrubs
here
were
grasses
low
sedges
and
other
plants
smaller
in
foliage
than
those
growing
in
moist
grounds
the
forest
was
second
growth
low
consisting
of
trees
which
had
the
general
aspect
of
laurels
and
other
evergreens
in
our
gardens
at
home
the
leaves
glossy
and
dark
green
some
of
them
were
elegantly
veined
and
hairy
melastomae
while
many
scattered
amongst
the
rest
had
smaller
foliage
myrtles
but
these
were
not
sufficient
to
subtract
much
from
the
general
character
of
the
whole
the
sun
now
for
we
had
loitered
long
on
the
road
was
exceedingly
powerful
the
day
was
most
brilliant
the
sky
without
a
cloud
in
fact
it
was
one
of
those
glorious
days
which
announce
the
commencement
of
the
dry
season
the
radiation
of
heat
from
the
sandy
ground
was
visible
by
the
quivering
motion
of
the
air
above
it
we
saw
or
heard
no
mammals
or
birds
a
few
cattle
belonging
to
an
estate
down
a
shady
lane
were
congregated
panting
under
a
cluster
of
wide
spreading
trees
the
very
soil
was
hot
to
our
feet
and
we
hastened
onward
to
the
shade
of
the
forest
which
we
could
see
not
far
ahead
at
length
on
entering
it
what
a
relief
we
found
ourselves
in
a
moderately
broad
pathway
or
alley
where
the
branches
of
the
trees
crossed
overhead
and
produced
a
delightful
shade
the
woods
were
at
first
of
recent
growth
dense
and
utterly
impenetrable
the
ground
instead
of
being
clothed
with
grass
and
shrubs
as
in
the
woods
of
europe
was
everywhere
carpeted
with
lycopodiums
mosses
gradually
the
scene
became
changed
we
descended
slightly
from
an
elevated
dry
and
sandy
area
to
a
low
and
swampy
one
a
cool
air
breathed
on
our
faces
and
a
mouldy
smell
of
rotting
vegetation
greeted
us
the
trees
were
now
taller
the
underwood
less
dense
and
we
could
obtain
glimpses
into
the
wilderness
on
all
sides
the
leafy
crowns
of
the
trees
scarcely
two
of
which
could
be
seen
together
of
the
same
kind
were
now
far
away
above
us
in
another
world
as
it
were
we
could
only
see
at
times
where
there
was
a
break
above
the
tracery
of
the
foliage
against
the
clear
blue
sky
sometimes
the
leaves
were
palmate
or
of
the
shape
of
large
outstretched
hands
at
others
finely
cut
or
feathery
like
the
leaves
of
mimosae
below
the
tree
trunks
were
everywhere
linked
together
by
sipos
the
woody
flexible
stems
of
climbing
and
creeping
trees
whose
foliage
is
far
away
above
mingled
with
that
of
the
taller
independent
trees
some
were
twisted
in
strands
like
cables
others
had
thick
stems
contorted
in
every
variety
of
shape
entwining
round
the
tree
trunks
or
forming
gigantic
loops
and
coils
among
the
larger
branches
others
again
were
of
zigzag
shape
or
indented
like
the
steps
of
a
staircase
sweeping
from
the
ground
to
a
giddy
height
it
interested
me
much
afterwards
to
find
that
these
climbing
trees
do
not
form
any
particular
family
there
is
no
distinct
group
of
plants
whose
special
habit
is
to
climb
but
species
of
many
and
the
most
diverse
families
the
bulk
of
whose
members
are
not
climbers
seem
to
have
been
driven
by
circumstances
to
adopt
this
habit
there
is
even
a
climbing
genus
of
palms
desmoncus
the
species
of
which
are
called
in
the
tupi

jacitara
these
have
slender
and
flexuous
stems
which
twine
about
the
taller
trees
from
one
to
the
other
and
grow
to
an
incredible
length
the
leaves
which
have
the
ordinary
pinnate
shape
characteristic
of
the
family
are
emitted
from
the
stems
at
long
intervals
instead
of
being
collected
into
a
dense
crown
and
have
at
their
tips
a
number
of
long
recurved
spines
these
structures
are
excellent
contrivances
to
enable
the
trees
to
secure
themselves
by
in
climbing
but
they
are
a
great
nuisance
to
the
traveller
for
they
sometimes
hang
over
the
pathway
and
catch
the
hat
or
clothes
dragging
off
the
one
or
tearing
the
other
as
he
passes
the
number
and
variety
of
climbing
trees
in
the
amazons
forests
are
interesting
taken
in
connection
with
the
fact
of
the
very
general
tendency
of
the
animals
also
to
become
climbers
all
the
amazonian
and
in
fact
all
south
american
monkeys
are
climbers
there
is
no
group
answering
to
the
baboons
of
the
old
world
which
live
on
the
ground
the
gallinaceous
birds
of
the
country
the
representatives
of
the
fowls
and
pheasants
of
asia
and
africa
are
all
adapted
by
the
position
of
the
toes
to
perch
on
trees
and
it
is
only
on
trees
at
a
great
height
that
they
are
to
be
seen
a
genus
of
plantigrade
carnivora
allied
to
the
bears
cercoleptes
found
only
in
the
amazonian
forests
is
entirely
arboreal
and
has
a
long
flexible
tail
like
that
of
certain
monkeys
many
other
similar
instances
could
be
enumerated
but
i
will
mention
only
the
geodephaga
or
carnivorous
ground
beetles
a
great
proportion
of
whose
genera
and
species
in
these
forest
regions
are
by
the
structure
of
their
feet
fitted
to
live
exclusively
on
the
branches
and
leaves
of
trees
many
of
the
woody
lianas
suspended
from
trees
are
not
climbers
but
the
of
epiphytous
plants
aroideae
which
sit
on
the
stronger
boughs
of
the
trees
above
and
hang
down
straight
as
some
are
suspended
singly
others
in
clusters
some
reach
halfway
to
the
ground
and
others
touch
it
striking
their
rootlets
into
the
earth
the
underwood
in
this
part
of
the
forest
was
composed
partly
of
younger
trees
of
the
same
species
as
their
taller
neighbours
and
partly
of
palms
of
many
species
some
of
them
twenty
to
thirty
feet
in
height
others
small
and
delicate
with
stems
no
thicker
than
a
finger
these
latter
different
kinds
of
bactris
bore
small
bunches
of
fruit
red
or
black
often
containing
a
sweet
juice
further
on
the
ground
became
more
swampy
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
picking
our
way
the
wild
banana
urania
amazonica
here
began
to
appear
and
as
it
grew
in
masses
imparted
a
new
aspect
to
the
scene
the
leaves
of
this
beautiful
plant
are
like
blades
eight
feet
in
length
and
a
foot
broad
they
rise
straight
upwards
alternately
from
the
top
of
a
stem
five
or
six
feet
high
numerous
kinds
of
plants
with
leaves
similar
in
shape
to
these
but
smaller
clothed
the
ground
amongst
them
were
species
of
marantaceae
some
of
which
had
broad
glossy
leaves
with
long
radiating
from
joints
in
a
stem
the
trunks
of
the
trees
were
clothed
with
climbing
ferns
and
pothos
plants
with
large
fleshy
leaves
bamboos
and
other
tall
grass
and
plants
arched
over
the
pathway
the
appearance
of
this
part
of
the
forest
was
strange
in
the
extreme
description
can
convey
no
adequate
idea
of
it
the
reader
who
has
visited
kew
may
form
some
notion
by
conceiving
a
vegetation
like
that
in
the
great
spread
over
a
large
tract
of
swampy
ground
but
he
must
fancy
it
mingled
with
large
exogenous
trees
similar
to
our
oaks
and
elms
covered
with
creepers
and
parasites
and
figure
to
himself
the
ground
encumbered
with
fallen
and
rotting
trunks
branches
and
leaves
the
whole
illuminated
by
a
glowing
vertical
sun
and
reeking
with
moisture
at
length
we
emerged
from
the
forest
on
the
banks
of
the
una
near
its
mouth
it
was
here
about
one
hundred
yards
wide
the
residence
of
senor
danin
stood
on
the
opposite
shore
a
large
building
whitewashed
and
as
usual
raised
on
wooden
piles
above
the
humid
ground
the
second
story
was
the
part
occupied
by
the
family
and
along
it
was
an
open
verandah
where
people
both
male
and
female
were
at
work
below
were
several
negroes
employed
carrying
clay
on
their
heads
we
called
out
for
a
boat
and
one
of
them
crossed
over
to
fetch
us
senor
danin
received
us
with
the
usual
formal
politeness
of
the
portuguese
he
spoke
english
very
well
and
after
we
had
arranged
our
business
we
remained
conversing
with
him
on
various
subjects
connected
with
the
country
like
all
employers
in
this
province
he
was
full
of
one
topic
the
scarcity
of
hands
it
appeared
that
he
had
made
great
exertions
to
introduce
white
labour
but
had
failed
after
having
brought
numbers
of
men
from
portugal
and
other
countries
under
engagement
to
work
for
him
they
all
left
him
one
by
one
soon
after
their
arrival
the
abundance
of
unoccupied
land
the
liberty
that
exists
a
state
of
things
produced
by
the
of
the
people
and
the
case
with
which
a
mere
subsistence
can
be
obtained
with
moderate
work
tempt
even
the
to
quit
regular
labour
as
soon
as
they
can
he
complained
also
of
the
dearness
of
slaves
owing
to
the
prohibition
of
the
african
traffic
telling
us
that
formerly
a
slave
could
be
bought
for
dollars
whereas
they
are
now
difficult
to
procure
at
dollars
danin
told
us
that
he
had
travelled
in
england
and
the
united
states
and
that
he
had
now
two
sons
completing
their
education
in
those
countries
i
afterwards
met
with
many
enterprising
persons
of
danin
order
both
brazilians
and
portuguese
their
great
ambition
is
to
make
a
voyage
to
europe
or
north
america
and
to
send
their
sons
to
be
educated
there
the
land
on
which
his
establishment
is
built
he
told
us
was
an
artificial
embankment
on
the
swamp
the
end
of
the
house
was
built
on
a
projecting
point
overlooking
the
river
so
that
a
good
view
was
obtained
from
the
of
the
city
and
the
shipping
we
learned
there
was
formerly
a
large
and
flourishing
cattle
estate
on
this
spot
with
an
open
grassy
space
like
a
park
on
sundays
gay
parties
of
forty
or
fifty
persons
used
to
come
by
land
and
water
in
carriages
and
gay
galliotas
to
spend
the
day
with
the
hospitable
owner
since
the
political
disorders
which
i
have
already
mentioned
decay
had
come
upon
this
as
on
most
other
large
establishments
in
the
country
the
cultivated
grounds
and
the
roads
leading
to
them
were
now
entirely
overgrown
with
dense
forest
when
we
were
ready
to
depart
senor
danin
lent
a
canoe
and
two
negroes
to
take
us
to
the
city
where
we
arrived
in
the
evening
after
a
day
rich
in
new
experiences
shortly
afterwards
we
took
possession
of
our
new
residence
the
house
was
a
square
building
consisting
of
four
rooms
the
tiled
roof
projected
all
round
so
as
to
form
a
broad
verandah
cool
and
pleasant
to
sit
and
work
in
the
cultivated
ground
which
appeared
as
if
newly
cleared
from
the
forest
was
planted
with
fruit
trees
and
small
plots
of
coffee
and
mandioca
the
entrance
to
the
grounds
was
by
an
gateway
from
a
grassy
square
around
which
were
built
the
few
houses
and
thatched
huts
which
then
constituted
the
village
the
most
important
building
was
the
chapel
of
our
lady
of
nazareth
which
stood
opposite
our
place
the
saint
here
enshrined
was
a
great
favourite
with
all
orthodox
paraenses
who
attributed
to
her
the
performance
of
many
miracles
the
image
was
to
be
seen
on
the
altar
a
handsome
doll
about
four
feet
high
wearing
a
silver
crown
and
a
garment
of
blue
silk
studded
with
golden
stars
in
and
about
the
chapel
were
the
offerings
that
had
been
made
to
her
proofs
of
the
miracles
which
she
had
performed
there
were
models
of
legs
arms
breasts
and
so
forth
which
she
had
cured
but
most
curious
of
all
was
a
ship
boat
deposited
here
by
the
crew
of
a
portuguese
vessel
which
had
foundered
a
year
or
two
before
our
arrival
in
a
squall
off
cayenne
part
of
them
having
been
saved
in
the
boat
after
invoking
the
protection
of
the
saint
here
enshrined
the
annual
festival
in
honour
of
our
lady
of
nazareth
is
the
greatest
of
the
para
holidays
many
persons
come
to
it
from
the
neighbouring
city
of
maranham
miles
distant
once
the
president
ordered
the
mail
steamer
to
be
delayed
two
days
at
para
for
the
convenience
of
these
visitors
the
popularity
of
the
festival
is
partly
owing
to
the
beautiful
weather
that
prevails
when
it
takes
place
namely
in
the
middle
of
the
fine
season
on
the
ten
days
preceding
the
full
moon
in
october
or
november
para
is
then
seen
at
its
best
the
weather
is
not
too
dry
for
three
weeks
never
follow
in
succession
without
a
shower
so
that
all
the
glory
of
verdure
and
flowers
can
be
enjoyed
with
clear
skies
the
moonlit
nights
are
then
especially
beautiful
the
atmosphere
is
transparently
clear
and
the
light
produces
an
agreeable
coolness
we
now
settled
ourselves
for
a
few
months
regular
work
we
had
the
forest
on
three
sides
of
us
it
was
the
end
of
the
wet
season
most
species
of
birds
had
finished
moulting
and
every
day
the
insects
increased
in
number
and
variety
behind
the
rocinha
after
several
days
exploration
i
found
a
series
of
pathways
through
the
woods
which
led
to
the
una
road
about
half
way
was
the
house
in
which
the
celebrated
travellers
spix
and
martius
resided
during
their
stay
at
para
in
it
was
now
in
a
neglected
condition
and
the
plantations
were
overgrown
with
bushes
the
paths
hereabout
were
very
productive
of
insects
and
being
entirely
under
shade
were
very
pleasant
for
strolling
close
to
our
doors
began
the
main
forest
road
it
was
broad
enough
for
two
horsemen
abreast
and
branched
off
in
three
directions
the
main
line
going
to
the
village
of
ourem
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
this
road
formerly
extended
to
maranham
but
it
had
been
long
in
disuse
and
was
now
grown
up
being
scarcely
passable
between
para
and
ourem
our
researches
were
made
in
various
directions
along
these
paths
and
every
day
produced
us
a
number
of
new
and
interesting
species
collecting
preparing
our
specimens
and
making
notes
kept
us
well
occupied
one
day
was
so
much
like
another
that
a
general
description
of
the
diurnal
round
of
incidents
including
the
sequence
of
natural
phenomena
will
be
sufficient
to
give
an
idea
of
how
days
pass
to
naturalists
under
the
equator
we
used
to
rise
soon
after
dawn
when
isidoro
would
go
down
to
the
city
after
supplying
us
with
a
cup
of
coffee
to
purchase
the
fresh
provisions
for
the
day
the
two
hours
before
breakfast
were
devoted
to
ornithology
at
that
early
period
of
the
day
the
sky
was
invariably
cloudless
the
thermometer
marking
or
fahr
the
heavy
dew
or
the
previous
night
rain
which
lay
on
the
moist
foliage
becoming
quickly
dissipated
by
the
glowing
sun
which
rising
straight
out
of
the
east
mounted
rapidly
towards
the
zenith
all
nature
was
fresh
new
leaf
and
buds
expanding
rapidly
some
mornings
a
single
tree
would
appear
in
flower
amidst
what
was
the
preceding
evening
a
uniform
green
mass
of
forest
a
dome
of
blossom
suddenly
created
as
if
by
magic
the
birds
were
all
active
from
the
trees
not
far
off
we
often
heard
the
shrill
yelping
of
the
toucans
ramphastos
vitellinus
small
flocks
of
parrots
flew
over
on
most
mornings
at
a
great
height
appearing
in
distinct
relief
against
the
blue
sky
always
chattering
to
each
other
the
pairs
being
separated
by
regular
intervals
their
bright
colours
however
were
not
apparent
at
that
height
after
breakfast
we
devoted
the
hours
from
to
or
to
entomology
the
best
time
for
insects
in
the
forest
being
a
little
before
the
greatest
heat
of
the
day
the
heat
increased
rapidly
towards
two
and
fahr
by
which
time
every
voice
of
bird
or
mammal
was
hushed
only
in
the
trees
was
heard
at
intervals
the
harsh
whirr
of
a
cicada
the
leaves
which
were
so
moist
and
fresh
in
early
morning
now
become
lax
and
drooping
the
flowers
shed
their
petals
our
neighbours
the
indian
and
mulatto
inhabitants
of
the
open
thatched
huts
as
we
returned
home
fatigued
with
our
ramble
were
either
asleep
in
their
hammocks
or
seated
on
mats
in
the
shade
too
languid
even
to
talk
on
most
days
in
june
and
july
a
heavy
shower
would
fall
some
time
in
the
afternoon
producing
a
most
welcome
coolness
the
approach
of
the
was
after
a
uniform
fashion
very
interesting
to
observe
first
the
cool
breeze
which
commenced
to
blow
about
ten
and
which
had
increased
in
force
with
the
increasing
power
of
the
sun
would
flag
and
finally
die
away
the
heat
and
electric
tension
of
the
atmosphere
would
then
become
almost
insupportable
languor
and
uneasiness
would
seize
on
every
one
even
the
denizens
of
the
forest
betraying
it
by
their
motions
white
clouds
would
appear
in
the
cast
and
gather
into
cumuli
with
an
increasing
blackness
along
their
lower
portions
the
whole
eastern
horizon
would
become
almost
suddenly
black
and
this
would
spread
upwards
the
sun
at
length
becoming
obscured
then
the
rush
of
a
mighty
wind
is
heard
through
the
forest
swaying
the
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
bursts
forth
then
a
crash
of
thunder
and
down
streams
the
deluging
rain
such
storms
soon
cease
leaving
motionless
clouds
in
the
sky
until
night
meantime
all
nature
is
refreshed
but
heaps
of
and
fallen
leaves
are
seen
under
the
trees
towards
evening
life
revives
again
and
the
ringing
uproar
is
resumed
from
bush
and
tree
the
following
morning
the
sun
again
rises
in
a
cloudless
sky
and
so
the
cycle
is
completed
spring
summer
and
autumn
as
it
were
in
one
tropical
day
the
days
are
more
or
less
like
this
throughout
the
year
in
this
country
a
little
difference
exists
between
the
dry
and
wet
seasons
but
generally
the
dry
season
which
lasts
from
july
to
december
is
varied
with
showers
and
the
wet
from
january
to
june
with
sunny
days
it
results
from
this
that
the
periodical
phenomena
of
plants
and
animals
do
not
take
place
at
about
the
same
time
in
all
species
or
in
the
individuals
of
any
given
species
as
they
do
in
temperate
countries
of
course
there
is
no
hybernation
nor
as
the
dry
season
is
not
excessive
is
there
any
summer
torpidity
as
in
some
tropical
countries
plants
do
not
flower
or
shed
their
leaves
nor
do
birds
moult
pair
or
breed
simultaneously
in
europe
a
woodland
scene
has
its
spring
its
summer
its
autumn
and
its
winter
aspects
in
the
equatorial
forests
the
aspect
is
the
same
or
nearly
so
every
day
in
the
year
budding
flowering
fruiting
and
leaf
shedding
are
always
going
on
in
one
species
or
other
the
activity
of
birds
and
insects
proceeds
without
interruption
each
species
having
its
own
separate
times
the
colonies
of
wasps
for
instance
do
not
die
off
annually
leaving
only
the
queens
as
in
cold
climates
but
the
succession
of
generations
and
colonies
goes
on
incessantly
it
is
never
either
spring
summer
or
autumn
but
each
day
is
a
combination
of
all
three
with
the
day
and
night
always
of
equal
length
the
atmospheric
disturbances
of
each
day
neutralising
themselves
before
each
succeeding
morn
with
the
sun
in
its
course
proceeding
midway
across
the
sky
and
the
daily
temperature
the
same
within
two
or
three
degrees
throughout
the
year
how
grand
in
its
perfect
equilibrium
and
simplicity
is
the
march
of
nature
under
the
equator
our
evenings
were
generally
fully
employed
preserving
our
collections
and
making
notes
we
dined
at
four
and
took
tea
about
seven
sometimes
we
walked
to
the
city
to
see
brazilian
life
or
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
european
and
american
society
and
so
the
time
passed
away
from
june
to
august
during
this
period
we
made
two
excursions
of
greater
length
to
the
rice
and
of
magoary
an
establishment
owned
by
an
american
gentleman
upton
situated
on
the
banks
of
a
creek
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
about
twelve
miles
from
para
i
will
narrate
some
of
the
incidents
of
these
excursions
and
give
an
account
of
the
more
interesting
observations
made
on
the
natural
history
and
inhabitants
of
these
interior
creeks
and
forests
our
first
trip
to
the
mills
was
by
land
the
creek
on
whose
banks
they
stand
the
iritiri
communicates
with
the
river
pars
through
another
larger
creek
the
magoary
so
that
there
is
a
passage
by
water
but
this
is
about
twenty
miles
round
we
started
at
sunrise
taking
isidoro
with
us
the
road
plunged
at
once
into
the
forest
after
leaving
nazareth
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
enveloped
in
shade
for
some
distance
the
woods
were
of
second
growth
the
original
forest
near
the
town
having
been
formerly
cleared
or
thinned
they
were
dense
and
impenetrable
on
account
of
the
close
growth
of
the
young
trees
and
the
mass
of
thorny
shrubs
and
creepers
these
thickets
swarmed
with
ants
and
they
were
also
frequented
by
a
species
of
manikin
a
little
bird
which
flies
occasionally
across
the
road
emitting
a
strange
noise
made
i
believe
with
its
wings
and
resembling
the
clatter
of
a
small
wooden
rattle
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
further
on
the
character
of
the
woods
began
to
change
and
we
then
found
ourselves
in
the
primaeval
forest
the
appearance
was
greatly
different
from
that
of
the
swampy
tract
i
have
already
described
the
land
was
rather
more
elevated
and
undulating
the
many
swamp
plants
with
their
long
and
broad
leaves
were
wanting
and
there
was
less
underwood
although
the
trees
were
wider
apart
through
this
wilderness
the
road
continued
for
seven
or
eight
miles
the
same
unbroken
forest
extends
all
the
way
to
maranham
and
in
other
directions
as
we
were
told
a
distance
of
about
miles
southward
and
eastward
of
para
in
almost
every
hollow
part
the
road
was
crossed
by
a
brook
whose
cold
dark
waters
were
bridged
over
by
tree
trunks
the
ground
was
carpeted
as
usual
by
lycopodiums
but
it
was
also
encumbered
with
masses
of
vegetable
debris
and
a
thick
coating
of
dead
leaves
fruits
of
many
kinds
were
scattered
about
amongst
which
were
many
sorts
of
beans
some
of
the
pods
a
foot
long
flat
and
leathery
in
texture
others
hard
as
stone
in
one
place
there
was
a
quantity
of
large
empty
wooden
vessels
which
isidoro
told
us
fell
from
the
sapucaya
tree
they
are
called
monkey
cuyas
de
macaco
and
are
the
capsules
which
contain
the
nuts
sold
under
the
name
just
mentioned
in
covent
garden
market
at
the
top
of
the
vessel
is
a
circular
hole
in
which
a
natural
lid
fits
neatly
when
the
nuts
are
ripe
this
lid
becomes
loosened
and
the
heavy
cup
falls
with
a
crash
scattering
the
nuts
over
the
ground
the
tree
which
yields
the
nut
lecythis
ollaria
is
of
immense
height
it
is
closely
allied
to
the
tree
bertholletia
excelsa
whose
seeds
are
also
enclosed
in
large
woody
vessels
but
these
have
no
lid
and
fall
to
the
ground
intact
this
is
the
reason
why
the
one
kind
of
nut
is
so
much
dearer
than
the
other
the
sapucaya
is
not
less
abundant
probably
than
the
bertholletia
but
its
nuts
in
falling
are
scattered
about
and
eaten
by
wild
animals
whilst
the
full
whole
capsules
of
are
collected
by
the
natives
what
attracted
us
chiefly
were
the
colossal
trees
the
general
run
of
trees
had
not
remarkably
thick
stems
the
great
and
uniform
height
to
which
they
grow
without
emitting
a
branch
was
a
much
more
noticeable
feature
than
their
thickness
but
at
intervals
of
a
furlong
or
so
a
veritable
giant
towered
up
only
one
of
these
monstrous
trees
can
grow
within
a
given
space
it
monopolises
the
domain
and
none
but
individuals
of
much
inferior
size
can
find
a
footing
near
it
the
cylindrical
trunks
of
these
larger
trees
were
generally
about
twenty
to
feet
in
circumference
von
martius
mentions
having
measured
trees
in
the
para
district
belonging
to
various
species
symphonia
coccinea
lecythis
sp
and
crataeva
tapia
which
were
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
girth
at
the
point
where
they
become
cylindrical
the
height
of
the
vast
stems
could
not
be
less
than
feet
from
the
ground
to
their
lowest
branch
leavens
at
the
sawmills
told
me
they
frequently
squared
logs
for
sawing
a
hundred
feet
long
of
the
pao
and
the
massaranduba
the
total
height
of
these
trees
stem
and
crown
together
may
be
estimated
at
from
to
feet
where
one
of
them
stands
the
vast
dome
of
foliage
rises
above
the
other
forest
trees
as
a
domed
cathedral
does
above
the
other
buildings
in
a
city
a
very
remarkable
feature
in
these
trees
is
the
growth
of
projections
around
the
lower
part
of
their
stems
the
spaces
between
these
buttresses
which
are
generally
thin
walls
of
wood
form
spacious
chambers
and
may
be
compared
to
stalls
in
a
stable
some
of
them
are
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
persons
the
purpose
of
these
structures
is
as
obvious
at
the
first
glance
as
that
of
the
similar
props
of
brickwork
which
support
a
high
wall
they
are
not
peculiar
to
one
species
but
are
common
to
most
of
the
larger
forest
trees
their
nature
and
manner
of
growth
are
explained
when
a
series
of
young
trees
of
different
ages
is
examined
it
is
then
seen
that
they
are
the
roots
which
have
raised
themselves
out
of
the
earth
growing
gradually
upwards
as
the
increasing
height
of
the
tree
required
augmented
support
thus
they
are
plainly
intended
to
sustain
the
massive
crown
and
trunk
in
these
crowded
forests
where
lateral
growth
of
the
roots
in
the
earth
is
rendered
difficult
by
the
multitude
of
competitors
the
other
grand
forest
trees
whose
native
names
we
learned
were
the
moiratinga
the
white
or
king
tree
probably
the
same
as
or
allied
to
the
mora
excelsa
which
sir
robert
schomburgh
discovered
in
british
guiana
the
samauma
eriodendron
samauma
and
the
massaranduba
or
cow
tree
the
is
the
most
remarkable
we
had
already
heard
a
good
deal
about
this
tree
and
about
its
producing
from
its
bark
a
copious
supply
of
milk
as
pleasant
to
drink
as
that
of
the
cow
we
had
also
eaten
its
fruit
in
para
where
it
is
sold
in
the
streets
by
negro
market
women
and
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
the
durableness
in
water
of
its
timber
we
were
glad
therefore
to
see
this
wonderful
tree
growing
in
its
native
wilds
it
is
one
of
the
largest
of
the
forest
monarchs
and
is
peculiar
in
appearance
on
account
of
its
reddish
and
ragged
bark
a
decoction
of
the
bark
i
was
told
is
used
as
a
red
dye
for
cloth
a
few
days
afterwards
we
tasted
its
milk
which
was
drawn
from
dry
logs
that
had
been
standing
many
days
in
the
hot
sun
at
the
it
was
pleasant
with
coffee
but
had
a
slight
rankness
when
drunk
pure
it
soon
thickens
to
a
glue
which
is
excessively
tenacious
and
is
often
used
to
cement
broken
crockery
i
was
told
that
it
was
not
safe
to
drink
much
of
it
for
a
slave
had
recently
nearly
lost
his
life
through
taking
it
too
freely
in
some
parts
of
the
road
ferns
were
conspicuous
objects
but
i
afterwards
found
them
much
more
numerous
on
the
maranham
road
especially
in
one
place
where
the
whole
forest
glade
formed
a
vast
fernery
the
ground
was
covered
with
terrestrial
species
and
the
tree
trunks
clothed
with
climbing
and
epiphytous
kinds
i
saw
no
tree
ferns
in
the
para
district
they
belong
to
hilly
regions
some
occur
however
on
the
upper
amazons
such
were
the
principal
features
in
the
vegetation
of
the
wilderness
but
where
were
the
flowers
to
our
great
disappointment
we
saw
none
or
only
such
as
were
insignificant
in
appearance
orchids
are
very
rare
in
the
dense
forests
of
the
low
lands
i
believe
it
is
now
tolerably
well
ascertained
that
the
majority
of
forest
trees
in
equatorial
brazil
have
small
and
inconspicuous
flowers
insects
are
also
rare
in
the
forest
of
course
they
would
not
be
found
where
their
favourite
food
was
wanting
but
i
always
noticed
that
even
where
flowers
occurred
in
the
forest
few
or
no
insects
were
seen
upon
them
in
the
open
country
or
campos
of
santarem
on
the
lower
amazons
flowering
trees
and
bushes
are
more
abundant
and
there
a
large
number
of
floral
insects
are
attracted
the
forest
bees
of
south
america
belonging
to
the
genera
melipona
and
euglossa
are
more
frequently
seen
feeding
on
the
sweet
sap
which
exudes
from
the
trees
or
on
the
excrement
of
birds
on
leaves
rather
than
on
flowers
we
were
disappointed
also
in
not
meeting
with
any
of
the
larger
animals
in
the
forest
there
was
no
tumultuous
movement
or
sound
of
life
we
did
not
see
or
hear
monkeys
and
no
tapir
or
jaguar
crossed
our
path
birds
also
appeared
to
be
exceedingly
scarce
we
heard
however
occasionally
the
wailing
note
of
the
inambu
a
kind
of
partridge
crypturus
cincreus
and
also
in
the
hollows
on
the
banks
of
the
rivulets
the
noisy
notes
of
another
bird
which
seemed
to
go
in
pairs
amongst
the
calling
to
each
other
as
they
went
these
notes
resounded
through
the
wilderness
another
solitary
bird
had
a
most
sweet
and
melancholy
song
it
consisted
simply
of
a
few
notes
uttered
in
a
plaintive
key
commencing
high
and
descending
by
harmonic
intervals
it
was
probably
a
species
of
warbler
of
the
genus
trichas
all
these
notes
of
birds
are
very
striking
and
characteristic
of
the
forest
i
afterwards
saw
reason
to
modify
my
opinion
founded
on
these
first
impressions
with
regard
to
the
amount
and
variety
of
animal
life
in
this
and
other
parts
of
the
amazonian
forests
there
is
in
fact
a
great
variety
of
mammals
birds
and
reptiles
but
they
are
widely
scattered
and
all
excessively
shy
of
man
the
region
is
so
extensive
and
uniform
in
the
forest
clothing
of
its
surface
that
it
is
only
at
long
intervals
that
animals
are
seen
in
abundance
when
some
particular
spot
is
found
which
is
more
attractive
than
others
brazil
moreover
is
poor
throughout
in
terrestrial
mammals
and
the
species
are
of
small
size
they
do
not
therefore
form
a
conspicuous
feature
in
its
forests
the
huntsman
would
be
disappointed
who
expected
to
find
here
flocks
of
animals
similar
to
the
buffalo
herds
of
north
america
or
the
swarms
of
antelopes
and
herds
of
ponderous
pachyderms
of
southern
africa
the
largest
and
most
interesting
portion
of
the
brazilian
mammal
fauna
is
arboreal
in
its
habits
this
feature
of
the
animal
denizens
of
these
forests
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
most
intensely
arboreal
animals
in
the
world
are
the
south
american
monkeys
of
the
family
cebidae
many
of
which
have
a
fifth
hand
for
climbing
in
their
prehensile
tails
adapted
for
this
function
by
their
strong
muscular
development
and
the
naked
palms
under
their
tips
this
seems
to
teach
us
that
the
south
american
fauna
has
been
slowly
adapted
to
a
forest
life
and
therefore
that
extensive
forests
must
have
always
existed
since
the
region
was
first
peopled
by
mammalia
but
to
this
subject
and
to
the
natural
history
of
the
monkeys
of
which
species
inhabit
the
amazon
region
i
shall
have
to
return
we
often
read
in
books
of
travels
of
the
silence
and
gloom
of
the
brazilian
forests
they
are
realities
and
the
impression
deepens
on
a
longer
acquaintance
the
few
sounds
of
birds
are
of
that
pensive
or
mysterious
character
which
intensifies
the
feeling
of
solitude
rather
than
imparts
a
sense
of
life
and
cheerfulness
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
the
stillness
a
sudden
yell
or
scream
will
startle
one
this
comes
from
some
defenseless
animal
which
is
pounced
upon
by
a
or
stealthy
morning
and
evening
the
howling
monkeys
make
a
most
fearful
and
harrowing
noise
under
which
it
is
difficult
to
keep
up
one
buoyancy
of
spirit
the
feeling
of
inhospitable
wildness
which
the
forest
is
calculated
to
inspire
is
increased
tenfold
under
this
fearful
uproar
often
even
in
the
still
hours
of
midday
a
sudden
crash
will
be
heard
resounding
afar
through
the
wilderness
as
some
great
bough
or
entire
tree
falls
to
the
ground
there
are
besides
many
sounds
which
it
is
impossible
to
account
for
i
found
the
natives
generally
as
much
at
a
loss
in
this
respect
as
myself
sometimes
a
sound
is
heard
like
the
clang
of
an
iron
bar
against
a
hard
hollow
tree
or
a
piercing
cry
rends
the
air
these
are
not
repeated
and
the
succeeding
silence
tends
to
heighten
the
unpleasant
impression
which
they
make
on
the
mind
with
the
native
it
is
always
the
curupira
the
wild
man
or
spirit
of
the
forest
which
produces
all
noises
they
are
unable
to
explain
for
myths
are
the
rude
theories
which
mankind
in
the
infancy
of
knowledge
invent
to
explain
natural
phenomena
the
curupira
is
a
mysterious
being
whose
attributes
are
uncertain
for
they
vary
according
to
locality
sometimes
he
is
described
as
a
kind
of
orangutang
being
covered
with
long
shaggy
hair
and
living
in
trees
at
others
he
is
said
to
have
cloven
feet
and
a
bright
red
face
he
has
a
wife
and
children
and
sometimes
comes
down
to
the
rocas
to
steal
the
mandioca
at
one
time
i
had
a
mameluco
youth
in
my
service
whose
head
was
full
of
the
legends
and
superstitions
of
the
country
he
always
went
with
me
into
the
forest
in
fact
i
could
not
get
him
to
go
alone
and
whenever
we
heard
any
of
the
strange
noises
mentioned
above
he
used
to
tremble
with
fear
he
would
crouch
down
behind
me
and
beg
of
me
to
turn
back
his
alarm
ceasing
only
after
he
had
made
a
charm
to
protect
us
from
the
curupira
for
this
purpose
he
took
a
young
palm
leaf
plaited
it
and
formed
it
into
a
ring
which
he
hung
to
a
branch
on
our
track
at
length
after
a
six
hour
walk
we
arrived
at
our
destination
the
last
mile
or
two
having
been
again
through
forest
the
mills
formed
a
large
pile
of
buildings
pleasantly
situated
in
a
cleared
tract
of
land
many
acres
in
extent
and
everywhere
surrounded
by
the
perpetual
forest
we
were
received
in
the
kindest
manner
by
the
overseer
leavens
who
showed
us
all
that
was
interesting
about
the
place
and
took
us
to
the
best
spots
in
the
neighbourhood
for
birds
and
insects
the
mills
were
built
a
long
time
ago
by
a
wealthy
brazilian
they
had
belonged
to
upton
for
many
years
i
was
told
that
when
the
revolutionists
were
preparing
for
their
attack
on
para
they
occupied
the
place
but
not
the
slightest
injury
was
done
to
the
machinery
or
building
for
the
leaders
said
it
was
against
the
portuguese
and
their
party
that
they
were
at
war
not
against
the
other
foreigners
the
iritiri
creek
at
the
mills
is
only
a
few
yards
wide
it
winds
about
between
two
lofty
walls
of
forest
for
some
distance
then
becomes
much
broader
and
finally
joins
the
magoary
there
are
many
other
ramifications
creeks
or
channels
which
lead
to
retired
hamlets
and
scattered
houses
inhabited
by
people
of
mixed
white
indian
and
negro
descent
many
of
them
did
business
with
leavens
bringing
for
sale
their
little
harvests
of
rice
or
a
few
logs
of
timber
it
was
interesting
to
see
them
in
their
little
montarias
sometimes
the
boats
were
managed
by
handsome
healthy
young
lads
loosely
clad
in
a
straw
hat
white
shirt
and
dark
blue
trousers
turned
up
to
the
knee
they
steered
paddled
and
managed
the
varejao
the
boating
pole
with
much
grace
and
dexterity
we
made
many
excursions
down
the
iritiri
and
saw
much
of
these
creeks
besides
our
second
visit
to
the
mills
was
by
water
the
magoary
is
a
magnificent
channel
the
different
branches
form
quite
a
labyrinth
and
the
land
is
everywhere
of
little
elevation
all
these
smaller
rivers
throughout
the
para
estuary
are
of
the
nature
of
creeks
the
land
is
so
level
that
the
short
local
rivers
have
no
sources
and
downward
currents
like
rivers
as
we
generally
understand
them
they
serve
the
purpose
of
draining
the
land
but
instead
of
having
a
constant
current
one
way
they
have
a
regular
ebb
and
flow
with
the
tide
the
natives
call
them
in
the
tupi
language
igarapes
or
the
igarapes
and
furos
or
channels
which
are
infinite
in
number
in
this
great
river
delta
are
characteristic
of
the
country
the
land
is
everywhere
covered
with
impenetrable
forests
the
houses
and
villages
are
all
on
the
waterside
and
nearly
all
communication
is
by
water
this
life
of
the
people
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
country
for
short
excursions
and
for
fishing
in
still
waters
a
small
boat
called
montaria
is
universally
used
it
is
made
of
five
planks
a
broad
one
for
the
bottom
bent
into
the
proper
shape
by
the
action
of
heat
two
narrow
ones
for
the
sides
and
two
small
triangular
pieces
for
stem
and
stern
it
has
no
rudder
the
paddle
serves
for
both
steering
and
propelling
the
montaria
takes
here
the
place
of
the
horse
mule
or
camel
of
other
regions
besides
one
or
more
montarias
almost
every
family
has
a
larger
canoe
called
igarite
this
is
fitted
with
two
masts
a
rudder
and
keel
and
has
an
arched
awning
or
cabin
near
the
stern
made
of
a
framework
of
tough
lianas
thatched
with
palm
leaves
in
the
igarite
they
will
cross
stormy
rivers
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
broad
the
natives
are
all
it
is
often
remarked
by
white
residents
that
an
indian
is
a
carpenter
and
shipwright
by
intuition
it
is
astonishing
to
see
in
what
crazy
vessels
these
people
will
risk
themselves
i
have
seen
indians
cross
rivers
in
a
leaky
montaria
when
it
required
the
nicest
equilibrium
to
keep
the
leak
just
above
water
a
movement
of
a
hair
breadth
would
send
all
to
the
bottom
but
they
managed
to
cross
in
safety
they
are
especially
careful
when
they
have
strangers
under
their
charge
and
it
is
the
custom
of
brazilian
and
portuguese
travellers
to
leave
the
whole
management
to
them
when
they
are
alone
they
are
more
reckless
and
often
have
to
swim
for
their
lives
if
a
squall
overtakes
them
as
they
are
crossing
in
a
canoe
they
all
jump
overboard
and
swim
about
until
the
heavy
sea
subsides
then
they
a
few
words
on
the
aboriginal
population
of
the
para
estuary
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
the
banks
of
the
para
were
originally
inhabited
by
a
number
of
distinct
tribes
who
in
their
habits
resembled
very
much
the
natives
of
the
from
maranham
to
bahia
it
is
related
that
one
large
tribe
the
tupinambas
migrated
from
pernambuco
to
the
amazons
one
fact
seems
to
be
namely
that
all
the
coast
tribes
were
far
more
advanced
in
civilisation
and
milder
in
their
manners
than
the
savages
who
inhabited
the
interior
lands
of
brazil
they
were
settled
in
villages
and
addicted
to
agriculture
they
navigated
the
rivers
in
large
canoes
called
ubas
made
of
immense
tree
trunks
in
these
they
used
to
go
on
war
expeditions
carrying
in
the
prows
their
trophies
and
calabash
rattles
whose
clatter
was
meant
to
intimidate
their
enemies
they
were
gentle
in
disposition
and
received
the
early
portuguese
settlers
with
great
friendliness
the
inland
savages
on
the
other
hand
led
a
wandering
life
as
they
do
at
the
present
time
only
coming
down
occasionally
to
rob
the
plantations
of
the
coast
tribes
who
always
entertained
the
greatest
enmity
towards
them
the
original
indian
tribes
of
the
district
are
now
either
civilised
or
have
amalgamated
with
the
white
and
negro
immigrants
their
distinguishing
tribal
names
have
long
been
forgotten
and
the
race
bears
now
the
general
appellation
of
tapuyo
which
seems
to
have
been
one
of
the
names
of
the
ancient
tupinambas
the
indians
of
the
interior
still
remaining
in
the
savage
state
are
called
by
the
brazilians
indios
or
gentios
heathens
all
the
tapuyos
of
the
villages
and
in
fact
the
inhabitants
of
retired
places
generally
speak
the
lingoa
geral
a
language
adapted
by
the
jesuit
missionaries
from
the
original
idiom
of
the
tupinambas
the
language
of
the
guaranis
a
nation
living
on
the
banks
of
the
paraguay
is
a
dialect
of
it
and
hence
it
is
called
by
philologists
the
guarani
language
printed
grammars
of
it
are
always
on
sale
at
the
shops
of
the
para
booksellers
the
fact
of
one
language
having
been
spoken
over
so
wide
an
extent
of
country
as
that
from
the
amazons
to
paraguay
is
quite
an
isolated
one
in
this
country
and
points
to
considerable
migrations
of
the
indian
tribes
in
former
times
at
present
the
languages
spoken
by
neighbouring
tribes
on
the
banks
of
the
interior
rivers
are
totally
distinct
on
the
jurua
even
scattered
hordes
belonging
to
the
same
tribe
are
not
able
to
understand
each
other
the
civilised
tapuyo
of
para
differs
in
no
essential
point
in
physical
or
moral
qualities
from
the
indian
of
the
interior
he
is
more
stoutly
built
being
better
fed
than
some
of
them
but
in
this
respect
there
are
great
differences
amongst
the
tribes
themselves
he
presents
all
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
american
red
man
the
skin
of
a
coppery
brown
colour
the
features
of
the
face
broad
and
the
hair
black
thick
and
straight
he
is
generally
about
the
middle
height
has
a
broad
muscular
chest
but
somewhat
thick
legs
and
arms
and
small
hands
and
feet
the
cheek
bones
are
not
generally
prominent
the
eyes
are
black
and
seldom
oblique
like
those
of
the
tartar
races
of
eastern
asia
which
are
supposed
to
have
sprung
from
the
same
original
stock
as
the
american
red
man
the
features
exhibit
scarcely
any
mobility
of
expression
this
is
connected
with
the
excessively
apathetic
and
undemonstrative
character
of
the
race
they
never
betray
in
fact
they
do
not
feel
keenly
the
emotions
of
joy
grief
wonder
fear
and
so
forth
they
can
never
be
excited
to
enthusiasm
but
they
have
strong
affections
especially
those
connected
with
family
it
is
commonly
stated
by
the
whites
and
negroes
that
the
tapuyo
is
ungrateful
brazilian
mistresses
of
households
who
have
much
experience
of
indians
have
always
a
long
list
of
instances
to
relate
to
the
stranger
showing
their
base
ingratitude
they
certainly
do
not
appear
to
remember
or
think
of
repaying
benefits
but
this
is
probably
because
they
did
not
require
and
do
not
value
such
benefits
as
their
masters
confer
upon
them
i
have
known
instances
of
attachment
and
fidelity
on
the
part
of
indians
towards
their
masters
but
these
are
exceptional
cases
all
the
actions
of
the
indian
show
that
his
ruling
desire
is
to
be
let
alone
he
is
attached
to
his
home
his
quiet
monotonous
forest
and
river
life
he
likes
to
go
to
towns
occasionally
to
see
the
wonders
introduced
by
the
white
man
but
he
has
a
great
repugnance
to
living
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
he
prefers
handicraft
to
field
labour
and
especially
dislikes
binding
himself
to
regular
labour
for
hire
he
is
shy
and
uneasy
before
strangers
but
if
they
visit
his
abode
he
treats
them
well
for
he
has
a
rooted
appreciation
of
the
duty
of
hospitality
there
is
a
pride
about
him
and
being
naturally
formal
and
polite
he
acts
the
host
with
great
dignity
he
withdraws
from
towns
as
soon
as
the
stir
of
civilisation
begins
to
make
itself
felt
when
we
first
arrived
at
para
many
indian
families
resided
there
for
the
mode
of
living
at
that
time
was
more
like
that
of
a
large
village
than
a
city
but
as
soon
as
river
steamers
and
more
business
activity
were
introduced
they
all
gradually
took
themselves
away
these
characteristics
of
the
para
indians
are
applicable
of
course
to
some
extent
to
the
mamelucos
who
now
constitute
a
great
proportion
of
the
population
the
inflexibility
of
character
of
the
indian
and
his
total
inability
to
accommodate
himself
to
new
arrangements
will
infallibly
lead
to
his
extinction
as
immigrants
endowed
with
more
supple
organisations
increase
and
civilisation
advances
in
the
amazon
region
but
as
the
different
races
amalgamate
readily
and
the
offspring
of
white
and
indian
often
become
distinguished
brazilian
citizens
there
is
little
reason
to
regret
the
fate
of
the
race
formerly
the
indian
was
harshly
treated
and
even
now
he
is
so
in
many
parts
of
the
interior
but
according
to
the
laws
of
brazil
he
is
a
free
citizen
having
equal
privileges
with
the
whites
and
there
are
very
strong
enactments
providing
against
the
enslaving
and
of
the
indians
the
residents
of
the
interior
who
have
no
higher
principles
to
counteract
instinctive
selfishness
or
antipathy
of
race
can
not
comprehend
why
they
are
not
allowed
to
compel
indians
to
work
for
them
seeing
that
they
will
not
do
it
of
their
own
accord
the
inevitable
result
of
the
conflict
of
interests
between
a
european
and
a
weaker
indigenous
race
when
the
two
come
in
contact
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
latter
in
the
para
district
the
indians
are
no
longer
enslaved
but
they
are
deprived
of
their
lands
and
this
they
feel
bitterly
as
one
of
them
an
industrious
and
worthy
man
related
to
me
is
not
a
similar
state
of
things
now
exhibited
in
new
zealand
between
the
maoris
and
the
english
colonists
it
is
very
interesting
to
read
of
the
bitter
contests
that
were
carried
on
from
the
year
to
between
the
portuguese
immigrants
in
brazil
and
the
jesuit
and
other
missionaries
they
were
similar
to
those
which
have
recently
taken
place
in
south
africa
between
the
beers
and
the
english
missionaries
but
they
were
on
a
much
larger
scale
the
jesuits
as
far
as
i
could
glean
from
tradition
and
history
were
actuated
by
the
same
motives
as
our
missionaries
and
they
seemed
like
them
to
have
been
in
great
measure
successful
in
teaching
the
pure
and
elevated
christian
morality
to
the
simple
natives
but
the
attempt
was
vain
to
protect
the
weaker
race
from
the
inevitable
ruin
which
awaited
it
in
the
natural
struggle
with
the
stronger
one
in
the
white
colonists
finally
prevailed
the
jesuits
were
forced
to
leave
the
country
and
the
happy
mission
villages
went
to
ruin
since
then
the
aboriginal
race
has
gone
on
decreasing
in
numbers
under
the
treatment
which
it
has
received
it
is
now
as
i
have
already
stated
protected
by
the
laws
of
the
central
government
on
our
second
visit
to
the
mills
we
stayed
ten
days
there
is
a
large
reservoir
and
also
a
natural
lake
near
the
place
both
containing
aquatic
plants
whose
leaves
rest
on
the
surface
like
our
water
lilies
but
they
are
not
so
elegant
as
our
nymphaea
either
in
leaf
or
flower
on
the
banks
of
these
pools
grow
quantities
of
a
species
of
palm
tree
the
carana
whose
stems
are
surrounded
by
whorls
of
strong
spines
i
sometimes
took
a
montaria
and
paddled
myself
alone
down
the
creek
one
day
i
got
upset
and
had
to
land
on
a
grassy
slope
leading
to
an
old
plantation
where
i
ran
about
naked
while
my
clothes
were
being
dried
on
a
bush
the
iritiri
creek
is
not
so
picturesque
as
many
others
which
i
subsequently
explored
towards
the
magoary
the
banks
at
the
edge
of
the
water
are
clothed
with
mangrove
bushes
and
beneath
them
the
muddy
banks
into
which
the
long
roots
that
hang
down
from
the
fruit
before
it
leaves
the
branches
strike
their
fibres
swarm
with
crabs
on
the
lower
branches
the
beautiful
bird
ardea
helias
is
found
this
is
a
small
heron
of
exquisitely
graceful
shape
and
mien
its
plumage
is
minutely
variegated
with
bars
and
spots
of
many
colours
like
the
wings
of
certain
kinds
of
moths
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
bird
in
the
woods
on
account
of
its
sombre
colours
and
the
shadiness
of
its
but
its
note
a
soft
whistle
often
betrays
its
hiding
place
i
was
told
by
the
indians
that
it
builds
in
trees
and
that
the
nest
which
is
made
of
clay
is
beautifully
constructed
it
is
a
favourite
of
the
brazilians
who
call
it
pavao
pronounced
pavaong
or
peacock
i
often
had
opportunities
to
observe
its
habits
it
soon
becomes
tame
and
walks
about
the
floors
of
houses
picking
up
scraps
of
food
or
catching
insects
which
it
secures
by
walking
gently
to
the
place
where
they
settle
and
spearing
them
with
its
long
slender
beak
it
allows
itself
to
be
handled
by
children
and
will
answer
to
its
name
pavao
pavao
walking
up
with
a
dainty
circumspect
gait
and
taking
a
fly
or
beetle
from
the
hand
during
these
rambles
by
land
and
water
we
increased
our
collections
considerably
before
we
left
the
mills
we
arranged
a
joint
excursion
to
the
tocantins
leavens
wished
to
ascend
that
river
to
ascertain
if
the
reports
were
true
that
cedar
grew
abundantly
between
the
lowermost
cataract
and
the
mouth
of
the
araguava
and
we
agreed
to
accompany
him
while
we
were
at
the
mills
a
portuguese
trader
arrived
with
a
quantity
of
logs
of
this
cedar
which
he
had
gathered
from
the
floating
timber
in
the
current
of
the
main
amazons
the
tree
producing
this
wood
which
is
named
cedar
on
account
of
the
similarity
of
its
aroma
to
that
of
the
true
cedars
is
not
of
course
a
coniferous
tree
as
no
member
of
that
class
is
found
in
equatorial
america
at
least
in
the
amazons
region
it
is
according
to
von
martius
the
cedrela
odorata
an
exogen
belonging
to
the
same
order
as
the
mahogany
tree
the
wood
is
light
and
the
tree
is
therefore
on
falling
into
the
water
floated
down
with
the
river
currents
it
must
grow
in
great
quantities
somewhere
in
the
interior
to
judge
from
the
number
of
uprooted
trees
annually
carried
to
the
sea
and
as
the
wood
is
much
esteemed
for
cabinet
work
and
canoe
building
it
is
of
some
importance
to
learn
where
a
regular
supply
can
be
obtained
we
were
glad
of
course
to
arrange
with
leavens
who
was
familiar
with
the
language
and
an
adept
in
river
navigation
so
we
returned
to
para
to
ship
our
collections
for
england
and
prepare
for
the
journey
to

before
leaving
the
subject
of

where
i
resided
as
already
stated
in
all
eighteen
months
it
will
be
necessary
to
give
a
more
detailed
account
of
several
matters
connected
with
the
customs
of
the
people
and
the
natural
history
of

which
have
hitherto
been
only
briefly
mentioned
i

an

and

of

in
for
the
end
of
this
narrative
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
our
stay
many
of
those
religious
festivals
took
place
which
occupied
so
large
a
share
of
the
time
and
thoughts
of
the
people
these
were
splendid
affairs
wherein
processions
through
the
streets
accompanied
by
thousands
of
people
military
displays
the
clatter
of
fireworks
and
the
clang
of
military
music
were
superadded
to
pompous
religious
services
in
the
churches
to
those
who
had
witnessed
similar
ceremonies
in
the
southern
countries
of
europe
there
would
be
nothing
remarkable
perhaps
in
these
doings
except
their
taking
place
amidst
the
splendours
of
tropical
nature
but
to
me
they
were
full
of
novelty
and
were
besides
interesting
as
exhibiting
much
that
was
peculiar
in
the
manners
of
the
people
the
festivals
celebrate
either
the
anniversaries
of
events
concerning
saints
or
those
of
the
more
important
transactions
in
the
life
of
christ
to
them
have
been
added
since
the
independence
many
gala
days
connected
with
the
events
in
the
brazilian
national
history
but
these
have
all
a
character
the
holidays
had
become
so
numerous
and
interfered
so
much
with
trade
and
industry
towards
the
year
that
the
brazilian
government
was
obliged
to
reduce
them
obtaining
the
necessary
permission
from
rome
to
abolish
several
which
were
of
minor
importance
many
of
those
which
have
been
retained
are
declining
in
importance
since
the
introduction
of
railways
and
steamboats
and
the
increased
devotion
of
the
people
to
commerce
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
however
they
were
in
full
glory
the
way
they
were
managed
was
in
this
fashion
a
general
manager
or
juiz
for
each
festival
was
elected
by
lot
every
year
in
the
vestry
of
the
church
and
to
him
were
handed
over
all
the
paraphernalia
pertaining
to
the
particular
festival
which
he
was
chosen
to
manage
the
image
of
the
saint
the
banners
silver
crowns
and
so
forth
he
then
employed
a
number
of
people
to
go
the
round
of
the
parish
and
collect
alms
towards
defraying
the
expenses
it
was
considered
that
the
greater
the
amount
of
money
spent
in
wax
candles
fireworks
music
and
feasting
the
greater
the
honour
done
to
the
saint
if
the
juiz
was
a
rich
man
he
seldom
sent
out
but
celebrated
the
whole
affair
at
his
own
expense
which
was
sometimes
to
the
extent
of
several
hundred
pounds
each
festival
lasted
nine
days
a
novena
and
in
many
cases
refreshments
for
the
public
were
provided
every
evening
in
the
smaller
towns
a
ball
took
place
two
or
three
evenings
during
the
novena
and
on
the
last
day
there
was
a
grand
dinner
the
priest
of
course
had
to
be
paid
very
liberally
especially
for
the
sermon
delivered
on
the
saint
day
or
termination
of
the
festival
sermons
being
extra
duty
in
brazil
there
was
much
difference
as
to
the
accessories
of
these
festivals
between
the
interior
towns
and
villages
and
the
capital
but
little
or
no
work
was
done
anywhere
whilst
they
lasted
and
they
tended
much
to
demoralise
the
people
it
was
soon
perceived
that
religion
is
rather
the
amusement
of
the
paraenses
than
their
serious
exercise
the
ideas
of
the
majority
evidently
do
not
reach
beyond
the
belief
that
all
the
proceedings
are
in
each
case
in
honour
of
the
particular
wooden
image
enshrined
at
the
church
the
uneducated
portuguese
immigrants
seemed
to
me
to
have
very
degrading
notions
of
religion
i
have
often
travelled
in
the
company
of
these
shining
examples
of
european
enlightenment
they
generally
carry
with
them
wherever
they
go
a
small
image
of
some
favourite
saint
in
their
trunks
and
when
a
squall
or
any
other
danger
arises
their
first
impulse
is
to
rush
to
the
cabin
take
out
the
image
and
clasp
it
to
their
lips
whilst
uttering
a
prayer
for
protection
the
negroes
and
mulattos
are
similar
in
this
respect
to
the
low
portuguese
but
i
think
they
show
a
purer
devotional
feeling
and
in
conversation
i
have
always
found
them
to
be
more
rational
in
religious
views
than
the
lower
orders
of
portuguese
as
to
the
indians
with
the
exception
of
the
more
civilised
families
residing
near
the
large
towns
they
exhibit
no
religious
sentiment
at
all
they
have
their
own
patron
saint
thome
and
celebrate
his
anniversary
in
the
orthodox
way
for
they
are
fond
of
observing
all
the
formalities
but
they
think
the
feasting
to
be
of
equal
importance
with
the
church
ceremonies
at
some
of
the
festivals
masquerading
forms
a
large
part
of
the
proceedings
and
then
the
indians
really
shine
they
get
up
capital
imitations
of
wild
animals
dress
themselves
to
represent
the
caypor
and
other
fabulous
creatures
of
the
forest
and
act
their
parts
throughout
with
great
cleverness
when
festival
takes
place
every
employer
of
indians
knows
that
all
his
men
will
get
drunk
the
indian
generally
too
shy
to
ask
directly
for
cashaca
rum
is
then
very
bold
he
asks
for
a
frasco
at
once
bottles
and
says
if
interrogated
that
he
is
going
to
fuddle
in
honour
of
thome
in
the
city
of
para
the
provincial
government
assists
to
augment
the
splendour
of
the
religious
holidays
the
processions
which
traverse
the
principal
streets
consist
in
the
first
place
of
the
image
of
the
saint
and
those
of
several
other
subordinate
ones
belonging
to
the
same
church
these
are
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
respectable
householders
who
volunteer
for
the
purpose
sometimes
you
will
see
your
neighbour
the
grocer
or
the
carpenter
groaning
under
the
load
the
priest
and
his
crowd
of
attendants
precede
the
images
arrayed
in
embroidered
robes
and
protected
by
magnificent
sunshades
no
useless
ornament
here
for
the
heat
is
very
great
when
the
sun
is
not
obscured
on
each
side
of
the
long
line
the
citizens
walk
clad
in
crimson
silk
cloaks
and
holding
each
a
large
lighted
wax
candle
behind
follows
a
regiment
or
two
of
foot
soldiers
with
their
bands
of
music
and
last
of
all
the
crowd
the
coloured
people
being
cleanly
dressed
and
preserving
a
grave
demeanour
the
women
are
always
in
great
force
their
luxuriant
black
hair
decorated
with
jasmines
white
orchids
and
other
tropical
flowers
they
are
dressed
in
their
usual
holiday
attire
gauze
chemises
and
black
silk
petticoats
their
necks
are
adorned
with
links
of
gold
beads
which
when
they
are
slaves
are
generally
the
property
of
their
mistresses
who
love
thus
to
display
their
wealth
at
night
when
festivals
are
going
on
in
the
grassy
squares
around
the
suburban
churches
there
is
really
much
to
admire
a
great
deal
that
is
peculiar
in
the
land
and
the
life
of
its
inhabitants
can
be
seen
best
at
those
times
the
cheerful
white
church
is
brilliantly
lighted
up
and
the
music
not
of
a
very
solemn
description
peals
forth
from
the
open
windows
and
doors
numbers
of
young
negresses
line
the
path
to
the
church
doors
with
stands
of
liqueurs
sweetmeats
and
cigarettes
which
they
sell
to
the
outsiders
a
short
distance
off
is
heard
the
rattle
of
and
roulette
at
the
stalls
when
the
festival
happens
on
moonlit
nights
the
whole
scene
is
very
striking
to
a
newcomer
around
the
square
are
groups
of
tall
palm
trees
and
beyond
it
over
the
illuminated
houses
appear
the
thick
groves
of
mangoes
near
the
suburban
avenues
from
which
comes
the
perpetual
ringing
din
of
insect
life
the
soft
tropical
moonlight
lends
a
wonderful
charm
to
the
whole
the
inhabitants
are
all
out
dressed
in
their
best
the
upper
classes
who
come
to
enjoy
the
fine
evening
and
the
general
cheerfulness
are
seated
on
chairs
around
the
doors
of
friendly
houses
there
is
no
boisterous
conviviality
but
a
quiet
enjoyment
seems
to
be
felt
everywhere
and
a
gentle
courtesy
rules
among
all
classes
and
colours
i
have
seen
a
dressed
colonel
from
the
president
palace
walk
up
to
a
mulatto
and
politely
ask
his
permission
to
take
a
light
from
his
cigar
when
the
service
is
over
the
church
bells
are
set
ringing
a
shower
of
rockets
mounts
upwards
the
bands
strike
up
and
parties
of
coloured
people
in
the
booths
begin
their
dances
about
ten
the
brazilian
national
air
is
played
and
all
disperse
quietly
and
soberly
to
their
homes
at
the
festival
of
corpus
christi
there
was
a
very
pretty
arrangement
the
large
green
square
of
the
trinidade
was
lighted
up
all
round
with
bonfires
on
one
side
a
fine
pavilion
was
erected
the
upright
posts
consisting
of
real
palm
trees
the
mauritia
flexuosa
which
had
been
brought
from
the
forest
stems
and
heads
entire
and
fixed
in
the
ground
the
booth
was
illuminated
with
coloured
lamps
and
lined
with
red
and
white
cloth
in
it
were
seated
the
ladies
not
all
of
pure
caucasian
blood
but
presenting
a
fine
sample
of
para
beauty
and
fashion
the
grandest
of
all
these
festivals
is
that
held
in
honour
of
our
lady
of
nazareth
it
is
i
believe
peculiar
to
para
as
i
have
said
before
it
falls
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
moon
about
the
middle
of
the
dry
season
that
is
in
october
or
november
and
lasts
like
the
others
nine
days
on
the
first
day
a
very
extensive
procession
takes
place
starting
from
the
cathedral
whither
the
image
of
the
saint
had
been
conveyed
some
days
previous
and
terminating
at
the
chapel
or
hermitage
as
it
is
called
of
the
saint
at
nazareth
a
distance
of
more
than
two
miles
the
whole
population
turns
out
on
this
occasion
all
the
soldiers
both
of
the
line
and
the
national
guard
take
part
in
it
each
battalion
accompanied
by
its
band
of
music
the
civil
authorities
also
with
the
president
at
their
head
and
the
principal
citizens
including
many
of
the
foreign
residents
join
in
the
line
the
boat
of
the
shipwrecked
portuguese
vessel
is
carried
after
the
saint
on
the
shoulders
of
officers
or
men
of
the
brazilian
navy
and
along
with
it
are
borne
the
other
symbols
of
the
miracles
which
our
lady
is
supposed
to
have
performed
the
procession
starts
soon
after
the
sun
heat
begins
to
moderate
that
is
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
the
image
is
deposited
in
the
chapel
the
festival
is
considered
to
be
inaugurated
and
the
village
every
evening
becomes
the
resort
of
the
population
the
holiday
portion
of
the
programme
being
preceded
of
course
by
a
religious
service
in
the
chapel
the
aspect
of
the
place
is
then
that
of
a
fair
without
the
humour
and
fun
but
at
the
same
time
without
the
noise
and
coarseness
of
similar
holidays
in
england
large
rooms
are
set
apart
for
panoramic
and
other
exhibitions
to
which
the
public
is
admitted
gratis
in
the
course
of
each
evening
large
displays
of
fireworks
take
place
all
arranged
according
to
a
published
programme
of
the
festival
the
various
ceremonies
which
take
place
during
lent
seemed
to
me
the
most
impressive
and
some
of
them
were
exceedingly
arranged
the
people
both
performers
and
spectators
conduct
themselves
with
more
gravity
on
these
occasions
and
there
is
no
performances
representing
the
last
events
in
the
life
of
christ
are
enacted
in
the
churches
or
streets
in
such
a
way
as
to
remind
one
of
the
old
miracle
plays
or
mysteries
a
few
days
before
good
friday
a
torchlight
procession
takes
place
by
night
from
one
church
to
another
in
which
is
carried
a
large
wooden
image
of
christ
bent
under
the
weight
of
the
cross
the
chief
members
of
the
government
assist
and
the
whole
slowly
moves
to
the
sound
of
muffled
drums
a
double
procession
is
managed
a
few
days
afterwards
the
image
of
mary
is
carried
in
one
direction
and
that
of
the
saviour
in
another
the
two
images
meet
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
churches
which
is
previously
filled
to
excess
with
the
multitudes
anxious
to
witness
the
affecting
meeting
of
mother
and
son
a
few
days
before
the
crucifixion
the
images
are
brought
face
to
face
in
the
middle
of
the
church
the
crowd
falls
prostrate
and
a
lachrymose
sermon
is
delivered
from
the
pulpit
the
whole
thing
as
well
as
many
other
spectacles
arranged
during
the
few
succeeding
days
is
highly
theatrical
and
well
calculated
to
excite
the
religious
emotions
of
the
people
although
perhaps
only
temporarily
on
good
friday
the
bells
do
not
ring
all
musical
sounds
are
interdicted
and
the
hours
night
and
day
are
announced
by
the
dismal
noise
of
wooden
clappers
wielded
by
negroes
stationed
near
the
different
churches
a
sermon
is
delivered
in
each
church
in
the
middle
of
it
a
scroll
is
suddenly
unfolded
from
the
pulpit
upon
which
is
an
exaggerated
picture
of
the
bleeding
christ
this
act
is
accompanied
by
loud
groans
which
come
from
individuals
concealed
in
the
vestry
and
engaged
for
the
purpose
the
priest
becomes
greatly
excited
and
actually
sheds
tears
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
squeezed
myself
into
the
crowd
and
watched
the
effect
of
the
spectacle
on
the
audience
old
portuguese
men
and
brazilian
women
seemed
very
much
affected
sobbing
beating
their
breasts
and
telling
their
beads
the
negroes
themselves
behaved
with
great
propriety
but
seemed
moved
more
particularly
by
the
pomp
the
gilding
the
dresses
and
the
general
display
young
brazilians
laughed
several
aborigines
were
there
coolly
looking
on
one
old
indian
who
was
standing
near
me
said
in
a
derisive
manner
when
the
sermon
was
over
it
all
very
good
better
it
could
not
be
esta
todo
bom
melhor
nao
pude
ser
the
negroes
of
para
are
very
devout
they
have
built
by
slow
degrees
as
i
was
told
a
fine
church
by
their
own
unaided
exertions
it
is
called
nossa
senhora
do
rosario
or
our
lady
of
the
rosary
during
the
first
weeks
of
our
residence
at
para
i
frequently
observed
a
line
of
negroes
and
negresses
late
at
night
marching
along
the
streets
singing
a
chorus
each
carried
on
his
or
her
head
a
quantity
of
building
materials
stones
bricks
mortar
or
planks
i
found
they
were
chiefly
slaves
who
after
their
hard
day
work
were
contributing
a
little
towards
the
construction
of
their
church
the
materials
had
all
been
purchased
by
their
own
savings
the
interior
was
finished
about
a
year
afterwards
and
is
decorated
i
thought
quite
as
superbly
as
the
other
churches
which
were
constructed
with
far
larger
means
by
the
old
religious
orders
more
than
a
century
ago
annually
the
negroes
celebrate
the
festival
of
nossa
senora
de
rosario
and
generally
make
it
a
complete
success
i
will
now
add
a
few
more
notes
which
i
have
accumulated
on
the
subject
of
the
natural
history
and
then
we
shall
have
done
for
the
present
with
para
and
its
neighbourhood
i
have
already
mentioned
that
monkeys
were
rare
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
para
i
met
with
only
three
species
in
the
forest
near
the
city
they
are
shy
animals
and
avoid
the
neighbourhood
of
towns
where
they
are
subject
to
much
persecution
by
the
inhabitants
who
kill
them
for
food
the
only
kind
which
i
saw
frequently
was
the
little
midas
ursulus
one
of
the
marmosets
a
family
peculiar
to
tropical
america
and
differing
in
many
essential
points
of
structure
and
habits
from
all
other
apes
they
are
small
in
size
and
more
like
squirrels
than
true
monkeys
in
their
manner
of
climbing
the
nails
except
those
of
the
hind
thumbs
are
long
and
like
those
of
squirrels
and
the
thumbs
of
the
fore
extremities
or
hands
are
not
opposable
to
the
other
fingers
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
they
have
a
near
relationship
to
squirrels
which
belong
to
the
rodents
an
inferior
order
of
mammals
their
resemblance
to
those
animals
is
merely
a
superficial
one
they
have
two
molar
teeth
less
in
each
jaw
than
the
cebidae
the
other
family
of
american
monkeys
they
agree
with
them
however
in
the
sideway
position
of
the
nostrils
a
character
which
distinguishes
both
from
all
the
monkeys
of
the
old
world
the
body
is
long
and
slender
clothed
with
soft
hairs
and
the
tail
which
is
nearly
twice
the
length
of
the
trunk
is
not
prehensile
the
hind
limbs
are
much
larger
in
volume
than
the
anterior
pair
the
midas
ursulus
is
never
seen
in
large
flocks
three
or
four
is
the
greatest
number
observed
together
it
seems
to
be
less
afraid
of
the
neighbourhood
of
man
than
any
other
monkey
i
sometimes
saw
it
in
the
woods
which
border
the
suburban
streets
and
once
i
espied
two
individuals
in
a
thicket
behind
the
english
consul
house
at
nazareth
its
mode
of
progression
along
the
main
boughs
of
the
lofty
trees
is
like
that
of
the
squirrel
it
does
not
ascend
to
the
slender
branches
or
take
those
wonderful
flying
leaps
which
the
cebidae
do
whose
prehensile
tails
and
flexible
hands
fit
them
for
such
headlong
travelling
it
confines
itself
to
the
larger
boughs
and
trunks
of
trees
the
long
nails
being
of
great
assistance
to
the
creature
enabling
it
to
cling
securely
to
the
bark
and
it
is
often
seen
passing
rapidly
around
the
perpendicular
cylindrical
trunks
it
is
a
quick
restless
timid
little
creature
and
has
a
great
share
of
curiosity
for
when
a
person
passes
by
under
the
trees
along
which
a
flock
is
running
they
always
stop
for
a
few
moments
to
have
a
stare
at
the
intruder
in
para
midas
ursulus
is
often
seen
in
a
tame
state
in
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
when
full
grown
it
is
about
nine
inches
long
independently
of
the
tail
which
measures
fifteen
inches
the
fur
is
thick
and
black
in
colour
with
the
exception
of
a
streak
down
the
middle
of
the
back
when
first
taken
or
when
kept
tied
up
it
is
very
timid
and
irritable
it
will
not
allow
itself
to
be
approached
but
keeps
retreating
backwards
when
any
one
attempts
to
coax
it
it
is
always
in
a
querulous
humour
uttering
a
twittering
complaining
noise
its
dark
watchful
eyes
are
expressive
of
distrust
and
observant
of
every
movement
which
takes
place
near
it
when
treated
kindly
however
as
it
generally
is
in
the
houses
of
the
natives
it
becomes
very
tame
and
familiar
i
once
saw
one
as
playful
as
a
kitten
running
about
the
house
after
the
negro
children
who
fondled
it
to
their
hearts
content
it
acted
somewhat
differently
towards
strangers
and
seemed
not
to
like
them
to
sit
in
the
hammock
which
was
slung
in
the
room
leaping
up
trying
to
bite
and
otherwise
annoying
them
it
is
generally
fed
sweet
fruits
such
as
the
banana
but
it
is
also
fond
of
insects
especially
spiders
and
grasshoppers
which
it
will
snap
up
with
eagerness
when
within
reach
the
expression
of
countenance
in
these
small
monkeys
is
intelligent
and
pleasing
this
is
partly
owing
to
the
open
facial
angle
which
is
given
as
one
of
but
the
quick
movements
of
the
head
and
the
way
they
have
of
inclining
it
to
one
side
when
their
curiosity
is
excited
contribute
very
much
to
give
them
a
knowing
expression
on
the
upper
amazons
i
once
saw
a
tame
individual
of
the
midas
leoninus
a
species
first
described
by
humboldt
which
was
still
more
playful
and
intelligent
than
the
one
just
described
this
rare
and
beautiful
little
monkey
is
only
seven
inches
in
length
exclusive
of
the
tail
it
is
named
leoninus
on
account
of
the
long
brown
mane
which
depends
from
the
neck
and
which
gives
it
very
much
the
appearance
of
a
diminutive
lion
in
the
house
where
it
was
kept
it
was
familiar
with
everyone
its
greatest
pleasure
seeming
to
be
to
climb
about
the
bodies
of
different
persons
who
entered
the
first
time
i
went
in
it
ran
across
the
room
straightway
to
the
chair
on
which
i
had
sat
down
and
climbed
up
to
my
shoulder
having
arrived
there
it
turned
round
and
looked
into
my
face
showing
its
little
teeth
and
chattering
as
though
it
would
say
well
and
how
do
you
do
it
showed
more
affection
towards
its
master
than
towards
strangers
and
would
climb
up
to
his
head
a
dozen
times
in
the
course
of
an
hour
making
a
great
show
every
time
of
searching
there
for
certain
animalcula
isidore
geoffroy
hilaire
relates
of
a
species
of
this
genus
that
it
distinguished
between
different
objects
depicted
on
an
engraving
audouin
showed
it
the
portraits
of
a
cat
and
a
wasp
at
these
it
became
much
terrified
whereas
at
the
sight
of
a
figure
of
a
grasshopper
or
beetle
it
precipitated
itself
on
the
picture
as
if
to
seize
the
objects
there
represented
although
monkeys
are
now
rare
in
a
wild
state
near
para
a
great
number
may
be
seen
in
the
city
the
brazilians
are
fond
of
pet
animals
monkeys
however
have
not
been
known
to
breed
in
captivity
in
this
country
i
counted
in
a
short
time
thirteen
different
species
whilst
walking
about
the
para
streets
either
at
the
doors
or
windows
of
houses
or
in
the
native
canoes
two
of
them
i
did
not
meet
with
afterwards
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
one
of
these
was
the
hapale
jacchus
a
little
creature
resembling
a
kitten
banded
with
black
and
grey
all
over
the
body
and
tail
and
having
a
fringe
of
long
white
hairs
surrounding
the
ears
it
was
seated
on
the
shoulder
of
a
young
mulatto
girl
as
she
was
walking
along
the
street
and
i
was
told
had
been
captured
in
the
island
of
marajo
the
other
was
a
species
of
cebus
with
a
remarkably
large
head
it
had
fur
paler
on
the
face
but
presenting
a
blackish
tuft
on
the
top
of
the
forehead
in
the
wet
season
serpents
are
common
in
the
neighbourhood
of
para
one
morning
in
april
after
a
night
of
deluging
rain
the
lamplighter
on
his
rounds
to
extinguish
the
lamps
woke
me
up
to
show
me
a
he
had
just
killed
in
the
rua
antonio
not
far
from
my
door
he
had
cut
it
nearly
in
two
with
a
large
knife
as
it
was
making
its
way
down
the
sandy
street
sometimes
the
native
hunters
capture
constrictors
alive
in
the
forest
near
the
city
we
bought
one
which
had
been
taken
in
this
way
and
kept
it
for
some
time
in
a
large
box
under
our
verandah
this
is
not
however
the
largest
or
most
formidable
serpent
found
in
the
amazons
region
it
is
far
inferior
in
these
respects
to
the
hideous
sucuruju
or
water
boa
eunectes
murinus
which
sometimes
attacks
man
but
of
this
i
shall
have
to
give
an
account
in
a
subsequent
chapter
it
frequently
happened
in
passing
through
the
thickets
that
a
snake
would
fall
from
the
boughs
close
to
me
once
for
a
few
moments
i
got
completely
entangled
in
the
folds
of
one
a
wonderfully
slender
kind
being
nearly
six
feet
in
length
and
not
more
than
half
an
inch
in
diameter
at
its
broadest
part
it
was
a
species
of
dryophis
the
majority
of
the
snakes
seen
were
innocuous
one
day
however
i
trod
on
the
tail
of
a
young
serpent
belonging
to
a
very
poisonous
kind
the
jararaca
craspedocephalus
atrox
it
turned
round
and
bit
my
trousers
and
a
young
indian
lad
who
was
behind
me
dexterously
cut
it
through
with
his
knife
before
it
had
time
to
free
itself
in
some
seasons
snakes
are
very
abundant
and
it
often
struck
me
as
strange
that
accidents
did
not
occur
more
frequently
than
was
the
case
amongst
the
most
curious
snakes
found
here
were
the
amphisbaenae
a
genus
allied
to
the
of
europe
several
species
occur
at
para
those
brought
to
me
were
generally
not
much
more
than
a
foot
in
length
they
are
of
cylindrical
shape
having
properly
speaking
no
neck
and
the
blunt
tail
which
is
only
about
an
inch
in
length
is
of
the
same
shape
as
the
head
this
peculiar
form
added
to
their
habit
of
wriggling
backwards
as
well
as
forwards
has
given
rise
to
the
fable
that
they
have
two
heads
one
at
each
extremity
they
are
extremely
sluggish
in
their
motions
and
are
clothed
with
scales
that
have
the
form
of
small
imbedded
plates
arranged
in
rings
round
the
body
the
eye
is
so
small
as
to
be
scarcely
perceptible
they
live
habitually
in
the
subterranean
chambers
of
the
sauba
ant
only
coming
out
of
their
abodes
occasionally
in
the
night
time
the
natives
call
the
amphisbaena
the
mai
das
saubas
or
mother
of
the
saubas
and
believe
it
to
be
poisonous
although
it
is
perfectly
harmless
it
is
one
of
the
many
curious
animals
which
have
become
the
subject
of
mythical
stories
with
the
natives
they
say
the
ants
treat
it
with
great
affection
and
that
if
the
snake
be
taken
away
from
a
nest
the
saubas
will
forsake
the
spot
i
once
took
one
quite
whole
out
of
the
body
of
a
young
jararaca
the
poisonous
species
already
alluded
to
whose
body
was
so
distended
with
its
contents
that
the
skin
was
stretched
out
to
a
film
over
the
contained
amphisbaena
i
was
unfortunately
not
able
to
ascertain
the
exact
relation
which
subsists
between
these
curious
snakes
and
the
sauba
ants
i
believe
however
they
feed
upon
the
saubas
for
i
once
found
remains
of
ants
in
the
stomach
of
one
of
them
their
motions
are
quite
peculiar
the
undilatable
jaws
small
eyes
and
curious
plated
integument
also
distinguish
them
from
other
snakes
these
properties
have
evidently
some
relation
to
their
residence
in
the
subterranean
abodes
of
ants
it
is
now
well
ascertained
by
naturalists
that
some
of
the
most
anomalous
forms
amongst
coleopterous
insects
are
those
which
live
solely
in
the
nests
of
ants
and
it
is
curious
that
an
abnormal
form
of
snakes
should
also
be
found
in
the
society
of
these
insects
the
neighbourhood
of
para
is
rich
in
insects
i
do
not
speak
of
the
number
of
individuals
which
is
probably
less
than
one
meets
with
excepting
ants
and
termites
in
summer
days
in
temperate
latitudes
but
the
variety
or
in
other
words
the
number
of
species
is
very
great
it
will
convey
some
idea
of
the
diversity
of
butterflies
when
i
mention
that
about
species
of
that
tribe
are
found
within
an
hour
walk
of
the
town
while
the
total
number
found
in
the
british
islands
does
not
exceed
and
the
whole
of
europe
supports
only
some
of
the
most
showy
species
such
as
the
kinds
papilio
polycaon
thoas
torquatus
and
others
are
seen
flying
about
the
streets
and
gardens
sometimes
they
come
through
the
open
windows
attracted
by
flowers
in
the
apartments
those
species
of
papilio
which
are
most
characteristic
of
the
country
so
conspicuous
in
their
green
and
hues
which
linnaeus
in
pursuance
of
his
elegant
system
of
nomenclature
naming
the
different
kinds
after
the
heroes
of
greek
mythology
called
trojans
never
leave
the
shades
of
the
forest
the
splendid
metallic
blue
morphos
some
of
which
measure
seven
inches
in
expanse
are
generally
confined
to
the
shady
alleys
of
the
forest
they
sometimes
come
forth
into
the
broad
sunlight
when
we
first
went
to
look
at
our
new
residence
in
nazareth
a
morpho
menelaus
one
of
the
most
beautiful
kinds
was
seen
flapping
its
huge
wings
like
a
bird
along
the
verandah
this
species
however
although
much
admired
looks
dull
in
colour
by
the
side
of
its
congener
the
morpho
rhetenor
whose
wings
on
the
upper
face
are
of
quite
a
dazzling
lustre
rhetenor
usually
prefers
the
broad
sunny
roads
in
the
forest
and
is
an
almost
unattainable
prize
on
account
of
its
lofty
flight
for
it
very
rarely
descends
nearer
the
ground
than
about
twenty
feet
when
it
comes
sailing
along
it
occasionally
flaps
its
wings
and
then
the
blue
surface
flashes
in
the
sunlight
so
that
it
is
visible
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
there
is
another
species
of
this
genus
of
a
hue
the
morpho
uraneis
this
is
equally
difficult
to
obtain
the
male
only
has
the
satiny
lustre
the
female
being
of
a
colour
it
is
in
the
height
of
the
dry
season
that
the
greatest
number
and
variety
of
butterflies
are
found
in
the
woods
especially
when
a
shower
falls
at
intervals
of
a
few
days
an
infinite
number
of
curious
and
rare
species
may
then
be
taken
most
diversified
in
habits

colours
and

some
yellow
others
bright
red
green
purple
and
blue
and
many
bordered
or
spangled
with
metallic
lines
and
spots
of
a
silvery
or
golden
lustre
some
have
wings
transparent
as
glass
one
of
these
clear
wings
is
especially
beautiful
namely
the
hetaira
esmeralda
it
has
one
spot
only
of
opaque
colouring
on
its
wings
which
is
of
a
violet
and
rose
hue
this
is
the
only
part
visible
when
the
insect
is
flying
low
over
dead
leaves
in
the
gloomy
shades
where
alone
it
is
found
and
it
then
looks
like
a
wandering
petal
of
a
flower
bees
and
wasps
are
not
especially
numerous
near
para
and
i
will
reserve
an
account
of
their
habits
for
a
future
chapter
many
species
of
mygale
those
monstrous
hairy
spiders
half
a
foot
in
expanse
which
attract
the
attention
so
much
in
museums
are
found
in
sandy
places
at
nazareth
the
different
kinds
have
the
most
diversified
habits
some
construct
amongst
the
tiles
or
thatch
of
houses
dens
of
web
which
in
its
texture
very
much
resembles
fine
muslin
these
are
often
seen
crawling
over
the
walls
of
apartments
others
build
similar
nests
in
trees
and
are
known
to
attack
birds
one
very
robust
fellow
the
mygale
blondii
burrows
into
the
earth
forming
a
broad
slanting
gallery
about
two
feet
long
the
sides
of
which
he
lines
beautifully
with
silk
he
is
nocturnal
in
his
habits
just
before
sunset
he
may
be
seen
keeping
watch
within
the
mouth
of
his
tunnel
disappearing
suddenly
when
he
hears
a
heavy
tread
near
his
hiding
place
the
number
of
spiders
ornamented
with
showy
colours
was
somewhat
remarkable
some
double
themselves
up
at
the
base
of
so
as
to
resemble
and
thus
deceive
the
insects
on
which
they
prey
the
most
spider
was
a
species
of
acrosoma
which
had
two
curved
spines
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
proceeding
from
the
tip
of
its
abdomen
it
spins
a
large
web
the
monstrous
appendages
being
apparently
no
impediment
to
it
in
its
work
but
what
their
use
can
be
i
am
unable
to
divine
coleoptera
or
beetles
at
first
seemed
to
be
very
scarce
this
apparent
scarcity
has
been
noticed
in
other
equatorial
countries
and
arises
probably
from
the
great
heat
of
the
sun
not
permitting
them
to
exist
in
exposed
situations
where
they
form
such
conspicuous
objects
in
europe
many
hundred
species
of
the
different
families
can
be
found
when
they
are
patiently
searched
for
in
the
shady
places
to
which
they
are
confined
it
is
vain
to
look
for
the
geodephaga
or
carnivorous
beetles
under
stones
or
anywhere
indeed
in
open
sunny
places
the
terrestrial
forms
of
this
interesting
family
which
abound
in
england
and
temperate
countries
generally
are
scarce
in
the
neighbourhood
of
para
in
fact
i
met
with
only
four
or
five
species
on
the
other
hand
the
purely
arboreal
kinds
were
rather
numerous
the
contrary
of
this
happens
in
northern
latitudes
where
the
great
majority
of
the
species
and
genera
are
exclusively
terrestrial
the
arboreal
forms
are
distinguished
by
the
structure
of
the
feet
which
have
broad
spongy
soles
and
toothed
claws
enabling
them
to
climb
over
and
cling
to
branches
and
leaves
the
remarkable
scarcity
of
ground
beetles
is
doubtless
attributable
to
the
number
of
ants
and
termites
which
people
every
inch
of
surface
in
all
shady
places
and
which
would
most
likely
destroy
the
larvae
of
coleoptera
moreover
these
active
creatures
have
the
same
functions
as
coleoptera
and
thus
render
their
existence
unnecessary
the
large
proportion
of
climbing
forms
of
carnivorous
beetles
is
an
interesting
fact
because
it
affords
another
instance
of
the
arboreal
character
which
animal
forms
tend
to
assume
in
equinoctial
america
a
circumstance
which
points
to
the
slow
adaptation
of
the
fauna
to
a
country

an
immense

feet
long
with
a
flat
prow
and
great
breadth
of
beam
and
fitted
to
live
in
heavy
seas
for
although
our
voyage
was
only
a
river
trip
there
were
vast
expanses
of
water
to
traverse
it
was
not
decked
over
but
had
two
arched
awnings
formed
of
strong
wickerwork
and
thatched
with
palm
leaves
we
then
had
to
store
it
with
provisions
for
three
months
the
time
we
at
first
intended
to
be
away
procure
the
necessary
passports
and
lastly
engage
a
crew
leavens
having
had
much
experience
in
the
country
managed
all
these
matters
he
brought
two
indians
from
the
and
these
induced
another
to
enroll
himself
we
on
our
parts
took
our
cook
isidoro
and
a
young
indian
lad
named
antonio
who
had
attached
himself
to
us
in
the
course
of
our
residence
at
nazareth
our
principal
man
was
alexandro
one
of
indians
he
was
an
intelligent
and
young
tapuyo
an
expert
sailor
and
an
indefatigable
hunter
to
his
fidelity
we
were
indebted
for
being
enabled
to
carry
out
any
of
the
objects
of
our
voyage
being
a
native
of
a
district
near
the
capital
alexandro
was
a
civilised
tapuyo
a
citizen
as
free
as
his
white
neighbours
he
spoke
only
portuguese
he
was
a
man
rather
under
the
middle
height
with
fine
regular
features
and
what
was
unusual
in
indians
the
upper
lip
decorated
with
a
moustache
three
years
afterwards
i
saw
him
at
para
in
the
uniform
of
the
national
guard
and
he
called
on
me
often
to
talk
about
old
times
i
esteemed
him
as
a
quiet
sensible
manly
young
fellow
we
set
sail
in
the
evening
after
waiting
several
hours
in
vain
for
one
of
our
crew
it
was
soon
dark
the
wind
blew
stiffly
and
the
tide
rushed
along
with
great
rapidity
carrying
us
swiftly
past
the
crowd
of
vessels
which
were
anchored
in
the
port
the
canoe
rolled
a
good
deal
after
we
had
made
five
or
six
miles
of
way
the
tide
turned
and
we
were
obliged
to
cast
anchor
not
long
after
we
lay
ourselves
down
all
three
together
on
the
mat
which
was
spread
over
the
floor
of
our
cabin
and
soon
fell
asleep
on
awaking
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
we
found
ourselves
gliding
upwards
with
the
tide
along
the
bahia
or
bay
as
it
is
called
of
goajara
this
is
a
broad
channel
lying
between
the
mainland
and
a
line
of
islands
which
extends
some
distance
beyond
the
city
into
it
three
large
rivers
discharge
their
waters
namely
the
guama
the
acara
and
the
moju
so
that
it
forms
a
kind
of
within
the
grand
estuary
of
para
it
is
nearly
four
miles
broad
the
left
bank
along
which
we
were
now
sailing
was
beautiful
in
the
extreme
not
an
inch
of
soil
was
to
be
seen
the
water
frontage
presented
a
compact
wall
of
rich
and
varied
forest
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
it
seemed
to
form
a
finished
border
to
the
water
scene
where
the
rounded
shapes
of
exogenous
trees
which
constituted
the
mass
formed
the
groundwork
and
the
endless
diversity
of
heliconiae
and
palms
each
kind
differing
in
stem
crown
and
fronds
the
rich
embroidery
the
morning
was
calm
and
cloudless
and
the
slanting
beams
of
the
early
sun
striking
full
on
the
front
of
the
forest
lighted
up
the
whole
most
gloriously
the
only
sound
of
life
which
reached
us
was
the
call
of
the
serracura
gallinula
cayennensis
a
kind
of
all
else
was
so
still
that
the
voices
of
boatmen
could
be
plainly
heard
from
canoes
passing
a
mile
or
two
distant
from
us
the
sun
soon
gains
great
power
on
the
water
but
with
it
the
increases
in
strength
moderating
the
heat
which
would
otherwise
be
almost
insupportable
we
reached
the
end
of
the
goajara
about
midday
and
then
entered
the
narrower
channel
of
the
moju
up
this
we
travelled
partly
rowing
and
partly
sailing
between
the
same
unbroken
walls
of
forest
until
the
morning
of
the
august
the
moju
a
stream
slightly
inferior
to
the
thames
in
size
is
connected
about
twenty
miles
from
its
mouth
by
means
of
a
short
artificial
canal
with
a
small
stream
the
mirim
which
flows
the
opposite
way
into
the
of
the
tocantins
small
vessels
like
ours
take
this
route
in
preference
to
the
stormy
passage
by
way
of
the
main
river
although
the
distance
is
considerably
greater
we
passed
through
the
canal
yesterday
and
today
have
been
threading
our
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
narrow
channels
their
banks
all
clothed
with
the
same
magnificent
forest
but
agreeably
varied
by
houses
of
planters
and
settlers
we
passed
many
quite
large
establishments
besides
one
pretty
little
village
called
santa
anna
all
these
channels
are
washed
through
by
the
tides
the
ebb
contrary
to
what
takes
place
in
the
short
canal
setting
towards
the
tocantins
the
water
is
almost
tepid
fahr
and
the
rank
vegetation
all
around
seems
reeking
with
moisture
the
country
however
as
we
were
told
is
perfectly
healthy
some
of
the
houses
are
built
on
wooden
piles
driven
into
the
mud
of
the
swamp
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
end
of
the
last
channel
called
the
murut
ipucu
which
runs
for
several
miles
between
two
unbroken
lines
of
palms
forming
colossal
palisades
with
their
straight
stems
on
rounding
a
point
of
land
we
came
in
full
view
of
the
tocantins
the
event
was
announced
by
one
of
our
indians
who
was
on
the
lookout
at
the
prow
shouting
la
esta
o
behold
the
great
river
it
was
a
grand
broad
expanse
of
dark
waters
dancing
merrily
to
the
breeze
the
opposite
shore
a
narrow
blue
line
miles
away
we
went
ashore
on
an
island
covered
with
palm
trees
to
make
a
fire
and
boil
our
kettle
for
tea
i
wandered
a
short
way
inland
and
was
astounded
at
the
prospect
the
land
lay
below
the
upper
level
of
the
daily
tides
so
that
there
was
no
underwood
and
the
ground
was
bare
the
trees
were
almost
all
of
one
species
of
palm
the
gigantic
mauritia
flexuosa
only
on
the
borders
was
there
a
small
number
of
a
second
kind
the
equally
remarkable
ubussu
palm
manicaria
saccifera
the
ubussu
has
erect
uncut
leaves
feet
long
and
six
feet
wide
all
arranged
round
the
top
of
a
high
stem
so
as
to
form
a
figure
like
that
of
a
colossal
shuttlecock
the
palms
which
clothed
nearly
the
entire
islet
had
huge
cylindrical
smooth
stems
three
feet
in
diameter
and
about
a
hundred
feet
high
the
crowns
were
formed
of
enormous
clusters
of
leaves
the
stalks
alone
of
which
measured
seven
to
ten
feet
in
length
nothing
in
the
vegetable
world
could
be
more
imposing
than
this
grove
of
palms
there
was
no
underwood
to
obstruct
the
view
of
the
long
perspective
of
towering
columns
the
crowns
which
were
densely
packed
together
at
an
immense
height
overhead
shut
out
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
gloomy
solitude
beneath
through
which
the
sound
of
our
voices
seemed
to
reverberate
could
be
compared
to
nothing
so
well
as
a
solemn
temple
the
fruits
of
the
two
palms
were
scattered
over
the
ground
those
of
the
ubussu
adhere
together
by
twos
and
threes
and
have
a
rough
shell
the
fruit
of
the
mauritia
on
the
contrary
is
of
a
bright
red
hue
and
the
skin
is
impressed
with
lines
which
give
it
a
resemblance
to
a
quilted
about
midnight
the
tide
being
favourable
and
the
breeze
strong
we
crossed
the
river
taking
it
in
a
slanting
direction
a
distance
of
sixteen
miles
and
arrived
at
eight
the
following
morning
at
cameta
this
is
a
town
of
some
importance
pleasantly
situated
on
the
somewhat
high
terra
firma
of
the
left
bank
of
the
tocantins
i
will
defer
giving
an
account
of
the
place
till
the
end
of
this
narrative
of
our
tocantins
voyage
we
lost
here
another
of
our
men
who
got
drinking
with
some
old
companions
ashore
and
were
obliged
to
start
on
the
difficult
journey
up
the
river
with
two
hands
only
and
they
in
a
very
dissatisfied
humour
with
the
prospect
the
river
view
from
cameta
is
magnificent
the
town
is
situated
as
already
mentioned
on
a
high
bank
which
forms
quite
a
considerable
elevation
for
this
flat
country
and
the
broad
expanse
of
waters
is
studded
with
low
islands
the
prospect
down
river
however
being
clear
or
bounded
only
by
a
horizon
of
water
and
sky
the
shores
are
washed
by
the
waters
into
little
bays
and
creeks
fringed
with
sandy
beaches
the
tocantins
has
been
likened
by
prince
adalbert
of
prussia
who
crossed
its
mouth
in
to
the
ganges
it
is
upwards
of
ten
miles
in
breadth
at
its
mouth
opposite
cameta
it
is
five
miles
broad
burchell
the
english
traveller
descended
the
river
from
the
mining
provinces
of
interior
brazil
some
years
before
our
visit
unfortunately
the
utility
of
this
fine
stream
is
impaired
by
the
numerous
obstructions
to
its
navigation
in
the
shape
of
cataracts
and
rapids
which
commence
in
ascending
at
about
miles
above
cameta
as
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
august
arrived
in
company
with
senor
laroque
an
intelligent
portuguese
merchant
at
vista
alegre
fifteen
miles
above
cameta
this
was
the
residence
of
senor
antonio
ferreira
gomez
and
was
a
fair
sample
of
a
brazilian
establishment
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
buildings
covered
a
wide
space
the
being
separated
from
the
place
of
business
and
as
both
were
built
on
low
flooded
ground
the
communication
between
the
two
was
by
means
of
a
long
wooden
bridge
from
the
office
and
visitors
apartments
a
wooden
pier
extended
into
the
river
the
whole
was
raised
on
piles
above
the
mark
there
was
a
rude
mill
for
grinding
worked
by
bullocks
but
cashaca
or
rum
was
the
only
article
manufactured
from
the
juice
behind
the
buildings
was
a
small
piece
of
ground
cleared
from
the
forest
and
planted
with
fruit
trees
orange
lemon
genipapa
goyava
and
others
and
beyond
this
a
broad
path
through
a
neglected
plantation
of
coffee
and
cacao
led
to
several
large
sheds
where
the
farinha
or
mandioca
meal
was
manufactured
the
plantations
of
mandioca
are
always
scattered
about
in
the
forest
some
of
them
being
on
islands
in
the
middle
of
the
river
land
being
plentiful
and
the
plough
as
well
as
indeed
nearly
all
other
agricultural
implements
unknown
the
same
ground
is
not
planted
three
years
together
but
a
new
piece
of
forest
is
cleared
every
alternate
year
and
the
old
clearing
suffered
to
relapse
into
jungle
we
stayed
here
two
days
sleeping
ashore
in
the
apartment
devoted
to
strangers
as
usual
in
brazilian
houses
of
the
middle
class
we
were
not
introduced
to
the
female
members
of
the
family
and
indeed
saw
nothing
of
them
except
at
a
distance
in
the
forest
and
thickets
about
the
place
we
were
tolerably
successful
in
collecting
finding
a
number
of
birds
and
insects
which
do
not
occur
at
para
i
saw
here
for
the
first
time
the
chatterer
ampelis
cotinga
it
was
on
the
topmost
bough
of
a
very
lofty
tree
and
completely
out
of
the
reach
of
an
ordinary
the
beautiful
colour
of
its
plumage
was
plainly
discernible
at
that
distance
it
is
a
dull
quiet
bird
a
much
commoner
species
was
the
cigana
or
gipsy
opisthocomus
cristatus
a
bird
belonging
to
the
same
order
gallinacea
as
our
domestic
fowl
it
is
about
the
size
of
a
pheasant
the
plumage
is
dark
brown
varied
with
reddish
and
the
head
is
adorned
with
a
crest
of
long
feathers
it
is
a
remarkable
bird
in
many
respects
the
hind
toe
is
not
placed
high
above
the
level
of
the
other
toes
as
it
is
in
the
fowl
order
generally
but
lies
on
the
same
plane
with
them
the
shape
of
the
foot
becomes
thus
suited
to
the
purely
arboreal
habits
of
the
bird
enabling
it
to
grasp
firmly
the
branches
of
trees
this
is
a
distinguishing
character
of
all
the
birds
in
equinoctial
america
which
represents
the
fowl
and
pheasant
tribes
of
the
old
world
and
affords
another
proof
of
the
adaptation
of
the
fauna
to
a
forest
region
the
cigana
lives
in
considerable
flocks
on
the
lower
trees
and
bushes
bordering
the
streams
and
lagoons
and
feeds
on
various
wild
fruits
especially
the
sour
goyava
psidium
sp
the
natives
say
it
devours
the
fruit
of
arborescent
arums
caladium
arborescens
which
grow
in
crowded
masses
around
the
swampy
banks
of
lagoons
its
voice
is
a
harsh
grating
hiss
it
makes
the
noise
when
alarmed
or
when
disturbed
by
passing
canoes
all
the
individuals
sibilating
as
they
fly
heavily
away
from
tree
to
tree
it
is
polygamous
like
other
members
of
the
same
order
it
is
never
however
by
any
chance
seen
on
the
ground
and
is
nowhere
domesticated
the
flesh
has
an
unpleasant
odour
of
musk
combined
with
wet
hides
a
smell
called
by
the
brazilians
catinga
it
is
therefore
uneatable
if
it
be
as
unpalatable
to
carnivorous
animals
as
it
is
to
man
the
immunity
from
persecution
which
it
would
thereby
enjoy
would
account
for
its
existing
in
such
great
numbers
throughout
the
country
we
lost
another
of
our
crew
here
and
thus
at
the
commencement
of
our
voyage
had
before
us
the
prospect
of
being
forced
to
return
from
sheer
want
of
hands
to
manage
the
canoe
senor
gomez
to
whom
we
had
brought
letters
of
introduction
from
senor
joao
augusto
correia
a
brazilian
gentlemen
of
high
standing
at
para
tried
what
he
could
do
to
induce
the
of
his
neighbourhood
to
engage
with
us
but
it
was
a
vain
endeavour
the
people
of
these
parts
seemed
to
be
above
working
for
wages
they
are
naturally
indolent
and
besides
have
all
some
little
business
or
plantation
of
their
own
which
gives
them
a
livelihood
with
independence
it
is
difficult
to
obtain
hands
under
any
circumstances
but
it
was
particularly
so
in
our
case
from
being
foreigners
and
suspected
as
was
natural
amongst
ignorant
people
of
being
strange
in
our
habits
at
length
our
host
lent
us
two
of
his
slaves
to
help
us
on
another
stage
namely
to
the
village
of
baiao
where
we
had
great
hopes
of
having
this
our
urgent
want
supplied
by
the
military
commandant
of
the
district
september
the
distance
from
vista
alegre
to
baiao
is
about
miles
we
had
but
little
wind
and
our
men
were
therefore
obliged
to
row
the
greater
part
of
the
way
the
oars
used
in
such
canoes
as
ours
are
made
by
tying
a
stout
paddle
to
the
end
of
a
long
pole
by
means
of
woody
lianas
the
men
take
their
stand
on
a
raised
deck
formed
by
a
few
rough
planks
placed
over
the
arched
covering
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
and
pull
with
their
backs
to
the
stern
we
started
at
six
and
about
sunset
reached
a
point
where
the
west
channel
of
the
river
along
which
we
had
been
travelling
since
we
left
cameta
joined
a
broader
middle
one
and
formed
with
it
a
great
expanse
of
water
the
islands
here
seem
to
form
two
pretty
regular
lines
dividing
the
great
river
into
three
channels
as
we
progressed
slowly
we
took
the
montaria
and
went
ashore
from
time
to
time
to
the
houses
which
were
numerous
on
the
river
banks
as
well
as
on
the
larger
islands
in
low
situations
they
had
a
very
unfinished
appearance
being
mere
frameworks
raised
high
on
wooden
piles
and
thatched
with
the
leaves
of
the
ubussu
palm
in
their
construction
another
palm
tree
is
made
much
use
of
the
assai
euterpe
oleracea
the
outer
part
of
the
stem
of
this
species
is
hard
and
tough
as
horn
it
is
split
into
narrow
planks
and
these
form
a
great
portion
of
the
walls
and
flooring
the
residents
told
us
that
the
western
channel
becomes
nearly
dry
in
the
middle
of
the
fine
season
but
that
at
high
water
in
april
and
may
the
river
rises
to
the
level
of
the
house
floors
the
river
bottom
is
everywhere
sandy
and
the
country
perfectly
healthy
the
people
seemed
to
all
be
contented
and
happy
but
idleness
and
poverty
were
exhibited
by
many
unmistakeable
signs
as
to
the
flooding
of
their
island
abodes
they
did
not
seem
to
care
about
that
at
all
they
seem
to
be
almost
amphibious
or
as
much
at
home
on
the
water
as
on
land
it
was
really
quite
alarming
to
see
men
and
women
and
children
in
little
leaky
canoes
laden
to
the
with
bag
and
baggage
crossing
broad
reaches
of
river
most
of
them
have
houses
also
on
the
terra
firma
and
reside
in
the
cool
palm
swamps
of
the
ygapo
islands
as
they
are
called
only
in
the
hot
and
dry
season
they
live
chiefly
on
fish
shellfish
amongst
which
were
large
ampullariae
whose
flesh
i
found
on
trial
to
be
a
very
tough
morsel
the
never
failing
farinha
and
the
fruits
of
the
forest
among
the
latter
the
fruits
of
palm
trees
occupied
the
chief
place
the
assai
is
the
most
in
use
but
this
forms
a
universal
article
of
diet
in
all
parts
of
the
country
the
fruit
which
is
perfectly
round
and
about
the
size
of
a
cherry
contains
but
a
small
portion
of
pulp
lying
between
the
skin
and
the
hard
kernel
this
is
made
with
the
addition
of
water
into
a
thick
beverage
which
stains
the
lips
like
blackberries
the
fruit
of
the
miriti
is
also
a
common
article
of
food
although
the
pulp
is
sour
and
unpalatable
at
least
to
european
tastes
it
is
boiled
and
then
eaten
with
farinha
the
tucuma
astrocaryum
tucuma
and
the
mucuja
acrocomia
lasiospatha
grow
only
on
the
mainland
their
fruits
yield
a
yellowish
fibrous
pulp
which
the
natives
eat
in
the
same
way
as
the
miriti
they
contain
so
much
fatty
matter
that
vultures
and
dogs
devour
them
greedily
early
on
the
morning
of
september
we
reached
the
right
or
eastern
bank
which
is
forty
to
sixty
feet
high
at
this
point
the
houses
were
more
substantially
built
than
those
we
had
hitherto
seen
we
succeeded
in
buying
a
small
turtle
most
of
the
inhabitants
had
a
few
of
these
animals
which
they
kept
in
little
enclosures
made
with
stakes
the
people
were
of
the
same
class
everywhere
mamelucos
they
were
very
civil
we
were
not
able
however
to
purchase
much
fresh
food
from
them
i
think
this
was
owing
to
their
really
not
having
more
than
was
absolutely
required
to
satisfy
their
own
needs
in
these
districts
where
the
people
depend
solely
on
fishing
for
animal
food
there
is
a
period
of
the
year
when
they
suffer
hunger
so
that
they
are
disposed
to
highly
prize
a
small
stock
when
they
have
it
they
generally
answered
in
the
negative
when
we
asked
money
in
hand
whether
they
had
fowls
turtles
or
eggs
to
sell
nao
ha
sinto
que
nao
posso
lhe
ser
bom
or
nao
ha
men
coracao
we
have
none
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
oblige
you
or
there
is
none
my
heart
to
at
eight
we
arrived
at
baiao
which
is
built
on
a
very
high
bank
and
contains
about
inhabitants
we
had
to
climb
to
the
village
up
a
ladder
which
is
fixed
against
the
bank
and
on
arriving
at
the
top
took
possession
of
a
room
which
senhor
seixas
had
given
orders
to
be
prepared
for
us
he
himself
was
away
at
his
sitio
and
would
not
be
here
until
the
next
day
we
were
now
quite
dependent
upon
him
for
men
to
enable
us
to
continue
our
voyage
and
so
had
no
remedy
but
to
wait
his
leisure
the
situation
of
the
place
and
the
nature
of
the
woods
around
it
promised
well
for
novelties
in
birds
and
insects
so
we
had
no
reason
to
be
vexed
at
the
delay
but
brought
our
apparatus
and
up
from
the
canoe
and
set
to
work
the
easy
lounging
life
of
the
people
amused
us
very
much
i
afterwards
had
plenty
of
time
to
become
used
to
tropical
village
life
there
is
a
free
familiar
publico
style
of
living
in
these
small
places
which
requires
some
time
for
a
european
to
fall
into
no
sooner
were
we
established
in
our
rooms
than
a
number
of
lazy
young
fellows
came
to
look
on
and
make
remarks
and
we
had
to
answer
all
sorts
of
questions
the
houses
have
their
doors
and
windows
open
to
the
street
and
people
walk
in
and
out
as
they
please
there
is
always
however
a
more
secluded
apartment
where
the
female
members
of
the
families
reside
in
their
familiarity
there
is
nothing
intentionally
offensive
and
it
is
practised
simply
in
the
desire
to
be
civil
and
sociable
a
young
mameluco
named
soares
an
escrivao
or
public
clerk
took
me
into
his
house
to
show
me
his
library
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
a
number
of
latin
classics
virgil
terence
cicero
epistles
and
livy
i
was
not
familiar
enough
at
this
early
period
of
my
residence
in
the
country
with
portuguese
to
converse
freely
with
senhor
scares
or
ascertain
what
use
he
made
of
these
books
it
was
an
unexpected
sight
a
classical
library
in
a
and
hut
on
the
banks
of
the
tocantins
the
prospect
from
the
village
was
magnificent
over
the
green
wooded
islands
far
away
to
the
grey
line
of
forest
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
tocantins
we
were
now
well
out
of
the
low
alluvial
country
of
the
amazons
proper
and
the
climate
was
evidently
much
drier
than
it
is
near
para
they
had
had
no
rain
here
for
many
weeks
and
the
atmosphere
was
hazy
around
the
horizon
so
much
so
that
the
sun
before
setting
glared
like
a
globe
at
para
this
never
happens
the
stars
and
sun
are
as
clear
and
sharply
defined
when
they
peep
above
the
distant
treetops
as
they
are
at
the
zenith
this
beautiful
transparency
of
the
air
arises
doubtless
from
the
equal
distribution
through
it
of
invisible
vapour
i
shall
ever
remember
in
one
of
my
voyages
along
the
para
river
the
grand
spectacle
that
was
once
presented
at
sunrise
our
vessel
was
a
large
schooner
and
we
were
bounding
along
before
a
spanking
breeze
which
tossed
the
waters
into
foam
as
the
day
dawned
so
clear
was
the
air
that
the
lower
rim
of
the
full
moon
remained
sharply
defined
until
it
touched
the
western
horizon
while
at
the
same
time
the
sun
rose
in
the
east
the
two
great
orbs
were
visible
at
the
same
time
and
the
passage
from
the
moonlit
night
to
day
was
so
gentle
that
it
seemed
to
be
only
the
brightening
of
dull
weather
the
woods
around
baiao
were
of
second
growth
the
ground
having
been
formerly
cultivated
a
great
number
of
coffee
and
cotton
trees
grew
amongst
the
thickets
a
fine
woodland
pathway
extends
for
miles
over
the
high
undulating
bank
leading
from
one
house
to
another
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
went
into
several
of
them
and
talked
to
their
inmates
they
were
all
poor
people
the
men
were
out
fishing
some
far
away
a
distance
of
many
days
journey
the
women
plant
mandioca
make
the
farinha
spin
and
weave
cotton
manufacture
soap
of
burnt
cacao
shells
and
andiroba
oil
and
follow
various
other
domestic
employments
i
asked
why
they
allowed
their
plantations
to
run
to
waste
they
said
that
it
was
useless
trying
to
plant
anything
hereabout
the
sauba
ant
devoured
the
young
coffee
trees
and
everyone
who
attempted
to
contend
against
this
universal
ravager
was
sure
to
be
defeated
the
country
for
many
miles
along
the
banks
of
the
river
seemed
to
be
well
peopled
the
inhabitants
were
nearly
all
of
the
white
mameluco
class
i
saw
a
good
many
mulattos
but
very
few
negroes
and
indians
and
none
that
could
be
called
pure
whites
when
senor
seixas
arrived
he
acted
very
kindly
he
provided
us
at
once
with
two
men
killed
an
ox
in
our
honour
and
treated
us
altogether
with
great
consideration
we
were
not
however
introduced
to
his
family
i
caught
a
glimpse
once
of
his
wife
a
pretty
little
mameluco
woman
as
she
was
tripping
with
a
young
girl
whom
i
supposed
to
be
her
daughter
across
the
backyard
both
wore
long
made
of
calico
print
and
had
long
wooden
in
their
mouths
the
room
in
which
we
slept
and
worked
had
formerly
served
as
a
storeroom
for
cacao
and
at
night
i
was
kept
awake
for
hours
by
rats
and
cockroaches
which
swarm
in
all
such
places
the
latter
were
running
about
all
over
the
walls
now
and
then
one
would
come
suddenly
with
a
whirr
full
at
my
face
and
get
under
my
shirt
if
i
attempted
to
jerk
it
off
as
to
the
rats
they
were
chasing
one
another
by
the
dozens
all
night
long
over
the
floor
up
and
down
the
edges
of
the
doors
and
along
the
rafters
of
the
open
roof
september
we
started
from
baiao
at
an
early
hour
one
of
our
new
men
was
a
willing
young
mulatto
named
jose
the
other
was
a
sulky
indian
called
manoel
who
seemed
to
have
been
pressed
into
our
service
against
his
will
senor
seixas
on
parting
sent
a
quantity
of
fresh
provisions
on
board
a
few
miles
above
baiao
the
channel
became
very
shallow
we
ran
aground
several
times
and
the
men
had
to
disembark
and
shove
the
vessel
off
alexandro
shot
several
fine
fish
here
with
bow
and
arrow
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
fish
captured
in
this
way
the
arrow
is
a
reed
with
a
steel
barbed
point
which
is
fixed
in
a
hole
at
the
end
and
secured
by
fine
twine
made
from
the
fibres
of
pineapple
leaves
it
is
only
in
the
clearest
water
that
fish
can
be
thus
shot
and
the
only
skill
required
is
to
make
in
taking
aim
the
proper
allowance
for
refraction
the
next
day
before
sunrise
a
fine
breeze
sprang
up
and
the
men
awoke
and
set
the
sails
we
glided
all
day
through
channels
between
islands
with
long
white
sandy
beaches
over
which
now
and
then
aquatic
and
wading
birds
were
seen
running
the
forest
was
low
and
had
a
harsh
dry
aspect
several
palm
trees
grew
here
which
we
had
not
before
seen
on
low
bushes
near
the
water
pretty
tanagers
tanagra
gularis
were
numerous
flitting
about
and
chirping
like
sparrows
about
four
we
brought
to
at
the
mouth
of
a
creek
or
channel
where
there
was
a
great
extent
of
sandy
beach
the
sand
had
been
blown
by
the
wind
into
ridges
and
undulations
and
over
the
more
moist
parts
large
flocks
of
sandpipers
were
running
about
alexandro
and
i
had
a
long
ramble
over
the
rolling
plain
which
came
as
an
agreeable
change
after
the
monotonous
forest
scenery
amid
which
we
had
been
so
long
travelling
he
pointed
out
to
me
the
tracks
of
a
huge
jaguar
on
the
sand
we
found
here
also
our
first
turtle
nest
and
obtained
eggs
from
it
which
were
laid
at
a
depth
of
nearly
two
feet
from
the
surface
the
mother
first
excavating
a
hole
and
afterwards
covering
it
up
with
sand
the
place
is
discoverable
only
by
following
the
tracks
of
the
turtle
from
the
water
i
saw
here
an
alligator
for
the
first
time
which
reared
its
head
and
shoulders
above
the
water
just
after
i
had
taken
a
bath
near
the
spot
the
night
was
calm
and
cloudless
and
we
employed
the
hours
before
bedtime
in
angling
by
moonlight
on
the
we
reached
a
small
settlement
called
patos
consisting
of
about
a
dozen
houses
and
built
on
a
high
rocky
bank
on
the
eastern
shore
the
rock
is
the
same
nodular
conglomerate
which
is
found
at
so
many
places
from
the
seacoast
to
a
distance
of
miles
up
the
amazons
leavens
made
a
last
attempt
here
to
engage
men
to
accompany
us
to
the
araguaya
but
it
was
in
vain
not
a
soul
could
be
induced
by
any
amount
of
wages
to
go
on
such
an
expedition
the
reports
as
to
the
existence
of
cedar
were
very
vague
all
said
that
the
tree
was
plentiful
somewhere
but
no
one
could
fix
on
the
precise
locality
i
believe
that
the
cedar
grows
like
all
other
forest
trees
in
a
scattered
way
and
not
in
masses
anywhere
the
fact
of
its
being
the
principal
tree
observed
floating
down
with
the
current
of
the
amazons
is
to
be
explained
by
its
wood
being
much
lighter
than
that
of
the
majority
of
trees
when
the
banks
are
washed
away
by
currents
trees
of
all
species
fall
into
the
river
but
the
heavier
ones
which
are
the
most
numerous
sink
and
the
lighter
such
as
the
cedar
alone
float
down
to
the
sea
leavens
was
told
that
there
were
cedar
trees
at
trocara
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
near
some
fine
rounded
hills
covered
with
forest
visible
from
patos
so
there
we
went
we
found
here
several
families
encamped
in
a
delightful
spot
the
shore
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
water
and
was
shaded
by
a
few
trees
there
was
no
underwood
a
great
number
of
hammocks
were
seen
slung
between
the
tree
trunks
and
the
litter
of
a
numerous
household
lay
scattered
about
women
old
and
young
some
of
the
latter
very
and
a
large
number
of
children
besides
pet
animals
enlivened
the
encampment
they
were
all
simple
people
and
explained
to
us
that
they
were
inhabitants
of
cameta
who
had
come
thus
far
eighty
miles
to
spend
the
summer
months
the
only
motive
they
could
give
for
coming
was
that
it
was
so
hot
in
the
town
in
the
verao
summer
and
they
were
all
so
fond
of
fresh
fish
thus
these
simple
folks
think
nothing
of
leaving
home
and
business
to
come
on
a
three
months
picnic
it
is
the
annual
custom
of
this
class
of
people
throughout
the
province
to
spend
a
few
months
of
the
fine
season
in
the
wilder
parts
of
the
country
they
carry
with
them
all
the
farinha
they
can
scrape
together
this
being
the
only
article
of
food
necessary
to
provide
the
men
hunt
and
fish
for
the
day
wants
and
sometimes
collect
a
little
salsaparilla
or
copaiba
oil
to
sell
to
traders
on
their
return
the
women
assist
in
paddling
the
canoes
do
the
cooking
and
sometimes
fish
with
rod
and
line
the
weather
is
enjoyable
the
whole
time
and
so
days
and
weeks
pass
happily
away
one
of
the
men
volunteered
to
walk
with
us
into
the
forest
and
show
us
a
few
cedar
trees
we
passed
through
a
mile
or
two
of
spiny
thickets
and
at
length
came
upon
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
trocara
which
flows
over
a
stony
bed
and
about
a
mile
above
its
mouth
falls
over
a
ledge
of
rocks
thus
forming
a
very
pretty
cascade
in
the
neighbourhood
we
found
a
number
of
specimens
of
a
curious
a
large
flat
helix
with
a
labyrinthine
mouth
anastoma
we
learned
afterwards
that
it
was
a
species
which
had
been
discovered
a
few
years
previously
by
gardner
the
botanist
on
the
upper
part
of
the
tocantins
we
saw
here
for
the
first
time
the
splendid
hyacinthine
macaw
macrocercus
hyacinthinus
the
araruna
of
the
natives
one
of
the
finest
and
rarest
species
of
the
parrot
family
it
only
occurs
in
the
interior
of
brazil
from
lat
to
the
southern
border
of
the
amazons
valley
it
is
three
feet
long
from
the
beak
to
the
tip
of
the
tail
and
is
entirely
of
a
soft
hyacinthine
blue
colour
except
round
the
eyes
where
the
skin
is
naked
and
white
it
flies
in
pairs
and
feeds
on
the
hard
nuts
of
several
palms
but
especially
of
the
mucuja
acrocomia
lasiospatha
these
nuts
which
are
so
hard
as
to
be
difficult
to
break
with
a
heavy
hammer
are
crushed
to
a
pulp
by
the
powerful
beak
of
this
macaw
leavens
was
thoroughly
disgusted
with
the
people
of
patos
two
men
had
come
from
below
with
the
intention
i
believe
of
engaging
with
us
but
they
now
declined
the
inspector
constable
or
governor
of
the
place
appeared
to
be
a
very
slippery
customer
and
i
fancy
discouraged
the
men
from
going
whilst
making
a
great
show
of
forwarding
our
views
these
outlying
settlements
are
the
resort
of
a
number
of
idle
worthless
characters
there
was
a
kind
of
festival
going
on
and
the
people
fuddled
themselves
with
cashiri
an
intoxicating
drink
invented
by
the
indians
it
is
made
by
soaking
mandioca
cakes
in
water
until
fermentation
takes
place
and
tastes
like
new
beer
being
unable
to
obtain
men
leavens
now
gave
up
his
project
of
ascending
the
river
as
far
as
the
araguaya
he
assented
to
our
request
however
to
ascend
to
the
cataracts
near
arroyos
we
started
therefore
from
patos
with
a
more
definite
aim
before
us
than
we
had
hitherto
the
river
became
more
picturesque
as
we
advanced
the
water
was
very
low
it
being
now
the
height
of
the
dry
reason
the
islands
were
smaller
than
those
further
down
and
some
of
them
were
high
and
rocky
bold
wooded
bluffs
projected
into
the
stream
and
all
the
shores
were
fringed
with
beaches
of
glistening
white
sand
on
one
side
of
the
river
there
was
an
extensive
grassy
plain
or
campo
with
isolated
patches
of
trees
scattered
over
it
on
the
and
following
day
we
stopped
several
times
to
ramble
ashore
our
longest
excursion
was
to
a
large
shallow
lagoon
choked
up
with
aquatic
plants
which
lay
about
two
miles
across
the
campo
at
a
place
called
juquerapua
we
engaged
a
pilot
to
conduct
us
to
arroyos
and
a
few
miles
above
the
pilot
house
arrived
at
a
point
where
it
was
not
possible
to
advance
further
in
our
large
canoe
on
account
of
the
rapids
september
embarked
at
six
in
a
large
montaria
which
had
been
lent
to
us
for
this
part
of
our
voyage
by
senor
seixas
leaving
the
vigilinga
anchored
close
to
a
rocky
islet
named
santa
anna
to
await
our
return
isidoro
was
left
in
charge
and
we
were
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
leave
behind
also
our
mulatto
jose
who
had
fallen
ill
since
leaving
baiao
we
had
then
remaining
only
alexandro
manoel
and
the
pilot
a
sturdy
tapuyo
named
joaquim
scarcely
a
sufficient
crew
to
paddle
against
the
strong
currents
at
ten
we
arrived
at
the
first
rapids
which
are
called
tapaiunaquara
the
river
which
was
here
about
a
mile
wide
was
choked
up
with
rocks
a
broken
ridge
passing
completely
across
it
between
these
confused
piles
of
stone
the
currents
were
fearfully
strong
and
formed
numerous
eddies
and
whirlpools
we
were
obliged
to
get
out
occasionally
and
walk
from
rock
to
rock
whilst
the
men
dragged
the
canoe
over
the
obstacles
beyond
tapaiunaquara
the
stream
became
again
broad
and
deep
and
the
river
scenery
was
beautiful
in
the
extreme
the
water
was
clear
and
of
a
colour
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
stretched
ranges
of
wooded
hills
and
in
the
middle
picturesque
islets
rested
on
the
smooth
water
whose
brilliant
green
woods
fringed
with
palms
formed
charming
bits
of
foreground
to
the
perspective
of
sombre
hills
fading
into
grey
in
the
distance
joaquim
pointed
out
to
us
grove
after
grove
of
brazil
nut
trees
bertholletia
excelsa
on
the
mainland
this
is
one
of
the
chief
collecting
grounds
for
this
nut
the
tree
is
one
of
the
loftiest
in
the
forest
towering
far
above
its
fellows
we
could
see
the
woody
fruits
large
and
round
as
dotted
over
the
branches
the
currents
were
very
strong
in
some
places
so
that
during
the
greater
part
of
the
way
the
men
preferred
to
travel
near
the
shore
and
propel
the
boat
by
means
of
long
poles
we
arrived
at
arroyos
about
four
in
the
afternoon
after
ten
hours
hard
pull
the
place
consists
simply
of
a
few
houses
built
on
a
high
bank
and
forms
a
station
where
canoemen
from
the
mining
countries
of
the
interior
of
brazil
stop
to
rest
themselves
before
or
after
surmounting
the
dreaded
falls
and
rapids
of
guaribas
situated
a
couple
of
miles
further
up
we
dined
ashore
and
in
the
evening
again
embarked
to
visit
the
falls
the
vigorous
and
successful
way
in
which
our
men
battled
with
the
terrific
currents
excited
our
astonishment
the
bed
of
the
river
here
about
a
mile
wide
is
strewn
with
blocks
of
various
sizes
which
lie
in
the
most
irregular
manner
and
between
them
rush
currents
of
more
or
less
rapidity
with
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
place
and
skillful
management
the
falls
can
be
approached
in
small
canoes
by
threading
the
less
dangerous
channels
the
main
fall
is
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
we
climbed
to
an
elevation
overlooking
it
and
had
a
good
view
of
the
cataract
a
body
of
water
rushes
with
terrific
force
down
a
steep
slope
and
boils
up
with
deafening
roar
around
the
boulders
which
obstruct
its
course
the
wildness
of
the
whole
scene
was
very
impressive
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
stretched
range
after
range
of
wooded
hills
and
scores
of
miles
of
beautiful
wilderness
inhabited
only
by
scanty
tribes
of
wild
indians
in
the
midst
of
such
a
solitude
the
roar
of
the
cataract
seemed
fitting
music
september
we
commenced
early
in
the
morning
our
downward
voyage
arroyos
is
situated
in
about
s
lat
and
lies
therefore
about
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
tocantins
fifteen
miles
above
guaribas
another
similar
cataract
called
tabocas
lies
across
the
river
we
were
told
that
there
were
in
all
fifteen
of
these
obstructions
to
navigate
between
arroyos
and
the
mouth
of
the
araguaya
the
worst
was
the
inferno
the
guaribas
standing
second
to
it
in
evil
reputation
many
canoes
and
lives
have
been
lost
here
most
of
the
accidents
arising
through
the
vessels
being
hurled
against
an
enormous
cubical
mass
of
rock
called
the
guaribinha
which
we
on
our
trip
to
the
falls
in
the
small
canoe
passed
round
with
the
greatest
ease
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
main
falls
this
however
was
the
dry
season
in
the
time
of
full
waters
a
tremendous
current
sets
against
it
we
descended
the
river
rapidly
and
found
it
excellent
fun
shooting
the
rapids
the
men
seemed
to
delight
in
choosing
the
swiftest
parts
of
the
current
they
sang
and
yelled
in
the
greatest
excitement
working
the
paddles
with
great
force
and
throwing
clouds
of
spray
above
us
as
we
bounded
downwards
we
stopped
to
rest
at
the
mouth
of
a
rivulet
named
caganxa
the
pilot
told
us
that
gold
had
been
found
in
the
bed
of
this
brook
so
we
had
the
curiosity
to
wade
several
hundred
yards
through
the
icy
cold
waters
in
search
of
it
leavens
seemed
very
much
interested
in
the
matter
he
picked
up
all
the
shining
stones
he
could
espy
in
the
pebbly
bottom
in
hopes
of
finding
diamonds
also
there
is
in
fact
no
reason
why
both
gold
and
diamonds
should
not
be
found
here
the
hills
being
a
continuation
of
those
of
the
mining
countries
of
interior
brazil
and
the
brooks
flowing
through
the
narrow
valleys
between
them
on
arriving
at
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
canoe
we
found
poor
jose
the
mulatto
much
worse
so
we
hastened
on
to
juquerapua
to
procure
aid
an
old
woman
took
charge
of
him
she
made
poultices
of
the
pulp
of
a
wild
fruit
administered
cooling
draughts
made
from
herbs
which
grew
near
the
house
and
in
fact
acted
the
part
of
nurse
admirably
we
stayed
at
this
place
all
night
and
part
of
the
following
day
and
i
had
a
stroll
along
a
delightful
pathway
which
led
over
hill
and
dale
two
or
three
miles
through
the
forest
i
was
surprised
at
the
number
and
variety
of
butterflies
they
were
all
of
small
size
and
started
forth
from
the
low
bushes
which
bordered
the
road
at
every
step
i
took
i
first
heard
here
the
notes
of
a
trogon
it
was
seated
alone
on
a
branch
at
no
great
elevation
a
beautiful
bird
with
back
and
breast
probably
trogon
melanurus
at
intervals
it
uttered
in
a
complaining
tone
a
sound
resembling
the
words
qua
qua
it
is
a
dull
inactive
bird
and
not
very
ready
to
take
flight
when
approached
in
this
respect
however
the
trogons
are
not
equal
to
the
jacamars
whose
stupidity
in
remaining
at
their
posts
seated
on
low
branches
in
the
gloomiest
shades
of
the
forest
is
somewhat
remarkable
in
a
country
where
all
other
birds
are
exceedingly
wary
one
species
of
jacamar
was
not
uncommon
here
galbula
viridis
i
sometimes
saw
two
or
three
together
seated
on
a
slender
branch
silent
and
motionless
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
movement
of
the
head
when
an
insect
flew
past
within
a
short
distance
one
of
the
birds
would
dart
off
seize
it
and
return
again
to
its
the
trogons
are
found
in
the
tropics
of
both
hemispheres
the
jacamars
which
are
clothed
in
plumage
of
the
most
beautiful
and
steel
colours
are
peculiar
to
tropical
america
at
night
i
slept
ashore
as
a
change
from
the
confinement
of
the
canoe
having
obtained
permission
from
senor
joaquim
to
sling
my
hammock
under
his
roof
the
house
like
all
others
in
these
parts
of
the
country
was
a
large
open
shed
having
one
end
enclosed
by
means
of
partitions
also
made
of
so
as
to
form
a
private
apartment
under
the
shed
were
placed
all
the
household
utensils
earthenware
jars
pots
and
kettles
hunting
and
fishing
implements
paddles
bows
and
arrows
harpoons
and
so
forth
one
or
two
common
wooden
chests
serve
to
contain
the
holiday
clothing
of
the
females
there
is
no
other
furniture
except
a
few
stools
and
the
hammock
which
answers
the
purposes
of
chair
and
sofa
when
a
visitor
enters
he
is
asked
to
sit
down
in
a
hammock
persons
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
each
other
recline
together
in
the
same
hammock
one
at
each
end
this
is
a
very
convenient
arrangement
for
friendly
conversation
there
are
neither
tables
nor
chairs
the
cloth
for
meals
is
spread
on
a
mat
and
the
guests
squat
round
in
any
position
they
choose
there
is
no
cordiality
of
manners
but
the
treatment
of
the
guests
shows
a
keen
sense
of
the
duties
of
hospitality
on
the
part
of
the
host
there
is
a
good
deal
of
formality
in
the
intercourse
of
these
mamelucos
which
i
believe
has
been
chiefly
derived
from
their
indian
forefathers
although
a
little
of
it
may
have
been
copied
from
the
portuguese
a
little
distance
from
the
house
were
the
open
sheds
under
which
the
farinha
for
the
use
of
the
establishment
was
manufactured
in
the
centre
of
each
shed
stood
the
shallow
pans
made
of
clay
and
built
over
ovens
where
the
meal
is
roasted
a
long
flexible
cylinder
made
of
the
peel
of
a
marantaceous
plant
plaited
into
the
proper
form
hung
suspended
from
a
beam
it
is
in
this
that
the
pulp
of
the
mandioca
is
pressed
and
from
it
the
juice
which
is
of
a
highly
poisonous
nature
although
the
pulp
is
wholesome
food
runs
into
pans
placed
beneath
to
receive
it
a
wooden
trough
such
as
is
used
in
all
these
places
for
receiving
the
pulp
before
the
poisonous
matter
is
extracted
stood
on
the
ground
and
from
the
posts
hung
the
long
baskets
or
aturas
in
which
the
women
carry
the
roots
from
the
roca
or
clearing
a
broad
ribbon
made
from
the
inner
bark
of
the
monguba
tree
is
attached
to
the
rims
of
the
baskets
and
is
passed
round
the
forehead
of
the
carriers
to
relieve
their
backs
in
supporting
the
heavy
load
around
the
shed
were
planted
a
number
of
banana
and
other
fruit
trees
among
them
were
the
failing
bushes
brilliant
as
at
christmas
time
with
their
fruit
and
lemon
trees
the
one
supplying
the
pungent
the
other
the
acid
for
sauce
to
the
perpetual
meal
of
fish
there
is
never
in
such
places
any
appearance
of
careful
cultivation
no
garden
or
orchard
the
useful
trees
are
surrounded
by
weeds
and
bushes
and
close
behind
rises
the
everlasting
forest
there
were
other
strangers
under
senor
joaquim
roof
besides
myself
mulattos
mamelucos
and
indian
so
we
formed
altogether
a
large
party
houses
occur
at
rare
intervals
in
this
wild
country
and
hospitality
is
freely
given
to
the
few
passing
travellers
after
a
frugal
supper
a
large
wood
fire
was
lighted
in
the
middle
of
the
shed
and
all
turned
in
to
their
hammocks
and
began
to
converse
a
few
of
the
party
soon
dropped
asleep
others
however
kept
awake
until
a
very
late
hour
telling
stories
some
related
adventures
which
had
happened
to
them
while
hunting
or
fishing
others
recounted
myths
about
the
curupira
and
other
demons
or
spirits
of
the
forest
they
were
all
very
appropriate
to
the
time
and
place
for
now
and
then
a
yell
or
a
shriek
resounded
through
the
gloomy
wilderness
around
the
shed
one
old
fellow
with
a
skin
the
colour
of
mahogany
seemed
to
be
a
capital
but
i
was
sorry
i
did
not
know
enough
of
the
language
to
follow
him
in
all
the
details
which
he
gave
amongst
other
things
he
related
an
adventure
he
had
once
had
with
a
jaguar
he
got
up
from
his
hammock
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
to
give
it
the
greater
effect
by
means
of
gestures
he
seized
a
bow
and
a
large
taquara
arrow
to
show
how
he
slew
the
beast
imitated
its
hoarse
growl
and
danced
about
the
fire
like
a
demon
in
descending
the
river
we
landed
frequently
and
wallace
and
i
lost
no
chance
of
adding
to
our
collections
so
that
before
the
end
of
our
journey
we
had
got
together
a
very
considerable
number
of
birds
insects
and
shells
chiefly
taken
however
in
the
low
country
leaving
baiao
we
took
our
last
farewell
of
the
limpid
waters
and
varied
scenery
of
the
upper
river
and
found
ourselves
again
in
the
humid
flat
region
of
the
amazons
valley
we
sailed
down
this
lower
part
of
the
river
by
a
different
channel
from
the
one
we
travelled
along
in
ascending
and
frequently
went
ashore
on
the
low
islands
in
as
already
stated
these
are
covered
with
water
in
the
wet
season
but
at
this
time
there
having
been
three
months
of
fine
weather
they
were
dry
throughout
and
by
the
subsidence
of
the
waters
placed
four
or
five
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
they
are
covered
with
a
most
luxuriant
forest
comprising
a
large
number
of
trees
we
found
several
people
encamped
here
who
were
engaged
in
collecting
and
preparing
the
rubber
and
thus
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
process
the
tree
which
yields
this
valuable
sap
is
the
siphonia
elastica
a
member
of
the
euphorbiaceous
order
it
belongs
therefore
to
a
group
of
plants
quite
different
from
that
which
furnishes
the
caoutchouc
of
the
east
indies
and
africa
this
latter
is
the
product
of
different
species
of
ficus
and
is
considered
i
believe
in
commerce
an
inferior
article
to
the
of
para
the
siphonia
elastica
grows
only
on
the
lowlands
in
the
amazons
region
hitherto
the
rubber
has
been
collected
chiefly
in
the
islands
and
swampy
parts
of
the
mainland
within
a
distance
of
fifty
to
a
hundred
miles
to
the
west
of
para
but
there
are
plenty
of
untapped
trees
still
growing
in
the
wilds
of
the
tapajos
madeira
jurua
and
jauari
as
far
as
miles
from
the
atlantic
coast
the
tree
is
not
remarkable
in
appearance
in
bark
and
foliage
it
is
not
unlike
the
european
ash
but
the
trunk
like
that
of
all
forest
trees
shoots
up
to
an
immense
height
before
throwing
off
branches
the
trees
seem
to
be
no
man
property
hereabout
the
people
we
met
with
told
us
they
came
every
year
to
collect
rubber
on
these
islands
as
soon
as
the
waters
had
subsided
namely
in
august
and
remained
until
january
or
february
the
process
is
very
simple
every
morning
each
person
man
or
woman
to
whom
is
allotted
a
certain
number
of
trees
goes
the
round
of
the
whole
and
collects
in
a
large
vessel
the
milky
sap
which
trickles
from
gashes
made
in
the
bark
on
the
preceding
evening
and
which
is
received
in
little
clay
cups
or
in
ampullaria
shells
stuck
beneath
the
wounds
the
sap
which
at
first
is
of
the
consistence
of
cream
soon
thickens
the
collectors
are
provided
with
a
great
number
of
wooden
moulds
of
the
shape
in
which
the
rubber
is
wanted
and
when
they
return
to
the
camp
they
dip
them
into
the
liquid
laying
on
in
the
course
of
several
days
one
coat
after
another
when
this
is
done
the
substance
is
white
and
hard
the
proper
colour
and
consistency
are
given
by
passing
it
repeatedly
through
a
thick
black
smoke
obtained
by
burning
the
nuts
of
certain
palm
trees
after
which
process
the
article
is
ready
for
sale
is
known
throughout
the
province
only
by
the
name
of
seringa
the
portuguese
word
for
syringe
it
owes
this
appellation
to
the
circumstance
that
it
was
only
in
this
form
that
the
first
portuguese
settlers
noticed
it
to
be
employed
by
the
aborigines
it
is
said
that
the
indians
were
first
taught
to
make
syringes
of
rubber
by
seeing
natural
tubes
formed
by
it
when
the
sap
gathered
round
projecting
twigs
brazilians
of
all
classes
still
use
it
extensively
in
the
form
of
syringes
for
injections
form
a
great
feature
in
the
popular
system
of
cures
the
rubber
for
this
purpose
is
made
into
a
shaped
bottle
and
a
quill
fixed
in
the
long
neck
september
opposite
cameta
the
islands
are
all
planted
with
cacao
the
tree
which
yields
the
chocolate
nut
the
forest
is
not
cleared
for
the
purpose
but
the
cacao
plants
are
stuck
in
here
and
there
almost
at
random
amongst
the
trees
there
are
many
houses
on
the
banks
of
the
river
all
elevated
above
the
swampy
soil
on
wooden
piles
and
furnished
with
broad
ladders
by
which
to
mount
to
the
ground
floor
as
we
passed
by
in
our
canoe
we
could
see
the
people
at
their
occupations
in
the
open
verandas
and
in
one
place
saw
a
ball
going
on
in
broad
daylight
there
were
fiddles
and
guitars
hard
at
work
and
a
number
of
lads
in
white
shirts
and
trousers
dancing
with
brown
damsels
clad
in
showy
print
dresses
the
cacao
tree
produces
a
curious
impression
on
account
of
the
flowers
and
fruit
growing
directly
out
of
the
trunk
and
branches
there
is
a
whole
group
of
wild
fruit
trees
which
have
the
same
habit
in
this
country
in
the
wildernesses
where
the
cacao
is
planted
the
collecting
of
the
fruit
is
dangerous
due
to
the
number
of
poisonous
snakes
which
inhabit
the
places
one
day
when
we
were
running
our
montaria
to
a
place
we
saw
a
large
serpent
on
the
trees
overhead
as
we
were
about
to
brush
past
the
boat
was
stopped
just
in
the
nick
of
time
and
leavens
brought
the
reptile
down
with
a
charge
of
shot
september
at
length
we
got
clear
of
the
islands
and
saw
once
more
before
us
the
expanse
of
waters
which
forms
the
mouth
of
the
tocantins
the
river
had
now
sunk
to
its
lowest
point
and
numbers
of
dolphins
were
rolling
about
in
shoaly
places
there
are
here
two
species
one
of
which
was
new
to
science
when
i
sent
specimens
to
england
it
is
called
the
tucuxi
steno
tucuxi
of
gray
when
it
comes
to
the
surface
to
breathe
it
rises
horizontally
showing
first
its
back
fin
then
draws
an
inspiration
and
dives
gently
down
head
foremost
this
mode
of
proceeding
distinguishes
the
tucuxi
at
once
from
the
other
species
which
is
called
bouto
or
porpoise
by
the
natives
inia
geoffroyi
of
desmarest
when
this
rises
the
top
of
the
head
is
the
part
first
seen
it
then
blows
and
immediately
afterwards
dips
head
downwards
its
back
curving
over
exposing
successively
the
whole
dorsal
ridge
with
its
fin
it
seems
thus
to
pitch
heels
over
head
but
does
not
show
the
tail
fin
besides
this
peculiar
motion
it
is
distinguished
from
the
tucuxi
by
its
habit
of
generally
going
in
pairs
both
species
are
exceedingly
numerous
throughout
the
amazons
and
its
larger
tributaries
but
they
are
nowhere
more
plentiful
than
in
the
shoaly
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
tocantins
especially
in
the
dry
season
in
the
upper
amazons
a
third
pale
species
is
also
abundant
the
delphinus
pallidus
of
gervais
with
the
exception
of
a
species
found
in
the
ganges
all
other
varieties
of
dolphin
inhabit
the
sea
exclusively
in
the
broader
parts
of
the
amazons
from
its
mouth
to
a
distance
of
fifteen
hundred
miles
in
the
interior
one
or
other
of
the
three
kinds
here
mentioned
are
always
heard
rolling
blowing
and
snorting
especially
at
night
and
these
noises
contribute
much
to
the
impression
of
vastness
and
desolation
which
haunts
the
traveller
besides
dolphins
in
the
water
frigate
birds
in
the
air
are
characteristic
of
this
lower
part
of
the
tocantins
flocks
of
them
were
seen
the
last
two
or
three
days
of
our
journey
hovering
above
at
an
immense
height
towards
night
we
were
obliged
to
cast
anchor
over
a
shoal
in
the
middle
of
the
river
to
await
the
ebb
tide
the
wind
blew
very
strongly
and
this
together
with
the
incoming
flow
caused
such
a
heavy
sea
that
it
was
impossible
to
sleep
the
vessel
rolled
and
pitched
until
every
bone
in
our
bodies
ached
with
the
bumps
we
received
and
we
were
all
more
or
less
seasick
on
the
following
day
we
entered
the
anapu
and
on
the
september
after
threading
again
the
labyrinth
of
channels
communicating
between
the
tocantins
and
the
moju
arrived
at
para
i
will
now
give
a
short
account
of
cameta
the
principal
town
on
the
banks
of
the
tocantins
which
i
visited
for
the
second
time
in
wallace
in
the
same
month
departed
from
para
to
explore
the
rivers
guama
and
capim
i
embarked
as
passenger
in
a
cameta
trading
vessel
the
john
a
small
schooner
of
thirty
tons
burthen
i
had
learnt
by
this
time
that
the
only
way
to
attain
the
objects
for
which
i
had
come
to
this
country
was
to
accustom
myself
to
the
ways
of
life
of
the
humbler
classes
of
the
inhabitants
a
traveller
on
the
amazons
gains
little
by
being
furnished
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
persons
of
note
for
in
the
great
interior
wildernesses
of
forest
and
river
the
canoemen
have
pretty
much
their
own
way
the
authorities
can
not
force
them
to
grant
passages
or
to
hire
themselves
to
travellers
and
therefore
a
stranger
is
obliged
to
ingratiate
himself
with
them
in
order
to
get
conveyed
from
place
to
place
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
journey
to
cameta
the
weather
was
again
beautiful
in
the
extreme
we
started
from
para
at
sunrise
on
the
of
june
and
on
the
emerged
from
the
narrow
channels
of
the
anapu
into
the
broad
tocantins
the
vessel
was
so
full
of
cargo
that
there
was
no
room
to
sleep
in
the
cabin
so
we
passed
the
nights
on
deck
the
captain
or
supercargo
called
in
portuguese
cabo
was
a
mameluco
named
manoel
a
quiet
person
who
treated
me
with
the
most
unaffected
civility
during
the
three
days
journey
the
pilot
was
also
a
mameluco
named
john
mendez
a
handsome
young
fellow
full
of
life
and
spirit
he
had
on
board
a
wire
guitar
or
viola
as
it
is
here
called
and
in
the
bright
moonlight
nights
as
we
lay
at
anchor
hour
after
hour
waiting
for
the
tide
he
enlivened
us
all
with
songs
and
music
he
was
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
cabo
both
sleeping
in
the
same
hammock
slung
between
the
masts
i
passed
the
nights
wrapped
in
an
old
sail
outside
the
roof
of
the
cabin
the
crew
five
in
number
were
indians
and
all
of
whom
treated
their
two
superiors
with
the
most
amusing
familiarity
yet
i
never
sailed
in
a
better
managed
vessel
than
the
john
in
crossing
to
cameta
we
had
to
await
the
in
a
channel
called
which
lies
between
two
islands
in
river
and
john
mendez
being
in
good
tune
gave
us
an
extempore
song
consisting
of
a
great
number
of
verses
the
crew
lay
about
the
deck
listening
and
all
joined
in
the
chorus
some
stanzas
related
to
me
telling
how
i
had
come
all
the
way
from
inglaterra
to
skin
monkeys
and
birds
and
catch
insects
the
employment
of
course
giving
ample
scope
for
fun
he
passed
from
this
to
the
subject
of
political
parties
in
cameta
and
then
as
all
the
hearers
were
cametaenses
and
understood
the
hits
there
were
roars
of
laughter
some
of
them
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
deck
so
much
were
they
tickled
party
spirit
runs
high
at
cameta
not
merely
in
connection
with
local
politics
but
in
relation
to
affairs
of
general
concern
such
as
the
election
of
members
to
the
imperial
parliament
and
so
forth
this
political
strife
is
partly
attributable
to
the
circumstance
that
a
native
of
cameta
angelo
custodio
correia
had
been
in
almost
every
election
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
representation
of
the
province
i
fancied
these
shrewd
but
unsophisticated
saw
through
the
absurdities
attending
these
local
contests
and
hence
their
inclination
to
satirise
them
they
were
however
evidently
partisans
of
angelo
the
brother
of
angelo
joao
augusto
correia
a
distinguished
merchant
was
an
active
canvasser
the
party
of
the
correias
was
the
liberal
or
as
it
is
called
throughout
brazil
the
santa
luzia
faction
the
opposite
side
at
the
head
of
which
was
one
pedro
moraes
was
the
conservative
or
saquarema
party
i
preserved
one
of
the
stanzas
of
the
song
which
however
does
not
contain
much
point
it
ran
thus
ora
pana
tana
pana
pana
tana
joao
augusto
he
bonito
e
homem
pimpao
mas
pedro
he
feio
e
hum
grande
ladrao
chorus
ora
pana
etc
john
augustus
is
handsome
and
as
a
man
ought
to
be
but
peter
is
ugly
and
a
great
thief
chorus
ora
pana
etc
the
of
the
amazons
have
many
songs
and
choruses
with
which
they
are
in
the
habit
of
relieving
the
monotony
of
their
slow
voyages
and
which
are
known
all
over
the
interior
the
choruses
consist
of
a
simple
strain
repeated
almost
to
weariness
and
sung
generally
in
unison
but
sometimes
with
an
attempt
at
harmony
there
is
a
wildness
and
sadness
about
the
tunes
which
harmonise
well
with
and
in
fact
are
born
of
the
circumstances
of
the
life
the
echoing
channels
the
endless
gloomy
forests
the
solemn
nights
and
the
desolate
scenes
of
broad
and
stormy
waters
and
falling
banks
whether
they
were
invented
by
the
indians
or
introduced
by
the
portuguese
it
is
hard
to
decide
as
many
of
the
customs
of
the
lower
classes
of
portuguese
are
so
similar
to
those
of
the
indians
that
they
have
become
blended
with
them
one
of
the
commonest
songs
is
very
wild
and
pretty
it
has
for
refrain
the
words
mai
mai
mother
mother
with
a
long
drawl
on
the
second
word
the
stanzas
are
quite
variable
the
best
wit
on
board
starts
the
verse
improvising
as
he
goes
on
and
the
others
join
in
the
chorus
they
all
relate
to
the
lonely
river
life
and
the
events
of
the
voyage
the
shoals
the
wind
how
far
they
shall
go
before
they
stop
to
sleep
and
so
forth
the
sonorous
native
names
of
places
goajara
tucumanduba
add
greatly
to
the
charm
of
the
wild
music
sometimes
they
bring
in
the
stars
thus
a
lua
esta
sahindo
mai
mai
a
lua

i
fell
asleep
about
ten
but
at
four
in
the
morning
john
mendez
woke
me
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
the
little
schooner
tearing
through
the
waves
before
a
spanking
breeze
the
night
was
transparently
clear
and
almost
cold
the
moon
appeared
sharply
defined
against
the
dark
blue
sky
and
a
ridge
of
foam
marked
where
the
prow
of
the
vessel
was
cleaving
its
way
through
the
water
the
men
had
made
a
fire
in
the
galley
to
make
tea
of
an
acid
herb
called
erva
cidreira
a
quantity
of
which
they
had
gathered
at
the
last
and
the
flames
sparkled
cheerily
upwards
it
is
at
such
times
as
these
that
amazon
travelling
is
enjoyable
and
one
no
longer
wonders
at
the
love
which
many
both
natives
and
strangers
have
for
this
wandering
life
the
little
schooner
sped
rapidly
on
with
booms
bent
and
sails
stretched
to
the
utmost
just
as
day
dawned
we
ran
with
scarcely
slackened
speed
into
the
port
of
cameta
and
cast
anchor
i
stayed
at
cameta
until
the
of
july
and
made
a
considerable
collection
of
the
natural
productions
of
the
neighbourhood
the
town
in
was
estimated
to
contain
about
inhabitants
but
the
municipal
district
of
which
cameta
is
the
capital
numbered
this
however
comprised
the
whole
of
the
lower
part
of
the
tocantins
which
is
the
most
thickly
populated
part
of
the
province
of
para
the
productions
of
the
district
are
cacao
and
brazil
nuts
the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
social
aspect
of
the
place
is
the
hybrid
nature
of
the
whole
population
the
amalgamation
of
the
white
and
indian
races
being
here
complete
the
aborigines
were
originally
very
numerous
on
the
western
bank
of
the
tocantins
the
principal
tribe
having
been
the
camutas
from
which
the
city
takes
its
name
they
were
a
superior
nation
settled
and
attached
to
agriculture
and
received
with
open
arms
the
white
immigrants
who
were
attracted
to
the
district
by
its
fertility
natural
beauty
and
the
healthfulness
of
the
climate
the
portuguese
settlers
were
nearly
all
males
the
indian
women
were
and
made
excellent
wives
so
the
natural
result
has
been
in
the
course
of
two
centuries
a
complete
blending
of
the
two
races
there
is
now
however
a
considerable
infusion
of
negro
blood
in
the
mixture
several
hundred
african
slaves
having
been
introduced
during
the
last
seventy
years
the
few
whites
are
chiefly
portuguese
but
there
are
also
two
or
three
brazilian
families
of
pure
european
descent
the
town
consists
of
three
long
streets
running
parallel
to
the
river
with
a
few
shorter
ones
crossing
them
at
right
angles
the
houses
are
very
plain
being
built
as
usual
in
this
country
simply
of
a
strong
framework
filled
up
with
mud
and
coated
with
white
plaster
a
few
of
them
are
of
two
or
three
stories
there
are
three
churches
and
also
a
small
theatre
where
a
company
of
native
actors
at
the
time
of
my
visit
were
representing
light
portuguese
plays
with
considerable
taste
and
ability
the
people
have
a
reputation
all
over
the
province
for
energy
and
perseverance
and
it
is
often
said
that
they
are
as
keen
in
trade
as
the
portuguese
the
lower
classes
are
as
indolent
and
sensual
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
province
a
moral
condition
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
a
country
where
perpetual
summer
reigns
and
where
the
necessities
of
life
are
so
easily
obtained
but
they
are
communicative
and
hospitable
i
found
here
a
native
poet
who
had
written
some
pretty
verses
showing
an
appreciation
of
the
natural
beauties
of
the
country
and
was
told
that
the
archbishop
of
bahia
the
primate
of
brazil
was
a
native
of
cameta
it
is
interesting
to
find
the
mamelucos
displaying
talent
and
enterprise
for
it
shows
that
degeneracy
does
not
necessarily
result
from
the
mixture
of
white
and
indian
blood
the
cametaenses
boast
as
they
have
a
right
to
do
of
theirs
being
the
only
large
town
which
resisted
successfully
the
anarchists
in
the
great
rebellion
of
while
the
whites
of
para
were
submitting
to
the
rule
of
revolutionists
the
mamelucos
of
cameta
placed
themselves
under
the
leadership
of
a
courageous
priest
named
prudencio
they
armed
themselves
fortified
the
place
and
repulsed
the
large
forces
which
the
insurgents
of
para
sent
to
attack
the
place
the
town
not
only
became
the
refuge
for
all
loyal
subjects
but
was
a
centre
whence
large
parties
of
volunteers
sallied
forth
repeatedly
to
attack
the
anarchists
in
their
various
strongholds
the
forest
behind
cameta
is
traversed
by
several
broad
roads
which
lead
over
undulating
ground
many
miles
into
the
interior
they
pass
generally
under
shade
and
part
of
the
way
through
groves
of
coffee
and
orange
trees
fragrant
plantations
of
cacao
and
tracts
of
woods
the
narrow
valleys
with
which
the
land
is
intersected
alone
have
remained
clothed
with
primaeval
forest
at
least
near
the
town
the
houses
along
these
beautiful
roads
belong
chiefly
to
mameluco
mulatto
and
indian
families
each
of
which
has
its
own
small
plantation
there
are
only
a
few
planters
with
larger
establishments
and
these
have
seldom
more
than
a
dozen
slaves
besides
the
main
roads
there
are
endless
bypaths
which
thread
the
forest
and
communicate
with
isolated
houses
along
these
the
traveller
may
wander
day
after
day
without
leaving
the
shade
and
everywhere
meet
with
cheerful
simple
and
hospitable
people
soon
after
landing
i
was
introduced
to
the
most
distinguished
citizen
of
the
place
angelo
custodio
correia
whom
i
have
already
mentioned
this
excellent
man
was
a
favourable
specimen
of
the
highest
class
of
native
brazilians
he
had
been
educated
in
europe
was
now
a
member
of
the
brazilian
parliament
and
had
been
twice
president
of
his
native
manners
were
less
formal
and
his
goodness
more
thoroughly
genuine
perhaps
than
is
the
rule
generally
with
brazilians
he
was
admired
and
loved
as
i
had
ample
opportunity
of
observing
throughout
all
amazonia
he
sacrificed
his
life
in
for
the
good
of
his
townsmen
when
cameta
was
devastated
by
the
cholera
having
stayed
behind
with
a
few
heroic
spirits
to
succour
invalids
and
direct
the
burying
of
the
dead
when
nearly
all
the
chief
citizens
had
fled
from
the
place
after
he
had
done
what
he
could
he
embarked
for
para
but
was
himself
then
attacked
with
cholera
and
died
on
board
the
steamer
before
he
reached
the
capital
angelo
received
me
with
the
usual
kindness
which
he
showed
to
all
strangers
he
procured
me
unsolicited
a
charming
country
house
free
of
rent
hired
a
mulatto
servant
for
me
and
thus
relieved
me
of
the
many
annoyances
and
delays
attendant
on
a
first
arrival
in
a
country
town
where
even
the
name
of
an
inn
is
unknown
the
rocinha
thus
given
up
for
my
residence
belonged
to
a
friend
of
his
senor
jose
raimundo
furtado
a
stout
complexioned
gentleman
such
a
one
as
might
be
met
with
any
day
in
a
country
town
in
england
to
him
also
i
was
indebted
for
many
acts
of
kindness
the
rocinha
was
situated
near
a
broad
grassy
road
bordered
by
lofty
woods
which
leads
from
cameta
to
the
aldeia
a
village
two
miles
distant
my
first
walks
were
along
this
road
from
it
branches
another
similar
but
still
more
picturesque
road
which
runs
to
curima
and
pacaja
two
small
settlements
several
miles
distant
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
the
curima
road
is
beautiful
in
the
extreme
about
half
a
mile
from
the
house
where
i
lived
it
crosses
a
brook
flowing
through
a
deep
dell
by
means
of
a
long
rustic
wooden
bridge
the
virgin
forest
is
here
left
untouched
numerous
groups
of
slender
palms
mingled
with
lofty
trees
overrun
with
creepers
and
parasites
fill
the
shady
glen
and
arch
over
the
bridge
forming
one
of
the
most
picturesque
scenes
imaginable
a
little
beyond
the
bridge
there
was
an
extensive
grove
of
orange
and
other
trees
which
yielded
me
a
rich
harvest
the
aldeia
road
runs
parallel
to
the
river
the
land
from
the
border
of
the
road
to
the
indented
shore
of
the
tocantins
forming
a
long
slope
which
was
also
richly
wooded
this
slope
was
threaded
by
numerous
shady
paths
and
abounded
in
beautiful
insects
and
birds
at
the
opposite
or
southern
end
of
the
town
there
was
a
broad
road
called
the
estrada
da
vacaria
this
ran
along
the
banks
of
the
tocantins
at
some
distance
from
the
river
and
continued
over
hill
and
dale
through
bamboo
thickets
and
palm
swamps
for
about
fifteen
miles
at
cameta
i
chanced
to
verify
a
fact
relating
to
the
habits
of
a
large
hairy
spider
of
the
genus
mygale
in
a
manner
worth
recording
the
species
was
avicularia
or
one
very
closely
allied
to
it
the
individual
was
nearly
two
inches
in
length
of
body
but
the
legs
expanded
seven
inches
and
the
entire
body
and
legs
were
covered
with
coarse
grey
and
reddish
hairs
i
was
attracted
by
a
movement
of
the
monster
on
a
it
was
close
beneath
a
deep
crevice
in
the
tree
across
which
was
stretched
a
dense
white
web
the
lower
part
of
the
web
was
broken
and
two
small
birds
finches
were
entangled
in
the
pieces
they
were
about
the
size
of
the
english
siskin
and
i
judged
the
two
to
be
male
and
female
one
of
them
was
quite
dead
the
other
lay
under
the
body
of
the
spider
not
quite
dead
and
was
smeared
with
the
filthy
liquor
or
saliva
exuded
by
the
monster
i
drove
away
the
spider
and
took
the
birds
but
the
second
one
soon
died
the
fact
of
species
of
mygale
sallying
forth
at
night
mounting
trees
and
sucking
the
eggs
and
young
of
hummingbirds
has
been
recorded
long
ago
by
madame
merian
and
palisot
de
beauvois
but
in
the
absence
of
any
confirmation
it
has
come
to
be
discredited
from
the
way
the
fact
has
been
related
it
would
appear
that
it
had
been
merely
derived
from
the
report
of
natives
and
had
not
been
witnessed
by
the
narrators
count
langsdorff
in
his
expedition
into
the
interior
of
brazil
states
that
he
totally
disbelieved
the
story
i
found
the
circumstance
to
be
quite
a
novelty
to
the
residents
hereabout
the
mygales
are
quite
common
insects
some
species
make
their
cells
under
stones
others
form
artistical
tunnels
in
the
earth
and
some
build
their
dens
in
the
thatch
of
houses
the
natives
call
them
aranhas
carangueijeiras
or
the
hairs
with
which
they
are
clothed
come
off
when
touched
and
cause
a
peculiar
and
almost
maddening
irritation
the
first
specimen
that
i
killed
and
prepared
was
handled
incautiously
and
i
suffered
terribly
for
three
days
afterwards
i
think
this
is
not
owing
to
any
poisonous
quality
residing
in
the
hairs
but
to
their
being
short
and
hard
and
thus
getting
into
the
fine
creases
of
the
skin
some
mygales
are
of
immense
size
one
day
i
saw
the
children
belonging
to
an
indian
family
who
collected
for
me
with
one
of
these
monsters
secured
by
a
cord
round
its
waist
by
which
they
were
leading
it
about
the
house
as
they
would
a
dog
the
only
monkeys
i
observed
at
cameta
were
the
couxio
pithecia
satanas
a
large
species
clothed
with
long
the
tiny
midas
argentatus
the
couxio
has
a
thick
bushy
tail
and
the
hair
of
the
head
which
looks
as
if
it
had
been
carefully
combed
sits
on
it
like
a
wig
it
inhabits
only
the
most
retired
parts
of
the
forest
on
the
terra
firma
and
i
observed
nothing
of
its
habits
the
little
midas
argentatus
is
one
of
the
rarest
of
the
american
monkeys
indeed
i
have
not
heard
of
its
being
found
anywhere
except
near
cameta
where
i
once
saw
three
individuals
looking
like
so
many
white
kittens
running
along
a
branch
in
a
cacao
grove
in
their
motions
they
resembled
precisely
the
midas
ursulus
already
described
i
saw
afterwards
a
pet
animal
of
this
species
and
heard
that
there
were
many
so
kept
and
that
they
were
esteemed
as
great
treasures
the
one
mentioned
was
although
it
measured
only
seven
inches
in
length
of
body
it
was
covered
with
long
white
silky
hairs
the
tail
being
blackish
and
the
face
nearly
naked
and
it
was
a
most
timid
and
sensitive
little
thing
the
woman
who
owned
it
carried
it
constantly
in
her
bosom
and
no
money
would
induce
her
to
part
with
her
pet
she
called
it
mico
it
fed
from
her
mouth
and
allowed
her
to
fondle
it
freely
but
the
nervous
little
creature
would
not
permit
strangers
to
touch
it
if
any
one
attempted
to
do
so
it
shrank
back
the
whole
body
trembling
with
fear
and
its
teeth
chattered
while
it
uttered
its
tremulous
frightened
tones
the
expression
of
its
features
was
like
that
of
its
more
robust
brother
midas
ursulus
the
eyes
which
were
black
were
full
of
curiosity
and
mistrust
and
were
always
kept
fixed
upon
the
person
who
attempted
to
advance
towards
it
in
the
orange
groves
and
other
parts
hummingbirds
were
plentiful
but
i
did
not
notice
more
than
three
species
i
saw
one
day
a
little
pigmy
belonging
to
the
genus
phaethornis
in
the
act
of
washing
itself
in
a
brook
perched
on
a
thin
branch
one
end
of
which
was
under
water
it
dipped
itself
then
fluttered
its
wings
and
pruned
its
feathers
and
seemed
thoroughly
to
enjoy
itself
alone
in
the
shady
nook
which
it
had
chosen
a
place
overshadowed
by
broad
leaves
of
ferns
and
heliconiae
i
thought
as
i
watched
it
that
there
was
no
need
for
poets
to
invent
elves
and
gnomes
while
nature
furnishes
us
with
such
marvellous
little
sprites
ready
at
hand
my
return
journey
to
para
afforded
many
incidents
characteristic
of
amazonian
travelling
i
left
cameta
on
the
of
july
my
luggage
was
embarked
in
the
morning
in
the
santa
rosa
a
vessel
of
the
kind
called
cuberta
or
covered
canoe
the
cuberta
is
very
much
used
on
these
rivers
it
is
not
decked
but
the
sides
forward
are
raised
and
arched
over
so
as
to
admit
of
cargo
being
piled
high
above
the
at
the
stern
is
a
neat
square
cabin
also
raised
and
between
the
cabin
and
covered
forepart
is
a
narrow
piece
decked
over
on
which
are
placed
the
cooking
arrangements
this
is
called
the
tombadilha
or
quarterdeck
and
when
the
canoe
is
heavily
laden
it
goes
underwater
as
the
vessel
heels
over
to
the
wind
there
are
two
masts
rigged
with
fore
and
aft
sails
the
foremast
has
often
besides
a
main
and
top
sail
the
forepart
is
planked
over
at
the
top
and
on
this
raised
deck
the
crew
work
the
vessel
pulling
it
along
when
there
is
no
wind
by
means
of
the
long
oars
already
described
as
i
have
just
said
my
luggage
was
embarked
in
the
morning
i
was
informed
that
we
should
start
with
the
in
the
afternoon
so
i
thought
i
should
have
time
to
pay
my
respects
to
angelo
and
other
friends
whose
extreme
courtesy
and
goodness
had
made
my
residence
at
cameta
so
agreeable
after
dinner
the
guests
according
to
custom
at
the
house
of
the
correias
walked
into
the
cool
verandah
which
overlooks
the
river
and
there
we
saw
the
santa
rosa
a
mere
speck
in
the
offing
miles
away
tacking
down
river
with
a
fine
breeze
i
was
now
in
a
fix
for
it
would
be
useless
attempting
to
overtake
the
cuberta
and
besides
the
sea
ran
too
high
for
any
montaria
i
was
then
told
that
i
ought
to
have
been
aboard
hours
before
the
time
fixed
for
starting
because
when
a
breeze
springs
up
vessels
start
before
the
tide
turns
the
last
hour
of
the
flood
not
being
very
strong
all
my
precious
collections
my
clothes
and
other
necessaries
were
on
board
and
it
was
indispensable
that
i
should
be
at
para
when
the
things
were
disembarked
i
tried
to
hire
a
montaria
and
men
but
was
told
that
it
would
be
madness
to
cross
the
river
in
a
small
boat
with
this
breeze
on
going
to
senor
laroque
another
of
my
cameta
friends
i
was
relieved
of
my
embarrassment
for
i
found
there
an
english
gentleman
patchett
of
pernambuco
who
was
visiting
para
and
its
neighbourhood
on
his
way
to
england
and
who
as
he
was
going
back
to
para
in
a
small
boat
with
four
paddles
which
would
start
at
midnight
kindly
offered
me
a
passage
the
evening
from
seven
to
ten
was
very
stormy
about
seven
the
night
became
intensely
dark
and
a
terrific
squall
of
wind
burst
forth
which
made
the
loose
tiles
fly
over
the
housetops
to
this
succeeded
lightning
and
stupendous
claps
of
thunder
both
nearly
simultaneous
we
had
had
several
of
these
short
and
sharp
storms
during
the
past
month
at
midnight
when
we
embarked
all
was
as
calm
as
though
a
ruffle
had
never
disturbed
air
forest
or
river
the
boat
sped
along
like
an
arrow
to
the
rhythmic
paddling
of
the
four
stout
youths
we
had
with
us
who
enlivened
the
passage
with
their
wild
songs
patchett
and
i
tried
to
get
a
little
sleep
but
the
cabin
was
so
small
and
encumbered
with
boxes
placed
at
all
sorts
of
angles
that
we
found
sleep
impossible
i
was
just
dozing
when
the
day
dawned
and
on
awakening
the
first
object
i
saw
was
the
santa
rosa
at
anchor
under
a
green
island
in
i
preferred
to
make
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
in
company
of
my
collections
so
bade
patchett
the
owner
of
the
santa
rosa
senor
jacinto
machado
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
received
me
aboard
and
apologised
for
having
started
without
me
he
was
a
white
man
a
planter
and
was
now
taking
his
year
production
of
cacao
about
twenty
tons
to
para
the
canoe
was
very
heavily
laden
and
i
was
rather
alarmed
to
see
that
it
was
leaking
at
all
points
the
crew
were
all
in
the
water
diving
about
to
feel
for
the
holes
which
they
stopped
with
pieces
of
ray
and
clay
and
an
old
negro
was
baling
the
water
out
of
the
hold
this
was
a
pleasant
prospect
for
a
voyage
senor
machado
treated
it
as
the
most
ordinary
incident
possible
it
was
always
likely
to
leak
for
it
was
an
old
vessel
that
had
been
left
as
worthless
high
and
dry
on
the
beach
and
he
had
bought
it
very
cheap
when
the
leaks
were
stopped
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
and
at
night
reached
the
mouth
of
the
anapu
i
wrapped
myself
in
an
old
sail
and
fell
asleep
on
the
raised
deck
the
next
day
we
threaded
the
and
on
the
descended
the
moju
senor
machado
and
i
by
this
time
had
become
very
good
friends
at
every
interesting
spot
on
the
banks
of
the
moju
he
manned
the
small
boat
and
took
me
ashore
there
are
many
large
houses
on
this
river
belonging
to
what
were
formerly
large
and
flourishing
plantations
but
which
since
the
revolution
of
had
been
suffered
to
go
to
decay
two
of
the
largest
buildings
were
constructed
by
the
jesuits
in
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
we
were
told
that
there
were
formerly
eleven
large
sugar
mills
on
the
banks
of
the
moju
while
now
there
are
only
three
at
burujuba
there
is
a
large
monastery
in
a
state
of
ruin
part
of
the
edifice
however
was
still
inhabited
by
a
brazilian
family
the
walls
are
four
feet
in
thickness
the
long
dark
corridors
and
gloomy
cloisters
struck
me
as
very
inappropriate
in
the
midst
of
this
young
and
radiant
nature
they
would
be
better
if
placed
on
some
barren
moor
in
northern
europe
than
here
in
the
midst
of
perpetual
summer
the
next
turn
in
the
river
below
burujuba
brought
the
city
of
para
into
view
the
wind
was
now
against
us
and
we
were
obliged
to
tack
about
towards
evening
it
began
to
blow
stiffly
the
vessel
heeled
over
very
much
and
senor
machado
for
the
first
time
trembled
for
the
safety
of
his
cargo
the
leaks
burst
out
afresh
when
we
were
yet
two
miles
from
the
shore
he
ordered
another
sail
to
be
hoisted
in
order
to
run
more
quickly
into
port
but
soon
afterwards
an
extra
puff
of
wind
came
and
the
old
boat
lurched
alarmingly
the
rigging
gave
way
and
down
fell
boom
and
sail
with
a
crash
encumbering
us
with
the
wreck
we
were
then
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
oars
and
as
soon
as
we
were
near
the
land
fearing
that
the
crazy
vessel
would
sink
before
reaching
port
i
begged
senor
machado
to
send
me
ashore
in
the
boat
with
the
more
precious

that
part
of
the

river
which
lies
in
front
of
the
city
as
i
have
already
explained
forms
a
narrow
channel
being
separated
from
the
main
waters
of
the
estuary
by
a
cluster
of
islands
this
channel
is
about
two
miles
broad
and
constitutes
part
of
the
minor
estuary
of
goajara
into
which
the
three
rivers
guama
moju

discharge
their

the
main

of

lies
ten
miles
away
from
the
city
directly
across
the
river
at
that
point
after
getting
clear
of
the
islands
a
great
expanse
of
water
is
beheld
ten
to
twelve
miles
in
width
on
the
opposite
shore
the
island
of
marajo
being
visible
only
in
clear
weather
as
a
line
of
dotting
the
horizon
a
little
further
upwards
that
is
to
the
southwest
the
mainland
on
the
right
or
eastern
shore
appears
this
is
called
carnapijo
it
is
rocky
covered
with
the
neverending
forest
and
the
coast
which
is
fringed
with
broad
sandy
beaches
describes
a
gentle
curve
inwards
the
broad
reach
of
the
para
in
front
of
this
coast
is
called
the
bahia
or
bay
of
marajo
the
coast
and
the
interior
of
the
land
are
peopled
by
civilised
indians
and
mamelucos
with
a
mixture
of
free
negroes
and
mulattos
they
are
poor
for
the
waters
are
not
abundant
in
fish
and
they
are
dependent
for
a
livelihood
solely
on
their
small
plantations
and
the
scant
supply
of
game
found
in
the
woods
the
district
was
originally
peopled
by
various
tribes
of
indians
of
whom
the
principal
were
the
tupinambas
and
nhengahibas
like
all
the
coast
tribes
whether
inhabiting
the
banks
of
the
amazons
or
the
seashore
between
para
and
bahia
they
were
far
more
advanced
in
civilisation
than
the
hordes
scattered
through
the
interior
of
the
country
some
of
which
still
remain
in
the
wild
state
between
the
amazons
and
the
plata
there
are
three
villages
on
the
coast
of
carnapijo
and
several
planters
houses
formerly
the
centres
of
flourishing
estates
which
have
now
relapsed
into
forest
in
consequence
of
the
scarcity
of
labour
and
diminished
enterprise
one
of
the
largest
of
these
establishments
is
called
caripi
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
it
belonged
to
a
scotch
gentleman
campbell
who
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
large
brazilian
proprietor
most
of
the
occasional
english
and
american
visitors
to
para
had
made
some
stay
at
caripi
and
it
had
obtained
quite
a
reputation
for
the
number
and
beauty
of
the
birds
and
insects
found
there
i
therefore
applied
for
and
obtained
permission
to
spend
two
or
three
months
at
the
place
the
distance
from
para
was
about
miles
round
by
the
northern
end
of
the
ilha
das
oncas
isle
of
tigers
which
faces
the
city
i
bargained
for
a
passage
thither
with
the
cabo
of
a
small
which
was
going
past
the
place
and
started
on
the
of
december
we
were
thirteen
persons
aboard
the
cabo
his
pretty
mulatto
mistress
the
pilot
and
five
indian
canoemen
three
young
mamelucos
who
were
taking
a
holiday
trip
to
cameta
a
heavily
chained
runaway
slave
and
myself
the
young
mamelucos
were
pleasant
gentle
fellows
they
could
read
and
write
and
amused
themselves
on
the
voyage
with
a
book
containing
descriptions
and
statistics
of
foreign
countries
in
which
they
seemed
to
take
great
interest
one
reading
while
the
others
listened
at
uirapiranga
a
small
island
behind
the
ilha
das
oncas
we
had
to
stop
a
short
time
to
embark
several
pipes
of
cashaca
at
a
sugar
estate
the
cabo
took
the
montaria
and
two
men
the
pipes
were
rolled
into
the
water
and
floated
to
the
canoe
the
men
passing
cables
round
and
towing
them
through
a
rough
sea
here
we
slept
and
the
following
morning
continuing
our
voyage
entered
a
narrow
channel
which
intersects
the
land
of
carnapijo
at
we
emerged
from
this
channel
which
is
called
the
aitituba
or
arrozal
into
the
broad
bahia
and
then
saw
two
or
three
miles
away
to
the
left
the
mansion
of
caripi
embosomed
in
woods
on
the
shores
of
a
charming
little
bay
the
water
is
very
shallow
near
the
shore
and
when
the
wind
blows
there
is
a
heavy
ground
swell
a
few
years
previously
an
english
gentleman
graham
an
amateur
naturalist
was
capsized
here
and
drowned
with
his
wife
and
child
while
passing
in
a
laden
montaria
to
his
large
canoe
remembering
their
fate
i
was
rather
alarmed
to
see
that
i
should
be
obliged
to
take
all
my
luggage
ashore
in
one
trip
in
a
leaky
little
boat
the
pile
of
chests
with
two
indians
and
myself
sank
the
montaria
almost
to
the
level
of
the
water
i
was
kept
busy
bailing
all
the
way
the
indians
manage
canoes
in
this
condition
with
admirable
skill
they
preserve
the
nicest
equilibrium
and
paddle
so
gently
that
not
the
slightest
oscillation
is
perceptible
on
landing
an
old
negress
named
florinda
the
feitora
or
manageress
of
the
establishment
which
was
kept
only
as
a
and
hospital
for
sick
slaves
gave
me
the
keys
and
i
forthwith
took
possession
of
the
rooms
i
required
i
remained
here
nine
weeks
or
until
the
of
february
the
house
was
very
large
and
most
substantially
built
but
consisted
of
only
one
story
i
was
told
it
was
built
by
the
jesuits
more
than
a
century
ago
the
front
had
no
veranda
the
doors
opening
upon
a
slightly
elevated
terrace
about
a
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
broad
sandy
beach
around
the
residence
the
ground
had
been
cleared
to
the
extent
of
two
or
three
acres
and
was
planted
with
fruit
trees
pathways
through
the
forest
led
to
little
colonies
of
the
natives
on
the
banks
of
retired
creeks
and
rivulets
in
the
interior
i
led
here
a
solitary
but
not
unpleasant
life
for
there
was
a
great
charm
in
the
loneliness
of
the
place
the
swell
of
the
river
beating
on
the
sloping
beach
caused
an
unceasing
murmur
which
lulled
me
to
sleep
at
night
and
seemed
appropriate
music
in
those
midday
hours
when
all
nature
was
pausing
breathless
under
the
rays
of
a
vertical
sun
here
i
spent
my
first
christmas
day
in
a
foreign
land
the
festival
was
celebrated
by
the
negroes
of
their
own
free
will
and
in
a
very
pleasing
manner
the
room
next
to
the
one
i
had
chosen
was
the
capella
or
chapel
it
had
a
little
altar
which
was
neatly
arranged
and
the
room
was
furnished
with
a
magnificent
brass
chandelier
men
women
and
children
were
busy
in
the
chapel
all
day
on
the
of
december
decorating
the
altar
with
flowers
and
strewing
the
floor
with
they
invited
some
of
their
neighbours
to
the
evening
prayers
and
when
the
simple
ceremony
began
an
hour
before
midnight
the
chapel
was
crowded
they
were
obliged
to
dispense
with
the
mass
for
they
had
no
priest
the
service
therefore
consisted
merely
of
a
long
litany
and
a
few
hymns
there
was
placed
on
the
altar
a
small
image
of
the
infant
christ
the
menino
deos
as
they
called
it
or
the
which
had
a
long
ribbon
depending
from
its
waist
an
old
negro
led
off
the
litany
and
the
rest
of
the
people
joined
in
the
responses
after
the
service
was
over
they
all
went
up
to
the
altar
one
by
one
and
kissed
the
end
of
the
ribbon
the
gravity
and
earnestness
shown
throughout
the
proceedings
were
remarkable
some
of
the
hymns
were
very
simple
and
beautiful
especially
one
beginning
virgensoberana
a
trace
of
whose
melody
springs
to
my
recollection
whenever
i
think
on
the
dreamy
solitude
of
caripi
the
next
day
after
i
arrived
two
and
boys
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
in
english
and
presently
their
father
made
his
appearance
they
proved
to
be
a
german
family
named
petzell
who
were
living
in
the
woods
indian
fashion
about
a
mile
from
caripi
petzell
explained
to
me
how
he
came
here
he
said
that
thirteen
years
ago
he
came
to
brazil
with
a
number
of
other
germans
under
engagement
to
serve
in
the
brazilian
army
when
his
time
had
expired
he
came
to
para
to
see
the
country
but
after
a
few
months
rambling
left
the
place
to
establish
himself
in
the
united
states
there
he
married
went
to
illinois
and
settled
as
farmer
near
louis
he
remained
on
his
farm
seven
or
eight
years
and
had
a
family
of
five
children
he
could
never
forget
however
the
free
and
perpetual
summer
of
the
banks
of
the
amazons
so
he
persuaded
his
wife
to
consent
to
break
up
their
home
in
north
america
and
migrate
to
para
no
one
can
imagine
the
difficulties
the
poor
fellow
had
to
go
through
before
reaching
the
land
of
his
choice
he
first
descended
the
mississippi
feeling
sure
that
a
passage
to
para
could
be
got
at
new
orleans
he
was
there
told
that
the
only
port
in
north
america
he
could
start
from
was
new
york
so
away
he
sailed
for
new
york
but
there
was
no
chance
of
a
vessel
sailing
thence
to
para
so
he
took
a
passage
to
demerara
as
bringing
him
at
any
rate
near
to
the
desired
land
there
is
no
communication
whatever
between
demerara
and
para
and
he
was
forced
to
remain
here
with
his
family
four
or
five
months
during
which
they
all
caught
the
yellow
fever
and
one
of
his
children
died
at
length
he
heard
of
a
small
coasting
vessel
going
to
cayenne
so
he
embarked
and
thereby
got
another
stage
nearer
the
end
of
his
journey
a
short
time
after
reaching
cayenne
he
shipped
in
a
schooner
that
was
going
to
para
or
rather
the
island
of
marajo
for
a
cargo
of
cattle
he
had
now
fixed
himself
after
all
his
wanderings
in
a
healthy
and
fertile
little
nook
on
the
banks
of
a
rivulet
near
caripi
built
himself
a
and
planted
a
large
patch
of
mandioca
and
indian
corn
he
seemed
to
be
quite
happy
but
his
wife
complained
much
of
the
want
of
wholesome
food
meat
and
wheaten
bread
i
asked
the
children
whether
they
liked
the
country
they
shook
their
heads
and
said
they
would
rather
be
in
illinois
petzell
told
me
that
his
indian
neighbours
treated
him
very
kindly
one
or
other
of
them
called
almost
every
day
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
and
they
had
helped
him
in
many
ways
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
the
tapuyos
and
said
if
you
treat
them
well
they
will
go
through
fire
to
serve
you
petzell
and
his
family
were
expert
so
i
employed
them
at
this
work
during
my
stay
at
caripi
the
daily
occurrences
here
were
after
a
uniform
fashion
i
rose
with
the
dawn
took
a
cup
of
coffee
and
then
sallied
forth
after
birds
at
ten
i
breakfasted
and
devoted
the
hours
from
ten
until
three
to
entomology
the
evening
was
occupied
in
preserving
and
storing
my
captures
petzell
and
i
sometimes
undertook
long
excursions
occupying
the
whole
day
our
neighbours
used
to
bring
me
all
the
quadrupeds
birds
reptiles
and
shells
they
met
with
and
so
altogether
i
was
enabled
to
acquire
a
good
collection
of
the
productions
of
the
district
the
first
few
nights
i
was
much
troubled
by
bats
the
room
where
i
slept
had
not
been
used
for
many
months
and
the
roof
was
open
to
the
tiles
and
rafters
the
first
night
i
slept
soundly
and
did
not
perceive
anything
unusual
but
on
the
next
i
was
aroused
about
midnight
by
the
rushing
noise
made
by
vast
hosts
of
bats
sweeping
about
the
room
the
air
was
alive
with
them
they
had
put
out
the
lamp
and
when
i
relighted
it
the
place
appeared
blackened
with
the
impish
multitudes
that
were
whirling
round
and
round
after
i
had
laid
about
well
with
a
stick
for
a
few
minutes
they
disappeared
amongst
the
tiles
but
when
all
was
still
again
they
returned
and
once
more
extinguished
the
light
i
took
no
further
notice
of
them
and
went
to
sleep
the
next
night
several
got
into
my
hammock
i
seized
them
as
they
were
crawling
over
me
and
dashed
them
against
the
wall
the
next
morning
i
found
a
wound
evidently
caused
by
a
bat
on
my
hip
this
was
rather
unpleasant
so
i
set
to
work
with
the
negroes
and
tried
to
exterminate
them
i
shot
a
great
many
as
they
hung
from
the
rafters
and
the
negroes
having
mounted
with
ladders
to
the
roof
outside
routed
out
from
beneath
the
caves
many
hundreds
of
them
including
young
broods
there
were
altogether
four
species
two
belonging
to
the
genus
dysopes
one
to
phyllostoma
and
the
fourth
to
glossophaga
by
far
the
greater
number
belonged
to
the
dysopes
perotis
a
species
having
very
large
ears
and
measuring
two
feet
from
tip
to
tip
of
the
wings
the
phyllostoma
was
a
small
kind
of
a
colour
streaked
with
white
down
the
back
and
having
a
fleshy
expansion
on
the
tip
of
the
nose
i
was
never
attacked
by
bats
except
on
this
occasion
the
fact
of
their
sucking
the
blood
of
persons
sleeping
from
wounds
which
they
make
in
the
toes
is
now
well
established
but
it
is
only
a
few
persons
who
are
subject
to
this
according
to
the
negroes
the
phyllostoma
is
the
only
kind
which
attacks
man
those
which
i
caught
crawling
over
me
were
dysopes
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
many
different
kinds
of
bats
have
this
propensity
one
day
i
was
occupied
searching
for
insects
in
the
bark
of
a
fallen
tree
when
i
saw
a
large
animal
advancing
towards
the
spot
it
came
within
a
dozen
yards
before
perceiving
me
i
had
no
weapon
with
me
but
an
old
chisel
and
was
getting
ready
to
defend
myself
if
it
should
make
a
spring
when
it
turned
around
hastily
and
trotted
off
i
did
not
obtain
a
very
distinct
view
of
it
but
i
could
see
its
colour
was
that
of
the
puma
or
american
lion
although
it
was
rather
too
small
for
that
species
the
puma
is
not
a
common
animal
in
the
amazons
forests
i
did
not
see
altogether
more
than
a
dozen
skins
in
the
possession
of
the
natives
the
fur
is
of
a
fawn
colour
on
account
of
its
hue
resembling
that
of
a
deer
common
in
the
forests
the
natives
call
it
the
the
old
zoologist
marcgrave
called
the
puma
the
cuguacuarana
probably
the
c
being
soft
a
misspelling
of
hence
the
name
cougouar
employed
by
french
zoologists
and
copied
in
most
works
on
natural
history
or
the
false
deer
that
is
an
animal
which
deceives
one
at
first
sight
by
its
superficial
resemblance
to
a
deer
the
hunters
are
not
at
all
afraid
of
it
and
speak
always
in
disparaging
terms
of
its
courage
of
the
jaguar
they
give
a
very
different
account
the
only
species
of
monkey
i
met
with
at
caripi
was
the
same
little
midas
already
mentioned
as
found
near
para
the
great
anteater
tamandua
of
the
natives
myrmecophaga
jubata
was
not
uncommon
here
after
the
first
few
weeks
of
residence
i
ran
short
of
fresh
provisions
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
had
sold
me
all
the
fowls
they
could
spare
i
had
not
yet
learned
to
eat
the
stale
and
stringy
which
is
the
staple
food
in
these
places
and
for
several
days
i
had
lived
on
roasted
bananas
and
farinha
florinda
asked
me
whether
i
could
eat
tamandua
i
told
her
almost
anything
in
the
shape
of
flesh
would
be
acceptable
so
the
same
day
she
went
with
an
old
negro
named
antonio
and
the
dogs
and
in
the
evening
brought
one
of
the
animals
the
meat
was
stewed
and
turned
out
very
good
something
like
goose
in
flavour
the
people
at
caripi
would
not
touch
a
morsel
saying
it
was
not
considered
fit
to
eat
in
these
parts
i
had
read
however
that
it
was
an
article
of
food
in
other
countries
of
south
america
during
the
next
two
or
three
weeks
whenever
we
were
short
of
fresh
meat
antonio
was
always
ready
for
a
small
reward
to
get
me
a
tamandua
but
one
day
he
came
to
me
in
great
distress
with
the
news
that
his
favourite
dog
atrevido
had
been
caught
in
the
grip
of
an
eater
and
was
killed
we
hastened
to
the
place
and
found
the
dog
was
not
dead
but
severely
torn
by
the
claws
of
the
animal
which
itself
was
mortally
wounded
and
was
now
relaxing
its
grasp
the
habits
of
the
myrmecophaga
jubata
are
now
pretty
well
known
it
is
not
uncommon
in
the
drier
forests
of
the
amazons
valley
but
is
not
found
i
believe
in
the
ygapo
or
flooded
lands
the
brazilians
call
the
species
the
tamandua
bandeira
or
the
banner
anteater
the
term
banner
being
applied
in
allusion
to
the
curious
colouration
of
the
animal
each
side
of
the
body
having
a
broad
oblique
stripe
half
grey
and
half
black
which
gives
it
some
resemblance
to
a
heraldic
banner
it
has
an
excessively
long
slender
muzzle
and
a
wormlike
extensile
tongue
its
jaws
are
destitute
of
teeth
the
claws
are
much
elongated
and
its
gait
is
very
awkward
it
lives
on
the
ground
and
feeds
on
termites
or
white
ants
the
long
claws
being
employed
to
pull
in
pieces
the
solid
hillocks
made
by
the
insects
and
the
long
flexible
tongue
to
lick
them
up
from
the
crevices
all
the
other
species
of
this
singular
genus
are
arboreal
i
met
with
four
species
altogether
one
was
the
myrmecophaga
tetradactyla
the
two
others
more
curious
and
less
known
were
very
small
kinds
called
both
are
similar
in
size
ten
inches
in
length
exclusive
of
the
tail
and
in
the
number
of
the
claws
having
two
of
unequal
length
to
the
anterior
feet
and
four
to
the
hind
feet
one
species
is
clothed
with
silky
hair
this
is
of
rare
occurrence
the
other
has
a
fur
of
a
dingy
brown
colour
without
silky
lustre
one
was
brought
to
me
alive
at
caripi
having
been
caught
by
an
indian
clinging
motionless
inside
a
hollow
tree
i
kept
it
in
the
house
about
hours
it
had
a
moderately
long
snout
curved
downwards
and
extremely
small
eyes
it
remained
nearly
all
the
time
without
motion
except
when
irritated
in
which
case
it
reared
itself
on
its
hind
legs
from
the
back
of
a
chair
to
which
it
clung
and
clawed
out
with
its
forepaws
like
a
cat
its
manner
of
clinging
with
its
claws
and
the
sluggishness
of
its
motions
gave
it
a
great
resemblance
to
a
sloth
it
uttered
no
sound
and
remained
all
night
on
the
spot
where
i
had
placed
it
in
the
morning
the
next
day
i
put
it
on
a
tree
in
the
open
air
and
at
night
it
escaped
these
small
tamanduas
are
nocturnal
in
their
habits
and
feed
on
those
species
of
termites
which
construct
earthy
nests
that
look
like
ugly
excrescences
on
the
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
the
different
kinds
of
are
thus
adapted
to
various
modes
of
life
terrestrial
and
arboreal
those
which
live
on
trees
are
again
either
diurnal
or
nocturnal
for
myrmecophaga
tetradactyla
is
seen
moving
along
the
main
branches
in
the
daytime
the
allied
group
of
the
sloths
which
are
still
more
exclusively
south
american
forms
than
are
at
the
present
time
furnish
arboreal
species
only
but
formerly
terrestrial
forms
of
sloths
also
existed
as
the
megatherium
whose
mode
of
life
was
a
puzzle
seeing
that
it
was
of
too
colossal
a
size
to
live
on
trees
until
owen
showed
how
it
might
have
obtained
its
food
from
the
ground
in
january
the
became
covered
with
blossom
at
least
to
a
greater
extent
than
usual
for
they
flower
more
or
less
in
this
country
all
the
year
round
and
attracting
a
great
number
of
hummingbirds
every
day
in
the
cooler
hours
of
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
from
four
until
six
they
were
to
be
seen
whirring
about
the
trees
by
scores
their
motions
are
unlike
those
of
all
other
birds
they
dart
to
and
fro
so
swiftly
that
the
eye
can
scarcely
follow
them
and
when
they
stop
before
a
flower
it
is
only
for
a
few
moments
they
poise
themselves
in
an
unsteady
manner
their
wings
moving
with
inconceivable
rapidity
probe
the
flower
and
then
shoot
off
to
another
part
of
the
tree
they
do
not
proceed
in
that
methodical
manner
which
bees
follow
taking
the
flowers
seriatim
but
skip
about
from
one
part
of
the
tree
to
another
in
the
most
capricious
way
sometimes
two
males
close
with
each
other
and
fight
mounting
upwards
in
the
struggle
as
insects
are
often
seen
to
do
when
similarly
engaged
and
then
separating
hastily
and
darting
back
to
their
work
now
and
then
they
stop
to
rest
perching
on
leafless
twigs
where
they
may
be
sometimes
seen
probing
from
the
places
where
they
sit
the
flowers
within
their
reach
the
brilliant
colours
with
which
they
are
adorned
can
not
be
seen
whilst
they
are
fluttering
about
nor
can
the
different
species
be
distinguished
unless
they
have
a
deal
of
white
hue
in
their
plumage
such
as
heliothrix
auritus
which
is
wholly
white
underneath
although
of
a
glittering
green
colour
above
and
the
florisuga
mellivora
there
is
not
a
great
variety
of
hummingbirds
in
the
amazons
region
the
number
of
species
being
far
smaller
in
these
uniform
forest
plains
than
in
the
diversified
valleys
of
the
andes
under
the
same
parallels
of
latitude
the
family
is
divisible
into
two
groups
contrasted
in
form
and
habits
one
containing
species
which
live
entirely
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
and
the
other
comprising
those
which
prefer
open
sunny
places
the
forest
species
phaethorninae
are
seldom
seen
at
flowers
flowers
being
in
the
shady
places
where
they
abide
of
rare
occurrence
but
they
search
for
insects
on
leaves
threading
the
bushes
and
passing
above
and
beneath
each
leaf
with
wonderful
rapidity
the
other
group
trochilinae
are
not
quite
confined
to
cleared
places
as
they
come
into
the
forest
wherever
a
tree
is
in
blossom
and
descend
into
sunny
openings
where
flowers
are
to
be
found
but
it
is
only
where
the
woods
are
less
dense
than
usual
that
this
is
the
case
in
the
lofty
forests
and
twilight
shades
of
the
lowlands
and
islands
they
are
scarcely
ever
seen
i
searched
well
at
caripi
expecting
to
find
the
lophornis
gouldii
which
i
was
told
had
been
obtained
in
the
locality
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
hummingbirds
having
round
the
neck
a
frill
of
long
white
feathers
tipped
with
golden
green
i
was
not
however
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
with
it
several
times
i
shot
by
mistake
a
hummingbird
instead
of
a
bird
this
moth
macroglossa
titan
is
somewhat
smaller
than
hummingbirds
generally
are
but
its
manner
of
flight
and
the
way
it
poises
itself
before
a
flower
whilst
probing
it
with
its
proboscis
are
precisely
like
the
same
actions
of
hummingbirds
it
was
only
after
many
days
experience
that
i
learned
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
when
on
the
wing
this
resemblance
has
attracted
the
notice
of
the
natives
all
of
whom
even
educated
whites
firmly
believe
that
one
is
transmutable
into
the
other
they
have
observed
the
metamorphosis
of
caterpillars
into
butterflies
and
think
it
not
at
all
more
wonderful
that
a
moth
should
change
into
a
hummingbird
the
resemblance
between
this
and
a
hummingbird
is
certainly
very
curious
and
strikes
one
even
when
both
are
examined
in
the
hand
holding
them
sideways
the
shape
of
the
head
and
position
of
the
eyes
in
the
moth
are
seen
to
be
nearly
the
same
as
in
the
bird
the
extended
proboscis
representing
the
long
beak
at
the
tip
of
the
moth
body
there
is
a
brush
of
long
resembling
feathers
which
being
expanded
looks
very
much
like
a
bird
tail
but
of
course
all
these
points
of
resemblance
are
merely
superficial
the
negroes
and
indians
tried
to
convince
me
that
the
two
were
of
the
same
species
look
at
their
feathers
they
said
their
eyes
are
the
same
and
so
are
their
tails
this
belief
is
so
deeply
rooted
that
it
was
useless
to
reason
with
them
on
the
subject
the
macroglossa
moths
are
found
in
most
countries
and
have
everywhere
the
same
habits
one
species
is
found
in
england
gould
relates
that
he
once
had
a
stormy
altercation
with
an
english
gentleman
who
affirmed
that
hummingbirds
were
found
in
england
for
he
had
seen
one
flying
in
devonshire
meaning
thereby
the
moth
macroglossa
stellatarum
the
analogy
between
the
two
creatures
has
been
brought
about
probably
by
the
similarity
of
their
habits
there
being
no
indication
of
the
one
having
been
adapted
in
outward
appearance
with
reference
to
the
other
it
has
been
observed
that
hummingbirds
are
unlike
other
birds
in
their
mental
qualities
resembling
in
this
respect
insects
rather
than
vertebrate
animals
the
want
of
expression
in
their
eyes
the
small
degree
of
versatility
in
their
actions
the
quickness
and
precision
of
their
movements
are
all
so
many
points
of
resemblance
between
them
and
insects
in
walking
along
the
alleys
of
the
forest
a
phaethornis
frequently
crosses
one
path
often
stopping
suddenly
and
remaining
poised
in
midair
a
few
feet
distant
from
the
face
of
the
intruder
the
phaethorninae
are
certainly
more
numerousin
the
amazons
region
that
the
trochilinae
they
build
their
nests
which
are
made
of
fine
vegetable
fibres
and
lichens
densely
woven
together
and
thickly
lined
with
from
the
fruit
of
the
samauma
tree
eriodendron
samauma
and
on
the
inner
sides
lined
with
of
the
tips
of
they
are
long
and
purseshaped
the
young
when
first
hatched
have
very
much
shorter
bills
than
their
parents
the
only
species
of
trochilinae
which
i
found
at
caripi
were
the
little
polytmus
viridissimus
the
sapphire
and
emerald
thalurania
furcata
and
the
large
campylopterus
obscurus
snakes
were
very
numerous
at
caripi
many
harmless
species
were
found
near
the
house
and
these
sometimes
came
into
the
rooms
i
was
wandering
one
day
amongst
the
green
bushes
of
guajara
a
tree
which
yields
a
berry
chrysobalanus
icaco
and
grows
along
all
these
sandy
shores
when
i
was
startled
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
flexuous
stem
of
a
creeping
plant
endowed
with
life
and
threading
its
way
amongst
the
leaves
and
branches
this
animated
liana
turned
out
to
be
a
snake
the
dryophis
fulgida
its
whole
body
is
of
the
same
green
hue
and
it
is
thus
rendered
undistinguishable
amidst
the
foliage
of
the
guajara
bushes
where
it
prowls
in
search
of
its
prey
treefrogs
and
lizards
the
forepart
of
its
head
is
prolonged
into
a
slender
pointed
beak
and
the
total
length
of
the
reptile
was
six
feet
there
was
another
kind
found
amongst
bushes
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
closely
allied
to
this
but
much
more
slender
the
dryophis
acuminata
this
grows
to
a
length
of
four
feet
eight
inches
the
tail
alone
being
inches
but
the
diameter
of
the
thickest
part
of
the
body
is
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
it
is
of
colour
with
iridescent
shades
variegated
with
obscurer
markings
and
looks
like
a
piece
of
whipcord
one
individual
which
i
caught
of
this
species
had
a
protuberance
near
the
middle
of
the
body
upon
opening
it
i
found
a
lizard
which
was
much
more
bulky
than
the
snake
itself
another
kind
of
serpent
found
here
a
species
of
helicops
was
amphibiousin
its
habits
i
saw
several
of
this
in
wet
weather
on
the
beach
which
on
being
approached
always
made
straightway
for
the
water
where
they
swamwith
much
grace
and
dexterity
florinda
one
day
caught
a
helicops
while
angling
for
fish
it
having
swallowed
the
fishhook
with
the
bait
she
and
others
told
me
these
lived
on
small
fishes
but
i
did
not
meet
with
any
proof
of
the
statement
in
the
woods
snakes
were
constantly
occurring
it
was
not
often
however
that
i
saw
poisonous
species
there
were
many
arboreal
kinds
besides
the
two
just
mentioned
and
it
was
rather
alarming
in
entomologising
about
the
trunks
of
trees
to
suddenly
encounter
on
turning
round
as
sometimes
happened
a
pair
of
glittering
eyes
and
a
forked
tongue
within
a
few
inches
of
one
head
the
last
kind
i
shall
mention
is
the
which
is
a
most
beautiful
object
when
seen
coiled
up
on
black
soil
in
the
woods
the
one
i
saw
here
was
banded
with
black
and
vermilion
the
black
bands
having
each
two
clear
white
rings
the
state
of
specimens
preserved
in
spirits
can
give
no
idea
of
the
brilliant
colours
which
adorn
the
in
life
petzell
and
i
as
already
mentioned
made
many
excursions
of
long
extent
in
the
neighbouring
forest
we
sometimes
went
to
murucupi
a
creek
which
passes
through
the
forest
about
four
miles
behind
caripi
the
banks
of
which
are
inhabited
by
indians
and
breeds
who
have
lived
there
for
many
generations
in
perfect
seclusion
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
place
being
little
known
or
frequented
a
path
from
caripi
leads
to
it
through
a
gloomy
tract
of
virgin
forest
where
the
trees
are
so
closely
packed
together
that
the
ground
beneath
is
thrown
into
the
deepest
shade
under
which
nothing
but
fetid
fungi
and
rotting
vegetable
debris
is
to
be
seen
on
emerging
from
this
unfriendly
solitude
near
the
banks
of
the
murucupi
a
charming
contrast
is
presented
a
glorious
vegetation
piled
up
to
an
immense
height
clothes
the
banks
of
the
creek
which
traverses
a
broad
tract
of
ground
and
the
varied
masses
of
greenery
are
lighted
up
with
the
sunny
glow
open
huts
peep
forth
here
and
there
from
amidst
groves
of
banana
mango
cotton
and
papaw
trees
and
palms
on
our
first
excursion
we
struck
the
banks
of
the
river
in
front
of
a
house
of
somewhat
more
substantial
architecture
than
the
rest
having
finished
mud
walls
that
were
plastered
and
whitewashed
and
had
a
covering
of
red
tiles
it
seemed
to
be
full
of
children
and
the
aspect
of
the
household
was
improved
by
a
number
of
mameluco
women
who
were
busily
employed
washing
spinning
and
making
farinha
two
of
them
seated
on
a
mat
in
the
open
verandah
were
engaged
sewing
dresses
for
a
festival
was
going
to
take
place
a
few
days
hence
at
balcarem
a
village
eight
miles
distant
from
murucupi
and
they
intended
to
be
present
to
hear
mass
and
show
their
finery
one
of
the
children
a
naked
boy
about
seven
years
of
age
crossed
over
with
the
montaria
to
fetch
us
we
were
made
welcome
at
once
and
asked
to
stay
for
dinner
on
our
accepting
the
invitation
a
couple
of
fowls
were
killed
and
a
wholesome
stew
of
seasoned
rice
and
fowls
soon
put
into
preparation
it
is
not
often
that
the
female
members
of
a
family
in
these
retired
places
are
familiar
with
strangers
but
these
people
had
lived
a
long
time
in
the
capital
and
therefore
were
more
civilised
than
their
neighbours
their
father
had
been
a
prosperous
tradesman
and
had
given
them
the
best
education
the
place
afforded
after
his
death
the
widow
with
several
daughters
married
and
unmarried
retired
to
this
secluded
spot
which
had
been
their
sitio
farm
or
for
many
years
one
of
the
daughters
was
married
to
a
handsome
young
mulatto
who
was
present
and
sang
us
some
pretty
songs
accompanying
himself
on
the
guitar
after
dinner
i
expressed
a
wish
to
see
more
of
the
creek
so
a
lively
and
polite
old
man
whom
i
took
to
be
one
of
the
neighbours
volunteered
as
guide
we
embarked
in
a
little
montaria
and
paddled
some
three
or
four
miles
up
and
down
the
stream
although
i
had
now
become
familiarised
with
beautiful
vegetation
all
the
glow
of
fresh
admiration
came
again
to
me
in
this
place
the
creek
was
about
a
hundred
yards
wide
but
narrower
in
some
places
both
banks
were
masked
by
lofty
walls
of
green
drapery
here
and
there
a
break
occurring
through
which
under
overarching
trees
glimpses
were
obtained
of
the
thatched
huts
of
settlers
the
projecting
boughs
of
lofty
trees
which
in
some
places
stretched
across
the
creek
were
hung
with
natural
garlands
and
festoons
and
an
endless
variety
of
creeping
plants
clothed
the
some
of
which
especially
the
bignonias
were
ornamented
with
large
coloured
flowers
art
could
not
have
assorted
together
beautiful
vegetable
forms
so
harmoniously
as
was
here
done
by
nature
palms
as
usual
formed
a
large
proportion
of
the
lower
trees
some
of
them
however
shot
up
their
slim
stems
to
a
height
of
sixty
feet
or
more
and
waved
their
bunches
of
nodding
plumes
between
us
and
the
sky
one
kind
of
palm
the
pashiuba
iriartea
exorhiza
which
grows
here
in
greater
abundance
than
elsewhere
was
especially
attractive
it
is
not
one
of
the
tallest
kinds
for
when
its
height
is
not
more
perhaps
than
forty
feet
the
leaves
are
somewhat
less
drooping
and
the
leaflets
much
broader
than
in
other
species
so
that
they
have
not
that
feathery
appearance
which
those
of
some
palms
have
but
still
they
possess
their
own
peculiar
beauty
my
guide
put
me
ashore
in
one
place
to
show
me
the
roots
of
the
pashiuba
these
grow
above
ground
radiating
from
the
trunk
many
feet
above
the
surface
so
that
the
tree
looks
as
if
supported
on
stilts
and
a
person
can
in
old
trees
stand
upright
amongst
the
roots
with
the
perpendicular
stem
wholly
above
his
head
it
adds
to
the
singularity
of
their
appearance
that
these
roots
which
have
the
form
of
straight
rods
are
studded
with
stout
thorns
while
the
trunk
of
the
tree
is
quite
smooth
the
purpose
of
this
curious
arrangement
is
perhaps
similar
to
that
of
the
buttress
roots
already
described
namely
to
recompense
the
tree
by
above
the
soil
for
its
inability
in
consequence
of
the
competition
of
neighbouring
roots
to
extend
it
underground
the
great
amount
of
moisture
and
nutriment
contained
in
the
atmosphere
may
also
favour
these
growths
on
returning
to
the
house
i
found
petzell
had
been
well
occupied
during
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
collecting
insects
in
a
neighbouring
clearing
our
kind
hosts
gave
us
a
cup
of
coffee
about
five
and
we
then
started
for
home
the
last
mile
of
our
walk
was
performed
in
the
dark
the
forest
in
this
part
is
obscure
even
in
broad
daylight
but
i
was
scarcely
prepared
for
the
intense
opacity
of
darkness
which
reigned
here
on
this
night
and
which
prevented
us
from
seeing
each
other
while
walking
side
by
side
nothing
occurred
of
a
nature
to
alarm
us
except
that
now
and
then
a
sudden
rush
was
heard
among
the
trees
and
once
a
dismal
shriek
startled
us
petzell
tripped
at
one
place
and
fell
all
his
length
into
the
thicket
with
this
exception
we
kept
well
to
the
pathway
and
in
due
time
arrived
safely
at
caripi
one
of
my
neighbours
at
murucupi
was
a
hunter
of
reputation
in
these
parts
he
was
a
civilised
indian
married
and
settled
named
raimundo
whose
habit
was
to
sally
forth
at
intervals
to
certain
productive
the
situation
of
which
he
kept
secret
and
procure
fresh
provisions
for
his
family
i
had
found
out
by
this
time
that
animal
food
was
as
much
a
necessary
of
life
in
this
exhausting
climate
as
it
is
in
the
north
of
europe
an
attempt
which
i
made
to
live
on
vegetable
food
was
quite
a
failure
and
i
could
not
eat
the
execrable
which
brazilians
use
i
had
been
many
days
without
meat
of
any
kind
and
nothing
more
was
to
be
found
near
caripi
so
i
asked
as
a
favour
of
senor
raimundo
permission
to
accompany
him
on
one
of
his
and
shoot
a
little
game
for
my
own
use
he
consented
and
appointed
a
day
on
which
i
was
to
come
over
to
his
house
to
sleep
so
as
to
be
ready
for
starting
with
the
shortly
after
midnight
the
locality
we
were
to
visit
was
situated
near
the
extreme
point
of
the
land
of
carnapijo
where
it
projects
northwardly
into
the
middle
of
the
para
estuary
and
is
broken
into
a
number
of
islands
on
the
afternoon
of
january
i
walked
through
the
woods
to
raimundo
house
taking
nothing
with
me
but
a
gun
a
supply
of
ammunition
and
a
box
for
the
reception
of
any
insects
i
might
capture
raimundo
was
a
carpenter
and
seemed
to
be
a
very
industrious
man
he
had
two
apprentices
indians
like
himself
one
a
young
lad
and
the
other
apparently
about
twenty
years
of
age
his
wife
was
of
the
same
race
the
indian
women
are
not
always
of
a
taciturn
disposition
like
their
husbands
senora
dominga
was
very
talkative
there
was
another
old
squaw
at
the
house
on
a
visit
and
the
tongues
of
the
two
were
going
at
a
great
rate
the
whole
evening
using
only
the
tupi
language
raimundo
and
his
apprentices
were
employed
building
a
canoe
notwithstanding
his
industry
he
seemed
to
be
very
poor
and
this
was
the
condition
of
most
of
the
residents
on
the
banks
of
the
murucupi
they
have
nevertheless
considerable
plantations
of
mandioca
and
indian
corn
besides
small
plots
of
cotton
coffee
and
sugarcane
the
soil
is
very
fertile
they
have
no
rent
to
pay
and
no
direct
taxes
there
is
moreover
always
a
market
in
para
twenty
miles
distant
for
their
surplus
produce
and
a
ready
communication
with
it
by
water
in
the
evening
we
had
more
visitors
the
sounds
of
pipe
and
tabor
were
heard
and
presently
a
procession
of
villagers
emerged
from
a
pathway
through
the
mandioca
fields
they
were
on
a
begging
expedition
for
thome
the
patron
saint
of
indians
and
mamelucos
one
carried
a
banner
on
which
was
crudely
painted
the
figure
of
thome
with
a
glory
round
his
head
the
pipe
and
tabor
were
of
the
simplest
description
the
pipe
was
a
reed
pierced
with
four
holes
by
means
of
which
a
few
unmusical
notes
were
produced
and
the
tabor
was
a
broad
hoop
with
a
skin
stretched
over
each
end
a
deformed
young
man
played
both
the
instruments
senor
raimundo
received
them
with
the
quiet
politeness
which
comes
so
naturally
to
the
indian
when
occupying
the
position
of
host
the
visitors
who
had
come
from
the
villa
de
conde
five
miles
through
the
forest
were
invited
to
rest
raimundo
then
took
the
image
of
thome
from
one
of
the
party
and
placed
it
by
the
side
of
nossa
senhora
in
his
own
oratorio
a
little
decorated
box
in
which
every
family
keeps
its
household
gods
finally
lighting
a
couple
of
wax
candles
before
it
shortly
afterwards
a
cloth
was
laid
on
a
mat
and
all
the
guests
were
invited
to
supper
the
fare
was
very
scanty
a
boiled
fowl
with
rice
a
slice
of
roasted
pirarucu
farinha
and
bananas
each
one
partook
very
sparingly
some
of
the
young
men
contenting
themselves
with
a
plateful
of
rice
one
of
the
apprentices
stood
behind
with
a
bowl
of
water
and
a
towel
with
which
each
guest
washed
his
fingers
and
rinsed
his
mouth
after
the
meal
they
stayed
all
night
the
large
open
shed
was
filled
with
hammocks
which
were
slung
from
pole
to
pole
and
upon
retiring
raimundo
gave
orders
for
their
breakfast
in
the
morning
raimundo
called
me
at
two
when
we
embarked
he
his
older
apprentice
joaquim
and
myself
in
a
shady
place
where
it
was
so
dark
that
i
could
see
neither
canoe
nor
water
taking
with
us
five
dogs
we
glided
down
a
winding
creek
where
huge
trunks
of
trees
slanted
across
close
overhead
and
presently
emerged
into
the
murucupi
a
few
yards
further
on
we
entered
the
broader
channel
of
the
aitituba
this
we
crossed
and
entered
another
narrow
creek
on
the
opposite
side
here
the
was
against
us
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
making
progress
after
we
had
struggled
against
the
powerful
current
a
distance
of
two
miles
we
came
to
a
part
where
the
ran
in
the
opposite
direction
showing
that
we
had
crossed
the
watershed
the
tide
flows
into
this
channel
or
creek
at
both
ends
simultaneously
and
meets
in
the
middle
although
there
is
apparently
no
difference
of
level
and
the
breadth
of
the
water
is
the
same
the
tides
are
extremely
intricate
throughout
all
the
infinite
channels
and
creeks
which
intersect
the
lands
of
the
amazons
delta
the
moon
now
broke
forth
and
lighted
up
the
trunks
of
colossal
trees
the
leaves
of
monstrous
jupati
palms
which
arched
over
the
creek
and
revealed
groups
of
arborescent
arums
standing
like
rows
of
spectres
on
its
banks
we
had
a
glimpse
now
and
then
into
the
black
depths
of
the
forest
where
all
was
silent
except
the
shrill
stridulation
of
now
and
then
a
sudden
plunge
in
the
water
ahead
would
startle
us
caused
by
heavy
fruit
or
some
nocturnal
animal
dropping
from
the
trees
the
two
indians
here
rested
on
their
paddles
and
allowed
the
canoe
to
drift
with
the
tide
a
pleasant
perfume
came
from
the
forest
which
raimundo
said
proceeded
from
a
he
told
me
that
all
this
land
was
owned
by
large
proprietors
at
para
who
had
received
grants
from
time
to
time
from
the
government
for
political
services
raimundo
was
quite
in
a
talkative
humour
he
related
to
me
many
incidents
of
the
time
of
the
cabanagem
as
the
revolutionary
days
of
are
popularly
called
he
said
he
had
been
much
suspected
himself
of
being
a
rebel
but
declared
that
the
suspicion
was
unfounded
the
only
complaint
he
had
to
make
against
the
white
man
was
that
he
monopolised
the
land
without
having
any
intention
or
prospect
of
cultivating
it
he
had
been
turned
out
of
one
place
where
he
had
squatted
and
cleared
a
large
piece
of
forest
i
believe
the
law
of
brazil
at
this
time
was
that
the
new
lands
should
become
the
property
of
those
who
cleared
and
cultivated
them
if
their
right
was
not
disputed
within
a
given
term
of
years
by
some
one
who
claimed
the
proprietorship
this
has
since
been
repealed
and
a
new
one
adopted
founded
on
that
of
the
united
states
raimundo
spoke
of
his
race
as
the
redskins
pelle
vermelho
they
meant
well
to
the
whites
and
only
begged
to
be
let
alone
god
he
said
had
given
room
enough
for
us
all
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
the
shrewd
fellow
talk
in
this
strain
our
companion
joaquim
had
fallen
asleep
the
night
air
was
cool
and
the
moonlight
lit
up
the
features
of
raimundo
revealing
a
more
animated
expression
than
is
usually
observable
in
indian
countenances
i
always
noticed
that
indians
were
more
cheerful
on
a
voyage
especially
in
the
cool
hours
of
night
and
morning
than
when
ashore
there
is
something
in
their
constitution
of
body
which
makes
them
feel
excessively
depressed
in
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
especially
inside
their
houses
their
skin
is
always
hot
to
the
touch
they
certainly
do
not
endure
the
heat
of
their
own
climate
so
well
as
the
whites
the
negroes
are
totally
different
in
this
respect
the
heat
of
midday
has
very
little
effect
on
them
and
they
dislike
the
cold
nights
on
the
river
we
arrived
at
our
about
four
the
channel
was
broader
here
and
presented
several
ramifications
it
yet
wanted
an
hour
and
a
half
to
daybreak
so
raimundo
recommended
me
to
have
a
nap
we
both
stretched
ourselves
on
the
benches
of
the
canoe
and
fell
asleep
letting
the
boat
drift
with
the
tide
which
was
now
slack
i
slept
well
considering
the
hardness
of
our
bed
and
when
i
awoke
in
the
middle
of
a
dream
about
the
day
was
beginning
to
dawn
my
clothes
were
quite
wet
with
the
dew
the
birds
were
astir
the
cicadas
had
begun
their
music
and
the
urania
leilus
a
strange
and
beautiful
tailed
and
gilded
moth
whose
habits
are
those
of
a
butterfly
commenced
to
fly
in
flocks
over
the
tops
raimundo
exclaimed
clareia
o
dia
the
day
brightens
the
change
was
rapid
the
sky
in
the
east
assumed
suddenly
the
loveliest
azure
colour
across
which
streaks
of
thin
white
clouds
were
painted
it
is
at
such
moments
as
this
when
one
feels
how
beautiful
our
earth
truly
is
the
channel
on
whose
waters
our
little
boat
was
floating
was
about
two
hundred
yards
wide
others
branched
off
right
and
left
surrounding
the
group
of
lonely
islands
which
terminate
the
land
of
carnapijo
the
forest
on
all
sides
formed
a
lofty
hedge
without
a
break
below
it
was
fringed
with
mangrove
bushes
whose
small
foliage
contrasted
with
the
large
glossy
leaves
of
the
taller
trees
or
the
feather
and
shaped
fronds
of
palms
being
now
arrived
at
our
destination
raimundo
turned
up
his
trousers
and
took
his
long
and
leapt
ashore
with
the
dogs
he
had
to
cut
a
gap
in
order
to
enter
the
forest
we
expected
to
find
pacas
and
cutias
and
the
method
adopted
to
secure
them
was
this
at
the
present
early
hour
they
would
be
seen
feeding
on
fallen
fruits
but
would
quickly
on
hearing
a
noise
betake
themselves
to
their
burrows
raimundo
was
then
to
turn
them
out
by
means
of
the
dogs
and
joaquim
and
i
were
to
remain
in
the
boat
with
our
guns
ready
to
shoot
all
that
came
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
the
habits
of
both
animals
when
being
to
take
to
the
water
we
had
not
long
to
wait
the
first
arrival
was
a
paca
a
reddish
nearly
rodent
spotted
with
white
on
the
sides
and
intermediate
in
size
and
appearance
between
a
hog
and
a
hare
my
first
shot
did
not
take
effect
the
animal
dived
into
the
water
and
did
not
reappear
a
second
was
brought
down
by
my
companion
as
it
was
rambling
about
under
the
mangrove
bushes
a
cutia
next
appeared
this
is
also
a
rodent
about
the
size
of
the
paca
it
swims
but
does
not
dive
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
shoot
it
we
obtained
in
this
way
two
more
pacas
and
another
cutia
all
the
time
the
dogs
were
yelping
in
the
forest
shortly
afterwards
raimundo
made
his
appearance
and
told
us
to
paddle
to
the
other
side
of
the
island
arrived
there
we
landed
and
prepared
for
breakfast
it
was
a
pretty
spot
a
clean
white
sandy
beach
beneath
the
shade
of
trees
joaquim
made
a
fire
he
first
scraped
fine
shavings
from
the
midrib
of
a
bacaba
these
he
piled
into
a
little
heap
in
a
dry
place
and
then
struck
a
light
in
his
bamboo
tinderbox
with
a
piece
of
an
old
file
and
a
flint
the
tinder
being
a
substance
manufactured
by
an
ant
polyrhachis
bispinosus
by
gentle
blowing
the
shavings
ignited
dry
sticks
were
piled
on
them
and
a
good
fire
soon
resulted
he
then
singed
and
prepared
the
cutia
finishing
by
running
a
spit
through
the
body
and
fixing
one
end
in
the
ground
in
a
slanting
position
over
the
fire
we
had
brought
with
us
a
bag
of
farinha
and
a
cup
containing
a
lemon
a
dozen
or
two
of
fiery
red
peppers
and
a
few
spoonsful
of
salt
we
breakfasted
heartily
when
our
cutia
was
roasted
and
washed
the
meal
down
with
a
calabash
full
of
the
pure
water
of
the
river
after
breakfast
the
dogs
found
another
cutia
which
was
hidden
in
its
burrow
two
or
three
feet
beneath
the
roots
of
a
large
tree
and
it
took
raimundo
nearly
an
hour
to
disinter
it
soon
afterwards
we
left
this
place
crossed
the
channel
and
paddling
past
two
islands
obtained
a
glimpse
of
the
broad
river
between
them
with
a
long
sandy
spit
on
which
stood
several
scarlet
ibises
and
egrets
one
of
the
islands
was
low
and
sandy
and
half
of
it
was
covered
with
gigantic
the
caladium
arborescens
which
presented
a
strange
sight
most
people
are
acquainted
with
the
little
british
species
arum
maculatum
which
grows
in
and
many
doubtless
have
admired
the
larger
kinds
grown
in
hothouses
they
can
therefore
form
some
idea
of
a
forest
of
arums
on
this
islet
the
woody
stems
of
the
plants
near
the
bottom
were
eight
to
ten
inches
in
diameter
and
the
trees
were
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
high
all
growing
together
in
such
a
manner
that
there
was
just
room
for
a
man
to
walk
freely
between
them
there
was
a
canoe
inshore
with
a
man
and
a
woman
the
man
who
was
hooting
with
all
his
might
told
us
in
passing
that
his
son
was
lost
in
the
aningal
he
had
strayed
while
walking
ashore
and
the
father
had
now
been
an
hour
waiting
for
him
in
vain
about
one
we
again
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
a
little
creek
it
was
now
intensely
hot
raimundo
said
deer
were
found
here
so
he
borrowed
my
gun
as
being
a
more
effective
weapon
than
the
wretched
arms
called
lazarinos
which
he
in
common
with
all
the
native
hunters
used
and
which
sell
at
para
for
seven
or
eight
shillings
apiece
raimundo
and
joaquim
now
stripped
themselves
quite
naked
and
started
off
in
different
directions
through
the
forest
going
naked
in
order
to
move
with
less
noise
over
the
carpet
of
dead
leaves
among
which
they
stepped
so
stealthily
that
not
the
slightest
rustle
could
be
heard
the
dogs
remained
in
the
canoe
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
i
employed
myself
two
hours
entomologising
at
the
end
of
that
time
my
two
companions
returned
having
met
with
no
game
whatever
we
now
embarked
on
our
return
voyage
raimundo
cut
two
slender
poles
one
for
a
mast
and
the
other
for
a
sprit
to
these
he
rigged
a
sail
we
had
brought
in
the
boat
for
we
were
to
return
by
the
open
river
and
expected
a
good
wind
to
carry
us
to
caripi
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
the
channel
we
began
to
feel
the
wind
the
which
here
makes
a
clean
sweep
from
the
atlantic
our
boat
was
very
small
and
heavily
laden
and
when
after
rounding
a
point
i
saw
the
great
breadth
we
had
to
traverse
seven
miles
i
thought
the
attempt
to
cross
in
such
a
slight
vessel
foolhardy
in
the
extreme
the
waves
ran
very
high
there
was
no
rudder
raimundo
steered
with
a
paddle
and
all
we
had
to
rely
upon
to
save
us
from
falling
into
the
trough
of
the
sea
and
being
instantly
swamped
were
his
nerve
and
skill
there
was
just
room
in
the
boat
for
our
three
selves
the
dogs
and
the
game
we
had
killed
and
when
between
the
swelling
ridges
of
waves
in
so
frail
a
shell
our
destruction
seemed
inevitable
as
it
was
we
shipped
a
little
water
now
and
then
joaquim
assisted
with
his
paddle
to
steady
the
boat
my
time
was
fully
occupied
in
bailing
out
the
water
and
watching
the
dogs
which
were
crowded
together
in
the
prow
yelling
with
fear
one
or
other
of
them
occasionally
falling
over
the
side
and
causing
great
commotion
in
scrambling
in
again
off
the
point
was
a
ridge
of
rocks
over
which
the
surge
raged
furiously
raimundo
sat
at
the
stern
rigid
and
silent
his
eye
steadily
watching
the
prow
of
the
boat
it
was
almost
worth
the
risk
and
discomfort
of
the
passage
to
witness
the
seamanlike
ability
displayed
by
indians
on
the
water
the
little
boat
rode
beautifully
rising
well
with
each
wave
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
we
arrived
at
caripi
thoroughly
tired
and
wet
through
to
the
skin
on
the
of
january
the
dry
season
came
abruptly
to
an
end
the
which
had
been
increasing
in
force
for
some
days
suddenly
ceased
and
the
atmosphere
became
misty
at
length
heavy
clouds
collected
where
a
uniform
blue
sky
had
for
many
weeks
prevailed
and
down
came
a
succession
of
heavy
showers
the
first
of
which
lasted
a
whole
day
and
night
this
seemed
to
give
a
new
stimulus
to
animal
life
on
the
first
night
there
was
a
tremendous
uproar
crickets
and
owls
all
joining
to
perform
a
deafening
concert
one
kind
of
sucker
kept
repeating
at
intervals
throughout
the
night
a
phrase
similar
to
the
portuguese
words
joao
corta
pao
john
cut
wood
a
phrase
which
forms
the
brazilian
name
of
the
bird
an
owl
in
one
of
the
genipapa
trees
muttered
now
and
then
a
succession
of
syllables
resembling
the
word
murucututu
sometimes
the
croaking
and
hooting
of
frogs
and
toads
were
so
loud
that
we
could
not
hear
one
another
voices
within
doors
swarms
of
dragonflies
appeared
in
the
daytime
about
the
pools
of
water
created
by
the
rain
and
ants
and
termites
came
forth
in
the
winged
state
in
vast
numbers
i
noticed
that
the
winged
termites
or
white
ants
which
came
by
hundreds
to
the
lamps
at
night
when
alighting
on
the
table
often
jerked
off
their
wings
by
a
voluntary
movement
on
examination
i
found
that
the
wings
were
not
shed
by
the
roots
for
a
small
portion
of
the
stumps
remained
attached
to
the
thorax
the
edge
of
the
fracture
was
in
all
cases
straight
not
ruptured
there
is
in
fact
a
natural
seam
crossing
the
member
towards
its
root
and
at
this
point
the
long
wing
naturally
drops
or
is
jerked
off
when
the
insect
has
no
further
use
for
it
the
white
ant
is
endowed
with
wings
simply
for
the
purpose
of
flying
away
from
the
colony
peopled
by
its
wingless
companions
to
pair
with
individuals
of
the
same
or
other
colonies
and
thus
propagate
and
disseminate
its
kind
the
winged
individuals
are
males
and
females
while
the
great
bulk
of
their
wingless
fraternity
are
of
no
sex
but
are
of
two
castes
soldiers
and
workers
which
are
restricted
to
the
functions
of
building
the
nests
nursing
and
defending
the
young
brood
the
two
sexes
mate
while
on
the
ground
after
the
wings
are
shed
and
then
the
married
couples
if
they
escape
the
numerous
enemies
which
lie
in
wait
for
them
proceed
to
the
task
of
founding
new
colonies
ants
and
white
ants
have
much
that
is
analogous
in
their
modes
of
life
they
belong
however
to
two
widely
different
orders
of
insects
strongly
contrasted
in
their
structure
and
manner
of
growth
i
amassed
at
caripi
a
very
large
collection
of
beautiful
and
curious
insects
amounting
altogether
to
about
twelve
hundred
species
the
number
of
coleoptera
was
remarkable
seeing
that
this
order
is
so
poorly
represented
near
para
i
attributed
their
abundance
to
the
number
of
new
clearings
made
in
the
virgin
forest
by
the
native
settlers
the
felled
timber
attracts
lignivorous
insects
and
these
draw
in
their
train
the
predaceous
species
of
various
families
as
a
general
rule
the
species
were
smaller
and
much
less
brilliant
in
colours
than
those
of
mexico
and
south
brazil
the
species
too
although
numerous
were
not
represented
by
great
numbers
of
individuals
they
were
also
extremely
nimble
and
therefore
much
less
easy
of
capture
than
insects
of
the
same
order
in
temperate
climates
the
carnivorous
beetles
at
caripi
were
like
those
of
para
chiefly
arboreal
most
of
them
exhibited
a
beautiful
contrivance
for
enabling
them
to
cling
to
and
run
over
smooth
or
flexible
surfaces
such
as
leaves
their
tarsi
or
feet
are
broad
and
furnished
beneath
with
a
brush
of
short
stiff
hairs
while
their
claws
are
toothed
in
the
form
of
a
comb
adapting
them
for
clinging
to
the
smooth
edges
of
leaves
the
joint
of
the
foot
which
precedes
the
claw
being
cleft
so
as
to
allow
free
play
to
the
claw
in
grasping
the
common
at
caripi
which
flew
about
in
the
evening
like
the
geotrupes
the
familiar
beetle
with
his
drowsy
hum
of
our
english
lanes
were
of
colossal
size
and
beautiful
colours
one
kind
had
a
long
horn
projecting
from
the
crown
of
its
head
phanaeus
lancifer
a
blow
from
this
fellow
as
he
came
heavily
flying
along
was
never
very
pleasant
all
the
tribes
of
beetles
which
feed
on
vegetable
substances
fresh
or
decayed
were
very
numerous
the
most
beautiful
of
these
but
not
the
most
common
were
the
longicornes
very
graceful
insects
having
slender
bodies
and
long
antennae
often
ornamented
with
fringes
and
tufts
of
hair
they
were
found
on
flowers
on
trunks
of
trees
or
flying
about
the
new
clearings
one
small
species
coremia
hirtipes
has
a
tuft
of
hairs
on
its
hind
legs
while
many
of
its
sister
species
have
a
similar
ornament
on
the
antennae
it
suggests
curious
reflections
when
we
see
an
ornament
like
the
feather
of
a
grenadier
cap
situated
on
one
part
of
the
body
in
one
species
and
in
a
totally
different
part
in
nearly
allied
ones
i
tried
in
vain
to
discover
the
use
of
these
curious
decorations
on
the
trunk
of
a
living
leguminous
tree
petzell
found
a
number
of
a
very
rare
and
handsome
species
the
platysternus
hebraeus
which
is
of
a
broad
shape
coloured
ochreous
but
spotted
and
striped
with
black
so
as
to
resemble
a
domino
on
the
felled
trunks
of
trees
swarms
of
longicornes
occurred
of
small
size
chrysoprasis
which
looked
like
miniature
beetles
and
indeed
are
closely
allied
to
those
european
insects
at
length
on
the
of
february
i
left
caripi
my
negro
and
indian
neighbours
bidding
me
a
warm
adios
i
had
passed
a
delightful
time
notwithstanding
the
many
privations
undergone
in
the
way
of
food
the
wet
season
had
now
set
in
the
lowlands
and
islands
would
soon
become
flooded
daily
at
high
water
and
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
fresh
provisions
would
increase
i
intended
therefore
to
spend
the
next
three
months
at
para
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
there
was
still
much
to
be
done
in
the
intervals
of
fine
weather
and
then
start
off
on
another
excursion
into
the
interior

at

of
my

voyage
up
the
amazons
namely
in
nearly
all
communication
with
the
interior
was
by
means
of
small
owned
by
traders
residing
in
the
remote
towns
and
villages
who
seldom
came
to
para
themselves
but
entrusted
vessels
and
cargoes
to
the
care
of
or
portuguese
cabos
sometimes
indeed
they
risked
all
in
the
hands
of
the
indian
crew
making
the
pilot
who
was
also
steersman
do
duty
as
supercargo
now
and
then
portuguese
and
brazilian
merchants
at
para
furnished
young
portuguese
with
merchandise
and
dispatched
them
to
the
interior
to
exchange
the
goods
for
produce
among
the
scattered
population
the
means
of
communication
in
fact
with
the
upper
parts
of
the
amazons
had
been
on
the
decline
for
some
time
on
account
of
the
augmented
difficulty
of
obtaining
hands
to
navigate
vessels
formerly
when
the
government
wished
to
send
any
important
functionary
such
as
a
judge
or
a
military
commandant
into
the
interior
they
equipped
a
galliota
manned
with
ten
or
a
dozen
indians
these
could
travel
on
the
average
in
one
day
farther
than
the
ordinary
sailing
craft
could
in
three
indian
paddlers
were
now
however
almost
impossible
to
be
obtained
and
government
officers
were
obliged
to
travel
as
passengers
in
the
voyage
made
in
this
way
was
tedious
in
the
extreme
when
the
regular
blew
the
vento
geral
or
of
the
amazons
vessels
could
get
along
very
well
but
when
this
failed
they
were
obliged
to
remain
sometimes
many
days
together
anchored
near
the
shore
or
progress
laboriously
by
means
of
the
espia
the
latter
mode
of
travelling
was
as
follows
the
montaria
with
twenty
or
thirty
fathoms
of
cable
one
end
of
which
was
attached
to
the
foremast
was
sent
ahead
with
a
couple
of
hands
who
secured
the
other
end
of
the
rope
to
some
strong
bough
or
trunk
the
crew
then
hauled
the
vessel
up
to
the
point
after
which
the
men
in
the
boat
the
cable
and
paddled
forwards
to
repeat
the
process
in
the
dry
season
from
august
to
december
when
the
is
strong
and
the
currents
slack
a
schooner
could
reach
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
a
thousand
miles
from
para
in
about
forty
days
but
in
the
wet
season
from
january
to
july
when
the
no
longer
blows
and
the
amazons
pours
forth
its
full
volume
of
water
flooding
the
banks
and
producing
a
tearing
current
it
took
three
months
to
travel
the
same
distance
it
was
a
great
blessing
to
the
inhabitants
when
in
a
line
of
steamers
was
established
and
this
same
journey
could
be
accomplished
with
ease
and
comfort
at
all
seasons
in
eight
days
it
is
perhaps
not
generally
known
that
the
portuguese
as
early
as
had
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
amazons
but
the
information
gathered
by
their
government
from
various
expeditions
undertaken
on
a
grand
scale
was
long
withheld
from
the
rest
of
the
world
through
the
jealous
policy
which
ruled
in
their
colonial
affairs
from
the
foundation
of
para
by
caldeira
in
to
the
settlement
of
the
boundary
line
between
the
spanish
and
portuguese
possessions
peru
and
brazil
in
numbers
of
these
expeditions
were
undertaken
in
succession
the
largest
was
the
one
commanded
by
pedro
texeira
in
who
ascended
the
river
to
quito
by
way
of
the
napo
a
distance
of
about
miles
with
canoes
and
men
and
returned
to
para
without
any
great
misadventure
by
the
same
route
the
success
of
this
remarkable
undertaking
amply
proved
at
that
early
date
the
facility
of
the
river
navigation
the
practicability
of
the
country
and
the
good
disposition
of
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
the
river
however
was
first
discovered
by
the
spaniards
the
mouth
having
been
visited
by
pinzon
in
and
nearly
the
whole
course
of
the
river
navigated
by
orellana
in
the
voyage
of
the
latter
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
on
record
orellana
was
a
lieutenant
of
gonzalo
pizarro
governor
of
quito
and
accompanied
the
latter
in
an
adventurous
journey
which
he
undertook
across
the
easternmost
chain
of
the
andes
down
into
the
sweltering
valley
of
the
napo
in
search
of
the
land
of
el
dorado
or
the
gilded
king
they
started
with
soldiers
and
indian
porters
but
arrived
on
the
banks
of
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
napo
their
followers
were
so
greatly
decreased
in
number
by
disease
and
hunger
and
the
remainder
so
much
weakened
that
pizarro
was
obliged
to
despatch
orellana
with
fifty
men
in
a
vessel
they
had
built
to
the
napo
in
search
of
provisions
it
can
be
imagined
by
those
acquainted
with
the
amazons
country
how
fruitless
this
errand
would
be
in
the
wilderness
of
forest
where
orellana
and
his
followers
found
themselves
when
they
reached
the
napo
and
how
strong
their
disinclination
would
be
to
return
against
the
currents
and
rapids
which
they
had
descended
the
idea
then
seized
them
to
commit
themselves
to
the
chances
of
the
stream
although
ignorant
whither
it
would
lead
so
onward
they
went
from
the
napo
they
emerged
into
the
main
amazons
and
after
many
and
various
adventures
with
the
indians
on
its
banks
reached
the
atlantic
eight
months
from
the
date
of
their
entering
the
great
river
it
was
during
this
voyage
that
the
nation
of
female
warriors
was
said
to
have
been
met
with
a
report
which
gave
rise
to
the
portuguese
name
of
the
river
amazonas
it
is
now
pretty
well
known
that
this
is
a
mere
fable
originating
in
the
love
of
the
marvellous
which
distinguished
the
early
spanish
adventurers
and
impaired
the
credibility
of
their
narratives
another
remarkable
voyage
was
accomplished
in
a
similar
manner
by
a
spaniard
named
lopez
from
cusco
in
peru
down
the
ucayali
a
branch
of
the
amazons
flowing
from
the
south
and
therefore
from
an
opposite
direction
to
that
of
the
napo
an
account
of
this
journey
was
sent
by
in
a
letter
to
the
king
of
spain
from
which
humboldt
has
given
an
extract
in
his
narrative
as
it
is
a
good
specimen
of
the
quaintness
of
style
and
looseness
of
statement
exhibited
by
these
early
narrators
of
adventures
in
south
america
i
will
give
a
translation
of
it
we
constructed
rafts
and
leaving
behind
our
horses
and
baggage
sailed
down
the
river
the
ucayali
with
great
risk
until
we
found
ourselves
in
a
gulf
of
fresh
water
in
this
river
maranon
we
continued
more
than
ten
months
and
a
half
down
to
its
mouth
where
it
falls
into
the
sea
we
made
one
hundred
journey
and
travelled
leagues
it
is
a
great
and
fearful
stream
has
leagues
of
fresh
water
at
its
mouth
vast
shoals
and
leagues
of
wilderness
without
any
kind
of
inhabitants
this
account
disagrees
with
that
of
acunna
the
historiographer
of
texeira
expedition
who
accompanied
him
in
on
his
return
voyage
from
quito
acunna
speaks
of
a
very
numerous
population
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
as
your
majesty
will
see
from
the
true
and
correct
narrative
of
the
journey
which
we
have
made
it
has
more
than
islands
god
knows
how
we
came
out
of
this
fearful
sea
many
expeditions
were
undertaken
in
the
course
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
fact
the
crossing
of
the
continent
from
the
pacific
to
the
atlantic
by
way
of
the
amazons
seems
to
have
become
by
this
time
a
common
occurrence
the
only
voyage
however
which
yielded
much
scientific
information
to
the
european
public
was
that
of
the
french
astronomer
la
condamine
in
the
most
complete
account
yet
published
of
the
river
is
that
given
by
von
martius
in
the
third
volume
of
spix
and
martius
travels
these
most
accomplished
travellers
were
eleven
months
in
the
country
namely
from
july
to
june
and
ascended
the
river
to
the
frontiers
of
the
brazilian
territory
the
accounts
they
have
given
of
the
geography
ethnology
botany
history
and
statistics
of
the
amazons
region
are
the
most
complete
that
have
ever
been
given
to
the
world
their
narrative
was
not
published
until
and
was
unfortunately
inaccessible
to
me
during
the
time
i
travelled
in
the
same
country
while
preparing
for
my
voyage
it
happened
fortunately
that
the
of
angelo
custodio
a
young
mestizo
named
joao
da
cunha
correia
was
about
to
start
for
the
amazons
on
a
trading
expedition
in
his
own
vessel
a
schooner
of
about
forty
burthen
a
passage
for
me
was
soon
arranged
with
him
through
the
intervention
of
angelo
and
we
started
on
the
of
september
i
intended
to
stop
at
some
village
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
lower
amazons
where
it
would
be
interesting
to
make
collections
in
order
to
show
the
relations
of
the
fauna
to
those
of
para
and
the
coast
region
of
guiana
as
i
should
have
to
hire
a
house
or
hut
wherever
i
stayed
i
took
all
the
materials
for
housekeeping
cooking
utensils
crockery
and
so
forth
to
these
were
added
a
stock
of
such
provisions
as
it
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
in
the
interior
also
ammunition
chests
a
small
library
of
natural
history
books
and
a
hundredweight
of
copper
money
i
engaged
after
some
trouble
a
mameluco
youth
to
accompany
me
as
servant
a
short
fat
boy
named
luco
whom
i
had
already
employed
at
para
in
collecting
we
weighed
anchor
at
night
and
on
the
following
day
found
ourselves
gliding
along
the
waters
of
the
moju
joao
da
cunha
like
most
of
his
fellow
countrymen
took
matters
very
easily
he
was
going
to
be
absent
in
the
interior
several
years
and
therefore
intended
to
diverge
from
his
route
to
visit
his
native
place
cameta
and
spend
a
few
days
with
his
friends
it
seemed
not
to
matter
to
him
that
he
had
a
cargo
of
merchandise
vessel
and
crew
of
twelve
persons
which
required
an
economical
use
of
time
pleasure
first
and
business
afterwards
appeared
to
be
his
maxim
we
stayed
at
cameta
twelve
days
the
chief
motive
for
prolonging
the
stay
to
this
extent
was
a
festival
at
the
aldeia
two
miles
below
cameta
which
was
to
commence
on
the
and
which
my
friend
wished
to
take
part
in
on
the
day
of
the
festival
the
schooner
was
sent
down
to
anchor
off
the
aldeia
and
master
and
men
gave
themselves
up
to
revelry
in
the
evening
a
strong
breeze
sprang
up
and
orders
were
given
to
embark
we
scrambled
down
in
the
dark
through
the
thickets
of
cacao
orange
and
coffee
trees
which
clothed
the
high
bank
and
after
running
great
risk
of
being
swamped
by
the
heavy
sea
in
the
crowded
montaria
got
all
aboard
by
nine
we
made
all
sail
amidst
the
adios
shouted
to
us
by
indian
and
mulatto
sweethearts
from
the
top
of
the
bank
and
tide
and
wind
being
favourable
were
soon
miles
away
our
crew
consisted
as
already
mentioned
of
twelve
persons
one
was
a
young
portuguese
from
the
province
of
traz
os
montes
a
pretty
sample
of
the
kind
of
emigrants
which
portugal
sends
to
brazil
he
was
two
or
three
and
twenty
years
of
age
and
had
been
about
two
years
in
the
country
dressing
and
living
like
the
indians
to
whom
he
was
certainly
inferior
in
manners
he
could
not
read
or
write
whereas
one
at
least
of
our
tapuyos
had
both
accomplishments
he
had
a
little
wooden
image
of
nossa
senora
in
his
rough
wooden
and
to
this
he
always
had
recourse
when
any
squall
arose
or
when
we
ran
aground
on
a
shoal
another
of
our
sailors
was
a
tawny
white
of
cameta
the
rest
were
indians
except
the
cook
who
was
a
cafuzo
or
breed
between
the
indian
and
negro
it
is
often
said
that
this
class
of
mestizos
is
the
most
of
all
the
numerous
crosses
between
the
races
inhabiting
brazil
but
luiz
was
a
simple
fellow
always
ready
to
do
one
a
service
the
pilot
was
an
old
tapuyo
of
para
with
regular
oval
face
and
features
i
was
astonished
at
his
endurance
he
never
quitted
the
helm
night
or
day
except
for
two
or
three
hours
in
the
morning
the
other
indians
used
to
bring
him
his
coffee
and
meals
and
after
breakfast
one
of
them
relieved
him
for
a
time
when
he
used
to
lie
down
on
the
quarterdeck
and
get
his
two
hours
nap
the
indians
forward
had
things
pretty
much
their
own
way
no
system
of
watches
was
followed
when
any
one
was
so
disposed
he
lay
down
on
the
deck
and
went
to
sleep
but
a
feeling
of
good
fellowship
seemed
always
to
exist
amongst
them
one
of
them
was
a
fine
specimen
of
the
indian
race
a
man
just
short
of
six
feet
high
with
remarkable
breadth
of
shoulder
and
full
muscular
chest
his
comrades
called
him
the
commandant
on
account
of
his
having
been
one
of
the
rebel
leaders
when
the
indians
and
others
took
santarem
in
they
related
of
him
that
when
the
legal
authorities
arrived
with
an
armed
flotilla
to
recapture
the
town
he
was
one
of
the
last
to
quit
remaining
in
the
little
fortress
which
commands
the
place
to
make
a
show
of
loading
the
guns
although
the
ammunition
had
given
out
long
ago
such
were
our
travelling
companions
we
lived
almost
the
same
as
on
board
ship
our
meals
were
cooked
in
the
galley
but
where
practicable
and
during
our
numerous
stoppages
the
men
went
in
the
montaria
to
fish
near
the
shore
so
that
our
breakfasts
and
dinners
of
salt
pirarucu
were
sometimes
varied
with
fresh
food
september
we
passed
with
the
morning
tide
yesterday
and
then
made
across
to
the
eastern
shore
the
for
all
canoes
which
have
to
traverse
the
broad
mouth
of
the
tocantins
going
west
early
this
morning
we
commenced
the
passage
the
navigation
is
attended
with
danger
on
account
of
the
extensive
shoals
in
the
middle
of
the
river
which
are
covered
only
by
a
small
depth
of
water
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
wind
was
fresh
and
the
schooner
rolled
and
pitched
like
a
ship
at
sea
the
distance
was
about
fifteen
miles
in
the
middle
the
was
very
imposing
towards
the
northeast
there
was
a
long
sweep
of
horizon
clear
of
land
and
on
the
southwest
stretched
a
similar
boundless
expanse
but
varied
with
islets
clothed
with
palms
which
however
were
visible
only
as
isolated
groups
of
columns
tufted
at
the
top
rising
here
and
there
amidst
the
waste
of
waters
in
the
afternoon
we
rounded
the
westernmost
point
the
land
which
is
not
terra
firma
but
simply
a
group
of
large
islands
forming
a
portion
of
the
tocantins
delta
was
then
about
three
miles
distant
on
the
following
day
we
sailed
towards
the
west
along
the
upper
portion
of
the
para
estuary
which
extends
seventy
miles
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
tocantins
it
varies
in
width
from
three
to
five
miles
but
broadens
rapidly
near
its
termination
where
it
is
eight
or
nine
miles
wide
the
northern
shore
is
formed
by
the
island
of
marajo
and
is
slightly
elevated
and
rocky
in
some
parts
a
series
of
islands
conceals
the
southern
shore
from
view
most
of
the
way
the
whole
country
mainland
and
islands
is
covered
with
forest
we
had
a
good
wind
all
day
and
about
entered
the
narrow
river
of
breves
which
commences
abruptly
the
extensive
labyrinth
of
channels
that
connects
the
para
with
the
amazons
the
sudden
termination
of
the
para
at
a
point
where
it
expands
to
so
great
a
breadth
is
remarkable
the
water
however
is
very
shallow
over
the
greater
portion
of
the
expanse
i
noticed
both
on
this
and
on
the
three
subsequent
occasions
of
passing
this
place
in
ascending
and
descending
the
river
that
the
flow
of
the
tide
from
the
east
along
the
estuary
as
well
as
up
the
breves
was
very
strong
this
seems
sufficient
to
prove
that
no
considerable
volume
of
water
passes
by
this
medium
from
the
amazons
to
the
para
and
that
the
opinion
of
those
geographers
is
an
incorrect
one
who
believe
the
para
to
be
one
of
the
mouths
of
the
great
river
there
is
however
another
channel
connecting
the
two
rivers
which
enters
the
para
six
miles
to
the
south
of
the
breves
the
lower
part
of
its
course
for
eighteen
miles
is
formed
by
the
uanapu
a
large
and
independent
river
flowing
from
the
south
the
tidal
flow
is
said
by
the
natives
to
produce
little
or
no
current
up
this
river
a
fact
which
seems
to
afford
a
little
support
to
the
view
just
stated
we
passed
the
village
of
breves
at
on
the
it
consists
of
about
forty
houses
most
of
which
are
occupied
by
portuguese
shopkeepers
a
few
indian
families
reside
here
who
occupy
themselves
with
the
manufacture
of
ornamental
pottery
and
painted
cuyas
which
they
sell
to
traders
or
passing
travellers
the
cuyas
made
from
gourds
are
sometimes
very
tastefully
painted
the
rich
black
ground
colour
is
produced
by
a
dye
made
from
the
bark
of
a
tree
called
comateu
the
gummy
nature
of
which
imparts
a
fine
polish
the
yellow
tints
are
made
with
the
tabatinga
clay
the
red
with
the
seeds
of
the
urucu
or
anatto
plant
and
the
blue
with
indigo
which
is
planted
round
the
huts
the
art
is
indigenous
with
the
amazonian
indians
but
it
is
only
the
settled
agricultural
tribes
belonging
to
the
tupi
stock
who
practise
it
september
after
passing
breves
we
continued
our
way
slowly
along
a
channel
or
series
of
channels
of
variable
width
on
the
morning
of
the
we
had
a
fair
wind
the
breadth
of
the
stream
varying
from
about
to
yards
about
midday
we
passed
on
the
western
side
the
mouth
of
the
aturiazal
through
which
on
account
of
its
swifter
current
vessels
pass
in
descending
from
the
amazons
to
para
shortly
afterwards
we
entered
the
narrow
channel
of
the
jaburu
which
lies
twenty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
breves
here
commences
the
peculiar
scenery
of
this
remarkable
region
we
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
and
nearly
straight
canal
not
more
than
eighty
to
a
hundred
yards
in
width
and
hemmed
in
by
two
walls
of
forest
which
rose
quite
perpendicularly
from
the
water
to
a
height
of
seventy
or
eighty
feet
the
water
was
of
great
and
uniform
depth
even
close
to
the
banks
we
seemed
to
be
in
a
deep
gorge
and
the
strange
impression
the
place
produced
was
augmented
by
the
dull
echoes
wakened
by
the
voices
of
our
indians
and
the
splash
of
their
paddles
the
forest
was
excessively
varied
some
of
the
trees
the
giants
of
the
leguminous
and
bombaceous
orders
reared
their
heads
far
above
the
average
height
of
the
green
walls
the
miriti
palm
was
scattered
in
some
numbers
amidst
the
rest
a
few
solitary
specimens
shooting
up
their
smooth
columns
above
the
other
trees
the
graceful
assai
palm
grew
in
little
groups
forming
feathery
pictures
set
in
the
rounder
foliage
of
the
mass
the
ubussu
lower
in
height
showed
only
its
shuttlecock
shaped
crowns
of
huge
undivided
fronds
which
being
of
a
vivid
contrasted
forcibly
against
the
sombre
hues
of
the
surrounding
foliage
the
ubussu
grew
here
in
great
numbers
the
equally
remarkable
jupati
palm
rhaphia
taedigera
which
like
the
ubussu
is
peculiar
to
this
district
occurred
more
sparsely
throwing
its
long
shaggy
leaves
forty
to
fifty
feet
in
length
in
broad
arches
over
the
canal
an
infinite
diversity
of
palms
decorated
the
water
edge
such
as
the
bactris
many
species
the
ubim
geonoma
and
a
few
stately
bacabas
oenocarpus
bacaba
the
shape
of
this
last
is
exceedingly
elegant
the
size
of
the
crown
being
in
proper
proportion
to
the
straight
smooth
stem
the
leaves
down
even
to
the
bases
of
the
glossy
petioles
are
of
a
rich
colour
and
free
from
spines
the
forest
wall
i
am
extracting
from
my
under
which
we
are
now
moving
consists
besides
palms
of
a
great
variety
of
ordinary
forest
trees
from
the
highest
branches
of
these
down
to
the
water
sweep
ribbons
of
climbing
plants
of
the
most
diverse
and
ornamental
foliage
possible
creeping
convolvuli
and
others
have
made
use
of
the
slender
lianas
and
hanging
air
roots
as
ladders
to
climb
by
now
and
then
appears
a
mimosa
or
other
tree
having
similar
fine
pinnate
foliage
and
thick
masses
of
inga
border
the
water
from
whose
branches
hang
long
of
different
shape
and
size
according
to
the
species
some
of
them
a
yard
in
length
flowers
there
are
very
few
i
see
now
and
then
a
gorgeous
crimson
blossom
on
long
spikes
ornamenting
the
sombre
foliage
towards
the
summits
of
the
forest
i
suppose
it
to
belong
to
a
climber
of
the
combretaceous
order
there
are
also
a
few
yellow
and
violet
bignoniae
the
blossoms
of
the
ingas
although
not
conspicuous
are
delicately
beautiful
the
forest
all
along
offers
so
dense
a
front
that
one
never
obtains
a
glimpse
into
the
interior
of
the
wilderness
the
length
of
the
jaburu
channel
is
about
miles
allowing
for
the
numerous
abrupt
bends
which
occur
between
the
middle
and
the
northern
end
of
its
course
we
were
three
days
and
a
half
accomplishing
the
passage
the
banks
on
each
side
seemed
to
be
composed
of
hard
with
a
thick
covering
of
vegetable
mold
so
that
i
should
imagine
this
whole
district
originated
in
a
gradual
accumulation
of
alluvium
through
which
the
endless
labyrinths
of
channels
have
worked
their
deep
and
narrow
beds
the
as
we
travelled
northward
became
gradually
of
less
assistance
to
us
as
it
caused
only
a
feeble
current
upwards
the
pressure
of
the
waters
from
the
amazons
here
makes
itself
felt
as
this
is
not
the
case
lower
down
i
suppose
the
currents
are
diverted
through
some
of
the
numerous
channels
which
we
passed
on
our
right
and
which
traverse
in
their
course
towards
the
sea
the
northwestern
part
of
marajo
in
the
evening
of
the
we
arrived
at
a
point
where
another
channel
joins
the
jaburu
from
the
northeast
up
this
the
tide
was
flowing
we
turned
westward
and
thus
met
the
flood
coming
from
the
amazons
this
point
is
the
object
of
a
strange
superstitious
observance
on
the
part
of
the
canoemen
it
is
said
to
be
haunted
by
a
paje
or
indian
wizard
whom
it
is
necessary
to
propitiate
by
depositing
some
article
on
the
spot
if
the
voyager
wishes
to
secure
a
safe
return
from
the
sertao
as
the
interior
of
the
country
is
called
the
trees
were
all
hung
with
rags
shirts
straw
hats
bunches
of
fruit
and
so
forth
although
the
superstition
doubtless
originated
with
the
aborigines
i
observed
in
both
my
voyages
that
it
was
only
the
portuguese
and
uneducated
brazilians
who
deposited
anything
the
pure
indians
gave
nothing
and
treated
the
whole
affair
as
a
humbug
but
they
were
all
civilised
tapuyos
on
the
at
we
reached
a
broad
channel
called
macaco
and
now
left
the
dark
echoing
jaburu
the
macaco
sends
off
branches
towards
the
northwest
coast
of
marajo
it
is
merely
a
passage
amongst
a
cluster
of
islands
between
which
a
glimpse
is
occasionally
obtained
of
the
broad
waters
of
the
main
amazons
a
brisk
wind
carried
us
rapidly
past
its
monotonous
scenery
and
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
october
we
reached
the
entrance
of
the
uituquara
or
the
which
is
fifteen
miles
distant
from
the
end
of
the
jaburu
this
is
also
a
winding
channel
miles
in
length
threading
a
group
of
islands
but
it
is
much
narrower
than
the
macaco
on
emerging
from
the
uituquara
on
the
we
all
went
ashore
the
men
to
fish
in
a
small
creek
joao
da
cunha
and
i
to
shoot
birds
we
saw
a
flock
of
scarlet
and
blue
macaws
macrocercus
macao
feeding
on
the
fruits
of
a
bacaba
palm
and
looking
like
a
cluster
of
flaunting
banners
beneath
its
crown
we
landed
about
fifty
yards
from
the
place
and
crept
cautiously
through
the
forest
but
before
we
reached
them
they
flew
off
with
loud
harsh
screams
at
a
wild
fruit
tree
we
were
more
successful
as
my
companion
shot
an
anaca
derotypus
coronatus
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
parrot
family
it
is
of
a
green
colour
and
has
a
hood
of
feathers
red
bordered
with
blue
at
the
back
of
its
head
which
it
can
elevate
or
depress
at
pleasure
the
anaca
is
the
only
parrot
which
nearly
resembles
the
cockatoo
of
australia
it
is
found
in
all
the
lowlands
throughout
the
amazons
region
but
is
not
a
common
bird
anywhere
few
persons
succeed
in
taming
it
and
i
never
saw
one
that
had
been
taught
to
speak
the
natives
are
very
fond
of
the
bird
nevertheless
and
keep
it
in
their
houses
for
the
sake
of
seeing
the
irascible
creature
expand
its
beautiful
frill
of
feathers
which
it
readily
does
when
excited
the
men
returned
with
a
large
quantity
of
fish
i
was
surprised
at
the
great
variety
of
species
the
prevailing
kind
was
a
species
of
loricaria
a
foot
in
length
and
wholly
encased
in
bony
armour
it
abounds
at
certain
seasons
in
shallow
water
the
flesh
is
dry
but
very
palatable
they
brought
also
a
small
alligator
which
they
called
jacare
curua
and
said
it
was
a
kind
found
only
in
shallow
creeks
it
was
not
more
than
two
feet
in
length
although
according
to
the
statement
of
the
indians
who
said
it
was
a
mai
or
mother
of
eggs
as
they
had
pillaged
the
nest
which
they
had
found
near
the
edge
of
the
water
the
eggs
were
rather
larger
than
a
hen
and
regularly
oval
in
shape
presenting
a
rough
hard
surface
of
shell
unfortunately
the
alligator
was
cut
up
ready
for
cooking
when
we
returned
to
the
schooner
and
i
could
not
therefore
make
a
note
of
its
peculiarities
the
pieces
were
skewered
and
roasted
over
the
fire
each
man
being
his
own
cook
i
never
saw
this
species
of
alligator
afterwards
october
about
midnight
the
wind
for
which
we
had
long
been
waiting
sprang
up
the
men
weighed
anchor
and
we
were
soon
fairly
embarked
on
the
amazons
i
rose
long
before
sunrise
to
see
the
great
river
by
moonlight
there
was
a
spanking
breeze
and
the
vessel
was
bounding
gaily
over
the
waters
the
channel
along
which
we
were
sailing
was
only
a
narrow
arm
of
the
river
about
two
miles
in
width
the
total
breadth
at
this
point
is
more
than
twenty
miles
but
the
stream
is
divided
into
three
parts
by
a
series
of
large
islands
the
river
notwithstanding
this
limitation
of
its
breadth
had
a
most
majestic
appearance
it
did
not
present
that
aspect
which
the
waters
of
the
para
and
tocantins
affect
but
had
all
the
swing
so
to
speak
of
a
vast
flowing
stream
the
turbid
waters
offered
also
a
great
contrast
to
the
rivers
belonging
to
the
para
system
the
channel
formed
a
splendid
reach
sweeping
from
southwest
to
northeast
with
a
horizon
of
water
and
sky
both
upstream
and
down
at
we
arrived
at
gurupa
a
small
village
situated
on
a
rocky
bank
thirty
or
forty
feet
high
here
we
landed
and
i
had
an
opportunity
of
rambling
in
the
neighbouring
woods
which
are
intersected
by
numerous
pathways
and
carpeted
with
lycopodia
growing
to
a
height
of
eight
or
ten
inches
and
enlivened
by
numbers
of
glossy
blue
butterflies
of
the
theclidae
or
hairstreak
family
at
we
were
again
under
way
soon
after
sunset
as
we
were
crossing
the
mouth
of
the
xingu
the
first
of
the
great
tributaries
of
the
amazons
miles
in
length
a
black
cloud
arose
suddenly
in
the
northeast
joao
da
cunha
ordered
all
sails
to
be
taken
in
and
immediately
afterwards
a
furious
squall
burst
forth
tearing
the
waters
into
foam
and
producing
a
frightful
uproar
in
the
neighbouring
forests
a
drenching
rain
followed
but
in
half
an
hour
all
was
again
calm
and
the
full
moon
appeared
sailing
in
a
cloudless
sky
from
the
mouth
of
the
xingu
the
route
followed
by
vessels
leads
straight
across
the
river
here
ten
miles
broad
towards
midnight
the
wind
failed
us
when
we
were
close
to
a
large
shoal
called
the
baixo
grande
we
lay
here
becalmed
in
the
sickening
heat
for
two
days
and
when
the
recommenced
with
the
rising
moon
at
on
the
we
found
ourselves
on
a
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
our
pilot
to
avoid
it
we
ran
aground
fortunately
the
bottom
consisted
only
of
soft
mud
so
that
by
casting
anchor
to
windward
and
hauling
in
with
the
whole
strength
of
crew
and
passengers
we
got
off
after
spending
an
uncomfortable
night
we
rounded
the
point
of
the
shoal
in
two
fathoms
water
the
head
of
the
vessel
was
then
put
westward
and
by
sunrise
we
were
bounding
forward
before
a
steady
breeze
all
sail
set
and
everybody
in
good
humour
the
weather
was
now
delightful
for
several
days
in
succession
the
air
transparently
clear
and
the
breeze
cool
and
invigorating
at
daylight
on
the
a
chain
of
blue
hills
the
serra
de
almeyrim
appeared
in
the
distance
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
the
sight
was
most
exhilarating
after
so
long
a
sojourn
in
a
flat
country
we
kept
to
the
southern
shore
passing
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
mouths
of
the
urucuricaya
and
the
aquiqui
two
channels
which
communicate
with
the
xingu
the
whole
of
this
southern
coast
hence
to
near
santarem
a
distance
of
miles
is
lowland
and
quite
uninhabited
it
is
intersected
by
short
arms
or
back
waters
of
the
amazons
which
are
called
in
the
tupi
language
paranamirims
or
little
rivers
by
keeping
to
these
small
canoes
can
travel
a
great
part
of
the
distance
without
being
much
exposed
to
the
heavy
seas
of
the
main
river
the
coast
throughout
has
a
most
desolate
aspect
the
forest
is
not
so
varied
as
on
the
higher
land
and
the
which
is
destitute
of
the
green
mantle
of
climbing
plants
that
form
so
rich
a
decoration
in
other
parts
is
encumbered
at
every
step
with
piles
of
fallen
trees
and
peopled
by
white
egrets
ghostly
storks
and
solitary
herons
in
the
evening
we
passed
almeyrim
the
hills
according
to
von
martius
who
landed
here
are
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
and
are
thickly
wooded
to
the
summit
they
commence
on
the
east
by
a
few
low
isolated
and
rounded
elevations
but
towards
the
west
of
the
village
they
assume
the
appearance
of
elongated
ridges
which
seem
as
if
they
had
been
planed
down
to
a
uniform
height
by
some
external
force
the
next
day
we
passed
in
succession
a
series
of
similar
hills
some
isolated
and
of
a
shape
others
prolonged
to
a
length
of
several
miles
there
is
an
interval
of
low
country
between
these
and
the
almeyrim
range
which
has
a
total
length
of
about
miles
then
commences
abruptly
the
serra
de
marauaqua
which
is
succeeded
in
a
similar
way
by
the
velha
pobre
range
the
serras
de
and
all
these
form
a
striking
contrast
to
the
serra
de
almeyrim
in
being
quite
destitute
of
trees
they
have
steep
rugged
sides
apparently
clothed
with
short
herbage
but
here
and
there
exposing
bare
white
patches
their
total
length
is
about
forty
miles
in
the
tear
towards
the
interior
they
are
succeeded
by
other
ranges
of
hills
communicating
with
the
central
of
guiana
which
divides
brazil
from
cayenne
as
we
sailed
along
the
southern
shore
during
the
and
two
following
days
the
hills
on
the
opposite
side
occupied
most
of
our
attention
the
river
is
from
four
to
five
miles
broad
and
in
some
places
long
low
wooded
islands
intervene
in
whose
vivid
verdure
formed
a
strangely
beautiful
foreground
to
the
glorious
landscape
of
broad
stream
and
grey
mountain
ninety
miles
beyond
almeyrim
stands
the
village
of
monte
alegre
which
is
built
near
the
summit
of
the
last
hill
visible
of
this
chain
at
this
point
the
river
bends
a
little
towards
the
south
and
the
hilly
country
recedes
from
its
shores
to
reappear
at
obydos
greatly
decreased
in
height
about
a
hundred
miles
further
west
we
crossed
the
river
three
times
between
monte
alegre
and
the
next
town
santarem
in
the
middle
the
waves
ran
very
high
and
the
vessel
lurched
fearfully
hurling
everything
that
was
not
well
secured
from
one
side
of
the
deck
to
the
other
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
a
gentle
wind
carried
us
along
a
remanso
or
still
water
under
the
southern
shore
these
tracts
of
quiet
water
are
frequent
on
the
irregular
sides
of
the
stream
and
are
the
effect
of
counter
movements
caused
by
the
rapid
current
of
its
central
parts
at
we
passed
the
mouth
of
a
called
mahica
and
then
found
a
sudden
change
in
the
colour
of
the
water
and
aspect
of
the
banks
instead
of
the
low
and
swampy
which
had
prevailed
from
the
mouth
of
the
xingu
we
saw
before
us
a
broad
sloping
beach
of
white
sand
the
forest
instead
of
being
an
entangled
mass
of
irregular
and
rank
vegetation
as
hitherto
presented
a
rounded
outline
and
created
an
impresssion
of
repose
that
was
very
pleasing
we
now
approached
in
fact
the
mouth
of
the
tapajos
whose
clear
green
waters
here
replaced
the
muddy
current
against
which
we
had
so
long
been
sailing
although
this
is
a
river
of
great
extent
miles
in
length
and
for
the
last
eighty
miles
of
its
course
four
to
ten
in
breadth
its
contribution
to
the
amazons
is
not
perceptible
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
the
white
turbid
current
of
the
main
river
flows
disdainfully
by
occupying
nearly
the
whole
breadth
of
the
channel
while
the
darker
water
of
its
tributary
seems
to
creep
along
the
shore
and
is
no
longer
distinguishable
four
or
five
miles
from
its
mouth
we
reached
santarem
at
the
town
has
a
clean
and
cheerful
appearance
from
the
river
it
consists
of
three
long
streets
with
a
few
short
ones
crossing
them
at
right
angles
and
contains
about
inhabitants
it
lies
just
within
the
mouth
of
tapajos
and
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
town
and
the
aldeia
or
village
the
houses
of
the
white
and
trading
classes
are
substantially
built
many
being
of
two
and
three
stories
and
all
and
tiled
the
aldeia
which
contains
the
indian
portion
of
the
population
or
did
so
formerly
consists
mostly
of
mud
huts
thatched
with
palm
leaves
the
situation
of
the
town
is
very
beautiful
the
land
although
but
slightly
elevated
does
not
form
strictly
speaking
a
portion
of
the
alluvial
river
plains
of
the
amazons
but
is
rather
a
northern
prolongation
of
the
brazilian
continental
land
it
is
scantily
wooded
and
towards
the
interior
consists
of
undulating
campos
which
are
connected
with
a
series
of
hills
extending
southward
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
i
subsequently
made
this
place
my
quarters
for
three
years
an
account
of
its
neighbourhood
is
therefore
reserved
for
another
chapter
at
the
first
sight
of
santarem
one
can
not
help
being
struck
with
the
advantages
of
its
situation
although
miles
from
the
sea
it
is
accessible
to
vessels
of
heavy
tonnage
coming
straight
from
the
atlantic
the
river
has
only
two
slight
bends
between
this
port
and
the
sea
and
for
five
or
six
months
in
the
year
the
amazonian
trade
wind
blows
with
very
little
interruption
so
that
sailing
ships
coming
from
foreign
countries
could
reach
the
place
with
little
difficulty
we
ourselves
had
accomplished
miles
or
about
half
the
distance
from
the
sea
in
an
vessel
in
three
days
and
a
half
although
the
land
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
is
perhaps
ill
adapted
for
agriculture
an
immense
tract
of
rich
soil
with
forest
and
meadowland
lies
on
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
and
the
tapajos
leads
into
the
heart
of
the
mining
provinces
of
interior
brazil
but
where
is
the
population
to
come
from
to
develop
the
resources
of
this
fine
country
at
present
the
district
within
a
radius
of
miles
contains
barely
inhabitants
behind
the
town
towards
the
interior
the
country
is
uninhabited
and
jaguars
roam
nightly
at
least
in
the
rainy
season
close
up
to
the
ends
of
the
suburban
streets
from
information
obtained
here
i
fixed
upon
the
next
town
obydos
as
the
best
place
to
stay
for
a
few
weeks
in
order
to
investigate
the
natural
productions
of
the
north
side
of
the
lower
amazons
we
started
at
sunrise
on
the
and
being
still
favoured
by
wind
and
weather
made
a
pleasant
passage
reaching
obydos
which
is
nearly
fifty
miles
distant
from
santarem
by
midnight
we
sailed
all
day
close
to
the
southern
shore
and
found
the
banks
here
and
there
dotted
with
houses
of
settlers
each
surrounded
by
its
plantation
of
cacao
which
is
the
staple
product
of
the
district
this
coast
has
an
evil
reputation
for
storms
and
mosquitoes
but
we
fortunately
escaped
both
it
was
remarkable
that
we
had
been
troubled
by
mosquitoes
only
on
one
night
and
then
to
a
small
degree
during
the
whole
of
our
voyage
i
landed
at
obydos
the
next
morning
and
then
bid
adieu
to
my
kind
friend
joao
da
cunha
who
after
landing
my
baggage
got
up
his
anchor
and
continued
on
his
way
the
town
contains
about
inhabitants
and
is
airily
situated
on
a
high
bluff
ninety
or
a
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
the
coast
is
precipitous
for
two
or
three
miles
hence
to
the
west
the
cliffs
consist
of
the
clay
or
tabatinga
which
occurs
so
frequently
throughout
the
amazons
region
the
strong
current
of
the
river
sets
full
against
them
in
the
season
of
high
water
and
annually
carries
away
large
portions
the
clay
in
places
is
stratified
alternately
pink
and
yellow
the
pink
beds
being
the
thickest
and
of
much
harder
texture
than
the
others
when
i
descended
the
river
in
a
german
major
of
engineers
in
the
employ
of
the
government
told
me
that
he
had
found
calcareous
layers
thickly
studded
with
marine
shells
interstratified
with
the
clay
on
the
top
of
the
tabatinga
lies
a
bed
of
sand
in
some
places
several
feet
thick
and
the
whole
formation
rests
on
strata
of
sandstone
which
are
exposed
only
when
the
river
reaches
its
lowest
level
behind
the
town
rises
a
fine
rounded
hill
and
a
range
of
similar
elevations
extends
six
miles
westward
terminating
at
the
mouth
of
the
trombetas
a
large
river
flowing
through
the
interior
of
guiana
hills
and
lowlands
alike
are
covered
with
a
sombre
rolling
forest
the
river
here
is
contracted
to
a
breadth
of
rather
less
than
a
mile
yards
and
the
entire
volume
of
its
waters
the
collective
product
of
a
score
of
mighty
streams
is
poured
through
the
strait
with
tremendous
velocity
it
must
be
remarked
however
that
the
river
valley
itself
is
not
contracted
to
this
breadth
the
opposite
shore
not
being
continental
land
but
a
low
alluvial
tract
subject
to
inundation
more
or
less
in
the
rainy
season
behind
it
lies
an
extensive
lake
called
the
lago
grande
da
villa
franca
which
communicates
with
the
amazons
both
above
and
below
obydos
and
has
therefore
the
appearance
of
a
or
an
old
channel
of
the
river
this
lake
is
about
miles
in
length
and
from
four
to
ten
in
width
but
its
waters
are
of
little
depth
and
in
the
dry
season
its
dimensions
are
much
lessened
it
has
no
perceptible
current
and
does
not
therefore
now
divert
any
portion
of
the
waters
of
the
amazons
from
their
main
course
past
obydos
i
remained
at
obydos
from
the
of
october
to
the
of
november
i
spent
three
weeks
here
also
in
when
the
place
was
much
changed
through
the
influx
of
portuguese
immigrants
and
the
building
of
a
fortress
on
the
top
of
the
bluff
it
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
towns
on
the
river
the
houses
are
all
roofed
with
tiles
and
are
mostly
of
substantial
architecture
the
inhabitants
at
least
at
the
time
of
my
first
visit
were
naive
in
their
ways
kind
and
sociable
scarcely
any
huts
are
to
be
seen
for
very
few
indians
now
reside
here
it
was
one
of
the
early
settlements
of
the
portuguese
and
the
better
class
of
the
population
consists
of
white
families
who
exhibit
however
in
some
cases
traces
of
cross
with
the
indian
and
negro
obydos
and
santarem
have
received
during
the
last
eighty
years
considerable
importations
of
negro
slaves
before
that
time
a
cruel
traffic
was
carried
on
in
indians
for
the
same
purpose
of
forced
servitude
but
their
numbers
have
gradually
dwindled
away
and
indians
now
form
an
insignificant
element
in
the
population
of
the
district
most
of
the
obydos
townsfolk
are
owners
of
cacao
plantations
which
are
situated
on
the
low
lands
in
the
vicinity
some
are
large
cattle
proprietors
and
possess
estates
of
many
square
leagues
extent
in
the
campo
or
districts
which
border
the
lago
grande
and
other
similar
inland
lakes
near
the
villages
of
faro
and
alemquer
these
campos
bear
a
crop
of
nutritious
grass
but
in
certain
seasons
when
the
rising
of
the
amazons
exceeds
the
average
they
are
apt
to
be
flooded
and
then
the
large
herds
of
half
wild
cattle
suffer
great
mortality
from
drowning
hunger
and
alligators
neither
in
nor
are
any
but
the
laziest
and
most
primitive
methods
followed
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
proprietors
are
generally
poor
a
few
however
have
become
rich
by
applying
a
moderate
amount
of
industry
and
skill
to
the
management
of
their
estates
people
spoke
of
several
heiresses
in
the
neighbourhood
whose
wealth
was
reckoned
in
oxen
and
slaves
a
dozen
slaves
and
a
few
hundred
head
of
cattle
being
considered
a
great
fortune
some
of
them
i
saw
had
already
been
appropriated
by
enterprising
young
men
who
had
come
from
para
and
maranham
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
this
quarter
the
few
weeks
i
spent
here
passed
away
pleasantly
i
generally
spent
the
evenings
in
the
society
of
the
townspeople
who
associated
together
contrary
to
brazilian
custom
in
european
fashion
the
different
families
meeting
at
one
another
houses
for
social
amusement
bachelor
friends
not
being
excluded
and
the
whole
company
married
and
single
joining
in
simple
games
the
meetings
used
to
take
place
in
the
and
not
in
the
open
verandas
a
fashion
almost
compulsory
on
account
of
the
mosquitoes
but
the
evenings
here
are
very
cool
and
the
closeness
of
a
room
is
not
so
much
felt
as
it
is
in
para
sunday
was
strictly
observed
at
obydos
at
least
all
the
shops
were
closed
and
almost
the
whole
population
went
to
church
the
vicar
padre
raimundo
do
sanchez
brito
was
an
excellent
old
man
and
i
fancy
the
friendly
manners
of
the
people
and
the
general
purity
of
morals
at
obydos
were
owing
in
great
part
to
the
good
example
he
set
to
his
parishioners
the
forest
at
obydos
seemed
to
abound
in
monkeys
for
i
rarely
passed
a
day
without
seeing
several
i
noticed
four
species
the
coaita
ateles
paniscus
the
chrysothrix
sciureus
the
callithrix
torquatus
and
our
old
para
friend
midas
ursulus
the
coaita
is
a
large
black
monkey
covered
with
coarse
hair
and
having
the
prominent
parts
of
the
face
of
a
tawny
hue
it
is
the
largest
of
the
amazonian
monkeys
in
stature
but
is
excelled
in
bulk
by
the
barrigudo
lagothrix
humboldtii
of
the
upper
amazons
it
occurs
throughout
the
lowlands
of
the
lower
and
upper
amazons
but
does
not
range
to
the
south
beyond
the
limits
of
the
river
plains
at
that
point
an
allied
species
the
coaita
ateles
marginatus
takes
its
place
the
coaitas
are
called
by
zoologists
spider
monkeys
on
account
of
the
length
and
slenderness
of
their
body
and
limbs
in
these
apes
the
tail
as
a
prehensile
organ
reaches
its
highest
degree
of
perfection
and
on
this
account
it
would
perhaps
be
correct
to
consider
the
coaitas
as
the
extreme
development
of
the
american
type
of
apes
as
far
as
we
know
from
living
and
fossil
species
the
new
world
has
progressed
no
farther
than
the
coaita
towards
the
production
of
a
higher
form
of
the
quadrumanous
order
the
tendency
of
nature
here
has
been
to
all
appearance
simply
to
perfect
those
organs
which
adapt
the
species
more
and
more
completely
to
a
purely
arboreal
life
and
no
nearer
approach
has
been
made
towards
the
more
advanced
forms
of
anthropoid
apes
which
are
the
products
of
the
old
world
solely
the
flesh
of
this
monkey
is
much
esteemed
by
the
natives
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
the
military
commandant
of
obydos
major
gama
every
week
sent
a
negro
hunter
to
shoot
one
for
his
table
one
day
i
went
on
a
coaita
hunt
borrowing
a
negro
slave
of
a
friend
to
show
me
the
way
when
in
the
deepest
part
of
a
ravine
we
heard
a
rustling
sound
in
the
trees
overheard
and
manoel
soon
pointed
out
a
coaita
to
me
there
was
something
in
its
appearance
as
the
lean
dark
shaggy
creature
moved
deliberately
amongst
the
branches
at
a
great
height
i
fired
but
unfortunately
only
wounded
it
in
the
belly
it
fell
with
a
crash
headlong
about
twenty
or
thirty
feet
and
then
caught
a
bough
with
its
tail
which
grasped
it
instantaneously
and
then
the
animal
remained
suspended
in
before
i
could
reload
it
recovered
itself
and
mounted
nimbly
to
the
topmost
branches
out
of
the
reach
of
a
where
we
could
perceive
the
poor
thing
apparently
probing
the
wound
with
its
fingers
coaitas
are
more
frequently
kept
in
a
tame
state
than
any
other
kind
of
monkey
the
indians
are
very
fond
of
them
as
pets
and
the
women
often
suckle
them
when
young
at
their
breasts
they
become
attached
to
their
masters
and
will
sometimes
follow
them
on
the
ground
to
considerable
distances
i
once
saw
a
most
ridiculously
tame
coaita
it
was
an
old
female
which
accompanied
its
owner
a
trader
on
the
river
in
all
his
voyages
by
way
of
giving
me
a
specimen
of
its
intelligence
and
feeling
its
master
set
to
and
rated
it
soundly
calling
it
scamp
heathen
thief
and
so
forth
all
through
the
copious
portuguese
vocabulary
of
vituperation
the
poor
monkey
quietly
seated
on
the
ground
seemed
to
be
in
sore
trouble
at
this
display
of
anger
it
began
by
looking
earnestly
at
him
then
it
whined
and
lastly
rocked
its
body
to
and
fro
with
emotion
crying
piteously
and
passing
its
long
gaunt
arms
continually
over
its
forehead
for
this
was
its
habit
when
excited
and
the
front
of
the
head
was
worn
quite
bald
in
consequence
at
length
its
master
altered
his
tone
all
a
lie
my
old
woman
you
an
angel
a
flower
a
good
affectionate
old
creature
and
so
forth
immediately
the
poor
monkey
ceased
its
wailing
and
soon
after
came
over
to
where
the
man
sat
the
disposition
of
the
coaita
is
mild
in
the
extreme
it
has
none
of
the
painful
restless
vivacity
of
its
kindred
the
cebi
and
no
trace
of
the
surly
untameable
temper
of
its
still
nearer
relatives
the
mycetes
or
howling
monkeys
it
is
however
an
arrant
thief
and
shows
considerable
cunning
in
pilfering
small
articles
of
clothing
which
it
conceals
in
its
sleeping
place
the
natives
of
the
upper
amazons
procure
the
coaita
when
full
grown
by
shooting
it
with
the
blowpipe
and
poisoned
darts
and
restoring
life
by
putting
a
little
salt
the
antidote
to
the
urari
poison
with
which
the
darts
are
tipped
in
its
mouth
the
animals
thus
caught
become
tame
forthwith
two
females
were
once
kept
at
the
jardin
des
plantes
of
paris
and
geoffroy
hilaire
relates
of
them
that
they
rarely
quitted
each
other
remaining
most
of
the
time
in
close
embrace
folding
their
tails
around
one
another
bodies
they
took
their
meals
together
and
it
was
remarked
on
such
occasions
when
the
friendship
of
animals
is
put
to
a
hard
test
that
they
never
quarrelled
or
disputed
the
possession
of
a
favourite
fruit
with
each
other
the
neighbourhood
of
obydos
was
rich
also
in
insects
in
the
broad
alleys
of
the
forest
a
magnificent
butterfly
of
the
genus
morpho
six
to
eight
inches
in
expanse
the
morpho
hecuba
was
seen
daily
gliding
along
at
a
height
of
twenty
feet
or
more
from
the
ground
amongst
the
lower
trees
and
bushes
numerouskinds
of
heliconii
a
group
of
butterflies
peculiar
to
tropical
america
having
long
narrow
wings
were
very
abundant
the
prevailing
ground
colour
of
the
wings
of
these
insects
is
a
deep
black
and
on
this
are
depicted
spots
and
streaks
of
crimson
white
and
bright
yellow
in
different
patterns
according
to
the
species
their
elegant
shape
showy
colours
and
slow
sailing
mode
of
flight
make
them
very
attractive
objects
and
their
numbers
are
so
great
that
they
form
quite
a
feature
in
the
physiognomy
of
the
forest
compensating
for
the
scarcity
of
flowers
next
to
the
heliconii
the
catagrammas
astarte
and
peristera
were
the
most
conspicuous
these
have
a
very
rapid
and
short
flight
settling
frequently
and
remaining
stationary
for
a
long
time
on
the
trunks
of
trees
the
colours
of
their
wings
are
vermilion
and
black
the
surface
having
a
rich
velvety
appearance
the
genus
owes
its
greek
name
catagramma
signifying
a
letter
beneath
to
the
curious
markings
of
the
underside
of
the
wings
resembling
arabic
numerals
the
species
and
varieties
are
of
almost
endless
diversity
but
the
majority
inhabit
the
hot
valleys
of
the
eastern
parts
of
the
andes
another
butterfly
nearly
allied
to
these
callithea
leprieurii
was
also
very
abundant
here
at
the
marshy
head
of
the
pool
before
mentioned
the
wings
are
of
a
rich
colour
with
a
broad
border
of
silvery
green
these
two
groups
of
callithea
and
catagramma
are
found
only
in
tropical
america
chiefly
near
the
equator
and
are
certainly
amongst
the
most
beautiful
productions
of
a
region
where
the
animals
and
plants
seem
to
have
been
fashioned
in
nature
choicest
moulds
a
great
variety
of
other
beautiful
and
curious
insects
adorned
these
pleasant
woods
others
were
seen
only
in
the
sunshine
in
open
places
as
the
waters
retreated
from
the
beach
vast
numbers
of
and
orange
coloured
butterflies
congregated
on
the
moist
sand
the
greater
portion
of
them
belonged
to
the
genus
callidryas
they
assembled
in
masses
sometimes
two
or
three
yards
in
circumference
their
wings
all
held
in
an
upright
position
so
that
the
beach
looked
as
though
variegated
with
beds
of
crocuses
these
callidryades
seem
to
be
migratory
insects
and
have
large
powers
of
dissemination
during
the
last
two
days
of
our
voyage
the
great
numbers
constantly
passing
over
the
river
attracted
the
attention
of
every
one
on
board
they
all
crossed
in
one
direction
namely
from
north
to
south
and
the
processions
were
uninterrupted
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
until
sunset
all
the
individuals
which
resort
to
the
margins
of
sandy
beaches
are
of
the
male
sex
the
females
are
much
more
rare
and
are
seen
only
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
wandering
from
tree
to
tree
and
depositing
their
eggs
on
low
mimosas
which
grow
in
the
shade
the
migrating
hordes
as
far
as
i
could
ascertain
are
composed
only
of
males
and
on
this
account
i
believe
their
wanderings
do
not
extend
very
far
a
strange
kind
of
is
found
in
this
neighbourhood
the
males
of
which
produce
a
very
loud
and
not
unmusical
noise
by
rubbing
together
the
overlapping
edges
of
their
the
notes
are
certainly
the
loudest
and
most
extraordinary
that
i
ever
heard
produced
by
an
orthopterous
insect
the
natives
call
it
the
tanana
in
allusion
to
its
music
which
is
a
sharp
resonant
stridulation
resembling
the
syllables
na
succeeding
each
other
with
little
intermission
it
seems
to
be
rare
in
the
neighbourhood
when
the
natives
capture
one
they
keep
it
in
a
cage
for
the
sake
of
hearing
it
sing
a
friend
of
mine
kept
one
six
days
it
was
lively
only
for
two
or
three
and
then
its
loud
note
could
be
heard
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
when
it
died
he
gave
me
the
specimen
the
only
one
i
was
able
to
procure
it
is
a
member
of
the
family
locustidae
a
group
intermediate
between
the
cricket
achetidae
and
the
grasshoppers
acridiidae
the
total
length
of
the
body
is
two
inches
and
a
quarter
when
the
wings
are
closed
the
insect
has
an
inflated
vesicular
or
shape
owing
to
the
great
convexity
of
the
thin
but

the

been
observed
to
place

in

at

entrance
of
its
burrow
and
stridulate
until
a

approaches

of

music
are
more
uniform
than
the

this
differs
in

of
the
three

have
straight

of

overlap
each

portion
of

in
the
locustidae
the

a
sloping
position
on
each
side
of
the
body
and
do
not
overlap
except
to
a
small
extent
near
their
bases
it
is
out
of
this
small
portion
that
the
stridulating
organ
is
contrived
greater

is
given
in
most
species
by
a
thin
transparent

by
a

as
elsewhere

with

of
indicates
the
great
importance
which
she
attaches
to
this
function
the
music
in
the
males
of
the
acridiidae
is
produced
by
the
scraping
of
the
long
hind
thighs
against
the
horny
nervures
of
the
outer
edges
of
the
a
shaped
organ
placed
in
a
cavity
near
the
insertion
of
the
thighs
being
adapted
to
give
resonance
to
the
tones
i
obtained
very
few
birds
at
obydos
there
was
no
scarcity
of
birds
but
they
were
mostly
common
cayenne
species
in
early
morning
the
woods
near
my
house
were
quite
animated
with
their
songs
an
unusual
thing
in
this
country
i
heard
here
for
the
first
time
the
pleasing
wild
notes
of
the
carashue
a
species
of
thrush
probably
the
mimus
lividus
of
ornithologists
i
found
it
afterwards
to
be
a
common
bird
in
the
scattered
woods
of
the
campo
district
near
santarem
it
is
a
much
smaller
and
coloured
bird
than
our
thrush
and
its
song
is
not
so
loud
varied
or
so
long
sustained
but
the
tone
is
of
a
sweet
and
plaintive
quality
which
harmonises
well
with
the
wild
and
silent
woodlands
where
alone
it
is
heard
in
the
mornings
and
evenings
of
sultry
tropical
days
in
course
of
time
the
song
of
this
humble
thrush
stirred
up
pleasing
associations
in
my
mind
in
the
same
way
as
those
of
its
more
highly
endowed
sisters
formerly
did
at
home
there
are
several
allied
species
in
brazil
in
the
southern
provinces
they
are
called
sabiahs
the
brazilians
are
not
insensible
to
the
charms
of
this
their
best
songster
for
i
often
heard
some
pretty
verses
in
praise
of
the
sabiah
sung
by
young
people
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
guitar
i
found
several
times
the
nest
of
the
carashue
which
is
built
of
dried
grass
and
slender
twigs
and
lined
with
mud
the
eggs
are
coloured
and
spotted
like
those
of
our
blackbird
but
they
are
considerably
smaller
i
was
much
pleased
with
a
brilliant
little
mannikin
which
i
shot
here
pipra
cornuta
there
were
three
males
seated
on
a
low
branch
and
hopping
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
near
to
one
another
as
though
engaged
in
a
kind
of
dance
in
the
pleasant
airy
woods
surrounding
the
sandy
shores
of
the
pool
behind
the

the
trogon

was
very

is
of
a
brilliant
green
colour

often
saw
small
companies
of

a
dozen
individuals
quietly
seated
on
the
lower

of
trees
they
remained
almost
motionless
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
simply
moving
their
heads
on
the
watch
for
passing
insects
or
as
seemed
more
generally
to
be
the
case
scanning
the
neighbouring

for

they
darted
off

at

a

was
proceeding
about
in
a
cuberta
laden
with
merchandise
to
the

negro
intending
to
stop
frequently
on

so
i
bargained
with
him
for
a
passage
he
gave
up
a
part
of
the
toldo
or
as
it
may
be
called
and
here
i
slung
my
hammock
and
arranged
my
boxes
so
as
to
be
able
to
work
as
we
went
along
the
stoppages
i
thought
would
be
an
advantage
as
i
could
collect
in
the
woods
whilst
he
traded
and
thus
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
productions
of
many
places
on
the
river
which
on
a
direct
voyage
would
be
impossible
to
do
i
provided
a

of

for

consumption
and
after
the
usual
amount
of
unnecessary
fuss
and
delay
on
the
part
of

we
started

took

comprised
a

lively
mameluco
woman
named

whom

called

of
the

in

he
tried
to
make
me
as
comfortable
as
the
circumstances
admitted
and
provided
a
large
stock
of
eatables
and
drinkables
so
that
altogether
the
voyage
promised
to
be
a
pleasant
one
on
leaving
the
port
of
obydos
we
crossed
over
to
the
right

and
sailed
with
a
light

all

passing
numerous
houses

surrounded
by
its

of

landed
at

of
the
cacao
plantations
the
house
was
substantially
built
the
walls
formed
of
strong
upright
posts
lathed
across
plastered
with
mud
and
whitewashed
and
the
roof
tiled
the
family
were
mamelucos
and
seemed
to
be
an
average
sample
of
the
poorer
class
of
cacao
growers
all
were
loosely
dressed
and
a
broad
verandah
extended
along
one
side
of
the
house
the
floor
of
which
was
simply
the
trodden
earth
and
here
hammocks
were
slung
between
the
bare
upright
supports
a
large
rush
mat
being
spread
on
the
ground
upon
which
the
stout
mistress
with
a
tame
parrot
perched
upon
her
shoulder
sat
sewing
with
two
pretty
little
mulatto
girls
the
master
coolly
clad
in
shirt
and
drawers
the
former
loose
about
the
neck
lay
in
his
hammock
smoking
a
long
wooden
pipe
the
household
utensils
earthenware
jars
and
saucepans
lay
at
one
end
near
which
was
a
wood
fire
with
the
simmering
on
the
top
of
a
clay
tripod
a
large
shed
stood
a
short
distance
off
embowered
in
a
grove
of
banana
papaw
and
mango
trees
and
under
it
were
the
ovens
troughs
sieves
and
all
other
apparatus
for
the
preparation
of
mandioca
the
cleared
space
around
the
house
was
only
a
few
yards
in
extent
beyond
it
lay
the
cacao
plantations
which
stretched
on
each
side
parallel
to
the
banks
of
the
river
there
was
a
path
through
the
forest
which
led
to
the
mandioca
fields
and
several
miles
beyond
to
other
houses
on
the
banks
of
an
interior
channel
we
were
kindly
received
as
is
always
the
case
when
a
stranger
visits
these
habitations
the
people
being
invariably
civil
and
hospitable
we
had
a
long
chat
took
coffee
and
upon
departing
one
of
the
daughters
sent
a
basket
full
of
oranges
for
our
use
down
to
the
canoe
the
cost
of
a
cacao
plantation
in
the
obydos
district
is
after
the
rate
of
reis
or
sixpence
per
tree
which
is
much
higher
than
at
cameta
where
i
believe
the
yield
is
not
so
great
the
forest
here
is
cleared
before
planting
and
the
trees
are
grown
in
rows
the
smaller
cultivators
are
all
very
poor
labour
is
scarce
one
family
generally
manages
its
own
small
plantation
of
to
trees
but
at
the
harvest
time
neighbours
assist
each
other
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
an
easy
pleasant
life
the
work
is
all
done
under
shade
and
occupies
only
a
few
weeks
in
the
year
the
incorrigible
nonchalance
and
laziness
of
the
people
alone
prevent
them
from
surrounding
themselves
with
all
the
luxuries
of
a
tropical
country
they
might
plant
orchards
of
the
choicest
fruit
trees
around
their
houses
grow
indian
corn
and
rear
cattle
and
hogs
as
intelligent
settlers
from
europe
would
certainly
do
instead
of
indolently
relying
solely
on
the
produce
of
their
small
plantations
and
living
on
a
meagre
diet
of
fish
and
farinha
in
preparing
the
cacao
they
have
not
devised
any
means
of
separating
the
seeds
well
from
the
pulp
or
drying
it
in
a
systematic
way
the
consequence
is
that
although
naturally
of
good
quality
it
molds
before
reaching
the
merchants
stores
and
does
not
fetch
more
than
half
the
price
of
the
same
article
grown
in
other
parts
of
tropical
america
the
amazons
region
is
the
original
home
of
the
principal
species
of
chocolate
tree
the
theobroma
cacao
and
it
grows
in
abundance
in
the
forests
of
the
upper
river
the
cultivated
crop
appears
to
be
a
precarious
one
little
or
no
care
however
is
bestowed
on
the
trees
and
even
weeding
is
done
very
inefficiently
the
plantations
are
generally
old
and
have
been
made
on
the
low
ground
near
the
river
which
renders
them
liable
to
inundation
when
this
rises
a
few
inches
more
than
the
average
there
is
plenty
of
higher
land
quite
suitable
to
the
tree
but
it
is
uncleared
and
the
want
of
labour
and
enterprise
prevents
the
establishment
of
new
plantations
we
passed
the
last
houses
in
the
obydos
district
on
the
and
the
river
scenery
then
resumed
its
usual
wild
and
solitary
character
which
the
scattered
human
habitations
relieved
although
in
a
small
degree
we
soon
fell
into
a
regular
mode
of
life

our
little
ark
penna
would
not
travel
by

indeed
our
small
crew
wearied
by
the
day
labour
required
rest
and
we
very
rarely
had
wind
in
the
night
we
used
to
moor
the
vessel
to
a
tree
giving
out
plenty
of
cable
so
as
to
sleep
at
a
distance
from
the
banks
and
free
of
mosquitoes
which
although
swarming
in
the
forest
rarely
came
many
yards
out
into
the
river
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
strong
current
at
a
distance
of
thirty
or
forty
yards
from
the
coast
steadied
the
cuberta
head
to
stream
and
kept
us
from
drifting
ashore
we
all
slept
in
the
open

the
heat
of
the

was
stifling

the
only

the
decrease

at

never
so
great

be

as
a
delightful

sweltering
heat

the
afternoons
we
used

rise
when
the
first
gleam
of
dawn
showed
itself
above

long
dark
line

our

and

were
then
generally
soaked
with

this
was
not

to
be
an
inconvenience
the

to
revive
himself
by
a
plunge
in

the

rowed
if

there
was
no

by

great
force
close

these
receded
to
form
long

they
are
called

yards
out
is
encumbered
with
fallen
trees
whose
branches
quiver
in
the
current
when
projecting
points
of
land
were
encountered
it
was
impossible
with
our
weak
crew
to
pull
the
cuberta
against
the
whirling
torrents
which
set
round
them
and
in
such
cases
we
had
to
cross
the
river
drifting
often
with
the
current
a
mile
or
two
lower
down
on
the
opposite
shore
there
generally
sprung
a
light
wind
as
the
day
advanced
and
then
we
took
down
our
hammocks
hoisted
all
sail
and
bowled
away
merrily
penna
generally
preferred
to
cook
the
dinner
ashore
when
there
was
little
or
no
wind
about
midday
on
these
calm
days
we
used
to
look
out
for
a
nice
shady
nook
in
the
forest
with
cleared
space
sufficient
to
make
a
fire
upon
i
then
had
an
hour
hunting
in
the
neighbouring
wilderness
and
was
always
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
some
new
species
during
the
greater
part
of
our
voyage
however
we
stopped
at
the
house
of
some
settler
and
made
our
fire
in
the
port
just
before
dinner
it
was
our
habit
to
take
a
bath
in
the
river
and
then
according
to
the
universal
custom
on
the
amazons
where
it
seems
to
be
suitable
on
account
of
the
weak
fish
diet
we
each
took
half
a
full
of
neat
cashaca
the
abre
or
opening
as
it
is
called
and
set
to
on
our
mess
of
stewed
pirarucu
beans
and
bacon
once
or
twice
a
week
we
had
fowls
and
rice
at
supper
after
sunset
we
often
had
fresh
fish
caught
by
our
men
in
the
evening
the
mornings
were
cool
and
pleasant
until
towards
midday
but
in
the
afternoons
the
heat
became
almost
intolerable
especially
in
gleamy
squally
weather
such
as
generally
prevailed
we
then
crouched
in
the
shade
of
the
sails
or
went
down
to
our
hammocks
in
the
cabin
choosing
to
be
half
stifled
rather
than
expose
ourselves
on
deck
to
the
sickening
heat
of
the
sun
we
generally
ceased
travelling
about
nine
fixing
upon
a
safe
spot
wherein
to
secure
the
vessel
for
the
night
the
cool
evening
hours
were
delicious
flocks
of
whistling
ducks
anas
autumnalis
parrots
and
macaws
pair
by
pair
flew
over
from
their
feeding
to
their
resting
places
as
the
glowing
sun
plunged
abruptly
beneath
the
horizon
the
brief
evening
chorus
of
animals
then
began
the
chief
performers
being
the
howling
monkeys
whose
frightful
unearthly
roar
deepened
the
feeling
of
solitude
which
crept
up
as
darkness
closed
around
us
soon
after
the
fireflies
in
great
diversity
of
species
came
forth
and
flitted
about
the
trees
as
night
advanced
all
became
silent
in
the
forest
save
the
occasional
hooting
of
or
the
monotonous
chirping
of
and
grasshoppers
we
made
but
little
progress
on
the
and
two
following
days
on
account
of
the
unsteadiness
of
the
wind
the
dry
season
had
been
of
very
brief
duration
this
year
it
generally
lasts
in
this
part
of
the
amazons
from
july
to
january
with
a
short
interval
of
showery
weather
in
november
the
river
ought
to
sink
thirty
or
feet
below
its
highest
point
this
year
it
had
declined
only
about
feet
and
the
november
rains
threatened
to
be
continuous
the
drier
the
weather
the
stronger
blows
the
east
wind
it
now
failed
us
altogether
or
blew
gently
for
a
few
hours
merely
in
the
afternoons
i
had
hitherto
seen
the
great
river
only
in
its
sunniest
aspect
i
was
now
about
to
witness
what
it
could
furnish
in
the
way
of
storms
on
the
night
of
the
the
moon
appeared
with
a
misty
halo
as
we
went
to
rest
a
fresh
watery
wind
was
blowing
and
a
dark
pile
of
clouds
gathered
up
river
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
of
the
wind
i
thought
this
betokened
nothing
more
than
a
heavy
rain
which
would
send
us
all
in
a
hurry
to
our
cabins
the
men
moored
the
vessel
to
a
tree
alongside
a
hard
clayey
bank
and
after
supper
all
were
soon
fast
asleep
scattered
about
the
raised
deck
about
eleven
i
was
awakened
by
a
horrible
uproar
as
a
hurricane
of
wind
suddenly
swept
over
from
the
opposite
shore
the
cuberta
was
hurled
with
force
against
the
clayey
bank
penna
shouted
out
as
he
started
to
his
legs
that
a
trovoada
de
cima
or
a
squall
from
was
upon
us
we
took
down
our
hammocks
and
then
all
hands
were
required
to
save
the
vessel
from
being
dashed
to
pieces
the
moon
set
and
a
black
pall
of
clouds
spread
itself
over
the
dark
forests
and
river
a
frightful
crack
of
thunder
now
burst
over
our
heads
and
down
fell
the
drenching
rain
joaquim
leapt
ashore
through
the
drowning
spray
with
a
strong
pole
and
tried
to
pass
the
cuberta
round
a
small
projecting
point
while
we
on
deck
aided
in
keeping
her
off
and
lengthened
the
cable
we
succeeded
in
getting
free
and
the
boat
fell
off
into
the
strong
current
farther
away
from
the
shore
joaquim
swinging
himself
dexterously
aboard
by
the
bowsprit
as
it
passed
the
point
it
was
fortunate
for
us
that
he
happened
to
be
on
a
sloping
clayey
bank
where
there
was
no
fear
of
falling
trees
a
few
yards
farther
on
where
the
shore
was
perpendicular
and
formed
of
crumbly
earth
large
portions
of
loose
soil
with
all
their
superincumbent
mass
of
forest
were
being
washed
away
the
uproar
thus
occasioned
adding
to
the
horrors
of
the
storm
the
violence
of
the
wind
abated
in
the
course
of
an
hour
but
the
deluge
of
rain
continued
until
about
three
in
the
morning
the
sky
was
lighted
up
by
almost
incessant
flashes
of
pallid
lightning
and
the
thunder
pealing
from
side
to
side
without
interruption
our
clothing
hammocks
and
goods
were
thoroughly
soaked
by
the
streams
of
water
which
trickled
through
between
the
planks
in
the
morning
all
was
quiet
but
an
opaque
leaden
mass
of
clouds
overspread
the
sky
throwing
a
gloom
over
the
wild
landscape
that
had
a
most
dispiriting
effect
these
squalls
from
the
west
are
always
expected
about
the
time
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
dry
season
in
these
central
parts
of
the
lower
amazons
they
generally
take
place
about
the
beginning
of
february
so
that
this
year
they
had
commenced
much
earlier
than
usual
the
soil
and
climate
are
much
drier
in
this
part
of
the
country
than
in
the
region
lying
farther
to
the
west
where
the
denser
forests
and
more
clayey
humid
soil
produce
a
considerably
cooler
atmosphere
the
storms
may
be
therefore
attributed
to
the
rush
of
cold
moist
air
from
up
river
when
the
regular
wind
coming
from
the
sea
has
slackened
or
ceased
to
blow
on
the
we
arrived
at
a
large
sand
bank
connected
with
an
island
in
in
front
of
an
inlet
called
here
we
anchored
and
spent
half
a
day
ashore
penna
object
in
stopping
was
simply
to
enjoy
a
ramble
on
the
sands
with
the
children
and
give
senora
katita
an
opportunity
to
wash
the
linen
the
sandbank
was
now
fast
going
under
water
with
the
rise
of
the
river
in
the
middle
of
the
dry
season
it
is
about
a
mile
long
and
half
a
mile
in
width
the
delight
in
these
open
spaces
which
are
a
great
relief
to
the
monotony
of
the
forest
that
clothes
the
land
in
every
other
part
of
the
river
farther
westward
they
are
much
more
frequent
and
of
larger
extent
they
lie
generally
at
the
upper
end
of
islands
in
fact
the
latter
originate
in
accretions
of
vegetable
matter
formed
by
plants
and
trees
growing
on
a
shoal
the
island
was
wooded
chiefly
with
the
trumpet
tree
cecropia
peltata
which
has
a
hollow
stem
and
smooth
pale
bark
the
leaves
are
similar
in
shape
to
those
of
the
but
immensely
larger
beneath
they
are
white
and
when
the
welcome
blows
they
show
their
silvery
undersides
a
pleasant
signal
to
the
weary
canoe
traveller
the
mode
of
growth
of
this
tree
is
curious
the
branches
are
emitted
at
nearly
right
angles
with
the
stem
the
branchlets
in
minor
whorls
around
these
and
so
forth
the
leaves
growing
at
their
extremities
so
that
the
total
appearance
is
that
of
a
huge
candelabrum
cecropiae
of
different
species
are
characteristic
of
brazilian
forest
scenery
the
kind
of
which
i
am
speaking
grows
in
great
numbers
everywhere
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
where
the
land
is
low
in
the
same
places
the
curious
monguba
tree
bombax
ceiba
is
also
plentiful
the
dark
green
bark
of
its
huge
tapering
trunk
scored
with
grey
forming
a
conspicuous
object
the
principal
palm
tree
on
the
lowlands
is
the
jauari
astrvocaryum
jauari
whose
stem
surrounded
by
whorls
of
spines
shoots
up
to
a
great
height
on
the
borders
of
the
island
were
large
tracts
of
gynerium
saccharoides
which
bears
elegant
plumes
of
flowers
like
those
of
the
reed
and
grows
to
a
height
of
twenty
feet
the
leaves
arranged
in
a
figure
near
the
middle
of
the
stem
i
was
surprised
to
find
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
sandbank
the
familiar
foliage
of
a
willow
salix
humboldtiana
it
is
a
dwarf
species
and
grows
in
patches
resembling
beds
of
osiers
as
in
the
english
willows
the
leaves
were
peopled
by
small
chrysomelideous
beetles
in
wandering
about
many
features
reminded
me
of
the
seashore
flocks
of
white
gulls
were
flying
overhead
uttering
their
known
cry
and
sandpipers
coursed
along
the
edge
of
the
water
here
and
there
lonely
were
stalking
about
one
of
these
the
curiaca
ibis
melanopis
flew
up
with
a
low
cackling
noise
and
was
soon
joined
by
a
unicorn
bird
palamedea
cornuta
which
i
startled
up
from
amidst
the
bushes
whose
harsh
screams
resembling
the
bray
of
a
jackass
but
shriller
disturbed
unpleasantly
the
solitude
of
the
place
amongst
the
willow
bushes
were
flocks
of
a
handsome
bird
belonging
to
the
icteridae
or
troupial
family
adorned
with
a
rich
plumage
of
black
and
i
spent
some
time
watching
an
assemblage
of
a
species
of
bird
called
by
the
natives
on
the
cecropia
trees
it
is
the
monasa
nigrifrons
of
ornithologists
and
has
a
plain
plumage
with
the
beak
of
an
orange
hue
it
belongs
to
the
family
of
barbets
most
of
whose
members
are
remarkable
for
their
dull
inactive
temperament
those
species
which
are
arranged
by
ornithologists
under
the
genus
bucco
are
called
by
the
indians
in
the
tupi
language
uira
or
they
remain
seated
sometimes
for
hours
together
on
low
branches
in
the
shade
and
are
stimulated
to
exertion
only
when
attracted
by
passing
insects
this
flock
of
were
the
reverse
of
dull
they
were
gambolling
and
chasing
each
other
amongst
the
branches
as
they
sported
about
each
emitted
a
few
short
tuneful
notes
which
altogether
produced
a
ringing
musical
chorus
that
quite
surprised
me
on
the
we
reached
an
elevated
wooded
promontory
called
parentins
which
now
forms
the
boundary
between
the
provinces
of
para
and
the
amazons
here
we
met
a
small
canoe
descending
to
santarem
the
owner
was
a
free
negro
named
lima
who
with
his
wife
was
going
down
the
river
to
exchange
his
year
crop
of
tobacco
for
european
merchandise
the
long
shallow
canoe
was
laden
nearly
to
the
water
level
he
resided
on
the
banks
of
the
abacaxi
a
river
which
discharges
its
waters
into
the
canoma
a
broad
interior
channel
which
extends
from
the
river
madeira
to
the
parentins
a
distance
of
miles
penna
offered
him
advantageous
terms
so
a
bargain
was
struck
and
the
man
saved
his
long
journey
the
negro
seemed
a
frank
straightforward
fellow
he
was
a
native
of
pernambuco
but
had
settled
many
years
ago
in
this
part
of
the
country
he
had
with
him
a
little
indian
girl
belonging
to
the
mauhes
tribe
whose
native
seat
is
the
district
of
country
lying
in
the
rear
of
the
canoma
between
the
madeira
and
the
tapajos
the
mauhes
are
considered
i
think
with
truth
to
be
a
branch
of
the
great
mundurucu
nation
having
segregated
from
them
at
a
remote
period
and
by
long
isolation
acquired
different
customs
and
a
totally
different
language
in
a
manner
which
seems
to
have
been
general
with
the
brazilian
aborigines
the
mundurucus
seem
to
have
retained
more
of
the
general
characteristics
of
the
original
tupi
stock
than
the
mauhes
senor
lima
told
me
what
i
afterwards
found
to
be
correct
that
there
were
scarcely
two
words
alike
in
the
languages
of
the
two
peoples
although
there
are
words
closely
allied
to
tupi
in
both
the
little
girl
had
not
the
slightest
trace
of
the
savage
in
her
appearance
her
features
were
finely
shaped
the
cheekbones
not
at
all
prominent
the
lips
thin
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
frank
and
smiling
she
had
been
brought
only
a
few
weeks
previously
from
a
remote
settlement
of
her
tribe
on
the
banks
of
the
abacaxi
and
did
not
yet
know
five
words
of
portuguese
the
indians
as
a
general
rule
are
very
manageable
when
they
are
young
but
it
is
a
general
complaint
that
when
they
reach
the
age
of
puberty
they
become
restless
and
discontented
the
rooted
impatience
of
all
restraint
then
shows
itself
and
the
kindest
treatment
will
not
prevent
them
running
away
from
their
masters
they
do
not
return
to
the
malocas
of
their
tribes
but
join
parties
who
go
out
to
collect
the
produce
of
the
forests
and
rivers
and
lead
a
wandering
kind
of
life
we
remained
under
the
serra
dos
parentins
all
night
early
the
next
morning
a
light
mist
hung
about
the
and
the
forest
resounded
with
the
yelping
of
monkeys
i
went
ashore
with
my
gun
and
got
a
glimpse
of
the
flock
but
did
not
succeed
in
obtaining
a
specimen
they
were
of
small
size
and
covered
with
long
fur
of
a
uniform
grey
colour
i
think
the
species
was
the
callithrix
donacophilus
the
rock
composing
the
elevated
ridge
of
the
parentins
is
the
same
coarse
conglomerate
which
i
have
often
spoken
of
as
occurring
near
para
and
in
several
other
places
many
loose
blocks
were
scattered
about
the
forest
was
extremely
varied
and
inextricable
coils
of
woody
climbers
stretched
from
tree
to
tree
throngs
of
cacti
were
spread
over
the
rocks
and
the
variety
of
small
ferns
lichens
and
boleti
made
the
place
quite
a
museum
of
cryptogamic
plants
i
found
here
two
exquisite
species
of
longicorn
beetles
and
a
large
kind
of
grasshopper
pterochroza
whose
broad
resembled
the
leaf
of
a
plant
providing
the
insect
with
a
perfect
disguise
when
they
were
closed
while
the
hind
wings
were
decorated
with
coloured
spots
the
negro
left
us
and
turned
up
a
narrow
channel
the
mirim
dos
ramos
the
little
river
of
the
branches
having
many
ramifications
on
the
road
to
his
home
miles
distant
we
then
continued
our
voyage
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
villa
nova
a
straggling
village
containing
about
seventy
houses
many
of
which
scarcely
deserve
the
name
being
mere
roofed
with
we
stayed
here
four
days
the
village
is
built
on
a
rocky
bank
composed
of
the
same
coarse
conglomerate
as
that
already
so
often
mentioned
in
some
places
a
bed
of
tabatinga
clay
rests
on
the
conglomerate
the
soil
in
the
neighbourhood
is
sandy
and
the
forest
most
of
which
appears
to
be
of
second
growth
is
traversed
by
broad
alleys
which
terminate
to
the
south
and
east
on
the
banks
of
pools
and
lakes
a
chain
of
which
extends
through
the
interior
of
the
land
as
soon
as
we
anchored
i
set
off
with
luco
to
explore
the
district
we
walked
about
a
mile
along
the
marly
shore
on
which
was
a
thick
carpet
of
flowering
shrubs
enlivened
by
a
great
variety
of
lovely
little
butterflies
and
then
entered
the
forest
by
a
dry
watercourse
about
a
furlong
inland
this
opened
on
a
broad
placid
pool
whose
banks
clothed
with
grass
of
the
softest
green
hue
sloped
gently
from
the
water
edge
to
the
compact
wall
of
forest
which
encompassed
the
whole
the
pool
swarmed
with
snowy
egrets
striped
herons
and
storks
of
various
species
standing
in
rows
around
its
margins
small
flocks
of
macaws
were
stirring
about
the
topmost
branches
of
the
trees
piosocas
perra
jacana
stalked
over
the
water
plants
on
the
surface
of
the
pool
and
in
the
bushes
on
its
margin
were
great
numbers
of
a
kind
of
canary
sycalis
brasiliensis
of
a
colour
which
has
a
short
and
not
very
melodious
song
we
had
advanced
but
a
few
steps
when
we
startled
a
pair
of
the
mycteria
americana
a
powerful
bird
of
the
stork
family
four
and
a
half
feet
in
height
which
flew
up
and
alarmed
the
rest
so
that
i
got
only
one
bird
out
of
the
tumultuous
flocks
which
passed
over
our
heads
passing
towards
the
farther
end
of
the
pool
i
saw
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
number
of
large
round
leaves
turned
up
at
their
edges
they
belonged
to
the
victoria
the
leaves
were
just
beginning
to
expand
december
some
were
still
under
water
and
the
largest
of
those
which
had
reached
the
surface
measured
not
quite
three
feet
in
diameter
we
found
a
montaria
with
a
paddle
in
it
drawn
up
on
the
bank
which
i
took
leave
to
borrow
of
the
unknown
owner
and
luco
paddled
me
amongst
the
noble
plants
to
search
for
flowers
meeting
however
with
no
success
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
plant
is
common
in
nearly
all
the
lakes
of
this
neighbourhood
the
natives
call
it
the
furno
do
piosoca
or
oven
of
the
jacana
the
shape
of
the
leaves
being
like
that
of
the
ovens
on
which
mandioca
meal
is
roasted
we
saw
many
kinds
of
hawks
and
eagles
one
of
which
a
black
species
the
milvago
nudicollis
sat
on
the
top
of
a
tall
naked
stump
uttering
its
hypocritical
whining
notes
this
eagle
is
considered
a
bird
of
ill
omen
by
the
indians
it
often
perches
on
the
tops
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
huts
and
is
then
said
to
bring
a
warning
of
death
to
some
member
of
the
household
others
say
that
its
whining
cry
is
intended
to
attract
other
defenseless
birds
within
its
reach
the
little
courageous
flycatcher
saurophagus
sulphuratus
assembles
in
companies
of
four
or
five
and
attacks
it
boldly
driving
it
from
the
perch
where
it
would
otherwise
sit
for
hours
i
shot
three
hawks
of
as
many
different
species
and
these
with
a
magoary
stork
two
beautiful
jacamars
galbula
chalcocephala
and
leaves
of
the
made
a
heavy
load
with
which
we
trudged
off
back
to
the
canoe
a
few
years
after
this
visit
namely
in
i
passed
eight
months
at
villa
nova
the
district
of
which
it
is
the
chief
town
is
very
extensive
for
it
has
about
forty
miles
of
linear
extent
along
the
banks
of
the
river
but
the
whole
does
not
contain
more
than
inhabitants
more
than
half
of
these
are
pureblood
indians
who
live
in
a
condition
on
the
banks
of
the
numerous
channels
and
lakes
the
trade
of
the
place
is
chiefly
in
balsam
of
copaiba
which
are
collected
on
the
banks
of
the
madeira
and
the
numerous
rivers
that
enter
the
canoma
channel
and
salt
fish
prepared
in
the
dry
season
nearer
home
these
articles
are
sent
to
para
in
exchange
for
european
goods
the
few
indian
and
families
who
reside
in
the
town
are
many
shades
inferior
in
personal
qualities
and
social
condition
to
those
i
lived
amongst
near
para
and
cameta
they
live
in
wretched
dilapidated
the
women
cultivate
small
patches
of
mandioca
the
men
spend
most
of
their
time
in
fishing
selling
what
they
do
not
require
themselves
and
getting
drunk
with
the
most
exemplary
regularity
on
cashaca
purchased
with
the
proceeds
i
made
in
this
second
visit
to
villa
nova
an
extensive
collection
of
the
natural
productions
of
the
neighbourhood
a
few
remarks
on
some
of
the
more
interesting
of
these
must
suffice
the
forests
are
very
different
in
their
general
character
from
those
of
para
and
in
fact
those
of
humid
districts
generally
throughout
the
amazons
the
same
scarcity
of
musaceous
and
marantaceous
plants
was
noticeable
here
as
at
obydos
the
areas
of
forest
or
ygapos
which
alternate
everywhere
with
the
more
elevated
districts
did
not
furnish
the
same
luxuriant
vegetation
as
they
do
in
the
delta
region
of
the
amazons
they
are
flooded
during
three
or
four
months
in
the
year
and
when
the
waters
retire
the
soil
to
which
the
very
thin
coating
of
alluvial
deposit
imparts
little
fertility
remains
bare
or
covered
with
a
matted
bed
of
dead
leaves
until
the
next
flood
season
these
tracts
have
then
a
barren
appearance
the
trunks
and
lower
branches
of
the
trees
are
coated
with
dried
slime
and
disfigured
by
rounded
masses
of
sponges
whose
long
horny
spiculae
and
dingy
colours
give
them
the
appearance
of
hedgehogs
dense
bushes
of
a
harsh
cutting
grass
called
tiririca
form
almost
the
only
fresh
vegetation
in
the
dry
season
perhaps
the
dense
shade
the
long
period
during
which
the
land
remains
under
water
and
the
excessively
rapid
desiccation
when
the
waters
retire
all
contribute
to
the
barrenness
of
these
ygapos
the
higher
and
drier
land
is
everywhere
sandy
and
tall
coarse
grasses
line
the
borders
of
the
broad
alleys
which
have
been
cut
through
the
woods
these
places
swarm
with
carapatos
ugly
ticks
belonging
to
the
genus
ixodes
which
mount
to
the
tips
of
blades
of
grass
and
attach
themselves
to
the
clothes
of
they
are
a
great
annoyance
it
occupied
me
a
full
hour
daily
to
pick
them
off
my
flesh
after
my
diurnal
ramble
there
are
two
species
both
are
much
flattened
in
shape
have
four
pairs
of
legs
a
thick
short
proboscis
and
a
horny
integument
their
habit
is
to
attach
themselves
to
the
skin
by
plunging
their
proboscides
into
it
and
then
suck
the
blood
until
their
flat
bodies
are
distended
into
a
globular
form
the
whole
proceeding
however
is
very
slow
and
it
takes
them
several
days
to
pump
their
fill
no
pain
or
itching
is
felt
but
serious
sores
are
caused
if
care
is
not
taken
in
removing
them
as
the
proboscis
is
liable
to
break
off
and
remain
in
the
wound
a
little
tobacco
juice
is
generally
applied
to
make
them
loosen
their
hold
they
do
not
cling
firmly
to
the
skin
by
their
legs
although
each
of
these
has
a
pair
of
sharp
and
fine
claws
connected
with
the
tips
of
the
member
by
means
of
a
flexible
pedicle
when
they
mount
to
the
summits
of
slender
blades
of
grass
or
the
tips
of
leaves
they
hold
on
by
their
forelegs
only
the
other
three
pairs
being
stretched
out
so
as
to
fasten
onto
any
animal
which
comes
their
way
the
smaller
of
the
two
species
is
of
a
yellowish
colour
it
is
the
most
abundant
and
sometimes
falls
upon
one
by
scores
when
distended
it
is
about
the
size
of
a
no
shot
the
larger
kind
which
fortunately
comes
only
singly
to
the
work
swells
to
the
size
of
a
pea
in
some
parts
of
the
interior
the
soil
is
composed
of
very
coarse
sand
and
small
fragments
of
quartz
in
these
places
no
trees
grow
i
visited
in
company
with
the
priest
padre
torquato
one
of
these
treeless
spaces
or
campos
as
they
are
called
situated
five
miles
from
the
village
the
road
thither
led
through
a
varied
and
beautiful
forest
containing
many
gigantic
trees
i
missed
the
assai
mirti
paxiuba
and
other
palms
which
are
all
found
only
on
rich
moist
soils
but
the
noble
bacaba
was
not
uncommon
and
there
was
a
great
diversity
of
dwarf
species
of
maraja
palms
bactris
one
of
which
called
the
peuririma
was
very
elegant
growing
to
a
height
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
with
a
stem
no
thicker
than
a
man
finger
on
arriving
at
the
campo
all
this
beautiful
forest
abruptly
ceased
and
we
saw
before
us
an
oval
tract
of
land
three
or
four
miles
in
circumference
destitute
even
of
the
smallest
bush
the
only
vegetation
was
a
crop
of
coarse
hairy
grass
growing
in
patches
the
forest
formed
a
hedge
all
round
the
isolated
field
and
its
borders
were
composed
in
great
part
of
trees
which
do
not
grow
in
the
dense
virgin
forest
such
as
a
great
variety
of
bushy
melastomas
low
byrsomina
trees
myrtles
and
whose
berries
exude
globules
of
wax
resembling
gamboge
on
the
margins
of
the
campo
wild
pineapples
also
grew
in
great
quantity
the
fruit
was
of
the
same
shape
as
our
cultivated
kind
but
much
smaller
the
size
being
that
of
a
moderately
large
apple
we
gathered
several
quite
ripe
ones
they
were
pleasant
to
the
taste
of
the
true
pineapple
flavour
but
had
an
abundance
of
fully
developed
seeds
and
only
a
small
quantity
of
eatable
pulp
there
was
no
path
beyond
this
campo
in
fact
all
beyond
is
terra
incognita
to
the
inhabitants
of
villa
nova
the
only
interesting
mammalian
animal
which
i
saw
at
villa
nova
was
a
monkey
of
a
species
new
to
me
it
was
not
however
a
native
of
the
district
having
been
brought
by
a
trader
from
the
river
madeira
a
few
miles
above
borba
it
was
a
howler
probably
the
mycetes
stramineus
of
geoffroy
hilaire
the
howlers
are
the
only
kinds
of
monkey
which
the
natives
have
not
succeeded
in
taming
they
are
often
caught
but
they
do
not
survive
captivity
many
weeks
the
one
of
which
i
am
speaking
was
not
quite
full
grown
it
measured
sixteen
inches
in
length
exclusive
of
the
tail
the
whole
body
was
covered
with
rather
long
and
shining
hair
the
whiskers
and
beard
only
being
of
a
tawny
hue
it
was
kept
in
a
house
together
with
a
coaita
and
a
caiarara
monkey
cebus
albifrons
both
these
lively
members
of
the
monkey
order
seemed
rather
to
court
attention
but
the
mycetes
slunk
away
when
anyone
approached
it
when
it
first
arrived
it
occasionally
made
a
gruff
subdued
howling
noise
early
in
the
morning
the
deep
volume
of
sound
in
the
voice
of
the
howling
monkeys
as
is
well
known
is
produced
by
a
expansion
of
the
larynx
it
was
curious
to
watch
the
animal
while
venting
its
hollow
cavernous
roar
and
observe
how
small
was
the
muscular
exertion
employed
when
howlers
are
seen
in
the
forest
there
are
generally
three
or
four
of
them
mounted
on
the
topmost
branches
of
a
tree
it
does
not
appear
that
their
harrowing
roar
is
emitted
from
sudden
alarm
at
least
it
was
not
so
in
captive
individuals
it
is
probable
however
that
the
noise
serves
to
intimidate
their
enemies
i
did
not
meet
with
the
mycetes
stramineus
in
any
other
part
of
the
amazons
region
in
the
neighbourhood
of
para
a
species
prevails
belzebuth
in
the
narrow
channels
near
breves
i
shot
a
large
entirely
black
kind
another
species
according
to
the
report
of
the
natives
inhabits
the
island
of
macajo
which
is
probably
the
flavimanus
of
kuhl
some
distance
up
the
tapajos
the
only
howler
found
is
a
species
and
on
the
upper
amazons
the
sole
species
seen
was
the
mycetes
ursinus
whose
fur
is
of
a
shining
colour
in
the
dry
forests
of
villa
nova
i
saw
a
rattlesnake
for
the
first
time
i
was
returning
home
one
day
through
a
narrow
alley
when
i
heard
a
pattering
noise
close
to
me
hard
by
was
a
tall
palm
tree
whose
head
was
heavily
weighted
with
parasitic
plants
and
i
thought
the
noise
was
a
warning
that
it
was
about
to
fall
the
wind
lulled
for
a
few
moments
and
then
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
noise
proceeded
from
the
ground
on
turning
my
head
in
that
direction
a
sudden
plunge
startled
me
and
a
heavy
gliding
motion
betrayed
a
large
serpent
making
off
almost
from
beneath
my
feet
the
ground
is
always
so
encumbered
with
rotting
leaves
and
branches
that
one
only
discovers
snakes
when
they
are
in
the
act
of
moving
away
the
residents
of
villa
nova
would
not
believe
that
i
had
seen
a
rattlesnake
in
their
neighbourhood
in
fact
it
is
not
known
to
occur
in
the
forests
at
all
its
place
being
the
open
campos
where
near
santarem
i
killed
several
on
my
second
visit
to
villa
nova
i
saw
another
i
had
then
a
favourite
little
dog
named
diamante
who
used
to
accompany
me
in
my
rambles
one
day
he
rushed
into
the
thicket
and
made
a
dead
set
at
a
large
snake
whose
head
i
saw
raised
above
the
herbage
the
foolish
little
brute
approached
quite
close
and
then
the
serpent
reared
its
tail
slightly
in
a
horizontal
position
and
shook
its
terrible
rattle
it
was
many
minutes
before
i
could
get
the
dog
away
and
this
incident
as
well
as
the
one
already
related
shows
how
slow
the
reptile
is
to
make
the
fatal
spring
i
was
much
annoyed
and
at
the
same
time
amused
with
the
urubu
vultures
the
portuguese
call
them
corvos
or
crows
in
colour
and
general
appearance
they
somewhat
resemble
rooks
but
they
are
much
larger
and
have
naked
black
wrinkled
skin
about
their
face
and
throat
they
assemble
in
great
numbers
in
the
villages
about
the
end
of
the
wet
season
and
are
then
ravenous
with
hunger
my
cook
could
not
leave
the
kitchen
open
at
the
back
of
the
house
for
a
moment
while
the
dinner
was
cooking
on
account
of
their
thievish
propensities
some
of
them
were
always
loitering
about
watching
their
opportunity
and
the
instant
the
kitchen
was
left
unguarded
the
bold
marauders
marched
in
and
lifted
the
lids
off
the
saucepans
with
their
beaks
to
rob
them
of
their
contents
the
boys
of
the
village
lie
in
wait
and
shoot
them
with
bow
and
arrow
and
vultures
have
consequently
acquired
such
a
dread
of
these
weapons
that
they
may
be
often
kept
off
by
hanging
a
bow
from
the
rafters
of
the
kitchen
as
the
dry
season
advances
the
hosts
of
urubus
follow
the
fishermen
to
the
lakes
where
they
gorge
themselves
with
the
offal
of
the
fisheries
towards
february
they
return
to
the
villages
and
are
then
not
nearly
so
ravenous
as
before
their
summer
trips
the
insects
of
villa
nova
are
to
a
great
extent
the
same
as
those
of
santarem
and
the
tapajos
a
few
species
of
all
orders
however
are
found
here
which
occurred
nowhere
else
on
the
amazons
besides
several
others
which
are
properly
considered
local
varieties
or
races
of
others
found
at
para
on
the
northern
shore
of
the
amazons
or
in
other
parts
of
tropical
america
the
hymenoptera
were
especially
numerous
as
they
always
are
in
districts
which
possess
a
sandy
soil
but
the
many
interesting
facts
which
i
gleaned
relative
to
their
habits
will
be
more
conveniently
introduced
when
i
treat
of
the
same
or
similar
species
found
in
the
localities
in
the
broad
alleys
of
the
forest
several
species
of
morpho
were
common
one
of
these
is
a
sister
form
to
the
morpho
hecuba
which
i
have
mentioned
as
occurring
at
obydos
the
villa
nova
kind
differs
from
hecuba
sufficiently
to
be
considered
a
distinct
species
and
has
been
described
under
the
name
of
cisseis
but
it
is
clearly
only
a
local
variety
of
it
the
range
of
the
two
being
limited
by
the
barrier
of
the
broad
amazons
it
is
a
grand
sight
to
see
these
colossal
butterflies
by
twos
and
threes
floating
at
a
great
height
in
the
still
air
of
a
tropical
morning
they
flap
their
wings
only
at
long
intervals
for
i
have
noticed
them
to
sail
a
very
considerable
distance
without
a
stroke
their
and
the
thorax
to
which
they
are
attached
are
very
feeble
in
comparison
with
the
wide
extent
and
weight
of
the
wings
but
the
large
expanse
of
these
members
doubtless
assists
the
insects
in
maintaining
their
aerial
course
morphos
are
among
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
insect
denizens
of
tropical
american
forests
and
the
broad
glades
of
the
villa
nova
woods
seemed
especially
suited
to
them
for
i
noticed
here
six
species
the
largest
specimens
of
morpho
cisseis
measure
seven
inches
and
a
half
in
expanse
another
smaller
kind
which
i
could
not
capture
was
of
a
pale
colour
and
the
polished
surface
of
its
wings
flashed
like
a
silver
speculum
as
the
insect
flapped
its
wings
at
a
great
elevation
in
the
sunlight
to
resume
our
voyage
we
left
villa
nova
on
the
of
december
a
light
wind
on
the
carried
us
across
to
the
opposite
shore
and
past
the
mouth
of
the
do
arco
or
the
little
river
of
the
bow
on
account
of
its
being
a
short
arm
of
the
main
river
of
a
curved
shape
and
rejoining
the
amazons
a
little
below
villa
nova
on
the
after
passing
a
large
island
in
we
arrived
at
a
place
where
a
line
of
perpendicular
clay
cliffs
called
the
barreiros
de
cararaucu
diverts
slightly
the
course
of
the
main
stream
as
at
obydos
a
little
below
these
cliffs
were
a
few
settlers
houses
here
penna
remained
ten
days
to
trade
a
delay
which
i
turned
to
good
account
in
augmenting
very
considerably
my
collections
at
the
first
house
a
festival
was
going
forward
we
anchored
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
on
account
of
the
water
being
shoaly
and
early
in
the
morning
three
canoes
put
off
laden
with
salt
fish
oil
of
manatee
fowls
and
bananas
wares
which
the
owners
wished
to
exchange
for
different
articles
required
for
the
festa
soon
after
i
went
ashore
the
head
man
was
a
tall
made
civilised
tapuyo
named
marcellino
who
with
his
wife
a
thin
active
wiry
old
squaw
did
the
honours
of
their
house
i
thought
admirably
the
company
consisted
of
fifty
or
sixty
indians
and
mamelucos
some
of
them
knew
portuguese
but
the
tupi
language
was
the
only
one
used
amongst
themselves
the
festival
was
in
honour
of
our
lady
of
conception
and
when
the
people
learnt
that
penna
had
on
board
an
image
of
the
saint
handsomer
than
their
own
they
put
off
in
their
canoes
to
borrow
it
marcellino
taking
charge
of
the
doll
covering
it
carefully
with
a
white
towel
on
landing
with
the
image
a
procession
was
formed
from
the
port
to
the
house
and
salutes
fired
from
a
couple
of
lazarino
guns
the
saint
being
afterwards
carefully
deposited
in
the
family
oratorio
after
a
litany
and
hymn
were
sung
in
the
evening
all
assembled
to
supper
around
a
large
mat
spread
on
a
smooth
space
in
front
of
the
house
the
meal
consisted
of
a
large
boiled
pirarucu
which
had
been
harpooned
for
the
purpose
in
the
morning
stewed
and
roasted
turtle
piles
of
and
bananas
the
old
lady
with
two
young
girls
showed
the
greatest
activity
in
waiting
on
the
guests
marcellino
standing
gravely
by
observing
what
was
wanted
and
giving
the
necessary
orders
to
his
wife
when
all
was
done
hard
drinking
began
and
soon
after
there
was
a
dance
to
which
penna
and
i
were
invited
the
liquor
served
was
chiefly
a
spirit
distilled
by
the
people
themselves
from
mandioca
cakes
the
dances
were
all
of
the
same
class
namely
different
varieties
of
the
landum
an
erotic
dance
similar
to
the
fandango
originally
learned
from
the
portuguese
the
music
was
supplied
by
a
couple
of
guitars
played
alternately
by
the
young
men
all
passed
off
very
quietly
considering
the
amount
of
strong
liquor
drunk
and
the
ball
was
kept
up
until
sunrise
the
next
morning
we
visited
all
the
houses
one
after
the
other
one
of
them
was
situated
in
a
charming
spot
with
a
broad
sandy
beach
before
it
at
the
entrance
to
the
do
mucambo
a
channel
leading
to
an
interior
lake
peopled
by
savages
of
the
mura
tribe
this
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
an
industrious
family
but
all
the
men
were
absent
salting
pirarucu
on
the
lakes
the
house
like
its
neighbours
was
simply
a
framework
of
poles
thatched
with
leaves
the
walls
roughly
latticed
and
plastered
with
mud
but
it
was
larger
and
much
cleaner
inside
than
the
others
it
was
full
of
women
and
children
who
were
busy
all
day
with
their
various
employments
some
weaving
hammocks
in
a
large
clumsy
frame
which
held
the
warp
while
the
shuttle
was
passed
by
the
hand
slowly
across
the
six
foot
breadth
of
web
others
were
spinning
cotton
and
others
again
scraping
pressing
and
roasting
mandioca
the
family
had
cleared
and
cultivated
a
large
piece
of
ground
the
soil
was
of
extraordinary
richness
the
perpendicular
banks
of
the
river
near
the
house
revealing
a
depth
of
many
feet
of
crumbling
vegetable
mould
there
was
a
large
plantation
of
tobacco
besides
the
usual
patches
of
and
mandioca
and
a
grove
of
cotton
cacao
coffee
and
trees
surrounded
the
house
we
passed
two
nights
at
anchor
in
shoaly
water
off
the
beach
the
weather
was
most
beautiful
and
scores
of
dolphins
rolled
and
snorted
about
the
canoe
all
night
we
crossed
the
river
at
this
point
and
entered
a
narrow
channel
which
penetrates
the
interior
of
the
island
of
tupinambarana
and
leads
to
a
chain
of
lakes
called
the
lagos
de
cararaucu
a
furious
current
swept
along
the
coast
eating
into
the
crumbling
earthy
banks
and
strewing
the
river
with
debris
of
the
forest
the
mouth
of
the
channel
lies
about
miles
from
villa
nova
the
entrance
is
only
about
forty
yards
broad
but
it
expands
a
short
distance
inland
into
a
large
sheet
of
water
we
suffered
terribly
from
insect
pests
during
the
hours
we
remained
here
at
night
it
was
quite
impossible
to
sleep
for
mosquitoes
they
fell
upon
us
by
myriads
and
without
much
piping
came
straight
at
our
faces
as
thick
as
raindrops
in
a
shower
the
men
crowded
into
the
cabins
and
then
tried
to
expel
the
pests
by
the
smoke
from
burnt
rags
but
it
was
of
little
avail
although
we
were
half
suffocated
during
the
operation
in
the
daytime
the
motuca
a
much
larger
and
more
formidable
fly
than
the
mosquito
insisted
upon
levying
his
tax
of
blood
we
had
been
tormented
by
it
for
many
days
past
but
this
place
seemed
to
be
its
metropolis
the
species
has
been
described
by
perty
the
author
of
the
entomological
portion
of
spix
and
martius
travels
under
the
name
of
hadrus
lepidotus
it
is
a
member
of
the
tabanidae
family
and
indeed
is
closely
related
to
the
haematopota
pluvialis
a
brown
fly
which
haunts
the
borders
of
woods
in
summer
time
in
england
the
motuca
is
of
a
colour
its
proboscis
is
formed
of
a
bundle
of
horny
lancets
which
are
shorter
and
broader
than
is
usually
the
case
in
the
family
to
which
it
belongs
its
puncture
does
not
produce
much
pain
but
it
makes
such
a
large
gash
in
the
flesh
that
the
blood
trickles
forth
in
little
streams
many
scores
of
them
were
flying
about
the
canoe
all
day
and
sometimes
eight
or
ten
would
settle
on
one
ankles
at
the
same
time
it
is
sluggish
in
its
motions
and
may
be
easily
killed
with
the
fingers
when
it
settles
penna
went
forward
in
the
montaria
to
the
pirarucu
fishing
stations
on
a
lake
lying
further
inland
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
reaching
them
on
account
of
the
length
and
intricacy
of
the
channels
so
after
wasting
a
day
during
which
however
i
had
a
profitable
ramble
in
the
forest
we
again
crossed
the
river
and
on
the
continued
our
voyage
along
the
northern
shore
the
clay
cliffs
of
cararaucu
are
several
miles
in
length
the
hard
pink
and
red
coloured
beds
are
here
extremely
thick
and
in
some
places
present
a
compact
stony
texture
the
total
height
of
the
cliff
is
from
thirty
to
sixty
feet
above
the
mean
level
of
the
river
and
the
clay
rests
on
strata
of
the
same
coarse
cemented
conglomerate
which
has
already
been
so
often
mentioned
large
blocks
of
this
latter
have
been
detached
and
rolled
by
the
force
of
currents
up
parts
of
the
cliff
where
they
are
seen
resting
on
terraces
of
the
clay
on
the
top
of
all
lies
a
bed
of
sand
and
vegetable
mold
which
supports
a
lofty
forest
growing
up
to
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
after
passing
these
barreiros
we
continued
our
way
along
a
low
uninhabited
coast
clothed
wherever
it
was
elevated
above
mark
with
the
usual
forests
of
the
higher
ygapo
lands
to
which
the
broad
and
regular
fronds
of
the
murumuru
palm
here
extremely
abundant
served
as
a
great
decoration
wherever
the
land
was
lower
than
the
flood
height
of
the
amazons
cecropia
trees
prevailed
sometimes
scattered
over
meadows
of
tall
leaved
grasses
which
surrounded
shallow
pools
swarming
with
alligators
were
common
on
most
parts
of
the
coast
in
some
places
we
also
saw
small
herds
of
capybaras
a
large
rodent
animal
like
a
colossal
among
the
rank
herbage
on
muddy
banks
and
now
and
then
flocks
of
the
graceful
squirrel
monkey
chrysothrix
sciureus
while
the
vivacious
caiarara
cebus
albifrons
were
seen
taking
flying
leaps
from
tree
to
tree
on
the
we
passed
the
mouth
of
the
most
easterly
of
the
numerous
channels
which
lead
to
the
large
interior
lake
of
saraca
and
on
the
threaded
a
series
of
passages
between
islands
where
we
again
saw
human
habitations
ninety
miles
distant
from
the
last
house
at
cararaucu
on
the
we
arrived
at
serpa
serpa
is
a
small
village
consisting
of
about
eighty
houses
built
on
a
bank
elevated
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
the
beds
of
tabatinga
clay
which
are
here
intermingled
with
conglomerate
are
in
some
parts
of
the
declivity
prettily
variegated
in
colour
the
name
of
the
town
in
the
tupi
language
takes
its
origin
from
this
circumstance
signifying
striped
or
painted
rock
it
is
an
old
settlement
and
was
once
the
seat
of
the
district
government
which
had
authority
over
the
barra
of
the
rio
negro
it
was
in
a
village
but
it
has
since
revived
on
account
of
having
been
chosen
by
the
steamboat
company
of
the
amazons
as
a
station
for
steam
and
tile
manufactories
we
arrived
on
christmas
eve
when
the
village
presented
an
animated
appearance
from
the
number
of
people
congregated
for
the
holidays
the
port
was
full
of
canoes
large
and
small
from
the
montaria
with
its
arched
awning
of
woven
lianas
and
maranta
leaves
to
the
cuberta
of
the
peddling
trader
who
had
resorted
to
the
place
in
the
hope
of
trafficking
with
settlers
coming
from
remote
sitios
to
attend
the
festival
we
anchored
close
to
an
igarite
whose
owner
was
an
old
juri
indian
disfigured
by
a
large
black
tatooed
patch
in
the
middle
of
his
face
and
by
his
hair
being
close
cropped
except
a
fringe
in
front
of
the
head
in
the
afternoon
we
went
ashore
the
population
seemed
to
consist
chiefly
of
indians
living
as
usual
in
finished
mud
hovels
the
streets
were
irregularly
laid
out
and
overrun
with
weeds
and
bushes
swarming
with
mocuim
a
very
minute
scarlet
acarus
which
sweeps
off
to
one
clothes
in
passing
and
attaching
itself
in
great
numbers
to
the
skin
causes
a
most
disagreeable
itching
the
few
whites
and
better
class
of
mameluco
residents
live
in
more
substantial
dwellings
washed
and
tiled
all
both
men
and
women
seemed
to
me
much
more
cordial
and
at
the
same
time
more
brusque
in
their
manners
than
any
brazilians
i
had
yet
met
with
one
of
them
captain
manoel
joaquim
i
knew
for
a
long
time
afterwards
a
lively
intelligent
and
thoroughly
man
who
had
quite
a
reputation
throughout
the
interior
of
the
country
for
generosity
and
for
being
a
firm
friend
of
foreign
residents
and
stray
travellers
some
of
these
excellent
people
were
men
of
substance
being
owners
of
trading
vessels
slaves
and
extensive
plantations
of
cacao
and
tobacco
we
stayed
at
serpa
five
days
some
of
the
ceremonies
observed
at
christmas
were
interesting
inasmuch
as
they
were
the
same
with
little
modification
as
those
taught
by
the
jesuit
missionaries
more
than
a
century
ago
to
the
aboriginal
tribes
whom
they
had
induced
to
settle
on
this
spot
in
the
morning
all
the
women
and
girls
dressed
in
white
gauze
chemises
and
showy
calico
print
petticoats
went
in
procession
to
church
first
going
the
round
of
the
town
to
take
up
the
different
mordomos
or
stewards
whose
office
is
to
assist
the
juiz
of
the
festa
these
stewards
carried
each
a
long
white
reed
decorated
with
coloured
ribbons
several
children
also
accompanied
grotesquely
decked
with
finery
three
old
squaws
went
in
front
holding
the
saire
a
large
frame
clothed
with
cotton
and
studded
with
ornaments
bits
of
and
so
forth
this
they
danced
up
and
down
singing
all
the
time
a
monotonous
whining
hymn
in
the
tupi
language
and
at
frequent
intervals
turning
round
to
face
the
followers
who
then
all
stopped
for
a
few
moments
i
was
told
that
this
saire
was
a
device
adopted
by
the
jesuits
to
attract
the
savages
to
church
for
these
everywhere
followed
the
mirrors
in
which
they
saw
as
it
were
magically
reflected
their
own
persons
in
the
evening
revelry
prevailed
on
all
sides
the
negroes
who
had
a
saint
of
their
own
colour
benedito
had
their
holiday
apart
from
the
rest
and
spent
the
whole
night
singing
and
dancing
to
the
music
of
a
long
drum
gamba
and
the
caracasha
the
drum
was
a
hollow
log
having
one
end
covered
with
skin
and
was
played
by
the
performer
sitting
astride
upon
it
and
drumming
with
his
knuckles
the
caracasha
is
a
notched
bamboo
tube
which
produces
a
harsh
rattling
noise
by
passing
a
hard
stick
over
the
notches
nothing
could
exceed
in
dreary
monotony
this
music
and
the
singing
and
dancing
which
were
kept
up
with
unflagging
vigour
all
night
long
the
indians
did
not
get
up
a
dance
for
the
whites
and
mamelucos
had
monopolised
all
the
pretty
coloured
girls
for
their
own
ball
and
the
older
squaws
preferred
looking
on
to
taking
a
part
themselves
some
of
their
husbands
joined
the
negroes
and
got
drunk
very
quickly
it
was
amusing
to
notice
how
voluble
the
usually
taciturn
redskins
became
under
the
influence
of
liquor
the
negroes
and
indians
excused
their
own
intemperance
by
saying
the
whites
were
getting
drunk
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
which
was
quite
true
we
left
serpa
on
the
of
december
in
company
of
an
old
planter
named
senor
joao
john
trinidade
at
whose
sitio
situated
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
madeira
penna
intended
to
spend
a
few
days
our
course
on
the
and
lay
through
narrow
channels
between
islands
on
the
we
passed
the
last
of
these
and
then
beheld
to
the
south
a
expanse
of
water
where
the
madeira
the
greatest
tributary
of
the
amazons
after
miles
of
course
blends
its
waters
with
those
of
the
king
of
rivers
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
a
junction
of
waters
on
so
vast
a
scale
as
this
now
nearly
miles
from
the
sea
while
travelling
week
after
week
along
the
somewhat
monotonous
stream
often
hemmed
in
between
islands
and
becoming
thoroughly
familiar
with
it
my
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
this
vast
water
system
had
become
gradually
deadened
but
this
noble
sight
renewed
the
first
feelings
of
wonder
one
is
inclined
in
such
places
as
these
to
think
the
paraenses
do
not
exaggerate
much
when
they
call
the
amazons
the
mediterranean
of
south
america
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
madeira
the
amazons
sweeps
down
in
a
majestic
reach
to
all
appearance
not
a
whit
less
in
breadth
before
than
after
this
enormous
addition
to
its
waters
the
madeira
does
not
ebb
and
flow
simultaneously
with
the
amazons
it
rises
and
sinks
about
two
months
earlier
so
that
it
was
now
fuller
than
the
main
river
its
current
therefore
poured
forth
freely
from
its
mouth
carrying
with
it
a
long
line
of
floating
trees
and
patches
of
grass
which
had
been
torn
from
its
crumbly
banks
in
the
lower
part
of
its
course
the
current
however
did
not
reach
the
middle
of
the
main
stream
but
swept
along
nearer
to
the
southern
shore
a
few
items
of
information
which
i
gleaned
relative
to
this
river
may
find
a
place
here
the
madeira
is
navigable
for
about
miles
from
its
mouth
a
series
of
cataracts
and
rapids
then
commences
which
extends
with
some
intervals
of
quiet
water
about
miles
beyond
which
is
another
long
stretch
of
navigable
stream
canoes
sometimes
descend
from
villa
bella
in
the
interior
province
of
matto
grosso
but
not
so
frequently
as
formerly
and
i
could
hear
of
very
few
persons
who
had
attempted
of
late
years
to
ascend
the
river
to
that
point
it
was
explored
by
the
portuguese
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
chief
and
now
the
only
town
on
its
banks
borba
miles
from
its
mouth
being
founded
in
up
to
the
year
the
lower
part
of
the
river
as
far
as
about
a
hundred
miles
beyond
borba
was
regularly
visited
by
traders
from
villa
nova
serpa
and
barra
to
collect
sarsaparilla
copauba
balsam
and
to
trade
with
the
indians
with
whom
their
relations
were
generally
on
a
friendly
footing
in
that
year
many
collectors
resorted
to
this
region
stimulated
by
the
high
price
a
pound
which
the
article
was
at
that
time
fetching
at
para
and
then
the
araras
a
fierce
and
intractable
tribe
of
indians
began
to
be
troublesome
they
attacked
several
canoes
and
massacred
everyone
on
board
the
indian
crews
as
well
as
the
white
traders
their
plan
was
to
lurk
in
ambush
near
the
sandy
beaches
where
canoes
stop
for
the
night
and
then
fall
upon
the
people
while
asleep
sometimes
they
came
under
pretence
of
wishing
to
trade
and
then
as
soon
as
they
could
get
the
trader
at
a
disadvantage
shot
him
and
his
crew
from
behind
trees
their
arms
were
clubs
bows
and
taquara
arrows
the
latter
a
formidable
weapon
tipped
with
a
piece
of
flinty
bamboo
shaped
like
a
they
could
propel
it
with
such
force
as
to
pierce
a
man
completely
through
the
body
the
whites
of
borba
made
reprisals
inducing
the
warlike
mundurucus
who
had
an
old
feud
with
the
araras
to
assist
them
this
state
of
things
lasted
two
or
three
years
and
made
a
journey
up
the
madeira
a
risky
undertaking
as
the
savages
attacked
all
corners
besides
the
araras
and
the
mundurucus
the
latter
a
tribe
friendly
to
the
whites
attached
to
agriculture
and
inhabiting
the
interior
of
the
country
from
the
madeira
to
beyond
the
tapajos
two
other
tribes
of
indians
now
inhabit
the
lower
madeira
namely
the
parentintins
and
the
muras
of
the
former
i
did
not
hear
much
the
muras
lead
a
lazy
quiet
life
on
the
banks
of
the
labyrinths
of
lakes
and
channels
which
intersect
the
low
country
on
both
sides
of
the
river
below
borba
the
araras
are
one
of
those
tribes
which
do
not
plant
mandioca
and
indeed
have
no
settled
habitations
they
are
very
similar
in
stature
and
other
physical
features
to
the
mundurucus
although
differing
from
them
so
widely
in
habits
and
social
condition
they
paint
their
chins
red
with
urucu
anatto
and
have
usually
a
black
tattooed
streak
on
each
side
of
the
face
running
from
the
corner
of
the
mouth
to
the
temple
they
have
not
yet
learned
the
use
of
firearms
have
no
canoes
and
spend
their
lives
roaming
over
the
interior
of
the
country
living
on
game
and
wild
fruits
when
they
wish
to
cross
a
river
they
make
a
temporary
canoe
with
the
thick
bark
of
trees
which
they
secure
in
the
required
shape
of
a
boat
by
means
of
lianas
i
heard
it
stated
by
a
trader
of
santarem
who
narrowly
escaped
being
butchered
by
them
in
that
the
araras
numbered
fighting
men
the
number
i
think
must
be
exaggerated
as
it
generally
is
with
regard
to
brazilian
tribes
when
the
indians
show
a
hostile
disposition
to
the
whites
i
believe
it
is
most
frequently
owing
to
some
provocation
they
have
received
at
their
hands
for
the
first
impulse
of
the
brazilian
is
to
respect
europeans
they
have
a
strong
dislike
to
be
forced
into
their
service
but
if
strangers
visit
them
with
a
friendly
intention
they
are
well
treated
it
is
related
however
that
the
indians
of
the
madeira
were
hostile
to
the
portuguese
from
the
first
it
was
then
the
tribes
of
muras
and
torazes
who
attacked
travellers
in
i
met
with
an
american
an
odd
character
named
kemp
who
had
lived
for
many
years
amongst
the
indians
on
the
madeira
near
the
abandoned
settlement
of
crato
he
told
me
his
neighbours
were
a
and
cheerful
people
and
that
the
onslaught
of
the
araras
was
provoked
by
a
trader
from
bara
who
wantonly
fired
into
a
family
of
them
killing
the
parents
and
carrying
off
their
children
to
be
employed
as
domestic
servants
we
remained
nine
days
at
the
sitio
of
senor
john
trinidade
it
is
situated
on
a
tract
of
high
ygapo
land
which
is
raised
however
only
a
few
inches
above
mark
this
skirts
the
northern
shore
for
a
long
distance
the
soil
consisting
of
alluvium
and
rich
vegetable
mould
and
exhibiting
the
most
exuberant
fertility
such
districts
are
the
first
to
be
settled
on
in
this
country
and
the
whole
coast
for
many
miles
was
dotted
with
sitios
like
that
of
our
friend
the
establishment
was
a
large
one
the
house
and
covering
a
large
space
of
ground
the
industrious
proprietor
seemed
to
be
he
was
planter
trader
fisherman
and
and
a
large
igarite
was
now
on
the
stocks
under
a
large
shed
there
was
great
pleasure
in
contemplating
this
prosperous
farm
from
its
being
worked
almost
entirely
by
free
labour
in
fact
by
one
family
and
its
dependents
john
trinidade
had
only
one
female
slave
his
other
workpeople
were
a
brother
and
two
godsons
a
free
negro
one
or
two
indians
and
a
family
of
muras
both
he
and
his
wife
were
mamelucos
the
negro
children
called
them
always
father
and
mother
the
order
abundance
and
comfort
about
the
place
showed
what
industry
and
good
management
could
effect
in
this
country
without
but
the
surplus
produce
of
such
small
plantations
is
very
trifling
all
we
saw
had
been
done
since
the
disorders
of
during
which
john
trinidade
was
a
great
sufferer
he
was
obliged
to
fly
and
the
mura
indians
destroyed
his
house
and
plantations
there
was
a
large
weeded
grove
of
cacao
along
the
banks
of
the
river
comprising
about
trees
and
further
inland
considerable
plantations
of
tobacco
mandioca
indian
corn
fields
of
rice
melons
and
watermelons
near
the
house
was
a
kitchen
garden
in
which
grew
cabbages
and
onions
introduced
from
europe
besides
a
wonderful
variety
of
tropical
vegetables
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
these
plantations
and
gardens
were
enclosed
or
neatly
kept
such
is
never
the
case
in
this
country
where
labour
is
so
scarce
but
it
was
an
unusual
thing
to
see
vegetables
grown
at
all
and
the
ground
tolerably
well
weeded
the
space
around
the
house
was
plentifully
planted
with
some
belonging
to
the
anonaceous
order
yielding
delicious
fruits
large
as
a
head
and
full
of
custardy
pulp
which
it
is
necessary
to
eat
with
a
spoon
besides
oranges
lemons
guavas
alligator
pears
abius
achras
cainito
genipapas
and
bananas
in
the
shade
of
these
coffee
trees
grew
in
great
luxuriance
the
table
was
always
well
supplied
with
fish
which
the
mura
who
was
attached
to
the
household
as
fisherman
caught
every
morning
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
port
the
chief
kinds
were
the
surubim
and
piramutaba
three
species
of
siluridae
belonging
to
the
genus
pimelodus
to
these
we
used
a
sauce
in
the
form
of
a
yellow
paste
quite
new
to
me
called
arube
which
is
made
of
the
poisonous
juice
of
the
mandioca
root
boiled
down
before
the
starch
or
tapioca
is
precipitated
and
seasoned
with
capsicum
peppers
it
is
kept
in
stone
bottles
several
weeks
before
using
and
is
a
most
appetising
relish
to
fish
tucupi
another
sauce
made
also
from
mandioca
juice
is
much
more
common
in
the
interior
of
the
country
than
arube
this
is
made
by
boiling
or
heating
the
pure
liquid
after
the
tapioca
has
been
separated
daily
for
several
days
in
succession
and
seasoning
it
with
peppers
and
small
fishes
when
old
it
has
the
taste
of
essence
of
anchovies
it
is
generally
made
as
a
liquid
but
the
juri
and
miranha
tribes
on
the
japura
make
it
up
in
the
form
of
a
black
paste
by
a
mode
of
preparation
i
could
not
learn
it
is
then
called
or
black
tucupi
i
have
seen
the
indians
on
the
tapajos
where
fish
is
scarce
season
tucupi
with
sauba
ants
it
is
there
used
chiefly
as
a
sauce
to
tacaca
another
preparation
from
mandioca
consisting
of
the
starch
beaten
up
in
boiling
water
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
nine
days
we
spent
at
this
place
our
host
and
hostess
took
an
interest
in
my
pursuit
one
of
the
best
chambers
in
the
house
was
given
up
to
me
and
the
young
men
took
me
on
long
rambles
in
the
neighbouring
forests
i
saw
very
little
hard
work
going
forward
everyone
rose
with
the
daw
and
went
down
to
the
river
to
bathe
then
came
the
cup
of
rich
and
strong
coffee
after
which
all
proceeded
to
their
avocations
at
this
time
nothing
was
being
done
at
the
plantations
the
cacao
and
tobacco
crops
were
not
ripe
weeding
time
was
over
and
the
only
work
on
foot
was
the
preparation
of
a
little
farinha
by
the
women
the
men
dawdled
about
went
shooting
and
fishing
or
did
trifling
jobs
about
the
house
the
only
laborious
work
done
during
the
year
in
these
establishments
is
the
felling
of
timber
for
new
clearings
this
happens
at
the
beginning
of
the
dry
season
namely
from
july
to
september
whatever
employment
the
people
were
engaged
in
they
did
not
intermit
it
during
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
those
who
went
into
the
woods
took
their
dinners
with
them
a
small
bag
of
farinha
and
a
slice
of
salt
fish
about
sunset
all
returned
to
the
house
they
then
had
their
frugal
suppers
and
towards
eight
after
coming
to
ask
a
blessing
of
the
patriarchal
head
of
the
household
went
off
to
their
hammocks
to
sleep
there
was
another
visitor
besides
ourselves
a
negro
whom
john
trinidade
introduced
to
me
as
his
oldest
and
dearest
friend
who
had
saved
his
life
during
the
revolt
of
i
have
unfortunately
forgotten
his
name
he
was
a
freeman
and
had
a
sitio
of
his
own
situated
about
a
day
journey
from
this
there
was
the
same
manly
bearing
about
him
that
i
had
noticed
with
pleasure
in
many
other
free
negroes
but
his
quiet
earnest
manner
and
the
thoughtful
and
benevolent
expression
of
his
countenance
showed
him
to
be
a
superior
man
of
his
class
he
told
me
he
had
been
intimate
with
our
host
for
thirty
years
and
that
a
wry
word
had
never
passed
between
them
at
the
commencement
of
the
disorders
of
he
got
into
the
secret
of
a
plot
for
assassinating
his
friend
hatched
by
some
villains
whose
only
cause
of
enmity
was
their
owing
him
money
and
envying
his
prosperity
it
was
such
as
these
who
aroused
the
stupid
and
brutal
animosity
of
the
muras
against
the
whites
the
negro
on
obtaining
this
news
set
off
alone
in
a
montaria
on
a
six
hour
journey
in
the
dead
of
night
to
warn
his
compadre
of
the
fate
in
store
for
him
and
thus
gave
him
time
to
fly
it
was
a
pleasing
sight
to
notice
the
cordiality
of
feeling
and
respect
for
each
other
shown
by
these
two
old
men
for
they
used
to
spend
hours
together
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
seated
under
a
shed
which
overlooked
the
broad
river
and
talking
of
old
times
john
trinidade
was
famous
for
his
tobacco
and
cigarettes
as
he
took
great
pains
in
preparing
the
tauari
or
envelope
which
is
formed
of
the
inner
bark
of
a
tree
separated
into
thin
papery
layers
many
trees
yield
it
among
them
the
courataria
guianensis
and
the
sapucaya
both
belonging
to
the
same
natural
order
the
bark
is
cut
into
long
strips
of
a
breadth
suitable
for
folding
the
tobacco
the
inner
portion
is
then
separated
boiled
hammered
with
a
wooden
mallet
and
exposed
to
the
air
for
a
few
hours
some
kinds
have
a
reddish
colour
and
an
astringent
taste
but
the
sort
prepared
by
our
host
was
of
a
beautiful
hue
and
perfectly
tasteless
he
obtained
sixty
eighty
and
sometimes
a
hundred
layers
from
the
same
strip
of
bark
the
best
tobacco
in
brazil
is
grown
in
the
neighbourhood
of
borba
on
the
madeira
where
the
soil
is
a
rich
black
loam
but
tobacco
of
very
good
quality
was
grown
by
john
trinidade
and
his
neighbours
along
this
coast
on
similar
soil
it
is
made
up
into
slender
rolls
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diameter
and
six
feet
in
length
tapering
at
each
end
when
the
leaves
are
gathered
and
partially
dried
layers
of
them
after
the
are
plucked
out
are
placed
on
a
mat
and
rolled
up
into
the
required
shape
this
is
done
by
the
women
and
children
who
also
manage
the
planting
weeding
and
gathering
of
the
tobacco
the
process
of
tightening
the
rolls
is
a
long
and
heavy
task
and
can
be
done
only
by
men
the
cords
used
for
this
purpose
are
of
very
great
strength
they
are
made
of
the
inner
bark
of
a
peculiar
wooded
and
slender
tree
called
uaissima
which
yields
when
beaten
out
a
great
quantity
of
most
beautiful
silky
fibre
many
feet
in
length
i
think
this
might
be
turned
to
some
use
by
english
manufacturers
if
they
could
obtain
it
in
large
quantity
the
tree
is
abundant
on
light
soils
on
the
southern
side
of
the
lower
amazons
and
grows
very
rapidly
when
the
rolls
are
sufficiently
well
pressed
they
are
bound
round
with
narrow
thongs
of
remarkable
toughness
cut
from
the
bark
of
the
climbing
jacitara
palm
tree
desmoncus
macracanthus
and
are
then
ready
for
sale
or
use
it
was
very
pleasant
to
roam
in
our
host
cacaoal
the
ground
was
clear
of
underwood
the
trees
were
about
thirty
feet
in
height
and
formed
a
dense
shade
two
species
of
monkey
frequented
the
trees
and
i
was
told
committed
great
depredations
when
the
fruit
was
ripe
one
of
these
the
macaco
prego
cebus
cirrhifer
is
a
most
impudent
thief
it
destroys
more
than
it
eats
by
its
random
hasty
way
of
plucking
and
breaking
the
fruits
and
when
about
to
return
to
the
forest
carries
away
all
it
can
in
its
hands
or
under
its
arms
the
other
species
the
pretty
little
chrysothrix
sciureus
contents
itself
with
devouring
what
it
can
on
the
spot
a
variety
of
beautiful
insects
basked
on
the
foliage
where
stray
gleams
of
sunlight
glanced
through
the
canopy
of
broad
leaves
and
numbers
of
an
elegant
tiger
beetle
odontocheila
egregia
ran
and
flew
about
over
the
herbage
we
left
this
place
on
the
of
january
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
arrived
at
matari
a
miserable
little
settlement
of
mura
indians
here
we
again
anchored
and
went
ashore
the
place
consisted
of
about
twenty
and
had
a
most
forlorn
appearance
notwithstanding
the
luxuriant
forest
in
its
rear
a
horde
of
these
indians
settled
here
many
years
ago
on
the
site
of
an
abandoned
missionary
station
and
the
government
had
lately
placed
a
resident
director
over
them
with
the
intention
of
bringing
the
hitherto
intractable
savages
under
authority
this
however
seemed
to
promise
no
other
result
than
that
of
driving
them
to
their
old
solitary
haunts
on
the
banks
of
the
interior
waters
for
many
families
had
already
withdrawn
themselves
the
absence
of
the
usual
cultivated
trees
and
plants
gave
the
place
a
naked
and
aspect
i
entered
one
of
the
hovels
where
several
women
were
employed
cooking
a
meal
portions
of
a
large
fish
were
roasting
over
a
fire
made
in
the
middle
of
the
low
chamber
and
the
entrails
were
scattered
about
the
floor
on
which
the
women
with
their
children
were
squatted
these
had
a
timid
distrustful
expression
of
countenance
and
their
bodies
were
begrimed
with
black
mud
which
is
smeared
over
the
skin
as
a
protection
against
mosquitoes
the
children
were
naked
the
women
wore
petticoats
of
coarse
cloth
ragged
round
the
edges
and
stained
in
blotches
with
murixi
a
dye
made
from
the
bark
of
a
tree
one
of
them
wore
a
necklace
of
teeth
there
were
scarcely
any
household
utensils
the
place
was
bare
with
the
exception
of
two
dirty
grass
hammocks
hung
in
the
corners
i
missed
the
usual
mandioca
sheds
behind
the
house
with
their
surrounding
cotton
cacao
coffee
and
lemon
trees
two
or
three
young
men
of
the
tribe
were
lounging
about
the
low
open
doorway
they
were
fellows
but
less
proportioned
than
the
indians
of
the
lower
amazons
generally
are
their
breadth
of
chest
was
remarkable
and
their
arms
were
wonderfully
thick
and
muscular
the
legs
appeared
short
in
proportion
to
the
trunk
the
expression
of
their
countenances
was
unmistakably
more
sullen
and
brutal
and
the
skin
of
a
darker
hue
than
is
common
in
the
brazilian
red
man
before
we
left
the
hut
an
old
couple
came
in
the
husband
carrying
his
paddle
bow
arrows
and
harpoon
the
woman
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
a
large
basket
filled
with
palm
fruits
the
man
was
of
low
stature
and
had
a
wild
appearance
from
the
long
coarse
hair
which
hung
over
his
forehead
both
his
lips
were
pierced
with
holes
as
is
usual
with
the
older
muras
seen
on
the
river
they
used
formerly
to
wear
tusks
of
the
wild
hog
in
these
holes
whenever
they
went
out
to
encounter
strangers
or
their
enemies
in
war
the
gloomy
savagery
filth
and
poverty
of
the
people
in
this
place
made
me
feel
quite
melancholy
and
i
was
glad
to
return
to
the
canoe
they
offered
us
no
civilities
they
did
not
even
pass
the
ordinary
salutes
which
all
the
and
many
savage
indians
proffer
on
a
first
meeting
the
men
persecuted
penna
for
cashaca
which
they
seemed
to
consider
the
only
good
thing
the
white
man
brings
with
him
as
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
give
in
exchange
penna
declined
to
supply
them
they
followed
us
as
we
descended
to
the
port
becoming
very
troublesome
when
about
a
dozen
had
collected
together
they
brought
their
empty
bottles
with
them
and
promised
fish
and
turtle
if
we
would
only
trust
them
first
with
the
coveted
aguardente
or
as
they
called
it
penna
was
inexorable
he
ordered
the
crew
to
weigh
anchor
and
the
disappointed
savages
remained
hooting
after
us
with
all
their
might
from
the
top
of
the
bank
as
we
glided
away
the
muras
have
a
bad
reputation
all
over
this
part
of
the
amazons
the
indians
being
quite
as
severe
upon
them
as
the
white
settlers
everyone
spoke
of
them
as
lazy
thievish
untrustworthy
and
cruel
they
have
a
greater
repugnance
than
any
other
class
of
indians
to
settled
habits
regular
labour
and
the
service
of
the
whites
their
distaste
in
fact
to
any
approximation
towards
civilised
life
is
invincible
yet
most
of
these
faults
are
only
an
exaggeration
of
the
fundamental
defects
of
character
in
the
brazilian
red
man
there
is
nothing
i
think
to
show
that
the
muras
had
a
different
origin
from
the
nobler
agricultural
tribes
belonging
to
the
tupi
nation
to
some
of
whom
they
are
close
neighbours
although
the
very
striking
contrast
in
their
characters
and
habits
would
suggest
the
conclusion
that
their
origin
had
been
different
in
the
same
way
as
the
semangs
of
malacca
for
instance
with
regard
to
the
malays
they
are
merely
an
offshoot
from
them
a
number
of
segregated
hordes
becoming
degraded
by
a
residence
most
likely
of
very
many
centuries
in
ygapo
lands
confined
to
a
fish
diet
and
obliged
to
wander
constantly
in
search
of
food
those
tribes
which
are
supposed
to
be
more
nearly
related
to
the
tupis
are
distinguished
by
their
settled
agricultural
habits
their
living
in
houses
their
practice
of
many
arts
such
as
the
manufacture
of
painted
earthenware
weaving
and
their
general
custom
of
tattooing
social
organisation
obedience
to
chiefs
and
so
forth
the
muras
have
become
a
nation
of
nomade
fishermen
ignorant
of
agriculture
and
all
other
arts
practised
by
their
neighbours
they
do
not
build
substantial
and
fixed
dwellings
but
live
in
separate
families
or
small
hordes
wandering
from
place
to
place
along
the
margins
of
those
rivers
and
lakes
which
most
abound
in
fish
and
turtle
at
each
place
they
construct
temporary
huts
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
shifting
them
higher
or
lower
on
the
banks
as
the
waters
advance
or
recede
their
canoes
originally
were
made
simply
of
the
thick
bark
of
trees
bound
up
into
a
shape
by
means
of
woody
lianas
these
are
now
rarely
seen
as
most
families
possess
montarias
which
they
have
contrived
to
steal
from
the
settlers
from
time
to
time
their
food
is
chiefly
fish
and
turtle
which
they
are
very
expert
in
capturing
it
is
said
by
their
neighbours
that
they
dive
after
turtles
and
succeed
in
catching
them
by
the
legs
which
i
believe
is
true
in
the
shallow
lakes
where
turtles
are
imprisoned
in
the
dry
season
they
shoot
fish
with
bow
and
arrow
and
have
no
notion
of
any
other
method
of
cooking
it
than
by
roasting
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
the
whole
tribe
were
originally
quite
ignorant
of
agriculture
as
some
families
on
the
banks
of
the
streams
behind
villa
nova
who
could
scarcely
have
acquired
the
art
in
recent
times
plant
mandioca
but
as
a
general
rule
the
only
vegetable
food
used
by
the
muras
is
bananas
and
wild
fruits
the
original
home
of
this
tribe
was
the
banks
of
the
lower
madeira
it
appears
they
were
hostile
to
the
european
settlers
from
the
beginning
plundering
their
sitios
waylaying
their
canoes
and
massacring
all
who
fell
into
their
power
about
fifty
years
ago
the
portuguese
succeeded
in
turning
the
warlike
propensities
of
the
mundurucus
against
them
and
these
in
the
course
of
many
years
persecution
greatly
weakened
the
power
of
the
tribe
and
drove
a
great
part
of
them
from
their
seats
on
the
banks
of
the
madeira
the
muras
are
now
scattered
in
single
hordes
and
families
over
a
wide
extent
of
country
bordering
the
main
river
from
villa
nova
to
catua
near
ega
a
distance
of
miles
since
the
disorders
of
when
they
committed
great
havoc
amongst
the
peaceable
settlements
from
santarem
to
the
rio
negro
and
were
pursued
and
slaughtered
in
great
numbers
by
the
mundurucus
in
alliance
with
the
brazilians
they
have
given
no
serious
trouble
there
is
one
curious
custom
of
the
muras
which
requires
noticing
before
concluding
this
digression
this
is
the
practice
of
taking
with
peculiar
ceremonies
the
snuff
is
called
parica
and
is
a
highly
stimulating
powder
made
from
the
seeds
of
a
species
of
inga
belonging
to
the
leguminous
order
of
plants
the
seeds
are
dried
in
the
sun
pounded
in
wooden
mortars
and
kept
in
bamboo
tubes
when
they
are
ripe
and
the
season
sets
in
they
have
a
lasting
many
days
which
the
brazilians
call
a
quarentena
and
which
forms
a
kind
of
festival
of
a
character
they
begin
by
drinking
large
quantities
of
caysuma
and
cashiri
fermented
drinks
made
of
various
fruits
and
mandioca
but
they
prefer
cashaca
or
rum
when
they
can
get
it
in
a
short
time
they
drink
themselves
into
a
soddened
state
and
then
commence
taking
the
parica
for
this
purpose
they
pair
off
and
each
of
the
partners
taking
a
reed
containing
a
quantity
of
the
snuff
after
going
through
a
deal
of
unintelligible
mummery
blows
the
contents
with
all
his
force
into
the
nostrils
of
his
companion
the
effect
on
the
usually
dull
and
taciturn
savages
is
wonderful
they
become
exceedingly
talkative
sing
shout
and
leap
about
in
the
wildest
excitement
a
reaction
soon
follows
more
drinking
is
then
necessary
to
rouse
them
from
their
stupor
and
thus
they
carry
on
for
many
days
in
succession
the
mauhes
also
use
the
parica
although
it
is
not
known
among
their
neighbours
the
mundurucus
their
manner
of
taking
it
is
very
different
from
that
of
the
swinish
muras
it
being
kept
in
the
form
of
a
paste
and
employed
chiefly
as
a
preventive
against
ague
in
the
months
between
the
dry
and
wet
seasons
when
the
disease
prevails
when
a
dose
is
required
a
small
quantity
of
the
paste
is
dried
and
pulverised
on
a
flat
shell
and
the
powder
then
drawn
up
into
both
nostrils
at
once
through
two
vulture
quills
secured
together
by
cotton
thread
the
use
of
parica
was
found
by
the
early
travellers
amongst
the
omaguas
a
section
of
the
tupis
who
formerly
lived
on
the
upper
amazons
a
thousand
miles
distant
from
the
homes
of
the
mauhes
and
muras
this
community
of
habits
is
one
of
those
facts
which
support
the
view
of
the
common
origin
and
near
relationship
of
the
amazonian
indians
after
leaving
matari
we
continued
our
voyage
along
the
northern
shore
the
banks
of
the
river
were
of
moderate
elevation
during
several
days
journey
the
terra
firma
lying
far
in
the
interior
and
the
coast
being
either
lowland
or
masked
with
islands
of
alluvial
formation
on
the
we
passed
the
upper
mouth
of
the
de
eva
an
arm
of
the
river
of
small
breadth
formed
by
a
straggling
island
some
ten
miles
in
length
lying
parallel
to
the
northern
bank
on
passing
the
western
end
of
this
the
main
land
again
appeared
a
rather
high
rocky
coast
clothed
with
a
magnificent
forest
of
rounded
outline
which
continues
hence
for
twenty
miles
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
and
forms
the
eastern
shore
of
that
river
many
houses
of
settlers
built
at
a
considerable
elevation
on
the
wooded
heights
now
enlivened
the
riverbanks
one
of
the
first
objects
which
greeted
us
here
was
a
beautiful
bird
we
had
not
hitherto
met
with
namely
the
scarlet
and
black
tanager
ramphoccelus
nigrogularis
flocks
of
which
were
seen
sporting
about
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
the
water
their
liveries
lighting
up
the
masses
of
green
foliage
the
weather
from
the
to
the
was
wretched
it
rained
sometimes
for
twelve
hours
in
succession
not
heavily
but
in
a
steady
drizzle
such
as
we
are
familiar
with
in
our
english
climate
we
landed
at
several
places
on
the
coast
penna
to
trade
as
usual
and
i
to
ramble
in
the
forest
in
search
of
birds
and
insects
in
one
spot
the
wooded
slope
enclosed
a
very
picturesque
scene
a
brook
flowing
through
a
ravine
in
the
high
bank
fell
in
many
little
cascades
to
the
broad
river
beneath
its
margins
decked
out
with
an
infinite
variety
of
beautiful
plants
wild
bananas
arched
over
the
watercourse
and
the
trunks
of
the
trees
in
its
vicinity
were
clothed
with
ferns
species
belonging
to
the
genus
lygodium
which
like
osmunda
have
their
collected
together
on
contracted
leaves
on
the
we
arrived
at
a
large
fazenda
plantation
and
cattle
farm
called
jatuarana
a
rocky
point
here
projects
into
the
stream
and
as
we
found
it
impossible
to
stem
the
strong
current
which
whirled
around
it
we
crossed
over
to
the
southern
shore
canoes
in
approaching
the
rio
negro
generally
prefer
the
southern
side
on
account
of
the
slackness
of
the
current
near
the
banks
our
progress
however
was
most
tediously
slow
for
the
regular
east
wind
had
now
entirely
ceased
and
the
vento
de
cima
or
wind
from
up
river
having
taken
its
place
blew
daily
for
a
few
hours
dead
against
us
the
weather
was
oppressively
close
and
every
afternoon
a
squall
arose
which
however
as
it
came
from
the
right
quarter
and
blew
for
an
hour
or
two
was
very
welcome
we
made
acquaintance
on
this
coast
with
a
new
insect
pest
the
pium
a
minute
fly
two
thirds
of
a
line
in
length
which
here
commences
its
reign
and
continues
henceforward
as
a
terrible
scourge
along
the
upper
river
or
solimoens
to
the
end
of
the
navigation
on
the
amazons
it
comes
forth
only
by
day
relieving
the
mosquito
at
sunrise
with
the
greatest
punctuality
and
occurs
only
near
the
muddy
shores
of
the
stream
not
one
ever
being
found
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
in
places
where
it
is
abundant
it
accompanies
canoes
in
such
dense
swarms
as
to
resemble
thin
clouds
of
smoke
it
made
its
appearance
in
this
way
the
first
day
after
we
crossed
the
river
before
i
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
flies
i
felt
a
slight
itching
on
my
neck
wrist
and
ankles
and
on
looking
for
the
cause
saw
a
number
of
tiny
objects
having
a
disgusting
resemblance
to
lice
adhering
to
the
skin
this
was
my
introduction
to
the
pium
on
close
examination
they
are
seen
to
be
minute
insects
with
dark
coloured
body
and
pale
legs
and
wings
the
latter
closed
lengthwise
over
the
back
they
alight
imperceptibly
and
squatting
close
fall
at
once
to
work
stretching
forward
their
long
front
legs
which
are
in
constant
motion
and
seem
to
act
as
feelers
and
then
applying
their
short
broad
snouts
to
the
skin
their
abdomens
soon
become
distended
and
red
with
blood
and
then
their
thirst
satisfied
they
slowly
move
off
sometimes
so
stupefied
with
their
potations
that
they
can
scarcely
fly
no
pain
is
felt
while
they
are
at
work
but
they
each
leave
a
small
circular
raised
spot
on
the
skin
and
a
disagreeable
irritation
the
latter
may
be
avoided
in
great
measure
by
pressing
out
the
blood
which
remains
in
the
spot
but
this
is
a
troublesome
task
when
one
has
several
hundred
punctures
in
the
course
of
a
day
i
took
the
trouble
to
dissect
specimens
to
ascertain
the
way
in
which
the
little
pests
operate
the
mouth
consists
of
a
pair
of
thick
fleshy
lips
and
two
triangular
horny
lancets
answering
to
the
upper
lip
and
tongue
of
other
insects
this
is
applied
closely
to
the
skin
a
puncture
is
made
with
the
lancets
and
the
blood
then
sucked
through
between
these
into
the
oesophagus
the
circular
spot
which
results
coinciding
with
the
shape
of
the
lips
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
red
spots
dry
up
and
the
skin
in
time
becomes
blackened
with
the
endless
number
of
discoloured
punctures
that
are
crowded
together
the
irritation
they
produce
is
more
acutely
felt
by
some
persons
than
others
i
once
travelled
with
a
portuguese
who
was
laid
up
for
three
weeks
from
the
attacks
of
pium
his
legs
being
swelled
to
an
enormous
size
and
the
punctures
aggravated
into
spreading
sores
a
brisk
wind
from
the
east
sprang
tip
early
in
the
morning
of
the
we
then
hoisted
all
sail
and
made
for
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
this
noble
stream
at
its
junction
with
the
amazons
seems
from
its
position
to
be
a
direct
continuation
of
the
main
river
while
the
solimoens
which
joins
at
an
angle
and
is
somewhat
narrower
than
its
tributary
appears
to
be
a
branch
instead
of
the
main
trunk
of
the
vast
water
system
one
sees
at
once
therefore
how
the
early
explorers
came
to
give
a
separate
name
to
this
upper
part
of
the
amazons
the
brazilians
have
lately
taken
to
applying
the
convenient
term
alto
amazonas
high
or
upper
amazons
to
the
solimoens
and
it
is
probable
that
this
will
gradually
prevail
over
the
old
name
the
rio
negro
broadens
considerably
from
its
mouth
upwards
and
presents
the
appearance
of
a
great
lake
its
waters
having
no
current
and
seeming
to
be
dammed
up
by
the
impetuous
flow
of
the
yellow
turbid
solimoens
which
here
belches
forth
a
continuous
line
of
uprooted
trees
and
patches
of
grass
and
forms
a
striking
contrast
with
its
tributary
in
crossing
we
passed
the
line
a
little
more
than
halfway
over
where
the
waters
of
the
two
rivers
meet
and
are
sharply
demarcated
from
each
other
on
reaching
the
opposite
shore
we
found
a
remarkable
change
all
our
insect
pests
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
even
from
the
hold
of
the
canoe
the
turmoil
of
an
agitated
swiftly
flowing
river
and
its
torn
perpendicular
earthy
banks
had
given
place
to
tranquil
water
and
a
coast
indented
with
snug
little
bays
fringed
with
sloping
sandy
beaches
the
low
shore
and
vivid
foliage
which
prevailed
on
the
south
side
of
the
amazons
were
exchanged
for
a
hilly
country
clothed
with
a
sombre
rounded
and
monotonous
forest
our
tedious
voyage
now
approached
its
termination
a
light
wind
carried
us
gently
along
the
coast
to
the
city
of
barra
which
lies
about
seven
or
eight
miles
within
the
mouth
of
the
river
we
stopped
for
an
hour
in
a
clean
little
bay
to
bathe
and
dress
before
showing
ourselves
again
among
civilised
people
the
bottom
was
visible
at
a
depth
of
six
feet
the
white
sand
taking
a
brownish
tinge
from
the
stained
but
clear
water
in
the
evening
i
went
ashore
and
was
kindly
received
by
senor
henriques
antony
a
italian
established
here
in
a
high
position
as
merchant
who
was
the
friend
of
stray
travellers
he
placed
a
couple
of
rooms
at
my
disposal
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
comfortably
settled
in
my
new
quarters
days
after
leaving
obydos
the
town
of
barra
is
built
on
a
tract
of
elevated
but
very
uneven
land
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rio
negro
and
contained
in
about
inhabitants
there
was
originally
a
small
fort
here
erected
by
the
portuguese
to
protect
their
expeditions
amongst
the
numerous
tribes
of
indians
which
peopled
the
banks
of
the
river
the
most
distinguished
and
warlike
of
these
were
the
manaos
who
were
continually
at
war
with
the
neighbouring
tribes
and
had
the
custom
of
enslaving
the
prisoners
made
during
their
predatory
expeditions
the
portuguese
disguised
their
motives
under
the
pretext
of
ransoming
resgatando
these
captives
indeed
the
term
resgatar
to
ransom
is
still
applied
by
the
traders
on
the
upper
amazons
to
the
very
general
but
illegal
practice
of
purchasing
indian
children
of
the
wild
tribes
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
place
remember
the
time
when
many
hundreds
of
these
captives
were
brought
down
by
a
single
expedition
in
barra
became
the
chief
town
of
the
rio
negro
district
many
portuguese
and
brazilians
from
other
provinces
then
settled
here
spacious
houses
were
built
and
it
grew
in
the
course
of
thirty
or
forty
years
to
be
next
to
santarem
the
principal
settlement
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
at
the
time
of
my
visit
it
was
on
the
decline
in
consequence
of
the
growing
distrust
or
increased
cunning
of
the
indians
who
once
formed
a
numerous
and
the
sole
labouring
class
but
having
got
to
know
that
the
laws
protected
them
against
forced
servitude
were
rapidly
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
place
when
the
new
province
of
the
amazons
was
established
in
barra
was
chosen
as
the
capital
and
was
then
invested
with
the
appropriate
name
of
the
city
of
manaos
the
situation
of
the
town
has
many
advantages
the
climate
is
healthy
there
are
no
insect
pests
the
soil
is
fertile
and
capable
of
growing
all
kinds
of
tropical
produce
the
coffee
of
the
rio
negro
especially
being
of
very
superior
quality
and
it
is
near
the
fork
of
two
great
navigable
rivers
the
imagination
becomes
excited
when
one
reflects
on
the
possible
future
of
this
place
situated
near
the
centre
of
the
equatorial
part
of
south
america
in
the
midst
of
a
region
almost
as
large
as
europe
every
inch
of
whose
soil
is
of
the
most
exuberant
fertility
and
having
water
communication
on
one
side
with
the
atlantic
and
on
the
other
with
the
spanish
republics
of
venezuela
new
granada
ecuador
peru
and
bolivia
barra
is
now
the
principal
station
for
the
lines
of
steamers
which
were
established
in
and
passengers
and
goods
are
transhipped
here
for
the
solimoens
and
peru
a
steamer
runs
once
a
fortnight
between
para
and
barra
and
a
one
plies
between
this
place
and
nauta
in
the
peruvian
territory
the
company
is
supported
by
a
large
annual
grant
about
sterling
from
the
imperial
government
barra
was
formerly
a
pleasant
place
of
residence
but
it
is
now
in
a
most
wretched
plight
suffering
from
a
chronic
scarcity
of
the
most
necessary
articles
of
food
the
attention
of
the
settlers
was
formerly
devoted
almost
entirely
to
the
collection
of
the
spontaneous
produce
of
the
forests
and
rivers
agriculture
was
consequently
neglected
and
now
the
neighbourhood
does
not
produce
even
sufficient
for
its
own
consumption
many
of
the
most
necessary
articles
of
food
besides
all
luxuries
come
from
portugal
england
and
north
america
a
few
bullocks
are
brought
now
and
then
from
obydos
miles
off
the
nearest
place
where
cattle
are
reared
in
any
numbers
and
these
furnish
at
long
intervals
a
supply
of
fresh
beef
but
this
is
generally
monopolised
by
the
families
of
government
officials
fowls
eggs
fresh
fish
turtles
vegetables
and
fruit
were
excessively
scarce
and
dear
in
when
i
again
visited
the
place
for
instance
six
or
seven
shillings
were
asked
for
a
poor
lean
fowl
and
eggs
were
a
piece
in
fact
the
neighbourhood
produces
scarcely
anything
the
provincial
government
is
supplied
with
the
greater
part
of
its
funds
from
the
treasury
of
para
its
revenue
which
amounts
to
about
fifty
contos
of
reis
derived
from
export
taxes
on
the
produce
of
the
entire
province
not
sufficing
for
more
than
about
of
its
expenditure
the
population
of
the
province
of
the
amazons
according
to
a
census
taken
in
is
souls
the
municipal
district
of
barra
which
comprises
a
large
area
around
the
capital
containing
only
inhabitants
for
the
government
however
of
this
small
number
of
people
an
immense
staff
of
officials
is
gathered
together
in
the
capital
and
notwithstanding
the
endless
number
of
trivial
formalities
which
brazilians
employ
in
every
small
detail
of
administration
these
have
nothing
to
do
the
greater
part
of
their
time
none
of
the
people
who
flocked
to
barra
on
the
establishment
of
the
new
government
seemed
to
care
about
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
and
the
raising
of
food
although
these
would
have
been
most
profitable
speculations
the
class
of
portuguese
who
emigrate
to
brazil
seem
to
prefer
petty
trading
to
the
honourable
pursuit
of
agriculture
if
the
english
are
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
what
are
we
to
say
of
the
portuguese
i
counted
in
barra
one
store
for
every
five
houses
these
stores
or
tavernas
have
often
not
more
than
fifty
pounds
worth
of
goods
for
their
whole
stock
and
the
portuguese
owners
big
lusty
fellows
stand
all
day
behind
their
dirty
counters
for
the
sake
of
selling
a
few
coppers
worth
of
liquors
or
small
wares
these
men
all
give
the
same
excuse
for
not
applying
themselves
to
agriculture
namely
that
no
hands
can
be
obtained
to
work
on
the
soil
nothing
can
be
done
with
indians
indeed
they
are
fast
leaving
the
neighbourhood
altogether
and
the
importation
of
negro
slaves
in
the
present
praiseworthy
temper
of
the
brazilian
mind
is
out
of
the
question
the
problem
how
to
obtain
a
labouring
class
for
a
new
and
tropical
country
without
slavery
has
to
be
solved
before
this
glorious
region
can
become
what
its
delightful
climate
and
exuberant
fertility
fit
it
for
the
abode
of
a
numerous
civilised
and
happy
people
i
found
at
barra
my
companion
wallace
who
since
our
joint
tocantins
expedition
had
been
exploring
partly
with
his
brother
lately
arrived
from
england
the
northeastern
coast
of
marajo
the
river
capim
a
branch
of
the
guama
near
para
monte
alegre
and
santarem
he
had
passed
us
by
night
below
serpa
on
his
way
to
barra
and
so
had
arrived
about
three
weeks
before
me
besides
ourselves
there
were
other
foreigners
here
congregated
englishmen
germans
and
americans
one
of
them
a
natural
history
collector
the
rest
traders
on
the
rivers
in
the
pleasant
society
of
these
and
of
the
family
of
senor
henriques
we
passed
a
delightful
time
the
miseries
of
our
long
river
voyages
were
soon
forgotten
and
in
two
or
three
weeks
we
began
to
talk
of
further
explorations
meantime
we
had
almost
daily
rambles
in
the
neighbouring
forest
the
whole
surface
of
the
land
down
to
the
water
edge
is
covered
by
the
uniform
rolling
forest
the
convex
woods
of
the
indians
characteristic
of
the
rio
negro
this
clothes
also
the
extensive
areas
of
lowland
which
are
flooded
by
the
river
in
the
rainy
season
the
tinge
of
the
water
seems
to
be
derived
from
the
saturation
in
it
of
the
dark
green
foliage
during
these
annual
inundations
the
great
contrast
in
form
and
colour
between
the
forest
of
the
rio
negro
and
those
of
the
amazons
arises
from
the
predominance
in
each
of
different
families
of
plants
on
the
main
river
palms
of
twenty
or
thirty
different
species
form
a
great
proportion
of
the
mass
of
trees
while
on
the
rio
negro
they
play
a
very
subordinate
part
the
characteristic
kind
in
the
latter
region
is
the
jara
leopoldinia
pulchra
a
species
not
found
on
the
margins
of
the
amazons
which
has
a
scanty
head
of
fronds
with
narrow
leaflets
of
the
same
dark
green
hue
as
the
rest
of
the
forest
the
stem
is
smooth
and
about
two
inches
in
diameter
its
height
is
not
more
than
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
it
does
not
therefore
rise
amongst
the
masses
of
foliage
of
the
exogenous
trees
so
as
to
form
a
feature
in
the
landscape
like
the
murumuru
and
urucuri
the
slender
assai
the
tall
jauari
and
the
muriti
of
the
banks
of
the
amazons
on
the
shores
of
the
main
river
the
mass
of
the
forest
is
composed
besides
palms
of
leguminosae
or
trees
of
the
bean
family
in
endless
variety
as
to
height
shape
of
foliage
flowers
and
fruit
of
trees
colossal
lecythideae
and
cecropiae
the
underwood
and
consisting
in
great
part
of
musaceae
marantaceae
and
succulent
grasses
all
of
which
are
of
light
shades
of
green
the
forests
of
the
rio
negro
are
almost
destitute
of
these
plants
and
grasses
which
give
so
rich
an
appearance
to
the
vegetation
wherever
they
grow
the
margins
of
the
stream
being
clothed
with
bushes
or
low
trees
having
the
same
gloomy
monotonous
aspect
as
the
mangroves
of
the
shores
of
creeks
near
the
atlantic
the
uniformly
small
but
exogenous
trees
which
constitute
the
mass
of
the
forest
consist
in
great
part
of
members
of
the
laurel
myrtle
bignoniaceous
and
rubiaceous
orders
the
soil
is
generally
a
stiff
loam
whose
chief
component
part
is
the
tabatinga
clay
which
also
forms
low
cliffs
on
the
coast
in
some
places
where
it
overlies
strata
of
coarse
sandstone
this
kind
of
soil
and
the
same
geological
formation
prevail
as
we
have
seen
in
many
places
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
so
that
the
great
contrast
in
the
of
the
two
rivers
can
not
arise
from
this
cause
the
forest
was
very
pleasant
for
rambling
in
some
directions
broad
pathways
led
down
gentle
slopes
through
what
one
might
fancy
were
interminable
shrubberies
of
evergreens
to
moist
hollows
where
springs
of
water
bubbled
up
or
shallowbrooks
ran
over
their
beds
of
clean
white
sand
but
the
most
beautiful
road
was
one
that
ran
through
the
heart
of
the
forest
to
a
waterfall
which
the
citizens
of
barra
consider
as
the
chief
natural
curiosity
of
their
neighbourhood
the
waters
of
one
of
the
larger
rivulets
which
traverse
the
gloomy
wilderness
here
fall
over
a
ledge
of
rock
about
ten
feet
high
it
is
not
the
cascade
itself
but
the
noiseless
solitude
and
the
marvellous
diversity
and
richness
of
trees
foliage
and
flowers
encircling
the
water
basin
that
form
the
attraction
of
the
place
families
make
picnic
excursions
to
this
spot
and
the
gentlemen
it
is
said
the
ladies
also
spend
the
sultry
hours
of
midday
bathing
in
the
cold
and
bracing
waters
the
place
is
classic
ground
to
the
naturalist
from
having
been
a
favourite
spot
with
the
celebrated
travellers
spix
and
martius
during
their
stay
at
barra
in
von
martins
was
so
much
impressed
by
its
magical
beauty
that
he
commemorated
the
visit
by
making
a
sketch
of
the
scenery
serve
as
background
in
one
of
the
plates
of
his
great
work
on
the
palms
birds
and
insects
however
were
scarce
amidst
these
charming
sylvan
scenes
i
have
often
traversed
the
whole
distance
from
barra
to
the
waterfall
about
two
miles
by
the
forest
road
without
seeing
or
hearing
a
bird
or
meeting
with
so
many
as
a
score
of
lepidopterous
and
coleopterous
insects
in
the
thinner
woods
near
the
borders
of
the
forest
many
pretty
little
blue
and
green
creepers
of
the
dacnidae
group
were
daily
seen
feeding
on
berries
and
a
few
very
handsome
birds
occurred
in
the
forest
but
the
latter
were
so
rare
that
we
could
obtain
them
only
by
employing
a
native
hunter
who
used
to
spend
a
whole
day
and
go
a
great
distance
to
obtain
two
or
three
specimens
in
this
way
i
obtained
amongst
others
specimens
of
the
trogon
pavoninus
the
suruqua
grande
of
the
natives
a
most
beautiful
creature
having
soft
golden
green
plumage
red
breast
and
an
beak
also
the
ampelis
pompadoura
a
rich
chatterer
with
wings
of
a
hue
after
we
had
rested
some
weeks
in
barra
we
arranged
our
plans
for
further
explorations
in
the
interior
of
the
country
wallace
chose
the
rio
negro
for
his
next
trip
and
i
agreed
to
take
the
solimoens
my
colleague
has
already
given
to
the
world
an
account
of
his
journey
on
the
rio
negro
and
his
adventurous
ascent
of
its
great
tributary
the
uapes
i
left
barra
for
ega
the
first
town
of
any
importance
on
the
solimoens
on
the
of
march
the
distance
is
nearly
miles
which
we
accomplished
in
a
small
cuberta
manned
by
ten
stout
cucama
indians
in
days
on
this
occasion
i
spent
twelve
months
in
the
upper
region
of
the
amazons
circumstances
then
compelled
me
to
return
to
para
i
revisited
the
same
country
in
and
devoted
three
years
and
a
half
to
a
fuller
exploration
of
its
natural
productions
the
results
of
both
journeys
will
be
given
together
in
subsequent
chapters
of
this
work
in
the
meantime
i
will
proceed
to
give
an
account
of
santarem
and
the
river
tapajos
whose
neighbourhoods
i
investigated
in
the
years
a
few
words
on
my
visit
to
para
in
may
be
here
introduced
i
descended
the
river
from
ega
to
the
capital
a
distance
of
miles
in
a
schooner
belonging
to
a
trader
of
the
former
place
the
voyage
occupied
no
less
than
days
although
we
were
favoured
by
the
powerful
currents
of
the
rainy
season
the
hold
of
the
vessel
was
filled
with
turtle
oil
contained
in
large
jars
the
cabin
was
crammed
with
brazil
nuts
and
a
great
pile
of
sarsaparilla
covered
with
a
thatch
of
palm
leaves
occupied
the
middle
of
the
deck
we
had
therefore
the
master
and
two
passengers
but
rough
accommodation
having
to
sleep
on
deck
exposed
to
the
wet
and
stormy
weather
under
little
toldos
or
arched
shelters
arranged
with
mats
of
woven
lianas
and
maranta
leaves
i
awoke
many
a
morning
with
clothes
and
bedding
soaked
through
with
the
rain
with
the
exception
however
of
a
slight
cold
at
the
commencement
i
never
enjoyed
better
health
than
during
this
journey
when
the
wind
blew
from
up
river
or
off
the
land
we
sped
away
at
a
great
rate
but
it
was
often
squally
from
those
quarters
and
then
it
was
not
safe
to
hoist
the
sails
the
weather
was
generally
calm
a
motionless
mass
of
leaden
clouds
covering
the
sky
and
the
broad
expanse
of
waters
flowing
smoothly
down
with
no
other
motion
than
the
ripple
of
the
current
when
the
wind
came
from
below
we
tacked
down
the
stream
sometimes
it
blew
very
strong
and
then
the
schooner
having
the
wind
abeam
laboured
through
the
waves
shipping
often
heavy
seas
which
washed
everything
that
was
loose
from
one
side
of
the
deck
to
the
other
on
arriving
at
para
i
found
the
once
cheerful
and
healthy
city
desolated
by
two
terrible
epidemics
the
yellow
fever
which
visited
the
place
the
previous
year
for
the
first
time
since
the
discovery
of
the
country
still
lingered
after
having
carried
off
nearly
percent
of
the
population
the
number
of
persons
who
were
attacked
namely
of
the
entire
population
showed
how
general
the
onslaught
is
of
an
epidemic
on
its
first
appearance
in
a
place
at
the
heels
of
this
plague
came
the
smallpox
the
yellow
fever
had
fallen
most
severely
on
the
whites
and
mamelucos
the
negroes
wholly
escaping
but
the
smallpox
attacked
more
especially
the
indians
negroes
and
people
of
mixed
colour
sparing
the
whites
almost
entirely
and
taking
off
about
a
twentieth
part
of
the
population
in
the
course
of
the
four
months
of
its
stay
i
heard
many
strange
accounts
of
the
yellow
fever
i
believe
para
was
the
second
port
in
brazil
attacked
by
it
the
news
of
its
ravages
in
bahia
where
the
epidemic
first
appeared
arrived
some
few
days
before
the
disease
broke
out
the
government
took
all
the
sanitary
precautions
that
could
be
thought
of
amongst
the
rest
was
the
singular
one
of
firing
cannon
at
the
street
corners
to
purify
the
air
norris
the
american
consul
told
me
the
first
cases
of
fever
occurred
near
the
port
and
that
it
spread
rapidly
and
regularly
from
house
to
house
along
the
streets
which
run
from
the
waterside
to
the
suburbs
taking
about
hours
to
reach
the
end
some
persons
related
that
for
several
successive
evenings
before
the
fever
broke
out
the
atmosphere
was
thick
and
that
a
body
of
murky
vapour
accompanied
by
a
strong
stench
travelled
from
street
to
street
this
moving
vapour
was
called
the
mai
da
peste
the
mother
or
spirit
of
the
plague
and
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
reason
them
out
of
the
belief
that
this
was
the
forerunner
of
the
pestilence
the
progress
of
the
disease
was
very
rapid
it
commenced
in
april
in
the
middle
of
the
wet
season
in
a
few
days
thousands
of
persons
lay
sick
dying
or
dead
the
state
of
the
city
during
the
time
the
fever
lasted
may
be
easily
imagined
towards
the
end
of
june
it
abated
and
very
few
cases
occurred
during
the
dry
season
from
july
to
december
as
i
said
before
the
yellow
fever
still
lingered
in
the
place
when
i
arrived
from
the
interior
in
april
i
was
in
hopes
i
should
escape
it
but
was
not
so
fortunate
it
seemed
to
spare
no
newcomer
at
the
time
i
fell
ill
every
medical
man
in
the
place
was
worked
to
the
utmost
in
attending
the
victims
of
the
other
epidemic
it
was
quite
useless
to
think
of
obtaining
their
aid
so
i
was
obliged
to
be
my
own
doctor
as
i
had
been
in
many
former
smart
attacks
of
fever
i
was
seized
with
shivering
and
vomit
at
nine
in
the
morning
while
the
people
of
the
house
went
down
to
the
town
for
the
medicines
i
ordered
i
wrapped
myself
in
a
blanket
and
walked
sharply
to
and
fro
along
the
veranda
drinking
at
intervals
a
cup
of
warm
tea
made
of
a
bitter
herb
in
use
amongst
the
natives
called
pajemarioba
a
leguminous
plant
growing
in
all
waste
places
about
an
hour
afterwards
i
took
a
good
draught
of
a
decoction
of
elder
blossoms
as
a
sudorific
and
soon
after
fell
insensible
into
my
hammock
philipps
an
english
resident
with
whom
i
was
then
lodging
came
home
in
the
afternoon
and
found
me
sound
asleep
and
perspiring
famously
i
did
not
wake
until
almost
midnight
when
i
felt
very
weak
and
aching
in
every
bone
of
my
body
i
then
took
as
a
purgative
a
small
dose
of
epsom
salts
and
manna
in
eight
hours
the
fever
left
me
and
in
eight
days
from
the
first
attack
i
was
able
to
get
about
my
work
little
else
happened
during
my
stay
which
need
be
recorded
here
i
shipped
off
all
my
collections
to
england
and
received
thence
a
fresh
supply
of
funds
it
took
me
several
weeks
to
prepare
for
my
second
and
longest
journey
into
the
interior
my
plan
now
was
first
to
make
santarem
headquarters
for
some
time
and
ascend
from
that
place
the
river
tapajos
as
far
as
practicable
afterwards
i
intended
to
revisit
the
marvellous
country
of
the
upper
amazons
and
work
well
its
natural
history
at
various
stations
i
had
fixed
upon
from
ega
to
the
foot
of
the
andes

and

i
have
already
given
a
short
account
of
the
size
situation
and
general
appearance
of
santarem
although
containing
not
more
than
inhabitants
it
is
the
most
civilised
and
important
settlement
on
the
banks
of
the
main
river
from
peru
to
the
atlantic
the
pretty
little
town
or
city
as
it
is
called
with
its
rows
of
tolerably
uniform
and
houses
surrounded
by
green
gardens
and
woods
stands
on
gently
sloping
ground
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
tapajos
close
to
its
point
of
junction
with
the
amazons
a
small
eminence
on
which
a
fort
has
been
erected
but
which
is
now
in
a
dilapidated
condition
overlooks
the
streets
and
forms
the
eastern
limit
of
the
mouth
of
the
tributary
the
tapajos
at
santarem
is
contracted
to
a
breadth
of
about
a
mile
and
a
half
by
an
accretion
of
low
alluvial
land
which
forms
a
kind
of
delta
on
the
western
side
fifteen
miles
further
up
the
river
is
seen
at
its
full
width
of
from
ten
to
a
dozen
miles
and
the
magnificent
hilly
country
through
which
it
flows
from
the
south
is
then
visible
on
both
shores
this
high
land
which
appears
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
central
of
brazil
stretches
almost
without
interruption
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
down
to
its
mouth
at
santarem
the
scenery
as
well
as
the
soil
vegetation
and
animal
tenants
of
this
region
are
widely
different
from
those
of
the
flat
and
uniform
country
which
borders
the
amazons
along
most
part
of
its
course
after
travelling
week
after
week
on
the
main
river
the
aspect
of
santarem
with
its
broad
white
sandy
beach
limpid
waters
and
line
of
picturesque
hills
rising
behind
over
the
fringe
of
green
forest
affords
an
agreeable
surprise
on
the
main
amazons
the
prospect
is
monotonous
unless
the
vessel
runs
near
the
shore
when
the
wonderful
diversity
and
beauty
of
the
vegetation
afford
constant
entertainment
otherwise
the
unvaried
broad
yellow
stream
and
the
long
low
line
of
forest
which
dwindles
away
in
a
broken
line
of
trees
on
the
horizon
and
is
renewed
reach
after
reach
as
the
voyages
advances
weary
by
their
uniformity
i
arrived
at
santarem
on
my
second
journey
into
the
interior
in
november
and
made
it
my
headquarters
for
a
period
as
it
turned
out
of
three
years
and
a
half
during
this
time
i
made
in
pursuance
of
the
plan
i
had
framed
many
excursions
up
the
tapajos
and
to
other
places
of
interest
in
the
surrounding
region
on
landing
i
found
no
difficulty
in
hiring
a
suitable
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
place
it
was
pleasantly
situated
near
the
beach
going
towards
the
aldeia
or
indian
part
of
the
town
the
ground
sloped
from
the
back
premises
down
to
the
waterside
and
my
little
raised
veranda
overlooked
a
beautiful
flower
garden
a
great
rarity
in
this
country
which
belonged
to
the
neighbours
the
house
contained
only
three
rooms
one
with
brick
and
two
with
boarded
floors
it
was
substantially
built
like
all
the
better
sort
of
houses
in
santarem
and
had
a
stuccoed
front
the
kitchen
as
is
usual
formed
an
outhouse
placed
a
few
yards
distant
from
the
other
rooms
the
rent
was
reis
or
about
shillings
a
month
in
this
country
a
tenant
has
no
extra
payments
to
make
the
owners
of
house
property
pay
a
dizimo
or
tithe
to
the
collectoria
general
or
general
treasury
but
with
this
the
occupier
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
in
engaging
servants
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
a
free
mulatto
an
industrious
and
trustworthy
young
fellow
named
jose
willing
to
arrange
with
me
the
people
of
his
family
cooked
for
us
while
he
assisted
me
in
collecting
he
proved
of
the
greatest
service
in
the
different
excursions
we
subsequently
made
servants
of
any
kind
were
almost
impossible
to
be
obtained
at
santarem
free
people
being
too
proud
to
hire
themselves
and
slaves
too
few
and
valuable
to
their
masters
to
be
let
out
to
others
these
matters
arranged
the
house
put
in
order
and
a
rude
table
with
a
few
chairs
bought
or
borrowed
to
furnish
the
house
with
i
was
ready
in
three
or
four
days
to
commence
my
natural
history
explorations
in
the
neighbourhood
i
found
santarem
quite
a
different
sort
of
place
from
the
other
settlements
on
the
amazons
at
cameta
the
lively
and
mamelucos
formed
the
bulk
of
the
population
the
white
immigrants
there
as
on
the
rionegro
and
upper
amazons
seeming
to
have
fraternised
well
with
the
aborigines
in
the
neighbourhood
of
santarem
the
indians
i
believe
were
originally
hostile
to
the
portuguese
at
any
rate
the
blending
of
the
two
races
has
not
been
here
on
a
large
scale
i
did
not
find
the
inhabitants
the
pleasant
easygoing
and
country
folk
that
are
met
with
in
other
small
towns
of
the
interior
the
whites
portuguese
and
brazilians
are
a
relatively
more
numerous
class
here
than
in
other
settlements
and
make
great
pretensions
to
civilisation
they
are
the
merchants
and
shopkeepers
of
the
place
owners
of
slaves
cattle
estates
and
cacao
plantations
amongst
the
principal
residents
must
also
be
mentioned
the
civil
and
military
authorities
who
are
generally
and
intelligent
people
from
other
provinces
few
indians
live
in
the
place
it
is
too
civilised
for
them
and
the
lower
class
is
made
up
besides
the
few
slaves
of
in
whose
composition
negro
blood
predominates
coloured
people
also
exercise
the
different
handicrafts
the
town
supports
two
goldsmiths
who
are
mulattoes
and
have
each
several
apprentices
the
blacksmiths
are
chiefly
indians
as
is
the
case
generally
throughout
the
province
the
manners
of
the
upper
class
copied
from
those
of
para
are
very
stiff
and
formal
and
the
absence
of
the
hearty
hospitality
met
with
in
other
places
produces
a
disagreeable
impression
at
first
much
ceremony
is
observed
in
the
intercourse
of
the
principal
people
with
each
other
and
with
strangers
the
best
room
in
each
house
is
set
apart
for
receptions
and
visitors
are
expected
to
present
themselves
in
black
dress
coats
regardless
of
the
furious
heat
which
rages
in
the
sandy
streets
of
santarem
towards
midday
the
hour
when
visits
are
generally
made
in
the
room
a
sofa
and
chairs
all
lacquered
and
gilded
are
arranged
in
quadrangular
form
and
here
the
visitors
are
invited
to
seat
themselves
while
the
compliments
are
passed
or
the
business
arranged
in
taking
leave
the
host
backs
out
his
guests
with
repeated
bows
finishing
at
the
front
door
smoking
is
not
in
vogue
amongst
this
class
but
taking
is
largely
indulged
in
and
great
luxury
is
displayed
in
gold
and
silver
all
the
gentlemen
and
indeed
most
of
the
ladies
also
wear
gold
watches
and
guard
chains
social
parties
are
not
very
frequent
the
principal
men
being
fully
occupied
with
their
business
and
families
and
the
rest
spending
their
leisure
in
billiard
and
gambling
rooms
leaving
wives
and
daughters
shut
up
at
home
occasionally
however
one
of
the
principal
citizens
gives
a
ball
in
the
first
that
i
attended
the
gentlemen
were
seated
all
the
evening
on
one
side
of
the
room
and
the
ladies
on
the
other
and
partners
were
allotted
by
means
of
numbered
cards
distributed
by
a
master
of
the
ceremonies
but
the
customs
changed
rapidly
in
these
matters
after
steamers
began
to
run
on
the
amazons
in
bringing
a
flood
of
new
ideas
and
fashions
into
the
country
the
old
bigoted
portuguese
system
of
treating
women
which
stifled
social
intercourse
and
wrought
endless
evils
in
the
private
life
of
the
brazilians
is
now
being
gradually
although
slowly
abandoned
the
religious
festivals
were
not
so
numerous
here
as
in
other
towns
and
when
they
did
take
place
were
very
poor
and
ill
attended
there
is
a
handsome
church
but
the
vicar
showed
remarkably
little
zeal
for
religion
except
for
a
few
days
now
and
then
when
the
bishop
came
from
para
on
his
rounds
through
the
diocese
the
people
are
as
fond
of
here
as
in
other
parts
of
the
province
but
it
seemed
to
be
a
growing
fashion
to
substitute
rational
amusements
for
the
processions
and
mummeries
of
the
saints
days
the
young
folks
are
very
musical
the
principal
instruments
in
use
being
the
flute
violin
spanish
guitar
and
a
small
viola
called
cavaquinho
during
the
early
part
of
my
stay
at
santarem
a
little
party
of
instrumentalists
led
by
a
tall
thin
ragged
mulatto
who
was
quite
an
enthusiast
in
his
art
used
frequently
to
serenade
their
friends
in
the
cool
and
brilliant
moonlit
evenings
of
the
dry
season
playing
french
and
italian
marches
and
dance
music
with
very
good
effect
the
guitar
was
the
favourite
instrument
with
both
sexes
as
at
para
the
piano
however
is
now
fast
superseding
it
the
ballads
sung
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
guitar
were
not
learned
from
written
or
printed
music
but
communicated
orally
from
one
friend
to
another
they
were
never
spoken
of
as
songs
but
modinas
or
little
fashions
each
of
which
had
its
day
giving
way
to
the
next
favourite
brought
by
some
young
fellow
from
the
capital
at
festival
times
there
was
a
great
deal
of
masquerading
in
which
all
the
people
old
and
young
white
negro
and
indian
took
great
delight
the
best
things
of
this
kind
used
to
come
off
during
the
carnival
in
easter
week
and
on
john
eve
the
negroes
having
a
grand
display
in
the
streets
at
christmas
time
the
more
select
affairs
were
got
up
by
the
young
whites
and
coloured
men
associating
with
whites
a
party
of
thirty
or
forty
of
these
used
to
dress
themselves
in
uniform
style
and
in
very
good
taste
as
cavaliers
and
dames
each
disguised
with
a
peculiar
kind
of
light
gauze
mask
the
troop
with
a
party
of
musicians
went
the
round
of
their
houses
in
the
evening
and
treated
the
large
and
companies
which
were
there
assembled
to
a
variety
of
dances
the
principal
citizens
in
the
large
rooms
of
whose
houses
these
entertainments
were
given
seemed
quite
to
enjoy
them
great
preparations
were
made
at
each
place
and
after
the
dance
guests
and
masqueraders
were
regaled
with
pale
ale
and
sweetmeats
once
a
year
the
indians
with
whom
masked
dances
and
acting
are
indigenous
had
their
turn
and
on
one
occasion
they
gave
us
a
great
treat
they
assembled
from
different
parts
of
the
neighbourhood
at
night
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
then
marched
through
the
streets
by
torchlight
towards
the
quarter
inhabited
by
the
whites
to
perform
their
hunting
and
devil
dances
before
the
doors
of
the
principal
inhabitants
there
were
about
a
hundred
men
women
and
children
in
the
procession
many
of
the
men
were
dressed
in
the
magnificent
feather
crowns
tunics
and
belts
manufactured
by
the
mundurucus
and
worn
by
them
on
festive
occasions
but
the
women
were
naked
to
the
waist
and
the
children
quite
naked
and
all
were
painted
and
smeared
red
with
anatto
the
ringleader
enacted
the
part
of
the
tushaua
or
chief
and
carried
a
sceptre
richly
decorated
with
the
orange
red
and
green
feathers
of
toucans
and
parrots
the
paje
or
came
along
puffing
at
a
long
tauari
cigar
the
instrument
by
which
he
professes
to
make
his
wonderful
cures
others
blew
harsh
jarring
blasts
with
the
ture
a
horn
made
of
long
and
thick
bamboo
with
a
split
reed
in
the
mouthpiece
this
is
the
war
trumpet
of
many
tribes
of
indians
with
which
the
sentinels
of
predatory
hordes
mounted
on
a
lofty
tree
gave
the
signal
for
attack
to
their
comrades
those
brazilians
who
are
old
enough
to
remember
the
times
of
warfare
between
indians
and
settlers
retain
a
great
horror
of
the
ture
its
loud
harsh
note
heard
in
the
dead
of
the
night
having
been
often
the
prelude
to
an
onslaught
of
bloodthirsty
muras
on
the
outlying
settlements
the
rest
of
the
men
in
the
procession
carried
bows
and
arrows
bunches
of
javelins
clubs
and
paddles
the
older
children
brought
with
them
the
household
pets
some
had
monkeys
or
coatis
on
their
shoulders
and
others
bore
tortoises
on
their
heads
the
squaws
carried
their
babies
in
aturas
or
large
baskets
slung
on
their
backs
and
secured
with
a
broad
belt
of
bast
over
their
foreheads
the
whole
thing
was
accurate
in
its
representation
of
indian
life
and
showed
more
ingenuity
than
some
people
give
the
brazilian
red
man
credit
for
it
was
got
up
spontaneously
by
the
indians
and
simply
to
amuse
the
people
of
the
place
the
people
seem
to
be
thoroughly
alive
to
the
advantages
of
education
for
their
children
besides
the
usual
primary
schools
one
for
girls
and
another
for
boys
there
is
a
third
of
a
higher
class
where
latin
and
french
amongst
other
accomplishments
are
taught
by
professors
who
like
the
common
schoolmasters
are
paid
by
the
provincial
government
this
is
used
as
a
preparatory
school
to
the
lyceum
and
bishop
seminary
institutions
at
para
whither
it
is
the
ambition
of
traders
and
planters
to
send
their
sons
to
finish
their
studies
the
rudiments
of
education
only
are
taught
in
the
primary
schools
and
it
is
surprising
how
quickly
and
well
the
little
lads
both
coloured
and
white
learn
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
but
the
simplicity
of
the
portuguese
language
which
is
written
as
it
is
pronounced
or
according
to
unvarying
rules
and
the
use
of
the
decimal
system
of
accounts
make
these
acquirements
much
easier
than
they
are
with
us
students
in
the
superior
school
have
to
pass
an
examination
before
they
can
be
admitted
at
the
colleges
in
para
and
the
managers
once
did
me
the
honour
to
make
me
one
of
the
examiners
for
the
year
the
performances
of
the
youths
most
of
whom
were
under
fourteen
years
of
age
were
very
creditable
especially
in
grammar
there
was
a
quickness
of
apprehension
displayed
which
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
a
northern
schoolmaster
the
course
of
study
followed
at
the
colleges
of
para
must
be
very
deficient
for
it
is
rare
to
meet
with
an
educated
paraense
who
has
the
slightest
knowledge
of
the
physical
sciences
or
even
of
geography
if
he
has
not
travelled
out
of
the
province
the
young
men
all
become
smart
rhetoricians
and
lawyers
any
of
them
is
ready
to
plead
in
a
law
case
at
an
hour
notice
they
are
also
great
at
statistics
for
the
gratification
of
which
taste
there
is
ample
field
in
brazil
where
every
public
officer
has
to
furnish
volumes
of
dry
reports
annually
to
the
government
but
they
are
woefully
ignorant
on
most
other
subjects
i
do
not
recollect
seeing
a
map
of
any
kind
at
santarem
the
people
have
a
suspicion
of
their
deficiencies
in
this
respect
and
it
is
difficult
to
draw
them
out
on
geography
but
one
day
a
man
holding
an
important
office
betrayed
himself
by
asking
me
on
what
side
of
the
river
was
paris
situated
this
question
did
not
arise
as
might
be
supposed
from
a
desire
for
accurate
topographical
knowledge
of
the
seine
but
from
the
idea
that
all
the
world
was
a
great
river
and
that
the
different
places
he
had
heard
of
must
lie
on
one
shore
or
the
other
the
fact
of
the
amazons
being
a
limited
stream
having
its
origin
in
narrow
rivulets
its
beginning
and
its
ending
has
never
entered
the
heads
of
most
of
the
people
who
have
passed
their
whole
lives
on
its
banks
santarem
is
a
pleasant
place
to
live
in
irrespective
of
its
society
there
are
no
insect
pests
mosquito
pium
or
motuca
the
climate
is
glorious
during
six
months
of
the
year
from
august
to
february
very
little
rain
falls
and
the
sky
is
cloudless
for
weeks
together
the
fresh
breezes
from
the
sea
nearly
miles
distant
moderating
the
great
heat
of
the
sun
the
wind
is
sometimes
so
strong
for
days
together
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
way
against
it
in
walking
along
the
streets
and
it
enters
the
open
windows
and
doors
of
houses
scattering
loose
clothing
and
papers
in
all
directions
the
place
is
considered
healthy
but
at
the
changes
of
season
severe
colds
and
ophthalmia
are
prevalent
i
found
three
englishmen
living
here
who
had
resided
many
years
in
the
town
or
its
neighbourhood
and
who
still
retained
their
florid
complexions
the
plump
and
fresh
appearance
of
many
of
the
santarem
ladies
also
bore
testimony
to
the
healthfulness
of
the
climate
the
streets
are
always
clean
and
dry
even
in
the
height
of
the
wet
season
good
order
is
always
kept
and
the
place
pretty
well
supplied
with
provisions
none
but
those
who
have
suffered
from
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
the
necessities
of
life
at
any
price
in
most
of
the
interior
settlements
of
south
america
can
appreciate
the
advantages
of
santarem
in
this
respect
everything
however
except
meat
was
dear
and
becoming
every
year
more
so
sugar
coffee
and
rice
which
ought
to
be
produced
in
surplus
in
the
neighbourhood
are
imported
from
other
provinces
and
are
high
in
price
sugar
indeed
is
a
little
dearer
here
than
in
england
there
were
two
or
three
shops
where
excellent
beef
could
be
had
daily
at
twopence
or
per
pound
the
cattle
have
not
to
be
brought
from
a
long
distance
as
at
para
being
bred
on
the
campos
which
border
the
lago
grande
only
one
or
two
days
journey
from
the
town
fresh
fish
could
be
bought
in
the
port
on
most
evenings
but
as
the
supply
did
not
equal
the
demand
there
was
always
a
race
amongst
purchasers
to
the
waterside
when
the
canoe
of
a
fisherman
hove
in
sight
very
good
bread
was
hawked
round
the
town
every
morning
with
milk
and
a
great
variety
of
fruits
and
vegetables
amongst
the
fruits
there
was
a
kind
called
atta
which
i
did
not
see
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
it
belongs
to
the
anonaceous
order
and
the
tree
which
produces
it
grows
apparently
wild
in
the
neighbourhood
of
santarem
it
is
a
little
larger
than
a
orange
and
the
rind
which
encloses
a
mass
of
rich
custardy
pulp
is
scaled
like
the
pineapple
but
green
when
ripe
and
encrusted
on
the
inside
with
sugar
to
finish
this
account
of
the
advantages
of
santarem
the
delicious
bathing
in
the
clear
waters
of
the
tapajos
may
be
mentioned
there
is
here
no
fear
of
alligators
when
the
cast
wind
blows
a
long
swell
rolls
in
on
the
clean
sandy
beach
and
the
bath
is
most
exhilarating
the
country
around
santarem
is
not
clothed
with
dense
and
lofty
forest
like
the
rest
of
the
great
humid
river
plain
of
the
amazons
it
is
a
campo
region
a
slightly
elevated
and
undulating
tract
of
land
wooded
only
in
patches
or
with
single
scattered
trees
a
good
deal
of
the
country
on
the
borders
of
the
tapajos
which
flows
from
the
great
campo
area
of
interior
brazil
is
of
this
description
it
is
on
this
account
that
i
consider
the
eastern
side
of
the
river
towards
its
mouth
to
be
a
northern
prolongation
of
the
continental
land
and
not
a
portion
of
the
alluvial
flats
of
the
amazons
the
soil
is
a
coarse
gritty
sand
the
substratum
which
is
visible
in
some
places
consisting
of
sandstone
conglomerate
probably
of
the
same
formation
as
that
which
underlies
the
tabatinga
clay
in
other
parts
of
the
river
valley
the
surface
is
carpeted
with
slender
hairy
grasses
unfit
for
pasture
growing
to
a
uniform
height
of
about
a
foot
the
patches
of
wood
look
like
copses
in
the
middle
of
green
meadows
they
are
called
by
the
natives
ilhas
de
mato
or
islands
of
jungle
the
name
being
no
doubt
suggested
by
their
compactness
of
outline
neatly
demarcated
in
insular
form
from
the
smooth
carpet
of
grass
around
them
they
are
composed
of
a
great
variety
of
trees
loaded
with
succulent
parasites
and
lashed
together
by
woody
climbers
like
the
forest
in
other
parts
a
narrow
belt
of
dense
wood
similar
in
character
to
these
ilhas
and
like
them
sharply
limited
along
its
borders
runs
everywhere
parallel
and
close
to
the
river
in
crossing
the
campo
the
path
from
the
town
ascends
a
little
for
a
mile
or
two
passing
through
this
marginal
strip
of
wood
the
grassy
land
then
slopes
gradually
to
a
broad
valley
watered
by
rivulets
whose
banks
are
clothed
with
lofty
and
luxuriant
forest
beyond
this
a
range
of
hills
extends
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
towards
the
yet
untrodden
interior
some
of
these
hills
are
long
ridges
wooded
or
bare
others
are
isolated
conical
peaks
rising
abruptly
from
the
valley
the
highest
are
probably
not
more
than
a
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
one
remarkable
hill
the
serra
de
muruaru
about
fifteen
miles
from
santarem
which
terminates
the
prospect
to
the
south
is
of
the
same
truncated
pyramidal
form
as
the
range
of
hills
near
almeyrim
complete
solitude
reigns
over
the
whole
of
this
stretch
of
beautiful
country
the
inhabitants
of
santarem
know
nothing
of
the
interior
and
seem
to
feel
little
curiosity
concerning
it
a
few
tracks
from
the
town
across
the
campo
lead
to
some
small
clearings
four
or
five
miles
off
belonging
to
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
the
place
but
excepting
these
there
are
no
roads
or
signs
of
the
proximity
of
a
civilised
settlement
the
appearance
of
the
campos
changes
very
much
according
to
the
season
there
is
not
that
grand
uniformity
of
aspect
throughout
the
year
which
is
observed
in
the
virgin
forest
and
which
makes
a
deeper
impression
on
the
naturalist
the
longer
he
remains
in
this
country
the
seasons
in
this
part
of
the
amazons
region
are
sharply
contrasted
but
the
difference
is
not
so
great
as
in
some
tropical
countries
where
during
the
dry
monsoon
insects
and
reptiles
go
into
a
summer
sleep
and
the
trees
simultaneously
shed
their
leaves
as
the
dry
season
advances
august
september
the
grass
on
the
campos
withers
and
the
shrubby
vegetation
near
the
town
becomes
a
mass
of
parched
yellow
stubble
the
period
however
is
not
one
of
general
torpidity
or
repose
for
animal
or
vegetable
life
birds
certainly
are
not
so
numerous
as
in
the
wet
season
but
some
kinds
remain
and
lay
their
eggs
at
this
time
for
instance
the
ground
doves
chamaepelia
the
trees
retain
their
verdure
throughout
and
many
of
them
flower
in
the
dry
months
lizards
do
not
become
torpid
and
insects
are
seen
both
in
the
larva
and
the
perfect
states
showing
that
the
aridity
of
the
climate
has
not
a
general
influence
on
the
development
of
the
species
some
kinds
of
butterflies
especially
the
little
hairstreaks
theclae
whose
caterpillars
feed
on
the
trees
make
their
appearance
only
when
the
dry
season
is
at
its
height
the
land
molluscs
of
the
district
are
the
only
animals
which
aestivate
they
are
found
in
clusters
bulimi
and
helices
concealed
in
hollow
trees
the
mouths
of
their
shells
closed
by
a
film
of
mucus
the
fine
weather
breaks
up
often
with
great
suddenness
about
the
beginning
of
february
violent
squalls
from
the
west
or
the
opposite
direction
to
the
then
occur
they
give
very
little
warning
and
the
first
generally
catches
the
people
unprepared
they
fall
in
the
night
and
blowing
directly
into
the
harbour
with
the
first
gust
sweep
all
vessels
from
their
anchorage
in
a
few
minutes
a
mass
of
canoes
large
and
small
including
schooners
of
fifty
tons
burthen
are
clashing
together
mell
on
the
beach
i
have
reason
to
remember
these
storms
for
i
was
once
caught
in
onemyself
while
crossing
the
river
in
an
undecked
boat
about
a
day
journey
from
santarem
they
are
accompanied
with
terrific
electric
explosions
the
sharp
claps
of
thunder
falling
almost
simultaneously
with
the
blinding
flashes
of
lightning
torrents
of
rain
follow
the
first
outbreak
the
wind
then
gradually
abates
and
the
rain
subsides
into
a
steady
drizzle
which
continues
often
for
the
greater
part
of
the
succeeding
day
after
a
week
or
two
of
showery
weather
the
aspect
of
the
country
is
completely
changed
the
parched
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
of
santarem
breaks
out
so
to
speak
in
a
rash
of
greenery
the
dusty
languishing
trees
gain
without
having
shed
their
old
leaves
a
new
clothing
of
tender
green
foliage
a
wonderful
variety
of
leguminous
plants
springs
up
and
leafy
creepers
overrun
the
ground
the
bushes
and
the
trunks
of
trees
one
is
reminded
of
the
sudden
advent
of
spring
after
a
few
warm
showers
in
northern
climates
i
was
the
more
struck
by
it
as
nothing
similar
is
witnessed
in
the
virgin
forests
amongst
which
i
had
passed
the
four
years
previous
to
my
stay
in
this
part
the
grass
on
the
campos
is
renewed
and
many
of
the
campo
trees
especially
the
myrtles
which
grow
abundantly
in
one
portion
of
the
district
begin
to
flower
attracting
by
the
fragrance
of
their
blossoms
a
great
number
and
variety
of
insects
more
particularly
coleoptera
many
kinds
of
birds
parrots
toucans
and
barbets
which
live
habitually
in
the
forest
then
visit
the
open
places
a
few
weeks
of
comparatively
dry
weather
generally
intervene
in
march
after
a
month
or
two
of
rain
the
heaviest
rains
fall
in
april
may
and
june
they
come
in
a
succession
of
showers
with
sunny
gleamy
weather
in
the
intervals
june
and
july
are
the
months
when
the
leafy
luxuriance
of
the
campos
and
the
activity
of
life
are
at
their
highest
most
birds
have
then
completed
their
moulting
which
extends
over
the
period
from
february
to
may
the
flowering
shrubs
are
then
mostly
in
bloom
and
numberless
kinds
of
dipterous
and
hymenopterous
insects
appear
simultaneously
with
the
flowers
this
season
might
be
considered
the
equivalent
of
summer
in
temperate
climates
as
the
bursting
forth
of
the
foliage
in
february
represents
the
spring
but
under
the
equator
there
is
not
that
simultaneous
march
in
the
annual
life
of
animals
and
plants
which
we
see
in
high
latitudes
some
species
it
is
true
are
dependent
upon
others
in
their
periodical
acts
of
life
and
go
with
them
but
they
are
not
all
simultaneously
and
similarly
affected
by
the
physical
changes
of
the
seasons
i
will
now
give
an
account
of
some
of
my
favourite
collecting
places
in
the
neighbourhood
of
santarem
incorporating
with
the
description
a
few
of
the
more
interesting
observations
made
on
the
natural
history
of
the
localities
to
the
west
of
the
town
there
was
a
pleasant
path
along
the
beach
to
a
little
bay
called
mapiri
about
five
miles
within
the
mouth
of
the
tapajos
the
road
was
practicable
only
in
the
dry
season
the
river
at
santarem
rises
on
the
average
about
thirty
feet
varying
in
different
years
about
ten
feet
so
that
in
the
four
months
from
april
to
july
the
water
comes
up
to
the
edge
of
the
marginal
belt
of
wood
already
spoken
of
this
mapiri
excursion
was
most
pleasant
and
profitable
in
the
months
from
january
to
march
before
the
rains
became
too
continuous
the
sandy
beach
beyond
the
town
is
very
irregular
in
some
places
forming
long
spits
on
which
when
the
east
wind
is
blowing
the
waves
break
in
a
line
of
foam
at
others
receding
to
shape
out
quiet
little
bays
and
pools
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
a
few
scattered
huts
of
indians
and
coloured
people
are
passed
prettily
situated
on
the
margin
of
the
white
beach
with
a
background
of
glorious
foliage
the
cabin
of
the
pureblood
indian
being
distinguished
from
the
mud
hovels
of
the
free
negroes
and
mulattoes
by
its
light
construction
half
of
it
being
an
open
shed
where
the
dusky
tenants
are
seen
at
all
hours
of
the
day
lounging
in
their
grass
hammocks
about
two
miles
on
the
road
we
come
to
a
series
of
shallow
pools
called
the
laguinhos
which
are
connected
with
the
river
in
the
wet
season
but
separated
from
it
by
a
high
bank
of
sand
topped
with
bushes
at
other
times
there
is
a
break
here
in
the
fringe
of
wood
and
a
glimpse
is
obtained
of
the
grassy
campo
when
the
waters
have
risen
to
the
level
of
the
pools
this
place
is
frequented
by
many
kinds
of
wading
birds
egrets
of
two
species
stand
about
the
margins
of
the
water
and
striped
herons
may
be
seen
half
hidden
under
the
shade
of
the
bushes
the
pools
are
covered
with
a
small
kind
of
waterlily
and
surrounded
by
a
dense
thicket
amongst
the
birds
which
inhabit
this
spot
is
the
troupial
trupialis
gulanensis
a
bird
resembling
our
starling
in
size
and
habits
and
not
unlike
it
in
colour
with
the
exception
of
the
rich
rosy
vest
the
water
at
this
time
of
the
year
overflows
a
large
level
tract
of
campo
bordering
the
pools
and
the
troupials
come
to
feed
on
the
larvae
of
insects
which
then
abound
in
the
moist
soil
beyond
the
laguinhos
there
succeeds
a
tract
of
level
beach
covered
with
trees
which
form
a
beautiful
grove
about
the
month
of
april
when
the
water
rises
to
this
level
the
trees
are
covered
with
blossom
and
a
handsome
orchid
an
epidendron
with
large
white
flowers
which
clothes
thickly
the
trunks
is
profusely
in
bloom
several
kinds
of
kingfisher
resort
to
the
place
four
species
may
be
seen
within
a
small
space
the
largest
as
big
as
a
crow
of
a
hue
and
with
an
enormous
beak
the
smallest
not
larger
than
a
sparrow
the
large
one
makes
its
nest
in
clay
cliffs
three
or
four
miles
distant
from
this
place
none
of
the
kingfishers
are
so
brilliant
in
colour
as
our
english
species
the
blossoms
on
the
trees
attract
two
or
three
species
of
hummingbirds
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
is
a
large
kind
eupetomena
macroura
with
a
brilliant
livery
of
emerald
green
and
steel
blue
i
noticed
that
it
did
not
remain
so
long
poised
in
the
air
before
the
flowers
as
the
other
smaller
species
it
perched
more
frequently
and
sometimes
darted
after
small
insects
on
the
wing
emerging
from
the
grove
there
is
a
long
stretch
of
sandy
beach
the
land
is
high
and
rocky
and
the
belt
of
wood
which
skirts
the
river
banks
is
much
broader
than
it
is
elsewhere
at
length
after
rounding
a
projecting
bluff
the
bay
at
mapiri
is
reached
the
river
view
is
characteristic
of
the
tapajos
the
shores
are
wooded
and
on
the
opposite
side
is
a
line
of
clay
cliffs
with
hills
in
the
background
clothed
with
a
rolling
forest
a
long
spit
of
sand
extends
into
beyond
which
is
an
immense
expanse
of
dark
water
the
further
shore
of
the
tapajos
being
barely
visible
as
a
thin
grey
line
of
trees
on
the
horizon
the
transparency
of
air
and
water
in
the
dry
season
when
the
brisk
east
wind
is
blowing
and
the
sharpness
of
outline
of
hills
woods
and
sandy
beaches
give
a
great
charm
to
this
spot
while
resting
in
the
shade
during
the
great
heat
of
the
early
hours
of
afternoon
i
used
to
find
amusement
in
watching
the
proceedings
of
the
sand
wasps
a
small
pale
green
kind
of
bembex
bembex
ciliata
was
plentiful
near
the
bay
of
mapiri
when
they
are
at
work
a
number
of
little
jets
of
sand
are
seen
shooting
over
the
surface
of
the
sloping
bank
the
little
miners
excavate
with
their
forefeet
which
are
strongly
built
and
furnished
with
a
fringe
of
stiff
bristles
they
work
with
wonderful
rapidity
and
the
sand
thrown
out
beneath
their
bodies
issues
in
continuous
streams
they
are
solitary
wasps
each
female
working
on
her
own
account
after
making
a
gallery
two
or
three
inches
in
length
in
a
slanting
direction
from
the
surface
the
owner
backs
out
and
takes
a
few
turns
round
the
orifice
apparently
to
see
whether
it
is
well
made
but
in
reality
i
believe
to
take
note
of
the
locality
that
she
may
find
it
again
this
done
the
busy
workwoman
flies
away
but
returns
after
an
absence
varying
in
different
cases
from
a
few
minutes
to
an
hour
or
more
with
a
fly
in
her
grasp
with
which
she
her
mine
on
again
emerging
the
entrance
is
carefully
closed
with
sand
during
this
interval
she
has
laid
an
egg
on
the
body
of
the
fly
which
she
had
previously
benumbed
with
her
sting
and
which
is
to
serve
as
food
for
the
soft
footless
grub
soon
to
be
hatched
from
the
egg
from
what
i
could
make
out
the
bembex
makes
a
fresh
excavation
for
every
egg
to
be
deposited
at
least
in
two
or
three
of
the
galleries
which
i
opened
there
was
only
one
fly
enclosed
i
have
said
that
the
bembex
on
leaving
her
mine
took
note
of
the
locality
this
seemed
to
be
the
explanation
of
the
short
delay
previous
to
her
taking
flight
on
rising
in
the
air
also
the
insects
generally
flew
round
over
the
place
before
making
straight
off
another
nearly
allied
but
much
larger
species
the
monedula
signata
whose
habits
i
observed
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
amazons
sometimes
excavates
its
mine
solitarily
on
banks
recently
laid
bare
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
closes
the
orifice
before
going
in
search
of
prey
in
these
cases
the
insect
has
to
make
a
journey
of
at
least
half
a
mile
to
procure
the
kind
of
fly
the
motuca
hadrus
lepidotus
with
which
it
provisions
its
cell
i
often
noticed
it
to
take
a
few
turns
in
the
air
round
the
place
before
starting
on
its
return
it
made
without
hesitation
straight
for
the
closed
mouth
of
the
mine
i
was
convinced
that
the
insects
noted
the
bearings
of
their
nests
and
the
direction
they
took
in
flying
from
them
the
proceeding
in
this
and
similar
cases
i
have
read
of
something
analogous
having
been
noticed
in
hive
bees
seems
to
be
a
mental
act
of
the
same
nature
as
that
which
takes
place
in
ourselves
when
recognising
a
locality
the
senses
however
must
be
immeasurably
more
keen
and
the
mental
operation
much
more
certain
in
them
than
it
is
in
man
for
to
my
eye
there
was
absolutely
no
landmark
on
the
even
surface
of
sand
which
could
serve
as
guide
and
the
borders
of
the
forest
were
not
nearer
than
half
a
mile
the
action
of
the
wasp
would
be
said
to
be
instinctive
but
it
seems
plain
that
the
instinct
is
no
mysterious
and
unintelligible
agent
but
a
mental
process
in
each
individual
differing
from
the
same
in
man
only
by
its
unerring
certainty
the
mind
of
the
insect
appears
to
be
so
constituted
that
the
impression
of
external
objects
or
the
want
felt
causes
it
to
act
with
a
precision
which
seems
to
us
like
that
of
a
machine
constructed
to
move
in
a
certain
given
way
i
have
noticed
in
indian
boys
a
sense
of
locality
almost
as
keen
as
that
possessed
by
the
wasp
an
old
portuguese
and
myself
accompanied
by
a
young
lad
about
ten
years
of
age
were
once
lost
in
the
forest
in
a
most
solitary
place
on
the
banks
of
the
main
river
our
case
seemed
hopeless
and
it
did
not
for
some
time
occur
to
us
to
consult
our
little
companion
who
had
been
playing
with
his
bow
and
arrow
all
the
way
while
we
were
hunting
apparently
taking
no
note
of
the
route
when
asked
however
he
pointed
out
in
a
moment
the
right
direction
of
our
canoe
he
could
not
explain
how
he
knew
i
believe
he
had
noted
the
course
we
had
taken
almost
unconsciously
the
sense
of
locality
in
his
case
seemed
instinctive
the
monedula
signata
is
a
good
friend
to
travellers
in
those
parts
of
the
amazons
which
are
infested
by
the
motuca
i
first
noticed
its
habit
of
preying
on
this
fly
one
day
when
we
landed
to
make
our
fire
and
dine
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
adjoining
a
the
insect
is
as
large
as
a
hornet
and
has
a
most
waspish
appearance
i
was
rather
startled
when
one
out
of
the
flock
which
was
hovering
about
us
flew
straight
at
my
face
it
had
espied
a
motuca
on
my
neck
and
was
thus
pouncing
upon
it
it
seizes
the
fly
not
with
its
jaws
but
with
its
fore
and
middle
feet
and
carries
it
off
tightly
held
to
its
breast
wherever
the
traveller
lands
on
the
upper
amazons
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
he
is
sure
to
be
attended
by
one
or
more
of
these
useful
the
bay
of
mapiri
was
the
limit
of
my
day
excursions
by
the
to
the
west
of
santarem
a
person
may
travel
however
on
foot
as
indians
frequently
do
in
the
dry
season
for
fifty
or
sixty
miles
along
the
broad
clean
sandy
beaches
of
the
tapajos
the
only
obstacles
are
the
rivulets
most
of
which
are
fordable
when
the
waters
are
low
to
the
east
my
rambles
extended
to
the
banks
of
the
mahica
inlet
this
enters
the
amazons
about
three
miles
below
santarem
where
the
clear
stream
of
the
tapajos
begins
to
be
discoloured
by
the
turbid
waters
of
the
main
river
the
mahica
has
a
broad
margin
of
rich
level
pasture
limited
on
each
side
by
the
straight
tall
hedge
of
forest
on
the
santarem
side
it
is
skirted
by
high
wooded
ridges
a
landscape
of
this
description
always
produced
in
me
an
impression
of
sadness
and
loneliness
which
the
luxuriant
virgin
forests
that
closely
hedge
in
most
of
the
of
the
amazons
never
created
the
pastures
are
destitute
of
flowers
and
also
of
animal
life
with
the
exception
of
a
few
small
birds
and
solitary
caracara
eagles
whining
from
the
topmost
branches
of
dead
trees
on
the
forest
borders
a
few
settlers
have
built
their
thatched
and
huts
on
the
banks
of
the
mahica
and
occupy
themselves
chiefly
in
tending
small
herds
of
cattle
they
seemed
to
be
all
wretchedly
poor
the
oxen
however
though
small
were
sleek
and
fat
and
the
district
most
promising
for
agricultural
and
pastoral
employments
in
the
wet
season
the
waters
gradually
rise
and
cover
the
meadows
but
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
the
removal
of
the
cattle
to
higher
ground
the
lazy
and
ignorant
people
seem
totally
unable
to
profit
by
these
advantages
the
houses
have
no
gardens
or
plantations
near
them
i
was
told
it
was
useless
to
plant
anything
because
the
cattle
devoured
the
young
shoots
in
this
country
grazing
and
planting
are
very
rarely
carried
on
together
for
the
people
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
enclosing
patches
of
ground
for
cultivation
they
say
it
is
too
much
trouble
to
make
enclosures
the
construction
of
a
durable
fence
is
certainly
a
difficult
matter
for
it
is
only
two
or
three
kinds
of
tree
which
will
serve
the
purpose
in
being
free
from
the
attacks
of
insects
and
these
are
scattered
far
and
wide
through
the
woods
although
the
meadows
were
unproductive
ground
to
a
naturalist
the
woods
on
their
borders
teemed
with
life
the
number
and
variety
of
curious
insects
of
all
orders
which
occurred
here
was
quite
wonderful
the
belt
of
forest
was
intersected
by
numerous
pathways
leading
from
one
settler
house
to
another
the
ground
was
moist
but
the
trees
were
not
so
lofty
or
their
crowns
so
densely
packed
together
as
in
other
parts
the
sun
light
and
heat
therefore
had
freer
access
to
the
soil
and
the
underwood
was
much
more
diversified
than
in
the
virgin
forest
i
never
saw
so
many
kinds
of
dwarf
palms
together
as
here
pretty
miniature
species
some
not
more
than
five
feet
high
and
bearing
little
clusters
of
round
fruit
not
larger
than
a
good
bunch
of
currants
a
few
of
the
forest
trees
had
the
size
and
figures
of
our
oaks
and
a
similar
bark
one
noble
palm
grew
here
in
great
abundance
and
gave
a
distinctive
character
to
the
district
this
was
the
oenocarpus
distichus
one
of
the
kinds
called
bacaba
by
the
natives
it
grows
to
a
height
of
forty
to
fifty
feet
the
crown
is
of
a
lustrous
colour
and
of
a
singularly
flattened
or
compressed
shape
the
leaves
being
arranged
on
each
side
in
nearly
the
same
plane
when
i
first
saw
this
tree
on
the
campos
where
the
east
wind
blows
with
great
force
night
and
day
for
several
months
i
thought
the
shape
of
the
crown
was
due
to
the
leaves
being
prevented
from
radiating
equally
by
the
constant
action
of
the
breezes
but
the
plane
of
growth
is
not
always
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
the
crown
has
the
same
shape
when
the
tree
grows
in
the
sheltered
woods
the
fruit
of
this
fine
palm
ripens
towards
the
end
of
the
year
and
is
much
esteemed
by
the
natives
who
manufacture
a
pleasant
drink
from
it
similar
to
the
assai
described
in
a
former
chapter
by
rubbing
off
the
coat
of
pulp
from
the
nuts
and
mixing
it
with
water
a
bunch
of
fruit
weighs
thirty
or
forty
pounds
the
beverage
has
a
milky
appearance
and
an
agreeable
nutty
flavour
the
tree
is
very
difficult
to
climb
on
account
of
the
smoothness
of
its
stein
consequently
the
natives
whenever
they
want
a
bunch
of
fruit
for
a
bowl
of
bacaba
cut
down
and
thus
destroy
a
tree
which
has
taken
a
score
or
two
of
years
to
grow
in
order
to
get
at
it
in
the
lower
part
of
the
mahica
woods
towards
the
river
there
is
a
bed
of
stiff
white
clay
which
supplies
the
people
of
santarem
with
material
for
the
manufacture
of
coarse
pottery
and
cooking
utensils
all
the
kettles
saucepans
mandioca
ovens
and
so
forth
of
the
poorer
classes
throughout
the
country
are
made
of
this
same
plastic
clay
which
occurs
at
short
intervals
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
amazons
valley
from
the
neighbourhood
of
para
to
within
the
peruvian
borders
and
forms
part
of
the
great
tabatinga
marl
deposit
to
enable
the
vessels
to
stand
the
fire
the
bark
of
a
certain
tree
called
caraipe
is
burned
and
mixed
with
the
clay
which
gives
tenacity
to
the
ware
caraipe
is
an
article
of
commerce
being
sold
and
packed
in
baskets
at
the
shops
in
most
of
the
towns
the
shallow
pits
excavated
in
the
marly
soil
at
mahica
were
very
attractive
to
many
kinds
of
mason
bees
and
wasps
who
made
use
of
the
clay
to
build
their
nests
with
so
we
have
here
another
example
of
the
curious
analogy
that
exists
between
the
arts
of
insects
and
those
of
man
i
spent
many
an
hour
watching
their
proceedings
a
short
account
of
the
habits
of
some
of
these
busy
creatures
may
be
interesting
the
most
conspicuous
was
a
large
yellow
and
black
wasp
with
a
remarkably
long
and
narrow
waist
the
pelopaeus
fistularis
this
species
collected
the
clay
in
little
round
pellets
which
it
carried
off
after
rolling
them
into
a
convenient
shape
in
its
mouth
it
came
straight
to
the
pit
with
a
loud
hum
and
on
alighting
lost
not
a
moment
in
beginning
to
work
finishing
the
kneading
of
its
little
load
in
two
or
three
minutes
the
nest
of
this
wasp
is
shaped
like
a
pouch
two
inches
in
length
and
is
attached
to
a
branch
or
other
projecting
object
one
of
these
restless
artificers
once
began
to
build
on
the
handle
of
a
chest
in
the
cabin
of
my
canoe
when
we
were
stationary
at
a
place
for
several
days
it
was
so
intent
on
its
work
that
it
allowed
me
to
inspect
the
movements
of
its
mouth
with
a
lens
while
it
was
laying
on
the
mortar
every
fresh
pellet
was
brought
in
with
a
triumphant
song
which
changed
to
a
cheerful
busy
hum
when
it
alighted
and
began
to
work
the
little
ball
of
moist
clay
was
laid
on
the
edge
of
the
cell
and
then
spread
out
around
the
circular
rim
by
means
of
the
lower
lip
guided
by
the
mandibles
the
insect
placed
itself
astride
over
the
rim
to
work
and
on
finishing
each
addition
to
the
structure
took
a
turn
round
patting
the
sides
with
its
feet
inside
and
out
before
flying
off
to
gather
a
fresh
pellet
it
worked
only
in
sunny
weather
and
the
previous
layer
was
sometimes
not
quite
dry
when
the
new
coating
was
added
the
whole
structure
takes
about
a
week
to
complete
i
left
the
place
before
the
gay
little
builder
had
quite
finished
her
task
she
did
not
accompany
the
canoe
although
we
moved
along
the
bank
of
the
river
very
slowly
on
opening
closed
nests
of
this
species
which
are
common
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mahica
i
always
found
them
to
be
stocked
with
small
spiders
of
the
genus
gastracantha
in
the
usual
state
to
which
the
mother
wasps
reduce
the
insects
which
are
to
serve
as
food
for
their
progeny
besides
the
pelopaeus
there
were
three
or
four
kinds
of
trypoxylon
a
genus
also
found
in
europe
and
which
some
naturalists
have
supposed
to
be
parasitic
because
the
legs
are
not
furnished
with
the
usual
row
of
strong
bristles
for
digging
characteristic
of
the
family
to
which
it
belongs
the
species
of
trypoxylon
however
are
all
building
wasps
two
of
them
which
i
observed
albitarse
and
an
undescribed
species
provision
their
nests
with
spiders
a
third
aurifrons
with
small
caterpillars
their
habits
are
similar
to
those
of
the
namely
they
carry
off
the
clay
in
their
mandibles
and
have
a
different
song
when
they
hasten
away
with
the
burden
to
that
which
they
sing
whilst
at
work
trypoxylon
albitarse
which
is
a
large
black
kind
of
an
inch
in
length
makes
a
tremendous
fuss
while
building
its
cell
it
often
chooses
the
walls
or
doors
of
chambers
for
this
purpose
and
when
two
or
three
are
at
work
in
the
same
place
their
loud
humming
keeps
the
house
in
an
uproar
the
cell
is
a
tubular
structure
about
three
inches
in
length
aurifrons
a
much
smaller
species
makes
a
neat
little
nest
shaped
like
a
carafe
building
rows
of
them
together
in
the
corners
of
verandahs
but
the
most
numerous
and
interesting
of
the
clay
artificers
are
the
workers
of
a
species
of
social
bee
the
melipona
fasciculata
the
meliponae
in
tropical
america
take
the
place
of
the
true
apides
to
which
the
european
belongs
and
which
are
here
unknown
they
are
generally
much
smaller
insects
than
the
and
have
no
sting
the
fasciculata
is
about
a
third
shorter
than
the
apis
mellifica
its
colonies
are
composed
of
an
immense
number
of
individuals
the
workers
are
generally
seen
collecting
pollen
in
the
same
way
as
other
bees
but
great
numbers
are
employed
gathering
clay
the
rapidity
and
precision
of
their
movements
while
thus
engaged
are
wonderful
they
first
scrape
the
clay
with
their
jaws
the
small
portions
gathered
are
then
cleared
by
the
anterior
paws
and
passed
to
the
second
pair
of
feet
which
in
their
turn
convey
them
to
the
large
foliated
expansions
of
the
hind
shanks
which
are
adapted
normally
in
bees
as
every
one
knows
for
the
collection
of
pollen
the
middle
feet
pat
the
growing
pellets
of
mortar
on
the
hind
legs
to
keep
them
in
a
compact
shape
as
the
particles
are
successively
added
the
little
hodsmen
soon
have
as
much
as
they
can
carry
and
they
then
fly
off
i
was
for
some
time
puzzled
to
know
what
the
bees
did
with
the
clay
but
i
had
afterwards
plenty
of
opportunity
for
ascertaining
they
construct
their
combs
in
any
suitable
crevice
in
trunks
of
trees
or
perpendicular
banks
and
the
clay
is
required
to
build
up
a
wall
so
as
to
close
the
gap
with
the
exception
of
a
small
orifice
for
their
own
entrance
and
exit
most
kinds
of
meliponae
are
in
this
way
masons
as
well
as
workers
in
wax
and
one
little
species
undescribed
not
more
than
two
lines
long
builds
a
neat
tubular
gallery
of
clay
kneaded
with
some
viscid
substance
outside
the
entrance
to
its
hive
besides
blocking
up
the
crevice
in
the
tree
within
which
it
is
situated
the
mouth
of
the
tube
is
and
at
the
entrance
a
number
of
pigmy
bees
are
always
stationed
apparently
acting
as
the
sentinels
a
hive
of
the
melipona
fasciculata
which
i
saw
opened
contained
about
two
quarts
of
liquid
honey
the
bees
as
already
remarked
have
no
sting
but
they
bite
furiously
when
their
colonies
are
disturbed
the
indian
who
plundered
the
hive
was
completely
covered
by
them
they
took
a
particular
fancy
to
the
hair
of
his
head
and
fastened
on
it
by
hundreds
i
found
species
of
these
bees
in
different
parts
of
the
country
the
largest
was
half
an
inch
in
length
the
smallest
were
extremely
minute
some
kinds
being
not
more
than
of
an
inch
in
size
these
tiny
fellows
are
often
very
troublesome
in
the
woods
on
account
of
their
familiarity
for
they
settle
on
one
face
and
hands
and
in
crawling
about
get
into
the
eyes
and
mouth
or
up
the
nostrils
the
broad
expansion
of
the
hind
shanks
of
bees
is
applied
in
some
species
to
other
uses
besides
the
conveyance
of
clay
and
pollen
the
female
of
the
handsome
golden
and
black
euglossa
surinamensis
has
this
palette
of
very
large
size
this
species
builds
its
solitary
nest
also
in
crevices
of
walls
or
trees
but
it
closes
up
the
chink
with
fragments
of
dried
leaves
and
sticks
cemented
together
instead
of
clay
it
visits
the
caju
trees
and
gathers
with
its
hind
legs
a
small
quantity
of
the
gum
which
exudes
from
their
trunks
to
this
it
adds
the
other
materials
required
from
the
neighbouring
bushes
and
when
laden
flies
off
to
its
nest
to
the
south
my
rambles
never
extended
further
than
the
banks
of
the
irura
a
stream
which
rises
amongst
the
hills
already
spoken
of
and
running
through
a
broad
valley
wooded
along
the
margins
of
the
watercourses
falls
into
the
tapajos
at
the
head
of
the
bay
of
mapiri
all
beyond
as
before
remarked
is
terra
incognita
to
the
inhabitants
of
santarem
the
brazilian
settlers
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
seem
to
have
no
taste
for
explorations
by
land
and
i
could
find
no
person
willing
to
accompany
me
on
an
excursion
further
towards
the
interior
such
a
journey
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
in
this
country
even
if
men
could
be
obtained
willing
to
undertake
it
besides
there
were
reports
of
a
settlement
of
fierce
runaway
negroes
on
the
serra
de
mururaru
and
it
was
considered
unsafe
to
go
far
in
that
direction
except
with
a
large
armed
party
i
visited
the
banks
of
the
irura
and
the
rich
woods
accompanying
it
and
two
other
streams
in
the
same
neighbourhood
one
called
the
panema
and
the
other
the
urumari
once
or
twice
a
week
during
the
whole
time
of
my
residence
in
santarem
and
made
large
collections
of
their
natural
productions
these
forest
brooks
with
their
clear
cold
waters
brawling
over
their
sandy
or
pebbly
beds
through
wild
tropical
glens
always
had
a
great
charm
for
me
the
beauty
of
the
moist
cool
and
luxuriant
glades
was
heightened
by
the
contrast
they
afforded
to
the
sterile
country
around
them
the
bare
or
scantily
wooded
hills
which
surround
the
valley
are
parched
by
the
rays
of
the
vertical
sun
one
of
them
the
pico
do
irura
forms
a
nearly
perfect
cone
rising
from
a
small
grassy
plain
to
a
height
of
or
feet
and
its
ascent
is
excessively
fatiguing
after
the
long
walk
from
santarem
over
the
campos
i
tried
it
one
day
but
did
not
reach
the
summit
a
dense
growth
of
coarse
grasses
clothed
the
steep
sides
of
the
hill
with
here
and
there
a
stunted
tree
of
kinds
found
in
the
plain
beneath
in
bared
places
a
red
crumbly
soil
is
exposed
and
in
one
part
a
mass
of
rock
which
appeared
to
me
from
its
compact
texture
and
the
absence
of
stratification
to
be
porphyritic
but
i
am
not
geologically
sufficient
to
pronounce
on
such
questions
wallace
states
that
he
found
fragments
of
scoriae
and
believes
the
hill
to
be
a
volcanic
cone
to
the
south
and
east
of
this
isolated
peak
the
elongated
ridges
or
hills
attain
a
somewhat
greater
elevation
the
forest
in
the
valley
is
limited
to
a
tract
a
few
hundred
yards
in
width
on
each
side
the
different
streams
in
places
where
these
run
along
the
bases
of
the
hills
the
hillsides
facing
the
water
are
also
richly
wooded
although
their
opposite
declivities
are
bare
or
nearly
so
the
trees
are
lofty
and
of
great
variety
amongst
them
are
colossal
examples
of
the
brazil
nut
tree
bertholletia
excelsa
and
the
pikia
this
latter
bears
a
large
eatable
fruit
curious
in
having
a
hollow
chamber
between
the
pulp
and
the
kernel
beset
with
hard
spines
which
produce
serious
wounds
if
they
enter
the
skin
the
eatable
part
appeared
to
me
not
much
more
palatable
than
a
raw
potato
but
the
inhabitants
of
santarem
are
very
fond
of
it
and
undertake
the
most
toilsome
journeys
on
foot
to
gather
a
basketful
the
tree
which
yields
the
tonka
bean
dipteryx
odorata
used
in
europe
for
scenting
snuff
is
also
of
frequent
occurrence
here
it
grows
to
an
immense
height
and
the
fruit
which
although
a
legume
is
of
a
rounded
shape
and
has
but
one
seed
can
be
gathered
only
when
it
falls
to
the
ground
a
considerable
quantity
from
to
pounds
is
exported
annually
from
santarem
the
produce
of
the
whole
region
of
the
tapajos
an
endless
diversity
of
trees
and
shrubs
some
beautiful
in
flower
and
foliage
others
bearing
curious
fruits
grow
in
this
matted
wilderness
it
would
be
tedious
to
enumerate
many
of
them
i
was
much
struck
with
the
variety
of
trees
with
large
and
fruits
growing
out
of
the
trunk
and
branches
some
within
a
few
inches
of
the
ground
like
the
cacao
most
of
them
are
called
by
the
natives
cupu
and
the
trees
are
of
inconsiderable
height
one
of
them
called
bears
a
fruit
of
elliptical
shape
and
of
a
dingy
earthen
colour
six
or
seven
inches
long
the
shell
of
which
is
woody
and
thin
and
contains
a
small
number
of
seeds
loosely
enveloped
in
a
juicy
pulp
of
very
pleasant
flavour
the
fruits
hang
like
clayey
from
the
branches
another
kind
more
nearly
resembles
the
cacao
this
is
shaped
something
like
the
cucumber
and
has
a
green
ribbed
husk
it
bears
the
name
of
cacao
de
macaco
or
monkey
chocolate
but
the
seeds
are
smaller
than
those
of
the
common
cacao
i
tried
once
or
twice
to
make
chocolate
from
them
they
contain
plenty
of
oil
of
similar
fragrance
to
that
of
the
ordinary
and
make
up
very
well
into
paste
but
the
beverage
has
a
repulsive
clayey
colour
and
an
inferior
flavour
my
excursions
to
the
irura
had
always
a
picnic
character
a
few
rude
huts
are
scattered
through
the
valley
but
they
are
tenanted
only
for
a
few
days
in
the
year
when
their
owners
come
to
gather
and
roast
the
mandioca
of
their
small
clearings
we
used
generally
to
take
with
us
two
boys
one
negro
the
other
indian
to
carry
our
provisions
for
the
day
a
few
pounds
of
beef
or
dried
fish
farinha
and
bananas
with
plates
and
a
kettle
for
cooking
jose
carried
the
guns
ammunition
and
and
i
the
apparatus
for
entomologising
the
insect
net
a
large
leathern
bag
with
compartments
for
corked
boxes
phials
glass
tubes
and
so
forth
it
was
our
custom
to
start
soon
after
sunrise
when
the
walk
over
the
campos
was
cool
and
pleasant
the
sky
without
a
cloud
and
the
grass
wet
with
dew
the
paths
are
mere
faint
tracks
in
our
early
excursions
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
missing
our
way
we
were
once
completely
lost
and
wandered
about
for
several
hours
over
the
scorching
soil
without
recovering
the
road
a
fine
view
is
obtained
of
the
country
from
the
rising
ground
about
half
way
across
the
waste
thence
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
a
long
gentle
grassy
slope
bare
of
trees
the
hills
the
forest
at
their
feet
richly
varied
with
palms
the
bay
of
mapiri
on
the
right
with
the
dark
waters
of
the
tapajos
and
its
white
glistening
shores
are
all
spread
out
before
one
as
if
depicted
on
canvas
the
extreme
transparency
of
the
atmosphere
gives
to
all
parts
of
the
landscape
such
clearness
of
outline
that
the
idea
of
distance
is
destroyed
and
one
fancies
the
whole
to
be
almost
within
reach
of
the
hand
descending
into
the
valley
a
small
brook
has
to
be
crossed
and
then
half
a
mile
of
sandy
plain
whose
vegetation
wears
a
peculiar
aspect
owing
to
the
predominance
of
a
stemless
palm
the
curua
attalea
spectabilis
whose
large
beautifully
pinnated
rigid
leaves
rise
directly
from
the
soil
the
fruit
of
this
species
is
similar
to
the
coconut
containing
milk
in
the
interior
of
the
kernel
but
it
is
much
inferior
to
it
in
size
here
and
indeed
all
along
the
road
we
saw
on
most
days
in
the
wet
season
tracks
of
the
jaguar
we
never
however
met
with
the
animal
although
we
sometimes
heard
his
loud
hough
in
the
night
while
lying
in
our
hammocks
at
home
in
santarem
and
knew
he
must
be
lurking
somewhere
near
us
my
best
hunting
ground
was
a
part
of
the
valley
sheltered
on
one
side
by
a
steep
hill
whose
declivity
like
the
swampy
valley
beneath
was
clothed
with
magnificent
forest
we
used
to
make
our
halt
in
a
small
cleared
place
tolerably
free
from
ants
and
close
to
the
water
here
we
assembled
after
our
toilsome
morning
hunt
in
different
directions
through
the
woods
took
our
meal
on
the
ground
two
broad
leaves
of
the
wild
banana
serving
us
for
a
tablecloth
and
rested
for
a
couple
of
hours
during
the
great
heat
of
the
afternoon
the
diversity
of
animal
productions
was
as
wonderful
as
that
of
the
vegetable
forms
in
this
rich
locality
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
down
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
when
my
people
lay
asleep
and
watch
the
movements
of
animals
sometimes
a
troop
of
anus
crotophaga
a
glossy
plumaged
bird
which
lives
in
small
societies
in
grassy
places
would
come
in
from
the
campos
one
by
one
calling
to
each
other
as
they
moved
from
tree
to
tree
or
a
toucan
rhamphastos
ariel
silently
hopped
or
ran
along
and
up
the
branches
peeping
into
chinks
and
crevices
notes
of
solitary
birds
resounded
from
a
distance
through
the
wilderness
occasionally
a
sulky
trogon
would
be
seen
with
its
brilliant
green
back
and
breast
perched
for
an
hour
without
moving
on
a
low
branch
a
number
of
large
fat
lizards
two
feet
long
of
a
kind
called
by
the
natives
jacuaru
teius
teguexim
were
always
observed
in
the
still
hours
of
midday
scampering
with
great
clatter
over
the
dead
leaves
apparently
in
chase
of
each
other
the
fat
of
this
bulky
lizard
is
much
prized
by
the
natives
who
apply
it
as
a
poultice
to
draw
palm
spines
or
even
grains
of
shot
from
the
flesh
other
lizards
of
repulsive
aspect
about
three
feet
in
length
when
full
grown
splashed
about
and
swam
in
the
water
sometimes
emerging
to
crawl
into
hollow
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
where
i
once
found
a
female
and
a
nest
of
eggs
the
lazy
flapping
flight
of
large
blue
and
black
morpho
butterflies
high
in
the
air
the
hum
of
insects
and
many
inanimate
sounds
contributed
their
share
to
the
total
impression
this
strange
solitude
produced
heavy
fruits
from
the
crowns
of
trees
which
were
mingled
together
at
a
giddy
height
overhead
fell
now
and
then
with
a
startling
plop
into
the
water
the
breeze
not
felt
below
stirred
in
the
topmost
branches
setting
the
twisted
and
looped
sipos
in
motion
which
creaked
and
groaned
in
a
great
variety
of
notes
to
these
noises
were
added
the
monotonous
ripple
of
the
brook
which
had
its
little
cascade
at
every
score
or
two
yards
of
its
course
we
frequently
fell
in
with
an
old
indian
woman
named
cecilia
who
had
a
small
clearing
in
the
woods
she
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
witch
feiticeira
and
i
found
on
talking
with
her
that
she
prided
herself
on
her
knowledge
of
the
black
art
her
slightly
curled
hair
showed
that
she
was
not
a
pureblood
indian
i
was
told
her
father
was
a
dark
mulatto
she
was
always
very
civil
to
our
party
showing
us
the
best
paths
explaining
the
virtues
and
uses
of
different
plants
and
so
forth
i
was
much
amused
at
the
accounts
she
gave
of
the
place
her
solitary
life
and
the
gloom
of
the
woods
seemed
to
have
filled
her
with
superstitious
fancies
she
said
gold
was
contained
in
the
bed
of
the
brook
and
that
the
murmur
of
the
water
over
the
little
cascades
was
the
voice
of
the
revealing
the
hidden
treasure
a
narrow
pass
between
two
hillsides
was
the
portao
or
gate
and
all
within
along
the
wooded
banks
of
the
stream
was
enchanted
ground
the
hill
underneath
which
we
were
encamped
was
the
enchanter
abode
and
she
gravely
told
us
she
often
had
long
conversations
with
him
these
myths
were
of
her
own
invention
and
in
the
same
way
an
endless
number
of
other
similar
ones
have
originated
in
the
childish
imaginations
of
the
poor
indian
and
inhabitants
of
different
parts
of
the
country
it
is
to
be
remarked
however
that
the
indian
men
all
become
sceptics
after
a
little
intercourse
with
the
whites
the
witchcraft
of
poor
cecilia
was
of
a
very
weak
quality
it
consisted
of
throwing
pinches
of
powdered
bark
of
a
certain
tree
and
other
substances
into
the
fire
while
muttering
a
spell
a
prayer
repeated
backwards
and
adding
the
name
of
the
person
on
whom
she
wished
the
incantation
to
operate
some
of
the
feiticeiras
however
play
more
dangerous
tricks
than
this
harmless
mummery
they
are
acquainted
with
many
poisonous
plants
and
although
they
seldom
have
the
courage
to
administer
a
fatal
dose
sometimes
contrive
to
convey
to
their
victim
sufficient
to
cause
serious
illness
the
motive
by
which
they
are
actuated
is
usually
jealousy
of
other
women
in
love
matters
while
i
resided
in
santarem
a
case
of
what
was
called
witchcraft
was
tried
by
the
in
which
a
highly
respectable
white
lady
was
the
complainant
it
appeared
that
some
feiticeira
had
sprinkled
a
quantity
of
the
acrid
juice
of
a
large
arum
on
her
linen
as
it
was
hanging
out
to
dry
and
it
was
thought
this
had
caused
a
serious
eruption
under
which
the
lady
suffered
i
seldom
met
with
any
of
the
larger
animals
in
these
excursions
we
never
saw
a
mammal
of
any
kind
on
the
campos
but
tracks
of
three
species
were
seen
occasionally
besides
those
of
the
jaguar
these
belonged
to
a
small
tiger
cat
a
deer
and
an
opossum
all
of
which
animals
must
have
been
very
rare
and
probably
nocturnal
in
their
habits
with
the
exception
of
the
deer
i
saw
in
the
woods
on
one
occasion
a
small
flock
of
monkeys
and
once
had
an
opportunity
of
watching
the
movements
of
a
sloth
the
latter
was
of
the
kind
called
by
cuvier
bradypus
tridactylus
which
is
clothed
with
shaggy
grey
hair
the
natives
call
it
in
the
tupi
language
al
ybyrete
in
portuguese
preguica
da
terra
firme
or
sloth
of
the
mainland
to
distinguish
it
from
the
bradypus
infuscatus
which
has
a
long
black
and
tawny
stripe
between
the
shoulders
and
is
called
al
ygapo
preguica
das
vargens
or
sloth
of
the
flooded
lands
some
travellers
in
south
america
have
described
the
sloth
as
very
nimble
in
its
native
woods
and
have
disputed
the
justness
of
the
name
which
has
been
bestowed
upon
it
the
inhabitants
of
the
amazons
region
however
both
indians
and
descendants
of
the
portuguese
hold
to
the
common
opinion
and
consider
the
sloth
as
the
type
of
laziness
it
is
very
common
for
one
native
to
call
another
in
reproaching
him
for
idleness
bicho
do
embauba
beast
of
the
cecropia
tree
the
leaves
of
the
cecropia
being
the
food
of
the
sloth
it
is
a
strange
sight
to
watch
the
uncouth
creature
fit
production
of
these
silent
shades
lazily
moving
from
branch
to
branch
every
movement
betrays
not
indolence
exactly
but
extreme
caution
he
never
looses
his
hold
from
one
branch
without
first
securing
himself
to
the
next
and
when
he
does
not
immediately
find
a
bough
to
grasp
with
the
rigid
hooks
into
which
his
paws
are
so
curiously
transformed
he
raises
his
body
supported
on
his
hind
legs
and
claws
around
in
search
of
a
fresh
foothold
after
watching
the
animal
for
about
half
an
hour
i
gave
him
a
charge
of
shot
he
fell
with
a
terrific
crash
but
caught
a
bough
in
his
descent
with
his
powerful
claws
and
remained
suspended
our
indian
lad
tried
to
climb
the
tree
but
was
driven
back
by
swarms
of
stinging
ants
the
poor
little
fellow
slid
down
in
a
sad
predicament
and
plunged
into
the
brook
to
free
himself
two
days
afterwards
i
found
the
body
of
the
sloth
on
the
ground
the
animal
having
dropped
on
the
relaxation
of
the
muscles
a
few
hours
after
death
in
one
of
our
voyages
wallace
and
i
saw
a
sloth
infuscatus
swimming
across
a
river
at
a
place
where
it
was
probably
yards
broad
i
believe
it
is
not
generally
known
that
this
animal
takes
to
the
water
our
men
caught
the
beast
cooked
and
ate
him
in
returning
from
these
trips
we
were
sometimes
benighted
on
the
campos
we
did
not
care
for
this
on
moonlit
nights
when
there
was
no
danger
of
losing
the
path
the
great
heat
felt
in
the
middle
hours
of
the
day
is
much
mitigated
by
four
in
the
afternoon
a
few
birds

make
their
appearance

flocks
of

about

sometimes
settle
in

pretty
little
finches
of
several
species
especially
one

with
and

and
somewhat
resembling
our

i
believe
not
belonging
to
the
same

about
the
grass
enlivening
the
place
with
a
few
musical
notes
the
carashue
mimus
also
then
resumes
its
mellow
song
and
two
or
three
species
of
hummingbird
none
of
which
however
are
peculiar
to
the
district
flit
about
from
tree
to
tree
on
the
other
hand
the
little
blue
and
lizards
which
abound
amongst
the
herbage
during
the
scorching
heats
of
midday
retreat
towards
this
hour
to
their
together
with
the
insects
and
the
numerous
campo
butterflies
some
of
these
latter
resemble
greatly
our
english
species
found
in
heathy
places
namely
a
fritillary
argynnis
euptoieta
hegesia
and
two
smaller
kinds
which
are
deceptively
like
the
little
nemeobius
lucina
after
sunset
the
air
becomes
delightfully
cool
and
fragrant
with
the
aroma
of
fruits
and
flowers
the
nocturnal
animals
then
come
forth
a
monstrous
hairy
spider
five
inches
in

of
a
brown
colour
with
yellowish
lines
along
its
stout
legs

lined
with
silken

be
then
caught
on

at
the
mouth
of
its
burrow
it
is
only
seen
at
night
and
i
think
does
not
wander
far
from
its
den
the
gallery
is
about
two
inches
in
diameter
and
runs
in
a
slanting
direction
about
two
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
soil
as
soon
as
it
is
night
swarms
of
goatsuckers
suddenly
make
their
appearance
wheeling
about
in
a
noiseless
ghostly
manner
in
chase
of
insects
they
sometimes
descend
and
settle
on
a
low
branch
or
even
on
the
pathway
close
to
where
one
is
walking
and
then
squatting
down
on
their
heels
are
difficult
to
distinguish
from
the
surrounding
soil
one
kind
has
a
long
forked
tail
in
the
daytime
they
are
concealed
in
the
wooded
ilhas
where
i
very
often
saw
them
crouched
and
sleeping
on
the
ground
in
the
dense
shade
they
make
no
nest
but
lay
their
eggs
on
the
bare
ground
their
breeding
time
is
in
the
rainy
season
and
fresh
eggs
are
found
from
december
to
june
later
in
the
evening
the
singular
notes
of
the
goatsuckers
are
heard
one
species
crying
quao
quao
another
and
these
are
repeated
at
intervals
far
into
the
night
in
the
most
monotonous
manner
a
great
number
of
toads
are
seen
on
the
bare
sandy
pathways
soon
after
sunset
one
of
them
was
quite
a
colossus
about
seven
inches
in
length
and
three
in
height
this
big
fellow
would
never
move
out
of
the
way
until
we
were
close
to
him
if
we
jerked
him
out
of
the
path
with
a
stick
he
would
slowly
recover
himself
and
then
turn
round
to
have
a
good
impudent
stare
i
have
counted
as
many
as

of

i
will
now
proceed
to
relate
the
incidents
of
my
principal
excursion
up
the
tapajos
which
i
began
to
prepare
for
after
residing
about
six
months
at
santarem
i
was
obliged
this
time
to
travel
in
a
vessel
of
my
own
partly
because
trading
canoes
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
naturalist
very
seldom
pass
between
santarem
and
the
settlements
on
the
river
and
partly
because
i
wished
to
explore
districts
at
my
ease
far
out
of
the
ordinary
track
of
traders
i
soon
found
a
suitable
canoe
a
cuberta
of
about
six
tons
burthen
strongly
built
of
itauba
or
stonewood
a
timber
of
which
all
the
best
vessels
in
the
amazons
country
are
constructed
and
said
to
be
more
durable
than
teak
this
i
hired
of
a
merchant
at
the
cheap
rate
of
reis
or
about
one
shilling
and
twopence
per
day
i
fitted
up
the
cabin
which
as
usual
in
canoes
of
this
class
was
a
square
structure
with
its
floor
above
the
waterline
as
my
sleeping
and
working
apartment
my
chests
filled
with
and
trays
for
specimens
were
arranged
on
each
side
and
above
them
were
shelves
and
pegs
to
hold
my
little
stock
of
useful
books
guns
and
game
bags
boards
and
materials
for
skinning
and
preserving
animals
botanical
press
and
papers
drying
cages
for
insects
and
birds
and
so
forth
a
rush
mat
was
spread
on
the
floor
and
my
hammock
to
be
used
only
when
sleeping
ashore
served
for
a
pillow
the
arched
covering
over
the
hold
in
the
fore
part
of
the
vessel
contained
besides
a
sleeping
place
for
the
crew
my
heavy
chests
stock
of
salt
provisions
and
groceries
and
an
assortment
of
goods
wherewith
to
pay
my
way
amongst
the
or
savage
inhabitants
of
the
interior
the
goods
consisted
of
cashaca
powder
and
shot
a
few
pieces
of
coarse
checked
cotton
cloth
and
prints
axes
large
knives
harpoons
arrowheads
beads
and
other
small
wares
jose
and
myself
were
busy
for
many
days
arranging
these
matters
we
had
to
salt
the
meat
and
grind
a
supply
of
coffee
ourselves
cooking
utensils
crockery
a
set
of
useful
carpenter
tools
and
many
other
things
had
to
be
provided
we
put
all
the
groceries
and
other
perishable
articles
in
tin
canisters
and
boxes
having
found
that
this
was
the
only
way
of
preserving
them
from
dampness
and
insects
in
this
climate
when
all
was
done
our
canoe
looked
like
a
little
floating
workshop
i
could
get
little
information
about
the
river
except
vague
accounts
of
the
difficulty
of
the
navigation
and
the
famito
or
hunger
which
reigned
on
its
banks
as
i
have
before
mentioned
it
is
about
miles
in
length
and
flows
from
south
to
north
in
magnitude
it
stands
the
sixth
amongst
the
tributaries
of
the
amazons
it
is
navigable
however
by
sailing
vessels
only
for
about
miles
above
santarem
the
hiring
of
men
to
navigate
the
vessel
was
our
greatest
trouble
jose
was
to
be
my
helmsman
and
we
thought
three
other
hands
would
be
the
fewest
with
which
we
could
venture
but
all
our
endeavours
to
procure
these
were
fruitless
santarem
is
worse
provided
with
indian
canoemen
than
any
other
town
on
the
river
i
found
on
applying
to
the
tradesmen
to
whom
i
had
brought
letters
of
introduction
and
to
the
brazilian
authorities
that
almost
any
favour
would
be
sooner
granted
than
the
loan
of
hands
a
stranger
however
is
obliged
to
depend
on
them
for
it
is
impossible
to
find
an
indian
or
whom
someone
or
other
of
the
do
not
claim
as
owing
him
money
or
labour
i
was
afraid
at
one
time
i
should
have
been
forced
to
abandon
my
project
on
this
account
at
length
after
many
rebuffs
and
disappointments
jose
contrived
to
engage
one
man
a
mulatto
named
pinto
a
native
of
the
mining
country
of
interior
brazil
who
knew
the
river
well
and
with
these
two
i
resolved
to
start
hoping
to
meet
with
others
at
the
first
village
on
the
road
we
left
santarem
on
the
of
june
the
waters
were
then
at
their
highest
point
and
my
canoe
had
been
anchored
close
to
the
back
door
of
our
house
the
morning
was
cool
and
a
brisk
wind
blew
with
which
we
sped
rapidly
past
the
houses
and
thatched
indian
huts
of
the
suburbs
the
charming
little
bay
of
mapiri
was
soon
left
behind
we
then
doubled
point
maria
josepha
a
headland
formed
of
high
cliffs
of
tabatinga
clay
capped
with
forest
this
forms
the
limit
of
the
river
view
from
santarem
and
here
we
had
our
last
glimpse
at
a
distance
of
seven
or
eight
miles
of
the
city
a
bright
line
of
tiny
white
buildings
resting
on
the
dark
water
a
stretch
of
wild
rocky
uninhabited
coast
was
before
us
and
we
were
fairly
within
the
tapajos
our
course
lay
due
west
for
about
twenty
miles
the
wind
increased
as
we
neared
point
cururu
where
the
river
bends
from
its
northern
course
a
vast
expanse
of
water
here
stretches
to
the
west
and
south
and
the
waves
with
a
strong
breeze
run
very
high
as
we
were
doubling
the
point
the
cable
which
held
our
montaria
in
tow
astern
parted
and
in
endeavouring
to
recover
the
boat
without
which
we
knew
it
would
be
difficult
to
get
ashore
on
many
parts
of
the
coast
we
were
very
near
capsizing
we
tried
to
tack
down
the
river
a
vain
attempt
with
a
strong
breeze
and
no
current
our
ropes
snapped
the
sails
flew
to
rags
and
the
vessel
which
we
now
found
was
deficient
in
ballast
heeled
over
frightfully
contrary
to
jose
advice
i
ran
the
cuberta
into
a
little
bay
thinking
to
cast
anchor
there
and
wait
for
the
boat
coming
up
with
the
wind
but
the
anchor
dragged
on
the
smooth
sandy
bottom
and
the
vessel
went
broadside
on
to
the
rocky
beach
with
a
little
dexterous
management
but
not
until
after
we
had
sustained
some
severe
bumps
we
managed
to
get
out
of
this
difficulty
clearing
the
rocky
point
at
a
close
shave
with
our
soon
after
we
drifted
into
the
smooth
water
of
a
sheltered
bay
which
leads
to
the
charmingly
situated
village
of
altar
do
chao
and
we
were
obliged
to
give
up
our
attempt
to
recover
the
montaria
the
little
settlement
altar
de
chao
altar
of
the
ground
or
earth
altar
owes
its
singular
name
to
the
existence
at
the
entrance
to
the
harbour
of
one
of
those
strange
hills
which
are
so
common
in
this
part
of
the
amazons
country
shaped
like
the
high
altar
in
roman
catholic
churches
it
is
an
isolated
one
and
much
lower
in
height
than
the
similarly
truncated
hills
and
ridges
near
almeyrim
being
elevated
probably
not
more
than
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
it
is
bare
of
trees
but
covered
in
places
with
a
species
of
fern
at
the
head
of
the
bay
is
an
inner
harbour
which
communicates
by
a
channel
with
a
series
of
lakes
lying
in
the
valleys
between
hills
and
stretching
far
into
the
interior
of
the
land
the
village
is
peopled
almost
entirely
by
indians
to
the
number
of
sixty
or
seventy
families
and
the
scattered
houses
are
arranged
in
broad
streets
on
a
strip
of
greensward
at
the
foot
of
a
high
ridge
i
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
situation
of
this
settlement
and
the
number
of
rare
birds
and
insects
which
tenanted
the
forest
that
i
revisited
it
in
the
following
year
and
spent
four
months
making
collections
the
village
itself
is
a
neglected
stricken
place
the
governor
captain
of
trabalhadores
or
indian
workmen
being
an
old
apathetic
who
had
spent
all
his
life
here
the
priest
was
a
most
profligate
character
i
seldom
saw
him
sober
he
was
a
white
however
and
a
man
of
good
ability
i
may
as
well
mention
here
that
a
moral
and
zealous
priest
is
a
great
rarity
in
this
province
the
only
ministers
of
religion
in
the
whole
country
who
appeared
sincere
in
their
calling
being
the
bishop
of
para
and
the
vicars
of
ega
on
the
upper
amazons
and
obydos
the
houses
in
the
village
swarmed
with
vermin
bats
in
the
thatch
formiga
de
fogo
under
the
floors
cockroaches
and
spiders
on
the
walls
very
few
of
them
had
wooden
doors
and
locks
altar
de
chao
was
originally
a
settlement
of
the
aborigines
and
was
called
burari
the
indians
were
always
hostile
to
the
portuguese
and
during
the
disorders
of
joined
the
rebels
in
their
attack
on
santarem
few
of
them
escaped
the
subsequent
slaughter
and
for
this
reason
there
is
now
scarcely
an
old
or
man
in
the
place
as
in
all
the
villages
where
the
original
orderly
and
industrious
habits
of
the
indian
have
been
lost
without
anything
being
learned
from
the
whites
to
make
amends
the
inhabitants
live
in
the
greatest
poverty
the
scarcity
of
fish
in
the
clear
waters
and
rocky
bays
of
the
neighbourhood
is
no
doubt
partly
the
cause
of
the
poverty
and
perennial
hunger
which
reign
here
when
we
arrived
in
the
port
our
canoe
was
crowded
with
the
villagers
men
women
and
children
who
came
to
beg
each
a
piece
of
salt
pirarucu
for
the
love
of
god
they
are
not
quite
so
badly
off
in
the
dry
season
the
shallow
lakes
and
bays
then
contain
plenty
of
fish
and
the
boys
and
women
go
out
at
night
to
spear
them
by
torchlight
the
torches
being
made
of
thin
strips
of
green
bark
from
the
of
palms
tied
in
bundles
many
excellent
kinds
of
fish
are
thus
obtained
amongst
them
the
pescada
whose
white
and
flaky
flesh
when
boiled
has
the
appearance
and
flavour
of
and
the
tucunare
cichla
temensis
a
handsome
species
with
a
large
spot
on
its
tail
many
small
salmonidae
are
also
met
with
and
a
kind
of
sole
called
aramassa
which
moves
along
the
clear
sandy
bottom
of
the
bay
at
these
times
a
species
of
is
common
on
the
sloping
beach
and
bathers
are
frequently
stung
most
severely
by
it
the
weapon
of
this
fish
is
a
strong
blade
with
jagged
edges
about
three
inches
long
growing
from
the
side
of
the
long
fleshy
tail
i
once
saw
a
woman
wounded
by
it
whilse
bathing
she
shrieked
frightfully
and
was
obliged
to
be
carried
to
her
hammock
where
she
lay
for
a
week
in
great
pain
i
have
known
strong
men
to
be
lamed
for
many
months
by
the
sting
there
was
a
mode
of
taking
fish
here
which
i
had
not
before
seen
employed
but
found
afterwards
to
be
very
common
on
the
tapajos
this
is
by
using
a
poisonous
liana
called
timbo
paullinia
pinnata
it
will
act
only
in
the
still
waters
of
creeks
and
pools
a
few
rods
a
yard
in
length
are
mashed
and
soaked
in
the
water
which
quickly
becomes
discoloured
with
the
milky
deleterious
juice
of
the
plant
in
about
half
an
hour
all
the
smaller
fishes
over
a
rather
wide
space
around
the
spot
rise
to
the
surface
floating
on
their
sides
and
with
the
gills
wide
open
evidently
the
poison
acts
by
suffocating
the
fishes
it
spreads
slowly
in
the
water
and
a
very
slight
mixture
seems
sufficient
to
stupefy
them
i
was
surprised
upon
beating
the
water
in
places
where
no
fishes
were
visible
in
the
clear
depths
for
many
yards
round
to
find
sooner
or
later
sometimes
four
hours
afterwards
a
considerable
number
floating
dead
on
the
surface
the
people
occupy
themselves
the
greater
part
of
the
year
with
their
small
plantations
of
mandioca
all
the
heavy
work
such
as
felling
and
burning
the
timber
planting
and
weeding
is
done
in
the
plantation
of
each
family
by
a
congregation
of
neighbours
which
they
call
a
pucherum
a
similar
custom
to
the
bee
in
the
backwood
settlements
of
north
america
they
make
quite
a
holiday
of
each
pucherum
when
the
invitation
is
issued
the
family
prepares
a
great
quantity
of
fermented
drink
called
in
this
part
taroba
made
from
soaked
mandioca
cakes
and
porridge
of
manicueira
this
latter
is
a
kind
of
sweet
mandioca
very
different
from
the
yuca
of
the
peruvians
and
macasheira
of
the
brazilians
manihot
aypi
having
oblong
juicy
roots
which
become
very
sweet
a
few
days
after
they
are
gathered
with
these
simple
provisions
they
regale
their
helpers
the
work
is
certainly
done
but
after
a
very
rude
fashion
all
become
soddened
with
taroba
and
the
day
finishes
often
in
a
drunken
brawl
the
climate
is
rather
more
humid
than
that
of
santarem
i
suppose
this
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
neighbouring
country
being
densely
wooded
instead
of
an
open
campo
in
no
part
of
the
country
did
i
enjoy
more
the
moonlit
nights
than
here
in
the
dry
season
after
the
day
work
was
done
i
used
to
go
down
to
the
shores
of
the
bay
and
lie
at
full
length
on
the
cool
sand
for
two
or
three
hours
before
bedtime
the
soft
pale
light
resting
on
broad
sandy
beaches
and
huts
reproduced
the
effect
of
a
scene
in
the
cold
north
when
a
coating
of
snow
lies
on
the
landscape
a
heavy
shower
falls
about
once
a
week
and
the
shrubby
vegetation
never
becomes
parched
as
at
santarem
between
the
rains
the
heat
and
dryness
increase
from
day
to
day
the
weather
on
the
first
day
after
the
rain
is
gleamy
with
intervals
of
melting
sunshine
and
passing
clouds
the
next
day
is
rather
drier
and
the
east
wind
begins
to
blow
then
follow
days
of
cloudless
sky
with
gradually
increasing
strength
of
breeze
when
this
has
continued
about
a
week
a
light
mistiness
begins
to
gather
about
the
horizon
clouds
are
formed
grumbling
thunder
is
heard
and
then
generally
in
the
time
down
falls
the
refreshing
rain
the
sudden
chill
caused
by
the
rains
produces
colds
which
are
accompanied
by
the
same
symptoms
as
in
our
own
climate
with
this
exception
the
place
is
very
healthy
june
the
two
young
men
returned
without
meeting
with
my
montaria
and
i
found
it
impossible
here
to
buy
a
new
one
captain
thomas
could
find
me
only
one
hand
this
was
a
spoken
but
willing
young
indian
named
manoel
he
came
on
board
this
morning
at
eight
and
we
then
got
up
our
anchor
and
resumed
our
voyage
the
wind
was
light
and
variable
all
day
and
we
made
only
about
fifteen
miles
by
seven
in
the
evening
the
coast
formed
a
succession
of
long
shallow
bays
with
sandy
beaches
upon
which
the
waves
broke
in
a
long
line
of
surf
ten
miles
above
altar
de
chao
is
a
conspicuous
headland
called
point
cajetuba
during
a
lull
of
the
wind
towards
midday
we
ran
the
cuberta
aground
in
shallow
water
and
waded
ashore
but
the
woods
were
scarcely
penetrable
and
not
a
bird
was
to
be
seen
the
only
thing
observed
worthy
of
note
was
the
quantity
of
drowned
winged
ants
along
the
beach
they
were
all
of
one
species
the
terrible
formiga
de
fogo
myrmica
saevis
sima
the
dead
or
bodies
of
which
were
heaped
up
in
a
line
an
inch
or
two
in
height
and
breadth
the
line
continuing
without
interruption
for
miles
at
the
edge
of
the
water
the
countless
thousands
had
been
doubtless
cast
into
the
river
while
flying
during
a
sudden
squall
the
night
before
and
afterwards
cast
ashore
by
the
waves
we
found
ourselves
at
seven
near
the
mouth
of
a
creek
leading
to
a
small
lake
called
and
the
wind
having
died
away
we
anchored
guided
by
the
lights
ashore
near
the
house
of
a
settler
named
jeronymo
whom
i
knew
and
who
soon
after
showed
us
a
snug
little
harbour
where
we
could
remain
in
safety
for
the
night
the
river
here
can
not
be
less
than
ten
miles
broad
it
is
quite
clear
of
islands
and
free
from
shoals
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
opposite
coast
appeared
in
the
daytime
as
a
long
thin
line
of
forest
with
dim
grey
hills
in
the
background
today
we
had
a
good
wind
which
carried
us
to
the
mouth
of
a
creek
culled
paquiatuba
where
the
inspector
of
the
district
lived
senor
cypriano
for
whom
i
had
brought
an
order
from
captain
thomas
to
supply
me
with
another
hand
we
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
to
land
the
coast
in
this
part
was
a
tract
of
level
country
through
which
flowed
the
winding
rivulet
or
creek
which
gives
its
name
to
a
small
scattered
settlement
hidden
in
the
wilderness
the
hills
here
receding
two
or
three
miles
towards
the
interior
a
large
portion
of
the
forest
was
flooded
the
trunks
of
the
very
high
trees
near
the
mouth
of
the
creek
standing
eighteen
feet
deep
in
water
we
lost
two
hours
working
our
way
with
poles
through
the
inundated
woods
in
search
of
the
port
every
inlet
we
tried
ended
in
a
labyrinth
choked
up
with
bushes
but
we
were
at
length
guided
to
the
right
place
by
the
crowing
of
cocks
on
shouting
for
a
montaria
an
indian
boy
made
his
appearance
guiding
one
through
the
gloomy
thickets
but
he
was
so
alarmed
i
suppose
at
the
apparition
of
a
white
man
in
spectacles
bawling
from
the
brow
of
the
vessel
that
he
shot
back
quickly
into
the
bushes
he
returned
when
manoel
spoke
and
we
went
ashore
the
montaria
winding
along
a
gloomy
overshadowed
made
by
cutting
away
the
lower
branches
and
underwood
the
to
the
houses
was
a
narrow
sandy
alley
bordered
by
trees
of
stupendous
height
overrun
with
creepers
and
having
an
unusual
number
of
long
dangling
from
the
epiphytes
on
their
branches
after
passing
one
low
smoky
little
hut
in
foliage
the
path
branched
off
in
various
directions
and
the
boy
having
left
us
we
took
the
wrong
turn
we
were
brought
to
a
stand
soon
after
by
the
barking
of
dogs
and
on
shouting
as
is
customary
on
approaching
a
dwelling
o
da
casa
oh
of
the
house
a
skinned
native
a
cafuzo
with
a
most
unpleasant
expression
of
countenance
came
forth
through
the
tangled
maze
of
bushes
armed
with
a
long
knife
with
which
he
pretended
to
be
whittling
a
stick
he
directed
us
to
the
house
of
cypriano
which
was
about
a
mile
distant
along
another
forest
road
the
circumstance
of
the
cafuzo
coming
out
armed
to
receive
visitors
very
much
astonished
my
companions
who
talked
it
over
at
every
place
we
visited
for
several
days
afterwards
the
freest
and
most
unsuspecting
welcome
in
these
retired
places
being
always
counted
upon
by
strangers
but
as
manoel
remarked
the
fellow
may
have
been
one
of
the
unpardoned
rebel
leaders
who
had
settled
here
after
the
recapture
of
santarem
in
and
lived
in
fear
of
being
inquired
for
by
the
authorities
of
santarem
after
all
our
troubles
we
found
cypriano
absent
from
home
his
house
was
a
large
one
and
full
of
people
old
and
young
women
and
children
all
of
whom
were
indians
or
mamelucos
several
smaller
huts
surrounded
the
large
dwelling
besides
extensive
open
sheds
containing
mandioca
ovens
and
rude
wooden
mills
for
grinding
to
make
molasses
all
the
buildings
were
embosomed
in
trees
it
would
be
scarcely
possible
to
find
a
more
retired
nook
and
an
air
of
contentment
was
spread
over
the
whole
establishment
cypriano
wife
a
looking
mameluco
girl
was
superintending
the
packing
of
farina
two
or
three
old
women
seated
on
mats
were
making
baskets
with
narrow
strips
of
bark
from
the
leafstalks
of
palms
while
others
were
occupied
lining
them
with
the
broad
leaves
of
a
species
of
maranta
and
filling
them
afterwards
with
farina
which
was
previously
measured
in
a
rude
square
vessel
it
appeared
that
senor
cypriano
was
a
large
producer
of
the
article
selling
baskets
sixty
pounds
weight
each
annually
to
santarem
traders
i
was
sorry
we
were
unable
to
see
him
but
it
was
useless
waiting
as
we
were
told
all
the
men
were
at
present
occupied
in
pucherums
and
he
would
be
unable
to
give
me
the
assistance
i
required
we
returned
to
the
canoe
in
the
evening
and
after
moving
out
into
the
river
anchored
and
slept
june
we
had
a
light
baffling
wind
off
shore
all
day
on
the
and
made
but
fourteen
or
fifteen
miles
by
six
when
the
wind
failing
us
we
anchored
at
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
channel
called
tapaiuna
which
runs
between
a
large
island
and
the
mainland
about
three
we
passed
in
front
of
boim
a
village
on
the
opposite
western
coast
the
breadth
of
the
river
here
is
six
or
seven
miles
a
confused
patch
of
white
on
the
high
land
opposite
was
all
we
saw
of
the
village
the
separate
houses
being
undistinguishable
on
account
of
the
distance
the
coast
along
which
we
sailed
today
is
a
continuation
of
the
low
and
flooded
land
of
paquiatuba
june
next
morning
we
sailed
along
the
tapaiuna
channel
which
is
from
to
yards
in
breadth
we
advanced
but
slowly
as
the
wind
was
generally
dead
against
us
and
stopped
frequently
to
ramble
ashore
wherever
the
was
sandy
it
was
impossible
to
walk
about
on
account
of
the
swarms
of
the
terrible
whose
sting
is
likened
by
the
brazilians
to
the
puncture
of
a
needle
there
was
scarcely
a
square
inch
of
ground
free
from
them
about
three
we
glided
into
a
quiet
shady
creek
on
whose
banks
an
industrious
white
settler
had
located
himself
i
resolved
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
day
and
night
here
and
endeavour
to
obtain
a
fresh
supply
of
provisions
our
stock
of
salt
beef
being
now
nearly
exhausted
the
situation
of
the
house
was
beautiful
the
little
harbour
being
gay
with
water
plants
pontederiae
now
full
of
purple
blossom
from
which
flocks
of
started
up
screaming
as
we
entered
the
owner
sent
a
boy
with
my
men
to
show
them
the
best
place
for
fish
up
the
creek
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
sold
me
a
number
of
fowls
besides
baskets
of
beans
and
farina
the
result
of
the
fishing
was
a
good
supply
of
jandia
a
handsome
spotted
siluride
fish
and
piranha
a
kind
of
salmon
piranhas
are
of
several
kinds
many
of
which
abound
in
the
waters
of
the
tapajos
they
are
caught
with
almost
any
kind
of
bait
for
their
taste
is
indiscriminate
and
their
appetite
most
ravenous
they
often
attack
the
legs
of
bathers
near
the
shore
inflicting
severe
wounds
with
their
strong
triangular
teeth
at
paquiatuba
and
this
place
i
added
about
twenty
species
of
small
fishes
to
my
collection
caught
by
hook
and
line
or
with
the
hand
in
shallow
pools
under
the
shade
of
the
forest
my
men
slept
ashore
and
upon
the
coming
aboard
in
the
morning
pinto
was
drunk
and
insolent
according
to
jose
who
had
kept
himself
sober
and
was
alarmed
at
the
other
violent
conduct
the
owner
of
the
house
and
pinto
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
night
together
drinking
aguardente
de
beiju
a
spirit
distilled
from
the
mandioca
root
we
knew
nothing
of
the
antecedents
of
this
man
who
was
a
tall
strong
fellow
and
it
began
to
dawn
on
us
that
this
was
not
a
very
safe
travelling
companion
in
a
wild
country
like
this
i
thought
it
better
now
to
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
the
next
settlement
aveyros
and
get
rid
of
him
our
course
today
lay
along
a
high
rocky
coast
which
extended
without
a
break
for
about
eight
miles
the
height
of
the
perpendicular
rocks
was
from
to
feet
ferns
and
flowering
shrubs
grew
in
the
crevices
and
the
summit
supported
a
luxuriant
growth
of
forest
like
the
rest
of
the
river
banks
the
waves
beat
with
a
loud
roar
at
the
foot
of
these
inhospitable
barriers
at
two
we
passed
the
mouth
of
a
small
picturesque
harbour
formed
by
a
gap
in
the
precipitous
coast
several
families
have
here
settled
the
place
is
called
or
standing
rock
from
a
remarkable
isolated
cliff
which
stands
erect
at
the
entrance
to
the
little
haven
a
short
distance
beyond
itapuama
we
found
ourselves
opposite
to
the
village
of
pinhel
which
is
perched
like
boim
on
high
ground
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
the
stream
is
here
from
six
to
seven
miles
wide
a
line
of
low
islets
extends
in
front
of
pinhel
and
a
little
further
to
the
south
is
a
larger
island
called
capitari
which
lies
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
river
june
the
wind
freshened
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
a
thick
black
cloud
then
began
to
spread
itself
over
the
sky
a
long
way
down
the
river
the
storm
which
it
portended
however
did
not
reach
us
as
the
dark
threatening
mass
crossed
from
east
to
west
and
the
only
effect
it
had
was
to
impel
a
column
of
cold
air
up
river
creating
a
breeze
with
which
we
bounded
rapidly
forward
the
wind
in
the
afternoon
strengthened
to
a
gale
we
carried
on
with
one
foresail
only
two
of
the
men
holding
on
to
the
boom
to
prevent
the
whole
thing
from
flying
to
pieces
the
rocky
coast
continued
for
about
twelve
miles
above
then
succeeded
a
tract
of
low
marshy
land
which
had
evidently
been
once
an
island
whose
channel
of
separation
from
the
mainland
had
become
silted
up
the
island
of
capitari
and
another
group
of
islets
succeeding
it
called
jacare
on
the
opposite
side
helped
also
to
contract
at
this
point
the
breadth
of
the
river
which
was
now
not
more
than
about
three
miles
the
little
cuberta
almost
flew
along
this
coast
there
being
no
perceptible
current
past
extensive
swamps
margined
with
thick
floating
grasses
at
length
on
rounding
a
low
point
higher
land
again
appeared
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
the
village
of
aveyros
hove
in
sight
in
the
port
of
which
we
cast
anchor
late
in
the
afternoon
aveyros
is
a
small
settlement
containing
only
fourteen
or
fifteen
houses
besides
the
church
but
it
is
the
place
of
residence
of
the
authorities
of
a
large
district
the
priest
juiz
de
paz
the
subdelegado
of
police
and
the
captain
of
the
trabalhadores
the
district
includes
pinhel
which
we
passed
about
twenty
miles
lower
down
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
five
miles
beyond
aveyros
and
also
on
the
left
bank
is
the
missionary
village
of
santa
cruz
comprising
thirty
or
forty
families
of
baptised
mundurucu
indians
who
are
at
present
under
the
management
of
a
capuchin
friar
and
are
independent
of
the
captain
of
trabalhadores
of
aveyros
the
river
view
from
this
point
towards
the
south
was
very
grand
the
stream
is
from
two
to
three
miles
broad
with
green
islets
resting
on
its
surface
and
on
each
side
a
chain
of
hills
stretches
away
in
long
perspective
i
resolved
to
stay
here
for
a
few
weeks
to
make
collections
on
landing
my
first
care
was
to
obtain
a
house
or
room
that
i
might
live
ashore
this
was
soon
arranged
the
head
man
of
the
place
captain
antonio
having
received
notice
of
my
coming
so
that
before
night
all
the
chests
and
apparatus
i
required
were
housed
and
put
in
order
for
working
i
here
dismissed
pinto
who
again
got
drunk
and
quarrelsome
a
few
hours
after
he
came
ashore
he
left
the
next
day
to
my
great
relief
in
a
small
trading
canoe
that
touched
at
the
place
on
its
way
to
santarem
the
indian
manoel
took
his
leave
at
the
same
time
having
engaged
to
accompany
me
only
as
far
as
aveyros
i
was
then
dependent
on
captain
antonio
for
fresh
hands
the
captains
of
trabalhadores
are
appointed
by
the
brazilian
government
to
embody
the
scattered
indian
labourers
and
of
their
respective
districts
to
the
end
that
they
may
supply
passing
travellers
with
men
when
required
a
organisation
is
given
to
the
bodies
some
of
the
steadiest
amongst
the
indians
themselves
being
nominated
as
sergeants
and
all
the
members
mustered
at
the
principal
village
of
their
district
twice
each
year
the
captains
however
universally
abuse
their
authority
monopolising
the
service
of
the
men
for
their
own
purposes
so
that
it
is
only
by
favour
that
the
loan
of
a
can
be
wrung
from
them
i
was
treated
by
captain
antonio
with
great
consideration
and
promised
two
good
indians
when
i
should
be
ready
to
continue
my
voyage
little
happened
worth
narrating
during
my
forty
days
stay
at
aveyros
the
time
was
spent
in
the
quiet
regular
pursuit
of
natural
history
every
morning
i
had
my
long
ramble
in
the
forest
which
extended
to
the
of
the
houses
and
the
afternoons
were
occupied
in
preserving
and
studying
the
objects
collected
the
priest
was
a
lively
old
man
but
rather
a
bore
from
being
able
to
talk
of
scarcely
anything
except
homoeopathy
having
been
smitten
with
the
mania
during
a
recent
visit
to
santarem
he
had
a
portuguese
homoeopathic
dictionary
and
a
little
leather
case
containing
glass
tubes
filled
with
globules
with
which
he
was
doctoring
the
whole
village
a
bitter
enmity
seemed
to
exist
between
the
female
members
of
the
priest
family
and
those
of
the
captain
the
only
white
women
in
the
settlement
it
was
amusing
to
notice
how
they
flaunted
past
each
other
when
going
to
church
on
sundays
in
their
starched
muslin
dresses
i
found
an
intelligent
young
man
living
here
a
native
of
the
province
of
goyaz
who
was
exploring
the
neighbourhood
for
gold
and
diamonds
he
had
made
one
journey
up
a
branch
river
and
declared
to
me
that
he
had
found
one
diamond
but
was
unable
to
continue
his
researches
because
the
indians
who
accompanied
him
refused
to
remain
any
longer
he
was
now
waiting
for
captain
antonio
to
assist
him
with
fresh
men
having
offered
him
in
return
a
share
in
the
results
of
the
enterprise
there
appeared
to
be
no
doubt
that
gold
is
occasionally
found
within
two
or
three
days
journey
of
aveyros
but
all
lengthened
search
is
made
impossible
by
the
scarcity
of
food
and
the
impatience
of
the
indians
who
see
no
value
in
the
precious
metal
and
abhor
the
tediousness
of
the
occupation
it
is
impossible
to
do
without
them
as
they
are
required
to
paddle
the
canoes
the
weather
during
the
month
of
july
was
uninterruptedly
fine
not
a
drop
of
rain
fell
and
the
river
sank
rapidly
the
mornings
for
two
hours
after
sunrise
were
very
cold
we
were
glad
to
wrap
ourselves
in
blankets
on
turning
out
of
our
hammocks
and
walk
about
at
a
quick
pace
in
the
early
sunshine
but
in
the
afternoons
the
heat
was
sickening
for
the
glowing
sun
then
shone
full
on
the
front
of
the
row
of
whitewashed
houses
and
there
was
seldom
any
wind
to
moderate
its
effects
i
began
now
to
understand
why
the
branch
rivers
of
the
amazons
were
so
unhealthy
while
the
main
stream
was
pretty
nearly
free
from
diseases
arising
from
malaria
the
cause
lies
without
doubt
in
the
slack
currents
of
the
tributaries
in
the
dry
season
and
the
absence
of
the
cooling
amazonian
trade
wind
which
purifies
the
air
along
the
banks
of
the
main
river
the
trade
wind
does
not
deviate
from
its
nearly
straight
westerly
course
so
that
the
branch
streams
which
run
generally
at
right
angles
to
the
amazons
and
have
a
slack
current
for
a
long
distance
from
their
mouths
are
left
to
the
horrors
of
nearly
stagnant
air
and
water
aveyros
may
be
called
the
headquarters
of
the
which
might
be
fittingly
termed
the
scourge
of
this
fine
river
the
tapajos
is
nearly
free
from
the
insect
pests
of
other
parts
mosquitoes
motucas
and
piums
but
the
formiga
de
fogo
is
perhaps
a
greater
plague
than
all
the
others
put
together
it
is
found
only
on
sandy
soils
in
open
places
and
seems
to
thrive
most
in
the
neighbourhood
of
houses
and
weedy
villages
such
as
aveyros
it
does
not
occur
at
all
in
the
shades
of
the
forest
i
noticed
it
in
most
places
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
but
the
species
is
not
very
common
on
the
main
river
and
its
presence
is
there
scarcely
noticed
because
it
does
not
attack
man
and
the
sting
is
not
so
virulent
as
it
is
in
the
same
species
on
the
banks
of
the
tapajos
aveyros
was
deserted
a
few
years
before
my
visit
on
account
of
this
little
tormentor
and
the
inhabitants
had
only
recently
returned
to
their
houses
thinking
its
numbers
had
decreased
it
is
a
small
species
of
a
shining
reddish
colour
not
greatly
differing
from
the
common
red
stinging
ant
of
our
own
country
myrmica
rubra
except
that
the
pain
and
irritation
caused
by
its
sting
are
much
greater
the
soil
of
the
whole
village
is
undermined
by
it
the
ground
is
perforated
with
the
entrances
to
their
subterranean
galleries
and
a
little
sandy
dome
occurs
here
and
there
where
the
insects
bring
their
young
to
receive
warmth
near
the
surface
the
houses
are
overrun
with
them
they
dispute
every
fragment
of
food
with
the
inhabitants
and
destroy
clothing
for
the
sake
of
the
starch
all
eatables
are
obliged
to
be
suspended
in
baskets
from
the
rafters
and
the
cords
well
soaked
with
copauba
balsam
which
is
the
only
means
known
of
preventing
them
from
climbing
they
seem
to
attack
persons
out
of
sheer
malice
if
we
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
the
street
even
at
a
distance
from
their
nests
we
were
sure
to
be
overrun
and
severely
punished
for
the
moment
an
ant
touched
the
flesh
he
secured
himself
with
his
jaws
doubled
in
his
tail
and
stung
with
all
his
might
when
we
were
seated
on
chairs
in
the
evenings
in
front
of
the
house
to
enjoy
a
chat
with
our
neighbours
we
had
stools
to
support
our
feet
the
legs
of
which
as
well
as
those
of
the
chairs
were
well
anointed
with
the
balsam
the
cords
of
hammocks
are
obliged
to
be
smeared
in
the
same
way
to
prevent
the
ants
from
paying
sleepers
a
visit
the
inhabitants
declare
that
the
was
unknown
on
the
tapajos
before
the
disorders
of
and
believe
that
the
hosts
sprang
up
from
the
blood
of
the
slaughtered
cabanas
or
rebels
they
have
doubtless
increased
since
that
time
but
the
cause
lies
in
the
depopulation
of
the
villages
and
the
rank
growth
of
weeds
in
the
previously
cleared
spaces
i
have
already
described
the
line
of
sediment
formed
on
the
sandy
shores
lower
down
the
river
by
the
dead
bodies
of
the
winged
individuals
of
this
species
the
exodus
from
their
nests
of
the
males
and
females
takes
place
at
the
end
of
the
rainy
season
june
when
the
swarms
are
blown
into
the
river
by
squalls
of
wind
and
subsequently
cast
ashore
by
the
waves
i
was
told
that
this
wholesale
destruction
of
takes
place
annually
and
that
the
same
compact
heap
of
dead
bodies
which
i
saw
only
in
part
extends
along
the
banks
of
the
river
for
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
the
forest
behind
aveyros
yielded
me
little
except
insects
but
in
these
it
was
very
rich
it
is
not
too
dense
and
broad
sunny
paths
skirted
by
luxuriant
beds
of
lycopodiums
which
form
attractive
sporting
places
for
insects
extend
from
the
village
to
a
swampy
hollow
or
ygapo
which
lies
about
a
mile
inland
of
butterflies
alone
i
enumerated
fully
species
captured
or
seen
in
the
course
of
forty
days
within
a
walk
of
the
village
this
is
a
greater
number
than
is
found
in
the
whole
of
europe
the
only
monkey
i
observed
was
the
callithrix
moloch
one
of
the
kinds
called
by
the
indians
it
is
a
species
clothed
with
long
brown
hair
and
having
hands
of
a
whitish
hue
although
nearly
allied
to
the
cebi
it
has
none
of
their
restless
vivacity
but
is
a
dull
listless
animal
it
goes
in
small
flocks
of
five
or
six
individuals
running
along
the
main
boughs
of
the
trees
one
of
the
specimens
which
i
obtained
here
was
caught
on
a
low
at
the
back
of
our
house
at
sunrise
one
morning
this
was
the
only
instance
of
a
monkey
being
captured
in
such
a
position
that
i
ever
heard
of
as
the
tree
was
isolated
it
must
have
descended
to
the
ground
from
the
neighbouring
forest
and
walked
some
distance
to
get
at
it
the
species
is
sometimes
kept
in
a
tame
state
by
the
natives
it
does
not
make
a
very
amusing
pet
and
survives
captivity
only
a
short
time
i
heard
that
the
white
cebus
the
caiarara
branca
a
kind
of
monkey
i
had
not
yet
seen
and
wished
very
much
to
obtain
inhabited
the
forests
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
so
one
day
on
an
opportunity
being
afforded
by
our
host
going
over
in
a
large
boat
i
crossed
to
go
in
search
of
it
we
were
about
twenty
persons
in
all
and
the
boat
was
an
old
rickety
affair
with
the
gaping
seams
rudely
stuffed
with
tow
and
pitch
in
addition
to
the
human
freight
we
took
three
sheep
with
us
which
captain
antonio
had
just
received
from
santarem
and
was
going
to
add
to
his
new
cattle
farm
on
the
other
side
ten
indian
paddlers
carried
us
quickly
across
the
breadth
of
the
river
could
not
be
less
than
three
miles
and
the
current
was
scarcely
perceptible
when
a
boat
has
to
cross
the
main
amazons
it
is
obliged
to
ascend
along
the
banks
for
half
a
mile
or
more
to
allow
for
drifting
by
the
current
in
this
lower
part
of
the
tapajos
this
is
not
necessary
when
about
halfway
the
sheep
in
moving
about
kicked
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
passengers
took
the
matter
very
coolly
although
the
water
spouted
up
alarmingly
and
i
thought
we
should
inevitably
be
swamped
captain
antonio
took
off
his
socks
to
stop
the
leak
inviting
me
and
the
juiz
de
paz
who
was
one
of
the
party
to
do
the
same
while
two
indians
baled
out
the
water
with
large
cuyas
we
thus
managed
to
keep
afloat
until
we
reached
our
destination
when
the
men
patched
up
the
leak
for
our
return
journey
the
lay
a
short
distance
within
the
mouth
of
a
shady
inlet
up
on
whose
banks
hidden
amongst
the
dense
woods
were
the
houses
of
a
few
indian
and
mameluco
settlers
the
path
to
the
cattle
farm
led
first
through
a
tract
of
swampy
forest
it
then
ascended
a
slope
and
emerged
on
a
fine
sweep
of
prairie
varied
with
patches
of
timber
the
wooded
portion
occupied
the
hollows
where
the
soil
was
of
a
rich
colour
and
of
a
peaty
nature
the
higher
grassy
undulating
parts
of
the
campo
had
a
lighter
and
more
sandy
soil
leaving
our
friends
jose
and
i
took
our
guns
and
dived
into
the
woods
in
search
of
the
monkeys
as
we
walked
rapidly
along
i
was
very
near
treading
on
a
rattlesnake
which
lay
stretched
out
nearly
in
a
straight
line
on
the
bare
sandy
pathway
it
made
no
movement
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
i
escaped
the
danger
by
a
timely
and
sudden
leap
being
unable
to
check
my
steps
in
the
hurried
walk
we
tried
to
excite
the
sluggish
reptile
by
throwing
handfulls
of
sand
and
sticks
at
it
but
the
only
notice
it
took
was
to
raise
its
ugly
horny
tail
and
shake
its
rattle
at
length
it
began
to
move
rather
nimbly
when
we
despatched
it
by
a
blow
on
the
head
with
a
pole
not
wishing
to
fire
on
account
of
alarming
our
game
we
saw
nothing
of
the
white
caiarara
we
met
however
with
a
flock
of
the
common
allied
species
cebus
albifrons
and
killed
one
as
a
specimen
a
resident
on
this
side
of
the
river
told
us
that
the
white
kind
was
found
further
to
the
south
beyond
santa
cruz
the
caiarara
is
pretty
generally
distributed
over
the
forests
of
the
level
country
i
saw
it
very
frequently
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
amazons
where
it
was
always
a
treat
to
watch
a
flock
leaping
amongst
the
trees
for
it
is
the
most
wonderful
performer
in
this
line
of
the
whole
tribe
the
troops
consist
of
thirty
or
more
individuals
which
travel
in
single
file
when
the
foremost
of
the
flock
reaches
the
outermost
branch
of
an
unusually
lofty
tree
he
springs
forth
into
the
air
without
a
moment
hesitation
and
alights
on
the
dome
of
yielding
foliage
belonging
to
the
neighbouring
tree
maybe
fifty
feet
beneath
all
the
rest
following
the
example
they
grasp
upon
falling
with
hands
and
tail
right
themselves
in
a
moment
and
then
away
they
go
along
branch
and
bough
to
the
next
tree
the
caiarara
owes
its
name
in
the
tupi
language
macaw
or
headed
acain
head
and
arara
macaw
to
the
disproportionate
size
of
the
head
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
body
it
is
very
frequently
kept
as
a
pet
in
houses
of
natives
i
kept
one
myself
for
about
a
year
which
accompanied
me
in
my
voyages
and
became
very
familiar
coming
to
me
always
on
wet
nights
to
share
my
blanket
it
is
a
most
restless
creature
but
is
not
playful
like
most
of
the
american
monkeys
the
restlessness
of
its
disposition
seeming
to
arise
from
great
nervous
irritability
and
discontent
the
anxious
painful
and
changeable
expression
of
its
countenance
and
the
want
of
purpose
in
its
movements
betray
this
its
actions
are
like
those
of
a
wayward
child
it
does
not
seem
happy
even
when
it
has
plenty
of
its
favourite
food
bananas
but
will
leave
its
own
meal
to
snatch
the
morsels
out
of
the
hands
of
its
companions
it
differs
in
these
mental
traits
from
its
nearest
kindred
for
another
common
cebus
found
in
the
same
parts
of
the
forest
the
prego
monkey
cebus
cirrhifer
is
a
much
quieter
and
animal
it
is
full
of
tricks
but
these
are
generally
of
a
playful
character
the
caiarara
keeps
the
house
in
a
perpetual
uproar
where
it
is
kept
when
alarmed
or
hungry
or
excited
by
envy
it
screams
piteously
it
is
always
however
making
some
noise
or
other
often
screwing
up
its
mouth
and
uttering
a
succession
of
loud
notes
resembling
a
whistle
my
little
pet
when
loose
used
to
run
after
me
supporting
itself
for
some
distance
on
its
hind
legs
without
however
having
been
taught
to
do
it
he
offended
me
greatly
one
day
by
killing
in
one
of
his
jealous
fits
another
and
much
choicer
pet
the
nocturnal
monkey
nyctipithecus
trivirgatus
someone
had
given
this
a
fruit
which
the
other
coveted
so
the
two
got
to
quarrelling
the
nyctipithecus
fought
only
with
its
paws
clawing
out
and
hissing
like
a
cat
the
other
soon
obtained
the
mastery
and
before
i
could
interfere
finished
his
rival
by
cracking
its
skull
with
his
teeth
upon
this
i
got
rid
of
him
on
recrossing
the
river
to
aveyros
in
the
evening
a
pretty
little
parrot
fell
from
a
great
height
headlong
into
the
water
near
the
boat
having
dropped
from
a
flock
which
seemed
to
be
fighting
in
the
air
one
of
the
indians
secured
it
for
me
and
i
was
surprised
to
find
the
bird
uninjured
there
had
probably
been
a
quarrel
about
mates
resulting
in
our
little
stranger
being
temporarily
stunned
by
a
blow
on
the
head
from
the
beak
of
a
jealous
comrade
the
species
was
the
conurus
guianensis
called
by
the
natives
maracana
the
plumage
green
with
a
patch
of
scarlet
under
the
wings
i
wished
to
keep
the
bird
alive
and
tame
it
but
all
our
efforts
to
reconcile
it
to
captivity
were
vain
it
refused
food
bit
everyone
who
went
near
it
and
damaged
its
plumage
in
its
exertions
to
free
itself
my
friends
in
aveyros
said
that
this
kind
of
parrot
never
became
domesticated
after
trying
nearly
a
week
i
was
recommended
to
lend
the
intractable
creature
to
an
old
indian
woman
living
in
the
village
who
was
said
to
be
a
skillful
in
two
days
she
brought
it
back
almost
as
tame
as
the
familiar
of
our
aviaries
i
kept
my
little
pet
for
upwards
of
two
years
it
learned
to
talk
pretty
well
and
was
considered
quite
a
wonder
as
being
a
bird
usually
so
difficult
of
domestication
i
do
not
know
what
arts
the
old
woman
used
captain
antonio
said
she
fed
it
with
her
saliva
the
chief
reason
why
almost
all
animals
become
so
wonderfully
tame
in
the
houses
of
the
natives
is
i
believe
their
being
treated
with
uniform
gentleness
and
allowed
to
run
at
large
about
the
rooms
our
maracana
used
to
accompany
us
sometimes
in
our
rambles
one
of
the
lads
carrying
it
on
his
head
one
day
in
the
middle
of
a
long
forest
road
it
was
missed
having
clung
probably
to
an
overhanging
bough
and
escaped
into
the
thicket
without
the
boy
perceiving
it
three
hours
afterwards
on
our
return
by
the
same
path
a
voice
greeted
using
a
colloquial
tone
as
we
passed
maracana
we
looked
about
for
some
time
but
could
not
see
anything
until
the
word
was
repeated
with
emphasis
a
when
we
espied
the
little
truant
half
concealed
in
the
foliage
of
a
tree
he
came
down
and
delivered
himself
up
evidently
as
much
rejoiced
at
the
meeting
as
we
were
after
i
had
obtained
the
two
men
promised
stout
young
indians
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
of
age
one
named
ricardo
and
the
other
alberto
i
paid
a
second
visit
to
the
western
side
of
the
river
in
my
own
canoe
being
determined
if
possible
to
obtain
specimens
of
the
white
cebus
we
crossed
over
first
to
the
mission
village
santa
cruz
which
consists
of
thirty
or
forty
mud
huts
closely
built
together
in
three
straight
ugly
rows
on
a
high
gravelly
bank
the
place
was
deserted
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
old
men
and
women
and
a
few
children
a
narrow
belt
of
wood
runs
behind
the
village
beyond
this
is
an
elevated
barren
campo
with
a
clayey
and
gravelly
soil
to
the
south
the
coast
country
is
of
a
similar
description
a
succession
of
hills
bare
grassy
spaces
and
hollows
we
traversed
forest
and
campo
in
various
directions
during
three
days
without
meeting
with
monkeys
or
indeed
with
anything
that
repaid
us
the
time
and
trouble
the
soil
of
the
district
appeared
too
dry
at
this
season
of
the
year
i
had
noticed
in
other
parts
of
the
country
that
mammals
and
birds
resorted
to
the
more
humid
areas
of
forest
we
therefore
proceeded
to
explore
carefully
the
low
and
partly
swampy
tract
along
the
coast
to
the
north
of
santa
cruz
we
spent
two
days
in
this
way
landing
at
many
places
and
penetrating
a
good
distance
in
the
interior
although
unsuccessful
with
regard
to
the
white
cebus
the
time
was
not
wholly
lost
as
i
added
several
small
birds
of
species
new
to
my
collection
on
the
second
evening
we
surprised
a
large
flock
composed
of
about
fifty
individuals
of
a
curious
eagle
with
a
very
long
and
slender
hooked
beak
the
rostrhamus
hamatus
they
were
perched
on
the
bushes
which
surrounded
a
shallow
lagoon
separated
from
the
river
by
a
belt
of
floating
grass
my
men
said
they
fed
on
toads
and
lizards
found
at
the
margins
of
pools
they
formed
a
beautiful
sight
as
they
flew
up
and
wheeled
about
at
a
great
height
in
the
air
we
obtained
only
one
specimen
before
returning
to
aveyros
we
paid
another
visit
to
the
jacare
inlet
leading
to
captain
antonio
cattle
farm
for
the
sake
of
securing
further
specimens
of
the
many
rare
and
handsome
insects
found
there
landing
at
the
port
of
one
of
the
settlers
the
owner
of
the
house
was
not
at
home
and
the
wife
a
buxom
young
woman
a
dark
mameluca
with
clear
though
dark
complexion
and
fine
rosy
cheeks
was
preparing
in
company
with
another
built
amazon
her
rod
and
lines
to
go
out
fishing
for
the
dinner
it
was
now
the
season
for
tucunares
and
senora
joaquina
showed
us
the
fly
baits
used
to
take
this
kind
of
fish
which
she
had
made
with
her
own
hands
of
parrots
feathers
the
rods
used
are
slender
bamboos
and
the
lines
made
from
the
fibres
of
apple
leaves
it
is
not
very
common
for
the
indian
and
women
to
provide
for
themselves
in
the
way
these
spirited
dames
were
doing
although
they
are
all
expert
paddlers
and
very
frequently
cross
wide
rivers
in
their
frail
boats
without
the
aid
of
men
it
is
possible
that
parties
of
indian
women
seen
travelling
alone
in
this
manner
may
have
given
rise
to
the
fable
of
a
nation
of
amazons
invented
by
the
first
spanish
explorers
of
the
country
senora
joaquina
invited
me
and
jose
to
a
tucunare
dinner
for
the
afternoon
and
then
shouldering
their
paddles
and
tucking
up
their
skirts
the
two
dusky
fisherwomen
marched
down
to
their
canoe
we
sent
the
two
indians
into
the
woods
to
cut
to
mend
the
thatch
of
our
cuberta
while
jose
and
i
rambled
through
the
woods
which
skirted
the
campo
on
our
return
we
found
a
most
bountiful
spread
in
the
house
of
our
hostess
a
spotless
white
cloth
was
laid
on
the
mat
with
a
plate
for
each
guest
and
a
pile
of
fragrant
farinha
by
the
side
of
it
the
boiled
tucunares
were
soon
taken
from
the
kettles
and
set
before
us
i
thought
the
men
must
be
happy
husbands
who
owned
such
wives
as
these
the
indian
and
mameluco
women
certainly
do
make
excellent
managers
they
are
more
industrious
than
the
men
and
most
of
them
manufacture
farinha
for
sale
on
their
own
account
their
credit
always
standing
higher
with
the
traders
on
the
river
than
that
of
their
male
connections
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
quantity
of
fish
they
had
taken
there
being
sufficient
for
the
whole
party
which
included
several
children
two
old
men
from
a
neighbouring
hut
and
my
indians
i
made
our
entertainers
a
small
present
of
needles
and
cotton
articles
very
much
prized
and
soon
after
we
reembarked
and
again
crossed
the
river
to
aveyros
august
left
aveyros
having
resolved
to
ascend
a
branch
river
the
cupari
which
enters
the
tapajos
about
eight
miles
above
this
village
instead
of
going
forward
along
the
main
stream
i
should
have
liked
to
visit
the
settlements
of
the
mundurucu
tribe
which
lie
beyond
the
first
cataract
of
the
tapajos
if
it
had
been
compatible
with
the
other
objects
i
had
in
view
but
to
perform
this
journey
a
lighter
canoe
than
mine
would
have
been
necessary
and
six
or
eight
indian
paddlers
which
in
my
case
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
obtain
there
would
be
however
an
opportunity
of
seeing
this
fine
race
of
people
on
the
cupari
as
a
horde
was
located
towards
the
head
waters
of
this
stream
the
distance
from
aveyros
to
the
last
civilised
settlement
on
the
tapajos
itaituba
is
about
forty
miles
the
falls
commence
a
short
distance
beyond
this
place
ten
formidable
cataracts
or
rapids
then
succeed
each
other
at
intervals
of
a
few
miles
the
chief
of
which
are
the
coaita
the
bubure
the
salto
grande
about
thirty
feet
high
and
the
montanha
the
canoes
of
cuyaba
tradesmen
which
descend
annually
to
santarem
are
obliged
to
be
unloaded
at
each
of
these
and
the
cargoes
carried
by
land
on
the
backs
of
indians
while
the
empty
vessels
are
dragged
by
ropes
over
the
obstruction
the
cupari
was
described
to
me
as
flowing
through
a
rich
moist
clayey
valley
covered
with
forests
and
abounding
in
game
while
the
banks
of
the
tapajos
beyond
aveyros
were
barren
sandy
campos
with
ranges
of
naked
or
hills
forming
a
kind
of
country
which
i
had
always
found
very
unproductive
in
natural
history
objects
in
the
dry
season
which
had
now
set
in
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
cupari
on
the
evening
of
the
following
day
august
it
was
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
wide
but
very
deep
we
found
no
bottom
in
the
middle
with
a
line
of
eight
fathoms
the
banks
were
gloriously
wooded
the
familiar
foliage
of
the
cacao
growing
abundantly
amongst
the
mass
of
other
trees
reminding
me
of
the
forests
of
the
main
amazons
we
rowed
for
five
or
six
miles
generally
in
a
direction
although
the
river
had
many
abrupt
bends
and
stopped
for
the
night
at
a
settler
house
situated
on
a
high
bank
accessible
only
by
a
flight
of
rude
wooden
steps
fixed
in
the
clayey
slope
the
owners
were
two
brothers
who
with
their
families
shared
the
large
roomy
dwelling
one
of
them
was
a
blacksmith
and
we
found
him
working
with
two
indian
lads
at
his
forge
in
an
open
shed
under
the
shade
of
mango
trees
they
were
the
sons
of
a
portuguese
immigrant
who
had
settled
here
forty
years
previously
and
married
a
mundurucu
woman
he
must
have
been
a
far
more
industrious
man
than
the
majority
of
his
countrymen
who
emigrate
to
brazil
nowadays
for
there
were
signs
of
former
extensive
cultivation
at
the
back
of
the
house
in
groves
of
orange
lemon
and
coffee
trees
and
a
large
plantation
of
cacao
occupied
the
lower
grounds
the
next
morning
one
of
the
brothers
brought
me
a
beautiful
opossum
which
had
been
caught
in
the
a
little
before
sunrise
it
was
not
so
large
as
a
rat
and
had
soft
brown
fur
paler
beneath
and
on
the
face
with
a
black
stripe
on
each
cheek
this
made
the
third
species
of
marsupial
rat
i
had
so
far
obtained
but
the
number
of
these
animals
is
very
considerable
in
brazil
where
they
take
the
place
of
the
shrews
of
europe
shrew
mice
and
indeed
the
whole
of
the
insectivorous
order
of
mammals
being
entirely
absent
from
tropical
america
one
kind
of
these
opossums
is
aquatic
and
has
webbed
feet
the
terrestrial
species
are
nocturnal
in
their
habits
sleeping
during
the
day
in
hollow
trees
and
coming
forth
at
night
to
prey
on
birds
in
their
roosting
places
it
is
very
difficult
to
rear
poultry
in
this
country
on
account
of
these
small
opossums
scarcely
a
night
passing
in
some
parts
in
which
the
fowls
are
not
attacked
by
them
august
the
river
reminds
me
of
some
parts
of
the
jaburu
channel
being
hemmed
in
by
two
walls
of
forest
rising
to
the
height
of
at
least
a
hundred
feet
and
the
outlines
of
the
trees
being
concealed
throughout
by
a
dense
curtain
of
leafy
creepers
the
impression
of
vegetable
profusion
and
overwhelming
luxuriance
increases
at
every
step
the
deep
and
narrow
valley
of
the
cupari
has
a
moister
climate
than
the
banks
of
the
tapajos
we
have
now
frequent
showers
whereas
we
left
everything
parched
up
by
the
sun
at
aveyros
after
leaving
the
last
sitio
we
advanced
about
eight
miles
and
then
stopped
at
the
house
of
senor
antonio
malagueita
a
mameluco
settler
whom
we
had
been
recommended
to
visit
his
house
and
outbuildings
were
extensive
the
grounds
well
weeded
and
the
whole
wore
an
air
of
comfort
and
which
is
very
uncommon
in
this
country
a
bank
of
indurated
white
clay
sloped
gently
up
from
the
port
to
the
house
and
beds
of
kitchen
herbs
extended
on
each
side
with
rare
sight
rose
and
jasmine
trees
in
full
bloom
senor
antonio
a
rather
tall
aged
man
with
a
countenance
beaming
with
good
nature
came
down
to
the
port
as
soon
as
we
anchored
i
was
quite
a
stranger
to
him
but
he
had
heard
of
my
coming
and
seemed
to
have
made
preparations
i
never
met
with
a
heartier
welcome
on
entering
the
house
the
wife
who
had
more
of
the
indian
tint
and
features
than
her
husband
was
equally
warm
and
frank
in
her
greeting
senor
antonio
had
spent
his
younger
days
at
para
and
had
acquired
a
profound
respect
for
englishmen
i
stayed
here
two
days
my
host
accompanied
me
in
my
excursions
in
fact
his
attentions
with
those
of
his
wife
and
the
host
of
relatives
of
all
degrees
who
constituted
his
household
were
quite
troublesome
as
they
left
me
not
a
moment
privacy
from
morning
till
night
we
had
together
several
long
and
successful
rambles
along
a
narrow
pathway
which
extended
several
miles
into
the
forest
i
here
met
with
a
new
insect
pest
one
which
the
natives
may
be
thankful
is
not
spread
more
widely
over
the
country
it
was
a
large
brown
fly
of
the
tabanidae
family
genus
pangonia
with
a
proboscis
half
an
inch
long
and
sharper
than
the
finest
needle
it
settled
on
our
backs
by
twos
and
threes
at
a
time
and
pricked
us
through
our
thick
cotton
shirts
making
us
start
and
cry
out
with
the
sudden
pain
i
secured
a
dozen
or
two
as
specimens
as
an
instance
of
the
extremely
confined
ranges
of
certain
species
it
may
be
mentioned
that
i
did
not
find
this
insect
in
any
other
part
of
the
country
except
along
half
a
mile
or
so
of
this
gloomy
forest
road
we
were
amused
at
the
excessive
and
almost
absurd
tameness
of
a
fine
mutum
or
curassow
turkey
that
ran
about
the
house
it
was
a
large
species
the
mitu
tuberosa
having
an
coloured
beak
surmounted
by
a
excrescence
of
the
same
hue
it
seemed
to
consider
itself
as
one
of
the
family
attending
all
the
meals
passing
from
one
person
to
another
round
the
mat
to
be
fed
and
rubbing
the
sides
of
its
head
in
a
coaxing
way
against
their
cheeks
or
shoulders
at
night
it
went
to
roost
on
a
chest
in
a
beside
the
hammock
of
one
of
the
little
girls
to
whom
it
seemed
particularly
attached
regularlyfollowing
her
wherever
she
went
about
the
grounds
i
found
this
kind
of
curassow
bird
was
very
common
in
the
forest
of
the
cupari
but
it
is
rare
on
the
upper
amazons
where
an
allied
species
which
has
a
round
instead
of
a
waxen
excrescence
on
the
beak
crax
globicera
is
the
prevailing
kind
these
birds
in
their
natural
state
never
descend
from
the
tops
of
the
loftiest
trees
where
they
live
in
small
flocks
and
build
their
nests
the
mitu
tuberosa
lays
two
white
eggs
it
is
fully
as
large
a
bird
as
the
common
turkey
but
the
flesh
when
cooked
is
drier
and
not
so
well
flavoured
it
is
difficult
to
find
the
reason
why
these
superb
birds
have
not
been
reduced
to
domestication
by
the
indians
seeing
that
they
so
readily
become
tame
the
obstacle
offered
by
their
not
breeding
in
confinement
which
is
probably
owing
to
their
arboreal
habits
might
perhaps
be
overcome
by
repeated
experiment
but
for
this
the
indians
probably
had
not
sufficient
patience
or
intelligence
the
reason
can
not
lie
in
their
insensibility
to
the
value
of
such
birds
for
the
common
turkey
which
has
been
introduced
into
the
country
is
much
prized
by
them
we
had
an
unwelcome
visitor
while
at
anchor
in
the
port
of
antonio
malagueita
i
was
awakened
a
little
after
midnight
as
i
lay
in
my
little
cabin
by
a
heavy
blow
struck
at
the
sides
of
the
canoe
close
to
my
head
which
was
succeeded
by
the
sound
of
a
weighty
body
plunging
into
the
water
i
got
up
but
all
was
again
quiet
except
the
cackle
of
fowls
in
our
which
hung
over
the
side
of
the
vessel
about
three
feet
from
the
cabin
door
i
could
find
no
explanation
of
the
circumstance
and
my
men
being
all
ashore
i
turned
in
again
and
slept
until
morning
i
then
found
my
poultry
loose
about
the
canoe
and
a
large
rent
in
the
bottom
of
the
which
was
about
two
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
water
a
couple
of
fowls
were
missing
senor
antonio
said
the
depredator
was
a
sucuruju
the
indian
name
for
the
anaconda
or
great
water
serpent
eunectes
murinus
which
had
for
months
past
been
haunting
this
part
of
the
river
and
had
carried
off
many
ducks
and
fowls
from
the
ports
of
various
houses
i
was
inclined
to
doubt
the
fact
of
a
serpent
striking
at
its
prey
from
the
water
and
thought
an
alligator
more
likely
to
be
the
culprit
although
we
had
not
yet
met
with
alligators
in
the
river
some
days
afterwards
the
young
men
belonging
to
the
different
sitios
agreed
together
to
go
in
search
of
the
serpent
they
began
in
a
systematicmanner
forming
two
parties
each
embarked
in
three
or
four
canoes
and
starting
from
points
several
miles
apart
whence
they
gradually
approximated
searching
all
the
little
inlets
on
both
sides
the
river
the
reptile
was
found
at
last
sunning
itself
on
a
log
at
the
mouth
of
a
muddy
rivulet
and
despatched
with
harpoons
i
saw
it
the
day
after
it
was
killed
it
was
not
a
very
large
specimen
measuring
only
eighteen
feet
nine
inches
in
length
and
sixteen
inches
in
circumference
at
the
widest
part
of
the
body
i
measured
skins
of
the
anaconda
afterwards
feet
in
length
and
two
feet
in
girth
the
reptile
has
a
most
hideous
appearance
owing
to
its
being
very
broad
in
the
middle
and
tapering
abruptly
at
both
ends
it
is
very
abundant
in
some
parts
of
the
country
nowhere
more
so
than
in
the
lago
grande
near
santarem
where
it
is
often
seen
coiled
up
in
the
corners
of
farmyards
and
is
detested
for
its
habit
of
carrying
off
poultry
young
calves
or
whatever
animal
it
can
get
within
reach
of
at
ega
a
large
anaconda
was
once
near
making
a
meal
of
a
young
lad
about
ten
years
of
age
belonging
to
one
of
my
neighbours
the
father
and
his
son
went
as
was
their
custom
a
few
miles
up
the
teffe
to
gather
wild
fruit
landing
on
a
sloping
sandy
shore
where
the
boy
was
left
to
mind
the
canoe
while
the
man
entered
the
forest
the
beaches
of
the
teffe
form
groves
of
wild
guava
and
myrtle
trees
and
during
most
months
of
the
year
are
partly
overflown
by
the
river
while
the
boy
was
playing
in
the
water
under
the
shade
of
these
trees
a
huge
reptile
of
this
species
stealthily
wound
its
coils
around
him
unperceived
until
it
was
too
late
to
escape
his
cries
brought
the
father
quickly
to
the
rescue
who
rushed
forward
and
seizing
the
anaconda
boldly
by
the
head
tore
his
jaws
asunder
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
this
formidable
serpent
grows
to
an
enormous
bulk
and
lives
to
a
great
age
for
i
heard
of
specimens
having
been
killed
which
measured
feet
in
length
or
double
the
size
of
the
largest
i
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
natives
of
the
amazons
country
universally
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
monster
said
to
be
many
score
fathoms
in
length
and
which
appears
successively
in
different
parts
of
the
river
they
call
it
the
mai
the
mother
or
spirit
of
the
water
this
fable
which
was
doubtless
suggested
by
the
occasional
appearance
of
sucurujus
of
unusually
large
size
takes
a
great
variety
of
forms
and
the
wild
legends
form
the
subject
of
conversation
amongst
old
and
young
over
the
wood
fires
in
lonely
settlements
august
and
on
leaving
the
sitio
of
antonio
malagueita
we
continued
our
way
along
the
windings
of
the
river
generally
in
a
southeast
and
direction
but
sometimes
due
north
for
about
fifteen
miles
when
we
stopped
at
the
house
of
one
paulo
christo
a
mameluco
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
at
aveyros
here
we
spent
the
night
and
part
of
the
next
day
doing
in
the
morning
a
good
five
hours
work
in
the
forest
accompanied
by
the
owner
of
the
place
in
the
afternoon
of
the
we
were
again
under
way
the
river
makes
a
bend
to
the
for
a
short
distance
above
paulo
christo
establishment
and
then
turns
abruptly
to
the
southwest
running
from
that
direction
about
four
miles
the
hilly
country
of
the
interior
then
commences
the
first
token
of
it
being
a
bluff
rising
nearly
straight
from
the
water
to
a
height
of
about
feet
the
breadth
of
the
stream
hereabout
was
not
more
than
sixty
yards
and
the
forest
assumed
a
new
appearance
from
the
abundance
of
the
urucuri
palm
a
species
which
has
a
noble
crown
of
broad
fronds
with
symmetrical
rigid
leaflets
we
reached
in
the
evening
the
house
of
the
last
civilised
settler
on
the
river
senor
joao
john
aracu
a
wiry
active
fellow
and
capital
hunter
whom
i
wished
to
make
a
friend
of
and
persuade
to
accompany
me
to
the
mundurucu
village
and
the
falls
of
the
cupari
some
forty
miles
further
up
the
stayed
at
the
sitio
of
john
aracu
until
the
and
again
in
descending
spent
fourteen
days
at
the
same
place
the
situation
was
most
favourable
for
collecting
the
natural
products
of
the
district
the
forest
was
not
crowded
with
underwood
and
pathways
led
through
it
for
many
miles
and
in
various
directions
i
could
make
no
use
here
of
our
two
men
as
hunters
so
to
keep
them
employed
while
jose
and
i
worked
daily
in
the
woods
i
set
them
to
make
a
montaria
under
john
aracu
directions
the
first
day
a
suitable
tree
was
found
for
the
shell
of
the
boat
of
the
kind
called
itauba
amarello
the
yellow
variety
of
the
stonewood
they
felled
it
and
shaped
out
of
the
trunk
a
log
nineteen
feet
in
length
this
they
dragged
from
the
forest
with
the
help
of
my
men
over
a
road
they
had
previously
made
with
cylindrical
pieces
of
wood
acting
as
rollers
the
distance
was
about
half
a
mile
and
the
ropes
used
for
drawing
the
heavy
load
were
tough
lianas
cut
from
the
surrounding
trees
this
part
of
the
work
occupied
about
a
week
the
log
had
then
to
be
hollowed
out
which
was
done
with
strong
chisels
through
a
slit
made
down
the
whole
length
the
heavy
portion
of
the
task
being
then
completed
nothing
remained
but
to
widen
the
opening
fit
two
planks
for
the
sides
and
the
same
number
of
semicircular
boards
for
the
ends
make
the
benches
and
caulk
the
seams
the
expanding
of
the
log
thus
hollowed
out
is
a
critical
operation
and
not
always
successful
many
a
good
shell
being
spoiled
from
splitting
or
expanding
irregularly
it
is
first
reared
on
tressels
with
the
slit
downwards
over
a
large
fire
which
is
kept
up
for
seven
or
eight
hours
the
process
requiringunremitting
attention
to
avoid
cracks
and
make
the
plank
bend
with
the
proper
dip
at
the
two
ends
wooden
straddlers
made
by
cleaving
pieces
of
tough
elastic
wood
and
fixing
them
with
wedges
are
inserted
into
the
opening
their
compass
being
altered
gradually
as
the
work
goes
on
but
in
different
degrees
according
to
the
part
of
the
boat
operated
upon
our
casca
turned
out
a
good
one
it
took
a
long
time
to
cool
and
was
kept
in
shape
whilst
it
did
so
by
means
of
wooden
when
the
boat
was
finished
it
was
launched
with
great
merriment
by
the
men
who
hoisted
coloured
handkerchiefs
for
flags
and
paddled
it
up
and
down
the
stream
to
try
its
capabilities
my
people
had
suffered
as
much
inconvenience
from
the
want
of
a
montaria
as
myself
so
this
was
a
day
of
rejoicing
to
all
of
us
i
was
very
successful
at
this
place
with
regard
to
the
objects
of
my
journey
about
twenty
new
species
of
fishes
and
a
considerable
number
of
small
reptiles
were
added
to
my
collection
but
very
few
birds
were
met
with
worth
preserving
a
great
number
of
the
most
conspicuous
insects
of
the
locality
were
new
to
me
and
turned
out
to
be
species
peculiar
to
this
part
of
the
amazons
valley
the
most
interesting
acquisition
was
a
large
and
handsome
monkey
of
a
species
i
had
not
before
met
with
the
whiskered
coaita
or
ateles
marginatus
i
saw
a
pair
one
day
in
the
forest
moving
slowly
along
the
branches
of
a
lofty
tree
and
shot
one
of
them
the
next
day
john
aracu
brought
down
another
possibly
the
companion
the
species
is
of
about
the
same
size
as
the
common
black
kind
of
which
i
have
given
an
account
in
a
former
chapter
and
has
a
similar
lean
body
with
limbs
clothed
with
coarse
black
hair
but
it
differs
in
having
the
whiskers
and
a
triangular
patch
on
the
crown
of
the
head
of
a
white
colour
i
thought
the
meat
the
best
flavoured
i
had
ever
tasted
it
resembled
beef
but
had
a
richer
and
sweeter
taste
during
the
time
of
our
stay
in
this
part
of
the
cupari
we
could
get
scarcely
anything
but
fish
to
eat
and
as
this
diet
disagreed
with
me
three
successive
days
of
it
reducing
me
to
a
state
of
great
weakness
i
was
obliged
to
make
the
most
of
our
coaita
meat
we
the
joints
instead
of
salting
them
placing
them
for
several
hours
upon
a
framework
of
sticks
arranged
over
a
fire
a
plan
adopted
by
the
natives
to
preserve
fish
when
they
have
no
salt
and
which
they
call
muquiar
meat
putrefies
in
this
climate
in
less
than
hours
and
salting
is
of
no
use
unless
the
pieces
are
cut
in
thin
slices
anddried
immediately
in
the
sun
my
monkeys
lasted
me
about
a
fortnight
the
last
joint
being
an
arm
with
the
clenched
fist
which
i
used
with
great
economy
hanging
it
in
the
intervals
between
my
frugal
meals
on
a
nail
in
the
cabin
nothing
but
the
hardest
necessity
could
have
driven
me
so
near
to
cannibalism
as
this
but
we
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
obtaining
here
a
sufficient
supply
of
animal
food
about
every
three
days
the
work
on
the
montaria
had
to
be
suspended
and
all
hands
turned
out
for
the
day
to
hunt
and
fish
in
which
they
were
often
unsuccessful
for
although
there
was
plenty
of
game
in
the
forest
it
was
too
widely
scattered
to
be
available
ricardo
and
alberto
occasionally
brought
in
a
tortoise
or
anteater
which
served
us
for
one
day
consumption
we
made
acquaintance
here
with
many
strange
dishes
amongst
them
iguana
eggs
these
are
of
oblong
form
about
an
inch
in
length
and
covered
with
a
flexible
shell
the
lizard
lays
about
two
score
of
them
in
the
hollows
of
trees
they
have
an
oily
taste
the
men
ate
them
raw
beaten
up
with
farinha
mixing
a
pinch
of
salt
in
the
mess
i
could
only
do
with
them
when
mixed
with
tucupi
sauce
of
which
we
had
a
large
jar
full
always
ready
to
temper
unsavoury
morsels
one
day
as
i
was
entomologising
alone
and
unarmed
in
a
dry
ygapo
where
the
trees
were
rather
wide
apart
and
the
ground
coated
to
the
depth
of
eight
or
ten
inches
with
dead
leaves
i
was
near
coming
into
collision
with
a
boa
constrictor
i
had
just
entered
a
little
thicket
to
capture
an
insect
and
while
pinning
it
was
rather
startled
by
a
rushing
noise
in
the
vicinity
i
looked
up
to
the
sky
thinking
a
squall
was
coming
on
but
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
in
the
on
stepping
out
of
the
bushes
i
met
face
to
face
a
huge
serpent
coming
down
a
slope
making
the
dry
twigs
crack
and
fly
with
his
weight
as
he
moved
over
them
i
had
very
frequently
met
with
a
smaller
boa
the
in
a
similar
way
and
knew
from
the
habits
of
the
family
that
there
was
no
danger
so
i
stood
my
ground
on
seeing
me
the
reptile
suddenly
turned
and
glided
at
an
accelerated
pace
down
the
path
wishing
to
take
a
note
of
his
probable
size
and
the
colours
and
markings
of
his
skin
i
set
off
after
him
but
he
increased
his
speed
and
i
was
unable
to
get
near
enough
for
the
purpose
there
was
very
little
of
the
serpentine
movement
in
his
course
the
rapidly
moving
and
shining
body
looked
like
a
stream
of
brown
liquid
flowing
over
the
thick
bed
of
fallen
leaves
rather
than
a
serpent
with
skin
of
varied
colours
he
descended
towards
the
lower
and
moister
parts
of
the
ygapo
the
huge
trunk
of
an
uprooted
tree
here
lay
across
the
road
this
he
glided
over
in
his
undeviating
course
and
soon
after
penetrated
a
dense
swampy
thicket
where
of
course
i
did
not
choose
to
follow
him
i
suffered
terribly
from
heat
and
mosquitoes
as
the
river
sank
with
the
increasing
dryness
of
the
season
although
i
made
an
awning
of
the
sails
to
work
under
and
slept
at
night
in
the
open
air
with
my
hammock
slung
between
the
masts
but
there
was
no
rest
in
any
part
the
canoe
descended
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
gulley
through
which
the
river
flows
between
high
clayey
banks
as
the
water
subsided
and
with
the
glowing
sun
overhead
we
felt
at
midday
as
if
in
a
furnace
i
could
bear
scarcely
any
clothes
in
the
daytime
between
eleven
in
the
morning
and
five
in
the
afternoon
wearing
nothing
but
loose
and
thin
cotton
trousers
and
a
light
straw
hat
and
could
not
be
accommodated
in
john
house
as
it
was
a
small
one
and
full
of
noisy
children
one
night
we
had
a
terrific
storm
the
heat
in
the
afternoon
had
been
greater
than
ever
and
at
sunset
the
sky
had
a
brassy
glare
the
black
patches
of
cloud
which
floated
in
it
being
lighted
up
now
and
then
by
flashes
of
sheet
lightning
the
mosquitoes
at
night
were
more
than
usually
troublesome
and
i
had
just
sunk
exhausted
into
a
doze
towards
the
early
hours
of
morning
when
the
storm
began
a
complete
deluge
of
rain
with
incessant
lightning
and
rattling
explosions
of
thunder
it
lasted
for
eight
hours
the
grey
dawn
opening
amidst
the
crash
of
the
tempest
the
rain
trickled
through
the
seams
of
the
cabin
roof
on
to
my
collections
the
late
hot
weather
having
warped
the
boards
and
it
gave
me
immense
trouble
to
secure
them
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
altogether
i
had
a
bad
night
of
it
but
what
with
storms
heat
mosquitoes
hunger
and
towards
the
last
ill
health
i
seldom
had
a
good
night
rest
on
the
cupari
a
small
creek
traversed
the
forest
behind
john
aracu
house
and
entered
the
river
a
few
yards
from
our
anchoring
place
i
used
to
cross
it
twice
a
day
on
going
and
returning
from
my
hunting
ground
one
day
early
in
september
i
noticed
that
the
water
was
two
or
three
inches
higher
in
the
afternoon
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
this
phenomenon
was
repeated
the
next
day
and
in
fact
daily
until
the
creek
became
dry
with
the
continued
subsidence
of
the
cupari
the
time
of
rising
shifting
a
little
from
day
to
day
i
pointed
out
the
circumstance
to
john
aracu
who
had
not
noticed
it
before
it
was
only
his
second
year
of
residence
in
the
locality
but
agreed
with
me
that
it
must
be
the
mare
yes
the
tide
the
throb
of
the
great
oceanic
pulse
felt
in
this
remote
corner
miles
distant
from
the
place
where
it
first
strikes
the
body
of
fresh
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
amazons
i
hesitated
at
first
at
this
conclusion
but
in
reflecting
that
the
tide
was
known
to
be
perceptible
at
obydos
more
than
miles
from
the
sea
that
at
high
water
in
the
dry
season
a
large
flood
from
the
amazons
enters
the
mouth
of
the
tapajos
and
that
there
is
but
a
very
small
difference
of
level
between
that
point
and
the
cupari
a
fact
shown
by
the
absence
of
current
in
the
dry
season
i
could
have
no
doubt
that
this
conclusion
was
a
correct
one
the
fact
of
the
tide
being
felt
miles
up
the
amazons
passing
from
the
main
stream
to
one
of
its
affluents
miles
from
its
mouth
and
thence
to
a
branch
in
the
third
degree
is
a
proof
of
the
extreme
flatness
of
the
land
which
forms
the
lower
part
of
the
amazonian
valley
this
uniformity
of
level
is
shown
also
in
the
broad
expanses
of
water
formed
near
their
mouths
by
the
principal
affluents
which
cross
the
valley
to
join
the
main
river
august
john
aracu
consented
to
accompany
me
to
the
falls
with
one
of
his
men
to
hunt
and
fish
for
me
one
of
my
objects
was
to
obtain
specimens
of
the
hyacinthine
macaw
whose
range
commences
on
all
the
branch
rivers
of
the
amazons
which
flow
from
the
south
through
the
interior
of
brazil
with
the
first
cataracts
we
started
on
the
our
direction
on
that
day
being
generally
southwest
on
the
our
course
was
southerly
and
southeasterly
this
morning
august
we
arrived
at
the
indian
settlement
the
first
house
of
which
lies
about
miles
above
the
sitio
of
john
aracu
the
river
at
this
place
is
from
sixty
to
seventy
yards
wide
and
runs
in
a
zigzag
course
between
steep
clayey
banks
twenty
to
fifty
feet
in
height
the
houses
of
the
mundurucus
to
the
number
of
about
thirty
are
scattered
along
the
banks
for
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
miles
the
owners
appear
to
have
chosen
all
the
most
picturesque
sites
tracts
of
level
ground
at
the
foot
of
wooded
heights
or
little
havens
with
bits
of
white
sandy
beach
as
if
they
had
an
appreciation
of
natural
beauty
most
of
the
dwellings
are
conical
huts
with
walls
of
framework
filled
in
with
mud
and
thatched
with
palm
leaves
the
broad
eaves
reaching
halfway
to
the
ground
some
are
quadrangular
and
do
not
differ
in
structure
from
those
of
the
settlers
in
other
parts
others
are
open
sheds
or
ranchos
they
seem
generally
to
contain
not
more
than
one
or
two
families
each
at
the
first
house
we
learned
that
all
the
fighting
men
had
this
morning
returned
from
a
two
days
pursuit
of
a
wandering
horde
of
savages
of
the
pararauate
tribe
who
had
strayed
this
way
from
the
interior
lands
and
robbed
the
plantations
a
little
further
on
we
came
to
the
house
of
the
tushaua
or
chief
situated
on
the
top
of
a
high
bank
which
we
had
to
ascend
by
wooden
steps
there
were
four
other
houses
in
the
neighbourhood
all
filled
with
people
a
fine
old
fellow
with
face
shoulders
and
breast
tattooed
all
over
in
a
pattern
was
the
first
strange
object
that
caught
my
eye
most
of
the
men
lay
lounging
or
sleeping
in
their
hammocks
the
women
were
employed
in
an
adjoining
shed
making
farinha
many
of
them
being
quite
naked
and
rushing
off
to
the
huts
to
slip
on
their
petticoats
when
they
caught
sight
of
us
our
entrance
aroused
the
tushaua
from
a
nap
after
rubbing
his
eyes
he
came
forward
and
bade
us
welcome
with
the
most
formal
politeness
and
in
very
good
portuguese
he
was
a
tall
man
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
handsome
regular
features
not
tattooed
and
a
quiet
expression
of
countenance
he
had
been
several
times
to
santarem
and
once
to
para
learning
the
portuguese
language
during
these
journeys
he
was
dressed
in
shirt
and
trousers
made
of
cotton
cloth
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
the
savage
in
his
appearance
or
demeanour
i
was
told
that
he
had
come
into
the
chieftainship
by
inheritance
and
that
the
cupari
horde
of
mundurucus
over
which
his
fathers
had
ruled
before
him
was
formerly
much
more
numerous
furnishing
bows
in
time
of
war
they
could
now
scarcely
muster
forty
but
the
horde
has
no
longer
a
close
political
connection
with
the
main
body
of
the
tribe
which
inhabits
the
banks
of
the
tapajos
six
days
journey
from
the
cupari
settlement
i
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
here
sending
aracu
and
the
men
to
fish
while
i
amused
myself
with
the
tushaua
and
his
people
a
few
words
served
to
explain
my
errand
on
the
river
he
comprehended
at
once
why
white
men
should
admire
and
travel
to
collect
the
beautiful
birds
and
animals
of
his
country
and
neither
he
nor
his
people
spoke
a
single
word
about
trading
or
gave
us
any
trouble
by
coveting
the
things
we
had
brought
he
related
to
me
the
events
of
the
preceding
three
days
the
pararauates
were
a
tribe
of
intractable
savages
with
whom
the
mundurucus
have
been
always
at
war
they
had
no
fixed
abode
and
of
course
made
no
plantations
but
passed
their
lives
like
the
wild
beasts
roaming
through
the
forest
guided
by
the
sun
wherever
they
found
themselves
at
there
they
slept
slinging
their
bast
hammocks
which
are
carried
by
the
women
to
the
trees
they
cross
the
streams
which
lie
in
their
course
in
bark
canoes
which
they
make
on
reaching
the
water
and
cast
away
after
landing
on
the
opposite
side
the
tribe
is
very
numerous
but
the
different
hordes
obey
only
their
own
chieftains
the
mundurucus
of
the
upper
tapajos
have
an
expedition
on
foot
against
them
at
the
present
time
and
the
tushaua
supposed
that
the
horde
which
had
just
been
chased
from
his
maloca
were
fugitives
from
that
direction
there
were
about
a
hundred
of
them
including
men
women
and
children
before
they
were
discovered
the
hungry
savages
had
uprooted
all
the
macasheira
sweet
potatoes
and
sugarcane
which
the
industrious
mundurucus
had
planted
for
the
season
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
as
soon
as
they
were
seen
they
made
off
but
the
tushaua
quickly
got
together
all
the
young
men
of
the
settlement
about
thirty
in
number
who
armed
themselves
with
guns
bows
and
arrows
and
javelins
and
started
in
pursuit
they
tracked
them
as
before
related
for
two
days
through
the
forest
but
lost
their
traces
on
the
further
bank
of
the
cuparitinga
a
branch
stream
flowing
from
the
northeast
the
pursuers
thought
at
one
time
they
were
close
upon
them
having
found
the
inextinguished
fire
of
their
last
encampment
the
footmarks
of
the
chief
could
be
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
their
great
size
and
the
length
of
the
stride
a
small
necklace
made
of
scarlet
beans
was
the
only
trophy
of
the
expedition
and
this
the
tushaua
gave
to
me
i
saw
very
little
of
the
other
male
indians
as
they
were
asleep
in
their
huts
all
the
afternoon
there
were
two
other
tattooed
men
lying
under
an
open
shed
besides
the
old
man
already
mentioned
one
of
them
presented
a
strange
appearance
having
a
semicircular
black
patch
in
the
middle
of
his
face
covering
the
bottom
of
the
nose
and
mouth
crossed
lines
on
his
back
and
breast
and
stripes
down
his
arms
and
legs
it
is
singular
that
the
graceful
curved
patterns
used
by
the
south
sea
islanders
are
quite
unknown
among
the
brazilian
red
men
they
being
all
tattooed
either
in
simple
lines
or
patches
the
nearest
approach
to
elegance
of
design
which
i
saw
was
amongst
the
tucunas
of
the
upper
amazons
some
of
whom
have
a
mark
on
each
cheek
proceeding
from
the
corner
of
the
mouth
the
taste
as
far
as
form
is
concerned
of
the
american
indian
would
seem
to
be
far
less
refined
than
that
of
the
tahitian
and
new
zealander
to
amuse
the
tushaua
i
fetched
from
the
canoe
the
two
volumes
of
knight
pictorial
museum
of
animated
nature
the
engravings
quite
took
his
fancy
and
he
called
his
wives
of
whom
as
i
afterwards
learned
from
aracu
he
had
three
or
four
to
look
at
them
one
of
them
was
a
handsome
girl
decorated
with
necklace
and
bracelets
of
blue
beads
in
a
short
time
others
left
their
work
and
i
then
had
a
crowd
of
women
and
children
around
me
who
all
displayed
unusual
curiosity
for
indians
it
was
no
light
task
to
go
through
the
whole
of
the
illustrations
but
they
would
not
allow
me
to
miss
a
page
making
me
turn
back
when
i
tried
to
skip
the
pictures
of
the
elephant
camels
orangutangs
and
tigers
seemed
most
to
astonish
them
but
they
were
interested
in
almost
everything
down
even
to
the
shells
and
insects
they
recognised
the
portraits
of
the
most
striking
birds
and
mammals
which
are
found
in
their
own
country
the
jaguar
howling
monkeys
parrots
trogons
and
toucans
the
elephant
was
settled
to
be
a
large
kind
of
tapir
but
they
made
but
few
remarks
and
those
in
the
mundurucu
language
of
which
i
understood
only
two
or
three
words
their
way
of
expressing
surprise
was
a
clicking
sound
made
with
the
teeth
similar
to
the
one
we
ourselves
use
or
a
subdued
exclamation
hm
hm
before
i
finished
from
fifty
to
sixty
had
assembled
there
was
no
pushing
or
rudeness
the
women
letting
the
young
girls
and
children
stand
before
them
and
all
behaved
in
the
most
quiet
and
orderly
manner
possible
the
mundurucus
are
perhaps
the
most
numerous
and
formidable
tribe
of
indians
now
surviving
in
the
amazons
region
they
inhabit
the
shores
of
the
tapajos
chiefly
the
right
bank
from
to
south
latitude
and
the
interior
of
the
country
between
that
part
of
the
river
and
the
madeira
on
the
tapajos
alone
they
can
muster
i
was
told
fighting
men
the
total
population
of
the
tribe
may
be
about
they
were
not
heard
of
until
about
ninety
years
ago
when
they
made
war
on
the
portuguese
settlements
their
hosts
crossing
the
interior
of
the
country
eastward
of
the
tapajos
and
attacking
the
establishments
of
the
whites
in
the
province
of
maranham
the
portuguese
made
peace
with
them
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
the
event
being
brought
about
by
the
common
cause
of
quarrel
entertained
by
the
two
peoples
against
the
hated
muras
they
have
ever
since
been
firm
friends
of
the
whites
it
is
remarkable
how
faithfully
this
friendly
feeling
has
been
handed
down
amongst
the
mundurucus
and
spread
to
the
remotest
of
the
scattered
hordes
wherever
a
white
man
meets
a
family
or
even
an
individual
of
the
tribe
he
is
almost
sure
to
be
reminded
of
this
alliance
they
are
the
most
warlike
of
the
brazilian
tribes
and
are
considered
also
the
most
settled
and
industrious
they
are
not
however
superior
in
this
latter
respect
to
the
juris
and
passes
on
the
upper
amazons
or
the
uapes
indians
near
the
headwaters
of
the
rio
negro
they
make
very
large
plantations
of
mandioca
and
sell
the
surplus
produce
which
amounts
to
on
the
tapajos
from
to
baskets
lbs
each
annually
to
traders
who
ascend
the
river
from
santarem
between
the
months
of
august
and
january
they
also
gather
large
quantities
of
sarsaparilla
and
tonka
beans
in
the
forests
the
traders
on
their
arrival
at
the
campinas
the
scantily
wooded
region
inhabited
by
the
main
body
of
mundurucus
beyond
the
cataracts
have
first
to
distribute
their
wares
cheap
cotton
cloths
iron
hatchets
cutlery
small
wares
and
cashaca
amongst
the
minor
chiefs
and
then
wait
three
or
four
months
for
repayment
in
produce
a
rapid
change
is
taking
place
in
the
habits
of
these
indians
through
frequent
intercourse
with
the
whites
and
those
who
dwell
on
the
banks
of
the
tapajos
now
seldom
tattoo
their
children
the
principal
tushaua
of
the
whole
tribe
or
nation
named
joaquim
was
rewarded
with
a
commission
in
the
brazilian
army
in
acknowledgment
of
the
assistance
he
gave
to
the
legal
authorities
during
the
rebellion
of
it
would
be
a
misnomer
to
call
the
mundurucus
of
the
cupari
and
many
parts
of
the
tapajos
savages
their
regular
mode
of
life
agricultural
habits
loyalty
to
their
chiefs
fidelity
to
treaties
and
gentleness
of
demeanour
give
them
a
right
to
a
better
title
yet
they
show
no
aptitude
for
the
civilised
life
of
towns
and
like
the
rest
of
the
brazilian
tribes
seem
incapable
of
any
further
advance
in
culture
in
their
former
wars
they
exterminated
two
of
the
neighbouring
peoples
the
jumas
and
the
jacares
and
make
now
an
annual
expedition
against
the
pararauates
and
one
or
two
other
similar
wild
tribes
who
inhabit
the
interior
of
the
land
additionally
they
are
sometimes
driven
by
hunger
towards
the
banks
of
the
great
rivers
to
rob
the
plantations
of
the
agricultural
indians
these
campaigns
begin
in
july
and
last
throughout
the
dry
months
the
women
generally
accompanying
the
warriors
to
carry
their
arrows
and
javelins
they
had
the
diabolical
custom
in
former
days
of
cutting
off
the
heads
of
their
slain
enemies
and
preserving
them
as
trophies
around
their
houses
i
believe
this
together
with
other
savage
practices
has
been
relinquished
in
those
parts
where
they
have
had
long
intercourse
with
the
brazilians
for
i
could
neither
see
nor
hear
anything
of
these
preserved
heads
they
used
to
sever
the
head
with
knives
made
of
broad
bamboo
and
then
after
taking
out
the
brain
and
fleshy
parts
soak
it
in
bitter
vegetable
oil
andiroba
and
expose
it
for
several
days
over
the
smoke
of
a
fire
or
in
the
sun
in
the
tract
of
country
between
the
tapajos
and
the
madeira
a
deadly
war
has
been
for
many
years
carried
on
between
the
mundurucus
and
the
araras
i
was
told
by
a
frenchman
at
santarem
who
had
visited
that
part
that
all
the
settlements
there
have
a
military
organisation
a
separate
shed
is
built
outside
each
village
where
the
fighting
men
sleep
at
night
sentinels
being
stationed
to
give
the
alarm
with
blasts
of
the
ture
on
the
approach
of
the
araras
who
choose
the
night
for
their
onslaughts
each
horde
of
mundurucus
has
its
paje
or
medicine
man
who
is
the
priest
and
doctor
he
fixes
upon
the
time
most
propitious
for
attacking
the
enemy
exorcises
evil
spirits
and
professes
to
cure
the
sick
all
illness
whose
origin
is
not
very
apparent
is
supposed
to
be
caused
by
a
worm
in
the
part
affected
this
the
paje
pretends
to
extract
he
blows
on
the
seat
of
pain
the
smoke
from
a
large
cigar
made
with
an
air
of
great
mystery
by
rolling
tobacco
in
folds
of
tauari
and
then
sucks
the
place
drawing
from
his
mouth
when
he
has
finished
what
he
pretends
to
be
the
worm
it
is
a
piece
of
very
clumsy
conjuring
one
of
these
pajes
was
sent
for
by
a
woman
in
john
aracu
family
to
operate
on
a
child
who
suffered
much
from
pains
in
the
head
senor
john
contrived
to
get
possession
of
the
supposed
worm
after
the
trick
was
performed
in
our
presence
and
it
turned
out
to
be
a
long
white
airroot
of
some
plant
the
paje
was
with
difficulty
persuaded
to
operate
while
senor
john
and
i
were
present
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
as
well
as
all
others
of
the
same
profession
are
conscious
impostors
handing
down
the
shallow
secret
of
their
divinations
and
tricks
from
generation
to
generation
the
institution
seems
to
be
common
to
all
tribes
of
indians
and
to
be
held
to
more
tenaciously
than
any
other
i
bought
of
the
tushaua
two
beautiful
feather
sceptres
with
their
bamboo
cases
these
are
of
cylindrical
shape
about
three
feet
in
length
and
three
inches
in
diameter
and
are
made
by
gluing
with
wax
the
fine
white
and
yellow
feathers
from
the
breast
of
the
toucan
on
stout
rods
the
tops
being
ornamented
with
long
plumes
from
the
tails
of
parrots
trogons
and
other
birds
the
mundurucus
are
considered
to
be
the
most
expert
workers
in
feathers
of
all
the
south
american
tribes
it
is
very
difficult
however
to
get
them
to
part
with
the
articles
as
they
seem
to
have
a
sort
of
superstitious
regard
for
them
they
manufacture
headdresses
sashes
and
tunics
besides
sceptres
the
feathers
being
assorted
with
a
good
eye
to
the
proper
contrast
of
colours
and
the
quills
worked
into
strong
cotton
webs
woven
with
knitting
sticks
in
the
required
shape
the
dresses
are
worn
only
during
their
festivals
which
are
celebrated
not
at
stated
times
but
whenever
the
tushaua
thinks
fit
dancing
singing
sports
and
drinking
appear
to
be
the
sole
objects
of
these
occasional
holidays
when
a
day
is
fixed
upon
the
women
prepare
a
great
quantity
of
taroba
and
the
monotonous
jingle
is
kept
up
with
little
intermission
night
and
day
until
the
stimulating
beverage
is
finished
we
left
the
tushaua
house
early
the
next
morning
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
glimpse
of
indian
life
in
its
natural
state
obtained
here
and
at
another
cluster
of
houses
visited
higher
up
was
a
pleasant
one
notwithstanding
the
disagreeable
incident
of
the
pararauate
visit
the
indians
are
here
seen
to
the
best
advantage
having
relinquished
many
of
their
most
barbarous
practices
without
being
corrupted
by
too
close
contact
with
the
inferior
whites
and
of
the
civilised
settlements
the
manners
are
simpler
the
demeanour
more
gentle
cheerful
and
frank
than
amongst
the
indians
who
live
near
the
towns
i
could
not
help
contrasting
their
condition
and
the
signs
of
orderly
industrious
habits
with
the
poverty
and
laziness
of
the
people
of
altar
do
chao
i
do
not
think
that
the
introduction
of
liquors
has
been
the
cause
of
much
harm
to
the
brazilian
indian
he
has
his
drinking
bout
now
and
then
like
the
common
working
people
of
other
countries
it
was
his
habit
in
his
original
state
before
europeans
visited
his
country
but
he
is
always
ashamed
of
it
afterwards
and
remains
sober
during
the
pretty
long
intervals
the
harsh
practices
of
the
portuguese
and
their
descendants
have
been
the
greatest
curses
to
the
indians
the
mundurucus
of
the
cupari
however
have
been
now
for
many
years
protected
against
this
is
one
of
the
good
services
rendered
by
the
missionaries
who
take
care
that
the
brazilian
laws
in
favour
of
the
aborigines
shall
be
respected
by
the
brutal
and
unprincipled
traders
who
go
amongst
them
i
think
no
indians
could
be
in
a
happier
position
than
these
simple
peaceful
and
friendly
people
on
the
banks
of
the
cupari
the
members
of
each
family
live
together
and
seem
to
be
much
attached
to
each
other
and
the
authority
of
the
chief
is
exercised
in
the
mildest
manner
perpetual
summer
reigns
around
them
the
land
is
of
the
highest
fertility
and
a
moderate
amount
of
light
work
produces
them
all
the
necessessities
of
their
simple
life
it
is
difficult
to
get
at
their
notions
on
subjects
that
require
a
little
abstract
thought
but
the
mind
of
the
indian
is
in
a
very
primitive
condition
i
believe
he
thinks
of
nothing
except
the
matters
that
immediately
concern
his
daily
material
wants
there
is
an
almost
total
absence
of
curiosity
in
his
mental
disposition
consequently
he
troubles
himself
very
little
concerning
the
causes
of
the
natural
phenomena
around
him
he
has
no
idea
of
a
supreme
being
but
at
the
same
time
he
is
free
from
revolting
superstitions
his
religious
notions
going
no
farther
than
the
belief
in
an
evil
spirit
regarded
merely
as
a
kind
of
hobgoblin
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
his
little
failures
troubles
in
fishing
hunting
and
so
forth
with
so
little
mental
activity
and
with
feelings
and
passions
slow
of
excitement
the
life
of
these
people
is
naturally
monotonous
and
dull
and
their
virtues
are
properly
speaking
only
negative
but
the
picture
of
harmless
homely
contentment
they
exhibit
is
very
pleasing
compared
with
the
state
of
savage
races
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
the
men
awoke
me
at
four
with
the
sound
of
their
oars
on
leaving
the
port
of
the
tushaua
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
dense
fog
veiling
all
surrounding
objects
and
the
air
quite
cold
the
lofty
wall
of
forest
with
the
beautiful
crowns
of
assai
palms
standing
out
from
it
on
their
slender
arching
stems
looked
dim
and
strange
through
the
misty
curtain
the
sudden
change
a
little
after
sunrise
had
quite
a
magical
effect
for
the
mist
rose
up
like
the
gauze
veil
before
the
transformation
scene
at
a
pantomime
and
showed
the
glorious
foliage
in
the
bright
glow
of
morning
glittering
with
dew
drops
we
arrived
at
the
falls
about
ten
the
river
here
is
not
more
than
forty
yards
broad
and
falls
over
a
low
ledge
of
rock
stretching
in
a
nearly
straight
line
across
we
had
now
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
navigation
for
large
vessels
a
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
according
to
our
rough
calculation
of
a
little
over
seventy
miles
i
found
it
the
better
course
now
to
send
jose
and
one
of
the
men
forward
in
the
montaria
with
john
aracu
and
remain
myself
with
the
cuberta
and
our
other
man
to
collect
in
the
neighbouring
forest
we
stayed
here
four
days
one
of
the
boats
returning
each
evening
from
the
upper
river
with
the
produce
of
the
day
chase
of
my
huntsmen
i
obtained
six
good
specimens
of
the
hyacinthine
macaw
besides
a
number
of
smaller
birds
a
species
new
to
me
of
guariba
or
howling
monkey
and
two
large
lizards
the
guariba
was
an
old
male
with
the
hair
much
worn
from
his
rump
and
breast
and
his
body
disfigured
with
large
tumours
made
by
the
grubs
of
a
oestrus
the
back
and
tail
were
of
a
colour
the
limbs
and
underside
of
the
body
black
the
men
ascended
to
the
second
falls
which
form
a
cataract
several
feet
in
height
about
fifteen
miles
beyond
our
anchorage
the
macaws
were
found
feeding
in
small
flocks
on
the
fruit
of
the
tucuma
palm
astryocaryum
tucuma
the
excessively
hard
nut
of
which
is
crushed
into
pulp
by
the
powerful
beak
of
the
bird
i
found
the
craws
of
all
the
specimens
filled
with
the
sour
paste
to
which
the
fruit
had
been
reduced
each
bird
took
me
three
hours
to
skin
and
i
was
occupied
with
these
and
my
other
specimens
every
evening
until
midnight
after
my
own
laborious
day
hunt
working
on
the
roof
of
my
cabin
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
the
place
where
the
cuberta
was
anchored
formed
a
little
rocky
haven
with
a
sandy
beach
sloping
to
the
forest
within
which
were
the
ruins
of
an
indian
maloca
and
a
large
plantation
the
port
swarmed
with
fishes
whose
movements
it
was
amusing
to
watch
in
the
deep
clear
water
the
most
abundant
were
the
piranhas
one
species
which
varied
in
length
according
to
age
from
two
to
six
inches
but
was
recognisable
by
a
black
spot
at
the
root
of
the
tail
was
always
the
quickest
to
seize
any
fragment
of
meat
thrown
into
the
water
when
nothing
was
being
given
to
them
a
few
only
were
seen
scattered
about
their
heads
all
turned
one
way
in
an
attitude
of
expectation
but
as
soon
as
any
offal
fell
from
the
canoe
the
water
was
blackened
with
the
shoals
that
rushed
instantaneously
to
the
spot
those
who
did
not
succeed
in
securing
a
fragment
fought
with
those
who
had
been
more
successful
and
many
contrived
to
steal
the
coveted
morsels
from
their
mouths
when
a
bee
or
fly
passed
through
the
air
near
the
water
they
all
simultaneously
darted
towards
it
as
if
roused
by
an
electric
shock
sometimes
a
larger
fish
approached
and
then
the
host
of
piranhas
took
the
alarm
and
flashed
out
of
sight
the
population
of
the
water
varied
from
day
to
day
once
a
small
shoal
of
a
handsome
fish
called
by
the
natives
acara
bandeira
mesonauta
insignis
of
gunther
came
gliding
through
at
a
slow
pace
forming
a
very
pretty
sight
at
another
time
little
troops
of
animals
with
excessively
long
and
slender
toothed
jaws
sailed
through
the
field
scattering
before
them
the
hosts
of
smaller
fry
and
at
the
rear
of
the
a
kind
called
sarapo
came
wriggling
along
one
by
one
with
a
slow
movement
we
caught
with
hook
and
line
baited
with
pieces
of
banana
several
curimata
anodus
amazonum
a
most
delicious
fish
which
next
to
the
tucunare
and
the
pescada
is
most
esteemed
by
the
natives
the
curimata
seemed
to
prefer
the
middle
of
the
stream
where
the
waters
were
agitated
beneath
the
little
cascade
the
weather
was
now
settled
and
dry
and
the
river
sank
rapidly
six
inches
in
hours
in
this
remote
and
solitary
spot
i
can
say
that
i
heard
for
the
first
and
almost
the
only
time
the
uproar
of
life
at
sunset
which
humboldt
describes
as
having
witnessed
towards
the
sources
of
the
orinoco
but
which
is
unknown
on
the
banks
of
the
larger
rivers
the
noises
of
animals
began
just
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
trees
after
a
sweltering
afternoon
leaving
the
sky
above
of
the
intensest
shade
of
blue
two
flocks
of
howling
monkeys
one
close
to
our
canoe
the
other
about
a
furlong
distant
filled
the
echoing
forests
with
their
dismal
roaring
troops
of
parrots
including
the
hyacinthine
macaw
we
were
in
search
of
began
then
to
pass
over
the
different
styles
of
cawing
and
screaming
of
the
various
species
making
a
terrible
discord
added
to
these
noises
were
the
songs
of
strange
cicadas
one
large
kind
perched
high
on
the
trees
around
our
little
haven
setting
up
a
most
piercing
chirp
it
began
with
the
usual
harsh
jarring
tone
of
its
tribe
but
this
gradually
and
rapidly
became
shriller
until
it
ended
in
a
long
and
loud
note
resembling
the
of
a
locomotive
engine
of
these
wonderful
performers
made
a
considerable
item
in
the
evening
concert
i
had
heard
the
same
species
before
at
para
but
it
was
there
very
uncommon
we
obtained
one
of
them
here
for
my
collection
by
a
lucky
blow
with
a
stone
the
uproar
of
beasts
birds
and
insects
lasted
but
a
short
time
the
sky
quickly
lost
its
intense
hue
and
the
night
set
in
then
began
the
hoo
these
accompanied
by
a
melancholy
kept
up
their
monotonous
cries
until
very
late
my
men
encountered
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
a
jaguar
and
a
black
tiger
and
were
very
much
afraid
of
falling
in
with
the
pararauates
so
that
i
could
not
after
their
return
on
the
fourth
day
induce
them
to
undertake
another
journey
we
began
our
descent
of
the
river
in
the
evening
of
the
of
august
at
night
forest
and
river
were
again
enveloped
in
mist
and
the
air
before
sunrise
was
quite
cold
there
is
a
considerable
current
from
the
falls
to
the
house
of
john
aracu
and
we
accomplished
the
distance
with
its
aid
and
by
rowing
in
seventeen
hours
september
five
in
the
afternoon
we
emerged
from
the
confined
and
stifling
gully
through
which
the
cupari
flows
into
the
broad
tapajos
and
breathed
freely
again
how
i
enjoyed
the
extensive
view
after
being
so
long
pent
up
the
mountainous
coasts
the
grey
distance
the
dark
waters
tossed
by
a
refreshing
breeze
heat
mosquitoes
insufficient
and
bad
food
hard
work
and
anxiety
had
brought
me
to
a
very
low
state
of
health
and
i
was
now
anxious
to
make
all
speed
back
to
santarem
we
touched
at
aveyros
to
embark
some
chests
i
had
left
there
and
to
settle
accounts
with
captain
antonio
and
found
nearly
all
the
people
sick
with
fever
and
vomit
against
which
the
homoeopathic
globules
were
of
no
avail
the
tapajos
had
been
pretty
free
from
epidemics
for
some
years
past
although
it
was
formerly
a
very
unhealthy
river
a
sickly
time
appeared
to
be
now
returning
in
fact
the
year
following
my
visit
was
the
most
fatal
one
ever
experienced
in
this
part
of
the
country
a
kind
of
putrid
fever
broke
out
which
attacked
people
of
all
races
alike
the
accounts
we
received
at
santarem
were
most
distressing
my
cupari
friends
especially
suffered
very
severely
john
aracu
and
his
family
all
fell
victims
with
the
exception
of
his
wife
my
kind
friend
antonio
malagueita
also
died
and
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
mundurucu
village
the
descent
of
the
tapajos
in
the
height
of
the
dry
season
which
was
now
close
at
hand
is
very
hazardous
on
account
of
the
strong
winds
absence
of
current
and
shoaly
water
far
away
from
the
coasts
the
river
towards
the
end
of
september
is
about
thirty
feet
shallower
than
in
june
and
in
many
places
ledges
of
rock
are
laid
bare
or
covered
with
only
a
small
depth
of
water
i
had
been
warned
of
these
circumstances
by
my
cupari
friends
but
did
not
form
an
adequate
idea
of
what
we
should
have
to
undergo
canoes
in
descending
only
travel
at
night
when
the
terral
or
light
blows
off
the
eastern
shore
in
the
daytime
a
strong
wind
rages
from
down
river
against
which
it
is
impossible
to
contend
as
there
is
no
current
and
the
swell
raised
by
its
sweeping
over
scores
of
miles
of
shallow
water
is
dangerous
to
small
vessels
the
coast
for
the
greater
part
of
the
distance
affords
no
shelter
there
are
however
a
number
of
little
harbours
called
esperas
which
the
canoemen
calculate
upon
carefully
arranging
each
so
as
to
reach
one
of
them
before
the
wind
begins
the
next
morning
we
left
aveyros
in
the
evening
of
the
and
sailed
gently
down
with
the
soft
keeping
about
a
mile
from
the
eastern
shore
it
was
a
brilliant
moonlit
night
and
the
men
worked
cheerfully
at
the
oars
when
the
wind
was
slack
the
terral
wafting
from
the
forest
a
pleasant
perfume
like
that
of
mignonette
at
midnight
we
made
a
fire
and
got
a
cup
of
coffee
and
at
three
in
the
morning
reached
the
sitio
of
ricardo
father
an
indian
named
andre
where
we
anchored
and
slept
september
old
andre
with
his
squaw
came
aboard
this
morning
they
brought
three
tracajas
a
turtle
and
a
basketful
of
tracaja
eggs
to
exchange
with
me
for
cotton
cloth
and
cashaca
ricardo
who
had
been
for
some
time
very
discontented
having
now
satisfied
his
longing
to
see
his
parents
cheerfully
agreed
to
accompany
me
to
santarem
the
loss
of
a
man
at
this
juncture
would
have
been
very
annoying
with
captain
antonio
ill
at
aveyros
and
not
a
hand
to
be
had
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
but
if
we
had
not
called
at
andre
sitio
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
have
kept
ricardo
from
running
away
at
the
first
he
was
a
lively
restless
lad
and
although
impudent
and
troublesome
at
first
had
made
a
very
good
servant
his
companion
alberto
was
of
quite
a
different
disposition
being
extremely
taciturn
and
going
through
all
his
duties
with
the
quietest
regularity
we
left
at
and
progressed
a
little
before
the
wind
began
to
blow
from
down
river
when
we
were
obliged
again
to
cast
anchor
the
terral
began
at
six
in
the
evening
and
we
sailed
with
it
past
the
long
line
of
coast
near
itapuama
at
ten
a
furious
blast
of
wind
came
from
a
cleft
between
the
hills
catching
us
with
the
sails
and
throwing
the
canoe
nearly
on
its
when
we
were
about
a
mile
from
the
shore
jose
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
slacken
the
sheet
of
the
mainsail
while
i
leapt
forward
and
lowered
the
sprit
of
the
foresail
the
two
indians
standing
stupefied
in
the
prow
it
was
what
the
call
a
trovoada
secca
or
white
squall
the
river
in
a
few
minutes
became
a
sheet
of
foam
the
wind
ceased
in
about
half
an
hour
but
the
terral
was
over
for
the
night
so
we
pulled
towards
the
shore
to
find
an
anchoring
place
we
reached
tapaiuna
by
midnight
on
the
and
on
the
morning
of
the
arrived
at
the
retiro
where
we
met
a
shrewd
santarem
trader
whom
i
knew
senor
chico
honorio
who
had
a
larger
and
much
better
provided
canoe
than
our
own
the
wind
was
strong
from
below
all
day
so
we
remained
at
this
place
in
his
company
he
had
his
wife
with
him
and
a
number
of
indians
male
and
female
we
slung
our
hammocks
under
the
trees
and
breakfasted
and
dined
together
our
cloth
being
spread
on
the
sandy
beach
in
the
shade
after
killing
a
large
quantity
of
fish
with
timbo
of
which
we
had
obtained
a
supply
at
itapuama
at
night
we
were
again
under
way
with
the
land
breeze
the
water
was
shoaly
to
a
great
distance
off
the
coast
and
our
canoe
having
the
lighter
draught
went
ahead
our
leadsman
crying
out
the
soundings
to
our
companion
the
depth
was
only
one
fathom
half
a
mile
from
the
coast
we
spent
the
next
day
at
the
mouth
of
a
creek
called
pini
which
is
exactly
opposite
the
village
of
boim
and
on
the
following
night
advanced
about
twelve
miles
every
point
of
land
had
a
long
spit
of
sand
stretching
one
or
two
miles
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
which
it
was
necessary
to
double
by
a
wide
circuit
the
terral
failed
us
at
midnight
when
we
were
near
an
espera
called
marai
the
mouth
of
a
shallow
creek
september
i
did
not
like
the
prospect
of
spending
the
whole
dreary
day
at
marai
where
it
was
impossible
to
ramble
ashore
the
forest
being
utterly
impervious
and
the
land
still
partly
under
water
besides
we
had
used
up
our
last
stick
of
firewood
to
boil
our
coffee
at
sunrise
and
could
not
get
a
fresh
supply
at
this
place
so
there
being
a
dead
calm
on
the
river
in
the
morning
i
gave
orders
at
ten
to
move
out
of
the
harbour
and
try
with
the
oars
to
reach
paquiatuba
which
was
only
five
miles
distant
we
had
doubled
the
shoaly
point
which
stretches
from
the
mouth
of
the
creek
and
were
making
way
merrily
across
the
bay
at
the
head
of
which
was
the
port
of
the
little
settlement
when
we
beheld
to
our
dismay
a
few
miles
down
the
river
the
signs
of
the
violent
day
breeze
coming
down
upon
us
a
long
rapidly
advancing
line
of
foam
with
the
darkened
water
behind
it
our
men
strove
in
vain
to
gain
the
harbour
the
wind
overtook
us
and
we
cast
anchor
in
three
fathoms
with
two
miles
of
shoaly
water
between
us
and
the
land
on
our
lee
it
came
with
the
force
of
a
squall
the
heavy
billows
washing
over
the
vessel
and
drenching
us
with
the
spray
i
did
not
expect
that
our
anchor
would
hold
i
gave
out
however
plenty
of
cable
and
watched
the
result
at
the
prow
jose
placing
himself
at
the
helm
and
the
men
standing
by
the
jib
and
foresail
so
as
to
be
ready
if
we
dragged
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
marai
spit
which
was
now
almost
dead
to
leeward
our
little
bit
of
iron
however
held
its
place
the
bottom
being
fortunately
not
so
sandy
as
in
most
other
parts
of
the
coast
but
our
weak
cable
then
began
to
cause
us
anxiety
we
remained
in
this
position
all
day
without
food
for
everything
was
tossing
about
in
the
hold
baskets
kettles
and
crockery
the
breeze
increased
in
strength
towards
the
evening
when
the
sun
set
fiery
red
behind
the
misty
hills
on
the
western
shore
and
the
gloom
of
the
scene
was
heightened
by
the
strange
contrasts
of
colour
the
inky
water
and
the
lurid
gleam
of
the
sky
heavy
seas
beat
now
and
then
against
the
prow
of
our
vessel
with
a
force
that
made
her
shiver
if
we
had
gone
ashore
in
this
place
all
my
precious
collections
would
have
been
inevitably
lost
but
we
ourselves
could
have
scrambled
easily
to
land
and
with
senor
honorio
who
had
remained
behind
in
the
pini
and
would
pass
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
days
when
night
came
i
lay
down
exhausted
with
watching
and
fatigue
and
fell
asleep
as
my
men
had
done
sometime
before
about
nine
i
was
awakened
by
the
montaria
bumping
against
the
sides
of
the
vessel
which
had
veered
suddenly
round
and
the
full
moon
previously
astern
then
shone
full
in
the
cabin
the
wind
had
abruptly
ceased
giving
place
to
light
puffs
from
the
eastern
shore
and
leaving
a
long
swell
rolling
into
the
shoaly
bay
after
this
i
resolved
not
to
move
a
step
beyond
paquiatuba
without
an
additional
man
and
one
who
understood
the
navigation
of
the
river
at
this
season
we
reached
the
at
ten
and
anchored
within
the
mouth
of
the
creek
in
the
morning
i
walked
through
the
beautiful
shady
alleys
of
the
forest
which
were
waterpaths
in
june
when
we
touched
here
in
ascending
the
river
to
the
house
of
inspector
cypriano
after
an
infinite
deal
of
trouble
i
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
furnish
me
with
another
indian
there
are
about
thirty
families
established
in
this
place
but
the
men
had
been
nearly
all
drafted
off
within
the
last
few
weeks
by
the
government
to
accompany
a
military
expedition
against
runaway
negroes
settled
in
villages
in
the
interior
senor
cypriano
was
a
and
extremely
civil
young
mameluco
he
accompanied
us
on
the
night
of
the
five
miles
down
the
river
to
point
jaguarari
where
the
man
lived
whom
he
intended
to
send
with
me
i
was
glad
to
find
my
new
hand
a
steady
aged
and
married
indian
his
name
was
of
very
good
promise
angelo
custodio
guardian
angel
point
jaguarari
forms
at
this
season
of
the
year
a
high
sandbank
which
is
prolonged
as
a
narrow
spit
stretching
about
three
miles
towards
the
middle
of
the
river
we
rounded
this
with
great
difficulty
on
the
night
of
the
reaching
before
daylight
a
good
shelter
behind
a
similar
sandbank
at
point
acaratingari
a
headland
situated
not
more
than
five
miles
in
a
straight
line
from
our
last
anchoring
place
we
remained
here
all
day
the
men
beating
timbo
in
a
quiet
pool
between
the
sandbank
and
the
mainland
and
obtaining
a
great
quantity
of
fish
from
which
i
selected
six
species
new
to
my
collection
we
made
rather
better
progress
the
two
following
nights
but
the
terral
now
always
blew
strongly
from
the
after
midnight
and
thus
limited
the
hours
during
which
we
could
navigate
forcing
us
to
seek
the
nearest
shelter
to
avoid
being
driven
back
faster
than
we
came
on
the
of
october
we
reached
point
cajetuba
and
had
a
pleasant
day
ashore
the
river
scenery
in
this
neighbourhood
is
of
the
greatest
beauty
a
few
houses
of
settlers
are
seen
at
the
bottom
of
the
broad
bay
of
at
the
foot
of
a
range
of
hills
the
high
beach
of
sand
stretching
in
a
bold
curve
from
point
to
point
the
opposite
shores
of
the
river
are
ten
or
eleven
miles
distant
but
towards
the
north
is
a
clear
horizon
of
water
and
sky
the
country
near
point
cajetuba
is
similar
to
the
neighbourhood
of
santarem
namely
campos
with
scattered
trees
we
gathered
a
large
quantity
of
wild
fruit
caju
umiri
and
aapiranga
the
umiri
berry
humirium
floribundum
is
a
black
drupe
similar
in
appearance
to
the
damascene
plum
and
not
greatly
unlike
it
in
taste
the
aapiranga
is
a
bright
berry
with
a
hard
skin
and
a
sweet
viscid
pulp
enclosing
the
seeds
between
the
point
and
altar
do
chao
was
a
long
stretch
of
sandy
beach
with
moderately
deep
water
our
men
therefore
took
a
rope
ashore
and
towed
the
cuberta
at
merry
speed
until
we
reached
the
village
a
long
deeply
laden
canoe
with
miners
from
the
interior
provinces
passed
us
here
it
was
manned
by
ten
indians
who
propelled
the
boat
by
poles
the
men
five
on
each
side
trotting
one
after
the
other
along
a
plank
arranged
for
the
purpose
from
stem
to
stern
it
took
us
two
nights
to
double
point
cururu
where
as
already
mentioned
the
river
bends
from
its
northerly
course
beyond
altar
do
chao

confused
pile
of
rocks
on
which
many

vessel

laden
with

has
been
wrecked
extends
at
the
season
of
low
water
from
the
foot
of
a
high
bluff
far
into
the
stream
we
were
driven
back
on
the
first
night
october
by
a
squall
the
light
terral
was
carrying
us
pleasantly
round
the
spit
when
a
small
black
cloud
which
lay
near
the
rising
moon
suddenly
spread
over
the
sky
to
the
northward
the
land
breeze
then
ceased
and
furious
blasts
began
to
blow
across
the
river
we
regained
with
great
difficulty
the
shelter
of
the
point
it
blew
almost
a
hurricane
for
two
hours
during
the
whole
of
which
time
the
sky
over
our
heads
was
beautifully
clear
and
starlit
our
shelter
at
first
was
not
very
secure
for
the
wind
blew
away
the
lashings
of
our
sails
and
caused
our
anchor
to
drag
angelo
custodio
however
seized
a
rope
which
was
attached
to
the
foremast
and
leapt
ashore
had
he
not
done
so
we
should
probably
have
been
driven
many
miles
backwards
up
the
river
after
the
cloud
had
passed
the
regular
east
wind
began
to
blow
and
our
further
progress
was
effectually
stopped
for
the
night
the
next
day
we
all
went
ashore
after
securing
well
the
canoe
and
slept
from
eleven
till
five
under
the
shade
of
trees
the
distance
between
point
cururu
and
santarem
was
accomplished
in
three
days
against
the
same
difficulties
of
contrary
and
furious
winds
shoaly
water
and
rocky
coasts
i
was
thankful
at
length
to
be
safely
housed
with
the
whole
of
my
collections
made
under
so
many
privations
and
perils
landed
without
the
loss
or
damage
of
a
specimen
the
men
after
unloading
the
canoe
and
delivering
it
to
its
owner
came
to
receive
their
payment
they
took
part
in
goods
and
part
in
money
and
after
a
good
supper
on
the
night
of
the
october
shouldered
their
bundles
and
set
off
to
walk
by
land
some
eighty
miles
to
their
homes
i
was
rather
surprised
at
the
good
feeling
exhibited
by
these
poor
indians
at
parting
angelo
custodio
said
that
whenever
i
should
wish
to
make
another
voyage
up
the
tapajos
he
would
be
always
ready
to
serve
me
as
pilot
alberto

undemonstrative
as
usual

with

i
had
had
many
sharp

actually
shed

i
must
now
take
the
reader
from
the
picturesque
hilly
country
of
the
tapajos
and
its
dark
streamless
waters
to
the
boundless
wooded
plains
and
yellow
turbid
current
of
the
upper
amazons
or
solimoens
i
will
resume
the
narrative
of
my
first
voyage
up
the
river
which
was
interrupted
at
the
barra
of
the
rio
negro
in
the
seventh
chapter
to
make
way
for
the
description
of
santarem
and
its
neighbourhood
i
embarked
at
barra
on
the
of
march
three
years
before
steamers
were
introduced
on
the
upper
river
in
a
cuberta
which
was
returning
to
ega
the
first
and
only
town
of
any
importance
in
the
vast
solitudes
of
the
solimoens
from
santarem
whither
it
had
been
sent
with
a
cargo
of
turtle
oil
in
earthenware
jars
the
owner
an
old
portuguese
trader
of
ega
named
daniel
cardozo
was
then
at
barra
attending
the
assizes
as
juryman
a
public
duty
performed
without
remuneration
which
took
him
six
weeks
away
from
his
business
he
was
about
to
leave
barra
himself
in
a
small
boat
and
recommended
me
to
send
forward
my
heavy
baggage
in
the
cuberta
and
make
the
journey
with
him
he
would
reach
ega
miles
distant
from
barra
in
twelve
or
fourteen
days
while
the
large
vessel
would
be
thirty
or
forty
days
on
the
road
i
preferred
however
to
go
in
company
with
my
luggage
looking
forward
to
the
many
opportunities
i
should
have
of
landing
and
making
collections
on
the
banks
of
the
river
i
shipped
the
collections
made
between
para
and
the
rio
negro
in
a
large
cutter
which
was
about
descending
to
the
capital
and
after
a
heavy
day
work
got
all
my
chests
aboard
the
ega
canoe
by
eight
at
night
the
indians
were
then
all
embarked
one
of
them
being
brought
dead
drunk
by
his
companions
and
laid
to
sober
himself
all
night
on
the
wet
boards
of
the
tombadilha
the
cabo
a
spirited
young
white
named
estulano
alves
carneiro
who
has
since
risen
to
be
a
distinguished
citizen
of
the
new
province
of
the
upper
amazons
soon
after
gave
orders
to
get
up
the
anchor
the
men
took
to
the
oars
and
in
a
few
hours
we
crossed
the
broad
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
the
night
being
clear
calm
and
starlit
and
the
surface
of
the
inky
waters
smooth
as
a
lake
when
i
awoke
the
next
morning
we
were
progressing
by
espia
along
the
left
bank
of
the
solimoens
the
rainy
season
had
now
set
in
over
the
region
through
which
the
great
river
flows
the
banks
and
all
the
lower
lands
were
already
under
water
and
the
tearing
current
two
or
three
miles
in
breadth
bore
along
a
continuous
line
of
uprooted
trees
and
islets
of
floating
plants
the
prospect
was
most
melancholy
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
dull
murmur
of
the
waters
the
coast
along
which
we
travelled
all
day
was
encumbered
every
step
of
the
way
with
fallen
trees
some
of
which
quivered
in
the
currents
which
set
around
projecting
points
of
land
our
old
pest
the
motuca
began
to
torment
us
as
soon
as
the
sun
gained
power
in
the
morning
white
egrets
were
plentiful
at
the
edge
of
the
water
and
hummingbirds
in
some
places
were
whirring
about
the
flowers
overhead
the
desolate
appearance
of
the
landscape
increased
after
sunset
when
the
moon
rose
in
mist
this
upper
river
the
or
solimoens
is
always
spoken
of
by
the
brazilians
as
a
distinct
stream
this
is
partly
owing
as
before
remarked
to
the
direction
it
seems
to
take
at
the
fork
of
the
rio
negro
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
from
their
partial
knowledge
not
being
able
to
comprehend
the
whole
river
system
in
one
view
it
has
however
many
peculiarities
to
distinguish
it
from
the
lower
course
of
the
river
the
wind
or
which
reaches
in
the
height
of
the
dry
season
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
or
miles
from
the
atlantic
never
blows
on
the
upper
river
the
atmosphere
is
therefore
more
stagnant
and
sultry
and
the
winds
that
do
prevail
are
of
irregular
direction
and
short
duration
a
great
part
of
the
land
on
the
borders
of
the
lower
amazons
is
hilly
there
are
extensive
campos
or
open
plains
and
long
stretches
of
sandy
soil
clothed
with
thinner
forests
the
climate
in
consequence
is
comparatively
dry
many
months
in
succession
during
the
fine
season
passing
without
rain
all
this
is
changed
on
the
solimoens
a
fortnight
of
clear
sunny
weather
is
a
rarity
the
whole
region
through
which
the
river
and
its
affluents
flow
after
leaving
the
easternmost
ridges
of
the
andes
which
poppig
describes
as
rising
like
a
wall
from
the
level
country
miles
from
the
pacific
is
a
vast
plain
about
miles
in
length
and
or
in
breadth
covered
with
one
uniform
lofty
impervious
and
humid
forest
the
soil
is
nowhere
sandy
but
always
either
a
stiff
clay
alluvium
or
vegetable
mold
which
thelatter
in
many
places
is
seen
in
sections
of
the
river
banks
to
be
twenty
or
thirty
feet
in
depth
with
such
a
soil
and
climate
the
luxuriance
of
vegetation
and
the
abundance
and
beauty
of
animal
forms
which
are
already
so
great
in
the
region
nearer
the
atlantic
increase
on
the
upper
river
the
fruits
both
wild
and
cultivated
common
to
the
two
sections
of
the
country
reach
a
progressively
larger
size
in
advancing
westward
and
some
trees
which
blossom
only
once
a
year
at
para
and
santarem
yield
flower
and
fruit
all
the
year
round
at
ega
the
climate
is
healthy
although
one
lives
here
as
in
a
permanent
vapour
bath
i
must
not
however
give
here
a
lengthy
description
of
the
region
while
we
are
yet
on
its
threshold
i
resided
and
travelled
on
the
solimoens
altogether
for
four
years
and
a
half
the
country
on
its
borders
is
a
magnificent
wilderness
where
civilised
man
as
yet
has
scarcely
obtained
a
footing
the
cultivated
ground
from
the
rio
negro
to
the
andes
amounting
only
to
a
few
score
acres
man
indeed
in
any
condition
from
his
small
numbers
makes
but
an
insignificant
figure
in
these
vast
solitudes
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
solimoens
is
miles
in
length
if
we
reckon
from
the
source
of
what
is
usually
considered
the
main
stream
lake
lauricocha
near
lima
but
miles
by
the
route
of
the
ucayali
the
most
considerable
and
practicable
fork
of
the
upper
part
of
the
river
it
is
navigable
at
all
seasons
by
large
steamers
for
upwards
of
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
on
the
we
passed
the
mouth
of
arlauu
a
narrow
inlet
which
communicates
with
the
rio
negro
emerging
in
front
of
barra
our
vessel
was
nearly
drawn
into
this
by
the
violent
current
which
set
from
the
solimoens
the
was
lashed
to
a
strong
tree
about
thirty
yards
ahead
and
it
took
the
whole
strength
of
crew
and
passengers
to
pull
across
we
passed
the
guariba
a
second
channel
connecting
the
two
rivers
on
the
and
on
the
sailed
past
a
straggling
settlement
called
manacapuru
situated
on
a
high
rocky
bank
many
citizens
of
barra
have
sitios
or
in
this
place
although
it
is
eighty
miles
distant
from
the
town
by
the
nearest
road
beyond
manacapuru
all
traces
of
high
land
cease
both
shores
of
the
river
henceforward
for
many
hundred
miles
are
flat
except
in
places
where
the
tabatinga
formation
appears
in
clayey
elevations
of
from
twenty
to
forty
feet
above
the
line
of
highest
water
the
country
is
so
completely
destitute
of
rocky
or
gravelly
beds
that
not
a
pebble
is
seen
during
many
weeks
journey
our
voyage
was
now
very
monotonous
after
leaving
the
last
house
at
manacapuru
we
travelled
nineteen
days
without
seeing
a
human
habitation
the
few
settlers
being
located
on
the
banks
of
inlets
or
lakes
some
distance
from
the
shores
of
the
main
river
we
met
only
one
vessel
during
the
whole
of
the
time
and
this
did
not
come
within
hail
as
it
was
drifting
down
in
the
middle
of
the
current
in
a
broad
part
of
the
river
two
miles
from
the
bank
along
which
we
were
laboriously
warping
our
course
upwards
after
the
first
two
or
three
days
we
fell
into
a
regular
way
of
life
on
board
our
crew
was
composed
of
ten
indians
of
the
cucama
nation
whose
native
country
is
a
portion
of
the
borders
of
the
upper
river
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nauta
in
peru
the
cucamas
speak
the
tupi
language
using
however
a
harsher
accent
than
is
common
amongst
the
indians
from
ega
downwards
they
are
a
shrewd
people
and
are
the
only
indians
who
willingly
and
in
a
body
engage
themselves
to
navigate
the
canoes
of
traders
the
pilot
a
steady
and
faithful
fellow
named
vicente
told
me
that
he
and
his
companions
had
now
been
fifteen
months
absent
from
their
wives
and
families
and
that
on
arriving
at
ega
they
intended
to
take
the
first
chance
of
a
passage
to
nauta
there
was
nothing
in
the
appearance
of
these
men
to
distinguish
them
from
canoemen
in
general
some
were
tall
and
well
built
others
had
squat
figures
with
broad
shoulders
and
excessively
thick
arms
and
legs
no
two
of
them
were
at
all
similar
in
the
shape
of
the
head
vicente
had
an
oval
visage
with
fine
regular
features
while
a
little
dumpy
fellow
the
wag
of
the
party
was
quite
a
mongolian
in
breadth
and
prominence
of
cheek
spread
of
nostrils
and
obliquity
of
eyes
but
these
two
formed
the
extremes
as
to
face
and
figure
none
of
them
were
tattooed
or
disfigured
in
any
way
and
they
were
all
quite
destitute
of
beard
the
cucamas
are
notorious
on
the
river
for
their
provident
habits
the
desire
of
acquiring
property
is
so
rare
a
trait
in
indians
that
the
habits
of
these
people
are
remarked
on
with
surprise
by
the
brazilians
the
first
possession
which
they
strive
to
acquire
on
descending
the
river
into
brazil
which
all
the
peruvian
indians
look
upon
as
a
richer
country
than
their
own
is
a
wooden
trunk
with
lock
and
key
in
this
they
stow
away
carefully
all
their
earnings
converted
into
clothing
hatchets
knives
harpoon
heads
needles
and
thread
and
so
forth
their
wages
are
only
fourpence
or
sixpence
a
day
which
is
often
paid
in
goods
charged
one
hundred
per
cent
above
para
prices
so
that
it
takes
them
a
long
time
to
fill
their
chest
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
set
of
men
in
a
voyage
than
these
poor
indians
during
our
journey
they
lived
and
worked
together
in
the
most
perfect
good
fellowship
i
never
heard
an
angry
word
pass
amongst
them
senor
estulano
let
them
navigate
the
vessel
in
their
own
way
exerting
his
authority
only
now
and
then
when
they
were
inclined
to
be
lazy
vicente
regulated
the
working
hours
these
depended
on
the
darkness
of
the
nights
in
the
first
and
second
quarters
of
the
moon
they
kept
it
up
with
espia
or
oars
until
almost
midnight
in
the
third
and
fourth
quarters
they
were
allowed
to
go
to
sleep
soon
after
sunset
and
were
aroused
at
three
or
four
in
the
morning
to
resume
their
work
on
cool
rainy
days
we
all
bore
a
hand
at
the
espia
trotting
with
bare
feet
on
the
sloppy
deck
in
indian
file
to
the
tune
of
some
wild
boatman
chorus
we
had
a
favorable
wind
for
only
two
days
out
of
the
by
which
we
made
about
forty
miles
the
rest
of
our
long
journey
was
accomplished
literally
by
pulling
our
way
from
tree
to
tree
when
we
encountered
a
remanso
near
the
shore
we
got
along
very
pleasantly
for
a
few
miles
by
rowing
but
this
was
a
rare
occurrence
during
leisure
hours
the
indians
employed
themselves
in
sewing
vicente
was
a
good
hand
at
cutting
out
shirts
and
trousers
and
acted
as
master
tailor
to
the
whole
party
each
of
whom
had
a
thick
steel
thimble
and
a
stock
of
needles
and
thread
of
his
own
vicente
made
for
me
a
set
of
cotton
shirts
during
the
passage
the
goodness
of
these
indians
like
that
of
most
others
amongst
whom
i
lived
consisted
perhaps
more
in
the
absence
of
active
bad
qualities
than
in
the
possession
of
good
ones
in
other
words
it
was
negative
rather
than
positive
their
phlegmatic
apathetic
temperament
coldness
of
desire
and
deadness
of
feeling
want
of
curiosity
and
slowness
of
intellect
make
the
amazonian
indians
very
uninteresting
companions
anywhere
their
imagination
is
of
a
dull
gloomy
quality
and
they
seemed
never
to
be
stirred
by
the
emotions
love
pity
admiration
fear
wonder
joy
orenthusiasm
these
are
characteristics
of
the
whole
race
the
good
fellowship
of
our
cucamas
seemed
to
arise
not
from
warm
sympathy
but
simply
from
the
absence
of
eager
selfishness
in
small
matters
on
the
morning
when
the
favourable
wind
sprung
up
one
of
the
crew
a
lad
of
about
seventeen
years
of
age
was
absent
ashore
at
the
time
of
starting
having
gone
alone
in
one
of
the
montarias
to
gather
wild
fruit
the
sails
were
spread
and
we
travelled
for
several
hours
at
great
speed
leaving
the
poor
fellow
to
paddle
after
us
against
the
strong
current
vicente
who
might
have
waited
a
few
minutes
at
starting
and
the
others
only
laughed
when
the
hardship
of
their
companion
was
alluded
to
he
overtook
us
at
night
having
worked
his
way
with
frightful
labor
the
whole
day
without
a
morsel
of
food
he
grinned
when
he
came
on
board
and
not
a
dozen
words
were
said
on
either
side
their
want
of
curiosity
is
extreme
one
day
we
had
an
unusually
sharp
thunder
shower
the
crew
were
lying
about
the
deck
and
after
each
explosion
all
set
up
a
loud
laugh
the
wag
of
the
party
exclaiming
there
my
old
uncle
hunting
again
an
expression
showing
the
utter
emptiness
of
mind
of
the
spokesman
i
asked
vicente
what
he
thought
was
the
cause
of
lightning
and
thunder
he
said
timaa
ichoqua
i
do
know
he
had
never
given
the
subject
a
moment
thought
it
was
the
same
with
other
things
i
asked
him
who
made
the
sun
the
stars
the
trees
he
did
know
and
had
never
heard
the
subject
mentioned
amongst
his
tribe
the
tupi
language
at
least
as
taught
by
the
old
jesuits
has
a
word
tupana
signifying
god
vicente
sometimes
used
this
word
but
he
showed
by
his
expressions
that
he
did
not
attach
the
idea
of
a
creator
to
it
he
seemed
to
think
it
meant
some
deity
or
visible
image
which
the
whites
worshipped
in
the
churches
he
had
seen
in
the
villages
none
of
the
indian
tribes
on
the
upper
amazons
have
an
idea
of
a
supreme
being
and
consequently
have
no
word
to
express
it
in
their
own
language
vicente
thought
the
river
on
which
we
were
travelling
encircled
the
whole
earth
and
that
the
land
was
an
island
like
those
seen
in
the
stream
but
larger
here
a
gleam
of
curiosity
and
imagination
in
the
indian
mind
is
revealed
the
necessity
of
a
theory
of
the
earth
and
water
has
been
felt
and
a
theory
has
been
suggested
in
all
other
matters
not
concerning
the
common
wants
of
life
the
mind
of
vicente
was
a
blank
and
such
i
always
found
to
be
the
case
with
the
indian
in
his
natural
state
would
a
community
of
any
race
of
men
be
otherwise
were
they
isolated
for
centuries
in
a
wilderness
like
the
amazonian
indians
associated
in
small
numbers
wholly
occupied
in
procuring
a
mere
subsistence
and
without
a
written
language
or
a
leisured
class
to
hand
down
acquired
knowledge
from
generation
to
generation
one
day
a
smart
squall
gave
us
a
good
lift
onward
it
came
with
a
cold
fine
driving
rain
which
enveloped
the
desolate
landscape
as
with
a
mist
the
forest
swayed
and
roared
with
the
force
of
the
gale
and
flocks
of
birds
were
driven
about
in
alarm
over
the
tree
tops
on
another
occasion
a
similar
squall
came
from
an
unfavourable
quarter
it
fell
upon
us
quite
unawares
when
we
had
all
our
sails
out
to
dry
and
blew
us
broadside
foremost
on
the
shore
the
vessel
was
fairly
lifted
on
to
the
tall
bushes
which
lined
the
banks
but
we
sustained
no
injury
beyond
the
entanglement
of
our
rigging
in
the
branches
the
days
and
nights
usually
passed
in
a
dead
calm
or
with
light
intermittent
winds
from
up
river
and
consequently
full
against
us
we
landed
twice
a
day
to
give
ourselves
and
the
indians
a
little
rest
and
change
and
to
cook
our
two
meals
breakfast
and
dinner
there
was
another
passenger
besides
myself
a
cautious
portuguese
who
was
going
to
settle
at
ega
where
he
had
a
brother
long
since
established
he
was
accommodated
in
the
cabin
or
arched
covering
over
the
hold
i
shared
the
proper
with
senores
estulano
and
manoel
the
latter
a
young
caste
to
the
owner
of
the
vessel
under
whose
tuition
i
made
good
progress
in
learning
the
tupi
language
during
the
voyage
our
men
took
it
in
turns
two
at
a
time
to
go
out
fishing
for
which
purpose
we
carried
a
spare
montaria
the
master
had
brought
from
barra
as
provision
nothing
but
stale
salt
pirarucu
half
rotten
fish
in
large
thin
rusty
slabs
farinha
coffee
and
treacle
in
these
voyages
passengers
are
expected
to
provide
for
themselves
as
no
charge
is
made
except
for
freight
of
the
heavy
luggage
or
cargo
they
take
with
them
the
portuguese
and
myself
had
brought
a
few
luxuries
such
as
beans
sugar
biscuits
tea
and
so
forth
but
we
found
ourselves
almost
obliged
to
share
them
with
our
two
companions
and
the
pilot
so
that
before
the
voyage
was
finished
the
small
stock
of
most
of
these
articles
was
exhausted
in
return
we
shared
in
whatever
the
men
brought
sometimes
they
were
quite
unsuccessful
for
fish
is
extremely
difficult
to
procure
in
the
season
of
high
water
on
account
of
the
lower
lands
lying
between
the
inlets
and
infinite
chain
of
pools
and
lakes
being
flooded
from
the
main
river
thus
increasing
tenfold
the
area
over
which
the
finny
population
has
to
range
on
most
days
however
they
brought
two
or
three
fine
fish
and
once
they
harpooned
a
manatee
or
vacca
marina
on
this
occasion
we
made
quite
a
holiday
the
canoe
was
stopped
for
six
or
seven
hours
and
all
turned
out
into
the
forest
to
help
skin
and
cook
the
animal
the
meat
was
cut
into
cubical
slabs
and
each
person
skewered
a
dozen
or
so
of
these
on
a
long
stick
fires
were
made
and
the
spits
stuck
in
the
ground
and
slanted
over
the
flames
to
roast
a
drizzling
rain
fell
all
the
time
and
the
ground
around
the
fires
swarmed
with
stinging
ants
attracted
by
the
entrails
and
slime
which
were
scattered
about
the
meat
has
somewhat
the
taste
of
very
coarse
pork
but
the
fat
which
lies
in
thick
layers
between
the
lean
parts
is
of
a
greenish
colour
and
of
a
disagreeable
fishy
flavour
the
animal
was
a
large
one
measuring
nearly
ten
feet
in
length
and
nine
in
girth
at
the
broadest
part
the
manatee
is
one
of
the
few
objects
which
excite
the
dull
wonder
and
curiosity
of
the
indians
notwithstanding
its
commonness
the
fact
of
its
suckling
its
young
at
the
breast
although
an
aquatic
animal
resembling
a
fish
seems
to
strike
them
as
something
very
strange
the
animal
as
it
lay
on
its
back
with
its
broad
rounded
head
and
muzzle
tapering
body
and
smooth
thick
skin
reminded
me
of
those
egyptian
tombs
which
are
made
of
dark
smooth
stone
and
shaped
to
the
human
figure
notwithstanding
the
hard
fare
the
confinement
of
the
canoe
the
trying
weather
frequent
and
drenching
rains
with
gleams
of
fiery
sunshine
and
the
woeful
desolation
of
the
river
scenery
i
enjoyed
the
voyage
on
the
whole
we
were
not
much
troubled
by
mosquitoes
and
therefore
passed
the
nights
very
pleasantly
sleeping
on
deck
wrapped
in
blankets
or
old
sails
when
the
rains
drove
us
below
we
were
less
comfortable
as
there
was
only
just
room
in
the
small
cabin
for
three
of
us
to
lie
close
together
and
the
confined
air
was
stifling
i
became
inured
to
the
piums
in
the
course
of
the
first
week
all
the
exposed
parts
of
my
body
by
that
time
being
so
closely
covered
with
black
punctures
that
the
little
bloodsuckers
could
not
very
easily
find
an
unoccupied
place
to
operate
upon
poor
miguel
the
portuguese
suffered
horribly
from
these
pests
his
ankles
and
wrists
being
so
much
inflamed
that
he
was
confined
to
his
hammock
slung
in
the
hold
for
weeks
at
every
landing
place
i
had
a
ramble
in
the
forest
while
the
redskins
made
the
fire
and
cooked
the
meal
the
result
was
a
large
daily
addition
to
my
collection
of
insects
reptiles
and
shells
sometimes
the
neighbourhood
of
our
encampment
was
a
tract
of
dry
and
spacious
forest
pleasant
to
ramble
in
but
more
frequently
it
was
a
rank
wilderness
into
which
it
was
impossible
to
penetrate
many
yards
on
account
of
uprooted
trees
entangled
webs
of
monstrous
woody
climbers
thickets
of
spiny
bamboos
swamps
or
obstacles
of
one
kind
or
other
the
drier
lands
were
sometimes
beautified
to
the
highest
degree
by
groves
of
the
urucuri
palm
attalea
excelsa
which
grew
by
the
thousands
under
the
crowns
of
the
lofty
ordinary
forest
trees
their
smooth
columnar
stems
being
all
of
nearly
equal
height
forty
or
fifty
feet
and
their
broad
leaves
interlocking
above
to
form
arches
and
woven
canopies
of
elegant
and
diversified
shapes
the
fruit
of
this
palm
ripens
on
the
upper
river
in
april
and
during
our
voyage
i
saw
immense
quantities
of
it
strewn
about
under
the
trees
in
places
where
we
encamped
it
is
similar
in
size
and
shape
to
the
date
and
has
a
flavoured
juicy
pulp
the
indians
would
not
eat
it
i
was
surprised
at
this
as
they
greedily
devoured
many
other
kinds
of
palm
fruit
whose
sour
and
fibrous
pulp
was
much
less
palatable
vicente
shook
his
head
when
he
saw
me
one
day
eating
a
quantity
of
the
urucuri
plums
i
am
not
sure
they
were
not
the
cause
of
a
severe
indigestion
under
which
i
suffered
for
many
days
afterwards
in
passing
slowly
along
the
interminable
wooded
banks
week
after
week
i
observed
that
there
were
three
tolerably
distinct
kinds
of
coast
and
corresponding
forest
constantly
recurring
on
this
upper
river
first
there
were
the
low
and
most
recent
alluvial
deposits
a
mixture
of
sand
and
mud
covered
with
tall
leaved
grasses
or
with
the
before
described
whose
rises
to
a
height
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
the
only
large
trees
which
grow
in
these
places
are
the
cecropiae
many
of
the
smaller
and
newer
islands
were
of
this
description
secondly
there
were
the
moderately
high
banks
which
are
only
partially
overflowed
when
the
flood
season
is
at
its
height
these
are
wooded
with
a
magnificent
varied
forest
in
which
a
great
variety
of
palms
and
marantaceae
form
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
vegetation
the
general
foliage
is
of
a
vivid
hue
the
water
frontage
is
sometimes
covered
with
a
diversified
mass
of
greenery
but
where
the
current
sets
strongly
against
the
friable
earthy
banks
which
at
low
water
are
to
thirty
feet
high
these
are
cut
away
and
expose
a
section
of
forest
where
the
trunks
of
trees
loaded
with
epiphytes
appear
in
massy
colonnades
one
might
safely
say
that
of
the
land
bordering
the
upper
amazons
for
a
thousand
miles
belong
to
this
second
class
the
third
description
of
coast
is
the
higher
undulating
clayey
land
which
appears
only
at
long
intervals
but
extends
sometimes
for
many
miles
along
the
borders
of
the
river
the
coast
at
these
places
is
sloping
and
composed
of
red
or
variegated
clay
the
forest
is
of
a
different
character
from
that
of
the
lower
tracts
it
is
rounder
in
outline
more
uniform
in
its
general
aspect
palms
are
much
less
numerous
and
of
peculiar
species
the
strange
species
iriartea
ventricosa
and
the
slender
oenocarpus
minor
being
especially
characteristic
and
in
short
animal
life
which
imparts
some
cheerfulness
to
the
other
parts
of
the
river
is
seldom
apparent
this
terra
firme
as
it
is
called
and
a
large
portion
of
the
fertile
lower
land
seemed
well
adapted
for
settlement
some
parts
were
originally
peopled
by
the
aborigines
but
these
have
long
since
become
extinct
or
amalgamated
with
the
white
immigrants
i
afterwards
learned
that
there
were
not
more
than
eighteen
or
twenty
families
settled
throughout
the
whole
country
from
manacapuru
to
quary
a
distance
of
miles
and
these
as
before
observed
do
not
live
on
the
banks
of
the
main
stream
but
on
the
shores
of
inlets
and
lakes
the
fishermen
twice
brought
me
small
rounded
pieces
of
very
porous
which
they
had
picked
up
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
main
current
of
the
river
they
were
to
me
objects
of
great
curiosity
as
being
messengers
from
the
distant
volcanoes
of
the
andes
cotopaxi
llanganete
or
sangay
which
rear
their
peaks
amongst
the
rivulets
that
feed
some
of
the
early
tributaries
of
the
amazons
such
as
the
macas
the
pastaza
and
the
napo
the
stones
must
have
already
travelled
a
distance
of
miles
i
afterwards
found
them
rather
common
the
brazilians
use
them
for
cleaning
rust
from
their
guns
and
firmly
believe
them
to
be
solidified
river
foam
a
friend
once
brought
me
when
i
lived
at
santarem
a
large
piece
which
had
been
found
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
below
monte
alegre
about
miles
further
down
the
river
having
reached
this
distance
would
be
pretty
sure
of
being
carried
out
to
sea
and
floated
thence
with
the
northwesterly
atlantic
current
to
shores
many
thousand
miles
distant
from
the
volcanoes
which
ejected
them
they
are
sometimes
stranded
on
the
banks
in
different
parts
of
the
river
reflecting
on
this
circumstance
since
i
arrived
in
england
the
probability
of
these
porous
fragments
serving
as
vehicles
for
the
transportation
of
seeds
of
plants
eggs
of
insects
spawn
of
fish
and
so
forth
has
suggested
itself
to
me
their
rounded
appearance
showed
that
they
must
have
been
rolled
about
for
a
long
time
in
the
shallow
streams
near
the
sources
of
the
rivers
at
the
feet
of
the
volcanoes
before
they
leapt
the
waterfalls
and
embarked
on
the
currents
which
lead
direct
for
the
amazons
they
may
have
been
originally
cast
on
the
land
and
afterwards
carried
to
the
rivers
by
freshets
in
which
case
the
eggs
and
seeds
of
land
insects
and
plants
might
be
accidentally
introduced
and
safely
enclosed
with
particles
of
earth
in
their
cavities
as
the
speed
of
the
current
in
the
rainy
season
has
been
observed
to
be
from
three
to
five
miles
an
hour
they
might
travel
an
immense
distance
before
the
eggs
or
seeds
were
destroyed
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
neglected
the
opportunity
while
on
the
spot
of
ascertaining
whether
this
was
actually
the
case
the
attention
of
naturalists
has
only
lately
been
turned
to
the
important
subject
of
occasional
means
of
wide
dissemination
of
species
of
animals
and
plants
unless
such
be
shown
to
exist
it
is
impossible
to
solve
some
of
the
most
difficult
problems
connected
with
the
distribution
of
plants
and
animals
some
species
with
most
limited
powers
of
locomotion
are
found
in
opposite
parts
of
the
earth
without
existing
in
the
intermediate
regions
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
these
may
have
migrated
or
been
accidentally
transported
from
one
point
to
the
other
we
shall
have
to
come
to
the
strange
conclusion
that
the
same
species
had
been
created
in
two
separate
districts
canoemen
on
the
upper
amazons
live
in
constant
dread
of
the
terras
cahidas
or
landslips
which
occasionally
take
place
along
the
steep
earthy
banks
especially
when
the
waters
are
rising
large
vessels
are
sometimes
overwhelmed
by
these
avalanches
of
earth
and
trees
i
should
have
thought
the
accounts
of
them
exaggerated
if
i
had
not
had
an
opportunity
during
this
voyage
of
seeing
one
on
a
large
scale
one
morning
i
was
awakened
before
sunrise
by
an
unusual
sound
resembling
the
roar
of
artillery
i
was
lying
alone
on
the
top
of
the
cabin
it
was
very
dark
and
all
my
companions
were
asleep
so
i
lay
listening
the
sounds
came
from
a
considerable
distance
and
the
crash
which
had
aroused
me
was
succeeded
by
others
much
less
formidable
the
first
explanation
which
occurred
to
me
was
that
it
was
an
earthquake
for
although
the
night
was
breathlessly
calm
the
broad
river
was
much
agitated
and
the
vessel
rolled
heavily
soon
after
another
loud
explosion
took
place
apparently
much
nearer
than
the
former
one
then
followed
others
the
thundering
peal
rolled
backwards
and
forwards
now
seeming
close
at
hand
now
far
off
the
sudden
crashes
being
often
succeeded
by
a
pause
or
a
long
continued
dull
rumbling
at
the
second
explosion
vicente
who
lay
snoring
by
the
helm
awoke
and
told
me
it
was
a
terra
cahida
but
i
could
scarcely
believe
him
the
day
dawned
after
the
uproar
had
lasted
about
an
hour
and
we
then
saw
the
work
of
destruction
going
forward
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
about
three
miles
off
large
masses
of
forest
including
trees
of
colossal
size
probably
feet
in
height
were
rocking
to
and
fro
and
falling
headlong
one
after
the
other
into
the
water
after
each
avalanche
the
wave
which
it
caused
returned
on
the
crumbly
bank
with
tremendous
force
and
caused
the
fall
of
other
masses
by
undermining
them
the
line
of
coast
over
which
the
landslip
extended
was
a
mile
or
two
in
length
the
end
of
it
however
was
hidden
from
our
view
by
an
intervening
island
it
was
a
grand
sight
each
downfall
created
a
cloud
of
spray
the
concussion
in
one
place
causing
other
masses
to
give
way
a
long
distance
from
it
and
thus
the
crashes
continued
swaying
to
and
fro
with
little
prospect
of
a
termination
when
we
glided
out
of
sight
two
hours
after
sunrise
the
destruction
was
still
going
on
on
the
we
threaded
the
of
one
of
the
numerous
narrow
bywaters
which
lie
conveniently
for
canoes
away
from
the
main
river
and
often
save
a
considerable
circuit
around
a
promontory
or
island
we
rowed
for
half
a
mile
through
a
magnificent
bed
of
victoria
waterlilies
the
of
which
were
just
beginning
to
expand
beyond
the
mouth
of
the
catua
a
channel
leading
to
one
of
the
great
lakes
so
numerous
in
the
plains
of
the
amazons
which
we
passed
on
the
the
river
appeared
greatly
increased
in
breadth
we
travelled
for
three
days
along
a
broad
reach
which
both
up
and
down
river
presented
a
blank
horizon
of
water
and
sky
this
clear
view
was
owing
to
the
absence
of
islands
but
it
renewed
one
impressions
of
the
magnitude
of
the
stream
which
here
miles
from
its
mouth
showed
so
little
diminution
of
width
further
westward
a
series
of
large
islands
commences
which
divides
the
river
into
two
and
sometimes
three
channels
each
about
a
mile
in
breadth
we
kept
to
the
southernmost
of
these
travelling
all
day
on
the
of
april
along
a
high
and
rather
sloping
bank
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
a
narrow
opening
which
would
be
taken
by
a
stranger
navigating
the
main
channel
for
the
cutlet
of
some
insignificant
stream
it
was
the
mouth
of
the
teffe
on
whose
banks
ega
is
situated
the
termination
of
our
voyage
after
having
struggled
for
days
with
the
muddy
currents
and
insect
pests
of
the
solimoens
it
was
unspeakably
refreshing
to
find
oneself
again
in
a
river
smooth
as
a
lake
and
free
from
pium
and
motuca
the
rounded
outline
small
foliage
and
of
the
woods
which
seemed
to
rest
on
the
glassy
waters
made
a
pleasant
contrast
to
the
tumultuous
piles
of
rank
glaring
vegetation
and
torn
banks
to
which
we
had
been
so
long
accustomed
on
the
main
river
the
men
rowed
lazily
until
nightfall
when
having
done
a
laborious
work
they
discontinued
and
went
to
sleep
intending
to
make
for
ega
in
the
morning
it
was
not
thought
worthwhile
to
secure
the
vessel
to
the
trees
or
cast
anchor
as
there
was
no
current
i
sat
up
for
two
or
three
hours
after
my
companions
had
gone
to
rest
enjoying
the
solemn
calm
of
the
night
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
the
sky
was
of
a
deep
blue
and
the
stars
seemed
to
stand
forth
in
sharp
relief
there
was
no
sound
of
life
in
the
woods
except
the
occasional
melancholy
note
of
some
nocturnal
bird
i
reflected
on
my
own
wandering
life
i
had
now
reached
the
end
of
the
third
stage
of
my
journey
and
was
now
more
than
half
way
across
the
continent
it
was
necessary
for
me
on
many
accounts
to
find
a
rich
locality
for
natural
history
explorations
and
settle
myself
in
it
for
some
months
or
years
would
the
neighbourhood
of
ega
turn
out
to
be
suitable
and
should
i
a
solitary
stranger
on
a
strange
errand
find
a
welcome
amongst
its
people
our
indians
resumed
their
oars
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
may
and
after
an
hour
rowing
along
the
narrow
channel
which
varies
in
breadth
from
to
yards
we
doubled
a
low
wooded
point
and
emerged
suddenly
on
the
lake
of
ega
a
magnificent
sheet
of
water
five
miles
broad
the
expanded
portion
of
the
teffe
it
is
quite
clear
of
islands
and
curves
away
to
the
west
and
south
so
that
its
full
extent
is
not
visible
from
this
side
to
the
left
on
a
gentle
grassy
slope
at
the
point
of
junction
of
a
broad
tributary
with
the
teffe
lay
the
little
settlement
a
cluster
of
a
hundred
or
so
of
thatched
cottages
and
houses
each
with
its
orchard
of
orange
lemon
banana
and
guava
trees
groups
of
palms
with
their
tall
slender
shafts
and
feathery
crowns
overtopped
the
buildings
and
lower
trees
a
broad
street
led
from
the
narrow
strip
of
white
sandy
beach
to
the
church
with
its
wooden
crucifix
on
the
green
before
it
in
the
centre
of
the
town
cattle
were
grazing
before
the
houses
and
a
number
of
skinned
natives
were
taking
their
morning
bath
amongst
the
canoes
of
various
sizes
which
were
anchored
or
moored
to
stakes
in
the
port
we
let
off
rockets
and
fired
salutes
according
to
custom
in
token
of
our
safe
arrival
and
shortly
afterwards
went
ashore
a
few
days
experience
of
the
people
and
the
forests
of
the
vicinity
showed
me
that
i
might
lay
myself
out
for
a
long
pleasant
and
busy
residence
at
this
place
an
idea
of
the
kind
of
people
i
had
fallen
amongst
may
be
conveyed
by
an
account
of
my
earliest
acquaintances
in
the
place
on
landing
the
owner
of
the
canoe
killed
an
ox
in
honour
of
our
arrival
and
the
next
day
took
me
round
the
town
to
introduce
me
to
the
principal
residents
we
first
went
to
the
delegado
of
police
senor
antonio
cardozo
of
whom
i
shall
have
to
make
frequent
mention
he
was
a
stout
man
ranking
as
a
white
but
having
a
tinge
of
negro
blood
his
complexion
however
was
ruddy
and
scarcely
betrayed
the
mixture
he
received
us
in
a
very
cordial
winning
manner
i
had
afterwards
occasion
to
be
astonished
at
the
boundless
good
nature
of
this
excellent
fellow
whose
greatest
pleasure
seemed
to
be
to
make
sacrifices
for
his
friends
he
was
a
paraense
and
came
to
ega
originally
as
a
trader
but
not
succeeding
in
this
he
turned
planter
on
a
small
scale
and
collector
of
the
natural
commodities
of
the
country
employing
indians
in
the
business
we
then
visited
the
military
commandant
an
officer
in
the
brazilian
army
named
praia
he
was
breakfasting
with
the
vicar
and
we
found
the
two
in
dishabille
loose
round
the
neck
and
slippers
seated
at
a
rude
wooden
table
in
an
open
verandah
at
the
back
of
the
house
commander
praia
was
a
little
man
also
somewhat
of
a
mulatto
always
merry
and
fond
of
practical
jokes
his
wife
donna
anna
a
dressy
dame
from
santarem
was
the
leader
of
fashion
in
the
settlement
the
vicar
father
luiz
gonsalvo
gomez
was
a
nearly
pureblood
indian
a
native
of
one
of
the
neighbouring
villages
but
educated
at
maranham
a
city
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
i
afterwards
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
as
he
was
an
agreeable
sociable
fellow
fond
of
reading
and
hearing
about
foreign
countries
and
quite
free
from
the
prejudices
which
might
be
expected
in
a
man
of
his
profession
i
found
him
moreover
a
thoroughly
upright
sincere
and
virtuous
man
he
supported
his
aged
mother
and
unmarried
sisters
in
a
very
creditable
way
out
of
his
small
salary
and
emoluments
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
speak
in
these
terms
of
a
brazilian
priest
for
the
opportunity
occurs
rarely
enough
leaving
these
agreeable
new
acquaintances
to
finish
their
breakfast
we
next
called
on
the
director
of
the
indians
of
the
japura
senor
jose
chrysostomo
monteiro
a
thin
wiry
mameluco
the
most
enterprising
person
in
the
settlement
each
of
the
neighbouring
rivers
with
its
numerous
wild
tribes
is
under
the
control
of
a
director
who
is
nominated
by
the
imperial
government
there
are
now
no
missions
in
the
regions
of
the
upper
amazons
the
gentios
heathens
or
unbaptised
indians
being
considered
under
the
management
and
protection
of
these
despots
who
like
the
captains
of
trabalhadores
before
mentioned
use
the
natives
for
their
own
private
ends
senor
chrysostomo
had
at
this
time
of
the
japura
indians
in
his
employ
he
was
half
indian
himself
but
was
a
far
worse
master
to
the
redskins
than
the
whites
usually
are
we
finished
our
rounds
by
paying
our
respects
to
a
venerable
native
merchant
senor
romao
de
oliveira
a
tall
corpulent
old
man
who
received
us
with
a
naive
courtesy
quite
original
in
its
way
he
had
been
an
industrious
enterprising
man
in
his
younger
days
and
had
built
a
substantial
range
of
houses
and
warehouses
the
shrewd
and
able
old
gentleman
knew
nothing
of
the
world
beyond
the
wilderness
of
the
solimoens
and
its
few
thousands
of
isolated
inhabitants
yet
he
could
converse
well
and
sensibly
making
observations
on
men
and
things
as
sagaciously
as
though
he
had
drawn
them
from
long
experience
of
life
in
a
european
capital
the
indians
respected
old
romao
and
he
had
consequently
a
great
number
in
his
employ
in
different
parts
of
the
river
his
vessels
were
always
filled
quicker
with
produce
than
those
of
his
neighbours
on
our
leaving
he
placed
his
house
and
store
at
my
disposal
this
was
not
a
piece
of
empty
politeness
for
some
time
afterwards
when
i
wished
to
settle
for
the
goods
i
had
had
of
him
he
refused
to
take
any
payment
i
made
ega
my
headquarters
during
the
whole
of
the
time
i
remained
on
the
upper
amazons
four
years
and
a
half
my
excursions
into
the
neighbouring
region
extended
sometimes
as
far
as
and
miles
from
the
place
an
account
of
these
excursions
will
be
given
in
subsequent
chapters
in
the
intervals
between
them
i
led
a
quiet
uneventful
life
in
the
settlement
following
my
pursuit
in
the
same
peaceful
regular
way
as
a
naturalist
might
do
in
a
european
village
for
many
weeks
in
succession
my
journal
records
little
more
than
the
notes
made
on
my
daily
captures
i
had
a
dry
and
specious
cottage
the
principal
room
of
which
was
made
a
workshop
and
study
here
a
large
table
was
placed
and
my
little
library
of
reference
arranged
on
shelves
in
rough
wooden
boxes
cages
for
drying
specimens
were
suspended
from
the
rafters
by
cords
well
anointed
to
prevent
ants
from
descending
with
a
bitter
vegetable
oil
rats
and
mice
were
kept
from
them
by
inverted
cuyas
placed
half
way
down
the
cords
i
always
kept
on
hand
a
large
portion
of
my
private
collection
which
contained
a
pair
of
each
species
and
variety
for
the
sake
of
comparing
the
old
with
the
new
acquisitions
my
cottage
was
whitewashed
inside
and
out
about
once
a
year
by
the
proprietor
a
native
trader
the
floor
was
of
earth
the
ventilation
was
perfect
for
the
outside
air
and
sometimes
the
rain
as
well
entered
freely
through
gaps
at
the
top
of
the
walls
under
the
eaves
and
through
wide
crevices
in
the
doorways
rude
as
the
dwelling
was
i
look
back
with
pleasure
on
the
many
happy
months
i
spent
in
it
i
rose
generally
with
the
sun
when
the
grassy
streets
were
wet
with
dew
and
walked
down
to
the
river
to
bathe
five
or
six
hours
of
every
morning
were
spent
in
collecting
in
the
forest
whose
borders
lay
only
five
minutes
walk
from
my
house
the
hot
hours
of
the
afternoon
between
three
and
six
and
the
rainy
days
were
occupied
in
preparing
and
ticketing
the
specimens
making
notes
dissecting
and
drawing
i
frequently
had
short
rambles
by
water
in
a
small
montaria
with
an
indian
lad
to
paddle
the
neighbourhood
yielded
me
up
to
the
last
day
of
my
residence
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
new
and
curious
forms
in
the
different
classes
of
the
animal
kingdom
and
especially
insects
i
lived
as
may
already
have
been
seen
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
inhabitants
of
ega
refined
society
of
course
there
was
none
but
the
score
or
so
of
decent
quiet
families
which
constituted
the
upper
class
of
the
place
were
very
sociable
their
manners
offered
a
curious
mixture
of
naive
rusticity
and
formal
politeness
the
great
desire
to
be
thought
civilised
leads
the
most
ignorant
of
these
people
and
they
are
all
very
ignorant
although
of
quick
intelligence
to
be
civil
and
kind
to
strangers
from
europe
i
was
never
troubled
with
that
impertinent
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
people
in
these
interior
places
which
some
travellers
complain
of
in
other
countries
the
indians
and
lower
at
least
such
of
them
who
gave
any
thought
to
the
subject
seemed
to
think
it
natural
that
strangers
should
collect
and
send
abroad
the
beautiful
birds
and
insects
of
their
country
the
butterflies
they
universally
concluded
to
be
wanted
as
patterns
for
as
to
the
better
sort
of
people
i
had
no
difficulty
in
making
them
understand
that
each
european
capital
had
a
public
museum
in
which
were
sought
to
be
stored
specimens
of
all
natural
productions
in
the
mineral
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
they
could
not
comprehend
how
a
man
could
study
science
for
its
own
sake
but
i
told
them
i
was
collecting
for
the
museo
de
londres
and
was
paid
for
it
that
was
very
intelligible
one
day
soon
after
my
arrival
when
i
was
explaining
these
things
to
a
listening
circle
seated
on
benches
in
the
grassy
street
one
of
the
audience
a
considerable
tradesman
a
mameluco
native
of
ega
got
suddenly
quite
enthusiastic
and
exclaimed
how
rich
are
these
great
nations
of
europe
we
creatures
know
nothing
let
us
treat
this
stranger
well
that
he
may
stay
amongst
us
and
teach
our
children
we
very
frequently
had
social
parties
with
dancing
and
so
forth
of
these
relaxations
i
shall
have
more
to
say
presently
the
manners
of
the
indian
population
also
gave
me
some
amusement
for
a
long
time
during
the
latter
part
of
my
residence
three
wandering
frenchmen
and
two
italians
some
of
them
men
of
good
education
on
their
road
one
after
the
other
from
the
andes
down
the
amazons
became
enamoured
of
this
delightfully
situated
and
tranquil
spot
and
made
up
their
minds
to
settle
here
for
the
remainder
of
their
lives
three
of
them
ended
by
marrying
native
women
i
found
the
society
of
these
friends
a
very
agreeable
change
there
were
of
course
many
drawbacks
to
the
amenities
of
the
place
as
a
residence
for
a
european
but
these
were
not
of
a
nature
that
my
readers
would
perhaps
imagine
there
was
scarcely
any
danger
from
wild
animals
it
seems
almost
ridiculous
to
refute
the
idea
of
danger
from
the
natives
in
a
country
where
even
incivility
to
an
unoffending
stranger
is
a
rarity
a
jaguar
however
paid
us
a
visit
one
night
it
was
considered
an
extraordinary
event
and
so
much
uproar
was
made
by
the
men
who
turned
out
with
guns
and
bows
and
arrows
that
the
animal
scampered
off
and
was
heard
of
no
more
alligators
were
rather
troublesome
in
the
dry
season
during
these
months
there
was
almost
always
one
or
two
lying
in
wait
near
the
bathing
place
for
anything
that
might
turn
up
at
the
edge
of
the
water
dog
sheep
pig
child
or
drunken
indian
when
this
visitor
was
about
every
one
took
extra
care
whilst
bathing
i
used
to
imitate
the
natives
in
not
advancing
far
from
the
bank
and
in
keeping
my
eye
fixed
on
that
of
the
monster
which
stares
with
a
disgusting
leer
along
the
surface
of
the
water
the
body
being
submerged
to
the
level
of
the
eyes
and
the
top
of
the
head
with
part
of
the
dorsal
crest
the
only
portions
visible
when
a
little
motion
was
perceived
in
the
water
behind
the
reptile
tail
bathers
were
obliged
to
beat
a
quick
retreat
i
was
never
threatened
myself
but
i
often
saw
the
crowds
of
women
and
children
scared
while
bathing
by
the
beast
making
a
movement
towards
them
a
general
scamper
to
the
shore
and
peals
of
laughter
were
always
the
result
in
these
cases
the
men
can
always
destroy
these
alligators
when
they
like
to
take
the
trouble
to
set
out
with
montarias
and
harpoons
for
the
purpose
but
they
never
do
it
unless
one
of
the
monsters
bolder
than
usual
puts
some
one
life
in
danger
this
arouses
them
and
they
then
track
the
enemy
with
the
greatest
pertinacity
when
they
drag
it
ashore
and
dispatch
it
amid
loud
execrations
another
however
is
sure
to
appear
some
days
or
weeks
afterwards
and
take
the
vacant
place
on
the
station
besides
alligators
the
only
animals
to
be
feared
are
the
poisonous
serpents
these
are
certainly
common
enough
in
the
forest
but
no
fatal
accident
happened
during
the
whole
time
of
my
residence
i
suffered
most
inconvenience
from
the
difficulty
of
getting
news
from
the
civilised
world
down
river
from
the
irregularity
of
receipt
of
letters
parcels
of
books
and
periodicals
and
towards
the
latter
part
of
my
residence
from
ill
health
arising
from
bad
and
insufficient
food
the
want
of
intellectual
society
and
of
the
varied
excitement
of
european
life
was
also
felt
most
acutely
and
this
instead
of
becoming
deadened
by
time
increased
until
it
became
almost
insupportable
i
was
obliged
at
last
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
contemplation
of
nature
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
fill
the
human
heart
and
mind
i
got
on
pretty
well
when
i
received
a
parcel
from
england
by
the
steamer
once
in
two
or
four
months
i
used
to
be
very
economical
with
my
stock
of
reading
lest
it
should
be
finished
before
the
next
arrival
and
leave
me
utterly
destitute
i
went
over
the
periodicals
the
athenaeum
for
instance
with
great
deliberation
going
through
every
number
three
times
the
first
time
devouring
the
more
interesting
articles
the
second
the
whole
of
the
remainder
and
the
third
reading
all
the
advertisements
from
beginning
to
end
if
four
months
two
steamers
passed
without
a
fresh
parcel
i
felt
discouraged
in
the
extreme
i
was
worst
off
in
the
first
year
when
twelve
months
elapsed
without
letters
or
remittances
towards
the
end
of
this
time
my
clothes
had
worn
to
rags
i
was
barefoot
a
great
inconvenience
in
tropical
forests
notwithstanding
statements
to
the
contrary
that
have
been
published
by
travellers
my
servant
ran
away
and
i
was
robbed
of
nearly
all
my
copper
money
i
was
obliged
then
to
descend
to
para
but
returned
after
finishing
the
examination
of
the
middle
part
of
the
lower
amazons
and
the
tapajos
in
with
my
santarem
assistant
and
better
provided
for
making
collections
on
the
upper
river
this
second
visit
was
in
pursuit
of
the
plan
before
mentioned
of
exploring
in
detail
the
whole
valley
of
the
amazons
which
i
formed
in
para
in
the
year
during
so
long
a
residence
i
witnessed
of
course
many
changes
in
the
place
some
of
the
good
friends
who
made
me
welcome
on
my
first
arrival
died
and
i
followed
their
remains
to
their
last
in
the
little
rustic
cemetery
on
the
borders
of
the
surrounding
forest
i
lived
there
long
enough
from
first
to
last
to
see
the
young
people
grow
up
attended
their
weddings
and
the
christenings
of
their
children
and
before
i
left
saw
them
old
married
folks
with
numerous
families
in
ega
was
only
a
village
dependent
on
para
miles
distant
as
the
capital
of
the
then
undivided
province
in
with
the
creation
of
the
new
province
of
the
amazons
it
became
a
city
returned
its
members
to
the
provincial
parliament
at
barra
had
it
assizes
its
resident
judges
and
rose
to
be
the
chief
town
of
the
comarca
or
county
a
year
after
this
namely
in
steamers
were
introduced
on
the
solimoens
and
from
one
ran
regularly
every
two
months
between
the
rio
negro
and
nauta
in
peru
touching
at
all
the
villages
and
accomplishing
the
distance
in
ascending
about
miles
in
eighteen
days
the
trade
and
population
however
did
not
increase
with
these
changes
the
people
became
more
civilised
that
is
they
began
to
dress
according
to
the
latest
parisian
fashions
instead
of
going
about
in
stockingless
feet
wooden
clogs
and
shirt
sleeves
acquired
a
taste
for
and
became
divided
into
parties
and
lost
part
of
their
former
simplicity
of
manners
but
the
place
remained
when
i
left
it
in
pretty
nearly
what
it
was
when
i
first
arrived
in
a
village
with
much
in
the
ways
and
notions
of
its
people
more
like
those
of
a
small
country
town
in
northern
europe
than
a
south
american
settlement
the
place
is
healthy
and
almost
free
from
insect
pests
perpetual
verdure
surrounds
it
the
soil
is
of
marvellous
fertility
even
for
brazil
the
endless
rivers
and
labyrinths
of
channels
teem
with
fish
and
turtle
a
fleet
of
steamers
might
anchor
at
any
season
of
the
year
in
the
lake
which
has
uninterrupted
water
communication
straight
to
the
atlantic
what
a
future
is
in
store
for
the
sleepy
little
tropical
village
after
speaking
of
ega
as
a
city
it
will
have
a
ludicrous
effect
to
mention
that
the
total
number
of
its
inhabitants
is
only
about
it
contains
just
houses
about
half
of
which
are
miserably
built
cottages
thatched
with
palm
leaves
a
fourth
of
the
population
are
almost
always
absent
trading
or
collecting
produce
on
the
rivers
the
neighbourhood
within
a
radius
of
thirty
miles
and
including
two
other
small
villages
contains
probably
more
people
the
settlement
is
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
country
having
beenfounded
in
by
father
samuel
fritz
a
bohemian
jesuit
who
induced
several
of
the
docile
tribes
of
indians
then
scattered
over
the
neighbouring
region
to
settle
on
the
site
from
to
acres
of
sloping
ground
around
the
place
were
afterwards
cleared
of
timber
but
such
is
the
encroaching
vigour
of
vegetation
in
this
country
that
the
site
would
quickly
relapse
into
jungle
if
the
inhabitants
neglected
to
pull
up
the
young
shoots
as
they
arose
there
is
a
stringent
municipal
law
which
compels
each
resident
to
weed
a
given
space
around
his
dwelling
every
month
whilst
i
resided
here
an
inspector
came
round
with
his
wand
of
authority
and
fined
every
one
who
had
not
complied
with
the
regulation
the
indians
of
the
surrounding
country
have
never
been
hostile
to
the
european
settlers
the
rebels
of
para
and
the
lower
amazons
in
did
not
succeed
in
rousing
the
natives
of
the
solimoens
against
the
whites
a
party
of
forty
of
them
ascended
the
river
for
that
purpose
but
on
arriving
at
ega
instead
of
meeting
with
sympathisers
as
in
other
places
they
were
surrounded
by
a
small
body
of
armed
residents
and
shot
down
without
mercy
the
military
commandant
at
the
time
who
was
the
prime
mover
in
this
orderly
resistance
to
anarchy
was
a
courageous
and
loyal
negro
named
jose
patricio
an
officer
known
throughout
the
upper
amazons
for
his
unflinching
honesty
and
love
of
order
whose
acquaintance
i
had
the
pleasure
of
making
at
paulo
in
ega
was
the
headquarters
of
the
great
scientific
commission
which
met
in
the
years
from
to
to
settle
the
boundaries
between
the
spanish
and
portuguese
territories
in
south
america
the
chief
commissioner
for
spain
don
francisco
requena
lived
some
time
in
the
village
with
his
family
i
found
only
one
person
at
ega
my
old
friend
romao
de
oliveira
who
recollected
or
had
any
knowledge
of
this
important
time
when
a
numerous
staff
of
astronomers
surveyors
and
draughtsmen
explored
much
of
the
surrounding
country
with
large
bodies
of
soldiers
and
natives
more
than
half
the
inhabitants
of
ega
are
mamelucos
there
are
not
more
than
forty
or
fifty
pure
whites
the
number
of
negroes
and
mulattos
is
probably
a
little
less
and
the
rest
of
the
population
consists
of
pure
blood
indians
every
householder
including
indians
and
free
negroes
is
entitled
to
a
vote
in
the
elections
municipal
provincial
and
imperial
and
is
liable
to
be
called
on
juries
and
to
serve
in
the
national
guard
these
privileges
and
duties
of
citizenship
do
not
seem
at
present
to
be
appreciated
by
the
more
ignorant
coloured
people
there
is
however
a
gradual
improvement
taking
place
in
this
respect
before
i
left
there
was
a
rather
sharp
contest
for
the
presidency
of
the
municipal
chamber
and
most
of
the
voters
took
a
lively
interest
in
it
there
was
also
an
election
of
members
to
represent
the
province
in
the
imperial
parliament
at
rio
janeiro
in
which
each
party
strove
hard
to
return
its
candidate
on
this
occasion
an
unscrupulous
lawyer
was
sent
by
the
government
party
from
the
capital
to
overawe
the
opposition
to
its
nominee
many
of
the
headed
by
my
old
friend
john
da
cunha
who
was
then
settled
at
ega
fought
hard
but
with
perfect
legality
and
good
humour
against
this
powerful
interest
they
did
not
succeed
and
although
the
government
agent
committed
many
tyrannical
and
illegal
acts
the
losing
party
submitted
quietly
to
their
defeat
in
a
larger
town
i
believe
the
government
would
not
have
dared
to
attempt
thus
to
control
the
elections
i
think
i
saw
enough
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
the
machinery
of
constitutional
government
would
with
a
little
longer
trial
work
well
amongst
the
mixed
indian
white
and
negro
population
even
in
this
remote
part
of
the
brazilian
empire
i
attended
also
before
i
left
several
assize
meetings
at
ega
and
witnessed
the
novel
sight
of
negro
white
and
indian
sitting
gravely
side
by
side
on
the
jury
bench
the
way
in
which
the
coloured
races
act
under
the
conditions
of
free
citizenship
is
a
very
interesting
subject
brazilian
statesmen
seem
to
have
abandoned
the
idea
if
they
ever
entertained
it
of
making
this
tropical
empire
a
nation
of
whites
with
a
slave
labouring
class
the
greatest
difficulty
on
the
amazons
is
with
the
indians
the
general
inflexibility
of
character
of
the
race
and
their
abhorrence
of
the
restraints
of
civilised
life
make
them
very
intractable
subjects
some
of
them
however
who
have
learned
to
read
and
write
and
whose
dislike
to
live
in
towns
has
been
overcome
by
some
cause
acting
early
in
life
make
very
good
citizens
i
have
already
mentioned
the
priest
who
is
a
good
example
of
what
early
training
can
do
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
the
docile
amazonian
indians
were
kindly
treated
by
their
white
and
educated
they
would
not
be
so
quick
as
they
have
hitherto
shown
themselves
to
be
to
leave
the
towns
and
return
into
their
half
wild
condition
on
the
advancing
civilisation
of
the
places
the
inflexibility
of
character
although
probably
organic
is
seen
to
be
sometimes
overcome
the
principal
blacksmith
of
ega
senor
macedo
was
also
an
indian
and
a
very
sensible
fellow
he
sometimes
filled
minor
offices
in
the
government
of
the
place
he
used
to
come
very
frequently
to
my
house
to
chat
and
was
always
striving
to
acquire
solid
information
about
things
when
donati
comet
appeared
he
took
a
great
interest
in
it
we
saw
it
at
its
best
from
the
to
the
of
october
between
which
dates
it
was
visible
near
the
western
horizon
just
after
sunset
the
tail
extending
in
a
broad
curve
towards
the
north
and
forming
a
sublime
object
macedo
consulted
all
the
old
almanacs
in
the
place
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
the
same
comet
as
that
of
which
he
said
he
well
remembered
before
the
indians
can
be
reclaimed
in
large
numbers
it
is
most
likely
they
will
become
extinct
as
a
race
but
there
is
less
difficulty
with
regard
to
the
mamelucos
who
even
when
the
proportion
of
white
blood
is
small
sometimes
become
enterprising
and
versatile
of
the
ega
indians
including
all
the
domestic
servants
are
savages
who
have
been
brought
from
the
neighbouring
rivers
the
japura
the
issa
and
the
solimoens
i
saw
here
individuals
of
at
least
sixteen
different
tribes
most
of
whom
had
been
bought
when
children
of
the
native
chiefs
this
species
of
although
forbidden
by
the
laws
of
brazil
is
winked
at
by
the
authorities
because
without
it
there
would
be
no
means
of
obtaining
servants
they
all
become
their
own
masters
when
they
grow
up
and
never
show
the
slightest
inclination
to
return
to
utter
savage
life
but
the
boys
generally
run
away
and
embark
on
the
canoes
of
traders
and
the
girls
are
often
badly
treated
by
their
mistresses
the
jealous
passionate
and
brazilian
women
nearly
all
the
enmities
which
arise
amongst
residents
at
ega
and
other
place
are
caused
by
disputes
about
indian
servants
no
one
who
has
lived
only
in
old
settled
countries
where
service
can
be
readily
bought
can
imagine
the
difficulties
and
annoyances
of
a
land
where
the
servant
class
are
ignorant
of
the
value
of
money
and
hands
can
not
be
obtained
except
by
coaxing
them
from
the
employ
of
other
masters
great
mortality
takes
place
amongst
the
poor
captive
children
on
their
arrival
at
ega
it
is
a
singular
circumstance
that
the
indians
residing
on
the
japura
and
other
tributaries
always
fall
ill
on
descending
to
the
solimoens
while
the
reverse
takes
place
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
banks
of
the
main
river
who
never
fail
of
taking
intermittent
fever
when
they
first
ascend
these
branch
rivers
and
of
getting
well
when
they
return
the
finest
tribes
of
savages
who
inhabit
the
country
near
ega
are
the
juris
and
passes
these
are
now
however
nearly
extinct
a
few
families
only
remaining
on
the
banks
of
the
retired
creeks
connected
with
the
teffe
and
on
other
branch
rivers
between
the
teffe
and
the
jutahi
they
are
a
peaceable
gentle
and
industrious
people
devoted
to
agriculture
and
fishing
and
have
always
been
friendly
to
the
whites
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
again
of
the
passes
who
are
a
and
superior
race
of
indians
distinguished
by
a
large
square
tattooed
patch
in
the
middle
of
their
faces
the
principal
cause
of
their
decay
in
numbers
seems
to
be
a
disease
which
always
appears
amongst
them
when
a
village
is
visited
by
people
from
the
civilised
settlements
a
slow
fever
accompanied
by
the
symptoms
of
a
common
cold
defluxo
as
the
brazilians
term
it
ending
probably
in
consumption
the
disorder
has
been
known
to
break
out
when
the
visitors
were
entirely
free
from
it
the
simple
contact
of
civilised
men
in
some
mysterious
way
being
sufficient
to
create
it
it
is
generally
fatal
to
the
juris
and
passes
the
first
question
the
poor
patient
indians
now
put
to
an
advancing
canoe
is
do
you
bring
defluxo
my
assistant
jose
in
the
last
year
of
our
residence
at
ega
resgatou
ransomed
the
euphemism
in
use
for
purchased
two
indian
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
through
a
japura
trader
the
boy
was
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
of
an
unusually
dark
colour
of
skin
he
had
in
fact
the
tint
of
a
cafuzo
the
offspring
of
indian
and
negro
it
was
thought
he
had
belonged
to
some
perfectly
wild
and
houseless
tribe
similar
to
the
pararauates
of
the
tapajos
of
which
there
are
several
in
different
parts
of
the
interior
of
south
america
his
face
was
of
regular
oval
shape
but
his
glistening
black
eyes
had
a
wary
distrustful
expression
like
that
of
a
wild
animal
his
hands
and
feet
were
small
and
delicately
formed
soon
after
his
arrival
finding
that
none
of
the
indian
boys
and
girls
in
the
houses
of
our
neighbours
understood
his
language
he
became
sulky
and
reserved
not
a
word
could
be
got
from
him
until
many
weeks
afterwards
when
he
suddenly
broke
out
with
complete
phrases
of
portuguese
he
was
ill
of
swollen
liver
and
spleen
the
result
of
intermittent
fever
for
a
long
time
after
coming
into
our
hands
we
found
it
difficult
to
cure
him
owing
to
his
almost
invincible
habit
of
eating
earth
baked
clay
pitch
wax
and
other
similar
substances
very
many
children
on
the
upper
parts
of
the
amazons
have
this
strange
habit
not
only
indians
but
negroes
and
whites
it
is
not
therefore
peculiar
to
the
famous
otomacs
of
the
orinoco
described
by
humboldt
or
to
indians
at
all
and
seems
to
originate
in
a
morbid
craving
the
result
of
a
meagre
diet
of
fish
and
we
gave
our
little
savage
the
name
of
sebastian
the
use
of
these
indian
children
is
to
fill
from
the
river
gather
firewood
in
the
forest
cook
assist
in
paddling
the
montaria
in
excursions
and
so
forth
sebastian
was
often
my
companion
in
the
woods
where
he
was
very
useful
in
finding
the
small
birds
i
shot
which
sometimes
fell
in
the
thickets
amongst
confused
masses
of
fallen
branches
and
dead
leaves
he
was
wonderfully
expert
at
catching
lizards
with
his
hands
and
at
climbing
the
smoothest
stems
of
palm
trees
offered
little
difficulty
to
him
he
would
gather
a
few
lengths
of
tough
flexible
lianas
tie
them
in
a
short
endless
band
to
support
his
feet
with
in
embracing
the
slippery
shaft
and
then
mount
upwards
by
a
succession
of
slight
jerks
it
was
very
amusing
during
the
first
few
weeks
to
witness
the
glee
and
pride
with
which
he
would
bring
to
me
the
bunches
of
fruit
he
had
gathered
from
almost
inaccessible
trees
he
avoided
the
company
of
boys
of
his
own
race
and
was
evidently
proud
of
being
the
servant
of
a
real
white
man
we
brought
him
down
with
us
to
para
but
he
showed
no
emotion
at
any
of
the
strange
sights
of
the
capital
the
large
ships
and
houses
horses
and
carriages
the
pomp
of
church
ceremonies
and
so
forth
in
this
he
exhibited
the
usual
dullness
of
feeling
and
poverty
of
thought
of
the
indian
he
had
nevertheless
very
keen
perceptions
and
was
quick
at
learning
any
mechanical
art
jose
who
had
resumed
some
time
before
i
left
the
country
his
old
trade
of
goldsmith
made
him
his
apprentice
and
he
made
very
rapid
progress
for
after
about
three
months
teaching
he
came
to
me
one
day
with
radiant
countenance
and
showed
me
a
gold
ring
of
his
own
making
the
fate
of
the
little
girl
who
came
with
a
second
batch
of
children
all
ill
of
intermittent
fever
a
month
or
two
after
sebastian
was
very
different
she
was
brought
to
our
house
after
landing
one
night
in
the
wet
season
when
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
thin
and
haggard
drenched
with
wet
and
shivering
with
ague
an
old
indian
who
brought
her
to
the
door
said
briefly
ecui
encommenda
here
your
little
parcel
or
order
and
went
away
there
was
very
little
of
the
savage
in
her
appearance
and
she
was
of
a
much
lighter
colour
than
the
boy
we
found
she
was
of
the
miranha
tribe
all
of
whom
are
distinguished
by
a
slit
cut
in
the
middle
of
each
wing
of
the
nose
in
which
they
wear
on
holiday
occasions
a
large
button
made
of
pearly
we
took
the
greatest
care
of
our
little
patient
had
the
best
nurses
in
the
town
fomented
her
daily
gave
her
quinine
and
the
most
nourishing
food
but
it
was
all
of
no
avail
she
sank
rapidly
her
liver
was
enormously
swollen
and
almost
as
hard
to
the
touch
as
stone
there
was
something
uncommonly
pleasing
in
her
ways
and
quite
unlike
anything
i
had
yet
seen
in
indians
instead
of
being
dull
and
taciturn
she
was
always
smiling
and
full
of
talk
we
had
an
old
woman
of
the
same
tribe
to
attend
her
who
explained
what
she
said
to
us
she
often
begged
to
be
taken
to
the
river
to
bathe
asked
for
fruit
or
coveted
articles
she
saw
in
the
room
for
playthings
her
native
name
was
oria
the
last
week
or
two
she
could
not
rise
from
the
bed
we
had
made
for
her
in
a
dry
corner
of
the
room
when
she
wanted
lifting
which
was
very
often
she
would
allow
no
one
to
help
her
but
me
calling
me
by
the
name
of
cariwa
white
man
the
only
word
of
tupi
she
seemed
to
know
it
was
inexpressibly
touching
to
hear
her
as
she
lay
repeating
by
the
hour
the
verses
which
she
had
been
taught
to
recite
with
her
companions
in
her
native
village
a
few
sentences
repeated
over
and
over
again
with
a
rhythmic
accent
and
relating
to
objects
and
incidents
connected
with
the
wild
life
of
her
tribe
we
had
her
baptised
before
she
died
and
when
this
latter
event
happened
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
of
the
big
people
of
ega
i
insisted
on
burying
her
with
the
same
honours
as
a
child
of
the
whites
that
is
as
an
anjinho
little
angel
according
to
the
pretty
roman
catholic
custom
of
the
country
we
had
the
corpse
clothed
in
a
robe
of
fine
calico
crossed
her
hands
on
her
breast
over
a
palma
of
flowers
and
made
also
a
crown
of
flowers
for
her
head
scores
of
helpless
children
like
our
poor
oria
die
at
ega
or
on
the
road
but
generally
not
the
slightest
care
is
taken
of
them
during
their
illness
they
are
the
captives
made
during
the
merciless
raids
of
one
section
of
the
miranha
tribe
on
the
territories
of
another
and
sold
to
the
ega
traders
the
villages
of
the
attacked
hordes
are
surprised
and
the
men
and
women
killed
or
driven
into
the
thickets
without
having
time
to
save
their
children
there
appears
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
miranhas
are
cannibals
and
therefore
the
purchase
of
these
captives
probably
saves
them
from
a
worse
fate
the
demand
for
them
at
ega
operates
however
as
a
direct
cause
of
the
supply
stimulating
the
unscrupulous
chiefs
who
receive
all
the
profits
to
undertake
these
murderous
expeditions
it
is
remarkable
how
quickly
the
savages
of
the
various
nations
which
each
have
their
own
to
all
appearance
widely
different
language
learn
tupi
on
their
arrival
at
ega
where
it
is
the
common
idiom
this
perhaps
may
be
attributed
chiefly
to
the
grammatical
forms
of
all
the
indian
tongues
being
the
same
although
the
words
are
different
as
far
as
i
could
learn
the
feature
is
common
to
all
of
placing
the
preposition
after
the
noun
making
it
in
fact
a
thus
he
is
come
the
village
from
go
him
with
the
plantation
to
and
so
forth
the
ideas
to
be
expressed
in
their
limited
sphere
of
life
and
thought
are
few
consequently
the
stock
of
words
is
extremely
small
besides
all
indians
have
the
same
way
of
thinking
and
the
same
objects
to
talk
about
these
circumstances
also
contribute
to
the
case
with
which
they
learn
each
language
hordes
of
the
same
tribe
living
on
the
same
branch
rivers
speak
mutually
unintelligible
languages
this
happens
with
the
miranhas
on
the
japura
and
with
the
collinas
on
the
jurua
whilst
tupi
is
spoken
with
little
corruption
along
the
banks
of
the
main
amazons
for
a
distance
of
miles
the
purity
of
tupi
is
kept
up
by
frequent
communication
amongst
the
natives
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
main
river
how
complete
and
must
be
the
isolation
in
which
the
small
groups
of
savages
have
lived
in
other
parts
to
have
caused
so
complete
a
segregation
of
dialects
it
is
probable
that
the
strange
inflexibility
of
the
indian
organisation
both
bodily
and
mental
is
owing
to
the
isolation
in
which
each
small
tribe
has
lived
and
to
the
narrow
round
of
life
and
thought
and
close
intermarriages
for
countless
generations
which
are
the
necessary
results
their
fecundity
is
of
a
low
degree
for
it
is
very
rare
to
find
an
indian
family
having
so
many
as
four
children
and
we
have
seen
how
great
is
their
liability
to
sickness
and
death
on
removal
from
place
to
place
i
have
already
remarked
on
the
different
way
in
which
the
climate
of
this
equatorial
region
affects
indians
and
negroes
no
one
could
live
long
amongst
the
indians
of
the
upper
amazons
without
being
struck
with
their
constitutional
dislike
to
the
heat
europeans
certainly
withstand
the
high
temperature
better
than
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
country
i
always
found
i
could
myself
bear
exposure
to
the
sun
or
unusually
hot
weather
quite
as
well
as
the
indians
although
not
by
nature
for
a
hot
climate
their
skin
is
always
hot
to
the
touch
and
they
perspire
little
no
indian
resident
of
ega
can
be
induced
to
stay
in
the
village
where
the
heat
is
felt
more
than
in
the
forest
or
on
the
river
for
many
days
together
they
bathe
many
times
a
day
but
do
not
plunge
in
the
water
taking
merely
a
as
dogs
may
be
seen
doing
in
hot
climates
to
cool
the
lower
parts
of
the
body
the
women
and
children
who
often
remain
at
home
while
the
men
are
out
for
many
days
together
fishing
generally
find
some
excuse
for
trooping
off
to
the
shades
of
the
forest
in
the
hot
hours
of
the
afternoons
they
are
restless
and
discontented
in
fine
dry
weather
but
cheerful
in
cool
days
when
the
rain
is
pouring
down
on
their
naked
backs
when
suffering
under
fever
nothing
but
strict
watching
can
prevent
them
from
going
down
to
bathe
in
the
river
or
eating
immoderate
quantities
of
juicy
fruits
although
these
indulgences
are
frequently
the
cause
of
death
they
are
very
subject
to
disorders
of
the
liver
dysentery
and
other
diseases
of
hot
climates
and
when
any
epidemic
is
about
they
fall
ill
quicker
and
suffer
more
than
negroes
or
even
whites
how
different
all
this
is
with
the
negro
the
true
child
of
tropical
climes
the
impression
gradually
forced
itself
on
my
mind
that
the
red
indian
lives
as
a
stranger
or
immigrant
in
these
hot
regions
and
that
his
constitution
was
not
originally
adapted
and
has
not
since
become
perfectly
adapted
to
the
climate
the
indian
element
is
very
prominent
in
the
amusements
of
the
ega
people
all
the
roman
catholic
holidays
are
kept
up
with
great
spirit
rude
indian
sports
being
mingled
with
the
ceremonies
introduced
by
the
portuguese
besides
these
the
aborigines
celebrate
their
own
ruder
festivals
the
people
of
different
tribes
combining
for
in
most
of
their
features
the
makings
were
originally
alike
in
all
the
tribes
the
indian
idea
of
a
holiday
is
bonfires
processions
masquerading
especially
the
mimicry
of
different
kinds
of
animals
plenty
of
confused
drumming
and
fifing
monotonous
dancing
kept
up
hour
after
hour
without
intermission
and
the
most
important
point
of
all
getting
gradually
and
completely
drunk
but
he
attaches
a
kind
of
superstitious
significance
to
these
acts
and
thinks
that
the
amusements
appended
to
the
roman
catholic
holidays
as
celebrated
by
the
descendants
of
the
portuguese
are
also
an
essential
part
of
the
religious
ceremonies
but
in
this
respect
the
uneducated
whites
and
are
not
a
bit
more
enlightened
than
the
poor
indian
all
look
upon
a
religious
holiday
as
an
amusement
in
which
the
priest
takes
the
part
of
director
or
chief
actor
almost
every
unusual
event
independent
of
saints
days
is
made
the
occasion
of
a
holiday
by
the
sociable
people
of
the
white
and
mameluco
classes
funerals
christenings
weddings
the
arrival
of
strangers
and
so
forth
the
custom
of
waking
the
dead
is
also
kept
up
a
few
days
after
i
arrived
i
was
awoke
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
moist
night
by
cardozo
to
sit
up
with
a
neighbour
whose
wife
had
just
died
i
found
the
body
laid
out
on
a
table
with
crucifix
and
lighted
at
the
head
and
the
room
full
of
women
and
girls
squatted
on
stools
or
on
their
haunches
the
men
were
seated
round
the
open
door
smoking
drinking
coffee
and
telling
stories
the
bereaved
husband
exerting
himself
much
to
keep
the
people
merry
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
the
ega
people
seem
to
like
an
excuse
for
turning
night
into
day
it
is
so
cool
and
pleasant
and
they
can
sit
about
during
these
hours
in
the
open
air
clad
as
usual
in
simple
shirt
and
trousers
without
streaming
with
perspiration
the
patron
saint
is
santa
theresa
the
festival
at
whose
anniversary
lasts
like
most
of
the
others
ten
days
it
begins
very
quietly
with
evening
litanies
sung
in
the
church
which
are
attended
by
the
greater
part
of
the
population
all
clean
and
gaily
dressed
in
calicos
and
muslins
the
girls
wearing
jasmines
and
other
natural
flowers
in
their
hair
no
other
headdress
being
worn
by
females
of
any
class
the
evenings
pass
pleasantly
the
church
is
lighted
up
with
wax
candles
and
illuminated
on
the
outside
by
a
great
number
of
little
oil
lamps
rude
clay
cups
or
halves
of
the
thick
rind
of
the
bitter
orange
which
are
fixed
all
over
the
front
the
congregation
seem
very
attentive
and
the
responses
to
the
litany
of
our
lady
sung
by
a
couple
of
hundred
fresh
female
voices
ring
agreeably
through
the
still
village
towards
the
end
of
the
festival
the
fun
commences
the
managers
of
the
feast
keep
open
houses
and
dancing
drumming
tinkling
of
wire
guitars
and
unbridled
drinking
by
both
sexes
old
and
young
are
kept
up
for
a
couple
of
days
and
a
night
with
little
intermission
the
ways
of
the
people
at
these
of
which
there
are
many
in
the
course
of
the
year
always
struck
me
as
being
not
greatly
different
from
those
seen
at
an
fashioned
village
wake
in
retired
parts
of
england
the
old
folks
look
on
and
get
very
talkative
over
their
cups
the
children
are
allowed
a
little
extra
indulgence
in
sitting
up
the
dull
reserved
fellows
become
loquacious
shake
one
another
by
the
hand
or
slap
each
other
on
the
back
discovering
all
at
once
what
capital
friends
they
are
the
cantankerous
individual
gets
quarrelsome
and
the
amorous
unusually
loving
the
indian
ordinarily
so
taciturn
finds
the
use
of
his
tongue
and
gives
the
minutest
details
of
some
little
dispute
which
he
had
with
his
master
years
ago
and
which
everyone
else
had
forgotten
just
as
i
have
known
lumpish
labouring
men
in
england
do
when
fuddled
one
can
not
help
reflecting
when
witnessing
these
traits
of
manners
on
the
similarity
of
human
nature
everywhere
when
classes
are
compared
whose
state
of
culture
and
conditions
of
life
are
pretty
nearly
the
same
the
indians
play
a
conspicuous
part
in
the
amusements
at
john
eve
and
at
one
or
two
other
holidays
which
happen
about
that
time
of
the
year
the
end
of
june
in
some
of
the
sports
the
portuguese
element
is
visible
in
others
the
indian
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
masquerading
recitative
singing
and
so
forth
are
common
originally
to
both
peoples
a
large
number
of
men
and
boys
disguise
themselves
to
represent
different
grotesque
figures
animals
or
persons
two
or
three
dress
themselves
up
as
giants
with
the
help
of
a
tall
framework
one
enacts
the
part
of
the
caypor
a
kind
of
sylvan
deity
similar
to
the
curupira
which
i
have
before
mentioned
the
belief
in
this
being
seems
to
be
common
to
all
the
tribes
of
the
tupi
stock
according
to
the
figure
they
dressed
up
at
ega
he
is
a
bulky
misshapen
monster
with
red
skin
and
long
shaggy
red
hair
hanging
half
way
down
his
back
they
believe
that
he
has
subterranean
campos
and
hunting
grounds
in
the
forest
well
stocked
with
pacas
and
deer
he
is
not
at
all
an
object
of
worship
nor
of
fear
except
to
children
being
considered
merely
as
a
kind
of
hobgoblin
most
of
the
masquers
make
themselves
up
as
animals
bulls
deer
magoary
storks
jaguars
and
so
forth
with
the
aid
of
light
frameworks
covered
with
old
cloth
dyed
or
painted
and
shaped
according
to
the
object
represented
some
of
the
imitations
which
i
saw
were
capital
one
ingenious
fellow
arranged
an
old
piece
of
canvas
in
the
form
of
a
tapir
placed
himself
under
it
and
crawled
about
on
all
fours
he
constructed
an
elastic
nose
to
resemble
that
of
the
tapir
and
made
before
the
doors
of
the
principal
residents
such
a
good
imitation
of
the
beast
grazing
that
peals
of
laughter
greeted
him
wherever
he
went
another
man
walked
about
solitarily
masked
as
a
jabiru
crane
a
large
animal
standing
about
four
feet
high
and
mimicked
the
gait
and
habits
of
the
bird
uncommonly
well
one
year
an
indian
lad
imitated
me
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
townsfolk
he
came
the
previous
day
to
borrow
of
me
an
old
blouse
and
straw
hat
i
felt
rather
taken
in
when
i
saw
him
on
the
night
of
the
performance
rigged
out
as
an
entomologist
with
an
insect
net
hunting
bag
and
pincushion
to
make
the
imitation
complete
he
had
borrowed
the
frame
of
an
old
pair
of
spectacles
and
went
about
with
it
straddled
over
his
nose
the
jaguar
now
and
then
made
a
raid
amongst
the
crowd
of
boys
who
were
dressed
as
deer
goats
and
so
forth
the
masquers
kept
generally
together
moving
from
house
to
house
and
the
performances
were
directed
by
an
old
musician
who
sang
the
orders
and
explained
to
the
spectators
what
was
going
forward
in
a
kind
of
recitative
accompanying
himself
on
a
wire
guitar
the
mixture
of
portuguese
and
indian
customs
is
partly
owing
to
the
european
immigrants
in
these
parts
having
been
uneducated
men
who
instead
of
introducing
european
civilisation
have
descended
almost
to
the
level
of
the
indians
and
adopted
some
of
their
practices
the
performances
take
place
in
the
evening
and
occupy
five
or
six
hours
bonfires
are
lighted
along
the
grassy
streets
and
the
families
of
the
better
class
are
seated
at
their
doors
enjoying
the
wild
but
fun
we
lived
at
ega
during
most
part
of
the
year
on
turtle
the
great
freshwater
turtle
of
the
amazons
grows
on
the
upper
river
to
an
immense
size
a
one
measuring
nearly
three
feet
in
length
by
two
in
breadth
and
is
a
load
for
the
strongest
indian
every
house
has
a
little
pond
called
a
curral
pen
in
the
backyard
to
hold
a
stock
of
the
animals
through
the
season
of
dearth
the
wet
months
those
who
have
a
number
of
indians
in
their
employ
send
them
out
for
a
month
when
the
waters
are
low
to
collect
a
stock
and
those
who
have
not
purchasing
their
supply
with
some
difficulty
however
as
they
are
rarely
offered
for
sale
the
price
of
turtles
like
that
of
all
other
articles
of
food
has
risen
greatly
with
the
introduction
of
when
i
arrived
in
a
one
could
be
bought
pretty
readily
for
ninepence
but
when
i
left
in
they
were
with
difficulty
obtained
at
eight
and
nine
shillings
each
the
abundance
of
turtles
or
rather
the
facility
with
which
they
can
be
found
and
caught
varies
with
the
amount
of
annual
subsidence
of
the
waters
when
the
river
sinks
less
than
the
average
they
are
scarce
but
when
more
they
can
be
caught
in
plenty
the
bays
and
shallow
lagoons
in
the
forest
having
then
only
a
small
depth
of
water
the
flesh
is
very
tender
palatable
and
wholesome
but
it
is
very
cloying
every
one
ends
sooner
or
later
by
becoming
thoroughly
surfeited
i
became
so
sick
of
turtle
in
the
course
of
two
years
that
i
could
not
bear
the
smell
of
it
although
at
the
same
time
nothing
else
was
to
be
had
and
i
was
suffering
actual
hunger
the
native
women
cook
it
in
various
ways
the
entrails
are
chopped
up
and
made
into
a
delicious
soup
called
sarapatel
which
is
generally
boiled
in
the
concave
upper
shell
of
the
animal
used
as
a
kettle
the
tender
flesh
of
the
breast
is
partially
minced
with
farinha
and
the
breast
shell
then
roasted
over
the
fire
making
a
very
pleasant
dish
steaks
cut
from
the
breast
and
cooked
with
the
fat
form
another
palatable
dish
large
sausages
are
made
of
the
coated
stomach
which
is
filled
with
minced
meat
and
boiled
the
quarters
cooked
in
a
kettle
of
tucupi
sauce
form
another
variety
of
food
when
surfeited
with
turtle
in
all
other
shapes
pieces
of
the
lean
part
roasted
on
a
spit
and
moistened
only
with
vinegar
make
an
agreeable
change
the
smaller
kind
of
turtle
the
tracaja
which
makes
its
appearance
in
the
main
river
and
lays
its
eggs
a
month
earlier
than
the
large
species
is
of
less
utility
to
the
inhabitants
although
its
flesh
is
superior
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
keeping
it
alive
it
survives
captivity
but
a
very
few
days
although
placed
in
the
same
ponds
in
which
the
large
turtle
keeps
well
for
two
or
three
years
those
who
can
not
hunt
and
fish
for
themselves
and
whose
stomachs
refuse
turtle
are
in
a
poor
way
at
ega
fish
including
many
kinds
of
large
and
delicious
salmonidae
is
abundant
in
the
fine
season
but
each
family
fishes
only
for
itself
and
has
no
surplus
for
sale
an
indian
fisherman
remains
out
just
long
enough
to
draw
what
he
thinks
sufficient
for
a
couple
of
consumption
vacca
marina
is
a
great
resource
in
the
wet
season
it
is
caught
by
harpooning
which
requires
much
skill
or
by
strong
nets
made
of
very
thick
hammock
twine
and
placed
across
narrow
inlets
very
few
europeans
are
able
to
eat
the
meat
of
this
animal
although
there
is
a
large
quantity
of
cattle
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
and
pasture
is
abundant
all
the
year
round
beef
can
be
had
only
when
a
beast
is
killed
by
accident
the
most
frequent
cause
of
death
is
poisoning
by
drinking
raw
tucupi
the
juice
of
the
mandioca
root
bowls
of
this
are
placed
on
the
ground
in
the
sheds
where
the
women
prepare
farinha
it
is
generally
done
carelessly
but
sometimes
intentionally
through
spite
when
stray
oxen
devastate
the
plantations
of
the
poorer
people
the
juice
is
almost
certain
to
be
drunk
if
cattle
stray
near
the
place
and
death
is
the
certain
result
the
owners
kill
a
beast
which
shows
symptoms
of
having
been
poisoned
and
retail
the
beef
in
the
town
although
every
one
knows
it
can
not
be
wholesome
such
is
the
scarcity
of
meat
and
the
uncontrollable
desire
to
eat
beef
that
it
is
eagerly
bought
at
least
by
those
residents
who
come
from
other
provinces
where
beef
is
the
staple
article
of
food
game
of
all
kinds
is
scarce
in
the
forest
near
the
town
except
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
when
immense
numbers
of
a
large
and
handsome
bird
cuvier
toucan
ramphastos
cuvieri
make
their
appearance
they
come
in
condition
and
are
shot
in
such
quantities
that
every
family
has
the
strange
treat
of
stewed
and
roasted
toucans
daily
for
many
weeks
curassow
birds
are
plentiful
on
the
banks
of
the
solimoens
but
to
get
a
brace
or
two
requires
the
sacrifice
of
several
days
for
the
trip
a
tapir
of
which
the
meat
is
most
delicious
and
nourishing
is
sometimes
killed
by
a
fortunate
hunter
i
have
still
a
lively
recollection
of
the
pleasant
effects
which
i
once
experienced
from
a
diet
of
fresh
tapir
meat
for
a
few
days
after
having
been
brought
to
a
painful
state
of
bodily
and
mental
depression
by
a
month
scanty
rations
of
fish
and
farinha
we
sometimes
had
fresh
bread
at
ega
made
from
american
flour
brought
from
para
but
it
was
sold
at
ninepence
a
pound
i
was
once
two
years
without
tasting
wheaten
bread
and
attribute
partly
to
this
the
gradual
deterioration
of
health
which
i
suffered
on
the
upper
amazons
mandioca
meal
is
a
poor
weak
substitute
for
bread
it
is
deficient
in
gluten
and
consequently
can
not
be
formed
into
a
leavened
mass
or
loaf
but
is
obliged
to
be
roasted
in
hard
grains
in
order
to
keep
any
length
of
time
cakes
are
made
of
the
meal
but
they
become
sour
in
a
very
few
hours
a
superior
kind
of
meal
is
manufactured
at
ega
of
the
sweet
mandioca
manihot
aypi
it
is
generally
made
with
a
mixture
of
the
starch
of
the
root
and
is
therefore
a
much
more
wholesome
article
of
food
than
the
ordinary
sort
which
on
the
amazons
is
made
of
the
pulp
after
the
starch
has
been
extracted
by
soaking
in
water
when
we
could
get
neither
bread
nor
biscuit
i
found
tapioca
soaked
in
coffee
the
best
native
substitute
we
were
seldom
without
butter
as
every
canoe
brought
one
or
two
casks
on
each
return
voyage
from
para
where
it
is
imported
in
considerable
quantity
from
liverpool
we
obtained
tea
in
the
same
way
it
being
served
as
a
fashionable
luxury
at
wedding
and
christening
parties
the
people
were
at
first
strangers
to
this
article
for
they
used
to
stew
it
in
a
saucepan
mixing
it
up
with
coarse
raw
sugar
and
stirring
it
with
a
spoon
sometimes
we
had
milk
but
this
was
only
when
a
cow
calved
the
yield
from
each
cow
was
very
small
and
lasted
only
for
a
few
weeks
in
each
case
although
the
pasture
is
good
and
the
animals
are
sleek
and
fat
fruit
of
the
ordinary
tropical
sorts
could
generally
be
had
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
variety
of
the
wild
kinds
and
of
the
delicious
flavour
of
some
of
them
many
of
these
are
utterly
unknown
in
the
regions
nearer
the
atlantic
being
the
peculiar
productions
of
this
highly
favoured
and
little
known
interior
country
some
have
been
planted
by
the
natives
in
their
clearings
the
best
was
the
or
a
scaled
fruit
probably
of
the
anonaceous
order
it
is
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
apple
when
ripe
the
rind
is
moderately
thin
and
encloses
with
the
seeds
a
quantity
of
custardy
pulp
of
a
very
rich
flavour
next
to
this
stands
the
cuma
collophora
sp
of
which
there
are
two
species
not
unlike
in
appearance
small
round
dears
but
the
rind
is
rather
hard
and
contains
a
gummy
milk
and
the
pulpy
part
is
almost
as
delicious
as
that
of
the
the
cuma
tree
is
of
moderate
height
and
grows
rather
plentifully
in
the
more
elevated
and
drier
situations
a
third
kind
is
the
pama
which
is
a
stone
fruit
similar
in
colour
and
appearance
to
the
cherry
but
of
oblong
shape
the
tree
is
one
of
the
loftiest
in
the
forest
and
has
never
i
believe
been
selected
for
cultivation
to
get
at
the
fruit
the
natives
are
obliged
to
climb
to
the
height
of
about
a
hundred
feet
and
cut
off
the
heavily
laden
branches
i
have
already
mentioned
the
umari
and
the
wishi
both
these
are
now
cultivated
the
fatty
bitter
pulp
which
surrounds
the
large
stony
seeds
of
these
fruits
is
eaten
mixed
with
farinha
and
is
very
nourishing
another
cultivated
fruit
is
the
puruma
puruma
cecropiaefolia
martius
a
round
juicy
berry
growing
in
large
bunches
and
resembling
grapes
in
taste
another
smaller
kind
called
grows
wild
in
the
forest
close
to
ega
and
has
not
yet
been
planted
the
most
singular
of
all
these
fruits
is
the
uiki
which
is
of
oblong
shape
and
grows
apparently
crosswise
on
the
end
of
its
stalk
when
ripe
the
thick
green
rind
opens
by
a
natural
cleft
across
the
middle
and
discloses
an
oval
seed
the
size
of
a
damascene
plum
but
of
a
vivid
crimson
colour
this
bright
hue
belongs
to
a
thin
coating
of
pulp
which
when
the
seeds
are
mixed
in
a
plate
of
stewed
bananas
gives
to
the
mess
a
pleasant
rosy
tint
and
a
rich
creamy
taste
and
consistence
mingua
porridge
of
bananas
flavoured
and
coloured
with
uiki
is
a
favourite
dish
at
ega
the
fruit
like
most
of
the
others
here
mentioned
ripens
in
january
many
smaller
fruits
such
as
wajuru
probably
a
species
of
achras
the
size
of
a
gooseberry
which
grows
singly
and
contains
a
sweet
gelatinous
pulp
enclosing
two
large
shining
black
seeds
an
oblong
scarlet
berry
two
kinds
of
bacuri
the
and
the
curua
sour
fruits
of
a
bright
lemon
colour
when
ripe
and
a
great
number
of
others
are
of
less
importance
as
articles
of
food
the
celebrated
peach
palm
pupunha
of
the
tupi
nations
guilielma
speciosa
is
a
common
tree
at
ega
the
name
i
suppose
is
in
allusion
to
the
colour
of
the
fruit
and
not
to
its
flavour
for
it
is
dry
and
mealy
and
in
taste
may
be
compared
to
a
mixture
of
chestnuts
and
cheese
vultures
devour
it
eagerly
and
come
in
quarrelsome
flocks
to
the
trees
when
it
is
ripe
dogs
will
also
eat
it
i
do
not
recollect
seeing
cats
do
the
same
although
they
go
voluntarily
to
the
woods
to
eat
tucuma
another
kind
of
palm
fruit
the
tree
as
it
grows
in
clusters
beside
the
huts
is
a
noble
ornament
being
when
full
grown
from
fifty
to
sixty
feet
in
height
and
often
as
straight
as
a
a
bunch
of
fruit
when
ripe
is
a
load
for
a
strong
man
and
each
tree
bears
several
of
them
the
pupunha
grows
wild
nowhere
on
the
amazons
it
is
one
of
those
few
vegetable
productions
including
three
kinds
of
mandioca
and
the
american
species
of
banana
which
the
indians
have
cultivated
from
time
immemorial
and
brought
with
them
in
their
original
migration
to
brazil
it
is
only
however
the
more
advanced
tribes
who
have
kept
up
the
cultivation
the
superiority
of
the
fruit
on
the
solimoens
to
that
grown
on
the
lower
amazons
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
para
is
very
striking
at
ega
it
is
generally
as
large
as
a
peach
and
when
boiled
almost
as
mealy
as
a
potato
while
at
para
it
is
no
bigger
than
a
walnut
and
the
pulp
is
fibrous
bunches
of
sterile
or
seedless
fruits
sometimes
occur
in
both
districts
it
is
one
of
the
principal
articles
of
food
at
ega
when
in
season
and
is
boiled
and
eaten
with
treacle
or
salt
a
dozen
of
the
seedless
fruits
makes
a
good
nourishing
meal
for
a
person
it
is
the
general
belief
that
there
is
more
nutriment
in
pupunha
than
in
fish
or
vacca
marina
the
seasons
in
the
upper
amazons
region
offer
some
points
of
difference
from
those
of
the
lower
river
and
the
district
of
para
which
two
sections
of
the
country
we
have
already
seen
also
differ
considerably
the
year
at
ega
is
divided
according
to
the
rises
and
falls
of
the
river
with
which
coincide
the
wet
and
dry
periods
all
the
principal
transactions
of
life
of
the
inhabitants
are
regulated
by
these
yearly
recurring
phenomena
the
peculiarity
of
this
upper
region
consists
in
there
being
two
rises
and
two
falls
within
the
year
the
great
annual
rise
commences
about
the
end
of
february
and
continues
to
the
middle
of
june
during
which
the
rivers
and
lakes
confined
during
the
dry
periods
to
their
ordinary
beds
gradually
swell
and
overflow
all
the
lower
lands
the
inundation
progresses
gently
inch
by
inch
and
is
felt
everywhere
even
in
the
interior
of
the
forests
of
the
higher
lands
miles
away
from
the
river
as
these
are
traversed
by
numerous
gullies
forming
in
the
fine
season
dry
spacious
dells
which
become
gradually
transformed
by
the
pressure
of
the
flood
into
broad
creeks
navigable
by
small
boats
under
the
shade
of
trees
all
the
countless
swarms
of
turtle
of
various
species
then
leave
the
main
river
for
the
inland
pools
the
go
under
water
and
the
flocks
of
wading
birds
migrate
north
to
the
upper
waters
of
the
tributaries
which
flow
from
that
direction
or
to
the
orinoco
which
streams
during
the
wet
period
of
the
amazons
are
enjoying
the
cloudless
skies
of
their
dry
season
the
families
of
fishermen
who
have
been
employed
during
the
previous
four
or
five
months
in
harpooning
and
salting
pirarucu
and
shooting
turtle
in
the
great
lakes
now
return
to
the
towns
and
villages
their
temporarily
constructed
fishing
establishments
becoming
gradually
submerged
with
the
sand
islets
or
beaches
on
which
they
were
situated
this
is
the
season
however
in
which
the
brazil
nut
and
wild
cacao
ripen
and
many
persons
go
out
to
gather
these
harvests
remaining
absent
generally
throughout
the
months
of
march
and
april
the
rains
during
this
time
are
not
continuous
they
fall
very
heavily
at
times
but
rarely
last
so
long
at
a
stretch
as
hours
and
many
days
intervene
of
pleasant
sunny
weather
the
sky
however
is
generally
overcast
and
gloomy
and
sometimes
a
drizzling
rain
falls
about
the
first
week
in
june
the
flood
is
at
its
highest
the
water
being
then
about
feet
above
its
lowest
point
but
it
varies
in
different
years
to
the
extent
of
about
fifteen
feet
the
enchente
or
flow
as
it
is
called
by
the
natives
who
believe
this
great
annual
movement
of
the
waters
to
be
of
the
same
nature
as
the
tide
towards
the
mouth
of
the
amazons
is
then
completed
and
all
begin
to
look
forward
to
the
vasante
or
ebb
the
provision
made
for
the
dearth
of
the
wet
season
is
by
this
time
pretty
nearly
exhausted
fish
is
difficult
to
procure
and
many
of
the
less
provident
inhabitants
have
become
reduced
to
a
diet
of
fruits
and
farinha
porridge
the
fine
season
begins
with
a
few
days
of
brilliant
weather
furious
hot
sun
with

seen
seated
on
the

of

and
knitting
with

are
busy
patching
up

their

large
and

in

preparations
are
made
on
all
sides
for
the
much
verao
or
summer
and
the
migration
as
it
is
called
of
fish
and
turtle
that
is
their
descent
from
the
inaccessible
pools
in
the
forest
to
the
main
river
towards
the
middle
of
july
the
begin
to
reappear
above
the
surface
of
the
waters
and
with
this
change
come
flocks
of
sandpipers
and
gulls
which
latter
make
known
the
advent
of
the
fine
season
as
the
cuckoo
does
of
the
european
spring
uttering
almost
incessantly
their
plaintive
cries
as
they
fly
about
over
the
shallow
waters
of
sandy
shores
most
of
the
birds
have
now
finished
moulting
and
begin
to
be
more
active
in
the
forest
the
fall
continues
to
the
middle
of
october
with
the
interruption
of
a
partial
rise
called
repiquet
of
a
few
inches
in
the
midst
of
very
dry
weather
in
september
caused
by
the
swollen
contribution
of
some
large
affluent
higher
up
the
river
the
amount
of
subsidence
also
varies
considerably
but
it
is
never
so
great
as
to
interrupt
navigation
by
large
vessels
the
greater
it
is
the
more
abundant
is
the
season
everyone
is
prosperous
when
the
waters
are
low
the
shallow
bays
and
pools
being
then
crowded
with
the
concentrated
population
of
fish
and
turtle
all
the
people
men
women
and
children
leave
the
villages
and
spend
the
few
weeks
of
glorious
weather
rambling
over
the
vast
undulating
expanses
of
sand
in
the
middle
of
the
solimoens
fishing
hunting
collecting
eggs
of
turtle
and
plovers
and
thoroughly
enjoying
themselves
the
inhabitants
pray
always
for
a
vasante
grande
or
great
ebb
from
the
middle
of
october
to
the
beginning
of
january
the
second
wet
season
prevails
the
rise
is
sometimes
not
more
than
about
fifteen
feet
but
it
is
in
some
years
much
more
extensive
laying
the
large
sand
islands
under
water
before
the
turtle
eggs
are
hatched
in
one
year
while
i
resided
at
ega
this
second
annual
inundation
reached
to
within
ten
feet
of
the
highest
water
point
as
marked
by
the
stains
on
the
trunks
of
trees
by
the
river
side
the
second
dry
season
comes
on
in
january
and
lasts
throughout
february
the
river
sinks
sometimes
to
the
extent
of
a
few
feet
only
but
one
year
i
saw
it
ebb
to
within
about
five
feet
of
its
lowest
point
in
september
this
is
called
the
summer
of
the
umari
verao
do
umari
after
the
fruit
of
this
name
already
described
which
ripens
at
this
season
when
the
fall
is
great
this
is
the
best
time
to
catch
turtles
in
the
year
above
mentioned
nearly
all
the
residents
who
had
a
canoe
and
could
work
a
paddle
went
out
after
them
in
the
month
of
february
and
about
were
caught
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
it
appears
that
they
had
been
arrested
in
their
migration
towards
the
interior
pools
of
the
forest
by
the
sudden
drying
up
of
the
and
so
had
become
easy
prey
thus
the
ega
year
is
divided
into
four
seasons
two
of
dry
weather
and
falling
waters
and
two
of
the
reverse
besides
this
variety
there
is
in
the
month
of
may
a
short
season
of
very
cold
weather
a
most
surprising
circumstance
in
this
otherwise
uniformly
sweltering
climate
this
is
caused
by
the
continuance
of
a
cold
wind
which
blows
from
the
south
over
the
humid
forests
that
extend
without
interruption
from
north
of
the
equator
to
the
eighteenth
parallel
of
latitude
in
bolivia
i
had
unfortunately
no
thermometer
with
me
at
ega
the
only
one
i
brought
with
me
from
england
having
been
lost
at
para
the
temperature
is
so
much
lowered
that
fishes
die
in
the
river
teffe
and
are
cast
in
considerable
quantities
on
its
shores
the
wind
is
not
strong
but
it
brings
cloudy
weather
and
lasts
from
three
to
five
or
six
days
in
each
year
the
inhabitants
all
suffer
much
from
the
cold
many
of
them
wrapping
themselves
up
with
the
warmest
clothing
they
can
get
blankets
are
here
unknown
and
shutting
themselves
indoors
with
a
charcoal
fire
lighted
i
found
myself
the
change
of
temperature
most
delightful
and
did
not
require
extra
clothing
it
was
a
bad
time
however
for
my
pursuit
as
birds
and
insects
all
betook
themselves
to
places
of
concealment
and
remained
inactive
the
period
during
which
this
wind
prevails
is
called
the
tempo
da
friagem
or
the
season
of
coldness
the
phenomenon
i
presume
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
in
may
it
is
winter
in
the
southern
temperate
zone
and
that
the
cool
currents
of
air
travelling
thence
northwards
towards
the
equator
become
only
moderately
heated
in
their
course
owing
to
the
intermediate
country
being
a
vast
plain
covered
with
humid
forests

i
will
now
proceed
to
give
some
account
of
the
more
interesting
of
my
shorter
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ega
the
incidents
of
the
longer
voyages
which
occupied
each
several
months
will
be
narrated
in
a
separate
chapter
the
settlement
as
before
described
is
built
on
a
small
tract
of
cleared
land
at
the
lower
or
eastern
end
of
the
lake
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
main
amazons
with
which
the
lake
communicates
by
a
narrow
channel
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
broad
expanse
stands
a
small
village
called
nogueira
the
houses
of
which
are
not
visible
from
ega
except
on
very
clear
days
the
coast
on
the
nogueira
side
is
high
and
stretches
away
into
the
grey
distance
towards
the
southwest
the
upper
part
of
the
river
teffe
is
not
visited
by
the
ega
people
on
account
of
its
extreme
unhealthiness
and
its
barrenness
in
sarsaparilla
and
other
wares
to
europeans
it
would
seem
a
most
surprising
thing
that
the
people
of
a
civilised
settlement
a
hundred
and
seventy
years
old
should
still
be
ignorant
of
the
course
of
the
river
on
whose
banks
their
native
place
for
which
they
proudly
claim
the
title
of
city
is
situated
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
a
private
individual
to
explore
it
as
the
necessary
number
of
indian
paddlers
could
not
be
obtained
i
knew
only
one
person
who
had
ascended
the
teffe
to
any
considerable
distance
and
he
was
not
able
to
give
me
a
distinct
account
of
the
river
the
only
tribe
known
to
live
on
its
banks
are
the
catauishis
a
people
who
perforate
their
lips
all
round
and
wear
rows
of
slender
sticks
in
the
holes
their
territory
lies
between
the
purus
and
the
jurua
embracing
both
shores
of
the
teffe
a
large
navigable
stream
the
bararua
enters
the
lake
from
the
west
about
thirty
miles
above
ega
the
breadth
of
the
lake
is
much
contracted
a
little
below
the
mouth
of
this
tributary
but
it
again
expands
further
south
and
terminates
abruptly
where
the
teffe
proper
a
narrow
river
with
a
strong
current
forms
its
head
water
the
whole
of
the
country
for
hundreds
of
miles
is
covered
with
picturesque
but
pathless
forests
and
there
are
only
two
roads
along
which
excursions
can
be
made
by
land
from
ega
one
is
a
narrow
hunter
track
about
two
miles
in
length
which
traverses
the
forest
in
the
rear
of
the
settlement
the
other
is
an
extremely
pleasant
path
along
the
beach
to
the
west
of
the
town
this
is
practicable
only
in
the
dry
season
when
a
flat
strip
of
white
sandy
beach
is
exposed
at
the
foot
of
the
high
wooded
banks
of
the
lake
covered
with
trees
which
as
there
is
no
underwood
form
a
spacious
shady
grove
i
rambled
daily
during
many
weeks
of
each
successive
dry
season
along
this
delightful
road
the
trees
many
of
which
are
myrtles
and
wild
guavas
with
smooth
yellow
stems
were
in
flower
at
this
time
and
the
rippling
waters
of
the
lake
under
the
cool
shade
everywhere
bordered
the
path
the
place
was
the
resort
of
kingfishers
green
and
blue
tanagers
and
hummingbirds
birds
generally
however
were
not
numerous
every
tree
was
tenanted
by
cicadas
the
reedy
notes
of
which
produced
that
loud
jarring
insect
music
which
is
the
general
accompaniment
of
a
woodland
ramble
in
a
hot
climate
one
species
was
very
handsome
having
wings
adorned
with
patches
of
bright
green
and
scarlet
it
was
very
common
sometimes
three
or
four
tenanting
a
single
tree
clinging
as
usual
to
the
branches
on
approaching
a
tree
thus
peopled
a
number
of
little
jets
of
a
clear
liquid
would
be
seen
squirted
from
aloft
i
have
often
received
the
discharge
full
on
my
face
but
the
liquid
is
harmless
having
a
sweetish
taste
and
is
ejected
by
the
insect
from
the
anus
probably
in
or
from
fear
the
number
and
variety
of
butterflies
sporting
about
in
this
grove
on
sunny
days
were
so
great
that
the
bright
moving
flakes
of
colour
gave
quite
a
character
to
the
physiognomy
of
the
place
it
was
impossible
to
walk
far
without
disturbing
flocks
of
them
from
the
damp
sand
at
the
edge
of
the
water
where
they
congregated
to
imbibe
the
moisture
they
were
of
almost
all
colours
sizes
and
shapes
i
noticed
here
altogether
eighty
species
belonging
to
different
genera
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
with
very
few
exceptions
all
the
individuals
of
these
various
species
thus
sporting
in
sunny
places
were
of
the
male
sex
their
partners
which
are
much
more
soberly
dressed
and
immensely
less
numerous
than
the
males
being
confined
to
the
shades
of
the
woods
every
afternoon
as
the
sun
was
getting
low
i
used
to
notice
these
gaudy
swains
trooping
off
to
the
forest
where
i
suppose
they
would
find
their
sweethearts
and
wives
the
most
abundant
next
to
the
very
common
and
kinds
were
about
a
dozen
species
of
eunica
which
are
of
large
size
and
are
conspicuous
from
their
liveries
of
glossy
and
purple
a
creature
the
callithea
markii
having
wings
of
a
thick
texture
coloured
and
orange
was
only
an
occasional
visitor
on
certain
days
when
the
weather
was
very
calm
two
small
green
species
symmachia
trochilus
and
colubris
literally
swarmed
on
the
sands
their
glittering
wings
lying
wide
open
on
the
flat
surface
the
beach
terminates
eight
miles
beyond
ega
at
the
mouth
of
a
rivulet
the
character
of
the
coast
then
changes
the
river
banks
being
masked
by
a
line
of
low
islets
amid
a
labyrinth
of
channels
in
all
other
directions
my
very
numerous
excursions
were
by
water
the
most
interesting
of
those
made
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
were
to
the
houses
of
indians
on
the
banks
of
retired
creeks
an
account
of
one
of
these
trips
will
suffice
on
the
of
may
i
visited
in
company
with
antonio
cardozo
the
delegado
a
family
of
the
passe
tribe
who
live
near
the
head
waters
of
the
igarape
which
flows
from
the
south
into
the
teffe
entering
it
at
ega
the
creek
is
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
broad
near
the
town
but
a
few
miles
inland
it
gradually
contracts
until
it
becomes
a
mere
rivulet
flowing
through
a
broad
dell
in
the
forest
when
the
river
rises
it
fills
this
dell
the
trunks
of
the
lofty
trees
then
stand
many
feet
deep
in
the
water
and
small
canoes
are
able
to
travel
the
distance
of
a
day
journey
under
the
shade
regular
paths
or
alleys
being
cut
through
the
branches
and
lower
trees
this
is
the
general
character
of
the
country
of
the
upper
amazons
a
land
of
small
elevation
and
abruptly
undulated
the
hollows
forming
narrow
valleys
in
the
dry
months
and
deep
navigable
creeks
in
the
wet
months
in
retired
nooks
on
the
margins
of
these
shady
rivulets
a
few
families
or
small
hordes
of
aborigines
still
linger
in
nearly
their
primitive
state
the
relicts
of
their
once
numerous
tribes
the
family
we
intended
to
visit
on
this
trip
was
that
of
peter
the
great
or
tall
peter
an
old
chieftain
or
tushaua
of
the
passes
we
set
out
at
sunrise
in
a
small
igarite
manned
by
six
young
indian
paddlers
after
travelling
about
three
miles
along
the
broad
portion
of
the
creek
which
being
surrounded
by
woods
had
the
appearance
of
a
large
pool
we
came
to
a
part
where
our
course
seemed
to
be
stopped
by
an
impenetrable
hedge
of
trees
and
bushes
we
were
some
time
before
finding
the
entrance
but
when
fairly
within
the
shades
a
remarkable
scene
presented
itself
it
was
my
first
introduction
to
these
singular
waterpaths
a
narrow
and
tolerably
straight
alley
stretched
away
for
a
long
distance
before
us
on
each
side
were
the
tops
of
bushes
and
young
trees
forming
a
kind
of
border
to
the
path
and
the
trunks
of
the
tall
forest
trees
rose
at
irregular
intervals
from
the
water
their
crowns
interlocking
far
over
our
heads
and
forming
a
thick
shade
slender
air
roots
hung
down
in
clusters
and
looping
sipos
dangled
from
the
lower
branches
bunches
of
grass
tillandsiae
and
ferns
sat
in
the
forks
of
the
larger
boughs
and
the
trunks
of
trees
near
the
water
had
adhering
to
them
round
dried
masses
of
freshwater
sponges
there
was
no
current
perceptible
and
the
water
was
stained
of
a
dark
hue
but
the
submerged
stems
could
be
seen
through
it
to
a
great
depth
we
travelled
at
good
speed
for
three
hours
along
this
shady
road
the
distance
of
pedro
house
from
ega
being
about
twenty
miles
when
the
paddlers
rested
for
a
time
the
stillness
and
gloom
of
the
place
became
almost
painful
our
voices
waked
dull
echoes
as
we
conversed
and
the
noise
made
by
fishes
occasionally
whipping
the
surface
of
the
water
was
quite
startling
a
cool
moist
clammy
air
pervaded
the
sunless
shade
the
breadth
of
the
wooded
valley
at
the
commencement
is
probably
more
than
half
a
mile
and
there
is
a
tolerably
clear
view
for
a
considerable
distance
on
each
side
of
the
through
the
irregular
colonnade
of
trees
other
paths
also
in
this
part
branch
off
right
and
left
from
the
principal
road
leading
to
the
scattered
houses
of
indians
on
the
mainland
the
dell
contracts
gradually
towards
the
head
of
the
rivulet
and
the
forest
then
becomes
denser
the
waterpath
also
diminishes
in
width
and
becomes
more
winding
on
account
of
the
closer
growth
of
the
trees
the
boughs
of
some
are
stretched
forth
at
no
great
height
over
one
head
and
are
seen
to
be
loaded
with
epiphytes
one
orchid
i
noticed
particularly
on
account
of
its
bright
yellow
flowers
growing
at
the
end
of
several
feet
long
some
of
the
trunks
especially
those
of
palms
close
beneath
their
crowns
were
clothed
with
a
thick
mass
of
glossy
pothos
plants
mingled
with
ferns
arrived
at
this
part
we
were
in
fact
in
the
heart
of
the
virgin
forest
we
heard
no
noises
of
animals
in
the
trees
and
saw
only
one
bird
the
chatterer
sitting
alone
on
a
high
branch
for
some
distance
the
lower
vegetation
was
so
dense
that
the
road
runs
under
an
arcade
of
foliage
the
branches
having
been
cut
away
only
sufficiently
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
a
small
canoe
these
thickets
are
formed
chiefly
of
bamboos
whose
slender
foliage
and
curving
stems
arrange
themselves
in
elegant
feathery
bowers
but
other
social
plants
slender
green
climbers
with
tendrils
so
eager
in
aspiring
to
grasp
the
higher
boughs
that
they
seem
to
be
endowed
almost
with
animal
energy
and
certain
low
trees
having
large
leaves
contribute
also
to
the
jungly
masses
occasionally
we
came
upon
an
uprooted
tree
lying
across
the
path
its
voluminous
crown
still
held
up
by
thick
cables
of
sipo
connecting
it
with
standing
trees
a
wide
circuit
had
to
be
made
in
these
cases
and
it
was
sometimes
difficult
to
find
the
right
path
again
at
length
we
arrived
at
our
journey
end
we
were
then
in
a
very
dense
and
gloomy
part
of
the
forest
we
could
see
however
the
dry
land
on
both
sides
of
the
creek
and
to
our
right
a
small
sunny
opening
appeared
the
landing
place
to
the
native
dwellings
the
water
was
deep
close
to
the
bank
and
a
clean
pathway
ascended
from
the
shady
port
to
the
buildings
which
were
about
a
furlong
distant
my
friend
cardozo
was
godfather
to
a
grandchild
of
whose
daughter
had
married
an
indian
settled
in
ega
he
had
sent
word
to
the
old
man
that
he
intended
to
visit
him
we
were
therefore
expected
as
we
landed
himself
came
down
to
the
port
to
receive
us
our
arrival
having
been
announced
by
the
barking
of
dogs
he
was
a
tall
and
thin
old
man
with
a
serious
but
benignant
expression
of
countenance
and
a
manner
much
freer
from
shyness
and
distrust
than
is
usual
with
indians
he
was
clad
in
a
shirt
of
coarse
cotton
cloth
dyed
with
murishi
and
trousers
of
the
same
material
turned
up
to
the
knee
his
features
were
sharply
delineated
more
so
than
in
any
indian
face
i
had
yet
seen
the
lips
thin
and
the
nose
rather
high
and
compressed
a
large
square
tattooed
patch
occupied
the
middle
of
his
face
which
as
well
as
the
other
exposed
parts
of
his
body
was
of
a
light
colour
instead
of
the
usual
brown
hue
he
walked
with
an
upright
slow
gait
and
on
reaching
us
saluted
cardozo
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
he
was
dealing
with
an
equal
my
friend
introduced
me
and
i
was
welcomed
in
the
same
grave
ceremonious
manner
he
seemed
to
have
many
questions
to
ask
but
they
were
chiefly
about
senora
felippa
cardozo
indian
housekeeper
at
ega
and
were
purely
complimentary
this
studied
politeness
is
quite
natural
to
indians
of
the
advanced
agricultural
tribes
the
language
used
was
tupi
i
heard
no
other
spoken
all
the
day
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
had
never
had
much
intercourse
with
whites
he
was
although
baptised
a
primitive
indian
who
had
always
lived
in
retirement
the
ceremony
of
baptism
having
been
gone
through
as
it
generally
is
by
the
aborigines
simply
from
a
wish
to
stand
well
with
the
whites
arrived
at
the
house
we
were
welcomed
by
pedro
wife
a
thin
wrinkled
active
old
squaw
tattooed
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
her
husband
she
also
had
sharp
features
but
her
manner
was
more
cordial
and
quicker
than
that
of
her
husband
she
talked
much
and
with
great
inflection
of
voice
while
the
tones
of
the
old
man
were
rather
drawling
and
querulous
her
clothing
was
a
long
petticoat
of
thick
cotton
cloth
and
a
very
short
chemise
not
reaching
to
her
waist
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
the
grounds
around
the
establishment
in
neater
order
than
in
any
sitio
even
of
civilised
people
i
had
yet
seen
on
the
upper
amazons
the
stock
of
utensils
and
household
goods
of
all
sorts
was
larger
and
the
evidences
of
regular
industry
and
plenty
more
numerous
than
one
usually
perceives
in
the
farms
of
civilised
indians
and
whites
the
buildings
were
of
the
same
construction
as
those
of
the
humbler
settlers
in
all
other
parts
of
the
country
the
family
lived
in
a
large
oblong
open
shed
built
under
the
shade
of
trees
two
smaller
buildings
detached
from
the
shed
and
having
with
low
doorways
contained
apparently
the
sleeping
apartments
of
different
members
of
the
large
household
a
small
mill
for
grinding
having
two
cylinders
of
hard
notched
wood
wooden
troughs
and
kettles
for
boiling
the
guarapa
cane
juice
to
make
treacle
stood
under
a
separate
shed
and
near
it
was
a
large
enclosed
for
poultry
there
was
another
hut
and
shed
a
short
distance
off
inhabited
by
a
family
dependent
on
pedro
and
a
narrow
pathway
through
the
luxuriant
woods
led
to
more
dwellings
of
the
same
kind
there
was
an
abundance
of
fruit
trees
around
the
place
including
the
banana
with
its
long
broad
soft
green
blades
and
groups
of
pupunhas
or
peach
palms
there
was
also
a
large
number
of
cotton
and
coffee
trees
among
the
utensils
i
noticed
baskets
of
different
shapes
made
of
flattened
maranta
stalks
and
dyed
various
colours
the
making
of
these
is
an
original
art
of
the
passes
but
i
believe
it
is
also
practised
by
other
tribes
for
i
saw
several
in
the
houses
of
civilised
indians
on
the
tapajos
there
were
only
three
persons
in
the
house
besides
the
old
couple
the
rest
of
the
people
being
absent
several
came
in
however
in
the
course
of
the
day
one
was
a
daughter
of
pedro
who
had
an
oval
tattooed
spot
over
her
mouth
the
second
was
a
young
grandson
and
the
third
the
from
ega
compadre
the
old
woman
was
occupied
when
we
entered
in
distilling
spirits
from
cara
an
edible
root
similar
to
the
potato
by
means
of
a
clay
still
which
had
been
manufactured
by
herself
the
liquor
had
a
reddish
tint
but
not
a
very
agreeable
flavour
a
cup
of
it
warm
from
the
still
however
was
welcome
after
our
long
journey
cardozo
liked
it
emptied
his
cup
and
replenished
it
in
a
very
short
time
the
old
lady
was
very
talkative
and
almost
fussy
in
her
desire
to
please
her
visitors
we
sat
in
tucum
hammocks
suspended
between
the
upright
posts
of
the
shed
the
young
woman
with
the
blue
mouth
who
although
married
was
as
shy
as
any
young
maiden
of
her
race
soon
became
employed
in
scalding
and
plucking
fowls
for
the
dinner
near
the
fire
on
the
ground
at
the
other
end
of
the
dwelling
the
law
and
cardozo
now
began
a
long
conversation
on
the
subject
of
their
deceased
wife
daughter
and
comadre
mother
the
term
expressing
the
relationship
of
a
mother
to
the
godfather
of
her
child
it
appeared
she
had
died
of
tisica
as
they
called
it
a
word
adopted
by
the
indians
from
the
portuguese
the
widower
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
nearly
the
same
words
his
account
of
her
illness
pedro
chiming
in
like
a
chorus
and
cardozo
moralising
and
condoling
i
thought
the
cauim
grog
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
flow
of
talk
and
warmth
of
feeling
of
all
three
the
widower
drank
and
wailed
until
he
became
maundering
and
finally
fell
left
them
talking
and
took
a
long
ramble
into
the
forest
pedro
sending
his
grandson
a
smiling
lad
of
about
fourteen
years
of
age
to
show
me
the
paths
my
companion
taking
with
him
his
zarabatana
or
this
instrument
is
used
by
all
the
indian
tribes
on
the
upper
amazons
it
is
generally
nine
or
ten
feet
long
and
is
made
of
two
separate
lengths
of
wood
each
scooped
out
so
as
to
form
of
the
tube
to
do
this
with
the
necessary
accuracy
requires
an
enormous
amount
of
patient
labour
and
considerable
mechanical
ability
the
tools
used
being
simply
the
incisor
teeth
of
the
paca
and
cutia
the
two
half
tubes
when
finished
are
secured
together
by
a
very
close
and
tight
strapping
consisting
of
long
flat
strips
of
jacitara
or
the
wood
of
the
climbing
and
the
whole
is
smeared
afterwards
with
black
wax
the
production
of
a
melipona
bee
the
pipe
tapers
towards
the
muzzle
and
a
mouthpiece
made
of
wood
is
fitted
in
the
broad
end
a
sized
zarabatana
is
heavy
and
can
only
be
used
by
an
adult
indian
who
has
had
great
practice
the
young
lads
learn
to
shoot
with
smaller
and
lighter
tubes
when
wallace
and
i
had
lessons
at
barra
in
the
use
of
the
of
julio
a
juri
indian
then
in
the
employ
of
hauxwell
an
english
collector
we
found
it
very
difficult
to
hold
steadily
the
long
tubes
the
arrows
are
made
from
the
hard
rind
of
the
of
certain
palms
thin
strips
being
cut
and
rendered
as
sharp
as
needles
by
scraping
the
ends
with
a
knife
or
the
tooth
of
an
animal
they
are
winged
with
a
little
oval
mass
of
samauma
silk
from
the
of
the
tree
eriodendron
samauma
cotton
being
too
heavy
the
ball
of
samauma
should
fit
to
a
nicety
the
bore
of
the
blowgun
when
it
does
so
the
arrow
can
be
propelled
with
such
force
by
the
breath
that
it
makes
a
noise
almost
as
loud
as
a
on
flying
from
the
muzzle
my
little
companion
was
armed
with
a
quiver
full
of
these
little
missiles
a
small
number
of
which
sufficient
for
the
sport
were
tipped
with
the
fatal
urari
poison
the
quiver
was
an
ornamental
affair
the
broad
rim
being
made
of
wood
of
a
rich
colour
the
or
redwood
of
the
japura
the
body
was
formed
of
strips
of
maranta
stalks
and
the
belt
by
which
it
was
suspended
from
the
shoulder
was
decorated
with
cotton
fringes
and
tassels
we
walked
about
two
miles
along
a
pathway
through
high
caapoeira
forest
a
large
proportion
of
the
trees
were
melastomas
which
bore
a
hairy
yellow
fruit
nearly
as
large
and
as
well
flavoured
as
our
gooseberry
the
season
however
was
nearly
over
for
them
the
road
was
bordered
every
inch
of
the
way
by
a
thick
bed
of
elegant
lycopodiums
an
artificial
arrangement
of
trees
and
bushes
could
scarcely
have
been
made
to
wear
so
finished
an
appearance
as
this
naturally
decorated
avenue
the
path
at
length
terminated
at
a
plantation
of
mandioca
the
largest
i
had
yet
seen
since
i
left
the
neighbourhood
of
para
there
were
probably
ten
acres
of
cleared
land
and
part
of
the
ground
was
planted
with
indian
corn
melons
and
sugar
cane
beyond
this
field
there
was
only
a
faint
hunter
track
leading
towards
the
untrodden
interior
my
companion
told
me
he
had
never
heard
of
there
being
any
inhabitants
in
that
direction
the
south
we
crossed
the
forest
from
this
place
to
another
smaller
clearing
and
then
walked
on
our
road
home
through
about
two
miles
of
caapoeira
of
various
ages
the
sites
of
old
plantations
the
only
fruits
of
our
ramble
were
a
few
rare
insects
and
a
japu
cassicus
cristatus
a
handsome
bird
with
chestnut
and
plumage
which
wanders
through
the
in
large
flocks
my
little
companion
brought
this
down
from
a
height
which
i
calculated
at
thirty
yards
the
however
in
the
hands
of
an
expert
adult
indian
can
be
made
to
propel
arrows
so
as
to
kill
at
a
distance
of
fifty
and
sixty
yards
the
aim
is
most
certain
when
the
tube
is
held
vertically
or
nearly
so
it
is
a
far
more
useful
weapon
in
the
forest
than
a
gun
for
the
report
of
a
firearm
alarms
the
whole
flock
of
birds
or
monkeys
feeding
on
a
tree
while
the
silent
poisoned
dart
brings
the
animals
down
one
by
one
until
the
sportsman
has
a
heap
of
slain
by
his
side
none
but
the
stealthy
indian
can
use
it
effectively
the
poison
which
must
be
fresh
to
kill
speedily
is
obtained
only
of
the
indians
who
live
beyond
the
cataracts
of
the
rivers
flowing
from
the
north
especially
the
rio
negro
and
the
japura
its
principal
ingredient
is
the
wood
of
the
strychnos
toxifera
a
tree
which
does
not
grow
in
the
humid
forests
of
the
river
plains
a
most
graphic
account
of
the
urari
and
of
an
expedition
undertaken
in
search
of
the
tree
in
guiana
has
been
given
by
sir
robert
schomburgk
annals
and
magazine
of

history
vol
vii
p
when
we
returned
to
the
house
after
cardozo
was
still
sipping
cauim
and
now
looked
exceedingly
merry
it
was
fearfully
hot
the
good
fellow
sat
in
his
hammock
with
a
cuya
full
of
grog
in
his
hands
his
broad
honest
face
all
of
a
glow
and
the
perspiration
streaming
down
his
uncovered
breast
the
unbuttoned
shirt
having
slipped
over
his
broad
shoulders
uassu
had
not
drunk
much
he
was
noted
as
i
afterwards
learned
for
his
temperance
but
he
was
standing
up
as
i
had
left
him
two
hours
previous
talking
to
cardozo
in
the
same
monotonous
tones
the
conversation
apparently
not
having
flagged
all
the
time
i
had
never
heard
so
much
talking
amongst
indians
the
widower
was
asleep
the
stirring
managing
old
lady
with
her
daughter
were
preparing
dinner
this
which
was
ready
soon
after
i
entered
consisted
of
boiled
fowls
and
rice
seasoned
with
large
green
peppers
and
lemon
juice
and
piles
of
new
fragrant
farinha
and
raw
bananas
it
was
served
on
plates
of
english
manufacture
on
a
tupe
or
large
plaited
rush
mat
such
as
is
made
by
the
natives
pretty
generally
on
the
amazons
three
or
four
other
indians
men
and
women
of
middle
age
now
made
their
appearance
and
joined
in
the
meal
we
all
sat
round
on
the
floor
the
women
according
to
custom
not
eating
until
after
the
men
had
done
before
sitting
down
our
host
apologised
in
his
usual
quiet
courteous
manner
for
not
having
knives
and
forks
cardozo
and
i
ate
by
the
aid
of
wooden
spoons
the
indians
using
their
fingers
the
old
man
waited
until
we
were
all
served
before
he
himself
commenced
at
the
end
of
the
meal
one
of
the
women
brought
us
water
in
a
painted
clay
basin
of
indian
manufacture
and
a
clean
coarse
cotton
napkin
that
we
might
wash
our
hands
the
horde
of
passes
of
which
was
tushaua
or
chieftain
was
at
this
time
reduced
to
a
very
small
number
of
individuals
the
disease
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
had
for
several
generations
made
great
havoc
among
them
many
had
also
entered
the
service
of
whites
at
ega
and
of
late
years
intermarriages
with
whites
and
civilised
indians
had
been
frequent
the
old
man
bewailed
the
fate
of
his
race
to
cardozo
with
tears
in
his
eyes
the
people
of
my
nation
he
said
have
always
been
good
friends
to
the
cariwas
whites
but
before
my
grandchildren
are
old
like
me
the
name
of
passe
will
be
forgotten
in
so
far
as
the
passes
have
amalgamated
with
european
immigrants
or
their
descendants
and
become
civilised
brazilian
citizens
there
can
scarcely
be
ground
for
lamenting
their
extinction
as
a
nation
but
it
fills
one
with
regret
to
learn
how
many
die
prematurely
of
a
disease
which
seems
to
arise
on
their
simply
breathing
the
same
air
as
the
whites
the
original
territory
of
the
tribe
must
have
been
of
large
extent
for
passes
are
said
to
have
been
found
by
the
early
portuguese
colonists
on
the
rio
negro
an
ancient
settlement
on
that
river
barcellos
having
been
peopled
by
them
when
it
was
first
established
and
they
formed
also
part
of
the
original
population
of
on
the
solimoens
their
hordes
were
therefore
spread
over
a
region
miles
in
length
from
cast
to
west
it
is
probable
however
that
they
have
been
confounded
by
the
colonists
with
other
neighbouring
tribes
who
tattoo
their
faces
in
a
similar
manner
the
extinct
tribe
of
yurimauas
or
sorimoas
from
which
the
river
solimoens
derives
its
name
according
to
traditions
extant
at
ega
resembled
the
passes
in
their
slender
figures
and
friendly
disposition
these
tribes
with
others
lying
between
them
peopled
the
banks
of
the
main
river
and
its
streams
from
the
mouth
of
the

banks
of
the
issa
miles
to
the
west
of
ega
within
the
memory
of
living
persons
the
only
large
body
of
them
now
extant
are
located
on
the
japura
at
a
place
distant
about
miles
from
ega
the
population
of
this
horde
however
does
not
exceed
from
what
i
could
learn
or
persons
i
think
it
probable
that
the
lower
part
of
the
japura
and
its
extensive
delta
lands
formed
the
original
home
of
this
gentle
tribe
of
indians
the
passes
are
always
spoken
of
in
this
country
as
the
most
advanced
of
all
the
indian
nations
in
the
amazons
region
under
what
influences
this
tribe
has
become
so
strongly
modified
in
mental
social
and
bodily
features
it
is
hard
to
divine
the
industrious
habits
fidelity
and
mildness
of
disposition
of
the
passes
their
docility
and
it
may
be
added
their
personal
beauty
especially
of
the
children
and
women
made
them
from
the
first
very
attractive
to
the
portuguese
colonists
they
were
consequently
enticed
in
great
number
from
their
villages
and
brought
to
barra
and
other
settlements
of
the
whites
the
wives
of
governors
and
military
officers
from
europe
were
always
eager
to
obtain
children
for
domestic
servants
the
girls
being
taught
to
sew
cook
weave
hammocks
manufacture
and
so
forth
they
have
been
generally
treated
with
kindness
especially
by
the
educated
families
in
the
settlements
it
is
pleasant
to
have
to
record
that
i
never
heard
of
a
deed
of
violence
perpetrated
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
in
the
dealings
between
european
settlers
and
this
noble
tribe
of
savages
very
little
is
known
of
the
original
customs
of
the
passes
the
mode
of
life
of
our
host
did
not
differ
much
from
that
of
the
civilised
mamelucos
but
he
and
his
people
showed
a
greater
industry
and
were
more
open
cheerful
and
generous
in
their
dealings
than
many
the
authority
of
pedro
like
that
of
the
tushauas
generally
was
exercised
in
a
mild
manner
these
chieftains
appear
able
to
command
the
services
of
their
subjects
since
they
furnish
men
to
the
brazilian
authorities
when
requested
but
none
of
them
even
those
of
the
most
advanced
tribes
appear
to
make
use
of
this
authority
for
the
accumulation
of
property
the
service
being
exacted
chiefly
in
time
of
war
had
the
ambition
of
the
chiefs
of
some
of
these
industrious
tribes
been
turned
to
the
acquisition
of
wealth
probably
we
should
have
seen
indigenous
civilised
nations
in
the
heart
of
south
america
similar
to
those
found
on
the
andes
of
peru
and
mexico
it
is
very
probable
that
the
passes
adopted
from
the
first
to
some
extent
the
manners
of
the
whites
ribeiro
a
portuguese
official
who
travelled
in
these
regions
in
and
wrote
an
account
of
his
journey
relates
that
they
buried
their
dead
in
large
earthenware
vessels
a
custom
still
observed
among
other
tribes
on
the
upper
amazons
and
that
as
to
their
marriages
the
young
men
earned
their
brides
by
valiant
deeds
in
war
he
also
states
that
they
possessed
a
cosmogony
in
which
the
belief
that
the
sun
was
a
fixed
body
with
the
earth
revolving
around
it
was
a
prominent
feature
he
says
moreover
that
they
believed
in
a
creator
of
all
things
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
and
so
forth
these
notions
are
so
far
in
advance
of
the
ideas
of
all
other
tribes
of
indians
and
so
little
likely
to
have
been
conceived
and
perfected
by
a
people
having
no
written
language
or
leisured
class
that
we
must
suppose
them
to
have
been
derived
by
the
docile
passes
from
some
early
missionary
or
traveller
i
never
found
that
the
passes
had
more
curiosity
or
activity
of
intellect
than
other
indians
no
trace
of
a
belief
in
a
future
state
exists
amongst
indians
who
have
not
had
much
intercourse
with
the
civilised
settlers
and
even
amongst
those
who
have
it
is
only
a
few
of
the
more
gifted
individuals
who
show
any
curiosity
on
the
subject
their
sluggish
minds
seem
unable
to
conceive
or
feel
the
want
of
a
theory
of
the
soul
and
of
the
relations
of
man
to
the
rest
of
nature
or
to
the
creator
but
is
it
not
so
with
totally
uneducated
and
isolated
people
even
in
the
most
highly
civilised
parts
of
the
world
the
good
qualities
of
the
passes
belong
to
the
moral
part
of
the
character
they
lead
a
contented
unambitious
and
friendly
life
a
quiet
domestic
orderly
existence
varied
by
occasional
drinking
bouts
and
summer
excursions
they
are
not
so
shrewd
energetic
and
masterful
as
the
mundurucus
but
they
are
more
easily
taught
because
their
disposition
is
more
yielding
than
that
of
the
mundurucus
or
any
other
tribe
we
started
on
our
return
to
ega
at
four
in
the
afternoon
our
generous
entertainers
loaded
us
with
presents
there
was
scarcely
room
for
us
to
sit
in
the
canoe
as
they
had
sent
down
ten
large
bundles
of
four
baskets
of
farinha
three
cedar
planks
a
small
hamper
of
coffee
and
two
heavy
bunches
of
bananas
after
we
were
embarked
the
old
lady
came
with
a
parting
gift
for
me
a
huge
bowl
of
smoking
hot
banana
porridge
i
was
to
eat
it
on
the
road
to
keep
my
stomach
warm
both
stood
on
the
bank
as
we
pushed
off
and
gave
us
their
adios
ikudna
tupana
eirum
go
with
god
a
form
of
salutation
taught
by
the
old
jesuit
missionaries
we
had
a
most
uncomfortable
passage
for
cardozo
was
quite
tipsy
and
had
not
attended
to
the
loading
of
the
boat
the
cargo
had
been
placed
too
far
forward
and
to
make
matters
worse
my
heavy
friend
obstinately
insisted
on
sitting
astride
on
the
top
of
the
pile
instead
of
taking
his
place
near
the
stern
singing
from
his
perch
a
most
indecent
and
disregarding
the
inconvenience
of
having
to
bend
down
almost
every
minute
to
pass
under
the
boughs
of
hanging
sipos
as
we
sped
rapidly
along
the
canoe
leaked
but
not
at
first
alarmingly
long
before
sunset
darkness
began
to
close
in
under
those
gloomy
shades
and
our
steersman
could
not
avoid
now
and
then
running
the
boat
into
the
thicket
the
first
time
this
happened
a
piece
was
broken
off
the
square
prow
rodella
the
second
time
we
got
squeezed
between
two
trees
a
short
time
after
this
latter
accident
being
seated
near
the
stern
with
my
feet
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
i
felt
rather
suddenly
the
cold
water
above
my
ankles
a
few
minutes
more
and
we
should
have
sunk
for
a
seam
had
been
opened
forward
under
the
pile
of
two
of
us
began
to
bale
and
by
the
most
strenuous
efforts
managed
to
keep
afloat
without
throwing
overboard
our
cargo
the
indians
were
obliged
to
paddle
with
extreme
slowness
to
avoid
shipping
water
as
the
edge
of
our
prow
was
nearly
level
with
the
surface
but
cardozo
was
now
persuaded
to
change
his
seat
the
sun
set
the
quick
twilight
passed
and
the
moon
soon
after
began
to
glimmer
through
the
thick
canopy
of
foliage
the
prospect
of
being
swamped
in
this
hideous
solitude
was
by
no
means
pleasant
although
i
calculated
on
the
chance
of
swimming
to
a
tree
and
finding
a
nice
snug
place
in
the
fork
of
some
large
bough
wherein
to
pass
the
night
at
length
after
four
hours
tedious
progress
we
suddenly
emerged
on
the
open
stream
where
the
moonlight
glittered
in
broad
sheets
on
the
gently
rippling
waters
a
little
extra
care
was
now
required
in
paddling
the
indians
plied
their
strokes
with
the
greatest
nicety
the
lights
of
ega
the
oil
lamps
in
the
houses
soon
appeared
beyond
the
black
wall
of
forest
and
in
a
short
time
we
leapt
safely
ashore
a
few
months
after
the
excursion
just
narrated
i
accompanied
cardozo
in
many
wanderings
on
the
solimoens
during
which
he
visited
the
praias
the
turtle
pools
in
the
forests
and
the
and
lakes
of
the
great
desert
river
his
object
was
mainly
to
superintend
the
business
of
digging
up
turtle
eggs
on
the
sandbanks
having
been
elected
commandante
for
the
year
by
the
municipal
council
of
ega
of
the
praia
real
royal
of
shimuni
the
one
lying
nearest
to
ega
there
are
four
of
these
royal
praias
within
the
ega
district
a
distance
of
miles
from
the
town
all
of
which
are
visited
annually
by
the
ega
people
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
eggs
and
extracting
oil
from
their
yolks
each
has
its
commander
whose
business
is
to
make
arrangements
for
securing
to
every
inhabitant
an
equal
chance
in
the
egg
harvest
by
placing
sentinels
to
protect
the
turtles
whilst
laying
and
so
forth
the
pregnant
turtles
descend
from
the
interior
pools
to
the
main
river
in
july
and
august
before
the
outlets
dry
up
and
then
seek
in
countless
swarms
their
favourite
sand
islands
for
it
is
only
a
few
praias
that
are
selected
by
them
out
of
the
great
number
existing
the
young
animals
remain
in
the
pools
throughout
the
dry
season
these
breeding
places
of
turtles
then
lie
twenty
to
thirty
or
more
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
and
are
accessible
only
by
cutting
roads
through
the
dense
forest
we
left
ega
on
our
first
trip
to
visit
the
sentinels
while
the
turtles
were
yet
laying
on
the
of
september
our
canoe
was
a
stoutly
built
igarite
arranged
for
ten
paddlers
and
having
a
large
arched
toldo
at
the
stern
under
which
three
persons
could
sleep
pretty
comfortably
emerging
from
the
teffe
we
descended
rapidly
on
the
swift
current
of
the
solimoens
to
the
eastern
or
lower
end
of
the
large
wooded
island
of
baria
which
here
divides
the
river
into
two
great
channels
we
then
paddled
across
to
shimuni
which
lies
in
the
middle
of
the
northeasterly
channel
reaching
the
commencement
of
the
praia
an
hour
before
sunset
the
island
proper
is
about
three
miles
long
and
half
a
mile
broad
the
forest
with
which
it
is
covered
rises
to
an
immense
and
uniform
height
and
presents
all
round
a
compact
impervious
front
here
and
there
a
singular
tree
called
pao
mulatto
mulatto
wood
with
polished
trunk
rose
conspicuously
among
the
mass
of
vegetation
the
sandbank
which
lies
at
the
upper
end
of
the
island
extends
several
miles
and
presents
an
irregular
and
in
some
parts
surface
with
deep
hollows
and
ridges
when
upon
it
one
feels
as
though
treading
an
almost
boundless
field
of
sand
for
towards
the
southeast
where
no
forest
line
terminates
the
view
the
white
rolling
plain
stretches
away
to
the
horizon
the
channel
of
the
river
lying
between
the
sands
and
the
further
shore
of
the
river
is
at
least
two
miles
in
breadth
the
middle
one
between
the
two
islands
shimuni
and
baria
is
not
much
less
than
a
mile
we
found
the
two
sentinels
lodged
in
a
corner
of
the
praia
where
it
commences
at
the
foot
of
the
towering
forest
wall
of
the
island
having
built
for
themselves
a
little
rancho
with
poles
and
great
precautions
are
obliged
to
be
taken
to
avoid
disturbing
the
sensitive
turtles
who
previous
to
crawling
ashore
to
lay
assemble
in
great
shoals
off
the
sandbank
the
men
during
this
time
take
care
not
to
show
themselves
and
warn
off
any
fishermen
who
wishes
to
pass
near
the
place
their
fires
are
made
in
a
deep
hollow
near
the
borders
of
the
forest
so
that
the
smoke
may
not
be
visible
the
passage
of
a
boat
through
the
shallow
waters
where
the
animals
are
congregated
or
the
sight
of
a
man
or
a
fire
on
the
sandbank
would
prevent
the
turtles
from
leaving
the
water
that
night
to
lay
their
eggs
and
if
the
causes
of
alarm
were
repeated
once
or
twice
they
would
forsake
the
praia
for
some
other
quieter
place
soon
after
we
arrived
our
men
were
sent
with
the
net
to
catch
a
supply
of
fish
for
supper
in
half
an
hour
four
or
five
large
basketsful
of
acari
were
brought
in
the
sun
set
soon
after
our
meal
was
cooked
we
were
then
obliged
to
extinguish
the
fire
and
remove
our
supper
materials
to
the
sleeping
ground
a
spit
of
sand
about
a
mile
off
this
course
being
necessary
on
account
of
the
mosquitoes
which
swarm
at
night
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
one
of
the
sentinels
was
a
taciturn
but
sober
and
honest
indian
named
daniel
the
other
was
a
noted
character
of
ega
a
little
wiry
mameluco
named
carepira
known
for
his
waggery
propensity
for
strong
drink
and
indebtedness
to
ega
traders
both
were
intrepid
canoemen
and
huntsmen
and
both
perfectly
at
home
anywhere
in
these
fearful
wastes
of
forest
and
water
carepira
had
his
son
with
him
a
quiet
little
lad
of
about
nine
years
of
age
these
men
in
a
few
minutes
constructed
a
small
shed
with
four
upright
poles
and
leaves
of
the
under
which
cardozo
and
i
slung
our
hammocks
we
did
not
go
to
sleep
however
until
after
midnight
for
when
supper
was
over
we
lay
about
on
the
sand
with
a
flask
of
rum
in
our
midst
and
whiled
away
the
still
hours
in
listening
to
carepira
stories
i
rose
from
my
hammock
by
daylight
shivering
with
cold
a
praia
on
account
of
the
great
radiation
of
heat
in
the
night
from
the
sand
being
towards
the
dawn
the
coldest
place
that
can
be
found
in
this
climate
cardozo
and
the
men
were
already
up
watching
the
turtles
the
sentinels
had
erected
for
this
purpose
a
stage
about
fifty
feet
high
on
a
tall
tree
near
their
station
the
ascent
to
which
was
by
a
ladder
of
woody
lianas
they
are
enabled
by
observing
the
turtles
from
this
watchtower
to
ascertain
the
date
of
successive
deposits
of
eggs
and
thus
guide
the
commandante
in
fixing
the
time
for
the
general
invitation
to
the
ega
people
the
turtles
lay
their
eggs
by
night
leaving
the
water
when
nothing
disturbs
them
in
vast
crowds
and
crawling
to
the
central
and
highest
part
of
the
praia
these
places
are
of
course
the
last
to
go
under
water
when
in
unusually
wet
seasons
the
river
rises
before
the
eggs
are
hatched
by
the
heat
of
the
sand
one
could
almost
believe
from
this
that
the
animals
used
forethought
in
choosing
a
place
but
it
is
simply
one
of
those
many
instances
in
animals
where
unconscious
habit
has
the
same
result
as
conscious
prevision
the
hours
between
midnight
and
dawn
are
the
busiest
the
turtles
excavate
with
their
broad
webbed
paws
deep
holes
in
the
fine
sand
the
first
corner
in
each
case
making
a
pit
about
three
feet
deep
laying
its
eggs
about
in
number
and
covering
them
with
sand
the
next
making
its
deposit
at
the
top
of
that
of
its
predecessor
and
so
on
until
every
pit
is
full
the
whole
body
of
turtles
frequenting
a
praia
does
not
finish
laying
in
less
than
fourteen
or
fifteen
days
even
when
there
is
no
interruption
when
all
have
done
the
area
called
by
the
brazilians
taboleiro
over
which
they
have
excavated
is
distinguishable
from
the
rest
of
the
praia
only
by
signs
of
the
sand
having
been
a
little
disturbed
on
rising
i
went
to
join
my
friends
few
recollections
of
my
amazonian
rambles
are
more
vivid
and
agreeable
than
that
of
my
walk
over
the
white
sea
of
sand
on
this
cool
morning
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
sun
was
hidden
behind
the
dark
mass
of
woods
on
shimuni
but
the
long
line
of
forest
to
the
west
on
baria
with
its
plumy
decorations
of
palms
was
lighted
up
with
his
yellow
horizontal
rays
a
faint
chorus
of
singing
birds
reached
the
ears
from
across
the
water
and
flocks
of
gulls
and
plovers
were
drying
plaintively
over
the
swelling
banks
of
the
praia
where
their
eggs
lay
in
nests
made
in
little
hollows
of
the
sand
tracks
of
stray
turtles
were
visible
on
the
smooth
white
surface
of
the
praia
the
animals
which
thus
wander
from
the
main
body
are
lawful
prizes
of
the
sentinels
they
had
caught
in
this
way
two
before
sunrise
one
of
which
we
had
for
dinner
in
my
walk
i
disturbed
several
pairs
of
the
chocolate
and
coloured
anser
jubatus
which
set
off
to
run
along
the
edge
of
the
water
the
enjoyment
one
feels
in
rambling
over
these
free
open
spaces
is
no
doubt
enhanced
by
the
novelty
of
the
scene
the
change
being
very
great
from
the
monotonous
landscape
of
forest
which
everywhere
else
presents
itself
on
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
i
mounted
the
stage
just
in
time
to
see
the
turtles
retreating
to
the
water
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
after
having
laid
their
eggs
the
sight
was
well
worth
the
trouble
of
ascending
the
shaky
ladder
they
were
about
a
mile
off
but
the
surface
of
the
sands
was
blackened
with
the
multitudes
which
were
waddling
towards
the
river
the
margin
of
the
praia
was
rather
steep
and
they
all
seemed
to
tumble
head
first
down
the
declivity
into
the
water
i
spent
the
morning
of
the
collecting
insects
in
the
woods
of
shimuni
and
assisted
my
friend
in
the
afternoon
to
beat
a
large
pool
for
tracajas
cardozo
wishing
to
obtain
a
supply
for
his
table
at
home
the
pool
was
nearly
a
mile
long
and
lay
on
one
side
of
the
island
between
the
forest
and
the
the
sands
are
heaped
up
very
curiously
around
the
margins
of
these
isolated
sheets
of
water
in
the
present
case
they
formed
a
bank
from
five
to
eight
feet
in
height
what
may
be
the
cause
of
this
formation
i
can
not
imagine
the
pools
always
contain
a
quantity
of
imprisoned
fish
turtles
tracajas
and
aiyussas
specimens
of
this
species
of
turtle
are
named
in
the
british
museum
collection
podocnemis
expansa
the
turtles
and
aiyussas
crawl
out
voluntarily
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
and
escape
to
the
main
river
but
the
tracajas
remain
and
become
an
easy
prey
to
the
natives
the
ordinary
mode
of
obtaining
them
is
to
whip
the
water
in
every
part
with
rods
for
several
hours
during
the
day
this
treatment
having
the
effect
of
driving
the
animals
out
they
wait
however
until
the
night
following
the
beating
before
making
their
exit
our
indians
were
occupied
for
many
hours
in
this
work
and
when
night
came
they
and
the
sentinels
were
placed
at
intervals
along
the
edge
of
the
water
to
be
ready
to
capture
the
runaways
cardozo
and
i
after
supper
went
and
took
our
station
at
one
end
of
the
pool
we
did
not
succeed
after
all
our
trouble
in
getting
many
tracajas
this
was
partly
owing
to
the
intense
darkness
of
the
night
and
partly
doubtless
to
the
sentinels
having
already
nearly
exhausted
the
pool
notwithstanding
their
declarations
to
the
contrary
in
waiting
for
the
animals
it
was
necessary
to
keep
silence
not
a
pleasant
way
of
passing
the
night
speaking
only
in
whispers
and
being
without
fire
in
a
place
liable
to
be
visited
by
a
prowling
jaguar
cardozo
and
i
sat
on
a
sandy
slope
with
our
loaded
guns
by
our
side
but
it
was
so
dark
we
could
scarcely
see
each
other
towards
midnight
a
storm
began
to
gather
around
us
the
faint
wind
which
had
breathed
from
over
the
water
since
the
sun
went
down
ceased
thick
clouds
piled
themselves
up
until
every
star
was
obscured
and
gleams
of
watery
lightning
began
to
play
in
the
midst
of
the
black
masses
i
hinted
to
cardozo
that
i
thought
we
had
now
had
enough
of
watching
and
suggested
a
cigarette
just
then
a
quick
pattering
movement
was
heard
on
the
sands
and
grasping
our
guns
we
both
started
to
our
feet
whatever
it
might
have
been
it
seemed
to
pass
by
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
a
dark
body
appeared
to
be
moving
in
another
direction
on
the
opposite
slope
of
the
sandy
ravine
where
we
lay
we
prepared
to
fire
but
luckily
took
the
precaution
of
first
shouting
quem
vai
la
who
goes
there
it
turned
out
to
be
the
taciturn
sentinel
daniel
who
asked
us
mildly
whether
we
had
heard
a
raposa
pass
our
way
the
raposa
is
a
kind
of
wild
dog
with
very
long
tapering
muzzle
and
black
and
white
speckled
hair
daniel
could
distinguish
all
kinds
of
animals
in
the
dark
by
their
footsteps
it
now
began
to
thunder
and
our
position
was
getting
very
uncomfortable
daniel
had
not
seen
anything
of
the
other
indians
and
thought
it
was
useless
waiting
any
longer
for
tracajas
we
therefore
sent
him
to
call
in
the
whole
party
and
made
off
ourselves
as
quickly
as
we
could
for
the
canoe
the
rest
of
the
night
was
passed
most
miserably
as
indeed
were
very
many
of
my
nights
on
the
solimoens
a
furious
squall
burst
upon
us
the
wind
blew
away
the
cloths
and
mats
we
had
fixed
up
at
the
ends
of
the
arched
awning
of
the
canoe
to
shelter
ourselves
and
the
rain
beat
right
through
our
place
there
we
lay
cardozo
and
i
huddled
together
and
wet
through
waiting
for
the
morning
a
cup
of
strong
and
hot
coffee
put
us
to
rights
at
sunrise
but
the
rain
was
still
coming
down
having
changed
to
a
steady
drizzle
our
men
were
all
returned
from
the
pool
having
taken
only
four
tracajas
the
business
which
had
brought
cardozo
hither
being
now
finished
we
set
out
to
return
to
ega
leaving
the
sentinels
once
more
to
their
solitude
on
the
sands
our
return
route
was
by
the
rarely
frequented
channel
of
the
solimoens
through
which
flows
part
of
the
waters
of
its
great
tributary
stream
the
japura
we
travelled
for
five
hours
along
the
desolate
broken
shore
of
baria
the
channel
is
of
immense
breadth
the
opposite
coast
being
visible
only
as
a
long
low
line
of
forest
at
three
in
the
afternoon
we
doubled
the
upper
end
of
the
island
and
then
crossed
towards
the
mouth
of
the
teffe
by
a
broad
transverse
channel
running
between
baria
and
another
island
called
quanaru
there
is
a
small
bank
at
the
point
of
baria
called
jacare
we
stayed
here
to
dine
and
afterwards
fished
with
the
net
a
fine
rain
was
still
falling
and
we
had
capital
sport
in
three
hauls
taking
more
fish
than
our
canoe
would
conveniently
hold
they
were
of
two
kinds
only
the
surubim
and
the
piraepieua
species
of
pimelodus
very
handsome
fishes
four
feet
in
length
with
flat
heads
and
and
striped
skins
on
our
way
from
jacare
to
the
mouth
of
the
teffe
we
had
a
little
adventure
with
a
black
tiger
or
jaguar
we
were
paddling
rapidly
past
a
long
beach
of
dried
mud
when
the
indians
became
suddenly
excited
shouting
ecui
jauarete
jauaripixuna
behold
the
jaguar
the
black
jaguar
looking
ahead
we
saw
the
animal
quietly
drinking
at
the
water
edge
cardozo
ordered
the
steersman
at
once
to
put
us
ashore
by
the
time
we
were
landed
the
tiger
had
seen
us
and
was
retracing
his
steps
towards
the
forest
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
without
thinking
of
what
we
were
doing
we
took
our
guns
mine
was
a
with
one
charge
of
b
b
and
one
of
and
gave
chase
the
animal
increased
his
speed
and
reaching
the
forest
border
dived
into
the
dense
mass
of
grass
which
formed
its
frontage
we
peeped
through
the
gap
he
had
made
but
our
courage
being
by
this
time
cooled
we
did
not
think
it
wise
to
go
into
the
thicket
after
him
the
black
tiger
appears
to
be
more
abundant
than
the
spotted
form
of
jaguar
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ega
the
most
certain
method
of
finding
it
is
to
hunt
assisted
by
a
string
of
indians
shouting
and
driving
the
game
before
them
in
the
narrow
restingas
or
strips
of
dry
land
in
the
forest
which
are
isolated
by
the
flooding
of
their
neighbourhood
in
the
wet
season
we
reached
ega
by
eight
that
night
on
the
of
october
we
left
ega
on
a
second
excursion
the
principal
object
of
cardozo
being
this
time
to
search
certain
pools
in
the
forest
for
young
turtles
the
exact
situation
of
these
hidden
sheets
of
water
is
known
only
to
a
few
practised
huntsmen
we
took
one
of
these
men
with
us
from
ega
a
mameluco
named
pedro
and
on
our
way
called
at
shimuni
for
daniel
to
serve
as
an
additional
guide
we
started
from
the
praia
at
sunrise
on
the
in
two
canoes
containing
persons
nineteen
of
whom
were
indians
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
cool
and
a
fresh
wind
blew
from
down
river
against
which
we
had
to
struggle
with
all
the
force
of
our
paddles
aided
by
the
current
the
boats
were
tossed
about
most
disagreeably
and
shipped
a
great
deal
of
water
on
passing
the
lower
end
of
shimuni
a
long
reach
of
the
river
was
before
us
undivided
by
islands
a
magnificent
expanse
of
water
stretching
away
to
the
southeast
the
country
on
the
left
bank
is
not
however
terra
firma
but
a
portion
of
the
alluvial
land
which
forms
the
extensive
and
complex
delta
region
of
the
japura
it
is
flooded
every
year
at
the
time
of
high
water
and
is
traversed
by
many
narrow
and
deep
channels
which
serve
as
outlets
to
the
japura
or
at
least
are
connected
with
that
river
by
means
of
the
interior
of
the
cupiyo
this
inhospitable
tract
of
country
extends
for
several
hundred
miles
and
contains
in
its
midst
an
endless
number
of
pools
and
lakes
tenanted
by
multitudes
of
turtles
fishes
alligators
and
water
serpents
our
destination
was
a
point
on
this
coast
situated
about
twenty
miles
below
shimuni
and
a
short
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
anana
one
of
the
channels
just
alluded
to
as
connected
with
the
japura
after
travelling
for
three
hours
in
midstream
we
steered
for
the
land
and
brought
to
under
a
bank
of
crumbly
earth
shaped
into
a
succession
of
steps
or
terraces
marking
the
various
halts
which
the
waters
of
the
river
make
in
the
course
of
subsidence
the
coast
line
was
nearly
straight
for
many
miles
and
the
bank
averaged
about
thirty
feet
in
height
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
at
the
top
rose
the
unbroken
hedge
of
forest
no
one
could
have
divined
that
pools
of
water
existed
on
that
elevated
land
a
narrow
level
space
extended
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
on
landing
the
first
business
was
to
get
breakfast
while
a
couple
of
indian
lads
were
employed
in
making
the
fire
roasting
the
fish
and
boiling
the
coffee
the
rest
of
the
party
mounted
the
bank
and
with
their
long
hunting
knives
commenced
cutting
a
path
through
the
forest
the
pool
called
the
aningal
being
about
half
a
mile
distant
after
breakfast
a
great
number
of
short
poles
were
cut
and
were
laid
crosswise
on
the
path
and
then
three
light
montarias
which
we
had
brought
with
us
were
dragged
up
the
bank
by
lianas
and
rolled
away
to
be
embarked
on
the
pool
a
large
net
seventy
yards
in
length
was
then
disembarked
and
carried
to
the
place
the
work
was
done
very
speedily
and
when
cardozo
and
i
went
to
the
spot
at
eleven
we
found
some
of
the
older
indians
including
pedro
and
daniel
had
begun
their
sport
they
were
mounted
on
little
stages
called
moutas
made
of
poles
and
of
wood
secured
with
lianas
and
were
shooting
the
turtles
as
they
came
near
the
surface
with
bows
and
arrows
the
indians
seemed
to
think
that
netting
the
animals
as
cardozo
proposed
doing
was
not
lawful
sport
and
wished
first
to
have
an
hour
or
two
practice
with
their
weapons
the
pool
covered
an
area
of
about
four
or
five
acres
and
was
closely
hemmed
in
by
the
forest
which
in
picturesque
variety
and
grouping
of
trees
and
foliage
exceeded
almost
everything
i
had
yet
witnessed
the
margins
for
some
distance
were
swampy
and
covered
with
large
tufts
of
a
fine
grass
called
matupa
these
tufts
in
many
places
were
overrun
with
ferns
and
exterior
to
them
a
crowded
row
of
arborescent
arums
growing
to
a
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
formed
a
green
palisade
around
the
whole
stood
the
taller
forest
trees
cecropiae
slender
assai
palms
thirty
feet
high
with
their
thin
feathery
heads
crowning
the
smooth
stems
small
palms
and
as
a
background
to
all
these
airy
shapes
lay
the
voluminous
masses
of
ordinary
forest
trees
with
garlands
festoons
and
streamers
of
leafy
climbers
hanging
from
their
branches
the
pool
was
nowhere
more
than
five
feet
deep
one
foot
of
which
was
not
water
but
extremely
fine
and
soft
mud
cardozo
and
i
spent
an
hour
paddling
about
i
was
astonished
at
the
skill
which
the
indians
display
in
shooting
turtles
they
did
not
wait
for
their
coming
to
the
surface
to
breathe
but
watched
for
the
slight
movements
in
the
water
which
revealed
their
presence
underneath
these
little
tracks
on
the
water
are
called
the
siriri
the
instant
one
was
perceived
an
arrow
flew
from
the
bow
of
the
nearest
man
and
never
failed
to
pierce
the
shell
of
the
submerged
animal
when
the
turtle
was
very
distant
of
course
the
aim
had
to
be
taken
at
a
considerable
elevation
but
the
marksmen
preferred
a
longish
range
because
the
arrow
then
fell
more
perpendicularly
on
the
shell
and
entered
it
more
deeply
the
arrow
used
in
turtle
shooting
has
a
strong
steel
point
fitted
into
a
peg
which
enters
the
tip
of
the
shaft
the
peg
is
secured
to
the
shaft
by
twine
made
of
the
fibres
of
pineapple
leaves
the
twine
being
some
thirty
or
forty
yards
in
length
and
neatly
wound
round
the
body
of
the
arrow
when
the
missile
enters
the
shell
the
peg
drops
out
and
the
pierced
animal
descends
with
it
towards
the
bottom
leaving
the
shaft
floating
on
the
surface
this
being
done
the
sportsman
paddles
in
his
montaria
to
the
place
and
gently
draws
the
animal
by
the
twine
humouring
it
by
giving
it
the
rein
when
it
plunges
until
it
is
brought
again
near
the
surface
when
he
strikes
it
with
a
second
arrow
with
the
increased
hold
given
by
the
two
cords
he
has
then
no
difficulty
in
landing
his
game
by
the
men
had
shot
about
a
score
of
nearly
turtles
cardozo
then
gave
orders
to
spread
the
net
the
spongy
swampy
nature
of
the
banks
made
it
impossible
to
work
the
net
so
as
to
draw
the
booty
ashore
another
method
was
therefore
adopted
the
net
was
taken
by
two
indians
and
extended
in
a
curve
at
one
extremity
of
the
pool
holding
it
when
they
had
done
so
by
the
perpendicular
rods
fixed
at
each
end
its
breadth
was
about
equal
to
the
depth
of
the
water
its
shotted
side
therefore
rested
on
the
bottom
while
the
floats
buoyed
it
up
on
the
surface
so
that
the
whole
when
the
ends
were
brought
together
would
form
a
complete
trap
the
rest
of
the
party
then
spread
themselves
around
the
swamp
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
pool
and
began
to
beat
with
stout
poles
the
thick
tufts
of
matupa
in
order
to
drive
the
turtles
towards
the
middle
this
was
continued
for
an
hour
or
more
the
beaters
gradually
drawing
nearer
to
each
other
and
driving
the
host
of
animals
before
them
the
number
of
little
snouts
constantly
popping
above
the
surface
of
the
water
showing
that
all
was
going
on
well
when
they
neared
the
net
the
men
moved
more
quickly
shouting
and
beating
with
great
vigour
the
ends
of
the
net
were
then
seized
by
several
strong
hands
and
dragged
suddenly
forwards
bringing
them
at
the
same
time
together
so
as
to
enclose
all
the
booty
in
a
circle
every
man
now
leapt
into
the
enclosure
the
boats
were
brought
up
and
the
turtles
easily
captured
by
the
hand
and
tossed
into
them
i
jumped
in
along
with
the
rest
although
i
had
just
before
made
the
discovery
that
the
pool
abounded
in
ugly
red
leeches
having
seen
several
of
these
delectable
animals
which
sometimes
fasten
on
the
legs
of
fishermen
although
they
did
not
on
this
day
trouble
us
working
their
way
through
cracks
in
the
bottom
of
our
montaria
cardozo
who
remained
with
the
boats
could
not
turn
the
animals
on
their
backs
fast
enough
so
that
a
great
many
clambered
out
and
got
free
again
however
three
or
about
eighty
were
secured
in
about
twenty
minutes
they
were
then
taken
ashore
and
each
one
secured
by
the
men
tying
the
legs
with
thongs
of
bast
when
the
canoes
had
been
twice
filled
we
desisted
after
a
very
hard
day
work
nearly
all
the
animals
were
young
ones
chiefly
according
to
the
statement
of
pedro
from
three
to
ten
years
of
age
they
varied
from
six
to
eighteen
inches
in
length
and
were
very
fat
cardozo
and
i
lived
almost
exclusively
on
them
for
several
months
afterwards
roasted
in
the
shell
they
form
a
most
appetising
dish
these
younger
turtles
never
migrate
with
their
elders
on
the
sinking
of
the
waters
but
remain
in
the
tepid
pools
fattening
on
fallen
fruits
and
according
to
the
natives
on
the
fine
nutritious
mud
we
captured
a
few
motherturtles
which
were
known
at
once
by
the
horny
skin
of
their
being
worn
telling
of
their
having
crawled
on
the
sands
to
lay
eggs
the
previous
year
they
had
evidently
made
a
mistake
in
not
leaving
the
pool
at
the
proper
time
for
they
were
full
of
eggs
which
we
were
told
they
would
before
the
season
was
over
scatter
in
despair
over
the
swamp
we
also
found
several
male
turtles
or
capitaris
as
they
are
called
by
the
natives
these
are
immensely
less
numerous
than
the
females
and
are
distinguishable
by
their
much
smaller
size
more
circular
shape
and
the
greater
length
and
thickness
of
their
tails
their
flesh
is
considered
unwholesome
especially
to
sick
people
having
external
signs
of
inflammation
all
diseases
in
these
parts
as
well
as
their
remedies
and
all
articles
of
food
are
classed
by
the
inhabitants
as
hot
and
cold
and
the
meat
of
the
capitari
is
settled
by
unanimous
consent
as
belonging
to
the
hot
list
we
dined
on
the
banks
of
the
river
a
little
before
sunset
the
mosquitoes
then
began
to
be
troublesome
and
finding
it
would
be
impossible
to
sleep
here
we
all
embarked
and
crossed
the
river
to
a
about
three
miles
distant
where
we
passed
the
night
cardozo
and
i
slept
in
our
hammocks
slung
between
upright
poles
the
rest
stretching
themselves
on
the
sand
round
a
large
fire
we
lay
awake
conversing
until
past
midnight
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
listen
to
the
stories
told
by
one
of
the
older
men
they
were
given
with
so
much
spirit
the
tales
always
related
to
struggles
with
some
intractable
manatee
or
alligator
many
interjections
and
expressive
gestures
were
used
and
at
the
end
came
a
sudden
pa
terra
when
the
animal
was
vanquished
by
a
shot
or
a
blow
many
mysterious
tales
were
recounted
about
the
bouto
as
the
large
dolphin
of
the
amazons
is
called
one
of
them
was
to
the
effect
that
a
bouto
once
had
the
habit
of
assuming
the
shape
of
a
beautiful
woman
with
hair
hanging
loose
to
her
heels
and
walking
ashore
at
night
in
the
streets
of
ega
to
entice
the
young
men
down
to
the
water
if
any
one
was
so
much
smitten
as
to
follow
her
to
the
waterside
she
grasped
her
victim
round
the
waist
and
plunged
beneath
the
waves
with
a
triumphant
cry
no
animal
in
the
amazons
region
is
the
subject
of
so
many
fables
as
the
bouto
but
it
is
probable
these
did
not
originate
with
the
indians
but
with
the
portuguese
colonists
it
was
several
years
before
i
could
induce
a
fisherman
to
harpoon
dolphins
for
me
as
specimens
for
no
one
ever
kills
these
animals
voluntarily
although
their
fat
is
known
to
yield
an
excellent
oil
for
lamps
the
superstitious
people
believe
that
blindness
would
result
from
the
use
of
this
oil
in
lamps
i
succeeded
at
length
with
carepira
by
offering
him
a
high
reward
when
his
finances
were
at
a
very
low
point
but
he
repented
of
his
deed
ever
afterwards
declaring
that
his
luck
had
forsaken
him
from
that
day
the
next
morning
we
again
beat
the
pool
although
we
had
proof
of
there
being
a
great
number
of
turtles
yet
remaining
we
had
very
poor
success
the
old
indians
told
us
it
would
be
so
for
the
turtles
were
ladino
cunning
and
would
take
no
notice
of
the
beating
a
second
day
when
the
net
was
formed
into
a
circle
and
the
men
had
jumped
in
an
alligator
was
found
to
be
inclosed
no
one
was
alarmed
the
only
fear
expressed
being
that
the
imprisoned
beast
would
tear
the
net
first
one
shouted
i
have
touched
his
head
then
another
he
has
scratched
my
leg
one
of
the
men
a
lanky
miranha
was
thrown
off
his
balance
and
then
there
was
no
end
to
the
laughter
and
shouting
at
last
a
youth
of
about
fourteen
years
of
age
on
my
calling
to
him
from
the
bank
to
do
so
seized
the
reptile
by
the
tail
and
held
him
tightly
until
a
little
resistance
being
overcome
he
was
able
to
bring
it
ashore
the
net
was
opened
and
the
boy
slowly
dragged
the
dangerous
but
cowardly
beast
to
land
through
the
muddy
water
a
distance
of
about
a
hundred
yards
meantime
i
had
cut
a
strong
pole
from
a
tree
and
as
soon
as
the
alligator
was
drawn
to
solid
ground
gave
him
a
smart
rap
with
it
on
the
crown
of
his
head
which
killed
him
instantly
it
was
a
individual
the
jaws
being
considerably
more
than
a
foot
long
and
fully
capable
of
snapping
a
man
leg
in
twain
the
species
was
the
large
cayman
the
jacareuassu
of
the
amazonian
indians
jacare
nigra
on
the
third
day
we
sent
our
men
in
the
boats
to
net
turtles
in
a
larger
pool
about
five
miles
further
down
the
river
and
on
the
fourth
returned
to
ega
it
will
be
well
to
mention
here
a
few
circumstances
relative
to
the
large
cayman
which
with
the
incident
just
narrated
afford
illustrations
of
the
cunning
cowardice
and
ferocity
of
this
reptile
i
have
hitherto
had
but
few
occasions
of
mentioning
alligators
although
they
exist
by
myriads
in
the
waters
of
the
upper
amazons
many
different
species
are
spoken
of
by
the
natives
i
saw
only
three
and
of
these
two
only
are
common
one
the
a
small
kind
five
feet
long
when
full
grown
having
a
long
slender
muzzle
and
a
tail
the
other
the
to
which
these
remarks
more
especially
relate
and
the
third
the
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
the
or
large
cayman
grows
to
a
length
of
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
and
attains
an
enormous
bulk
like
the
turtles
the
alligator
has
its
annual
migrations
for
it
retreats
to
the
interior
pools
and
flooded
forests
in
the
wet
season
and
descends
to
the
main
river
in
the
dry
season
during
the
months
of
high
water
therefore
scarcely
a
single
individual
is
to
be
seen
in
the
main
river
in
the
middle
part
of
the
lower
amazons
about
obydos
and
villa
nova
where
many
of
the
lakes
with
their
channels
of
communication
with
the
trunk
stream
dry
up
in
the
fine
months
the
alligator
buries
itself
in
the
mud
and
becomes
dormant
sleeping
till
the
rainy
season
returns
on
the
upper
amazons
where
the
dry
season
is
never
excessive
it
has
not
this
habit
but
is
lively
all
the
year
round
it
is
scarcely
exaggerating
to
say
that
the
waters
of
the
solimoens
are
as
well
stocked
with
large
alligators
in
the
dry
season
as
a
ditch
in
england
is
in
summer
with
tadpoles
during
a
journey
of
five
days
which
i
once
made
in
the
upper
amazons
steamer
in
november
alligators
were
seen
along
the
coast
almost
every
step
of
the
way
and
the
passengers
amused
themselves
from
morning
till
night
by
firing
at
them
with
rifle
and
ball
they
were
very
numerous
in
the
still
bays
where
the
huddled
crowds
jostled
together
to
the
great
rattling
of
their
coats
of
mail
as
the
steamer
passed
the
natives
at
once
despise
and
fear
the
great
cayman
i
once
spent
a
month
at
caicara
a
small
village
of
indians
about
twenty
miles
to
the
west
of
ega
my
entertainer
the
only
white
in
the
place
and
one
of
my
best
and
most
constant
friends
senor
innocencio
alves
faria
one
day
proposed
a
day
fishing
with
net
in
the
lake
the
expanded
bed
of
the
small
river
on
which
the
village
is
situated
we
set
out
in
an
open
boat
with
six
indians
and
two
of
innocencio
children
the
water
had
sunk
so
low
that
the
net
had
to
be
taken
out
into
the
middle
by
the
indians
whence
at
the
first
draught
two
alligators
were
brought
to
land
they
were
disengaged
from
the
net
and
allowed
with
the
coolest
unconcern
to
return
to
the
water
although
the
two
children
were
playing
in
it
not
many
yards
off
we
continued
fishing
innocencio
and
i
lending
a
helping
hand
and
each
time
drew
a
number
of
the
reptiles
of
different
ages
and
sizes
some
of
them
the
lake
in
fact
swarmed
with
alligators
after
taking
a
very
large
quantity
of
fish
we
prepared
to
return
and
the
indians
at
my
suggestion
secured
one
of
the
alligators
with
the
view
of
letting
it
loose
amongst
the
swarms
of
dogs
in
the
village
an
individual
was
selected
about
eight
feet
long
one
man
holding
his
head
and
another
his
tail
whilst
a
third
took
a
few
lengths
of
a
flexible
liana
and
deliberately
bound
the
jaws
and
the
legs
thus
secured
the
beast
was
laid
across
the
benches
of
the
boat
on
which
we
sat
during
the
hour
and
a
half
journey
to
the
settlement
we
were
rather
crowded
but
our
amiable
passenger
gave
us
no
trouble
during
the
transit
on
reaching
the
village
we
took
the
animal
into
the
middle
of
the
green
in
front
of
the
church
where
the
dogs
were
congregated
and
there
gave
him
his
liberty
two
of
us
arming
ourselves
with
long
poles
to
intercept
him
if
he
should
make
for
the
water
and
the
others
exciting
the
dogs
the
alligator
showed
great
terror
although
the
dogs
could
not
be
made
to
advance
and
made
off
at
the
top
of
its
speed
for
the
water
waddling
like
a
duck
we
tried
to
keep
him
back
with
the
poles
but
he
became
enraged
and
seizing
the
end
of
the
one
i
held
in
his
jaws
nearly
wrenched
it
from
my
grasp
we
were
obliged
at
length
to
kill
him
to
prevent
his
escape
these
little
incidents
show
the
timidity
or
cowardice
of
the
alligator
he
never
attacks
man
when
his
intended
victim
is
on
his
guard
but
he
is
cunning
enough
to
know
when
this
may
be
done
with
impunity
of
this
we
had
proof
at
caicara
a
few
days
afterwards
the
river
had
sunk
to
a
very
low
point
so
that
the
port
and
of
the
village
now
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
long
sloping
bank
and
a
large
cayman
made
his
appearance
in
the
shallow
and
muddy
water
we
were
all
obliged
to
be
very
careful
in
taking
our
bath
most
of
the
people
simply
using
a
calabash
pouring
the
water
over
themselves
while
standing
on
the
brink
a
large
trading
canoe
belonging
to
a
barra
merchant
named
soares
arrived
at
this
time
and
the
indian
crew
as
usual
spent
the
first
day
or
two
after
their
coming
into
port
in
drunkenness
and
debauchery
ashore
one
of
the
men
during
the
greatest
heat
of
the
day
when
almost
everyone
was
enjoying
his
afternoon
nap
took
it
into
his
head
while
in
a
tipsy
state
to
go
down
alone
to
bathe
he
was
seen
only
by
the
juiz
de
paz
a
feeble
old
man
who
was
lying
in
his
hammock
in
the
open
verandah
at
the
rear
of
his
house
on
the
top
of
the
bank
and
who
shouted
to
the
besotted
indian
to
beware
of
the
alligator
before
he
could
repeat
his
warning
the
man
stumbled
and
a
pair
of
gaping
jaws
appearing
suddenly
above
the
surface
seized
him
round
the
waist
and
drew
him
under
the
water
a
cry
of
agony
ai
jesus
was
the
last
sign
made
by
the
wretched
victim
the
village
was
aroused
the
young
men
with
praiseworthy
readiness
seized
their
harpoons
and
hurried
down
to
the
bank
but
of
course
it
was
too
late
a
winding
track
of
blood
on
the
surface
of
the
water
was
all
that
could
be
seen
they
embarked
however
in
montarias
determined
upon
vengeance
the
monster
was
traced
and
when
after
a
short
lapse
of
time
he
came
up
to
breathe
one
leg
of
the
man
sticking
out
from
his
jaws
was
despatched
with
bitter
curses
the
last
of
these
minor
excursions
which
i
shall
narrate
was
made
again
in
company
of
senor
cardozo
with
the
addition
of
his
housekeeper
senora
felippa
in
the
season
when
all
the
population
of
the
villages
turns
out
to
dig
up
turtle
eggs
and
revel
on
the
praias
placards
were
posted
on
the
church
doors
at
ega
announcing
that
the
excavation
on
shimuni
would
commence
on
the
of
october
and
on
catua
sixty
miles
below
shimuni
on
the
we
set
out
on
the
and
passed
on
the
road
in
our
igarite
a
large
number
of
people
men
women
and
children
in
canoes
of
all
sizes
wending
their
way
as
if
to
a
great
holiday
gathering
by
the
morning
of
the
some
persons
were
assembled
on
the
borders
of
the
each
family
having
erected
a
rude
temporary
shed
of
poles
and
palm
leaves
to
protect
themselves
from
the
sun
and
rain
large
copper
kettles
to
prepare
the
oil
and
hundreds
of
red
earthenware
jars
were
scattered
about
on
the
sand
the
excavation
of
the
taboleiro
collecting
the
eggs
and
purifying
the
oil
occupied
four
days
all
was
done
on
a
system
established
by
the
old
portuguese
governors
probably
more
than
a
century
ago
the
commandante
first
took
down
the
names
of
all
the
masters
of
households
with
the
number
of
persons
each
intended
to
employ
in
digging
he
then
exacted
a
payment
of
reis
about
fourpence
a
head
towards
defraying
the
expense
of
sentinels
the
whole
were
then
allowed
to
go
to
the
taboleiro
they
arranged
themselves
around
the
circle
each
person
armed
with
a
paddle
to
be
used
as
a
spade
and
then
all
began
simultaneously
to
dig
on
a
signal
being
given
the
roll
of
order
of
the
commandante
it
was
an
animating
sight
to
behold
the
wide
circle
of
rival
diggers
throwing
up
clouds
of
sand
in
their
energetic
labours
and
working
gradually
towards
the
centre
of
the
ring
a
little
rest
was
taken
during
the
great
heat
of
midday
and
in
the
evening
the
eggs
were
carried
to
the
huts
in
baskets
by
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
taboleiro
was
exhausted
large
mounds
of
eggs
some
of
them
four
to
five
feet
in
height
were
then
seen
by
the
side
of
each
hut
the
produce
of
the
labours
of
the
family
in
the
hurry
of
digging
some
of
the
deeper
nests
are
passed
over
to
find
these
out
the
people
go
about
provided
with
a
long
steel
or
wooden
probe
the
presence
of
the
eggs
being
discoverable
by
the
ease
with
which
the
spit
enters
the
sand
when
no
more
eggs
are
to
be
found
the
mashing
process
begins
the
egg
it
may
be
mentioned
has
a
flexible
or
leathery
shell
it
is
quite
round
and
somewhat
larger
than
a
hen
egg
the
whole
heap
is
thrown
into
an
empty
canoe
and
mashed
with
wooden
prongs
but
sometimes
naked
indians
and
children
jump
into
the
mass
and
tread
it
down
besmearing
themselves
with
yolk
and
making
about
as
filthy
a
scene
as
can
well
be
imagined
this
being
finished
water
is
poured
into
the
canoe
and
the
fatty
mess
then
left
for
a
few
hours
to
be
heated
by
the
sun
on
which
the
oil
separates
and
rises
to
the
surface
the
floating
oil
is
afterwards
skimmed
off
with
long
spoons
made
by
tying
large
to
the
end
of
rods
and
purified
over
the
fire
in
copper
kettles
the
destruction
of
turtle
eggs
every
year
by
these
proceedings
is
enormous
at
least
jars
holding
each
three
gallons
of
the
oil
are
exported
annually
from
the
upper
amazons
and
the
madeira
to
para
where
it
is
used
for
lighting
frying
fish
and
other
purposes
it
may
be
fairly
estimated
that
more
are
consumed
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
villages
on
the
river
now
it
takes
at
least
twelve
basketsful
of
eggs
or
about
by
the
wasteful
process
followed
to
make
one
jar
of
oil
the
total
number
of
eggs
annually
destroyed
amounts
therefore
to
as
each
turtle
lays
about
it
follows
that
the
yearly
offspring
of
turtles
is
thus
annihilated
a
vast
number
nevertheless
remain
undetected
and
these
would
probably
be
sufficient
to
keep
the
turtle
population
of
these
rivers
up
to
the
mark
if
the
people
did
not
follow
the
wasteful
practice
of
lying
in
wait
for
the
young
and
collecting
them
by
thousands
for
eating
their
tender
flesh
and
the
remains
of
yolk
in
their
entrails
being
considered
a
great
delicacy
the
chief
natural
enemies
of
the
turtle
are
vultures
and
alligators
which
devour
the
young
as
they
descend
in
shoals
to
the
water
these
must
have
destroyed
an
immensely
greater
number
before
the
european
settlers
began
to
appropriate
the
eggs
than
they
do
now
it
is
almost
doubtful
if
this
natural
persecution
did
not
act
as
effectively
in
checking
the
increase
of
the
turtle
as
the
artificial
destruction
now
does
if
we
are
to
believe
the
tradition
of
the
indians
however
it
had
not
this
result
for
they
say
that
formerly
the
waters
teemed
as
thickly
with
turtles
as
the
air
now
does
with
mosquitoes
the
universal
opinion
of
the
settlers
on
the
upper
amazons
is
that
the
turtle
has
very
greatly
decreased
in
numbers
and
is
still
annually
decreasing
we
left
shimuni
on
the
with
quite
a
flotilla
of
canoes
and
descended
the
river
to
catua
an
eleven
hours
journey
by
paddle
and
current
catua
is
about
six
miles
long
and
almost
entirely
encircled
by
its
praia
the
turtles
had
selected
for
their
laying
a
part
of
the
which
was
elevated
at
least
twenty
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
the
animals
to
reach
the
place
must
have
crawled
up
a
slope
as
we
approached
the
island
numbers
of
the
animals
were
seen
coming
to
the
surface
to
breathe
in
a
small
shoaly
bay
those
who
had
light
montarias
sped
forward
with
bows
and
arrows
to
shoot
them
carepira
was
foremost
having
borrowed
a
small
and
very
unsteady
boat
of
cardozo
and
embarked
in
it
with
his
little
son
after
bagging
a
couple
of
turtles
and
while
hauling
in
a
third
he
overbalanced
himself
the
canoe
went
over
and
he
with
his
child
had
to
swim
for
their
lives
in
the
midst
of
numerous
alligators
about
a
mile
from
the
land
the
old
man
had
to
sustain
a
heavy
fire
of
jokes
from
his
companions
for
several
days
after
this
mishap
such
accidents
are
only
laughed
at
by
this
almost
amphibious
people
the
number
of
persons
congregated
on
catua
was
much
greater
than
on
shimuni
as
the
population
of
the
banks
of
several
neighbouring
lakes
were
here
added
the
line
of
huts
and
sheds
extended
half
a
mile
and
several
large
sailing
vessels
were
anchored
at
the
place
the
commandante
was
senor
macedo
the
indian
blacksmith
of
ega
before
mentioned
who
maintained
excellent
order
during
the
fourteen
days
the
process
of
excavation
and
oil
manufacture
lasted
there
were
also
many
primitive
indians
here
from
the
neighbouring
rivers
among
them
a
family
of
shumanas
harmless
people
from
the
lower
japura
all
of
them
were
tattooed
around
the
mouth
the
bluish
tint
forming
a
border
to
the
lips
and
extending
in
a
line
on
the
cheeks
towards
the
ear
on
each
side
they
were
not
quite
so
slender
in
figure
as
the
passes
of
family
but
their
features
deviated
quite
as
much
as
those
of
the
passes
from
the
ordinary
indian
type
this
was
seen
chiefly
in
the
comparatively
small
mouth
pointed
chin
thin
lips
and
narrow
high
nose
one
of
the
daughters
a
young
girl
of
about
seventeen
years
of
age
was
a
real
beauty
the
colour
of
her
skin
approached
the
light
tanned
shade
of
the
mameluco
women
her
figure
was
almost
faultless
and
the
blue
mouth
instead
of
being
a
disfigurement
gave
quite
a
captivating
finish
to
her
appearance
her
neck
wrists
and
ankles
were
adorned
with
strings
of
blue
beads
she
was
however
extremely
bashful
never
venturing
to
look
strangers
in
the
face
and
never
quitting
for
many
minutes
together
the
side
of
her
father
and
mother
the
family
had
been
shamefully
swindled
by
some
rascally
trader
on
another
praia
and
on
our
arrival
came
to
lay
their
case
before
senor
cardozo
as
the
delegado
of
police
of
the
district
the
mild
way
in
which
the
old
man
without
a
trace
of
anger
stated
his
complaint
in
imperfect
tupi
quite
enlisted
our
sympathies
in
his
favour
but
cardozo
could
give
him
no
redress
he
invited
the
family
however
to
make
their
rancho
near
to
ours
and
in
the
end
gave
them
the
highest
price
for
the
surplus
oil
which
they
manufactured
it
was
not
all
work
at
catua
indeed
there
was
rather
more
play
than
work
going
on
the
people
make
a
kind
of
holiday
of
these
occasions
every
fine
night
parties
of
the
younger
people
assembled
on
the
sands
and
dancing
and
games
were
carried
on
for
hours
together
but
the
requisite
liveliness
for
these
sports
was
never
got
up
without
a
good
deal
of
preliminary
the
girls
were
so
coy
that
the
young
men
could
not
get
sufficient
partners
for
the
dances
without
first
subscribing
for
a
few
flagons
of
the
needful
cashaca
the
coldness
of
the
shy
indian
and
mameluco
maidens
never
failed
to
give
way
after
a
little
of
this
strong
drink
but
it
was
astonishing
what
an
immense
deal
they
could
take
of
it
in
the
course
of
an
evening
coyness
is
not
always
a
sign
of
innocence
in
these
people
for
most
of
the
caste
women
on
the
upper
amazons
lead
a
little
career
of
looseness
before
they
marry
and
settle
down
for
life
and
it
is
rather
remarkable
that
the
men
do
not
seem
to
object
much
to
their
brides
having
had
a
child
or
two
by
various
fathers
before
marriage
the
women
do
not
lose
reputation
unless
they
become
utterly
depraved
but
in
that
case
they
are
condemned
pretty
strongly
by
public
opinion
depravity
is
however
rare
for
all
require
more
or
less
to
be
wooed
before
they
are
won
i
did
not
see
although
i
mixed
pretty
freely
with
the
young
people
any
breach
of
propriety
on
the
praias
the
were
carried
on
near
the
ranchos
where
the
more
staid
citizens
of
ega
husbands
with
their
wives
and
young
daughters
all
smoking
gravely
out
of
long
pipes
sat
in
their
hammocks
and
enjoyed
the
fun
towards
midnight
we
often
heard
in
the
intervals
between
jokes
and
laughter
the
hoarse
roar
of
jaguars
prowling
about
the
jungle
in
the
middle
of
the
praia
there
were
several
players
among
the
young
men
and
one
most
persevering
fiddler
so
there
was
no
lack
of
music
the
favourite
sport
was
the
or
one
of
the
original
games
of
the
indians
though
now
probably
a
little
modified
the
young
men
and
women
mingling
together
formed
a
ring
leaving
one
of
their
number
in
the
middle
who
represented
the
fish
they
then
all
marched
round
indian
file
the
musicians
mixed
up
with
the
rest
singing
a
monotonous
but
rather
pretty
chorus
the
words
of
which
were
invented
under
a
certain
form
by
one
of
the
party
who
acted
as
leader
this
finished
all
joined
hands
and
questions
were
put
to
the
one
in
the
middle
asking
what
kind
of
fish
he
or
she
might
be
to
these
the
individual
has
to
reply
the
end
of
it
all
is
that
he
makes
a
rush
at
the
ring
and
if
he
succeeds
in
escaping
the
person
who
allowed
him
to
do
so
has
to
take
his
place
the
march
and
chorus
then
recommences
and
so
the
game
goes
on
hour
after
hour
tupi
was
the
language
mostly
used
but
sometimes
portuguese
was
sung
and
spoken
the
details
of
the
dance
were
often
varied
instead
of
the
names
of
fishes
being
called
over
by
the
person
in
the
middle
the
name
of
some
animal
flower
or
other
object
was
given
to
every
fresh
occupier
of
the
place
there
was
then
good
scope
for
wit
in
the
invention
of
nicknames
and
peals
of
laughter
would
often
salute
some
particularly
good
hit
thus
a
very
lanky
young
man
was
called
the
magoary
or
the
grey
stork
a
moist
man
with
a
profile
comically
suggestive
of
a
fish
was
christened
jaraki
a
kind
of
fish
which
was
considered
quite
a
witty
sally
a
little
mameluco
girl
with
eyes
and
brown
hair
got
the
gallant
name
of
rosa
blanca
or
the
white
rose
a
young
fellow
who
had
recently
singed
his
eye
brows
by
the
explosion
of
fireworks
was
dubbed
pedro
queimado
burnt
peter
in
short
every
one
got
a
nickname
and
each
time
the
cognomen
was
introduced
into
the
chorus
as
the
circle
marched
round
our
rancho
was
a
large
one
and
was
erected
in
a
line
with
the
others
near
the
edge
of
the
which
sloped
rather
abruptly
to
the
water
during
the
first
week
the
people
were
all
more
or
less
troubled
by
alligators
some
ones
were
in
attendance
off
the
praia
floating
about
on
the
muddy
water
the
dryness
of
the
weather
had
increased
since
we
had
left
shimuni
the
currents
had
slackened
and
the
heat
in
the
middle
part
of
the
day
was
almost
insupportable
but
no
one
could
descend
to
bathe
without
being
advanced
upon
by
one
or
other
of
these
hungry
monsters
there
was
much
offal
cast
into
the
river
and
this
of
course
attracted
them
to
the
place
one
day
i
amused
myself
by
taking
a
basketful
of
fragments
of
meat
beyond
the
line
of
ranchos
and
drawing
the
alligators
towards
me
by
feeding
them
they
behaved
pretty
much
as
dogs
do
when
fed
catching
the
bones
i
threw
them
in
their
huge
jaws
and
coming
nearer
and
showing
increased
eagerness
after
every
morsel
the
enormous
gape
of
their
mouths
with
their
lining
and
long
fringes
of
teeth
and
the
uncouth
shapes
of
their
bodies
made
a
picture
of
unsurpassable
ugliness
i
once
or
twice
fired
a
heavy
charge
of
shot
at
them
aiming
at
the
vulnerable
part
of
their
bodies
which
is
a
small
space
situated
behind
the
eyes
but
this
had
no
other
effect
than
to
make
them
give
a
hoarse
grunt
and
shake
themselves
they
immediately
afterwards
turned
to
receive
another
bone
which
i
threw
to
them
everyday
these
visitors
became
bolder
at
length
they
reached
a
pitch
of
impudence
that
was
quite
intolerable
cardozo
had
a
poodle
dog
named
carlito
which
some
grateful
traveller
whom
he
had
befriended
had
sent
him
from
rio
janeiro
he
took
great
pride
in
this
dog
keeping
it
well
sheared
and
preserving
his
coat
as
white
as
soap
and
water
could
make
it
we
slept
in
our
rancho
in
hammocks
slung
between
the
outer
posts
a
large
wood
fire
fed
with
a
kind
of
wood
abundant
on
the
banks
of
the
river
which
keeps
alight
all
night
being
made
in
the
middle
by
the
side
of
which
slept
carlito
on
a
little
mat
well
one
night
i
was
awoke
by
a
great
uproar
it
was
caused
by
cardozo
hurling
burning
firewood
with
loud
curses
at
a
huge
cayman
which
had
crawled
up
the
bank
and
passed
beneath
my
hammock
being
nearest
the
water
towards
the
place
where
carlito
lay
the
dog
had
raised
the
alarm
in
time
the
reptile
backed
out
and
tumbled
down
the
bank
to
the
water
the
sparks
from
the
brands
hurled
at
him
flying
from
his
bony
hide
to
our
great
surprise
the
animal
we
supposed
it
to
be
the
same
individual
repeated
his
visit
the
very
next
night
this
time
passing
round
to
the
other
side
of
our
shed
cardozo
was
awake
and
threw
a
harpoon
at
him
but
without
doing
him
any
harm
after
this
it
was
thought
necessary
to
make
an
effort
to
check
the
alligators
a
number
of
men
were
therefore
persuaded
to
sally
forth
in
their
montarias
and
devote
a
day
to
killing
them
the
young
men
made
several
hunting
excursions
during
the
fourteen
days
of
our
stay
on
catua
and
i
being
associated
with
them
in
all
their
pleasures
made
generally
one
of
the
party
these
were
besides
the
sole
occasions
on
which
i
could
add
to
my
collections
while
on
these
barren
sands
only
two
of
these
trips
afforded
incidents
worth
relating
the
first
which
was
made
to
the
interior
of
the
wooded
island
of
catua
was
not
a
very
successful
one
we
were
twelve
in
number
all
armed
with
guns
and
long
long
before
sunrise
my
friends
woke
me
up
from
my
hammock
where
i
lay
as
usual
in
the
clothes
worn
during
the
day
and
after
taking
each
a
of
cashaca
and
ginger
a
very
general
practice
in
early
morning
on
the
we
commenced
our
walk
the
waning
moon
still
lingered
in
the
clear
sky
and
a
profound
stillness
pervaded
sleeping
camp
forest
and
stream
along
the
line
of
ranchos
glimmered
the
fires
made
by
each
party
to
dry
for
food
the
eggs
being
spread
on
little
wooden
stages
over
the
smoke
the
distance
to
the
forest
from
our
place
of
starting
was
about
two
miles
being
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
which
was
also
a
very
broad
one
the
highest
part
where
it
was
covered
with
a
thicket
of
dwarf
willows
mimosas
and
arrow
grass
lying
near
the
ranchos
we
loitered
much
on
the
way
and
the
day
dawned
whilst
we
were
yet
on
the
road
the
sand
at
this
early
hour
feeling
quite
cold
to
the
naked
feet
as
soon
as
we
were
able
to
distinguish
things
the
surface
of
the
praia
was
seen
to
be
dotted
with
small
black
objects
these
were
hatched
aiyussa
turtles
which
were
making
their
way
in
an
undeviating
line
to
the
water
at
least
a
mile
distant
the
young
animal
of
this
species
is
distinguishable
from
that
of
the
large
turtle
and
the
tracaja
by
the
edges
of
the
being
raised
on
each
side
so
that
in
crawling
it
scores
two
parallel
lines
on
the
sand
the
mouths
of
these
little
creatures
were
full
of
sand
a
circumstance
arising
from
their
having
to
bite
their
way
through
many
inches
of
superincumbent
sand
to
reach
the
surface
on
emerging
from
the
buried
eggs
it
was
amusing
to
observe
how
constantly
they
turned
again
in
the
direction
of
the
distant
river
after
being
handled
and
set
down
on
the
sand
with
their
heads
facing
the
opposite
quarter
we
saw
also
several
skeletons
of
the
large
cayman
some
with
the
horny
and
bony
hide
of
the
animal
nearly
perfect
embedded
in
the
sand
they
reminded
me
of
the
remains
of
ichthyosauri
fossilised
in
beds
of
lias
with
the
difference
of
being
buried
in
fine
sand
instead
of
in
blue
mud
i
marked
the
place
of
one
which
had
a
skull
and
the
next
day
returned
to
secure
it
the
specimen
is
now
in
the
british
museum
collection
there
were
also
many
footmarks
of
jaguars
on
the
sand
we
entered
the
forest
as
the
sun
peeped
over
the
far
away
down
river
the
party
soon
after
divided
i
keeping
with
a
section
which
was
led
by
bento
the
ega
carpenter
a
capital
woodsman
after
a
short
walk
we
struck
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
little
lake
having
grassy
margins
and
clear
dark
water
on
the
surface
of
which
floated
thick
beds
of
we
then
crossed
a
muddy
creek
or
watercourse
that
entered
the
lake
and
then
found
ourselves
on
a
restinga
or
tongue
of
land
between
two
waters
by
keeping
in
sight
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
there
was
no
danger
of
our
losing
our
way
all
other
precautions
were
therefore
unnecessary
the
forest
was
tolerably
clear
of
underwood
and
consequently
easy
to
walk
through
we
had
not
gone
far
before
a
soft
whistle
was
heard
aloft
in
the
trees
betraying
the
presence
of
mutums
curassow
birds
the
crowns
of
the
trees
a
hundred
feet
or
more
over
our
heads
were
so
closely
interwoven
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
the
birds
the
practised
eye
of
bento
however
made
them
out
and
a
fine
male
was
shot
from
the
flock
the
rest
flying
away
and
alighting
at
no
great
distance
the
species
was
the
one
of
which
the
male
has
a
round
red
ball
on
its
beak
crax
globicera
the
pursuit
of
the
others
led
us
a
great
distance
straight
towards
the
interior
of
the
island
in
which
direction
we
marched
for
three
hours
having
the
lake
always
on
our
right
arriving
at
length
at
the
head
of
the
lake
bento
struck
off
to
the
left
across
the
restinga
and
we
then
soon
came
upon
a
treeless
space
choked
up
with
tall
grass
which
appeared
to
be
the
bed
of
another
lake
our
leader
was
obliged
to
climb
a
tree
to
ascertain
our
position
and
found
that
the
clear
space
was
part
of
the
creek
whose
mouth
we
had
crossed
lower
down
the
banks
were
clothed
with
low
trees
nearly
all
of
one
species
a
kind
of
araca
psidium
and
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
a
slender
delicate
grass
now
in
flower
a
great
number
of
crimson
and
butterflies
catagramma
peristera
male
and
female
were
settled
on
the
smooth
white
trunks
of
these
trees
i
had
also
here
the
great
pleasure
of
seeing
for
the
first
time
the
rare
and
curious
umbrella
bird
cephalopterus
ornatus
a
species
which
resembles
in
size
colour
and
appearance
our
common
crow
but
is
decorated
with
a
crest
of
long
curved
hairy
feathers
having
long
bare
quills
which
when
raised
spread
themselves
out
in
the
form
of
a
fringed
sunshade
over
the
head
a
strange
ornament
like
a
pelerine
is
also
suspended
from
the
neck
formed
by
a
thick
pad
of
glossy
feathers
which
grow
on
a
long
fleshy
lobe
or
excrescence
this
lobe
is
connected
as
i
found
on
skinning
specimens
with
an
unusual
development
of
the
trachea
and
vocal
organs
to
which
the
bird
doubtless
owes
its
singularly
deep
loud
and
fluty
note
the
indian
name
of
this
strange
creature
is
or
bird
mimbeu
is
the
indian
name
for
a
rude
kind
of
used
by
the
caishanas
and
other
tribes
in
allusion
to
the
tone
of
its
voice
we
had
the
good
luck
after
remaining
quiet
a
short
time
to
hear
its
performance
it
drew
itself
up
on
its
perch
spread
widely
the
crest
dilated
and
waved
its
glossy
and
then
in
giving
vent
to
its
loud
piping
note
bowed
its
head
slowly
forwards
we
obtained
a
pair
male
and
female
the
female
has
only
the
rudiments
of
the
crest
and
lappet
and
is
altogether
than
the
male
the
range
of
this
bird
appears
to
be
quite
confined
to
the
plains
of
the
upper
amazons
especially
the
ygapo
forests
not
having
been
found
to
the
east
of
the
rio
negro
bento
and
our
other
friends
being
disappointed
in
finding
no
more
curassows
or
indeed
any
other
species
of
game
now
resolved
to
turn
back
on
reaching
the
edge
of
the
forest
we
sat
down
and
ate
our
dinners
under
the
shade
each
man
having
brought
a
little
bag
containing
a
few
handsfull
of
farinha
and
a
piece
of
fried
fish
or
roast
turtle
we
expected
our
companions
of
the
other
division
to
join
us
at
midday
but
after
waiting
till
past
one
without
seeing
anything
of
them
in
fact
they
had
returned
to
the
huts
an
hour
or
two
previously
we
struck
off
across
the
praia
towards
the
encampment
an
obstacle
here
presented
itself
on
which
we
had
not
counted
the
sun
had
shone
all
day
through
a
cloudless
sky
untempered
by
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
sands
had
become
heated
by
it
to
a
degree
that
rendered
walking
over
them
with
our
bare
feet
impossible
the
most
hardened
footsoles
of
the
party
could
not
endure
the
burning
soil
we
made
several
attempts
we
tried
running
having
wrapped
the
cool
leaves
of
heliconiae
round
our
feet
but
in
no
way
could
we
step
forward
many
yards
there
was
no
means
of
getting
back
to
our
friends
before
night
except
going
round
the
praia
a
circuit
of
about
four
miles
and
walking
through
the
water
or
on
the
moist
sand
to
get
to
the
waterside
from
the
place
where
we
then
stood
was
not
difficult
as
a
thick
bed
of
a
flowering
shrub
called
tintarana
an
infusion
of
the
leaves
of
which
is
used
to
dye
black
lay
on
that
side
of
the
footsore
and
wearied
burthened
with
our
guns
and
walking
for
miles
through
the
tepid
shallow
water
under
the
vertical
sun
we
had
as
may
be
imagined
anything
but
a
pleasant
time
of
it
i
did
not
however
feel
any
inconvenience
afterwards
everyone
enjoys
the
most
lusty
health
while
living
this
free
and
wild
life
on
the
rivers
the
other
hunting
trip
which
i
have
alluded
to
was
undertaken
in
company
with
three
friendly
young
two
of
them
were
brothers
namely
joao
john
and
zephyrino
jabuti
jabuti
or
tortoise
being
a
nickname
which
their
father
had
earned
for
his
slow
gait
and
which
as
is
usual
in
this
country
had
descended
as
the
surname
of
the
family
the
other
was
jose
frazao
a
nephew
of
senor
chrysostomo
of
ega
an
active
clever
and
manly
young
fellow
whom
i
much
esteemed
he
was
almost
a
white
his
father
being
a
portuguese
and
his
mother
a
mameluca
we
were
accompanied
by
an
indian
named
lino
and
a
mulatto
boy
whose
office
was
to
carry
our
game
our
proposed
on
this
occasion
lay
across
the
water
about
fifteen
miles
distant
we
set
out
in
a
small
montaria
at
four
in
the
morning
again
leaving
the
encampment
asleep
and
travelled
at
a
good
pace
up
the
northern
channel
of
the
solimoens
or
that
lying
between
the
island
catua
and
the
left
bank
of
the
river
the
northern
shore
of
the
island
had
a
broad
sandy
beach
reaching
to
its
western
extremity
we
gained
our
destination
a
little
after
daybreak
this
was
the
banks
of
the
carapanatuba
meaning
in
tupi
the
river
of
many
mosquitoes
from
carapana
mosquito
and
ituba
many
a
channel
some
yards
in
width
which
like
the
anana
already
mentioned
communicates
with
the
cupiyo
to
reach
this
we
had
to
cross
the
river
here
nearly
two
miles
wide
just
as
day
dawned
we
saw
a
cayman
seize
a
large
fish
a
tambaki
near
the
surface
the
reptile
seemed
to
have
a
difficulty
in
securing
its
prey
for
it
reared
itself
above
the
water
tossing
the
fish
in
its
jaws
and
making
a
tremendous
commotion
i
was
much
struck
also
by
the
singular
appearance
presented
by
certain
diving
birds
having
very
long
and
snaky
necks
the
plotus
anhinga
occasionally
a
long
serpentine
form
would
suddenly
wriggle
itself
to
a
height
of
a
foot
and
a
half
above
the
glassy
surface
of
the
water
producing
such
a
deceptive
imitation
of
a
snake
that
at
first
i
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
it
to
be
the
neck
of
a
bird
it
did
not
remain
long
in
view
but
soon
plunged
again
beneath
the
stream
we
ran
ashore
in
a
most
lonely
and
gloomy
place
on
a
low
bank
covered
with
bushes
secured
the
montaria
to
a
tree
and
then
after
making
a
very
sparing
breakfast
on
fried
fish
and
mandioca
meal
rolled
up
our
trousers
and
plunged
into
the
thick
forest
which
here
as
everywhere
else
rose
like
a
lofty
wall
of
foliage
from
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
we
made
straight
for
the
heart
of
the
land
john
jabuti
leading
and
breaking
off
at
every
few
steps
a
branch
of
the
lower
trees
so
that
we
might
recognise
the
path
on
our
return
the
district
was
quite
new
to
all
my
companions
and
being
on
a
coast
almost
totally
uninhabited
by
human
beings
for
some
miles
to
lose
our
way
would
have
been
to
perish
helplessly
i
did
not
think
at
the
time
of
the
risk
we
ran
of
having
our
canoe
stolen
by
passing
indians
unguarded
montarias
being
never
safe
even
in
the
ports
of
the
villages
indians
apparently
considering
them
common
property
and
stealing
them
without
any
compunction
no
misgivings
clouded
the
lightness
of
heart
with
which
we
trod
forward
in
warm
anticipation
of
a
good
day
sport
the
tract
of
forest
through
which
we
passed
was
ygapo
but
the
higher
parts
of
the
land
formed
areas
which
went
only
a
very
few
inches
under
water
in
the
flood
season
it
consisted
of
a
most
bewildering
diversity
of
grand
and
beautiful
trees
draped
festooned
corded
matted
and
ribboned
with
climbing
plants
woody
and
succulent
in
endless
variety
the
most
prevalent
palm
was
the
tall
astryocaryum
jauari
whose
fallen
spines
made
it
necessary
to
pick
our
way
carefully
over
the
ground
as
we
were
all
barefooted
there
was
not
much
green
underwood
except
in
places
where
bamboos
grew
these
formed
impenetrable
thickets
of
plumy
foliage
and
thorny
jointed
stems
which
always
compelled
us
to
make
a
circuit
to
avoid
them
the
earth
elsewhere
was
encumbered
with
rotting
fruits
gigantic
leaves
limbs
and
trunks
of
trees
fixing
the
impression
of
its
being
the
cemetery
as
well
as
the
birthplace
of
the
great
world
of
vegetation
overhead
some
of
the
trees
were
of
prodigious
height
we
passed
many
specimens
of
the
moratinga
whose
cylindrical
trunks
i
dare
not
say
how
many
feet
in
circumference
towered
up
and
were
lost
amidst
the
crowns
of
the
lower
trees
their
lower
branches
in
some
cases
being
hidden
from
our
view
another
very
large
and
remarkable
tree
was
the
assacu
sapium
aucuparium
a
traveller
on
the
amazons
mingling
with
the
people
is
sure
to
hear
much
of
the
poisonous
qualities
of
the
juices
of
this
tree
its
bark
exudes
when
hacked
with
a
knife
a
milky
sap
which
is
not
only
a
fatal
poison
when
taken
internally
but
is
said
to
cause
incurable
sores
if
simply
sprinkled
on
the
skin
my
companions
always
gave
the
assacu
a
wide
berth
when
we
passed
one
the
tree
looks
ugly
enough
to
merit
a
bad
name
for
the
bark
is
of
a
dingy
olive
colour
and
is
studded
with
short
and
sharp
spines
after
walking
about
half
a
mile
we
came
upon
a
dry
watercourse
where
we
observed
first
the
old
footmarks
of
a
tapir
and
soon
after
on
the
margin
of
a
curious
circular
hole
full
of
muddy
water
the
fresh
tracks
of
a
jaguar
this
latter
discovery
was
hardly
made
when
a
rush
was
heard
amidst
the
bushes
on
the
top
of
a
sloping
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
dried
creek
we
bounded
forward
it
was
however
too
late
for
the
animal
had
sped
in
a
few
minutes
far
out
of
our
reach
it
was
clear
we
had
disturbed
on
our
approach
the
jaguar
while
quenching
his
thirst
at
the
a
few
steps
further
on
we
saw
the
mangled
remains
of
an
alligator
the
jacaretinga
the
head
forequarters
and
bony
shell
were
the
only
parts
which
remained
but
the
meat
was
quite
fresh
and
there
were
many
footmarks
of
the
jaguar
around
the
carcase
so
that
there
was
no
doubt
this
had
formed
the
solid
part
of
the
animal
breakfast
my
companions
now
began
to
search
for
the
alligator
nest
the
presence
of
the
reptile
so
far
from
the
river
being
accountable
for
on
no
other
ground
than
its
maternal
solicitude
for
its
eggs
we
found
in
fact
the
nest
at
the
distance
of
a
few
yards
from
the
place
it
was
a
conical
pile
of
dead
leaves
in
the
middle
of
which
twenty
eggs
were
buried
these
were
of
elliptical
shape
considerably
larger
than
those
of
a
duck
and
having
a
hard
shell
of
the
texture
of
porcelain
but
very
rough
on
the
outside
they
make
a
loud
sound
when
rubbed
together
and
it
is
said
that
it
is
easy
to
find
a
mother
alligator
in
the
ygapo
forests
by
rubbing
together
two
eggs
in
this
way
she
being
never
far
off
and
attracted
by
the
sounds
i
put
of
the
alligator
eggs
in
my
for
specimens
and
we
then
continued
on
our
way
lino
who
was
now
first
presently
made
a
start
backwards
calling
out
jararaca
this
is
the
name
of
a
poisonous
snake
genus
craspedocephalus
which
is
far
more
dreaded
by
the
natives
than
jaguar
or
alligator
the
individual
seen
by
lino
lay
coiled
up
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
was
scarcely
distinguishable
on
account
of
the
colours
of
its
body
being
assimilated
to
those
of
the
fallen
leaves
its
hideous
flat
triangular
head
connected
with
the
body
by
a
thin
neck
was
reared
and
turned
towards
us
frazao
killed
it
with
a
charge
of
shot
shattering
it
completely
and
destroying
to
my
regret
its
value
as
a
specimen
in
conversing
on
the
subject
of
jararacas
as
we
walked
onwards
every
one
of
the
party
was
ready
to
swear
that
this
snake
attacks
man
without
provocation
leaping
towards
him
from
a
considerable
distance
when
he
approaches
i
met
in
the
course
of
my
daily
rambles
in
the
woods
many
jararacas
and
once
or
twice
narrowly
very
escaped
treading
on
them
but
never
saw
them
attempt
to
spring
on
some
subjects
the
testimony
of
the
natives
of
a
wild
country
is
utterly
worthless
the
bite
of
the
jararacas
is
generally
fatal
i
knew
of
four
or
five
instances
of
death
from
it
and
only
of
one
clear
case
of
recovery
after
being
bitten
but
in
that
case
the
person
was
lamed
for
life
we
walked
over
moderately
elevated
and
dry
ground
for
about
a
mile
and
then
descended
three
or
four
feet
only
to
the
dry
bed
of
another
creek
this
was
pierced
in
the
same
way
as
the
former
with
round
holes
full
of
muddy
water
they
occurred
at
intervals
of
a
few
yards
and
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
made
by
the
hand
of
man
the
smallest
were
about
two
feet
the
largest
seven
or
eight
feet
in
diameter
as
we
approached
the
most
extensive
of
the
larger
ones
i
was
startled
at
seeing
a
number
of
large
heads
bobbing
about
the
surface
they
proved
to
be
those
of
electric
eels
and
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
the
round
holes
were
made
by
these
animals
working
constantly
round
and
round
in
the
moist
muddy
soil
their
depth
some
of
them
were
at
least
eight
feet
deep
was
doubtless
due
also
to
the
movements
of
the
eels
in
the
soft
soil
and
accounted
for
their
not
drying
up
in
the
fine
season
with
the
rest
of
the
creek
thus
while
alligators
and
turtles
in
this
great
inundated
forest
region
retire
to
the
larger
pools
during
the
dry
season
the
electric
eels
make
for
themselves
little
ponds
in
which
to
pass
the
season
of
drought
my
companions
now
cut
each
a
stout
pole
and
proceeded
to
eject
the
eels
in
order
to
get
at
the
other
fishes
with
which
they
had
discovered
the
ponds
to
abound
i
amused
them
all
very
much
by
showing
how
the
electric
shock
from
the
eels
could
pass
from
one
person
to
another
we
joined
hands
in
a
line
while
i
touched
the
biggest
and
freshest
of
the
animals
on
the
head
with
the
point
of
my
we
found
that
this
experiment
did
not
succeed
more
than
three
times
with
the
same
eel
when
out
of
the
water
for
the
fourth
time
the
shock
was
scarcely
perceptible
all
the
fishes
found
in
the
holes
besides
the
eels
belonged
to
one
species
a
small
kind
of
acari
or
loricaria
a
group
whose
members
have
a
complete
bony
integument
lino
and
the
boy
strung
them
together
through
the
gills
with
slender
sipos
and
hung
them
on
the
trees
to
await
our
return
later
in
the
day
leaving
the
bed
of
the
creek
we
marched
onwards
always
towards
the
centre
of
the
land
guided
by
the
sun
which
now
glimmered
through
the
thick
foliage
overhead
about
eleven
we
saw
a
break
in
the
forest
before
us
and
presently
emerged
on
the
banks
of
a
rather
large
sheet
of
water
this
was
one
of
the
interior
pools
of
which
there
are
so
many
in
this
district
the
margins
were
elevated
some
few
feet
and
sloped
down
to
the
water
the
ground
being
hard
and
dry
to
the
water
edge
and
covered
with
shrubby
vegetation
we
passed
completely
round
this
pool
finding
the
crowns
of
the
trees
on
its
borders
tenanted
by
curassow
birds
whose
presence
was
betrayed
as
usual
by
the
peculiar
note
which
they
emit
my
companions
shot
two
of
them
at
the
further
end
of
the
lake
lay
a
deep
watercourse
which
we
traced
for
about
half
a
mile
and
found
to
communicate
with
another
and
smaller
pool
this
second
one
evidently
swarmed
with
turtles
as
we
saw
the
snouts
of
many
peering
above
the
surface
of
the
water
the
same
had
not
been
seen
in
the
larger
lake
probably
because
we
had
made
too
much
noise
in
hailing
our
discovery
on
approaching
its
banks
my
friends
made
an
arrangement
on
the
spot
for
returning
to
this
pool
after
the
termination
of
the
egg
harvest
on
catua
in
recrossing
the
space
between
the
two
pools
we
heard
the
crash
of
monkeys
in
the
crowns
of
trees
overhead
the
chase
of
these
occupied
us
a
considerable
time
jose
fired
at
length
at
one
of
the
laggards
of
the
troop
and
wounded
him
he
climbed
pretty
nimbly
towards
a
denser
part
of
the
tree
and
a
second
and
third
discharge
failed
to
bring
him
down
the
poor
maimed
creature
then
trailed
his
limbs
to
one
of
the
topmost
branches
where
we
descried
him
soon
after
seated
and
picking
the
entrails
from
a
wound
in
his
abdomen
a
most
sight
the
height
from
the
ground
to
the
bough
on
which
he
was
perched
could
not
have
been
less
than
feet
and
we
could
get
a
glimpse
of
him
only
by
standing
directly
underneath
and
straining
our
eyes
upwards
we
killed
him
at
last
by
loading
our
best
gun
with
a
careful
charge
and
resting
the
barrel
against
the
treetrunk
to
steady
the
aim
a
few
shots
entered
his
chin
and
he
then
fell
heels
over
head
screaming
to
the
ground
although
it
was
i
who
gave
the
final
shot
this
animal
did
not
fall
to
my
lot
in
dividing
the
spoils
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
regret
now
not
having
preserved
the
skin
as
it
belonged
to
a
very
large
species
of
cebus
and
one
which
i
never
met
with
afterwards
it
was
about
one
in
the
afternoon
when
we
again
reached
the
spot
where
we
had
first
struck
the
banks
of
the
larger
pool
we
hitherto
had
but
poor
sport
so
after
dining
on
the
remains
of
our
fried
fish
and
farinha
and
smoking
our
cigarettes
the
apparatus
for
making
which
including
bamboo
and
steel
and
flint
for
striking
a
light
being
carried
by
every
one
always
on
these
expeditions
we
made
off
in
another
westerly
direction
through
the
forest
to
try
to
find
better
we
quenched
our
thirst
with
water
from
the
pool
which
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
quite
pure
these
pools
are
of
course
sometimes
fouled
for
a
time
by
the
movements
of
alligators
and
other
tenants
in
the
fine
mud
which
settles
at
the
bottom
but
i
never
observed
a
scum
of
confervae
or
traces
of
oil
revealing
animal
decomposition
on
the
surface
of
these
waters
nor
was
there
ever
any
foul
smell
perceptible
the
whole
of
this
level
land
instead
of
being
covered
with
unwholesome
swamps
emitting
malaria
forms
in
the
dry
season
and
in
the
wet
also
a
most
healthy
country
how
elaborate
must
be
the
natural
processes
of
in
these
teeming
waters
on
our
fresh
route
we
were
obliged
to
cut
our
way
through
a
long
belt
of
bamboo
underwood
and
not
being
so
careful
of
my
steps
as
my
companions
i
trod
repeatedly
on
the
flinty
thorns
which
had
fallen
from
the
bushes
finishing
by
becoming
completely
lame
one
thorn
having
entered
deeply
the
sole
of
my
foot
i
was
obliged
to
be
left
behind
lino
the
indian
remaining
with
me
the
careful
fellow
cleaned
my
wounds
with
his
saliva
placed
pieces
of
isca
the
substance
manufactured
by
ants
on
them
to
staunch
the
blood
and
bound
my
feet
with
tough
bast
to
serve
as
shoes
which
he
cut
from
the
bark
of
a
monguba
tree
he
went
about
his
work
in
a
very
gentle
way
and
with
much
skill
but
was
so
sparing
of
speech
that
i
could
scarcely
get
answers
to
the
questions
i
put
to
him
when
he
had
done
i
was
able
to
limp
about
pretty
nimbly
an
indian
when
he
performs
a
service
of
this
kind
never
thinks
of
a
reward
i
did
not
find
so
much
disinterestedness
in
negro
slaves
or
we
had
to
wait
two
hours
for
the
return
of
our
companions
during
part
of
this
time
i
was
left
quite
alone
lino
having
started
off
into
the
jungle
after
a
peccary
a
kind
of
wild
hog
which
had
come
near
to
where
we
sat
but
on
seeing
us
had
given
a
grunt
and
bounded
off
into
the
thickets
at
length
our
friends
hove
in
sight
loaded
with
game
having
shot
twelve
curassows
and
two
cujubims
penelope
pipile
a
handsome
black
fowl
with
a
white
head
which
is
arboreal
in
its
habits
like
the
rest
of
this
group
of
gallinaceous
birds
inhabiting
the
south
american
forests
they
had
discovered
a
third
pool
containing
plenty
of
turtles
lino
rejoined
us
at
the
same
time
having
missed
the
peccary
but
in
compensation
shot
a
quandu
or
porcupine
the
mulatto
boy
had
caught
alive
in
the
pool
a
most
charming
little
a
species
of
grebe
it
was
somewhat
smaller
than
a
pigeon
and
had
a
pointed
beak
its
feet
were
furnished
with
many
intricate
folds
or
frills
of
skin
instead
of
webs
and
resembled
very
much
those
of
the
gecko
lizards
the
bird
was
kept
as
a
pet
in
house
at
ega
for
a
long
time
afterwards
where
it
became
accustomed
to
swim
about
in
a
common
full
of
water
and
was
a
great
favourite
with
everybody
we
now
retraced
our
steps
towards
the
a
weary
walk
of
five
or
six
miles
reaching
our
canoe
by
five
or
a
little
before
sunset
it
was
considered
by
everyone
at
catua
that
we
had
had
an
unusually
good
day
sport
i
never
knew
any
small
party
to
take
so
much
game
in
one
day
in
these
forests
over
which
animals
are
everywhere
so
widely
and
sparingly
scattered
my
companions
were
greatly
elated
and
on
approaching
the
encampment
at
catua
made
a
great
commotion
with
their
paddles
to
announce
their
successful
return
singing
in
their
loudest
key
one
of
the
wild
choruses
of
the
amazonian
boatmen
the
excavation
of
eggs
and
preparation
of
the
oil
being
finished
we
left
catua
on
the
of
november
carepira
who
was
now
attached
to
cardozo
party
had
discovered
another
lake
rich
in
turtles
about
twelve
miles
distant
in
one
of
his
fishing
rambles
and
my
friend
resolved
before
returning
to
ega
to
go
there
with
his
nets
and
drag
it
as
we
had
formerly
done
the
aningal
several
mameluco
families
of
ega
begged
to
accompany
us
to
share
the
labours
and
booty
the
shumana
family
also
joined
the
party
we
therefore
formed
a
large
body
numbering
in
all
eight
canoes
and
fifty
persons
the
summer
season
was
now
breaking
up
the
river
was
rising
the
sky
was
almost
constantly
clouded
and
we
had
frequent
rains
the
mosquitoes
also
which
we
had
not
felt
while
encamped
on
the
now
became
troublesome
we
paddled
up
the
westerly
channel
and
arrived
at
a
point
near
the
upper
end
of
catua
at
ten
there
was
here
a
very
broad
beach
of
untrodden
white
sand
which
extended
quite
into
the
forest
where
it
formed
rounded
hills
and
hollows
like
sand
dunes
covered
with
a
peculiar
vegetation
harsh
reedy
grasses
and
low
trees
matted
together
with
lianas
and
varied
with
dwarf
spiny
palms
of
the
genus
bactris
we
encamped
for
the
night
on
the
sands
finding
the
place
luckily
free
from
mosquitoes
the
different
portions
of
the
party
made
arched
coverings
with
the
toldos
or
awnings
of
their
canoes
to
sleep
under
fixing
the
edges
in
the
sand
no
one
however
seemed
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
so
after
supper
we
all
sat
or
lay
around
the
large
fires
and
amused
ourselves
we
had
the
fiddler
with
us
and
in
the
intervals
between
the
wretched
tunes
which
he
played
the
usual
amusement
of
beguiled
the
time
tales
of
escapes
from
jaguar
alligator
and
so
forth
there
were
amongst
us
a
father
and
son
who
had
been
the
actors
the
previous
year
in
an
alligator
adventure
on
the
edge
of
the
praia
we
had
just
left
the
son
while
bathing
was
seized
by
the
thigh
and
carried
under
water
a
cry
was
raised
and
the
father
rushing
down
the
bank
plunged
after
the
rapacious
beast
which
was
diving
away
with
his
victim
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
a
man
could
overtake
and
master
the
large
cayman
in
his
own
element
but
such
was
the
case
in
this
instance
for
the
animal
was
reached
and
forced
to
release
his
booty
by
the
man
thrusting
his
thumb
into
his
eye
the
lad
showed
us
the
marks
of
the
alligator
teeth
on
his
thigh
we
sat
up
until
past
midnight
listening
to
these
stories
and
assisting
the
flow
of
talk
by
frequent
potations
of
burnt
rum
a
large
shallow
dish
was
filled
with
the
liquor
and
fired
when
it
had
burned
for
a
few
minutes
the
flame
was
extinguished
and
each
one
helped
himself
by
dipping
a
into
the
vessel
one
by
one
the
people
dropped
asleep
and
then
the
quiet
murmur
of
talk
of
the
few
who
remained
awake
was
interrupted
by
the
roar
of
jaguars
in
the
jungle
about
a
furlong
distant
there
was
not
one
only
but
several
of
the
animals
the
older
men
showed
considerable
alarm
and
proceeded
to
light
fresh
fires
around
the
outside
of
our
encampment
i
had
read
in
books
of
travel
of
tigers
coming
to
warm
themselves
by
the
fires
of
a
bivouac
and
thought
my
strong
wish
to
witness
the
same
sight
would
have
been
gratified
tonight
i
had
not
however
such
good
fortune
although
i
was
the
last
to
go
to
sleep
and
my
bed
was
the
bare
sand
under
a
little
arched
covering
open
at
both
ends
the
jaguars
nevertheless
must
have
come
very
near
during
the
night
for
their
fresh
footmarks
were
numerous
within
a
score
yards
of
the
place
where
we
slept
in
the
morning
i
had
a
ramble
along
the
borders
of
the
jungle
and
found
the
tracks
very
numerous
and
close
together
on
the
sandy
soil
we
remained
in
this
neighbourhood
four
days
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
many
hundred
turtles
but
we
were
obliged
to
sleep
two
nights
within
the
carapanatuba
channel
the
first
night
passed
rather
pleasantly
for
the
weather
was
fine
and
we
encamped
in
the
forest
making
large
fires
and
slinging
our
hammocks
between
the
trees
the
second
was
one
of
the
most
miserable
nights
i
ever
spent
the
air
was
close
and
a
drizzling
rain
began
to
fall
about
midnight
lasting
until
morning
we
tried
at
first
to
brave
it
out
under
the
trees
several
very
large
fires
were
made
lighting
up
with
ruddy
gleams
the
magnificent
foliage
in
the
black
shades
around
our
encampment
the
heat
and
smoke
had
the
desired
effect
of
keeping
off
pretty
well
the
mosquitoes
but
the
rain
continued
until
at
length
everything
was
soaked
and
we
had
no
help
for
it
but
to
bundle
off
to
the
canoes
with
drenched
hammocks
and
garments
there
was
not
nearly
room
enough
in
the
flotilla
to
accommodate
so
large
a
number
of
persons
lying
at
full
length
moreover
the
night
was
pitch
dark
and
it
was
quite
impossible
in
the
gloom
and
confusion
to
get
at
a
change
of
clothing
so
there
we
lay
huddled
together
in
the
best
way
we
could
arrange
ourselves
exhausted
with
fatigue
and
irritated
beyond
all
conception
by
clouds
of
mosquitoes
i
slept
on
a
bench
with
a
sail
over
me
my
wet
clothes
clinging
to
my
body
and
to
increase
my
discomfort
close
beside
me
lay
an
indian
girl
one
of
cardozo
domestics
who
had
a
skin
disfigured
with
black
diseased
patches
and
whose
thick
clothing
not
having
been
washed
during
the
whole
time
we
had
been
out
eighteen
days
gave
forth
a
most
vile
effluvium
we
spent
the
night
of
the
of
november
pleasantly
on
the
smooth
sands
where
the
jaguars
again
serenaded
us
and
on
the
succeeding
morning
we
commenced
our
return
voyage
to
ega
we
first
doubled
the
upper
end
of
the
island
of
catua
and
then
struck
off
for
the
right
bank
of
the
solimoens
the
river
was
here
of
immense
width
and
the
current
was
so
strong
in
the
middle
that
it
required
the
most
strenuous
exertions
on
the
part
of
our
paddlers
to
prevent
us
from
being
carried
miles
away
down
the
stream
at
night
we
reached
the
juteca
a
small
river
which
enters
the
solimoens
by
a
channel
so
narrow
that
a
man
might
almost
jump
across
it
but
a
furlong
inwards
expands
into
a
very
pretty
lake
several
miles
in
circumference
we
slept
again
in
the
forest
and
again
were
annoyed
by
rain
and
mosquitoes
but
this
time
cardozo
and
i
preferred
remaining
where
we
were
to
mingling
with
the
reeking
crowd
in
the
boats
when
the
grey
dawn
arose
a
steady
rain
was
still
falling
and
the
whole
sky
had
a
settled
leaden
appearance
but
it
was
delightfully
cool
we
took
our
net
into
the
lake
and
gleaned
a
good
supply
of
delicious
fish
for
breakfast
i
saw
at
the
upper
end
of
this
lake
the
native
rice
of
this
country
growing
wild
the
weather
cleared
up
at
ten
at
three
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
cayambe
another
tributary
stream
much
larger
than
the
juteca
the
channel
of
exit
to
the
solimoens
was
here
also
very
narrow
but
the
expanded
river
inside
is
of
vast
dimensions
it
forms
a
lake
i
may
safely
venture
to
say
several
score
miles
in
circumference
although
prepared
for
these
surprises
i
was
quite
taken
aback
in
this
case
we
had
been
paddling
all
day
along
a
monotonous
shore
with
the
dreary
solimoens
before
us
here
three
to
four
miles
broad
heavily
rolling
onward
its
muddy
waters
we
come
to
a
little
gap
in
the
earthy
banks
and
find
a
dark
narrow
inlet
with
a
wall
of
forest
overshadowing
it
on
each
side
we
enter
it
and
at
a
distance
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
a
glorious
sheet
of
water
bursts
upon
the
view
the
scenery
of
cayambe
is
very
picturesque
the
land
on
the
two
sides
visible
of
the
lake
is
high
and
clothed
with
sombre
woods
varied
here
and
there
with
a
house
in
the
middle
of
a
green
patch
of
clearing
belonging
to
settlers
in
striking
contrast
to
these
dark
rolling
forests
is
the
vivid
light
green
and
cheerful
foliage
of
the
woods
on
the
numerous
islets
which
rest
like
on
the
surface
of
the
lake
flocks
of
ducks
storks
and
herons
inhabit
these
islets
and
a
noise
of
parrots
with
the
tingling
chorus
of
was
heard
from
them
as
we
passed
this
has
a
cheering
effect
after
the
depressing
stillness
and
absence
of
life
in
the
woods
on
the
margins
of
the
main
river
cardozo
and
i
took
a
small
boat
and
crossed
the
lake
to
visit
one
of
the
settlers
and
on
our
return
to
our
canoe
while
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
a
squall
suddenly
arose
in
the
direction
towards
which
we
were
going
so
that
for
a
whole
hour
we
were
in
great
danger
of
being
swamped
the
wind
blew
away
the
awning
and
mats
and
lashed
the
waters
into
foam
the
waves
rising
to
a
great
height
our
boat
fortunately
was
excellently
constructed
rising
well
towards
the
prow
so
that
with
good
steering
we
managed
to
head
the
billows
as
they
arose
and
escaped
without
shipping
much
water
we
reached
our
igarite
at
sunset
and
then
made
all
speed
to
curubaru
fifteen
miles
distant
to
encamp
for
the
night
on
the
sands
we
reached
the
praia
at
ten
the
waters
were
now
mounting
fast
upon
the
sloping
beach
and
we
found
on
dragging
the
net
next
morning
that
fish
was
beginning
to
be
scarce
cardozo
and
his
friends
talked
quite
gloomily
at
breakfast
time
over
the
departure
of
the
joyous
verao
and
the
setting
in
of
the
dull
hungry
winter
season
at
nine
in
the
morning
of
the
of
november
a
light
wind
from
down
river
sprang
up
and
all
who
had
sails
hoisted
them
it
was
the
first
time
during
our
trip
that
we
had
had
occasion
to
use
our
sails
so
continual
is
the
calm
on
this
upper
river
we
bowled
along
merrily
and
soon
entered
the
broad
channel
lying
between
baria
and
the
mainland
on
the
south
bank
the
wind
carried
us
right
into
the
mouth
of
the
teffe
and
at
four
we
cast

very

of
the
animal
tenants
of
this

the
collections
that
i
had
the
opportunity
of
making
and
sending
home
attracted
therefore
considerable
attention
indeed
the
name
of
my
favourite
village
has
become
quite
a
household
word
among
a
numerous
class
of
naturalists
not
only
in
england
but
abroad
in
consequence
of
the
very
large
number
of
new
species
upwards
of
which
they
have
had
to
describe
with
the
locality
ega
attached
to
them
the
discovery
of
new
species
however
forms
but
a
small
item
in
the
interest
belonging
to
the
study
of
the
living
creation
the
structure
habits
instincts
and
geographical
distribution
of
some
of
the
forms
supply
inexhaustible
materials
for
reflection
the
few
remarks
i
have
to
make
on
the
animals
of
ega
will
relate
to
the
mammals
birds
and
insects
and
will
sometimes
apply
to
the
productions
of
the
whole
upper
amazons
region
we
will
begin
with
the
monkeys
the
most
interesting
next
to
man
of
all
animals
monkeys
early
one
sunny
morning
in
the
year
i
saw
in
the
streets
of
ega
a
number
of
indians
carrying
on
their
shoulders
down
to
the
port
to
be
embarked
on
the
upper
amazons
steamer
a
large
cage
made
of
strong
lianas
some
twelve
feet
in
length
and
five
in
height
containing
a
dozen
monkeys
of
the
most
grotesque
appearance
their
bodies
about
eighteen
inches
in
height
exclusive
of
limbs
were
clothed
from
neck
to
tail
with
very
long
straight
and
shining
whitish
hair
their
heads
were
nearly
bald
owing
to
the
very
short
crop
of
thin
grey
hairs
and
their
faces
glowed
with
the
most
vivid
scarlet
hue
as
a
finish
to
their
striking
physiognomy
they
had
bushy
whiskers
of
a
sandy
colour
meeting
under
the
chin
and
eyes
these
apes
belonged
to
a
species
called
by
the
indians
uakari
which
is
peculiar
to
the
ega
district
and
the
cage
with
its
contents
was
being
sent
as
a
present
by
senor
chrysostomo
the
director
of
indians
of
the
japura
to
one
of
the
government
officials
at
rio
janeiro
in
acknowledgment
of
having
been
made
colonel
of
the
new
national
guard
they
had
been
obtained
with
great
difficulty
in
the
forests
which
cover
the
lowlands
near
the
principal
mouth
of
the
japura
about
thirty
miles
from
ega
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
this
most
curious
of
all
the
south
american
monkeys
and
one
that
appears
to
have
escaped
the
notice
of
spix
and
martius
i
afterwards
made
a
journey
to
the
district
inhabited
by
it
but
did
not
then
succeed
in
obtaining
specimens
before
leaving
the
country
however
i
acquired
two
individuals
one
of
which
lived
in
my
house
for
several
weeks
the
monkey
belongs
in
all
essential
points
of
structure
to
the
same
family
cebidae
as
the
rest
of
the
sized
american
species
but
it
differs
from
all
its
relatives
in
having
only
the
rudiment
of
a
tail
a
member
which
reaches
in
some
allied
kinds
the
highest
grade
of
development
known
in
the
order
it
was
so
unusual
to
see
a
nearly
tailless
monkey
from
america
that
naturalists
thought
when
the
first
specimens
arrived
in
europe
that
the
member
had
been
shortened
artificially
nevertheless
the
uakari
is
not
quite
isolated
from
its
related
species
of
the
same
family
several
other
kinds
also
found
on
the
amazons
forming
a
graduated
passage
between
the
extreme
forms
as
regards
the
tail
the
appendage
reaches
its
perfection
in
those
genera
the
howlers
the
lagothrix
and
the
spider
monkeys
in
which
it
presents
on
its
near
the
tip
a
naked
palm
which
makes
it
sensitive
and
useful
as
a
fifth
hand
in
climbing
in
the
rest
of
the
genera
of
cebidae
seven
in
number
containing
species
the
tail
is
weaker
in
structure
entirely
covered
with
hair
and
of
little
or
no
service
in
climbing
a
few
species
nearly
related
to
our
uakari
having
it
much
shorter
than
usual
all
the
cebidae
both
and
are
equally
dwellers
in
trees
the
monkey
lives
in
forests
which
are
inundated
during
great
part
of
the
year
and
is
never
known
to
descend
to
the
ground
the
shortness
of
its
tail
is
therefore
no
sign
of
terrestrial
habits
as
it
is
in
the
macaques
and
baboons
of
the
old
world
it
differs
a
little
from
the
typical
cebidae
in
its
teeth
the
incisors
being
oblique
and
in
the
upper
jaw
converging
so
as
to
leave
a
gap
between
the
outermost
and
the
canine
teeth
like
all
the
rest
of
its
family
it
differs
from
the
monkeys
of
the
old
world
and
from
man
in
having
an
additional
premolar
in
each
side
of
both
jaws
making
the
complete
set
instead
of
in
number
the
white
uakari
brachyurus
calvus
seems
to
be
found
in
no
other
part
of
america
than
the
district
just
mentioned
namely
the
banks
of
the
japura
near
its
principal
mouth
and
even
there
it
is
confined
as
far
i
could
learn
to
the
western
side
of
the
river
it
lives
in
small
troops
among
the
crowns
of
the
lofty
trees
subsisting
on
fruits
of
various
kinds
hunters
say
it
is
pretty
nimble
in
its
motions
but
is
not
much
given
to
leaping
preferring
to
run
up
and
down
the
larger
boughs
in
travelling
from
tree
to
tree
the
mother
as
in
other
species
of
the
monkey
order
carries
her
young
on
her
back
individuals
are
obtained
alive
by
shooting
them
with
the
and
arrows
tipped
with
diluted
urari
poison
they
run
a
considerable
distance
after
being
pierced
and
it
requires
an
experienced
hunter
to
track
them
he
is
considered
the
most
expert
who
can
keep
pace
with
a
wounded
one
and
catch
it
in
his
arms
when
it
falls
exhausted
a
pinch
of
salt
the
antidote
to
the
poison
is
then
put
in
its
mouth
and
the
creature
revives
the
species
is
rare
even
in
the
limited
district
which
it
inhabits
senor
chrysostomo
sent
six
of
his
most
skillful
indians
who
were
absent
three
weeks
before
they
obtained
the
twelve
specimens
which
formed
his
unique
and
princely
gift
when
an
independent
hunter
obtains
one
a
very
high
price
thirty
to
forty
milreis
three
pounds
seven
shillings
to
four
pounds
thirteen
shillings
is
asked
these
monkeys
being
in
great
demand
for
presents
to
persons
of
influence
down
the
river
adult
uakaris
caught
in
the
way
just
described
very
rarely
become
tame
they
are
peevish
and
sulky
resisting
all
attempts
to
coax
them
and
biting
anyone
who
ventures
within
reach
they
have
no
particular
cry
even
when
in
their
native
woods
in
captivity
they
are
quite
silent
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
or
weeks
if
not
very
carefully
attended
to
they
fall
into
a
listless
condition
refuse
food
and
die
many
of
them
succumb
to
a
disease
which
i
suppose
from
the
symptoms
to
be
inflammation
of
the
chest
or
lungs
the
one
which
i
kept
as
a
pet
died
of
this
disorder
after
i
had
had
it
about
three
weeks
it
lost
its
appetite
in
a
very
few
days
although
kept
in
an
airy
verandah
its
coat
which
was
originally
long
smooth
and
glossy
became
dingy
and
ragged
like
that
of
the
specimens
seen
in
museums
and
the
bright
scarlet
colour
of
its
face
changed
to
a
duller
hue
this
colour
in
health
is
spread
over
the
features
up
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
on
the
forehead
and
temples
and
down
to
the
neck
including
the
flabby
cheeks
which
hang
down
below
the
jaws
the
animal
in
this
condition
looks
at
a
short
distance
as
though
some
one
had
laid
a
thick
coat
of
red
paint
on
its
countenance
the
death
of
my
pet
was
slow
during
the
last
hours
it
lay
prostrate
breathing
quickly
its
chest
strongly
heaving
the
colour
of
its
face
became
gradually
paler
but
was
still
red
when
it
expired
as
the
hue
did
not
quite
disappear
until
two
or
three
hours
after
the
animal
was
quite
dead
i
judged
that
it
was
not
exclusively
due
to
the
blood
but
partly
to
a
pigment
beneath
the
skin
which
would
probably
retain
its
colour
a
short
time
after
the
circulation
had
ceased
after
seeing
much
of
the
morose
disposition
of
the
uakari
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
one
day
at
a
friend
house
to
find
an
extremely
lively
and
familiar
individual
of
this
species
it
ran
from
an
inner
chamber
straight
towards
me
after
i
had
sat
down
on
a
chair
climbed
my
legs
and
nestled
in
my
lap
turning
round
and
looking
up
with
the
usual
monkey
grin
after
it
had
made
itself
comfortable
it
was
a
young
animal
which
had
been
taken
when
its
mother
was
shot
with
a
poisoned
arrow
its
teeth
were
incomplete
and
the
face
was
pale
and
mottled
the
glowing
scarlet
hue
not
supervening
in
these
animals
before
mature
age
it
had
also
a
few
long
black
hairs
on
the
eyebrows
and
lips
the
frisky
little
fellow
had
been
reared
in
the
house
amongst
the
children
and
allowed
to
run
about
freely
and
take
its
meals
with
the
rest
of
the
household
there
are
few
animals
which
the
brazilians
of
these
villages
have
not
succeeded
in
taming
i
have
even
seen
young
jaguars
running
loose
about
a
house
and
treated
as
pets
the
animals
that
i
had
rarely
became
familiar
however
long
they
might
remain
in
my
possession
a
circumstance
due
no
doubt
to
their
being
kept
always
tied
up
the
uakari
is
one
of
the
many
species
of
animals
which
are
classified
by
the
brazilians
as
mortal
or
of
delicate
constitution
in
contradistinction
to
those
which
are
duro
or
hardy
a
large
proportion
of
the
specimens
sent
from
ega
die
before
arriving
at
para
and
scarcely
one
in
a
dozen
succeeds
in
reaching
rip
janeiro
alive
the
difficulty
it
has
of
accommodating
itself
to
changed
conditions
probably
has
some
connection
with
the
very
limited
range
or
confined
sphere
of
life
of
the
species
in
its
natural
state
its
native
home
being
an
area
of
swampy
woods
not
more
than
about
sixty
square
miles
in
extent
although
no
permanent
barrier
exists
to
cheek
its
dispersal
except
towards
the
south
over
a
much
wider
space
when
i
descended
the
river
in
we
had
with
us
a
tame
adult
uakari
which
was
allowed
to
ramble
about
the
vessel
a
large
schooner
when
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
rio
negro
we
had
to
wait
four
days
while
the
officials
at
barra
ten
miles
distant
made
out
the
passports
for
our
crew
and
during
this
time
the
schooner
lay
close
to
the
shore
with
its
bowsprit
secured
to
the
trees
on
the
bank
well
one
morning
was
missing
having
made
his
escape
into
the
forest
two
men
were
sent
in
search
of
him
but
returned
after
several
hours
absence
without
having
caught
sight
of
the
runaway
we
gave
up
the
monkey
for
lost
until
the
following
day
when
he
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
and
marched
quietly
down
the
bowsprit
to
his
usual
place
on
deck
he
had
evidently
found
the
forests
of
the
rio
negro
very
different
from
those
of
the
delta
lands
of
the
japura
and
preferred
captivity
to
freedom
in
a
place
that
was
so
uncongenial
to
him
the
parauacu
another
ega
monkey
nearly
related
to
the
uakaris
is
the
parauacu
pithecia
hirsuta
a
timid
inoffensive
creature
with
a
long
coat
of
harsh
hair
the
long
fur
hangs
over
the
head
half
concealing
the
pleasing
diminutive
face
and
clothes
also
the
tail
to
the
tip
which
member
is
well
developed
being
eighteen
inches
in
length
or
longer
than
the
body
the
parauacu
is
found
on
the
terra
firma
lands
of
the
north
shore
of
the
solimoens
from
tunantins
to
peru
it
exists
also
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
namely
on
the
banks
of
the
teffe
but
there
under
a
changed
form
which
differs
a
little
from
its
type
in
colours
this
form
has
been
described
by
gray
as
a
distinct
species
under
the
name
of
pithecia
albicans
the
parauacu
is
also
a
very
delicate
animal
rarely
living
many
weeks
in
captivity
but
any
one
who
succeeds
in
keeping
it
alive
for
a
month
or
two
gains
by
it
a
most
affectionate
pet
one
of
the
specimens
of
pithecia
albicans
now
in
the
british
museum
was
when
living
the
property
of
a
young
frenchman
a
neighbour
of
mine
at
ega
it
became
so
tame
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
that
it
followed
him
about
the
streets
like
a
dog
my
friend
was
a
tailor
and
the
little
pet
used
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
seated
on
his
shoulder
while
he
was
at
work
on
his
board
nevertheless
it
showed
great
dislike
to
strangers
and
was
not
on
good
terms
with
any
other
member
of
my
friend
household
than
himself
i
saw
no
monkey
that
showed
so
strong
a
personal
attachment
as
this
gentle
timid
silent
little
creature
the
eager
and
passionate
cebi
seem
to
take
the
lead
of
all
the
south
american
monkeys
in
intelligence
and
docility
and
the
coaita
has
perhaps
the
most
gentle
and
impressible
disposition
but
the
parauacu
although
a
dull
cheerless
animal
excels
all
in
this
quality
of
capability
of
attachment
to
individuals
of
our
own
species
it
is
not
wanting
however
in
intelligence
as
well
as
moral
goodness
proof
of
which
was
furnished
one
day
by
an
act
of
our
little
pet
my
neighbour
had
quitted
his
house
in
the
morning
without
taking
parauacu
with
him
and
the
little
creature
having
missed
its
friend
and
concluded
as
it
seemed
that
he
would
be
sure
to
come
to
me
both
being
in
the
habit
of
paying
me
a
daily
visit
together
came
straight
to
my
dwelling
taking
a
short
cut
over
gardens
trees
and
thickets
instead
of
going
the
roundabout
way
of
the
street
it
had
never
done
this
before
and
we
knew
the
route
it
had
taken
only
from
a
neighbour
having
watched
its
movements
on
arriving
at
my
house
and
not
finding
its
master
it
climbed
to
the
top
of
my
table
and
sat
with
an
air
of
quiet
resignation
waiting
for
him
shortly
afterwards
my
friend
entered
and
the
gladdened
pet
then
jumped
to
its
usual
perch
on
his
shoulder
night
apes
a
third
interesting
genus
of
monkeys
found
near
ega
are
the
nyctipitheci
or
night
apes
called
by
the
indians
of
these
i
found
two
species
closely
related
to
each
other
but
nevertheless
quite
distinct
as
both
inhabit
the
same
forests
namely
those
of
the
higher
and
drier
lands
without
mingling
with
each
other
or
intercrossing
they
sleep
all
day
long
in
hollow
trees
and
come
forth
to
prey
on
insects
and
eat
fruits
only
in
the
night
they
are
of
small
size
the
body
being
about
a
foot
long
and
the
tall
fourteen
inches
and
are
thickly
clothed
with
soft
grey
and
brown
fur
similar
in
substance
to
that
of
the
rabbit
their
physiognomy
reminds
one
of
an
owl
or
the
face
is
round
and
encircled
by
a
ruff
of
whitish
fur
the
muzzle
is
not
at
all
prominent
the
mouth
and
chin
are
small
the
cars
are
very
short
scarcely
appearing
above
the
hair
of
the
head
and
the
eyes
are
large
and
yellowish
in
colour
imparting
the
staring
expression
of
nocturnal
animals
of
prey
the
forehead
is
whitish
and
decorated
with
three
black
stripes
which
in
one
of
the
species
nyctipithecus
trivirgatus
continue
to
the
crown
and
in
the
other
felinus
meet
on
the
top
of
the
forehead
trivirgatus
was
first
described
by
humboldt
who
discovered
it
on
the
banks
of
the
cassiquiare
near
the
head
waters
of
the
rio
negro
i
kept
a
pet
animal
of
the
trivirgatus
for
many
months
a
young
one
having
been
given
to
me
by
an
indian
compadre
as
a
present
from
my
godson
these
monkeys
although
sleeping
by
day
are
aroused
by
the
least
noise
so
that
when
a
person
passes
by
a
tree
in
which
a
number
of
them
are
concealed
he
is
startled
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
group
of
little
striped
faces
crowding
a
hole
in
the
trunk
it
was
in
this
way
that
my
compadre
discovered
the
colony
from
which
the
one
given
to
me
was
taken
i
was
obliged
to
keep
my
pet
chained
up
it
therefore
never
became
thoroughly
familiar
i
once
saw
however
an
individual
of
the
other
species
felinus
which
was
most
amusingly
tame
it
was
as
lively
and
nimble
as
the
cebi
but
not
so
mischievous
and
far
more
confiding
in
its
disposition
delighting
to
be
caressed
by
all
persons
who
came
into
the
house
but
its
owner
the
municipal
judge
of
ega
carlos
mariana
had
treated
it
for
many
weeks
with
the
greatest
kindness
allowing
it
to
sleep
with
him
at
night
in
his
hammock
and
to
nestle
in
his
bosom
half
the
day
as
he
lay
reading
it
was
a
great
favourite
with
everyone
from
the
cleanliness
of
its
habits
to
the
prettiness
of
its
features
and
ways
my
own
pet
was
kept
in
a
box
in
which
was
placed
a
glass
jar
into
this
it
would
dive
head
foremost
when
any
one
entered
the
room
turning
round
inside
and
thrusting
forth
its
inquisitive
face
an
instant
afterwards
to
stare
at
the
intruder
it
was
very
active
at
night
venting
at
frequent
intervals
a
hoarse
cry
like
the
suppressed
barking
of
a
dog
and
scampering
about
the
room
to
the
length
of
its
tether
after
cockroaches
and
spiders
in
climbing
between
the
box
and
the
wall
it
straddled
the
space
resting
its
hands
on
the
palms
and
tips
of
the
fingers
with
the
knuckles
bent
at
an
acute
angle
and
thus
mounted
to
the
top
with
the
greatest
facility
although
seeming
to
prefer
insects
it
ate
all
kinds
of
fruit
but
would
not
touch
raw
or
cooked
meat
and
was
very
seldom
thirsty
i
was
told
by
persons
who
had
kept
these
monkeys
loose
about
the
house
that
they
cleared
the
chambers
of
bats
as
well
as
insect
vermin
when
approached
gently
my
allowed
itself
to
be
caressed
but
when
handled
roughly
it
always
took
alarm
biting
severely
striking
out
its
little
hands
and
making
a
hissing
noise
like
a
cat
as
already
related
my
pet
was
killed
by
a
jealous
caiarara
monkey
which
was
kept
in
the
house
at
the
same
time
barrigudo
ten
other
species
of
monkeys
were
found
in
addition
to
those
already
mentioned
in
the
forests
of
the
upper
amazons
all
were
strictly
arboreal
and
diurnal
in
their
habits
and
lived
in
flocks
travelling
from
tree
to
tree
the
mothers
with
their
children
on
their
backs
leading
in
fact
a
life
similar
to
that
of
the
pararauate
indians
and
like
them
occasionally
plundering
the
plantations
which
lie
near
their
line
of
march
some
of
them
were
found
also
on
the
lower
amazons
and
have
been
noticed
in
former
chapters
of
this
narrative
of
the
remainder
the
most
remarkable
is
the
macaco
barrigudo
or
bellied
monkey
of
the
portuguese
colonists
a
species
of
lagothrix
the
genus
is
closely
allied
to
the
coaitas
or
spider
monkeys
having
like
them
exceedingly
strong
and
flexible
tails
which
are
furnished
underneath
with
a
naked
palm
like
a
hand
for
grasping
the
barrigudos
however
are
very
bulky
animals
while
the
spider
monkeys
are
remarkable
for
the
slenderness
of
their
bodies
and
limbs
i
obtained
specimens
of
what
have
been
considered
two
species
one
olivaceus
of
spix
having
the
head
clothed
with
grey
the
other
humboldtii
with
black
fur
they
both
live
together
in
the
same
places
and
are
probably
only
individuals
of
one
and
the
same
species
i
sent
home
a
very
large
male
of
one
of
these
kinds
which
measured
inches
in
length
of
trunk
the
tail
being
inches
long
it
was
the
largest
monkey
i
saw
in
america
with
the
exception
of
a
black
howler
whose
body
was
inches
in
height
the
skin
of
the
face
in
the
barrigudo
is
black
and
wrinkled
the
forehead
is
low
with
the
eyebrows
projecting
and
in
short
the
features
altogether
resemble
in
a
striking
manner
those
of
an
old
negro
in
the
forests
the
barrigudo
is
not
a
very
active
animal
it
lives
exclusively
on
fruits
and
is
much
persecuted
by
the
indians
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
its
flesh
as
food
from
information
given
me
by
a
collector
of
birds
and
mammals
whom
i
employed
and
who
resided
a
long
time
among
the
tucuna
indians
near
tabatinga
i
calculated
that
one
horde
of
this
tribe
in
number
destroyed
of
these
monkeys
annually
for
food
the
species
is
very
numerous
in
the
forests
of
the
higher
lands
but
owing
to
long
persecution
it
is
now
seldom
seen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
larger
villages
it
is
not
found
at
all
on
the
lower
amazons
its
manners
in
captivity
are
grave
and
its
temper
mild
and
confiding
like
that
of
the
coaitas
owing
to
these
traits
the
barrigudo
is
much
sought
after
for
pets
but
it
is
not
hardy
like
the
coaitas
and
seldom
survives
a
passage
down
the
river
to
para
now
only
remains
to
notice
the
marmosets
which
form
the
second
family
of
american
monkeys
our
old
friend
midas
ursulus
of
para
and
the
lower
amazons
is
not
found
on
the
upper
river
but
in
its
stead
a
species
presents
itself
which
appears
to
be
the
midas
rufoniger
of
gervais
whose
mouth
is
bordered
with
longish
white
hairs
the
habits
of
this
species
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
ursulus
indeed
it
seems
probable
that
it
is
a
form
or
race
of
the
same
stock
modified
to
suit
the
altered
local
conditions
under
which
it
lives
one
day
while
walking
along
a
forest
pathway
i
saw
one
of
these
lively
little
fellows
miss
his
grasp
as
he
was
passing
from
one
tree
to
another
along
with
his
troop
he
fell
head
foremost
from
a
height
of
at
least
fifty
feet
but
managed
cleverly
to
alight
on
his
legs
in
the
pathway
quickly
turning
around
gave
me
a
good
stare
for
a
few
moments
and
then
bounded
off
gaily
to
climb
another
tree
at
tunantins
i
shot
a
pair
of
a
very
handsome
species
of
marmoset
the
rufiventer
i
believe
of
zoologists
its
coat
was
very
glossy
and
smooth
the
back
deep
brown
and
the
underside
of
the
body
of
rich
black
and
reddish
hues
a
third
species
found
at
tabatinga
miles
further
west
is
of
a
deep
black
colour
with
the
exception
of
a
patch
of
white
hair
around
its
mouth
the
little
animal
at
a
short
distance
looks
as
though
it
held
a
ball
of
cotton
in
its
teeth
the
last
i
shall
mention
is
the
hapale
pygmaeus
one
of
the
most
diminutive
forms
of
the
monkey
order
three
specimens
of
which
measuring
only
seven
inches
in
length
of
body
i
obtained
near
paulo
the
pretty
lilliputian
face
is
furnished
with
long
brown
whiskers
which
are
naturally
brushed
back
over
the
cars
the
general
colour
of
the
animal
is
but
the
tail
is
elegantly
barred
with
black
i
was
surprised
on
my
return
to
england
to
learn
from
specimens
in
the
british
museum
that
the
pigmy
marmoset
was
found
also
in
mexico
no
other
amazonian
monkey
being
known
to
wander
far
from
the
great
river
plain
thus
the
smallest
and
apparently
the
feeblest
species
of
the
whole
order
is
one
which
has
by
some
means
become
the
most
widely
dispersed
the
a
curious
animal
known
to
naturalists
as
the
kinkajou
but
called
jupura
by
the
indians
of
the
amazons
and
considered
by
them
as
a
kind
of
monkey
may
be
mentioned
in
this
place
it
is
the
cercoleptes
caudivolvus
of
zoologists
and
has
been
considered
by
some
authors
as
an
intermediate
form
between
the
lemur
family
of
apes
and
the
plantigrade
carnivora
or
bear
family
it
has
decidedly
no
close
relation
ship
to
either
of
the
groups
of
american
monkeys
having
six
cutting
teeth
to
each
jaw
and
long
claws
instead
of
nails
with
extremities
of
the
usual
shape
of
paws
instead
of
hands
its
muzzle
is
conical
and
pointed
like
that
of
many
lemurs
of
madagascar
the
expression
of
its
countenance
and
its
habits
and
actions
are
also
very
similar
to
those
of
lemurs
its
tail
is
very
flexible
towards
the
tip
and
is
used
to
twine
round
branches
in
climbing
i
did
not
see
or
hear
anything
of
this
animal
while
residing
on
the
lower
amazons
but
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
river
from
the
teffe
to
peru
it
appeared
to
be
rather
common
it
is
nocturnal
in
its
habits
like
the
monkeys
although
unlike
them
it
has
a
bright
dark
eye
i
once
saw
it
in
considerable
numbers
when
on
an
excursion
with
an
indian
companion
along
the
low
ygapo
shores
of
the
teffe
about
twenty
miles
above
ega
we
slept
one
night
at
the
house
of
a
native
family
living
in
the
thick
of
the
forest
where
a
festival
was
going
on
and
there
being
no
room
to
hang
our
hammocks
under
shelter
on
account
of
the
number
of
visitors
we
lay
down
on
a
mat
in
the
open
air
near
a
shed
which
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
grove
of
and
pupunha
palms
past
midnight
when
all
became
still
after
the
uproar
of
holidaymaking
as
i
was
listening
to
the
dull
fanning
sound
made
by
the
wings
of
impish
hosts
of
vampire
bats
crowding
round
the
caju
trees
a
rustle
commenced
from
the
side
of
the
woods
and
a
troop
of
slender
animals
were
seen
against
the
clear
moonlit
sky
taking
flying
leaps
from
branch
to
branch
through
the
grove
many
of
them
stopped
at
the
pupunha
trees
and
the
hustling
twittering
and
screaming
with
sounds
of
falling
fruits
showed
how
they
were
employed
i
thought
at
first
they
were
nyctipitheci
but
they
proved
to
be
jupuras
for
the
owner
of
the
house
early
next
morning
caught
a
young
one
and
gave
it
to
me
i
kept
this
as
a
pet
animal
for
several
weeks
feeding
it
on
bananas
and
mixed
with
treacle
it
became
tame
in
a
very
short
time
allowing
itself
to
be
caressed
but
making
a
distinction
in
the
degree
of
confidence
it
showed
between
myself
and
strangers
my
pet
was
unfortunately
killed
by
a
neighbour
dog
which
entered
the
room
where
it
was
kept
the
animal
is
so
difficult
to
obtain
alive
its
place
of
retreat
in
the
daytime
not
being
known
to
the
natives
that
i
was
unable
to
procure
a
second
living
specimen
bats
the
only
other
mammals
that
i
shall
mention
are
the
bats
which
exist
in
very
considerable
numbers
and
variety
in
the
forest
as
well
as
in
the
buildings
of
the
villages
many
small
and
curious
species
living
in
the
woods
conceal
themselves
by
day
under
the
broad
of
heliconiae
and
other
plants
which
grow
in
shady
places
others
cling
to
the
trunks
of
trees
while
walking
through
the
forest
in
the
daytime
especially
along
gloomy
ravines
one
is
almost
sure
to
startle
bats
from
their
and
at
night
they
are
often
seen
in
great
numbers
flitting
about
the
trees
on
the
shady
margins
of
narrow
channels
i
captured
altogether
without
giving
especial
attention
to
bats
sixteen
different
species
at
ega
the
vampire
the
little
grey
phyllostoma
mentioned
in
a
former
chapter
as
found
in
my
chamber
at
caripi
was
not
uncommon
at
ega
where
everyone
believes
it
to
visit
sleepers
and
bleed
them
in
the
night
but
the
vampire
was
here
by
far
the
most
abundant
of
the
family
of
bats
it
is
the
largest
of
all
the
south
american
species
measuring
inches
in
expanse
of
wing
nothing
in
animal
physiognomy
can
be
more
hideous
than
the
countenance
of
this
creature
when
viewed
from
the
front
the
large
leathery
ears
standing
out
from
the
sides
and
top
of
the
head
the
erect
appendage
on
the
tip
of
the
nose
the
grin
and
the
glistening
black
eye
all
combining
to
make
up
a
figure
that
reminds
one
of
some
mocking
imp
of
fable
no
wonder
that
imaginative
people
have
inferred
diabolical
instincts
on
the
part
of
so
ugly
an
animal
the
vampire
however
is
the
most
harmless
of
all
bats
and
its
inoffensive
character
is
well
known
to
residents
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
i
found
two
distinct
species
of
it
one
having
the
fur
of
a
blackish
colour
the
other
of
a
ruddy
hue
and
ascertained
that
both
feed
chiefly
on
fruits
the
church
at
ega
was
the
headquarters
of
both
kinds
i
used
to
see
them
as
i
sat
at
my
door
during
the
short
evening
twilights
trooping
forth
by
scores
from
a
large
open
window
at
the
back
of
the
altar
twittering
cheerfully
as
they
sped
off
to
the
borders
of
the
forest
they
sometimes
enter
houses
the
first
time
i
saw
one
in
my
chamber
wheeling
heavily
round
and
round
i
mistook
it
for
a
pigeon
thinking
that
a
tame
one
had
escaped
from
the
premises
of
one
of
my
neighbours
i
opened
the
stomachs
of
several
of
these
bats
and
found
them
to
contain
a
mass
of
pulp
and
seeds
of
fruits
mingled
with
a
few
remains
of
insects
the
natives
say
they
devour
ripe
cajus
and
guavas
on
trees
in
the
gardens
but
on
comparing
the
seeds
taken
from
their
stomachs
with
those
of
all
cultivated
trees
at
ega
i
found
they
were
unlike
any
of
them
it
is
therefore
probable
that
they
generally
resort
to
the
forest
to
feed
coming
to
the
village
in
the
morning
to
sleep
because
they
find
it
more
secure
from
animals
of
prey
than
their
natural
abides
in
the
woods
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
mention
several
of
the
more
interesting
birds
found
in
the
ega
district
the
first
thing
that
would
strike
a
newcomer
in
the
forests
of
the
upper
amazons
would
be
the
general
scarcity
of
birds
indeed
it
often
happened
that
i
did
not
meet
with
a
single
bird
during
a
whole
ramble
in
the
richest
and
most
varied
parts
of
the
woods
yet
the
country
is
tenanted
by
many
hundred
species
many
of
which
are
in
reality
abundant
and
some
of
them
conspicuous
from
their
brilliant
plumage
the
cause
of
their
apparent
rarity
is
to
be
sought
in
the
sameness
and
density
of
the
thousand
miles
of
forest
which
constitute
their
the
birds
of
the
country
are
gregarious
at
least
during
the
season
when
they
are
most
readily
found
but
the
frugivorous
kinds
are
to
be
met
with
only
when
certain
wild
fruits
are
ripe
and
to
know
the
exact
localities
of
the
trees
requires
months
of
experience
it
would
not
be
supposed
that
the
insectivorous
birds
are
also
gregarious
but
they
are
so
numbers
of
distinct
species
belonging
to
many
different
families
joining
together
in
the
chase
or
search
of
food
the
proceedings
of
these
associated
bands
of
are
not
a
little
curious
and
merit
a
few
remarks
while
hunting
along
the
narrow
pathways
that
are
made
through
the
forest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
houses
and
villages
one
may
pass
several
days
without
seeing
many
birds
but
now
and
then
the
surrounding
bushes
and
trees
appear
suddenly
to
swarm
with
them
there
are
scores
probably
hundreds
of
birds
all
moving
about
with
the
greatest
activity
woodpeckers
and
dendrocolaptidae
from
species
no
larger
than
a
sparrow
to
others
the
size
of
a
crow
running
up
the
tree
trunks
tanagers
hummingbirds
and
barbets
flitting
about
the
leaves
and
lower
branches
the
bustling
crowd
loses
no
time
and
although
moving
in
concert
each
bird
is
occupied
on
its
own
account
in
searching
bark
or
leaf
or
twig
the
barbets
visit
every
clayey
nest
of
termites
on
the
trees
which
lie
in
the
line
of
march
in
a
few
minutes
the
host
is
gone
and
the
forest
path
remains
deserted
and
silent
as
before
i
became
in
course
of
time
so
accustomed
to
this
habit
of
birds
in
the
woods
near
ega
that
i
could
generally
find
the
flock
of
associated
marauders
whenever
i
wanted
it
there
appeared
to
be
only
one
of
these
flocks
in
each
small
district
and
as
it
traversed
chiefly
a
limited
tract
of
woods
of
second
growth
i
used
to
try
different
paths
until
i
came
up
with
it
the
indians
have
noticed
these
miscellaneous
hunting
parties
of
birds
but
appear
not
to
have
observed
that
they
are
occupied
in
searching
for
insects
they
have
supplied
their
want
of
knowledge
in
the
usual
way
of
people
by
a
theory
which
has
degenerated
into
a
myth
to
the
effect
that
the
onward
moving
bands
are
led
by
a
little
grey
bird
called
the
which
fascinates
all
the
rest
and
leads
them
a
weary
dance
through
the
thickets
there
is
certainly
some
appearance
of
truth
in
this
explanation
for
sometimes
stray
birds
encountered
in
the
line
of
march
are
seen
to
be
drawn
into
the
throng
and
purely
frugivorous
birds
are
now
and
then
found
mixed
up
with
the
rest
as
though
led
away
by
some
the
native
women
even
the
white
and
inhabitants
of
the
towns
attach
a
superstitious
value
to
the
skin
and
feathers
of
the
believing
that
if
they
keep
them
in
their
clothes
chest
the
relics
will
have
the
effect
of
attracting
for
the
happy
possessors
a
train
of
lovers
and
followers
these
birds
are
consequently
in
great
demand
in
some
places
the
hunters
selling
them
at
a
high
price
to
the
foolish
girls
who
preserve
the
bodies
by
drying
flesh
and
feathers
together
in
the
sun
i
could
never
get
a
sight
of
this
famous
little
bird
in
the
forest
i
once
employed
indians
to
obtain
specimens
for
me
but
after
the
same
man
who
was
a
noted
woodsman
brought
me
at
different
times
three
distinct
species
of
birds
as
the
i
gave
up
the
story
as
a
piece
of
humbug
the
simplest
explanation
appears
to
be
this
the
birds
associate
in
flocks
from
the
instinct
of
in
order
to
be
a
less
easy
prey
to
hawks
snakes
and
other
enemies
than
they
would
be
if
feeding
alone
toucans
cuvier
toucan
of
this
family
of
birds
so
conspicuous
from
the
great
size
and
light
structure
of
their
beaks
and
so
characteristic
of
tropical
american
forests
five
species
inhabit
the
woods
of
ega
the
commonest
is
cuvier
toucan
a
large
bird
distinguished
from
its
nearest
relatives
by
the
feathers
at
the
bottom
of
the
back
being
of
a
saffron
hue
instead
of
red
it
is
found
more
or
less
numerously
throughout
the
year
as
it
breeds
in
the
neighbourhood
laying
its
eggs
in
holes
of
trees
at
a
great
height
from
the
ground
during
most
months
of
the
year
it
is
met
with
in
single
individuals
or
small
flocks
and
the
birds
are
then
very
wary
sometimes
one
of
these
little
bands
of
four
or
five
is
seen
perched
for
hours
together
among
the
topmost
branches
of
high
trees
giving
vent
to
their
remarkably
loud
shrill
yelping
cries
one
bird
mounted
higher
than
the
rest
acting
apparently
as
leader
of
the
inharmonious
chorus
but
two
of
them
are
often
heard
yelping
alternately
and
in
different
notes
these
cries
have
a
vague
resemblance
to
the
syllables
tocano
tocano
and
hence
the
indian
name
of
this
genus
of
birds
at
these
times
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
shot
at
toucans
for
their
senses
are
so
sharpened
that
they
descry
the
hunter
before
he
gets
near
the
tree
on
which
they
are
perched
although
he
may
be
among
the
underwood
feet
below
them
they
stretch
their
necks
downwards
to
look
beneath
and
on
espying
the
least
movement
among
the
foliage
fly
off
to
the
more
inaccessible
parts
of
the
forest
solitary
toucans
are
sometimes
met
with
at
the
same
season
hopping
silently
up
and
down
the
larger
boughs
and
peering
into
crevices
of
the
they
moult
in
the
months
from
march
to
june
some
individuals
earlier
others
later
this
season
of
enforced
quiet
being
passed
they
make
their
appearance
suddenly
in
the
dry
forest
near
ega
in
large
flocks
probably
assemblages
of
birds
gathered
together
from
the
neighbouring
ygapo
forests
which
are
then
flooded
and
cold
the
birds
have
now
become
exceedingly
tame
and
the
troops
travel
with
heavy
laborious
flight
from
bough
to
bough
among
the
lower
trees
they
thus
become
an
easy
prey
to
hunters
and
everyone
at
ega
who
can
get
a
gun
of
any
sort
and
a
few
charges
of
powder
and
shot
or
a
goes
daily
to
the
woods
to
kill
a
few
brace
for
dinner
for
as
already
observed
the
people
of
ega
live
almost
exclusively
on
stewed
and
roasted
toucans
during
the
months
of
june
and
july
the
birds
being
then
very
fat
and
the
meat
exceedingly
sweet
and
tender
no
one
on
seeing
a
toucan
can
help
asking
what
is
the
use
of
the
enormous
bill
which
in
some
species
attains
a
length
of
seven
inches
and
a
width
of
more
than
two
inches
a
few
remarks
on
this
subject
may
be
here
introduced
the
early
naturalists
having
seen
only
the
bill
of
a
toucan
which
was
esteemed
as
a
marvellous
production
by
the
virtuosi
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
concluded
that
the
bird
must
have
belonged
to
the
aquatic
and
order
as
this
contains
so
many
species
of
remarkable
development
of
beak
adapted
for
seizing
fish
some
travvellers
also
related
fabulous
stories
of
toucans
resorting
to
the
banks
of
rivers
to
feed
on
fish
and
these
accounts
also
encouraged
the
erroneous
views
of
the
habits
of
the
birds
which
for
a
long
time
prevailed
toucans
however
are
now
well
known
to
be
eminently
arboreal
birds
and
to
belong
to
a
group
including
trogons
parrots
and
barbets
capitoninae
r
gray
all
of
whose
members
are
on
the
amazons
where
these
birds
are
very
common
no
one
pretends
ever
to
have
seen
a
toucan
walking
on
the
ground
in
its
natural
state
much
less
acting
the
part
of
a
swimming
or
wading
bird
professor
owen
found
on
dissection
that
the
gizzard
in
toucans
is
not
so
well
adapted
for
the
trituration
of
food
as
it
is
in
other
vegetable
feeders
and
concluded
therefore
as
broderip
had
observed
the
habit
of
chewing
the
cud
in
a
tame
bird
that
the
great
toothed
bill
was
useful
in
holding
and
remasticating
the
food
the
bill
can
scarcely
be
said
to
be
a
very
good
contrivance
for
seizing
and
crushing
small
birds
or
taking
them
from
their
nests
in
crevices
of
trees
habits
which
have
been
imputed
to
toucans
by
some
writers
the
hollow
cellular
structure
of
the
interior
of
the
bill
its
curved
and
clumsy
shape
and
the
deficiency
of
force
and
precision
when
it
is
used
to
seize
objects
suggest
a
want
of
fitness
if
this
be
the
function
of
the
member
but
fruit
is
undoubtedly
the
chief
food
of
toucans
and
it
is
in
reference
to
their
mode
of
obtaining
it
that
the
use
of
their
uncouth
bills
is
to
be
sought
flowers
and
fruit
on
the
crowns
of
the
large
trees
of
south
american
forests
grow
principally
towards
the
end
of
slender
twigs
which
will
not
bear
any
considerable
weight
all
animals
therefore
which
feed
upon
fruit
or
on
insects
contained
in
flowers
must
of
course
have
some
means
of
reaching
the
ends
of
the
stalks
from
a
distance
monkeys
obtain
their
food
by
stretching
forth
their
long
arms
and
in
some
instances
their
tails
to
bring
the
fruit
near
to
their
mouths
hummingbirds
are
endowed
with
highly
perfected
organs
of
flight
with
corresponding
muscular
development
by
which
they
are
enabled
to
sustain
themselves
on
the
wing
before
blossoms
whilst
rifling
them
of
their
contents
these
creatures
however
will
whenever
they
can
get
near
enough
remain
on
their
perches
while
probing
neighbouring
flowers
for
insects
trogons
have
feeble
wings
and
a
dull
inactive
temperament
their
mode
of
obtaining
food
is
to
station
themselves
quietly
on
low
branches
in
the
gloomy
shades
of
the
forest
and
eye
the
fruits
on
the
surrounding
trees
darting
off
as
if
with
an
effort
every
time
they
wish
to
seize
a
mouthful
and
returning
to
the
same
perch
barbets
capitoninae
seem
to
have
no
especial
endowment
either
of
habits
or
structure
to
enable
them
to
seize
fruits
and
in
this
respect
they
are
similar
to
the
toucans
if
we
leave
the
bill
out
of
question
both
tribes
having
heavy
bodies
with
feeble
organs
of
flight
so
that
they
are
disabled
from
taking
their
food
on
the
wing
the
purpose
of
the
enormous
bill
here
becomes
evident
it
is
to
enable
the
toucan
to
reach
and
devour
fruit
whil
remaining
seated
and
thus
to
counterbalance
the
disadvantage
which
its
heavy
body
and
gluttonous
appetite
would
otherwise
give
it
in
the
competition
with
allied
groups
of
birds
the
relation
between
the
extraordinarily
lengthened
bill
of
the
toucan
and
its
mode
of
obtaining
food
is
therefore
precisely
similar
to
that
between
the
long
neck
and
lips
of
the
giraffe
and
the
mode
of
browsing
of
the
animal
the
bill
of
the
toucan
can
scarcely
be
considered
a
very
instrument
for
the
end
to
which
it
is
applied
as
here
explained
but
nature
appears
not
to
invent
organs
at
once
for
the
functions
to
which
they
are
now
adapted
but
avails
herself
here
of
one
structure
or
instinct
there
of
another
according
as
they
are
handy
when
need
for
their
further
modification
arises
one
day
whil
walking
along
the
principal
pathway
in
the
woods
near
ega
i
saw
one
of
these
toucans
seated
gravely
on
a
low
branch
close
to
the
road
and
had
no
difficulty
in
seizing
it
with
my
hand
it
turned
out
to
be
a
runaway
pet
bird
no
one
however
came
to
own
it
although
i
kept
it
in
my
house
for
several
months
the
bird
was
in
a
and
sickly
condition
but
after
a
few
days
of
good
living
it
recovered
health
and
spirits
and
became
one
of
the
most
amusing
pets
imaginable
many
excellent
accounts
of
the
habits
of
tame
toucans
have
been
published
and
therefore
i
need
not
describe
them
in
detail
but
i
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
any
notice
of
their
intelligence
and
confiding
disposition
under
domestication
in
which
qualities
my
pet
seemed
to
be
almost
equal
to
parrots
i
allowed
tocano
to
go
free
about
the
house
contrary
to
my
usual
practice
with
pet
animals
he
never
however
mounted
my
table
after
a
smart
correction
which
he
received
the
first
time
he
did
it
he
used
to
sleep
on
the
top
of
a
box
in
a
corner
of
the
room
in
the
usual
position
of
these
birds
namely
with
the
long
tail
laid
right
over
on
the
back
and
the
beak
thrust
underneath
the
wing
he
ate
of
everything
that
we
eat
beef
turtle
fish
farinha
fruit
and
was
a
constant
attendant
at
our
table
a
cloth
spread
on
a
mat
his
appetite
was
most
ravenous
and
his
powers
of
digestion
quite
wonderful
he
got
to
know
the
meal
hours
to
a
nicety
and
we
found
it
very
difficult
after
the
first
week
or
two
to
keep
him
away
from
the
where
he
had
become
very
impudent
and
troublesome
we
tried
to
shut
him
out
by
enclosing
him
in
the
backyard
which
was
separated
by
a
high
fence
from
the
street
on
which
our
front
door
opened
but
he
used
to
climb
the
fence
and
hop
round
by
a
long
circuit
to
the
making
his
appearance
with
the
greatest
punctuality
as
the
meal
was
placed
on
the
table
he
acquired
the
habit
afterwards
of
rambling
about
the
street
near
our
house
and
one
day
he
was
stolen
so
we
gave
him
up
for
lost
but
two
days
afterwards
he
stepped
through
the
open
doorway
at
dinner
hour
with
his
old
gait
and
sly
expression
having
escaped
from
the
house
where
he
had
been
guarded
by
the
person
who
had
stolen
him
and
which
was
situated
at
the
further
end
of
the
village
the
toucan
pteroglossus
beauharnaisii
of
the
four
smaller
toucans
or
arassaris
found
near
ega
the
pteroglossus
flavirostris
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
in
colours
its
breast
being
adorned
with
broad
belts
of
rich
crimson
and
black
but
the
most
curious
species
by
far
is
the
or
beauharnais
toucan
the
feathers
on
the
head
of
this
singular
bird
are
transformed
into
thin
horny
plates
of
a
lustrous
black
colour
curled
up
at
the
ends
and
resembling
shavings
of
steel
or
the
curly
crest
being
arranged
on
the
crown
in
the
form
of
a
wig
wallace
and
i
first
met
with
this
species
on
ascending
the
amazons
at
the
mouth
of
the
solimoens
from
that
point
it
continues
as
a
rather
common
bird
on
the
terra
firma
at
least
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
as
far
as
fonte
boa
but
i
did
not
hear
of
its
being
found
further
to
the
west
it
appears
in
large
flocks
in
the
forests
near
ega
in
may
and
june
when
it
has
completed
its
moult
i
did
not
find
these
bands
congregated
at
but
always
wandering
through
the
forest
hopping
from
branch
to
branch
among
the
lower
trees
and
partly
concealed
among
the
foliage
none
of
the
arassaris
to
my
knowledge
make
a
yelping
noise
like
that
uttered
by
the
larger
toucans
ramphastos
the
notes
of
the
species
are
very
singular
resembling
the
croaking
of
frogs
i
had
an
amusing
adventure
one
day
with
these
birds
i
had
shot
one
from
a
rather
high
tree
in
a
dark
glen
in
the
forest
and
entered
the
thicket
where
the
bird
had
fallen
to
secure
my
booty
it
was
only
wounded
and
on
my
attempting
to
seize
it
set
up
a
loud
scream
in
an
instant
as
if
by
magic
the
shady
nook
seemed
alive
with
these
birds
although
there
was
certainly
none
visible
when
i
entered
the
jungle
they
descended
towards
me
hopping
from
bough
to
bough
some
of
them
swinging
on
the
loops
and
cables
of
woody
lianas
and
all
croaking
and
fluttering
their
wings
like
so
many
furies
if
i
had
had
a
long
stick
in
my
hand
i
could
have
knocked
several
of
them
over
after
killing
the
wounded
one
i
began
to
prepare
for
obtaining
more
specimens
and
punishing
the
viragos
for
their
boldness
but
the
screaming
of
their
companion
having
ceased
they
remounted
the
trees
and
before
i
could
reload
every
one
of
them
had
disappeared
upwards
of
species
of
insects
were
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ega
i
must
confine
myself
in
this
place
to
a
few
remarks
on
the
order
lepidoptera
and
on
the
ants
several
kinds
of
which
found
chiefly
on
the
upper
amazons
exhibit
the
most
extraordinary
instincts
i
found
about
distinct
species
of
butterflies
at
ega
those
who
know
a
little
of
entomology
will
be
able
to
form
some
idea
of
the
riches
of
the
place
in
this
department
when
i
mention
that
eighteen
species
of
true
papilio
the
genus
were
found
within
ten
minutes
walk
of
my
house
no
fact
could
speak
more
plainly
for
the
surpassing
exuberance
of
the
vegetation
the
varied
nature
of
the
land
the
perennial
warmth
and
humidity
of
the
climate
but
no
description
can
convey
an
adequate
notion
of
the
beauty
and
diversity
in
form
and
colour
of
this
class
of
insects
in
the
neighbourhood
of
ega
i
paid
special
attention
to
them
having
found
that
this
tribe
was
better
adapted
than
almost
any
other
group
of
animals
or
plants
to
furnish
facts
in
illustration
of
the
modifications
which
all
species
undergo
in
nature
under
changed
local
conditions
this
accidental
superiority
is
owing
partly
to
the
simplicity
and
distinctness
of
the
specific
character
of
the
insects
and
partly
to
the
facility
with
which
very
copious
series
of
specimens
can
be
collected
and
placed
side
by
side
for
comparison
the
distinctness
of
the
specific
characters
is
due
probably
to
the
fact
that
all
the
superficial
signs
of
change
in
the
organisation
are
exaggerated
and
made
unusually
plain
by
affecting
the
framework
shape
and
colour
of
the
wings
which
as
many
anatomists
believe
are
magnified
extensions
of
the
skin
around
the
breathing
orifices
of
the
thorax
of
the
insects
these
expansions
are
clothed
with
minute
feathers
or
scales
coloured
in
regular
patterns
which
vary
in
accordance
with
the
slightest
change
in
the
conditions
to
which
the
species
are
exposed
it
may
be
said
therefore
that
on
these
expanded
membranes
nature
writes
as
on
a
tablet
the
story
of
the
modifications
of
species
so
truly
do
all
changes
of
the
organisation
register
themselves
thereon
moreover
the
same
of
the
wings
generally
show
with
great
regularity
the
degrees
of
of
the
species
as
the
laws
of
nature
must
be
the
same
for
all
beings
the
conclusions
furnished
by
this
group
of
insects
must
be
applicable
to
the
whole
organic
world
therefore
the
study
of
butterflies
creatures
selected
as
the
types
of
airiness
and
frivolity
instead
of
being
despised
will
some
day
be
valued
as
one
of
the
most
important
branches
of
biological
science
before
proceeding
to
describe
the
ants
a
few
remarks
may
be
made
on
the
singular
cases
and
cocoons
woven
by
the
caterpillars
of
certain
moths
found
at
ega
the
first
that
may
be
mentioned
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
examples
of
insect
workmanship
i
ever
saw
it
is
a
cocoon
about
the
size
of
a
sparrow
egg
woven
by
a
caterpillar
in
broad
meshes
of
either
buff
or
silk
and
is
frequently
seen
in
the
narrow
alleys
of
the
forest
suspended
from
the
extreme
tip
of
an
outstanding
leaf
by
a
strong
silken
thread
five
or
six
inches
in
length
it
forms
a
very
conspicuous
object
hanging
thus
in
the
glossy
threads
with
which
it
is
knitted
are
stout
and
the
structure
is
therefore
not
liable
to
be
torn
by
the
beaks
of
insectivorous
birds
while
its
pendulous
position
makes
it
doubly
secure
against
their
attacks
the
apparatus
giving
way
when
they
peck
at
it
there
is
a
small
orifice
at
each
end
of
the
bag
to
admit
of
the
escape
of
the
moth
when
it
changes
from
the
little
chrysalis
which
sleeps
tranquilly
in
its
airy
cage
the
moth
is
of
a
dull
slatey
colour
and
belongs
to
the
lithosiide
group
of
the
family
bombycidae
when
the
caterpillar
begins
its
work
it
lets
itself
down
from
the
tip
of
the
leaf
which
it
has
chosen
by
spinning
a
thread
of
silk
the
thickness
of
which
it
slowly
increases
as
it
descends
having
given
the
proper
length
to
the
cord
it
proceeds
to
weave
its
elegant
bag
placing
itself
in
the
centre
and
spinning
rings
of
silk
at
regular
intervals
connecting
them
at
the
same
time
by
means
of
cross
threads
so
that
the
whole
when
finished
forms
a
loose
web
with
quadrangular
meshes
of
nearly
equal
size
throughout
the
task
occupies
about
four
days
when
finished
the
enclosed
caterpillar
becomes
sluggish
its
skin
shrivels
and
cracks
and
there
then
remains
a
motionless
chrysalis
of
narrow
shape
leaning
against
the
sides
of
its
silken
cage
many
other
kinds
are
found
at
ega
belonging
to
the
same
weaving
family
some
of
which
differ
from
the
rest
in
their
caterpillars
possessing
the
art
of
fabricating
cases
with
fragments
of
wood
or
leaves
in
which
they
live
secure
from
all
enemies
while
they
are
feeding
and
growing
i
saw
many
species
of
these
some
of
them
knitted
together
with
fine
silken
threads
small
bits
of
stick
and
so
made
tubes
similar
to
those
of
others
saccophora
chose
leaves
for
the
same
purpose
forming
with
them
an
elongated
bag
open
at
both
ends
and
having
the
inside
lined
with
a
thick
web
the
tubes
of
grown
caterpillars
of
saccophora
are
two
inches
in
length
and
it
is
at
this
stage
of
growth
that
i
have
generally
seen
them
they
feed
on
the
leaves
of
melastoniae
and
as
in
crawling
the
weight
of
so
large
a
dwelling
would
be
greater
than
the
contained
caterpillar
could
sustain
the
insect
attaches
the
case
by
one
or
more
threads
to
the
leaves
or
twigs
near
which
it
is
feeding
foraging
ants
many
confused
statements
have
been
published
in
books
of
travel
and
copied
in
natural
history
works
regarding
these
ants
which
appear
to
have
been
confounded
with
the
sauba
a
sketch
of
whose
habits
has
been
given
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
work
the
sauba
is
a
vegetable
feeder
and
does
not
attack
other
animals
the
accounts
that
have
been
published
regarding
carnivorous
ants
which
hunt
in
vast
armies
exciting
terror
wherever
they
go
apply
only
to
the
ecitons
or
foraging
ants
a
totally
different
group
of
this
tribe
of
insects
the
ecitons
are
called
tauoca
by
the
indians
who
are
always
on
the
for
their
armies
when
they
traverse
the
forest
so
as
to
avoid
being
attacked
i
met
with
ten
distinct
species
of
them
nearly
all
of
which
have
a
different
system
of
marching
eight
were
new
to
science
when
i
sent
them
to
england
some
are
found
commonly
in
every
part
of
the
country
and
one
is
peculiar
to
the
open
campos
of
santarem
but
as
nearly
all
the
species
are
found
together
at
ega
where
the
forest
swarmed
with
their
armies
i
have
left
an
account
of
the
habits
of
the
whole
genus
for
this
part
of
my
narrative
the
ecitons
resemble
in
their
habits
the
driver
ants
of
tropical
africa
but
they
have
no
close
relationship
with
them
in
structure
and
indeed
belong
to
quite
another
of
the
like
many
other
ants
the
communities
of
ecitons
are
composed
besides
males
and
females
of
two
classes
of
workers
a
headed
and
a
class
the
have
in
some
species
greatly
lengthened
jaws
the
have
jaws
always
of
the
ordinary
shape
but
the
two
classes
are
not
in
structure
and
function
except
in
two
of
the
species
there
is
in
all
of
them
a
little
difference
among
the
workers
regarding
the
size
of
the
head
but
in
some
species
this
is
not
sufficient
to
cause
a
separation
into
classes
with
division
of
labour
in
others
the
jaws
are
so
monstrously
lengthened
in
the
that
they
are
incapacitated
from
taking
part
in
the
labours
which
the
minors
perform
and
again
in
others
the
difference
is
so
great
that
the
distinction
of
classes
becomes
complete
one
acting
the
part
of
soldiers
and
the
other
that
of
workers
the
peculiar
feature
in
the
habits
of
the
eciton
genus
is
their
hunting
for
prey
in
regular
bodies
or
armies
it
is
this
which
chiefly
distinguishes
them
from
the
genus
of
common
red
several
species
of
which
inhabit
england
whose
habit
is
to
search
for
food
in
the
usual
irregular
manner
all
the
ecitons
hunt
in
large
organised
bodies
but
almost
every
species
has
its
own
special
manner
of
hunting
eciton
one
of
the
foragers
eciton
rapax
the
giant
of
its
genus
whose
are
in
length
hunts
in
single
file
through
the
forest
there
is
no
division
into
classes
amongst
its
workers
although
the
difference
in
size
is
very
great
some
being
scarcely
the
length
of
others
the
head
and
jaws
however
are
always
of
the
same
shape
and
a
gradation
in
size
is
presented
from
the
largest
to
the
smallest
so
that
all
are
able
to
take
part
in
the
common
labours
of
the
colony
the
chief
employment
of
the
species
seems
to
be
plundering
the
nests
of
a
large
and
defenseless
ant
of
another
genus
formica
whose
mangled
bodies
i
have
often
seen
in
their
possession
as
they
were
marching
away
the
armies
of
eciton
rapax
are
never
very
numerous
eciton
another
species
legionis
agrees
with
rapax
in
having
workers
not
rigidly
divisible
into
two
classes
but
it
is
much
smaller
in
size
not
differing
greatly
in
this
respect
from
our
common
english
red
ant
myrmica
rubra
which
it
also
resembles
in
colour
the
eciton
legionis
lives
in
open
places
and
was
seen
only
on
the
sandy
campos
of
santarem
the
movement
of
its
hosts
were
therefore
much
more
easy
to
observe
than
those
of
all
other
kinds
which
inhabit
solely
the
densest
thickets
its
sting
and
bite
also
were
less
formidable
than
those
of
other
species
the
armies
of
legionis
consist
of
many
thousands
of
individuals
and
move
in
rather
broad
columns
they
are
just
as
quick
to
break
line
on
being
disturbed
and
attack
hurriedly
and
furiously
any
intruding
object
as
the
other
ecitons
the
species
is
not
a
common
one
and
i
seldom
had
good
opportunities
to
watch
its
habits
the
first
time
i
saw
an
army
was
one
evening
near
sunset
the
column
consisted
of
two
trains
of
ants
moving
in
opposite
directions
one
train
the
other
laden
with
the
mangled
remains
of
insects
chiefly
larvae
and
pupae
of
other
ants
i
had
no
difficulty
in
tracing
the
line
to
the
spot
from
which
they
were
conveying
their
booty
this
was
a
low
thicket
the
ecitons
were
moving
rapidly
about
a
heap
of
dead
leaves
but
as
the
short
tropical
twilight
was
deepening
rapidly
and
i
had
no
wish
to
be
benighted
on
the
lonely
campos
i
deferred
further
examination
until
the
next
day
on
the
following
morning
no
trace
of
ants
could
be
found
near
the
place
where
i
had
seen
them
the
preceding
day
nor
were
there
signs
of
insects
of
any
description
in
the
thicket
but
at
the
distance
of
eighty
or
one
hundred
yards
i
came
upon
the
same
army
engaged
evidently
on
a
razzia
of
a
similar
kind
to
that
of
the
previous
evening
but
requiring
other
resources
of
their
instinct
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
wound
they
were
eagerly
occupied
on
the
face
of
an
inclined
bank
of
light
earth
in
excavating
mines
whence
from
a
depth
of
eight
or
ten
inches
they
were
extracting
the
bodies
of
a
bulky
species
of
ant
of
the
genus
formica
it
was
curious
to
see
them
crowding
around
the
orifices
of
the
mines
some
assisting
their
comrades
to
lift
out
the
bodies
of
the
formicae
and
others
tearing
them
in
pieces
on
account
of
their
weight
being
too
great
for
a
single
eciton
a
number
of
carriers
seizing
each
a
fragment
and
carrying
it
off
down
the
slope
on
digging
into
the
earth
with
a
small
trowel
near
the
entrances
of
the
mines
i
found
the
nests
of
the
formicae
with
grubs
and
cocoons
which
the
ecitons
were
thus
invading
at
a
depth
of
about
eight
inches
from
the
surface
the
eager
freebooters
rushed
in
as
fast
as
i
excavated
and
seized
the
ants
in
my
fingers
as
i
picked
them
out
so
that
i
had
some
difficulty
in
rescuing
a
few
intact
for
specimens
in
digging
the
numerous
mines
to
get
at
their
prey
the
little
ecitons
seemed
to
be
divided
into
parties
one
set
excavating
and
another
set
carrying
away
the
grains
of
earth
when
the
shafts
became
rather
deep
the
mining
parties
had
to
climb
up
the
sides
each
time
they
wished
to
cast
out
a
pellet
of
earth
but
their
work
was
lightened
for
them
by
comrades
who
stationed
themselves
at
the
mouth
of
the
shaft
and
relieved
them
of
their
burthens
carrying
the
particles
with
an
appearance
of
foresight
which
quite
staggered
me
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
hole
to
prevent
them
from
rolling
in
again
all
the
work
seemed
thus
to
be
performed
by
intelligent
cooperation
among
the
host
of
eager
little
creatures
but
still
there
was
not
a
rigid
division
of
labour
for
some
of
them
whose
proceedings
i
watched
acted
at
one
time
as
carriers
of
pellets
and
at
another
as
miners
and
all
shortly
afterwards
assumed
the
office
of
conveyors
of
the
spoil
in
about
two
hours
all
the
nests
of
formicae
were
rifled
though
not
completely
of
their
contents
and
i
turned
towards
the
army
of
ecitons
which
were
carrying
away
the
mutilated
remains
for
some
distance
there
were
many
separate
lines
of
them
moving
along
the
slope
of
the
bank
but
a
short
distance
off
these
all
converged
and
then
formed
one
close
and
broad
column
which
continued
for
some
sixty
or
seventy
yards
and
terminated
at
one
of
those
large
termitariums
or
hillocks
of
white
ants
which
are
constructed
of
cemented
material
as
hard
as
stone
the
broad
and
compact
column
of
ants
moved
up
the
steep
sides
of
the
hillock
in
a
continued
stream
many
which
had
hitherto
trotted
along
handed
now
turned
to
assist
their
comrades
with
their
heavy
loads
and
the
whole
descended
into
a
spacious
gallery
or
mine
opening
on
the
top
of
the
termitarium
i
did
not
try
to
reach
the
nest
which
i
supposed
to
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
broad
mine
and
therefore
in
the
middle
of
the
base
of
the
stony
hillock
eciton
the
commonest
species
of
foraging
ants
are
the
eciton
hamata
and
drepanophora
two
kinds
which
resemble
each
other
so
closely
that
it
requires
attentive
examination
to
distinguish
them
yet
their
armies
never
intermingle
although
moving
in
the
same
woods
and
often
crossing
each
other
tracks
the
two
classes
of
workers
look
at
first
sight
quite
distinct
on
account
of
the
wonderful
amount
of
difference
between
the
largest
individuals
of
the
one
and
the
smallest
of
the
other
there
are
dwarfs
not
more
than
of
an
inch
in
length
with
small
heads
and
jaws
and
giants
half
an
inch
in
length
with
monstrously
enlarged
head
and
jaws
all
belonging
to
the
same
brood
there
is
not
however
a
distinct
separation
of
classes
individuals
existing
which
connect
together
the
two
extremes
these
ecitons
are
seen
in
the
pathways
of
the
forest
at
all
places
on
the
banks
of
the
amazons
travelling
in
dense
columns
of
countless
thousands
one
or
other
of
them
is
sure
to
be
met
with
in
a
woodland
ramble
and
it
is
to
them
probably
that
the
stories
we
read
in
books
on
south
america
apply
of
ants
clearing
houses
of
vermin
although
i
heard
of
no
instance
of
their
entering
houses
their
ravages
being
confined
to
the
thickest
parts
of
the
forest
when
the
pedestrian
falls
in
with
a
train
of
these
ants
the
first
signal
given
him
is
a
twittering
and
restless
movement
of
small
flocks
of
birds
in
the
jungle
if
this
be
disregarded
until
he
advances
a
few
steps
farther
he
is
sure
to
fall
into
trouble
and
find
himself
suddenly
attacked
by
numbers
of
the
ferocious
little
creatures
they
swarm
up
his
legs
with
incredible
rapidity
each
one
driving
his
jaws
into
his
skin
and
with
the
purchase
thus
obtained
doubling
in
its
tail
and
stinging
with
all
its
might
there
is
no
course
left
but
to
run
for
it
if
he
is
accompanied
by
natives
they
will
be
sure
to
give
the
alarm
crying
tauoca
and
scampering
at
full
speed
to
the
other
end
of
the
column
of
ants
the
tenacious
insects
who
have
secured
themselves
to
his
legs
then
have
to
be
plucked
off
one
by
one
a
task
which
is
generally
not
accomplished
without
pulling
them
in
twain
and
leaving
heads
and
jaws
sticking
in
the
wounds
the
errand
of
the
vast
is
plunder
as
in
the
case
of
eciton
legionis
but
from
their
moving
always
amongst
dense
thickets
their
proceedings
are
not
so
easy
to
observe
as
in
that
species
wherever
they
move
the
whole
animal
world
is
set
in
commotion
and
every
creature
tries
to
get
out
of
their
way
but
it
is
especially
the
various
tribes
of
wingless
insects
that
have
cause
for
fear
such
as
spiders
ants
of
other
species
maggots
caterpillars
larvae
of
cockroaches
and
so
forth
all
of
which
live
under
fallen
leaves
or
in
decaying
wood
the
ecitons
do
not
mount
very
high
on
trees
and
therefore
the
nestlings
of
birds
are
not
much
incommoded
by
them
the
mode
of
operation
of
these
armies
which
i
ascertained
only
after
observation
is
as
follows
the
main
column
from
four
to
six
deep
moves
forward
in
a
given
direction
clearing
the
ground
of
all
animal
matter
dead
or
alive
and
throwing
off
here
and
there
a
thinner
column
to
forage
for
a
short
time
on
the
flanks
of
the
main
army
and
it
again
after
their
task
is
accomplished
if
some
very
rich
place
be
encountered
anywhere
near
the
line
of
march
for
example
a
mass
of
rotten
wood
abounding
in
insect
larvae
a
delay
takes
place
and
a
very
strong
force
of
ants
is
concentrated
upon
it
the
excited
creatures
search
every
cranny
and
tear
in
pieces
all
the
large
grubs
they
drag
to
light
it
is
curious
to
see
them
attack
nests
which
are
sometimes
built
on
low
shrubs
they
gnaw
away
the
papery
covering
to
get
at
the
larvae
pupae
and
hatched
wasps
and
cut
everything
to
tatters
regardless
of
the
infuriated
owners
which
are
flying
about
them
in
bearing
off
their
spoil
in
fragments
the
pieces
are
apportioned
to
the
carriers
with
some
degree
of
regard
to
fairness
of
load
the
dwarfs
taking
the
smallest
pieces
and
the
strongest
fellows
with
small
heads
the
heaviest
portions
sometimes
two
ants
join
together
in
carrying
one
piece
but
the
with
their
unwieldy
and
distorted
jaws
are
incapacitated
from
taking
any
part
in
the
labour
the
armies
never
march
far
on
a
beaten
path
but
seem
to
prefer
the
entangled
thickets
where
it
is
seldom
possible
to
follow
them
i
have
traced
an
army
sometimes
for
half
a
mile
or
more
but
was
never
able
to
find
one
that
had
finished
its
day
course
and
returned
to
its
hive
indeed
i
never
met
with
a
hive
whenever
the
ecitons
were
seen
they
were
always
on
the
march
i
thought
one
day
at
villa
nova
that
i
had
come
upon
a
migratory
horde
of
this
indefatigable
ant
the
place
was
a
tract
of
open
ground
near
the
river
side
just
outside
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
surrounded
by
rocks
and
shrubbery
a
dense
column
of
ecitons
was
seen
extending
from
the
rocks
on
one
side
of
the
little
haven
traversing
the
open
space
and
ascending
the
opposite
declivity
the
length
of
the
procession
was
from
sixty
to
seventy
yards
and
yet
neither
van
nor
rear
was
visible
all
were
moving
in
one
and
the
same
direction
except
a
few
individuals
on
the
outside
of
the
column
which
were
running
rearward
trotting
along
for
a
short
distance
and
then
turning
again
to
follow
the
same
course
as
the
main
body
but
these
rearward
movements
were
going
on
continually
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
line
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
there
being
a
means
of
keeping
up
a
common
understanding
amongst
all
the
members
of
the
army
for
the
retrograding
ants
stopped
very
often
for
a
moment
to
touch
one
or
other
of
their
comrades
with
their
antennae
a
proceeding
which
has
been
noticed
in
other
ants
and
supposed
to
be
their
mode
of
conveying
intelligence
when
i
interfered
with
the
column
or
abstracted
an
individual
from
it
news
of
the
disturbance
was
very
quickly
communicated
to
a
distance
of
several
yards
towards
the
rear
and
the
column
at
that
point
commenced
retreating
all
the
headed
workers
carried
in
their
jaws
a
little
cluster
of
white
maggots
which
i
thought
at
the
time
might
be
young
larvae
of
their
own
colony
but
afterwards
found
reason
to
conclude
were
the
grubs
of
some
other
species
whose
nests
they
had
been
plundering
the
procession
being
most
likely
not
a
migration
but
a
column
on
a
marauding
expedition
the
position
of
the
individuals
in
the
marching
column
was
rather
curious
there
was
one
of
these
extraordinary
fellows
to
about
a
score
of
the
smaller
class
none
of
them
carried
anything
in
their
mouths
but
all
trotted
along
handed
and
outside
the
column
at
pretty
regular
intervals
from
each
other
like
subaltern
officers
in
a
marching
regiment
of
soldiers
it
was
easy
to
be
tolerably
exact
in
this
observation
for
their
shining
white
heads
made
them
very
conspicuous
amongst
the
rest
bobbing
up
and
down
as
the
column
passed
over
the
inequalities
of
the
road
i
did
not
see
them
change
their
position
or
take
any
notice
of
their
comrades
marching
in
the
column
and
when
i
disturbed
the
line
they
did
not
prance
forth
or
show
fight
so
eagerly
as
the
others
these
members
of
the
community
have
been
considered
by
some
authors
as
a
soldier
class
like
the
caste
in
termites
but
i
found
no
proof
of
this
at
least
in
the
present
species
as
they
always
seemed
to
be
rather
less
pugnacious
than
the
and
their
distorted
jaws
disabled
them
from
fastening
on
a
plane
surface
like
the
skin
of
an
attacking
animal
i
am
inclined
however
to
think
that
they
may
act
in
a
less
direct
way
as
protectors
of
the
community
namely
as
indigestible
morsels
to
the
flocks
of
which
follow
the
marching
columns
of
these
ecitons
and
are
the
most
formidable
enemies
of
the
species
it
is
possible
that
the
hooked
and
twisted
jaws
of
the
class
may
be
effective
weapons
of
annoyance
when
in
the
gizzards
or
stomachs
of
these
birds
but
i
unfortunately
omitted
to
ascertain
whether
this
was
really
the
fact
the
life
of
these
ecitons
is
not
all
work
for
i
frequently
saw
them
very
leisurely
employed
in
a
way
that
looked
like
recreation
when
this
happened
the
place
was
always
a
sunny
nook
in
the
forest
the
main
column
of
the
army
and
the
branch
columns
at
these
times
were
in
their
ordinary
relative
positions
but
instead
of
pressing
forward
eagerly
and
plundering
right
and
left
they
seemed
to
have
been
all
smitten
with
a
sudden
fit
of
laziness
some
were
walking
slowly
about
others
were
brushing
their
antennae
with
their
forefeet
but
the
drollest
sight
was
their
cleaning
one
another
here
and
there
an
ant
was
seen
stretching
forth
first
one
leg
and
then
another
to
be
brushed
or
washed
by
one
or
more
of
its
comrades
who
performed
the
task
by
passing
the
limb
between
the
jaws
and
the
tongue
and
finishing
by
giving
the
antennae
a
friendly
wipe
it
was
a
curious
spectacle
and
one
well
calculated
to
increase
one
amazement
at
the
similarity
between
the
instinctive
actions
of
ants
and
the
acts
of
rational
beings
a
similarity
which
must
have
been
brought
about
by
two
different
processes
of
development
of
the
primary
qualities
of
mind
the
actions
of
these
ants
looked
like
simple
indulgence
in
idle
amusement
have
these
little
creatures
then
an
excess
of
energy
beyond
what
is
required
for
labours
absolutely
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
their
species
and
do
they
thus
expend
it
in
mere
sportiveness
like
young
lambs
or
kittens
or
in
idle
whims
like
rational
beings
it
is
probable
that
these
hours
of
relaxation
and
cleaning
may
be
indispensable
to
the
effective
performance
of
their
harder
labours
but
while
looking
at
them
the
conclusion
that
the
ants
were
engaged
merely
in
play
was
irresistible
eciton
this
is
a
small
species
very
similar
to
the
common
red
of
england
it
differs
from
all
other
ecitons
in
its
habit
of
hunting
not
in
columns
but
in
dense
phalanxes
consisting
of
myriads
of
individuals
and
was
first
met
with
at
ega
where
it
is
very
common
nothing
in
insect
movements
is
more
striking
than
the
rapid
march
of
these
large
and
compact
bodies
wherever
they
pass
all
the
rest
of
the
animal
world
is
thrown
into
a
state
of
alarm
they
stream
along
the
ground
and
climb
to
the
summits
of
all
the
lower
trees
searching
every
leaf
to
its
apex
and
whenever
they
encounter
a
mass
of
decaying
vegetable
matter
where
booty
is
plentiful
they
concentrate
like
other
ecitons
all
their
forces
upon
it
the
dense
phalanx
of
shining
and
bodies
as
it
spreads
over
the
surface
looking
like
a
flood
of
liquid
they
soon
penetrate
every
part
of
the
confused
heap
and
then
gathering
together
again
in
marching
order
onward
they
move
all
and
inactive
insects
fall
an
easy
prey
to
them
and
like
other
ecitons
they
tear
their
victims
in
pieces
for
facility
of
carriage
a
phalanx
of
this
species
when
passing
over
a
tract
of
smooth
ground
occupies
a
space
of
from
four
to
six
square
yards
on
examining
the
ants
closely
they
are
seen
to
move
not
altogether
in
one
straightforward
direction
but
in
variously
spreading
contiguous
columns
now
separating
a
little
from
the
general
mass
now
with
it
the
margins
of
the
phalanx
spread
out
at
times
like
a
cloud
of
skirmishers
from
the
flanks
of
an
army
i
was
never
able
to
find
the
hive
of
this
species
blind
i
will
now
give
a
short
account
of
the
blind
species
of
eciton
none
of
the
foregoing
kinds
have
eyes
of
the
facetted
or
compound
structure
such
as
are
usual
in
insects
and
which
ordinary
ants
formica
are
furnished
with
but
all
are
provided
with
organs
of
vision
composed
each
of
a
single
lens
connecting
them
with
the
utterly
blind
species
of
the
genus
is
a
very
eciton
the
crassicornis
whose
eyes
are
sunk
in
rather
deep
sockets
this
ant
goes
on
foraging
expeditions
like
the
rest
of
its
tribe
and
attacks
even
the
nests
of
other
stinging
species
myrmica
but
it
avoids
the
light
moving
always
in
concealment
under
leaves
and
fallen
branches
when
its
columns
have
to
cross
a
cleared
space
the
ants
construct
a
temporary
covered
way
with
granules
of
earth
arched
over
and
holding
together
mechanically
under
this
the
procession
passes
in
secret
the
indefatigable
creatures
repairing
their
arcade
as
fast
as
breaches
are
made
in
it
next
in
order
comes
the
eciton
vastator
which
has
no
eyes
although
the
collapsed
sockets
are
plainly
visible
and
lastly
the
eciton
erratica
in
which
both
sockets
and
eyes
have
disappeared
leaving
only
a
faint
ring
to
mark
the
place
where
they
are
usually
situated
the
armies
of
vastator
and
erratica
move
as
far
as
i
could
learn
wholly
under
covered
roads
the
ants
constructing
them
gradually
but
rapidly
as
they
advance
the
column
of
foragers
pushes
forward
step
by
step
under
the
protection
of
these
covered
passages
through
the
thickets
and
upon
reaching
a
rotting
log
or
other
promising
ground
pour
into
the
crevices
in
search
of
booty
i
have
traced
their
arcades
occasionally
for
a
distance
of
one
or
two
hundred
yards
the
grains
of
earth
are
taken
from
the
soil
over
which
the
column
is
passing
and
are
fitted
together
without
cement
it
is
this
feature
that
distinguishes
them
from
the
similar
covered
roads
made
by
termites
who
use
their
glutinous
saliva
to
cement
the
grains
together
the
blind
ecitons
working
in
numbers
build
up
simultaneously
the
sides
of
their
convex
arcades
and
contrive
in
a
surprising
manner
to
approximate
them
and
fit
in
the
without
letting
the
loose
uncemented
structure
fall
to
pieces
there
was
a
very
clear
division
of
labour
between
the
two
classes
of
neuters
in
these
blind
species
the
class
although
not
possessing
jaws
like
the
in
hamata
and
drepanophora
are
rigidly
defined
in
structure
from
the
class
and
act
as
soldiers
defending
the
working
community
like
soldier
termites
against
all
comers
whenever
i
made
a
breach
in
one
of
their
covered
ways
all
the
ants
underneath
were
set
in
commotion
but
the
remained
behind
to
repair
the
damage
while
the
issued
forth
in
a
most
menacing
manner
rearing
their
heads
and
snapping
their
jaws
with
an
expression
of
the
fiercest
rage
and
defiance

well
exhibited
a
knowledge
of
the
river
and
powers
of
endurance
which
were
quite
remarkable
he
stood
all
this
time
at
his
post
with
the
exception
of
three
or
four
hours
in
the
middle
of
each
day
when
he
was
relieved
by
a
young
man
who
served
as
apprentice
and
he
knew
the
breadth
and
windings
of
the
channel
and
the
extent
of
all
the
shoals
from
the
rio
negro
to
loreto
a
distance
of
more
than
a
thousand
miles
there
was
no
slackening
of
speed
at
night
except
during
the
brief
but
violent
storms
which
occasionally
broke
upon
us
and
then
the
engines
were
stopped
by
the
command
of
lieutenant
nunes
sometimes
against
the
wish
of
the
pilot
the
nights
were
often
so
dark
that
we
passengers
on
the
poop
deck
could
not
discern
the
hardy
fellow
on
the
bridge
but
the
steamer
drove
on
at
full
speed
men
being
stationed
on
the
at
the
prow
to
watch
for
floating
logs
and
one
man
placed
to
pass
orders
to
the
helmsman
the
keel
scraped
against
a
only
once
during
the
passage
the
passengers
were
chiefly
peruvians
mostly
thin
anxious
men
who
were
returning
home
to
the
cities
of
moyobamba
and
chachapoyas
on
the
andes
after
a
trading
trip
to
the
brazilian
towns
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
whither
they
had
gone
six
months
previously
with
cargoes
of
panama
hats
to
exchange
for
european
wares
these
hats
are
made
of
the
young
leaflets
of
a
palm
tree
by
the
indians
and
people
who
inhabit
the
eastern
parts
of
peru
they
form
almost
the
only
article
of
export
from
peru
by
way
of
the
amazons
but
the
money
value
is
very
great
compared
with
the
bulk
of
the
goods
as
the
hats
are
generally
of
very
fine
quality
and
cost
from
twelve
shillings
to
six
pounds
sterling
each
some
traders
bring
down
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
worth
folded
into
small
compass
in
their
trunks
the
return
cargoes
consist
of
hardware
crockery
glass
and
other
bulky
or
heavy
goods
but
not
of
cloth
which
being
of
light
weight
can
be
carried
across
the
andes
from
the
ports
on
the
pacific
to
the
eastern
parts
of
peru
all
kinds
of
european
cloth
can
be
obtained
at
a
much
cheaper
rate
by
this
route
than
by
the
more
direct
way
of
the
amazons
the
import
duties
of
peru
being
as
i
was
told
lower
than
those
of
brazil
and
the
difference
not
being
by
increased
expense
of
transit
on
account
of
weight
over
the
passes
of
the
andes
there
was
a
great
lack
of
amusement
on
board
the
table
was
very
well
served
professed
cooks
being
employed
in
these
amazonian
steamers
and
fresh
meat
insured
by
keeping
on
deck
a
supply
of
live
bullocks
and
fowls
which
are
purchased
whenever
there
is
an
opportunity
on
the
road
the
river
scenery
was
similar
to
that
already
described
as
presented
between
the
rio
negro
and
ega
long
reaches
of
similar
aspect
with
two
long
low
lines
of
forest
varied
sometimes
with
cliffs
of
red
clay
appearing
one
after
the
other
an
horizon
of
water
and
sky
on
some
days
limiting
the
view
both
up
stream
and
down
we
travelled
however
always
near
the
bank
and
for
my
part
i
was
never
weary
of
admiring
the
picturesque
grouping
and
variety
of
trees
and
the
varied
mantles
of
creeping
plants
which
clothed
the
green
wall
of
forest
every
step
of
the
way
with
the
exception
of
a
small
village
called
fonte
boa
retired
from
the
main
river
where
we
stopped
to
take
in
firewood
and
which
i
shall
have
to
speak
of
presently
we
saw
no
human
habitation
the
whole
of
the
distance
the
mornings
were
delightfully
cool
coffee
was
served
at
sunrise
and
a
bountiful
breakfast
at
ten
after
that
hour
the
heat
rapidly
increased
until
it
became
almost
unbearable
how
the
and
firemen
stood
it
without
exhaustion
i
can
not
tell
it
diminished
after
four
in
the
afternoon
about
which
time
rung
and
the
evenings
were
always
pleasant
november
to
the
tunantins
is
a
sluggish
stream
about
sixty
miles
in
length
and
towards
its
mouth
from
to
yards
in
breadth
the
vegetation
on
its
banks
has
a
similar
aspect
to
that
of
the
rio
negro
the
trees
having
small
foliage
of
a
sombre
hue
and
the
dark
piles
of
greenery
resting
on
the
surface
of
the
inky
water
the
village
is
situated
on
the
left
bank
about
a
mile
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
contains
twenty
habitations
nearly
all
of
which
are
merely
hovels
built
of
and
mud
the
short
streets
after
rain
are
almost
impassable
on
account
of
the
many
puddles
and
are
choked
up
with
weeds
leguminous
shrubs
and
asclepias
the
atmosphere
in
such
a
place
hedged
in
as
it
is
by
the
lofty
forest
and
surrounded
by
swamps
is
always
close
warm
and
reeking
and
the
hum
and
chirp
of
insects
and
birds
cause
a
continual
din
the
small
patch
of
weedy
ground
around
the
village
swarms
with
plovers
sandpipers
striped
herons
and
tailed
and
alligators
are
always
seen
floating
lazily
on
the
surface
of
the
river
in
front
of
the
houses
on
landing
i
presented
myself
to
senor
paulo
bitancourt
a
natured
director
of
indians
of
the
neighbouring
river
issa
who
quickly
ordered
a
small
house
to
be
cleared
for
me
this
exhilarating
abode
contained
only
one
room
the
walls
of
which
were
disfigured
by
large
and
ugly
patches
of
mud
the
work
of
white
ants
the
floor
was
the
bare
earth
dirty
and
damp
the
wretched
chamber
was
darkened
by
a
sheet
of
calico
being
stretched
over
the
windows
a
plan
adopted
here
to
keep
out
the
which
float
about
in
all
shady
places
like
thin
clouds
of
smoke
rendering
all
repose
impossible
in
the
daytime
wherever
they
can
effect
an
entrance
my
baggage
was
soon
landed
and
before
the
steamer
departed
i
had
taken
gun
and
to
make
a
preliminary
exploration
of
my
new
locality
i
remained
here
nineteen
days
and
considering
the
shortness
of
the
time
made
a
very
good
collection
of
monkeys
birds
and
insects
a
considerable
number
of
the
species
especially
of
insects
were
different
from
those
of
the
four
other
stations
which
i
examined
on
the
south
side
of
the
solimoens
and
as
many
of
these
were
representative
forms
species
or
races
which
take
the
place
of
other
allied
species
or
races
of
others
found
on
the
opposite
banks
of
the
broad
river
i
concluded
that
there
could
have
been
no
land
connection
between
the
two
shores
during
at
least
the
recent
geological
period
this
conclusion
is
confirmed
by
the
case
of
the
uakari
monkeys
described
in
the
last
chapter
all
these
strongly
modified
local
races
of
insects
confined
to
one
side
of
the
solimoens
like
the
uakaris
are
such
as
have
not
been
able
to
cross
a
wide
treeless
space
such
as
a
river
the
acquisition
which
pleased
me
most
in
this
place
was
a
new
species
of
butterfly
a
catagramma
which
has
since
been
named
excelsior
owing
to
its
surpassing
in
size
and
beauty
all
the
species
of
its
singularly
beautiful
genus
the
upper
surface
of
the
wings
is
of
the
richest
blue
varying
in
shade
with
the
play
of
light
and
on
each
side
is
a
broad
curved
stripe
of
an
orange
colour
it
is
a
bold
flyer
and
is
not
confined
as
i
afterwards
found
to
the
northern
side
of
the
river
for
i
once
saw
a
specimen
amidst
a
number
of
butterflies
flying
about
the
deck
of
the
steamer
when
we
were
anchored
off
fonte
boa
miles
lower
down
the
river
with
the
exception
of
three
mameluco
families
and
a
stray
portuguese
trader
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
and
neighbourhood
are
indians
of
the
shumana
and
passe
tribes
the
forests
of
the
tunantins
however
are
inhabited
by
a
tribe
of
wild
indians
called
caishanas
who
resemble
much
in
their
social
condition
and
manners
the
debased
muras
of
the
lower
amazons
and
have
like
them
shown
no
aptitude
for
civilised
life
in
any
shape
their
huts
commence
at
the
distance
of
an
hour
walk
from
the
village
along
gloomy
and
narrow
forest
paths
my
first
and
only
visit
to
a
caishana
dwelling
was
accidental
one
day
having
extended
my
walk
further
than
usual
and
followed
one
of
the
until
it
became
a
mere
picada
or
hunters
track
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
pathway
bordered
on
each
side
with
lycopodia
of
the
most
elegant
shapes
the
tips
of
the
fronds
stretching
almost
like
tendrils
down
the
little
earthy
slopes
which
formed
the
edge
of
the
path
the
road
though
smooth
was
narrow
and
dark
and
in
many
places
blocked
up
by
trunks
of
felled
trees
which
had
been
apparently
thrown
across
by
the
timid
indians
on
purpose
to
obstruct
the
way
to
their
habitations
of
this
shady
road
brought
me
to
a
small
open
space
on
the
banks
of
a
brook
or
creek
on
the
skirts
of
which
stood
a
conical
hut
with
a
very
low
doorway
there
was
also
an
open
shed
with
stages
made
of
split
stems
and
a
number
of
large
wooden
troughs
two
or
three
skinned
children
with
a
man
and
woman
were
in
the
shed
but
immediately
on
espying
me
all
of
them
ran
to
the
hut
bolting
through
the
little
doorway
like
so
many
wild
animals
scared
into
their
burrows
a
few
moments
after
the
man
put
his
head
out
with
a
look
of
great
distrust
but
on
my
making
the
most
friendly
gestures
i
could
think
of
he
came
forth
with
the
children
they
were
all
smeared
with
black
mud
and
paint
the
only
clothing
of
the
elders
was
a
kind
of
apron
made
of
the
inner
bark
of
the
and
the
savage
aspect
of
the
man
was
heightened
by
his
hair
hanging
over
his
forehead
to
the
eyes
i
stayed
about
two
hours
in
the
neighbourhood
the
children
gaining
sufficient
confidence
to
come
and
help
me
to
search
for
insects
the
only
weapon
used
by
the
caishanas
is
the
and
this
is
employed
only
in
shooting
animals
for
food
they
are
not
a
warlike
people
like
most
of
the
neighbouring
tribes
on
the
japura
and
issa
the
whole
tribe
of
caishanas
does
not
exceed
souls
in
number
none
of
them
are
baptised
indians
and
they
do
not
dwell
in
villages
like
the
more
advanced
sections
of
the
tupi
stock
but
each
family
has
its
own
solitary
hut
they
are
quite
harmless
do
not
practise
tattooing
or
perforate
their
ears
and
noses
in
any
way
their
social
condition
is
of
a
low
type
very
little
removed
indeed
from
that
of
the
brutes
living
in
the
same
forests
they
do
not
appear
to
obey
any
common
chief
and
i
could
not
make
out
that
they
had
pajes
or
those
rudest
beginnings
of
a
priest
class
symbolical
or
masked
dances
and
ceremonies
in
honour
of
the
jurupari
or
demon
customs
which
prevail
among
all
the
surrounding
tribes
are
unknown
to
the
caishanas
there
is
among
them
a
trace
of
festival
keeping
but
the
only
ceremony
used
is
the
drinking
of
cashiri
beer
and
fermented
liquors
made
of
bananas
and
so
forth
these
affairs
however
are
conducted
in
a
degenerate
style
for
they
do
not
drink
to
intoxication
or
sustain
the
orgies
for
several
days
and
nights
in
succession
like
the
juris
passes
and
tucunas
the
men
play
a
musical
instrument
made
of
pieces
of
stem
of
the
cut
in
different
lengths
and
arranged
like
with
this
they
wile
away
whole
hours
lolling
in
ragged
bast
hammocks
slung
in
their
dark
smoky
huts
the
tunantins
people
say
that
the
caishanas
have
persecuted
the
wild
animals
and
birds
to
such
an
extent
near
their
settlements
that
there
is
now
quite
a
scarcity
of
animal
food
if
they
kill
a
toucan
it
is
considered
an
important
event
and
the
bird
is
made
to
serve
as
a
meal
for
a
score
or
more
persons
they
boil
the
meat
in
earthenware
kettles
filled
with
tucupi
sauce
and
eat
it
with
beiju
or
the
women
are
not
allowed
to
taste
of
the
meat
but
forced
to
content
themselves
with
sopping
pieces
of
cake
in
the
liquor
november
i
left
tunantins
in
a
trading
schooner
of
eighty
tons
burthen
belonging
to
senor
batalha
a
tradesman
of
ega
which
had
been
out
all
the
summer
collecting
produce
and
was
commanded
by
a
friend
of
mine
a
young
paraense
named
francisco
raiol
we
arrived
on
the
of
december
at
the
mouth
of
the
jutahi
a
considerable
stream
about
half
a
mile
broad
and
flowing
with
a
very
sluggish
current
this
is
one
of
the
series
of
six
rivers
from
to
miles
in
length
which
flow
from
the
southwest
through
unknown
lands
lying
between
bolivia
and
the
upper
amazons
and
enter
this
latter
river
between
the
madeira
and
the
ucayali
we
remained
at
anchor
four
days
within
the
mouth
of
the
sapo
a
small
tributary
of
the
jutahi
flowing
from
the
southeast
senor
raiol
having
to
send
an
igarite
to
the
cupatana
a
large
tributary
some
few
miles
farther
up
the
river
to
fetch
a
cargo
of
during
this
time
we
made
several
excursions
in
the
montaria
to
various
places
in
the
neighbourhood
our
longest
trip
was
to
some
indian
houses
a
distance
of
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
up
the
sapo
a
journey
made
with
one
indian
paddler
and
occupying
a
whole
day
the
stream
is
not
more
than
forty
or
fifty
yards
broad
its
waters
are
darker
in
colour
than
those
of
the
jutahi
and
flow
as
in
all
these
small
rivers
partly
under
shade
between
two
lofty
walls
of
forest
we
passed
in
ascending
seven
habitations
most
of
them
hidden
in
the
luxuriant
foliage
of
the
banks
their
sites
being
known
only
by
small
openings
in
the
compact
wall
of
forest
and
the
presence
of
a
canoe
or
two
tied
up
in
little
shady
ports
the
inhabitants
are
chiefly
indians
of
the
maraua
tribe
whose
original
territory
comprised
all
the
small
lying
between
the
jutahi
and
the
jurua
near
the
mouths
of
both
these
great
tributaries
they
live
in
separate
families
or
small
hordes
have
no
common
chief
and
are
considered
as
a
tribe
little
disposed
to
adopt
civilised
customs
or
be
friendly
with
the
whites
one
of
the
houses
belonged
to
a
juri
family
and
we
saw
the
owner
an
erect
looking
old
fellow
tattooed
as
customary
with
his
tribe
in
a
large
patch
over
the
middle
of
his
face
fishing
under
the
shade
of
a
colossal
tree
in
his
port
with
hook
and
line
he
saluted
us
in
the
usual
grave
and
courteous
manner
of
the
better
sort
of
indians
as
we
passed
by
we
reached
the
last
house
or
rather
two
houses
about
ten
and
spent
several
hours
there
during
the
great
heat
of
midday
the
houses
which
stood
on
a
high
clayey
bank
were
of
quadrangular
shape
partly
open
like
sheds
and
partly
enclosed
with
rude
forming
one
or
more
chambers
the
inhabitants
a
few
families
of
marauas
comprising
about
thirty
persons
received
us
in
a
frank
smiling
manner
a
reception
which
may
have
been
due
to
senor
raiol
being
an
old
acquaintance
and
somewhat
of
a
favourite
none
of
them
were
tattooed
but
the
men
had
great
holes
pierced
in
their
earlobes
in
which
they
insert
plugs
of
wood
and
their
lips
were
drilled
with
smaller
holes
one
of
the
younger
men
a
fine
strapping
fellow
nearly
six
feet
high
with
a
large
aquiline
nose
who
seemed
to
wish
to
be
particularly
friendly
with
me
showed
me
the
use
of
these
holes
by
fixing
a
number
of
little
white
sticks
in
them
and
then
twisting
his
mouth
about
and
going
through
a
pantomime
to
represent
defiance
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
nearly
all
the
people
were
disfigured
by
dark
blotches
on
the
skin
the
effect
of
a
cutaneous
disease
very
prevalent
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
face
of
one
old
man
was
completely
blackened
and
looked
as
though
it
had
been
smeared
with
black
lead
the
blotches
having
coalesced
to
form
one
large
patch
others
were
simply
mottled
the
black
spots
were
hard
and
rough
but
not
scaly
and
were
margined
with
rings
of
a
colour
paler
than
the
natural
hue
of
the
skin
i
had
seen
many
indians
and
a
few
at
tunantins
and
afterwards
saw
others
at
fonte
boa
blotched
in
the
same
way
the
disease
would
seem
to
be
contagious
for
i
was
told
that
a
portuguese
trader
became
disfigured
with
it
after
cohabiting
some
years
with
an
indian
woman
it
is
curious
that
although
prevalent
in
many
places
on
the
solimoens
no
resident
of
ega
exhibited
signs
of
the
disease
the
early
explorers
of
the
country
on
noticing
spotted
skins
to
be
very
frequent
in
certain
localities
thought
they
were
peculiar
to
a
few
tribes
of
indians
the
younger
children
in
these
houses
on
the
sapo
were
free
from
spots
but
two
or
three
of
them
about
ten
years
of
age
showed
signs
of
their
commencement
in
rounded
yellowish
patches
on
the
skin
and
these
appeared
languid
and
sickly
although
the
blotched
adults
seemed
not
to
be
affected
in
their
general
health
a
at
fonte
boa
told
me
he
had
cured
himself
of
the
disorder
by
strong
doses
of
sarsaparilla
the
black
patches
had
caused
the
hair
of
his
beard
and
eyebrows
to
fall
off
but
it
had
grown
again
since
his
cure
when
my
tall
friend
saw
me
after
dinner
collecting
insects
along
the
paths
near
the
houses
he
approached
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
led
me
to
a
mandioca
shed
making
signs
as
he
could
speak
very
little
tupi
that
he
had
something
to
show
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
having
mounted
the
girao
or
stage
of
split
and
taken
down
an
object
transfixed
to
a
post
he
exhibited
with
an
air
of
great
mystery
a
large
chrysalis
suspended
from
a
leaf
which
he
placed
carefully
in
my
hands
saying
curi
tupi
butterfly
thus
i
found
that
the
metamorphoses
of
insects
were
known
to
these
savages
but
being
unable
to
talk
with
my
new
friend
i
could
not
ascertain
what
ideas
such
a
phenomenon
had
given
rise
to
in
his
mind
the
good
fellow
did
not
leave
my
side
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
but
thinking
apparently
that
i
had
come
here
for
information
he
put
himself
to
considerable
trouble
to
give
me
all
he
could
he
made
a
quantity
of
hypadu
or
coca
powder
that
i
might
see
the
process
going
about
the
task
with
much
action
and
ceremony
as
though
he
were
a
conjuror
performing
some
wonderful
trick
we
left
these
friendly
people
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
in
descending
the
umbrageous
river
stopped
about
down
at
another
house
built
in
one
of
the
most
charming
situations
i
had
yet
seen
in
this
country
a
clean
narrow
sandy
pathway
led
from
the
shady
port
to
the
house
through
a
tract
of
forest
of
indescribable
luxuriance
the
buildings
stood
on
an
eminence
in
the
middle
of
a
level
cleared
space
the
firm
sand
soil
smooth
as
a
floor
forming
a
broad
terrace
around
them
the
owner
was
a
indian
named
manoel
a
dull
taciturn
fellow
who
together
with
his
wife
and
children
seemed
by
no
means
pleased
at
being
intruded
on
in
their
solitude
the
family
must
have
been
very
industrious
for
the
plantations
were
very
extensive
and
included
a
little
of
almost
all
kinds
of
cultivated
tropical
productions
fruit
trees
vegetables
and
even
flowers
for
ornament
the
silent
old
man
had
surely
a
fine
appreciation
of
the
beauties
of
nature
for
the
site
he
had
chosen
commanded
a
view
of
surprising
magnificence
over
the
summits
of
the
forest
and
to
give
finish
to
the
prospect
he
had
planted
a
large
quantity
of
banana
trees
in
the
foreground
thus
concealing
the
charred
and
dead
stumps
which
would
otherwise
have
marred
the
effect
of
the
rolling
sea
of
greenery
the
only
information
i
could
get
out
of
manoel
was
that
large
flocks
of
birds
came
down
in
the
fruit
season
and
despoiled
his
trees
the
sun
set
over
the
treetops
before
we
left
this
little
eden
and
the
remainder
of
our
journey
was
made
slowly
and
pleasantly
under
the
chequered
shades
of
the
river
banks
by
the
light
of
the
moon
december
arrived
at
fonte
boa
a
wretched
muddy
and
dilapidated
village
situated
two
or
three
miles
within
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
called
the
which
runs
almost
as
straight
as
an
artificial
canal
between
the
village
and
the
main
amazons
the
character
of
the
vegetation
and
soil
here
was
different
from
that
of
all
other
localities
i
had
hitherto
examined
i
had
planned
therefore
to
devote
six
weeks
to
the
place
having
written
beforehand
to
one
of
the
principal
inhabitants
senor
venancio
a
house
was
ready
for
me
on
landing
the
only
recommendation
of
the
dwelling
was
its
coolness
it
was
in
fact
rather
damp
the
plastered
walls
bore
a
crop
of
green
mold
and
a
slimy
moisture
oozed
through
the
black
dirty
floor
the
rooms
were
large
but
lighted
by
miserable
little
holes
in
place
of
windows
the
village
is
built
on
a
clayey
plateau
and
the
ruinous
houses
are
arranged
round
a
large
square
which
is
so
choked
up
with
tangled
bushes
that
it
is
quite
impassable
the
lazy
inhabitants
having
allowed
the
fine
open
space
to
relapse
into
jungle
the
stiff
clayey
eminence
is
worn
into
deep
gullies
which
slope
towards
the
river
and
the
ascent
from
the
port
in
rainy
weather
is
so
slippery
that
one
is
obliged
to
crawl
up
to
the
streets
on
all
fours
a
large
tract
of
round
behind
the
place
is
clear
of
forest
but
this
as
well
as
the
streets
and
gardens
is
covered
with
a
dense
tough
carpet
of
shrubs
having
the
same
wiry
nature
as
our
common
heath
beneath
its
deceitful
covering
the
soil
is
always
moist
and
soft
and
in
the
wet
season
the
whole
is
converted
into
a
glutinous
mud
swamp
there
is
a
very
pretty
church
in
one
corner
of
the
square
but
in
the
rainy
months
of
the
year
nine
out
of
twelve
the
place
of
worship
is
almost
inaccessible
to
the
inhabitants
on
account
of
the
mud
the
only
means
of
getting
to
it
being
by
hugging
closely
the
walls
and
palings
and
so
advancing
sideways
step
by
step
i
remained
in
this
delectable
place
until
the
of
january
fonte
boa
in
addition
to
its
other
amenities
has
the
reputation
throughout
the
country
of
being
the
headquarters
of
mosquitoes
and
it
fully
deserves
the
title
they
are
more
annoying
in
the
houses
by
day
than
by
night
for
they
swarm
in
the
dark
and
damp
rooms
keeping
in
the
daytime
near
the
floor
and
settling
by
together
on
the
legs
at
night
the
calico
tent
is
a
sufficient
protection
but
this
is
obliged
to
be
folded
every
morning
and
in
letting
it
down
before
sunset
great
care
is
required
to
prevent
even
one
or
two
of
the
tormentors
from
stealing
in
beneath
their
insatiable
thirst
for
blood
and
pungent
sting
making
these
enough
to
spoil
all
comfort
in
the
forest
the
plague
is
much
worse
but
the
belongs
to
a
different
species
from
that
of
the
town
being
much
larger
and
having
transparent
wings
it
is
a
little
cloud
that
one
carries
about
one
person
every
step
on
a
woodland
ramble
and
their
hum
is
so
loud
that
it
prevents
one
hearing
well
the
notes
of
birds
the
has
opaque
speckled
wings
a
less
severe
sting
and
a
silent
way
of
going
to
work
the
inhabitants
ought
to
be
thankful
the
big
noisy
fellows
never
come
out
of
the
forest
in
compensation
for
the
abundance
of
mosquitoes
fonte
boa
has
no
piums
there
was
therefore
some
comfort
outside
one
door
in
the
daytime
the
comfort
however
was
lessened
by
their
being
scarcely
any
room
in
front
of
the
house
to
sit
down
or
walk
about
for
on
our
side
of
the
square
the
causeway
was
only
two
feet
broad
and
to
step
over
the
boundary
formed
by
a
line
of
slippery
stems
of
palms
was
to
sink
up
to
the
knees
in
a
sticky
swamp
notwithstanding
damp
and
mosquitoes
i
had
capital
health
and
enjoyed
myself
much
at
fonte
boa
swampy
and
weedy
places
being
generally
more
healthy
than
dry
ones
in
the
amazons
probably
owing
to
the
absence
of
great
radiation
of
heat
from
the
ground
the
forest
was
extremely
rich
and
picturesque
although
the
soil
was
everywhere
clayey
and
cold
and
broad
pathways
threaded
it
for
many
a
mile
over
hill
and
dale
in
every
hollow
flowed
a
sparkling
brook
with
perennial
and
crystal
waters
the
margins
of
these
streams
were
paradises
of
leafiness
and
verdure
the
most
striking
feature
being
the
variety
of
ferns
with
immense
leaves
some
terrestrial
others
climbing
over
trees
and
two
at
least
arborescent
i
saw
here
some
of
the
largest
trees
i
had
yet
seen
there
was
one
especially
a
cedar
whose
colossal
trunk
towered
up
for
more
than
a
hundred
feet
straight
as
an
arrow
i
never
saw
its
crown
which
was
lost
to
view
from
below
beyond
the
crowd
of
lesser
trees
which
surrounded
it
birds
and
monkeys
in
this
glorious
forest
were
very
abundant
the
pithecia
hirsuta
being
the
most
remarkable
of
the
monkeys
and
the
umbrella
chatterer
and
toucans
amongst
the
most
beautiful
of
the
birds
the
indians
and
of
the
village
have
made
their
little
plantations
and
built
huts
for
summer
residence
on
the
banks
of
the
rivulets
and
my
rambles
generally
terminated
at
one
or
other
of
these
places
the
people
were
always
cheerful
and
friendly
and
seemed
to
be
glad
when
i
proposed
to
join
them
at
their
meals
contributing
the
contents
of
my
to
the
dinner
and
squatting
down
among
them
on
the
mat
the
village
was
formerly
a
place
of
more
importance
than
it
now
is
a
great
number
of
indians
belonging
to
the
most
industrious
tribes
shumanas
passes
and
cambevas
having
settled
on
the
site
and
adopted
civilised
habits
their
industry
being
directed
by
a
few
whites
who
seem
to
have
been
men
of
humane
views
as
well
as
enterprising
traders
one
of
these
old
employers
senor
guerreiro
a
paraense
was
still
trading
on
the
amazons
when
i
left
the
country
in
he
told
me
that
forty
years
previously
fonte
boa
was
a
delightful
place
to
live
in
the
neighbourhood
was
then
well
cleared
and
almost
free
from
mosquitoes
and
the
indians
were
orderly
industrious
and
happy
what
led
to
the
ruin
of
the
settlement
was
the
arrival
of
several
portuguese
and
brazilian
traders
of
a
low
class
who
in
their
eagerness
for
business
taught
the
indians
all
kinds
of
trickery
and
immorality
they
enticed
the
men
and
women
away
from
their
old
employers
and
thus
broke
up
the
large
establishments
compelling
the
principals
to
take
their
capital
to
other
places
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
were
few
indians
at
fonte
boa
and
no
true
whites
the
inhabitants
seemed
to
be
nearly
all
mamelucos
and
were
a
rustic
spoken
and
ignorant
set
of
people
there
was
no
priest
or
schoolmaster
within
miles
and
had
not
been
any
for
many
years
the
people
seemed
to
be
almost
without
government
of
any
kind
and
yet
crime
and
deeds
of
violence
appeared
to
be
of
very
rare
occurrence
the
principal
man
of
the
village
one
senor
justo
was
a
big
coarse
energetic
fellow
of
police
and
the
only
tradesman
who
owned
a
large
vessel
running
directly
between
fonte
boa
and
para
he
had
recently
built
a
large
house
in
the
style
of
dwellings
of
towns
namely
with
brick
floors
and
tiled
roof
the
bricks
and
tiles
having
been
brought
from
para
miles
distant
the
nearest
place
where
they
are
manufactured
in
surplus
when
senor
justo
visited
me
he
was
much
struck
with
the
engravings
in
a
file
of
illustrated
london
news
which
lay
on
my
table
it
was
impossible
to
resist
his
urgent
entreaties
to
let
him
have
some
of
them
to
look
at
so
one
day
he
carried
off
a
portion
of
the
papers
on
loan
a
fortnight
afterwards
on
going
to
request
him
to
return
them
i
found
the
engravings
had
been
cut
out
and
stuck
all
over
the
newly
whitewashed
walls
of
his
chamber
many
of
them
upside
down
he
thought
a
room
thus
decorated
with
foreign
views
would
increase
his
importance
among
his
neighbours
and
when
i
yielded
to
his
wish
to
keep
them
was
boundless
in
demonstrations
of
gratitude
ending
by
shipping
a
of
turtles
for
my
use
at
ega
these
neglected
and
rude
villagers
still
retained
many
religious
practices
which
former
missionaries
or
priests
had
taught
them
the
ceremony
which
they
observed
at
christmas
like
that
described
as
practised
by
negroes
in
a
former
chapter
was
very
pleasing
for
its
simplicity
and
for
the
heartiness
with
which
it
was
conducted
the
church
was
opened
dried
and
swept
clean
a
few
days
before
christmas
eve
and
on
the
morning
all
the
women
and
children
of
the
village
were
busy
decorating
it
with
festoons
of
leaves
and
wild
flowers
towards
midnight
it
was
illuminated
inside
and
out
with
little
oil
lamps
made
of
clay
and
the
image
of
the
menino
deus
or
in
its
cradle
was
placed
below
the
altar
which
was
lighted
up
with
rows
of
wax
candles
very
lean
ones
but
the
best
the
poor
people
could
afford
all
the
villagers
assembled
soon
afterwards
dressed
in
their
best
he
women
with
flowers
in
their
hair
and
a
few
simple
hymns
totally
irrelevant
to
the
occasion
but
probably
the
only
ones
known
by
them
were
sung
kneeling
an
old
with
spotted
face
leading
off
the
tunes
this
finished
the
congregation
rose
and
then
marched
in
single
file
up
one
side
of
the
church
and
down
the
other
singing
together
a
very
pretty
marching
chorus
and
each
one
on
reaching
the
little
image
stooping
to
kiss
the
end
of
a
ribbon
which
was
tied
round
its
waist
considering
that
the
ceremony
was
got
up
of
their
own
free
will
and
at
considerable
expense
i
thought
it
spoke
well
for
the
good
intentions
and
simplicity
of
heart
of
these
poor
neglected
villagers
i
left
fonte
boa
for
ega
on
the
of
january
making
the
passage
by
steamer
down
the
middle
of
the
current
in
sixteen
hours
the
sight
of
the
clean
and
neat
little
town
with
its
open
spaces
grass
broad
lake
and
white
sandy
shores
had
a
most
exhilarating
effect
after
my
trip
into
the
wilder
parts
of
the
country
the
district
between
ega
and
loreto
the
first
peruvian
village
on
the
river
is
indeed
the
most
remote
and
barbarous
of
the
whole
line
of
the
amazons
from
ocean
to
ocean
beyond
loreto
signs
of
civilisation
from
the
side
of
the
pacific
begin
to
be
numerous
and
from
ega
downwards
the
improvement
is
felt
from
the
side
of
the
atlantic
september
again
embarked
on
the
tabatinga
this
time
for
a
longer
excursion
than
the
last
namely
to
paulo
de
olivenca
a
village
higher
up
than
any
i
had
yet
visited
being
miles
distant
in
a
straight
line
from
ega
or
about
miles
following
the
bends
of
the
river
the
waters
were
now
nearly
at
their
lowest
point
but
this
made
no
difference
to
the
rate
of
travelling
night
or
day
several
of
the
parana
mirims
or
which
the
steamer
threads
in
the
season
of
to
save
a
long
circuit
were
now
dried
up
their
empty
beds
looking
like
deep
sandy
ravines
in
the
midst
of
the
thick
forest
the
large
and
miles
of
sandy
beach
were
also
uncovered
and
these
with
the
swarms
of
large
aquatic
birds
storks
herons
ducks
waders
and
which
lined
their
margins
in
certain
places
made
the
river
view
much
more
varied
and
animated
than
it
is
in
the
season
of
the
flood
alligators
of
large
size
were
common
near
the
shores
lazily
floating
and
heedless
of
the
passing
steamer
the
passengers
amused
themselves
by
shooting
at
them
from
the
deck
with
a
rifle
we
had
on
board
the
sign
of
a
mortal
hit
was
the
monster
turning
suddenly
over
and
remaining
floating
with
its
white
belly
upwards
lieutenant
nunes
wished
to
have
one
of
the
dead
animals
on
board
for
the
purpose
of
opening
the
abdomen
and
if
a
male
extracting
a
part
which
is
held
in
great
estimation
among
brazilians
as
a
remedio
charm
or
medicine
the
steamer
was
stopped
and
a
boat
sent
with
four
strong
men
to
embark
the
beast
the
body
however
was
found
too
heavy
to
be
lifted
into
the
boat
so
a
rope
was
passed
round
it
and
the
hideous
creature
towed
alongside
and
hoisted
on
deck
by
means
of
the
crane
which
was
rigged
for
the
purpose
it
had
still
some
sparks
of
life
and
when
the
knife
was
applied
lashed
its
tail
and
opened
its
enormous
jaws
sending
the
crowd
of
bystanders
flying
in
all
directions
a
blow
with
a
hatchet
on
the
crown
of
the
head
gave
him
his
quietus
at
last
the
length
of
the
animal
was
fifteen
feet
but
this
statement
can
give
but
an
imperfect
idea
of
its
immense
bulk
and
weight
the
numbers
of
turtles
which
were
seen
swimming
in
quiet
shoaly
bays
passed
on
the
road
also
gave
us
much
amusement
they
were
seen
by
dozens
ahead
with
their
snouts
peering
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
on
the
steamer
approaching
turning
round
to
stare
but
not
losing
confidence
till
the
vessel
had
nearly
passed
when
they
appeared
to
be
suddenly
smitten
with
distrust
diving
like
ducks
under
the
stream
we
had
on
board
among
our
a
indian
of
the
juri
tribe
a
short
thickset
man
with
features
resembling
much
those
of
the
late
daniel
his
name
was
black
eagle
and
his
countenance
seemed
permanently
twisted
into
a
grim
smile
the
effect
of
which
was
heightened
by
the
tattooed
marks
a
blue
rim
to
the
mouth
with
a
diagonal
pointed
streak
from
each
corner
towards
the
ear
he
was
dressed
in
black
hat
coat
and
trousers
looking
very
uncomfortable
in
the
dreadful
heat
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
exists
on
board
a
steamer
under
a
vertical
sun
during
day
hours
this
indian
was
a
man
of
steady
resolution
ambitious
and
enterprising
very
rare
qualities
in
the
race
to
which
he
belonged
weakness
of
resolution
being
one
of
the
fundamental
defects
in
the
indian
character
he
was
now
on
his
return
home
to
the
banks
of
the
issa
from
para
whither
he
had
been
to
sell
a
large
quantity
of
sarsaparilla
that
he
had
collected
with
the
help
of
a
number
of
indians
whom
he
induces
or
forces
to
work
for
him
one
naturally
feels
inclined
to
know
what
ideas
such
a
favourable
specimen
of
the
indian
race
may
have
acquired
after
so
much
experience
amongst
civilised
scenes
on
conversing
with
our
i
was
greatly
disappointed
in
him
he
had
seen
nothing
and
thought
of
nothing
beyond
what
concerned
his
little
trading
speculation
his
mind
being
evidently
what
it
had
been
before
with
regard
to
all
higher
subjects
or
general
ideas
a
blank
the
dull
mean
practical
way
of
thinking
of
the
amazonian
indians
and
the
absence
of
curiosity
and
speculative
thought
which
seems
to
be
organic
or
confirmed
in
their
character
although
they
are
improvable
to
a
certain
extent
make
them
like
commonplace
people
everywhere
most
uninteresting
companions
disembarked
at
tunantins
with
his
cargo
which
consisted
of
a
considerable
number
of
packages
of
european
wares
the
river
scenery
about
the
mouth
of
the
japura
is
extremely
grand
and
was
the
subject
of
remark
among
the
passengers
lieutenant
nunes
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
there
was
no
diminution
of
width
or
grandeur
in
the
mighty
stream
up
to
this
point
a
distance
of
miles
from
the
atlantic
and
yet
we
did
not
here
see
the
two
shores
of
the
river
on
both
sides
at
once
lines
of
islands
or
tracts
of
alluvial
land
having
in
the
rear
intercepting
the
view
of
the
northern
mainland
and
sometimes
also
of
the
southern
beyond
the
issa
however
the
river
becomes
evidently
narrower
being
reduced
to
an
average
width
of
about
a
mile
there
were
then
no
longer
those
magnificent
reaches
with
blank
horizons
which
occur
lower
down
we
had
a
dark
and
rainy
night
after
passing
tunantins
and
the
passengers
were
all
very
uneasy
on
account
of
the
speed
at
which
we
were
travelling
twelve
miles
an
hour
with
every
plank
vibrating
with
the
force
of
the
engines
many
of
them
could
not
sleep
myself
among
the
number
at
length
a
little
after
midnight
a
sudden
shout
startled
us
back
her
english
terms
being
used
in
matters
relating
to
the
pilot
instantly
sprung
to
the
helm
and
in
a
few
moments
we
felt
our
brushing
against
the
wall
of
forest
into
which
we
had
nearly
driven
headlong
fortunately
the
water
was
deep
close
up
to
the
bank
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
september
we
anchored
in
the
port
of
paulo
after
five
days
quick
travelling
from
ega
paulo
is
built
on
a
high
hill
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
river
the
hill
is
formed
of
the
same
tabatinga
clay
which
occurs
at
intervals
over
the
whole
valley
of
the
amazons
but
nowhere
rises
to
so
great
an
elevation
as
here
the
height
being
about
feet
above
the
mean
level
of
the
river
the
ascent
from
the
port
is
steep
and
slippery
steps
and
have
been
made
to
lighten
the
fatigue
of
mounting
otherwise
the
village
would
be
almost
inaccessible
especially
to
porters
of
luggage
and
cargo
for
there
are
no
means
of
making
a
circuitous
road
of
more
moderate
slope
the
hill
being
steep
on
all
sides
and
surrounded
by
dense
forests
and
swamps
the
place
contains
about
inhabitants
chiefly
and
indians
of
the
tucuna
and
collina
tribes
who
are
very
little
improved
from
their
primitive
state
the
streets
are
narrow
and
in
rainy
weather
inches
deep
in
mud
many
houses
are
of
substantial
structure
but
in
a
ruinous
condition
and
the
place
altogether
presents
the
appearance
like
fonte
boa
of
having
seen
better
days
signs
of
commerce
such
as
meet
the
eye
at
ega
could
scarcely
be
expected
in
this
remote
spot
situate
miles
or
seven
months
round
voyage
by
from
para
the
nearest
market
for
produce
a
very
short
experience
showed
that
the
inhabitants
were
utterly
debased
the
few
portuguese
and
other
immigrants
having
instead
of
promoting
industry
adopted
the
lazy
mode
of
life
of
the
indians
spiced
with
the
practice
of
a
few
strong
vices
of
their
own
introduction
the
of
the
village
senor
antonio
ribeiro
prepared
a
house
for
me
on
landing
and
introduced
me
to
the
principal
people
the
summit
of
the
hill
is
grassy
of
two
or
three
hundred
acres
in
extent
the
soil
is
not
wholly
clay
but
partly
sand
and
gravel
the
village
itself
however
stands
chiefly
on
clay
and
the
streets
therefore
after
heavy
rains
become
filled
with
muddy
puddles
on
damp
nights
the
chorus
of
frogs
and
toads
which
swarm
in
weedy
creates
such
a
bewildering
uproar
that
it
is
impossible
to
carry
on
a
conversation
indoors
except
by
shouting
my
house
was
damper
even
than
the
one
i
occupied
at
fonte
boa
and
this
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
keep
my
collections
from
being
spoilt
by
mould
but
the
general
humidity
of
the
atmosphere
in
this
part
of
the
river
was
evidently
much
greater
than
it
is
lower
down
it
appears
to
increase
gradually
in
ascending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
andes
it
was
impossible
at
paulo
to
keep
salt
for
many
days
in
a
solid
state
which
was
not
the
case
at
ega
when
the
baskets
in
which
it
is
contained
were
well
wrapped
in
leaves
six
degrees
further
westward
namely
at
the
foot
of
the
andes
the
dampness
of
the
climate
of
the
amazonian
forest
region
appears
to
reach
its
acme
for
poeppig
found
at
chinchao
that
the
most
refined
sugar
in
a
few
days
dissolved
into
syrup
and
the
best
gunpowder
became
liquid
even
when
enclosed
in
canisters
at
paulo
refined
sugar
kept
pretty
well
in
tin
boxes
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
keeping
my
gunpowder
dry
in
canisters
although
a
gun
loaded
overnight
could
very
seldom
be
fired
off
in
the
morning
the
principal
residents
at
paulo
were
the
priest
a
white
from
para
who
spent
his
days
and
most
of
his
nights
in
gambling
and
corrupting
the
young
fellows
and
setting
the
vilest
example
to
the
indians
the
an
upright
and
loyal
negro
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
senor
jose
patricio
the
juiz
de
paz
a
named
geraldo
and
lastly
senor
antonio
ribeiro
who
was
director
of
the
indians
geraldo
and
ribeiro
were
my
near
neighbours
but
they
took
offence
at
me
after
the
first
few
days
because
i
would
not
join
them
in
their
drinking
bouts
which
took
place
about
every
third
day
they
used
to
begin
early
in
the
morning
with
cashaca
mixed
with
grated
ginger
a
powerful
drink
which
used
to
excite
them
almost
to
madness
neighbour
geraldo
after
these
morning
potations
used
to
station
himself
opposite
my
house
and
rave
about
foreigners
gesticulating
in
a
threatening
manner
towards
me
by
the
hour
after
becoming
sober
in
the
evening
he
usually
came
to
offer
me
the
humblest
apologies
driven
to
it
i
believe
by
his
wife
he
himself
being
quite
unconscious
of
this
breach
of
good
manners
the
wives
of
the
paulo
worthies
however
were
generally
as
bad
as
their
husbands
nearly
all
the
women
being
hard
drinkers
and
corrupt
to
the
last
degree
wifebeating
naturally
flourished
under
such
a
state
of
things
i
found
it
always
best
to
lock
myself
indoors
after
sunset
and
take
no
notice
of
the
thumps
and
screams
which
used
to
rouse
the
village
in
different
quarters
throughout
the
night
especially
at
festival
times
the
only
companionable
man
i
found
in
the
place
except
jose
patricio
who
was
absent
most
part
of
the
time
was
the
negro
tailor
of
the
village
a
tall
thin
grave
young
man
named
mestre
chico
master
frank
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
at
para
several
years
previously
he
was
a
free
negro
by
birth
but
had
had
the
advantage
of
kind
treatment
in
his
younger
days
having
been
brought
up
by
a
humane
and
sensible
man
one
captain
basilio
of
pernambuco
his
padrinho
or
godfather
he
neither
drank
smoked
nor
gambled
and
was
thoroughly
disgusted
at
the
depravity
of
all
classes
in
this
wretched
little
settlement
which
he
intended
to
quit
as
soon
as
possible
when
he
visited
me
at
night
he
used
to
knock
at
my
shutters
in
a
manner
we
had
agreed
on
it
being
necessary
to
guard
against
admitting
drunken
neighbours
and
we
then
spent
the
long
evenings
most
pleasantly
working
and
conversing
his
manners
were
courteous
and
his
talk
well
worth
listening
to
for
the
shrewdness
and
good
sense
of
his
remarks
i
first
met
mestre
chico
at
the
house
of
an
old
negress
of
para
tia
rufina
aunt
rufina
who
used
to
take
charge
of
my
goods
when
i
was
absent
on
a
voyage
and
this
affords
me
an
opportunity
of
giving
a
few
further
instances
of
the
excellent
qualities
of
free
negroes
in
a
country
where
they
are
not
wholly
condemned
to
a
degrading
position
by
the
pride
or
selfishness
of
the
white
race
this
old
woman
was
born
a
slave
but
like
many
others
in
the
large
towns
of
brazil
she
had
been
allowed
to
trade
on
her
own
account
as
paying
a
fixed
sum
daily
to
her
owner
and
keeping
for
herself
all
her
surplus
gains
in
a
few
years
she
had
saved
sufficient
money
to
purchase
her
freedom
and
that
of
her
up
son
this
done
the
old
lady
continued
to
strive
until
she
had
earned
enough
to
buy
the
house
in
which
she
lived
a
considerable
property
situated
in
one
of
the
principal
streets
when
i
returned
from
the
interior
after
seven
years
absence
from
para
i
found
she
was
still
advancing
in
prosperity
entirely
through
her
own
exertions
being
a
widow
and
those
of
her
son
who
continued
with
the
most
regular
industry
his
trade
as
blacksmith
and
was
now
building
a
number
of
small
houses
on
a
piece
of
unoccupied
land
attached
to
her
property
i
found
these
and
many
other
free
negroes
most
trustworthy
people
and
admired
the
constancy
of
their
friendships
and
the
gentleness
and
cheerfulness
of
their
manners
towards
each
other
they
showed
great
disinterestedness
in
their
dealings
with
me
doing
me
many
a
piece
of
service
without
a
hint
at
remuneration
but
this
may
have
been
partly
due
to
the
name
of
englishman
the
knowledge
of
our
national
generosity
towards
the
african
race
being
spread
far
and
wide
amongst
the
brazilian
negroes
i
remained
at
paulo
five
months
five
years
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
exhaust
the
treasures
of
its
neighbourhood
in
zoology
and
botany
although
now
a
of
ten
experience
the
beautiful
forest
which
surrounds
this
settlement
gave
me
as
much
enjoyment
as
if
i
had
only
just
landed
for
the
first
time
in
a
tropical
country
the
plateau
on
which
the
village
is
built
extends
on
one
side
nearly
a
mile
into
the
forest
but
on
the
other
side
the
descent
into
the
lowland
begins
close
to
the
streets
the
hill
sloping
abruptly
towards
a
boggy
meadow
surrounded
by
woods
through
which
a
narrow
winding
path
continues
the
slope
down
to
a
cool
shady
glen
with
a
brook
of
water
flowing
at
the
bottom
at
the
vertical
sun
penetrates
into
the
gloomy
depths
of
this
romantic
spot
lighting
up
the
leafy
banks
of
the
rivulet
and
its
clean
sandy
margins
where
numbers
of
scarlet
green
and
black
tanagers
and
coloured
butterflies
sport
about
in
the
stray
beams
sparkling
brooks
large
and
small
traverse
the
glorious
forest
in
almost
every
direction
and
one
is
constantly
meeting
while
rambling
through
the
thickets
with
trickling
rills
and
bubbling
springs
so
is
the
country
with
moisture
some
of
the
rivulets
flow
over
a
sandy
and
pebbly
bed
and
the
banks
of
all
are
clothed
with
the
most
magnificent
vegetation
conceivable
i
had
the
almost
daily
habit
in
my
solitary
walks
of
resting
on
the
clean
banks
of
these
streams
and
bathing
for
an
hour
at
a
time
in
their
bracing
waters
hours
which
now
remain
among
my
most
pleasant
memories
the
broad
forest
roads
continue
as
i
was
told
a
distance
of
several
days
journey
into
the
interior
which
is
peopled
by
tucunas
and
other
indians
living
in
scattered
houses
and
villages
nearly
in
their
primitive
state
the
nearest
village
lying
about
six
miles
from
paulo
the
banks
of
all
the
streams
are
dotted
with
dwellings
of
tucunas
all
in
the
leafy
wilderness
the
scattered
families
having
chosen
the
coolest
and
shadiest
nooks
for
their
abodes
i
frequently
heard
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
huts
the
realejo
or
organ
bird
cyphorhinus
cantans
the
most
remarkable
songster
by
far
of
the
amazonian
forests
when
its
singular
notes
strike
the
ear
for
the
first
time
the
impression
can
not
be
resisted
that
they
are
produced
by
a
human
voice
some
musical
boy
must
be
gathering
fruit
in
the
thickets
and
is
singing
a
few
notes
to
cheer
himself
the
tones
become
more
fluty
and
plaintive
they
are
now
those
of
a
flageolet
and
notwithstanding
the
utter
impossibility
of
the
thing
one
is
for
the
moment
convinced
that
somebody
is
playing
that
instrument
no
bird
is
to
be
seen
however
closely
the
surrounding
trees
and
bushes
may
be
scanned
and
yet
the
voice
seems
to
come
from
the
thicket
close
to
one
ears
the
ending
of
the
song
is
rather
disappointing
it
begins
with
a
few
very
slow
and
mellow
notes
following
each
other
like
the
commencement
of
an
air
one
listens
expecting
to
hear
a
complete
strain
but
an
abrupt
pause
occurs
and
then
the
song
breaks
down
finishing
with
a
number
of
clicking
unmusical
sounds
like
a
piping
barrel
organ
out
of
wind
and
tune
i
never
heard
the
bird
on
the
lower
amazon
and
very
rarely
heard
it
even
at
ega
it
is
the
only
songster
which
makes
an
impression
on
the
natives
who
sometimes
rest
their
paddles
whilst
travelling
in
their
small
canoes
along
the
shady
streams
as
if
struck
by
the
mysterious
sounds
the
tucuna
indians
are
a
tribe
resembling
much
the
shumanas
passes
juris
and
mauhes
in
their
physical
appearance
and
customs
they
lead
like
those
tribes
a
settled
agricultural
life
each
horde
obeying
a
chief
of
more
or
less
influence
according
to
his
energy
and
ambition
and
possessing
its
paje
or
who
fosters
its
superstitions
but
they
are
much
more
idle
and
debauched
than
other
indians
belonging
to
the
superior
tribes
they
are
not
so
warlike
and
loyal
as
the
mundurucus
although
resembling
them
in
many
respects
nor
have
they
the
slender
figures
dignified
mien
and
gentle
disposition
of
the
passes
there
are
however
no
trenchant
points
of
difference
to
distinguish
them
from
these
highest
of
all
the
tribes
both
men
and
women
are
tattooed
the
pattern
being
sometimes
a
scroll
on
each
cheek
but
generally
rows
of
short
straight
lines
on
the
face
most
of
the
older
people
wear
bracelets
anklets
and
garters
of
or
tough
bark
in
their
homes
they
wear
no
other
dress
except
on
festival
days
when
they
ornament
themselves
with
feathers
or
masked
cloaks
made
of
the
inner
bark
of
a
tree
they
were
very
shy
when
i
made
my
first
visits
to
their
habitations
in
the
forest
all
scampering
off
to
the
thicket
when
i
approached
but
on
subsequent
days
they
became
more
familiar
and
i
found
them
a
harmless
people
a
great
part
of
the
horde
living
at
the
first
maloca
or
village
dwell
in
a
common
habitation
a
large
oblong
hut
built
and
arranged
inside
with
such
a
disregard
of
all
symmetry
that
it
appeared
as
though
constructed
by
a
number
of
hands
each
working
independently
stretching
a
rafter
or
fitting
in
a
piece
of
thatch
without
reference
to
what
his
were
doing
the
walls
as
well
as
the
roof
are
covered
with
thatch
of
palm
leaves
each
piece
consisting
of
leaflets
plaited
and
attached
in
a
row
to
a
lath
many
feet
in
length
strong
upright
posts
support
the
roof
hammocks
being
slung
between
them
leaving
a
free
space
for
passage
and
for
fires
in
the
middle
and
on
one
side
is
an
elevated
stage
girao
overhead
formed
of
split
the
tucunas
excel
over
most
of
the
other
tribes
in
the
manufacture
of
pottery
they
make
jars
for
tucupi
sauce
caysuma
or
mandioca
beer
capable
of
holding
twenty
or
more
gallons
ornamenting
them
outside
with
crossed
diagonal
streaks
of
various
colours
these
jars
with
smaller
jars
for
holding
water
quivers
matiri
bags
these
bags
are
formed
of
remarkably
neat
twine
made
of
bromelia
fibres
elaborately
knitted
all
in
one
piece
with
sticks
a
belt
of
the
same
material
but
more
closely
woven
being
attached
to
the
top
to
suspend
them
by
they
afford
good
examples
of
the
mechanical
ability
of
these
indians
the
tucunas
also
possess
the
art
of
skinning
and
stuffing
birds
the
handsome
kinds
of
which
they
sell
in
great
numbers
to
passing
travellers
full
of
small
articles
baskets
skins
of
animals
and
so
forth
form
the
principal
part
of
the
furniture
of
their
huts
both
large
and
small
the
dead
bodies
of
their
chiefs
are
interred
the
knees
doubled
up
in
large
jars
under
the
floors
of
their
huts
the
dances
and
drinking
bouts
usual
among
the
settled
tribes
of
amazonian
indians
are
indulged
in
to
greater
excess
by
the
tucunas
than
they
are
by
most
other
tribes
the
jurupari
or
demon
is
the
only
superior
being
they
have
any
conception
of
and
his
name
is
mixed
up
with
all
their
ceremonies
but
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
what
they
consider
to
be
his
attributes
he
seems
to
be
believed
in
simply
as
a
mischievous
imp
who
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
those
mishaps
of
their
daily
life
the
causes
of
which
are
not
very
immediate
or
obvious
to
their
dull
understandings
it
is
vain
to
try
to
get
information
out
of
a
tucuna
on
this
subject
they
affect
great
mystery
when
the
name
is
mentioned
and
give
very
confused
answers
to
questions
it
was
clear
however
that
the
idea
of
a
spirit
as
a
beneficent
god
or
creator
had
not
entered
the
minds
of
these
indians
there
is
great
similarity
in
all
their
ceremonies
and
mummeries
whether
the
object
is
a
wedding
the
celebration
of
the
feast
of
fruits
the
plucking
of
the
hair
from
the
heads
of
their
children
or
a
holiday
got
up
simply
out
of
a
love
of
dissipation
some
of
the
tribe
on
these
occasions
deck
themselves
with
the
feathers
of
parrots
and
macaws
the
chief
wears
a
headdress
or
cap
made
by
fixing
the
of
the
toucan
on
a
web
of
bromelia
twine
with
erect
tail
plumes
of
macaws
rising
from
the
crown
the
cinctures
of
the
arms
and
legs
are
also
then
ornamented
with
bunches
of
feathers
others
wear
masked
dresses
these
are
long
cloaks
reaching
below
the
knee
and
made
of
the
thick
inner
bark
of
a
tree
the
fibres
of
which
are
interlaced
in
so
regular
a
manner
that
the
material
looks
like
artificial
cloth
the
cloak
covers
the
head
two
holes
are
cut
out
for
the
eyes
a
large
round
piece
of
the
cloth
stretched
on
a
rim
of
flexible
wood
is
stitched
on
each
side
to
represent
cars
and
the
features
are
painted
in
exaggerated
style
with
yellow
red
and
black
streaks
the
dresses
are
sewn
into
the
proper
shapes
with
thread
made
of
the
inner
bark
of
the
uaissima
tree
sometimes
grotesque
representing
monkeys
busts
or
heads
of
other
animals
made
by
stretching
cloth
or
skin
over
a
basketwork
frame
are
worn
at
these
holidays
the
biggest
and
ugliest
mask
represents
the
jurupari
in
these
festival
habiliments
the
tucunas
go
through
their
monotonous
and
stamping
dances
accompanied
by
singing
and
drumming
and
keep
up
the
sport
often
for
three
or
four
days
and
nights
in
succession
drinking
enormous
quantities
of
caysuma
smoking
tobacco
and
snuffing
parica
powder
i
could
not
learn
that
there
was
any
deep
symbolical
meaning
in
these
masked
dances
or
that
they
commemorated
any
past
event
in
the
history
of
the
tribe
some
of
them
seem
vaguely
intended
as
a
propitiation
of
the
jurupari
but
the
masker
who
represents
the
demon
sometimes
gets
drunk
along
with
the
rest
and
is
not
treated
with
any
reverence
from
all
i
could
make
out
these
indians
preserve
no
memory
of
events
going
beyond
the
times
of
their
fathers
or
grandfathers
almost
every
joyful
event
is
made
the
occasion
of
a
festival
weddings
among
the
best
a
young
man
who
wishes
to
wed
a
tucuna
girl
has
to
demand
her
hand
of
her
parents
who
arrange
the
rest
of
the
affair
and
fix
a
day
for
the
marriage
ceremony
a
wedding
which
took
place
in
the
christmas
week
while
i
was
at
paulo
was
kept
up
with
great
spirit
for
three
or
four
days
flagging
during
the
heats
of
day
but
renewing
itself
with
increased
vigour
every
evening
during
the
whole
time
the
bride
decked
out
with
feather
ornaments
was
under
the
charge
of
the
older
squaws
whose
business
seemed
to
be
sedulously
to
keep
the
bridegroom
at
a
safe
distance
until
the
end
of
the
dreary
period
of
dancing
and
boosing
the
tucunas
have
the
singular
custom
in
common
with
the
collinas
and
mauhes
of
treating
their
young
girls
on
their
showing
the
first
signs
of
womanhood
as
if
they
had
committed
some
crime
they
are
sent
up
to
the
girao
under
the
smoky
and
filthy
roof
and
kept
there
on
very
meagre
diet
sometimes
for
a
whole
month
i
heard
of
one
poor
girl
dying
under
this
treatment
the
only
other
tribe
of
this
neighbourhood
concerning
which
i
obtained
any
information
were
the
majeronas
whose
territory
embraces
several
hundred
miles
of
the
western
bank
of
the
river
jauari
an
affluent
of
the
solimoens
miles
beyond
paulo
these
are
a
fierce
indomitable
and
hostile
people
like
the
araras
of
the
river
madeira
they
are
also
cannibals
the
navigation
of
the
jauari
is
rendered
impossible
on
account
of
the
majeronas
lying
in
wait
on
its
banks
to
intercept
and
murder
all
travellers
especially
whites
four
months
before
my
arrival
at
paulo
two
young
nearly
white
of
the
village
went
to
trade
on
the
jauari
the
majeronas
having
shown
signs
of
abating
their
hostility
for
a
year
or
two
previously
they
had
not
been
long
gone
when
their
canoe
returned
with
the
news
that
the
two
young
fellows
had
been
shot
with
arrows
roasted
and
eaten
by
the
savages
jose
patricio
with
his
usual
activity
in
the
cause
of
law
and
order
despatched
a
party
of
armed
men
of
the
national
guard
to
the
place
to
make
inquiries
and
if
the
murder
should
appear
to
be
unprovoked
to
retaliate
when
they
reached
the
settlement
of
the
horde
who
had
eaten
the
two
men
it
was
found
evacuated
with
the
exception
of
one
girl
who
had
been
in
the
woods
when
the
rest
of
her
people
had
taken
flight
and
whom
the
guards
brought
with
them
to
paulo
it
was
gathered
from
her
and
from
other
indians
on
the
jauari
that
the
young
men
had
brought
their
fate
on
themselves
through
improper
conduct
towards
the
majerona
women
the
girl
on
arriving
at
paulo
was
taken
care
of
by
senor
jose
patricio
baptised
under
the
name
of
maria
and
taught
portuguese
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
her
for
my
friend
sent
her
daily
to
my
house
to
fill
the
make
the
fire
and
so
forth
i
also
gained
her
goodwill
by
extracting
the
grub
of
an
oestrus
fly
from
her
back
and
thus
cured
her
of
a
painful
tumour
she
was
decidedly
the
and
to
all
appearance
the
specimen
of
her
race
i
had
yet
seen
she
was
tall
and
very
stout
in
colour
much
lighter
than
the
ordinary
indian
tint
and
her
ways
altogether
were
more
like
those
of
a
careless
laughing
country
wench
such
as
might
be
met
with
any
day
amongst
the
labouring
class
in
villages
in
our
own
country
than
a
cannibal
i
heard
this
artless
maiden
relate
in
the
coolest
manner
possible
how
she
ate
a
portion
of
the
bodies
of
the
young
men
whom
her
tribe
had
roasted
but
what
increased
greatly
the
incongruity
of
this
business
the
young
widow
of
one
of
the
victims
a
neighbour
of
mine
happened
to
be
present
during
the
narrative
and
showed
her
interest
in
it
by
laughing
at
the
broken
portuguese
in
which
the
girl
related
the
horrible
story
in
the
fourth
month
of
my
sojourn
at
paulo
i
had
a
serious
illness
an
attack
of
the
sizoens
or
ague
of
the
country
which
as
it
left
me
with
shattered
health
and
damped
enthusiasm
led
to
my
abandoning
the
plan
i
had
formed
of
proceeding
to
the
peruvian
towns
of
pebas
and
moyobamba
and
miles
further
west
and
so
completing
the
examination
of
the
natural
history
of
the
amazonian
plains
up
to
the
foot
of
the
andes
i
made
a
very
large
collection
at
paulo
and
employed
a
collector
at
tabatinga
and
on
the
banks
of
the
jauari
for
several
months
so
that
i
acquired
a
very
fair
knowledge
altogether
of
the
productions
of
the
country
bordering
the
amazons
to
the
end
of
the
brazilian
territory
a
distance
of
miles
from
the
atlantic
at
the
mouth
of
the
para
but
beyond
the
peruvian
boundary
i
found
now
i
should
be
unable
to
go
my
ague
seemed
to
be
the
culmination
of
a
gradual
deterioration
of
health
which
had
been
going
on
for
several
years
i
had
exposed
myself
too
much
in
the
sun
working
to
the
utmost
of
my
strength
six
days
a
week
and
had
suffered
much
besides
from
bad
and
insufficient
food
the
ague
did
not
exist
at
paulo
but
the
foul
and
humid
state
of
the
village
was
perhaps
sufficient
to
produce
ague
in
a
person
much
weakened
from
other
causes
the
country
bordering
the
shores
of
the
solimoens
is
healthy
throughout
some
endemic
diseases
certainly
exist
but
these
are
not
of
a
fatal
nature
and
the
epidemics
which
desolated
the
lower
amazons
from
para
to
the
rio
negro
between
the
years
and
had
never
reached
this
favoured
land
ague
is
known
only
on
the
banks
of
those
tributary
streams
which
have
water
i
always
carried
a
stock
of
medicines
with
me
and
a
small
phial
of
quinine
which
i
had
bought
at
para
in
but
never
yet
had
use
for
now
came
in
very
useful
i
took
for
each
dose
as
much
as
would
lie
on
the
tip
of
a
mixing
it
with
warm
camomile
tea
the
first
few
days
after
my
first
attack
i
could
not
stir
and
was
delirious
during
the
paroxysms
of
fever
but
the
worst
being
over
i
made
an
effort
to
rouse
myself
knowing
that
incurable
disorders
of
the
liver
and
spleen
follow
ague
in
this
country
if
the
feeling
of
lassitude
is
too
much
indulged
so
every
morning
i
shouldered
my
gun
or
and
went
my
usual
walk
in
the
forest
the
fit
of
shivering
very
often
seized
me
before
i
got
home
and
i
then
used
to
stand
still
and
brave
it
out
when
the
steamer
ascended
in
january
lieutenant
nunes
was
shocked
to
see
me
so
much
shattered
and
recommended
me
strongly
to
return
at
once
to
ega
i
took
his
advice
and
embarked
with
him
when
he
touched
at
paulo
on
his
downward
voyage
on
the
of
february
i
still
hoped
to
be
able
to
turn
my
face
westward
again
to
gather
the
yet
unseen
treasures
of
the
marvellous
countries
lying
between
tabatinga
and
the
slopes
of
the
andes
but
although
after
a
short
rest
in
ega
the
ague
left
me
my
general
health
remained
in
a
state
too
weak
to
justify
the
undertaking
of
further
journeys
at
length
i
left
ega
on
the
of
february
en
route
for
england
i
arrived
at
para
on
the
of
march
after
an
absence
in
the
interior
of
seven
years
and
a
half
my
old
friends
english
american
and
brazilian
scarcely
knew
me
again
but
all
gave
me
a
very
warm
welcome
especially
brocklehurst
of
the
firm
of
singlehurst
and
the
chief
foreign
merchants
who
had
been
my
correspondents
who
received
me
into
his
house
and
treated
me
with
the
utmost
kindness
i
was
rather
surprised
at
the
warm
appreciation
shown
by
many
of
the
principal
people
of
my
labours
but
in
fact
the
interior
of
the
country
is
still
the
sertao
wilderness
a
terra
incognita
to
most
residents
of
the
seaport
and
a
man
who
had
spent
seven
years
and
a
half
in
exploring
it
solely
with
scientific
aims
was
somewhat
of
a
curiosity
i
found
para
greatly
changed
and
improved
it
was
no
longer
the
weedy
ruinous
place
that
it
appeared
to
be
when
i
first
knew
it
in
the
population
had
been
increased
to
by
an
influx
of
portuguese
madeiran
and
german
immigrants
and
for
many
years
past
the
provincial
government
had
spent
their
considerable
surplus
revenue
in
beautifying
the
city
the
streets
formerly
unpaved
or
strewn
with
loose
stones
and
sand
were
now
laid
with
concrete
in
a
most
complete
manner
all
the
projecting
masonry
of
the
built
houses
had
been
cleared
away
and
the
buildings
made
more
uniform
most
of
the
dilapidated
houses
were
replaced
by
handsome
new
edifices
having
long
and
elegant
balconies
fronting
the
first
floors
at
an
elevation
of
several
feet
above
the
roadway
the
large
swampy
squares
had
been
drained
weeded
and
planted
with
rows
of
almond
and
casuarina
trees
so
that
they
were
now
a
great
ornament
to
the
city
instead
of
an
eyesore
as
they
formerly
were
my
old
favourite
road
the
monguba
avenue
had
been
renovated
and
joined
to
many
other
magnificent
rides
lined
with
trees
which
in
a
very
few
years
had
grown
to
a
height
sufficient
to
afford
agreeable
shade
one
of
these
the
estrada
de
sao
jose
had
been
planted
with
palms
sixty
public
vehicles
light
cabriolets
some
of
them
built
in
para
now
plied
in
the
streets
increasing
much
the
animation
of
the
beautified
squares
streets
and
avenues
i
found
also
the
habits
of
the
people
considerably
changed
many
of
the
old
religious
holidays
had
declined
in
importance
and
given
way
to
secular
amusements
social
parties
balls
music
billiards
and
so
forth
there
was
quite
as
much
pleasure
seeking
as
formerly
but
it
was
turned
in
a
more
rational
direction
and
the
paraenses
seemed
now
to
copy
rather
the
customs
of
the
northern
nations
of
europe
than
those
of
the
mother
country
portugal
i
was
glad
to
see
several
new
booksellers
shops
and
also
a
fine
edifice
devoted
to
a
supplied
with
periodicals
globes
and
maps
and
a
circulating
library
there
were
now
many
and
four
daily
newspapers
the
health
of
the
place
had
greatly
improved
since
the
year
of
the
yellow
fever
and
para
was
now
considered
no
longer
dangerous
to
newcomers
so
much
for
the
improvements
visible
in
the
place
and
now
for
the
dark
side
of
the
picture
the
expenses
of
living
had
increased
about
fourfold
a
natural
consequence
of
the
demand
for
labour
and
for
native
products
of
all
kinds
having
augmented
in
greater
ratio
than
the
supply
through
large
arrivals
of
nonproductive
residents
and
considerable
importations
of
money
on
account
of
the
steamboat
company
and
foreign
merchants
para
in
was
one
of
the
cheapest
places
of
residence
on
the
american
continent
it
was
now
one
of
the
dearest
imported
articles
of
food
clothing
and
furniture
were
mostly
cheaper
although
charged
with
duties
varying
from
to
percent
besides
high
freights
and
large
profits
than
those
produced
in
the
neighbourhood
salt
codfish
was
twopence
per
pound
cheaper
than
the
vile
salt
pirarucu
of
the
country
oranges
which
could
formerly
be
had
almost
gratis
were
now
sold
in
the
streets
at
the
rate
of
three
for
a
penny
large
bananas
were
a
penny
each
tomatoes
were
from
two
to
three
pence
each
and
all
other
fruits
in
this
country
had
advanced
in
like
proportion
the
bread
of
the
country
had
become
so
scarce
and
dear
and
bad
that
the
poorer
classes
of
natives
suffered
famine
and
all
who
could
afford
it
were
obliged
to
eat
wheaten
bread
at
fourpence
to
fivepence
per
pound
made
from
american
flour
barrels
of
which
were
consumed
monthly
this
was
now
therefore
a
very
serious
item
of
daily
expense
to
all
but
the
most
wealthy
house
rent
was
most
exorbitant
a
miserable
little
place
of
two
rooms
without
fixtures
or
conveniences
of
any
kind
having
simply
blank
walls
cost
at
the
rate
of
sterling
a
year
lastly
the
hire
of
servants
was
beyond
the
means
of
all
persons
in
moderate
circumstances
a
lazy
cook
or
porter
could
not
be
had
for
less
than
three
or
four
shillings
a
day
besides
his
board
and
what
he
could
steal
it
cost
me
for
the
hire
of
a
small
boat
and
one
man
to
disembark
from
the
steamer
a
distance
of
yards
in
rambling
over
my
old
ground
in
the
forests
of
the
neighbourhood
i
found
great
changes
had
taken
place
to
me
changes
for
the
worse
the
mantle
of
shrubs
bushes
and
creeping
plants
which
formerly
when
the
suburbs
were
undisturbed
by
axe
or
spade
had
been
left
free
to
arrange
itself
in
rich
full
and
smooth
sheets
and
masses
over
the
forest
borders
had
been
nearly
all
cut
away
and
troops
of
labourers
were
still
employed
cutting
ugly
muddy
roads
for
carts
and
cattle
through
the
once
clean
and
lonely
woods
houses
and
mills
had
been
erected
on
the
borders
of
these
new
roads
the
noble
had
been
cut
down
and
their
naked
stems
remained
in
the
midst
of
ashes
muddy
puddles
and
heaps
of
broken
branches
i
was
obliged
to
hire
a
negro
boy
to
show
me
the
way
to
my
favourite
path
near
una
which
i
have
described
in
the
second
chapter
of
this
narrative
the
new
clearings
having
quite
obliterated
the
old
forest
roads
only
a
few
acres
of
the
glorious
forest
near
una
now
remained
in
their
natural
state
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
near
the
old
road
to
the
rice
mills
several
scores
of
woodsmen
were
employed
under
government
in
cutting
a
broad
through
the
forest
to
maranham
the
capital
of
the
neighbouring
province
distant
miles
from
para
and
this
had
entirely
destroyed
the
solitude
of
the
grand
old
forest
path
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
however
a
new
growth
of
creepers
will
cover
the
naked
treetrunks
on
the
borders
of
this
new
road
and
luxuriant
shrubs
form
a
green
fringe
to
the
path
it
will
then
become
as
beautiful
a
woodland
road
as
the
old
one
was
a
naturalist
will
have
henceforward
to
go
farther
from
the
city
to
find
the
glorious
forest
scenery
which
lay
so
near
in
and
work
much
more
laboriously
than
was
formerly
needed
to
make
the
large
collections
which
wallace
and
i
succeeded
in
doing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
para
june
at
length
on
the
of
june
i
left
para
probably
forever
embarking
in
a
north
american
the
frederick
demming
for
new
york
the
united
states
route
being
the
quickest
as
well
as
the
pleasantest
way
of
reaching
england
my
extensive
private
collections
were
divided
into
three
portions
and
sent
by
three
separate
ships
to
lessen
the
risk
of
loss
of
the
whole
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
i
took
a
last
view
of
the
glorious
forest
for
which
i
had
so
much
love
and
to
explore
which
i
had
devoted
so
many
years
the
saddest
hours
i
ever
recollect
to
have
spent
were
those
of
the
succeeding
night
when
the
mameluco
pilot
having
left
us
free
of
the
shoals
and
out
of
sight
of
land
though
within
the
mouth
of
the
river
at
anchor
waiting
for
the
wind
i
felt
that
the
last
link
which
connected
me
with
the
land
of
so
many
pleasing
recollections
was
broken
the
paraenses
who
are
fully
aware
of
the
attractiveness
of
their
country
have
an
alliterative
proverb
quem
vai
para
o
para
para
he
who
goes
to
para
stops
there
and
i
had
often
thought
i
should
myself
have
been
added
to
the
list
of
examples
the
desire
however
of
seeing
again
my
parents
and
enjoying
once
more
the
rich
pleasures
of
intellectual
society
had
succeeded
in
overcoming
the
attractions
of
a
region
which
may
be
fittingly
called
a
naturalist
paradise
during
this
last
night
on
the
para
river
a
crowd
of
unusual
thoughts
occupied
my
mind
recollections
of
english
climate
scenery
and
modes
of
life
came
to
me
with
a
vividness
i
had
never
before
experienced
during
the
eleven
years
of
my
absence
pictures
of
startling
clearness
rose
up
of
the
gloomy
winters
the
long
grey
twilights
murky
atmosphere
elongated
shadows
chilly
springs
and
sloppy
summers
of
factory
chimneys
and
crowds
of
grimy
operatives
rung
to
work
in
early
morning
by
factory
bells
of
union
workhouses
confined
rooms
artificial
cares
and
slavish
conventionalities
to
live
again
amidst
these
dull
scenes
i
was
quitting
a
country
of
perpetual
summer
where
my
life
had
been
spent
like
that
of
of
the
people
in
gipsy
fashion
on
the
endless
streams
or
in
the
boundless
forests
i
was
leaving
the
equator
where
the
forces
of
nature
maintained
a
surface
and
climate
that
seemed
to
be
typical
of
mundane
order
and
beauty
to
sail
towards
the
north
pole
where
lay
my
home
under
crepuscular
skies
somewhere
about
degrees
of
latitude
it
was
natural
to
feel
a
little
dismayed
at
the
prospect
of
so
great
a
change
but
now
after
three
years
of
renewed
experience
of
england
i
find
how
incomparably
superior
is
civilised
life
where
feelings
tastes
and
intellect
find
abundant
nourishment
to
the
spiritual
sterility
of
existence
even
though
it
be
passed
in
the
garden
of
eden
what
has
struck
me
powerfully
is
the
immeasurably
greater
diversity
and
interest
of
human
character
and
social
conditions
in
a
single
civilised
nation
than
in
equatorial
south
america
where
three
distinct
races
of
man
live
together
the
superiority
of
the
bleak
north
to
tropical
regions
however
is
only
in
their
social
aspect
for
i
hold
to
the
opinion
that
although
humanity
can
reach
an
advanced
state
of
culture
only
by
battling
with
the
inclemencies
of
nature
in
high
latitudes
it
is
under
the
equator
alone
that
the
perfect
race
of
the
future
will
attain
to
complete
fruition
of
man
beautiful
heritage
the
earth
the
following
day
having
no
wind
we
drifted
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
para
with
the
current
of
fresh
water
that
is
poured
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
in
hours
advanced
in
this
way
seventy
miles
on
our
road
on
the
of
june
when
in
lat
and
w
and
therefore
about
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
main
amazons
we
passed
numerous
patches
of
floating
grass
mingled
with
and
withered
foliage
among
these
masses
i
espied
many
fruits
of
that
peculiarly
amazonian
tree
the
ubussu
palm
this
was
the
last
i
saw
of
the
great
river
