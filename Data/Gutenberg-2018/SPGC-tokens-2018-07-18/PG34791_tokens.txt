the
song
of
songs
part
i
chapter
i
lilly
was
fourteen
years
old
when
her
father
kilian
czepanek
the
suddenly
disappeared
it
happened
in
this
way
he
had
been
giving
piano
lessons
the
whole
day
in
the
interim
swearing
and
drinking
moselle
and
selters
for
it
was
intensely
hot
occasionally
he
had
slipped
into
the
to
take
a
cognac
or
arrange
his
windsor
necktie
he
had
pulled
lilly
brown
curls
as
she
sat
labouring
over
her
french
vocabulary
and
had
disappeared
again
into
the
best
room
where
the
girl
pupils
changed
from
hour
to
hour
and
only
the
dissonances
and
the
curses
remained
when
the
last
victim
had
stumbled
through
her
lesson
and
closed
the
hall
door
behind
her
czepanek
failed
to
reappear
in
his
usual
bad
temper
and
with
his
usual
appetite
he
remained
in
the
front
room
where
this
day
he
neither
whistled
nor
whined
nor
played
out
his
rage
on
the
keyboard
as
he
sometimes
did
after
a
day
labour
in
fact
he
gave
scarcely
a
sign
of
life
now
and
then
a
deep
sigh
that
was
all
lilly
who
took
warm
interest
in
everything
her
handsome
father
did
or
did
not
do
let
her
french
textbook
slip
from
her
lap
and
stole
up
to
the
keyhole
through
it
she
saw
him
standing
before
the
large
absorbed
in
a
close
study
of
himself
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
left
hand
and
pressed
it
as
if
in
despair
against
his
soft
silky
dark
curls
which
lilly
mother
devotedly
fostered
every
day
with
and
french
oils
he
and
his
reflection
gazed
at
each
other
moist
red
face
with
wild
eager
eyes
and
lilly
heart
expanded
in
love
of
her
adored
papa
to
lilly
his
standing
before
the
mirror
was
a
familiar
sight
it
was
his
manner
of
squaring
accounts
for
his
lost
life
and
wasted
love
his
manner
of
charming
back
the
great
world
in
which
duchesses
and
prima
donnas
yearningly
cherished
the
memory
of
their
vanished
idol
he
stood
there
like
an
elderly
god
of
love
with
small
alcoholic
puffs
under
his
eyes
and
a
tendency
toward
a
paunch
both
mama
and
lilly
cared
for
him
with
unremitting
zeal
they
regarded
him
as
a
sort
of
bird
of
paradise
who
by
a
lucky
chance
had
been
caught
between
the
walls
of
a
room
and
who
required
the
greatest
effort
the
utmost
circumspection
to
keep
him
safe
in
the
cage
by
right
lilly
should
long
ago
have
been
sitting
at
the
piano
for
in
the
house
of
czepanek
a
quiet
keyboard
was
a
waste
of
time
and
a
sin
before
the
lord
she
had
to
practice
four
or
five
hours
every
day
often
when
her
father
was
seized
by
the
holy
spirit
of
creativeness
and
forgot
the
time
set
aside
for
her
practicing
she
did
not
begin
until
nearly
midnight
then
she
sat
at
the
piano
frozen
with
heavy
eyes
striking
out
in
all
directions
until
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
sometimes
her
mother
found
her
the
next
day
lying
with
her
arms
crossed
on
the
keyboard
in
that
profound
child
sleep
from
which
there
is
almost
no
rousing
thus
it
happened
that
she
cared
little
for
the
artistic
future
for
which
her
father
ambition
had
destined
her
she
preferred
to
dally
with
some
old
forbidden
book
and
often
drove
her
father
to
despair
by
a
false
pretence
at
cleverness
in
playing
at
first
sight
but
she
had
the
sonata
pathétique
to
do
and
there
is
no
trifling
with
that
as
any
babe
in
arms
knows
so
she
was
just
about
to
interrupt
her
father
as
he
stood
there
plunged
in
dreamy
when
she
heard
a
click
at
the
door
from
the
kitchen
she
bounded
away
from
the
keyhole
with
one
great
leap
of
her
long
legs
and
the
next
instant
her
mother
entered
carrying
the
supper
dishes
the
mother
prematurely
faded
cheeks
were
now
glowing
from
the
heat
of
the
kitchen
fire
she
held
her
lean
figure
erect
taut
as
a
whip
cord
which
seemed
to
be
tied
in
a
knot
at
the
abdomen
by
a
protrusion
the
result
of
abortive
dull
marital
sorrow
had
long
ago
transformed
her
eyes
once
beautiful
into
two
lustreless
slits
but
at
this
moment
they
were
beaming
with
pride
and
expectation
for
czepanek
hoped
to
satisfy
her
lord
and
his
palate
at
the
clatter
of
the
plates
on
the
table
the
door
to
the
parlour
opened
and
papa
dark
curly
head
about
which
the
evening
sunlight
cast
a
halo
appeared
in
the
bright
opening
the
deuce
supper
already
he
said
and
his
eyes
wandered
with
a
peculiar
confused
gaze
in
ten
minutes
the
mother
replied
joy
at
the
surprise
in
store
for
him
playing
about
her
parched
chapped
lips
like
secret
bliss
he
entered
the
room
took
a
few
deep
breaths
and
said
with
the
air
of
a
man
to
whom
speech
comes
hard
i
just
noticed
that
one
of
the
straps
of
my
is
torn
why
do
you
want
it
asked
his
wife
one
must
always
be
kept
in
readiness
he
answered
his
eyes
continuing
to
rove
about
the
room
suppose
i
were
suddenly
to
be
called
to
act
as
substitute
somewhere
i
must
have
my
bag
ready
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
been
called
upon
the
previous
winter
to
take
the
place
of
a
berlin
virtuoso
who
had
undertaken
to
do
the
towns
in
eastern
germany
and
whose
train
had
been
near
bromberg
the
committee
telegraphed
to
papa
requesting
him
to
play
in
his
stead
but
now
in
midsummer
when
the
concert
season
was
dead
such
an
emergency
was
scarcely
within
the
realm
of
the
possible
i
tell
minna
to
take
it
to
the
saddler
right
after
supper
said
mama
who
took
good
care
not
to
contradict
her
choleric
husband
he
nodded
meditatively
and
walked
into
his
bedroom
while
the
mother
ran
to
the
kitchen
to
do
the
final
honours
in
her
own
person
to
the
titbit
she
had
prepared
for
him
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
with
the
bag
in
his
hand
it
looked
rather
bulgy
he
stopped
before
the
linen
chest
lilly
dear
he
said
i
wonder
whether
the
score
would
go
into
the
grip
crosswise
in
case
i
am
called
to
a
concert
you
know
the
score
of
the
song
of
songs
was
kept
in
the
linen
chest
so
that
should
fire
break
out
during
papa
absence
anyone
in
the
family
might
easily
get
at
this
greatest
of
treasures
lilly
looked
for
the
keys
but
could
not
find
them
i
go
ask
mama
she
said
no
no
he
cried
hastily
and
a
shiver
went
through
his
body
such
as
lilly
had
often
noticed
when
mother
was
mentioned
to
him
i
first
take
this
old
thing
to
the
saddler
lilly
was
shocked
at
the
idea
that
her
celebrated
father
should
himself
go
to
the
saddler
dingy
workshop
mercy
she
cried
and
reached
out
for
the
handle
of
the
bag
she
would
take
it
to
the
saddler
herself
but
he
warded
her
off
you
too
grown
up
now
for
such
things
my
girl
he
said
and
his
eyes
lighted
up
as
they
scanned
her
tall
virginal
body
her
hips
and
bosom
already
beginning
to
show
delicate
curves
why
you
almost
a
he
patted
her
cheeks
and
pulled
a
little
at
the
lock
of
the
linen
chest
gnawing
his
lips
the
while
in
intense
bitterness
then
suddenly
he
shook
himself
and
with
a
shy
contemptuous
look
toward
the
kitchen
lilly
knew
that
look
too
went
quickly
out
of
the
room
he
went
and
never
came
back
the
night
following
that
red
summer
evening
remained
graven
in
memory
hour
by
hour
her
mother
sat
on
the
in
her
nightgown
and
her
fervid
anxious
eyes
kept
glancing
up
and
down
the
street
whenever
she
heard
steps
at
a
distance
knocking
on
the
pavement
she
would
start
and
cry
there
he
is
lilly
felt
there
was
no
need
to
bother
about
the
pathétique
a
dull
oppression
in
her
left
breast
determined
her
to
turn
to
joseph
to
whom
she
had
stood
in
tender
relations
since
her
confirmation
she
had
already
passed
many
a
dreamy
idle
hour
before
his
altar
at
anne
right
front
second
chapel
and
secretly
sent
up
many
an
abstract
sigh
to
the
dear
good
face
with
the
beautiful
beard
but
he
failed
her
utterly
she
could
get
no
consolation
from
him
and
vexed
and
disillusioned
she
dismissed
him
at
twelve
the
last
vehicle
passed
the
house
at
one
the
pedestrians
too
grew
less
frequent
at
two
a
dusty
wind
arose
smelling
of
sand
and
threatening
to
blow
out
the
lamp
between
two
and
three
only
the
night
watchman
was
heard
shuffling
along
the
narrow
echoing
street
at
three
the
early
delivery
wagons
began
to
rattle
and
it
grew
light
between
three
and
four
lilly
prepared
a
boiling
hot
cup
of
coffee
for
her
mother
and
ate
up
all
the
cold
supper
long
waiting
and
crying
had
made
her
ravenously
hungry
between
four
and
five
a
band
of
young
night
revellers
passed
by
throwing
kisses
to
her
mother
and
when
their
importunities
forced
her
to
withdraw
from
the
window
they
serenaded
her
fine
pure
voices
lilly
had
to
admit
despite
her
grief
rendition
good
and
precise
without
that
pedantic
effect
which
papa
so
detested
in
the
singing
societies
perhaps
they
were
even
pupils
of
his
who
did
not
know
his
residence
scarcely
were
they
gone
when
the
mother
was
again
at
her
post
lilly
struggled
against
sleep
she
saw
as
through
a
veil
the
thin
blond
hair
waving
over
her
forehead
in
the
morning
breeze
saw
the
pointed
nose
red
with
weeping
turn
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
according
to
the
direction
from
which
a
sound
came
saw
the
nightgown
fluttering
like
a
white
flag
and
the
lean
legs
incessantly
rubbing
against
each
other
in
nervous
agitation
then
she
had
to
retell
perhaps
for
the
hundredth
time
the
story
of
the
and
the
linen
chest
but
her
eyes
closed
and
then
suddenly
she
started
up
with
a
cry
her
mother
had
dropped
back
in
a
swoon
and
lay
supine
on
the
floor
like
a
log
of
wood
chapter
ii
so
kilian
czepanek
never
came
back
good
friends
were
not
wanting
of
course
who
had
for
years
foreseen
the
event
in
fact
they
failed
to
understand
how
he
could
have
endured
it
so
long
he
the
man
of
genius
of
fancy
with
the
of
creative
restlessness
on
his
brow
others
called
him
a
a
dirty
scoundrel
who
ran
after
innocent
girls
and
enticed
young
men
to
gamble
they
declared
czepanek
lucky
to
be
rid
of
him
and
charged
lilly
to
erase
her
unworthy
father
from
her
memory
most
unpleasant
of
all
however
were
those
who
said
nothing
but
presented
bills
czepanek
sold
or
pawned
all
the
articles
of
luxury
left
her
from
the
comfort
of
her
youth
or
from
her
husband
liberal
moods
but
these
soon
gave
out
furniture
dress
and
linen
not
absolutely
indispensable
followed
then
at
last
the
creditors
were
stilled
the
singing
society
to
the
leadership
of
which
kilian
czepanek
had
been
called
fifteen
years
before
and
which
during
that
period
had
carried
off
no
less
than
six
prizes
expressed
its
satisfaction
with
the
accomplishments
of
its
conductor
by
holding
the
position
open
for
half
a
year
and
paying
the
salary
in
full
to
his
wife
but
this
period
of
grace
also
came
to
an
end
now
began
the
bitter
begging
pilgrimages
to
the
eminent
citizens
and
officials
of
the
city
the
sorry
pulling
of
bells
the
anxious
scraping
of
shoes
before
strangers
doors
the
waitings
in
dark
corridors
the
abashed
sitting
down
on
the
narrow
edges
of
chairs
the
sighs
the
stammering
the
wiping
of
eyes
which
however
honestly
meant
came
to
have
somewhat
the
appearance
of
professional
hypocrisy
the
more
it
was
calculated
to
produce
an
impression
the
more
it
failed
of
its
purpose
now
came
the
chase
for
work
in
shop
and
factory
in
all
places
where
and
shirts
and
nightgowns
are
made
where
cheap
lace
is
added
to
cheap
underwear
where
white
goods
is
vitalised
with
hems
and
yokes
and
bindings
and
strings
now
came
the
whizz
of
the
sewing
machine
the
whole
day
and
the
whole
night
now
came
pricked
fingers
inflamed
eyes
swollen
knees
vinegar
compresses
about
feverish
temples
a
simmering
at
four
in
the
morning
watery
coffee
heated
three
times
over
with
bread
and
butter
instead
of
the
midday
roast
and
the
evening
eggs
in
short
now
came
poverty
and
strange
to
say
the
more
remote
the
day
on
which
kilian
czepanek
had
disappeared
the
more
confidently
his
abandoned
wife
looked
forward
to
his
return
the
first
half
year
had
passed
another
conductor
appeared
and
challenged
comparison
for
a
couple
of
weeks
the
papers
contented
themselves
with
mortifying
him
by
flattering
allusions
to
the
former
leader
but
this
also
passed
and
now
followed
the
great
silence
of
the
grave
at
most
czepanek
picture
remained
alive
only
in
a
few
and
a
few
girls
hearts
czepanek
however
who
had
so
long
compressed
her
lips
in
smothered
shame
when
the
conversation
turned
upon
her
husband
began
to
speak
of
his
coming
back
as
of
an
established
fact
definitely
prearranged
more
than
that
she
who
in
the
course
of
fifteen
years
had
gradually
lost
her
youth
her
beauty
her
ready
wit
and
laughter
everything
she
had
brought
as
a
marriage
dowry
to
her
husband
sinking
it
for
no
reason
at
all
in
a
grey
pool
of
and
anxiety
she
who
for
many
years
had
not
tried
a
coloured
ribbon
on
her
sunken
breast
who
had
not
troubled
to
arrange
a
lock
of
hair
on
her
forehead
which
kept
growing
higher
and
higher
this
woman
became
vain
again
each
time
she
received
her
meagre
pay
she
made
haste
to
invest
part
of
it
in
powder
and
beauty
creams
in
moments
of
exhaustion
when
she
could
no
longer
stand
on
her
feet
she
quickly
whipped
a
red
stick
from
her
pocket
and
passed
it
over
her
thin
lips
and
about
eight
every
morning
she
bustled
between
the
kitchen
fire
and
the
sewing
machine
with
a
freshly
burned
wreath
of
curls
in
this
way
she
prepared
herself
for
his
return
she
would
receive
her
repentant
husband
in
her
outstretched
arms
bedecked
and
radiant
as
a
bride
for
he
was
bound
to
return
that
was
certain
where
else
would
he
find
a
comprehending
smile
like
hers
where
else
the
secret
which
consoles
by
silence
and
compels
happiness
by
prayer
which
with
the
dropping
of
the
rosary
beads
secretly
insinuates
dreamy
stipulations
with
providence
and
dissolves
the
whole
universe
into
one
great
minor
harmony
of
yearning
where
else
was
there
a
human
being
who
served
as
she
did
without
malice
and
without
regret
with
body
and
with
soul
who
allowed
herself
to
be
taken
or
rejected
according
to
impulse
or
desire
thus
she
had
once
welcomed
him
a
young
blond
laughing
unsuspecting
thing
she
had
given
herself
to
him
without
stint
and
without
questioning
just
because
he
desired
it
and
she
had
scarcely
felt
it
as
her
right
and
his
atonement
when
he
led
her
to
the
altar
at
the
command
of
her
father
an
honest
subordinate
in
a
court
of
justice
in
fact
czepanek
had
been
forced
into
marriage
by
half
the
city
which
otherwise
would
have
ostracised
the
seducer
and
ousted
him
from
his
soft
berth
happier
she
could
not
be
that
she
knew
of
the
nameless
misfortune
bound
to
come
she
had
not
the
least
presentiment
and
when
it
came
she
took
it
without
complaint
she
loved
him
so
very
much
she
regarded
it
as
the
natural
indemnity
for
the
unnatural
gift
of
having
possessed
him
yet
he
would
come
back
in
spite
of
all
whether
he
wished
to
or
not
he
would
come
she
had
in
her
possession
a
pledge
which
chained
him
to
her
for
all
time
and
which
sooner
or
later
must
force
him
to
cross
her
threshold
it
was
not
lilly
true
he
loved
his
child
loved
her
with
a
tenderness
strangely
compounded
of
pleasure
in
a
toy
for
idle
hours
and
of
aesthetic
delight
in
her
inner
and
outer
loveliness
but
for
a
real
father
love
she
knew
there
was
no
room
in
his
gypsy
heart
even
in
hours
when
he
would
feel
himself
most
alone
and
abandoned
the
thought
would
never
occur
to
him
to
seek
solace
and
comfort
with
a
child
of
his
but
the
wife
had
something
else
in
her
keeping
which
gave
her
a
far
stronger
hold
upon
him
a
roll
of
music
that
was
all
he
might
easily
have
put
it
in
the
bag
with
which
he
had
departed
on
his
great
journey
in
fact
he
had
attempted
to
but
so
great
at
the
decisive
moment
was
his
desire
to
escape
that
he
did
not
dare
to
face
his
suspicious
wife
this
roll
of
music
contained
everything
that
had
linked
his
past
with
his
future
during
the
fifteen
years
of
his
philistine
life
everything
remaining
from
the
titanic
storm
and
stress
of
his
youth
from
the
giddy
hopes
and
ambitions
of
the
days
when
he
starved
this
roll
of
music
it
was
slender
enough
contained
the
work
of
his
life
it
contained
the
song
of
songs
since
lilly
could
think
nothing
in
the
world
had
been
spoken
of
with
such
respect
with
such
tender
and
reverent
awe
as
this
work
of
which
with
the
exception
of
the
two
women
no
one
knew
a
note
it
was
something
that
had
never
yet
been
something
unheard
of
a
new
world
of
sound
the
beginning
of
a
musical
development
of
which
the
end
was
lost
in
the
twilight
of
mystic
anticipation
the
opera
had
reached
its
culmination
in
wagner
the
road
from
which
pointed
straight
down
into
the
abyss
symphonic
composition
no
longer
answered
modern
requirements
for
sense
music
the
song
had
been
split
up
by
the
newest
school
into
a
series
of
small
subtle
effects
the
art
of
the
future
belonged
to
the
oratorio
but
not
that
constrained
wooden
production
hitherto
suffered
to
pass
by
the
name
from
a
false
belief
that
we
have
to
make
concessions
to
a
misunderstood
ecclesiasticism
but
and
here
it
was
that
the
new
world
of
sound
the
song
of
songs
began
the
score
had
been
completed
years
ago
to
entrust
it
to
the
heavy
execution
of
the
musicians
of
czepanek
provincial
town
would
have
been
desecration
so
it
lay
there
and
lay
there
and
interwove
the
day
with
a
mild
mysterious
light
which
no
one
saw
yet
every
one
felt
it
shot
rays
of
light
into
the
distant
future
and
so
filled
a
palpitating
heart
with
anticipation
prayer
and
love
that
that
heart
would
rather
have
stood
still
than
exist
without
this
fountain
of
the
good
and
the
noble
from
which
the
acting
forces
of
life
daily
drew
their
sustenance
for
lilly
the
roll
of
music
lying
in
the
upper
drawer
of
the
linen
chest
held
together
by
two
rubber
bands
was
a
kind
of
household
divinity
which
gave
purity
and
sanctity
to
the
home
she
had
imbibed
reverence
for
the
sheets
of
paper
scrawled
over
with
runes
since
the
dawn
of
her
recollections
and
their
music
was
familiar
to
her
from
her
early
childhood
papa
it
is
true
did
not
like
to
have
the
themes
of
his
creation
bandied
about
in
everyday
life
why
do
you
sing
du
lieber
augustin
or
sei
bedankt
mein
lieber
schwan
he
used
to
say
when
he
caught
one
of
them
dreamily
humming
his
arias
they
are
plenty
good
enough
for
you
later
his
warnings
grew
unnecessary
mama
gradually
forgot
everything
sounding
like
a
song
and
lilly
withdrew
more
and
more
into
herself
she
had
arranged
a
sort
of
mass
from
the
song
of
songs
which
she
celebrated
before
the
mirror
when
she
knew
she
was
alone
in
the
house
she
draped
a
sheet
about
her
waist
like
a
skirt
hung
over
her
shoulders
wound
old
lace
about
her
neck
and
wove
spangles
taken
from
shoes
into
her
hair
singing
weeping
and
uttering
shouts
of
joy
with
genuflections
magic
dances
and
airy
embraces
she
lived
through
sulamith
bridal
yearning
and
ecstasy
as
awakened
to
life
again
in
papa
song
of
songs
after
a
slumber
of
hundred
years
the
manuscript
of
this
song
became
the
anchor
to
which
the
hopes
of
kilian
czepanek
family
were
henceforth
fastened
it
was
conceivable
that
he
a
vagabond
cast
out
by
his
own
parents
when
a
child
might
abandon
wife
and
daughter
to
want
and
pining
but
to
believe
that
he
would
desert
the
work
of
his
lifetime
the
sword
wherewith
he
was
to
fight
his
way
back
into
the
great
world
was
sheer
folly
and
while
the
whizzed
and
whirred
day
and
night
in
the
attic
to
which
czepanek
and
her
daughter
had
removed
while
the
body
of
the
forsaken
woman
dried
up
entirely
and
grew
ever
more
deformed
and
the
layer
of
paint
with
which
she
kept
herself
young
rested
upon
cheekbones
sharpening
from
week
to
week
there
lay
in
the
upper
drawer
of
the
linen
chest
the
chest
had
been
saved
from
bankruptcy
an
earnest
of
future
reunion
working
miracles
by
its
proximity
the

chapter
iii
lilly
was
now
a
tall
young
woman
with
a
figure
for
her
age
who
carried
her
through
the
streets
with
the
air
of
a
princess
her
plaid
dress
of
mixed
wool
was
always
wrinkled
by
rain
and
despite
the
tucks
was
ever
too
short
her
boots
went
to
the
cobbler
time
and
again
and
between
the
wavy
ends
of
her
cotton
gloves
and
the
hems
of
her
sleeves
laboriously
stretched
to
meet
them
gleamed
a
strip
of
red
slender
arm
but
whoever
saw
her
come
down
the
street
with
the
easy
swing
of
her
beautifully
curved
hips
with
the
careless
rhythmic
tread
of
exuberant
youth
and
strength
with
the
mobile
head
too
small
for
her
tall
body
set
on
a
long
neck
with
the
two
mouse
teeth
that
looked
out
eagerly
from
behind
an
upper
lip
somewhat
too
short
and
with
the
two
famous
lilly
eyes
he
who
saw
her
did
not
think
of
the
shabbiness
of
her
dress
did
not
suspect
that
this
delicately
shaped
broad
breast
was
bent
for
hours
and
hours
over
sewing
that
this
whole
glorious
youthful
organism
whose
sap
as
it
chased
through
her
veins
manifested
itself
in
causeless
blushings
and
passionate
palings
was
grandly
maintained
and
preserved
on
boiled
potatoes
bread
spread
with
clarified
fat
and
bad
sausage
the
high
school
students
followed
her
all
afire
and
for
a
long
time
the
poems
composed
in
her
praise
in
the
first
year
class
were
to
be
counted
by
the
dozen
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
remained
indifferent
to
their
homage
when
a
troop
of
them
came
toward
her
on
the
street
she
felt
as
if
a
rosy
veil
were
descending
over
her
eyes
from
shame
and
dread
and
when
the
young
men
passed
by
doffing
their
caps
they
had
met
her
at
the
she
was
overcome
by
giddiness
or
a
sinking
sensation
so
suddenly
did
the
blood
mount
to
her
head
the
aftertaste
of
the
meetings
was
delicious
for
hours
she
recalled
the
picture
of
the
young
man
who
had
greeted
her
most
respectfully
or
the
one
who
had
blushed
like
herself
that
was
the
one
she
loved
until
at
the
next
encounter
he
was
replaced
by
another
despite
her
adorers
she
was
subjected
to
less
teasing
by
her
schoolmates
than
is
usual
in
such
cases
the
contented
defencelessness
of
her
manner
disarmed
all
enmity
if
they
hid
her
she
merely
entreated
please
give
it
back
to
me
if
they
stuck
her
up
on
the
stove
she
remained
there
laughing
and
if
they
wanted
to
copy
her
english
exercise
she
gave
them
the
solution
to
an
arithmetic
problem
besides
the
only
discord
in
her
relations
with
them
arose
from
the
jealousy
that
set
her
bosom
friends
by
the
ears
in
this
she
was
not
quite
blameless
as
she
changed
her
friendships
with
startling
rapidity
feeling
in
duty
bound
to
respond
to
all
overtures
of
intimacy
consequently
her
affections
could
not
be
fastened
on
a
single
companion
for
long
and
she
herself
was
amazed
when
she
saw
one
sentiment
pushed
aside
by
the
next
attack
the
teachers
too
had
kindly
feelings
for
her
the
words
lilly
you
are
dreaming
which
sometimes
came
from
the
platform
sounded
more
like
a
caress
than
a
reproach
as
head
of
the
newcomers
in
the
b
class
she
sat
for
a
time
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
row
and
more
than
one
hand
gave
her
hair
a
paternal
stroke
in
passing
her
nickname
was
lilly
with
the
eyes
her
schoolmates
declared
such
eyes
were
absolutely
improbable
such
eyes
not
exist
cat
eyes
nixie
eyes
are
samples
of
the
epithets
bestowed
upon
them
some
maintained
they
were
violet
some
knew
for
sure
she
penciled
her
lids
however
that
may
be
he
who
looked
at
her
face
saw
eyes
and
nothing
but
eyes
and
was
content
to
look
no
further
when
fifteen
and
a
half
years
old
lilly
passed
from
the
class
into
the
selecta
the
class
for
advanced
pupils
for
it
had
been
decided
that
she
was
to
earn
her
living
as
a
governess
with
this
came
a
change
in
many
respects
new
teachers
new
subjects
of
study
new
companions
and
a
new
tone
in
intercourse
nobody
was
addressed
by
the
first
name
the
throwing
of
paper
balls
ceased
and
no
one
on
going
home
found
bits
of
paper
stuck
in
her
hair
phrases
like
sacredness
of
a
vocation
and
consecration
of
life
were
cheapened
by
repetition
but
so
also
were
love
episodes
and
secret
betrothals
for
the
first
time
lilly
experienced
a
slight
feeling
of
envy
she
was
neither
engaged
nor
did
the
least
love
affair
come
her
way
such
trivialities
as
anonymous
bouquets
or
verses
bearing
the
superscription
thine
forever
with
two
initial
letters
intertwined
were
of
course
not
to
be
counted
but
her
time
came
her
love
was
compounded
of
marble
statues
and
temple
pillars
of
evergreen
cypresses
and
a
sky
eternally
blue
of
pity
and
yearning
for
the
of
a
pupil
adoration
for
her
teacher
and
of
a
desire
to
save
he
was
assistant
instructor
in
science
in
the
girls
high
school
and
taught
in
the
lower
grades
where
the
ruler
is
still
used
on
knuckles
and
tongues
are
stuck
out
behind
the
teacher
back
in
revenge
he
gave
no
instruction
whatever
in
the
higher
classes
but
delivered
lectures
on
the
history
of
art
to
the
selecta
history
of
art
the
very
words
are
enough
to
send
a
shiver
of
ecstasy
through
a
maiden
soul
how
much
greater
the
charm
when
a
suffering
young
man
with
burning
eyes
and
a
forehead
expounds
the
subject
his
first
name
was
arpad
but
there
the
romance
ended
what
remained
was
a
poor
consumptive
who
had
painfully
earned
his
way
through
the
university
by
private
tutoring
only
to
fall
a
victim
to
the
grave
just
when
he
had
hoped
to
reap
the
scant
fruit
of
the
sufferings
of
his
youth
his
superiors
helped
him
to
the
extent
of
their
ability
they
assigned
him
the
easiest
classes
and
as
soon
as
they
noticed
the
fever
stains
burning
on
his
cheeks
they
obtained
a
substitute
in
his
place
and
sent
him
home
but
they
succeeded
in
securing
only
a
short
respite
during
which
the
dying
man
became
a
burden
to
the
teaching
staff
feeling
this
himself
he
put
forth
suicidal
energy
to
disarm
whatever
criticism
might
be
made
against
his
ability
to
work
he
eagerly
assumed
all
possible
duties
in
his
line
and
what
the
most
industrious
and
ambitious
man
found
too
difficult
he
who
stood
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
with
no
career
ahead
of
him
gladly
took
upon
his
shoulders
the
day
the
principal
introduced
him
to
the
selecta
remained
fixed
in
lilly
memory
it
was
between
three
and
four
the
last
hour
when
the
almighty
principal
portly
belly
unexpectedly
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
entered
followed
by
the
slender
young
man
with
a
slight
stoop
who
stood
at
miss
hennig
right
side
during
morning
services
in
the
main
hall
and
the
pages
of
his
while
the
anthem
was
being
sung
he
wore
a
tight
grey
coat
which
emphasised
his
slimness
and
his
shining
modish
silk
vest
cast
a
false
glitter
of
the
world
of
society
over
him
he
made
two
or
three
abrupt
bows
to
the
class
like
a
lieutenant
and
looked
very
shy
and
embarrassed
mälzer
said
the
principal
presenting
him
he
will
introduce
you
to
the
art
of
the
renaissance
i
should
like
you
young
ladies
to
listen
most
attentively
for
although
the
subject
is
not
obligatory
and
you
will
not
have
to
pass
an
examination
in
it
it
is
of
great
importance
for
general
education
and
i
shall
have
occasion
to
test
your
progress
in
the
literature
class
when
we
take
up
for
example
lessing
goethe
or
winckelmann
with
these
words
he
strutted
out
of
the
room
the
young
pedagogue
twirled
his
little
blond
moustache
which
fell
in
two
thin
scraggly
tufts
over
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
smile
both
bashful
and
sarcastic
flitted
across
his
face
he
looked
around
irresolutely
for
the
chair
hesitating
apparently
whether
to
sit
down
or
remain
standing
meta
jachmann
with
her
usual
inclination
to
be
silly
began
to
giggle
and
soon
half
the
class
had
followed
suit
a
hot
red
spread
over
the
teacher
wan
face
laugh
ladies
laugh
he
said
with
a
voice
which
despite
its
weakness
shook
his
narrow
chest
persons
in
your
position
may
well
laugh
for
a
life
full
of
activity
and
vigour
lies
ahead
of
you
i
may
rejoice
too
for
i
am
permitted
to
speak
to
you
as
soul
to
soul
which
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
rarely
falls
to
the
lot
of
a
novice
in
the
teaching
profession
you
will
find
that
out
from
your
own
experience
soon
enough
the
class
grew
still
as
a
mouse
from
that
moment
on
he
had
the
girls
in
his
grip
but
that
not
the
whole
of
my
good
fortune
he
continued
the
theme
which
the
authorities
of
this
institution
have
entrusted
to
my
slender
ability
whether
from
magnanimity
toward
me
or
lack
of
respect
for
the
subject
i
can
not
say
is
the
highest
theme
which
human
tradition
knows
every
personal
expression
in
history
however
defiant
revolutionary
or
alien
the
voice
of
the
chosen
one
that
uttered
it
later
exegesis
used
as
moral
fodder
with
which
to
satiate
the
masses
the
only
personages
with
whom
this
did
not
succeed
were
the
men
of
the
renaissance
the
nine
times
wise
branded
plato
as
a
shield
bearer
of
christianity
horace
as
a
pedant
augustine
as
a
church
saint
jesus
as
the
son
of
god
but
no
one
has
ever
undertaken
to
make
of
michael
angelo
of
alexander
borgia
of
machiavelli
anything
but
an
ego
an
ego
which
faces
surrounding
conditions
and
the
world
either
as
creator
or
destroyer
relying
on
the
fulness
of
his
own
power
the
young
souls
sat
up
and
listened
never
had
anyone
spoken
to
them
in
such
a
tone
they
felt
he
was
talking
his
life
away
but
in
the
very
moment
they
realised
this
they
drew
a
chain
of
freemasonry
about
him
with
which
they
shielded
him
he
continued
with
bold
rapid
strokes
which
wrung
new
life
from
the
dead
he
pictured
to
them
the
time
and
the
men
the
accumulation
of
many
years
of
repression
now
burst
from
him
in
passionate
utterance
his
auditors
suspected
that
here
was
more
than
a
school
lesson
more
even
than
the
harvest
of
scholarship
they
divined
that
they
were
listening
to
a
confession
of
faith
and
they
attached
themselves
to
him
with
all
the
rapturous
abandon
of
a
woman
and
pupil
most
rapturous
when
they
did
not
understand
lilly
being
one
of
the
younger
girls
sat
nearest
to
the
instructor
she
had
a
vague
feeling
as
of
a
flood
of
new
ineffably
beautiful
melodies
being
poured
over
her
since
everything
in
her
life
and
imagination
had
hitherto
centred
about
music
she
had
first
to
translate
pictures
and
thoughts
into
the
world
of
sound
before
her
perceptions
could
grasp
them
she
turned
pale
and
sat
there
squeezing
her
handkerchief
in
her
left
hand
her
eyes
staring
at
him
clouded
over
with
moisture
in
the
joy
of
surmise
she
saw
his
breast
working
saw
the
drops
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
saw
the
flames
burning
on
his
cheeks
she
wanted
to
weep
to
laugh
she
wanted
to
cry
stop
but
she
might
not
so
she
sat
motionless
and
listened
to
the
poor
suppressed
voice
proclaiming
the
evangel
of
that
old
time
which
is
still
new
she
listened
also
to
another
voice
which
cried
jubilantly
deep
down
in
her
heart
let
there
be
but
how
does
the
world
look
he
continued
in
which
that
life
developed
like
moses
i
have
viewed
it
only
from
the
mountain
i
have
loitered
a
little
in
its
outer
courts
but
i
have
seen
enough
for
me
to
know
that
my
soul
will
never
cease
to
desire
it
while
breath
remains
in
my
body
there
between
cypresses
and
evergreen
oaks
temples
and
palaces
sprang
up
in
white
glory
from
the
soil
seeming
like
a
part
of
it
what
is
clay
here
is
marble
there
what
is
routine
here
is
free
creative
energy
there
our
feeble
imitation
there
is
spontaneous
growth
here
laborious
grafted
culture
there
the
grace
of
a
happy
nature
here
pursuit
of
the
useful
there
voluptuous
passion
for
the
beautiful
here
sober
subtly
reasoning
protestantism
there
glad
naïve
catholic
paganism
this
came
to
lilly
like
a
blow
on
the
head
she
had
been
raised
by
catholic
parents
in
a
protestant
country
though
there
had
been
little
place
for
piety
in
her
home
a
great
deal
of
religious
enthusiasm
dwelt
in
her
soul
fostered
by
an
imaginative
faculty
and
a
compelling
emotionalism
to
hear
her
catholicism
praised
did
her
heart
good
but
why
it
should
be
linked
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
with
the
wicked
heathens
whom
she
had
been
taught
to
despise
and
deplore
was
a
riddle
to
her
her
mind
was
a
whirl
of
anxious
thoughts
and
queries
she
was
unable
to
follow
the
speaker
any
longer
and
lost
the
thread
of
his
discourse
until
after
a
while
she
heard
him
in
soft
caressing
words
give
a
picture
of
the
southern
country
she
saw
the
summer
sky
rising
over
the
isles
of
the
blessed
she
saw
the
sun
bloody
disk
dip
into
the
sea
blackened
by
the
breath
of
the
sirocco
saw
the
shepherd
with
his
flute
of
pan
pasturing
his
goats
on
the
shining
meadows
of
asphodel
saw
the
evergreen
forest
clambering
up
the
slopes
of
the
apennines
to
their
peaks
she
breathed
in
the
fragrance
of
the
laurels
and
strawberries
and
inhaled
the
olive
vapours
which
at
the
sounding
of
the
angelus
ascended
heavenward
in
blue
pillars
like
the
offerings
of
a
prayer
when
she
glanced
up
again
she
almost
started
back
in
fright
a
consuming
tortured
look
of
yearning
shot
from
his
eyes
as
they
stared
with
clairvoyant
gaze
past
them
all
into
emptiness
the
bell
rang
the
hour
was
over
he
looked
around
like
a
somnambulist
roused
from
sleep
snatched
up
his
hat
and
rushed
from
the
room
sacred
silence
remained
after
a
while
the
tension
was
broken
by
a
whisper
here
and
there
and
by
a
shy
fumbling
for
lilly
spoke
to
no
one
and
managed
to
make
her
escape
into
the
street
alone
humming
and
weeping
softly
she
walked
home
the
next
morning
there
was
profound
excitement
in
the
selecta
the
waves
set
in
motion
by
the
great
event
of
the
day
before
continued
to
vibrate
anna
marholz
the
daughter
of
a
physician
who
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
health
brought
some
facts
about
the
young
instructor
life
it
was
absolutely
necessary
she
reported
for
mälzer
to
go
to
the
south
if
he
remained
at
home
he
would
probably
not
survive
the
winter
lilly
heart
stood
still
the
others
considered
ways
and
means
of
helping
him
since
he
lacked
the
money
and
since
the
city
would
not
assume
the
cost
of
so
long
a
leave
of
absence
especially
as
his
position
was
not
yet
assured
the
means
for
saving
him
would
have
to
be
obtained
privately
let
form
a
committee
one
girl
proposed
and
the
others
seconded
enthusiastically
thank
god
lilly
thought
she
felt
as
if
his
life
had
already
been
prolonged
by
forty
or
fifty
years
at
the
ten
recess
they
lost
no
time
in
getting
together
for
urgent
deliberation
officers
were
chosen
and
lilly
had
the
inexpressible
joy
of
emerging
from
the
election
in
the
dignity
of
secretary
a
few
days
later
the
first
meeting
took
place
in
klein
confectionery
shop
they
did
not
venture
into
frangipani
the
resort
of
military
officers
and
city
officials
in
the
course
of
which
fifteen
young
ladies
consumed
fifteen
small
meringues
glacés
and
fifteen
cups
of
chocolate
business
expenses
subsequently
to
be
divided
among
them
various
promising
plans
were
submitted
for
consideration
emily
faber
suggested
that
a
public
reading
of
romeo
and
juliet
with
assigned
rôles
be
given
in
the
club
house
and
the
leading
man
of
the
city
theatre
be
asked
to
take
the
part
of
romeo
the
proposal
received
unanimous
approval
for
this
leading
man
was
one
of
the
most
beloved
of
leading
men
that
ever
found
his
way
into
girls
hearts
kate
vitzing
whose
cousin
was
tenor
of
the
boys
high
school
quartette
proposed
an
amateur
concert
to
be
given
jointly
by
the
quartette
and
the
selecta
this
too
was
unanimously
approved
finally
rosalie
katz
who
was
of
a
practical
turn
submitted
a
scheme
for
printing
subscription
blanks
to
be
presented
to
citizens
this
plan
gave
less
satisfaction
but
in
the
end
the
girls
agreed
that
one
good
thing
need
not
exclude
another
and
decided
to
put
all
three
projects
into
execution
lilly
conscientiously
recorded
all
the
transactions
and
her
heart
went
for
him
the
lectures
on
the
history
of
art
followed
their
regular
course
so
also
the
meetings
of
the
aid
committee
the
consumption
of
meringues
glacés
and
cups
of
chocolate
remained
on
about
the
same
level
but
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
markedly
diminished
not
that
subsequent
lectures
offered
ground
for
disillusionment
rich
alike
in
substance
and
figures
of
speech
they
never
failed
to
win
the
same
tense
sympathy
from
the
girls
but
the
plans
for
helping
him
had
met
with
serious
obstacles
the
romeo
had
been
engaged
to
perform
in
another
city
at
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
the
quartette
had
been
refused
permission
to
coöperate
with
the
selecta
and
a
permit
from
the
police
department
was
necessary
for
a
house
to
house
collection
none
of
the
girls
dared
apply
for
it
thus
the
great
idea
gradually
petered
out
terminating
in
a
confectioner
bill
of
which
three
marks
eighty
fell
to
share
lilly
well
knew
the
way
to
the
pawnbroker
and
she
did
not
have
to
pluck
up
courage
before
relinquishing
the
little
gold
cross
that
she
wore
about
her
neck
the
last
remnant
of
better
days
besides
it
was
all
for
his
sake
autumn
came
and
mälzer
grew
worse
he
coughed
a
great
deal
each
time
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
and
then
examining
it
furtively
one
day
the
girls
were
told
that
the
lectures
on
the
history
of
art
would
be
discontinued
until
further
notice
anna
marholz
reported
he
had
had
a
hemorrhage
lilly
did
not
stop
to
ask
for
an
explanation
of
what
that
meant
he
dying
he
dying
was
the
cry
in
her
soul
after
dark
she
stole
to
his
house
anna
marholz
had
found
his
address
in
one
of
her
father
books
a
weary
lamp
was
burning
in
his
room
not
a
shadow
stirred
no
hand
appeared
at
the
but
the
little
lamp
continued
to
burn
patiently
for
hours
and
hours
despite
its
weariness
all
the
time
that
lilly
trotted
up
and
down
the
damp
street
in
front
of
his
house
full
of
conscientious
scruples
for
having
robbed
her
toiling
mother
of
her
help
the
adventure
was
repeated
the
following
evenings
and
anxiety
waxed
in
lilly
soul
she
pictured
him
lying
there
gasping
for
breath
with
no
woman
hand
to
wipe
the
death
sweat
from
his
brow
on
saturday
her
solicitude
drove
her
from
her
early
in
the
afternoon
to
patrol
his
house
in
broad
daylight
was
impossible
but
she
ventured
to
pass
it
once
and
lacked
the
courage
to
return
then
she
was
seized
by
a
heroic
resolve
she
went
to
the
florist
shop
and
sacrificing
the
two
marks
eighty
left
over
from
the
transaction
of
the
little
cross
she
walked
back
to
his
house
with
a
brownish
yellow
bouquet
of
drooping
autumn
roses
without
stopping
to
think
she
ran
up
the
steps
and
rang
at
the
door
of
the
second
story
where
she
had
seen
the
green
lamp
an
old
woman
in
a
soiled
blue
apron
and
mumbling
her
lips
opened
the
door
lilly
stammered
mälzer
name
in
the
rear
said
the
woman
and
shut
the
door
then
the
little
green
lamp
did
not
burn
for
him
an
old
woman
lived
there
who
wore
a
dirty
apron
and
whose
lips
kept
mumbling
for
a
week
she
had
been
worshipping
a
false
idol
disappointed
she
was
about
to
steal
down
the
stairs
when
her
eye
caught
his
name
among
four
her
heart
leapt
and
before
she
knew
it
she
had
knocked
a
brief
interval
elapsed
before
his
head
appeared
behind
the
door
which
he
held
only
partly
open
the
lapels
of
his
grey
coat
were
raised
to
cover
his
neck
which
apparently
was
collarless
his
hair
was
in
wild
disorder
and
the
ends
of
his
moustache
were
more
matted
than
ever
and
how
his
eyes
glared
as
they
seemed
to
demand
in
embarrassment
what
do
you
want
miss
miss
miss
he
stammered
he
appeared
to
recognise
her
but
failed
to
recall
her
name
lilly
wanted
to
give
him
the
bouquet
and
run
away
but
she
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
as
if
paralysed
you
have
been
sent
here
by
your
class
i
presume
he
said
yes
yes
lilly
answered
eagerly
that
was
her
salvation
otherwise
you
see
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
invite
you
to
come
in
he
continued
with
a
shy
smile
it
might
have
very
serious
consequences
for
both
of
us
but
as
a
delegate
he
reflected
a
moment
come
in
please
lilly
had
imagined
him
living
in
high
spacious
apartments
surrounded
by
carved
bookcases
vases
globes
and
busts
of
great
men
in
dismay
she
observed
a
little
room
with
only
one
window
an
unmade
bed
an
open
card
table
a
and
a
small
holding
mostly
unbound
and
crumpled
old
volumes
such
were
his
quarters
he
lives
more
wretchedly
than
we
do
she
thought
at
his
invitation
she
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
two
chairs
feeling
less
embarrassed
than
she
had
expected
to
poverty
shared
alike
brought
them
nearer
to
each
other
how
lovely
in
the
young
ladies
to
remember
me
lilly
recollected
the
flowers
she
still
held
in
her
hand
oh
excuse
me
she
said
proffering
them
he
took
the
bouquet
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
pressed
them
against
his
face
they
do
smell
he
said
they
are
the
last
but
my
first
so
you
can
imagine
how
precious
they
are
to
me
lilly
felt
her
eyes
growing
dim
with
joy
are
you
still
in
pain
dr
mälzer
she
managed
to
ask
he
laughed
pain
no
i
do
suffer
from
pain
a
little
fever
now
and
then
but
the
fever
pleasant
very
amusing
your
soul
seems
to
soar
in
a
balloon
away
over
everything
over
cities
countries
seas
over
centuries
too
and
often
great
persons
come
to
visit
you
persons
if
not
so
beautiful
that
is
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
his
compliment
frightened
him
why
he
was
the
teacher
and
she
the
pupil
in
the
midst
of
his
embarrassment
a
certain
blindness
seemed
suddenly
to
drop
away
from
him
he
stared
at
her
with
eyes
burning
like
torches
in
two
blue
hollows
what
is
your
name
he
asked
in
a
voice
even
shriller
and
hoarser
than
usual
lilly
lilly
czepanek
the
name
was
not
familiar
to
him
as
he
had
been
in
the
city
only
a
short
time
you
intend
to
become
a
teacher
yes
dr
mälzer
do
you
know
what
get
yourself
exiled
to
russia
and
throw
bombs
go
to
a
and
wash
sores
marry
a
drunkard
who
will
beat
you
and
sell
your
bed
from
under
your
body
become
a
teacher
not
why
not
just
i
i
will
tell
you
why
a
person
with
watery
eyes
and
falling
hair
who
can
only
see
one
side
of
a
subject
such
a
creature
should
be
a
teacher
somebody
without
the
blood
and
nerve
to
live
his
own
life
can
teach
others
to
live
he
good
enough
for
that
but
he
whose
blood
flows
through
his
body
like
fluid
fire
whose
yearning
spurts
from
his
eyes
to
whom
the
problems
of
life
exist
for
seeing
and
knowing
not
for
paltry
criticism
he
who
but
i
must
talk
to
you
about
that
though
i
should
very
much
like
to
please
do
please
lilly
implored
how
old
are
you
sixteen
and
already
a
woman
his
eyes
scanned
her
in
pained
admiration
look
at
me
he
continued
i
too
was
once
a
human
being
you
believe
it
i
too
once
stretched
two
sturdy
arms
longingly
to
heaven
i
too
once
looked
with
desire
into
a
girl
eyes
though
not
into
such
as
yours
let
me
prattle
a
dying
man
can
do
no
harm
but
you
shall
not
die
she
cried
jumping
from
her
seat
he
laughed
sit
down
child
and
do
excite
yourself
about
me
it
does
pay
a
friend
of
mine
once
broke
the
of
a
cat
that
had
gone
mad
he
did
it
with
one
blow
of
a
stick
the
cat
could
run
away
she
could
howl
she
could
do
anything
but
just
remain
on
all
fours
and
cough
and
choke
and
cough
and
choke
until
the
second
blow
came
the
way
it
is
with
me
there
nothing
to
be
done
go
away
child
already
made
my
peace
but
when
i
look
at
you
my
heart
grows
heavy
again
lilly
turned
her
face
away
to
hide
her
tears
must
i
she
asked
must
he
laughed
again
i
shall
feed
on
every
minute
of
your
presence
as
a
hungry
man
feeds
on
the
crumbs
he
digs
out
of
his
pockets
you
sat
on
the
left
end
of
the
first
bench
i
remember
i
said
to
myself
a
pair
of
improbable
eyes
such
eyes
the
magic
dogs
of
andersen
tales
must
have
eyes
to
which
you
would
like
to
say
please
do
make
such
big
eyes
and
from
being
thought
big
they
grow
still
bigger
and
bigger
now
lilly
laughed
you
see
he
said
i
have
made
you
merry
again
you
must
not
carry
away
too
deathlike
a
picture
from
here
our
lessons
were
beautiful
were
they
lilly
answered
with
a
sigh
when
i
spoke
of
italy
you
gasped
a
couple
of
times
from
sheer
longing
i
thought
to
myself
gasping
just
like
yourself
yet
she
need
it
would
you
like
to
go
there
very
very
much
lilly
ventured
to
ask
ask
a
man
on
fire
whether
he
would
like
to
take
a
cold
plunge
and
it
the
only
thing
that
would
save
your
life
he
looked
her
up
and
down
a
moment
with
a
black
morose
gaze
why
are
you
questioning
me
what
do
you
want
to
find
out
tell
the
young
ladies
of
your
class
that
i
very
grateful
to
them
tell
them
touched
by
their
sympathy
i
an
attack
of
coughing
choked
him
lilly
jumped
up
and
looked
about
for
help
she
instinctively
seized
a
glass
from
the
which
was
half
filled
with
a
pale
liquid
and
held
it
to
his
mouth
he
groped
for
it
eagerly
after
drinking
he
fell
back
exhausted
and
looked
at
her
gratefully
tenderly
she
returned
his
look
with
a
feeble
smile
thinking
only
one
thought
what
happiness
to
be
here
it
was
so
quiet
in
the
dark
overheated
room
that
she
could
hear
the
ticking
of
his
watch
which
hung
on
the
wall
not
far
away
he
wanted
to
sit
up
and
speak
but
he
seemed
not
to
have
recovered
sufficient
strength
lilly
gave
him
an
imploring
look
of
warning
he
smiled
and
leaned
back
again
so
they
sat
in
silence
what
happiness
thought
lilly
what
great
great
happiness
then
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
wearily
she
took
them
in
an
eager
grasp
of
both
her
own
they
felt
hot
and
clammy
and
his
pulse
beat
down
to
his
it
went
twice
as
fast
as
hers
for
she
could
feel
hers
too
listen
child
sweet
he
whispered
i
want
to
give
you
a
piece
of
good
advice
to
carry
away
with
you
you
have
too
much
love
in
you
all
three
kinds
love
of
the
heart
love
of
the
senses
love
springing
from
pity
one
of
them
everybody
must
have
if
he
not
to
be
a
fossil
two
are
dangerous
all
three
lead
to
ruin
be
on
guard
against
your
own
love
do
squander
it
that
my
advice
the
advice
of
one
on
whom
you
can
not
squander
it
for
i
can
use
it
god
knows
how
well
i
can
use
it
have
you
nobody
to
stay
with
you
she
asked
dreading
to
hear
that
some
other
woman
had
the
right
to
nurse
him
he
shook
his
head
may
i
come
again
he
started
struck
by
the
ardour
with
which
she
asked
the
question
if
the
class
sends
you
again
of
course
lilly
cast
aside
all
reserve
that
was
a
lie
she
stammered
not
a
soul
knows
i
came
here
he
sprang
to
his
feet
almost
like
a
man
in
good
health
his
face
lengthened
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
he
stretched
out
his
hands
which
were
trembling
violently
as
if
to
ward
her
off
go
he
whispered
go
lilly
did
not
stir
if
you
do
go
he
went
on
excitement
almost
stifling
his
words
you
will
ruin
your
future
young
ladies
do
not
visit
unmarried
men
who
live
the
way
i
do
even
if
the
man
is
their
teacher
and
sick
as
i
am
tell
no
one
that
you
have
been
here
no
friend
not
a
single
human
being
your
livelihood
depends
upon
your
reputation
i
can
not
steal
your
bread
may
i
never
come
again
her
eyes
pled
with
him
no
he
shouted
in
a
voice
like
riven
iron
lilly
felt
herself
being
shoved
through
the
doorway
the
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
behind
her
she
disobeyed
his
injunction
that
very
hour
she
ran
to
rosalie
katz
her
friend
to
confess
everything
and
relieve
her
feelings
in
tears
the
little
brown
jewess
had
a
soft
heart
and
was
also
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
teacher
and
so
the
girls
wept
together
but
they
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
and
thus
it
happened
that
katz
whose
wealth
and
social
position
found
pictorial
expression
in
a
round
paunch
and
whose
waistcoat
buttons
consequently
were
always
coming
loose
entered
his
daughter
room
to
have
one
sewed
on
when
he
discovered
the
girls
in
tearful
embrace
he
discreetly
retired
but
the
instant
lilly
had
left
the
house
he
extracted
all
the
completer
a
confession
from
his
daughter
he
learned
the
story
of
the
sick
teacher
the
abortive
committee
meetings
and
the
futile
meringues
glacés
well
we
can
fix
that
he
said
with
a
smirk
twirling
the
very
thin
watch
chain
heavy
watch
chains
were
worn
only
by
those
among
the
grain
merchants
who
had
remained
below
on
the
social
scale
which
branched
out
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
from
the
third
buttonhole
of
his
waistcoat
a
week
later
mälzer
received
a
registered
letter
from
two
strangers
informing
him
that
means
had
been
found
to
enable
him
to
make
a
lengthy
sojourn
in
the
south
all
he
needed
to
do
was
obtain
leave
of
absence
and
draw
the
first
payment
at
the
office
of
goldbaum
katz
co
he
departed
on
a
cold
crisp
october
evening
the
faculty
accompanied
him
to
the
station
lilly
and
rosalie
who
had
learned
the
time
of
his
leaving
at
papa
katz
office
also
were
present
but
they
kept
themselves
in
the
background
he
glided
past
them
muffled
in
a
thick
scarf
his
fiery
eyes
turned
upon
the
distance
when
the
train
left
the
two
girls
flung
themselves
into
each
arms
and
wept
for
love
and
pride
on
their
way
home
rosalie
invited
her
friend
to
have
an
éclair
with
her
for
it
had
grown
too
cold
for
meringues
glacés
half
an
hour
later
they
were
sitting
in
the
confectionery
shop
smiling
at
each
other
and
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
illustrated
papers
chapter
iv
with
the
advent
of
spring
a
new
and
gayer
existence
began
for
czepanek
he
was
soon
coming
that
was
certain
but
even
if
the
time
was
short
why
spend
it
over
that
disgusting
sewing
there
was
a
less
wearing
way
of
making
a
living
the
thing
was
simple
enough
rent
an
apartment
of
nine
rooms
buy
the
furniture
on
credit
and
have
a
plate
hung
on
the
outside
of
the
house
inscribed
board
and
lodging
for
students
as
for
the
rest
well
a
way
would
be
found
this
little
set
of
thoughts
took
exclusive
possession
of
poor
brain
riddled
like
a
sieve
by
the
incessant
whirr
of
the
though
such
a
careless
existence
appealed
to
lilly
fancy
she
harboured
some
small
doubts
in
the
first
place
the
clamouring
threatening
duns
that
had
besieged
their
home
after
papa
departure
were
still
fresh
in
her
shuddering
memory
then
she
did
not
see
quite
clearly
where
so
many
students
enough
to
fill
a
apartment
were
suddenly
to
come
from
after
the
beginning
of
the
summer
semester
since
all
had
secured
quarters
already
but
her
mother
would
listen
to
no
objections
i
will
go
to
the
directors
i
will
go
to
the
mayor
i
will
and
the
attic
room
resounded
with
the
new
triumphant
i
will
now
began
a
series
of
mysterious
expeditions
frequently
when
lilly
returned
from
school
she
could
tell
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
that
the
machine
whose
industrious
clatter
had
greeted
her
for
years
was
at
a
standstill
and
she
would
find
the
key
to
the
room
under
the
as
the
time
drew
near
for
the
great
event
the
mother
became
more
taciturn
a
crafty
smile
lay
on
her
face
which
but
for
an
admixture
of
scorn
was
like
the
smile
parents
wear
before
christmas
she
painted
her
cheeks
more
carefully
than
ever
and
the
jar
of
rouge
which
previously
she
had
kept
locked
away
from
lilly
reposed
unabashed
on
the
top
of
the
chest
but
money
grew
rapidly
scarcer
lilly
had
to
give
up
every
minute
she
could
spare
from
school
work
to
make
up
for
her
mother
remissness
while
czepanek
went
about
calculating
and
speculating
she
put
her
foot
to
the
treadle
only
on
rare
occasions
when
lilly
pled
with
her
urgently
the
delivery
of
finished
articles
became
more
and
more
irregular
and
the
two
women
were
in
danger
of
losing
their
entire
means
of
subsistence
lilly
vast
hoard
of
youthful
strength
threatened
to
give
out
yet
this
did
not
cause
her
overmuch
concern
something
turn
up
she
thought
if
only
she
could
have
gotten
one
good
night
rest
instead
of
lying
dressed
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
from
two
to
six
in
the
morning
she
would
not
have
grudged
her
mother
her
youthful
intoxication
born
of
young
hopes
lilly
sat
in
school
with
tired
reddened
eyes
a
filmy
veil
between
her
and
the
world
between
her
and
the
thoughts
she
was
expected
to
think
her
teachers
began
to
find
fault
with
her
it
was
high
time
for
the
new
life
to
begin
it
began
on
a
hot
drab
july
day
on
returning
from
school
lilly
saw
two
waggons
standing
outside
the
door
loaded
with
furniture
smelling
of
fresh
varnish
even
before
she
set
foot
on
the
lowest
step
she
could
hear
her
mother
shrill
voice
apparently
raised
in
altercation
with
strangers
lilly
ran
upstairs
her
heart
beating
fast
two
drivers
wearing
black
leather
aprons
were
standing
there
one
with
a
bill
in
his
hand
demanding
money
a
look
of
amusement
was
on
their
red
faces
czepanek
was
tripping
to
and
fro
running
her
fingers
through
her
hair
and
screaming
all
sorts
of
things
about
rascality
and
broken
promises
and
grinding
down
the
poor
whereupon
the
men
laughed
and
said
they
like
to
get
back
home
that
day
this
set
czepanek
off
completely
she
tried
to
snatch
the
bill
from
the
man
hand
he
refused
to
give
it
up
and
she
set
to
pummelling
him
with
her
fists
lilly
sprang
between
them
caught
hold
of
her
mother
who
fought
desperately
and
called
to
the
men
to
leave
telling
them
everything
would
be
arranged
so
the
men
took
themselves
off
her
mother
wrath
now
descended
upon
lilly
if
you
had
come
she
screamed
i
would
have
gotten
hold
of
the
receipt
and
everything
would
have
been
all
right
now
i
have
to
go
there
again
while
if
you
had
mixed
in
the
furniture
could
have
been
unpacked
in
the
new
apartment
this
very
day
what
new
apartment
czepanek
laughed
how
could
lilly
be
so
stupid
did
she
think
her
mother
had
been
going
about
idle
all
that
time
then
everything
was
revealed
the
apartment
had
already
been
rented
and
all
they
needed
to
do
was
move
in
even
the
plate
had
already
been
made
when
hung
it
would
act
like
magic
so
much
for
the
outside
but
had
she
strained
every
nerve
on
the
inside
equipment
too
she
was
going
to
describe
the
furniture
for
it
might
make
her
angry
again
but
she
had
bought
curtains
for
twelve
windows
the
pattern
a
chinese
lady
and
a
palm
leaf
and
six
rugs
good
ones
because
students
usually
have
a
pretty
heavy
tramp
and
cheap
stuff
would
wear
out
like
chiffon
big
english
wash
basins
with
gold
flowers
the
pattern
exactly
matching
the
pattern
of
the
ten
stands
unfortunately
the
dishes
were
not
ready
for
delivery
because
it
always
took
three
or
four
weeks
to
have
the
monogram
burnt
in
but
they
would
have
to
have
something
to
eat
from
so
for
the
meantime
she
had
bought
a
cheaper
set
for
eighteen
people
everything
thoroughly
refined
and
respectable
she
had
been
very
clever
and
very
careful
in
the
entire
matter
while
engaged
in
this
description
czepanek
walked
about
the
with
long
shambling
steps
her
small
eyes
with
the
traces
of
many
sleepless
hours
upon
them
glistened
and
gleamed
and
beneath
the
false
glowed
the
genuine
red
on
her
haggard
cheeks
lilly
who
was
beginning
to
be
a
bit
uneasy
ventured
to
inquire
concerning
the
payments
her
mother
simply
laughed
at
her
you
are
either
a
lady
and
impress
the
tradespeople
or
you
are
not
a
lady
i
think
that
i
the
wife
of
kilian
czepanek
conductor
of
the
singing
society
am
thoroughly
entitled
to
be
treated
with
respect
are
the
things
at
the
apartment
czepanek
laughed
again
what
should
i
do
with
them
before
the
apartment
is
in
order
apartments
have
to
be
freshly
painted
and
papered
then
with
the
graceful
gesture
which
only
the
ability
to
pay
bestows
upon
a
person
she
added
i
was
especially
careful
in
selecting
the
to
get
artistic
patterns
lilly
had
a
sickish
feeling
it
was
like
being
in
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
your
schoolmates
were
teasing
you
added
to
all
the
other
annoyances
nothing
had
been
gotten
for
dinner
lilly
set
the
coffee
on
to
boil
and
put
the
afternoon
rolls
on
the
table
well
then
they
would
simply
skip
a
meal
again
the
two
czepaneks
had
grown
nimble
in
that
sort
of
skipping
the
mother
hastily
gulped
down
the
hot
drink
no
time
must
be
lost
she
said
they
would
have
to
get
at
the
packing
at
this
point
she
was
seized
by
another
attack
of
fury
had
you
held
my
hands
you
you
she
screamed
we
should
have
had
that
lovely
furniture
in
its
place
by
morning
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
move
in
with
all
this
trash
what
the
people
say
when
they
see
it
she
tore
at
her
artificial
curls
and
despairingly
brandished
the
with
which
she
was
slicing
her
roll
then
she
turned
up
the
sleeves
of
her
blouse
and
said
the
packing
should
begin
she
emptied
the
wardrobe
and
piled
the
clothes
over
the
bottom
of
the
bed
the
underwear
and
linen
the
contents
of
their
linen
chest
she
sent
flying
over
the
floor
the
sinews
of
her
withered
arms
jerked
the
sweat
trickled
down
her
forehead
lilly
watching
the
aimless
pother
with
an
oppressed
feeling
at
her
heart
noticed
the
score
of
the
song
of
songs
the
home
greatest
treasure
lying
on
the
floor
heedlessly
thrown
there
by
her
mother
along
with
nightgowns
and
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
what
are
you
after
with
the
song
of
songs
screamed
the
mother
she
had
been
kneeling
and
now
jumped
to
her
feet
nothing
said
lilly
in
surprise
i
was
just
going
to
put
it
on
the
table
you
lie
the
mother
screeched
you
thing
you
want
to
steal
it
the
way
you
stole
the
receipt
i
spoil
your
little
game
for
you
lilly
suddenly
saw
a
gleaming
something
pass
before
her
eyes
and
felt
a
pain
at
her
throat
felt
something
warm
spread
soothingly
down
to
her
left
breast
not
until
her
mother
prepared
for
a
second
thrust
did
lilly
realise
it
was
the
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
she
uttered
a
piercing
scream
and
grasped
her
mother
wrist
but
the
mother
had
developed
giant
strength
and
lilly
would
probably
have
succumbed
in
the
struggle
that
ensued
had
not
the
noise
they
made
drawn
the
neighbours
to
the
spot
czepanek
was
caught
from
behind
and
bound
with
handkerchiefs
she
held
the
in
a
tight
clutch
which
the
strongest
man
could
not
relax
and
did
not
drop
it
until
an
opiate
had
been
administered
by
the
physician
who
had
hurried
to
the
scene
lilly
wound
was
dressed
and
she
was
taken
to
the
hospital
where
she
remained
temporarily
because
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
her
while
at
the
hospital
she
learned
that
her
mother
had
been
placed
in
the
district
insane
asylum
and
in
all
likelihood
would
never
come
out
of
it
again
lilly
was
left
alone
in
the
world
chapter
v
well
young
lady
said
pieper
the
prominent
lawyer
i
have
been
appointed
your
guardian
i
accepted
the
office
because
i
thought
it
my
duty
the
papers
in
lemke
militzky
he
interrupted
himself
to
call
to
his
managing
clerk
who
had
just
then
entered
what
was
i
going
to
say
oh
yes
because
i
thought
it
my
duty
despite
my
being
an
extremely
busy
man
to
assist
widows
and
orphans
to
the
best
of
my
feeble
ability
he
passed
his
exquisitely
cherished
left
hand
over
his
shining
bald
pate
and
beard
beneath
which
a
worldly
mouth
half
concealed
an
epicurean
smile
my
wards
all
make
their
way
in
the
world
he
continued
it
my
pride
to
have
them
succeed
the
way
they
do
it
well
that
my
affair
a
business
secret
so
to
say
i
am
convinced
my
child
that
you
too
will
get
along
if
i
did
think
so
i
should
not
be
so
interested
in
you
probably
the
first
thing
is
to
get
the
young
ladies
the
right
positions
the
homely
ones
give
most
trouble
unless
they
happen
to

you
probably

tell
you
merely
that
you
may
learn
with
time

i
must
explain
the
main
art
in

is
to
determine
the
boundary
line
between
demands
justifiable
and
demands
unjustifiable
that
is
you
must
have
a
feeling
for
exactly
how
far
your
powers
will
reach
in
each
circumstance
as
it
arises
a
girl
like
you
the
managing
clerk
a
tall
bony
fellow
suddenly
appeared
at
the

shoving
a

of

guardian
resumed
the
time
i
have
to
spare
for
you
is
nearly
gone
you
can
not
continue
with
your
schooling
that
plain
there
no
money
for
it
but
even
if
you
had
the
means
i
not
certain
whether
in
view
of
your
future
however
a
governess
may
make
a
brilliant
match
it
sometimes
occurs
chiefly
to
be
sure
in
english
novels
but
there
the
danger
too
that
you
might
excuse
me
for
the
word
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
ca
think
of
another
besides
the
right
one
that
you
might
be
seduced
what
i
rather
see
you
than
anything
else
is
the
lady
in
a
large
photographic
establishment
who
receives
customers
but
it
seems
to
me
you
have
enough
as
yet
for
that
one
must
make
a
deep
impression
at
first
sight
because
people
who
leave
an
order
have
to
have
some
inducement
for
coming
back
to
call
for
their
pictures
i
selected
something
else
for
you
for
the
purpose
more
of
giving
you
a
short
period
of
trial
than
of
providing
you
with
a
permanent
position
it
in
a
circulating
library
it
will
give
you
plenty
of
opportunity
discreetly
you
know
not
to
hide
your
light
under
a
bushel
the
remuneration
i
need
scarcely
say
will
be
moderate
free
board
and
lodging
and
twenty
marks
a
month
you
will
have
a
chance
to
let
your
fancy
i
suppose
you
not
yet
let
your
fancy
roam
at
will
in
the
fields
of
general
literature
there
you
are
young
lady
mercy
on
us
why
are
you
crying
lilly
quickly
dried
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
cheeks
i
just
come
from
the
hospital
was
the
only
excuse
she
could
find
i
still
a
little
i
beg
your
pardon
the
prominent
lawyer
shook
his
head
his
bald
spot
looked
as
petted
and
pampered
as
a
lovely
woman
cheeks
you
must
get
out
of
the
habit
of
crying
too
if
you
want
to
make
your
way
in
the
world
tears
are
not
in
place
until
you
are
oh
yes
something
else
the
things
your
poor
mother
owned
must
be
sold
the
proceeds
will
serve
as
a
small
capital
i
lay
stress
on
having
such
a
sum
no
matter
how
insignificant
now
you
will
go
back
to
your
home
with
my
man
the
key
was
deposited
at
my
office
and
select
what
you
think
you
absolutely
need
or
he
smiled
a
little
what
filial
devotion
leads
you
to
prize
my
dear
in
six
months
come
to
me
again
lilly
felt
a
cool
soft
hand
which
seemed
incapable
of
bestowing
a
pressure
lie
in
her
own
for
an
instant
then
she
found
herself
staggering
down
the
dark
steps
behind
a
clerk
who
had
been
waiting
for
her
outside
the
door
with
the
key
to
her
home
she
wanted
to
speak
to
him
ask
him
questions
beg
him
for
something
but
for
what
she
herself
knew
not
when
the
clerk
opened
up
the
musty
room
where
the
twilight
was
broken
by
shafts
of
light
as
in
a
tomb
the
tomb
of
her
life
the
tomb
of
her
youth
lilly
felt
that
now
everything
was
over
and
all
left
her
was
to
fall
asleep
here
and
die
the
clerk
threw
the
shutters
back
and
raised
the
windows
the
clothes
were
still
lying
on
the
bed
the
underwear
and
on
the
floor
and
close
by
were
two
brown
stains
the
blood
that
had
flowed
from
her
wound
the
knife
too
was
still
there
lilly
restrained
her
desire
to
cry
shamed
by
the
presence
of
the
clerk
who
stood
there
stupidly
whistling
with
his
lower
lip
thrust
out
lilly
threw
her
clothes
into
the
which
her
mother
had
intended
to
use
in
moving
to
the
apartment
added
a
few
pieces
of
underwear
and
some
books
chosen
at
random
and
then
looked
around
for
mementos
her
brain
was
befogged
she
saw
everything
and
recognised
nothing
but
there
on
the
table
there
bound
with
rubber
bands
soaked
in
her
blood
untouched
because
no
one
knew
its
value
lay
the
song
of
songs
lilly
snatched
it
up
shut
down
the
trunk
lid
and
with
the
score
under
her
arm
stepped
out
into
the
new
life
hungry
for
experience
chapter
vi
asmussen
two
daughters
had
run
away
from
home
again
the
whole
neighbourhood
knew
it
lilly
had
scarcely
set
foot
in
the
dusky
room
smelling
of
dust
and
leather
where
soiled
volumes
on
pine
shelves
reached
to
the
ceiling
when
she
too
became
acquainted
with
the
fact
asmussen
was
a
dignified
dame
whom
nature
had
endowed
with
gracious
rotundity
she
received
lilly
at
the
entrance
to
her
circulating
library
and
amid
kisses
and
tears
declared
that
even
before
seeing
lilly
she
had
conceived
a
love
for
her
such
as
she
would
cherish
for
a
child
of
her
own
and
now
that
she
had
met
her
face
to
face
she
was
completely
bewitched
and
people
speak
of
the
cold
world
thought
lilly
whom
this
sort
of
reception
pleased
very
well
what
did
i
say
a
child
of
my
nonsense
i
love
you
more
much
more
ever
and
ever
and
ever
so
much
more
daughters
are
venomous
serpents
on
whom
love
is
wasted
they
are
parasites
to
be
torn
from
one
breast
torn
she
stopped
because
the
stupid
clerk
who
had
accompanied
lilly
in
a
cab
was
shoving
her
trunk
over
the
threshold
after
he
left
asmussen
continued
do
you
think
i
loved
my
daughters
or
did
love
them
did
i
or
did
i
not
say
to
them
every
day
father
a
blackguard
a
cur
and
may
the
devil
take
him
how
do
you
think
they
rewarded
me
one
morning
i
get
up
and
find
they
gone
mind
you
absolutely
gone
beds
empty
and
a
note
on
the
table
going
to
father
you
beat
us
too
much
and
we
sick
and
tired
of
that
eternal
mush
look
at
me
my
dear
am
i
not
goodness
itself
do
i
look
as
if
i
could
beat
much
less
my
own
daughters
and
do
you
suppose
this
is
the
first
time
they
did
it
the
first
time
they
overwhelmed
me
with
shame
and
disgrace
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
what
would
you
say
if
i
were
to
tell
you
it
the
time
twice
before
i
pardoned
them
and
took
them
to
my
bosom
i
found
them
lying
outside
my
door
in
tears
and
rags
yes
yes
that
the
way
it
was
that
the
way
it
is
the
way
it
is
but
if
they
dare
to
return
here
a
broom
here
look
behind
the
door
i
put
it
there
the
instant
i
found
out
they
had
gone
and
there
it
will
remain
until
i
take
hold
of
it
and
beat
them
out
beat
them
out
through
the
door
to
the
street
this
way
this
way
this
way
with
a
gesture
of
ineffable
disgust
asmussen
swept
an
invisible
something
through
the
hall
and
let
it
lie
outside
giving
it
a
look
of
unspeakable
contempt
the
poor
poor
woman
thought
lilly
how
she
must
have
suffered
and
she
registered
a
silent
vow
to
do
her
utmost
to
replace
the
faithless
children
in
the
abandoned
mother
heart
at
this
point
a
young
man
entered
a
customer
who
wanted
to
exchange
a
book
he
asked
for
one
of
zola
works
and
looked
at
lilly
triumphantly
as
if
to
say
you
see
that
the
kind
i
am
asmussen
went
to
fetch
the
book
shaking
her
head
softly
in
deprecation
the
customer
took
it
hastily
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
the
look
of
warning
with
which
she
handed
it
to
him
look
my
dear
she
said
after
he
left
that
the
way
youth
goes
to
its
ruin
and
i
myself
am
condemned
to
point
the
way
how
queried
lilly
who
had
been
listening
with
the
keenest
interest
do
you
know
what
inside
an
apothecary
shop
lilly
said
she
had
often
been
in
an
apothecary
shop
but
could
not
itemise
the
contents
her
mistress
continued
one
closet
is
marked
it
contains
the
most
awful
poisons
mankind
knows
that
why
it
always
locked
and
only
the
owner
and
his
assistant
may
have
the
key
to
it
now
look
about
you
half
of
what
you
see
here
is
poison
too
everything
written
these
days
vitiates
the
soul
and
lures
it
to
its
destruction
yet
i
must
keep
the
wicked
books
and
though
my
heart
bleeds
i
must
hand
them
over
to
any
and
everybody
who
asks
for
them
oh
i
need
but
to
think
of
my
undutiful
daughters
no
use
my
telling
them
not
to
they
read
at
any
rate
they
read
and
read
the
whole
night
long
and
when
they
were
crammed
full
of
impudence
and
corruption
they
did
like
the
food
i
prepared
for
them
and
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
to
go
out
walking
on
top
of
it
all
they
went
sneaking
off
to
their
father
that
miserable
cur
that
common
cheat
that
scum
of
the
earth
child
i
warn
you
against
that
man
should
you
ever
meet
him
lift
your
skirts
and
spit
the
way
spitting
now
lilly
shuddered
at
the
man
frightful
vileness
but
took
some
courage
in
the
thought
that
she
had
found
her
natural
protector
in
this
excellent
woman
an
hour
later
they
went
to
supper
which
consisted
of
mush
and
sandwiches
with
nothing
but
clarified
fat
between
lilly
whose
palate
had
not
been
pampered
was
easily
persuaded
that
nobody
in
the
world
knew
how
to
prepare
such
dainty
mush
and
that
the
emperor
himself
was
seldom
served
with
more
delicious
sandwiches
had
a
little
ham
been
added
to
the
repast
such
as
she
had
gotten
for
supper
every
evening
at
the
hospital
the
acme
of
earthly
enjoyments
in
her
opinion
would
have
been
attained
going
to
bed
provided
her
with
another
pleasure
the
books
of
the
circulating
library
were
kept
in
a
large
room
with
three
windows
divided
into
four
compartments
by
two
bookcases
running
from
the
windowed
wall
deep
into
the
room
and
by
a
counter
opposite
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
a
passageway
along
the
wall
dividing
the
library
from
the
inner
room
was
the
only
means
of
getting
from
one
compartment
to
another
when
bedtime
came
asmussen
had
lilly
carry
to
the
compartment
farthest
from
the
hall
door
two
pieces
of
furniture
and
mount
a
on
them
this
completely
blocked
the
space
crosswise
so
that
to
get
into
bed
lilly
had
to
jump
over
the
bottom
rail
of
the
benches
she
thought
it
great
sport
wedged
in
between
perpendicular
bookcases
the
at
her
head
a
chair
holding
her
impedimenta
at
her
feet
the
song
of
songs
clasped
in
her
arms
lilly
fell
asleep
the
next
morning
her
apprenticeship
began
lilly
was
instructed
as
to
the
system
according
to
which
the
thousands
of
volumes
were
ranged
on
the
shelves
as
she
knew
her
a
b
c
she
would
have
been
able
to
fetch
any
book
from
its
place
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
if
only
asmussen
had
followed
her
own
scheme
and
not
produced
utter
confusion
by
disposing
the
books
arbitrarily
still
harder
a
task
was
finding
records
in
the
large
ledger
here
too
the
plan
was
supposed
to
be
alphabetic
but
some
customers
filled
the
space
allotted
to
them
more
rapidly
than
others
and
when
there
was
no
more
room
asmussen
had
simply
turned
to
the
next
blank
page
regardless
of
alphabetic
succession
the
result
was
such
a
jumble
that
finally
neither
asmussen
nor
her
decamped
daughters
knew
where
to
look
for
what
they
wanted
inspired
by
holy
zeal
lilly
began
the
great
task
of
getting
order
out
of
chaos
this
constituted
her
entire
life
the
very
day
after
her
arrival
asmussen
provided
her
with
some
singular
experiences
during
the
working
hours
the
worthy
dame
had
for
the
most
part
kept
out
of
sight
when
lilly
went
in
for
supper
she
found
her
mistress
dreamily
inclined
over
a
steaming
cup
of
tea
in
a
room
pervaded
by
a
pleasant
aroma
of
lemon
and
rum
i
suffer
very
much
from
a
catarrhal
affection
of
the
mucous
lining
of
my
nose
explained
asmussen
blinking
at
lilly
with
somewhat
watery
grey
eyes
so
i
must
take
some
medicine
which
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
in
the
city
prescribed
for
me
lilly
stirred
her
mush
while
asmussen
sipped
tea
every
now
and
then
giving
vent
to
a
distressed
sigh
have
i
told
you
about
my
daughters
oh
certainly
said
lilly
respectfully
in
the
morning
too
asmussen
had
spoken
of
scarcely
anything
but
those
miserable
creatures
and
the
contemptible
wretch
they
called
father
i
do
think
it
possible
for
you
to
get
even
a
remote
conception
of
the
charm
of
those
two
girls
they
are
my
own
flesh
and
blood
and
modesty
should
forbid
me
to
speak
of
them
this
way
however
from
a
purely
objective
point
of
view
i
may
say
that
never
never
in
the
wide
world
have
i
ever
seen
even
from
afar
two
young
ladies
endowed
with
such
striking
qualities
of
mind
and
character
such
tender
filial
devotion
such
industry
such
touching
modesty
so
much
genuine
feeling
in
all
the
small
relations
of
life
such
quiet
strength
in
the
judgment
of
great
questions
have
never
before
i
warrant
been
united
in
two
such
youthful
souls
let
them
be
an
example
to
you
my
child
you
are
far
removed
far
far
removed
from
those
models
of
maidenhood
in
her
astonishment
and
shame
lilly
dropped
her
spoon
the
old
lady
went
on
it
was
with
a
bleeding
heart
that
i
had
to
part
from
them
as
for
them
they
cried
day
and
night
before
leaving
me
but
what
was
to
be
done
they
had
to
go
to
their
father
have
i
ever
told
you
about
my
splendid
husband
an
untoward
destiny
has
separated
us
but
his
love
i
know
clings
to
me
and
i
will
love
him
all
the
days
of
my
life
oh
what
a
man
he
was
my
child
pray
to
the
lord
that
he
may
make
you
worthy
to
become
the
wife
of
such
a
man
alas
i
was
not
worthy
no
not
i
two
tears
of
infinite
contrition
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
related
a
good
deal
more
on
this
second
evening
concerning
the
virtues
of
her
two
daughters
her
husband
nobility
of
character
and
her
own
unworthiness
after
she
had
taken
several
more
doses
of
the
medicine
prescribed
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
of
the
city
she
finally
wept
herself
to
sleep
the
next
morning
she
began
the
day
work
by
bursting
into
a
rage
because
lilly
had
used
the
broom
which
was
to
remain
undisturbed
behind
the
door
for
sweeping
the
library
this
broom
is
here
for
only
one
purpose
to
beat
those
two
monsters
when
they
come
to
my
door
and
if
you
wretched
creature
take
hold
of
it
once
again
you
will
be
the
first
to
make
its
acquaintance
lilly
now
began
to
divine
that
the
strange
world
was
not
so
roseate
as
her
eagerness
for
experience
had
led
her
to
picture
it
but
worse
was
to
come
asmussen
who
seemed
to
be
greatly
concerned
for
the
salvation
of
lilly
soul
and
the
purity
of
her
virgin
fancy
immediately
forbade
her
to
read
any
of
the
books
in
the
library
experience
with
my
daughters
she
said
taught
me
where
such
misconduct
leads
and
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
are
spared
a
similar
fate
so
long
as
the
work
of
ordering
the
books
and
the
ledger
continued
the
temptation
to
disobey
this
mandate
did
not
arise
very
frequently
but
when
fall
came
when
despite
increase
of
custom
unoccupied
hours
grew
more
frequent
and
the
lamp
hanging
over
the
counter
shone
invitingly
when
asmussen
from
day
to
day
succumbed
earlier
to
the
effects
of
the
medicine
prescribed
by
one
of
the
most
eminent
physicians
in
the
city
and
fell
into
an
untroubled
dream
existence
curiosity
and
loneliness
drove
lilly
irresistibly
on
to
commit
the
sinful
deed
the
final
impulse
was
given
by
a
girl
of
about
her
own
age
who
had
come
one
rainy
october
evening
to
exchange
the
first
volume
of
a
novel
for
the
second
but
the
second
had
been
loaned
already
and
the
girl
actually
cried
in
disappointment
she
could
bear
waiting
she
said
she
to
know
how
the
story
ended
she
would
if
she
did
lilly
advised
her
to
go
to
one
of
the
other
circulating
libraries
which
were
said
to
be
larger
and
more
aristocratic
she
even
returned
the
three
marks
deposit
for
use
at
the
other
place
happy
in
reawakened
hopes
the
left
lilly
examined
the
torn
and
soiled
volume
on
all
sides
and
took
a
cautious
peep
between
the
covers
und
by
gustav
freytag
was
on
the
title
page
she
recalled
that
even
the
girls
of
the
first
year
high
school
had
gone
into
raptures
over
the
book
but
the
seamstress
daughter
had
had
no
time
for
reading
novels
lilly
glanced
timidly
at
the
first
page
then
slipped
to
the
glass
door
and
listened
for
a
while
to
asmussen
peaceful
breathing
now
with
sails
spread
she
launched
forth
on
the
high
seas
of
romance
when
she
finished
the
volume
at
four
in
the
morning
she
could
have
torn
her
hair
in
sheer
desperation
at
having
so
lightly
put
the
sequel
into
the
hands
of
some
stranger
who
might
not
bring
it
back
she
mapped
out
ways
and
means
of
unearthing
his
name
and
address
and
slipping
to
him
secretly
in
order
to
hasten
the
return
of
the
book
then
she
fell
asleep
she
spent
hours
going
over
the
ledger
time
and
again
to
find
the
name
in
vain
the
entries
were
made
by
numbers
not
by
titles
and
each
time
she
skipped
the
number
of
und
so
like
a
toper
who
seeks
intoxication
in
a
new
drink
she
greedily
devoured
another
book
from
now
on
lilly
life
was
one
great
orgy
and
bore
all
the
marks
of
such
an
existence
blurred
eyes
aching
limbs
huge
bills
for
midnight
oil
and
spying
and
lying
every
few
minutes
to
allay
suspicions
one
winter
morning
the
dreadful
crime
came
to
light
the
fire
in
the
library
stove
would
die
out
about
midnight
and
feet
would
then
grow
cold
so
she
got
into
the
habit
of
reading
in
bed
with
the
lamp
which
she
removed
from
its
hanging
socket
set
on
the
broad
directly
back
of
her
head
she
indulged
in
the
luxury
even
though
reduced
to
the
bitter
necessity
of
getting
out
of
bed
later
to
replace
both
the
lamp
and
the
book
for
nowadays
asmussen
was
frequently
at
her
post
earlier
in
the
morning
than
lilly
but
lilly
for
the
sake
of
the
few
extra
hours
thus
gained
would
not
have
been
deterred
from
allowing
herself
this
great
joy
even
if
it
had
involved
going
out
on
the
icy
street
in
her
nightgown
but
once
she
started
up
from
sleep
in
terror
to
find
asmussen
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
bed
all
dressed
a
black
strap
lay
across
her
white
shirt
and
the
lamp
which
she
had
gotten
up
at
one
to
refill
was
still
burning
behind
her
never
having
been
beaten
in
her
life
she
refused
at
first
to
take
it
seriously
when
asmussen
despite
her
corpulence
suddenly
jumped
over
the
bottom
of
the
bed
and
squatted
on
the
covers
like
a
great
turkey
and
began
to
strike
her
over
the
ears
with
the
black
strap
bad
times
set
in
of
what
avail
that
lilly
felt
genuinely
repentant
and
swore
to
herself
to
reform
she
was
so
steeped
in
the
new
passion
so
absorbed
by
that
lovelier
existence
where
people
experienced
and
loved
suffered
and
enjoyed
where
there
were
no
pert
servant
girls
who
came
to
exchange
books
no
wet
umbrellas
no
second
volumes
loaned
out
no
ledger
numbers
not
to
be
found
no
mush
and
no
blows
that
she
could
not
have
returned
to
her
former
self
had
she
had
the
ability
of
a
martyr
and
saint
to
such
an
extent
was
she
dominated
by
her
fancy
that
what
was
her
actual
existence
moving
on
from
day
to
day
in
monotonous
loneliness
seemed
to
her
a
dream
an
oppressive
death
stupour
painless
but
also
pleasureless
her
being
did
not
expand
in
real
life
until
the
sticky
pages
of
a
novel
began
to
rustle
in
her
hand
intimidated
and
unresisting
as
she
was
she
did
not
find
the
courage
to
justify
what
was
holiest
to
her
even
in
her
own
eyes
she
felt
it
to
be
a
sin
on
which
her
hungry
soul
fed
as
on
manna
asmussen
had
bethought
herself
of
a
diabolic
way
of
still
further
humiliating
lilly
like
many
a
believing
protestant
she
regarded
religion
solely
as
a
scourge
hitherto
she
had
not
shown
the
least
solicitude
concerning
lilly
piety
but
now
she
began
each
meal
with
a
long
prayer
of
repentance
and
while
the
steam
curled
invitingly
from
the
soup
tureen
she
would
beseech
god
with
sighs
and
tears
to
raise
lilly
from
the
depths
to
which
she
had
sunk
and
woe
to
lilly
if
caught
backsliding
that
first
chastisement
was
not
the
last
every
pretext
was
seized
for
beating
and
cuffing
her
storms
of
abuse
showered
down
on
her
unprotected
head
she
did
not
dare
breathe
until
the
medicine
prescribed
by
the
eminent
physician
began
to
have
its
soothing
effect
then
she
would
pounce
on
the
first
book
she
came
across
and
amid
the
forging
of
signatures
and
broken
marriage
vows
amid
death
by
poisoning
and
the
mad
acts
of
love
she
would
suffer
and
triumph
triumph
and
die
blissful
in
her
sufferings
intoxicated
to
the
very
end
chapter
vii
it
was
on
a
march
afternoon
when
the
sun
was
shining
with
young
impertinence
and
the
heat
was
untimely
the
black
slabs
of
snow
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
had
melted
into
gleaming
puddles
and
a
sparkling
shower
fell
from
the
icicles
clinging
to
the
roofs
over
to
the
the
red
evening
glow
lay
spread
on
the
house
fronts
like
gay
rugs
separated
by
an
oblique
line
from
the
shadow
of
the
walls
on
the
near
side
the
glowed
as
if
they
were
suns
radiating
their
own
light
and
the
sparrows
chased
one
another
along
the
dripping
eaves
but
best
of
all
in
this
sorry
spring
of
city
streets
was
the
rare
spicy
smell
of
thawing
even
the
vapours
rising
from
the
gutters
now
running
again
gave
an
inkling
of
greening
meadows
and
bursting
boughs
lilly
who
had
gone
out
on
hardly
more
than
three
occasions
the
whole
winter
sat
behind
the
counter
and
looked
through
the
window
longingly
everywhere
she
saw
that
windows
and
doors
had
been
opened
wide
everywhere
breasts
hungering
for
air
greedily
drew
in
the
breath
of
coming
spring
so
she
too
opened
the
casement
wide
and
gave
the
door
to
the
hall
a
push
which
sent
it
flying
back
and
knocked
down
the
broom
standing
at
its
post
as
always
through
the
open
doorway
she
could
see
into
the
parlour
of
the
tenant
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
and
who
likewise
had
flung
back
his
door
for
spring
to
enter
she
saw
a
sofa
with
embroidered
antimacassars
symmetrically
plastered
on
its
scroll
arms
she
saw
framed
wreaths
of
dried
flowers
with
inscriptions
hanging
on
the
walls
she
saw
an
artillery
officer
helmet
and
two
swords
with
crossed
beneath
she
saw
china
lions
serving
as
cigar
holders
ladies
in
dancing
attitudes
holding
tallow
candles
photographs
of
family
groups
with
peacock
feathers
stuck
behind
a
spherical
aquarium
containing
gold
fish
and
a
spotted
goat
skin
amid
all
these
she
saw
a
young
man
walking
up
and
down
with
a
book
in
his
hand
murmuring
studiously
he
would
appear
and
reappear
in
the
field
of
vision
allowed
by
the
hall
door
this
young
man
awakened
lilly
sympathy
at
the
very
first
glance
he
wore
his
waving
light
hair
brushed
from
his
forehead
in
free
and
easy
fashion
and
carried
his
head
boldly
erect
his
brown
and
lilac
necktie
seemed
to
her
aristocratic
perfection
she
passed
in
review
all
her
favourite
heroes
to
see
which
of
them
he
most
resembled
after
some
wavering
she
finally
decided
he
came
nearest
to
herr
von
fink
the
rogue
in
und
since
the
young
man
did
not
notice
her
she
could
study
him
at
leisure
each
time
he
appeared
she
felt
a
warm
wave
pour
over
her
body
and
when
he
remained
away
too
long
by
the
fraction
of
a
second
she
experienced
a
sensation
of
nausea
as
if
some
one
were
trying
to
cheat
her
of
a
dear
possession
this
continued
until
once
he
looked
up
from
his
book
became
aware
of
the
open
door
to
the
circulating
library
with
the
young
lady
on
the
other
side
observing
him
started
in
dismay
and
quickly
stepped
back
to
the
invisible
part
of
the
room
the
next
time
he
came
into
view
he
had
assumed
a
conscious
and
studied
manner
he
looked
at
his
book
a
little
too
closely
and
moved
his
lips
one
degree
too
zealously
while
a
severe
frown
clouded
his
countenance
lilly
too
had
found
it
necessary
somewhat
to
improve
the
picture
she
presented
she
smoothed
her
hair
which
she
wore
parted
madonna
fashion
and
let
her
arm
droop
over
the
side
of
the
chair
in
idle
dreaminess
some
maids
who
had
come
to
exchange
books
for
their
mistresses
put
an
end
to
this
dual
posing
on
leaving
they
closed
the
door
and
lilly
did
not
venture
to
open
it
again
but
that
night
she
carried
the
vision
of
the
new
hero
into
her
dreams
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
to
speak
to
asmussen
who
was
now
in
the
habit
of
preparing
her
medicine
some
time
before
the
evening
meal
the
next
morning
however
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
gracious
humour
and
lilly
felt
emboldened
to
make
a
few
inquiries
concerning
the
neighbours
of
whom
she
knew
practically
nothing
what
are
the
neighbours
to
you
miss
inquisitive
such
was
the
tone
of
intercourse
that
had
developed
from
the
first
state
of
enchantment
lilly
took
heart
and
concocted
a
story
of
a
steady
customer
who
had
asked
about
the
neighbours
the
day
before
and
lilly
had
not
been
able
to
give
any
information
asmussen
who
cherished
boundless
respect
for
the
wishes
forthwith
became
communicative
they
were
two
very
good
people
but
of
low
station
with
whom
she
asmussen
a
woman
of
greater
aristocracy
both
of
mind
and
heart
could
not
of
course
associate
the
man
a
sergeant
out
of
service
was
clerk
in
some
office
and
the
woman
sewed
neckwear
for
a
living
lilly
blushed
she
recalled
the
brown
and
lilac
tie
the
sheen
of
which
had
been
dazzling
her
eyes
since
the
day
before
an
idea
might
be
obtained
of
the
vulgar
existence
those
plebeians
led
asmussen
continued
if
one
knew
they
considered
potato
soup
with
sliced
sausage
in
it
a
festal
delicacy
whereas
anyone
with
refined
tastes
would
shudder
at
the
mere
thought
lilly
who
like
the
daughters
had
long
lost
her
joy
in
the
daily
mush
could
not
quite
sympathise
with
this
statement
on
the
contrary
she
felt
her
mouth
watering
and
in
order
to
change
the
subject
quickly
she
timidly
inquired
whether
anyone
else
was
living
next
door
not
that
i
know
of
replied
asmussen
but
there
a
son
he
goes
to
high
school
i
do
know
why
such
people
have
their
sons
study
i
know
thought
lilly
because
he
one
of
the
elect
because
genius
shines
in
his
eyes
because
destiny
has
marked
him
to
be
a
ruler
on
earth
that
afternoon
she
kept
the
door
open
but
it
had
turned
bitter
cold
and
the
idea
of
friendly
reciprocation
occurred
to
nobody
next
door
after
an
hour
spent
in
studying
the
oval
door
plate
on
which
was
inscribed
redlich
please
ring
hard
she
found
herself
under
the
necessity
of
closing
the
door
because
her
legs
were
depending
from
her
body
like
icicles
and
she
had
the
humiliating
consciousness
of
being
scorned
henceforth
she
kept
on
the
watch
for
one
when
the
students
living
in
the
house
returned
from
school
holding
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
she
could
recognise
at
an
inconceivable
distance
the
blue
and
white
rimmed
caps
worn
by
high
school
students
when
he
came
up
the
steps
leading
to
the
porch
in
front
of
the
house
she
slipped
behind
the
curtain
and
in
a
joyous
tremour
caught
the
shamed
sidelong
glance
he
sent
her
if
he
looked
straight
ahead
she
was
unhappy
and
afraid
she
had
hurt
his
feelings
other
blue
and
white
rimmed
caps
besides
his
entered
the
house
they
belonged
to
friends
who
came
to
cram
with
him
lilly
loved
them
all
she
felt
she
was
a
secret
member
of
the
union
of
these
young
souls
who
were
going
to
storm
the
world
and
when
they
seated
themselves
in
the
room
she
took
her
invisible
place
in
the
circle
some
of
them
lilly
recognised
not
by
their
features
because
they
passed
her
too
quickly
for
that
but
by
their
caps
which
she
distinguished
accurately
there
was
the
sad
one
the
one
the
stylish
one
and
the
wireless
one
she
could
also
recognise
their
walk
and
the
manner
in
which
they
rang
the
bell
at
the
opposite
door
even
if
occupied
with
customers
she
could
tell
without
having
looked
through
the
window
exactly
how
many
and
which
of
the
friends
were
working
with
young
redlich
and
she
would
revolve
in
her
mind
why
this
or
that
one
had
not
come
that
day
spring
advanced
the
inmates
of
the
house
began
occasionally
to
sit
on
the
front
porch
where
there
were
benches
on
either
side
of
the
door
before
leaving
the
young
gentlemen
would
remain
there
a
while
chatting
and
now
and
then
he
would
lean
over
the
railing
in
the
twilight
dreaming
no
doubt
of
future
conquests
with
fluttering
heart
lilly
would
stand
behind
a
bookcase
where
she
had
cunningly
contrived
an
observatory
for
herself
by
removing
a
number
of
books
and
from
there
read
the
thoughts
that
lay
on
the
bold
soaring
forehead
the
benches
on
the
right
side
of
the
porch
in
front
of
the
windows
of
the
circulating
library
generally
remained
unoccupied
because
asmussen
to
whom
this
side
belonged
preferred
not
to
desert
her
evening
medicine
and
lilly
lacked
courage
to
ask
for
permission
to
sit
there
by
herself
but
one
evening
in
may
when
dark
blue
clouds
hung
in
the
heavens
shot
with
red
enticing
rather
than
threatening
when
the
streets
were
so
quiet
that
lilly
could
hear
the
distant
plashing
of
the
fountain
in
the
when
the
only
stir
was
created
by
swallows
darting
hither
and
thither
she
could
no
longer
stand
the
library
pasty
leathery
smell
and
fetching
her
embroidery
more
for
show
than
from
eagerness
to
sew
she
went
out
to
sit
on
the
porch
she
knew
he
had
gone
out
and
was
not
in
the
habit
of
remaining
away
after
ten
so
he
would
be
bound
to
pass
her
at
all
events
half
an
hour
went
by
another
half
hour
then
a
quarter
of
an
hour
finally
she
saw
a
blue
and
white
cap
come
swinging
down
the
street
in
the
last
glow
of
evening
her
first
thought
was
to
run
into
the
library
with
all
possible
speed
but
she
was
ashamed
of
the
idea
and
remained
seated
he
came
he
saw
her
he
raised
his
cap
and
went
in
she
thought
gleefully
well
he
bowed
at
last
at
the
end
of
scarcely
ten
minutes
he
reappeared
on
the
scene
seated
himself
on
the
bench
belonging
to
side
of
the
house
toyed
with
pebbles
whistled
softly
and
acted
altogether
as
if
he
did
not
see
her
lilly
sat
in
her
corner
with
her
face
turned
aside
rolling
and
unrolling
her
embroidery
and
every
now
and
then
fetching
a
little
sigh
not
to
show
her
love
oh
certainly
not
but
because
her
breath
came
short
about
half
an
hour
passed
in
this
fashion
and
lilly
was
beginning
to
lose
all
hope
of
a
rapprochement
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
half
raising
his
cap
the
front
door
i
believe
is
soon
going
to
be
closed
miss
impossible
she
cried
feigning
lively
astonishment
but
if
she
were
to
act
on
the
suggestion
implied
in
his
words
her
chance
of
at
last
becoming
acquainted
with
him
would
certainly
be
lost
and
she
added
in
a
tone
lighter
than
accorded
with
her
mood
but
it
does
matter
the
window
is
open
he
uttered
h
h
whether
in
agreement
or
blame
she
could
not
determine
and
the
conversation
would
have
come
to
a
standstill
without
fail
had
not
lilly
made
an
effort
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
we
are
neighbours
are
we
she
asked
he
jumped
from
his
seat
and
with
a
sweep
of
his
cap
describing
a
semicircle
between
his
head
and
his
trousers
pocket
he
said
permit
me
to
introduce
myself
fritz
redlich
senior
in
the
high
school
lilly
once
more
experienced
the
reverential
thrill
that
used
to
pass
through
her
soul
when
she
was
in
the
selecta
and
the
last
year
class
of
the
boys
high
school
was
mentioned
the
fact
was
suddenly
borne
in
upon
her
that
now
she
was
nothing
better
than
a
shop
girl
and
she
grew
hot
with
shame
at
the
thought
but
she
would
not
have
it
that
her
glorious
past
was
to
have
been
lived
in
vain
i
was
in
the
selecta
i
left
last
autumn
she
said
and
i
got
to
know
some
of
you
then
whom
he
asked
eagerly
lilly
mentioned
the
names
of
two
young
men
who
had
fluttered
about
her
at
the
and
asked
whether
he
knew
them
certainly
not
he
answered
with
scorn
which
did
not
seem
wholly
sincere
they
loaf
too
much
for
fellows
like
us
and
they
going
to
join
a
students
corps
we
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
silence
ensued
it
had
now
grown
so
dark
that
lilly
could
see
only
the
outline
of
his
figure
as
he
idly
leaned
against
the
corner
post
of
the
balustrade
fine
drops
of
rain
fell
and
lay
in
her
hair
she
could
have
remained
there
forever
with
the
dark
youthful
form
before
her
searching
eyes
and
spring
blessing
lying
cool
on
her
head
you
are
engaged
here
in
the
circulating
library
he
asked
lilly
said
yes
and
was
grateful
to
him
for
the
elegant
word
engaged
which
seemed
somewhat
to
improve
her
position
and
you
are
preparing
for
the
examinations
she
inquired
in
turn
in
autumn
if
everything
goes
well
he
answered
with
a
sigh
then
you
are
going
out
into
the
wide
wide
world
she
said
with
the
rapt
expression
that
girls
adopt
in
compositions
going
out
to
fight
your
way
through
life
oh
how
i
envy
you
why
he
asked
in
wonder
are
you
fighting
your
way
through
life
already
lilly
burst
out
laughing
oh
if
i
were
you
she
cried
what
would
i
do
oh
she
exulted
in
her
sensations
she
felt
her
limbs
stretching
she
knew
a
gleam
of
triumph
was
flashing
in
her
eyes
a
gleam
which
could
not
triumph
simply
because
it
dissipated
itself
unseen
in
the
dark
it
was
impossible
for
her
from
sheer
joy
to
remain
where
she
was
she
would
have
gone
mad
had
she
been
compelled
to
stay
there
formulating
stiff
words
while
everything
in
her
cried
out
i
love
you
she
bade
him
a
hasty
and
ran
into
the
library
bolting
the
door
behind
her
she
ran
up
and
down
the
narrow
aisles
between
the
cases
laughing
and
sighing
raising
her
arms
aloft
like
a
priestess
at
prayer
and
knocking
her
elbows
painfully
against
the
shelves
a
yearning
for
symphonies
for
great
sustained
major
chords
welled
up
within
her
she
wanted
to
sing
the
walhalla
motif
but
the
walhalla
motif
can
not
be
sung
suddenly
an
aria
flitted
through
her
mind
one
of
those
songs
which
had
palpitated
through
her
childhood
without
conveying
any
meaning
to
her
but
which
for
that
very
reason
had
been
the
more
purely
consecrated
i
sought
him
whom
my
soul
loved
i
sought
him
but
i
found
him
not
i
called
him
but
he
gave
me
no
answer
the
watchman
that
went
about
the
city
found
me
they
smote
me
they
wounded
me
the
keepers
of
the
walls
took
away
my
veil
from
me
she
sang
in
a
soft
uncertain
voice
loud
enough
however
to
be
heard
through
the
window
but
when
she
peeped
from
her
observatory
to
convince
herself
that
he
was
listening
she
no
longer
saw
him
standing
there
she
sang
louder
and
leaned
out
she
tore
open
her
dress
to
expose
her
bare
breast
to
the
rain
drops
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
was
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
wretchedness
why
she
did
not
know
but
so
strong
it
was
she
thought
she
would
die
of
it
she
felt
how
the
cruel
watchers
seized
her
she
felt
the
smart
of
the
wound
which
rude
hands
caused
her
she
felt
how
the
veil
was
being
torn
away
which
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
holy
nakedness
of
her
body
in
shameless
nudity
yet
weeping
drops
of
blood
for
bitter
shame
she
tottered
through
the
streets
and
sought
and
sought
yet
was
farther
off
than
ever
she
sank
on
her
knees
at
the
and
pressing
her
face
on
its
edge
wept
bitterly
in
sweet
dark
sympathy
with
that
image
of
herself
straying
through
jerusalem
nocturnal
streets
yet
all
this
was
sheer
happiness
chapter
viii
and
the
happiness
endured
it
nestled
in
the
dusty
corners
it
perched
on
the
bookshelves
it
span
golden
cobwebs
from
beam
to
beam
it
rode
on
every
ray
of
light
reflected
from
the
windows
opposite
on
the
leather
backs
of
the
books
wherever
she
went
lilly
was
accompanied
by
a
humming
medley
of
quivering
tones
half
motifs
and
snatches
of
melodies
strains
from
an
æolian
harp
the
chirping
of
a
the
singing
of
a
boiling
kettle
and
the
soft
twittering
of
birds
awake
or
asleep
she
always
heard
it
now
and
then
a
few
measures
of
the
song
of
songs
joined
in
exultingly
outwardly
everything
went
along
in
the
old
ruts
asmussen
was
sometimes
sober
sometimes
full
of
sweet
drugs
husband
and
daughters
rose
and
sank
sank
and
rose
through
the
entire
gamut
of
ethical
appraisement
plunged
one
moment
into
the
deepest
pit
of
depravity
exalted
the
next
to
the
shining
heights
of
apotheosis
one
day
a
volume
of
gerstäcker
was
missing
another
day
a
balduin
möllhausen
seemed
to
have
been
sucked
into
the
swamps
of
the
orinoco
sometimes
a
puff
of
wind
blowing
through
the
window
carried
a
little
cloud
of
yellow
powder
to
the
edges
of
the
shelves
from
which
it
was
wiped
off
like
ordinary
dust
yet
it
conveyed
a
greeting
from
swaying
boughs
in
bloom
which
was
all
this
spring
brought
to
lilly
except
for
a
loads
of
lilacs
carted
past
the
library
on
their
way
to
market
the
young
hero
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
had
not
approached
her
again
she
trembled
whenever
she
heard
him
go
down
the
steps
and
twice
a
day
with
beating
heart
she
received
his
shy
greeting
that
was
all
and
he
was
not
to
be
seen
on
the
porch
again
the
digging
and
cramming
with
the
other
young
men
lasted
until
late
at
night
and
it
was
often
two
before
she
heard
their
departing
tread
not
until
then
would
she
throw
herself
in
bed
where
she
lay
staring
into
the
dusk
of
the
summer
night
her
spirit
roving
over
the
world
to
find
throne
worthy
to
serve
as
her
hero
goal
she
saw
him
a
general
winning
battles
in
the
open
country
she
saw
him
a
poet
walking
up
the
steps
of
the
capitol
to
receive
the
laurel
wreath
she
saw
him
an
inventor
soaring
through
the
ether
in
the
airship
he
himself
had
perfected
she
saw
him
the
founder
of
a
new
religion
but
here
she
came
to
a
terrified
halt
for
in
her
heart
she
had
remained
a
good
catholic
under
the
oppression
of
bodily
and
spiritual
castigation
she
had
not
dared
seek
refuge
in
religion
quickly
enough
the
courage
had
gone
from
her
to
ask
asmussen
for
permission
to
visit
anne
early
every
morning
and
soon
she
had
completely
forgotten
that
such
a
thing
as
a
confession
or
a
mass
ever
took
place
now
however
in
the
exuberance
of
her
feelings
feelings
such
as
she
had
never
before
suspected
her
longing
for
spiritual
disburdenment
grew
so
strong
that
she
decided
to
acknowledge
her
catholicism
to
asmussen
and
beg
for
the
privilege
to
pray
in
that
quiet
corner
where
joseph
who
had
always
been
good
to
her
stood
behind
six
candles
and
smilingly
shook
his
finger
in
lilly
avowal
asmussen
found
an
explanation
of
all
her
vices
her
sneakiness
her
hypocrisy
her
laziness
her
lack
of
a
sense
of
order
asmussen
therefore
concluded
her
daily
prayer
with
the
wish
for
immediate
and
complete
conversion
nevertheless
she
did
not
refuse
lilly
two
excursions
a
week
to
early
mass
which
was
all
lilly
had
dared
hope
for
the
meeting
between
lilly
and
joseph
was
touching
really
going
back
to
him
was
like
going
back
home
the
cherubs
that
fluttered
in
the
gay
glass
case
behind
him
greeted
her
with
a
knowing
confidential
look
like
brothers
and
sisters
who
have
been
let
into
the
secret
that
the
punishment
after
all
is
not
going
to
be
so
very
severe
the
carpet
extended
a
hospitable
invitation
to
kneel
and
the
flowers
on
the
holy
virgin
altar
close
by
perfumed
the
air
the
saint
at
first
seemed
a
little
hurt
because
she
had
not
visited
him
for
so
long
but
after
she
had
made
her
moan
telling
of
her
loneliness
the
daily
mush
and
the
blows
he
softened
and
forgave
her
since
her
last
visit
he
had
received
three
new
silver
hearts
which
shot
out
rays
of
light
the
length
of
a
finger
she
felt
like
dedicating
one
to
him
too
but
on
what
grounds
she
did
not
know
since
the
miracle
to
be
worked
in
her
was
yet
to
be
accomplished
perhaps
it
only
jealousy
in
me
or
a
desire
to
show
off
she
thought
for
it
was
painful
to
her
that
others
should
stand
in
closer
relations
to
her
saint
than
she
after
all
she
comforted
herself
how
can
i
expect
anything
else
when
i
neglected
him
so
long
after
confessing
everything
except
of
course
her
love
story
he
had
become
too
much
of
a
stranger
for
she
hastened
away
the
clocks
were
striking
quarter
of
seven
and
if
she
did
not
meet
her
hero
on
his
way
to
school
her
morning
meditations
would
have
had
neither
purpose
nor
significance
she
met
him
and
his
companions
at
the
corner
of
wassertor
street
he
raised
his
cap
and
passed
by
but
she
fetching
a
deep
breath
remained
for
a
time
on
the
same
spot
like
one
who
has
just
escaped
a
great
danger
from
now
on
there
were
two
such
encounters
a
week
her
secret
wish
that
some
morning
when
he
was
alone
he
would
stop
and
enter
into
a
neighbourly
conversation
was
never
fulfilled
not
the
faintest
glimmer
of
joy
appeared
in
his
face
at
her
approach
and
the
tense
concern
depicted
on
his
features
did
not
relax
even
when
blushing
a
bit
he
raised
his
cap
to
her
lilly
had
long
given
up
all
hope
of
his
ever
addressing
her
again
when
one
rainy
july
sunday
in
the
evening
when
the
door
of
the
circulating
library
was
closed
to
customers
she
heard
a
faint
tinkling
of
the
bell
she
opened
the
door
there
stood
mercy
she
cried
almost
shutting
the
door
in
her
confusion
did
she
happen
to
have
rückert
poems
in
her
library
lilly
knew
for
certain
she
did
have
them
but
if
she
admitted
forthwith
her
inability
to
furnish
the
book
he
would
find
no
pretext
for
entering
into
a
conversation
so
she
said
she
would
go
see
and
he
step
in
and
wait
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
seated
himself
on
the
customers
chair
placed
close
to
the
door
lilly
spent
some
time
searching
because
she
was
afraid
the
inevitable
no
would
send
him
off
with
a
curt
thank
you
and
she
ran
up
and
down
the
aisles
between
the
shelves
aimlessly
reiterating
i
sure
i
saw
the
poems
just
a
little
while
ago
then
in
order
to
think
the
matter
over
more
quietly
she
seated
herself
opposite
him
with
the
counter
between
but
he
encouraged
her
to
renew
the
search
if
you
saw
them
only
a
short
time
ago
then
they
are
bound
to
be
here
when
finally
convinced
that
rückert
poems
were
not
in
the
library
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
and
murmured
something
like
what
shall
i
do
and
disappeared
lilly
completely
dazed
stared
at
the
doorway
which
a
moment
before
had
framed
his
figure
she
wanted
to
cry
out
and
plead
stay
here
come
back
but
she
heard
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
fall
shut
and
everything
was
over
she
crouched
at
the
indulging
in
speculations
of
what
have
taken
place
if
he
had
happened
to
remain
her
heart
throbbed
violently
about
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
bell
rang
again
she
jumped
up
supposing
it
was
he
it
was
he
he
begged
pardon
he
had
forgotten
his
umbrella
this
time
you
do
slip
away
something
within
her
cried
he
caught
up
his
soaking
umbrella
which
she
had
failed
to
notice
despite
the
shining
puddle
which
was
crawling
along
the
crack
between
two
floor
boards
and
was
about
to
escape
again
when
lilly
essayed
for
what
do
you
need
rückert
poems
he
began
to
complain
life
is
made
so
hard
for
us
you
have
no
idea
how
hard
he
went
on
to
tell
about
the
speeches
they
had
to
deliver
offhand
on
a
subject
sprung
on
them
without
warning
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
students
had
prepared
the
theme
but
this
time
they
had
gotten
wind
of
the
surprise
in
store
the
next
day
in
literature
class
they
would
be
required
to
give
a
comprehensive
view
of
rückert
that
was
why
he
would
have
to
glance
over
the
poems
once
again
to
find
out
exactly
who
had
been
buried
in
the
three
graves
at
ottensen
lilly
thrilled
with
joy
could
help
him
she
the
sparrow
could
help
the
soaring
she
timorously
related
the
story
of
the
poor
defeated
count
of
brunswick
and
klopstock
the
pious
bard
of
the
messiah
the
only
thing
she
had
forgotten
was
who
the
twelve
hundred
exiles
were
who
lay
in
the
first
of
the
graves
he
seemed
unwilling
to
believe
in
this
unexpected
good
fortune
was
she
sure
of
what
she
said
that
about
klopstock
was
correct
he
knew
it
from
the
tables
of
his
history
of
literature
but
the
rest
of
it
oppressed
by
grave
doubts
he
shook
his
triumphant
mane
lilly
eagerly
allayed
his
fears
to
be
sure
it
was
more
than
a
year
since
she
had
heard
of
those
lovely
things
but
she
had
a
good
memory
and
would
certainly
not
misinform
him
lightly
at
last
he
seemed
relieved
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
observed
with
his
mind
bent
more
upon
general
matters
yes
it
very
hard
very
very
hard
once
embarked
on
the
current
of
open
talk
he
went
on
to
offer
his
views
concerning
the
other
difficulties
of
human
life
mathematics
was
all
right
in
fact
he
had
done
very
well
in
analytic
geometry
but
history
and
the
languages
and
above
all
german
composition
a
fellow
was
sometimes
driven
to
despair
by
the
wretched
state
of
things
in
this
world
in
this
lilly
fully
concurred
she
too
had
little
cause
to
be
satisfied
with
the
course
of
mundane
events
and
she
gave
eloquent
and
passionate
expression
to
her
sentiments
as
for
you
she
concluded
what
tortures
your
spirit
must
undergo
when
it
feels
itself
hampered
in
its
flight
by
the
humiliating
demands
of
the
schoolroom
he
looked
at
her
in
some
wonderment
and
remarked
yes
indeed
it
hard
very
hard
i
in
your
place
lilly
went
on
would
not
care
a
fig
inside
myself
for
all
that
vapid
stuff
i
would
just
do
what
is
necessary
in
an
offhand
way
and
then
in
complete
spiritual
freedom
climb
to
the
height
where
the
great
poets
and
philosophers
dwell
yes
but
the
examinations
he
exclaimed
utterly
horrified
oh
those
stupid
examinations
she
rejoined
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
or
not
you
pass
here
he
became
eager
you
do
understand
at
all
not
at
all
examinations
are
in
a
sense
the
avenue
leading
to
every
good
position
in
life
no
matter
whether
you
enter
the
university
or
study
architecture
or
merely
try
for
a
good
place
in
the
postal
service
but
that
of
course
i
would
do
a
man
like
you
she
interrupted
he
smiled
faintly
feeling
stroked
the
right
way
i
do
want
to
storm
the
heavens
exactly
he
said
but
i
have
my
ambitions
what
would
a
fellow
be
if
he
had
no
ambitions
that
is
so
is
it
lilly
cried
looking
up
to
him
with
a
grateful
gleam
in
her
eyes
the
feeling
that
she
had
never
experienced
such
an
hour
of
joy
took
complete
hold
of
her
when
he
arose
to
go
it
had
grown
quite
dark
she
felt
actual
physical
pain
as
if
a
piece
of
her
body
were
being
torn
from
her
he
had
almost
closed
the
door
when
he
turned
and
said
as
one
who
wishes
to
be
sure
where
he
treads
if
it
not
troubling
you
too
much
do
hunt
for
the
poems
once
more
perhaps
you
will
find
them
turning
back
a
second
time
you
might
lay
the
book
under
the
if
you
find
it
lilly
hastily
lighted
the
lamp
and
obediently
started
on
the
search
after
a
time
the
futility
of
doing
so
occurred
to
her
he
spent
the
summer
vacation
in
the
country
with
a
companion
in
misery
with
whom
he
crammed
for
the
examinations
the
written
tests
were
to
be
given
immediately
after
the
opening
of
school
and
the
oral
tests
about
the
middle
of
september
the
young
hero
looked
pale
and
exhausted
and
stubble
lay
in
the
hollows
of
his
cheeks
like
blotches
of
blood
lilly
was
unable
to
witness
such
wretchedness
in
silence
and
one
morning
when
returning
from
mass
she
met
him
alone
in
the
deserted
street
she
ventured
to
stop
and
speak
to
him
you
must
spare
yourself
redlich
she
broke
out
anxiously
you
must
keep
well
for
the
sake
of
your
parents
and
those
who
love
you
he
seemed
more
embarrassed
than
pleased
and
before
finding
a
reply
he
cast
rapid
sidelong
glances
in
all
directions
thank
you
he
stammered
but
later
if
you
please
later
he
dashed
past
scarcely
daring
to
raise
his
cap
lilly
realised
she
had
committed
an
indiscretion
the
houses
began
to
dance
before
her
eyes
she
chewed
her
handkerchief
and
feared
the
passersby
might
laugh
and
jeer
at
her
when
ensconced
in
her
corner
behind
the
entry
book
she
no
longer
doubted
that
she
had
lost
him
forever
she
had
he
came
and
went
without
greeting
her
he
came
at
suppertime
and
left
she
heard
his
steps
all
the
way
down
the
street
over
and
done
for
over
and
done
for
but
lo
and
behold
at
dusk
a
knock
was
heard
on
the
door
no
not
exactly
a
knock
rather
a
scratching
at
the
door
the
way
a
dog
with
a
guilty
conscience
scratches
when
he
wants
to
be
let
in
there
he
stood
not
with
the
embarrassed
yet
manner
with
which
he
had
entered
that
sunday
evening
when
the
graves
of
ottensen
had
justified
his
coming
no
this
time
his
heart
throbbed
anxiously
he
was
like
a
thief
who
lacks
skill
in
the
art
of
thieving
is
asmussen
here
he
whispered
asmussen
does
come
in
here
at
this
time
she
whispered
back
with
a
deep
sigh
of
joy
then
may
i
come
in
for
a
moment
she
stepped
aside
and
let
him
enter
thinking
how
can
a
person
endure
so
much
joy
without
dying
of
it
he
stammered
something
about
begging
her
pardon
and
not
answering
her
she
responded
with
something
about
having
reproached
herself
and
having
meant
it
well
then
they
sat
down
opposite
each
other
with
the
counter
between
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
next
he
was
the
first
to
discover
the
way
into
the
region
of
the
permissible
a
fellow
sometimes
likes
to
exchange
thoughts
with
a
congenial
young
lady
he
said
with
an
emphatic
air
of
importance
but
he
seldom
finds
the
time
or
the
opportunity
oh
as
for
the
opportunity
thought
lilly
since
she
had
manifested
such
kindly
interest
in
him
and
since
an
exchange
of
views
would
certainly
be
edifying
to
him
especially
because
of
the
growing
emancipation
of
women
which
he
had
steered
into
a
tight
place
but
his
sense
of
dignity
did
not
forsake
him
he
looked
at
lilly
somewhat
challengingly
as
if
to
say
you
see
how
able
i
am
to
cope
with
this
difficult
situation
lilly
had
not
caught
the
drift
of
his
talk
from
the
moment
she
recovered
her
power
of
thinking
she
was
dominated
by
one
feeling
help
him
save
him
so
that
he
does
work
himself
to
death
once
we
girls
had
a
teacher
she
began
who
delivered
glorious
lectures
in
class
he
worked
too
hard
like
you
and
by
this
time
he
must
certainly
have
died
of
consumption
the
same
will
happen
to
you
if
you
do
take
care
and
go
more
slowly
he
nodded
dejectedly
yes
life
hard
very
hard
you
must
get
enough
sleep
and
go
walking
walking
a
great
deal
is
the
very
best
do
go
walking
lilly
taken
aback
considered
a
moment
since
she
had
been
in
that
hole
among
the
books
she
had
not
seen
a
field
of
snow
or
a
green
tree
oh
i
she
threw
out
shrugging
her
shoulders
what
have
i
got
to
do
with
it
then
inwardly
rejoicing
at
her
own
boldness
she
added
how
would
it
be
if
we
were
to
take
a
walk
together
now
it
was
his
turn
to
be
taken
aback
there
are
such
a
lot
of
obstacles
he
observed
thoughtfully
shaking
his
mane
the
thing
would
be
misinterpreted
there
are
considerations
especially
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
certainly
especially
for
you
lilly
had
read
of
young
cavaliers
whose
solicitude
for
their
lady
good
name
exceeded
their
very
passion
for
her
and
she
looked
up
at
him
in
gratitude
and
admiration
do
bother
about
me
i
manage
i
just
shirk
early
mass
though
she
felt
a
tiny
prick
at
her
heart
because
of
her
blasphemous
words
she
knew
that
for
the
sake
of
such
a
walk
she
would
betray
god
betray
joseph
himself
without
the
least
hesitation
but
i
got
to
get
through
with
the
examinations
first
he
explained
the
matter
was
settled
and
the
plan
sealed
with
mutual
promises
accompanied
by
lilly
good
wishes
and
warnings
he
took
leave
but
not
before
carefully
scanning
street
porch
and
hall
from
now
on
lilly
life
was
one
glow
of
hope
and
dreamy
anticipation
she
would
lie
awake
half
the
night
picturing
to
herself
how
she
would
wander
over
the
golden
meadows
with
him
in
the
light
of
dawn
her
hand
pressed
against
her
throbbing
heart
her
arm
now
and
then
slightly
grazing
his
elbow
each
time
she
thought
of
this
she
felt
a
little
shock
which
quivered
down
to
the
very
tips
of
her
toes
she
read
nothing
but
hot
passionate
books
in
which
there
was
much
of
intoxication
transport
and
the
giddiness
of
endless
kisses
but
she
did
not
dream
of
kisses
in
connection
with
herself
whenever
she
found
herself
drifting
in
that
direction
she
checked
herself
in
dismay
so
exalted
was
he
above
every
earthly
desire
now
she
knew
what
reasons
justified
her
in
promising
joseph
a
silver
heart
one
sunday
morning
she
told
joseph
the
whole
story
about
fritz
redlich
examinations
his
high
ideals
and
her
solicitude
for
him
the
only
thing
she
refrained
from
mentioning
was
the
walk
they
had
planned
which
she
had
to
omit
on
account
of
the
shirked
mass
she
had
saved
about
sixty
marks
which
she
carried
in
a
leather
pocket
next
to
her
body
the
silver
heart
would
cost
twelve
marks
at
the
very
most
plenty
of
money
remained
for
buying
a
gift
for
her
friend
she
wavered
long
between
a
college
portfolio
and
slippers
and
finally
decided
on
a
revolver
in
a
case
naturally
assuming
that
in
the
wild
struggle
for
existence
he
would
be
exposed
to
many
dangers
from
which
only
reckless
daring
and
instant
decision
could
rescue
him
a
revolver
and
case
cost
marks
gold
thread
for
embroidering
the
monogram
five
marks
thus
everything
was
arranged
in
the
best
possible
manner
when
she
saw
him
step
on
the
porch
the
morning
of
examination
day
white
as
the
glove
with
which
he
waved
farewell
to
his
parents
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
she
felt
as
if
she
should
have
to
run
after
him
and
press
the
weapon
of
deliverance
into
his
hand
without
further
delay
but
she
reflected
that
in
all
likelihood
the
examiners
would
not
show
themselves
susceptible
to
that
sort
of
eloquence
at
the
last
moment
as
he
stepped
from
the
porch
to
the
pavement
a
timid
glance
of
his
fell
upon
her
and
she
was
happy
at
one
there
was
some
stir
on
the
street
they
were
bringing
him
home
he
looked
weary
and
completely
crushed
but
the
others
whooped
and
huzzaed
the
old
sergeant
out
of
service
ran
to
meet
him
in
torn
slippers
and
violently
wiped
his
bristly
beard
on
his
son
face
from
the
kitchen
came
the
spicy
smell
of
cooking
sausages
lilly
ran
rejoicing
up
and
down
the
aisles
of
the
library
and
thought
with
a
sort
of
superior
satisfaction
joseph
fine
he
fine
the
very
next
morning
she
ordered
the
silver
heart
and
blushingly
asked
to
have
a
monogram
of
and
engraved
on
it
when
she
returned
she
found
an
envelope
addressed
to
her
among
the
order
slips
in
the
inside
was
a
soiled
menu
card
from
a
restaurant
on
which
was
written
sunday
on
the
porch
the
first
grey
of
dawn
entered
the
library
through
the
lunettes
in
the
shutters
lilly
sprang
out
of
bed
and
threw
the
windows
open
the
street
resembled
a
great
bowl
of
milk
so
heavily
the
white
mist
of
early
autumn
weighed
upon
the
ground
the
cold
damp
drizzle
did
her
hot
limbs
good
she
spread
her
arms
and
washed
herself
in
the
icy
air
as
in
a
bath
her
light
summer
dress
which
she
herself
had
washed
and
ironed
the
evening
before
hung
like
a
bluish
drift
on
the
white
wall
she
smartened
herself
as
never
before
this
festal
day
should
find
her
worthily
adorned
with
the
paltry
remnants
of
her
savings
she
had
bought
a
large
yellow
shepherdess
hat
tying
under
the
chin
so
doing
away
with
the
need
for
a
collar
and
openwork
silk
gloves
suddenly
came
to
light
having
been
discovered
at
the
bottom
of
the
trunk
where
they
had
long
lain
forgotten
she
would
carry
the
heavy
revolver
in
her
before
slipping
it
in
she
kissed
it
several
times
and
said
watch
over
him
faithfully
destroy
his
enemies
and
lead
him
on
to
victory
it
was
a
genuine
consecration
of
arms
at
five
sharp
the
door
opposite
creaked
on
its
hinges
she
glided
into
the
hall
on
the
porch
they
shook
hands
his
eyes
were
bleared
yet
he
looked
rather
enterprising
there
was
even
something
of
the
beau
in
his
he
wore
his
hat
tilted
a
bit
to
one
side
and
in
his
left
hand
swung
a
light
bamboo
cane
tipped
by
the
head
of
a
sea
gull
in
silver
lilly
stammered
congratulations
he
thanked
somewhat
condescendingly
as
if
so
insignificant
a
matter
were
not
worth
all
that
we
loaf
about
dreadfully
now
he
went
on
i
ca
say
i
get
a
great
deal
of
sport
out
of
it
but
a
fellow
has
to
know
something
of
the
follies
of
human
life
too
when
they
passed
anne
a
thought
suddenly
flashed
into
mind
which
filled
her
with
bliss
if
they
were
to
go
into
the
church
for
a
moment
the
sin
of
silence
would
be
removed
from
her
soul
and
joseph
could
even
bestow
his
blessing
on
the
day
timidly
she
gave
voice
to
her
wish
and
found
herself
in
a
pretty
mess
i
am
a
he
said
i
would
never
go
counter
to
my
convictions
nevertheless
it
is
an
enlightened
man
duty
to
be
tolerant
and
if
you
want
to
go
in
i
will
wait
outside
no
she
no
longer
wanted
to
and
she
was
terribly
ashamed
of
course
he
could
not
know
what
close
connection
existed
between
joseph
and
his
good
fortune
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
so
ungrateful
they
walked
in
silence
through
the
deserted
streets
of
the
suburbs
the
fog
lifted
a
little
lilly
chilled
through
and
through
shivered
at
each
step
perhaps
excitement
was
the
cause
on
the
whole
however
she
felt
much
calmer
than
she
had
expected
to
everything
was
so
altogether
altogether
different
a
little
disenchantment
had
occurred
she
did
not
know
how
she
cast
a
yearning
gaze
down
the
street
at
the
end
of
which
dark
trees
showed
their
heads
when
once
we
are
out
there
she
thought
and
clenched
her
teeth
to
keep
them
from
chattering
the
silence
began
to
paralyse
her
thoughts
she
would
gladly
have
started
a
conversation
had
she
been
able
to
think
of
a
suitable
beginning
a
baker
boy
was
walking
ahead
of
them
whistling
when
we
worked
all
night
said
fritz
redlich
suddenly
we
always
bought
warm
rolls
we
might
get
some
now
lilly
became
joyous
again
to
be
sure
had
he
said
we
might
steal
some
she
would
have
liked
it
better
the
baker
boy
was
not
permitted
to
sell
his
rolls
just
the
right
number
for
delivery
had
been
doled
out
to
him
but
on
the
opposite
side
was
an
open
shop
when
lilly
saw
her
hero
reappear
with
a
large
bag
in
his
hand
she
had
a
pleasant
sensation
as
if
they
were
beginning
housekeeping
together
they
now
walked
along
gardens
under
a
veritable
shower
of
dew
falling
from
the
trees
lilly
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
she
felt
so
cold
at
last
they
were
out
in
the
open
country
mats
of
cobwebs
each
weighted
down
with
a
burden
of
dew
were
spread
over
the
fields
of
high
stubble
yellow
ridges
of
hills
bounded
the
semicircle
of
the
landscape
and
in
the
distance
rose
the
walls
of
the
woods
lilly
stretched
her
arms
like
a
swimmer
and
drew
in
through
her
open
mouth
five
or
six
deep
breaths
are
you
feeling
well
lilly
laughed
i
must
make
up
for
all
i
lost
she
said
i
have
for
a
whole
year
feeling
frozen
still
she
began
to
run
he
tried
to
keep
pace
but
soon
fell
behind
and
panted
after
her
hopping
rather
than
running
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
first
hill
the
sun
began
to
rise
over
the
plain
the
brushwood
seemed
to
be
on
fire
and
the
cobwebs
shone
like
silver
each
became
a
glittering
spark
a
flame
ran
along
each
thread
lilly
warmed
and
excited
from
running
pressed
her
hands
to
her
heaving
breast
and
stared
into
the
sea
of
red
with
drunken
eyes
oh
look
look
she
stammered
giving
his
face
a
questioning
searching
glance
she
half
expected
him
to
recite
odes
sing
hymns
and
play
the
harp
he
stood
there
trying
to
get
his
breath
to
all
appearances
occupied
exclusively
with
himself
do
recite
something
redlich
she
begged
a
poem
by
klopstock
or
something
else
she
had
not
gotten
up
to
goethe
in
school
he
gave
a
short
laugh
and
replied
catch
me
now
that
examinations
are
over
german
literature
may
go
to
the
dogs
for
all
i
care
lilly
felt
ashamed
and
said
nothing
more
fearing
the
expression
of
such
crude
desires
must
make
her
culture
appear
half
baked
when
she
looked
up
again
the
glow
was
gone
the
fields
still
sent
up
vapours
to
meet
the
climbing
sun
whose
effulgence
hung
coldly
almost
indifferently
over
the
earth
begging
for
light
they
walked
on
toward
the
woods
he
swung
the
paper
bag
from
either
side
of
the
road
she
gathered
blackberries
which
depended
like
bunches
of
glistening
black
beads
from
bushes
overlaid
with
a
film
of
cobwebs
some
distance
on
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
they
came
upon
a
bench
without
discussing
it
they
simply
made
for
the
seat
it
was
the
place
they
needed
lilly
felt
a
little
oppression
at
her
heart
here
she
was
finally
to
receive
the
revelations
for
which
her
soul
languished
here
she
was
to
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
young
genius
he
opened
the
bag
and
she
laid
her
handkerchief
filled
with
the
blackberries
alongside
the
containing
the
heavy
revolver
was
deposited
for
the
time
being
between
the
rounds
of
the
bench
lilly
hollowed
out
the
rolls
and
filled
them
with
blackberries
and
the
two
breakfasted
together
very
cosily
the
golden
shimmer
of
early
autumn
poured
its
enchantment
over
them
lilly
brain
grew
heavy
with
longing
and
happiness
she
could
have
sunk
to
the
ground
and
laid
her
forehead
against
his
knees
merely
for
support
because
approaching
fulfillment
was
more
than
she
could
bear
he
had
removed
his
cap
a
curly
lock
fell
over
his
forehead
down
to
his
eyebrows
giving
his
face
a
sombre
expression
as
if
he
were
challenging
the
whole
world
this
genius
lock
was
the
fashion
among
the
boys
of
the
last
year
high
school
and
was
especially
cherished
by
those
who
did
not
aspire
to
the
stylishness
of
belonging
to
a
students
corps
his
gaze
rested
on
the
church
towers
of
the
old
city
which
resembled
awkward
faithful
sleepy
watchmen
looking
down
on
the
clusters
of
house
tops
will
you
tell
me
what
you
are
thinking
about
asked
lilly
bashfully
admiring
the
great
moment
at
last
it
had
come
he
gave
a
short
and
somewhat
mocking
laugh
i
am
calculating
how
many
ministers
get
their
living
in
a
nest
like
that
and
how
comfortable
it
is
for
a
fellow
if
he
just
studies
theology
why
do
you
learning
flows
in
on
one
from
all
sides
you
do
understand
he
reproved
her
gently
learning
is
not
the
chief
thing
conviction
is
one
must
do
everything
for
the
sake
of
conviction
suffer
want
suffer
all
sorts
of
privations
the
city
has
six
scholarships
to
bestow
upon
theological
students
but
i
would
rather
chop
my
hand
off
than
accept
one
a
man
must
take
up
the
fight
for
his
convictions
and
that
what
i
going
to
do
day
after
his
small
eyes
sparkled
he
stroked
the
genius
lock
from
his
forehead
with
a
trembling
hand
now
she
had
him
where
she
wanted
him
perhaps
this
was
the
very
instant
in
which
to
hand
him
the
revolver
but
out
of
respect
for
the
greatness
of
his
mood
she
deferred
the
matter
for
a
while
taking
a
firmer
hold
of
the
bag
in
which
the
revolver
was
lying
she
went
into
raptures
as
once
before
on
the
porch
oh
redlich
what
is
finer
than
such
a
fight
to
dive
into
the
waves
of
life
to
spite
the
dark
powers
who
control
our
destiny
and
wrest
our
fortune
from
them
to
come
out
of
the
struggle
each
time
with
greater
strength
a
more
iron
will
can
you
conceive
of
anything
more
but
this
time
too
her
adjuration
failed
to
awaken
an
echo
good
heavens
he
said
on
close
inspection
what
after
all
is
this
fight
everybody
walks
over
you
in
winter
you
lie
in
a
cold
bed
and
all
year
round
you
have
nothing
to
eat
of
course
going
to
go
into
it
of
course
i
am
but
it
hard
yes
indeed
hard
if
i
had
a
scholarship
i
should
feel
much
better
so
that
all
the
joy
you
have
in
facing
the
world
my
dear
young
lady
he
rejoined
a
fellow
who
starts
out
with
nothing
but
a
satchel
of
darned
wash
and
a
bill
where
he
to
get
much
joy
from
he
the
very
one
lilly
exclaimed
eager
to
cast
a
ray
of
her
own
confidence
into
his
heart
when
somebody
is
like
you
with
the
mark
of
greatness
on
his
face
then
the
world
lies
at
his
feet
she
described
a
semicircle
with
her
right
hand
taking
in
the
entire
plain
its
green
bushes
and
silvery
streams
and
the
city
with
its
wreath
of
swelling
gardens
lying
embedded
in
the
fields
like
a
lark
nest
in
a
meadow
lilly
felt
as
if
she
were
showing
him
a
small
copy
of
his
future
realm
he
nodded
several
times
in
the
dejected
consciousness
of
knowing
better
than
she
what
the
world
is
like
dear
me
it
hard
he
observed
very
very
hard
she
wanted
whether
or
no
to
convince
him
of
his
own
ability
to
conquer
and
growing
warmer
and
warmer
continued
with
her
peroration
if
only
i
could
express
what
i
know
and
feel
if
only
i
could
give
you
some
of
my
own
assurance
look
at
me
poor
thing
that
i
am
i
have
no
father
or
mother
and
no
friends
if
at
least
i
could
have
stayed
at
school
and
graduated
but
here
i
am
without
a
vocation
without
money
without
clothes
for
the
winter
not
even
a
decent
pair
of
shoes
she
stuck
out
the
worn
tips
of
her
old
boots
which
until
now
she
had
kept
carefully
hidden
i
do
get
as
much
to
eat
as
i
need
either
and
if
i
come
home
too
late
i
shall
be
whipped
yet
i
know
that
happiness
is
lying
in
wait
for
me
it
is
here
already
in
every
breeze
that
blows
my
way
in
every
sunbeam
that
smiles
at
me
the
whole
world
is
happiness
the
whole
world
is
music
everything
a
song
of
songs
everything
a
song
of
songs
she
turned
from
him
with
an
impetuous
movement
to
keep
him
from
seeing
how
she
was
quivering
all
over
down
in
the
city
the
chimes
began
to
ring
mary
once
the
cathedral
now
the
chief
protestant
church
came
first
with
its
three
resounding
clangs
george
uttered
a
clear
third
on
high
festivals
it
added
a
paternal
rumbling
more
bells
followed
anne
thin
tinkling
joined
in
modest
yet
to
be
distinguished
the
instant
it
began
there
was
a
secret
whispering
and
calling
in
it
we
know
each
other
we
love
each
other
and
joseph
says
morning
lilly
friend
seemed
to
have
used
the
period
of
her
silence
in
order
to
win
back
his
spiritual
balance
with
the
little
air
of
didactic
dignity
that
he
liked
to
assume
when
he
felt
he
had
the
advantage
in
a
situation
he
began
i
am
almost
inclined
to
think
we
do
quite
understand
each
other
i
was
at
great
pains
to
make
a
careful
study
of
the
problems
of
life
and
so
i
see
somewhat
deeper
into
things
than
you
i
up
to
snuff
about
the
illusions
of
youth
i
know
what
men
are
worth
and
i
should
advise
you
to
be
a
little
more
cautious
about
what
you
do
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
astounded
he
gave
her
a
sidewise
smile
with
an
air
of
mingled
superiority
and
uncertainty
well
beauty
carries
certain
dangers
in
its
train
nonsense
beauty
lilly
cried
glowing
all
over
who
thinks
of
such
silliness
the
person
upon
whom
nature
has
bestowed
such
a
gift
he
went
on
has
many
reasons
for
being
on
her
guard
for
instance
it
a
piece
of
good
luck
for
you
that
you
chanced
upon
so
strict
and
correct
a
young
man
as
i
am
another
man
with
a
more
frivolous
nature
than
mine
would
have
made
an
entirely
different
use
of
an
excursion
like
this
you
may
be
sure
of
that
lilly
stared
at
him
she
was
carried
away
by
a
whirl
of
obscure
and
disagreeable
thoughts
what
did
he
want
of
her
was
he
reproaching
her
did
he
scorn
her
because
of
her
most
sacred
feelings
oh
dear
she
said
utterly
discomposed
i
wish
we
were
at
home
understand
me
he
began
again
i
am
by
no
means
a
pharisee
i
have
a
thorough
comprehension
of
the
weaknesses
of
human
nature
i
am
only
offering
you
a
bit
of
advice
in
all
modesty
and
some
day
you
will
thank
me
for
it
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
a
fellow
has
his
principles
should
we
ever
meet
again
later
in
life
you
will
i
hope
not
have
to
be
ashamed
of
the
friend
of
your
youth
if
it
a
question
of
shame
something
within
lilly
cried
then
i
ought
to
feel
ashamed
now
and
of
myself
forward
undignified
that
was
what
she
held
herself
to
be
for
having
begged
him
to
take
this
morning
walk
yet
there
had
been
nothing
evil
in
the
thing
where
had
the
evil
suddenly
come
from
the
chimes
were
still
making
music
the
sun
was
still
weaving
its
net
of
gold
about
her
she
saw
nothing
she
heard
nothing
so
very
ashamed
she
was
she
wanted
to
run
away
but
did
not
dare
even
to
stir
as
for
him
he
no
longer
looked
as
if
he
needed
comforting
his
manner
expressed
the
quiet
satisfaction
a
man
feels
with
a
piece
of
work
just
completed
a
blackberry
had
remained
sticking
in
a
crevice
in
the
seat
of
the
bench
one
must
get
spots
on
one
clothes
he
admonished
and
stuck
the
berry
in
his
mouth
slowly
crunching
the
seeds
between
his
teeth
lilly
pulled
herself
together
and
caught
up
her
what
are
you
carrying
there
he
asked
it
looks
so
heavy
lilly
in
terror
clutched
the
bag
tight
only
the
house
key
she
stammered
then
they
went
home
if
only
i
could
change
his
mind
she
thought
so
that
he
would
have
a
favorable
opinion
of
me
again
nothing
better
occurred
to
her
than
to
stoop
at
the
wayside
and
pluck
the
finest
field
flowers
she
could
reach
to
offer
to
him
as
a
farewell
gift
instead
of
that
other
gift
the
mere
thought
of
which
made
her
feel
like
a
goose
she
handed
him
the
bouquet
keeping
her
eyes
turned
aside
he
thanked
her
with
a
pretty
bow
and
twirled
the
bamboo
cane
with
the
silver
handle
an
heirloom
of
which
he
had
just
come
into
possession
he
swung
it
boldly
about
his
head
the
way
future
corps
students
do
before
making
a
high
carte
lilly
in
her
dejection
and
humiliation
was
unable
to
say
a
word
does
an
inner
voice
he
asked
tell
you
we
shall
meet
some
time
again
she
turned
her
face
away
she
had
all
to
do
to
force
back
the
tears
welling
up
in
her
eyes
then
i
hope
you
will
receive
proof
of
what
unremitting
effort
and
unshakable
fidelity
to
one
convictions
can
accomplish
even
with
small
means
his
voice
now
sounded
full
and
vibrant
with
energy
while
making
her
small
and
timorous
he
seemed
to
have
sucked
up
some
of
her
joyous
mood
when
they
drew
near
the
altmarkt
however
he
became
greatly
disquieted
again
and
kept
spying
about
on
all
sides
finally
he
remarked
that
the
streets
were
getting
pretty
lively
and
it
would
be
better
perhaps
if
they
were
to
part
company
and
go
back
by
different
ways
a
few
days
later
he
left
home
and
the
house
was
perfumed
with
the
garlic
of
the
sausage
that
redlich
sliced
into
his
soup
as
a
farewell
offering
lilly
stood
behind
the
window
curtain
with
burning
eyes
and
thought
in
her
sorrow
oh
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
him
chapter
ix
one
grey
october
morning
which
hid
the
threat
of
approaching
winter
behind
a
mask
of
moist
warm
mist
as
behind
a
hypocritical
smile
the
wonderful
happened
asmussen
runaway
daughters
came
back
again
without
casting
a
shadow
before
them
there
they
were
all
of
a
sudden
shoving
several
bulging
into
the
library
measuring
lilly
with
an
astonished
look
of
gracious
frigidity
and
ordering
her
to
pay
for
the
cab
they
had
no
change
lilly
felt
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
up
to
her
neck
the
moment
the
two
grand
voluptuous
figures
appeared
on
the
scene
and
though
looking
a
bit
weather
beaten
and
washed
out
swept
victoriously
into
possession
of
the
territory
she
knew
they
were
asmussen
daughters
she
cast
one
anxious
look
at
the
pretty
faces
where
two
pairs
of
bright
grey
eyes
challenged
the
door
of
the
rear
room
and
another
anxious
look
at
the
broom
of
welcome
whose
hour
had
come
then
she
hurried
off
to
avoid
the
terrors
bound
to
follow
upon
the
opening
of
the
middle
door
in
the
cab
she
found
two
withered
bouquets
of
gladioli
a
scotch
plaid
rolled
in
a
shawl
strap
from
which
two
umbrella
handles
large
blue
glass
knobs
the
size
of
a
man
fist
were
sticking
out
some
cushions
trimmed
with
diagonal
bars
and
a
whisky
flask
there
was
also
a
tin
box
of
lemon
drops
sans
lid
and
a
disjointed
paper
between
whose
cracks
a
comb
and
a
piece
of
buttered
bread
were
striving
in
unison
to
find
their
way
into
freedom
lilly
gathered
up
the
effects
and
stopped
in
the
hall
listening
in
terror
she
expected
to
hear
the
screams
of
the
maltreated
girls
but
all
was
serene
and
when
she
entered
she
saw
mother
and
daughters
hugging
and
kissing
since
there
was
no
time
left
before
the
midday
meal
to
buy
a
roast
in
honor
of
the
festive
occasion
dinner
consisted
of
cabbage
as
usual
with
the
addition
of
a
mountain
of
cakes
from
the
confectioner
to
which
the
girls
helped
themselves
before
the
meal
in
order
to
lay
some
aside
for
days
of
less
plenty
this
was
the
first
evidence
of
their
housekeeperly
thrift
asmussen
beamed
with
motherly
joy
and
tenderness
well
she
said
did
i
exaggerate
when
i
told
you
about
these
glorious
creatures
too
bad
i
had
to
do
without
them
for
so
long
but
i
am
modest
in
my
demands
and
i
am
glad
enough
to
get
what
i
do
i
know
their
hearts
draw
them
now
to
their
father
now
to
their
mother
because
they
can
not
make
up
their
minds
to
deprive
either
of
us
permanently
of
the
gift
of
their
pure
filial
love
she
was
sitting
between
the
girls
and
she
pressed
a
hand
of
each
all
three
looked
into
one
another
eyes
devotedly
the
absent
pater
familias
was
remembered
touchingly
their
gay
talented
father
the
girls
said
intended
to
give
up
his
large
business
to
assume
the
management
of
extensive
farms
in
the
south
of
russia
at
the
urgent
invitation
of
influential
patrons
later
in
asmussen
gloomier
hours
it
transpired
that
that
scoundrel
had
had
to
scurry
off
because
of
some
questionable
notes
and
hide
in
odessa
until
the
atmosphere
in
the
north
cleared
to
lilly
unpracticed
eye
the
girls
were
as
like
as
two
sparrows
saucy
greedy
inconstant
and
amorous
it
was
only
after
a
time
that
she
learned
to
distinguish
between
them
lona
the
older
who
possessed
some
beauty
of
a
coarse
kind
had
the
ways
of
a
clutching
grasping
barmaid
and
was
the
sharper
of
the
two
usually
dragging
her
sister
mi
in
tow
whose
chief
characteristic
was
a
sort
of
flabby
drollness
in
their
treatment
of
lilly
they
observed
for
the
time
being
the
pacific
attitude
of
suspicion
willing
to
bide
its
time
hints
were
not
omitted
to
inform
a
certain
person
that
they
would
soon
learn
what
position
to
take
and
whether
there
was
to
be
peace
or
war
when
they
were
finally
convinced
that
lilly
was
shy
and
harmless
the
waves
of
their
tender
confidences
met
over
her
head
it
now
became
the
regular
thing
for
all
three
of
them
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
until
late
at
night
with
their
corsets
open
and
their
knees
drawn
up
to
their
chins
talking
talking
talking
while
they
sucked
candies
bought
on
the
sly
or
dressed
one
another
hair
beautiful
souls
poured
forth
confessions
whispered
confidences
about
love
adventures
and
flowed
on
steadily
flooding
lilly
pure
fancy
with
a
turbid
stream
of
sexual
mysteries
what
the
asmussen
girls
liked
above
all
was
to
have
their
bodies
admired
when
i
turn
this
way
is
the
set
of
my
shoulders
classic
have
i
a
marble
bosom
if
i
were
so
bashful
i
take
off
my
shirt
and
show
you
my
hips
they
are
like
a
goddess
they
made
less
frequent
appeals
for
criticism
of
their
features
we
gotten
so
many
compliments
about
our
good
looks
that
we
have
any
doubts
on
that
score
nevertheless
when
cold
weather
set
in
and
necessitated
the
wearing
of
woolen
scarfs
over
their
heads
they
did
not
scorn
to
discuss
the
truly
greek
way
their
hair
had
of
growing
low
on
their
foreheads
or
the
seductive
curves
of
their
mouths
they
could
also
be
severely
our
eyes
are
not
beautiful
we
know
yours
for
instance
are
much
lovelier
but
whether
cast
sheep
eyes
at
anybody
or
not
all
the
same
now
if
just
chuck
a
little
sidelong
glance
think
no
one
could
possibly
notice
it
why
in
a
jiffy
they
after
us
like
mad
their
iridescent
cattish
eyes
would
twinkle
with
the
pleasant
sense
of
unbounded
power
and
triumph
over
the
weakness
of
that
strong
animal
man
the
advice
they
dispensed
liberally
to
lilly
might
be
summed
up
in
one
sentence
do
what
you
please
but
do
surrender
yourself
they
laid
no
restraint
upon
themselves
in
retailing
spicy
stories
which
set
lilly
pulse
to
bounding
and
in
which
they
proved
their
absolute
seriousness
in
the
observance
of
this
motto
they
manifested
a
strong
sensual
craving
one
of
them
once
remarked
my
highest
ideal
is
to
be
queen
of
the
bees
but
to
have
no
children
the
other
who
seemed
inclined
to
ethical
speculations
rejoined
vivaciously
my
highest
ideal
is
to
be
a
nun
and
horribly
immoral
she
pursued
the
theme
entering
into
all
details
after
the
manner
of
the
renaissance
narrators
while
lilly
pious
soul
trembled
and
shuddered
their
libertinism
of
thought
notwithstanding
all
their
hopes
and
dreams
centered
about
marriage
to
marry
as
quickly
as
possible
and
as
advantageously
as
possible
was
salvation
career
a
specific
for
all
ills
earthly
bliss
and
eternal
happiness
that
is
he
must
be
he
must
be
and
he
must
be
this
trinity
embodied
all
their
demands
of
fate
as
others
invest
their
with
supernatural
virtues
these
girls
revelled
in
picturing
their
future
spouses
infirmities
and
in
recounting
the
tricks
they
meant
to
play
upon
them
by
virtue
of
their
bodily
and
spiritual
superiority
they
were
not
always
agreed
as
to
the
ways
and
means
of
obtaining
this
precious
possession
so
absolutely
indispensable
to
life
a
favorite
subject
of
debate
between
them
was
is
it
expedient
or
is
it
not
expedient
to
compromise
oneself
with
the
man
of
one
choice
lona
whose
daring
in
hatching
difficult
schemes
of
action
knew
no
bounds
upheld
the
positive
side
mi
who
wished
to
be
sure
where
she
trod
inclined
to
the
negative
if
you
knew
those
male
milksops
half
as
well
as
i
do
lona
scolded
you
realize
that
the
best
way
to
catch
them
is
through
fear
make
them
sin
and
twist
their
sin
about
their
necks
like
a
halter
the
only
way
to
be
sure
of
them
it
very
odd
mi
returned
with
inexorable
logic
that
you
practised
what
you
preach
because
if
you
had
you
long
ago
discretion
bade
her
break
off
her
sister
fingers
crooked
ready
to
scratch
boded
no
good
only
a
week
after
their
arrival
a
love
tilt
took
place
between
them
in
which
hair
puffs
and
petticoat
strings
flew
about
and
from
which
mi
emerged
with
a
laceration
which
lilly
had
to
treat
with
vinegar
compresses
the
rest
of
the
night
the
cause
of
their
contention
was
a
swell
who
had
followed
them
on
their
afternoon
walk
and
who
according
to
mi
had
been
discouraged
from
coming
closer
because
her
sister
had
not
responded
sufficiently
to
his
advances
lona
asserted
the
principle
that
one
must
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
swells
while
mi
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
would
have
been
good
enough
for
a
husband
at
any
rate
strolling
through
the
streets
and
permitting
themselves
to
be
accosted
soon
became
their
chief
and
daily
occupation
lilly
who
had
credited
and
been
greatly
disturbed
by
the
threats
they
first
made
that
they
would
assume
the
management
of
the
business
soon
realized
she
had
nothing
to
apprehend
in
this
regard
they
slept
until
nine
and
took
two
hours
for
dressing
then
they
went
out
for
their
morning
walk
to
make
the
necessary
estimates
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
garrison
who
at
that
hour
of
the
day
promenaded
in
groups
near
the
main
guard
if
the
first
half
of
the
day
was
dedicated
to
the
military
the
second
half
was
devoted
chiefly
to
ordinary
citizens
it
goes
without
saying
that
afternoon
coffee
was
taken
nowhere
else
than
at
frangipani
confectionery
shop
where
a
few
lieutenants
and
a
number
of
city
officials
and
young
lawyers
gathered
to
play
chess
or
skat
and
where
too
many
a
more
dashing
high
school
teacher
came
to
display
his
kinship
with
the
proper
world
of
fashion
after
this
hour
spiced
by
all
sorts
of
sweets
followed
the
promenade
at
twilight
which
proved
highly
advantageous
for
establishing
possible
connections
and
provided
the
subjects
needed
for
discussion
at
home
it
would
not
be
stating
the
full
truth
to
say
that
asmussen
brought
a
loving
sympathy
to
bear
in
her
judgment
of
this
kind
of
life
certainly
not
the
mutual
adulation
of
the
first
few
days
had
given
place
to
a
period
of
sultriness
when
cutting
remarks
flashed
in
the
murky
atmosphere
like
streaks
of
lightning
then
a
season
of
protracted
storm
set
in
and
mishaps
occurred
in
swift
succession
gradually
becoming
so
purely
a
matter
of
course
that
even
lilly
who
at
first
had
wept
and
screamed
along
with
the
other
three
began
to
consider
this
the
normal
condition
of
the
asmussen
household
abusive
epithets
of
unsuspected
vigor
flew
hither
and
thither
and
the
place
resounded
with
cuffings
even
the
broom
which
in
the
beginning
had
not
been
given
a
thought
was
now
drawn
into
its
strictly
limited
field
of
activity
peace
did
not
come
until
evening
when
asmussen
medicine
asserted
its
rights
the
two
girls
might
have
taken
advantage
of
her
oblivion
to
give
free
play
to
their
desires
had
not
their
highly
developed
sense
of
propriety
strictly
forbidden
going
out
at
night
persons
meeting
us
would
take
us
for
fast
girls
they
said
and
then
no
wedding
bells
for
us
one
would
scarcely
believe
with
what
a
number
of
conventions
the
young
ladies
circumscribed
their
apparently
unrestrained
existence
you
may
let
yourself
be
kissed
as
much
as
you
like
but
on
no
account
kiss
back
you
may
let
a
gentleman
call
you
by
your
first
name
in
conversation
but
if
he
does
so
in
a
letter
it
is
an
insult
you
may
let
a
gentleman
treat
you
to
coffee
and
cake
but
not
to
bread
and
butter
you
may
let
a
strange
man
tread
on
your
foot
but
if
he
attempts
to
press
your
hand
under
the
table
you
must
get
up
and
so
on
lilly
had
absolutely
no
comprehension
for
this
set
of
thoughts
and
desires
hitherto
man
as
a
male
had
been
a
piece
of
life
in
bodily
form
which
came
to
her
notice
on
occasions
but
glided
by
like
a
stranger
without
holding
her
attention
she
had
solely
loved
the
man
of
her
dreams
the
man
of
her
novels
the
man
of
her
own
creation
the
thing
that
stared
at
her
on
the
street
the
thing
that
came
to
exchange
books
and
found
all
sorts
of
little
pretexts
for
entering
into
conversation
with
her
the
thing
that
officiously
held
aside
the
wadded
curtain
of
the
church
door
as
she
entered
or
played
the
amiable
over
a
shop
counter
this
thing
was
a
strange
annoying
fact
it
was
stupid
and
brazen
a
matter
of
unspeakable
indifference
to
think
of
which
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
a
degradation
a
girl
entire
life
she
now
learned
was
here
simply
for
the
sake
of
that
gross
and
disgusting
race
and
a
girl
could
concern
herself
about
them
from
the
moment
she
rose
to
the
moment
she
fell
asleep
without
cherishing
the
thought
of
the
one
for
whom
she
had
been
created
as
for
work
and
faith
and
god
though
lilly
knew
she
was
infinitely
above
being
influenced
by
the
two
girls
advice
and
example
she
felt
in
spite
of
herself
a
small
desire
arising
within
her
to
find
out
what
the
nature
of
those
creatures
might
be
about
whom
such
a
fuss
was
made
whose
approval
brought
pleasure
whose
coldness
meant
annihilation
she
was
beset
by
a
tormenting
fear
of
that
dreadful
seething
world
outside
there
of
the
dirt
that
was
carried
to
her
door
every
day
anew
and
of
the
disquieting
curiosity
with
which
she
picked
it
up
to
examine
it
for
whether
or
no
her
thoughts
return
to
the
gay
pictures
painted
in
colors
of
poison
which
the
two
sisters
growing
ever
more
demoralized
unrolled
before
her
eyes
evening
after
evening
it
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
the
hot
friendship
both
at
first
bestowed
upon
her
cooled
off
somewhat
after
a
month
or
so
the
cause
was
the
enigmatic
shortage
in
the
cash
box
which
occurred
time
and
again
and
came
to
be
a
permanent
phenomenon
lilly
would
spend
hours
calculating
feverishly
entering
and
counting
every
cent
until
finally
there
was
no
other
conclusion
to
be
reached
than
that
some
one
had
used
the
few
moments
of
her
absence
to
dip
into
the
drawer
where
the
box
was
kept
in
order
to
save
herself
in
case
of
discovery
she
would
be
accused
of
the
theft
she
once
carried
the
key
of
the
drawer
away
with
her
as
if
unintentionally
and
did
so
repeatedly
until
the
girls
manner
which
had
grown
increasingly
estranged
and
scornful
assured
her
that
she
was
on
the
right
tack
on
one
occasion
they
gave
vent
to
their
wrath
and
disillusionment
did
stray
dog
that
she
was
think
she
was
mistress
of
the
place
if
need
be
books
and
keys
would
be
taken
from
her
by
force
in
mortal
fright
lilly
ran
to
the
mother
and
threatened
to
leave
that
instant
unless
she
was
allowed
to
control
affairs
as
before
asmussen
who
knew
her
scapegrace
offspring
through
and
through
took
sides
with
lilly
and
the
storm
seemed
to
have
blown
over
the
girls
took
to
entreaty
and
in
reawakened
intimacy
gave
lilly
new
and
comprehensive
views
into
the
depths
of
their
soul
life
did
she
think
they
cared
a
row
of
pins
for
the
miserable
little
meringues
they
ate
at
frangipani
not
a
bit
of
it
they
were
clever
enough
to
know
how
to
provide
for
the
future
at
any
rate
they
stay
with
that
old
guzzler
forever
especially
since
the
place
had
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
unproductive
in
regard
to
good
matches
so
for
a
long
time
they
had
been
saving
money
industriously
for
another
flight
it
was
no
exaggeration
to
say
they
were
starving
themselves
miserably
lilly
with
her
paltry
desires
could
have
no
idea
how
many
temptations
they
withstood
when
they
sat
at
a
table
in
the
confectionery
shop
at
suppertime
and
had
to
look
upon
all
sorts
of
glorious
goodies
without
tasting
them
lilly
remained
unmoved
by
their
persuasive
wiles
their
manner
cooled
off
again
and
they
began
to
pass
her
by
tacitly
showing
their
sense
of
injury
soon
events
occurred
that
fanned
their
enmity
into
a
lively
fire
chapter
x
it
was
dusk
of
a
wet
november
day
the
spouts
were
streaming
and
an
endless
chain
of
grey
drops
glided
down
the
iron
rods
of
the
porch
railing
and
fell
precipitously
into
the
pool
gleaming
on
the
pavement
below
a
miserable
sort
of
sport
to
watch
the
game
but
what
better
diversion
had
the
day
to
offer
suddenly
the
front
door
opened
the
library
bell
rang
sharply
and
in
came
a
nimble
little
fellow
capering
and
stamping
and
exhaling
an
aroma
of
russia
leather
and
parma
violets
his
coat
collar
was
turned
up
and
his
hat
pulled
far
down
his
blond
hair
shone
like
velvet
he
measured
lilly
from
between
lids
masterfully
narrowed
to
a
slit
with
a
cursory
and
apparently
disillusioned
glance
threw
out
a
strident
good
evening
and
examined
the
back
part
of
the
room
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
emerge
from
behind
the
bookcases
and
give
him
a
special
greeting
lilly
asked
what
she
could
do
for
him
oh
you
are
the
young
lady
in
charge
of
the
circulating
library
he
asked
the
existence
of
such
a
young
lady
seemed
to
transport
him
into
a
kind
of
careless
gaiety
lilly
said
she
was
splendid
he
replied
just
splendid
and
a
thousand
little
merry
devils
danced
in
his
blinking
eyes
lilly
asked
what
book
he
wished
be
it
known
to
you
most
honored
and
erudite
miss
i
am
not
exactly
familiar
with
german
literature
and
the
allied
sciences
but
ever
since
yesterday
i
have
been
possessed
of
a
fabulous
and
downright
sophomoric
zeal
for
culture
if
you
would
help
me
with
your
valuable
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
stuck
a
monocle
in
his
eye
looked
her
up
and
down
first
on
the
right
side
then
on
the
left
the
way
an
intending
purchaser
scrutinises
a
horse
murmured
something
like
the
devil
and
asked
to
have
the
light
turned
on
immediately
since
it
had
actually
grown
so
dark
that
the
numbers
on
the
backs
of
the
books
were
illegible
lilly
saw
no
reason
for
refusing
his
request
when
she
reached
up
in
all
her
glory
to
raise
the
chimney
from
the
hanging
lamp
he
uttered
a
second
and
more
audible
the
devil
and
when
she
stood
there
before
him
the
light
shining
on
her
sidewise
with
an
uneasy
questioning
look
in
her
improbable
eyes
those
lilly
eyes
he
sank
back
on
the
customers
seat
to
show
how
utterly
nonplussed
he
was
and
folded
his
hands
and
implored
her
forgiveness
lilly
felt
a
hot
sense
of
insult
rising
in
her
so
low
was
she
esteemed
in
her
position
that
an
aristocratic
young
man
the
first
who
had
strayed
in
to
her
in
the
course
of
one
and
a
half
years
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
show
her
the
most
ordinary
courtesy
if
you
do
not
wish
to
borrow
a
book
sir
she
said
giving
him
a
superior
look
please
leave
the
place
what
what
did
you
say
he
rejoined
outraged
i
borrow
a
book
book
one
beggarly
book
for
every
five
minutes
i
am
permitted
to
stay
here
i
will
take
out
a
whole
shelf
of
books
for
all
i
care
a
whole
case
of
books
but
with
the
proviso
that
i
may
return
them
i
will
immediately
contract
with
the
best
express
company
in
town
to
keep
hauling
the
cases
away
and
back
again
but
one
moment
one
moment
it
seems
to
me
i
once
heard
that
for
every
book
taken
from
a
circulating
library
you
have
to
leave
three
marks
deposit
is
that
so
lilly
stared
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
and
said
it
was
so
well
since
i
have
such
an
amount
of
money
in
my
possession
just
now
i
must
ask
you
to
keep
here
as
a
deposit
so
in
a
measure
i
yield
myself
up
to
you
for
imprisonment
very
vexatious
for
both
parties
i
sure
but
what
else
is
to
be
done
in
the
circumstances
in
spite
of
herself
lilly
had
to
laugh
oh
she
reconciled
he
cried
triumphantly
her
majesty
is
reconciled
and
now
let
us
speak
to
each
other
as
decorous
friends
observe
me
well
do
i
look
as
if
i
read
books
to
be
sure
i
have
my
favourites
schlicht
and
winterfeld
and
others
who
purport
to
know
the
humour
of
soldiering
life
but
if
i
come
here
it
not
to
get
books
the
thing
goes
deeper
than
that
i
hope
i
may
confide
in
you
if
you
think
it
necessary
stammered
lilly
whose
eyes
were
fascinated
by
a
gleaming
chain
peeping
from
under
the
sleeve
of
his
tan
overcoat
she
did
not
know
men
ever
wore
gold
bracelets
evenings
i
like
to
get
into
mufti
the
rest
of
the
time
you
know
i
wear
uniform
but
not
for
long
any
more
in
a
few
weeks
i
depart
this
life
because
do
you
know
what
debts
are
no
then
rejoice
debts
are
the
sour
sediment
in
the
lemonade
of
human
existence
and
the
lemonade
at
that
is
none
too
sweet
but
what
was
i
going
to
say
oh
yes
evenings
i
like
to
play
and
strive
to
win
the
favor
of
the
populace
by
honouring
the
populace
more
commendable
daughters
with
a
little
conversation
understand
so
in
remoter
districts
where
high
are
the
hedges
and
silent
the
new
villas
so
yesterday
i
behind
two
young
ladies
laughing
over
their
shoulders
and
swinging
their
skirts
exactly
the
way
girls
are
wont
to
do
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
should
like
this
talk
to
end
said
lilly
red
with
shame
not
at
all
he
said
i
knew
at
once
you
are
a
perfect
lady
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
ticklish
matters
i
am
merely
confessing
in
order
to
secure
a
little
absolution
from
your
purity
this
turn
did
lilly
soul
good
and
she
did
not
oppose
him
further
so
the
two
young
ladies
were
walking
in
front
of
me
arm
in
arm
the
moment
i
i
slipped
in
between
like
a
slice
of
sausage
in
a
sandwich
they
were
a
bit
offish
they
told
me
they
owned
a
large
circulating
library
and
intended
shortly
to
open
an
art
shop
in
berlin
and
so
on
but
they
did
mention
their
address
and
since
i
admit
it
with
shame
until
a
few
moments
ago
i
thought
they
had
some
good
points
i
am
simply
making
the
rounds
of
all
the
libraries
in
the
directory
besides
the
bookstores
there
are
only
three
i
investigated
the
other
two
and
now
that
i
know
the
third
the
art
shop
proprietresses
may
go
to
the
devil
for
all
i
care
a
feeling
of
scorn
and
mischievous
delight
arose
in
lilly
she
gave
a
short
laugh
but
took
good
care
not
to
disclose
the
existence
of
the
asmussen
girls
to
prove
to
her
that
in
the
presence
of
her
majesty
all
desire
for
an
adventure
ended
he
presented
himself
formally
von
prell
future
observing
her
questioning
look
he
continued
as
i
delicately
indicated
my
days
in
the
regiment
are
numbered
lilly
timidly
inquired
whether
an
officer
life
no
longer
pleased
him
until
now
i
knew
of
no
sort
of
life
that
would
have
pleased
me
wanton
spirits
shot
little
gleams
from
his
small
grey
eyes
but
the
paternal
riches
have
taken
wing
and
my
wages
as
army
serf
will
just
about
buy
radishes
and
even
radishes
get
expensive
around
christmas
time
so
the
best
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
buy
an
old
herring
keg
and
let
myself
be
salted
and
packed
if
you
should
happen
to
know
of
one
to
be
had
cheap
i
give
the
best
prices
lilly
frankly
laughed
a
joyous
laugh
he
joined
in
holding
his
hands
to
his
hips
and
emitting
a
thin
falsetto
tehee
which
though
scarcely
audible
shook
his
slim
sinewy
body
as
with
a
storm
of
merriment
they
now
sat
opposite
each
other
like
two
good
friends
with
the
counter
between
lilly
wished
the
hour
would
never
end
a
maid
entered
to
exchange
a
volume
of
for
her
mistress
he
unassumingly
disposed
himself
for
a
stay
examined
the
backs
of
several
books
and
acted
altogether
as
if
he
were
at
home
when
the
maid
left
he
pulled
the
door
open
obsequiously
and
bowed
and
scraped
as
she
passed
through
lilly
grew
more
and
more
hilarious
and
restrained
her
laughter
with
difficulty
before
the
next
customer
comes
you
must
go
she
said
else
begin
to
think
something
why
he
asked
the
customers
change
but
lilly
insisted
whereupon
he
took
to
pleading
listen
he
said
i
am
known
as
a
man
utterly
devoid
of
moral
fibre
do
be
my
stay
in
this
mundane
existence
at
least
until
the
door
opens
again
while
i
sitting
here
i
can
commit
no
follies
and
that
must
convey
some
consolation
to
your
charitable
heart
it
was
agreed
therefore
that
he
might
keep
his
place
until
the
next
time
the
bell
rang
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
comfortably
and
scanned
lilly
with
the
tender
emotions
of
unlimited
ownership
all
earthly
ills
flow
from
garrulousness
he
began
if
columbus
had
just
kept
the
discovery
of
america
to
himself
nobody
would
have
made
it
disagreeable
for
him
i
will
be
wilier
i
will
consider
my
discovery
as
a
family
secret
between
you
and
me
what
a
feast
for
the
fellows
let
them
keep
to
the
moths
that
fly
at
twilight
like
the
two
prospective
proprietresses
to
whom
i
owe
the
good
fortune
of
your
acquaintance
lilly
had
completely
forgotten
the
sisters
it
was
about
time
for
them
to
be
coming
home
suppose
they
were
suddenly
to
open
the
door
the
bell
rang
no
it
was
they
it
was
a
spinster
who
daily
devoured
several
volumes
of
love
affairs
and
came
every
evening
for
fresh
fodder
the
blithe
lieutenant
remembering
the
compact
shot
up
out
of
his
chair
his
demeanour
stiffened
into
coolness
if
you
please
he
twanged
will
you
kindly
let
me
have
the
latest
work
by
by
evidently
no
german
author
occurred
to
him
after
racking
his
brain
the
delivering
name
came
by
gerstäcker
lilly
brought
him
the
latest
work
which
bore
the
date
he
deposited
the
requisite
three
marks
and
took
leave
with
too
sweeping
a
bow
while
the
little
imps
frolicked
between
his
lids
soon
after
the
sisters
came
home
cast
a
suspicious
look
at
flaming
cheeks
and
passed
by
without
greeting
her
the
next
day
went
after
the
fashion
of
every
other
but
something
troubled
lilly
something
like
christmas
expectations
a
premonitory
restlessness
which
pressed
on
to
a
new
life
and
behold
at
the
same
time
as
the
day
before
the
door
opened
and
in
stepped
two
elegant
young
men
who
emitted
a
strident
good
evening
their
manner
was
both
a
bit
assured
and
a
bit
abashed
as
they
asked
for
an
interesting
book
while
measuring
lilly
with
the
stare
of
a
connoisseur
she
felt
her
limbs
grow
heavy
and
rigid
as
always
when
conscious
of
being
observed
and
admired
but
she
maintained
her
dignity
and
when
the
young
gentlemen
after
selecting
their
trash
which
they
scarcely
glanced
at
wanted
to
start
up
a
bantering
conversation
she
tossed
her
head
and
withdrew
behind
the
bookcase
l
to
n
which
sheltered
her
when
she
sat
at
the
making
her
entries
and
calculations
the
gentlemen
took
whispered
counsel
with
each
other
said
a
low
and
beat
a
retreat
so
her
jolly
friend
had
betrayed
her
after
all
from
now
on
asmussen
poor
little
hole
of
a
library
swarmed
with
slim
young
men
of
fashion
who
were
driven
by
an
insatiable
desire
for
reading
to
exchange
one
musty
old
volume
for
another
only
a
few
dared
come
in
uniform
but
they
did
not
withhold
their
names
and
the
last
page
of
the
customers
book
looked
as
if
extracted
from
an
almanac
de
gotha
some
wrapped
themselves
in
a
coat
of
correctness
others
came
with
careless
assurance
of
victory
one
man
began
to
make
love
on
the
spot
and
another
even
had
the
audacity
to
bandy
gross
language
over
the
counter
the
naïvest
one
condescendingly
inquired
when
within
the
next
few
days
he
might
expect
a
visit
from
her
lilly
soon
came
to
see
that
these
attentions
neither
honoured
nor
gave
hurt
she
chatted
freely
with
those
who
were
courteous
refrained
from
replying
to
those
who
were
impertinent
and
the
instant
a
conversation
threatened
to
become
lengthy
she
disappeared
behind
case
l
to
within
a
few
days
the
sisters
had
discovered
the
aristocratic
visitors
their
rage
knew
no
bounds
decency
was
thrown
to
the
winds
lilly
was
not
spared
a
single
insult
a
single
abuse
vile
epithets
such
as
she
had
never
heard
poured
over
her
in
a
dirty
stream
the
girls
demanded
that
she
cede
her
place
at
the
counter
to
them
she
refused
point
blank
whereupon
they
took
to
maltreating
her
on
occasions
of
greatest
need
asmussen
came
to
her
assistance
the
broom
rained
blows
on
the
white
nightgowns
of
the
jealous
furies
and
drove
them
into
the
back
room
where
the
battle
was
drowned
in
rivers
of
tears
hostilities
continued
in
case
business
exigencies
necessitated
some
during
the
day
while
customers
were
present
feelings
were
given
all
the
freer
play
in
the
morning
and
evening
lilly
life
became
a
veritable
hell
a
crust
of
hate
and
bitterness
laid
itself
over
her
soul
partly
in
fright
partly
in
satisfaction
she
felt
herself
growing
harder
and
sharper
it
was
only
at
night
that
she
melted
when
she
buried
her
burning
head
in
the
pillows
and
gave
vent
to
her
misery
in
silent
weeping
the
merry
friend
with
the
white
lashes
who
had
caused
the
entire
catastrophe
did
not
put
in
appearance
for
about
two
weeks
he
came
in
dragging
his
legs
a
little
and
his
eyes
were
swollen
and
bleared
this
flower
he
said
undoing
the
tissue
paper
of
the
package
in
his
hand
is
the
picotee
which
keeps
fresh
five
or
six
days
longer
than
any
parting
pangs
at
the
sight
of
him
lilly
felt
a
little
comforting
joy
light
up
within
her
she
took
the
bouquet
as
a
matter
of
course
and
reproached
him
for
not
having
kept
his
mouth
shut
i
told
you
he
replied
imperturbably
that
i
am
a
man
utterly
devoid
of
moral
fibre
then
he
informed
her
that
the
regiment
had
given
him
a
farewell
dinner
for
good
and
all
and
now
there
was
nothing
more
urgent
for
him
to
do
than
secure
passage
for
somewhere
if
he
only
knew
where
but
we
wo
scratch
our
heads
about
he
continued
brilliant
people
such
as
you
and
i
have
brilliant
careers
the
path
of
my
life
leads
by
still
waters
of
cool
champagne
and
is
paved
with
little
meat
patties
that
kismet
no
use
struggling
against
it
even
if
it
finally
leads
to
a
plantation
in
louisiana
it
all
the
same
to
me
one
always
comes
across
something
new
and
that
the
main
thing
for
the
present
the
old
man
who
taken
a
tremendous
liking
to
me
wants
me
to
run
about
his
estate
as
fritz
triddelfitz
he
laughed
his
almost
inaudible
laugh
which
shook
him
like
a
storm
lilly
wanted
to
know
who
the
old
man
was
that
a
person
should
have
to
ask
this
seemed
inconceivable
to
him
have
you
the
least
idea
of
life
if
you
do
know
who
the
old
man
is
the
old
man
is
the
the
old
man
decides
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
on
earth
the
old
man
breaks
one
man
neck
and
pays
another
man
debts
he
is
the
punch
bowl
of
all
our
virtues
and
all
our
sins
withal
the
old
man
is
eternally
young
the
old
man
sees
you
and
says
to
you
here
little
girl
i
a
grey
old
horror
but
i
wish
to
have
you
then
you
have
just
enough
courage
left
to
ask
do
you
want
me
high
and
mighty
lord
you
see
child
that
the
old
man
they
hist
him
on
to
you
long
ago
and
if
ever
he
should
find
his
way
to
you
then
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
you
then
all
over
and
done
for
with
my
poor
young
queen
but
i
do
know
yet
who
the
old
man
is
said
lilly
whom
this
enigmatic
alarum
was
beginning
to
make
a
little
uncomfortable
then
do
ask
he
replied
and
held
out
his
freckled
hand
in
it
a
pity
for
us
two
he
added
smiling
at
her
tenderly
and
compassionately
from
between
his
blinking
lids
we
could
so
cosily
have
enriched
history
with
another
famous
pair
of
lovers
leaning
far
over
the
counter
since
i
am
a
man
utterly
devoid
of
moral
fibre
i
should
like
to
bestow
one
kiss
upon
you
before
i
go
lilly
laughingly
held
her
mouth
up
he
kissed
her
and
walked
to
the
door
stiffly
i
can
scarcely
crawl
i
so
knocked
up
by
my
bout
he
said
and
with
that
was
outside
the
door
after
this
visit
lilly
was
seized
with
the
same
disquieting
sense
as
after
his
first
visit
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
being
flicked
in
sport
with
tickling
switches
but
this
time
joined
to
the
other
feeling
was
a
certain
anxiety
which
set
her
nerves
with
a
tormenting
yet
soothing
sensation
as
if
she
were
waiting
outside
a
locked
door
of
gold
behind
which
an
unknown
fate
was
crouching
ready
to
pounce
on
her
chapter
xi
outside
on
the
street
the
hilt
of
a
sword
and
the
buttons
of
a
uniform
glittered
in
the
noon
sunlight
of
a
december
day
a
new
one
thought
lilly
the
stiff
thickset
figure
of
the
man
who
clanked
up
the
steps
of
the
porch
was
unfamiliar
to
her
a
masterful
stamping
outside
the
door
the
bell
rang
more
sharply
than
usual
no
she
did
not
know
him
he
was
not
a
frivolous
lieutenant
nor
yet
one
of
the
maturer
ones
who
played
the
dignified
and
watched
with
an
expectant
smile
for
the
first
shy
glance
in
order
to
extract
from
it
whatever
they
dared
she
saw
eyes
piercing
sharp
as
a
falcon
with
a
close
ring
of
mobile
crows
feet
about
them
she
saw
a
severe
aquiline
nose
and
gaunt
cheek
bones
on
which
lay
a
spot
of
red
finely
chased
with
purple
veins
under
a
short
bushy
moustache
she
saw
thin
compressed
lips
the
corners
of
which
turned
up
in
a
smile
of
mocking
benevolence
she
saw
a
receding
chin
polished
to
a
shine
by
the
shave
and
disappearing
in
two
limp
folds
near
the
high
collar
she
saw
all
this
as
in
a
dream
her
heart
began
to
throb
so
violently
that
she
had
to
lean
against
the
bookcase
why
this
is
what
i
was
afraid
of
a
voice
within
her
spoke
this
is
the
old
man
he
raised
his
hand
carelessly
to
his
cap
but
did
not
think
of
removing
it
colonel
von
mertzbach
he
said
in
a
voice
whose
rough
intonations
spread
a
whole
world
of
authoritative
power
before
her
i
should
like
to
speak
to
you
a
few
minutes
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
to
know
you
lilly
felt
she
was
to
be
subjected
to
a
humiliating
examination
which
she
was
by
no
means
in
duty
bound
to
suffer
but
never
in
her
life
had
she
seemed
so
defenceless
as
at
that
moment
she
felt
as
if
she
were
standing
in
the
presence
of
a
judge
who
had
the
right
to
pardon
or
condemn
entirely
at
his
own
discretion
her
lips
trembled
as
she
stammered
something
meant
to
express
consent
you
seem
to
be
an
extremely
dangerous
young
woman
he
said
why
you
fairly
crazed
my
men
especially
the
younger
ones
there
no
managing
them
i
do
understand
replied
lilly
summoning
all
her
courage
he
uttered
h
stuck
a
monocle
in
his
eye
and
looked
her
up
and
down
or
rather
looked
down
to
the
point
where
the
top
of
the
counter
cut
her
figure
off
then
he
uttered
another
h
and
observed
it
very
easy
to
play
the
innocent
in
cases
like
this
however
that
may
be
i
can
thoroughly
comprehend
my
young
men
probably
i
myself
should
not
have
behaved
differently
but
it
seems
that
despite
your
youth
and
inexperience
you
possess
a
very
respectable
amount
of
feminine
cunning
otherwise
you
would
not
have
succeeded
in
spite
of
your
irreproachably
reserved
manner
or
perhaps
just
of
your
manner
you
would
not
have
succeeded
i
say
in
bringing
the
young
men
here
on
repeated
visits
they
are
somewhat
fastidious
lilly
felt
the
tears
rising
it
would
have
been
easy
to
repudiate
the
insults
he
offered
her
but
from
where
derive
the
strength
to
oppose
a
word
in
defence
to
this
man
whose
eyes
disrobed
her
and
drilled
her
through
and
through
whose
smile
held
her
in
a
wire
net
so
she
sat
down
and
cried
he
in
his
turn
rose
from
his
seat
and
stepped
close
to
the
counter
how
deeply
your
sense
of
honour
has
been
wounded
i
can
not
say
offhand
at
any
rate
it
is
not
my
intention
to
make
you
cry
on
the
contrary
i
should
like
you
to
give
me
with
the
utmost
composure
possible
a
little
information
which
will
enlighten
me
and
which
may
be
of
some
importance
for
your
future
lilly
was
conscious
of
only
one
thought
you
must
pull
yourself
together
because
he
wants
you
to
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
looked
at
him
obediently
sniffling
a
little
as
when
she
had
been
scolded
in
her
childhood
he
asked
her
name
where
she
had
been
born
where
her
parents
were
what
school
she
had
attended
and
what
she
was
doing
in
the
library
at
the
mention
of
her
guardian
name
an
ironic
smile
passed
over
his
face
i
know
the
gentleman
views
he
said
so
in
short
you
have
been
left
absolutely
alone
in
the
world
lilly
assented
and
it
would
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
to
have
some
mainstay
to
know
someone
to
whom
you
could
turn
in
moments
of
need
where
is
a
person
like
that
to
come
from
let
me
think
it
over
at
leisure
he
said
wrinkling
his
forehead
in
any
case
you
can
not
remain
in
this
hole
do
they
treat
you
well
here
at
least
oh
tolerably
said
lilly
and
added
between
laughter
and
tears
only
the
food
is
bad
and
sometimes
i
get
she
was
going
to
say
beaten
but
was
ashamed
to
and
substituted
punished
which
was
a
perversion
of
the
truth
the
colonel
burst
into
a
laugh
that
sounded
like
the
crack
of
a
whip
very
commendable
in
you
to
take
the
matter
humorously
he
said
and
rose
to
go
well
i
know
what
i
wanted
to
know
my
men
may
continue
to
come
to
you
in
uniform
in
civilian
clothes
whichever
way
they
want
they
will
find
no
more
irreproachable
company
among
the
young
ladies
of
this
town
should
they
ever
forget
their
manners
just
drop
me
a
line
but
i
am
sure
they
wo
good
afternoon
miss
czepanek
lilly
watched
him
walk
across
the
porch
with
the
jerky
springy
strut
of
an
old
cavalry
man
the
wintry
sun
seemed
to
be
shining
for
the
sole
purpose
of
casting
a
dancing
radiance
about
his
figure
when
he
reached
the
pavement
he
turned
to
her
window
and
lifted
his
cap
slightly
but
respectfully
the
eyes
behind
the
lowering
brows
pierced
hers
searching
almost
threatening
then
he
passed
out
of
sight
lilly
soul
was
assailed
by
a
tumult
of
questions
what
was
it
what
was
expected
of
her
why
was
she
let
alone
she
wanted
to
cry
wanted
to
pour
out
complaints
and
feel
herself
pitied
but
her
trouble
had
a
certain
festal
tinge
a
certain
shadowyness
and
unreality
she
bedizened
herself
with
it
as
with
a
new
hope
and
what
he
had
said
about
some
one
to
whom
she
could
turn
in
moments
of
need
in
her
soul
like
a
soothing
easing
melody
did
it
seem
almost
as
if
he
himself
wished
to
be
the
mainstay
so
sorely
lacking
in
her
floundering
young
life
perhaps
he
would
get
pieper
who
did
not
concern
himself
about
her
at
any
rate
to
give
up
his
guardianship
over
lilly
or
perhaps
the
colonel
might
even
adopt
her
or
something
like
that
there
was
no
knowing
if
only
there
had
not
been
those
dagger
eyes
that
amused
laugh
and
that
evil
evil
look
at
the
end
and
above
all
her
friend
warning
if
ever
he
should
find
his
way
to
you
then
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
you
however
for
all
that
what
could
possibly
happen
to
her
behind
the
counter
nobody
had
ever
dared
to
raise
the
drop
leaf
and
pass
through
and
surely
she
was
safe
behind
the
bookcase
l
to
n
where
she
could
not
even
be
seen
the
colonel
visit
seemed
to
have
acted
like
a
cold
douche
on
his
men
despite
or
perhaps
on
account
of
the
guarantee
he
had
given
for
their
good
behaviour
not
one
of
them
came
to
visit
her
again
is
that
a
sign
of
the
protection
he
is
to
favour
me
with
lilly
wondered
something
was
missing
she
did
not
know
what
a
week
passed
and
one
day
the
younger
sister
who
held
watch
every
morning
for
possible
threw
an
envelope
at
lilly
feet
saying
something
else
again
with
a
coronet
on
it
you
flirt
you
flirt
was
one
of
the
milder
titles
of
honour
that
the
sisters
lavished
upon
her
lilly
opened
the
letter
and
read
my
dear
miss
czepanek
remembering
the
interview
that
took
place
between
us
recently
i
take
the
liberty
of
making
a
proposition
to
you
the
position
of
private
secretary
and
reader
with
me
is
open
would
you
be
inclined
to
accept
it
since
i
am
an
unmarried
man
it
would
be
in
better
form
for
you
not
to
live
in
my
house
but
i
pledge
myself
to
provide
for
your
maintenance
in
a
suitable
and
respectable
family
your
guardian
whom
i
took
the
opportunity
to
consult
in
the
matter
has
given
his
consent
to
the
plan
respectfully
yours
freiherr
von
mertzbach
colonel
and
commander
of
the
regiment
of
ulans
so
here
it
was
her
fate
it
was
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
gleaming
snowy
street
beckoning
and
calling
to
her
come
out
of
your
hole
i
will
show
you
life
i
will
show
you
something
new
but
then
she
pictured
herself
sitting
at
the
colonel
great
desk
writing
at
his
dictation
she
saw
his
eyes
drilling
her
searching
her
soul
and
threatening
always
threatening
the
pen
would
fall
from
her
fingers
she
would
have
to
jump
up
and
run
away
but
she
would
not
be
able
to
the
eyes
would
hold
her
in
a
spell
so
lilly
sat
down
and
wrote
a
very
correct
letter
declining
his
proposition
she
fully
appreciated
she
said
the
honour
he
did
her
but
she
felt
she
was
not
qualified
to
assume
so
difficult
a
position
and
she
thought
that
even
if
she
was
not
so
well
off
she
did
better
by
remaining
in
her
modest
situation
since
she
could
fulfil
the
duties
it
involved
very
gratefully
yours
lilly
czepanek
done
peace
at
last
restored
as
much
peace
as
the
bad
sisters
permitted
christmas
was
drawing
near
it
can
not
be
stated
with
accuracy
that
the
preparations
in
the
asmussen
household
produced
an
atmosphere
of
mirth
for
weeks
asmussen
had
been
sighing
over
the
bad
times
and
the
nuisance
of
having
to
give
everybody
in
the
world
a
gift
the
sisters
discussed
as
frequently
and
as
loudly
as
possible
the
question
whether
it
was
necessary
for
refined
and
aristocratic
young
ladies
to
share
a
christmas
tree
with
low
and
vulgar
hussies
there
was
no
indication
whatsoever
of
those
gladsome
mysteries
that
at
this
time
brighten
the
saddest
of
human
habitations
lilly
knitted
a
brown
sweater
for
her
mother
bought
her
two
picture
puzzles
a
box
of
sweets
and
a
wooden
vase
for
flowers
objects
of
china
being
breakable
were
not
desired
and
sent
them
to
the
asylum
at
this
time
her
thoughts
frequently
wandered
from
her
mother
to
her
father
who
had
now
been
gone
four
and
a
half
years
and
in
that
time
had
given
no
sign
of
his
existence
in
the
forlorn
condition
she
was
in
her
confidence
in
his
return
waxed
strong
christmas
eve
about
six
or
seven
he
would
suddenly
enter
snow
covering
his
havelock
and
draw
her
into
his
embrace
with
that
demonstrative
ardour
peculiar
to
him
she
almost
breathed
in
the
fragrance
always
streaming
from
his
anointed
locks
that
was
one
way
another
was
a
servant
would
bring
a
little
package
as
a
preliminary
greeting
inside
would
be
costly
material
for
a
dress
a
hat
would
come
too
she
needed
it
badly
after
the
others
had
gone
to
sleep
she
would
fetch
from
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
the
score
of
the
song
of
songs
and
softly
hum
the
more
beautiful
arias
there
were
some
passages
which
always
made
her
cry
oh
she
cried
a
great
deal
these
nights
yet
at
this
very
period
a
tiny
hesitating
sense
of
happiness
found
its
way
into
her
being
it
was
a
lovely
dreamy
feeling
of
being
lifted
up
of
growing
wings
of
astonished
listening
to
inner
voices
which
sounded
sweet
and
familiar
as
words
from
a
mother
lips
yet
strange
like
a
gospel
from
the
mouth
of
one
who
was
still
to
come
now
and
then
she
found
herself
kneeling
in
her
nightgown
but
not
praying
merely
dreaming
with
arms
outspread
and
rapturous
eyes
raised
to
the
lamp
as
if
the
salvation
she
was
awaiting
would
approach
from
somewhere
up
there
thus
after
all
she
celebrated
christmas
in
the
quiet
of
her
soul
christmas
eve
was
at
hand
at
the
eleventh
hour
a
few
gifts
were
scraped
together
the
sisters
ran
about
like
wild
animals
making
their
preparations
they
even
bestowed
a
few
kindly
words
on
lilly
who
showed
her
gratitude
by
winking
when
the
older
sister
had
to
look
for
something
near
the
cash
box
lilly
knew
there
was
not
much
inside
and
should
anything
be
missing
later
she
would
replace
it
from
her
own
funds
a
few
minutes
before
suppertime
she
was
summoned
to
the
back
room
where
the
christmas
tree
was
already
lit
the
company
was
embarrassed
the
sisters
held
out
their
hands
asmussen
who
was
already
sitting
over
her
medicine
glass
delivered
a
few
dignified
words
about
the
significance
of
christmas
in
general
and
her
misfortune
in
particular
in
having
to
forego
the
company
of
so
splendid
a
husband
on
such
an
occasion
then
everybody
asked
everybody
else
pardon
because
the
presents
were
not
more
munificent
first
of
all
there
had
been
a
must
which
ought
not
to
exist
for
refined
souls
and
which
at
first
caused
great
chagrin
then
all
of
a
sudden
time
had
grown
short
besides
the
apron
with
the
red
edge
was
very
decent
they
themselves
had
long
been
wanting
one
like
it
and
the
was
not
to
be
despised
either
above
all
business
had
been
bad
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
give
lilly
answered
but
what
she
was
most
ashamed
of
was
that
she
now
felt
kindly
disposed
toward
the
sisters
i
have
a
bit
of
character
she
thought
as
she
bit
into
the
marchpane
which
the
older
the
wickeder
one
offered
her
the
library
bell
rang
a
lackey
loaded
with
parcels
stumbled
in
and
asked
does
miss
czepanek
live
here
lilly
heart
leapt
from
papa
actually
from
papa
she
rejoiced
for
a
few
moments
she
scarcely
dared
touch
the
packages
she
ran
about
the
room
helplessly
passing
her
hands
over
her
hair
she
did
not
venture
to
undo
the
cords
until
urged
on
by
the
sisters
they
stood
next
to
her
staring
with
great
greedy
eyes
the
things
those
boxes
contained
a
light
cloth
dress
trimmed
with
lace
a
delicate
foulard
dress
a
pink
silk
petticoat
black
patent
leather
and
tan
shoes
six
pairs
of
glacé
and
undressed
kid
gloves
some
of
them
elbow
length
three
kinds
of
collars
a
fichu
of
valenciennes
lace
to
wear
with
empire
gowns
books
writing
paper
conserved
fruit
and
more
things
and
still
more
many
more
the
boxes
seemed
bottomless
even
the
hat
she
had
hankered
for
was
there
a
simple
shepherdess
shape
of
light
grey
felt
which
shape
had
always
been
most
becoming
to
the
grand
style
of
her
features
it
was
trimmed
with
light
brown
ribbons
and
pompons
a
veritable
trousseau
the
sisters
began
to
pull
long
faces
lilly
too
soon
ceased
to
rejoice
she
was
full
of
apprehension
all
she
wanted
now
was
to
find
a
letter
a
card
some
token
of
the
sender
personality
which
surely
accompanied
the
gifts
she
groped
for
it
nervously
though
she
had
long
given
up
all
thought
of
her
father
and
his
return
an
instinct
of
impelled
her
to
pretend
in
the
sisters
presence
that
it
was
he
and
only
he
who
had
poured
this
flood
of
treasures
over
her
at
last
underneath
the
gloves
she
found
an
envelope
and
ran
off
to
the
library
with
it
there
beneath
the
hanging
lamp
she
drew
out
a
visiting
card
and
paled
with
fright
as
she
read
freiherr
von
mertzbach
colonel
and
commander
of
the
regiment
of
ulans
followed
by
a
few
lines
in
the
heavy
bold
strokes
with
which
she
was
acquainted
from
the
depths
of
his
own
loneliness
wishes
his
lonely
little
friend
an
hour
of
christmas
joy
she
returned
to
the
back
room
where
the
sisters
green
with
envy
received
her
with
a
chilly
smile
while
asmussen
nodding
over
the
steaming
glass
dropped
fragments
of
mysterious
words
the
things
actually
do
come
from
papa
said
lilly
amazed
at
the
strange
stifled
sound
of
her
own
voice
the
sisters
gave
a
short
laugh
and
silently
began
to
put
the
gifts
back
into
the
boxes
lilly
was
holding
a
little
porcelain
dish
filled
with
fragrant
confections
she
glanced
hesitatingly
from
one
sister
to
the
other
without
daring
to
offer
them
the
sweets
for
fear
of
being
repulsed
with
some
abusive
word
or
other
she
set
the
lid
a
little
cupid
back
on
the
delicately
cut
rim
let
the
dish
sink
down
among
the
other
gifts
in
one
of
the
boxes
crawled
to
the
corner
where
she
slept
and
cried
bitterly
the
sisters
whispered
together
a
long
time
they
built
a
pyramid
of
the
boxes
on
the
counter
and
passed
by
it
at
a
respectful
distance
the
next
morning
lilly
summoned
a
porter
from
the
street
and
returned
everything
to
the
donor
without
a
word
of
explanation
then
she
went
to
the
sisters
and
said
i
did
tell
you
the
truth
yesterday
the
gifts
did
come
from
papa
so
i
returned
them
the
sisters
who
had
come
toward
her
with
a
air
of
attentiveness
made
no
effort
to
conceal
their
disillusionment
well
i
did
take
her
for
such
a
muff
said
the
younger
she
not
said
the
older
sarcastically
who
true
to
her
nature
scented
an
on
the
contrary
she
particularly
calculating
wants
to
drive
her
adorer
still
madder
i
hope
she
get
stuck
at
her
own
game
even
the
blindest
mortal
soon
comes
to
know
the
difference
between
false
and
worth
therewith
in
order
to
furnish
on
the
spot
an
example
of
the
genuine
quality
she
drew
her
petticoat
tight
about
her
legs
with
her
left
hand
and
with
her
right
hand
gathered
her
matinée
close
under
her
bosom
and
sent
lilly
a
smile
of
utter
contempt
from
over
her
shoulder
such
a
smile
as
only
lofty
souls
can
summon
on
occasion
nevertheless
lilly
noticed
that
from
now
on
she
was
treated
with
a
certain
heedfulness
from
which
she
deduced
that
something
was
still
expected
of
her
during
the
next
few
days
nothing
of
importance
occurred
though
the
day
after
christmas
a
few
of
the
young
gentlemen
had
put
in
appearance
again
their
manner
was
jerky
as
they
exchanged
their
books
they
outdid
themselves
in
politeness
and
they
showed
no
disposition
to
make
themselves
at
home
on
chair
or
counter
then
the
day
before
new
year
lilly
received
this
letter
dear
miss
czepanek
you
shamefully
mistook
the
motives
that
led
me
to
send
you
those
christmas
gifts
i
feel
i
must
justify
myself
and
bring
about
a
perfect
understanding
between
us
i
have
plans
concerning
you
which
i
should
like
to
set
before
you
personally
but
my
position
forbids
my
visiting
you
repeatedly
and
i
would
ask
you
if
your
future
is
dear
to
you
to
come
to
my
house
evening
i
shall
expect
you
some
time
before
eight
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
for
your
safe
return
yours
mertzbach
to
go
or
not
to
go
that
night
lilly
did
not
sleep
a
wink
if
only
the
feeling
of
dread
had
not
obsessed
her
dread
which
robbed
her
of
breath
and
the
power
to
defend
herself
if
the
mere
thought
of
him
brought
it
on
what
would
become
of
her
should
she
stand
before
him
face
to
face
she
finally
decided
not
to
go
while
she
knew
for
a
certainty
she
going
she
lived
through
the
day
as
in
a
dull
dream
in
the
afternoon
she
obtained
permission
from
asmussen
to
attend
new
year
eve
service
the
sisters
who
spied
upon
her
every
movement
exchanged
significant
looks
but
seemed
too
preoccupied
with
their
own
affairs
to
give
hers
their
usual
sweet
attention
lilly
donned
the
old
felt
hat
which
many
a
storm
had
buffeted
and
many
a
shower
discoloured
her
winter
coat
made
her
look
narrow
shouldered
and
tug
as
she
would
the
sleeves
refused
to
reach
her
wrists
if
she
had
had
her
wits
about
her
she
would
have
been
much
too
ashamed
to
show
herself
before
so
aristocratic
a
gentleman
in
that
garb
but
she
was
driven
to
her
acts
by
something
outside
herself
not
by
her
own
volition
strange
mysterious
powers
seemed
to
be
pushing
her
invisible
hands
to
be
helping
her
dress
smoothing
her
hair
lower
on
her
forehead
raising
the
arch
of
her
brows
and
opening
the
buttons
at
her
throat
to
give
her
constricted
chest
the
freedom
of
its
young
fullness
they
rubbed
her
cheeks
pale
from
lack
of
sleep
until
they
glowed
with
a
triumphant
red
when
she
reached
the
street
and
the
frosty
breath
of
the
winter
evening
stroked
her
gently
she
felt
she
was
waking
up
at
last
where
are
you
going
a
voice
within
her
asked
perhaps
to
joseph
she
answered
evasively
but
she
did
not
go
to
joseph
she
made
a
wide
détour
about
anne
crossed
the
altmarkt
diagonally
saw
the
sisters
sitting
at
frangipani
in
the
company
of
two
admirers
with
difficulty
avoided
the
assiduities
of
a
gallant
and
suddenly
found
herself
in
front
of
the
latticed
gateway
behind
which
four
flights
up
the
sewing
machine
had
rattled
and
clattered
the
last
remnant
of
reason
out
of
her
poor
ruined
mother
head
light
was
shining
from
the
two
dormer
windows
up
there
where
lilly
had
once
lived
some
one
else
was
probably
sitting
there
now
sewing
shirts
and
drawers
and
nightgowns
day
and
night
night
and
day
lilly
too
would
be
sitting
there
some
day
bitterly
ruing
her
lost
youth
as
one
regrets
an
act
of
criminal
folly
if
your
future
is
dear
to
you
he
had
written
she
faced
about
abruptly
and
ran
ran
ran
without
coming
to
a
stop
until
she
reached
the
lighted
house
in
front
of
which
a
sentinel
was
pacing
and
freezing
as
he
kept
guard
over
the
highest
dignitary
in
the
city
where
are
you
going
the
voice
within
her
asked
again
to
avoid
answering
she
rushed
up
the
wide
carpeted
stairway
and
came
upon
a
lackey
in
knickerbockers
who
without
question
quietly
relieved
her
of
her
umbrella
while
the
shadow
of
a
mischievous
smile
flickered
across
his
pudding
face
high
white
doors
were
held
open
for
her
lamps
shone
like
great
flowers
beautiful
women
with
tiaras
in
their
hair
smiled
down
on
her
from
oval
gilt
frames
it
was
so
silent
and
warm
in
the
spacious
rooms
you
could
lie
down
on
the
soft
carpet
and
go
to
sleep
if
only
there
had
not
been
that
feeling
of
dread
which
was
tightening
about
her
throat
and
brow
like
a
net
drawn
closer
and
closer
another
door
flew
open
beyond
was
green
twilight
as
in
a
thick
forest
and
from
out
of
the
twilight
figure
came
toward
her
broad
resplendent
clanking
she
felt
her
hand
being
taken
felt
herself
being
led
into
the
green
dusk
bookcases
towered
before
her
like
black
walls
from
somewhere
came
the
threatening
glitter
of
swords
helmets
and
armour
she
did
not
dare
look
at
him
even
after
she
had
been
seated
in
a
tall
dark
whose
top
hung
over
her
head
like
a
canopy
she
had
not
given
him
a
single
glance
she
heard
his
voice
whose
resounding
roughness
seemed
to
have
been
muffled
to
vibrating
organ
tones
it
was
all
unearthly
all
that
she
perceived
and
felt
it
was
not
heaven
it
was
not
hell
it
was
a
region
of
anxiety
and
dreams
where
souls
hovered
between
deprivation
and
fulfillment
in
a
state
of
lethargy
at
last
she
understood
his
words
there
was
nothing
unearthly
about
them
they
dealt
most
rationally
with
the
christmas
gifts
the
return
of
which
he
did
not
consider
final
they
were
securely
stowed
away
biding
the
time
when
their
mistress
would
graciously
deign
to
receive
them
lilly
with
a
frozen
smile
on
her
lips
merely
shook
her
head
she
could
not
summon
the
courage
to
voice
a
refusal
and
now
you
will
ask
me
my
dear
he
began
anew
what
impels
me
a
man
advancing
in
years
to
hang
on
to
your
skirts
like
a
pertinacious
lover
at
the
words
advancing
in
years
she
looked
up
instinctively
there
he
sat
too
sharply
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
green
student
lamp
the
orders
on
his
breast
gave
out
a
subdued
golden
lustre
the
silver
tassels
of
his
epaulets
quivered
and
glittered
like
little
snakes
there
was
a
shimmer
upon
and
around
him
like
the
halo
about
a
saint
in
gold
and
brocade
confused
and
abashed
by
all
this
glory
lilly
quickly
sank
her
gaze
again
i
went
to
you
that
time
he
continued
because
a
dispute
had
broken
out
among
some
of
my
younger
men
of
which
you
were
the
subject
the
matter
promised
to
take
a
dangerous
turn
and
it
had
to
be
adjusted
i
expected
to
find
a
pert
coquettish
little
shop
girl
and
i
found
well
i
found
now
you
will
ask
what
i
mean
by
because
you
yourself
can
not
possibly
be
aware
of
your
good
points
or
rather
your
potentialities
everything
in
you
is
still
in
process
of
becoming
i
am
what
they
call
a
connoisseur
in
women
my
child
and
behind
that
which
you
are
i
see
that
which
you
will
be
some
future
day
this
is
the
main
thing
if
the
opportunity
is
afforded
you
for
proper
development
you
might
go
to
ruin
among
your
old
books
in
case
you
have
the
courage
to
entrust
your
fate
to
my
hands
i
should
like
to
assume
the
care
of
directing
your
life
into
fitting
channels
that
sounded
composed
and
paternal
lilly
felt
herself
breathing
easier
experienced
a
little
relaxing
hopefulness
she
ventured
to
raise
her
look
once
more
and
beyond
the
gold
and
silver
dazzle
she
saw
a
pair
of
brilliant
glassy
eyes
which
had
lost
their
sharpness
and
were
fairly
forcing
themselves
on
her
with
a
mighty
greedy
questioning
the
shuddering
and
stiffening
came
upon
her
anew
she
sat
there
motionless
with
paralysed
will
while
she
thought
of
what
avail
he
will
do
whatever
he
wants
with
me
at
any
rate
he
went
on
i
own
a
beautiful
old
estate
lischnitz
in
west
prussia
near
the
vistula
to
which
my
duties
prevent
me
from
going
frequently
my
household
there
is
managed
by
a
aristocratic
lady
miss
von
schwertfeger
but
her
name
immaterial
if
you
were
to
go
there
she
would
receive
you
with
open
arms
i
promise
you
that
and
you
would
have
an
opportunity
to
develop
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
into
the
woman
i
already
foresee
in
you
your
problems
for
the
time
being
would
be
solved
and
i
should
benefit
by
finding
my
home
when
i
visit
it
lighted
by
a
ray
of
youth
and
beauty
he
had
risen
and
in
his
eagerness
to
persuade
began
to
pace
about
her
with
short
steps
each
time
he
moved
there
was
a
clinking
and
jingling
like
delicate
dance
music
played
on
small
bells
finally
all
she
heard
was
this
metallic
ringing
and
she
no
longer
understood
what
he
said
she
pressed
against
the
back
of
her
chair
with
an
indistinct
feeling
that
he
was
tying
her
with
cords
packing
her
up
and
carrying
her
off
to
some
spot
where
no
rescuer
could
hear
her
cries
of
distress
she
knew
she
would
not
offer
the
least
resistance
so
completely
was
she
in
his
power
look
at
me
he
said
she
wanted
to
obey
certainly
oh
she
was
so
obedient
but
she
could
not
he
put
a
finger
under
her
chin
and
shoved
her
head
back
she
kept
her
eyes
almost
closed
and
saw
nothing
except
the
red
border
of
his
military
coat
suddenly
she
felt
herself
sinking
the
red
border
mounted
to
the
ceiling
bees
buzzed
about
her
ears
then
nothing
when
she
came
to
something
cold
and
wet
was
lying
on
her
breast
and
a
woman
clothes
smelling
of
smoke
grazed
her
cheek
the
green
twilight
was
still
there
a
breastplate
was
hanging
in
front
of
her
it
looked
like
a
brightly
scoured
kettle
she
did
not
dare
move
she
felt
so
comfortable
and
easy
a
rough
bony
hand
kept
chafing
her
forehead
and
a
kindly
voice
repeated
two
or
three
times
in
succession
poor
little
thing
poor
little
thing
so
young
after
a
time
lilly
could
not
help
giving
a
sign
of
consciousness
and
the
instant
she
stirred
a
sure
arm
came
to
the
support
of
her
head
and
the
kindly
voice
asked
was
she
feeling
better
and
did
she
want
anything
i
want
to
go
home
not
so
easily
done
said
the
voice
because
he
gave
orders
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
you
again
but
if
you
take
a
good
piece
of
advice
say
obliged
and
and
be
off
as
quickly
as
you
can
this
is
no
sort
of
place
for
a
poor
young
girl
like
you
lilly
sat
up
and
pulled
down
her
waist
the
cook
was
standing
beside
her
a
brown
furrowed
face
stroking
lilly
shoulder
she
asked
if
she
should
bring
her
something
to
strengthen
her
heart
a
cordial
beaten
up
with
the
white
of
an
egg
or
something
else
i
want
to
go
home
you
shall
pretty
soon
my
dear
but
i
must
call
him
in
first
she
hustled
out
of
the
room
lilly
reached
for
her
hat
on
which
she
must
have
been
lying
because
it
was
completely
crushed
and
misshapen
now
i
must
certainly
get
a
new
one
she
thought
and
tried
to
reckon
how
much
she
could
spare
for
it
the
door
opened
he
entered
followed
by
the
cook
lilly
was
no
longer
afraid
everything
seemed
far
far
away
even
he
nothing
seemed
to
concern
her
any
more
i
think
she
fit
to
be
taken
to
the
cab
already
said
the
cook
you
are
no
longer
needed
here
he
said
imperiously
the
cook
ventured
to
stammer
another
suggestion
get
out
he
thundered
with
that
she
was
outside
the
door
lilly
experienced
merely
a
lazy
sensation
of
being
startled
nevertheless
i
curious
to
know
what
he
means
to
do
with
me
now
she
thought
but
her
interest
in
her
own
fate
was
not
great
he
walked
up
and
down
with
a
heavy
tread
the
silver
spurs
on
his
heels
jingled
we
have
some
light
he
said
the
subject
we
now
to
discuss
requires
clearness
he
summoned
the
lackey
who
had
smiled
the
furtive
cunning
smile
the
lackey
lit
the
gas
jets
of
the
chandelier
and
on
leaving
the
room
gave
lilly
a
glance
of
wildly
eager
curiosity
this
time
without
a
smile
lilly
still
sat
on
the
couch
on
which
she
had
come
back
to
consciousness
twirling
her
old
hat
without
a
thought
in
her
brain
in
the
full
light
of
the
chandelier
she
saw
the
colonel
in
all
his
resplendence
still
pacing
silently
up
and
down
lilly
could
look
him
in
the
face
without
a
flutter
it
all
the
same
to
me
what
he
does
she
thought
i
can
not
defend
myself
at
any
rate
he
moved
a
chair
in
front
of
her
and
sat
down
so
close
that
his
knees
almost
touched
her
now
listen
to
me
my
child
he
said
his
words
rang
out
steely
and
choppy
as
words
of
command
at
a
drill
while
you
were
lying
here
in
a
faint
i
thought
about
you
in
the
other
room
and
came
to
a
decision
but
more
of
that
later
you
have
long
noticed
i
suppose
that
my
feeling
for
you
is
not
paternal
the
older
i
grow
the
less
i
comprehend
fatherliness
to
be
brief
i
am
seized
by
a
passion
for
you
which
rather
upsets
me
if
i
were
ten
years
older
than
i
am
i
am
i
should
say
senile
do
you
know
what
i
mean
lilly
shook
her
head
she
saw
his
face
next
to
hers
so
distinctly
that
had
she
never
looked
upon
it
again
she
would
have
remembered
it
to
the
end
of
her
days
his
eyes
embedded
in
red
puffs
burned
and
bored
again
in
the
way
that
had
frightened
her
so
at
first
his
hair
lay
in
bristling
strands
of
grey
at
his
temples
and
over
his
ears
but
his
moustache
was
black
as
coal
and
shadowed
his
dark
teeth
like
a
spot
of
ink
with
a
white
line
down
the
centre
from
his
mouth
started
the
two
limp
folds
which
passed
his
shiny
chin
and
disappeared
in
the
collar
of
his
military
coat
how
strange
thought
lilly
that
i
must
be
the
mistress
of
that
bad
old
man
but
he
wanted
it
so
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
if
you
were
to
make
inquiries
concerning
me
he
continued
tell
you
that
despite
my
age
i
know
how
to
subdue
women
probably
because
i
never
respected
them
any
too
highly
but
this
time
how
shall
i
say
the
affair
is
in
a
manner
peculiar
i
need
not
conceal
it
i
can
not
sleep
i
have
slept
for
many
nights
which
has
never
happened
to
me
before
such
a
state
of
matters
may
not
continue
and
i
pledged
myself
to
make
an
end
of
the
absurdity
in
some
way
or
other
at
the
death
of
the
old
year
he
looked
at
the
clock
i
have
half
an
hour
still
i
expected
at
a
function
in
short
it
true
i
wanted
to
seduce
you
that
is
for
a
man
of
my
years
who
has
anything
seductive
about
him
any
more
seduce
is
not
the
right
word
at
any
rate
not
here
i
given
my
word
of
honour
in
my
letter
but
you
in
my
power
you
need
not
doubt
that
an
instant
i
do
thought
lilly
who
was
listening
to
all
he
said
with
as
little
concern
as
if
she
were
reading
it
in
a
thrilling
romance
the
old
fear
had
not
returned
she
was
still
waiting
with
lazy
curiosity
for
what
was
to
follow
if
you
had
showed
fight
you
would
have
been
defeated
all
the
more
certainly
i
am
somewhat
of
an
adept
in
such
things
but
your
fainting
spell
occurred
and
gave
me
an
insight
into
your
soul
i
had
to
admit
i
should
never
have
taken
joy
in
my
conquest
you
fine
stuff
and
i
have
no
use
for
someone
who
would
pine
tearful
mistresses
have
always
been
a
horror
to
me
i
love
my
comfort
i
have
had
experiences
i
should
not
like
to
repeat
so
while
you
were
lying
here
with
my
cook
to
take
care
of
you
i
determined
i
was
on
the
wrong
course
lilly
had
a
warm
sensation
of
happiness
as
if
some
great
act
of
kindness
were
being
shown
her
how
noble
how
glorious
of
him
she
thought
to
let
poor
stupid
me
alone
she
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
his
hands
hanging
between
his
knees
they
were
yellow
and
long
and
bony
had
she
not
been
ashamed
to
she
would
have
leaned
over
and
kissed
them
to
show
her
gratitude
the
next
moment
she
felt
almost
sorry
that
so
noble
a
man
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
any
more
i
took
further
counsel
with
myself
he
continued
and
his
voice
was
still
steelier
as
if
tempered
in
the
fire
of
his
resolve
the
idea
was
not
a
new
one
it
had
occurred
to
me
frequently
at
first
it
seemed
ridiculous
then
it
came
to
be
a
last
resort
from
which
i
would
not
cut
myself
off
in
case
circumstances
warranted
i
am
taking
that
way
now
why
should
i
i
not
very
ambitious
i
too
well
acquainted
with
the
vile
machinery
of
the
government
it
does
pay
to
oil
it
any
longer
than
need
be
with
one
sweat
and
blood
so
the
idea
of
quitting
does
frighten
me
of
course
i
shall
have
to
leave
service
perhaps
i
should
at
any
rate
there
are
days
when
i
can
scarcely
keep
the
saddle
because
of
that
cursed
rheumatism
in
my
hips
why
is
he
telling
me
all
this
thought
lilly
not
a
little
flattered
that
so
great
and
aristocratic
a
man
should
discuss
such
weighty
matters
with
her
what
exercises
me
more
is
that
a
whole
generation
stands
ready
to
revenge
itself
for
the
robbery
perpetrated
upon
it
to
be
sure
a
strong
hand
would
do
some
good
we
should
have
to
dare
something
why
not
our
side
as
well
as
the
other
well
what
do
you
say
child
lilly
did
not
reply
she
was
ashamed
that
she
was
so
stupid
as
not
to
have
extracted
a
single
idea
from
all
he
said
his
words
sounded
like
hottentotese
well
will
you
yes
or
no
i
do
know
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
she
stammered
good
lord
i
been
asking
you
all
this
time
whether
you
be
my
wife
said
the
colonel
chapter
xii
the
great
moment
of
her
hopes
had
arrived
is
this
you
lilly
czepanek
to
whom
such
things
happen
or
is
it
someone
else
with
whom
you
changed
places
some
character
in
one
of
your
books
who
will
cease
to
live
the
instant
you
close
it
he
had
not
insisted
on
an
answer
that
new
year
eve
when
she
had
fallen
back
in
a
tremble
incapable
of
uttering
a
syllable
incapable
of
thinking
he
had
taken
her
hands
in
his
and
with
the
smile
of
a
god
had
begun
to
talk
to
her
in
a
softer
gentler
tone
than
she
had
thought
possible
in
him
he
told
her
to
think
the
matter
over
she
might
take
three
days
no
a
week
he
would
have
patience
but
she
must
promise
not
to
say
a
word
about
it
to
anybody
she
promised
willingly
though
she
could
not
look
him
in
the
face
she
was
so
horribly
ashamed
then
she
had
run
home
and
cried
and
cried
without
knowing
whether
from
bliss
or
misery
when
the
sisters
came
creeping
in
at
four
in
the
morning
they
had
let
down
the
bars
of
their
propriety
on
new
eve
she
was
still
crying
on
rising
she
came
to
the
conclusion
he
could
not
possibly
have
been
serious
and
he
would
take
the
first
opportunity
to
recant
perhaps
that
very
day
she
would
not
complain
if
he
did
on
the
contrary
she
would
breathe
freer
and
thank
god
for
having
rid
her
of
the
presence
of
a
phantom
at
ten
the
bell
rang
a
box
of
roses
was
delivered
the
size
and
cost
of
which
aroused
the
disapproving
amazement
of
the
sisters
who
knew
to
a
penny
the
price
of
roses
at
that
season
and
reckoned
a
sum
greatly
exceeding
lilly
wages
for
several
months
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
said
the
older
why
you
do
yield
to
such
a
magnificent
admirer
with
us
of
course
it
different
we
belong
to
society
and
we
can
not
give
ourselves
up
but
you
nothing
more
than
a
shop
girl
with
no
family
to
have
to
consider
besides
there
no
doubt
but
that
shame
has
its
charms
i
in
your
place
would
make
a
venture
the
younger
and
more
sentimental
sister
opposed
the
older
one
advice
the
first
time
it
should
be
from
pure
love
she
said
you
owe
it
to
your
own
soul
even
if
you
are
only
a
shop
girl
without
coming
to
an
agreement
upon
this
debatable
point
they
went
off
to
witness
the
change
of
guards
which
colonel
von
mertzbach
they
said
contemplated
directing
in
his
own
person
on
new
year
day
and
the
colonel
reputed
to
be
a
very
handsome
man
pursued
by
all
the
marriageable
girls
in
society
was
someone
they
wanted
to
see
lilly
patted
and
kissed
the
roses
of
the
upper
stratum
and
would
have
done
the
same
to
all
in
the
box
had
there
not
been
so
many
then
she
took
heart
locked
the
door
and
went
to
anne
to
pay
joseph
a
visit
she
nearly
met
the
officers
hastening
to
the
main
guard
face
to
face
but
managed
in
the
nick
of
time
to
escape
down
a
side
street
high
mass
had
just
concluded
and
had
left
an
odor
of
incense
and
poor
people
between
the
arched
aisles
a
few
persons
were
still
praying
at
the
side
altars
lilly
kneeled
before
her
saint
leaned
her
head
against
the
rail
and
tried
to
lay
bare
her
torn
heart
in
order
to
obtain
counsel
and
help
may
i
shall
i
can
i
oh
she
longed
to
such
a
piece
of
fortune
would
never
come
her
way
again
never
never
to
be
rich
a
baroness
to
have
all
the
splendours
of
the
universe
laid
at
her
feet
where
outside
of
fairytales
do
such
marvels
occur
if
only
there
had
been
one
thing
about
him
but
what
that
one
thing
was
she
could
not
determine
it
was
his
eyes
no
matter
how
they
looked
it
was
the
bristly
hair
on
his
temples
either
nor
the
grating
voice
of
command
now
she
knew
it
was
the
two
dewlaps
that
fell
from
chin
to
throat
yes
that
what
it
was
no
use
trying
to
dissemble
with
herself
and
pretend
she
did
not
see
them
she
shuddered
at
the
mere
thought
of
them
none
the
less
the
sisters
had
called
him
a
man
and
rich
aristocratic
women
ran
after
him
it
would
be
sheer
folly
to
refuse
and
was
he
the
noblest
the
best
the
most
exalted
of
men
was
he
like
god
himself
she
imagined
herself
living
and
breathing
for
him
she
would
sit
at
his
feet
and
learn
she
would
flutter
about
him
like
a
gay
bird
no
she
could
not
imagine
a
person
being
gay
in
his
presence
but
a
person
could
be
poetic
you
could
languish
away
into
unknown
remotenesses
gaze
at
the
evening
clouds
present
a
noble
pale
picture
up
to
which
strange
young
men
would
look
with
consuming
passion
and
be
honoured
by
not
a
glance
in
return
she
could
do
this
because
her
life
would
be
dedicated
to
the
one
who
was
to
be
her
protector
friend
and
father
who
would
elevate
her
to
heights
from
which
otherwise
a
ray
would
never
have
fallen
upon
her
i
will
i
will
life
within
her
cried
dear
joseph
i
will
joseph
raised
a
threatening
finger
but
joseph
always
raised
a
threatening
finger
he
could
help
himself
that
was
the
way
the
sculptor
had
made
him
the
sight
of
that
finger
however
was
vexatious
and
not
calculated
to
help
a
poor
human
being
out
of
a
dilemma
the
next
day
she
received
a
letter
from
pieper
asking
her
to
call
at
his
office
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
hot
and
cold
waves
shivered
up
and
down
her
back
he
knows
she
said
to
herself
asmussen
was
greatly
displeased
when
lilly
asked
for
permission
to
go
out
you
get
flowers
and
expensive
gifts
and
you
want
to
leave
the
library
every
day
i
very
much
fear
me
i
shall
have
to
offer
up
a
daily
prayer
for
you
again
but
lilly
showed
her
the
guardian
letter
and
she
yielded
lilly
had
not
seen
her
guardian
since
the
day
a
year
and
a
half
before
when
she
had
left
the
hospital
tottering
from
weakness
timidity
had
prevented
her
from
availing
herself
of
his
invitation
to
visit
him
again
besides
there
had
been
no
occasion
to
nobody
had
inquired
for
her
from
time
to
time
a
tall
dry
man
whom
she
recognised
as
pieper
managing
clerk
had
called
on
asmussen
and
held
a
short
conversation
with
her
this
was
the
one
sign
that
the
man
to
whose
protection
lilly
had
been
consigned
thought
of
her
pieper
says
will
you
please
walk
in
said
the
clerk
the
prominent
lawyer
as
on
the
previous
occasion
was
sitting
behind
his
desk
when
lilly
entered
he
raised
his
head
and
inspected
her
a
few
moments
in
silence
then
he
smiled
and
rubbed
his
shining
pate
and
said
in
a
long
drawl
u
m
m
so
o
o
his
eyes
glided
over
her
body
as
over
a
piece
of
goods
for
sale
lilly
whose
respect
for
the
man
rendered
her
breathless
made
a
gesture
which
was
half
bow
half
courtesy
and
pulled
at
the
short
sleeves
of
her
overcoat
now
i
understand
continued
pieper
you
have
developed
in
a
way
my
child
which
in
a
measure
excuses
all
sorts
of
masculine
absurdities
even
if
it
does
not
justify
them
the
masculine
intellect
is
here
to
suppress
all
ebullitions
i
forgot
my
manners
good
morning
miss
czepanek
he
rose
and
held
out
his
cold
spongy
hand
which
under
pressure
felt
as
limp
as
if
it
were
boneless
oh
do
please
show
me
your
gloves
he
said
lilly
started
like
a
guilty
thing
drew
her
elbows
back
blushed
and
stammered
i
was
just
going
to
buy
a
new
pair
do
he
rejoined
smacking
his
lips
with
gusto
grey
rags
like
these
arouse
emotion
your
cloak
arouses
emotion
too
your
clothes
make
a
piquant
contrast
to
your
general
appearance
lovers
of
such
naïve
sentimental
things
are
easily
moved
by
them
to
lyric
outbursts
even
if
lyricism
is
not
their
forte
he
laid
his
arm
in
hers
with
a
confidential
manner
and
led
her
to
a
heavily
upholstered
settee
be
seated
in
this
chair
of
torture
he
said
though
we
not
going
to
extract
even
a
tooth
taking
everything
into
consideration
you
have
done
well
for
yourself
i
am
content
with
you
my
child
he
stroked
his
beard
complacently
and
grinned
like
a
trickster
after
the
performance
of
a
particularly
artful
dodge
when
do
you
think
the
wedding
will
take
place
why
there
has
not
been
an
engagement
yet
stammered
lilly
well
there
wo
be
what
is
called
a
real
engagement
sending
out
notices
and
receiving
visits
and
so
on
as
little
stir
as
possible
miss
czepanek
as
little
stir
as
possible
that
my
advice
in
the
delicate
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
contrary
influences
are
always
to
be
feared
i
have
said
yet
lilly
ventured
to
interject
this
amused
him
immensely
who
have
thought
it
a
mock
refusal
who
have
thought
it
i
take
you
for
so
good
a
business
woman
miss
czepanek
i
am
at
a
loss
as
to
your
meaning
said
lilly
who
without
fully
realising
why
was
growing
hot
with
indignation
he
put
one
hand
to
his
hip
and
continued
to
be
amused
well
well
that
all
very
fine
and
practical
but
you
ca
carry
such
jokes
too
far
let
arrange
matters
i
have
some
knowledge
of
these
affairs
though
i
admit
so
important
a
case
has
never
come
to
me
before
i
will
endeavour
to
hasten
the
wedding
as
much
as
possible
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
mentioned
i
will
also
ask
for
all
possible
secrecy
at
least
until
his
resignation
has
been
accepted
then
nothing
need
stand
in
the
way
of
securing
the
banns
since
getting
an
adequate
trousseau
need
concern
us
in
only
a
lesser
degree
as
for
your
conduct
my
dear
child
i
advise
you
for
the
present
to
remain
as
undecided
as
maidenly
as
fresh
as
possible
the
only
change
i
suggest
is
to
use
better
soap
everything
else
may
continue
to
be
just
as
it
is
perhaps
you
will
have
to
be
placed
with
another
family
in
that
case
it
will
be
necessary
of
course
to
get
an
outfit
for
which
the
sum
realised
from
the
sale
of
your
mother
effects
amounting
to
one
moment
please
he
opened
a
large
account
book
lying
on
a
rack
next
to
his
desk
amounting
to
a
b
c
czepanek
amounting
to
one
hundred
and
marks
and
pfennig
will
come
in
very
handy
æsthetic
enjoyment
of
the
circumstances
leads
me
to
place
my
own
purse
also
at
your
disposal
well
so
much
for
the
time
preceding
the
wedding
as
to
the
incomparably
more
important
time
following
i
should
not
like
you
to
leave
my
office
before
i
had
given
you
a
few
delicate
hints
although
i
must
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
he
paused
a
moment
and
rubbed
his
hands
while
an
epicurean
smile
widened
his
broad
face
the
pleasure
of
taking
a
mother
place
and
giving
you
the
advice
with
which
a
mother
usually
sends
off
a
bride
this
time
lilly
understood
him
and
her
hot
shame
seemed
to
spread
a
red
mist
before
her
eyes
you
may
trust
me
implicitly
in
such
matters
as
a
will
life
insurance
and
alimony
in
case
of
divorce
provided
of
course
you
are
the
innocent
party
or
even
in
a
sense
a
bit
guilty
you
were
not
placed
in
my
keeping
for
nothing
however
there
is
circumstance
which
circumstance
has
to
be
taken
most
frequently
into
consideration
in
marriages
like
yours
circumstance
in
which
my
professional
skill
i
am
sorry
to
say
can
not
provide
you
with
adequate
security
as
to
that
you
must
keep
your
eyes
wide
open
for
yourself
we
human
beings
have
been
put
in
this
world
my
child
to
do
what
gives
us
pleasure
whoever
says
the
reverse
steals
the
sun
from
your
heaven
but
i
warn
you
of
three
things
first
exchange
no
superfluous
glances
second
demand
no
superfluous
rendering
of
accounts
third
make
no
superfluous
confessions
you
can
not
fully
comprehend
this
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
lilly
comprehended
not
a
single
word
but
when
the
occasion
arises
think
of
what
i
said
the
recollection
may
prove
useful
and
here
something
very
important
do
you
love
jewels
i
can
not
say
i
have
ever
seen
any
well
in
the
jeweler
window
at
the
altmarkt
we
were
always
forbidden
to
stand
in
front
of
shop
windows
pieper
laughed
his
vilest
laugh
i
advise
you
when
you
are
out
walking
with
your
husband
to
stand
in
front
of
shop
window
such
little
attentions
may
seldom
be
reclaimed
pay
special
regard
to
pearls
in
that
way
you
will
lay
by
a
little
reserve
which
will
stand
you
in
mighty
good
stead
in
your
hour
of
need
and
your
hour
of
need
will
come
you
may
be
sure
it
will
lilly
nodded
her
head
and
thought
i
will
never
never
do
that
pieper
stroked
his
shining
bald
spot
several
times
with
his
plump
white
hand
and
continued
well
what
else
have
i
to
say
to
you
i
have
a
good
deal
more
advice
to
give
but
i
fear
not
being
understood
just
one
thing
for
the
first
few
months
marriage
no
matter
what
sort
of
marriage
causes
a
peculiar
derangement
of
the
nervous
system
in
natures
like
yours
should
you
feel
an
inclination
to
cry
take
a
bromide
in
general
take
plenty
of
bromides
whether
in
case
of
great
love
or
hm
great
aversion
at
certain
times
pull
a
cap
over
your
head
so
that
you
see
nothing
hear
nothing
and
feel
nothing
and
as
it
were
shunt
yourself
off
from
what
goes
on
around
you
yourself
your
volition
and
your
feelings
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
which
will
at
first
envelope
you
will
gradually
evaporate
in
this
case
probably
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
then
you
will
breathe
fresh
air
again
and
instead
of
a
tester
you
will
once
more
see
the
heaven
of
your
maiden
days
but
whatever
happens
it
is
dangerous
when
one
nerves
are
overstimulated
to
direct
one
fancy
too
much
upon
the
immediate
environment
and
seek
the
necessary
compensation
that
very
instant
turn
from
what
is
near
and
dream
about
the
remote
blue
mountains
let
your
happiness
ever
dwell
at
a
safe
distance
you
are
young
it
will
draw
closer
give
it
time
to
become
full
fledged
i
assume
you
have
understood
a
word
oh
yes
i
have
stammered
lilly
who
wished
not
to
be
considered
stupid
though
he
was
right
his
words
fell
upon
her
like
hailstones
of
which
she
was
able
to
gather
only
a
few
here
and
there
nevertheless
she
had
understood
the
last
part
that
about
dreaming
of
the
remote
blue
mountains
it
did
her
heart
good
and
she
would
take
his
advice
however
that
may
be
pieper
continued
some
sentence
or
other
will
occur
to
you
on
occasion
one
point
more
the
most
delicate
of
all
because
it
is
so
to
speak
the
most
spiritual
if
what
is
about
you
gives
no
sound
or
response
if
it
does
not
echo
to
your
call
you
must
not
grieve
nor
attempt
to
alter
it
cracked
bells
should
not
be
rung
rather
make
your
own
music
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
have
a
whole
orchestra
at
your
disposal
i
have
the
song
of
songs
thought
lilly
triumphantly
you
can
not
imagine
my
child
how
important
it
is
when
one
lives
in
such
close
contact
with
another
human
being
not
to
lose
one
touch
with
oneself
keep
a
corner
reserved
for
your
own
thoughts
they
will
amuse
you
greatly
he
who
likes
to
eat
fresh
eggs
must
raise
his
own
chickens
do
forget
that
but
keep
your
corner
to
yourself
offer
no
superfluous
resistance
no
obstinacy
from
the
very
start
you
must
provide
the
course
of
your
life
with
a
double
track
so
that
you
can
ride
in
either
direction
as
need
be
i
should
wonder
if
under
such
conditions
it
would
turn
out
to
be
quite
a
happy
marriage
entirely
apart
from
the
external
advantages
so
long
as
they
last
these
are
matters
of
adaptation
and
good
luck
which
our
will
can
not
control
in
advance
i
will
send
you
the
marriage
contract
sealed
until
your
coming
of
age
in
about
two
years
i
believe
i
am
at
your
disposal
if
after
a
time
you
see
that
the
milk
in
your
cup
has
turned
permanently
sour
break
the
seal
a
thorough
lawyer
can
read
all
sorts
of
surprises
out
of
the
contract
which
laymen
do
not
immediately
realise
but
as
i
said
in
case
he
can
not
beware
of
that
one
case
it
is
called
some
time
cautiously
inquire
into
its
meaning
there
you
are
now
may
i

the

your
consent

the
train
rumbled
on
in
the
night
showers
of
sparks
flew
past
the
window
when
the
stoker
added
coal
a
beam
of
light
was
projected
far
into
the
darkness
and
for
an
instant
created
out
of
the
black
void
purple
pine
trees
snowy
roofs
gleaming
golden
and
fields
mottled
with
yellow
how
beautiful
and
strange
it
was
lilly
leaned
her
head
heavy
with
champagne
back
against
the
red
velvet
cushion
it
was
over
a
whirl
of
images
real
and
imaginary
flitted
back
and
forth
in
her
brain
a
great
black
inkwell
and
a
little
man
with
a
grey
beard
behind
it
asking
all
sorts
of
useless
questions
a
white
cloud
of
lace
and
a
myrtle
wreath
thrown
over
her
head
by
the
wife
of
the
manager
of
the
war
office
who
fell
from
one
fit
of
rapture
into
another
a
hateful
protestant
minister
with
two
ridiculous
little
white
bibs
he
looked
like
a
but
he
spoke
so
exquisitely
after
all
that
you
wanted
to
throw
your
arms
about
his
neck
and
cry
two
black
and
two
gay
gentlemen
one
of
the
black
gentlemen
pieper
one
of
the
gay
gentlemen
the
colonel
the
colonel
wife
the
colonel
wife
throbbed
the
wheels
but
if
she
listened
carefully
she
also
heard
them
say
what
the
gentlemen
had
kept
saying
to
her
that
day
la
dy
mertzbach
la
dy
mertzbach
keeping
time
keeping
time
the
ice
cream
had
been
a
perfect
marvel
a
regular
mine
with
shafts
and
tunnels
and
mineral
veins
and
little
lights
which
set
the
she
could
have
sat
there
forever
staring
at
it
but
she
had
to
dig
in
with
a
large
gold
spoon
so
that
a
whole
mountain
side
gave
way
then
she
had
asked
him
whether
she
might
have
ice
cream
to
eat
every
day
and
he
had
laughed
and
said
yes
if
she
had
not
been
a
bit
tipsy
she
would
not
have
been
so
bold
certainly
not
and
she
determined
to
ask
his
forgiveness
later
there
he
sat
opposite
piercing
her
with
his
eyes
that
was
the
only
embarrassing
thing
if
she
were
such
a
ninny
she
would
ask
him
to
look
somewhere
else
for
a
change
but
she
did
not
experience
actual
fear
latterly
the
old
dread
had
gradually
left
her
as
she
came
to
realise
how
supernaturally
dear
he
was
express
a
wish
and
it
was
fulfilled
there
was
something
else
about
which
of
course
she
could
speak
to
anyone
merely
to
think
of
it
was
a
crime
he
was
regular
cavalry
legs
they
were
a
little
short
besides
for
his
powerful
body
giving
his
stiff
stride
a
springy
sort
of
uncertainty
as
if
he
were
endeavouring
all
the
time
to
toe
the
mark
especially
since
he
had
donned
civilian
clothes
and
kept
his
hands
stuck
in
his
coat
pockets
from
time
to
time
he
leaned
forward
and
asked
are
you
comfortable
little
girl
oh
she
was
ever
so
comfortable
she
could
have
reclined
there
the
rest
of
her
life
her
head
leaning
back
on
the
red
velvet
cushion
the
soft
kid
gloves
on
her
hands
and
the
natty
tips
of
new
boots
every
now
and
then
peeping
from
under
her
travelling
gown
what
a
crowd
there
had
been
at
the
station
no
uniforms
of
course
because
he
had
not
desired
an
official
escort
to
compensate
the
number
of
veiled
ladies
had
been
all
the
greater
they
pretended
to
have
business
to
attend
to
on
the
platform
and
tried
to
be
inconspicuous
when
lilly
walked
to
the
train
leaning
on
his
arm
she
caught
two
or
three
muffled
cries
of
admiration
and
god
knows
they
did
not
issue
from
friendly
lips
it
all
circulated
about
her
heart
like
a
warm
soothing
stream
at
the
last
moment
as
the
train
was
moving
off
two
bouquets
flew
in
through
the
window
she
looked
out
there
were
the
two
sisters
making
deep
courtesies
and
weeping
like
rain
spouts
so
great
was
lilly
fortune
that
even
envy
was
disarmed
and
all
the
evil
poison
in
these
girls
was
transmuted
into
pained
participation
in
another
joy
and
there
he
sat
the
creator
of
it
all
overcome
by
a
sense
of
and
gratitude
she
knelt
on
the
carpeted
floor
of
the
compartment
folded
her
hands
on
his
knees
and
looked
up
to
him
worshipfully
he
put
his
right
arm
about
her
pulled
her
close
to
him
and
let
his
left
hand
stray
down
her
body
fear
came
upon
her
again
she
slid
from
under
his
grasp
back
to
her
seat
he
nodded
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
say
my
hour
will
come
in
due
time
it
was
there
sooner
than
she
had
suspected
put
on
your
coat
he
said
suddenly
we
shall
be
getting
out
soon
where
she
asked
frightened
at
the
station
you
know
from
which
a
branch
line
goes
to
lischnitz
why
are
we
going
to
your
place
lilly
was
terrified
because
he
had
always
spoken
of
going
to
dresden
no
he
said
curtly
we
remain
here
in
a
few
moments
they
found
themselves
on
a
dark
platform
among
their
bags
and
trunks
the
icy
mist
formed
suns
about
the
few
lanterns
and
white
clouds
of
frozen
breath
enveloped
each
shadowy
form
as
it
stepped
into
a
circle
of
light
the
train
glided
off
they
stood
there
and
nobody
concerned
himself
for
them
the
colonel
began
to
swear
violently
a
habit
acquired
probably
at
drill
when
the
world
did
not
wag
as
he
wished
it
to
wag
his
cries
of
wrath
fell
upon
lilly
like
great
hailstones
her
whole
body
quivered
as
if
she
were
at
fault
some
of
the
station
guards
to
whom
this
tone
of
command
seemed
familiar
from
times
of
old
loaded
themselves
with
the
baggage
and
presented
a
lamentable
spectacle
in
their
deep
contrition
a
hotel
coach
was
waiting
on
the
other
side
lilly
thoroughly
intimidated
squeezed
into
the
farthest
corner
the
miserable
little
oil
lamp
burning
dimly
in
a
dirty
glass
case
threw
confused
shadows
upon
his
sharply
cut
face
and
seemed
to
endow
it
with
a
new
flickering
life
as
if
the
wrath
that
had
long
been
stifled
were
still
seething
within
him
you
are
completely
at
the
mercy
of
this
bad
old
man
whom
you
know
who
does
concern
you
in
the
least
and
never
will
concern
you
a
chill
ran
through
her
supposing
you
were
to
dash
by
him
tear
open
the
coach
door
and
run
away
into
the
night
she
pictured
what
would
take
place
he
would
have
the
coach
stopped
would
jump
out
and
give
chase
calling
and
screaming
in
case
she
managed
to
keep
well
concealed
he
would
rouse
the
police
and
the
next
morning
she
would
be
discovered
cowering
in
a
corner
asleep
or
frozen
perhaps
at
this
point
in
her
thoughts
he
groped
for
her
hand
as
lovers
are
wont
to
do
the
phantom
world
vanished
and
blossoming
into
smiles
again
she
returned
his
pressure
nevertheless
when
they
reached
the
hotel
where
they
were
received
by
the
proprietor
and
clerks
with
enthusiastic
bowing
and
scraping
and
lilly
felt
a
stream
of
light
sound
and
warmth
pouring
toward
her
the
fleeting
thought
beset
her
again
if
i
were
to
say
i
had
left
something
in
the
coach
and
were
to
run
away
and
never
come
back
she
was
already
walking
up
the
steps
on
his
arm
they
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
with
a
flowered
carpet
and
a
bare
chandelier
in
one
corner
was
a
huge
bed
with
high
carved
top
and
tail
boards
smoothly
covered
with
a
white
counterpane
she
looked
about
in
vain
for
another
bed
st
joseph
shot
through
her
mind
the
colonel
when
thinking
of
him
she
always
called
him
the
colonel
still
behaved
as
if
he
were
at
home
in
the
room
he
grumbled
a
bit
fussed
with
the
lights
and
threw
his
overcoat
in
a
corner
she
remained
leaning
against
the
wall
if
i
want
to
flee
now
she
thought
i
shall
have
to
throw
myself
out
of
the
window
do
you
intend
to
budge
until
morning
he
said
if
so
i
engage
your
services
as
a
clothes
horse
a
smirking
calm
seemed
to
have
come
over
him
as
if
he
were
at
last
sure
of
his
possession
he
threw
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
lighted
a
cigarette
and
looked
at
her
with
a
connoisseur
gaze
while
she
slowly
divested
herself
of
her
cloak
and
drew
out
her
hatpin
with
hesitating
fingers
a
knock
at
the
door
a
waiter
entered
bearing
a
tray
with
cold
dishes
and
a
bottle
champagne
again
asked
lilly
who
still
had
a
slightly
sickish
feeling
the
very
thing
he
said
pouring
a
foaming
jet
into
the
goblets
it
gives
a
little
girl
courage
to
dedicate
the
lovely
nightgown
waiting
for
her
in
the
trunk
she
clinked
glasses
with
him
in
obedience
to
his
demand
but
scarcely
moistened
her
lips
with
the
wine
he
jokingly
took
her
to
task
and
she
pled
i
should
like
to
be
drunk
on
such
a
sacred
evening
her
answer
seemed
to
gratify
him
immensely
he
burst
into
a
noisy
laugh
and
observed
all
the
better
all
the
better
he
attempted
to
draw
her
down
to
him
but
contact
with
him
made
her
uneasy
and
she
eluded
his
grasp
with
a
quick
movement
you
said
you
wanted
me
to
hunt
for
the
nightgown
she
knelt
at
the
trunk
which
she
herself
had
packed
the
night
before
lifted
the
trays
out
and
from
near
the
bottom
fetched
out
the
nebulous
lacy
creation
which
was
one
of
the
many
things
he
had
bought
her
before
the
wedding
she
looked
about
for
a
retreat
but
nowhere
on
earth
was
there
escape
from
that
pair
of
eyes
which
swimming
in
desire
followed
her
every
movement
hesitating
she
stood
there
her
fingers
hanging
to
her
collar
which
she
did
not
venture
to
unfasten
growing
impatient
he
jumped
up
he
was
about
to
seize
her
but
the
look
she
gave
him
was
so
full
of
despair
that
a
knightly
impulse
bade
him
desist
to
account
for
his
action
he
picked
up
a
roll
of
paper
that
had
dropped
from
the
trunk
while
she
had
been
rummaging
for
the
nightgown
lilly
saw
something
white
gleam
between
his
dark
fingers
the
song
of
songs
occurred
to
her
with
a
cry
she
jumped
on
him
and
tried
to
snatch
away
the
roll
but
his
hand
held
it
as
in
a
vice
he
defended
himself
with
ease
laughing
all
the
time
the
thought
that
the
secret
of
her
life
had
strayed
into
alien
hands
deprived
her
of
her
senses
she
cried
she
screamed
she
beat
him
with
her
fists
the
matter
began
to
look
suspicious
a
doubt
as
to
the
virginity
of
her
soul
yea
even
of
her
body
began
to
assail
him
one
moment
little
girl
he
said
there
are
no
nooks
or
crannies
for
hiding
in
now
either
you
kindly
let
me
see
what
this
is
without
further
delay
or
i
take
you
between
my
knees
and
hold
you
so
fast
you
wo
be
able
to
move
a
muscle
lilly
took
to
pleading
colonel
dear
colonel
a
few
sheets
of
music
and
some
songs
that
all
i
swear
to
you
colonel
the
droll
innocence
of
her
plea
stirred
his
emotions
that
humble
unconscious
colonel
set
him
laughing
again
besides
the
daughter
of
a
musician
as
he
knew
her
to
be
might
be
expected
to
have
ambitions
you
yourself
probably
compose
he
asked
no
no
no
it
not
that
she
moaned
but
do
look
in
give
it
back
to
me
if
you
do
i
jump
out
of
the
window
i
will
by
god
and
all
the
saints
she
pleased
him
so
well
with
her
eyes
stretched
in
deadly
terror
with
her
hair
loosened
by
the
struggle
with
the
expression
of
a
tragic
muse
on
the
sweet
delicately
cut
child
face
that
he
wanted
to
enjoy
the
rare
sight
a
little
longer
accordingly
he
assumed
a
black
expression
and
pretended
to
be
what
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
actually
been
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
clasping
his
legs
stammered
and
whispered
almost
choked
with
shame
and
distress
if
you
give
it
back
to
me
you
can
do
with
me
whatever
you
want
i
will
do
whatever
you
want
i
wo
resist
any
more
the
bargain
it
struck
him
was
to
his
advantage
shake
hands
on
it
he
asked
shake
hands
she
replied
and
never
ask
questions
yes
if
you
swear
to
me
by
your
joseph
it
nothing
but
music
and
the
libretto
i
swear
he
handed
her
the
roll
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
him
sold
herself
to
the
man
who
already
possessed
her
for
the
song
of
songs
of
which
he
had
robbed
her
the
rays
of
early
morning
shining
on
her
eyes
through
curtains
striped
with
yellow
awoke
her
she
was
resting
comfortably
pressed
against
something
warm
she
had
slept
deliciously
what
had
happened
to
her
came
back
to
her
slowly
she
leaned
over
and
wanted
to
kiss
him
he
was
lying
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
mouth
open
the
light
from
the
windows
was
playing
on
his
shiny
furrowed
chin
little
veins
crisscrossed
his
gaunt
cheeks
like
streams
on
a
map
the
inky
moustache
glistened
with
pomade
his
eyelids
were
folded
over
so
often
that
lilly
thought
if
they
were
stretched
to
their
length
they
would
reach
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
he
does
look
bad
she
said
to
herself
but
the
idea
of
kissing
him
passed
out
of
her
mind
she
got
up
without
making
a
sound
and
all
the
time
she
dressed
he
did
not
stir
the
old
cavalry
man
was
blessed
with
sound
sleep
she
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
hotel
paper
have
gone
to
church
laid
the
sheet
between
his
fingers
and
slipped
out
down
the
steps
and
past
the
porter
who
was
so
astonished
he
forgot
to
pull
off
his
cap
the
streets
of
the
little
town
were
dreaming
in
the
quiet
of
the
winter
morning
hillocks
of
snow
swept
from
the
middle
of
the
street
were
heaped
in
rows
along
the
gutters
a
black
swarm
of
crows
squatted
in
a
circle
about
the
frozen
fountain
in
the
the
faint
sound
of
sleigh
bells
penetrated
the
grey
air
boys
carrying
bags
were
wending
their
way
to
school
in
some
of
the
sorry
shops
lights
were
still
burning
apprentices
with
ruddy
cheeks
sweeping
the
steps
stopped
at
lilly
approach
and
stared
or
called
to
others
inside
whereat
more
youths
appeared
and
all
as
if
moved
by
one
spring
goggled
after
her
marching
steps
beat
a
tattoo
behind
her
a
long
line
of
infantry
wearing
gloves
but
no
overcoats
came
tramping
along
the
middle
of
the
street
puffing
clouds
of
frozen
breath
in
front
of
them
at
regular
intervals
all
turned
eyes
left
toward
her
as
if
that
had
been
the
word
of
command
and
the
officers
walking
at
the
side
of
the
line
threw
one
another
questioning
glances
and
shrugged
their
shoulders
she
did
not
have
far
to
search
for
the
catholic
parish
church
which
towered
above
the
roofs
round
about
it
was
a
clumsy
stone
structure
with
remnants
of
gothic
built
over
and
stopped
up
with
bricks
the
alcoves
along
the
side
aisles
were
filled
with
altars
barbarously
gilded
and
decorated
with
cheap
garish
vases
her
joseph
was
nowhere
to
be
found
so
she
contented
herself
with
our
lady
of
sorrows
who
however
did
not
have
much
to
say
to
her
an
inexplicable
feeling
of
oppression
and
emptiness
seized
her
as
if
she
had
broken
something
she
did
not
know
what
she
kneeled
and
mumbled
her
prayers
so
unthinkingly
that
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
then
she
caught
herself
ogling
her
kid
gloves
which
enveloped
her
fingers
with
velvety
inconspicuous
aristocracy
every
now
and
then
a
shiver
ran
through
her
body
which
forced
her
to
close
her
eyes
and
clench
her
teeth
she
was
ashamed
of
the
shiver
too
soon
she
gave
up
praying
entirely
and
regarded
our
lady
who
was
pulling
a
doleful
face
as
if
to
say
do
please
draw
this
thing
out
of
my
body
yet
the
seven
swords
piercing
her
heart
had
handles
set
with
pearls
and
precious
gems
if
only
i
were
unhappy
thought
lilly
i
have
then
i
could
carry
on
a
conversation
with
her
the
way
i
used
to
with
joseph
and
the
swords
in
heart
would
be
sumptuous
to
behold
as
sumptuous
as
the
pearl
chain
he
had
put
about
her
neck
yesterday
at
the
wedding
she
recalled
what
she
had
been
like
two
months
before
when
she
had
stolen
off
for
half
an
hour
in
the
grey
of
early
morning
to
lay
her
hot
surcharged
heart
at
the
feet
of
her
beloved
saint
how
she
had
been
borne
off
on
clouds
by
the
intoxication
of
youth
her
gaze
turned
upon
the
fair
and
blessed
distance
none
the
less
she
had
been
steeped
in
misery
and
utter
destitution
if
that
the
way
happiness
looks
she
went
on
with
her
thoughts
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
suddenly
she
was
beset
with
fear
that
those
times
would
never
return
that
she
would
have
to
live
on
eternally
as
now
distraught
tortured
by
a
dull
oppression
this
comes
of
not
loving
him
enough
she
confessed
to
herself
at
last
she
knew
what
she
had
to
pray
for
to
our
lady
of
sorrows
she
hid
her
face
in
both
hands
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
she
prayed
to
be
able
to
love
him
with
as
much
passion
as
she
had
drops
of
blood
with
as
much
devotion
as
she
had
hopes
in
her
soul
with
as
much
delight
as
there
was
laughter
in
her
heart
and
behold
her
prayer
was
heard
with
the
burden
removed
from
her
soul
her
eyes
shining
she
arose
and
returned
to
the
place
where
she
belonged
to
serve
him
in
humility
and
trust
as
his
child
his
handmaiden
his
courtesan
whichever
he
happened
to
wish
chapter
xiv
the
colonel
wishing
on
account
of
his
mésalliance
to
avoid
his
many
military
friends
did
not
stop
over
at
berlin
with
lilly
but
went
directly
on
to
dresden
which
they
reached
in
three
hours
he
had
engaged
rooms
at
sendig
and
the
proprietor
had
done
his
utmost
to
fit
up
snug
and
aristocratic
quarters
for
the
couple
bedroom
and
bath
that
was
all
they
needed
close
companionship
the
outer
appearance
of
intimacy
would
naturally
bring
about
inward
intimacy
the
colonel
had
good
cause
indeed
to
be
satisfied
with
his
honeymoon
he
who
in
the
course
of
his
many
amours
had
probably
dandled
hundreds
of
girls
on
his
knees
who
thought
he
knew
women
through
and
through
the
tart
and
the
sweet
the
chaste
and
the
coquette
the
sensitive
and
the
bold
the
genuine
and
the
flashy
those
who
confined
their
coy
caresses
to
a
man
hand
and
lower
arm
and
those
who
hung
on
men
lips
biting
and
sucking
them
in
a
wild
frenzy
he
the
old
voluptuary
to
whom
nothing
feminine
ought
to
have
been
strange
stood
astounded
incredulous
before
this
lovely
marvel
so
much
abandon
and
so
much
pride
so
much
tenderness
and
so
much
fire
so
much
ready
comprehension
and
so
much
artless
childishness
all
mingled
in
one
dreamy
laughing
madonna
head
had
never
before
presented
itself
to
him
for
all
the
fine
art
he
had
exercised
in
his
career
what
touched
him
most
and
completely
puzzled
him
was
the
modesty
of
her
desires
the
fact
that
she
made
no
demands
of
any
sort
when
they
took
dinner
la
he
might
be
sure
her
eye
would
travel
to
the
cheapest
orders
for
herself
and
the
expression
with
which
she
would
sometimes
prefer
a
request
to
be
allowed
to
drink
orangeade
was
as
hesitating
and
shamefaced
as
if
she
were
making
a
love
avowal
one
day
on
returning
from
the
grosser
garten
by
way
of
side
streets
lilly
stood
still
in
front
of
a
little
provision
shop
as
a
rule
nothing
could
induce
her
to
look
into
shop
windows
and
the
colonel
curious
as
to
her
interest
in
the
place
extracted
from
her
the
confession
that
she
loved
sunflower
seeds
and
would
he
be
very
angry
if
she
asked
him
to
buy
some
the
more
he
overwhelmed
her
with
gifts
the
less
she
seemed
to
realise
that
money
was
being
spent
for
her
sake
the
long
dearth
she
had
suffered
prevented
her
from
appreciating
the
value
of
money
and
whatever
he
put
into
her
purse
she
handed
out
again
without
hesitation
to
the
first
beggar
she
met
on
the
street
then
again
it
smote
her
conscience
when
he
gave
a
flower
girl
two
marks
for
a
rose
once
upon
her
doing
one
of
these
incredible
things
which
usually
sent
the
colonel
into
epicurean
transports
he
was
seized
with
sudden
distrust
i
say
little
girl
he
said
are
you
an
actress
lilly
did
not
even
understand
him
she
looked
at
him
with
the
great
sad
eyes
of
innocence
she
always
made
on
such
occasions
and
said
what
are
you
thinking
of
since
papa
left
i
have
even
an
actress
i
have
been
inside
a
theatre
once
that
very
day
he
ordered
a
box
and
she
danced
about
the
rooms
with
the
tickets
in
her
hand
wild
with
joy
but
her
delight
was
dampened
by
his
injunction
to
wear
evening
dress
lilly
could
not
comprehend
why
one
should
have
to
bare
one
neck
and
shoulders
in
order
to
be
edified
by
the
winter
tale
besides
the
magnificence
of
the
gowns
filled
her
with
discomfort
she
would
walk
in
awe
about
the
gleaming
gala
robes
as
circumspectly
as
about
a
thicket
of
nettles
the
colonel
had
had
them
made
when
in
a
giving
mood
for
no
real
purpose
since
it
was
impossible
of
course
for
the
present
to
introduce
lilly
to
society
when
she
appeared
before
him
stiff
and
constrained
her
eyes
severely
fixed
her
cheeks
however
glowing
with
the
fever
of
festivity
her
delicately
curved
breast
half
concealed
in
a
nest
of
white
lace
the
fabulously
exquisite
chain
of
pearls
about
her
throat
taller
lither
apparently
more
of
a
blossoming
venus
than
ever
the
old
robber
was
seized
by
intoxication
in
the
possession
of
his
booty
the
magnificent
gown
came
near
being
consigned
to
the
wardrobe
and
the
tickets
to
the
waste
basket
but
lilly
begged
so
hard
that
he
choked
down
his
feelings
and
got
into
the
carriage
with
her
the
colonel
thought
he
had
long
ago
outlived
the
banal
delight
of
shining
in
the
eyes
of
strangers
he
found
he
was
mistaken
the
old
bachelor
experienced
a
new
unexpected
sensation
to
which
he
gave
himself
up
disdainfully
though
feeling
immensely
flattered
after
a
time
he
accepted
his
triumph
as
a
matter
of
course
the
instant
lilly
appeared
in
the
box
the
whole
house
had
eyes
for
her
alone
the
handsome
aristocratic
couple
whose
very
being
together
aroused
speculation
busied
everybody
imagination
and
as
soon
as
the
lights
went
up
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
the
whispering
and
questioning
and
pointing
of
opera
glasses
began
anew
lilly
had
never
before
been
in
a
box
and
on
entering
she
had
started
back
instinctively
feeling
confused
and
alarmed
but
accustomed
as
she
now
was
to
implicit
obedience
she
took
the
chair
to
which
the
colonel
pointed
without
a
word
of
protest
when
she
realised
she
was
the
object
of
general
attention
the
old
numbness
came
over
her
she
felt
as
if
the
woman
sitting
there
speaking
and
smiling
were
not
herself
but
someone
else
whose
connection
with
her
person
was
purely
accidental
she
did
not
awake
from
her
torpor
until
the
hall
was
thrown
into
darkness
again
and
the
curtain
went
up
then
the
play
wafted
her
to
the
land
of
the
poet
breathless
exulting
dismayed
after
this
two
lillies
sat
in
her
seat
the
one
in
blissful
flitting
on
the
wings
of
childlike
fancy
through
heavens
and
hells
the
other
making
precise
gestures
like
a
doll
unconsciously
imitating
the
manners
of
the
at
the
same
time
feeling
a
strange
hot
torturingly
sweet
sensation
creep
over
her
being
the
intoxication
of
the
vain
the
triumph
he
had
celebrated
in
the
theatre
was
not
enough
for
the
colonel
on
returning
to
the
hotel
he
did
not
have
supper
served
as
usual
in
their
rooms
but
led
lilly
to
the
general
dining
room
where
a
gypsy
band
was
playing
and
elegant
folk
of
all
descriptions
were
spreading
their
peacock
feathers
the
game
of
the
box
was
repeated
in
all
but
one
respect
lilly
carried
away
by
the
dreamy
magic
of
the
violins
dropped
some
of
her
coyness
her
cheeks
glowed
her
eyes
swam
and
stretching
herself
a
bit
she
ventured
to
take
a
tiny
part
in
the
sport
two
tables
off
sat
a
blond
young
man
in
full
dress
white
shirt
front
and
black
tie
like
all
the
others
he
kept
staring
at
her
with
hot
persistence
as
if
she
were
a
strange
animal
she
moved
uneasily
under
this
gaze
which
caressed
and
gave
hurt
which
spoke
wild
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
yet
was
nothing
else
than
that
sob
of
the
violins
which
feverishly
quivered
through
her
limbs
up
and
down
her
body
suddenly
her
husband
faced
about
and
surprised
the
admirer
in
the
very
act
he
stabbed
him
with
one
of
his
piercing
glances
and
soon
the
miscreant
vanished
the
colonel
mood
seemed
to
be
spoiled
somewhat
he
said
it
time
to
go
and
led
her
upstairs
when
he
had
her
to
himself
joy
in
his
possession
got
the
upper
hand
again
mounting
to
a
sort
of
triumphal
ecstasy
others
might
pasture
on
the
delights
of
her
evening
attire
the
winsome
asperity
of
her
childlike
features
on
which
life
had
not
yet
left
its
traces
were
good
enough
for
display
down
there
in
the
dining
room
off
with
the
pearl
chain
down
with
the
laces
he
wanted
her
without
covering
of
any
sort
wanted
to
drink
in
with
greedy
eyes
the
secret
of
her
proudly
blooming
body
wanted
to
satiate
his
hungry
old
age
with
the
charms
of
strange
stolen
youth
lilly
helpless
without
will
of
her
own
did
what
she
had
often
done
in
shame
that
flamed
afresh
each
time
she
allowed
him
to
tear
the
last
veil
from
her
body
she
threw
herself
on
the
carpet
and
rose
again
she
danced
she
posed
as
a
worshipper
as
a
maiden
in
distress
begging
for
help
as
a
mænad
a
a
coquette
laughing
between
her
fingers
as
anything
he
wished
this
evening
there
was
an
additional
something
which
burned
in
her
blood
like
venom
a
diffident
desire
which
was
really
a
feeling
of
repulsion
a
love
that
clung
to
him
in
grateful
while
secretly
hankering
for
something
else
for
the
sobbing
of
violins
and
the
hiss
of
conflagrations
a
purple
heaven
dotted
with
stars
and
the
deadly
sweet
yearning
that
dwelt
in
hermione
when
he
had
had
his
fill
of
the
spectacle
and
this
came
soon
because
of
his
years
he
made
her
don
the
loose
gauze
shirt
worked
with
silver
thread
with
which
he
had
presented
her
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
stay
in
dresden
before
he
went
to
sleep
she
always
had
to
dance
in
it
a
while
although
the
metal
woof
was
icy
cold
and
pricked
like
needles
she
soon
became
accustomed
to
it
since
his
will
was
her
law
then
while
she
sat
beside
him
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
smoked
a
cigarette
in
bed
and
laughingly
retailed
smutty
jokes
which
he
called
singing
his
baby
to
sleep
henceforth
it
was
the
colonel
pleasure
to
take
meals
in
the
common
dining
room
he
wanted
to
the
prickly
delight
of
seeing
his
young
wife
admired
and
regarded
with
desirous
eyes
the
value
of
his
property
seemed
to
be
enhanced
in
the
degree
in
which
people
smiled
and
envied
him
the
possession
of
it
as
for
lilly
she
always
took
interest
in
perceiving
the
drunken
sensations
of
that
evening
arise
in
her
again
with
drooping
lids
she
might
feel
the
silent
flame
of
hopeless
desire
burn
in
so
many
hot
young
eyes
round
about
and
carried
away
by
the
lamentations
of
the
violins
and
the
hymns
of
the
cymbals
she
might
flee
to
those
dark
and
blessed
distances
to
which
the
way
had
been
barred
she
did
not
know
by
what
since
the
hour
her
great
happiness
had
come
to
her
never
did
she
permit
it
even
to
occur
to
her
to
return
one
of
the
glances
that
forced
themselves
upon
her
by
so
much
as
the
quiver
of
her
lids
the
young
men
remained
mere
figurants
on
her
stage
as
necessary
as
the
other
accessories
the
lights
the
music
the
flowers
on
the
white
napery
and
the
cigarette
smoke
ascending
to
the
ceiling
in
blue
spirals
nevertheless
it
happened
that
one
day
while
she
was
walking
along
the
street
on
her
husband
arm
a
look
pierced
to
her
heart
it
came
from
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
which
from
afar
had
been
turned
on
her
in
a
friendly
searching
manner
on
coming
nearer
they
flared
up
as
with
a
flash
of
recognition
into
a
sad
fire
she
felt
as
if
she
would
have
to
hurry
after
the
passerby
and
ask
who
are
you
do
you
belong
to
me
do
you
wish
me
to
belong
to
you
she
was
incautious
enough
to
turn
around
and
look
back
at
him
for
only
the
fraction
of
a
second
but
the
incident
had
not
escaped
her
husband
when
she
faced
about
again
she
saw
his
vigilant
eyes
resting
upon
her
in
distrust
and
he
nodded
several
times
as
if
to
say
aha
that
the
point
we
gotten
to
already
is
it
he
remained
absorbed
and
the
rest
of
the
day
that
encounter
was
only
the
first
of
an
endless
series
for
lilly
to
be
sure
she
never
met
the
same
young
man
again
despite
her
diligent
watch
for
him
but
a
host
of
others
took
his
place
passersby
no
longer
remained
mere
figures
in
a
dissolving
view
through
whom
one
looked
as
if
they
were
when
she
saw
a
slim
man
at
a
distance
whose
contour
and
bearing
appeared
youthful
she
wondered
while
waiting
for
him
to
draw
near
what
will
he
be
like
will
he
look
at
me
if
he
found
favour
in
her
eyes
and
if
his
glance
was
not
impudent
yet
was
full
of
astonishment
or
desire
she
would
often
feel
a
pang
which
said
to
her
you
suit
him
far
better
than
this
old
man
at
whose
side
you
are
walking
and
each
occurrence
saddened
her
it
saddened
her
also
if
one
she
was
pleased
with
happened
to
pay
no
attention
to
her
i
not
good
enough
for
him
she
would
think
he
scorns
me
i
wonder
why
he
scorns
me
in
the
dining
room
on
the
brühlsche
terrasse
and
at
other
elegant
places
where
there
is
a
constant
crossfire
of
furtive
glances
her
bearing
in
its
relation
to
her
environment
began
gradually
to
change
she
acknowledged
the
incense
offered
her
by
a
little
grateful
uplift
of
her
eyes
and
she
looked
without
embarrassment
directly
into
the
faces
of
the
scrutinising
ladies
and
although
she
had
the
keen
vision
of
a
falcon
she
would
gladly
have
turned
a
lorgnette
on
them
but
of
this
she
did
not
venture
to
breathe
a
word
to
the
colonel
she
was
often
tormented
by
the
desire
to
bury
her
eyes
in
those
of
the
man
looking
at
her
without
decorum
without
fear
without
reserve
just
as
he
was
doing
it
would
have
been
a
mystic
union
of
souls
which
would
do
her
endless
good
of
this
she
no
longer
harboured
a
doubt
she
was
starving
starving
starving
as
she
had
never
starved
in
her
life
the
colonel
seemed
not
to
notice
in
the
least
what
was
going
on
in
her
though
a
state
of
bitter
warfare
existed
between
him
and
all
whose
glances
besieged
her
the
eyes
of
the
old
ulan
were
ever
on
the
and
the
one
who
was
too
persistent
ardent
or
melancholy
was
stabbed
with
a
dart
from
his
eyes
it
happened
however
that
some
paid
no
attention
to
his
threats
and
even
had
the
audacity
to
return
what
they
received
with
raised
brows
this
would
cause
him
uneasiness
he
would
play
with
his
card
case
and
begin
to
write
something
then
put
the
pencil
back
into
his
pocket
and
as
a
rule
wind
up
with
it
seems
to
me
we
strayed
into
bad
company
we
better
be
going
despite
his
uncomfortable
experiences
he
could
not
get
himself
to
live
alone
again
with
his
young
wife
habituated
from
youth
up
to
motley
associations
he
required
noise
and
light
and
laughter
but
his
suspicions
waxed
and
finally
fastened
upon
lilly
too
he
forbade
the
matinal
visit
to
church
to
which
she
clung
so
ardently
what
she
had
done
following
a
mere
impulse
after
the
first
awaking
at
his
side
had
by
and
by
become
a
custom
and
while
he
slept
his
profound
sleep
she
dressed
without
making
a
sound
and
slipped
out
into
the
freshness
of
early
morning
going
to
church
served
as
a
pretext
generally
all
she
did
was
dip
her
fingers
in
the
holy
water
and
make
her
three
genuflections
sometimes
she
even
contented
herself
untroubled
by
scruples
with
merely
passing
the
church
for
here
was
an
hour
of
golden
liberty
the
only
one
throughout
the
day
first
she
hastened
to
the
augustus
bridge
to
offer
her
breast
to
the
winds
always
blowing
there
and
watch
the
waters
course
by
far
below
then
she
walked
along
the
banks
of
the
river
usually
at
a
wild
pace
in
order
to
gather
in
as
large
a
harvest
of
pictures
and
incidents
as
possible
before
creeping
back
to
her
husband
home
everything
the
hour
brought
was
pregnant
with
significance
the
early
morning
mist
lying
red
on
the
hills
and
descending
to
the
river
in
golden
ribbons
the
chorus
of
the
bells
in
the
altstadt
the
first
timid
bursting
of
the
boughs
already
russet
with
sap
the
joggling
carts
on
their
way
to
market
the
hissing
and
sparking
of
the
swaying
wires
when
the
of
an
electric
tram
swept
along
underneath
them
all
this
was
joy
it
was
life
since
she
was
not
threatened
with
a
gift
in
consequence
she
ventured
also
to
look
into
and
greedily
in
amazement
devoured
every
morsel
of
art
an
end
to
all
this
from
now
on
the
gates
suddenly
swung
shut
through
which
she
had
escaped
for
a
single
hour
her
perfumed
overheated
by
desire
and
indolence
but
she
was
so
soft
and
pliant
that
she
yielded
without
a
murmur
even
in
her
innermost
being
it
was
his
wish
that
was
sufficient
such
a
quantity
of
love
lay
fallow
in
her
soul
and
cried
for
activity
that
in
this
time
of
inner
conflicts
she
proffered
him
a
double
measure
of
tenderness
she
had
to
whether
she
wished
to
or
not
whether
her
thoughts
dwelled
with
him
or
glided
off
on
the
viewless
path
of
dreams
she
was
his
slave
his
plaything
his
audience
she
dressed
him
admired
his
good
looks
rubbed
his
hips
with
ointment
adjusted
the
hare
skin
about
his
loins
to
protect
him
against
his
gout
brought
him
his
sodium
carbonate
when
he
had
eaten
too
much
massaged
his
grizzled
head
with
hair
tonic
the
pungent
perfume
of
which
nauseated
her
and
stood
by
to
help
and
advise
when
he
trimmed
his
moustache
she
did
it
all
with
eager
devotion
and
ingenuous
confidence
as
if
in
ministering
to
her
husband
she
had
found
the
end
and
aim
of
her
existence
nevertheless
he
lost
his
supernatural
qualities
in
her
eyes
became
nothing
more
to
her
than
a
man
knightly
to
be
sure
but
whimsical
and
vain
for
all
his
mental
force
intellectually
indolent
for
all
his
sensitiveness
utterly
brutal
and
for
all
his
thirst
for
love
an
oldish
man
whose
powers
had
long
been
enervated
not
that
she
ever
put
it
in
this
way
to
herself
had
she
seen
his
characteristics
so
clearly
she
might
have
come
to
hate
and
scorn
him
for
she
was
too
immature
to
know
that
the
cauldron
of
worldly
life
brews
the
same
out
of
most
men
souls
provided
the
great
feelings
grow
grey
along
with
a
man
hair
and
he
has
erected
no
altar
for
himself
at
which
he
may
seek
refuge
while
sacrificing
to
it
but
the
picture
her
fancy
had
made
of
him
shifted
and
changed
colours
from
day
to
day
taking
on
now
one
aspect
now
the
reverse
until
a
little
pity
mingled
with
her
terrified
respect
and
her
childlike
relation
to
him
was
tinged
by
a
certain
motherliness
which
would
have
been
ridiculous
had
it
not
had
its
roots
in
the
unfailing
warmness
of
her
heart
which
transmuted
another
weakness
into
cause
for
her
solicitude
oh
if
only
she
had
not
had
to
starve
so
starve
when
sitting
at
a
festive
board
each
day
decked
anew
with
choice
viands
every
morning
lilly
eagerly
read
the
theatrical
and
musical
announcements
posted
in
the
hotel
lobby
only
to
be
drawn
away
swiftly
by
the
colonel
who
in
his
little
garrison
town
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
arts
for
lack
of
exercise
his
organs
for
perceiving
and
enjoying
had
lost
their
functions
and
he
shrank
back
petulantly
from
the
intellectual
work
she
expected
of
him
everything
in
which
he
took
pleasure
the
exaggerated
gaiety
of
the
music
halls
the
display
of
physical
strength
and
agility
the
loud
colours
soon
became
an
abomination
to
lilly
after
her
first
curiosity
had
been
stilled
wild
horses
the
colonel
said
could
not
drag
him
to
shakespeare
or
wagner
again
then
certainly
not
to
a
concert
the
object
of
profoundest
cravings
one
day
she
saw
an
announcement
of
the
fifth
symphony
which
was
bound
to
her
childhood
days
by
a
thousand
ties
she
maintained
silence
as
was
proper
but
when
she
reached
their
room
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
and
cried
bitterly
he
questioned
she
confessed
with
a
bored
laugh
he
made
the
sacrifice
and
took
her
to
the
concert
she
had
not
been
at
a
concert
since
her
father
last
performance
when
she
entered
she
trembled
and
suppressing
her
tears
drew
the
air
in
through
her
nose
you
snuffle
like
a
horse
when
he
smells
oats
joked
the
colonel
do
you
notice
there
the
same
atmosphere
at
all
concerts
she
asked
in
a
joyous
tremour
our
concert
hall
at
home
smelt
just
like
this
but
he
had
not
noticed
the
similarity
of
smell
and
he
did
not
recall
the
fifth
symphony
such
matters
he
began
she
was
indifferent
to
all
that
preceded
the
symphony
she
wanted
to
hear
nothing
but
that
trumpet
call
of
fate
which
had
once
filled
her
when
just
blossoming
into
womanhood
with
a
shudder
of
foreboding
the
call
came
and
knocked
at
people
hearts
and
set
the
knees
of
all
those
who
companions
and
filled
with
the
same
fear
and
the
same
impotence
writhed
like
worms
under
the
blows
of
fate
her
husband
amusedly
hummed
that
was
all
he
understood
of
it
turning
about
softly
to
urge
him
if
possible
to
keep
still
she
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
profusion
of
hair
growing
in
his
ear
it
disgusted
her
if
he
has
hair
in
his
ears
she
thought
as
though
that
were
the
reason
of
his
deafness
to
music
a
profound
despondency
seized
her
never
again
would
she
rejoice
in
the
beautiful
never
again
stretch
arms
in
prayer
to
wrestling
heroism
never
again
quench
her
thirst
for
a
higher
purer
life
at
the
sources
of
enthusiasm
between
her
and
all
that
stood
this
man
who
sang
and
in
whose
ears
there
was
a
little
bush
of
hair
the
soft
consolation
of
the
violins
died
away
unheard
the
melancholy
acquiescence
of
the
andante
found
no
echo
in
her
soul
and
the
triumphant
jubilation
of
the
finale
it
brought
her
no
triumph
tortured
debased
undone
in
her
own
eyes
she
left
the
hall
at
the
side
of
her
yawning
husband
but
her
vital
energy
was
too
sound
her
belief
in
the
sunniness
of
human
existence
too
lively
to
permit
her
to
succumb
to
such
moods
moreover
an
event
occurred
which
lent
new
wings
to
her
being
and
flushed
her
with
the
intoxication
of
bold
hopes
though
little
was
said
about
plans
for
the
immediate
future
it
was
settled
that
they
should
remain
in
dresden
or
some
other
large
city
until
may
and
then
go
to
castle
lischnitz
where
the
household
as
always
in
the
master
absence
was
conducted
by
the
miss
anna
von
schwertfeger
the
colonel
forever
hovering
between
trust
and
distrust
of
his
young
wife
was
seized
one
evening
by
a
fresh
attack
of
doubts
and
tried
to
get
a
view
down
to
the
bottom
of
her
soul
by
questioning
her
as
to
how
often
and
whom
she
had
loved
before
she
met
him
unsuspecting
as
always
lilly
blurted
out
her
two
little
experiences
she
told
of
fritz
redlich
first
because
that
had
been
the
greater
love
and
then
of
the
poor
consumptive
teacher
despite
his
petty
misgivings
her
husband
judgment
had
remained
clear
enough
to
appreciate
the
trustful
purity
of
her
conscience
and
he
sent
his
doubts
to
the
devil
with
the
laugh
he
usually
reserved
for
his
vulgar
jokes
but
lilly
wanted
to
see
his
emotions
stirred
and
warming
up
over
her
own
words
she
described
the
lessons
on
the
history
of
art
and
told
of
the
yearnings
to
see
italy
which
the
poor
moribund
had
enkindled
in
her
with
the
flame
burning
in
his
own
heart
her
cheeks
glowed
her
eyes
swam
beneath
lids
drooping
as
if
with
the
weight
of
wine
she
dreamed
and
fantasied
and
scarcely
heeded
his
presence
suddenly
he
asked
how
would
it
be
would
you
like
to
go
there
lilly
did
not
reply
that
was
too
much
bliss
he
began
to
consider
the
matter
seriously
instead
of
poking
in
one
place
and
vexing
himself
over
all
sorts
of
stupid
people
a
man
might
just
as
well
take
a
seat
in
a
railroad
coach
and
make
a
short
day
run
down
to
verona
or
milan
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
threw
herself
at
his
feet
it
too
much
bliss
life
now
became
absolutely
unreal
a
constant
change
from
ecstasy
to
anxiety
and
back
again
because
something
might
intervene
to
prevent
the
trip
first
of
all
he
had
to
have
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
and
a
norfolk
jacket
such
as
every
aristocratic
traveller
wears
then
there
were
a
dozen
other
hindrances
the
fact
was
he
probably
felt
he
had
grown
too
unwieldy
to
keep
pace
with
her
in
her
ability
to
enjoy
herself
but
something
occurred
to
hasten
their
departure
the
last
few
days
the
colonel
noticed
they
had
been
followed
by
a
pale
individual
six
feet
tall
who
tried
with
stupid
pertinacity
to
attract
lilly
attention
to
judge
by
the
man
appearance
he
was
a
tourist
of
the
race
his
manners
indicated
a
certain
loftiness
and
the
threatening
looks
glanced
from
him
without
leaving
the
faintest
trace
lilly
saw
her
husband
fall
for
the
first
time
into
a
lasting
mood
of
thoughtfulness
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
repeatedly
muttering
i
have
to
box
his
ears
or
i
have
to
look
for
a
second
the
next
day
when
the
colonel
observed
the
importunate
person
trotting
about
ten
feet
behind
them
he
veered
about
suddenly
and
accosted
him
the
blond
titan
looked
him
up
and
down
without
so
much
as
removing
the
short
pipe
from
his
mouth
i
may
look
at
anyone
i
want
to
and
i
may
go
anywhere
i
want
to
he
declared
with
that
he
slightly
shoved
up
the
sleeves
of
his
overcoat
and
struck
a
boxing
attitude
which
foreboding
a
street
row
stifled
all
desire
for
a
knightly
mode
of
chastisement
the
colonel
in
a
final
attempt
to
settle
the
matter
in
an
honourable
fashion
handed
the
stranger
his
visiting
card
which
was
received
with
a
friendly
thank
you
sir
and
the
colonel
opponent
stuck
the
card
in
his
pocket
evidently
without
the
least
inkling
of
the
ominous
import
of
the
formality
passersby
began
to
gather
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
colonel
to
do
but
turn
his
back
the
upshot
of
the
rencontre
was
that
the
englishman
now
assumed
the
right
to
honour
lilly
and
her
husband
with
a
greeting
and
the
colonel
who
tried
to
drown
the
consciousness
of
having
made
himself
ridiculous
in
a
torrent
of
oaths
decided
to
leave
dresden
immediately
this
was
about
the
middle
of
april
in
munich
where
they
stopped
off
a
few
days
to
render
homage
to
the
hofbräuhaus
nothing
especial
occurred
but
the
colonel
had
grown
nervous
he
cast
challenging
pugnacious
looks
at
the
most
harmless
admirers
and
began
to
heap
reproaches
on
head
it
seems
he
would
say
everybody
can
tell
at
a
glance
that
you
are
no
lady
otherwise
you
would
not
be
the
object
of
such
a
number
of
indelicate
attentions
at
any
other
time
lilly
would
have
grieved
bitterly
now
she
listened
to
him
with
an
absent
smile
on
her
lips
her
soul
no
longer
dwelt
on
german
soil
she
was
breathing
the
air
of
the
beloved
country
on
whose
threshold
she
thought
she
was
already
standing
one
night
ride
still
a
short
day
in
bozen
and
then
the
gates
would
open
now
nothing
could
intervene
it
was
in
a
section
of
the
express
that
leaves
munich
late
in
the
evening
and
crosses
the
brenner
pass
in
the
dusk
of
early
morning
lilly
and
her
husband
sat
in
the
seats
by
the
window
the
seat
next
to
the
corridor
had
been
taken
by
a
young
man
who
on
assuming
it
had
saluted
the
other
occupants
with
a
smile
and
then
paying
no
further
attention
to
them
had
become
engrossed
in
a
book
written
apparently
in
italian
so
he
was
an
italian
a
messenger
from
paradise
who
had
come
to
bid
them
welcome
that
was
enough
to
ensure
lilly
interest
she
regarded
him
from
under
lids
to
all
appearances
closed
in
sleep
he
had
a
face
of
a
peculiar
milky
yellow
tint
without
lines
or
shadows
as
smooth
as
if
enameled
a
small
dark
moustache
somewhat
crispy
and
the
hair
on
the
temples
cropped
so
close
that
the
skin
shone
beneath
lilly
wanted
to
see
his
eyes
too
but
he
kept
them
obstinately
bent
on
his
book
though
he
seemed
merely
to
be
skimming
through
it
what
she
admired
most
was
the
peculiar
roundness
and
softness
of
his
movements
you
might
suppose
a
woman
was
clothed
in
that
black
and
white
checked
suit
which
attracted
her
by
its
unusually
aristocratic
appearance
the
silk
shirt
was
violet
and
dark
red
and
a
green
necktie
was
tied
carelessly
about
the
soft
collar
all
these
colours
strange
as
they
looked
went
so
well
together
and
seemed
to
have
been
selected
with
so
much
care
and
refinement
of
taste
that
lilly
grew
quite
uncomfortable
she
almost
felt
the
young
stranger
was
trying
to
force
himself
upon
her
by
his
manner
and
bearing
and
dress
and
above
all
by
his
ostensible
disregard
of
her
it
was
ridiculous
she
was
afraid
of
him
when
the
customs
officers
entered
the
compartment
at
the
austrian
frontier
he
uttered
a
few
words
which
the
officers
understood
for
they
turned
away
from
him
with
deep
bows
at
that
moment
he
raised
his
eyes
and
let
them
rove
about
the
compartment
and
while
the
colonel
was
opening
his
bag
they
rested
for
an
instant
as
if
by
chance
upon
lilly
what
singular
eyes
he
had
they
sent
out
sharp
rays
like
black
diamonds
yet
they
gave
a
caress
a
wicked
sure
caress
which
asked
impatient
questions
questions
that
made
one
blush
the
next
instant
nothing
had
happened
he
was
bending
over
his
book
as
before
and
seemed
not
to
notice
her
but
her
husband
scrutinised
her
with
watchful
cunning
as
if
he
had
found
a
something
in
her
face
for
which
he
had
long
been
searching
there
when
the
train
started
again
the
colonel
disposed
himself
to
sleep
for
the
sake
of
greater
comfort
he
chose
the
unoccupied
seat
next
to
the
corridor
the
stranger
in
order
not
to
be
opposite
him
instinctively
moved
nearer
to
the
centre
by
this
greatly
diminishing
the
distance
between
lilly
and
himself
a
little
more
and
he
would
have
been
sitting
directly
face
to
face
with
her
if
she
had
harboured
an
she
would
have
bestowed
more
attention
upon
her
husband
sleep
but
all
her
senses
were
engaged
in
the
desire
to
avoid
the
stranger
whose
proximity
pricked
her
with
a
thousand
needles
she
pressed
close
into
her
corner
and
spasmodically
stared
out
of
the
window
where
the
illuminated
interior
of
the
coach
was
reproduced
on
the
black
background
as
in
a
dark
mirror
thus
she
could
observe
the
stranger
quietly
without
his
catching
her
in
an
occasional
raising
of
her
lids
the
light
of
the
ceiling
lamp
sharply
lit
up
his
smooth
soft
cheeks
whose
even
sheen
merged
into
bluish
darkness
at
the
temple
a
cheek
formed
for
pressure
and
petting
to
let
your
hand
stray
over
it
gently
must
be
a
great
delight
and
what
long
dark
lashes
he
had
longer
than
her
own
their
shadow
formed
dark
semicircles
reaching
to
the
finely
cut
nostrils
suddenly
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
there
it
was
again
that
caressing
gleam
cold
yet
how
seductive
she
started
in
fright
and
grew
still
more
frightened
at
the
thought
that
he
might
have
noticed
her
fear
he
smiled
a
very
very
faint
smile
and
continued
to
read
her
fancy
wove
more
and
more
anxious
flattering
thoughts
about
him
thoughts
tantamount
to
a
crime
which
weighed
upon
her
like
a
nightmare
of
which
she
could
not
rid
herself
suddenly
an
icy
stream
poured
over
her
heart
she
felt
a
soft
tender
pressure
on
her
left
foot
which
she
must
have
moved
nearer
to
the
centre
quite
involuntarily
for
only
a
short
time
before
it
had
been
close
against
her
right
foot
and
her
right
foot
touched
the
outer
wall
of
the
compartment
what
should
she
do
a
rebuking
i
beg
pardon
an
angry
flaring
up
would
have
roused
the
colonel
and
given
occasion
again
for
suspicion
perhaps
even
for
an
encounter
so
she
slowly
withdrew
her
foot
using
the
utmost
caution
and
pressed
it
against
the
wall
to
prove
to
herself
she
had
rescued
it
but
those
few
moments
of
hesitation
she
knew
it
well
had
made
her
and
this
consciousness
tormented
her
as
the
thought
tantamount
to
a
crime
which
she
had
permitted
to
obsess
her
before
dishonoured
besmirched
she
seemed
to
herself
a
prey
to
each
and
any
man
that
waylaid
her
path
why
find
fault
with
him
the
thing
he
had
impudently
desired
was
it
not
the
fulfillment
of
her
own
impure
wishes
this
notion
fairly
stifled
her
she
wanted
to
jump
up
cry
aloud
and
beg
for
forgiveness
the
stranger
continued
to
read
quietly
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
when
lilly
started
out
of
a
state
of
wakeful
torpor
a
grey
day
was
peering
in
through
the
window
she
saw
a
foaming
torrent
tumbling
into
depths
below
and
beyond
gigantic
green
masses
towering
into
the
heavens
it
was
a
picture
she
had
seen
only
in
her
dreams
convincing
in
its
greatness
dwarfing
all
else
with
its
might
what
she
had
experienced
before
falling
asleep
was
now
a
grotesque
dream
and
had
lost
its
vital
essence
she
looked
about
the
compartment
cautiously
the
stranger
was
lying
stretched
out
in
repulsive
sleep
his
cheeks
swelled
and
sank
as
he
puffed
heavily
he
looked
sallow
and
effeminate
and
disgusted
her
she
turned
more
to
the
side
and
suddenly
saw
her
husband
eyes
resting
upon
her
with
a
rigid
chastising
look
she
started
as
if
caught
in
guilt
are
you
awake
already
she
asked
with
a
constrained
smile
i
did
sleep
a
wink
all
night
he
replied
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
set
her
it
was
both
a
rebuke
and
a
sentence
and
how
he
looked
at
her
they
rode
on
without
speaking
lilly
utterly
disregarded
the
stranger
at
the
hotel
in
bozen
the
colonel
entered
lilly
room
and
said
my
dear
child
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
am
tired
of
the
annoyances
to
which
we
are
subjected
day
after
day
to
what
extent
your
appearance
and
conduct
are
to
blame
or
to
what
extent
my
age
is
the
cause
i
will
not
discuss
however
that
may
be
i
do
not
reproach
you
with
gross
infringement
of
the
laws
of
duty
or
good
taste
and
i
may
not
demand
a
reserve
of
one
who
two
or
three
weeks
ago
was
serving
behind
a
counter
to
teach
you
propriety
requires
time
and
it
is
a
matter
that
i
may
leave
entirely
without
qualms
of
any
sort
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
we
will
take
the
noon
train
back
to
germany
and
we
will
reach
lischnitz
day
after
in
the
evening
perhaps
earlier
in
the
day
lilly
did
not
even
grieve
she
felt
so
humiliated
and
bruised
and
the
land
of
her
dreams
sank
below
the
horizon
chapter
xv
they
reached
lischnitz
late
saturday
night
since
the
colonel
had
prohibited
a
formal
reception
all
lilly
could
see
of
the
castle
and
outbuildings
were
black
shadowy
masses
which
the
veiled
moon
painted
light
on
the
edges
a
couple
of
servant
maids
stood
on
the
steps
holding
lanterns
and
a
very
slim
lady
with
a
waist
and
a
halo
of
red
hair
streaked
with
white
put
a
pair
of
long
extremely
thin
arms
about
lilly
neck
and
in
a
melancholy
cracked
voice
spoke
motherly
words
of
welcome
which
though
intended
to
bring
about
a
speedy
friendship
between
them
intimidated
lilly
and
inspired
her
with
dread
overcome
with
weariness
lilly
sank
into
a
swelling
white
bed
with
gleaming
brass
rods
draped
in
light
blue
ribbons
the
bows
of
which
perched
there
like
great
exotic
butterflies
it
was
these
butterflies
which
the
next
morning
carried
her
from
a
doze
into
full
wakefulness
into
the
new
existence
from
the
ceiling
hung
a
gilded
lamp
with
opaline
shades
and
blue
silk
covers
over
the
shades
a
wainscoting
about
four
or
five
feet
high
ran
about
the
entire
room
and
the
walls
between
the
wainscoting
and
the
ceiling
were
panelled
in
silk
of
the
same
light
blue
as
the
counterpane
and
scarfs
set
in
frames
of
white
enamel
all
this
was
revealed
by
a
beam
of
light
which
came
in
through
the
narrow
space
between
the
curtains
and
threw
a
shining
bridge
across
the
persian
carpet
of
a
yellowish
colour
intertwined
with
blue
joyfully
lilly
sprang
out
of
bed
and
trod
on
the
carpet
which
seemed
to
ripple
in
waves
so
soft
and
long
was
its
nap
nothing
of
the
colonel
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
long
before
he
had
told
lilly
his
bedroom
would
be
apart
from
hers
but
it
can
not
be
far
off
she
thought
it
must
be
on
the
other
side
of
that
shining
white
carved
door
opening
it
softly
she
peeped
into
the
next
room
the
window
curtains
had
scarcely
been
drawn
aside
the
bed
a
huge
piece
of
dark
mahogany
was
empty
though
the
crushed
sheets
and
pillows
testified
to
its
having
been
occupied
there
were
engravings
of
racers
on
the
wall
tall
boots
whips
pistols
some
uniforms
and
on
the
round
a
rack
for
pipes
and
next
to
the
bed
the
tube
of
gout
ointment
so
the
evening
before
though
it
was
her
sacred
duty
to
massage
him
he
had
treacherously
done
it
himself
she
felt
hurt
and
then
a
little
shudder
ran
through
her
it
was
all
so
strange
and
hard
as
if
mysterious
threats
were
lurking
somewhere
she
hastily
shut
the
door
and
retreated
into
her
silk
realm
her
room
had
two
other
doors
one
of
which
opened
on
the
corridor
this
was
the
one
through
which
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
led
her
in
the
night
before
lilly
shuddered
again
without
question
without
asking
permission
the
thin
melancholy
person
of
the
extinct
eyes
and
commanding
manners
had
taken
possession
of
lilly
the
colonel
and
his
housekeeper
had
exchanged
a
glance
a
brief
glance
of
mutual
understanding
which
on
the
colonel
part
said
i
put
her
into
your
charge
and
lilly
was
thrown
on
miss
von
schwertfeger
mercy
the
lady
to
be
sure
had
afterward
tried
to
insinuate
herself
into
lilly
good
graces
by
calling
her
pet
names
and
embracing
her
and
with
her
own
hands
bringing
the
comforting
cup
of
tea
to
lilly
bedside
but
a
voice
within
lilly
who
usually
flew
to
meet
everybody
whether
man
or
woman
with
expectant
trustfulness
had
called
to
her
be
on
your
guard
while
staring
at
the
door
which
the
spidery
fingers
had
thrown
open
for
her
the
night
before
and
recalling
the
incidents
of
the
arrival
lilly
was
overpowered
there
in
the
midst
of
her
gay
glory
by
a
feeling
of
strangeness
and
solitude
which
nearly
broke
her
heart
she
rapidly
put
on
the
morning
gown
which
miss
von
schwertfeger
must
have
unpacked
and
hung
next
to
lilly
bed
after
she
had
fallen
asleep
the
third
door
had
still
to
be
investigated
lilly
hoped
it
would
lead
out
into
the
open
she
cautiously
turned
the
knob
and
drew
back
with
a
little
cry
what
she
saw
fairly
dazzled
her
a
small
room
flooded
with
sunlight
and
filled
with
flowers
smiled
at
her
like
a
tiny
paradise
azaleas
as
tall
as
a
man
spread
their
rosy
coronets
over
a
couch
and
there
was
a
dear
little
secrétaire
inlaid
with
and
tortoise
shell
over
the
top
of
which
a
palm
placidly
waved
its
flattering
fronds
but
that
was
by
no
means
the
most
beautiful
thing
the
most
beautiful
thing
was
the
toilet
table
which
sent
a
lovely
shamefaced
greeting
to
her
from
the
corner
where
it
stood
it
was
draped
with
white
lace
and
the
surface
was
covered
with
a
large
smooth
plate
of
glass
the
mirror
was
tall
and
composed
of
three
adjustable
faces
so
that
you
could
see
yourself
on
all
sides
the
hair
at
the
back
of
your
neck
the
fastening
of
your
dress
everything
lilly
had
long
desired
such
a
mirror
but
had
not
dared
to
ask
for
it
the
room
doubtless
was
her
boudoir
she
lilly
czepanek
owned
a
boudoir
was
the
wonder
conceivable
on
the
glass
plate
lay
all
sorts
of
things
which
you
could
take
in
at
first
glance
yet
expanded
your
eyes
and
your
soul
like
a
divine
revelation
there
were
brushes
three
four
of
varying
degrees
of
hardness
or
softness
an
with
a
charmingly
carved
handle
a
powder
puff
in
an
ivory
box
a
glove
buttoner
a
shoe
horn
everything
of
silver
and
ivory
and
many
more
things
mysterious
in
their
functions
the
significance
of
which
would
have
to
be
learned
gradually
on
each
shone
resplendent
the
gold
monogram
with
a
coronet
above
it
was
enough
to
set
one
wild
after
having
inspected
her
treasures
to
her
heart
content
lilly
prepared
to
extend
her
expedition
of
conquest
to
outlying
districts
the
room
in
which
she
was
had
only
one
window
or
rather
a
glass
door
leading
to
a
balcony
on
which
there
was
a
rocking
chair
and
the
high
railing
of
which
was
partly
overgrown
with
young
creepers
later
in
the
season
when
the
leaves
had
unfolded
all
the
way
a
person
standing
on
the
balcony
would
be
completely
screened
by
walls
of
green
but
now
in
early
spring
there
was
still
so
much
space
between
the
shoots
that
he
might
easily
be
seen
from
below
lilly
softly
opened
the
casement
door
and
slipped
out
into
the
open
air
to
the
left
rising
above
a
wall
were
the
barns
and
stables
which
formed
a
large
quadrangle
about
the
yard
to
the
right
giant
trees
a
chaos
of
mazy
branches
set
with
the
buttons
of
the
leaf
buds
inside
the
labyrinth
the
birds
kept
up
a
scandalous
riot
which
deafened
one
ears
as
with
a
of
sounds
straight
ahead
about
thirty
paces
away
rose
the
gable
roof
of
an
ancient
structure
which
also
bordered
on
the
park
wall
and
seemed
to
open
in
front
on
the
yard
there
at
last
a
few
mortals
were
to
be
seen
two
gentlemen
one
with
a
round
grey
beard
the
other
stout
and
were
walking
up
and
down
the
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
smoking
and
conversing
while
a
third
who
was
that
the
slim
sinewy
young
man
with
the
high
collar
and
light
yellow
gaiters
sitting
at
a
window
pulling
a
red
dog
to
his
lap
by
a
thin
chain
that
was
no
impossible
yes
it
was
it
actually
was
walter
von
prell
it
was
her
merry
friend
who
had
so
to
speak
slunk
off
around
the
corner
the
little
lieutenant
famed
as
one
utterly
devoid
of
moral
fibre
the
only
man
that
had
ever
kissed
her
mouth
except
the
colonel
of
course
but
the
colonel
did
count
there
were
the
silvery
white
lids
and
the
clinking
bracelet
and
the
mute
laugh
which
shook
him
like
a
storm
each
time
the
red
dog
with
the
pointed
ears
fell
from
his
knees
the
only
change
in
him
was
that
the
velvety
head
of
hair
had
been
replaced
by
a
somewhat
unkempt
growth
shining
with
pomade
lilly
laughed
aloud
and
stretched
her
arms
to
him
von
prell
von
prell
she
was
about
to
call
out
but
checked
herself
in
time
no
matter
now
she
knew
she
was
no
longer
solitary
in
that
strange
world
her
merry
friend
was
here
her
comrade
her
playmate
the
man
to
whom
she
owed
her
good
fortune
she
remembered
his
having
said
the
old
man
has
taken
a
tremendous
liking
to
me
and
wants
me
to
run
about
his
estate
as
fritz
triddelfitz
lilly
knew
her
fritz
reuter
well
strange
that
in
all
these
months
it
should
not
have
occurred
to
the
colonel
to
mention
a
word
about
von
prell
being
at
lischnitz
to
be
sure
he
had
seldom
spoken
of
his
estate
even
miss
von
schwertfeger
cropped
up
in
his
mind
only
when
he
wished
to
reprimand
his
young
wife
perhaps
he
suspected
it
was
von
prell
and
no
other
who
had
discovered
lilly
and
brought
her
forth
from
concealment
however
she
would
tell
the
colonel
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
without
an
hour
delay
that
she
had
met
an
old
acquaintance
they
need
not
be
informed
of
the
kiss
to
what
end
it
had
no
more
significance
than
a
kiss
in
a
game
of
forfeits
she
slipped
back
into
the
bedroom
and
a
moment
later
while
she
was
drawing
aside
the
window
curtains
someone
knocked
at
the
door
three
short
sharp
rapid
taps
which
seemed
to
probe
to
the
marrow
of
her
bones
it
was
miss
von
schwertfeger
of
course
who
else
would
have
frightened
lilly
so
lilly
received
a
kiss
on
her
forehead
and
her
cheeks
were
patted
with
every
appearance
of
consideration
and
fondness
but
the
great
colourless
eyes
travelled
silently
up
and
down
her
body
and
a
wry
bitter
smile
hovered
about
miss
von
schwertfeger
fleshy
yet
severely
cut
mouth
the
skin
about
which
was
reddened
as
often
happens
when
women
with
a
fine
skin
age
before
their
time
she
carried
clothes
thrown
over
her
arm
which
lilly
recognised
as
her
own
i
brought
you
these
necessaries
my
dear
she
said
so
that
you
can
dress
this
morning
here
in
the
country
we
do
go
about
in
matinées
besides
directly
after
you
have
breakfasted
we
will
make
a
little
tour
of
the
grounds
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
getting
acquainted
with
the
household
and
the
people
may
i
keep
house
myself
asked
lilly
hesitatingly
if
you
know
how
said
miss
von
schwertfeger
and
gnawed
her
lips
and
squinted
lilly
vaguely
felt
that
her
harmless
query
suggested
the
infraction
of
the
housekeeper
rights
and
trying
immediately
to
atone
for
her
thoughtlessness
she
added
stammering
that
is
i
am
only
asking
for
what
i
will
be
she
was
going
to
say
permitted
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
interrupted
her
and
said
drawing
herself
up
my
dear
child
you
are
the
mistress
here
nobody
is
better
aware
of
that
than
i
but
i
mean
well
by
you
when
i
advise
you
to
ask
for
nothing
at
present
pay
attention
to
nothing
but
your
deportment
upon
that
depends
how
soon
you
will
really
be
that
which
unfortunately
you
are
now
merely
in
name
lilly
depressed
and
humiliated
maintained
silence
the
disciplinarian
was
already
showing
her
fangs
and
i
advise
you
she
continued
to
bear
in
mind
that
you
must
first
study
the
ground
you
will
have
to
tread
in
the
future
for
this
you
need
a
guide
who
knows
a
thing
or
two
of
which
you
are
ignorant
otherwise
you
will
find
yourself
in
difficult
situations
from
which
it
will
be
impossible
to
extract
you
and
that
in
view
of
your
relations
with
the
colonel
would
be
greatly
to
be
deplored
lilly
felt
the
tears
rising
the
old
inability
to
defend
herself
which
was
her
gravest
weakness
took
hold
of
her
again
oh
please
she
begged
folding
her
hands
do
feel
hostile
to
me
miss
von
schwertfeger
extinct
eyes
which
lay
half
buried
under
heavy
lids
lighted
up
was
it
with
a
question
or
with
amazement
or
pity
for
a
moment
she
stared
into
space
turning
her
head
aside
and
lilly
saw
a
noble
bold
profile
of
cameo
cut
which
appeared
to
belong
to
a
different
person
then
lilly
felt
long
arms
about
her
neck
the
embrace
in
which
she
was
held
seemed
warmer
more
genuine
than
any
of
the
caresses
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
yet
bestowed
upon
her
you
a
dear
child
you
a
dear
child
said
she
and
with
that
left
the
room
half
an
hour
later
lilly
dressed
in
the
garments
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
brought
entered
the
dining
room
where
breakfast
was
being
served
by
old
ferdinand
a
heirloom
of
a
servant
that
smooth
fellow
with
the
mischievous
smile
had
been
dismissed
thank
goodness
the
colonel
came
in
from
his
early
ride
his
eyes
sparkling
with
the
pride
of
proprietorship
the
little
crisscross
veins
of
his
gaunt
cheeks
were
filled
with
blood
and
the
grey
brushes
over
his
ears
glistened
with
dew
drops
the
heavy
jacket
he
wore
was
becoming
to
him
and
the
legs
were
hidden
under
the
table
he
looked
like
a
kingly
old
warrior
both
evil
and
lilly
flew
into
his
arms
and
he
said
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
about
the
place
well
do
you
like
your
home
she
kissed
his
hand
for
the
your
home
the
dining
room
was
a
long
chamber
arched
at
each
end
and
filled
with
carved
pieces
of
furniture
darkened
by
age
it
was
only
moderately
lighted
by
three
large
giving
upon
the
terrace
from
which
a
flight
of
railed
stone
steps
led
down
to
the
park
at
breakfast
they
discussed
the
walk
they
had
planned
for
showing
the
young
mistress
her
new
realm
the
colonel
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
as
having
the
people
come
to
the
castle
and
wait
upon
lilly
ceremoniously
they
were
wearing
their
that
day
at
any
rate
and
with
no
derogation
to
themselves
could
receive
her
in
the
spots
where
they
lived
and
toiled
the
upper
employés
the
inspectors
and
bookkeepers
would
come
to
dinner
sundays
as
had
been
the
immemorial
custom
and
take
that
as
the
occasion
for
paying
their
respects
the
youngest
of
them
used
to
be
one
of
my
men
remarked
the
colonel
a
von
prell
he
stopped
short
looked
lilly
over
thoughtfully
then
as
if
reassured
continued
but
he
left
service
some
time
before
i
did
and
he
to
learn
farming
on
my
estate
this
was
the
very
moment
for
lilly
happy
avowal
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
she
could
not
for
all
her
good
intentions
she
could
not
as
it
was
those
great
colourless
eyes
resting
on
her
face
were
putting
her
to
the
proof
however
one
thing
was
certain
the
colonel
knew
nothing
his
silence
had
been
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
deemed
the
gay
dog
worthy
of
mention
how
he
behaving
asked
the
colonel
turning
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
oh
colonel
she
said
with
a
smile
regarding
her
long
bony
fingers
on
which
her
nails
shone
like
you
know
i
never
denounce
unless
i
have
to
such
a
rascal
laughed
the
colonel
lilly
instinctively
taking
her
friend
part
thought
the
lady
words
were
in
themselves
sufficient
denunciation
after
breakfast
they
started
out
on
their
little
expedition
lilly
was
placed
between
the
colonel
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
and
a
pack
of
dogs
all
of
a
sudden
appeared
to
keep
them
company
lilly
thought
them
more
likable
than
anything
else
about
her
the
kitchen
was
visited
first
a
perfect
marvel
of
a
kitchen
with
tiled
walls
porcelain
sinks
and
all
sorts
of
arrangements
lilly
did
not
know
at
what
to
look
first
a
face
was
there
an
old
brown
furrowed
face
with
a
pair
of
moist
eyes
turned
upon
lilly
in
mute
questioning
do
you
recognise
me
lilly
eyes
answered
yes
i
do
but
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
with
her
lips
as
well
as
with
her
eyes
for
fear
miss
von
schwertfeger
would
inquire
concerning
the
decisive
moment
of
her
life
and
come
to
despise
her
still
more
she
gave
the
old
woman
her
hand
and
the
bond
of
friendship
was
renewed
next
they
went
to
the
servants
kitchen
where
the
sunday
soup
was
bubbling
like
a
seething
sea
in
a
huge
copper
vessel
after
this
came
the
laundry
with
its
wringers
and
mangles
resembling
brightly
armoured
monsters
it
was
good
to
smell
the
ancient
odour
of
soap
which
had
nestled
permanently
in
every
nook
and
cranny
in
the
pantries
and
storerooms
rows
of
hams
wrapped
in
grey
gauze
depended
from
the
rafters
like
gigantic
bats
sausages
hung
there
too
and
last
winter
golden
pippins
and
other
fine
apples
were
still
lying
on
straw
beds
long
lines
of
jars
were
ranged
on
the
closet
shelves
you
could
pilfer
sweets
to
your
heart
content
the
party
now
cut
diagonally
across
the
paved
yard
where
the
waggons
and
harvesters
stood
like
soldiers
on
parade
to
the
barns
and
stables
the
stable
of
the
pleasure
horses
heavens
it
was
like
a
upholstered
wicker
chairs
with
footstools
in
front
stood
about
invitingly
a
matting
strip
ran
along
the
stalls
over
each
of
which
a
porcelain
plate
proclaimed
the
name
of
the
noble
animal
within
the
horses
moved
supple
slender
lustrous
necks
and
turned
knowing
human
eyes
to
greet
their
beautiful
mistress
you
will
choose
one
of
these
for
yourself
said
the
colonel
i
do
know
how
to
ride
replied
lilly
embarrassed
the
grooms
standing
about
cap
in
hand
grinned
at
her
uncomprehendingly
a
lady
who
could
not
ride
had
never
before
stepped
into
their
world
the
home
of
the
draught
horses
was
not
nearly
so
interesting
it
was
dirty
and
malodorous
and
the
cow
stalls
nauseated
lilly
but
she
took
good
care
not
to
betray
her
sensations
ready
to
learn
she
patiently
listened
to
the
explanations
the
colonel
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
gave
in
turn
a
difficult
piece
of
work
was
still
ahead
of
them
the
visit
to
the
cottagers
who
had
just
returned
from
church
and
were
standing
before
their
doors
in
expectant
groups
the
oldest
and
most
trustworthy
came
first
there
were
many
new
names
to
learn
many
dirty
hands
to
shake
and
many
eyes
to
look
into
which
stared
at
her
in
respectful
suspicion
lilly
felt
she
was
fairly
well
able
to
cope
with
the
situation
she
found
a
few
friendly
words
to
reach
the
hearts
of
the
old
and
the
sick
and
when
she
stooped
and
drew
on
her
lap
a
blubbering
little
urchin
a
pleased
whisper
ran
before
her
to
smooth
her
path
at
the
end
of
the
settlement
were
two
structures
originally
erected
for
barns
but
later
converted
into
dwellings
small
windows
in
red
and
blue
frames
were
set
in
the
walls
at
irregular
intervals
and
what
had
once
been
the
broad
entrance
had
been
built
up
with
yellow
bricks
here
lived
the
polish
immigrants
who
had
come
as
contract
labourers
from
distant
regions
the
district
in
which
lischnitz
lay
had
been
german
from
times
of
old
and
had
remained
a
german
island
amid
the
invading
flood
of
slavs
for
this
reason
it
was
necessary
to
hold
aloft
the
banner
of
germanism
as
miss
von
schwertfeger
admonished
lovingly
and
lilly
felt
mortified
as
though
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
disavowing
it
red
head
cloths
gleamed
great
blue
intimidated
eyes
prayed
to
her
here
and
there
an
awed
bobbing
to
the
hem
of
her
skirt
a
shy
attempt
to
kiss
her
sleeve
bedzie
pochwalony
jezus
she
heard
in
a
whisper
about
her
and
involuntarily
she
answered
wieki
wiekow
amen
in
the
course
of
her
catholic
bringing
up
she
had
learned
that
this
is
the
answer
to
a
polish
greeting
a
glad
humming
and
buzzing
a
ripple
of
happiness
ran
through
the
fearsome
huddling
little
group
the
lovely
young
had
spoken
their
language
the
language
of
their
god
i
had
no
idea
you
could
speak
polish
said
the
colonel
his
voice
grating
with
blame
of
her
lilly
gave
an
embarrassed
laugh
and
explained
they
tarried
a
shorter
time
at
the
next
entrance
where
a
group
of
young
fellows
in
heavy
grey
jackets
were
twirling
their
caps
and
making
awkward
bows
lilly
scarcely
ventured
to
give
them
a
cordial
nod
even
that
she
felt
was
forbidden
miss
von
schwertfeger
said
not
a
word
but
with
aquiline
nose
in
the
air
held
aloft
the
banner
of
germanism
now
my
dear
she
said
when
they
reached
the
castle
door
put
on
your
dark
blue
cloth
dress
i
have
already
had
it
taken
from
the
trunk
and
pressed
you
will
find
it
in
your
room
and
a
lace
collar
to
wear
with
it
that
is
the
correct
thing
here
for
sunday
dinner
which
we
take
in
the
middle
of
the
day
lilly
obediently
donned
the
blue
gown
it
enhanced
her
slim
grace
her
heart
beat
for
fear
that
her
merry
friend
who
could
not
suspect
she
had
disowned
him
would
betray
both
of
them
at
the
first
meeting
by
a
careless
word
of
recognition
the
dinner
bell
rang
and
the
next
instant
came
those
three
probing
taps
on
the
door
lilly
in
alarm
started
away
from
the
mirror
miss
von
schwertfeger
should
never
discover
she
was
vain
she
looked
lilly
up
and
down
a
while
then
grasped
both
her
hands
and
buried
her
pale
blue
eyes
which
now
flared
up
again
in
the
improbable
eyes
god
grant
she
said
that
you
do
cause
too
much
mischief
in
this
world
my
child
why
should
i
cause
mischief
lilly
faltered
mortified
again
i
do
a
bit
of
harm
to
anybody
miss
von
schwertfeger
laughed
the
one
good
thing
is
you
do
know
who
you
are
she
said
and
drew
her
to
the
corridor
and
down
the
old
stairway
which
cracked
at
every
step
in
the
dining
room
were
four
dark
men
figures
besides
the
colonel
at
lilly
entrance
they
hastily
drew
up
in
line
one
was
the
man
with
the
round
grey
beard
leichtweg
our
chief
inspector
said
the
colonel
the
next
was
the
stout
man
messner
our
bookkeeper
somebody
else
was
introduced
and
then
then
lieutenant
von
prell
who
is
learning
farming
here
said
the
colonel
just
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
the
same
as
to
the
others
no
more
but
my
poor
merry
friend
how
you
look
a
long
fell
below
his
knees
his
head
was
lost
in
his
high
collar
his
clothes
hung
in
loose
limp
folds
every
feature
of
his
every
marionette
movement
bespoke
rigid
formality
and
obsequiousness
lilly
stood
there
lost
in
pity
and
astonishment
if
she
had
not
seen
him
that
very
morning
while
he
was
shake
hands
with
the
gentlemen
she
heard
whispered
behind
her
she
started
and
pressed
the
honest
country
fists
more
firmly
than
beseems
a
chatelaine
but
she
quickly
let
go
von
prell
freckled
hand
which
was
still
well
kept
thank
the
lord
he
wo
betray
us
she
thought
then
came
grace
chapter
xvi
the
finches
were
the
maddest
of
all
the
titmice
too
made
a
racket
and
so
did
the
nuthatches
and
the
blackbirds
behaved
as
if
they
were
lords
of
the
place
while
the
starlings
formed
in
groups
among
themselves
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
world
beside
there
were
the
and
wrens
who
added
a
fair
share
to
the
chorus
but
the
fanfare
of
the
finches
was
too
much
for
ears
accustomed
to
the
tiny
twittering
of
a
caged
canary
old
haberland
knew
them
all
old
haberland
was
the
gardener
who
pottered
about
in
felt
shoes
and
lived
in
a
measure
from
the
bounty
since
he
held
sway
now
over
nothing
but
the
lawn
sprinkler
he
knew
which
birds
nested
on
the
ground
and
which
in
the
branches
he
knew
the
time
each
began
to
sing
and
the
best
place
to
stand
if
you
wanted
to
study
their
plumage
and
habits
it
was
terrible
to
think
that
the
squirrels
had
to
be
shot
lilly
almost
hated
the
old
man
when
he
sallied
forth
his
under
his
jacket
with
evil
intent
against
the
jolly
little
marauders
haberland
maintained
the
vermin
recognised
his
gun
and
scurried
off
when
they
saw
it
the
magpies
and
jays
were
no
friends
of
his
either
his
love
was
the
shy
green
woodpecker
whom
he
had
actually
coaxed
into
nesting
in
the
park
and
that
gay
marvel
of
a
bird
the
hoopoe
came
without
fear
at
any
hour
of
the
day
to
the
back
of
the
castle
where
it
sang
its
hututu
and
transfixed
the
insects
in
the
grass
with
its
curved
sabre
of
a
bill
those
were
mornings
full
of
glow
and
brilliance
such
as
could
not
have
been
since
the
creation
of
the
world
when
you
opened
the
door
at
five
in
the
morning
the
cool
purple
mist
crept
in
and
folded
itself
about
your
body
like
a
royal
mantle
on
the
pond
where
the
reeds
rose
up
over
night
pushed
by
underground
powers
lay
sunlit
vapours
which
gradually
lifted
and
ascended
heavenward
everything
steamed
sometimes
white
lights
seemed
to
have
been
kindled
on
the
lawn
and
the
little
clouds
in
evaporating
rolled
heavily
from
the
glistening
campions
as
though
surfeited
with
the
dew
they
had
drunk
such
mornings
who
can
describe
the
mad
delight
of
the
dogs
when
their
beautiful
young
mistress
appeared
on
the
steps
smiling
clad
in
a
white
blouse
and
short
skirt
and
armed
with
garden
shears
they
had
been
awaiting
her
there
a
long
time
every
now
and
then
emitting
short
impatient
sounds
half
whine
half
yelp
for
had
not
hesitated
an
instant
to
recognise
her
absolute
rule
in
utter
disregard
of
the
pitying
benevolence
with
which
miss
von
schwertfeger
whom
they
detested
stood
by
and
smiled
bebel
the
terrier
the
cleverest
of
all
did
not
count
because
he
sped
after
the
colonel
on
his
early
gallop
but
there
was
pluto
the
setter
who
out
of
employment
at
this
season
gave
chase
to
the
rabbits
on
his
own
account
there
were
schnauzl
the
poodle
and
bobbie
the
dachs
living
in
constant
feud
with
each
other
for
the
first
place
in
lilly
favour
dearest
of
all
was
regina
the
great
dane
one
of
whose
forelegs
had
been
broken
as
if
to
apologize
for
her
disgraced
existence
she
always
crept
back
of
anyone
she
met
but
at
night
to
compensate
she
was
untiring
in
her
watchfulness
and
maintained
a
steady
reign
of
terror
who
can
describe
the
joyous
caracoling
of
the
colts
in
the
pasture
the
craving
for
love
the
yearling
manifested
when
the
mistress
who
always
carried
sugar
with
her
pushed
back
the
bars
and
stretched
her
arms
to
caress
the
slender
heads
of
her
favourites
who
can
describe
the
chagrin
of
the
turkey
cock
great
enough
when
the
pheasants
got
first
peck
at
the
bread
crumbs
but
knowing
no
bounds
when
those
stupid
ducks
squatted
right
on
lilly
feet
as
though
that
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
at
times
his
jealousy
so
swelled
him
with
rage
that
he
even
dared
to
nab
one
of
pluto
ears
but
pluto
disdained
to
do
more
than
shake
him
off
in
scorn
yes
those
were
wonderful
mornings
and
when
the
height
of
the
flowering
season
came
she
never
wearied
of
wandering
about
and
filling
baskets
with
blue
golden
and
snowy
blossoms
until
she
was
fairly
drowned
in
a
floral
sea
after
the
morning
stroll
came
breakfast
when
from
sheer
joy
and
tenderness
lilly
hesitated
about
whose
neck
first
to
throw
her
arms
the
colonel
or
anna
on
certain
confidential
occasions
she
was
called
anna
lilly
in
general
was
very
affectionate
with
miss
von
schwertfeger
despite
her
fear
of
that
lady
censoriousness
and
despite
other
fears
of
which
she
could
not
rid
herself
yes
she
thought
it
was
a
strict
school
indeed
which
she
had
entered
not
a
word
not
a
step
not
a
movement
remained
unobserved
or
if
necessary
unreproved
she
learned
to
sit
at
table
and
in
an
how
to
prepare
and
serve
tea
how
to
invite
a
person
to
be
seated
how
to
begin
a
conversation
how
to
introduce
strangers
to
each
other
without
getting
into
a
muddle
how
to
pass
over
forgotten
names
and
offer
everybody
at
table
a
fair
portion
of
cordiality
all
these
things
lilly
learned
and
oh
much
more
but
they
were
only
the
rudiments
to
be
practised
in
the
small
world
of
the
castle
or
when
occasional
visitors
dropped
in
real
instruction
was
to
begin
in
the
fall
for
then
expeditions
to
neighboring
estates
would
be
undertaken
in
the
meantime
the
colonel
wished
to
avoid
all
contact
with
the
families
round
about
he
could
do
this
without
provoking
comment
his
long
bachelorhood
serving
as
a
plausible
pretext
for
wishing
to
prolong
his
honeymoon
to
the
utmost
by
autumn
lilly
was
to
have
been
converted
into
a
veritable
who
would
do
honour
to
her
husband
name
and
rank
and
whose
tact
and
ease
would
conquer
all
mistrust
whether
at
the
festivities
in
the
homes
of
the
gentry
or
in
the
club
house
this
the
highest
ideal
on
earth
miss
von
schwertfeger
kept
before
lilly
eyes
every
minute
of
the
day
and
lilly
dreamed
of
it
as
she
had
dreamed
of
approaching
examinations
when
in
the
selecta
full
of
fears
and
doubts
she
worked
over
herself
night
and
day
her
soul
found
calm
only
when
she
went
on
one
of
her
rambles
or
better
still
when
she
sat
behind
locked
doors
in
her
boudoir
no
no
heaven
preserve
her
not
her
boudoir
that
was
its
name
the
first
time
she
had
said
boudoir
miss
von
schwertfeger
turned
very
condescending
it
was
a
only
butchers
and
wives
in
miss
von
schwertfeger
eyes
one
and
the
same
would
disfigure
it
with
the
other
name
thus
lilly
stumbled
at
every
step
occasionally
when
he
quartered
officers
on
their
way
through
the
country
the
colonel
as
if
to
test
lilly
social
ability
would
have
her
preside
at
table
with
miss
von
schwertfeger
assistance
each
time
the
same
scene
was
enacted
at
first
lilly
would
be
stiff
as
a
mechanical
doll
incapable
of
addressing
a
word
she
had
not
learned
by
rote
to
these
guests
gleaming
in
military
resplendence
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
would
give
her
courage
gradually
she
would
liven
up
and
even
grow
merry
and
finally
bubble
over
with
harmless
pleasantries
from
where
they
came
flying
into
her
head
she
did
not
know
which
would
so
enrapture
the
gentlemen
most
of
whom
were
well
past
their
prime
that
they
directed
all
their
remarks
to
her
as
if
to
pay
her
court
while
their
eyes
hung
on
her
face
in
enjoyment
and
desire
now
the
colonel
would
grow
uneasy
he
would
cast
furtive
glances
at
miss
von
schwertfeger
who
usually
sat
with
her
eyes
on
her
plate
and
a
wry
smile
on
her
lips
and
then
despite
the
gentlemen
protestations
of
regret
the
ladies
would
leave
the
table
lilly
grew
hot
with
the
fire
she
herself
had
kindled
in
the
heads
of
her
guests
it
caused
her
pleasure
and
distress
and
forced
her
to
sit
at
her
window
until
midnight
staring
into
the
blue
twilight
of
the
park
with
beating
heart
and
quivering
nerves
and
flushed
cheeks
streaming
with
tears
forebodings
of
mad
acts
and
riotous
flashed
up
in
her
brain
a
parching
fever
enervated
her
body
her
clothes
her
room
the
park
the
world
became
too
contracted
a
wild
dance
of
looks
and
flames
a
whirl
of
fiery
red
inured
desirous
masculinity
chased
through
her
head
on
such
nights
when
the
guests
had
at
last
retired
the
colonel
more
or
less
intoxicated
would
force
himself
into
her
bedroom
and
begin
by
reproaching
her
for
not
having
been
ladylike
enough
lilly
would
cry
and
try
to
excuse
herself
then
he
would
kiss
the
tears
from
her
lashes
snatch
her
clothes
from
her
body
and
throw
himself
next
to
her
in
bed
shuddering
with
foolish
pangs
of
conscience
quivering
in
disgust
of
his
drunkenness
happy
nevertheless
to
feel
that
tormenting
tenseness
relax
she
gave
her
body
up
to
him
on
other
nights
when
she
felt
uneasy
and
alone
and
desired
his
presence
when
her
body
as
well
as
her
soul
longed
to
cling
to
him
in
the
humble
sense
of
belonging
to
him
entirely
then
he
was
not
to
be
had
he
kept
his
door
locked
on
the
whole
he
was
loving
and
gracious
to
her
he
handled
her
as
if
she
were
a
gay
fragile
toy
to
be
wound
up
not
too
often
and
each
time
it
has
been
played
with
enough
to
be
laid
aside
carefully
for
use
on
the
next
occasion
this
treatment
suited
her
at
least
she
was
spared
dread
of
those
outbursts
of
wrath
which
set
the
walls
two
or
three
times
a
day
and
frightened
every
living
thing
in
the
vicinity
even
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
not
sure
how
to
take
them
she
silently
set
her
teeth
and
bowed
her
head
as
before
the
inevitable
lilly
could
never
fathom
the
relation
existing
between
the
colonel
and
his
housekeeper
usually
it
seemed
to
her
the
many
years
of
mutual
confidence
had
welded
them
together
inseparably
then
came
times
when
they
studiously
avoided
each
other
the
colonel
in
haughty
preoccupation
with
his
own
affairs
miss
von
schwertfeger
squinting
sarcastically
and
suggesting
by
her
manner
a
feeling
of
rancor
a
menace
now
and
then
it
even
occurred
to
lilly
that
when
the
lady
had
been
young
and
fair
she
had
been
the
colonel
love
but
lilly
dismissed
this
idea
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
far
too
proud
to
endure
the
bitterness
of
such
companionship
and
was
too
dominating
to
tolerate
the
presence
of
such
a
creditor
all
that
lilly
learned
of
her
past
was
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
poor
yet
aristocratic
army
officer
and
had
been
left
an
orphan
with
her
own
living
to
earn
after
her
confirmation
she
had
now
been
managing
the
colonel
household
for
nearly
twenty
years
the
fact
that
miss
von
schwertfeger
homeless
and
without
resources
like
herself
had
also
been
thrown
upon
the
colonel
tender
mercies
gradually
aroused
in
lilly
a
sense
of
sympathy
and
kinship
although
she
could
never
cast
off
a
slight
feeling
that
she
must
be
on
her
guard
against
this
woman
she
really
owed
miss
von
schwertfeger
a
debt
of
gratitude
without
her
ready
advice
lilly
would
have
fallen
innumerable
times
from
the
road
leading
to
the
lofty
heights
where
she
would
sit
enthroned
as
aristocrat
and
lady
of
a
manor
ridiculers
would
have
taken
base
advantage
of
her
modesty
her
sportive
manner
of
equality
would
have
invited
impertinence
she
would
have
ended
in
losing
every
vestige
of
power
perhaps
people
would
even
have
come
to
despise
her
as
it
was
everybody
loved
her
she
found
shining
glances
to
greet
her
in
the
kitchen
in
the
stables
among
the
villagers
and
at
the
lodge
while
in
the
barn
where
the
polish
women
dwelt
behind
smouldering
brushwood
and
drying
wash
she
was
a
veritable
idol
whether
a
rumor
had
gotten
about
of
her
slavic
name
or
her
catholicism
could
not
be
determined
however
that
might
be
the
fact
remained
that
these
strange
despised
people
who
glided
among
the
stiff
and
haughty
germans
with
the
humble
look
of
a
child
in
their
eyes
and
the
plaintive
melodies
of
their
country
on
their
lips
revered
lilly
as
their
redeemer
and
patron
saint
she
liked
to
busy
herself
with
the
gentle
folk
she
visited
the
sick
and
cared
for
the
destitute
the
girls
seemed
to
her
like
poor
sisters
who
needed
watching
over
and
as
for
the
boys
why
they
were
a
charge
that
god
himself
had
put
into
her
keeping
miss
von
schwertfeger
looked
askance
at
these
kindly
attentions
the
people
belonging
to
the
place
she
said
are
beginning
to
complain
that
you
prefer
the
immigrants
to
them
you
would
do
well
to
take
your
walks
in
another
direction
lilly
remonstrated
henceforth
miss
von
schwertfeger
kept
close
watch
and
did
not
leave
her
side
when
the
barn
dwellings
happened
to
be
in
seductive
proximity
miss
von
schwertfeger
even
converted
lilly
to
protestantism
not
in
her
soul
heaven
forefend
love
your
holy
virgin
and
your
joseph
as
much
as
you
want
to
she
said
but
just
remove
that
font
and
those
little
images
from
your
bedside
as
for
going
to
church
you
may
drive
to
krammen
to
attend
mass
on
sunday
of
course
you
may
the
colonel
would
not
think
of
forbidding
you
to
but
take
my
advice
dearest
and
sit
next
to
us
in
our
pew
do
it
for
my
sake
you
wo
regret
it
lilly
did
not
offer
much
resistance
and
by
way
of
reward
received
a
small
altar
to
keep
in
her
room
when
locked
it
looked
like
a
dainty
jewel
casket
but
inside
was
the
infant
jesus
in
the
arms
of
the
madonna
and
oh
joy
there
was
joseph
on
the
left
leaf
of
the
folding
door
and
anne
on
the
right
leaf
lilly
wept
with
delight
nevertheless
she
could
not
love
the
donor
with
all
her
heart
and
all
her
soul
no
matter
how
often
they
sat
together
chatting
confidentially
lilly
remained
in
solitude
and
in
fear
she
did
not
dare
even
to
eat
her
fill
as
if
to
make
up
for
asmussen
mush
lilly
had
developed
a
ravenous
appetite
but
noticing
miss
von
schwertfeger
apprehensive
sidelooks
at
her
heaped
plate
she
usually
rose
from
table
only
half
satisfied
to
stay
herself
until
the
next
meal
she
drew
upon
the
treasures
of
the
storeroom
old
maggie
the
cook
in
whom
she
possessed
a
sworn
ally
kept
watch
to
warn
lilly
of
miss
von
schwertfeger
approach
once
however
the
omnipotent
housekeeper
caught
her
there
and
lilly
dished
up
the
excuse
that
she
wanted
to
learn
housekeeping
which
declaration
was
received
with
condescending
merriment
had
it
not
been
for
old
maggie
lilly
would
never
have
learned
a
single
detail
of
the
management
of
the
large
household
miss
von
schwertfeger
studiously
keeping
her
from
regular
activity
of
any
sort
whether
out
of
vainglory
or
consideration
lilly
could
not
determine
if
lilly
wanted
to
help
with
a
piece
of
work
it
was
done
already
or
she
must
spoil
her
hands
or
she
might
injure
herself
her
passionate
desire
to
learn
horseback
riding
was
also
thwarted
by
miss
von
schwertfeger
who
was
always
discovering
signs
of
approaching
motherhood
though
they
proved
each
time
to
be
false
even
playing
on
the
piano
was
denied
her
the
yellow
old
instrument
of
torture
the
keys
of
which
resembled
the
decayed
teeth
of
a
smoker
just
like
the
colonel
was
not
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
piano
until
autumn
when
they
would
go
to
danzig
to
select
one
she
thought
of
the
times
preceding
her
marriage
hardly
more
than
half
a
year
ago
as
belonging
to
her
youth
she
would
have
ridiculed
one
who
had
told
her
youth
still
lay
ahead
of
her
nineteen
years
it
was
good
that
over
there
in
the
lodge
a
witness
of
her
sweet
foolish
past
was
living
along
in
madcap
thoughtlessness
this
alone
persuaded
her
that
her
maiden
days
had
not
been
a
mere
dream
that
she
had
not
been
a
colonel
wife
from
the
cradle
upward
in
all
this
time
she
had
met
her
merry
friend
only
at
sunday
dinners
when
he
played
a
comic
rôle
making
his
jerky
reverences
in
his
long
frock
coat
sometimes
when
standing
on
her
balcony
at
twilight
behind
the
foliage
now
closegrown
she
saw
him
at
his
window
in
the
lodge
cutting
capers
with
his
wild
little
red
fox
of
a
dog
a
feeling
would
then
come
over
her
that
the
only
person
who
actually
belonged
to
her
in
this
alien
world
was
yon
who
pursued
all
the
maids
on
the
demesne
old
maggie
told
tales
at
night
he
would
ruin
the
toughest
horses
trying
to
get
back
from
his
secret
excursions
before
dawn
and
in
his
den
behind
closed
shutters
at
this
point
maggie
lost
her
faculty
of
speech
the
things
that
took
place
behind
those
closed
shutters
must
have
been
dreadful

dress
was
standing
at
the
table
smiling
to
herself
it
was
not
her
manner
it
was
not
her
greeting
both
were
as
usual
it
was
an
intangible
something
which
instantly
caused
lilly
to
realize
that
an
extraordinary
event
had
occurred
katie
she
noticed
who
helped
ferdinand
with
the
serving
had
red
eyelids
and
kept
gnawing
her
lips
while
setting
the
table
katie
was
of
finer
material
than
the
average
servant
girl
her
father
having
been
a
teacher
and
was
very
pretty
besides
owing
to
which
qualities
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
selected
her
as
lilly
special
maid
when
katie
left
the
room
lilly
began
to
ask
questions
in
reply
miss
von
schwertfeger
merely
kissed
her
with
redoubled
tenderness
and
observed
why
should
you
sully
your
pure
young
spirit
with
such
ugly
things
if
certain
people
are
bent
upon
breaking
their
necks
that
their
business
we
can
not
help
them
breaking
their
necks
that
must
mean
walter
von
prell
thought
lilly
and
said
aloud
after
all
this
is
my
home
and
nothing
that
happens
here
in
my
future
province
she
modestly
said
future
ought
to
be
kept
from
me
miss
von
schwertfeger
yielded
to
her
arguments
it
will
be
painful
to
you
she
said
because
i
know
you
like
him
him
whom
queried
lilly
conscious
of
blushing
in
fact
all
of
us
like
him
continued
miss
von
schwertfeger
by
way
of
mitigation
the
colonel
most
of
all
so
long
as
he
confined
himself
to
the
rooms
of
the
labourers
girls
i
winked
my
eyes
and
begged
the
kitchen
help
not
to
annoy
me
with
gossip
about
his
adventures
but
if
he
commits
the
outrage
of
breaking
into
the
castle
it
time
the
matter
ended
why
what
did
he
do
asked
lilly
in
fright
for
some
weeks
past
i
noticed
certain
things
which
struck
me
as
rather
curious
in
spots
the
vine
on
your
balcony
was
withered
on
my
seized
with
a
wild
suspicion
lilly
stepped
a
pace
nearer
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
and
clutching
her
arm
asked
what
has
my
balcony
to
do
with
von
prell
miss
anna
miss
von
schwertfeger
avoided
lilly
look
calm
yourself
my
dear
she
said
calm
yourself
persons
in
my
position
have
to
keep
their
eyes
wide
open
that
what
they
are
there
for
i
was
simply
acting
for
your
protection
because
anyone
who
does
not
know
you
as
i
do
might
come
to
the
vile
conclusion
that
if
a
man
climbs
up
to
your
balcony
lilly
began
to
cry
it
so
low
so
low
miss
von
schwertfeger
drew
her
to
the
sofa
and
stroked
her
brow
i
have
gone
through
much
worse
things
dear
child
at
any
rate
i
wanted
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
affair
and
although
i
need
not
say
i
had
the
least
suspicion
of
you
she
turned
her
eyes
away
again
nevertheless
i
spent
a
few
nights
outside
your
door
lilly
started
while
she
had
been
sleeping
in
innocent
unconsciousness
someone
had
lurked
in
hiding
close
by
so
fast
was
she
held
captive
and
about
one
this
morning
i
caught
him
in
the
act
fancy
the
had
the
temerity
to
lean
one
of
haberland
ladders
against
your
balcony
that
was
the
cause
of
the
broken
withered
vines
and
enter
your
sitting
room
through
the
glass
door
glass
doors
dearie
ought
never
be
left
open
he
passed
your
bedroom
and
went
to
the
corridor
without
seeing
me
of
course
since
katie
is
the
only
person
who
sleeps
on
that
side
i
charged
her
with
it
early
this
morning
she
made
no
denials
i
always
act
in
such
matters
with
the
utmost
mildness
and
reserve
and
i
told
her
she
might
give
notice
and
leave
on
the
first
but
what
shall
we
do
about
the
young
man
i
know
this
is
the
one
place
where
he
can
be
brought
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
should
the
colonel
dismiss
him
all
over
with
him
and
i
have
no
right
to
conceal
his
conduct
from
the
colonel
an
affair
that
so
nearly
compromises
his
wife
honour
what
has
my
honour
to
do
with
von
prell
if
he
runs
after
servant
girls
lilly
ventured
to
interject
hoping
to
improve
his
prospects
a
bit
by
playing
the
innocent
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
just
time
enough
to
enlighten
her
innocence
concerning
all
the
evil
results
of
von
prell
mad
conduct
when
the
table
began
to
quiver
from
the
colonel
tread
as
he
came
tramping
down
the
corridor
do
say
anything
not
yet
begged
lilly
and
with
that
was
hanging
on
the
colonel
neck
to
hide
her
confusion
the
colonel
noticed
nothing
amiss
his
suspicions
ever
alert
had
gone
to
sleep
now
that
he
knew
his
young
wife
secure
under
the
argus
eyes
of
his
old
and
tried
housekeeper
he
was
no
longer
that
greedy
lover
simulating
youthfulness
who
had
spied
upon
her
every
look
and
emotion
jealous
of
his
mastery
the
humourous
condescension
with
which
he
watched
the
doings
of
the
lovely
gentle
child
gave
him
a
natural
semblance
of
fatherliness
which
became
him
well
his
visits
to
the
club
house
in
the
garrison
town
nearby
at
first
only
occasional
had
begun
to
grow
more
frequent
sometimes
he
even
departed
from
his
custom
of
leaving
after
supper
and
took
the
afternoon
train
but
whatever
time
he
left
he
never
returned
before
two
in
the
morning
since
there
was
no
train
to
bring
him
back
earlier
during
breakfast
he
explained
to
the
ladies
that
he
would
have
to
go
to
town
that
day
to
unload
the
barley
crop
on
the
jews
an
idea
occurred
to
lilly
which
filled
her
soul
with
sacred
joy
the
colonel
absence
must
be
employed
for
rescuing
von
prell
how
she
did
not
yet
know
but
save
him
she
must
she
was
the
only
one
to
do
it
if
she
did
not
concern
herself
in
his
behalf
who
else
was
there
in
the
wide
world
to
tow
his
drifting
vessel
to
security
after
the
colonel
had
left
the
room
she
plucked
up
the
courage
to
put
in
a
plea
with
miss
von
schwertfeger
who
however
refused
to
relent
on
the
next
occasion
he
will
do
even
worse
things
she
said
then
the
shame
both
for
him
and
for
us
will
be
still
greater
no
he
wo
do
anything
worse
lilly
averred
he
will
get
better
you
need
only
take
him
to
task
i
old
enough
to
replied
miss
von
schwertfeger
with
a
smile
and
i
possess
the
authority
but
to
be
quite
frank
the
subject
is
rather
a
delicate
one
and
i
should
like
nevermore
to
have
a
thing
to
do
with
such
sordid
affairs
the
extinct
eyes
over
which
the
lids
lay
like
heavy
blankets
fell
into
a
fixed
stare
which
lilly
had
frequently
noticed
it
seemed
to
bring
to
the
top
an
old
dark
bitter
hatred
which
had
long
lain
buried
then
miss
von
schwertfeger
herself
returned
to
the
subject
all
i
can
agree
to
she
said
is
that
if
he
comes
to
me
of
his
own
will
and
begs
my
pardon
maybe
i
will
yield
that
all
i
can
do
without
incurring
the
blame
of
being
underhanded
why
he
does
even
suspect
he
been
discovered
i
should
like
to
wager
rejoined
miss
von
schwertfeger
that
katie
will
use
her
first
free
moment
to
run
over
to
him
and
if
she
does
cried
lilly
scarcely
mastering
her
anxiety
miss
von
schwertfeger
took
her
head
between
her
hands
if
i
did
not
know
dearie
what
a
sweet
harmless
young
creature
you
are
i
should
say
your
interest
in
the
little
rake
is
most
curious
now
you
need
blush
i
know
there
nothing
back
of
it
at
all
events
i
will
wait
until
because
you
plead
for
him
my
love
thus
the
conversation
ended
nothing
more
was
to
be
expected
of
miss
von
schwertfeger
if
i
do
save
him
he
will
be
driven
away
and
if
he
driven
away
he
go
to
rack
and
ruin
and
if
he
goes
to
rack
and
ruin
i
shall
be
to
blame
in
this
fashion
lilly
thoughts
kept
revolving
dizzily
in
her
brain
the
simplest
thing
would
be
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
katie
but
that
was
unbefitting
lilly
station
besides
it
had
not
occurred
to
the
poor
girl
who
crept
about
apathetically
to
run
over
to
see
von
prell
later
in
the
day
in
fact
she
got
an
attack
of
cramps
and
had
to
be
put
to
bed
at
four
the
colonel
drove
off
to
the
station
he
had
stuck
a
package
of
blue
banknotes
into
his
which
was
an
unfailing
sign
that
he
would
not
return
before
early
morning
evening
came
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
and
the
cracking
of
whips
proclaimed
the
end
of
the
day
work
lilly
crouched
behind
the
vine
on
her
balcony
and
listened
to
what
was
going
on
at
the
lodge
finally
the
scapegrace
appeared
at
his
dormer
window
dragging
his
little
dog
by
a
chain
he
was
wearing
the
sort
of
greenish
grey
jacket
with
innumerable
pockets
that
managers
of
estates
affect
and
each
pocket
was
stuffed
full
giving
his
figure
a
warty
appearance
nevertheless
he
was
a
dear
bright
little
fellow
well
worth
the
saving
if
she
were
to
signal
to
him
and
throw
down
a
piece
of
paper
would
it
be
possible
for
him
to
pick
it
up
later
without
being
seen
she
went
into
her
room
and
scrawled
a
few
lines
in
pencil
everything
has
been
discovered
miss
von
schwertfeger
promises
to
keep
silent
provided
you
she
stopped
short
should
the
note
fall
into
strange
hands
the
stupidest
mortal
would
construe
them
into
a
confession
of
guilt
i
will
speak
to
him
she
decided
the
supper
bell
rang
how
strangely
miss
von
schwertfeger
regarded
her
as
if
she
had
gotten
a
glimpse
into
the
depths
of
lilly
soul
and
discovered
her
bold
design
but
she
did
not
refer
to
the
malefactor
again
on
rising
from
the
table
she
put
her
arm
through
lilly
after
her
wont
when
she
intended
to
bar
the
way
to
lilly
polish
friends
she
wo
let
go
the
whole
evening
thought
lilly
raging
inwardly
in
a
short
while
however
word
was
brought
that
katie
had
grown
sicker
and
it
might
be
necessary
to
send
for
the
physician
i
be
back
directly
said
miss
von
schwertfeger
as
she
left
the
room
giving
lilly
a
look
expressive
of
stubborn
resistance
in
an
instant
lilly
had
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
was
running
down
the
terrace
steps
leading
to
the
park
profound
silence
reigned
the
only
sound
was
of
a
splashing
which
came
from
behind
a
cypress
tree
where
old
haberland
still
occupied
with
watering
the
roses
was
filling
his
cans
lilly
made
straight
for
the
lodge
considering
ways
of
making
him
look
from
his
window
and
see
her
she
was
saved
from
committing
this
indiscretion
he
was
lying
at
full
length
on
the
green
bench
outside
the
house
smoking
a
cigarette
with
evident
gusto
the
dog
chain
wrapped
about
his
left
wrist
and
the
dog
himself
asleep
at
his
feet
none
of
the
other
men
were
about
her
heart
throbbing
almost
deprived
her
of
breath
von
prell
he
jumped
to
his
feet
the
dog
along
with
him
von
prell
i
should
like
to
speak
with
you
he
put
his
hand
to
his
head
to
remove
his
cap
but
no
cap
was
there
i
am
at
my
lady
service
will
you
accompany
me
a
little
way
at
my
lady
service
he
threw
away
the
stump
of
his
cigarette
glanced
about
hastily
for
his
vanished
cap
then
walked
at
her
side
stiff
as
a
puppet
in
his
extravagant
respect
lilly
led
the
way
into
the
interior
of
the
park
where
the
clusters
of
trees
and
the
open
grassy
spaces
melted
into
darkness
she
had
gotten
back
her
calm
the
desire
to
save
him
gave
her
strength
of
which
she
had
not
deemed
herself
capable
you
must
not
misunderstand
my
coming
to
you
she
began
certainly
not
my
lady
he
replied
bowing
obsequiously
the
evening
is
so
lovely
and
old
acquaintances
like
to
chat
with
each
other
once
in
a
while
if
i
had
wanted
anything
like
that
said
lilly
making
no
effort
to
conceal
her
sense
of
insult
i
should
have
invited
you
to
the
castle
if
i
come
to
you
instead
you
can
readily
imagine
the
matter
is
more
important
what
can
be
more
important
to
me
than
strolling
here
at
my
side
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
von
prell
if
you
knew
the
difficulty
you
were
in
you
would
take
care
not
to
indulge
in
such
talk
lilly
had
never
thought
herself
capable
of
so
much
haughtiness
what
difficulty
can
i
be
in
my
lady
he
rejoined
raising
his
brows
and
wrinkling
his
forehead
my
soul
has
worn
ever
since
i
was
condemned
to
live
in
a
certain
close
distance
from
or
rather
a
certain
distant
proximity
to
my
gracious
lady
whether
tommy
and
myself
possess
the
character
for
enduring
this
trial
come
come
tommy
be
a
goose
our
lady
benefactress
will
have
no
objections
to
your
not
treading
on
her
train
tommy
obstinately
planted
his
forelegs
and
had
to
be
dragged
along
like
a
lifeless
toy
you
strangle
the
poor
little
beast
said
lilly
happy
to
have
found
a
way
of
avoiding
his
personalities
he
will
simply
be
sharing
the
sensations
of
his
master
said
von
prell
illustrating
his
reply
by
clutching
at
his
throat
and
emitting
a
horrible
gurgle
such
behaviour
must
no
longer
be
permitted
lilly
owed
it
to
herself
and
her
position
to
resent
it
von
prell
she
said
very
condescendingly
do
you
realize
that
by
the
same
time
you
will
probably
have
been
dismissed
he
was
touched
at
last
he
frowned
and
bit
the
ends
of
his
moustache
but
then
he
said
what
gives
me
some
satisfaction
in
the
fact
is
that
my
lady
seems
to
take
no
slight
interest
in
the
matter
now
she
became
angry
in
earnest
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
von
prell
she
cried
i
wear
myself
out
and
take
great
risks
trying
to
help
you
and
you
show
your
gratitude
by
making
silly
remarks
all
the
time
courage
tommy
he
said
taking
the
dog
in
his
arms
first
they
flay
us
then
they
kick
us
out
our
one
comfort
is
we
are
innocent
sufferers
poor
poor
tommy
do
try
to
whitewash
yourself
lilly
reprimanded
miss
von
schwertfeger
discovered
everything
your
relations
you
understand
your
nightly
trips
to
my
balcony
and
through
my
room
everything
do
you
think
i
take
pleasure
in
having
to
treat
you
like
a
criminal
when
always
thought
so
much
of
you
do
you
think
i
much
rather
be
proud
of
you
than
stand
here
and
see
you
driven
away
like
a
stray
dog
or
can
you
say
anything
in
justification
of
yourself
can
you
tell
me
she
talked
herself
into
such
warmth
that
she
forgot
the
unseemliness
of
her
being
there
with
him
she
was
now
that
which
she
wanted
to
be
the
benevolent
chatelaine
who
turns
everything
to
good
account
and
her
breast
swelled
with
the
consciousness
of
her
lofty
ethical
undertaking
they
had
stepped
from
under
the
dark
arches
of
the
linden
walk
a
few
sharply
defined
streaks
of
red
still
coloured
the
west
and
cast
a
deep
glow
over
his
narrow
freckled
face
he
looked
completely
crushed
and
penitent
and
lilly
regretted
having
dealt
with
him
so
harshly
i
realise
he
began
after
a
short
pause
his
voice
quivering
as
with
suppressed
excitement
i
realise
i
must
not
let
so
grave
a
charge
go
without
justifying
myself
and
i
can
justify
myself
i
most
undoubtedly
can
but
in
doing
so
i
am
compelled
to
disclose
a
secret
which
i
really
do
not
know
if
i
ought
to
initiate
you
into
the
horrible
mysteries
that
threaten
to
ruin
my
life
what
are
they
queried
lilly
in
terrified
curiosity
well
then
from
my
boyhood
up
i
have
been
pursued
by
an
awful
fate
which
comes
upon
me
when
i
am
utterly
defenceless
and
imposes
upon
me
responsibility
for
misdeeds
of
which
i
am
absolutely
innocent
and
places
me
in
breakneck
situations
which
i
will
be
outspoken
i
am
well
i
am
a
somnambulist
the
merry
little
devils
frolicked
between
his
silvery
lids
and
lilly
in
spite
of
herself
burst
out
laughing
he
joined
in
with
his
dear
mute
tehee
which
shook
him
like
a
storm
and
they
stood
there
laughing
till
they
wearied
lilly
no
longer
thought
of
her
chatelaine
dignity
or
her
ethical
mission
as
if
by
mutual
agreement
they
turned
into
the
deserted
depths
of
the
park
which
bordered
on
a
bosky
beech
grove
with
neither
fence
nor
hedge
between
it
grew
darker
at
each
step
tommy
resigning
himself
to
his
fate
trotted
behind
his
master
obediently
well
said
von
prell
after
they
had
recovered
from
their
laugh
why
should
i
try
to
throw
dust
in
your
eyes
i
am
a
poor
pickerel
floundering
here
on
dry
land
have
you
the
faintest
notion
of
what
it
means
to
keep
company
with
three
plebeians
and
lead
a
useful
vegetable
existence
and
from
morning
till
evening
steadfastly
practise
dutifulness
and
uprightness
it
more
than
a
fellow
can
stomach
i
tell
you
it
enough
to
drive
him
to
a
dose
of
castor
oil
tommy
helps
me
tide
over
the
worst
moments
but
every
now
and
then
he
too
is
a
disappointment
to
me
will
my
lady
permit
me
to
use
this
occasion
for
asking
her
an
extremely
important
question
pleased
at
his
having
grown
serious
lilly
assented
can
you
can
you
wag
your
ears
she
succumbed
to
another
paroxysm
of
laughter
as
to
a
spell
of
sickness
leaning
against
a
tree
and
panting
for
breath
while
he
continued
with
profound
affliction
in
his
voice
i
am
master
of
the
modest
art
and
have
been
proud
to
exercise
my
skill
ever
since
i
was
at
high
school
where
it
was
considered
the
acme
of
human
accomplishments
i
made
up
my
mind
to
train
tommy
to
do
the
same
trick
and
i
spent
many
an
hour
over
him
in
difficult
intellectual
effort
but
without
result
one
day
however
i
discovered
he
could
wag
his
ears
much
better
than
i
can
and
i
assume
always
had
been
able
to
only
he
did
it
when
he
wanted
to
not
when
i
wanted
him
to
is
that
distressing
does
it
reflect
the
general
aimlessness
of
human
endeavour
o
dearest
baronissima
i
am
afraid
i
shall
soon
become
a
great
philosopher
out
of
sheer
boredom
lilly
could
now
see
only
the
outline
of
his
figure
behind
which
the
dog
eyes
glowed
like
two
beacon
lights
since
her
school
days
she
had
not
abandoned
herself
so
completely
to
a
spirit
of
pure
fun
and
she
had
to
wait
until
a
pause
came
in
her
laughing
before
she
could
tell
him
it
was
high
time
to
be
returning
he
obediently
turned
on
his
heels
transferring
tommy
chain
from
one
hand
to
the
other
the
catastrophe
that
menaced
him
seemed
to
have
passed
from
his
mind
lilly
therefore
since
time
pressed
and
something
had
to
be
done
for
him
took
the
bit
between
her
teeth
and
reported
what
miss
von
schwertfeger
intended
to
do
and
what
she
demanded
from
him
as
the
price
of
her
silence
lilly
was
helping
him
but
not
with
that
beautiful
dignified
air
of
superiority
with
which
she
had
wanted
to
hold
out
her
rescuing
hand
she
felt
she
was
like
a
playmate
of
his
and
every
few
moments
a
giggle
interrupted
her
speech
the
worthy
dame
has
an
unconquerable
desire
to
stand
about
on
toes
said
von
prell
but
since
we
gotten
ourselves
into
a
scrape
my
dear
little
tommy
we
have
to
juggle
to
get
ourselves
out
of
it
thank
you
very
much
my
lady
in
accordance
with
your
instructions
i
will
go
to
her
and
ask
her
to
forgive
me
before
going
i
oil
my
speaking
apparatus
i
will
be
more
than
repentant
i
will
even
be
roguish
that
works
on
respectable
old
maids
like
spanish
fly
and
i
will
use
the
opportunity
to
the
best
advantage
for
our
future
intercourse
with
each
other
provided
of
course
my
young
queen
agrees
oh
she
agreed
fully
but
how
will
you
do
it
she
asked
fearfully
leave
the
matter
to
me
he
replied
your
duenna
is
a
knowing
old
beast
but
i
am
even
more
knowing
i
should
be
surprised
if
i
did
earn
an
occasional
supper
in
the
castle
at
which
i
shall
have
the
opportunity
of
looking
into
the
eyes
of
my
exalted
mistress
without
being
observed
by
the
two
high
mightinesses
there
were
several
things
in
his
speech
that
grated
on
lilly
he
might
make
merry
as
much
as
he
pleased
at
miss
von
schwertfeger
expense
but
the
colonel
stood
on
too
high
a
plane
to
be
the
butt
of
his
ridicule
and
now
that
von
prell
was
out
of
danger
it
occurred
to
lilly
for
the
first
time
how
detestable
his
conduct
had
been
and
how
lacking
in
character
she
was
to
be
sauntering
about
with
him
in
the
dark
laughing
at
his
sallies
one
moment
von
prell
she
said
i
warned
you
of
the
danger
you
were
in
because
i
thought
i
owed
it
to
our
former
friendship
but
now
that
i
have
told
you
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
each
other
my
time
is
up
good
evening
von
prell
with
that
she
hurried
on
ahead
along
the
obscure
wood
path
and
gave
no
look
around
suddenly
she
felt
something
soft
and
warm
and
living
slip
between
her
feet
she
screamed
and
turned
about
for
von
prell
help
at
the
same
instant
a
chain
wound
itself
about
her
ankle
and
held
her
fast
since
she
and
von
prell
had
turned
back
the
dog
in
his
eagerness
to
get
home
had
been
straining
on
the
chain
with
all
his
might
and
had
taken
her
hastening
off
as
a
signal
to
break
away
thus
entangling
himself
in
her
dress
the
more
he
tugged
the
more
painfully
the
chain
cut
into
her
flesh
that
made
an
end
of
lilly
ire
von
prell
had
to
kneel
and
hold
down
the
unruly
little
animal
while
he
unwound
the
chain
from
her
ankle
tommy
tommy
what
have
we
done
we
have
grievously
hurt
our
noble
mistress
we
ca
be
blamed
for
pulling
at
our
chains
but
if
in
doing
so
we
get
under
people
skirts
we
give
great
offence
shame
on
you
you
rascal
he
planted
a
kiss
on
the
dog
pointed
little
snout
does
he
ever
bite
asked
lilly
with
interest
he
has
had
the
benefit
of
a
rigorous
military
training
as
a
result
of
which
he
has
grown
accustomed
to
kisses
another
burst
of
gaiety
von
prell
held
the
struggling
little
ball
of
wool
up
to
lilly
and
asked
whether
she
would
like
to
try
a
kiss
too
laughing
she
declined
and
laughing
she
went
home
with
him
characterless
as
she
was
still
laughing
aloud
she
entered
the
lighted
hall
of
the
castle
where
miss
von
schwertfeger
met
her
with
great
reproachful
eyes
where
have
you
been
my
dear
she
asked
evidently
prepared
to
meet
the
grave
situation
in
a
mild
spirit
while
subjecting
lilly
none
the
less
to
a
keen
he
so
funny
lilly
sang
out
hiding
her
face
red
with
laughter
on
miss
von
schwertfeger
shoulder
did
you
of
course
i
did
do
you
suppose
i
leave
such
a
delightful
jolly
old
friend
of
mine
in
the
lurch
miss
von
schwertfeger
face
became
rigid
lilly
gave
herself
a
little
shake
and
uttered
a
joyous
gurgle
then
she
ran
off
to
her
room
undressed
and
burying
her
head
in
the
pillows
laughed
herself
to
sleep
chapter
xviii
in
laughter
it
began
and
in
laughter
continued
when
lilly
awoke
the
next
morning
she
saw
that
everything
about
her
the
chandelier
the
washstand
and
the
pretty
sentimental
gleaner
on
the
wall
had
assumed
a
new
aspect
and
the
sun
was
shining
twice
as
brightly
she
stepped
to
the
mirror
in
her
nightgown
and
forthwith
had
to
laugh
again
at
the
reflection
she
saw
there
a
veritable
street
arab
face
with
sly
darting
eyes
and
saucy
nose
at
breakfast
she
fairly
sparkled
with
playful
conceits
chased
the
colonel
about
the
table
and
felt
a
warm
sense
of
gratitude
toward
miss
von
schwertfeger
rise
within
her
as
for
miss
von
schwertfeger
she
smiled
to
herself
significantly
and
when
the
colonel
left
the
room
caught
lilly
by
her
ears
kissed
her
on
her
forehead
and
said
you
baby
you
she
made
no
reference
to
the
confession
lilly
had
let
slip
that
she
and
von
prell
were
old
friends
in
fact
to
judge
by
her
manner
you
might
suppose
she
had
not
heard
it
lilly
ran
up
to
her
balcony
pushed
aside
the
creepers
and
sent
a
summoning
nod
to
von
prell
who
was
walking
up
and
down
uncertainly
between
the
castle
and
the
lodge
he
understood
bowed
and
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
terrace
steps
what
took
place
between
him
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
remained
a
secret
and
there
was
no
finding
out
whether
or
no
she
had
questioned
him
in
regard
to
his
former
relations
with
the
colonel
wife
but
whatever
the
doubts
on
that
score
the
success
of
his
interview
was
indisputable
so
far
from
having
to
slink
away
from
the
place
he
appeared
at
the
supper
table
that
very
same
day
ushered
in
by
the
colonel
himself
in
his
striped
coat
white
waistcoat
and
high
collar
in
which
his
face
lay
almost
buried
and
wearing
his
most
respectful
expression
he
was
the
very
embodiment
of
correctness
i
heard
said
the
colonel
leading
him
to
lilly
that
von
prell
does
feel
entirely
happy
over
there
in
the
lodge
if
you
have
no
objections
he
will
come
to
meals
oftener
after
this
lilly
had
the
slightest
objections
the
thought
however
that
katie
would
appear
in
the
doorway
the
next
instant
almost
choked
her
but
another
maid
took
katie
place
in
handing
old
ferdinand
the
dishes
lilly
gave
miss
von
schwertfeger
a
questioning
look
which
she
answered
in
a
whisper
so
as
not
to
be
overheard
by
the
gentlemen
the
poor
girl
got
very
sick
and
asked
for
a
long
leave
of
absence
most
likely
she
will
never
come
back
again
in
her
gratification
lilly
impetuously
pressed
miss
von
hand
under
the
table
she
had
a
dim
idea
that
katie
had
been
dismissed
in
order
to
spare
her
the
repugnance
of
witnessing
something
impure
the
gentlemen
without
delay
plunged
deep
into
a
discussion
of
the
cavalry
richly
interlarding
their
talk
with
proper
names
von
prell
sat
inclined
toward
the
colonel
to
take
in
the
instructions
of
his
old
commander
and
kept
blinking
his
lids
in
respectful
attention
the
colonel
dominated
like
a
wrathful
god
he
spoke
gruffly
and
noisily
and
shot
out
his
dagger
glances
as
if
to
mow
down
rank
after
rank
of
the
enemy
army
but
this
was
nothing
else
than
a
craftsman
vain
joy
in
his
work
lilly
listened
and
would
gladly
have
taken
part
in
the
conversation
but
the
men
had
forgotten
her
presence
and
a
jealous
gloom
clouded
her
spirit
for
which
she
did
not
know
whether
to
blame
the
colonel
or
von
prell
when
von
prell
rose
to
take
leave
the
colonel
laying
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
said
see
here
why
have
we
done
this
before
the
glance
he
sent
lilly
seemed
to
signify
such
an
amount
of
caution
was
really
unnecessary
when
the
first
cool
days
in
september
brought
on
the
colonel
gout
again
and
his
visits
to
town
had
to
be
postponed
indefinitely
von
prell
invitations
to
supper
grew
more
frequent
the
colonel
groaned
and
cursed
each
time
he
mounted
a
horse
though
he
refused
to
listen
to
lilly
when
she
pled
with
him
to
give
up
his
morning
gallop
too
bad
all
of
you
are
always
so
dreadfully
concerned
about
me
she
observed
because
sometimes
i
might
take
your
place
in
riding
about
the
country
the
colonel
and
his
housekeeper
exchanged
looks
after
all
it
a
shame
she
ca
ride
horseback
any
decent
sort
of
a
riding
master
might
take
her
in
hand
my
morning
excursion
is
more
than
enough
for
me
what
do
you
think
anna
can
we
entrust
her
to
that
humbug
von
prell
lilly
face
lighted
up
with
joy
miss
von
schwertfeger
let
her
eyes
rest
on
her
glowing
cheeks
and
said
very
slowly
as
if
to
chew
the
cud
of
every
word
you
know
von
prell
is
reckless
what
if
he
should
bring
our
darling
back
to
us
some
day
with
broken
bones
at
all
events
it
seems
to
me
before
deciding
we
had
better
consider
the
matter
carefully
though
lilly
took
good
care
not
to
utter
a
syllable
expressive
of
desire
or
opposition
she
was
not
successful
apparently
in
concealing
her
secret
wishes
for
the
next
time
they
were
alone
together
miss
von
schwertfeger
suddenly
took
lilly
face
between
her
hands
and
said
get
rid
of
the
idea
darling
do
believe
me
it
better
so
about
this
time
lilly
made
a
remarkable
and
somewhat
suspicious
find
she
enjoyed
going
on
expeditions
of
discovery
through
the
spacious
castle
only
part
of
which
was
inhabited
and
on
one
occasion
while
rummaging
about
in
one
of
the
guest
rooms
now
seldom
used
she
extracted
from
a
chiffonier
a
light
gauze
shirt
covered
with
silver
spangles
and
shot
with
silver
thread
resembling
the
shirt
she
had
often
had
to
wear
during
the
dresden
stay
before
going
to
bed
her
own
shirt
these
days
hung
undisturbed
in
her
closet
from
which
it
had
not
been
removed
even
for
miss
von
schwertfeger
inspection
because
lilly
was
a
little
ashamed
of
it
her
curiosity
was
piqued
by
the
vestment
she
had
found
and
folding
it
carefully
she
went
down
to
question
her
friend
about
it
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
sitting
over
her
account
books
and
scarcely
looked
up
when
lilly
entered
but
suddenly
the
gleam
of
the
tinsel
in
the
sunlight
attracted
her
attention
a
quiver
ran
through
her
body
her
eyes
widened
her
figure
stiffened
as
if
she
were
looking
at
a
ghost
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
laughed
lilly
i
thought
i
had
cleared
up
thoroughly
she
said
shaking
herself
she
snatched
the
garment
from
lilly
hand
wrapped
it
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
and
carried
it
to
the
kitchen
followed
by
lilly
who
saw
a
whirl
of
smoke
carry
bits
of
silver
thread
up
the
hearth
chimney
old
maggie
stood
by
looking
in
bewilderment
from
one
to
the
other
she
seemed
to
know
what
the
discovery
involved
but
later
when
lilly
tried
to
extract
information
from
her
she
had
lost
her
faculty
of
speech
i
did
always
use
to
be
just
where
the
colonel
was
she
stuttered
ask
miss
von
schwertfeger
she
knows
she
tell
you
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
would
not
tell
she
went
about
with
compressed
lips
gave
short
answers
when
spoken
to
and
kept
her
extinct
eyes
fastened
upon
empty
space
one
evening
at
supper
her
demeanour
apparently
from
no
external
cause
underwent
a
sudden
change
she
laughed
chatted
was
tender
to
lilly
and
attentive
to
her
master
pitying
him
on
account
of
his
pain
suggesting
new
remedies
and
obtaining
his
promise
to
give
up
his
morning
ride
by
the
way
she
went
on
as
to
lilly
taking
riding
lessons
thought
it
over
carefully
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
we
are
present
at
first
at
least
we
may
entrust
her
to
the
young
man
lilly
fetched
a
deep
sigh
of
joy
but
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
could
not
have
detected
the
trace
of
a
smile
on
her
face
the
faintest
glimmer
of
delight
so
well
had
she
learned
to
keep
herself
under
control
the
next
morning
the
riding
lessons
began
with
the
colonel
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
of
course
in
attendance
walter
von
prell
appeared
in
riding
boots
and
a
jockey
cap
the
forward
inclination
of
the
upper
part
of
his
body
seemed
to
signify
i
am
awaiting
orders
and
his
respectfulness
and
obsequiousness
kept
him
shifting
from
one
foot
to
the
other
for
the
first
essay
they
had
chosen
a
lamblike
grey
mare
and
somewhat
overtrained
in
the
yet
a
smart
animal
von
prell
proceeded
very
methodically
to
explain
the
construction
of
the
saddle
and
bridle
showed
lilly
how
the
girths
are
buckled
how
the
snaffle
and
curb
rein
have
to
lie
and
how
to
keep
the
curb
chain
from
choking
the
horse
next
came
learning
how
to
mount
when
lilly
for
the
first
time
put
her
foot
on
his
interlaced
fingers
she
felt
a
warm
thrill
to
the
very
back
of
her
neck
as
if
this
contact
with
him
were
a
sign
of
secret
understanding
between
them
one
two
three
he
counted
and
there
she
was
in
the
saddle
the
colonel
clapped
his
hands
in
approval
and
walter
von
prell
blushed
with
pride
to
the
roots
of
his
blond
hair
from
now
on
he
had
the
game
in
his
hands
who
have
thought
that
blusterer
has
such
a
lot
of
pedantry
in
his
said
the
colonel
turning
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
who
nodded
silently
and
took
a
deep
breath
as
if
something
were
oppressing
her
by
the
time
lilly
was
ready
to
dismount
she
had
learned
how
to
draw
in
the
reins
and
slacken
them
and
to
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
and
she
had
even
ventured
a
trot
about
the
yard
in
short
as
the
colonel
remarked
she
was
on
the
road
to
becoming
the
most
dashing
horsewoman
in
the
army
the
lessons
followed
in
quick
succession
either
miss
von
schwertfeger
or
the
colonel
was
always
present
and
there
was
no
opportunity
for
private
conversation
between
lilly
and
von
prell
von
prell
maintained
his
stiff
abject
obsequiousness
while
lilly
burned
with
the
desire
to
see
his
waggery
flash
up
in
a
look
or
word
intelligible
to
her
alone
one
day
it
chanced
both
guards
were
absent
the
colonel
was
busied
with
the
construction
of
a
in
which
his
gout
might
defy
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
nowhere
to
be
found
lilly
heart
beat
violently
when
she
met
her
friend
and
the
smile
with
which
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
expressed
uneasy
triumph
he
responded
with
a
sly
thrust
of
his
tongue
in
the
direction
of
the
terrace
where
her
honour
was
wont
to
stand
she
could
be
found
anywhere
whispered
lilly
will
we
do
he
moaned
wringing
his
hands
why
without
the
worthy
dame
protection
we
sha
even
be
able
to
mount
deep
blue
heavens
arched
above
a
cool
breeze
heavy
with
the
smell
of
freshly
turned
soil
blew
across
the
courtyard
he
pointed
with
a
wily
look
to
the
open
gate
she
laughed
and
nodded
assent
the
next
minute
she
was
galloping
at
his
side
along
the
grassy
wood
path
where
no
argus
eyes
could
follow
her
in
utter
abandon
inwardly
exulting
and
eagerly
expectant
of
mad
pranks
to
be
played
von
prell
for
his
part
seemed
indisposed
to
avail
himself
of
his
unhoped
for
liberty
he
held
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
road
in
front
every
now
and
then
caught
at
her
reins
regulated
the
length
of
the
stirrup
and
made
her
sit
better
in
the
saddle
he
was
the
riding
master
nothing
else
how
tommy
she
asked
at
length
bored
tommy
sends
his
regards
he
replied
without
removing
his
gaze
from
the
road
and
says
we
better
pay
attention
to
nothing
but
the
horses
because
if
something
should
happen
we
never
be
allowed
to
go
out
again
and
i
send
my
regards
to
tommy
and
tell
him
he
a
goose
i
will
without
fail
he
rejoined
and
nodded
his
riding
crop
they
now
entered
a
grove
of
birch
trees
where
the
ground
was
somewhat
boggy
and
demanded
added
attention
but
lilly
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
silvery
gleam
of
the
trunks
and
the
golden
webs
which
quivered
in
the
wind
and
floated
down
on
her
cheeks
oh
see
how
beautiful
she
said
with
a
blissful
sigh
walk
your
horse
please
a
demon
took
possession
of
lilly
touching
her
horse
with
her
crop
she
went
off
in
a
mad
gallop
that
was
contrary
to
all
the
rules
and
regulations
of
horseback
riding
the
next
instant
however
von
prell
was
at
her
side
gripping
her
reins
and
pulling
up
both
horses
they
looked
at
each
other
with
flashing
eyes
lilly
felt
she
had
to
throw
herself
over
toward
him
just
to
be
nearer
to
him
say
lilly
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
hissed
she
started
and
showed
her
white
teeth
say
walter
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
retorted
they
turned
the
horses
heads
and
rode
back
home
slowly
in
silence
without
looking
at
each
other
chapter
xix
the
threshing
machine
had
been
singing
its
autumn
song
for
many
a
day
its
monotonous
whirr
could
be
heard
far
beyond
the
castle
court
it
carried
no
message
of
golden
blessings
or
glowing
crystallised
sunlight
from
morning
till
late
at
night
it
moaned
and
howled
like
an
æolian
harp
in
stormbeaten
branches
and
sometimes
soft
cries
burst
from
its
entrails
as
if
the
sheaves
it
was
torturing
and
tearing
had
been
endowed
with
speech
so
much
dreamy
bliss
dwelt
again
in
lilly
soul
that
she
got
nothing
but
allurement
and
yearning
from
this
music
which
entirely
obsessed
her
in
her
morning
slumber
and
kept
her
lying
in
bed
a
long
time
in
a
drowsy
the
better
to
listen
to
its
even
unvarying
singsong
all
the
while
she
thought
of
him
a
comrade
a
playmate
that
was
what
she
had
needed
all
along
some
one
in
whose
company
to
make
merry
and
complain
some
one
who
would
confess
all
his
follies
his
most
secret
sins
and
then
receive
laughing
absolution
for
whatever
his
crime
he
was
not
the
guilty
one
his
youth
was
the
sinner
the
same
sweet
mischievous
youth
which
filled
her
soul
with
melancholy
and
her
body
with
shuddering
which
dominated
them
both
like
a
beneficent
yet
tormenting
divinity
who
favoured
the
one
and
ruined
the
other
he
had
to
be
saved
saved
from
his
own
frivolity
from
that
fatal
condition
of
his
soul
which
threatened
to
entangle
and
choke
him
in
a
net
of
vulgar
escapades
rumours
of
the
low
life
he
was
leading
kept
cropping
up
not
to
be
silenced
and
she
needed
but
to
step
inside
the
servants
hall
for
a
stream
of
gossip
to
come
gushing
over
her
like
a
jet
of
dirty
water
her
first
intervention
was
to
be
only
the
beginning
of
the
great
mission
she
had
to
perform
in
his
life
she
would
be
his
good
genius
walking
before
him
and
holding
up
her
hands
against
every
evil
temptation
until
he
had
become
as
pure
as
undesirous
as
herself
thus
she
dreamed
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
threshing
machine
the
first
ride
beyond
the
castle
gates
though
taken
without
permission
had
been
approved
even
commended
and
others
were
to
follow
but
lilly
hesitated
she
wanted
to
learn
a
decent
canter
she
said
before
venturing
upon
new
roads
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
burning
with
eagerness
for
another
such
hour
in
von
prell
company
and
merely
lacked
the
courage
to
bring
it
about
the
morning
after
that
first
ride
he
was
the
same
cringing
riding
master
as
before
outdoing
himself
in
respectfulness
and
while
rigorous
in
imparting
instruction
lilly
had
fully
expected
he
would
whisper
a
familiar
word
hinting
at
the
day
before
a
soft
lilly
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
but
nothing
of
the
sort
took
place
the
next
few
lessons
went
in
the
same
fashion
neither
lilly
nor
von
prell
thought
of
leaving
the
courtyard
but
one
day
the
decree
went
forth
from
the
colonel
himself
enough
of
this
hopping
about
on
the
gravel
get
out
of
here
and
air
yourselves
in
the
wind
of
the
fields
at
your
command
colonel
said
von
prell
touching
his
cap
he
rode
his
horse
up
to
lilly
and
gently
steered
both
of
them
out
of
the
gate
her
heart
stood
still
she
forgot
to
say
to
the
colonel
she
was
so
preoccupied
with
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
in
store
for
her
they
went
the
same
road
that
had
brought
her
the
great
experience
of
the
week
before
the
willows
dripped
with
dew
and
at
the
slightest
touch
showered
down
a
rain
of
drops
lilly
laughed
and
shook
herself
instead
of
joining
in
he
guided
his
horse
to
the
edge
of
the
road
leaving
the
middle
to
her
but
i
to
get
wet
she
said
as
my
lady
says
he
replied
stiff
as
a
poker
in
his
stupid
artificial
respect
then
they
rode
on
in
silence
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
great
event
had
occurred
which
gave
the
lie
to
his
present
behaviour
she
ventured
to
send
him
a
furtive
sidelong
glance
but
he
did
not
respond
seeming
not
to
have
noticed
her
look
his
jockey
cap
pulled
close
over
his
head
down
to
the
back
of
his
neck
his
thin
face
sprinkled
with
dewdrops
his
boyish
body
all
muscle
and
bone
he
sat
on
his
saddle
as
if
he
and
his
horse
were
one
how
i
love
him
in
spite
of
everything
the
dear
little
fellow
she
thought
and
pictured
to
herself
how
horribly
abandoned
she
would
feel
if
ever
he
were
to
leave
the
place
and
it
became
clear
as
day
to
her
that
the
gay
excitement
in
her
soul
the
sense
of
abundance
in
her
life
here
where
she
dwelt
had
arisen
from
nothing
else
than
his
always
always
being
near
by
they
rode
along
at
an
even
gait
the
brown
ridges
bordering
the
opposite
bank
of
the
stream
drew
nearer
and
nearer
von
prell
seemed
to
be
making
for
them
but
this
did
not
serve
her
purpose
because
the
hour
for
a
frank
talk
had
struck
or
never
she
made
a
great
effort
to
go
over
in
her
mind
what
she
would
say
to
him
but
her
thoughts
were
incoherent
she
had
to
keep
her
attention
fixed
on
the
horse
and
so
long
as
she
remained
in
the
saddle
she
felt
herself
too
much
under
von
prell
control
summoning
all
her
courage
she
asked
ca
we
dismount
he
paused
to
consider
but
she
had
jumped
from
her
horse
already
and
he
had
just
time
enough
to
grasp
the
mare
snaffle
he
reprimanded
her
though
in
the
end
he
had
to
yield
they
walked
side
by
side
von
prell
leading
both
horses
the
path
led
through
a
stone
pit
sparsely
grown
with
oak
trees
and
alders
golden
marigold
buttons
dotted
the
marshy
spots
and
the
stretched
out
its
bristly
fruit
on
crinkled
arms
reddish
dock
raised
its
aging
stalk
and
the
floating
grass
was
drawing
in
its
blades
in
expectation
of
approaching
autumn
a
felled
by
a
storm
stretched
diagonally
from
the
side
of
the
road
across
the
ditch
its
purplish
red
clusters
of
berries
glowed
like
flames
which
by
right
should
have
been
extinguished
long
ago
but
which
a
mysterious
kept
feeding
i
like
to
sit
here
said
lilly
he
bowed
if
you
please
but
you
must
sit
down
too
i
must
hold
the
horses
my
lady
you
can
tie
them
to
a
tree
he
considered
a
while
i
can
he
said
and
tied
the
reins
about
the
stump
of
the
fallen
tree
when
he
was
about
to
sit
down
next
to
her
she
moved
nearer
to
the
middle
of
the
trunk
to
make
room
for
him
and
she
sat
with
her
feet
dangling
over
the
ditch
water
he
shoved
himself
after
her
swinging
his
upper
body
between
his
arms
which
held
him
like
props
no
further
she
said
she
did
not
want
him
too
close
to
her
at
my
lady
service
he
answered
and
kicked
his
heels
the
grotesque
stiffness
of
his
speech
annoyed
her
do
you
know
a
better
way
of
addressing
me
when
we
are
alone
she
asked
looking
him
full
in
the
face
i
do
but
i
must
and
last
time
how
about
then
it
happened
to
be
my
birthday
he
replied
and
i
wanted
a
pretty
gift
so
i
presented
that
to
myself
and
my
birthday
she
laughed
what
will
you
present
me
with
whatever
my
lady
wishes
call
me
comrade
once
or
always
always
just
comrade
or
be
comrade
too
be
be
be
she
cried
the
being
is
the
chief
thing
agreed
he
said
cautiously
sliding
his
right
hand
along
the
swaying
trunk
agreed
she
said
and
they
shook
hands
on
it
there
something
else
to
be
passed
upon
in
connection
with
this
he
observed
and
cleared
his
throat
what
that
is
this
comradeship
to
be
accompanied
or
not
to
be
accompanied
by
the
use
of
the
first
name
not
rejoined
lilly
thinking
she
had
made
a
great
sacrifice
he
took
the
prohibition
at
its
face
value
and
said
obediently
as
my
comrade
wishes
now
her
time
had
come
lilly
drew
in
a
deep
breath
and
said
i
have
something
very
serious
to
say
to
you
mr
von
prell
he
seemed
to
suspect
evil
ouch
he
said
and
bit
his
gloved
thumb
lilly
began
she
would
say
absolutely
nothing
about
that
affair
with
katie
even
though
it
was
very
dreadful
because
what
is
to
be
forgiven
must
also
be
forgotten
but
if
he
thought
the
life
he
had
been
leading
ever
since
he
had
come
to
lischnitz
had
remained
a
secret
he
was
greatly
mistaken
even
the
scrubbing
women
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
but
he
could
expect
anything
else
if
he
and
she
recounted
the
list
of
his
sins
which
in
spite
of
herself
had
reached
her
ears
from
the
servants
hall
lilly
was
ashamed
of
what
she
said
she
had
meant
to
speak
of
entirely
different
things
of
the
loftiness
of
human
existence
of
the
greatness
of
of
keeping
oneself
pure
for
the
sake
of
genuine
feelings
of
the
mysterious
spiritual
union
of
the
elect
on
earth
and
much
more
in
the
same
strain
but
when
she
saw
him
as
he
sat
there
with
his
back
curved
and
his
feet
turned
inward
causing
bulbs
to
appear
and
disappear
on
the
soft
leather
of
his
riding
boots
where
they
covered
his
big
toes
nothing
better
occurred
to
her
he
did
not
interrupt
her
when
she
had
concluded
he
maintained
silence
and
occupied
himself
with
following
the
movements
of
an
insect
which
was
wriggling
in
the
dark
slimy
water
of
the
ditch
have
you
nothing
to
say
she
asked
after
i
have
reproached
you
with
such
disgraceful
behaviour
what
should
i
have
to
say
he
asked
in
turn
my
one
claim
to
celebrity
is
my
being
a
man
utterly
devoid
of
moral
fibre
should
i
lose
that
one
claim
too
if
you
have
nothing
within
yourself
to
hold
you
up
lean
on
me
she
cried
glowing
with
eagerness
let
me
be
your
friend
your
adviser
your
he
suggested
and
swished
about
the
slime
with
his
crop
she
realised
that
everything
she
said
was
lost
on
him
that
he
even
seized
whatever
opportunity
offered
to
make
merry
at
her
expense
please
get
up
and
let
me
by
she
said
why
should
i
cast
what
is
best
in
me
before
one
who
is
unworthy
he
made
no
movement
to
leave
his
seat
look
comrade
he
said
pointing
to
the
dark
surface
of
the
water
a
water
spider
is
gliding
about
there
all
the
time
with
its
legs
up
and
its
head
down
if
you
were
to
ask
it
why
it
would
say
it
does
know
how
to
glide
differently
that
its
nature
what
to
be
done
a
man
can
restrain
himself
she
cried
flaring
up
and
casting
indignant
glances
at
him
a
man
can
look
up
to
heights
to
an
ideal
he
can
listen
to
the
advice
of
a
friend
who
means
well
by
him
that
what
he
can
do
and
what
does
his
friend
advise
he
asked
flatteringly
while
swinging
himself
nearer
but
this
time
she
did
not
answer
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
cried
cried
so
that
her
body
shook
with
sobs
for
god
sake
sit
still
he
exclaimed
stretching
his
arms
about
her
in
a
wide
circle
for
she
was
in
danger
of
losing
her
balance
on
the
slim
swaying
trunk
of
the
do
sit
still
lilly
else
you
fall
into
the
water
she
shuddered
she
heard
nothing
of
what
he
said
except
that
sweet
secret
criminal
lilly
for
which
she
had
been
longing
the
whole
week
then
he
promised
her
everything
she
wanted
of
him
he
would
run
after
any
more
servant
girls
he
would
spend
nights
boozing
with
the
inspector
and
the
bookkeeper
he
would
oh
what
would
he
do
if
only
she
stopped
crying
your
word
of
honour
she
said
raising
her
wet
reddened
eyes
my
word
of
honour
he
replied
without
an
instant
hesitation
she
smiled
at
him
happy
and
grateful
you
wo
regret
it
she
said
i
be
close
at
hand
i
be
your
friend
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
and
whatever
the
two
high
mightinesses
permit
he
added
this
time
the
epithet
high
mightinesses
did
not
annoy
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
oh
they
yes
of
course
then
they
both
laughed
till
they
came
near
falling
into
the
ditch
after
all
chapter
xx
delightful
times
followed
a
game
of
with
herself
a
draught
from
an
unfailing
fount
of
expectancy
anticipation
delicious
aftertaste
and
joyous
recollections
each
day
brought
new
pleasures
and
untold
wealth
sometimes
when
lilly
threw
open
the
shutters
in
the
morning
and
the
fresh
red
september
air
flowed
in
over
her
she
felt
as
if
god
had
spread
a
mantle
of
sunny
gold
over
the
heavens
to
wrap
both
of
them
in
so
snug
and
close
that
the
whole
world
disappeared
leaving
no
one
but
themselves
behind
pressed
against
each
other
in
laughter
and
drunk
with
all
that
light
she
felt
she
was
growing
more
beautiful
from
day
to
day
and
emanated
a
sort
of
radiance
which
caused
all
who
met
her
to
look
up
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
and
satisfaction
mingled
however
with
a
touch
of
melancholy
such
as
always
comes
over
us
when
we
see
a
human
being
or
a
flower
developing
too
happily
too
proudly
for
its
glory
to
endure
the
two
high
mightinesses
did
not
keep
their
eyes
closed
either
the
colonel
found
no
formula
for
such
symptoms
in
his
store
of
experiences
had
lilly
gone
about
downcast
staring
dreamily
into
space
had
she
crept
about
him
timidly
had
she
wavered
between
ardour
and
estrangement
his
suspicions
would
have
grown
lively
he
would
have
begun
to
sound
and
spy
on
her
but
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
discern
aught
else
than
increased
spiritual
in
her
pliable
blissful
tenderness
so
he
smirked
complacently
at
the
harmless
gaiety
his
young
wife
radiated
and
with
paternal
calm
accepted
the
lavish
caresses
which
served
as
an
outlet
for
her
overwrought
ecstasy
anna
von
schwertfeger
shared
no
less
benevolently
in
lilly
happiness
she
seemed
to
harbour
as
little
suspicion
as
the
colonel
that
a
third
person
was
playing
a
part
in
her
life
otherwise
she
would
scarcely
have
viewed
the
growing
frequency
with
which
the
two
young
people
met
with
such
unbegrudging
kindliness
often
after
supper
she
drew
lilly
into
the
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
she
dwelt
amid
her
account
books
a
genuine
old
maid
home
with
canary
birds
flower
pots
faded
family
photographs
and
all
sorts
of
gilt
and
china
remnants
of
past
glory
such
as
are
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
in
families
of
decayed
gentlefolk
at
other
times
she
came
gliding
into
lilly
bedroom
at
an
incredibly
late
hour
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
did
not
stir
until
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
colonel
carriage
coming
from
the
station
the
two
women
would
plunge
into
profound
conversations
concerning
life
and
death
solitary
old
age
and
overflowing
youth
the
measure
god
has
set
for
each
mortal
and
the
misfortune
of
trying
to
exceed
that
measure
anna
von
schwertfeger
no
longer
pried
or
warned
yet
her
fashion
of
hopping
from
subject
to
subject
of
heedlessly
expressing
an
opinion
the
very
reverse
of
one
she
had
uttered
a
moment
before
seemed
sufficient
reason
for
supposing
that
her
mind
was
occupied
with
very
very
different
things
often
while
her
speech
flowed
on
monotonously
lilly
would
be
astonished
to
look
up
and
find
her
eyes
resting
on
her
intently
almost
apprehensively
then
again
lilly
would
feel
herself
stroked
and
kissed
with
such
pitying
inwardliness
that
she
herself
was
touched
and
later
when
left
alone
she
began
to
feel
afraid
of
the
dark
as
if
a
menacing
fate
were
crouching
at
the
bottom
of
her
bed
ready
to
pounce
on
her
and
choke
her
but
from
where
was
misfortune
to
drop
on
her
was
she
more
securely
stowed
away
than
ever
before
in
her
life
whom
did
she
deceive
wherein
did
she
sin
even
if
the
few
little
secrets
binding
her
to
walter
should
be
discovered
how
would
she
be
punished
she
would
simply
get
a
fine
sermon
like
a
naughty
child
nothing
worse
thus
she
comforted
herself
before
the
aftertaste
of
miss
von
schwertfeger
late
visits
was
dispelled
by
new
dreams
of
happiness
september
neared
its
end
lilly
went
horseback
riding
with
von
prell
almost
every
day
or
she
met
him
at
twilight
as
if
by
chance
in
deserted
parts
of
the
park
they
would
spy
each
other
strolling
about
some
one
of
the
various
places
they
had
fixed
upon
once
for
all
then
there
was
the
to
fall
back
upon
in
case
different
arrangements
had
to
be
made
von
prell
had
brought
the
convenient
instrument
from
the
city
and
it
reposed
innocently
in
a
corner
of
lilly
balcony
to
all
appearances
nothing
more
than
a
superfluous
it
enabled
her
to
blow
whatever
message
she
wanted
through
the
foliage
on
the
balcony
directly
into
his
open
window
sometimes
it
was
only
good
morning
comrade
sometimes
the
hour
of
meeting
or
sometimes
a
harmless
jest
the
outgrowth
of
a
exuberance
on
the
evenings
the
colonel
remained
at
home
von
prell
was
usually
invited
to
supper
though
he
then
assumed
his
stiffness
the
opportunity
for
a
little
byplay
was
now
always
afforded
neither
lilly
nor
von
prell
moved
a
muscle
and
the
two
high
mightinesses
sat
there
unsuspecting
but
lilly
had
a
rival
whom
she
feared
and
detested
because
that
rival
had
the
power
to
draw
her
comrade
attention
from
her
for
hours
at
a
time
the
mere
mention
of
the
rival
name
sufficed
to
reduce
lilly
to
the
position
of
nothing
but
a
lay
figure
the
rival
was
the
regiment
the
time
of
the
autumn
manoeuvres
had
come
and
both
gentlemen
read
the
papers
with
feverish
interest
to
see
what
part
was
being
taken
by
their
former
regiment
one
evening
they
sent
off
a
picture
postal
with
congratulations
to
the
regiment
two
days
later
the
reply
came
also
on
a
postal
all
scribbled
over
with
names
which
it
required
a
vast
effort
to
decipher
three
remained
illegible
or
rather
inexplicable
until
all
of
a
sudden
walter
lit
upon
the
solution
von
holten
dehnicke
von
berg
summer
lieutenants
who
had
been
called
into
service
for
the
manoeuvres
and
had
signed
their
names
along
with
the
other
officers
all
but
one
of
the
names
fell
upon
lilly
ear
unheeded
dehnicke
struck
her
as
a
little
odd
because
its
bourgeois
simplicity
did
not
seem
to
chime
in
well
with
the
ringing
charm
of
the
old
patrician
names
the
greeting
from
out
of
his
past
had
no
benign
influence
on
the
colonel
mood
he
grew
taciturn
then
surly
and
lilly
caught
a
sidelong
glance
of
his
fixed
on
her
which
caused
her
to
start
in
terror
it
was
so
wildly
fiercely
reproachful
thereafter
his
visits
to
the
neighbouring
garrison
town
grew
more
frequent
and
despite
his
painful
gout
he
never
refused
an
invitation
to
join
a
hunt
it
was
the
first
sunday
in
october
the
colonel
had
left
at
dawn
to
go
to
a
neighbour
with
the
intention
of
not
returning
until
late
at
night
a
soft
grey
mist
shot
with
violet
suggestions
of
the
sun
lay
over
the
ground
when
lilly
bored
and
writhing
internally
came
out
of
church
on
miss
von
schwertfeger
arm
the
sunflowers
in
the
tenants
gardens
were
already
sinking
their
singed
heads
and
the
asters
showed
signs
of
having
suffered
from
the
murderous
blows
of
jack
frost
but
the
air
was
as
sweet
and
spicy
as
in
spring
and
from
the
fields
came
a
singing
as
of
meadow
larks
such
a
day
such
a
day
thought
lilly
and
stretched
herself
in
a
vague
yearning
for
secret
conversation
and
glad
pranks
she
must
have
thought
a
little
too
loud
for
miss
von
schwertfeger
asked
what
the
matter
with
i
do
know
replied
lilly
blushing
i
feel
as
if
it
were
some
festival
miss
von
schwertfeger
looked
at
her
askance
and
said
emphasising
each
word
i
should
like
to
make
a
festival
of
it
for
myself
and
visit
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
city
but
the
colonel
is
away
and
i
do
know
lilly
started
so
violently
that
she
lost
her
breath
for
an
instant
but
she
mastered
herself
cleverly
and
began
to
persuade
miss
von
schwertfeger
first
speaking
coolly
then
more
warmly
and
urgently
she
needed
a
little
outing
she
had
left
the
place
all
summer
she
lived
like
a
prisoner
and
ought
to
grant
herself
at
least
one
hour
of
freedom
miss
von
schwertfeger
nodded
meditatively
and
that
glassy
stare
came
into
her
eyes
which
always
discomfited
lilly
at
the
midday
meal
which
the
two
took
in
each
other
company
she
was
still
undecided
but
as
soon
as
they
rose
from
table
she
ordered
the
carriage
to
be
brought
around
and
drove
off
without
saying
lilly
who
watched
her
departure
ran
for
the
the
foliage
of
the
creepers
still
hedged
in
her
little
domain
so
perfectly
that
von
prell
could
not
see
her
but
she
could
see
him
as
he
sat
at
the
open
window
brooding
over
a
book
with
a
deep
fold
between
his
brows
my
good
influence
thought
lilly
triumphantly
and
it
almost
made
her
feel
sorry
to
tear
him
away
from
so
salutary
an
occupation
the
inspector
and
the
bookkeeper
were
walking
up
and
down
near
the
lodge
smoking
their
sunday
afternoon
cigarettes
so
more
than
ordinary
caution
was
necessary
the
pellet
containing
her
missive
hit
von
prell
forehead
rebounded
and
fell
on
the
grass
outside
the
window
von
prell
had
himself
so
well
in
hand
that
he
even
refrained
from
looking
up
to
show
he
understood
after
a
while
however
he
let
the
book
fall
out
of
the
window
as
if
by
accident
and
then
got
up
to
fetch
it
with
an
indifferent
air
half
an
hour
later
they
met
behind
the
carp
pond
he
was
wearing
a
new
black
and
white
checked
fall
suit
similar
to
the
one
the
fateful
stranger
in
the
railroad
train
had
worn
you
entirely
too
elegant
lilly
joked
i
rather
not
be
in
your
company
that
would
be
a
sin
and
a
shame
he
observed
i
had
these
trappings
constructed
extra
for
why
for
because
our
festival
how
did
that
occur
to
you
she
faltered
startled
that
their
thoughts
had
taken
the
same
course
oh
a
person
gets
notions
he
replied
and
smiled
significantly
under
the
same
impulse
they
took
the
path
leading
to
the
beech
grove
which
they
had
wandered
through
on
the
first
evening
of
their
renewed
friendship
how
tommy
lilly
asked
recollecting
the
third
party
to
the
alliance
he
bit
away
the
flooring
in
my
room
and
dug
a
hole
for
himself
where
he
snarls
like
an
i
should
advise
you
to
stick
your
finger
into
his
hole
you
might
suddenly
lose
your
ring
and
your
finger
too
why
have
you
let
him
get
so
wild
she
asked
reproachfully
why
have
i
let
myself
get
so
wild
he
retorted
well
you
growing
tame
again
replied
lilly
caressing
him
with
her
eyes
his
recent
tameness
was
all
her
doing
do
you
think
so
he
asked
and
drew
his
brows
together
masterfully
as
in
his
lieutenant
days
have
i
your
word
of
honour
she
exulted
pshaw
lilly
basked
in
the
superbness
of
her
mission
of
salvation
no
matter
how
much
you
disdain
my
influence
she
replied
everybody
sees
that
a
change
has
taken
place
in
you
leichtweg
says
always
the
first
to
begin
work
now
you
borrowed
that
great
book
on
agriculture
from
the
colonel
it
impressed
him
tremendously
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
said
a
little
while
ago
you
always
look
so
appetizing
now
yes
von
prell
i
take
the
credit
for
all
this
and
if
things
continue
the
same
way
we
shall
remain
good
friends
apropos
of
appetizing
he
said
your
neck
beginning
back
of
your
ears
is
all
covered
with
tiny
silky
hairs
do
you
know
from
what
that
comes
oh
nonsense
lilly
exclaimed
blushing
why
do
you
know
a
wise
man
has
theories
for
instance
observe
this
plot
of
grass
he
pointed
to
a
clearing
below
them
through
which
a
rill
trickled
and
which
was
closely
grown
with
tender
juicy
grass
of
a
vivid
green
from
the
way
it
looks
you
suppose
it
was
still
spring
until
late
in
the
summer
that
plot
stood
under
water
and
the
spots
that
least
often
or
never
get
dry
grow
the
finest
down
that
nature
lilly
was
on
the
point
of
taking
his
botany
lesson
in
earnest
when
she
chanced
to
notice
the
wicked
grimace
he
was
making
then
she
understood
the
shameless
allusion
and
had
to
laugh
over
it
helplessly
listen
baronissima
how
about
playing
tag
we
owe
it
to
the
circulation
of
your
excellency
blood
the
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
with
a
blithe
shout
she
darted
off
down
the
slope
the
bottom
of
which
was
lost
in
the
purple
darkness
of
autumn
but
at
the
end
of
a
short
stretch
she
tripped
over
the
scotch
plaid
she
had
taken
along
and
had
refused
to
let
von
prell
carry
she
fell
full
length
and
he
came
just
in
time
to
help
her
to
her
feet
this
having
spoiled
lilly
taste
for
tag
they
mounted
the
hill
like
children
here
their
eyes
could
travel
over
a
rippling
lake
of
leaves
far
far
away
the
beeches
glowed
a
deep
red
the
maples
danced
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
the
birches
quivered
with
bright
flames
the
elm
flaunted
its
flakes
of
gold
while
the
oak
alone
obstinately
retained
its
green
garb
of
summer
lilly
stared
into
the
distance
the
sun
hid
itself
behind
clouds
from
which
fiery
tracks
descended
to
earth
a
narrow
band
of
scarlet
edged
the
horizon
shall
we
sit
down
here
asked
von
prell
no
not
here
said
lilly
seized
with
a
vague
dread
i
begin
to
cry
here
she
ran
ahead
of
him
back
into
the
woods
and
came
again
upon
the
path
leading
along
the
rill
here
the
darkness
of
evening
prevailed
but
the
in
which
they
had
been
enveloped
worked
its
magic
here
too
and
filled
her
heart
with
a
happy
devoutness
oh
how
happy
she
was
how
happy
she
was
no
fear
and
no
danger
so
far
as
her
thoughts
could
reach
and
no
danger
from
her
own
heart
for
the
man
walking
by
her
side
was
her
friend
and
playmate
nothing
more
he
might
not
and
could
not
be
anything
else
no
secret
wish
no
distorted
desire
came
from
him
or
went
to
meet
him
everything
uniting
him
to
her
was
clear
and
transparent
as
sunlight
even
if
the
others
must
not
have
a
suspicion
of
their
intercourse
there
was
no
sin
in
it
only
salvation
for
him
and
laughter
for
her
and
youth
for
both
she
felt
a
impulse
to
take
his
hand
but
fearing
to
be
misunderstood
she
checked
herself
thus
they
walked
at
each
other
side
to
the
spot
where
the
rill
was
caught
up
in
a
rotting
wooden
conduit
from
which
it
spouted
with
a
soft
singsong
withered
ferns
covered
the
light
green
moss
with
their
ragged
red
fronds
and
tired
leaves
came
fluttering
down
out
of
the
beech
trees
let
us
rest
here
suggested
lilly
but
it
damp
we
spread
the
plaid
she
said
eagerly
taking
the
blanket
from
him
he
had
managed
to
snatch
it
away
from
her
and
threw
it
over
the
fern
stalks
which
cracked
under
the
weight
she
sat
down
on
the
right
side
of
the
plaid
and
invited
him
to
make
use
of
the
left
side
to
keep
his
fine
new
suit
clean
do
you
hear
the
vesper
bells
he
asked
we
ought
to
be
eating
supper
now
we
poor
church
mice
we
have
nothing
she
laughed
who
told
you
so
he
asked
triumphantly
producing
a
small
paper
package
from
his
pocket
which
contained
a
mashed
crumbly
piece
of
cake
they
laid
it
between
them
and
ate
the
morsels
from
their
hollowed
hands
laughing
all
the
while
the
cake
tasted
like
sweet
wine
and
lilly
felicitously
hit
upon
its
correct
name
of
which
she
was
especially
fond
the
english
call
it
he
explained
it
quite
befuddles
one
that
amount
of
intoxication
i
risk
she
laughed
and
threw
herself
on
her
back
folding
her
hands
behind
her
head
she
lay
there
a
time
without
moving
and
looked
up
to
the
sky
of
which
jagged
oval
bits
shimmered
through
the
foliage
rosy
flakes
swam
in
the
opalescent
ether
and
way
beyond
appeared
the
vault
of
another
heaven
which
in
some
places
burst
through
the
nearer
sky
like
a
deep
blue
foreboding
lilly
stretched
her
arms
upward
yearningly
do
you
want
to
catch
the
larks
he
asked
no
not
that
but
she
would
like
to
have
one
of
the
falling
leaves
they
kept
dropping
dropping
from
the
boughs
like
birds
with
broken
wings
and
fluttered
over
the
ground
in
little
spirals
as
if
undecided
where
to
rest
we
see
to
which
of
us
the
first
one
comes
he
said
and
also
stretched
himself
on
his
back
the
one
to
whom
a
leaf
comes
first
will
be
blessed
with
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
she
added
they
lay
still
and
waited
at
last
one
floated
toward
him
and
prepared
to
settle
on
his
nose
but
he
would
not
permit
this
hers
must
be
that
great
piece
of
good
fortune
and
he
blew
the
leaf
back
to
her
she
in
turn
was
too
proud
to
accept
so
munificent
a
gift
and
blew
it
back
to
him
thus
laughing
and
tossing
themselves
about
they
kept
the
leaf
whirling
between
them
and
suddenly
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
their
lips
touched
touched
and
would
not
separate
the
next
instant
they
held
each
other
in
close
embrace
and
the
instant
after
she
was
his
the
rill
purled
the
leaves
fell
as
before
but
a
fiery
mist
lay
upon
the
earth
and
all
over
small
suns
winked
rainbow
coloured
eyes
why
had
it
happened
she
fell
back
without
thinking
and
noticed
that
the
heavens
above
were
also
clothed
in
fire
her
comrade
sat
beside
her
with
his
back
curved
like
a
berated
schoolboy
and
rubbed
his
nails
against
one
another
oh
let
go
home
said
lilly
downheartedly
as
my
lady
commands
he
replied
grotesquely
respectful
again
she
laughed
a
weary
mirthless
laugh
apparently
he
was
concerned
with
getting
rid
of
what
had
happened
as
speedily
as
possible
oh
now
it
all
the
same
she
sighed
now
we
can
quite
calmly
call
each
other
by
our
first
names
chapter
xxi
first
came
dread
the
same
senseless
dread
that
had
dominated
being
before
her
engagement
it
stiffened
her
limbs
bound
her
arms
to
her
body
crippled
her
knees
beat
against
the
walls
of
the
veins
in
her
neck
and
created
a
black
void
in
her
brain
but
after
she
had
gone
through
the
first
meeting
with
von
prell
and
nothing
fateful
occurred
her
fear
died
down
and
what
remained
was
a
searching
attentiveness
a
readiness
to
jump
aside
at
the
least
sign
of
danger
a
tense
anticipation
of
ticklish
questions
to
be
answered
properly
and
pitfalls
to
be
avoided
with
a
crafty
assumption
of
innocence
the
colonel
noticed
nothing
he
the
most
suspicious
of
married
men
with
the
keenest
scent
who
harboured
the
least
illusions
concerning
the
opposite
sex
he
noticed
nothing
he
even
believed
the
headache
myth
and
lavished
mocking
yet
tender
pity
upon
her
while
he
sat
at
her
bedside
laughing
and
helping
her
change
the
compresses
that
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
solicitously
prepared
it
was
more
difficult
for
lilly
to
endure
the
woman
caresses
behind
them
lurked
a
squinting
pair
of
eyes
shy
heedful
and
endeavouring
to
look
harmless
while
in
spite
of
themselves
revealing
a
greedy
desire
to
know
the
anxiety
that
so
far
as
the
colonel
was
concerned
gradually
lulled
itself
to
sleep
grew
sharper
with
regard
to
the
friend
who
at
any
moment
might
become
her
enemy
and
betrayer
lilly
did
not
dare
to
cry
until
night
time
when
she
felt
sure
of
being
alone
she
would
jump
out
of
bed
to
wash
her
eyes
go
back
to
bed
again
and
cry
until
sleep
took
her
in
its
soothing
arms
it
was
not
shame
nor
regret
nor
longing
love
it
was
a
feeling
of
infinite
solitariness
it
was
a
straying
about
in
perplexity
what
will
happen
now
for
something
must
surely
happen
confession
convent
flight
together
suicide
together
or
one
of
all
those
events
described
in
asmussen
books
as
following
upon
so
atrocious
a
deed
the
week
passed
lilly
had
arisen
from
her
sick
bed
several
days
before
but
she
had
not
seen
von
prell
she
could
discover
no
signs
of
him
even
when
she
locked
all
the
entrances
to
her
room
and
rushed
to
the
window
for
a
glimpse
of
him
all
the
while
the
colonel
kept
recommending
horseback
riding
there
was
von
prell
to
take
her
and
the
exercise
would
do
her
good
at
last
saturday
at
dusk
she
felt
she
had
to
yield
they
would
meet
at
dinner
the
next
day
at
any
rate
the
horses
were
pawing
before
the
door
the
moment
for
the
meeting
before
which
she
had
recoiled
had
arrived
with
its
threat
of
fresh
dangers
when
she
saw
her
friend
ascend
the
terrace
steps
in
his
high
shiny
riding
boots
looking
pale
and
thin
and
moving
as
if
by
springs
to
display
his
counterfeit
respect
something
within
her
suddenly
turned
numb
why
that
young
man
there
is
an
utter
stranger
she
felt
he
concern
you
in
the
least
you
are
looking
upon
him
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
they
rode
out
of
the
gate
the
colonel
had
gone
to
the
stables
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
stood
on
the
terrace
with
her
hands
clasped
and
looked
after
them
the
road
muddy
with
recent
rains
plashed
under
the
horses
hoofs
and
a
cold
evening
wind
crinkled
the
winter
wheat
a
yellow
sheen
hiding
the
sun
glimmered
behind
the
ragged
birch
boughs
everything
looked
sad
and
weary
it
even
seemed
a
vain
task
to
have
sowed
the
winter
wheat
they
trotted
on
side
by
side
in
silence
a
long
long
series
of
anxious
moments
he
must
speak
some
time
thought
lilly
biting
her
tongue
till
it
bled
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
undeviatingly
upon
the
road
ahead
making
only
slight
movements
of
his
right
hand
from
time
to
time
to
adjust
his
reins
he
call
me
lady
again
she
thought
and
felt
ashamed
in
advance
for
both
of
them
finally
she
took
heart
and
spoke
to
him
do
walk
your
horse
she
said
almost
crying
of
course
comrade
he
replied
and
reined
in
his
chestnut
comrade
comrade
she
burst
out
and
passionately
searched
his
eyes
with
hers
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
always
when
he
feared
a
scolding
and
said
nothing
say
something
wo
you
she
screamed
quite
beside
herself
what
should
i
say
he
queried
making
a
little
gesture
as
if
to
scratch
his
head
it
a
nasty
business
we
know
it
and
muttering
to
himself
he
repeated
nasty
business
nasty
business
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
she
cried
my
dear
friend
he
replied
i
am
small
my
heart
is
small
it
not
a
suitable
spot
for
harbouring
great
anguish
of
the
soul
pshaw
who
speaking
of
anguish
of
the
soul
but
what
to
become
of
us
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
as
soon
as
i
come
into
possession
of
an
unencumbered
manorial
estate
he
replied
with
a
gesture
of
invitation
a
castle
stables
vehicles
and
other
animate
and
inanimate
things
thereunto
appertaining
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
applying
to
your
husband
for
your
hand
this
completely
robbed
lilly
of
her
if
you
keep
on
making
such
jokes
she
screamed
bursting
into
tears
i
ride
to
death
now
before
your
very
eyes
a
difficult
thing
to
do
with
that
nag
of
yours
lilly
was
at
her
wits
end
and
simply
let
the
tears
course
down
her
cheeks
in
silence
at
last
he
changed
his
tone
well
well
child
he
said
be
sensible
for
a
change
all
i
want
to
do
is
tickle
the
superfluous
tragedy
out
of
your
soul
and
as
soon
as
you
make
a
glad
face
again
i
try
to
give
the
matter
most
serious
consideration
lilly
wiped
her
tears
away
with
the
flap
of
her
riding
gauntlet
and
smiled
at
him
obediently
fine
he
praised
her
was
not
idle
in
the
poet
to
write
weine
selten
weine
schwer
wer
tränen
hat
hat
auch
i
tell
you
something
we
two
pretty
orphans
were
exactly
meant
for
each
other
and
we
been
brought
together
here
in
this
enchanted
castle
but
we
should
have
to
meet
no
matter
where
even
if
we
had
been
two
hearts
that
beat
as
one
long
before
to
be
accurate
the
colonel
married
us
right
at
the
beginning
and
the
only
shame
is
that
your
marriage
contract
with
him
was
drawn
up
accordingly
but
that
not
to
be
altered
and
we
shall
have
to
get
around
the
matter
in
secret
ways
see
here
child
we
both
are
headed
in
the
same
direction
on
the
sea
of
life
we
have
the
same
to
win
and
the
same
to
lose
so
cheer
up
go
it
we
ragtag
and
bobtail
both
of
us
at
any
rate
i
not
ragtag
and
bobtail
cried
lilly
flaring
up
i
have
pride
and
a
sense
of
honour
and
even
if
i
have
sinned
a
thousandfold
i
know
how
to
die
for
my
sins
it
not
so
easy
to
die
usually
the
opportunity
is
lacking
and
when
the
opportunity
once
presents
itself
we
show
it
a
clean
pair
of
heels
lilly
felt
a
hot
desire
to
protect
him
against
the
in
which
he
indulged
you
do
believe
what
you
say
she
cried
you
are
the
boldest
the
most
daring
of
men
i
know
you
are
without
a
moment
hesitation
you
would
face
death
for
the
sake
of
your
honour
if
you
would
only
summon
all
your
strength
the
whole
world
would
lie
at
your
feet
i
will
always
keep
reminding
you
of
that
i
will
work
over
you
until
you
get
back
belief
in
yourself
until
you
feel
you
are
on
the
upward
road
i
will
share
all
your
hardships
all
your
temptations
and
i
will
protect
you
from
all
evil
for
what
should
i
be
here
if
not
for
you
she
felt
she
was
so
completely
his
that
she
could
have
thrown
herself
at
his
horse
hoofs
and
when
she
recalled
the
first
moments
of
their
meeting
that
day
she
could
scarcely
realise
why
he
had
seemed
so
repulsive
and
alien
you
a
touching
creature
he
replied
it
really
lucky
the
creepers
on
your
balcony
are
so
thoroughly
knit
together
she
started
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
faltered
oppressed
by
a
foreboding
of
and
lucky
the
ladder
was
left
there
it
can
be
leaned
against
the
balcony
and
the
vines
can
break
all
they
want
to
even
miss
von
schwertfeger
would
notice
anything
amiss
well
he
blinked
his
silvery
lids
at
her
enticingly
she
did
not
know
where
to
turn
to
hide
her
face
from
his
gaze
she
felt
so
ashamed
i
never
belong
to
you
again
she
cried
i
swear
i
wo
by
all
the
saints
i
should
be
a
thing
of
loathing
to
myself
as
for
you
i
should
utterly
despise
you
pah
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
pity
to
lose
the
opportunity
he
observed
and
turned
the
heads
he
appeared
at
dinner
the
next
day
virtuous
in
his
and
black
necktie
he
strutted
and
scraped
and
bowed
pursed
his
lips
in
extravagant
respect
and
scarcely
dared
to
take
the
demitasse
from
her
hand
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
eyes
passed
between
the
two
watching
and
questioning
late
that
sunday
night
the
following
occurred
the
colonel
had
gone
off
to
town
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
retired
to
her
room
and
lilly
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
in
her
nightgown
brushing
her
hair
suddenly
she
heard
a
gentle
tapping
at
the
window
as
if
the
autumn
wind
were
blowing
a
twig
against
the
closed
shutter
but
the
action
of
the
wind
is
irregular
and
this
sound
kept
time
now
a
little
louder
now
a
little
softer
and
recurred
at
even
intervals
it
frightened
her
and
she
wanted
to
run
down
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
but
she
bethought
herself
in
time
she
hastily
put
on
her
dressing
gown
cautiously
raised
the
window
and
opened
the
shutters
the
least
bit
at
first
she
saw
nothing
there
were
no
stars
in
the
heavens
and
the
whole
of
the
lodge
seemed
buried
in
darkness
then
she
thought
she
saw
a
staff
waving
up
and
down
close
to
the
shutter
she
opened
the
shutter
an
inch
wider
and
recognised
the
now
she
knew
what
was
up
she
jumped
back
and
drew
the
bolt
then
threw
herself
back
in
bed
where
she
lay
holding
her
fingers
in
her
ears
but
when
she
withdrew
them
she
again
heard
that
short
regular
tapping
which
now
rose
almost
to
a
knocking
the
nightwatch
who
made
the
rounds
of
the
court
and
park
once
an
hour
need
only
find
the
ladder
leaning
against
the
balcony
and
all
was
lost
her
fright
deprived
her
of
her
senses
trembling
in
every
limb
she
ran
into
her
dressing
room
where
there
was
no
light
and
opened
the
balcony
door
about
half
an
inch
through
the
crack
she
whispered
into
the
darkness
go
away
and
never
try
such
a
thing
again
then
she
listened
with
her
ear
to
the
opening
nothing
to
be
seen
or
heard
but
when
she
wanted
to
close
the
door
it
would
not
go
shut
she
groped
along
the
crack
in
search
of
the
obstacle
and
came
upon
a
round
hollow
wooden
something
which
an
invisible
hand
had
shoved
there
the
wretched
she
moaned
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
the
next
moment
was
hanging
in
his
arms
in
a
half
swoon
after
that
evening
he
had
her
completely
in
his
power
defenceless
without
a
will
of
her
own
at
the
mercy
of
his
wishes
and
whims
it
was
not
happiness
she
experienced
scarcely
a
single
transport
of
feeling
that
came
later
when
she
had
conquered
her
horror
of
the
monstrous
deed
and
her
fear
of
discovery
had
weakened
nothing
occurred
to
disturb
them
and
lilly
expanded
in
a
sense
of
defiant
security
then
it
was
a
blissful
sailing
over
awful
abysms
a
delirium
of
the
senses
a
nebulous
ecstasy
a
delightful
writhing
under
lacerating
blows
an
ebb
and
flow
of
magnanimous
scorn
of
self
and
blasphemous
prayers
laughter
came
again
not
the
old
simple
laughter
that
had
dominated
the
play
of
her
spirit
until
within
a
short
time
before
no
this
laughter
was
sardonic
exultation
the
exultation
of
the
hounded
thief
who
carries
his
booty
off
to
security
behind
the
backs
of
his
pursuers
lilly
also
found
reasons
for
justifying
herself
i
am
merely
fulfilling
my
destiny
i
am
now
getting
back
the
possession
which
fate
promised
to
me
and
which
the
old
man
so
long
kept
from
me
in
addition
there
was
a
redeeming
element
in
all
she
did
consecrating
the
most
arrant
deception
and
endowing
it
with
purity
this
was
the
consciousness
that
he
was
being
saved
under
the
spell
of
a
lofty
love
he
would
learn
to
scorn
vulgar
escapades
and
borne
on
the
wings
of
a
woman
expiating
favour
he
would
rise
to
the
heights
on
which
men
and
heroes
dwell
with
these
thoughts
she
drugged
her
conscience
each
time
and
when
he
lay
in
her
arms
she
gave
them
whispered
expression
the
doors
were
not
heavy
and
all
sounds
must
be
muffled
he
laughed
and
kissed
the
words
from
her
mouth
if
she
grew
uneasy
and
demanded
pledges
he
vowed
the
stars
out
of
the
heaven
miss
von
schwertfeger
now
never
stayed
in
lilly
room
later
than
eleven
this
was
the
hour
he
might
come
and
by
half
past
one
he
had
to
be
gone
of
course
he
had
to
confine
his
visits
to
the
evenings
when
the
colonel
went
to
town
on
account
of
the
time
the
trains
ran
the
colonel
could
not
possibly
return
before
two
besides
the
carriage
could
be
heard
at
some
distance
before
walter
left
he
had
to
unlock
the
door
to
the
colonel
room
and
smoke
a
cigarette
to
rid
the
atmosphere
of
the
stable
and
leather
smell
he
brought
with
him
from
his
own
room
for
it
often
happened
that
the
colonel
stuck
his
head
in
before
going
to
bed
or
if
the
wine
had
loosened
his
tongue
he
would
even
awaken
lilly
seat
himself
at
her
bedside
laugh
cast
about
his
dagger
glances
pick
his
yellow
teeth
and
tell
the
juiciest
stories
which
had
arrived
fresh
from
the
berlin
centres
of
obscenity
and
made
the
rounds
of
his
club
in
town
lilly
played
the
drowsy
pussy
and
purred
and
yawned
she
began
to
feel
so
secure
that
once
she
actually
fell
asleep
right
in
the
middle
of
a
laugh
oh
if
only
there
had
been
no
miss
von
schwertfeger
not
that
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
noticed
anything
the
horrors
of
such
a
possibility
were
inconceivable
but
her
restless
hasty
comings
and
goings
the
almost
anxious
greed
with
which
she
pried
about
gave
sufficient
cause
for
concern
she
looked
very
pale
and
worn
while
the
fleshy
region
about
her
mouth
and
her
sharp
scenting
nose
glowed
a
still
deeper
red
you
might
suppose
she
tippled
in
secret
but
such
thing
would
be
bound
to
leak
out
and
at
table
scarce
a
drop
passed
her
lips
let
her
do
whatever
she
wants
to
thought
lilly
if
only
she
come
spying
on
me
as
she
did
on
katie
and
sometimes
it
occurred
to
lilly
that
she
herself
was
no
better
than
the
poor
maid
katie
whom
they
had
chased
from
the
castle
chapter
xxii
it
was
shortly
before
midnight
one
evening
late
in
november
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
said
and
was
sitting
at
lilly
pillow
wet
and
frozen
through
he
had
been
standing
in
the
chilly
drizzle
a
long
time
before
the
signal
agreed
upon
two
rattles
of
the
shutter
bolt
had
summoned
him
to
her
room
now
everything
was
serene
the
entire
house
was
asleep
the
watchman
had
made
his
rounds
and
the
ladder
which
von
prell
drew
up
after
him
for
greater
security
reposed
peacefully
on
the
balcony
the
chandelier
bathed
the
warm
perfumed
room
in
the
light
of
a
summer
evening
drops
of
rain
splashed
softly
against
the
shutters
and
the
november
wind
whined
like
a
beggar
lilly
lay
comfortably
under
her
blue
silk
quilt
holding
his
hand
and
dreaming
up
into
his
face
which
even
in
moments
of
retained
its
expression
of
abashed
roguery
she
saw
the
freckled
bridge
of
his
nose
the
blinking
eyes
the
peaked
chin
covered
with
stubble
and
almost
hidden
by
the
green
collar
of
his
working
jacket
he
could
no
longer
smarten
himself
for
her
sake
his
housemates
might
notice
the
change
they
did
not
say
much
to
each
other
if
only
he
was
with
her
he
who
belonged
to
her
in
life
and
death
who
like
herself
had
been
cast
astray
in
this
strange
world
she
drew
his
head
down
and
stroked
his
forehead
smooth
from
lack
of
a
man
cares
and
wiped
away
a
few
drops
still
clinging
to
his
temples
the
clock
on
the
wall
struck
twelve
softly
the
hanging
lamp
swung
back
and
forth
casting
long
sliding
shadows
on
the
ceiling
like
the
shadow
of
a
rocking
cradle
or
like
great
raven
wings
flitting
to
and
fro
inaudibly
suddenly
from
the
court
came
the
rumble
of
carriage
wheels
whether
in
arrival
or
departure
they
could
not
determine
both
started
up
and
listened
and
looked
at
the
clock
twelve
impossible
the
horses
were
never
harnessed
before
quarter
to
two
they
would
have
to
wait
entirely
too
long
at
the
station
perhaps
it
was
the
milkman
who
had
been
delayed
at
the
railroad
in
getting
his
cans
they
calmed
down
a
long
precious
hour
was
still
ahead
of
them
rich
in
pleasures
and
oblivion
to
express
his
triumph
von
prell
sucked
in
his
cheeks
and
rounded
his
eyes
with
a
luxurious
smile
lilly
put
out
her
arms
and
drew
herself
up
to
him
at
that
instant
three
short
sharp
raps
sounded
on
the
door
opening
into
the
corridor
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
called
open
the
door
lilly
at
once
walter
jumped
to
his
feet
when
lilly
looked
around
he
had
already
left
the
room
she
felt
a
ringing
in
her
ears
a
dull
desire
to
let
herself
sink
down
but
renewed
raps
at
the
door
tore
her
out
of
bed
and
insisted
upon
her
turning
the
key
before
she
could
stow
herself
under
the
covers
again
to
conceal
her
overwhelming
shame
she
noticed
miss
von
schwertfeger
look
about
the
room
hastily
make
a
dash
for
something
round
and
grey
unostentatiously
lying
in
a
corner
lilly
did
not
realise
it
was
walter
cap
until
later
shove
back
the
bolt
of
the
door
to
the
colonel
room
and
then
in
sudden
transition
to
tranquillity
seat
herself
alongside
pillow
be
careful
not
to
cry
lilly
heard
her
say
and
that
instant
the
colonel
step
resounded
in
the
corridor
well
well
so
late
how
time
does
fly
when
you
talk
cried
miss
von
schwertfeger
for
the
benefit
of
the
colonel
before
he
entered
her
voice
expressed
endless
astonishment
there
he
stood
disagreeably
surprised
it
seemed
not
to
find
his
young
wife
alone
where
did
you
drop
from
all
of
a
sudden
colonel
you
did
order
a
special
train
did
you
you
could
have
flown
here
either
at
least
i
never
observed
that
you
possess
the
art
of
flying
have
you
lilly
dear
poor
lilly
lying
there
perfectly
stiff
with
surprise
thus
miss
von
schwertfeger
talked
against
time
evidently
trying
to
secure
a
few
moments
for
lilly
in
which
she
might
pull
herself
together
and
the
colonel
had
to
render
account
on
the
way
to
the
station
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
one
of
the
neighbours
he
mentioned
the
name
was
celebrating
his
birthday
that
day
so
he
drove
over
to
his
place
instead
of
going
to
town
well
said
miss
von
schwertfeger
the
greatest
marvels
have
the
simplest
explanations
dear
i
hope
you
sleep
well
and
get
rid
of
that
headache
of
yours
the
colonel
pricked
up
his
ears
if
she
has
a
headache
why
did
you
let
her
go
to
sleep
long
ago
when
once
aroused
not
the
least
inconsistency
escaped
his
attention
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
his
match
and
rejoined
without
an
instant
hesitation
she
wanted
compresses
again
but
i
thought
it
better
simply
to
hold
my
hand
to
her
forehead
she
was
just
about
to
go
to
sleep
and
we
ought
not
to
disturb
her
any
more
do
you
agree
with
me
colonel
colonel
with
that
she
extinguished
the
lights
lilly
wanted
to
cry
to
her
stay
here
stay
here
he
choke
me
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
was
already
out
in
the
corridor
and
she
had
done
such
excellent
preliminary
work
that
the
colonel
after
a
brief
i
hope
you
feel
better
to
lilly
left
the
room
without
further
question
had
he
remained
the
game
might
have
ended
in
a
nervous
breakdown
lilly
lay
in
bed
paralysed
by
a
dull
fright
listening
now
for
sounds
in
the
colonel
room
now
to
the
wailing
of
the
wind
interrupted
for
three
or
four
seconds
by
a
very
very
soft
rustle
that
was
the
ladder
gliding
over
the
rail
as
walter
let
it
down
from
the
balcony
so
long
as
he
had
seen
the
light
in
lilly
room
he
had
wisely
remained
on
the
balcony
she
could
hear
him
remove
the
ladder
and
set
it
where
it
belonged
now
at
length
now
that
she
felt
they
were
both
secure
came
a
shuddering
realisation
of
what
had
happened
accompanied
by
a
desire
to
call
out
and
cry
aloud
anna
von
schwertfeger
what
had
her
conduct
meant
what
had
impelled
her
to
implicate
herself
in
so
sinful
a
deed
was
she
risking
her
name
her
existence
the
reward
of
many
years
labour
how
had
lilly
wretched
sinner
that
she
was
come
to
deserve
so
great
a
sacrifice
her
heart
expanded
in
gratitude
she
could
no
longer
endure
lying
in
bed
she
would
have
to
go
down
and
thank
anna
forthwith
she
dressed
without
making
a
sound
took
the
precaution
to
bolt
the
door
between
the
two
bedrooms
and
slipped
out
into
the
dark
corridor
where
she
peeped
through
the
keyhole
of
the
colonel
room
and
saw
him
lying
in
bed
already
the
old
oak
steps
cracked
frightfully
but
they
had
that
habit
even
when
no
one
was
walking
on
them
and
often
kept
up
the
sound
of
a
tread
all
night
light
was
shining
in
miss
von
schwertfeger
room
lilly
heard
her
sharp
hard
steps
as
she
paced
to
and
fro
finally
she
ventured
to
knock
who
there
i
anna
i
lilly
what
do
you
want
go
back
to
bed
no
no
no
i
must
speak
to
you
i
must
the
door
opened
well
then
come
in
lilly
wanted
to
throw
her
arms
about
miss
von
schwertfeger
neck
but
she
shook
her
off
i
not
in
the
mood
for
scenes
she
said
her
voice
which
she
muffled
with
difficulty
had
lost
all
traces
of
sympathy
and
you
need
thank
me
because
i
did
not
act
from
love
of
you
lilly
seemed
very
small
to
herself
and
very
much
scolded
since
the
days
of
her
thrashings
at
the
hands
of
asmussen
no
one
had
ever
given
her
such
a
reception
first
you
help
me
she
faltered
and
then
since
you
are
here
you
might
as
well
answer
some
questions
i
have
to
ask
said
miss
von
schwertfeger
close
your
dress
it
cold
here
and
sit
down
lilly
obeyed
in
the
first
place
did
i
in
any
way
ever
help
to
bring
about
a
meeting
between
you
and
that
man
when
could
you
have
that
what
i
am
asking
on
the
contrary
you
were
even
willing
for
me
to
take
the
riding
lessons
then
later
did
i
ever
leave
you
without
supervision
while
you
were
taking
your
lessons
without
supervision
why
almost
always
you
yourself
were
present
was
it
i
who
proposed
your
going
out
riding
alone
with
him
you
of
course
not
the
first
time
we
went
without
asking
and
after
that
it
was
the
colonel
who
wanted
us
to
was
i
careful
to
see
that
everything
in
your
room
was
in
order
i
do
know
i
think
so
why
even
lately
i
noticed
you
come
to
my
room
before
you
went
to
bed
as
if
to
say
you
probably
taken
me
to
be
your
enemy
your
spy
you
would
put
yourself
out
for
me
very
much
i
thought
miss
von
schwertfeger
laughed
a
hard
dreary
laugh
what
you
say
is
very
valuable
she
said
it
proves
to
me
that
i
made
no
blunders
in
carrying
out
my
plan
and
need
not
reproach
myself
for
anything
what
plan
asked
lilly
utterly
bewildered
miss
von
schwertfeger
measured
her
with
a
glance
of
pitying
scorn
my
dear
child
i
knew
everything
i
saw
it
coming
from
the
very
first
the
moment
you
met
him
i
calculated
it
on
my
fingers
the
way
i
calculate
the
cost
of
a
meal
i
simply
let
matters
drift
i
could
do
so
without
dishonouring
myself
besides
there
was
no
use
interfering
you
were
bent
upon
your
own
ruin
what
have
i
done
to
you
lilly
stammered
swallowing
her
tears
to
make
you
hate
me
so
i
never
wanted
to
oust
you
from
your
position
i
subjected
myself
to
you
from
the
very
first
i
put
myself
completely
into
your
hands
and
now
you
do
this
to
me
if
i
hated
you
you
would
be
sitting
here
you
would
probably
be
straying
along
some
country
road
i
had
you
in
my
grasp
and
could
have
crushed
you
at
least
a
dozen
times
but
did
however
i
tell
you
the
truth
i
hate
you
that
is
before
i
knew
you
i
imagined
you
a
sly
fresh
little
thing
who
held
off
from
the
colonel
in
a
pure
spirit
of
calculation
until
he
adopted
the
extreme
measure
to
which
old
libertines
resort
in
such
cases
but
when
i
saw
you
you
dear
child
without
malice
or
guile
defenceless
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
to
love
the
colonel
and
me
too
if
possible
i
had
to
back
down
i
and
my
hate
then
you
became
nothing
else
to
me
than
a
small
insignificant
creature
which
one
uses
so
long
as
it
is
serviceable
and
shoves
aside
after
it
has
fulfilled
its
purpose
i
am
not
concerned
with
you
any
more
you
dropped
out
of
the
game
long
ago
and
now
the
colonel
and
myself
are
playing
it
alone
i
have
to
have
it
out
with
him
and
then
my
work
done
lilly
felt
nothing
but
dull
impotent
astonishment
as
if
doors
were
being
opened
and
curtains
drawn
aside
and
she
were
looking
into
hearts
as
into
a
fiery
abyss
i
thought
you
were
so
attached
to
him
she
said
i
thought
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
her
first
suspicion
had
not
been
far
from
the
truth
this
hardened
commanding
spinster
whose
beauty
was
not
yet
entirely
faded
had
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
her
employer
some
ten
or
fifteen
years
before
had
then
been
neglected
and
was
now
taking
revenge
miss
von
schwertfeger
divined
her
thoughts
and
dismissed
them
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
had
it
been
that
she
said
i
should
have
known
how
to
acquiesce
in
my
fate
and
if
i
had
still
retained
my
place
in
the
castle
i
should
have
cherished
it
as
my
sanctuary
no
my
dear
matters
in
this
world
are
not
so
simple
there
are
even
worse
hells
lilly
now
heard
a
story
which
filled
her
soul
with
horror
and
pity
the
story
of
the
house
she
lived
in
the
story
of
which
she
was
the
concluding
chapter
the
colonel
who
had
always
been
a
man
of
violence
and
a
mad
voluptuary
had
insisted
upon
taking
in
pupils
in
housekeeping
under
the
pretext
that
when
he
came
home
on
leave
he
had
to
have
youth
and
jollity
about
him
he
reserved
for
himself
the
choice
of
the
pupils
in
this
way
only
those
came
whom
he
had
decided
upon
in
advance
for
a
long
time
miss
von
schwertfeger
noticed
nothing
amiss
but
the
servants
began
to
tell
her
stories
of
secret
orgies
and
mad
chases
on
the
upper
floor
of
how
the
colonel
pursued
girls
clad
in
glittering
raiment
the
colonel
had
always
liked
transparent
robes
of
silver
miss
von
schwertfeger
eyes
were
completely
opened
when
some
of
the
girls
attempted
suicide
she
left
but
she
was
poor
and
accustomed
to
command
and
she
could
not
endure
subordinate
positions
dreadful
distress
was
the
result
the
colonel
had
not
lost
her
from
sight
and
when
it
seemed
to
him
she
had
sunk
low
enough
he
again
offered
her
the
position
of
housekeeper
in
his
castle
promising
she
would
have
nothing
to
complain
of
she
crawled
back
to
him
like
a
starved
dog
soon
he
broke
his
word
and
the
indecent
began
again
but
she
no
longer
had
the
courage
to
resist
she
learned
to
be
blind
and
deaf
when
lewd
glances
were
exchanged
at
table
and
screams
and
laughter
penetrated
to
her
room
during
the
night
she
even
learned
to
keep
curious
servants
at
a
distance
and
throw
a
cover
of
concealment
over
the
house
shame
her
relation
to
the
girls
became
motherly
i
should
be
surprised
she
interposed
if
he
had
made
the
same
proposition
to
you
saying
i
would
take
care
of
you
the
fateful
evening
in
which
she
had
become
the
colonel
betrothed
arose
in
lilly
memory
while
walking
about
her
greedily
still
in
a
state
of
indecision
he
had
spoken
of
a
fine
aristocratic
woman
under
whose
protection
she
should
live
in
his
castle
until
she
had
grown
into
womanhood
miss
von
schwertfeger
went
on
with
her
recital
she
described
how
rage
at
the
disgraceful
position
she
was
in
ate
into
her
soul
like
a
malignant
cancer
how
it
finally
took
sole
possession
of
her
being
to
the
exclusion
of
every
feeling
except
the
desire
for
reprisal
his
marriage
should
furnish
the
weapons
she
would
be
blind
and
deaf
just
as
she
had
been
compelled
to
be
before
nothing
else
she
would
simply
let
matters
take
their
natural
course
thus
she
had
acted
until
that
night
and
that
night
the
sword
must
surely
have
fallen
on
lilly
and
the
colonel
but
at
the
last
decisive
moment
she
realised
her
strength
would
not
hold
out
that
young
guiltless
yet
guilty
wife
had
become
too
dear
to
her
she
could
not
sacrifice
lilly
to
her
scheme
of
revenge
i
thought
you
said
you
had
acted
out
of
love
for
me
lilly
ventured
to
interject
miss
von
schwertfeger
fixed
her
eyes
on
lilly
face
in
an
aggrieved
stare
my
dear
child
if
you
were
a
stupid
thing
who
has
to
sin
in
order
to
mature
you
would
have
a
better
understanding
of
what
goes
on
inside
a
person
like
myself
for
the
present
be
satisfied
that
you
are
out
of
danger
in
a
gush
of
gratitude
lilly
threw
herself
on
miss
von
schwertfeger
and
kissed
her
face
and
hands
and
miss
von
schwertfeger
no
longer
repulsed
her
she
stroked
her
hair
and
spoke
to
her
as
to
a
child
kneeling
at
her
feet
lilly
confessed
she
told
how
her
relations
with
walter
had
developed
insensibly
how
they
had
been
old
friends
and
how
he
had
really
been
the
author
of
her
happiness
happiness
miss
von
schwertfeger
drawled
and
drew
in
the
air
through
the
right
corner
of
her
mouth
causing
a
sound
like
a
whistle
lilly
started
looked
at
her
and
understood
the
question
burned
in
her
brain
am
i
better
than
i
should
have
been
had
i
allowed
the
colonel
to
drag
me
here
without
marrying
me
eleven
months
had
passed
since
that
night
when
he
courted
her
she
put
her
arms
about
miss
von
schwertfeger
and
cried
cried
cried
it
was
so
good
to
know
there
was
a
sisterly
no
a
motherly
person
in
whose
dress
she
could
bury
her
tearful
face
she
had
not
experienced
such
easement
since
the
day
a
certain
knife
had
been
waved
over
her
head
the
affair
with
von
prell
of
course
could
not
go
on
he
and
lilly
must
not
meet
even
once
again
miss
von
schwertfeger
demanded
it
and
lilly
acquiesced
without
a
word
of
protest
if
only
she
had
not
had
her
mission
what
mission
asked
miss
von
schwertfeger
lilly
told
of
the
holy
task
she
had
to
perform
in
his
life
how
her
love
had
awakened
him
to
the
realisation
of
a
loftier
purer
life
how
she
had
to
answer
with
every
drop
of
blood
in
her
body
for
his
rising
to
better
things
and
entering
upon
a
noble
beneficent
field
of
activity
it
was
miss
von
schwertfeger
turn
to
be
astonished
she
listened
and
looked
at
lilly
with
great
doubting
eyes
then
got
up
and
paced
the
room
agitatedly
muttering
incredible
incredible
when
lilly
asked
her
what
was
incredible
she
kissed
her
on
her
forehead
and
said
you
poor
thing
why
because
you
will
suffer
much
in
life
thereupon
it
was
agreed
that
miss
von
schwertfeger
should
speak
with
him
once
again
and
the
price
of
her
silence
was
to
be
the
breaking
off
of
all
relations
between
him
and
lilly
they
must
not
take
their
rides
together
either
lilly
begged
for
only
one
thing
to
be
allowed
to
write
him
a
farewell
letter
she
thought
she
owed
this
to
him
so
that
he
should
not
harbour
doubts
of
her
and
his
future
then
the
two
women
parted
released
redeemed
born
into
a
new
life
lilly
walked
upstairs
forgetting
every
precaution
but
thank
goodness
the
colonel
was
snoring
the
clock
struck
four
and
the
shuffling
of
the
stablemen
already
resounded
in
the
courtyard
before
lilly
threw
herself
in
bed
she
cast
a
look
of
farewell
at
the
lodge
and
rejoiced
that
renunciation
was
so
easy
she
had
not
thought
it
possible
chapter
xxiii
dear
beloved
von
prell
from
what
has
happened
you
can
imagine
that
everything
between
us
must
come
to
an
end
yes
all
over
we
shall
never
see
each
other
except
at
meal
times
if
you
ask
me
whether
i
am
very
sad
i
will
be
brave
and
say
no
hoping
thereby
to
assuage
the
pain
of
parting
for
both
of
us
but
easy
or
difficult
that
not
the
question
the
main
thing
is
our
feelings
should
raise
us
to
pure
heights
true
greatness
of
renunciation
must
illumine
our
lives
yes
i
expect
you
to
show
the
greatness
of
renunciation
our
lives
after
this
must
be
dedicated
entirely
to
recollections
of
the
past
besides
can
we
hope
ever
again
to
find
anything
so
beautiful
as
those
unspeakably
exquisite
hours
we
passed
together
i
have
given
up
thoughts
of
happiness
and
you
must
do
the
same
from
now
on
my
one
sacred
interest
will
be
my
husband
welfare
and
i
ask
you
with
all
the
strength
you
possess
likewise
to
labour
at
the
reconstruction
of
your
life
life
is
earnest
solemn
holy
i
feel
it
is
the
conviction
comes
upon
me
with
force
and
has
possessed
me
ever
since
i
was
led
back
to
the
right
path
by
a
friend
of
mine
you
must
feel
it
too
this
letter
is
my
last
to
you
write
to
me
once
again
oh
only
once
and
stick
the
answer
in
the
which
still
stands
on
the
balcony
i
shall
have
no
peace
until
i
know
our
souls
are
united
by
the
same
ideal
farewell
and
at
table
do
make
any
secret
allusions
to
the
past
you
would
merely
hurt
me
and
make
me
doubt
your
good
faith
ever
with
feelings
of
sisterly
friendship
your
dearest
friend
the
profound
emotions
which
have
held
me
in
their
grip
since
my
interview
with
our
honoured
friend
have
if
possible
been
deepened
by
your
lovely
letter
i
feel
a
tremendous
impulse
to
accomplish
by
deeds
of
atonement
that
which
has
never
yet
been
i
am
prepared
to
scorn
the
seven
deadly
sins
i
will
carry
in
mind
all
the
paragons
of
virtue
from
the
young
tobias
to
helena
and
will
try
to
find
that
pure
happiness
in
the
great
renunciation
you
demand
of
me
which
alone
they
say
is
unalloyed
with
regret
an
advantage
which
bears
little
weight
with
me
since
i
am
acquainted
with
that
evil
institution
only
by
hearsay
well
then
dearest
most
charming
of
women
farewell
it
was
delightful
i
can
swear
to
that
without
perjuring
myself
should
you
require
pledges
for
the
future
i
can
further
swear
that
i
will
shun
alcohol
i
will
declare
war
upon
the
female
sex
i
will
devote
myself
to
the
encyclopedia
of
agriculture
with
inordinate
unalterable
love
ha
do
you
smell
the
rarified
atmosphere
once
more
farewell
after
i
have
climbed
the
ladder
of
my
hopes
for
the
last
time
i
will
lay
it
to
repose
under
a
wintry
grave
of
pine
branches
when
the
time
comes
may
it
awaken
to
a
new
spring
with
a
kiss
on
your
slim
refreshingly
large
hand
your
much
improved
walter
von
prell
lilly
found
this
letter
the
second
morning
after
the
great
event
in
the
shape
of
a
pellet
stuck
into
the
mouth
of
the
which
leaned
innocently
against
the
jamb
of
the
balcony
door
it
did
not
provide
her
with
unqualified
satisfaction
there
were
turns
of
expression
in
it
which
raised
doubts
as
to
the
sincerity
of
his
conversion
nevertheless
his
asseverations
were
so
plain
and
unmistakable
she
felt
she
might
take
the
core
to
be
sound
it
was
simply
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
his
wanton
way
of
speaking
which
the
person
who
loved
him
would
have
to
acquiesce
in
she
kissed
the
letter
and
stuck
it
in
her
bosom
to
lie
there
warm
and
secure
awhile
before
she
tore
it
up
in
the
afternoon
she
took
a
walk
about
the
grounds
and
actually
found
under
her
balcony
a
long
heap
of
pine
branches
from
between
which
a
few
ladder
rungs
peeped
at
her
familiarly
rejoiced
at
this
token
of
his
pain
she
ran
off
to
the
park
now
soggy
from
the
autumn
rains
and
sauntered
about
marvelling
from
time
to
time
that
renunciation
was
so
easy
after
all
it
was
not
so
easy
she
discovered
it
was
not
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
when
life
began
to
lose
its
content
and
intensity
when
the
hours
jogged
along
in
dreary
autumnal
greyness
and
the
evening
came
and
the
morning
came
without
a
reason
why
moreover
she
failed
to
find
that
support
in
anna
von
schwertfeger
which
she
had
expected
to
although
her
friend
withdrew
none
of
the
promises
she
had
made
yet
a
shadowy
wall
circumscribed
her
which
no
insinuating
love
could
penetrate
she
seemed
almost
to
fear
that
too
great
familiarity
with
lilly
would
bring
down
upon
her
own
head
the
sin
of
the
adulteress
lilly
had
much
to
suffer
from
the
colonel
these
days
she
like
the
rest
now
fell
a
victim
to
his
attacks
of
fury
and
what
was
worse
in
moments
of
quiet
she
would
suddenly
feel
his
dark
lowering
look
fastened
upon
her
betokening
many
a
thought
in
his
mind
which
boded
her
no
good
she
began
to
fear
he
had
gotten
wind
of
her
affair
with
von
prell
but
anna
the
idea
the
symptoms
would
be
rather
different
she
remarked
such
a
suspicion
would
not
pass
without
leaving
a
few
broken
chairs
or
lamps
behind
my
opinion
is
he
feels
bored
at
home
he
hankering
for
the
regiment
and
holds
you
responsible
for
the
change
in
his
life
i
sincerely
hope
he
does
come
to
hate
you
on
that
account
in
that
event
only
two
courses
would
be
open
to
you
separation
or
suicide
here
was
small
comfort
and
no
less
dispiriting
was
his
hesitation
to
introduce
her
to
the
neighbours
long
before
miss
von
schwertfeger
had
declared
lilly
education
complete
no
colonel
wife
or
dame
could
now
find
fault
with
her
manners
but
the
colonel
looked
at
her
distrustfully
and
deferred
the
visits
from
week
to
week
lilly
kept
up
bravely
in
all
her
tribulations
faith
in
herself
and
still
more
faith
in
him
gave
her
peace
and
strength
she
regulated
her
days
strictly
according
to
rule
with
a
fixed
occupation
for
each
hour
she
learned
goethe
poems
by
heart
studied
shakespeare
in
english
read
histories
of
art
and
lost
herself
in
the
mazes
of
the
french
revolution
she
took
special
delight
in
a
large
geographical
work
in
which
there
were
many
pictures
of
southern
ports
tropical
forests
and
bald
rocky
mountain
ranges
there
were
also
full
illustrations
of
italy
pious
pilgrims
on
crusades
enigmatic
churches
and
porticos
which
filled
her
with
an
ardent
longing
to
be
there
when
she
travelled
great
distances
into
strange
countries
and
looked
about
timidly
to
find
her
way
back
again
whom
did
she
see
standing
there
all
of
a
sudden
blond
freckled
in
a
black
and
white
checked
fall
suit
making
deep
reverences
as
my
lady
commands
the
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
her
one
diversion
was
to
stand
behind
her
balcony
door
without
his
knowing
she
was
there
of
course
and
look
over
to
the
lodge
through
the
openings
in
the
vine
the
last
leaves
of
which
fluttered
like
little
red
flags
oh
she
might
be
proud
of
him
when
he
sat
at
the
window
in
his
leisure
hours
he
never
let
himself
be
seen
without
the
encyclopedia
of
agriculture
in
his
hands
he
closed
his
shutters
early
every
evening
in
his
frivolous
days
he
had
hung
heavy
portières
at
the
windows
which
with
the
help
of
the
shutters
prevented
the
tiniest
ray
of
light
from
penetrating
to
the
outside
lilly
doubted
not
in
the
least
that
his
student
lamp
burned
until
late
at
night
while
he
sat
there
over
his
book
copying
valuable
extracts
and
soaring
on
the
pinions
of
great
creative
ideas
she
soared
with
him
she
knew
he
could
not
lose
his
footing
now
she
had
his
vow
and
he
held
her
honour
in
his
keeping
that
would
serve
as
a
talisman
a
guide
on
the
road
leading
upward
to
a
new
life
a
few
weeks
passed
he
begged
to
be
excused
from
coming
to
sunday
dinners
for
which
she
was
grateful
to
him
fortune
had
favoured
her
still
further
by
having
bestowed
a
cold
upon
her
that
fateful
night
as
a
result
of
which
the
physician
forbade
horseback
riding
throughout
the
winter
in
this
miss
von
schwertfeger
probably
had
a
hand
once
on
a
day
early
in
december
the
colonel
as
if
to
spite
his
customary
surliness
appeared
at
dinner
in
high
feather
he
chuckled
to
himself
his
eyes
danced
and
looked
cunning
secret
laughter
as
it
were
ran
down
his
cheeks
in
rivulets
lilly
ventured
to
ask
what
was
amusing
him
at
first
he
refused
to
speak
oh
stuff
and
nonsense
mind
your
own
affairs
but
he
could
not
contain
himself
and
finally
began
well
guess
what
happened
to
me
one
of
the
men
at
the
club
said
to
me
i
better
look
sharp
to
my
prell
because
stories
were
afloat
that
he
kept
knocking
about
in
vile
joints
night
after
night
and
had
even
gotten
mixed
up
in
a
nasty
brawl
on
account
of
a
hussy
of
a
barmaid
lilly
felt
an
icy
numbness
creep
slowly
upward
from
her
feet
her
limbs
grew
rigid
she
smiled
and
the
smile
cut
into
her
cheeks
like
a
stone
at
first
of
course
i
merely
laughed
at
him
because
you
know
there
only
the
one
train
to
take
going
and
coming
and
lately
been
on
that
train
nearly
every
day
no
horse
can
stand
twenty
miles
each
way
night
after
night
and
the
pocket
money
i
give
him
wo
hire
a
special
train
that
what
i
said
to
the
major
but
he
insisted
the
younger
gentlemen
had
told
him
and
it
would
be
a
pity
if
after
all
von
prell
had
to
be
deprived
of
his
uniform
when
i
got
to
the
station
at
one
the
business
was
still
buzzing
about
in
my
head
i
had
a
few
moments
time
so
i
looked
through
the
whole
train
fourth
class
and
all
of
course
not
a
sign
i
did
the
same
thing
three
times
in
succession
well
i
thought
it
a
lie
and
now
listen
yesterday
when
i
was
just
about
to
get
into
the
train
at
this
end
i
remembered
i
had
left
my
umbrella
in
the
carriage
i
ca
get
used
to
that
piece
of
furniture
so
i
went
back
the
platform
was
already
empty
but
the
train
was
still
standing
there
and
when
i
passed
the
baggage
car
sliding
doors
open
i
saw
someone
on
the
opposite
side
jump
out
to
the
tracks
and
scamper
off
i
called
but
he
ran
and
ran
into
the
woods
i
was
going
to
tell
the
baggage
master
who
was
on
the
platform
next
to
the
locomotive
but
prell
flashed
into
my
mind
i
said
to
henry
as
if
the
devil
were
after
you
and
we
reached
here
in
five
minutes
but
then
i
reflected
he
must
have
heard
the
carriage
wheels
from
the
path
so
i
went
up
to
my
room
to
hurry
and
turn
on
the
lights
i
wanted
him
to
think
i
was
in
my
room
already
did
i
wake
you
up
lilly
the
colonel
started
how
you
look
lilly
i
she
said
and
smiled
again
she
has
been
feeling
very
well
all
day
miss
von
schwertfeger
interjected
hastily
besides
your
story
very
exciting
colonel
all
keyed
up
too
hm
he
muttered
twisting
the
end
of
his
black
dyed
moustache
evidently
little
desirous
of
concluding
his
tale
but
lilly
could
not
calm
herself
i
must
know
i
must
know
she
cried
clasping
her
hands
she
was
beside
herself
well
then
said
the
colonel
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
down
i
go
again
in
a
jiffy
in
ambush
in
front
of
the
lodge
there
he
comes
stooping
like
a
polecat
stands
still
eyes
my
window
sees
the
light
aha
he
thinks
all
right
and
just
as
he
about
to
stick
the
key
in
the
lock
i
tackle
him
by
the
collar
lilly
burst
out
into
a
mad
laugh
is
that
funny
is
that
funny
she
cried
this
time
the
colonel
believed
her
something
funnier
coming
he
continued
you
confess
everything
i
said
pardon
you
but
only
on
that
condition
otherwise
you
off
bright
and
early
well
what
do
you
think
the
rascal
was
up
to
the
has
a
lady
love
barmaid
in
the
golden
apple
where
the
sergeants
and
clerks
resort
so
for
the
sake
of
bumming
with
her
he
bribed
a
railroad
official
and
actually
went
to
town
and
came
back
as
a
piece
of
the
king
baggage
night
after
night
rode
in
the
same
train
as
i
did
each
way
if
is
rank
impudence
what
lilly
a
pause
ensued
lilly
experienced
a
sensation
of
swaying
and
reeling
as
if
tossed
on
stormy
seas
a
buzzing
and
singing
at
the
same
time
she
felt
miss
von
schwertfeger
press
her
hand
under
the
table
by
way
of
warning
the
colonel
rose
took
lilly
head
between
his
hands
and
pressing
it
until
she
thought
her
ears
would
split
said
it
seems
you
need
rest
with
that
he
faced
about
and
left
the
room
abruptly
now
gather
your
wits
together
lilly
heard
her
friend
disturbed
voice
behind
her
because
after
this
he
be
on
the
lilly
wanted
to
throw
herself
on
miss
von
schwertfeger
breast
and
be
petted
and
comforted
but
miss
von
schwertfeger
as
if
afraid
somebody
might
catch
her
in
too
intimate
a
conversation
with
lilly
held
herself
aloof
and
said
coolly
though
in
a
friendly
tone
excuse
me
dear
i
have
something
i
must
attend
to
this
minute
with
that
she
too
left
the
room
what
now
lilly
stared
into
space
the
remnants
of
the
precipitate
meal
littered
the
table
the
dark
carved
furniture
cast
rays
from
out
of
the
room
wintry
twilight
the
brass
chandeliers
gleamed
palely
all
was
as
usual
and
yet
nothing
was
there
nothing
but
an
awful
void
an
abyss
which
drew
her
into
its
bosom
with
the
enticements
of
grappling
hooks
and
huge
tongs
she
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
apathetically
the
bare
branches
swayed
in
the
wind
the
ivy
on
the
railing
fluttered
even
the
arched
stalks
of
the
rose
bushes
the
heads
of
which
the
gardener
had
secured
under
heaps
of
earth
trembled
and
quivered
this
way
and
that
the
world
was
writhing
in
the
clutch
of
winter
the
only
still
things
were
the
leaves
lying
on
the
thin
coating
of
snow
which
covered
the
ground
but
the
leaves
were
dead
already
what
now
if
could
happen
then
the
very
earth
beneath
her
feet
gave
way
then
there
was
no
hope
no
rising
to
loftier
heights
no
strength
and
no
fidelity
then
you
might
as
well
throw
yourself
down
beside
the
leaves
out
there
and
die
but
before
that
what
dishes
rattled
behind
her
no
one
had
rung
for
the
maid
but
she
had
come
of
her
own
accord
and
was
helping
ferdinand
clear
the
table
lilly
thought
of
katie
and
that
other
creature
in
whose
arms
he
had
made
mock
of
her
and
her
faith
in
him
she
dragged
her
torpid
legs
up
the
steps
to
the
rooms
where
she
felt
at
home
in
passing
the
colonel
door
she
caught
the
sound
of
his
tread
as
he
fairly
ran
to
and
fro
she
experienced
not
the
faintest
fear
of
him
let
him
run
if
he
wants
to
she
thought
when
in
her
own
room
she
heard
him
give
orders
to
have
the
carriage
brought
around
immediately
for
all
i
care
he
may
stay
here
she
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
the
iciness
benumbing
her
neck
crept
into
her
arms
and
spread
down
to
her
very
finger
tips
there
sat
walter
as
always
in
his
free
time
after
dinner
completely
absorbed
in
the
great
encyclopedia
of
agriculture
so
full
of
zeal
for
study
that
every
now
and
then
he
would
pass
his
hand
through
his
hair
in
a
preoccupied
way
and
without
looking
up
he
had
so
much
time
to
spare
heavens
no
he
would
flick
the
ashes
from
his
cigarette
into
a
flower
pot
in
the
face
of
this
infamous
game
which
he
played
for
the
sole
purpose
of
deceiving
her
lilly
was
seized
by
a
wild
infuriated
desire
to
denounce
him
which
completely
robbed
her
of
her
senses
a
stinging
and
pricking
lifted
her
paralysed
arms
the
iciness
gave
way
to
a
painful
fever
which
throbbed
in
her
temples
and
hung
a
red
curtain
before
her
eyes
she
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
she
rushed
down
the
staircase
tore
open
the
garden
door
leapt
down
the
stone
steps
and
ran
at
full
speed
straight
across
the
lawn
to
the
lodge
whether
someone
spied
her
or
not
she
did
not
care
the
door
to
his
room
banged
against
the
wall
she
had
not
stopped
to
knock
a
rank
pungent
smell
as
in
a
menagerie
assailed
her
nostrils
there
he
was
sitting
at
the
window
he
jumped
to
his
feet
the
grey
daylight
glided
over
his
head
he
had
his
hair
cut
brush
fashion
again
thought
lilly
the
dissolute
life
he
living
demands
it
the
elegance
of
the
dives
demands
it
good
lord
he
said
crumbling
his
burning
cigarette
between
his
fingers
a
pretty
why
why
did
you
she
screamed
at
him
you
a
blackguard
your
word
not
to
be
trusted
you
a
liar
confound
it
he
said
and
looked
about
helplessly
will
my
lady
get
out
of
this
mess
you
broke
your
promise
the
most
sacred
bond
uniting
us
you
you
threw
it
away
on
a
barmaid
a
barmaid
a
creature
who
would
hang
herself
on
anybody
neck
for
a
couple
of
pennies
you
a
vulgar
profligate
you
not
worth
a
woman
having
tried
to
save
you
you
do
to
be
saved
you
to
go
to
the
bad
all
very
good
and
fine
he
said
and
probably
very
saddening
and
incontrovertible
truths
but
will
my
lady
please
explain
how
she
expects
to
get
out
of
here
i
do
know
anything
i
am
more
indifferent
about
she
cried
i
came
for
you
to
give
me
an
account
of
yourself
i
am
asking
you
to
answer
me
immediately
here
now
on
the
spot
certainly
my
lady
i
will
without
fail
but
first
damn
it
hell
get
away
from
the
window
he
cast
a
sharp
glance
at
the
castle
nothing
suspicious
to
be
detected
at
that
moment
at
least
alarmed
by
his
snarling
at
her
in
that
way
lilly
fled
into
the
interior
of
the
room
which
was
low
dark
and
ill
furnished
here
the
vile
animal
smell
was
still
stronger
from
where
it
came
was
made
clear
to
her
the
next
instant
as
she
approached
the
rear
wall
something
suddenly
snapped
at
her
foot
and
two
little
circular
torches
gleamed
up
at
her
wickedly
down
tommy
called
von
prell
while
lilly
recoiled
with
an
exclamation
of
fright
so
that
was
tommy
the
other
member
of
the
triple
alliance
lilly
leaned
against
the
arm
of
the
old
sofa
its
worn
springs
squeaked
under
her
pressure
and
pricked
her
thumbs
and
the
thought
flashed
into
her
mind
what
am
i
doing
here
what
is
it
all
to
me
von
prell
the
while
stepped
from
door
to
door
listening
if
that
old
leichtweg
had
happened
to
be
in
the
next
room
he
said
we
should
be
dying
a
dog
death
but
if
you
go
this
instant
the
front
way
into
the
courtyard
they
might
suppose
you
had
come
to
ask
something
and
perhaps
we
can
patch
it
up
still
all
lilly
perceived
in
his
words
was
a
sly
attempt
at
evasion
and
a
fresh
flood
of
indignation
overwhelmed
her
first
justify
yourself
she
cried
until
you
do
i
wo
go
this
way
or
that
way
or
the
other
way
to
enforce
her
resolve
she
dropped
down
on
the
screeching
sofa
which
was
covered
with
a
dirty
grey
horseblanket
folded
into
several
thicknesses
for
protection
against
the
sharp
points
of
the
springs
he
was
compelled
to
yield
very
well
then
look
here
a
fellow
a
human
being
is
he
and
if
he
given
the
in
that
common
way
common
way
faltered
lilly
what
was
common
in
my
letter
did
i
tear
my
heart
out
and
throw
it
at
your
feet
and
did
miss
von
schwertfeger
she
could
not
continue
wrath
and
despair
choked
her
utterance
in
the
meantime
von
prell
who
at
first
had
been
at
a
complete
loss
arrived
at
the
proper
policy
to
adopt
yes
that
just
it
he
said
growing
more
aggrieved
with
each
word
is
a
love
like
ours
to
be
concluded
with
a
lukewarm
homily
and
that
schwertfeger
did
i
deserve
being
dismissed
by
you
like
an
asthmatic
old
dog
through
the
intermediation
of
a
third
person
a
horrid
disgusting
creature
is
it
enough
to
make
a
man
desperate
after
all
he
done
for
you
what
did
you
do
for
me
queried
lilly
well
was
i
a
comrade
the
whole
time
was
i
disloyal
even
to
my
old
colonel
for
your
sake
that
fine
old
gentleman
who
saved
my
life
you
might
say
you
see
all
that
no
small
matter
do
you
suppose
it
did
cut
me
to
the
quick
do
you
suppose
i
get
the
blues
and
then
to
be
fooling
round
here
alone
night
after
night
with
that
that
tommy
the
beast
smells
i
tell
you
so
why
not
try
to
dull
one
feelings
should
i
how
shall
i
say
deaden
the
anguish
of
lost
love
not
even
deaden
it
it
a
perfect
mystery
to
me
how
you
can
demand
such
a
thing
of
me
we
speak
different
languages
my
dear
child
there
a
yawning
chasm
dividing
our
natures
and
even
willing
to
risk
our
two
lives
for
such
mummery
as
a
rule
an
old
aunt
but
indeed
if
only
i
had
you
out
of
this
place
throughout
this
long
speech
he
had
walked
about
lilly
in
a
semicircle
with
one
hand
thrust
in
the
belt
of
his
norfolk
jacket
making
short
jerky
steps
which
forcefully
expressed
his
righteous
indignation
lilly
sat
on
the
sofa
stiffly
upright
mechanically
turning
her
head
after
him
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
and
staring
at
him
with
great
uncomprehending
eyes
when
he
stopped
speaking
he
drew
a
cigarette
from
the
case
and
energetically
beat
off
the
superfluous
tobacco
with
the
index
finger
of
his
left
hand
lilly
rose
in
all
her
height
leaving
the
sofa
and
the
table
next
to
the
sofa
far
below
her
listen
walter
she
said
from
this
moment
everything
between
us
is
at
an
end
why
was
it
long
ago
i
mean
inwardly
too
oh
inwardly
too
he
made
a
little
grimace
with
you
that
probably
means
if
you
have
something
in
your
stomach
when
lilly
saw
her
love
so
ridiculed
and
mutilated
she
could
no
longer
restrain
herself
with
an
outcry
she
ran
from
the
sofa
and
hid
her
face
anywhere
at
all
on
the
wall
next
to
the
window
get
away
from
the
window
she
heard
him
hiss
oh
what
did
she
care
in
the
extremity
of
his
fright
he
took
to
pleading
just
come
away
from
the
window
he
said
it
was
all
mere
twaddle
i
simply
wanted
to
make
you
laugh
again
nothing
more
please
come
away
from
the
window
she
did
not
budge
to
crawl
off
somewhere
to
crawl
away
and
hide
herself
and
all
her
shame
she
felt
his
hands
seize
her
rudely
that
too
to
suffer
violence
too
she
flung
him
off
wrestled
with
him
clawed
at
his
neck
and
suddenly
a
whistling
a
clash
and
clatter
shivers
of
glass
flew
over
their
heads
and
a
long
dark
something
like
the
shaft
of
a
lance
sped
past
them
knocked
against
something
rebounded
and
fell
at
their
feet
the
same
instant
lilly
felt
a
rush
of
cold
air
on
her
forehead
which
aroused
her
from
the
stupefaction
of
surprise
one
of
the
two
upper
window
panes
had
been
broken
no
living
creature
was
to
be
seen
but
the
balcony
door
yonder
which
had
been
closed
a
moment
before
now
showed
a
dark
opening
and
was
swinging
shut
a
narrow
escape
murmured
walter
and
stooped
to
pick
up
the
mysterious
thing
from
the
floor
while
the
fragments
of
glass
gritted
beneath
his
feet
the
lilly
faltered
a
mercy
he
did
happen
to
have
his
at
hand
said
walter
else
we
be
riddled
into
sieves
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
wiped
away
the
sweat
of
fright
standing
on
his
forehead
in
bright
beads
none
the
less
he
was
a
brave
little
chap
and
knew
on
the
instant
what
to
do
he
sprang
to
the
wardrobe
under
which
tommy
had
burrowed
fetched
out
his
army
revolver
and
tested
all
its
parts
then
he
said
now
please
go
into
leichtweg
room
and
lock
yourself
in
the
colonel
simply
gone
to
load
his
gun
then
he
be
here
but
lilly
refused
her
wrath
against
him
had
completely
evaporated
let
me
stay
with
you
let
me
stay
with
you
she
begged
clasping
his
shoulders
impossible
child
he
replied
with
the
old
masterful
lift
to
his
brows
what
coming
is
men
business
then
i
stand
out
in
the
hall
and
receive
him
at
your
door
he
bit
his
lips
well
he
said
if
you
take
it
that
way
i
ca
help
myself
sit
down
please
he
removed
the
key
from
the
outside
of
the
door
stuck
it
in
the
lock
on
the
inside
and
cautiously
turned
it
several
times
between
loading
and
shooting
he
said
then
there
a
great
big
difference
but
the
devil
knows
he
took
out
his
watch
and
listened
intently
for
sounds
from
the
outside
while
he
counted
a
half
one
one
and
a
half
two
probably
ca
find
his
cartridges
then
commandingly
do
sit
down
you
need
your
legs
lilly
sank
in
one
corner
of
the
sofa
and
he
seated
himself
in
the
other
placing
the
watch
between
them
on
the
bumpy
seat
both
counted
now
with
their
eyes
fastened
on
the
second
hand
two
and
a
half
three
three
and
a
half
four
four
and
a
half
five
minutes
not
a
sound
save
the
wind
howling
in
the
bare
branches
then
it
seemed
to
them
they
heard
the
trot
of
horses
starting
in
the
courtyard
and
dying
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
gates
whom
he
gone
to
fetch
asked
walter
we
not
ready
for
seconds
yet
red
suns
danced
before
lilly
eyes
the
ceiling
began
to
rise
and
sink
walter
kept
on
counting
seven
eight
eight
and
a
half
nothing
nine
nine
and
a
half
ten
suddenly
he
emitted
a
faint
whistle
and
grasped
his
revolver
the
front
door
grated
on
its
hinges
steps
resounded
but
not
the
threatening
thundering
steps
of
a
vengeful
husband
they
were
soft
hesitating
dragging
steps
then
for
a
while
nothing
again
no
sound
except
the
breathing
of
two
persons
and
someone
else
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
it
seemed
who
there
called
walter
now
came
a
knock
soft
broken
as
if
of
trembling
failing
fingers
who
there
in
the
devil
name
he
called
again
anna
von
schwertfeger
he
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
there
she
stood
red
about
the
mouth
her
lids
quivering
the
colonel
has
just
driven
off
to
baron
von
platow
he
will
return
in
three
hours
he
charged
me
to
tell
you
lilly
that
when
he
comes
back
he
does
want
to
find
you
on
his
premises
and
what
did
he
charge
you
to
tell
me
sneered
walter
von
prell
miss
von
schwertfeger
without
regarding
him
took
lilly
hand
come
you
have
much
time
we
must
pack
but
but
where
am
i
to
go
she
asked
helplessly
suffering
herself
to
be
drawn
to
her
feet
when
she
got
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
she
saw
the
carriage
that
was
to
convey
her
from
the
castle
already
rolling
up
the
driveway
part
ii
chapter
i
she
was
lilly
czepanek
again
in
the
divorce
proceedings
there
had
been
no
attempt
at
dissimulation
or
concealment
and
the
case
moved
along
rapidly
lilly
alone
was
found
guilty
and
upon
the
colonel
deposition
was
deprived
of
the
right
to
use
her
married
name
there
is
nothing
to
be
saved
from
the
ruins
wrote
pieper
except
the
jewels
which
i
hope
you
diligently
accumulated
by
following
my
advice
and
standing
in
front
of
fine
the
pearl
necklace
your
put
about
your
neck
on
your
wedding
day
owing
in
part
i
may
now
say
to
my
suggestion
which
i
will
try
to
get
back
for
you
is
in
itself
sufficient
to
keep
your
head
above
water
several
years
the
result
of
this
letter
was
that
lilly
took
the
pearl
necklace
which
after
her
flight
she
had
found
in
one
of
her
trunks
among
the
laces
and
evening
gowns
carried
it
to
a
jeweller
had
him
pack
it
up
and
addressed
it
to
miss
von
schwertfeger
she
felt
justified
in
considering
the
less
valuable
trinkets
to
be
her
personal
property
she
had
already
disposed
of
a
considerable
number
of
them
and
what
was
left
would
scarcely
suffice
for
more
than
half
a
year
then
poverty
but
her
material
condition
gave
her
little
concern
her
regret
for
what
she
had
lost
was
too
profound
her
consciousness
of
the
shame
she
had
undergone
too
lively
but
that
her
future
should
not
have
been
hidden
from
her
perceptions
behind
a
veil
of
tears
yes
tears
tears
oh
she
learned
to
shed
tears
she
learned
to
swallow
tears
like
salt
sea
water
she
sucked
them
into
her
mouth
with
her
lower
lip
thrust
out
she
shook
them
from
her
cheeks
like
drops
of
rain
and
they
kept
welling
up
again
finally
without
cause
even
after
the
pain
had
subsided
awake
or
asleep
they
just
came
she
had
gone
away
that
grey
windy
december
day
just
before
nightfall
in
a
trembling
state
of
stupefaction
without
complaint
without
attempts
at
gone
away
blindly
anywhere
simply
gone
away
in
all
haste
she
landed
in
berlin
the
haven
of
all
the
wrecked
in
that
world
where
oblivion
spreads
its
blessing
hands
alike
over
the
righteous
and
unrighteous
where
enticing
possibilities
flash
and
sparkle
illuminating
the
dark
days
of
inertness
and
prostration
where
regret
over
a
lost
past
by
and
by
becomes
tense
desirous
expectation
of
happiness
and
where
the
god
chance
reigns
supreme
in
that
world
of
the
unknown
and
forsaken
in
which
none
but
those
who
are
both
old
and
poor
sink
into
nothingness
hopeless
outlaws
into
that
world
lilly
crept
many
a
dreary
month
she
knocked
about
in
lodging
houses
where
divorcées
with
lost
reputations
huddle
together
reminding
one
of
little
heaps
of
decaying
apples
where
the
tone
is
given
by
chilian
attachés
and
agents
of
mysterious
trades
from
bucharest
and
alexandria
in
a
friendly
way
she
avoided
the
confidences
of
companions
in
misery
who
lavished
words
of
comfort
and
with
mute
disregard
repelled
the
advances
physical
advances
as
well
of
her
enterprising
neighbours
after
a
while
she
began
to
look
about
for
a
position
something
unique
something
between
a
lady
in
waiting
and
a
chaperon
which
would
not
be
incongruous
with
her
former
station
and
the
quiet
dignity
of
her
bearing
but
positions
of
that
sort
seemed
remarkably
scarce
and
all
she
reaped
of
her
endeavours
were
the
tender
attentions
of
a
few
old
gentlemen
who
came
to
see
her
in
the
evening
and
could
not
find
their
way
out
again
until
the
door
was
held
wide
open
for
them
discouraged
she
gave
up
going
to
employment
bureaus
and
the
useless
ringing
of
front
door
bells
but
her
expectations
had
not
yet
sunk
to
the
level
of
those
of
a
or
model
in
a
dressmaking
establishment
and
they
never
would
sink
so
low
because
wife
as
she
was
branded
no
matter
where
she
went
was
written
all
over
her
in
that
seething
sea
of
humanity
she
tossed
about
without
so
much
as
a
straw
to
clutch
at
except
indeed
walter
letter
which
miss
von
schwertfeger
forwarded
to
her
two
months
after
her
expulsion
the
poor
boy
was
now
completely
ruined
nevertheless
his
letter
gave
proof
of
a
modest
attempt
to
offer
her
some
support
dearest
friend
i
done
for
i
been
shot
a
mere
trifle
when
it
happens
to
others
but
when
it
happens
to
oneself
the
consequence
is
it
considerably
lessens
one
hopes
of
entering
upon
a
glorious
career
as
head
waiter
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
nevertheless
i
thank
fate
for
having
been
gracious
enough
to
lead
across
my
path
so
good
so
touching
a
lamb
one
so
filled
with
the
desire
to
redeem
as
my
baronissima
you
will
readily
understand
o
dearest
supergracious
woman
that
i
in
turn
also
feel
a
slight
obligation
to
play
the
redeemer
if
only
to
preserve
our
souls
for
each
other
but
the
how
presents
some
difficulties
to
be
sure
if
i
were
to
recommend
you
to
the
care
of
my
former
friends
your
future
would
be
settled
for
in
blissful
hours
leaves
and
virtues
still
fall
therefore
i
descend
a
step
to
those
regions
in
which
a
sturdy
philistinism
creeps
on
its
belly
before
our
coronets
even
when
those
coronets
lie
shattered
on
the
ground
in
alte
jakobstrasse
in
berlin
there
dwells
a
respectable
manufacturer
of
bronze
ware
a
comrade
of
the
reserves
by
name
richard
dehnicke
who
feels
he
is
indebted
to
me
because
i
pumped
him
for
coin
i
am
writing
to
him
by
this
mail
step
boldly
in
among
his
lamps
and
vases
the
former
i
hope
will
brighten
your
nights
the
latter
daintily
line
your
way
in
life
and
he
will
not
ask
the
price
which
it
is
the
custom
in
our
country
to
demand
of
beautiful
women
some
queer
fish
there
have
to
be

i
planted
a
ball
in
his
forehead
this
letter
the
last
and
only
greeting
from
her
friend
left
lilly
untouched
soon
after
miss
von
schwertfeger
wrote
he
set
sail
for
the
united
states
with
a
crippled
arm
their
love
had
deserved
an
honourable
burial
even
if
its
rapture
had
not
been
genuine
even
if
its
lofty
purpose
had
set
in
dirt
and
disgrace
if
only
to
preserve
our
souls
for
each
other
he
had
written
the
dear
little
fellow
the
letter
however
offered
a
certain
guarantee
that
in
her
hour
of
need
a
helping
hand
would
be
stretched
out
to
steady
her
but
the
measure
he
recommended
she
never
never
thought
of
adopting
what
she
feared
above
all
was
that
something
which
emanated
from
the
eyes
of
men
fixed
upon
her
face
in
desire
that
something
which
issued
from
lips
persuasively
masterfully
she
wanted
to
keep
her
fate
in
her
own
hands
and
go
her
own
way
what
that
way
was
to
be
she
had
not
yet
determined
so
irresolute
had
sorrow
and
anxiety
made
her
that
nothing
but
a
faint
breeze
would
have
been
required
to
head
her
life
in
a
certain
direction
but
no
breeze
blew
upon
her
months
passed
miss
von
schwertfeger
ceased
to
write
lilly
money
gave
out
the
little
treasure
of
trinkets
dwindled
rapidly
the
lodging
houses
to
which
she
moved
grew
ever
more
modest
chilian
attachés
and
greek
trafficers
were
replaced
by
bankrupt
real
estate
agents
and
unemployed
bank
clerks
who
wanted
to
solace
her
in
her
loneliness
by
spending
the
evenings
with
her
and
the
women
who
came
in
soiled
kimonos
to
pay
her
neighbourly
visits
cast
greedy
glances
at
the
few
brooches
bracelets
and
rings
she
still
had
left
so
lilly
determined
to
make
an
end
of
this
life
chapter
ii
one
of
the
best
of
the
best
rooms
in

which
are
to
be

in

renowned

days
and
which

young

including
service
and
breakfast
was
to

from
the
widow

laue
it
contained
red
plush
furniture
which
embodied
the
acme
of
good
taste
at
the
time
of
the
war
it
contained
a
pier
glass
fantastically
stuck
from
top
to
bottom
with
new
year
cards
cards
of
congratulation
and
illustrated
advertisements
of
soaps
and
powders
it
contained
photographs
on
the
walls
of
actors
once
famous
whose
fame
in
the
meantime
had
faded
no
less
than
the
autographs
they
had
written
beneath
their
pictures
it
contained
a
washstand
whose
marble
top
was
covered
with
a
tidy
embroidered
with
the
sententious
couplet
to
keep
your
body
clean

to
have
your
conscience
just
as
pure

contained
photograph

a

in
the
shape
of
a
windmill
of
olive

and
a

modestly
hidden
behind
blue
woolen
portières
it
contained
finally
hung
over
the
sofa
in
a
glass
case
a
mysterious
round
creation
the
thing
consisted
of
six
strips
of
paper
braided
together
and
radiating
from
a
common
centre
it
was
covered
with
gauze
beneath
which
the
outline
of
pressed
flowers
could
dimly
be
distinguished
it
was
in
this
best
room
on
neanderstrasse
four
flights
up
over
a
china
shop
a
establishment
and
a
repair
studio
from
the
windows
of
which
room
an
oblique
view
was
to
be
obtained
of
the
greenish
grey
waves
of
the
engelbecken
and
into
which
a
broad
expanse
of
genuine
berlin
smoky
sky
actually
shone
that
lilly
one
day
landed
laue
was
a
woman
of
fifty
worn
out
by
overwork
with
a
face
like
a
dried
apple
and
great
staring
tearful
eyes
she
circled
about
lilly
in
incredulous
admiration
as
if
unable
to
comprehend
that
so
much
brilliance
and
beauty
had
strayed
into
her
home
the
very
day
of
her
arrival
lilly
was
informed
of
her
history
her
husband
had
been
cashier
and
bookkeeper
at
one
of
the
favorite
variety
theatres
in
berlin
and
twenty
years
before
had
departed
this
world
leaving
her
without
home
or
protection
there
was
no
rosy
glamour
to
glorify
tears
wept
in
solitude
no
comic
songs
to
drown
the
cry
of
hunger
here
that
mysterious
round
creation
which
on
closer
inspection
proved
to
be
a
lamp
shade
came
to
her
rescue
it
had
been
presented
to
her
by
an
artistic
friend
and
it
occurred
to
her
to
use
it
as
a
model
for
making
others
to
sell
after
peddling
her
wares
about
for
years
after
long
drudgery
and
disenchantments
of
all
sorts
she
at
last
conquered
a
market
for
her
lamp
shades
and
won
for
herself
a
name
as
specialist
in
her
field
in
her
back
room
with
one
window
which
smelled
of
hay
and
paste
and
where
hundreds
of
dried
flowers
lay
on
a
long
white
deal
table
she
herself
did
not
gather
them
of
course
for
lack
of
time
she
had
worked
for
nearly
two
decades
tapping
daubing
pasting
drying
threading
and
weaving
sixteen
hours
a
day
and
had
earned
thanks
to
her
renown
as
a
specialist
so
much
that
she
was
compelled
to
rent
her
best
room
her
treasure
chamber
her
sanctuary
to
a
stranger
for
thirty
marks
a
month
lilly
and
laue
it
is
true
did
not
remain
strangers
into
the
existence
of
this
being
in
whose
eyes
a
few
betinseled
were
paragons
of
beauty
the
embodiment
of
unattainable
splendour
lilly
descended
from
the
world
of
genuine
aristocracy
as
from
heavenly
heights
her
hostess
idolised
her
because
she
saw
in
her
a
messenger
from
that
wholly
improbable
land
which
exists
only
in
novels
and
in
which
words
like
lackey
and
and
pearl
necklace
lilly
soon
told
laue
of
hers
and
other
such
things
as
one
allows
to
melt
on
one
tongue
with
eyes
are
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
laue
immediately
became
lilly
confidante
and
counsellor
she
helped
her
overcome
the
shame
consequent
upon
the
divorce
trial
she
encouraged
her
when
the
feeling
of
being
lost
unnerved
her
and
she
held
before
her
eyes
the
prospect
of
a
radiant
future
in
great
powerful
berlin
nobody
need
succumb
every
day
a
dozen
lucky
chances
might
occur
to
help
one
to
one
feet
there
were
lonely
old
ladies
who
were
desperately
seeking
heiresses
for
their
fortunes
there
were
noble
young
women
who
disgusted
with
the
artificiality
of
their
surroundings
helplessly
yearned
to
reach
out
the
hand
of
companionship
to
a
beautiful
poor
orphan
there
were
celebrated
artists
who
sought
to
escape
the
snares
of
lewd
women
in
the
arms
of
a
pure
love
there
were
great
poets
with
whom
the
position
of
muse
had
become
vacant
the
whole
city
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
lilly
coming
to
lift
her
jubilantly
to
the
throne
of
mistress
more
months
passed
regret
for
her
squandered
life
gradually
lost
its
edge
her
nights
became
calmer
she
no
longer
started
out
of
a
drowse
with
a
cry
because
some
picture
of
her
paradise
lost
stood
before
her
with
horrible
vividness
but
one
thing
she
did
not
learn
to
consider
the
brief
span
during
which
she
had
wandered
on
the
heights
as
a
mere
episode
that
had
interrupted
her
true
modest
life
like
a
caprice
a
dream
in
her
consciousness
she
was
and
remained
a
sort
of
enchanted
princess
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
until
it
pleased
providence
to
reinstate
her
in
her
own
she
solicitously
cherished
everything
reminding
her
of
her
vanished
glory
the
gala
robes
the
colonel
had
had
made
for
her
in
dresden
hung
in
laue
wardrobe
her
underwear
embroidered
with
the
coronet
filled
laue
empty
drawers
with
their
delicacy
and
in
a
long
row
in
front
of
the
tall
mirror
in
best
room
lay
the
superb
toilet
articles
of
ivory
and
gold
which
had
once
been
the
pride
of
her
boudoir
these
too
still
bore
the
coronet
lilly
would
have
considered
it
an
outrage
upon
her
most
sacred
rights
had
she
had
to
part
with
them
and
all
the
time
she
awaited
the
future
she
still
studied
advertisements
and
wrote
letters
applying
for
positions
but
the
advertisements
were
usually
forgotten
and
the
letters
seldom
mailed
however
feeling
the
need
of
occupation
and
companionship
she
got
into
the
habit
of
sitting
with
laue
in
the
back
room
and
helping
her
with
her
work
soon
she
too
was
tapping
pasting
daubing
threading
and
weaving
just
like
her
teacher
having
inherited
taste
and
talent
for
everything
artistic
she
soon
outstripped
laue
after
having
sold
the
shades
laue
would
relate
without
envy
how
the
patterns
she
designed
and
set
together
were
instantly
recognised
and
preferred
lilly
ambition
was
aroused
she
strove
to
create
works
of
art
she
could
not
toil
enough
if
you
would
fool
such
a
time
over
every
little
spray
was
laue
criticism
you
would
make
more
money
than
i
do
after
each
transaction
laue
honestly
settled
accounts
with
lilly
but
lilly
was
satisfied
with
the
forty
or
fifty
marks
a
month
that
her
work
brought
in
her
newly
aroused
fancy
flew
toward
higher
goals
the
dried
grasses
the
grass
flowers
as
laue
called
them
charmed
her
especially
their
slender
aspiring
stalks
the
delicate
grace
of
their
branchings
the
weary
mourning
of
their
hanging
sprays
caused
them
to
resemble
tiny
trees
weeping
willows
at
the
edge
of
a
brook
inclining
over
marble
urns
or
palms
longingly
rooted
on
parched
rocks
lilly
dreamed
of
a
new
sort
of
art
paintings
on
transparent
glass
with
foregrounds
of
dried
grass
lamp
shades
and
window
shades
on
which
woods
of
flowering
grass
and
ferns
charmingly
shaded
pasteboard
houses
standing
out
in
relief
with
their
windows
cut
out
to
let
light
shine
as
if
from
within
fleecy
clouds
glowing
sunsets
ridges
of
hills
in
hazy
outline
and
dark
blue
rivers
across
which
the
moon
threw
swaying
bridges
of
light
an
endless
succession
of
pictures
suddenly
took
form
in
lilly
mind
and
new
ones
kept
coming
and
coming
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
all
that
wealth
of
imagery
laue
who
for
twenty
years
had
unswervingly
stuck
to
pasting
her
oiled
paper
and
felt
that
every
desire
to
abandon
her
modest
work
was
heretical
warned
lilly
with
all
her
might
but
lilly
was
possessed
and
one
day
she
resorted
to
extreme
measures
she
took
her
brooch
set
with
six
small
emeralds
to
the
jeweler
who
gave
her
eighty
marks
it
was
worth
five
times
as
much
of
course
she
used
the
money
to
buy
polished
plates
which
were
held
together
in
pairs
by
brass
screws
and
could
be
hung
at
the
window
by
dainty
chains
she
also
purchased
a
box
of
paints
and
while
laue
clasped
her
hands
in
dismay
she
set
to
painting
bravely
but
her
skill
which
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
some
recollections
of
lessons
at
high
school
failed
her
utterly
the
colors
ran
together
and
the
woods
in
the
foreground
which
had
significance
and
value
only
in
conjunction
with
the
painted
landscape
remained
nothing
but
fern
leaves
and
grass
blades
rooted
in
nothingness
lilly
agonised
a
long
time
finally
shedding
hot
tears
she
threw
all
the
stuff
into
a
corner
and
ruefully
returned
to
her
lamp
shades
she
again
took
to
pasting
oiled
paper
wings
and
weaving
six
of
them
together
with
white
silk
ribbons
laue
who
during
the
weeks
of
lilly
truancy
had
maintained
glum
silence
took
again
to
depicting
seductive
futures
all
the
fancies
that
had
been
held
fast
in
her
poor
brain
for
twenty
long
years
were
set
free
now
that
she
herself
had
nothing
to
hope
for
and
were
laid
in
lilly
outstretched
hands
as
for
lilly
she
continued
to
listen
greedily
but
a
feeling
began
to
oppress
her
soul
that
as
her
life
went
on
that
which
she
called
life
she
was
sinking
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
but
deeper
deeper
every
day
into
this
dark
sorry
existence
and
she
was
tormented
by
a
horror
of
her
landlady
of
that
limited
human
being
in
whose
great
watery
eyes
a
hopeless
desire
for
life
attractions
still
shone
although
her
lamp
shades
had
brought
her
nearly
to
the
edge
of
the
grave
this
horror
often
came
upon
lilly
so
powerfully
that
she
had
to
run
out
of
doors
no
matter
where
out
into
the
world
into
the
arms
of
life
before
an
hour
had
elapsed
she
was
back
again
the
streets
frightened
her
the
painted
prostitutes
who
brushed
her
shoulders
the
young
fellows
hunting
for
game
who
trotted
behind
her
the
unconcerned
brazenness
with
which
each
and
every
one
elbowed
his
way
all
this
filled
her
with
apprehension
and
made
a
coward
of
her
a
dim
feeling
told
her
she
would
never
again
be
equal
to
that
lusty
independence
which
takes
pleasure
in
fight
she
seemed
to
herself
a
helpless
cripple
when
she
remembered
the
poor
who
in
cozy
security
performed
her
duties
among
asmussen
old
volumes
and
felt
she
was
in
the
right
even
when
she
lied
and
deceived
and
was
beaten
and
obviously
was
in
the
wrong
then
the
waiting
the
waiting
the
waiting
for
what
she
herself
did
not
know
but
something
to
come
her
life
not
end
here
among
those
bits
of
oiled
paper
from
time
to
time
the
thought
of
the
rich
bronze
manufacturer
to
whom
walter
had
recommended
her
rose
to
the
surface
of
her
soul
as
a
vague
craving
but
the
fervor
with
which
she
clung
to
this
shadow
terrified
her
and
she
instantly
chased
it
from
her
mind
a
year
had
passed
since
walter
letter
had
been
written
it
was
much
too
late
to
seek
help
from
him
so
she
waited
a
few
months
more
sometimes
when
her
glance
fell
on
the
mirror
while
she
was
undressing
and
she
beheld
the
image
of
a
human
being
consecrated
by
beauty
round
slim
with
yearning
eyes
and
a
mouth
ripened
by
kisses
glad
astonishment
seized
her
at
the
thought
is
that
myself
and
she
was
overcome
by
a
transport
compounded
of
consciousness
of
her
youth
and
readiness
for
love
the
world
was
there
just
to
press
her
to
its
heart
then
even
that
dingy
existence
became
a
blessing
because
it
keyed
up
her
energies
to
intoxication
and
flight
and
at
twilight
when
she
stretched
herself
on
the
sofa
in
a
brief
moment
of
leisure
and
saw
the
blue
flash
of
the
electric
tram
flit
across
the
ceiling
dreams
came
gently
gliding
upon
her
resolving
that
burning
expectancy
into
soft
desires
a
feeling
that
she
had
been
saved
stole
over
her
soul
like
a
thanksgiving
and
that
which
she
usually
bewailed
as
lost
happiness
became
nothing
more
than
a
nightmare
from
which
a
benign
destiny
had
freed
her
but
such
hours
were
rare
and
they
resembled
the
solacing
mirage
that
arises
before
the
eyes
of
the
thirsty
traveller
rather
than
the
drink
itself
the
winter
passed
in
fog
and
rain
now
came
the
mild
march
evenings
when
rosy
clouds
floated
like
blossoms
over
the
house
tops
then
came
spring
itself
the
freshly
trimmed
little
trees
on
the
open
places
put
forth
brownish
green
buds
which
by
degrees
turned
into
pale
bunches
of
leaves
lilly
saw
as
little
of
all
that
glad
bourgeoning
that
snowy
florescence
of
cherry
trees
that
brilliant
glow
of
the
hawthorne
as
when
she
dusted
the
yellow
powder
from
asmussen
bookcases
laue
did
not
like
taking
walks
to
her
the
idea
of
passing
a
meadow
without
gathering
flowers
or
a
garden
without
thrusting
her
hand
between
the
rails
was
inconceivable
and
she
feared
being
caught
in
the
act
an
experience
she
had
often
had
lilly
for
her
part
would
not
venture
out
alone
dreading
the
unrestrained
crowd
then
came
those
hot
hazy
oppressive
sunday
afternoons
when
endless
throngs
stream
from
the
city
to
the
suburbs
when
the
streets
lie
stretched
out
dead
in
all
their
length
and
when
the
overcast
heavens
fairly
weigh
upon
those
who
have
been
left
to
pant
between
the
walls
of
the
houses
on
those
afternoons
laue
would
stick
genuine
rhinestone
studs
into
her
ears
would
don
a
brown
velvet
dress
with
a
black
jet
collar
on
the
neck
and
in
this
costume
would
pay
lilly
a
formal
visit
in
the
best
room
the
dresden
gowns
would
be
taken
from
the
wardrobe
and
carefully
compared
with
the
gorgeous
dresses
worn
by
the
charming
ladies
of
the
proscenium
box
years
before
the
faded
pictures
of
stars
would
be
fetched
down
from
the
walls
and
examined
as
to
their
charms
exciting
tales
would
be
told
of
their
own
adventures
in
which
amid
blithe
sinning
marital
fidelity
asserted
its
modest
worth
the
afternoon
would
decline
pale
and
perspiring
as
a
fever
patient
a
hot
breeze
would
blow
in
through
the
window
the
varnish
of
the
rosewood
furniture
would
reek
the
walls
of
the
houses
opposite
would
shine
as
if
polished
with
wax
and
laue
munching
her
cheese
cake
would
again
repeat
the
tale
of
her
stale
virtues
when
at
last
she
took
leave
lilly
would
groan
and
sink
on
her
bed
burying
her
face
in
the
pillows
from
without
she
would
hear
the
shouts
of
the
returning
from
the
country
the
next
morning
the
pasting
of
flowers
would
begin
anew
july
came
she
could
no
longer
endure
it
one
monday
while
she
was
lying
in
bed
and
early
dawn
found
her
still
awake
still
waiting
her
pillow
wet
with
tears
the
desire
for
life
suddenly
gripped
her
heart
so
strongly
that
she
jumped
from
bed
with
an
outcry
a
jubilant
exclamation
and
finally
determined
i
will
do
it
i
will
take
the
difficult
step
and
go
on
a
begging
pilgrimage
to
that
strange
man
but
no
mercy
no
beg
she
would
not
beg
oh
she
had
long
before
carefully
arranged
all
that
she
would
merely
ask
for
a
bit
of
advice
which
an
experienced
connoisseur
of
arts
and
crafts
could
easily
give
without
sacrificing
more
than
five
minutes
of
his
business
time
she
would
simply
find
out
from
him
how
and
where
she
could
learn
whatever
his
answer
the
foundations
of
a
new
life
would
have
been
laid
chapter
iii
was
it
a
path
of
destiny
the
street
wore
its
usual
appearance
truck
waggons
rattled
along
women
doing
their
marketing
crowded
in
front
of
the
provision
shops
young
men
hastening
by
with
portfolios
or
books
in
their
arms
found
time
to
turn
and
look
after
her
lilly
perceived
this
as
always
with
a
sense
partly
of
satisfaction
partly
of
chagrin
was
it
a
path
of
destiny
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
as
she
walked
along
said
to
her
yes
she
felt
she
was
going
to
market
to
sell
herself
herself
everything
left
of
herself
her
bit
of
pride
her
bit
of
freedom
her
faith
that
she
was
one
of
the
elect
her
faith
in
the
miracle
that
some
day
was
to
be
accomplished
in
her
behalf
the
walk
lasted
nearly
an
hour
she
lost
her
way
she
asked
the
policemen
she
stood
in
front
of
shop
windows
to
look
at
her
reflection
she
was
afraid
of
not
pleasing
and
each
time
she
saw
the
soft
slim
contour
of
her
tall
figure
with
its
air
of
pleasant
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
when
she
read
the
name
of
the
street
where
he
dwelt
she
started
in
fright
she
had
secretly
hoped
she
would
not
find
it
and
would
have
to
return
after
all
his
house
presented
nothing
remarkable
a
grey
structure
with
a
broad
unadorned
square
carriage
entrance
across
the
full
width
of
which
was
a
scaffolding
liebert
dehnicke
manufacturers
of
metal
wares
was
inscribed
in
gold
characters
on
an
enormous
iron
plate
stretching
along
half
the
front
of
the
house
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
she
scrutinised
every
detail
still
oppressed
by
the
question
whether
she
had
not
better
turn
back
the
second
story
windows
were
closely
hung
with
dainty
écru
lace
curtains
on
the
sills
were
snowy
white
porcelain
pots
filled
with
geraniums
and
marigolds
that
part
of
the
house
looked
better
kept
and
more
prosperous
than
everything
round
about
that
probably
where
he
lives
she
thought
and
felt
a
slight
dread
in
the
face
of
so
much
serene
yet
severe
beauty
then
she
took
heart
crossed
the
street
and
made
straight
for
the
door
with
iron
grill
work
which
was
next
to
the
carriage
entrance
and
seemed
to
lead
up
to
that
second
story
but
the
door
was
locked
and
before
ringing
she
peeped
through
the
grating
she
saw
a
dark
staircase
solemnly
lined
with
cypress
trees
and
laurel
bushes
in
the
background
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
a
window
glowing
blue
and
red
and
throwing
rainbow
colors
on
a
white
bust
in
front
of
it
lilly
recognized
the
bust
having
seen
it
in
the
display
windows
of
the
art
shops
it
was
clytie
whom
she
had
always
loved
because
of
her
gentle
melancholy
as
she
looked
upon
all
this
her
heart
sank
again
she
seemed
to
herself
totally
unworthy
to
step
into
those
formal
peaceful
regions
so
she
descended
the
three
door
steps
and
entered
the
profaner
carriage
entrance
where
several
labourers
in
white
overalls
were
busily
engaged
covering
the
bare
brick
walls
with
highly
veined
marble
stucco
men
were
at
work
in
the
yard
as
well
the
round
cobble
stones
with
which
it
had
once
been
paved
were
lying
in
heaps
and
the
ground
was
being
covered
with
an
ornate
mosaic
of
a
light
grey
broken
by
white
swirls
and
circles
like
the
flooring
in
ancient
churches
at
the
back
of
the
yard
rose
the
bald
brick
side
of
the
factory
which
also
was
undergoing
changes
in
accordance
with
the
general
beautifying
scheme
up
to
about
the
second
story
the
wall
was
being
set
with
yellow
and
blue
tiles
they
looked
gay
and
festive
and
upon
the
completion
of
the
repairs
the
old
smoky
court
would
have
the
appearance
of
a
decorated
salon
they
doing
things
here
in
great
style
thought
lilly
growing
even
more
timid
to
her
left
in
a
corner
of
the
court
she
saw
a
building
to
which
not
a
drop
of
the
varnish
being
used
on
the
other
parts
of
the
establishment
had
been
applied
it
stood
there
with
bare
plastered
walls
next
to
an
extremely
plain
flight
of
iron
steps
was
a
metal
plate
inscribed
office
lilly
went
up
the
iron
steps
and
entered
a
badly
lighted
dusty
room
divided
in
two
by
a
wooden
rail
on
the
farther
side
of
which
a
half
dozen
young
people
were
sitting
at
desks
covered
with
spotted
threadbare
felt
they
all
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
it
did
not
occur
to
one
of
them
to
ask
her
what
she
wanted
evidently
a
person
like
herself
had
never
before
been
seen
in
the
place
the
group
was
turned
to
stone
and
did
not
regain
animation
until
she
drew
her
card
from
her
gold
brocade
purse
and
silently
laid
it
on
the
table
then
the
six
of
them
jumped
up
and
tried
to
get
possession
of
it
there
came
near
being
a
row
but
one
of
them
a
tall
fellow
who
seemed
to
have
some
authority
chased
the
others
back
to
their
seats
with
a
few
furtive
nudges
and
bowing
and
scraping
said
to
lilly
he
would
immediately
go
see
whether
dehnicke
and
with
the
card
in
his
hand
disappeared
into
a
back
room
a
few
moments
passed
lilly
could
hear
subdued
voices
through
the
door
czepanek
do
know
her
ask
her
what
she
wants
what
does
she
look
like
the
answer
which
lasted
several
seconds
seemed
to
have
been
satisfactory
for
the
clerk
came
out
and
without
further
ado
opened
the
gate
in
the
wooden
railing
and
ushered
lilly
into
the
back
room
at
last
stood
before
her
stocky
shorter
than
herself
with
a
tendency
toward
stoutness
a
round
face
good
greyish
blue
eyes
which
said
little
an
arched
brow
light
brown
hair
brushed
back
smooth
from
his
temples
a
short
moustache
turned
up
abruptly
at
each
end
probably
to
proclaim
the
lieutenant
remarkably
small
hands
and
ears
everything
about
him
breathed
tidiness
and
scrupulousness
though
it
would
not
have
mattered
if
he
had
been
less
well
groomed
he
was
taken
aback
at
lilly
entrance
his
eyes
grew
round
with
polite
astonishment
the
consciousness
that
she
had
not
failed
to
make
an
impression
emboldened
her
and
gave
her
a
sense
of
security
it
was
not
in
vain
that
she
had
gone
through
miss
von
schwertfeger
schooling
i
have
come
to
you
at
the
recommendation
of
a
friend
of
both
of
us
who
prepared
you
for
this
visit
she
began
inwardly
rejoiced
to
be
able
once
again
to
play
the
a
mirror
hung
opposite
and
lilly
regarded
with
satisfaction
the
discreet
wreath
of
violets
about
her
lilac
turban
and
the
suit
her
image
looking
affably
from
the
frame
reminded
her
of
a
picture
by
some
portrait
painter
of
high
life
dehnicke
silently
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
an
expectant
distrust
was
to
be
detected
in
his
eyes
in
place
of
the
consternation
of
the
first
seconds
evidently
he
did
not
dare
to
place
her
in
the
class
in
which
to
judge
from
her
appearance
she
belonged
his
head
was
set
a
bit
obliquely
on
his
neck
inclining
to
the
left
as
if
he
had
recently
had
an
attack
of
lumbago
this
posture
increased
lilly
impression
that
he
suspected
her
she
looked
down
at
her
brocade
purse
and
acted
as
if
she
could
scarcely
suppress
a
smile
he
became
still
more
confused
may
i
ask
he
stammered
who
that
friend
i
do
recall
in
perplexity
he
turned
over
the
visiting
card
his
clerk
had
brought
him
lilly
rebelled
at
having
to
utter
her
former
lover
name
and
so
expose
her
shame
to
the
man
who
lived
behind
those
respectable
porcelain
flower
pots
is
it
possible
she
asked
hesitatingly
that
you
do
not
recall
having
received
a
letter
from
a
comrade
in
your
regiment
in
which
he
asks
you
to
interest
yourself
in
a
lady
who
dehnicke
jumped
to
his
feet
and
reddened
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
his
eyes
grew
bright
and
round
between
his
stretched
lids
and
threatened
to
pop
from
their
sockets
i
beg
pardon
he
faltered
you
probably
refer
to
a
letter
which
i
received
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
ago
from
lieutenant
von
prell
i
do
my
lady
he
cried
completely
upset
if
i
had
suspected
that
my
lady
so
much
simple
respect
was
depicted
on
his
face
that
consciousness
of
aristocracy
was
heightened
quite
a
bit
but
so
it
could
not
remain
i
call
myself
lilly
czepanek
she
whispered
blushing
in
her
turn
though
delighting
in
the
expression
call
myself
which
permitted
the
assumption
that
she
had
voluntarily
chosen
to
use
her
maiden
name
fright
at
the
indelicacy
of
which
he
thought
himself
guilty
was
plainly
to
be
read
in
his
features
i
beg
pardon
he
said
i
should
have
remembered
that
you
must
have
gone
through
many
difficulties
then
as
if
shot
from
a
pistol
why
did
you
come
sooner
i
waited
and
waited
a
month
several
months
then
i
took
to
looking
for
you
in
vain
i
even
thought
of
going
to
a
detective
bureau
but
i
feared
overstepping
the
bounds
of
reserve
lilly
nodded
with
a
smile
of
appreciation
unfortunately
i
did
not
dream
of
another
name
so
i
gave
up
the
hope
of
ever
having
the
great
pleasure
in
the
exuberance
of
his
delight
he
seemed
prepared
to
clasp
her
hand
however
he
proved
himself
sufficiently
well
bred
to
desist
when
he
saw
she
did
not
respond
lilly
now
had
the
reins
of
the
situation
in
her
hands
she
felt
she
was
so
saturated
with
the
romance
of
suffering
so
enveloped
by
the
delicate
aroma
of
aristocratic
aloofness
that
she
might
just
have
stepped
out
of
one
of
asmussen
novels
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
your
reproaches
i
see
i
did
not
knock
at
your
door
in
vain
i
assure
you
he
replied
inclining
his
head
still
more
to
the
left
by
way
of
emphasis
i
place
myself
at
your
service
with
all
my
powers
with
everything
i
am
and
he
paused
the
word
have
which
should
naturally
have
followed
was
more
than
he
the
scrupulous
business
man
would
allow
to
pass
his
lips
so
lightly
i
will
not
make
great
demands
on
you
of
course
lilly
replied
airily
to
put
a
little
damper
on
his
ardour
i
simply
do
not
want
to
be
without
someone
to
advise
me
as
to
a
way
of
earning
my
livelihood
and
since
von
prell
at
last
the
name
came
out
said
i
might
place
perfect
confidence
in
you
you
may
rely
upon
me
as
upon
von
prell
himself
that
not
saying
a
great
deal
flashed
through
her
head
but
she
kept
from
revealing
her
thought
by
so
much
as
a
smile
by
the
way
what
do
you
hear
from
him
he
asked
lilly
blushed
if
she
admitted
his
silence
she
laid
herself
bare
irremediably
so
not
to
appear
forsaken
and
cast
aside
she
said
on
parting
we
agreed
not
to
write
to
each
other
for
the
time
being
we
thought
in
the
struggle
ahead
of
us
that
eternal
waiting
for
news
and
that
eternal
fear
for
each
other
would
not
leave
us
with
the
strength
necessary
for
meeting
the
demands
of
life
but
you
probably
have
gotten
a
letter
from
him
lately
he
started
and
reflected
an
instant
yes
that
is
no
not
lately
sometime
ago
he
wrote
he
was
getting
along
he
said
he
was
about
to
make
a
career
for
himself
and
he
asked
most
urgently
as
to
your
whereabouts
in
regard
to
which
of
course
to
my
great
distress
i
could
not
enlighten
him
this
did
not
sound
very
likely
a
moment
before
he
himself
had
been
asking
for
news
of
walter
and
now
when
she
inquired
for
address
he
had
to
acknowledge
stammering
that
the
letter
had
not
contained
an
address
and
for
that
reason
it
was
quite
clear
he
had
fabricated
probably
he
hoped
to
acquire
greater
importance
in
her
eyes
by
representing
his
relations
with
her
lover
as
still
continuing
but
since
similar
motives
had
led
her
to
trifle
with
the
truth
she
had
no
cause
for
feeling
angry
with
him
she
now
told
him
the
purpose
of
her
visit
described
the
delicate
craft
she
had
learned
a
few
months
before
the
desire
she
had
to
perfect
herself
in
it
and
her
helplessness
when
it
came
to
practical
matters
might
she
ask
dehnicke
to
recommend
some
artist
who
could
instruct
her
that
was
all
she
had
come
to
him
for
he
listened
to
her
with
professional
interest
and
acted
as
if
he
took
her
plans
ever
so
seriously
but
behind
the
mute
thoughtfulness
of
his
features
lay
something
that
did
not
please
her
it
was
not
pity
most
certainly
not
it
was
rather
a
holding
back
and
seeking
then
an
increasing
satisfaction
as
if
he
felt
he
was
gaining
ground
in
the
measure
in
which
the
helplessness
of
her
situation
became
apparent
a
very
easy
matter
he
replied
his
manner
less
constrained
than
before
there
are
several
real
painters
among
the
artists
who
furnish
the
models
for
my
business
one
of
them
he
turned
the
pages
of
a
book
kellermann
the
very
man
and
then
however
we
drop
that
for
the
present
there
are
other
things
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
your
practising
your
profession
which
it
strikes
me
are
more
important
so
please
do
consider
me
impolite
if
i
put
some
questions
to
you
lilly
nodded
assent
what
artistic
training
have
you
had
well
you
see
that
just
it
lilly
replied
getting
the
better
of
her
embarrassment
just
because
i
never
had
any
i
should
like
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
what
are
your
means
of
support
she
was
silent
she
felt
as
if
her
clothes
were
being
drawn
from
her
body
piece
by
piece
i
need
not
tell
you
he
added
it
not
my
intention
to
pry
into
matters
that
do
not
concern
me
but
since
you
honoured
me
by
asking
my
advice
i
still
have
some
jewels
she
said
looking
at
him
severely
and
haughtily
when
they
go
i
have
nothing
he
nodded
slightly
as
if
to
say
i
thought
so
one
more
question
in
what
sort
of
a
place
are
you
living
now
in
the
sort
of
place
befitting
my
condition
four
flights
up
with
a
poor
woman
the
one
from
whom
i
learned
pasting
pressed
flowers
as
she
said
this
her
glance
fell
upon
the
mirror
and
showed
her
the
image
of
the
beautiful
aristocratic
society
dame
who
had
condescended
to
bestow
a
visit
upon
dehnicke
comrade
of
the
reserves
in
his
dark
hole
of
an
office
he
rose
and
for
a
few
moments
paced
up
and
down
between
the
desk
and
the
door
he
was
so
spruce
and
his
clothes
fitted
him
so
snugly
that
everything
about
him
cracked
and
creaked
in
his
polished
rotundity
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
bandbox
he
had
a
little
bald
spot
too
but
the
expression
of
his
face
remained
serious
almost
uneasy
as
if
he
were
weighed
down
by
heavy
thoughts
he
came
to
a
halt
before
her
and
his
voice
quivered
a
little
as
he
spoke
what
i
am
going
to
say
has
its
roots
in
the
many
years
of
genuine
friendship
that
unite
me
to
von
prell
the
mocking
condescending
words
with
which
walter
had
recommended
him
to
her
occurred
to
lilly
i
passed
so
many
delightful
hours
in
his
company
i
owe
him
so
much
inspiration
and
he
stopped
he
owed
him
so
much
he
could
not
remember
it
all
on
the
instant
i
will
remain
in
debt
to
him
the
rest
of
my
life
who
feels
he
is
indebted
to
me
because
i
pumped
him
for
coin
was
what
walter
had
written
then
there
really
did
exist
such
touching
creatures
in
the
world
but
i
am
most
grateful
to
him
for
the
confidence
he
showed
in
me
by
bequeathing
his
betrothed
to
me
so
to
speak
betrothed
the
word
had
been
uttered
she
had
not
deceived
herself
it
frightened
her
but
she
did
not
repudiate
it
until
that
day
she
had
not
even
dreamed
of
considering
walter
and
herself
bound
to
each
other
neither
herself
nor
the
poor
little
fellow
who
did
not
know
how
to
care
for
himself
much
less
for
a
wife
and
child
but
then
in
the
eyes
of
this
man
with
his
morals
that
was
the
only
justification
for
her
bungled
existence
and
not
only
in
his
eyes
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
and
if
she
cared
in
her
own
eyes
too
if
she
clung
to
the
man
who
was
practically
dead
to
her
fastening
upon
him
all
her
wishes
and
feelings
she
would
have
a
support
for
her
entire
being
she
could
ask
for
absolution
and
justification
even
before
god
all
this
flashed
through
her
mind
with
lightning
rapidity
while
dehnicke
continued
to
asseverate
his
friendship
for
walter
and
look
at
her
with
his
round
eyes
in
undesirous
adoration
finally
he
came
to
the
point
in
his
place
and
for
his
sake
i
advise
you
most
urgently
to
quit
surroundings
that
do
not
suit
you
and
create
an
environment
in
keeping
with
your
past
if
you
ever
wish
to
realise
your
plans
you
will
have
to
what
has
my
environment
to
do
with
my
art
queried
lilly
shrugging
her
shoulders
well
in
the
first
place
you
must
have
a
studio
where
you
can
receive
your
customers
where
you
can
show
them
who
you
are
and
the
extent
of
your
artistic
demands
and
what
the
real
nature
of
your
artistic
intentions
are
that
is
the
only
way
of
preventing
your
customers
from
treating
and
paying
you
like
an
ordinary
worker
but
the
customers
do
come
to
me
she
interjected
they
should
come
to
you
he
exclaimed
talking
himself
into
a
degree
of
eagerness
an
artist
with
does
take
one
step
outside
his
studio
to
offer
his
wares
for
sale
you
must
treat
yourself
the
same
way
she
mentally
calculated
the
value
of
the
rest
of
her
brooches
rings
and
bracelets
and
rejoined
with
a
smile
easily
said
dehnicke
made
a
bold
sally
my
sincere
friendship
for
walter
now
he
called
him
by
his
first
name
gives
me
the
right
how
shall
i
say
to
make
provision
to
lilly
saw
what
was
coming
and
shut
off
further
discussion
i
feel
content
where
i
am
she
declared
and
until
i
have
created
with
my
own
efforts
the
suitable
environment
that
you
so
kindly
wish
for
me
i
do
not
feel
i
am
entitled
to
make
a
change
he
bowed
his
friendly
zeal
cooled
off
markedly
but
he
asked
for
her
address
so
that
he
might
know
where
he
should
send
her
the
desired
information
lilly
hesitatingly
gave
it
to
him
and
added
the
request
that
in
no
circumstances
should
he
come
to
see
her
he
bowed
again
and
his
coolness
became
rigidity
but
lilly
rejoiced
that
she
had
known
so
well
how
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
nobody
in
the
wide
world
should
call
her
a
beggar
she
therefore
took
leave
all
the
more
graciously
for
she
had
not
come
to
him
in
order
to
frighten
him
away
forever
he
was
quick
to
profit
by
her
warmer
tone
and
became
ardent
again
if
there
was
anything
else
he
could
do
for
her
if
she
felt
lonely
and
required
company
lilly
looked
at
his
right
hand
saw
no
wedding
ring
there
and
smiled
no
he
understood
look
and
smile
for
he
said
hemming
and
hawing
in
an
endeavour
to
conquer
fresh
confusion
i
live
alone
with
my
mother
but
unfortunately
i
can
not
take
you
to
see
her
because
she
is
sickly
and
since
my
father
death
has
withdrawn
entirely
from
society
but
i
would
be
most
careful
as
to
the
company
to
which
i
should
introduce
you
i
took
that
for
granted
lilly
replied
with
amiable
condescension
in
spite
of
that
thank
you
really
in
the
peculiar
position
i
am
in
it
is
better
for
me
not
to
mingle
with
people
she
gave
him
a
regal
bow
held
out
her
hand
and
left
he
followed
her
respectfully
and
the
six
young
gentlemen
stood
up
in
a
row
and
curved
their
backs
like
their
employer
with
flushed
face
lilly
passed
the
partially
completed
decorations
in
the
yard
and
walked
along
the
imitation
marble
entrance
to
the
street
thinking
in
mingled
triumph
and
disenchantment
no
that
was
a
path
of
destiny
but
she
had
suddenly
acquired
a
betrothed
that
was
something
at
any
rate
chapter
iv
august
kellermann
though
unsuccessful
in
selling
his
pictures
enjoyed
a
fair
reputation
as
a
painter
he
was
a
knowing
fellow
of
about
seven
times
washed
in
the
life
of
the
metropolis
who
got
great
amusement
from
his
own
astuteness
he
had
a
sandy
rubens
beard
and
small
bleared
eyes
with
an
eternal
yawn
in
them
from
the
night
before
he
lived
in
an
abandoned
photographer
studio
of
enormous
dimensions
like
a
huge
glass
case
to
keep
out
the
glare
and
the
heat
he
had
hung
oriental
rugs
under
the
skylight
propping
them
up
on
long
poles
and
their
fringed
ends
hung
down
as
in
a
beduin
tent
when
lilly
stepped
from
the
dim
anteroom
into
the
glare
of
the
diffused
light
from
above
it
was
so
high
it
seemed
a
very
part
of
the
heaven
she
found
him
in
a
sack
coat
and
worn
green
unheeled
slippers
over
which
hung
his
stockings
he
was
squatting
on
the
floor
next
to
an
oriental
coffee
tray
poking
at
a
narghile
that
had
gone
out
lordy
he
exclaimed
without
responding
to
her
greeting
and
without
rising
it
worth
receiving
such
a
visit
lilly
prepared
to
withdraw
then
he
shot
to
his
feet
like
an
arrow
hoisted
his
trousers
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
wiped
the
dust
from
a
bamboo
chair
with
his
sleeves
sit
down
child
i
have
given
up
painting
for
the
present
and
have
gone
in
for

and
i
should
not
be
able
to
make
use
of
fair
helen
herself
but
i
wo
let
anything
like
you
escape
me
not
i
lilly
handed
him
her
benefactor
letter
which
she
had
received
the
day
before
and
enlightened
him
as
to
the
mistake
he
had
made
now
his
manner
will
change
she
thought
nothing
of
the
sort
took
place
botheration
he
said
scratching
his
head
noblest
of
women
why
are
you
so
beautiful
quondam
general
wife
here
she
was
general
wife
again
i
had
imagined
spectacles
and
pimples
and
now
something
like
this
comes
along
then
you
probably
know
what
my
motive
is
in
visiting
you
asked
lilly
who
was
too
to
express
resentment
at
his
tone
he
clapped
his
fleshy
hand
to
his
forehead

but
i
suffer
from
congenital
defect
of
my
faculties
of
apprehension
and
i
hope
you
will
be
good
enough
to
when
lilly
explained
the
nature
of
her
desires
he
broke
out
into
unrestrained
laughter
that
you
shall
have
my
aristocratic
friend
you
shall
certainly
enjoy
the
benefit
of
my
instruction
even
if
you
had
been
such
a
treat
does
happen
every
day
i
will
charm
so
many
sunsets
out
of
the
heavens
and
set
them
on
glass
in
hues
so
roseate
you
will
never
be
able
to
look
a
rose
in
the
face
again
lilly
was
by
no
means
ignorant
that
in
her
capacity
of
aristocratic
lady
the
part
she
wished
to
play
she
should
have
left
the
studio
long
before
but
she
was
too
eager
to
avail
herself
of
his
readiness
to
instruct
she
could
not
throw
away
the
opportunity
so
painfully
won
what
would
anna
von
schwertfeger
do
in
such
a
situation
she
asked
herself
then
tossing
her
head
she
said
but
there
are
certain
matters
to
be
settled
before
we
proceed
further
in
the
first
place
i
should
like
to
know
what
your
charges
are
so
that
i
may
decide
if
i
can
afford
to
pay
for
such
valuable
services
he
looked
somewhat
disconcerted
and
remarked
that
dehnicke
would
probably
look
out
for
that
dehnicke
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
my
money
matters
she
replied
if
there
should
be
any
misunderstanding
as
to
that
she
grasped
her
parasol
she
had
kept
her
gloves
on
tut
tut
do
be
so
hasty
said
kellermann
he
reflected
a
few
moments
and
then
mentioned
a
reasonable
charge
five
marks
a
morning
the
ruby
ring
thought
lilly
and
nodded
i
curious
as
to
the
second
condition
he
said
it
is
more
important
to
me
than
the
first
it
is
i
should
like
to
be
treated
like
a
lady
oh
he
said
i
not
fine
enough
for
you
we
fix
that
i
can
be
fine
as
silk
i
tell
i
can
in
fact
i
possess
six
degrees
of
fineness
and
all
you
need
do
is
choose
the
one
you
like
best
superfine
extrafine
fine
semifine
impolite
and
downright
vulgar
now
select
this
joke
and
a
few
more
similar
in
quality
pleased
lilly
so
well
that
for
the
present
she
gave
up
her
demand
to
be
respected
as
a
and
was
content
if
in
associating
with
her
he
did
not
pay
her
court
and
took
her
as
a
good
fellow
however
her
admonition
had
not
failed
of
effect
the
next
day
when
she
came
he
was
wearing
boots
he
proved
to
be
an
intelligent
discreet
teacher
who
did
not
essay
wild
flights
with
his
pupil
and
manifested
kindly
considerate
interest
in
her
childish
plan
he
devised
something
of
gelatine
especially
for
her
purpose
by
which
colours
on
a
transparency
gained
in
brilliancy
he
was
untiring
in
planning
new
effects
i
will
make
six
bloody
sunsets
for
you
he
said
with
which
you
will
deal
a
blow
to
all
your
competitors
in
a
body
especially
that
extremely
conscienceless
lady
who
perpetrates
the
most
impertinent
pranks
i
mean
of
course
dame
nature
while
lilly
daubed
on
a
window
pane
he
stood
smoking
turkish
tobacco
or
chewing
ginger
before
one
of
the
modelling
stands
that
took
up
the
centre
of
the
room
and
pottered
at
his
work
the
artistic
creations
that
he
fetched
out
of
the
depths
of
his
soul
were
usually
human
figures
half
or
third
life
size
knights
in
armour
bearing
banners
maidens
in
old
german
costumes
aimlessly
stretching
out
their
hands
allegoric
women
figures
doing
the
same
heralds
blowing
trumpets
and
now
and
then
secession
shapes
long
slim
swirly
limbs
which
trailed
off
like
a
nixy
body
into
a
fish
tail
into
ash
trays
finger
bowls
or
other
such
pleasing
and
useful
objects
and
all
the
while
that
he
was
turning
out
factory
models
dusty
paintings
and
sketches
hung
on
the
walls
or
stood
on
the
floor
leaning
against
the
walls
they
showed
a
bold
inventiveness
a
riotous
joy
in
colour
each
seemed
to
bear
the
mark
of
a
reckless
conception
and
a
laughing
ability
to
execute
one
was
a
picture
of
a
church
in
a
tropical
forest
with
a
pack
of
monkeys
chasing
over
the
altar
another
a
group
of
stupid
camels
in
a
depressing
desert
scene
snuffling
at
the
corpse
of
a
dead
lion
the
best
was
a
painting
of
a
naked
woman
weighed
down
by
heavy
chains
which
bound
her
blooming
lustrous
body
to
a
parched
rock
while
a
flock
of
black
vultures
hovered
about
her
head
there
was
much
else
which
testified
to
force
and
originality
but
the
woman
in
chains
remained
lilly
favourite
one
day
she
ventured
to
ask
her
teacher
why
he
permitted
all
these
paintings
to
go
to
ruin
instead
of
finishing
them
and
placing
them
on
exhibit
because
i
have
to
produce
you
innocent
angel
you
he
replied
and
splashed
a
clod
of
clay
against
the
leg
of
the
allegoric
lady
he
was
working
on
because
the
world
requires
lamps
and
vases
but
not
an
eternal
beauty
with
inside
her
lovely
body
because
there
are
of
imitation
bronze
ware
who
keep
you
from
dropping
by
the
roadside
and
because
i
a
fellow
with
sound
teeth
who
must
have
a
few
morsels
of
life
to
crunch
and
after
starving
for
twenty
years
would
like
to
join
the
great
band
of
dionysus
worshippers
do
you
understand
you
you
but
the
woman
with
the
chains
why
do
you
finish
her
at
least
he
burst
into
mocking
laughter
at
himself
and
threw
himself
full
length
on
the
couch
which
stood
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
large
room
then
he
jumped
up
and
offered
lilly
some
of
the
ginger
from
the
pot
he
always
kept
on
hand
she
declined
and
pressed
him
for
an
answer
good
lord
he
said
do
you
realise
how
heavily
one
own
chains
weigh
one
down
fire
would
have
to
descend
from
heaven
and
melt
my
manacles
or
else
the
goddess
herself
would
have
to
come
down
lay
her
corset
and
stockings
on
that
chair
there
and
say
i
am
sir
here
is
the
body
begin
look
and
paint
to
your
heart
content
still
chewing
ginger
he
took
his
stand
in
front
of
lilly
and
raised
his
clasped
hands
up
to
her
you
look
at
me
so
oddly
she
said
what
have
to
do
with
all
that
i
not
saying
anything
he
exclaimed
i
have
too
much
contemptible
respect
to
but
when
my
beauty
shall
have
cried
for
freedom
long
enough
she
cries
day
and
night
sometimes
she
cries
so
i
ca
sleep
then
perhaps
the
miracle
will
happen
and
a
certain
lady
who
is
now
blushing
even
unto
her
eyeballs
will
come
and
i
think
we
better
get
to
work
said
lilly
after
that
day
lilly
took
good
care
not
to
speak
of
the
picture
nor
even
give
it
a
sidelong
glance
if
she
thought
kellermann
might
see
her
nevertheless
he
made
many
beseeching
allusions
to
his
presumptuous
desire
which
he
seemed
unable
to
dismiss
from
his
mind
finally
lilly
had
to
forbid
his
ever
referring
to
it
her
zeal
for
learning
increased
daily
the
hours
in
the
studio
did
not
suffice
she
practiced
at
home
as
well
and
when
she
tried
her
skill
on
the
glass
plates
she
had
bought
the
result
in
her
and
opinion
was
highly
commendable
in
the
background
the
sun
set
in
the
prescribed
manner
in
a
sea
of
blood
over
hilltops
of
a
robin
egg
blue
in
the
foreground
stood
woods
dark
and
silent
of
grass
and
ferns
belonging
anywhere
between
the
jurassic
and
carboniferous
ages
shading
huts
festively
lighted
from
within
constructed
by
a
race
of
men
who
must
have
acquired
culture
at
an
extremely
early
period
in
the
world
history
lilly
lacked
the
courage
to
show
her
creations
to
her
master
he
had
declared
as
a
matter
of
principle
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
those
pasted
abominations
but
it
would
have
been
a
great
pleasure
to
let
dehnicke
see
what
she
had
learned
and
achieved
since
she
had
visited
him
unfortunately
after
receiving
that
one
letter
she
did
not
hear
from
him
again
and
she
was
abashed
at
having
been
set
aside
so
lightly
but
one
day
kellermann
said
what
the
devil
the
bronze
manufacturing
business
seems
to
be
booming
all
of
a
sudden
our
dehnicke
ca
give
me
enough
orders
he
up
here
every
day
to
see
how
things
are
progressing
something
in
kellermann
manner
of
blinking
at
her
made
lilly
blush
and
disquieted
her
though
at
the
same
time
it
filled
her
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
at
length
when
the
seven
pairs
of
plates
had
been
painted
and
she
could
no
longer
endure
her
excess
of
eager
pride
she
took
heart
and
wrote
him
a
letter
on
her
beautiful
ivory
paper
with
the
golden
coronet
she
had
about
twenty
sheets
of
it
left
since
he
had
taken
such
kindly
interest
in
her
she
wrote
she
would
ask
him
to
come
next
sunday
afternoon
and
so
on
his
reply
arrived
without
delay
her
kind
letter
gratified
his
dearest
wish
he
had
greatly
desired
to
visit
her
but
had
remained
away
so
long
merely
out
of
respect
for
her
wishes
and
then
on
the
appointed
sunday
afternoon
he
came
lilly
had
placed
a
gladiolus
plant
in
the
punch
bowl
and
stuck
pink
carnations
back
of
the
box
containing
the
lamp
shade
suspended
at
the
windows
by
silk
ribbons
hung
the
sunsets
glowing
like
a
conflagration
and
throwing
a
magic
light
on
the
motley
frippery
that
laue
had
saved
along
with
her
own
self
from
better
times
in
her
white
lace
blouse
which
she
herself
had
washed
and
ironed
lilly
looked
gay
and
festive
and
when
she
held
out
her
hand
to
dehnicke
who
appeared
in
the
doorway
clad
in
patent
leather
shoes
and
a
bowing
and
scraping
she
was
once
again
the
affable
unapproachable
society
lady
who
three
weeks
before
had
entered
his
office
and
given
rather
than
gotten
her
benefactor
seemed
all
the
more
embarrassed
he
sniffed
the
smell
that
penetrated
laue
best
room
from
the
rest
of
the
house
looked
up
and
down
the
walls
uneasily
and
in
general
acted
as
if
he
were
trespassing
on
forbidden
territory
how
happy
he
was
he
said
that
she
had
at
last
granted
him
permission
he
had
wished
to
appear
intrusive
he
would
have
waited
even
longer
had
not
her
note
removed
all
his
doubts
he
repeated
everything
he
had
said
in
his
letter
with
nervous
precipitation
which
did
not
harmonise
with
his
elegant
appearance
or
his
usual
frosty
manner
lilly
thanked
him
amiably
for
all
he
had
done
for
her
regretted
having
caused
him
the
inconvenience
of
coming
to
see
her
and
all
the
while
felt
that
with
each
word
she
was
falling
back
more
and
more
into
the
rôle
of
the
general
wife
partly
against
her
will
who
does
the
honours
in
her
with
courteous
condescension
gradually
she
turned
the
conversation
in
to
her
art
she
said
she
was
sorry
she
was
so
incompetent
and
pointed
to
the
transparencies
at
the
windows
dehnicke
jumped
up
he
was
silent
for
a
while
then
burst
into
exclamations
of
enthusiasm
for
each
of
which
he
had
to
take
a
fresh
start
as
it
were
reiterating
his
praises
with
a
certain
monotony
of
tone
and
smiling
in
an
embarrassed
way
lilly
was
far
too
delighted
to
suspect
the
tone
of
his
criticism
have
you
shown
them
to
mr
kellermann
asked
dehnicke
lilly
confessed
to
her
lack
of
courage
besides
she
added
i
felt
i
ought
to
show
them
to
you
first
he
looked
at
her
gratefully
and
worshipfully
and
said
if
you
have
done
so
yet
i
advise
you
to
refrain
from
ever
showing
them
to
him
despite
his
apparent
willingness
the
man
is
obsessed
by
inordinate
professional
conceit
and
it
might
be
dehnicke
seemed
to
fear
to
say
more
lilly
plucked
up
her
courage
and
asked
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
only
slight
importance
whether
he
thought
anyone
would
buy
her
work
dehnicke
became
silent
again
and
with
his
index
finger
scratched
at
the
left
side
of
his
upper
lip
under
his
moustache
then
he
inclined
his
smooth
round
head
still
more
to
the
left
and
said
weighing
each
word
it
would
be
best
if
you
were
to
entrust
the
sale
of
your
transparencies
to
me
i
have
certain
connections
and
i
know
the
character
of
the
buyers
if
i
set
the
glass
in
bronze
frames
or
something
of
the
sort
i
might
even
dispose
of
them
as
goods
of
my
own
lilly
flushed
with
gratitude
oh
will
you
she
cried
grasping
his
hand
at
least
until
i
have
found
customers
for
myself
the
pressure
of
her
hand
caused
him
to
redden
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
in
order
to
do
that
he
said
looking
away
from
her
with
an
abashed
expression
you
must
move
away
from
here
at
once
and
establish
a
home
worthy
of
yourself
i
will
gladly
she
answered
gaily
as
soon
as
i
have
earned
the
wherewithal
that
may
mean
years
i
will
wait
years
may
i
be
permitted
he
stammered
to
remind
you
once
more
that
being
an
old
and
intimate
friend
of
your
betrothed
i
am
justified
lilly
drew
herself
up
if
my
betrothed
she
said
ever
should
or
could
take
care
of
me
i
might
not
have
to
refuse
but
as
it
is
i
may
not
allow
anybody
in
the
world
not
even
his
dearest
friend
to
make
offers
which
at
best
would
merely
humiliate
me
she
turned
her
face
aside
to
hide
her
tears
which
arose
from
a
sense
of
insult
dehnicke
contritely
begged
her
pardon
but
something
like
a
bit
of
fluttered
triumph
sat
in
his
eyes
when
it
had
been
agreed
that
one
of
his
waggons
was
to
come
the
following
day
to
fetch
the
transparencies
and
all
business
had
been
settled
dehnicke
modestly
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
a
few
moments
longer
he
would
like
to
speak
a
little
more
about
the
absent
friend
it
was
his
only
opportunity
a
great
pleasure
for
me
too
i
am
sure
replied
lilly
and
invited
him
to
be
seated
i
am
happy
to
have
found
somebody
with
whom
i
can
speak
about
my
betrothed
betrothed
now
fell
quite
naturally
from
her
lips
she
felt
somewhat
stirred
when
she
uttered
it
the
chance
that
dehnicke
might
prolong
his
visit
had
been
foreseen
and
provided
for
lilly
needed
only
to
ring
and
laue
appeared
in
the
famous
brown
velvet
dress
with
one
of
lilly
white
fichus
modestly
tucked
in
the
neck
and
carrying
a
tea
tray
with
two
very
dainty
coffee
cups
on
being
presented
to
dehnicke
she
made
a
courtesy
than
which
none
more
aristocratic
was
to
be
seen
at
the
balls
of
prince
orloffski
after
saying
a
few
suitable
words
about
the
great
actors
of
the
past
and
the
photographs
to
which
they
had
affixed
their
signatures
especially
for
her
she
took
leave
as
was
proper
lilly
displayed
style
as
a
hostess
and
like
the
aroma
of
the
coffee
the
spirit
of
better
days
hovered
over
all
about
four
days
later
the
mail
brought
lilly
czepanek
a
for
marks
sender
richard
dehnicke
of
liebert
dehnicke
mfrs
of
metal
wares
and
on
the
left
side
was
the
remark
seven
with
pressed
flowers
sold
at
mks
a
piece
the
foundations
of
a
livelihood
had
been
laid
chapter
v
now
followed
happy
times
with
part
of
the
sum
she
had
earned
lilly
bought
new
material
and
soon
more
sunsets
glowed
beyond
woods
of
dried
grass
when
she
lay
on
her
bed
during
the
hot
summer
nights
sleepless
from
overwork
she
would
give
herself
up
to
wild
dreams
of
what
she
would
do
when
her
art
had
conquered
the
world
she
would
start
a
workshop
like
dehnicke
employ
about
a
dozen
women
with
laue
of
course
as
forelady
then
hunt
up
her
father
and
transfer
her
poor
crazy
mother
to
a
fine
private
insane
asylum
what
else
oh
yes
provide
for
walter
certainly
now
that
she
felt
she
was
his
fiancée
and
her
future
was
his
this
was
her
bounden
duty
to
be
sure
he
must
first
let
himself
be
heard
from
but
some
day
lilly
knew
when
he
was
at
a
loss
where
to
turn
he
would
get
word
to
her
in
some
way
or
other
then
she
would
send
him
money
in
abundance
in
overflowing
measure
everything
her
craft
threw
into
her
lap
no
not
everything
one
task
the
greatest
the
holiest
merely
to
think
of
which
was
presumption
dominated
her
life
whether
or
not
her
father
returned
his
work
his
immortal
work
must
never
be
allowed
to
sink
into
oblivion
awaiting
its
summons
to
life
the
score
of
the
song
of
songs
still
lay
asleep
in
lilly
locked
trunk
but
its
sleep
was
no
longer
so
sound
so
dreamless
as
in
the
years
just
gone
by
it
began
to
stir
and
moan
it
gave
out
a
humming
and
ringing
which
echoed
through
the
day
work
and
crooned
in
lilly
sleep
causing
chords
and
melodies
to
sound
when
she
least
expected
them
from
the
blue
hills
beyond
which
the
sun
set
in
flames
came
a
soft
strain
as
if
blown
by
evening
winds
how
beautiful
are
thy
feet
in
sandals
o
prince
daughter
and
out
of
the
dark
depths
of
the
fabulous
woods
fluttered
fragments
of
songs
of
the
rose
of
sharon
and
the
lily
of
the
valley
it
was
almost
as
if
invisible
little
beings
were
singing
who
led
a
pleasant
existence
inside
those
pasteboard
huts
like
lilly
herself
the
whole
world
would
some
day
have
a
share
in
the
treasure
whose
guardian
fate
had
destined
her
to
be
wherever
she
went
or
stood
whatever
she
did
or
thought
from
all
corners
hopes
came
dancing
forth
beckoning
and
smiling
a
new
larger
purer
existence
was
now
to
begin
the
ends
of
that
golden
thread
which
her
insane
mother
had
cut
in
two
with
the
bread
knife
had
been
tied
together
again
and
drew
her
upward
upward
she
had
divinations
of
something
sacred
which
gave
forth
blessings
something
to
be
prayed
for
and
struggled
for
a
few
more
months
and
it
would
all
come
to
pass
a
piece
of
good
fortune
seldom
comes
unaccompanied
by
another
and
so
it
happened
that
miracle
of
miracles
her
betrothed
gave
a
sign
of
life
it
was
one
of
the
first
days
in
september
between
eleven
and
twelve
in
the
morning
when
dehnicke
appeared
at
her
door
without
having
announced
his
coming
lilly
was
not
completely
dressed
and
refused
at
first
to
see
him
in
however
he
was
so
insistent
that
the
business
on
which
he
had
come
was
extremely
important
that
she
did
not
venture
to
dismiss
him
and
offering
a
thousand
excuses
she
received
him
in
her
matinée
he
let
a
shy
glance
of
admiration
travel
over
her
and
then
drew
a
broad
piece
of
paper
from
his
pocket
which
proved
to
be
a
check
on
the
lincoln
and
ohio
bank
for
two
thousand
and
some
odd
marks
what
shall
i
do
with
it
asked
lilly
read
the
letter
it
came
enclosed
in
he
replied
unfolding
a
large
sheet
richard
dehnicke
dear
sir
was
informed
that
walter
von
prell
had
deposited
five
hundred
dollars
to
be
paid
over
to
baroness
lilly
von
mertzbach
lilly
was
shaken
by
a
storm
of
gratitude
she
ran
up
and
down
the
room
pressing
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
had
wanted
to
provide
for
him
and
now
was
providing
for
suddenly
she
was
fairly
overwhelmed
by
a
feeling
of
distrust
she
came
to
a
standstill
and
looked
from
the
check
to
dehnicke
and
back
at
the
check
again
both
were
wrapped
in
silence
do
explain
she
cried
utterly
perplexed
what
is
there
for
me
to
explain
he
rejoined
i
am
merely
the
middleman
or
if
you
will
the
agent
in
the
affair
which
really
concerns
no
one
but
you
and
your
affianced
if
at
least
he
had
given
his
address
cried
lilly
it
almost
looks
as
if
he
wanted
to
eradicate
all
trace
of
himself
dehnicke
observed
it
was
so
romantic
and
so
unlike
walter
how
could
she
help
being
at
a
loss
but
there
was
baroness
von
mertzbach
walter
was
the
only
person
not
likely
to
know
of
her
having
had
to
renounce
her
married
name
that
at
least
was
an
indication
of
the
genuineness
of
the
remittance
dehnicke
inclined
his
head
to
the
left
as
usual
and
regarded
her
with
calm
indifference
he
was
the
innocent
middleman
nothing
more
after
this
unexpected
turn
of
events
he
finally
said
you
will
of
course
no
longer
refuse
to
take
up
the
sort
of
life
that
accords
with
your
social
position
and
is
so
essential
for
the
sale
of
your
works
she
shook
her
head
biting
her
lips
hereupon
he
became
insistent
more
insistent
than
she
had
thought
his
modesty
would
permit
him
to
be
you
for
his
sake
you
must
i
am
responsible
to
him
for
that
if
he
should
return
and
want
to
marry
you
he
must
not
find
a
déclassée
i
am
responsible
to
him
for
that
lilly
asked
for
time
to
consider
from
now
on
her
distant
lover
held
sway
over
her
life
with
a
certain
emphasis
what
had
been
mere
fancy
became
reality
not
that
she
thought
of
him
unqualifiedly
as
the
real
sender
of
those
mysterious
five
hundred
dollars
on
the
contrary
the
voice
would
not
be
silenced
that
said
to
her
you
are
being
played
with
but
she
was
afraid
to
listen
to
it
or
even
draw
inferences
and
come
to
conclusions
for
if
she
were
to
lose
the
single
friend
she
had
then
what
in
order
to
down
all
her
doubts
and
scruples
she
worked
diligently
and
nearly
once
a
week
had
batches
of
sunsets
ready
to
be
taken
away
and
in
the
meantime
kellermann
had
brought
her
new
motifs
a
gothic
cathedral
perched
on
perpendicular
rocks
a
hunting
lodge
with
many
gleaming
windows
and
the
moon
rising
over
peaceful
waters
whose
silvery
sheen
was
broken
by
fern
fronds
october
came
the
first
sunday
of
the
month
dehnicke
called
to
take
lilly
out
walking
he
had
come
for
her
twice
before
and
lilly
had
accompanied
him
gladly
had
he
offered
to
take
her
to
the
country
her
happiness
would
have
been
complete
the
autumnal
sun
lay
peacefully
upon
the
tattered
leaves
of
the
bare
little
trees
that
edged
the
square
fountain
groups
of
people
sauntered
by
aimlessly
looking
bored
and
depressed
the
winter
was
already
laying
its
icy
touch
on
men
spirits
dehnicke
and
lilly
went
along
many
strange
streets
all
filled
with
human
beings
and
lilly
was
happily
conscious
of
having
a
leader
and
protector
at
her
side
in
all
that
bustle
dehnicke
who
had
been
brooding
over
something
a
long
time
finally
began
have
you
reached
a
decision
yet
as
to
your
way
of
living
in
the
future
lilly
did
not
reply
she
was
fully
determined
to
reject
every
offer
on
this
point
but
it
is
heavenly
to
have
someone
begging
of
you
you
feel
you
are
of
some
value
in
the
world
if
i
had
the
right
to
make
a
choice
for
you
he
continued
in
his
modest
prim
way
i
think
i
could
find
a
little
corner
that
you
would
delight
in
i
not
so
sure
of
that
she
rejoined
half
in
jest
you
seem
to
assume
that
our
tastes
are
absolutely
similar
oh
no
i
not
so
presumptuous
but
recently
i
saw
an
apartment
that
i
think
would
please
you
unless
i
very
much
mistaken
it
belongs
to
a
lady
customer
of
mine
who
left
town
what
a
pity
i
should
like
to
have
seen
it
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
find
out
whether
you
have
a
correct
estimate
of
me
he
reflected
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
i
think
i
can
take
you
to
see
it
the
maid
to
be
sure
wo
be
in
because
it
sunday
but
the
porter
wife
knows
me
and
will
give
me
the
key
so
if
you
want
to
lilly
hesitated
to
force
herself
into
the
home
of
an
absolute
stranger
but
dehnicke
overbore
her
objections
summoned
a
cab
and
ordered
that
they
be
driven
to
the
western
section
of
the
city
where
the
houses
are
statelier
and
the
people
look
more
aristocratic
and
a
row
of
glorious
chestnut
trees
planted
in
velvety
grass
hang
over
the
blue
waters
of
a
canal
oh
what
a
joy
it
must
be
to
live
here
she
cried
the
cab
drew
up
at
a
corner
house
on
the
dehnicke
went
to
the
porter
lodge
and
spoke
a
few
words
through
the
window
a
key
was
handed
to
him
and
he
led
lilly
up
the
carpeted
stairs
of
carved
oak
how
easy
to
ascend
them
and
how
different
from
the
bare
flagging
at
home
which
hurt
one
feet
he
stopped
at
a
door
on
the
second
floor
and
politely
rang
in
case
the
maid
should
be
in
after
all
but
no
one
answered
the
ring
so
he
unlocked
the
door
with
the
key
in
the
meanwhile
lilly
tried
to
read
the
name
posted
alongside
the
door
on
a
porcelain
plate
but
unsuccessfully
owing
to
the
dim
lighting
in
the
halls
they
entered
a
narrow
dark
anteroom
smelling
of
fresh
paint
and
passed
through
it
to
a
room
with
one
window
here
tall
closets
with
glass
doors
curtained
with
green
silk
were
ranged
against
the
walls
the
furniture
consisted
of
nothing
but
two
armchairs
a
few
small
gilt
chairs
and
a
large
dark
highly
polished
this
is
really
a
said
dehnicke
but
it
would
be
bad
for
a
sample
room
and
private
studio
for
you
lilly
who
would
have
enjoyed
contradicting
him
was
compelled
to
agree
adjoining
the
on
the
right
was
the
bedroom
with
cretonne
drapery
old
rose
enamelled
furniture
and
a
broad
canopied
bed
with
a
puffy
silk
counterpane
and
curtains
held
together
by
a
dull
gold
coronet
does
your
customer
belong
to
the
nobility
asked
lilly
seized
by
a
vague
feeling
of
envy
not
that
i
know
of
her
husband
is
a
nobleman
but
maybe
she
herself
is
of
noble
extraction
lilly
heaved
a
little
sigh
recalling
her
ivory
toilet
articles
and
her
underwear
embroidered
with
a
coronet
lying
in
laue
musty
drawers
how
well
they
would
suit
a
place
like
this
she
rapturously
breathed
in
the
delicate
lilac
perfume
which
penetrated
the
entire
room
like
the
aroma
of
an
aristocratic
spring
and
shuddered
as
she
compared
it
with
the
odour
that
was
invading
her
dresden
treasures
with
deadly
certainty
no
matter
how
persistently
she
aired
them
happy
creature
she
said
softly
it
struck
lilly
as
peculiar
that
no
traces
were
to
be
seen
of
the
life
and
activity
of
the
mistress
of
the
place
not
a
silk
ribbon
no
matinée
or
nightgown
not
a
bit
of
underwear
she
probably
locked
everything
away
or
took
everything
with
her
said
dehnicke
they
returned
to
the
and
through
the
other
door
on
the
left
entered
a
small
at
the
corner
of
the
house
it
was
flooded
with
sunlight
lilly
clasped
her
hands
rapturously
she
looked
at
the
delicate
old
rose
carpet
with
a
pattern
of
vaguely
outlined
vines
at
the
dear
little
crystal
chandelier
whose
prisms
radiated
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
at
the
dark
reddish
mahogany
furniture
with
bronze
statuettes
on
the
dainty
tables
a
woman
about
to
dive
into
water
with
outstretched
arms
a
reaper
folding
his
hands
in
prayer
at
the
sound
of
the
angelus
and
similar
subjects
there
was
a
little
bookcase
a
lady
secrétaire
paintings
on
the
walls
and
even
an
upright
piano
a
piano
sighed
lilly
closing
her
eyes
in
mournful
bliss
there
were
animate
objects
too
in
front
of
one
of
the
three
windows
stood
an
aquarium
with
a
palm
rising
over
it
and
the
sunlight
gleaming
on
the
water
and
the
gold
fish
a
canary
bird
chirped
at
them
from
another
window
lilly
recalled
her
light
blue
realm
in
comparison
how
plain
and
compact
all
this
was
like
a
bird
nest
yet
how
inconceivably
charming
when
contrasted
with
the
horror
she
now
dwelt
in
why
it
a
veritable
paradise
she
said
gaily
though
tears
were
rising
in
her
eyes
here
is
one
more
room
said
dehnicke
opening
a
door
which
lilly
had
failed
to
notice
it
has
a
separate
entrance
from
the
hall
of
the
house
the
lady
probably
uses
it
as
a
guest
room
or
something
like
that
if
you
were
living
here
it
would
do
admirably
for
a
place
for
your
assistants
to
work
in
lilly
looked
in
the
room
was
more
simply
furnished
than
the
others
though
not
without
care
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
stood
a
wide
table
with
greenish
grey
upholstered
chairs
standing
about
it
and
in
a
corner
was
a
comfortable
iron
bed
if
you
had
it
of
course
the
bed
would
have
to
be
removed
explained
dehnicke
it
was
really
remarkable
how
well
the
apartment
suited
her
purposes
they
returned
to
the
lilly
was
struck
by
something
she
had
not
observed
before
a
long
picture
in
an
ornate
carved
frame
hung
over
the
sofa
forming
as
it
were
the
centre
about
which
all
the
rest
of
the
furnishings
were
grouped
but
the
picture
itself
was
concealed
beneath
a
curtain
of
lavender
crape
what
that
lilly
asked
dehnicke
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
secrétaire
where
a
photograph
the
only
ornament
there
had
the
same
mysterious
veil
seized
with
curiosity
lilly
tried
slightly
to
raise
the
lower
end
of
the
covering
over
the
large
picture
i
wonder
whether
i
may
she
queried
timidly
as
if
about
to
commit
a
theft
if
you
have
the
courage
he
replied
apparently
breathing
a
little
more
heavily
than
usual
she
tugged
tugged
more
violently
the
crape
fell
off
and
before
her
hung
her
friend
and
betrothed
walter
von
prell
there
he
stood
in
the
uniform
of
his
former
regiment
boldly
and
carelessly
dashed
off
in
crayon
lilly
knees
trembled
cold
shivers
ran
through
her
body
she
refused
to
believe
to
understand
then
she
felt
dehnicke
take
her
hand
and
draw
her
to
the
outside
hall
he
lit
a
match
on
the
porcelain
plate
she
now
read
what
she
had
previously
been
unable
to
decipher
lilly
czepanek
pressed
flower
studio
she
uttered
a
cry
rushed
back
into
the
threw
herself
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
and
wept
the
hot
blissful
tears
of
desire
and
yearning
that
had
so
long
been
repressed
when
she
ventured
to
look
up
again
she
saw
dehnicke
waiting
before
her
modest
and
correct
with
his
sober
serious
face
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
being
so
happy
and
full
of
qualms
she
held
her
hand
out
to
him
gratefully
may
i
hope
that
in
my
capacity
of
walter
representative
i
have
chanced
in
a
measure
to
satisfy
your
taste
there
was
no
more
thought
of
refusing
chapter
vi
the
mottled
golden
tops
of
the
chestnuts
grew
paler
the
gaps
ever
wider
that
the
autumn
ate
into
the
foliage
where
a
soothing
green
had
cut
off
the
view
now
glittered
the
bright
wavelets
of
the
canal
long
barges
laboriously
pushed
by
poles
trailed
along
in
their
cumbersome
fashion
and
the
shaggy
watchdogs
barked
up
at
the
aristocratic
windows
grey
rainy
days
came
stealing
upon
the
city
like
an
enemy
and
loneliness
laid
its
octopus
clutch
on
lilly
breast
but
her
work
yes
she
had
her
work
so
long
as
the
first
infatuation
had
lasted
and
lilly
felt
she
might
hope
for
some
realisation
of
her
plans
she
had
clung
to
her
work
day
and
night
but
the
turn
of
events
never
came
the
announcements
she
had
had
printed
remained
unheeded
dehnicke
sole
purchaser
of
her
goods
begged
her
with
a
hesitating
embarrassed
manner
to
be
sure
yet
explicitly
enough
not
to
be
hasty
since
the
general
state
of
the
market
was
dull
by
degrees
her
zest
in
her
profession
began
to
languish
she
gave
up
going
to
kellermann
for
lessons
especially
since
his
insistence
upon
setting
free
his
chained
beauty
grew
steadily
more
annoying
she
locked
the
sample
closets
and
completed
none
but
the
pieces
dehnicke
ordered
oh
those
dark
pitiless
days
which
no
laughter
brightened
no
waiting
shortened
and
no
purpose
bound
together
the
kitchen
was
ruled
by
a
young
maid
ever
silent
whose
eyes
were
greedy
and
too
knowing
each
morning
while
the
little
canary
peeped
the
fish
were
given
fresh
water
it
was
somewhat
better
in
the
evening
when
the
lights
were
lit
and
the
crystal
chandelier
radiated
a
brilliant
white
light
lilly
would
then
wander
from
room
to
room
changing
the
position
of
this
or
that
ornament
and
constantly
reassuring
herself
how
beautifully
she
lived
and
how
happy
she
was
but
of
what
avail
was
the
old
rose
carpet
with
its
vague
vine
pattern
the
furniture
and
the
bronze
bodies
looking
as
if
a
golden
breath
had
blown
over
them
those
bronze
bodies
whose
innermost
being
after
all
was
nothing
more
than
a
zinc
alloy
having
originated
in
the
factory
of
liebert
dehnicke
of
what
avail
the
charming
secrétaire
and
the
writing
paper
with
the
golden
coronet
stamped
on
it
of
which
dehnicke
had
immediately
ordered
five
hundred
sheets
there
was
nobody
to
rejoice
with
her
nobody
whom
her
longing
brought
to
her
side
she
would
often
seat
herself
at
the
piano
and
let
her
fingers
stray
over
the
keys
but
she
did
not
get
the
pleasure
out
of
playing
that
she
had
anticipated
her
father
discipline
had
long
lost
its
effects
she
had
forgotten
the
pieces
she
had
once
known
by
heart
and
she
lacked
the
calm
and
patience
to
learn
all
over
again
yes
it
was
strange
what
disquiet
would
seize
her
the
instant
she
touched
the
keys
a
feeling
of
dread
an
anticipation
of
impending
danger
a
consciousness
of
her
own
unworthiness
she
could
not
keep
on
she
had
to
shut
down
the
lid
and
take
to
wandering
again
from
room
to
room
until
her
legs
wearied
and
ten
summoned
her
to
bed
in
those
joyless
unoccupied
days
a
piercing
stinging
desire
for
man
awoke
in
her
causing
her
nerves
to
tingle
and
a
sweet
tormenting
shudder
to
thrill
her
body
the
whole
of
the
two
long
years
her
senses
had
been
mute
tears
of
regret
had
drowned
that
which
the
colonel
senile
depravity
had
enkindled
and
the
weeks
of
love
with
walter
von
prell
had
fanned
into
lively
flames
drowned
it
forever
it
seemed
but
there
it
stood
again
transporting
and
shaming
and
refusing
to
be
silenced
by
prayers
or
reproach
often
she
felt
she
would
have
to
run
out
on
the
street
just
to
catch
the
glance
of
any
stranger
as
in
the
dresden
days
and
see
desire
flare
up
in
eyes
veiled
with
yearning
but
the
people
she
might
encounter
on
the
street
were
rough
and
common
the
mere
thought
of
them
made
her
tremble
the
only
time
she
went
out
was
to
visit
her
former
landlady
the
walk
lasted
a
full
hour
and
before
she
had
reached
her
former
home
many
a
naïve
admirer
many
a
keen
had
bobbed
up
beside
her
and
tried
to
enter
into
a
pleasant
conversation
she
always
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
shaking
herself
sometimes
yes
sometimes
she
would
have
liked
to
reply
when
she
lay
in
bed
with
closed
eyes
she
dreamed
of
sharply
cut
men
faces
to
which
she
looked
up
in
yielding
happiness
she
often
dreamed
too
of
dehnicke
good
sound
loyal
dehnicke
if
he
were
to
come
to
her
some
day
and
falter
in
that
guilty
way
of
his
which
she
liked
so
well
i
love
you
inordinately
and
want
you
to
marry
me
what
would
she
say
to
him
each
time
she
thought
this
a
furtive
sense
of
comfort
stole
over
her
as
for
the
man
who
by
full
right
stood
closest
to
her
she
never
dreamed
of
him
sometimes
it
is
true
when
her
longings
did
not
know
where
to
strike
root
those
anxious
yet
blissful
november
nights
would
recur
to
her
but
the
part
of
hero
might
have
been
played
by
any
other
man
as
well
as
walter
walter
himself
had
grown
to
be
a
sort
of
tyrannical
conscience
with
her
she
loved
him
of
course
how
could
she
help
loving
him
he
was
her
betrothed
and
he
was
working
for
her
but
sometimes
when
she
stood
in
front
of
the
sofa
and
felt
his
cold
blue
eyes
resting
upon
her
haughtily
and
masterfully
and
she
recalled
the
sorry
inconstant
little
fellow
he
actually
had
been
she
felt
a
desire
to
shake
off
everything
that
came
from
him
and
held
her
under
a
spell
as
one
tries
to
rid
oneself
of
a
preposterous
nightmare
if
only
dehnicke
had
not
kept
alluding
to
him
with
so
much
devotion
and
respect
treating
himself
as
the
modest
agent
who
would
have
to
render
account
to
his
dear
friend
when
that
dear
friend
would
return
in
honour
and
glory
dehnicke
came
punctually
twice
a
week
to
inquire
after
her
health
and
drink
tea
he
would
leave
in
time
to
reach
his
office
before
it
was
closed
for
the
day
these
scant
hours
were
always
a
festival
for
her
what
wonder
she
had
no
one
beside
him
he
was
the
only
person
who
bound
her
to
the
rest
of
the
world
and
brought
incident
and
interest
into
her
life
she
spent
hours
in
fixing
up
the
tea
table
in
trying
different
ways
of
lighting
the
room
in
arranging
the
flowers
and
standing
before
the
mirror
for
him
when
he
came
at
last
and
sat
opposite
her
they
conversed
long
and
seriously
about
the
cares
that
oppressed
him
the
plans
he
was
revolving
in
his
mind
his
disgust
at
the
artists
who
considered
it
a
disgrace
to
work
for
the
trade
and
did
so
only
if
the
pistol
was
held
to
their
heads
and
then
disdainfully
clenching
their
teeth
his
trashy
competitors
who
built
palaces
in
order
to
throw
dust
in
the
eyes
of
the
buyers
and
who
thereby
had
forced
him
to
transform
his
good
old
business
place
in
accordance
with
modern
ideas
of
decoration
most
distressing
of
all
was
his
clientele
the
artistic
ideals
of
the
metropolis
in
a
measure
made
a
moral
demand
upon
him
to
go
over
to
the
secession
and
place
on
the
market
bodies
in
distorted
attitudes
the
real
public
however
the
public
with
purchasing
power
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
all
that
rubbish
it
clung
to
knights
and
dames
to
maidens
plucking
flowers
or
carrying
water
to
fighting
stags
and
swinging
monkeys
so
he
stood
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
on
the
one
hand
was
the
danger
that
people
would
ridicule
him
as
on
the
other
hand
the
danger
of
losing
most
of
his
old
hereditary
customers
so
he
had
to
steer
carefully
along
a
middle
course
and
that
was
extremely
difficult
he
also
spoke
frequently
of
the
factory
with
its
hundreds
of
industrious
hands
who
laboured
day
after
day
for
the
prosperity
of
the
house
and
of
the
alterations
being
made
in
his
yard
and
sample
room
which
to
judge
by
the
architect
plans
and
the
sum
he
calculated
they
would
cost
would
produce
something
worth
seeing
but
what
does
competition
force
a
man
to
do
lilly
listened
with
shining
eyes
she
shared
in
all
his
activities
she
wanted
to
see
everything
and
experience
it
with
him
not
only
the
renovation
of
the
sample
room
but
also
the
doings
in
the
factory
with
its
machines
its
clatter
of
wheels
its
hissing
of
flames
and
screeching
of
files
she
never
wearied
of
questioning
she
had
to
know
how
the
workmen
looked
and
behaved
their
wages
their
lot
in
life
and
what
became
of
them
she
felt
that
there
in
his
factory
was
real
existence
while
her
life
was
nothing
but
a
dull
idle
waking
dream
oh
how
happy
you
must
be
she
often
cried
out
admiringly
to
have
so
many
souls
in
your
keeping
if
the
whole
bunch
of
them
did
keep
you
in
a
stew
all
the
time
he
rejoined
but
she
would
not
admit
the
qualification
he
was
certainly
a
beneficent
god
to
them
all
she
said
even
if
he
did
not
feel
it
himself
he
must
be
because
of
his
power
and
his
good
heart
dehnicke
gladly
listened
to
such
expressions
while
she
was
speaking
he
would
jump
up
abruptly
as
if
seized
by
a
mighty
revolutionary
idea
pace
up
and
down
the
room
excitedly
then
stop
in
front
of
her
and
stare
down
at
her
with
a
dark
solicitous
look
in
his
eyes
apparently
unable
to
reach
some
great
decision
against
which
he
was
struggling
lilly
pretended
not
to
notice
his
behaviour
though
she
knew
exactly
what
was
fermenting
in
his
soul
let
him
alone
do
help
him
she
thought
he
must
do
whatever
he
wants
to
do
of
his
own
impulse
otherwise
he
will
bear
me
a
grudge
if
only
there
had
been
that
hateful
sense
of
duty
toward
walter
which
like
herself
dehnicke
probably
felt
only
in
part
and
shammed
as
a
matter
of
decorum
there
was
something
else
that
gave
her
qualms
although
he
had
promised
to
he
had
never
fulfilled
the
wish
she
had
expressed
to
see
his
factory
however
he
spoke
openly
of
his
mother
and
did
not
shrink
from
confessing
how
greatly
she
had
influenced
him
though
lilly
could
read
into
his
words
that
he
wished
for
more
freedom
to
develop
his
powers
when
his
father
had
died
twelve
years
before
he
had
been
a
minor
and
had
had
to
yield
to
his
mother
guidance
the
old
lady
continued
to
maintain
her
authority
dehnicke
discussed
each
undertaking
with
her
and
if
she
approved
it
was
executed
even
if
he
did
not
concur
lilly
felt
a
dull
terror
arise
within
her
of
that
old
lady
who
sat
commandingly
in
her
behind
those
respectable
porcelain
flower
pots
and
directed
the
conduct
of
so
powerful
a
man
as
benefactor
her
heart
would
contract
when
she
imagined
her
first
meeting
with
the
old
lady
before
christmas
lilly
had
more
work
to
do
two
dozen
transparencies
had
been
ordered
and
had
to
be
completed
before
the
holidays
well
she
could
see
ahead
again
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
she
forgot
to
send
her
mother
a
christmas
gift
to
compensate
she
made
a
particularly
poetic
lamp
shade
and
had
it
delivered
anonymously
to
dehnicke
mother
the
day
before
christmas
she
herself
did
not
know
why
she
did
this
perhaps
it
was
a
sort
of
propitiatory
offering
such
as
timid
souls
were
wont
to
sacrifice
to
unknown
gods
as
an
expiation
for
unknown
sins
counting
upon
her
friend
coming
though
by
no
means
certain
he
would
she
had
made
a
little
heap
of
her
gifts
for
him
and
at
the
fall
of
dusk
with
throbbing
heart
began
to
listen
for
the
ring
of
the
door
bell
her
fears
were
idle
at
half
past
five
he
appeared
loaded
with
parcels
he
had
displayed
tact
in
his
choice
of
the
simple
presents
things
she
still
needed
in
the
apartment
a
few
embroidered
collars
a
boa
because
she
had
to
be
careful
of
her
sables
and
a
few
little
pieces
from
his
factory
to
adorn
the
empty
top
of
her
secrétaire
at
each
of
her
exclamations
of
delight
he
protested
mildly
the
things
really
came
from
walter
as
she
knew
and
what
comes
from
you
she
asked
nothing
he
replied
turning
his
palms
upward
i
know
of
something
you
could
give
me
that
walter
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
that
show
me
your
factory
this
time
he
did
not
evade
her
request
a
date
was
immediately
set
the
first
workday
after
new
year
when
everything
would
be
in
running
order
again
then
dehnicke
added
with
an
embarrassed
air
but
please
wear
something
dark
and
simple
why
asked
lilly
frightened
do
i
usually
dress
conspicuously
she
felt
as
if
some
one
had
boxed
her
ears
oh
not
that
but
your
good
clothes
might
be
soiled
on
january
the
second
at
about
noon
lilly
stood
in
front
of
the
house
in
alte
jakobstrasse
which
she
had
not
seen
since
she
had
paid
dehnicke
that
memorable
first
visit
in
his
office
it
has
almost
turned
out
to
be
a
path
of
destiny
after
all
she
thought
and
looked
up
furtively
at
the
porcelain
flower
pots
in
the
second
story
windows
she
started
it
seemed
to
her
a
white
head
had
moved
behind
the
lace
curtains
that
smacks
of
a
guilty
conscience
she
thought
and
with
awed
sidelong
glances
walked
past
the
door
that
opened
upon
the
broad
staircase
which
her
unworthy
feet
might
never
tread
until
she
had
been
received
into
the
circle
of
bourgeois
virtue
but
the
carriage
gate
stood
hospitably
open
the
scaffolding
had
been
removed
and
the
imitation
marble
of
walls
and
columns
shone
challengingly
in
their
variegated
colours
the
magnificence
of
the
courtyard
beyond
oppressed
her
heart
again
the
office
building
had
also
undergone
changes
the
plaster
had
given
place
to
a
broad
sandstone
façade
adorned
by
the
busts
of
eminent
artists
and
gilded
railings
gleamed
where
once
the
iron
staircase
had
been
there
was
her
friend
hurrying
down
the
steps
to
meet
her
despite
the
stinging
cold
he
wore
no
hat
in
holding
out
his
hand
to
her
he
cast
a
furtive
look
of
scrutiny
at
all
the
windows
it
seemed
he
too
had
a
guilty
conscience
he
first
led
her
to
the
sample
room
its
magnificence
exceeded
her
boldest
expectations
columned
halls
with
coffered
ceilings
stretched
out
in
a
long
vista
as
in
a
museum
there
were
endless
rows
of
tables
and
cases
on
which
gleaming
with
gold
and
silver
lights
sparkling
with
crystal
prisms
glowing
with
the
hot
red
of
copper
or
shading
off
softly
into
the
light
green
of
the
patina
stood
thousands
of
works
of
german
art
and
industry
imitation
bronzes
destined
to
fill
the
show
windows
of
shops
and
carry
the
semblance
of
prosperity
into
the
huts
of
the
poor
there
were
corpulent
begging
friars
dancing
gypsy
girls
clad
in
boleros
ogling
dandies
postillions
blowing
horns
pecking
chickens
dogs
fetching
game
calenders
set
in
frames
cigar
clips
in
the
shape
of
little
champagne
bottles
tall
pelicans
holding
lamps
in
their
bills
figurines
of
men
and
women
stretching
up
their
arms
just
as
in
kellermann
studio
though
here
not
aimlessly
since
they
bore
aloft
vases
candelabra
and
bowls
there
were
arbours
screening
love
couples
with
red
electric
bulbs
hidden
in
the
foliage
brownies
beside
shining
mushrooms
sea
shells
to
serve
as
ash
trays
snakes
writhing
about
the
chalices
of
flowers
or
about
porcelain
eggs
or
copper
dice
the
whole
pitifulness
of
a
vulgar
sense
of
art
seemed
to
have
crept
into
this
glittering
conglomeration
and
been
concentrated
there
ready
to
scatter
to
all
quarters
of
the
globe
when
lilly
gave
her
friend
a
questioning
or
astonished
look
because
of
some
monstrosity
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
observed
that
what
the
people
want
despite
some
dissatisfaction
with
what
she
saw
lilly
could
have
walked
up
and
down
for
hours
amid
all
that
sparkle
she
felt
she
belonged
there
by
right
had
she
been
asked
for
her
opinion
she
would
have
said
without
a
moment
reflection
throw
this
away
and
this
and
this
but
nobody
appealed
to
her
judgment
and
everything
went
its
way
without
her
dehnicke
then
took
her
to
the
factory
unfortunately
the
foundry
in
which
the
basic
part
of
all
the
work
is
done
happened
just
then
to
be
closed
through
an
open
window
lilly
saw
the
black
gaping
depths
of
the
hearths
about
which
dirty
troughs
were
standing
and
over
all
over
and
vessels
a
thick
layer
of
ashes
they
descended
a
flight
of
dirty
steps
and
passed
through
damp
rooms
smelling
of
all
sorts
of
poisons
where
rows
of
mighty
vats
stood
filled
with
vile
fluids
and
elderly
men
bustled
about
who
looked
like
sombre
scholars
whereas
they
were
nothing
more
than
mere
labourers
at
entrance
they
cast
a
look
of
surprise
at
her
then
concerned
themselves
about
her
no
further
and
they
did
not
greet
their
employer
this
is
the
galvanising
room
explained
dehnicke
and
continued
as
they
walked
past
the
vats
the
nickle
bath
steel
bath
silver
bath
and
so
on
up
in
a
loft
surrounded
by
an
iron
netting
the
wheels
of
a
machine
whirled
and
electric
bulbs
glittered
among
them
that
where
the
electric
current
is
generated
which
goes
through
the
different
baths
lilly
did
not
understand
but
she
enjoyed
the
inconceivable
rapidity
with
which
the
wheels
span
around
and
the
buzzing
sound
they
made
in
the
room
where
the
chasing
was
done
many
men
stood
at
long
tables
industriously
at
work
smoothing
down
the
unevennesses
of
the
cast
metal
and
preparing
the
separate
parts
of
an
ornament
for
joining
the
joining
was
done
in
the
next
room
where
the
flames
of
the
blowpipes
darted
and
hissed
and
little
clouds
of
metallic
vapour
shot
sparks
into
the
air
at
each
workman
place
lay
small
heaps
of
burnished
limbs
which
made
one
feel
sorry
for
the
truncated
body
from
which
they
seemed
to
have
been
severed
in
the
next
room
the
thinner
parts
were
beaten
into
shape
in
iron
dies
it
was
here
that
the
flowers
and
foliage
were
made
the
ribbons
and
vines
and
arabesques
everything
that
curled
and
dangled
daintily
the
workingmen
looked
all
the
coarser
and
unwieldier
by
contrast
they
scarcely
glanced
up
when
lilly
and
dehnicke
entered
and
continued
to
hammer
as
if
stupefied
into
dealing
those
blows
lilly
had
a
keener
eye
for
the
appearance
and
bearing
of
the
men
than
for
the
work
they
turned
out
she
made
comparisons
decided
who
was
well
off
and
who
in
distress
who
took
pleasure
in
his
work
and
who
went
through
the
day
toil
doggedly
because
driven
to
it
by
need
each
shop
had
its
peculiar
physiognomy
in
one
the
majority
looked
fresh
and
agile
in
another
galled
and
weary
and
now
as
often
before
when
dehnicke
had
spoken
to
her
of
his
employés
a
senseless
desire
arose
in
lilly
to
watch
over
the
fate
of
all
these
people
help
where
help
was
necessary
bring
sunshine
to
the
gloomy
and
relief
to
the
suffering
but
she
took
good
care
not
to
acquaint
dehnicke
with
her
absurd
ideas
now
we
will
see
the
most
delicate
of
all
the
operations
said
dehnicke
it
is
putting
on
the
patina
which
gives
the
pieces
their
real
style
he
opened
the
door
to
the
next
shop
and
the
smell
of
a
thousand
poisons
again
assailed
lilly
nostrils
here
there
were
women
at
work
also
side
by
side
with
the
men
they
applied
varnish
and
acids
and
brushed
and
rubbed
they
looked
sallow
and
jaded
at
lilly
entrance
they
were
so
taken
aback
that
they
dropped
their
brushes
and
cloths
and
stared
at
her
in
utter
astonishment
one
would
have
to
begin
with
these
to
win
the
confidence
of
all
lilly
thought
and
gave
them
a
cordial
nod
but
they
seemed
to
take
her
greeting
as
mockery
or
blame
and
turned
back
to
their
work
with
a
grimace
scornful
in
the
packing
room
where
women
and
children
were
employed
exclusively
lilly
appearance
produced
a
happier
impression
the
girls
laughed
and
whispered
and
nudged
one
another
with
their
elbows
the
only
one
who
paid
no
attention
to
her
was
a
pregnant
woman
who
seemed
to
find
it
difficult
to
keep
from
sinking
to
the
floor
she
held
her
drooping
lips
tightly
compressed
and
a
vivid
red
spotted
her
cheeks
nevertheless
her
arms
moved
in
feverish
haste
wrapping
one
paper
wisp
after
the
other
about
the
limbs
of
the
figure
standing
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
and
inclining
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
under
her
manipulations
lilly
led
dehnicke
aside
and
asked
may
i
give
her
something
she
being
provided
for
he
replied
unpleasantly
affected
it
seemed
he
quickly
opened
another
door
this
leads
to
the
store
room
where
the
pieces
are
kept
until
sold
with
the
exception
of
course
of
those
which
are
made
to
order
lilly
looked
down
a
dimly
lighted
corridor
from
which
the
cold
air
blew
upon
her
on
the
shelves
and
stands
stood
endless
rows
of
phantom
beings
shapeless
in
their
grey
paper
envelopes
oh
how
queer
said
lilly
shivering
a
little
and
preparing
to
walk
along
the
narrow
passageway
the
very
same
instant
however
she
noticed
her
friend
start
as
in
fright
and
cast
a
helpless
look
about
him
then
he
stepped
in
front
of
her
and
blocked
the
way
what
the
matter
asked
lilly
surprised
he
turned
colour
and
said
we
had
better
not
go
in
there
we
go
somewhere
else
besides
there
nothing
to
look
at
there
not
a
thing
you
yourself
see
there
is
he
planted
himself
squarely
in
front
of
her
so
that
she
could
not
possibly
look
down
the
long
line
of
shelves
this
of
course
merely
heightened
her
curiosity
but
i
would
like
to
she
said
and
assumed
the
haughty
expression
with
which
she
was
wont
to
get
her
way
with
him
no
no
he
burst
out
hastily
it
a
business
secret
i
betray
it
to
a
soul
even
the
employés
are
not
allowed
to
come
here
really
i
ca
permit
it
then
you
should
have
brought
me
here
at
all
said
lilly
feeling
insulted
and
she
turned
back
he
poured
forth
excuses
grew
hoarse
with
excitement
and
coughed
and
choked
then
he
led
her
back
over
the
resplendent
mosaic
of
the
yard
to
the
gateway
with
its
imitation
marble
columns
through
which
a
chilly
draught
was
blowing
you
will
catch
a
cold
said
lilly
to
hasten
her
departure
his
face
lighted
up
with
a
brilliant
idea
besides
you
know
he
said
the
store
room
was
heated
you
should
have
thought
of
that
sooner
rejoined
lilly
holding
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
of
partial
reconciliation
she
was
really
sorry
for
him
in
his
helpless
solicitude
nevertheless
she
continued
to
feel
hurt
and
a
bit
disturbed
the
day
she
had
been
looking
forward
to
so
happily
for
months
had
ended
in
a
discord
and
no
matter
how
much
she
pressed
him
later
dehnicke
refused
to
tell
her
what
mystery
lay
concealed
in
his
store
room
chapter
vii
lilly
began
to
ail
she
suffered
from
headaches
lassitude
insomnia
and
occasional
attacks
of
vertigo
the
physician
called
in
at
dehnicke
insistence
was
one
of
those
extremely
busy
men
who
make
the
rounds
of
numberless
houses
a
day
first
he
took
a
good
look
at
the
apartment
a
setting
he
seemed
to
know
then
upon
a
cursory
examination
prescribed
social
distractions
walks
and
iron
much
iron
social
distractions
had
to
be
dispensed
with
there
was
no
opportunity
for
them
taking
walks
was
not
so
easy
either
lilly
did
not
care
to
stroll
about
alone
and
dehnicke
the
only
person
to
accompany
her
preferred
not
to
be
seen
on
the
street
with
her
too
frequently
in
order
he
said
not
to
compromise
her
though
in
all
likelihood
the
truth
was
he
feared
becoming
conspicuous
by
appearing
in
public
with
that
exotic
flowerlike
beauty
for
no
matter
what
happened
no
matter
that
trouble
want
and
all
sorts
of
humiliations
swept
over
her
no
matter
that
boredom
and
displeasure
with
herself
crushed
her
spirits
lilly
appearance
never
lost
thereby
on
the
contrary
the
delicate
milky
whiteness
of
her
cheeks
which
before
had
been
a
golden
brown
lent
her
a
new
soft
charm
the
great
narrow
eyes
with
the
heavily
drooping
lids
those
improbable
lilly
eyes
now
had
a
weary
languishing
brilliance
as
if
they
veiled
all
the
painful
riddles
of
the
universe
moreover
the
last
year
had
given
back
to
her
the
slim
regal
figure
of
her
maiden
days
and
taken
away
the
womanly
peacefulness
it
had
acquired
at
lischnitz
no
wonder
that
many
a
head
turned
after
her
and
many
an
appreciative
envious
glance
was
sent
askance
at
her
companion
who
was
considerably
shorter
than
she
dehnicke
was
aware
of
all
this
and
being
a
staid
respectable
business
man
and
not
wishing
to
be
the
object
of
gossip
he
preferred
to
stay
indoors
with
her
about
the
middle
of
february
she
received
an
invitation
by
mail
from
kellermann
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
several
months
great
carnival
kellermann
studio
magic
lantern
show
flirtation
opportunity
for
crimes
passionels
cream
kisses
and
other
attractions
that
seemed
like
distraction
enough
and
dehnicke
who
it
happened
had
also
been
invited
was
so
energetic
in
his
persuasions
that
he
finally
conquered
her
timidity
and
induced
her
to
go
but
when
the
day
for
the
carnival
came
lilly
was
seized
by
a
great
dread
of
it
and
at
the
last
moment
felt
like
withdrawing
from
her
engagement
she
saw
herself
running
the
gauntlet
of
a
gaping
crowd
of
sardonic
sneerers
who
whispered
the
story
of
her
rise
and
fall
behind
her
back
she
saw
herself
neglected
and
avoided
the
object
of
derisive
side
glances
she
passed
through
all
the
tortures
of
the
déclassées
who
must
drag
through
life
with
the
mark
of
the
sinner
caught
in
the
act
branded
on
their
brows
she
chose
the
most
beautiful
of
her
dresden
dresses
which
in
the
two
years
had
grown
to
be
the
very
height
of
fashion
it
was
a
white
empire
gown
embroidered
with
gold
vines
she
arranged
a
narrow
bracelet
in
her
hair
like
a
diadem
and
loosely
laid
over
her
head
an
oriental
veil
shot
with
threads
of
gold
in
case
of
need
it
would
serve
to
conceal
the
bareness
of
her
bosom
when
she
had
completed
her
toilet
she
seemed
to
herself
so
repulsive
and
conspicuous
that
this
alone
was
sufficient
ground
for
not
showing
herself
she
did
not
venture
to
cherish
a
faint
hope
until
her
friend
came
to
fetch
her
he
saw
her
and
held
on
to
the
door
knob
uttering
a
slight
cry
of
astonishment
am
i
all
right
she
asked
with
a
diffident
laugh
which
entreated
encouragement
instead
of
replying
he
ran
up
and
down
the
room
breathing
heavily
and
choking
over
inarticulate
words
a
mute
language
which
lilly
immediately
understood
while
sitting
beside
him
in
the
coupé
she
succumbed
to
another
attack
of
dread
you
will
stay
right
next
to
me
wo
you
she
implored
you
leave
me
and
you
wo
let
a
stranger
speak
to
me
will
you
he
promised
all
she
wanted
four
flights
up
a
way
she
well
knew
the
landing
outside
kellermann
door
was
filled
with
on
which
furs
and
humiliating
lace
mantles
hung
she
clung
to
his
arm
now
to
her
ruin
the
large
anteroom
into
which
not
a
single
ray
of
light
penetrated
in
the
daytime
and
which
kellermann
used
as
a
kitchen
bedroom
and
had
been
converted
into
a
sort
of
fairy
forest
chinese
lanterns
swung
on
the
branches
of
pine
trees
and
in
their
dim
red
glow
several
couples
sat
smiling
and
whispering
on
narrow
bamboo
benches
they
were
so
absorbed
in
themselves
that
they
paid
little
heed
to
the
new
arrivals
all
the
more
animated
was
lilly
reception
in
the
studio
which
was
filled
with
a
bright
glittering
mass
of
humanity
a
general
ah
then
absolute
silence
a
passageway
naturally
formed
itself
down
which
the
couple
seemed
to
be
expected
to
pass
lilly
made
a
gesture
as
if
to
hide
behind
her
friend
but
he
reached
only
up
to
her
nose
at
the
same
instant
kellermann
came
hurrying
up
to
them
he
wore
a
brown
velvet
costume
consisting
of
a
jacket
breeches
and
a
phrygian
cap
everybody
in
fact
wore
what
seemed
to
him
original
and
becoming
welcome
goddess
queen
he
cried
in
a
voice
for
the
entire
company
to
hear
and
since
nothing
better
occurred
to
him
he
pressed
kisses
on
her
gloved
arm
from
wrist
to
elbow
then
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
show
her
the
incomparable
arrangements
of
his
new
court
of
love
she
followed
him
whispering
to
her
friend
to
be
sure
to
remain
at
her
side
electric
lights
had
been
hung
in
the
open
air
directly
over
the
skylight
converting
it
into
a
starry
heaven
on
looking
up
one
really
thought
a
thousand
little
suns
were
shining
down
from
out
of
the
night
rugs
and
ivy
vines
divided
the
left
side
where
the
gable
roof
sloped
downward
into
a
number
of
small
arbours
the
entrance
of
each
of
which
was
hung
with
gaily
coloured
bead
portières
and
over
each
hung
a
great
printed
placard
bearing
a
highly
suggestive
inscription
the
first
was
called
arbour
of
lax
morality
lilly
turned
a
startled
look
upon
her
guide
who
observed
with
a
smile
that
only
the
beginning
meant
for
and
little
like
you
and
added
this
is
but
an
intimation
of
more
wicked
adjuration
while
he
pointed
to
the
second
entrance
the
inscription
over
which
read
arbour
of
wicked
vows
oh
dreadful
she
cried
in
righteous
dismay
kellermann
rolled
with
laughter
she
could
not
help
reading
the
next
two
signs
arbour
of
the
right
to
motherhood
and
arbour
of
the
cry
for
man
but
she
said
nothing
more
there
were
two
more
divisions
a
powder
room
and
an
arbour
of
perversity
this
she
did
not
understand
now
we
go
to
the
criminal
side
said
kellermann
and
led
her
diagonally
across
the
room
making
way
for
her
among
the
people
who
at
her
approach
began
to
nod
and
hum
and
buzz
but
with
no
trace
of
malice
or
contempt
the
very
reverse
it
was
an
ovation
a
suppressed
demonstration
of
her
triumph
her
breast
expanded
a
faint
humble
sensation
of
happiness
stole
over
her
body
like
hot
wine
she
threw
back
her
scarf
she
no
longer
needed
to
feel
ashamed
of
her
bare
throat
and
shoulders
in
the
looks
turned
upon
her
she
read
that
no
one
would
scoff
at
her
she
did
not
succeed
in
reaching
the
criminal
side
so
many
gentlemen
wanted
to
be
presented
to
her
that
kellermann
had
all
he
could
do
telling
off
their
names
from
now
on
the
carnival
became
something
absolutely
unreal
a
dream
land
a
fairy
meadow
on
which
strange
flowers
were
blooming
and
sweet
scents
set
heads
and
a
haze
sparkled
with
red
suns
where
people
laughed
and
jested
and
whispered
where
bold
compliments
floated
in
the
air
and
everything
existed
for
lilly
to
caress
and
admire
and
love
yes
she
loved
them
all
the
men
and
the
women
as
soon
as
she
met
them
they
were
all
good
noble
souls
scintillating
with
delightful
conceits
and
ready
to
perform
friendly
services
each
awakened
a
new
hope
each
brought
a
new
joy
she
felt
how
her
cheeks
glowed
what
blissful
intoxication
was
burning
in
her
eyes
and
he
at
whom
she
looked
with
those
eyes
would
quiver
and
respond
with
a
gleam
from
his
own
which
seemed
to
be
the
reflection
of
her
happiness
that
was
no
longer
another
strange
lilly
who
laughed
and
returned
jest
with
jest
and
went
from
arm
to
arm
with
a
faint
pang
of
regret
that
was
she
herself
doubly
triply
herself
sometimes
when
a
gentleman
became
too
bold
in
his
talk
when
an
unlicenced
seemed
to
lurk
behind
a
joke
and
lilly
became
nervous
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
involuntarily
looked
around
for
help
she
always
found
her
friend
somewhere
near
at
hand
glancing
over
at
her
as
if
by
mere
chance
that
gave
her
a
delicious
sense
of
peace
a
consciousness
of
being
cared
for
and
hidden
away
so
that
she
could
be
even
merrier
than
before
and
need
not
take
offence
at
audacities
once
she
overheard
behind
her
who
the
lucky
dog
who
has
her
for
his
mistress
the
answer
was
a
little
polished
snooks
there
he
stands
this
made
her
stop
and
think
a
moment
though
she
could
not
know
to
whom
it
referred
but
in
the
whirl
of
incidents
it
soon
passed
from
her
mind
oh
what
people
she
met
there
were
young
blades
in
dress
suits
and
white
flowered
waistcoats
who
paid
her
mad
court
and
asked
as
if
casually
though
their
eagerness
was
visible
under
the
nonchalance
of
their
exterior
what
is
your
day
at
home
alas
she
had
no
day
at
home
she
lived
a
very
retired
life
there
were
sombre
philosophers
who
agonised
over
the
world
pain
wore
very
long
hair
and
monstrous
neckties
they
spoke
to
lilly
of
spiritual
high
pressure
and
the
specific
gravity
of
related
individualities
themes
which
did
lilly
soul
good
one
of
them
kept
addressing
her
as
your
excellency
when
she
asked
him
why
he
looked
staggered
and
said
he
had
heard
she
was
then
he
broke
off
and
substituted
the
paltry
joke
that
she
so
excelled
all
the
women
present
he
could
find
no
more
suitable
title
one
of
the
men
was
an
exuberant
old
high
liver
whose
name
she
had
read
with
awe
on
many
a
beautiful
picture
she
would
rather
have
kissed
the
hem
of
his
garment
than
see
him
dance
about
her
comically
trying
to
be
youthful
there
were
many
others
who
aroused
her
curiosity
but
she
could
learn
nothing
of
their
rank
or
character
the
company
even
boasted
a
real
prince
a
pale
blond
very
young
man
who
did
not
venture
to
ask
to
be
introduced
to
lilly
because
his
love
was
always
in
threatening
proximity
so
he
kept
making
détours
about
her
the
women
of
course
were
more
distant
than
the
men
though
those
of
them
who
came
to
make
her
acquaintance
gave
themselves
up
to
her
with
effusive
warmth
one
was
a
beautiful
voluptuous
brunette
with
unsteady
glowing
eyes
and
a
smile
betokening
wild
abandon
we
must
get
to
know
each
other
she
said
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
friend
and
later
we
take
supper
together
like
a
cosy
little
family
another
was
an
extremely
slim
young
woman
with
bright
blue
eyes
who
towered
above
most
of
the
men
she
wandered
through
the
throng
serene
and
unconcerned
in
a
long
white
silk
secession
robe
looking
like
a
phantom
she
spoke
without
moving
her
head
and
smiled
without
drawing
her
lips
she
had
come
from
denmark
to
study
painting
and
at
the
same
time
live
life
as
she
expressed
it
who
are
you
she
asked
lilly
you
are
different
from
the
rest
the
woman
who
comes
here
and
does
not
want
to
be
swept
along
in
the
current
must
have
strong
arms
she
boldly
threw
back
the
wide
sleeves
of
her
gown
as
far
as
her
shoulders
and
exposed
two
wonderfully
curved
arms
gleaming
like
marble
pillars
thereupon
she
wandered
further
the
third
was
an
extremely
very
elegant
woman
no
longer
young
her
pretty
face
was
tanned
by
the
open
air
with
a
merry
flash
of
her
eyes
she
held
out
her
hand
to
lilly
as
if
they
were
old
acquaintances
oh
how
sweet
and
lovely
you
are
she
said
softly
we
have
all
flown
here
and
do
know
how
but
where
do
come
from
my
name
is
she
mentioned
the
name
of
a
great
musician
who
in
kilian
czepanek
home
had
been
revered
as
yes
welter
former
wife
that
who
i
am
she
added
gaily
and
turned
to
the
gentleman
on
whose
arm
she
had
walked
up
to
lilly
another
general
wife
like
myself
thought
lilly
looking
after
her
there
were
some
married
couples
too
for
the
most
part
extremely
young
and
extravagantly
clad
who
at
first
kept
together
timidly
and
looked
about
with
great
astonished
eyes
and
later
frolicked
about
like
monkeys
set
at
liberty
one
couple
seemed
to
have
been
dragged
to
the
carnival
as
a
practical
joke
the
husband
was
a
genuine
complacent
beery
german
the
wife
a
good
corpulent
creature
the
man
lilly
was
told
was
the
landlord
of
the
house
a
baker
who
had
been
invited
to
the
carnival
as
a
reward
for
having
permitted
his
fourth
floor
to
be
turned
but
the
couple
by
no
means
felt
nervous
or
out
of
place
they
made
coarse
clumsy
jokes
and
were
always
surrounded
by
a
group
of
laughing
auditors
about
ten
lilly
had
just
been
entangled
by
one
of
the
and
linenless
in
a
profound
discussion
of
false
human
values
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
sort
of
cry
of
wrath
was
raised
issuing
at
first
from
only
one
or
two
throats
then
swelling
to
a
loud
thunder
lilly
distinguished
the
words
hunger
and
fodder
kellermann
pacifying
voice
resounded
to
still
the
clamour
an
accident
he
said
had
occurred
to
interrupt
the
spreading
of
the
bread
of
which
each
guest
would
receive
a
piece
a
poor
devil
of
an
artist
could
afford
a
more
abundant
repast
he
had
hurriedly
sent
across
the
street
for
what
was
missing
and
would
the
gentlemen
please
content
themselves
until
it
arrived
as
for
those
who
were
hungry
and
did
not
worry
about
the
taking
of
human
life
the
hosts
had
provided
arsenic
sandwiches
and
strychnine
tarts
which
were
to
be
found
in
the
closet
marked
poisons
the
whole
assemblage
made
a
dash
for
the
criminal
side
where
for
the
sake
of
the
a
whole
arsenal
of
deadly
instruments
had
been
prepared
gallows
dangled
from
the
ceiling
ladders
led
down
to
abysses
and
a
cannon
was
discharged
the
company
immediately
snatched
the
poisonous
sandwiches
from
the
sideboard
and
sometimes
even
absolute
strangers
offered
one
another
a
bite
like
school
children
then
came
the
regular
supper
a
buffet
had
been
set
up
among
the
pines
in
the
anteroom
piled
mountain
high
with
all
sorts
of
goodies
yorkshire
hams
cold
game
lobster
sliced
salmon
and
heaven
knows
what
else
so
stormy
was
the
onslaught
on
that
buffet
which
providentially
had
been
placed
against
a
wall
that
the
forest
of
pines
gave
way
twigs
flew
about
branches
broke
and
a
mass
of
laughing
cursing
creatures
rolled
among
the
overturned
somebody
had
a
brilliant
idea
chuck
the
whole
forest
down
stairs
forthwith
the
chinese
lanterns
were
extinguished
and
despite
the
protestations
of
the
landlord
who
feared
for
the
sleep
of
his
other
tenants
tree
after
tree
went
crashing
down
the
steps
and
piled
up
at
the
bottom
the
ladies
light
dresses
were
completely
strewn
with
pine
needles
pine
needles
settled
in
their
hair
and
on
their
bosoms
the
whole
place
smelled
of
christmas
one
could
hardly
enjoy
eating
for
all
the
laughing
besides
there
were
not
enough
chairs
and
tables
for
everybody
so
to
be
able
at
least
to
balance
the
plate
on
their
laps
they
sat
crowded
close
up
against
one
another
on
the
stairs
where
the
company
was
fed
from
above
downward
each
time
fresh
provisions
were
procured
from
the
buffet
and
brought
out
into
the
hall
some
enterprising
pioneers
even
climbed
up
on
the
heap
of
pine
trees
and
swayed
on
the
springy
branches
like
birds
benevolent
souls
on
the
upper
landing
handed
them
their
food
on
forks
tied
to
walking
sticks
lilly
fairly
sick
with
laughter
sat
on
one
of
the
steps
quite
surrounded
by
strange
gentlemen
all
of
whom
wanted
to
be
fed
by
her
she
was
in
such
a
state
of
beatitude
that
she
wished
her
life
might
end
with
the
carnival
if
she
had
any
care
in
the
world
it
was
to
see
to
it
that
the
gentlemen
about
her
got
enough
to
eat
the
last
of
the
refreshments
were
the
cream
kisses
promised
on
the
invitation
they
swung
on
long
strings
from
the
ceiling
and
each
guest
had
to
snap
like
a
dog
for
his
portion
if
anyone
used
his
hands
he
was
rapped
over
the
knuckles
this
sport
which
at
first
created
fresh
storms
of
folly
soon
had
to
be
relinquished
because
the
cream
dropped
on
the
ladies
dresses
empire
gown
was
also
stained
but
the
instant
the
cream
fell
on
it
one
of
the
gentlemen
kneeled
and
sucked
the
spot
away
when
a
trumpet
blast
summoned
the
company
back
to
the
studio
everybody
was
unhappy
lilly
in
especial
but
when
she
saw
her
friend
again
whom
she
had
quite
forgotten
she
quickly
took
comfort
pressing
against
his
arm
and
beaming
with
delight
she
reported
to
him
amid
gurgles
of
laughter
all
she
had
experienced
in
the
meantime
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
again
saw
the
looks
of
those
who
passed
her
fastened
on
her
face
in
strange
seriousness
betokening
something
like
compassion
but
she
had
too
much
to
relate
to
give
those
strange
looks
much
thought
the
speeches
now
began
lilly
begged
her
friend
to
stay
at
her
side
she
had
romped
enough
she
said
and
needed
something
homey
he
pressed
his
arm
against
hers
gratefully
why
are
you
trembling
so
she
asked
in
surprise
oh
nothing
he
replied
lightly
the
first
of
the
speakers
was
one
of
the
linenless
sombre
ones
something
weighty
and
solemn
like
a
hymn
was
to
usher
in
the
numbers
on
the
program
he
recited
an
ode
entitled
in
which
such
words
as
sublime
mist
rhymed
with
amethyst
and
with
passionate
fire
lilly
understood
not
a
word
though
the
poem
must
have
been
very
beautiful
because
at
the
conclusion
the
gentlemen
burst
into
wild
applause
bravo
bravo
more
the
sombre
poet
who
naturally
interpreted
these
exclamations
as
a
call
for
bowed
and
felt
flattered
and
started
off
again
an
ode
he
found
he
was
in
for
it
enough
enough
came
from
all
sides
and
it
turned
out
that
the
gentlemen
had
merely
wished
to
express
their
desire
for
something
smokeable
in
the
language
of
the
next
to
ascend
the
platform
was
a
slim
very
elegant
gentleman
with
a
dark
brown
van
dyke
beard
and
a
gleaming
monocle
he
had
been
introduced
to
lilly
salmoni
smiled
sadly
and
held
his
curved
left
hand
close
to
his
nose
to
scrutinise
his
long
nails
his
intention
he
said
was
to
draw
up
an
intellectual
inventory
of
the
evening
for
the
purpose
he
would
make
a
few
remarks
as
a
basis
of
his
destructive
construction
of
this
social
heterogeneity
with
that
a
of
audacities
and
personalities
came
rattling
down
on
the
heads
of
hosts
and
guests
though
lilly
understood
only
a
fraction
of
what
he
said
she
felt
she
had
to
blush
with
shame
for
each
person
his
words
hit
but
strange
to
say
nobody
took
offence
on
the
contrary
each
one
upon
getting
his
raking
tried
to
outdo
the
others
in
noisy
applause
what
a
happy
world
thought
lilly
where
people
have
become
absolutely
invulnerable
and
the
most
heinous
sins
simply
add
to
their
honour
her
own
misdeed
from
which
she
had
suffered
so
long
as
from
a
festering
sore
suddenly
appeared
something
like
a
child
amiable
prank
was
it
idiocy
in
me
to
grieve
so
she
asked
herself
and
pushed
her
hips
downward
with
her
hands
as
if
to
brush
away
all
the
old
chains
from
her
limbs
the
elegant
doctor
could
deal
in
compliments
also
each
of
the
lovely
women
received
her
little
rolled
in
pepper
and
when
he
spoke
of
a
lotos
flower
that
had
drifted
there
from
fairyland
and
still
seemed
to
dread
the
glory
of
the
new
sun
shining
upon
it
lilly
again
saw
all
glances
turned
upon
her
but
let
her
take
courage
salmoni
continued
should
she
need
some
one
to
help
her
dreamily
await
the
night
she
may
count
i
feel
certain
upon
every
one
of
us
he
was
rewarded
with
the
enthusiastic
applause
of
all
the
gentlemen
and
lilly
did
not
even
feel
ashamed
upon
concluding
and
after
gathering
in
a
harvest
of
praise
from
the
auditors
who
crowded
up
to
him
those
who
had
gotten
the
hottest
roast
were
the
most
eager
he
stepped
to
lilly
side
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
most
humbly
for
having
mentioned
you
in
the
same
breath
as
this
set
people
on
our
level
ought
to
have
a
tacit
code
they
ought
to
understand
each
other
without
making
bald
declarations
but
i
was
tired
of
just
cracking
a
whip
besides
i
may
assure
you
i
play
the
fool
he
stuck
his
monocle
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
looked
at
lilly
with
his
sharp
grey
eyes
as
if
to
tear
her
heart
to
tatters
people
on
our
level
he
had
said
lilly
felt
flattered
that
so
clever
and
prominent
a
man
should
rank
her
with
him
the
next
performer
was
a
minstrel
a
mercurial
black
young
fellow
who
accompanied
himself
on
the
mandolin
he
struck
up
a
highly
sentimental
ditty
like
a
troubadour
the
lady
name
i
will
not
cite
far
purer
she
than
the
moonlight
she
is
so
chaste
she
burns
with
shame
to
hear
the
stork
called
by
its
name
and
if
rash
eros
bids
you
try
to
steal
a
kiss
however
shy
her
face
grows
pale
heaven
forefend
and
stammers
she
now
this
must
end
the
second
strophe
the
temperature
of
which
rose
many
degrees
ended
with
the
line
quoth
she
now
cut
it
out
now
stop
and
the
third
strophe
whose
outrageous
explicitness
lilly
scarcely
ventured
to
understand
wound
up
with
the
french
ce
que
vous
voulez
mais
pas
an
endless
round
of
clapping
and
shouting
followed
the
song
lilly
was
astonished
but
did
not
resent
it
she
resented
nothing
any
more
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
eyes
she
let
the
lights
the
sounds
the
vulgarities
the
laughter
and
applause
pass
as
in
a
dream
from
time
to
time
she
looked
around
at
her
friend
he
stood
behind
her
and
smiled
reassuringly
but
said
nothing
a
mottled
red
burned
on
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
perhaps
he
had
drunk
too
much
champagne
as
for
herself
though
she
had
taken
only
a
sip
her
head
was
spinning
dizzily
at
two
the
ended
now
the
final
restraints
were
thrust
aside
the
company
romped
madly
danced
kissed
drank
quarrelled
and
fought
duels
lovers
stabbed
themselves
and
were
carried
out
dead
the
cannon
shot
off
crackers
a
thin
droll
youngster
clad
in
a
greek
gown
which
an
obliging
model
had
lent
him
stood
in
front
of
the
arbour
of
the
right
to
motherhood
and
held
forth
in
a
singing
falsetto
science
had
shown
he
said
by
the
results
of
artificial
fish
culture
that
man
as
a
factor
in
reproduction
would
soon
be
unnecessary
at
the
entrance
to
the
arbour
of
the
cry
for
man
a
small
wild
person
with
curly
black
hair
had
climbed
on
a
chair
and
kept
screaming
a
woman
a
woman
a
woman
into
the
arbour
of
perversity
they
had
pushed
the
baker
and
his
corpulent
better
half
and
each
time
the
two
kissed
on
command
a
shout
of
laughter
went
up
outside
lilly
head
was
with
the
tumult
everything
turned
in
a
circle
screeching
darting
hammering
like
a
series
of
painful
flashes
we
better
be
going
dehnicke
voice
behind
her
advised
she
arose
and
stretched
her
arms
with
a
shiver
had
been
life
life
life
then
she
followed
him
kellermann
had
noticed
her
leave
and
furtively
slipped
up
to
her
in
the
hall
his
open
collar
hung
over
his
jacket
his
cheeks
were
puffed
and
shiny
he
looked
like
a
young
falstaff
he
exchanged
glances
with
dehnicke
who
nodded
slightly
as
if
to
say
it
was
all
right
and
went
off
in
search
of
their
wraps
the
instant
dehnicke
was
lost
among
the
overcoats
kellermann
turned
to
lilly
and
whispered
the
chained
beauty
have
you
forgotten
her
entirely
entirely
she
replied
with
a
languid
smile
you
never
come
never
and
i
tell
you
he
led
her
to
one
side
next
to
the
banisters
i
tell
you
you
come
when
your
own
chains
have
cut
into
your
flesh
and
you
wo
know
dehnicke
returned
with
the
wraps
and
kellermann
became
silent
lilly
was
keyed
up
to
too
blissful
a
pitch
to
attach
any
significance
to
these
strange
words
which
sounded
like
a
joke
in
the
mouth
of
the
bacchic
faun
she
laughed
at
him
the
lightning
flashes
that
had
darted
through
her
brain
died
down
leaning
lightly
against
her
friend
shoulder
she
walked
airily
down
the
steps
singing
and
swaying
her
hips
the
whole
world
seemed
to
have
passed
into
a
soft
perfumed
chiming
twilight
snow
had
fallen
and
the
moon
was
shining
dehnicke
carriage
was
waiting
let
us
drive
to
the
tiergarten
lilly
suggested
she
could
not
draw
in
her
fill
of
the
invigorating
snowy
air
she
threw
herself
against
the
cushioned
back
of
the
brougham
and
sang
and
beat
time
with
her
feet
he
sat
in
his
corner
quite
still
looking
out
into
the
night
do
say
something
she
cried
what
shall
i
say
he
rejoined
and
sedulously
looked
past
her
with
his
bleared
eyes
they
rolled
silently
along
under
the
trees
from
which
every
now
and
then
a
little
silver
star
was
brushed
into
the
carriage
lilly
sank
into
a
drowsy
state
oh
she
whispered
seeking
a
prop
for
her
head
i
could
ride
on
this
way
forever
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
her
that
walter
arm
was
clasping
her
waist
and
her
left
cheek
was
nestling
comfortably
against
neck
as
once
on
blessed
november
nights
but
where
did
walter
come
from
all
of
a
sudden
she
started
up
and
sank
back
wide
awake
no
that
was
not
walter
now
she
knew
exactly
who
it
was
but
her
great
shame
kept
her
from
changing
her
position
and
for
a
while
she
lay
with
her
eyes
wide
open
listening
to
his
heart
it
throbbed
even
in
his
upper
arm
and
he
will
not
ask
the
price
which
it
is
the
custom
in
our
country
to
demand
of
beautiful
women
was
what
walter
had
written
he
was
demanding
it
after
all
how
contemptuously
walter
would
look
down
on
her
when
she
would
turn
on
the
lights
in
her
half
an
hour
later
walter
whom
everybody
including
the
man
into
whose
arms
she
had
glided
considered
to
be
her
betrothed
walter
to
whom
she
must
be
true
as
long
as
there
was
salvation
for
her
on
earth
to
be
sure
it
was
heavenly
to
be
lying
there
that
way
she
felt
she
had
a
place
in
the
universe
and
how
horrible
that
loneliness
had
been
but
now
it
availed
nothing
cautiously
as
if
fearing
to
hurt
him
she
withdrew
from
his
arm
and
pressed
against
the
other
side
of
the
brougham
why
did
you
stay
he
asked
stammering
like
a
drunkard
you
comfortable
she
shook
her
head
he
repeated
the
question
several
times
she
maintained
silence
she
felt
any
word
she
might
utter
would
entangle
her
still
further
then
he
clasped
her
hand
which
hung
down
limply
i
may
she
whispered
extracting
her
hand
from
his
and
you
may
either
why
may
we
you
will
reproach
yourself
dreadfully
later
when
you
recall
you
are
responsible
to
him
whom
he
asked
whom
whom
else
you
always
say
you
nothing
but
his
agent
and
a
laugh
a
hoarse
guilty
laugh
interrupted
her
he
had
folded
his
hands
across
his
knees
and
he
laughed
and
drew
a
deep
breath
and
laughed
again
as
one
who
has
rid
himself
of
a
wearisome
burden
a
horrid
certainty
faced
her
then
all
that
was
true
she
faltered
staring
at
him
nonsense
perfect
nonsense
he
cried
he
wrote
me
before
he
left
for
the
united
states
out
for
her
do
let
her
go
to
the
dogs
she
too
good
for
them
nothing
else
and
never
again
there
now
you
know
it
now
i
rid
of
it
i
had
a
hard
enough
time
over
it
but
what
could
i
do
i
had
begun
so
i
had
to
go
on
there
was
no
use
he
jerked
up
the
window
and
leaned
against
it
panting
lilly
wanted
to
ask
why
did
you
do
it
but
was
afraid
to
she
knew
what
was
coming
one
thing
stood
before
her
with
horrible
clearness
she
was
in
his
hands
beyond
rescue
she
lived
in
his
house
spent
his
money
saw
the
world
with
his
eyes
she
was
what
he
had
determined
she
should
be
his
courtesan
his
creature
the
river
she
tore
at
the
brougham
door
and
set
her
right
foot
on
the
step
but
he
pulled
her
back
and
shut
the
door
again
be
sensible
he
commanded
keep
your
wits
about
you
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
weeping
piteous
harrowing
heartbreaking
she
had
not
shed
such
tears
since
the
days
of
her
divorce
she
saw
nothing
and
heard
nothing
sometimes
she
seemed
to
catch
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
from
a
great
great
distance
but
she
did
not
understand
what
he
said
simply
to
cry
cry
cry
as
if
salvation
lay
in
crying
as
if
fear
and
distress
would
flow
away
with
her
tears
the
brougham
came
to
a
stand
she
felt
herself
being
lifted
out
he
carried
the
key
in
his
pocket
supported
by
him
she
stumbled
up
the
steps
and
thought
from
time
to
time
why
i
was
going
to
throw
myself
into
the
river
he
led
her
to
the
sofa
and
turned
on
the
lights
of
the
chandelier
then
he
undid
the
buckle
of
her
cloak
and
removed
the
veil
from
her
hair
she
lay
there
languidly
looking
apathetically
at
the
tablecloth
the
bird
awoke
and
peeped
to
her
it
late
she
heard
dehnicke
say
and
the
carriage
is
waiting
but
i
ca
leave
you
this
way
i
must
vindicate
myself
i
want
you
to
know
how
everything
happened
it
makes
no
difference
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
to
me
it
does
he
rejoined
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
a
rascal
that
makes
no
difference
either
she
thought
i
loved
you
he
began
long
before
i
knew
you
when
you
were
still
our
colonel
wife
she
looked
up
at
him
in
surprise
as
he
stood
there
in
his
short
dress
suit
with
a
pale
joyless
pleading
face
uneasily
plucking
at
the
tablecloth
he
who
was
really
master
there
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
looking
upon
him
for
the
first
time
i
had
been
called
into
service
for
the
manoeuvres
that
summer
he
continued
and
the
club
was
still
full
of
you
even
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
talked
of
nothing
else
there
were
ever
so
many
pictures
of
you
too
in
circulation
some
of
the
men
had
snapped
you
on
the
sly
the
instant
i
saw
you
i
should
have
recognised
you
because
i
remembered
every
feature
yes
i
may
repeat
with
perfect
truth
i
loved
you
even
then
what
more
after
prell
letter
came
and
you
were
to
step
into
my
life
good
lord
what
plans
for
winning
you
did
i
work
out
in
those
one
and
a
half
years
then
at
last
you
appeared
and
exceeded
my
wildest
fancies
but
when
i
saw
that
in
between
you
had
become
a
and
how
devoted
you
were
to
walter
you
kept
talking
of
him
i
lost
my
last
hopes
of
course
i
had
never
seriously
counted
upon
winning
you
because
though
i
lay
some
stock
in
myself
i
not
really
and
besides
to
have
some
one
like
you
for
a
love
more
happiness
than
anyone
can
dream
of
when
he
said
a
love
passionate
bitterness
welled
up
within
lilly
to
have
me
for
a
wife
she
thought
is
certainty
more
happiness
than
anyone
can
dream
of
she
burst
out
laughing
he
took
her
laugh
as
a
sign
of
modest
deprecation
of
his
compliment
and
talked
himself
into
greater
enthusiasm
did
she
think
a
single
person
in
all
that
company
was
worthy
of
unlacing
her
did
she
realise
how
immeasurably
she
was
raised
above
everything
bearing
the
name
woman
from
out
of
her
eyes
the
question
now
candidly
shone
which
pride
and
shame
forbade
her
to
utter
he
must
have
understood
because
he
paused
suddenly
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
looked
agitated
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
suppressing
sobs
she
heard
him
murmur
i
ca
impossible
i
ca
oh
if
he
ca
she
thought
and
stared
at
him
with
her
cheeks
pressed
between
her
hands
he
halted
in
front
of
her
and
tried
to
talk
but
he
could
only
choke
down
words
and
he
took
to
pacing
the
room
again
lilly
caught
snatches
of
words
mother
never
persuade
her
must
give
up
the
business
and
again
and
again
i
ca
impossible
i
ca
he
right
she
thought
a
person
like
me
he
really
ca
and
feeling
her
renunciation
was
final
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
collapsed
he
hastened
to
her
frightened
leaned
over
her
and
wanted
to
stroke
her
hands
but
she
shook
him
off
since
he
could
not
find
a
word
in
justification
of
his
weak
evasion
he
took
up
the
thread
where
tortured
laugh
had
cut
it
off
remember
one
thing
dearest
dearest
friend
i
do
want
anything
for
myself
no
reward
nothing
long
ago
i
gave
up
all
wishes
for
myself
i
swear
to
you
the
only
thing
i
wanted
was
to
draw
you
out
of
the
hole
where
you
were
being
degraded
into
a
proletarian
oh
i
know
it
from
experience
it
lasts
a
few
years
no
more
they
either
go
on
the
street
or
they
grow
more
careworn
and
uglier
and
uglier
soon
you
never
suspect
what
they
once
were
to
keep
the
same
thing
from
happening
to
you
i
thought
of
that
device
of
the
check
and
wrote
to
my
american
agents
when
i
saw
you
were
completely
taken
in
i
did
sleep
for
several
nights
out
of
pure
joy
because
then
i
knew
i
should
have
to
stand
by
and
see
you
go
to
your
ruin
why
should
i
go
to
ruin
lilly
interjected
by
the
time
your
check
came
i
had
already
earned
a
decent
little
sum
you
yourself
helped
me
and
you
yourself
said
if
i
continued
the
same
way
she
stopped
short
in
fright
at
the
thought
that
if
she
had
to
separate
from
him
this
one
avenue
would
be
cut
off
too
the
idea
was
a
nightmare
no
word
of
encouragement
came
from
him
he
kept
plucking
at
the
tablecloth
in
dogged
reserve
say
something
have
you
already
forgotten
everything
you
did
for
me
he
raised
his
head
well
he
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
if
you
insist
at
any
rate
it
may
be
well
to
be
perfectly
frank
this
evening
why
what
else
is
there
lilly
cried
do
you
remember
when
you
visited
the
factory
i
would
let
you
into
the
storeroom
certainly
but
what
and
afterwards
i
said
it
was
because
the
room
was
heated
yes
but
i
ca
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
my
work
if
you
had
gone
the
least
little
bit
further
you
would
have
seen
every
one
of
your
transparencies
in
all
the
last
were
still
unwrapped
lilly
looked
up
at
him
as
to
her
executioner
then
she
fell
down
before
the
sofa
she
had
no
more
tears
to
shed
but
the
soft
darkness
of
the
cushions
was
soothing
to
her
eyes
to
see
nothing
more
to
hear
nothing
more
to
think
nothing
more
to
die
quickly
forthwith
before
hunger
came
and
shame
a
long
silence
followed
she
thought
he
had
already
gone
when
she
felt
his
hand
stroking
her
shoulder
and
heard
his
voice
with
a
mournful
quiver
in
it
pleading
my
dear
dear
friend
tell
me
me
what
could
i
do
could
i
rob
you
of
your
one
pleasure
your
one
assurance
was
i
to
say
to
you
amateurish
unsalable
i
saw
your
whole
soul
was
wrapped
up
in
it
and
you
lived
from
it
spiritually
as
it
were
i
thought
her
affairs
are
all
smoothed
out
i
just
let
it
die
a
natural
death
and
you
know
it
was
in
a
fair
way
to
die
naturally
you
hardly
thought
of
it
the
last
month
dearest
dearest
friend
do
reflect
what
wrong
did
i
do
i
helped
you
out
of
wretched
surroundings
i
gave
you
a
few
months
of
joy
and
freedom
from
care
and
i
did
even
ask
for
so
much
as
a
kiss
if
you
want
return
to
your
laue
and
it
will
be
as
if
nothing
happened
or
remain
here
quite
calmly
until
you
have
found
a
position
i
wo
thrust
myself
on
you
you
need
see
me
when
i
leave
here
now
he
could
not
continue
after
a
period
of
silence
lilly
raised
her
head
in
fright
and
curiosity
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
she
found
him
in
a
chair
inclined
over
the
table
his
head
hidden
in
his
arms
and
his
back
shaken
with
mute
sobs
she
stood
next
to
him
a
while
and
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
was
so
sorry
for
him
oh
how
sorry
she
was
for
him
then
she
gently
laid
her
hand
on
his
hair
take
comfort
dear
friend
she
said
it
will
be
much
worse
for
me
than
for
you
i
wo
have
anybody
at
all
and
she
shuddered
thinking
of
her
approaching
loneliness
he
straightened
himself
up
and
silently
reached
for
his
hat
his
eyes
were
even
more
bleared
than
before
his
head
inclined
still
further
to
the
left
oh
how
sorry
she
was
for
him
he
said
pressing
her
right
hand
and
thank
you
i
will
write
to
you
she
said
i
should
like
to
think
it
all
over
i
shall
probably
move
immediately
whatever
you
wish
he
said
as
he
was
drawing
on
his
overcoat
something
long
and
cylindrical
gleaming
with
gold
and
silver
fell
noiselessly
from
his
pocket
to
the
floor
lilly
picked
it
up
it
was
a
huge
cracker
both
had
to
smile
that
lovely
carnival
had
to
have
this
sad
ending
she
said
he
sighed
did
you
enjoy
yourself
i
hope
for
that
at
least
oh
what
the
difference
so
far
as
i
concerned
said
lilly
deprecatingly
a
great
difference
the
whole
affair
was
gotten
up
for
you
how
for
me
well
do
you
suppose
kellermann
who
at
the
very
best
earns
fifty
to
a
hundred
marks
a
week
can
afford
such
an
entertainment
the
physician
ordered
diversion
and
on
account
of
the
position
you
are
in
i
could
offer
you
any
so
i
hid
behind
him
and
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
if
he
loved
her
to
that
extent
you
dear
dear
friend
she
said
and
for
one
instant
lightly
leaned
her
head
against
his
shoulder
he
threw
his
arms
about
her
quickly
greedily
as
if
she
would
be
snatched
from
him
the
next
instant
his
whole
body
quivered
and
she
felt
his
warm
tears
on
her
forehead
since
he
did
not
venture
to
kiss
her
even
yet
she
offered
him
her
lips
the
third
she
thought
when
she
glanced
up
she
saw
walter
eyes
on
the
wall
looking
down
at
her
with
a
base
sneering
smile
just
as
she
had
feared
in
the
carriage
terrified
she
drew
dehnicke
attention
to
the
portrait
we
better
have
it
sent
right
down
to
the
basement
he
said
and
since
they
now
had
very
much
to
say
to
each
other
the
carriage
was
immediately
dismissed
because
it
was
half
past
three
and
the
coachman
and
the
horses
needed
a
rest
chapter
viii
a
new
life
began
for
lilly
once
again
an
end
to
her
loneliness
every
afternoon
dehnicke
came
for
his
cup
of
tea
and
now
he
was
no
longer
dehnicke
he
was
richard
dear
beloved
richard
to
whom
one
waved
and
nodded
cheerily
from
the
window
whom
one
received
with
outstretched
arms
in
front
of
the
apartment
door
against
whose
knees
one
crouched
on
the
floor
and
from
whose
forehead
one
smoothed
away
the
naughty
frown
of
care
with
a
tender
poor
boy
poor
boy
oh
how
needless
to
have
hoarded
up
such
a
wealth
of
love
she
could
lavish
it
in
profusion
yet
there
was
always
a
fresh
supply
away
with
the
the
haughty
aristocrat
she
stooped
to
him
played
the
little
girl
wanted
to
be
found
fault
with
and
scolded
looked
terrified
at
the
faintest
shadow
of
displeasure
on
his
face
and
tried
to
read
his
every
wish
wishes
he
himself
was
not
aware
of
from
his
eyes
she
wanted
to
be
grateful
for
his
goodness
his
tenderness
for
everything
he
had
done
to
save
her
from
ruin
no
wonder
then
that
by
degrees
he
lost
his
adoring
upward
glance
and
began
to
make
demands
sometimes
very
whimsical
demands
and
assume
the
manner
of
a
husband
now
and
then
he
even
recalled
his
benefactions
not
very
emphatically
though
with
sufficient
explicitness
to
change
what
was
at
first
voluntary
humility
into
a
duty
since
lilly
had
become
his
mistress
his
attitude
to
the
world
had
veered
about
so
that
his
entire
life
stood
on
a
different
basis
the
pedantic
bronze
manufacturer
so
dreadfully
concerned
for
his
good
name
and
standing
in
respectable
society
had
changed
into
a
daring
fast
liver
so
far
from
hesitating
to
be
seen
at
lilly
side
on
the
streets
and
promenades
he
could
not
display
himself
to
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
often
enough
the
good
old
brougham
no
longer
sufficed
he
must
also
have
a
spacious
victoria
in
which
to
drive
with
lilly
along
unter
den
linden
to
the
tiergarten
when
they
went
out
together
in
the
evening
he
chose
the
places
where
most
of
fashionable
berlin
is
to
be
found
and
tried
to
obtain
seats
from
which
they
could
be
observed
on
all
sides
he
sat
in
the
boxes
at
theatre
with
a
swelling
shirt
front
carefully
tailored
and
barbered
and
manicured
and
endeavoured
to
present
an
indifferent
blasé
smile
to
the
glasses
levelled
upon
him
and
his
companion
he
ordered
his
clothes
from
the
representatives
of
london
houses
that
bob
up
in
berlin
every
spring
and
autumn
in
search
of
customers
he
adopted
a
monocle
and
stuck
his
handkerchief
inside
his
left
cuff
the
military
officer
in
him
came
to
the
surface
and
endeavoured
to
ape
the
effeminate
gestures
of
the
fops
of
the
guard
in
short
he
bent
all
his
energies
upon
proving
himself
worthy
of
a
mistress
of
lilly
rank
and
qualities
he
soon
discovered
that
connection
with
so
exquisite
a
creature
so
far
from
damaging
him
cast
an
unhoped
for
glamour
about
his
life
even
about
his
business
lending
it
an
air
of
splendour
that
all
his
superb
remodelling
had
not
been
able
to
give
it
if
the
senior
member
of
the
firm
of
liebert
dehnicke
the
world
said
can
indulge
in
such
an
extravagance
his
goods
must
be
selling
much
better
than
we
thought
and
many
a
dealer
who
had
formerly
bought
of
his
competitors
now
came
to
him
impelled
by
those
mysterious
powers
of
suggestion
whose
laws
psychologists
and
historians
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
fathom
people
showed
him
greater
respect
but
a
respect
mitigated
by
that
jovial
confidential
smile
which
the
world
always
smiles
when
it
pardons
a
man
of
proven
harmlessness
an
interesting
secret
little
infirmity
questions
like
when
are
we
going
to
see
you
outside
of
business
or
what
do
you
say
to
making
a
night
of
it
together
now
and
then
questions
from
persons
who
had
paid
no
attention
to
him
formerly
became
as
cheap
as
the
bronze
wares
of
liebert
dehnicke
by
right
i
ought
to
charge
you
to
the
expense
account
of
the
business
he
once
said
with
a
smile
to
lilly
who
by
and
by
ceased
to
feel
pained
at
delicate
jokes
of
that
sort
the
evening
excursions
which
took
place
three
or
four
times
a
week
gradually
became
a
matter
of
habit
and
rapidly
acquainted
lilly
with
all
the
pleasures
that
float
from
the
witch
cauldron
of
berlin
life
it
was
now
too
late
in
the
winter
for
those
great
public
balls
at
which
one
shams
the
mysterious
lady
of
rank
beneath
a
silk
domino
to
compensate
there
were
the
theatres
where
observances
are
lax
and
the
lowest
vices
of
the
parisian
boulevards
diluted
and
warmed
over
are
dished
up
to
tickle
the
palates
of
hungry
cabarets
where
obscene
jests
are
clothed
in
literary
garb
and
wild
women
escaped
from
the
confines
of
life
vie
with
professional
singers
for
the
palm
of
vulgarity
bars
and
back
rooms
of
aristocratic
restaurants
which
the
law
forbids
to
be
locked
and
in
which
chilly
orgies
are
smiled
upon
mockingly
by
correct
waiters
and
to
wind
up
with
certain
cafés
sparkling
with
lights
and
blue
with
cigarette
smoke
where
the
weary
nerves
seek
and
find
their
final
stimulation
in
contact
with
prostitutes
selling
their
wares
in
open
market
in
the
beginning
lilly
opposed
these
doings
her
senses
demanded
satisfaction
of
another
sort
she
had
a
vague
feeling
of
mournfulness
as
if
each
day
of
this
new
life
were
carrying
her
farther
and
farther
from
those
stairs
to
which
her
longing
had
gone
out
but
when
she
saw
that
her
every
wish
for
quiet
encountered
sulky
resistance
she
gave
up
her
desires
voluntarily
and
kept
her
dreams
for
a
better
time
a
time
which
would
bring
all
her
hopes
to
fruition
which
which
her
fancy
might
venture
no
farther
besides
it
was
always
so
fascinating
so
dazzling
lilly
and
dehnicke
were
seldom
left
alone
in
proceeding
from
place
to
place
they
would
meet
acquaintances
many
of
whom
lilly
had
seen
at
the
carnival
and
they
would
join
company
informally
or
frequently
appointments
were
made
beforehand
so
there
was
quite
a
group
of
them
a
little
fixed
nucleus
about
which
newcomers
kept
crystallising
one
of
the
faithful
was
that
sweet
little
brunette
with
the
unsteady
glowing
eyes
and
the
foolish
smile
who
had
wanted
her
friend
and
herself
to
form
a
little
family
group
at
supper
with
lilly
and
dehnicke
her
name
was
sievekingk
a
vague
desire
for
life
had
caused
her
to
run
away
from
her
husband
a
physician
somewhere
in
further
pomerania
after
having
gone
through
various
experiences
she
was
now
living
with
the
proprietor
of
a
large
steam
laundry
a
swell
thin
as
a
broomstick
wohlfahrt
by
name
he
suffered
from
dyspepsia
and
sievekingk
always
had
ready
in
her
an
assortment
of
pills
and
powders
but
this
touching
energetic
care
of
him
did
not
prevent
her
from
deceiving
him
for
the
sake
of
any
man
who
courted
her
everybody
knew
it
and
nobody
blamed
her
she
was
a
poetess
and
had
to
create
experiences
to
sing
about
as
a
result
many
a
lover
who
thought
he
was
sinning
with
her
in
absolute
secrecy
would
a
few
weeks
later
discover
an
exact
portrait
of
himself
as
the
hero
of
a
passionate
sketch
or
a
murky
love
poem
in
some
magazine
of
the
latest
school
there
was
welter
also
the
divorced
wife
of
the
renowned
composer
whose
round
russet
face
she
had
returned
lately
from
a
mysterious
pleasure
trip
to
algeria
formed
a
droll
contrast
to
the
golden
aureole
of
her
mass
of
dyed
hair
it
was
dangerous
to
associate
with
her
she
borrowed
of
everybody
she
met
although
she
was
in
comfortable
circumstances
receiving
an
ample
alimony
from
her
former
husband
rich
relatives
her
constant
state
of
want
was
due
to
her
infinite
goodness
which
led
her
to
turn
over
all
she
possessed
and
all
her
friends
gave
her
to
two
cashiered
lovers
each
of
whom
in
his
way
was
a
scamp
nobody
knew
to
whom
she
was
attached
at
present
she
was
frequently
seen
with
a
district
attorney
who
was
stiff
as
a
poker
and
too
formal
to
use
a
toothpick
on
his
hollow
teeth
and
so
sat
for
hours
in
silence
busily
rolling
his
tongue
between
his
jaws
among
others
was
an
extremely
thin
little
shrewmouse
dainty
and
devilish
with
steely
eyes
and
thin
pinched
lips
turning
inward
she
always
wore
white
silk
and
dragged
a
rustling
train
she
called
herself
karla
nobody
knew
her
real
name
except
her
lover
a
mere
boy
the
son
of
a
manufacturer
pale
puny
and
completely
in
her
toils
he
followed
her
about
until
dawn
indulging
her
in
her
sapping
lust
for
pleasure
in
an
unguarded
moment
he
revealed
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
jewish
scholar
who
lived
in
absolute
seclusion
and
actually
believed
that
she
was
occupied
in
satisfying
the
social
demands
of
the
berlin
west
side
and
while
she
wantoned
with
all
sorts
of
people
in
music
halls
and
her
husband
sat
quietly
at
home
poring
over
his
statistical
tables
there
were
women
of
every
description
for
whose
past
and
whose
means
of
subsistence
no
one
concerned
himself
provided
they
were
pretty
and
elegant
and
not
exactly
in
addition
to
the
ladies
legitimate
escorts
were
a
large
number
of
gentlemen
who
came
every
evening
to
fish
in
troubled
waters
these
gentlemen
constituted
the
real
enlivening
element
and
among
them
was
the
salmoni
who
had
wielded
the
big
stick
at
carnival
while
smiling
a
mournful
smile
in
his
company
lilly
felt
she
always
grew
embarrassed
and
reticent
although
it
seemed
to
her
a
secret
bond
united
them
as
at
the
carnival
he
exercised
his
caustic
wit
upon
every
person
who
crossed
his
path
with
the
exception
of
herself
whom
he
passed
by
considerately
now
and
then
he
dissected
her
with
his
probing
eyes
and
two
or
three
times
he
whispered
softly
what
are
you
seeking
to
find
here
lovely
lady
kellermann
too
presented
himself
not
infrequently
grew
befuddled
and
then
threw
out
remarks
about
a
chained
beauty
crying
to
be
set
free
remarks
which
lilly
assiduously
endeavoured
not
to
hear
at
the
end
of
the
evening
he
usually
discovered
he
was
out
of
pocket
upon
which
richard
came
to
his
rescue
such
was
the
world
in
which
from
now
on
lilly
days
and
nights
glided
along
she
received
mysterious
messages
of
all
sorts
invitations
from
strange
gentlemen
to
discreet
rendezvous
flowers
sent
anonymously
from
modest
bouquets
of
violets
to
gorgeous
baskets
of
orchids
visits
from
ladies
of
suspicious
character
who
were
organising
private
charity
circles
and
with
highly
significant
smiles
asked
lilly
to
join
a
turbid
surf
of
desire
forever
rolling
up
to
her
threshold
at
first
it
frightened
her
finally
she
took
no
notice
of
it
spring
came
and
with
it
the
races
at
which
everybody
appears
who
lays
claim
for
any
reason
at
all
to
membership
in
the
world
of
elegance
since
lilly
had
been
enthroned
at
richard
side
the
slumbering
cavalry
officer
in
him
had
been
awakened
to
such
lively
consciousness
his
passion
for
native
had
swelled
to
such
vast
proportions
that
he
would
not
have
dreamed
of
missing
a
single
race
although
he
never
betted
his
pockets
were
stuffed
with
crumpled
tips
chances
and
pedigrees
constituted
his
sole
topic
of
conversation
and
lilly
who
took
not
the
least
interest
in
it
all
willingly
lent
him
her
undivided
attention
one
morning
on
studying
the
account
of
the
previous
day
race
in
her
paper
the
following
passage
attracted
her
notice
among
the
charming
representatives
of
the
world
which
knows
no
was
the
impressive
beauty
who
for
some
time
past
has
permitted
glimpses
of
herself
everywhere
and
who
still
radiates
the
discreet
atmosphere
of
the
which
it
is
rumoured
was
once
her
native
element
she
favors
violet
and
in
accordance
with
a
famous
precedent
she
might
be
dubbed
dame
aux
we
congratulate
ourselves
upon
the
appearance
of
this
new
star
who
will
only
add
to
the
reputation
of
our
metropolitan
life
who
can
that
be
thought
lilly
slightly
envious
and
passed
in
review
the
beautiful
women
she
had
admired
the
day
before
then
suddenly
the
blood
rushed
to
her
head
her
glance
sought
the
redfern
costume
which
she
had
not
yet
hung
away
and
was
lying
across
the
back
of
a
chair
it
was
two
years
old
but
so
wonderfully
well
made
that
it
could
compete
with
the
new
creations
of
the
spring
since
this
was
the
only
suit
of
the
sort
she
possessed
richard
must
be
spared
unnecessary
expense
she
had
worn
it
several
times
in
succession
yes
she
no
longer
doubted
the
item
referred
to
her
and
no
other
her
first
thought
was
how
pleased
richard
will
be
she
too
was
pleased
laue
boldest
prophecies
seemed
about
to
be
fulfilled
she
was
growing
famous
she
actually
figured
in
the
papers
but
that
feeling
of
dread
that
enigmatic
senseless
dread
which
forever
crouched
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
crept
to
the
surface
at
the
very
moment
a
new
event
led
her
on
a
stage
further
toward
grandeur
and
happiness
since
she
had
stepped
into
the
world
at
richard
side
she
had
encountered
nothing
but
what
awakened
gladness
pride
and
hope
everybody
respected
and
flattered
her
scorn
of
herself
thoughts
had
passed
away
giving
place
to
a
quiet
appreciation
of
her
own
value
in
the
presence
of
strangers
but
that
stupid
dull
dread
never
left
her
it
would
not
be
silenced
earlier
in
the
afternoon
than
usual
richard
came
down
the
street
beaming
and
openly
waving
the
paper
up
to
her
after
they
had
embraced
ten
times
and
read
the
passage
in
the
paper
twice
as
often
richard
turned
taciturn
and
gloomy
folded
his
arms
like
napoleon
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
with
short
sharp
steps
you
could
see
ambition
seething
in
his
brain
the
bell
rang
little
sievekingk
was
announced
she
had
come
for
a
friendly
little
talk
with
lilly
several
times
before
though
the
two
had
not
grown
more
intimate
as
a
result
this
time
she
arrived
opportunely
to
help
them
taste
the
joy
of
lilly
fame
her
grey
velvet
suit
shimmered
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
and
the
red
turban
with
the
waving
aigrette
nestled
in
her
dark
curly
head
like
a
tongue
of
flame
darting
downward
she
held
her
hand
out
to
lilly
with
her
seductive
smile
but
when
she
turned
to
richard
her
eyes
flashed
with
some
of
the
energy
with
which
she
insisted
upon
her
lover
taking
a
dose
in
the
presence
of
strangers
lilly
and
richard
still
kept
up
the
myth
of
a
platonic
friendship
so
richard
modestly
reached
for
his
hat
to
extract
from
lilly
the
polite
request
that
he
stay
a
little
longer
but
the
small
dark
woman
anticipated
them
do
be
foolish
she
said
do
behave
as
if
you
were
perfectly
at
home
here
you
may
call
each
other
by
your
first
names
as
if
from
a
slip
of
the
tongue
and
i
pretend
not
to
have
heard
a
thing
lilly
and
richard
smiled
and
while
lilly
poured
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
guest
richard
played
with
the
paper
he
wanted
to
make
certain
whether
sievekingk
had
learned
of
the
great
triumph
what
i
really
came
for
was
on
account
of
that
stuff
she
said
and
you
are
the
very
person
i
want
to
speak
to
about
it
i
suppose
awfully
proud
of
it
richard
made
a
deprecating
gesture
and
smiled
complacently
to
be
quite
frank
i
credited
you
with
a
grain
or
two
more
sense
i
beg
pardon
richard
observed
taken
aback
lilly
started
her
dread
of
the
morning
grew
into
the
suspicion
that
her
great
fortune
had
a
cloven
hoof
just
let
me
speak
said
the
little
woman
her
eyes
now
flashing
very
steadily
with
a
conscious
purpose
i
have
experience
in
such
matters
my
began
the
same
way
with
me
has
the
thought
never
occurred
to
you
dehnicke
that
when
a
choice
creature
like
this
one
sitting
here
something
so
sweet
and
glorious
that
you
never
find
her
like
entrusts
herself
to
you
you
have
assumed
a
vast
responsibility
do
you
think
we
here
to
puff
and
swell
your
vanity
we
not
factory
girls
or
ballet
dancers
to
be
stuck
into
silks
and
laces
and
led
around
to
show
the
world
that
you
a
fine
buck
we
have
fallen
from
society
i
know
but
we
not
to
be
classed
not
by
a
long
shot
with
those
women
to
whose
ranks
you
would
like
to
reduce
us
richard
wanted
to
reply
but
could
not
find
the
right
words
and
sievekingk
continued
bending
toward
lilly
tenderly
so
here
comes
a
poor
little
mite
in
its
unsuspecting
aristocracy
and
says
me
do
with
me
what
you
want
and
what
will
you
do
with
her
you
make
a
fast
woman
of
her
at
least
what
the
world
takes
to
be
a
fast
woman
do
contradict
me
as
a
beginning
you
already
done
very
well
she
pointed
to
the
paper
once
the
yellow
journals
take
us
up
then
the
counts
of
the
guard
are
on
the
spot
and
then
may
the
lord
have
mercy
on
us
they
much
and
more
chivalrous
than
you
and
if
we
become
we
like
at
least
to
know
for
whom
and
for
what
and
if
you
affect
indifference
then
you
nothing
in
our
opinion
but
a
bad
joke
of
yesterday
lilly
breath
was
taken
away
she
had
not
thought
it
possible
that
anyone
should
dare
to
speak
to
richard
in
such
a
tone
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
deprecatingly
to
pacify
him
she
feared
he
might
become
angry
and
enforce
his
rights
as
master
of
the
place
the
very
contrary
occurred
i
will
gladly
do
what
you
say
he
replied
if
only
i
knew
i
tell
you
what
you
do
know
you
must
lead
her
around
like
an
animal
in
a
show
do
expose
her
to
the
gaze
of
all
sorts
of
people
do
seat
her
in
the
front
of
the
box
at
opera
for
every
rake
to
stare
at
richard
plucked
up
his
spirits
for
a
defence
are
to
be
seen
everywhere
certainly
because
i
myself
want
to
see
things
that
the
reason
i
ran
away
from
my
horror
of
a
husband
nevertheless
i
do
take
box
seats
and
i
do
fly
around
race
tracks
either
i
by
nature
a
bohemian
while
lilly
with
her
quiet
refined
heart
is
a
bourgeois
and
a
bourgeois
she
ought
to
remain
as
if
she
were
your
wife
by
law
but
neither
of
us
wants
to
descend
to
the
i
mean
what
we
mean
by
in
germany
in
the
french
sense
we
been
in
it
a
long
time
that
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
my
dear
sir
richard
arose
helplessly
quite
red
in
the
face
gnawing
ferociously
at
his
moustache
i
always
had
nothing
but
her
good
at
heart
he
said
beside
it
was
your
wish
too
was
it
lilly
lilly
could
not
make
denial
she
did
not
want
to
shame
him
any
further
and
she
turned
aside
without
replying
and
supposing
it
was
her
wish
a
thousand
times
the
little
woman
rejoined
in
lilly
stead
you
should
have
said
to
her
dear
you
do
understand
since
we
are
not
married
that
would
be
the
best
for
both
of
you
must
live
modestly
otherwise
i
should
do
you
mortal
injury
i
should
throw
you
in
the
mire
lilly
felt
tears
rising
to
her
eyes
as
always
when
the
subject
of
marriage
in
connection
with
richard
and
herself
arose
not
to
show
her
emotion
she
quickly
left
the
room
to
fetch
richard
overcoat
it
was
already
quarter
of
six
she
accompanied
him
to
the
door
and
kissed
him
tenderly
he
must
by
no
means
suppose
that
he
had
jarred
her
or
that
she
bore
him
a
grudge
when
she
returned
to
her
guest
she
took
his
part
eagerly
he
was
very
dear
and
good
he
had
saved
her
from
ruin
and
certainly
meditated
no
evil
i
not
here
to
sow
dissension
said
the
little
woman
laughing
she
then
asked
to
be
allowed
to
remain
a
little
longer
my
first
name
is
jula
and
please
avail
yourself
of
it
in
the
future
they
sat
hand
in
hand
on
the
straight
sofa
over
which
masterful
smile
had
been
replaced
by
an
extremely
indifferent
scene
on
the
glass
plate
in
front
of
each
was
a
bit
of
nibbled
cake
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
lilly
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
possessing
something
like
a
friend
she
had
always
felt
uneasy
in
miss
von
schwertfeger
presence
the
canary
bird
sang
a
sorry
spring
song
and
the
sparrows
outside
in
the
chestnut
trees
responded
the
may
sun
painted
red
spirals
on
the
wall
and
from
time
to
time
a
greenish
golden
flash
darted
from
the
aquarium
when
one
of
the
little
fish
shot
through
the
waving
algæ
the
hour
of
confidences
had
struck
i
put
on
mighty
superior
airs
just
then
said
jula
but
it
was
necessary
to
my
dear
because
you
just
like
me
you
are
standing
on
the
very
edge
one
touch
and
over
we
go
where
no
one
will
pick
us
up
if
we
could
rely
on
our
own
character
our
plight
would
not
be
so
bad
but
there
are
no
two
ways
about
it
we
ca
always
be
faithful
we
do
want
to
be
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
cried
lilly
jula
ran
her
little
red
tongue
along
her
lips
just
wait
my
dear
the
men
we
meet
are
really
not
calculated
to
make
us
see
that
we
are
here
for
one
alone
in
fact
the
only
way
to
enjoy
them
is
in
the
plural
oh
i
could
tell
you
things
but
i
do
want
to
alarm
you
besides
there
a
danger
attached
to
the
plural
each
man
we
give
ourselves
up
to
robs
us
of
a
piece
of
what
is
best
in
us
what
is
best
i
tell
you
even
if
we
ca
clearly
define
it
it
consciousness
of
our
own
worth
because
if
possible
that
survives
it
not
purity
either
we
do
give
a
fig
for
purity
happiness
certainly
not
we
should
die
of
dulness
if
we
stuck
to
one
man
spoken
to
a
number
of
women
and
they
all
have
the
same
feeling
some
of
them
think
it
better
not
to
fall
in
love
and
do
it
just
from
caprice
some
swear
by
the
grand
passion
which
is
to
consecrate
everything
no
two
persons
i
suppose
think
alike
in
this
respect
and
now
i
want
to
give
you
a
little
advice
because
your
turn
will
come
some
day
accept
any
gifts
at
least
no
gifts
of
money
value
at
the
utmost
flowers
and
none
too
many
of
them
and
do
give
gifts
in
return
because
everything
belongs
to
married
women
may
but
it
not
seemly
for
us
in
general
avoid
the
de
because
is
characteristic
of
prostitutes
married
women
may
do
all
that
because
they
have
to
take
revenge
for
being
tied
to
the
we
on
the
contrary
are
free
we
are
permitted
to
go
whenever
we
want
to
but
we
must
anything
but
not
that
why
must
we
asked
lilly
who
suddenly
began
to
feel
her
chains
married
women
may
they
everything
they
may
be
divorced
as
often
as
they
want
and
carry
their
heads
just
as
high
as
before
as
for
us
each
time
we
thrust
lower
into
the
world
of
prostitutes
and
the
oftener
we
change
the
more
we
become
free
booty
all
very
well
if
we
have
money
of
our
own
but
neither
you
nor
i
have
they
hover
over
us
like
vultures
ready
to
swoop
down
upon
us
if
she
allowed
herself
to
be
supported
by
him
and
and
why
is
she
to
be
had
for
good
money
too
that
the
reason
we
must
hold
fast
to
the
one
we
have
no
matter
how
small
and
horrid
he
is
no
matter
how
repulsive
we
think
him
i
do
understand
said
lilly
if
you
with
a
man
you
love
him
oh
do
you
mean
to
say
you
loved
every
man
you
were
with
why
there
were
so
many
replied
lilly
beside
my
husband
the
general
she
could
not
deny
herself
the
joy
of
uttering
that
proud
word
there
was
only
one
other
and
now
here
oh
stuff
cried
jula
in
righteous
indignation
do
you
want
to
blossom
in
my
eyes
as
a
rose
of
virtue
lilly
protested
she
was
speaking
the
truth
jula
could
not
credit
it
why
then
you
not
one
of
us
you
ought
really
be
a
judge
wife
lilly
laughed
she
who
had
always
thought
sentence
had
long
before
been
pronounced
upon
her
immoral
conduct
now
heard
herself
ridiculed
for
her
excess
of
virtue
oh
if
i
were
to
tell
you
the
stories
of
all
the
women
we
meet
continued
jula
one
of
them
goes
with
girls
in
secret
one
rents
out
rooms
to
students
but
only
to
students
she
likes
and
then
one
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
who
fetches
her
lovers
in
from
the
street
lilly
shuddered
what
i
sat
next
to
a
woman
like
that
and
never
suspected
it
jula
eyes
glowed
into
space
it
dreadful
is
it
she
said
and
laughed
well
it
bother
me
i
have
my
poems
they
lend
sanctity
to
my
acts
and
wash
me
clean
again
it
for
their
sake
i
do
it
all
i
need
sensations
yes
i
need
sensations
i
must
feel
my
blood
chase
through
my
veins
i
must
study
study
something
new
in
each
one
no
matter
how
inane
a
man
may
be
so
inane
that
a
thimble
would
hold
his
soul
nevertheless
he
has
one
hour
of
intoxication
to
give
you
one
hour
in
which
all
the
bells
chime
and
even
the
spheres
make
their
heavenly
music
and
the
more
men
you
possess
the
more
life
you
possess
the
more
souls
you
creep
into
all
the
doors
of
life
fly
open
all
the
secrets
are
revealed
if
you
can
hear
the
pulsebeat
of
a
stranger
can
feel
it
under
your
fingers
yours
he
you
yourself
then
you
live
one
life
more
yes
that
life
that
what
i
call
life
lilly
said
to
herself
she
could
not
possibly
take
this
talk
seriously
though
hot
and
cold
waves
shivered
through
her
body
i
do
understand
what
you
say
she
replied
and
rose
jula
did
not
even
hear
her
a
mystic
fire
smouldered
in
her
eyes
she
looked
like
a
priestess
sacrificing
to
dark
gods
it
struck
eight
the
maid
had
set
the
table
in
the
and
had
laid
a
cover
for
the
strange
lady
who
did
not
seem
disposed
to
leave
she
now
came
to
announce
that
the
meal
was
served
will
you
stay
and
dine
with
me
asked
lilly
somewhat
against
her
will
at
last
jula
woke
up
she
neither
accepted
nor
declined
but
arose
and
disengaged
her
flaming
hat
from
her
dark
curls
i
crazy
am
i
not
she
said
and
the
foolish
seductive
smile
blossomed
about
her
lips
again
drawing
a
breath
of
relief
lilly
opened
the
door
to
the
the
table
gleamed
with
snowy
damask
strewn
with
leaves
of
light
formed
by
the
pierced
shade
of
the
hanging
lamp
the
gaily
coloured
dishes
which
lilly
had
bought
cheap
at
a
sale
were
a
copy
of
an
old
strasburg
pattern
the
knives
and
forks
as
well
as
the
set
of
casters
and
the
sugar
tongs
were
of
the
finest
plate
to
be
distinguished
from
real
silver
only
by
the
mark
when
richard
stayed
for
the
evening
meal
he
should
find
everything
as
shining
and
substantial
as
at
his
mother
jula
burst
into
raptures
oh
how
beautiful
your
place
is
how
dear
how
charming
am
i
not
right
in
saying
you
were
born
to
be
a
married
woman
you
ought
to
see
my
rubbish
at
home
what
the
use
if
my
has
spoiled
his
stomach
in
a
restaurant
on
larded
lamb
kidneys
or
turkey
the
next
day
i
have
to
prepare
gruel
and
toast
and
i
serve
it
to
him
directly
from
the
pot
what
the
use
of
making
a
lot
of
fuss
and
setting
a
table
thank
the
lord
thought
lilly
she
herself
again
the
meal
was
modest
enough
various
cold
cuts
with
roasted
potatoes
and
the
remnants
of
a
pastry
for
dessert
but
jula
ate
as
if
such
delights
had
not
been
spread
before
her
for
years
and
she
had
to
know
exactly
where
lilly
got
her
supplies
lilly
informed
her
accurately
for
the
sake
of
cheapness
she
said
she
got
her
cold
meats
from
a
man
in
the
country
whose
address
she
would
be
glad
to
give
jula
i
divined
it
immediately
said
jula
softly
her
eyes
staring
meditatively
after
a
pause
she
added
more
softly
that
just
the
way
it
was
there
there
where
asked
lilly
why
in
my
home
suddenly
jula
threw
her
napkin
on
the
table
jumped
from
her
seat
and
stepped
to
the
open
window
wringing
her
hands
and
pressing
them
to
her
forehead
i
going
to
ruin
i
going
to
ruin
i
going
to
ruin
she
moaned
out
into
the
night
what
the
matter
faltered
lilly
in
fright
and
also
jumped
up
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
husband
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
husband
a
cross
old
piece
i
know
and
it
death
to
live
with
him
it
true
it
true
but
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
him
i
going
to
ruin
here
going
to
ruin
here
lilly
stepped
behind
her
and
stroked
her
neck
why
should
you
go
to
ruin
here
she
comforted
her
you
just
now
gave
me
such
splendid
advice
about
how
to
keep
from
going
to
ruin
besides
you
have
a
mainstay
in
your
art
which
i
lost
long
ago
she
looked
with
a
sigh
at
the
sample
closets
in
which
the
last
of
her
woods
reposed
unseen
no
you
wo
go
to
ruin
you
will
reach
the
heights
from
which
you
will
look
down
on
us
poor
women
jula
sobbed
on
her
shoulder
never
again
never
again
she
wailed
i
ca
pull
myself
out
of
this
whirlpool
it
as
if
i
were
poisoned
my
brain
is
poisoned
i
going
to
ruin
i
going
to
ruin
lilly
clasped
her
gently
under
the
arm
and
led
her
back
to
the
unlighted
and
seated
her
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
where
she
had
sat
before
it
nice
and
dark
here
jula
said
whimpering
like
a
child
so
i
going
to
confess
everything
everything
but
close
the
door
there
must
be
a
ray
of
light
lilly
closed
the
door
of
the
they
now
sat
in
darkness
the
evening
dusk
reflected
from
the
canal
through
the
chestnut
trees
still
thinly
leaved
poured
a
vapoury
grey
over
the
face
before
began
jula
i
told
you
of
a
woman
who
seeks
her
adventures
on
the
street
and
you
jumped
up
in
horror
do
you
know
who
that
woman
is
am
that
woman
for
god
sake
cried
lilly
yes
i
am
that
woman
the
evenings
my
leaves
me
alone
i
put
on
dark
clothes
and
go
to
parts
where
no
one
who
knows
me
is
likely
to
meet
me
if
somebody
i
come
across
pleases
me
i
give
him
a
look
as
a
rule
he
turns
back
and
speaks
to
me
and
i
go
with
him
to
common
saloons
or
to
a
little
confectionery
shop
anywhere
he
wants
to
or
i
sit
with
him
on
a
bench
in
the
dark
and
if
he
pleases
me
still
more
i
go
with
him
wherever
else
he
wants
to
oh
how
terrible
cried
lilly
pressing
her
hands
to
her
eyes
now
she
knew
why
a
few
months
before
something
had
been
pulling
her
to
the
street
all
the
time
all
the
time
why
a
delicious
shiver
had
coursed
through
her
body
when
a
man
spoke
to
her
in
the
dark
she
had
simply
been
too
fearsome
to
answer
him
now
that
you
know
what
i
am
you
wo
want
me
to
stay
sitting
here
on
your
sofa
cried
jula
be
perfectly
frank
i
ready
to
go
she
reached
out
pleadingly
for
lilly
hands
lilly
seemed
to
herself
like
a
good
samaritan
who
has
met
one
who
is
grievously
ill
and
must
render
that
assistance
which
the
moment
requires
but
why
do
you
do
it
she
asked
gently
you
are
not
so
lonely
how
did
it
come
about
yes
how
did
it
come
about
do
you
know
how
life
turned
out
as
it
did
it
all
very
well
and
good
for
people
to
reproach
us
with
weakness
one
necessity
always
holds
out
its
hand
to
another
each
wish
gives
birth
to
another
and
you
always
think
you
doing
what
is
right
and
what
fate
has
prescribed
that
true
faltered
lilly
recalling
the
decisive
moments
of
her
own
life
this
is
what
i
always
said
to
myself
my
poetry
requires
it
i
must
have
experiences
pictures
that
as
the
french
say
but
all
that
a
mere
pretext
the
truth
is
we
hunt
and
hunt
and
hunt
your
husband
not
the
right
one
your
not
the
right
man
and
none
of
the
rest
of
them
your
sporting
business
man
or
your
but
he
must
be
the
stranger
sitting
at
the
next
table
he
the
one
surely
so
you
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
after
all
he
the
right
one
it
is
most
certainly
not
the
fine
ones
because
they
take
the
trouble
to
possess
us
without
taking
the
trouble
to
find
out
whether
there
anything
fine
in
us
too
so
you
keep
on
hunting
perhaps
you
will
meet
him
on
the
street
finally
it
turns
into
fever
which
wholly
consumes
you
sometimes
i
can
scarcely
fall
asleep
in
anticipation
of
the
next
dark
evening
when
i
shall
rove
about
again
now
do
you
see
i
must
be
going
to
my
ruin
when
i
saw
your
beautifully
set
table
all
of
a
sudden
a
longing
for
my
home
and
my
husband
came
over
me
again
yes
i
sometimes
have
that
longing
he
has
bleared
eyes
and
he
smells
of
carbolic
acid
oh
that
vile
smell
like
so
to
smell
it
again

even
throw
the
stethoscope
at
me

besides
he
wrote
to
me

should
return
to
him

i
want

will
remain
here
and
go
to
my
ruin
life
funny
she
rose
and
groped
for
her
hat
and
hatpins
lying
on
the
table
lilly
did
not
want
to
let
her
go
in
such
a
state
of
mind
if
you
feel
it
is
driving
you
to
your
ruin
that
it
a
poison
in
your
blood
why
do
you
try
to
resist
why
do
you
pluck
it
out
of
your
system
mere
force
of
will
must
help
some
i
said
that
to
myself
rejoined
jula
but
i
never
had
anyone
to
whom
i
could
speak
about
it
and
who
could
help
me
now
found
you
it
will
be
easier
for
me
now
i
feel
i
might
be
able
to
maybe
i
will
do
you
want
to
give
me
your
promise
asked
lilly
holding
out
her
hand
to
her
yes
i
promise
jula
cried
and
delightedly
clapped
her
hand
in
lilly
you
will
be
my
saviour
you
are
already
i
feel
it
to
show
my
thanks

will
stand
guard
over
you

no
one
spoils
you

be
what
i
am
or
the
others
oh
i
take
care
of
myself
faltered
lilly
yes
that
what
you
say
but
when
the
dreary
void
comes
and
grows
more
and
more
insipid
just
you
see
you
nothing
left
to
say
to
yourself
and
you
must
have
children
for
god
sake
we
have
them
all
of
us
know
how
to
prevent
them
from
coming
you
share
his
activities
with
him
either
he
acquaints
you
with
as
many
of
them
as
he
is
compelled
to
and
behind
it
all
you
feel
the
hostility
of
his
family
who
look
upon
you
as
a
species
of
harpy
then
those
cursed
schemes
of
his
for
marrying
that
he
dishes
up
whenever
he
angry
above
all
the
longing
it
like
a
steady
toothache
that
it
like
the
toothache
you
do
want
to
think
of
it
but
wherever
you
go
it
tortures
you
for
life
end
that
way
something
happen
it
much
worse
than
if
you
married
just
you
wait
and
see
jula
wild
words
increased
the
pain
at
lilly
heart
a
desolate
mournfulness
threatened
to
attack
her
stop
she
said
if
it
must
come
it
will
come
soon
enough
i
care
to
think
of
it
beforehand
right
you
are
my
dear
it
does
help
any
either
jula
now
took
leave
will
you
remember
your
promise
asked
lilly
from
the
hall
door
forever
and
ever
i
swear
to
you
and
jula
slipped
down
the
stairs
with
her
brain
in
a
whirl
lilly
returned
to
her
dark
sad
and
distraught
and
leaned
her
head
out
of
the
open
window
for
a
whiff
of
fresh
air
she
saw
the
little
woman
who
had
just
emerged
from
the
front
entrance
lightly
and
gracefully
trip
along
the
pavement
a
gentleman
in
a
and
patent
leather
shoes
came
towards
her
passed
her
started
stopped
abruptly
turned
about
and
when
he
reached
her
side
raised
his
hat
with
exaggerated
politeness
in
the
light
of
the
lilly
saw
her
face
smiling
up
at
him
curiously
insinuatingly
and
then
they
went
on
their
way
together
chapter
ix
richard
reluctantly
adapted
himself
to
a
less
showy
existence
he
still
wanted
to
parade
his
possession
of
lilly
but
little
jula
homily
had
sunk
deep
into
his
conscience
and
he
did
not
dare
to
disobey
her
nevertheless
he
was
bored
and
vexed
and
sulky
and
lilly
was
on
the
point
of
herself
suggesting
that
they
go
to
the
races
when
she
received
news
of
her
mother
death
she
shed
the
number
of
tears
and
suffered
the
amount
of
affliction
befitting
her
tender
heart
in
reality
her
mother
had
been
dead
to
her
so
long
before
that
her
grief
could
not
be
very
profound
before
leaving
berlin
to
attend
the
burial
at
the
insane
asylum
her
greatest
concern
was
to
have
as
simple
a
mourning
dress
made
as
possible
she
felt
ashamed
that
she
had
provided
so
poorly
for
her
sick
mother
during
her
lifetime
and
she
wished
to
avoid
giving
offence
by
elegance
of
appearance
which
did
not
prevent
the
officials
and
physicians
of
the
institution
from
dancing
attendance
on
her
and
treating
her
as
if
she
were
a
sort
of
shining
black
bird
of
paradise
she
spent
three
glowing
spring
evenings
at
the
little
heap
of
earth
in
prayer
and
meditation
and
returned
to
berlin
in
a
serious
frame
of
mind
with
thoughts
stirred
up
like
soil
freshly
turned
by
the
plough
when
at
her
mother
grave
she
felt
she
hated
richard
but
when
she
found
him
awaiting
her
at
the
station
she
sank
into
his
arms
helplessly
eager
for
consolation
now
he
really
was
her
all
for
the
next
few
months
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
her
mourning
stood
in
the
way
of
pleasure
seeking
richard
it
must
be
said
to
his
credit
behaved
sweetly
and
considerately
he
sat
at
home
with
her
many
a
night
read
unintelligible
books
played
backgammon
and
preferred
falling
asleep
on
the
sofa
to
luring
her
into
the
world
of
gaiety
but
since
it
was
not
right
that
he
should
become
entirely
estranged
from
society
it
was
arranged
that
he
was
to
have
every
other
evening
for
himself
his
beautiful
mistress
reputation
had
smoothed
his
path
relying
upon
the
support
of
two
of
her
admirers
he
ventured
to
apply
for
admission
into
one
of
the
aristocratic
clubs
which
welcomed
him
without
a
single
black
ball
from
now
on
he
could
enjoy
the
supreme
delight
of
losing
his
firm
money
to
young
scions
of
the
aristocracy
foreign
attachés
and
other
superior
beings
lilly
disliked
hearing
of
his
losses
she
worried
over
his
annoyance
which
he
invariably
revealed
whenever
he
told
of
his
bad
luck
she
felt
constrained
and
then
offered
to
make
up
by
saving
even
more
than
she
had
heretofore
though
he
laughed
each
time
and
assured
her
that
what
she
cost
him
signified
as
little
as
if
he
were
to
indulge
in
one
additional
cigarette
a
day
she
clung
to
her
conviction
that
she
was
a
parasite
and
was
partly
responsible
for
the
welfare
of
liebert
dehnicke
when
he
spent
a
quiet
evening
with
her
resting
from
his
nocturnal
campaigns
they
always
talked
business
lilly
displayed
a
sharp
sense
for
practical
matters
even
for
accounts
and
her
artistic
judgment
was
sure
richard
very
often
brought
home
drawings
of
models
and
the
two
sat
bent
over
the
outspread
rolls
planning
and
consulting
with
each
other
like
partners
those
were
blessed
hours
lilly
never
wearied
of
inquiring
about
the
factory
how
many
people
were
employed
there
at
that
particular
time
whether
this
or
that
man
or
woman
was
still
working
for
him
she
did
not
know
the
names
but
designated
the
people
by
an
accurate
description
of
their
appearance
what
pieces
were
in
process
of
making
and
whether
the
supply
of
articles
of
one
or
other
model
had
not
yet
given
out
so
thoroughly
informed
she
kept
herself
as
to
the
firm
sales
the
factory
as
she
often
jestingly
remarked
to
richard
was
her
unhappy
love
to
call
for
him
at
his
office
at
closing
time
was
her
greatest
delight
and
had
she
been
permitted
to
she
would
have
busied
herself
at
the
factory
every
day
but
he
objected
his
employés
knew
of
the
close
relationship
between
them
and
he
must
avoid
gossip
and
ridicule
lilly
felt
sure
this
was
not
the
only
motive
she
had
long
fully
realised
that
his
mother
was
not
kindly
disposed
to
her
though
at
first
he
had
spoken
of
her
quite
freely
he
now
evaded
a
reply
when
lilly
directly
asked
for
her
probably
he
feared
exciting
the
old
indignation
if
he
permitted
his
mistress
to
make
herself
at
home
in
his
office
so
lilly
contented
herself
with
sympathetic
interest
from
afar
in
the
welfare
of
the
little
kingdom
on
the
evenings
she
was
left
alone
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
herself
she
got
into
the
habit
of
visiting
the
house
in
alte
jakobstrasse
she
left
a
little
before
ten
and
took
up
her
station
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
from
where
she
gazed
reverentially
at
the
old
grey
structure
she
admired
the
imitation
marble
columns
which
formed
a
decorative
frame
about
the
entrance
after
the
fashion
of
a
renaissance
gateway
she
stared
up
at
the
dimly
lighted
second
story
where
his
mother
dwelt
and
pressed
timidly
into
the
darkness
of
a
doorway
if
she
saw
the
threatening
shadow
of
a
woman
figure
glide
across
the
curtains
when
it
grew
late
and
the
tenants
of
the
house
ceased
to
come
and
go
she
ventured
to
cross
the
street
mount
the
three
steps
press
her
face
against
the
iron
grating
and
peep
into
the
hall
the
sheen
of
the
leafy
pyramid
the
subdued
milky
whiteness
of
the
clytie
bust
the
dark
glow
of
the
stained
glass
window
mingled
to
produce
the
mysterious
alluring
impression
of
a
dusky
chapel
the
steps
became
like
a
goal
of
a
pilgrimage
up
to
which
penitents
crawl
on
their
knees
the
stained
glass
window
became
a
heavenly
aureole
the
clytie
bust
a
benedictory
saint
late
in
the
summer
richard
was
called
to
the
manoeuvres
his
letters
were
curt
and
reserved
and
unsuccessfully
concealed
his
ill
humour
finally
they
were
dated
from
the
hospital
he
had
fallen
from
his
horse
and
his
left
knee
joint
was
inflamed
he
would
be
unable
to
ride
for
a
long
time
perhaps
forever
he
returned
in
october
wearing
a
gutta
percha
knee
cap
and
promptly
sent
in
his
resignation
from
the
regiment
the
fall
from
his
horse
in
truth
was
a
fortunate
incident
rumours
of
his
relation
with
the
divorced
wife
of
its
former
commander
had
reached
the
regiment
the
comrades
noticeably
held
aloof
from
him
and
evidently
his
chiefs
were
merely
awaiting
confirmation
of
the
report
to
call
him
to
account
officially
a
procedure
which
in
the
circumstances
would
have
brought
his
lieutenancy
in
the
reserves
to
a
catastrophal
end
the
accident
was
his
salvation
and
his
object
in
adopting
an
irritated
reproachful
manner
in
lilly
presence
was
merely
to
make
her
aware
of
what
he
was
sacrificing
because
of
his
love
of
her
indirectly
he
had
heard
news
of
the
colonel
which
filled
lilly
with
horror
it
had
gradually
become
a
fixed
idea
of
the
colonel
that
anna
von
schwertfeger
had
acted
in
collusion
with
lilly
and
von
prell
and
man
of
violence
that
he
was
he
had
chased
her
from
his
castle
since
then
he
lived
alone
a
maddened
misanthrope
and
it
was
feared
he
would
come
to
a
sad
end
an
ominous
greeting
from
those
sunny
days
of
lilly
past
a
few
months
later
that
occurred
which
jula
had
prophesied
one
day
richard
spoke
to
lilly
of
marrying
another
woman
not
however
for
the
purpose
of
annoying
her
but
because
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
disburdening
himself
of
every
vexation
by
talking
it
over
with
her
his
mother
was
entertaining
an
enormously
wealthy
orphan
girl
of
course
for
richard
wholly
and
entirely
for
richard
she
sat
at
table
every
day
a
pale
strawy
blond
and
looked
at
him
questioningly
with
great
strange
eyes
are
you
soon
going
to
propose
his
mother
delivered
long
sermons
it
could
not
go
on
the
same
way
a
few
more
seasons
like
the
last
and
all
the
respectable
families
would
point
the
finger
of
scorn
at
him
it
was
enough
to
drive
him
distracted
lilly
felt
as
if
glacial
waters
were
trickling
down
her
back
but
she
bore
up
bravely
she
smiled
at
him
and
betrayed
no
more
excitement
than
if
he
had
been
consulting
her
about
some
doubtful
factory
model
do
you
feel
you
could
get
to
love
her
she
asked
what
does
love
mean
he
rejoined
avoiding
her
gaze
well
everything
has
to
be
taken
into
consideration
you
talk
just
as
if
i
were
serious
about
it
he
cried
altogether
you
act
as
if
you
did
care
as
if
you
would
like
to
be
rid
of
me
in
a
twinkling
with
languid
eagerness
lilly
tried
to
assure
him
she
did
not
wish
to
stand
in
his
way
not
in
the
least
least
bit
she
had
only
his
happiness
at
heart
and
if
he
cared
to
make
her
proud
by
showing
confidence
in
her
he
would
not
take
this
step
neither
now
nor
later
without
discussing
it
with
her
beforehand
he
was
touched
he
kissed
her
and
said
oh
it
nonsense
but
the
conversation
left
lilly
as
in
a
nightmare
and
the
one
thought
obsessed
her
if
he
deserts
me
i
shall
sink
into
the
mire
after
all
grief
over
her
mother
death
was
a
vanishing
cloud
compared
with
this
torturing
anguish
the
vultures
mrs
jula
had
spoken
of
occurred
to
her
all
those
vultures
with
their
white
fronts
and
black
dress
suits
who
were
waiting
to
snatch
her
to
themselves
with
their
moneyed
claws
the
instant
her
friend
and
protector
abandoned
her
from
them
her
thoughts
flitted
to
those
other
vultures
in
kellermann
picture
who
perched
on
the
sunburnt
rocks
ready
to
pounce
on
the
naked
beauty
when
she
should
lose
the
strength
to
defend
herself
her
chains
are
her
weapons
thought
lilly
and
that
the
way
it
is
with
me
if
i
am
set
free
i
am
lost
the
next
day
she
and
richard
carefully
avoided
the
dangerous
topic
though
richard
remained
distraught
and
uneasy
finally
lilly
took
courage
and
though
her
feelings
compressed
her
throat
like
a
murderous
clutch
she
said
i
see
you
have
come
to
a
decision
yet
richard
would
you
like
to
bring
me
her
picture
so
that
i
can
see
what
she
is
like
no
one
knows
you
so
well
as
i
do
and
no
one
will
know
so
well
whether
she
suits
you
or
not
richard
violently
denied
that
he
was
undecided
what
did
care
for
that
doll
of
a
girl
but
his
resentment
was
disingenuous
and
his
eyes
stared
into
vacancy
she
had
five
millions
and
the
next
day
he
actually
brought
the
photograph
lilly
laid
it
down
without
unwrapping
it
mere
contact
with
the
picture
made
her
hands
tremble
she
feared
the
first
sight
of
the
girl
face
would
expose
her
own
great
distress
why
you
not
even
looking
at
it
said
richard
with
some
disappointment
in
his
tone
time
enough
after
you
gone
said
lilly
rejoiced
that
she
could
smile
so
indifferently
she
called
to
him
when
he
was
out
in
the
hall
i
tell
you
you
know
then
the
next
instant
she
caught
up
the
picture
her
heart
knocked
at
her
ribs
but
first
she
had
to
wave
to
richard
as
was
her
habit
and
duty
and
then
and
then
a
girl
face
good
placid
somewhat
peaked
with
poor
though
amiable
eyes
her
blond
hair
was
plaited
country
fashion
and
the
heavy
braids
thick
as
a
woman
wrist
drew
her
head
back
a
bit
a
timid
smile
played
about
her
full
lips
something
just
to
be
loved
something
which
would
revive
with
happiness
as
a
spray
of
lilacs
in
fresh
water
not
turbulent
none
too
gifted
wifely
and
yielding
just
what
richard
needed
lilly
placed
the
picture
on
a
chair
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
in
front
of
it
she
prayed
and
wrestled
with
her
soul
she
had
to
reiterate
again
and
again
just
what
he
needs
he
wo
have
another
such
chance
and
the
five
millions
if
she
were
not
to
set
him
free
she
would
be
one
of
those
harpies
which
jula
said
the
world
of
respectability
considered
her
and
her
like
to
be
but
i
am
in
possession
therefore
mine
is
the
right
what
good
are
her
five
millions
to
me
if
i
go
to
ruin
on
account
of
them
why
need
i
sacrifice
myself
for
him
for
him
or
for
anybody
in
the
wide
world
harpy
harpy
rang
in
between
so
thought
the
vampires
described
in
children
mythologies
as
having
beautiful
hair
and
murderous
claws
i
will
tear
to
shreds
the
flesh
of
him
whom
i
possess
oh
what
a
night
she
crouched
in
bed
with
her
knees
drawn
up
and
her
face
buried
in
her
lap
sobbing
sobbing
at
last
toward
morning
she
found
what
she
had
been
seeking
out
of
tears
out
of
bitterness
out
of
shuddering
and
prayer
arose
the
alleviating
resolve
that
very
afternoon
when
he
came
she
would
tell
him
but
no
why
wait
until
the
afternoon
why
wait
until
he
entered
the
rooms
where
the
force
of
familiarity
his
loving
resistance
might
shiver
the
great
sacrificial
work
to
bits
it
must
be
in
some
other
place
where
she
seemed
more
of
a
stranger
to
him
which
she
could
leave
the
instant
she
felt
his
proximity
caused
her
to
waver
she
was
not
allowed
to
visit
him
in
his
office
without
special
permission
but
at
the
midday
recess
when
it
was
quieter
than
at
other
times
he
retired
to
his
back
room
for
his
actual
work
of
the
day
and
she
might
be
sure
of
entering
unseen
and
speaking
to
him
without
fear
of
interruption
so
sacred
a
resolve
sanctioned
everything
she
used
the
morning
for
assorting
his
letters
and
tying
them
together
she
wanted
to
hand
them
to
him
along
with
his
betrothed
picture
when
she
bade
him
farewell
he
need
never
fear
she
might
cause
him
trouble
in
the
future
then
she
dressed
more
carefully
than
usual
washed
herself
with
milk
of
lilacs
to
remove
the
traces
of
tears
waved
her
hair
and
drew
it
into
a
knot
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
as
she
had
seen
on
statues
of
greek
women
she
was
their
equal
like
them
serenely
raised
above
sorrow
and
joy
she
drove
to
the
office
the
clock
struck
quarter
past
one
when
she
stood
in
front
of
the
columned
gateway
nobody
was
to
be
seen
in
the
yard
except
the
porter
who
lifted
his
cap
with
a
confidential
smile
she
was
still
their
employer
mistress
if
only
she
had
taken
the
precaution
to
send
in
her
card
the
front
office
door
was
open
as
usual
when
he
worked
in
the
back
room
and
she
well
knew
the
secret
spring
of
the
gate
in
the
railing
she
prudently
knocked
at
the
inner
door
which
as
a
rule
stood
slightly
ajar
but
which
was
closed
come
in
he
said
she
stepped
in
and
faced
his
mother
lilly
had
never
seen
her
and
she
had
imagined
her
quite
quite
different
a
tall
thin
imposing
old
lady
next
to
richard
desk
sat
a
rotund
woman
with
a
black
lace
cap
on
her
grizzled
hair
she
looked
at
lilly
with
an
expression
of
surprise
and
displeasure
in
her
cold
grey
eyes
lilly
instantly
knew
it
was
she
richard
who
had
been
leaning
back
comfortably
in
his
revolving
chair
jumped
to
his
feet
rigid
with
fright
lilly
stared
at
the
old
lady
who
now
rose
from
her
seat
also
while
an
evil
gleam
of
anger
and
contempt
lighted
up
those
cold
eyes
a
fine
state
of
affairs
she
cried
turning
her
head
jerkily
from
richard
to
lilly
and
back
to
richard
i
not
secure
even
in
my
own
home
i
beg
of
you
richard
do
not
expose
me
to
another
meeting
with
a
person
of
this
sort
with
an
indignant
snort
she
pushed
past
lilly
who
stood
to
one
side
in
respectful
terror
what
are
you
doing
here
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
in
this
way
richard
had
never
shouted
at
her
so
before
he
planted
himself
squarely
in
front
of
her
thrust
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
gnawed
the
ends
of
his
moustache
his
head
hung
on
his
left
shoulder
he
looked
like
a
treacherous
butting
bull
she
wanted
to
hand
him
the
picture
and
the
letters
tell
him
everything
she
had
intended
to
but
her
voice
failed
her
knees
threatened
to
give
way
i
i
i
she
faltered
and
choked
i
i
i
he
mimicked
her
i
i
i
like
to
wriggle
myself
in
here
i
i
i
like
to
be
mistress
here
is
that
so
no
my
little
angel
this
ca
go
on
it
has
to
stop
at
once
i
long
had
my
suspicions
of
what
you
call
your
unhappy
love
of
the
factory
get
out
of
here
get
out
of
here
i
say
before
he
had
finished
lilly
was
out
she
still
held
the
parcel
in
a
convulsive
grip
she
reeled
as
she
walked
along
past
bright
red
houses
which
threatened
to
fall
on
her
a
truck
loaded
with
flour
bags
scattered
white
clouds
a
pulley
screeched
in
a
factory
yard
when
someone
came
toward
her
she
made
a
wide
détour
keeping
to
the
edge
of
the
pavement
she
feared
he
might
grin
his
contempt
at
her
a
skein
of
silk
thread
lay
on
the
pavement
lilly
picked
it
up
and
thought
of
hanging
herself
something
must
be
done
to
be
abandoned
very
well
if
it
could
not
be
helped
each
one
when
her
turn
came
would
have
to
resign
herself
to
her
fate
but
to
be
chased
away
thrown
out
like
a
thief
like
the
vilest
woman
of
the
street
to
be
shaken
off
like
a
disgusting
worm
to
be
spat
upon
something
must
be
done
anything
to
take
revenge
upon
him
even
if
he
was
now
unsusceptible
to
her
revenge
all
the
same
he
would
discover
he
had
been
to
blame
throughout
if
she
descended
into
the
mire
which
had
heretofore
filled
her
with
horror
if
she
went
to
ruin
something
must
be
done
any
deed
of
which
made
her
fit
to
be
treated
in
that
way
and
no
other
and
freed
her
from
those
torments
those
torments
her
heart
hung
in
her
breast
like
a
painful
swelling
she
could
have
drawn
a
line
about
it
so
sharply
defined
it
was
against
her
side
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
clutch
of
sharp
claws
again
those
lurking
vultures
occurred
to
her
the
vultures
of
kellermann
picture
they
were
waiting
for
lilly
czepanek
for
whom
else
suddenly
something
flashed
and
hissed
in
her
brain
like
a
tongue
of
fire
that
was
it
that
was
it
she
summoned
a
cab
on
on
whither
she
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
as
quickly
as
possible
to
kellermann
studio
she
ran
up
the
steps
the
same
steps
down
which
eight
months
before
she
had
glided
at
richard
side
rocked
in
bliss
all
she
stepped
into
the
dark
anteroom
which
had
the
stuffy
smell
of
a
badly
aired
bedroom
her
hand
almost
failed
her
as
she
knocked
at
the
studio
door
kellermann
in
his
breeches
and
slippers
was
squatting
on
the
floor
beside
the
turkish
tabouret
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
at
her
first
visit
he
was
busied
with
a
coffee
machine
and
looked
contented
and
seedy
mercy
on
us
he
said
and
drew
the
collar
of
his
together
what
signifies
this
sudden
appearance
o
noble
goddess
are
the
suns
setting
again
lilly
did
not
reply
she
laid
her
hat
and
wraps
on
a
chair
and
began
to
unhook
her
waist
looking
about
for
a
screen
there
was
none
the
models
who
came
to
pose
for
kellermann
were
not
squeamish
he
jumped
up
and
stared
at
her
when
he
realised
what
she
meant
to
do
he
broke
into
exclamations
of
delight
what
did
i
say
what
did
i
say
i
said
you
come
you
see
reached
the
point
at
which
we
screaming
to
be
set
free
i
not
screaming
she
replied
drawing
up
the
corners
of
her
mouth
disdainfully
if
you
please
look
somewhere
else
he
made
a
dash
for
the
picture
leaning
against
the
wall
in
its
blind
frame
blew
the
dust
off
drove
the
wedge
in
tight
and
adjusted
the
easel
laughing
all
the
while
and
grunting
she
came
after
all
lilly
had
torn
off
her
outer
garments
and
was
pulling
at
the
drawing
ribbon
of
her
chemise
her
paralysed
fingers
could
scarcely
untie
the
knot
now
she
stood
entirely
unclothed
the
garish
studio
light
pricked
her
flesh
painfully
as
with
a
thousand
needles
she
wanted
to
groan
and
creep
into
a
corner
but
she
turned
her
clenched
fists
outward
threw
back
her
shoulders
and
presented
herself
to
the
painter
greedy
gaze
why
do
you
begin
she
asked
as
she
spoke
she
felt
that
her
smarting
scorn
was
distorting
her
face
i
begin
immediately
he
stammered
choking
over
each
word
i
utter
a
syllable
or
the
vision
will
vanish
i
begin
he
snatched
up
the
palette
pressed
the
tubes
and
readjusted
the
picture
on
the
easel
he
made
a
few
strokes
then
threw
the
brushes
down
he
reeled
like
a
drunkard
no
use
this
way
he
said
mumbling
to
himself
you
must
pose
just
as
you
wish
she
replied
still
with
that
mocking
smile
and
stretched
out
her
arms
like
the
beauty
of
the
picture
he
was
not
yet
satisfied
and
wanted
to
approach
her
he
did
not
dare
to
i
will
move
the
mirror
so
that
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
is
wrong
in
your
pose
he
did
so
lilly
shuddered
a
strange
wild
animal
which
was
not
even
beautiful
seemed
to
be
standing
there
not
right
yet
she
heard
him
say
the
attitude
is
meaningless
got
to
know
what
it
for
he
went
to
the
back
of
the
studio
and
rummaged
among
all
sorts
of
gear
and
fetched
out
a
tremendously
thick
chain
the
colour
of
rusty
iron
which
did
not
clank
while
being
handled
it
wo
be
cold
and
wo
weigh
you
down
he
said
with
a
short
forced
laugh
it
made
of
papier
maché
then
she
had
to
suffer
his
coming
close
to
her
and
laying
the
chain
about
her
body
he
was
panting
and
his
breath
streamed
upon
her
hotly
each
tremulous
touch
of
his
fingers
was
like
a
sabre
slash
he
returned
to
the
easel
groped
for
the
brushes
and
began
to
paint
again
suddenly
he
cast
everything
from
him
seized
the
picture
with
both
hands
and
dashed
it
against
the
easel
one
of
the
rods
tore
through
the
canvas
and
split
it
in
two
for
god
sake
cried
lilly
he
threw
himself
upon
her
she
feebly
attempted
to
defend
herself
with
the
chain
but
the
chain
was
made
of
papier
maché
and
she
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
down
into
the
mire
quickly
with
closed
eyes
the
next
day
richard
paid
his
customary
afternoon
visit
his
lids
were
reddened
and
his
eyes
glassy
he
looked
completely
crushed
but
he
behaved
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
lilly
had
scarcely
expected
him
and
she
received
him
with
frigid
astonishment
oh
he
said
on
account
of
yesterday
after
you
left
i
had
a
tough
discussion
with
mama
you
must
come
to
the
factory
i
had
to
promise
her
that
as
for
the
rest
i
think
we
not
speak
of
it
any
more
the
young
lady
leaving
this
evening
so
let
kiss
they
kissed
and
all
was
as
before
chapter
x
once
more
the
chestnuts
put
on
their
yellow
cloaks
and
the
peep
holes
in
the
foliage
widened
from
her
window
lilly
could
see
the
ducks
foraging
and
the
odorous
barges
on
their
laborious
way
to
market
sunk
deep
in
the
water
under
their
summer
cargo
once
more
the
world
muffled
itself
up
for
winter
weather
once
more
metropolitan
amusements
turned
on
their
gay
lights
in
decent
the
chase
began
again
richard
objected
to
remaining
like
a
pickle
in
a
jar
this
time
however
they
entirely
renounced
box
seats
at
dazzling
shows
and
suppers
at
aristocratic
restaurants
richard
no
longer
had
to
establish
himself
triumphantly
in
the
possession
of
a
famous
at
the
same
time
cheap
de
grande
they
quietly
remained
on
a
level
where
german
champagne
reigns
supreme
and
the
star
kempinski
is
in
the
ascendant
but
here
too
in
cabarets
and
theatres
where
smoking
is
allowed
in
jolly
little
nooks
and
respectable
looking
back
rooms
they
passed
numberless
hours
in
riotous
abandon
the
women
who
in
the
other
world
had
felt
somewhat
out
of
place
and
embarrassed
enjoyed
themselves
better
in
these
more
modest
surroundings
and
the
gentlemen
were
content
that
their
shirt
fronts
retained
the
starch
longer
the
personnel
remained
about
the
same
only
a
few
dandies
dropped
away
who
saw
no
fun
in
life
unless
it
offered
them
an
occasional
opportunity
to
receive
a
condescending
nod
from
a
few
lieutenants
of
the
guard
in
citizens
clothes
lilly
followed
the
crowd
and
thought
it
had
to
be
so
for
the
most
part
she
sat
there
saying
little
and
smiling
a
friendly
smile
she
permitted
the
gentlemen
to
pay
her
court
and
was
moderately
responsive
she
listened
indifferently
to
the
confidences
of
the
ladies
all
of
whom
were
to
her
because
as
everyone
soon
realised
lilly
had
no
desire
to
poach
on
another
preserves
they
might
have
taken
her
to
be
limited
or
phlegmatic
if
from
time
to
time
the
champagne
had
not
relaxed
her
rigidity
and
enlivened
her
with
a
different
spirit
she
slowly
came
out
of
her
state
of
torpor
her
eyes
flashed
her
cheeks
reddened
she
laughed
aloud
made
madcap
remarks
told
the
colonel
club
jokes
and
finally
fell
into
a
sort
of
ecstasy
in
which
she
sang
comic
songs
in
a
tremulous
chirp
imitated
actors
and
even
danced
the
bold
dances
she
had
seen
on
the
variety
stage
her
memory
was
incredibly
good
she
remembered
things
she
had
heard
only
once
and
quite
unconsciously
for
in
her
normal
state
she
recalled
even
less
than
others
the
wine
first
had
to
wash
away
the
barriers
that
always
hemmed
her
being
her
associates
soon
became
aware
of
this
and
tried
to
trick
her
into
the
condition
that
promised
them
a
merry
entertainment
but
she
resisted
with
all
her
might
she
waged
constant
warfare
without
even
richard
as
an
ally
it
flattered
his
vanity
to
have
his
beautiful
mistress
admired
because
of
her
talents
the
next
day
lilly
always
felt
bruised
and
battered
and
despondent
and
sometimes
when
the
field
of
her
spiritual
vision
was
completely
filled
with
red
kicking
legs
and
the
empty
teasing
dribble
of
comic
songs
she
heard
a
still
small
voice
in
admonition
there
was
a
time
when
you
lived
otherwise
there
was
a
time
when
you
aspired
to
the
heights
but
lilly
feared
to
listen
to
this
voice
she
felt
she
was
worthless
because
she
was
defenceless
and
because
nobody
was
there
who
understood
her
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
frequently
on
the
evenings
she
was
left
to
herself
she
slipped
out
of
the
house
as
if
she
were
committing
an
evil
deed
and
took
a
seat
in
the
gallery
of
some
good
theatre
where
she
thought
no
one
would
recognise
her
or
at
a
concert
among
the
music
students
who
sat
on
the
steps
or
leaned
against
the
railings
following
the
selections
with
thick
scores
in
their
hands
lilly
behaved
as
if
she
were
one
of
them
but
concerts
no
longer
touched
her
she
felt
uneasy
and
out
of
place
and
turned
her
attention
to
some
young
man
because
of
his
bold
profile
or
his
fine
head
of
hair
he
is
one
of
those
favoured
talented
persons
she
thought
tormented
and
looked
at
him
long
and
languishly
until
he
returned
her
dallying
with
ardour
though
she
burned
to
have
him
speak
to
her
she
lacked
the
courage
to
grant
him
additional
signs
of
her
favour
having
before
her
eyes
jula
appalling
example
besides
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
was
sufficient
enjoyment
already
she
was
so
completely
under
the
spell
of
an
erotic
world
that
every
excitement
of
her
mood
was
immediately
transmuted
into
a
desirous
love
game
and
the
longing
that
eternal
toothache
of
which
jula
had
spoken
had
begun
to
drill
her
nerves
it
had
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
it
filled
her
sleep
with
flaming
pictures
and
converted
her
waking
hours
into
a
twilight
doze
she
waited
but
nobody
came
nobody
took
the
trouble
to
pick
up
her
lost
soul
from
out
of
the
dust
there
was
only
one
man
who
observed
her
and
seemed
to
have
a
suspicion
of
what
was
taking
place
in
her
soul
he
was
salmoni
salmoni
was
considered
a
great
man
one
of
the
luminaries
in
berlin
intellectual
life
he
was
editor
of
an
art
magazine
which
had
once
conducted
a
revolutionary
campaign
against
the
great
men
of
the
old
school
and
had
fashioned
new
gods
erected
new
altars
at
which
the
masses
might
burn
incense
but
the
steady
burning
of
incense
was
not
in
salmoni
line
he
promptly
bethought
himself
that
the
divinities
before
whom
every
tom
dick
or
harry
was
crawling
on
his
knees
were
at
bottom
creations
of
his
and
of
his
friends
fetiches
to
be
rejected
just
as
they
had
been
exalted
and
he
began
a
merry
war
upon
them
also
people
easily
endured
salmoni
hate
his
quips
sputtered
in
the
air
harmless
as
skyrockets
nobody
believed
his
imputations
the
only
time
he
was
dangerous
was
when
he
showed
pitying
benevolence
then
reputation
was
surely
at
stake
in
certain
circles
salmoni
praise
was
equivalent
to
a
death
sentence
as
in
the
previous
winter
the
distinguished
salmoni
condescended
every
now
and
then
to
take
part
in
the
innocent
sport
of
the
little
circle
whose
forte
was
not
exactly
intellectuality
his
appearance
always
caused
a
flutter
of
joyous
reverence
the
company
instantly
moved
closer
to
make
place
for
him
and
as
soon
as
he
leaned
back
gently
in
his
chair
smiled
his
sad
compassionate
smile
and
stroked
the
peak
of
his
van
dyke
beard
they
hung
on
his
lips
expectantly
awaiting
a
titillating
stream
of
spiteful
sallies
but
the
jester
rôle
did
not
always
suit
him
he
plunged
into
profound
or
dreamed
in
silence
according
to
his
mood
sometimes
he
even
showed
a
naïve
trusting
side
of
his
nature
like
a
leopard
playing
with
dogs
he
seldom
addressed
lilly
but
his
piercing
eyes
often
glided
over
her
face
as
if
to
spy
upon
her
feelings
and
grope
about
in
her
soul
one
evening
he
seated
himself
next
to
her
and
asked
her
to
cut
his
meat
for
him
he
had
strained
his
wrist
throttling
a
certain
celebrity
waxing
more
intimate
he
next
asked
her
to
feed
him
though
his
left
hand
had
by
no
means
been
disabled
so
for
the
first
time
they
entered
into
a
conversation
lilly
quailed
she
feared
she
might
not
acquit
herself
creditably
i
am
surprised
he
said
you
been
going
about
with
this
loud
crew
for
over
a
year
and
i
do
read
the
slang
in
your
eyes
yet
slang
in
my
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
slang
in
a
person
eyes
do
me
the
favour
to
regard
the
women
here
he
pointed
furtively
at
jula
welter
karla
and
a
few
others
look
at
the
way
they
roll
their
eyes
and
exchange
glances
it
the
lingo
of
a
well
i
say
vice
i
despise
words
without
nuance
i
say
of
a
thievish
fancy
do
you
understand
i
think
so
faltered
lilly
but
you
still
have
some
of
the
childlike
expression
you
had
when
you
made
your
début
not
altogether
a
fleck
of
disdain
is
in
your
eyes
disdain
is
not
the
right
word
at
the
edge
of
deserts
there
are
certain
salt
seas
dark
green
and
empty
do
you
catch
the
idea
because
the
ground
is
poisonous
possibly
said
lilly
constrained
nevertheless
it
wonderful
your
soul
like
a
filter
it
assimilates
nothing
but
what
it
wants
to
or
have
you
a
secret
store
to
draw
on
which
gives
you
the
right
to
mock
at
us
some
constant
ideal
some
goal
in
the
hazy
distance
some
great
song
a
song
of
songs
lilly
started
up
with
a
faint
outcry
but
not
so
faint
as
to
fail
to
attract
general
attention
i
merely
stepped
on
her
foot
salmoni
explained
and
she
is
still
innocent
enough
to
consider
it
unintentional
all
laughed
a
joke
exactly
suited
to
their
understanding
he
whispered
bending
toward
her
shoulder
i
pretend
not
to
have
heard
your
involuntary
avowal
that
alone
has
value
in
my
estimation
which
is
voluntary
and
i
will
not
ask
you
as
i
did
a
year
ago
is
thy
quest
here
lovely
lady
i
will
ask
you
hast
thou
to
lose
here
i
myself
will
furnish
the
answer
your
style
you
have
your
style
to
lose
you
are
on
the
point
of
becoming
styleless
which
is
always
a
misfortune
and
a
crime
to
me
style
is
virtue
greatness
genuineness
force
religion
a
quality
all
in
one
and
a
few
things
more
remain
bodily
and
spiritually
intangible
rise
to
a
healthy
gladsome
vice
dress
your
hair
for
evening
prayers
or
let
it
flow
over
the
pillow
like
a
bacchante
but
decide
which
i
believe
a
moment
ago
you
were
pleading
for
nuance
said
lilly
the
edge
of
whose
wit
was
sharpened
by
his
and
now
you
advocating
a
dogma
hear
hear
he
praised
her
excellent
but
no
i
not
preaching
a
dogma
i
preaching
the
exercise
of
one
will
the
will
to
personality
do
you
understand
the
result
will
be
rich
enough
in
nuances
undoubtedly
you
have
the
material
in
you
for
a
but
alas
not
the
courage
well
then
not
the
material
she
flashed
back
happily
he
laughed
like
a
child
in
one
old
age
one
gets
lectures
on
logic
from
little
virtuous
women
he
magnanimously
allowed
her
the
pleasure
of
having
outdone
him
in
repartee
thereafter
lilly
reflected
much
upon
the
conversation
what
a
vast
deal
he
knew
of
her
was
he
in
alliance
with
supernatural
powers
the
will
to
personality
he
had
said
she
felt
blissful
up
to
the
heights
again
on
another
occasion
as
they
were
walking
behind
their
companions
along
friederichstrasse
still
gaily
alive
at
midnight
he
adopted
a
different
tone
i
have
a
sure
feeling
that
you
are
afraid
of
me
he
said
i
she
queried
confused
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
why
should
i
be
because
you
know
i
have
a
message
for
you
a
message
to
which
in
the
bottom
of
your
heart
you
do
feel
equal
i
do
understand
she
stammered
though
she
fully
took
in
his
meaning
she
knew
precisely
what
rôle
he
could
play
in
her
life
if
i
am
a
man
who
likes
tones
pianissimo
i
do
care
to
blow
my
sensations
on
a
comb
otherwise
your
ears
might
have
tingled
on
certain
occasions
however
i
must
say
it
abominable
to
see
a
woman
like
you
a
woman
created
to
wander
on
the
heights
of
thought
and
enjoyment
seduced
by
a
few
bismarck
herrings
into
cutting
capers
with
them
i
wo
mention
names
but
i
assure
you
you
ca
get
drunk
on
lukewarm
dish
water
and
intoxication
is
the
great
thing
in
life
at
least
while
our
blood
runs
lively
in
our
veins
lilly
trembled
on
his
arm
they
were
passing
a
crowd
of
roysterers
young
fellows
shouldering
their
canes
with
swimming
eyes
dreaming
into
space
one
whistled
wagner
another
sang
a
students
song
and
sweet
little
cast
longing
seductive
glances
at
them
lilly
and
salmoni
passed
more
people
adults
and
girls
men
and
youths
all
seemed
under
the
spell
of
the
same
transport
it
was
like
a
great
dance
at
which
each
offered
his
neighbour
hand
and
mouth
and
body
and
soul
what
can
i
do
she
whispered
dropping
her
chin
on
her
heaving
breast
i
will
tell
you
he
replied
with
a
smile
which
harboured
dark
promises
you
must
learn
to
live
another
life
along
with
this
one
one
all
for
yourself
for
yourself
and
a
few
select
do
you
understand
as
a
frenchman
once
said
you
must
lay
out
a
secret
garden
in
which
you
will
cultivate
in
absolute
quiet
those
thoughts
and
desires
that
seem
dear
to
you
and
above
all
those
that
seem
to
be
forbidden
and
those
that
you
have
stolen
by
the
way
no
matter
how
do
you
understand
whatever
i
have
stolen
has
brought
me
misfortune
said
lilly
hesitatingly
rather
the
law
which
calls
it
stolen
the
distinction
is
a
difficult
one
to
make
however
you
may
believe
me
in
this
so
long
as
we
are
not
permeated
with
the
religion
of
do
you
understand
me
child
so
long
as
we
have
rooted
out
the
words
and
from
our
thoughts
our
road
is
not
perfect
we
continue
to
knock
our
toes
on
the
crushed
stones
that
the
others
heap
up
ahead
of
us
under
the
pretext
that
they
are
levelling
the
way
sometimes
they
do
said
lilly
recalling
all
the
good
things
she
had
received
from
richard
he
smiled
at
her
with
compassionate
indulgence
you
seem
to
be
suffering
from
what
i
call
chain
madness
what
is
that
asked
lilly
suspecting
to
her
dismay
that
he
again
divined
what
lay
in
her
innermost
being
could
he
know
of
the
shameful
rôle
that
a
certain
chained
beauty
had
played
in
her
life
it
is
said
he
continued
that
if
galley
slaves
who
have
worn
chains
for
many
years
are
liberated
they
can
not
endure
their
freedom
they
complain
that
their
arms
and
legs
have
been
chopped
off
they
miss
the
support
and
weight
of
their
chains
you
have
such
beautiful
arms
for
stretching
upward
just
exercise
them
a
little
and
such
long
legs
for
running
away
she
supplemented
with
a
tortured
laugh
the
only
question
is
whither
oh
oh
why
run
away
immediately
he
asked
stroking
her
hand
which
rested
on
his
arm
and
speaking
as
to
a
child
you
would
simply
run
into
the
arms
of
another
duty
first
you
must
be
free
inwardly
you
must
first
forget
to
fetch
and
carry
for
persons
who
are
themselves
meant
to
fetch
and
carry
teach
me
she
burst
out
i
will
bring
you
some
books
he
said
as
if
deliberating
books
which
will
lead
you
back
to
yourself
at
noon
i
will
at
that
moment
they
were
separated
in
bed
lilly
lay
with
clasped
hands
smiling
up
at
the
ceiling
she
was
again
aspiring
to
the
heights
but
the
next
day
when
he
was
to
come
dread
fell
upon
her
again
dread
of
him
of
richard
of
herself
it
was
the
first
secret
visit
the
first
to
knock
a
breach
in
the
peace
of
her
home
when
she
saw
him
step
from
the
cab
with
several
volumes
in
his
arm
she
flew
into
the
kitchen
and
told
the
maid
to
say
she
was
not
at
home
but
the
instant
he
left
she
seized
the
books
which
he
had
brought
some
were
printed
in
roman
type
and
looked
dreadfully
scientific
however
they
were
intelligible
and
lilly
took
up
one
after
the
other
what
she
read
sent
the
blood
coursing
turbulently
through
her
veins
and
mounted
to
her
head
like
sweet
wine
all
the
books
spoke
of
the
will
to
power
the
free
man
the
right
to
live
one
life
the
religion
of
passion
and
similar
things
in
each
pure
beauty
was
extolled
as
the
goal
of
human
endeavours
in
each
the
word
individuality
recurred
numberless
times
in
numberless
connections
each
taught
you
to
look
down
upon
your
with
vigorous
pride
and
despise
them
as
a
blunted
debased
tortured
and
enslaved
mass
in
each
you
wandered
along
in
blessed
solitude
or
in
the
company
of
a
very
few
noble
souls
on
free
mountain
heights
surrounded
by
an
eternally
bright
ether
it
was
a
constant
offering
of
incense
an
insatiable
lashing
of
oneself
into
satiety
pleasant
murder
rape
the
main
subjects
invariably
were
intoxication
dreams
life
festivals
and
ecstasy
thus
a
veil
of
intoxication
and
dreams
was
spread
over
lilly
soul
she
felt
she
was
enveloped
in
a
sapphire
haze
shot
with
the
purple
of
a
distant
glow
she
heard
hot
wrathful
music
storming
onward
in
discords
like
mænads
tearing
down
every
hindrance
in
their
way
she
felt
she
was
climbing
up
perpendicular
rocks
ever
higher
ever
higher
fighting
the
whole
time
against
the
dizziness
which
threatened
to
cast
her
back
into
the
abyss
but
she
did
not
sink
she
clung
to
the
edge
which
bruised
her
hands
and
laughed
down
laughed
laughed
at
the
sorry
wretches
there
below
crawling
along
in
flocks
permitting
themselves
to
be
ground
to
death
for
their
bit
of
daily
bread
then
she
felt
sorry
that
she
alone
had
scaled
such
heights
that
she
alone
should
be
up
there
enjoying
the
wild
golden
sunlight
while
all
the
others
little
conceived
that
deliverance
was
at
hand
she
wanted
to
hold
out
her
hand
to
her
poor
starving
brothers
and
sisters
and
draw
them
up
after
her
but
they
could
not
understand
her
message
of
salvation
he
had
said
message
of
salvation
she
saw
wasting
faces
dank
with
the
sweat
of
death
glassy
eyes
unable
to
turn
from
the
gleaming
penny
their
pay
she
saw
pregnant
bodies
swollen
yet
emaciated
the
working
woman
in
richard
wrapping
room
recurred
to
her
she
recalled
her
hands
flying
in
feverish
haste
about
the
swaying
doll
she
and
others
recurred
to
lilly
with
the
timid
hate
and
the
hopeless
yearning
in
their
weary
eyes
her
unhappy
love
for
the
factory
which
she
thought
had
been
extinguished
forever
on
that
day
of
shame
awoke
within
her
again
as
a
quiet
painful
tenderness
like
the
spring
anticipations
that
tremble
in
us
when
the
february
snows
begin
to
melt
this
to
be
sure
was
hardly
the
sense
or
purpose
of
books
but
they
served
another
purpose
most
admirably
her
faint
toothache
rose
to
a
veritable
anguish
the
desire
for
a
man
any
man
not
richard
who
understood
her
and
swept
her
along
with
him
overwhelmed
her
with
such
force
that
she
could
only
twist
this
way
and
that
and
feel
she
would
perish
under
the
lash
somewhere
the
one
was
surely
to
be
found
was
it
not
possible
for
a
favouring
wave
in
this
sea
of
humanity
to
toss
him
to
her
feet
one
evening
she
put
on
simple
dark
clothes
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
seamstress
returning
from
work
and
slipped
down
the
street
as
she
used
to
when
richard
house
drew
her
to
it
with
a
thousand
secret
threads
since
she
was
unskilled
in
strolling
about
aimlessly
and
needed
a
goal
she
listened
to
the
voice
of
her
newly
awakened
love
and
took
the
accustomed
route
to
alte
jakobstrasse
on
the
way
she
shudderingly
avoided
two
old
beaux
and
a
fresh
clerk
the
latticed
gates
of
the
famous
portal
cried
an
iron
halt
she
stood
a
long
time
pressed
up
against
her
old
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
and
stared
at
the
house
to
which
fate
had
anchored
her
lights
were
burning
in
his
mother
room
the
two
gas
jets
of
the
chandelier
resembled
her
cold
clear
eyes
the
rest
of
the
jets
were
not
turned
on
probably
from
motives
of
economy
of
the
factory
nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
the
dark
top
of
the
chimney
towering
above
the
roof
of
the
house
in
front
a
sorry
greeting
nevertheless
a
greeting
she
would
have
liked
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
the
beloved
staircase
also
but
she
no
longer
dared
to
cross
the
street
then
as
if
after
a
good
deed
accomplished
she
turned
homeward
feeling
at
ease
she
repeated
the
visit
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
week
she
began
to
feel
that
the
aimless
journeys
were
a
life
necessity
once
just
as
she
was
disposing
herself
comfortably
in
her
protecting
doorway
an
elegant
slim
gentleman
who
evidently
had
come
the
same
way
behind
her
stopped
and
raised
his
hat
salmoni
lilly
in
her
fright
nearly
forgot
to
return
his
greeting
if
he
were
to
betray
her
to
richard
richard
would
assume
that
jealousy
or
even
worse
had
driven
her
there
well
well
began
salmoni
complacently
rolling
the
words
in
his
mouth
it
strikes
me
as
somewhat
touching
that
we
should
meet
directly
opposite
liebert
dehnicke
as
you
know
i
a
gentle
nature
a
soul
in
socks
as
it
were
so
i
refrain
from
asking
you
what
stirrings
of
your
heart
prompted
you
to
come
here
you
know
the
of
the
queen
who
sallied
forth
to
find
her
king
and
ended
in
finding
a
swineherd
thus
a
pearl
may
stray
into
a
bronze
ware
factory
i
should
not
have
permitted
myself
to
follow
you
intentionally
i
was
seduced
by
a
certain
play
of
lines
and
curves
perhaps
a
certain
suspicion
of
brilliance
shone
through
but
a
young
pheasant
should
not
be
shot
out
of
season
let
your
fruit
ripen
is
a
very
sound
motto
and
not
only
with
respect
to
love
but
it
questionable
whether
mottoes
are
worth
the
while
they
smack
of
respectability
and
respectability
smacks
of
virginia
tobacco
and
virginia
tobacco
smells
and
is
celebrated
far
and
wide
it
smells
do
you
get
my
profound
meaning
i
should
like
to
leave
this
spot
said
lilly
if
we
were
to
be
seen
here
oh
here
of
all
places
we
may
be
seen
together
he
rejoined
laughing
with
childlike
glee
it
would
take
a
perverse
imagination
to
assume
that
we
selected
this
very
house
for
a
secret
rendezvous
but
as
you
wish
he
offered
her
his
arm
she
declined
they
walked
side
by
side
through
dark
tortuous
streets
on
the
farther
west
side
he
talked
to
her
steadily
one
idea
suggested
another
one
wheel
of
fire
set
free
another
sometimes
it
appeared
to
lilly
he
had
totally
forgotten
her
presence
and
was
speaking
for
his
own
delight
in
the
play
of
his
fancy
what
he
said
seemed
to
have
no
bearing
upon
herself
and
her
sorry
existence
but
no
she
was
mistaken
his
gold
had
been
coined
for
her
after
all
he
merely
gave
too
much
and
her
brain
lacked
space
to
receive
all
of
it
he
walked
with
an
elastic
somewhat
tripping
tread
his
cane
stuck
head
downward
in
his
coat
pocket
tapped
against
his
shoulder
his
white
silk
necktie
gleamed
she
saw
nothing
else
of
him
and
he
talked
talked
sometimes
she
felt
that
she
was
being
boxed
on
the
ear
and
anon
that
she
was
being
stroked
tenderly
when
he
made
mock
of
richard
and
richard
friends
she
wanted
to
contradict
him
but
he
never
mentioned
names
besides
she
had
always
thought
the
same
it
seemed
to
her
he
alluded
cautiously
to
her
aristocratic
past
chose
pictures
from
country
life
extolled
discreet
horseback
rides
and
the
transports
awakened
by
reddish
golden
dawns
lilly
felt
he
had
been
present
at
all
the
events
of
her
life
i
have
lived
a
good
deal
in
castles
he
added
by
way
of
explanation
i
know
it
all
oh
if
his
past
had
been
similar
so
he
drilled
ever
deeper
into
her
soul
when
he
began
to
speak
of
the
books
he
had
brought
her
he
considerately
ignored
her
having
denied
herself
the
time
he
had
called
she
ventured
a
languid
resistance
please
do
lend
me
anything
of
the
sort
again
she
entreated
why
not
the
books
confuse
and
sicken
me
i
do
know
you
said
they
would
lead
me
to
myself
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
me
everything
was
growing
strange
which
i
had
once
looked
upon
as
right
and
sacred
perhaps
it
should
be
so
he
replied
setting
his
cane
perhaps
that
is
the
prime
demand
i
have
to
make
of
you
in
the
name
of
a
higher
life
let
me
tell
you
a
little
fable
apropos
once
upon
a
time
there
were
two
good
old
missionaries
to
satisfy
a
strong
spiritual
craving
they
wanted
to
spread
christianity
in
central
africa
there
is
really
no
need
for
such
queer
fish
but
they
do
exist
and
we
must
accept
the
fact
they
took
a
small
portable
organ
with
them
for
enhancing
the
solemnity
of
their
sermons
in
the
sweat
of
their
brows
and
the
encouraging
heat
of
the
tropics
they
dragged
it
hundreds
of
miles
into
the
interior
where
dwelt
the
poor
naked
savages
upon
whom
they
had
designs
there
they
set
their
organ
down
and
began
to
play
but
scarcely
did
the
poor
naked
savages
hear
the
first
chords
when
they
took
up
their
clubs
and
beat
the
good
missionaries
to
death
on
account
of
the
spirits
of
course
who
resided
in
the
chest
life
does
the
same
to
us
if
we
attempt
to
play
on
the
good
old
organ
of
our
moral
exactions
lilly
felt
she
could
not
cope
with
his
superior
intellect
now
he
laid
her
arm
in
his
without
question
and
she
did
not
venture
to
withdraw
it
they
walked
along
lowering
factory
walls
amid
whose
dark
masses
a
lantern
now
and
then
spread
its
milky
circle
of
light
scaffoldings
stretched
their
bony
arms
to
the
sky
and
from
parallel
streets
came
the
intermittent
clang
of
electric
tram
gongs
where
are
we
going
asked
lilly
anxiously
we
going
out
of
the
way
of
society
and
if
i
wanted
to
exploit
the
present
conjuncture
of
circumstances
i
should
profit
by
your
being
lost
your
feeling
that
you
need
protection
but
i
not
a
calculating
nature
in
matters
of
emotion
i
like
a
child
i
take
whatever
the
heavens
rain
down
on
me
are
you
the
same
way
i
too
heavy
replied
lilly
ready
to
bare
her
soul
to
him
i
full
of
scruples
i
think
a
lot
over
everything
the
question
is
you
think
he
said
gaily
she
wanted
to
reply
and
talk
to
him
tell
him
all
her
thoughts
she
felt
like
holding
out
her
heart
on
her
open
palm
so
that
nothing
should
remain
concealed
from
him
but
shame
before
his
great
wisdom
sealed
her
lips
why
do
you
take
the
trouble
to
bother
with
a
stupid
thing
like
me
she
asked
to
show
him
her
humility
at
least
perhaps
because
i
have
a
mission
to
fulfil
in
your
life
i
say
because
one
can
never
be
sure
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
as
reflex
action
of
the
emotions
certain
will
teach
us
though
his
meaning
was
not
at
all
clear
to
lilly
a
hesitating
sense
of
happiness
stole
over
her
that
so
mighty
a
man
should
actually
concern
himself
with
her
you
are
entirely
in
his
power
she
thought
and
you
will
be
whatever
he
wants
you
to
be
at
that
moment
he
drew
her
arm
a
little
closer
and
her
pressure
in
response
brought
his
hand
for
an
instant
on
her
breast
she
was
overwhelmed
with
fright
he
might
think
she
was
offering
herself
to
him
if
he
were
to
take
her
home
were
to
ask
i
like
to
get
into
a
tram
she
faltered
i
very
tired
he
whistled
for
a
cab
which
just
then
came
swaying
out
of
the
fog
no
no
she
burst
out
thinking
of
nothing
but
that
she
must
not
lightly
forego
the
joy
of
his
friendship
not
with
you
i
must
go
home
alone
on
account
she
tore
her
arm
from
his
and
ran
to
the
next
stopping
place
so
quickly
that
he
was
just
about
able
to
reach
her
before
she
jumped
on
the
first
tram
that
came
along
she
scarcely
said
the
smile
with
which
he
looked
after
her
was
by
no
means
melancholy
he
might
he
should
triumph
she
lilly
czepanek
was
once
again
aspiring
to
the
heights
three
days
later
they
met
again
this
time
in
a
large
company
which
had
visited
a
and
was
to
wind
up
the
evening
at
a
respectable
bodega
unluckily
somebody
else
took
the
seat
at
her
side
which
she
had
carefully
reserved
for
him
that
upset
her
the
champagne
heated
up
everybody
spirits
lilly
out
of
spite
and
boredom
drank
more
than
was
good
for
her
provocative
merriness
burned
in
her
eyes
her
cheeks
took
on
the
baldwin
apple
hue
that
they
all
dearly
loved
her
laughter
rang
out
clear
her
body
moved
more
nonchalantly
suddenly
she
heard
a
general
outcry
lilly
lilly
we
want
lilly
terror
stopped
her
pulse
she
had
never
ventured
to
perform
in
his
presence
in
fact
she
had
not
been
asked
to
when
he
had
been
there
for
then
formed
the
centre
of
attraction
but
she
felt
i
can
do
it
i
will
show
him
what
i
am
she
rose
brushed
her
hair
from
her
forehead
and
gave
herself
a
little
shake
as
was
her
wont
when
she
jerked
aside
the
everyday
lilly
the
lilly
the
lilly
of
the
oppressed
feelings
the
lilly
who
feared
to
face
her
the
lilly
she
made
a
dash
and
began
first
she
imitated
the
beautiful
otéro
and
crowed
and
cuckooed
her
auditors
rolled
with
laughter
then
she
hit
off
certain
cabaret
stars
sucking
her
fingers
like
an
innocent
babe
she
sang
in
flute
tones
please
let
me
in
your
room
she
croaked
in
a
droll
bass
once
i
was
ambassador
and
peeping
from
behind
the
clothes
rack
she
cooed
the
song
of
the
passionate
dove
coo
coo
coo
kiek
they
insisted
on
her
concluding
with
a
fandango
she
protested
in
vain
they
shoved
the
tables
against
the
wall
and
lilly
making
her
own
music
through
her
teeth
whirled
about
the
room
more
madly
than
ever
before
and
finally
collapsed
in
a
corner
almost
swooning
the
tumult
of
applause
promised
never
to
subside
the
women
kissed
her
again
and
again
the
men
stroked
her
hair
and
arms
the
stiff
district
attorney
sounded
a
trumpet
blast
and
richard
quite
pale
with
pride
stood
there
in
his
napoleon
attitude
tugging
at
his
moustache
but
salmoni
remained
at
a
distance
sad
and
modest
as
if
it
all
concerned
him
not
in
the
least
the
only
sign
by
which
she
knew
he
realised
it
was
all
meant
for
him
was
a
rapid
glance
of
understanding
which
he
threw
to
her
like
a
laurel
wreath
she
was
still
rocking
in
the
tempest
when
the
company
prepared
to
break
up
that
had
been
intoxication
the
sort
of
which
he
had
spoken
it
hissed
like
a
flame
through
her
heart
and
limbs
salmoni
himself
helped
her
on
with
her
fur
coat
richard
was
busy
paying
the
waiter
and
while
he
deliberately
laid
the
sable
scarf
about
her
shoulders
he
whispered
close
to
her
ear
may
i
come
yes
she
screamed
alarmed
at
herself
then
in
defiance
of
her
own
cowardice
she
turned
abruptly
on
her
heels
and
shouted
sharply
as
in
anger
directly
in
his
face
yes
yes
yes
yes
what
the
matter
everybody
asked
she
merely
laughed
shortly
what
did
she
care
for
the
others
was
she
aspiring
to
the
heights
again
the
next
morning
it
was
all
a
spectral
dream
the
one
clear
point
was
he
coming
with
the
applause
still
ringing
in
her
ears
she
had
stretched
herself
and
thought
now
he
knows
what
i
am
now
he
knows
i
no
dull
shrivelled
creature
for
the
valleys
no
slave
nature
no
sheep
that
runs
with
the
flock
no
fool
who
voluntarily
conforms
to
each
and
every
convention
now
he
knows
i
a
free
proud
woman
who
like
himself
drinks
in
the
light
on
the
heights
one
of
those
complete
women
those
mænads
who
dance
a
wild
dance
over
abysms
and
mock
at
death
even
when
he
has
them
in
his
clutches
then
her
faintheartedness
crept
over
her
again
what
after
all
had
she
done
besides
drink
herself
into
a
champagne
mood
sing
a
few
comic
songs
and
dance
an
abandoned
dance
she
had
behaved
like
a
danseuse
and
had
harvested
the
very
doubtful
approval
of
a
audience
if
that
alone
was
required
for
belonging
to
the
elect
to
the
mighty
laughing
chosen
ones
of
whom
salmoni
books
spoke
no
oh
no
after
last
night
performance
he
could
feel
nothing
but
contempt
for
her
or
at
most
pity
it
was
to
tell
her
this
to
her
face
that
he
would
come
to
visit
her
if
at
all
he
would
let
her
feel
her
lowness
and
then
go
his
own
way
benevolent
but
untouched
she
would
not
suffer
him
to
go
she
would
cling
to
him
and
cry
you
promised
to
lead
me
up
to
the
heights
out
of
these
depths
of
distress
out
of
this
insipid
existence
out
of
this
void
be
true
to
your
word
do
not
desert
me
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
i
will
be
your
thing
your
creature
but
do
desert
me
in
feverish
expectancy
she
dressed
waved
her
hair
and
rouged
her
lips
pale
from
nights
of
pleasure
she
made
herself
as
beautiful
as
she
could
a
little
before
twelve
the
bell
rang
he
no
jula
as
if
by
mutual
agreement
she
and
jula
had
avoided
each
other
since
that
evening
of
confidences
and
now
without
having
announced
her
visit
here
she
stood
wearing
her
most
cordial
expression
and
asking
for
a
brief
interview
lilly
hesitated
really
i
sha
keep
you
long
my
dear
i
understand
you
expecting
some
one
not
that
i
know
of
replied
lilly
aware
she
was
blushing
do
deny
it
salmoni
is
coming
i
know
the
joke
i
once
stood
the
same
way
pale
one
instant
the
next
instant
red
and
waited
for
him
the
only
difference
is
my
house
gown
was
such
an
angelic
red
i
was
plain
bordeaux
red
all
the
same
to
him
he
takes
us
in
bordeaux
red
too
what
do
you
mean
lilly
faltered
what
do
i
mean
do
you
know
what
our
circle
with
all
our
pretty
legères
women
is
to
salmoni
it
a
sort
of
fishing
pool
where
he
angles
from
time
to
time
to
land
something
for
which
he
just
then
happens
to
have
an
appetite
there
you
have
it
my
dear
that
slander
cried
lilly
flaring
up
he
never
made
approaches
to
me
we
never
so
much
as
mentioned
the
word
love
to
each
other
no
need
replied
jula
and
laughed
exultingly
he
does
bother
with
such
petty
things
he
knows
when
the
time
comes
we
shall
swim
into
his
net
without
it
lilly
felt
herself
getting
still
angrier
we
always
spoken
of
pure
noble
things
of
a
proud
humanity
and
if
you
and
your
like
can
not
understand
his
language
if
you
insist
one
moment
my
dear
jula
interrupted
her
no
need
to
be
insulting
i
came
to
you
out
of
good
motives
as
for
the
others
it
was
même
to
me
i
even
licked
my
chops
but
i
love
you
even
if
you
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
me
to
leave
as
you
are
and
last
night
when
i
saw
how
far
things
had
gone
i
could
quiet
down
i
had
to
come
to
you
before
he
really
you
mistaken
said
lilly
though
unable
to
refrain
from
a
furtive
glance
at
the
clock
jula
upon
whom
the
glance
was
not
lost
made
a
little
grimace
never
mind
when
the
bell
rings
i
slide
out
through
the
guest
room
but
before
then
i
am
in
hopes
of
having
completed
my
work
see
here
child
she
seated
herself
at
one
end
of
the
sofa
and
drew
lilly
down
beside
her
why
all
of
us
poor
women
crave
to
rise
again
or
once
did
when
like
you
we
were
tolerably
faithful
to
the
one
at
the
psychological
moment
enter
salmoni
he
does
have
to
work
so
hard
for
some
of
us
but
he
seems
to
like
it
he
must
first
salivate
on
us
like
an
adder
on
a
sparrow
he
has
various
methods
with
a
cold
mug
like
karla
of
course
he
behaves
very
differently
from
the
way
he
behaves
with
such
as
you
or
me
to
us
he
says
in
the
beginning
can
not
get
over
my
astonishment
at
seeing
you
in
these
surroundings
tell
me
what
seek
you
here
lilly
started
well
did
he
or
did
he
yes
but
very
well
yes
that
all
i
want
to
know
then
he
describes
the
dangers
threatening
us
provided
we
continue
to
live
in
chains
his
pet
abomination
is
duty
he
can
not
bear
it
as
if
we
were
so
awfully
particular
about
our
little
bit
of
duty
lordy
well
is
that
the
way
it
went
yes
but
stammered
lilly
good
then
will
deliver
us
will
guide
us
he
the
mountain
guide
ordained
up
to
the
heights
pas
lilly
turned
her
face
away
to
conceal
her
blush
of
shame
next
in
turn
come
the
books
miserable
palaver
written
by
immature
little
scribblers
in
imitation
of
the
great
nietzsche
nevertheless
we
all
fall
into
the
trap
it
gets
into
our
blood
like
spanish
fly
it
quite
befuddles
us
the
thing
that
so
infuriates
us
afterwards
is
that
we
actually
believed
in
the
scoundrel
woebegone
pathos
although
the
mangiest
cynicism
crops
out
of
every
pore
of
his
body
but
we
such
sheep
and
he
so
clever
so
clever
yes
he
is
clever
you
must
give
the
devil
his
due
but
how
does
he
manage
asked
lilly
who
no
longer
dared
to
shield
him
how
does
he
manage
to
make
it
appear
that
he
lived
through
our
entire
past
with
us
yes
child
people
in
similar
circumstances
usually
have
similar
experiences
he
can
easily
reconstruct
our
past
of
those
of
us
who
came
from
the
country
i
a
landed
proprietor
daughter
did
he
tell
you
in
a
that
he
had
passed
a
great
part
of
his
youth
in
castles
lilly
assented
later
i
learned
he
had
been
private
tutor
to
a
jew
living
on
a
leased
estate
near
breslau
but
they
bounced
him
pretty
soon
because
he
was
saucy
in
the
midst
of
her
sad
disenchantment
lilly
had
to
burst
out
laughing
fine
said
her
friend
in
approval
stroking
her
hands
you
may
well
feel
happy
i
wish
someone
had
come
to
me
the
same
way
because
afterwards
oh
how
it
hurts
yes
tell
me
how
is
it
afterwards
asked
lilly
hesitatingly
very
simple
after
he
gotten
what
he
wants
finis
he
buttons
up
his
coat
says
in
a
voice
quivering
with
emotion
but
there
never
is
a
you
never
see
him
again
impossible
cried
lilly
a
man
ca
treat
a
woman
so
currishly
you
see
him
i
tell
you
what
do
you
suppose
the
man
has
weightier
matters
to
attend
to
i
wrote
my
fingers
sore
not
a
line
in
reply
welter
lay
on
his
threshold
karla
got
the
jaundice
she
was
so
furious
and
so
on
but
his
name
is
eel
when
you
meet
him
later
in
company
you
do
read
the
faintest
recollection
in
his
eyes
at
the
very
most
he
you
like
the
rest
lilly
alarmed
brought
it
home
to
herself
that
she
too
had
later
encountered
a
conscience
in
company
and
had
forcibly
extinguished
every
recollection
no
matter
how
much
the
conscience
besought
her
with
his
comically
mournful
glances
one
person
behaved
like
the
other
in
this
world
where
you
threw
your
dignity
away
like
an
dress
she
hid
her
face
on
the
sofa
arm
shaken
with
a
storm
of
shame
and
guilt
never
mind
jula
comforted
her
nothing
has
happened
yet
the
bell
rang
lilly
hurried
to
the
kitchen
to
tell
the
maid
to
dismiss
the
visitor
but
jula
restrained
her
what
gotten
into
your
head
she
whispered
would
you
have
him
think
you
afraid
of
him
that
way
you
never
be
rid
of
him
laugh
at
him
do
you
understand
at
him
long
and
hard
lilly
wanted
to
run
after
her
and
beg
her
to
remain
was
she
lilly
his
match
he
was
already
entering
the
room
drawn
to
her
full
height
she
looked
at
him
as
at
a
dead
enemy
my
dear
child
he
said
kissing
her
hand
which
she
quickly
withdrew
he
had
exercised
great
care
in
dressing
he
wore
gloves
and
held
his
silk
hat
pressed
to
his
breast
his
monocle
danced
on
his
white
waistcoat
an
air
of
smug
of
unpretentious
mastery
enveloped
his
being
like
a
mild
glory
the
way
he
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
chair
the
way
he
amiably
crossed
his
legs
indicated
that
of
course
she
had
been
subjugated
lilly
was
no
longer
fearful
or
timid
nor
did
she
experience
the
pangs
of
disillusionment
she
was
simply
possessed
of
cool
conscious
curiosity
she
followed
each
of
his
movements
with
astonished
eyes
as
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
shining
hair
cut
brush
fashion
and
pulled
his
trousers
up
and
exposed
the
stockings
on
his
ankles
she
kept
saying
to
herself
so
what
you
are
what
you
are
he
began
to
speak
in
a
soft
compassionate
caressing
voice
while
his
peering
eyes
glided
up
and
down
her
body
you
excited
dear
child
i
understand
when
two
people
like
us
are
brought
alone
together
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
their
feelings
run
away
with
them
do
be
ashamed
what
led
us
to
each
other
is
such
a
delicate
subtle
understanding
the
fluid
between
us
is
of
such
a
rare
fleeting
quality
yes
fleeting
especially
thought
lilly
that
it
would
really
be
a
shame
if
we
did
not
taste
every
drop
of
it
and
a
superabundance
of
feelings
would
simply
be
a
hindrance
to
the
spiritual
epicureanism
in
both
of
us
particularly
in
me
as
he
spoke
slightly
smacking
his
lips
and
swaying
back
and
forth
the
refrain
of
a
viennese
ditty
in
her
repertoire
occurred
to
her
i
have
much
too
much
sentiment
he
has
much
too
much
sentiment
she
said
to
herself
and
smiled
involuntarily
he
saw
the
smile
which
she
tried
to
conceal
by
lowering
her
face
but
he
misinterpreted
it
there
is
a
coy
virginity
about
you
he
said
with
an
admiring
shake
of
his
head
which
always
fills
me
with
astonishment
oh
you
jackanapes
thought
lilly
and
smiled
again
now
he
hesitated
a
bit
he
had
not
had
all
his
experience
for
nothing
and
a
flash
of
greed
and
suspicion
darted
from
between
his
lids
oh
he
continued
has
some
of
the
delightful
humour
that
you
surprised
us
with
last
night
remained
over
for
perhaps
she
replied
with
an
upward
glance
which
was
almost
coquettish
oh
splendid
he
cried
his
face
now
brightened
into
a
mischievous
smile
in
which
gaiety
and
devilishness
counterbalanced
each
other
are
you
one
of
those
who
can
laugh
in
her
sleeve
at
at
how
shall
i
say
at
the
whole
humbuggery
of
it
all
and
at
yourself
at
yourself
my
child
that
the
main
thing
then
you
and
i
are
one
nothing
divides
us
then
may
god
forgive
me
she
thought
and
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
to
suppress
her
tittering
laugh
at
him
jula
had
said
but
he
seemed
to
take
it
as
an
invitation
as
a
delicate
friendly
hint
to
cut
the
preamble
short
for
he
sprang
toward
her
and
clasped
her
body
she
pushed
him
back
she
wrestled
with
him
tears
of
shame
and
indignation
welled
up
in
her
eyes
what
sort
of
a
thing
have
i
become
a
voice
within
her
cried
while
she
struck
at
him
with
her
fists
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
she
succeeded
in
reaching
the
bell
the
maid
appeared
he
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
carpet
murmured
something
like
riffraff
and
disappeared
disappeared
also
from
the
little
circle
that
he
had
sometimes
honoured
with
his
presence
henceforth
lilly
ceased
to
aspire
to
the
heights
chapter
xi
the
next
year
lilly
went
through
two
little
love
affairs
which
were
of
no
significance
in
her
after
life
during
a
four
weeks
stay
in
the
riesengebirge
she
met
a
novelist
whose
name
was
then
on
everybody
lips
he
was
airing
his
newly
acquired
fame
in
the
bohemian
resorts
and
plucking
what
flowers
he
found
by
the
roadside
he
forced
himself
upon
lilly
without
much
ceremony
and
a
few
days
later
went
his
way
in
search
of
pastures
new
and
in
berlin
she
favoured
a
handsome
extremely
elegant
hussar
of
the
guards
who
had
flirted
with
her
from
his
seat
at
the
next
table
in
an
aristocratic
restaurant
but
he
wounded
her
pride
by
attempting
to
repay
her
with
a
little
leather
box
which
came
from
the
jeweler
she
sent
back
the
box
and
turned
him
off
she
disliked
the
thought
of
both
adventures
and
soon
wiped
them
entirely
from
her
memory
at
christmas
a
companion
came
to
live
with
her
she
had
frequently
complained
to
richard
that
her
life
was
empty
she
craved
something
alive
and
loving
to
take
care
of
so
he
gave
her
a
little
naked
monkey
which
could
not
warm
itself
even
in
her
bosom
when
angry
the
monkey
spat
his
scorn
of
her
yearning
in
her
face
every
now
and
then
a
marriage
scheme
was
again
propounded
lilly
knew
the
signs
perfectly
when
richard
paced
through
all
the
rooms
taciturn
and
distraught
wrinkling
his
forehead
when
apropos
of
nothing
he
began
to
philosophise
on
the
futility
of
all
things
earthly
when
mama
required
the
carriage
at
unwonted
hours
and
little
packages
of
concert
and
opera
tickets
filled
his
purse
she
knew
something
was
impending
and
then
it
seldom
lasted
long
before
richard
broke
silence
one
had
two
millions
the
other
three
influential
relatives
mines
factories
legacies
government
contracts
whole
blocks
of
houses
and
innumerable
building
lots
nodded
in
the
distance
sometimes
lilly
hummed
with
so
many
figures
that
it
might
have
been
a
stockbroker
office
one
of
the
prospective
brides
even
was
poor
but
she
was
a
daughter
and
mama
adored
her
i
a
general
widow
said
lilly
whether
rich
or
poor
they
all
disappeared
because
none
of
them
was
good
enough
for
him
lilly
meditated
and
schemed
this
is
the
way
she
should
be
and
this
way
and
this
way
she
must
have
white
arms
such
as
the
danish
girl
at
the
carnival
and
she
must
have
an
extremely
delicate
scarcely
perceptible
bosom
her
own
seemed
to
lilly
to
have
become
too
voluptuous
and
when
she
laughed
two
dimples
must
form
in
her
cheeks
because
dimples
were
a
sign
of
peaceableness
peace
she
demanded
for
him
above
all
she
knew
he
could
not
bear
disputes
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
never
did
quarrel
but
if
a
little
disagreement
arose
he
went
about
for
days
looking
miserable
spoke
in
a
woebegone
sick
tone
and
had
to
be
petted
like
a
child
which
she
did
with
joy
though
he
by
no
means
deserved
it
for
whatever
the
standpoint
from
which
you
viewed
such
things
he
had
become
an
out
and
out
he
might
be
pardoned
the
very
respectable
sums
he
lost
at
the
club
but
he
debauched
like
a
married
man
and
his
experiences
were
none
of
the
purest
one
day
a
pretty
young
thing
with
an
eight
weeks
old
baby
on
her
arm
came
to
lilly
and
wept
and
screamed
and
declared
lilly
must
cede
her
place
to
her
because
she
had
the
child
by
him
and
so
the
greater
right
lilly
comforted
her
and
gave
her
some
wine
and
filled
with
envy
tickled
the
baby
wet
little
chin
until
it
laughed
whereupon
the
girl
left
quieted
and
even
kissed
lilly
hand
on
parting
that
afternoon
richard
listened
to
an
eloquent
discourse
lilly
felt
herself
to
be
entirely
free
from
jealousy
whenever
he
appeared
looking
embarrassed
or
with
a
crafty
expression
in
his
eyes
his
head
inclined
all
the
way
to
the
left
and
radiating
an
odour
of
cheap
perfumes
she
always
received
him
with
an
indulgent
smile
which
he
understood
very
well
and
feared
like
a
plague
however
valiant
his
resolve
to
maintain
silence
it
scarcely
lasted
half
an
hour
before
he
sat
there
hopelessly
stranded
making
partly
veiled
confessions
and
asking
for
praise
and
comfort
in
a
life
of
this
sort
which
reflected
all
the
faults
and
perfidies
of
marriage
without
bestowing
its
sense
of
dignity
and
natural
rights
it
was
inevitable
that
lilly
should
withdraw
into
herself
more
and
more
and
look
forward
to
her
future
with
increasing
gloom
she
passed
her
days
as
on
a
swaying
bough
in
momentary
expectation
of
being
blown
into
the
depths
then
again
her
life
seemed
to
her
like
a
straight
bare
road
which
gave
no
signs
of
coming
to
an
end
but
ever
unrolled
hopeless
stretches
ahead
always
the
same
pleasures
the
same
faces
the
same
aimless
drifting
from
place
to
place
until
dawn
sometimes
she
felt
so
weary
as
if
after
a
day
hard
labour
sometimes
too
she
went
on
strike
and
remained
in
bed
reading
the
or
dreaming
of
old
times
with
closed
eyes
asmussen
sunless
hole
among
the
books
became
a
paradise
her
mush
food
for
the
gods
lilly
thoughts
stepped
cautiously
about
the
pictures
of
her
girlhood
loves
as
if
it
were
a
crime
to
charm
them
back
into
being
from
this
arose
a
happy
yet
fearful
presentiment
that
one
or
the
other
of
them
would
return
and
hold
out
his
hand
and
say
now
you
have
strayed
in
strange
lands
long
enough
come
back
home
which
of
them
it
was
she
did
not
venture
to
say
but
one
of
them
it
must
be
something
something
happen
it
could
go
on
the
same
way
now
and
then
when
her
secret
disquiet
filled
her
with
unrest
she
took
again
to
her
nocturnal
strolls
in
the
electric
tram
she
would
ride
to
distant
districts
where
with
a
guilty
soul
she
sauntered
along
lively
streets
just
like
jula
yet
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
listen
to
any
of
her
pursuers
it
was
on
one
such
excursion
in
may
far
out
on
the
north
side
somewhere
near
the
rosentaler
tor
that
she
met
a
young
man
who
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
her
who
did
not
look
like
a
gentleman
and
yet
seemed
familiar
so
familiar
that
her
heart
pained
her
she
racked
her
brain
but
could
not
place
him
making
up
her
mind
quickly
she
turned
about
and
followed
him
he
wore
a
brown
hat
and
a
salt
and
pepper
suit
with
a
yellow
tinge
to
it
which
had
seen
better
days
his
coat
collar
was
shiny
and
his
knees
had
worked
great
bags
into
his
trousers
the
bottom
of
which
hung
in
black
fringes
over
his
crooked
heels
none
of
her
friends
in
disguise
her
friends
wore
different
trousers
he
stopped
in
front
of
various
display
windows
a
cigar
shop
a
butcher
and
longest
of
all
a
haberdasher
from
which
lilly
concluded
his
undergarments
also
required
a
change
when
he
turned
his
profile
toward
her
she
saw
a
lean
bony
face
with
a
prominent
nose
and
a
bush
of
hair
on
either
side
of
his
chin
he
did
not
appear
to
be
sickly
rather
seedy
or
withered
but
the
lids
of
his
small
eyes
were
swollen
and
inflamed
and
before
he
stepped
into
the
garish
illumination
of
the
shop
window
he
planted
goggles
on
his
nose
he
carried
a
thin
cane
which
he
pressed
into
the
shape
of
a
bow
on
the
pavement
and
then
let
shoot
out
straight
again
the
silver
handle
of
this
cane
which
did
not
harmonise
with
the
shabbiness
of
his
clothing
recalled
something
to
lilly
connected
with
chilliness
warm
rolls
autumnal
glow
and
sunday
chimes
she
cried
aloud
now
she
remembered
fritz
redlich
yes
it
was
fritz
redlich
no
doubt
of
it
her
girlhood
love
her
girlhood
love
her
great
warrior
in
life
battles
her
joseph
protégé
oh
god
her
joseph
and
the
revolver
and
the
potato
soup
with
sliced
sausage
and
the
three
graves
at
ottensen
redlich
mr
redlich
trembling
laughing
she
stood
behind
him
and
stretched
out
both
hands
he
dropped
his
goggles
and
blinking
his
weak
eyes
suspiciously
scrutinised
the
tall
elegant
lady
from
behind
whose
lace
veil
two
great
eyes
were
shining
a
blissful
greeting
then
he
awkwardly
pulled
at
the
brim
of
his
hat
redlich
i
lilly
lilly
czepanek
do
you
remember
me
any
more
yes
now
he
remembered
certainly
he
said
why
should
i
as
he
spoke
he
gave
a
furtive
jerk
at
his
waistcoat
as
if
that
were
the
readiest
way
of
improving
the
poverty
of
his
appearance
dear
me
redlich
we
have
seen
each
other
for
an
eternity
i
think
it
must
be
seven
or
eight
years
no
not
quite
but
it
seems
much
longer
everything
gone
well
with
you
in
the
meantime
has
it
and
i
suppose
you
dreadfully
busy
but
if
you
not
we
might
spend
a
little
time
together
now
he
really
was
quite
busy
but
if
she
so
desired
they
might
remain
together
a
while
how
would
it
be
if
we
went
to
a
restaurant
and
took
a
glass
of
beer
she
suggested
still
between
laughter
and
tears
well
well
redlich
who
have
thought
it
possible
he
was
decidedly
opposed
to
taking
a
glass
of
beer
restaurants
are
always
so
stuffy
and
full
of
people
and
the
beer
here
is
so
wretched
unfit
to
drink
the
poor
fellow
has
no
money
to
pay
for
it
lilly
thought
and
proposed
sitting
on
a
bench
instead
it
made
no
difference
just
so
they
were
together
that
worth
considering
he
said
although
he
looked
about
warily
on
all
sides
to
see
if
anyone
was
scandalised
at
the
couple
they
turned
into
the
quieter
weinbersgsweg
lilly
looking
at
him
sidewise
with
pride
and
emotion
as
if
she
had
created
him
out
of
nothingness
kept
murmuring
is
it
possible
is
it
possible
in
a
dark
spot
near
a
church
they
found
a
pleasant
bench
overhung
with
lilac
buds
which
a
love
couple
had
just
vacated
well
now
tell
me
all
about
yourself
redlich
my
the
things
we
have
to
say
to
each
other
there
a
good
deal
to
tell
he
replied
hesitating
but
perhaps
my
lady
will
begin
oh
pshaw
i
have
been
a
lady
for
a
long
time
cried
lilly
blushing
consciously
yes
to
be
sure
i
heard
something
of
the
sort
he
replied
lilly
felt
there
was
a
note
of
blame
in
his
tone
as
if
his
susceptibilities
had
been
offended
but
i
not
in
the
least
sorry
she
hastened
to
add
all
in
all
i
lead
a
much
freer
and
pleasanter
life
and
i
have
the
slightest
cares
i
have
a
charming
little
home
in
fact
i
in
the
best
of
circumstances
and
i
be
ever
so
happy
if
you
were
to
come
and
see
for
yourself
i
always
at
home
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
i
like
you
to
dine
with
me
some
time
oh
he
said
obviously
moved
by
the
pleasant
prospect
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
at
having
steered
so
smoothly
past
the
rocks
of
her
autobiography
and
he
asked
no
questions
on
the
other
hand
he
seemed
as
little
disposed
to
be
communicative
in
regard
to
his
own
situation
past
or
present
life
has
a
sunny
and
a
shady
side
he
said
and
he
who
sits
on
the
shady
side
would
do
well
to
reflect
whether
or
not
he
should
speak
much
of
it
but
you
can
trust
an
old
friend
like
me
cried
lilly
imagine
sitting
here
on
our
porch
in
junkerstrasse
do
you
recollect
that
evening
we
spoke
to
each
other
the
first
time
was
an
evening
just
like
this
in
may
it
was
warmer
he
rejoined
quickly
and
drew
his
coat
together
at
his
neck
are
you
chilly
she
asked
laughing
because
she
was
aglow
i
did
bring
he
paused
an
instant
i
did
bring
my
spring
overcoat
along
then
we
better
get
up
she
said
becoming
meditative
we
can
tell
each
other
all
we
have
to
say
just
as
well
walking
as
sitting
so
they
strolled
about
the
dark
church
a
number
of
times
but
no
autobiographical
narrative
resulted
she
evaded
and
he
evaded
and
when
forced
to
speak
they
regaled
each
other
with
generalities
lilly
praised
her
happy
lot
in
life
and
he
sighed
repeatedly
yes
it
hard
very
hard
exactly
as
once
during
examinations
the
rhythm
of
it
still
sounded
in
her
ears
as
if
she
had
heard
it
the
day
before
how
are
your
father
and
mother
she
asked
to
change
the
subject
his
father
had
died
two
years
before
after
a
short
sickness
and
his
mother
still
sewed
neckties
he
adjusted
something
invisible
under
his
raised
coat
collar
probably
a
gayly
patterned
testimony
of
maternal
skill
and
goodness
after
lilly
had
expressed
her
sympathy
she
ventured
with
throbbing
heart
to
inquire
after
asmussen
and
her
daughters
redlich
smacked
his
lips
audibly
very
unpleasant
neighbours
the
elder
girl
married
a
paymaster
who
will
probably
be
dismissed
soon
on
account
of
his
irregularities
the
younger
has
charge
of
the
library
the
mother
is
completely
in
the
clutches
of
drink
he
spoke
with
the
same
offended
air
as
when
lilly
had
referred
to
her
divorce
he
must
be
extremely
moral
still
she
thought
with
a
sense
of
her
own
guilt
and
unworthiness
but
he
was
unhappy
that
was
certain
and
poor
very
poor
poorer
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
perhaps
he
was
suffering
the
pangs
of
hunger
while
he
walked
at
her
side
shivering
in
his
thin
shabby
jacket
how
would
it
be
redlich
provided
your
business
permits
you
to
if
you
were
to
come
to
dinner
his
business
as
a
matter
of
fact
made
it
practically
impossible
for
him
to
get
off
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
he
had
a
moment
time
for
changing
his
clothes
but
if
she
would
receive
him
in
the
suit
he
was
wearing
oh
of
course
she
laughed
i
even
serve
you
with
your
potato
soup
with
that
she
pressed
both
his
hands
and
slipped
into
a
street
car
oh
what
a
piece
of
good
fortune
now
she
had
the
thing
she
had
so
long
been
seeking
some
one
whom
she
could
care
for
and
pet
and
spoil
some
one
to
whom
she
meant
more
than
a
toy
or
a
show
piece
who
needed
her
as
he
needed
bread
and
air
who
languished
for
a
gentle
hand
to
lead
him
back
to
hope
and
joy
some
one
all
to
herself
all
to
herself
out
of
the
grave
of
her
youth
he
had
risen
exactly
as
she
had
dreamed
in
her
dreams
life
would
again
become
rich
and
happy
and
full
of
secrets
tiny
gay
absolutely
innocent
secrets
that
night
she
slept
little
wakeful
as
a
child
the
night
before
christmas
the
next
morning
to
the
vast
astonishment
of
the
maid
a
buxom
wench
from
the
country
who
had
rapidly
fallen
into
city
ways
lilly
rose
early
the
maid
knew
her
to
be
a
bit
lazy
and
went
off
to
market
a
friend
is
coming
to
dinner
lilly
laughingly
explained
she
had
to
buy
everything
herself
the
meat
the
radishes
and
above
all
the
sausage
that
had
once
been
the
pride
of
his
mother
potato
soup
she
even
attended
to
the
cooking
herself
she
set
the
table
and
removed
the
palm
from
beside
the
aquarium
to
have
something
green
in
the
in
place
of
flowers
which
she
had
forgotten
to
buy
he
was
the
first
dinner
guest
she
had
had
for
two
and
a
half
years
and
such
a
dear
one
the
dearest
perhaps
that
life
could
present
her
with
at
half
past
twelve
the
maid
turning
up
her
nose
announced
a
young
fellow
who
insisted
upon
speaking
to
the
lady
why
that
he
cried
lilly
he
does
look
it
observed
the
maid
with
a
haughty
upward
inflection
in
her
voice
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
dawdled
behind
her
mistress
who
ran
to
meet
the
guest
at
first
he
shyly
hesitated
to
step
into
the
lighter
part
of
the
room
and
hugged
the
door
post
and
pulled
at
his
suit
which
really
looked
dreadfully
frayed
even
more
so
than
the
night
before
his
inflamed
eyes
two
red
rifts
blinking
behind
his
round
glasses
gave
him
a
sheepish
groping
helpless
appearance
the
bold
forehead
had
acquired
an
unpleasant
backward
slope
because
the
genius
lock
no
longer
fell
over
it
and
the
triumphant
blond
mane
had
turned
into
a
strawy
matted
mass
apparently
untouched
by
a
comb
this
many
a
day
he
was
unable
to
say
much
he
swallowed
the
potato
soup
with
tremulous
devoutness
leaving
the
slices
of
sausage
for
the
last
when
his
plate
was
quite
dry
he
spitted
them
on
his
fork
one
at
a
time
and
on
conveying
each
bit
to
his
mouth
cast
suspicious
glances
to
right
and
left
as
if
somebody
were
standing
nearby
to
snatch
it
away
the
roast
he
received
with
greater
composure
he
heaped
his
plate
high
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
the
maid
who
grinned
villainously
he
drank
richard
good
claret
in
long
draughts
a
mottled
red
flecked
his
cheeks
he
laughed
and
felt
he
was
himself
again
at
first
lilly
had
been
somewhat
depressed
but
as
he
gradually
thawed
out
she
began
to
hope
he
might
be
made
to
pass
muster
after
all
then
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
that
now
at
last
an
opportunity
presented
itself
for
the
genuine
salvation
of
a
human
being
not
merely
a
game
of
enamoured
as
with
walter
von
prell
the
thought
filled
her
with
blissful
confident
hope
after
the
meal
they
went
into
the
with
masterful
ease
of
manner
born
of
the
unwonted
drink
he
promptly
seated
himself
in
the
rocking
chair
and
tickled
the
snarling
monkey
he
sat
leaning
back
in
the
chair
with
his
legs
stretched
out
the
fringed
ends
of
his
trousers
slipped
into
the
expanded
tops
of
his
boots
exposing
the
tattered
rubber
drawing
loops
it
was
an
appalling
sight
i
have
to
do
something
thought
lilly
and
cogitated
on
the
best
way
to
help
him
as
for
redlich
now
that
his
spirits
were
in
turmoil
he
turned
his
innermost
being
outward
and
aired
his
views
of
life
oh
what
a
display
of
gall
and
poison
he
had
become
so
embittered
by
long
privation
and
eternal
envy
of
those
who
seemed
gay
happy
and
favoured
by
fortune
that
no
values
no
attainments
no
prosperous
undertakings
could
withstand
his
onslaught
everybody
was
hollow
corrupt
and
hypocritical
everything
depended
on
birth
cliqueism
pull
success
no
matter
in
what
line
was
an
ineradicable
stain
but
this
time
also
he
said
little
of
his
personal
experiences
lilly
could
not
even
discover
if
he
was
still
a
student
he
acknowledged
only
one
thing
with
bitter
resentment
that
his
deepest
feelings
had
been
badly
damaged
in
his
constant
struggle
for
existence
while
he
spoke
and
laughed
spasmodically
two
lugubrious
sarcastic
folds
cut
a
deep
semicircle
in
each
emaciated
cheek
lilly
dimly
recalled
that
a
tendency
to
those
folds
had
existed
in
the
times
long
ago
oh
you
poor
poor
fellow
she
thought
and
vowed
soon
to
make
a
man
of
him
again
both
outwardly
and
inwardly
but
his
visit
left
her
feeling
sad
and
depressed
after
all
am
i
better
off
she
thought
where
is
the
confidence
in
life
i
used
to
have
where
is
my
joy
of
life
where
is
my
song
of
songs
the
next
afternoon
before
richard
came
she
devised
a
plan
by
which
she
could
give
fritz
redlich
new
clothes
without
damage
to
purse
or
fritz
redlich
feelings
think
of
it
she
said
to
richard
while
they
were
drinking
tea
together
two
great
events
occurred
to
me
yesterday
one
a
very
happy
one
the
other
very
sad
the
first
is
i
met
a
dear
old
friend
i
used
to
know
when
i
was
a
girl
before
he
went
to
the
university
he
lived
on
the
same
floor
as
i
did
and
this
morning
a
poor
student
was
here
he
looked
simply
wretched
and
he
asked
for
something
to
eat
in
case
he
comes
again
have
you
any
old
clothes
to
give
him
no
matter
what
he
needs
everything
with
pleasure
said
richard
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
all
the
stuff
i
have
at
any
rate
but
the
other
one
the
friend
of
her
girlhood
made
richard
thoughtful
what
he
like
he
asked
in
her
endeavour
to
keep
the
two
mythical
beings
quite
distinct
she
began
to
sing
the
other
one
praises
much
too
emphatically
he
was
a
highly
endowed
and
quite
prominent
scholar
who
had
just
completed
his
university
course
and
now
stood
at
the
entrance
to
a
brilliant
career
a
paragon
of
knowledge
and
intellect
and
heaven
knows
what
else
what
was
his
specialty
she
really
did
not
know
something
awfully
erudite
at
any
rate
and
he
would
surely
choose
an
academic
career
nothing
else
was
worth
while
for
him
lilly
talked
herself
into
such
a
tangle
of
lies
that
finally
she
scarcely
knew
what
she
was
saying
richard
who
in
the
consciousness
of
his
intellectual
poverty
felt
a
tremendous
respect
for
a
great
mind
grew
red
in
the
face
and
looked
uneasy
and
nettled
i
suppose
he
be
wanting
to
visit
you
he
asked
certainly
she
replied
rejoiced
at
having
steered
in
this
direction
so
smoothly
congratulate
you
on
your
affinity
he
said
with
a
mocking
bow
and
added
laughing
provided
i
need
meet
him
perfect
the
next
morning
a
man
employed
in
the
factory
brought
lilly
a
huge
bundle
from
dehnicke
it
contained
a
fine
summer
suit
in
the
latest
style
looking
almost
new
shirts
a
pair
of
boots
and
blue
silky
underwear
richard
seemed
to
want
to
prove
his
magnanimity
in
a
particularly
striking
way
because
prodigality
toward
the
poor
was
not
in
his
line
the
next
difficulty
was
to
turn
the
garments
over
to
fritz
redlich
without
offending
him
and
having
him
refuse
them
when
he
visited
her
three
days
later
she
took
occasion
after
dinner
to
show
him
through
the
rooms
he
must
see
how
she
lived
she
said
when
she
came
to
the
door
of
a
lumber
room
she
opened
it
quite
naturally
as
she
had
the
others
there
among
discarded
waists
broken
vases
withered
plants
and
similar
litter
hung
the
suit
i
brought
it
along
by
mistake
and
some
more
men
clothes
when
i
left
the
general
house
she
explained
it
getting
worn
just
hanging
here
redlich
small
sickly
eyes
became
bright
and
greedy
perhaps
he
knew
some
one
who
could
make
use
of
them
not
that
i
know
of
he
replied
disdainfully
though
unable
to
withhold
a
glance
at
his
own
trousers
perhaps
he
had
met
some
one
to
whom
he
would
be
doing
a
favour
if
he
gave
him
the
suit
no
he
could
think
of
no
one
despite
her
fear
of
hurting
him
lilly
said
straight
out
she
believe
she
was
mistaken
a
remarkable
similarity
of
figure
though
the
general
had
measured
a
bit
more
about
the
waist
and
if
he
wanted
to
entrust
the
suit
to
an
inexpensive
tailor
the
suggestion
angered
him
did
she
think
he
was
a
charity
case
nobody
could
class
him
so
low
as
that
he
was
a
man
of
firm
principles
and
his
principles
would
never
permit
him
to
wear
a
person
clothes
with
a
sigh
lilly
desisted
from
her
project
but
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
take
leave
he
sat
in
the
an
interminable
time
finally
she
had
to
hint
to
him
to
go
because
richard
might
enter
any
moment
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
outside
her
door
he
turned
and
asked
stuttering
whether
the
next
time
he
might
come
in
the
evening
have
you
leisure
any
more
in
the
middle
of
the
day
she
demanded
taken
aback
for
richard
sake
she
did
not
care
to
receive
visitors
late
in
the
day
no
not
that
so
far
as
leisure
was
concerned
it
was
it
was
he
hung
on
and
lilly
listened
fearfully
for
sounds
on
the
staircase
below
then
what
is
it
i
should
like
to
think
the
matter
over
very
carefully
and
and
well
and
and
if
it
dark
perhaps
i
could
take
the
package
right
along
with
me
with
that
he
jumped
down
the
steps
the
poor
fellow
how
he
must
choke
down
his
pride
she
thought
looking
after
him
the
same
evening
she
sent
him
all
the
clothes
by
express
and
pinned
a
letter
inside
in
which
she
excused
herself
again
and
again
for
enclosing
a
twenty
mark
note
in
the
first
place
for
a
hat
in
the
second
place
to
spare
him
difficulties
with
the
tailor
when
he
reappeared
a
few
days
later
he
was
scarcely
recognisable
the
suit
fitted
him
to
perfection
and
in
order
to
keep
the
tips
of
his
boots
from
turning
up
they
were
too
long
for
him
he
had
stuffed
them
with
cotton
wads
even
the
maid
sent
him
friendlier
glances
a
pity
he
would
not
part
with
his
beard
and
the
tousled
shock
of
hair
but
for
that
disfigurement
you
might
even
appear
on
the
street
with
him
his
cheeks
had
filled
out
and
his
eyes
had
improved
thanks
to
the
help
of
the
physician
to
whom
lilly
had
dragged
him
by
main
force
and
gradually
his
manners
softened
down
he
no
longer
gulped
his
food
or
picked
his
teeth
with
his
finger
nails
and
he
learned
how
to
drink
claret
his
inner
being
like
his
external
appearance
also
began
to
reflect
the
peaceful
comfort
of
the
hospitable
home
he
abused
with
discrimination
and
sometimes
even
the
crime
of
happiness
seemed
pardonable
in
his
eyes
he
displayed
delightful
tact
in
never
probing
into
lilly
situation
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
although
she
avoided
questioning
him
as
to
his
own
doings
occasional
allusions
and
complaints
of
his
enabled
her
to
piece
together
a
picture
of
his
unsuccessful
career
after
two
years
of
starvation
he
gave
up
the
teaching
profession
and
consciously
sacrificing
his
convictions
took
up
the
study
of
theology
in
his
native
city
for
the
sake
of
one
or
two
scholarships
after
all
thought
lilly
deeply
stirred
she
recalled
the
red
sunny
morning
when
the
sunday
chimes
sent
up
their
greeting
from
out
of
the
green
valley
but
his
supreme
sacrifice
seemed
to
have
done
no
permanent
good
during
the
last
year
he
had
kept
himself
alive
by
occasionally
addressing
envelopes
and
in
other
mysterious
ways
concerning
which
he
was
not
explicit
nevertheless
he
said
i
maintained
my
dignity
and
even
if
i
am
poor
and
despised
i
know
my
worth
indeed
i
do
he
paced
the
room
fiery
and
lowering
when
he
threw
out
his
chest
and
ran
his
hand
through
his
mane
he
almost
resembled
the
young
hero
who
had
once
filled
lilly
enthusiastic
fancy
with
pictures
of
inordinate
ambition
to
complete
her
work
and
lead
him
entirely
back
to
happiness
she
tried
to
find
out
what
lot
in
life
he
desired
for
himself
he
wanted
to
go
away
leave
berlin
he
wanted
to
feel
himself
a
man
again
who
does
his
duty
and
knows
where
he
belongs
and
is
permitted
to
breathe
pure
air
all
of
us
want
something
lovely
like
that
she
thought
it
would
have
to
be
a
tutorship
in
a
family
anywhere
in
the
country
preferably
with
a
minister
of
whose
library
he
could
avail
himself
and
round
about
the
linden
trees
will
bloom
thought
lilly
and
the
wheat
will
wave
in
the
breeze
and
the
cattle
will
wind
their
way
to
water
she
nearly
cried
with
envy
from
that
day
on
she
worked
industriously
to
satisfy
his
heart
desire
she
gave
him
money
to
insert
advertisements
in
the
wrote
letters
herself
in
reply
to
all
sorts
of
offers
and
asked
her
little
circle
of
friends
to
do
what
they
could
for
him
all
these
transactions
had
to
be
carried
on
in
secret
to
avoid
attracting
richard
attention
even
so
she
had
much
to
suffer
from
him
these
days
he
found
her
wanting
in
attentiveness
to
him
he
rebuked
her
for
being
cold
and
loveless
and
detected
a
hostile
influence
in
her
every
word
that
probably
what
your
intellectual
friend
says
you
should
ask
your
brilliant
scholar
thus
it
went
without
cease
one
day
the
bomb
exploded
despite
his
promise
to
have
the
maid
announce
him
when
strangers
were
present
richard
stepped
into
the
while
lilly
was
at
table
with
her
girlhood
friend
he
had
neither
rung
nor
knocked
and
a
frown
of
revenge
puckered
his
brow
lilly
jumped
from
her
seat
paling
as
if
caught
in
guilt
fritz
redlich
also
jumped
up
he
stood
there
awkward
and
sheepish
while
the
corner
of
his
napkin
slowly
glided
from
his
buttonhole
into
his
soup
plate
for
a
moment
silence
prevailed
nothing
but
the
tittering
of
the
maid
in
the
kitchen
was
to
be
heard
i
beg
pardon
said
richard
in
the
same
threatening
manner
i
merely
wanted
to
make
sure
how
you
are
really
getting
along
dehnicke
a
good
friend
of
mine
redlich
my
old
friend
said
lilly
now
richard
scrutinised
his
dread
rival
more
closely
looked
in
amazement
and
disapproval
at
the
rank
growth
of
his
beard
and
shaggy
mane
his
gaze
travelled
downwards
and
brightened
a
nonplussed
look
but
also
a
joyous
look
of
recognition
betrayed
itself
in
his
features
was
that
suit
and
shirt
his
eyes
dropped
lower
without
halting
at
the
napkin
in
the
soup
plate
were
those
trousers
were
those
discarded
boots
which
the
brilliant
intellectual
scholar
was
wearing
oh
that
it
he
said
nothing
more
with
a
wicked
grin
of
scorn
he
turned
to
lilly
who
could
scarcely
keep
on
her
feet
may
i
speak
to
you
alone
for
an
instant
will
you
excuse
me
mr
redlich
she
said
and
in
her
confusion
and
from
force
of
habit
she
opened
the
door
to
the
bedroom
as
if
that
were
the
prescribed
place
for
single
ladies
to
receive
their
gentlemen
friends
richard
who
was
as
accustomed
to
the
way
as
she
followed
her
unconscious
of
the
exposure
of
intimacy
listen
he
said
upon
shutting
the
door
i
was
a
donkey
for
having
been
jealous
of
your
affinity
but
now
i
swear
to
you
your
friends
may
come
and
go
morning
or
evening
any
time
you
wish
i
always
keep
old
suits
on
hand
for
them
goosie
he
left
she
could
hear
him
laughing
even
after
the
door
fell
shut
behind
him
she
was
frightfully
ashamed
how
would
she
ever
summon
the
courage
to
appear
before
her
girlhood
friend
again
before
that
moral
person
who
had
shrunk
at
the
mere
mention
of
her
divorce
then
she
realised
she
was
standing
in
the
bedroom
everything
was
revealed
all
the
disgrace
of
her
existence
all
all
no
matter
how
unworldly
he
might
be
the
rôle
of
the
man
who
had
so
suddenly
intruded
in
the
apartment
and
as
suddenly
disappeared
must
be
patent
a
long
time
she
hesitated
the
knob
in
her
hand
listening
to
what
fritz
redlich
was
doing
she
feared
his
tread
the
clearing
of
his
throat
his
very
silence
boded
evil
at
last
trembling
ready
to
confess
everything
amid
tears
of
contrition
she
stepped
into
the
lo
and
behold
he
sat
quietly
at
his
accustomed
place
rubbing
at
the
spot
the
wet
napkin
had
made
on
his
waistcoat
the
blue
goggles
lay
next
to
his
plate
and
he
blinked
at
her
amiably
with
no
air
of
constraint
has
the
gentleman
left
already
he
asked
innocently
at
that
moment
the
roast
was
brought
in
and
he
fell
to
with
avidity
making
no
further
mention
of
the
interlude
actually
so
pure
was
his
conscience
that
he
did
not
detect
the
impure
even
if
thrust
under
his
very
nose
oh
how
grateful
she
was
to
him
to
prove
her
gratitude
she
told
him
he
might
come
evenings
also
richard
permitted
it
without
waiting
to
be
invited
if
she
should
happen
to
be
out
the
maid
would
prepare
supper
for
him
and
see
to
it
that
he
lacked
nothing
absolutely
nothing
and
mindful
of
the
wry
face
the
maid
had
cut
the
first
day
he
came
she
enjoined
her
emphatically
now
be
real
pleasant
and
friendly
to
him
so
that
he
always
feels
at
home
here
the
buxom
wench
turned
down
the
corners
of
her
mouth
and
said
nothing
lilly
now
went
to
work
in
behalf
of
fritz
redlich
with
redoubled
zeal
she
again
found
a
ready
assistant
in
jula
leave
the
thing
to
me
said
jula
one
day
there
somebody
up
there
i
known
a
long
time
she
hesitated
a
bit
he
and
has
taken
the
good
lord
place
in
many
a
minister
family
if
i
were
to
write
to
him
but
of
course
my
name
must
be
kept
out
still
a
red
rag
to
the
bull
up
there
the
next
day
lilly
sent
her
one
of
the
advertisements
that
fritz
redlich
had
inserted
in
the
paper
jula
was
to
forward
it
to
a
certain
person
and
the
response
would
then
go
directly
to
fritz
redlich
without
the
intermediation
of
a
third
party
lilly
preferred
that
his
future
fortune
should
appear
to
be
due
entirely
to
his
own
efforts
and
behold
jula
was
successful
one
evening
the
next
week
fritz
redlich
appeared
at
unexpectedly
a
frequent
occurrence
now
whether
she
was
at
home
or
not
and
complacently
informed
her
his
advertisement
had
been
so
convincing
that
he
had
immediately
received
an
invitation
from
a
minister
in
further
pomerania
to
send
his
references
and
be
ready
to
leave
berlin
at
short
notice
the
minister
seemed
to
be
quite
keen
for
him
lilly
heart
throbbed
with
pride
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
her
to
betray
that
she
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
good
luck
his
happiness
was
her
work
he
himself
therefore
was
her
possession
more
absolutely
her
possession
than
anything
in
the
world
during
the
meal
an
exalted
blissful
silence
prevailed
since
he
had
not
announced
his
coming
there
was
no
potato
soup
the
usual
first
course
she
excused
herself
for
the
omission
and
added
with
a
little
pang
at
any
rate
you
wo
take
many
more
meals
with
me
probably
he
said
with
an
embarrassed
glance
at
the
maid
whose
presence
evidently
troubled
him
had
she
not
been
there
he
would
very
likely
have
given
warmer
expression
to
his
feelings
after
the
meal
they
seated
themselves
in
the
it
was
july
and
a
hot
breeze
blew
through
the
open
windows
but
the
naked
little
monkey
whose
cage
stood
next
to
the
aquarium
shivered
even
at
this
season
and
had
to
be
wrapped
in
a
cloak
an
attention
to
which
he
submitted
snarling
all
the
while
the
canary
sang
its
evening
song
and
twilight
fell
fritz
redlich
sat
in
the
rocking
chair
in
which
he
liked
to
lounge
after
a
meal
lilly
walked
up
and
down
the
room
agitatedly
now
i
be
lonely
again
she
thought
and
i
fling
myself
about
as
before
yet
what
a
piece
of
good
fortune
it
had
been
what
good
fortune
she
told
him
so
for
about
the
hundredth
time
yes
he
rejoined
what
i
managed
to
achieve
here
through
my
struggles
is
really
a
piece
of
good
fortune
he
emphasised
my
struggles
when
i
think
what
dreadful
years
those
were
how
often
i
had
to
do
violence
to
my
real
character
how
often
my
principles
were
endangered
and
not
only
that
he
added
after
a
melancholy
pause
if
one
considers
the
doubtful
impure
situations
into
which
life
throws
one
it
is
really
no
wonder
that
one
is
infected
with
the
prevailing
spirit
and
commits
acts
one
would
rather
have
left
undone
i
tell
you
czepanek
it
hard
very
hard
oh
do
always
call
me
czepanek
say
lilly
right
straight
out
we
old
friends
i
will
gladly
if
you
wish
it
lilly
felt
a
tenderness
for
him
such
as
she
had
not
experienced
since
her
days
in
the
library
yet
it
was
different
from
then
it
was
a
motherly
sisterly
tenderness
no
not
exactly
that
either
it
was
a
bit
of
everything
and
something
in
addition
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
hesitatingly
like
a
light
in
the
distance
tell
me
something
fritz
she
said
standing
in
front
of
him
have
you
ever
been
in
love
he
started
as
if
he
had
been
hit
in
love
what
do
you
mean
well
what
do
you
think
i
mean
she
laughed
scratching
the
arm
of
the
rocking
chair
with
her
thumb
nail
he
seemed
to
breathe
more
easily
for
that
which
one
calls
real
love
i
never
had
the
time
or
the
desire
and
has
any
woman
ever
loved
you
do
i
look
as
if
a
woman
could
love
me
he
rejoined
shrugging
his
shoulders
his
embittered
dejection
annoyed
her
well
well
she
said
shaking
her
finger
to
comfort
him
with
a
little
teasing
he
started
again
as
if
the
mere
thought
of
such
a
possibility
filled
him
with
dread
poor
fellow
a
girl
eyes
had
never
sought
his
in
a
glow
a
woman
arm
had
never
clasped
his
neck
in
bliss
he
had
been
denied
the
supreme
delight
that
makes
life
worth
the
while
both
for
man
and
woman
an
avowal
burnt
on
her
lips
drifting
down
from
times
long
long
ago
which
would
prove
to
him
how
mistaken
he
was
she
choked
it
down
not
later
perhaps
when
he
came
to
say
before
leaving
berlin
darkness
fell
and
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
played
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
monkey
had
rolled
himself
into
a
ball
in
his
cloak
and
the
little
canary
also
slept
lilly
still
paced
to
and
fro
gently
grazing
his
elbow
each
time
she
passed
the
rocking
chair
she
halted
in
front
of
him
again
there
he
sat
he
whom
she
had
once
loved
so
hotly
and
suspected
nothing
suspected
nothing
of
what
women
arms
could
bestow
poor
poor
fellow
you
must
really
have
that
shock
of
hair
of
yours
trimmed
she
said
with
a
constrained
laugh
then
you
succeed
better
with
the
women
with
difficulty
as
if
she
were
drawing
up
a
hundred
pound
weight
lilly
raised
her
left
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
hard
crisp
hair
which
sank
under
the
light
touch
like
a
cushion
he
stopped
rocking
abruptly
looked
about
on
all
sides
uneasily
and
coughed
a
little
why
yes
he
said
after
a
pause
that
good
advice
if
i
want
to
make
a
pleasant
impression
in
my
new
position
as
he
spoke
he
turned
to
the
window
causing
her
hand
to
slip
down
on
his
neck
lilly
swallowed
a
sigh
and
he
jumped
up
to
take
leave
she
was
too
embarrassed
to
invite
him
to
remain
the
maid
was
already
standing
outside
with
a
lamp
to
light
his
way
down
the
stairs
day
after
lilly
called
to
him
from
the
window
he
nodded
up
his
thanks
and
disappeared
in
the
dark
poor
poor
fellow
engulfed
in
bitterness
and
despondency
he
walked
away
little
divining
what
happy
gardens
blossomed
about
him
the
rest
of
the
evening
lilly
was
absorbed
in
anxious
confused
thoughts
i
ought
not
to
have
laid
my
hand
on
his
head
she
said
to
herself
nevertheless
she
was
glad
she
had
the
next
morning
a
postal
card
came
from
jula
saying
she
had
gotten
word
from
up
there
everything
was
proceeding
smoothly
protégé
was
to
enter
his
position
immediately
money
for
his
travelling
expenses
had
already
been
forwarded
to
him
lilly
wept
tears
of
joy
her
work
was
complete
her
girlhood
friend
had
been
saved
and
won
back
to
life
with
work
and
effort
with
deception
and
fear
she
had
made
him
her
own
and
when
he
came
the
next
evening
as
had
been
arranged
she
would
tell
him
all
that
about
her
loving
him
when
she
was
a
girl
everything
and
once
again
before
parting
she
would
lay
her
hand
on
his
mass
of
hair
then
what
would
might
follow
the
next
evening
she
exercised
greater
care
in
dressing
than
was
her
wont
when
she
and
fritz
redlich
were
together
she
herself
had
cooked
his
potato
soup
and
cut
the
right
amount
of
beefsteak
for
him
he
no
longer
devoured
such
huge
portions
all
the
maid
had
to
do
was
put
it
in
the
saucepan
the
clock
struck
eight
he
had
not
come
he
busy
packing
she
comforted
herself
the
clock
struck
ten
hopeless
he
was
not
coming
but
perhaps
he
was
standing
on
the
street
outside
the
locked
door
clapping
the
way
richard
sometimes
did
lilly
remained
leaning
out
of
the
window
until
the
clock
struck
eleven
then
she
went
to
bed
sad
and
weary
the
next
morning
she
received
the
following
letter
my
dear
czepanek
after
i
have
succeeded
through
my
own
efforts
in
establishing
a
livelihood
for
myself
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
terminate
my
former
life
which
as
i
pointed
out
to
you
several
times
too
frequently
forced
me
into
circumstances
conflicting
with
my
principles
my
firm
character
was
led
into
temptations
from
which
i
will
candidly
confess
it
did
not
always
emerge
intact
i
am
well
aware
that
i
am
under
great
obligations
to
you
and
i
hereby
duly
express
my
thanks
nobody
shall
say
fritz
redlich
is
an
ingrate
i
have
kept
an
accurate
account
of
the
cash
that
circumstances
compelled
me
to
accept
from
you
i
will
return
it
also
the
suit
i
am
wearing
as
soon
as
my
salary
will
enable
me
to
but
had
you
really
respected
me
you
would
have
spared
me
that
humiliating
encounter
with
the
gentleman
to
whom
the
garment
in
question
evidently
once
belonged
i
may
not
conclude
without
making
the
following
remarks
improve
your
ways
czepanek
they
are
a
slap
in
the
face
of
all
the
laws
of
morality
i
believe
in
giving
you
this
advice
i
prove
myself
to
be
a
truer
friend
than
if
i
had
continued
to
let
you
think
me
a
dunce
i
remain
your
ever
grateful
fritz

cand
phil
et

lilly
suffered
long
and
deeply
from
this
experience
it
was
not
until
some
months
later
when
the
maid
gave
notice
because
the
solitary
evenings
with
the
very
moral
young
student
had
not
remained
without
consequences
that
lilly
could
get
herself
to
see
that
the
incident
had
its
humorous
aspect
chapter
xii
early
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
richard
went
to
ostend
to
have
a
married
man
vacation
while
lilly
cheaply
and
innocently
passed
for
a
widow
of
rank
in
a
hall
resort
on
the
baltic
sea
she
accepted
the
homage
of
several
old
maids
allowed
a
young
missionary
to
dedicate
a
volume
of
verse
to
her
and
respectfully
declined
the
honourable
proposal
of
a
widower
the
city
treasurer
of
pirna
those
were
six
weeks
to
her
liking
the
following
winter
went
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
preceding
at
christmas
richard
presented
her
with
a
hired
carriage
the
door
of
which
of
course
was
decorated
with
the
coronet
he
had
engaged
it
in
order
to
avoid
disagreeable
encounters
with
his
mother
who
spoke
of
lilly
with
increasing
severity
and
had
frequently
demanded
the
equipage
when
he
was
out
driving
with
his
mistress
he
also
gave
lilly
a
sable
cloak
one
of
the
sort
with
countless
tails
which
cost
a
small
fortune
despite
richard
reproaches
she
made
little
use
of
either
that
feeling
of
dread
never
to
be
stilled
told
her
that
such
false
display
would
drive
her
ever
on
into
the
world
which
she
wanted
to
flee
and
while
richard
endeavoured
with
dogged
greed
to
drain
the
cup
of
worldly
delights
to
the
very
dregs
lilly
desires
went
out
more
and
more
to
respectability
she
clung
to
it
as
the
last
hope
which
enabled
her
to
drag
through
her
existence
the
complete
poverty
of
which
tormented
her
increasingly
there
amid
the
lights
and
music
and
laughter
the
only
one
in
her
circle
who
now
and
then
stimulated
her
intellectually
was
jula
jula
could
tell
stories
and
she
showed
familiarity
with
other
worlds
her
experiences
in
which
she
elaborated
with
a
lively
fancy
but
for
some
time
a
veil
of
impenetrable
mysteries
have
shrouded
that
foolish
curly
head
of
hers
the
erotic
verse
she
was
wont
to
publish
disappeared
from
the
magazines
and
her
nymphomaniac
little
tales
were
nowhere
to
be
found
when
her
friends
asked
her
teasingly
what
become
of
your
art
she
would
laugh
coyly
like
a
bride
and
reply
wait
you
see
lilly
would
now
have
liked
to
become
more
intimate
with
jula
having
long
ceased
to
consider
herself
morally
superior
but
she
could
not
succeed
in
approaching
her
and
so
she
locked
her
distress
and
her
longing
in
her
own
soul
and
went
her
way
thirsting
it
happened
on
the
nineteenth
of
march
lilly
never
forgot
the
date
because
it
was
joseph
day
a
day
of
rough
spring
winds
and
reddish
sunshine
one
of
those
days
on
which
the
world
orchestra
seems
to
tune
its
instruments
before
thrilling
our
senses
again
with
its
great
spring
symphony
the
grass
on
the
canal
embankments
was
already
turning
green
the
ducks
going
in
pairs
rocked
themselves
on
the
wavelets
and
great
foamy
shimmering
slabs
of
melting
ice
floated
to
annihilation
lilly
overwrought
by
her
painful
confused
longings
could
not
endure
remaining
indoors
she
wanted
to
run
cry
aloud
climb
over
fences
throw
herself
on
the
bare
earth
no
matter
what
but
get
away
for
a
few
hours
from
her
prison
which
smelled
of
powder
and
perfumes
and
was
burdened
by
the
spirit
of
idleness
she
dressed
herself
for
going
out
gave
a
few
directions
to
the
maid
this
time
an
elderly
patronising
person
thoroughly
accustomed
to
service
with
single
ladies
and
without
troubling
to
order
her
carriage
took
the
electric
tram
to
the
grunewald
at
the
fencing
where
the
houses
of
the
rich
come
to
an
end
and
the
abused
woods
rise
high
above
the
restraining
yoke
of
man
lilly
got
out
and
walked
rapidly
without
caring
in
what
direction
a
few
automobiles
whizzed
past
some
gentlemen
in
one
of
them
laughed
and
beckoned
to
her
perhaps
merely
in
sport
perhaps
they
actually
recognised
her
in
either
case
it
was
best
to
leave
the
public
road
so
she
turned
into
the
path
leading
along
the
lake
to
the
old
jagdschloss
here
nobody
was
to
be
seen
far
or
near
the
cold
march
wind
swept
across
the
milky
water
and
whirled
in
the
reeds
causing
the
dry
stalks
to
rattle
and
crackle
ice
still
glittered
near
the
edge
though
the
crust
was
so
thin
and
that
each
little
wave
striving
for
the
shore
sent
tiny
springs
shooting
up
through
the
holes
here
and
there
from
a
pine
bough
came
a
bird
song
sorry
enough
to
extinguish
timid
spring
hopes
in
the
city
streets
it
looks
more
like
spring
than
here
thought
lilly
but
the
freshness
of
the
wind
redolent
of
moss
and
pine
needles
did
her
good
she
battled
against
its
might
taking
long
strides
her
cheeks
tingled
her
frozen
blood
thawed
and
sent
fresh
life
pulsating
through
her
fallow
body
and
her
fallow
soul
suddenly
she
shook
with
a
fit
of
laughter
it
was
all
nonsense
her
regret
and
her
yearning
richard
snobbish
ambition
his
eternal
marriage
schemes
even
the
respectability
she
desired
was
utterly
vapid
what
would
she
do
with
it
she
lilly
the
free
the
wild
the
ruined
there
was
something
else
something
higher
there
must
be
not
in
salmoni
sense
no
oh
no
something
as
hard
and
pure
and
as
this
march
wind
sweeping
through
her
limbs
above
her
in
a
pine
tree
she
heard
a
chipping
sound
which
she
had
learned
to
recognise
at
lischnitz
it
was
a
call
both
of
fear
and
invitation
which
ended
in
a
snappy
lilly
stood
still
looked
up
and
whistled
a
pair
of
squirrels
had
been
chasing
about
the
trunk
in
corkscrew
lines
and
now
at
her
appearance
stood
stock
still
in
fright
lilly
clucked
to
incite
the
little
red
coats
to
play
she
did
not
succeed
and
picked
up
a
pebble
from
the
ground
just
as
she
was
about
to
throw
it
she
saw
behind
a
tree
trunk
two
eyes
fastened
on
her
large
questioning
astonished
eyes
which
narrowed
under
her
gaze
and
darkened
and
tried
to
turn
away
but
could
not
she
knew
those
eyes
she
had
looked
into
them
long
long
long
ago
but
no
she
had
not
she
had
never
before
seen
them
the
young
man
who
like
herself
had
been
watching
the
squirrels
play
and
was
still
standing
behind
the
trunk
his
hat
in
his
hand
was
an
utter
stranger
impossible
that
she
had
ever
in
her
life
met
him
if
she
had
she
would
never
have
forgotten
him
it
was
not
easy
to
forget
that
serious
reserved
greek
face
with
the
nervous
nose
narrow
across
the
bridge
and
the
shining
dreamer
eyes
his
appearance
was
not
extremely
elegant
it
pleased
lilly
better
so
he
wore
a
brown
somewhat
overcoat
and
the
suit
beneath
of
which
she
caught
a
glimpse
was
of
a
woolly
material
sprinkled
with
little
tufts
by
no
means
of
german
make
and
certainly
not
english
gradually
life
came
into
him
he
put
on
his
hat
and
stepped
from
behind
the
tree
now
he
speak
to
me
the
sickening
thought
shot
through
mind
no
he
merely
raised
his
hat
glanced
at
her
again
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
with
an
expression
of
query
astonishment
and
at
the
same
time
recognition
walked
past
her
and
took
the
way
she
had
just
come
lilly
also
wanted
to
leave
the
spot
but
she
was
unable
to
and
since
she
must
not
be
discovered
looking
after
him
she
hid
behind
the
same
tree
that
had
concealed
him
i
wonder
whether
he
will
look
back
no
he
did
not
look
back
either
she
felt
hurt
and
neglected
the
tall
figure
dwindled
in
the
distance
never
been
in
the
army
she
thought
judging
from
his
rather
heavy
gait
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
stooped
drew
himself
up
again
and
looked
back
in
fact
he
spied
about
a
long
time
as
if
compelled
to
discover
her
but
she
kept
herself
carefully
hidden
and
did
not
move
he
walked
on
and
disappeared
behind
a
curve
what
a
pity
i
did
take
the
carriage
thought
lilly
she
might
be
overtaking
him
now
without
appearing
to
follow
him
and
the
coronet
would
not
have
failed
of
its
effect
as
it
was
he
naturally
cherished
a
bad
opinion
of
the
lady
who
walked
about
alone
whistling
like
a
boy
and
throwing
pebbles
at
poor
enamoured
squirrels
nevertheless
while
walking
homeward
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
presented
with
a
lovely
gift
where
could
she
have
seen
him
before
she
recalled
a
young
man
of
the
dresden
days
it
was
once
when
she
was
out
walking
arm
in
arm
with
the
colonel
along
the
prager
strasse
she
had
seen
eyes
fixed
upon
her
with
the
very
same
sad
flash
of
recognition
in
them
then
she
remembered
it
well
she
had
wanted
to
look
back
and
ask
him
who
are
you
do
you
belong
to
me
do
you
want
me
to
belong
to
you
but
even
the
partial
turn
of
her
head
would
have
been
a
crime
in
her
husband
eyes
and
now
now
that
she
was
free
free
to
choose
her
friends
according
to
her
heart
desire
she
had
let
him
go
him
the
one
whether
the
same
as
the
dresden
man
or
another
who
belonged
to
her
perchance
as
she
to
him
she
walked
along
with
eyes
and
conjured
up
his
image
a
small
dark
beard
so
on
his
cheeks
as
to
give
them
a
blue
sheen
such
beards
were
seldom
to
be
seen
in
berlin
frenchmen
and
italians
affected
them
full
firm
tightly
compressed
lips
lips
such
as
a
sculptor
chisels
a
high
square
forehead
on
which
something
like
wrath
seemed
to
be
imprinted
not
ordinary
wrath
against
herself
or
any
poor
mortal
it
was
not
of
this
world
and
it
really
was
divine
love
thus
lilly
enthusiasm
fed
itself
she
forgot
the
way
and
strayed
about
finally
arriving
at
a
spot
in
an
entirely
different
direction
from
that
which
she
should
have
taken
the
most
dreadful
things
might
have
happened
to
her
in
the
woods
where
solitary
ladies
are
exposed
to
encounters
with
tramps
at
any
hour
of
the
day
but
she
scarcely
gave
heed
to
her
danger
she
reached
home
two
hours
too
late
tired
but
in
a
glow
she
could
not
eat
she
threw
herself
on
the
chaise
longue
and
dreamt
the
bell
rang
she
heard
a
man
voice
it
could
not
be
richard
he
never
came
before
half
past
four
adele
entered
there
was
a
strange
gentleman
outside
who
wished
to
know
whether
the
lady
had
lost
her
he
had
found
one
in
the
woods
lilly
jumped
to
her
feet
actually
the
little
brocade
case
which
she
had
held
in
her
hand
with
her
silver
net
purse
was
gone
in
her
excitement
she
had
not
missed
it
like
what
does
the
gentleman
look
tall
and
young
and
handsome
in
fact
very
handsome
a
short
dark
beard
yes
lilly
reeled
let
him
come
in
she
stammered
she
did
not
think
of
beautifying
herself
she
merely
ran
her
hands
over
her
face
and
hair
in
a
dazed
way
when
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
scarcely
recognised
him
so
thick
was
the
red
mist
before
her
eyes
i
beg
pardon
she
heard
him
say
it
was
the
serene
voice
of
a
man
whose
ways
are
not
impure
i
would
not
have
disturbed
you
had
your
address
been
on
your
cards
i
found
your
number
in
the
directory
but
i
could
be
certain
whether
there
were
not
more
of
the
same
name
in
the
city
you
very
kind
to
have
taken
all
that
trouble
she
replied
inviting
him
to
be
seated
my
name
is
rennschmidt
he
said
waiting
behind
the
back
of
his
chair
until
she
had
settled
herself
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
on
sitting
down
he
drew
the
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
she
smiled
her
thanks
and
feeling
she
must
enhance
the
value
of
his
courtesy
she
said
the
case
was
a
memento
she
prized
highly
the
loss
of
which
would
have
distressed
her
a
memento
of
my
husband
she
added
his
face
grew
a
shade
more
serious
a
little
pause
ensued
during
which
his
eyes
rested
steadily
on
her
face
reading
questioning
comparing
and
wondering
nothing
of
that
bold
groping
of
other
men
glances
a
clean
unconscious
joy
amounting
to
devoutness
lay
in
his
look
did
we
meet
just
a
little
while
ago
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
lilly
asked
warily
yes
he
replied
with
animation
and
if
i
had
been
so
awkward
i
should
have
begged
your
pardon
immediately
for
having
unintentionally
spied
on
you
i
saw
how
startled
you
were
but
i
myself
was
so
how
shall
i
say
all
i
thought
was
out
you
be
serving
the
lady
best
that
way
his
frank
blithe
manner
did
her
good
though
it
shamed
her
a
little
now
you
done
me
a
much
greater
service
she
said
feeling
as
appreciative
as
if
he
had
saved
her
life
oh
do
speak
of
it
if
only
i
had
turned
back
instantly
but
the
earth
seemed
to
have
swallowed
you
up
i
was
worried
about
you
she
smiled
to
herself
fearful
in
her
happiness
a
little
more
and
she
would
have
acknowledged
where
she
had
stowed
herself
what
did
you
think
of
me
when
you
saw
me
strolling
about
the
woods
alone
she
asked
that
you
do
feel
alone
when
you
with
nature
otherwise
you
have
had
company
with
you
you
right
she
replied
eagerly
besides
my
carriage
was
waiting
in
the
hundekehlenrestaurant
after
all
the
carriage
would
play
its
part
but
it
was
imprudent
of
me
i
suppose
you
are
also
very
fond
of
nature
very
i
hardly
know
i
must
say
in
cordelia
words
i
love
it
to
my
bond
nor
more
nor
less
to
love
nature
is
really
no
merit
nor
peculiarity
it
is
simply
a
vital
function
do
you
agree
with
me
certainly
she
faltered
and
thought
oh
how
clever
he
is
how
will
i
acquit
myself
but
to
be
quite
frank
he
continued
i
am
having
a
strange
experience
with
nature
here
i
can
not
accustom
myself
to
it
its
poverty
oppresses
me
i
am
like
one
who
has
outgrown
his
home
and
reproaches
himself
for
it
i
try
to
get
back
to
my
old
attitude
and
i
admire
and
flatter
german
nature
whenever
i
possibly
can
but
first
other
pictures
in
my
mind
must
fade
you
see
i
have
just
returned
from
italy
where
i
spent
the
last
two
years
heaving
a
deep
sigh
lilly
stared
at
him
she
felt
as
if
now
he
were
absolutely
unearthly
two
whole
years
she
asked
in
astonishment
i
am
working
on
a
large
scientific
work
on
account
of
which
no
i
was
really
sent
to
italy
on
account
of
my
health
my
uncle
who
a
father
to
me
wanted
me
to
go
i
did
think
of
the
work
until
i
got
there
then
my
own
country
and
my
studies
everything
fell
into
the
background
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
glowed
and
stared
into
space
full
of
will
and
enthusiasm
the
old
slumbering
desire
for
italy
began
to
beat
its
wings
again
in
lilly
breast
yes
she
cried
with
the
same
enthusiasm
as
he
is
it
so
there
all
ideas
grow
and
you
feel
what
you
can
do
and
you
become
what
you
wanted
to
be
from
the
first
is
it
so
i
never
been
there
but
i
feel
what
i
say
strongly
there
in
the
home
of
everything
great
and
beautiful
you
yourself
become
greater
and
more
beautiful
and
everything
sordid
passes
away
is
it
so
he
listened
dumbfounded
and
embraced
her
with
a
beaming
gaze
yes
he
replied
almost
solemnly
it
is
so
exactly
she
tingled
with
delight
did
it
not
seem
that
with
these
words
he
made
an
avowal
of
the
inner
union
between
them
the
avowal
she
had
hoped
for
from
the
very
first
instant
of
their
meeting
did
it
not
seem
that
nothing
now
separated
them
she
looked
down
helplessly
was
he
really
the
embodiment
of
that
shade
which
had
so
senselessly
fastened
itself
upon
her
soul
since
the
dresden
days
i
feel
as
if
we
had
met
before
she
said
softly
without
raising
her
eyes
exactly
the
way
i
feel
he
rejoined
hastily
but
it
can
not
be
for
i
should
know
where
and
when
were
you
in
dresden
six
years
ago
at
about
this
time
no
he
said
six
years
ago
i
was
studying
at
bonn
the
semester
came
to
an
end
at
this
season
but
i
went
directly
to
my
uncle
who
was
having
his
castle
restored
where
is
his
castle
near
coblenz
so
they
had
not
met
in
dresden
but
if
we
both
have
the
same
feeling
said
lilly
there
are
pictures
in
our
souls
which
seem
to
be
recollections
but
in
fact
are
previsions
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
one
that
one
walks
as
on
the
edge
of
a
knife
between
the
past
and
the
present
and
reels
and
falls
into
a
void
the
instant
what
the
instant
he
broke
off
i
beg
your
pardon
are
you
an
artist
why
she
asked
unpleasantly
taken
aback
did
he
want
to
make
merry
at
her
expense
i
read
your
sign
outside
the
sign
pressed
flower
studio
violently
torn
out
of
sweet
dreams
and
plunged
into
bitter
reality
but
now
she
must
be
on
her
guard
she
must
not
lose
his
esteem
in
a
way
she
replied
a
very
modest
sort
of
art
which
i
used
to
pursue
but
it
made
me
very
happy
i
learned
it
just
after
i
lost
my
husband
the
fatal
divorce
would
not
pass
her
lips
less
for
the
sake
of
a
livelihood
than
to
lend
my
life
content
but
then
i
had
to
give
it
up
because
of
a
trouble
with
my
eyes
three
lies
in
the
same
breath
why
not
she
was
lies
within
and
lies
without
every
gesture
every
thought
was
a
lie
but
the
great
cry
of
her
soul
vibrating
through
her
entire
being
you
shall
be
mine
i
will
be
yours
was
a
lie
and
for
his
sake
she
continued
to
lie
i
do
like
to
speak
of
it
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
it
still
pains
me
and
please
do
ever
again
refer
to
it
in
the
future
again
in
the
future
she
had
said
as
if
taking
it
for
granted
that
they
would
continue
to
meet
her
words
filled
her
with
shame
and
confusion
she
rose
and
turned
her
face
aside
i
beg
pardon
he
said
abashed
i
could
not
have
divined
he
rose
to
take
leave
stay
stay
stay
her
soul
cried
but
she
was
unable
to
speak
she
was
benumbed
perhaps
he
had
seen
through
her
lies
and
had
instantly
realised
who
she
was
and
did
not
care
to
remain
she
felt
haughtiness
congealing
her
features
it
was
very
kind
of
you
she
said
graciously
extending
her
finger
tips
the
moment
had
come
in
which
to
invite
him
to
visit
her
but
the
words
froze
on
her
lips
he
had
turned
very
pale
and
looked
straight
into
her
face
expectantly
i
hope
we
meet
some
time
again
he
said
finally
i
hope
so
she
replied
very
formally
he
lightly
touched
her
hand
with
his
lips
and
left
over
over
and
her
fault
happiness
had
come
had
laid
its
blessing
hand
on
her
forehead
and
had
flown
away
again
leaving
behind
nothing
but
this
pain
a
wild
pain
such
as
she
had
never
before
felt
it
fairly
tore
at
her
throat
and
heart
like
a
physical
affliction
during
the
night
she
devised
a
thousand
schemes
for
hunting
him
up
and
meeting
him
again
he
was
a
scholar
and
probably
frequented
the
library
she
would
go
there
and
read
and
study
and
some
day
she
would
surely
meet
him
or
simpler
still
she
would
write
to
him
i
do
love
you
she
would
say
why
should
i
i
scarcely
know
you
but
i
am
confident
that
i
could
be
something
in
your
life
therefore
then
disgusted
with
her
lack
of
dignity
she
rejected
every
plan
no
lilly
czepanek
after
all
would
not
throw
herself
away
in
such
fashion
once
more
it
became
impossible
for
her
to
remain
at
home
in
the
daytime
she
walked
along
the
potsdamer
strasse
and
leipziger
strasse
where
the
metropolitan
bustle
is
the
greatest
in
the
evenings
she
did
not
visit
distant
districts
as
formerly
but
with
a
busy
air
hurried
incessantly
up
and
down
the
lonely
banks
of
the
canal
near
her
home
despite
her
strict
economy
she
always
kept
the
light
burning
in
her
and
did
not
confess
to
herself
why
it
was
about
eight
in
the
evening
four
days
after
the
meeting
the
stars
hung
like
lamps
in
the
heavens
lilly
was
pacing
along
the
further
bank
of
the
canal
when
she
noticed
the
figure
of
a
young
man
who
was
looking
fixedly
in
the
direction
in
which
her
home
lay
she
could
not
distinguish
his
features
because
he
kept
his
back
turned
besides
he
had
selected
a
dark
spot
for
his
coign
of
observation
with
a
slight
throbbing
of
her
heart
she
continued
on
her
way
though
after
a
while
her
legs
refused
to
carry
her
further
in
the
same
direction
she
had
to
turn
about
she
found
the
dark
figure
still
standing
motionless
among
the
trees
from
across
the
water
the
light
in
her
peered
through
the
bare
branches
this
time
he
heard
her
tread
and
faced
about
she
recognised
his
features
and
started
he
also
thrilled
with
the
shock
of
surprise
for
an
instant
he
foolishly
pretended
not
to
see
her
but
then
he
drew
a
deep
breath
and
took
off
his
hat
with
an
abashed
smile
lilly
trembled
so
she
could
not
hold
out
her
hand
rennschmidt
she
managed
to
say
he
was
the
first
to
recover
his
composure
you
will
wonder
he
began
stepping
alongside
of
her
why
i
stand
here
in
the
dark
and
look
over
there
if
i
were
to
say
it
was
a
mere
chance
you
would
believe
me
so
i
will
frankly
confess
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
thought
that
at
our
parting
something
went
wrong
there
was
a
misunderstanding
precipitancy
i
felt
i
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
for
something
if
you
felt
that
way
why
did
you
come
up
to
me
and
tell
me
so
was
i
permitted
to
why
not
you
see
we
men
have
no
rights
with
women
except
such
as
they
give
us
no
others
exist
for
us
to
be
sure
we
may
stand
in
the
dark
here
and
bite
our
lips
did
you
do
ask
me
his
voice
did
not
quiver
but
a
tremour
ran
through
his
arm
which
grazed
hers
lilly
alarmed
stopped
and
helplessly
looked
back
at
the
dark
way
she
had
come
that
means
i
i
must
say
he
asked
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
she
saw
his
eyes
clinging
to
her
with
a
look
of
fearsome
inquiry
oh
no
she
replied
slowly
as
if
some
one
else
were
speaking
in
her
stead
now
that
we
are
together
we
will
remain
together
i
think
so
too
he
said
the
same
gravity
of
an
oath
lay
in
his
words
as
she
had
put
into
hers
they
walked
along
in
silence
then
he
began
in
a
lighter
tone
but
i
must
call
your
attention
to
something
your
light
is
burning
if
you
really
do
want
to
favour
me
with
an
hour
i
afraid
the
thought
of
the
waste
will
disquiet
you
well
we
put
it
out
she
replied
gaily
and
turned
on
her
heels
so
abruptly
that
he
continued
to
make
two
or
three
steps
forward
as
they
crossed
the
slender
arch
of
the
hohenzollernbrücke
he
pointed
up
to
the
heavens
jupiter
shines
on
our
undertaking
i
like
him
better
than
venus
who
runs
after
the
sun
and
needs
a
rosy
flooring
for
her
feet
which
is
jupiter
asked
lilly
standing
still
he
eagerly
showed
her
the
lord
of
the
heavens
and
five
or
six
constellations
lilly
clapped
her
hands
like
a
pleased
child
now
i
always
feel
at
home
up
there
when
i
alone
evenings
and
look
out
of
the
window
she
refrained
from
saying
more
of
what
was
in
her
mind
while
he
waited
in
front
of
the
door
she
ran
upstairs
turned
off
the
light
put
the
key
in
her
pocket
and
hastily
told
adele
she
would
take
supper
out
that
evening
she
lingered
for
nothing
else
and
came
hurrying
down
again
outside
the
apartment
door
she
reeled
with
joy
and
clung
to
the
post
and
sobbed
but
by
the
time
she
reached
the
street
her
bearing
had
become
quite
proper
if
you
are
willing
to
entrust
yourself
to
my
guidance
he
said
i
know
a
little
corner
no
one
would
dream
of
finding
us
in
practically
in
italy
she
drew
a
deep
breath
if
only
he
would
speak
so
much
of
italy
she
thought
though
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
she
have
gone
elsewhere
than
to
his
italian
restaurant
they
walked
along
the
canal
for
about
five
minutes
talking
nonsense
the
medley
of
lights
of
the
potsdamer
brücke
was
quite
near
when
he
paused
in
front
of
a
narrow
dimly
lighted
shop
window
where
about
two
dozen
wine
bottles
wreathed
with
green
cotton
vines
grew
like
asparagus
out
of
sand
here
signor
battistini
serves
a
chianti
than
which
none
better
is
to
be
had
in
florence
he
explained
they
entered
the
shop
and
crossed
a
small
anteroom
in
which
the
proprietor
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
was
pasting
labels
behind
the
bar
lilly
friend
greeted
him
from
the
anteroom
they
passed
into
a
rather
long
room
filled
with
simple
tables
and
chairs
the
only
decoration
consisted
of
crisscrossed
garlands
of
shiny
green
paper
bits
evidently
ambitious
of
being
considered
vine
leaves
which
twined
about
the
bare
gas
brackets
and
fell
over
hooks
in
the
walls
to
inform
the
guests
of
the
occasion
for
this
luxuriant
display
a
placard
hung
from
the
centre
wishing
them
on
this
march
evening
a
happy
new
year
what
do
you
say
to
this
fairy
garden
asked
lilly
friend
while
the
waiter
black
as
his
master
with
an
improbable
pair
of
fiery
wheels
in
his
face
beseechingly
held
out
his
hands
for
her
cloak
at
the
other
tables
sat
young
fellows
with
thick
hair
who
rolled
long
cigarettes
between
their
teeth
and
nearly
thrust
the
knuckles
of
their
clenched
fists
in
one
another
eyes
while
spouting
italian
with
fascinating
rapidity
marble
cutters
rennschmidt
explained
in
a
low
voice
our
great
sculptors
employ
them
as
assistants
they
earn
a
great
deal
of
money
and
as
soon
as
they
have
saved
enough
they
return
to
italy
to
establish
a
household
two
women
sat
apart
from
the
men
their
black
lustreless
hair
drawn
very
low
on
their
foreheads
gave
their
eyes
the
appearance
of
torches
burning
in
sombre
woods
gold
rings
hung
in
their
ears
and
their
dresses
cut
too
deep
at
the
throat
were
held
together
by
roughly
made
brooches
they
looked
at
lilly
tall
figure
in
envious
admiration
then
fell
to
whispering
busily
rennschmidt
nodded
to
them
cordially
yet
with
an
indifferent
air
as
one
who
has
nothing
to
conceal
or
reveal
ballad
singers
belonging
to
a
neapolitan
troupe
their
leader
deserted
them
and
they
now
looking
for
an
engagement
where
am
i
thought
lilly
it
was
like
a
dream
as
if
an
aladdin
lamp
had
transported
her
to
a
strange
land
the
one
thing
by
which
she
knew
she
was
in
berlin
germany
near
the
potsdamer
brücke
was
the
placard
complacent
happy
new
year
i
been
coming
here
every
day
since
my
return
said
rennschmidt
after
they
had
settled
themselves
comfortably
in
a
corner
i
can
not
cure
myself
of
homesickness
for
the
south
the
best
german
cookery
has
no
charms
for
me
and
i
must
have
my
chianti
but
we
order
some
other
wine
because
you
have
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
chianti
he
nodded
to
the
waiter
francesco
by
name
francesco
as
if
he
had
just
stepped
from
a
romance
about
knights
and
brigands
the
two
held
a
lively
conference
the
result
of
which
was
a
dusty
bottle
the
dishes
were
strange
confections
of
macaroni
and
meat
swimming
in
yellowish
red
gravy
lilly
could
not
recall
ever
having
eaten
anything
so
delicious
she
told
him
so
but
what
she
did
not
tell
him
was
that
she
had
never
in
her
life
never
since
she
could
remember
felt
so
good
the
last
course
was
a
a
little
garden
of
mandarins
dates
and
gorgonzola
cheese
the
frothy
yellow
wine
with
an
aroma
of
nutmeg
bubbled
into
the
glasses
scattering
bright
drops
leaning
against
the
wall
lilly
let
her
eyes
rest
dreamily
on
her
new
friend
face
he
turned
his
head
now
this
way
now
that
with
rapid
little
movements
like
a
bird
he
seemed
constantly
alert
to
observe
and
absorb
or
perhaps
his
manner
was
due
to
his
desire
to
bestow
some
additional
attention
upon
her
his
eyes
gleamed
with
eagerness
and
exuberance
of
life
and
the
network
of
wrinkles
on
his
brow
rose
and
fell
nervously
the
cloud
of
wrath
on
his
forehead
apparently
was
nothing
more
than
his
seething
ardour
he
had
a
dear
droll
habit
which
increased
the
impression
of
eagerness
he
would
raise
his
outspread
fingers
to
his
head
as
if
to
run
them
through
a
heavy
mass
of
hair
but
the
mass
was
no
longer
there
and
his
hand
clapped
against
his
bare
forehead
and
rested
there
a
second
or
two
everything
about
him
bespoke
force
and
decision
to
lilly
admiration
to
her
dread
nevertheless
although
a
golden
brown
tinge
of
health
from
the
south
still
coloured
his
cheeks
his
body
was
not
robust
his
throat
was
delicate
his
breath
came
and
went
hastily
and
sometimes
when
a
veil
fell
over
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
looking
inward
a
soft
weariness
crept
over
his
features
which
gave
him
an
extremely
youthful
appearance
and
evoked
motherly
feelings
so
what
you
are
she
thought
and
stretched
herself
in
blissful
peace
at
last
why
are
you
closing
your
eyes
he
asked
solicitously
are
you
feeling
well
yes
oh
yes
she
said
caressingly
but
speak
to
me
tell
me
about
down
there
where
i
always
wanted
to
be
and
never
could
be
lilly
went
on
to
tell
him
of
the
great
yearning
which
the
consumptive
teacher
had
awakened
in
her
and
how
it
had
continued
to
smoulder
under
all
the
ashes
life
had
cast
upon
it
i
in
your
place
would
have
made
a
pilgrimage
there
barefoot
pshaw
she
said
i
had
money
enough
but
i
never
been
free
once
i
got
as
far
as
bozen
and
had
to
turn
back
as
a
punishment
because
a
young
man
ogled
me
oh
dreadful
he
laughed
that
was
hard
luck
much
harder
than
you
divine
oh
i
divine
it
she
sighed
i
need
merely
look
at
you
why
at
me
because
you
shine
like
moses
after
he
witnessed
the
glory
of
the
lord
he
became
serious
there
are
glories
up
here
too
but
you
right
i
have
so
much
life
and
light
stored
up
in
me
from
down
there
so
many
sources
have
been
opened
up
so
many
germs
have
begun
to
sprout
sometimes
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
all
my
wealth
i
write
my
fingers
bloody
and
more
keeps
coming
i
would
like
ever
to
give
give
give
but
i
do
know
to
whom
to
me
she
implored
holding
out
her
hands
palm
upward
i
am
so
miserably
poor
he
looked
at
her
with
great
severe
clairvoyant
eyes
you
are
not
poor
they
have
simply
let
you
starve
is
that
the
same
thing
he
shook
his
head
continuing
to
keep
his
gaze
fixed
upon
her
rigidly
what
was
your
husband
he
asked
i
am
the
divorced
wife
of
an
army
officer
of
high
rank
she
replied
with
downcast
eyes
this
time
thank
the
lord
it
was
not
a
lie
yet
to
be
accurate
she
had
lied
for
see
what
she
was
he
clasped
her
hand
which
lay
next
to
his
on
the
table
and
held
it
an
instant
if
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
speak
of
your
life
do
he
said
later
perhaps
when
we
know
each
other
better
you
will
tell
me
i
will
tell
you
about
myself
and
how
i
came
to
do
my
work
the
work
of
which
you
spoke
that
time
lilly
asked
strangely
stirred
by
the
sudden
solemnity
of
his
tone
drawing
a
deep
breath
he
stretched
out
his
clenched
fists
and
his
eyes
stared
into
space
yes
the
work
for
which
i
live
which
is
my
goal
and
mainstay
and
future
which
takes
the
place
of
father
and
mother
and
friends
and
lover
for
which
this
draught
of
wine
was
vintaged
and
this
hour
created
and
you
yourself
you
with
your
lovely
delicate
beauty
and
your
two
begging
hands
which
were
really
fashioned
for
giving
i
thought
you
wanted
to
speak
of
your
work
said
lilly
softly
i
am
speaking
of
it
i
always
speak
of
it
i
only
want
to
show
you
how
restlessly
it
absorbs
my
experiences
how
many
for
instance
have
sung
painted
and
sculptured
the
annunciation
and
how
many
scholars
have
grubbed
over
it
yet
when
i
see
the
good
humble
astonished
almost
frightened
virgin
mary
eyes
you
are
making
this
very
instant
i
feel
the
final
word
has
not
been
spoken
the
supreme
conception
is
still
to
be
formed
you
see
that
is
the
way
everything
must
serve
my
work
are
you
a
poet
asked
lilly
completely
taken
he
smiled
and
shook
his
head
i
neither
a
poet
nor
a
painter
nor
a
historian
nor
a
psychologist
yet
i
must
be
something
of
each
and
more
to
boot
my
work
requires
it
then
he
told
his
story
his
father
had
been
instructor
at
a
university
and
an
eminent
jurist
his
mother
had
died
in
giving
him
birth
and
his
father
did
not
survive
her
long
he
then
came
under
the
care
of
his
uncle
a
rich
experienced
old
bachelor
who
had
passed
a
lively
life
in
business
and
and
now
dwelt
in
merry
singleness
in
his
castle
he
had
given
rennschmidt
an
education
and
had
assured
him
a
small
income
which
enabled
him
in
a
modest
fashion
to
indulge
his
wishes
and
whims
rennschmidt
had
intended
to
follow
in
his
father
footsteps
and
enter
an
academic
career
but
the
examinations
which
he
had
passed
honourably
had
tried
his
health
so
to
satisfy
his
uncle
he
had
given
up
the
idea
of
a
university
career
for
the
time
being
and
had
gone
out
into
the
world
he
had
been
drawn
to
italy
by
his
studies
in
the
history
of
art
which
he
had
always
pursued
with
interest
though
without
considering
them
his
life
work
what
fascinated
him
more
than
the
churches
and
the
museums
was
the
free
beautiful
humanity
in
which
the
lively
southern
race
expressed
its
personality
he
felt
as
if
it
had
awakened
in
him
a
new
free
humanity
conscious
of
its
own
powers
he
felt
more
and
more
strongly
the
original
unity
of
artistic
and
personal
experience
past
and
present
the
heroes
of
mythology
and
history
the
characters
in
poetry
and
painting
and
the
poets
and
painters
themselves
all
became
so
real
and
familiar
that
they
seemed
to
be
part
of
his
own
being
surrounded
by
a
people
saturated
with
its
own
history
possessing
the
skill
of
a
thousand
years
exercise
of
art
always
in
touch
with
the
spirit
of
the
time
it
seemed
possible
to
him
to
penetrate
into
the
emotional
world
of
past
generations
he
learned
to
distinguish
monuments
of
different
periods
and
follow
those
related
to
each
other
step
by
step
along
the
course
of
time
his
guide
always
had
been
and
remained
art
art
was
best
able
to
wring
speech
from
the
silence
of
death
and
bid
the
dust
add
new
forms
to
the
old
only
one
thing
was
still
missing
knowledge
of
the
sources
of
its
convincing
might
the
a
b
c
of
the
language
in
which
it
expressed
its
thoughts
lilly
strained
herself
to
follow
him
she
had
never
before
listened
to
such
language
yet
it
was
not
strange
remnants
from
of
old
from
times
seemed
to
cling
to
the
bottom
of
her
soul
which
harmonised
with
what
he
said
one
day
he
continued
while
i
was
staying
in
venice
i
went
off
on
a
short
excursion
to
padua
by
railroad
it
about
the
same
as
going
from
berlin
to
potsdam
i
was
keen
about
seeing
the
art
there
because
i
was
still
in
the
honeymoon
intoxication
of
my
love
for
the
early
venetians
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
completeness
i
got
into
a
little
church
in
which
there
are
frescoes
by
giotto
do
you
know
who
he
was
certainly
giotto
and
cimabue
she
said
proudly
then
i
need
say
more
i
really
had
little
left
in
me
for
him
and
his
people
because
as
i
said
the
quattrocentists
had
heated
my
imagination
now
just
conceive
a
roman
amphitheatre
completely
ruined
and
overgrown
with
ivy
nothing
but
the
outer
walls
still
standing
like
the
walls
of
a
garden
in
the
enclosure
is
the
little
church
built
of
brick
as
sober
and
prosaic
as
a
prussian
protestant
praying
barn
lilly
smiled
gratefully
a
at
protestantism
was
still
a
personal
favour
to
her
services
are
no
longer
held
there
it
has
been
set
aside
as
a
national
monument
when
i
entered
i
saw
nothing
at
first
but
a
blue
radiance
from
the
walls
a
sort
of
modest
background
with
long
rows
of
pictures
on
it
the
story
of
christ
told
quite
simply
the
way
a
preacher
speaking
to
poor
people
would
tell
it
on
good
friday
provided
he
is
the
right
preacher
for
poor
people
but
are
we
all
poor
people
in
the
presence
of
christ
lilly
ventured
to
interpose
he
paused
looked
at
her
with
large
eyes
then
assented
eagerly
certainly
but
not
only
in
the
presence
of
christ
in
the
presence
also
of
every
great
personality
of
every
great
truth
but
it
is
easy
for
us
to
cultivate
that
feeling
to
make
it
clear
to
ourselves
that
we
must
be
poor
when
what
is
given
to
us
ought
to
enrich
us
religion
is
best
able
to
inspire
us
with
the
feeling
if
it
finds
the
correct
means
of
expression
and
the
italians
did
a
poor
man
spoke
to
poor
men
therein
lay
the
wealth
of
giotto
gift
for
what
moves
us
to
tears
is
not
his
vast
competence
it
is
his
incompetence
do
you
get
what
i
mean
i
think
i
do
said
lilly
her
face
lighting
up
if
a
man
desires
something
of
us
and
can
merely
stammer
and
stutter
his
desire
he
affects
us
more
than
if
he
says
it
in
a
prepared
discourse
exactly
he
cried
joyously
that
why
giotto
scant
speech
his
stammering
created
the
whole
language
of
art
everything
before
him
had
simply
been
learned
by
heart
from
dead
byzantine
models
for
the
first
time
a
man
read
life
with
simple
eyes
and
a
simple
heart
and
extracted
from
it
what
he
had
to
say
that
is
why
he
became
the
universal
master
to
this
very
day
if
anyone
succeeds
in
portraying
supreme
suffering
and
supreme
delight
with
his
brush
he
owes
his
skill
to
that
little
church
i
can
conceive
cried
lilly
that
if
the
ocean
had
a
source
and
a
man
were
suddenly
to
come
upon
it
he
would
feel
as
you
do
in
the
exuberance
of
his
emotion
rennschmidt
seized
lilly
arm
with
both
hands
that
the
missing
figure
it
strong
enough
to
express
what
took
place
in
me
but
i
came
upon
another
source
while
i
walked
along
those
frescoed
walls
something
suddenly
stood
before
me
clearly
and
my
work
was
there
sprung
from
nothing
the
history
of
emotions
emotions
you
know
as
art
has
seen
and
portrayed
them
in
all
generations
not
only
the
pictorial
and
plastic
arts
they
are
only
a
fraction
literature
also
poetry
as
well
as
painting
sculpture
as
well
as
music
i
thought
in
that
way
i
might
succeed
in
creating
a
true
genuine
history
of
the
development
of
the
human
heart
which
no
moralist
no
historian
no
psychologist
has
yet
attempted
why
not
the
documents
are
at
hand
just
as
fossils
lie
embedded
in
rocks
for
the
guidance
of
zoölogists
they
need
merely
be
cut
out
what
do
you
think
is
it
a
work
worth
spending
a
lifetime
on
it
is
said
lilly
with
the
same
solemnity
oh
but
there
much
to
be
thought
over
first
he
went
on
you
can
not
make
an
impetuous
onslaught
like
a
bull
on
a
red
rag
often
art
leads
us
astray
because
it
strove
to
reproduce
something
entirely
different
from
the
emotional
life
of
its
time
whether
it
succeeded
or
not
is
another
question
and
often
it
was
wanting
in
the
necessary
means
of
expression
oh
you
and
i
will
speak
of
this
many
more
times
do
look
so
frightened
i
need
you
after
this
evening
i
could
not
get
along
without
you
nobody
before
you
ever
listened
with
such
faith
and
understanding
besides
i
grown
to
be
an
utter
stranger
here
the
people
i
know
are
full
of
their
own
interests
and
scarcely
listen
to
me
then
too
there
a
bit
of
madness
in
my
undertaking
of
which
i
really
ought
to
be
ashamed
but
one
thing
comforts
me
a
bit
of
madness
has
underlain
every
great
work
until
that
work
was
completed
and
had
compassed
its
end
of
course
everybody
has
the
same
idea
of
his
own
work
so
some
time
i
rise
above
that
feeling
but
now
while
i
wrestling
and
every
day
i
think
i
have
discovered
a
new
vein
of
gold
and
then
am
compelled
to
throw
a
good
deal
away
because
it
pinchbeck
if
i
have
nobody
on
whom
i
can
pour
out
what
oppresses
and
torments
me
why
the
jumble
fairly
chokes
me
so
fate
sent
me
to
you
it
was
like
an
inner
voice
which
would
not
let
me
rest
at
my
desk
but
sent
me
out
to
watch
your
light
now
i
have
you
and
i
wo
let
you
go
god
knows
i
should
be
so
bold
in
my
own
behalf
but
it
for
my
work
it
is
clamouring
for
you
for
heaven
sake
why
are
you
crying
i
not
crying
said
lilly
and
smiled
at
him
but
the
tears
kept
rising
and
veiled
his
lovely
picture
i
know
what
it
is
he
said
sadly
i
was
considerate
you
are
regretting
your
lost
art
because
i
spoke
so
happily
of
my
own
work
lilly
started
back
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
and
made
vehement
denial
no
no
it
is
that
really
not
but
he
persisted
in
his
belief
which
drove
the
thorn
of
her
own
unworthiness
all
the
deeper
into
her
soul
let
us
go
she
requested
there
is
so
much
assailing
me
happiness
and
unhappiness
and
all
sorts
of
things
outside
i
be
calmer
it
was
long
after
midnight
a
cold
wind
swept
across
the
water
and
soughed
in
the
bare
branches
he
offered
her
his
arm
and
lilly
nestled
in
it
as
if
she
had
been
at
home
there
from
times
immemorial
for
a
while
they
were
both
silent
in
five
minutes
he
leave
me
she
thought
she
could
not
bear
the
grief
of
impending
loss
one
thing
is
lying
heavy
on
my
conscience
he
began
you
might
think
me
overweening
because
i
make
so
much
of
myself
but
i
do
wish
to
appear
more
important
than
others
i
know
every
vigorous
young
fellow
must
have
a
similar
work
to
bring
purpose
into
his
life
one
has
a
book
to
write
another
a
business
to
carry
on
another
a
dependent
to
support
for
some
it
enough
if
they
keep
their
heads
above
water
it
does
matter
what
if
you
let
yourself
go
you
lost
and
none
of
us
want
to
be
lost
do
we
i
think
i
lost
myself
long
ago
whispered
lilly
shuddering
and
crouching
like
a
whipped
dog
he
burst
out
laughing
you
the
best
the
finest
the
noblest
she
knew
how
undeserved
his
praise
was
yet
how
delicious
oh
how
delicious
they
were
now
walking
so
closely
pressed
against
each
other
that
their
cheeks
almost
touched
she
closed
her
eyes
and
ardently
drank
in
the
warm
breath
of
his
life
she
felt
she
was
being
wafted
to
unknown
blessed
distances
she
did
not
come
to
herself
until
they
reached
her
home
when
he
asked
her
she
had
no
time
the
next
day
she
was
invited
out
but
the
day
after
yes
the
day
after
she
had
the
whole
evening
free
he
need
only
call
for
her
for
fear
she
might
after
all
ask
him
to
come
the
very
next
day
she
hurried
into
the
house
ran
up
the
steps
and
concealed
her
happiness
in
the
hushed
apartment
she
did
not
turn
on
the
lights
the
street
lamps
shining
on
the
walls
of
the
and
touching
rainbow
colours
on
the
chandelier
prisms
provided
sufficient
illumination
she
began
to
wander
through
the
open
doors
from
room
to
room
into
the
corner
where
the
bed
stood
around
the
dining
table
across
the
into
the
cold
guest
room
which
had
never
received
a
guest
up
and
down
back
and
forth
singing
crying
exulting
and
from
amid
her
tears
and
singing
and
exultation
suddenly
arose
how
did
it
go
come
my
beloved
let
us
go
forth
into
the
field
let
us
spend
the
night
in
the
villages
let
us
get
up
early
to
the
vineyards
let
us
see
if
the
vine
have
blossomed
no
not
quite
a
little
different
but
she
would
surely
get
it
impetuously
she
raised
the
lid
of
the
piano
which
had
long
remained
closed
as
if
the
neglected
instrument
unforced
into
silence
had
suddenly
acquired
a
life
of
its
own
a
flood
of
sound
rushed
toward
her
of
which
she
had
deemed
neither
the
piano
nor
herself
capable
let
us
see
if
the
young
grape
have
opened
whether
the
pomegranates
have
budded
there
will
i
give
my
young
love
unto
thee
yes
that
was
the
way
it
went
exactly
she
had
found
each
note
again
where
had
it
kept
itself
hidden
all
those
long
years
it
seemed
as
if
the
last
time
she
had
sung
it
had
been
the
very
day
before
yet
worlds
of
suffering
lay
between
no
not
suffering
if
only
it
had
been
suffering
thought
lilly
the
song
of
songs
would
never
have
become
mute
chapter
xiii
the
next
morning
on
awaking
lilly
began
to
worry
anew
nobody
was
so
blind
as
not
to
detect
on
coming
closer
how
was
her
existence
least
of
all
he
whose
fine
feelings
vibrated
under
each
spiritual
touch
and
awoke
an
anxious
echo
in
her
soul
even
if
it
were
possible
for
her
to
create
a
sort
of
island
on
which
she
might
prevent
him
from
coming
into
contact
with
her
world
was
her
very
appearance
a
traitor
all
those
mad
nights
could
not
have
passed
over
her
without
leaving
traces
two
years
before
salmoni
had
already
remarked
a
change
in
her
appearance
a
cold
disdainful
look
he
had
said
she
jumped
from
bed
and
ran
to
the
mirror
to
subject
every
feature
to
suspicious
scrutiny
her
eyes
had
grown
tired
there
was
no
disputing
that
but
they
did
not
look
disdainful
virgin
mary
eyes
rennschmidt
had
said
not
madonna
eyes
was
there
a
difference
on
her
brow
were
faint
cobwebby
lines
but
she
could
rub
them
away
with
her
finger
they
will
disappear
with
a
little
massaging
she
said
to
herself
but
the
deep
grooves
on
either
side
of
her
mouth
were
bad
they
gave
her
face
a
haughty
satiated
expression
the
paths
that
consuming
passion
long
has
trod
she
quoted
from
tannhäuser
in
rom
which
she
knew
almost
by
heart
and
yet
had
she
not
preserved
her
noblest
her
profoundest
feelings
as
if
to
save
them
up
for
this
one
and
now
that
the
one
had
come
it
was
too
late
perhaps
she
spent
the
day
in
misery
and
when
richard
came
for
his
tea
he
found
red
eyes
that
afternoon
proved
to
her
clearly
what
she
possessed
in
richard
he
asked
so
few
questions
and
was
so
sympathetic
and
full
of
solicitude
that
for
a
moment
or
two
she
felt
comforted
and
secure
she
almost
succumbed
to
the
temptation
to
tell
him
a
little
about
her
new
acquaintance
as
was
right
between
two
such
good
friends
fortunately
she
resisted
the
impulse
rather
let
adele
into
the
secret
who
had
several
times
observed
encouragingly
you
may
trust
me
fully
i
know
life
far
too
well
not
to
take
the
side
wishing
to
avoid
the
whole
crew
as
she
dubbed
the
circle
of
her
friends
lilly
pled
sickness
and
richard
rested
satisfied
in
the
evening
it
occurred
to
her
she
had
told
rennschmidt
she
was
going
out
she
hastily
put
out
the
light
and
sat
brooding
in
the
dark
until
bedtime
the
next
morning
the
mail
brought
her
a
letter
addressed
in
an
unknown
hand
she
tore
the
envelope
open
and
read
i
can
not
rest
i
can
not
sleep
before
i
speak
to
you
before
the
prayer
torn
from
out
my
breast
in
passionate
outpour
swiftly
on
wind
and
wave
to
you
is
borne
i
sit
and
dream
by
lighted
lamp
still
lies
my
work
with
hours
stolen
i
entwine
a
crown
of
flame
that
heavenly
aspires
in
tongues
of
fire
up
round
your
head
divine
oh
chide
me
not
for
uttering
words
uncalled
chastise
me
not
for
sacred
spell
i
broken
in
which
your
lofty
spirit
is
enthralled
i
am
a
struggler
i
must
needs
have
spoken
good
heavens
did
this
refer
to
her
to
lilly
czepanek
who
ate
her
heart
out
in
dull
if
any
human
being
in
the
world
could
think
of
her
so
above
all
the
most
glorious
she
knew
the
poem
though
unsigned
came
from
him
then
after
all
she
was
not
in
such
a
bad
way
then
perhaps
her
life
had
not
taken
a
permanent
hold
upon
her
probably
her
innermost
being
had
remained
intact
and
values
lay
strewn
in
her
soul
which
needed
only
to
be
used
in
order
to
sanctify
and
bless
herself
and
others
long
after
she
knew
the
verses
by
heart
she
read
them
again
and
again
she
could
not
tear
her
eyes
from
the
beloved
writing
then
she
tried
to
set
the
words
to
music
she
opened
the
piano
and
fantasied
her
playing
came
back
to
her
as
on
the
other
night
everything
she
had
known
as
a
girl
and
had
thought
long
forgotten
came
back
she
needed
merely
to
drop
her
fingers
on
the
keys
and
there
it
was
or
nearly
so
but
her
finger
joints
were
stiff
and
the
muscles
of
her
lower
arm
soon
wearied
she
would
have
to
practise
and
limber
them
when
he
visits
me
i
can
even
play
a
classic
for
him
she
thought
buoyed
by
the
new
hope
she
floated
further
along
on
the
current
of
her
newly
won
at
the
same
time
she
kept
careful
count
of
each
minute
that
separated
her
from
the
evening
richard
found
her
practicing
assiduously
what
gotten
into
you
he
asked
i
had
the
slightest
idea
you
could
play
so
well
neither
had
i
laughed
lilly
you
must
play
for
the
others
this
very
evening
this
evening
lilly
asked
alarmed
i
thought
i
had
this
evening
free
free
what
do
you
mean
by
free
he
rejoined
evidently
annoyed
you
act
just
as
if
our
going
out
in
company
were
heaven
knows
what
a
sacrifice
you
keep
to
yourself
whenever
you
can
possibly
get
a
chance
yesterday
in
fact
karla
said
nobody
really
knows
what
sort
of
life
you
lead
i
think
that
applies
much
better
to
karla
than
to
me
nobody
really
knows
her
name
it
does
matter
others
have
criticised
your
reserved
ways
too
one
man
even
hinted
i
better
keep
my
eye
on
you
more
than
i
do
and
not
let
you
go
your
own
way
so
much
so
to
hush
them
up
i
promised
i
bring
you
this
evening
instead
of
yesterday
there
no
getting
out
of
it
lilly
instantly
reflected
that
a
refusal
far
from
helping
would
merely
arouse
his
dormant
suspicions
so
she
bravely
choked
down
fright
and
tears
but
when
he
left
the
anguish
of
disappointment
was
all
the
keener
what
would
rennschmidt
think
if
he
came
at
the
appointed
time
and
found
her
out
since
he
had
not
mentioned
his
address
she
could
not
write
to
him
and
he
would
have
a
full
day
in
which
to
nurse
evil
suspicions
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
she
sought
comfort
with
adele
whose
dry
peevish
face
perceptibly
brightened
she
seemed
to
be
in
her
element
when
it
came
to
deceiving
a
person
or
better
still
two
persons
the
best
thing
she
said
would
be
for
you
to
say
a
sick
friend
had
asked
you
to
come
something
sad
like
that
takes
them
all
in
she
knew
it
from
experience
she
assured
lilly
that
evening
her
friends
did
not
get
much
entertainment
out
of
lilly
she
disregarded
the
gentlemen
and
gave
the
ladies
rude
answers
jula
the
only
one
whose
presence
would
have
pleased
her
was
absent
as
had
become
usual
of
late
they
finally
left
her
to
herself
and
richard
the
dear
fellow
who
had
hoped
to
parade
his
possession
helplessly
gnawed
the
ends
of
his
moustache
the
next
morning
lilly
again
suffered
the
torments
of
dread
when
she
had
come
home
the
night
before
despite
the
late
hour
she
had
awakened
adele
who
said
he
had
come
and
had
looked
dreadfully
upset
he
had
gone
away
without
saying
anything
another
day
spent
in
nervously
counting
the
minutes
she
stood
in
front
of
the
mirror
utterly
despondent
and
dressed
herself
for
him
she
would
have
liked
to
sink
at
his
feet
when
he
entered
nevertheless
she
determined
to
maintain
in
words
and
gesture
then
and
in
the
future
a
certain
gentle
melancholy
grandeur
of
manner
which
would
nip
suspicion
in
the
bud
and
would
correspond
with
the
picture
of
her
he
had
drawn
in
his
verses
when
she
thought
that
that
stupid
head
of
hers
should
from
now
on
be
a
head
divine
she
grew
thoroughly
ill
at
ease
from
sheer
sanctity
at
half
past
seven
the
bell
rang
she
received
him
with
a
conventional
smile
and
the
gentle
melancholy
grandeur
which
she
succeeded
in
adopting
perfectly
concealed
her
harassed
spirits
his
manner
she
saw
at
the
first
glance
was
also
constrained
his
eyes
glided
past
her
with
a
singularly
empty
expression
he
has
divined
everything
her
soul
cried
but
she
bore
up
nobly
i
must
beg
your
pardon
she
said
for
not
having
kept
our
appointment
i
hope
your
friend
is
feeling
better
he
said
while
a
disdainful
smile
of
doubt
played
about
his
lips
she
made
all
kinds
of
explanations
said
whatever
came
into
her
head
and
without
looking
at
him
she
knew
he
believed
not
a
syllable
i
must
beg
pardon
he
rejoined
after
she
had
finished
with
the
same
lurking
disdain
in
his
voice
and
smile
why
i
sent
you
some
verses
which
i
hope
you
will
consider
nothing
more
than
what
they
really
are
a
mere
harmless
stylistic
effort
without
sense
or
significance
he
already
withdrawing
her
guilty
conscience
cried
and
all
the
colder
and
worldlier
was
her
reply
i
admit
your
pretty
verses
did
astonish
me
at
first
i
conceive
that
i
was
a
fitting
subject
to
inspire
them
but
then
i
thought
you
probably
meant
nothing
more
than
what
you
just
now
said
and
i
did
not
feel
offended
if
you
wish
we
wo
say
more
about
it
he
looked
at
her
with
great
questioning
eyes
and
she
rejoiced
at
having
requited
him
so
bitterly
wishing
to
observe
the
rules
of
decorum
she
invited
him
to
stay
for
supper
though
absolutely
nothing
had
been
prepared
for
a
guest
i
thought
i
was
to
be
permitted
to
take
you
out
he
replied
in
a
hard
disillusioned
tone
she
smiled
politely
just
as
you
wish
they
descended
the
stairs
in
silence
and
in
silence
paced
along
the
canal
the
same
way
they
had
walked
three
evenings
before
pressed
close
against
each
other
in
drunken
bliss
then
too
they
had
not
spoken
but
oh
how
different
had
their
silence
been
what
have
you
done
the
last
few
days
lilly
finally
asked
to
make
conversation
nothing
special
i
tried
to
write
an
article
for
the
on
which
i
a
collaborator
my
subject
was
the
sienna
school
outside
of
sienna
but
it
did
turn
out
very
well
the
editor
wo
be
satisfied
lilly
read
reproach
of
herself
in
his
words
evidently
he
wanted
to
indicate
that
her
entrance
into
his
life
was
to
blame
and
when
he
asked
to
what
restaurant
she
would
like
to
go
she
said
her
wounded
heart
quivering
i
neither
hungry
nor
thirsty
and
people
and
light
would
hurt
me
she
wanted
to
add
something
about
not
wishing
to
be
a
burden
and
similar
things
but
swallowed
the
words
before
they
were
spoken
if
you
wish
to
avoid
people
we
might
go
to
the
tiergarten
lilly
agreed
had
he
said
come
down
into
the
water
of
the
canal
with
me
she
would
have
assented
even
more
willingly
the
hard
park
roads
stretched
before
them
in
the
light
of
the
electric
lamps
like
long
galleries
with
garish
walls
between
which
one
was
forced
to
run
the
gauntlet
the
pedestrians
coming
toward
lilly
and
rennschmidt
measured
the
tall
couple
with
cold
intrusive
curiosity
it
worse
here
than
in
the
crowded
streets
said
lilly
her
aching
despondent
heart
fluttered
with
excitement
he
pointed
to
a
side
path
leading
into
darkness
and
without
speaking
they
dipped
into
solitude
above
the
towering
masses
of
branches
the
cloudy
sky
looking
like
a
metal
whose
brilliance
has
worn
off
reflected
the
invisible
sea
of
city
lights
through
the
lattice
work
of
the
leafless
bushes
gleamed
the
lamps
lining
the
more
public
ways
and
on
all
sides
the
gongs
of
the
electric
trams
shooting
hither
and
thither
sounded
like
fire
alarums
but
there
in
the
interior
of
the
park
quiet
and
darkness
prevailed
lilly
felt
she
had
sunk
into
a
black
sea
of
mournfulness
the
silence
between
them
became
intolerable
suddenly
rennschmidt
stepped
in
front
of
lilly
and
blocked
the
way
what
the
matter
she
asked
startled
czepanek
czepanek
what
i
am
going
to
say
what
i
am
going
to
say
his
raised
hands
jerked
back
and
forth
before
her
face
will
either
bring
us
together
again
or
send
us
apart
forever
i
was
cowardly
before
i
thought
i
could
evade
the
truth
when
i
said
i
mean
what
i
wrote
in
my
poem
i
was
lying
i
felt
exactly
what
i
wrote
and
a
thousand
times
more
strongly
but
i
ought
to
have
spoken
i
know
i
frightened
you
you
were
bewildered
you
did
know
how
to
take
me
you
probably
think
me
some
enamoured
adventurer
who
wants
to
exploit
the
trust
you
show
dear
dear
czepanek
i
promise
you
i
will
never
again
annoy
you
with
a
display
of
my
feelings
but
do
withdraw
your
friendship
from
me
please
do
just
imagine
what
would
become
of
me
if
i
were
to
lose
you
so
what
it
was
oh
god
if
nothing
else
stood
between
them
she
could
not
help
herself
she
had
to
lean
against
a
tree
and
cry
her
tears
soon
soaked
her
veil
and
she
raised
it
and
pressed
her
finger
tips
to
her
eyes
what
the
matter
she
heard
his
voice
hoarse
with
anxiety
did
i
wound
you
so
deeply
was
what
i
said
so
very
bad
i
will
atone
for
it
just
pardon
me
you
must
pardon
me
when
she
heard
him
beg
her
pardon
so
humbly
for
the
immeasurable
happiness
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
she
was
seized
with
a
frenzy
and
throwing
her
grand
manner
to
the
winds
and
her
shame
to
boot
she
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
with
a
groan
of
abandon
pressed
her
body
against
his
and
kissed
his
lips
and
sucked
and
bit
them
under
the
impetus
of
this
wild
unchaste
kiss
he
staggered
and
held
himself
erect
on
her
digging
his
fingers
into
the
flesh
of
her
upper
arm
how
good
it
felt
because
it
hurt
so
at
last
at
last
her
heart
cried
now
he
knew
who
she
was
and
what
she
had
to
give
him
when
she
pulled
herself
together
she
saw
he
had
sunk
back
with
his
head
leaning
against
the
same
tree
that
had
supported
her
his
hat
had
fallen
to
the
ground
his
eyes
were
closed
his
face
had
the
ashen
hue
of
death
for
a
few
moments
all
was
still
the
only
sound
was
the
clanging
of
the
tram
bells
my
love
my
love
she
whispered
stooping
and
then
drawing
herself
upward
on
him
wake
up
my
love
wake
up
and
come
he
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
at
her
with
the
look
of
a
foolish
slave
come
come
she
exulted
come
back
come
home
i
do
want
to
roam
about
any
more
in
the
woods
or
restaurants
come
home
come
to
me
he
did
not
respond
he
seemed
to
have
lost
his
mind
completely
a
dull
sense
of
guilt
awoke
in
her
but
was
instantly
stifled
by
joy
come
come
with
both
hands
she
drew
him
away
from
the
spot
that
had
become
the
cradle
of
her
bliss
and
his
too
was
it
remarkable
that
happiness
should
benumb
him
and
rob
him
of
his
senses
he
upon
whom
lilly
czepanek
bestowed
herself
lilly
czepanek
for
whose
favour
hundreds
had
begged
in
vain
might
well
lose
his
senses
it
by
no
means
derogated
from
his
dignity
while
she
drew
him
along
the
roads
and
streets
she
let
loose
upon
him
her
soul
tempest
in
a
delirium
of
happy
prattle
had
he
an
inkling
of
what
he
was
that
he
should
have
harboured
such
doubts
she
had
belonged
to
him
from
the
very
first
instant
a
miracle
had
taken
place
in
her
as
well
as
in
him
never
had
she
known
what
love
was
until
the
day
when
the
squirrels
chipped
over
their
heads
the
rest
of
her
life
no
longer
existed
for
her
alone
was
there
he
and
his
eyes
he
and
his
mouth
he
and
his
will
he
and
the
great
glorious
work
which
she
would
toil
for
like
a
slave
which
she
would
enrich
with
her
love
because
from
old
pictures
and
poems
he
would
gather
nothing
but
the
grey
ashes
of
love
genuine
young
blissful
love
would
teach
him
she
lilly
czepanek
who
had
waited
for
him
ever
since
she
could
remember
who
belonged
to
him
from
the
beginning
from
the
beginning
of
time
you
might
say
he
could
see
god
had
destined
them
for
each
other
because
they
both
thought
they
had
met
before
whereas
they
had
never
met
in
life
at
most
in
dreams
she
had
seen
him
in
her
dreams
always
always
exactly
as
in
fairy
tales
perhaps
it
is
a
fairy
tale
tell
me
tell
me
you
whose
first
name
i
do
not
even
know
but
no
matter
tell
me
it
not
a
mere
fairy
tale
but
he
said
nothing
he
walked
along
like
a
somnambulist
he
followed
her
up
the
steps
mechanically
and
remained
standing
stiffly
in
the
centre
of
the
into
which
she
had
led
him
when
the
lights
were
turned
on
he
looked
about
with
a
shy
searching
glance
as
if
he
had
never
seen
the
room
and
could
not
recollect
how
he
had
come
there
she
clung
to
him
and
said
he
should
sit
quite
still
and
rest
and
close
those
eyes
of
his
then
she
helped
him
remove
his
overcoat
and
pressed
him
into
a
seat
and
kissed
him
on
both
those
eyes
until
his
lids
closed
and
he
reclined
there
as
if
actually
asleep
now
wait
beloved
until
i
come
back
she
ran
joyously
into
the
kitchen
to
order
adele
to
prepare
supper
hastily
then
she
hurried
into
the
bedroom
where
she
changed
her
rustling
silk
dress
for
a
light
blue
in
which
as
richard
was
wont
to
say
gallantly
she
was
venus
herself
she
arranged
her
hair
more
loosely
and
discarded
her
rings
the
only
jewel
she
left
was
a
gold
bracelet
adele
the
sulky
had
transformed
the
table
as
if
by
magic
into
a
bower
of
flowers
and
her
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
for
at
last
there
were
human
in
this
respectably
indecent
house
the
plated
silverware
gleamed
on
the
fresh
damask
and
the
aroma
of
golden
bananas
came
from
the
fruit
basket
he
might
be
content
lilly
was
her
dread
had
disappeared
she
felt
victorious
but
her
happiness
was
too
humble
to
be
totally
unqualified
her
one
pride
greedy
for
recognition
was
that
she
had
so
much
so
much
to
give
him
when
she
entered
the
she
no
longer
found
him
reclining
on
the
to
her
terror
she
saw
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
secrétaire
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
richard
picture
oh
if
only
i
had
taken
it
away
before
she
thought
now
it
was
too
late
he
let
a
confused
astonished
look
glide
over
the
venus
robe
and
fetching
a
deep
breath
grasped
both
her
hands
why
did
you
make
yourself
so
beautiful
for
me
just
to
give
you
a
little
feeling
of
being
at
home
here
she
said
dropping
her
eyes
nothing
more
but
come
let
go
to
supper
we
have
had
anything
to
eat
all
evening
eat
and
drink
now
oh
very
well
i
just
sit
at
table
if
you
want
then
i
do
care
for
anything
either
she
cried
clinging
to
him
and
drawing
her
arm
so
tight
about
his
neck
that
the
pressure
of
his
body
fairly
robbed
her
of
her
breath
peter
the
little
ape
who
had
slept
in
his
corner
the
whole
time
awoke
and
whimpered
jealously
and
stretched
his
grey
arms
yearningly
between
the
bars
of
his
cage
as
if
wishing
to
be
the
third
party
in
the
alliance
rennschmidt
heard
the
strange
sound
and
started
lilly
smiled
and
calmed
him
later
i
introduce
you
to
all
my
little
ones
my
friends
must
be
yours
too
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
how
is
that
possible
as
what
would
you
introduce
me
lilly
hastily
parried
oh
i
did
mean
it
that
way
i
merely
meant
she
was
at
a
loss
what
explanation
to
offer
then
she
felt
his
trembling
fingers
clutch
her
upper
arm
his
eyes
burned
their
way
into
hers
who
are
you
he
asked
her
brain
reeled
who
am
i
i
am
a
woman
who
loves
you
who
has
never
loved
anyone
before
he
gratefully
caressed
her
shoulders
understand
me
he
said
i
am
not
trying
to
force
myself
into
your
confidence
but
if
the
relation
between
two
human
beings
is
what
ours
has
been
for
the
past
hour
they
want
to
mean
everything
in
the
world
to
each
other
i
have
never
met
a
woman
like
you
i
am
utterly
helpless
the
few
little
experiences
i
have
had
do
count
in
rome
a
daughter
loved
me
she
ran
away
with
a
marquis
when
i
was
a
student
i
went
through
a
few
similar
episodes
i
never
mingled
much
in
society
and
now
all
of
a
sudden
i
have
you
in
my
arms
the
noblest
the
most
glorious
thing
i
ever
beheld
a
creature
not
of
this
world
i
keep
looking
at
you
as
you
stand
there
in
your
blue
peplum
why
it
as
if
an
old
marble
statue
by
lysippus
or
praxiteles
had
come
to
life
and
that
is
to
be
mine
the
mere
desiring
of
it
is
naked
tragedy
we
are
both
making
straight
for
a
precipice
and
we
do
even
resist
why
resist
she
cried
in
bliss
throwing
her
head
back
as
if
to
toss
from
her
brow
streaming
bacchantic
locks
we
love
each
other
nothing
else
concerns
us
he
sank
into
the
chair
next
to
her
and
pressed
his
face
into
both
hands
his
body
heaving
as
with
sobs
she
kneeled
before
him
and
bent
her
head
and
planted
little
kisses
on
his
clenched
hands
no
he
cried
jumping
up
i
will
not
permit
myself
simply
to
drift
if
think
as
you
do
you
who
are
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
very
well
but
i
who
am
the
recipient
i
must
make
everything
clear
to
you
so
that
you
know
for
whom
you
are
making
the
sacrifice
i
must
leave
any
possibilities
open
to
mislead
you
nothing
but
a
poor
young
fellow
who
lives
by
his
uncle
bounty
i
have
no
prospects
i
ca
build
on
my
work
and
the
few
articles
i
write
do
count
i
must
first
toil
for
my
little
place
in
the
world
it
may
be
ten
years
before
i
secure
it
and
i
ca
let
you
support
me
think
what
you
will
of
me
but
i
must
tell
you
we
can
not
become
husband
and
wife
at
first
she
scarcely
comprehended
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
realise
that
a
man
could
be
so
naïve
so
unworldly
as
to
speak
of
marriage
in
lilly
czepanek
she
burst
into
a
strident
laugh
the
overflow
of
her
scorn
of
her
own
worthless
life
do
you
think
she
cried
jumping
to
her
feet
that
i
nothing
but
an
adventuress
who
tries
to
rope
men
into
marriage
one
of
those
harpies
jula
word
occurred
to
her
who
pounce
upon
every
passerby
for
what
sort
of
a
sorry
wretch
do
you
take
me
he
looked
into
her
face
with
astonished
uncomprehending
eyes
a
woman
who
loves
a
man
and
wants
to
be
the
joy
of
his
life
is
not
a
sorry
wretch
oh
if
that
was
what
he
meant
the
time
when
in
all
innocence
she
had
wanted
to
be
richard
wife
recurred
to
her
how
long
ago
was
it
how
low
she
must
have
sunk
if
this
most
natural
conception
of
the
relation
between
man
and
woman
should
have
become
strange
to
her
she
shuddered
and
was
aware
of
having
turned
pale
if
only
he
had
noticed
nothing
amiss
she
could
stand
much
but
not
that
humbly
in
dread
of
his
searching
eyes
she
replied
i
merely
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
you
are
free
and
will
remain
free
from
first
to
last
you
can
leave
whenever
you
want
to
and
nothing
will
have
been
and
you
he
asked
what
do
you
mean
i
as
what
will
you
remain
behind
if
i
go
i
take
care
of
that
she
laughed
the
contingency
was
very
very
remote
why
split
her
head
over
it
now
but
he
was
not
yet
satisfied
there
something
peculiar
about
you
a
whiff
of
mystery
a
a
how
shall
i
say
the
shadow
of
a
wrong
done
you
you
mingle
much
in
society
you
say
yet
i
have
the
feeling
that
you
are
lonely
and
perhaps
unprotected
whenever
i
try
to
look
into
you
i
feel
as
if
rude
hands
had
been
laid
on
you
from
now
on
i
will
stand
by
to
protect
and
advise
you
but
i
so
inexperienced
in
worldly
matters
it
can
easily
come
about
that
without
divining
it
i
may
merely
add
to
the
mischief
in
your
life
and
i
would
not
for
the
world
you
are
holy
to
me
so
you
must
tell
me
now
whatever
you
may
of
what
you
have
gone
through
and
suffered
will
you
lilly
felt
evasion
was
no
longer
possible
the
hour
had
struck
of
which
she
had
lived
in
dread
ever
since
she
had
met
rennschmidt
though
it
had
seemed
indefinitely
remote
one
of
jula
sayings
again
flashed
through
her
mind
the
road
back
into
the
community
of
virtue
leads
through
lies
it
had
begun
with
lies
with
lies
it
would
go
on
for
an
instant
the
wish
shot
up
within
her
to
tell
him
the
full
truth
but
that
was
madness
suicide
in
fact
she
need
not
lie
she
need
merely
put
a
different
face
upon
matters
the
face
they
wore
when
hope
still
shone
upon
her
life
and
she
actually
was
what
she
now
endeavoured
to
appear
to
be
it
must
be
darker
she
said
extinguishing
the
chandelier
piercing
white
glare
the
only
light
now
came
from
the
standing
lamp
which
cast
a
flowery
shimmer
upon
them
her
hands
in
his
her
head
leaning
against
his
shoulder
she
began
her
whispered
faltered
confession
she
told
of
her
sheltered
childhood
in
which
music
held
sway
a
benevolent
spirit
and
a
demon
in
one
of
her
father
flight
and
the
poverty
in
which
she
and
her
mother
were
left
so
far
nothing
to
conceal
or
alter
the
colonel
also
remained
as
he
had
been
except
that
she
occasionally
promoted
him
to
the
rank
of
general
it
was
not
until
walter
von
prell
stepped
on
the
stage
the
second
time
that
it
became
necessary
to
mix
in
fresh
colours
the
mere
acknowledgment
that
she
had
frivolously
abandoned
body
and
soul
to
a
tattered
and
torn
jovial
would
deprive
her
forever
of
her
friend
esteem
so
the
sorry
little
was
quite
naturally
converted
into
a
happy
yet
laughing
hero
who
had
been
vanquished
merely
because
all
the
dark
powers
combined
against
him
once
launched
she
sailed
serenely
on
she
represented
the
parting
as
having
taken
place
amid
a
thousand
vows
and
tears
and
bridal
expectations
as
for
the
duel
of
which
she
had
never
learned
the
particulars
she
exaggerated
its
horrors
vastly
her
lover
emerging
a
total
cripple
who
left
for
america
resolved
not
to
enter
her
life
again
until
he
should
be
in
a
position
to
atone
for
his
misdeed
by
marrying
her
so
for
the
meantime
he
placed
her
in
the
care
of
a
simple
good
young
man
who
was
all
nobility
and
for
love
of
the
vanished
friend
this
young
man
had
taken
lilly
fate
into
his
keeping
four
years
before
and
watched
over
her
and
led
her
into
society
with
rare
disinterestedness
he
managed
the
little
capital
remaining
from
her
married
days
and
always
advised
her
in
practical
matters
he
came
every
afternoon
for
a
social
cup
of
tea
and
sometimes
he
escorted
her
when
she
went
out
in
the
evening
his
circle
had
become
hers
and
everybody
they
knew
honoured
and
respected
the
fine
relationship
existing
between
them
the
basis
of
which
was
his
noble
loyalty
to
his
friend
so
lilly
czepanek
with
the
force
of
conviction
recounted
her
life
history
she
almost
believed
in
her
own
words
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
a
fair
picture
of
her
life
such
as
richard
had
once
portrayed
it
before
she
had
begun
to
slip
into
the
abyss
the
night
of
the
carnival
of
kellermann
and
salmoni
and
the
whole
crew
of
course
she
said
nothing
but
she
alluded
to
her
unfortunate
art
with
tears
for
the
last
time
she
said
then
it
should
never
be
mentioned
again
she
concluded
when
with
a
hesitating
feeling
of
security
she
looked
up
to
him
expecting
to
receive
his
absolution
she
started
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
his
face
was
livid
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
ceiling
glowed
unnaturally
deep
furrows
of
anguish
had
cut
themselves
into
his
cheeks
does
he
believe
me
flashed
through
her
head
he
jumped
up
and
snatched
richard
picture
from
the
secrétaire
and
carried
it
to
the
light
of
the
standing
lamp
lilly
knew
he
was
thinking
of
walter
and
timidly
interjected
that
is
he
then
who
is
it
his
friend
the
manufacturer
he
cast
the
picture
aside
have
you
a
picture
of
yes
but
where
was
it
the
large
pastel
was
in
the
lumber
room
the
small
one
very
likely
was
stowed
away
in
some
drawer
i
packed
it
away
she
excused
herself
because
i
could
bear
to
have
it
in
my
sight
all
the
time
she
did
not
tell
him
why
the
sight
of
it
annoyed
her
she
preferred
him
to
assume
the
cause
was
her
newly
awakened
love
how
ridiculous
how
pitiful
it
all
was
she
longed
to
sink
at
his
feet
and
cry
to
him
forgive
me
forgive
me
take
me
as
i
am
do
not
spurn
me
instead
she
lied
on
shamelessly
desperately
like
an
ordinary
adventuress
on
the
verge
of
discovery
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
hunt
for
the
picture
why
do
you
want
to
torture
yourself
please
i
beg
of
you
further
resistance
was
out
of
the
question
she
fetched
the
key
of
the
secretary
from
a
basket
opened
the
drawers
at
random
rummaged
among
the
papers
without
half
looking
and
actually
found
it
there
it
was
she
had
not
seen
it
for
years
the
eyes
looked
haughty
and
cunning
lie
and
deceive
lie
and
deceive
they
seemed
to
say
that
just
what
i
used
to
do
here
it
is
he
stepped
to
the
lamp
and
stared
at
the
picture
long
his
lips
twitched
from
time
to
time
the
picture
quivered
jerkily
in
his
hands
exactly
the
way
i
stood
in
front
of
the
rich
orphan
photograph
thought
lilly
but
that
was
long
ago
then
she
heard
him
speak
his
voice
was
hoarse
will
you
answer
a
question
upon
which
much
depends
ask
it
my
love
do
you
still
count
upon
upon
this
young
man
return
whither
did
the
question
lead
lilly
felt
she
need
merely
say
no
and
every
obstacle
was
removed
but
if
she
said
no
all
her
falsehoods
about
walter
and
his
friend
would
have
had
no
significance
so
she
had
to
choose
a
middle
course
sometimes
i
have
my
doubts
she
managed
to
say
lingering
over
the
words
i
am
waiting
for
two
now
my
father
seems
to
be
gone
gone
for
good
and
i
do
hear
from
him
either
do
you
consider
yourself
bound
just
as
you
did
then
she
felt
the
halter
tightening
about
her
neck
tell
me
something
in
his
tone
seemed
to
bar
escape
it
left
no
nook
to
hide
in
her
answer
meant
life
or
death
she
held
up
her
arms
as
if
swearing
an
oath
since
i
know
you
i
do
care
one
way
or
the
other
if
you
want
me
to
be
true
to
him
i
wait
for
him
till
judgment
day
if
you
want
me
to
throw
him
overboard
i
throw
him
overboard
he
threw
his
head
back
and
closed
his
eyes
and
stood
there
as
he
had
in
the
park
she
became
alarmed
again
for
his
sake
why
does
he
torture
himself
so
she
thought
then
it
occurred
to
her
for
the
first
time
that
he
took
her
and
everything
she
had
said
seriously
that
he
who
himself
practiced
loyalty
assumed
that
loyalty
was
a
life
principle
of
hers
too
oh
if
he
knew
she
was
so
ashamed
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
or
approach
him
he
drew
himself
up
energetically
and
his
forehead
glowed
with
the
wrathful
will
which
from
the
first
had
intimidated
her
listen
he
said
after
everything
you
told
me
i
know
i
acted
on
a
false
assumption
you
are
neglected
the
world
has
done
you
wrong
on
the
contrary
you
are
protected
and
cared
for
and
looking
forward
to
a
future
no
matter
how
uncertain
it
may
now
be
you
would
lose
all
that
through
me
the
instant
your
friend
were
to
suspect
my
existence
he
would
of
course
withdraw
his
support
and
all
the
others
who
now
constitute
your
world
would
go
with
him
lilly
wanted
to
burst
out
laughing
and
give
vent
to
her
utter
contempt
for
everything
that
had
constituted
her
former
life
but
another
thought
instantly
restrained
her
rennschmidt
must
continue
to
think
that
richard
should
not
suspect
his
existence
to
defy
her
past
and
present
was
to
bring
about
a
catastrophe
which
would
irremediably
expose
the
wretchedness
of
her
situation
she
might
be
his
only
in
dark
secret
hours
he
continued
what
i
have
to
offer
in
return
is
nothing
i
have
nothing
but
my
work
you
know
and
even
my
work
is
still
in
the
clouds
why
i
not
even
certain
of
myself
if
i
think
of
what
i
have
just
he
turned
his
eyes
aside
of
course
if
you
do
love
me
said
lilly
dejectedly
he
threw
himself
in
front
of
her
placing
one
knee
on
a
vacant
part
of
the
seat
of
her
chair
and
putting
his
arms
about
her
body
have
mercy
on
me
you
see
how
i
suffering
do
make
it
for
me
every
day
every
hour
i
should
say
to
myself
in
america
there
a
man
toiling
and
moiling
for
her
he
does
write
simply
because
he
ashamed
to
admit
that
he
has
accomplished
nothing
on
account
of
his
mangled
body
i
ca
conceive
any
other
motive
for
his
silence
a
man
does
forget
a
woman
like
you
in
the
meantime
i
sit
here
with
you
in
secret
and
hold
you
in
my
arms
i
do
know
i
a
person
can
debauch
he
can
commit
adultery
so
far
as
i
concerned
it
would
matter
but
to
rob
a
poor
cripple
of
his
all
i
think
the
lowest
scoundrel
would
draw
the
line
at
that
i
do
know
how
i
get
over
it
he
collapsed
his
forehead
hit
against
the
arm
of
lilly
chair
and
dry
sobs
shook
his
body
but
it
would
be
better
immediately
on
the
spot
better
than
later
when
it
too
late
for
both
of
us
the
blow
had
fallen
how
cleverly
she
thought
she
had
garbled
the
truth
and
here
she
was
caught
in
her
own
net
of
lies
for
god
sake
she
screamed
do
you
mean
to
say
you
will
he
rose
to
his
feet
farewell
he
said
think
of
me
in
peace
thank
you
if
i
tell
him
the
truth
he
be
all
the
more
certain
to
go
she
thought
looking
about
helplessly
his
hands
stretched
toward
her
were
waiting
his
eyes
hung
on
her
thirstily
as
if
to
drink
in
the
picture
forever
i
will
plant
myself
at
the
door
she
thought
and
throw
myself
on
him
and
stifle
him
with
kisses
but
the
desire
not
to
lose
his
respect
made
her
small
and
timorous
not
this
instant
she
implored
clasping
his
hands
one
hour
one
parting
hour
just
one
he
gently
extricated
his
hands
from
her
grasp
and
turned
to
the
door
raised
to
her
full
height
lilly
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
in
her
blue
venus
robe
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
the
wide
sleeves
fell
away
and
revealed
the
mature
womanly
beauty
of
her
arms
if
he
sees
me
this
way
she
thought
he
will
still
be
mine
but
he
did
not
turn
about
he
reeled
his
forehead
struck
against
the
door
all
of
a
sudden
he
seemed
to
have
been
wiped
out
of
existence
and
with
him
the
light
of
the
world
a
swarm
of
bees
buzzed
about
her
head
and
in
the
darkness
enveloping
her
she
sank
through
the
floor
deeper
deeper
into
the
canal
a
club
dealt
her
a
blow
on
her
forehead
and
all
was
over
at
first
it
sounded
like
a
chirping
of
birds
then
like
the
murmur
of
a
mighty
throng
in
some
wide
sunny
place
and
then
only
two
voices
sounded
one
a
man
the
other
a
woman
they
kept
up
an
eager
whispered
conversation
the
cook
maggie
and
the
lackey
with
the
mischievous
smile
of
course
that
who
they
were
the
colonel
would
enter
the
next
instant
and
want
her
to
be
his
wife
something
cool
and
damp
dropped
soothingly
on
her
aching
head
just
as
then
so
i
have
to
go
through
all
that
again
she
thought
in
terror
and
she
began
to
cry
and
entreat
oh
colonel
please
let
me
go
i
much
too
bad
for
you
oh
colonel
for
god
sake
she
raving
said
the
man
after
all
he
was
the
horrid
lackey
oh
how
deliciously
at
ease
she
lay
in
the
spell
of
that
voice
in
which
a
note
quivered
solicitously
he
did
go
at
any
rate
the
thought
tranquillised
her
and
she
settled
herself
more
comfortably
on
the
pillow
they
had
placed
under
her
neck
on
the
floor
if
she
had
known
his
first
name
she
would
have
spoken
to
him
why
how
disgraceful
not
to
know
his
first
name
yet
so
she
merely
raised
her
arms
a
little
toward
him
instantly
he
was
kneeling
beside
her
stroking
her
hands
keep
real
quiet
he
said
real
real
quiet
will
everything
be
all
right
now
she
asked
smiling
up
to
him
in
blissful
peace
yes
yes
everything
would
be
all
right
ways
and
means
would
be
found
for
their
remaining
together
like
two
friends
like
a
brother
and
sister
they
would
part
no
no
they
would
part
nobody
need
be
tortured
so
terribly
as
that
lilly
shuddered
and
thought
of
the
moment
when
the
light
about
her
had
gone
out
and
she
had
sunk
into
the
wet
slimy
depths
thus
life
would
have
been
without
him
but
now
they
would
wander
toward
the
dawning
sun
hand
in
hand
like
brother
and
sister
in
innocent
gaiety
liberated
and
purified
inconceivable
happiness
strange
that
neither
of
them
had
hit
upon
the
idea
sooner
she
groped
for
his
arm
and
with
a
contented
sigh
nestled
her
cheek
in
his
hollow
hand
but
adele
who
all
the
while
had
considerately
been
looking
out
of
the
window
thought
the
compress
ought
to
be
changed
because
the
wound
on
lilly
forehead
was
still
bleeding
chapter
xiv
each
spring
in
a
man
life
has
its
peculiar
aspect
and
its
peculiar
history
each
spring
finds
him
different
each
stirs
new
depths
and
opens
fresh
hidden
wounds
one
spring
passes
by
like
a
dull
vapid
game
because
he
himself
just
then
happens
to
be
dull
and
vapid
another
tortures
him
with
a
thousand
fruitless
admonitions
because
he
can
not
pay
off
a
penny
of
the
debt
he
owes
himself
a
third
finds
him
listless
and
sodden
as
a
field
which
can
not
recover
from
the
winter
stress
and
again
the
chants
deceptive
hymns
of
liberation
and
redemption
in
his
heart
as
if
had
the
power
to
liberate
and
redeem
but
most
beautiful
is
that
spring
of
which
we
are
scarcely
aware
for
all
the
spring
joy
within
us
whose
bourgeoning
seems
but
a
reflection
of
our
spiritual
bourgeoning
and
which
is
but
the
accompaniment
of
the
mighty
growth
that
broadens
our
minds
and
souls
and
fairly
bursts
the
bonds
of
our
being
such
a
spring
broke
upon
lilly
everything
took
on
a
new
aspect
never
had
the
morning
sun
painted
such
crinkly
laughing
grotesques
on
the
walls
never
had
rainy
days
enveloped
the
world
in
such
languishing
violet
twilights
never
had
people
faces
been
brightened
by
so
much
expectant
festivity
never
had
the
din
and
bustle
of
the
streets
revealed
so
much
joyous
purposeful
activity
why
all
of
a
sudden
lilly
also
was
overwhelmed
with
work
every
hour
was
filled
with
urgent
occupations
if
anyone
in
the
last
few
years
had
dared
to
tell
her
that
the
day
would
come
again
when
with
burning
cheeks
and
a
heated
brain
she
would
indiscriminately
cram
names
dates
biographies
lists
of
great
men
works
poetical
quotations
and
foreign
terms
she
would
have
laughed
him
to
scorn
but
it
would
never
do
to
loaf
now
she
must
be
ready
with
a
response
on
any
occasion
just
as
she
had
been
when
he
asked
her
about
giotto
all
her
eagerness
for
knowledge
which
a
feeling
of
spiritual
isolation
and
aimless
endeavour
had
dammed
up
within
her
for
years
now
gushed
out
her
mind
insatiate
as
a
fallow
unfertilised
field
absorbed
whatever
was
thrown
upon
it
she
scarcely
needed
to
put
forth
the
least
effort
if
she
merely
imagined
herself
repeating
it
to
him
it
remained
in
her
memory
she
went
at
her
studies
with
the
utmost
secrecy
konrad
yes
his
name
was
konrad
must
not
suspect
that
her
wisdom
had
just
issued
from
the
laboratory
she
also
kept
her
visits
to
the
museums
a
secret
he
was
to
suppose
she
had
always
been
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
masters
in
addition
she
had
to
practice
many
a
piece
of
early
music
which
he
wished
to
hear
for
his
work
and
often
she
blessed
her
strict
hand
which
had
held
her
down
on
the
piano
stool
throughout
many
a
long
night
lilly
and
rennschmidt
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
every
other
evening
of
course
he
avoided
coming
afternoons
which
he
knew
belonged
to
her
betrothed
friend
but
often
he
ran
up
to
her
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
bring
her
a
book
or
some
flowers
and
ask
her
for
a
bit
of
music
no
matter
how
much
she
pressed
him
he
never
remained
for
a
meal
in
fact
he
seemed
not
to
feel
quite
at
ease
in
her
apartment
he
would
walk
up
and
down
incessantly
pretty
soon
glance
at
the
clock
and
take
leave
at
first
she
felt
hurt
then
she
asked
him
teasingly
whether
he
thought
he
was
in
an
enemy
country
and
finally
she
adopted
the
policy
of
oh
she
did
not
yet
thoroughly
understand
him
each
day
laid
bare
new
unusual
sides
of
his
being
he
was
still
very
young
not
only
in
years
she
had
met
many
a
cold
blasé
old
man
of
his
youth
was
he
thought
passionately
lilly
had
never
seen
such
fervour
expended
on
pure
thinking
ideas
seemed
to
him
like
tangible
beings
with
which
he
had
to
strive
breast
to
breast
and
which
he
drew
to
himself
if
they
proved
to
be
friendly
to
his
intellectual
attitude
or
rejected
if
hostile
similarly
great
thinkers
and
creators
of
the
past
were
either
allies
or
enemies
he
associated
with
them
as
with
teachers
and
comrades
adoring
or
despising
them
submitting
to
their
reprimands
or
turning
them
into
his
thoughts
and
speech
were
in
a
constant
state
of
flux
with
and
a
whirl
of
contradictions
he
was
like
a
man
forcibly
cleaving
a
way
or
giving
merciless
chase
he
never
remained
indifferent
or
apathetic
to
a
phenomenon
spiritual
or
physical
everywhere
he
saw
problems
to
be
solved
and
vexed
questions
in
regard
to
which
he
must
take
one
side
or
the
other
he
either
loved
or
hated
he
scarcely
knew
a
stage
between
and
lilly
followed
him
with
all
the
ardour
of
a
pupil
and
lover
she
planted
each
idea
of
his
in
her
being
and
let
it
take
root
or
die
as
chance
willed
no
need
to
cherish
it
she
enjoyed
sufficient
wealth
without
it
he
spoke
little
of
his
personal
matters
not
from
distrust
or
reserve
but
because
he
deemed
them
of
small
importance
lilly
had
to
extract
jots
of
information
by
questioning
he
was
very
enthusiastic
about
his
parents
though
their
pictures
seemed
to
have
faded
in
his
mind
or
lost
form
his
uncle
had
taken
their
place
the
man
and
who
had
made
rennschmidt
his
heir
and
who
even
during
his
lifetime
allowed
him
means
for
a
modest
yet
existence
lilly
could
not
fathom
the
inner
relationship
of
the
two
men
sometimes
it
seemed
rennschmidt
cherished
a
tender
love
for
the
old
man
then
again
he
was
skeptical
almost
bitter
in
his
judgment
of
him
evidently
a
profound
difference
existed
in
their
natures
though
they
struggled
for
compromise
he
had
few
friends
chiefly
old
and
he
never
paid
purely
social
visits
as
a
result
he
could
spend
all
his
leisure
hours
with
lilly
they
sat
in
the
restaurants
generally
the
little
italian
bodega
until
the
waiter
turned
out
the
lights
over
their
heads
to
their
invariable
surprise
they
had
just
come
or
they
bought
their
suppers
for
a
few
pennies
at
a
delicatessen
shop
and
escaped
the
city
dust
in
the
tiergarten
where
they
hunted
up
an
empty
bench
somewhat
removed
from
the
public
ways
yet
not
in
too
secluded
a
spot
it
was
not
until
love
couples
began
to
wander
by
in
the
dark
like
shades
of
the
netherworld
that
they
felt
wholly
concealed
and
if
others
seated
themselves
on
the
same
bench
they
little
objected
knowing
well
that
love
couples
would
never
remain
beside
them
long
they
had
much
more
urgent
need
of
the
night
and
solitude
than
lilly
and
konrad
while
the
light
green
leaves
still
stemless
gradually
melted
into
a
dark
shadowy
jagged
mass
and
the
sunset
flames
above
merged
into
the
sombre
purple
of
night
and
the
nightingale
sang
for
them
sometimes
only
a
few
feet
away
they
would
sit
there
shoulder
to
shoulder
waiting
for
the
stars
to
dot
the
twilight
each
evening
later
and
fewer
in
number
their
winged
thoughts
travelled
far
into
the
realms
of
music
painting
northern
sagas
and
italian
landscapes
questions
of
infinity
arose
hesitating
and
halting
and
were
promptly
disposed
of
with
the
sure
clear
discernment
of
a
happy
youthful
latitudinarianism
lilly
was
now
accurately
informed
of
the
meaning
of
the
universe
and
immortality
and
the
soul
and
god
often
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
left
alone
to
freeze
in
a
vast
icy
waste
where
there
was
no
father
no
life
after
death
and
certainly
no
joseph
what
you
believe
i
suppose
is
atheism
is
it
she
asked
timorously
if
that
what
you
want
to
call
it
he
laughed
so
from
now
on
lilly
was
an
atheist
one
of
those
who
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
were
roasting
in
nethermost
hell
but
if
excommunication
did
not
drive
to
despair
she
too
could
suffer
it
she
would
even
endure
a
fatherless
condition
her
one
regret
was
for
joseph
although
he
had
not
entered
her
thoughts
for
many
a
day
none
the
less
it
was
a
pity
never
again
to
be
able
to
run
to
him
in
sorrow
or
joy
never
at
least
without
having
to
feel
ashamed
of
herself
and
that
exactly
at
a
time
when
she
needed
him
so
urgently
when
her
experiences
fairly
overwhelmed
her
with
their
force
and
number
she
felt
a
desire
to
be
lulled
and
calmed
and
the
lofty
art
that
konrad
spread
before
her
eyes
by
no
means
soothed
her
rather
it
goaded
her
on
though
to
be
sure
to
fresh
delights
they
went
to
what
few
concerts
the
late
season
still
offered
and
heard
the
eroica
and
brahms
second
symphony
and
an
unutterably
exquisite
production
by
grieg
they
would
take
their
stand
in
the
cheaper
part
of
the
house
where
they
both
delighted
to
be
and
listen
with
the
backs
of
their
hands
touching
as
if
by
chance
a
slight
pressure
conveyed
the
feelings
awakened
by
some
subtle
charm
or
expressive
bit
what
wonderful
hours
those
were
and
what
wonderful
hours
when
she
sat
at
konrad
side
in
the
pit
where
none
of
the
crew
could
see
her
as
she
learned
to
know
characters
belonging
to
every
age
and
time
and
wagner
luminous
realism
she
understood
fully
how
infinitely
poor
her
previous
life
had
been
he
took
her
to
see
the
moderns
also
of
all
the
plays
rosmersholm
affected
her
most
she
lilly
with
her
secret
guilt
was
rebecca
he
in
his
unsuspicious
purity
was
rosmer
his
spirituality
had
an
increasingly
strong
influence
on
her
as
rosmer
on
rebecca
but
if
the
filth
of
her
existence
should
gradually
roll
from
her
upon
him
would
she
not
be
his
evil
demon
his
ruination
the
thought
was
intolerable
she
wept
so
bitterly
during
the
performance
as
to
attract
general
attention
and
konrad
offered
to
take
her
out
she
indignantly
repudiated
the
suggestion
on
going
home
she
staggered
along
the
river
side
still
sobbing
he
had
chosen
that
way
because
it
was
darker
and
quieter
and
he
half
carried
her
on
his
arm
on
the
spreebrücke
she
stopped
and
stared
down
into
the
dark
living
depths
he
let
her
have
her
way
but
when
she
began
to
climb
up
on
the
railing
to
see
what
it
was
like
he
forced
her
down
from
the
precarious
position
what
the
difference
she
thought
when
he
finds
it
all
out
have
to
go
down
there
after
all
and
alone
from
that
evening
on
the
effort
to
keep
him
free
of
the
slightest
suspicion
as
long
as
long
as
possible
troubled
her
more
than
ever
occupied
her
thoughts
every
moment
of
the
day
her
great
ignorance
caused
her
no
shame
nevertheless
she
fought
against
it
with
all
her
might
but
she
lived
in
constant
terror
that
the
slovenly
cynical
tone
to
which
she
had
gradually
habituated
herself
through
long
intercourse
with
the
crew
might
crop
out
in
her
conversation
the
bit
of
carefully
cherished
rigour
and
which
she
fetched
out
from
among
the
remnants
of
her
former
spiritual
state
did
her
sluggish
being
good
and
so
she
acquired
some
of
that
grandeur
which
she
had
demanded
of
herself
at
the
beginning
of
her
relations
with
konrad
this
time
however
it
was
not
empty
affectation
but
an
inner
quality
a
natural
outcome
of
the
finest
and
tenderest
feelings
which
she
might
still
call
her
own
much
that
had
long
dominated
her
thoughts
became
unintelligible
to
her
especially
the
tendency
caught
from
her
friends
to
transfer
everything
entering
the
circle
of
her
thoughts
to
the
realm
of
the
erotic
in
astonishment
she
beheld
world
upon
world
opening
up
beyond
the
narrow
whirlpool
in
which
she
had
been
carried
around
and
around
such
a
wealth
of
great
and
beautiful
things
to
taste
and
enjoy
was
suddenly
spread
before
her
that
she
did
not
find
the
time
to
feel
ashamed
of
what
had
been
but
when
she
recalled
how
she
had
once
dared
to
kiss
him
shame
ran
hot
through
her
body
that
moment
of
wild
abandon
she
feared
might
ever
remain
a
stain
upon
his
image
of
her
yet
there
was
not
the
slightest
indication
that
he
did
not
think
of
her
with
the
same
respect
as
she
of
him
this
mutual
esteem
always
hung
between
them
like
a
gauze
veil
obscuring
the
beloved
man
face
as
behind
a
mist
of
mingled
happiness
and
anxiety
though
at
the
same
time
removing
the
sting
of
from
lilly
they
were
never
more
to
talk
of
love
love
gave
way
to
a
sweet
fraternal
though
somewhat
constrained
relationship
the
word
friendship
was
frequently
on
their
lips
they
praised
its
hallowing
force
with
a
most
serious
mien
as
if
they
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
what
it
meant
it
was
difficult
however
for
lilly
to
endure
konrad
bodily
proximity
the
one
caress
he
permitted
himself
was
to
lay
his
arm
lightly
on
her
shoulder
when
they
sat
side
by
side
though
lilly
then
longed
to
press
closer
up
to
him
she
finally
moved
farther
away
because
the
constriction
of
her
breast
mounted
by
degrees
to
veritable
torture
she
never
ventured
in
the
very
slightest
to
think
that
some
day
he
might
become
her
lover
when
unable
to
fall
asleep
she
pictured
herself
drowsing
off
with
her
head
under
his
shoulder
that
was
bliss
enough
her
fancies
scarcely
ever
strayed
into
forbidden
territory
the
chastity
of
her
maiden
days
which
the
colonel
senile
greed
had
rudely
violated
once
again
laid
its
merciful
veil
about
her
tremulous
soul
in
fact
it
was
all
as
in
the
days
of
her
girlhood
the
golden
wealth
of
thoughts
and
sensations
the
witching
glamour
about
each
little
object
the
delightful
importance
of
the
tiniest
incidents
the
hopeful
disquiet
hoping
for
she
knew
not
what
if
only
there
had
been
a
single
human
being
in
whom
to
confide
her
joy
and
fears
her
happiness
would
have
been
complete
the
desire
waxed
so
strong
within
her
as
to
be
nearly
uncontrollable
she
had
found
herself
more
than
once
on
the
brink
of
telling
her
secrets
to
richard
a
quick
way
of
ending
them
one
day
she
decided
to
visit
her
former
landlady
and
acquaint
her
with
her
great
experience
the
old
friendship
between
laue
and
lilly
had
never
wholly
died
down
though
they
saw
little
of
each
other
lilly
had
kept
herself
alive
in
the
old
lady
memory
by
sending
messages
and
little
gifts
the
tenant
of
the
best
room
opened
the
door
for
lilly
laue
as
always
was
sitting
at
her
long
white
work
table
tapping
busily
with
her
wet
now
on
a
pressed
flower
now
on
a
gluey
bit
of
paper
she
did
not
suffer
herself
to
be
interrupted
not
even
when
lilly
on
taking
a
seat
beside
her
pushed
toward
her
the
sweets
she
never
failed
to
bring
no
thanks
child
said
laue
each
bite
more
is
one
flower
less
people
like
myself
have
to
wait
for
a
holiday
before
we
can
eat
we
have
nobody
to
provide
for
us
and
keep
us
like
a
princess
i
like
to
be
in
your
shoes
just
one
day
before
i
lie
in
my
grave
go
out
walking
early
in
the
morning
with
nothing
to
do
but
feed
a
couple
of
gold
fish
as
if
that
were
happiness
sighed
lilly
do
you
mean
to
complain
of
your
lot
cried
laue
indignantly
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
thank
the
lord
every
hour
of
the
day
for
having
sent
me
such
a
friend
do
you
think
that
would
satisfy
all
your
hopes
why
what
else
do
you
want
laue
ceaselessly
tapping
rebuked
her
he
ca
marry
you
any
more
that
out
of
the
question
besides
marriage
would
be
nasty
after
all
you
gone
through
but
listen
to
me
be
careful
if
you
always
behave
yourself
nicely
he
will
make
you
an
allowance
and
you
have
something
to
live
on
all
your
life
so
i
just
to
aim
for
an
old
age
pension
well
what
else
i
can
conceive
of
many
other
objects
in
life
what
work
try
it
see
what
it
like
after
you
been
nothing
but
emotions
for
years
or
take
another
lover
then
you
be
sure
of
a
fine
time
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
child
never
for
a
single
instant
think
of
another
man
if
you
were
to
do
that
you
deserve
to
paste
flowers
like
me
sixteen
hours
a
day
until
you
die
while
incessantly
pasting
one
flower
after
the
other
she
poured
out
a
volume
of
admonitions
lilly
rose
shivering
there
was
nothing
to
be
hoped
for
from
that
quarter
she
looked
about
her
with
a
sudden
feeling
of
estrangement
i
never
come
back
here
again
she
thought
the
next
morning
the
uneasy
desire
to
open
up
her
heart
and
obtain
counsel
again
awoke
even
stronger
and
more
tormenting
than
before
her
friend
jula
occurred
to
lilly
to
be
sure
the
clever
little
woman
had
held
herself
aloof
from
the
crew
jaunts
her
friends
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
she
was
doing
and
her
when
appealed
to
became
reticent
but
lilly
felt
sure
jula
would
not
withhold
the
bit
of
comprehending
sympathy
she
needed
it
took
lilly
a
long
time
to
find
her
the
coquettish
yellow
silk
nest
her
had
fixed
up
for
her
near
the
linden
was
empty
jula
had
migrated
to
a
suburb
the
porter
informed
lilly
she
had
thought
the
neighbourhood
too
dangerous
which
made
no
sense
because
the
street
was
never
empty
day
or
night
lilly
smiled
the
porter
gave
her
the
address
and
she
drove
out
to
jula
in
a
little
bosky
corner
where
the
poets
and
philosophers
dwell
lilly
found
a
very
sober
little
house
brimful
of
books
and
manuscripts
and
busts
of
eminent
men
jula
seemed
to
have
undergone
a
great
change
she
no
longer
wore
her
curly
hair
in
a
disorderly
pompadour
about
her
forehead
but
smoothly
parted
and
drawn
down
over
her
ears
this
gave
her
a
disquieting
touch
of
virtuousness
although
that
way
of
wearing
the
hair
was
just
then
the
height
of
fashion
in
the
very
world
in
which
virtue
for
esthetic
reasons
has
little
value
though
she
came
to
meet
lilly
as
always
with
outstretched
arms
her
cordiality
seemed
not
wholly
genuine
and
though
she
beamed
with
delight
at
seeing
her
friend
again
her
expression
was
somewhat
distraught
as
if
she
were
holding
much
in
reserve
without
asking
lilly
about
herself
or
paying
any
attention
to
her
appearance
jula
burst
into
an
account
of
her
own
affairs
you
be
tremendously
surprised
but
i
ca
help
it
she
said
i
never
kept
my
little
scruples
of
conscience
a
secret
from
you
they
were
really
superfluous
my
sins
had
never
been
so
dreadful
hm
hm
thought
lilly
so
you
shall
be
the
first
of
our
former
circle
former
thought
to
learn
of
my
return
to
a
decent
existence
well
not
to
beat
about
the
bush
i
going
to
get
married
your
asked
lilly
happy
and
sympathetic
well
not
exactly
jula
regarded
her
with
a
condescending
smile
my
has
given
me
his
blessings
but
that
ends
his
rôle
then
who
is
he
asked
lilly
struggling
to
overcome
her
bewilderment
now
jula
hung
back
a
bit
after
all
you
see
it
a
long
story
she
said
hesitatingly
to
understand
it
thoroughly
you
have
to
know
more
of
the
circumstances
of
the
past
two
years
of
my
life
did
you
ever
happen
to
hear
of
an
authoress
by
the
name
of
clarissa
vom
winkle
lilly
recalled
having
seen
the
name
in
puritanic
family
sheets
which
she
had
looked
through
in
cafés
and
confectionery
shops
now
listen
that
clarissa
vom
winkle
who
won
a
very
acceptable
reputation
for
championing
the
cause
of
simple
bourgeois
morality
as
against
the
pernicious
ideas
of
love
that
clarissa
vom
winkle
am
i
lilly
was
too
strongly
under
the
spell
of
her
own
fate
properly
to
appreciate
the
humour
of
jula
avowal
just
a
glimmering
suspicion
dawned
upon
her
mind
of
the
monstrous
farce
we
human
beings
figure
in
at
life
bidding
now
on
that
account
you
not
to
think
me
a
convert
or
a
bigot
or
something
of
the
sort
jula
continued
with
a
certain
little
air
of
dignity
which
became
her
as
well
as
her
quondam
cordial
cynicism
there
never
was
a
special
day
of
damascus
in
my
life
i
always
had
as
it
were
two
souls
in
my
breast
the
one
which
she
hesitated
a
moment
well
which
you
know
and
another
which
craves
and
white
damask
and
so
on
that
the
reason
your
unsuspicious
loyalty
always
impressed
me
so
my
dear
you
probably
recollect
that
i
urged
you
to
cling
to
your
loyalty
through
thick
and
thin
because
you
ca
deny
it
it
the
crown
of
a
woman
life
that
just
what
i
said
do
you
remember
lilly
was
unable
to
recall
such
sentiments
but
she
did
recall
many
others
scarcely
harmonising
with
them
she
began
to
feel
quite
uneasy
her
friend
new
conception
of
life
seemed
ill
adapted
for
a
source
of
peace
to
her
in
the
joyful
stress
that
had
led
her
to
seek
sympathy
with
jula
well
to
continue
said
the
little
lady
i
was
always
able
to
sell
my
essays
and
novels
quickly
especially
if
i
took
them
to
the
editors
myself
and
i
found
i
was
on
the
road
to
accumulating
a
tidy
capital
my
became
little
more
than
an
ornament
that
the
beautiful
thing
about
virtue
for
the
person
who
understands
it
it
is
much
more
lucrative
than
sin
she
ran
her
little
red
tongue
over
her
lips
in
her
knowing
way
but
maintained
a
perfectly
demure
face
and
then
it
was
in
disposing
of
my
works
that
i
met
my
husband
to
be
you
know
i
at
last
divorced
from
that
old
horror
up
there
this
one
is
the
editor
of
a
new
magazine
for
women
it
stands
for
quiet
domesticity
and
already
has
very
good
advertisements
he
a
man
of
great
intellectual
gifts
and
very
firm
moral
principles
which
i
suppose
you
noticed
have
not
remained
without
influence
on
me
she
made
a
little
double
chin
and
folded
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
how
did
you
manage
to
separate
from
your
old
friend
asked
lilly
from
whose
mind
all
these
curious
facts
had
almost
driven
her
own
concerns
separate
what
are
you
thinking
of
rejoined
jula
beaming
again
with
sunny
foolishness
i
would
be
as
heartless
as
all
that
even
if
i
did
say
his
rôle
had
ended
you
not
to
take
it
so
literally
the
poor
dyspeptic
fellow
to
do
if
i
refuse
to
set
a
place
for
him
at
my
table
now
and
then
why
do
you
look
so
surprised
lilly
something
of
the
sort
can
always
be
managed
in
the
first
place
i
swore
to
my
betrothed
that
my
had
never
been
more
to
me
than
a
brotherly
friend
all
of
us
women
swear
such
things
and
do
even
blush
lilly
nodded
thoughtfully
that
evening
had
konrad
demanded
it
she
would
have
sworn
an
oath
without
a
moment
hesitation
in
the
second
place
i
telling
you
this
in
confidence
he
contributed
a
considerable
sum
toward
establishing
the
magazine
so
the
two
gentlemen
are
partners
i
arranged
matters
that
way
intentionally
because
it
seemed
to
me
the
best
guarantee
of
a
continuance
of
friendly
relations
do
make
such
large
eyes
dearie
life
is
made
up
of
compromises
every
bird
feathers
its
nest
and
if
you
think
i
afraid
of
disclosures
i
shrug
my
shoulders
tragedy
is
a
matter
of
taste
do
like
it
so
it
does
exist
for
me
i
always
say
to
myself
you
must
wear
a
smile
on
your
brow
but
beneath
the
smile
your
brow
must
be
of
iron
lilly
experienced
a
sickish
sensation
if
that
the
price
to
pay
for
uprooting
tragedy
from
one
life
she
thought
then
i
rather
have
unhappiness
i
can
swallow
it
than
all
this
happiness
she
rose
no
matter
how
high
above
her
this
woman
towered
in
force
of
intellect
and
will
no
matter
how
firmly
she
stood
on
the
ground
of
virtuous
life
she
was
no
longer
suited
to
be
lilly
friend
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
never
be
mistaken
in
your
confidence
said
lilly
jula
threw
up
her
hand
contemptuously
bah
she
said
men
a
man
who
knows
the
world
is
a
woman
eater
and
your
man
is
a
simpleton
i
can
always
get
along
with
both
classes
there
may
be
a
third
class
said
lilly
irritated
as
if
konrad
had
been
insulted
possibly
rejoined
jula
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
never
come
across
it
then
putting
both
hands
on
lilly
waist
tell
me
child
perfectly
frankly
if
you
look
at
me
this
way
and
compare
me
with
what
i
used
to
be
does
it
seem
to
you
that
i
posing
to
be
quite
candid
lilly
admitted
it
seemed
to
me
so
at
first
jula
sighed
it
very
hard
to
adapt
your
figure
to
a
dress
that
was
made
for
you
everybody
has
a
certain
moral
ambition
the
person
most
of
all
but
there
one
thing
i
love
to
know
what
is
really
the
more
valuable
in
me
my
former
sinning
or
my
present
virtue
she
smiled
up
at
lilly
with
a
melancholy
yet
sly
expression
this
time
lilly
did
not
respond
beyond
that
complacent
little
scatterbrain
her
own
happiness
rose
lofty
and
threatening
as
a
when
out
on
the
street
the
feeling
of
restless
isolation
took
stronger
hold
of
her
than
ever
yet
she
was
glad
she
had
not
spoken
she
knew
that
if
she
had
held
up
her
beloved
picture
to
jula
sly
understanding
it
would
have
come
back
to
her
desecrated
now
there
was
actually
not
a
soul
to
whom
she
could
pour
out
her
heart
a
few
days
later
in
glancing
over
the
paper
as
was
her
daily
habit
her
eyes
were
caught
by
a
sentence
which
suddenly
sent
a
ray
of
light
into
her
soul
joseph
chapel
müllerstrasse
evening
services
and
so
on
then
her
old
friend
was
still
alive
he
even
possessed
his
own
church
here
in
cold
heretical
berlin
in
all
the
years
she
had
been
in
berlin
she
had
not
entered
a
church
after
having
seated
herself
among
the
protestants
at
miss
von
schwertfeger
advice
she
had
felt
she
was
a
renegade
and
had
not
ventured
to
seek
solace
in
religion
and
now
she
was
an
atheist
but
the
name
joseph
in
the
paper
warmed
her
heart
she
felt
as
one
who
has
wandered
long
in
foreign
lands
and
suddenly
among
a
throng
of
strangers
beholds
a
dear
face
from
home
now
she
knew
to
whom
to
turn
without
fear
of
having
to
depart
misunderstood
and
unheard
even
if
the
great
scholars
had
done
away
with
him
a
thousand
times
he
still
existed
for
her
stupid
surcharged
heart
ready
to
receive
the
confession
of
her
happiness
müllerstrasse
was
somewhere
on
the
extreme
north
side
somewhere
around
her
green
grocer
to
whom
she
had
applied
informed
her
she
went
through
a
maze
of
streets
from
one
electric
tram
to
another
past
the
reichtags
buildings
the
lessing
theatre
and
the
stettin
station
along
the
endless
chaussé
beyond
the
weddingplatz
which
the
berlinese
consider
the
end
of
the
world
was
where
müllerstrasse
began
nobody
had
the
slightest
notion
of
where
a
joseph
chapel
was
not
even
dwellers
in
the
immediate
vicinity
finally
somebody
remembered
seeing
a
catholic
something
or
other
and
lilly
at
last
found
the
object
of
her
search
a
low
frame
structure
which
might
have
been
taken
for
a
barn
and
some
blossoming
trees
set
between
towering
tenements
the
side
door
was
open
pine
wreaths
said
welcome
lilly
saw
a
simple
white
hall
permeated
with
the
sepulchral
smell
of
incense
laurel
and
freshly
cut
pine
and
in
the
background
a
niche
decorated
to
resemble
the
starry
heavens
beyond
the
wooden
balustrade
separating
the
pictureless
shrine
of
the
high
altar
from
the
hall
rose
two
glorious
palms
the
low
rumble
of
an
organ
came
from
the
choir
the
organist
had
probably
stayed
after
the
funeral
to
dream
a
bit
in
suspense
lilly
glance
glided
along
the
walls
in
search
of
her
saint
abiding
place
was
he
smiling
and
holding
up
his
finger
here
too
with
the
same
benevolent
threatening
manner
as
the
good
old
uncle
in
anne
there
was
no
place
for
side
altars
the
space
was
completely
filled
with
benches
but
that
large
picture
there
in
the
garish
frame
with
a
beneath
covered
with
dusty
bouquets
she
saw
it
and
started
in
terror
her
saint
her
dear
beloved
saint
was
simply
ridiculous
he
had
a
face
with
a
golden
yellow
beard
and
eyes
cast
down
in
pious
modesty
and
he
was
smiling
mawkishly
the
infant
jesus
clad
in
pink
triumphed
on
his
left
arm
while
his
right
arm
gently
clasped
a
spray
of
lilies
lilly
disgust
turned
into
pity
how
remote
how
inconceivably
remote
was
that
world
in
which
one
implored
josephs
for
signs
of
favour
could
it
be
that
her
good
true
monitor
in
anne
had
been
just
as
comical
perish
the
thought
he
should
not
be
he
must
not
be
so
absurd
there
must
be
place
to
which
one
memory
could
travel
homeward
in
hours
of
pleasant
mourning
the
organ
was
playing
the
prelude
of
a
beautiful
mass
by
scarlatti
which
lilly
well
knew
from
of
old
gradually
she
began
to
feel
at
ease
she
kneeled
on
the
last
bench
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
imagine
that
instead
of
that
blond
caricature
her
old
friend
was
looking
down
upon
her
a
saying
of
thomas
aquinas
occurred
to
her
which
she
remembered
from
her
sunday
school
lessons
god
has
granted
other
saints
the
power
to
help
us
in
circumstances
to
joseph
he
has
granted
the
power
to
help
us
whatever
our
need
once
he
had
been
so
powerful
in
her
life
she
spoke
to
him
across
the
hundreds
of
miles
and
hundreds
of
years
that
separated
her
from
the
altar
in
anne
the
last
time
on
earth
she
was
fully
aware
there
was
no
longer
place
in
her
soul
for
such
childishness
and
just
because
it
was
her
farewell
she
told
him
without
reserve
of
her
great
experience
how
infinitely
happy
she
now
was
how
everything
that
had
lain
dead
within
her
blossomed
forth
with
fresh
life
and
how
the
entire
universe
was
one
great
symphony
of
joy
and
she
told
him
of
the
monstrous
deception
she
was
practising
and
her
fear
of
discovery
and
the
sweet
impatient
tremour
for
which
there
could
be
no
image
or
name
then
she
told
him
she
no
longer
believed
in
him
in
the
least
she
had
become
an
atheist
then
reconciled
she
laid
the
carnations
she
had
brought
along
for
the
poor
saint
among
the
dusty
bouquets
and
left
with
lightened
heart
smiling
at
the
spring
which
smiled
upon
her
beside
this
lilly
whom
the
stormy
wind
of
her
new
life
bore
aloft
to
the
heavens
far
above
all
earthly
hindrances
a
second
lilly
lived
who
spent
every
other
evening
with
her
old
friends
and
was
the
marvel
of
her
circle
because
of
her
triumphant
mood
her
merry
wit
the
youthful
liveliness
of
an
awakening
intellect
when
richard
came
for
his
afternoon
tea
he
met
with
daily
surprises
in
place
of
the
dragging
gloom
which
had
long
coloured
her
days
he
found
sprightliness
and
activity
a
creature
of
novelties
never
still
an
instant
though
now
and
then
abashed
at
his
inability
to
keep
pace
with
her
he
gladly
accustomed
himself
to
this
side
of
her
being
and
praised
the
magical
qualities
of
the
hæmatogen
which
the
physician
had
prescribed
that
spring
instead
of
the
usual
iron
the
same
scene
was
enacted
each
evening
that
richard
wanted
to
take
lilly
out
at
first
she
pleaded
a
cold
or
said
she
was
not
in
the
mood
for
meeting
people
but
once
she
had
consented
and
was
in
the
swing
she
played
with
her
admirers
as
with
puppies
and
awed
the
ladies
by
telling
them
things
to
their
faces
sometimes
to
be
sure
she
sat
as
formerly
absorbed
in
dreamy
silence
though
now
if
anyone
attempted
to
liven
her
up
she
no
longer
blushed
and
suffered
herself
to
be
teased
without
an
attempt
at
she
paid
back
every
intruder
with
such
prompt
haughty
satire
that
the
men
soon
found
it
wiser
to
leave
her
to
herself
in
all
this
time
she
drank
herself
into
a
state
of
exaltation
only
once
and
that
on
the
day
on
which
at
last
she
decided
to
tell
richard
of
the
existence
of
her
new
friend
she
had
wrestled
with
herself
for
two
months
sometime
or
other
it
had
to
be
she
knew
for
what
if
they
were
seen
together
but
since
she
could
not
decide
in
what
form
to
clothe
the
avowal
she
had
deferred
it
from
day
to
day
chance
helped
her
out
of
the
dilemma
one
day
richard
in
order
to
obtain
her
judgment
brought
along
some
sketches
of
vases
which
had
been
submitted
to
him
for
purchase
on
leaving
he
forgot
to
take
them
along
konrad
happened
to
see
them
and
in
a
few
rapid
strokes
drew
the
outline
which
corresponded
to
the
original
draught
and
which
the
artist
in
developing
the
plan
had
failed
to
insert
the
next
day
when
richard
saw
the
work
he
looked
at
lilly
in
astonishment
the
corrections
were
splendid
who
had
made
them
lilly
still
suffering
from
the
intimidation
induced
by
her
bungled
work
on
the
transparencies
did
not
dare
to
tell
him
she
herself
had
so
taking
heart
she
said
my
teacher
who
giving
me
lessons
in
the
history
of
art
since
when
i
like
to
know
asked
richard
his
eyes
growing
round
and
severe
in
her
great
embarrassment
she
took
to
scolding
as
best
or
as
worst
she
knew
how
do
you
think
i
can
stand
such
a
dull
inane
idle
existence
do
you
think
it
a
crime
for
an
unoccupied
young
woman
to
strive
for
a
bit
of
culture
do
you
think
i
be
a
better
friend
if
i
could
keep
pace
with
you
and
other
clever
people
than
if
i
go
to
my
ruin
jabbering
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
dressing
myself
up
for
show
and
behaving
like
any
silly
thing
the
turn
about
clever
people
flattered
him
all
very
well
and
good
he
replied
more
mildly
but
why
did
you
tell
me
before
she
concocted
a
long
story
about
three
months
before
she
had
read
an
advertisement
in
the
in
which
a
young
scholar
offered
his
services
to
gentlemen
and
ladies
possessed
of
a
thirst
for
knowledge
she
wrote
to
the
scholar
he
came
and
the
lessons
began
pupil
and
teacher
had
grown
to
be
friends
though
their
friendship
of
course
was
of
a
purely
ideal
nature
she
dreaded
awakening
richard
jealousy
so
she
had
decided
not
to
tell
him
until
time
should
prove
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
absolute
purity
of
her
endeavours
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
and
a
cunning
grin
inexplicable
to
lilly
played
about
his
mouth
so
your
friend
a
young
scholar
he
asked
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
looked
at
her
sidewise
his
head
inclined
entirely
to
the
left
yes
he
going
to
be
i
suppose
he
not
quite
certain
but
he
probably
will
and
i
suppose
he
highly
intellectual
and
scintillating
and
superior
she
turned
her
eyes
heavenward
i
never
in
my
life
met
a
man
who
she
stopped
in
fright
it
was
scarcely
the
better
part
of
wisdom
to
give
reins
to
her
enthusiasm
hm
hm
he
said
as
one
who
finds
long
harboured
suspicions
confirmed
his
face
was
quite
red
and
he
gnawed
the
ends
of
his
moustache
i
knew
it
cried
lilly
you
jealous
after
all
she
felt
as
if
a
bitter
injustice
were
being
done
her
he
said
nothing
more
and
left
lowering
an
hour
later
a
package
from
liebert
dehnicke
was
left
at
the
door
lilly
opened
it
and
found
it
contained
a
man
suit
which
she
recognised
as
one
richard
had
frequently
worn
the
previous
summer
a
letter
accompanied
the
package
dearest
lilly
as
i
promised
you
that
time
i
shall
always
be
ready
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
your
affinities
with
old
clothes
to
further
their
progress
i
shall
also
be
glad
to
provide
them
with
old
boots
you
see
how
jealous
i
am
your
richard
in
the
exuberance
of
her
delight
lilly
drank
to
excess
that
evening
never
not
even
when
she
had
danced
for
salmoni
had
she
allowed
her
imitative
faculties
such
full
play
she
was
in
a
state
of
mad
in
conclusion
she
danced
on
the
tops
of
the
tables
set
close
together
a
wild
salome
dance
which
had
just
then
come
into
fashion
between
her
clenched
teeth
she
zimmed
strange
oriental
melodies
what
that
she
mumbling
the
spectators
asked
later
they
put
the
question
to
her
but
she
had
lost
her
senses
she
was
unconscious
chapter
xv
the
peaceful
golden
light
of
a
sunday
morning
in
june
pierced
the
railroad
station
sooty
glass
roof
such
an
amount
of
blush
brightness
was
gathered
under
the
three
great
arches
where
they
led
into
the
open
that
as
the
train
glided
beneath
them
you
thought
you
were
dipping
into
a
sunny
sea
the
gay
ribbons
of
the
girls
fluttered
against
the
decent
sunday
suits
of
the
attentive
youths
each
of
whom
felt
himself
to
be
an
indispensable
master
of
ceremonies
there
were
athletic
clubs
and
rowing
clubs
and
smoking
clubs
and
singing
societies
and
an
entire
department
store
in
the
midst
of
the
jolly
noisy
throng
a
quiet
happy
couple
walked
along
looking
about
cautiously
and
keeping
at
a
certain
distance
from
each
other
so
that
nobody
could
be
sure
whether
or
not
they
belonged
together
they
made
for
one
of
the
front
coaches
lilly
walked
ahead
again
she
saw
the
faces
of
persons
coming
toward
her
grow
rigid
with
a
sort
of
solemn
tenseness
a
mute
homage
which
she
well
knew
but
which
she
had
never
accepted
with
so
much
joy
as
then
since
the
one
man
in
the
world
whom
she
wanted
to
please
was
witnessing
her
triumph
in
his
honour
she
had
clad
herself
completely
in
festive
white
a
linen
crash
suit
an
embroidered
linen
blouse
and
a
white
straw
hat
with
a
white
veil
about
it
she
wore
the
hat
low
on
her
forehead
and
beneath
it
her
shining
brown
hair
rolled
in
large
waves
she
carried
a
white
zephyr
shawl
on
her
arm
against
the
evening
coolness
since
they
had
arranged
not
to
try
to
catch
a
certain
train
home
but
remain
in
the
country
until
they
wearied
they
sat
in
opposite
corners
of
the
compartment
smiling
slyly
and
saying
not
a
word
they
were
riding
into
the
unknown
follow
me
he
had
said
i
give
you
a
surprise
we
will
go
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
i
myself
am
by
no
means
certain
of
my
goal
otherwise
it
would
be
a
voyage
of
discovery
the
feeling
of
giving
herself
up
without
question
was
new
and
delicious
about
an
hour
must
have
passed
and
the
compartment
had
long
been
empty
when
he
nodded
to
her
to
get
out
where
are
we
what
difference
does
it
make
where
we
are
oh
he
was
right
lilly
never
so
much
as
glanced
at
the
name
of
the
station
they
walked
along
the
uneven
street
of
a
bare
little
town
the
sunshine
lay
on
the
yellow
house
fronts
like
a
soporific
the
shop
doors
were
locked
and
sheets
were
stretched
across
the
lower
halves
of
the
display
windows
to
proclaim
the
sunday
organ
tones
came
from
around
the
street
corners
like
a
dull
breeze
a
turkey
cock
strutted
up
from
out
of
a
gateway
and
gobbled
at
them
no
more
organ
tones
the
houses
grew
less
frequent
from
the
fields
came
a
whiff
of
ripening
grain
but
the
heavy
fragrance
of
the
yellow
lupine
overwhelmed
it
meadows
of
clover
spread
their
rugs
and
in
the
background
black
firs
rose
from
the
summits
of
hills
they
stepped
merrily
along
the
unshaded
road
on
which
little
eddies
of
silvery
white
dust
chased
ahead
of
them
konrad
knew
and
saw
everything
how
the
falcon
flapping
its
wings
stood
still
in
the
air
how
the
wild
rabbit
lifting
its
little
white
rump
leapt
away
in
droll
haste
every
minute
there
was
something
new
since
the
days
at
lischnitz
lilly
had
never
walked
out
in
the
blossoming
spring
oh
if
i
had
had
a
guide
like
him
she
thought
it
would
all
have
been
so
different
in
the
pine
woods
which
gave
out
a
hot
breath
a
squirrel
ran
past
them
almost
over
their
feet
shot
up
a
tree
trunk
and
at
about
a
height
from
the
ground
stood
still
as
if
turned
to
stone
lilly
and
konrad
looked
at
each
other
mindful
of
the
moment
they
had
first
met
lilly
moved
up
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
squirrel
but
it
did
not
budge
i
feel
as
if
we
were
enchanted
she
said
if
it
were
to
speak
to
us
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
heaving
a
sigh
of
bliss
she
threw
herself
on
the
grey
crackling
moss
konrad
followed
her
example
shading
their
eyes
with
their
hands
they
lay
on
their
backs
and
blinked
up
at
the
sun
which
flickered
down
on
them
through
the
sparse
fir
boughs
they
had
both
nearly
forgotten
the
squirrel
presence
when
a
sudden
chip
sounded
close
over
their
heads
they
looked
up
and
saw
the
little
fellow
scampering
up
the
trunk
until
that
moment
he
had
stared
at
them
too
frightened
to
stir
there
you
have
it
said
konrad
if
we
shoot
our
human
language
at
them
they
take
good
care
not
to
speak
to
us
we
enchanted
at
any
rate
laughed
lilly
i
at
least
have
never
in
my
life
been
stretched
out
so
comfortably
and
had
the
sun
shine
on
me
so
have
you
oh
yes
he
rejoined
i
recall
one
time
at
least
quite
definitely
how
when
lilly
inquired
all
jealousy
she
was
jealous
of
every
happy
moment
in
his
life
which
she
had
not
created
for
him
oh
there
not
much
to
tell
it
was
in
ravello
a
rocky
nest
not
far
from
amalfi
high
over
the
sea
a
perfect
fairyland
full
of
old
moorish
palaces
partly
inhabited
partly
in
ruins
there
are
marble
courtyards
with
trellised
iron
railings
ruined
fountains
with
myrtle
and
laurel
growing
around
in
rank
profusion
and
little
white
climbing
roses
covering
everything
there
was
one
place
in
particular
which
i
would
have
given
my
life
to
be
able
to
enter
it
had
a
small
mysterious
gallery
which
stood
out
against
the
deep
blue
sky
like
a
silver
web
an
iron
gate
as
high
as
a
house
separated
me
from
that
gallery
since
there
was
nobody
about
to
see
the
street
arab
escapade
only
a
few
peasant
labourers
in
the
olive
plantations
live
there
i
actually
climbed
over
that
gate
one
day
glorious
cried
lilly
yes
i
got
in
after
making
a
professional
inspection
of
the
beautiful
strange
motifs
i
lay
a
long
time
on
the
warm
stone
steps
and
let
the
sun
shine
down
on
me
just
as
we
are
doing
now
under
these
brandenburg
firs
and
think
of
it
the
little
lizards
that
you
love
so
came
gliding
up
slowly
cautiously
and
ran
straight
over
me
oh
heavenly
said
lilly
rapturously
lying
there
that
way
with
the
old
marble
fountain
making
music
in
my
ears
i
fell
asleep
a
thing
one
had
better
not
indulge
in
because
one
may
get
a
sunstroke
that
way
even
in
midwinter
i
sure
i
should
have
if
some
tourists
had
come
along
and
thrown
sticks
and
stones
at
me
when
i
awoke
i
felt
dizzy
and
i
saw
red
i
could
dream
of
climbing
over
the
gate
again
the
tourists
had
to
fetch
the
gate
key
from
the
sindaco
and
to
cap
the
climax
i
had
to
appear
before
him
for
a
hearing
who
are
you
do
you
know
trespassing
in
the
garden
is
forbidden
but
thank
the
lord
he
did
send
me
to
jail
because
all
the
people
tapped
their
heads
and
said
he
crazy
no
harm
laughed
lilly
you
got
what
you
wanted
you
entered
the
forbidden
garden
other
people
have
to
be
content
with
standing
outside
the
railing
a
pleasure
we
shall
probably
enjoy
he
observed
and
lilly
choked
down
her
curiosity
at
any
rate
he
continued
it
does
hurt
if
one
practices
standing
outside
now
and
then
heaven
knows
the
very
happiness
toward
which
you
crane
your
neck
usually
is
a
forbidden
garden
lilly
looked
at
him
what
did
he
mean
by
that
their
eyes
met
in
shy
understanding
that
hopeful
disquiet
which
she
did
not
venture
to
call
by
its
name
quivered
through
her
like
a
fit
of
fever
come
she
said
jumping
to
her
feet
and
hurrying
on
without
looking
back
at
him
the
woods
grew
thinner
they
now
walked
along
a
thicketed
swamp
where
birches
gaily
shot
up
their
slender
white
columns
from
mossy
pediments
the
warm
noon
air
vibrated
in
wavelets
from
somewhere
came
the
sound
of
a
church
bell
but
no
farmyard
was
visible
far
or
near
and
suddenly
they
struck
a
and
did
not
know
which
way
to
go
we
are
called
upon
to
decide
he
said
and
listened
a
while
in
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
of
the
bell
came
then
he
turned
to
the
right
i
wish
he
went
on
i
wish
there
were
a
bell
to
sound
the
way
for
me
in
life
then
he
told
her
he
was
standing
at
a
he
had
been
offered
a
position
which
in
view
of
his
youth
was
not
of
slight
importance
but
before
accepting
it
he
had
to
make
sure
whether
at
the
same
time
he
could
continue
with
his
it
must
be
a
very
high
position
is
it
lilly
asked
proudly
had
the
world
felt
impelled
to
make
him
minister
of
fine
arts
or
emperor
of
china
she
would
not
have
been
a
bit
surprised
but
he
hesitated
to
reply
and
finally
said
i
rather
tell
you
about
it
when
it
all
settled
she
had
to
be
content
roofs
gleaming
red
crept
over
the
tops
of
the
bushes
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
sparkled
a
lake
nothing
more
at
that
distance
than
a
fine
silver
thread
is
that
it
asked
lilly
possibly
oh
do
put
on
such
a
mysterious
air
she
rebuked
him
teasingly
up
to
now
i
been
very
good
and
have
asked
a
single
question
but
do
at
last
tell
what
you
have
up
your
sleeve
afterwards
when
we
there
he
laughed
i
know
you
i
like
to
make
you
jealous
before
the
time
ripe
oh
if
a
woman
in
the
case
another
woman
she
gave
no
outer
signs
of
her
emotion
but
as
she
walked
along
she
felt
quite
ill
partly
from
hunger
partly
from
distress
the
lake
in
its
light
blue
summer
beauty
now
lay
before
them
with
its
girdle
of
reeds
and
its
glistening
play
of
light
not
far
from
the
bank
on
an
eminence
encircled
with
bushes
stood
an
inn
a
atrocity
built
in
that
barbarous
style
for
frame
houses
between
a
palace
and
a
barn
but
three
or
four
ancient
lindens
surrounded
the
inn
and
the
white
benches
beneath
offered
pleasant
seats
according
with
and
konrad
mood
to
the
left
the
lake
stretched
into
the
hazy
distance
to
the
right
beyond
the
reeds
in
the
cove
lay
a
peasant
village
with
its
mossy
green
thatched
roofs
and
its
blunt
spire
half
hidden
in
the
bushes
and
reeds
and
nearby
only
a
few
hundred
feet
away
rose
the
mighty
trees
of
a
park
from
the
interior
of
which
here
and
there
came
a
gleam
of
columns
and
bridges
and
white
walls
probably
the
forbidden
garden
in
front
of
whose
railing
she
was
to
stand
that
day
how
beautiful
and
how
mysterious
anglers
came
up
from
the
lake
red
as
lobsters
and
panting
with
thirst
the
sole
guests
it
seemed
besides
lilly
and
konrad
the
stream
of
sunday
excursionists
had
not
yet
flowed
into
that
quiet
corner
but
the
bill
of
fare
offered
a
dizzying
abundance
of
good
things
too
bad
they
had
come
all
at
once
the
landlady
who
handed
them
the
card
with
smiling
obsequiousness
was
an
artful
city
product
konrad
wanted
lilly
to
arrange
the
menu
but
she
refused
the
thought
of
the
woman
in
the
case
oppressed
her
sorely
and
as
through
a
dark
veil
she
looked
on
the
laughing
world
which
willingly
threw
its
early
summer
treasures
at
their
feet
at
last
we
here
she
said
sighing
now
do
confess
what
sort
of
a
woman
is
she
he
burst
out
laughing
so
you
know
there
a
woman
in
the
case
what
else
would
make
me
jealous
she
has
the
right
to
make
you
jealous
i
must
say
i
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
in
my
life
it
a
pity
she
of
marble
oh
if
that
was
all
i
am
and
always
will
be
a
goose
laughed
lilly
and
he
kissed
her
hand
in
apology
while
awaiting
the
fish
they
had
ordered
he
told
her
the
history
that
led
up
to
their
present
pilgrimage
in
rome
he
had
once
noticed
an
antique
bust
of
a
woman
in
an
art
dealer
show
window
the
head
was
badly
mutilated
but
of
such
lofty
sombre
beauty
that
he
kept
returning
to
the
window
to
feast
his
eyes
upon
it
one
day
he
found
the
dealer
and
a
german
gentleman
engaged
in
an
eager
conversation
which
however
never
progressed
because
the
two
did
not
understand
each
other
he
offered
his
services
as
interpreter
and
to
his
dismay
learned
that
his
beloved
was
being
bargained
for
the
german
was
a
baron
courteous
and
evidently
a
man
of
some
culture
in
defiance
of
his
own
feelings
konrad
tried
his
best
to
arrange
the
sale
and
for
his
pains
received
an
invitation
to
view
the
bust
in
the
park
he
was
to
convince
himself
that
the
beautiful
head
was
destined
for
no
unworthy
setting
why
then
it
not
a
forbidden
garden
after
all
cried
lilly
blissfully
stretching
her
arms
toward
the
mysterious
green
walls
we
have
the
right
to
enter
it
but
konrad
looked
thoughtful
it
not
so
simple
as
all
that
remember
as
what
shall
i
introduce
you
you
not
my
wife
i
ca
say
you
my
sister
as
you
and
i
pretend
and
we
both
too
young
for
any
other
relationship
a
sudden
bitterness
welled
up
within
her
again
she
felt
scorned
outlawed
expelled
from
the
community
of
the
virtuous
you
should
have
left
me
at
home
she
burst
out
i
nothing
but
a
burden
to
you
oh
lilly
he
said
what
do
i
care
for
all
the
marble
women
in
the
world
i
rather
stand
outside
with
you
than
be
shown
the
honours
of
the
entire
place
reconciled
and
grateful
she
stroked
his
hand
hanging
at
his
side
at
this
point
at
last
the
carp
was
served
two
hours
later
they
were
walking
along
an
endless
wall
about
nine
feet
high
with
never
a
break
in
it
to
peep
through
but
at
the
corner
of
the
park
to
the
right
the
wall
came
to
an
end
giving
place
to
a
high
mossy
wooden
fence
which
allowed
them
a
view
some
distance
into
the
interior
ancient
plane
trees
arched
over
shady
nooks
with
lindens
and
elms
forcing
themselves
between
vines
with
great
violet
eyes
draped
the
open
grassy
places
in
the
background
on
a
hillock
about
which
towered
sombre
spruces
stood
a
small
solemn
round
temple
with
tuscan
columns
and
a
gleaming
green
roof
she
must
be
in
there
said
konrad
but
the
temple
was
empty
so
they
continued
their
search
not
a
single
opening
in
the
foliage
escaped
them
here
something
gleamed
and
there
and
there
a
ceres
a
satyr
blowing
his
pipe
of
pan
in
a
cypress
thicket
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
wayside
shrine
of
our
lady
but
the
woman
head
they
were
seeking
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
they
walked
on
a
stream
flowing
from
within
the
park
crossed
the
road
an
unsightly
plank
bridge
such
as
is
to
be
seen
on
every
highway
led
across
but
a
few
hundred
feet
away
inside
the
park
another
bridge
boldly
yet
gracefully
threw
its
shining
white
arch
over
the
running
water
the
bridges
in
venice
look
like
that
he
said
that
is
the
way
the
gods
went
to
walhalla
she
said
with
a
sigh
they
stopped
and
pictured
the
delights
of
crossing
that
bridge
still
nothing
to
be
seen
of
their
marble
bust
beyond
the
plank
bridge
where
the
village
began
the
park
receded
some
distance
from
the
road
a
row
of
tall
serious
weymouth
pines
ran
along
the
other
side
of
the
fence
the
village
street
was
gay
with
sunday
life
the
sound
of
a
piano
and
a
fiddle
came
from
a
dancing
hall
interrupted
every
now
and
then
by
the
roll
of
bowling
balls
lilly
and
her
friend
passed
without
giving
heed
to
these
things
their
wishes
were
still
fastened
upon
the
forbidden
garden
each
moment
increased
their
longing
hidden
between
the
village
lindens
crouched
crumbling
stone
posts
to
which
the
decaying
fence
pales
clung
with
difficulty
here
the
foliage
in
the
interior
was
impenetrable
to
the
eye
ivy
and
clematis
serpentined
from
trunk
to
trunk
and
lilacs
and
spiræas
grew
in
rank
profusion
between
the
lord
of
the
garden
seemed
to
have
drawn
an
inner
living
hedge
about
himself
and
his
companions
to
conceal
them
in
laughing
seclusion
once
more
they
walked
along
in
vain
endeavouring
to
get
a
peep
into
the
interior
presently
they
came
upon
an
ancient
gate
which
with
its
vases
and
columns
its
cracked
belfry
and
its
lace
work
was
half
sunk
in
blooming
acacias
here
at
last
they
could
get
a
good
view
of
the
park
in
sombre
solemnity
tall
pines
led
straight
to
the
castle
but
even
here
they
were
unable
to
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
buildings
which
probably
stood
off
to
one
side
hidden
behind
trees
and
bushes
the
only
architectural
bit
their
searching
eyes
discerned
was
a
columned
terrace
where
cherubs
fluttered
their
snowy
white
wings
oh
how
beautiful
sighed
lilly
and
pressing
her
face
between
the
iron
bars
she
jestingly
whined
and
begged
to
be
let
in
that
just
the
way
i
stood
outside
the
gate
in
ravello
now
you
know
what
it
like
his
words
brought
to
lilly
the
realisation
that
she
had
long
known
what
it
was
like
she
was
familiar
with
the
feeling
she
had
often
stood
in
the
very
same
position
but
where
where
where
had
cold
iron
pressed
her
cheeks
just
as
now
oh
yes
many
and
many
a
time
she
had
stood
at
the
iron
grating
of
the
door
leading
to
dehnicke
staircase
that
proud
staircase
which
her
desecrated
feet
were
never
to
tread
that
too
was
a
forbidden
garden
forbidden
gardens
everywhere
should
we
go
she
asked
softly
it
will
simply
depress
us
to
remain
here
hand
in
hand
they
returned
the
entire
distance
they
had
come
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
the
enclosure
and
speaking
of
anything
but
their
hearts
desire
nevertheless
their
eyes
remained
fastened
on
the
goal
of
their
aspirations
and
the
yearning
they
both
felt
though
neither
of
them
would
express
it
for
fear
of
hinting
reproaches
threw
a
fairy
film
of
gold
over
the
universe
evening
came
violet
shadows
lay
upon
the
meadows
the
coppery
pine
trunks
glowed
like
torches
as
the
sinking
sun
dipped
into
the
reeds
the
lake
lost
its
cool
blue
silvery
sheen
and
adorned
itself
with
a
net
of
reddish
gold
it
looked
as
if
it
had
sportively
drawn
to
itself
the
fulfilment
of
all
earthly
promises
the
two
could
no
longer
bear
it
on
land
down
at
the
bathing
pavilion
where
a
merry
lot
of
people
were
splashing
about
in
the
evening
coolness
there
was
a
boat
to
be
hired
for
very
little
konrad
took
the
oars
and
lilly
seated
herself
at
the
tiller
water
plants
plashed
lightly
against
the
sides
of
the
boat
and
the
bow
cut
through
a
waving
carpet
of
pollen
among
this
year
tender
green
reeds
stood
the
remnants
of
last
year
growth
dark
bulrushes
edged
the
shores
and
the
planted
its
golden
tents
between
over
the
reeds
and
bulrushes
they
could
see
the
massed
park
trees
rising
toward
the
heavens
like
purple
walls
when
lilly
told
him
to
look
there
he
observed
indifferently
oh
no
use
it
out
of
the
question
nevertheless
he
continued
to
cast
sidelong
glances
that
way
lilly
in
her
slight
experience
with
boats
did
not
know
how
to
manage
the
tiller
and
after
trying
a
while
she
threw
the
rope
down
and
spread
her
white
shawl
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
to
make
a
cosy
nest
for
herself
she
lay
crouched
at
konrad
feet
with
her
back
to
the
seat
in
the
stern
and
with
her
eyes
lost
in
the
blue
depths
she
began
to
plan
a
different
future
some
way
of
saving
herself
by
a
desperate
leap
into
the
land
of
the
virtuous
she
would
give
music
lessons
her
knowledge
sufficed
for
beginners
and
with
her
savings
prepare
for
the
stage
for
which
her
talents
eminently
fitted
her
or
better
still
take
up
scientific
studies
because
she
must
keep
intellectual
pace
with
him
she
must
be
a
suitable
friend
so
long
as
he
needed
her
friendship
or
not
to
wound
the
sensibilities
of
others
she
would
leave
germany
earn
her
living
as
a
teacher
of
german
and
when
he
should
summon
her
return
a
new
purified
being
or
oh
dear
or
to
lie
and
dream
and
drink
the
cup
of
her
present
joy
to
the
dregs
discovery
and
death
the
one
involved
the
other
would
come
soon
enough
the
sun
dissolved
behind
a
curtain
violet
vapours
closed
down
enveloping
things
far
and
near
the
entire
world
seemed
to
have
thinned
into
light
and
air
the
reeds
alone
with
their
slender
black
stalks
standing
out
against
the
evening
glow
like
a
dainty
railing
of
wrought
iron
retained
their
corporeal
aspect
the
foliage
of
the
park
slowly
melted
into
a
mass
of
darkness
now
the
park
seemed
to
be
doubly
a
forbidden
garden
filled
to
the
brim
with
thrills
and
mysteries
sunk
forever
in
the
realm
of
the
unattainable
as
the
boat
glided
slowly
along
the
edge
of
the
reeds
a
blue
cove
suddenly
opened
up
making
a
cut
into
the
land
on
the
park
side
it
seemed
to
continue
inward
without
end
for
a
few
moments
konrad
remained
motionless
his
oars
suspended
then
he
jumped
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
what
the
matter
what
the
matter
you
remember
the
stream
flowing
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
park
certainly
it
must
have
flowed
in
somewhere
eh
of
course
he
pointed
to
the
gleaming
tip
of
the
cove
there
it
is
you
think
we
shall
after
all
the
thought
was
too
bold
for
utterance
now
by
water
in
this
boat
we
shall
cross
that
whole
dark
region
from
one
side
to
the
other
in
her
rapture
she
jumped
up
with
a
little
outcry
of
delight
and
fell
upon
his
neck
naturally
as
if
they
had
never
exchanged
vows
and
pledges
the
boat
gradually
slipped
into
the
current
and
floated
between
meadows
set
with
willows
where
the
evening
mist
lay
like
white
swathes
beyond
stood
gleaming
peasant
huts
and
fishing
nets
draped
the
fences
then
at
a
bend
in
the
stream
a
mighty
arch
of
foliage
opened
up
before
them
o
lord
cried
lilly
psst
we
must
keep
very
quiet
now
he
said
else
we
be
turned
out
after
all
he
dipped
his
oars
so
lightly
that
the
sound
might
have
been
taken
for
the
splash
of
a
leaping
fish
he
rowed
through
the
gate
of
leaves
under
branches
joined
overhead
in
a
mazy
thicket
it
was
dark
as
night
in
this
spot
though
here
and
there
on
the
right
a
gleam
of
the
summer
twilight
pierced
through
the
foliage
they
also
caught
a
glimpse
of
lights
and
heard
talk
and
laughter
and
the
sound
of
clinking
glasses
and
intermittently
a
chord
as
if
someone
in
the
midst
of
conversation
carelessly
ran
his
hand
over
the
keys
here
the
trees
and
bushes
were
wider
apart
and
they
had
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
castle
a
broad
building
its
ponderous
simplicity
pointed
to
the
time
when
the
grandees
of
brandenburg
had
not
yet
possessed
a
feeling
for
art
but
on
the
terrace
were
the
cherubs
who
had
greeted
them
from
a
distance
in
the
afternoon
between
their
white
bodies
at
a
long
table
in
the
flickering
lamplight
sat
a
chattering
laughing
singing
company
apparently
drinking
in
the
intoxication
of
the
summer
evening
with
their
wine
he
too
might
be
sitting
there
if
i
were
a
about
his
neck
thought
lilly
and
she
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
the
current
carried
the
boat
on
the
banquet
scene
vanished
like
the
vision
of
a
moment
passing
that
end
of
the
castle
in
which
the
kitchen
and
pantries
lay
where
ministering
spirits
ran
busily
to
and
fro
they
dipped
once
more
into
silence
and
darkness
to
the
right
of
them
back
of
the
edifice
was
a
lawn
with
old
statues
and
urns
to
the
left
a
world
buried
in
darkness
a
line
of
lindens
hundreds
of
years
old
bordered
the
stream
and
stifled
every
ray
of
light
in
its
dark
halls
perhaps
this
was
where
the
marble
bust
was
hidden
lilly
peered
into
every
recess
though
furtively
so
as
to
reserve
the
pleasure
of
discovery
for
him
they
now
approached
the
daintily
arched
bridge
they
had
seen
from
afar
in
the
daytime
it
did
not
lead
to
walhalla
but
from
a
spiræa
bush
to
a
hemp
bush
and
beneath
it
slept
a
pair
of
swans
who
awoke
at
the
stroke
of
the
oars
and
with
outspread
wings
swam
behind
the
boat
begging
for
bread
swans
the
one
thing
lacking
lilly
rejoiced
softly
and
sought
in
vain
for
a
crumb
she
turned
to
look
after
the
swans
and
her
neck
touched
his
knees
may
i
stay
this
way
she
asked
a
little
anxiously
if
you
comfortable
he
answered
there
was
a
yielding
tone
in
his
voice
which
ran
warm
through
her
body
she
unpinned
her
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
back
seat
now
she
was
free
to
lean
her
head
lightly
against
him
with
sweet
alarm
she
felt
his
hand
quietly
stroke
her
head
but
he
seemed
taciturn
and
as
if
a
burden
were
weighing
upon
him
which
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
shoulder
and
again
she
felt
as
ofttimes
that
a
veil
hung
between
them
a
veil
seldom
lifted
aside
which
obscured
the
true
features
of
his
being
no
matter
how
closely
her
love
drew
her
to
him
oh
if
only
he
were
gay
the
park
came
to
an
end
the
red
evening
glow
no
longer
shadowed
by
a
mass
of
foliage
shone
upon
them
insistently
the
magic
spell
threatened
to
be
broken
the
world
took
on
its
ordinary
aspect
come
turn
she
asked
softly
he
rowed
back
again
into
the
blissful
night
now
he
had
to
strive
against
the
current
and
could
not
avoid
the
sound
of
splashing
if
only
they
do
catch
us
he
said
oh
they
are
too
happy
rejoined
lilly
they
would
do
anything
to
a
happy
person
it
seems
almost
like
an
enchanted
castle
but
who
can
tell
it
may
be
a
delusion
why
oh
the
most
grievous
wound
may
be
hidden
under
powers
and
many
a
man
hides
himself
behind
beauty
because
he
has
buried
his
powers
the
doubt
displeased
lilly
but
they
should
be
happy
she
exclaimed
softly
those
who
can
spare
so
much
as
they
have
given
us
have
enough
left
for
themselves
illogical
conclusion
darling
he
replied
you
can
enrich
a
beggar
and
still
remain
as
poor
as
a
are
beggars
she
asked
raising
herself
up
to
him
tenderly
no
by
god
we
are
beggars
he
replied
drawing
a
deep
breath
there
was
silence
for
a
time
then
it
seemed
to
lilly
something
warm
and
moist
fell
upon
her
forehead
for
god
sake
he
was
crying
crying
with
happiness
how
had
she
deserved
it
she
lilly
czepanek
she
to
hide
her
own
tears
she
crouched
down
again
it
was
in
overflowing
measure
unendurable
she
wanted
to
sob
cry
aloud
kiss
his
hands
yet
she
was
forced
to
clench
her
fists
and
stuff
her
gloves
between
her
teeth
to
keep
him
from
seeing
what
was
going
on
within
her
it
was
a
that
as
they
slowly
approached
the
castle
again
the
sound
of
a
woman
singing
reached
them
full
ringing
tones
which
in
the
ascending
notes
struck
her
heart
like
a
lash
what
was
she
singing
was
it
from
tristan
lilly
had
never
heard
the
opera
but
it
could
only
be
from
tristan
she
raised
her
head
questioningly
isolde
konrad
whispered
in
her
ear
he
turned
the
boat
toward
the
shore
in
the
deepest
darkness
they
must
not
lose
a
note
up
there
on
the
terrace
the
laughing
and
talking
had
ceased
the
nightingale
alone
in
the
linden
thicket
would
not
be
silenced
and
mingled
its
sweet
ecstasy
with
the
exultation
in
death
of
the
woman
who
like
no
other
creation
of
god
or
man
teaches
us
that
the
desire
not
to
be
is
the
most
exalted
affirmation
of
to
be
lilly
her
whole
body
quivering
put
her
hand
over
her
shoulder
to
grasp
his
she
had
to
hold
on
to
him
otherwise
she
felt
she
would
sink
into
the
void
she
did
not
grow
easier
until
she
felt
his
warm
fingers
between
hers
the
song
ended
the
mighty
arpeggios
of
the
accompaniment
died
away
there
was
no
applause
each
of
the
merry
guests
had
realised
his
indebtedness
to
the
occasion
konrad
pressed
her
hand
and
withdrew
his
and
took
up
the
oars
again
the
forbidden
garden
began
to
disappear
the
reddish
dusk
of
night
lay
upon
the
meadows
not
sound
far
or
near
nevertheless
the
world
seemed
filled
with
the
music
of
harps
and
ringing
songs
we
have
your
marble
woman
lilly
whispered
stroking
his
knees
but
i
keep
thinking
that
was
her
voice
i
too
he
burst
out
passionately
and
she
was
singing
for
the
good
folk
up
there
but
just
for
us
oh
if
only
i
could
sing
it
like
her
sighed
lilly
try
she
remembered
bits
here
and
there
but
was
unable
to
gather
them
into
a
whole
besides
something
else
forced
its
way
between
which
now
gushed
up
mightier
than
all
else
with
the
song
of
songs
of
the
greatest
and
richest
her
own
poor
song
of
songs
mingled
undesired
uncalled
and
she
sang
into
the
deep
silence
tell
me
o
thou
whom
my
soul
loveth
where
thou
feedest
where
lettest
thou
thy
flock
rest
at
noon
for
why
should
i
appear
like
a
vailed
mourner
she
stopped
what
is
that
he
asked
i
do
know
it
at
all
it
is
my
song
of
songs
she
rejoined
fetching
a
deep
breath
never
before
had
she
uttered
the
name
to
a
human
being
your
song
of
songs
he
asked
bewildered
lilly
realised
an
hour
like
this
would
never
come
again
it
was
the
moment
to
confide
to
him
the
secret
of
her
youth
drop
the
oars
and
listen
i
will
tell
you
something
it
may
sound
silly
and
stupid
to
you
but
to
me
it
was
always
like
something
sacred
without
speaking
he
laid
the
oars
down
you
must
sit
next
to
me
she
said
so
i
can
look
at
you
he
cast
a
searching
glance
in
all
directions
the
boat
had
long
been
quietly
drifting
again
on
the
lake
upon
which
all
the
light
of
the
summer
night
had
gathered
in
scintillating
blue
and
purple
spots
nowhere
the
slightest
sign
of
danger
then
he
did
as
she
had
asked
they
nestled
on
the
boat
bottom
pressed
close
against
each
other
with
their
heads
leaning
against
the
bench
on
which
konrad
had
been
sitting
and
she
told
her
tale
told
of
the
legacy
her
vanished
father
had
left
what
power
had
always
emanated
from
it
how
it
had
completely
filled
her
girlhood
years
though
later
it
had
acquired
a
far
loftier
and
more
mysterious
significance
becoming
a
symbol
of
her
deeds
when
her
life
sank
into
chaos
and
nothingness
it
remained
dumb
often
for
years
but
if
her
soul
began
to
soar
when
her
hopes
and
activities
harmonised
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
reappeared
and
with
its
soft
song
drowned
the
world
evil
it
had
not
been
able
to
guard
her
against
guilt
or
disgrace
but
it
had
kept
her
free
inwardly
and
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
the
one
who
would
some
day
come
to
her
and
now
that
he
actually
had
come
she
felt
that
this
hour
of
fulfilment
had
struck
both
for
her
and
her
song
of
songs
it
must
now
go
forth
into
the
world
and
conquer
all
hearts
and
bring
purification
and
upliftment
to
its
creator
and
herself
in
her
enthusiasm
she
forgot
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
whole
world
the
one
thought
obsessed
her
to
throw
more
of
her
inward
self
of
what
was
most
holy
to
her
at
his
feet
but
she
had
said
everything
more
than
she
had
ever
deemed
herself
likely
to
tell
a
living
soul
more
than
she
had
known
of
herself
up
to
that
hour
he
now
held
in
his
hands
whatever
there
was
of
good
and
lofty
and
hopeful
still
within
her
the
other
the
lazy
the
impure
that
which
had
ruined
her
heart
and
life
no
longer
existed
it
no
longer
concerned
her
while
speaking
though
she
would
have
liked
to
look
at
him
she
had
not
dared
to
but
now
that
she
was
finished
she
ventured
to
turn
toward
him
she
saw
his
eyes
resting
upon
her
with
a
singularly
confused
and
drunken
look
such
as
she
had
never
before
seen
in
him
he
usually
held
his
feelings
as
it
were
in
his
clenched
fists
her
heart
began
to
throb
and
the
hopeful
disquiet
for
which
she
had
no
name
and
no
object
became
so
strong
that
she
felt
she
should
have
to
run
to
the
other
end
of
the
boat
to
keep
from
stifling
at
his
side
then
she
saw
him
close
his
eyes
and
throw
his
head
back
hard
against
the
bench
you
hurt
yourself
she
whispered
and
so
far
from
fleeing
him
she
laid
her
arm
like
a
pillow
between
his
neck
and
the
cutting
edge
of
the
bench
his
head
rested
on
her
bosom
and
he
breathed
heavily
shall
i
sing
some
more
of
it
she
asked
bending
over
him
tenderly
yes
yes
yes
he
burst
out
so
she
sang
in
a
low
caressing
voice
as
if
they
were
lullabies
all
those
arias
and
odes
which
no
mortal
ear
had
heard
from
her
lips
since
the
day
when
her
mother
soul
had
gone
down
into
eternal
night
she
sang
of
the
lily
of
the
valley
and
the
rose
of
sharon
and
the
verse
in
which
all
the
witchery
of
spring
is
concentrated
for
lo
the
winter
is
past
the
rain
is
over
and
gone
the
flowers
appear
on
the
earth
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
voice
of
the
turtle
is
heard
in
the
land
the
fig
putteth
forth
her
green
figs
and
the
vines
with
the
tender
grape
give
a
good
smell
arise
my
love
my
fair
one
and
come
away
she
sang
more
and
still
more
if
she
asked
him
enough
he
merely
shook
his
head
and
nestled
closer
once
she
gave
a
fleeting
glance
upward
and
noticed
they
were
wedged
in
among
the
reeds
and
night
had
completely
descended
but
what
cared
she
somehow
or
other
they
would
manage
to
get
home
there
was
little
more
of
it
to
sing
set
me
as
a
seal
upon
thy
heart
and
how
beautiful
are
thy
steps
in
sandals
o
prince
daughter
and
then
the
verse
the
beginning
of
which
so
well
suited
the
day
come
my
friend
let
us
go
forth
into
the
field
but
when
it
came
to
let
us
see
if
the
vine
have
blossomed
whether
the
young
grape
have
opened
she
could
scarcely
go
on
whether
the
pomegranates
have
budded
there
will
i
give
my
caresses
unto
thee
she
was
unable
to
continue
her
breath
began
to
give
out
why
do
you
sing
she
heard
him
ask
a
buzzing
of
bees
a
ringing
of
bells
all
about
be
brave
her
soul
cried
else
you
will
lose
him
she
felt
two
twitching
lips
grope
for
hers
a
swift
end
to
all
bravery
it
was
long
past
midnight
when
they
landed
the
bathing
pavilion
stood
there
dark
and
deserted
but
lights
were
still
shining
in
the
hotel
very
timidly
they
rang
the
bell
we
always
keep
a
room
for
belated
young
married
couples
said
the
obsequious
smiling
hostess
chapter
xvi
it
would
be
wide
of
the
truth
to
aver
that
no
happy
star
favoured
lilly
ripened
love
in
the
first
place
adele
proved
to
be
a
circumspect
ally
thoroughly
accustomed
to
be
uncommunicative
and
passionately
devoted
to
the
cause
of
lilly
lover
in
the
second
place
richard
who
had
gone
to
his
mother
in
harzburg
that
sunday
had
remained
away
the
greater
part
of
a
week
instead
of
one
day
and
in
the
third
place
upon
visiting
her
on
his
return
he
was
so
preoccupied
with
himself
and
his
own
affairs
as
not
to
notice
in
the
least
lilly
guilty
embarrassed
reception
of
him
he
affected
a
highly
lofty
mien
and
talked
through
his
nose
as
always
when
he
pulled
his
soul
together
as
it
were
and
became
vividly
conscious
of
having
once
been
a
cavalry
officer
he
even
wore
his
monocle
again
hanging
down
over
his
silk
waistcoat
all
of
which
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
crafty
expression
with
which
he
blinked
his
eyes
and
steadily
looked
past
lilly
and
dropped
his
head
on
his
left
shoulder
gave
sufficient
ground
for
the
welcome
assumption
that
he
had
delayed
the
visit
to
his
mother
and
instead
like
lilly
herself
had
taken
a
side
excursion
into
the
blossoming
world
of
spring
the
conjecture
however
proved
to
be
false
richard
had
been
in
harzburg
the
whole
time
and
intended
to
return
the
very
next
day
for
a
longer
stay
of
at
least
four
weeks
what
the
matter
he
exclaimed
in
alarm
lilly
overwhelmed
by
the
veritable
tempest
of
happiness
that
burst
upon
her
had
reeled
and
sunk
on
the
arm
of
a
chair
she
instantly
collected
her
wits
again
and
denied
that
she
had
been
overcome
nevertheless
he
remained
full
of
solicitude
kissed
her
on
her
neck
again
and
again
and
would
not
permit
her
to
go
to
the
trouble
of
pouring
out
the
tea
for
him
a
guilty
conscience
peeped
from
every
pore
of
his
being
unfortunately
he
said
trying
to
return
to
his
former
lofty
manner
unfortunately
there
no
longer
a
chance
of
our
taking
a
trip
together
anyhow
we
gotten
too
used
to
each
other
both
of
us
will
have
to
practise
getting
along
without
each
other
it
highly
desirable
we
should
we
certainly
should
his
words
sounded
like
familiar
music
coming
from
a
great
great
distance
confess
she
said
smiling
what
is
it
this
time
out
he
came
with
it
stuttering
and
choking
over
his
words
an
american
heiress
of
german
extraction
millions
and
millions
not
millions
of
marks
but
millions
of
dollars
very
stylish
and
chic
a
wonderful
piece
of
luck
mama
in
a
quiver
to
have
it
go
through
her
parents
favourably
disposed
she
too
evidently
not
disinclined
this
time
or
never
congratulate
you
said
lilly
giving
him
a
friendly
handshake
he
looked
at
her
with
large
astonished
and
somewhat
reproachful
eyes
is
that
all
he
asked
why
what
else
how
can
you
remain
so
cool
does
the
thought
that
your
old
friend
is
about
to
leave
you
move
you
in
the
least
i
took
you
to
be
more
loving
more
sympathetic
i
certainly
did
please
remember
said
lilly
you
reproach
me
the
same
way
each
time
you
make
up
your
mind
to
marry
because
i
do
want
to
be
a
hindrance
to
you
you
always
act
as
if
had
dismissed
you
and
not
you
me
he
burst
into
expostulations
dismiss
what
language
you
use
you
have
the
least
idea
of
going
on
within
me
how
i
struggle
and
wrestle
with
myself
why
i
have
slept
for
nights
thinking
what
will
become
of
you
but
you
behave
as
if
it
did
concern
you
in
the
least
altogether
you
frivolous
you
have
no
feelings
now
you
know
it
while
he
spoke
pictures
of
her
approaching
freedom
danced
before
her
eyes
nights
of
unshackled
glowing
love
days
full
of
sweet
vague
dreams
what
followed
lay
as
far
off
as
the
end
of
the
world
smiling
she
listened
and
never
even
responded
though
your
future
does
seem
to
worry
he
continued
to
upbraid
her
must
give
it
all
the
more
consideration
i
must
provide
for
you
and
mama
quite
agrees
with
me
the
word
mama
tore
her
from
her
world
of
dreams
since
the
terrific
encounter
in
richard
office
it
had
scarcely
ever
passed
their
lips
they
had
employed
a
thousand
circumlocutions
and
substitutes
which
they
understood
and
which
each
appreciated
in
the
other
now
mama
suddenly
rang
in
her
ears
the
symbol
of
her
disgraced
existence
oh
she
cried
if
she
in
it
it
bound
to
be
humiliating
to
me
i
tell
both
of
you
one
thing
take
good
care
not
to
make
a
proposition
to
me
about
money
or
support
or
anything
of
the
sort
consider
it
an
outrageous
insult
for
which
you
could
make
amends
he
ran
up
and
down
the
room
wringing
his
hands
what
are
you
talking
about
again
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
be
eternally
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
woman
do
you
know
you
ruined
if
i
turn
you
adrift
do
you
know
where
you
go
to
to
the
bars
and
brothels
do
you
know
it
in
blissful
absentmindedness
lilly
looked
past
him
and
his
gallant
zeal
there
are
other
ways
she
whispered
half
to
herself
what
ways
he
cried
marriage
forsooth
what
decent
man
would
marry
you
after
you
been
my
mistress
for
four
years
there
are
other
ways
than
that
too
she
repeated
still
smiling
she
saw
a
life
full
of
fight
and
vigour
a
tossing
hither
and
thither
through
storm
and
stress
a
jubilant
triumph
which
led
her
into
the
community
of
those
who
were
as
proud
and
true
as
but
all
that
would
come
later
much
much
later
why
think
of
it
now
richard
put
his
own
construction
upon
her
words
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
suspiciously
and
stopping
in
front
of
her
asked
with
a
shudder
i
say
are
you
going
to
do
something
foolish
she
burst
out
laughing
probably
he
already
saw
her
beautiful
corpse
taken
from
the
water
and
stretched
on
the
bier
no
i
wo
do
anything
foolish
certainly
not
for
your
sake
and
even
if
i
intended
to
i
have
the
good
taste
not
to
threaten
you
with
it
he
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
though
by
no
means
quite
calmed
at
any
rate
he
said
i
greatly
dislike
your
poking
here
alone
you
simply
get
the
blues
and
feel
irritated
at
me
i
say
while
gone
would
you
like
to
take
a
little
trip
to
a
bath
ahlbeck
or
schreiberbau
or
some
other
place
of
the
sort
where
respectable
people
go
nothing
on
the
surface
but
a
faint
twitch
of
her
eyelids
betrayed
the
laugh
of
scorn
that
shook
her
internally
you
know
she
said
i
do
like
to
make
up
to
people
and
so
i
be
all
the
more
alone
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
lost
in
thought
well
then
he
hesitated
and
chewed
his
words
as
people
are
wont
to
do
when
they
dread
their
own
bravery
then
it
would
be
best
if
you
come
and
stay
near
near
near
what
oh
do
act
that
way
you
know
what
i
mean
i
do
but
i
can
not
believe
it
what
so
awful
about
it
i
could
look
after
you
now
and
then
or
talk
over
matters
different
things
and
show
her
to
me
so
as
to
get
my
opinion
and
my
blessing
eh
well
and
supposing
it
so
the
way
we
are
to
each
other
the
way
we
have
done
a
thing
for
years
without
asking
each
other
advice
what
so
monstrous
about
it
lilly
felt
a
patronising
pity
arise
within
her
she
stroked
his
hands
and
said
dear
friend
i
do
think
i
furnish
the
right
sort
of
assistance
to
you
in
your
courtship
her
superior
tone
increased
his
goodness
gracious
you
talk
as
if
you
were
on
the
stage
altogether
you
so
puffed
up
so
puffed
up
of
course
you
simply
want
to
revenge
yourself
on
me
by
making
me
angry
i
must
say
it
not
at
all
noble
of
you
at
such
a
time
she
laughed
and
stretched
herself
how
low
it
all
was
how
ridiculous
and
how
indifferent
to
her
after
all
did
it
concern
her
to
be
alone
alone
with
him
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
beside
that
then
you
do
want
to
she
shook
her
head
no
very
well
he
prepared
to
leave
in
anger
but
lacked
the
strength
lilly
hm
i
like
to
avoid
any
misunderstandings
you
seem
to
think
i
not
in
earnest
this
time
by
no
means
richard
i
wish
you
all
possible
happiness
but
really
with
the
best
of
intentions
i
can
be
of
no
service
to
you
in
this
affair
of
service
to
me
of
service
to
me
who
speaking
of
service
to
me
mama
was
quite
right
if
i
break
off
this
time
there
wo
be
anything
else
for
me
any
more
so
make
it
quite
clear
to
yourself
in
a
few
weeks
all
over
between
us
so
much
the
better
she
came
near
saying
but
she
saw
the
tears
in
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
refrained
from
hurting
him
four
years
lived
together
lay
behind
them
he
was
too
tightly
tied
to
her
apron
strings
she
felt
she
ought
not
to
let
him
go
without
her
advice
and
encouragement
so
she
spoke
to
him
as
to
a
child
she
said
his
mother
was
right
praised
his
project
and
counted
up
all
the
reasons
why
it
absolutely
had
to
be
in
order
to
calm
him
as
to
her
own
attitude
she
recalled
how
it
had
always
been
her
ambition
to
let
him
feel
his
freedom
and
never
stand
in
his
way
she
also
assured
him
she
would
cherish
friendly
sentiments
for
him
until
the
end
of
her
days
finally
on
parting
they
both
wept
chapter
xvii
now
the
way
was
clear
now
she
might
consecrate
the
new
life
and
rejoice
in
it
july
came
and
scorched
the
deserted
streets
the
denizens
of
the
aristocratic
west
side
who
remained
in
town
with
no
employer
to
drive
them
dreamed
away
idle
days
behind
drawn
shades
hovering
between
the
couch
and
the
bathtub
lilly
did
not
awaken
to
real
life
until
evening
came
when
the
world
endeavoured
to
throw
off
the
heat
it
had
absorbed
during
the
day
when
dusty
yellow
vapours
rolled
on
the
turbid
water
of
the
canal
and
beyond
the
chestnuts
the
leaves
of
which
were
already
beginning
to
wither
the
red
glow
of
the
heavens
melted
into
one
with
the
winking
lights
of
the
street
lamps
then
she
strolled
at
konrad
side
in
the
blue
twilight
of
the
streets
always
alert
to
escape
the
observation
of
acquaintances
staid
families
promenaded
to
the
beer
gardens
met
at
the
appointed
street
corners
and
among
them
surged
the
mass
of
those
whom
life
has
left
solitary
with
shy
passionate
yearnings
and
who
hope
to
steal
from
smiling
chance
that
for
which
they
no
longer
dare
implore
sterner
gods
over
the
exhausted
city
hung
a
sultry
haze
of
secret
desire
in
which
formal
restraint
and
genuine
feeling
flickered
and
went
out
leaving
no
sign
of
ever
having
been
how
remote
those
days
when
lilly
herself
wandered
about
in
the
same
fashion
hoping
for
the
intervention
of
fate
yet
lacking
the
courage
to
compel
it
and
shuddering
at
dangers
she
had
escaped
she
clung
closer
to
konrad
protecting
arm
she
and
konrad
always
managed
to
find
a
secluded
nook
where
gypsy
bands
played
their
fiddles
or
tyrolese
strummed
their
dulcimers
or
the
host
himself
some
musician
come
down
in
the
world
acted
as
orchestra
leader
in
the
corners
between
laurel
trees
planted
in
green
painted
tubs
they
had
little
fear
of
discovery
their
intercourse
had
undergone
a
change
there
were
still
instructive
discourses
upon
all
sorts
of
subjects
and
lilly
intently
hung
upon
konrad
lips
but
her
holy
ardour
for
knowledge
had
cooled
down
that
god
does
not
exist
that
fra
lippo
lippi
had
been
a
that
baroque
art
has
it
good
points
and
that
a
line
gone
crazy
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
madhouse
even
if
it
poses
as
these
and
many
more
novel
interesting
things
lilly
had
long
known
but
they
no
longer
evoked
discussion
often
their
eyes
would
meet
and
linger
with
a
soft
yearning
smile
in
them
as
if
that
were
the
most
eloquent
language
in
which
they
could
talk
to
each
other
and
often
konrad
thoughts
went
their
own
way
returning
to
lilly
only
under
compulsion
she
would
then
grow
melancholy
and
jealous
and
insist
on
leaving
she
would
not
feel
thoroughly
content
until
he
lay
comfortably
in
her
arm
on
her
heart
the
walls
were
permeated
with
the
day
heat
the
curtains
threatened
suffocation
a
veritable
sirocco
blew
through
the
cracks
of
the
shutters
but
lilly
and
konrad
suffered
no
discomfort
the
glow
accorded
with
their
mood
it
was
the
greatest
disaster
for
either
of
them
to
fall
asleep
and
thus
shamefully
curtail
the
time
they
spent
together
so
they
agreed
that
the
one
who
remained
conscious
longer
should
rouse
the
other
lilly
was
invariably
the
one
to
remain
awake
konrad
was
exhausted
by
his
work
and
in
the
morning
he
could
not
doze
off
again
after
a
cup
of
tea
in
bed
or
in
the
afternoon
rest
on
the
couch
and
when
he
lay
there
next
to
her
with
twitching
limbs
like
a
thoroughbred
hunting
dog
she
felt
much
too
sorry
for
him
to
keep
her
promise
she
would
sit
up
in
bed
and
never
weary
of
gazing
at
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
there
was
always
something
in
his
face
to
study
the
fold
between
his
brows
deeper
than
before
and
still
somewhat
intimidating
the
muscles
of
his
temples
incessantly
working
and
the
curling
upper
lip
the
right
end
of
which
every
now
and
then
twitched
as
if
he
were
smiling
at
her
in
his
sleep
he
had
grown
thin
his
skin
had
lost
its
firmness
and
on
his
cheeks
lay
shadows
which
darkened
at
his
jaws
there
was
a
line
of
suffering
about
his
nostrils
he
looked
like
a
young
christ
created
just
to
be
adored
sometimes
while
staring
at
him
she
thought
if
i
were
to
kill
him
now
run
a
hat
pin
through
his
heart
or
something
of
the
sort
he
would
belong
to
me
to
me
alone
forever
then
she
would
hollow
her
hand
and
place
it
on
the
left
side
of
his
breast
and
fancy
she
held
his
heart
and
with
his
heart
his
love
which
she
need
never
more
give
up
once
while
she
bent
over
him
he
awoke
with
a
start
what
the
matter
did
i
do
anything
to
you
he
asked
why
your
expression
is
so
strange
almost
as
if
you
were
angry
with
me
she
resolved
not
to
stare
at
him
any
more
but
she
could
not
resist
she
loved
him
too
dearly
it
was
horrible
when
dread
seized
her
that
she
might
lose
him
many
a
night
it
attacked
her
with
such
awful
force
that
she
felt
like
screaming
and
raving
and
tearing
her
hair
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
rouse
him
so
she
gently
laid
her
head
under
his
shoulder
one
arm
under
his
back
the
other
across
his
breast
and
pressing
close
against
him
told
herself
she
had
grown
into
one
with
him
then
gradually
she
grew
calmer
and
could
find
comfort
in
tears
or
in
picturing
to
herself
how
happy
she
would
make
him
unspeakably
happy
she
would
envelop
him
in
a
mantle
of
love
so
soft
and
thick
as
to
prevent
fate
rude
blows
from
reaching
him
she
would
be
his
muse
would
wear
an
invisible
aureole
about
her
head
enkindle
the
desire
within
him
for
a
thousand
great
deeds
she
would
give
him
the
devoted
care
of
a
sister
of
mercy
would
learn
to
cook
and
make
her
own
dresses
no
rather
attend
scientific
courses
at
the
university
and
study
music
oh
she
would
do
many
more
things
that
he
should
never
weary
of
her
for
all
this
of
course
she
would
first
have
to
be
free
with
relations
between
her
and
richard
entirely
broken
off
she
often
thought
of
richard
also
but
without
a
shadow
of
blame
she
had
long
forgiven
him
for
having
led
her
to
the
brink
of
the
abyss
each
person
acts
according
to
the
law
of
his
own
being
konrad
had
said
besides
richard
had
once
been
her
saviour
so
far
as
the
outer
world
was
concerned
the
new
life
was
to
begin
as
soon
as
richard
announced
his
engagement
he
had
written
that
his
suit
was
progressing
and
by
right
her
free
life
with
konrad
ought
already
to
have
commenced
but
lilly
did
not
feel
equal
to
a
crisis
she
shuddered
at
all
the
lies
she
would
continually
have
to
dish
up
to
konrad
once
a
change
took
place
in
her
household
she
avoided
facing
the
poverty
that
was
bound
to
come
it
was
only
at
night
when
she
had
worked
herself
into
a
joyous
ecstasy
on
the
sleeping
man
breast
and
her
future
with
him
stretched
before
her
in
gold
and
purple
that
privation
seemed
to
her
the
very
sum
and
substance
of
happiness
and
plenitude
at
three
in
the
morning
when
the
street
lamps
went
out
one
by
one
and
the
grey
of
dawn
came
creeping
over
the
ceiling
lilly
would
have
to
awaken
him
he
must
not
meet
any
of
the
tenants
of
the
house
she
owed
it
to
his
and
her
own
reputation
while
dressing
he
groped
about
drunk
with
sleep
among
lilly
ivory
toilet
articles
still
resplendent
with
the
coronet
and
managed
to
get
himself
into
shape
for
a
stimulating
cup
of
black
coffee
at
the
nearest
vienna
café
for
he
felt
that
from
lilly
bed
he
must
go
to
his
desk
with
all
possible
speed
he
could
not
be
dissuaded
from
this
madness
the
passionate
hours
of
the
night
demanded
atonement
an
idea
to
which
he
clung
tenaciously
no
matter
that
he
spent
the
early
morning
hours
in
vain
wearisome
brooding
over
his
papers
lilly
on
the
other
hand
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
adele
roused
her
at
about
ten
when
she
brought
in
the
breakfast
tray
smiling
contentedly
lilly
let
konrad
have
every
other
night
for
himself
she
did
not
want
to
suck
his
lifeblood
away
even
so
he
gave
her
sufficient
cause
for
worry
his
colour
was
bad
his
eyes
vacillated
his
mood
varied
abruptly
from
violent
gaiety
to
all
that
would
surely
be
different
when
once
what
to
think
of
nothing
to
plan
nothing
to
wish
for
nothing
just
to
love
him
and
know
he
was
happy
she
spent
her
days
dreaming
both
pleasant
and
tremulous
dreams
her
intense
fervour
for
mental
occupation
had
departed
besides
all
sorts
of
new
and
important
things
intervened
to
distract
her
especially
the
need
to
please
him
to
hand
him
daily
the
draft
that
intoxicated
him
and
kept
him
her
own
hitherto
she
had
taken
the
beauty
of
her
body
as
a
matter
of
course
and
had
paid
as
little
regard
to
it
as
to
a
hidden
and
useless
object
now
she
felt
she
must
constantly
take
thought
of
the
ideal
he
treasured
in
his
mind
must
try
to
resemble
it
she
well
knew
that
in
reality
she
approached
it
a
little
only
when
drunken
bliss
exalted
her
above
herself
and
the
stale
and
unprofitable
flats
of
her
life
thus
arose
an
eager
cult
of
her
flesh
something
she
had
always
despised
she
took
care
of
her
body
like
a
woman
in
a
harem
perfumed
her
baths
manicured
her
toe
nails
lengthened
her
eyebrows
and
powdered
her
arms
and
shoulders
every
day
she
discovered
new
blemishes
which
discouraged
her
and
for
which
she
sought
new
remedies
at
the
same
time
she
was
ever
haunted
by
the
fear
that
through
sheer
attention
to
her
toilet
she
would
acquire
the
look
of
a
beautiful
prostitute
so
she
locked
away
her
jewellery
and
dressed
very
simply
none
but
the
connoisseur
could
discern
how
much
artistic
care
had
gone
into
the
creation
of
this
faultless
simplicity
when
she
was
alone
what
troubled
her
most
was
jealousy
not
that
she
suspected
him
of
relations
with
another
woman
he
stood
too
high
in
her
estimation
for
that
but
she
was
jealous
of
everything
he
did
the
thought
of
his
desk
fairly
tortured
her
each
hour
he
spent
away
from
her
seemed
traitorous
to
her
love
and
she
thought
of
his
friends
with
a
hostility
of
which
she
had
never
deemed
herself
capable
on
the
evenings
she
was
left
alone
she
held
watch
over
his
room
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
where
she
stood
pressed
in
a
doorway
exactly
as
formerly
in
alte
jakobstrasse
when
his
lamp
was
lighted
she
was
satisfied
but
when
she
saw
him
come
or
go
at
a
late
hour
she
did
not
sleep
the
whole
night
he
lived
a
short
distance
from
her
in
a
room
it
was
long
before
he
permitted
her
to
call
on
him
in
the
room
next
to
his
he
explained
lay
a
sick
woman
who
had
to
be
kept
from
the
slightest
excitement
the
sound
of
a
strange
voice
might
aggravate
her
condition
while
telling
this
to
lilly
he
strangely
avoided
her
eyes
and
she
felt
that
a
hundred
chances
to
one
he
was
keeping
something
from
her
but
when
upon
her
insistence
he
admitted
her
to
his
room
one
afternoon
she
found
nothing
to
confirm
her
suspicions
she
merely
had
to
speak
very
low
which
she
had
known
beforehand
his
room
was
just
an
ordinary
student
room
it
had
two
windows
a
high
ceiling
cheap
furniture
and
no
couch
and
no
carpet
but
valuable
engravings
adorned
the
walls
and
the
customary
was
hidden
behind
an
old
copy
of
the
madonna
di
foligno
who
looked
down
in
serene
loftiness
upon
the
poverty
of
northern
philistinism
there
were
long
low
bookcases
full
of
books
and
more
books
for
which
there
was
no
room
on
the
shelves
were
piled
up
high
in
the
corners
protected
against
dust
by
pieces
of
crushed
such
as
pedlars
use
for
wrapping
about
their
wares
as
was
to
be
expected
the
desk
was
the
only
article
that
displayed
a
certain
luxuriousness
like
the
pictures
it
was
konrad
own
property
with
its
noble
carving
and
broad
top
it
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
solemn
as
an
altar
not
one
woman
picture
to
be
seen
on
it
lilly
had
not
given
him
hers
and
evidently
others
were
not
deemed
worthy
of
the
place
of
honour
there
was
only
one
photograph
that
of
an
old
gentleman
framed
with
glass
which
stood
back
of
the
blotting
pad
and
the
ink
well
a
epicurean
face
with
fine
hair
and
shrewd
eyes
beneath
lids
eyes
peculiar
to
old
connoisseurs
of
women
it
was
the
picture
of
the
uncle
who
had
paid
for
konrad
education
and
supported
him
lilly
felt
a
dull
oppression
as
if
those
eyes
were
looking
her
through
and
through
and
needed
but
a
glance
to
unveil
the
great
secret
that
she
concealed
from
her
lover
with
a
thousand
subterfuges
i
be
careful
never
to
meet
him
she
thought
konrad
took
from
a
drawer
his
precious
treasure
the
preliminary
work
on
his
great
history
of
human
emotions
and
showed
lilly
the
reams
of
paper
closely
covered
with
writing
this
work
was
his
real
love
and
she
lilly
czepanek
was
nothing
but
a
dark
bloodless
shadow
which
greedily
glided
through
his
nights
put
it
back
again
she
said
discontentedly
and
turned
away
to
take
leave
but
even
his
great
work
was
not
enough
for
konrad
in
addition
he
drudged
over
a
number
of
short
articles
as
his
name
become
known
in
professional
circles
he
received
an
increasing
number
of
orders
all
of
which
he
accepted
and
tried
to
fill
and
one
day
lilly
found
out
what
the
important
position
was
of
which
he
had
spoken
three
weeks
before
on
that
excursion
i
could
make
up
my
mind
until
said
konrad
but
now
i
have
actually
decided
to
take
the
position
it
is
assistant
editorship
on
a
magazine
the
called
on
me
himself
and
would
let
go
of
me
until
i
said
yes
a
fascinating
fellow
in
spite
of
his
great
intellectual
ability
a
man
of
childlike
innocence
and
so
frank
and
friendly
you
must
get
to
know
him
immediately
if
you
do
already
what
is
his
name
dr
salmoni
chapter
xviii
no
it
came
about
differently
fate
did
not
lay
its
clutch
upon
her
with
such
rude
hands
lilly
was
spared
the
disgrace
of
being
caught
like
a
criminal
and
by
an
act
of
volition
was
enabled
to
prove
that
she
was
not
unworthy
of
the
great
passion
that
had
blessed
her
life
after
the
mention
of
salmoni
name
lilly
feared
to
venture
out
on
the
street
with
konrad
she
imagined
that
each
person
coming
behind
them
must
be
the
dreaded
man
who
had
once
stolen
upon
her
in
front
of
the
house
on
alte
jakobstrasse
and
might
be
following
her
now
as
he
had
then
in
order
to
save
herself
this
torture
she
finally
told
konrad
that
a
lady
of
her
acquaintance
had
visited
her
the
day
before
and
had
asked
with
marked
emphasis
about
the
slim
young
man
with
whom
she
had
always
appeared
the
effect
of
lilly
lie
was
terrifying
konrad
said
nothing
and
ate
nothing
he
paced
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
wild
hunted
expression
and
went
away
at
the
very
moment
when
their
happiest
hours
were
wont
to
begin
the
following
day
light
was
thrown
upon
the
situation
konrad
came
at
twilight
paler
than
usual
his
eyes
shining
unnaturally
listen
darling
he
said
i
spent
the
night
thinking
everything
over
and
now
i
know
what
i
ought
to
do
we
ca
go
on
this
way
she
thought
he
meant
that
he
must
leave
her
an
icy
numbness
spread
over
her
body
she
looked
at
him
quietly
awaiting
the
death
blow
since
we
belong
to
each
other
he
continued
we
have
never
spoken
of
your
betrothed
that
does
mean
i
did
think
of
him
and
you
have
been
very
reticent
about
his
friend
dehnicke
all
i
know
is
dehnicke
is
now
off
on
a
trip
and
has
left
you
so
to
speak
without
a
guardian
she
forced
herself
to
smile
why
did
he
prolong
the
agony
i
must
confess
in
the
midst
of
all
my
happiness
i
have
always
felt
that
this
exploiting
of
the
situation
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
contemptible
so
far
as
i
myself
am
concerned
but
i
am
not
the
one
to
be
considered
the
question
is
what
will
become
of
you
the
thing
i
dreaded
from
the
very
first
has
come
to
pass
your
friends
have
begun
to
notice
us
together
you
ca
ask
one
person
not
to
tell
another
degrading
so
your
friend
will
discover
everything
he
will
call
you
to
account
you
will
be
too
proud
to
deny
the
truth
and
the
end
of
the
story
will
be
that
you
will
be
left
alone
utterly
unprotected
because
the
way
things
are
now
have
even
the
right
to
protect
you
the
thought
of
it
is
sickening
he
jumped
up
ran
his
outspread
fingers
through
his
imaginary
shock
of
hair
and
tramped
up
and
down
lilly
felt
the
blood
begin
to
course
through
her
veins
again
and
with
it
life
and
thought
the
dear
noble
unsuspecting
boy
she
came
near
bursting
into
laughter
but
she
refrained
herself
and
said
you
can
be
perfectly
calm
konni
dehnicke
wo
find
out
and
even
if
he
does
he
wo
believe
it
or
if
he
believes
it
he
will
take
good
care
she
could
not
continue
the
great
innocent
eyes
troubled
her
so
you
still
think
he
will
konrad
also
faltered
he
too
was
unable
to
utter
the
unspeakable
lilly
regarded
the
buttons
on
her
skirt
and
said
nothing
when
is
dehnicke
coming
home
again
he
asked
he
not
certain
he
gone
lilly
replied
with
a
little
feeling
of
triumph
she
thought
she
was
saying
something
which
raised
her
above
suspicion
in
the
future
there
was
still
a
possibility
of
suspicion
where
is
he
now
why
do
you
want
to
know
i
want
to
speak
to
him
lilly
started
she
could
not
believe
her
ears
it
not
be
either
she
must
have
lost
her
reason
or
konrad
do
be
afraid
he
reassured
her
i
know
quite
well
what
i
owe
your
reputation
but
i
should
like
to
find
out
at
last
what
thinks
of
your
situation
there
a
man
in
the
united
states
whom
you
are
pledged
to
yet
he
does
let
himself
be
heard
from
he
does
come
for
you
he
does
write
why
does
he
write
if
he
ignorant
of
your
whereabouts
he
perfectly
aware
that
dehnicke
business
is
known
in
berlin
you
ca
be
sure
he
still
alive
at
first
i
tried
to
explain
his
silence
in
various
ways
but
now
i
say
to
myself
either
dead
or
as
good
as
dead
and
are
you
to
consider
yourself
bound
should
you
make
your
entire
social
existence
dependent
upon
a
sort
of
guard
of
honour
which
has
nothing
more
to
guard
i
like
to
hold
all
this
under
dehnicke
nose
he
have
to
answer
me
do
you
think
he
will
konrad
has
less
worldly
knowledge
than
is
permissible
thought
lilly
pityingly
and
replied
but
i
do
understand
konni
what
right
you
have
to
call
a
stranger
to
account
that
my
affair
he
rejoined
tossing
his
head
defiantly
i
must
know
if
he
will
set
you
free
i
wo
brook
his
playing
the
over
you
and
i
wo
brook
your
getting
yourself
into
a
false
position
cried
lilly
in
reawakened
alarm
she
already
heard
blows
and
pistol
shots
i
myself
will
speak
to
dehnicke
i
will
free
myself
i
promise
you
but
you
if
go
to
him
what
will
he
think
of
me
at
best
you
will
merely
succeed
in
compromising
me
he
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
his
eyes
flashed
victoriously
if
a
man
loves
you
and
wants
you
to
be
his
wife
why
should
that
compromise
you
it
was
hot
and
murky
when
these
words
were
spoken
the
canary
ran
about
on
the
sand
of
his
cage
chirping
wearily
his
wings
drooping
the
gold
fish
hung
motionless
behind
their
glass
walls
and
the
naked
monkey
whined
in
its
sleep
the
slimy
canal
water
reflected
bluish
black
clouds
a
storm
hovered
in
the
atmosphere
and
this
was
the
lilly
first
sensation
was
one
of
surprise
not
joyous
surprise
indeed
not
then
came
an
unspeakably
mournful
cry
which
no
mortal
ear
heard
though
all
the
more
painful
in
its
muteness
too
late
a
lost
chance
nothing
to
hope
for
no
more
happiness
on
earth
too
late
she
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
and
studied
the
ceiling
attentively
and
thoroughly
he
was
awaiting
his
answer
if
she
lowered
her
eyes
she
would
have
to
encounter
his
eyes
which
ate
into
her
soul
no
salvation
from
those
eyes
no
salvation
from
that
which
must
perforce
come
and
he
was
waiting
then
she
heard
her
own
voice
very
clear
and
very
calm
as
if
jula
were
speaking
in
her
place
that
little
artist
of
life
with
the
iron
brow
i
thought
konni
you
and
i
had
agreed
never
to
marry
how
can
you
remind
me
of
it
he
cried
violently
did
i
know
how
things
would
turn
out
when
i
said
it
did
i
know
who
you
are
and
what
bliss
and
torture
a
goddess
of
a
woman
like
you
can
bestow
on
a
poor
devil
yes
torture
i
must
tell
you
everything
i
at
my
end
there
a
break
in
my
life
everything
is
torn
asunder
my
work
my
thoughts
my
belief
in
you
you
want
to
be
my
good
genius
instead
you
almost
my
evil
genius
do
be
frightened
it
not
your
fault
i
am
not
reproaching
you
only
myself
for
being
so
weak
i
want
to
work
i
must
work
i
have
assumed
a
number
of
duties
i
thought
if
duty
came
from
the
outside
i
could
force
myself
into
the
right
path
the
very
reverse
has
happened
i
growing
stupid
just
from
wrestling
with
myself
i
must
bring
peace
into
our
lives
else
we
both
lost
and
i
ca
have
peace
unless
you
belong
to
me
unless
your
bed
is
next
to
my
bed
and
the
desk
is
in
the
next
room
and
always
with
me
i
can
move
to
you
in
the
autumn
lilly
interjected
timidly
no
nothing
of
that
sort
any
more
no
no
secretiveness
should
i
have
it
on
my
conscience
that
each
additional
day
on
which
you
sacrifice
yourself
you
drawing
nearer
to
ruin
and
it
bound
to
ruin
you
it
will
cling
to
you
like
dirt
and
why
should
we
create
dirt
out
of
what
is
most
sacred
to
us
or
am
i
not
good
enough
to
be
your
do
you
think
you
will
be
too
poor
as
my
wife
she
repudiated
the
idea
with
a
lively
exclamation
of
scorn
i
do
know
and
i
do
need
to
know
how
much
you
have
i
am
rich
enough
now
i
get
three
hundred
marks
a
month
from
my
uncle
salmoni
pays
me
four
hundred
oh
how
she
started
at
the
name
and
i
can
easily
earn
another
three
hundred
by
writing
articles
in
all
a
thousand
a
month
a
general
salary
you
may
be
satisfied
keep
quiet
she
cried
almost
beside
herself
it
is
that
then
what
is
it
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
her
challengingly
between
his
brows
were
those
folds
of
wrath
which
cut
her
like
a
knife
she
ducked
her
head
never
since
the
colonel
time
had
she
experienced
such
fear
of
a
human
being
tell
me
what
it
is
apparently
you
do
love
me
enough
you
still
cling
to
the
man
who
forgot
you
long
ago
you
probably
say
to
yourself
stupid
boy
is
good
enough
for
a
passing
love
he
good
enough
for
whiling
the
time
away
but
if
he
shows
any
intentions
of
interfering
with
my
life
i
must
get
rid
of
him
with
all
possible
speed
am
i
not
right
tell
me
be
brave
what
harm
can
i
do
you
just
tell
me
that
nothing
but
a
the
sort
of
man
you
would
want
as
a
husband
when
i
made
a
name
for
myself
then
you
will
be
willing
to
consider
marriage
too
am
i
not
right
well
then
he
picked
up
his
hat
to
go
have
pity
on
me
konni
she
implored
she
had
glided
down
from
her
seat
to
lay
her
head
on
his
knees
and
now
she
crouched
between
the
sofa
and
konrad
chair
and
groped
for
support
i
do
need
pity
you
do
need
he
cried
until
you
been
the
noblest
thing
on
earth
to
me
but
i
wo
suffer
myself
just
to
be
expunged
from
your
life
tell
me
why
you
do
want
to
marry
me
plausible
reason
and
i
never
return
to
the
subject
again
i
promise
you
give
me
until
she
groaned
why
for
what
is
as
good
as
i
come
to
the
end
of
my
tether
i
ca
spend
another
night
of
torture
i
will
write
to
you
that
surprised
him
what
will
you
write
whether
i
may
or
not
and
the
reasons
and
everything
during
the
night
i
manage
to
find
some
way
out
she
thought
when
will
i
get
the
letter
morning
by
the
first
delivery
very
well
i
will
wait
until
then
lilly
when
he
helped
her
back
on
the
sofa
and
held
his
hand
out
in
farewell
and
she
saw
his
eyes
fastened
on
her
with
their
candid
magnanimous
expression
which
a
lie
had
never
clouded
unsuspicious
still
she
was
suddenly
convinced
that
evasion
was
no
longer
possible
truth
nothing
but
the
truth
even
if
it
lead
to
perdition
konrad
must
now
be
told
the
truth
the
thought
flooded
her
soul
like
a
warm
soothing
stream
but
she
could
not
tell
him
the
truth
face
to
face
nobody
would
have
the
strength
of
will
for
that
the
reaction
did
not
set
in
until
she
was
left
alone
the
impulse
for
asserted
itself
if
jula
could
do
it
she
could
too
jula
had
much
worse
things
to
conceal
richard
of
course
would
say
nothing
which
was
the
main
consideration
now
that
he
wished
to
go
his
own
way
it
was
to
his
interest
for
her
to
vanish
decorously
from
his
life
the
rest
of
the
crew
might
tattle
to
their
heart
content
konrad
was
immune
against
their
poison
the
only
dangerous
person
was
salmoni
but
if
she
went
to
him
soon
and
begged
him
he
too
would
maintain
silence
he
had
sufficiently
strong
motives
for
hushing
his
disgraceful
attempt
upon
her
besides
jula
had
said
you
must
wear
a
smile
on
your
brow
but
beneath
the
smile
your
brow
must
be
of
iron
thus
lilly
revolved
the
situation
in
her
mind
but
in
the
midst
of
her
brooding
and
planning
she
was
seized
with
disgust
of
herself
and
her
intentions
which
tore
the
whole
tissue
of
deceit
into
ragged
bits
why
it
was
sheer
folly
to
think
she
would
always
be
able
to
play
the
false
part
if
upon
the
mere
mention
of
salmoni
name
she
dreaded
appearing
on
the
street
with
konrad
how
could
she
go
through
a
lifetime
at
his
side
haunted
by
that
fear
what
repulses
and
humiliations
she
would
have
to
undergo
whenever
konrad
led
her
into
the
society
in
which
as
his
wife
she
would
belong
she
whom
the
papers
had
taken
up
and
treated
as
a
rising
star
in
the
fashionable
and
worst
of
all
if
konrad
should
begin
to
suspect
how
he
would
eat
his
heart
away
in
shame
and
abhorrence
he
with
his
pride
and
delicate
susceptibilities
and
that
unworldly
purity
which
alone
accounted
for
the
fact
that
no
surmise
as
to
her
real
life
had
ever
touched
his
soul
what
an
awaking
from
a
short
torturing
dream
no
she
could
not
do
what
jula
had
done
and
she
threw
far
from
her
the
shameful
thought
with
which
the
stress
of
the
hour
had
stained
her
wrestling
soul
an
exultant
craving
for
came
over
her
the
desire
to
tear
her
breast
open
and
throw
her
throbbing
heart
at
his
feet
so
she
sat
down
and
wrote
my
dear
sweet
konni
i
have
shamefully
deceived
you
i
am
a
prostitute
or
something
not
much
better
the
man
to
whom
i
told
you
i
was
betrothed
is
a
myth
he
was
a
little
lieutenant
i
wickedly
broke
my
marriage
vows
for
his
sake
and
he
never
thought
of
marrying
me
but
turned
me
over
to
his
rich
friend
who
made
me
his
mistress
his
mistress
i
still
am
i
have
been
living
for
years
in
the
world
of
vice
and
vulgarity
i
am
an
outlaw
from
decent
society
hired
mistresses
and
their
lovers
who
pay
them
form
my
sole
associates
i
clung
to
you
because
you
in
your
innocence
respected
me
and
because
i
down
in
the
mire
clamoured
for
respect
now
you
know
why
i
may
not
be
your
wife
if
you
desire
my
kisses
come
i
am
not
fit
for
anything
else
lilly
it
was
nearly
eleven
adele
had
gone
to
bed
it
occurred
to
lilly
that
she
would
have
to
go
down
to
mail
the
letter
herself
but
the
storm
that
had
been
impending
the
whole
afternoon
was
just
then
giving
full
vent
to
its
fury
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
sheets
and
gusts
of
wind
blew
through
the
open
window
across
lilly
desk
once
a
shower
of
drops
spattered
the
paper
at
which
she
was
staring
with
hot
dry
eyes
it
looked
as
if
tears
had
fallen
upon
it
while
she
was
writing
very
good
she
thought
then
she
felt
ashamed
the
time
for
farce
was
ended
but
when
she
started
to
rewrite
the
letter
she
stopped
short
with
a
shudder
what
did
those
monstrous
signify
were
they
the
truth
perhaps
so
in
the
mouth
of
a
backbiting
woman
who
needs
facts
about
her
friend
in
order
to
twist
them
into
a
crime
or
in
the
mouth
of
one
of
those
social
hangmen
who
hold
a
halter
in
readiness
for
past
for
herself
who
knew
how
everything
had
come
about
how
from
inner
need
and
outer
compulsion
from
trustfulness
and
defencelessness
link
after
link
of
the
chain
had
been
forged
which
now
clanked
about
her
body
a
burden
of
sin
for
her
there
was
another
a
milder
truth
which
must
win
pardon
and
atonement
for
her
in
the
eyes
of
every
person
who
understood
she
tore
up
the
sheet
and
began
anew
she
draughted
a
sketch
and
polished
it
until
it
thoroughly
satisfied
her
my
dearly
beloved
friend
she
who
writes
this
letter
to
you
is
a
most
unhappy
woman
whom
you
know
only
slightly
and
who
had
to
deceive
you
until
because
what
is
most
sacred
to
her
her
love
of
you
was
at
stake
and
now
with
these
lines
i
am
losing
that
love
i
am
sacrificing
it
to
your
happiness
to
the
divine
fire
which
sanctified
my
life
the
world
has
treated
me
badly
it
robbed
me
of
my
belief
in
man
my
ideals
my
will
power
and
so
deprived
me
of
the
right
to
go
through
life
at
your
side
i
began
my
course
full
of
confidence
and
hope
pure
to
the
core
of
my
being
each
man
who
stepped
into
my
existence
broke
off
a
piece
of
my
virtue
i
raised
my
eyes
in
devotion
to
my
aging
husband
who
promised
to
be
my
hero
master
model
and
idol
he
converted
me
into
a
tool
of
base
desires
another
man
came
who
was
young
like
myself
and
had
been
left
without
ties
like
myself
and
whom
i
wished
to
save
while
i
sought
refuge
with
him
he
took
me
and
tasted
me
i
was
a
fascinating
adventure
to
him
and
in
the
course
of
his
adventure
he
went
to
perdition
he
wrote
a
treacherous
letter
to
a
friend
placing
me
in
his
care
that
friend
exploited
my
spiritual
and
physical
needs
for
his
own
advantage
and
by
a
shameful
trick
made
me
so
dependent
upon
him
that
for
a
long
time
i
lived
as
his
creature
while
thinking
myself
free
and
untouched
helpless
and
broken
as
i
was
i
became
his
entirely
nor
ventured
even
to
feel
angry
at
him
i
was
so
slavishly
in
his
power
until
now
so
my
destiny
was
fulfilled
i
tried
desperately
to
struggle
out
of
the
dull
night
in
which
my
spirit
was
enveloped
but
nowhere
was
there
a
path
leading
up
to
the
light
with
ardour
i
seized
each
hand
held
out
to
help
me
but
each
thrust
me
still
lower
until
my
whole
being
sank
into
a
torpid
state
of
discouragement
then
you
came
my
beloved
my
saviour
my
redeemer
it
grew
light
about
me
the
world
blossomed
forth
again
the
drained
sources
began
to
flow
afresh
the
song
of
songs
resounded
and
with
pride
and
rapture
i
realised
that
nothing
shameful
had
taken
firm
root
in
my
character
that
the
times
of
ignominy
had
passed
over
my
head
without
destroying
my
inner
worth
my
desire
for
purity
my
instinct
for
a
great
noble
humanity
these
had
been
merely
dormant
and
you
beloved
awakened
them
to
activity
even
if
i
may
not
be
your
wife
your
wife
should
be
free
of
stain
i
want
to
be
worthy
of
you
whether
by
your
side
or
at
a
distance
wherever
you
tell
me
to
go
long
ago
i
decided
to
shake
off
my
chains
which
in
fact
have
been
merely
external
and
with
unencumbered
limbs
climb
up
to
a
new
life
in
harmony
with
the
demands
of
my
genuine
self
you
have
pointed
the
way
and
in
gratitude
i
kiss
your
dear
tender
industrious
hands
farewell
beloved
if
you
would
chastise
me
never
come
again
if
you
will
and
can
put
up
with
the
love
of
one
who
loves
you
as
no
other
woman
on
earth
will
love
you
then
do
not
turn
me
adrift
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
but
what
i
am
though
that
belongs
to
you
unto
death
lilly
she
read
and
reread
the
letter
and
read
herself
into
a
state
of
enthusiasm
over
it
now
the
truth
wore
quite
a
different
aspect
then
suddenly
the
question
arose
in
her
mind
it
the
truth
had
she
not
luxuriated
in
choice
words
had
she
not
smuggled
in
emotions
foreign
to
her
nature
phrases
like
dull
night
in
which
my
spirit
was
enveloped
and
tried
desperately
to
struggle
belonged
in
sentimental
novels
they
were
inapplicable
to
her
life
she
had
suffered
not
so
much
from
despair
as
from
boredom
and
during
that
dull
night
she
had
enjoyed
herself
greatly
on
many
an
occasion
richard
the
good
fellow
to
judge
by
her
insinuations
was
a
rank
despot
and
she
herself
a
sorry
subjugated
victim
whereas
in
reality
she
had
been
able
to
do
or
leave
undone
whatever
her
caprice
dictated
it
the
truth
and
yet
it
was
not
just
as
much
and
as
little
as
in
the
first
dreadful
letter
each
was
correct
enough
in
its
way
and
many
another
might
have
been
written
equally
correct
but
the
truth
the
genuine
truth
which
penetrated
and
illumined
the
whole
would
appear
in
none
that
truth
she
herself
did
not
know
nor
did
anybody
else
that
truth
vanished
with
the
moment
in
which
an
event
occurred
and
no
earthly
power
could
summon
it
back
all
that
her
words
reflected
were
distorted
images
varying
as
her
mood
varied
and
as
her
pen
travelled
over
the
paper
but
i
do
want
to
lie
she
cried
to
herself
i
want
to
be
true
so
she
tore
up
the
second
letter
also
what
now
should
she
write
a
third
letter
it
was
long
past
midnight
her
eyes
burned
her
temples
throbbed
with
and
konrad
was
to
hear
from
her
by
the
first
mail
in
the
morning
she
had
promised
him
at
this
point
the
full
force
of
what
had
happened
suddenly
struck
her
she
realised
that
in
the
last
four
hours
she
had
been
face
to
face
with
the
danger
of
losing
him
at
once
and
forever
she
was
beset
with
an
anguish
of
fear
that
threatened
to
rob
her
of
her
senses
she
cried
his
name
aloud
ran
about
the
apartment
reeled
knocked
against
the
walls
and
wanted
to
throw
herself
from
the
window
she
must
go
to
him
forthwith
that
was
the
one
idea
she
was
capable
of
grasping
she
would
have
the
porter
open
the
front
door
she
would
wake
konrad
up
force
her
way
into
his
room
and
stay
with
him
that
night
and
forever
no
matter
what
the
consequences
it
was
all
the
same
only
to
rid
herself
of
that
dread
which
burned
her
body
like
a
living
flame
the
storm
had
subsided
but
the
rain
was
falling
in
a
steady
downpour
lilly
scarcely
took
the
time
to
put
on
a
cloak
in
low
shoes
without
hat
or
umbrella
she
dashed
out
on
the
street
and
splashed
through
the
puddles
light
was
shining
from
the
two
windows
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
konni
konni
konni
again
and
again
but
the
windows
were
closed
he
did
not
hear
her
she
saw
his
figure
glide
back
and
forth
like
a
shadow
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
ceaselessly
and
all
the
time
the
rain
beat
down
on
her
soaking
through
her
clothes
while
the
cold
wet
of
the
pavement
crawled
up
her
legs
konni
konni
she
called
louder
passersby
offered
her
their
umbrellas
others
taunted
her
and
cried
konni
konni
at
last
the
shadow
halted
one
of
the
windows
went
up
lilly
you
his
voice
called
hoarse
with
fright
at
last
do
come
my
sweet
konni
a
tipsy
man
who
had
persistently
held
his
umbrella
over
her
answered
in
her
place
for
god
sake
the
light
disappeared
from
the
windows
and
a
few
moments
later
konrad
appeared
in
the
doorway
with
the
key
and
his
lamp
in
his
hand
the
tipsy
gentleman
said
bowing
and
scraping
lilly
what
has
happened
what
are
you
doing
here
she
pressed
against
the
doorpost
trembling
she
was
unable
to
speak
i
am
with
him
was
her
one
thought
so
all
well
he
passed
his
hand
over
her
clothes
why
you
dripping
wet
you
in
house
slippers
for
god
sake
lilly
she
wanted
to
say
something
but
was
ashamed
to
let
him
see
how
her
teeth
were
chattering
and
i
ca
even
take
you
to
my
room
you
know
why
but
i
must
if
i
were
to
let
you
go
back
home
again
in
the
state
you
in
you
might
catch
your
death
of
cold
we
will
be
very
careful
just
as
we
were
that
time
we
ca
speak
above
a
whisper
the
girl
not
out
of
danger
yet
give
me
your
hand
come
on
with
eyes
she
let
herself
be
led
up
the
stairs
her
wet
dress
flapped
against
the
balusters
she
felt
she
would
have
to
crouch
down
on
one
of
the
steps
and
lie
there
until
the
porter
came
to
sweep
the
dust
and
dirt
away
but
each
step
only
took
her
nearer
to
the
fate
awaiting
her
up
there
in
the
third
storey
then
with
bent
head
she
crept
along
the
corridor
into
his
room
where
the
imprisoned
sultriness
of
the
summer
day
suffocated
her
konrad
pressed
her
into
his
desk
chair
he
drew
off
the
soggy
velvet
rags
from
her
feet
and
brought
her
dry
stockings
and
after
peeling
her
wet
dress
from
her
body
he
wrapped
her
in
his
great
coat
and
blankets
she
sat
there
accepting
his
service
without
a
will
of
her
own
she
wanted
to
taste
the
delicious
sensation
of
his
loving
care
of
her
until
the
last
moment
she
had
not
said
a
word
when
she
had
attempted
to
thank
him
he
pointed
to
the
door
leading
to
the
next
room
speak
very
low
he
said
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
the
poor
thing
it
seems
is
having
a
good
night
for
the
first
time
languid
pity
awoke
in
lilly
but
she
had
to
talk
what
the
matter
with
her
tell
me
she
breathed
he
hesitated
my
landlady
swore
me
to
silence
but
you
mine
now
you
will
keep
the
secret
her
daughter
her
one
child
ran
away
four
months
ago
and
gave
birth
to
a
baby
the
mother
went
to
fetch
her
back
home
she
been
hovering
between
life
and
death
for
six
weeks
she
at
last
getting
better
poor
thing
said
lilly
and
then
the
consciousness
of
her
own
misery
came
upon
her
with
redoubled
force
konni
konni
she
moaned
on
his
neck
now
it
all
over
i
was
willing
to
starve
with
you
go
begging
with
you
but
what
the
use
when
once
you
know
everything
that
ca
be
so
very
bad
darling
about
me
about
my
life
my
past
with
a
little
jerk
he
freed
himself
and
sat
down
opposite
her
the
look
of
questioning
and
terrified
presentiment
that
congealed
his
pale
face
seeming
to
turn
it
into
a
mask
filled
her
with
fright
such
fright
as
she
had
never
experienced
because
it
was
not
on
her
own
behalf
she
was
afraid
of
converting
her
own
pain
into
his
pain
i
wanted
to
write
it
to
you
just
the
way
it
was
but
i
could
it
turned
out
wrong
while
i
wrote
so
i
came
to
you
before
morning
if
you
want
i
will
tell
you
now
everything
she
could
not
continue
she
turned
her
face
aside
and
buried
it
on
the
desk
why
do
you
speak
konrad
had
quite
forgotten
the
need
for
quiet
and
both
of
them
shrank
at
the
sudden
sound
of
his
voice
she
probably
asleep
he
said
lowering
his
voice
again
now
tell
me
what
can
it
be
he
breathed
heavily
under
the
growing
oppression
of
his
soul
she
began
to
speak
in
a
whisper
her
upper
body
inclined
toward
him
she
tried
to
tell
him
the
things
for
which
she
had
not
been
able
to
find
words
in
her
own
home
the
truth
did
not
come
out
this
time
either
she
felt
it
less
much
less
of
it
than
her
letters
would
have
given
him
to
distress
him
with
every
detail
never
no
power
in
the
world
could
have
driven
her
to
that
her
life
became
a
long
list
of
martyrdoms
a
funeral
procession
draped
in
black
insults
humiliations
mortifications
an
imprisonment
without
a
ray
of
light
or
mercy
and
all
the
time
a
constant
struggle
for
deliverance
a
noble
withdrawal
into
herself
a
dismal
sacrifice
for
nothing
she
talked
and
talked
he
listened
with
eyes
but
when
she
uttered
the
name
she
had
no
right
to
omit
salmoni
he
started
and
shrank
back
both
of
them
had
completely
forgotten
the
sick
girl
in
the
next
room
sometimes
lilly
had
to
wipe
tears
away
sometimes
she
grew
indignant
now
she
ventured
to
glide
by
difficult
points
now
she
lingered
over
touching
it
the
truth
after
all
she
said
to
herself
defiantly
yet
in
fear
as
she
drew
near
the
end
of
her
narrative
it
was
the
truth
in
so
far
as
it
was
a
résumé
of
the
good
in
her
the
truth
as
it
might
take
shape
in
his
troubled
mind
regardless
of
fact
and
this
truth
too
had
its
rights
silence
ensued
her
guilty
look
glided
past
him
and
rested
on
the
photograph
on
the
desk
which
leered
at
her
with
its
crafty
worldly
eyes
as
if
to
say
my
child
i
know
you
much
better
than
you
do
yourself
something
familiar
and
confidential
lay
in
them
like
a
reflection
of
the
merry
world
which
a
moment
ago
had
seemed
to
her
the
abode
of
torture
she
did
not
venture
to
remove
her
gaze
from
those
omniscient
eyes
which
smilingly
examined
and
disrobed
her
and
killed
her
last
shy
hope
the
unbroken
silence
in
the
room
became
a
burden
suddenly
konrad
and
lilly
heard
a
low
moan
it
came
from
the
next
room
where
the
sick
girl
lay
who
because
of
her
secret
sin
had
been
wrestling
with
her
poor
life
for
weeks
the
next
instant
the
sound
was
partially
stifled
as
if
she
had
stuck
a
handkerchief
into
her
mouth
then
it
broke
out
again
all
the
more
violently
anxious
words
of
comfort
mingled
with
the
groans
they
came
from
the
mother
who
probably
slept
in
the
farther
room
and
had
come
in
to
find
out
the
cause
of
her
daughter
outburst
of
grief
konrad
and
lilly
eyes
met
she
heard
everything
their
look
said
for
a
brief
instant
the
stranger
unhappiness
caused
them
to
forget
their
own
the
great
flood
of
the
world
suffering
poured
over
them
easing
the
sting
of
guilt
and
drowning
their
personal
pain
the
sobbing
in
the
next
room
was
muffled
under
pillows
my
own
darling
the
comforting
voice
implored
and
each
tone
swelled
with
love
do
worry
it
is
so
bad
we
will
take
the
little
baby
even
if
he
does
marry
you
what
difference
does
it
make
think
of
it
we
have
the
baby
and
then
it
will
smile
at
you
and
say
mama
you
see
it
is
so
dreadful
the
sobbing
quieted
down
and
turned
into
a
heavy
breathing
the
first
earnest
of
peace
oh
thought
lilly
it
must
be
good
to
have
someone
say
not
so
dreadful
nobody
would
say
that
to
her
a
burning
desire
to
be
petted
and
comforted
like
the
young
sinner
next
door
arose
in
her
she
has
her
mother
she
groaned
bursting
into
tears
but
whom
have
i
konrad
leaned
over
and
took
her
hands
from
her
face
his
troubled
eyes
shone
with
such
infinite
loving
kindness
that
they
seemed
not
to
be
of
this
world
am
i
not
here
he
asked
what
can
you
do
for
me
she
complained
how
can
you
bear
me
there
were
no
sounds
from
the
other
room
any
more
now
the
mother
also
knew
that
konrad
had
a
visitor
at
that
late
hour
listen
he
whispered
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
again
we
talk
much
more
besides
my
head
in
a
whirl
but
there
one
thing
i
see
clearly
how
ridiculous
everything
called
guilt
is
when
two
people
love
each
other
and
when
one
has
suffered
like
you
you
have
always
been
a
saint
to
me
and
you
shall
continue
to
be
in
the
future
future
lilly
faltered
starting
up
anxiously
what
sort
of
a
future
he
wiped
his
forehead
yellow
and
dank
with
sweat
i
do
know
he
said
all
i
know
is
i
ca
live
without
you
she
closed
her
eyes
she
wanted
to
dream
longer
to
be
sure
it
can
not
be
what
we
wanted
she
noticed
the
hesitating
dragging
gait
of
his
speech
everything
of
course
will
have
to
be
different
your
life
must
not
be
different
it
ought
not
to
be
different
you
ca
blink
facts
darling
of
course
i
do
know
we
will
live
but
we
manage
to
find
some
spot
on
the
globe
where
nobody
knows
us
now
she
understood
and
forgetting
herself
and
the
sick
girl
and
everything
around
she
sank
down
at
his
feet
with
a
cry
and
sobbed
i
do
want
you
to
you
must
you
entirely
too
young
you
know
the
world
you
do
know
what
you
doing
i
do
want
the
sacrifice
i
do
want
to
ruin
you
i
love
you
too
much
for
that
he
bent
her
head
back
and
stroked
her
hair
from
her
forehead
if
only
his
eyes
had
not
shone
with
that
suffering
loving
kindness
the
unhappiness
of
a
lifetime
already
glowed
in
them
if
the
question
of
sacrifice
enters
he
said
then
must
ask
a
sacrifice
of
will
you
make
it
for
my
sake
everything
everything
shall
i
die
tell
me
i
want
only
one
thing
of
you
come
to
me
as
you
are
do
bring
a
single
possession
of
yours
with
you
never
return
not
once
to
your
to
that
apartment
from
this
moment
on
nothing
of
all
that
is
to
be
will
you
promise
me
lilly
battled
against
violent
alarm
not
to
return
home
never
to
see
her
dear
again
never
to
feed
the
little
canary
or
peter
never
an
ugly
feeling
that
such
a
sacrifice
was
rank
folly
came
and
went
again
as
if
a
daub
of
dirt
had
been
flung
upon
her
and
immediately
been
wiped
away
then
she
decided
hastily
and
replied
yes
i
promise
he
drew
a
deep
breath
now
we
will
be
perfectly
quiet
he
said
the
patient
ought
to
sleep
and
morning
i
explain
the
matter
to
my
landlady
but
what
is
to
become
of
your
great
work
lilly
asked
rising
up
in
her
again
a
melancholy
smile
passed
over
his
face
who
knows
that
will
depend
upon
my
uncle
if
he
gives
his
consent
we
can
live
as
we
please
everything
will
be
all
right
but
if
he
does
konrad
right
hand
which
had
been
gliding
ceaselessly
from
her
forehead
to
the
nape
of
her
neck
for
an
instant
pressed
her
head
painfully
as
if
to
fetch
strength
for
the
approaching
life
struggle
from
closer
contact
that
will
be
all
right
too
he
said
and
smiled
again
a
little
while
later
she
lay
at
his
side
in
the
narrow
bed
the
edge
of
which
cut
her
body
she
put
her
head
under
his
shoulder
and
with
both
arms
clasped
his
body
as
always
in
her
distress
when
she
sought
protection
with
him
but
this
time
she
slept
and
he
kept
watch
chapter
xix
laue
was
not
a
little
astonished
when
one
day
her
former
tenant
the
appeared
at
her
door
in
an
alpaca
suit
and
a
sailor
hat
trimmed
with
a
green
band
begging
for
admittance
the
young
lady
tenant
of
the
year
had
just
been
married
and
the
best
room
was
vacant
thus
it
came
about
that
laue
red
plush
furniture
once
more
cast
a
fiery
glow
upon
lilly
life
the
photographs
of
famous
mimes
smirked
upon
her
patronisingly
and
while
performing
her
morning
toilet
she
was
admonished
to
keep
your
body
clean
be
sure
to
have
your
conscience
just
as
pure
the
way
konrad
looked
out
for
her
was
touching
he
instantly
drew
all
his
money
from
the
bank
five
hundred
marks
and
himself
went
to
buy
an
outfit
for
her
since
she
could
not
appear
on
the
street
in
the
garments
she
had
worn
when
she
had
come
to
him
he
had
let
the
salesladies
persuade
him
into
buying
the
absurdest
things
lilly
would
have
split
her
sides
laughing
over
them
if
they
had
not
represented
a
goodly
portion
of
his
money
the
shoddy
dress
struck
her
as
a
temporary
masquerade
and
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
her
to
wear
it
outside
the
house
laue
shook
her
head
dubiously
when
you
moved
away
from
here
four
years
ago
you
had
the
finest
gowns
and
brooches
and
bracelets
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
now
you
come
back
in
rags
it
seems
to
me
you
on
the
wrong
road
lilly
dear
konrad
found
as
little
favour
in
laue
eyes
he
too
young
for
you
and
not
stylish
enough
maybe
he
has
ideal
sentiments
if
he
had
he
would
snap
his
fingers
at
you
but
i
tell
you
ideal
sentiments
always
go
hand
in
hand
with
trouble
lilly
thought
the
old
woman
chatter
abominable
but
for
lack
of
something
better
to
do
during
the
daytime
konrad
was
busy
and
could
not
come
until
evening
she
again
took
to
pasting
flowers
in
company
occasionally
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
never
gone
away
from
her
lilly
had
written
to
adele
the
very
first
day
without
of
course
mentioning
her
address
she
told
her
not
to
be
troubled
by
her
absence
and
to
attend
to
the
apartment
as
usual
until
dehnicke
return
it
was
more
difficult
to
pen
her
farewell
to
her
old
friend
she
said
nothing
of
konrad
for
the
present
her
engagement
was
to
be
kept
a
secret
she
gave
as
the
sole
cause
for
her
flight
her
irresistible
desire
at
last
to
live
a
different
life
she
also
referred
to
her
wish
not
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
future
and
wound
up
with
cordial
words
which
robbed
separation
of
its
bitterness
when
she
read
the
letter
over
she
felt
a
genuine
pang
at
which
she
was
a
bit
ashamed
the
days
passed
the
new
life
that
had
been
the
dream
of
her
dreams
for
years
had
begun
freighted
with
boundless
confidence
such
as
she
had
not
ventured
to
hope
for
in
her
wildest
fancyings
with
her
sins
washed
away
redeemed
reborn
she
stepped
back
into
virtuous
society
at
the
side
of
the
beloved
man
whom
only
a
few
days
before
it
would
have
been
arrogance
sacrilege
to
wish
to
possess
who
would
have
believed
it
and
yet
lilly
was
unable
to
attain
to
perfect
enjoyment
of
her
unspeakable
happiness
no
matter
how
often
she
told
herself
it
was
nothing
but
a
transition
period
soon
to
pass
the
misery
of
her
old
quarters
the
odour
the
spiritual
mustiness
that
pervaded
the
place
bad
food
the
lack
of
suitable
clothes
money
and
service
all
this
worked
upon
her
sufficiently
to
delude
her
into
the
belief
that
instead
of
rising
to
new
honours
she
was
suddenly
sinking
from
splendour
and
brilliance
to
a
dull
dead
level
no
matter
that
she
found
fault
with
herself
for
this
ungrateful
frame
of
mind
the
fact
was
the
feeling
was
there
and
she
could
not
dismiss
it
and
how
account
for
it
that
five
years
before
when
she
had
descended
from
the
genuine
heights
of
life
delicately
nurtured
a
spoiled
darling
accustomed
to
luxury
and
attention
such
as
is
granted
to
few
persons
in
the
world
she
had
scarcely
suffered
from
the
wretchedness
of
these
surroundings
in
fact
though
utterly
without
prospects
she
had
felt
tolerably
secure
but
now
that
the
idle
comfort
of
a
vapid
existence
fortunately
lay
behind
her
and
her
beloved
walked
by
her
side
ready
to
throw
open
the
gates
to
a
happiness
she
had
never
divined
she
was
unable
to
breathe
among
the
red
plush
chairs
trifles
annoyed
her
and
she
hankered
for
a
bathroom
and
a
hairdresser
something
must
have
departed
from
her
during
those
years
she
thought
and
thought
but
failed
to
discover
what
it
was
added
to
all
these
troubles
was
her
worry
over
konrad
condition
whenever
her
soul
conjured
up
his
image
her
heart
throbbed
with
mingled
sensations
secret
pangs
of
conscience
longings
for
atonement
reproaches
not
to
be
stilled
of
herself
and
why
conceal
it
of
konrad
also
her
yearning
for
him
no
longer
had
a
quality
of
joyousness
and
yet
she
was
ever
expectant
of
a
letter
from
him
by
the
pneumatic
tube
if
he
wrote
he
said
too
little
and
if
he
sent
no
message
at
all
she
felt
angry
though
she
well
knew
he
had
not
a
second
to
spare
for
her
during
the
day
and
was
drudging
as
never
before
in
his
life
he
would
come
at
last
between
eight
and
nine
in
the
evening
and
then
loaded
with
papers
and
books
he
had
manuscripts
to
read
proofs
to
look
over
and
letters
to
answer
he
scarcely
took
time
to
eat
and
while
he
snatched
a
few
bites
troubled
recollections
of
things
he
had
forgotten
during
the
day
kept
flashing
up
in
his
harassed
brain
there
was
no
thought
of
amorous
nights
as
a
rule
konrad
fell
asleep
in
the
midst
of
work
as
he
reclined
there
in
the
corner
of
the
sofa
lilly
could
appreciate
how
tired
and
worn
he
was
he
no
longer
cared
for
his
person
his
clothes
hung
on
him
impressed
and
in
place
of
the
velvety
sheen
on
his
cheeks
which
had
been
her
delight
she
saw
dark
boils
and
coarse
stubble
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
learn
what
he
thought
of
her
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
but
she
could
extract
nothing
from
him
he
remained
mute
with
glowing
eyes
and
lips
tightly
compressed
certainly
she
had
no
right
to
doubt
him
she
knew
that
he
spent
every
spare
minute
trying
to
arrange
for
their
life
in
the
future
in
buenos
ayres
the
position
of
a
high
school
teacher
of
german
was
vacant
the
same
in
caracas
and
he
could
even
become
a
university
professor
though
of
course
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
all
he
needed
to
do
was
present
a
few
letters
of
recommendation
from
professors
such
efforts
however
were
necessary
only
in
case
his
uncle
refused
his
consent
to
konrad
marriage
with
lilly
and
dropped
his
disobedient
heir
if
he
said
yes
if
he
furnished
the
means
for
their
household
they
could
live
aloof
from
the
world
wherever
they
wished
wherever
conditions
were
best
adapted
for
the
precious
work
konrad
had
immediately
written
to
his
uncle
about
his
engagement
and
told
of
lilly
past
in
the
most
touching
words
he
had
not
concealed
the
stains
on
her
life
but
he
brought
out
strongly
her
fine
qualities
the
virginity
of
her
soul
her
nobility
her
rich
intellectual
endowments
the
number
of
her
ideal
interests
after
he
had
sent
off
the
letter
he
read
to
lilly
a
few
passages
from
the
draught
of
it
it
was
a
bold
document
of
revolutionary
ideas
i
know
that
and
you
too
are
raised
above
the
narrow
conventions
of
philistinism
above
the
merciless
judgments
of
social
above
a
pharisaism
which
constitutes
itself
the
watchdog
of
morality
and
which
with
its
code
of
formal
pedantic
family
relationships
knocks
to
the
ground
all
aspirations
for
free
conduct
you
have
lived
in
many
parts
of
the
world
and
you
have
learned
to
know
how
mutable
moral
laws
are
everywhere
how
hollow
the
pretence
of
regarding
each
as
the
sole
dogma
you
know
the
sly
hypocritical
paths
and
by
which
one
manages
to
escape
their
tyranny
and
you
know
that
in
the
province
of
ethics
there
is
only
one
thing
which
commands
respect
and
admiration
the
will
to
to
that
form
of
life
in
which
the
noblemen
of
all
times
combined
the
beautiful
with
the
good
yes
beautiful
and
good
that
is
what
lilly
is
her
aspirations
and
sufferings
how
glorious
who
could
be
dull
enough
to
resist
such
words
that
is
what
lilly
said
to
comfort
konrad
when
uncertainty
as
to
the
immediate
future
weighed
upon
him
heavily
five
days
passed
before
the
answer
came
upon
which
depended
the
weal
or
woe
of
two
human
beings
in
reading
it
lilly
saw
the
crafty
eyes
of
the
photograph
turned
upon
her
as
if
the
old
man
stood
there
in
person
my
dear
boy
i
do
understand
anything
about
or
similar
phrases
it
nearly
half
a
century
ago
since
i
ran
away
from
school
but
i
flatter
myself
that
i
can
measure
things
pretty
accurately
with
my
eyes
and
size
people
up
by
their
faces
whether
striking
a
bargain
or
on
the
yoshiwara
whether
on
the
various
exchanges
or
at
baccarat
which
did
not
keep
me
from
being
fleeced
or
my
life
from
being
a
series
of
stupidities
especially
in
regard
to
women
once
i
wanted
whether
or
no
to
bring
along
a
young
circassian
because
her
eyebrows
met
prettily
and
once
i
wanted
to
marry
a
little
musme
because
she
massaged
my
legs
so
well
etc
i
wo
say
anything
of
my
various
attempts
to
save
souls
because
everybody
goes
through
that
however
the
god
of
old
rogues
and
bachelors
perhaps
with
your
classical
knowledge
you
can
tell
me
his
name
mercifully
kept
any
of
my
plans
from
maturing
but
your
case
seems
to
be
essentially
different
if
it
really
as
you
say
if
your
betrothed
is
really
such
a
paragon
of
virtues
the
world
is
full
of
surprises
and
chief
of
all
if
she
does
not
pose
as
a
repentant
magdalene
and
bank
upon
your
pity
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
to
tweak
mr
nose
and
give
you
my
cordial
blessing
but
if
your
intentions
bear
a
certain
family
resemblance
to
my
own
in
the
past
then
pardon
me
if
i
refuse
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
for
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
your
future
even
with
this
in
view
and
if
i
feel
compelled
to
beg
you
kindly
to
break
off
your
connections
with
me
in
order
to
settle
the
matter
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
will
be
in
berlin
day
after
and
i
herewith
ask
you
and
your
betrothed
to
keep
the
evening
free
for
your
old
uncle
as
i
do
not
know
where
you
metropolitans
dine
and
drink
i
will
have
to
let
you
know
the
place
of
our
meeting
after
i
reach
berlin
until
then
yours
faithfully
uncle
rennschmidt
for
the
first
time
in
that
gloomy
period
lilly
saw
konrad
face
relax
with
a
smile
of
relief
if
that
his
attitude
then
there
no
danger
he
said
he
will
have
to
drop
his
distrust
at
the
very
first
glance
who
in
the
world
can
withstand
you
you
just
have
to
be
a
little
pleasant
to
him
and
be
your
adorer
but
lilly
had
her
private
opinion
yes
if
she
had
her
former
wardrobe
to
choose
from
perhaps
she
might
be
sure
of
presenting
the
appearance
she
should
to
his
uncle
but
in
either
one
of
her
two
ridiculous
dresses
which
she
had
to
pin
painstakingly
before
she
could
wear
them
without
jewellery
or
the
thousand
little
appurtenances
of
a
fine
toilet
from
where
in
such
circumstances
was
she
to
summon
the
that
would
force
the
shrewd
old
woman
connoisseur
to
capitulate
i
afraid
i
have
to
have
some
of
your
money
for
getting
an
evening
costume
she
said
hesitatingly
he
acquiesced
with
pleasure
she
was
to
have
whatever
she
still
needed
and
a
hat
with
plumes
and
a
lace
mantilla
just
like
the
one
she
had
had
all
this
for
two
hundred
and
sixty
marks
this
the
entire
sum
he
had
left
was
what
he
handed
over
to
her
for
her
new
purchases
the
dear
boy
what
sort
of
an
idea
did
he
have
of
fashionable
dressing
after
he
left
she
carefully
considered
ways
and
means
while
she
wore
herself
out
devising
methods
of
patching
up
some
sort
of
costume
the
most
glorious
dresses
hung
by
the
dozens
in
her
old
closets
dresses
which
konrad
had
not
seen
because
he
had
never
gone
to
any
festive
gathering
with
her
the
lace
mantilla
which
had
cost
a
small
fortune
was
also
there
and
goodness
knows
what
else
but
with
all
her
might
she
cast
the
temptation
from
her
she
had
given
him
her
word
of
honour
she
might
deceive
everybody
else
in
the
world
but
not
konrad
so
she
decided
to
go
on
a
shopping
expedition
the
next
morning
and
see
whether
she
could
not
ferret
out
a
good
garment
at
gerson
or
wertheim
in
the
reduced
stock
but
she
was
known
in
the
shops
and
the
salespeople
had
had
the
experience
that
despite
her
economy
she
always
bought
nothing
but
the
very
best
how
they
would
stare
if
she
appeared
at
the
counter
in
her
tawdry
trash
no
with
the
best
intentions
she
could
not
place
herself
in
so
distressing
a
situation
she
pondered
a
long
time
but
her
thoughts
kept
returning
to
those
wardrobes
where
her
exquisite
treasures
reposed
and
silently
offered
a
wide
choice
but
nowhere
a
little
back
door
to
slip
through
nowhere
a
pretext
for
lessening
the
gravity
of
the
offence
despite
all
these
vexations
the
night
passed
in
caressing
dreams
lighted
by
newly
arisen
hope
and
as
always
when
lilly
frame
of
mind
in
sleep
was
healthy
she
felt
she
was
being
peacefully
rocked
to
the
rhythm
of
familiar
melodies
she
recognised
the
moonlight
sonata
and
grieg
ung
birken
and
the
motifs
of
the
rhine
daughters
and
mingling
with
them
all
the
song
of
songs
as
she
was
coming
out
of
her
sleep
in
the
morning
she
still
heard
come
my
beloved
let
us
go
forth
into
the
field
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
of
fright
she
sat
up
in
bed
the
song
of
songs
the
score
her
treasure
her
legacy
where
was
it
in
the
secrétaire
buried
forgotten
not
to
have
thought
of
it
once
now
there
was
no
possibility
of
abiding
by
her
promise
if
she
had
kept
her
wits
about
her
that
momentous
night
she
would
never
have
given
it
she
had
been
at
a
loss
for
a
pretext
and
here
she
had
a
justification
she
did
not
experience
the
slightest
pangs
of
conscience
it
was
a
sacred
cause
that
she
was
upholding
by
eight
she
was
already
on
her
way
to
her
former
home
the
sunny
haze
of
the
red
august
morning
floated
up
to
the
heavens
sooty
drops
fell
from
the
yellowing
trees
and
the
wires
of
the
electric
trams
sang
their
stormy
song
lilly
joined
the
group
of
people
at
the
nearest
stopping
place
which
from
minute
to
minute
waxed
and
dwindled
while
waiting
for
a
car
to
convey
her
to
the
distant
west
side
she
looked
about
in
all
directions
to
see
whether
by
chance
konrad
was
coming
down
the
street
in
the
car
she
sat
with
a
newspaper
held
close
to
her
face
and
on
the
short
path
along
the
canal
she
slipped
from
tree
to
tree
like
a
wild
animal
seeking
cover
at
last
she
reached
her
house
the
porter
who
was
sweeping
the
front
greeted
her
with
a
shout
of
surprise
the
smiled
a
mischievous
greeting
up
to
her
from
his
cellar
door
and
his
two
urchins
in
whose
mind
lilly
was
connected
with
sweets
hung
to
her
skirt
with
happy
little
noises
all
this
instantly
produced
a
sensation
of
returning
home
adele
was
still
asleep
why
should
she
not
be
she
had
nothing
to
do
when
she
opened
the
door
she
showed
the
greatest
delight
she
even
wept
great
tears
and
lilly
suddenly
realised
what
she
was
losing
in
her
everything
shone
spick
and
span
in
the
morning
sunlight
even
the
flowers
had
been
kept
watered
the
canary
beat
his
wings
by
way
of
greeting
and
peter
wanted
to
break
the
bars
of
his
cage
to
reach
lilly
shoulder
she
did
not
know
to
whom
or
to
what
to
turn
first
from
sheer
love
nor
what
question
to
ask
first
three
letters
and
two
telegrams
lay
on
the
card
tray
the
letters
were
in
richard
writing
the
telegrams
were
directed
to
adele
and
urgently
inquired
for
lilly
address
but
after
sending
these
missives
dehnicke
adele
informed
her
had
given
up
his
affairs
in
harzburg
and
returned
to
berlin
he
had
inserted
advertisements
for
her
in
the
papers
and
came
every
day
at
the
usual
hour
to
find
out
if
they
had
met
with
success
then
he
sat
on
his
customary
seat
very
quiet
drinking
tea
and
smoking
cigarettes
until
the
time
for
returning
to
his
office
did
you
tell
him
about
dr
rennschmidt
what
do
you
think
of
me
czepanek
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
how
to
look
out
for
my
mistress
honour
but
the
best
thing
would
be
if
you
were
to
come
back
and
behave
as
if
nothing
had
happened
that
what
all
my
ladies
used
to
do
lilly
asked
her
to
fetch
from
the
basement
the
smaller
of
the
two
leather
trunks
explaining
that
she
wished
to
take
a
few
of
her
old
possessions
with
her
after
adele
had
swung
herself
out
of
the
room
sulking
lilly
gathered
up
konrad
letters
from
the
secret
drawer
in
which
she
had
hidden
them
and
then
ran
hastily
to
her
large
wardrobe
from
which
she
pulled
out
all
her
dresses
and
threw
them
on
the
bed
in
order
to
select
whatever
might
be
of
use
to
her
at
last
the
song
of
songs
occurred
to
her
she
opened
the
secrétaire
the
score
which
had
dreamed
away
its
aimless
existence
for
years
in
the
back
part
of
the
lowest
drawer
had
acquired
a
strange
aspect
the
rubber
band
about
it
was
sticky
and
fell
to
bits
when
lilly
wanted
to
undo
the
roll
the
sheets
glided
from
her
hand
and
flew
over
the
carpet
one
by
one
there
they
all
lay
the
arias
and
recitatives
the
duos
and
orchestral
interludes
mingled
and
confused
and
on
top
the
turtle
dove
solo
for
the
clarionet
which
she
had
sung
with
her
mother
while
still
a
lisping
babe
she
looked
at
the
scattered
leaves
in
dismay
they
had
turned
yellow
and
mouldy
many
of
them
were
plastered
with
blood
her
own
blood
which
had
squirted
from
the
knife
wound
her
mother
had
inflicted
and
covered
large
spots
with
black
and
reddish
brown
stains
some
of
the
stains
had
been
eaten
into
holes
the
work
of
the
mice
at
lischnitz
so
there
it
was
her
song
of
songs
nevermore
any
hope
no
rock
of
salvation
for
the
future
no
faithful
eckhardt
in
life
stress
and
no
guide
to
golden
heights
a
mere
remnant
worn
though
unused
honourable
ballast
which
one
drags
along
for
unknown
reasons
a
light
extinguished
a
piece
of
wisdom
without
sense
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
kneeled
on
the
floor
and
gathered
up
the
thin
rolls
hastily
without
regard
for
their
order
i
can
arrange
them
some
other
time
she
thought
though
a
faint
doubt
arose
within
her
whether
she
ever
would
adele
came
with
the
trunk
it
had
taken
her
an
extraordinary
length
of
time
she
replied
to
lilly
questions
in
a
confused
way
and
glanced
at
the
clock
furtively
she
opened
the
trunk
lid
and
lilly
threw
the
score
on
the
bottom
the
empty
open
trunk
was
like
a
mouth
gaping
for
fodder
the
clothes
lay
spread
on
the
bed
her
shoes
stood
next
to
the
washstand
hats
veils
blouses
lace
mantillas
silk
petticoats
all
waited
and
seemed
to
cry
take
me
along
for
an
instant
lilly
closed
her
eyes
and
groaned
remembering
the
sacrifice
the
only
one
he
demanded
of
her
but
it
had
to
be
both
his
and
her
future
depended
on
it
laue
will
hide
them
for
me
and
she
can
keep
them
afterwards
she
thought
she
made
her
decision
blindly
she
gathered
up
whatever
her
hands
fell
upon
in
addition
to
her
dresses
the
ivory
toilet
articles
with
the
seven
pointed
coronet
the
triple
hand
mirror
the
powder
box
the
receipt
for
her
furs
in
the
storage
house
and
numberless
little
de
she
did
not
forget
her
jewellery
either
in
case
needs
some
money
she
thought
she
sent
adele
to
order
a
cab
this
time
again
it
was
an
eternity
before
she
returned
the
porter
helped
carry
the
trunk
down
and
two
hat
boxes
dangled
in
adele
free
hand
one
more
caress
of
the
canary
greyish
green
wings
one
more
kiss
on
the
monkey
velvety
snout
then
the
door
closed
behind
her
forever
wo
you
leave
an
address
what
a
secretive
air
adele
wore
i
will
write
to
you
adele
and
sometime
i
hope
you
will
come
to
me
again
adele
did
not
respond
but
looked
down
the
street
expectantly
a
minute
later
lilly
glancing
from
the
hansom
window
as
she
was
being
driven
along
the
canal
saw
a
taxicab
whizz
past
from
the
opposite
direction
in
that
second
she
recognised
richard
seated
inside
red
as
a
lobster
his
head
inclined
to
one
side
he
stared
ahead
of
him
with
wild
searching
eyes
at
the
house
she
had
just
left
she
hastily
told
the
coachman
to
turn
down
a
side
street
she
must
not
meet
richard
until
her
fate
had
been
decided
before
the
world
but
in
a
few
moments
her
heart
throbbing
she
heard
behind
her
the
rattle
and
clatter
that
had
just
died
down
in
the
distance
it
grew
louder
and
louder
the
yellow
wall
of
the
taxicab
shot
by
turned
about
suddenly
and
stopped
a
man
voice
called
to
lilly
driver
and
her
cab
was
also
brought
to
a
stop
richard
was
standing
close
to
her
holding
the
open
door
in
his
trembling
hand
where
are
you
going
his
voice
shrilled
in
a
feminine
falsetto
his
adam
apple
rose
and
fell
convulsively
over
his
high
collar
lilly
felt
quite
calm
quite
equal
to
the
situation
he
who
had
so
long
been
her
lord
and
master
now
seemed
like
a
poor
helpless
shadow
if
you
please
richard
let
me
ride
on
she
said
i
took
leave
of
you
in
my
letter
i
just
came
to
fetch
a
few
of
my
things
and
now
over
between
us
why
should
we
go
on
tormenting
each
other
come
back
he
hissed
why
should
i
come
back
i
say
you
know
where
your
home
is
i
wo
let
you
stray
about
in
the
world
any
more
heaven
knows
what
may
happen
to
you
driver
turn
back
the
coachman
turned
his
russet
face
inquiringly
to
the

alluding
to
the
american
heiress

the
devil

way
i
felt
for
some
time
but
you
come
back

must

back

you
he
grasped
the
hem
of
her
skirt
with
both
hands
as
if
to
drag
her
from
the
carriage
by
her
clothes
i
beg
you
to
come
back

ca

i
so
used
to
you
if
i
had
married
i
should
have
come
to
you
directly
after
the
wedding
our
relationship
would
have
changed
an
iota
and
everything
in
your
apartment
is
just
as
you
left
it
you
saw
it
adele
says
peter

adele

worried

god

between

apartment
and
the
stable
and
if
you
want
i
buy
an
automobile
a
thousand
times
finer
than
this
one
that
was
the
highest
trump
no
one
could
outbid
an
automobile
so
he
stopped
to
see
the
effect
kneeling
on
the
steps
he
leaned
far
into
the
hansom
and
stared
into
her
face
lilly
realised
she
could
not
free
herself
from
him
unless
he
learned
the
truth
she
felt
very
sorry
for
him
but
it
had
to
be
listen
richard
what
you
offer
does
count
with
me
anymore
because
i
love
another
man
who
wants
to
give
me
much
more
than
you
what
i
like
to
know
what
sort
of
a
young
vanderbilt
he
is
he
cried
in
jealous
scorn
why
i
never
knew
side
of
your
nature
he
not
a
young
vanderbilt
richard
on
the
contrary
he
so
poor
he
does
know
where
he
get
his
bread
from
day
to
day
but
i
am
engaged
to
him
and
as
his
affianced
i
will
have
to
ask
you
to
stand
out
of
my
way
his
mouth
gaped
his
eyes
grew
large
and
round
he
reeled
back
against
the
hindwheels
of
the
taxicab
go
on
lilly
cried
to
the
coachman
she
leaned
back
in
her
seat
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
relief
though
with
a
faint
consciousness
of
guilt
as
if
she
had
rid
herself
of
her
old
lover
too
lightly
throughout
the
ride
she
heard
back
of
her
the
of
a
automobile
and
when
she
descended
from
her
hansom
richard
descended
from
the
taxicab
at
a
slight
distance
though
near
enough
for
lilly
to
catch
the
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
the
look
of
a
whipped
dog
as
if
someone
were
pursuing
her
she
ran
up
the
four
flights
without
concerning
herself
about
the
trunk
but
a
little
while
later
the
driver
came
panting
up
the
stairs
with
it
apparently
of
his
own
accord
when
she
held
out
the
money
to
him
he
refused
it
the
gentleman
downstairs
he
said
had
already
paid
for
everything
chapter
xx
it
was
the
evening
of
the
following
day
the
carriage
that
was
taking
lilly
to
the
dreaded
meeting
stopped
in
front
of
the
renowned
linden
restaurant
which
has
been
the
resort
of
elegant
folk
for
years
although
it
was
some
time
since
lilly
had
been
there
she
knew
every
stone
of
it
she
knew
albert
too
the
tall
dignified
porter
who
stood
in
the
doorway
and
put
his
hand
to
his
braided
cap
it
was
he
who
had
acted
as
the
for
her
and
the
handsome
hussar
of
the
guards
with
downcast
eyes
pressing
close
to
konrad
she
passed
by
him
hoping
he
no
longer
remembered
her
this
is
lilly
uncle
an
old
gentleman
slightly
under
medium
size
in
an
jacket
and
crumpled
collar
came
shambling
out
of
a
back
room
and
held
out
a
broad
fleshy
hand
the
brown
skin
of
which
played
loosely
over
his
bones
like
a
large
glove
lilly
threw
a
timid
glance
of
scrutiny
at
the
person
whom
she
had
pictured
to
herself
as
a
commanding
yet
complaisant
thunderer
in
reality
he
was
a
tottering
rotund
somewhat
gnome
when
she
told
herself
that
her
conduct
now
and
during
the
next
hour
would
decide
konrad
and
her
own
future
the
old
miserable
timidity
which
had
not
troubled
her
for
some
time
past
began
to
paralyse
her
muscles
and
turned
her
into
a
doll
which
smiled
inanely
and
could
not
tell
its
own
name
but
the
old
uncle
also
seemed
to
have
lost
his
power
of
speech
he
looked
her
up
and
down
repeatedly
and
forgot
to
invite
her
to
enter
the
back
room
as
with
everything
else
about
the
place
lilly
was
familiar
with
this
back
room
its
pressed
leather
walls
its
red
silk
hangings
and
the
blue
oriental
rugs
over
the
sofa
in
the
period
when
richard
was
still
possessed
of
the
ambition
to
belong
to
the
aristocracy
of
high
livers
she
had
spent
many
a
mad
hour
there
late
at
night
with
him
and
his
chance
friends
an
immaculate
waiter
helped
her
off
with
her
brocade
jacket
and
lace
mantilla
and
looked
at
her
the
while
as
if
to
say
i
ought
to
know
you
oh
that
was
a
moment
of
agony
the
uncle
who
had
not
ceased
furtively
to
cast
awed
yet
sullen
glances
at
lilly
pulled
himself
together
and
said
well
let
have
a
cosy
time
together
children
nice
and
pleasant
eh
lilly
inclined
her
head
her
gesture
was
stiff
enough
apparently
to
increase
the
old
gentleman
respect
he
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
and
tramped
about
the
room
played
with
the
gold
knobs
which
hung
as
a
charm
from
his
watch
pocket
and
two
or
three
times
nodded
his
solemn
appreciation
to
konrad
they
seated
themselves
at
the
gleaming
white
table
resplendent
with
flowers
and
cut
glass
about
the
bronze
lamp
lilly
remembered
it
with
its
claws
and
slim
lily
design
hung
a
veil
of
violet
orchids
which
had
surely
cost
an
enormous
sum
he
knew
how
to
live
the
old
untidy
rogue
one
had
to
admit
that
lilly
saw
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
opposite
her
seat
it
was
reassuringly
aristocratic
she
had
chosen
a
pleated
dress
of
black
liberty
silk
with
a
waist
of
chantilly
lace
which
despite
its
costliness
lay
in
simple
lines
of
grace
about
her
breast
and
arms
unsuspecting
spirits
might
believe
that
a
similar
costume
was
to
be
had
everywhere
from
san
francisco
to
petersburg
from
cape
town
to
christiania
for
two
hundred
marks
she
had
wisely
refrained
from
wearing
any
jewellery
except
the
thin
gold
chain
which
she
was
wont
to
wear
next
to
her
skin
it
encircled
her
high
collar
in
maidenly
modesty
she
looked
like
a
young
noblewoman
who
has
been
held
in
strict
seclusion
and
who
is
taking
her
first
look
into
the
great
world
with
shy
inquiring
eyes
his
uncle
had
assigned
the
seat
on
her
right
side
to
konrad
and
kept
the
place
nearest
the
door
for
himself
the
instant
he
took
his
seat
at
table
he
began
to
feel
somewhat
in
his
element
he
uttered
hoarse
ejaculations
and
gave
orders
and
was
dissatisfied
with
everything
see
here
boy
he
said
to
the
waiter
who
was
placing
the
on
the
table
do
you
call
that
the
right
kind
of
a
carafe
for
port
wine
do
you
know
that
if
port
wine
does
sparkle
in
the
carafe
it
takes
away
your
thirst
the
waiter
intimidated
by
his
snarling
wanted
to
go
off
in
search
of
another
carafe
but
rennschmidt
declared
he
could
not
wait
he
needed
a
starter
i
still
a
little
constrained
he
said
apologetically
i
not
accustomed
to
associating
with
such
beautiful
and
ungracious
ladies
lilly
felt
a
prick
at
her
heart
she
met
a
reproachful
look
from
her
lover
which
seemed
to
say
you
must
be
so
dumb
you
must
be
agreeable
to
him
in
the
same
mute
language
lilly
humbly
implored
his
forgiveness
i
ca
you
speak
for
me
in
his
anxiety
konrad
began
to
converse
as
if
he
had
been
paid
for
entertaining
them
he
described
the
collection
of
antiques
in
his
uncle
castle
on
the
rhine
touched
upon
the
competition
of
the
americans
and
passing
on
to
the
subject
of
art
in
italy
discussed
the
harmful
effects
of
the
lex
pacca
and
goodness
knows
what
else
it
was
a
highly
illuminating
little
discourse
which
his
uncle
seemed
to
follow
with
moderate
interest
while
squinting
at
lilly
and
smacking
his
lips
from
time
to
time
over
a
piece
of
canned
tunny
then
rennschmidt
said
all
very
true
and
edifying
my
son
but
could
you
also
impart
some
valuable
information
as
to
the
state
of
the
whiskey
in
this
place
konrad
jumped
up
to
pull
the
bell
rope
but
his
uncle
restrained
him
stop
stop
stop
this
is
my
affair
here
the
port
for
you
after
all
a
beautiful
woman
is
a
beautiful
woman
even
if
she
belongs
to
others
here
to
you
beautiful
woman
that
sounded
like
mockery
did
he
wish
to
make
sport
of
her
before
repulsing
her
in
fact
he
continued
addressing
lilly
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
you
already
worked
a
perceptible
change
in
him
i
see
he
already
dances
beautifully
to
your
tune
eh
whether
or
no
she
had
to
say
something
in
reply
i
do
play
tunes
and
he
does
dance
she
said
making
a
mighty
effort
to
pull
herself
together
we
not
free
enough
for
that
aha
there
one
straight
from
the
shoulder
for
me
he
laughed
but
his
laugh
sounded
resentful
lilly
did
mean
any
harm
konrad
interjected
coming
to
her
rescue
and
really
we
are
not
having
an
easy
time
of
it
if
lilly
helped
me
every
day
with
her
sweet
comprehension
i
do
think
my
strength
would
have
held
out
all
very
well
and
good
or
or
or
all
very
deplorable
but
your
old
uncle
has
gotten
even
a
look
from
her
as
advance
payment
on
our
future
relationship
oh
if
that
all
thought
lilly
and
raising
her
glass
to
touch
his
she
tried
to
thank
him
for
his
having
come
around
with
a
little
coquettish
shamefaced
smile
it
filled
him
with
evident
satisfaction
he
twisted
his
pointed
beard
and
ogled
her
confidentially
with
his
leering
eyes
as
if
to
extract
from
her
a
sign
of
secret
understanding
thank
goodness
maybe
he
not
so
dreadful
after
all
she
thought
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
as
she
felt
the
chains
of
her
embarrassment
loosening
a
bit
when
the
waiter
returned
a
grave
discussion
arose
between
him
and
rennschmidt
as
to
the
brands
of
whiskey
the
hotel
had
to
offer
it
was
a
long
parley
and
debate
ending
in
a
call
for
the
himself
who
went
down
into
the
cellar
to
hunt
up
a
bottle
he
thought
he
must
have
somewhere
with
the
label
of
a
certain
famous
house
and
the
date
of
a
certain
famous
year
at
length
rennschmidt
was
ready
again
to
bestow
his
attention
upon
his
beautiful
niece
to
be
i
a
sort
of
barnswallow
i
built
my
nest
of
mud
and
such
stuff
i
traded
in
guano
australian
blennies
pitch
and
other
more
or
less
unclean
things
so
you
ca
blame
me
for
wishing
to
recuperate
by
devoting
myself
to
appetizing
objects
such
as
you
my
ungracious
lady
all
i
wish
is
a
little
attention
in
return
oh
dear
thought
lilly
i
be
impertinent
for
once
so
she
said
rennschmidt
you
know
i
sitting
here
like
a
poor
trembling
student
going
up
for
the
examinations
i
beg
of
you
she
raised
her
clasped
hands
do
play
with
me
like
a
cat
with
a
mouse
she
had
struck
the
right
note
is
she
opening
her
mouth
at
last
he
cried
beaming
and
she
has
a
wonderful
little
snout
konrad
one
of
those
mice
snouts
with
long
teeth
in
which
the
upper
lip
says
to
the
lower
lip
you
do
come
and
kiss
i
run
away
is
it
so
konrad
you
stupid
fellow
eh
lilly
had
to
laugh
heartily
and
the
was
finally
concluded
and
for
a
moment
konrad
dear
tired
face
brightened
with
a
smile
of
reassurance
which
expanded
her
heart
as
with
a
reward
she
loved
him
so
dearly
she
could
have
thrown
herself
at
his
uncle
feet
for
his
sake
with
a
rising
sense
of
triumph
she
thought
he
shall
see
how
agreeable
i
can
be
to
that
old
horror
and
indeed
to
make
herself
agreeable
proved
to
be
not
so
very
excessive
a
task
when
she
looked
at
the
old
man
with
his
round
crumpled
roguish
face
his
darting
sly
little
grey
eyes
and
the
fine
wavy
diplomat
wig
it
actually
was
a
wig
sharply
defined
on
his
forehead
and
brushed
forward
into
locks
over
his
ears
she
felt
more
and
more
strongly
that
he
was
an
old
acquaintance
with
whom
she
had
many
a
time
played
pranks
and
to
whom
the
recollection
of
those
pranks
secretly
bound
her
yet
surely
she
had
never
met
him
before
despite
his
proletarian
exterior
his
assured
manner
breathed
an
air
of
gentlemanliness
and
the
way
he
constructed
the
menu
was
really
wonderful
the
steinbergerkabinett
which
looked
like
oil
when
he
poured
it
into
the
rhine
wine
glasses
suited
the
blue
trout
as
perfectly
as
if
it
were
its
native
element
and
the
next
course
the
sweetbread
patties
la
was
worthy
of
what
had
gone
before
neither
richard
nor
any
member
of
the
crew
was
so
skilled
in
the
epicurean
art
as
he
if
only
he
had
not
kept
tossing
off
one
glass
of
whiskey
after
the
other
my
brain
has
been
dulled
by
long
like
a
nail
hammered
on
he
said
in
i
must
whet
it
every
now
and
then
or
else
it
get
as
dull
as
the
edge
of
a
tombstone
when
the
roman
punch
was
served
a
brief
but
hot
discussion
arose
as
to
the
merits
of
certain
american
drinks
from
which
lilly
with
her
knowledge
of
the
whole
range
of
beverages
came
out
with
flying
colours
she
even
knew
accurately
the
ingredients
of
rennschmidt
favourite
mixture
the
south
sea
bowl
a
fiery
concoction
of
sherry
cognac
angostura
bitters
the
yolks
of
eggs
and
château
in
case
of
emergency
moselle
might
be
used
she
ventured
to
ask
might
she
not
prepare
the
rare
mixture
for
him
after
dinner
she
could
do
it
so
expertly
that
he
would
have
to
admit
he
had
not
drunk
anything
more
delicious
between
singapore
and
melbourne
konrad
who
had
evidently
never
suspected
her
talents
in
this
line
listened
to
her
with
an
astonishment
which
filled
her
with
pride
she
sent
him
one
furtive
look
after
another
which
asked
are
you
satisfied
am
i
pleasant
enough
to
him
but
he
failed
somehow
to
respond
he
remained
silent
and
abstracted
and
sometimes
he
seemed
to
be
remote
from
the
company
dream
on
she
thought
blissfully
will
look
out
for
our
happiness
the
friendship
between
her
and
the
old
man
waxed
apace
by
the
time
the
wild
duck
came
and
with
it
the
glowing
burgundy
which
slipped
down
their
throats
like
caressing
flames
she
had
already
been
calling
him
uncle
and
he
for
his
part
repeatedly
declared
that
he
was
totally
wrapped
up
in
his
dear
dear
little
lilly
so
this
was
the
test
the
cruel
test
from
which
she
had
thought
there
was
no
concealment
no
escape
the
test
that
would
bare
her
dissect
her
and
turn
her
soul
inside
out
she
could
scarcely
contain
herself
when
she
thought
of
it
yes
yes
there
sat
that
awful
danger
whose
moneybags
held
victory
or
defeat
a
little
monster
grown
tame
who
stroked
her
fingers
with
his
horrid
wrinkled
hands
and
fawned
on
her
for
a
crumb
of
her
favour
he
was
really
amusing
especially
when
he
told
jokes
what
a
lot
of
gossip
from
the
colonies
she
had
not
heard
so
many
anecdotes
in
a
whole
year
for
example
there
was
the
story
of
the
german
governor
mr
von
so
and
so
she
had
met
him
once
at
uhl
he
went
to
his
post
with
his
suite
consisting
of
his
secretary
his
valet
and
his
cook
six
months
afterwards
the
cook
went
to
him
and
said
governor
it
so
and
so
far
he
gave
her
two
thousand
marks
and
said
but
be
sure
and
hold
your
tongue
then
she
went
to
the
secretary
and
said
müller
so
and
so
far
he
gave
her
three
hundred
marks
and
said
but
be
sure
and
hold
your
tongue
then
she
went
to
the
valet
and
said
john
so
and
so
far
we
can
get
married
three
months
afterward
the
valet
went
to
the
governor
and
said
your
excellency
that
woman
did
us
all
the
brat
a
nigger
and
many
another
story
he
told
of
like
nature
she
had
to
hold
her
sides
with
laughter
laugh
konrad
darling
laugh
he
smiled
but
his
eyes
remained
serious
and
his
forehead
tense
when
the
champagne
was
brought
they
drank
fellowship
it
was
horrible
to
kiss
those
thick
greedy
old
lips
but
their
future
happiness
demanded
it
konrad
too
was
to
get
a
kiss
but
he
refused
it
worse
still
he
wanted
to
prohibit
her
drinking
she
is
careful
enough
he
muttered
please
uncle
do
give
her
so
much
we
have
never
drunk
so
much
but
they
both
laughed
at
him
he
always
been
a
country
yokel
the
old
man
teased
and
has
never
known
what
good
it
too
bad
for
you
to
throw
yourself
away
on
him
lilly
dear
you
ought
to
take
a
man
like
me
not
a
booby
in
corduroy
he
a
regular
funeral
torch
but
on
this
subject
lilly
brooked
no
teasing
you
let
my
little
konni
alone
you
old
fright
you
better
tell
your
old
chestnuts
come
along
forward
march
no
she
would
not
permit
a
word
against
her
sweet
little
konni
the
uncle
fell
to
telling
his
stories
again
now
they
were
anecdotes
in
that
lingo
which
the
chinese
and
other
interesting
personages
in
the
far
east
use
as
a
means
of
communication
with
the
white
sahibs
tom
and
paddy
in
the
tea
house
the
virtuous
miss
laura
in
macao
the
guide
and
the
bayadere
each
received
a
good
box
on
the
ear
but
konni
ought
not
to
hear
any
more
of
this
uncle
i
do
want
my
konni
to
be
spoiled
for
me
so
she
put
her
left
ear
close
to
the
old
gentleman
lips
and
made
a
whispering
cave
with
him
as
was
the
wont
of
members
of
the
crew
when
they
flirted
too
outrageously
or
misbehaved
in
other
ways
anyone
who
had
thought
she
was
or
unable
to
repay
like
with
like
would
have
been
sadly
mistaken
the
general
club
jokes
suffered
from
no
lack
of
juiciness
and
what
she
had
learned
from
the
crew
was
certainly
of
no
mean
parentage
it
was
worth
while
to
exert
an
extra
effort
for
so
appreciative
an
audience
as
uncle
but
konrad
the
innocent
had
to
submit
to
having
his
ears
stuffed
with
the
cotton
batting
upon
which
the
calville
apples
had
been
served
after
the
coffee
the
old
man
demanded
that
lilly
make
good
her
promise
and
prepare
the
south
sea
bowl
he
was
sure
her
assertion
had
been
a
mere
idle
boast
no
need
to
taunt
her
a
second
time
all
sorts
of
bottles
were
called
into
requisition
besides
the
sherry
and
the
angostura
an
old
sweet
yquem
it
was
really
a
pity
to
put
it
to
such
uses
so
rennschmidt
suggested
taking
a
glass
or
two
on
the
side
to
be
sure
the
eggs
broke
at
the
wrong
place
and
spilled
over
her
gown
and
the
carpet
but
that
made
no
difference
it
only
added
to
the
pleasure
at
any
rate
the
dear
old
uncle
was
paying
for
everything
to
compensate
the
flame
of
the
alcohol
lamp
leapt
in
the
air
all
the
more
wildly
up
to
the
orchids
up
to
the
sky
it
would
have
delighted
her
to
drink
in
the
tongues
of
fire
the
way
witches
do
your
luck
konni
luck
konni
do
drink
she
heard
his
voice
it
was
harsher
than
usual
and
strange
in
its
severity
country
yokel
she
laughed
thrusting
out
her
tongue
at
him
do
drink
the
voice
admonished
a
second
time
you
are
not
used
to
drinking
she
not
used
to
drinking
how
dared
he
say
such
a
thing
that
was
questioning
her
honour
yes
it
was
questioning
her
honour
how
do
you
know
what
i
used
to
i
used
to
quite
different
things
i
sat
on
this
very
seat
i
sitting
in
more
than
once
more
than
ten
times
and
have
drunk
much
much
more
dear
heart
think
of
what
you
saying
it
is
true
his
voice
once
more
sounded
soft
and
gentle
as
if
he
were
reproving
a
naughty
child
such
a
shame
it
was
enough
to
make
one
cry
how
can
you
say
it
is
not
true
do
you
think
i
a
liar
do
you
think
i
not
familiar
with
such
fashionable
places
as
this
pshaw
shall
i
prove
it
to
you
very
well
i
can
i
believe
you
find
my
name
on
the
base
of
this
lamp
lilly
czepanek
lilly
czepanek
just
look
for
it
look
for
it
he
started
to
his
feet
and
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
surface
defaced
by
a
jumble
of
characters
scratched
on
it
but
he
could
not
find
the
for
which
he
was
looking
she
had
to
come
to
his
assistance
not
not
there
the
letters
swam
before
her
eyes
she
had
to
try
to
catch
them
like
the
gold
fish
in
her
aquarium
aha
there
it
was
there
it
was
with
the
coronet
above
for
at
that
time
she
had
still
dared
to
use
the
prohibited
name
for
an
occasional
adornment
now
you
see
i
was
right
konni
now
you
will
let
me
drink
wo
you
here
to
you
you
sweet
little
yokel
he
was
so
struck
by
this
proof
that
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
said
not
a
word
but
the
uncle
and
she
continued
to
drink
and
laugh
at
him
when
she
threw
a
look
into
the
mirror
she
saw
as
through
a
billowy
haze
a
red
swollen
face
with
rumpled
hair
under
a
hat
tilted
back
on
the
head
and
two
deep
flabby
furrows
running
from
her
mouth
to
her
chin
this
caused
her
some
disquiet
but
she
had
no
time
to
heed
her
feeling
because
that
unspeakable
old
uncle
had
a
new
joke
on
the
carpet
do
you
know
lilly
dear
the
chinese
way
of
singing
the
lorelei
before
she
had
even
heard
a
syllable
she
burst
out
into
a
wild
laugh
he
put
one
of
his
bowed
legs
over
the
other
pretending
it
was
a
chinese
banjo
and
played
a
prelude
on
the
sole
of
his
foot
then
he
began
in
a
nasal
croaking
gurgling
voice
drawing
out
his
l
endlessly
o
my
belong
too
much
sorry
and
can
me
no
savy
what
kind
have
got
one
olo
piccy
story
no
wo
she
go
outside
my
mind
when
he
came
to
the
second
verse
dat
night
belang
dark
and
colo
he
tore
his
wig
from
his
head
to
heighten
the
effect
and
he
now
actually
looked
the
very
image
of
an
old
nodding
chinee
with
his
shiny
pate
and
his
bright
slanting
slits
of
eyes
it
was
a
fascinating
an
overpowering
spectacle
never
in
her
life
not
even
on
the
professional
stage
had
she
seen
a
clown
performance
so
provocative
of
laughter
she
would
have
died
of
envy
had
she
not
been
lilly
czepanek
the
famous
impersonator
who
when
the
spirit
moved
her
needed
but
to
open
her
mouth
to
evoke
a
storm
of
applause
her
matchless
repertoire
had
lain
fallow
too
long
but
the
beautiful
otéro
had
not
yet
grown
old
tortajada
still
set
your
senses
with
her
dancing
and
matchiche
had
just
come
into
fashion
lilly
merely
had
to
shove
her
hat
a
little
further
back
on
her
head
and
lift
her
black
dress
even
a
saharet
would
have
had
no
cause
to
be
ashamed
of
the
silk
petticoat
she
had
brought
in
her
trunk
and
then
off
she
could
go
and
off
she
went
like
a
whirlwind
over
the
carpet

with
the
yolks
of
eggs

chapter
xxi
it
was
nearly
noon
when
lilly
woke
in
a
glow
of
happiness
the
uncle
won
over
the
last
obstacle
removed
the
future
lying
before
her
a
land
of
blossoms
and
golden
fruits
what
a
farce
and
a
lark
the
dreaded
examination
had
been
what
a
what
a
buffoon
he
was
that
keen
penetrating
man
of
the
world
who
had
probably
ground
women
destinies
as
he
would
munch
betel
nuts
when
she
tried
to
review
the
events
of
the
evening
before
and
arrange
them
in
sequence
it
came
to
her
with
a
slight
sense
of
oppression
that
at
the
end
everything
had
resolved
itself
into
a
fog
shot
with
light
and
echoing
with
song
and
laughter
just
as
had
happened
yonder
in
that
other
life
when
she
had
romped
wildly
with
richard
and
the
crew
she
could
not
puzzle
out
how
she
had
mounted
the
steps
and
reached
her
room
as
the
fog
lifted
a
little
she
saw
peering
out
of
it
a
pale
set
face
with
an
expression
of
pained
surprise
she
heard
an
outcry
that
sounded
like
a
sob
or
a
groan
and
saw
herself
sobbing
next
to
someone
who
was
kneeling
who
pushed
her
away
with
his
hands
had
that
happened
had
she
dreamt
it
why
she
had
sung
and
danced
so
beautifully
she
had
disclosed
her
greatest
talents
could
they
by
any
possibility
have
displeased
him
had
she
gone
too
far
in
her
her
anxiety
waxed
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
dressed
herself
possessed
by
one
thought
to
go
to
him
at
twelve
the
rang
it
was
it
must
be
he
but
when
she
hurried
to
the
door
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
with
a
cry
of
relief
she
found
not
him
but
his
uncle
who
stood
twirling
his
hat
in
his
horrid
fingers
like
a
petitioner
and
looked
up
at
her
with
an
oily
wry
smile
most
obnoxious
to
her
is
the
examination
to
begin
again
the
question
rose
in
her
mind
or
is
it
just
going
to
begin
her
welcome
died
on
her
lips
without
speaking
she
let
him
in
she
experienced
a
sickish
sensation
of
vacancy
and
incorporeality
as
if
she
might
melt
through
the
wall
into
her
room
the
old
gentleman
did
not
wait
for
her
to
open
the
door
to
the
best
room
but
opened
it
himself
and
walked
in
as
if
he
were
an
old
acquaintance
where
is
konrad
konrad
with
his
little
finger
he
scratched
the
silk
band
of
his
wig
oh
thereby
hangs
a
tale
he
drew
out
his
watch
with
the
clinking
gold
chain
and
studied
the
dial
it
is
just
ten
minutes
after
twelve
i
suppose
by
now
he
on
his
way
to
the
station
yes
he
must
be
is
he
going
away
she
asked
her
breath
beginning
to
fail
yes
yes
he
going
to
take
a
trip
yes
last
night
hm
last
night
we
talked
it
over
so
now
he
going
to
take
a
little
trip
that
absurd
she
thought
how
can
he
go
away
without
me
but
she
checked
herself
and
entering
into
the
game
asked
with
apparent
nonchalance
where
he
off
to
so
suddenly
oh
just
a
little
trip
not
worth
talking
about
a
favourable
opening
presented
itself
there
happened
to
be
a
double
cabin
vacant
on
the
steamer
leaving
from
thingumbob
well
never
mind
from
where
outside
cabin
you
know
on
the
promenade
deck
the
best
situation
you
know
the
water
does
splash
in
and
there
plenty
of
air
and
what
you
always
want
especially
during
those
four
days
on
the
red
sea
then
it
was
true
her
suspicions
on
awakening
were
being
verified
more
swiftly
than
she
had
thought
they
would
be
it
was
only
the
beginning
of
the
test
of
her
character
and
intentions
what
do
people
do
in
the
red
sea
uncle
she
asked
with
her
most
innocent
smile
what
do
people
do
in
the
red
sea
child
four
thousand
years
ago
the
ancient
hebrews
probably
asked
the
same
question
and
everybody
still
asks
it
when
he
melts
into
perspiration
there
but
that
the
only
way
of
going
to
india
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
india
once
again
i
tired
of
trotting
about
on
red
brick
pavements
so
i
persuaded
him
to
come
along
for
a
little
while
you
know
he
overworked
you
admit
that
i
think
it
the
best
thing
to
do
in
such
cases
you
see
lilly
felt
a
lump
in
her
throat
as
if
all
the
gold
knobs
on
his
watch
chain
were
choking
her
rather
a
poor
joke
she
thought
but
goodness
knows
what
he
means
by
it
whether
she
would
or
no
she
had
to
keep
up
the
game
konrad
ought
to
have
been
polite
enough
to
come
and
say
she
replied
pouting
a
bit
as
if
he
were
about
to
start
off
on
a
trip
to
dresden
or
potsdam
why
he
wanted
to
child
of
course
he
did
but
i
said
to
him
see
my
boy
i
said
always
means
such
dreadful
excitement
enough
to
give
you
an
apoplectic
stroke
he
agreed
and
asked
me
to
arrange
matters
with
you
well
then
let
us
arrange
matters
she
answered
with
the
condescending
smile
that
the
farce
whatever
its
nature
merited
he
is
probably
down
below
in
a
cab
waiting
for
a
signal
she
thought
the
old
gentleman
put
his
stylish
panama
beside
him
on
the
floor
leaned
his
short
body
back
against
laue
plush
upholstery
and
tried
to
assume
an
expression
of
sympathy
and
grief
the
old
clown
if
it
were
my
affair
little
one
he
began
i
frankly
confess
gone
crazy
over
you
wrapped
up
as
i
said
yesterday
i
know
women
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
and
it
is
as
clear
as
cocoanut
oil
to
me
you
first
rate
stuff
you
fine
as
silk
but
there
are
people
who
take
themselves
seriously
and
have
great
illusions
do
you
know
people
utterly
without
an
idea
that
a
human
being
is
a
human
being
people
who
think
they
something
extra
and
want
life
to
dish
up
extra
to
them
oh
those
people
i
tell
you
those
people
that
the
way
the
great
disappointments
come
about
and
reproaches
and
despair
and
tearing
out
your
hair
he
came
near
giving
me
a
thrashing
last
night
whom
are
you
talking
about
lilly
asked
growing
more
and
more
fearful
as
if
i
had
led
you
into
overshooting
the
mark
no
indeed
nothing
of
the
sort
i
do
do
such
things
i
do
set
and
i
told
him
so
ten
times
over
but
the
misfortune
is
we
understood
each
other
too
well
we
both
belong
to
the
same
business
we
like
two
old
shipmates
what
do
you
mean
by
both
you
and
i
lilly
asked
with
frigid
astonishment
in
her
tone
yes
you
and
i
my
child
do
fall
overboard
you
and
i
to
be
sure
you
a
splendid
beauty
of
and
i
an
old
fool
of
sixty
but
you
and
i
have
gone
through
the
same
mill
what
need
to
explain
to
you
at
length
have
you
ever
searched
for
diamonds
i
do
mean
at
a
jeweller
that
you
probably
have
well
a
diamond
lies
in
hard
rock
in
funnels
in
blue
ground
if
you
come
upon
a
blue
ground
funnel
you
can
imagine
what
it
like
there
you
squat
i
went
digging
for
diamonds
once
with
twenty
men
day
and
night
for
weeks
and
weeks
the
blue
ground
was
there
oh
indeed
it
was
but
the
diamonds
had
been
washed
away
do
you
see
what
i
driving
at
the
fine
ground
is
still
in
both
of
us
but
what
actually
makes
it
fine
the
devil
has
already
extracted
why
are
you
saying
all
this
to
me
lilly
asked
tears
were
rising
to
her
eyes
from
sheer
perplexity
because
what
he
said
could
not
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
the
great
test
i
tell
you
little
girl
there
are
people
who
think
there
no
going
back
on
their
word
they
have
to
swallow
whatever
they
once
put
into
their
mouths
they
wo
spit
it
out
even
if
it
is
a
strychnine
pill
now
on
the
other
hand
think
that
nobody
need
consciously
plunge
into
misfortune
neither
you
nor
he
and
since
it
best
to
wash
the
wool
directly
on
the
sheep
body
i
came
to
you
to
make
a
little
proposition
you
see
here
a
check
book
you
familiar
with
check
books
i
sure
on
the
right
side
are
printed
ciphers
from
five
hundred
up
to
you
can
see
for
yourself
all
the
ciphers
that
make
the
amount
higher
than
the
sum
written
on
the
check
are
cut
off
to
keep
little
swindlers
from
cheating
a
man
out
of
a
hundred
thousand
marks
with
one
stroke
of
the
pen
now
look
this
check
is
dated
and
signed
all
missing
is
the
sum
because
i
should
never
permit
myself
to
offer
you
a
certain
amount
i
leave
it
to
you
to
specify
what
you
think
you
need
for
a
decent
living
in
the
future
he
tore
a
check
from
the
book
and
laid
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
thank
heaven
thought
lilly
all
my
tremours
were
needless
it
was
a
clumsy
trap
even
a
blind
man
must
see
that
his
procedure
was
nothing
more
than
a
test
of
her
disinterestedness
so
instead
of
throwing
the
old
man
out
of
doors
which
she
should
have
and
would
have
done
had
he
proffered
the
check
in
all
seriousness
she
smiled
and
took
the
check
from
the
table
and
methodically
tore
it
into
bits
and
with
the
middle
finger
of
her
right
hand
flicked
one
little
pile
of
them
after
the
other
into
his
face
he
jerked
about
uneasily
in
his
chair
permit
me
he
said
permit
me
by
no
means
i
will
permit
such
vile
jokes
uncle
but
you
are
rejecting
a
fortune
child
consider
we
torn
you
from
your
moorings
we
thrown
you
as
it
were
on
the
street
upon
us
rests
the
responsibility
of
seeing
to
it
that
you
are
not
driven
to
ruin
and
if
you
think
that
by
accepting
the
check
you
are
lowering
yourself
in
konrad
eyes
i
can
swear
to
you
he
does
know
a
thing
about
it
and
he
never
will
i
swear
to
that
also
she
merely
smiled
his
little
blinking
eyes
turned
bright
and
staring
suddenly
there
was
a
cold
threat
in
their
look
or
perhaps
you
intend
to
hold
the
boy
to
his
promise
and
mean
to
twist
his
pledge
into
a
halter
about
his
neck
is
that
the
sort
you
are
eh
no
i
not
that
sort
her
smile
flitted
past
him
and
went
to
meet
her
beloved
who
must
soon
very
soon
come
storming
up
the
stairs
surely
he
could
not
endure
waiting
down
there
in
the
cab
so
long
his
word
is
in
his
own
keeping
he
never
gave
me
a
pledge
even
if
he
wanted
to
i
should
never
have
accepted
it
and
even
if
what
you
said
is
true
he
could
go
on
his
trip
quite
calmly
and
return
quite
calmly
i
would
never
attempt
to
meet
him
or
reach
him
by
letter
or
remind
him
of
what
he
is
to
me
and
will
continue
to
be
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
know
it
is
true
he
loves
me
and
i
love
him
and
take
care
uncle
not
to
play
such
low
tricks
with
his
future
wife
as
to
offer
blank
checks
and
the
like
if
i
were
to
tell
him
about
it
you
all
of
a
sudden
find
you
a
lonely
old
man
who
can
leave
his
money
to
a
cat
and
dog
asylum
now
he
must
see
what
a
blunder
he
had
committed
his
mistake
annoyed
him
so
that
he
jumped
from
his
seat
with
a
muttered
pshaw
and
tramped
about
the
room
playing
with
his
watch
charm
and
murmuring
two
or
three
times
something
like
a
hangman
job
but
she
probably
misunderstood
him
finally
he
seemed
to
have
reached
a
decision
he
stopped
close
to
her
laid
his
disgusting
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
said
listen
my
dear
sweet
little
girl
we
ca
part
without
arriving
at
a
conclusion
if
i
were
such
a
cursed
mangy
old
and
if
over
and
above
this
i
did
have
to
be
considerate
of
the
boy
feelings
the
matter
would
be
perfectly
simple
i
should
say
one
if
you
want
to
come
let
go
to
the
nearest
magistrate
but
hurry
i
much
time
to
lose
do
stare
at
me
so
yes
that
what
i
mean
with
with
me
you
would
need
to
regret
it
either
as
for
konrad
see
here
you
must
really
say
so
to
yourself
it
wo
do
we
should
hit
it
off
it
would
be
harnessing
before
and
aft
because
he
is
a
rising
man
he
wants
to
climb
to
the
top
he
is
still
blessed
with
faith
and
you
no
longer
possess
it
too
early
in
life
you
tumbled
into
the
great
machine
which
finally
converts
us
all
into
complacent
wormy
mush
you
yourself
would
feel
happy
you
would
be
able
to
keep
pace
you
would
lie
on
him
a
lifeless
cargo
and
be
conscious
of
it
too
i
not
laying
so
much
stress
on
last
night
not
the
appearance
of
a
coast
line
that
counts
it
does
matter
whether
it
covered
with
palms
or
sand
the
important
thing
is
the
interior
and
in
the
interior
i
see
steppes
scorched
no
birds
flying
across
it
a
desert
where
confidence
will
not
strike
root
crawl
into
whatever
shelter
life
offers
you
little
one
cling
to
those
who
brought
you
to
the
pass
you
are
in
but
let
the
boy
go
he
not
meant
for
you
be
frank
did
you
say
so
to
yourself
long
ago
so
that
what
it
was
no
test
the
end
the
end
lilly
stared
into
space
she
seemed
to
hear
a
tread
dying
away
a
step
lower
another
step
another
step
and
another
growing
fainter
ever
fainter
as
when
konrad
had
slipped
away
from
her
at
dawn
but
this
time
they
would
never
return
she
felt
a
slight
gnawing
disenchantment
creep
about
her
heart
nothing
more
the
worst
would
come
later
she
knew
from
of
old
then
she
saw
herself
dancing
and
yodeling
and
telling
hoggish
jokes
with
her
hat
tilted
to
one
side
and
her
petticoats
raised
to
her
knees
a
drunken
wench
she
of
the
lofty
spirit
and
head
divine
a
drunken
wench
not
a
whit
better
now
she
knew
why
he
had
stood
there
white
as
chalk
why
that
sob
of
distress
had
burst
from
his
lips
and
the
feeling
that
poured
over
her
in
that
second
like
a
stream
of
boiling
water
was
compounded
as
much
of
pity
for
konrad
as
of
shame
of
herself
how
does
he
bear
it
she
faltered
you
can
imagine
how
he
replied
but
i
think
i
can
pull
him
through
it
uncle
i
did
to
she
cried
with
a
great
sob
i
know
child
i
know
he
told
me
everything
for
an
instant
wounded
pride
flared
up
within
her
she
stopped
picked
up
a
few
of
the
scattered
bits
of
paper
and
held
them
out
to
him
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
you
dared
to
offer
me
this
why
what
was
i
to
do
child
and
what
i
do
with
you
bah
she
struck
at
him
with
both
hands
but
the
next
instant
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
wept
on
his
shoulder
that
was
the
place
perhaps
on
which
konrad
tearful
face
had
also
rested
the
night
before
rennschmidt
began
to
speak
again
he
made
various
proposals
for
her
future
he
would
help
her
begin
a
new
life
would
give
her
the
means
for
cultivating
her
great
talent
for
the
stage
but
she
shook
her
head
at
each
of
his
suggestions
too
late
uncle
you
yourself
said
where
confidence
will
not
strike
root
i
might
aspire
to
fame
but
to
be
quite
frank
that
would
pay
me
the
damned
curs
he
hissed
what
curs
you
know
she
reflected
as
to
whom
he
could
possibly
mean
there
was
really
only
one
she
observed
oh
yes
and
another
and
then
one
more
and
later
there
were
two
besides
but
they
do
count
it
seems
to
me
that
quite
enough
little
girl
he
stroked
her
cheeks
smiling
kindly
and
she
did
not
find
his
fingers
so
disgusting
she
even
had
to
smile
in
response
though
she
fell
directly
to
crying
again
rennschmidt
prepared
to
take
leave
she
clung
to
his
shoulder
she
did
not
want
to
let
him
go
he
was
the
last
bridge
that
joined
her
departing
vessel
with
the
land
of
happiness
what
message
shall
i
take
to
him
he
asked
she
drew
herself
up
her
eyes
widened
she
wanted
to
pour
out
all
her
grief
her
squandered
love
sought
for
words
which
would
carry
it
to
him
purged
and
sanctified
but
she
found
none
she
looked
about
the
room
as
if
help
must
come
from
some
quarter
the
pictures
of
the
ancient
actors
smiled
upon
her
those
who
had
once
been
so
eloquent
had
become
dumb
dumb
as
her
own
soul
the
framed
lamp
shade
greeted
her
as
if
the
future
she
had
to
pass
at
laue
side
was
greeting
her
i
do
know
what
to
say
she
faltered
then
something
occurred
to
her
after
all
please
ask
him
please
ask
him
why
he
himself
did
come
to
say
i
know
him
he
is
not
a
coward
rennschmidt
made
his
queerest
face
since
you
so
remarkably
sensible
child
i
tell
you
of
he
wanted
to
come
and
say
i
even
told
him
i
try
to
drag
you
to
the
station
without
an
instant
reflection
she
made
a
dash
for
her
hat
stop
he
had
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
the
little
fat
figure
grew
taller
you
will
go
what
konni
is
waiting
for
me
konni
wants
to
speak
to
me
and
i
am
to
go
you
not
i
tell
you
if
you
the
brave
girl
i
took
you
to
be
you
will
not
nullify
the
sacrifice
you
making
you
can
reckon
upon
it
if
he
sees
you
again
you
both
remain
hanging
on
each
other
her
hat
slipped
from
her
hand
then
tell
him
i
love
him
forever
forever
he
be
my
last
thought
on
earth
and
and
i
do
know
what
else
to
say
he
left
the
room
without
a
word
then
she
collapsed
chapter
xxii
the
world
went
its
way
calmly
gaily
busily
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
as
if
no
lost
happiness
were
tossing
about
on
the
sea
of
life
disappearing
farther
and
farther
in
the
distance
as
if
no
human
being
had
been
thrown
into
a
corner
to
crouch
there
and
stare
at
the
ground
helplessly
with
dimmed
eyes
laue
was
pasting
pressed
flowers
the
fried
potatoes
were
sizzling
in
fat
the
lamp
in
the
hall
was
smoking
and
the
poor
people
odour
greeted
all
who
entered
its
realm
lilly
did
not
cry
her
heart
out
of
her
body
as
when
she
had
been
expelled
from
lischnitz
she
did
not
sink
into
a
state
of
apathetic
brooding
nor
wrestle
desperately
with
fate
all
she
felt
was
a
dim
void
stretching
endlessly
before
her
broken
now
and
again
by
a
sharp
outcry
like
that
of
an
animal
bereft
of
its
mate
a
sense
of
acquiescence
a
consciousness
of
inevitable
imprisonment
of
a
fearful
descent
into
dark
depths
of
a
dismal
death
lacking
strength
and
dignity
between
the
present
and
the
future
the
sort
of
future
that
beckoned
to
her
from
every
street
rose
the
railing
of
the
bridge
she
had
tried
to
climb
after
seeing
rosmersholm
and
when
she
stared
into
space
with
tearless
eyes
she
saw
far
below
the
black
water
rolling
idly
along
and
heard
the
iron
rail
clink
under
her
sole
this
clinking
became
stronger
and
turned
into
an
accompaniment
of
everything
that
came
and
went
during
the
uneventful
days
it
drilled
her
brain
hammered
at
her
temples
and
tingled
in
every
pore
of
her
body
there
was
a
text
to
the
miserable
melody
the
text
was
to
die
well
then
to
die
what
could
be
simpler
and
what
more
compelling
but
not
perchance
or
day
after
something
might
still
happen
a
letter
might
arrive
or
even
he
himself
or
if
neither
of
these
contingencies
came
to
pass
who
could
tell
what
miracle
fate
held
in
readiness
for
the
morrow
to
let
hour
after
hour
of
one
additional
day
pass
in
the
same
melancholy
monotony
one
evening
a
week
after
konrad
sudden
departure
it
happened
that
laue
entered
the
best
room
at
an
unusual
time
with
an
emphatic
manner
and
said
now
lilly
dear
you
can
not
go
on
the
same
way
if
you
were
to
cry
i
should
say
anything
but
way
you
never
come
back
to
reason
there
only
one
sane
and
natural
thing
for
you
to
do
return
to
your
dehnicke
if
he
had
an
inkling
of
how
things
are
with
you
he
would
have
come
to
fetch
you
long
ago
so
you
either
sit
right
down
and
write
him
a
nice
letter
or
morning
i
give
up
my
work
and
go
to
see
him
in
his
office
i
get
my
expenses
back
lilly
felt
violently
impelled
to
drive
the
old
woman
out
of
the
room
but
she
had
grown
too
discouraged
to
do
more
than
turn
away
in
impotent
repugnance
i
have
much
time
i
must
say
continued
laue
i
have
to
complete
the
dozen
before
going
to
bed
but
you
can
make
up
your
mind
to
one
thing
if
he
not
here
by
ten
morning
come
at
twelve
at
the
very
latest
because
by
that
time
i
myself
will
have
gone
for
him
lilly
laughed
sadly
in
scorn
so
that
was
the
way
the
miracle
looked
which
fate
held
in
readiness
for
the
morrow
should
she
submit
all
over
again
to
a
man
puny
supremacy
crawl
back
into
the
cowardly
comfort
of
perfumed
imprisonment
vegetate
among
inane
festivities
in
a
sort
of
doze
or
walk
the
streets
when
driven
by
disgust
and
boredom
she
would
not
have
the
force
to
resist
the
next
day
when
he
came
she
knew
it
well
richard
needed
merely
to
look
at
her
once
with
that
expression
which
was
entirely
new
to
her
in
him
the
very
thought
of
it
filled
her
with
humiliating
softness
something
was
already
stirring
within
her
that
would
compel
her
to
throw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
cry
on
his
shoulder
it
was
really
not
worth
while
to
bide
the
morrow
for
so
pitiful
a
reward
so
she
would
die
that
very
day
that
very
day
it
came
to
her
like
a
cup
of
intoxication
with
clasped
hands
she
ran
about
the
room
weeping
rejoicing
she
would
be
a
heroine
like
isolde
a
martyr
to
her
love
and
the
railing
of
the
bridge
was
waiting
how
it
would
quiver
and
hum
when
she
climbed
on
it
then
the
buzzing
in
her
head
grew
louder
the
air
was
filled
with
a
medley
of
tones
the
walls
with
the
refrain
the
noise
on
the
streets
the
mighty
roar
of
the
city
everything
sang
die
die
die
she
tore
off
her
gown
and
dressed
to
go
out
at
first
she
thought
of
wearing
one
of
her
two
dresses
because
they
had
come
from
konrad
but
she
could
not
prevail
upon
herself
to
do
so
die
in
beauty
hedda
gabler
had
said
oh
if
only
i
had
his
picture
thought
lilly
so
that
i
could
take
one
last
look
at
his
eyes
but
all
she
had
from
him
were
his
letters
and
a
few
poems
they
were
to
accompany
her
on
her
last
walk
they
were
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
leather
trunk
which
was
still
hidden
in
laue
hole
of
a
room
although
the
need
for
concealment
was
past
when
she
rummaged
for
the
little
packages
among
the
contents
of
the
trunk
she
came
by
chance
upon
the
old
score
of
the
song
of
songs
she
tenderly
regarded
the
yellow
stained
roll
she
was
no
longer
angry
with
her
song
of
songs
or
scorned
it
as
she
had
on
that
unfortunate
morning
when
she
had
gone
to
her
former
home
to
break
her
promise
to
konrad
once
again
it
became
a
dear
valuable
possession
though
neither
a
monitor
nor
worker
of
miracles
nor
a
sanctuary
it
still
was
an
old
remnant
but
one
to
be
kissed
and
petted
and
cried
over
because
a
part
of
her
own
life
clung
to
it
and
some
of
her
blood
also
there
were
the
dark
stains
on
the
day
of
her
going
forth
they
had
fallen
upon
it
and
on
the
day
of
her
coming
home
the
deep
waters
would
wash
them
away
then
her
mind
glided
past
the
score
back
into
the
hazy
past
mists
seemed
to
be
lifting
and
curtains
to
be
drawn
aside
and
her
way
seemed
to
lie
behind
her
like
a
sharply
defined
band
she
had
been
weak
and
stupid
and
had
never
considered
her
own
interests
every
man
that
had
entered
her
life
had
done
with
her
what
he
would
she
had
never
closed
the
doors
of
her
soul
never
shown
her
teeth
never
given
free
play
to
the
power
of
her
beauty
but
had
always
been
ready
to
serve
others
to
love
them
and
make
the
best
of
everything
as
thanks
she
had
been
persecuted
and
beaten
and
dragged
in
the
mud
her
life
long
even
the
one
man
who
had
esteemed
her
had
gone
away
without
saying
but
she
thought
i
have
never
hated
a
single
one
of
them
and
i
have
always
had
the
right
to
regard
myself
as
above
the
common
however
i
have
suffered
however
i
have
sinned
and
the
end
was
a
gift
did
it
not
seem
as
if
this
song
of
songs
which
lay
there
debased
stained
decayed
like
her
own
life
had
in
truth
hovered
over
her
blessing
her
and
granting
her
absolution
from
her
sins
just
as
in
her
early
dreams
and
just
as
in
her
rhapsodies
to
konrad
during
that
hour
of
blissful
yes
you
shall
come
along
she
said
you
shall
die
when
i
die
she
carefully
rolled
and
wrapped
up
the
crumbling
sheets
then
she
found
the
letters
in
the
trunk
read
them
once
and
several
times
again
but
she
did
not
understand
what
she
was
reading
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
she
softly
closed
the
tall
door
behind
her
laue
was
still
asleep
nobody
met
her
on
the
stairs
and
she
managed
to
leave
the
house
without
being
seen
since
her
flight
to
konrad
she
had
not
been
alone
on
the
street
at
midnight
the
two
long
rows
of
house
fronts
dipped
in
garish
light
the
trolley
poles
sparking
and
flashing
between
silent
shadowy
figures
it
was
all
as
if
she
were
looking
upon
it
for
the
first
time
an
oppressive
fear
beset
her
her
legs
felt
numb
as
if
wooden
stilts
had
been
screwed
to
them
upon
which
she
must
hasten
on
without
hesitating
or
stopping
whether
she
would
or
no
and
her
heels
rapped
on
the
pavement
carrying
her
on
irresistibly
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
goal
at
the
approach
of
each
passerby
she
was
impelled
to
hide
herself
in
the
belief
that
her
appearance
betrayed
her
intentions
so
she
chose
dark
side
streets
which
were
being
paved
and
where
withering
linden
trees
scattered
rain
drops
her
way
led
past
long
rows
of
brick
buildings
inhospitably
set
behind
dark
garden
walls
past
barns
and
factories
and
her
heels
kept
rapping
tap
tap
tap
as
if
she
were
wearing
a
pedometer
which
accurately
registered
every
inch
shortening
her
course
she
began
to
think
of
roundabout
ways
of
reaching
her
bridge
but
she
cast
the
temptation
from
her
if
it
were
done
well
it
were
done
quickly
she
had
read
somewhere
forward
with
clenched
teeth
the
engelbecken
lay
dark
and
deserted
yellow
lights
glinted
on
the
invisible
waters
it
would
be
easier
here
she
thought
breathless
from
the
oppression
at
her
heart
and
stepped
nearer
on
the
grassy
slope
but
she
recoiled
with
a
shudder
it
had
to
be
the
bridge
on
the
northwest
side
fate
had
willed
it
so
it
was
still
a
great
distance
off
about
an
hour
walk
she
came
to
livelier
streets
the
lamps
in
front
of
the
dance
halls
where
fallen
women
revelled
sent
their
garish
beams
out
into
the
night
like
tentacles
on
on
she
must
go
from
the
open
doors
of
a
basement
café
was
wafted
a
hot
vapour
what
smelled
like
that
oh
yes
the
little
sausages
redlich
had
given
her
son
as
a
farewell
dinner
directly
in
front
of
her
a
hose
as
thick
as
her
arm
spurted
a
cleansing
stream
over
the
pavement
what
had
she
heard
hiss
and
gurgle
along
the
ground
like
that
oh
yes
it
had
sounded
just
like
that
when
old
haberland
had
watered
the
lawn
with
the
copper
sprinkler
suddenly
the
idea
shot
through
her
brain
none
of
this
is
true
i
am
lying
in
bed
between
the
bookcases
of
the
circulating
library
and
the
lamp
i
took
from
the
bracket
is
smoking
back
of
me
and
it
is
all
in
the
book
i
am
reading
on
the
sly
after
asmussen
dose
of
medicine
has
happily
worked
the
city
noises
swelled
and
called
her
back
to
life
she
had
reached
the
heart
of
the
city
the
vortex
of
berlin
unwearying
night
life
she
passed
the
spittelmarkt
leipziger
strasse
unrolled
before
her
a
stupendous
scene
with
its
endless
chain
of
street
lamps
a
silvery
mist
enveloped
it
or
rather
it
resembled
a
gay
picture
lightly
covered
by
a
layer
of
mould
dotted
with
the
lights
of
cafés
and
cabarets
glimmering
red
the
numb
feeling
in
lilly
legs
increased
she
moved
them
without
realising
that
she
was
moving
them
she
felt
nothing
but
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
which
shook
her
whole
body
like
the
vibrations
of
a
mill
on
friedrichstrasse
the
people
thronged
as
in
the
daytime
young
men
rejoicing
in
the
chase
followed
close
upon
the
heels
of
their
laughing
quarry
the
lamplight
shone
on
the
silk
stockings
of
damsels
as
they
tripped
along
those
who
have
once
been
completely
submerged
in
this
world
thought
lilly
with
a
shudder
of
envy
no
longer
trouble
themselves
with
questions
of
honour
and
death
alas
beyond
that
brilliant
whirl
came
quiet
and
darkness
again
in
whose
shelter
a
person
may
die
as
he
will
and
her
heels
kept
beating
tap
tap
tap
she
could
hear
them
even
in
all
that
noise
could
i
go
to
some
café
she
asked
herself
what
harm
if
some
one
were
to
see
me
i
should
gain
a
paltry
quarter
of
an
hour
lights
mirrors
upholstery
curling
blue
cigarette
smoke
a
tingling
in
her
parched
throat
once
once
again
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
hour
and
still
longer
if
she
wished
it
a
poor
bit
of
life
which
would
do
nobody
any
harm
but
she
could
find
no
justification
for
such
cowardice
and
she
did
not
want
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
at
the
very
last
so
on
on
the
laughing
crowds
of
the
kranzlerecke
fell
behind
the
lights
no
longer
pricked
her
lilly
scarcely
knew
where
she
was
going
she
had
probably
reached
one
of
the
quieter
cross
streets
that
lead
to
the
northwest
side
the
middle
of
the
empty
street
was
dotted
with
glistening
puddles
the
pluvial
autumn
wind
came
sweeping
along
between
the
rows
of
houses
the
dark
windows
coldly
reflected
the
light
of
the
street
lamps
everything
about
her
seemed
lifeless
extinct
only
at
rare
intervals
a
phantom
glided
by
and
the
cats
sped
from
hiding
place
to
hiding
place
shivering
lilly
pressed
the
score
closer
under
her
arm
she
passed
a
florist
shop
where
the
blinds
of
the
show
window
had
not
been
drawn
glancing
at
her
reflection
she
was
startled
to
see
the
prickly
foliage
of
laurels
and
cypresses
what
had
gleamed
like
that
oh
yes
the
clytie
that
dreamily
smiled
down
from
the
proud
staircase
of
the
house
of
liebert
dehnicke
now
lilly
czepanek
would
never
mount
those
stairs
in
triumph
nor
even
crawl
to
look
upon
them
a
repentant
sinner
she
reached
a
bridge
she
crossed
it
quickly
that
other
bridge
luring
her
on
lay
in
remoter
solitude
in
darker
silence
you
have
too
much
love
in
you
some
one
had
once
said
all
three
kinds
love
of
the
heart
love
of
the
senses
love
springing
from
pity
one
of
them
everybody
must
have
two
are
dangerous
all
three
lead
to
ruin
who
had
that
been
oh
yes
her
first
flame
the
poor
consumptive
teacher
who
had
lectured
to
the
selecta
on
the
history
of
art
and
whom
she
and
rosalie
katz
had
helped
to
send
to
the
promised
land
the
land
she
herself
had
never
entered
he
had
spoken
of
blue
olive
vapours
the
sea
blackened
by
the
breath
of
the
sirocco
and
shining
meadows
of
asphodel
what
kind
of
meadows
could
they
be
meadows
of
asphodel
how
fantastic
the
foreign
word
sounded
and
how
full
of
promise
but
her
heels
said
tap
tap
tap
and
the
railing
of
the
bridge
called
to
her
a
man
spoke
to
her
would
she
she
shook
him
off
like
a
worm
she
had
been
given
another
warning
also
with
three
parts
to
it
by
whom
oh
yes
pieper
she
suddenly
heard
the
sententious
admonition
in
his
very
words
and
tone
of
voice
as
if
he
had
uttered
it
the
day
before
first
exchange
no
superfluous
glances
second
demand
no
superfluous
rendering
of
accounts
third
make
no
superfluous
confessions
if
i
had
not
exchanged
superfluous
glances
i
should
have
seen
my
promised
land
if
i
had
not
superfluously
demanded
the
rendering
of
an
account
i
should
never
have
been
expelled
from
lischnitz
and
if
i
had
not
made
superfluous
confessions
what
then
konni
konni
she
moaned
her
yearning
welled
up
hot
and
painful
and
forced
her
revolving
thoughts
from
her
mind
she
walked
on
reeling
more
streets
disappeared
in
the
fog
interrupted
at
one
place
by
a
grass
plot
with
a
hedge
about
it
what
sort
of
meadows
could
they
be
meadows
of
asphodel
suddenly
she
stood
at
the
bridge
like
a
thief
in
the
night
it
loomed
up
in
the
darkness
of
the
wide
silent
place
where
the
lights
of
thousands
of
street
lamps
dwindled
into
tiny
sparks
a
full
moon
shone
somewhere
in
the
black
sky
it
was
the
illuminated
clock
of
a
railway
station
the
body
of
which
was
swallowed
by
the
darkness
one
lilly
saw
everything
as
through
a
spotted
veil
she
was
going
to
turn
the
corner
of
the
wall
instead
paralysed
by
horror
she
sank
down
against
it
her
heart
throbbing
powerfully
after
all
i
am
not
going
to
do
it
she
said
to
herself
yet
i
will
she
answered
she
tried
to
go
on
straight
ahead
on
the
bridge
where
the
rail
awaited
her
maliciously
but
her
legs
refused
to
carry
her
the
singing
in
her
ears
rose
to
a
roar
she
stood
on
the
dark
solitary
bank
wavering
she
took
the
score
in
both
hands
tore
at
it
and
tried
to
crumple
it
into
a
ball
but
it
did
not
give
way
her
song
of
songs
was
stronger
than
she
suddenly
her
feet
moved
of
themselves
and
carried
her
on
on
whether
she
willed
it
or
not
past
the
lamps
at
the
entrance
to
the
rail
awaiting
her
now
her
fingers
grasped
the
iron
top
of
the
railing
all
she
could
see
of
the
water
below
was
a
dark
slimy
shimmer
not
even
the
lamps
were
reflected
in
it
now
one
leap
and
the
thing
was
done
yes
i
do
it
i
do
it
a
voice
within
her
called
but
she
had
to
send
the
song
of
songs
ahead
it
would
be
a
hindrance
to
her
as
she
climbed
over
she
threw
it
a
bit
of
white
flitted
by
a
splash
below
sharp
and
distinct
which
made
her
tingle
all
over
like
a
slap
in
the
face
when
she
heard
the
sound
she
knew
she
would
never
do
it
no
lilly
czepanek
was
not
a
heroine
she
was
not
martyr
to
her
love
she
was
no
isolde
who
finds
the
strongest
affirmation
of
herself
in
the
desire
not
to
be
she
was
nothing
but
a
poor
thing
who
had
been
crushed
and
exploited
and
would
drag
along
through
life
as
best
she
could
at
the
same
time
she
began
to
array
all
the
possibilities
of
a
livelihood
remaining
open
to
her
she
would
return
to
the
old
life
of
dissipation
that
was
certain
no
matter
how
much
richard
look
might
plead
and
beg
anything
else
would
do
to
be
sure
she
had
been
completely
robbed
of
her
desire
to
work
and
it
seemed
very
doubtful
whether
it
would
ever
come
back
to
her
again
but
after
all
something
would
present
itself
which
would
enable
her
to
live
in
peace
and
virtue
millions
of
human
beings
ask
for
nothing
better
and
call
it
happiness
she
sent
one
more
searching
look
at
the
lazy
waters
in
which
the
song
of
songs
had
just
disappeared
then
she
turned
and
went
back
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
the
business
world
of
berlin
was
surprised
to
read
in
the
papers
that
richard
dehnicke
senior
member
of
the
old
firm
of
liebert
dehnicke
manufacturers
of
art
bronzes
had
married
the
beauty
lilly
czepanek
and
had
gone
to
italy
to
live
there
temporarily
those
who
knew
her
were
not
surprised
she
had
always
been
a
dangerous
woman
they
said
