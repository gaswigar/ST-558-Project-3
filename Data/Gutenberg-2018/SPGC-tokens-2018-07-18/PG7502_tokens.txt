author
of

april
hopes
etc
i
after
the
death
of
judge
kilburn
his
daughter
came
back
to
america
they
had
been
eleven
winters
in
rome
always
meaning
to
return
but
staying
on
from
year
to
year
as
people
do
who
have
nothing
definite
to
call
them
home
toward
the
last
miss
kilburn
tacitly
gave
up
the
expectation
of
getting
her
father
away
though
they
both
continued
to
say
that
they
were
going
to
take
passage
as
soon
as
the
weather
was
settled
in
the
spring
at
the
date
they
had
talked
of
for
sailing
he
was
lying
in
the
protestant
cemetery
and
she
was
trying
to
gather
herself
together
and
adjust
her
life
to
his
loss
this
would
have
been
easier
with
a
younger
person
for
she
had
been
her
father
pet
so
long
and
then
had
taken
care
of
his
helplessness
with
a
devotion
which
was
finally
so
motherly
that
it
was
like
losing
at
once
a
parent
and
a
child
when
he
died
and
she
remained
with
the
habit
of
giving
herself
when
there
was
no
longer
any
one
to
receive
the
sacrifice
he
had
married
late
and
in
her
year
he
was
but
the
disparity
of
their
ages
increasing
toward
the
end
through
his
infirmities
had
not
loosened
for
her
the
ties
of
custom
and
affection
that
bound
them
she
had
seen
him
grow
more
and
more
fitfully
cognisant
of
what
they
had
been
to
each
other
since
her
mother
death
while
she
grew
the
more
tender
and
fond
with
him
people
who
came
to
condole
with
her
seemed
not
to
understand
this
or
else
they
thought
it
would
help
her
to
bear
up
if
they
treated
her
bereavement
as
a
relief
from
hopeless
anxiety
they
were
all
surprised
when
she
told
them
she
still
meant
to
go
home
why
my
dear
said
one
old
lady
who
had
been
away
from
america
twenty
years
is
home
you
lived
in
this
apartment
longer
now
than
the
oldest
inhabitant
has
lived
in
most
american
towns
what
are
you
talking
about
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
back
to
washington
oh
no
we
were
merely
staying
on
in
washington
from
force
of
habit
after
father
gave
up
practice
i
think
we
shall
go
back
to
the
old
homestead
where
we
used
to
spend
our
summers
ever
since
i
can
and
where
is
that
the
old
lady
asked
with
the
sharpness
which
people
believe
must
somehow
be
good
for
a
broken
spirit
it
in
the
interior
of
massachusetts
you
would
know
it
a
place
called
no
i
certainly
should
said
the
old
lady
with
superiority
why
hatboro
of
all
the
ridiculous
reasons
it
was
one
of
the
first
places
where
they
began
to
make
straw
hats
it
was
a
nickname
at
first
and
then
they
adopted
it
the
old
name
was
dorchester
farms
father
fought
the
change
but
it
was
of
no
use
the
people
have
it
farms
after
the
place
began
to
grow
and
by
that
time
they
had
got
used
to
hatboro
besides
i
do
see
how
it
any
worse
than
hatfield
in
it
very
oh
it
american
we
have
boxboro
too
you
know
in
and
you
are
going
from
rome
to
hatboro
said
the
old
lady
trying
to
present
the
idea
in
the
strongest
light
by
abbreviating
the
name
of
the
state
yes
said
miss
kilburn
it
will
be
a
change
but
not
so
much
of
a
change
as
you
would
think
it
was
father
wish
to
go
ah
my
cried
the
old
lady
you
letting
that
weigh
with
you
i
see
do
do
it
if
it
was
wise
do
you
suppose
that
the
last
thing
he
could
wish
you
to
do
would
be
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
a
sick
whim
of
his
the
kindness
expressed
in
the
words
touched
annie
kilburn
she
had
a
certain
beauty
of
feature
she
was
but
her
eyes
were
brown
and
soft
her
lips
red
and
full
her
dark
hair
grew
low
and
played
in
little
wisps
and
rings
on
her
temples
where
her
complexion
was
clearest
the
bold
contour
of
her
face
with
its
decided
chin
and
the
rather
large
salient
nose
was
like
her
father
it
was
this
probably
that
gave
an
impression
of
strength
with
a
wistful
qualification
she
was
at
that
time
rather
thin
and
it
could
have
been
seen
that
she
would
be
handsomer
when
her
frame
had
rounded
out
in
fulfilment
of
its
generous
design
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
but
shut
them
again
in
an
effort
at
before
she
said
but
i
really
wish
to
do
it
at
this
moment
i
would
rather
be
in
than
in
oh
very
well
said
the
old
lady
gathering
herself
up
as
one
does
from
throwing
away
one
sympathy
upon
an
unworthy
object
if
you
really
it
i
know
that
it
must
seem
preposterous
and
and
almost
ungrateful
that
i
should
think
of
going
back
when
i
might
just
as
well
stay
why
i
a
great
many
more
friends
here
than
i
have
there
i
suppose
i
shall
be
almost
a
stranger
when
i
get
there
and
there
no
comparison
in
congeniality
and
yet
i
feel
that
i
must
go
back
i
ca
tell
you
why
but
i
have
a
longing
i
feel
that
i
must
try
to
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
try
to
do
some
good
and
in
hatboro
i
think
i
shall
know
she
put
on
her
glasses
and
looked
at
the
old
lady
as
if
she
might
attempt
an
explanation
but
as
if
a
clearer
vision
of
the
veteran
worldling
discouraged
her
she
did
not
make
the
effort
said
the
old
lady
if
you
want
to
be
of
use
and
do
good
she
stopped
as
if
then
there
were
no
more
to
be
said
by
a
sensible
person
and
shall
you
be
going
soon
she
asked
the
idea
seemed
to
suggest
her
own
departure
and
she
rose
after
speaking
just
as
soon
as
possible
answered
miss
kilburn
words
take
on
a
colour
of
something
more
than
their
explicit
meaning
from
the
mood
in
which
they
are
spoken
miss
kilburn
had
a
sense
of
hurrying
her
visitor
away
and
the
old
lady
had
a
sense
of
being
turned
that
the
preparations
for
the
homeward
voyage
might
begin
instantly
ii
many
times
after
the
preparations
began
and
many
times
after
they
were
ended
miss
kilburn
faltered
in
doubt
of
her
decision
and
if
there
had
been
any
will
stronger
than
her
own
to
oppose
it
she
might
have
reversed
it
and
stayed
in
rome
all
the
way
home
there
was
a
strain
of
misgiving
in
her
satisfaction
at
doing
what
she
believed
to
be
for
the
best
and
the
first
sight
of
her
native
land
gave
her
a
shock
of
emotion
which
was
not
unmixed
joy
she
felt
forlorn
among
people
who
were
coming
home
with
all
sorts
of
high
expectations
while
she
only
had
high
intentions
these
dated
back
a
good
many
years
in
fact
they
dated
back
to
the
time
when
the
first
flush
of
her
unthinking
girlhood
was
over
and
she
began
to
question
herself
as
to
the
life
she
was
living
it
was
a
very
pleasant
life
ostensibly
her
father
had
been
elected
from
the
bench
to
congress
and
had
kept
his
title
and
his
repute
as
a
lawyer
through
several
terms
in
the
house
before
he
settled
down
to
the
practice
of
his
profession
in
the
courts
at
washington
where
he
made
a
good
deal
of
money
they
passed
from
boarding
to
in
the
easy
washington
way
after
their
impermanent
congressional
years
and
divided
their
time
between
a
comfortable
little
place
in
nevada
circle
and
the
old
homestead
in
hatboro
he
was
fond
of
washington
and
robustly
content
with
the
world
as
he
found
it
there
and
elsewhere
if
his
daughter
compunctions
came
to
her
through
him
it
must
have
been
from
some
remoter
ancestry
he
was
not
apparently
characterised
by
their
transmission
and
probably
she
derived
them
from
her
mother
who
died
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
of
whom
she
had
no
recollection
till
he
began
to
break
after
they
went
abroad
he
had
his
own
way
in
everything
but
as
men
grow
old
or
infirm
they
fall
into
subjection
to
their
womenkind
their
rude
wills
yield
in
the
suppler
insistence
of
the
feminine
purpose
they
take
the
colour
of
the
feminine
moods
and
emotions
the
cycle
of
life
completes
itself
where
it
began
in
helpless
dependence
upon
the
sex
and
rufus
kilburn
did
not
escape
the
common
lot
he
was
often
complaining
and
unlovely
as
aged
and
ailing
men
must
be
perhaps
he
was
usually
so
but
he
had
moments
when
he
recognised
the
beauty
of
his
daughter
aspiration
with
a
spiritual
sympathy
which
showed
that
he
must
always
have
had
an
intellectual
perception
of
it
he
expressed
with
rhetorical
largeness
and
looseness
the
longing
which
was
not
very
definite
in
her
own
heart
and
mingled
with
it
a
strain
of
homesickness
poignantly
simple
and
direct
for
the
places
the
scenes
the
persons
the
things
of
his
early
days
as
he
failed
more
and
more
his
homesickness
was
for
natural
aspects
which
had
wholly
ceased
to
exist
through
modern
changes
and
improvements
and
for
people
long
since
dead
whom
he
could
find
only
in
an
illusion
of
that
environment
in
some
other
world
in
the
pathos
of
this
situation
it
was
easy
for
his
daughter
to
keep
him
ignorant
of
the
passionate
rebellion
against
her
own
ideals
in
which
she
sometimes
surprised
herself
when
he
died
all
were
lost
in
the
tidal
revulsion
of
feeling
which
swept
her
to
the
fulfilment
of
what
she
hoped
was
deepest
and
strongest
in
her
nature
with
shame
for
what
she
hoped
was
shallowest
till
that
moment
of
repulsion
in
which
she
saw
the
thickly
roofed
and
many
towered
hills
of
boston
grow
up
out
of
the
western
waves
she
had
always
regarded
her
soul
as
the
battlefield
of
two
opposite
principles
the
good
and
the
bad
the
high
and
the
low
god
made
her
she
thought
and
he
alone
he
made
everything
that
she
was
but
she
would
not
have
said
that
he
made
the
evil
in
her
yet
her
belief
did
not
admit
the
existence
of
creative
evil
and
so
she
said
to
herself
that
she
herself
was
that
evil
and
she
must
struggle
against
herself
she
must
question
whatever
she
strongly
wished
because
she
strongly
wished
it
it
was
not
logical
she
did
not
push
her
postulates
to
their
obvious
conclusions
and
there
was
apt
to
be
the
same
kind
of
break
between
her
conclusions
and
her
actions
as
between
her
reasons
and
her
conclusions
she
acted
impulsively
and
from
a
force
which
she
could
not
analyse
she
indulged
reveries
so
vivid
that
they
seemed
to
weaken
and
exhaust
her
for
the
grapple
with
realities
the
recollection
of
them
abashed
her
in
the
presence
of
facts
with
all
this
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
she
was
morbidly
introspective
her
life
had
been
apparently
a
life
of
cheerful
acquiescence
in
worldly
conditions
it
had
been
in
some
measure
a
life
of
fashion
or
at
least
of
society
it
had
not
been
without
the
interests
of
other
girls
lives
by
any
means
she
had
sometimes
had
fancies
flirtations
but
she
did
not
think
she
had
been
really
in
love
and
she
had
refused
some
offers
of
marriage
for
that
reason
iii
the
industry
of
making
straw
hats
began
at
hatboro
as
many
other
industries
have
begun
in
new
england
with
no
great
local
advantages
but
simply
because
its
founder
happened
to
live
there
and
to
believe
that
it
would
pay
there
was
a
railroad
and
labour
of
the
sort
he
wanted
was
cheap
and
abundant
in
the
village
and
the
outlying
farms
in
time
the
work
came
to
be
done
more
and
more
by
machinery
and
to
be
gathered
into
large
shops
the
buildings
increased
in
size
and
number
the
single
line
of
the
railroad
was
multiplied
into
four
and
in
the
region
of
the
tracks
several
large
ugly
windowy
wooden
bulks
grew
up
for
shoe
shops
a
stocking
factory
followed
yet
this
business
activity
did
not
warp
the
old
village
from
its
picturesqueness
or
quiet
the
railroad
tracks
crossed
its
main
street
but
the
shops
were
all
on
one
side
of
them
with
the
cottages
and
and
on
the
other
were
the
simple
square
roomy
old
mansions
with
their
white
paint
and
their
green
blinds
varied
by
the
modern
colour
and
carpentry
of
villas
the
old
houses
stood
quite
close
to
the
street
with
a
strip
of
narrow
before
them
the
new
ones
affected
a
certain
depth
of
lawn
over
which
their
owners
personally
pushed
a
clucking
in
the
summer
evenings
after
tea
the
fences
had
been
taken
away
from
the
new
houses
in
the
taste
of
some
of
the
boston
suburbs
they
generally
remained
before
the
old
ones
whose
inmates
resented
the
ragged
effect
that
their
absence
gave
the
street
the
irregularity
had
hitherto
been
of
an
orderly
and
harmonious
kind
such
as
naturally
follows
the
growth
of
a
country
road
into
a
village
thoroughfare
the
dwellings
were
placed
nearer
or
further
from
the
sidewalk
as
their
builders
fancied
and
the
elms
that
met
in
a
low
arch
above
the
street
had
an
illusive
symmetry
in
the
perspective
they
were
really
set
at
uneven
intervals
and
in
a
line
that
wavered
capriciously
in
and
out
the
street
itself
lounged
and
curved
along
widening
and
contracting
like
a
river
and
then
suddenly
lost
itself
over
the
brow
of
an
upland
which
formed
a
natural
boundary
of
the
village
beyond
this
was
south
hatboro
a
group
of
cottages
built
by
city
people
who
had
lately
come
in
idlers
and
invalids
the
former
for
the
cool
summer
and
the
latter
for
the
dry
winter
at
chance
intervals
in
the
old
village
new
side
streets
branched
from
the
thoroughfare
to
the
right
and
the
left
and
here
and
there
a
queen
anne
cottage
showed
its
chimneys
and
gables
on
them
the
roadway
under
the
elms
that
kept
it
dark
and
cool
with
their
hovering
shade
and
swept
the
with
their
pendulous
boughs
at
places
was
unpaved
but
the
sidewalks
were
asphalted
to
the
last
dwelling
in
every
direction
and
they
were
promptly
broken
out
in
winter
by
the
public
miss
kilburn
saw
them
in
the
spring
when
their
usefulness
was
least
apparent
and
she
did
not
know
whether
to
praise
the
spirit
of
progress
which
showed
itself
in
them
as
well
as
in
other
things
at
hatboro
she
had
come
prepared
to
have
misgivings
but
she
had
promised
herself
to
be
just
she
thought
she
could
bear
the
old
ugliness
if
not
the
new
some
of
the
new
things
however
were
not
so
ugly
the
young
was
handsome
in
his
railroad
uniform
and
pleasanter
to
the
eye
than
the
veteran
incongruous
in
his
stiff
silk
cap
and
his
shirt
sleeves
and
spectacles
the
station
itself
one
of
richardson
massive
and
low
with
spreading
veranda
roofs
impressed
her
with
its
fitness
and
strengthened
her
for
her
encounter
with
the
business
architecture
of
hatboro
which
was
of
the
florid
ambitious
new
york
type
prevalent
with
every
american
town
in
the
early
stages
of
its
prosperity
the
buildings
were
of
pink
brick
faced
with
granite
and
supported
in
the
first
story
by
columns
of
painted
iron
blocks
looked
down
over
the
structures
of
earlier
hatboro
and
a
large
hotel
had
pushed
back
the
tavern
and
planted
itself
flush
upon
the
sidewalk
but
the
stores
seemed
very
good
as
she
glanced
at
them
from
her
carriage
and
their
were
tastefully
arranged
the
apothecary
had
an
interior
of
glittering
neatness
unsurpassed
by
an
italian
apothecary
and
the
besides
its
symmetrical
array
of
pendent
sides
and
quarters
indoors
had
banks
of
fruit
and
vegetables
without
and
a
large
aquarium
with
a
spraying
fountain
in
its
window
bolton
the
farmer
who
had
always
taken
care
of
the
kilburn
place
came
to
meet
her
at
the
station
and
drive
her
home
miss
kilburn
had
bidden
him
drive
slowly
so
that
she
could
see
all
the
changes
and
she
noticed
the
new
with
which
she
could
find
no
fault
the
baptist
and
methodist
churches
were
the
same
as
of
old
the
unitarian
church
seemed
to
have
shrunk
as
if
the
architecture
had
sympathised
with
its
dwindling
body
of
worshippers
just
beyond
it
was
the
village
green
with
the
monument
and
the
tall
and
the
four
small
brass
cannon
threatening
the
points
of
the
compass
at
its
base
stop
a
moment
bolton
said
miss
kilburn
and
she
put
her
head
quite
out
of
the
carriage
and
stared
at
the
figure
on
the
monument
it
was
strange
that
the
first
misgiving
she
could
really
make
sure
of
concerning
hatboro
should
relate
to
this
figure
which
she
herself
was
mainly
responsible
for
placing
there
when
the
money
was
subscribed
and
voted
for
the
statue
the
committee
wrote
out
to
her
at
rome
as
one
who
would
naturally
feel
an
interest
in
getting
something
fit
and
economical
for
them
she
accepted
the
trust
with
zeal
and
pleasure
but
she
overruled
their
simple
notion
of
an
american
volunteer
at
rest
with
his
hands
folded
on
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
as
intolerably
hackneyed
and
commonplace
her
conscience
she
said
would
not
let
her
add
another
recruit
to
the
regiment
of
stone
soldiers
standing
about
in
that
posture
on
the
tops
of
pedestals
all
over
the
country
and
so
instead
of
going
to
an
italian
statuary
with
her
letter
and
getting
him
to
make
the
figure
they
wanted
she
doubled
the
money
and
gave
the
commission
to
a
young
girl
from
kansas
who
had
come
out
to
develop
at
rome
the
genius
recognised
at
topeka
they
decided
together
that
it
would
be
best
to
have
something
ideal
and
the
sculptor
promptly
imagined
and
rapidly
executed
a
design
for
a
winged
victory
poising
on
the
summit
of
a
white
marble
shaft
and
clasping
its
hands
under
its
chin
in
expression
of
the
grief
that
mingled
with
the
popular
exultation
miss
kilburn
had
her
doubts
while
the
work
went
on
but
she
silenced
them
with
the
theory
that
when
the
figure
was
in
position
it
would
be
all
right
now
that
she
saw
it
in
position
she
wished
to
ask
bolton
what
was
thought
of
it
but
she
could
not
nerve
herself
to
the
question
he
remained
silent
and
she
felt
that
he
was
sorry
for
her
oh
may
i
be
very
humble
may
i
be
helped
to
be
very
humble
she
prayed
under
her
breath
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
the
figure
it
was
such
a
modern
such
an
american
shape
so
youthfully
inadequate
so
simple
so
sophisticated
so
like
a
young
lady
in
society
indecorously
exposed
for
a
she
wondered
if
the
people
in
hatboro
felt
all
this
about
it
if
they
realised
how
its
involuntary
frivolity
insulted
the
solemn
memory
of
the
slain
drive
on
please
she
said
gently
bolton
pulled
the
reins
and
as
the
horses
started
he
pointed
with
his
whip
to
a
church
at
the
other
side
of
the
green
that
the
new
orthodox
church
he
explained
oh
is
it
asked
miss
kilburn
it
very
handsome
i
she
was
not
sensible
of
admiring
the
large
romanesque
pile
very
much
though
it
was
certainly
not
bad
but
she
remembered
that
bolton
was
a
member
of
the
orthodox
church
and
she
was
grateful
to
him
for
not
saying
anything
about
the
soldiers
monument
we
sold
the
old
buildin
to
the
catholics
and
they
moved
it
down
ont
the
side
miss
kilburn
caught
the
glimmer
of
a
cross
where
he
beckoned
through
the
flutter
of
the
foliage
they
had
to
razee
the
steeple
some
to
git
their
cross
on
he
added
and
then
he
showed
her
the
building
as
they
passed
and
the
episcopal
chapel
of
blameless
gothic
half
hidden
by
its
japanese
ivy
under
a
branching
elm
on
another
side
street
yes
she
said
that
was
built
before
we
went
i
disremember
he
said
absently
he
let
the
horses
walk
on
the
soft
darkly
shaded
road
where
the
wheels
made
a
pleasant
grinding
sound
and
set
himself
sidewise
on
his
front
seat
so
as
to
talk
to
miss
kilburn
more
at
his
ease
i
he
began
after
clearing
his
throat
with
a
conscious
air
as
you
know
we
got
a
new
minister
to
our
no
i
had
heard
of
it
said
miss
kilburn
with
her
mind
full
of
the
monument
still
but
i
might
have
heard
and
forgotten
it
she
added
i
was
very
much
taken
up
toward
the
last
before
i
left
well
come
to
think
said
bolton
i
do
know
you
had
time
to
heard
he
hai
been
here
a
great
is
he
satisfactory
asked
miss
kilburn
feeling
how
far
from
satisfactory
the
victory
was
and
formulating
an
explanatory
apology
to
the
committee
in
her
mind
oh
yes
he
satisfactory
enough
as
far
forth
as
that
goes
talented
and
he
right
up
with
the
times
yes
he
progressive
i
guess
they
got
pretty
tired
of
rogers
even
before
he
died
and
they
kept
the
supply
till
all
was
blue
before
they
could
settle
on
anybody
in
fact
they
could
seem
to
agree
on
anybody
till
peck
miss
kilburn
had
got
as
far
in
her
tacit
interview
with
the
committee
as
to
have
offered
to
replace
at
her
own
expense
the
victory
with
a
volunteer
and
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
bolton
with
rapt
attention
well
it
like
this
continued
the
farmer
he
progressive
in
his
idees
at
the
same
time
he
and
so
i
guess
he
suits
pretty
well
all
round
of
course
you
ca
suit
everybody
there
always
got
to
be
a
dog
in
the
manger
it
do
matter
where
you
go
but
if
anybody
was
to
ask
me
i
should
say
peck
suited
yes
i
do
know
but
what
i
miss
kilburn
instantaneously
closed
her
transaction
with
the
committee
removed
the
victory
and
had
the
volunteer
unveiled
with
appropriate
ceremonies
opened
with
prayer
by
the
rev
peck
peck
she
said
did
you
tell
me
his
name
was
peck
yes
rev
julius
peck
he
from
down
penobscotport
way
in
maine
i
guess
he
all
miss
kilburn
did
not
reply
her
mind
had
been
taken
off
the
monument
for
the
moment
by
her
dislike
for
the
name
of
the
new
minister
and
the
victory
had
seized
the
opportunity
to
get
back
bolton
sighed
deeply
and
continued
in
a
strain
whose
diffusiveness
at
last
became
perceptible
to
miss
kilburn
through
her
own
humiliation
some
in
every
community
that
bound
to
complain
i
do
care
what
you
do
to
accommodate
and
what
i
done
i
done
as
much
to
stop
their
clack
as
anything
and
give
him
the
right
sort
of
a
start
off
an
i
guess
i
did
but
mis
bolton
she
did
know
but
what
you
look
at
it
in
the
light
of
a
libbutty
and
i
did
know
but
what
you
think
i
no
business
to
done
he
seemed
to
be
addressing
a
question
to
her
but
she
only
replied
with
a
dazed
frown
and
bolton
was
obliged
to
go
on
i
did
let
him
room
in
your
part
of
the
house
that
is
to
say
not
sleep
there
but
i
thought
as
you
was
comin
home
and
i
better
be
airin
it
up
some
anyway
i
might
as
well
let
him
set
in
the
old
judge
room
if
you
think
it
was
more
than
i
had
a
right
to
do
i
willin
to
pay
for
it
git
up
bolton
turned
fully
round
toward
his
horses
to
hide
the
workings
of
emotion
in
his
face
and
shook
the
reins
like
a
desperate
man
what
you
talking
about
bolton
cried
miss
kilburn
are
you
talking
about
bolton
answered
with
a
kind
of
violence
mr
peck
i
took
him
to
board
first
you
took
him
to
board
yes
i
know
it
just
accordin
to
the
letter
o
the
law
and
the
old
judge
was
always
pootty
but
i
took
care
of
the
place
on
twenty
years
now
and
i
hai
never
had
a
chick
nor
a
child
in
it
before
the
child
he
continued
partly
turning
his
face
round
again
and
beginning
to
look
miss
kilburn
in
the
eye
one
to
touch
anything
anyway
and
we
kep
her
in
our
part
all
the
while
mis
bolton
she
seem
to
let
her
out
of
her
sight
she
got
so
fond
of
her
and
she
used
to
follow
me
round
among
the
hosses
like
a
kitten
i
declare
i
bolton
face
the
colour
of
one
of
the
lean
ploughed
fields
of
hatboro
and
deeply
furrowed
lighted
up
with
real
feeling
which
he
tried
to
make
go
as
far
in
the
work
of
reconciling
miss
kilburn
as
if
it
had
been
factitious
but
i
do
understand
she
said
what
child
are
you
talking
about
mr
was
he
married
she
asked
with
displeasure
she
did
not
know
why
well
yes
he
been
answered
bolton
but
she
in
the
asylum
ever
since
the
child
was
oh
said
miss
kilburn
with
relief
and
she
fell
back
upon
the
seat
from
which
she
had
started
forward
bolton
might
easily
have
taken
her
tone
for
that
of
disgust
he
faced
round
upon
her
once
more
it
was
kind
of
queer
his
havin
the
child
with
him
an
takin
most
the
care
of
her
himself
and
so
as
i
bolton
and
me
we
took
him
in
as
much
to
stop
folks
mouths
as
anything
till
they
got
kinder
used
to
it
but
we
did
take
him
into
your
part
as
i
and
as
say
i
willin
to
pay
you
whatever
you
say
for
the
use
of
the
old
judge
study
i
presume
that
part
of
it
a
it
was
all
perfectly
right
bolton
said
miss
kilburn
his
wife
died
anyway
more
than
a
year
ago
said
bolton
as
if
the
fact
completed
his
atonement
to
miss
kilburn
ep
i
told
him
from
the
start
that
it
had
got
to
be
a
temporary
thing
an
i
only
took
him
till
he
could
git
settled
somehow
i
guess
he
means
to
go
to
if
he
can
git
the
right
kind
of
a
he
wants
an
old
one
if
it
was
a
young
one
i
guess
he
would
have
any
great
trouble
if
he
went
about
it
the
right
bolton
sarcasm
was
merely
a
race
sarcasm
he
was
a
very
mild
man
and
his
eyelashes
softened
and
shadowed
his
grey
eyes
and
gave
his
lean
face
pathos
you
could
have
let
him
stay
till
he
had
found
a
suitable
place
said
miss
kilburn
oh
i
goin
to
do
said
bolton
but
i
to
you
just
the
they
came
up
in
sight
of
the
old
square
house
standing
back
a
good
distance
from
the
road
with
a
broad
sweep
of
grass
sloping
down
before
it
into
a
little
valley
and
rising
again
to
the
wall
fencing
the
grounds
from
the
street
the
wall
was
overhung
there
by
a
company
of
magnificent
elms
which
turned
and
formed
one
side
of
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
their
tops
met
and
mixed
somewhat
incongruously
with
those
of
the
stiff
dark
maples
which
more
densely
shaded
the
other
side
of
the
lane
bolton
drove
into
their
gloom
and
then
out
into
the
wide
sunny
space
at
the
side
of
the
house
where
miss
kilburn
had
alighted
so
often
with
her
father
bolton
dog
grown
now
so
very
old
as
to
be
barked
crazily
at
his
master
and
then
recognising
him
broke
into
an
imbecile
whimper
and
went
back
and
coiled
his
rheumatism
up
in
the
sun
on
a
warm
stone
before
the
door
bolton
had
to
step
over
him
as
she
came
out
formally
supporting
her
right
elbow
with
her
left
hand
as
she
offered
the
other
in
greeting
to
miss
kilburn
with
a
look
of
question
at
her
husband
miss
kilburn
intercepted
the
look
and
began
to
laugh
all
was
unchanged
and
all
so
strange
it
seemed
as
if
her
father
must
both
get
down
with
her
from
the
carriage
and
come
to
meet
her
from
the
house
her
glance
involuntarily
took
in
the
familiar
masses
and
details
the
patches
of
short
tough
grass
mixed
with
decaying
chips
and
small
weeds
underfoot
and
the
spacious
june
sky
overhead
the
fine
network
and
blisters
of
the
cracking
and
warping
white
paint
on
the
clapboarding
and
the
hills
beyond
the
bulks
of
the
village
houses
and
trees
the
woodshed
stretching
with
its
low
board
arches
to
the
barn
and
the
tilted
to
sun
against
the
underpinning
of
the
l
and
bolton
pot
plants
in
the
kitchen
window
did
you
think
i
could
be
hard
about
such
a
thing
as
that
it
was
perfectly
right
o
bolton
she
stopped
laughing
and
began
to
cry
she
put
away
bolton
carefully
offered
hand
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bony
structure
of
her
bosom
and
buried
her
face
sobbing
in
the
leathery
folds
of
her
neck
bolton
suffered
her
embrace
above
the
old
dog
who
fled
with
a
cry
of
rheumatic
apprehension
from
the
sweep
of
miss
kilburn
skirts
and
then
came
back
and
snuffed
at
them
in
a
vain
effort
to
recall
her
well
go
in
and
lay
down
by
the
stove
said
bolton
with
a
divided
interest
while
she
beat
miss
kilburn
back
with
her
bony
palm
in
sign
of
sympathy
but
the
dog
went
off
up
the
lane
and
stood
there
by
the
pasture
bars
barking
abstractedly
at
intervals
iv
miss
kilburn
found
that
the
house
had
been
well
aired
for
her
coming
but
an
old
earthy
and
mouldy
smell
which
it
took
days
and
nights
of
open
doors
and
windows
to
drive
out
stole
back
again
with
the
first
turn
of
rainy
weather
she
had
fires
built
on
the
hearths
and
in
the
stoves
and
after
opening
her
trunks
and
scattering
her
dresses
on
beds
and
chairs
she
spent
most
of
the
first
week
outside
of
the
house
wandering
about
the
fields
and
orchards
to
adjust
herself
anew
to
the
estranged
features
of
the
place
the
house
she
found
and
smaller
than
she
remembered
it
the
boltons
had
kept
it
up
very
well
and
in
spite
of
the
earthy
and
mouldy
smell
it
was
conscientiously
clean
there
was
not
a
speck
of
dust
anywhere
the
old
paint
was
spotless
the
windows
shone
but
there
was
a
sort
of
frigidity
in
the
perfect
order
and
repair
which
repelled
her
and
she
left
her
things
tossed
about
as
if
to
break
the
ice
of
this
propriety
in
several
places
within
and
without
she
found
marks
of
the
faithful
hand
of
bolton
in
economical
patches
of
the
woodwork
but
she
was
not
sure
that
they
had
not
been
there
eleven
years
before
and
there
were
darnings
in
the
carpets
and
curtains
which
affected
her
with
the
same
mixture
of
novelty
and
familiarity
certain
stale
smells
about
the
place
minor
smells
as
compared
with
the
prevalent
odour
confused
her
she
could
not
decide
whether
she
remembered
them
of
old
or
was
reminded
of
the
odours
she
used
to
catch
in
passing
the
pantry
on
the
steamer
her
father
had
never
been
sure
that
he
would
not
return
any
next
year
or
month
and
the
house
had
always
been
ready
to
receive
them
in
his
study
everything
was
as
he
left
it
his
daughter
looked
for
signs
of
occupation
but
there
were
none
bolton
explained
that
she
had
put
him
in
a
table
from
her
own
to
write
at
the
judge
desk
was
untouched
and
his
heavy
wooden
stood
pulled
up
to
it
as
if
he
were
in
it
the
ranks
of
in
their
yellow
sheepskin
with
their
red
titles
above
and
their
black
titles
below
were
in
the
order
he
had
taught
bolton
to
replace
them
in
after
dusting
the
stuffed
owl
on
a
shelf
above
the
mantel
looked
down
with
a
clear
solemnity
in
its
eyes
and
bolton
took
it
from
its
perch
to
show
miss
kilburn
that
there
was
not
a
moth
on
it
nor
the
sign
of
a
moth
miss
kilburn
experienced
here
that
refusal
of
the
old
associations
to
take
the
form
of
welcome
which
she
had
already
felt
in
the
earth
and
sky
and
air
outside
in
everything
there
was
a
sense
of
impassable
separation
her
dead
father
was
no
nearer
in
his
wonted
place
than
the
trees
of
the
orchard
or
the
outline
of
the
hills
or
the
pink
of
the
familiar
sunsets
in
her
rummaging
about
the
house
she
pulled
open
a
chest
of
drawers
which
used
to
stand
in
the
room
where
she
slept
when
a
child
it
was
full
of
her
own
childish
clothing
a
little
girl
linen
and
muslin
and
she
thought
with
a
throe
of
despair
that
she
could
as
well
hope
to
get
back
into
these
outgrown
garments
which
the
helpless
piety
of
bolton
had
kept
from
the
as
to
think
of
the
relations
of
the
life
so
long
left
off
it
surprised
her
to
find
how
cold
the
boltons
were
she
had
remembered
them
as
always
very
kind
and
willing
but
she
was
so
used
now
to
the
ways
of
the
italians
and
their
showy
affection
it
was
hard
for
her
to
realise
that
people
could
be
both
kind
and
cold
the
boltons
seemed
ashamed
of
their
feelings
and
hid
them
it
was
the
same
in
some
degree
with
all
the
villagers
when
she
began
to
meet
them
and
the
fact
slowly
worked
back
into
her
consciousness
wounding
its
way
in
people
did
not
come
to
see
her
at
once
they
waited
as
they
told
her
till
she
got
settled
before
they
called
and
then
they
did
not
appear
very
glad
to
have
her
back
but
this
was
not
altogether
the
effect
of
their
temperament
the
kilburns
had
made
a
long
summer
always
in
hatboro
and
they
had
always
talked
of
it
as
home
but
they
had
never
passed
a
whole
year
there
since
judge
kilburn
first
went
to
congress
and
they
were
not
regarded
as
full
neighbours
or
permanent
citizens
miss
kilburn
however
kept
up
her
childhood
friendships
and
she
and
some
of
the
ladies
called
one
another
by
their
christian
names
but
they
believed
that
she
met
people
in
washington
whom
she
liked
better
the
winters
she
spent
there
certainly
weakened
the
ties
between
them
and
when
it
came
to
those
eleven
years
in
rome
the
letters
they
exchanged
grew
rarer
and
rarer
till
they
stopped
altogether
some
of
the
girls
went
away
some
died
others
became
dead
and
absent
to
her
in
their
marriages
and
household
cares
after
waiting
for
one
another
three
of
them
came
together
to
see
her
one
day
they
all
kissed
her
after
a
questioning
glance
at
her
face
and
dress
as
if
they
wanted
to
see
whether
she
had
grown
proud
or
too
fashionable
but
they
were
themselves
apparently
much
better
dressed
and
certainly
more
richly
dressed
in
a
place
like
hatboro
where
there
is
no
and
evening
parties
are
few
the
best
dress
is
a
street
costume
which
may
be
worn
for
calls
and
shopping
and
for
church
and
all
public
entertainments
the
ladies
make
an
effect
of
outdoor
fashion
in
which
the
poorest
shop
hand
has
her
part
and
in
their
turn
they
share
her
indoor
simplicity
these
old
friends
of
annie
wore
bonnets
and
frocks
of
the
latest
style
and
costly
material
they
let
her
make
the
advances
receiving
them
with
blank
passivity
or
repelling
them
with
irony
according
to
the
several
needs
of
their
and
talking
to
one
another
across
her
one
of
them
asked
her
when
her
hair
had
begun
to
turn
and
they
each
told
her
how
thin
she
was
but
promised
her
that
hatboro
air
would
bring
her
up
at
the
same
time
they
feigned
humility
in
regard
to
everything
about
hatboro
but
the
air
they
laughed
when
she
said
she
intended
now
to
make
it
her
home
the
whole
year
round
and
said
they
guessed
she
would
be
tired
of
it
long
before
fall
there
were
plenty
of
summer
folks
that
passed
the
winter
as
long
as
the
june
weather
lasted
as
they
grew
more
secure
of
themselves
or
less
afraid
of
one
another
in
her
presence
their
voices
rose
they
laughed
loudly
at
nothing
and
they
yelled
in
a
nervous
chorus
at
times
each
trying
to
make
herself
heard
above
the
others
she
asked
them
about
the
social
life
in
the
village
and
they
told
her
that
a
good
many
new
people
had
really
settled
there
but
they
did
not
know
whether
she
would
like
them
they
were
not
the
old
hatboro
style
annie
showed
them
some
of
the
things
she
had
brought
home
especially
roman
views
and
they
said
now
she
ought
to
give
an
evening
in
the
church
parlour
with
them
you
have
to
come
to
our
church
annie
said
putney
the
unitarian
does
have
preaching
once
in
a
month
and
peck
is
very
he
liberal
for
some
said
emmeline
gerrish
of
the
three
she
had
grown
the
stoutest
and
from
being
a
slight
girl
she
had
become
a
heavy
matron
habitually
censorious
in
her
speech
she
did
not
mean
any
more
by
it
however
than
she
did
by
her
girlish
frivolity
and
if
she
was
not
supported
in
her
severity
she
was
apt
to
break
down
and
disown
it
with
a
giggle
as
she
now
did
well
i
do
know
about
his
being
liberal
said
wilmington
a
large
blonde
with
a
lazy
laugh
he
makes
you
feel
that
you
a
pretty
miserable
she
made
a
grimace
of
humorous
disgust
mr
gerrish
says
that
just
the
trouble
gerrish
broke
in
mr
peck
do
put
stress
enough
on
the
promises
that
what
gerrish
says
you
must
have
been
surprised
annie
she
added
to
find
that
he
been
staying
in
your
i
was
glad
bolton
invited
him
answered
annie
sincerely
but
not
instantly
the
ladies
waited
with
an
exchange
of
glances
for
her
reply
as
if
they
had
talked
the
matter
over
beforehand
and
had
agreed
to
find
out
just
how
annie
kilburn
felt
about
it
oh
i
guess
he
paid
his
board
said
wilmington
jocosely
rejecting
the
implication
that
he
had
been
the
guest
of
the
boltons
i
do
see
what
he
expects
to
do
with
that
little
girl
of
his
without
any
mother
that
way
said
gerrish
he
ought
to
get
perhaps
he
will
when
he
waited
a
proper
time
suggested
putney
demurely
well
his
wife
been
the
same
as
dead
ever
since
the
child
was
born
i
do
know
what
you
call
a
proper
time
ellen
argued
gerrish
i
presume
a
minister
feels
differently
about
such
things
wilmington
remarked
indolently
i
do
see
why
a
minister
should
feel
any
different
from
anybody
else
said
gerrish
it
his
duty
to
do
it
on
his
child
account
i
see
why
he
do
have
the
remains
brought
to
hatboro
they
debated
this
point
at
some
length
and
they
seemed
to
forget
annie
she
listened
with
more
interest
than
her
concern
in
the
last
of
the
minister
dead
wife
really
inspired
these
old
friends
of
hers
seemed
to
have
lost
the
sensitiveness
of
their
girlhood
without
having
gained
tenderness
in
its
place
they
treated
the
affair
with
a
nakedness
that
shocked
her
in
the
country
and
in
small
towns
people
come
face
to
face
with
life
especially
women
it
means
marrying
household
cares
and
burdens
neighbourhood
gossip
sickness
death
burial
and
whether
the
corpse
appeared
natural
but
ever
so
much
kindness
goes
with
their
disillusion
they
are
blunted
but
not
embittered
they
ended
by
recalling
annie
to
mind
and
putney
said
i
suppose
you
have
been
to
the
cemetery
yet
they
got
it
all
fixed
up
since
you
went
away
drives
laid
out
and
paths
cut
through
and
everything
a
good
many
have
put
up
family
tombs
and
they
taken
away
the
old
iron
fences
round
the
lots
and
put
granite
curbing
they
mow
the
grass
all
the
time
it
a
perfect
putney
was
a
small
woman
already
beginning
to
wrinkle
she
had
married
a
man
whom
annie
remembered
as
a
mischievous
little
boy
with
a
sharp
tongue
and
a
nervous
temperament
her
father
had
always
liked
him
when
he
came
about
the
house
but
annie
had
lost
sight
of
him
in
the
years
that
make
small
boys
and
girls
large
ones
and
he
was
at
college
when
she
went
abroad
she
had
an
impression
of
something
unhappy
in
her
friend
marriage
i
think
it
much
fixed
up
myself
said
gerrish
she
turned
suddenly
to
annie
you
going
to
have
your
father
fetched
home
the
other
ladies
started
a
little
at
the
question
and
looked
at
annie
it
was
not
that
they
were
shocked
but
they
wanted
to
see
whether
she
would
not
be
so
no
she
said
briefly
she
added
helplessly
it
was
his
i
should
have
thought
he
would
have
liked
to
be
buried
alongside
of
your
mother
said
gerrish
but
the
judge
always
a
little
peculiar
i
presume
you
can
have
the
name
and
the
date
put
on
the
monument
just
the
annie
flushed
at
this
intimate
comment
and
suggestion
from
a
woman
whom
as
a
girl
she
had
never
admitted
to
familiarity
with
her
but
had
tolerated
her
because
she
was
such
a
harmless
simpleton
and
hung
upon
other
girls
whom
she
liked
better
the
word
monument
cowed
her
however
she
was
afraid
they
might
begin
to
talk
about
the
soldiers
monument
she
answered
hastily
and
began
to
ask
them
about
their
families
wilmington
who
had
no
children
and
putney
who
had
one
spoke
of
gerrish
large
family
she
had
four
children
and
she
refused
the
praises
of
her
friends
for
them
though
she
celebrated
them
herself
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
two
little
girls
that
ellen
lost
annie
she
said
ellen
putney
i
do
see
how
you
ever
got
over
that
those
two
lovely
healthy
children
gone
and
poor
little
winthrop
left
i
always
did
say
it
was
too
she
had
married
a
clerk
in
the
principal
store
who
had
prospered
rapidly
and
was
now
one
of
the
first
business
men
of
the
place
and
had
an
ambition
to
be
a
leading
citizen
she
believed
in
his
fitness
to
deal
with
the
questions
of
religion
and
education
which
he
took
part
in
and
was
always
quoting
gerrish
she
called
him
gerrish
so
much
that
other
people
began
to
call
him
so
too
but
putney
husband
held
out
against
it
and
had
the
habit
of
returning
the
little
man
ceremonious
salutations
with
an
easy
hello
billy
good
morning
it
was
his
theory
that
this
was
good
for
gerrish
who
might
otherwise
have
forgotten
when
everybody
called
him
billy
he
was
one
of
the
old
putneys
and
he
was
a
lawyer
by
profession
wilmington
husband
had
come
to
hatboro
since
annie
long
absence
began
he
had
capital
and
he
had
started
a
in
hatboro
he
was
much
older
than
his
wife
whom
he
had
married
after
a
protracted
widowerhood
she
had
one
of
the
best
houses
and
the
most
richly
furnished
in
hatboro
she
and
putney
saw
gerrish
at
rare
intervals
and
in
observance
of
some
notable
fact
of
their
girlish
friendship
like
the
present
in
pursuance
of
the
subject
of
children
gerrish
said
that
she
sometimes
had
a
notion
to
offer
to
take
peck
little
girl
herself
till
he
could
get
fixed
somehow
but
gerrish
would
not
let
her
gerrish
said
peck
had
better
get
married
himself
if
he
wanted
a
for
his
little
girl
gerrish
was
peculiar
about
keeping
a
family
to
itself
well
you
think
come
to
board
with
you
said
putney
in
reference
to
peck
the
ladies
all
rose
and
having
got
upon
their
feet
began
to
shout
and
laugh
again
like
girls
they
implied
they
stayed
and
talked
a
long
time
after
rising
with
the
same
note
of
unsparing
personality
in
their
talk
where
there
are
few
public
interests
and
few
events
as
in
such
places
there
can
be
no
nothing
of
the
careless
of
larger
societies
every
one
knows
all
the
others
and
knows
the
worst
of
them
people
are
not
unkind
they
are
mutually
and
freely
helpful
but
they
have
only
themselves
to
occupy
their
minds
annie
friends
had
also
to
distinguish
themselves
to
her
from
the
rest
of
the
villagers
and
it
was
easiest
to
do
this
by
an
attitude
of
criticism
mingled
with
large
allowance
they
ended
a
dissection
of
the
community
by
saying
that
they
believed
there
was
no
place
like
hatboro
after
all
in
the
contagion
of
their
perfunctory
gaiety
annie
began
to
scream
and
laugh
too
as
she
followed
them
to
the
door
and
stood
talking
to
them
while
they
got
into
wilmington
she
answered
with
deafening
promises
when
they
put
their
bonnets
out
of
the
and
called
back
to
her
to
be
sure
to
come
soon
to
see
them
soon
bolton
made
no
advances
with
annie
toward
the
discussion
of
her
friends
but
when
annie
asked
about
their
families
she
answered
with
the
incisive
directness
of
a
woman
she
delivered
her
judgments
as
she
went
about
her
work
the
morning
after
the
ladies
visit
while
annie
sat
before
the
which
she
had
given
her
leave
to
clear
as
she
passed
in
and
out
from
the
to
the
kitchen
she
kept
talking
she
raised
her
voice
in
the
further
room
and
lowered
it
when
she
drew
near
again
she
wore
a
dismal
calico
wrapper
which
made
no
compromise
with
the
gauntness
of
her
figure
her
hair
which
grew
in
a
fringe
below
her
crown
was
plaited
into
small
tags
or
tails
pulled
up
and
tied
across
the
top
of
her
head
the
bare
surfaces
of
which
were
curiously
mottled
with
the
dye
which
she
sometimes
put
on
her
hair
behind
this
was
gathered
up
into
a
small
knob
pierced
with
a
single
the
arrangement
left
bolton
visage
to
the
unrestricted
expression
of
character
she
did
not
let
it
express
toward
annie
any
expectation
of
the
confidential
relations
that
are
supposed
to
exist
between
people
who
have
been
a
long
time
master
and
servant
she
had
never
recognised
her
relations
with
the
kilburns
in
these
terms
she
was
a
mature
yankee
single
woman
of
confirmed
when
she
first
came
as
to
judge
kilburn
twenty
years
ago
and
she
had
not
changed
her
nature
in
changing
her
condition
by
her
marriage
with
oliver
bolton
she
was
childless
unless
his
comparative
youth
conferred
a
sort
of
adoptive
maternity
upon
her
annie
went
into
her
father
study
where
she
had
lit
the
fire
in
the
on
her
way
to
breakfast
it
had
come
on
to
rain
during
the
night
after
the
fine
yesterday
which
gerrish
had
denounced
to
its
face
as
a
at
first
it
rained
silently
stealthily
but
toward
morning
annie
heard
the
wind
rising
and
when
she
looked
out
of
her
window
after
daylight
she
found
a
fierce
storm
drenching
and
chilling
the
landscape
now
across
the
flattened
and
tangled
grass
of
the
lawn
the
elms
were
writhing
in
the
gale
and
swinging
their
long
lean
boughs
to
and
fro
from
another
window
she
saw
the
cuffed
and
hustled
maples
ruffling
their
stiff
masses
of
foliage
and
shuddering
in
the
storm
she
turned
away
with
a
sigh
of
the
luxurious
melancholy
which
a
northeaster
inspires
in
people
safely
sheltered
from
it
and
sat
down
before
her
fire
she
recalled
the
three
women
who
had
visited
her
the
day
before
in
the
figures
of
their
childhood
and
young
girlhood
and
their
present
character
did
not
seem
a
broken
promise
nothing
was
really
disappointed
in
it
but
the
animal
joy
the
hopeful
riot
of
their
young
blood
which
must
fade
and
die
with
the
happiest
fate
she
perceived
that
what
they
had
come
to
was
not
unjust
to
what
they
had
been
and
as
our
own
fate
always
appears
to
us
unaccomplished
a
thing
for
the
distant
future
to
fulfil
she
began
to
ask
herself
what
was
to
be
the
natural
sequence
of
such
a
temperament
such
mental
and
moral
traits
as
hers
had
her
life
been
so
noble
in
anything
but
vague
aspirations
that
she
could
ever
reasonably
expect
the
destiny
of
grand
usefulness
which
she
had
always
unreasonably
expected
the
question
came
home
to
her
with
such
pain
in
the
light
of
what
her
old
playmates
had
become
that
she
suddenly
ceased
to
enjoy
the
misery
of
the
storm
or
the
purring
content
of
the
fire
on
the
hearth
of
the
stove
at
her
feet
the
book
she
had
taken
down
to
read
fell
unopened
into
her
lap
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
a
of
such
piercing
as
only
a
woman
can
endure
when
the
flattering
promises
of
youth
have
grown
vague
and
few
there
is
no
condition
of
life
that
is
wholly
acceptable
but
none
that
is
not
tolerable
when
once
it
establishes
itself
and
while
annie
kilburn
had
never
consented
to
be
an
old
maid
she
had
become
one
without
great
suffering
at
she
could
not
call
herself
anything
else
she
often
called
herself
an
old
maid
with
the
mental
reservation
that
she
was
not
one
she
was
merely
unmarried
she
might
marry
any
time
now
when
she
assured
herself
of
this
as
she
had
done
many
times
before
she
suddenly
wondered
if
she
should
ever
marry
she
wondered
if
she
had
seemed
to
her
friends
yesterday
like
a
person
who
would
never
marry
did
one
carry
such
a
thing
in
one
looks
perhaps
they
idealised
her
they
had
not
seen
her
since
she
was
twenty
and
perhaps
they
still
thought
of
her
as
a
young
girl
it
now
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
had
left
her
youth
in
rome
as
in
rome
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
she
should
find
it
again
in
hatboro
a
pang
of
aimless
unlocalised
homesickness
passed
through
her
she
realised
that
she
was
alone
in
the
world
she
rose
to
escape
the
pang
and
went
to
the
window
of
the
parlour
which
looked
toward
the
street
where
she
saw
the
figure
of
a
young
man
draped
in
a
long
indiarubber
gossamer
coat
fluttering
in
the
wind
that
pushed
him
along
as
he
tacked
on
a
southerly
course
he
bowed
and
twisted
his
head
to
escape
the
lash
of
the
rain
she
watched
him
till
he
turned
into
the
lane
leading
to
the
house
and
then
at
a
discreeter
distance
she
watched
him
through
the
window
at
the
other
corner
making
his
way
up
to
the
front
door
in
the
teeth
of
the
gale
he
seemed
to
have
a
bundle
under
his
arm
and
as
he
stepped
into
the
shelter
of
the
portico
and
freed
his
arm
to
ring
she
discovered
that
it
was
a
bundle
of
books
whether
bolton
did
not
hear
the
bell
or
whether
she
heard
it
and
decided
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
leave
her
work
for
it
when
miss
kilburn
who
was
so
much
nearer
could
answer
it
she
did
not
come
even
at
a
second
ring
and
annie
was
forced
to
go
to
the
door
herself
or
leave
the
poor
man
dripping
in
the
cold
wind
outside
she
had
made
up
her
mind
at
sight
of
the
books
that
he
was
a
canvasser
for
some
subscription
book
such
as
used
to
come
in
her
father
time
but
when
she
opened
to
him
he
took
off
his
hat
with
a
great
deal
of
manner
and
said
miss
kilburn
with
so
much
insinuation
of
gentle
disinterestedness
that
it
flashed
upon
her
that
it
might
be
peck
yes
she
said
with
confusion
while
the
flash
of
conjecture
faded
away
mr
brandreth
said
her
visitor
whom
she
now
saw
to
be
much
younger
than
peck
could
be
he
looked
not
much
more
than
or
his
damp
hair
waved
and
curled
upon
his
temples
and
forehead
and
his
blue
eyes
lightened
from
a
beardless
and
freshly
shaven
face
i
called
this
morning
because
i
felt
sure
of
finding
you
at
he
smiled
at
his
reference
to
the
weather
and
annie
smiled
too
as
she
again
answered
yes
she
did
not
want
his
books
but
she
liked
something
that
was
cheerful
and
enthusiastic
in
him
she
added
wo
you
step
into
the
study
thanks
yes
said
the
young
man
flinging
off
his
gossamer
and
hanging
it
up
to
drip
into
the
pan
of
the
hat
rack
he
gathered
up
his
books
from
the
chair
where
he
had
laid
them
and
held
them
at
his
waist
with
both
hands
while
he
bowed
her
precedence
beside
the
study
door
i
do
know
he
began
but
i
ought
to
apologise
for
coming
on
a
day
like
this
when
you
were
not
expecting
to
be
oh
no
i
not
at
all
busy
but
you
must
have
had
courage
to
brave
a
storm
like
no
the
truth
is
miss
kilburn
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
you
about
a
matter
i
have
at
heart
that
i
desire
your
help
he
wants
me
annie
thought
to
give
him
the
use
of
my
name
as
a
subscriber
to
his
book
there
seemed
really
to
be
a
books
in
his
bundle
and
he
come
to
me
i
had
expected
to
come
with
munger
she
a
great
friend
of
mine
you
have
met
her
yet
but
you
like
her
she
the
leading
spirit
in
south
hatboro
and
we
were
coming
together
this
morning
but
she
was
unexpectedly
called
away
yesterday
and
so
i
ventured
to
call
i
very
glad
to
see
you
brandreth
annie
said
then
munger
has
subscribed
already
and
i
only
second
fiddle
after
all
she
thought
the
truth
is
said
brandreth
i
the
factotum
or
teetotum
of
the
south
hatboro
ladies
book
club
and
i
been
deputed
to
come
and
see
if
you
would
like
to
join
oh
said
annie
and
with
a
thrill
of
dismay
she
asked
herself
how
much
she
had
let
her
manner
betray
that
she
had
supposed
he
was
a
book
agent
i
shall
be
very
glad
indeed
mrs
munger
was
sure
you
would
said
brandreth
joyously
brought
some
of
the
books
with
me
the
last
he
said
and
annie
had
time
to
get
into
a
new
social
attitude
toward
him
during
their
discussion
of
the
books
she
chose
one
and
brandreth
took
her
subscription
and
wrote
her
name
in
the
club
book
one
of
the
reasons
he
said
why
i
would
have
preferred
to
come
with
munger
is
that
she
is
so
heart
and
soul
with
me
in
my
little
scheme
she
could
have
put
it
before
you
in
so
much
better
light
than
i
can
but
she
was
called
away
so
i
hope
for
no
serious
cause
said
annie
oh
no
it
just
to
cambridge
her
son
is
one
of
the
freshman
nine
and
he
been
hit
by
a
oh
said
annie
yes
it
a
great
pity
for
munger
but
i
come
to
you
for
advice
as
well
as
miss
kilburn
you
must
have
met
a
great
many
english
people
in
rome
and
heard
some
of
them
talk
about
it
we
thinking
some
of
the
young
people
here
about
getting
up
some
outdoor
theatricals
like
lady
archibald
campbell
do
you
know
you
know
about
them
he
added
at
the
blankness
in
her
face
i
read
accounts
of
them
in
the
english
papers
they
must
have
been
very
original
but
do
you
think
that
in
a
community
like
hatboro
are
there
enough
who
could
enter
into
the
spirit
oh
yes
indeed
cried
brandreth
ardently
you
no
idea
what
a
place
hatboro
has
got
to
be
you
not
been
about
much
yet
miss
kilburn
no
said
annie
i
have
really
been
off
our
own
place
since
i
came
i
seen
nobody
but
two
or
three
old
friends
and
we
naturally
talked
more
about
old
times
than
anything
else
but
i
hear
that
there
are
great
yes
said
brandreth
the
social
growth
has
been
even
greater
than
the
business
growth
you
no
idea
people
have
come
in
for
the
winter
as
well
as
the
summer
south
hatboro
where
we
live
you
must
see
south
hatboro
miss
kilburn
is
quite
a
famous
health
resort
a
great
many
boston
doctors
send
their
patients
to
us
now
instead
of
colorado
or
the
adirondacks
in
fact
that
what
brought
to
hatboro
my
mother
could
have
lived
if
she
had
tried
to
stay
in
melrose
one
lung
all
gone
and
the
other
seriously
affected
and
people
have
found
out
what
a
charming
place
it
is
for
the
summer
it
cool
and
it
so
near
you
know
the
gentlemen
can
run
out
every
night
only
an
hour
and
a
quarter
from
town
and
expresses
both
ways
all
very
agreeable
people
too
and
cultivated
fellows
the
painter
makes
a
long
summer
he
bought
an
old
and
built
a
studio
miss
jennings
the
has
a
little
box
there
too
chapley
the
publisher
of
new
york
has
built
the
misses
clevinger
and
valence
are
all
near
us
there
one
family
from
chicago
quite
nice
new
england
by
birth
you
know
and
munger
of
course
so
that
there
a
very
pleasant
i
certainly
had
no
idea
of
it
said
annie
i
knew
you
could
have
said
brandreth
or
you
would
have
felt
any
doubt
about
our
having
the
material
for
the
theatricals
you
see
i
want
to
interest
all
the
nice
people
in
it
and
make
it
a
affair
i
think
it
a
great
pity
for
some
of
the
old
village
families
and
the
summer
folks
as
they
call
us
not
to
mingle
more
than
they
do
and
munger
thinks
so
too
and
we
been
talking
you
over
miss
kilburn
and
we
decided
that
you
could
do
more
than
anybody
else
to
help
on
a
scheme
that
meant
to
bring
them
because
i
neither
summer
folks
nor
old
village
families
asked
annie
because
you
both
retorted
brandreth
i
do
see
that
said
annie
but
we
suppose
the
case
for
the
sake
of
argument
what
do
you
expect
me
to
do
in
theatricals
or
out
i
never
took
part
in
anything
of
the
kind
i
ca
see
an
inch
beyond
the
end
of
my
nose
without
glasses
i
never
could
learn
the
simplest
thing
by
heart
i
clumsy
and
awkward
i
get
oh
my
dear
miss
kilburn
spare
yourself
we
do
expect
you
to
take
part
in
the
play
i
do
admit
that
you
what
you
say
at
all
but
we
only
want
you
to
lend
us
your
oh
is
that
all
and
what
do
you
expect
to
do
with
my
countenance
annie
said
with
a
laugh
of
misgiving
everything
we
know
how
much
influence
your
name
has
one
of
the
old
hatboro
names
in
the
community
and
all
that
and
we
do
want
to
interest
the
whole
community
in
our
scheme
we
want
to
establish
a
social
union
for
the
do
you
know
and
we
think
it
would
be
much
nicer
if
it
seemed
to
originate
with
the
old
village
annie
could
not
resist
an
impression
in
favour
of
the
scheme
it
gave
definition
to
the
vague
intentions
with
which
she
had
returned
to
hatboro
it
might
afford
her
a
chance
to
make
reparation
for
the
figure
on
the
soldiers
monument
i
not
sure
she
began
if
i
knew
just
what
a
social
union
is
well
at
first
brandreth
interposed
it
will
only
be
a
supplied
with
the
magazines
and
papers
and
well
lighted
and
heated
where
the
those
who
have
no
families
especially
could
spend
their
evenings
afterward
we
should
hope
to
have
a
kitchen
and
supply
tea
and
coffee
and
oysters
perhaps
at
a
nominal
cost
and
in
the
but
what
have
your
outdoor
theatricals
to
do
but
of
course
you
intend
to
give
the
proceeds
exactly
and
we
want
the
proceeds
to
be
as
large
as
possible
we
propose
to
give
our
time
and
money
to
getting
the
thing
up
in
the
best
shape
and
then
we
want
all
the
villagers
to
give
their
and
make
it
a
success
every
i
see
said
annie
we
want
it
to
be
successful
and
we
want
it
to
be
distinguished
we
want
to
make
it
unique
munger
is
going
to
give
her
grounds
and
the
decorations
and
there
will
be
a
supper
afterward
and
a
little
such
things
are
a
great
deal
of
trouble
said
annie
with
a
smile
from
the
of
her
larger
experience
what
do
you
propose
to
do
what
play
well
we
about
decided
upon
some
scenes
from
and
they
would
be
very
easy
to
set
outdoors
do
you
know
and
everybody
knows
them
and
they
would
be
hard
to
do
the
ballroom
in
the
house
of
the
capulets
could
be
made
to
open
on
a
kind
of
garden
terrace
munger
has
a
lovely
terrace
in
her
grounds
for
and
then
we
could
have
a
minuet
on
the
grass
you
know
miss
mather
introduces
a
minuet
in
that
scene
and
makes
a
great
deal
of
it
or
i
forgot
she
come
up
since
you
went
yes
i
had
heard
of
her
is
a
minuet
at
verona
in
the
time
of
the
scaligeri
rather
well
yes
it
is
rather
but
you
no
idea
how
pretty
it
is
and
then
you
know
we
could
have
the
whole
of
the
balcony
scene
and
other
bits
that
we
choose
to
work
in
perhaps
parts
of
other
acts
that
would
suit
the
yes
it
would
be
charming
i
can
see
how
very
charming
it
could
be
then
we
may
count
upon
you
he
asked
yes
yes
she
said
but
i
do
really
know
what
i
to
brandreth
had
risen
but
he
sat
down
again
as
if
glad
to
afford
her
any
light
he
could
throw
upon
the
subject
how
am
i
to
people
as
you
say
she
continued
i
quite
a
stranger
in
hatboro
i
hardly
know
but
a
great
many
people
know
miss
kilburn
your
name
is
associated
with
the
history
of
the
place
and
you
could
do
everything
for
us
you
refuse
cried
brandreth
winningly
for
instance
you
know
oh
yes
she
an
old
of
then
you
know
how
enormously
clever
she
is
she
can
do
anything
we
want
her
to
take
an
active
part
the
part
of
the
nurse
she
delightfully
funny
but
you
know
her
peculiar
temperament
how
she
hates
initiative
of
all
kinds
and
we
want
somebody
to
bring
wilmington
round
if
we
could
get
them
committed
to
the
scheme
and
a
man
like
putney
he
make
a
capital
mercutio
it
would
go
like
wildfire
we
want
to
interest
the
churches
too
the
object
is
so
worthy
and
the
theatricals
will
be
so
entirely
unobjectionable
in
every
respect
we
have
the
unitarians
and
universalists
of
course
the
baptists
and
methodists
will
be
hard
to
manage
but
the
orthodox
are
of
so
many
different
shades
and
i
understand
the
new
minister
peck
is
very
liberal
he
was
here
in
your
house
i
yes
but
i
never
saw
him
said
annie
he
boarded
with
the
farmer
i
a
unitarian
of
course
it
would
be
a
great
point
gained
if
we
could
interest
him
every
care
will
be
taken
to
have
the
affair
unobjectionable
you
see
the
design
is
to
let
everybody
come
to
the
theatricals
and
only
those
remain
to
the
supper
and
dance
whom
we
invite
that
will
keep
out
the
socially
objectionable
element
the
hands
and
the
oh
said
annie
but
is
the
the
social
union
for
just
that
class
yes
it
for
them
and
we
intend
to
organise
a
system
of
entertainments
lectures
concerts
readings
for
the
winter
and
keep
them
interested
the
whole
year
round
in
it
the
object
is
to
show
them
that
the
best
people
in
the
community
have
their
interests
at
heart
and
wish
to
get
on
common
ground
with
yes
said
annie
the
object
is
certainly
very
brandreth
rose
again
and
put
out
his
hand
then
you
will
help
us
oh
i
do
know
about
that
at
least
you
wo
hinder
us
certainly
then
i
consider
you
in
a
very
hopeful
condition
miss
kilburn
and
i
feel
that
i
can
safely
leave
you
to
munger
she
is
coming
to
see
you
as
soon
as
she
gets
annie
found
herself
sadder
when
he
was
gone
and
she
threw
herself
upon
the
old
lounge
to
enjoy
a
reverie
in
keeping
with
the
dreary
storm
outside
was
it
for
this
that
she
had
left
rome
she
had
felt
as
every
american
of
conscience
feels
abroad
the
drawings
of
a
duty
obscure
and
indefinable
toward
her
country
the
duty
to
come
home
and
do
something
for
it
be
something
in
it
this
is
the
impulse
of
no
common
patriotism
it
is
perhaps
a
sense
of
the
opportunity
which
america
supremely
affords
for
the
race
to
help
itself
and
for
each
member
of
it
to
help
all
the
rest
but
from
the
moment
annie
arrived
in
hatboro
the
difficulty
of
being
helpful
to
anything
or
any
one
had
increased
upon
her
with
every
new
fact
that
she
had
learned
about
it
and
the
people
in
it
to
her
they
seemed
terribly
they
seemed
occupied
and
prosperous
from
her
front
parlour
window
she
did
not
see
anybody
going
by
who
appeared
to
be
in
need
of
her
and
she
shrank
from
a
more
thorough
exploration
of
the
place
she
found
she
had
fancied
necessity
coming
to
her
and
taking
away
her
good
works
as
it
were
in
a
basket
but
till
brandreth
appeared
with
his
scheme
nothing
had
applied
for
her
help
she
had
always
hated
theatricals
they
bored
her
and
yet
the
social
union
was
a
good
object
and
if
this
scheme
would
bring
her
acquainted
in
hatboro
it
might
be
the
to
something
better
something
really
or
more
ideally
useful
she
wondered
what
south
hatboro
was
like
she
would
get
bolton
opinion
which
if
severe
would
be
just
she
would
ask
bolton
about
munger
too
she
would
tell
bolton
to
tell
peck
to
call
to
dine
would
it
be
thought
patronising
to
peck
the
fire
from
the
diffused
a
drowsy
comfort
through
the
room
the
rain
lashed
the
and
the
wind
shrilled
in
the
gable
annie
fell
off
to
sleep
when
she
woke
up
she
heard
bolton
laying
the
table
for
her
one
dinner
and
she
knew
it
was
twelve
because
bolton
always
laid
the
table
just
half
an
hour
beforehand
she
went
out
to
speak
to
bolton
there
was
no
want
of
distinctness
in
bolton
opinion
but
annie
felt
that
there
was
a
want
of
perspective
and
proportion
in
it
arising
from
the
narrowness
of
bolton
experience
and
her
ignorance
of
the
world
she
was
and
she
had
always
lived
upon
the
outskirts
of
hatboro
even
when
it
was
a
much
smaller
place
than
now
but
bolton
had
her
criterions
and
she
believed
in
them
firmly
in
a
time
when
agnosticism
extends
among
cultivated
people
to
every
region
of
conjecture
the
social
convictions
of
bolton
were
untainted
by
misgiving
in
the
first
place
she
despised
laziness
and
as
south
hatboro
was
the
summer
home
of
open
and
avowed
disoccupation
of
an
idleness
so
entire
that
it
had
to
seek
refuge
from
itself
in
all
manner
of
pastimes
she
held
its
population
in
a
contempt
to
which
her
meagre
phrase
did
imperfect
justice
from
time
to
time
she
had
to
stop
altogether
and
vent
it
in
wells
of
varying
accents
and
inflections
but
all
expressive
of
aversion
and
in
snorts
and
sniffs
still
more
intense
in
purport
then
she
held
that
people
who
had
nothing
else
to
do
ought
at
least
to
be
exemplary
in
their
lives
and
she
was
merciless
to
the
in
south
hatboro
which
had
penetrated
on
the
breath
of
scandal
to
the
elder
village
when
annie
came
to
find
out
what
these
were
she
did
not
think
them
dreadful
they
were
small
flirtations
and
harmless
intimacies
between
the
members
of
the
summer
community
which
in
the
imagination
of
the
village
blackened
into
guilty
intrigue
on
the
tongues
of
some
south
hatboro
was
another
gomorrah
bolton
believed
the
worst
especially
of
the
women
i
hear
said
bolton
that
them
women
come
up
here
for
i
do
know
what
they
want
to
rest
but
if
it
from
nothin
all
winter
long
i
guess
they
go
back
to
the
city
poot
tired
they
perhaps
annie
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
enlighten
her
in
regard
to
the
fatigues
from
which
the
summer
sojourner
in
the
country
escapes
so
eagerly
the
cares
of
giving
and
going
to
lunches
and
dinners
the
labour
of
afternoon
teas
the
late
hours
and
the
heavy
suppers
of
evening
receptions
the
drain
of
and
the
slavery
of
amateur
art
study
and
parlour
readings
and
musicales
the
writing
of
invitations
and
acceptances
and
refusals
the
trying
on
of
dresses
the
calls
made
and
received
she
let
her
talk
on
and
tried
to
figure
as
well
as
she
could
from
her
talk
the
form
and
magnitude
of
the
task
laid
upon
her
by
brandreth
of
reconciling
old
hatboro
to
south
hatboro
and
uniting
them
in
a
common
enterprise
mrs
bolton
she
said
abruptly
leaving
the
subject
at
last
i
been
thinking
whether
i
ought
to
do
something
about
peck
i
do
want
him
to
feel
that
he
was
unwelcome
to
me
in
my
house
i
should
like
him
to
feel
that
i
approved
of
his
having
been
as
this
was
not
a
question
bolton
after
the
fashion
of
country
people
held
her
peace
and
annie
went
on
does
he
never
come
to
see
you
well
he
was
here
last
night
said
bolton
last
cried
annie
why
in
the
world
did
you
let
me
know
i
did
know
as
you
wanted
to
know
began
bolton
with
a
sullen
defiance
mixed
with
pleasure
in
annie
reproach
he
was
out
there
in
my
with
his
little
but
do
you
see
that
if
you
did
let
me
know
he
was
here
it
would
look
to
him
as
if
i
did
wish
to
meet
him
as
if
i
had
told
you
that
you
were
not
to
introduce
him
probably
bolton
believed
too
that
a
man
mind
was
agile
enough
for
these
conjectures
but
she
said
she
did
not
suppose
he
would
take
it
in
that
way
she
added
that
he
stayed
longer
than
she
expected
because
the
little
girl
seemed
to
like
it
so
much
she
always
cried
when
she
had
to
go
away
do
you
mean
that
she
attached
to
the
place
demanded
annie
well
yes
she
is
bolton
admitted
and
the
annie
had
a
great
desire
to
tell
bolton
that
she
had
behaved
very
stupidly
but
she
knew
bolton
would
not
stand
that
and
she
had
to
content
herself
with
saying
severely
the
next
time
he
comes
let
me
know
without
fail
please
what
is
the
child
like
she
asked
well
i
guess
it
must
favour
the
mother
if
anything
it
do
seem
to
take
after
him
why
do
you
have
it
here
often
then
asked
annie
if
it
so
much
attached
to
the
place
well
i
did
know
as
you
wanted
to
have
it
round
replied
bolton
bluntly
annie
made
a
tchk
of
impatience
with
her
obtuseness
and
asked
where
is
peck
staying
well
he
staying
at
mis
warner
till
he
can
get
is
it
far
from
here
it
down
in
the
north
part
of
the
village
over
the
is
bolton
at
home
yes
he
is
said
bolton
with
the
effect
of
not
intending
to
deny
it
then
i
want
him
to
hitch
up
now
at
once
right
away
and
go
and
get
the
child
and
bring
her
here
to
dinner
with
annie
got
so
far
with
her
severity
feeling
that
it
was
needed
to
mask
a
proceeding
so
romantic
perhaps
so
silly
she
added
timidly
can
he
do
it
i
but
what
he
can
said
bolton
dryly
and
whatever
her
feeling
really
was
in
regard
to
the
matter
her
manner
gave
no
hint
of
it
annie
did
not
know
whether
bolton
was
going
on
her
errand
or
not
from
bolton
but
in
ten
or
twelve
minutes
she
saw
him
emerge
from
the
avenue
into
the
street
in
the
tightly
curtained
against
the
storm
half
an
hour
later
he
returned
and
his
wife
set
down
in
the
library
a
shabbily
dressed
little
girl
with
her
cheeks
bright
and
her
hair
curling
from
the
weather
and
staring
at
annie
and
rather
disposed
to
cry
she
said
hastily
bring
in
the
cat
bolton
we
going
to
have
the
cat
to
dinner
with
this
inspiration
seemed
to
decide
the
little
girl
against
crying
the
cat
was
equipped
with
a
doily
and
actually
provided
with
dinner
at
a
small
table
apart
the
child
did
not
look
at
it
as
annie
had
expected
she
would
but
remained
with
her
eyes
fastened
on
annie
herself
she
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
where
bolton
had
put
her
down
but
she
let
annie
take
her
up
and
arrange
her
in
a
chair
with
large
books
graduated
to
the
desired
height
under
her
and
made
no
sign
of
satisfaction
or
disapproval
once
she
looked
round
when
bolton
finally
went
out
after
bringing
in
the
last
dish
for
dinner
and
then
fastened
her
eyes
on
annie
again
twisting
her
head
shyly
round
to
follow
her
in
every
gesture
and
expression
as
annie
fitted
on
a
napkin
under
her
chin
cut
up
her
meat
poured
her
milk
and
buttered
her
bread
she
answered
nothing
to
the
chatter
which
annie
tried
to
make
lively
and
entertaining
and
made
no
sound
but
that
of
a
broken
and
suppressed
breathing
annie
had
forgotten
to
ask
her
name
of
bolton
and
she
asked
it
in
vain
of
the
child
herself
with
a
great
variety
of
circumlocution
she
was
so
unused
to
children
that
she
was
ashamed
to
invent
any
pet
name
for
her
she
called
her
in
what
she
felt
to
be
a
stiff
and
fashion
little
girl
and
talked
on
at
her
growing
more
and
more
nervous
herself
without
perceiving
that
the
child
condition
was
approaching
a
climax
she
had
taken
off
her
glasses
from
the
notion
that
they
embarrassed
her
guest
and
she
did
not
see
the
pretty
lips
beginning
to
curl
nor
the
searching
eyes
clouding
with
tears
the
storm
of
sobs
that
suddenly
burst
upon
her
astounded
her
mrs
bolton
bolton
she
screamed
in
hysterical
helplessness
bolton
rushed
in
and
with
an
instant
perception
of
the
situation
caught
the
child
to
her
bony
breast
and
fled
with
it
to
her
own
room
where
annie
heard
its
wails
die
gradually
away
amid
murmurs
of
comfort
and
reassurance
from
bolton
she
felt
like
a
great
criminal
and
a
great
fool
at
the
same
time
she
was
vexed
with
the
stupid
child
which
she
had
meant
so
well
by
and
indignant
with
bolton
whose
flight
with
it
had
somehow
implied
a
reproach
of
her
behaviour
when
she
could
govern
herself
she
went
out
to
room
where
she
found
the
little
one
quiet
enough
and
bolton
tying
on
the
long
apron
in
which
she
cleared
up
the
dinner
and
washed
the
dishes
i
guess
she
get
along
now
she
said
without
the
critical
tone
which
annie
was
prepared
to
resent
she
was
scared
some
and
she
felt
kind
of
strange
i
yes
and
i
behaved
like
a
simpleton
dressing
up
the
cat
i
suppose
answered
annie
but
i
thought
it
would
amuse
you
ca
tell
how
children
will
take
a
thing
i
do
believe
they
like
anything
that
out
of
the
common
well
not
a
great
there
was
a
leniency
in
bolton
manner
which
encouraged
annie
to
go
on
and
accuse
herself
more
and
more
and
then
an
unresponsive
blankness
that
silenced
her
she
went
back
to
her
own
rooms
and
to
get
away
from
her
shame
she
began
to
write
a
letter
it
was
to
a
friend
in
rome
and
from
the
sense
we
all
have
that
a
letter
which
is
to
go
such
a
great
distance
ought
to
be
a
long
letter
and
from
finding
that
she
had
really
a
good
deal
to
say
she
let
it
grow
so
that
she
began
apologising
for
its
length
half
a
dozen
pages
before
the
end
it
took
her
nearly
the
whole
afternoon
and
she
regained
a
little
of
her
by
ridiculing
the
people
she
had
met
vi
toward
five
annie
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
her
door
which
ought
to
have
prepared
her
for
something
unusual
for
it
was
habit
to
come
and
go
without
knocking
but
she
called
come
in
without
rising
from
her
letter
and
bolton
entered
with
a
stranger
the
little
girl
clung
to
his
forefinger
pressing
her
head
against
his
leg
and
glancing
shyly
up
at
annie
she
sprang
up
and
this
is
peck
miss
kilburn
said
bolton
how
do
you
do
said
peck
taking
the
hand
she
gave
him
he
was
gaunt
without
being
tall
and
his
clothes
hung
loosely
about
him
as
if
he
had
fallen
away
in
them
since
they
were
made
his
face
was
almost
the
face
of
the
caricature
american
deep
slightly
curved
vertical
lines
enclosed
his
mouth
in
their
parenthesis
a
thin
beard
fell
from
his
cheeks
and
chin
his
upper
lip
was
shaven
but
instead
of
the
slight
frown
of
challenge
and
which
marks
this
face
in
the
type
his
large
blue
eyes
set
near
together
gazed
sadly
from
under
a
smooth
forehead
extending
itself
well
up
toward
the
crown
where
his
dry
hair
dropped
over
it
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
peck
said
annie
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
pleased
i
am
that
you
found
shelter
in
my
old
home
when
you
first
came
to
peck
trousers
were
short
and
badly
kneed
and
his
long
coat
hung
formlessly
from
his
shoulders
she
involuntarily
took
a
patronising
tone
toward
him
which
was
not
habitual
with
her
thank
you
he
said
with
the
dry
serious
voice
which
seemed
the
fit
vocal
expression
of
his
presence
i
have
been
afraid
that
it
seemed
like
an
intrusion
to
oh
not
the
least
retorted
annie
you
were
very
welcome
i
hope
comfortably
placed
where
you
are
now
quite
so
said
the
minister
i
heard
so
much
of
your
little
girl
from
bolton
and
her
attachment
to
the
house
that
i
ventured
to
send
for
her
but
i
believe
i
gave
her
rather
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
and
that
she
liked
the
place
better
under
bolton
she
expected
some
deprecatory
expression
of
gratitude
from
him
which
would
relieve
her
of
the
lingering
shame
she
felt
for
having
managed
so
badly
but
he
made
none
it
was
my
fault
i
not
used
to
children
and
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
ask
her
name
her
name
is
idella
said
the
minister
annie
thought
it
very
ugly
but
with
the
intention
of
saying
something
kind
she
said
what
a
quaint
name
it
was
her
mother
choice
returned
the
minister
her
own
name
was
ella
and
my
mother
name
was
ida
she
combined
the
oh
said
annie
she
abhorred
those
names
in
which
the
new
england
country
people
sometimes
indulge
their
fancy
and
idella
struck
her
as
a
particularly
repulsive
invention
but
she
felt
that
she
must
not
visit
the
fault
upon
the
little
creature
do
you
think
you
could
give
me
another
trial
some
time
idella
she
stooped
down
and
took
the
child
unoccupied
hand
which
she
let
her
keep
only
twisting
her
face
away
to
hide
it
in
her
father
pantaloon
leg
come
now
wo
you
give
me
a
forgiving
little
kiss
idella
looked
round
and
annie
made
bold
to
gather
her
up
idella
broke
into
a
laugh
and
took
annie
cheeks
between
her
hands
well
i
declare
said
bolton
you
never
can
tell
what
that
child
will
do
i
never
can
tell
what
i
will
do
next
myself
said
annie
she
liked
the
feeling
of
the
little
warm
soft
body
in
her
arms
against
her
breast
and
it
was
flattering
to
have
triumphed
where
she
had
seemed
to
fail
so
desperately
they
had
all
been
standing
and
she
now
said
wo
you
sit
down
peck
she
added
by
an
impulse
which
she
instantly
thought
there
is
something
i
would
like
to
speak
to
you
thank
you
said
peck
seating
himself
beyond
the
stove
we
must
be
getting
home
before
a
great
while
it
is
nearly
i
wo
detain
you
unduly
said
annie
bolton
left
them
at
her
hint
of
something
special
to
say
to
the
minister
annie
could
not
have
had
the
face
to
speak
of
theatricals
in
that
grim
presence
and
as
it
was
she
resolved
to
put
forward
their
serious
object
she
began
abruptly
mr
peck
i
been
asked
to
interest
myself
for
a
social
union
which
the
ladies
of
south
hatboro
are
trying
to
establish
for
the
operatives
i
suppose
you
heard
anything
of
the
scheme
no
i
had
said
peck
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
sit
very
high
and
he
now
seemed
taller
and
more
impressive
than
when
he
stood
it
is
certainly
a
very
good
object
annie
resumed
and
she
went
on
to
explain
it
at
from
brandreth
as
well
as
she
could
the
little
girl
was
standing
in
her
lap
and
got
between
her
and
peck
so
that
she
had
to
look
first
around
one
side
of
her
and
then
another
to
see
how
he
was
taking
it
he
nodded
his
head
and
said
gravely
yes
and
yes
and
yes
at
each
significant
point
of
her
statement
at
the
end
he
asked
and
are
the
means
forthcoming
have
they
raised
the
money
for
renting
and
furnishing
the
rooms
well
no
they
have
yet
or
not
quite
as
i
have
they
tried
to
interest
the
working
people
themselves
in
it
if
they
are
to
value
its
benefits
it
ought
to
cost
them
something
privation
yes
i
know
annie
began
i
not
satisfied
the
minister
pursued
that
it
is
wise
to
provide
people
with
even
harmless
amusements
that
take
them
much
away
from
their
homes
these
things
are
invented
by
people
who
have
no
occupation
and
think
that
others
want
pastimes
as
much
as
themselves
but
what
working
people
want
is
rest
and
what
they
need
are
decent
homes
where
they
can
take
it
besides
unless
they
help
to
support
this
union
out
of
their
own
means
the
better
sort
among
them
will
feel
wounded
by
its
existence
as
a
sort
of
superfluous
yes
i
see
said
annie
she
saw
this
side
of
the
affair
with
surprise
the
minister
seemed
to
have
thought
more
about
such
matters
than
she
had
and
she
insensibly
receded
from
her
first
hasty
generalisation
of
him
and
paused
to
reapproach
him
on
another
level
the
little
girl
began
to
play
with
her
glasses
and
accidentally
knocked
them
from
her
nose
the
minister
face
and
figure
became
a
blur
and
in
the
purblindness
to
which
she
was
reduced
she
had
a
moment
of
clouded
volition
in
which
she
was
tempted
to
renounce
and
even
oppose
the
scheme
for
a
social
union
in
spite
of
her
promise
to
brandreth
but
she
remembered
that
she
was
a
consistent
and
faithful
person
and
she
said
the
ladies
have
a
plan
for
raising
the
money
and
they
applied
to
me
to
second
it
to
use
my
influence
somehow
among
the
villagers
to
get
them
interested
and
the
working
people
can
help
too
if
they
choose
but
i
quite
a
stranger
amongst
those
i
expected
to
influence
and
i
do
at
all
know
how
they
will
take
the
minister
listened
neither
prompting
nor
interrupting
the
ladies
plan
is
to
have
an
entertainment
at
one
of
the
cottages
and
charge
an
admission
and
devote
the
proceeds
to
the
she
paused
peck
still
remained
silent
but
she
knew
he
was
attentive
she
pushed
on
they
intend
to
have
a
a
representation
in
the
open
air
of
one
of
shakespeare
plays
or
scenes
from
one
do
you
wish
me
interrupted
the
minister
to
promote
the
establishment
of
this
union
is
that
why
you
speak
to
me
of
it
why
i
do
know
i
speak
to
you
of
it
she
replied
with
a
laugh
of
embarrassment
to
which
he
was
cold
apparently
i
certainly
could
ask
you
to
take
part
in
an
affair
that
you
did
i
do
know
that
i
disapprove
of
it
properly
managed
it
might
be
a
good
yes
of
course
but
i
understand
why
you
might
not
sympathise
with
that
part
of
it
and
that
is
why
i
told
you
of
it
said
annie
what
part
the
the
why
not
asked
the
minister
i
know
bolton
told
me
you
were
very
liberal
annie
faltered
on
but
i
did
expect
you
as
a
but
of
course
i
read
shakespeare
a
great
deal
said
peck
i
have
never
been
in
the
theatre
but
i
should
like
to
see
one
of
his
plays
represented
where
it
could
cause
no
one
to
yes
said
annie
and
this
would
be
by
amateurs
and
there
could
be
no
in
it
i
wished
to
know
how
the
general
idea
would
strike
you
of
course
the
ladies
would
be
only
too
glad
of
your
advice
and
their
plan
is
to
sell
tickets
to
every
one
for
the
theatricals
and
to
a
certain
number
of
invited
persons
for
a
supper
and
a
little
dance
afterward
on
the
i
do
know
if
i
understand
exactly
said
the
minister
annie
repeated
her
statement
more
definitely
and
explained
from
brandreth
as
before
that
the
invitations
were
to
be
given
so
as
to
eliminate
the
element
from
the
supper
and
dance
peck
listened
quietly
that
would
prevent
my
taking
part
in
the
affair
he
said
as
quietly
as
he
had
listened
of
course
dancing
annie
began
it
is
not
that
many
people
who
hold
strictly
to
the
old
opinions
now
allow
their
children
to
learn
dancing
but
i
could
not
join
at
all
with
those
who
were
willing
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
social
union
in
a
social
disunion
in
the
exclusion
of
its
beneficiaries
from
the
society
of
their
he
was
not
sarcastic
but
the
grotesqueness
of
the
situation
as
he
had
sketched
it
was
apparent
she
remembered
now
that
she
had
felt
something
incongruous
in
it
when
brandreth
exposed
it
but
not
deeply
the
minister
continued
gently
the
ladies
who
are
trying
to
get
up
this
social
union
proceed
upon
the
assumption
that
working
people
can
neither
see
nor
feel
a
slight
but
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
do
annie
had
the
obtuseness
about
those
she
fancied
below
her
which
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
being
brought
up
in
a
superior
station
she
believed
that
there
was
something
to
say
on
the
other
side
and
she
attempted
to
say
it
i
do
know
that
you
could
call
it
a
slight
exactly
people
can
ask
those
they
prefer
to
a
social
yes
if
it
is
for
their
own
but
even
in
a
public
affair
like
this
the
would
feel
uncomfortable
and
out
of
place
would
they
if
they
stayed
to
the
supper
and
the
dance
they
might
be
exposed
to
greater
suffering
among
those
whose
manners
and
breeding
were
different
and
it
might
be
very
embarrassing
all
round
is
there
that
side
to
be
regarded
you
beg
the
question
said
the
minister
as
unsparingly
as
if
she
were
a
man
the
point
is
whether
a
social
union
beginning
in
social
exclusion
could
ever
do
any
good
what
part
do
these
ladies
expect
to
take
in
maintaining
it
do
they
intend
to
spend
their
evenings
there
to
associate
on
equal
terms
with
the
and
hands
i
do
suppose
they
do
but
i
do
know
said
annie
dryly
and
she
replied
by
helplessly
quoting
brandreth
they
intend
to
organise
a
system
of
lectures
concerts
and
readings
they
wish
to
get
on
common
ground
with
they
can
never
get
on
common
ground
with
them
in
that
way
said
the
minister
no
doubt
they
think
they
want
to
do
them
good
but
good
is
from
the
heart
and
there
is
no
heart
in
what
they
propose
the
working
people
would
know
that
at
then
you
mean
to
say
annie
asked
half
alarmed
and
half
amused
that
there
can
be
no
friendly
intercourse
with
the
poor
and
the
unless
it
is
based
upon
social
equality
i
will
answer
your
question
by
asking
another
suppose
you
were
one
of
the
poor
and
the
offered
to
be
friendly
with
you
on
such
terms
as
you
have
mentioned
how
should
you
feel
toward
them
if
you
make
it
a
personal
question
it
makes
itself
a
personal
question
said
the
minister
dispassionately
well
then
i
trust
i
should
have
the
good
sense
to
see
that
social
equality
between
people
who
were
better
dressed
better
taught
and
better
bred
than
myself
was
impossible
and
that
for
me
to
force
myself
into
their
company
was
not
only
bad
taste
but
it
was
foolish
i
have
often
heard
my
father
say
that
the
great
superiority
of
the
american
practice
of
democracy
over
the
french
ideal
was
that
it
did
involve
any
assumption
of
social
equality
he
said
that
equality
before
the
law
and
in
politics
was
sacred
but
that
the
principle
could
never
govern
society
and
that
americans
all
instinctively
recognised
it
and
i
believe
that
to
try
to
mix
the
different
classes
would
be
peck
smiled
and
this
was
the
first
break
in
his
seriousness
we
know
what
is
or
will
be
american
yet
but
we
will
suppose
you
are
quite
right
the
question
is
how
would
you
feel
toward
the
people
whose
company
you
would
force
yourself
into
why
of
course
annie
was
surprised
into
saying
i
suppose
i
feel
very
kindly
toward
even
if
you
knew
that
they
felt
kindly
toward
you
i
afraid
that
would
only
make
the
matter
worse
she
said
with
an
uneasy
laugh
the
minister
was
silent
on
his
side
of
the
stove
but
do
i
understand
you
to
say
she
demanded
that
there
can
be
no
love
at
all
no
kindness
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
god
tells
us
all
to
love
one
surely
said
the
minister
would
you
suffer
such
a
slight
as
your
friends
propose
to
be
offered
to
any
one
you
loved
she
did
not
answer
and
he
continued
thoughtfully
i
suppose
that
if
a
poor
person
could
do
a
rich
person
a
kindness
which
cost
him
some
sacrifice
he
might
love
him
in
that
case
there
could
be
love
between
the
rich
and
the
and
there
could
be
no
love
if
a
rich
man
did
the
same
oh
yes
the
minister
said
upon
the
same
ground
only
the
rich
man
would
have
to
make
a
sacrifice
first
that
he
would
really
then
you
mean
to
say
that
people
ca
do
any
good
at
all
with
their
money
annie
asked
money
is
a
palliative
but
it
ca
cure
it
can
sometimes
create
a
bond
of
gratitude
perhaps
but
it
ca
create
sympathy
between
rich
and
but
ca
it
because
sympathy
common
feeling
the
sense
of
fraternity
can
spring
only
from
like
experiences
like
hopes
like
fears
and
money
can
not
buy
he
rose
and
looked
a
moment
about
him
as
if
trying
to
recall
something
then
with
a
stiff
obeisance
he
said
good
evening
and
went
out
while
she
remained
daunted
and
bewildered
with
the
child
in
her
arms
as
unconscious
of
having
kept
it
as
he
of
having
left
it
with
her
bolton
must
have
reminded
him
of
his
oversight
for
after
being
gone
so
long
as
it
would
have
taken
him
to
walk
to
her
parlour
and
back
he
returned
and
said
simply
i
forgot
he
put
out
his
hands
to
take
her
but
she
turned
perversely
from
him
and
hid
her
face
in
annie
neck
pushing
his
hands
away
with
a
backward
reach
of
her
little
arm
come
idella
he
said
idella
only
snuggled
the
closer
bolton
came
in
with
the
little
girl
wraps
they
were
very
common
and
poor
and
the
thought
of
getting
her
something
prettier
went
through
annie
mind
at
sight
of
bolton
the
child
turned
from
annie
to
her
older
friend
i
afraid
you
have
a
for
your
daughter
peck
said
annie
remotely
hurt
at
the
little
one
fickleness
neither
peck
nor
bolton
smiled
and
with
some
vague
intention
of
showing
him
that
she
could
meet
the
poor
on
common
ground
by
sharing
their
labours
she
knelt
down
and
helped
bolton
tie
on
and
button
on
idella
things
vii
next
morning
the
day
broke
clear
after
the
long
storm
and
annie
woke
in
revolt
against
the
sort
of
subjection
in
which
she
had
parted
from
peck
she
felt
the
need
of
showing
bolton
that
although
she
had
been
civil
to
him
she
had
no
sympathy
with
his
ideas
but
she
could
not
think
of
any
way
to
formulate
her
opposition
and
all
she
could
say
in
offence
was
does
peck
usually
forget
his
child
when
he
starts
home
i
do
know
as
he
does
answered
bolton
simply
he
rather
of
an
man
and
i
suppose
he
like
other
men
when
he
gets
the
child
clothes
were
disgracefully
shabby
said
annie
vexed
that
her
attack
could
come
to
no
more
than
this
i
presume
said
bolton
that
if
he
kept
more
of
his
money
for
himself
he
could
dress
her
oh
that
the
way
with
these
philanthropists
said
annie
thinking
of
hollingsworth
in
blithedale
the
only
philanthropist
whom
she
had
really
ever
known
they
are
always
ready
to
sacrifice
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
any
one
to
the
general
bolton
stood
a
moment
and
then
went
out
without
replying
but
she
looked
as
offended
as
annie
could
have
wished
about
ten
the
bell
rang
and
she
came
gloomily
into
the
study
and
announced
that
munger
was
in
the
parlour
annie
had
already
heard
an
authoritative
rustling
of
skirts
and
she
was
instinctively
prepared
for
the
large
vigorous
woman
who
turned
upon
her
from
the
picture
she
had
been
looking
at
on
the
wall
and
came
toward
her
with
the
confident
air
of
one
sure
they
must
be
friends
munger
was
dressed
in
a
dark
firm
woollen
stuff
which
communicated
its
colour
if
not
its
material
to
the
bonnet
which
she
wore
on
her
plainly
dressed
hair
in
one
of
her
hands
which
were
cased
in
driving
gloves
of
somewhat
insistent
evidence
she
carried
a
robust
black
silk
and
the
effect
of
her
dress
otherwise
might
be
summarised
in
the
statement
that
where
other
women
would
have
worn
lace
she
seemed
to
wear
leather
she
had
not
only
leather
gloves
and
a
broad
leather
belt
at
her
waist
but
a
leather
collar
her
watch
was
secured
by
a
leather
cord
passing
round
her
neck
and
the
stubby
tassel
of
her
umbrella
stick
was
leather
she
might
be
said
to
be
in
harness
she
had
a
large
handsome
face
no
longer
fresh
but
with
an
effect
of
exemplary
cleanness
and
a
pair
of
large
grey
eyes
that
suggested
the
notion
of
being
newly
washed
and
that
now
looked
at
annie
with
the
assumption
of
fully
understanding
her
ah
miss
kilburn
she
said
without
any
of
the
wonted
preliminaries
of
introduction
and
greeting
i
should
have
come
long
ago
to
see
you
but
i
been
dispersed
over
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
ever
since
you
came
my
dear
i
got
home
last
night
on
the
nine
train
in
the
last
agonies
of
that
howling
tempest
did
you
ever
know
anything
like
it
i
see
your
trees
have
escaped
i
wonder
they
were
torn
to
annie
took
her
on
her
own
ground
of
ignoring
their
past
yes
it
was
awful
and
your
son
how
did
you
leave
him
brandreth
oh
yes
poor
little
man
i
found
him
waiting
for
me
at
home
last
night
and
he
told
me
he
had
been
here
he
was
blowing
about
in
the
storm
all
day
such
a
spirit
there
was
nothing
serious
the
matter
the
bridge
of
the
nose
was
all
right
merely
the
cartilage
pushed
aside
by
the
she
had
passed
so
lightly
from
brandreth
heroic
spirit
to
her
nose
that
annie
woman
as
she
was
and
born
to
these
bold
bounds
over
sequence
was
not
sure
where
they
had
arrived
till
munger
added
jim
used
to
these
things
i
thankful
it
was
a
finger
or
an
eye
what
is
she
jumped
from
her
chair
and
swooped
upon
the
annie
had
stood
against
some
books
on
the
table
pending
its
final
disposition
it
only
a
guerra
said
annie
my
things
are
all
scattered
about
still
i
have
scarcely
tried
to
get
into
shape
munger
would
not
let
her
interpose
any
idea
of
there
being
a
past
between
them
she
merely
said
you
knew
the
herricks
at
rome
of
course
i
in
hopes
i
shall
get
them
here
when
they
come
back
i
want
you
to
help
me
colonise
hatboro
with
the
right
sort
of
people
it
so
easy
to
get
the
wrong
sort
but
so
far
i
think
we
succeeded
beyond
our
wildest
dreams
it
easy
enough
to
get
nice
people
together
at
the
seaside
but
inland
no
it
only
a
very
few
nice
people
who
will
come
into
the
country
for
the
summer
and
we
propose
to
make
hatboro
a
winter
colony
too
that
gives
us
agreeable
invalids
you
know
it
gave
us
the
brandreths
he
told
you
of
our
projected
theatricals
i
suppose
yes
said
annie
he
i
know
just
how
you
feel
about
it
my
dear
said
munger
there
myself
as
jim
says
but
it
grows
upon
you
i
glad
you
refuse
outright
and
munger
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
large
expectance
no
i
did
said
annie
obliged
by
this
expectance
to
say
something
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
munger
i
do
see
how
i
to
be
of
any
use
to
you
or
to
oh
take
a
cab
and
go
about
like
boots
and
brewer
you
know
for
the
she
said
this
as
if
she
knew
about
the
humour
rather
than
felt
it
we
are
placing
all
our
hopes
of
bringing
round
the
old
hatborians
in
i
afraid
you
mistaken
about
my
influence
said
annie
mr
brandreth
spoke
of
it
and
i
had
an
opportunity
of
trying
it
last
night
and
seeing
just
what
it
amounted
yes
munger
prompted
with
an
increase
of
expectance
in
her
large
clear
eyes
and
of
impartiality
in
her
whole
face
mr
peck
was
here
said
annie
reluctantly
and
i
tried
it
on
yes
repeated
munger
as
immutably
as
if
she
were
sitting
for
her
photograph
and
keeping
the
expression
annie
broke
from
her
reluctance
with
a
sort
of
violence
which
carried
her
further
than
she
would
have
gone
otherwise
she
ridiculed
appearance
and
manner
and
laughed
at
his
ideas
to
munger
she
had
not
a
good
conscience
in
it
but
the
perverse
impulse
persisted
in
her
there
seemed
no
other
way
in
which
she
could
assert
herself
against
him
munger
listened
judicially
but
she
seemed
to
take
in
only
what
peck
had
thought
of
the
dance
and
supper
at
the
end
she
said
rather
vacantly
what
nonsense
yes
but
i
afraid
he
thinks
it
wisdom
and
for
all
practical
purposes
it
amounts
to
that
you
see
what
my
has
done
at
the
outset
munger
he
never
give
way
on
such
a
oh
very
well
then
said
munger
with
the
utmost
lightness
and
indifference
we
drop
the
idea
of
the
invited
supper
and
do
you
think
that
would
be
well
asked
annie
yes
why
not
it
only
an
idea
i
do
think
you
made
at
all
a
bad
beginning
it
was
very
well
to
try
the
idea
on
some
one
who
would
be
frank
about
it
and
would
go
away
and
talk
against
it
said
munger
rising
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
my
to
see
peck
excuse
me
i
do
think
i
could
said
annie
no
to
see
some
of
his
parishioners
said
munger
his
deacons
to
begin
with
or
his
deacons
this
seemed
so
much
less
than
calling
on
peck
that
annie
looked
out
at
munger
at
her
gate
and
knew
that
she
would
go
with
very
little
more
urgence
after
all
you
know
you
not
one
of
his
congregation
he
may
yield
to
them
said
munger
we
must
him
if
only
because
hard
to
get
it
give
us
an
idea
of
what
we
got
to
contend
it
had
a
very
practical
sound
it
was
really
like
meeting
the
difficulties
on
their
own
ground
and
it
overcame
the
question
of
taste
which
was
rising
in
annie
mind
she
demurred
a
little
more
upon
the
theory
of
her
uselessness
but
munger
insisted
and
carried
her
off
down
the
village
street
the
air
sparkled
full
of
sun
and
a
breeze
from
the
frolicked
with
the
twinkling
leaves
of
the
overarching
elms
and
made
their
shadows
dance
on
the
crisp
roadway
packed
hard
by
the
rain
and
faced
with
clean
sand
which
crackled
pleasantly
under
munger
phaeton
wheels
she
talked
incessantly
i
think
we
go
first
to
gerrish
and
then
to
wilmington
you
know
them
oh
yes
they
were
old
girl
then
you
know
why
i
go
to
gerrish
first
she
care
a
great
deal
and
wilmington
wo
care
at
all
she
a
delicious
creature
wilmington
do
you
think
that
large
indolent
nature
brandreth
says
she
makes
him
think
of
land
in
which
it
seemed
always
afternoon
annie
remembered
lyra
goodman
as
a
long
lazy
girl
who
laughed
easily
and
she
could
not
readily
realise
her
in
the
character
of
a
beauty
with
a
gift
for
humorous
dramatics
which
she
had
filled
out
into
during
the
years
of
her
absence
from
hatboro
but
she
said
oh
yes
in
the
necessity
of
polite
acquiescence
and
munger
went
on
talking
she
the
only
one
of
the
old
hatboro
people
so
far
as
i
know
them
who
has
any
breadth
of
view
whoa
she
pulled
up
suddenly
beside
a
stout
short
lady
in
a
fashionable
walking
dress
who
was
pushing
an
elegant
perambulator
with
one
hand
and
shielding
her
complexion
with
a
crimson
in
the
other
mrs
gerrish
munger
called
and
gerrish
who
had
already
looked
around
at
the
approaching
phaeton
and
then
looked
away
so
as
not
to
have
seemed
to
look
stopped
abruptly
and
after
some
exploration
of
the
vicinity
discovered
where
the
voice
came
from
oh
munger
she
called
back
bridling
with
pleasure
at
being
greeted
in
that
way
by
the
chief
lady
of
south
hatboro
and
struggling
to
keep
up
a
dignified
indifference
at
the
same
time
why
annie
she
added
good
morning
emmeline
said
annie
she
annexed
some
irrelevancies
about
the
weather
which
munger
swept
away
with
robustness
we
were
driving
down
to
your
house
to
find
you
i
want
to
see
the
principal
ladies
of
your
church
and
talk
with
them
about
our
social
union
you
heard
about
it
well
nothing
very
particular
said
gerrish
she
had
probably
heard
nothing
at
all
after
a
moment
she
asked
have
you
seen
wilmington
yet
no
i
have
cried
munger
the
fact
is
i
wanted
to
talk
it
over
with
you
and
gerrish
oh
said
gerrish
brightening
well
i
was
just
going
right
there
i
guess
he
well
we
shall
meet
there
then
sorry
i
ca
offer
you
a
but
there
nothing
but
the
rumble
and
that
would
hold
you
munger
called
this
back
after
starting
her
pony
gerrish
did
not
understand
and
screamed
munger
repeated
her
joke
at
the
top
of
her
voice
oh
i
can
walk
gerrish
yelled
at
the
top
of
hers
both
the
ladies
laughed
at
their
repartee
she
as
jealous
of
wilmington
as
a
cat
munger
confided
to
annie
as
they
drove
away
and
she
just
as
pleased
as
punch
that
spoken
to
her
first
wilmington
wo
mind
she
so
delightfully
indifferent
it
really
renders
her
almost
superior
you
might
forget
that
she
was
a
village
person
but
this
has
been
an
immense
stroke
i
know
she
mused
whether
i
better
let
her
get
there
first
and
prepare
her
husband
or
do
it
myself
no
i
let
i
stop
here
at
she
stopped
at
the
pavement
in
front
of
a
provision
store
and
a
pale
stout
man
in
the
long
of
his
business
came
out
to
receive
her
orders
he
stood
passing
his
hand
through
the
top
of
a
barrel
of
beans
and
listened
to
munger
with
a
humorous
patient
smile
mr
gates
i
want
you
to
send
me
up
a
leg
of
lamb
for
dinner
a
large
last
year
then
suggested
gates
no
year
insisted
munger
and
gates
gave
way
with
the
air
of
pacifying
a
wilful
child
which
would
get
after
all
only
what
he
chose
to
allow
it
all
right
a
large
leg
of
this
year
lamb
grown
to
order
any
peas
spinnage
cucumbers
sparrowgrass
southern
i
suppose
said
munger
well
not
if
you
want
to
call
native
said
gates
yes
i
take
two
bunches
of
asparagus
and
some
any
strawberries
natives
suggested
gates
nonsense
same
thing
natives
of
you
had
better
be
honest
with
gates
said
munger
yes
i
take
a
couple
of
all
right
want
nice
and
the
biggest
ones
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
yes
i
that
what
i
thought
some
customers
wants
the
big
ones
on
top
but
i
tell
it
all
foolishness
just
gates
laughed
a
dry
hacking
little
laugh
at
his
drollery
and
kept
his
eyes
on
annie
she
smiled
at
last
with
permissive
recognition
and
gates
came
forward
used
to
know
your
father
pretty
well
but
i
ca
keep
up
with
the
young
folks
any
he
was
really
not
many
years
older
than
annie
he
rubbed
his
right
hand
on
the
inside
of
his
long
shirt
and
gave
it
her
to
shake
well
you
have
been
about
much
for
the
last
nine
or
ten
years
that
a
eleven
said
annie
trying
to
be
gay
with
the
and
wondering
if
this
were
meeting
the
lower
classes
on
common
ground
and
what
peck
would
think
of
it
that
so
queried
gates
well
i
declare
no
wonder
you
grown
he
hacked
out
another
laugh
and
stood
on
the
looking
at
annie
a
moment
then
he
asked
anything
else
munger
no
that
all
tell
me
gates
how
peck
and
gerrish
get
on
asked
munger
in
a
lower
tone
well
said
gates
he
workin
round
the
deacon
workin
round
gradually
i
guess
i
guess
if
peck
was
to
put
in
a
little
more
brimstone
the
deacon
be
all
right
he
a
great
hand
for
brimstone
you
know
the
deacon
munger
laughed
again
and
then
she
said
with
a
proselyting
sigh
it
a
pity
you
could
all
find
your
way
into
the
well
may
be
it
be
a
good
thing
said
gates
as
munger
gathered
up
her
reins
and
chirped
to
her
pony
he
is
a
member
of
peck
church
she
explained
to
annie
but
he
one
of
the
society
and
his
wife
very
devout
orthodox
he
a
great
character
we
think
and
he
treat
you
very
well
if
you
keep
on
the
right
side
of
him
they
say
he
cheats
awfully
in
the
weight
viii
munger
drove
across
the
street
and
drew
up
before
a
large
handsomely
ugly
brick
store
whose
showy
windows
had
caught
annie
eye
the
day
she
arrived
in
hatboro
i
see
gerrish
has
got
here
first
munger
said
indicating
the
perambulator
at
the
door
and
she
dismounted
and
fastened
her
pony
with
a
weight
which
she
took
from
the
front
of
the
phaeton
on
either
door
jamb
of
the
store
was
a
curved
plate
of
polished
metal
with
the
name
gerrish
cut
into
it
in
black
letters
the
sills
of
the
wide
windows
were
of
metal
and
bore
the
same
legend
at
the
threshold
a
very
prim
ceremonious
little
man
spare
and
straight
met
munger
with
a
ceremonious
bow
and
a
solemn
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
i
hope
i
see
you
well
and
he
put
a
small
dry
hand
into
the
ample
clasp
of
munger
gauntlet
very
well
indeed
gerrish
is
it
a
lovely
morning
you
know
miss
kilburn
he
took
annie
hand
into
his
right
and
covered
it
with
his
left
lifting
his
eyes
to
look
her
in
the
face
with
an
cordiality
why
yes
indeed
delighted
to
see
her
her
father
was
one
of
my
best
friends
i
may
say
that
i
owe
everything
that
i
am
to
squire
kilburn
he
advised
me
to
stick
to
commerce
when
i
once
thought
of
studying
law
glad
to
welcome
you
back
to
hatboro
miss
kilburn
you
see
changes
on
the
surface
no
doubt
but
you
find
the
genuine
old
feeling
here
walk
right
back
ladies
he
continued
releasing
annie
hand
to
waft
them
before
him
toward
the
rear
of
the
store
you
find
gerrish
in
my
room
there
my
growlery
as
i
call
he
seemed
to
think
he
had
invented
the
name
and
gerrish
tells
me
that
you
really
come
back
he
said
leaning
decorously
toward
annie
as
they
walked
with
the
intention
of
taking
up
your
residence
permanently
among
us
you
will
find
very
few
places
like
as
he
spoke
walking
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
he
glanced
to
right
and
left
at
the
on
foot
behind
the
counter
who
dropped
their
eyes
under
their
different
bangs
as
they
caught
his
glance
and
bridled
nervously
he
denied
them
the
use
of
he
permitted
no
conversation
as
he
called
it
among
them
and
he
addressed
no
jokes
or
idle
speeches
to
them
himself
a
system
of
grooves
overhead
brought
to
his
the
cash
from
the
clerks
in
wooden
balls
and
he
returned
the
change
and
kept
the
accounts
with
a
pitiless
eye
for
errors
the
women
were
afraid
of
him
and
hated
him
with
bitterness
which
exploded
at
crises
in
excesses
of
hysterical
impudence
his
store
was
an
example
of
variety
punctuality
and
quality
upon
the
theory
for
which
he
deserved
the
credit
of
giving
to
a
country
place
the
advantages
of
one
of
the
great
city
establishments
he
was
gradually
gathering
in
their
fashion
the
small
commerce
into
his
hands
he
had
already
opened
his
bazaar
through
into
the
adjoining
store
which
he
had
bought
out
and
he
kept
every
sort
of
thing
desired
or
needed
in
a
country
town
with
a
tempting
stock
of
articles
before
unknown
to
the
shopkeepers
of
hatboro
everything
was
of
the
very
quality
represented
the
prices
were
low
but
inflexible
and
cash
payments
except
in
the
case
of
some
rich
customers
of
unimpeachable
credit
were
invariably
exacted
at
the
same
time
every
reasonable
facility
for
the
exchange
or
return
of
goods
was
afforded
nothing
could
exceed
the
justice
and
fidelity
of
his
dealing
with
the
public
he
had
even
some
effects
of
generosity
in
his
dealing
with
his
dependants
he
furnished
them
free
seats
in
the
churches
of
their
different
persuasions
and
he
closed
every
night
at
six
except
saturday
when
the
shop
hands
were
paid
off
and
made
their
purchases
for
the
coming
week
he
stepped
lightly
before
annie
and
munger
and
pushed
open
the
door
of
his
office
for
them
it
was
like
a
bank
parlour
except
for
gerrish
sitting
in
her
husband
swivel
chair
with
her
in
her
lap
she
greeted
the
others
noisily
without
trying
to
rise
you
see
we
are
quite
at
home
here
said
gerrish
yes
and
very
snug
you
are
too
said
munger
taking
one
half
of
the
leather
lounge
and
leaving
the
other
half
to
annie
i
do
wonder
gerrish
likes
to
visit
you
gerrish
laughed
and
said
to
his
wife
who
moved
provisionally
in
her
chair
seeing
he
had
none
sit
still
my
dear
i
prefer
my
usual
he
took
a
high
stool
beside
a
desk
and
gathered
a
ruler
in
his
hand
well
i
may
as
well
begin
at
the
beginning
said
munger
and
try
to
be
short
for
i
know
that
these
are
business
take
all
the
time
you
want
munger
said
gerrish
affably
my
idea
that
a
good
business
man
business
can
go
on
without
him
when
of
course
munger
sighed
if
everybody
had
your
gerrish
she
went
on
and
succinctly
expounded
the
scheme
of
the
social
union
i
suppose
i
ca
deny
that
the
idea
occurred
to
she
concluded
but
we
ca
hope
to
develop
it
without
the
of
the
ladies
of
old
hatboro
and
i
come
first
of
all
to
gerrish
bowed
his
acknowledgments
of
the
honour
done
his
wife
with
a
gravity
which
she
misinterpreted
i
think
she
began
with
her
censorious
manner
and
accent
that
these
people
have
too
much
done
for
them
they
perfectly
spoiled
do
you
annie
gerrish
did
not
give
annie
time
to
answer
i
differ
with
you
my
dear
he
cut
in
it
is
my
opinion
or
i
do
know
but
you
wish
to
confine
this
matter
entirely
to
the
ladies
he
suggested
to
munger
oh
i
only
too
proud
and
glad
that
you
feel
interested
in
the
matter
cried
munger
without
the
gentlemen
practical
views
we
ladies
are
such
feeble
folk
mere
conies
in
the
i
am
as
much
opposed
as
gerrish
or
any
one
to
acceding
to
unjust
demands
on
the
part
of
my
clerks
or
other
employees
gerrish
began
yes
that
what
i
mean
said
his
wife
and
broke
down
with
a
giggle
he
went
on
without
regarding
her
i
have
always
made
it
a
rule
as
far
as
business
went
to
keep
my
own
affairs
entirely
in
my
own
hands
i
fix
the
hours
and
i
fix
the
wages
and
i
fix
all
the
other
conditions
and
i
say
plainly
you
do
like
them
come
or
stay
and
i
never
have
any
i
sure
said
munger
that
if
all
the
employers
in
the
country
would
take
such
a
stand
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
labour
troubles
i
think
we
too
and
i
do
too
munger
cried
gerrish
glad
of
the
occasion
to
be
censorious
and
of
the
finer
lady
opinion
at
the
same
time
that
what
i
meant
do
you
annie
i
afraid
i
do
understand
exactly
annie
replied
gerrish
kept
his
eye
on
munger
face
now
arranged
for
indefinite
photography
as
he
went
on
that
is
exactly
what
i
say
to
them
that
is
what
i
said
to
marvin
one
year
ago
when
he
had
that
trouble
in
his
shoe
shop
i
said
too
concessive
i
said
marvin
if
you
give
those
fellows
an
inch
they
take
an
ell
marvin
said
i
got
to
begin
by
being
your
own
master
if
you
want
to
be
master
of
anybody
else
you
got
to
put
your
foot
down
as
lincoln
said
and
as
say
you
got
to
it
down
gerrish
looked
at
the
other
ladies
for
admiration
and
munger
said
rapidly
without
disarranging
her
face
oh
yes
and
how
much
could
be
saved
in
such
cases
by
a
little
firmness
at
the
outset
mr
marvin
differed
with
me
said
gerrish
sorrowfully
he
agreed
with
me
on
the
main
point
but
he
said
that
too
many
of
his
hands
had
been
in
his
regiment
and
he
could
lock
them
out
he
submitted
to
arbitration
and
what
is
arbitration
asked
gerrish
levelling
his
ruler
at
munger
it
is
postponing
the
evil
exactly
said
munger
without
winking
mr
marvin
gerrish
proceeded
may
be
running
very
smoothly
now
and
sailing
before
the
wind
all
all
nicely
but
i
tell
his
house
is
built
upon
the
he
put
his
ruler
by
on
the
desk
very
softly
and
resumed
with
impressive
quiet
i
never
had
any
trouble
but
once
i
had
a
porter
in
this
store
who
wanted
his
pay
raised
i
simply
said
that
i
made
it
a
rule
to
propose
all
advances
of
salary
myself
and
i
should
submit
to
no
dictation
from
any
one
he
told
me
to
go
to
a
place
that
i
will
not
repeat
and
i
told
him
to
walk
out
of
my
store
he
was
under
the
influence
of
liquor
at
the
time
i
suppose
i
understand
that
he
is
drinking
very
hard
he
does
nothing
to
support
his
family
whatever
and
from
all
that
i
can
gather
he
bids
fair
to
fill
a
drunkard
grave
inside
of
six
munger
seized
her
opportunity
yes
and
it
is
just
such
cases
as
this
that
the
social
union
is
designed
to
meet
if
this
man
had
some
such
place
to
spend
his
evenings
and
bring
his
family
if
he
chose
where
he
could
get
a
cup
of
good
coffee
for
the
same
price
as
a
glass
of
rum
do
you
see
she
looked
round
at
the
different
faces
and
gerrish
slightly
frowned
as
if
the
vision
of
the
social
union
interposing
between
his
late
porter
and
a
drunkard
grave
with
a
cup
of
good
coffee
were
not
to
his
taste
altogether
but
he
said
precisely
so
and
i
was
about
to
make
the
remark
that
while
i
am
very
strict
and
obliged
to
be
with
those
under
me
in
business
one
is
more
disposed
to
promote
such
objects
as
this
of
i
was
you
would
approve
of
it
said
munger
that
is
why
i
came
to
you
to
you
and
gerrish
first
said
munger
i
was
sure
you
would
see
it
in
the
right
she
looked
round
at
annie
for
corroboration
and
annie
was
in
the
social
necessity
of
making
a
confirmatory
murmur
gerrish
ignored
them
both
in
the
more
interesting
work
of
celebrating
himself
i
may
say
that
there
is
not
an
institution
in
this
town
which
i
have
not
contributed
my
humble
efforts
to
to
establish
from
the
drinking
fountain
in
front
of
this
store
to
the
soldiers
monument
on
the
village
annie
turned
red
munger
said
shamelessly
that
beautiful
monument
and
looked
at
annie
with
eyes
full
of
gratitude
to
gerrish
the
schools
the
sidewalks
the
the
free
library
the
introduction
of
electricity
the
projected
system
of
drainage
and
the
various
religious
enterprises
at
various
times
i
am
proud
i
am
humbly
proud
that
i
have
been
allowed
to
be
the
means
of
doing
sustaining
he
lost
himself
in
the
labyrinths
of
his
sentence
and
munger
came
to
his
rescue
i
fancy
hatboro
would
be
hatboro
without
gerrish
and
you
think
that
peck
objection
will
be
seriously
felt
by
other
leading
citizens
is
peck
objection
demanded
gerrish
perceptibly
bristling
up
at
the
name
of
his
pastor
why
he
talked
it
over
with
miss
kilburn
last
night
and
he
objected
to
an
entertainment
which
would
be
open
to
all
to
the
shop
hands
and
munger
explained
the
point
fully
she
repeated
some
things
that
annie
had
said
in
ridicule
of
peck
position
regarding
it
if
you
think
that
part
would
be
bad
or
impolitic
munger
concluded
we
could
drop
the
invited
supper
and
the
dance
and
simply
have
the
she
bent
upon
gerrish
a
face
of
candid
deference
that
filled
him
with
almost
to
bursting
no
he
said
shaking
his
head
and
no
closing
his
lips
abruptly
and
opening
them
again
to
emit
a
final
no
with
an
explosive
force
which
alone
seemed
to
save
him
not
at
all
munger
not
on
any
account
i
am
surprised
at
peck
or
rather
i
am
surprised
he
is
not
a
practical
man
not
a
man
of
the
world
and
i
should
have
much
preferred
to
hear
that
he
objected
to
the
dancing
and
the
play
i
could
have
understood
that
i
could
have
gone
with
him
in
that
to
a
certain
extent
though
i
can
see
no
harm
in
such
things
when
properly
conducted
i
have
a
great
respect
for
peck
i
was
largely
instrumental
in
getting
him
here
but
he
is
altogether
wrong
in
this
matter
we
are
not
obliged
to
go
out
into
the
highways
and
the
hedges
until
the
bidden
guests
have
er
exactly
said
munger
i
never
thought
of
gerrish
shifted
her
baby
to
another
knee
and
followed
her
husband
with
her
eyes
as
he
dismounted
from
his
stool
and
began
to
pace
the
room
i
came
into
this
town
a
poor
boy
without
a
penny
in
my
pocket
and
i
have
made
my
own
way
every
inch
of
it
unaided
and
alone
i
am
a
thorough
believer
in
giving
every
one
an
equal
chance
to
rise
and
to
get
along
i
would
not
throw
an
obstacle
in
anybody
way
but
i
do
not
believe
i
do
believe
in
pampering
those
who
have
not
risen
or
have
made
no
effort
to
it
their
wastefulness
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
keeps
them
down
said
gerrish
i
do
care
it
is
i
do
what
it
is
that
keeps
them
down
i
do
expect
to
invite
my
clerks
or
gerrish
servants
into
my
parlour
i
will
meet
them
at
the
polls
or
the
communion
table
or
on
any
proper
occasion
but
a
man
home
is
i
will
not
allow
my
wife
or
my
children
to
associate
with
those
whose
whose
whose
idleness
or
vice
or
whatever
has
kept
them
down
in
a
country
where
where
everybody
stands
on
an
equality
and
what
i
will
not
do
myself
i
will
not
ask
others
to
do
i
make
it
a
rule
to
do
unto
others
as
i
would
have
them
do
unto
me
it
is
all
nonsense
to
attempt
to
introduce
those
notions
into
put
them
in
yes
said
munger
with
deep
conviction
that
is
my
own
feeling
gerrish
and
i
glad
to
have
it
corroborated
by
your
experience
then
you
drop
the
little
invited
dance
and
supper
i
will
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
it
munger
said
gerrish
pausing
in
his
walk
and
putting
on
a
fine
patronising
smile
you
may
put
me
down
for
any
number
of
tickets
five
ten
fifteen
and
you
may
command
me
in
anything
i
can
do
to
further
the
objects
of
your
enterprise
if
you
will
the
invited
supper
and
dance
but
i
should
not
be
prepared
to
do
anything
if
they
are
what
a
comfort
it
is
to
meet
a
person
who
knows
his
own
mind
exclaimed
munger
got
company
billy
asked
a
voice
at
the
door
and
it
added
glad
to
see
here
ah
putney
come
in
hope
i
see
you
well
sir
cried
gerrish
come
in
he
repeated
with
jovial
frankness
nobody
but
friends
i
do
know
about
that
said
putney
with
whimsical
perversity
holding
the
door
ajar
i
see
that
from
south
hatboro
he
said
looking
at
munger
he
showed
himself
as
he
stood
holding
the
door
ajar
a
lank
little
figure
dressed
with
reckless
slovenliness
in
a
suit
of
black
a
loose
fell
stringing
down
his
shirt
front
which
his
unbuttoned
waistcoat
exposed
with
its
stains
from
the
tobacco
upon
which
his
thin
little
jaws
worked
mechanically
as
he
stared
into
the
room
with
flamy
blue
eyes
his
silk
hat
was
pushed
back
from
a
high
clear
forehead
he
had
yesterday
stubble
on
his
beardless
cheeks
a
heavy
moustache
and
imperial
gave
dash
to
a
cast
of
countenance
that
might
otherwise
have
seemed
slight
and
effeminate
yes
but
i
in
charge
of
miss
kilburn
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
come
in
we
wish
to
consult
you
cried
munger
gerrish
cackled
some
applausive
incoherencies
putney
advanced
into
the
room
and
dropped
his
burlesque
air
as
he
approached
annie
miss
kilburn
i
must
apologise
for
not
having
called
with
putney
to
pay
my
respects
i
have
been
away
when
i
got
back
i
found
she
had
stolen
a
march
on
me
but
i
going
to
make
ellen
bring
me
at
once
i
do
think
i
been
in
your
house
since
the
old
judge
time
well
he
was
an
able
man
and
a
good
man
i
was
awfully
fond
of
the
old
judge
in
a
boy
thank
you
said
annie
touched
by
something
gentle
and
honest
in
his
words
he
was
a
christian
gentleman
said
gerrish
with
authority
putney
said
without
noticing
gerrish
well
i
glad
you
come
back
to
the
old
place
miss
kilburn
i
almost
said
i
should
have
minded
ralph
she
retorted
should
you
well
that
putney
continued
ignoring
the
laugh
of
the
others
at
annie
sally
you
find
hatboro
pretty
exciting
after
rome
for
a
while
i
suppose
but
you
get
used
to
it
it
got
more
of
the
modern
improvements
i
told
and
it
more
more
snap
to
it
i
told
that
there
more
enterprise
in
hatboro
more
real
in
south
hatboro
alone
than
there
is
in
the
quirinal
and
the
vatican
put
you
had
better
come
and
live
at
south
hatboro
putney
that
would
be
just
the
atmosphere
for
you
said
munger
with
aimless
hospitality
she
said
this
to
every
one
is
it
about
coming
to
south
hatboro
you
want
to
consult
me
asked
putney
well
it
is
and
it
is
she
began
better
be
honest
munger
said
putney
you
ca
do
anything
for
a
client
who
wo
be
honest
with
his
attorney
that
what
i
have
to
continually
impress
upon
the
reprobates
who
come
to
me
i
say
matter
what
you
done
if
you
expect
me
to
get
you
off
you
got
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
they
generally
do
they
see
the
sense
of
they
all
laughed
and
gerrish
said
mr
putney
is
one
of
privileged
characters
miss
thank
you
billy
returned
the
lawyer
with
now
munger
out
with
it
you
have
to
tell
him
sooner
or
later
munger
said
gerrish
with
overweening
pleasure
in
her
acquaintance
with
both
of
these
superior
people
he
get
it
out
of
you
her
husband
looked
at
her
and
she
fell
silent
munger
swept
her
with
a
tolerant
smile
as
she
looked
up
at
putney
why
it
really
miss
kilburn
affair
she
began
and
she
laid
the
case
before
the
lawyer
with
a
fulness
that
made
annie
wince
putney
took
a
piece
of
tobacco
from
his
pocket
and
tore
off
a
morsel
with
his
teeth
excuse
me
annie
it
a
beastly
habit
but
it
saved
me
from
something
worse
do
know
what
i
been
but
anybody
in
hatboro
can
tell
you
i
made
my
shame
so
public
that
it
no
use
trying
to
blink
the
past
you
do
have
to
be
a
hypocrite
in
a
place
where
everybody
seen
you
in
the
gutter
that
the
only
advantage
i
got
over
my
and
of
course
i
abuse
it
that
nature
you
know
when
i
began
to
pull
up
i
found
that
tobacco
helped
me
i
smoked
and
chewed
both
now
i
only
chew
well
he
said
dropping
the
pathetic
simplicity
with
which
he
had
spoken
and
turning
with
a
fierce
jocularity
from
the
shocked
and
pitying
look
in
annie
face
to
munger
what
do
you
propose
to
do
brother
peck
head
seems
to
be
pretty
level
in
the
yes
said
munger
willing
to
put
the
case
impartially
and
i
should
be
perfectly
willing
to
drop
the
invited
dance
and
supper
if
it
was
thought
best
though
i
must
say
i
do
at
all
agree
with
peck
in
principle
i
do
see
what
would
become
of
you
ought
to
be
in
politics
munger
said
putney
your
readiness
to
sacrifice
principle
to
expediency
shows
what
a
reform
will
be
wrought
when
you
ladies
get
the
suffrage
what
does
brother
gerrish
think
no
no
said
munger
we
want
an
impartial
i
always
think
as
brother
gerrish
thinks
said
putney
i
guess
you
better
give
up
the
fandango
hey
billy
no
sir
no
putney
answered
the
merchant
nervously
i
ca
agree
with
you
and
i
will
tell
you
why
he
gave
his
reasons
with
some
abatement
of
pomp
and
detail
and
with
the
tremulous
eagerness
of
a
solemn
man
who
expects
a
sarcastic
rejoinder
it
would
be
a
bad
precedent
this
town
is
full
now
of
a
class
of
persons
who
are
using
every
opportunity
to
to
abuse
their
privileges
and
this
would
be
simply
adding
fuel
to
the
do
you
really
think
so
billy
asked
the
lawyer
with
cool
derision
well
we
all
abuse
our
privileges
at
every
opportunity
of
course
i
was
just
saying
that
i
abused
mine
and
i
suppose
those
fellows
would
abuse
theirs
if
you
happened
to
hurt
their
wives
and
daughters
feelings
and
how
are
you
going
to
manage
are
you
afraid
that
they
will
hang
around
after
the
show
indefinitely
unless
you
ask
all
those
who
have
not
received
invitations
to
the
dance
and
supper
to
clear
the
grounds
as
they
do
in
the
circus
when
the
minstrels
are
going
to
give
a
performance
not
included
in
the
price
of
admission
mind
i
do
care
anything
about
your
social
oh
but
cried
munger
you
allow
that
it
a
good
well
perhaps
it
is
if
it
will
keep
the
men
away
from
the
yes
i
guess
it
is
you
wo
sell
liquor
we
expect
to
furnish
coffee
at
cost
price
said
munger
smiling
at
putney
joke
and
good
too
i
hope
but
you
see
it
would
be
rather
awkward
do
you
you
see
annie
yes
i
see
said
annie
i
had
thought
of
that
part
and
you
did
agree
with
brother
peck
on
general
principles
there
we
see
the
effect
of
residence
abroad
said
putney
the
uncorrupted
or
i
will
say
the
uninterrupted
hatborian
has
none
of
those
aristocratic
predilections
of
yours
annie
he
grows
up
in
a
community
where
there
is
neither
poverty
nor
richness
and
where
political
economy
can
show
by
the
figures
that
the
profligate
shop
hands
get
of
the
profits
and
starve
on
while
the
good
little
company
rolls
in
luxury
on
the
other
tenth
but
you
got
used
to
something
different
over
there
and
of
course
brother
peck
ideas
startled
you
well
i
suppose
i
should
have
been
just
so
mr
putney
has
never
felt
just
right
about
the
since
he
lost
the
boycotters
case
said
gerrish
with
a
snicker
oh
come
now
billy
why
did
you
give
me
away
said
putney
with
mock
suffering
well
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
own
up
munger
it
no
use
trying
to
keep
it
from
you
know
it
already
yes
annie
i
defended
some
poor
devils
here
for
combining
to
injure
a
man
for
doing
once
just
what
the
big
manufacturing
trusts
do
every
day
of
the
year
with
impunity
and
i
lost
the
case
i
expected
to
i
told
they
were
wrong
but
i
did
my
best
for
you
fools
said
i
that
the
way
i
talk
to
annie
i
call
pet
names
they
like
it
they
used
to
they
get
every
day
in
the
newspapers
fools
said
i
do
you
want
to
boycott
for
when
you
can
what
do
you
want
to
break
the
laws
for
when
you
can
you
idiots
you
said
i
do
you
putter
round
for
persecuting
men
that
have
as
good
a
right
to
earn
their
bread
as
you
when
you
might
make
the
whole
united
states
of
america
a
labour
union
of
course
i
did
say
that
in
oh
how
delicious
you
are
putney
said
munger
glad
you
like
me
munger
putney
replied
yes
you
delightful
said
the
lady
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
drollery
which
they
had
all
pretended
to
enjoy
gerrish
and
gerrish
by
his
leave
even
more
than
the
others
but
you
not
candid
all
this
does
help
us
to
a
conclusion
would
you
give
up
the
invited
dance
and
supper
or
would
you
that
the
and
no
shirking
hey
asked
putney
no
putney
glanced
through
a
little
transparent
space
in
the
windows
framing
the
room
which
gerrish
used
for
keeping
an
eye
on
his
to
see
that
they
did
not
sit
down
hello
he
exclaimed
there
morrell
let
put
the
case
to
he
opened
the
door
and
called
down
the
store
come
in
here
doc
what
called
back
an
amused
voice
and
after
a
moment
steps
approached
and
morrell
hesitated
at
the
open
door
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
slight
stoop
well
dressed
full
bearded
with
kind
boyish
blue
eyes
that
twinkled
in
fascinating
friendliness
upon
the
group
nobody
sick
here
i
hope
walk
right
in
sir
come
in
morrell
said
gerrish
mrs
munger
and
gerrish
you
know
present
you
to
miss
kilburn
who
has
come
to
make
her
home
among
us
after
a
prolonged
residence
abroad
morrell
miss
no
there
nobody
sick
here
in
one
sense
said
putney
when
the
doctor
had
greeted
the
ladies
but
we
want
your
advice
all
the
same
munger
is
in
a
pretty
bad
way
morally
do
you
mind
putney
doctor
screamed
gerrish
putney
said
with
respectful
recognition
of
the
poor
woman
attempt
to
be
arch
i
try
to
keep
within
the
bounds
of
truth
in
stating
the
case
he
went
on
to
state
it
with
so
much
gravity
and
scrupulosity
and
with
so
many
appeals
to
munger
to
correct
him
if
he
were
wrong
that
the
doctor
was
shaking
with
laughter
when
putney
came
to
an
end
with
unbroken
seriousness
at
each
repetition
of
the
facts
annie
relation
to
them
grew
more
intolerable
and
she
suspected
putney
of
an
intention
to
punish
her
well
what
do
you
say
he
demanded
of
the
doctor
ha
ha
ha
ah
ha
laughed
the
doctor
shutting
his
eyes
and
throwing
back
his
head
seems
to
consider
it
a
matter
said
putney
to
munger
yes
and
that
is
all
your
fault
said
munger
trying
with
the
ineffectiveness
of
a
large
woman
to
pout
no
no
i
not
began
the
doctor
smiling
perhaps
suggested
putney
the
doctor
went
off
again
then
i
beg
i
your
pardon
munger
he
resumed
but
it
is
a
professional
question
you
know
and
i
i
really
could
judge
have
any
opinion
on
such
a
no
shirking
said
putney
that
what
munger
said
to
of
course
not
gurgled
the
doctor
you
ladies
will
know
what
to
do
sure
should
he
added
well
i
must
be
going
said
putney
sorry
to
leave
you
in
this
fix
he
flashed
out
of
the
door
and
suddenly
came
back
to
offer
annie
his
hand
i
beg
your
pardon
annie
i
going
to
make
ellen
bring
me
round
good
he
bowed
cursorily
to
the
rest
wait
i
go
with
you
putney
said
the
doctor
munger
rose
and
annie
with
her
we
must
go
too
she
said
taken
up
gerrish
time
most
unconscionably
and
now
gerrish
did
not
urge
her
to
remain
well
said
gerrish
with
a
genteel
prolongation
of
the
last
syllable
gerrish
followed
his
guests
down
the
store
and
even
out
upon
the
sidewalk
where
he
presided
with
unheeded
hospitality
over
the
superfluous
politeness
of
putney
and
morrell
in
putting
munger
and
annie
into
the
phaeton
munger
attempted
to
drive
away
without
having
taken
up
her
hitching
weight
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
post
in
this
town
that
my
wife
has
tried
to
pull
up
in
that
way
said
putney
gravely
the
doctor
doubled
himself
down
with
another
fit
of
laughing
annie
wanted
to
laugh
too
but
she
did
not
like
his
laughing
she
questioned
if
it
were
not
undignified
she
felt
that
it
might
be
disrespectful
then
she
asked
herself
why
he
should
respect
her
ix
that
was
a
great
success
said
munger
as
they
drove
away
annie
said
nothing
and
she
added
do
you
think
so
well
i
confess
said
annie
i
do
see
how
exactly
do
you
mean
with
regard
to
gerrish
oh
no
i
do
care
anything
about
him
said
munger
touching
her
pony
with
the
tip
of
her
he
an
odious
little
creature
and
i
knew
that
he
would
go
for
the
dance
and
supper
because
peck
was
opposed
to
them
he
one
of
the
party
in
his
church
and
that
is
the
reason
i
spoke
to
him
but
i
meant
the
other
gentlemen
you
saw
how
they
took
i
saw
that
they
both
made
fun
of
it
said
annie
yes
that
just
the
point
it
so
fortunate
they
were
frank
about
it
it
throws
a
new
light
on
it
and
if
that
the
way
nice
people
are
going
to
look
at
it
why
we
must
give
up
the
idea
i
quite
prepared
to
do
so
but
i
want
to
see
wilmington
mrs
munger
said
annie
uneasily
i
would
rather
not
see
wilmington
with
you
on
this
subject
i
should
be
of
no
my
dear
you
would
be
of
the
use
persisted
munger
and
she
laid
her
arm
across
annie
lap
as
if
to
prevent
her
jumping
out
of
the
phaeton
as
wilmington
old
friend
you
will
have
the
greatest
influence
with
but
i
do
know
that
i
wish
to
influence
her
in
favour
of
the
supper
and
dance
i
do
know
that
i
believe
in
them
said
annie
cowed
and
troubled
by
the
affair
that
does
make
the
slightest
difference
said
munger
impartially
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
keep
still
i
will
put
the
case
to
she
checked
the
pony
before
the
bar
which
the
flagman
at
the
railroad
crossing
had
let
down
while
a
long
freight
train
clattered
deafeningly
by
and
then
drove
bumping
and
jouncing
across
the
tracks
i
suppose
you
remember
what
the
track
means
in
hatboro
oh
yes
said
annie
with
a
smile
social
perdition
at
the
least
you
do
mean
that
wilmington
lives
the
track
yes
it
is
so
bad
as
it
used
to
be
socially
wilmington
has
built
a
very
fine
house
on
this
side
and
there
are
several
pretty
queen
anne
cottages
going
they
drove
along
under
the
elms
which
here
stood
somewhat
at
random
about
the
wide
grassless
street
between
the
high
windowy
bulks
of
the
shoe
shops
and
hat
shops
the
dust
gradually
freed
itself
from
the
cinders
about
the
tracks
and
it
hardened
into
a
handsome
newly
made
road
beyond
the
houses
of
the
shop
hands
they
passed
some
open
lots
and
then
on
a
pleasant
rise
of
ground
they
came
to
a
stately
residence
lifted
still
higher
on
its
underpinning
of
granite
blocks
it
was
built
in
a
boston
suburban
taste
of
twenty
years
ago
with
a
lofty
and
it
was
painted
the
colour
which
was
once
esteemed
for
being
so
quiet
the
lawn
before
it
sloped
down
to
the
road
where
it
ended
smoothly
at
the
brink
of
a
neat
stone
wall
a
black
asphalt
path
curved
from
the
steps
by
which
you
mounted
from
the
street
to
the
steps
by
which
you
mounted
to
the
heavy
portico
before
the
massive
black
walnut
doors
the
ladies
were
shown
into
the
from
which
the
notes
of
a
piano
were
sounding
when
they
rang
and
wilmington
rose
from
the
instrument
to
meet
them
a
young
man
who
had
been
standing
beside
her
turned
away
wilmington
was
dressed
in
a
light
morning
dress
with
a
watteau
fall
whose
delicate
russets
and
faded
reds
and
yellows
heightened
the
richness
of
her
complexion
and
hair
why
annie
she
said
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
and
you
too
munger
how
nice
her
words
took
value
from
the
thick
mellow
tones
of
her
voice
and
passed
for
much
more
than
they
were
worth
intrinsically
she
moved
lazily
about
and
got
them
into
chairs
and
was
not
resentful
when
munger
broke
out
with
how
hot
you
have
it
have
we
we
had
the
furnace
lighted
yesterday
and
we
been
in
all
the
morning
and
so
we
had
noticed
jack
wo
you
shut
the
register
she
drawled
over
her
shoulder
this
is
my
nephew
jack
wilmington
miss
kilburn
wilmington
and
munger
are
old
the
young
fellow
bowed
silently
and
annie
instantly
took
a
dislike
to
him
his
heavy
jaw
long
eyes
and
low
forehead
almost
hidden
under
a
thick
bang
he
sat
down
cornerwise
on
a
chair
and
listened
with
a
scornful
thrust
of
his
thick
lips
to
their
talk
munger
was
not
abashed
by
him
she
opened
her
budget
with
all
her
robust
authority
and
once
more
put
annie
to
shame
when
she
came
to
the
question
of
the
invited
supper
and
dance
and
having
previously
committed
wilmington
in
favour
of
the
general
scheme
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
that
part
jack
wilmington
answered
for
her
i
should
think
you
had
a
right
to
do
what
you
please
about
it
it
none
of
the
hands
business
if
you
do
choose
to
ask
yes
that
what
any
one
would
think
in
the
abstract
said
munger
now
little
boy
said
wilmington
with
indolent
amusement
putting
out
a
silencing
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
young
man
do
you
be
so
fast
you
let
your
aunty
speak
for
herself
i
do
know
about
not
letting
the
hands
stay
to
the
dance
and
supper
munger
you
know
i
might
feel
upon
i
used
to
be
one
of
the
hands
myself
yes
annie
there
was
a
time
after
you
went
away
and
after
father
died
when
i
actually
fell
so
low
as
to
work
for
an
honest
i
think
i
heard
lyra
said
annie
but
i
had
the
fact
in
connection
with
what
had
been
said
made
her
still
more
uncomfortable
well
i
did
work
very
hard
and
i
did
have
to
work
long
but
i
was
a
hand
and
there
no
use
trying
to
deny
it
as
putney
says
he
and
i
have
our
record
and
we
do
have
to
make
any
pretences
and
the
question
is
whether
i
ought
to
go
back
on
my
oh
but
said
munger
with
intense
deprecation
that
such
a
very
different
thing
you
were
not
brought
up
to
it
it
was
just
temporary
and
besides
and
besides
there
was
wilmington
i
know
he
was
very
opportune
i
might
have
been
a
hand
at
this
moment
if
wilmington
had
not
come
along
and
invited
me
to
be
a
head
the
head
of
his
house
but
i
do
know
annie
whether
i
ought
to
remember
my
low
i
suppose
we
all
like
to
be
consistent
answered
annie
aimlessly
uneasily
yes
munger
broke
in
but
they
were
not
your
beginnings
wilmington
they
were
your
incidents
your
it
very
pretty
of
you
to
say
so
munger
drawled
wilmington
but
i
guess
i
must
oppose
the
little
invited
dance
and
supper
on
principle
we
all
like
to
be
consistent
as
annie
says
even
if
inconsistent
in
the
attempt
she
added
with
a
laugh
very
well
then
exclaimed
munger
we
them
as
i
said
to
miss
kilburn
on
our
way
here
wilmington
is
opposed
to
them
we
drop
them
oh
am
i
such
an
influential
person
said
wilmington
with
a
shrug
it
rather
awful
is
it
annie
not
at
all
munger
answered
for
annie
we
just
been
talking
the
matter
over
with
putney
and
morrell
and
they
both
opposed
you
merely
the
straw
that
breaks
the
camel
back
oh
you
that
a
great
well
and
now
the
question
is
will
you
take
the
part
of
the
nurse
or
not
in
the
dramatics
asked
munger
returning
to
business
well
i
must
think
about
that
and
i
must
ask
wilmington
jack
she
called
over
her
shoulder
to
the
young
man
at
the
window
do
you
think
your
uncle
would
approve
of
me
as
juliet
nurse
you
better
ask
him
growled
the
young
fellow
well
said
wilmington
with
another
laugh
i
think
it
over
thank
you
said
munger
and
now
we
must
really
be
going
she
added
pulling
out
her
watch
by
its
leathern
guard
not
till
you
had
lunch
said
wilmington
rising
with
the
ladies
you
must
stay
annie
i
shall
not
excuse
well
said
munger
complying
without
regard
to
annie
all
this
diplomacy
is
certainly
very
lunch
will
be
on
the
table
in
one
moment
returned
wilmington
as
the
ladies
sat
down
again
provisionally
will
you
join
us
jack
no
i
going
to
the
office
said
the
nephew
bowing
himself
out
of
the
room
jack
learning
to
be
superintendent
said
wilmington
lifting
her
teasing
voice
to
make
him
hear
her
in
the
hall
and
he
been
spending
the
whole
morning
in
the
richly
appointed
a
glitter
of
china
and
glass
and
a
mass
of
carven
oak
the
table
was
laid
for
two
put
another
plate
norah
said
wilmington
carelessly
there
was
bouillon
in
teacups
chicken
cutlets
in
white
sauce
and
luscious
strawberries
a
cook
cried
munger
over
the
cutlets
yes
she
a
treasure
i
do
deny
it
said
wilmington
x
by
the
end
of
may
most
of
the
summer
folk
had
come
to
their
cottages
in
south
hatboro
one
after
another
the
ladies
called
upon
annie
they
all
talked
to
her
of
the
social
union
and
it
seemed
to
be
agreed
that
it
was
fully
in
train
though
what
was
really
in
train
was
the
entertainment
to
be
given
at
munger
for
the
benefit
of
the
union
the
union
always
dropped
out
of
the
talk
as
soon
as
the
theatricals
were
mentioned
when
annie
went
to
return
these
visits
she
scarcely
recognised
even
the
shape
of
the
country
once
so
familiar
to
her
of
which
the
summer
settlement
had
possessed
itself
she
found
herself
in
a
strange
world
a
world
of
colonial
and
queen
anne
architecture
where
conscious
lines
and
insistent
colours
contributed
to
an
effect
of
posing
which
she
had
never
seen
off
the
stage
but
it
was
not
a
very
large
world
and
after
the
young
trees
and
hedges
should
have
grown
up
and
helped
to
hide
it
she
felt
sure
that
it
would
be
a
better
world
in
detail
it
was
not
so
bad
now
but
the
whole
was
a
violent
effect
of
porches
gables
chimneys
galleries
loggias
balconies
and
jalousies
which
nature
had
not
yet
had
time
to
palliate
munger
was
at
home
and
wanted
her
to
spend
the
day
to
drive
out
with
her
to
stay
to
lunch
when
annie
would
not
do
any
of
these
things
she
invited
herself
to
go
with
her
to
call
at
the
brandreths
but
first
she
ordered
her
to
go
out
with
her
to
see
the
place
where
they
intended
to
have
the
theatricals
a
pretty
bit
of
natural
boscage
white
birches
pines
and
oaks
faced
by
a
stretch
of
smooth
turf
where
a
young
man
in
a
flannel
blazer
was
painting
a
in
the
grass
munger
introduced
him
as
her
jim
and
the
young
fellow
paused
from
his
work
long
enough
to
bow
to
her
his
nose
now
seemed
in
perfect
repair
brandreth
met
them
at
the
door
of
his
mother
cottage
it
was
a
very
small
cottage
on
the
outside
with
a
good
deal
of
stained
glass
in
leaded
sashes
where
the
sashes
were
not
leaded
and
the
glass
not
stained
the
panes
were
cut
up
into
very
large
ones
with
little
ones
round
them
everything
was
very
inside
the
door
opened
directly
into
a
wainscoted
square
hall
which
had
a
large
fireplace
with
gleaming
brass
andirons
and
a
carved
mantel
carried
to
the
ceiling
it
was
both
baronial
and
colonial
in
its
decoration
there
was
part
of
a
suit
of
imitation
armour
under
a
pair
of
moose
antlers
on
one
wall
and
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
there
was
a
with
a
tuft
of
flax
ready
to
be
spun
there
were
japanese
swords
on
the
lowest
together
with
fans
and
vases
a
long
old
musket
stretched
across
the
panel
above
brandreth
began
to
show
things
to
annie
and
to
tell
how
little
they
cost
as
soon
as
the
ladies
entered
his
mother
voice
called
from
above
now
percy
you
stop
till
get
there
and
in
a
moment
or
two
she
appeared
from
behind
a
in
one
corner
before
she
shook
hands
with
the
ladies
or
allowed
any
kind
of
greeting
she
pulled
the
aside
and
made
annie
admire
the
snug
concealment
of
the
staircase
then
she
made
her
go
upstairs
and
see
the
chambers
and
the
colonial
bedsteads
and
the
andirons
everywhere
and
the
old
chests
of
drawers
and
their
brasses
and
she
told
her
some
story
about
each
and
how
percy
picked
it
up
and
had
it
repaired
when
they
came
down
the
son
took
annie
in
hand
again
and
walked
her
over
the
ending
with
the
kitchen
which
was
in
the
taste
of
an
old
new
england
kitchen
with
chairs
and
a
kitchen
table
with
curiously
turned
legs
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
of
a
neighbouring
farmer
for
a
song
there
was
an
authentic
crane
in
the
fireplace
which
he
had
found
in
a
heap
of
at
a
blacksmith
shop
and
had
got
for
next
to
nothing
the
sideboard
he
had
got
at
an
old
shop
in
the
north
end
and
he
believed
it
was
an
heirloom
from
the
house
of
one
of
the
old
ministers
of
the
north
end
church
everything
nearly
in
the
brandreth
cottage
was
an
heirloom
though
annie
could
not
remember
afterward
any
object
that
had
been
an
heirloom
in
the
brandreth
family
when
she
went
back
with
brandreth
to
the
hall
which
seemed
to
be
also
the
she
found
that
brandreth
had
lighted
the
fire
on
the
hearth
though
it
was
rather
a
warm
day
without
for
the
sake
of
the
effect
she
was
sitting
in
the
and
shielding
her
face
from
the
blaze
with
an
feather
now
do
you
think
we
have
a
lovely
little
home
she
demanded
munger
began
to
break
out
in
its
praise
but
she
shook
the
screen
silencingly
at
her
no
no
i
want
miss
kilburn
unbiassed
opinion
do
you
speak
munger
now
have
we
brandreth
made
annie
assent
to
the
superiority
of
her
cottage
in
detail
she
recapitulated
the
different
facts
of
the
architecture
and
furnishing
from
each
of
which
she
seemed
to
acquire
personal
merit
and
she
insisted
that
percy
should
show
some
of
them
again
we
think
it
a
little
picture
she
concluded
and
once
more
annie
felt
obliged
to
murmur
her
acquiescence
at
last
munger
said
that
she
must
go
to
lunch
and
was
going
to
take
annie
with
her
annie
said
she
must
lunch
at
home
and
then
brandreth
pressed
them
both
to
stay
to
lunch
with
her
you
shall
have
a
cup
of
tea
out
of
a
piece
of
real
satsuma
she
said
but
they
resisted
i
believe
she
added
apparently
relieved
by
their
persistence
and
losing
a
little
anxiety
of
manner
that
percy
had
any
chance
to
consult
you
on
a
very
important
point
about
your
theatricals
miss
oh
that
will
do
some
other
time
mother
said
brandreth
no
no
now
and
you
can
have
munger
opinion
too
you
know
miss
sue
northwick
is
going
to
be
juliet
no
shouted
munger
i
thought
she
had
refused
positively
when
did
she
change
her
mind
she
just
sent
percy
a
note
we
were
talking
it
over
when
you
came
and
percy
was
going
over
to
tell
then
it
is
to
be
a
success
said
munger
with
a
solemnity
of
triumph
yes
but
percy
feels
that
it
complicates
one
point
more
than
ever
it
a
question
that
always
comes
up
in
amateur
dramatics
said
brandreth
with
reluctance
and
it
always
will
and
of
course
particularly
embarrassing
in
and
if
they
do
show
any
affection
it
very
awkward
and
stiff
and
if
i
never
approved
of
those
liberties
on
the
stage
said
brandreth
i
tell
percy
that
it
my
principal
objection
to
it
i
ca
make
it
seem
nice
but
he
says
that
it
essential
to
the
effect
now
say
that
they
might
just
incline
their
heads
toward
each
other
without
you
know
but
percy
is
afraid
that
it
wo
do
especially
in
the
parting
scene
on
the
balcony
so
passionate
you
know
it
wo
do
simply
to
they
must
like
lovers
and
it
such
a
great
point
to
get
miss
sue
northwick
to
take
the
part
that
he
must
risk
losing
her
by
anything
that
might
seem
yes
said
munger
with
deep
concern
brandreth
looked
very
unhappy
it
an
embarrassing
point
we
change
the
play
and
so
the
difficulty
must
be
met
and
disposed
of
at
he
did
not
look
at
either
of
the
ladies
but
munger
referred
the
matter
to
annie
with
a
glance
of
impartiality
his
mother
also
turned
her
eyes
upon
annie
percy
thought
that
you
must
have
seen
so
much
of
amateur
dramatics
in
europe
that
you
could
tell
him
just
how
to
perhaps
you
could
consult
miss
northwick
herself
said
annie
dryly
after
a
moment
of
indignation
and
another
of
amusement
i
thought
of
that
said
brandreth
but
as
percy
to
be
romeo
you
see
he
wishes
the
play
to
be
a
success
artistically
but
if
it
to
succeed
socially
he
must
have
miss
northwick
and
she
might
resign
at
the
first
suggestion
of
bessie
chapley
would
certainly
have
been
better
she
so
outspoken
you
could
have
put
the
case
right
to
her
said
munger
yes
said
brandreth
gloomily
but
we
shall
find
out
a
way
why
you
can
settle
it
at
rehearsal
perhaps
at
rehearsal
said
brandreth
with
a
pensive
absence
of
mind
munger
crushed
his
hand
and
his
mother
in
her
leathern
grasp
and
took
annie
away
with
her
it
is
yet
she
explained
when
they
were
out
of
earshot
but
i
saw
she
was
simply
killing
you
and
so
i
made
the
excuse
she
has
no
mercy
there
time
enough
for
you
to
make
your
calls
before
lunch
and
then
you
can
come
home
with
annie
suggested
that
this
would
not
do
after
refusing
brandreth
why
it
would
never
have
done
to
munger
cried
they
did
dream
of
it
at
the
next
place
she
said
this
is
the
clevingers
some
of
our
people
she
opened
the
door
without
ringing
and
let
herself
noisily
in
this
is
the
way
we
run
in
without
ceremony
everywhere
it
quite
one
family
that
the
charm
of
the
place
we
expect
to
take
each
other
as
we
find
her
freedom
did
not
find
the
ladies
off
their
guard
anywhere
at
all
the
houses
there
was
a
skurrying
of
feet
and
a
flashing
of
skirts
out
of
the
room
or
up
the
stairs
and
there
was
an
interval
for
a
thorough
study
of
the
features
of
the
room
before
the
hostess
came
in
with
the
effect
of
coming
in
just
as
she
was
she
had
naturally
always
made
some
change
in
her
dress
and
annie
felt
that
she
had
not
really
liked
being
run
in
upon
everywhere
they
talked
to
her
about
the
theatricals
and
they
talked
across
her
to
munger
about
one
another
pretty
freely
well
that
all
there
is
of
us
at
present
said
munger
coming
down
the
main
road
with
her
from
the
last
place
and
you
see
just
what
we
are
it
a
neighbourhood
where
everybody
just
adapted
to
everybody
else
it
not
a
mere
mush
of
concession
as
emerson
says
people
are
perfectly
outspoken
but
there
the
greatest
good
feeling
and
no
vulgar
display
or
lavish
expenditure
or
annie
walked
slowly
homeward
she
was
tired
and
she
was
now
aware
of
having
been
extremely
bored
by
the
south
hatboro
people
she
was
very
censorious
of
them
as
we
are
of
other
people
when
we
have
reason
to
be
discontented
with
ourselves
they
were
making
a
pretence
of
simplicity
and
unconventionality
but
they
had
brought
each
her
full
complement
of
servants
with
her
and
each
was
apparently
giving
herself
in
the
summer
to
the
unrealities
that
occupied
her
during
the
winter
everywhere
annie
had
found
the
affectation
of
intellectual
interests
and
the
assumption
that
these
were
the
highest
interests
of
life
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
culture
was
the
ideal
of
south
hatboro
and
several
of
the
ladies
complained
that
in
the
summer
they
got
behind
with
their
reading
or
their
art
or
their
music
they
said
it
was
even
more
trouble
to
keep
house
in
the
country
than
it
was
in
town
sometimes
your
servants
would
not
come
with
you
or
if
they
did
they
were
always
discontented
and
you
did
not
know
what
moment
they
would
leave
you
annie
asked
herself
how
her
own
life
was
in
any
wise
different
from
that
of
these
people
it
had
received
a
little
more
light
into
it
but
as
yet
it
had
not
conformed
itself
to
any
ideal
of
duty
she
too
was
idle
and
vapid
like
the
society
of
which
her
whole
past
had
made
her
a
part
and
she
owned
to
herself
groaning
in
spirit
that
it
was
no
easier
to
escape
from
her
tradition
at
hatboro
than
it
was
at
rome
when
she
reached
her
own
house
again
bolton
called
to
her
from
the
kitchen
threshold
as
she
was
passing
the
corner
on
her
way
to
the
front
door
mis
putney
here
i
guess
you
find
a
note
from
her
on
the
parlour
annie
fired
in
resentment
of
the
uncouthness
it
was
bolton
business
to
come
into
the
parlour
and
give
her
the
note
with
a
respectful
statement
of
the
facts
but
she
did
not
tell
her
so
it
would
have
been
useless
putney
note
was
an
invitation
to
a
family
tea
for
the
next
evening
xi
putney
met
annie
at
the
door
and
led
her
into
the
parlour
beside
the
hall
he
had
a
little
crippled
boy
on
his
right
arm
and
he
gave
her
his
left
hand
in
the
parlour
he
set
his
burden
down
in
a
chair
and
the
child
drew
up
under
his
thin
arms
a
pair
of
crutches
that
stood
beside
it
his
white
face
had
the
eager
purity
and
the
waxen
translucence
which
we
see
in
sufferers
from
this
is
our
winthrop
said
his
father
beginning
to
talk
at
once
we
receive
the
company
and
do
the
honours
while
mother
looking
after
the
tea
we
only
keep
one
undersized
girl
he
explained
more
directly
to
annie
and
ellen
has
to
be
chief
cook
and
bottlewasher
herself
be
in
directly
just
lay
off
your
bonnet
she
was
taking
in
the
humility
of
the
house
and
its
belongings
while
she
received
the
impression
of
an
unimagined
simplicity
in
its
life
from
his
easy
explanations
the
furniture
was
in
green
terry
the
carpet
a
harsh
brilliant
tapestry
on
the
centre
table
was
a
big
clasp
bible
and
a
basket
with
a
stereoscope
and
views
the
marbleised
iron
shelf
above
the
hole
supported
two
glass
vases
and
a
french
clock
under
a
glass
bell
through
the
open
door
across
the
of
the
hallway
she
saw
the
pine
balusters
of
the
steep
cramped
stairs
it
was
clear
that
neither
putney
nor
his
wife
had
been
touched
by
the
aesthetic
craze
the
parlour
was
in
the
tastelessness
of
fifteen
years
before
but
after
the
decoration
of
south
hatboro
she
found
a
delicious
repose
in
it
her
eyes
dwelt
with
relief
on
the
of
french
grey
sprigged
with
small
gilt
flowers
and
broken
by
a
few
cold
engravings
and
framed
photographs
putney
himself
was
as
little
decorated
as
the
parlour
he
had
put
on
a
clean
shirt
but
the
bulging
bosom
had
broken
away
from
its
single
button
and
showed
two
serrated
edges
of
ragged
linen
his
collar
lost
itself
from
time
to
time
under
the
rise
of
his
plastron
scarf
band
which
kept
escaping
from
the
stud
that
ought
to
have
held
it
down
behind
his
hair
was
brushed
smoothly
across
a
forehead
which
looked
as
innocent
and
gentle
as
the
little
boy
we
do
often
give
these
festivities
he
went
on
but
you
do
come
home
once
in
twelve
years
every
day
annie
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
in
our
house
and
ellen
just
as
excited
as
the
rest
of
us
she
was
sorry
to
miss
you
when
she
you
very
kind
ralph
i
ca
tell
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
come
and
i
not
going
to
let
the
trouble
i
giving
spoil
my
well
that
right
said
putney
he
took
out
a
cigar
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
it
only
a
dry
smoke
ellen
makes
me
let
up
on
my
chewing
when
we
have
company
and
i
must
have
something
in
my
mouth
so
i
get
a
cigar
it
a
sort
of
compromise
i
a
terribly
nervous
man
annie
you
ca
imagine
if
it
was
for
the
grace
of
god
i
think
i
should
fly
to
pieces
sometimes
but
i
guess
that
what
holds
me
together
that
and
winthy
here
i
dropped
him
on
the
stairs
out
there
when
i
was
drunk
one
night
i
saw
you
looking
at
them
i
suppose
you
been
told
it
all
right
i
presume
the
almighty
knows
what
he
about
but
sometimes
he
appears
to
save
at
the
spigot
and
waste
at
the
like
the
rest
of
us
he
let
me
cripple
my
boy
to
reform
do
ralph
said
annie
with
a
voice
of
low
entreaty
she
turned
and
spoke
to
the
child
and
asked
him
if
he
would
not
come
to
see
her
what
he
asked
breaking
with
a
sort
of
start
from
his
intentness
upon
his
father
words
she
repeated
her
invitation
thanks
he
said
in
the
prompt
clear
little
pipe
which
startles
by
its
distinctness
and
decision
on
the
lips
of
crippled
children
i
guess
father
bring
me
some
day
do
you
want
i
should
go
out
and
tell
mother
she
here
he
asked
his
father
well
if
you
want
to
winthrop
said
his
father
the
boy
swung
himself
lightly
out
of
the
room
on
his
crutches
and
his
father
turned
to
her
well
how
does
hatboro
strike
you
anyway
annie
you
need
mind
being
honest
with
me
you
he
did
not
give
her
a
chance
to
say
and
she
was
willing
to
let
him
talk
on
and
tell
her
what
he
thought
of
hatboro
himself
well
it
like
every
other
place
in
the
world
at
every
moment
of
history
it
in
a
transition
state
the
theory
is
you
know
that
most
places
are
at
a
standstill
the
greatest
part
of
the
time
they
have
begun
to
move
or
they
stopped
moving
but
i
guess
that
a
mistake
they
moving
all
the
while
i
suppose
rome
itself
was
in
a
transition
state
when
you
left
oh
very
decidedly
it
had
ceased
to
be
old
and
was
becoming
well
that
just
the
way
with
hatboro
there
is
no
old
hatboro
any
more
and
there
never
was
as
your
father
and
mine
could
tell
us
if
they
were
here
they
lived
in
a
painfully
transitional
period
poor
old
fellows
but
for
all
that
there
is
a
difference
they
lived
in
what
was
really
a
new
england
village
and
we
live
now
in
a
sprawling
american
town
and
by
american
of
course
i
mean
a
town
where
at
least
of
the
people
are
raw
foreigners
or
rawly
extracted
natives
the
old
new
england
ideal
characterises
them
all
up
to
a
certain
point
socially
it
puts
a
decent
outside
on
most
of
it
makes
keep
sunday
and
drink
on
the
sly
we
got
in
the
irish
long
ago
and
now
they
part
of
the
conservative
element
we
got
in
the
french
canadians
and
some
of
them
are
our
best
mechanics
and
citizens
we
getting
in
the
italians
and
as
soon
as
they
want
something
better
than
bread
and
vinegar
to
eat
they
begin
going
to
congress
and
boycotting
and
striking
and
forming
pools
and
trusts
just
like
any
other
class
of
americans
there
used
to
be
some
talk
of
the
chinese
but
i
guess
they
pretty
much
blown
over
we
got
ah
lee
and
sam
lung
here
just
as
they
have
everywhere
but
their
laundries
do
seem
to
increase
the
irish
are
spreading
out
into
the
country
and
scooping
in
the
farms
that
are
not
picturesque
enough
for
the
summer
folks
you
can
buy
a
farm
anywhere
round
hatboro
for
less
than
the
buildings
on
it
cost
rather
the
irish
would
have
the
land
than
the
summer
folks
they
make
an
honest
living
off
it
and
the
other
fellows
that
come
out
to
roost
here
from
june
till
october
simply
keep
somebody
else
from
making
a
living
off
it
and
corrupt
all
the
poor
people
in
sight
by
their
idleness
and
luxury
that
what
i
tell
at
south
hatboro
they
do
like
it
but
i
guess
they
believe
it
anyhow
they
have
to
hear
it
they
tell
you
in
that
milton
northwick
is
a
practical
farmer
and
sells
his
butter
for
a
dollar
a
pound
he
done
more
than
anybody
else
to
improve
the
breeds
of
cattle
and
horses
and
he
spends
fifteen
thousand
a
year
on
his
place
it
ca
return
him
five
and
that
the
reason
he
a
curse
and
a
who
northwick
ralph
annie
interposed
everybody
at
south
hatboro
asked
me
if
i
met
the
he
a
very
great
and
good
man
said
putney
he
worth
a
million
and
he
runs
a
big
manufacturing
company
at
ponkwasset
falls
and
he
owns
a
fancy
farm
just
beyond
south
hatboro
he
lives
in
boston
but
he
comes
out
here
early
enough
to
dodge
his
tax
there
and
let
poorer
people
pay
it
he
got
miles
of
cut
stone
wall
round
his
place
and
conservatories
and
gardens
and
villas
and
drives
inside
of
it
and
he
keeps
up
the
town
roads
outside
at
his
own
expense
yes
we
feel
it
such
an
honour
and
advantage
to
have
milton
in
hatboro
that
our
assessors
practically
allow
him
to
fix
the
amount
of
tax
here
himself
people
who
can
pay
only
a
little
at
the
highest
valuation
are
assessed
to
the
last
dollar
of
their
property
and
income
but
the
assessors
know
that
this
would
do
with
northwick
they
make
a
guess
at
his
income
and
he
always
pays
their
bills
without
asking
for
abatement
they
think
themselves
wise
and
men
for
doing
it
and
most
of
their
think
so
too
you
see
not
only
difficult
for
a
rich
man
to
get
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
annie
but
he
makes
it
hard
for
other
people
well
as
i
was
saying
socially
the
old
new
england
element
is
at
the
top
of
the
heap
here
that
so
everywhere
the
people
that
are
on
the
ground
first
it
do
matter
much
who
they
are
have
to
manage
pretty
badly
not
to
leave
their
descendants
in
social
ascendency
over
all
newer
comers
for
ever
why
i
can
see
it
in
my
own
case
i
can
see
that
i
was
a
sort
of
fetich
to
the
bedevilled
fancy
of
the
people
here
when
i
was
seen
drunk
in
the
streets
every
day
just
because
i
was
one
of
the
old
hatboro
putneys
and
when
i
began
to
hold
up
there
was
a
man
in
the
community
that
was
proud
and
flattered
to
help
me
curious
is
it
it
made
me
sick
of
myself
and
ashamed
of
them
and
i
just
made
up
my
mind
as
soon
as
i
got
straight
again
i
give
all
my
help
to
the
men
that
had
a
tradition
that
what
i
done
annie
there
is
any
low
friendless
rapscallion
in
this
town
that
has
got
me
for
his
friend
and
ellen
we
been
in
all
the
strikes
with
the
men
and
all
their
fool
boycottings
and
kicking
over
the
traces
generally
anybody
else
would
have
been
turned
out
of
respectable
society
for
that
i
done
but
it
tolerates
me
because
i
one
of
the
old
hatboro
putneys
you
one
of
the
old
kilburns
and
if
you
want
to
have
a
mind
of
your
own
and
a
heart
of
your
own
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
have
it
they
like
it
they
think
it
original
that
the
reason
south
hatboro
got
after
you
with
that
social
union
scheme
they
were
right
in
thinking
you
would
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
i
was
sorry
you
had
to
throw
it
against
brother
annie
felt
herself
jump
at
this
climax
as
if
she
had
been
touched
on
an
exposed
nerve
she
grew
red
and
tried
to
be
angry
but
she
was
only
ashamed
and
tempted
to
lie
out
of
the
part
she
had
taken
mrs
munger
she
said
gave
that
a
very
unfair
turn
i
did
mean
to
ridicule
peck
i
think
he
was
perfectly
sincere
the
scheme
of
the
invited
dance
and
supper
has
been
entirely
given
up
and
i
do
care
for
the
project
of
the
social
union
at
well
i
glad
to
hear
it
said
putney
indifferently
and
he
resumed
his
analysis
of
hatboro
we
got
all
the
modern
improvements
here
annie
i
suppose
find
the
modern
improvements
most
of
in
sheol
electric
light
bell
telephone
asphalt
sidewalks
and
city
water
though
i
do
know
about
the
water
and
i
presume
they
have
got
a
public
library
or
an
perhaps
they
got
an
in
sheol
you
see
i
use
the
revised
version
it
do
sound
so
much
like
swearing
but
as
i
was
saying
putney
came
in
and
he
stopped
with
the
laugh
of
a
man
who
knows
that
his
wife
will
find
it
necessary
to
account
for
him
and
apologise
for
him
the
ladies
kissed
each
other
putney
was
dressed
in
the
black
silk
of
a
woman
who
has
one
silk
she
was
red
from
the
kitchen
but
all
was
neat
and
orderly
in
the
hasty
toilet
which
she
must
have
made
since
leaving
the
a
faint
mixed
perfume
of
violet
sachet
and
fricasseed
chicken
attended
her
well
as
you
were
saying
ralph
she
suggested
oh
i
was
just
tracing
a
little
parallel
between
hatboro
and
sheol
replied
her
husband
putney
made
a
of
humorous
patience
and
laughed
toward
annie
for
sympathy
well
then
i
guess
you
need
go
on
tea
ready
shall
we
wait
for
the
doctor
no
doctors
are
too
uncertain
we
wait
for
him
while
we
eating
that
what
fetches
him
the
soonest
i
hungry
ai
you
win
not
so
very
said
the
boy
with
his
queer
promptness
he
stood
resting
himself
on
his
crutches
at
the
door
and
he
now
wheeled
about
and
led
the
way
out
to
the
swinging
himself
actively
forward
it
seemed
that
his
haste
was
to
get
to
the
in
the
little
china
closet
opening
off
the
which
was
like
the
papered
inside
of
a
square
box
he
called
to
the
girl
below
and
helped
pull
it
up
as
annie
could
tell
by
the
creaking
of
the
rope
and
the
light
jar
of
the
finally
arriving
crockery
a
girl
then
appeared
and
put
the
dishes
on
at
the
places
indicated
with
nods
and
looks
by
putney
who
had
taken
her
place
at
the
table
there
was
a
platter
of
stewed
fowl
and
a
plate
of
waffles
sweltering
in
successive
courses
of
butter
and
sugar
in
dishes
one
at
each
end
of
the
table
there
were
canned
cherries
and
there
was
a
square
of
soda
biscuit
not
broken
apart
which
sent
up
a
pleasant
smell
in
the
centre
of
the
table
was
a
shallow
vase
of
strawberries
it
was
all
very
good
and
appetising
but
to
annie
it
was
pathetically
and
helped
her
to
realise
how
wholly
out
of
the
world
was
the
life
which
her
friends
led
winthrop
said
putney
and
the
father
and
mother
bowed
their
heads
the
boy
dropped
his
over
his
folded
hands
and
piped
up
clearly
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
help
us
to
remember
those
who
have
nothing
to
eat
amen
that
a
grace
that
win
got
up
himself
his
father
explained
beginning
to
heap
a
plate
with
chicken
and
mashed
potato
which
he
then
handed
to
annie
passing
her
the
biscuit
and
the
butter
we
think
it
suits
the
almighty
about
as
well
as
i
suppose
you
know
ralph
of
old
annie
said
putney
the
only
way
he
keeps
within
bounds
at
all
is
by
letting
himself
perfectly
putney
laughed
out
his
acquiescence
and
they
began
to
talk
together
about
old
times
putney
and
annie
recalled
the
childish
plays
and
adventures
they
had
together
and
one
dreadful
quarrel
putney
told
of
the
first
time
he
saw
annie
when
his
father
took
him
one
day
for
a
call
on
the
old
judge
and
how
the
old
judge
put
him
through
his
paces
in
american
history
and
would
not
admit
the
theory
that
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
could
have
been
fought
on
breed
hill
putney
said
that
it
was
years
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
judge
must
have
been
joking
he
had
always
thought
he
was
simply
ignorant
i
used
to
set
a
good
deal
by
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
he
continued
i
thought
the
whole
revolution
and
subsequent
history
revolved
round
it
and
that
it
gave
us
all
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
at
a
clip
but
the
lord
always
finds
some
odd
jobs
to
look
after
next
day
and
i
guess
he
did
clear
all
up
at
bunker
putney
irony
and
piety
were
very
much
of
a
piece
apparently
and
annie
was
not
quite
sure
which
this
conclusion
was
she
glanced
at
his
wife
who
seemed
satisfied
with
it
in
either
case
she
was
waiting
patiently
for
him
to
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
he
had
not
yet
given
her
anything
to
eat
after
helping
annie
and
the
boy
he
helped
himself
and
pending
his
with
the
tea
he
forgot
her
why
did
you
throw
something
at
me
he
roared
in
grief
and
there
would
have
been
a
loose
piece
of
crockery
on
this
side
of
the
table
if
i
had
got
my
tea
in
oh
i
was
listening
to
annie
share
in
the
conversation
said
putney
and
her
husband
was
about
to
say
something
in
retort
of
her
thrust
when
a
tap
on
the
front
door
was
heard
come
in
come
in
doc
he
shouted
mrs
putney
just
been
helped
and
the
tea
is
going
to
morrell
chuckle
made
answer
for
him
and
after
time
enough
to
put
down
his
hat
he
came
in
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
and
making
short
nods
round
the
table
how
d
do
putney
how
d
do
miss
kilburn
winthrop
he
passed
his
hand
over
the
boy
smooth
hair
and
slipped
into
the
chair
beside
him
you
see
the
reason
why
we
always
wait
for
the
doctor
in
this
formal
way
said
putney
is
that
he
is
in
here
more
than
seven
nights
of
the
week
and
he
rather
stands
on
his
dignity
hand
round
the
doctor
plate
my
son
he
added
to
the
boy
and
he
took
it
from
annie
to
whom
the
boy
gave
it
and
began
to
heap
it
from
the
various
dishes
think
you
can
lift
that
much
back
to
the
doctor
win
i
guess
so
said
the
boy
coolly
what
is
flooring
win
at
present
said
his
father
and
getting
him
down
and
rolling
him
over
is
that
problem
of
the
robin
that
eats
half
a
pint
of
grasshoppers
and
then
does
weigh
a
bit
more
than
he
did
when
he
gets
a
little
older
said
the
doctor
shaking
over
his
plateful
he
be
interested
to
trace
the
processes
of
his
father
thought
from
a
guest
and
half
a
peck
of
stewed
chicken
to
a
robin
and
half
a
pint
of
do
doctor
pleaded
putney
he
wo
have
the
least
trouble
if
he
keep
to
the
putney
laughed
impartially
and
said
well
we
take
the
doctor
out
and
weigh
him
when
he
gets
done
we
expected
brother
peck
here
this
evening
he
explained
to
morrell
you
our
sober
second
thought
well
he
broke
off
looking
across
the
table
at
his
wife
with
mock
anxiety
anything
wrong
about
that
ellen
not
as
far
as
i
concerned
putney
interposed
the
doctor
glad
to
be
here
on
any
terms
go
on
oh
there
is
anything
more
you
know
how
miss
kilburn
here
has
been
round
throwing
ridicule
on
brother
peck
because
he
wants
the
treated
with
common
decency
and
my
idea
was
to
get
the
two
together
and
see
how
she
would
morrell
laughed
at
this
with
what
annie
thought
was
unnecessary
malice
but
he
stopped
suddenly
after
a
glance
at
her
and
putney
went
on
brother
peck
pleaded
another
engagement
said
he
had
to
go
off
into
the
country
to
see
a
sick
woman
that
was
expected
to
live
you
remember
the
merrifields
do
you
annie
well
it
does
matter
one
of
married
west
and
her
husband
left
her
and
she
came
home
here
and
got
a
divorce
i
got
it
for
her
she
the
one
as
a
consumptive
she
had
superior
attractions
for
brother
peck
it
is
a
case
that
admits
of
jealousy
exactly
but
it
would
matter
to
brother
peck
anyway
if
he
saw
a
chance
to
do
a
good
action
he
wade
through
now
look
here
ralph
said
putney
there
such
a
thing
as
letting
yourself
well
then
said
putney
buttering
himself
a
biscuit
the
boy
who
had
kept
quiet
till
now
seemed
reached
by
this
last
touch
and
broke
into
a
high
crowing
laugh
in
which
they
all
joined
except
his
father
gore
suits
winthy
anyway
he
said
beginning
to
eat
his
biscuit
i
met
one
of
the
deacons
from
brother
peck
last
parish
in
boston
yesterday
he
asked
me
if
we
considered
brother
peck
anyways
peculiar
in
hatboro
and
when
i
said
we
thought
he
was
a
little
too
luxurious
the
deacon
came
out
with
a
lot
of
things
the
way
brother
peck
behaved
toward
the
needy
in
that
last
parish
of
his
made
it
simply
uninhabitable
to
the
standard
christian
they
had
to
get
rid
of
him
somehow
send
him
away
or
kill
him
of
course
the
deacon
said
they
did
want
to
where
was
his
last
parish
asked
the
doctor
down
on
the
maine
coast
somewhere
penobscotport
i
and
was
he
indigenous
there
no
i
believe
not
he
from
massachusetts
and
then
i
understand
to
an
education
divinity
student
with
summer
intervals
of
waiting
at
table
in
the
mountain
hotels
probably
drifted
down
maine
way
on
his
first
call
and
stuck
but
i
guess
he
wo
stick
here
very
long
annie
friend
gerrish
is
going
to
look
after
brother
peck
before
a
great
he
laughed
to
see
her
blush
and
went
on
you
see
brother
gerrish
has
got
a
high
ideal
of
what
a
christian
minister
ought
to
be
he
has
said
much
about
it
but
i
can
see
that
brother
peck
come
up
to
it
well
brother
gerrish
has
got
a
good
many
ideals
he
likes
to
get
anybody
he
can
by
the
throat
and
squeeze
the
difference
of
opinion
out
of
there
now
ralph
his
wife
interposed
you
let
gerrish
alone
do
like
people
to
differ
with
you
either
is
your
cup
out
doctor
thank
you
said
the
doctor
handing
it
up
to
her
and
you
mean
gerrish
does
like
peck
doctrine
he
asked
of
putney
oh
i
do
know
that
he
objects
to
his
doctrine
he
ca
very
well
the
leds
of
the
bible
as
the
baptist
said
but
he
objects
to
brother
peck
walk
and
conversation
he
thinks
he
walks
too
much
with
the
poor
and
converses
too
much
with
the
lowly
he
says
he
thinks
that
the
in
peck
church
and
the
people
who
pay
his
salary
have
some
rights
to
his
company
that
he
bound
to
the
doctor
relished
the
irony
but
he
asked
is
there
something
to
say
on
that
side
oh
yes
a
good
deal
there
always
something
to
say
on
both
sides
even
when
one
a
wrong
side
that
what
makes
it
all
so
tiresome
makes
you
wish
you
were
he
looked
up
and
caught
his
boy
eye
fixed
with
melancholy
intensity
upon
him
i
hope
you
never
look
at
both
sides
when
you
grow
up
win
it
mighty
uncomfortable
you
take
the
right
side
and
stick
to
that
brother
gerrish
he
resumed
to
the
doctor
goes
round
taking
the
credit
of
brother
peck
call
here
but
the
fact
is
he
opposed
it
he
did
like
his
being
so
indifferent
about
the
salary
brother
gerrish
held
that
the
labourer
was
worthy
of
his
hire
and
if
he
inquire
what
his
wages
were
going
to
be
it
was
a
pretty
good
sign
that
he
was
going
to
earn
well
there
was
some
logic
in
that
said
the
doctor
smiling
as
before
plenty
and
now
it
worries
brother
gerrish
to
see
brother
peck
going
round
in
the
same
old
suit
of
clothes
he
came
here
in
and
dressing
his
child
like
a
shabby
little
irish
girl
he
says
that
he
who
provideth
not
for
those
of
his
own
household
is
worse
than
a
heathen
that
perfectly
true
and
he
would
like
to
know
what
brother
peck
does
with
his
money
anyway
he
would
like
to
insinuate
that
he
loses
it
at
poker
i
guess
at
any
rate
he
ca
find
out
whom
he
gives
it
to
and
he
certainly
does
spend
it
on
from
your
account
of
said
the
doctor
i
should
think
brother
gerrish
might
safely
object
to
him
as
a
certain
kind
of
well
yes
he
might
looking
at
him
from
the
outside
but
when
you
come
to
talk
with
brother
peck
you
find
yourself
sort
of
frozen
out
with
a
most
unexpected
brother
peck
is
plain
itself
he
seems
to
be
a
man
without
an
illusion
without
an
oh
not
so
bad
as
that
laughed
the
doctor
ask
miss
kilburn
she
talked
with
him
and
she
hates
no
i
do
ralph
annie
began
oh
well
then
perhaps
he
only
made
you
hate
yourself
said
putney
there
was
something
charming
in
his
mockery
like
the
teasing
of
a
brother
with
a
sister
and
annie
did
not
find
the
atonement
to
which
he
brought
her
altogether
painful
it
seemed
to
her
really
that
she
was
getting
off
pretty
easily
and
she
laughed
with
hearty
consent
at
last
winthrop
asked
solemnly
how
did
he
do
that
oh
i
ca
tell
exactly
winthrop
she
said
touched
by
the
boy
simple
interest
in
this
abstruse
point
he
made
me
feel
that
i
had
been
rather
mean
and
cruel
when
i
thought
i
had
only
been
practical
i
ca
explain
but
it
was
a
comfortable
feeling
my
i
guess
that
the
trouble
with
brother
peck
said
putney
he
make
you
feel
comfortable
he
does
flatter
you
up
worth
a
cent
there
was
annie
expecting
him
to
take
the
most
fervent
interest
in
her
theatricals
and
her
social
union
and
coo
round
and
tell
her
what
a
noble
woman
she
was
and
beg
her
to
consider
her
health
and
not
overwork
herself
in
doing
good
but
instead
of
that
he
simply
showed
her
that
she
was
a
moral
and
that
she
was
living
in
a
stone
age
of
social
brutalities
and
of
course
she
hated
yes
that
was
the
way
winthrop
said
annie
and
they
all
laughed
with
her
now
you
take
them
into
the
parlour
ralph
said
his
wife
rising
and
tell
them
how
he
made
hate
i
should
like
anything
better
replied
putney
he
lifted
the
large
ugly
kerosene
lamp
that
had
been
set
on
the
table
when
it
grew
dark
during
tea
and
carried
it
into
the
parlour
with
him
his
wife
remained
to
speak
with
her
little
helper
but
she
sent
annie
with
the
gentlemen
why
there
is
a
great
deal
of
it
more
spirit
than
letter
so
to
speak
said
putney
when
he
put
down
the
lamp
in
the
parlour
you
know
how
i
like
to
go
on
about
other
people
sins
and
the
world
wickedness
generally
but
one
day
brother
peck
in
that
cool
impersonal
way
of
his
suggested
that
it
was
not
a
wholly
meritorious
thing
to
hate
evil
he
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
perhaps
we
could
not
love
them
that
despitefully
used
us
if
we
hated
their
evil
so
furiously
he
said
it
was
a
good
deal
more
desirable
to
understand
evil
than
to
hate
it
for
then
we
could
begin
to
cure
it
yes
brother
peck
let
in
a
good
deal
of
light
on
me
he
rather
insinuated
that
i
must
be
possessed
by
the
very
evils
i
hated
and
that
was
the
reason
i
was
so
violent
about
them
i
had
always
supposed
that
i
hated
other
people
cruelty
because
i
was
merciful
and
their
meanness
because
i
was
magnanimous
and
their
intolerance
because
i
was
generous
and
their
conceit
because
i
was
modest
and
their
selfishness
because
i
was
disinterested
but
after
listening
to
brother
peck
a
while
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
hated
these
things
in
others
because
i
was
cruel
myself
and
mean
and
bigoted
and
conceited
and
piggish
and
that
why
hated
brother
peck
ever
since
just
like
you
annie
but
he
did
reform
me
i
thankful
to
say
any
more
than
he
did
you
i
gone
on
just
the
same
and
i
suppose
i
hate
more
infernal
scoundrels
and
loathe
more
infernal
idiots
than
ever
but
i
perceive
that
i
no
part
of
the
power
that
makes
for
righteousness
as
long
as
i
work
that
racket
and
now
i
sin
with
light
and
knowledge
anyway
no
annie
he
went
on
i
can
understand
why
brother
peck
is
not
the
success
with
women
and
feminine
temperaments
like
me
that
his
virtues
entitle
him
to
be
what
we
feminine
temperaments
want
is
a
prophet
and
brother
peck
does
prophesy
worth
a
cent
he
does
pretend
to
be
authorised
in
any
sort
of
way
he
has
a
sneaking
style
of
being
no
better
than
you
are
and
of
being
rather
stumped
by
some
of
the
truths
he
finds
out
no
women
like
a
good
prophet
about
as
well
as
they
do
a
good
doctor
now
if
you
if
you
could
unite
the
two
functions
doc
sort
of
suggested
morrell
exactly
the
aborigines
understood
the
thing
why
i
suppose
that
a
real
live
could
go
through
a
community
like
this
and
not
leave
a
sinful
soul
nor
a
sore
body
in
it
among
the
ladies
perfect
faith
but
what
did
you
say
to
peck
ralph
asked
annie
did
you
attempt
any
defence
no
said
putney
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
you
ca
talk
back
at
a
man
in
the
oh
it
was
a
sermon
i
suppose
the
other
people
thought
so
but
i
knew
it
was
a
private
conversation
that
he
was
publicly
holding
with
putney
and
the
doctor
began
to
talk
of
the
nature
and
origin
of
evil
and
annie
and
the
boy
listened
putney
took
high
ground
and
attributed
it
to
adam
you
know
annie
he
explained
i
do
believe
this
but
i
like
to
get
a
scientific
man
that
wo
quite
deny
scripture
or
the
good
old
bible
premises
and
see
him
suffer
hello
you
up
yet
winthrop
i
guess
i
go
through
the
form
of
carrying
you
to
bed
my
when
putney
rejoined
them
annie
said
she
must
go
and
putney
went
upstairs
with
her
apparently
to
help
her
put
on
her
things
but
really
to
have
that
talk
before
parting
which
guest
and
hostess
value
above
the
whole
evening
pleasure
she
showed
annie
the
pictures
of
the
little
girls
that
had
died
and
talked
a
great
deal
about
their
sickness
and
their
loveliness
in
death
then
they
spoke
of
others
and
putney
asked
annie
if
she
had
seen
lyra
wilmington
lately
annie
told
of
her
call
with
munger
and
putney
said
i
lyra
and
i
always
did
i
presume
she
is
very
happily
married
he
too
old
there
could
have
been
any
love
on
her
part
but
she
would
be
a
better
woman
than
she
is
if
she
had
children
ralph
says
added
putney
smiling
that
he
knows
she
would
be
a
good
mother
she
such
a
good
annie
put
her
two
hands
impressively
on
the
hands
of
her
friend
folded
at
her
waist
ellen
what
it
mean
nothing
more
than
what
you
saw
annie
she
must
have
or
she
have
some
one
to
amuse
her
to
be
at
her
beck
and
call
and
it
best
to
have
it
all
in
the
family
ralph
but
is
it
does
he
think
it
odd
it
makes
they
moved
a
little
toward
the
door
holding
each
other
hands
ellen
i
had
a
time
and
so
have
i
annie
i
thought
you
like
to
meet
oh
yes
indeed
and
i
ca
tell
you
what
a
night
this
has
been
for
ralph
he
likes
you
so
much
and
it
is
often
that
he
has
a
chance
to
talk
to
two
such
people
as
you
and
how
brilliant
he
is
annie
sighed
yes
he
a
very
able
man
it
very
fortunate
for
hatboro
to
have
such
a
doctor
he
and
ralph
are
great
cronies
i
never
feel
uneasy
now
when
ralph
out
late
i
know
he
been
up
at
the
doctor
office
talking
i
annie
broke
in
with
a
laugh
i
no
doubt
morrell
is
all
you
say
ellen
but
i
meant
ralph
when
i
spoke
of
brilliancy
he
has
a
great
future
i
putney
was
silent
for
a
moment
i
satisfied
with
the
present
so
long
as
ralph
the
tears
suddenly
gushed
out
of
her
eyes
and
ran
down
over
the
fine
wrinkles
of
her
plump
little
cheeks
not
quite
so
much
loud
talking
please
piped
a
thin
high
voice
from
a
room
across
the
stairs
landing
why
dear
little
soul
cried
annie
i
forgot
he
gone
to
would
you
like
to
see
him
asked
his
mother
she
led
the
way
into
the
room
where
the
boy
lay
in
a
low
bed
near
a
larger
one
his
crutches
lay
beside
it
win
sleeps
in
our
room
yet
he
can
take
care
of
himself
quite
well
but
when
he
wakes
in
the
night
he
likes
to
reach
out
and
touch
his
father
the
child
looked
mortified
i
wish
i
could
reach
out
and
touch
father
hand
when
i
wake
in
the
night
said
annie
the
cloud
left
the
boy
face
i
ca
remember
whether
i
said
my
prayers
mother
i
been
thinking
well
say
them
over
again
to
the
men
voices
sounded
in
the
hall
below
and
the
ladies
found
them
there
morrell
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
look
here
annie
said
putney
expected
to
walk
home
with
you
but
doc
morrell
says
he
going
to
cut
me
out
it
looks
like
a
job
i
do
know
whether
you
in
it
or
not
but
there
no
doubt
about
putney
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
and
then
they
all
shouted
with
laughter
and
annie
and
the
doctor
went
out
into
the
night
in
the
imperfect
light
which
the
electrics
of
the
main
street
flung
afar
into
the
little
avenue
where
putney
lived
and
the
moon
sent
through
the
sidewalk
trees
they
struck
against
each
other
as
they
walked
and
the
doctor
said
had
you
better
take
my
arm
miss
kilburn
till
we
get
used
to
the
dark
yes
i
think
i
had
decidedly
she
answered
and
she
hurried
to
add
dr
morrell
there
is
something
i
want
to
ask
you
you
their
physician
are
you
the
putneys
well
then
you
can
tell
me
oh
no
i
ca
if
you
ask
me
as
their
physician
he
interrupted
well
then
as
their
friend
putney
said
something
to
me
that
makes
me
very
unhappy
i
thought
putney
was
out
of
all
danger
of
his
trouble
has
he
perfectly
reformed
does
he
ever
she
stopped
and
morrell
did
not
answer
at
once
then
he
said
seriously
it
a
continual
fight
with
a
man
of
putney
temperament
and
sometimes
he
gets
beaten
yes
i
guess
you
better
know
poor
ellen
they
do
allow
themselves
to
be
discouraged
as
soon
as
he
on
his
feet
they
begin
the
fight
again
but
of
course
it
prevents
his
success
in
his
profession
and
he
always
be
a
country
poor
ralph
and
so
brilliant
as
he
is
he
could
be
we
must
be
glad
if
he
can
be
something
as
it
yes
and
how
happy
they
seem
together
all
three
of
them
that
child
worships
his
father
and
how
tender
ralph
is
of
him
how
good
he
is
to
his
wife
and
how
proud
she
is
of
him
and
that
awful
shadow
over
them
all
the
time
i
do
see
how
they
live
the
doctor
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
finally
said
they
have
the
peace
that
seems
to
come
to
people
from
the
presence
of
a
common
peril
and
they
have
the
comfort
of
people
who
never
blink
the
i
think
ralph
is
terrible
i
wish
he
let
other
people
blink
the
facts
a
of
course
said
the
doctor
it
become
a
habit
with
him
now
or
a
mania
he
seems
to
speak
of
his
trouble
as
if
mentioning
it
were
a
sort
of
conjuration
to
prevent
it
i
would
venture
to
check
him
in
his
way
of
talking
he
may
find
strength
in
it
all
terrible
but
it
is
by
any
means
i
so
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
you
see
a
great
deal
of
them
i
believe
yes
said
the
doctor
getting
back
from
their
seriousness
with
apparent
relief
pretty
nearly
every
day
putney
and
i
consider
the
ways
of
god
to
man
a
good
deal
together
you
can
imagine
that
in
a
place
like
hatboro
one
would
make
the
most
of
such
a
friend
in
fact
yes
of
course
annie
assented
dr
morrell
she
added
in
that
effect
of
continuing
the
subject
with
which
one
breaks
away
from
it
do
you
know
much
about
south
hatboro
i
have
some
patients
i
was
there
this
morning
i
heard
of
you
they
all
take
a
great
interest
in
your
in
theatricals
really
this
is
too
much
who
has
made
them
my
theatricals
i
should
like
to
know
everybody
at
south
hatboro
talked
as
if
i
had
got
them
and
have
you
no
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
brandreth
spoke
to
me
about
them
a
week
ago
and
i
was
foolish
enough
to
go
round
with
munger
to
collect
public
opinion
about
her
invited
dance
and
supper
and
now
it
appears
that
i
have
invented
the
whole
i
certainly
got
that
impression
said
the
doctor
with
a
laugh
lurking
under
his
gravity
well
it
simply
atrocious
said
annie
i
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
either
i
do
even
know
that
i
approve
of
their
their
object
yes
the
social
oh
oh
yes
i
had
forgot
about
the
object
and
now
the
doctor
laughed
outright
it
seems
to
have
dropped
into
the
background
with
everybody
said
annie
laughing
too
you
like
the
unconventionality
of
south
hatboro
suggested
the
doctor
after
a
little
silence
oh
very
much
said
annie
i
was
used
to
the
same
thing
abroad
it
might
be
an
american
colony
anywhere
on
the
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
musingly
that
the
same
conditions
of
sojourn
and
disoccupation
produce
the
same
social
effects
anywhere
then
you
must
feel
quite
at
home
in
south
hatboro
quite
it
what
i
came
back
to
avoid
i
was
sick
of
the
life
over
there
and
i
wanted
to
be
of
some
use
here
instead
of
wasting
all
my
she
stopped
resolved
not
to
go
on
if
he
took
this
lightly
but
the
doctor
answered
her
with
sufficient
gravity
well
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
could
be
of
any
use
in
the
world
anywhere
i
could
in
the
place
where
i
was
born
and
where
my
whole
childhood
was
spent
i
been
at
home
a
month
now
the
most
useless
person
in
hatboro
i
did
catch
at
the
first
thing
that
offered
at
brandreth
and
his
ridiculous
social
union
and
theatricals
and
brought
all
this
trouble
on
myself
i
talked
to
peck
about
them
you
know
what
his
views
are
only
from
putney
talk
said
the
doctor
he
did
merely
disapprove
of
the
dance
and
supper
but
he
had
some
very
peculiar
notions
about
the
relations
of
the
different
classes
in
general
said
annie
and
this
was
the
point
she
had
meant
circuitously
to
lead
up
to
when
she
began
to
speak
of
south
hatboro
though
she
theoretically
despised
all
sorts
of
feminine
indirectness
yes
said
the
doctor
what
notions
well
he
thinks
that
if
you
have
money
you
do
good
with
that
rather
odd
said
morrell
i
do
state
it
quite
fairly
he
meant
that
you
ca
make
any
kindness
with
it
between
yourself
and
the
the
that
odd
yes
said
annie
anxiously
you
can
impose
an
obligation
he
says
but
you
ca
create
sympathy
of
course
ralph
exaggerates
what
i
said
about
him
in
connection
with
the
invited
dance
and
supper
though
i
do
justify
what
i
did
say
and
if
i
known
then
as
i
do
now
what
his
history
had
been
i
should
have
been
more
careful
in
my
talk
with
him
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
have
hurt
his
feelings
and
i
suppose
people
who
come
up
in
that
way
are
sensitive
she
suggested
this
and
it
was
not
the
reassurance
she
was
seeking
to
have
morrell
say
she
continued
with
an
effort
i
afraid
i
did
respect
his
sincerity
and
i
ought
to
have
done
that
though
i
do
at
all
agree
with
him
on
the
other
points
it
seems
to
me
that
what
he
said
was
shocking
and
perfectly
why
what
was
it
asked
the
doctor
he
said
there
could
be
no
real
kindness
between
the
rich
and
poor
because
all
their
experiences
of
life
were
different
it
amounted
to
saying
that
there
ought
not
to
any
wealth
do
you
think
so
really
i
never
thought
about
it
returned
morrell
after
a
moment
he
asked
is
it
rather
an
abstraction
do
say
that
said
annie
nervously
it
the
concrete
thing
in
the
world
the
doctor
laughed
with
enjoyment
of
her
convulsive
emphasis
but
she
went
on
i
do
think
life
worth
living
if
you
to
be
shut
up
all
your
days
to
the
intelligence
merely
of
your
own
who
said
you
were
mr
and
what
was
your
inference
from
the
fact
that
there
ought
to
be
any
classes
of
course
it
wo
do
to
say
that
there
be
social
differences
do
you
think
so
i
do
know
said
morrell
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
light
before
it
a
very
curious
he
asked
brightening
gaily
after
a
moment
of
sober
pause
is
that
the
whole
trouble
is
it
enough
no
i
do
think
it
is
why
did
you
tell
him
that
you
did
want
any
gratitude
not
any
she
demanded
oh
said
morrell
i
did
know
but
you
thought
it
was
enough
to
annie
believed
that
he
was
making
fun
of
her
and
she
tried
to
make
her
resentful
silence
dignified
but
she
only
answered
sadly
no
it
enough
for
me
besides
he
made
me
see
that
you
ca
give
sympathy
where
you
ca
receive
well
that
bad
said
the
doctor
and
he
laughed
again
excuse
me
he
added
i
see
the
point
but
why
do
you
forget
it
forget
it
yes
if
you
ca
help
it
why
need
you
worry
about
it
she
gave
a
kind
of
gasp
of
astonishment
do
you
really
think
that
would
be
right
she
edged
a
little
away
from
morrell
as
if
with
distrust
well
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
he
returned
thoughtfully
without
seeming
to
have
noticed
her
withdrawal
i
do
suppose
i
was
looking
at
the
moral
side
it
rather
out
of
my
way
to
do
that
if
a
physician
let
himself
get
into
the
habit
of
doing
that
he
might
regard
of
the
diseases
he
has
to
treat
as
just
penalties
and
decline
to
she
fancied
that
he
was
amused
again
rather
than
deeply
concerned
and
she
determined
to
make
him
own
his
personal
complicity
in
the
matter
if
she
could
then
you
feel
sympathy
with
your
patients
you
find
it
necessary
to
do
so
the
doctor
thought
a
moment
i
take
an
interest
in
their
but
you
want
them
to
get
well
oh
certainly
i
bound
to
do
all
i
can
for
them
as
a
nothing
more
yes
i
sorry
for
them
for
their
families
if
it
seems
to
be
going
badly
with
and
and
as
as
do
you
care
at
all
for
your
work
as
a
part
of
what
every
one
ought
to
do
for
others
as
humanity
philan
she
stopped
the
offensive
word
well
i
ca
say
that
i
looked
at
it
in
that
light
exactly
he
answered
i
suspect
i
not
very
good
at
generalising
my
own
relations
to
others
though
i
like
well
enough
to
speculate
in
the
abstract
but
you
think
peck
has
overlooked
one
important
fact
in
his
theory
what
about
the
people
who
have
grown
rich
from
being
poor
as
most
americans
have
they
have
the
same
experiences
and
why
ca
they
sympathise
with
those
who
have
remained
poor
i
never
thought
of
that
why
did
i
ask
him
that
she
lamented
so
sincerely
that
the
doctor
laughed
again
i
think
that
peck
oh
no
oh
no
said
the
doctor
in
an
entreating
coaxing
tone
expressive
of
a
satiety
with
the
subject
that
he
might
very
well
have
felt
and
he
ended
with
another
laugh
in
which
after
a
moment
of
indignant
she
joined
him
is
that
delicious
he
exclaimed
and
she
involuntarily
slowed
her
pace
with
his
the
spicy
scent
of
blossoms
hung
in
the
dewy
air
that
wrapped
one
of
the
darkened
village
houses
from
a
syringa
bush
before
another
as
they
moved
on
a
denser
perfume
stole
out
with
the
wild
song
of
a
hidden
in
it
the
music
and
the
odour
seemed
braided
together
the
shadows
of
the
trees
cast
by
the
electrics
on
the
walks
were
so
thick
and
black
that
they
looked
palpable
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
stoop
down
and
lift
them
from
the
ground
a
broad
bath
of
moonlight
washed
one
of
the
house
fronts
and
the
clapboards
looked
wet
with
it
they
talked
of
these
things
of
themselves
and
of
their
own
traits
and
peculiarities
and
at
her
door
they
ended
far
from
peck
and
all
the
perplexities
he
had
suggested
she
had
told
morrell
of
some
things
she
had
brought
home
with
her
and
had
said
she
hoped
he
would
find
time
to
come
and
see
them
it
would
have
been
stiff
not
to
do
it
and
she
believed
she
had
done
it
in
a
very
way
but
she
continued
to
question
whether
she
had
xii
miss
northwick
called
upon
annie
during
the
week
with
excuses
for
her
delay
and
for
coming
alone
she
seemed
to
have
intentions
of
being
polite
but
she
constantly
betrayed
her
want
of
interest
in
annie
and
disappointed
an
expectation
of
refinement
which
her
physical
delicacy
awakened
she
asked
her
how
she
ever
came
to
take
up
the
social
union
and
answered
for
her
that
of
course
it
had
the
attraction
of
the
theatricals
and
went
on
to
talk
of
her
sister
part
in
them
the
relation
of
the
northwick
family
to
the
coming
entertainment
and
an
impression
of
frail
mottled
wrists
and
high
thin
cheeks
and
an
absence
of
modelling
under
affluent
drapery
was
the
main
effect
of
miss
northwick
visit
when
annie
returned
it
she
met
the
younger
sister
whom
she
found
a
great
beauty
she
seemed
very
cold
and
of
a
which
she
subdued
with
difficulty
but
she
was
more
consecutively
polite
than
her
sister
and
annie
watched
with
fascination
her
turns
of
the
head
her
movements
of
leopard
swiftness
and
elasticity
the
changing
lights
of
her
complexion
the
curves
of
her
fine
lips
the
fluttering
of
her
thin
nostrils
a
very
new
basket
phaeton
stood
glittering
at
annie
door
when
she
got
home
and
wilmington
put
her
head
out
of
the
open
parlour
window
how
d
do
annie
she
drawled
in
her
tender
voice
wo
you
come
in
you
see
i
in
possession
i
just
got
my
new
phaeton
and
i
drove
up
at
once
to
crush
you
with
it
is
it
a
beauty
you
too
late
lyra
said
annie
i
just
come
from
the
northwicks
and
another
crushing
beauty
has
got
in
ahead
of
your
oh
annie
lyra
began
to
laugh
with
agreeable
intelligence
come
in
and
tell
me
about
it
why
is
that
girl
going
to
take
part
in
the
theatricals
she
does
care
to
please
any
one
does
she
i
did
know
that
people
took
part
in
theatricals
for
that
annie
i
thought
they
wanted
to
please
themselves
and
mortify
others
do
but
then
i
may
be
different
perhaps
miss
northwick
wants
to
please
do
you
mean
it
lyra
demanded
annie
arrested
on
her
threshold
by
the
charm
of
this
improbability
well
i
do
know
they
opposites
but
upon
second
thoughts
you
need
come
in
annie
i
want
you
to
take
a
drive
with
me
and
try
my
new
phaeton
said
lyra
coming
out
annie
now
looked
at
it
with
that
irresolution
of
hers
and
lyra
commanded
get
right
in
we
go
down
to
the
works
you
never
met
my
husband
yet
have
you
annie
no
i
have
lyra
i
always
just
missed
him
somehow
he
seems
to
have
been
perpetually
just
gone
to
town
or
not
got
well
he
really
at
home
now
and
i
do
mean
at
the
house
which
home
to
him
but
the
works
you
never
seen
the
works
either
have
you
no
i
well
then
we
just
go
round
there
and
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
i
ought
to
show
off
my
new
phaeton
to
wilmington
first
of
all
he
gave
it
to
me
it
would
be
kind
of
conjugal
or
filial
or
something
you
know
wilmington
and
i
are
not
exactly
contemporaries
annie
i
heard
he
was
somewhat
your
senior
said
annie
reluctantly
lyra
laughed
well
i
always
say
we
were
born
in
the
same
century
they
came
round
into
the
region
of
the
shops
and
lyra
checked
her
pony
in
front
of
her
husband
factory
it
was
not
imposingly
large
but
as
wilmington
caused
annie
to
observe
it
was
as
big
as
the
hat
shops
and
as
ugly
as
the
shoe
shops
the
structure
trembled
with
the
operation
of
its
industry
and
as
they
mounted
the
wooden
steps
to
the
open
outside
door
an
inner
door
swung
ajar
for
a
moment
and
let
out
a
roar
mingled
of
the
hum
and
whirl
and
clash
of
machinery
and
fragments
of
voice
borne
to
them
on
a
whiff
of
warm
greasy
air
of
course
it
does
smell
very
nice
said
lyra
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
office
and
finding
its
first
apartment
empty
led
the
way
with
annie
to
the
inner
room
where
her
husband
sat
writing
at
a
table
george
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
miss
oh
yes
yes
yes
said
her
husband
scrambling
to
his
feet
and
coming
round
to
greet
annie
he
was
a
small
man
very
bald
with
a
serious
and
wrinkled
forehead
and
rather
austere
brows
but
his
mouth
had
a
furtive
curl
at
one
corner
which
with
the
habit
he
had
of
touching
it
there
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
made
annie
think
of
a
cat
that
had
been
at
the
cream
i
been
hoping
to
call
with
wilmington
to
pay
my
respects
but
i
been
away
a
great
deal
this
season
and
and
we
all
very
happy
to
have
you
home
again
miss
kilburn
i
often
heard
my
wife
speak
of
your
old
days
together
at
they
fenced
with
some
polite
feints
of
interest
in
each
other
the
old
man
standing
beside
his
and
staying
himself
with
a
shaking
hand
upon
it
lyra
interrupted
them
well
i
think
now
that
annie
is
here
we
better
not
let
her
get
away
without
showing
her
the
oh
oh
decidedly
i
go
with
you
with
great
pleasure
ah
he
bustled
about
putting
the
things
together
on
his
table
and
then
reaching
for
the
panama
hat
on
a
hook
behind
it
there
was
something
pathetic
in
his
eagerness
to
do
what
lyra
bade
him
and
annie
fancied
in
him
the
uneasy
consciousness
which
an
elderly
husband
might
feel
in
the
presence
of
those
who
met
him
for
the
first
time
with
his
young
wife
at
the
outer
office
door
they
encountered
jack
wilmington
i
show
them
through
he
said
to
his
uncle
and
the
old
man
assented
with
well
perhaps
you
better
jack
and
went
back
to
his
room
the
wilmington
spun
their
own
threads
and
the
first
room
was
like
what
annie
had
seen
before
in
cotton
factories
with
a
faint
smell
of
oil
from
the
machinery
and
a
fine
snow
of
fluff
in
the
air
and
catching
to
the
walls
and
the
foul
window
sashes
the
tireless
machines
marched
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
and
the
men
who
watched
them
with
suicidal
intensity
ran
after
them
barefooted
when
they
made
off
with
a
broken
thread
spliced
it
and
then
escaped
from
them
to
their
stations
again
in
other
rooms
where
there
was
a
stunning
whir
of
spindles
girls
and
women
were
at
work
they
looked
after
lyra
and
her
nephew
from
under
bangs
they
all
seemed
to
know
her
and
returned
her
easy
kindly
greetings
with
an
effect
of
liking
from
time
to
time
at
lyra
bidding
the
young
fellow
explained
to
annie
some
curious
feature
of
the
processes
in
the
room
where
the
stockings
were
knitted
she
tried
to
understand
the
machinery
that
wrought
and
seemed
to
live
before
her
eyes
but
her
mind
wandered
to
the
men
and
women
who
were
operating
it
and
who
seemed
no
more
a
voluntary
part
of
it
than
all
the
rest
except
when
jack
wilmington
curtly
ordered
them
to
do
this
or
that
in
illustration
of
some
point
he
was
explaining
she
wearied
herself
as
people
do
in
such
places
in
expressing
her
wonder
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
machinery
it
was
a
relief
to
get
away
from
it
all
into
the
room
cool
and
quiet
where
half
a
dozen
neat
girls
were
counting
and
stamping
the
stockings
with
different
numbers
here
where
used
to
work
said
lyra
and
where
i
first
met
wilmington
the
place
is
of
romantic
associations
the
stockings
are
all
one
annie
but
people
like
to
wear
different
numbers
and
so
we
try
to
gratify
them
which
number
do
wear
or
do
you
wear
the
wilmington
do
well
they
not
exactly
annie
when
all
said
and
done
for
when
they
left
the
mill
she
asked
annie
to
come
home
to
tea
with
her
saying
as
if
from
a
perception
of
her
dislike
for
the
young
fellow
that
jack
was
going
to
boston
they
had
a
long
evening
together
after
wilmington
took
himself
off
after
tea
to
his
study
as
he
called
it
and
remained
shut
in
there
annie
was
uneasily
aware
of
him
from
time
to
time
but
lyra
had
apparently
no
more
disturbance
from
his
absence
than
from
his
presence
which
she
had
managed
with
a
frank
acceptance
of
everything
it
suggested
she
talked
freely
of
her
marriage
not
as
if
it
were
like
others
but
for
what
it
was
she
showed
annie
over
the
house
and
she
ended
with
a
display
of
the
rich
dresses
which
he
was
always
buying
her
and
which
she
never
wore
because
she
never
went
anywhere
annie
said
she
thought
she
would
at
least
like
to
go
to
the
seaside
somewhere
during
the
summer
but
no
lyra
said
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
and
you
know
annie
i
always
did
hate
i
want
the
care
of
a
cottage
and
i
do
want
to
be
poked
into
a
hotel
so
i
stay
in
she
said
that
she
had
always
been
a
village
girl
and
did
not
miss
the
interests
of
a
larger
life
as
she
caught
glimpses
of
them
in
south
hatboro
or
want
the
bother
of
them
she
said
she
studied
music
a
little
and
confessed
that
she
read
a
good
deal
novels
mostly
though
the
library
was
handsomely
equipped
with
general
literature
at
moments
it
all
seemed
no
harm
at
others
the
luxury
in
which
this
life
was
so
contentedly
sunk
oppressed
annie
like
a
thick
close
air
yet
she
knew
that
lyra
was
kind
to
many
of
the
poor
people
about
her
and
did
a
great
deal
of
good
as
the
phrase
is
with
the
superfluity
which
it
involved
no
to
give
from
but
peck
had
given
her
a
point
of
view
and
though
she
believed
she
did
not
agree
with
him
she
could
not
escape
from
it
lyra
told
her
much
about
people
in
hatboro
and
characterised
them
all
so
humorously
and
she
seemed
so
in
her
ridicule
which
spared
nobody
she
shrieked
with
laughter
about
brandreth
when
annie
told
her
of
his
mother
doubt
whether
his
with
miss
northwick
ought
to
be
tacit
or
explicit
in
the
kissing
and
embracing
between
romeo
and
juliet
do
you
think
annie
we
better
refer
him
to
peck
i
like
to
hear
brandreth
and
mr
peek
discussing
it
i
must
tell
jack
about
it
i
might
get
him
to
ask
sue
northwick
and
get
her
has
wilmington
known
the
northwicks
long
annie
asked
he
used
to
go
to
their
boston
house
when
he
was
at
oh
then
said
annie
perhaps
accounts
for
her
playing
juliet
though
as
tybalt
i
do
see
exactly
how
he
oh
it
at
the
rehearsals
you
know
that
the
fun
is
and
then
it
matter
what
part
you
annie
lay
awake
a
long
time
that
night
she
was
sure
that
she
ought
not
to
like
lyra
if
she
did
not
approve
of
her
and
that
she
ought
not
to
have
gone
home
to
tea
with
her
and
spent
the
evening
with
her
unless
she
fully
respected
her
but
she
had
to
own
to
herself
that
she
did
like
her
and
enjoyed
hearing
her
soft
drawl
she
tried
to
think
how
jack
having
gone
to
boston
for
the
evening
made
it
somehow
less
censurable
for
her
to
spend
it
with
lyra
even
if
she
did
not
approve
of
her
as
she
drowsed
this
became
perfectly
clear
xiii
in
the
process
of
that
expansion
from
a
new
england
village
to
an
american
town
of
which
putney
spoke
hatboro
had
suffered
one
kind
of
deterioration
which
annie
could
not
help
noticing
she
remembered
a
distinctly
intellectual
life
which
might
still
exist
in
its
elements
but
which
certainly
no
longer
had
as
definite
expression
there
used
to
be
houses
in
which
people
maiden
aunts
and
hale
grandmothers
took
a
keen
interest
in
literature
and
read
the
new
books
and
discussed
them
some
time
after
they
had
ceased
to
be
new
in
the
publishing
centres
but
whilst
they
were
still
not
old
but
now
the
grandmothers
had
died
out
and
the
maiden
aunts
had
faded
in
and
she
could
not
find
just
such
houses
anywhere
in
hatboro
the
decay
of
the
unitarians
as
a
sect
perhaps
had
something
to
do
with
the
literary
lapse
of
the
place
their
highly
intellectualised
belief
had
favoured
taste
in
a
direction
where
the
more
ritualistic
and
emotional
religions
did
not
promote
it
and
it
is
certain
that
they
were
no
longer
the
leading
people
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
just
who
these
leading
people
were
the
old
political
and
juristic
which
the
lawyers
had
once
enjoyed
was
a
tradition
the
learned
professions
yielded
in
distinction
to
the
growing
wealth
and
plutocratic
influence
of
the
prosperous
manufacturers
the
situation
might
be
summed
up
in
the
fact
that
colonel
marvin
of
the
shoe
interest
and
wilmington
now
filled
the
place
once
held
by
judge
kilburn
and
squire
putney
the
social
life
in
private
houses
had
undoubtedly
shrunk
but
it
had
expanded
in
the
direction
of
church
sociables
and
it
had
become
much
more
ecclesiastical
in
every
way
without
becoming
more
religious
as
formerly
some
people
were
acceptable
and
some
were
not
but
it
was
as
everywhere
else
more
a
question
of
money
there
was
an
aristocracy
and
a
commonalty
but
there
was
a
confusion
and
a
more
ready
convertibility
in
the
materials
of
each
the
social
authority
of
such
a
person
as
gerrish
was
not
the
only
change
that
bewildered
annie
and
the
effort
to
extend
her
relations
with
the
village
people
was
one
from
which
she
shrank
till
her
consciousness
had
more
perfectly
adjusted
itself
to
the
new
conditions
meanwhile
morrell
came
to
call
the
night
after
their
tea
at
the
putneys
and
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
coming
several
nights
in
the
week
and
staying
late
sometimes
he
was
sent
for
at
her
house
by
sick
people
and
he
must
have
left
word
at
his
office
where
he
was
to
be
found
he
had
spent
part
of
his
student
life
in
europe
and
he
looked
back
to
his
travel
there
with
a
fondness
that
the
old
world
inspires
less
and
less
in
americans
this
with
his
derivation
from
one
of
the
unliterary
boston
suburbs
and
his
unambitious
residence
in
a
place
like
hatboro
gave
her
a
sense
of
provinciality
in
him
on
his
part
he
apparently
found
it
droll
that
a
woman
of
her
acquaintance
with
a
larger
life
should
be
willing
to
live
in
hatboro
at
all
and
he
seemed
incredulous
about
her
staying
after
summer
was
over
she
felt
that
she
mystified
him
and
sometimes
she
felt
the
pursuit
of
a
curiosity
which
was
a
little
too
like
a
psychical
diagnosis
he
had
a
way
of
sitting
beside
her
table
and
playing
with
her
while
he
submitted
with
a
quizzical
smile
to
her
endeavours
to
turn
him
to
account
she
did
not
mind
his
laughing
at
her
eagerness
a
woman
is
willing
enough
to
join
a
man
in
making
fun
of
her
femininity
if
she
believes
that
he
respects
her
and
she
tried
to
make
him
talk
about
hatboro
and
tell
her
how
she
could
be
of
use
among
the
working
people
she
would
have
liked
very
much
to
know
whether
he
gave
his
medical
service
gratis
among
them
and
whether
he
found
it
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
to
do
so
there
was
one
moment
when
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
him
to
let
her
be
at
the
charges
of
his
more
indigent
patients
but
with
the
words
behind
her
lips
she
perceived
that
it
would
not
do
at
the
best
it
would
be
taking
his
opportunity
from
him
and
making
it
hers
she
began
to
see
that
one
ought
to
have
a
conscience
about
doing
good
she
let
the
chance
of
proposing
this
impossibility
go
by
and
after
a
little
silence
morrell
seemed
to
revert
in
her
interest
to
the
economical
situation
in
hatboro
you
know
that
most
of
the
hands
in
the
are
from
the
farms
around
and
some
of
them
own
property
here
in
the
village
i
know
the
owner
of
three
small
houses
who
always
worked
in
the
shops
you
could
very
well
offer
help
to
a
landed
proprietor
like
that
no
said
annie
abashed
in
view
of
him
i
suppose
you
ought
to
go
to
a
factory
town
like
fall
river
if
you
really
wanted
to
deal
with
overwork
and
i
beginning
to
think
there
no
such
thing
anywhere
she
said
desperately
the
doctor
eyes
twinkled
sympathetically
i
do
know
whether
benson
earned
his
three
houses
altogether
in
the
he
a
good
horse
as
he
says
and
he
likes
to
trade
it
for
a
better
i
know
that
from
experience
but
he
a
great
friend
of
mine
well
then
there
are
more
women
than
men
in
the
shops
and
they
earn
more
i
suppose
that
rather
disappointing
it
is
but
on
the
other
hand
the
work
only
lasts
eight
months
of
the
year
and
that
cuts
wages
down
to
an
average
of
a
dollar
a
ah
cried
annie
there
some
hope
in
what
do
they
do
when
the
work
stops
oh
they
go
back
to
their
all
perhaps
not
i
so
well
you
better
look
round
among
those
that
even
among
these
she
looked
in
vain
for
destitution
she
could
find
that
in
satisfactory
degree
only
in
straggling
veterans
of
the
great
army
of
tramps
which
once
overran
country
places
in
the
summer
she
would
have
preferred
not
to
see
or
know
the
objects
of
her
charity
and
because
she
preferred
this
she
forced
herself
to
face
their
distasteful
misery
bolton
had
orders
to
send
no
one
from
the
door
who
asked
for
food
or
work
but
to
call
annie
and
let
her
judge
the
case
she
knew
that
it
was
folly
and
she
was
afraid
it
was
worse
but
she
could
not
send
the
homeless
creatures
away
as
hungry
or
poor
as
they
came
they
filled
her
gentlewoman
soul
with
loathing
but
if
she
kept
beyond
the
range
of
the
powerful
corporeal
odour
that
enveloped
them
she
could
experience
the
luxury
of
pity
for
them
the
filthy
rags
that
caricatured
them
their
sick
or
sodden
faces
always
frowsed
with
a
week
beard
represented
typical
poverty
to
her
and
accused
her
comfortable
state
with
a
poignant
contrast
and
she
consoled
herself
as
far
as
she
could
with
the
superstition
that
in
meeting
them
she
was
fulfilling
a
duty
sacred
in
proportion
to
the
disgust
she
felt
in
the
encounter
the
work
at
the
fell
off
after
the
spring
orders
and
did
not
revive
till
the
beginning
of
august
if
there
was
less
money
among
the
hands
and
their
families
who
remained
than
there
was
in
time
of
full
work
the
weather
made
less
demand
upon
their
resources
the
children
lived
mostly
and
seemed
to
have
always
what
they
wanted
of
the
season
fruit
and
vegetables
they
got
these
too
late
from
the
decaying
lots
at
the
provision
stores
and
too
early
from
the
nearest
orchards
and
morrell
admitted
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
sickness
especially
among
the
little
ones
from
this
diet
annie
wondered
whether
she
ought
not
to
offer
herself
as
a
nurse
among
them
she
asked
him
whether
she
could
not
be
of
use
in
that
way
and
had
to
confess
that
she
knew
nothing
about
the
prevailing
disease
then
i
do
think
you
better
undertake
it
he
said
there
are
too
many
nurses
there
already
such
as
they
are
it
the
dull
time
in
most
of
the
shops
you
know
and
the
women
have
plenty
of
leisure
there
are
about
five
volunteer
nurses
for
every
patient
not
counting
the
grandmothers
on
both
sides
i
think
they
would
resent
any
outside
ah
i
always
on
the
outside
but
ca
i
send
i
mean
carry
them
anything
nourishing
any
little
dishes
arrowroot
is
about
all
the
convalescents
can
she
made
a
note
of
it
but
jelly
and
chicken
broth
are
always
relished
by
their
dr
morrell
i
must
ask
you
not
to
turn
me
into
ridicule
if
you
please
i
can
not
permit
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
indeed
miss
kilburn
i
did
mean
to
ridicule
you
i
began
seriously
but
i
was
led
astray
by
remembering
what
becomes
of
most
of
the
good
things
sent
to
sick
i
know
she
said
breaking
into
a
laugh
i
have
eaten
lots
of
them
for
my
father
and
is
arrowroot
the
only
thing
the
doctor
reflected
gravely
why
no
there
a
poor
little
life
now
and
then
that
might
be
saved
by
the
yes
if
you
care
to
send
some
of
my
patients
with
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
apiece
to
the
seaside
do
say
another
word
doctor
cried
annie
you
make
me
happy
i
will
i
will
send
their
whole
families
and
you
wo
you
let
a
case
escape
will
you
doctor
it
was
a
break
in
the
iron
wall
of
uselessness
which
had
closed
her
in
she
behaved
like
a
young
girl
with
an
invitation
to
a
ball
when
the
first
patient
came
back
well
from
the
seaside
her
rejoicing
overflowed
in
exultation
before
the
friends
to
whom
she
confessed
her
agency
in
the
affair
putney
pretended
that
he
could
not
see
what
pleasure
she
could
reasonably
take
in
restoring
the
child
to
the
sort
of
life
it
had
been
born
to
but
that
was
a
matter
she
would
not
consider
theoretically
or
practically
she
began
to
go
outside
of
morrell
authority
she
looked
up
two
cases
herself
and
upon
advising
with
their
grandmothers
sent
them
to
the
seaside
and
she
was
at
the
station
when
the
train
came
in
with
the
young
mother
and
the
still
younger
aunt
of
one
of
the
sick
children
she
did
not
see
the
baby
and
the
mother
passed
her
with
a
stare
of
impassioned
reproach
and
fell
sobbing
on
the
neck
of
her
husband
waiting
for
her
on
the
platform
annie
felt
the
blood
drop
back
upon
her
heart
she
caught
at
the
girlish
aunt
who
was
looking
about
her
with
a
sense
of
the
interest
which
attached
to
herself
as
a
party
to
the
spectacle
oh
rebecca
where
is
the
child
well
there
miss
kilburn
i
sorry
to
tell
you
but
i
guess
the
did
do
it
a
great
deal
of
good
if
any
i
tell
maria
see
it
in
the
right
light
after
a
while
but
of
course
she
ca
first
off
well
there
got
to
look
after
it
you
excuse
miss
annie
saw
her
run
off
to
the
from
which
the
was
handing
out
a
narrow
box
the
ground
reeled
under
her
feet
she
got
the
public
depot
carriage
and
drove
home
she
sent
for
morrell
and
poured
out
the
confession
of
her
error
upon
him
before
he
could
speak
i
am
a
murderess
she
ended
hysterically
do
deny
it
i
think
you
can
be
got
off
on
the
ground
of
insanity
miss
kilburn
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
he
answered
her
desperation
broke
in
tears
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
killed
the
child
oh
no
you
have
he
retorted
i
know
the
case
the
only
hope
for
it
was
the
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
send
it
she
took
down
her
handkerchief
and
gave
him
a
piercing
look
dr
morrell
if
you
are
lying
to
me
i
not
lying
miss
kilburn
he
answered
you
done
a
very
unwarrantable
thing
in
both
of
the
cases
that
you
sent
to
the
seaside
on
your
own
responsibility
one
of
them
i
certainly
should
have
advised
sending
but
it
turned
out
well
you
no
more
credit
for
it
though
than
for
this
that
died
and
you
wo
think
i
lying
perhaps
when
i
say
you
equally
to
blame
in
both
i
i
beg
your
pardon
she
faltered
with
dawning
comfort
in
his
severity
i
did
mean
i
did
intend
to
say
i
know
it
said
morrell
allowing
himself
to
smile
just
remember
that
you
blundered
into
doing
the
only
thing
left
to
be
done
for
savor
child
and
do
try
it
again
that
he
smiled
once
more
and
at
some
permissive
light
in
her
face
he
began
even
to
laugh
you
you
horrible
oh
no
i
not
he
gasped
all
the
tears
in
the
world
would
help
and
my
laughing
hurts
nobody
i
sorry
for
you
and
i
sorry
for
the
mother
but
i
told
you
the
truth
i
have
indeed
and
you
believe
the
child
father
came
to
see
her
the
next
night
rebecca
she
seemed
to
think
that
you
felt
kind
of
bad
may
be
because
maria
would
speak
to
you
when
she
first
got
off
the
cars
yesterday
and
i
do
say
she
done
exactly
right
myself
the
way
i
look
at
it
and
the
way
i
tell
maria
ought
to
is
like
this
you
done
what
you
done
for
the
best
and
we
to
take
your
advice
anyway
but
of
course
maria
she
kind
of
set
her
heart
on
savin
it
and
she
ca
seem
to
get
over
it
right
he
talked
on
much
longer
to
the
same
effect
tilted
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
down
while
he
covered
and
uncovered
one
of
his
knees
with
his
straw
hat
he
had
the
usual
rustic
difficulty
in
getting
away
but
annie
was
glad
to
keep
him
in
her
gratitude
for
his
kindness
besides
she
could
not
let
him
go
without
satisfying
a
suspicion
she
had
and
morrell
have
you
seen
him
for
savor
have
you
she
stopped
for
shame
of
her
hypocrisy
no
we
hai
seen
him
i
guess
she
get
it
needed
this
stroke
to
complete
her
humiliation
before
the
fellow
i
i
suppose
she
stammered
out
that
you
your
wife
would
like
me
to
come
to
the
i
can
understand
that
but
oh
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
for
you
flowers
or
my
carriage
or
helping
anyway
savor
stood
up
i
much
obliged
to
miss
kilburn
but
we
thought
we
had
better
wait
well
not
a
great
while
and
the
funeral
was
this
afternoon
well
i
wish
you
good
she
met
the
mother
a
few
days
after
in
the
street
with
an
impulse
to
cross
over
to
the
other
side
she
advanced
straight
upon
her
mrs
savor
what
can
i
say
to
you
oh
i
do
presume
but
what
you
meant
for
the
best
miss
kilburn
but
i
guess
i
shall
know
what
to
do
next
time
i
kind
of
felt
the
whole
while
that
it
was
a
resk
but
it
all
right
annie
realised
in
her
resentment
of
the
poor
thing
uncouth
sorrow
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
with
the
hope
of
getting
not
giving
comfort
yes
yes
she
confessed
i
was
to
the
bereaved
mother
did
not
gainsay
her
and
she
felt
that
whatever
was
the
justice
of
the
case
she
had
met
her
present
deserts
she
had
to
bear
the
discredit
into
which
the
seaside
fell
with
the
mothers
of
all
the
other
sick
children
she
tried
to
bring
morrell
once
to
the
consideration
of
her
culpability
in
the
case
of
those
who
might
have
lived
if
the
case
of
savor
baby
had
not
frightened
their
mothers
from
sending
them
to
the
seaside
but
he
refused
to
grapple
with
the
problem
she
was
obliged
to
believe
him
when
he
said
he
should
not
have
advised
sending
any
of
the
recent
cases
there
that
the
disease
was
changing
its
character
and
such
a
course
could
have
done
no
good
look
here
miss
kilburn
he
said
after
scanning
her
face
sharply
going
to
leave
you
a
little
tonic
i
think
you
rather
run
well
she
said
passively
xiv
it
was
in
her
revulsion
from
the
direct
beneficence
which
had
proved
so
dangerous
that
annie
was
able
to
give
herself
to
the
more
general
interests
of
the
social
union
she
had
not
the
courage
to
test
her
influence
for
it
among
the
workpeople
whom
it
was
to
entertain
and
elevate
and
whose
peck
had
thought
important
but
she
went
about
among
the
other
classes
and
found
a
degree
of
favour
and
deference
which
surprised
her
and
an
ignorance
of
what
lay
so
heavy
on
her
heart
which
was
still
more
comforting
she
was
nowhere
treated
as
the
guilty
wretch
she
called
herself
some
who
knew
of
the
facts
had
got
them
wrong
and
she
discovered
what
must
always
astonish
the
inquirer
below
the
pretentious
surface
of
our
democracy
an
indifference
and
an
incredulity
concerning
the
feelings
of
people
of
lower
station
which
could
not
be
surpassed
in
another
civilisation
her
concern
for
savor
was
treated
as
a
great
trial
for
miss
kilburn
but
the
mother
bereavement
was
regarded
as
something
those
people
were
used
to
and
got
over
more
easily
than
one
could
imagine
annie
mission
took
her
to
the
ministers
of
the
various
denominations
and
she
was
able
to
overcome
any
scruples
they
might
have
about
the
theatricals
by
urging
the
excellence
of
their
object
as
a
unitarian
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
liberality
with
which
the
matter
was
considered
the
episcopalians
of
course
were
with
her
but
the
universalist
minister
himself
was
not
more
friendly
than
the
young
methodist
preacher
who
volunteered
to
call
with
her
on
the
pastor
of
the
baptist
church
and
help
present
the
affair
in
the
right
light
she
had
expected
a
degree
of
of
bigotry
which
her
sect
learned
to
attribute
to
others
in
the
militant
period
before
they
had
imbibed
so
much
of
its
own
tolerance
but
the
recollection
of
what
had
passed
with
peck
remained
a
reproach
in
her
mind
and
nothing
that
she
accomplished
for
the
social
union
with
the
other
ministers
was
important
in
her
vivid
reveries
she
often
met
him
and
combated
his
peculiar
ideas
while
she
admitted
a
wrong
in
her
own
position
and
made
every
expression
of
regret
and
parted
from
him
on
the
best
terms
esteemed
and
complimented
in
high
degree
in
reality
she
saw
him
seldom
and
still
more
rarely
spoke
to
him
and
then
with
a
distance
and
consciousness
altogether
different
from
the
effects
dramatised
in
her
fancy
sometimes
during
the
period
of
her
interest
in
the
sick
children
of
the
hands
she
saw
him
in
their
houses
or
coming
and
going
outside
but
she
had
no
chance
to
speak
with
him
or
else
said
to
herself
that
she
had
none
because
she
was
ashamed
before
him
she
thought
he
avoided
her
but
this
was
probably
only
a
phase
of
the
impersonality
which
seemed
characteristic
of
him
in
everything
at
these
times
she
felt
a
strange
pathos
in
the
lonely
man
whom
she
knew
to
be
at
odds
with
many
of
his
own
people
and
she
longed
to
interpret
herself
more
sympathetically
to
him
but
actually
confronted
with
him
she
was
sensible
of
something
cold
and
even
hard
in
the
nimbus
her
compassion
cast
about
him
yet
even
this
added
to
the
mystery
that
piqued
her
and
that
loosed
her
fancy
to
play
as
soon
as
they
parted
in
conjecture
about
his
past
life
his
marriage
and
the
mad
wife
who
had
left
him
with
the
child
he
seemed
so
to
care
for
then
the
next
time
they
met
she
was
abashed
with
the
recollection
of
having
unwarrantably
romanced
the
plain
simple
homely
little
man
and
she
added
an
embarrassment
of
her
own
to
that
shyness
of
his
which
kept
them
apart
except
for
what
she
had
heard
putney
say
and
what
she
learned
casually
from
the
people
themselves
she
could
not
have
believed
he
ever
did
anything
for
them
he
came
and
went
so
elusively
as
far
as
annie
was
concerned
that
she
knew
of
his
presence
in
the
houses
of
sickness
and
death
usually
by
his
little
girl
whom
she
found
playing
about
in
the
street
before
the
door
with
the
children
of
the
hands
she
seemed
to
hold
her
own
among
the
others
in
their
plays
and
their
squabbles
if
she
tried
to
make
up
to
her
idella
smiled
but
she
would
not
be
approached
and
annie
heart
went
out
to
the
little
mischief
in
as
helpless
goodwill
as
toward
the
minister
himself
she
used
to
hear
his
voice
through
the
windows
when
he
called
upon
the
boltons
and
wondered
if
some
accident
would
not
bring
them
together
but
she
had
to
send
for
bolton
at
last
and
bid
her
tell
peck
that
she
would
like
to
see
him
before
he
went
away
one
night
he
came
and
then
she
began
a
parrying
parley
of
preliminary
nothings
before
she
could
say
that
she
supposed
he
knew
the
ladies
were
going
on
with
their
scheme
for
the
establishment
of
the
social
union
he
admitted
vaguely
that
he
had
heard
something
to
that
effect
and
she
added
that
the
invited
dance
and
supper
had
been
given
up
he
remained
apparently
indifferent
to
the
fact
and
she
hurried
on
and
i
ought
to
say
peck
that
nearly
every
one
every
one
whose
opinion
you
would
value
agreed
with
you
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
and
and
shocking
and
i
quite
ashamed
that
i
should
not
have
seen
it
from
the
beginning
and
i
hope
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
said
things
in
my
my
excitement
that
must
have
i
mean
not
only
what
i
said
to
you
but
what
i
said
to
others
and
i
assure
you
that
i
regret
them
and
she
went
on
and
repeated
herself
at
length
and
he
listened
patiently
but
as
if
the
matter
had
not
really
concerned
either
of
them
personally
she
had
to
conclude
that
what
she
had
said
of
him
had
not
reached
him
and
she
ended
by
confessing
that
she
had
clung
to
the
social
union
project
because
it
seemed
the
only
thing
in
which
her
attempts
to
do
good
were
not
mischievous
peck
thin
face
kindled
with
a
friendlier
interest
than
it
had
shown
while
the
question
at
all
related
to
himself
and
a
light
of
something
that
she
took
for
humorous
compassion
came
into
his
large
pale
blue
eyes
at
least
it
was
intelligence
and
perhaps
the
woman
nature
craves
this
as
much
as
it
is
supposed
to
crave
sympathy
perhaps
the
two
are
finally
one
i
want
to
tell
you
something
peck
an
experience
of
mine
she
said
abruptly
and
without
trying
to
connect
it
obviously
with
what
had
gone
before
she
told
him
the
story
of
her
beneficence
to
the
savors
he
listened
intently
and
at
the
end
he
said
i
understand
but
that
is
sorrow
you
have
caused
not
evil
and
what
we
intend
in
goodwill
must
not
rest
a
burden
on
the
conscience
no
matter
how
it
turns
out
otherwise
the
moral
world
is
no
better
than
a
crazy
dream
without
plan
or
sequence
you
might
as
well
rejoice
in
an
evil
deed
because
good
happened
to
come
of
oh
i
you
she
gasped
you
do
know
what
a
load
you
have
lifted
from
me
her
words
feebly
expressed
the
sense
of
deliverance
which
overflowed
her
heart
her
strength
failed
her
like
that
of
a
person
suddenly
relieved
from
some
great
physical
stress
or
peril
but
she
felt
that
he
had
given
her
the
truth
and
she
held
fast
by
it
while
she
went
on
if
you
knew
or
if
any
one
knew
how
difficult
it
is
what
a
responsibility
to
do
the
least
thing
for
others
and
once
it
seemed
so
simple
and
it
seems
all
the
more
difficult
the
more
means
you
have
for
doing
good
the
poor
people
seem
to
help
one
another
without
doing
any
harm
but
if
try
it
yes
said
the
minister
it
is
difficult
to
help
others
when
we
cease
to
need
help
ourselves
a
man
begins
poor
or
his
father
or
grandfather
before
him
it
does
matter
how
far
back
he
begins
and
then
he
is
in
accord
and
full
understanding
with
all
the
other
poor
in
the
world
but
as
he
prospers
he
withdraws
from
them
and
loses
their
point
of
view
then
when
he
offers
help
it
is
not
as
a
brother
of
those
who
need
it
but
a
patron
an
agent
of
the
false
state
of
things
in
which
want
is
possible
and
his
help
is
not
an
impulse
of
the
love
that
ought
to
bind
us
all
together
but
a
compromise
proposed
by
iniquitous
social
conditions
a
to
his
own
guilty
consciousness
of
his
share
in
the
yes
said
annie
too
grateful
for
the
comfort
he
had
given
her
to
question
words
whose
full
purport
had
not
perhaps
reached
her
and
i
assure
you
peck
i
feel
very
differently
about
these
things
since
i
first
talked
with
you
and
i
wish
to
tell
you
in
justice
to
myself
that
i
had
no
idea
then
that
that
you
were
speaking
from
your
own
experience
when
you
you
said
how
working
people
looked
at
things
i
did
know
that
you
had
been
that
is
that
yes
said
the
minister
coming
to
her
relief
i
once
worked
in
a
then
he
continued
dismissing
the
personal
concern
it
seems
to
me
that
i
saw
things
in
their
right
light
as
i
have
never
been
able
to
see
them
since
and
how
brutal
she
broke
in
how
cruel
and
vulgar
what
i
said
must
have
seemed
to
you
i
fancied
he
continued
evasively
that
i
had
authority
to
set
myself
apart
from
my
to
be
a
teacher
and
guide
to
the
true
life
but
it
was
a
great
error
the
true
life
was
the
life
of
work
and
no
one
ever
had
authority
to
turn
from
it
christ
himself
came
as
a
labouring
that
is
true
said
annie
and
his
words
transfigured
the
man
who
spoke
them
so
that
her
heart
turned
reverently
toward
him
but
if
you
had
been
meant
to
work
in
a
mill
all
your
life
she
pursued
would
you
have
been
given
the
powers
you
have
and
that
you
have
just
used
to
save
me
from
despair
the
minister
rose
and
said
with
a
sigh
no
one
was
meant
to
work
in
a
mill
all
his
life
good
she
would
have
liked
to
keep
him
longer
but
she
could
not
think
how
at
once
as
he
turned
to
go
out
through
the
boltons
part
of
the
house
wo
you
go
out
through
my
door
she
asked
with
a
helpless
effort
at
hospitality
oh
if
you
wish
he
answered
submissively
when
she
had
closed
the
door
upon
him
she
went
to
speak
with
bolton
she
was
in
the
kitchen
mixing
flour
to
make
bread
and
annie
traced
her
by
following
the
through
the
open
door
it
discovered
bolton
sitting
in
the
outer
doorway
his
back
against
one
jamb
and
his
resting
against
the
base
of
the
other
mrs
bolton
annie
began
at
once
making
herself
free
of
one
of
the
hard
kitchen
chairs
how
is
peck
getting
on
in
hatboro
i
as
i
know
just
what
you
mean
miss
kilburn
said
bolton
on
the
defensive
i
mean
is
there
a
party
against
him
in
his
church
is
he
unpopular
bolton
took
some
flour
and
sprinkled
it
on
her
then
she
lifted
the
mass
of
dough
out
of
the
trough
before
her
and
let
it
sink
softly
upon
the
board
i
as
you
can
say
he
unpoplah
he
ai
poplah
with
some
yes
there
a
party
the
gerrish
is
it
a
strong
one
it
pretty
do
you
think
it
will
prevail
well
most
o
folks
do
know
they
want
and
if
there
some
folks
that
know
what
they
want
they
can
generally
keep
from
havin
bolton
made
a
soft
husky
prefatory
noise
of
protest
in
his
throat
which
seemed
to
stimulate
his
wife
to
a
more
definite
assertion
and
she
cut
in
before
he
could
speak
should
say
that
unless
them
that
stood
peck
friends
first
off
and
got
him
here
done
something
to
keep
him
his
enemies
to
take
up
his
annie
divined
a
personal
reproach
for
bolton
in
the
apparent
abstraction
oh
now
you
see
it
all
come
out
right
in
the
end
pauliny
he
mildly
opposed
there
ai
any
such
great
feelin
about
peck
but
what
work
itself
off
natural
give
it
time
it
goin
to
come
out
all
yes
at
the
day
o
jedgment
bolton
assented
plunging
her
fists
into
the
dough
and
beginning
to
work
a
contempt
for
her
husband
optimism
into
it
yes
an
a
good
deal
before
he
returned
there
always
somethin
to
objec
to
every
minister
we
ai
any
of
us
perfect
and
peck
got
his
failin
he
hai
built
up
the
church
quite
so
much
as
some
on
expected
but
what
he
would
and
there
some
that
do
like
his
prayers
and
some
of
thinks
he
ai
doctrinal
enough
but
i
guess
take
it
all
round
he
suits
pretty
well
it
come
out
all
right
pauliny
a
pause
ensued
of
which
annie
felt
the
awfulness
it
seemed
to
her
that
bolton
impatience
with
this
intolerable
hopefulness
must
burst
violently
she
hastened
to
interpose
i
think
the
trouble
is
that
people
do
fully
understand
peck
at
first
but
they
do
yes
take
time
said
bolton
take
eternity
i
guess
for
some
retorted
his
wife
if
you
think
william
gerrish
is
goin
to
work
round
with
time
she
stopped
for
want
of
some
sufficiently
rejectional
phrase
and
did
not
go
on
the
way
i
look
at
it
said
bolton
with
incorrigible
courage
is
like
this
when
it
comes
to
anything
like
askin
peck
to
resign
develop
his
strength
you
ca
tell
how
strong
he
is
without
you
try
to
git
red
of
him
i
wish
it
would
come
once
fair
and
i
sure
you
right
bolton
said
annie
i
do
believe
that
your
church
would
let
such
a
man
go
when
it
really
came
to
it
do
they
all
feel
that
he
has
great
ability
oh
i
guess
they
appreciate
him
as
far
forth
as
ability
goes
some
on
complains
that
he
a
little
intellectial
if
anything
but
i
tell
it
a
good
fault
it
a
thing
that
can
be
got
over
in
bolton
had
ceased
to
take
part
in
the
discussion
she
finished
kneading
her
dough
and
having
fitted
it
into
two
and
dusted
it
with
flour
she
laid
a
clean
towel
over
both
but
when
annie
rose
she
took
the
lamp
from
the
where
it
stood
and
held
it
up
for
her
to
find
her
way
back
to
her
own
door
annie
went
to
bed
with
a
spirit
lightened
as
well
as
chastened
and
kept
saying
over
the
words
of
peck
so
as
to
keep
fast
hold
of
the
consolation
they
had
given
her
they
humbled
her
with
a
sense
of
his
wisdom
and
insight
the
thought
of
them
kept
her
awake
she
remembered
the
tonic
that
morrell
had
left
with
her
and
after
questioning
whether
she
really
needed
it
now
she
made
sure
by
getting
up
and
taking
it
xv
the
spring
had
filled
and
flushed
into
summer
bolton
had
gone
over
the
grass
on
the
slope
before
the
house
and
it
was
growing
thick
again
dark
green
above
the
yellow
of
its
stubble
and
the
young
generation
of
robins
was
foraging
in
it
for
the
callow
grasshoppers
some
boughs
of
the
maples
were
beginning
to
lose
the
elastic
upward
lift
of
their
prime
and
to
hang
looser
and
limper
with
the
burden
of
their
foliage
the
elms
drooped
lower
toward
the
grass
and
swept
the
straggling
tops
left
standing
in
their
shade
the
early
part
of
september
had
been
fixed
for
the
theatricals
annie
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
and
the
preparations
remained
altogether
with
brandreth
the
minuet
he
said
to
her
one
afternoon
when
he
had
come
to
report
to
her
as
a
authority
is
going
to
be
something
exquisite
i
assure
you
a
good
many
of
the
ladies
studied
it
in
the
continental
times
you
know
when
we
had
all
those
martha
washington
parties
or
i
forgot
you
were
out
of
the
country
and
it
will
be
done
perfectly
we
going
to
have
the
scene
on
the
just
in
front
of
the
evergreens
do
you
know
and
then
the
balcony
scene
in
the
same
place
we
have
to
cut
some
of
the
business
between
romeo
and
juliet
because
it
too
long
you
know
and
some
of
it
too
too
passionate
we
could
do
it
properly
and
we
decided
to
leave
it
out
but
we
sketch
along
through
the
play
and
we
have
friar
laurence
coming
with
juliet
out
of
his
cell
onto
the
and
meeting
romeo
so
that
tells
the
story
of
the
marriage
you
ca
imagine
what
a
mercutio
putney
makes
he
throws
himself
into
it
heart
and
soul
especially
where
he
fights
with
tybalt
and
gets
killed
i
give
him
lines
there
out
of
other
scenes
too
the
sets
that
part
admirably
they
come
out
of
a
street
at
the
side
i
think
the
scenery
will
surprise
you
miss
kilburn
well
and
then
we
have
the
nurse
and
juliet
and
the
poison
scene
we
put
it
into
the
garden
on
the
and
we
condense
the
different
acts
so
as
to
give
an
idea
of
all
that
happened
with
romeo
banished
and
all
that
then
he
comes
back
from
mantua
and
we
have
the
tomb
scene
set
at
one
side
of
the
just
opposite
the
street
scene
and
he
fights
with
paris
and
then
we
have
juliet
come
to
the
door
of
the
tomb
it
a
liberty
of
course
but
we
could
arrange
the
light
inside
and
she
stabs
herself
and
falls
on
romeo
body
and
that
ends
the
play
you
see
it
gives
a
notion
of
the
whole
action
and
tells
the
story
pretty
well
i
think
you
be
i
no
doubt
i
shall
said
annie
did
you
make
the
adaptation
yourself
brandreth
well
yes
i
did
brandreth
modestly
admitted
it
been
a
good
deal
of
work
but
it
been
a
pleasure
too
you
know
how
that
is
miss
kilburn
in
your
speak
of
my
charities
brandreth
i
not
a
charitable
you
wo
get
people
to
believe
said
brandreth
everybody
knows
how
much
good
you
do
but
as
i
was
saying
my
idea
was
to
give
a
notion
of
the
whole
play
in
a
series
of
passages
or
tableaux
some
of
my
friends
think
i
succeeded
so
well
in
telling
the
story
do
you
know
without
a
change
of
scene
that
they
urging
me
to
publish
my
arrangement
for
the
use
of
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
idea
said
annie
i
suppose
chapley
would
do
it
well
i
do
know
i
do
know
brandreth
answered
with
a
note
of
trouble
in
his
voice
i
afraid
not
he
added
sadly
miss
kilburn
been
put
in
a
very
unfair
position
by
miss
northwick
changing
her
mind
about
juliet
after
the
part
had
been
offered
to
miss
chapley
i
been
made
the
means
of
a
seeming
slight
to
miss
chapley
when
if
it
had
been
for
the
cause
i
rather
have
thrown
up
the
whole
affair
she
gave
up
the
part
instantly
when
she
heard
that
miss
northwick
wished
to
change
her
mind
but
all
the
same
i
know
he
stopped
and
annie
said
encouragingly
yes
i
see
but
perhaps
she
does
really
that
what
she
said
returned
brandreth
ruefully
but
i
do
know
i
have
never
spoken
of
it
with
her
since
i
went
to
tell
her
about
it
after
i
got
miss
northwick
well
brandreth
i
think
you
really
been
victimised
and
i
believe
the
social
union
will
ever
be
worth
what
it
i
was
sure
you
would
appreciate
would
understand
and
brandreth
pressed
her
hand
gratefully
in
she
heard
him
talking
with
some
one
at
the
gate
whose
sharp
all
right
my
son
identified
putney
she
ran
to
the
door
to
welcome
him
oh
you
here
she
rejoiced
at
sight
of
putney
too
i
can
send
ellen
home
suggested
putney
oh
indeed
said
annie
with
at
which
she
laughed
with
putney
only
it
seemed
too
good
to
have
you
both
she
explained
kissing
putney
i
glad
to
see
you
well
what
the
reason
putney
dropped
into
a
chair
and
began
to
rock
nervously
do
be
ashamed
we
selfish
has
brandreth
been
putting
up
any
more
jobs
on
you
no
no
only
giving
me
a
hint
of
his
troubles
and
sorrows
with
those
wretched
social
union
theatricals
poor
young
fellow
i
sorry
for
him
he
is
really
very
sweet
and
unselfish
i
like
yes
brandreth
is
one
of
the
most
fellows
i
ever
saw
said
putney
that
juliet
business
has
pretty
near
been
the
death
of
him
i
told
him
to
offer
miss
chapley
some
other
part
rosaline
the
part
of
the
young
lady
who
was
dropped
but
he
could
seem
to
see
it
well
and
how
come
on
the
good
works
annie
the
good
works
ralph
tell
me
people
think
me
a
charitable
person
do
they
suppose
i
done
or
can
do
any
good
whatever
she
looked
from
putney
to
his
wife
and
back
again
with
comic
entreaty
why
are
you
a
charitable
person
do
you
do
any
good
he
asked
no
she
shouted
not
the
least
in
the
world
it
is
pretty
rough
said
putney
taking
out
a
cigar
for
a
dry
smoke
and
nobody
will
believe
me
when
i
report
what
you
say
annie
munger
is
telling
round
that
she
do
see
how
you
can
live
through
the
summer
at
the
rate
you
going
she
got
it
down
pretty
cold
about
your
taking
brother
peck
idea
of
the
invited
dance
and
supper
and
joining
hands
with
him
to
save
the
vanity
of
the
poor
she
says
that
your
suppression
of
that
one
unpopular
feature
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
promote
the
success
of
the
social
union
you
ought
to
be
glad
brother
peck
is
coming
to
the
to
the
theatricals
putney
nodded
his
head
that
what
he
says
i
believe
brother
peck
is
coming
to
see
how
the
upper
classes
amuse
themselves
when
they
really
try
to
benefit
the
lower
annie
would
not
laugh
at
his
joke
ralph
she
asked
is
it
true
that
peck
is
so
unpopular
in
his
church
is
he
really
going
to
be
turned
out
dismissed
oh
i
do
know
about
that
but
they
bounce
him
if
they
and
can
nothing
be
done
ca
his
friends
unite
oh
they
united
enough
now
what
they
afraid
of
is
that
they
not
numerous
enough
why
do
you
buy
in
annie
and
help
control
the
stock
that
old
unitarian
concern
of
yours
is
ever
going
to
get
into
running
order
again
and
if
you
owned
a
pew
in
ellen
church
you
could
have
a
vote
in
church
meeting
after
a
while
and
you
could
lend
brother
peck
your
moral
support
i
never
liked
that
sort
of
thing
ralph
i
should
believe
with
your
ellen
people
please
do
believe
with
them
either
but
i
always
vote
right
now
you
think
it
no
i
shall
not
think
it
over
i
do
approve
of
it
if
i
should
take
a
pew
in
your
church
it
would
be
simply
to
hear
peck
preach
and
contribute
toward
his
salary
yes
that
the
way
to
look
at
it
in
the
beginning
i
knew
work
round
why
annie
in
a
year
time
you
be
trying
to
votes
for
brother
i
should
vote
she
retorted
and
i
shall
keep
myself
out
of
all
temptation
by
not
going
to
your
ellen
church
putney
corrected
she
went
the
next
sunday
to
hear
peck
preach
and
putney
who
seemed
to
see
her
the
moment
she
entered
the
church
rose
as
the
sexton
was
showing
her
up
the
aisle
and
opened
the
door
of
his
pew
for
her
with
ironical
welcome
you
can
always
have
a
seat
with
us
annie
he
mocked
on
their
way
out
of
the
church
together
thank
you
ralph
she
answered
boldly
i
going
to
speak
to
the
sexton
for
a
xvi
a
wire
had
been
carried
from
the
village
to
the
scene
of
the
play
at
south
hatboro
and
electric
globes
fizzed
and
hissed
overhead
flooding
the
open
with
the
radiance
of
sharper
moonlight
and
stamping
the
thick
velvety
shadows
of
the
shrubbery
and
deep
into
the
raw
green
of
the
grass
along
its
borders
the
spectators
were
seated
on
the
verandas
and
terraced
turf
at
the
rear
of
the
house
and
they
crowded
the
sides
of
the
court
up
to
a
certain
point
where
a
cord
stretched
across
it
kept
them
from
encroaching
upon
the
space
intended
for
the
action
another
rope
enclosed
an
area
all
round
them
where
chairs
and
benches
were
placed
for
those
who
had
tickets
after
the
rejection
of
the
exclusive
feature
of
the
original
plan
munger
had
liberalised
more
and
more
she
caused
it
to
be
known
that
all
who
could
get
into
her
grounds
would
be
welcome
on
the
outside
of
that
rope
even
though
they
did
not
pay
anything
but
a
large
number
of
tickets
had
been
sold
to
the
hands
as
well
as
to
the
other
villagers
and
the
area
within
the
rope
was
closely
packed
some
of
the
boys
climbed
the
neighbouring
trees
where
from
time
to
time
the
town
authorities
threatened
them
but
did
not
really
dislodge
them
annie
with
other
friends
of
munger
gained
a
reserved
seat
on
the
veranda
through
the
windows
but
once
there
she
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
sufficiently
mixed
company
how
do
miss
kilburn
that
you
well
i
declare
said
a
voice
that
she
seemed
to
know
in
a
key
of
nervous
excitement
savor
husband
leaned
across
his
wife
lap
and
shook
hands
with
annie
william
thought
i
better
come
savor
seemed
called
upon
to
explain
i
got
to
do
ai
it
just
too
cute
for
anything
the
way
they
got
them
screens
worked
into
the
shrubbery
down
it
like
the
cycloraymy
to
boston
you
ca
tell
where
the
ground
ends
and
the
paintin
commences
oh
i
do
want
to
savor
laughed
at
his
wife
impatience
and
she
said
playfully
what
you
laughin
at
i
guess
you
full
as
excited
as
what
i
be
when
said
and
there
were
other
acquaintances
of
annie
from
over
the
track
in
the
group
about
her
and
upon
the
example
of
the
savors
they
all
greeted
her
the
wives
and
sweethearts
tittered
with
expectation
the
men
were
gravely
jocose
like
all
americans
in
unwonted
circumstances
but
they
were
respectful
to
the
coming
performance
perhaps
as
a
tribute
to
annie
she
wondered
how
some
of
them
came
to
have
those
seats
which
were
reserved
at
an
extra
price
she
did
not
allow
for
that
which
causes
the
american
workman
to
supply
himself
with
the
best
his
money
can
buy
while
his
money
lasts
she
turned
to
see
who
was
on
her
other
hand
a
row
of
three
small
children
stretched
from
her
to
gerrish
whom
she
did
not
recognise
at
first
oh
emmeline
she
said
and
then
for
want
of
something
else
she
added
where
is
gerrish
is
he
coming
he
was
detained
at
the
store
said
gerrish
with
cold
importance
but
he
will
be
here
may
i
ask
annie
she
pursued
solemnly
how
you
got
here
how
did
i
get
here
why
through
the
windows
did
you
may
i
ask
who
had
charge
of
the
arrangements
i
do
know
i
sure
said
annie
i
suppose
a
burst
of
music
came
from
the
dense
shadow
into
which
the
group
of
evergreens
at
the
bottom
of
the
deepened
away
from
the
glister
of
the
electrics
there
was
a
deeper
hush
then
a
slight
jarring
and
scraping
of
a
chair
beyond
gerrish
who
leaned
across
her
children
and
said
he
come
annie
right
through
the
parlour
window
her
voice
was
lifted
to
carry
above
the
music
and
all
the
people
near
were
able
to
share
the
fact
that
righted
gerrish
in
her
own
esteem
from
the
covert
of
the
low
pines
in
the
middle
of
the
scene
miss
northwick
and
brandreth
appeared
hand
in
hand
and
then
the
place
filled
with
figures
from
other
apertures
of
the
little
grove
and
through
the
artificial
wings
at
the
sides
and
walked
the
minuet
fellows
the
painter
had
helped
with
the
costumes
supplying
some
from
his
own
artistic
properties
and
mediævalising
others
the
boston
costumers
had
been
drawn
upon
by
the
men
and
they
all
moved
through
the
stately
figures
with
a
security
which
discipline
had
given
them
the
broad
solid
colours
which
they
wore
took
the
light
and
shadow
with
picturesque
effectiveness
the
masks
contributed
a
sense
of
mystery
novel
in
hatboro
and
kept
the
friends
of
the
dancers
in
exciting
doubt
of
their
identity
the
strangeness
of
the
audience
to
all
spectacles
of
the
sort
held
its
judgment
in
suspense
the
minuet
was
encored
and
had
to
be
given
again
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
applause
of
the
repetition
allowed
the
characters
to
be
heard
when
the
partners
of
the
minuet
began
to
move
about
arm
in
arm
and
the
drama
properly
began
when
the
applause
died
away
it
was
still
not
easy
to
hear
a
boy
in
one
of
the
trees
called
louder
and
made
some
of
the
people
laugh
but
for
the
rest
they
were
very
orderly
throughout
toward
the
end
of
the
fourth
act
annie
was
startled
by
a
child
dashing
itself
against
her
knees
and
breaking
into
a
gurgle
of
shy
laughter
as
children
do
why
you
little
witch
she
said
to
the
uplifted
face
of
idella
peck
where
is
your
father
oh
somewhere
said
the
child
with
entire
ease
of
mind
and
your
hat
said
annie
putting
her
hand
on
the
curly
bare
head
where
your
hat
on
the
on
the
ground
where
oh
i
do
know
said
idella
lightly
as
if
the
pursuit
bored
her
annie
pulled
her
up
on
her
lap
well
now
you
stay
here
with
me
if
you
please
till
your
papa
or
your
hat
comes
after
my
hat
ca
come
after
me
said
the
child
turning
back
her
head
so
as
to
laugh
her
sense
of
the
joke
in
annie
face
no
matter
your
papa
can
and
i
going
to
keep
idella
let
her
head
fall
back
against
annie
breast
and
began
to
finger
the
rings
on
the
hand
which
annie
laid
across
her
lap
to
keep
her
for
goodness
gracious
said
savor
who
you
got
there
miss
kilburn
mr
peck
little
where
she
spring
from
gerrish
leaned
forward
and
spoke
across
the
six
legs
of
her
children
who
were
all
three
standing
up
in
their
chairs
you
do
mean
to
say
that
idella
peck
where
her
father
somewhere
she
says
said
annie
willing
to
answer
gerrish
with
the
child
nonchalance
well
that
great
said
gerrish
i
should
think
he
better
be
looking
after
her
or
some
the
music
ceased
and
the
last
act
of
the
play
began
before
it
ended
idella
had
fallen
asleep
and
annie
sat
still
with
her
after
the
crowd
around
her
began
to
break
up
savor
kept
her
seat
beside
annie
she
said
do
you
want
i
should
spell
you
a
little
while
miss
kilburn
she
leaned
over
the
face
of
the
sleeping
child
why
she
ai
much
more
than
a
baby
william
you
go
and
see
if
you
ca
find
peck
i
goin
to
stay
here
with
miss
her
husband
humoured
her
whim
and
made
his
way
through
the
knots
and
clumps
of
people
toward
the
rope
enclosing
the
wo
you
let
me
hold
her
miss
kilburn
she
pleaded
again
no
no
she
is
heavy
i
like
to
hold
her
replied
annie
then
something
occurred
to
her
and
she
started
in
amazement
at
herself
or
yes
savor
you
take
her
a
while
and
she
put
the
child
into
the
arms
of
the
bereaved
creature
who
had
fallen
desolately
back
in
her
chair
she
hugged
idella
up
to
her
breast
and
hungrily
mumbled
her
with
kisses
and
moaned
out
over
her
oh
dear
oh
my
oh
my
xvii
the
people
beyond
the
rope
had
nearly
all
gone
away
and
savor
was
coming
back
across
the
court
with
peck
the
players
appeared
from
the
grove
at
the
other
end
of
the
court
in
their
vivid
costumes
chatting
and
laughing
with
their
friends
who
went
down
from
the
piazzas
and
terraces
to
congratulate
them
munger
hurried
about
among
them
saying
something
to
each
group
she
caught
sight
of
peck
and
savor
and
she
ran
after
them
arriving
with
them
where
annie
sat
i
hope
you
were
not
anxious
about
idella
annie
said
laughing
no
i
did
miss
her
at
once
said
the
minister
simply
and
then
i
thought
she
had
merely
gone
off
with
some
of
the
other
children
who
were
playing
you
shall
talk
all
that
over
later
said
munger
now
miss
kilburn
i
want
you
and
peck
and
and
savor
to
stay
for
a
cup
of
coffee
that
i
going
to
give
our
friends
out
there
do
you
think
they
deserve
it
was
it
a
wonderful
success
they
must
be
frightfully
exhausted
just
go
right
out
to
them
i
be
with
you
in
one
moment
oh
yes
the
child
well

her
into
the
house

place
for
her
and
then
you
can
go
out
with
i
guess
you
wo
get
maria
away
from
her
very
easy
said
savor
laughing
his
wife
stood
with
the
child
cheek
pressed
tight
against
hers
oh
i
manage
that
said
munger
i
counting
on
she
added
in
a
hurried
undertone
to
annie
i
asked
a
number
of
the
workpeople
to
stay
representative
workpeople
the
foremen
in
the
different
shops
and
their
families
and
you
find
your
friends
of
all
classes
together
it
a
great
day
for
the
social
union
she
said
aloud
i
sure
must
feel
that
peck
miss
kilburn
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
saving
us
from
a
great
mistake
at
the
outset
and
now
your
staying
she
continued
will
give
it
just
the
appearance
we
want
i
going
to
keep
your
little
girl
as
a
hostage
and
you
shall
not
go
till
i
let
you
come
savor
she
bustled
away
with
savor
and
peck
reluctantly
accompanied
annie
down
over
the
lawn
he
was
silent
but
savor
was
hilarious
well
putney
he
said
when
he
joined
the
group
of
which
putney
was
the
centre
you
done
that
in
order
i
never
see
anything
much
better
than
the
way
you
carried
on
with
thank
you
savor
said
putney
i
glad
you
liked
it
you
say
i
was
trying
to
flatter
her
up
much
no
no
savor
assented
with
delight
in
the
joke
well
annie
said
putney
he
shook
hands
with
her
and
putney
who
was
there
with
morrell
asked
her
where
she
had
sat
we
kept
looking
all
round
for
yes
said
putney
with
his
hand
on
his
boy
shoulder
we
wanted
to
know
how
you
liked
the
ralph
it
was
incomparable
well
that
will
do
for
a
beginning
it
a
little
cold
but
it
in
the
right
spirit
you
mean
that
the
mercutio
was
comparable
to
the
oh
lyra
was
wonderful
said
annie
do
you
think
so
ellen
she
was
lyra
said
putney
definitely
no
she
was
lyra
at
all
retorted
annie
that
was
the
marvel
of
it
she
was
juliet
perhaps
she
was
a
little
of
both
suggested
putney
what
did
you
think
of
the
performance
peck
i
do
want
a
personal
tribute
but
if
you
offer
it
i
shall
not
be
i
have
been
very
much
interested
said
the
minister
it
was
all
very
new
to
me
i
realised
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
great
power
that
the
theatre
must
be
i
felt
how
much
the
drama
could
do
how
much
well
that
what
we
after
said
putney
we
had
no
personal
motive
good
right
straight
along
was
our
motto
nobody
wanted
to
outshine
anybody
else
i
kept
my
mercutio
down
all
through
so
not
to
get
ahead
of
romeo
or
tybalt
in
the
public
esteem
did
our
friends
outside
the
rope
catch
on
to
my
idea
peck
smiled
at
the
banter
but
he
seemed
not
to
know
just
what
to
say
and
putney
went
on
that
why
i
made
it
so
bad
i
did
want
anybody
to
go
home
feeling
sorry
that
mercutio
was
killed
i
do
suppose
winthrop
could
have
you
wo
sleep
yourself
i
afraid
said
his
wife
oh
munger
has
promised
me
a
particularly
weak
cup
of
coffee
she
has
got
us
all
in
it
seems
for
a
sort
of
supper
in
spite
of
everything
i
understand
it
includes
representatives
of
all
the
stations
and
conditions
present
except
the
outcasts
beyond
the
rope
i
do
see
what
you
doing
here
was
peck
really
outside
the
rope
annie
asked
morrell
as
they
dropped
apart
from
the
others
a
little
i
believe
he
gave
his
chair
to
one
of
the
women
from
the
outside
said
the
doctor
annie
moved
with
him
toward
lyra
who
was
joking
with
some
of
the
hands
with
all
her
she
had
the
effect
of
patronising
them
as
she
stood
talking
about
the
play
with
them
in
her
drawl
which
she
had
got
back
to
again
they
were
admiring
her
in
her
dress
of
the
querulous
old
nurse
and
told
her
how
they
never
would
have
known
her
but
there
was
an
insincerity
in
the
effusion
of
some
of
the
more
nervous
women
and
in
the
reticence
of
the
others
who
were
holding
back
out
of
she
met
annie
and
morrell
with
eager
relief
well
annie
perfect
well
now
that
very
nice
you
ca
go
beyond
perfect
you
know
i
do
it
pretty
well
did
i
poor
brandreth
have
you
seen
him
you
must
say
something
comforting
to
him
he
really
been
sacrificed
in
this
business
you
know
he
wanted
miss
chapley
she
would
have
made
a
lovely
juliet
of
course
she
blames
him
for
it
she
thinks
he
wanted
to
make
up
to
miss
northwick
when
miss
northwick
was
just
flinging
herself
at
jack
look
at
her
jack
wilmington
and
miss
sue
northwick
were
standing
together
near
her
father
and
a
party
of
her
friends
and
she
was
smiling
and
talking
at
him
eyes
lips
gestures
attitude
expressed
in
the
proud
girl
a
fawning
eagerness
to
please
the
man
who
received
her
homage
rather
as
if
it
bored
him
his
indifferent
manner
may
have
been
one
secret
of
his
power
over
her
and
perhaps
she
was
not
capable
of
all
the
suffering
she
was
capable
of
inflicting
lyra
turned
to
walk
toward
the
house
deflecting
a
little
in
the
direction
of
her
nephew
and
miss
northwick
jack
she
drawled
over
the
shoulder
next
them
as
she
passed
i
wish
you
bring
your
aunty
wrap
to
her
on
the
why
stay
here
putney
called
after
her
they
going
to
fetch
the
refreshments
out
yes
but
i
tired
ralph
and
i
ca
sit
on
the
grass
at
my
she
moved
on
with
her
sweeping
lounging
pace
and
jack
wilmington
after
a
moment
hesitation
bowed
to
miss
northwick
and
went
after
her
the
girl
remained
apart
from
her
friends
as
if
expecting
his
return
silhouetted
against
the
bright
windows
lyra
waited
till
jack
wilmington
reappeared
with
a
shawl
and
laid
it
on
her
shoulders
then
she
sank
into
a
chair
the
young
man
stood
beside
her
talking
down
upon
her
something
restive
and
insistent
expressed
itself
in
their
respective
attitudes
he
sat
down
at
her
side
miss
northwick
joined
her
friends
carelessly
ah
miss
kilburn
said
brandreth
voice
at
annie
ear
i
glad
to
find
you
i
just
run
home
with
mother
she
feels
the
night
air
and
i
was
afraid
you
would
slip
through
our
fingers
before
i
got
back
this
little
business
of
the
refreshments
was
an
afterthought
of
munger
and
we
meant
it
for
a
surprise
we
knew
you
approve
of
it
in
the
form
it
he
looked
round
at
the
straggling
workpeople
who
represented
the
harmonisation
of
classes
keeping
to
themselves
as
if
they
had
been
there
alone
yes
annie
was
obliged
to
say
it
very
she
added
you
must
all
be
rather
hungry
brandreth
if
the
social
union
ever
gets
on
its
feet
it
will
have
to
thank
more
than
any
oh
do
speak
of
me
miss
kilburn
do
you
know
we
netted
about
two
hundred
dollars
is
that
pretty
good
doctor
very
said
the
doctor
had
we
better
follow
example
and
get
up
under
the
piazza
roof
i
afraid
you
be
the
worse
for
the
night
air
miss
kilburn
putney
he
called
to
his
friend
going
up
to
the
all
right
i
guess
that
a
good
the
doctor
called
to
the
different
knots
and
groups
telling
them
to
come
up
to
the
house
some
of
the
workpeople
slipped
away
through
the
grounds
and
did
not
come
the
northwicks
and
their
friends
moved
toward
the
house
munger
came
down
the
lawn
to
meet
her
guests
ah
that
right
much
better
indoors
i
was
just
coming
for
she
addressed
herself
more
particularly
to
the
northwicks
coffee
will
be
ready
in
a
few
moments
we
met
with
a
little
i
afraid
we
must
say
good
night
at
once
said
northwick
we
had
arranged
to
have
our
friends
and
some
other
guests
with
us
at
home
and
we
quite
late
munger
protested
take
our
juliet
from
us
oh
miss
northwick
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
the
whole
play
turned
upon
you
it
just
as
well
she
said
to
annie
as
the
northwicks
and
their
friends
walked
across
the
lawn
to
the
gate
where
they
had
carriages
waiting
they
have
been
difficult
to
manage
and
everybody
else
will
feel
a
little
more
at
home
without
them
poor
brandreth
i
sure
will
i
did
pity
you
so
with
such
a
juliet
on
your
hands
the
representatives
of
the
lower
classes
were
less
at
ease
than
they
were
without
some
of
the
ministers
mingled
with
them
and
tried
to
form
a
bond
between
them
and
the
other
villagers
peck
took
no
part
in
this
work
he
stood
holding
his
elbows
with
his
hands
and
talking
with
a
perfunctory
air
to
an
old
lady
of
his
congregation
the
young
ladies
of
south
hatboro
as
munger
assistants
went
about
impartially
to
high
and
low
with
trays
of
refreshments
annie
saw
putney
where
he
stood
with
his
wife
and
boy
refuse
coffee
and
she
watched
him
anxiously
when
the
came
he
waved
his
hand
over
it
and
said
no
i
take
some
of
the
as
he
lifted
a
glass
of
it
toward
his
lips
he
stopped
and
made
as
if
to
put
it
down
again
and
his
hand
shook
so
that
he
spilled
some
of
it
then
he
dashed
it
off
and
reached
for
another
glass
i
want
some
more
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
he
drank
a
second
glass
and
when
he
saw
a
tray
coming
toward
annie
where
morrell
had
joined
her
he
came
over
and
exchanged
his
empty
glass
for
a
full
one
not
much
to
brag
of
as
lemonade
he
said
but
rum
look
here
putney
whispered
the
doctor
laying
his
hand
on
his
arm
do
you
take
any
more
of
that
give
me
that
glass
oh
all
right
laughed
putney
dashing
it
off
you
welcome
to
the
tumbler
if
you
want
it
xviii
munger
guests
kept
on
talking
and
laughing
with
the
coffee
and
the
punch
there
began
to
be
a
little
more
freedom
some
prohibitionists
among
the
working
people
went
away
when
they
found
that
the
lemonade
was
punch
but
munger
did
not
know
it
and
she
saw
the
ideal
of
a
social
union
figuratively
accomplished
in
her
own
house
she
stirred
about
among
her
guests
till
she
produced
a
fleeting
empty
among
them
one
of
the
hands
with
an
inextinguishable
scent
of
leather
and
the
character
of
a
droll
seconded
her
efforts
with
noisy
jokes
he
proposed
games
and
would
not
be
snubbed
by
the
refusal
of
his
boss
to
countenance
him
he
had
the
applause
of
so
many
others
munger
approved
of
the
idea
do
you
think
it
would
be
great
fun
gerrish
she
asked
well
now
if
squire
putney
would
lead
off
said
the
joker
looking
round
putney
could
not
be
found
nor
morrell
they
off
somewhere
for
a
smoke
said
munger
well
that
right
i
want
everybody
to
feel
that
my
house
is
their
own
and
to
come
and
go
just
as
they
like
do
you
suppose
peck
is
offended
she
asked
under
her
breath
as
she
passed
annie
he
feel
that
this
is
the
same
thing
but
i
ca
see
him
anywhere
he
would
go
without
taking
leave
you
do
suppose
annie
joined
putney
they
talked
at
first
with
those
who
came
to
ask
where
putney
and
the
doctor
were
but
finally
they
withdrew
into
a
little
alcove
from
the
parlour
where
munger
approved
of
their
being
when
she
discovered
them
they
must
be
very
tired
and
ought
to
rest
on
the
lounge
there
her
theory
of
the
exhaustion
of
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
play
embraced
their
families
the
time
wore
on
toward
midnight
and
her
guests
got
themselves
away
with
more
or
less
difficulty
as
they
attempted
the
formality
of
or
not
some
of
the
hands
who
thought
this
necessary
found
it
a
serious
affair
but
most
of
them
slipped
off
without
saying
good
night
to
munger
or
expressing
that
rapture
with
the
whole
evening
from
beginning
to
end
which
the
ladies
of
south
hatboro
professed
the
ladies
of
south
hatboro
and
old
hatboro
had
met
in
a
general
intimacy
not
approached
before
and
they
parted
with
a
flow
of
mutual
esteem
the
gerrish
children
had
dropped
asleep
in
nooks
and
corners
from
which
gerrish
hunted
them
up
and
put
them
together
for
departure
while
his
wife
remained
with
munger
unable
to
stop
talking
and
no
longer
amenable
to
the
looks
with
which
he
governed
her
in
public
lyra
came
downstairs
hooded
and
wrapped
for
departure
with
jack
wilmington
by
her
side
why
she
said
looking
into
the
little
alcove
from
the
hall
are
you
here
yet
and
annie
where
in
the
world
is
ralph
at
the
pleading
look
with
which
putney
replied
she
exclaimed
oh
it
what
i
was
afraid
of
i
do
see
what
the
woman
could
have
been
about
but
of
course
she
did
think
of
poor
ralph
ellen
let
me
take
you
and
winthrop
home
morrell
will
be
sure
to
bring
well
said
putney
passively
but
without
rising
annie
can
come
too
there
plenty
of
room
jack
can
jack
wilmington
joined
lyra
in
urging
annie
to
take
his
place
he
said
to
her
apart
young
munger
has
been
telling
me
that
putney
got
at
the
sideboard
and
carried
off
the
rum
i
stay
and
help
look
after
a
crazy
laugh
came
into
the
parlour
from
the
piazza
outside
and
the
group
in
the
alcove
started
forward
putney
stood
at
a
window
resting
one
arm
on
the
bar
of
the
long
lower
sash
which
was
raised
to
its
full
height
and
looking
ironically
in
upon
munger
and
her
remaining
guests
he
was
still
in
his
mercutio
dress
but
he
had
lost
his
plumed
cap
and
was
bareheaded
a
pace
or
two
behind
him
stood
peck
regarding
the
effect
of
this
apparition
upon
the
company
with
the
same
dreamy
indrawn
presence
he
had
in
the
pulpit
well
munger
i
glad
i
got
back
in
time
to
tell
you
how
much
enjoyed
it
brother
peck
wanted
me
to
go
home
but
i
told
him
not
till
i
thanked
munger
brother
peck
not
till
i
drunk
her
health
in
her
own
old
particular
he
put
to
his
lips
the
black
bottle
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
right
hand
behind
him
then
he
took
it
away
looked
at
it
and
flung
it
the
piazza
floor
did
get
hold
of
the
inexhaustible
bottle
that
time
never
do
but
it
a
good
article
a
better
article
than
you
used
to
sell
on
the
sly
bill
gerrish
excuse
my
helping
myself
munger
i
knew
you
want
me
to
well
been
a
great
occasion
he
winked
at
the
hostess
had
your
little
invited
supper
after
all
you
a
manager
munger
you
made
even
the
wrath
of
brother
peck
to
praise
the
ladies
involuntarily
shrank
backward
as
putney
suddenly
entered
through
the
window
and
gained
the
corner
of
the
piano
at
a
dash
he
stayed
himself
against
it
slightly
swaying
and
turned
his
flaming
eyes
from
one
to
another
as
if
questioning
whom
he
should
attack
next
except
for
the
wild
look
in
them
which
was
not
so
much
wilder
than
they
wore
in
all
times
of
excitement
and
an
occasional
halt
at
a
difficult
word
he
gave
no
sign
of
being
drunk
the
liquor
had
as
yet
merely
intensified
him
munger
had
the
inspiration
to
treat
him
as
one
caresses
a
dangerous
lunatic
i
sure
you
very
kind
putney
to
come
back
do
sit
down
why
demanded
putney
everybody
else
that
true
said
munger
i
sure
i
do
know
why
oh
yes
you
do
munger
it
because
they
want
to
have
a
good
view
of
a
man
who
made
a
fool
of
himself
oh
now
said
munger
with
hospitable
deprecation
i
sure
no
one
wants
to
do
anything
of
the
she
looked
round
at
the
company
for
corroboration
but
no
one
cared
to
attract
putney
attention
by
any
sound
or
sign
but
i
tell
you
what
said
putney
with
a
savage
burst
that
a
woman
who
puts
before
a
poor
devil
who
ca
keep
out
of
it
when
he
sees
it
is
better
worth
looking
mr
putney
i
assure
you
said
munger
that
it
was
the
punch
and
i
really
did
think
i
did
remember
she
turned
toward
putney
with
her
explanation
but
putney
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
and
he
turned
upon
gerrish
how
that
grave
getting
along
that
you
dug
for
your
porter
gerrish
remained
prudently
silent
i
know
you
billy
you
all
right
you
got
the
pull
on
your
conscience
we
all
have
one
way
or
another
here
annie
kilburn
come
back
from
rome
where
she
could
seem
to
fix
it
up
with
hers
to
suit
her
and
she
trying
to
get
round
it
in
hatboro
with
good
works
why
there
is
any
occasion
for
good
works
in
hatboro
i
could
have
told
you
that
before
you
came
he
said
addressing
annie
directly
what
we
want
is
faith
and
lots
of
it
the
church
is
going
to
pieces
because
we
have
got
any
his
hand
slipped
from
the
piano
and
he
dropped
heavily
back
upon
a
chair
that
stood
near
the
concussion
seemed
to
complete
in
his
brain
the
transition
from
his
normal
dispositions
to
their
opposite
which
had
already
begun
bill
gerrish
has
done
more
for
hatboro
than
any
other
man
in
the
place
he
the
only
man
that
holds
the
church
together
because
he
knows
the
value
of
he
said
this
without
a
trace
of
irony
glaring
at
annie
with
fierce
defiance
you
come
back
here
and
try
to
set
up
for
a
saint
in
a
town
where
william
gerrish
has
done
has
done
more
to
establish
the
business
on
a
basis
than
any
other
man
out
of
new
york
or
he
stopped
and
looked
round
mystified
as
if
this
were
not
the
point
which
he
had
been
aiming
at
lyra
broke
into
a
spluttering
laugh
and
suddenly
checked
herself
putney
smiled
slightly
pretty
good
eh
say
where
was
i
he
asked
slyly
lyra
hid
her
face
behind
annie
shoulder
what
that
dress
you
got
on
all
this
about
anyway
oh
yes
i
know
and
social
union
well
he
resumed
with
a
frown
there
too
much
and
too
much
social
union
in
this
town
he
stopped
and
seemed
preparing
to
launch
some
deadly
phrase
at
wilmington
but
he
only
said
you
all
right
mrs
munger
said
gerrish
we
must
be
going
good
night
gerrish
it
time
the
children
were
at
of
course
it
is
said
putney
watching
the
gerrishes
getting
their
children
together
he
waved
his
hand
after
them
and
called
out
william
gerrish
you
a
man
i
honour
he
laid
hold
of
the
piano
and
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
seemed
to
become
aware
for
the
first
time
of
his
wife
where
she
stood
with
their
boy
beside
her
what
you
doing
here
with
that
child
at
this
time
of
night
he
shouted
at
her
all
that
was
left
of
the
man
in
his
eyes
changing
into
the
glare
of
a
pitiless
brute
why
do
you
go
home
you
want
to
show
people
what
i
did
to
him
you
want
to
publish
my
shame
do
you
is
that
it
look
here
he
began
to
work
himself
along
toward
her
by
help
of
the
piano
a
step
was
heard
on
the
piazza
without
and
morrell
entered
through
the
open
window
come
now
putney
he
said
gently
the
other
men
closed
round
them
putney
stopped
what
this
interfering
in
family
matters
you
better
go
home
and
look
after
your
own
wives
if
you
got
any
get
out
the
way
you
mind
your
own
business
doc
morrell
you
meddle
too
his
speech
was
thickening
and
breaking
you
think
science
going
do
everything
evolution
talk
me
about
evolution
what
evolution
done
for
hatboro
gerrish
store
one
day
of
christianity
real
christianity
where
that
boy
if
i
get
hold
of
him
he
lunged
forward
and
jack
wilmington
and
young
munger
stepped
before
him
putney
had
not
moved
nor
lost
the
look
of
sad
passive
vigilance
which
she
had
worn
since
her
husband
reappeared
she
pushed
the
men
aside
ralph
behave
yourself
winthrop
and
we
want
you
to
take
us
home
come
now
she
passed
her
arm
through
his
and
the
boy
took
his
other
hand
the
action
so
full
of
fearless
custom
and
wonted
affection
from
them
both
seemed
with
her
words
to
operate
another
total
change
in
his
mood
all
right
i
going
ellen
got
to
say
good
night
munger
he
managed
to
get
to
her
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
and
his
boy
at
his
side
want
to
thank
you
for
a
pleasant
evening
munger
want
to
thank
you
and
want
to
thank
you
munger
said
putney
with
an
intensity
of
bitterness
no
repetition
of
the
words
could
give
it
been
a
pleasant
evening
for
putney
wished
to
stop
and
explain
but
his
wife
pulled
him
away
morrell
and
annie
followed
to
get
them
safely
into
the
carriage
he
went
with
them
and
when
she
came
back
munger
was
saying
i
will
leave
it
to
wilmington
or
any
one
if
i
to
blame
it
had
quite
gone
out
of
my
head
about
putney
there
was
plenty
of
coffee
besides
and
if
everything
that
could
harm
particular
persons
had
to
be
kept
out
of
the
way
society
could
go
on
we
ought
to
consider
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
she
looked
round
from
one
to
another
for
support
no
one
said
anything
and
munger
trembling
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
made
a
direct
appeal
do
you
think
so
peck
the
minister
broke
his
silence
with
reluctance
it
sometimes
best
to
have
the
effect
of
error
unmistakable
then
we
are
sure
it
munger
gave
a
sob
of
relief
into
her
handkerchief
yes
that
just
what
i
lyra
bent
her
face
on
her
arm
and
jack
wilmington
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
where
he
stood
peck
remained
staring
at
munger
as
if
doubtful
what
to
do
then
he
said
you
seem
not
to
have
understood
me
i
should
be
to
blame
if
i
left
you
in
doubt
you
have
been
guilty
of
forgetting
your
weakness
and
if
the
consequence
has
promptly
followed
in
his
shame
it
is
for
you
to
realise
it
i
wish
you
a
good
he
went
out
with
a
dignity
that
thrilled
annie
lyra
leaned
toward
her
and
said
choking
with
laughter
he
left
idella
asleep
upstairs
we
of
us
got
memories
have
we
run
after
him
annie
said
to
jack
wilmington
in
undertone
and
get
him
into
my
carriage
i
get
the
little
girl
lyra
speak
of
never
said
wilmington
with
delight
i
solid
for
peck
every
xix
annie
made
up
a
bed
for
idella
on
a
wide
lounge
in
her
room
and
put
her
away
in
it
swathed
in
a
which
she
found
among
the
survivals
of
her
own
childish
clothing
in
that
old
chest
of
drawers
when
she
woke
in
the
morning
she
looked
across
at
the
little
creature
with
a
tender
sense
of
possession
and
protection
suffusing
her
troubled
recollections
of
the
night
before
idella
stirred
stretched
herself
with
a
long
sigh
and
then
sat
up
and
stared
round
the
strange
place
as
if
she
were
still
in
a
dream
would
you
like
to
come
in
here
with
me
annie
suggested
from
her
bed
the
child
pushed
back
her
hair
with
her
little
hands
and
after
waiting
to
realise
the
situation
to
the
limit
of
her
small
experience
she
said
with
a
smile
that
showed
her
pretty
teeth
then
idella
tumbled
out
of
bed
pulling
up
the
nightgown
which
was
too
long
for
her
and
softly
thumped
across
the
carpet
annie
leaned
over
and
lifted
her
up
and
pressed
the
little
face
to
her
own
and
felt
the
play
of
the
quick
light
breath
over
her
cheek
would
you
like
to
stay
with
me
live
with
me
idella
she
asked
the
child
turned
her
face
away
and
hid
a
roguish
smile
in
the
pillow
i
do
would
you
like
to
be
my
little
girl
no
why
not
because
because
she
seemed
to
search
her
mind
because
your
are
too
oh
is
that
all
that
no
reason
think
of
something
idella
rubbed
her
face
hard
on
the
pillow
you
dress
up
she
lifted
her
face
and
looked
with
eyes
of
laughing
malice
into
annie
and
annie
pushed
her
face
against
idella
neck
and
cried
you
a
rogue
the
little
one
screamed
with
laughter
and
gurgled
oh
you
tickle
you
tickle
they
had
a
childish
romp
prolonged
through
the
details
of
idella
washing
and
dressing
and
annie
tried
to
lose
in
her
frolic
with
the
child
the
anxieties
that
had
beset
her
waking
she
succeeded
in
confusing
them
with
one
another
in
one
dull
indefinite
pain
she
wondered
when
peck
would
come
for
idella
but
they
were
still
at
their
belated
breakfast
when
bolton
came
in
to
say
that
bolton
had
met
the
minister
on
his
way
up
and
had
asked
him
if
idella
might
not
stay
the
week
out
with
them
i
don
know
but
he
done
he
ought
but
she
can
be
with
us
the
rest
part
when
you
got
done
with
i
have
begun
to
get
done
with
her
said
annie
i
glad
bolton
after
breakfast
bolton
himself
appeared
to
ask
if
idella
might
go
up
to
the
orchard
with
him
idella
ran
out
of
the
room
and
came
back
with
her
hat
on
and
tugging
to
get
into
her
shabby
little
sack
annie
helped
her
with
it
and
idella
tucked
her
hand
into
bolton
loose
hard
fist
and
gave
it
a
pull
toward
the
door
well
i
do
see
but
what
she
goin
he
said
yes
you
better
ask
her
the
next
time
if
can
go
said
annie
well
why
do
you
asked
bolton
humouring
the
joke
i
guess
enjoy
it
about
as
well
as
any
we
just
goin
for
a
basket
of
for
pies
i
guess
we
ai
to
be
gone
a
great
annie
watched
them
up
the
lane
from
the
library
window
with
a
queer
grudge
at
heart
bolton
stiffly
lumbering
forward
at
an
angle
of
degrees
the
child
whirling
and
dancing
at
his
side
and
now
before
and
now
after
him
at
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
before
the
front
door
annie
turned
away
with
such
an
imperative
need
of
its
being
morrell
buggy
that
it
was
almost
an
intolerable
disappointment
to
find
it
munger
phaeton
munger
burst
in
upon
her
in
an
excitement
which
somehow
had
an
effect
of
premeditation
miss
kilburn
i
wish
to
know
what
you
think
of
and
behaviour
to
me
and
peck
in
my
own
house
last
night
they
are
friends
of
yours
and
i
wish
to
know
if
you
approve
of
it
i
come
to
you
their
friend
and
i
am
sure
you
will
feel
as
i
do
that
my
hospitality
has
been
abused
it
was
an
outrage
for
putney
to
get
intoxicated
in
my
house
and
for
peck
to
attack
me
as
he
did
before
everybody
because
putney
had
taken
advantage
of
his
privileges
was
abominable
i
am
not
a
member
of
his
church
and
even
if
i
were
he
would
have
had
no
right
to
speak
so
to
annie
felt
the
blood
fly
to
her
head
and
she
waited
a
moment
to
regain
her
coolness
i
wonder
you
came
to
ask
me
munger
if
you
were
so
sure
that
i
agreed
with
you
i
certainly
and
putney
friend
and
so
far
as
admiring
peck
sincerity
and
goodness
is
concerned
friend
but
i
obliged
to
say
that
you
mistaken
about
the
she
folded
her
hands
at
her
waist
and
stood
up
very
straight
looking
firmly
at
munger
who
made
a
show
of
taking
a
new
grip
of
her
senses
as
she
sank
unbidden
into
a
chair
why
what
do
you
mean
miss
kilburn
it
seems
to
me
that
i
need
why
but
you
must
you
you
know
i
ca
be
so
i
must
know
where
i
i
must
be
sure
of
my
i
go
on
without
understanding
just
how
much
you
mean
by
my
being
she
looked
annie
in
the
face
with
eyes
superficially
expressive
of
indignant
surprise
and
annie
perceived
that
she
wished
to
restore
herself
in
her
own
esteem
by
browbeating
some
one
else
into
the
affirmation
of
her
innocence
well
if
you
must
know
munger
i
mean
that
you
ought
to
have
remembered
putney
infirmity
and
that
it
was
cruel
to
put
temptation
in
his
way
everybody
knows
that
he
ca
resist
it
and
that
he
is
making
such
a
hard
fight
to
keep
out
of
it
and
then
if
you
press
me
for
an
opinion
i
must
say
that
you
were
not
justifiable
in
asking
peck
to
take
part
in
a
social
entertainment
when
we
had
explicitly
dropped
that
part
of
the
munger
had
not
pressed
annie
for
an
opinion
on
this
point
at
all
but
in
their
interest
in
it
they
both
ignored
the
fact
munger
tacitly
admitted
her
position
in
retorting
he
need
have
you
made
him
stay
you
remember
how
and
he
could
have
got
away
without
being
and
you
think
he
was
rude
to
scold
me
before
my
guests
he
told
you
the
truth
he
did
wish
to
say
anything
but
you
forced
him
to
speak
just
as
you
have
forced
forced
miss
kilburn
yes
i
do
at
all
agree
with
peck
in
many
things
but
he
is
a
good
man
and
last
night
he
spoke
the
truth
i
should
be
speaking
it
if
i
did
tell
you
i
thought
very
well
then
said
munger
rising
after
this
you
ca
expect
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
social
union
you
could
me
to
if
that
your
opinion
of
my
i
have
expressed
any
opinion
of
your
character
munger
if
remember
please
and
as
for
the
social
union
i
shall
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
it
annie
drew
herself
up
a
little
higher
and
silently
waited
for
her
visitor
to
go
but
munger
remained
i
do
believe
putney
herself
would
say
what
you
have
said
she
remarked
after
an
embarrassing
moment
if
it
were
really
so
i
should
be
willing
to
make
any
reparation
to
acknowledge
it
will
you
go
with
me
to
putney
i
have
my
phaeton
here
and
i
should
dream
of
going
to
putney
with
munger
urged
with
the
effect
of
invincible
argument
i
been
down
in
the
village
and
i
talked
to
a
good
many
about
it
some
of
them
had
heard
of
it
before
and
i
must
say
miss
kilburn
that
people
generally
take
a
very
different
view
of
it
from
what
you
do
they
think
that
my
hospitality
has
been
shamefully
abused
gates
said
he
should
think
i
would
have
putney
arrested
but
i
do
care
for
all
that
what
i
wish
is
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
right
and
if
i
can
go
with
you
to
call
on
putney
i
shall
not
care
what
any
one
else
says
will
you
come
certainly
not
cried
annie
they
both
stood
a
moment
and
in
this
moment
morrell
drove
up
and
dropped
his
beyond
munger
phaeton
as
he
entered
she
said
we
will
let
morrell
decide
i
been
asking
miss
kilburn
to
go
with
me
to
putney
i
think
it
would
be
a
graceful
and
proper
thing
for
me
to
do
to
express
my
sympathy
and
interest
and
to
hear
what
putney
really
has
to
say
do
think
i
ought
to
go
to
see
her
doctor
the
doctor
laughed
i
ca
prescribe
in
matters
of
social
duty
but
what
do
you
want
to
see
putney
for
what
for
why
doctor
on
account
of
putney
what
took
place
last
yes
what
was
that
what
was
why
his
strange
behaviour
his
his
was
he
intoxicated
did
you
think
so
why
you
were
there
doctor
did
you
think
so
annie
looked
at
him
with
as
much
astonishment
as
munger
the
doctor
laughed
again
you
ca
always
tell
when
putney
joking
a
great
joker
perhaps
he
was
oh
doctor
do
you
think
he
have
been
said
munger
with
clasped
hands
it
would
make
me
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
forgive
him
all
he
made
me
suffer
but
joking
doctor
you
ca
tell
when
people
are
joking
if
i
not
does
it
follow
that
really
intoxicated
oh
but
that
nonsense
morrell
that
mere
what
do
you
call
it
chop
logic
but
i
do
mind
it
i
grasp
at
a
munger
grasped
at
a
straw
of
the
mind
to
show
how
but
what
you
mean
well
putney
was
intoxicated
last
night
but
she
not
well
this
morning
i
afraid
she
could
see
just
as
you
doctor
cried
munger
with
mounting
cheerfulness
i
i
knew
just
how
much
you
meant
and
how
she
moved
closer
to
the
doctor
and
bent
a
look
of
candid
fondness
upon
him
but
i
know
you
trying
to
mystify
she
pursued
him
with
questions
which
he
easily
parried
smiling
and
laughing
at
the
end
she
left
him
to
annie
with
adieux
that
were
almost
radiant
anyhow
i
shall
take
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
if
putney
was
hoaxing
i
shall
not
give
myself
away
find
out
what
he
means
miss
kilburn
wo
you
she
took
hold
of
annie
unoffered
hand
and
pressed
it
in
a
double
leathern
grasp
and
ran
out
of
the
room
with
a
lightness
of
spirit
which
her
physical
bulk
imperfectly
expressed
xx
well
said
annie
to
the
change
which
came
over
morrell
face
when
munger
was
gone
oh
it
a
miserable
business
he
must
go
on
now
to
the
end
of
his
debauch
he
got
past
doing
any
mischief
i
thankful
to
say
but
i
had
hoped
to
tide
him
over
a
while
longer
and
now
that
fool
has
spoiled
everything
well
annie
heart
warmed
to
his
vexation
and
she
postponed
another
emotion
yes
she
a
fool
i
wish
you
had
qualified
the
term
they
looked
at
each
other
solemnly
and
then
laughed
it
wo
do
for
a
physician
to
swear
said
morrell
i
wish
you
give
me
a
cup
of
coffee
i
been
up
all
with
ralph
with
you
shall
have
it
instantly
that
is
as
instantly
as
bolton
can
kindle
up
a
fire
and
make
she
went
out
to
the
kitchen
and
gave
the
order
with
an
imperiousness
which
she
softened
in
morrell
interest
by
explaining
rather
fully
to
bolton
when
she
came
back
she
wanted
to
talk
seriously
tragically
about
putney
but
the
doctor
would
not
he
said
that
it
paid
to
sit
up
with
putney
drunk
or
sober
and
hear
him
go
on
he
repeated
some
things
putney
said
about
peck
about
gerrish
about
munger
but
why
did
you
try
to
put
her
off
in
that
way
to
make
her
believe
he
was
intoxicated
asked
annie
venting
her
postponed
emotion
which
was
of
disapproval
i
do
know
it
came
into
my
head
but
she
knows
it
was
rather
cruel
not
that
she
deserves
any
mercy
she
caught
so
at
the
oh
yes
i
saw
that
she
humbug
herself
with
it
and
you
see
that
before
night
there
be
two
theories
of
putney
escapade
i
think
the
last
will
be
the
popular
one
it
will
jump
with
the
general
opinion
of
putney
ability
to
carry
anything
out
and
munger
will
do
all
she
can
to
support
bolton
brought
in
the
and
annie
hesitated
a
moment
with
her
hand
on
it
before
pouring
out
a
cup
i
do
like
it
she
said
i
know
you
do
but
you
can
say
that
it
was
putney
who
hoaxed
munger
but
oh
you
did
either
of
you
hoax
well
then
there
no
harm
i
not
so
and
you
wo
give
me
any
coffee
oh
yes
i
give
you
some
said
annie
with
a
sigh
of
baffled
scrupulosity
that
made
them
both
laugh
he
broke
out
again
after
he
had
begun
to
drink
his
coffee
well
she
demanded
from
her
own
lapse
into
silence
oh
nothing
only
putney
he
wants
brother
peck
as
he
calls
him
to
unite
all
the
religious
elements
of
hatboro
in
a
church
of
his
own
and
send
out
missionaries
to
the
heathen
of
south
hatboro
to
preach
a
practical
christianity
he
makes
south
hatboro
stand
for
all
that
worldly
and
poor
ralph
is
that
the
way
he
talks
oh
not
all
the
time
he
talks
a
great
many
other
i
wonder
you
can
he
been
very
severe
on
brother
peck
for
neglecting
the
discipline
of
his
child
he
says
he
ought
to
remember
his
duty
to
others
and
save
the
community
from
having
the
child
grow
up
into
a
capricious
wilful
woman
putney
was
very
hard
upon
your
sex
miss
kilburn
he
attributed
nearly
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
women
wilfulness
and
he
looked
across
the
table
at
her
with
his
merry
eyes
whose
sweetness
she
felt
even
in
her
sudden
preoccupation
with
the
notion
which
she
now
launched
upon
him
leaning
forward
and
pushing
some
books
and
magazines
aside
as
if
she
wished
to
have
nothing
between
her
need
and
his
response
dr
morrell
what
should
you
think
of
my
asking
peck
to
give
me
his
little
girl
to
give
you
his
yes
let
me
take
idella
keep
her
adopt
her
i
nothing
to
do
as
you
know
very
well
and
she
be
an
occupation
and
it
would
be
far
better
for
her
what
ralph
says
is
true
she
growing
up
without
any
sort
of
training
and
i
think
if
she
keeps
on
she
will
be
mischievous
to
herself
and
every
one
really
asked
the
doctor
is
it
so
bad
as
that
of
course
not
and
of
course
i
do
want
peck
to
renounce
all
claim
to
his
child
but
to
let
me
have
her
for
the
present
or
indefinitely
and
get
her
some
decent
clothes
and
trim
her
hair
properly
and
give
her
some
sort
of
instruction
may
i
come
in
drawled
wilmington
mellow
voice
and
annie
turned
and
saw
lyra
peering
round
the
edge
of
the
library
door
been
discreetly
hemming
and
scraping
and
hammering
on
the
so
as
not
to
overhear
and
i
have
gone
away
if
i
had
been
afraid
of
being
oh
come
in
lyra
said
annie
and
she
hoped
that
she
had
kept
the
spirit
of
resignation
with
which
she
spoke
out
of
her
voice
morrell
jumped
up
with
an
apparent
desire
to
escape
that
wounded
and
exasperated
her
she
put
out
her
hand
quite
haughtily
to
him
and
asked
oh
must
you
go
yes
how
do
you
do
wilmington
you
better
get
miss
kilburn
to
give
you
a
cup
of
her
oh
i
will
said
lyra
she
forbore
any
reference
even
by
a
look
to
the
intimate
little
situation
she
had
disturbed
morrell
added
to
annie
i
like
your
plan
it
the
best
thing
you
could
she
found
she
had
been
keeping
his
hand
and
in
the
revulsion
from
wrath
to
joy
she
violently
wrung
it
i
glad
she
could
not
help
following
him
to
the
door
in
the
hope
that
he
would
say
something
more
but
he
did
not
and
she
could
only
repeat
her
rapturous
gratitude
in
several
forms
of
incoherency
she
ran
back
to
wilmington
lyra
what
do
you
think
of
my
taking
peck
little
girl
wilmington
never
allowed
herself
to
seem
surprised
at
anything
she
was
in
fact
surprised
at
very
few
things
she
had
got
into
the
easiest
chair
in
the
room
and
she
answered
from
it
with
a
luxurious
interest
in
the
affair
well
you
know
what
people
will
say
no
i
do
will
they
say
that
you
after
peck
pretty
annie
turned
scarlet
and
when
they
find
i
she
demanded
with
severity
that
had
no
effect
upon
lyra
then
they
say
you
could
get
they
may
say
what
they
please
what
do
you
think
of
the
plan
i
think
it
would
be
the
greatest
blessing
for
the
poor
little
thing
said
lyra
with
a
nearer
approach
to
seriousness
than
she
usually
made
and
the
greatest
care
for
you
she
added
after
a
moment
i
shall
not
care
for
the
care
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
thankful
for
it
cried
annie
fervidly
if
you
can
get
it
lyra
suggested
i
believe
i
can
get
it
i
believe
i
can
make
peck
see
that
it
a
duty
i
shall
ask
him
to
regard
it
as
a
charity
to
me
as
a
well
that
a
good
way
to
work
upon
peck
feelings
said
lyra
demurely
was
that
the
plan
that
morrell
approved
of
so
highly
i
did
know
but
it
was
some
course
of
treatment
you
pressed
his
hand
so
affectionately
i
said
to
myself
well
annie
either
an
enthusiastic
patient
or
else
what
demanded
annie
at
the
little
stop
lyra
made
well
you
know
what
people
do
what
why
that
you
very
much
out
of
health
or
lyra
made
another
of
her
tantalising
stops
or
what
or
morrell
is
very
much
in
lyra
i
ca
allow
you
to
say
such
things
to
no
that
what
i
kept
saying
to
myself
all
the
time
but
you
would
have
it
of
me
did
want
to
say
it
was
impossible
to
resist
lyra
pretended
deprecation
annie
laughed
i
suppose
i
ca
help
people
talking
and
i
ought
to
be
too
old
to
you
ought
but
you
not
said
lyra
flatteringly
well
annie
what
do
you
think
of
our
little
evening
at
munger
in
the
dim
retrospect
poor
ralph
what
did
the
doctor
say
about
him
she
listened
with
so
keen
a
relish
for
the
report
of
putney
sayings
that
annie
felt
as
if
she
had
been
turning
the
affair
into
comedy
for
lyra
amusement
oh
dear
i
wish
i
could
hear
him
i
thought
i
should
have
died
last
night
when
he
came
back
and
began
to
scare
everybody
blue
with
his
highly
personal
remarks
i
wish
he
had
time
to
get
round
to
the
lyra
said
annie
nerving
herself
to
the
office
do
you
think
it
was
wicked
to
treat
that
poor
girl
as
you
did
well
i
suppose
that
the
way
some
people
might
look
at
it
said
lyra
dispassionately
then
how
could
you
do
it
oh
it
easy
enough
to
behave
wickedly
annie
when
you
feel
like
it
said
lyra
much
amused
by
annie
fervour
apparently
besides
i
know
that
it
was
so
wicked
what
makes
you
think
it
was
oh
it
was
that
merely
lyra
may
i
i
speak
to
you
plainly
frankly
like
a
sister
annie
heart
filled
with
tenderness
for
lyra
with
the
wish
to
help
her
to
save
a
person
who
charmed
her
so
much
well
like
a
you
may
said
lyra
demurely
it
was
for
her
sake
alone
that
i
hated
to
see
it
it
was
for
your
sake
for
well
that
very
kind
of
you
annie
said
lyra
without
the
least
resentment
and
i
know
what
you
mean
but
it
really
does
hurt
either
jack
or
me
i
not
very
annie
i
do
pretend
to
be
but
i
not
very
either
i
assure
you
lyra
laughed
mischievously
i
one
of
the
very
few
persons
in
hatboro
who
are
better
than
they
should
i
know
it
lyra
i
know
it
but
you
have
no
right
to
keep
him
from
taking
a
fancy
to
some
young
girl
and
marrying
her
to
keep
him
to
yourself
to
make
people
there
something
in
that
lyra
assented
with
impartiality
but
i
think
it
would
be
well
for
jack
to
marry
yet
and
if
i
see
him
taking
a
fancy
to
any
real
nice
girl
i
interfere
with
him
but
i
shall
be
very
she
looked
at
annie
with
such
a
droll
mock
earnest
and
shook
her
head
with
such
a
burlesque
of
grandmotherly
solicitude
that
annie
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
oh
lyra
lyra
and
as
for
me
lyra
went
on
i
assure
you
i
do
care
for
the
little
bit
of
harm
it
does
but
you
ought
you
ought
cried
annie
you
ought
to
respect
yourself
enough
to
care
you
ought
to
respect
other
women
oh
i
guess
i
let
the
balance
of
the
sex
slide
annie
said
lyra
no
you
must
you
ca
we
are
all
bound
together
we
owe
everything
to
each
is
that
rather
peckish
lyra
suggested
i
do
know
but
it
true
lyra
and
i
should
be
ashamed
of
getting
it
from
oh
i
did
say
you
would
and
i
hope
you
wo
be
hurt
with
me
i
know
that
it
a
most
unwarrantable
thing
to
speak
to
you
about
such
a
matter
but
you
know
why
i
do
yes
i
suppose
it
because
you
like
me
and
i
appreciate
that
i
assure
you
lyra
was
soberer
than
she
had
yet
been
and
annie
felt
that
she
was
really
gaining
ground
and
your
husband
you
ought
to
respect
lyra
laughed
out
with
great
relish
oh
now
annie
you
joking
why
in
the
should
i
respect
wilmington
an
old
man
like
him
marrying
a
young
girl
like
me
she
jumped
up
and
laughed
at
the
look
in
annie
face
will
you
go
round
with
me
to
the
putneys
thought
ellen
might
like
to
see
no
no
i
ca
go
said
annie
finding
it
impossible
to
recover
at
once
from
the
quite
unanswerable
blow
her
sense
of
decorum
she
thought
it
her
moral
sense
had
received
well
you
be
glad
to
have
go
anyway
said
lyra
she
saw
annie
shrinking
from
her
and
she
took
hold
of
her
and
pulled
her
up
and
kissed
her
you
dear
old
thing
i
would
hurt
your
feelings
for
the
world
and
whichever
it
is
annie
the
parson
or
the
doctor
i
wish
him
that
afternoon
as
annie
was
walking
to
the
village
the
doctor
drove
up
to
the
sidewalk
and
stopped
near
her
miss
kilburn
i
got
a
letter
from
home
they
write
me
about
my
mother
in
a
way
that
makes
me
rather
anxious
and
i
shall
run
down
to
chelsea
this
oh
i
sorry
for
your
bad
news
i
hope
it
nothing
she
old
that
the
only
cause
for
anxiety
but
of
course
i
must
oh
yes
indeed
i
do
hope
you
find
all
right
with
thank
you
very
much
i
sorry
that
i
must
leave
putney
at
such
a
time
but
i
leave
him
with
peck
who
promised
to
be
with
him
i
thought
you
like
to
yes
i
do
it
very
kind
of
you
very
kind
thank
you
said
the
doctor
it
was
not
the
phrase
exactly
but
it
served
the
purpose
of
the
cordial
interest
in
which
they
parted
as
well
as
another
xxi
during
the
days
that
peck
had
consented
to
leave
idella
with
her
annie
took
the
whole
charge
of
the
child
and
grew
into
an
intimacy
with
her
that
was
very
sweet
it
was
not
necessary
to
this
that
idella
should
be
always
tractable
and
docile
which
she
was
not
but
only
that
she
should
be
affectionate
and
dependent
annie
found
that
she
even
liked
her
to
be
a
little
baddish
it
gave
her
something
to
forgive
and
she
experienced
a
perverse
pleasure
in
discovering
that
the
child
of
a
man
so
as
peck
was
rather
more
covetous
than
most
children
it
also
amused
her
that
when
some
of
idella
shabby
playmates
from
over
the
track
casually
found
their
way
to
the
woods
past
annie
house
and
tried
to
tempt
idella
to
go
with
them
the
child
disowned
them
and
ran
into
the
house
from
them
so
soon
was
she
alienated
from
her
former
life
by
her
present
social
advantages
she
apparently
distinguished
between
annie
and
the
boltons
or
if
not
quite
this
she
showed
a
distinct
preference
for
her
company
and
for
her
part
of
the
house
she
hung
about
annie
with
a
flattering
curiosity
and
interest
in
all
she
did
she
lost
every
trace
of
shyness
with
her
but
developed
an
intense
admiration
for
her
in
every
way
for
her
dresses
her
rings
her
laces
for
the
elegancies
that
marked
her
a
gentlewoman
she
pronounced
them
prettier
than
warner
things
and
the
house
prettier
and
larger
should
you
like
to
live
with
me
annie
asked
the
child
seemed
to
reflect
then
she
said
with
the
indirection
of
her
age
and
sex
pushing
against
annie
knee
i
do
know
what
your
name
have
you
never
heard
my
name
it
annie
how
do
you
like
it
it
it
too
short
said
the
child
from
her
readiness
always
to
answer
something
that
charmed
annie
well
then
you
can
make
it
longer
you
can
call
me
aunt
annie
i
think
that
will
be
better
for
a
little
girl
do
you
mothers
can
whip
but
aunts
ca
said
idella
bringing
a
practical
knowledge
acquired
from
her
observation
of
life
over
the
track
to
a
consideration
of
the
proposed
relation
i
know
aunt
who
wo
said
annie
touched
by
the
reply
saturday
evening
idella
father
came
for
her
and
with
a
preamble
which
seemed
to
have
been
unnecessary
when
he
understood
it
annie
asked
him
to
let
her
keep
the
child
at
least
till
he
had
settled
himself
in
a
house
of
his
own
or
she
hinted
in
some
way
more
comfortable
for
idella
than
he
was
now
living
in
her
anxiety
to
make
him
believe
that
she
was
not
taking
too
great
a
burden
on
her
hands
she
became
slowly
aware
that
no
fear
of
this
had
apparently
troubled
him
and
that
he
was
looking
at
the
whole
matter
from
a
point
outside
of
questions
of
polite
ceremonial
even
of
personal
feeling
she
was
vexed
a
little
with
his
insensibility
to
the
favour
she
meant
the
child
and
she
could
not
help
trying
to
make
him
realise
it
i
promise
always
to
be
the
best
guide
philosopher
and
friend
that
idella
could
have
she
took
this
light
tone
because
she
found
herself
afraid
of
him
but
i
think
i
shall
be
a
little
improvement
on
some
of
her
friends
over
the
track
at
least
if
she
wants
my
cat
she
shall
have
it
without
fighting
for
peck
looked
up
with
question
and
she
went
on
to
tell
him
of
a
struggle
which
she
had
seen
one
day
between
idella
and
a
small
irish
boy
for
a
kitten
it
really
belonged
to
the
boy
but
idella
carried
it
off
the
minister
listened
attentively
at
the
end
yes
he
said
that
lust
of
possession
is
something
all
but
impossible
even
with
constant
care
to
root
out
of
children
i
have
tried
to
teach
idella
that
nothing
is
rightfully
hers
except
while
she
can
use
it
but
it
is
hard
to
make
her
understand
and
when
she
is
with
other
children
she
annie
could
not
believe
at
first
that
he
was
serious
and
then
she
was
disposed
to
laugh
really
peck
she
began
i
ca
think
it
so
important
that
a
little
thing
like
idella
should
be
kept
from
coveting
a
kitten
as
that
she
should
be
kept
from
using
naughty
words
and
from
scratching
and
i
know
peck
consented
that
is
the
usual
way
of
looking
at
such
it
seems
to
me
said
annie
that
it
the
perhaps
but
upon
the
whole
i
do
agree
with
you
it
is
bad
for
the
child
to
use
naughty
words
and
to
scratch
and
bite
that
part
of
the
warfare
in
which
we
all
live
but
it
worse
for
her
to
covet
and
to
wish
to
keep
others
from
i
do
wonder
you
find
it
hard
to
make
her
understand
yes
it
hard
with
all
of
us
but
if
it
is
ever
to
be
easier
we
must
begin
with
the
he
was
silent
and
annie
did
not
say
anything
she
was
afraid
that
she
had
not
helped
her
cause
at
least
she
finally
ventured
you
ca
object
to
giving
idella
a
little
rest
from
the
fray
perhaps
if
she
finds
that
she
can
get
things
without
fighting
for
them
she
not
covet
them
so
yes
he
said
with
a
dim
smile
that
left
him
sad
again
there
is
some
truth
in
that
but
i
not
sure
that
i
have
the
right
to
give
her
advantages
of
any
kind
to
lift
her
above
the
lot
the
chance
of
the
least
fortunate
surely
we
are
bound
to
provide
for
those
of
our
own
household
said
annie
who
are
those
of
our
own
household
asked
the
minister
all
mankind
are
those
of
our
own
household
these
are
my
mother
and
my
brother
and
my
yes
i
know
said
annie
somewhat
eagerly
quitting
this
difficult
ground
but
you
can
leave
her
with
me
at
least
till
you
get
settled
she
faltered
if
you
do
wish
it
to
be
for
perhaps
it
may
not
be
for
long
he
answered
if
you
mean
my
settlement
in
hatboro
i
doubt
he
continued
lifting
his
eyes
to
the
question
in
hers
whether
i
shall
remain
oh
i
hope
you
will
cried
annie
she
thought
she
must
make
a
pretence
of
misunderstanding
him
i
supposed
you
were
very
much
satisfied
with
your
work
i
am
not
satisfied
with
myself
in
my
work
replied
the
minister
and
i
know
that
i
am
far
from
acceptable
to
many
others
in
you
are
acceptable
to
those
who
are
best
able
to
appreciate
you
peck
she
protested
and
to
people
of
every
kind
i
sure
it
only
a
question
of
time
when
you
will
be
thoroughly
acceptable
to
all
i
want
you
to
understand
peck
she
added
that
i
was
shocked
and
ashamed
the
other
night
at
your
being
tricked
into
countenancing
a
part
of
the
entertainment
you
were
promised
should
be
dropped
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
was
very
unimportant
after
all
the
minister
said
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
in
fact
i
was
interested
to
see
the
experiment
of
bringing
the
different
grades
of
society
it
seems
to
me
it
was
an
utter
failure
suggested
annie
quite
but
it
was
what
i
there
appeared
an
uncandour
in
this
which
annie
could
not
let
pass
even
if
it
imperilled
her
present
object
to
bring
up
the
matter
of
past
contention
but
when
we
first
talked
of
the
social
union
you
opposed
it
because
it
would
bring
the
different
classes
did
you
understand
that
then
i
failed
to
make
myself
clear
i
wished
merely
to
argue
that
the
ladies
who
suggested
it
were
not
intending
a
social
union
at
all
in
fact
such
a
union
in
our
present
condition
of
things
with
its
division
of
classes
is
impossible
as
munger
experiment
showed
with
the
best
will
on
both
sides
but
as
i
said
the
experiment
was
interesting
though
unimportant
except
as
it
resulted
in
and
they
were
on
the
same
ground
but
they
had
reached
it
from
so
opposite
that
annie
felt
it
very
unsafe
in
her
fear
of
getting
into
some
controversy
with
peck
that
might
interfere
with
her
designs
regarding
idella
she
had
a
little
insincerity
in
saying
mrs
bad
faith
in
that
was
certainly
unimportant
compared
with
her
part
in
poor
putney
misfortune
that
was
the
worst
thing
that
what
i
peck
said
nothing
to
this
and
annie
somewhat
daunted
by
his
silence
proceeded
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
telling
her
what
i
thought
on
both
points
but
ralph
putney
i
hear
has
escaped
this
time
with
less
than
his
usual
she
did
not
know
what
word
to
use
for
spree
and
so
she
stopped
peck
merely
said
he
has
shown
great
and
she
perceived
that
he
was
not
going
to
say
more
he
listened
patiently
to
the
reasons
she
gave
for
not
having
offered
putney
anything
more
than
passive
sympathy
at
a
time
when
help
could
only
have
cumbered
and
kindness
wounded
her
but
he
made
no
sign
of
thinking
them
either
necessary
or
sufficient
in
the
meantime
he
had
not
formally
consented
to
idella
remaining
with
her
and
annie
prepared
to
lead
back
to
that
affair
as
artfully
as
she
could
i
really
want
you
to
believe
peck
that
i
think
very
differently
on
points
from
what
i
did
when
we
first
talked
about
the
social
union
and
i
have
you
to
thank
for
seeing
things
in
a
new
light
and
you
need
she
added
lightly
be
afraid
of
my
contaminating
idella
mind
with
any
wicked
ideas
i
do
my
best
to
keep
her
from
coveting
kittens
or
property
of
any
kind
though
i
always
heard
my
father
say
that
civilisation
was
founded
upon
the
instinct
of
ownership
and
that
it
was
the
only
thing
that
had
advanced
the
world
and
if
you
dread
the
danger
of
giving
her
advantages
as
you
say
or
bettering
her
worldly
lot
she
continued
with
a
smile
for
his
quixotic
scruples
why
i
do
my
best
to
reduce
her
blessings
to
a
minimum
though
i
do
see
why
the
poor
little
thing
should
get
some
good
from
the
inequalities
that
there
always
must
be
in
the
i
am
not
sure
there
always
must
be
inequalities
in
the
world
answered
the
minister
there
always
have
been
cried
annie
there
always
had
been
slavery
up
to
a
certain
time
he
replied
oh
but
surely
you
do
compare
the
two
annie
pleaded
with
what
she
really
regarded
as
a
kind
of
lunacy
in
the
good
man
in
the
freest
society
i
heard
my
father
say
there
is
naturally
an
upward
and
downward
tendency
a
perfect
level
is
impossible
some
must
rise
and
some
must
but
what
do
you
mean
by
rising
if
you
mean
in
material
things
in
wealth
and
the
power
over
others
that
it
gives
i
do
mean
that
altogether
but
there
are
other
ways
in
cultivation
refinement
higher
tastes
and
aims
than
the
great
mass
of
people
can
have
you
have
risen
yourself
i
have
risen
as
you
call
it
he
said
with
a
meek
sufferance
of
the
application
of
the
point
to
himself
those
who
rise
above
the
necessity
of
work
for
daily
bread
are
in
great
danger
of
losing
their
right
relation
to
other
men
as
i
said
when
we
talked
of
this
a
point
had
remained
in
annie
mind
from
her
first
talk
with
morrell
yes
and
you
said
once
that
there
could
be
no
sympathy
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
no
real
love
because
they
had
not
had
the
same
experience
of
life
but
how
is
it
about
the
poor
who
become
rich
they
have
had
the
same
too
often
they
make
haste
to
forget
that
they
were
poor
they
become
hard
masters
to
those
they
have
left
behind
them
they
are
eager
to
identify
themselves
with
those
who
have
been
rich
longer
than
they
some
who
now
see
this
clearly
have
the
courage
to
refuse
to
rise
miss
kilburn
why
should
i
let
you
take
my
child
out
of
the
conditions
of
and
to
which
she
was
born
i
do
know
said
annie
rather
blankly
then
she
added
impetuously
because
i
love
her
and
want
her
i
do
i
pretend
that
it
for
her
sake
it
for
sake
though
i
can
take
better
care
of
her
than
you
can
but
i
all
alone
in
the
world
i
neither
kith
nor
kin
nothing
but
my
miserable
money
i
set
my
heart
on
the
child
i
must
have
her
at
least
let
me
keep
her
a
while
i
will
be
honest
with
you
peck
if
i
find
i
doing
her
harm
and
not
good
i
give
her
up
i
should
wish
you
to
feel
that
she
is
yours
as
much
as
ever
and
if
you
feel
so
and
come
often
to
see
her
i
i
shall
be
very
glad
and
she
stopped
and
peck
rose
where
is
the
child
he
asked
with
a
troubled
air
and
she
silently
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
and
left
him
at
the
door
to
idella
and
the
boltons
when
she
ventured
back
later
he
was
gone
but
the
child
remained
half
exultant
and
half
ashamed
she
promised
herself
that
she
really
would
be
true
as
far
as
possible
to
the
odd
notions
of
the
minister
in
her
treatment
of
his
child
when
she
undressed
idella
for
bed
she
noticed
again
the
shabbiness
of
her
poor
little
clothes
she
went
through
the
bureau
that
held
her
own
childish
things
once
more
but
found
them
all
too
large
for
idella
and
too
hopelessly
antiquated
she
said
to
herself
that
on
this
point
at
least
she
must
be
a
law
to
herself
she
went
down
to
see
bolton
is
there
some
place
in
the
village
where
they
have
children
clothes
for
sale
she
asked
mr
gerrish
said
bolton
briefly
annie
shook
her
head
drawing
in
her
breath
i
should
want
to
go
there
is
there
nowhere
else
there
a
jew
place
they
say
he
i
dare
say
he
does
cheat
more
than
most
christians
said
annie
jumping
from
her
chair
i
try
the
jew
place
i
want
you
to
come
with
me
they
went
together
and
found
a
dress
that
they
both
decided
would
fit
idella
and
a
hat
that
matched
it
i
do
know
as
he
like
to
have
anything
quite
so
nice
said
bolton
coldly
i
do
know
as
he
has
anything
to
say
about
it
said
annie
mimicking
bolton
accent
and
syntax
they
both
meant
peck
bolton
turned
away
to
hide
her
pleasure
in
annie
audacity
and
extravagance
want
i
should
carry
she
asked
when
they
were
out
of
the
store
no
i
can
carry
them
said
annie
she
put
them
where
idella
must
see
them
as
soon
as
she
woke
it
was
late
before
she
slept
and
idella
voice
broke
upon
her
dreams
the
child
was
sitting
up
in
her
bed
gloating
upon
the
dress
and
hat
hung
and
perched
upon
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
oh
whose
is
it
whose
is
it
whose
is
it
she
screamed
and
as
annie
lifted
herself
on
her
elbow
and
looked
over
at
her
is
it
mine
is
it
mine
annie
had
thought
of
playing
some
joke
of
pretending
not
to
understand
of
delaying
the
child
pleasure
playing
with
it
teasing
but
in
the
face
of
this
rapturous
longing
she
could
only
answer
mine
my
very
own
to
have
to
keep
always
idella
sprang
from
her
bed
and
flew
upon
the
things
with
a
primitive
greedy
transport
in
their
possession
she
could
scarcely
be
held
long
enough
to
be
washed
before
the
dress
could
be
put
on
be
careful
be
careful
not
to
get
it
soiled
now
said
annie
no
i
wo
spoil
she
went
quietly
downstairs
and
when
annie
followed
she
found
her
posing
before
the
long
in
the
parlour
and
twisting
and
turning
for
this
effect
and
that
all
the
morning
she
moved
about
prim
and
anxious
the
flower
was
like
a
blossom
wired
for
a
bouquet
at
the
church
door
she
asked
idella
would
you
rather
sit
with
bolton
no
no
gasped
the
child
intensely
with
and
she
pushed
her
hand
into
annie
and
held
fast
to
it
annie
question
had
been
suggested
by
a
belated
reluctance
to
appear
before
so
much
of
hatboro
in
charge
of
the
minister
child
but
now
she
could
not
retreat
and
with
idella
hand
in
hers
she
advanced
blushing
up
the
aisle
to
her
pew
xxii
the
farmers
filled
the
long
shed
beside
the
church
and
their
leathern
faces
looked
up
with
their
wives
and
children
at
peck
where
he
sat
high
behind
the
pulpit
a
patient
expectance
suggested
itself
in
the
men
bald
or
grizzled
crowns
and
in
the
fantastic
hats
and
bonnets
of
their
women
folks
the
village
ladies
were
all
in
the
perfection
of
their
street
costumes
and
they
compared
well
with
three
or
four
of
the
ladies
from
south
hatboro
but
the
men
with
them
spoiled
all
by
the
inadequacy
of
their
fashion
gates
the
second
of
her
name
was
very
stylish
but
the
had
honestly
the
effect
of
having
got
for
the
day
only
into
the
black
coat
which
he
had
bought
for
his
first
wife
funeral
wilmington
who
appeared
much
shorter
than
his
wife
as
he
sat
beside
her
was
as
much
inferior
to
her
in
dress
he
wore
with
the
carelessness
of
a
rich
man
who
could
afford
simplicity
a
loose
alpaca
coat
and
a
cambric
neckcloth
over
which
he
twisted
his
shrivelled
neck
to
catch
sight
of
annie
as
she
rustled
up
the
aisle
gerrish
so
much
as
could
be
seen
of
her
was
a
mound
of
bugled
velvet
topped
by
a
small
bonnet
which
seemed
to
have
gone
much
to
a
fat
black
pompon
she
sat
far
within
her
pew
and
their
children
stretched
in
a
row
from
her
side
to
that
of
gerrish
next
the
door
he
did
not
look
round
at
annie
but
kept
an
attitude
of
fixed
in
harmony
with
the
severe
respectability
of
his
dress
his
wife
leaned
well
forward
to
see
and
let
all
her
censure
appear
in
her
eyes
colonel
marvin
of
the
largest
showed
the
side
of
his
large
florid
face
with
the
kindly
smile
that
seemed
to
hang
loosely
upon
it
and
there
was
a
good
number
of
the
and
hands
of
different
ages
and
sexes
scattered
about
the
gallery
commonly
empty
or
almost
so
showed
groups
and
single
figures
dropped
about
here
and
there
on
its
seats
the
putneys
were
in
their
pew
the
little
lame
boy
between
the
father
and
mother
as
their
custom
was
they
each
looked
up
at
her
as
she
passed
and
smiled
in
the
slight
measure
of
recognition
which
people
permit
themselves
in
church
putney
was
sitting
with
his
head
hanging
forward
in
pathetic
dejection
his
face
when
he
first
lifted
it
to
look
at
annie
in
passing
was
haggard
but
otherwise
there
was
no
consciousness
in
it
of
what
had
passed
since
they
had
sat
there
the
sunday
before
when
his
glance
took
in
idella
too
in
her
sudden
finery
a
light
of
friendly
mocking
came
into
it
and
seemed
to
comment
the
relation
annie
had
assumed
to
the
child
annie
pew
was
just
in
front
of
lyra
and
lyra
pursed
her
mouth
in
burlesque
surprise
as
annie
got
into
it
with
idella
and
turned
round
to
lift
the
child
to
the
seat
while
peck
was
giving
out
the
hymn
lyra
leaned
forward
and
whispered
do
imagine
that
this
turnout
is
on
your
account
annie
going
to
preach
against
the
social
union
and
the
social
the
banter
echoed
a
mechanical
expectation
in
annie
heart
which
was
probably
present
in
many
others
there
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
cast
it
out
even
after
he
had
taken
his
text
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
and
she
followed
him
with
a
mechanical
disappointment
at
his
failure
to
meet
it
he
began
by
saying
that
he
wished
to
dissociate
his
text
in
his
minds
from
the
scent
of
the
upturned
earth
and
the
fall
of
clods
upon
the
coffin
lid
and
he
asked
them
to
join
him
in
attempting
to
find
in
it
another
meaning
beside
that
which
it
usually
carried
he
believed
that
those
words
of
christ
ought
to
speak
to
us
of
this
world
as
well
as
the
next
and
enjoin
upon
us
the
example
which
we
might
all
find
in
him
as
well
as
promise
us
immortality
with
him
as
the
minister
went
on
annie
followed
him
with
the
interest
which
her
belief
that
she
heard
between
the
words
inspired
and
occasionally
in
a
discontent
with
what
seemed
a
mystical
almost
a
fantastical
quality
of
his
thought
there
is
an
evolution
he
continued
in
the
moral
as
well
as
in
the
material
world
and
good
unfolds
in
greater
good
that
which
was
once
best
ceases
to
be
in
that
which
is
better
in
the
political
world
we
have
striven
forward
to
liberty
as
to
the
final
good
but
with
this
achieved
we
find
that
liberty
is
only
a
means
and
not
an
end
and
that
we
shall
abuse
it
as
a
means
if
we
do
not
use
it
even
sacrifice
it
to
promote
equality
or
in
other
words
equality
is
the
perfect
work
the
evolution
of
liberty
patriotism
has
been
the
virtue
which
has
secured
an
image
of
brotherhood
rude
and
imperfect
to
large
numbers
of
men
within
certain
limits
but
nationality
must
perish
before
the
universal
ideal
of
fraternity
is
realised
charity
is
the
holiest
of
the
agencies
which
have
hitherto
wrought
to
redeem
the
race
from
savagery
and
despair
but
there
is
something
holier
yet
than
charity
something
higher
something
purer
and
further
from
selfishness
something
into
which
charity
shall
willingly
grow
and
cease
and
that
is
not
the
justice
of
our
christless
codes
with
their
penalties
but
the
instinct
of
righteous
shame
which
however
dumbly
however
obscurely
stirs
in
every
honest
man
heart
when
his
superfluity
is
confronted
with
another
destitution
and
which
is
destined
to
increase
in
power
till
it
becomes
the
social
as
well
as
the
individual
conscience
then
in
the
truly
christian
state
there
shall
be
no
more
asking
and
no
more
giving
no
more
gratitude
and
no
more
merit
no
more
charity
but
only
and
evermore
justice
all
shall
share
alike
and
want
and
luxury
and
killing
toil
and
heartless
indolence
shall
all
cease
together
it
is
in
the
spirit
of
this
justice
that
i
believe
christ
shall
come
to
judge
the
world
not
to
condemn
and
punish
so
much
as
to
reconcile
and
to
right
we
live
in
an
age
of
seeming
preparation
for
indefinite
war
the
lines
are
drawn
harder
and
faster
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
on
either
side
the
forces
are
embattled
the
are
combined
in
vast
organisations
to
withstand
the
strength
of
the
capitalists
and
these
are
taking
the
lesson
and
uniting
in
trusts
the
smaller
industries
are
gone
and
the
smaller
commerce
is
being
devoured
by
the
larger
where
many
little
shops
existed
one
huge
factory
assembles
manufacture
one
large
store
in
which
many
different
branches
of
trade
are
united
swallows
up
the
small
dealers
yet
in
the
labour
organisations
which
have
their
bad
side
their
weak
side
through
which
the
forces
of
hell
enter
i
see
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
poor
have
at
last
had
pity
on
the
poor
and
will
no
more
betray
and
underbid
and
desert
one
another
but
will
stand
and
fall
together
as
brothers
and
the
monopolies
though
they
are
founded
upon
ruin
though
they
know
no
pity
and
no
relenting
have
a
final
significance
which
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
they
prophesy
the
end
of
competition
one
element
of
strife
of
rivalry
of
warfare
but
woe
to
them
through
whose
evil
this
good
comes
to
any
man
who
prospers
on
to
ease
and
fortune
forgetful
or
ignorant
of
the
ruin
on
which
his
success
is
built
for
that
death
the
resurrection
and
the
life
seem
not
to
be
whatever
his
creed
or
his
religious
profession
his
state
is
more
pitiable
than
that
of
the
sceptic
whose
words
perhaps
deny
christ
but
whose
works
affirm
him
there
has
been
much
anxiety
in
the
church
for
the
future
of
the
world
abandoned
to
the
godlessness
of
science
but
i
can
not
share
it
if
god
is
nothing
exists
but
from
him
he
directs
the
very
reason
that
questions
him
and
christ
rises
anew
in
the
doubt
of
him
that
the
sins
of
christendom
inspire
so
far
from
dreading
such
misgiving
as
comes
from
contemplating
the
disparity
between
the
church
profession
and
her
performance
i
welcome
it
as
another
resurrection
and
a
new
the
minister
paused
and
seemed
about
to
resume
when
a
scuffling
and
knocking
noise
drew
all
eyes
toward
the
pew
of
the
gerrish
family
gerrish
had
risen
and
flung
open
the
door
so
sharply
that
it
struck
against
the
of
the
pew
and
he
stood
pulling
his
children
whom
gerrish
urged
from
behind
one
after
another
into
the
aisle
beside
him
one
of
them
had
been
asleep
and
he
now
gave
way
to
the
alarm
which
seizes
a
small
boy
suddenly
awakened
his
mother
tried
to
still
him
stooping
over
him
and
twitching
him
by
the
hand
with
repeated
sh
as
mothers
do
till
her
husband
got
her
before
him
and
marched
his
family
down
the
aisle
and
out
of
the
door
the
noise
of
their
feet
over
the
floor
of
the
vestibule
died
away
upon
the
stone
steps
outside
the
minister
allowed
the
pause
he
had
made
to
prolong
itself
painfully
he
wavered
after
clearing
his
throat
as
if
to
go
on
with
his
sermon
and
then
he
said
sadly
let
us
pray
xxiii
putney
stopped
with
his
wife
and
boy
and
waited
for
annie
at
the
corner
of
the
street
where
their
ways
parted
she
had
eluded
lyra
wilmington
in
coming
down
the
aisle
and
she
had
hurried
to
escape
the
sensation
which
broke
into
eager
talk
among
the
people
before
they
got
out
of
church
and
which
began
with
question
whether
one
of
the
gerrish
children
was
sick
and
ended
in
the
more
satisfactory
conviction
that
gerrish
was
offended
at
something
in
the
sermon
well
annie
said
putney
with
a
satirical
smile
oh
ralph
ellen
what
does
it
mean
it
means
that
brother
gerrish
thought
peck
was
hitting
at
him
in
that
talk
about
the
large
commerce
and
it
means
business
said
putney
brother
gerrish
has
made
a
beginning
and
i
guess
it
the
beginning
of
the
end
unless
we
all
ready
to
take
hold
against
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
do
anything
everything
it
was
abominable
it
was
atrocious
she
shuddered
out
with
disgust
how
could
he
imagine
that
peck
would
do
such
a
thing
well
he
imagined
it
but
he
does
mean
to
stay
out
of
church
he
means
to
put
brother
peck
we
must
let
him
that
would
be
that
the
way
ellen
and
i
feel
about
it
said
putney
but
we
do
know
how
much
of
a
party
there
is
with
but
everybody
everybody
must
feel
the
same
way
about
behaviour
i
do
see
how
you
can
be
so
quiet
about
it
you
and
ellen
annie
looked
from
one
to
another
indignantly
and
putney
laughed
we
not
quietly
about
it
said
putney
putney
took
out
a
piece
of
tobacco
and
bit
off
a
large
corner
and
began
to
chew
vehemently
upon
it
hello
idella
he
said
to
the
little
girl
holding
by
annie
hand
and
looking
up
intently
at
him
with
childish
interest
in
what
he
was
eating
what
a
pretty
dress
you
got
on
it
mine
said
the
child
to
is
that
so
well
it
a
i
going
to
wear
it
all
the
is
that
so
well
now
you
and
winthrop
step
on
ahead
a
little
i
want
to
see
how
you
look
in
it
splendid
he
said
as
she
took
the
boy
hand
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
for
putney
applause
lyra
tells
us
adopted
her
for
the
time
being
annie
i
guess
you
have
your
hands
full
but
as
i
was
going
to
say
about
feeling
differently
my
experience
is
that
there
always
a
party
for
the
perverse
simply
because
it
seems
to
answer
a
need
in
human
nature
there
a
fascination
in
it
a
man
feels
as
if
there
must
be
something
in
it
besides
the
perversity
and
because
it
so
obviously
wrong
it
must
be
right
do
you
believe
but
what
a
good
half
of
the
people
in
church
are
pretty
sure
that
gerrish
had
a
good
reason
for
behaving
indecently
the
very
fact
that
he
did
so
carries
conviction
to
some
minds
and
those
are
the
minds
we
have
got
to
deal
with
when
he
gets
up
in
the
next
society
meeting
there
a
mighty
great
danger
that
he
have
a
strong
party
to
back
i
ca
believe
it
annie
broke
out
but
she
was
greatly
troubled
what
do
you
think
ellen
that
there
any
danger
of
his
carrying
the
day
against
peck
there
a
great
deal
of
dissatisfaction
with
peck
already
you
know
and
i
guess
ralph
right
about
the
rest
of
well
i
glad
i
taken
a
pew
i
with
you
for
peck
ralph
heart
and
as
brother
brandreth
says
about
the
social
union
well
that
right
i
shall
count
upon
you
and
speaking
of
the
social
union
i
have
seen
you
annie
since
that
night
at
munger
i
suppose
you
do
expect
me
to
say
anything
in
no
ralph
and
you
need
defended
you
sufficiently
justified
that
wo
do
said
putney
ellen
and
i
have
thought
that
all
out
and
we
find
that
i
or
something
that
stood
for
me
was
to
blame
whoever
else
was
to
blame
too
we
wo
mention
the
hospitable
munger
when
morrell
had
to
go
away
brother
peck
took
hold
with
me
and
he
suggested
good
resolutions
i
told
him
i
tried
and
they
never
did
me
the
least
good
but
his
sort
really
seemed
to
work
i
do
know
whether
they
would
work
again
ellen
thinks
they
would
think
we
ever
need
anything
again
but
that
what
i
always
think
when
i
come
out
of
it
like
a
man
with
chills
and
it
was
morrell
who
asked
peck
to
come
said
putney
and
it
turned
out
for
the
best
ralph
got
well
quicker
than
he
ever
did
before
of
course
annie
she
explained
it
must
seem
strange
to
you
hearing
us
talk
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
disease
but
that
just
like
what
it
is
a
raging
disease
and
i
ca
feel
differently
about
anything
that
happens
in
it
though
i
do
blame
people
for
annie
followed
with
tender
interest
the
loving
pride
that
exonerated
and
idealised
putney
in
the
words
of
the
woman
who
had
suffered
so
much
with
him
and
must
suffer
i
could
help
speaking
as
i
did
to
she
deserved
it
every
word
said
annie
i
wonder
you
did
say
oh
hold
on
putney
interposed
we
allow
that
the
local
influences
were
malarial
but
i
guess
we
ca
excuse
the
invalid
altogether
brother
peck
view
and
i
must
say
i
found
it
decidedly
tonic
it
helped
to
brace
me
i
think
he
was
too
severe
with
you
altogether
said
his
wife
putney
laughed
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
ellen
from
getting
up
and
going
out
of
church
too
when
brother
gerrish
set
the
example
she
a
gerrishite
at
well
remember
ralph
said
annie
that
i
with
you
in
whatever
you
do
to
defeat
that
man
it
a
good
cause
a
righteous
cause
the
cause
of
justice
and
we
must
do
everything
for
it
she
said
fervently
yes
any
enormity
is
justifiable
against
injustice
he
suggested
or
the
unjust
it
the
same
you
know
i
do
mean
that
i
can
trust
i
shall
keep
within
the
law
at
any
rate
said
putney
well
bolton
annie
called
out
when
she
entered
her
house
and
she
pushed
on
into
the
kitchen
she
had
not
the
patience
to
wait
for
her
to
bring
in
the
dinner
before
speaking
about
the
exciting
event
at
church
but
bolton
would
not
be
led
up
to
the
subject
by
a
tacit
invitation
and
after
a
suspense
in
which
her
zeal
for
peck
began
to
take
a
colour
of
resentment
toward
bolton
annie
demanded
what
do
you
think
of
gerrish
scandalous
behaviour
bolton
gave
herself
time
to
put
a
stick
of
wood
into
the
stove
and
to
punch
it
with
the
handle
before
answering
i
do
know
as
anything
more
than
i
annie
went
on
it
was
shameful
do
you
suppose
he
really
thought
peck
was
referring
to
him
in
his
sermon
i
presume
he
felt
the
cap
fit
but
if
it
had
one
thing
another
peck
was
bound
to
roil
the
brook
for
drinkin
wherever
he
stood
up
stream
or
yes
he
a
wolf
a
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
said
annie
excitedly
i
as
you
can
call
him
a
exactly
returned
bolton
dryly
he
got
his
good
points
i
annie
was
astounded
why
bolton
you
surely
not
going
to
justify
him
bolton
erected
herself
from
cutting
a
loaf
of
her
best
bread
into
slices
and
stood
with
the
knife
in
her
hand
like
a
figure
of
justice
well
i
you
no
need
to
ask
me
a
question
like
that
miss
kilburn
i
hai
obliged
to
make
up
to
peck
though
for
what
i
done
in
the
beginnin
by
condemnin
everybuddy
else
without
mercy
bolton
eyes
did
not
flash
fire
but
they
sent
out
an
icy
gleam
that
went
as
sharply
to
annie
heart
bolton
came
in
from
feeding
the
horse
and
cow
in
the
barn
with
a
mealy
tin
pan
in
his
hand
from
which
came
a
mild
subdued
radiance
like
that
of
his
countenance
he
was
not
sensible
of
arriving
upon
a
dramatic
moment
and
he
said
without
noticing
the
attitude
of
either
lady
i
see
you
walkin
home
with
putney
miss
kilburn
what
say
you
mean
about
gerrish
he
thinks
as
we
all
do
that
it
was
a
challenge
to
peck
friends
and
that
we
must
take
it
a
light
of
melancholy
satisfaction
shone
from
bolton
deeply
shaded
eyes
well
he
ai
one
to
lose
time
not
a
great
deal
i
presume
he
goin
to
work
at
once
said
annie
he
says
gerrish
will
be
sure
to
bring
his
grievance
up
at
the
next
society
meeting
and
we
must
be
ready
to
meet
him
and
him
and
she
reported
these
phrases
from
putney
lips
well
i
guess
if
it
was
putney
would
have
much
trouble
about
it
and
as
far
forth
as
votin
goes
i
do
believe
but
what
we
can
carry
the
we
could
said
bolton
from
the
pantry
where
she
had
gone
to
put
the
bread
away
in
its
stone
jar
if
it
was
left
to
the
she
accented
the
last
word
with
the
click
of
the
jar
lid
and
came
out
well
it
ai
a
church
question
it
a
society
bolton
replied
on
her
passage
to
the
with
the
plate
of
sliced
bread
i
ca
make
it
seem
right
to
have
the
minister
a
society
question
seems
to
me
that
the
church
members
ought
have
the
well
you
ca
make
the
discipline
over
to
suit
everybody
said
bolton
i
presume
it
was
ordered
for
a
wise
why
land
alive
oliver
bolton
his
wife
shouted
back
from
the
remoteness
to
which
his
words
had
followed
her
the
statute
provisions
and
rules
of
the
society
ordered
by
well
not
directly
as
you
may
say
said
bolton
beginning
high
and
lowering
his
voice
as
she
rejoined
them
but
i
presume
the
hearts
of
them
that
made
them
was
bolton
could
not
combat
a
position
of
such
unimpregnable
piety
in
words
but
she
permitted
herself
a
contemptuous
sniff
and
went
on
getting
the
things
into
the
and
i
guess
it
all
goin
to
work
together
for
good
i
ai
afraid
any
but
what
it
goin
to
come
out
all
right
but
we
got
to
be
up
and
doin
as
they
say
about
times
the
lord
helps
them
that
helps
themselves
said
bolton
and
then
as
if
he
felt
the
weakness
of
this
position
as
compared
with
that
of
entire
trust
in
providence
he
winked
his
mild
eyes
and
added
if
they
on
the
right
side
and
put
their
faith
in
his
well
your
dinner
ready
now
bolton
said
to
annie
idella
had
clung
fast
to
annie
hand
as
annie
started
toward
the
she
got
before
her
and
whispered
vehemently
what
asked
annie
bending
down
she
laughed
in
lifting
her
head
i
promised
idella
you
let
us
have
some
preserves
bolton
smiled
with
grim
pleasure
i
see
all
the
while
her
mind
was
set
on
something
she
ai
one
to
let
you
forget
promises
well
i
guess
if
peck
had
a
little
more
of
disposition
there
would
be
much
doubt
about
the
way
it
would
all
come
well
you
do
often
see
pairents
take
after
their
children
said
bolton
venturing
a
small
joke
no
nor
husbands
after
their
wives
either
said
bolton
sharply
the
more
the
xxiv
morrell
came
to
see
annie
late
the
next
wednesday
evening
i
did
know
you
come
back
she
said
she
returned
to
the
from
which
she
came
forward
to
greet
him
and
he
dropped
into
an
easy
seat
near
the
table
piled
with
books
and
sewing
i
did
know
it
myself
half
an
hour
really
and
is
this
your
first
visit
i
must
be
a
very
interesting
you
are
always
how
have
you
been
i
i
hardly
know
whether
i
been
at
all
she
answered
in
mechanical
parody
of
his
own
reply
so
many
other
things
have
been
of
so
much
more
she
let
her
eyes
rest
full
upon
his
with
a
sense
of
returning
comfort
and
safety
in
his
presence
and
after
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
she
asked
how
did
you
leave
your
mother
very
much
better
entirely
out
of
it
so
odd
to
think
of
any
one
having
a
family
to
me
it
seems
the
normal
condition
not
to
have
any
well
we
ca
very
well
dispense
with
mothers
said
the
doctor
we
have
to
begin
with
them
at
any
oh
i
do
object
to
them
i
only
wonder
at
they
fell
into
a
cosy
and
mutually
interesting
talk
about
their
separate
past
and
he
gave
her
glimpses
of
the
life
simple
and
studious
he
had
led
before
he
went
abroad
she
confessed
to
two
mistakes
in
which
she
had
mechanically
persisted
concerning
him
one
that
he
came
from
charlestown
instead
of
chelsea
and
the
other
that
his
first
name
was
joseph
instead
of
james
she
did
not
own
that
she
had
always
thought
it
odd
he
should
be
willing
to
remain
in
a
place
like
hatboro
and
that
it
must
argue
a
strangely
unambitious
temperament
in
a
man
of
his
ability
she
diverted
the
impulse
to
a
general
satire
of
village
life
and
ended
by
saying
that
she
was
getting
to
be
a
perfect
villager
herself
he
laughed
and
then
how
has
hatboro
been
getting
along
he
asked
simply
seething
with
excitement
she
answered
but
i
should
hardly
know
where
to
begin
if
i
tried
to
tell
you
she
added
it
seems
such
an
age
since
i
saw
thank
you
said
the
doctor
i
did
mean
to
be
so
flattering
but
you
have
certainly
marked
an
epoch
really
i
know
where
to
begin
i
wish
seen
somebody
else
first
ralph
and
ellen
or
i
might
go
and
see
them
no
stay
now
you
here
though
i
know
i
shall
not
do
justice
to
the
but
she
was
able
to
possess
him
of
it
with
impartiality
even
with
a
little
humour
all
the
more
because
she
was
at
heart
intensely
partisan
and
serious
no
one
knows
what
gerrish
intends
to
do
next
he
has
kept
quietly
about
his
business
and
he
told
some
of
the
ladies
who
tried
to
interview
him
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
talk
about
the
course
he
had
taken
he
does
seem
to
be
ashamed
of
his
behaviour
and
ralph
thinks
that
he
either
satisfied
with
it
and
intends
to
let
it
stand
as
a
protest
or
else
he
going
to
strike
another
blow
on
the
next
business
meeting
but
he
even
kept
gerrish
quiet
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
unite
peck
friends
provisionally
ralph
devoted
himself
to
that
and
he
says
he
has
talked
hours
to
the
day
ever
is
he
yes
perfectly
i
could
hardly
believe
it
when
i
saw
him
at
church
on
sunday
it
was
like
seeing
one
risen
from
the
dead
what
he
must
have
gone
through
and
ellen
she
told
me
how
peck
had
helped
him
in
the
struggle
she
attributes
everything
to
him
but
of
course
you
think
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
makes
you
think
that
he
asked
oh
i
do
know
would
that
naturally
be
the
attitude
of
science
toward
religion
perhaps
but
i
not
science
with
a
large
may
be
that
the
reason
why
i
left
the
case
with
peck
said
the
doctor
smiling
putney
did
leave
off
my
medicine
did
he
he
never
got
well
so
soon
before
they
both
say
that
i
did
think
you
could
be
so
morrell
but
of
course
your
scientific
bigotry
could
admit
the
effect
of
the
moral
influence
it
would
be
too
much
like
a
miracle
you
would
have
to
allow
for
a
i
have
to
allow
for
a
good
many
said
the
doctor
the
world
is
full
of
mysteries
for
me
if
you
mean
things
that
science
has
explored
yet
but
i
hope
that
they
all
yield
to
the
light
and
that
somewhere
there
be
light
enough
to
clear
up
even
the
spiritual
do
you
really
she
demanded
eagerly
then
you
believe
in
a
life
hereafter
you
believe
in
a
moral
government
of
the
he
retreated
laughing
from
her
ardent
pursuit
oh
i
not
going
to
commit
myself
but
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
i
like
to
hear
peck
preach
and
that
i
want
him
to
stay
i
do
say
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
putney
straightening
up
putney
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
himself
what
does
he
think
peck
chances
are
if
gerrish
tries
to
get
him
dismissed
he
does
know
he
quite
in
the
dark
he
says
the
party
of
the
perverse
the
people
who
think
gerrish
must
have
had
some
good
reason
for
his
behaviour
simply
because
they
ca
see
any
is
unexpectedly
large
and
it
does
help
matters
with
the
more
respectable
people
that
the
most
respectable
like
wilmington
and
colonel
marvin
are
peck
friends
they
think
there
must
be
something
wrong
if
such
good
men
are
opposed
to
and
i
suspect
said
morrell
soberly
that
putney
championship
is
altogether
an
advantage
the
people
all
concede
his
brilliancy
and
they
are
prouder
of
him
on
account
of
his
infirmity
but
i
guess
they
like
to
feel
their
superiority
to
him
in
practical
matters
they
admire
him
but
they
do
want
to
follow
oh
i
suppose
so
said
annie
disconsolately
and
i
imagine
that
wilmington
course
is
attributed
to
lyra
and
that
does
help
peck
much
with
the
husbands
of
the
ladies
who
do
approve
of
the
doctor
tacitly
declined
to
touch
this
delicate
point
he
asked
after
a
pause
you
be
at
the
meeting
i
could
keep
away
but
i
no
vote
that
the
worst
i
can
only
suffer
in
the
the
doctor
smiled
you
must
go
too
she
added
eagerly
oh
i
shall
go
i
could
keep
away
either
besides
i
can
vote
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
little
idella
well
it
is
such
a
simple
matter
as
i
supposed
quite
did
you
ever
hear
anything
about
her
mother
nothing
more
than
what
every
one
has
why
asked
the
doctor
with
scientific
curiosity
do
you
find
traits
that
the
father
does
account
for
yes
she
is
very
vain
and
greedy
and
are
those
traits
uncommon
in
children
in
such
a
degree
i
should
think
they
were
but
she
very
affectionate
too
and
you
can
do
anything
with
her
through
her
love
of
praise
she
puzzles
me
a
good
deal
i
wish
i
knew
something
about
her
mother
but
peck
himself
is
a
puzzle
with
all
my
respect
for
him
and
regard
and
admiration
i
ca
help
seeing
that
he
a
very
imperfect
doctor
morrell
laughed
there
a
great
deal
of
human
nature
in
there
is
enough
in
peck
annie
retorted
from
the
very
first
he
has
said
things
that
have
stirred
me
up
and
put
me
in
a
fever
but
he
always
seems
to
be
cold
and
passive
perhaps
he
cold
said
the
doctor
but
has
he
any
to
be
so
retorted
annie
with
certainly
no
coldness
of
her
own
well
i
do
know
i
never
thought
of
the
right
or
wrong
of
a
man
being
what
he
was
born
perhaps
we
might
justly
blame
his
annie
broke
into
a
laugh
at
herself
of
course
but
do
you
think
that
a
man
who
is
able
to
put
things
as
he
does
who
can
make
you
see
for
example
the
stupidity
and
cruelty
of
things
that
always
seemed
right
and
proper
before
do
you
think
that
he
guilty
of
a
kind
of
hypocrisy
if
he
does
as
well
as
see
no
i
ca
say
that
i
do
said
the
doctor
with
pleasure
in
the
feminine
excess
of
her
demand
and
there
are
so
many
ways
of
feeling
we
apt
to
think
that
our
own
way
is
the
only
way
of
course
but
i
suppose
that
most
philanthropists
men
who
have
done
the
most
to
better
conditions
have
been
people
of
cold
temperaments
and
yet
you
ca
say
they
are
no
certainly
do
you
think
peck
is
a
real
philanthropist
how
you
do
get
back
to
the
personal
always
said
morrell
what
makes
you
ask
because
i
ca
understand
his
indifference
to
his
child
it
seems
to
me
that
real
philanthropy
would
begin
at
home
but
twice
he
has
distinctly
forgotten
her
existence
and
he
always
seems
bored
with
it
or
not
that
quite
but
she
seems
no
more
to
him
than
any
other
there
something
very
curious
about
all
that
said
the
doctor
in
most
things
the
greater
includes
the
less
but
in
philanthropy
it
seems
to
exclude
it
if
a
man
heart
is
open
to
the
whole
world
to
all
men
shut
sometimes
against
the
individual
even
the
nearest
and
dearest
you
see
i
willing
to
admit
all
you
can
say
against
a
rival
oh
i
understand
said
annie
but
i
not
going
to
gratify
your
at
the
same
time
she
tacitly
consented
to
the
slight
for
peck
which
their
joking
about
him
involved
in
such
cases
we
excuse
our
disloyalty
as
merely
temporary
and
intend
to
turn
serious
again
and
make
full
amends
for
it
he
made
very
short
work
she
continued
of
that
notion
of
yours
that
there
could
be
any
good
feeling
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
who
had
once
been
poor
did
i
have
any
such
notion
as
that
she
recalled
the
time
and
place
of
its
expression
to
him
and
he
said
oh
yes
well
he
says
that
rich
people
like
that
are
apt
to
be
the
hardest
masters
and
are
eager
to
forget
they
ever
were
poor
and
are
only
anxious
to
identify
themselves
with
the
morrell
seemed
to
enjoy
this
immensely
that
does
rather
settle
it
he
said
recreantly
she
tried
to
be
severe
with
him
but
she
only
kept
on
laughing
and
joking
she
was
aware
that
he
was
luring
her
away
from
her
seriousness
bolton
brought
in
the
lamp
and
set
it
on
the
library
table
showing
her
gaunt
outline
a
moment
against
it
before
she
left
it
to
throw
its
softened
light
into
the
parlour
where
they
sat
the
autumn
moonshine
almost
as
mellow
fell
in
through
the
open
windows
which
let
in
the
shrilling
of
the
crickets
and
grasshoppers
and
wafts
of
the
warm
night
wind
does
life
annie
was
asking
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
seem
more
simple
or
more
complicated
as
you
live
on
that
sounds
awfully
abstruse
does
it
and
i
do
know
why
i
always
asking
you
abstruse
things
but
i
oh
i
do
mind
it
said
the
doctor
perhaps
i
have
lived
on
long
enough
to
answer
this
particular
question
i
only
you
i
and
i
feel
a
hundred
she
broke
in
you
do
look
it
but
i
believe
i
rather
like
abstruse
questions
you
know
putney
and
i
have
discussed
a
great
many
but
just
what
do
you
mean
by
this
particular
abstraction
he
took
from
the
table
a
large
ivory
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
playing
with
in
his
visits
and
laid
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
side
of
its
smooth
cool
blade
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
as
he
leaned
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
bent
his
smiling
eyes
keenly
upon
her
she
stopped
rocking
herself
and
said
imperatively
will
you
please
put
that
back
morrell
this
yes
and
not
look
at
me
just
in
that
way
when
you
get
that
knife
and
that
look
i
feel
a
little
too
much
as
if
you
were
diagnosing
diagnosticating
suggested
the
doctor
is
it
i
always
supposed
it
was
diagnosing
but
it
does
matter
it
was
the
name
i
was
objecting
he
put
the
knife
back
and
changed
his
posture
with
a
smile
that
left
nothing
of
professional
scrutiny
in
his
look
very
well
then
you
shall
diagnose
diagnosticate
oh
i
thought
you
preferred
the
no
it
sounds
undignified
now
that
i
know
there
a
larger
word
where
was
i
the
personal
bearing
of
the
question
whether
life
is
more
and
more
complicated
how
did
you
know
it
had
a
personal
bearing
i
suspected
as
yes
it
has
i
mean
that
within
the
last
four
or
five
months
since
been
in
hatboro
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
old
point
of
view
or
rather
i
do
find
it
satisfactory
any
more
i
ashamed
to
think
of
the
simple
plans
or
dreams
that
i
came
home
with
i
hardly
remember
what
they
were
but
i
must
have
expected
to
be
a
sort
of
lady
bountiful
here
and
now
i
think
a
lady
bountiful
one
of
the
most
mischievous
persons
that
could
infest
any
you
do
mean
that
charity
is
played
out
asked
the
doctor
in
the
way
but
they
say
poverty
is
on
the
increase
what
is
to
be
done
justice
said
annie
those
who
do
most
of
the
work
in
the
world
ought
to
share
in
its
comforts
as
a
right
and
not
be
put
off
with
what
we
idlers
have
a
mind
to
give
them
from
our
superfluity
as
a
yes
that
all
very
true
but
what
till
justice
done
oh
we
must
continue
to
do
charity
cried
annie
with
that
amused
him
but
do
you
see
how
much
more
complicated
it
is
that
what
i
meant
by
life
not
being
simple
any
more
it
was
easy
enough
to
do
charity
when
it
used
to
seem
the
right
and
proper
remedy
for
suffering
but
now
when
i
ca
make
it
appear
a
finality
but
only
something
provisional
temporary
do
you
see
yes
i
see
but
i
do
see
how
you
going
to
help
it
at
the
same
time
i
allow
that
it
makes
life
more
for
a
moment
they
were
both
serious
and
silent
then
she
said
sometimes
i
think
the
fault
is
all
in
myself
and
that
if
i
were
not
so
sophisticated
and
and
selfish
i
should
find
the
old
way
of
doing
good
just
as
effective
and
natural
as
ever
then
again
i
think
the
conditions
are
all
wrong
and
that
we
ought
to
be
fairer
to
people
and
then
we
need
be
so
good
to
them
i
should
prefer
that
i
hate
being
good
to
people
i
like
and
i
ca
like
people
who
do
interest
me
i
think
i
must
be
very
the
doctor
laughed
at
this
oh
i
know
said
annie
i
know
the
fraudulent
reputation
i
got
for
good
your
charity
to
tramps
is
the
opprobrium
of
hatboro
the
doctor
consented
oh
i
do
mind
that
it
easy
when
people
ask
you
for
food
or
money
but
the
horrible
thing
is
when
they
ask
you
for
work
think
of
me
who
never
did
anything
to
earn
a
cent
in
my
life
being
humbly
asked
by
a
to
let
him
work
for
something
to
eat
and
drink
hideous
it
abominable
at
first
i
used
to
be
flattered
by
it
and
try
to
conjure
up
something
for
them
to
do
and
to
believe
that
i
was
helping
the
deserving
poor
now
i
give
all
of
them
money
and
tell
them
that
they
need
even
pretend
to
work
for
it
do
work
for
my
money
and
i
do
see
why
they
they
find
that
an
unanswerable
argument
if
you
put
it
to
them
said
the
doctor
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
the
and
then
withdrew
it
in
a
way
that
made
her
laugh
but
the
worst
of
it
is
she
resumed
that
i
do
love
any
of
the
people
that
i
help
or
hurt
whichever
it
is
i
did
feel
remorseful
toward
savor
for
a
while
but
i
did
love
her
and
i
knew
that
i
only
pitied
myself
through
her
do
you
see
no
i
do
said
the
doctor
you
do
because
you
too
polite
the
only
kind
of
creature
that
i
can
have
any
sympathy
with
is
some
little
wretch
like
idella
who
is
perfectly
selfish
and
naughty
every
way
but
seems
to
want
me
to
like
her
and
a
reprobate
like
lyra
or
some
broken
creature
like
poor
ralph
i
think
there
something
in
the
air
the
atmosphere
that
wo
allow
you
to
live
in
the
old
way
if
you
got
a
grain
of
conscience
or
humanity
i
mean
that
have
but
it
seems
to
me
as
if
the
world
could
go
on
as
it
has
been
doing
even
here
in
america
where
i
used
to
think
we
had
the
millennium
because
slavery
was
abolished
people
have
more
liberty
but
they
seem
just
as
far
off
as
ever
from
justice
that
is
what
paralyses
me
and
mocks
me
and
laughs
in
my
face
when
i
remember
how
i
used
to
dream
of
doing
good
after
i
came
home
i
had
better
stayed
at
the
doctor
said
vaguely
i
glad
you
did
and
he
let
his
eyes
dwell
on
her
with
a
return
of
the
professional
interest
which
she
was
too
lost
in
her
self
reproach
to
be
able
to
resent
i
blame
myself
for
trying
to
excuse
my
own
failure
on
the
plea
that
things
generally
have
gone
wrong
at
times
it
seems
to
me
that
i
responsible
for
having
lost
my
faith
in
what
i
used
to
think
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
then
again
it
seems
as
if
the
world
were
all
so
bad
that
no
real
good
could
be
done
in
the
old
way
and
that
my
faith
is
gone
because
there
nothing
for
it
to
rest
on
any
longer
i
feel
that
something
must
be
done
but
i
do
know
it
would
be
hard
to
say
said
the
doctor
she
perceived
that
her
exaltation
amused
him
but
she
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
care
then
we
are
guilty
all
guilty
till
we
find
out
and
begin
to
do
it
if
the
world
has
come
to
such
a
pass
that
you
ca
do
anything
but
harm
in
it
oh
is
it
so
bad
as
that
he
protested
it
as
bad
she
insisted
just
see
what
mischief
i
done
since
i
came
back
to
hatboro
i
took
hold
of
that
miserable
social
union
because
i
was
outside
of
all
the
life
about
me
and
it
seemed
my
only
chance
of
getting
into
it
and
i
done
more
harm
by
it
in
one
summer
than
i
could
undo
in
a
lifetime
just
think
of
poor
brandreth
love
affair
with
miss
chapley
broken
off
and
lyra
lamentable
triumph
over
miss
northwick
and
munger
duplicity
and
ralph
escapade
all
because
i
wanted
to
do
good
a
note
of
exaggeration
had
begun
to
prevail
in
her
which
was
real
enough
and
the
time
came
for
him
to
suggest
i
think
you
a
little
morbid
miss
morbid
of
course
i
am
but
that
does
alter
the
fact
that
everything
is
wrong
does
it
everything
why
you
do
pretend
yourself
do
you
that
everything
is
right
a
true
american
ought
to
do
so
ought
he
teased
the
doctor
one
must
be
a
bad
but
if
you
a
bad
citizen
she
persisted
oh
then
i
might
agree
with
you
on
some
points
but
i
should
say
such
things
to
my
patients
miss
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
them
if
you
did
she
sighed
the
doctor
broke
out
in
a
laugh
of
delight
at
her
perfervid
concentration
oh
no
no
they
mostly
nervous
women
and
it
would
be
the
death
of
them
if
they
understood
me
in
fact
what
the
use
of
brooding
upon
such
ideas
we
ca
hurry
any
change
but
we
can
make
ourselves
why
should
i
be
comfortable
she
asked
with
a
solemnity
that
made
him
laugh
again
why
should
you
be
yes
that
what
i
often
ask
myself
but
i
ca
be
she
said
sadly
they
had
risen
and
he
looked
at
her
with
his
professional
interest
now
openly
dominant
as
he
stood
holding
her
hand
i
going
to
send
you
a
little
more
of
that
tonic
miss
she
pulled
her
hand
away
no
i
shall
not
take
any
more
medicine
you
think
everything
is
physical
why
do
you
ask
at
once
to
see
my
tongue
he
went
out
laughing
and
she
stood
looking
wistfully
at
the
door
he
had
passed
through
xxv
the
bell
on
the
orthodox
church
called
the
members
of
peck
society
together
for
the
business
meeting
with
the
same
plangent
lacerant
note
that
summoned
them
to
worship
on
sundays
among
those
who
crowded
the
house
were
many
who
had
not
been
there
before
and
seldom
in
any
place
of
the
kind
there
were
admirers
of
putney
workmen
of
rebellious
repute
and
of
advanced
opinions
on
social
and
religious
questions
nonsuited
plaintiffs
and
defendants
of
shady
record
for
whom
he
had
at
one
time
or
another
done
what
he
could
a
good
number
of
the
summer
folk
from
south
hatboro
were
present
with
the
expectation
of
something
dramatic
which
every
one
felt
and
every
one
hid
with
the
discipline
that
subdues
the
outside
of
life
in
a
new
england
town
to
a
decorous
passivity
at
the
appointed
time
peck
rose
to
open
the
meeting
with
prayer
then
as
if
nothing
unusual
were
likely
to
come
before
it
he
declared
it
ready
to
proceed
to
business
some
people
who
had
been
gathering
in
the
vestibule
during
his
prayer
came
in
and
the
electric
globes
which
had
been
recently
hung
above
the
pulpit
and
on
the
front
of
the
gallery
in
substitution
of
the
old
gas
chandelier
shed
their
moony
glare
upon
a
house
in
which
few
places
were
vacant
gerrish
sitting
erect
and
solemn
beside
his
wife
in
their
pew
shared
with
the
minister
and
putney
the
tacit
interest
of
the
audience
he
permitted
the
transaction
of
several
minor
affairs
and
peck
as
moderator
conducted
the
business
with
his
habitual
exactness
and
effect
of
impersonality
the
people
waited
with
exemplary
patience
and
putney
who
lounged
in
one
corner
of
his
pew
gave
no
more
sign
of
excitement
with
his
chin
sunk
in
his
rumpled
than
his
wife
at
the
other
end
of
the
seat
gerrish
rose
with
the
air
of
rising
in
his
own
good
time
and
said
with
dry
pomp
mr
moderator
i
have
prepared
a
resolution
which
i
will
ask
you
to
read
to
this
he
held
up
a
paper
as
he
spoke
and
then
passed
it
to
the
minister
who
opened
and
read
it
it
is
indispensable
to
the
prosperity
and
of
any
and
every
organisation
and
especially
of
a
christian
church
that
the
teachings
of
its
minister
be
in
accord
with
the
convictions
of
a
majority
of
its
members
upon
vital
questions
of
eternal
interest
with
the
end
and
aim
of
securing
the
greatest
efficiency
of
that
body
in
the
community
as
an
example
and
a
shining
light
before
men
to
guide
their
steps
in
the
strait
and
narrow
path
therefore
that
a
committee
of
this
society
be
appointed
to
inquire
if
such
is
the
case
in
the
instance
of
the
rev
julius
peck
and
be
instructed
to
report
upon
the
a
satisfied
expectation
expressed
itself
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
reading
of
the
paper
whatever
pain
and
shame
were
mixed
with
the
satisfaction
if
the
contempt
of
kindly
usage
shown
in
offering
such
a
resolution
without
warning
or
private
notice
to
the
minister
shocked
many
by
its
brutality
still
it
was
satisfactory
to
find
that
gerrish
had
intended
to
seize
the
first
chance
of
airing
his
grievance
as
everybody
had
said
he
would
do
peck
looked
up
from
the
paper
and
across
the
intervening
pews
at
gerrish
do
i
understand
that
you
move
the
adoption
of
this
resolution
why
certainly
sir
said
gerrish
with
an
accent
of
supercilious
surprise
you
did
not
say
so
said
the
minister
gently
does
any
one
second
brother
gerrish
motion
a
murmur
of
amusement
followed
peck
reminder
to
gerrish
and
an
ironical
voice
called
out
mr
moderator
mr
i
think
it
important
that
the
sense
of
the
meeting
should
be
taken
on
the
question
the
resolution
raises
i
therefore
second
the
motion
for
its
putney
sat
down
and
the
murmur
now
broadened
into
something
like
a
general
laugh
hushed
as
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
impropriety
gerrish
had
gradually
sunk
into
his
seat
but
now
he
rose
again
and
when
the
minister
formally
announced
the
motion
before
the
meeting
he
called
sharply
mr
moderator
brother
gerrish
responded
the
minister
in
recognition
i
wish
to
offer
a
few
remarks
in
support
of
the
resolution
which
i
have
had
the
honour
the
duty
i
say
of
laying
before
this
he
jerked
his
head
forward
at
the
last
word
and
slid
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
like
an
orator
and
stood
very
straight
i
have
no
desire
sir
to
make
this
the
occasion
of
a
personal
question
between
myself
and
my
pastor
but
sir
the
question
has
been
forced
upon
me
against
my
will
and
my
my
consent
and
i
was
obliged
on
the
last
ensuing
sabbath
when
i
sat
in
this
place
to
enter
my
public
protest
against
it
sir
i
came
into
this
community
a
poor
boy
without
a
penny
in
my
pocket
and
unaided
and
alone
and
by
my
own
exertions
i
have
built
up
one
of
the
business
interests
of
the
place
i
will
not
stoop
to
boast
of
the
part
i
have
taken
in
the
prosperity
of
this
place
but
i
will
say
that
no
public
object
has
been
wanting
that
my
support
has
not
been
wanting
from
the
first
proposition
to
concrete
the
sidewalks
of
this
village
to
the
introduction
of
city
waterworks
and
an
improved
system
of
drainage
and
er
electric
lighting
so
much
for
my
standing
in
a
public
capacity
as
for
my
business
capacity
i
would
gladly
let
that
speak
for
itself
if
that
capacity
had
not
been
turned
in
the
sanctuary
itself
against
the
personal
reputation
which
every
man
holds
dearer
than
life
itself
and
which
has
had
a
deadly
blow
aimed
at
it
through
that
that
very
capacity
sir
i
have
established
in
this
town
a
business
which
i
may
humbly
say
that
in
no
other
place
of
the
same
numerical
size
throughout
the
commonwealth
will
you
find
another
establishment
so
nearly
corresponding
to
the
wants
and
the
er
facilities
of
a
great
city
in
no
other
establishment
in
a
place
of
the
same
importance
will
you
find
the
interests
and
the
demands
and
the
necessities
of
the
whole
community
so
carefully
considered
in
no
other
putney
got
upon
his
feet
and
called
out
mr
moderator
will
brother
gerrish
allow
me
to
ask
him
a
single
question
peck
put
the
request
and
gerrish
involuntarily
made
a
pause
in
which
putney
pursued
my
question
is
simply
this
does
brother
gerrish
think
it
would
help
us
to
get
at
the
business
in
hand
sooner
if
he
would
print
the
rest
of
his
advertisement
in
the
hatboro
a
laugh
broke
out
all
over
the
house
as
putney
dropped
back
into
his
seat
gerrish
stood
apparently
undaunted
i
will
attend
to
you
presently
sir
he
said
with
a
schoolmasterly
authority
which
made
an
impression
in
his
favour
with
some
and
i
thank
the
gentleman
he
continued
turning
again
to
address
the
minister
for
recalling
me
from
a
side
issue
as
he
acknowledges
in
the
suggestion
which
he
intended
to
wound
my
feelings
but
i
can
assure
him
that
my
is
beyond
the
reach
of
slurs
and
innuendoes
i
care
little
for
them
i
care
not
what
quarter
they
originate
from
or
have
their
their
origin
and
still
less
when
they
spring
from
a
source
notoriously
incompetent
and
unworthy
to
command
the
respect
of
this
community
which
has
abused
all
its
privileges
and
trampled
the
forbearance
of
its
under
foot
until
it
has
become
a
a
byword
in
this
place
putney
sprang
up
again
with
mr
moderator
no
sir
no
sir
pursued
gerrish
i
will
not
submit
to
your
interruptions
i
have
the
floor
and
i
intend
to
keep
it
i
intend
to
challenge
a
full
and
fearless
scrutiny
of
my
motives
in
this
matter
and
i
intend
to
probe
those
motives
in
others
why
do
we
find
sir
on
the
one
side
of
this
question
as
its
most
active
exponent
a
man
outside
of
the
church
in
organising
a
force
within
this
society
to
antagonise
the
most
cherished
convictions
of
that
church
we
do
not
asperse
his
motives
but
we
ask
if
these
motives
coincide
with
the
relations
which
a
christian
minister
should
sustain
to
his
flock
as
expressed
in
the
resolution
which
i
have
had
the
privilege
to
offer
more
in
sorrow
than
in
putney
made
some
starts
to
rise
but
quelled
himself
and
finally
sank
back
with
an
air
of
ironical
patience
gerrish
personalities
had
turned
public
sentiment
in
his
favour
colonel
marvin
came
over
to
putney
pew
and
shook
hands
with
him
before
sitting
down
by
his
side
he
began
to
talk
with
him
in
whisper
while
gerrish
went
on
but
on
the
other
hand
sir
what
do
we
see
i
will
not
allude
to
myself
in
this
connection
but
i
am
well
aware
sir
that
i
represent
a
large
and
growing
majority
of
this
church
in
the
stand
i
have
taken
we
are
tired
sir
and
i
say
it
to
you
openly
sir
what
has
been
bruited
about
in
secret
long
enough
of
having
what
i
may
call
a
gospel
preached
in
this
church
and
from
this
pulpit
we
enter
our
protest
against
the
neglect
of
very
essential
elements
of
christianity
not
to
say
the
essential
the
representation
of
christ
as
a
a
spirit
as
well
as
a
life
understand
me
sir
we
do
not
object
neither
i
nor
any
of
those
who
agree
with
me
to
the
preaching
of
christ
as
a
life
that
is
all
very
well
in
its
place
and
it
is
the
wish
of
every
true
christian
to
conform
and
adapt
his
own
life
as
far
as
as
circumstances
will
permit
of
but
when
i
come
to
this
sanctuary
and
come
sabbath
after
sabbath
and
hear
nothing
said
of
my
redeemer
as
a
means
of
salvation
and
nothing
of
him
crucified
and
when
i
find
the
precious
promises
of
the
gospel
ignored
and
neglected
continually
and
and
all
the
time
and
each
discourse
from
yonder
pulpit
filled
up
with
generalities
glittering
generalities
as
has
been
well
said
by
another
in
relation
to
and
connection
with
mere
conduct
i
am
disappointed
sir
and
dissatisfied
and
i
feel
to
protest
against
that
line
of
of
preaching
during
the
last
six
months
sabbath
after
sabbath
i
have
listened
in
vain
for
the
ministrations
of
the
plain
gospel
and
the
tenets
under
which
we
have
been
blessed
as
a
church
and
as
a
people
instead
of
this
i
have
heard
as
i
have
said
and
i
repeat
it
without
fear
of
contradiction
nothing
but
appeals
and
mere
moralisings
upon
duty
to
others
which
a
child
and
the
veriest
tyro
could
not
fail
therein
and
i
have
culminated
or
rather
it
has
been
culminated
to
me
in
a
covert
attack
upon
my
private
affairs
and
my
way
of
conducting
my
private
business
in
a
manner
which
i
could
not
overlook
for
that
reason
and
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
recapitulated
and
i
challenge
the
closest
scrutiny
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
enter
my
public
protest
and
to
leave
this
sanctuary
where
i
have
worshipped
ever
since
it
was
erected
with
my
family
and
i
now
urge
the
adoption
of
the
foregoing
resolution
because
i
believe
that
your
usefulness
has
come
to
an
end
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
constituent
members
of
this
church
and
and
that
is
gerrish
stopped
so
abruptly
that
putney
who
was
engaged
in
talk
with
colonel
marvin
looked
up
with
a
startled
air
too
late
to
secure
the
floor
peck
recognised
gates
who
stood
with
his
wrists
caught
in
either
hand
across
his
middle
and
looked
round
with
a
quizzical
glance
before
he
began
to
speak
putney
lifted
his
hand
in
playful
threatening
toward
colonel
marvin
who
got
away
from
him
with
a
face
of
noiseless
laughter
and
went
and
joined
wilmington
where
he
sat
with
his
wife
who
entered
into
the
talk
between
the
men
mr
moderator
said
gates
i
do
know
as
i
expected
to
take
part
in
this
debate
but
you
ca
always
tell
what
going
to
happen
to
you
even
if
you
only
a
member
of
the
church
by
marriage
as
you
might
say
i
presume
though
that
i
have
a
right
to
speak
in
a
meeting
like
this
because
i
a
member
of
the
society
in
my
own
right
and
i
got
its
interests
at
heart
as
much
as
any
one
i
do
know
but
what
i
got
the
interests
of
hatboro
at
heart
too
but
i
ca
be
certain
sometimes
you
ca
sometimes
you
think
you
got
the
common
good
in
view
and
you
come
to
look
a
little
closer
and
you
find
it
the
uncommon
good
that
is
to
say
it
not
so
much
the
public
weal
you
after
as
what
it
is
the
private
weal
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
i
have
got
anything
to
say
against
identifying
yourself
with
things
in
general
i
do
know
but
what
it
a
good
way
all
is
it
apt
to
make
you
think
you
personally
attacked
when
nobody
is
meant
in
particular
think
that
partly
the
matter
with
brother
gerrish
here
i
heard
that
sermon
and
i
did
suppose
there
was
anything
in
it
to
hurt
any
one
especially
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
gerrish
seemed
to
take
it
to
himself
somehow
and
worry
over
it
but
i
did
really
know
just
what
the
trouble
was
till
he
explained
here
tonight
all
i
was
thinking
was
when
it
come
to
that
about
large
commerce
devouring
the
small
sort
of
lean
and
fat
kine
i
wished
jordan
and
marsh
could
hear
that
or
stewart
in
new
york
or
wanamaker
in
philadelphia
i
never
of
brother
gerrish
once
and
i
do
presume
one
out
of
a
hundred
did
either
i
the
electric
light
immediately
over
gates
head
began
to
hiss
and
sputter
and
to
suffer
the
sort
of
syncope
which
overtakes
electric
lights
at
such
times
and
to
leave
the
house
in
darkness
gates
waited
standing
till
it
revived
and
then
added
i
guess
i
hai
got
anything
more
to
say
moderator
if
i
had
it
gone
from
me
now
i
more
used
to
speaking
by
kerosene
and
i
always
lose
my
breath
when
an
electric
light
begins
that
putney
was
on
his
legs
in
good
time
now
and
secured
recognition
before
wilmington
who
made
an
effort
to
catch
the
moderator
eye
gates
had
put
the
meeting
in
expectation
of
what
they
might
now
have
from
putney
they
liked
gates
points
very
well
but
they
hoped
from
putney
something
more
cruel
and
unsparing
and
the
greater
part
of
those
present
must
have
shared
his
impatience
with
wilmington
request
that
he
would
give
way
to
him
for
a
moment
yet
they
all
probably
felt
the
same
curiosity
about
what
was
going
forward
for
it
was
plain
that
wilmington
and
colonel
marvin
were
conniving
at
the
same
point
marvin
had
now
gone
to
gerrish
and
had
slipped
into
the
pew
beside
him
with
the
same
sort
of
he
had
given
putney
will
my
friend
putney
give
way
to
me
for
a
moment
asked
wilmington
i
do
see
why
i
should
do
that
said
putney
i
assure
him
that
i
will
not
abuse
his
courtesy
and
that
i
will
yield
the
floor
to
him
at
any
putney
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
with
the
contented
laugh
of
one
who
securely
bides
his
time
said
go
it
is
simply
this
said
wilmington
with
a
certain
formal
neatness
of
speech
the
point
has
been
touched
by
the
last
speaker
which
i
think
suggested
itself
to
all
who
heard
the
remarks
of
brother
gerrish
in
support
of
his
resolution
and
the
point
is
simply
this
whether
he
has
not
misapplied
the
words
of
the
discourse
by
which
he
felt
himself
aggrieved
and
whether
he
has
not
given
them
a
particular
bearing
foreign
to
the
intention
of
their
author
if
as
i
believe
this
is
the
case
the
whole
matter
can
be
easily
settled
by
a
private
conference
between
the
parties
and
we
can
be
saved
the
public
appearance
of
disagreement
in
our
society
and
i
would
now
ask
brother
gerrish
in
behalf
of
many
who
take
this
view
with
me
whether
he
will
not
consent
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
whether
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
end
proposed
he
will
not
for
the
present
at
least
withdraw
the
resolution
he
has
offered
wilmington
sat
down
amidst
a
general
sensation
which
was
heightened
by
putney
failure
to
anticipate
any
action
on
gerrish
part
gerrish
rapidly
finished
something
he
was
saying
to
colonel
marvin
and
then
half
rose
and
said
mr
moderator
i
withdraw
my
resolution
for
the
time
being
and
for
the
present
sir
and
sat
down
again
mr
moderator
putney
called
sharply
from
his
place
this
is
altogether
unparliamentary
that
resolution
is
properly
before
the
meeting
its
adoption
has
been
moved
and
seconded
and
it
can
not
be
withdrawn
without
leave
granted
by
a
vote
of
the
meeting
i
wish
to
discuss
the
resolution
in
all
its
bearings
and
i
think
there
are
a
great
many
present
who
share
with
me
a
desire
to
know
how
far
it
represents
the
sense
of
this
society
i
do
mean
as
to
the
supposed
personal
reflections
which
it
was
intended
to
punish
that
is
a
very
small
matter
and
as
compared
with
the
other
questions
involved
of
no
consequence
putney
tossed
his
head
with
insolent
pleasure
in
his
contempt
of
gerrish
his
nostrils
swelled
and
he
closed
his
little
jaws
with
a
firmness
that
made
his
heavy
black
moustache
hang
down
below
the
corners
of
his
chin
he
went
on
with
a
wicked
twinkle
in
his
eye
and
a
look
all
round
to
see
that
people
were
waiting
to
take
his
next
point
i
judge
my
old
friend
brother
gerrish
by
myself
my
old
friend
gerrish
cares
no
more
really
about
personal
allusions
than
i
do
what
he
really
had
at
heart
in
offering
his
resolution
was
not
any
supposed
attack
upon
himself
or
his
shop
from
the
pulpit
of
this
church
he
cared
no
more
for
that
than
i
should
care
for
a
reference
to
my
notorious
habits
these
are
things
that
we
feel
may
be
safely
left
to
the
judgment
the
charitable
judgment
of
the
community
which
will
be
equally
merciful
to
the
man
who
devours
widows
houses
and
to
the
man
who
an
enemy
in
his
mouth
to
steal
away
his
brains
mr
moderator
said
colonel
marvin
getting
upon
his
feet
no
sir
shouted
putney
fiercely
i
ca
allow
you
to
speak
wait
till
i
get
done
he
stopped
and
then
said
gently
excuse
me
colonel
i
really
must
go
on
i
speaking
now
in
behalf
of
brother
gerrish
and
he
like
to
have
the
speaking
on
his
side
oh
all
right
said
colonel
marvin
amiably
go
what
my
old
friend
william
gerrish
really
designed
in
offering
that
resolution
was
to
bring
into
question
the
kind
of
christianity
which
has
been
preached
in
this
place
by
our
pastor
the
gospel
as
he
aptly
called
it
and
what
he
and
i
want
to
get
at
is
the
opinion
of
the
society
on
that
question
has
the
gospel
preached
to
us
here
been
or
has
it
brother
gerrish
says
it
has
and
brother
gerrish
as
i
understand
does
change
his
mind
on
that
point
if
he
does
on
any
in
asking
to
withdraw
his
resolution
he
does
expect
peck
to
convince
him
in
a
private
conference
that
he
has
been
preaching
an
gospel
i
do
contend
that
he
has
but
i
suppose
i
not
a
very
competent
judge
i
do
propose
to
give
you
the
opinion
of
one
very
fallible
and
erring
man
and
i
do
set
myself
up
in
judgment
of
others
but
i
think
important
for
all
parties
concerned
to
know
what
the
majority
of
this
society
think
on
a
question
involving
its
future
that
importance
must
excuse
if
anything
can
excuse
the
apparent
want
of
taste
of
humanity
of
decency
in
proposing
the
inquiry
at
a
meeting
over
which
the
person
chiefly
concerned
would
naturally
preside
unless
he
were
warned
to
absent
himself
nobody
cares
for
the
contemptible
point
the
wholly
insignificant
question
whether
allusion
to
gerrish
variety
store
was
intended
or
not
what
we
are
all
anxious
to
know
is
whether
he
represents
any
considerable
portion
of
this
society
in
his
general
attack
upon
its
pastor
i
want
a
vote
on
that
and
i
move
the
previous
no
one
stopped
to
inquire
whether
this
was
parliamentary
or
not
putney
sat
down
and
colonel
marvin
rose
to
say
that
if
a
vote
was
to
be
taken
it
was
only
right
and
just
that
peck
should
somehow
be
heard
in
his
own
behalf
and
half
a
dozen
voices
from
all
parts
of
the
church
supported
him
peck
after
a
moment
said
i
think
i
have
nothing
to
say
and
he
added
shall
i
put
the
question
question
question
came
from
different
quarters
it
is
moved
and
seconded
that
the
resolution
before
the
meeting
be
adopted
said
the
minister
formally
all
those
in
favour
will
say
he
waited
for
a
distinct
space
but
there
was
no
response
gerrish
himself
did
not
vote
the
minister
proceeded
those
opposed
will
say
the
word
burst
forth
everywhere
and
it
was
followed
by
laughter
and
inarticulate
expressions
of
triumph
and
mocking
order
order
called
the
minister
gravely
and
he
announced
the
noes
have
the
electric
light
began
to
suffer
another
syncope
when
it
recovered
with
the
usual
fizzing
and
sputtering
peck
was
on
his
feet
asking
to
be
relieved
from
his
duties
as
moderator
so
that
he
might
make
a
statement
to
the
meeting
colonel
marvin
was
voted
into
the
chair
but
refused
formally
to
take
possession
of
it
he
stood
up
and
said
there
is
no
place
where
we
would
rather
hear
you
than
in
that
pulpit
i
thank
you
said
the
minister
making
himself
heard
through
the
approving
murmur
but
i
stand
in
this
place
only
to
ask
to
be
allowed
to
leave
it
the
friendly
feeling
which
has
been
expressed
toward
me
in
the
vote
upon
the
resolution
you
have
just
rejected
is
all
that
reconciles
me
to
its
defeat
its
adoption
might
have
spared
me
a
duty
which
i
find
painful
but
perhaps
it
is
best
that
i
should
discharge
it
as
to
the
sermon
which
called
forth
that
resolution
it
is
only
just
to
say
that
i
intended
no
personalities
in
it
and
i
humbly
entreat
any
one
who
felt
himself
aggrieved
to
believe
every
one
looked
at
gerrish
to
see
how
he
took
this
he
must
have
felt
it
the
part
of
not
to
change
countenance
my
desire
in
that
discourse
was
as
always
to
present
the
truth
as
i
had
seen
it
and
try
to
make
it
a
help
to
all
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
the
author
of
the
resolution
was
wrong
in
arraigning
me
before
you
for
neglecting
a
very
vital
part
of
christianity
in
my
ministrations
here
i
think
with
him
that
those
who
have
made
an
open
profession
of
christ
have
a
claim
to
the
consolation
of
his
promises
and
to
the
support
which
good
men
have
found
in
the
mysteries
of
faith
and
i
ask
his
patience
and
that
of
others
who
feel
that
i
have
not
laid
sufficient
stress
upon
these
my
shortcoming
is
something
that
i
would
not
have
you
overlook
in
any
survey
of
my
ministry
among
you
and
i
am
not
here
now
to
defend
that
ministry
in
any
point
of
view
as
i
look
back
over
it
by
the
light
of
the
one
ineffable
ideal
it
seems
only
a
record
of
failure
and
he
stopped
and
a
sympathetic
dissent
ran
through
the
meeting
there
have
been
times
when
i
was
ready
to
think
that
the
fault
was
not
in
me
but
in
my
office
in
the
church
in
religion
we
all
have
these
moments
of
clouded
vision
in
which
we
ourselves
loom
up
in
illusory
grandeur
above
the
work
we
have
failed
to
do
but
it
is
in
no
such
error
that
i
stand
before
you
now
day
after
day
it
has
been
borne
in
upon
me
that
i
had
mistaken
my
work
here
and
that
i
ought
if
there
was
any
truth
in
me
to
turn
from
it
for
reasons
which
i
will
give
at
length
should
i
be
spared
to
preach
in
this
place
next
sabbath
i
should
have
willingly
acquiesced
if
our
parting
had
come
in
the
form
of
my
dismissal
at
your
hands
yet
i
can
not
wholly
regret
that
it
has
not
taken
that
form
and
that
in
offering
my
resignation
as
i
shall
formally
do
to
those
empowered
by
the
rules
of
our
society
to
receive
it
i
can
make
it
a
means
of
restoring
concord
among
you
it
would
be
affectation
in
me
to
pretend
that
i
did
not
know
of
the
dissension
which
has
had
my
ministry
for
its
object
if
not
its
cause
and
i
earnestly
hope
that
with
my
withdrawal
that
dissension
may
cease
and
that
this
church
may
become
a
symbol
before
the
world
of
the
peace
of
christ
i
conjure
such
of
my
friends
as
have
been
active
in
my
behalf
to
unite
with
their
brethren
in
a
cause
which
can
alone
merit
their
devotion
above
all
things
i
beseech
you
to
be
at
peace
one
with
another
forbear
forgive
submit
remembering
that
strife
for
the
better
part
can
only
make
it
the
worse
and
that
for
christians
there
can
be
no
rivalry
but
in
concession
and
colonel
marvin
forgot
his
office
and
all
parliamentary
proprieties
in
the
tide
of
emotion
that
swept
over
the
meeting
when
the
minister
sat
down
i
am
glad
he
said
that
no
sort
of
action
need
be
taken
now
upon
peck
proposed
resignation
which
i
for
one
can
not
believe
this
society
will
ever
agree
to
others
echoed
his
sentiment
they
spoke
out
sitting
and
standing
and
addressed
themselves
to
no
one
till
putney
moved
an
adjournment
which
colonel
marvin
sufficiently
recollected
himself
to
put
to
a
vote
and
declare
carried
annie
walked
home
with
the
putneys
and
morrell
she
was
aware
of
something
unwholesome
in
the
excitement
which
ran
so
wholly
in
favour
but
abandoned
herself
to
it
with
feverish
helplessness
cried
putney
when
they
were
free
of
the
crowd
which
pressed
upon
him
with
questions
and
conjectures
and
comments
what
a
slump
what
a
slump
that
blessed
little
seraph
has
spoilt
the
best
sport
that
ever
was
why
he
sent
that
fool
of
a
gerrish
home
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
right
in
the
part
of
his
attack
that
was
the
most
vilely
hypocritical
and
he
given
that
heartless
scoundrel
the
pleasure
of
feeling
like
an
honest
man
i
should
like
to
rap
peck
head
up
against
the
back
of
his
pulpit
and
i
should
like
to
knock
the
skulls
of
colonel
marvin
and
wilmington
together
and
see
which
was
the
thickest
why
i
had
gerrish
fairly
by
the
throat
at
last
and
i
was
just
reaching
for
the
balm
of
gilead
with
my
other
hand
to
give
him
a
dose
that
would
have
done
him
for
one
while
ah
it
too
bad
too
bad
well
well
but
haw
haw
haw
did
gerrish
tangle
himself
up
beautifully
in
his
rhetoric
i
guess
we
shall
fix
brother
gerrish
yet
and
i
do
think
we
shall
let
brother
peck
off
without
a
tussle
i
going
to
try
print
on
brother
gerrish
i
going
to
ask
him
in
the
hatboro
he
does
advertise
and
the
editor
as
independent
as
a
lion
where
a
man
do
advertise
indeed
he
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
annie
said
putney
i
shall
not
let
him
i
shall
make
him
drop
the
whole
affair
now
and
let
it
die
out
and
let
us
be
at
peace
again
as
peck
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
that
part
of
it
said
morrell
i
do
know
but
he
was
right
to
propose
himself
as
a
perhaps
there
no
other
way
well
said
putney
whether
he
goes
or
stays
i
think
we
owe
him
that
much
do
you
annie
oh
yes
sighed
annie
from
the
exaltation
to
which
the
events
of
the
evening
had
borne
her
and
we
must
let
him
go
it
would
be
a
loss
that
every
one
would
feel
that
i
tired
of
this
fighting
putney
broke
in
and
i
think
ruining
ralph
every
way
he
has
slept
the
last
two
nights
and
been
all
in
a
quiver
for
the
last
fortnight
for
my
part
i
do
care
what
happens
now
i
not
going
to
have
ralph
mixed
up
in
it
any
more
i
think
we
ought
all
to
forgive
and
forget
i
willing
to
overlook
everything
and
i
believe
others
are
the
you
better
ask
gerrish
the
next
time
she
calls
putney
interposed
putney
stopped
and
took
her
hand
from
her
husband
arm
well
after
what
gerrish
said
about
you
i
think
emmeline
had
better
call
soon
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
shrieked
putney
and
his
laugh
flapped
back
at
them
in
derisive
echo
from
the
they
were
passing
i
guess
brother
peck
had
better
stay
and
help
fight
it
out
it
wo
be
brotherly
love
after
he
goes
or
sisterly
xxvi
annie
knew
from
the
light
in
the
kitchen
window
that
bolton
who
had
not
gone
to
the
meeting
was
there
and
she
inferred
from
the
silence
of
the
house
that
bolton
had
not
yet
come
home
she
went
up
to
her
room
and
after
a
glance
at
idella
asleep
in
her
crib
she
began
to
lay
off
her
things
then
she
sat
down
provisionally
by
the
open
window
and
looked
out
into
the
still
autumnal
night
the
air
was
soft
and
humid
with
a
scent
of
smoke
in
it
from
remote
forest
fires
the
village
lights
showed
themselves
dimmed
by
the
haze
that
thickened
the
moonless
dark
she
heard
steps
on
the
gravel
of
the
lane
and
then
two
men
talking
one
of
whom
she
knew
to
be
bolton
in
a
little
while
the
back
entry
door
was
opened
and
shut
and
after
a
brief
murmur
of
voices
in
the
library
bolton
knocked
on
the
of
the
room
where
annie
sat
what
is
it
bolton
you
in
bed
yet
no
i
here
by
the
window
what
is
it
well
i
do
know
but
what
you
think
it
pretty
late
for
callers
but
peck
is
down
in
the
library
i
guess
he
wants
to
speak
with
you
about
idella
i
told
him
he
better
see
i
will
come
right
she
followed
bolton
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
where
she
kept
on
to
the
kitchen
while
annie
turned
into
the
library
peck
stood
beside
her
father
desk
resting
one
hand
on
it
and
holding
his
hat
in
the
other
wo
you
be
seated
peck
i
thank
you
it
only
for
a
moment
i
am
going
away
and
i
wish
to
speak
with
you
about
yes
certainly
but
surely
you
are
not
going
to
leave
hatboro
peck
i
hoped
we
all
did
that
after
what
you
had
seen
of
the
strong
feeling
in
your
favour
you
would
reconsider
your
determination
and
stay
with
us
she
went
on
impetuously
you
must
know
you
must
understand
now
how
much
good
you
can
do
here
more
than
any
one
else
more
than
you
could
do
anywhere
else
i
do
believe
that
you
realise
how
much
depends
upon
your
staying
here
you
ca
stop
the
dissensions
by
going
away
it
will
only
make
them
worse
you
saw
how
colonel
marvin
and
wilmington
were
with
you
and
gates
all
classes
i
ought
to
speak
to
attempt
to
teach
you
your
duty
i
not
of
your
church
and
i
can
only
tell
you
how
it
seems
to
me
that
you
never
can
find
another
place
where
your
principles
your
views
he
waited
for
her
to
go
on
but
she
really
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
he
began
i
am
not
hoping
for
another
charge
elsewhere
at
least
not
for
the
present
but
i
am
satisfied
that
my
usefulness
here
is
at
an
end
and
i
do
not
think
that
my
going
away
will
make
matters
worse
whether
i
go
or
stay
the
dissensions
will
continue
at
any
rate
i
believe
that
there
are
those
who
need
help
more
and
whom
i
can
help
more
in
another
field
yes
she
broke
in
with
a
woman
relevancy
to
the
immediate
point
there
is
nothing
to
do
he
went
on
as
if
she
had
not
spoken
i
am
going
to
fall
river
where
i
have
heard
that
there
is
work
for
me
in
the
mills
she
exclaimed
recurring
in
thought
to
what
he
had
once
said
of
his
work
in
them
surely
you
do
mean
that
the
sight
the
smell
the
tumult
of
the
work
she
had
seen
that
day
in
the
mill
with
lyra
came
upon
her
with
all
their
offence
to
throw
away
all
that
you
have
learnt
all
that
you
have
become
to
others
i
am
less
and
less
confident
that
i
have
become
anything
useful
to
others
in
turning
aside
from
the
life
of
toil
and
presuming
to
attempt
the
guidance
of
those
who
remained
in
it
but
i
do
mean
work
in
the
mills
he
continued
or
not
at
first
or
not
unless
it
seems
necessary
to
my
work
with
those
who
work
in
them
i
have
a
plan
or
if
it
hardly
deserves
that
name
a
design
of
being
useful
to
them
in
such
ways
as
my
own
experience
of
their
life
in
the
past
shall
show
me
in
the
light
of
what
i
shall
see
among
them
now
i
need
trouble
you
with
oh
yes
she
interposed
i
do
not
expect
to
preach
at
once
but
only
to
teach
in
one
of
the
public
schools
where
i
have
heard
of
a
vacancy
and
and
perhaps
otherwise
with
those
whose
lives
are
made
up
of
hard
work
there
must
be
room
for
willing
and
peaceful
service
and
if
it
should
be
necessary
that
i
should
work
in
the
mills
in
order
to
render
this
then
i
will
do
so
but
at
present
i
have
another
way
in
view
a
social
way
that
shall
bring
me
into
immediate
relations
with
the
she
still
tried
to
argue
with
him
to
prove
him
wrong
in
going
away
but
they
both
ended
where
they
began
he
would
not
or
could
not
explain
himself
further
at
last
he
said
but
i
did
not
come
to
urge
this
matter
i
have
no
wish
to
impose
my
will
my
theory
upon
any
one
even
my
own
oh
yes
idella
annie
broke
in
anxiously
you
will
leave
her
with
me
peck
wo
you
you
do
know
how
much
i
attached
to
her
i
see
her
faults
and
i
shall
not
spoil
her
leave
her
with
me
at
least
till
you
see
your
way
clear
to
having
her
with
you
and
then
i
will
send
her
to
a
trouble
showed
itself
in
his
face
ordinarily
so
impassive
and
he
seemed
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
her
but
he
said
i
appreciate
your
kindness
to
her
but
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
be
at
the
inconvenience
longer
than
till
i
have
arranged
with
another
to
take
her
until
i
am
settled
and
then
bring
her
to
annie
sat
intensely
searching
his
face
with
her
lips
parted
to
speak
she
said
and
the
wounded
feeling
the
resentment
of
his
insensibility
to
her
that
mingled
in
her
heart
must
have
made
itself
felt
in
her
voice
for
he
went
on
reluctantly
it
is
a
family
in
which
she
will
be
brought
up
to
work
and
to
be
helpful
to
herself
they
will
join
me
with
her
you
know
the
mother
she
has
lost
her
own
child
at
the
name
annie
spirit
fell
the
tears
started
from
her
eyes
yes
she
must
have
her
it
is
just
it
is
the
only
expiation
do
you
remember
that
it
was
i
who
sent
savor
baby
to
the
where
it
died
no
i
had
forgotten
said
the
minister
aghast
i
am
sorry
it
does
matter
said
annie
lifelessly
it
had
to
after
a
pause
she
asked
quietly
if
savor
is
going
to
work
in
the
mills
how
can
she
make
a
home
for
the
child
she
is
not
going
into
the
mills
he
answered
she
will
keep
house
for
us
all
and
we
hope
to
have
others
who
are
without
homes
of
their
own
join
us
in
paying
the
expenses
and
doing
the
work
so
that
all
may
share
its
comfort
without
gain
to
any
one
upon
their
necessity
of
food
and
she
did
not
heed
his
explanation
but
suddenly
entreated
let
me
go
with
you
i
will
not
be
a
trouble
to
you
and
i
will
help
as
well
as
i
can
i
ca
give
the
child
up
why
why
the
thought
crazy
as
it
would
have
once
seemed
was
now
such
a
happy
solution
of
the
trouble
that
she
smiled
hopefully
why
should
i
go
with
and
savor
and
help
to
make
a
home
for
idella
there
you
will
need
money
to
begin
your
work
i
will
give
you
mine
i
will
give
it
up
i
will
give
it
all
up
i
will
give
it
to
any
good
object
that
you
approve
or
you
may
have
it
to
do
what
you
think
best
with
and
i
will
go
with
idella
and
i
will
work
in
the
mills
there
or
he
shook
his
head
and
for
the
first
time
in
their
acquaintance
he
seemed
to
feel
compassion
for
her
it
is
possible
i
could
take
your
money
i
should
know
what
to
do
with
you
know
what
to
do
with
your
own
she
broke
in
you
do
good
with
that
i
afraid
i
do
harm
with
it
too
he
returned
it
only
a
little
but
little
as
it
has
been
i
can
no
longer
meet
the
responsibility
it
but
if
you
took
my
money
she
urged
you
could
devote
your
life
to
preaching
the
truth
to
writing
and
publishing
books
and
all
that
and
so
could
others
do
you
see
he
shook
his
head
perhaps
others
but
i
have
done
with
preaching
for
the
present
later
i
may
have
something
to
say
now
i
feel
sure
of
nothing
not
even
of
what
i
been
saying
will
you
send
for
idella
when
she
goes
with
the
savors
i
will
come
too
he
looked
at
her
sorrowfully
i
think
you
are
a
good
woman
and
you
mean
what
you
say
but
i
am
sorry
you
say
it
if
any
words
of
mine
have
caused
you
to
say
it
for
i
know
you
can
not
do
it
even
for
me
it
is
hard
to
go
back
to
those
associations
and
for
you
they
would
be
you
will
see
she
returned
with
exaltation
i
will
take
idella
to
the
savors
or
no
i
have
them
come
here
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
perplexity
at
last
he
asked
could
i
see
the
child
certainly
said
annie
with
the
lofty
passion
that
possessed
her
and
she
led
him
up
into
the
chamber
where
idella
lay
sleeping
in
annie
own
crib
he
stood
beside
it
gazing
long
at
the
little
one
from
whose
eyes
he
shaded
the
lamp
then
he
said
i
thank
you
and
turned
away
she
followed
him
and
at
the
door
she
said
you
think
i
will
not
come
but
i
will
come
do
you
believe
that
he
turned
sadly
from
her
you
might
come
but
you
could
stay
you
know
what
it
is
you
ca
imagine
it
and
you
could
bear
i
will
come
and
i
will
stay
she
answered
and
when
he
was
gone
she
fell
into
one
of
those
intense
reveries
of
hers
a
rapture
in
which
she
prefigured
what
should
happen
in
that
new
life
before
her
at
its
end
peck
stood
beside
her
grave
reading
the
lesson
of
her
work
to
the
multitude
of
grateful
and
loving
poor
who
thronged
to
pay
the
last
tribute
to
her
memory
putney
was
there
with
his
wife
and
lyra
regretful
of
her
lightness
and
munger
repentant
of
her
mendacities
they
talked
together
in
murmurs
of
the
noble
career
just
ended
she
heard
their
voices
and
then
she
began
to
ask
herself
what
they
would
really
say
of
her
proposing
to
go
to
fall
river
with
the
savors
and
be
a
xxvii
annie
did
not
sleep
after
lying
a
long
time
awake
she
took
some
of
the
tonic
that
morrell
had
left
her
upon
the
chance
that
it
might
quiet
her
but
it
did
no
good
she
dressed
herself
and
sat
by
the
window
till
morning
the
breaking
day
showed
her
purposes
grotesque
and
monstrous
the
revulsion
that
must
come
came
with
a
tide
that
swept
before
it
all
prepossessions
all
affections
it
seemed
as
if
the
child
still
asleep
in
her
crib
had
heard
what
she
said
and
would
help
to
hold
her
to
her
word
she
choked
down
a
crust
of
bread
with
the
coffee
she
drank
at
breakfast
and
instead
of
romping
with
idella
at
her
bath
she
dressed
the
little
one
silently
and
sent
her
out
to
bolton
then
she
sat
down
again
in
the
sort
of
daze
in
which
she
had
spent
the
night
and
as
the
day
passed
her
revolt
from
what
she
had
pledged
herself
to
do
mounted
and
mounted
it
was
like
the
sort
of
woman
she
was
not
to
think
of
any
withdrawal
from
her
pledges
they
were
all
the
more
sacred
with
her
because
they
had
been
purely
voluntary
insistent
the
fact
that
they
had
been
refused
made
them
the
more
obligatory
she
thought
some
one
would
come
to
break
in
upon
the
heavy
monotony
of
the
time
she
expected
ralph
or
ellen
or
at
least
lyra
but
she
only
saw
bolton
and
heard
her
about
her
work
sometimes
the
child
stole
back
from
the
kitchen
or
the
barn
and
peeped
in
upon
her
with
a
roguish
expectance
which
her
gloomy
stare
defeated
and
then
it
ran
off
again
she
lay
down
in
the
afternoon
and
tried
to
sleep
but
her
brain
was
inexorably
alert
and
she
lay
making
inventory
of
all
the
pleasant
things
she
was
to
leave
for
that
ugly
fate
she
had
insisted
on
a
swarm
of
fancies
gave
every
detail
of
the
parting
dramatic
intensity
amidst
the
poignancy
of
her
regrets
her
shame
for
her
recreancy
was
sharper
still
by
night
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
it
was
morrell
custom
to
come
nearly
every
night
but
she
was
afraid
because
he
had
walked
home
with
her
from
the
meeting
the
night
before
he
might
not
come
now
and
she
sent
for
him
it
was
in
quality
of
as
well
as
physician
that
she
wished
to
see
him
she
meant
to
tell
him
all
that
had
passed
with
peck
and
this
was
perfectly
easy
in
the
interview
she
forecast
but
at
the
sound
of
his
buggy
wheels
in
the
lane
a
thought
came
that
seemed
to
forbid
her
even
to
speak
of
peck
to
him
for
the
first
time
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
minister
might
have
inferred
a
meaning
from
her
eagerness
and
persistence
infinitely
more
preposterous
than
even
the
preposterous
letter
of
her
words
a
number
of
little
proofs
of
the
conjecture
flashed
upon
her
his
anxiety
to
get
away
from
her
his
refusal
to
let
her
believe
in
her
own
constancy
of
purpose
his
moments
of
bewilderment
and
dismay
it
needed
nothing
but
this
to
add
the
touch
of
intolerable
absurdity
to
the
horror
of
the
whole
affair
and
to
snatch
the
last
hope
of
help
from
her
she
let
bolton
go
to
the
door
and
she
did
not
rise
to
meet
the
doctor
she
saw
from
his
smile
that
he
knew
he
had
a
moral
rather
than
a
physical
trouble
to
deal
with
but
she
did
not
relax
the
severity
of
her
glare
in
sympathy
as
she
was
tempted
from
some
infinite
remoteness
to
do
when
he
said
you
not
well
she
whispered
solemnly
back
not
at
he
did
not
pursue
his
inquiry
into
her
condition
but
said
with
an
irrelevant
cheerfulness
that
piqued
her
i
was
coming
here
this
evening
at
any
rate
and
i
got
your
message
on
the
way
up
from
my
you
are
very
kind
she
said
a
little
more
audibly
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
went
on
of
what
a
time
putney
and
i
have
had
working
up
public
sentiment
for
peck
so
as
to
keep
him
annie
did
not
change
her
position
but
the
expression
of
her
glance
changed
we
been
round
in
the
enemy
camp
everywhere
and
i
committed
gerrish
himself
to
an
armed
neutrality
that
was
difficult
the
difficulty
was
in
another
quarter
with
peck
himself
he
more
opposed
than
any
one
else
to
his
stay
in
hatboro
you
know
he
intended
going
away
this
morning
did
he
annie
asked
dishonestly
the
question
obliged
her
to
say
something
yes
he
came
to
putney
before
breakfast
to
thank
him
and
take
leave
of
him
and
to
tell
him
of
the
plan
he
had
for
imagine
what
i
do
know
said
annie
hoarsely
after
an
effort
as
if
the
untruth
would
not
come
easily
i
am
worse
than
munger
she
thought
for
going
to
fall
river
to
teach
school
among
the
children
and
to
open
a
for
the
hands
the
doctor
waited
for
her
sensation
and
in
its
absence
he
looked
so
disappointed
that
she
was
forced
to
say
to
teach
school
then
he
went
on
briskly
again
yes
putney
laboured
with
him
on
his
knees
so
to
speak
and
got
him
to
postpone
his
going
till
morning
and
then
he
came
to
me
for
help
we
enlisted
wilmington
in
the
cause
and
we
spent
the
day
working
up
the
peck
sentiment
to
a
been
a
very
queer
campaign
three
gentiles
toiling
for
a
saint
against
the
elect
and
bringing
them
all
over
at
last
we
got
a
paper
signed
by
a
large
majority
of
the
members
of
the
church
the
church
not
the
society
asking
peck
to
remain
and
putney
gone
to
him
with
the
paper
and
he
coming
round
here
to
report
peck
decision
we
all
agreed
that
it
would
do
to
say
anything
about
his
plan
for
the
future
and
i
fancy
some
of
his
people
signed
our
petition
under
the
impression
that
they
were
keeping
a
valuable
man
out
of
another
annie
accompanied
the
doctor
words
which
she
took
in
to
the
last
syllable
with
a
symphony
of
conjecture
as
to
how
the
change
in
plans
if
they
prevailed
with
him
would
affect
her
and
the
doctor
had
not
ceased
to
speak
before
she
perceived
that
it
would
be
deliverance
perfect
and
complete
however
inglorious
but
the
tacit
drama
so
vividly
preoccupied
her
with
its
minor
questions
of
how
to
descend
to
this
escape
with
dignity
that
still
she
did
not
speak
and
he
took
up
the
word
again
i
confess
i
had
my
misgivings
about
peck
and
about
his
final
usefulness
in
a
community
like
this
in
spite
of
all
that
putney
can
say
of
his
i
afraid
that
he
a
good
deal
of
a
dreamer
but
i
gave
way
to
putney
and
i
hope
you
appreciate
what
i
done
for
your
you
are
very
good
she
said
in
mechanical
acknowledgment
her
mind
was
set
so
strenuously
to
break
from
her
dishonest
reticence
that
she
did
not
know
really
what
she
was
saying
why
why
do
you
call
him
a
dreamer
she
cast
about
in
that
direction
at
random
why
well
for
one
thing
the
reason
he
gave
putney
for
giving
up
his
luxuries
here
that
as
long
as
there
was
hardship
and
overwork
for
underpay
in
the
world
he
must
share
them
it
seems
to
me
that
i
might
as
well
say
that
as
long
as
there
were
dyspepsia
and
rheumatism
in
the
world
i
must
share
them
then
he
has
a
queer
notion
that
he
can
go
back
and
find
instruction
in
the
that
they
alone
have
the
light
and
the
truth
and
know
the
meaning
of
life
i
do
say
anything
against
them
my
observation
and
my
experience
is
that
if
others
were
as
good
as
they
are
in
the
ratio
of
their
advantages
peck
need
go
to
them
for
his
ideal
but
their
conditions
warp
and
dull
them
they
see
things
askew
and
they
do
see
them
clearly
i
might
as
well
expose
myself
to
the
in
hopes
of
treating
my
more
she
could
not
perceive
where
his
analogies
rang
false
they
only
overwhelmed
her
with
a
deeper
sense
of
her
own
folly
but
i
do
know
he
went
on
that
a
dreamer
is
such
a
desperate
character
if
you
can
only
keep
him
from
trying
to
realise
his
dreams
and
if
peck
consents
to
stay
in
hatboro
perhaps
we
can
manage
he
drew
his
chair
a
little
toward
the
lounge
where
she
reclined
and
asked
with
the
kindliness
that
was
both
personal
and
professional
what
seems
to
be
the
matter
she
started
up
there
is
nothing
nothing
that
medicine
can
help
why
do
you
call
him
my
favourite
she
demanded
violently
but
you
have
wasted
your
time
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
what
you
say
he
would
never
give
it
up
never
in
the
world
she
added
hysterically
if
you
interfered
between
any
one
and
his
duty
in
this
world
where
it
seems
as
if
hardly
any
one
had
any
duty
you
done
a
very
unwarrantable
she
was
aware
from
his
stare
that
her
words
were
incoherent
if
not
from
the
words
themselves
but
she
hurried
on
i
am
going
with
him
he
was
here
last
night
and
i
told
him
i
would
i
will
go
with
the
savors
and
we
will
keep
the
child
together
and
if
they
will
take
me
i
shall
go
to
work
in
the
mills
and
i
shall
not
care
what
people
think
if
it
right
she
stopped
and
weakly
dropped
back
on
the
lounge
and
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
i
really
do
the
doctor
began
with
a
carefulness
to
unwind
the
coil
she
had
flung
down
to
him
are
the
savors
going
and
the
child
he
will
give
her
the
child
for
the
one
they
lost
you
know
how
and
they
will
take
it
with
but
you
what
have
you
i
must
have
the
child
too
i
ca
give
it
up
and
i
shall
go
with
them
there
no
other
way
you
do
know
i
given
him
my
word
and
there
is
no
hope
he
asked
you
said
the
doctor
to
make
sure
he
had
heard
aright
he
asked
you
advised
you
to
go
to
work
in
a
no
she
lifted
her
face
to
confront
him
he
told
me
to
go
but
i
said
i
they
sat
staring
at
each
other
in
a
silence
which
neither
of
them
broke
and
which
promised
to
last
indefinitely
they
were
still
in
their
daze
when
putney
voice
came
through
the
open
hall
door
hello
hello
hello
hello
central
i
make
you
hear
any
one
his
steps
advanced
into
the
hall
and
he
put
his
head
in
at
the
library
doorway
thought
you
be
here
he
said
nodding
at
the
doctor
well
doctor
brother
peck
beaten
us
again
he
going
the
doctor
echoed
yes
it
no
use
i
put
the
whole
case
before
him
and
i
argued
it
with
a
force
of
logic
that
would
have
fetched
the
twelfth
man
with
eleven
stubborn
fellows
against
him
on
a
jury
but
it
did
fetch
brother
peck
he
was
very
appreciative
and
grateful
but
he
believes
he
got
a
call
to
give
up
the
ministry
for
the
present
at
least
well
there
some
consolation
in
supposing
he
may
know
best
after
all
it
seemed
to
us
that
he
had
a
great
opportunity
in
hatboro
but
if
he
turns
his
back
on
it
perhaps
it
a
sign
he
was
equal
to
it
the
doctor
told
you
what
we
been
up
to
annie
yes
she
answered
faintly
from
the
depths
of
the
labyrinth
in
which
she
was
plunged
again
i
sorry
for
your
news
about
him
said
the
doctor
i
hoped
he
was
going
to
stay
it
always
a
pity
when
such
a
man
lets
his
sympathies
use
him
instead
of
using
them
but
we
must
always
judge
that
kind
of
crank
leniently
if
he
does
involve
other
people
in
his
she
knew
that
he
was
shielding
and
trying
to
spare
her
and
she
felt
inexpressibly
degraded
by
the
terms
of
his
forbearance
she
could
not
accept
and
she
had
not
the
strength
to
refuse
it
and
putney
said
not
seen
anything
to
make
me
doubt
his
sanity
but
i
must
say
the
present
racket
shakes
my
faith
in
his
and
i
rather
held
by
that
you
know
but
i
suppose
no
man
except
the
kind
of
a
man
that
a
woman
would
be
if
she
were
a
man
excuse
me
annie
is
ever
absolutely
right
i
suppose
the
truth
is
a
constitutional
thing
and
you
ca
separate
it
from
the
personal
consciousness
and
so
you
get
it
coloured
and
heated
by
personality
when
you
get
it
fresh
that
is
we
can
see
what
the
absolute
truth
was
but
never
what
it
putney
amused
himself
in
speculating
on
these
lines
with
more
or
less
reference
to
peck
and
did
not
notice
that
the
doctor
and
annie
gave
him
only
a
silent
assent
as
to
misleading
any
one
else
following
in
his
new
religion
seems
to
be
confined
to
the
savors
as
i
understand
they
are
going
with
him
to
help
him
set
up
a
sort
of
cooperative
well
i
do
know
where
we
shall
get
a
hotter
gospeller
than
brother
peck
poor
old
fellow
i
hope
he
get
along
better
in
fall
river
it
is
something
to
be
out
of
reach
of
the
doctor
asked
when
is
he
going
why
he
gone
by
this
time
i
suppose
said
putney
i
tried
to
get
him
to
think
about
it
overnight
but
he
would
he
anxious
to
go
and
get
back
so
as
to
preach
his
last
sermon
here
sunday
and
he
taken
the
if
he
has
changed
his
putney
looked
at
his
watch
let
hope
he
has
said
morrell
which
asked
putney
changed
his
mind
i
sorry
he
coming
annie
knew
that
he
was
talking
at
her
though
he
spoke
to
putney
but
she
was
powerless
to
protest
xxviii
they
went
away
together
leaving
her
to
her
despair
which
had
passed
into
a
sort
of
torpor
by
the
following
night
when
morrell
came
again
out
of
what
she
knew
must
be
mere
humanity
he
could
not
respect
her
any
longer
he
told
her
as
if
for
her
comfort
that
putney
had
gone
to
the
depot
to
meet
peck
who
was
expected
back
in
the
train
and
was
to
labour
with
him
all
night
long
if
necessary
to
get
him
to
change
or
at
least
postpone
his
purpose
the
feeling
in
his
favour
was
growing
putney
hoped
to
put
it
so
strongly
to
him
as
a
proof
of
duty
that
he
could
not
resist
it
annie
listened
comfortlessly
whatever
happened
nothing
could
take
away
the
shame
of
her
weakness
now
she
even
wished
feebly
vaguely
that
she
might
be
forced
to
keep
her
word
a
sound
of
running
on
the
outside
and
a
sharp
pull
at
the
seemed
to
jerk
them
both
to
their
feet
some
one
stepped
into
the
hall
panting
and
the
face
of
william
savor
showed
itself
at
the
door
of
the
room
where
they
stood
doc
doctor
morrell
come
come
quick
there
been
an
accident
at
the
depot
peck
he
panted
out
the
story
and
annie
saw
rather
than
heard
how
the
minister
tried
to
cross
the
track
from
his
train
where
it
had
halted
short
of
the
station
and
the
flying
express
from
the
other
quarter
caught
him
from
his
feet
and
dropped
the
bleeding
fragment
that
still
held
his
life
beside
the
rail
a
hundred
yards
away
and
then
kept
on
in
brute
ignorance
into
the
night
where
is
he
where
have
you
got
him
the
doctor
demanded
of
savor
at
my
the
doctor
ran
out
of
the
house
and
she
heard
his
buggy
whirl
away
followed
by
the
fainter
sound
of
savor
feet
as
he
followed
running
after
he
had
stopped
to
repeat
his
story
to
the
boltons
annie
turned
to
the
farmer
mr
bolton
get
the
i

his
wife

bolton

little

bolton
annie
called
from
the
stairs
which
she
had
already
mounted
she
caught
up
the
child
limp
with
sleep
from
its
crib
and
began
to
dress
it
idella
cried
and
fought
away
the
hands
that
tormented
her
and
made
herself
now
very
stiff
and
now
very
lax
but
annie
and
bolton
together
prevailed
against
her
and
she
was
dressed
and
had
fallen
asleep
again
in
her
clothes
while
the
women
were
putting
on
their
hats
and
sacks
and
bolton
was
driving
up
to
the
door
with
the
why
i
can
see
he
said
when
he
got
out
to
help
them
in
just
how
william
got
his
idee
about
it
his
wife
an
excitable
kind
of
a
woman
and
she
sent
him
off
after
the
doctor
without
looking
to
see
what
the
matter
was
there
hai
never
been
anybody
hurt
at
our
depot
and
it
do
stand
to
reason

his

pauliny

soon
i
out
the
lane
you
i
drive
bolton
kept
a
grim
silence
against
which
her
husband
babble
of
optimism
played
like
on
a
night
sky
idella
woke
with
the
rush
of
cold
air
and
in
the
dark
and
strangeness
began
to
cry
and
wailed
between
her
fits
of
louder
sobbing
and
then
fell
asleep
again
before
they
reached
the
house
where
her
father
lay
dying
they
had
put
him
in
the
best
bed
in
savor
little
and
when
annie
entered
the
minister
was
apologising
to
her
for
spoiling
it
now
do
you
say
one
word
peck
she
answered
him
it
all
right
i
ruthah
see
you
layin
there
just
you
be
than
plenty
of
folks
that
she
stopped
for
want
of
an
apt
comparison
and
at
sight
of
annie
she
said
as
if
he
were
a
child
whose
mind
was
wandering
well
i
declare
if
here
ai
miss
kilburn
come
to
see
you
peck
and
mis
bolton
well
the
land
savor
came
and
shook
hands
with
them
and
in
her
character
of
hostess
urged
them
forward
from
the
door
where
they
had
halted
want
to
see
peck
well
he
real
now
ai
he
morrell
we
got
him
all
fixed
up
nicely
and
he
ai
in
a
bit
o
pain
it
his
spine
that
hurt
he
do
feel
nothin
but
he
just
as
clear
in
his
mind
as
what
you
or
i
be
he
doctor
he
not
suffering
said
morrell
to
whom
annie
eye
wandered
from
savor
and
there
was
something
in
his
manner
that
made
her
think
the
minister
was
not
badly
hurt
she
went
forward
with
and
bolton
and
after
they
had
both
taken
the
limp
hand
that
lay
outside
the
covering
she
touched
it
too
it
returned
no
pressure
but
his
large
wan
eyes
looked
at
her
with
such
gentle
dignity
and
intelligence
that
she
began
to
frame
in
her
mind
an
excuse
for
what
seemed
almost
an
intrusion
we
were
afraid
you
were
hurt
badly
and
we
thought
we
thought
you
might
like
to
see
idella
and
so
we
came
she
is
in
the
next
thank
you
said
the
minister
i
presume
that
i
am
dying
the
doctor
tells
me
that
i
have
but
a
few
hours
to
savor
protested
oh
i
guess
you
ai
to
die
time
annie
looked
from
morrell
to
putney
who
stood
with
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
experienced
a
shock
from
their
gravity
without
yet
being
able
to
accept
the
fact
it
implied
plenty
of
folks
continued
savor
hurt
what
you
be
alive
and
as
well
as
ever
they
bolton
seized
his
chance
it
just
what
i
said
to
pauliny
comin
along
see
said
i
peck
be
out
as
spry
as
any
of
us
before
a
great
while
that
the
way
i
felt
about
it
from
the
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
keep
up
courage
said
savor
that
so
that
half
the
battle
said
bolton
there
were
numbers
of
people
in
the
room
and
at
the
door
of
the
next
annie
saw
colonel
marvin
and
jack
wilmington
she
heard
afterward
that
he
was
going
to
take
the
same
train
to
boston
with
peck
and
had
helped
to
bring
him
to
the
savors
house
the
stationmaster
was
there
and
some
other
railroad
employes
the
doctor
leaned
across
the
bed
and
lifted
slightly
the
arm
that
lay
there
taking
the
wrist
between
his
thumb
and
finger
i
think
we
had
better
let
peck
rest
a
while
he
said
to
the
company
generally
doing
him
no
the
people
began
to
go
some
of
them
said
well
good
night
as
if
they
would
meet
again
in
the
morning
they
all
made
the
pretence
that
it
was
a
slight
matter
and
treated
the
wounded
man
as
if
he
were
a
child
he
did
not
humour
the
pretence
but
said
in
return
for
their
good
night
with
a
quiet
patience
savor
hastened
after
her
retreating
guests
i
ai
to
let
you
go
without
a
sup
of
coffee
she
said
i
want
you
should
all
stay
and
git
some
and
i
do
believe
but
what
a
little
of
it
would
do
peck
the
surface
of
her
lugubrious
nature
was
broken
up
and
whatever
was
kindly
and
cheerful
in
its
depths
floated
to
the
top
she
was
almost
gay
in
the
demand
which
the
calamity
made
upon
her
annie
knew
that
she
must
have
seen
and
helped
to
soothe
the
horror
of
mutilation
which
she
could
not
even
let
her
fancy
figure
and
she
followed
her
foolish
bustle
and
chatter
with
respectful
awe
rebecca
have
it
right
off
the
stove
in
half
a
minute
now
savor
concluded
and
from
a
further
room
came
the
cheerful
click
of
cups
and
then
a
wandering
whiff
of
the
coffee
life
in
its
vulgar
kindliness
touched
and
made
friends
with
death
claiming
it
a
part
of
nature
too
the
night
at
munger
came
back
to
annie
from
the
immeasurable
remoteness
into
which
all
the
past
had
lapsed
she
looked
up
at
morrell
across
the
bed
would
you
like
to
speak
with
peck
he
asked
officially
better
do
it
now
he
said
with
one
of
his
short
nods
putney
came
and
set
her
a
chair
she
would
have
liked
to
fall
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
but
she
took
the
chair
and
drew
the
minister
hand
into
hers
stretching
her
arm
above
his
head
on
the
pillow
he
lay
like
some
poor
little
wounded
boy
like
putney
winthrop
the
mother
that
is
in
every
woman
heart
gushed
out
of
hers
in
pity
upon
him
mixed
with
filial
reverence
she
had
thought
that
she
should
confess
her
baseness
to
him
and
ask
his
forgiveness
and
offer
to
fulfil
with
the
people
he
had
chosen
for
the
guardians
of
his
child
that
interrupted
purpose
of
his
but
in
the
presence
of
death
so
august
so
simple
all
the
concerns
of
life
seemed
trivial
and
she
found
herself
without
words
she
sobbed
over
the
poor
hand
she
held
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
and
tried
to
speak
but
his
lips
only
let
out
a
moaning
shuddering
sound
inarticulate
of
all
that
she
hoped
or
feared
he
might
prophesy
to
shape
her
future
life
alone
has
any
message
for
life
but
from
the
beginning
of
time
it
has
put
its
ear
to
the
cold
lips
that
must
for
ever
remain
dumb
xxix
the
evening
after
the
funeral
annie
took
idella
with
the
child
clothes
and
toys
in
a
bundle
and
bolton
drove
them
down
over
the
track
to
the
savors
she
had
thought
it
all
out
and
she
perceived
that
whatever
the
minister
final
intention
might
have
been
she
was
bound
by
the
purpose
he
had
expressed
to
her
and
must
give
up
the
child
for
fear
she
might
be
acting
from
the
false
conscientiousness
of
which
she
was
beginning
to
have
some
notion
in
herself
she
put
the
case
to
bolton
she
knew
what
she
must
do
in
any
event
but
it
was
a
comfort
to
be
stayed
so
firmly
in
her
duty
by
bolton
who
did
not
spare
some
doubts
of
savor
fitness
for
the
charge
and
reflected
a
subdued
censure
even
upon
the
judgment
of
peck
himself
as
she
bustled
about
and
helped
annie
get
idella
and
her
belongings
ready
the
child
watched
the
preparations
with
suspicion
at
the
end
when
she
was
dressed
and
annie
tried
to
lift
her
into
the
carriage
she
broke
out
in
sudden
rebellion
she
cried
she
shrieked
she
fought
the
two
good
women
who
were
obeying
the
dead
minister
behest
were
obliged
to
descend
to
the
foolish
lies
of
the
nursery
they
told
her
she
was
going
on
a
visit
to
the
savors
who
would
take
her
on
the
cars
with
them
and
then
bring
her
back
to
aunt
annie
house
before
they
could
reconcile
her
to
this
fabled
prospect
they
had
to
give
it
verisimilitude
by
taking
off
her
everyday
clothes
and
putting
on
her
best
dress
she
did
not
like
savor
house
when
she
came
to
it
nor
savor
who
stopped
all
blowzed
and
from
trying
to
put
it
in
order
after
the
death
in
it
and
gave
idella
a
motherly
welcome
annie
fancied
a
certain
surprise
in
her
manner
and
her
own
ideal
of
duty
was
put
to
proof
by
savor
owning
that
she
had
not
expected
annie
to
bring
idella
to
her
right
away
if
i
had
not
done
it
at
once
i
never
could
have
done
it
annie
explained
well
i
presume
it
a
cross
said
savor
and
i
do
feel
right
to
take
her
if
it
for
what
her
father
annie
said
with
a
significant
glance
it
an
ugly
house
screamed
the
child
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
aunt
annie
house
i
want
to
go
on
the
yes
yes
answered
savor
blindly
groping
to
share
in
whatever
cheat
had
been
practised
on
the
child
just
as
soon
as
the
cars
starts
here
william
you
take
her
out
and
show
her
the
pretty
coop
you
makin
the
pigeons
to
keep
the
cats
they
got
rid
of
her
with
savor
connivance
for
the
moment
and
annie
hastened
to
escape
we
had
to
tell
her
she
was
going
a
journey
or
we
never
could
have
got
her
into
the
carriage
she
explained
feeling
like
a
thief
yes
yes
it
all
right
said
savor
i
see
you
putting
up
some
kind
of
job
on
her
the
minute
she
mentioned
the
cars
do
you
fret
any
miss
kilburn
rebecca
and
me
get
along
with
her
you
need
be
annie
could
not
look
at
the
empty
crib
where
it
stood
in
its
alcove
when
she
went
to
bed
and
she
cried
upon
her
own
pillow
with
for
the
child
and
with
a
humiliating
doubt
of
her
own
part
in
hurrying
to
give
it
up
without
thought
of
savor
convenience
what
had
seemed
so
noble
so
exemplary
began
to
wear
another
colour
and
she
drowsed
worn
out
at
last
by
the
swarming
fears
shames
and
despairs
which
resolved
themselves
into
a
fantastic
medley
of
dream
images
there
was
a
cat
trying
to
get
at
the
pigeons
in
the
coop
which
savor
had
carried
idella
to
see
it
clawed
and
miauled
at
the
of
lath
and
its
caterwauling
became
like
the
cry
of
a
child
so
like
that
it
woke
annie
from
her
sleep
and
still
kept
on
she
lay
shuddering
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
dead
minister
ghost
flitted
from
the
room
while
the
crying
defined
and
located
itself
more
and
more
till
she
knew
it
a
child
wail
at
the
door
of
her
house
then
she
heard
aunt
annie
aunt
annie
and
soft
faint
thumps
as
of
a
little
fist
upon
the
door
panels
she
had
no
experience
of
more
than
one
motion
from
her
bed
to
the
door
which
the
same
impulse
flung
open
and
let
her
crush
to
her
breast
the
little
tumult
of
sobs
and
moans
from
the
threshold
oh
wicked
selfish
heartless
wretch
she
stormed
out
over
the
child
but
now
i
will
never
never
never
give
you
up
oh
my
poor
little
baby
my
darling
god
has
sent
you
back
to
me
and
i
will
keep
you
i
do
care
what
happens
what
a
cruel
wretch
i
have
been
oh
what
a
cruel
wretch
my
pretty
to
tear
you
from
your
home
but
now
you
shall
never
leave
it
no
one
shall
take
you
she
gripped
it
in
a
succession
of
fierce
hugs
and
mumbled
it
face
and
neck
and
little
cold
wet
hands
and
feet
with
her
kisses
and
all
the
time
she
did
not
know
the
child
was
in
its
like
herself
or
that
her
own
feet
were
bare
and
her
drapery
as
scanty
as
idella
a
sense
of
the
fact
evanescently
gleamed
upon
her
with
the
appearance
of
bolton
lamp
in
hand
and
the
instantaneous
appearance
and
disappearance
of
her
husband
at
the
back
door
through
which
she
emerged
the
two
women
spent
the
first
moments
of
the
in
making
certain
that
idella
was
sound
and
whole
in
every
part
and
then
in
making
uncertain
for
ever
how
she
came
to
be
there
whether
she
had
wandered
out
in
her
sleep
and
found
her
way
home
with
feet
or
whether
she
had
watched
till
the
house
was
quiet
and
then
stolen
away
was
what
she
could
not
tell
them
and
must
always
remain
a
mystery
i
do
believe
but
what
bolton
had
better
go
and
wake
up
the
savors
you
got
to
keep
her
for
the
night
i
presume
but
they
ought
to
know
where
she
is
and
you
can
take
her
over
there
agin
come
bolton
shouted
annie
in
a
voice
so
deep
and
hoarse
that
it
shook
the
heart
of
a
woman
who
had
never
known
fear
of
man
if
you
say
such
a
thing
to
me
if
you
ever
say
such
a
thing
again
i
i
i
will
you
send
bolton
for
idella
things
right
away
land
said
savor
when
bolton
after
a
long
conciliatory
preamble
explained
that
he
did
not
believe
miss
kilburn
felt
a
great
deal
like
giving
the
child
up
again
do
want
it
without
it
satisfied
to
stay
i
see
last
night
it
was
just
breakin
its
heart
for
her
and
i
told
william
when
we
first
missed
her
this
mornin
and
he
was
in
such
a
pucker
about
her
i
bet
anything
he
was
a
mind
to
that
the
child
had
gone
back
to
miss
kilburn
that
just
the
words
i
used
did
i
rebecca
i
could
stand
it
to
have
no
child
beyond
this
sentimental
reluctance
savor
later
confessed
to
annie
herself
that
she
was
really
accepting
the
charge
of
idella
in
the
same
spirit
of
as
that
in
which
annie
was
surrendering
it
and
that
she
felt
when
peck
first
suggested
it
that
the
child
was
better
off
with
miss
kilburn
only
she
hated
to
say
so
her
husband
seemed
to
think
it
would
make
up
to
her
for
the
one
they
lost
but
nothing
could
really
do
that
xxx
in
a
reverie
of
rare
vividness
following
her
recovery
of
the
child
annie
kilburn
dramatised
an
escape
from
all
the
failures
and
humiliations
of
her
life
in
hatboro
she
took
idella
with
her
and
went
back
to
rome
accomplishing
the
whole
affair
so
smoothly
and
rapidly
that
she
wondered
at
herself
for
not
having
thought
of
such
a
simple
solution
of
her
difficulties
before
she
even
began
to
put
some
little
things
together
for
her
flight
while
she
explained
to
old
friends
in
the
american
colony
that
idella
was
the
orphan
child
of
a
country
minister
which
she
had
adopted
that
old
lady
who
had
found
her
motives
in
returning
to
insufficient
questioned
her
sharply
she
had
adopted
the
minister
child
and
did
not
find
her
answers
satisfactory
they
were
such
as
also
failed
to
pacify
inquiry
in
hatboro
where
annie
remained
in
spite
of
her
reverie
but
people
accepted
the
fact
and
accounted
for
it
in
their
own
way
and
approved
it
even
though
they
could
not
quite
approve
her
the
dramatic
impressiveness
of
the
minister
death
won
him
undisputed
favour
yet
it
failed
to
establish
unity
in
his
society
supply
after
supply
filled
his
pulpit
but
the
people
found
them
all
unsatisfactory
when
they
remembered
his
preaching
and
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
any
one
of
them
they
were
more
divided
than
ever
except
upon
the
point
of
regretting
peck
but
they
distinguished
in
honouring
his
memory
they
revered
his
goodness
and
his
wisdom
but
they
regarded
his
conduct
of
life
as
unpractical
they
said
there
never
was
a
more
inspired
teacher
but
it
was
impossible
to
follow
him
and
he
could
not
himself
have
kept
the
course
he
had
marked
out
they
said
now
that
he
was
beyond
recall
no
one
else
could
have
built
up
the
church
in
hatboro
as
he
could
if
he
could
only
have
let
impracticable
theories
alone
gerrish
called
many
people
to
witness
that
this
was
what
he
had
always
said
he
contended
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
which
you
were
to
follow
he
said
that
if
peck
had
gone
to
teaching
among
the
mill
hands
he
would
have
been
sick
of
it
inside
of
six
weeks
but
he
was
a
good
christian
man
and
no
one
wished
less
than
gerrish
to
reproach
him
for
what
was
after
all
more
an
error
of
the
head
than
the
heart
his
critics
had
it
their
own
way
in
this
for
he
had
not
lived
to
offer
that
full
exposition
of
his
theory
and
justification
of
his
purpose
which
he
had
been
expected
to
give
on
the
sunday
after
he
was
killed
and
his
death
was
in
no
wise
exegetic
it
said
no
more
to
his
people
than
it
had
said
to
annie
it
was
a
mere
casualty
and
his
past
life
broken
and
unfulfilled
with
only
its
intimations
and
intentions
of
performance
alone
remained
when
people
learned
as
they
could
hardly
help
doing
from
volubility
what
his
plan
with
regard
to
idella
had
been
they
instanced
that
in
proof
of
the
injuriousness
of
his
idealism
as
applied
to
real
life
and
they
held
that
she
had
been
remanded
in
that
strange
way
to
miss
kilburn
charge
for
some
purpose
which
she
must
not
attempt
to
cross
as
the
minister
had
been
thwarted
in
another
intent
by
death
it
was
a
sign
that
he
was
wrong
in
this
too
and
that
she
could
do
better
by
the
child
than
he
had
proposed
this
was
the
sum
of
popular
opinion
and
it
was
further
the
opinion
of
gerrish
who
gave
more
attention
to
the
case
than
many
others
that
annie
had
first
taken
the
child
because
she
hoped
to
get
peck
when
she
found
she
could
not
get
morrell
and
that
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
if
she
had
known
how
but
that
she
would
have
to
keep
it
now
for
shame
sake
for
shame
sake
certainly
annie
would
have
done
several
other
things
and
chief
of
these
would
have
been
never
to
see
morrell
again
she
believed
that
he
not
only
knew
the
folly
she
had
confessed
to
him
but
that
he
had
divined
the
cowardice
and
meanness
in
which
she
had
repented
it
and
she
felt
intolerably
disgraced
before
the
thought
of
him
she
had
imagined
mainly
because
of
him
that
escape
to
rome
which
never
has
yet
been
effected
though
it
might
have
been
attempted
if
idella
had
not
wakened
ill
from
the
sleep
she
sobbed
herself
into
when
she
found
herself
safe
in
annie
crib
again
she
had
taken
a
heavy
cold
and
she
moped
lifelessly
about
during
the
day
and
drowsed
early
again
in
the
troubled
slumber
that
child
ought
to
have
the
doctor
said
bolton
with
the
grim
impartiality
in
which
she
masked
her
interference
well
said
annie
helplessly
at
the
end
of
the
lung
fever
which
followed
it
was
a
narrow
chance
said
the
doctor
one
morning
but
now
i
need
come
any
more
unless
you
send
for
annie
stood
at
the
door
where
he
spoke
with
his
hand
on
the
of
his
buggy
before
getting
into
it
she
answered
with
one
of
those
impulses
that
come
from
something
deeper
than
intention
i
will
send
for
you
then
to
tell
you
how
generous
you
are
and
in
the
look
with
which
she
spoke
she
uttered
the
full
meaning
that
her
words
withheld
he
flushed
for
pleasure
of
conscious
desert
but
he
had
to
laugh
and
turn
it
off
lightly
i
do
think
i
could
come
for
that
but
i
look
in
to
see
idella
he
drove
away
and
she
remained
at
her
door
looking
up
at
the
summer
blue
sky
that
held
a
few
soft
white
clouds
such
as
might
have
overhung
the
same
place
at
the
same
hour
thousands
of
years
before
and
such
as
would
lazily
drift
over
it
in
a
thousand
years
to
come
the
morning
had
an
immeasurable
vastness
through
which
some
crows
flying
across
the
pasture
above
the
house
sent
their
voices
on
the
spacious
stillness
a
perception
of
the
unity
of
all
things
under
the
sun
flashed
and
faded
upon
her
as
such
glimpses
do
of
her
high
intentions
nothing
had
resulted
an
inexorable
centrifugality
had
thrown
her
off
at
every
point
where
she
tried
to
cling
nothing
of
what
was
established
and
regulated
had
desired
her
intervention
a
few
accidents
and
irregularities
had
alone
accepted
it
but
now
she
felt
that
nothing
withal
had
been
lost
a
magnitude
a
serenity
a
tolerance
intimated
itself
in
the
universal
frame
of
things
where
her
failure
her
recreancy
her
folly
seemed
for
the
moment
to
come
into
true
perspective
and
to
show
venial
and
unimportant
to
be
limited
to
itself
and
to
be
even
good
in
its
effect
of
humbling
her
to
patience
with
all
imperfection
and
shortcoming
even
her
own
she
was
aware
of
the
cessation
of
a
struggle
that
has
never
since
renewed
itself
with
the
old
intensity
her
wishes
her
propensities
ceased
in
that
degree
to
represent
evil
in
conflict
with
the
portion
of
good
in
her
they
seemed
so
mixed
and
interwoven
with
the
good
that
they
could
no
longer
be
antagonised
for
the
moment
they
seemed
in
their
way
even
wiser
and
better
and
ever
after
to
be
the
nature
out
of
which
good
as
well
as
evil
might
come
as
she
remained
standing
there
brandreth
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
looking
very
bright
and
happy
miss
kilburn
he
said
abruptly
i
want
you
to
congratulate
me
engaged
to
miss
are
you
indeed
brandreth
i
do
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
she
is
a
lovely
yes
it
all
right
now
said
brandreth
i
come
to
tell
you
the
first
one
because
you
seemed
to
take
an
interest
in
it
when
i
told
you
of
the
trouble
about
the
juliet
we
had
come
to
any
understanding
before
that
but
that
seemed
to
bring
us
both
to
the
point
and
and
engaged
mother
and
i
are
going
to
new
york
for
the
winter
we
think
she
can
risk
it
and
at
any
rate
she
wo
be
separated
from
me
and
we
shall
be
back
in
our
little
home
next
may
you
know
that
i
to
be
with
chapley
in
his
business
why
no
this
is
news
brandreth
i
do
know
what
to
you
very
kind
said
the
young
man
and
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
he
wrung
her
hand
it
is
a
partnership
of
course
but
he
thinks
i
can
be
of
use
to
i
know
you
can
annie
adventured
we
are
very
busy
getting
ready
nearly
everybody
else
is
gone
and
mother
sent
her
kindest
regards
you
know
she
do
make
calls
and
i
just
ran
up
to
tell
you
well
give
my
love
to
your
mother
and
to
miss
i
he
hurried
off
and
then
came
running
back
oh
i
forgot
about
the
social
union
fund
you
know
we
got
about
two
hundred
dollars
from
the
theatricals
but
the
matter
seems
to
have
stopped
there
and
some
of
us
think
there
better
be
some
other
disposition
of
the
money
have
you
any
suggestion
to
make
no
then
i
tell
you
it
proposed
to
devote
the
money
to
beautifying
the
grounds
around
the
soldiers
monument
they
ought
to
be
fenced
and
planted
with
flowers
turned
into
a
little
public
garden
everybody
appreciates
the
interest
you
took
in
the
union
and
we
hoped
you
be
pleased
with
that
disposition
of
the
it
is
very
kind
said
annie
with
a
meek
submission
that
must
have
made
him
believe
she
was
deeply
touched
as
i
not
to
be
here
this
winter
he
continued
we
thought
we
had
better
leave
the
whole
matter
in
your
hands
and
the
money
has
been
deposited
in
the
bank
subject
to
your
order
it
was
munger
idea
i
do
think
she
ever
felt
just
right
about
that
evening
of
the
dramatics
do
you
know
he
ran
off
to
escape
her
thanks
for
this
proof
of
confidence
in
her
taste
and
judgment
and
he
was
gone
beyond
her
protest
before
she
emerged
from
her
daze
into
a
full
sense
of
the
absurdity
of
the
situation
well
it
a
very
simple
matter
to
let
the
money
lie
in
the
bank
said
morrell
who
came
that
evening
to
make
his
first
unprofessional
visit
and
received
with
pure
amusement
the
account
of
the
affair
which
she
gave
him
with
a
strong
infusion
of
vexation
the
way
i
was
involved
in
this
odious
social
union
business
from
the
first
and
now
have
it
left
on
my
hands
in
the
end
is
maddening
why
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
she
replied
then
perhaps
he
comfortably
suggested
it
a
sign
you
not
intended
to
get
rid
of
what
you
mean
why
do
you
go
on
he
irresponsibly
adventured
further
and
establish
a
social
union
do
you
it
what
was
that
notion
of
his
they
usually
spoke
of
the
minister
pronominally
about
getting
the
savors
going
in
a
at
fall
river
putney
said
something
about
annie
explained
as
she
had
heard
it
from
him
and
from
the
savors
since
his
death
the
minister
scheme
for
a
club
in
which
the
members
should
contribute
the
labour
and
the
provisions
and
should
live
cheaply
and
wholesomely
under
the
management
of
the
savors
at
first
and
afterward
should
continue
them
in
charge
or
not
as
they
chose
he
seemed
to
have
thought
it
out
very
carefully
but
i
supposed
of
course
it
was
was
that
why
you
were
going
in
for
it
asked
the
doctor
and
then
he
spared
her
confusion
in
adding
i
do
see
why
it
was
unpractical
it
seems
to
me
a
very
good
notion
for
a
social
union
why
not
try
it
here
there
is
the
same
pressing
necessity
that
there
is
in
a
big
factory
town
but
you
have
the
money
and
you
have
the
savors
to
make
a
his
tone
was
still
half
bantering
but
it
had
become
more
and
more
serious
so
that
she
could
say
in
earnest
but
the
money
is
one
of
the
drawbacks
it
was
peck
idea
that
the
working
people
ought
to
do
it
all
well
i
should
say
that
of
that
money
in
the
bank
had
come
from
them
they
turned
out
in
great
force
to
brandreth
theatricals
and
would
it
be
rather
to
use
their
money
for
anything
but
the
union
you
do
suppose
said
annie
hotly
that
i
would
spend
a
cent
of
it
on
the
grounds
of
that
idiotic
monument
i
would
pay
for
having
it
blown
up
with
dynamite
no
i
ca
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
wretched
affair
my
touch
is
the
doctor
laughed
and
she
added
besides
i
believe
most
heartily
with
peck
that
no
person
of
means
and
leisure
can
meet
working
people
except
in
the
odious
character
of
a
patron
and
if
i
did
respect
them
i
respect
myself
too
much
for
that
if
i
were
ready
to
go
in
with
them
and
start
the
social
union
on
his
basis
by
helping
do
for
it
and
eating
and
living
with
them
i
might
try
but
i
know
from
experience
i
not
i
have
the
need
and
to
pretend
that
i
have
to
forego
my
comforts
and
luxuries
in
a
that
i
have
them
would
be
too
ghastly
a
farce
and
i
well
then
do
said
the
doctor
bent
more
perhaps
on
carrying
his
point
in
argument
than
on
promoting
the
actual
establishment
of
the
social
union
but
my
idea
is
this
take
or
of
that
money
and
go
to
savor
and
say
this
is
what
brandreth
theatricals
swindled
the
out
of
it
honestly
theirs
at
least
to
control
and
if
you
want
to
try
that
experiment
of
peck
here
in
hatboro
yours
we
people
of
leisure
or
comparative
leisure
have
really
nothing
in
common
with
you
people
who
work
with
your
hands
for
a
living
and
as
we
really
ca
be
friends
with
you
we
wo
patronise
you
we
wo
advise
you
and
we
wo
help
you
but
here
the
money
if
you
fail
you
fail
and
if
you
succeed
you
wo
succeed
by
our
aid
and
comfort
the
plan
that
annie
and
doctor
morrell
talked
over
half
in
joke
took
a
more
and
more
serious
character
in
her
sense
of
duty
to
the
minister
memory
and
the
wish
to
be
of
use
which
was
not
extinct
in
her
however
she
mocked
and
defied
it
it
was
part
of
the
irony
of
her
fate
that
the
people
who
were
best
able
to
counsel
with
her
in
regard
to
it
were
lyra
whom
she
could
not
approve
and
jack
wilmington
whom
she
had
always
disliked
he
was
able
to
contribute
some
facts
about
the
working
of
the
thayer
club
at
the
harvard
memorial
hall
in
cambridge
and
lyra
because
she
had
been
herself
a
hand
and
would
not
forget
it
was
of
use
in
bringing
the
scheme
into
favour
with
the
hands
they
felt
easy
with
her
as
they
did
with
putney
and
for
much
the
same
reason
it
is
one
of
the
pleasing
facts
of
our
conditions
that
people
who
are
socially
inferior
like
best
those
above
them
who
are
morally
anomalous
it
was
really
through
lyra
that
annie
got
at
the
working
people
and
when
it
came
to
a
formal
conference
there
was
no
one
who
could
command
their
confidence
like
putney
whom
they
saw
two
or
three
times
a
year
but
always
pulling
up
and
fighting
back
to
sanity
against
the
enemy
whose
power
some
of
them
had
felt
too
no
theory
is
so
perfect
as
not
to
be
subject
to
exceptions
in
the
experiment
and
in
spite
of
her
conviction
of
the
truth
of
social
philosophy
annie
is
aware
through
her
simple
and
frank
relations
with
the
hands
in
a
business
matter
of
mutual
kindness
which
it
does
not
account
for
but
perhaps
the
philosophy
and
the
experiment
were
not
contradictory
perhaps
it
was
intended
to
cover
only
the
cases
in
which
they
had
no
common
interest
at
anyrate
when
the
peck
social
union
as
its
members
voted
to
call
it
at
the
suggestion
of
one
of
their
own
number
got
in
working
order
she
was
as
cordially
welcomed
to
the
charge
of
its
funds
and
accounts
as
if
she
had
been
a
hand
or
a
she
is
really
of
use
for
its
working
is
by
no
means
ideal
and
with
her
wider
knowledge
she
has
suggested
improvements
and
expedients
for
making
both
ends
meet
which
were
sometimes
so
reluctant
to
meet
she
has
kept
a
conscience
against
subsidising
the
union
from
her
own
means
and
she
even
accepts
for
her
services
a
small
salary
which
its
members
think
they
ought
to
pay
her
she
owns
this
ridiculous
like
all
the
work
of
rich
people
a
travesty
which
has
no
reality
except
the
little
sum
it
added
to
the
greater
sum
of
her
superabundance
she
is
aware
that
she
is
a
pensioner
upon
the
real
members
of
the
social
union
for
a
chance
to
be
useful
and
that
the
work
they
let
her
do
is
the
right
of
some
one
who
needs
it
she
has
thought
of
doing
the
work
and
giving
the
pay
to
another
but
she
sees
that
this
would
be
pauperising
and
degrading
another
so
she
dwells
in
a
vicious
circle
and
waits
and
mostly
forgets
and
is
mostly
happy
the
social
union
itself
though
not
a
brilliant
success
in
all
points
is
still
not
a
failure
and
the
promise
of
its
future
is
in
the
fact
that
it
continues
to
have
a
present
the
people
of
hatboro
are
rather
proud
of
it
and
strangers
visit
it
as
one
of
the
possible
solutions
of
one
of
the
social
problems
it
is
predicted
that
it
can
not
go
on
that
it
must
either
do
better
or
do
worse
but
it
goes
on
the
same
putney
studies
its
existence
in
the
light
of
his
own
infirmity
to
which
he
still
yields
from
time
to
time
as
he
has
always
done
he
professes
to
find
there
a
law
which
would
account
for
a
great
many
facts
of
human
experience
otherwise
inexplicable
he
does
not
attempt
to
define
this
occult
preservative
principle
but
he
offers
himself
and
the
social
union
as
proofs
of
its
existence
and
he
argues
that
if
they
can
only
last
long
enough
they
will
finally
be
established
in
a
virtue
and
prosperity
as
great
as
those
of
gerrish
and
his
store
annie
sometimes
feels
that
nothing
else
can
explain
the
maintenance
of
lyra
wilmington
peculiar
domestic
relations
at
the
point
which
perpetually
invites
comment
and
never
justifies
scandal
the
situation
seems
to
her
as
lamentable
as
ever
she
grieves
over
lyra
and
likes
her
and
laughs
with
her
she
no
longer
detests
jack
wilmington
so
much
since
he
showed
himself
so
willing
and
helpful
about
the
social
union
she
thinks
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
good
in
him
and
sometimes
she
is
sorry
for
him
and
longs
to
speak
again
to
lyra
about
the
wrong
she
is
doing
him
one
of
the
dangers
of
having
a
very
definite
point
of
view
is
the
temptation
of
abusing
it
to
read
the
whole
riddle
of
the
painful
earth
annie
has
permitted
herself
to
think
of
lyra
position
as
one
which
would
be
impossible
in
a
state
of
things
where
there
was
neither
poverty
nor
riches
and
there
was
neither
luxury
on
one
hand
to
allure
nor
the
fear
of
want
to
constrain
on
the
other
when
her
recoil
from
the
fulfilment
of
her
volunteer
pledge
to
peck
brought
her
face
to
face
with
her
own
weakness
there
were
two
ways
back
to
either
of
which
she
might
take
she
might
revert
to
her
first
opinion
of
him
and
fortify
herself
in
that
contempt
and
rejection
of
his
ideas
or
she
might
abandon
herself
to
them
with
a
vague
intention
of
reparation
to
him
and
accept
them
to
the
last
insinuation
of
their
logic
this
was
what
she
did
and
while
her
life
remained
the
same
outwardly
it
was
inwardly
all
changed
she
never
could
tell
by
what
steps
she
reached
her
agreement
with
the
minister
philosophy
perhaps
as
a
woman
it
was
not
possible
she
should
but
she
had
a
faith
concerning
it
to
which
she
bore
unswerving
allegiance
and
it
was
putney
delight
to
witness
its
revolutionary
effect
on
an
old
hatboro
kilburn
the
daughter
of
a
shrewd
lawyer
and
canny
politician
like
her
father
and
the
heir
of
an
aristocratic
tradition
a
gentlewoman
born
and
bred
he
declared
himself
a
reactionary
in
comparison
with
her
and
had
the
habit
of
taking
the
conservative
side
against
her
she
was
in
the
joke
of
this
but
it
was
a
real
trouble
to
her
for
a
time
that
morrell
after
admitting
the
force
of
her
reasons
should
be
content
to
rest
in
a
comfortable
inconclusion
as
to
his
conduct
till
one
day
she
reflected
that
this
was
what
she
was
herself
doing
and
that
she
differed
from
him
only
in
the
openness
with
which
she
proclaimed
her
opinions
being
a
woman
her
opinions
were
treated
by
the
magnates
of
hatboro
as
a
good
joke
the
harmless
fantasies
of
an
old
maid
which
she
would
get
rid
of
if
she
could
get
anybody
to
marry
her
being
a
lady
and
very
well
off
they
were
received
with
deference
and
she
was
left
to
their
uninterrupted
enjoyment
putney
amused
himself
by
saying
that
she
was
the
fiercest
apostle
of
labour
that
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
but
no
one
cared
half
so
much
for
all
that
as
for
the
question
whether
her
affair
with
morrell
was
a
friendship
or
a
courtship
they
saw
an
activity
of
attention
on
his
part
which
would
justify
the
most
devout
belief
in
the
latter
and
yet
they
were
confronted
with
the
fact
that
it
so
long
remained
eventless
the
two
theories
one
that
she
was
amusing
herself
with
him
and
the
other
that
he
was
just
playing
with
her
divided
public
opinion
but
they
did
not
molest
either
of
the
parties
to
the
mystery
and
the
village
after
a
season
of
acute
conjecture
quiesced
into
that
sarcastic
sufferance
of
the
anomaly
into
which
it
may
have
been
noticed
that
small
communities
are
apt
to
subside
from
such
occasions
except
for
some
such
irreconcilable
as
gerrish
it
was
a
good
joke
that
if
you
could
not
find
morrell
in
his
office
after
tea
you
could
always
find
him
at
miss
kilburn
perhaps
it
might
have
helped
solve
the
mystery
if
it
had
been
known
that
she
could
not
accept
the
situation
whatever
it
really
was
without
satisfying
herself
upon
two
points
which
resolved
themselves
into
one
in
the
process
of
the
inquiry
she
asked
apparently
as
preliminary
to
answering
a
question
of
his
have
you
heard
that
gossip
about
my
being
in
caring
for
the
poor
man
and
did
you
what
did
you
think
that
it
was
true
i
knew
if
there
were
anything
in
it
you
have
talked
him
over
with
she
was
silent
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
no
there
could
have
been
but
not
for
that
reason
alone
though
it
very
delicate
and
generous
of
you
to
think
of
it
very
but
because
it
have
been
i
could
have
worshipped
him
but
i
could
have
loved
him
any
more
she
added
with
an
implication
that
entirely
satisfied
him
than
i
could
have
worshipped
the
end
