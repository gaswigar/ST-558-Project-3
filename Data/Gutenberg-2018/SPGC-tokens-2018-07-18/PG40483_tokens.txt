i
in
the
year
bleakridge
residential
suburb
of
bursley
was
still
most
plainly
divided
into
old
and
new
that
is
to
say
into
the
dull
red
or
dull
yellow
with
stone
facings
and
the
bright
red
with
terra
cotta
gimcrackery
like
incompatible
liquids
congealed
in
a
pot
the
two
components
had
run
into
each
other
and
mingled
but
never
mixed
paramount
among
the
old
was
the
house
of
the
member
of
parliament
near
the
top
of
the
important
mound
that
separates
hanbridge
from
bursley
the
aged
and
widowed
member
used
the
house
little
but
he
kept
it
up
and
sometimes
came
into
it
with
an
unexpectedness
that
extremely
flattered
the
suburb
thus
you
might
be
reading
in
the
morning
paper
that
the
member
had
given
a
lunch
in
london
on
the
previous
day
to
cabinet
ministers
and
ladies
as
splendid
as
the
countess
of
chell
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
you
might
see
the
member
himself
walking
down
trafalgar
road
sad
fragile
sedately
alert
with
his
hands
behind
him
or
waving
a
gracious
hand
to
an
acquaintance
whereupon
you
would
announce
not
apathetically
member
s
gone
down
to
macilvaine
s
macilvaine
s
being
the
works
in
which
the
member
had
an
interest
and
there
would
perhaps
be
a
rush
to
the
window
those
were
the
last
great
days
of
bleakridge
after
the
member
s
house
ranked
such
historic
residences
as
those
of
osmond
orgreave
the
architect
which
had
the
largest
greenest
garden
and
the
best
trees
in
bleakridge
and
fearns
the
hanbridge
lawyer
together
with
manor
cottage
though
a
spacious
house
where
lived
the
mechanical
genius
who
had
revolutionised
the
pottery
industry
and
strangely
enough
made
a
fortune
thereby
and
the
dark
abode
of
the
high
church
parson
next
in
importance
came
the
three
terraces
manor
terrace
abbey
terrace
and
the
sneyd
terrace
each
consisting
of
three
or
four
houses
and
all
on
the
west
side
of
trafalgar
road
with
long
and
a
distant
prospect
of
hillport
therefrom
over
the
manor
fields
the
terraces
considered
as
architecture
were
unbeautiful
inconvenient
perhaps
paltry
as
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
rents
ran
as
low
as
a
year
but
they
had
been
wondrous
in
their
day
the
pride
of
builders
and
owners
and
the
marvel
of
a
barbaric
populace
they
too
had
histories
which
many
people
knew
age
had
softened
them
and
sanctioned
their
dignity
a
gate
might
creak
but
the
harsh
curves
of
its
ironwork
had
been
mollified
by
time
moreover
the
property
was
always
maintained
in
excellent
repair
by
its
landlords
and
residents
cared
passionately
for
the
appearance
of
the
windows
and
the
the
plenary
respectability
of
the
residents
could
not
be
impugned
they
were
as
good
as
the
best
for
address
they
would
not
give
the
number
of
the
house
in
trafalgar
road
but
the
name
of
its
terrace
just
as
much
as
the
occupiers
of
detached
houses
they
had
sorted
themselves
out
from
the
horde
conservative
or
liberal
they
were
ever
murmuring
to
themselves
as
they
descended
the
in
the
morning
and
mounted
them
in
the
evening
most
folks
are
nobodies
but
i
am
somebody
and
this
was
true
the
still
smaller
old
houses
in
between
the
terraces
and
even
the
old
cottages
in
the
side
streets
which
all
ran
to
the
east
had
a
similar
distinction
of
caste
aloofness
and
tradition
the
least
of
them
was
scornful
of
the
crowd
and
deeply
conscious
of
itself
as
a
separate
individuality
when
the
of
a
cottage
in
manor
street
added
a
to
his
the
event
seemed
enormous
in
manor
street
and
affected
even
trafalgar
road
as
a
notorious
figure
in
the
streets
may
disconcert
a
whole
quarter
by
growing
a
beard
the
congeries
of
cottage
yards
between
manor
street
and
higginbotham
street
as
visible
from
certain
high
in
trafalgar
road
a
crowded
of
walls
and
chimneys
pavements
and
slate
roofs
well
illustrated
the
grand
victorian
epoch
of
the
building
society
when
eighteenpence
was
added
weekly
to
eighteenpence
and
land
haggled
over
by
the
foot
and
every
brick
counted
in
the
grim
long
effort
to
break
away
from
the
mass
the
traditionalism
of
bleakridge
protected
even
roman
catholicism
in
that
district
of
nonconformity
where
there
were
at
least
three
methodist
chapels
to
every
church
and
where
the
adjective
popish
was
commonly
used
in
preference
to
papal
the
little
catholic
chapel
and
the
priest
s
house
with
its
at
the
top
of
the
mound
were
as
respected
as
any
other
buildings
because
roman
catholicism
had
always
been
endemic
there
since
the
age
when
the
entire
let
belonged
to
cistercian
monks
in
white
robes
a
feebly
endemic
catholicism
and
a
complete
exemption
from
tithes
were
all
that
remained
of
the
cistercian
occupation
the
exemption
was
highly
esteemed
by
the
possessing
class
alderman
sutton
towards
the
end
of
the
seventies
first
pitted
the
new
against
the
old
in
bleakridge
the
lifelong
secretary
of
a
building
society
he
was
responsible
for
a
terrace
of
three
commodious
modern
residences
exactly
opposite
the
house
of
the
member
the
member
and
osmond
orgreave
might
modernise
their
antique
houses
as
much
as
they
liked
they
could
never
match
the
modernity
of
the
alderman
s
terrace
to
which
by
the
way
he
declined
to
give
a
name
he
was
capable
of
covering
his
walls
with
papers
at
a
roll
and
yet
he
capriciously
preferred
numbers
to
a
name
these
houses
cost
twelve
hundred
pounds
each
a
lot
of
money
in
the
happy
days
when
good
bricks
were
only
a
thousand
or
a
farthing
apiece
and
imposed
themselves
at
once
upon
the
respect
and
admiration
of
bleakridge
a
year
or
two
later
the
clayhanger
house
went
up
at
the
corner
of
trafalgar
road
and
hulton
street
and
easily
outvied
the
sutton
houses
geographically
at
the
centre
of
the
residential
suburb
it
represented
the
new
movement
in
bleakridge
at
its
apogee
and
indeed
was
never
beaten
by
later
ambitious
attempts
such
fine
erections
though
nearly
every
detail
of
them
challenged
tradition
could
not
disturb
bleakridge
s
belief
in
the
stability
of
society
but
simultaneously
whole
streets
of
cheap
small
houses
in
reality
pretentious
cottages
rose
round
about
hulton
street
was
all
new
and
cheap
oak
street
offered
a
row
of
pink
cottages
to
osmond
orgreave
s
garden
gates
and
there
were
three
other
similar
new
streets
between
oak
street
and
the
catholic
chapel
was
practised
in
trafalgar
road
itself
on
a
large
plot
in
full
view
of
the
catholic
chapel
where
a
speculative
builder
too
hurried
to
use
a
measure
stepped
out
the
foundations
of
fifteen
cottages
with
his
own
bandy
legs
and
when
the
corner
of
a
cottage
fell
into
the
street
remarked
that
accidents
would
happen
and
had
the
bricks
replaced
but
not
every
cottage
was
many
perhaps
most
were
of
fairly
honest
workmanship
all
were
modern
and
relatively
spacious
and
much
superior
in
plan
to
the
old
all
had
and
yet
all
their
together
could
not
produce
an
effect
equal
to
one
in
ancient
manor
street
because
they
had
omitted
to
be
individual
not
one
showy
dwelling
was
unlike
another
nor
desired
to
be
unlike
another
the
garish
new
streets
were
tenanted
by
magic
on
tuesday
the
paperhangers
might
be
whistling
in
those
called
parlours
in
manor
street
on
wednesday
were
curtained
and
chimneys
smoking
and
just
as
the
cottages
lacked
individuality
so
the
tenants
were
nobodies
at
any
rate
no
traditional
person
in
bleakridge
knew
who
they
were
nor
where
they
came
from
except
that
they
came
mysteriously
up
out
of
the
town
not
that
there
had
been
any
shocking
increase
in
the
birthrate
down
there
and
no
traditional
person
seemed
to
care
the
strange
inroad
and
portent
ought
to
have
puzzled
and
possibly
to
have
intimidated
traditional
bleakridge
but
it
did
not
bleakridge
merely
observed
that
a
lot
of
building
was
going
on
and
left
the
phenomenon
at
that
at
first
it
was
interested
and
flattered
then
somewhat
resentful
and
regretful
and
even
edwin
clayhanger
though
he
counted
himself
among
the
enlightened
and
the
truly
democratic
felt
hurt
when
quite
nice
houses
copying
some
features
of
his
own
on
a
small
scale
and
let
to
such
people
as
insurance
agents
began
to
fill
up
the
remaining
empty
spaces
of
trafalgar
road
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
prestige
of
bleakridge
was
being
impaired
ii
edwin
clayhanger
though
very
young
in
marriage
considered
that
he
was
getting
on
in
years
as
a
householder
his
age
was
he
had
been
married
only
a
few
months
under
peculiar
circumstances
which
rendered
him
and
on
an
evening
of
august
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
of
his
house
awaiting
the
commencement
of
a
postponed
and
unusual
at
home
he
felt
absurdly
nervous
but
the
nervousness
was
not
painful
because
he
himself
could
laugh
at
it
he
might
be
timid
he
might
be
a
little
gawky
he
might
often
have
the
curious
sensation
of
not
being
really
adult
but
only
a
boy
after
all
the
great
impressive
facts
would
always
emerge
that
he
was
the
respected
head
of
a
family
that
he
was
successful
that
he
had
both
ideas
and
money
and
that
his
position
as
one
of
the
two
chief
of
the
district
would
not
be
challenged
he
knew
that
he
could
afford
to
be
nervous
and
further
since
he
was
he
had
merely
to
glance
round
his
house
in
order
to
be
reassured
and
puffed
up
loitering
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
discreetly
stylish
in
an
almost
new
blue
serge
suit
and
a
quite
new
black
satin
tie
with
the
light
of
the
gas
on
one
side
of
his
face
and
the
twilight
through
the
glazed
mitigating
the
shadow
on
the
other
edwin
mused
pleasingly
upon
the
whole
organism
of
his
home
externally
the
woodwork
and
metalwork
of
the
house
had
just
been
repainted
and
the
brickwork
pointed
he
took
pleasure
in
the
thought
of
the
long
even
lines
of
fresh
mortar
and
of
the
new
spoutings
and
pipings
every
foot
of
which
he
knew
by
heart
and
where
every
tube
began
and
where
it
ended
and
what
its
purpose
was
the
nice
fitting
of
a
perpendicular
spout
into
a
horizontal
one
and
the
curve
of
the
joint
from
the
eave
to
the
wall
of
the
house
and
the
elaborate
staples
that
firmly
held
the
spout
to
the
wall
and
the
final
curve
of
the
spout
that
brought
its
orifice
accurately
over
a
spotless
grid
in
the
ground
the
perfection
of
all
these
ridiculous
details
each
beneath
the
notice
of
a
truly
celestial
mind
would
put
the
householder
edwin
into
a
sort
of
contemplative
ecstasy
perhaps
he
was
comical
but
such
inner
experiences
were
part
of
his
great
interest
in
life
part
of
his
large
general
passion
within
the
hall
he
regarded
with
equal
interest
and
pride
the
photogravure
of
bellini
s
agony
in
the
garden
from
the
national
gallery
and
the
radiator
which
he
had
just
had
installed
the
radiator
was
only
a
but
it
was
his
precious
toy
his
pet
lamb
his
mistress
and
the
theory
of
it
was
that
by
warming
the
hall
and
the
well
of
the
staircase
it
softly
influenced
the
whole
house
and
abolished
draughts
he
had
exaggerated
the
chilliness
of
the
late
august
night
so
that
he
might
put
the
radiator
into
action
about
the
small
furnace
in
the
cellar
that
heated
it
he
was
both
crotchetty
and
extravagant
the
costly
efficiency
of
the
radiator
somewhat
atoned
in
his
mind
for
the
imperfections
of
the
hot
water
apparatus
depending
on
the
kitchen
boiler
even
in
this
pioneer
and
sensualist
was
dreaming
of
an
ideal
house
in
which
inexhaustible
water
was
always
positively
steaming
so
that
if
a
succession
of
persons
should
capriciously
desire
hot
baths
in
the
cold
middle
of
the
night
their
collective
fancy
might
be
satisfied
bellini
s
picture
was
the
symbol
of
an
artistic
revolution
in
edwin
he
had
read
somewhere
that
it
was
perhaps
the
greatest
picture
in
the
world
a
critic
s
exhortation
to
observe
the
loving
realistic
passion
shown
in
the
foreshortening
of
the
figure
of
the
sleeping
apostle
had
remained
in
his
mind
and
thrilled
he
would
point
out
this
feature
of
the
picture
alike
to
the
comprehending
and
the
uncomprehending
the
of
the
bellini
in
its
strange
frame
of
stained
unpolished
oak
had
been
an
epochal
event
closing
one
era
and
inaugurating
another
and
yet
before
the
event
he
had
not
even
noticed
the
picture
on
a
visit
to
the
national
gallery
a
hint
a
phrase
murmured
in
the
right
tone
in
a
periodical
a
glimpse
of
an
illustration
and
the
mighty
magic
seed
was
sown
in
a
few
months
all
victorian
phenomena
had
been
put
upon
their
trial
and
most
of
them
condemned
and
condemned
without
even
the
forms
of
justice
half
a
word
in
the
right
tone
might
ruin
any
of
them
thus
was
sir
frederick
leighton
himself
overthrown
one
day
his
bath
of
psyche
reigned
in
edwin
s
bedroom
and
the
next
it
had
gone
and
none
knew
why
but
certain
aged
victorians
such
as
edwin
s
auntie
hamps
took
the
disappearance
of
the
licentious
engraving
as
a
sign
that
the
beloved
queer
edwin
was
at
last
coming
to
his
senses
as
of
course
they
knew
he
ultimately
would
he
did
not
and
could
not
explain
more
and
more
he
was
growing
to
look
upon
his
house
as
an
island
cut
off
by
a
difference
of
manners
from
the
varnished
barbarism
of
multitudinous
new
cottages
and
by
an
immensely
more
profound
difference
of
thought
from
both
the
cottages
and
the
larger
houses
it
seemed
astounding
to
edwin
that
modes
of
thought
so
violently
separative
as
his
and
theirs
could
exist
so
close
together
and
under
such
appearances
of
similarity
not
even
all
the
younger
members
of
the
orgreave
family
who
counted
as
his
nearest
friends
were
esteemed
by
edwin
to
be
meet
for
his
complete
candour
the
unique
island
was
scarcely
a
dozen
years
old
but
historical
occurrences
had
aged
it
for
edwin
he
had
opened
the
doors
of
all
three
partly
to
extend
the
benign
sway
of
the
radiator
and
partly
so
that
he
might
judge
the
total
effect
of
the
illuminated
chambers
and
improve
that
effect
if
possible
and
each
room
bore
the
mysterious
imprints
of
past
emotion
in
the
with
its
new
that
gilded
everything
beneath
them
edwin
s
father
used
to
sit
on
sunday
evenings
alone
and
one
sunday
evening
when
edwin
entering
had
first
mentioned
to
his
father
a
woman
s
name
his
father
had
most
terribly
humiliated
him
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
some
other
youth
and
not
edwin
had
been
humiliated
so
completely
was
the
wound
healed
and
he
could
remember
leaning
in
the
doorway
of
the
one
sunday
morning
and
his
sister
clara
was
seated
at
the
piano
and
his
sister
maggie
nursing
a
baby
of
clara
s
by
her
side
and
they
were
singing
balfe
s
duet
excelsior
and
his
father
stood
behind
them
crying
crying
steadily
until
at
length
the
bitter
old
man
lost
control
of
himself
and
sobbed
aloud
under
the
emotional
stress
of
the
women
s
voices
and
clara
cheerfully
upbraided
him
for
foolishness
and
edwin
had
walked
suddenly
away
this
memory
was
somehow
far
more
poignant
than
the
memory
of
his
humiliation
and
in
the
too
he
had
finally
betrothed
himself
to
hilda
that
by
comparison
was
only
yesterday
yet
it
was
historical
and
distant
he
was
wearing
his
being
convalescent
from
influenza
he
could
distinctly
recall
the
feel
of
his
and
hilda
came
in
over
her
face
was
a
veil
the
whose
large
glistening
table
was
now
covered
with
the
most
varied
and
modern
refreshments
for
the
at
home
had
witnessed
no
event
specially
dramatic
but
it
had
witnessed
hundreds
of
monotonous
tragic
meals
at
which
the
progress
of
his
father
s
mental
malady
and
the
approach
of
his
death
could
be
measured
by
the
old
man
s
increasing
disability
to
distinguish
between
his
knife
and
his
fork
it
had
seen
darius
clayhanger
fed
like
a
baby
and
it
had
never
been
the
same
since
edwin
might
transform
it
it
it
the
mysterious
imprint
remained
and
then
there
was
the
little
inserted
into
the
plan
of
the
house
between
the
hall
and
the
kitchen
nothing
had
happened
there
because
the
life
of
the
household
had
never
adjusted
itself
to
the
new
borrowed
convention
of
the
nothing
but
the
most
sensational
thing
had
happened
there
when
with
an
exquisite
passing
timidity
she
took
possession
of
edwin
s
house
as
his
wife
hilda
had
had
a
sudden
gust
of
audacity
in
the
a
mature
woman
with
a
boy
aged
ten
to
prove
it
she
had
effervesced
into
the
naïve
gestures
of
a
young
girl
who
has
inherited
a
boudoir
this
shall
be
my
very
own
room
and
i
shall
arrange
it
just
how
i
like
without
asking
you
about
and
it
will
be
my
very
own
she
had
not
offered
an
idea
she
had
announced
a
decision
edwin
had
had
other
notions
for
the
room
but
he
perceived
that
he
must
bury
them
in
eternal
silence
and
yield
eagerly
to
this
caprice
thus
to
acquiesce
had
given
him
deep
and
strange
joy
he
was
startled
perhaps
to
discover
that
he
had
brought
into
his
house
not
a
woman
but
a
tripartite
creature
woman
child
and
sibyl
neither
maggie
nor
clara
nor
janet
orgreave
nor
even
hilda
before
she
became
his
wife
had
ever
aroused
in
him
the
least
suspicion
that
a
woman
might
be
a
tripartite
creature
he
was
married
certainly
nobody
could
be
more
legally
and
respectably
married
than
was
he
but
the
mere
marriage
seemed
naught
in
comparison
with
the
enormous
fact
that
he
had
got
this
unexampled
creature
in
his
house
and
was
living
with
her
she
at
his
mercy
and
he
at
hers
enchanting
escapade
solemn
doom
by
the
way
she
had
yet
done
nothing
with
the
yes
she
had
stolen
a
cabinet
gold
frame
from
the
shop
and
put
his
photograph
into
it
and
stuck
his
picture
on
the
mantelpiece
but
that
was
all
she
would
not
permit
him
to
worry
her
about
her
secret
designs
for
the
the
was
her
affair
indeed
the
whole
house
was
her
affair
it
was
no
longer
his
house
in
which
he
could
issue
orders
without
considering
another
individuality
orders
that
would
infallibly
be
executed
either
cheerfully
or
glumly
by
the
plump
spinster
maggie
he
had
to
mind
his
p
s
and
q
s
he
had
to
be
wary
everywhere
the
creature
did
not
simply
live
in
the
house
she
pervaded
it
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
he
felt
her
iii
she
was
now
upstairs
in
their
joint
bedroom
dressing
for
the
at
home
all
day
he
had
feared
she
might
be
late
and
as
he
looked
at
the
he
saw
that
the
risk
was
getting
acute
before
the
domestic
rearrangements
preceding
the
marriage
had
been
fully
discussed
he
had
assumed
and
maggie
and
clara
had
assumed
and
auntie
hamps
had
absolutely
assumed
that
the
husband
and
wife
would
occupy
the
long
empty
bedroom
of
old
darius
because
it
was
broader
than
edwin
s
and
because
it
was
the
principal
bedroom
but
hilda
had
said
no
to
him
privately
whereupon
being
himself
almost
morbidly
unsentimental
he
had
judiciously
hinted
that
to
object
to
a
room
because
an
old
man
had
died
in
it
under
distressing
circumstances
was
to
be
morbidly
sentimental
and
unworthy
of
her
whereupon
she
had
mysteriously
smiled
and
called
him
sweet
bad
names
and
kissed
him
and
hung
on
his
neck
sentimental
could
not
the
great
stupid
see
without
being
told
that
what
influenced
her
was
not
an
aversion
for
his
father
s
bedroom
but
a
predilection
for
edwin
s
she
desired
that
they
should
inhabit
his
room
she
wanted
to
sleep
in
his
room
and
to
wake
up
in
it
and
to
feel
that
she
was
immersing
herself
in
his
past
ah
the
exciting
flattery
like
an
aphrodisiac
and
she
would
not
allow
him
to
uproot
the
fixed
bookcases
on
either
side
of
the
hearth
she
said
that
for
her
they
were
part
of
the
room
itself
useless
to
argue
that
they
occupied
space
required
for
extra
furniture
she
would
manage
she
did
manage
he
found
that
the
acme
of
convenience
for
a
husband
had
not
been
achieved
but
convenience
was
naught
in
the
rapture
of
the
escapade
he
had
needed
shaking
up
as
they
say
down
there
and
he
was
shaken
up
nevertheless
though
undoubtedly
shaken
up
he
had
the
male
wit
to
perceive
that
the
bedroom
episode
had
been
a
peculiar
triumph
for
himself
her
attitude
in
it
imperious
superficially
was
in
truth
an
impassioned
and
outright
surrender
to
him
and
further
she
had
at
once
become
a
frankly
admiring
partisan
of
his
theory
of
bedrooms
the
need
for
a
comfortable
solitude
earlier
in
life
had
led
edwin
to
make
his
bedroom
habitable
by
means
of
a
an
easy
chair
and
minor
amenities
when
teased
by
hardy
compatriots
about
his
sybaritism
edwin
was
apt
sometimes
to
flush
and
be
nettled
and
he
would
make
offensive
comments
upon
the
average
bedroom
of
the
average
english
household
which
was
so
barbaric
that
during
eight
months
of
the
year
you
could
not
maintain
your
temperature
in
it
unless
you
were
either
in
bed
or
running
about
the
room
and
that
even
in
summer
you
could
not
sit
down
therein
at
ease
because
there
was
nothing
easy
to
sit
on
nor
a
table
to
sit
at
nor
even
a
book
to
read
he
would
caustically
ask
to
be
informed
why
the
supposedly
practical
and
english
were
content
with
an
alpine
hut
for
a
bedroom
and
in
this
way
he
would
go
on
he
was
rather
pleased
with
the
phrase
alpine
hut
one
day
he
had
overheard
hilda
replying
to
an
acquaintance
upstairs
people
may
say
what
they
like
but
edwin
and
i
don
t
care
to
sleep
in
an
alpine
hut
she
had
caught
it
she
was
his
disciple
in
that
matter
and
how
she
had
appreciated
his
as
for
calm
deliberation
in
dressing
and
undressing
she
could
astonishingly
and
even
disconcertingly
surpass
him
in
the
quality
but
it
is
to
be
noted
that
she
would
not
permit
her
son
to
have
a
in
his
bedroom
nor
would
she
let
him
occupy
the
disdained
principal
bedroom
her
argument
being
that
that
room
was
too
large
for
a
little
boy
maggie
clayhanger
s
old
bedroom
was
given
to
george
and
the
principal
bedroom
remained
empty
chapter
ii
hilda
on
the
stairs
i
ada
descended
the
stairs
young
slim
very
neat
ada
was
one
of
hilda
s
two
new
servants
before
taking
charge
of
the
house
hilda
had
ordained
the
operation
called
a
clean
sweep
and
edwin
had
approved
the
elder
of
maggie
s
two
servants
had
been
a
good
one
but
hilda
had
shown
no
interest
in
the
catalogue
of
her
excellences
she
wanted
fresh
servants
maggie
like
edwin
approved
but
only
as
a
general
principle
in
the
particular
case
she
had
hinted
that
her
prospective
was
perhaps
unwise
to
let
slip
a
tested
servant
hilda
wanted
not
merely
fresh
servants
but
young
servants
agreeable
to
behold
i
will
not
have
a
lot
of
scowling
women
about
my
house
hilda
had
said
maggie
was
reserved
but
her
glance
was
meant
to
remind
hilda
that
in
those
days
mistresses
had
to
be
content
with
what
they
could
get
young
and
comely
servants
were
all
very
well
if
you
could
drop
on
them
but
supposing
you
couldn
t
the
fact
was
that
maggie
could
not
understand
hilda
s
insistence
on
youth
and
comeliness
in
a
servant
and
she
foresaw
trouble
for
hilda
hilda
however
obtained
her
desire
she
was
outspoken
with
her
servants
if
edwin
after
his
manner
implied
that
she
was
dangerously
ignoring
the
touchiness
of
the
modern
servant
she
would
say
indifferently
it
s
always
open
to
them
to
go
if
they
don
t
like
it
they
did
not
go
it
is
notorious
that
foolhardy
mistresses
are
often
very
lucky
as
soon
as
ada
caught
sight
of
her
master
in
the
hall
she
became
all
the
joints
of
her
body
seemed
to
be
hung
on
very
resilient
springs
and
reddening
slightly
she
lowered
her
gaze
and
looked
at
her
tripping
toes
edwin
seldom
spoke
to
her
more
than
once
a
day
and
not
always
that
he
had
one
day
visited
the
large
attic
into
which
with
her
colleague
she
disappeared
late
at
night
and
from
which
she
emerged
early
in
the
morning
and
he
had
seen
two
small
tin
trunks
and
some
clothes
behind
the
door
and
an
and
a
portrait
of
a
fireman
on
the
mantelpiece
the
fireman
he
seemed
to
recollect
was
her
brother
but
she
was
a
stranger
in
his
house
and
he
had
no
sustained
curiosity
about
her
the
days
were
gone
when
he
used
to
be
the
intimate
of
servants
of
nixon
for
example
sole
prop
of
the
clayhanger
family
for
many
years
and
an
entirely
human
being
to
edwin
nixon
had
never
been
either
young
slim
or
neat
she
was
dead
the
last
servant
whom
he
could
be
said
to
have
known
was
a
pert
niece
of
nixon
s
now
somebody
s
prolific
wife
and
much
changed
and
he
was
now
somebody
s
husband
and
bearded
and
perhaps
occasionally
pompous
and
much
changed
in
other
ways
so
that
enigmatic
adas
bridled
at
sight
of
him
and
became
intensely
aware
of
themselves
still
this
ada
in
her
smartness
was
a
pretty
sight
for
his
eyes
as
like
an
aspen
she
trembled
down
the
stairs
though
the
coarseness
of
her
big
red
hands
and
the
vulgarity
of
her
accent
were
a
surprising
contrast
to
her
waist
and
her
fine
carriage
he
knew
she
had
been
hooking
her
mistress
s
dress
and
that
therefore
the
hooking
must
be
finished
he
liked
to
think
of
hilda
being
attired
thus
in
the
bedroom
by
a
natty
deferential
wench
the
process
gave
to
hilda
a
luxurious
even
an
oriental
quality
which
charmed
him
he
liked
the
suddenly
impressive
tone
in
which
the
haughty
hilda
would
say
to
ada
your
master
as
if
mentioning
a
sultan
he
was
more
and
more
anxious
lest
hilda
should
be
late
and
he
wanted
to
ask
ada
is
clayhanger
coming
down
but
he
discreetly
forbore
he
might
have
run
up
to
the
bedroom
and
burst
in
on
the
toilette
hilda
would
have
welcomed
him
but
he
preferred
to
remain
with
his
anxiety
where
he
was
and
meditate
upon
hilda
bedecking
herself
up
there
in
the
bedroom
to
please
him
to
please
not
the
guests
but
him
ada
disappeared
down
the
narrow
passage
leading
to
the
kitchen
and
a
moment
later
he
heard
a
crude
giggle
almost
a
scream
and
some
echo
of
the
rough
tones
in
which
the
servants
spoke
to
each
other
when
they
were
alone
in
the
kitchen
there
were
in
fact
two
adas
one
was
as
timid
as
a
fawn
with
a
voice
like
a
delicate
invalid
s
the
other
a
girl
such
as
rushed
out
of
potbanks
in
flannel
apron
at
one
o
clock
the
clayhanger
servants
were
satisfactory
more
than
satisfactory
the
subject
of
favourable
comment
for
their
neatness
among
the
mistresses
of
other
servants
he
liked
them
to
be
about
their
presence
and
their
official
demeanour
flattered
him
they
perfected
the
complex
superiority
of
his
house
that
island
but
when
he
overheard
them
alone
together
or
when
he
set
himself
to
imagine
what
their
soul
s
life
was
he
was
more
than
ever
amazed
at
the
unnoticed
profound
differences
between
modes
of
thought
that
in
apparently
the
most
natural
manner
could
exist
so
close
together
without
producing
a
cataclysm
auntie
hamps
s
theory
was
that
they
were
all
he
she
the
servants
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
ii
hilda
s
son
george
edwin
sidled
surprisingly
into
the
hall
he
was
wearing
a
sailor
suit
very
new
and
he
had
probably
been
invisible
somewhere
against
the
blue
curtains
of
the
window
an
example
of
nature
s
protective
mimicry
george
was
rather
small
for
his
ten
years
dark
like
his
mother
he
had
her
eyes
and
her
thick
eyebrows
that
almost
met
in
the
middle
and
her
pale
skin
as
for
his
mind
he
seemed
to
be
sometimes
alarmingly
precocious
and
sometimes
a
case
of
arrested
development
in
this
and
many
other
respects
he
greatly
resembled
other
boys
the
son
of
a
bigamist
can
have
no
name
unless
it
be
his
mother
s
maiden
name
but
george
knew
nothing
of
that
he
had
borne
his
father
s
name
and
when
at
the
exciting
and
puzzling
period
of
his
mother
s
marriage
he
had
learnt
that
his
surname
would
in
future
be
clayhanger
he
had
a
little
resented
the
affront
to
his
egoism
edwin
s
explanation
however
that
the
change
was
for
the
convenience
of
people
in
general
had
caused
him
to
shrug
his
shoulders
in
concession
and
to
murmur
casually
oh
well
then
he
seemed
to
be
assenting
with
loftiness
if
it
s
any
particular
use
to
the
whole
world
i
don
t
really
mind
i
say
uncle
he
began
edwin
had
chosen
this
form
of
address
stepfather
was
preposterous
and
father
somehow
offended
him
so
he
constituted
himself
an
uncle
hello
kid
said
he
can
you
find
room
to
keep
anything
else
in
your
pockets
besides
your
hands
george
snatched
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
then
he
smiled
confidently
up
these
two
were
friends
edwin
was
as
proud
as
the
boy
of
the
friendship
and
perhaps
more
flattered
at
first
he
had
not
cared
for
george
being
repelled
by
george
s
loud
positive
tones
his
brusque
and
often
violent
gestures
and
his
intense
absorption
in
himself
but
gradually
he
had
been
won
by
the
boy
s
boyishness
his
smile
his
little
soft
body
his
unspoken
invocations
his
resentment
of
injustice
except
when
strict
justice
appeared
to
clash
with
his
own
interests
his
absolute
impotence
against
adult
decrees
his
touching
fatalism
his
recondite
personal
distinction
that
flashed
and
was
gone
and
his
occasional
cleverness
and
wit
he
admitted
that
george
charmed
him
but
he
well
knew
that
he
also
charmed
george
he
had
a
way
of
treating
george
as
an
equal
that
few
children
save
possibly
clara
s
could
have
resisted
true
he
would
quiz
the
child
but
he
did
not
forbid
the
child
to
quiz
the
mother
was
profoundly
relieved
and
rejoiced
by
this
friendship
she
luxuriated
in
it
edwin
might
well
have
been
inimical
to
the
child
he
might
through
the
child
have
shown
a
jealousy
of
the
child
s
father
but
somewhat
to
the
astonishment
of
even
edwin
himself
he
never
saw
the
father
in
the
child
nor
thought
of
the
father
nor
resented
the
parenthood
that
was
not
his
for
him
the
child
was
an
individual
and
in
spite
of
his
stern
determination
not
to
fall
into
the
delusions
of
conceited
parents
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
george
was
a
remarkable
child
have
you
seen
my
horse
asked
george
have
i
seen
your
horse
oh
i
ve
seen
that
you
ve
left
it
lying
about
on
the
i
put
it
there
so
that
you
d
see
it
george
persuasively
excused
himself
for
the
untidiness
well
let
s
inspect
it
edwin
forgave
him
and
picked
up
from
the
table
a
piece
of
on
which
was
a
drawing
of
a
great
with
shaggy
feet
it
was
a
vivacious
sketch
you
re
improving
said
edwin
judicially
but
in
fact
much
impressed
surely
few
boys
of
ten
could
draw
as
well
as
that
the
design
was
strangely
more
mature
than
certain
quite
infantile
watercolours
that
edwin
had
seen
scarcely
a
year
earlier
it
s
rather
good
isn
t
it
george
suggested
lifting
up
his
head
so
that
he
could
just
see
over
the
edge
of
the
paper
which
edwin
held
at
the
level
of
his
i
ve
met
worse
where
did
you
see
this
particular
animal
i
saw
him
down
near
the
brewery
this
morning
but
when
i
m
doing
a
horse
i
see
him
on
the
paper
before
i
begin
to
draw
and
i
just
draw
round
him
edwin
thought
this
kid
is
no
ordinary
kid
he
said
well
we
ll
pin
it
up
here
we
ll
have
a
royal
academy
and
hear
what
the
public
has
to
say
he
took
a
pin
from
under
his
waistcoat
that
s
not
level
said
george
and
when
edwin
had
readjusted
the
pin
george
persisted
boldly
that
s
not
level
either
it
s
as
level
as
it
s
going
to
be
i
expect
you
ve
been
drawing
horses
instead
of
practising
your
piano
he
looked
down
at
the
mysterious
little
boy
who
lived
always
so
much
nearer
to
the
earth
s
surface
than
himself
george
nodded
simply
and
then
scratched
his
head
i
suppose
if
i
don
t
practise
while
i
m
young
i
shall
regret
it
in
after
life
shan
t
i
who
told
you
that
it
s
what
auntie
hamps
said
to
me
i
think
i
say
uncle
what
s
up
is
john
coming
i
suppose
so
why
oh
nothing
i
say
uncle
that
s
twice
you
ve
said
it
the
boy
smiled
you
know
that
piece
in
the
bible
about
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
what
of
it
edwin
asked
rather
curtly
anticipating
difficulties
i
don
t
think
two
would
be
enough
would
they
two
might
but
i
m
not
so
sure
about
two
boys
you
see
in
the
very
next
verse
it
says
two
gathered
together
three
might
be
more
effective
it
s
always
as
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
could
you
pray
for
anything
a
penknife
for
instance
why
not
but
could
you
george
was
a
little
impatient
better
ask
your
mother
said
edwin
who
was
becoming
under
the
strain
george
exploded
coarsely
poh
it
s
no
good
asking
mother
said
edwin
the
great
thing
in
these
affairs
is
to
know
what
you
want
and
to
it
concentrate
as
hard
as
you
can
a
long
time
in
advance
no
use
half
wanting
well
there
s
one
thing
that
s
poz
positive
i
couldn
t
begin
to
concentrate
why
not
who
could
george
protested
we
re
all
so
nervous
aren
t
we
with
this
at
home
business
and
i
know
i
never
could
concentrate
in
my
best
clothes
for
edwin
the
boy
with
his
shocking
candour
had
suddenly
precipitated
out
of
the
atmosphere
as
it
were
the
collective
nervousness
of
the
household
made
it
into
a
phenomenon
visible
tangible
oppressive
and
the
household
was
no
longer
a
collection
of
units
but
an
entity
a
bell
rang
faintly
in
the
kitchen
and
the
sound
abraded
his
nerves
the
first
guests
were
on
the
threshold
and
hilda
was
late
he
looked
at
the
clock
yes
she
was
late
the
hour
named
in
the
invitations
was
already
past
all
day
he
had
feared
lest
she
should
be
late
and
she
was
late
he
looked
at
the
glass
of
the
but
night
had
come
and
it
was
opaque
ada
tripped
into
view
and
ran
upstairs
don
t
you
hear
the
he
stopped
her
flight
it
was
missis
s
bell
sir
ah
respite
ada
disappeared
then
another
ring
and
no
to
answer
the
bell
naturally
naturally
hilda
forgetting
something
at
the
last
moment
had
taken
the
away
precisely
when
the
girl
was
needed
oh
he
had
foreseen
it
he
could
hear
shuffling
outside
and
could
even
distinguish
forms
through
the
glass
many
forms
all
the
people
converging
from
various
streets
upon
the
waiting
nervousness
of
the
household
seemed
to
have
arrived
at
once
george
moved
impulsively
towards
the
where
are
you
going
edwin
asked
roughly
come
here
it
s
not
your
place
to
open
the
door
come
with
me
in
the
it
was
no
affair
of
edwin
s
thought
edwin
crossly
and
uncompromisingly
if
guests
were
kept
waiting
at
the
it
was
hilda
s
affair
she
was
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
the
blame
was
hers
at
high
speed
ada
swept
with
streamers
down
the
stairs
like
a
squirrel
down
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
then
came
hilda
iii
she
stood
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
waiting
while
the
was
opened
he
and
george
could
see
her
over
and
through
the
banisters
and
at
sight
of
her
triumphant
and
happy
air
all
edwin
s
annoyance
melted
he
did
not
desire
that
it
should
melt
but
it
melted
she
was
late
he
could
not
rely
on
her
not
to
be
late
in
summoning
the
parlourmaid
to
her
bedroom
when
the
parlourmaid
ought
to
have
been
on
duty
downstairs
she
had
acted
indefensibly
and
without
thought
no
harm
as
it
happened
was
done
sheer
chance
often
thus
saved
her
but
logically
her
double
fault
was
not
thereby
mitigated
he
felt
that
if
he
forgave
her
if
he
dismissed
the
charge
and
wiped
the
slate
he
was
being
false
to
the
great
male
principles
of
logic
and
justice
the
godlike
judge
in
him
resented
the
miscarriage
of
justice
nevertheless
justice
miscarried
and
the
weak
husband
said
like
a
woman
what
does
it
matter
such
was
her
shameful
power
over
him
of
which
the
unscrupulous
creature
was
quite
aware
as
he
looked
at
her
he
asked
himself
is
she
magnificent
or
is
she
just
ordinary
and
am
i
deluded
does
she
seem
her
age
is
she
a
mature
woman
getting
past
the
prime
or
has
she
miraculously
kept
herself
a
young
girl
for
me
in
years
she
was
she
had
large
bones
and
her
robust
body
neither
plump
nor
slim
showed
the
firm
assured
carriage
of
its
age
it
said
i
have
stood
before
the
world
and
i
can
not
be
intimidated
still
marriage
had
rejuvenated
her
she
was
marvellously
young
at
times
and
experience
would
drop
from
her
and
leave
the
girl
that
he
had
first
known
and
kissed
ten
years
earlier
but
a
less
harsh
less
uncompromising
girl
at
their
first
acquaintance
she
had
repelled
him
with
her
truculent
seriousness
nowadays
she
would
laugh
for
no
apparent
reason
and
even
pirouette
her
complexion
was
good
he
could
nearly
persuade
himself
that
that
olive
skin
had
not
suffered
in
a
decade
of
distress
and
disasters
previous
to
her
marriage
she
had
shown
little
interest
in
dress
but
now
she
would
spasmodically
worry
about
her
clothes
and
she
would
make
edwin
worry
he
had
to
decide
though
he
had
no
qualifications
as
an
arbiter
she
would
scowl
at
a
dressmaker
as
if
to
say
for
god
s
sake
do
realise
that
upon
you
is
laid
the
sacred
responsibility
of
helping
me
to
please
my
husband
she
was
wearing
a
striped
blue
dress
imperceptibly
décolletée
with
the
sleeves
of
the
period
the
colours
two
shades
of
blue
did
not
suit
her
but
she
imagined
that
they
suited
her
and
so
did
he
and
the
frock
was
elaborate
was
the
result
of
terrific
labour
and
produced
a
rich
effect
meet
for
a
hostess
of
position
the
mere
fact
that
this
woman
with
no
talent
for
coquetry
should
after
years
of
narrow
insufficiency
scowl
at
dressmakers
and
pout
at
senseless
refractory
silks
in
the
yearning
for
elegance
was
utterly
delicious
to
edwin
her
presence
there
on
the
landing
of
the
stairs
was
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
he
had
wanted
her
and
he
had
got
her
in
the
end
he
had
got
her
and
nothing
had
been
able
to
stop
him
not
even
the
obstacle
of
her
tragic
adventure
with
a
rascal
and
a
bigamist
the
strong
magic
of
his
passion
had
forced
destiny
to
render
her
up
to
him
mysteriously
intact
after
all
the
impossible
had
occurred
and
society
had
accepted
it
beaten
there
she
was
dramatically
with
her
thick
eyebrows
and
the
fine
wide
nostrils
and
the
delicate
lobe
of
the
ear
and
that
mouth
that
would
startlingly
fasten
on
him
and
kiss
the
life
out
of
him
there
is
dear
hilda
said
someone
at
the
door
amid
the
arriving
group
none
but
auntie
hamps
would
have
said
dear
hilda
maggie
clara
and
even
janet
orgreave
never
used
sentimental
adjectives
on
occasions
of
ceremony
and
in
her
clear
precise
dominating
voice
hilda
with
gay
ease
greeted
the
company
from
above
good
evening
all
what
the
deuce
was
i
so
upset
about
just
now
thought
edwin
in
sudden
instinctive
exulting
felicity
everything
is
absolutely
all
right
chapter
iii
attack
and
repulse
i
the
entering
guests
were
edwin
s
younger
sister
clara
with
her
husband
albert
benbow
his
elder
sister
maggie
auntie
hamps
and
peartree
they
had
arrived
together
and
rather
unfashionably
soon
after
the
hour
named
in
the
invitation
because
the
benbows
had
called
at
auntie
hamps
s
on
the
way
up
and
the
benbows
were
always
early
both
in
arriving
and
in
departing
on
account
of
the
children
they
called
themselves
early
birds
whenever
they
were
out
of
the
nest
in
the
evening
they
called
themselves
early
birds
they
used
the
comparison
hundreds
thousands
of
times
and
never
tired
of
it
indeed
each
time
they
were
convinced
that
they
had
invented
it
freshly
for
the
occasion
said
auntie
hamps
magnificent
in
jetty
black
handsome
and
above
all
imposing
i
knew
you
would
be
delighted
to
meet
peartree
again
edwin
he
is
staying
the
night
at
my
house
i
can
be
so
much
more
hospitable
now
maggie
is
with
me
and
i
insisted
he
should
come
up
with
us
but
it
needed
no
insisting
the
old
erect
lady
looked
from
peartree
with
pride
towards
her
nephew
peartree
was
a
man
of
fifty
with
greying
sandy
hair
twenty
years
before
he
had
been
second
minister
in
the
bursley
circuit
of
the
wesleyan
methodist
connexion
he
was
now
superintendent
minister
in
a
cheshire
circuit
the
unchangeable
canons
of
wesleyanism
permit
its
ministers
to
marry
and
celibacy
is
even
discouraged
for
the
reason
that
wives
and
daughters
are
expected
to
toil
in
the
cause
and
their
labour
costs
the
circuit
not
a
halfpenny
but
the
canons
forbid
ministers
to
take
root
and
found
a
home
eleven
times
in
thirty
years
peartree
had
been
forced
to
migrate
to
a
strange
circuit
and
to
adapt
his
furniture
and
family
to
a
house
which
he
had
not
chosen
and
which
his
wife
generally
did
not
like
during
part
of
the
period
he
had
secretly
resented
the
autocracy
of
superintendent
ministers
and
during
the
remainder
he
had
learnt
that
superintendent
ministers
are
not
absolute
autocrats
he
was
neither
overworked
nor
underpaid
he
belonged
to
the
small
tradesman
class
and
keeping
a
shop
in
luke
s
square
he
might
well
have
worked
harder
for
less
money
than
he
now
earned
his
vocation
however
in
addition
to
its
desolating
nomadic
quality
had
other
grave
drawbacks
it
gave
him
contact
with
a
vast
number
of
human
beings
but
the
abnormal
proportion
among
them
of
visionaries
bigots
hypocrites
and
petty
falsified
his
general
estimate
of
humanity
again
the
canons
rigorously
forbade
him
to
think
freely
for
himself
on
the
subjects
which
in
theory
most
interested
him
with
the
result
that
he
had
remained
extremely
ignorant
through
the
very
fear
of
knowledge
that
he
was
a
warm
enemy
of
freedom
and
that
he
habitually
carried
intellectual
dishonesty
to
the
verge
of
cynicism
thirdly
he
was
obliged
always
to
be
diplomatic
except
of
course
with
his
family
and
nature
had
not
meant
him
for
the
diplomatic
career
he
was
so
sick
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
that
he
even
dreamed
diplomatic
dreams
as
a
will
dream
of
the
oar
and
so
little
gifted
for
the
rôle
that
he
wore
insignificant
tight
collars
never
having
perceived
the
immense
moral
advantage
conferred
on
the
diplomatist
by
a
high
loose
collar
also
he
was
sick
of
captivity
and
this
in
no
wise
lessened
his
objection
to
freedom
he
had
lost
all
youthful
enthusiasm
and
was
in
fact
equally
bored
with
earth
and
with
heaven
nevertheless
he
had
authority
and
security
he
was
accustomed
to
the
public
gaze
and
to
the
forms
of
deference
he
knew
that
he
was
as
secure
as
a
judge
and
far
more
secure
than
a
nothing
but
the
inconceivable
collapse
of
a
powerful
and
wealthy
sect
could
affect
his
position
or
his
livelihood
to
the
very
end
of
life
hence
beneath
his
weariness
and
his
professional
attitudinarianism
there
was
a
hint
of
the
that
had
its
piquancy
he
could
foresee
with
indifference
even
the
distant
but
approaching
day
when
he
would
have
to
rise
in
the
pulpit
and
assert
that
the
literal
inspiration
of
the
scriptures
was
not
and
never
had
been
an
essential
article
of
wesleyan
faith
edwin
blenched
at
the
apparition
of
peartree
that
even
auntie
hamps
should
dare
uninvited
to
bring
a
wesleyan
minister
to
the
party
was
startling
but
that
the
minister
should
be
peartree
staggered
him
for
twenty
years
and
more
edwin
had
secretly
and
sometimes
in
public
borne
a
tremendous
grudge
against
peartree
he
had
execrated
anathematised
and
utterly
excommunicated
peartree
and
had
extended
the
fearful
curse
to
his
family
all
his
ancestors
and
all
his
descendants
when
peartree
was
young
and
fervent
in
the
service
of
heaven
he
had
had
the
monstrous
idea
of
instituting
a
saturday
afternoon
bible
class
for
schoolboys
abetted
by
parents
and
cruel
he
had
caught
and
horribly
tortured
some
score
of
miserable
victims
of
whom
edwin
was
one
the
bitter
memory
of
those
weekly
thieved
from
him
and
made
desolate
by
a
sanctimonious
crank
had
never
softened
nor
had
edwin
ever
forgiven
peartree
it
was
at
the
sessions
of
the
bible
class
that
edwin
while
silently
perfecting
himself
in
the
art
of
profanity
and
blasphemy
had
in
secret
fury
envenomed
his
instinctive
mild
objection
to
the
dogma
the
ritual
and
the
spirit
of
conventional
christianity
especially
as
exemplified
in
wesleyan
methodism
he
had
left
peartree
s
bible
class
a
convinced
a
hater
and
despiser
of
all
that
the
wesleyan
chapel
and
peartree
stood
for
he
deliberately
was
not
impartial
and
he
took
a
horrid
pleasure
in
being
unfair
he
knew
well
that
methodism
had
produced
many
fine
characters
and
played
a
part
in
the
moral
development
of
the
race
but
he
would
not
listen
to
his
own
knowledge
nothing
could
extenuate
for
him
the
noxiousness
of
methodism
on
the
other
hand
he
was
full
of
glee
if
he
could
add
anything
to
the
indictment
against
it
and
christianity
huxley
s
controversial
victories
over
gladstone
were
then
occurring
in
the
monthly
press
and
he
acclaimed
them
with
enormous
gusto
when
he
first
read
that
the
virgin
birth
was
a
feature
of
sundry
creeds
more
ancient
than
christianity
his
private
satisfaction
was
intense
and
lasted
acutely
for
days
when
he
heard
that
methodism
had
difficulty
in
maintaining
its
supply
of
adequately
equipped
ministers
he
rejoiced
with
virulence
his
hostility
was
the
more
significant
in
that
it
was
concealed
embedded
like
a
foreign
substance
in
the
rather
suave
gentleness
of
his
nature
at
intervals
increasingly
frequent
it
is
true
he
would
carry
it
into
the
chapel
itself
for
through
mingled
cowardice
and
sharp
prudence
he
had
not
formally
left
the
connexion
to
compensate
himself
for
such
he
would
now
and
then
assert
judicially
to
a
reliable
male
friend
or
with
ferocious
contempt
to
a
scandalised
defenceless
sister
that
despite
all
parsons
religion
was
not
a
necessity
of
the
human
soul
and
that
he
personally
had
never
felt
the
need
of
it
and
never
would
in
which
assertion
he
was
profoundly
sincere
and
yet
throughout
he
had
always
thought
of
himself
as
a
rebel
against
authority
and
such
is
the
mysterious
intimidating
prestige
of
the
past
he
was
outwardly
an
apologetic
rebel
neither
his
intellectual
pride
nor
his
cold
sustained
resentment
nor
his
axiomatic
conviction
of
the
crude
and
total
falseness
of
christian
theology
nor
all
three
together
had
ever
sufficed
to
rid
him
of
the
air
when
auntie
hamps
spoke
with
careful
reverence
of
the
super
short
for
superintendent
minister
the
word
had
never
in
thirty
years
quite
failed
to
inspire
in
him
some
of
the
awe
with
which
he
had
heard
it
as
an
infant
just
as
a
policeman
was
not
an
employee
but
a
so
a
minister
was
not
a
person
of
the
who
happened
to
have
been
through
a
certain
educational
establishment
subscribed
to
certain
beliefs
submitted
to
certain
ceremonies
and
adopted
a
certain
costume
but
a
a
being
inexplicably
endowed
with
authority
in
fact
a
sort
of
and
thus
while
detesting
and
despising
him
edwin
had
never
thought
of
abel
peartree
as
merely
a
man
now
in
the
bustle
of
the
hall
after
an
interval
of
about
twenty
years
he
beheld
again
his
enemy
his
bugbear
his
loathed
oppressor
the
living
symbol
of
all
that
his
soul
condemned
said
hamps
i
reminded
peartree
that
you
used
to
attend
his
edwin
do
you
remember
i
hope
you
do
oh
yes
said
edwin
with
a
slight
nervous
laugh
blushing
his
eye
caught
clara
s
but
there
was
no
sign
whatever
of
the
old
malicious
grin
on
her
maternal
face
nor
did
maggie
s
show
a
tremor
and
of
course
the
majestic
duplicity
of
auntie
hamps
did
not
quiver
under
the
strain
so
that
the
rev
peartree
protesting
honestly
that
he
should
have
recognised
his
old
pupil
clayhanger
anywhere
never
suspected
the
terrific
drama
of
the
moment
and
the
next
moment
there
was
no
drama
teacher
and
pupil
shook
hands
the
recognition
was
mutual
to
edwin
peartree
save
for
the
greying
of
his
hair
had
not
changed
his
voice
his
form
his
gestures
were
absolutely
the
same
only
instead
of
being
peartree
he
was
a
man
like
another
man
a
commonplace
weary
man
a
spare
little
man
with
a
coat
and
low
collar
a
perfunctory
listless
man
with
an
unpleasant
voice
a
man
with
the
social
code
of
the
benbows
and
auntie
hamps
a
man
the
lines
of
whose
face
disclosed
a
narrow
and
ignorance
a
man
whose
destiny
had
forbidden
him
ever
to
be
natural
the
usual
snobbish
man
who
had
heard
of
the
importance
and
the
success
and
the
wealth
of
edwin
clayhanger
and
who
kowtowed
thereto
and
was
naïvely
impressed
thereby
and
proud
that
edwin
clayhanger
had
once
been
his
pupil
and
withal
an
average
decent
fellow
edwin
rather
liked
the
casual
look
in
peartree
s
eyes
that
said
my
being
here
is
part
of
my
job
i
m
indifferent
i
do
what
i
have
to
do
and
i
really
don
t
care
i
have
paid
tens
of
thousands
of
calls
and
i
shall
pay
tens
of
thousands
more
if
i
am
bored
i
am
paid
to
be
bored
and
i
repeat
i
really
don
t
care
this
was
the
human
side
of
peartree
showing
itself
it
endeared
him
to
edwin
not
a
bad
sort
of
cuss
after
all
thought
edwin
all
the
carefully
tended
rage
and
animosity
of
twenty
years
evaporated
out
of
his
heart
and
was
gone
he
did
not
forgive
peartree
because
there
was
no
peartree
there
was
only
this
man
and
there
was
no
wesleyan
chapel
either
but
only
an
ugly
forlorn
building
at
the
top
of
duck
bank
and
edwin
was
no
longer
an
apologetic
rebel
nor
even
any
kind
of
a
rebel
it
occurred
to
nobody
not
even
to
the
mighty
edwin
that
in
those
few
seconds
the
history
of
dogmatic
religion
had
passed
definitely
out
of
one
stage
into
another
abel
peartree
nonchalantly
and
with
a
practised
aplomb
which
was
not
disturbed
even
by
the
vision
of
george
s
heroic
stallion
said
the
proper
things
to
edwin
and
hilda
and
it
became
known
somehow
that
the
parson
was
bursley
in
order
to
deliver
his
lecture
entitled
the
mantle
and
mission
of
elijah
the
sole
lecture
of
his
repertoire
but
it
had
served
to
raise
him
ever
so
slightly
out
of
the
ruck
of
hilda
patronised
him
against
the
rich
background
of
her
home
she
assumed
the
pose
of
the
grand
lady
abel
peartree
seemed
to
like
the
pose
and
grew
momentarily
vivacious
in
knightly
response
and
why
not
said
edwin
to
himself
justifying
his
wife
after
being
a
little
critical
of
her
curtness
then
when
the
conversation
fell
auntie
hamps
discreetly
suggested
that
she
and
the
girls
should
go
upstairs
the
negligent
hilda
had
inexcusably
forgotten
in
her
nervous
excitement
that
on
these
occasions
arriving
ladies
should
be
at
once
escorted
to
the
best
bedroom
there
to
lay
their
things
on
the
best
counterpane
she
perhaps
ought
to
have
atoned
for
her
negligence
by
herself
leading
auntie
hamps
to
the
bedroom
but
instead
she
deputed
ada
and
why
not
said
edwin
to
himself
again
as
the
ladies
mounted
peartree
laughed
genuinely
at
one
of
albert
benbow
s
characteristic
pleasantries
which
always
engloomed
edwin
kindred
spirits
those
two
thought
the
superior
sardonic
edwin
and
privately
raised
his
eyebrows
to
his
wife
who
answered
the
signal
ii
somewhat
later
various
other
guests
having
come
and
distributed
themselves
over
the
the
chandeliers
glinted
down
their
rays
upon
light
summer
frocks
and
some
jewellery
and
coats
of
black
and
dark
grey
and
blue
and
the
best
counterpanes
in
the
best
bedroom
were
completely
hidden
by
mantles
and
cloaks
and
the
hatstand
in
the
hall
heavily
clustered
with
hats
and
caps
the
reception
was
in
being
and
the
interior
full
of
animation
edwin
watchful
and
hospitably
anxious
wandered
out
of
the
into
the
hall
the
door
of
the
was
ajar
and
he
could
hear
clara
s
voice
behind
it
he
knew
that
the
benbows
and
maggie
and
auntie
hamps
were
all
in
the
and
he
blamed
chiefly
clara
for
this
provincial
clannishness
which
was
so
characteristic
of
her
surely
auntie
hamps
at
any
rate
ought
to
have
realised
that
the
duty
of
members
of
the
family
was
to
spread
themselves
among
the
other
guests
he
listened
no
clara
was
saying
we
don
t
know
what
s
happened
to
him
since
he
came
out
of
prison
he
got
two
years
she
was
speaking
in
what
edwin
called
her
scandal
tones
low
clipped
intimate
eager
blissful
and
then
albert
benbow
s
voice
he
s
had
the
good
sense
not
to
bother
us
edwin
while
resenting
the
conversation
and
the
benbows
use
of
we
and
us
in
a
matter
which
did
not
concern
them
was
grimly
comforted
by
the
thought
of
their
ignorance
of
a
detail
which
would
have
interested
them
passionately
none
but
hilda
and
himself
knew
that
the
bigamist
was
at
that
moment
in
prison
again
for
another
and
a
later
offence
everything
had
been
told
but
that
of
course
said
clara
they
needn
t
have
said
anything
about
the
bigamy
at
all
and
nobody
outside
the
family
need
have
known
that
poor
hilda
was
not
just
an
ordinary
widow
but
we
all
thought
i
don
t
know
so
much
about
that
clary
albert
benbow
interrupted
his
wife
you
mustn
t
forget
his
real
wife
came
to
turnhill
to
make
enquiries
that
started
a
hare
well
you
know
what
i
mean
said
clara
vaguely
peartree
s
voice
came
in
but
surely
the
case
was
in
the
papers
i
expect
it
was
in
the
sussex
papers
albert
replied
you
see
they
went
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
at
lewes
but
it
never
got
into
the
local
rag
because
he
got
married
in
his
real
name
cannon
wasn
t
his
real
name
and
he
d
no
address
in
the
five
towns
then
he
was
just
a
keeper
at
brighton
it
was
a
miracle
it
didn
t
get
into
the
if
you
ask
me
but
it
didn
t
i
happen
to
know
his
voice
grew
important
that
the
people
have
an
arrangement
with
the
press
association
for
a
full
report
of
all
matrimonial
cases
that
ud
be
likely
to
interest
the
district
however
the
press
association
weren
t
quite
on
the
spot
that
time
and
it
s
not
surprising
they
weren
t
either
clara
resumed
no
it
never
came
out
still
as
i
say
we
all
thought
it
best
not
to
conceal
anything
albert
strongly
advised
edwin
not
to
attempt
any
such
thing
what
awful
rot
thought
edwin
so
we
just
mentioned
it
quietly
like
to
a
few
friends
after
all
poor
hilda
was
perfectly
innocent
of
course
she
felt
her
position
keenly
when
she
came
to
live
here
after
the
wedding
did
she
indeed
thought
edwin
edwin
would
have
the
wedding
in
london
we
did
so
feel
for
her
did
you
indeed
thought
edwin
she
wouldn
t
have
an
at
home
i
knew
it
was
a
mistake
not
to
we
all
knew
but
no
would
folks
began
to
talk
they
thought
it
strange
she
didn
t
have
an
at
home
like
other
folks
many
young
married
women
have
two
at
homes
nowadays
so
in
the
end
she
was
persuaded
she
fixed
it
for
august
because
she
thought
so
many
people
would
be
away
at
the
seaside
but
they
aren
t
at
least
not
so
many
as
you
d
think
albert
says
it
s
owing
to
the
general
election
upset
and
she
wouldn
t
have
it
in
the
afternoon
like
other
folks
edwin
isn
t
like
other
folks
and
you
can
t
alter
her
what
s
the
matter
with
the
evening
for
an
at
home
anyhow
asked
benbow
the
breezy
and
consciously
oh
of
course
quite
agree
i
like
it
but
folks
are
so
funny
after
a
momentary
pause
peartree
said
uncertainly
and
there
s
a
little
boy
said
clara
yes
the
one
you
ve
seen
said
auntie
hamps
poor
little
thing
i
do
feel
so
sorry
for
him
when
he
grows
up
you
needn
t
auntie
said
maggie
curtly
expressing
her
attitude
to
george
in
that
mild
curtness
of
course
said
clara
quickly
we
never
let
it
make
any
difference
in
fact
our
bert
and
he
are
rather
friends
aren
t
they
albert
at
this
moment
george
himself
opened
the
door
of
the
letting
out
a
faint
buzz
of
talk
and
clink
of
vessels
his
mouth
was
not
empty
precipitately
edwin
plunged
into
the
hello
you
people
he
murmured
well
mr
peartree
there
they
were
all
of
them
including
the
parson
grouped
together
lusciously
bathing
in
the
fluid
of
scandal
clara
turned
and
without
the
least
constraint
said
sweetly
oh
edwin
there
you
are
i
was
just
telling
peartree
about
you
and
hilda
you
know
we
thought
it
would
be
better
you
see
said
auntie
hamps
impressively
peartree
will
be
about
the
town
and
a
word
from
him
peartree
tried
unsuccessfully
to
look
as
if
he
was
nobody
in
particular
that
s
all
right
said
edwin
perhaps
the
door
might
as
well
be
shut
he
thought
as
many
a
man
has
thought
my
relations
take
the
cake
clara
occupied
the
only
easy
chair
in
the
room
hamps
and
the
parson
were
seated
maggie
stood
albert
benbow
ever
uxorious
was
perched
sideways
on
the
arm
of
his
wife
s
chair
clara
centre
of
the
conclave
and
of
all
conclaves
in
which
she
took
part
was
the
mother
of
five
children
and
nearing
years
of
age
maternity
had
ruined
her
once
slim
figure
but
neither
she
nor
albert
seemed
to
mind
that
they
seemed
rather
to
be
proud
of
her
unshapeliness
her
face
was
unspoiled
she
was
pretty
and
had
a
marvellously
fair
complexion
in
her
face
edwin
could
still
always
plainly
see
the
pert
charming
malicious
girl
of
fourteen
who
loathed
auntie
hamps
and
was
rude
to
her
behind
her
back
but
clara
and
auntie
hamps
were
fast
friends
nowadays
clara
s
brood
had
united
them
they
thought
alike
on
all
topics
clara
had
accepted
auntie
hamps
s
code
practically
entire
but
on
the
other
hand
she
had
dominated
auntie
hamps
the
respect
which
auntie
hamps
showed
for
clara
and
for
edwin
and
in
a
slightly
less
degree
for
maggie
was
a
strange
phenomenon
in
the
old
age
of
that
grandiose
and
vivacious
pillar
of
wesleyanism
and
the
conventions
edwin
did
not
like
clara
he
objected
to
her
domesticity
her
motherliness
her
luxuriant
fruitfulness
the
intonations
of
her
voice
her
intense
and
her
remarkable
duplicity
and
perhaps
more
than
anything
to
her
smug
provinciality
he
did
not
positively
dislike
his
but
he
objected
to
him
for
his
uxoriousness
his
cheerful
assurance
of
clara
s
perfection
his
contented
and
conceited
ignorance
of
all
intellectual
matters
his
incorrigible
vulgarity
of
a
small
manufacturer
who
displays
everywhere
the
stigmata
of
petty
commerce
and
his
ingenuous
love
of
office
as
for
maggie
the
plump
spinster
of
forty
edwin
respected
her
when
he
thought
of
her
but
reproached
her
for
social
gawkiness
and
taciturnity
as
for
auntie
hamps
he
could
not
respect
but
he
was
forced
to
admire
her
gorgeous
and
sustained
hypocrisy
in
which
no
flaw
had
ever
been
found
and
which
victimised
even
herself
he
was
always
invigorated
by
her
ageless
energy
and
the
sight
of
her
handsome
erect
valiant
figure
edwin
s
absence
had
stopped
the
natural
free
course
of
conversation
but
there
were
at
least
three
people
in
the
room
whom
nothing
could
abash
hamps
clara
and
peartree
peartree
sitting
up
with
his
hands
on
his
baggy
knees
said
everything
seems
to
have
turned
out
very
well
in
the
end
clayhanger
very
well
indeed
his
features
showed
less
of
the
tedium
of
life
eh
yes
eh
yes
breathed
auntie
hamps
in
ecstasy
edwin
diffident
and
was
about
to
suggest
that
the
family
might
advantageously
separate
when
george
came
after
him
into
the
room
oh
cried
george
well
little
jockey
clara
began
instantly
to
him
with
an
exaggerated
sweetness
that
edwin
thought
must
nauseate
the
child
would
you
like
bert
to
come
up
and
play
with
you
one
of
these
afternoons
george
stared
at
her
and
slowly
flushed
yes
said
george
only
only
what
supposing
i
was
doing
something
else
when
he
came
without
waiting
for
possible
developments
george
turned
to
leave
the
room
again
you
re
a
caution
you
are
said
albert
benbow
and
to
the
adults
hates
to
be
disturbed
i
suppose
that
s
it
said
edwin
responsively
as
to
but
he
felt
that
he
with
a
few
months
experience
of
another
s
child
appreciated
the
exquisite
strange
sensibility
of
children
infinitely
better
than
albert
were
he
fifty
times
a
father
what
is
a
caution
uncle
albert
asked
george
peeping
back
from
the
door
auntie
hamps
warned
the
child
of
the
danger
of
being
impertinent
to
his
elders
george
george
a
caution
is
a
caution
to
snakes
said
albert
shoo
making
a
noise
like
a
rocket
he
feinted
to
pursue
the
boy
with
violence
peartree
laughed
rather
loudly
and
rather
like
a
human
being
at
the
word
snakes
albert
benbow
s
flashes
of
humour
indeed
seemed
to
surprise
him
if
only
for
an
instant
out
of
his
attitudinarianism
clara
smiled
flattered
by
the
power
of
her
husband
to
reveal
the
humanity
of
the
parson
albert
s
so
good
with
children
she
said
he
always
knows
exactly
she
stopped
leaving
what
he
knew
exactly
to
the
listeners
imagination
uncle
albert
and
george
could
be
heard
scuffling
in
the
hall
auntie
hamps
rose
with
a
gentle
sigh
saying
i
suppose
we
ought
to
join
the
others
her
social
sense
which
was
pretty
well
developed
had
at
last
prevailed
the
sisters
maggie
and
clara
one
in
light
and
the
other
in
dark
green
walked
out
of
the
room
maggie
s
face
had
already
stiffened
into
mute
constraint
and
clara
s
into
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
general
company
iii
auntie
hamps
held
back
and
edwin
at
once
perceived
from
the
conspiratorial
glance
in
her
splendid
eyes
that
in
suggesting
a
move
she
had
intended
to
deceive
her
in
life
clara
but
auntie
hamps
could
not
live
without
chicane
and
she
was
happiest
when
she
had
superimposed
chicane
upon
chicane
in
complex
folds
she
put
a
ringed
hand
softly
but
arrestingly
upon
edwin
s
arm
and
pushed
the
door
to
alone
with
her
and
the
parson
edwin
felt
himself
to
be
at
bay
and
he
drew
back
before
an
unknown
menace
edwin
dear
said
she
peartree
has
something
to
suggest
to
you
i
was
going
to
say
a
favour
to
ask
but
i
won
t
put
it
like
that
i
m
sure
my
nephew
will
look
upon
it
as
a
privilege
you
know
how
much
peartree
has
at
heart
the
district
additional
chapels
fund
edwin
did
not
know
how
much
but
he
had
heard
of
the
macclesfield
district
additional
chapels
fund
bursley
being
one
of
the
circuits
in
the
macclesfield
district
wesleyanism
finding
itself
confronted
with
lessening
congregations
and
with
a
shortage
of
ministers
the
macclesfield
district
had
determined
to
prove
that
wesleyanism
was
nevertheless
spiritually
vigorous
by
the
odd
method
of
building
more
chapels
peartree
inventor
of
saturday
afternoon
for
schoolboys
was
one
of
the
originators
of
the
bricky
scheme
and
in
fact
his
lecture
upon
the
mantle
and
mission
of
elijah
was
to
be
in
aid
of
it
the
next
instant
peartree
had
invited
edwin
to
act
as
district
treasurer
of
the
fund
the
previous
treasurer
having
died
more
chicane
the
parson
s
visit
then
was
not
a
mere
friendly
call
inspired
by
the
moment
it
was
part
of
a
scheme
it
had
been
planned
against
him
did
they
he
seemed
to
be
asking
himself
think
him
so
ingenuous
so
simple
as
not
to
see
through
their
dodge
if
not
then
why
the
preliminary
pretences
he
did
not
really
ask
himself
these
questions
for
the
reason
that
he
knew
the
answers
to
them
when
a
piece
of
chicane
had
succeeded
auntie
hamps
forgot
it
and
expected
others
to
forget
it
or
at
any
rate
she
dared
by
her
magnificent
front
anybody
on
earth
to
remind
her
of
it
she
was
quite
indifferent
whether
edwin
saw
through
her
dodge
or
not
you
re
so
good
at
business
said
she
ah
she
would
insist
on
the
business
side
of
the
matter
affecting
to
ignore
the
immense
moral
significance
which
would
be
attached
to
edwin
s
acceptance
of
the
office
were
he
to
yield
the
triumph
for
methodism
would
ring
through
the
town
he
read
all
her
thoughts
nothing
could
break
down
her
magnificent
front
she
had
cornered
him
by
a
device
she
had
him
at
bay
and
she
counted
on
his
weak
on
his
cowardice
for
a
victory
peartree
talked
peartree
expressed
his
certitude
that
edwin
was
with
them
at
heart
and
his
absolute
reliance
upon
edwin
s
sense
of
the
responsibilities
of
a
man
in
his
edwin
s
position
auntie
hamps
recalled
with
fervour
edwin
s
early
activities
in
methodism
the
young
men
s
debating
society
for
example
which
met
at
six
o
clock
on
frosty
winter
mornings
for
the
proving
of
the
faith
by
dialectics
and
edwin
faltered
in
his
speech
you
ought
to
get
albert
he
feebly
suggested
oh
no
said
auntie
albert
is
grand
in
his
own
line
but
for
this
want
a
man
like
it
was
a
edwin
had
the
illusion
of
trembling
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
did
not
tremble
even
inwardly
he
seemed
to
see
the
forces
of
evolution
and
the
forces
of
reaction
ranged
against
each
other
in
a
supreme
crisis
he
seemed
to
see
the
alternative
of
two
futures
for
himself
and
in
one
he
would
be
a
humiliated
and
bored
slave
and
in
the
other
a
fine
reckless
ensign
of
freedom
he
seemed
to
be
doubtful
of
his
own
courage
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
he
was
not
doubtful
he
remembered
all
the
frightful
and
degrading
ennui
which
when
he
was
young
he
had
suffered
as
a
martyr
to
wesleyanism
and
dogma
all
the
sinister
deceptions
which
he
had
had
to
practise
and
which
had
been
practised
upon
him
he
remembered
his
almost
intense
hatred
of
peartree
and
he
might
have
clenched
his
hands
bitterly
and
said
with
homicidal
animosity
i
will
pay
you
out
and
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
and
i
will
wither
you
up
and
incinerate
you
and
be
revenged
for
everything
in
one
single
sentence
but
he
felt
no
bitterness
and
his
animosity
was
dead
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
there
was
nothing
but
a
bland
indifference
that
did
not
even
scorn
no
he
said
quietly
i
shan
t
be
your
treasurer
you
must
ask
somebody
else
a
vast
satisfaction
filled
him
the
refusal
was
so
easy
the
opposing
forces
so
negligible
auntie
hamps
and
peartree
knew
nothing
of
the
peculiar
phenomena
induced
in
edwin
s
mind
by
the
first
sight
of
the
legendary
abel
peartree
after
twenty
years
but
auntie
hamps
though
puzzled
for
an
explanation
comprehended
that
she
was
decisively
beaten
the
blow
was
hard
nevertheless
she
did
not
wince
the
superb
pretence
must
be
kept
up
and
she
kept
it
up
she
smiled
and
tossing
her
curls
checked
edwin
with
cheerful
indomitable
rapidity
now
now
don
t
decide
at
once
think
it
over
very
carefully
and
we
shall
ask
you
again
peartree
will
write
to
you
i
feel
sure
appearances
were
preserved
the
colloquy
was
interrupted
by
hilda
who
came
in
excited
gay
with
sparkling
eyes
humming
an
air
she
had
protested
vehemently
against
an
at
home
she
had
said
again
and
again
that
the
idea
of
an
at
home
was
abhorrent
to
her
and
that
she
hated
all
such
wholesale
formal
hospitalities
and
could
not
bear
people
and
yet
now
she
was
enchanted
with
her
situation
as
hostess
delighted
with
herself
and
her
rich
dress
almost
ecstatically
aware
of
her
own
attractiveness
and
domination
the
sight
of
her
gave
pleasure
and
communicated
zest
mature
she
was
yet
only
beginning
life
and
as
she
glanced
with
secret
condescension
at
the
listless
peartree
she
seemed
to
say
what
is
all
this
talk
of
heaven
and
hell
i
am
in
love
with
life
and
the
senses
and
everything
is
lawful
to
me
and
i
am
above
you
and
even
auntie
hamps
though
one
of
the
most
creatures
that
ever
lived
envied
in
her
glorious
decay
the
young
maturity
of
sensuous
hilda
well
said
hilda
what
s
going
on
they
re
all
gone
mad
about
missing
words
in
the
she
smiled
splendidly
at
edwin
whose
pride
in
her
thrilled
him
her
superiority
to
other
women
was
patent
she
made
other
women
seem
negative
in
fact
she
was
a
tingling
woman
before
she
was
anything
else
that
was
it
he
compared
her
with
clara
who
was
now
nothing
but
a
mother
and
to
maggie
who
had
never
been
anything
at
all
peartree
made
the
mistake
of
telling
her
the
subject
of
the
conversation
she
did
not
wait
to
hear
what
edwin
s
answer
had
been
she
said
curtly
and
with
finality
oh
no
i
won
t
have
it
edwin
did
not
quite
like
this
the
matter
concerned
him
alone
and
he
was
an
absolutely
free
agent
she
ought
to
have
phrased
her
objection
differently
for
example
she
might
have
said
i
hope
he
has
refused
still
his
annoyance
was
infinitesimal
the
poor
boy
works
quite
hard
enough
as
it
is
she
added
with
delicious
caressing
intonation
of
the
first
words
he
liked
that
but
she
was
confusing
the
issue
she
always
would
confuse
the
issue
it
was
not
because
the
office
would
involve
extra
work
for
him
that
he
had
declined
the
invitation
as
she
well
knew
of
course
auntie
hamps
said
in
a
flash
if
it
means
overwork
for
him
i
shouldn
t
dream
she
was
putting
the
safety
of
appearances
beyond
doubt
by
the
way
auntie
hilda
continued
what
s
the
trouble
about
the
pew
down
at
chapel
both
clara
and
maggie
have
mentioned
it
trouble
my
dear
exclaimed
auntie
hamps
justifiably
shocked
that
hilda
should
employ
such
a
word
in
the
presence
of
peartree
but
hilda
was
apt
to
be
headlong
to
the
pew
originally
taken
by
edwin
s
father
and
since
his
death
standing
in
edwin
s
name
clara
had
brought
her
husband
and
although
it
was
a
long
pew
the
fruits
of
the
marriage
had
gradually
filled
it
so
that
if
edwin
chanced
to
go
to
chapel
there
was
not
too
much
room
for
him
in
the
pew
which
presented
the
appearance
of
a
railway
carriage
crowded
with
holders
albert
benbow
had
suggested
that
edwin
should
yield
up
the
pew
to
the
benbows
and
take
a
smaller
pew
for
himself
and
hilda
and
george
but
the
women
had
expressed
fear
lest
edwin
might
not
like
this
break
in
a
historic
tradition
and
albert
benbow
had
been
forbidden
to
put
forward
the
suggestion
until
the
diplomatic
sex
had
examined
the
ground
we
shall
be
only
too
pleased
for
albert
to
take
over
the
pew
said
hilda
but
have
you
chosen
another
pew
hamps
looked
at
edwin
oh
no
said
hilda
lightly
but
now
auntie
the
tingling
woman
warned
auntie
hamps
as
one
powerful
individuality
may
warn
another
don
t
worry
about
us
you
know
we
re
not
great
she
spoke
the
astounding
words
gaily
but
firmly
she
could
be
firm
and
even
harsh
in
her
triumphant
happiness
edwin
knew
that
she
detested
auntie
hamps
auntie
hamps
no
doubt
also
knew
it
in
their
mutual
smilings
so
affable
so
hearty
so
appreciative
apparently
so
impulsive
the
hostility
between
them
gleamed
mysteriously
like
lightning
in
sunlight
edwin
s
family
were
church
of
england
said
auntie
hamps
in
the
direction
of
peartree
nor
great
either
hilda
finished
cheerfully
no
woman
had
ever
made
such
outrageous
remarks
in
the
five
towns
before
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
a
man
might
have
said
as
much
without
suffering
in
esteem
might
indeed
have
earned
a
certain
intellectual
prestige
by
the
declaration
but
it
was
otherwise
with
a
woman
both
hamps
and
the
minister
thought
that
hilda
was
not
going
the
right
way
to
live
down
her
dubious
past
even
edwin
in
his
pride
was
flurried
great
matters
however
had
been
accomplished
not
only
had
the
attack
of
auntie
hamps
and
peartree
been
defeated
but
the
defence
had
become
an
onslaught
not
only
was
he
not
the
treasurer
of
the
district
additional
chapels
fund
but
he
had
practically
ceased
to
be
a
member
of
the
congregation
he
was
free
with
a
freedom
which
he
had
never
had
the
audacity
to
hope
for
it
was
incredible
yet
there
it
was
a
word
said
bravely
in
a
particular
tone
and
a
new
epoch
was
begun
the
pity
was
that
he
had
not
done
it
all
himself
hilda
s
courage
had
surpassed
his
own
women
were
astounding
they
were
disconcerting
too
his
manly
independence
was
ever
so
little
wounded
by
hilda
s
boldness
in
initiative
on
their
joint
behalf
do
come
and
take
something
auntie
said
hilda
with
the
most
winning
the
most
loving
inflection
auntie
hamps
passed
out
hilda
turned
back
into
the
room
do
go
with
auntie
peartree
i
must
just
she
affected
to
search
for
something
on
the
mantelpiece
peartree
passed
out
he
was
unmoved
he
did
not
care
in
his
heart
and
as
edwin
caught
his
indifferent
eye
with
that
it
glint
in
it
his
soul
warmed
again
slightly
to
peartree
and
further
peartree
s
aloof
unworldliness
his
personal
practical
unconcern
with
money
feasting
ambition
and
all
the
grosser
forms
of
made
edwin
feel
somewhat
a
sensual
average
man
and
accordingly
humiliated
him
as
soon
as
almost
before
peartree
was
beyond
the
door
hilda
leaped
at
edwin
and
kissed
him
violently
the
door
was
not
closed
he
could
hear
the
varied
hum
of
the
party
i
had
to
kiss
you
while
it
s
all
going
on
she
whispered
ardent
vitality
shimmered
in

just
crossing

hall
to

said
edwin
stopping
her
with
a
gesture
towards
the
telegram
it
s
for
tom
swetnam
sir
edwin
and
hilda
followed
the
starched
and
fussy
girl
into
the
in
which
were
about
a
dozen
people
including
fearns
the
lawyer
and
his
wife
the
recently
married
stephen
and
vera

several
swetnams

janet

tom

standing
up

i
never

they
delivered

at

said
fearns
sharply
looking
at
his
watch
he
was

to
keep
a
careful
eye
on

and

of

called

naughtily
glad
to
plague
a
man
older
than
himself
and
the
father
of
a

tom
was
a
mere
son
but
he
had
travelled
and
was
indeed
just
returned
from
an
excursion
through
scandinavia
observe
there
s
no

the
envelope
s

opened
moreover
it
s
addressed
to

not

me
ben
s
sent
it
up
i
asked
him
to
now
we
ll
see
having
displayed
the
envelope
like
a
conjurer
he
drew
forth
the
telegram
and
prepared
to
read
it
aloud
one
half
of
the
company
was
puzzled
the
other
half
showed
an
instructed
excitement
tom
read
the
message
pounds
ten
nine
philosophers
tell
us
that
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
nevertheless
it
may
well
be
doubted
whether
the
discovery
of
gold
at
barmouth
together
with
two
earthquake
shocks
following
each
other
in
quick
succession
in
the
same
district
does
not
constitute
in
the
history
of
the
gallant
little
principality
a

of

he
stopped
vera

elegant
cried
out
with
all
the
impulsiveness
of
her
nature

whatever
is
it
all
about

and
dignified
youngish

motherhood
had
made
somewhat

competition
fearns
explained
to
her
with
curt
genial
superiority
he
laughed
outright
you
do
go
it
some
of
you
chaps
he
said
why
that
telegram
cost
over
a
couple
of
bob
i

well
you
see
said
tom
swetnam
three
of
us
share
it
we
get
it
hours
before
the
paper
s
out
fellow
in
london
and
there
s
so
much
more
time
to
read
the

no

half
doing
a

pounds
odd
not
a
bad
share
this
week
eh
won
anything
rather
we
had
the
wire
about
the
winning
word
this
morning
we
d
sent
it
in
four
times
that
makes
about
doesn
t
it
between

of

we
sent
in
nearly
two
hundred
postal
orders
which
leaves
clear
quid
apiece
net
he
tried
to
speak
calmly
and
nonchalantly
but
his
excitement
was
extreme
the
two
younger
swetnams
regarded
him
with
awe
everybody
was
deeply
impressed
by
the
prodigious
figures
and
in
many
hearts
envy
covetousness
and
the
wild
desire
for
a
large
free
life
of
luxury
were
aroused
seems
to
me
you
ve
reduced
this
game
to
a
science
said
edwin
well
we
have
tom
swetnam
admitted
we
send
in

it

fearns
at
the
rate
of

albert

caught
the

phrase

properly
whetted
his
curiosity

closely
on
nearly
all
ceremonial
occasions
these
two
had
an
instinctive
need
of
each
other
s
presence
and
support
and
if
albert
did
not
run
after
clara
clara
ran
after
albert
ii
then
came
the
proof
of
the
genius
the
cynicism
and
the
insight
of
the
leviathan
who
had
invented
the
dodge
of
inviting
his
readers
to
risk
a
shilling
and
also
to
buy
a
coupon
for
the
privilege
of
supplying
a
missing
word
upon
the
understanding
that
the
shillings
of
those
who
supplied
the
wrong
word
should
be
taken
for
ever
away
from
them
and
given
to
those
who
supplied
the
right
word
the
entire
company
in
the
clayhanger
was
absorbed
in
the
tremendous
topic
and
listened
to
swetnam
as
to
a
new
prophet
bearing
the
secret
of
eternal
felicity
the
rumour
of
swetnam
s
triumph
drew
people
out
of
the
delectable
to
listen
to
his
remarks
and
among
these
was
auntie
hamps
so
it
was
in
a
thousand
in
ten
thousand
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
homes
of
all
kinds
throughout
the
kingdom
the
leviathan
journalist
s
readers
though
as
a
rule
they
read
nothing
in
his
paper
save
the
truncated
paragraph
and
the
rules
of
the
competition
had
grown
to
be
equivalent
to
the
whole
british
public
and
he
not
only
held
them
but
he
had
overshadowed
all
other
interests
in
their
minds
upon
honeymoons
people
thought
of
the
amid
caresses
and
it
is
a
fact
that
people
had
died
with
the
missing
word
on
their
lips
sane
adults
of
both
sexes
read
the
dictionary
through
from
end
to
end
every
week
with
an
astounding
conscientiousness
the
leviathan
could
not
buy
enough
paper
nor
hire
sufficient
presses
to
meet
the
national
demands
and
no
wonder
seeing
that
any
small
in
a
side
street
was
liable
at
any
moment
to
receive
an
order
from
an
impassioned
student
of
periodical
literature
for
more
copies
of
one
issue
of
the
journal
than
the
whole
town
had
been
used
to
buy
before
the
marvellous
invention
of
the
the
post
office
was
incommoded
even
the
postmaster
general
was
incommoded
and
only
by
heroical
efforts
and
miraculous
feats
of
resourcefulness
did
he
save
himself
from
the
ignominy
of
running
out
of
shilling
postal
orders
post
office
girls
sold
shilling
postal
orders
with
a
sarcastic
smile
with
acerbity
with
reluctance
it
was
naught
to
them
that
the
revenue
was
benefited
and
the
pressure
on
taxpayers
eased
employers
throughout
the
islands
suffered
vast
losses
owing
to
the
fact
that
for
months
their
offices
and
factories
were
inhabited
not
by
clerks
and
other
employees
but
by
monomaniacs
who
did
naught
but
read
dictionaries
and
cut
out
and
fill
up
coupons
and
over
all
the
land
there
hung
the
dark
incredible
menace
of
an
unjust
prosecution
under
the
gambling
laws
urged
by
interfering
busybodies
who
would
not
let
a
nation
alone
and
how
much
did
you
make
last
week
mr
swetnam
judicially
asked
albert
benbow
who
was
rather
pleased
and
flattered
as
an
active
wesleyan
to
rub
shoulders
with
frank
men
of
the
world
like
tom
as
an
active
wesleyan
he
had
hitherto
utterly
refused
to
listen
to
the
but
now
it
seemed
to
be
acquiring
respectability
enough
for
his
ears
swetnam
replied
with
a
casual
air
we
didn
t
make
much
last
week
we
won
something
of
course
we
win
every
week
that
s
a
mathematical
certainty
but
sometimes
the
expenses
mount
up
a
bit
higher
than
the
receipts
it
depends
on
the
word
if
it
s
an
ordinary
word
that
everybody
chooses
naturally
the
share
is
a
small
one
because
there
are
so
many
winners
he
gave
no
more
exact
details
clara
breathed
a
disillusioned
oh
implying
that
she
had
known
there
must
be
some
flaw
in
the
scheme
and
her
husband
had
at
once
put
his
finger
on
it
but
her
husband
with
incipient
enthusiasm
for
the
word
said
well
it
stands
to
reason
they
must
take
one
week
with
another
and
average
it
out
now
albert
now
albert
edwin
warned
him
no
gambling
albert
replied
with
some
warmth
i
don
t
see
that
there
s
any
gambling
in
it
appears
to
me
that
it
s
chiefly
skill
and
thoroughness
that
does
the
trick
gambling
murmured
tom
swetnam
shortly
of
course
it
s
not
gambling
no
well
said
vera
cheswardine
i
say
a
double
event
of
unique
that
s
it
i
shouldn
t
go
nap
on
novelty
if
i
were
you
said
tom
swetnam
the
expert
tom
read
the
thing
again
novelty
vera
repeated
i
know
it
s
novelty
i
m
always
right
aren
t
i
stephen
she
looked
round
ask
stephen
you
were
right
last
week
but
one
my
child
said
stephen
and
did
you
make
anything
clara
demanded
eagerly
only
fifteen
shillings
said
vera
discontentedly
but
if
stephen
had
listened
to
me
we
should
have
made
lots
albert
benbow
s
interest
in
the
word
was
strengthened
fearns
leaning
carefully
back
in
his
chair
asked
with
fine
indifference
by
the
way
what
is
this
week
s
word
tom
i
haven
t
your
secret
sources
of
information
i
have
to
wait
for
the
paper
unaccountably
said
tom
had
you
anything
on
it
no
fearns
admitted
i
ve
caught
a
cold
this
week
it
seems
albert
benbow
stared
at
him
here
was
another
competitor
and
as
acute
a
man
of
business
as
you
would
find
in
the
five
towns
me
too
said
edwin
smiling
like
a
culprit
hilda
sprang
up
gleefully
and
pointed
at
him
a
finger
of
delicious
censure
oh
you
wicked
sinner
you
never
told
me
you
d
gone
in
you
deceitful
old
thing
well
it
was
a
man
at
the
shop
who
would
have
me
try
edwin
boyishly
excused
himself
iii
hilda
s
vivacity
enchanted
edwin
the
charm
of
her
reproof
was
simply
exquisite
in
its
and
in
the
elegance
of
its
gesture
the
lingering
taste
of
the
feverish
kiss
she
had
given
him
a
few
minutes
earlier
bemused
him
and
he
flushed
to
conceal
his
inconvenient
happiness
in
the
thought
of
his
wife
he
turned
to
open
the
new
enlarged
window
that
gave
on
the
garden
he
had
done
away
with
the
old
of
the
house
and
thrown
the
side
corridor
into
the
then
he
moved
towards
janet
orgreave
who
was
still
seated
at
the
closed
piano
your
father
isn
t
coming
i
suppose
he
asked
her
the
angelic
spinster
stylishly
dressed
in
white
and
wearing
as
usual
her
kind
heart
on
her
sleeve
smiled
with
soft
benignity
and
shook
her
head
he
told
me
to
tell
you
he
was
too
old
he
is
you
know
and
how
s
your
mother
oh
pretty
well
considering
i
really
ought
not
to
leave
them
oh
yes
edwin
protested
the
momentary
vision
of
and
orgreave
in
the
large
house
close
by
now
practically
deserted
by
all
their
children
except
janet
saddened
him
then
a
loud
voice
dominated
the
general
conversation
behind
him
i
say
this
is
a
bit
stiff
i
did
think
i
should
be
free
of
it
here
but
no
same
old
everywhere
what
is
it
this
week
swetnam
it
was
johnnie
orgreave
appreciably
younger
than
his
sister
but
a
man
of
the
world
and
somewhat
dandiacal
after
shaking
hands
with
hilda
he
came
straight
to
edwin
awfully
sorry
i
m
so
late
old
chap
how
do
jan
of
course
you
are
edwin
quizzed
him
like
an
uncle
where
s
ingpen
not
come
not
come
he
said
he
should
be
here
at
eight
just
like
him
said
johnnie
i
expect
he
s
had
a
puncture
i
ve
been
looking
out
for
him
every
minute
edwin
muttered
in
the
middle
of
the
room
albert
benbow
stocky
and
vulgar
but
feeling
himself
more
and
more
a
man
of
the
world
among
men
and
women
of
the
world
was
proclaiming
not
without
excitement
well
i
agree
with
cheswardine
novelty
s
much
more
likely
than
interest
s
the
wrong
kind
of
word
altogether
it
doesn
t
agree
with
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
that
s
right
benbow
vera
encouraged
him
with
flirtatious
dimples
you
put
your
money
on
me
even
if
my
own
husband
won
t
albert
as
a
dowdy
dissenter
was
quite
out
of
her
expensive
sphere
but
to
vera
any
man
was
a
man
now
albert
clara
warned
him
if
you
win
anything
you
must
give
it
to
me
for
the
new
perambulator
dash
that
girl
s
infernal
domesticity
thought
edwin
savagely
who
says
i
m
going
in
for
it
missis
albert
challenged
i
only
say
you
do
dear
clara
said
smoothly
then
i
albert
announced
the
great
decision
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
will
thank
ye
mrs
cheswardine
he
glanced
at
cheswardine
as
a
knight
at
his
unattainable
mistress
indeed
the
decision
had
in
it
something
of
the
chivalrous
the
attention
of
slim
provocative
vera
costliest
and
most
fashionably
dressed
woman
in
bursley
had
stirred
his
fancy
to
wander
far
beyond
its
usual
limits
albert
well
i
never
exclaimed
hamps
you
don
t
mind
do
you
auntie
said
albert
jovially
standing
over
her
not
if
it
s
not
gambling
said
hamps
stoutly
and
i
hope
it
isn
t
and
it
would
be
very
nice
for
clara
i
m
sure
if
you
won
hurrah
for
mrs
hamps
johnnie
orgreave
almost
yelled
at
the
same
moment
janet
orgreave
swinging
round
on
the
lifted
the
lid
of
the
piano
and
still
with
her
soft
angelic
smile
played
loudly
and
dashingly
the
barbaric
bacchic
orgiastic
melody
which
had
just
recently
inflamed
england
scotland
ireland
wales
and
the
five
towns
the
air
which
was
unlike
anything
ever
heard
before
by
british
ears
and
which
meant
nothing
whatever
that
could
be
avowed
the
air
which
heralded
social
revolutions
and
inaugurated
a
new
epoch
and
as
the
ringed
fingers
of
the
quiet
fading
spinster
struck
out
the
shocking
melody
vera
cheswardine
and
one
or
two
others
who
had
been
to
london
and
there
seen
the
great
legendary
figure
lottie
collins
hummed
more
or
less
brazenly
the
syllables
heavy
with
mysterious
significance
upon
this
entered
peartree
like
a
figure
of
retribution
and
silence
fell
i
m
afraid
he
began
mr
benbow
they
spoke
together
a
scared
had
come
up
from
the
benbow
home
with
the
affrighting
news
that
bert
benbow
who
had
gone
to
bed
with
the
other
children
as
usual
was
not
in
his
bed
and
could
not
be
discovered
in
the
house
peartree
being
in
the
hall
had
chosen
himself
to
bear
the
grievous
tidings
to
the
in
an
instant
albert
and
clara
were
parents
again
both
had
an
idea
that
the
unprecedented
incomprehensible
calamity
was
a
heavenly
dispensation
to
punish
them
for
having
trifled
with
the
their
sudden
seriousness
was
terrific
they
departed
immediately
without
ceremony
of
any
sort
hamps
said
that
she
really
ought
to
go
too
and
maggie
said
that
as
auntie
hamps
was
going
she
also
would
go
the
parson
said
that
he
had
already
stayed
longer
than
he
ought
in
view
of
another
engagement
and
he
followed
edwin
and
hilda
dutifully
saw
them
off
and
were
as
serious
as
the
circumstances
demanded
but
those
who
remained
in
the
sniggered
and
when
hilda
rejoined
them
she
laughed
the
house
felt
lighter
edwin
remaining
longest
at
the
door
saw
a
bicyclist
on
one
of
the
still
quaint
safety
bicycles
coming
along
behind
a
king
of
the
road
lamp
the
rider
dismounted
at
the
corner
that
you
mr
ingpen
said
a
blithe
voice
how
d
ye
do
host
when
you
ve
known
me
a
bit
longer
you
ll
learn
that
i
always
manage
to
arrive
just
when
other
people
are
leaving
chapter
v
tertius
ingpen
i
tertius
ingpen
was
the
new
district
factory
inspector
a
man
of
about
neither
fair
nor
dark
neither
tall
nor
short
he
was
a
native
of
the
district
having
been
born
somewhere
in
the
aristocratic
regions
between
knype
and
the
lordly
village
of
sneyd
but
what
first
struck
the
local
observer
in
him
was
that
his
speech
had
none
of
the
local
accent
in
the
pursuit
of
his
vocation
he
had
lived
in
other
places
than
the
five
towns
for
example
in
london
where
he
had
become
acquainted
with
edwin
s
friend
charlie
orgreave
the
doctor
when
ingpen
received
a
goodish
appointment
amid
the
industrial
horrors
of
his
birth
charlie
orgreave
recommended
him
to
edwin
and
edwin
and
ingpen
had
met
once
under
arrangement
made
by
johnnie
orgreave
it
was
johnnie
who
had
impulsively
suggested
in
ingpen
s
presence
that
ingpen
should
be
invited
to
the
at
home
edwin
rather
intimidated
by
ingpen
s
had
said
you
ll
run
up
against
a
mixed
lot
but
ingpen
though
sternly
critical
of
local
phenomena
seemed
to
be
ready
to
meet
social
adventures
in
a
broad
and
even
eager
spirit
of
curiosity
concerning
mankind
he
was
not
uncomely
and
he
possessed
a
short
silky
beard
of
which
secretly
he
was
not
less
proud
than
of
his
striking
name
he
wore
a
neat
blue
suit
with
the
trousers
fastened
tightly
round
the
ankles
for
and
thick
kid
gloves
he
took
off
one
glove
to
shake
hands
and
then
having
leisurely
removed
the
other
and
talking
all
the
time
he
bent
down
with
care
and
loosed
his
trousers
and
shook
them
into
shape
now
what
about
this
jigger
he
asked
while
still
bending
i
don
t
care
to
leave
it
anywhere
it
s
a
good
jigger
as
it
leaned
on
one
pedal
against
the
kerb
of
hulton
street
the
jigger
appeared
to
be
at
any
rate
a
very
dirty
jigger
fastened
under
the
saddle
were
a
roll
of
paper
and
a
mackintosh
there
are
one
or
two
ordinaries
knocking
about
the
place
said
edwin
but
we
haven
t
got
a
proper
i
ll
find
a
place
for
it
somewhere
in
the
garden
he
lifted
the
front
wheel
don
t
trouble
please
i
ll
take
it
said
ingpen
and
before
picking
up
the
machine
blew
out
the
lamp
whose
extinction
left
a
great
darkness
down
the
slope
of
hulton
street
you
ve
got
a
very
nice
place
here
too
central
for
me
of
course
ingpen
began
after
they
had
insinuated
the
bicycle
through
narrow
paths
to
the
back
of
the
house
edwin
was
leading
him
along
the
side
of
the
lawn
furthest
away
from
trafalgar
road
certainly
the
property
had
the
air
of
being
a
very
nice
place
the
garden
with
its
screen
of
high
rustling
trees
seemed
spacious
and
mysterious
in
the
gloom
and
the
lighted
windows
of
the
house
produced
an
effect
of
much
richness
especially
the
window
of
the
fearns
and
cheswardine
were
standing
in
front
of
it
chatting
doubtless
of
affairs
with
that
important
adult
air
which
edwin
himself
could
never
successfully
imitate
behind
them
were
bright
women
and
the
brilliant
chandelier
the
piano
faintly
sounded
edwin
was
proud
of
his
very
nice
place
how
strange
he
thought
this
is
all
mine
these
are
my
guests
and
my
wife
is
mine
well
you
see
he
answered
ingpen
s
criticism
with
false
humility
i
ve
no
choice
i
ve
got
to
be
central
ingpen
answered
pleasantly
i
take
your
word
for
it
but
i
don
t
see
the
bicycle
was
carefully
bestowed
by
its
groping
owner
in
a
small
rustic
arbour
which
situated
almost
under
the
wall
that
divided
the
clayhanger
property
from
the
first
cottage
in
hulton
street
was
hidden
from
the
house
by
a
clump
of
bushes
in
the
dark
privacy
of
this
shelter
tertius
ingpen
said
in
a
reflective
tone
i
understand
that
you
haven
t
been
married
long
and
that
this
is
a
sort
of
function
to
inform
the
world
officially
that
you
re
no
longer
what
you
were
it
s
something
like
that
edwin
admitted
with
a
laugh
he
liked
the
quiet
intimacy
of
ingpen
s
voice
whose
delicate
inflections
indicated
highly
cultivated
sensibilities
and
he
thought
i
believe
i
shall
be
friends
with
this
chap
and
was
glad
and
faith
in
ingpen
was
planted
in
his
heart
well
ingpen
continued
i
wish
you
happiness
it
may
seem
a
strange
thing
to
say
to
a
man
in
your
position
but
my
opinion
is
that
the
proper
place
for
women
is
behind
the
veil
only
my
personal
opinion
of
course
but
i
m
entitled
to
hold
it
and
therefore
to
express
it
whatever
his
matter
his
manner
was
faultless
yes
edwin
murmured
awkwardly
what
on
earth
did
ingpen
expect
by
way
of
reply
to
such
a
proposition
surely
ingpen
should
have
known
that
he
was
putting
his
host
in
a
disagreeable
difficulty
his
faith
in
ingpen
felt
the
harsh
wind
of
experience
and
shivered
nevertheless
there
was
a
part
of
edwin
that
responded
to
ingpen
s
attitude
behind
the
veil
yes
something
could
be
said
for
the
proposition
they
left
the
arbour
in
silence
they
had
not
gone
more
than
a
few
steps
when
a
boy
s
shrill
voice
made
itself
heard
over
the
wall
of
the
cottage
yard
oh
lord
thou
ast
said
if
two
on
ye
sh
ll
agray
on
earth
as
touching
onything
that
they
sh
ll
ask
it
sh
ll
be
done
for
them
of
my
father
which
is
in
eaven
for
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
i
my
name
theer
am
i
in
th
midst
of
em
oh
lord
george
edwin
clay
anger
wants
a
penknife
we
all
three
on
us
want
ye
to
send
george
edwin
clay
anger
a
penknife
the
words
fell
with
impressive
effect
on
the
men
in
the
garden
what
the
edwin
exclaimed
hsh
ingpen
stopped
him
in
an
excited
whisper
don
t
disturb
them
for
anything
in
the
world
silence
followed
edwin
crept
away
like
a
scout
towards
a
swing
which
he
had
arranged
for
his
friend
george
before
he
became
the
husband
of
george
s
mother
he
climbed
into
it
and
over
the
wall
could
just
see
three
boys
heads
in
the
yard
illuminated
by
a
lamp
in
the
of
the
cottage
tertius
ingpen
joined
him
but
immediately
climbed
higher
on
to
the
horizontal
beam
of
the
swing
who
are
they
ingpen
asked
restraining
his
joy
in
the
adventure
the
one
on
the
right
s
my
stepson
the
other
big
one
is
my
sister
clara
s
child
bert
i
expect
the
little
one
s
old
clowes
the
gravedigger
s
kid
they
say
he
s
a
regular
little
parson
probably
to
make
up
for
his
parents
i
expect
they
re
out
somewhere
having
a
jollification
well
ingpen
breathed
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
this
for
a
good
deal
he
gave
a
deep
almost
soundless
giggle
edwin
was
startled
as
much
as
anything
by
the
extraordinary
deceitfulness
of
george
who
could
possibly
have
guessed
from
the
boy
s
demeanour
when
his
aunt
clara
mentioned
bert
to
him
that
he
had
made
an
outrageous
rendezvous
with
bert
that
very
night
certainly
he
had
blushed
but
then
he
often
blushed
of
course
the
benbows
would
assert
that
george
had
seduced
the
guileless
bert
fancy
them
hunting
the
town
for
bert
at
that
instant
as
regards
peter
clowes
george
though
not
positively
forbidden
to
do
so
had
been
warned
against
associating
with
him
chiefly
because
of
the
bad
influence
which
peter
s
accent
would
have
on
george
s
accent
his
mother
had
said
that
she
could
not
understand
how
george
could
wish
to
be
friendly
with
a
rough
little
boy
like
peter
edwin
however
inexperienced
as
he
was
had
already
comprehended
that
children
like
eastern
women
have
no
natural
class
bias
and
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
be
the
first
to
inculcate
into
george
ideas
which
could
only
be
called
snobbish
he
was
a
democrat
nevertheless
he
did
not
like
george
to
play
with
peter
clowes
the
small
peter
with
uplifted
face
and
clasped
hands
repeated
urgently
passionately
o
god
we
all
three
on
us
want
ye
to
send
george
edwin
clay
anger
a
penknife
now
lads
kneel
and
all
three
on
us
together
he
stood
between
the
taller
and
boys
unashamed
fervent
a
born
religionist
he
was
not
even
praying
for
himself
he
was
praying
out
of
his
profound
impersonal
interest
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
the
three
boys
kneeling
and
so
disappearing
from
sight
behind
the
wall
repeated
together
o
god
please
send
george
edwin
clayhanger
a
penknife
then
george
and
bert
stood
up
again
shuffling
about
peter
clowes
did
not
reappear
i
can
t
help
it
whispered
ingpen
in
a
strange
moved
voice
i
ve
got
to
be
god
here
goes
and
it
s
practically
new
too
edwin
in
the
darkness
could
see
him
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
then
raise
his
arm
and
taking
careful
aim
throw
in
the
direction
of
the
dimly
lighted
yard
oh
came
the
cry
of
george
in
sudden
pain
the
descending
penknife
had
hit
him
in
the
face
there
was
a
scramble
on
the
pavement
of
the
yard
and
some
muttered
talk
the
group
went
to
the
back
window
where
the
lamp
was
and
examined
the
heavenly
penknife
they
were
more
frightened
than
delighted
by
the
miracle
the
unseen
watchers
in
the
swing
were
also
rather
frightened
as
though
they
had
interfered
irremediably
in
a
solemn
and
delicate
crisis
beyond
their
competence
in
a
curious
way
they
were
ashamed
yes
and
what
about
me
said
the
voice
of
fat
bert
benbow
sulkily
this
is
all
very
well
but
what
about
me
ye
tried
without
me
and
ye
couldn
t
do
anything
now
i
ve
come
and
ye
ve
done
it
what
am
i
going
to
get
ye
ve
got
to
give
me
something
instead
of
a
in
that
penknife
george
george
said
let
s
pray
for
something
for
you
now
what
d
you
want
i
want
a
bicycle
ye
know
what
i
want
oh
no
you
don
t
bert
benbow
said
george
you
ve
got
to
want
something
safer
than
a
bike
suppose
it
comes
tumbling
down
like
the
penknife
did
we
shall
be
dam
well
killed
tertius
ingpen
could
not
suppress
a
snorting
giggle
i
want
a
bike
bert
insisted
and
i
don
t
want
nothin
else
the
two
bigger
boys
moved
vaguely
away
from
the
window
and
the
little
religionist
followed
them
in
silence
ready
to
supplicate
for
whatever
they
should
decide
all
right
george
agreed
we
ll
pray
for
a
bicycle
but
we
d
better
all
stand
as
close
as
we
can
to
the
wall
under
the
spouting
in
case
the
ceremonial
was
recommenced
no
ingpen
murmured
i
m
not
being
god
this
time
it
won
t
run
to
it
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
lawn
behind
the
swing
ingpen
slid
down
and
edwin
jumped
down
johnnie
orgreave
was
approaching
hsh
ingpen
warned
him
what
are
you
chaps
hsh
ingpen
was
more
imperative
all
three
men
walked
away
out
of
earshot
of
the
yard
towards
the
window
of
the
johnnie
orgreave
mystified
the
other
two
smiling
but
with
spirits
disturbed
johnnie
heard
the
story
in
brief
it
was
told
to
him
in
confidence
as
tertius
ingpen
held
firmly
that
eavesdroppers
if
they
had
any
honour
left
should
at
least
hold
their
tongues
ii
when
tertius
ingpen
was
introduced
to
hilda
in
the
the
three
men
having
entered
by
the
french
window
edwin
was
startled
and
relieved
by
the
deportment
of
the
orientalist
who
thought
that
the
proper
place
for
women
was
behind
the
veil
in
his
simplicity
he
had
assumed
that
the
orientalist
would
indicate
his
attitude
by
a
dignified
reserve
not
at
all
as
soon
as
ingpen
reached
hilda
s
hospitable
gaze
his
whole
bearing
altered
he
bowed
with
a
deferential
bending
that
to
an
untravelled
native
must
have
seemed
exaggerated
his
face
was
transformed
by
a
sweet
smile
his
voice
became
the
voice
of
a
courtier
he
shook
hands
with
chivalrous
solicitude
for
the
fragile
hand
shaken
hilda
was
pleased
by
him
perceiving
that
this
man
was
more
experienced
in
the
world
than
any
of
the
other
worldly
guests
she
liked
that
ingpen
s
new
symptoms
were
modified
after
a
few
moments
but
when
he
was
presented
to
fearns
he
reproduced
them
in
their
original
intensity
and
again
when
he
was
introduced
to
vera
cheswardine
been
out
without
your
cap
hilda
questioned
edwin
lifting
her
eyebrows
she
said
it
in
order
to
say
something
for
the
entry
of
this
ceremonious
personage
who
held
all
the
advantages
of
the
native
and
of
the
stranger
had
a
little
overpowered
the
company
only
just
to
see
after
ingpen
s
machine
give
me
your
cap
ingpen
i
ll
hang
it
up
when
he
returned
to
the
from
the
hatstand
ingpen
was
talking
with
janet
orgreave
whom
he
already
knew
have
you
seen
george
edwin
hilda
called
across
the
hasn
t
he
gone
to
bed
that
s
what
i
want
to
know
i
haven
t
seen
him
lately
everyone
except
johnnie
orgreave
and
a
swetnam
or
so
was
preoccupied
by
the
thought
of
children
by
the
thought
of
this
incalculable
and
disturbing
race
that
with
different
standards
and
ideals
lived
so
mysteriously
in
and
among
their
adult
selves
nothing
was
said
about
the
strange
disappearance
of
bert
benbow
but
each
woman
had
it
in
mind
and
coupled
it
with
hilda
s
sudden
apprehension
concerning
george
and
imagined
weird
connections
between
the
one
and
the
other
and
felt
forebodings
about
children
nearer
to
her
own
heart
children
dominated
the
assemblage
and
made
restless
the
assemblage
collectively
felt
that
the
moment
for
separation
approached
the
at
home
was
practically
over
hilda
rang
the
bell
and
as
she
did
so
johnnie
orgreave
winked
dangerously
at
edwin
who
with
sternness
responded
he
wondered
why
he
should
thus
deceive
his
wife
with
whom
he
was
so
deliciously
intimate
he
thought
also
that
women
were
capricious
in
their
anxieties
and
yet
now
and
then
their
moods
once
more
by
the
favour
of
hazard
displayed
a
marvellous
appositeness
hilda
had
no
reason
whatever
for
worrying
more
about
george
on
this
night
than
on
any
other
night
nevertheless
this
night
happened
to
be
the
night
on
which
anxiety
would
be
justified
ada
said
hilda
to
the
entering
servant
have
you
seen
master
george
no
m
ada
replied
almost
defiantly
when
did
you
see
him
last
i
don
t
remember
m
m
is
he
in
bed
i
don
t
know
m
m
just
go
and
see
will
you
yes
m
the
company
waited
with
gentle
concealed
excitement
for
the
returning
ada
who
announced
his
bedroom
door
s
locked
m
m
he
will
lock
it
sometimes
although
i
ve
positively
forbidden
him
to
but
what
are
you
to
do
said
hilda
smilingly
to
the
other
mothers
take
the
key
away
obviously
tertius
ingpen
answered
the
question
turning
quickly
and
interrupting
his
chat
with
janet
orgreave
that
ought
not
to
be
necessary
said
fearns
as
an
expert
father
ada
departed
thankful
to
be
finished
with
the
ordeal
of
in
a
full
don
t
you
know
anything
about
him
hilda
addressed
johnnie
orgreave
suddenly
me
about
your
precious
no
why
should
i
know
because
you
re
getting
such
friends
you
two
oh
are
we
johnnie
said
carelessly
nevertheless
he
was
flattered
by
a
certain
nascent
admiration
on
the
part
of
george
which
was
then
beginning
to
be
noticeable
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
when
several
guests
had
gone
hilda
murmured
to
edwin
i
m
not
easy
about
that
boy
i
ll
just
run
upstairs
i
shouldn
t
said
edwin
but
she
did
and
the
distant
sound
of
knocking
and
george
george
could
be
heard
even
down
in
the
hall
i
can
t
wake
him
said
hilda
back
in
the
what
do
you
want
to
wake
him
for
foolish
girl
edwin
demanded
she
enjoyed
being
called
foolish
girl
but
she
was
not
to
be
tranquillised
do
you
think
he
is
in
bed
she
questioned
before
the
whole
remaining
company
and
the
dread
suspicion
was
out
after
more
journeys
upstairs
and
more
bangings
and
essays
with
keys
and
even
attempts
at
hilda
announced
that
george
s
room
must
be
besieged
from
its
window
a
ladder
was
found
and
interested
visitors
went
into
the
by
the
kitchen
to
see
it
reared
and
hear
the
result
edwin
thought
that
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
looked
as
guilty
as
he
himself
felt
though
she
more
than
once
asseverated
her
belief
that
master
george
was
safely
in
bed
the
ladder
was
too
short
edwin
mounted
it
and
tried
to
prise
himself
on
to
the
but
could
not
here
let
me
try
said
ingpen
joyous
ingpen
easily
succeeded
he
glanced
through
the
open
window
into
george
s
bedroom
and
then
looked
down
at
the
upturned
faces
and
ada
s
apron
whitely
visible
in
the
gloom
he
s
here
all
right
oh
good
said
hilda
is
he
asleep
yes
he
deserves
to
be
wakened
she
laughed
you
see
what
a
foolish
girl
you
ve
been
said
edwin
affectionately
never
mind
she
retorted
couldn
t
get
on
the
window
and
you
were
just
as
upset
as
anybody
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
thank
you
mr
ingpen
is
he
really
there
edwin
whispered
to
ingpen
as
soon
as
he
could
yes
and
asleep
too
i
wonder
how
the
deuce
he
slipped
in
i
ll
bet
anything
those
servants
have
been
telling
a
lot
of
lies
for
him
he
pulls
their
hair
down
and
simply
does
what
he
likes
with
them
edwin
was
now
greatly
reassured
but
he
could
not
quite
recover
from
the
glimpse
he
had
had
of
george
s
capacity
for
leading
a
double
life
sardonically
he
speculated
whether
the
heavenly
penknife
would
be
brought
to
his
notice
by
its
owner
and
if
so
by
what
ingenious
method
iii
the
final
sensation
was
caused
by
the
arrival
in
a
nearly
empty
of
plump
maggie
nervous
constrained
and
somewhat
breathless
bert
has
turned
up
she
said
clara
thought
i
d
better
come
along
and
tell
you
she
felt
sure
you
d
like
to
know
well
that
s
all
right
then
hilda
replied
perfunctorily
indicating
that
clara
s
conceited
assumption
of
a
universal
interest
in
her
dull
children
was
ridiculous
edwin
asked
did
the
kid
say
where
he
d
been
been
running
about
the
streets
they
don
t
know
what
s
come
over
him
because
you
see
he
d
actually
gone
to
bed
once
albert
is
quite
puzzled
but
he
says
he
ll
have
it
out
of
him
before
he
s
done
when
he
does
get
it
out
of
him
thought
edwin
again
there
will
be
a
family
row
and
george
will
be
indicted
as
the
corrupter
of
innocence
maggie
would
not
stay
a
single
moment
hilda
attentively
accompanied
her
to
the
hall
the
former
and
the
present
mistress
of
the
house
kissed
with
the
conventional
signs
of
affection
but
the
fact
that
one
had
succeeded
the
other
seemed
to
divide
them
hilda
was
always
lying
in
wait
for
criticism
from
maggie
ready
to
resent
it
maggie
divined
this
and
said
never
a
word
the
silence
piqued
hilda
as
much
as
outspoken
criticism
would
have
annoyed
her
she
could
not
bear
it
how
do
you
like
my
new
she
demanded
defiantly
very
nice
very
nice
i
m
sure
maggie
replied
without
conviction
and
added
just
as
she
stepped
outside
the
you
ve
made
a
lot
of
changes
this
was
the
mild
girl
s
sole
thrust
and
it
was
as
effective
as
she
could
have
wished
everybody
had
gone
except
the
two
orgreaves
and
tertius
ingpen
i
don
t
know
about
you
johnnie
but
i
must
go
said
janet
orgreave
when
hilda
came
back
hold
on
jan
johnnie
protested
you
re
forgetting
those
duets
you
are
to
try
with
ingpen
really
duets
cried
hilda
instantly
uplifted
and
enthusiastic
oh
do
let
s
have
some
music
ingpen
by
arrangement
with
the
orgreaves
had
brought
some
pianoforte
duets
they
were
tied
to
his
bicycle
he
was
known
as
an
amateur
of
music
edwin
bidding
ingpen
not
to
move
ran
out
into
the
garden
to
get
the
music
from
the
bicycle
johnnie
ran
after
him
through
the
french
window
i
say
johnnie
called
in
a
low
voice
what
s
up
edwin
stopped
for
him
i
ve
a
piece
of
news
for
you
about
that
land
you
ve
set
your
heart
on
down
at
shawport
it
can
be
bought
cheap
at
least
the
old
man
says
it
s
cheap
whatever
his
opinion
may
be
worth
i
was
telling
him
about
your
scheme
for
having
a
new
printing
works
altogether
astonishing
how
keen
he
is
if
i
d
had
a
plan
of
the
land
i
believe
he
d
have
sat
down
and
made
sketches
at
once
johnnie
with
his
brother
jimmie
was
in
partnership
with
old
orgreave
as
an
architect
set
my
heart
on
edwin
mumbled
intimidated
as
usual
by
a
nearer
view
of
an
enterprise
which
he
had
himself
conceived
and
which
had
enchanted
him
from
afar
set
my
heart
on
well
had
you
or
hadn
t
you
i
suppose
i
had
edwin
admitted
look
here
i
ll
drop
in
and
see
you
morning
right
together
they
detached
the
music
from
the
bicycle
and
as
edwin
unrolled
it
and
rolled
it
the
other
side
out
to
flatten
it
they
returned
silently
through
the
dark
garden
into
the
there
were
now
the
two
orgreaves
tertius
ingpen
and
hilda
and
edwin
in
the
we
will
now
begin
the
evening
said
ingpen
as
he
glanced
at
the
music
all
five
were
conscious
of
the
pleasant
feeling
of
freedom
intimacy
and
mutual
comprehension
which
animates
a
small
company
that
by
has
survived
out
of
a
larger
one
the
lateness
of
the
hour
aided
their
zest
even
the
more
staid
among
them
perceived
as
by
a
revelation
that
it
did
not
in
fact
matter
once
in
a
way
if
they
were
tired
and
inefficient
on
the
morrow
and
that
too
much
regularity
of
habit
was
bad
for
the
soul
edwin
had
brought
in
a
tray
from
the
and
rearranged
the
chairs
according
to
hilda
s
caprice
and
was
providing
cushions
to
raise
the
bodies
of
the
to
the
proper
height
janet
began
to
excuse
herself
asserting
that
if
there
was
one
member
of
her
family
who
could
not
play
duets
she
was
that
member
that
she
had
never
seen
this
dvorak
music
before
and
that
if
they
had
got
her
brother
tom
or
her
elder
sister
marion
or
even
alicia
etc
we
are
quite
accustomed
to
these
formal
preliminaries
from
miss
orgreave
said
ingpen
i
never
do
them
myself
not
because
i
can
play
well
but
because
i
am
hardened
now
shall
we
start
will
you
take
the
treble
or
the
bass
janet
answered
with
eager
modesty
that
she
would
take
the
bass
it
s
all
one
to
me
said
ingpen
putting
on
spectacles
i
play
either
equally
badly
you
ll
soon
regret
leaving
the
most
important
part
to
me
however
clayhanger
will
you
turn
over
er
yes
said
edwin
boldly
but
you
d
better
give
me
the
tip
he
knew
a
little
about
printed
music
from
his
experiences
as
a
boy
when
his
sisters
used
to
sing
songs
that
is
to
say
he
had
a
vague
idea
where
a
player
was
on
a
page
but
the
enterprise
of
turning
over
dvorak
s
legends
seemed
to
him
critically
adventurous
dvorak
was
nothing
but
a
name
to
him
beyond
the
correct
english
method
of
pronouncing
that
name
he
had
no
knowledge
whatever
of
the
subject
in
hand
then
the
performance
of
the
legends
began
despite
halts
hesitations
occasional
loud
insistent
chanting
of
the
time
explanations
between
the
players
many
wrong
notes
by
ingpen
and
a
few
wrong
notes
by
janet
and
one
or
two
enormous
misapprehensions
by
edwin
the
performance
was
a
success
in
that
it
put
a
spell
on
its
public
and
permitted
the
loose
and
tender
genius
of
dvorak
to
dominate
the
room
play
that
again
will
you
said
hilda
in
a
low
dramatic
voice
at
the
third
legend
we
will
ingpen
answered
and
we
ll
play
it
better
edwin
had
the
exquisite
sensation
of
partially
comprehending
music
whose
total
beauty
was
beyond
the
limitations
of
his
power
to
enjoy
power
nevertheless
which
seemed
to
grow
each
moment
passages
entirely
intelligible
and
lovely
would
break
at
intervals
through
the
veils
of
general
sound
and
ravish
him
all
his
attention
was
intensely
concentrated
on
the
page
he
could
hear
ingpen
breathing
hard
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
was
aware
of
johnnie
orgreave
on
the
sofa
making
signs
to
hilda
about
drinks
and
pouring
out
something
for
her
and
something
for
himself
without
the
faintest
noise
and
he
was
aware
of
ada
coming
to
the
open
door
and
being
waved
away
to
bed
by
her
mistress
well
he
said
when
the
last
legend
was
played
that
s
a
bit
of
the
right
sort
no
mistake
he
was
obliged
to
be
banal
and
colloquial
hilda
said
nothing
at
all
johnnie
who
had
waited
for
the
end
in
order
to
strike
a
match
showed
by
two
words
that
he
was
an
expert
listener
to
duets
tertius
ingpen
was
very
excited
and
pleased
more
tricky
than
difficult
isn
t
it
to
read
he
said
privately
to
his
who
concurred
janet
also
was
excited
in
her
fashion
but
even
amid
the
general
excitement
ingpen
had
to
be
judicious
delightful
stuff
of
course
he
said
pulling
his
beard
but
he
s
not
a
great
composer
you
know
all
the
same
he
ll
do
to
be
going
on
with
johnnie
murmured
oh
yes
delightful
delightful
ingpen
repeated
warmly
removing
his
spectacles
what
a
pity
we
can
t
have
musical
evenings
regularly
but
we
can
said
hilda
positively
let
s
have
them
here
every
week
a
great
scheme
edwin
agreed
with
enthusiasm
admiring
his
wife
s
initiative
he
had
been
a
little
afraid
that
the
episode
of
george
had
upset
her
for
the
night
but
he
now
saw
that
she
had
perfectly
recovered
from
it
oh
ingpen
paused
i
doubt
if
i
could
come
every
week
i
could
come
once
a
fortnight
well
once
a
fortnight
then
said
hilda
i
suppose
sunday
wouldn
t
suit
you
edwin
challenged
him
almost
fiercely
why
won
t
it
suit
us
it
will
suit
us
ingpen
merely
said
with
quiet
delicacy
so
much
the
better
we
might
go
all
through
the
mozart
fiddle
sonatas
and
who
s
your
violinist
asked
johnnie
i
am
if
you
don
t
mind
ingpen
smiled
if
your
sister
will
take
the
piano
part
hilda
exclaimed
admiringly
do
you
play
the
violin
too
mr
ingpen
i
scrape
it
also
the
tenor
but
my
real
instrument
is
the
clarinet
he
laughed
it
seems
odd
he
went
on
with
genuine
scientific
unegotistic
interest
in
himself
but
d
you
know
i
thoroughly
enjoy
playing
the
clarinet
in
a
bad
orchestra
whenever
i
get
the
chance
when
i
happen
to
have
a
free
evening
i
often
wish
i
could
drop
in
at
a
theatre
and
play
rotten
music
in
the
band
it
s
better
than
nothing
some
of
us
are
born
mad
but
ingpen
said
janet
orgreave
anxiously
after
this
speech
had
been
appreciated
i
have
never
played
those
mozart
sonatas
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
replied
with
admirable
tranquillity
neither
have
i
ve
often
meant
to
it
ll
be
quite
a
sporting
event
but
of
course
we
can
have
a
rehearsal
if
you
like
the
project
of
the
musical
evenings
was
discussed
and
discussed
until
janet
having
vanished
silently
upstairs
reappeared
with
her
hat
and
cloak
on
i
can
go
alone
if
you
aren
t
ready
johnnie
said
she
johnnie
yawned
no
i
m
coming
i
also
must
go
i
suppose
said
ingpen
they
all
went
into
the
hall
through
the
open
door
of
the
where
one
burned
could
be
seen
the
rich
remains
of
what
had
been
light
refreshments
in
the
most
generous
interpretation
of
the
term
ingpen
stopped
to
regard
the
spectacle
fingering
his
beard
i
was
just
wondering
he
remarked
with
that
strange
eternal
curiosity
about
himself
whether
i
d
had
enough
to
eat
i
ve
got
to
ride
home
well
what
have
you
had
johnnie
quizzed
him
i
haven
t
had
anything
said
ingpen
except
drink
hilda
cried
oh
you
poor
sufferer
i
am
ashamed
and
led
him
familiarly
to
the
table
iv
edwin
was
kept
at
the
some
time
by
johnnie
orgreave
who
resumed
as
he
was
departing
the
subject
of
the
proposed
new
works
and
maintained
it
at
such
length
that
janet
tired
of
waiting
on
the
pavement
said
that
she
would
walk
on
when
he
returned
to
the
ingpen
and
hilda
were
sitting
side
by
side
at
the
littered
table
and
the
first
words
that
edwin
heard
were
from
ingpen
it
cost
me
a
penknife
but
it
was
dirt
cheap
at
the
price
you
can
t
expect
to
be
the
almighty
for
much
less
than
a
penknife
seeing
edwin
he
added
with
a
nonchalant
smile
i
ve
told
clayhanger
all
about
the
answer
to
prayer
i
thought
she
ought
to
know
edwin
laughed
awkwardly
saying
to
himself
ingpen
my
boy
you
ought
to
have
thought
of
my
position
first
you
ve
been
putting
your
finger
into
a
rather
delicate
piece
of
mechanism
supposing
she
cuts
up
rough
with
me
afterwards
for
hiding
it
from
her
all
this
time
i
m
living
with
her
you
aren
t
of
course
ingpen
added
i
ve
sworn
the
lady
to
secrecy
hilda
said
i
knew
all
the
time
there
was
something
wrong
and
edwin
thought
no
you
didn
t
and
if
he
hadn
t
happened
to
tell
you
about
the
thing
you
d
have
been
convinced
that
you
d
been
alarming
yourself
for
nothing
but
he
only
said
not
certain
of
hilda
s
humour
and
anxious
to
placate
her
there
s
no
doubt
george
ought
to
be
punished
nothing
of
the
kind
nothing
of
the
kind
ingpen
vivaciously
protested
why
bless
my
soul
the
kids
were
engaged
in
a
religious
work
they
were
busy
with
someone
far
more
important
than
any
parents
and
after
a
pause
reflectively
curious
thing
the
mentality
of
a
child
i
doubt
if
we
understand
anything
about
it
hilda
smiled
but
said
naught
may
i
enquire
what
there
is
in
that
bottle
ingpen
asked
benedictine
have
some
mr
ingpen
i
will
if
you
will
mrs
clayhanger
edwin
raised
his
eyebrows
at
his
wife
you
needn
t
look
at
me
said
hilda
i
m
going
to
have
some
ingpen
smacked
his
lips
over
the
liqueur
it
s
a
very
bad
thing
late
at
night
of
course
but
i
believe
in
giving
your
stomach
something
to
think
about
i
never
allow
my
digestive
apparatus
to
boss
me
quite
right
mr
ingpen
they
touched
glasses
without
a
word
almost
instinctively
well
thought
edwin
for
a
chap
who
thinks
women
ought
to
be
behind
the
veil
be
a
man
clayhanger
and
have
some
edwin
shook
his
head
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
movement
of
her
glass
hilda
greeted
her
husband
peeping
out
at
him
as
it
were
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
in
a
glint
of
affection
he
was
quite
happy
they
were
all
seated
close
together
edwin
opposite
the
other
two
at
the
large
table
the
single
by
the
very
inadequacy
with
which
it
lighted
the
scene
of
disorder
produced
an
effect
of
informal
homeliness
and
fellowship
that
warmed
the
heart
each
of
the
three
realised
with
pleasure
that
a
new
and
promising
friendship
was
in
the
making
they
talked
at
length
about
the
musical
evenings
and
edwin
said
that
he
should
buy
some
music
and
hilda
asked
him
to
obtain
a
history
of
music
that
ingpen
described
with
some
enthusiasm
and
the
date
of
the
first
evening
was
settled
sunday
week
and
after
uncounted
minutes
ingpen
remarked
that
he
presumed
he
had
better
go
i
have
to
cycle
home
he
announced
once
more
hilda
exclaimed
no
this
morning
all
the
way
to
axe
oh
no
i
m
three
miles
this
side
of
axe
it
s
only
six
and
a
half
miles
but
all
those
hills
pooh
excellent
for
the
muscles
of
the
calf
do
you
live
alone
mr
ingpen
i
have
a
sort
of
housekeeper
in
a
cottage
in
a
cottage
but
what
do
you
all
alone
i
cultivate
myself
and
hilda
in
a
changed
tone
said
how
wise
you
are
rather
inconvenient
being
out
there
isn
t
it
edwin
suggested
it
may
be
inconvenient
sometimes
for
my
job
but
i
can
t
help
that
i
give
the
state
what
i
consider
fair
value
for
the
money
it
pays
me
and
not
a
grain
more
i
ve
got
myself
to
think
about
there
are
some
things
i
won
t
do
and
one
of
them
is
to
live
all
the
time
in
a
vile
hole
like
the
five
towns
i
won
t
do
it
i
d
sooner
be
a
blooming
peasant
on
the
land
as
he
was
a
native
he
had
the
right
to
criticise
the
district
without
protest
from
other
natives
you
re
quite
right
as
to
the
vile
hole
said
hilda
with
conviction
i
don
t
know
edwin
muttered
i
think
old
bosley
isn
t
so
bad
yes
but
you
re
an
old
dearest
said
hilda
ingpen
has
lived
away
from
the
district
and
so
have
i
you
haven
t
you
re
no
judge
we
know
don
t
we
mr
ingpen
when
ingpen
having
at
last
accumulated
sufficient
resolution
to
move
and
get
his
cap
they
went
through
the
to
the
garden
they
found
that
rain
was
falling
never
mind
said
ingpen
lifting
his
head
sardonically
in
a
mute
indictment
of
the
heavens
i
have
my
mack
edwin
searched
out
the
bicycle
and
brought
it
to
the
window
and
hilda
stuck
a
hat
on
his
head
leisurely
ingpen
clipped
his
trousers
at
the
ankle
and
unstrapped
a
mackintosh
cape
from
the
machine
and
folded
the
strap
leisurely
he
put
on
the
cape
and
gazed
at
the
impenetrable
heavens
again
i
can
make
you
up
a
bed
mr
ingpen
no
thanks
oh
no
thanks
the
fact
is
i
rather
like
rain
leisurely
he
took
a
box
of
fusees
from
his
pocket
and
lighted
his
lamp
examining
it
as
though
it
contained
some
hidden
and
perilous
defect
then
he
pressed
the
tyres
the
back
tyre
ll
do
with
a
little
more
air
he
said
thoughtfully
i
don
t
know
if
my
pump
will
work
it
did
work
but
slowly
after
which
gloves
had
to
be
assumed
i
suppose
i
can
get
out
this
way
oh
my
music
never
mind
i
ll
leave
it
then
with
a
sudden
access
of
ceremoniousness
he
bade
adieu
to
hilda
no
detail
of
punctilio
was
omitted
from
the
formality
many
thanks
thank
edwin
preceded
the
bicyclist
and
the
bicycle
round
the
side
of
the
house
to
the
at
the
corner
of
hulton
street
and
trafalgar
road
in
the
solemn
and
chill
nocturnal
solitude
of
hulton
street
ingpen
straddled
the
bicycle
with
his
left
foot
on
one
raised
pedal
and
the
other
on
the
pavement
and
then
held
out
a
gloved
hand
to
edwin
old
chap
see
you
soon
much
and
appreciation
and
hope
was
implicit
in
that
rather
casual
handshake
he
sheered
off
strongly
down
the
dark
slope
of
hulton
street
in
the
rain
using
his
ankles
with
skill
in
the
the
man
s
calves
seemed
to
be
enormously
developed
the
cape
ballooned
out
behind
his
swiftness
and
in
a
moment
he
had
swerved
round
the
flickering
mournful
at
the
bottom
of
the
mean
new
street
and
was
gone
chapter
vi
husband
and
wife
i
i
m
upstairs
hilda
called
in
a
powerful
whisper
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
as
soon
as
edwin
had
closed
and
bolted
the
he
responded
humorously
he
felt
very
happy
lusty
and
wideawake
the
evening
had
had
its
contretemps
its
varying
curve
of
success
but
as
a
whole
it
was
a
triumph
and
above
all
it
was
over
a
thing
that
had
had
to
be
accomplished
and
that
had
been
accomplished
with
dignity
and
effectiveness
he
walked
in
ease
from
room
to
lighted
empty
room
and
the
splendid
waste
of
gas
pleased
him
arousing
something
royal
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
generous
natures
in
the
especially
the
gas
had
been
flaring
to
no
purpose
for
hours
room
her
very
own
room
he
wondered
indulgently
when
if
ever
she
would
really
make
it
her
own
room
by
impressing
her
individuality
upon
it
he
knew
she
was
always
meaning
to
do
something
drastic
to
the
room
but
so
far
she
had
got
no
further
than
his
portrait
child
infant
wayward
girl
still
the
fact
of
the
portrait
on
the
mantelpiece
touched
him
he
dwelt
tenderly
on
the
invisible
image
of
the
woman
upstairs
it
was
marvellous
how
she
was
not
the
hilda
he
had
married
the
new
hilda
had
so
overlaid
and
hidden
the
old
that
he
had
positively
to
make
an
effort
to
recall
what
the
old
one
was
with
her
sternness
and
her
anxious
air
of
responsibility
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
the
old
hilda
too
he
desired
to
be
splendidly
generous
to
environ
her
with
all
luxuries
to
lift
her
clear
above
other
women
he
desired
the
means
to
be
senselessly
extravagant
for
her
to
clasp
on
her
arm
a
bracelet
whose
cost
would
keep
a
workingman
s
family
for
three
years
would
have
delighted
him
and
though
he
was
interested
in
social
schemes
and
had
a
social
conscience
he
would
sooner
have
bought
that
bracelet
and
so
purchased
the
momentary
thrill
of
putting
it
on
her
capricious
arm
than
have
helped
to
ameliorate
the
lot
of
thousands
of
victimised
human
beings
he
had
hilda
in
his
bones
and
he
knew
it
and
he
knew
that
it
was
a
grand
and
a
painful
thing
nevertheless
he
was
not
without
a
considerable
for
he
had
done
very
well
by
hilda
he
had
found
her
at
the
mercy
of
the
world
and
now
she
was
safe
and
sheltered
and
beloved
and
made
mistress
of
a
house
and
home
that
would
stand
comparison
with
most
houses
and
homes
he
was
proud
of
his
house
he
always
watched
over
it
he
was
always
improving
it
and
he
would
improve
it
more
and
more
and
it
should
never
be
quite
finished
the
disorder
in
it
now
irked
him
he
walked
to
and
fro
and
restored
every
piece
of
furniture
to
its
proper
place
heaped
the
contents
of
the
into
one
large
covered
some
of
the
food
and
locked
up
the
alcohol
he
did
this
leisurely
while
thinking
of
the
woman
upstairs
and
while
eating
two
chocolates
not
more
because
he
had
notions
about
his
stomach
then
he
shut
and
bolted
the
window
and
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
cellar
steps
and
sniffed
so
as
to
be
quite
certain
that
the
radiator
furnace
was
not
setting
the
house
on
fire
and
then
he
extinguished
the
lights
and
the
last
of
all
and
his
sole
illumination
was
the
gas
on
the
landing
inviting
him
upstairs
standing
on
the
dark
stairs
on
his
way
to
bed
eager
and
yet
reluctant
to
mount
he
realised
the
entity
of
the
house
he
thought
of
the
astounding
and
mysterious
george
and
of
those
uncomprehended
beings
ada
and
the
cook
in
their
attic
sleeping
by
the
side
of
the
portrait
of
a
fireman
in
uniform
he
felt
sure
that
one
or
both
of
them
had
been
privy
to
george
s
unlawful
adventures
and
he
heartily
liked
them
for
shielding
the
boy
and
he
thought
of
his
wife
moving
about
in
the
bedroom
upon
which
she
impressed
her
individuality
he
went
upstairs
yes
he
should
proceed
with
the
enterprise
of
the
new
works
he
had
the
courage
for
it
now
he
was
rich
according
to
bursley
ideas
he
would
be
far
richer
he
gave
a
faint
laugh
at
the
memory
of
george
s
objection
to
bert
s
choice
of
a
bicycle
as
a
gift
from
heaven
ii
hilda
was
brushing
her
hair
the
bedroom
seemed
to
be
full
of
her
and
the
disorder
of
her
multitudinous
things
whenever
he
asked
why
a
particular
item
of
her
goods
was
in
a
particular
spot
the
spot
appearing
to
him
to
have
been
bizarrely
chosen
she
always
proved
to
her
own
satisfaction
by
a
quite
improvised
argument
that
that
particular
spot
was
the
sole
possible
spot
for
that
particular
item
the
bedroom
was
no
longer
theirs
it
was
hers
he
picnicked
in
it
he
didn
t
mind
in
fact
he
rather
liked
the
picnic
it
pleased
him
to
exercise
his
talent
for
order
and
organisation
so
as
to
maintain
his
own
comfort
in
the
small
spaces
which
she
left
to
him
the
room
was
in
a
divine
confusion
he
accepted
it
with
pleasure
the
beds
had
not
been
turned
down
because
it
was
improper
to
turn
them
down
when
they
were
to
be
used
for
the
deposit
of
strangers
finery
on
edwin
s
bed
now
lay
the
dress
which
hilda
had
taken
off
it
was
a
most
agreeable
object
on
the
bed
and
seemed
even
richer
and
more
complex
there
than
on
hilda
he
removed
it
carefully
to
a
chair
an
antique
diaphanous
shawl
remained
which
was
unfamiliar
to
him
what
s
this
shawl
he
asked
i
ve
never
seen
this
shawl
before
what
is
it
hilda
was
busy
her
bent
head
buried
in
hair
oh
edwin
what
an
old
fusser
you
are
she
mumbled
what
shawl
he
held
it
up
someone
must
have
left
it
he
proceeded
with
the
turning
down
of
his
bed
then
he
sat
on
a
chair
to
regard
hilda
when
she
had
done
her
hair
she
padded
across
the
room
and
examined
the
shawl
what
a
precious
thing
she
exclaimed
it
s
fearns
s
she
must
have
taken
it
off
to
put
her
jacket
on
and
then
forgotten
it
but
i
d
no
idea
how
good
it
was
it
s
genuine
old
i
wonder
how
it
would
suit
me
she
put
it
round
her
shoulders
and
then
stood
smiling
posing
bold
provocative
for
his
verdict
the
whiteness
of
her
deshabille
showed
through
the
delicate
pattern
and
tints
of
the
shawl
with
a
strange
effect
for
him
she
was
more
than
a
woman
she
was
the
incarnation
of
a
sex
it
was
marvellous
how
all
she
did
all
her
ideas
and
her
gestures
were
so
intensely
feminine
so
sure
to
perturb
or
enchant
him
nervously
he
began
to
wind
his
watch
he
wanted
to
spring
up
and
kiss
her
because
she
was
herself
but
he
could
not
so
he
said
come
here
chit
let
me
look
at
that
shawl
she
obeyed
she
knelt
acquiescent
he
put
his
watch
back
into
his
pocket
and
fingered
the
shawl
then
she
said
i
suppose
one
ll
be
allowed
to
grumble
at
georgie
for
locking
his
bedroom
door
and
she
said
it
with
a
touch
of
mockery
in
her
clear
precise
voice
as
though
twitting
him
and
ingpen
too
about
their
absurd
theoretical
sense
of
honour
towards
children
and
there
was
a
touch
of
fine
bitterness
in
her
voice
also
a
reminiscence
of
the
old
hilda
incalculable
creature
who
could
have
guessed
that
she
would
make
such
a
remark
at
such
a
moment
in
his
mind
he
dashed
george
to
pieces
but
as
a
wise
male
he
ignored
all
her
implications
and
answered
casually
mildly
with
an
affirmative
she
went
on
what
were
you
talking
such
a
long
time
to
johnnie
orgreave
about
talking
a
long
time
to
johnnie
orgreave
oh
d
you
mean
at
the
why
it
wasn
t
half
a
minute
he
happened
to
mention
a
piece
of
land
down
at
shawport
that
i
had
a
sort
of
a
notion
of
buying
buying
what
for
her
tone
hardened
well
supposing
i
had
to
build
a
new
works
you
never
told
me
anything
about
it
i
ve
only
just
begun
to
think
of
it
myself
you
see
if
i
m
to
go
in
for
lithography
as
it
ought
to
be
gone
in
for
i
can
t
possibly
stay
at
the
shop
i
must
have
more
room
and
a
lot
more
and
it
would
be
cheaper
to
build
than
to
rent
she
stood
up
why
go
in
more
for
lithography
you
can
t
stand
still
in
business
must
either
go
forward
or
go
back
it
seems
to
me
it
s
very
risky
i
wondered
what
you
were
hiding
from
me
my
dear
girl
i
was
not
hiding
anything
from
you
he
protested
whose
land
is
it
it
belongs
to
tobias
hall
s
estate
yes
and
i
ve
no
doubt
the
halls
would
be
very
glad
to
get
rid
of
it
who
told
you
about
it
johnnie
of
course
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
him
too
but
i
d
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
any
land
going
cheap
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
shrugged
away
the
disinterestedness
of
all
orgreaves
anyone
could
get
the
better
of
you
she
said
he
resented
this
estimate
of
himself
as
a
simpleton
he
assuredly
did
not
want
to
quarrel
but
he
was
obliged
to
say
oh
could
they
an
acerbity
scarcely
intentional
somehow
entered
into
his
tone
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
he
recognised
the
tone
as
the
forerunner
of
altercations
of
course
she
insisted
superiorly
and
then
went
on
we
re
all
right
as
we
are
we
spend
too
much
money
but
i
daresay
we
re
all
right
if
you
go
in
for
a
lot
of
new
things
you
may
lose
all
we
ve
got
and
then
where
shall
we
be
in
his
heart
he
said
to
her
what
s
it
got
to
do
with
you
you
manage
your
home
and
i
ll
manage
my
business
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
business
you
re
the
very
antithesis
of
business
whatever
business
you
ve
ever
had
to
do
with
you
ve
ruined
you
ve
no
right
to
judge
and
no
grounds
for
judgment
it
s
odious
of
you
to
asperse
any
of
the
orgreaves
they
were
always
your
best
friends
i
should
never
have
met
you
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
them
and
where
would
you
be
now
without
me
trying
to
run
some
wretched
and
probably
starving
why
do
you
assume
that
i
m
a
d
d
fool
you
always
do
let
me
tell
you
that
i
m
one
of
the
most
men
in
this
town
and
everybody
knows
it
except
you
anyhow
i
was
clever
enough
to
get
out
of
a
mess
you
knew
i
was
hiding
something
from
you
did
you
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
talk
such
infernal
rot
and
moreover
i
won
t
have
you
interfering
in
my
business
other
wives
don
t
and
you
shan
t
so
let
that
be
clearly
understood
in
his
heart
he
was
very
and
very
savage
but
he
only
said
well
we
shall
see
she
retorted
naturally
if
you
ve
made
up
your
mind
there
s
no
more
to
be
said
he
broke
out
viciously
i
ve
not
made
up
my
mind
don
t
i
tell
you
i
ve
only
just
begun
to
think
about
it
he
was
angry
and
now
that
he
actually
was
angry
he
took
an
almost
sensual
pleasure
in
being
angry
he
had
been
angry
before
though
on
a
smaller
scale
with
less
provocation
and
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
never
be
angry
again
but
now
that
he
was
angry
again
he
gloomily
and
fiercely
revelled
in
it
hilda
silently
folded
up
the
shawl
and
putting
it
into
a
drawer
of
the
wardrobe
shut
the
drawer
with
an
irritatingly
gentle
click
click
he
could
have
killed
her
for
that
click
she
seized
a
i
must
just
go
and
look
at
george
she
murmured
with
cool
clear
calmness
the
virtuous
anxious
mother
not
a
trace
of
coquetry
anywhere
in
her
what
bosh
he
thought
she
knows
perfectly
well
george
s
door
is
bolted
marriage
was
a
startling
affair
who
could
have
foretold
this
finish
to
the
evening
nothing
had
occurred
nothing
and
yet
everything
his
plans
were
all
awry
he
could
see
naught
but
trouble
she
was
away
some
time
when
she
returned
he
was
in
bed
with
his
face
averted
he
heard
her
moving
about
will
she
or
won
t
she
come
and
kiss
me
he
thought
she
came
and
kissed
him
but
it
was
a
meaningless
kiss
she
said
aloofly
night
she
slept
but
he
could
not
sleep
he
kept
thinking
the
same
thought
she
s
no
right
whatever
i
must
say
i
never
bargained
for
this
etc
chapter
vii
the
truce
i
nearly
a
week
passed
hilda
in
the
leisure
of
a
woman
of
fashion
after
dinner
was
at
the
piano
in
the
she
had
not
urgent
stockings
to
mend
nor
jam
to
make
nor
careless
wenches
to
overlook
nor
food
to
buy
nor
accounts
to
keep
nor
a
new
dress
to
scheme
out
of
an
old
one
nor
to
perform
her
duty
to
her
neighbour
she
had
nothing
to
do
like
edwin
she
could
not
play
the
piano
but
she
had
picked
up
a
note
here
and
a
note
there
in
the
course
of
her
life
and
with
much
labour
and
many
slow
hesitations
she
could
puzzle
out
a
chord
or
a
melody
from
the
printed
page
she
was
now
exasperatingly
spelling
with
her
finger
a
fragment
of
melody
from
one
of
dvorak
s
legends
a
fragment
that
had
inhabited
her
mind
since
she
first
heard
it
and
that
seemed
to
gather
up
and
state
all
the
sweet
intolerable
melancholy
implicit
in
the
romantic
existence
of
that
city
on
the
map
prague
on
the
previous
day
she
had
been
a
quarter
of
an
hour
identifying
the
unforgetable
indismissible
fragment
amid
the
multitude
of
notes
now
she
had
recognisably
pieced
its
phrases
together
and
as
her
stiff
finger
stumbled
through
it
her
ears
heard
it
once
more
and
she
could
not
repeat
it
often
enough
what
she
heard
was
not
what
she
was
playing
but
something
finer
her
souvenir
of
what
tertius
ingpen
had
played
and
something
finer
than
that
something
finer
than
the
greatest
artist
could
possibly
play
magic
it
was
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
to
her
that
she
had
been
able
to
reproduce
the
souvenir
in
physical
sound
she
was
proud
of
herself
as
a
and
somewhat
surprised
and
at
the
same
time
she
was
abject
because
she
could
not
play
the
piano
she
thought
that
she
would
be
ready
to
sacrifice
many
happinesses
in
order
to
be
able
to
play
as
well
as
even
george
played
that
she
would
exchange
all
her
own
gifts
multiplied
by
a
hundred
in
order
to
be
able
to
play
as
janet
orgreave
played
and
that
to
be
a
pianist
dominating
immense
audiences
in
european
capitals
must
mean
the
summit
of
rapture
and
glory
she
had
never
listened
to
a
pianist
meanwhile
without
the
ennui
and
slavery
of
practice
she
was
enchanting
herself
and
she
savoured
her
idleness
and
thought
of
her
young
pretty
servants
at
work
and
her
boy
loose
and
at
large
and
her
husband
keeping
her
and
of
the
intensity
of
beautiful
sorrow
palpitating
behind
the
mediæval
façades
of
prague
had
ingpen
overheard
her
he
might
have
demanded
who
is
making
that
infernal
noise
on
the
piano
edwin
came
into
the
room
holding
a
thick
green
book
he
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
back
at
the
works
or
shop
as
it
was
still
called
because
it
had
once
been
principally
a
shop
keeping
her
hello
she
murmured
without
glancing
away
from
the
piano
i
thought
you
were
gone
they
had
not
quarrelled
but
they
had
not
made
peace
and
the
open
question
of
lithography
and
the
new
works
still
separated
them
sometimes
they
had
approached
each
other
pretending
amiably
or
even
affectionately
that
there
was
no
open
question
but
the
reality
of
the
question
could
not
be
destroyed
by
any
pretence
of
ignoring
it
while
gazing
at
the
piano
hilda
could
also
see
edwin
she
thought
she
knew
him
but
she
was
always
making
discoveries
in
this
branch
of
knowledge
now
and
then
she
was
so
bewildered
by
discoveries
that
she
came
to
wonder
why
she
had
married
him
and
why
people
do
marry
really
the
fact
was
that
she
had
married
him
for
the
look
in
his
eyes
it
was
a
sad
look
and
beyond
that
it
could
not
be
described
also
a
little
she
had
married
him
for
his
bright
untidy
hair
and
for
that
short
oblique
shake
of
the
head
which
with
him
meant
a
greeting
or
an
affirmative
she
had
not
married
him
for
his
sentiments
nor
for
his
goodness
of
heart
some
points
in
him
she
did
not
like
he
had
a
tendency
to
colds
and
she
hated
him
whenever
he
had
a
cold
she
often
detested
his
terrible
tidiness
though
it
was
a
convenient
failing
more
and
more
she
herself
wilfully
enjoyed
being
untidy
as
her
mother
had
been
untidy
and
to
think
that
her
mother
s
untidiness
used
to
annoy
her
on
the
other
hand
she
found
pleasure
in
humouring
edwin
s
crotchettiness
in
regard
to
the
details
of
a
meal
she
did
not
like
his
way
of
walking
which
was
ungainly
nor
his
way
of
standing
which
was
infirm
she
preferred
him
to
be
seated
she
could
not
but
regret
his
irresolution
and
his
love
of
ease
however
the
look
in
his
eyes
was
paramount
because
she
was
in
love
with
him
she
knew
that
he
was
more
deeply
and
helplessly
in
love
with
her
than
she
with
him
but
even
she
was
perhaps
tightlier
bound
than
in
her
pride
she
thought
her
love
had
the
maladies
of
a
woman
s
love
when
it
is
great
these
may
possibly
be
also
the
maladies
of
a
man
s
love
it
could
be
bitter
certainly
it
could
never
rest
from
criticism
spoken
or
unspoken
in
the
presence
of
others
she
would
criticise
him
to
herself
if
not
aloud
nearly
all
the
time
the
ordeal
was
continuous
when
she
got
him
alone
she
would
often
endow
him
at
a
stroke
with
perfection
and
her
tenderness
would
pour
over
him
she
trusted
him
profoundly
and
yet
she
had
constant
misgivings
which
weakened
or
temporarily
destroyed
her
confidence
she
would
treat
a
statement
from
him
with
almost
hostile
caution
and
accept
blindly
the
very
same
statement
from
a
stranger
her
habit
was
to
assume
that
in
any
encounter
between
him
and
a
stranger
he
would
be
worsted
she
was
afraid
for
him
she
felt
that
she
could
protect
him
better
than
he
could
protect
himself
against
any
danger
whatever
this
instinct
to
protect
him
was
also
the
instinct
of
for
peril
to
him
meant
peril
to
her
and
she
had
had
enough
of
peril
after
years
of
disastrous
peril
she
was
safe
and
george
was
safe
and
if
she
was
passionately
in
love
with
edwin
she
was
also
passionately
in
love
with
safety
she
had
breathed
a
long
sigh
of
relief
and
from
a
desperate
had
become
a
woman
she
lay
back
as
it
were
luxuriously
on
a
lounge
after
exhausting
and
horrible
exertions
she
had
scarcely
ceased
to
pant
at
the
least
sign
of
recurring
danger
all
her
nerves
were
on
the
hence
her
inimical
attitude
towards
the
project
of
the
new
works
and
the
extension
of
lithography
in
bursley
the
simpleton
a
moment
earlier
the
perfect
man
might
ruin
himself
and
her
in
her
view
he
was
the
last
person
to
undertake
such
an
enterprise
since
her
marriage
clara
maggie
and
auntie
hamps
had
been
engaged
in
the
pleasant
endless
task
of
telling
her
all
about
everything
that
related
to
the
family
and
she
had
been
permitted
to
understand
that
edwin
though
utterly
admirable
was
not
of
a
creative
disposition
and
that
he
had
done
nothing
but
conserve
what
his
father
had
left
without
his
father
edwin
would
have
been
in
a
very
different
position
she
believed
this
every
day
indeed
edwin
by
the
texture
of
his
hourly
life
proved
the
truth
of
it
all
the
persons
standing
to
make
a
profit
out
of
the
new
project
would
get
the
better
of
his
fine
ingenuous
temperament
naturally
she
knew
the
world
did
edwin
suppose
that
she
did
not
know
what
the
world
was
and
then
the
interminable
worry
of
the
new
enterprise
misgivings
uncertainties
extra
work
secret
preoccupations
what
room
for
love
what
hope
of
tranquillity
in
all
that
he
might
argue
but
she
did
not
want
to
argue
she
would
not
argue
she
was
dead
against
the
entire
project
he
had
not
said
to
her
that
it
was
no
affair
of
hers
but
she
knew
that
such
was
his
thought
and
she
resented
the
attitude
no
affair
of
hers
when
it
threatened
her
felicity
no
she
would
not
have
it
she
was
happy
and
secure
and
while
lying
luxuriously
back
in
her
lounge
she
would
maintain
all
the
defences
of
her
happiness
and
her
security
ii
holding
the
green
book
in
front
of
her
edwin
said
quietly
read
this
which
he
pointed
with
his
finger
she
read
think
i
could
turn
and
live
with
animals
they
are
so
placid
and
stand
and
look
at
them
long
and
do
not
sweat
and
whine
about
their
do
not
lie
awake
in
the
dark
and
weep
for
their
do
not
make
me
sick
discussing
their
duty
to
one
is
dissatisfied
not
one
is
demented
with
the
mania
of
owning
one
kneels
to
another
nor
to
his
kind
that
lived
thousands
of
years
one
is
respectable
or
unhappy
over
the
whole
edwin
had
lately
been
exciting
himself
not
for
the
first
time
over
walt
whitman
fine
isn
t
it
he
said
sure
that
she
would
share
his
thrill
magnificent
she
agreed
with
quiet
enthusiasm
i
must
read
more
of
that
she
gazed
over
the
top
of
the
book
through
the
open
window
into
the
garden
he
withdrew
the
book
and
closed
it
you
haven
t
got
that
tune
exactly
right
you
know
he
said
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
music
oh
she
was
startled
what
did
he
know
about
it
he
could
not
play
the
piano
where
are
you
he
asked
show
me
where
s
the
confounded
place
on
the
piano
well
at
the
end
you
play
it
like
this
he
imitated
her
whereas
it
ought
to
be
like
this
he
played
the
last
four
notes
differently
so
it
ought
she
murmured
with
submission
after
having
frowned
that
bit
of
a
tune
s
been
running
in
my
head
too
he
said
the
strange
beauty
of
whitman
and
the
strange
beauty
of
dvorak
seemed
to
unite
and
both
edwin
and
hilda
were
uplifted
not
merely
by
these
mingled
beauties
but
by
their
realisation
of
the
wondrous
fact
that
they
both
took
intense
pleasure
in
the
same
varied
forms
of
beauty
happiness
rose
about
them
like
a
sweet
smell
in
the
spaces
of
the
comfortable
impeccable
and
for
a
moment
they
leaned
towards
each
other
in
bliss
across
the
open
question
was
it
still
open
ah
edwin
might
be
ingenuous
a
simpleton
but
hilda
admitted
the
astounding
mystifying
adroitness
of
his
demeanour
had
he
abandoned
the
lithographic
project
or
was
he
privately
nursing
it
in
his
friendliness
towards
herself
was
there
a
reserve
or
was
there
not
she
knew
she
did
not
know
she
knew
yes
there
was
a
reserve
but
it
was
so
infinitesimal
that
she
could
not
define
it
could
not
decide
whether
it
was
due
to
obstinacy
of
purpose
or
merely
to
a
sense
of
injury
whether
it
was
resentful
or
condescending
exciting
times
and
she
perceived
that
her
new
life
was
gradually
getting
fuller
of
such
excitements
well
said
he
it
s
nearly
three
s
coming
along
i
d
better
be
off
down
and
earn
a
bit
towards
maggie
s
rent
before
the
june
he
had
been
jocular
in
the
same
way
about
maggie
s
rent
in
the
division
of
old
darius
clayhanger
s
estate
maggie
had
taken
over
the
clayhanger
house
and
edwin
paid
rent
to
her
therefor
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
talk
like
that
said
hilda
pouting
amiably
why
not
well
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
anyhow
the
rent
has
to
be
paid
i
suppose
and
i
wish
it
hadn
t
i
wish
we
didn
t
live
in
maggie
s
house
why
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
it
you
re
sentimental
you
can
call
it
what
you
like
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
us
living
in
maggie
s
house
i
never
feel
as
if
i
was
at
home
no
i
don
t
feel
as
if
i
was
at
home
what
a
kid
you
are
you
won
t
change
me
she
persisted
stoutly
he
knew
that
she
was
not
sympathetic
towards
the
good
maggie
and
he
knew
the
reasons
for
her
attitude
though
they
had
never
been
mentioned
one
was
mere
vague
jealousy
of
maggie
as
her
predecessor
in
the
house
the
other
was
that
maggie
was
always
very
tepid
towards
george
george
had
annoyed
her
on
his
visits
previous
to
his
mother
s
marriage
and
moreover
maggie
had
dimly
resented
edwin
s
interest
in
the
son
of
a
mysterious
woman
if
she
had
encountered
george
after
the
proclamation
of
edwin
s
engagement
she
would
have
accepted
the
child
with
her
customary
cheerful
blandness
but
she
had
encountered
him
too
soon
and
her
puzzled
gaze
had
said
to
george
why
is
my
brother
so
taken
up
with
you
there
must
be
an
explanation
and
your
strange
mother
is
the
explanation
edwin
did
not
deny
maggie
s
attitude
to
george
but
he
defended
maggie
as
a
human
being
though
dull
she
was
absolutely
the
right
sort
and
the
very
slave
of
duty
and
loyalty
he
would
have
liked
to
make
hilda
see
all
maggie
s
excellences
do
you
know
what
i
ve
been
thinking
hilda
went
on
suppose
you
were
to
buy
the
house
from
maggie
then
it
would
be
ours
he
answered
with
a
smile
what
price
the
mania
for
owning
things
would
you
like
me
to
there
was
promise
in
his
roguish
voice
oh
i
should
i
ve
often
thought
of
it
she
said
eagerly
and
at
the
same
time
all
her
gestures
and
glances
seemed
to
be
saying
humour
me
i
appeal
to
you
as
a
girl
pouting
and
capricious
but
humour
me
you
know
it
gives
you
pleasure
to
humour
me
you
know
you
like
me
not
to
be
too
reasonable
we
both
know
it
i
want
you
to
do
this
it
was
not
the
fact
that
she
had
often
thought
of
the
plan
but
in
her
eagerness
she
imagined
it
to
be
the
fact
she
had
never
seriously
thought
of
the
plan
until
that
moment
and
it
appeared
doubly
favourable
to
her
now
because
the
execution
of
it
by
absorbing
capital
ought
to
divert
edwin
from
his
lithographic
project
and
perhaps
render
the
lithographic
project
impossible
for
years
she
added
aloud
then
you
wouldn
t
have
any
rent
to
pay
how
true
said
edwin
rallying
her
but
it
would
stand
me
in
a
loss
because
i
should
have
to
pay
too
much
for
the
place
why
she
cried
in
arms
why
should
maggie
ask
too
much
just
because
you
want
it
and
think
of
all
the
money
you
ve
spent
on
it
the
money
spent
on
it
only
increases
its
value
to
maggie
you
don
t
seem
to
understand
landlordism
my
child
but
that
s
not
the
point
at
all
maggie
won
t
ask
any
price
only
i
couldn
t
decently
pay
her
less
than
the
value
she
took
the
house
over
at
when
we
divided
up
to
wit
it
ain
t
worth
that
i
only
pay
rent
if
she
took
it
over
at
too
high
a
value
that
s
her
said
the
harsh
and
unjust
hilda
not
at
all
she
was
a
fool
albert
and
clara
persuaded
her
it
was
a
jolly
good
thing
for
them
i
couldn
t
very
well
interfere
it
seems
a
great
shame
you
should
have
to
pay
for
what
albert
and
clara
did
i
needn
t
unless
i
want
to
only
if
i
buy
the
house
will
have
to
be
the
price
well
said
hilda
i
wish
you
d
buy
it
would
she
feel
more
at
home
if
he
did
he
seductively
chaffed
her
yes
she
would
hilda
straightened
her
shoulders
and
smiled
with
bravado
and
suppose
mag
won
t
sell
will
you
allow
me
to
mention
it
to
her
hilda
s
submissive
tone
implied
that
edwin
was
a
tyrant
who
ruled
with
a
nod
i
don
t
mind
he
said
negligently
well
one
of
these
days
i
just
will
edwin
departed
leaving
the
book
behind
hilda
was
flushed
she
thought
it
is
marvellous
i
can
do
what
i
like
with
him
when
i
use
a
particular
tone
and
look
at
him
in
a
particular
way
i
can
do
what
i
like
with
him
she
was
ecstatically
conscious
of
an
incomprehensible
power
what
a
rôle
that
of
the
capricious
pouting
queen
reclining
luxuriously
on
her
lounge
and
subduing
a
tyrant
to
a
slave
it
surpassed
that
of
the
pianist
iii
but
soon
she
became
more
serious
she
had
a
delicious
glow
of
seriousness
she
overflowed
with
gratitude
to
edwin
his
was
exquisite
he
was
not
perfect
she
could
see
all
his
faults
just
as
plainly
as
when
she
was
angry
with
him
but
he
was
perfect
in
lovableness
she
adored
every
aspect
of
him
every
manifestation
of
his
character
she
felt
her
responsibility
to
him
and
to
george
it
was
hers
to
bring
grace
into
their
lives
without
her
how
miserable
how
uncared
for
those
two
would
be
they
would
be
like
lost
children
nobody
could
do
for
them
what
she
did
money
could
not
buy
what
she
gave
naturally
and
mere
invention
could
not
devise
it
she
looked
up
to
edwin
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
mysteriously
above
both
him
and
george
she
had
a
strange
soft
wisdom
for
them
it
was
agreeable
and
it
was
proper
and
it
was
even
prudent
to
be
capricious
on
occasion
and
to
win
by
pouting
and
wiles
and
seductions
but
beneath
all
that
lay
the
tremendous
sternness
of
the
wife
s
duty
everlasting
and
intricate
a
heavy
obligation
that
demanded
all
her
noblest
powers
for
its
fulfilment
she
rose
heroically
to
the
thought
of
duty
conceiving
it
as
she
had
never
conceived
it
before
she
desired
intensely
to
be
the
most
wonderful
wife
in
the
whole
history
of
marriage
and
she
believed
strongly
in
her
capabilities
she
went
upstairs
to
put
on
another
and
a
finer
dress
for
since
the
disastrous
sequel
to
the
at
home
she
had
somewhat
wearied
in
the
pursuit
of
elegance
she
had
thought
what
is
the
use
of
me
putting
myself
to
such
a
lot
of
trouble
for
a
husband
who
is
insensible
enough
to
risk
my
welfare
unnecessarily
she
was
now
ashamed
of
this
backsliding
ada
was
in
the
bedroom
finicking
with
something
on
the
ada
sprang
to
help
as
soon
as
she
knew
that
her
mistress
had
to
go
out
and
she
openly
admired
the
new
afternoon
dress
and
seemed
as
pleased
as
though
she
was
to
wear
it
herself
and
ada
buttoned
her
boots
and
found
her
gloves
and
her
parasol
and
remembered
her
purse
and
her
bag
and
her
handkerchief
i
don
t
quite
know
what
time
i
shall
be
back
ada
no
m
said
ada
eagerly
as
though
saying
of
course
you
don
t
m
m
you
have
many
engagements
but
no
matter
when
you
come
back
we
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
because
the
house
is
nothing
without
you
of
course
i
shall
be
back
for
tea
oh
yes
m
ada
agreed
as
though
saying
need
you
tell
me
that
m
m
i
know
you
would
never
leave
the
master
to
have
his
tea
alone
hilda
walked
regally
down
the
stairs
and
glanced
round
about
her
at
the
house
which
belonged
to
maggie
and
which
edwin
had
practically
promised
to
buy
yes
it
was
a
fine
house
a
truly
splendid
abode
and
it
seemed
all
the
finer
because
it
was
maggie
s
hilda
had
this
regrettable
human
trait
of
overvaluing
what
was
not
hers
and
depreciating
what
was
it
accounted
in
part
possibly
for
her
often
very
critical
attitude
towards

even

chapter
viii
the
family
at
home
i
when
hilda
knocked
at
the
door
of
auntie
hamps
s
house
in
king
street
a
marvellously
dirty
and
untidy
servant
answered
the
summons
and
a
smell
of
greengage
jam
in
the
making
surged
out
through
the
doorway
into
the
street
the
servant
wore
an
apron
of
rough
sacking
is
miss

in
coldly
asked
hilda
offended
by
the
sight
and
the
smell
the
servant
looked
suspicious
and
mysterious
no

her
s
gone
out

then
missis
is
up
yon
said
the
servant
jerking
her
tousled
head
back
towards
the
stairs
will
you
tell
her
i
m
here
the
servant
left
the
visitor
on
the
doorstep
and
with
an
elephantine
movement
of
the
knees
ran
upstairs
hilda
walked
into
the
passage
towards
the
kitchen
on
the
kitchen
fire
was
the
brilliant
copper
pan
sacred
to
preserving
rows
of
earthenware
and
glass
jars
stood
irregularly
on
the
table

down
said
the
brusque
servant
returning
and
glared

i
wait
in
the
the
house
about
seventy
years
old
was
respectably
situated
in
the
better
part
of
king
street
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
near
luke
s
church
it
had
once
been
occupied
by
a
dentist
of
a
certain
grandeur
and
possessed
a
garden
of
which
however
auntie
hamps
had
made
a
wilderness
the
old
lady
was
magnificent
but
her
magnificence
was
limited
to
herself
she
could
be
sublimely
generous
gorgeously
hospitable
but
only
upon
special
occasions
her
teas
at
which
a
fresh
and
costly
pineapple
and
wonderful
confectionery
and
pickled
salmon
and
silver
plate
never
lacked
were
renowned
but
the
general
level
of
her
existence
was
very
mean
her
servants
of
whom
she
had
many
though
never
more
than
one
at
a
time
were
not
only
obliged
to
be
wesleyan
methodists
and
to
attend
the
sunday
night
service
and
in
the
week
to
go
to
for
the
purpose
of
confessing
sins
and
proving
the
power
of
christ
they
were
obliged
also
to
eat
dripping
instead
of
butter
the
mistress
sometimes
ate
dripping
if
butter
ran
short
or
went
up
in
price
she
considered
herself
a
tremendous
housewife
she
was
a
martyr
to
her
housewifely
ideals
her
private
career
was
chiefly
an
endless
struggle
to
keep
the
house
clean
to
get
forward
with
the
work
the
house
was
always
going
to
be
clean
and
never
was
despite
eternal
soap
scrubbing
rubbing
auntie
hamps
never
changed
her
frowsy
for
rich
visiting
attire
without
the
sad
thought
that
she
was
leaving
something
undone
the
servant
never
went
to
bed
without
hearing
the
discontented
phrase
well
we
must
do
it
in
that
house
lasted
for
six
weeks
on
days
of
hospitality
the
effort
to
get
the
servant
dressed
for
was
simply
desperate
and
not
always
successful
auntie
hamps
had
no
sense
of
comfort
and
no
sense
of
beauty
she
was
incapable
of
leaning
back
in
a
chair
and
she
regarded
linoleum
as
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
inventions
of
the
modern
age
she
saved
her
carpets
by
means
of
patches
of
linoleum
often
stringy
at
the
edges
and
in
some
rooms
there
was
more
linoleum
than
anything
else
in
the
way
of
renewals
she
bought
nothing
but
linoleum
unless
some
chapel
bazaar
forced
her
to
purchase
a
satin
cushion
or
a
all
her
furniture
was
old
decrepit
and
ugly
it
belonged
to
the
worst
victorian
period
when
every
trace
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
disappeared
the
abode
was
always
oppressive
it
was
oppressive
even
amid
hospitality
for
then
the
mere
profusion
on
the
tables
accused
the
rest
of
the
interior
creating
a
feeling
of
discomfort
and
moreover
hamps
could
not
be
hospitable
naturally
she
could
be
nothing
and
do
nothing
naturally
she
could
no
more
take
off
her
hypocrisy
than
she
could
take
off
her
skin
her
hospitality
was
altogether
too
ruthless
and
to
satisfy
that
ruthlessness
the
guests
had
always
to
eat
too
much
she
was
so
determined
to
demonstrate
her
hospitality
to
herself
that
she
would
never
leave
a
guest
alone
until
he
had
reached
the
bursting
point
hilda
sat
grimly
in
the
threadbare
amid
photograph
albums
oleographs
and
beady
knickknacks
and
sniffed
the
strong
odour
of
jam
and
in
the
violence
of
her
revolt
against
that
messy
idolatrous
eternal
domesticity
of
which
auntie
hamps
was
a
classic
example
she
protested
that
she
would
sooner
buy
the
worst
jam
than
make
the
best
and
that
she
would
never
look
under
a
table
for
dust
and
that
naught
should
induce
her
to
do
any
housework
after
midday
and
that
she
would
abolish
utterly
the
vast
mediocre
respectability
of
the
district
weighed
on
her
heart
she
had
been
a
in
brighton
during
a
long
portion
of
her
adult
life
she
knew
the
very
depths
of
domesticity
but
at
brighton
the
eye
could
find
large
rich
luxurious
and
sometimes
beautiful
things
for
its
distraction
and
there
was
the
sea
in
the
five
towns
there
was
nothing
you
might
walk
from
one
end
of
the
five
towns
to
the
other
and
not
see
one
object
that
gave
a
thrill
unless
it
was
a
pair
of
lovers
and
when
you
went
inside
the
houses
you
were
no
better
off
you
were
even
worse
off
because
you
came
at
once
into
contact
with
an
ignoble
race
of
slatternly
imprisoned
serfs
driven
by
women
who
themselves
were
serfs
with
the
mentality
of
serfs
and
the
prodigious
conceit
of
virtue
talk
to
auntie
hamps
at
home
of
or
a
musical
evening
and
she
would
set
you
down
as
flighty
and
shift
the
conversation
on
to
soaps
or
chapels
and
there
were
hundreds
of
houses
in
the
five
towns
into
which
no
ideas
save
the
ideas
of
auntie
hamps
had
ever
penetrated
and
tens
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
such
houses
all
over
the
industrial
districts
of
staffordshire
cheshire
lancashire
and
yorkshire
houses
where
to
keep
bits
of
wood
clean
and
to
fulfil
the
ceremonies
of
pietism
and
to
help
the
poor
to
help
themselves
was
the
highest
good
the
sole
good
hilda
in
her
mind
saw
every
house
and
shuddered
she
turned
for
relief
to
the
thought
of
her
own
house
and
in
a
constructive
spirit
of
rebellion
she
shaped
instantaneously
a
conscious
policy
for
it
yes
she
took
oath
that
her
house
should
at
any
rate
be
intelligent
and
agreeable
before
it
was
clean
she
pictured
auntie
hamps
gazing
at
a
layer
of
dust
in
the
clayhanger
hall
and
heard
herself
saying
oh
yes
auntie
it
s
dust
right
enough
i
keep
it
there
on
purpose
to
remind
me
of
something
i
want
to
remember
she
looked
round
auntie
hamps
s
and
revelled
grimly
in
the
monstrous
catalogue
of
its
mean
ugliness
and
then
auntie
hamps
came
in
splendidly
and
yet
soberly
attired
in
black
to
face
the
world
with
her
upright
vigorous
figure
her
sparkling
eye
and
her
admirable
complexion
smiling
hospitably
quite
unconscious
that
she
was
dead
and
that
her
era
was
dead
and
that
hilda
was
not
guiltless
of
the
murder
this
is
nice
of
you
hilda
it
s
quite
an
honour
and
then
archly
i
m
making
jam
so
i
see
said
hilda
meaning
that
so
she
smelt
i
just
looked
in
on
the
chance
of
seeing
maggie
maggie
went
out
about
ago
auntie
hamps
s
expression
had
grown
mysterious
hilda
thought
what
s
she
hiding
from
me
oh
well
it
doesn
t
matter
said
she
you
re
going
out
too
auntie
i
do
wish
i
d
known
you
were
coming
dear
will
you
stay
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
no
no
i
won
t
keep
you
but
it
will
be
a
dear
auntie
hamps
protested
warmly
no
no
thanks
i
ll
just
walk
along
with
you
a
little
of
the
way
which
direction
are
you
going
auntie
hamps
hesitated
she
was
in
a
dilemma
what
she
hiding
from
me
thought
hilda
the
truth
is
said
auntie
hamps
i
m
just
popping
over
to
clara
s
well
i
ll
go
with
you
auntie
oh
do
exclaimed
hamps
almost
passionately
do
i
m
sure
clara
will
be
delighted
she
added
in
a
casual
tone
maggie
s
there
thought
hilda
she
evidently
doesn
t
want
me
to
go
after
hamps
had
peered
into
the
grand
copper
pan
and
most
particularly
instructed
the
servant
they
set
off
i
shan
t
be
easy
in
my
mind
until
i
get
back
said
auntie
hamps
unless
you
look
after
them
all
the
time
they
always
forget
to
stir
it
ii
when
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
benbows
house
the
was
already
open
and
clara
holding
rupert
her
youngest
by
the
hand
stood
smiling
to
receive
them
obviously
they
had
been
descried
up
the
street
from
one
of
the
this
small
fact
strengthening
in
hilda
s
mind
the
notion
that
the
benbows
were
always
lying
in
wait
and
that
their
existence
was
a
vast
machination
for
getting
the
better
of
other
people
enlivened
her
prejudice
against
her
moreover
clara
was
in
one
of
her
best
dresses
and
her
glance
had
a
peculiar
expression
partly
guilty
and
partly
cunning
nevertheless
the
fair
fragility
of
clara
s
face
with
its
wonderful
skin
and
her
manner
at
once
girlish
and
maternal
of
holding
fast
the
child
s
hand
reacted
considerably
against
hilda
s
prejudice
rupert
was
freshly
all
in
white
stitched
and
embroidered
with
millions
of
plain
and
fancy
stitches
he
had
had
time
neither
to
tear
nor
to
stain
only
on
his
bib
there
was
a
spot
of
jam
his
obese
right
arm
was
stretched
straight
upwards
to
attain
the
immense
height
of
the
hand
of
the
protective
giantess
his
mother
and
this
reaching
threw
the
whole
balance
of
his
little
body
over
towards
the
left
and
gave
him
a
comical
and
wistful
appearance
he
was
a
pretty
and
yet
sturdy
child
with
a
look
indicating
a
nice
disposition
and
he
had
recently
been
acquiring
the
marvellous
gift
of
speech
astounding
how
the
infantile
brain
added
word
to
word
and
phrase
to
phrase
and
as
though
there
were
not
enough
actually
invented
delicious
words
and
graphic
droll
phrases
nobody
could
be
surprised
that
he
became
at
once
the
centre
of
greetings
his
snatched
him
up
and
without
the
slightest
repugnance
he
allowed
the
ancient
woman
to
bury
her
nose
in
his
face
and
neck
and
then
hilda
embraced
him
with
not
less
pleasure
for
the
contact
of
his
delicate
flesh
and
his
flushed
timid
smile
were
exquisite
she
wished
for
a
moment
that
george
was
only
two
and
a
half
again
and
that
she
could
bathe
him
and
wipe
him
and
nurse
him
close
clara
s
pride
though
the
visitors
almost
forgot
to
shake
hands
with
her
was
ecstatic
at
length
rupert
was
safely
on
the
step
once
more
he
had
made
no
remark
whatever
shyness
prevented
him
from
showing
off
his
new
marvellous
gift
but
his
mother
gazing
at
him
said
that
in
ordinary
life
he
never
stopped
chattering
come
this
way
will
you
said
clara
effusively
and
yet
conspiratorially
pointing
to
the
which
was
to
the
left
of
the
from
the
which
was
to
the
right
of
the
issued
confused
sounds
albert
s
here
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
she
added
to
hilda
auntie
hamps
murmured
warningly
into
hilda
s
ear
it
s
bert
s
birthday
party
a
fortnight
earlier
hilda
had
heard
rumours
of
bert
s
approaching
birthday
his
twelfth
and
therefore
a
high
solemnity
but
she
had
very
wrongly
forgotten
about
it
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
clara
repeated
in
the
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
hurt
i
thought
i
d
just
bring
you
in
here
first
and
explain
it
all
to
you
oh
bless
me
exclaimed
auntie
hamps
interrupting
as
she
glanced
round
the
we
are
grand
well
i
never
we
are
grand
do
you
like
it
said
clara
blushing
auntie
hamps
in
reply
told
one
of
the
major
lies
of
her
career
she
said
with
rapture
that
she
did
like
the
new
suite
this
suite
was
a
proof
disagreeable
to
auntie
hamps
that
the
world
would
never
stand
still
it
quite
ignored
all
the
old
victorian
ideals
of
furniture
and
in
ignoring
the
past
it
also
ignored
the
future
victorian
furniture
had
always
sought
after
immortality
in
bursley
there
were
thousands
of
victorian
chairs
and
tables
that
defied
time
and
that
nothing
but
an
axe
or
a
conflagration
could
destroy
but
this
new
suite
thought
not
of
the
morrow
it
did
not
even
pretend
to
think
of
the
morrow
nobody
believed
that
it
would
last
and
the
owners
of
it
simply
forbore
to
reflect
upon
what
it
would
be
after
a
few
years
of
family
use
they
contemplated
with
joy
its
first
state
of
dainty
freshness
and
were
content
therein
whereas
the
old
victorians
lived
in
the
future
in
so
far
as
they
truly
lived
at
all
the
lived
careless
in
the
present
the
suite
was
of
apparent
rosewood
with
upholstery
ending
in
pleats
and
bows
but
white
also
entered
considerably
into
the
scheme
for
enamel
paint
had
just
reached
bursley
and
was
destined
to
become
the
rage
among
the
items
of
the
suite
was
a
in
deal
covered
with
white
enamel
paint
heightened
by
bows
of
imitation
silk
society
had
recently
been
thunderstruck
by
the
originality
of
putting
a
in
a
its
quaintness
appealed
with
tremendous
force
to
nearly
all
hearts
nearly
every
on
seeing
a
in
a
friend
s
decided
that
she
must
have
a
in
her
and
took
measures
to
get
one
clara
was
among
the
earlier
possessors
the
pioneers
ten
years
five
years
before
clara
had
appropriated
the
word
æsthetic
as
a
term
of
sneering
abuse
with
but
a
vague
idea
of
its
meaning
and
now
such
is
the
miraculous
effect
of
time
she
was
caught
up
in
the
movement
as
it
had
ultimately
spread
to
the
five
towns
a
willing
convert
and
captive
and
nothing
could
exceed
her
scorn
for
that
which
once
she
had
admired
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
into
that
respectable
house
situate
in
a
rather
street
leading
from
shawport
lane
to
the
canal
and
whose
boast
even
when
inhabited
by
was
that
it
overlooked
the
rectory
garden
the
new
ideals
of
brightness
freshness
eccentricity
brittleness
and
impermanency
had
entered
and
auntie
hamps
herself
was
intimidated
by
them
hilda
gave
polite
but
perfunctory
praise
left
alone
she
might
not
have
been
averse
from
the
new
ideals
in
their
more
expensive
forms
but
the
influence
of
edwin
had
taught
her
to
despise
them
edwin
s
tastes
in
furniture
imbibed
from
the
orgreaves
neglected
the
modern
and
went
even
further
back
than
earliest
victorian
much
of
the
ugliness
bought
by
his
father
remained
in
the
clayhanger
house
but
all
edwin
s
own
purchases
were
either
antique
or
if
new
careful
imitations
of
the
had
england
been
peopled
by
edwins
all
original
artists
in
furniture
might
have
died
of
hunger
yet
he
encouraged
original
literature
what
however
put
hilda
against
clara
s
suite
was
not
its
style
nor
its
enamel
nor
its
frills
nor
the
obviously
inferior
quality
of
its
varnish
but
the
mere
fact
that
it
had
been
exposed
for
sale
in
nixon
s
in
duck
bank
with
the
price
marked
hilda
did
not
like
this
now
edwin
might
see
an
old
in
some
frowsy
shop
at
hanbridge
or
turnhill
and
from
indecision
might
leave
it
in
the
shop
for
months
and
then
buy
it
and
hang
it
up
at
home
and
instantly
it
was
somehow
transformed
into
another
a
superior
and
personal
but
clara
s
suite
was
not
for
hilda
thus
transformed
indeed
as
she
sat
there
in
clara
s
she
had
the
illusion
of
sitting
in
nixon
s
shop
further
nixon
had
now
got
in
his
window
another
suite
precisely
like
clara
s
it
was
astonishing
to
hilda
that
clara
was
not
ashamed
of
the
publicity
and
the
wholesale
reproduction
of
her
suite
but
she
was
not
on
the
contrary
she
seemed
to
draw
a
mysterious
satisfaction
from
the
very
fact
that
suites
precisely
similar
to
hers
were
to
be
found
or
would
soon
be
found
in
unnumbered
other
nor
did
she
mind
that
the
price
was
notorious
and
in
the
matter
of
the
price
the
phrase
flitted
about
in
hilda
s
brain
she
felt
sure
that
albert
benbow
had
not
paid
cash
to
nixon
she
regarded
the
system
as
unrespectable
if
not
immoral
and
this
opinion
was
one
of
the
very
few
she
shared
with
auntie
hamps
both
ladies
in
their
hearts
and
in
the
security
of
their
financial
positions
blamed
the
benbows
for
imprudence
nobody
not
even
his
wife
knew
just
how
albert
stood
but
many
took
leave
to
guess
and
guessed
unfavourably
do
sit
down
said
clara
too
urgently
she
was
so
preoccupied
that
hilda
s
indifference
to
her
new
furniture
did
not
affect
her
they
all
sat
down
primly
in
the
pretty
primness
of
the
and
rupert
leaned
as
if
tired
against
his
mother
s
fine
skirt
hilda
expectant
glanced
vaguely
about
her
auntie
hamps
did
the
same
on
the
central
table
lay
a
dictionary
of
the
english
language
open
and
leaves
downwards
and
near
it
a
piece
of
paper
containing
a
long
list
of
missing
words
in
pencil
auntie
hamps
as
soon
as
her
gaze
fell
on
these
objects
looked
quickly
away
as
though
she
had
by
accident
met
the
obscene
clara
caught
the
movement
flushed
somewhat
and
recovered
herself
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
she
repeated
yet
again
to
hilda
with
a
smile
i
did
so
want
to
explain
to
you
how
it
was
we
didn
t
ask
george
i
was
afraid
you
might
be
vexed
what
an
idea
hilda
murmured
as
naturally
as
she
could
her
nostrils
twitching
uneasily
in
the
atmosphere
of
small
feuds
and
misunderstandings
which
clara
breathed
with
such
pleasure
she
laughed
to
reassure
clara
and
also
in
enjoyment
of
the
thought
that
for
days
clara
had
pictured
her
as
wondering
sensitively
why
no
invitation
to
the
party
had
come
for
george
while
in
fact
the
party
had
never
crossed
her
mind
she
regretted
that
she
had
no
gift
for
bert
but
decided
to
give
him
for
his
account
of
which
she
had
heard
a
lot
to
tell
ye
the
truth
said
clara
launching
herself
we
ve
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
bert
albert
s
been
quite
put
about
it
was
only
the
day
before
yesterday
albert
got
out
of
him
the
truth
about
the
night
of
your
at
home
hilda
when
he
ran
away
after
he
d
gone
to
bed
albert
said
to
him
i
shan
t
whip
you
and
i
shan
t
put
you
on
bread
and
water
only
if
you
don
t
tell
me
what
you
were
doing
that
night
there
ll
be
no
birthday
and
no
birthday
party
that
s
so
at
last
bert
gave
in
and
d
you
know
what
he
was
doing
holding
a
with
your
george
and
that
boy
of
clowes
s
next
door
to
your
house
down
hulton
street
did
you
know
hilda
shook
her
head
bravely
officially
she
did
not
know
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
thing
exclaimed
auntie
hamps
yes
proceeded
clara
taking
breath
for
a
new
start
and
bert
s
story
is
that
they
prayed
for
a
penknife
for
your
george
and
it
came
and
then
they
prayed
for
a
bicycle
for
our
bert
but
the
bicycle
didn
t
come
and
then
bert
and
george
had
a
fearful
quarrel
and
george
gave
him
the
penknife
made
him
have
it
and
then
said
he
d
never
speak
to
him
any
more
as
long
as
he
lived
at
first
albert
was
inclined
to
thrash
bert
for
telling
lies
and
being
irreverent
but
in
the
end
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
at
any
rate
bert
was
telling
what
he
thought
to
be
the
truth
and
that
clowes
boy
is
so
bert
wanted
his
birthday
party
of
course
but
he
begged
and
prayed
us
not
to
ask
george
so
in
the
end
we
decided
we
d
better
not
and
we
let
him
have
his
own
way
that
s
all
there
is
to
it
so
george
has
said
nothing
not
a
word
replied
hilda
and
the
clowes
boy
is
so
said
clara
again
she
went
suddenly
to
the
mantelpiece
and
picked
up
a
penknife
and
offered
it
to
hilda
here
s
the
penknife
of
course
albert
took
it
off
him
why
said
hilda
ingenuously
but
clara
detected
satire
and
repelled
it
with
a
glance
it
s
not
edwin
s
penknife
i
suppose
she
queried
in
a
severe
tone
no
it
isn
t
i
ve
never
seen
it
before
why
we
were
only
thinking
edwin
might
have
overheard
the
boys
and
thrown
a
knife
over
the
wall
it
would
be
just
like
edwin
that
would
oh
no
the
deceitful
hilda
blew
away
such
a
possibility
i
m
quite
sure
he
didn
t
said
she
and
added
mischievously
as
she
held
out
the
penknife
i
thought
all
you
folks
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
these
simple
words
were
never
forgiven
by
clara
the
next
moment
having
restored
the
magic
penknife
to
the
mantelpiece
and
gathered
up
her
infant
she
was
leading
the
way
to
the
come
along
rupy
my
darling
said
she
rupy
hilda
privately
imitated
her
deriding
the
absurdity
of
the
diminutive
if
you
ask
me
said
auntie
hamps
determined
to
save
the
honour
of
the
family
it
s
that
little
clowes
monkey
that
is
responsible
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
since
you
told
me
about
it
last
night
clara
and
i
feel
almost
sure
it
must
have
been
that
little
clowes
monkey
she
was
magnificent
she
was
no
longer
a
worried
about
the
processes
of
but
a
grandiose
figure
out
in
the
world
a
figure
symbolic
upon
whom
had
devolved
the
duty
of
keeping
up
appearances
on
behalf
of
all
mankind
iii
the
had
not
yet
begun
to
move
with
the
times
it
was
rather
a
shabby
apartment
accustomed
to
daily
and
its
contents
dated
from
different
periods
the
most
ancient
object
of
all
stretching
backwards
in
family
history
to
the
epoch
of
albert
s
this
was
an
oak
occupied
usually
by
albert
but
on
the
present
occasion
by
his
son
and
heir
bert
bert
spectacled
was
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
at
the
foot
was
his
auntie
maggie
in
front
of
a
down
the
sides
of
the
table
were
his
sisters
thin
clara
fat
amy
and
little
lucy
the
first
nearly
as
old
as
bert
and
his
father
two
plates
showed
that
the
mother
and
rupert
had
left
the
meal
to
greet
the
visitors
and
there
were
two
other
empty
places
in
a
tiny
vase
in
front
of
amy
was
a
solitary
flower
the
room
was
nearly
full
it
had
an
odour
of
cake
tea
and
children
well
here
we
are
said
clara
entering
with
the
guests
and
rupert
very
cheerfully
getting
on
all
right
she
gave
albert
a
glance
which
said
i
have
explained
everything
but
hilda
is
a
very
peculiar
creature
albert
answered
hello
all
you
aunties
albert
left
the
works
early
on
purpose
clara
explained
her
husband
s
presence
he
was
a
happy
man
in
early
adolescence
he
had
taken
to
sunday
schools
as
some
youths
take
to
vice
he
loved
to
exert
authority
over
children
and
experience
had
taught
him
all
the
principal
dodges
under
the
forms
of
benevolent
autocracy
he
could
exercise
a
ruthless
discipline
upon
youngsters
he
was
not
at
all
ashamed
at
being
left
in
charge
of
a
tableful
of
children
while
his
wife
went
forth
to
conduct
diplomatic
interviews
at
the
same
time
he
had
his
pride
thus
he
would
express
no
surprise
nor
even
pleasure
at
the
presence
of
hilda
his
theory
being
that
it
ought
to
be
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
indeed
he
was
preoccupied
by
the
management
of
the
meal
and
he
did
not
conceal
the
fact
he
shook
hands
with
the
ladies
in
a
perfunctory
style
which
seemed
to
say
now
the
supreme
matter
is
this
birthday
repast
i
am
running
it
and
i
am
running
it
very
well
slip
inobtrusively
into
your
places
in
the
machine
and
let
me
continue
my
work
of
direction
nevertheless
he
saw
to
it
that
all
the
children
rose
politely
and
saluted
according
to
approved
precedents
his
eye
was
upon
them
he
attached
importance
to
every
little
act
in
any
series
of
little
acts
if
he
cut
the
cake
he
had
the
air
of
announcing
to
the
world
this
is
a
beautiful
cake
i
have
carefully
estimated
the
merits
of
this
cake
and
mother
has
carefully
estimated
them
we
have
in
fact
all
come
to
a
definite
and
favourable
conclusion
about
this
cake
namely
that
it
is
a
beautiful
cake
i
will
now
cut
it
the
operation
of
cutting
it
is
a
major
operation
watch
me
cut
it
and
then
watch
me
distribute
it
wisdom
and
justice
shall
preside
over
the
distribution
even
if
he
only
passed
the
salt
he
passed
it
as
though
he
were
passing
extreme
unction
auntie
hamps
with
apparent
delight
adapted
herself
to
his
humour
she
said
she
would
squeeze
in
anywhere
and
was
soon
engaged
in
finding
perfection
in
everything
that
appertained
to
the
benbow
family
hilda
not
being
quite
so
intimate
with
the
household
was
installed
with
more
ceremony
she
could
not
keep
out
of
her
eye
the
idea
that
it
was
droll
to
see
a
stoutish
somewhat
man
neglecting
his
business
in
order
to
take
charge
of
a
of
small
children
and
albert
observing
this
could
not
keep
out
of
his
eye
the
rebutting
assertion
that
it
was
not
in
the
least
droll
but
entirely
proper
and
laudable
the
first
mention
of
birthday
presents
came
from
auntie
hamps
who
remarked
with
enthusiasm
that
bert
looked
a
regular
little
man
in
his
beautiful
new
spectacles
bert
glowering
gloomy
and
yet
proud
and
above
all
grew
even
more
at
this
statement
spectacles
had
been
ordained
for
him
by
the
oculist
and
his
parents
had
had
the
hardihood
to
offer
him
his
first
pair
for
a
birthday
present
they
had
so
insisted
on
the
beauty
and
originality
of
the
scheme
that
bert
himself
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
to
get
a
pair
of
spectacles
for
a
birthday
present
was
a
great
thing
in
a
boy
s
life
he
was
now
wearing
the
spectacles
for
the
first
time
on
the
whole
gloom
outbalanced
pride
in
his
demeanour
and
bert
s
mysterious
soul
which
had
flabbergasted
his
father
for
about
a
week
peeped
out
sidelong
occasionally
through
those
spectacles
in
bitter
criticism
of
the
institution
of
parents
he
ate
industriously
soon
auntie
hamps
leaning
over
rapped
down
on
his
sticky
plate
everybody
pretended
to
be
overwhelmed
though
nobody
entitled
to
prophesy
had
expected
less
almost
simultaneously
with
the
ring
of
the
gold
on
the
plate
clara
said
now
what
do
you
say
but
albert
was
judiciously
benevolent
leave
him
alone
mother
he
ll
say
it
all
right
i
m
sure
he
will
his
mother
agreed
and
bert
said
it
blushing
and
fingering
the
coin
nervously
and
auntie
hamps
sat
like
an
antique
goddess
bland
superb
morally
immense
and
even
her
dirty
and
broken
detracted
naught
from
her
grandiosity
she
might
feed
servants
on
dripping
but
when
the
proper
moment
came
she
could
fling
about
with
anybody
and
then
opening
her
purse
hilda
added
five
shillings
to
the
amid
admiring
exclamations
sincere
and
insincere
beside
auntie
hamps
s
gold
the
two
cut
a
poor
figure
and
therefore
hilda
almost
without
discontinuing
the
gesture
of
largesse
said
that
is
from
uncle
edwin
and
this
putting
a
florin
and
three
shillings
more
to
the
treasure
is
from
auntie
hilda
somehow
she
was
talking
as
the
others
talked
and
she
disliked
herself
for
yielding
to
the
spirit
of
the
benbow
home
but
she
could
not
help
it
the
pervading
spirit
conquered
everybody
she
felt
and
bert
s
was
still
further
increased
as
the
exclamations
grew
in
power
and
sincerity
though
he
experienced
the
mournful
pride
of
rich
possessions
he
knew
well
that
the
money
would
be
of
no
real
value
his
presents
all
useful
save
a
bouquet
of
flowers
from
rupert
were
all
useless
to
him
thus
the
prim
young
clara
had
been
parentally
guided
to
give
him
a
comb
if
all
the
combs
in
the
world
had
been
suddenly
annihilated
bert
would
not
have
cared
would
indeed
have
rejoiced
and
as
to
the
spectacles
he
would
have
preferred
the
prospect
of
total
blindness
in
middle
age
to
the
compulsion
of
wearing
them
who
can
wonder
that
his
father
had
not
fathomed
the
mind
of
the
strange
creature
albert
gazed
rapt
at
the
beautiful
sight
of
the
plate
it
reminded
him
pleasantly
of
a
at
the
sunday
school
anniversary
sermons
in
a
moment
the
conversation
ran
upon
accounts
each
child
had
a
account
and
their
riches
were
astounding
rupert
had
an
account
and
was
getting
interest
at
the
rate
of
two
and
a
half
per
cent
on
six
pounds
ten
shillings
the
thriftiness
of
the
elder
children
had
reached
amounts
which
might
be
mentioned
with
satisfaction
even
to
the
luxurious
wife
of
the
richest
member
of
the
family
young
clara
was
the
wealthiest
of
the
band
i
ve
got
the
most
haven
t
i
fardy
she
said
with
complacency
i
ve
got
more
than
bert
haven
t
i
nobody
seemed
to
know
how
it
was
that
she
had
surpassed
bert
who
had
had
more
birthdays
and
more
christmases
the
inferiority
of
the
eldest
could
not
be
attributed
to
dissipation
or
improvidence
for
none
of
the
children
was
allowed
to
spend
a
cent
the
devoured
all
and
never
rendered
back
however
bert
was
now
creeping
up
and
his
mother
exhorted
him
to
do
his
best
in
future
she
then
took
the
money
from
the
plate
and
promised
bert
for
the
morrow
the
treat
of
accompanying
her
to
the
post
office
in
order
to
bury
it
a
bell
rang
within
the
house
and
at
once
young
clara
exclaimed
oh
there
s
flossie
oh
my
word
she
is
late
isn
t
she
fardy
what
a
good
thing
we
didn
t
wait
tea
for
her
move
up
miss
this
to
lucy
people
who
are
late
must
take
the
consequences
especially
little
girls
said
albert
in
reply
and
presently
flossie
entered
tripping
shrugging
up
her
shoulders
and
throwing
back
her
mane
and
wonderfully
innocent
this
is
flossie
who
is
always
late
albert
introduced
her
to
hilda
am
i
really
said
flossie
in
a
very
low
soft
voice
with
a
bright
and
apparently
frightened
smile
dark
flossie
was
of
amy
s
age
and
supposed
to
be
amy
s
particular
friend
she
was
the
daughter
of
young
clara
s
music
mistress
the
little
girl
s
prestige
in
the
benbow
house
was
due
to
two
causes
first
she
was
graceful
and
rather
stylish
in
movement
qualities
which
none
of
the
benbow
children
had
though
young
clara
was
pretty
enough
and
second
her
mother
had
rather
more
pupils
than
she
could
comfortably
handle
and
indeed
sometimes
refused
a
pupil
flossie
with
her
physical
elegance
was
like
a
foreigner
among
the
benbows
she
had
a
precocious
demeanour
she
shook
hands
and
embraced
like
a
woman
and
she
gave
her
birthday
gift
to
bert
as
if
she
were
distributing
a
prize
it
was
a
with
a
patent
sharpener
bert
would
have
preferred
a
bicycle
but
the
patent
sharpener
made
an
oasis
in
his
day
his
father
pointed
out
to
him
that
as
the
pencil
was
already
sharpened
he
could
not
at
present
use
the
sharpener
amy
thereupon
furtively
passed
him
the
stump
of
a
pencil
to
operate
upon
and
then
his
mother
told
him
that
he
had
better
postpone
his
first
sharpening
until
he
got
into
the
garden
where
bits
of
wood
would
not
be
untidy
flossie
carefully
settled
her
very
short
white
skirts
on
a
chair
smiling
all
the
time
and
enquired
about
two
brothers
whom
she
had
been
told
were
to
be
among
the
guests
albert
informed
her
with
solemnity
that
these
two
brothers
were
both
down
with
measles
and
that
auntie
hamps
and
auntie
hilda
had
come
to
make
up
for
their
absence
poor
things
murmured
flossie
sympathetically
hilda
laughed
and
flossie
screwing
up
her
eyes
and
shrugging
up
her
shoulders
laughed
too
as
if
saying
you
and
i
alone
understand
me
what
a
pretty
flower
flossie
exclaimed
in
her
low
soft
voice
indicating
the
flower
in
the
vase
in
front
of
amy
there
s
half
a
crumb
left
said
albert
passing
the
to
flossie
carefully
we
thought
we
d
better
keep
it
for
you
though
we
don
t
reckon
to
keep
anything
for
little
girls
that
come
late
amy
whispered
her
mother
leaning
towards
the
fat
girl
wouldn
t
it
be
nice
of
you
to
give
your
flower
to
flossie
amy
started
i
don
t
want
to
she
whispered
back
flushing
the
flower
was
a
gift
to
amy
from
bert
out
of
the
birthday
bunch
presented
to
him
by
rupert
mysterious
relations
existed
between
bert
and
the
benignant
acquiescent
amy
oh
amy
her
mother
protested
still
whispering
but
shocked
tears
came
into
amy
s
eyes
these
tears
amy
at
length
wiped
away
and
straightening
her
face
offered
the
flower
with
stiff
outstretched
arm
to
her
friend
flossie
and
flossie
smilingly
accepted
it
it
kind
of
you
you
darling
said
flossie
and
stuck
the
flower
in
an
interstice
of
her
embroidered
pinafore
amy
gravely
lacking
in
began
to
whimper
again
that
s
my
good
little
girl
muttered
clara
to
her
exhibiting
pride
in
her
daughter
s
victory
over
self
and
rubbed
the
child
s
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
the
parents
were
continually
thus
bringing
up
their
children
hilda
pressed
her
lips
together
immediately
afterwards
it
was
noticed
that
flossie
was
no
longer
eating
i
ve
had
quite
enough
thank
you
said
she
in
answer
to
expostulations
no
jam
even
and
you
ve
not
finished
your
tea
i
ve
had
quite
enough
thank
you
said
she
and
folded
up
her
napkin
please
father
can
we
go
and
play
in
the
garden
now
bert
asked
albert
looked
at
his
wife
yes
i
think
they
might
said
clara
go
and
play
nicely
they
all
rose
now
quietly
albert
warned
them
and
they
went
from
the
room
quietly
each
in
his
own
fashion
flossie
like
a
modest
tsarina
young
clara
full
of
virtue
and
holding
rupert
by
the
hand
amy
lumpily
tiny
lucy
as
one
who
had
too
soon
been
robbed
of
the
privilege
of
being
the
youngest
and
bert
in
the
rear
like
a
criminal
who
is
observed
in
a
suspicious
act
and
albert
blew
out
wind
as
if
getting
rid
of
a
great
weight
iv
finished
your
greengage
auntie
asked
clara
after
the
pause
which
ensued
while
the
adults
were
accustoming
themselves
to
the
absence
of
the
children
and
it
was
maggie
who
answered
rather
eagerly
no
she
hasn
t
she
s
left
it
to
the
tender
mercies
of
that
maria
she
wouldn
t
let
me
stay
and
she
wouldn
t
stay
herself
these
were
almost
the
first
words
save
murmurings
as
to
cups
of
tea
quantities
of
sugar
and
of
milk
that
the
taciturn
maggie
had
uttered
since
hilda
s
arrival
she
was
not
sulky
she
had
merely
been
devoting
herself
and
allowing
herself
to
be
exploited
in
the
vacuous
manner
customary
to
her
and
listening
receptively
or
perhaps
not
even
receptively
offering
no
remark
save
that
the
mechanism
of
the
repast
would
have
creaked
and
stopped
at
her
departure
she
might
have
slipped
from
the
room
unnoticed
as
a
cat
but
now
she
spoke
as
one
capable
of
enthusiasm
and
resentment
on
behalf
of
an
ideal
to
her
it
was
scandalous
that
greengage
jam
should
be
jeopardised
for
the
sake
of
social
pleasures
and
suddenly
it
became
evident
she
and
her
auntie
had
had
a
difference
on
the
matter
hamps
said
stoutly
and
defiantly
with
grandeur
well
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
my
eldest
s
twelfth
birthday
party
interfered
with
for
any
jam
hear
hear
said
hilda
liking
the
terrific
woman
for
an
instant
but
mild
maggie
was
inflexible
clara
knowing
that
in
maggie
very
slight
symptoms
had
enormous
significance
at
once
changed
the
subject
albert
went
to
the
back
window
whence
by
twisting
his
neck
he
could
descry
a
corner
of
the
garden
said
clara
smiling
i
hear
you
re
going
to
have
some
hilda
on
sunday
nights
malice
and
ridicule
were
in
clara
s
tone
on
the
phrase
musical
evenings
she
put
a
strange
disdainful
emphasis
as
though
a
musical
evening
denoted
something
not
only
unrighteous
but
snobbish
and
absurd
yet
envy
also
was
in
her
tone
hilda
was
startled
ah
who
told
you
that
never
mind
i
heard
said
clara
darkly
hilda
wondered
where
the
benbows
from
whom
seemingly
naught
could
be
concealed
had
in
fact
got
this
of
news
by
tacit
consent
she
and
edwin
had
as
yet
said
nothing
to
anybody
except
the
orgreaves
who
alone
with
tertius
ingpen
and
one
or
two
more
intimates
were
invited
or
were
to
be
invited
to
the
first
evening
relations
between
the
orgreaves
and
the
benbows
scarcely
existed
we
re
having
a
little
music
on
sunday
night
said
hilda
as
it
were
apologetically
and
scorning
herself
for
being
apologetic
why
should
she
be
apologetic
to
these
base
creatures
but
she
couldn
t
help
it
the
public
opinion
of
the
room
was
too
much
for
her
she
even
added
we
re
hoping
that
old
orgreave
will
come
it
will
be
the
first
time
she
s
been
out
in
the
evening
for
ever
so
long
the
name
of
orgreave
was
calculated
by
hilda
to
overawe
them
and
stop
their
mouths
no
name
however
could
overawe
hamps
she
smiled
kindly
and
with
respect
for
the
caprices
of
others
she
spoke
in
a
tone
exceptionally
polite
but
what
she
said
was
i
m
sorry
i
m
sorry
the
deliverance
was
final
auntie
hamps
was
almost
as
deeply
moved
about
the
approaching
desecration
of
the
sabbath
as
maggie
had
been
about
the
casual
treatment
of
jam
in
earlier
years
she
would
have
said
a
great
deal
more
just
as
in
earlier
years
she
would
have
punctuated
bert
s
birthday
mouthfuls
with
descants
upon
the
excellence
of
his
parents
and
moral
exhortations
to
himself
but
auntie
hamps
was
growing
older
and
quieter
and
i
m
sorry
i
m
sorry
meant
much
from
her
hilda
became
sad
disgusted
indignant
moody
the
breach
which
separated
her
and
edwin
from
the
rest
of
the
family
was
enormous
as
might
be
seen
in
the
mere
fact
that
they
had
never
for
a
moment
contemplated
asking
anybody
in
the
family
to
the
musical
evening
nor
had
the
family
ever
dreamed
of
an
invitation
it
was
astonishing
that
edwin
should
be
so
different
from
the
others
but
after
all
was
he
she
could
see
in
him
sometimes
bits
of
maggie
of
clara
and
even
of
the
unspeakable
she
was
conscious
of
her
grievances
against
edwin
among
these
was
that
he
never
or
scarcely
ever
praised
her
at
moments
when
she
had
tried
hard
she
felt
a
great
need
of
praise
but
edwin
would
watch
her
critically
with
the
damnable
grim
detachment
of
the
five
towns
towards
a
stranger
or
a
returned
exile
as
she
sat
in
the
stuffy
of
the
benbows
surrounded
by
hostilities
and
incomprehensions
she
had
a
sensation
of
unreality
or
at
any
rate
of
a
vast
mistake
why
was
she
there
was
she
not
tied
by
intimate
experience
to
a
man
at
that
very
instant
in
prison
she
had
a
fearful
vision
of
him
in
prison
she
sitting
there
in
the
midst
of
maggie
clara
and
auntie
hamps
was
she
not
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
boy
victimised
or
not
innocent
or
not
she
a
guest
at
bert
s
intensely
legitimate
birthday
fête
was
the
mother
of
an
illegitimate
boy
incredible
she
ought
never
to
have
married
into
the
clayhangers
never
to
have
come
back
to
this
cackling
provincial
district
all
these
people
were
inimical
towards
her
because
she
represented
the
luxury
and
riches
and
worldly
splendour
of
the
family
and
because
her
illegitimate
boy
had
tempted
the
heir
of
the
benbows
to
blasphemous
wickedness
and
because
she
herself
had
tempted
a
weak
edwin
to
abandon
chapel
and
to
desecrate
the
sabbath
and
again
because
she
without
a
penny
of
her
own
had
stepped
in
and
now
represented
the
luxury
and
riches
and
worldly
splendour
of
the
family
and
all
the
family
s
grievances
against
edwin
were
also
grievances
against
her
once
long
ago
when
he
was
yet
a
bachelor
and
had
no
hope
of
hilda
edwin
had
prevented
his
father
in
dotage
from
lending
a
thousand
pounds
to
albert
upon
no
security
the
interference
was
unpardonable
and
hilda
would
not
be
pardoned
for
it
such
was
marriage
into
a
family
such
was
family
life
yes
she
felt
unreal
there
and
also
unsafe
she
had
prevaricated
about
george
and
the
penknife
and
she
had
allowed
clara
to
remain
under
the
impression
that
her
visit
to
the
house
was
a
birthday
visit
auntie
hamps
and
destiny
between
them
would
lay
bare
all
this
lying
the
antipathy
against
her
would
increase
but
let
it
increase
never
so
much
it
still
would
not
equal
hilda
s
against
the
family
as
she
thrilled
to
it
then
their
narrow
ignorance
their
narrow
their
detestation
of
beauty
their
pietism
their
bigotry
revolted
her
in
what
century
had
they
been
living
all
those
years
was
this
married
life
had
albert
and
clara
ever
felt
a
moment
of
mutual
passion
they
were
nothing
but
parents
eternally
preoccupied
with
oughts
and
ought
nots
and
forbiddances
and
horrid
reluctant
permissions
they
did
not
know
what
joy
was
and
they
did
not
want
anybody
else
to
know
what
joy
was
even
on
the
outskirts
of
such
a
family
a
musical
evening
on
a
sunday
night
appeared
a
forlorn
enterprise
and
all
the
families
in
all
the
streets
were
the
same
hilda
was
hard
enough
on
george
sometimes
but
in
that
moment
she
would
have
preferred
george
to
be
a
thoroughly
bad
rude
boy
and
to
go
to
the
devil
and
herself
to
be
a
woman
abandoned
to
every
licence
rather
than
that
he
and
she
should
resemble
clara
and
her
offspring
all
her
wrath
centred
upon
clara
as
the
very
symbol
of
what
she
loathed
hello
cried
the
watchful
albert
from
the
window
what
s
happening
i
wonder
in
a
moment
rupert
ran
into
the
room
and
without
a
word
scrambled
on
his
mother
s
lap
absolutely
confident
in
her
goodness
and
power
what
s
amiss
tuppenny
asked
his
father
tired
answered
rupert
with
a
faint
endearing
smile
he
laid
himself
close
against
his
mother
s
breast
and
drew
up
his
knees
and
clara
held
his
body
in
her
arms
and
whispered
to
him
amy
udn
t
play
with
me
he
murmured
wouldn
t
she
naughty
amy
mammy
tired
too
he
glanced
upwards
at
his
mother
s
eyes
in
sympathy
and
immediately
he
was
asleep
clara
kissed
him
bending
her
head
down
and
with
difficulty
reaching
his
cheek
with
her
lips
auntie
hamps
enquired
fondly
what
does
he
mean
mother
tired
too
well
said
clara
the
fact
is
some
of
em
were
so
excited
they
stopped
my
afternoon
sleep
this
afternoon
i
always
do
have
my
nap
you
know
she
looked
at
hilda
in
here
when
this
door
s
closed
they
know
mother
mustn
t
be
disturbed
only
this
afternoon
lucy
or
amy
i
don
t
know
which
and
i
didn
t
enquire
too
closely
forgot
he
s
remembered
it
the
little
turk
is
he
asleep
hilda
demanded
in
a
low
voice
fast
he
s
been
like
that
lately
he
ll
play
a
bit
and
then
he
ll
stop
and
say
he
s
tired
and
sometimes
cry
and
he
ll
come
to
me
and
be
asleep
in
two
jiffs
i
think
he
s
been
a
bit
run
down
he
said
he
had
toothache
yesterday
it
was
nothing
but
a
little
cold
they
ve
all
had
colds
but
i
wrapped
his
face
up
to
please
him
he
looked
so
sweet
in
his
bandage
i
assure
you
i
didn
t
want
to
take
it
off
again
no
i
didn
t
i
wonder
why
amy
wouldn
t
play
with
him
she
s
such
a
splendid
playmate
when
she
likes
full
of
imagination
simply
full
of
it
albert
had
approached
from
the
window
with
an
air
of
important
conviction
he
said
to
hilda
yes
amy
s
imagination
is
really
remarkable
as
no
one
responded
to
this
statement
he
drummed
on
the
table
to
ease
the
silence
and
then
suddenly
added
well
i
suppose
i
must
be
getting
on
with
my
dictionary
reading
i
m
only
at
s
and
there
s
bound
to
be
a
lot
of
words
under
u
beginning
with
you
know
i
saw
at
once
there
would
be
he
spoke
rather
defiantly
as
though
challenging
public
opinion
to
condemn
his
new
dubious
activity
oh
said
clara
albert
s
quite
taken
up
with
missing
words
nowadays
but
instead
of
conning
his
dictionary
albert
returned
to
the
window
drawn
by
his
inexhaustible
paternal
curiosity
and
he
even
opened
the
window
and
leaned
out
so
that
he
might
more
effectively
watch
the
garden
and
with
the
fresh
air
there
entered
the
high
gay
inspiriting
voices
of
the
children
clara
smiled
down
at
the
boy
sleeping
in
her
lap
she
was
happy
the
child
was
happy
his
flushed
face
with
its
expression
of
loving
innocence
was
exquisitely
touching
clara
s
face
was
full
of
proud
tenderness
everybody
gazed
at
the
picture
with
secret
and
profound
pleasure
hilda
wished
once
more
that
george
was
only
two
and
a
half
years
old
again
george
s
infancy
and
her
early
motherhood
had
been
very
different
from
all
this
she
had
never
been
able
to
shut
a
door
or
any
other
door
as
a
sign
that
she
must
not
be
disturbed
and
certainly
george
had
never
sympathetically
remarked
that
she
was
tired
she
was
envious
and
yet
a
minute
ago
she
had
been
execrating
the
family
life
of
the
benbows
the
complexity
of
the
tissue
of
existence
was
puzzling
v
when
albert
brought
his
head
once
more
into
the
room
he
suddenly
discovered
the
stuffiness
of
the
atmosphere
and
with
the
large
free
gestures
of
a
mountaineer
and
a
sanitarian
threw
open
both
windows
as
wide
as
possible
the
bleak
wind
from
the
moorlands
surged
in
fluttering
curtains
and
lowering
the
temperature
at
a
run
won
t
rupert
catch
cold
hilda
suggested
chilled
he
s
got
to
be
hardened
rupert
has
albert
replied
easily
fresh
air
nothing
like
it
does
em
good
to
feel
it
hilda
thought
pity
you
didn
t
think
so
a
bit
earlier
her
countenance
was
too
expressive
albert
divined
some
ironic
thought
in
her
brain
and
turned
on
her
with
a
sort
of
parrying
jeer
and
how
s
the
great
man
getting
along
in
this
phrase
which
both
he
and
clara
employed
with
increasing
frequency
albert
let
out
not
only
his
jealousy
of
but
his
respect
for
the
head
of
the
family
hilda
did
not
like
it
but
it
flattered
her
on
edwin
s
behalf
and
she
never
showed
her
resentment
of
the
attitude
which
prompted
it
edwin
oh
he
s
all
right
he
s
working
she
put
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
last
pronoun
in
order
revengefully
to
contrast
edwin
s
industry
with
albert
s
presence
during
business
hours
at
a
children
s
birthday
party
he
said
to
me
as
he
went
out
that
he
must
go
and
earn
something
towards
maggie
s
rent
she
laughed
softly
clara
smiled
cautiously
maggie
smiled
and
blushed
a
little
albert
did
not
commit
himself
only
auntie
hamps
laughed
without
reserve
edwin
will
have
his
joke
said
she
although
hilda
had
audaciously
gone
forth
that
afternoon
with
the
express
intention
of
opening
negotiations
on
her
own
initiative
with
maggie
for
the
purchase
of
the
house
she
had
certainly
not
meant
to
discuss
the
matter
in
the
presence
of
the
entire
family
but
she
was
seized
by
one
of
her
characteristic
impulses
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
it
with
the
usual
mixture
of
glee
and
apprehension
she
said
i
suppose
you
wouldn
t
care
to
sell
us
the
house
would
you
maggie
everybody
became
alert
and
as
it
grew
apparent
that
the
company
was
assisting
at
the
actual
birth
of
a
family
episode
or
incident
a
peculiar
feeling
of
eager
pleasure
spread
through
the
room
and
the
appetite
for
leapt
up
indeed
i
should
maggie
answered
with
a
deepening
flush
and
all
were
astonished
at
her
decisiveness
and
at
the
warmth
of
her
tone
i
never
wanted
the
house
only
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
have
it
so
of
course
i
took
it
the
victim
was
speaking
money
was
useless
to
her
for
she
was
incapable
of
turning
it
into
happiness
but
she
had
her
views
on
finance
and
property
nevertheless
and
though
in
all
such
matters
she
did
as
she
was
told
submissively
accepting
the
decisions
of
brother
or
as
decrees
of
fate
yet
she
was
quite
aware
of
the
victimhood
the
assemblage
was
surprised
and
even
a
little
intimidated
by
her
mild
outburst
but
you
ve
got
a
very
good
tenant
maggie
said
auntie
hamps
enthusiastically
she
s
got
a
very
good
tenant
admitted
albert
said
judicially
and
almost
sternly
but
she
d
never
have
any
difficulty
in
finding
a
very
good
tenant
for
that
house
that
s
not
the
point
the
point
is
that
the
investment
really
isn
t
remunerative
maggie
could
do
much
better
for
herself
than
that
very
much
better
why
if
she
went
the
right
way
about
it
she
could
get
ten
per
cent
on
her
money
i
know
of
things
and
i
bet
she
doesn
t
get
three
and
a
half
per
cent
clear
from
the
house
not
three
and
a
half
he
glanced
reproachfully
at
hilda
do
you
mean
the
rent
s
too
low
hilda
questioned
boldly
he
hesitated
losing
courage
i
don
t
say
it
s
too
low
but
maggie
perhaps
took
the
house
over
at
too
big
a
figure
maggie
looked
up
at
her
and
whose
fault
was
that
she
asked
sharply
the
general
surprise
was
intensified
no
one
could
understand
maggie
no
one
had
the
wit
to
perceive
that
she
had
been
truly
annoyed
by
auntie
hamps
s
negligence
in
regard
to
jam
and
was
momentarily
capable
of
bitterness
whose
fault
was
that
she
repeated
you
and
clara
and
edwin
settled
it
between
you
you
yourself
said
over
and
over
again
it
was
a
fair
figure
i
thought
so
at
the
time
i
thought
so
at
the
time
said
albert
quickly
we
all
acted
for
the
best
i
m
sure
you
did
murmured
auntie
hamps
i
should
think
so
indeed
murmured
clara
seeking
to
disguise
her
constraint
by
attentions
to
the
sleeping
rupert
is
edwin
thinking
of
buying
then
albert
asked
hilda
in
a
quiet
studiously
careless
voice
we
ve
discussed
it
responded
hilda
because
if
he
is
he
ought
to
take
it
over
at
the
price
mag
took
it
at
she
oughtn
t
to
lose
on
it
that
s
only
fair
i
m
sure
edwin
would
never
do
anything
unfair
said
auntie
hamps
hilda
made
no
reply
she
had
already
heard
the
argument
from
edwin
and
albert
now
seemed
to
her
more
tedious
and
unprincipled
than
usual
her
reason
admitted
the
force
of
the
argument
as
regards
maggie
but
instinct
opposed
it
nevertheless
she
was
conscious
of
sudden
sympathy
for
maggie
and
of
a
weakening
of
her
prejudice
against
her
hadn
t
we
better
be
going
auntie
maggie
curtly
and
reproachfully
suggested
you
know
quite
well
that
jam
stands
a
good
chance
of
being
ruined
i
suppose
we
had
auntie
hamps
concurred
with
a
sigh
and
rose
i
shall
be
able
to
carry
out
my
plan
thought
hilda
full
of
wisdom
and
triumph
and
she
saw
edwin
owner
of
the
house
with
his
wild
lithographic
project
scotched
and
the
realisation
of
her
own
sagacity
thus
exercised
on
behalf
of
those
she
loved
made
her
glad
at
the
same
moment
just
as
albert
was
recommencing
his
flow
the
door
opened
and
edwin
entered
he
had
glimpsed
the
children
in
the
garden
and
had
come
into
the
house
by
the
back
way
there
were
cries
of
stupefaction
and
bliss
both
albert
and
clara
were
unmistakably
startled
and
flattered
indeed
several
seconds
elapsed
before
albert
could
assume
the
proper
grim
casual
air
auntie
hamps
rejoiced
and
sat
down
again
maggie
disclosed
no
feeling
and
she
would
not
sit
down
again
hilda
had
a
serious
qualm
she
was
obliged
to
persuade
herself
that
in
opening
the
negotiations
for
the
house
she
had
not
committed
an
enormity
she
felt
less
sagacious
and
less
dominant
who
could
have
dreamt
that
edwin
would
pop
in
just
then
it
was
notorious
it
was
even
a
subject
of
complaint
that
he
never
popped
in
in
reply
to
enquiries
he
stammered
in
his
customary
hesitating
way
that
he
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
on
business
and
that
it
had
occurred
to
him
etc
in
short
there
he
was
aren
t
you
coming
auntie
maggie
demanded
let
me
have
a
look
at
edwin
child
said
auntie
hamps
somewhat
nettled
how
set
you
are
then
i
shall
go
alone
said
maggie
yes
but
what
about
this
house
business
albert
tried
to
stop
her
he
could
not
stop
her
finance
houses
rents
were
not
real
to
her
she
owned
but
did
not
possess
such
things
but
the
endangered
jam
was
real
to
her
she
did
not
own
it
but
she
possessed
it
she
departed
what
s
amiss
with
her
murmured
hamps
i
must
go
too
or
i
shall
be
catching
it
my
word
i
shall
what
house
business
edwin
asked
well
said
albert
i
like
that
aren
t
you
trying
to
buy
her
house
from
her
we
ve
just
been
talking
it
over
edwin
glanced
swiftly
at
hilda
and
hilda
knew
from
the
peculiar
constrained
almost
shamefaced
expression
on
his
features
that
he
was
extremely
annoyed
he
gave
a
little
nervous
laugh
oh
have
ye
he
muttered
vi
although
edwin
discussed
the
purchase
of
the
house
quite
calmly
with
albert
and
appeared
to
regard
it
as
an
affair
practically
settled
hilda
could
perceive
from
a
single
gesture
of
his
in
the
lobby
as
they
were
leaving
that
his
resentment
against
herself
had
not
been
diminished
by
the
smooth
course
of
talking
nevertheless
she
was
considerably
startled
by
his
outburst
in
the
street
it
s
a
pity
maggie
went
off
like
that
she
said
quietly
you
might
have
fixed
everything
up
immediately
then
it
was
that
he
turned
on
her
glowering
angrily
why
on
earth
did
you
go
talking
about
it
without
telling
me
first
he
demanded
furious
but
it
was
understood
dear
she
smiled
affecting
not
to
perceive
his
temper
and
thereby
aggravating
it
he
almost
shouted
nothing
of
the
kind
nothing
of
the
kind
maggie
was
there
i
just
happened
to
mention
it
hilda
was
still
quite
placid
you
went
down
on
purpose
to
tell
her
so
you
needn
t
deny
it
do
you
take
me
for
a
fool
her
placidity
was
undiminished
of
course
i
don
t
take
you
for
a
fool
dear
i
assure
you
i
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
you
d
be
annoyed
yes
you
had
i
could
see
it
on
your
face
when
i
came
in
don
t
try
to
stuff
me
up
you
go
blundering
into
a
thing
without
the
least
notion
without
the
least
notion
i
ve
told
you
before
and
i
tell
you
again
i
won
t
have
you
interfering
in
my
business
affairs
you
know
nothing
of
business
you
ll
make
my
life
impossible
all
you
women
are
the
same
you
will
poke
your
noses
in
there
ll
have
to
be
a
clear
understanding
between
you
and
me
on
one
or
two
points
before
we
go
much
further
but
you
told
me
i
could
mention
it
to
her
no
i
didn
t
you
did
edwin
do
be
just
i
didn
t
say
you
could
go
and
plunge
right
into
it
at
once
these
things
have
to
be
thought
out
houses
aren
t
bought
like
that
a
house
isn
t
a
pound
of
tea
and
it
isn
t
a
hat
i
m
very
sorry
no
you
aren
t
and
you
know
jolly
well
you
aren
t
your
scheme
was
simply
to
tie
my
hands
she
knew
the
truth
of
this
and
her
smile
became
queer
nevertheless
the
amiable
calm
which
she
maintained
astonished
even
herself
she
was
not
happy
but
certainly
she
was
not
unhappy
she
had
got
or
she
was
going
to
get
what
she
wanted
and
here
was
the
only
fact
important
to
her
the
means
by
which
she
had
got
it
or
was
going
to
get
it
were
negligible
now
it
cost
her
very
little
to
be
magnanimous
she
wondered
at
edwin
was
this
furious
brute
the
timid
worshipping
boy
who
had
so
marvellously
kissed
her
a
dozen
years
earlier
before
she
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
scoundrel
were
these
scenes
what
the
exquisite
romance
of
marriage
had
come
to
well
and
if
it
was
so
what
then
if
she
was
not
happy
she
was
elated
and
she
was
philosophic
and
she
had
the
terrific
sense
of
realities
of
some
of
her
sex
she
was
out
of
the
benbow
house
she
breathed
free
she
had
triumphed
and
she
had
her
man
to
herself
he
might
be
a
brute
the
five
towns
she
had
noticed
as
a
returned
exile
were
full
of
brutes
whose
passions
surged
and
boiled
beneath
the
phlegmatic
surface
but
he
existed
and
their
love
existed
and
a
peep
into
the
depth
of
the
cauldron
was
exciting
the
injustice
or
the
justice
of
his
behaviour
did
not
make
a
live
question
moreover
she
did
not
in
truth
seriously
regard
him
as
a
brute
she
regarded
him
as
an
unreasonable
creature
something
like
a
baby
to
be
humoured
in
the
inessentials
of
a
matter
of
which
the
essentials
were
now
definitely
in
her
favour
his
taunt
that
she
went
blundering
into
a
thing
and
that
she
knew
naught
of
business
amused
her
she
knew
her
own
business
and
knew
it
profoundly
the
actual
situation
was
a
proof
of
that
as
for
abstract
principles
of
business
the
conventions
and
etiquette
of
it
her
lips
condescendingly
curled
after
all
what
had
she
done
to
merit
this
fury
nothing
nothing
what
could
it
matter
whether
the
negotiations
were
begun
instantly
or
in
a
week
s
or
a
month
s
time
edwin
would
have
probably
for
three
months
or
six
she
had
merely
said
a
few
harmless
words
offered
a
suggestion
and
now
he
desired
to
tear
her
limb
from
limb
and
eat
her
alive
it
was
comical
impossible
for
her
to
be
angry
in
her
triumph
it
was
too
comical
she
had
married
an
astounding
personage
but
she
had
married
him
he
was
hers
she
exulted
in
the
possession
of
him
his
absurd
peculiarities
did
not
lower
him
in
her
esteem
she
had
a
perfect
appreciation
of
his
points
including
his
general
wisdom
but
she
was
convinced
that
she
had
a
special
and
different
and
superior
kind
of
wisdom
and
a
nice
thing
you
ve
let
maggie
in
for
edwin
broke
out
afresh
after
a
spell
of
silent
walking
let
maggie
in
for
she
exclaimed
lightly
albert
ought
never
to
have
known
anything
of
it
until
it
was
all
settled
he
will
be
yarning
away
to
her
about
how
he
can
use
her
money
for
her
and
what
he
gets
hold
of
she
ll
never
see
again
you
may
bet
your
boots
on
that
if
you
d
left
it
to
me
i
could
have
fixed
things
up
for
her
in
advance
but
no
in
you
must
go
up
to
the
neck
and
ruin
everything
oh
she
said
reassuringly
you
ll
be
able
to
look
after
maggie
all
right
he
sniffed
and
settled
down
into
embittered
disgust
quickening
somewhat
his
speed
up
the
slope
of
acre
lane
please
don
t
walk
so
fast
edwin
she
breathed
just
like
a
nice
little
girl
i
can
t
keep
up
with
you
in
spite
of
his
enormous
anger
he
could
not
refuse
such
a
request
she
was
getting
the
better
of
him
again
he
knew
it
he
could
see
through
the
devices
with
an
irritated
swing
of
his
body
he
slowed
down
to
suit
her
she
had
a
glimpse
of
his
set
gloomy
savage
ruthless
face
the
lower
lip
bulging
out
really
it
was
grotesque
were
they
grown
up
he
and
she
she
smiled
almost
fearing
that
might
notice
his
preposterous
condition
all
the
way
up
acre
lane
and
across
by
luke
s
churchyard
into
trafalgar
road
they
walked
thus
side
by
side
in
silence
by
strange
good
luck
they
did
not
meet
a
single
acquaintance
and
as
edwin
had
a
latchkey
no
servant
had
to
come
and
open
the
door
and
behold
them
edwin
throwing
his
hat
on
the
stand
ran
immediately
upstairs
hilda
passed
idly
into
the
she
was
glad
to
be
in
her
own
again
it
was
a
distinguished
apartment
after
clara
s
there
lay
the
dvorak
music
on
the
piano
the
atmosphere
seemed
full
of
ozone
she
rang
for
ada
and
spoke
to
her
with
charming
friendliness
about
master
george
master
george
had
returned
from
an
informal
cricket
match
in
the
manor
fields
and
was
in
the
garden
yes
ada
had
seen
to
his
everything
was
in
order
for
the
new
term
shortly
to
commence
but
master
george
had
received
a
blow
from
the
on
his
shin
which
was
black
and
blue
had
ada
done
anything
to
the
shin
no
master
george
would
not
let
her
touch
it
but
she
had
been
allowed
to
see
it
very
well
ada
there
was
something
beatific
about
the
state
of
being
mistress
of
a
house
without
the
mistress
the
house
would
simply
crumble
to
pieces
hilda
went
upstairs
she
was
apprehensive
but
her
apprehensiveness
was
agreeable
to
her
no
edwin
was
not
in
the
bedroom
she
could
hear
him
in
the
bathroom
she
tried
the
door
it
was
bolted
he
always
bolted
it
edwin
what
is
it
he
opened
the
door
he
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
had
just
finished
with
the
towel
she
entered
and
shut
the
door
and
bolted
it
and
then
she
began
to
kiss
him
she
kissed
him
time
after
time
on
his
cheek
so
damp
and
fresh
poor
dear
she
murmured
she
knew
that
he
could
not
altogether
resist
those
repeated
kisses
they
were
more
effective
than
the
best
arguments
or
the
most
graceful
articulate
surrenders
thus
she
completed
her
triumph
but
whether
the
virtue
of
the
kisses
lay
in
their
sensuousness
or
in
their
sentiment
neither
he
nor
she
knew
and
she
did
not
care
she
did
not
kiss
him
with
abandonment
there
was
a
reserve
in
her
kisses
and
in
her
smile
indeed
she
went
on
kissing
him
rather
sternly
her
glance
when
their
eyes
were
very
close
together
was
curious
it
seemed
to
imply
we
are
in
love
and
we
love
i
am
yours
you
are
mine
life
is
very
fine
after
all
i
am
a
happy
woman
but
still
is
for
himself
in
this
and
that
s
the
bedrock
of
marriage
as
of
all
other
institutions
her
sense
of
realities
again
and
she
went
on
kissing
irresistibly
kiss
me
and
he
had
to
kiss
her
whereupon
she
softened
to
him
and
abandoned
herself
to
the
emanations
of
his
charm
and
her
lips
became
almost
liquid
as
she
kissed
him
again
nevertheless
there
was
still
a
slight
reserve
in
her
kisses
at
tea
she
chattered
like
a
magpie
as
the
saying
is
between
her
and
george
there
seemed
to
be
a
secret
instinctive
understanding
that
edwin
had
to
be
humoured
enlivened
drawn
into
talk
for
although
he
had
kissed
her
his
mood
was
yet
by
no
means
restored
to
the
normal
he
would
have
liked
to
remain
majestic
within
the
tent
of
his
soul
but
they
were
too
clever
for
him
then
to
achieve
his
discomfiture
entered
johnnie
orgreave
with
a
suggestion
that
they
should
all
four
edwin
hilda
janet
and
himself
go
to
the
theatre
at
hanbridge
that
night
hilda
accepted
the
idea
instantly
since
her
marriage
her
appetite
for
pleasure
had
developed
enormously
at
moments
she
was
positively
greedy
for
pleasure
she
was
incapable
of
being
bored
at
the
theatre
she
would
sooner
be
in
the
theatre
of
a
night
than
out
of
it
oh
do
let
s
go
she
cried
edwin
did
not
want
to
go
but
he
had
to
concur
he
did
not
want
to
be
pleasant
to
johnnie
orgreave
or
to
anybody
but
he
had
to
be
pleasant
be
on
the
first
car
that
goes
up
after
seven
fifteen
said
johnnie
as
he
was
departing
edwin
grunted
you
understand
teddy
the
first
car
that
goes
up
after
seven
fifteen
all
right
all
right
blithely
hilda
went
to
beautify
herself
and
when
she
had
beautified
herself
and
made
herself
into
a
queen
of
whom
the
haughtiest
might
be
proud
she
despatched
ada
for
master
george
and
master
george
had
to
come
to
her
bedroom
let
me
look
at
that
leg
she
said
sit
down
devious
creature
during
tea
she
had
not
even
divulged
that
she
had
heard
of
the
damaged
shin
master
george
was
taken
by
surprise
he
sat
down
she
knelt
and
herself
unloosed
the
stocking
and
exposed
the
little
calf
the
place
was
black
and
blue
but
it
had
a
healthy
look
it
s
nothing
she
said
and
then
all
in
her
splendid
finery
she
kissed
the
dirty
discoloured
shin
strange
he
was
only
two
years
old
and
just
learning
to
talk
now
then
missis
here
s
the
tram
edwin
yelled
out
loudly
roughly
from
below
he
would
have
given
a
sovereign
to
see
her
miss
the
car
but
his
inconvenient
sense
of
justice
forced
him
to
warn
her
coming
coming
she
kissed
master
george
on
the
mouth
eagerly
and
george
seemed
unusually
to
return
the
eagerness
she
ran
down
the
darkening
stairs
ecstatic
in
the
dusky
road
edwin
curtly
signalled
to
the
vast
ascending
and
it
stopped
those
were
in
the
old
days
when
people
did
what
they
liked
with
the
cars
stopping
them
here
and
stopping
them
there
according
to
their
fancy
the
era
of
electricity
and
fixed
and
soulless
conscienceless
control
from
london
had
not
set
in
edwin
and
hilda
mounted
two
hundred
yards
further
on
the
was
once
more
arrested
and
johnnie
and
janet
joined
them
hilda
was
in
the
highest
spirits
the
great
affair
of
the
afternoon
had
not
been
a
quarrel
but
an
animating
experience
which
though
dangerous
intensified
her
and
her
zest
chapter

the
i
the
events
of
the
portentous
which
included
the
musical
evening
began
early
on
the
saturday
and
the
first
one
was
a
chance
word
uttered
by
george
breakfast
was
nearly
over
in
the
clayhanger
hilda
sat
opposite
to
edwin
and
george
between
them
they
had
all
eaten
with
appetite
and
the
disillusion
which
usually
accompanies
the
satisfaction
of
desire
was
upon
them
they
had
looked
forward
to
breakfast
scenting
with
zest
its
pleasing
odours
and
breakfast
was
over
save
perhaps
for
a
final
unnecessary
piece
of
toast
or
half
a
cup
of
chilled
coffee
hilda
did
not
want
to
move
because
she
did
not
care
for
the
saturday
morning
task
of
shopping
and
and
being
bland
with
in
the
emporiums
the
were
too
frequently
open
on
saturday
mornings
and
thereat
and
a
wind
blowing
through
the
house
and
it
was
the
morning
for
specially
cleaning
the
hall
detestable
and
damp
operation
and
servants
seemed
loose
on
saturday
morning
and
dinner
was
apt
to
be
late
but
hilda
knew
she
would
have
to
move
to
postpone
was
only
to
aggravate
destiny
grasped
her
firm
george
was
not
keen
about
moving
because
he
had
no
plan
of
campaign
the
desolating
prospect
of
resuming
school
on
monday
had
withered
his
energy
he
was
in
a
mood
to
be
either
a
martyr
or
a
villain
edwin
was
lazily
sardonic
partly
because
the
leisure
of
breakfast
was
at
an
end
partly
because
he
hated
the
slackness
of
saturday
morning
at
the
shop
and
partly
because
his
relations
with
hilda
had
remained
indefinite
and
disquieting
despite
a
thousand
mutual
urbanities
and
thoughtful
refinements
and
even
some
caresses
a
sense
of
aimlessness
dejected
him
and
in
the
central
caves
of
his
brain
the
question
was
mysteriously
stirring
what
is
the
use
of
all
these
things
success
dignity
importance
luxury
love
sensuality
order
moral
superiority
he
foresaw
thirty
years
of
breakfasts
with
plenty
of
the
finest
bacon
and
fresh
eggs
but
no
romance
before
his
marriage
he
used
to
read
the
paper
honestly
and
rudely
at
breakfast
that
is
to
say
he
would
prop
it
up
squarely
in
front
of
him
hiding
his
sister
maggie
and
anyhow
ignoring
her
and
maggie
had
to
like
it
or
lump
it
she
probably
lumped
it
but
upon
marriage
he
had
become
a
chevalier
he
had
nobly
decided
that
it
was
not
correct
to
put
a
newspaper
between
yourself
and
a
woman
who
had
denied
you
nothing
nevertheless
his
appetite
for
newspapers
being
almost
equal
to
his
appetite
for
bacon
he
would
still
take
nips
at
the
newspaper
during
breakfast
hold
it
in
one
hand
glance
at
it
drop
it
pick
it
up
talk
amiably
while
glancing
at
it
drop
it
pick
it
up
again
so
long
as
the
newspaper
was
held
aside
and
did
not
touch
the
table
so
long
as
he
did
not
read
more
than
ten
lines
at
a
time
he
considered
that
punctilio
was
satisfied
and
that
he
was
not
in
fact
reading
the
newspaper
at
all
but
towards
the
end
of
breakfast
when
the
last
food
was
disappearing
and
he
had
lapped
the
cream
off
the
news
he
would
hold
the
newspaper
in
both
hands
and
brazenly
and
conscientiously
read
his
chief
interest
just
then
was
political
like
most
members
of
his
party
he
was
endeavouring
to
decipher
the
party
programme
and
not
succeeding
and
he
feared
for
his
party
and
was
a
little
ashamed
for
it
grave
events
had
occurred
the
substructure
of
the
state
was
rocking
a
newly
elected
supporter
of
the
government
unaware
that
he
was
being
admitted
to
the
best
club
in
london
had
gone
to
the
house
of
commons
in
a
tweed
cap
and
preceded
by
a
serious
pillars
of
society
knew
that
the
time
had
come
to
invest
their
savings
abroad
edwin
with
many
another
ardent
liberal
was
seeking
to
persuade
himself
that
everything
was
all
right
after
all
the
domestic
atmosphere
hilda
s
baffling
face
the
emptied
table
the
shadow
of
business
repletion
early
symptoms
of
indigestion
the
sound
of
a
in
the
hall
did
not
aid
him
to
optimism
in
brief
the
morning
was
a
fair
specimen
of
a
kind
of
morning
that
seemed
likely
to
be
for
him
an
average
morning
can
t
i
leave
the
table
mother
asked
george
discontentedly
hilda
nodded
george
gave
a
coarse
sound
of
glee
george
that
s
so
unlike
you
his
mother
frowned
instead
of
going
directly
towards
the
door
he
must
needs
pass
right
round
the
table
behind
the
chair
of
his
occupied
uncle
as
he
did
so
he
scanned
the
newspaper
and
read
out
loudly
in
passing
for
the
benefit
of
the
room
local
divorce
case
etches
etches
painful
the
words
meant
nothing
to
george
they
had
happened
to
catch
his
eye
he
read
them
as
he
might
have
read
an
extract
from
the
books
of
euclid
and
noisily
and
ostentatiously
departed
not
without
a
further
protest
from
hilda
and
edwin
and
hilda
left
alone
together
were
lively
kid
murmured
edwin
and
hilda
you
never
told
me
that
case
was
on
i
didn
t
know
till
i
saw
it
here
what
s
the
result
not
finished
here
you
are
if
you
want
to
read
it
he
handed
the
sheet
across
the
table
despite
his
serious
interest
in
politics
he
had
read
the
report
before
anything
else
etches
etches
indeed
surpassed
gladstonian
politics
as
an
aid
to
the
dubious
prosperity
of
the
very
young
morning
newspaper
which
represented
the
latest
and
most
original
attempt
to
challenge
the
journalistic
monopoly
of
the
afternoon
it
lived
scarcely
longer
than
the
divorce
case
for
the
proprietors
though
and
therefore
astute
had
failed
to
foresee
that
the
five
towns
public
would
not
wait
for
racing
results
until
the
next
morning
thanks
hilda
amiably
and
negligently
murmured
edwin
hummed
useless
for
hilda
to
take
that
casual
tone
useless
for
edwin
to
hum
the
unconcealable
thought
in
both
their
minds
was
and
each
could
divine
the
other
s
thought
and
almost
hear
its
vibration
we
might
end
in
the
divorce
court
too
hence
their
the
thought
was
absurd
irrational
indefensible
shocking
it
had
no
father
and
no
mother
it
sprang
out
of
naught
but
it
existed
and
it
had
force
enough
to
make
them
uncomfortable
the
etches
couple
belonging
to
the
great
numerous
wealthy
and
respectable
family
of
etches
had
been
married
barely
a
year
edwin
rose
and
glanced
at
his
fingernails
the
pleasant
animation
of
his
skin
caused
by
the
bath
was
still
perceptible
he
could
feel
it
in
his
back
and
it
helped
his
conviction
of
virtue
he
chose
a
cigarette
out
of
his
silver
case
a
good
cigarette
a
good
case
and
lit
it
and
waved
the
match
into
extinction
and
puffed
out
much
smoke
and
regarded
the
correctness
of
the
crease
in
his
trousers
the
vertical
having
recently
been
introduced
into
the
district
and
insisted
on
by
that
tailor
and
artist
and
seeker
after
perfection
shillitoe
and
walked
firmly
to
the
door
but
the
remained
just
as
he
reached
the
door
his
wife
gazing
at
the
newspaper
stopped
him
edwin
what
s
up
he
did
not
move
from
the
door
and
she
did
not
look
up
from
the
newspaper
seen
your
friend
big
james
this
morning
edwin
usually
went
down
to
business
before
breakfast
so
that
his
conscience
might
be
free
for
a
leisurely
meal
at
nine
o
clock
big
james
was
the
oldest
employee
in
the
business
originally
he
had
been
foreman
compositor
and
was
still
technically
so
described
but
in
fact
he
was
general
manager
and
edwin
s
majestic
vicegerent
in
all
the
ask
big
james
was
the
watchword
of
the
whole
organism
no
said
edwin
why
oh
nothing
it
doesn
t
matter
edwin
had
made
certain
resolutions
about
his
temper
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
such
a
reply
justified
annoyance
and
he
therefore
permitted
himself
to
be
annoyed
failing
to
see
that
serenity
is
a
positive
virtue
only
when
there
is
justification
for
annoyance
the
nincompoop
had
not
even
begun
to
perceive
that
what
is
called
means
the
acceptance
of
injustice
and
the
excusing
of
the
inexcusable
now
then
he
said
brusquely
out
with
it
but
there
was
still
a
trace
of
rough
tolerance
in
his
voice
no
it
s
all
right
i
was
wrong
to
mention
it
her
admission
of
sin
did
not
in
the
least
placate
him
he
advanced
towards
the
table
you
haven
t
mentioned
it
he
said
stiffly
their
eyes
met
as
hilda
s
quitted
the
newspaper
he
could
not
read
hers
she
seemed
very
calm
he
thought
as
he
looked
at
her
how
strange
it
is
that
i
should
be
living
with
this
woman
what
is
she
to
me
what
do
i
know
of
her
she
said
with
tranquillity
if
you
do
see
big
james
you
might
tell
him
not
to
trouble
himself
about
that
programme
programme
what
programme
he
asked
startled
oh
edwin
she
gave
a
little
laugh
the
musical
evening
programme
of
course
aren
t
we
having
a
musical
evening
night
more
justification
for
annoyance
why
should
she
confuse
the
situation
by
pretending
that
he
had
forgotten
the
musical
evening
the
pretence
was
idiotic
deceiving
no
one
the
musical
evening
was
constantly
being
mentioned
reports
of
assiduous
practising
had
reached
them
and
on
the
previous
night
they
had
had
quite
a
subdued
altercation
over
a
proposal
of
hilda
s
for
altering
the
furniture
in
the
this
is
the
first
i
ve
heard
of
any
programme
said
edwin
do
you
mean
a
printed
programme
of
course
she
could
mean
nothing
else
he
was
absolutely
staggered
at
the
idea
that
she
had
been
down
to
his
works
without
a
word
to
him
and
given
orders
to
big
james
or
even
talked
to
big
james
about
a
programme
she
had
no
remorse
she
had
no
sense
of
danger
had
she
the
slightest
conception
of
what
business
was
imagine
maggie
attempting
such
a
thing
it
was
simply
not
conceivable
a
wife
going
to
her
husband
s
works
and
behind
his
back
giving
orders
it
was
as
though
a
natural
law
had
suspended
its
force
why
edwin
she
said
in
extremely
clear
somewhat
surprised
and
gently
benevolent
accents
what
ever
s
the
matter
with
you
there
a
programme
of
music
i
suppose
there
she
was
ridiculously
changing
the
meaning
of
the
word
programme
what
infantile
tactics
it
occurred
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
yesterday
afternoon
how
nice
it
would
be
to
have
it
printed
on
cards
so
i
ran
down
to
the
shop
but
you
weren
t
there
so
i
saw
big
james
you
never
said
anything
to
me
about
it
last
night
nor
this
morning
didn
t
i
well
i
forgot
grotesque
creature
well
what
did
big
james
say
oh
don
t
ask
me
but
if
he
treats
all
your
customers
as
he
treated
me
however
it
doesn
t
matter
now
i
shall
write
the
programme
out
myself
what
did
he
say
it
wasn
t
what
he
said
but
he
s
very
rude
you
know
other
people
think
so
too
what
other
people
oh
never
mind
who
of
course
know
how
to
take
it
and
i
know
you
believe
in
him
blindly
but
his
airs
are
preposterous
and
he
s
a
dirty
old
man
and
i
say
edwin
seeing
how
very
particular
you
are
about
things
at
home
you
really
ought
to
see
that
the
front
shop
is
kept
cleaner
it
s
no
affair
of
mine
and
i
never
interfere
but
really
not
a
phrase
of
this
speech
but
what
was
highly
and
deliberately
provocative
assuredly
no
other
person
had
ever
said
that
big
james
was
rude
but
someone
else
said
so
after
all
suppose
challenged
she
gave
a
name
big
james
s
airs
were
not
preposterous
he
was
merely
old
and
dignified
his
apron
and
hands
were
dirty
naturally
and
then
the
implication
that
big
james
was
a
fraud
and
that
he
edwin
was
simpleton
enough
to
be
victimised
by
the
fraud
while
the
great
hilda
exposed
it
at
a
single
glance
and
the
implication
that
he
edwin
was
fussy
at
home
and
negligent
at
the
shop
and
the
astounding
assertion
that
she
never
interfered
he
smothered
up
all
his
feelings
with
difficulty
as
a
sailor
smothers
up
a
lowered
sail
in
a
high
wind
and
merely
demanded
for
the
third
time
what
did
big
james
say
i
was
given
to
understand
said
hilda
roguishly
that
it
was
quite
quite
quite
impossible
but
his
majesty
would
see
well
he
needn
t
i
see
how
wrong
i
was
to
suggest
it
at
all
edwin
moved
away
in
silence
are
you
going
edwin
she
asked
innocently
yes
glumly
you
haven
t
kissed
me
she
did
not
put
him
to
the
shame
of
returning
to
her
no
she
jumped
up
blithely
radiant
her
that
nothing
had
happened
was
maddening
she
kissed
him
lovingly
with
a
smile
more
than
once
he
did
not
kiss
he
was
kissed
nevertheless
somehow
the
kissing
modified
his
mental
position
and
he
felt
better
after
it
don
t
work
yourself
up
darling
she
counselled
him
with
kindness
and
concern
as
he
went
out
of
the
room
you
know
how
sensitive
you
are
it
was
a
calculated
insult
but
an
insult
which
had
to
be
ignored
to
notice
it
would
have
been
a
grave
tactical
error
ii
when
he
reached
the
shop
he
sat
down
at
his
old
desk
in
the
cubicle
and
spied
forth
and
around
for
the
alleged
dust
which
he
would
tolerate
in
business
but
would
not
tolerate
at
home
it
was
there
he
could
see
places
that
had
obviously
not
been
touched
for
weeks
withdrawn
places
where
the
undisturbed
mounds
of
stock
and
litter
had
the
eternal
character
of
roman
remains
or
vestiges
of
creation
the
senior
was
in
the
shop
snuffling
over
a
parcel
boy
said
edwin
what
time
do
you
come
here
in
the
morning
a
past
seven
sir
well
on
monday
morning
you
ll
be
here
at
seven
and
you
ll
move
everything
there
and
there
and
there
and
sweep
and
dust
properly
this
shop
s
like
a
pigstye
i
believe
you
never
dust
anything
but
the
counters
he
was
mild
but
firm
he
knew
himself
for
a
just
man
yet
the
fact
that
he
was
robbing
this
boy
of
s
sleep
and
probably
the
boy
s
mother
also
and
upsetting
the
ancient
order
of
the
boy
s
household
did
not
trouble
him
did
not
even
occur
to
him
for
him
the
boy
had
no
mother
and
no
household
but
was
a
patent
boy
that
came
miraculously
into
existence
on
the
shop
doorstep
every
morning
and
achieved
annihilation
thereon
every
night
the
boy
was
a
fatalist
but
his
fatalism
had
limits
because
he
well
knew
that
the
demand
for
was
greater
than
the
supply
though
the
limits
of
his
fatalism
had
not
yet
been
reached
he
was
scarcely
pleased
if
i
come
at
seven
who
ll
gi
me
th
kays
sir
he
demanded
rather
surlily
wiping
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
i
ll
see
that
you
have
the
keys
said
edwin
with
divine
assurance
though
he
had
not
thought
of
the
difficulty
of
the
keys
the
boy
left
the
shop
his
body
thrown
out
of
the
perpendicular
by
the
weight
of
the
parcel
you
ought
to
keep
an
eye
on
this
place
said
edwin
quietly
to
the
young
man
who
combined
the
function
of
clerk
with
that
of
salesman
to
the
rare
retail
customers
i
can
t
see
to
everything
here
check
these
wages
for
me
he
indicated
small
piles
of
money
yes
sir
said
the
clerk
with
but
admitting
the
justice
of
the
animadversion
edwin
seldom
had
difficulty
with
his
employees
serious
friction
was
unknown
in
the
establishment
he
went
out
by
the
thinking
it
s
no
affair
whatever
of
hers
moreover
the
shop
s
as
clean
as
shops
are
and
a
damned
sight
cleaner
than
most
a
shop
isn
t
a
and
now
there
s
the
infernal
programme
he
would
have
liked
to
bury
and
forget
the
matter
of
the
programme
but
he
could
not
his
conscience
or
her
fussiness
would
force
him
to
examine
into
it
there
was
no
doubt
that
big
james
was
getting
an
old
man
with
peculiar
pompous
mannerisms
and
a
disposition
towards
impossibilism
big
james
ought
to
have
remembered
in
speaking
to
hilda
that
he
was
speaking
to
the
wife
of
his
employer
that
hilda
should
give
an
order
or
even
make
a
request
direct
was
perhaps
unusual
but
dash
it
you
knew
what
women
were
and
if
that
old
josser
of
a
bachelor
big
james
didn
t
know
what
women
were
so
much
the
worse
for
him
he
should
just
give
big
james
a
hint
he
could
not
have
big
james
making
mischief
between
himself
and
hilda
but
the
coward
would
not
go
straight
to
big
james
he
went
first
up
to
what
had
come
to
be
called
the
litho
room
partly
in
order
to
postpone
big
james
but
partly
also
because
he
had
quite
an
affectionate
proud
interest
in
the
litho
room
in
edwin
s
childhood
this
room
now
stripped
and
soiled
into
a
workshop
had
been
the
of
the
clayhanger
family
and
it
still
showed
the
defect
which
it
had
always
shown
the
window
was
too
small
and
too
near
the
corner
of
the
room
no
transformation
could
render
it
satisfactory
save
a
change
in
the
window
old
darius
clayhanger
had
vaguely
talked
of
altering
the
window
edwin
had
thought
seriously
of
it
but
nothing
had
been
done
edwin
was
continuing
the
very
policy
of
his
father
which
had
so
roused
his
disdain
when
he
was
young
the
policy
of
making
things
do
instead
of
entering
upon
lithography
in
a
manner
bold
logical
and
decisive
he
had
nervously
and
slithered
into
it
thus
at
the
back
of
the
yard
was
a
newsom
machine
in
quarters
too
small
for
it
and
the
apparatus
for
the
preliminary
polishing
of
the
stones
while
up
here
in
the
were
grotesquely
mingled
the
final
polishing
process
and
the
artistic
department
the
artist
who
drew
the
designs
on
the
stone
was
a
german
with
short
fair
hair
and
moustache
a
thick
neck
and
a
changeless
expression
edwin
had
surprisingly
found
him
in
hanbridge
he
was
very
skilled
in
judging
the
amount
of
work
necessary
on
the
stone
to
produce
a
desired
result
on
the
paper
and
very
laborious
without
him
the
nascent
lithographic
trade
could
not
have
prospered
his
wages
were
extremely
moderate
but
they
were
what
he
had
asked
and
in
exchange
for
them
he
gave
his
existence
edwin
liked
to
watch
him
drawing
slavishly
meticulously
endlessly
he
was
absolutely
without
imagination
artistic
feeling
charm
urbanity
or
elasticity
of
any
sort
a
miracle
of
sheer
gruff
positiveness
he
lived
somewhere
in
hanbridge
and
had
once
been
seen
by
edwin
on
a
sunday
afternoon
wheeling
a
perambulator
and
smiling
at
a
young
enceinte
woman
who
held
his
free
arm
an
astounding
sight
which
forced
edwin
to
adjust
his
estimates
he
grimly
called
himself
an
englishman
and
was
legally
entitled
to
do
so
on
this
morning
he
was
drawing
a
ewer
and
basin
for
the
illustrated
catalogue
of
an
earthenware
manufacturer
not
a
very
good
light
murmured
edwin
eh
not
a
very
good
light
no
said
karl
sourly
and
indifferently
bent
over
the
stone
and
breathing
with
calm
regularity
my
eyesight
is
being
behind
a
young
man
in
a
smock
was
industriously
polishing
a
stone
edwin
beheld
with
pleasure
it
was
a
joy
to
think
that
here
was
the
sole
lithography
in
bursley
and
that
his
own
enterprise
had
started
it
nevertheless
he
was
ashamed
too
ashamed
of
his
hesitations
his
his
timidity
and
of
karl
s
impaired
eyesight
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
build
a
proper
works
and
every
reason
why
he
should
the
operation
would
be
remunerative
it
would
set
an
example
it
would
increase
his
prestige
he
grew
resolute
on
the
day
of
the
party
at
the
benbows
he
had
been
and
carefully
inspected
the
plot
of
land
at
shawport
and
yesterday
he
had
made
a
very
low
offer
for
it
if
the
offer
was
refused
he
would
raise
it
he
swore
to
himself
he
would
have
his
works
then
big
james
came
into
the
litho
room
i
was
seeking
ye
sir
said
big
james
majestically
with
a
mysterious
expression
edwin
tried
to
look
at
him
anew
as
it
were
with
hilda
s
eyes
certainly
his
bigness
amounted
now
to
an
enormity
for
proportionately
his
girth
more
than
matched
his
excessive
height
his
apron
descended
from
the
semicircle
of
his
paunch
like
a
vast
grey
wall
the
apron
was
dirty
this
being
saturday
but
it
was
at
any
rate
intact
in
old
days
big
james
and
others
at
critical
moments
of
machining
used
to
tear
strips
off
their
aprons
for
yes
he
was
conceivably
a
grotesque
figure
with
his
spectacles
which
did
not
suit
him
his
heavy
breathing
his
mannerisms
and
his
grandiose
air
of
atlas
supporting
the
moral
world
a
woman
might
be
excused
for
seeing
the
comic
side
of
him
but
surely
he
was
honest
and
loyal
surely
he
was
not
the
adder
that
hilda
with
an
intonation
had
suggested
i
m
coming
said
edwin
rather
curtly
he
felt
just
in
the
humour
for
putting
big
james
straight
still
his
reply
had
not
been
too
curt
for
to
his
staff
he
was
the
opposite
of
a
bully
he
always
scorned
to
take
a
facile
advantage
of
his
power
often
tried
even
to
conceal
his
power
in
the
fiction
that
the
employee
was
one
man
and
himself
merely
another
he
would
be
far
more
devastating
to
his
wife
and
his
sister
than
to
any
employee
but
at
intervals
a
bad
or
careless
workman
had
to
meet
the
blaze
of
his
eye
and
accept
the
lash
of
his
speech
it
s
about
that
little
job
for
the
mistress
sir
said
big
james
in
a
soft
voice
when
they
were
out
on
the
landing
edwin
gave
a
start
the
ageing
man
s
tones
were
so
eager
so
anxiously
loyal
his
emphasis
on
the
word
mistress
conveyed
so
clearly
that
the
mistress
was
a
high
and
glorious
personage
to
serve
whom
was
an
honour
and
a
fearful
honour
the
ageing
man
had
almost
whispered
like
a
boy
glancing
with
jealous
distrust
at
the
shut
door
of
the
room
that
contained
the
german
oh
muttered
edwin
taken
aback
i
set
it
up
myself
said
big
james
and
holding
his
head
very
high
looked
down
at
edwin
under
his
spectacles
why
said
edwin
cautiously
i
thought
you
d
given
clayhanger
the
idea
it
couldn
t
be
done
in
time
bless
ye
sir
not
if
i
know
it
i
intimated
to
her
the
situation
in
which
we
were
placed
with
urgent
jobs
on
hand
as
in
duty
bound
sir
she
being
the
mistress
ye
know
how
slow
i
am
to
give
a
promise
sir
but
not
to
do
it
such
was
not
my
intention
and
as
i
have
said
already
sir
i
ve
set
it
up
myself
and
here
s
a
rough
pull
he
produced
a
piece
of
paper
edwin
s
ancient
affection
for
big
james
grew
indignant
the
old
fellow
was
the
very
mirror
of
loyalty
he
might
be
somewhat
grotesque
and
mannered
upon
occasion
but
he
was
the
soul
of
the
clayhanger
business
he
had
taught
edwin
most
of
what
he
knew
about
both
typesetting
and
machining
it
seemed
not
long
since
that
he
used
to
call
edwin
young
sir
a
to
enter
into
tacit
leagues
with
him
against
the
dangerous
obstinacies
of
his
decaying
father
big
james
had
genuinely
admired
darius
clayhanger
assuredly
he
admired
darius
s
son
not
less
his
fidelity
to
the
dynasty
was
touching
it
was
wistful
the
order
from
the
mistress
had
tremendously
excited
and
flattered
him
in
his
secret
heart
and
yet
hilda
must
call
him
names
must
insinuate
against
his
superb
integrity
must
grossly
misrepresent
his
attitude
to
herself
whatever
in
his
pompous
old
way
he
might
have
said
she
could
not
possibly
have
mistaken
his
anxiety
to
please
her
no
she
had
given
a
false
account
of
their
interview
and
edwin
had
believed
it
edwin
now
swerved
violently
back
to
his
own
original
view
he
firmly
believed
big
james
against
his
wife
he
reflected
how
simple
i
was
to
swallow
all
hilda
said
without
confirmation
i
might
have
known
and
that
he
should
think
such
a
thought
shocked
him
tremendously
the
programme
was
not
satisfactorily
set
up
apart
from
several
mistakes
in
the
spelling
of
proper
names
the
thing
with
its
fancy
types
curious
centring
and
superabundance
of
resembled
more
the
libretto
of
a
primitive
methodist
than
a
programme
of
classical
music
offered
to
refined
dilettanti
on
a
sunday
night
though
edwin
had
endeavoured
to
modernise
big
james
he
had
failed
it
was
perhaps
well
that
he
had
failed
for
the
majority
of
customers
preferred
big
james
s
taste
in
printing
to
edwin
s
he
corrected
the
misspellings
and
removed
a
few
and
then
said
it
s
all
right
but
i
doubt
if
clayhanger
ll
care
for
all
these
fancy
founts
implying
that
it
was
a
pity
of
course
that
big
james
s
fancy
founts
would
not
be
appreciated
at
their
true
value
but
women
were
women
i
should
almost
be
inclined
to
set
it
all
again
in
i
m
sure
she
d
prefer
it
do
you
mind
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
sir
big
james
heartily
concurred
looking
at
his
watch
but
i
must
be
lively
he
conveyed
his
immense
bulk
neatly
and
importantly
down
the
narrow
stairs
iii
edwin
sat
in
his
cubicle
again
his
affection
for
big
james
very
active
how
simple
and
agreeable
it
was
to
be
a
man
among
men
only
the
was
an
organism
fifty
times
as
large
as
the
home
and
it
worked
fifty
times
more
smoothly
no
misunderstandings
no
secrecies
at
any
rate
among
the
chief
persons
concerned
and
a
general
recognition
of
the
principles
of
justice
even
the
had
understood
and
the
by
his
tone
had
admitted
that
he
too
was
worthy
of
blame
the
blame
was
not
overdone
and
had
closed
the
episode
in
a
moment
and
see
with
what
splendid
big
james
despite
the
intense
conservatism
of
old
age
had
accepted
the
wholesale
condemnation
of
his
idea
of
a
programme
the
relations
of
men
were
truly
wonderful
when
you
come
to
think
about
it
and
to
be
at
business
was
a
relief
and
even
a
pleasure
edwin
could
not
remember
having
ever
before
regarded
the
business
as
a
source
of
pleasure
a
youth
he
had
gone
into
it
greatly
against
his
will
and
by
tradition
he
had
supposed
himself
still
to
hate
it
why
had
hilda
misled
him
as
to
big
james
for
she
had
misled
him
yes
she
had
misled
him
what
was
her
motive
what
did
she
think
she
could
gain
by
it
he
was
still
profoundly
disturbed
by
this
deception
why
he
thought
i
can
t
trust
her
i
shall
have
to
be
on
my
guard
i
ve
been
in
the
habit
of
opening
my
mouth
and
swallowing
practically
everything
she
says
his
sense
of
justice
very
sharply
resented
her
perfidy
to
big
james
his
heart
warmed
to
the
defence
of
the
excellent
old
man
what
had
she
got
against
big
james
since
the
day
when
the
enormous
man
had
first
shown
her
over
the
printing
shops
before
their
original
betrothal
a
decade
and
more
ago
he
had
never
treated
her
with
anything
but
an
elaborate
and
sincere
respect
was
she
jealous
of
him
because
of
his
edwin
s
expressed
confidence
in
and
ancient
regard
for
him
and
because
edwin
and
he
had
always
been
good
companions
or
had
she
merely
taken
a
dislike
to
him
a
physical
dislike
edwin
had
noticed
that
some
women
had
a
malicious
detestation
for
some
old
men
especially
when
the
old
men
had
any
touch
of
the
grotesque
or
the
pompous
well
he
should
defend
big
james
against
her
she
should
keep
her
hands
off
big
james
his
sense
of
justice
was
so
powerful
in
that
moment
that
if
he
had
had
to
choose
between
his
wife
and
big
james
he
would
have
chosen
big
james
he
came
out
of
the
cubicle
into
the
shop
and
arranged
his
countenance
so
that
the
clerk
should
suppose
him
to
be
thinking
in
tremendous
concentration
upon
some
complex
problem
of
the
business
and
simultaneously
hilda
passed
up
duck
bank
on
the
way
to
market
she
passed
so
close
to
the
shop
that
she
seemed
to
brush
it
like
a
delicious
exciting
and
exasperating
menace
if
she
turned
her
head
she
could
scarcely
fail
to
see
edwin
near
the
door
of
the
shop
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
she
glided
up
the
slope
steadily
and
implacably
and
even
in
the
distance
of
the
street
her
individuality
showed
itself
mysterious
and
strong
he
could
never
decide
whether
she
was
beautiful
or
not
he
felt
that
she
was
impressive
and
not
to
be
scorned
or
ignored
perhaps
she
was
not
beautiful
certainly
she
was
not
young
she
had
not
the
insipidity
of
the
young
girl
unfulfilled
nor
did
she
inspire
melancholy
like
the
woman
just
beyond
her
prime
the
one
was
going
to
be
the
other
had
been
hilda
was
and
she
had
lived
there
was
in
her
none
of
the
detestable
ignorance
and
innocence
that
for
edwin
spoilt
the
majority
of
women
she
knew
she
was
an
equal
and
a
dangerous
equal
simultaneously
he
felt
that
he
could
crush
and
kill
the
little
thing
and
that
he
must
beware
of
the
powerful
unscrupulous
inscrutable
individuality
and
she
receded
still
higher
up
duck
bank
and
then
turned
round
the
corner
to
the
market
place
and
vanished
and
there
was
a
void
she
would
return
as
she
had
receded
gradually
so
she
would
gradually
approach
the
shop
again
with
her
delicious
exciting
exasperating
menace
and
he
had
a
scheme
for
running
out
to
her
and
with
candour
inviting
her
in
and
explaining
to
her
in
just
the
right
tone
of
that
loyalty
to
herself
simply
hummed
and
buzzed
in
the
shop
and
the
and
that
big
james
worshipped
her
and
that
though
she
was
perfect
in
sagacity
she
had
really
been
mistaken
about
big
james
and
he
had
a
vision
of
her
smiling
kindly
and
frankly
upon
big
james
and
big
james
twisting
upon
his
own
axis
in
joyous
pride
nothing
but
and
candour
was
required
to
produce
this
bliss
but
he
knew
that
he
would
never
run
out
to
her
and
invite
her
to
enter
the
enterprise
was
perilous
to
the
point
of
being
foolhardy
with
a
tone
with
a
hesitation
with
an
undecipherable
pout
she
might
she
would
render
it
absurd
and
then
his
pride
at
that
moment
young
alec
batchgrew
perhaps
then
the
town
s
chief
mooncalf
came
down
duck
bank
in
dazzling
breeches
on
a
superb
grey
horse
and
edwin
went
abruptly
back
to
work
lest
the
noodle
should
rein
in
at
the
shop
door
and
talk
to
him
iv
when
he
returned
home
a
few
minutes
before
the
official
hour
of
one
o
clock
he
heard
women
s
voices
and
laughter
in
the
and
as
he
stood
in
the
hall
fingering
the
thin
little
parcel
of
six
programmes
which
he
had
brought
with
him
the
laughter
overcame
the
voices
and
then
expended
itself
in
shrieks
of
quite
uncontrolled
mirth
the
door
was
half
open
he
stepped
quietly
to
it
the
weather
after
being
thunderous
had
cleared
and
the
part
of
the
near
the
open
window
was
shot
with
rays
of
sunshine
janet
orgreave
all
dressed
in
white
lay
back
in
an
easy
chair
she
was
laughing
and
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
at
the
piano
sat
very
upright
a
seemingly
rather
pert
young
woman
not
laughing
but
smiling
with
arch
sparkling
eyes
fixed
on
the
others
this
was
daisy
marrion
a
cousin
of
tom
orgreave
and
the
next
to
the
last
unmarried
daughter
of
a
large
family
up
at
hillport
standing
by
the
piano
was
a
young
timid
girl
of
about
sixteen
whom
edwin
who
had
not
seen
her
before
guessed
to
be
janet
s
niece
elaine
eldest
daughter
of
janet
s
elder
sister
in
london
elaine
s
approaching
visit
had
been
announced
these
other
two
like
janet
were
in
white
lastly
there
was
hilda
in
grey
with
a
black
hat
laughing
like
a
child
they
are
all
children
he
thought
as
unnoticed
he
watched
them
in
their
bright
fragile
frocks
and
hats
and
in
their
excessive
gaiety
and
in
the
strange
abandon
of
their
gestures
they
are
a
foreign
race
encamped
among
us
men
fancy
women
of
nearly
forty
giggling
with
these
girls
as
janet
and
hilda
are
giggling
he
felt
much
pleasure
in
the
sight
it
could
not
have
happened
in
poor
old
maggie
s
reign
it
was
delicious
it
was
one
of
the
rewards
of
existence
for
the
grace
of
these
creatures
was
surpassing
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
hysterical
and
infantile
he
thought
i
ve
been
taking
women
too
seriously
and
his
heart
lightened
somewhat
elaine
saw
him
first
a
flush
flowed
from
her
cheeks
to
her
neck
her
body
stiffened
she
became
intensely
she
could
not
speak
but
she
leaned
forward
and
gazed
with
a
passion
of
apprehension
at
janet
as
if
murmuring
look
the
enemy
take
care
the
imploring
silent
movement
was
delightful
in
its
gawky
ingenuousness
do
tell
us
some
more
daisy
hilda
implored
weakly
there
is
no
more
said
daisy
and
then
started
oh
clayhanger
how
long
have
you
been
there
he
entered
the
room
yielding
himself
proud
masculine
acutely
aware
of
his
sudden
effect
on
these
girls
for
even
hilda
was
naught
but
a
girl
at
the
moment
and
janet
was
really
a
girl
though
the
presence
of
that
shy
niece
just
awaking
to
her
own
body
and
to
the
world
made
janet
seem
old
in
spite
of
her
slimness
and
of
that
smoothness
of
skin
that
was
due
to
a
tranquil
kind
temperament
the
shy
niece
was
enchantingly
constrained
upon
being
introduced
to
edwin
whom
she
was
enjoined
to
call
uncle
only
yesterday
she
must
have
been
a
child
her
marvellously
clear
complexion
could
not
have
been
imitated
by
any
aunt
or
elder
sister
and
now
perhaps
you
ll
tell
me
what
it
s
all
about
said
edwin
hilda
replied
janet
s
called
about
tennis
it
seems
they
re
sick
of
the
new
hillport
club
i
knew
they
would
be
and
so
next
year
janet
s
having
a
private
club
on
her
lawn
bad
as
it
is
said
janet
where
the
entire
conversation
won
t
be
remarks
by
girls
about
other
girls
frocks
and
remarks
by
men
about
the
rotten
inferiority
of
other
men
this
is
all
very
sound
said
edwin
rather
struck
by
hilda
s
epigrammatic
quality
but
what
i
ask
is
what
were
you
laughing
at
oh
nothing
said
daisy
marrion
very
well
then
said
edwin
going
to
the
door
and
shutting
it
nobody
leaves
this
room
till
i
know
now
niece
elaine
elaine
went
crimson
and
squirmed
on
her
only
recently
hidden
legs
but
she
did
not
speak
tell
him
daisy
said
janet
daisy
sat
still
straighter
it
was
only
about
alec
batchgrew
clayhanger
i
suppose
you
know
him
alec
was
the
youngest
scion
of
the
great
and
detested
plutocratic
family
of
batchgrew
enormously
important
in
his
nineteen
years
yes
i
know
him
said
edwin
i
saw
him
on
his
new
grey
horse
this
morning
his
orse
janet
corrected
they
all
began
to
laugh
again
loudly
he
s
taken
a
terrific
fancy
to
maud
my
kiddie
sister
said
daisy
she
s
sixteen
yesterday
afternoon
at
the
tennis
club
he
said
to
maud
look
ere
i
shall
ride
through
the
town
morning
on
my
orse
while
you
re
all
marketing
i
shan
t
take
any
notice
of
any
of
the
other
girls
but
if
you
bow
to
me
i
ll
take
my
at
off
to
she
imitated
the
batchgrew
intonation
that
s
a
good
tale
said
edwin
calmly
what
a
cuckoo
he
ought
to
be
put
in
a
museum
daisy
made
rather
nervous
by
the
success
of
her
tale
bent
over
the
piano
and
skimmed
pianissimo
and
rapidly
through
the
clytie
waltz
elaine
moved
her
shoulders
to
the
rhythm
janet
said
they
must
go
here
hold
on
a
bit
said
edwin
through
the
light
film
of
music
and
undoing
the
little
parcel
he
handed
one
specimen
of
the
programme
to
hilda
and
another
to
janet
simultaneously
oh
so
my
ideas
are
listened
to
sometimes
murmured
hilda
who
was
however
pleased
a
malicious
and
unjust
remark
he
thought
but
the
next
instant
hilda
said
in
a
quite
friendly
natural
tone
janet
s
going
to
bring
elaine
and
she
says
tom
says
she
is
to
tell
you
that
he
s
coming
whether
he
s
wanted
or
not
daisy
won
t
come
why
asked
edwin
but
quite
perfunctorily
he
knew
that
the
marrions
were
not
interested
in
interesting
music
and
his
design
had
been
to
limit
the
audience
to
enthusiasts
church
answered
daisy
succinctly
come
after
church
she
shook
her
head
and
how
s
the
practising
edwin
enquired
from
janet
pretty
fair
said
she
but
not
so
good
as
this
programme
what
swells
we
are
my
word
hilda
s
idea
said
edwin
generously
your
mother
coming
oh
yes
i
think
so
as
the
visitors
were
leaving
hilda
stopped
janet
don
t
you
think
it
ll
be
better
if
we
have
the
piano
put
over
there
and
all
the
chairs
together
round
here
janet
it
might
be
said
janet
uncertainly
hilda
turned
sharply
to
edwin
there
what
did
i
tell
you
well
he
protested
what
on
earth
do
you
expect
her
to
say
when
you
ask
her
like
that
anyhow
i
may
announce
definitely
that
i
m
not
going
to
have
the
piano
moved
we
ll
try
things
as
they
are
for
a
start
and
then
see
why
if
you
put
all
the
chairs
together
over
there
the
place
ll
look
like
a
blooming
the
comparison
was
a
failure
in
tact
which
he
at
once
recognised
but
could
not
retrieve
hilda
faintly
reddened
and
the
memory
of
her
struggles
as
manageress
of
a
was
harshly
revived
in
her
some
day
i
shall
try
the
piano
over
there
she
said
low
and
edwin
concurred
amiably
all
right
some
day
we
ll
try
it
together
just
to
see
what
it
is
like
the
girls
the
younger
ones
still
giggling
slipped
elegantly
out
of
the
house
one
after
another
dinner
passed
without
incident
v
the
next
day
sunday
edwin
had
a
headache
and
it
was
a
bilious
headache
hence
he
insisted
to
himself
and
to
everyone
that
it
was
not
a
bilious
headache
but
just
one
of
those
plain
headaches
which
sometimes
visit
the
righteous
without
cause
or
excuse
for
he
would
never
accept
the
theory
that
he
had
inherited
his
father
s
digestive
weakness
a
liability
to
colds
he
would
admit
but
not
on
any
account
a
feeble
stomach
hence
further
he
was
obliged
to
pretend
to
eat
as
usual
george
was
rather
that
morning
and
hilda
was
in
a
susceptible
condition
doubtless
due
to
nervousness
occasioned
by
the
novel
responsibilities
of
the
musical
evening
and
a
sabbath
musical
evening
at
that
after
the
one
o
clock
dinner
edwin
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
and
read
and
slept
and
when
he
woke
up
he
felt
better
and
was
sincerely
almost
persuaded
that
his
headache
had
not
been
and
was
not
a
bilious
headache
he
said
to
himself
that
a
short
walk
might
disperse
the
headache
entirely
he
made
one
or
two
trifling
adjustments
in
the
disposition
of
the
furniture
his
own
disposition
of
it
and
immensely
and
indubitably
superior
to
that
so
pertinaciously
advocated
by
hilda
and
then
he
went
out
neither
hilda
nor
george
was
visible
possibly
during
his
rest
they
had
gone
for
a
walk
they
had
fits
of
intimacy
he
walked
in
the
faint
september
sunshine
down
trafalgar
road
into
the
town
except
for
a
few
girls
in
dowdy
finery
and
a
few
heavy
youths
with
their
black
or
trousers
turned
up
round
the
ankles
far
enough
to
show
the
white
cotton
lining
the
street
was
empty
the
devout
at
that
hour
were
either
dozing
at
home
or
engaged
in
sunday
school
work
thousands
of
children
were
concentrated
in
the
hot
sunday
schools
as
he
passed
the
bethesda
chapel
and
school
he
heard
the
voices
of
children
addressing
the
lord
of
the
universe
in
laudatory
and
intercessory
song
near
the
bethesda
chapel
by
the
duke
of
cambridge
vaults
two
men
stood
waiting
their
faces
firm
in
the
sure
knowledge
that
within
three
hours
the
would
again
be
open
thick
smoke
rose
from
the
chimneys
of
several
manufactories
and
thin
smoke
from
the
chimneys
of
many
others
the
scheme
of
a
sunday
musical
evening
in
that
land
presented
itself
to
edwin
as
something
rash
fantastic
and
hopeless
and
yet
solacing
were
it
known
it
could
excite
only
hostility
horror
contempt
or
an
intense
bovine
indifference
chiefly
the
last
breathe
the
name
of
chopin
in
that
land
as
he
climbed
duck
bank
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
for
his
private
key
of
the
shop
which
he
had
brought
with
him
for
not
the
desire
for
fresh
air
but
an
acute
curiosity
as
to
the
answer
to
his
letter
to
the
solicitor
to
the
hall
trustees
making
an
offer
for
the
land
at
shawport
had
sent
him
out
of
the
house
would
the
offer
be
accepted
or
declined
or
would
a
somewhat
higher
sum
be
suggested
the
reply
would
have
been
put
into
the
post
on
saturday
and
was
doubtless
then
lying
in
the
within
the
shop
the
whole
future
seemed
to
be
lying
unopened
in
that
he
penetrated
into
his
own
shop
like
a
thief
for
it
was
not
meet
for
an
important
tradesman
to
be
seen
dallying
with
business
of
a
sunday
afternoon
as
he
went
into
the
interior
he
thought
of
hilda
whom
many
years
earlier
he
had
kissed
in
that
very
same
interior
one
thursday
afternoon
life
appeared
incredible
to
him
and
in
his
wife
he
could
see
almost
no
trace
of
the
girl
he
had
kissed
there
in
the
obscure
shop
there
was
a
fair
quantity
of
letters
in
the
box
the
first
one
he
opened
was
from
a
solicitor
not
the
solicitor
to
the
hall
trustees
but
tom
orgreave
who
announced
to
edwin
clayhanger
esquire
dear
sir
that
his
clients
the
palace
porcelain
company
of
longshaw
felt
compelled
to
call
their
creditors
together
the
palace
porcelain
company
who
had
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
printed
advertising
matter
and
expensive
catalogues
owed
edwin
a
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
it
was
a
blow
and
the
more
so
in
that
it
was
unexpected
did
i
come
messing
down
here
on
a
sunday
afternoon
to
receive
this
sort
of
news
he
bitterly
asked
a
moment
earlier
he
had
not
doubted
the
solvency
of
the
palace
porcelain
company
but
now
he
felt
that
the
company
wouldn
t
pay
two
shillings
in
the
pound
perhaps
not
even
that
as
there
were
the
next
letter
was
an
acceptance
of
his
offer
for
the
shawport
land
the
die
was
cast
then
the
new
works
would
have
to
be
created
lithography
would
increase
in
the
vast
new
enterprise
he
would
be
hampered
by
the
purchase
of
maggie
s
house
he
had
just
made
a
bad
debt
and
he
would
have
hilda
s
capricious
opposition
to
deal
with
he
quitted
the
shop
abruptly
locked
the
door
and
went
back
home
his
mind
very
active
but
undirected
vi
something
unfamiliar
in
the
aspect
of
the
as
glimpsed
through
the
open
door
from
the
hall
drew
him
within
hilda
had
at
last
begun
to
make
it
into
her
room
she
had
brought
an
old
from
upstairs
and
put
it
between
the
fireplace
and
the
window
edwin
thought
doesn
t
she
even
know
the
light
ought
to
fall
over
the
left
shoulder
not
over
the
right
letter
paper
and
envelopes
and
even
stamps
were
visible
and
a
miscellaneous
mass
of
letters
and
bills
had
been
pushed
into
the
space
between
the
flat
of
the
desk
and
the
small
drawers
about
it
there
was
also
an
with
a
cushion
on
it
a
new
hearthrug
that
edwin
neither
recognised
nor
approved
of
several
framed
prints
and
other
oddments
his
own
portrait
still
dominated
the
mantelpiece
but
it
was
now
flanked
by
two
brass
he
thought
if
she
d
ask
me
i
could
have
arranged
it
for
her
much
better
than
that
nevertheless
the
idea
of
her
being
absolute
monarch
of
the
little
room
and
expressing
her
individuality
in
it
and
by
it
both
pleased
and
touched
him
nor
did
he
at
all
resent
the
fact
that
she
had
executed
her
plan
in
secret
she
must
have
been
anxious
to
get
the
room
finished
for
the
musical
evening
thence
he
passed
into
the
and
was
thunderstruck
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
was
utterly
changed
and
the
resemblance
to
a
parlour
after
all
achieved
the
piano
had
crossed
the
room
the
chairs
were
massed
together
in
the
most
ridiculous
way
the
sofa
was
so
placed
as
to
be
almost
useless
his
anger
was
furious
but
cold
the
woman
had
considerable
taste
in
certain
directions
but
she
simply
did
not
understand
the
art
of
fixing
up
a
room
whereas
he
did
each
room
in
the
house
save
her
poor
little
amateurish
or
boudoir
had
been
arranged
by
himself
even
to
small
details
and
well
arranged
everyone
admitted
that
he
had
a
talent
for
interiors
the
house
was
complete
before
she
ever
saw
it
and
he
had
been
responsible
for
it
he
was
not
the
ordinary
inexperienced
ignorant
husband
who
leaves
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
the
missis
interiors
mattered
to
him
they
influenced
his
daily
happiness
the
woman
had
clearly
failed
to
appreciate
the
sacredness
of
the
he
appreciated
it
himself
and
never
altered
anything
without
consulting
her
and
definitely
announcing
his
intention
to
alter
she
probably
didn
t
care
a
fig
for
the
her
conduct
was
inexcusable
it
was
an
attack
on
vital
principles
it
was
an
outrage
doubtless
in
her
scorn
for
the
she
imagined
that
he
would
accept
the
she
was
mistaken
with
astounding
energy
he
set
to
work
to
restore
the
quo
the
vigour
with
which
he
dragged
and
pushed
an
innocent
elephantine
piano
was
marvellous
in
less
than
five
minutes
not
a
trace
remained
of
the
he
thought
this
is
a
queer
start
for
a
musical
evening
but
he
was
triumphant
resolute
and
remorseless
he
would
show
her
a
thing
or
two
in
particular
he
would
show
that
fair
play
had
to
be
practised
in
his
house
then
perceiving
that
his
hands
were
dirty
and
one
finger
bleeding
he
went
majestically
if
somewhat
breathless
upstairs
to
the
bathroom
and
washed
with
care
in
the
glass
he
saw
that
despite
his
exertions
he
was
pale
at
length
he
descended
wondering
where
she
was
where
she
had
hidden
herself
who
had
helped
her
to
move
the
furniture
and
what
exactly
the
upshot
would
be
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
high
emotion
in
which
unflinching
obstinacy
was
shot
through
with
qualms
about
disaster
he
revisited
the
to
survey
his
labours
she
was
there
whence
she
had
sprung
he
knew
not
but
she
was
there
he
caught
sight
of
her
standing
by
the
window
before
entering
the
room
when
he
got
into
the
room
he
saw
that
her
emotional
excitement
far
surpassed
his
own
her
lips
and
her
hands
were
twitching
her
nostrils
dilated
and
contracted
tears
were
in
her
eyes
edwin
she
exclaimed
very
passionately
in
a
thick
voice
quite
unlike
her
usual
clear
tones
as
she
surveyed
the
furniture
this
is
really
too
much
evidently
she
thought
of
nothing
but
her
resentment
no
consideration
other
than
her
outraged
dignity
would
have
affected
her
demeanour
if
a
whole
regiment
of
their
friends
had
been
watching
at
the
door
her
demeanour
would
not
have
altered
the
bedrock
of
her
nature
had
been
reached
it
s
war
this
is
thought
edwin
he
was
afraid
he
was
even
intimidated
by
her
anger
but
he
did
not
lose
his
courage
the
determination
to
fight
for
himself
and
to
see
the
thing
through
no
matter
what
happened
was
not
a
bit
weakened
an
inwardly
feverish
but
outwardly
calm
vindictive
desperation
possessed
him
he
and
she
would
soon
know
who
was
the
stronger
at
the
same
time
he
said
to
himself
i
was
hasty
i
ought
not
to
have
acted
in
such
a
hurry
before
doing
anything
i
ought
to
have
told
her
quietly
that
i
intended
to
have
the
last
word
as
regards
furniture
in
this
house
i
was
within
my
rights
in
acting
at
once
but
it
wasn
t
very
clever
of
me
clumsy
fool
aloud
he
said
with
a
kind
of
snigger
what
s
too
much
hilda
went
on
you
simply
make
me
look
a
fool
in
my
own
house
before
my
own
son
and
the
servants
you
ve
brought
it
on
yourself
said
he
fiercely
if
you
will
do
these
idiotic
things
you
must
take
the
consequences
i
told
you
i
didn
t
want
the
furniture
moved
and
immediately
my
back
s
turned
you
go
and
move
it
i
won
t
have
it
and
so
i
tell
you
straight
you
re
a
brute
she
continued
not
heeding
him
obsessed
by
her
own
wound
you
re
a
brute
she
said
it
with
terrifying
conviction
everybody
knows
it
didn
t
maggie
warn
me
you
re
a
brute
and
a
bully
and
you
do
all
you
can
to
shame
me
in
my
own
house
who
d
think
i
was
supposed
to
be
the
mistress
here
even
in
front
of
my
friends
you
insult
me
don
t
act
like
a
baby
how
do
i
insult
you
talking
about
do
you
think
janet
and
all
of
them
didn
t
notice
it
well
he
said
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
moving
towards
the
door
he
thought
she
s
beaten
she
knows
she
s
got
to
take
it
then
he
said
do
go
altering
furniture
without
consulting
you
do
do
things
behind
your
back
never
that
s
no
reason
why
you
should
try
to
make
me
look
a
fool
in
my
own
house
i
told
ada
how
i
wanted
the
furniture
and
george
and
i
helped
her
and
then
a
moment
afterwards
you
give
them
contrary
orders
what
will
they
think
of
me
naturally
they
ll
think
i
m
not
your
wife
but
your
slave
you
re
a
brute
her
voice
rose
i
didn
t
give
any
orders
i
haven
t
seen
the
damned
servants
and
i
haven
t
seen
george
she
looked
up
suddenly
then
who
moved
the
furniture
i
did
who
helped
you
nobody
helped
me
but
i
was
here
only
a
minute
or
two
since
well
do
you
suppose
it
takes
me
half
a
day
to
move
a
few
sticks
of
furniture
she
was
impressed
by
his
strength
and
his
swiftness
and
apparently
silenced
she
had
thought
that
the
servants
had
been
brought
into
the
affair
you
ought
to
know
perfectly
well
he
proceeded
i
should
never
dream
of
insulting
you
before
the
servants
nobody
s
more
careful
of
your
dignity
than
i
am
i
should
like
to
see
anybody
do
anything
against
your
dignity
while
i
m
here
she
was
still
sobbing
i
think
you
ought
to
apologise
to
me
she
blubbered
yes
i
really
do
why
should
i
apologise
to
you
you
moved
the
furniture
against
my
wish
i
moved
it
against
yours
that
s
all
you
began
i
didn
t
begin
you
want
everything
your
own
way
well
you
won
t
have
it
she
blubbered
once
more
you
ought
to
apologise
to
me
and
then
she
wept
hysterically
he
meditated
sourly
harshly
he
had
conquered
the
furniture
was
as
he
wished
and
it
would
remain
so
the
enemy
was
in
tears
shamed
humiliated
he
had
a
desire
to
restore
her
dignity
partly
because
she
was
his
wife
and
partly
because
he
hated
to
see
any
human
being
beaten
moreover
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
a
tremendous
regard
for
appearances
and
he
felt
fears
for
the
musical
evening
he
could
not
contemplate
the
possibility
of
visitors
perceiving
that
the
host
and
hostess
had
violently
quarrelled
he
would
have
sacrificed
almost
anything
to
the
social
proprieties
and
he
knew
that
hilda
would
not
think
of
them
or
at
any
rate
would
not
think
of
them
effectively
he
did
not
mind
apologising
to
her
if
an
apology
would
give
her
satisfaction
he
was
her
superior
in
moral
force
and
naught
else
mattered
i
don
t
think
i
ought
to
apologise
he
said
with
a
slight
laugh
but
if
you
think
so
i
don
t
mind
apologising
i
apologise
there
he
dropped
into
an
to
him
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
you
see
what
a
magnanimous
chap
i
am
she
tried
to
conceal
her
feelings
but
she
was
pleased
flattered
astonished
her
returned
to
her
rapidly
thank
you
she
murmured
and
added
it
was
the
least
you
could
do
at
her
last
words
he
thought
women
are
incapable
of
being
magnanimous
she
moved
towards
the
door
hilda
he
said
she
stopped
come
here
he
commanded
with
gentle
bluffness
she
wavered
towards
him
come
here
i
tell
you
he
said
again
he
drew
her
down
to
him
all
fluttering
and
sobbing
and
wet
and
kissed
her
kissed
her
several
times
and
then
sitting
on
his
knees
she
kissed
him
but
though
she
mysteriously
signified
forgiveness
she
could
not
smile
she
was
still
far
too
agitated
and
out
of
control
to
be
able
to
smile
the
scene
was
over
the
proprieties
of
the
musical
evening
were
saved
her
broken
body
and
soul
huddled
against
him
were
agreeably
wistful
to
his
triumphant
manliness
but
he
had
had
a
terrible
fright
and
even
now
there
was
a
certain
mere
bravado
in
his
attitude
in
his
heart
he
was
thinking
by
jove
has
it
come
to
this
the
responsibilities
of
the
future
seemed
too
complicated
wearisome
and
overwhelming
the
earthly
career
of
a
bachelor
seemed
almost
heavenly
in
its
wondrous
freedom
etches
etches
the
unexampled
creature
so
recently
the
source
of
ineffable
romance
still
sat
on
his
knees
weighing
them
down
suddenly
he
noticed
that
his
head
ached
very
badly
worse
than
it
had
ached
all
day
vii
the
sunday
musical
evening
beyond
its
artistic
thrills
and
emotional
quality
proved
to
be
exciting
as
a
social
manifestation
those
present
at
it
felt
as
must
feel
russian
conspirators
in
a
back
room
of
some
big
grey
house
of
a
petrograd
suburb
when
the
secret
begins
to
function
before
their
eyes
this
concert
of
profane
harmonies
deliberately
planned
and
pouring
out
through
open
windows
to
affront
the
ears
of
returners
from
church
and
chapel
was
considered
by
its
organisers
as
a
remarkable
event
and
rightly
so
the
clayhanger
house
might
have
been
a
fortress
with
the
standard
of
art
and
freedom
floating
from
a
pole
lashed
to
its
chimney
of
course
everybody
pretended
to
everybody
else
that
the
musical
evening
was
a
quite
ordinary
phenomenon
it
was
a
success
and
a
flashing
success
yet
not
unqualified
the
performers
tertius
ingpen
on
the
piano
on
the
fiddle
and
on
the
clarinet
janet
orgreave
on
the
piano
and
very
timidly
in
a
little
song
by
grieg
tom
orgreave
on
the
piano
and
his
contralto
wife
in
two
famous
and
affecting
songs
by
schumann
and
also
on
the
piano
and
edwin
sick
but
obstinate
as
of
pages
all
did
most
creditably
the
music
was
given
with
ardent
sympathy
and
in
none
of
it
did
any
marked
pause
occur
which
had
not
been
contemplated
by
the
composer
himself
but
abstentions
had
thinned
the
women
among
the
audience
elaine
hill
did
not
come
and
far
more
important
orgreave
did
not
come
her
husband
old
osmond
orgreave
had
not
been
expected
as
of
late
owing
to
the
swift
onset
of
renal
disease
hitherto
treated
by
him
with
some
contempt
he
had
declined
absolutely
to
go
out
at
night
but
edwin
had
counted
on
orgreave
she
simply
sent
word
that
she
did
not
care
to
leave
her
husband
and
that
elaine
was
keeping
her
company
disappointment
keen
but
brief
resulted
edwin
s
severe
sick
headache
was
also
a
drawback
it
did
however
lessen
the
bad
social
effect
of
an
altercation
between
him
and
hilda
in
which
edwin
s
part
was
attributed
to
his
indisposition
this
altercation
arose
out
of
an
irresponsible
suggestion
from
somebody
that
something
else
should
be
played
instead
of
something
else
now
for
edwin
a
programme
was
a
programme
sacred
to
be
executed
regardless
of
every
extrinsic
consideration
and
seeing
that
the
programme
was
printed
edwin
negatived
the
suggestion
instantly
and
the
most
weighty
opinion
in
the
room
agreed
with
him
but
hilda
must
needs
fly
out
why
not
change
it
i
m
sure
it
will
be
better
etc
whereas
she
could
be
sure
of
nothing
of
the
sort
and
was
incompetent
to
offer
an
opinion
and
she
unreasonably
and
unnecessarily
insisted
despite
tertius
ingpen
and
the
change
was
made
it
was
astounding
to
edwin
that
after
the
shattering
scene
of
the
afternoon
she
should
be
so
foolhardy
so
careless
so
obstinate
but
she
was
he
kept
his
resentment
neatly
in
a
little
drawer
in
his
mind
and
glanced
at
it
now
and
then
and
he
thought
of
tertius
ingpen
s
terrible
remark
about
women
at
ingpen
s
first
visit
he
said
to
himself
there
s
a
lot
in
it
no
doubt
about
that
at
the
close
of
the
last
item
two
of
brahms
s
hungarian
dances
for
pianoforte
duet
played
with
truly
electrifying
by
little
wizening
tom
orgreave
and
his
wife
both
tertius
ingpen
and
tom
fussed
consciously
about
the
piano
triumphant
not
knowing
quite
what
to
do
next
and
each
looking
rather
like
a
man
who
has
told
a
good
story
and
in
the
midst
of
the
applause
tries
to
make
out
by
an
affectation
of
casualness
that
the
story
is
nothing
at
all
of
course
said
tom
orgreave
carelessly
and
glancing
at
the
ground
as
he
usually
did
when
speaking
fine
as
those
dances
are
on
the
piano
i
should
prefer
to
hear
them
with
the
fiddle
why
demanded
ingpen
challengingly
because
they
were
written
for
the
fiddle
said
tom
orgreave
with
finality
written
for
the
fiddle
not
a
bit
of
it
with
superiority
outwardly
unruffled
tom
said
pardon
me
brahms
wrote
them
for
joachim
i
ve
heard
him
play
them
so
have
i
said
tertius
ingpen
lightly
but
scornfully
but
they
were
written
originally
for
pianoforte
duet
as
you
played
them
brahms
arranged
them
afterwards
for
joachim
tom
orgreave
shook
under
the
blow
for
in
musical
knowledge
his
supremacy
had
never
been
challenged
in
bleakridge
surely
he
began
weakly
my
dear
fellow
it
is
so
said
ingpen
impatiently
look
it
up
said
edwin
with
false
animation
for
his
head
was
thudding
george
fetch
the
encyclopædia
b
and
j
too
delighted
george
ran
off
he
had
been
examining
johnnie
orgreave
s
watch
and
it
was
to
johnnie
he
delivered
the
encyclopædia
amid
mock
protests
from
his
uncle
edwin
more
than
one
person
had
remarked
the
growing
alliance
between
johnnie
and
young
george
but
the
encyclopædia
gave
no
light
then
the
eldest
swetnam
who
had
come
by
invitation
at
the
last
moment
said
i
m
sure
ingpen
is
right
he
was
not
sure
but
from
the
demeanour
of
the
two
men
he
could
guess
and
he
thought
he
might
as
well
share
the
glory
of
ingpen
s
triumph
the
next
instant
tertius
ingpen
was
sketching
out
future
musical
evenings
at
which
quartets
and
quintets
should
be
performed
he
knew
men
in
the
orchestra
at
the
theatre
royal
hanbridge
he
knew
who
could
be
drilled
and
he
was
quite
certain
that
he
could
get
a
cello
from
this
he
went
on
to
and
in
answer
to
scepticism
about
local
gift
for
music
he
said
that
during
his
visits
of
inspection
to
factories
he
had
heard
spontaneous
that
would
knock
spots
off
the
savoy
chorus
indeed
since
his
return
to
it
ingpen
had
developed
some
appreciation
of
certain
aspects
of
his
native
district
he
said
that
the
kindly
commonsense
with
which
as
an
inspector
he
was
received
on
surpassed
anything
in
the
whole
country
talking
of
you
ll
get
a
letter
from
me
about
the
palace
porcelain
company
tom
orgreave
lifting
his
eyebrows
muttered
to
edwin
with
a
strange
gloomy
constraint
i
ve
had
it
said
edwin
you
ve
got
some
nice
clients
i
must
say
in
a
moment
though
tom
said
not
a
word
more
the
palace
porcelain
company
was
on
the
carpet
to
edwin
s
disgust
he
hated
to
talk
about
a
misfortune
but
others
beside
himself
were
interested
in
the
palace
porcelain
company
and
the
news
of
its
failure
had
boomed
mysteriously
through
the
sabbath
air
of
the
district
hilda
and
janet
were
whispering
together
and
edwin
gazing
at
them
saw
in
them
the
giggling
children
of
the
previous
day
specimens
of
a
foreign
race
encamped
among
the
men
suddenly
hilda
turned
her
head
towards
the
men
and
said
of
course
been
let
in
it
was
a
reference
to
the
palace
porcelain
company
how
ungracious
how
unnecessary
how
unjust
and
somehow
edwin
had
been
fearing
it
and
that
was
really
why
he
had
not
liked
the
turn
of
the
conversation
he
had
been
afraid
of
one
of
her
darts
useless
for
tom
swetnam
to
say
that
a
number
of
business
men
quite
as
keen
as
edwin
had
been
let
in
from
her
disdainful
silence
it
appeared
that
hilda
s
conviction
of
the
unusual
simplicity
of
her
husband
was
impregnable
i
hear
you
ve
got
that
shawport
land
said
johnnie
orgreave
the
mystic
influences
of
music
seemed
to
have
been
overpowered
who
told
ye
asked
edwin
in
a
low
voice
once
more
frightened
of
hilda
young
toby
hall
met
him
at
the
conservative
club
last
night
but
hilda
had
heard
what
land
is
that
she
demanded
curtly
what
land
is
that
johnnie
mimicked
her
it
s
the
land
for
the
new
works
missis
hilda
threw
her
shoulders
back
glaring
at
edwin
with
a
sort
of
outraged
fury
happily
most
of
the
people
present
were
talking
among
themselves
you
never
told
me
she
muttered
he
said
i
only
knew
this
afternoon
her
anger
was
unmistakable
she
was
no
longer
a
fluttering
feminine
wreck
on
his
manly
knee
well
said
janet
orgreave
startlingly
to
him
sorry
i
have
to
go
so
soon
you
aren
t
going
edwin
protested
with
unnatural
loudness
what
about
the
victuals
i
shan
t
touch
em
myself
but
they
must
be
consumed
here
you
and
i
ll
lead
the
way
half
playfully
he
seized
her
arm
she
glanced
at
hilda
uncertainly
edwin
said
hilda
very
curtly
and
severely
don
t
be
so
clumsy
janet
has
to
go
at
once
orgreave
is
very
ill
very
ill
indeed
she
only
came
to
oblige
us
then
she
passionately
kissed
janet
it
was
like
a
thunderclap
in
the
room
johnnie
and
tom
confirmed
the
news
of
the
rest
only
tom
s
wife
and
hilda
knew
janet
had
told
hilda
before
the
music
began
osmond
orgreave
had
been
taken
ill
between
five
and
six
in
the
afternoon
stirling
had
gone
in
at
once
and
pronounced
the
attack
serious
everything
possible
was
done
even
a
nurse
was
obtained
instantly
from
the
clowes
hospital
by
the
station
from
reasons
of
sentiment
if
from
no
other
janet
would
have
stayed
at
home
and
foregone
the
musical
evening
but
those
orgreaves
at
home
had
put
their
heads
together
and
decided
that
janet
should
still
go
because
without
her
the
entire
musical
evening
would
crumble
to
naught
here
was
the
true
reason
of
the
absence
of
orgreave
and
elaine
both
unnecessary
to
the
musical
evening
the
boys
had
come
and
tom
s
wife
had
come
because
even
considered
only
as
an
audience
the
orgreave
contingent
was
almost
essential
to
the
musical
evening
and
so
janet
her
father
s
especial
favourite
and
standby
had
come
and
she
had
played
and
not
a
word
whispered
except
to
hilda
it
was
wondrous
it
was
impressive
all
the
orgreaves
departed
and
the
remnant
of
guests
meditated
in
proud
gratified
silence
upon
the
singular
fortitude
and
heroic
commonsense
that
distinguished
their
part
of
the
world
the
musical
evening
was
dramatically
over
the
refreshments
being
almost
wasted
viii
hilda
was
climbing
on
to
the
chair
in
the
hall
to
put
out
the
light
there
when
she
heard
a
noise
behind
the
closed
door
of
the
kitchen
which
she
had
thought
to
be
empty
she
went
to
the
door
and
pushed
it
violently
open
not
only
was
the
gas
flaring
away
in
an
unauthorised
manner
not
only
were
both
servants
theoretically
in
bed
still
up
capless
and
apronless
and
looking
most
curious
in
unrelieved
black
but
the
adventurous
and
wicked
george
was
surreptitiously
with
them
flattering
them
with
his
aristocratic
companionship
and
eating
out
of
a
dish
with
a
tablespoon
twice
george
had
been
sent
to
bed
once
the
servants
had
been
told
to
go
to
bed
the
worst
of
carnivals
is
that
the
dregs
of
the
population
such
as
george
will
take
advantage
of
them
to
rise
to
the
surface
and
conscienceless
and
mischievous
set
at
defiance
the
conventions
by
which
society
protects
itself
she
merely
glanced
at
george
the
menace
of
her
eyes
was
alarming
his
lower
lip
fell
he
put
down
the
dish
and
spoon
and
slunk
timorously
past
her
on
his
way
upstairs
then
she
said
to
the
servants
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
encouraging
him
go
to
bed
at
once
and
as
they
began
nervously
to
handle
the
things
on
the
table
she
added
more
imperiously
at
once
don
t
keep
me
waiting
i
ll
see
to
all
this
and
they
followed
george
meekly
she
gazed
in
disgust
at
the
general
litter
of
broken
refreshments
symbolising
the
traditional
inefficiency
of
servants
and
extinguished
the
gas
the
three
criminals
were
somewhat
the
victims
of
her
secret
resentment
against
edwin
who
a
mere
martyrised
perambulating
stomach
had
retired
edwin
had
defeated
her
in
the
afternoon
and
all
the
evening
in
the
disposition
of
the
furniture
the
evidence
of
his
victory
had
confronted
her
by
prompt
and
brutal
action
uncharacteristic
of
him
and
therefore
mean
he
had
defeated
her
true
he
had
embraced
and
comforted
her
tears
but
it
was
the
kiss
of
a
conqueror
and
then
on
the
top
of
that
he
had
proved
his
commercial
incompetence
by
making
a
large
bad
debt
and
his
commercial
rashness
by
definitely
adopting
a
scheme
of
whose
extreme
danger
she
was
convinced
one
part
of
her
mind
intellectually
knew
that
he
had
not
wilfully
synchronised
these
events
in
order
to
wound
her
but
another
part
of
her
mind
felt
deeply
that
he
had
she
had
been
staggered
by
the
revelation
that
he
was
definitely
committed
to
the
project
of
lithography
and
the
new
works
not
one
word
about
the
matter
had
he
said
to
her
since
their
altercation
on
the
night
of
the
reception
and
she
had
imagined
that
with
his
usual
indecision
he
was
allowing
it
to
slide
she
scarcely
recognised
her
edwin
now
she
accused
him
of
a
malicious
obstinacy
not
understanding
that
he
was
involved
in
the
great
machine
of
circumstance
and
perhaps
almost
as
much
surprised
as
herself
at
the
movement
of
events
at
any
rate
she
was
being
beaten
once
more
and
her
spirit
rebelled
through
all
the
misfortunes
previous
to
her
marriage
that
spirit
if
occasionally
cowed
had
never
been
broken
she
had
sat
grim
and
fierce
against
even
in
her
time
yes
her
spirit
rebelled
and
the
fact
that
others
had
known
about
the
shawport
land
before
she
knew
made
her
still
more
mutinous
against
destiny
she
looked
round
dazed
at
the
situation
what
the
mild
edwin
defying
and
crushing
her
it
was
scarcely
conceivable
the
tension
of
her
nerves
from
this
cause
only
was
extreme
add
to
it
the
strain
of
the
musical
evening
intensified
by
the
calamity
at
the
orgreaves
a
bell
rang
in
the
kitchen
and
all
the
ganglions
of
her
spinal
column
answered
it
had
edwin
rung
no
it
was
the
pardon
me
said
tertius
ingpen
when
she
opened
but
all
my
friends
soon
learn
how
difficult
it
is
to
get
rid
of
me
come
in
she
said
liking
his
tone
which
flattered
her
by
assuming
her
sense
of
humour
as
i
m
sleeping
at
the
office
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
one
or
two
of
my
musical
instruments
after
all
so
i
came
back
you
ve
been
round
she
asked
meaning
round
to
the
orgreaves
yes
what
is
it
really
well
it
appears
to
be
pericarditis
supervening
on
renal
disease
he
lost
consciousness
you
know
yes
i
know
but
what
is
pericarditis
pericarditis
is
inflammation
of
the
pericardium
and
what
s
the
pericardium
they
both
smiled
faintly
the
pericardium
is
the
membrane
that
encloses
the
heart
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
i
ve
only
just
acquired
this
encyclopædic
knowledge
from
stirling
he
was
there
and
is
it
supposed
to
be
very
dangerous
i
don
t
know
doctors
never
want
to
tell
you
anything
except
what
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
after
a
little
hesitating
pause
they
went
into
the
where
the
lights
were
still
burning
and
the
full
disorder
of
the
musical
evening
persisted
including
the
on
the
carpet
tertius
ingpen
picked
up
his
clarinet
case
took
out
the
instrument
examined
the
mouthpiece
lovingly
and
with
tenderness
laid
it
back
do
sit
down
a
moment
said
hilda
sitting
limply
down
it
s
stifling
isn
t
it
let
me
open
the
window
he
suggested
politely
as
he
returned
from
the
window
he
said
pulling
his
short
beard
it
was
wonderful
how
those
orgreaves
went
through
the
musical
evening
wasn
t
it
makes
you
proud
of
being
english
i
suppose
janet
s
a
great
friend
of
yours
his
enthusiasm
touched
her
and
her
pride
in
janet
quickened
to
it
she
gave
a
deliberate
satisfied
nod
in
reply
to
his
question
she
was
glad
to
be
alone
with
him
in
the
silence
of
the
house
ed
gone
to
bed
he
questioned
after
another
little
pause
already
he
was
calling
her
husband
ed
and
with
an
affectionate
intonation
she
nodded
again
he
stuck
it
out
jolly
well
said
ingpen
still
standing
he
brings
these
attacks
on
himself
said
hilda
with
the
calm
sententiousness
of
a
good
digestion
discussing
a
bad
one
she
was
becoming
pleased
with
herself
with
her
expensive
dress
her
position
her
philosophy
and
her
power
to
hold
the
full
attention
of
this
man
ingpen
replied
looking
steadily
at
her
we
bring
everything
on
ourselves
then
he
smiled
as
a
comrade
to
another
she
shifted
her
pose
a
desire
to
discuss
edwin
with
this
man
grew
in
her
for
she
needed
sympathy
intensely
what
do
you
think
of
this
new
scheme
of
his
she
demanded
somewhat
the
new
works
seems
all
right
but
i
don
t
know
much
about
it
well
i
m
not
so
sure
and
she
exposed
her
theory
of
the
entire
satisfactoriness
of
their
present
situation
of
the
needlessness
of
fresh
risks
and
of
edwin
s
unsuitability
for
enterprise
of
course
he
s
splendid
she
said
but
he
ll
never
push
i
can
look
at
him
quite
impartially
i
mean
in
all
those
things
ingpen
murmured
as
it
were
dreamily
have
you
had
much
experience
of
business
yourself
it
depends
what
you
call
business
i
suppose
you
know
i
used
to
keep
a
she
was
a
little
defiant
no
i
didn
t
know
i
may
have
heard
vaguely
did
you
make
it
pay
it
did
pay
in
the
end
but
not
at
first
any
disasters
she
could
not
decide
whether
she
ought
to
rebuff
the
or
not
his
manner
was
so
objective
so
disinterested
so
innocent
so
disarming
that
in
the
end
she
smiled
uncertainly
raising
her
thick
eyebrows
oh
yes
she
said
bravely
and
who
came
to
the
rescue
ingpen
proceeded
edwin
did
i
see
said
ingpen
still
dreamily
i
believe
you
knew
all
about
it
she
remarked
having
flushed
pardon
me
almost
nothing
of
course
you
take
edwin
s
side
are
we
talking
man
to
man
he
asked
suddenly
in
a
new
tone
most
decidedly
she
rose
to
the
challenge
then
i
ll
tell
you
my
leading
theory
he
said
in
a
soft
polite
voice
the
proper
place
for
women
is
the
harem
mr
ingpen
no
no
he
soothed
her
but
firmly
we
re
talking
man
to
man
i
can
whisper
sweet
nothings
to
you
if
you
prefer
it
but
i
thought
we
were
trying
to
be
honest
i
hold
a
belief
i
state
it
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
hold
that
belief
you
can
persecute
me
for
my
belief
if
you
like
that
s
your
affair
but
surely
you
aren
t
afraid
of
an
idea
if
you
don
t
like
the
mere
word
let
s
call
it
zenana
call
it
the
and
kitchen
so
we
re
to
be
kept
to
our
sphere
now
don
t
be
resentful
naturally
you
re
to
be
kept
to
your
own
sphere
if
edwin
began
dancing
around
in
the
kitchen
you
d
soon
begin
to
talk
about
sphere
you
can
t
have
the
advantages
of
married
life
for
nothing
neither
you
nor
he
but
some
of
you
women
nowadays
seem
to
expect
them
gratis
let
me
tell
you
everything
has
to
be
paid
for
on
this
particular
planet
i
m
a
bachelor
i
ve
often
thought
about
marrying
of
course
i
might
get
married
some
day
you
never
know
your
luck
if
i
do
you
ll
keep
your
wife
in
the
harem
no
doubt
and
she
ll
have
to
accept
without
daring
to
say
a
word
all
the
risks
you
choose
to
take
there
you
are
again
he
said
this
notion
that
marriage
ought
to
be
the
end
of
risks
for
a
woman
is
astonishingly
rife
i
find
very
curious
very
curious
he
seemed
to
address
the
wall
why
it
s
the
beginning
of
them
doesn
t
the
husband
take
risks
he
chooses
his
own
he
doesn
t
have
business
risks
thrust
upon
him
by
his
wife
doesn
t
he
what
about
the
risk
of
finding
himself
tied
for
life
to
an
inefficient
housekeeper
that
s
a
bit
of
a
business
risk
isn
t
it
i
ve
known
more
than
one
man
let
in
for
it
and
you
ve
felt
so
sorry
for
him
no
not
specially
you
must
run
risks
when
you
ve
finished
running
risks
you
re
dead
and
you
ought
to
be
buried
if
i
was
a
wife
i
should
enjoy
running
a
risk
with
my
husband
i
swear
i
shouldn
t
want
to
shut
myself
up
in
a
glass
case
with
him
out
of
all
the
draughts
why
what
are
we
all
alive
for
the
idea
of
the
fineness
of
running
risks
struck
her
as
original
it
challenged
her
courage
and
she
began
to
meditate
yes
she
murmured
so
you
sleep
at
the
office
sometimes
a
certain
elasticity
in
one
s
domestic
arrangements
he
waved
a
hand
seeming
to
himself
lightly
then
quickly
changing
his
mood
he
bent
and
said
but
not
quite
with
the
saccharine
artificiality
of
his
first
visit
rather
with
honest
friendly
sincerity
in
which
were
mingled
both
thanks
and
appreciation
hilda
jumped
up
responsively
and
the
under
his
left
arm
and
the
in
his
left
hand
leaving
the
right
arm
free
ingpen
departed
she
did
not
immediately
go
to
bed
now
that
ingpen
was
gone
she
perceived
that
though
she
had
really
said
little
in
opposition
to
edwin
s
scheme
he
had
at
once
assumed
that
she
was
a
strong
opponent
of
it
hence
she
must
have
shown
her
feelings
far
too
openly
at
the
first
mention
of
the
affair
before
anybody
had
left
this
annoyed
her
also
the
immense
injustice
of
nearly
all
ingpen
s
argument
grew
upon
her
moment
by
moment
she
was
conscious
of
a
grudge
against
him
even
while
greatly
liking
him
but
she
swore
that
she
would
never
show
the
grudge
and
that
he
should
never
suspect
it
to
the
end
she
would
play
a
man
s
part
in
the
discussion
moreover
her
anger
against
edwin
had
not
decreased
nevertheless
a
sort
of
zest
perhaps
an
angry
joy
filled
her
with
novel
and
intoxicating
sensations
let
the
scheme
of
the
new
works
go
forward
let
it
fail
let
it
ruin
them
she
would
stand
in
the
breach
she
would
show
the
whole
world
that
no
ordeal
could
lower
her
head
she
had
had
enough
of
being
the
odalisque
and
the
queen
reclining
on
the
soft
couch
of
security
her
nostrils
scented
life
on
the
wind
then
she
heard
a
door
close
upstairs
and
began
at
last
rapidly
as
it
were
cruelly
to
put
out
the
lights
ix
the
incubus
and
humiliations
of
a
bilious
attack
are
not
eternal
edwin
had
not
retired
very
long
before
the
malignant
phase
of
the
terrible
malady
passed
inevitably
by
phenomena
according
with
all
clinical
experience
into
the
next
phase
and
the
patient
who
from
being
chiefly
a
stomach
had
now
become
chiefly
a
throbbing
head
lay
on
his
pillow
exhausted
but
once
more
capable
of
objective
thought
his
resentment
against
his
wife
on
account
of
her
gratuitous
disbelief
in
his
business
faculty
and
on
account
of
her
interference
in
a
matter
that
did
not
concern
her
flickered
up
into
new
flame
he
was
absolutely
innocent
she
was
absolutely
guilty
no
excuse
existed
or
could
be
invented
for
her
rude
and
wounding
attitude
he
esteemed
tertius
ingpen
bachelor
the
most
fortunate
of
men
women
unjust
dishonourable
unintelligent
unscrupulous
giggling
their
appetite
for
pleasure
was
infantile
and
tigerish
he
had
noticed
it
growing
in
hilda
previous
to
marriage
he
had
regarded
hilda
as
combining
the
best
feminine
with
the
best
masculine
qualities
in
many
ways
she
had
exhibited
the
comforting
straightforward
characteristics
of
the
male
but
since
marriage
her
mental
resemblance
to
a
man
had
diminished
daily
and
now
she
was
the
most
feminine
woman
he
had
ever
met
in
the
unsatisfactory
sense
of
the
word
women
still
the
behaviour
of
janet
and
hilda
during
the
musical
evening
had
been
rather
heroic
impossible
to
dismiss
them
as
being
exclusively
of
the
giggling
race
they
had
decided
to
play
a
part
and
they
had
played
it
with
impressive
fortitude
and
the
house
of
the
orgreaves
was
it
about
to
fall
he
divined
that
it
was
about
to
fall
no
death
had
so
far
occurred
in
the
family
which
had
seemed
to
be
immune
through
decades
and
forever
he
wondered
what
would
have
happened
to
the
house
of
orgreave
in
six
months
time
then
he
went
back
into
the
dark
origins
of
his
bilious
attack
and
then
he
was
at
inexcusable
hilda
again
at
length
he
heard
her
on
the
landing
she
entered
the
bedroom
and
quickly
he
shut
his
eyes
he
felt
unpleasantly
through
his
eyelids
that
she
had
turned
up
the
gas
then
she
was
close
to
him
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
she
asked
him
a
question
calmly
as
to
occurrences
since
his
retirement
he
nodded
an
affirmative
your
forehead
s
all
broken
out
she
said
moving
away
in
a
few
moments
he
was
aware
of
the
delicious
soothing
heavenly
application
to
his
forehead
of
a
handkerchief
drenched
in
eau
de
cologne
and
water
the
compress
descended
upon
his
forehead
with
the
infinite
gentleness
of
an
endearment
and
the
sudden
solace
of
a
reprieve
he
made
faint
inarticulate
noises
the
light
was
extinguished
for
his
ease
he
murmured
weakly
are
you
undressed
already
no
she
said
quietly
i
can
undress
all
right
in
the
dark
he
opened
his
eyes
and
could
dimly
see
her
moving
darkly
about
brushing
her
hair
casting
garments
then
she
came
towards
him
a
vague
whiteness
against
the
gloom
and
bending
felt
for
his
face
and
kissed
him
she
kissed
him
with
superb
and
passionate
violence
she
drew
his
life
out
of
him
and
poured
in
her
own
the
tremendous
kiss
seemed
to
prove
that
there
is
no
difference
between
love
and
hate
it
contained
everything
surrender
defiance
anger
and
tenderness
neither
of
them
spoke
the
kiss
dominated
and
assuaged
him
its
illogicalness
overthrew
him
he
could
never
have
kissed
like
that
under
such
circumstances
it
was
a
high
and
bold
gesture
it
expressed
and
transmitted
confidence
she
had
explained
nothing
justified
nothing
made
no
charge
asked
no
forgiveness
she
had
just
confronted
him
with
one
unarguable
fact
and
it
was
the
only
fact
that
mattered
his
pessimism
about
marriage
lifted
if
his
spirit
was
splendidly
romantic
enough
to
match
hers
marriage
remained
a
feasible
state
and
he
threw
away
logic
and
the
past
and
in
a
magic
vision
saw
that
success
in
marriage
was
an
affair
of
goodwill
and
the
right
tone
with
the
whole
force
of
his
heart
he
determined
to
succeed
in
marriage
and
in
the
mighty
resolve
marriage
presented
itself
to
him
as
really
rather
easy
after
all
chapter
x
the
orgreave
calamity
i
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
that
is
six
days
later
edwin
had
unusually
been
down
to
the
shop
after
dinner
and
he
returned
home
about
four
o
clock
ada
hearing
his
entrance
came
into
the
hall
and
said
please
sir
missis
is
over
at
miss
orgreave
s
and
will
ye
please
go
over
where
s
master
george
in
missis
s
own
room
sir
all
right
the
mistress
s
own
room
was
the
new
nomenclature
adopted
by
the
kitchen
doubtless
under
suggestion
for
the
or
boudoir
edwin
opened
the
door
and
glanced
in
george
apparently
sketching
sat
at
his
mother
s
desk
with
the
light
falling
over
his
right
shoulder
he
looked
up
quickly
in
mother
said
i
could
mother
said
i
could
for
the
theory
of
the
special
sanctity
of
the
boudoir
had
mysteriously
established
itself
in
the
house
during
the
previous
eight
or
ten
days
george
was
well
aware
that
even
edwin
was
not
entitled
to
go
in
and
out
as
he
chose
keep
calm
sonny
said
edwin
teasing
him
with
permissible
and
discreet
curiosity
he
glanced
from
afar
at
the
desk
its
upper
drawers
and
its
obviously
it
was
very
untidy
its
untidiness
gave
him
sardonic
pleasure
because
hilda
was
ever
implying
or
even
stating
that
she
was
a
very
tidy
woman
he
remembered
that
many
years
ago
janet
had
mentioned
orderliness
as
a
trait
of
the
wonderful
girl
hilda
lessways
but
he
did
not
personally
consider
that
she
was
tidy
assuredly
she
by
no
means
reached
his
standard
of
tidiness
which
standard
indeed
she
now
and
then
dismissed
as
also
he
was
sardonically
amused
by
the
air
of
importance
and
busyness
which
she
put
on
when
using
the
desk
and
the
room
her
household
accounts
beheld
at
a
distance
were
his
wicked
joy
he
saw
a
bluish
envelope
lying
untidily
on
the
floor
between
the
desk
and
the
fireplace
and
he
picked
it
up
it
had
been
addressed
to
george
cannon
preston
street
brighton
and
readdressed
in
a
woman
s
hand
to
clayhanger
trafalgar
road
bursley
whether
the
handwriting
of
the
original
address
was
masculine
or
feminine
he
could
not
decide
the
envelope
had
probably
contained
only
a
bill
or
a
circular
nevertheless
he
felt
at
once
inimically
inquisitive
towards
the
envelope
without
quite
knowing
it
he
was
jealous
of
all
hilda
s
past
life
up
to
her
marriage
with
him
after
a
moment
reflecting
that
she
had
made
no
mention
of
a
letter
he
dropped
the
envelope
superciliously
and
it
floated
to
the
ground
i
m
going
to
lane
end
house
he
said
can
i
come
no
ii
the
same
overhanging
spirit
of
a
great
event
which
had
somehow
justified
him
in
being
curt
to
the
boy
rendered
him
and
furtive
as
he
stood
in
the
porch
of
the
orgreaves
waiting
for
the
door
to
open
along
the
drive
that
curved
round
the
oval
lawn
under
the
high
trees
were
still
surviving
from
the
previous
day
the
house
also
survived
the
curtains
in
all
the
windows
and
the
plants
or
the
pieces
of
furniture
between
the
curtains
were
exactly
as
usual
yet
the
solid
building
and
its
contents
had
the
air
of
an
illusion
a
servant
appeared
good
afternoon
selina
he
had
probably
never
before
called
her
by
name
but
his
impelled
him
to
do
uncustomary
things
good
afternoon
sir
said
selina
whose
changeless
attire
ignored
even
the
greatest
events
and
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
ah
sir
to
what
have
we
come
she
too
was
and
furtive
aloud
she
said
miss
orgreave
and
clayhanger
are
upstairs
sir
i
ll
tell
miss
orgreave
coughing
nervously
he
went
into
the
the
large
obscure
room
crowded
with
old
furniture
and
expensive
new
furniture
with
books
knickknacks
embroidery
and
human
history
in
which
he
had
first
set
eyes
on
hilda
it
was
precisely
the
same
as
it
had
been
a
few
days
earlier
absolutely
nothing
had
been
changed
and
yet
now
it
had
the
archæological
and
forlorn
aspect
of
a
museum
he
dreaded
the
appearance
of
janet
and
hilda
what
could
he
say
to
janet
or
she
to
him
but
he
was
a
little
comforted
by
the
fact
that
hilda
had
left
a
message
for
him
to
join
them
on
the
previous
tuesday
osmond
orgreave
had
died
and
within
hours
orgreave
was
dead
also
on
the
friday
they
were
buried
together
the
blinds
were
up
again
the
funereal
horses
with
their
artificially
curved
necks
had
already
dragged
other
corpses
to
the
cemetery
the
town
existed
as
usual
and
the
family
of
orgreave
was
scattered
once
more
marian
the
eldest
daughter
had
not
been
able
to
come
at
all
because
her
husband
was
seriously
alicia
hesketh
the
youngest
daughter
far
away
in
her
large
house
in
devonshire
had
not
been
able
to
come
at
all
because
she
was
hourly
expecting
her
third
child
nor
would
harry
her
husband
leave
her
charlie
the
doctor
at
ealing
had
only
been
able
to
run
down
for
the
funeral
because
his
partner
having
broken
his
leg
the
whole
work
of
the
practice
was
on
his
shoulders
and
tom
the
solicitor
was
in
his
office
exploring
the
financial
side
of
his
father
s
affairs
johnnie
was
in
the
office
of
orgreave
and
sons
busy
with
the
professional
side
of
his
father
s
affairs
jimmie
who
had
made
a
sinister
marriage
was
nobody
knew
precisely
where
tom
s
wife
had
done
what
she
could
and
gone
home
jimmie
s
wife
had
never
appeared
elaine
marian
s
child
was
shopping
at
hanbridge
for
janet
and
janet
remained
among
her
souvenirs
an
epoch
was
finished
and
the
episode
that
concluded
it
in
its
strange
features
and
its
swiftness
resembled
a
vast
hallucination
certain
funerals
will
obsess
a
whole
town
and
the
funeral
of
and
osmond
orgreave
might
have
been
expected
to
do
so
not
only
had
their
deaths
been
almost
simultaneous
but
they
had
been
preceded
by
superficially
similar
symptoms
though
the
husband
had
died
of
pericarditis
following
renal
disease
and
the
wife
of
hyperæmia
of
the
lungs
following
increasingly
frequent
attacks
of
bronchial
catarrh
the
phenomena
had
been
impressive
and
rumour
had
heightened
them
also
osmond
orgreave
for
half
a
century
had
been
an
important
and
celebrated
figure
in
the
town
architecturally
a
large
portion
of
the
new
parts
of
it
were
his
creation
yet
the
funeral
had
not
been
one
of
the
town
s
great
feverish
funerals
true
the
children
would
have
opposed
anything
spectacular
but
had
municipal
opinion
decided
against
the
children
they
would
have
been
compelled
to
yield
again
and
again
prominent
men
in
the
town
had
as
it
were
bought
their
funeral
processions
in
advance
by
the
yard
processions
in
which
their
families
willing
or
not
were
reduced
to
the
rôle
of
stewards
tom
and
janet
however
had
ordained
that
nobody
whatever
beyond
the
family
should
be
invited
to
the
funeral
and
there
had
been
no
sincere
protest
from
outside
the
fact
was
that
osmond
orgreave
had
never
related
himself
to
the
crowd
he
was
not
a
freemason
he
had
never
been
president
of
the
society
for
the
prosecution
of
felons
he
had
never
held
municipal
office
he
had
never
pursued
any
object
but
the
good
of
his
family
he
was
a
particularist
his
charm
was
kept
chiefly
for
his
own
home
and
beneath
the
cordiality
of
his
more
general
connections
there
had
always
been
a
subtle
reservation
on
both
sides
he
was
admired
for
his
cleverness
and
his
distinction
liked
where
he
chose
to
be
liked
but
never
loved
save
by
his
own
kin
further
he
had
a
name
for
being
pretty
sharp
in
business
clients
had
had
prolonged
difficulties
with
him
edwin
himself
among
them
the
town
had
made
up
its
mind
about
osmond
orgreave
and
the
verdict
as
with
most
popular
verdicts
was
roughly
just
so
far
as
it
went
but
unjust
in
its
narrowness
the
laudatory
of
a
column
in
the
and
the
briefer
effusive
notice
in
the
new
morning
paper
both
reflected
for
those
with
perceptions
delicate
enough
to
understand
the
popular
verdict
and
though
edwin
hated
long
funerals
and
the
hysteria
of
a
public
woe
he
had
nevertheless
a
sense
of
disappointment
in
the
circumstances
of
the
final
disappearance
of
osmond
orgreave
the
two
women
entered
the
room
silently
hilda
looked
fierce
and
protective
janet
orgreave
pale
and
in
black
seemed
very
thin
she
did
not
speak
she
gave
a
little
nod
of
greeting
edwin
scarcely
controlling
his
voice
and
his
eyes
murmured
good
afternoon
they
would
not
shake
hands
the
effort
would
have
broken
them
all
remained
standing
uncertainly
edwin
saw
before
him
two
girls
aged
by
the
accumulation
of
experience
janet
though
apparently
healthy
with
her
smooth
fair
skin
was
like
an
old
woman
in
the
shell
of
a
young
one
her
eyes
were
dulled
her
glance
plaintive
her
carriage
slack
the
conscious
wish
to
please
had
left
her
together
with
her
main
excuse
for
being
alive
she
was
over
and
more
and
more
during
the
last
ten
years
she
had
lived
for
her
parents
she
alone
among
all
the
children
had
remained
absolutely
faithful
to
them
to
them
and
to
nobody
else
she
had
been
essential
a
fountain
of
vigour
and
brightness
and
kindliness
from
which
they
drew
to
see
her
in
the
familiar
and
historic
room
which
she
had
humanised
and
illuminated
with
her
very
spirit
was
heartrending
in
a
day
she
had
become
unnecessary
and
shrunk
to
the
unneeded
undesired
virgin
which
in
truth
she
was
she
knew
it
everybody
knew
it
all
the
waves
of
passionate
sympathy
which
hilda
and
edwin
in
their
different
ways
ardently
directed
towards
her
broke
in
vain
upon
that
fact
edwin
thought
and
only
the
other
day
she
was
keen
on
tennis
edwin
said
hilda
don
t
you
think
she
ought
to
come
across
to
our
place
for
a
bit
i
m
sure
it
would
be
better
for
her
not
to
sleep
here
most
decidedly
edwin
answered
only
too
glad
to
agree
heartily
with
his
wife
but
johnnie
janet
objected
pooh
surely
he
can
stay
at
tom
s
and
elaine
she
can
come
with
you
heaps
of
room
for
two
i
couldn
t
leave
the
servants
all
alone
i
really
couldn
t
they
wouldn
t
like
it
janet
persisted
moreover
i
ve
got
to
give
them
notice
edwin
had
to
make
the
motion
of
swallowing
well
said
hilda
obstinately
come
along
now
for
the
evening
anyhow
we
shall
be
by
ourselves
yes
you
must
said
edwin
curtly
i
i
don
t
like
walking
down
the
street
janet
faltered
blushing
you
needn
t
you
can
get
over
the
wall
said
edwin
of
course
you
can
hilda
concurred
just
as
you
are
now
i
ll
tell
selina
she
left
the
room
with
decision
and
the
next
instant
returned
with
a
telegram
in
her
hand
open
it
please
i
can
t
said
janet
hilda
read
mother
and
boy
both
doing
splendidly
harry
janet
dropped
onto
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
i
m
so
glad
i
m
so
glad
she
spluttered
i
can
t
help
it
then
she
jumped
up
wiped
her
eyes
and
smiled
for
a
few
yards
the
clayhanger
and
the
orgreave
properties
were
contiguous
and
separated
by
a
fairly
new
wall
which
after
much
procrastination
on
the
part
of
owners
had
at
last
replaced
an
unsatisfactory
while
selina
put
a
chair
in
position
for
the
ladies
to
stand
on
as
a
preliminary
to
climbing
the
wall
edwin
suddenly
remembered
that
in
the
days
of
the
untidy
janet
had
climbed
a
pair
of
steps
in
order
to
surmount
the
hedge
and
visit
his
garden
he
saw
her
balanced
on
the
steps
and
smiling
and
then
jumping
like
a
child
now
he
preceded
her
and
hilda
on
to
the
wall
and
they
climbed
carefully
and
when
they
were
all
up
selina
handed
him
the
chair
and
he
dropped
it
on
his
own
side
of
the
wall
so
that
they
might
descend
more
easily
be
careful
edwin
be
careful
cried
hilda
neither
pleasantly
nor
unpleasantly
and
as
he
tried
to
read
her
mood
in
her
voice
the
mysterious
and
changeful
undercurrent
of
their
joint
life
bore
rushingly
away
his
sense
of
janet
s
tragedy
and
he
knew
that
no
events
exterior
to
his
marriage
could
ever
overcome
for
long
that
constant
secret
preoccupation
of
his
concerning
hilda
s
mood
iii
when
they
came
into
the
house
ada
met
them
with
zest
and
calamity
in
her
whispering
voice
please
m
and
benbow
are
here
they
re
in
the
they
said
they
d
wait
a
bit
to
see
if
you
came
back
ada
had
foreseen
that
whatever
their
superficially
indifferent
demeanour
as
members
of
the
powerful
ruling
caste
her
master
and
mistress
would
be
struck
all
of
a
heap
by
this
piece
of
news
and
they
were
for
the
benbows
did
not
pay
chance
calls
in
the
arrangement
of
their
lives
every
act
was
neatly
planned
and
foreordained
therefore
this
call
was
formal
and
behind
it
was
an
intention
can
t
see
them
i
can
t
possibly
dear
janet
murmured
as
it
were
intimidated
i
ll
run
back
home
hilda
replied
with
benevolent
firmness
no
you
won
t
come
upstairs
with
me
till
they
re
gone
edwin
you
go
and
see
what
they
re
after
janet
faltered
and
obeyed
and
the
two
women
crept
swiftly
upstairs
they
might
have
been
executing
a
strategic
retirement
from
a
bad
smell
the
instinctive
movement
and
the
manner
were
a
judgment
on
the
ideals
of
the
benbows
so
terrible
and
final
that
even
the
benbows
could
they
have
seen
it
must
have
winced
and
doubted
for
a
moment
their
own
moral
perfection
it
came
to
this
that
the
stricken
fled
from
their
presence
what
they
re
after
edwin
muttered
to
himself
half
resenting
the
phrase
because
clara
was
his
sister
and
though
she
bored
and
exasperated
him
he
could
not
class
her
with
exactly
similar
boring
and
exasperating
women
and
throwing
down
his
cap
he
went
with
false
casual
welcoming
into
the
young
bert
benbow
prodigiously
solemn
and
uncomfortable
in
his
birthday
spectacles
was
with
his
father
and
mother
immense
satisfaction
tempered
by
a
slight
nervousness
gleamed
in
the
eyes
of
the
parents
and
the
demeanour
of
all
three
showed
instantly
that
the
occasion
was
ceremonious
albert
and
clara
could
not
have
been
more
pleased
and
uplifted
had
the
occasion
been
a
mourning
visit
of
commiseration
or
even
a
funeral
the
washed
and
brushed
schoolboy
preoccupied
did
not
take
his
share
in
the
greetings
with
sufficient
spontaneity
and
promptitude
clara
said
gently
shocked
bert
what
do
you
say
to
your
uncle
good
afternoon
uncle
i
should
think
so
indeed
clara
of
course
sprang
at
once
to
the
luscious
first
topic
as
to
a
fruit
how
is
poor
janet
bearing
up
edwin
was
very
characteristically
of
the
five
towns
in
this
he
hated
to
admit
in
the
crisis
itself
that
anything
unusual
was
happening
or
had
just
happened
thus
he
replied
negligently
oh
all
right
as
though
his
opinion
was
that
janet
had
nothing
to
bear
up
against
i
hear
it
was
a
quiet
funeral
said
clara
suggesting
somehow
that
there
must
be
something
sinister
behind
the
quietness
of
the
funeral
yes
said
edwin
didn
t
they
ask
no
well
my
word
there
was
a
silence
save
for
faint
humming
from
albert
and
then
just
as
clara
was
mentioning
her
name
in
rushed
hilda
what
s
the
matter
the
impulsive
hilda
demanded
bluntly
this
gambit
did
not
please
edwin
whose
instinct
was
always
to
pretend
that
nothing
was
the
matter
he
would
have
maintained
as
long
as
anybody
that
the
call
was
a
chance
call
after
a
few
vague
exchanges
clara
coughed
and
said
it
s
really
about
your
george
and
our
bert
haven
t
you
heard
hasn
t
george
said
anything
no
what
clara
looked
at
her
husband
expectantly
and
albert
took
the
grand
male
rôle
i
gather
they
had
a
fight
yesterday
at
school
said
he
the
two
boys
went
to
the
same
school
the
higher
grade
school
at
hanbridge
which
had
dealt
such
a
blow
at
the
ancient
educational
foundations
at
oldcastle
that
their
bert
should
attend
the
same
school
as
george
was
secretly
a
matter
of
pride
to
the
benbows
oh
said
edwin
we
ve
seen
no
gaping
wounds
have
we
hilda
albert
s
face
did
not
relax
you
ve
only
got
to
look
at
bert
s
chin
said
clara
bert
shuffled
under
the
world
s
sudden
gaze
undeniably
there
was
a
small
discoloured
lump
on
his
chin
i
ve
had
it
out
with
bert
albert
continued
severely
i
don
t
know
who
was
in
the
wrong
it
was
about
that
penknife
business
you
know
but
i
m
quite
sure
that
bert
was
not
in
the
right
and
as
he
s
the
older
we
ve
decided
that
he
must
ask
george
s
forgiveness
yes
eagerly
added
clara
tired
of
listening
albert
says
we
can
t
have
quarrels
going
on
like
this
in
the
family
they
haven
t
spoken
friendly
to
each
other
since
that
night
we
were
here
and
it
s
the
manly
thing
for
bert
to
ask
george
s
forgiveness
and
then
they
can
shake
hands
that
s
what
i
say
albert
massively
corroborated
her
edwin
thought
i
suppose
these
people
imagine
they
re
doing
something
rather
fine
whatever
they
imagined
they
were
doing
they
had
made
both
edwin
and
hilda
sheepish
either
of
them
would
have
sacrificed
a
vast
fortune
and
the
lives
of
thousands
of
sunday
school
officers
in
order
to
find
a
dignified
way
of
ridiculing
and
crushing
the
expedition
of
albert
and
clara
but
they
could
think
of
naught
that
was
effective
hilda
asked
somewhat
curtly
but
lamely
where
is
george
he
was
in
your
boudoir
a
minutes
ago
drawing
said
edwin
clara
s
neck
was
elongated
at
the
sound
of
the
word
boudoir
boudoir
said
she
and
edwin
could
in
fancy
hear
her
going
down
trafalgar
road
and
giggling
at
every
did
ye
know
clayhanger
has
a
boudoir
that
s
the
latest
still
he
had
employed
the
word
with
intention
out
of
deliberate
bravado
he
added
explanatory
i
should
suggest
said
albert
that
bert
goes
to
him
in
the
they
ll
settle
it
much
better
by
themselves
he
was
very
pleased
by
this
last
phrase
which
proved
him
a
man
of
the
world
after
all
so
long
as
they
don
t
smash
too
much
furniture
while
they
re
about
it
murmured
edwin
now
bert
my
boy
said
albert
in
the
tone
of
a
father
who
is
also
a
brother
and
as
hilda
was
inactive
bert
stalked
forth
upon
his
mission
of
manliness
smiling
awkwardly
and
blushing
he
closed
the
door
after
him
and
not
one
of
the
adults
dared
to
rise
and
open
it
had
any
luck
with
missing
words
lately
albert
asked
in
a
detached
airy
manner
showing
that
the
affair
was
a
trifle
to
him
to
be
dismissed
from
the
mind
at
will
no
said
edwin
i
ve
been
off
missing
words
lately
of
course
you
have
clara
agreed
with
gravity
all
this
must
have
been
very
trying
to
you
all
albert
s
done
very
well
of
course
i
was
on
politeness
my
boy
said
albert
didn
t
you
know
clara
expressed
surprise
politeness
pounds
nineteen
shillings
per
share
said
albert
tremendously
edwin
appreciatively
whistled
had
the
money
no
cheques
go
out
on
monday
i
believe
of
course
he
added
i
go
in
for
it
scientifically
i
leave
no
chances
i
don
t
i
m
making
a
capital
outlay
of
over
five
pounds
ten
on
next
week
s
competition
and
i
may
tell
you
i
shall
get
it
back
again
interest
at
the
same
moment
bert
the
room
he
s
not
there
said
bert
his
drawing
s
there
but
he
isn
t
this
news
was
adverse
to
the
cause
of
manly
peace
are
you
sure
asked
clara
implying
that
bert
might
not
have
made
a
thorough
search
for
george
in
the
boudoir
hilda
sat
grim
and
silent
he
may
be
upstairs
said
the
weakly
amiable
edwin
hilda
rang
the
bell
with
cold
anger
is
master
george
in
the
house
she
harshly
questioned
ada
no
m
he
went
out
a
bit
since
the
fact
was
that
george
on
hearing
from
the
faithful
ada
of
the
arrival
of
the
benbows
had
retired
through
the
kitchen
and
through
the
into
the
mountainous
country
towards
bleakridge
where
was
practised
on
immense
ah
well
said
albert
undefeated
to
edwin
you
might
tell
him
bert
s
been
up
specially
to
apologise
to
him
oh
and
here
s
that
penknife
he
looked
now
at
hilda
and
producing
tertius
ingpen
s
knife
he
put
it
with
a
flourish
on
the
mantelpiece
i
prefer
it
to
be
on
your
mantelpiece
than
on
ours
he
added
smiling
rather
grandiosely
his
manner
as
a
whole
though
compound
indicated
with
some
clearness
that
while
he
adhered
to
his
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
prayer
he
could
not
allow
his
son
to
accept
from
george
earthly
penknives
alleged
to
have
descended
from
heaven
it
was
a
triumphant
hour
for
albert
benbow
as
he
stood
there
dominating
the
he
perceived
that
in
addition
to
silencing
and
sneaping
the
elder
and
richer
branch
of
the
family
he
was
cutting
a
majestic
figure
in
the
eyes
of
his
own
son
in
an
awful
interval
clara
said
with
a
sweet
bright
smile
by
the
way
albert
don
t
forget
about
what
maggie
asked
you
to
ask
oh
yes
by
the
way
said
albert
maggie
wants
to
know
how
soon
you
can
complete
the
purchase
of
this
house
of
yours
edwin
moved
uneasily
i
don
t
know
he
mumbled
can
you
stump
up
in
a
month
say
the
end
of
october
anyway
at
latest
albert
persisted
and
grew
caustic
you
ve
only
got
to
sell
a
few
of
your
famous
securities
certainly
before
the
end
of
october
hilda
replied
with
impulsive
and
fierce
assurance
edwin
was
amazed
by
this
interference
on
her
part
was
she
incapable
of
learning
from
experience
let
him
employ
the
right
tone
with
absolutely
perfect
skill
marriage
would
still
be
impossible
if
she
meant
to
carry
on
in
this
way
what
did
she
know
about
the
difficulties
of
completing
the
purchase
what
right
had
she
to
put
in
a
word
apparently
so
decisive
such
behaviour
was
unheard
of
she
must
be
mad
nevertheless
he
did
not
yield
to
anger
he
merely
said
feebly
and
querulously
that
s
all
very
well
that
s
all
very
well
but
i
m
not
quite
so
sure
as
all
that
will
she
let
some
of
it
be
on
mortgage
no
she
won
t
said
albert
why
not
because
i
ve
got
a
new
security
for
the
whole
amount
myself
oh
edwin
glanced
at
his
wife
and
his
resentful
eyes
said
there
you
are
all
through
your
infernal
hurry
and
cheek
maggie
s
going
to
lose
eighteen
hundred
pounds
in
a
rotten
investment
i
told
you
albert
would
get
hold
of
that
money
if
he
heard
of
it
and
just
look
at
this
point
albert
who
knew
fairly
well
how
to
draw
an
advantage
from
his
s
characteristic
weaknesses
perceived
suddenly
the
value
of
an
immediate
departure
and
amid
loud
enquiries
of
all
sorts
from
clara
and
magnificent
generalities
from
albert
and
gloomy
stiff
salutations
from
uncomfortable
bert
the
visit
closed
but
destiny
lay
in
wait
at
the
corner
of
the
street
for
albert
benbow
s
pride
precisely
as
the
benbows
were
issuing
from
the
portico
the
being
already
closed
upon
them
the
second
swetnam
son
came
swinging
down
trafalgar
road
he
stopped
raising
his
hat
hallo
benbow
he
said
you
ve
heard
the
news
i
suppose
what
about
missing
word
competitions
it
is
a
fact
that
albert
paled
what
injunction
in
the
high
court
this
morning
all
the
money
s
impounded
pending
a
hearing
as
to
whether
the
competitions
are
illegal
or
not
at
the
very
least
half
of
it
will
go
in
costs
it
s
all
over
with
missing
words
who
told
you
i
ve
had
a
wire
to
stop
me
from
sending
in
for
next
week
s
albert
benbow
gave
an
oath
his
wife
ought
surely
to
have
been
horrorstruck
by
the
word
but
she
did
not
blench
flushing
and
scowling
she
said
what
a
shame
we
ve
sent
ours
in
the
faithful
creature
had
for
days
past
at
odd
moments
been
assisting
her
husband
in
the
dictionary
and
as
a
clerk
and
lo
at
last
confirmation
of
those
absurd
but
persistent
rumours
to
the
effect
that
certain
busybodies
meant
if
they
could
to
stop
missing
word
competitions
on
the
ground
that
they
were
simply
a
crude
appeal
to
the
famous
gambling
instincts
of
mankind
and
especially
of
englishmen
albert
had
rebutted
the
charge
with
virtuous
warmth
insisting
on
the
skill
involved
in
and
insisting
also
on
the
historical
freedom
of
the
institutions
of
his
country
he
maintained
that
it
was
inconceivable
that
any
english
court
of
justice
should
ever
interfere
with
a
pastime
so
innocent
and
so
tonic
for
the
tired
brain
and
though
he
had
had
secret
fears
and
had
been
disturbed
and
even
hurt
by
the
comments
of
a
religious
paper
to
which
he
subscribed
he
would
not
waver
from
his
courageous
and
sensible
english
attitude
now
the
fearful
blow
had
fallen
and
albert
knew
in
his
heart
that
it
was
heaven
s
punishment
for
him
he
turned
to
shut
the
gate
after
him
and
noticed
bert
it
appeared
to
him
that
in
hearing
the
paternal
oath
bert
had
been
guilty
of
a
crime
or
at
least
an
indiscretion
and
he
at
once
began
to
make
bert
suffer
meanwhile
swetnam
had
gone
on
to
spread
the
tale
which
was
to
bring
indignation
and
affliction
into
tens
of
thousands
of
respectable
homes
iv
janet
came
softly
and
timidly
into
the
they
are
gone
she
questioned
i
thought
i
heard
the
yes
thank
goodness
hilda
exclaimed
candidly
disdaining
the
convention
which
edwin
still
had
in
respect
that
a
weakness
in
family
ties
should
never
be
referred
to
beyond
the
confines
of
the
family
save
in
urbane
terms
of
dignity
and
regret
excusing
so
far
as
possible
the
sinner
but
in
this
instance
the
immense
ineptitude
of
the
benbows
had
so
affected
edwin
that
while
objecting
to
his
wife
s
outbreak
he
could
not
help
giving
a
guffaw
which
supported
it
and
all
the
time
he
kept
thinking
to
himself
imagine
that
d
d
pietistic
rascal
dragging
the
miserable
shrimp
up
here
to
apologise
to
george
he
was
ashamed
not
merely
of
his
relatives
but
somehow
of
all
humanity
he
could
scarcely
look
even
a
chair
in
the
face
the
benbows
had
left
behind
them
desolation
and
this
desolation
affected
everything
and
could
be
tasted
on
the
tongue
janet
of
course
instantly
noticed
it
and
felt
that
she
ought
not
to
witness
the
shaming
of
her
friends
moreover
her
existence
now
was
chiefly
an
apology
for
itself
she
said
i
really
think
i
ought
to
go
back
and
see
about
a
meal
for
johnnie
in
case
he
turns
up
nonsense
said
hilda
sharply
with
three
servants
in
the
house
i
suppose
johnnie
won
t
starve
now
just
sit
down
sit
her
tone
softened
my
dear
you
re
worse
than
a
child
tell
edwin
she
put
a
cushion
behind
janet
in
the
easy
chair
and
the
gesture
made
janet
s
eyes
humid
once
more
edwin
had
the
exciting
disquieting
vitalising
sensation
of
being
shut
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
women
not
two
women
but
two
thousand
seemed
to
hem
him
in
with
their
incalculable
impulses
standards
inspirations
janet
wants
to
consult
you
hilda
added
and
even
hilda
appeared
to
regard
him
as
a
strong
saviour
he
thought
after
all
then
i
m
not
the
born
idiot
she
d
like
to
make
out
now
we
re
getting
at
her
real
opinion
of
me
it
s
only
about
father
s
estate
said
janet
why
hasn
t
he
made
a
will
oh
yes
he
made
a
will
over
thirty
years
ago
he
left
everything
to
mother
and
made
her
sole
executor
or
whatever
you
call
it
just
like
him
wasn
t
it
d
you
know
that
he
and
mother
never
had
a
quarrel
nor
anything
near
a
quarrel
well
edwin
nodding
appreciatively
answered
with
an
informed
masculine
air
the
law
provides
for
all
that
tom
will
know
did
your
mother
make
a
will
no
dear
thing
she
would
never
have
dreamt
of
it
then
letters
of
administration
will
have
to
be
taken
out
said
edwin
janet
began
afresh
father
was
talking
of
making
a
new
will
two
or
three
months
ago
he
mentioned
it
to
tom
he
said
he
should
like
you
to
be
one
of
the
executors
he
said
he
would
sooner
have
you
for
an
executor
than
anybody
an
intense
satisfaction
permeated
edwin
that
he
should
have
been
desired
as
an
executor
by
such
an
important
man
as
osmond
orgreave
he
felt
as
though
he
were
receiving
compensation
for
uncounted
detractions
really
said
he
i
expect
tom
will
take
out
letters
of
administration
or
tom
and
johnnie
together
they
ll
make
better
executors
than
i
should
it
doesn
t
seem
to
make
much
difference
who
looks
after
it
and
who
doesn
t
hilda
sharply
interrupted
when
there
s
nothing
to
look
after
nothing
to
look
after
edwin
repeated
nothing
to
look
after
said
hilda
in
a
firm
and
clear
tone
according
to
what
janet
says
but
surely
there
must
be
something
janet
answered
mildly
i
m
afraid
there
isn
t
much
it
was
hilda
who
told
the
tale
the
freehold
of
lane
end
house
belonged
to
the
estate
but
there
were
first
and
second
mortgages
on
it
and
had
been
for
years
debts
had
always
beleaguered
the
orgreave
family
a
year
ago
money
had
apparently
been
fairly
plentiful
but
a
great
deal
had
been
spent
on
jimmie
had
had
money
in
connection
with
his
sinister
marriage
charlie
had
had
money
in
connection
with
his
practice
and
tom
had
enticed
orgreave
into
the
palace
porcelain
company
orgreave
had
given
a
guarantee
to
the
bank
for
an
overdraft
in
exchange
for
debentures
and
shares
in
that
company
the
debentures
were
worthless
and
therefore
the
shares
also
and
the
bank
had
already
given
notice
under
the
guarantee
there
was
an
insurance
policy
one
poor
little
insurance
policy
for
a
thousand
pounds
whose
capital
well
invested
might
produce
an
income
of
twelve
or
fifteen
shillings
a
week
but
even
that
policy
was
lodged
as
security
for
an
overdraft
on
one
of
osmond
s
several
private
banking
accounts
there
were
many
debts
small
to
middling
the
value
of
the
orgreave
architectural
connection
was
excessively
dubious
so
much
of
it
had
depended
upon
osmond
orgreave
himself
the
estate
might
prove
barely
solvent
on
the
other
hand
it
might
prove
insolvent
so
johnnie
who
had
had
it
from
tom
had
told
janet
that
day
and
janet
had
told
hilda
your
father
was
let
in
for
the
palace
porcelain
company
edwin
breathed
with
incredulous
emphasis
on
the
initial
p
s
what
on
earth
was
tom
thinking
of
that
s
what
johnnie
wants
to
know
said
janet
johnnie
was
very
angry
they
ve
had
some
words
about
it
except
for
the
matter
of
the
palace
porcelain
company
edwin
was
not
surprised
at
the
revelations
though
he
tried
to
be
the
more
closely
he
examined
his
attitude
for
years
past
to
the
orgreave
household
structure
the
more
clearly
he
had
to
admit
that
a
suspicion
of
secret
financial
rottenness
had
never
long
been
absent
from
his
mind
not
even
at
the
period
of
renewed
profuseness
a
year
or
two
ago
when
painters
and
paperhangers
had
been
enriched
his
resentment
against
the
deceased
charming
osmond
and
also
against
the
affectionate
and
blandly
confident
mother
was
keen
and
cold
they
had
existed
morally
on
janet
for
many
years
monopolised
her
absorbed
her
aged
her
worn
her
out
done
everything
but
finish
her
and
they
had
made
no
provision
for
her
survival
in
addition
to
being
useless
she
was
defenceless
helpless
penniless
and
old
and
she
shivered
now
that
the
warmth
of
her
parents
affection
was
withdrawn
by
death
you
see
said
janet
father
was
so
transparently
honest
and
generous
edwin
said
nothing
to
this
sincere
outburst
have
you
got
any
money
at
all
janet
asked
hilda
there
s
a
little
household
money
and
by
a
miracle
i
ve
never
spent
the
note
poor
dad
gave
me
on
my
last
birthday
well
said
edwin
sardonically
imaging
that
note
as
a
sole
defence
for
janet
against
the
world
of
course
johnnie
will
have
to
allow
you
something
out
of
the
business
for
one
thing
i
m
sure
he
will
if
he
can
janet
agreed
but
he
says
it
s
going
to
be
rather
tight
he
wants
us
to
clear
out
of
the
house
at
once
take
my
advice
and
don
t
do
it
said
edwin
until
the
house
is
let
or
sold
it
may
as
well
be
occupied
by
you
as
stand
empty
better
in
fact
because
you
ll
look
after
it
right
enough
anyway
said
hilda
as
if
to
imply
that
by
a
marvellous
exception
a
man
had
for
once
in
a
while
said
something
sensible
you
needn
t
use
all
the
house
edwin
proceeded
you
won
t
want
all
the
servants
i
wish
you
d
say
a
word
to
johnnie
breathed
janet
i
ll
say
a
word
to
johnnie
all
right
edwin
answered
loudly
but
it
seems
to
me
it
s
tom
that
wants
talking
to
i
can
t
imagine
what
he
was
doing
to
let
your
father
in
for
that
palace
porcelain
business
it
beats
me
janet
quietly
protested
i
feel
sure
he
thought
it
was
all
right
oh
of
course
said
hilda
bitterly
of
course
they
always
do
think
it
s
all
right
and
here
s
my
husband
just
going
into
one
of
those
big
dangerous
affairs
and
thinks
it
s
all
right
and
nothing
i
can
say
will
stop
him
from
going
into
it
and
he
ll
keep
on
thinking
it
s
all
right
until
it
s
all
wrong
and
we
re
ruined
and
perhaps
me
left
a
widow
with
george
her
lowered
eyes
blazed
at
the
carpet
janet
troubled
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
and
then
with
all
the
tremendous
unconscious
persuasive
force
of
her
victimhood
and
her
mourning
murmured
gently
to
edwin
oh
don
t
run
any
risks
don
t
run
any
risks
edwin
was
staggered
by
the
swift
turn
of
the
conversation
two
thousand
women
hemmed
him
in
more
closely
than
ever
he
could
do
nothing
against
them
except
exercise
an
obstinacy
which
might
be
esteemed
as
merely
brutal
they
were
not
accessible
to
argument
hilda
especially
argument
would
be
received
as
an
outrage
it
would
be
impossible
to
convince
hilda
that
she
had
taken
a
mean
and
disgraceful
advantage
of
him
and
that
he
had
every
right
to
resent
her
behaviour
she
was
righteousness
and
injuredness
personified
she
partook
in
that
moment
of
the
victimhood
of
janet
and
she
baffled
him
he
bit
his
lower
lip
all
that
s
not
the
business
before
the
meeting
he
said
as
lightly
as
he
could
d
you
think
if
i
stepped
down
now
i
should
catch
johnnie
at
the
office
and
all
the
time
while
his
heart
hardened
against
hilda
he
kept
thinking
suppose
i
come
to
smash
janet
had
put
a
fear
in
his
mind
janet
who
in
her
wistfulness
and
her
desolating
ruin
seemed
to
be
like
only
a
little
pile
of
dust
all
that
remained
of
the
magnificent
social
structure
of
a
united
and
numerous
orgreave
family
v
edwin
met
tertius
ingpen
in
the
centre
of
the
town
outside
the
offices
of
orgreave
and
sons
amid
the
commotion
caused
by
the
return
of
uplifted
spectators
from
a
football
match
in
which
the
team
curiously
known
to
the
sporting
world
as
bursley
moorthorne
had
scored
a
broken
leg
and
two
goals
to
nil
hello
ingpen
greeted
him
i
was
thinking
of
looking
in
at
your
place
do
said
edwin
come
up
with
me
now
can
t
why
do
these
ghastly
louts
try
to
walk
over
you
as
if
they
didn
t
see
you
then
in
another
tone
very
quietly
and
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
orgreave
offices
been
in
there
what
a
week
eh
how
are
things
bad
edwin
answered
in
a
word
bad
ingpen
lifted
his
eyebrows
they
turned
away
out
of
the
crowd
up
towards
the
tranquillity
of
the
turnhill
road
they
were
manifestly
glad
to
see
each
other
edwin
had
had
a
satisfactory
interview
with
johnnie
orgreave
satisfactory
in
the
sense
that
johnnie
had
admitted
the
wisdom
of
all
that
edwin
said
and
promised
to
act
on
it
i
ve
just
been
talking
to
young
johnnie
for
his
own
good
said
edwin
and
in
a
moment
with
eagerness
with
that
strange
deep
satisfaction
felt
by
the
carrier
of
disastrous
tidings
he
told
ingpen
all
that
he
knew
of
the
plight
of
janet
orgreave
if
you
ask
me
said
he
i
think
it
s
infamous
infamous
ingpen
repeated
the
word
savagely
there
s
no
word
for
it
what
ll
she
do
well
i
suppose
she
ll
have
to
live
with
johnnie
and
where
will
chris
come
in
then
ingpen
asked
in
a
murmur
chris
hamson
exclaimed
edwin
startled
oh
is
that
affair
still
on
the
carpet
cheerful
outlook
ingpen
pulled
his
beard
anyhow
said
he
johnnie
s
the
most
reliable
of
the
crew
charlie
s
the
most
agreeable
but
johnnie
s
the
most
reliable
i
wouldn
t
like
to
count
much
on
tom
and
as
for
jimmie
well
of
course
i
always
look
on
johnnie
as
a
kid
can
t
help
it
there
s
no
law
against
that
so
long
as
you
don
t
go
and
blub
it
out
to
chris
ingpen
laughed
i
don
t
know
her
you
ought
to
know
her
she
s
an
education
my
boy
i
ve
been
having
a
fair
amount
of
education
lately
said
edwin
only
this
afternoon
i
was
practically
told
that
i
ought
to
give
up
the
idea
of
my
new
works
because
it
has
risks
and
the
palace
porcelain
was
risky
and
janet
hasn
t
a
cent
see
the
point
he
was
obliged
to
talk
about
the
affair
because
it
was
heavily
on
his
mind
a
week
earlier
he
had
persuaded
himself
that
the
success
of
a
marriage
depended
chiefly
on
the
tone
employed
to
each
other
by
the
contracting
parties
but
in
the
disturbing
scene
of
the
afternoon
his
tone
had
come
near
perfection
and
yet
marriage
presented
itself
as
even
more
stupendously
difficult
than
ever
ingpen
s
answering
words
salved
and
strengthened
him
the
sensation
of
being
comprehended
was
delicious
intimacy
progressed
i
say
said
edwin
as
they
parted
you
d
better
not
know
anything
about
all
this
when
you
come
right
you
are
my
boy
their
friendship
seemed
once
more
to
be
suddenly
and
surprisingly
intensified
when
edwin
returned
janet
had
vanished
again
like
an
animal
which
fears
the
hunt
and
whose
shyness
nothing
can
cure
she
had
fled
to
cover
at
the
first
chance
according
to
hilda
she
had
run
home
because
it
had
occurred
to
her
that
she
must
go
through
her
mother
s
wardrobe
and
chest
of
drawers
without
a
moment
s
delay
edwin
s
account
to
his
wife
of
the
interview
with
johnnie
orgreave
was
given
on
a
note
justifiably
triumphant
in
brief
he
had
talked
sense
to
johnnie
and
johnnie
had
been
convicted
and
convinced
hilda
listened
with
respectful
propriety
edwin
said
nothing
as
to
his
encounter
with
tertius
ingpen
partly
from
prudence
and
partly
from
timidity
when
ingpen
arrived
at
the
house
much
earlier
than
he
might
have
been
expected
to
arrive
edwin
was
upstairs
and
on
descending
he
found
his
wife
and
his
friend
chatting
in
low
and
intimate
voices
close
together
in
the
the
gas
had
been
lighted
here
s
ingpen
said
hilda
announcing
a
surprise
how
do
ingpen
how
do
ed
ingpen
did
not
rise
nor
did
they
shake
hands
but
in
the
five
towns
friends
who
have
reached
a
certain
degree
of
intimacy
proudly
omit
the
ceremony
of
handshaking
when
they
meet
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
hilda
to
divine
that
edwin
and
tertius
had
previously
met
that
day
and
apparently
ingpen
had
not
divulged
the
fact
edwin
felt
like
a
plotter
the
conversation
of
course
never
went
far
away
from
the
subject
of
the
orgreaves
and
janet
in
particular
ingpen
s
indignation
at
the
negligence
which
had
left
janet
in
the
lurch
was
more
than
warm
enough
to
satisfy
hilda
whose
grievance
against
the
wicked
carelessness
of
heads
of
families
in
general
seemed
to
be
approaching
expression
again
at
length
she
said
it
s
enough
to
make
every
woman
think
seriously
of
where
she
d
be
if
anything
happened
ingpen
smiled
teasingly
now
you
re
getting
personal
and
what
if
i
am
with
my
headstrong
husband
going
in
for
all
sorts
of
schemes
hilda
s
voice
was
extraordinarily
clear
and
defiant
edwin
nervously
rose
i
ll
just
get
some
cigarettes
he
mumbled
hilda
and
ingpen
scarcely
gave
him
any
attention
already
they
were
exciting
themselves
although
he
knew
that
the
supply
of
cigarettes
was
in
the
he
toured
half
the
house
before
going
there
and
then
lit
the
gas
and
with
strange
deliberation
drew
the
blinds
next
he
rang
the
bell
for
matches
and
having
obtained
them
lit
a
cigarette
when
he
the
ingpen
was
saying
with
terrific
conviction
you
re
quite
wrong
as
i
ve
told
you
before
it
s
your
instinct
that
s
wrong
not
your
head
women
will
do
anything
to
satisfy
their
instincts
simply
anything
they
ll
ruin
your
life
in
order
to
satisfy
their
instincts
yes
even
when
they
know
jolly
well
their
instincts
are
wrong
edwin
thought
well
if
these
two
mean
to
have
a
row
it
s
no
affair
of
mine
but
hilda
seemingly
overfaced
used
a
very
moderate
tone
to
retort
you
re
very
outspoken
tertius
ingpen
answered
firmly
i
m
only
saying
aloud
what
every
man
thinks
mind
every
man
and
how
comes
it
that
know
so
much
about
women
i
ll
tell
you
sometime
said
ingpen
shortly
and
then
smiled
again
edwin
advancing
murmured
here
have
a
cigarette
a
few
moments
later
ingpen
was
sketching
out
a
beethoven
symphony
unaided
on
the
piano
and
holding
his
head
back
to
keep
the
out
of
his
eyes
vi
when
the
hour
struck
for
which
hilda
had
promised
a
sandwich
supper
edwin
and
tertius
ingpen
were
alone
in
the
and
ingpen
was
again
at
the
piano
apparently
absorbed
in
harmonic
inventions
of
his
own
no
further
word
had
been
said
upon
the
subject
of
the
discussion
between
ingpen
and
hilda
on
the
whole
despite
the
reserve
of
hilda
s
demeanour
edwin
considered
that
marriage
at
the
moment
was
fairly
successful
and
the
stream
of
existence
running
in
his
favour
at
five
minutes
after
the
hour
restless
he
got
up
and
said
i
d
better
be
seeing
what
s
happened
to
that
supper
ingpen
nodded
as
in
a
dream
edwin
glanced
into
the
where
the
complete
supper
was
waiting
in
illuminated
silence
and
solitude
then
he
went
to
the
boudoir
there
the
two
candlesticks
from
the
mantelpiece
had
been
put
side
by
side
on
the
desk
and
the
candles
lit
the
figures
of
hilda
and
her
son
hilda
kneeling
held
a
stamped
and
addressed
letter
in
her
hand
the
boy
was
bent
over
the
desk
at
his
drawing
which
his
mother
regarded
edwin
in
his
heart
affectionately
derided
them
for
employing
candles
when
the
gas
would
have
been
so
much
more
effective
he
thought
that
the
use
of
candles
was
just
like
one
of
hilda
s
unforeseeable
caprices
but
in
spite
of
his
secret
derision
he
was
strangely
affected
by
the
group
as
revealed
by
the
wavering
in
the
general
darkness
of
the
room
he
seldom
saw
hilda
and
george
together
neither
of
them
was
very
expansive
and
certainly
he
had
never
seen
hilda
kneeling
by
her
son
s
side
since
a
night
at
the
orgreaves
before
her
marriage
when
george
lay
in
bed
unconscious
and
his
spirit
hesitated
between
earth
and
heaven
he
knew
that
hilda
s
love
for
george
had
in
it
something
of
the
savage
but
lacking
demonstrations
of
it
he
had
been
apt
to
forget
its
importance
in
the
phenomena
of
their
united
existence
kneeling
by
her
son
hilda
had
the
look
of
a
girl
and
the
ingenuousness
of
her
posture
touched
edwin
the
idea
shot
through
his
brain
like
a
star
that
life
was
a
marvellous
thing
as
the
door
had
been
ajar
they
scarcely
heard
him
come
in
george
turned
first
and
then
ada
was
standing
at
the
door
yes
m
oh
ada
just
run
across
with
this
letter
to
the
pillar
will
you
yes
m
you
ve
missed
the
post
you
know
said
edwin
hilda
got
up
slowly
it
doesn
t
matter
only
i
want
it
to
be
in
the
post
as
she
gave
the
letter
to
ada
he
speculated
idly
as
to
the
address
of
the
letter
and
why
she
wanted
it
to
be
in
the
post
anyhow
it
was
characteristic
of
her
to
want
the
thing
to
be
in
the
post
she
would
delay
writing
a
letter
for
days
and
then
having
written
it
be
on
pins
until
it
was
safely
taken
out
of
the
house
and
even
when
the
messenger
returned
she
would
ask
did
you
put
that
letter
in
the
post
ada
had
gone
what
s
he
drawing
this
kid
asked
edwin
genially
nobody
answered
standing
between
his
wife
and
the
boy
he
looked
at
the
paper
the
first
thing
he
noticed
was
some
lettering
achieved
in
an
imitation
of
architect
s
lettering
for
proposed
new
to
be
erected
by
edwin
clayhanger
upon
land
at
shawport
george
edwin
clayhanger
and
on
other
parts
of
the
paper
plan
and
elevation
the
plan
at
a
distance
resembled
the
work
of
a
real
architect
only
when
closely
examined
did
it
reveal
itself
as
a
piece
of
boyish
mimicry
the
elevation
was
not
finished
it
was
upon
this
that
with
intervals
caused
by
the
necessity
of
escaping
from
bores
george
had
been
labouring
all
day
and
here
was
exposed
the
secret
and
the
result
of
his
chumminess
with
johnnie
orgreave
yet
the
boy
had
never
said
a
word
to
edwin
in
explanation
of
that
chumminess
nor
had
johnnie
himself
he
s
been
telling
me
he
s
going
to
be
an
architect
said
hilda
is
this
plan
a
copy
of
johnnie
s
or
is
it
his
own
scheme
asked
edwin
oh
his
own
hilda
answered
with
a
rapidity
and
an
earnestness
which
disclosed
all
her
concealed
pride
in
the
boy
edwin
was
thrilled
he
pored
over
the
plan
making
remarks
and
putting
queries
in
a
dull
tone
but
he
was
so
thrilled
that
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
or
understood
the
replies
to
his
questions
it
seemed
to
him
wondrous
miraculous
overwhelming
that
his
own
disappointed
ambition
to
be
an
architect
should
have
in
his
wife
s
child
who
was
not
his
child
he
was
reconciled
to
being
a
printer
and
indeed
rather
liked
being
a
printer
but
now
all
his
career
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
martyrisation
and
he
passionately
swore
that
such
a
martyrisation
should
not
happen
to
george
george
s
ambition
should
be
nourished
and
forwarded
as
no
boyish
ambition
had
ever
been
nourished
and
forwarded
before
for
a
moment
he
had
a
genuine
conviction
that
george
must
be
a
genius
hilda
behind
the
back
of
proud
silent
george
pulled
edwin
s
face
to
hers
and
kissed
it
and
as
she
kissed
she
gazed
at
edwin
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
saying
have
your
works
i
have
yielded
perhaps
it
is
george
s
plan
that
has
made
me
yield
but
anyhow
i
am
strong
enough
to
yield
and
my
strength
remains
and
edwin
thought
this
woman
is
unique
what
other
woman
could
have
done
that
in
just
that
way
and
in
their
embrace
intensifying
and
complicating
its
significance
were
mingled
the
sensations
of
their
passion
his
triumph
her
surrender
the
mysterious
boy
s
promise
and
their
grief
for
janet
s
tragedy
old
ingpen
s
waiting
for
his
supper

know
said
edwin
tenderly
george
you

i
edwin
sitting
behind
a
glazed
door
with
the
word
private
elaborately
patterned
on
the
glass
heard
through
the
open
window
of
his
own
office
the
voices
of
the
benbow
children
and
their
mother
in
the
street
outside
oh
mother
what
a
big
sign
yes
isn
t
uncle
edwin
a
proud
man
to
have
such
a
big
sign
hsh
it
wasn

up

how
often
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
about
your
i
wonder
if
george
has
come
mother
can
t
ring
the
bell
all
the
children
were
there
with
their
screeching
voices
edwin
wondered
that
rupert
should
have
been
brought
where
was
the
sense
of
showing
a
infant
like
rupert
over
a
but
clara
was
always
like
that
the
difficulty
of
leaving
little
rupert
alone
at
home
did
not
present
itself
to
the
august
uncle
edwin
rose
locked
a
safe
that
was
let
into
the
wall
of
the
room
and
dropped
the
key
into
his
pocket
the
fact
of
the
safe
being
let
into
the
wall
gave
him
as
much
simple
pleasure
as
any
detail
of
the
new
works
it
was
an
idea
of
johnnie
orgreave
s
he
put
a
grey
hat
carelessly
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
hands
in
pockets
walked
into
the
next
and
larger
room
which
was
the
clerks
office
both
these
rooms
had
walls
distempered
in
a
green
tint
and
were
fitted
and
desked
in
pitchpine
their
newness
was
stark
and
yet
in
the
clerks
office
the
irrational
habituating
processes
of
time
were
already
at
work
on
the
painted
iron
mantelpiece
lay
a
dusty
white
tile
brought
as
a
sample
long
before
the
room
was
finished
and
now
without
the
slightest
excuse
for
survival
nevertheless
the
perfunctory
cleaner
lifted
the
tile
on
most
mornings
dusted
underneath
it
and
replaced
it
and
edwin
and
his
staff
saw
it
scores
of
times
daily
and
never
challenged
it
and
gradually
it
was
acquiring
a
prescriptive
right
to
exist
just
where
it
did
and
the
day
was
distant
when
some
inconvenient
reforming
person
would
exclaim
what
s
this
old
tile
doing
here
what
edwin
did
notice
was
that
the
walls
and
desks
showed
marks
and
even
wounds
it
seemed
to
him
somehow
wrong
that
the
brand
new
could
not
remain
forever
brand
new
he
thought
he
would
give
a
mild
reproof
or
warning
to
the
elder
clerk
once
the
in
the
ancient
establishment
at
the
corner
of
duck
bank
and
wedgwood
street
and
then
he
thought
what
s
the
use
and
only
murmured
i
m
not
going
off
the
works
and
he
passed
out
with
his
still
somewhat
gawky
gait
to
the
small
of
the
works
on
the
outer
face
of
the
door
which
he
closed
was
painted
the
word
office
he
had
meant
to
have
the
words
painted
on
that
door
because
they
were
romantic
and
but
when
the
moment
came
to
give
the
order
he
had
quaked
before
such
romance
he
was
afraid
as
usual
of
being
sentimental
and
of
showing
off
and
with
assumed
satire
had
publicly
said
some
chaps
would
stick
as
large
as
life
all
across
the
door
he
now
regretted
his
poltroonery
and
he
regretted
sundry
other
failures
in
courage
connected
with
the
scheme
of
the
works
the
works
existed
but
it
looked
rather
like
other
new
buildings
and
not
very
much
like
the
edifice
he
had
dreamed
it
ought
to
have
been
grander
more
complete
more
dashingly
expensive
more
of
an
exemplar
to
the
slattern
district
he
had
been
he
felt
unduly
influenced
by
the
local
spirit
for
and
his
life
seemed
to
be
a
life
of
a
continual
once
he
used
to
read
studiously
on
tuesday
thursday
and
saturday
evenings
he
seldom
read
now
and
never
with
regularity
scarcely
a
year
ago
he
had
formed
a
beautiful
vague
project
of
being
musical
at
hilda
s
instigation
he
had
bought
a
book
of
musical
criticism
by
hubert
parry
and
hilda
had
swallowed
it
in
three
days
but
he
had
begun
it
and
not
finished
it
and
the
musical
evenings
after
feeble
efforts
to
invigorate
them
had
fainted
and
then
died
on
the
miserable
excuse
that
circumstances
were
not
entirely
favourable
to
them
and
his
marriage
so
marvellous
in
its
romance
during
the
first
days
then
either
his
commonsense
or
his
curtly
silenced
these
weak
depreciations
he
had
wanted
the
woman
and
he
had
won
her
he
had
taken
her
there
she
was
living
in
his
house
bearing
his
name
spending
his
money
the
world
could
not
get
over
that
fact
and
the
carper
in
edwin
s
secret
soul
could
not
get
over
it
either
he
had
said
that
he
would
have
a
new
works
and
with
all
its
faults
and
little
cowardices
there
the
new
works
was
and
moreover
it
had
just
been
assessed
for
municipal
rates
at
a
monstrous
figure
he
had
bought
his
house
and
mortgaged
it
he
had
been
stoical
to
bad
debts
he
had
sold
securities
at
rather
less
than
they
cost
him
he
had
braved
his
redoubtable
wife
and
he
had
got
his
works
his
will
and
naught
else
was
the
magic
wand
that
had
conjured
it
into
existence
the
black
and
gold
sign
that
surmounted
its
blue
roofs
could
be
seen
from
the
top
of
acre
lane
and
half
way
along
shawport
lane
proclaiming
the
progress
of
lithography
and
and
the
name
of
edwin
clayhanger
let
the
borough
put
that
in
its
pipe
and
smoke
it
he
was
well
aware
that
the
borough
felt
pride
in
his
works
and
he
had
orders
more
than
sufficient
to
keep
the
enterprise
handsomely
going
even
in
the
five
towns
initiative
seemed
to
receive
its
reward
life
might
be
as
profoundly
unsatisfactory
as
you
pleased
but
there
was
zest
in
it
the
bell
had
rung
he
opened
the
main
door
and
there
stood
clara
and
her
brood
and
edwin
was
the
magnificent
wonderful
uncle
the
children
entered
with
maternal
precautions
and
recommendations
every
child
was
clean
and
spruce
bert
clumsy
clara
minxlike
amy
heavy
and
benignant
lucy
the
pretty
little
thing
and
rupert
simply
adorable
each
representing
a
separate
and
considerable
effort
of
watchful
care
the
mother
came
last
worn
still
pretty
with
a
slight
dragging
movement
of
the
limbs
in
her
glittering
keen
eyes
were
both
envy
and
naïve
admiration
of
her
brother
what
a
life
thought
edwin
meaning
what
a
narrow
stuffy
struggling
conventional
unlovely
existence
was
the
benbows
he
and
they
lived
in
different
worlds
of
intelligence
nevertheless
he
savoured
the
surpassing
charm
of
rupert
the
goodness
of
amy
the
floral
elegance
of
lucy
and
he
could
appreciate
the
unending
labours
of
that
mother
of
theirs
malicious
though
she
was
he
was
bluff
and
jolly
with
all
of
them
the
new
works
being
fairly
close
to
the
benbow
home
the
family
had
often
come
to
witness
its
gradual
mounting
regarding
the
excursions
as
a
sort
of
picnic
and
now
that
the
imposing
place
was
inaugurated
and
the
signs
up
uncle
edwin
had
been
asked
to
show
them
over
it
in
a
grand
formal
visit
and
he
had
amiably
consented
has
george
come
uncle
edwin
asked
bert
george
had
not
come
a
reconciliation
had
occurred
between
the
cousins
though
by
no
means
at
the
time
nor
in
the
manner
desired
by
albert
they
were
indeed
understood
by
the
benbows
to
be
on
the
most
touching
terms
of
intimacy
which
was
very
satisfactory
to
the
righteousness
of
albert
and
clara
and
george
was
to
have
been
of
the
afternoon
party
but
he
had
not
arrived
edwin
knowing
the
unknowableness
of
george
suspected
trouble
machines
machines
piped
tiny
rupert
to
whom
wondrous
tales
had
been
told
you
ll
see
machines
all
right
said
edwin
promisingly
it
was
not
his
intention
to
proceed
straight
to
the
he
would
never
have
admitted
it
but
his
deliberate
intention
was
to
display
the
works
dramatically
with
the
as
a
culmination
the
truth
was
the
man
was
full
of
secret
tricks
contradicting
avuncular
superior
indifference
he
was
a
mere
boy
he
was
almost
a
he
led
them
through
a
longish
passage
and
up
steps
and
down
steps
steps
which
were
not
yet
hollowed
but
which
would
be
hollowed
into
the
shop
which
was
romantically
obscure
with
a
specially
dark
corner
where
a
little
contraption
was
revolving
all
by
itself
in
the
process
of
smoothing
a
stone
young
clara
stared
at
the
two
workmen
while
the
rest
stared
at
the
contraption
and
edwin
feeling
ridiculously
like
a
lecturer
mumbled
words
of
exposition
and
then
next
after
climbing
some
steps
they
were
in
a
lofty
apartment
with
a
glass
roof
and
tropical
here
lived
two
more
men
including
karl
the
german
bent
in
perspiration
over
desks
and
laboriously
drawing
round
about
were
coloured
designs
and
stones
covered
with
pencilling
and
boards
and
all
sorts
of
sheets
of
paper
and
cardboard
ooh
murmured
bert
much
impressed
by
the
meticulous
of
karl
s
pencil
on
a
stone
and
edwin
said
this
is
the
oh
yes
murmured
clara
vaguely
it
s
very
warm
isn
t
it
none
of
them
except
bert
was
interested
they
gazed
about
dully
uncomprehendingly
absolutely
incurious
machines
rupert
urged
again
come
on
then
said
edwin
going
out
with
assumed
briskness
and
gaiety
at
the
door
stood
tertius
ingpen
preoccupied
and
alert
with
all
the
mien
of
a
factory
inspector
in
full
activity
don
t
mind
me
said
ingpen
i
can
look
after
myself
in
fact
i
prefer
to
at
the
sight
of
an
important
stranger
speaking
familiarly
to
uncle
edwin
all
the
children
save
rupert
grew
stiff
dismal
and
apprehensive
and
clara
looked
about
as
though
she
had
suddenly
discovered
very
interesting
phenomena
in
the
corners
of
the
workshop
my
sister
benbow
ingpen
ingpen
is
her
majesty
s
inspector
of
factories
so
we
must
mind
what
we
re
about
said
edwin
clara
gave
a
bright
quick
smile
as
she
limply
shook
hands
the
sinister
enchantment
which
precedes
social
introduction
was
broken
and
clara
overcome
by
the
extraordinary
chivalry
and
deference
of
ingpen
s
customary
greeting
to
women
decided
that
he
was
a
particularly
polite
man
but
she
reserved
her
general
judgment
on
him
having
several
times
heard
albert
inveigh
against
the
autocratic
unreasonableness
of
this
very
inspector
who
according
to
albert
forgot
that
even
an
employer
had
to
live
and
that
that
which
handicapped
the
employer
could
not
possibly
help
the
workman
in
the
long
run
machines
rupert
insisted
they
all
laughed
the
other
children
laughed
suddenly
and
imitatively
and
an
instant
later
than
the
elders
and
tertius
ingpen
as
he
grasped
the
full
purport
of
the
remark
laughed
more
than
anyone
he
turned
sideways
and
bent
slightly
in
order
to
give
vent
to
his
laughter
which
at
first
noiseless
and
imprisoned
gradually
grew
loud
in
freedom
when
he
had
recovered
he
said
thoughtfully
stroking
his
soft
beard
now
it
would
be
very
interesting
to
know
exactly
what
that
child
understands
by
machines
what
his
mental
picture
of
them
is
very
interesting
has
he
ever
seen
any
no
said
clara
ah
that
makes
it
all
the
more
interesting
ingpen
added
roguishly
i
suppose
you
think
you
do
know
mrs
benbow
clara
smiled
the
smile
of
one
who
is
not
certain
of
having
seen
the
point
it
s
very
hot
in
here
edwin
she
said
glancing
at
the
door
the
family
filed
out
shepherded
by
edwin
i
ll
be
back
in
a
sec
said
he
to
clara
on
the
stairs
and
returned
to
the
ingpen
was
in
apparently
close
conversation
with
karl
yes
murmured
ingpen
thoughtfully
tapping
his
teeth
the
whole
process
is
practically
a
contest
between
grease
and
water
on
the
stone
yes
said
karl
gruffly
but
with
respect
and
edwin
could
almost
see
the
tentacles
of
ingpen
s
mind
feeling
and
tightening
round
a
new
subject
of
knowledge
and
greedily
possessing
it
what
a
contrast
to
the
vacuous
indifference
of
clara
who
was
so
narrowed
by
specialisation
that
she
could
never
apply
her
brain
to
anything
except
the
welfare
and
the
aggrandizement
of
her
family
he
dwelt
sardonically
upon
the
terrible
results
of
family
life
on
the
individual
and
dreamed
of
splendid
freedoms
clayhanger
said
ingpen
in
his
official
manner
turning
the
two
withdrew
to
the
door
invisible
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
could
be
heard
the
family
existing
haven
t
seen
much
of
lithography
eh
said
edwin
in
a
voice
discreetly
restrained
ingpen
ignoring
the
question
murmured
i
say
you
know
this
place
is
much
too
hot
well
said
edwin
what
do
you
expect
in
august
but
what
s
the
object
of
all
that
glass
roof
i
wanted
to
give
em
plenty
of
light
at
the
old
shop
they
hadn
t
enough
and
karl
the
teuton
there
was
always
grumbling
why
didn
t
you
have
some
ventilation
in
the
roof
we
did
think
of
it
but
johnnie
orgreave
said
if
we
did
we
should
never
be
able
to
keep
it
watertight
it
certainly
isn
t
right
as
it
is
said
ingpen
and
our
experience
is
that
these
skylighted
rooms
that
are
too
hot
in
summer
are
too
cold
in
winter
how
should
you
like
to
have
your
private
office
in
here
oh
protested
edwin
it
isn
t
so
bad
as
all
that
ingpen
said
quietly
i
should
suggest
you
think
it
over
i
mean
the
ventilation
but
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
this
shop
here
doesn
t
comply
with
your
confounded
rules
ingpen
answered
that
may
or
may
not
be
but
we
re
entitled
to
make
recommendations
in
any
case
and
i
should
like
you
to
think
this
over
if
you
don
t
mind
i
haven
t
any
thermometer
with
me
but
i
lay
it
s
ninety
degrees
here
if
not
more
in
ingpen
s
urbane
reasonable
tone
there
was
just
a
hint
of
the
potential
might
of
the
whole
organised
kingdom
all
serene
said
edwin
rather
ashamed
of
the
temperature
after
all
and
loyally
responsive
to
ingpen
s
evident
sense
of
duty
which
somehow
surprised
him
he
had
not
chanced
before
to
meet
ingpen
at
work
earthenware
manufactories
were
inspected
once
a
quarter
but
other
factories
only
once
a
year
the
thought
of
the
ameliorating
influence
that
ingpen
must
obviously
be
exerting
all
day
and
every
day
somewhat
clashed
with
and
overset
his
bitter
scepticism
concerning
the
real
value
of
departmental
administrative
government
a
scepticism
based
less
upon
experience
than
upon
the
persuasive
tirades
of
democratic
apostles
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
stairs
and
ingpen
scribbled
in
a
notebook
you
seem
to
take
your
job
seriously
said
edwin
teasing
while
i
m
at
it
did
you
imagine
that
i
d
dropped
into
a
sinecure
considering
that
i
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
three
hundred
and
fifty
potbanks
over
a
thousand
other
factories
and
over
two
thousand
workshops
of
sorts
my
boy
you
should
see
some
of
em
you
should
listen
to
the
excuses
no
wonder
thought
edwin
he
hasn
t
told
me
what
a
fine
and
large
factory
mine
is
still
he
might
have
said
something
all
the
same
perhaps
he
will
when
after
visiting
the
and
glancing
from
afar
at
the
the
party
reached
the
rupert
was
so
affected
by
the
tremendous
din
and
the
confusing
whir
of
huge
machinery
in
motion
that
he
began
to
cry
and
seizing
his
mother
s
hand
pressed
himself
hard
against
her
skirt
the
realisation
of
his
ambition
had
overwhelmed
him
amy
protectingly
took
lucy
s
hand
bert
and
clara
succeeded
in
being
very
casual
in
the
great
lofty
room
there
were
five
large
or
fairly
large
machines
and
a
number
of
small
ones
the
latter
had
chiefly
to
do
with
envelope
and
printing
and
with
bookbinding
and
only
two
of
them
were
in
use
of
the
large
machines
three
were
functioning
the
cylinder
which
had
been
the
pride
of
edwin
s
father
the
historic
old
machine
also
his
father
s
which
had
been
so
called
ever
since
edwin
could
remember
and
which
was
ageless
and
edwin
s
latest
and
most
expensive
purchase
the
smithers
it
was
on
the
guarded
flank
of
the
smithers
close
to
the
that
edwin
halted
his
convoy
the
rest
of
the
immense
shop
with
its
complex
masses
of
metal
revolving
sliding
or
paralysed
its
shabby
figures
of
men
boys
and
girls
shifting
mysteriously
about
its
smell
of
iron
grease
and
humanity
and
its
fearful
racket
was
a
mere
background
for
the
smithers
in
its
moving
might
the
smithers
rose
high
above
the
spectators
and
at
one
end
of
it
higher
even
than
the
top
parts
of
the
machine
was
perched
a
dirty
frowsy
pretty
girl
with
a
sweeping
gesture
of
her
bare
arms
this
girl
took
a
wide
sheet
of
blank
paper
from
a
pile
of
sheets
and
lodged
it
on
the
receiving
rack
whereupon
it
was
whirled
off
caught
into
the
clutches
of
the
machine
turned
reversed
hidden
away
from
sight
among
revolving
rollers
red
and
black
and
finally
thrust
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
machine
where
it
was
picked
up
by
a
dirty
frowsy
girl
not
pretty
smaller
and
younger
than
the
creature
indeed
scarcely
bigger
than
amy
and
now
on
the
sheet
was
printed
four
times
in
red
the
words
knype
mineral
water
mnfg
best
and
cheapest
trademark
clara
screeched
a
question
about
the
trademark
which
was
so
far
invisible
edwin
made
a
sign
to
the
lower
dirty
frowsy
girl
who
respectfully
but
with
extreme
rapidity
handed
him
a
sheet
as
it
came
off
the
machine
and
he
shouted
through
the
roar
in
explanation
that
the
trademark
a
syphon
in
blue
would
be
printed
on
the
same
sheet
later
from
another
stone
and
the
sheets
cut
into
fours
each
quarter
making
a
complete
poster
i
thought
it
must
be
like
that
replied
clara
superiorly
from
childhood
she
had
been
well
accustomed
to
printing
processes
and
it
was
not
her
intention
to
be
perplexed
by
this
lithography
edwin
made
a
gesture
to
hand
back
the
sheet
to
the
but
the
machine
would
not
pause
to
allow
her
to
take
it
she
was
the
slave
of
the
machine
so
long
as
it
functioned
every
second
of
her
existence
was
monopolised
and
no
variation
of
conduct
permissible
the
same
law
applied
to
the
older
girl
up
near
the
ceiling
he
put
the
sheet
in
its
place
himself
and
noticed
that
to
do
so
required
appreciable
care
and
application
of
the
manipulative
faculty
these
girls
and
the
other
girls
at
their
greasy
task
in
the
great
shaking
interior
which
he
had
created
vaguely
worried
him
exactly
similar
girls
were
employed
in
thousands
on
the
and
had
once
been
employed
also
at
the
and
even
in
the
pits
but
until
lately
he
had
not
employed
girls
nor
had
his
father
ever
employed
girls
and
these
girls
so
close
to
him
so
dependent
on
him
so
submissive
so
subjugated
so
soiled
so
vulgar
whose
wages
would
scarcely
have
kept
his
wife
in
boots
and
gloves
gave
rise
to
strange
and
disturbing
sensations
in
his
heart
not
merely
in
regard
to
themselves
but
in
regard
to
the
whole
of
the
workpeople
a
question
obscure
and
lancinating
struck
upwards
through
his
industrial
triumph
and
through
his
importance
in
the
world
a
question
scarcely
articulate
but
which
seemed
to
form
itself
into
the
words
is
it
right
is
what
right
his
father
would
have
snapped
at
him
is
what
right
would
have
respectfully
demanded
big
james
who
had
now
sidled
grandiosely
to
the
smithers
and
was
fussing
among
the
rollers
in
the
rack
neither
of
them
would
have
been
capable
of
comprehending
his
trouble
to
his
father
an
employee
was
an
employee
to
be
hired
as
cheaply
as
possible
and
to
be
exploited
as
completely
as
possible
and
the
attitude
of
big
james
towards
the
underlings
was
precisely
that
of
his
deceased
master
they
would
not
be
unduly
harsh
they
would
often
be
benevolent
but
the
existence
of
any
problem
and
especially
any
fundamental
problem
beyond
the
direct
of
wages
and
work
could
not
conceivably
have
occurred
to
them
after
about
three
quarters
of
a
century
of
taboo
had
now
for
a
dozen
years
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
associations
of
anarchistic
criminals
big
james
was
cautiously
in
favor
of
and
old
darius
clayhanger
in
late
life
had
not
been
a
quite
uncompromising
opponent
of
them
as
for
edwin
he
had
always
in
secret
sympathised
with
them
and
the
whom
he
employed
had
no
grievance
against
him
yet
this
unanswerable
persistent
question
would
pierce
the
complacency
of
edwin
s
prosperity
it
seemed
to
operate
in
a
sort
of
fourth
dimension
few
even
amongst
themselves
would
have
reacted
to
it
but
edwin
lived
with
it
more
and
more
he
was
indeed
getting
used
to
it
though
he
could
not
answer
it
he
could
parry
it
thanks
to
scientific
ideas
obtained
from
darwin
and
spencer
by
the
reflection
that
both
he
and
his
serfs
whatever
their
sex
were
the
almost
blind
agencies
of
a
vast
process
of
evolution
and
this
he
did
exulting
with
pride
sometimes
in
the
sheer
adventure
of
the
affair
and
sharing
his
thoughts
with
none
strange
that
once
and
not
so
many
years
ago
either
he
had
been
tempted
to
sell
the
business
and
live
inert
and
ignobly
secure
on
the
interest
of
invested
moneys
but
even
he
felt
sudden
fears
of
responsibility
they
came
and
went
the
visitors
having
wandered
to
and
fro
staring
trailed
out
of
the
led
by
edwin
a
wide
door
swung
behind
them
and
they
were
in
the
abrupt
startling
peace
of
another
corridor
clara
wiped
rupert
s
eyes
and
he
smiled
like
a
blossom
after
a
storm
the
mother
and
the
uncle
exchanged
awkward
glances
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
say
to
each
other
edwin
could
seldom
think
of
anything
that
he
really
wanted
to
say
to
clara
the
children
were
very
hot
and
weary
of
wonders
well
said
clara
i
suppose
we
d
better
be
moving
on
now
she
had
somewhat
the
air
of
a
about
to
resume
the
immense
labour
of
dragging
a
train
it
s
very
queer
about
george
he
was
to
have
come
with
us
for
tea
oh
was
he
of
course
he
was
clara
replied
sharply
it
was
most
distinctly
arranged
at
this
moment
tertius
ingpen
and
hilda
appeared
together
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
hilda
s
unsmiling
face
seemed
enigmatic
ingpen
was
talking
with
vivacity
edwin
thought
apprehensively
what
s
up
now
what
s
she
doing
here
and
not
george
and
when
the
so
strangely
contrasting
shook
hands
he
thought
is
it
possible
that
albert
looks
on
his
wife
as
something
unpredictable
do
those
two
also
have
moods
and
altercations
and
antagonisms
are
they
always
preoccupied
about
what
they
are
thinking
of
each
other
no
it
s
impossible
their
life
must
be
simply
fiendishly
monotonous
and
clara
s
inferiority
before
the
erect
flashing
individuality
of
hilda
appeared
to
him
despicable
hilda
bent
and
kissed
rupert
lucy
amy
and
young
clara
as
it
were
with
passion
she
was
marvellous
as
she
bent
over
rupert
she
scarcely
looked
at
edwin
ingpen
stood
aside
i
m
very
sorry
said
hilda
perfunctorily
i
had
to
send
george
on
an
errand
to
hanbridge
at
the
last
moment
nothing
more
no
genuine
sign
of
regret
edwin
blamed
her
severely
send
george
on
an
errand
to
hanbridge
that
was
hilda
all
over
why
the
devil
should
she
go
out
of
her
way
to
make
unpleasantness
with
clara
she
knew
quite
well
what
kind
of
a
woman
clara
was
and
that
the
whole
of
clara
s
existence
was
made
up
of
domestic
trifles
each
of
which
was
enormous
for
her
will
he
be
down
to
tea
asked
clara
i
doubt
it
well
another
day
then
clara
gathering
her
offspring
took
leave
at
a
door
in
the
corridor
which
gave
on
to
the
yard
mindful
to
the
last
of
ingpen
s
presence
which
hilda
apparently
now
ignored
she
smiled
sweetly
as
she
went
but
behind
the
smile
edwin
with
regret
and
hilda
with
satisfaction
could
perceive
her
everlasting
grudge
against
their
superior
splendour
even
had
they
sunk
to
indigence
clara
could
never
have
forgiven
edwin
for
having
towards
the
end
of
their
father
s
life
prevented
albert
from
wheedling
a
thousand
pounds
out
of
old
darius
nor
hilda
for
her
occasional
pricking
unanswerable
sarcasms
still
rupert
descending
two
titanic
steps
into
the
yard
clung
to
his
mother
as
to
an
angel
and
errand
to
hanbridge
edwin
asked
himself
mistrustfully
ii
scarcely
a
minute
later
when
edwin
with
hilda
and
ingpen
was
back
at
the
door
of
the
the
office
boy
could
be
seen
voyaging
between
roaring
machines
across
the
room
towards
his
employer
the
office
boy
made
a
sign
of
appeal
and
edwin
answered
with
a
curt
sign
that
the
office
boy
was
to
wait
what
s
that
ye
say
edwin
yelled
in
ingpen
s
ear
ingpen
laughed
and
made
a
trumpet
with
his
hands
i
was
only
wondering
what
your
weekly
running
expenses
are
even
ingpen
was
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
scene
and
edwin
was
pleased
now
after
the
flatness
of
clara
s
inspection
that
he
had
specially
arranged
for
two
of
the
machines
to
be
running
which
strictly
need
not
have
been
running
that
afternoon
he
had
planned
a
spectacular
effect
and
it
had
found
a
good
public
ah
he
hesitated
in
reply
to
ingpen
then
he
saw
hilda
s
face
and
his
face
showed
confusion
and
he
smiled
awkwardly
hilda
had
caught
ingpen
s
question
she
said
nothing
her
expressive
sarcastic
unappeasable
features
seemed
to
say
running
expenses
don
t
mention
them
can
t
you
see
they
must
be
enormous
how
can
he
possibly
make
this
place
pay
it
s
a
gigantic
folly
and
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
after
all
her
secret
attitude
towards
the
new
enterprise
was
unchanged
arguments
facts
figures
persuasions
brutalities
had
been
equally
and
totally
ineffective
and
edwin
thought
she
is
the
bitterest
enemy
i
have
said
ingpen
i
like
that
girl
up
there
on
the
top
of
that
machine
and
doesn
t
she
just
know
where
she
is
what
a
movement
of
the
arms
eh
edwin
nodded
appreciative
and
then
beckoned
to
the
office
boy
what
is
it
please
sir
amps
in
the
office
to
see
you
all
right
he
bawled
casually
but
in
reality
he
was
taken
aback
it
s
auntie
hamps
now
he
said
to
the
other
two
we
shall
soon
have
all
bursley
here
this
afternoon
hilda
raised
her
eyebrows
d
you
know
auntie
hamps
she
grimly
asked
ingpen
her
voice
though
she
scarcely
raised
it
was
plainer
than
the
men
s
when
they
shouted
as
ingpen
shook
his
head
she
added
you
ought
to
edwin
did
not
altogether
care
for
this
public
ridicule
of
a
member
of
the
family
auntie
hamps
though
possibly
a
monster
had
her
qualities
hilda
assuming
the
lead
beckoned
with
a
lift
of
the
head
and
edwin
did
not
care
for
that
either
on
his
works
ingpen
followed
hilda
as
though
to
a
menagerie
auntie
hamps
in
her
black
attire
which
by
virtue
of
its
changeless
style
amounted
to
a
historic
uniform
was
magnificent
in
the
private
office
the
three
found
her
standing
in
wait
tingling
with
vitality
and
importance
and
eagerness
she
watched
carefully
that
edwin
shut
the
door
and
kept
her
eye
not
only
on
the
door
but
also
on
the
open
window
she
received
the
presentation
of
tertius
ingpen
with
grandeur
and
with
high
cordiality
and
she
could
appreciate
even
better
than
clara
the
polished
fealty
of
his
greeting
sit
down
auntie
no
i
won
t
sit
down
i
thought
clara
was
here
i
told
her
i
might
come
if
i
could
spare
a
moment
i
must
say
edwin
she
looked
around
the
small
office
and
seemed
to
be
looking
round
the
whole
works
in
a
superb
glance
you
make
me
proud
of
you
you
make
me
proud
to
be
your
auntie
well
said
edwin
you
can
be
proud
sitting
down
she
smiled
no
i
won
t
sit
down
i
only
just
popped
in
to
catch
clara
i
was
going
to
tea
with
her
and
the
chicks
then
she
lowered
her
voice
i
suppose
you
ve
heard
about
john
orgreave
her
tone
proved
however
that
she
supposed
nothing
of
the
kind
no
what
about
johnnie
he
s
run
away
with
chris
hamson
her
triumph
was
complete
it
was
perhaps
one
of
her
last
triumphs
but
it
counted
among
the
greatest
of
her
career
as
a
watchdog
of
society
the
thing
was
a
major
event
and
the
report
was
convincing
useless
to
protest
never
surely
not
it
can
t
be
true
it
carried
truth
on
its
face
useless
to
demand
sternly
who
told
you
the
news
had
reached
auntie
hamps
through
a
curious
channel
the
stationmaster
at
latchett
heaven
alone
could
say
how
auntie
hamps
came
to
have
relations
with
the
stationmaster
at
latchett
but
you
might
be
sure
that
if
an
elopement
was
to
take
place
from
latchett
station
auntie
hamps
would
by
an
instinctive
prescience
have
had
relations
with
the
for
twenty
years
previously
latchett
was
the
next
station
without
the
least
importance
to
shawport
on
the
line
to
crewe
johnnie
orgreave
had
got
into
the
train
at
shawport
and
chris
had
joined
it
at
latchett
her
house
being
near
by
once
on
the
vast
platforms
of
crewe
the
guilty
couple
would
be
safe
from
curiosity
lost
in
england
like
needles
in
a
haystack
the
flirtation
had
been
afoot
for
over
two
years
but
had
only
been
seriously
talked
about
for
less
than
a
year
chris
did
not
move
much
in
town
circles
she
was
older
than
johnnie
but
she
was
one
of
your
blonde
slim
unfruitful
women
who
under
the
shade
of
a
suitable
are
ageless
chris
was
a
heavy
man
glumpy
as
they
say
down
there
a
moneymaker
in
pots
and
great
on
the
colonial
markets
he
made
journeys
to
america
and
to
australia
his
australian
journey
occupied
usually
about
four
months
he
was
now
on
his
way
back
from
sydney
and
nearly
home
chris
had
not
long
since
inherited
a
moderate
fortune
it
must
have
been
the
fortune
rendering
them
independent
that
had
decided
the
tragic
immoralists
to
abandon
all
for
love
the
time
of
the
abandonment
was
fixed
for
them
by
circumstance
for
it
had
to
occur
before
the
husband
s
return
imagine
the
orgreave
business
left
in
the
hands
of
an
incompetent
irresponsible
like
jimmie
orgreave
and
then
what
of
that
martyr
janet
janet
and
johnnie
had
been
keeping
house
together
a
tiny
house
and
janet
had
had
to
have
an
operation
women
talking
together
said
exactly
what
the
operation
was
but
the
knowledge
was
not
common
the
phrase
have
an
operation
was
enough
in
its
dread
as
a
fact
the
operation
for
calculus
was
not
very
serious
it
had
perfectly
succeeded
and
janet
whom
hilda
had
tenderly
visited
was
to
emerge
from
the
nursing
home
at
knype
vale
within
three
days
could
not
johnnie
and
his
chris
have
waited
until
she
was
no
for
the
husband
was
unpreventibly
approaching
and
romantic
love
must
not
be
baulked
nothing
could
or
should
withstand
romantic
love
janet
had
not
even
been
duly
warned
hilda
had
seen
her
that
very
morning
and
assuredly
she
knew
nothing
then
perhaps
johnnie
would
write
to
her
softly
from
some
gay
seaside
resort
where
he
and
his
leman
were
hiding
their
strong
passion
the
episode
was
shocking
it
was
ruinous
the
pair
could
never
return
even
johnnie
alone
would
never
dare
to
return
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
was
he
not
asked
auntie
hamps
in
bland
sorrow
of
tertius
ingpen
he
was
a
friend
and
a
close
friend
of
all
three
of
them
and
not
only
had
he
outraged
their
feelings
he
had
shamed
them
irretrievably
lowered
their
prestige
they
could
not
look
auntie
hamps
in
the
face
but
auntie
hamps
could
look
them
in
the
face
and
her
glance
charged
with
grief
and
with
satisfaction
said
how
are
the
mighty
fallen
with
their
jaunty
parade
of
irreligion
and
their
musical
evenings
on
sundays
with
the
windows
open
while
folks
are
coming
home
from
chapel
and
there
could
be
no
retort
another
good
man
ruined
by
women
observed
tertius
ingpen
with
a
sigh
stroking
his
beard
hilda
sprang
up
and
all
her
passionate
sympathy
for
janet
and
her
disappointment
and
disgust
with
johnnie
the
victim
of
desire
and
her
dissatisfaction
with
her
husband
and
her
hatred
of
auntie
hamps
blazed
forth
and
devastated
the
unwise
ingpen
as
she
scathingly
replied
ingpen
that
is
a
caddish
thing
to
say
she
despised
convention
she
was
frankly
and
atrociously
rude
and
she
did
not
care
edwin
blushed
tertius
ingpen
blushed
i
m
sorry
said
ingpen
keeping
his
temper
i
think
i
ought
to
have
left
a
little
earlier
ed
hamps
he
bowed
with
extreme
urbanity
to
the
ladies
and
departed
shortly
afterwards
auntie
hamps
also
departed
saying
that
she
must
not
be
late
for
tea
at
dear
clara
s
she
was
secretly
panting
to
disclose
the
whole
situation
to
dear
clara
what
a
scene
had
clara
missed
by
leaving
the
works
too
soon
chapter
xii
dartmoor
i
what
was
that
telegram
you
had
this
afternoon
hilda
the
question
was
on
edwin
s
tongue
as
he
walked
up
acre
lane
from
the
works
by
his
wife
s
side
but
it
did
not
achieve
utterance
a
year
had
passed
since
he
last
walked
up
acre
lane
with
hilda
and
now
of
course
he
recalled
the
anger
of
that
previous
promenade
in
the
interval
he
had
acquired
to
some
extent
the
habit
of
containing
his
curiosity
and
his
criticism
in
the
interval
he
had
triumphed
but
hilda
also
had
consolidated
her
position
so
that
despite
the
increase
of
his
prestige
she
was
still
his
equal
she
seemed
to
take
strength
from
him
in
order
to
maintain
the
struggle
against
him
during
the
final
at
the
works
the
great
the
enormous
problem
in
his
mind
had
been
not
whether
such
and
such
a
plan
of
action
for
janet
s
welfare
in
a
very
grave
crisis
would
be
advisable
but
whether
he
should
demand
an
explanation
from
hilda
of
certain
disquieting
phenomena
in
her
boudoir
in
the
excitement
of
his
indecision
janet
s
tragic
case
scarcely
affected
his
sensibility
for
about
twelve
months
hilda
had
he
knew
been
intermittently
carrying
on
a
correspondence
as
to
which
she
had
said
no
word
to
him
she
did
not
precisely
conceal
it
but
she
failed
to
display
it
lately
so
far
as
his
observation
went
it
had
ceased
and
then
he
had
caught
sight
of
an
orange
in
her
wastepaper
basket
alone
in
the
boudoir
and
glancing
back
cautiously
and
guiltily
at
the
door
he
had
picked
up
the
little
ball
of
paper
and
smoothed
it
out
and
read
the
words
edwin
clayhanger
in
those
days
the
wives
of
even
prominent
business
men
did
not
customarily
receive
such
a
rain
of
telegrams
that
the
delivery
of
a
telegram
would
pass
unmentioned
and
be
forgotten
on
the
contrary
the
delivery
of
a
telegram
was
an
event
in
a
woman
s
life
the
telegram
which
he
had
detected
might
have
been
innocently
negligible
in
forty
different
ways
it
might
for
example
have
been
from
janet
or
about
a
rehearsal
of
the
choral
society
or
from
a
tradesman
at
oldcastle
or
about
rooms
at
the
seaside
but
supposing
that
it
was
not
innocently
negligible
supposing
that
she
was
keeping
a
secret
what
secret
what
conceivable
secret
he
could
conceive
no
secret
yes
he
could
conceive
a
secret
he
had
conceived
and
did
conceive
a
secret
and
his
private
thoughts
elaborated
it
he
had
said
to
himself
at
the
works
i
may
ask
her
as
we
go
home
i
shall
see
but
out
in
the
street
with
the
disturbing
sense
of
her
existence
over
his
shoulder
he
knew
that
he
should
not
ask
her
partly
timidity
and
partly
pride
kept
him
from
asking
he
knew
that
as
a
wise
husband
he
ought
to
ask
he
knew
that
commonsense
was
not
her
strongest
quality
and
that
by
diffidence
he
might
be
inviting
unguessed
future
trouble
but
he
would
not
ask
in
the
great
passionate
war
of
marriage
they
would
draw
thus
apart
defensive
and
watchful
rushing
together
at
intervals
either
to
fight
or
to
kiss
the
heat
of
their
kisses
had
not
cooled
but
to
him
at
any
rate
the
kisses
often
seemed
intensely
illogical
for
though
he
regarded
himself
as
an
improving
expert
in
the
science
of
life
he
had
not
yet
begun
to
perceive
that
those
kisses
were
the
only
true
logic
of
their
joint
career
he
was
conscious
of
grievances
against
her
as
they
walked
up
acre
lane
but
instead
of
being
angrily
resentful
he
was
content
judicially
to
register
the
grievances
as
further
corroboration
of
his
estimate
of
her
character
they
were
walking
up
acre
lane
solely
because
hilda
was
hilda
a
year
ago
they
had
walked
up
acre
lane
in
order
that
edwin
might
call
at
the
shop
but
acre
lane
was
by
no
means
on
the
shortest
way
from
shawport
to
bleakridge
hilda
however
on
emerging
from
the
works
full
of
trouble
concerning
janet
had
suddenly
had
the
beautiful
idea
of
buying
some
fish
for
tea
in
earlier
days
he
would
have
said
how
accidental
you
are
what
would
have
happened
to
our
tea
if
you
hadn
t
been
down
here
or
if
you
hadn
t
by
chance
thought
of
fish
he
would
have
tried
to
show
her
that
her
activities
were
not
based
in
the
principles
of
reason
and
that
even
the
composition
of
meals
ought
not
to
depend
upon
the
hazard
of
an
impulse
now
wiser
he
said
not
a
word
he
resigned
himself
in
silence
to
an
extra
of
a
mile
of
walking
in
such
matters
where
her
deep
instinctiveness
came
into
play
she
had
established
over
him
a
definite
ascendancy
then
another
grievance
was
that
she
had
sent
george
to
hanbridge
knowing
that
george
according
to
a
solemn
family
engagement
ought
to
have
been
at
the
works
she
was
conscienceless
a
third
grievance
naturally
was
her
behaviour
to
ingpen
and
a
fourth
came
back
again
to
george
why
had
she
sent
george
to
hanbridge
at
all
was
it
not
to
despatch
a
telegram
which
she
was
afraid
to
submit
to
the
inquisitiveness
of
the
post
office
at
bursley
a
daring
supposition
but
plausible
and
if
correct
of
what
duplicity
was
she
not
guilty
the
mad
shameful
episode
of
johnnie
orgreave
the
awful
dilemma
of
janet
colossal
affairs
though
they
were
interested
him
less
and
less
as
he
grew
more
and
more
preoccupied
with
his
relations
to
hilda
and
he
thought
not
caring
something
terrific
will
occur
between
us
one
of
these
days
and
then
his
bravado
would
turn
to
panic
ii
they
passed
along
wedgwood
street
and
hilda
preceded
him
into
the
chief
s
here
was
another
slight
grievance
of
edwin
s
for
the
chief
s
happened
now
to
be
the
clayhanger
shop
at
the
corner
of
wedgwood
street
and
duck
bank
positively
there
had
been
competitors
for
the
old
location
why
should
hilda
go
there
and
drag
him
there
could
she
not
comprehend
that
he
had
a
certain
fine
delicacy
about
entering
the
place
where
the
former
sign
had
been
was
plainly
visible
on
the
brickwork
above
the
rabbits
fowl
and
a
few
brace
of
grouse
hung
in
the
window
from
which
most
of
the
glass
had
been
removed
and
in
the
left
upon
slabs
of
sicilian
marble
lay
amid
ice
the
curved
forms
of
many
fish
and
behind
them
was
the
fat
figure
of
the
chief
s
wife
with
her
great
wet
hands
he
was
sad
he
seriously
thought
yet
again
things
are
not
what
they
were
in
this
town
somehow
for
this
place
had
once
been
a
printer
s
and
he
had
a
conviction
that
printing
was
an
aristocrat
among
trades
indeed
could
printing
and
fishmongering
be
compared
the
saleswoman
greeted
them
with
deference
calling
edwin
sir
and
yet
with
a
certain
complacent
familiarity
as
an
occupant
to
edwin
casually
gave
the
short
shake
of
the
head
which
in
the
district
may
signify
and
turned
humming
to
look
at
the
hanging
game
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
only
keep
his
dignity
as
a
man
of
the
world
by
looking
at
the
grouse
with
a
connoisseur
s
eye
why
didn
t
hilda
buy
grouse
the
shop
was
a
poor
little
interior
it
smelt
ill
he
wondered
what
the
upper
rooms
were
like
and
what
had
happened
to
the
decrepit
building
at
the
end
of
the
yard
the
saleswoman
slapped
the
fish
about
on
the
marble
and
running
water
could
be
heard
edwin
said
hilda
with
enchanting
sweetness
and
simplicity
would
you
like
hake
or
turbot
dear
impossible
to
divine
from
her
voice
that
the
ruin
of
their
two
favourite
orgreaves
was
complete
that
she
was
conducting
a
secret
correspondence
and
that
she
had
knowingly
and
deliberately
offended
her
husband
both
women
waited
moveless
for
the
decision
as
for
an
august
decree
when
the
transaction
was
finished
the
saleswoman
handed
over
the
parcel
into
hilda
s
gloved
hands
it
was
a
parcel
not
at
all
like
the
neat
stiff
of
the
modern
age
very
hot
isn
t
it
ma
am
said
the
saleswoman
and
hilda
utterly
distinguished
in
gesture
and
tone
replied
with
calm
impartial
urbanity
very
good
afternoon
i
d
better
take
that
thing
said
edwin
outside
in
spite
of
himself
she
gave
up
the
parcel
to
him
tell
cook
to
fry
it
said
hilda
she
always
fries
better
than
she
boils
he
repeated
tell
cook
to
fry
what
s
up
now
his
tone
challenged
i
must
go
over
and
see
janet
at
once
i
shall
take
the
next
car
he
lifted
the
end
of
his
nose
in
disgust
there
was
no
end
to
the
girl
s
caprices
why
at
once
the
superior
male
demanded
disdain
and
resentment
were
in
his
voice
hundreds
of
times
when
alone
he
had
decided
that
he
would
never
use
that
voice
first
because
it
was
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
second
because
it
never
achieved
any
good
result
and
third
because
it
often
did
harm
yet
he
would
use
it
the
voice
had
an
existence
and
a
volition
of
its
own
within
his
being
he
marvelled
that
the
essential
mechanism
of
life
should
be
so
clumsy
and
inefficient
he
heard
the
voice
come
out
and
yet
was
not
displeased
was
indeed
rather
pleasantly
excited
a
new
grievance
had
been
created
for
him
he
might
have
ignored
it
just
as
he
might
ignore
a
solitary
cigarette
lying
in
his
cigarette
case
both
cigarettes
and
grievances
were
bad
for
him
but
he
could
not
ignore
them
the
last
cigarette
in
the
case
magnetised
him
useless
to
argue
with
himself
that
he
had
already
smoked
more
than
enough
the
cigarette
had
to
emerge
from
the
case
and
be
burnt
and
the
grievance
too
was
irresistible
in
an
instant
he
had
it
between
his
teeth
and
was
darkly
enjoying
it
of
course
hilda
s
passionate
pity
for
janet
was
a
fine
thing
granted
but
therein
was
no
reason
why
she
should
let
it
run
away
with
her
the
worst
of
these
capricious
impulsive
creatures
was
that
they
could
never
do
anything
fine
without
an
enormous
fuss
and
upset
what
possible
difference
would
it
make
whether
hilda
went
to
break
the
news
of
disaster
to
janet
at
once
or
in
an
hour
s
time
the
mere
desire
to
protect
and
assuage
could
not
properly
furnish
an
excuse
for
unnecessarily
dislocating
a
household
and
depriving
oneself
of
food
on
the
contrary
it
was
wiser
and
more
truly
kind
to
take
one
s
meals
regularly
in
a
crisis
but
hilda
would
never
appreciate
that
profound
truth
never
never
moreover
it
was
certain
that
johnnie
had
written
to
janet
i
feel
i
must
go
at
once
said
hilda
he
spoke
with
more
marked
scorn
and
what
about
your
tea
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
about
my
tea
of
course
it
matters
about
your
tea
if
you
have
your
tea
quietly
you
ll
find
the
end
of
the
world
won
t
have
come
and
you
can
go
and
see
janet
just
the
same
and
the
whole
house
won
t
have
been
turned
upside
down
she
put
her
lips
together
and
smiled
mysteriously
saying
nothing
the
racket
of
the
hanbridge
and
knype
could
be
heard
behind
them
she
did
not
turn
her
head
the
car
overtook
them
and
then
stopped
a
few
yards
in
front
but
she
did
not
hail
the
conductor
the
car
went
onwards
he
had
won
his
argument
had
been
so
convincing
that
she
could
not
help
being
convinced
it
was
too
powerful
for
even
her
obstinacy
which
as
a
rule
successfully
defied
any
argument
whatever
did
he
smile
and
forgive
did
he
extend
to
her
the
blessing
of
his
benevolence
no
he
could
not
have
brought
himself
to
such
a
point
after
all
she
had
done
nothing
to
earn
approval
she
had
simply
refrained
from
foolishness
she
had
had
to
be
reminded
of
considerations
which
ought
ever
to
have
been
present
in
her
brain
doubtless
she
thought
that
he
was
hard
that
he
was
incapable
of
her
divine
pity
for
janet
but
that
was
only
because
she
could
not
imagine
a
combination
of
emotional
generosity
and
calm
commonsense
and
she
never
would
be
able
to
imagine
it
hence
she
would
always
be
unjust
to
him
when
they
arrived
home
she
was
still
smiling
mysteriously
to
herself
she
did
not
take
her
hat
off
sign
of
disturbance
he
moved
with
careful
tranquillity
through
the
ritual
that
preceded
tea
he
could
feel
her
in
the
house
ordering
it
softening
it
civilising
it
he
could
smell
the
fish
he
could
detect
the
subservience
of
ada
to
her
mistress
s
serious
mood
he
went
into
the
ada
followed
him
with
a
tray
of
hot
things
hilda
followed
ada
then
george
entered
cleaner
than
ordinary
edwin
savoured
deeply
the
functioning
of
his
home
and
his
wife
had
yielded
her
instinct
had
compelled
her
not
to
neglect
him
his
sagacity
had
mastered
her
in
her
heart
she
must
admire
his
sagacity
whatever
she
said
or
looked
and
her
unreasoning
passion
for
him
was
still
the
paramount
force
in
her
vitality
now
are
you
two
all
right
said
hilda
when
she
had
poured
out
the
tea
and
edwin
was
carving
the
fish
edwin
glanced
up
i
don
t
want
any
tea
she
said
i
couldn
t
touch
it
she
bent
and
kissed
george
took
her
gloves
from
the
sideboard
and
left
the
house
the
mysterious
smile
still
on
her
face
iii
edwin
controlled
his
vexation
at
this
dramatic
move
it
was
only
slight
and
he
had
to
play
the
serene
omniscient
to
george
further
the
attractive
food
helped
to
make
him
bland
didn
t
you
know
your
mother
had
to
go
out
said
edwin
with
astounding
guile
yes
she
told
me
upstairs
george
murmured
while
she
was
washing
me
she
said
she
had
to
go
and
see
auntie
janet
again
the
reply
was
a
blow
to
edwin
she
had
said
nothing
to
him
but
she
had
told
the
boy
still
his
complacency
was
not
overset
boy
and
stepfather
began
to
talk
with
the
mingled
freedom
and
constraint
practised
by
males
accustomed
to
the
presence
of
a
woman
when
the
woman
is
absent
each
was
aware
of
the
stress
of
a
novel
mysterious
and
grave
situation
each
also
thought
of
the
woman
and
each
knew
that
the
other
was
thinking
of
the
woman
each
over
a
serious
apprehension
seemed
to
be
lightly
saying
it
s
rather
fun
to
be
without
her
for
a
bit
but
we
must
be
able
to
rely
on
her
return
nothing
stood
between
them
and
domestic
discomfort
possible
stupidity
in
the
kitchen
had
no
check
as
regards
the
mere
household
machine
they
had
a
ridiculous
and
amusing
sense
of
distant
danger
edwin
had
to
get
up
in
order
to
pour
out
more
tea
he
reckoned
that
he
could
both
make
tea
and
pour
it
out
with
more
exactitude
than
his
wife
who
often
forgot
to
put
the
milk
in
first
but
he
could
not
pour
it
out
with
the
same
grace
his
brain
not
his
heart
poured
the
tea
out
he
left
the
tray
in
disorder
the
symmetry
of
the
table
was
soon
wrecked
glad
you
re
going
back
to
school
i
suppose
said
edwin
satirically
george
nodded
he
was
drinking
and
he
glanced
at
edwin
over
the
rim
of
the
cup
he
had
grown
much
in
twelve
months
and
was
more
than
twelve
months
older
edwin
was
puzzled
by
the
almost
sudden
developments
of
his
intelligence
sometimes
the
boy
was
just
like
a
young
man
his
voice
had
become
a
little
uncertain
he
still
showed
the
greatest
contempt
for
his
fingernails
but
he
had
truly
discovered
the
toothbrush
and
was
preaching
it
at
school
among
a
population
that
scoffed
yet
was
impressed
yes
i
m
glad
he
answered
oh
you
re
glad
are
you
well
i
m
glad
in
a
way
a
boy
does
have
to
go
to
school
doesn
t
he
uncle
and
the
sooner
it
s
over
the
better
i
tell
you
what
i
should
like
i
should
like
to
go
to
school
night
and
day
and
have
no
holidays
till
it
was
all
done
i
sh
d
think
you
could
save
at
least
three
years
with
that
a
bit
hard
on
the
masters
wouldn
t
it
be
i
never
thought
of
that
of
course
it
would
never
be
over
for
them
i
expect
they
d
gradually
die
then
you
don
t
like
school
george
shook
his
head
did
you
like
school
uncle
edwin
shook
his
head
they
both
laughed
uncle
can
i
leave
school
when
i
m
sixteen
i
ve
told
you
once
yes
i
know
but
did
you
mean
it
people
change
so
i
told
you
you
could
leave
school
when
you
re
sixteen
if
you
pass
the
london
matric
but
what
good
s
the
london
matric
to
an
architect
orgreave
says
it
isn
t
any
good
anyway
when
did
he
tell
you
that
yesterday
but
not
so
long
since
you
were
all
for
being
a
ah
i
was
only
pretending
to
myself
george
smiled
well
fetch
me
my
cigarettes
off
the
mantelpiece
in
the
the
boy
ran
off
eager
to
serve
and
edwin
s
glance
followed
him
with
affection
george
s
desire
to
be
an
architect
had
consistently
strengthened
save
during
a
brief
period
when
the
show
of
the
north
staffordshire
agricultural
society
held
with
much
splendour
at
hanbridge
had
put
another
idea
into
his
noddle
an
idea
that
fed
itself
richly
on
glorious
bulls
and
other
prize
cattle
for
about
a
week
and
then
expired
indeed
already
it
had
been
in
a
kind
of
way
arranged
that
the
youth
should
ultimately
be
articled
to
johnnie
orgreave
among
many
consequences
of
johnnie
s
defiance
to
society
would
probably
be
the
quashing
of
that
arrangement
and
there
was
johnnie
on
the
eve
of
his
elopement
chatting
to
george
about
the
futility
of
the
london
matriculation
edwin
wondered
how
george
would
gradually
learn
what
had
happened
to
his
friend
and
inspirer
john
orgreave
he
arrived
with
the
cigarettes
and
offered
them
and
lit
the
match
and
offered
that
and
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
afternoon
edwin
enquired
between
puffs
of
smoke
oh
nothing
much
i
thought
you
were
coming
to
the
works
and
then
going
down
to
auntie
clara
s
for
tea
so
i
was
but
mother
sent
me
to
hanbridge
oh
murmured
edwin
casually
so
your
mother
packed
you
off
to
hanbridge
did
she
i
had
to
go
to
the
post
office
george
continued
i
think
it
was
a
telegram
but
it
was
in
an
envelope
and
some
money
said
edwin
with
a
very
indifferent
air
he
was
however
so
affected
that
he
jumped
up
abruptly
from
the
table
and
went
into
the
darkening
chill
garden
ignoring
george
george
accustomed
to
these
sudden
accessions
of
interest
and
these
sudden
forgettings
went
unperturbed
his
ways
about
half
past
eight
hilda
returned
edwin
was
closing
the
curtains
in
the
the
gas
had
been
lighted
johnnie
has
evidently
written
to
alicia
she
burst
out
somewhat
breathless
because
alicia
s
telegraphed
to
janet
that
she
must
positively
go
straight
down
there
and
stay
with
them
when
she
leaves
the
home
what
on
dartmoor
edwin
muttered
in
a
strange
voice
the
very
word
dartmoor
made
him
shake
it
isn
t
actually
on
the
moor
said
hilda
and
so
i
shall
take
her
down
myself
i
ve
told
her
all
about
things
she
wasn
t
a
bit
surprised
they
re
a
strange
lot
she
tried
to
speak
quite
naturally
but
he
knew
that
she
was
not
succeeding
their
eyes
would
not
meet
edwin
thought
how
far
away
we
are
from
this
morning
hazard
and
fate
like
converging
armies
seemed
to
be
closing
upon
him
chapter
xiii
the
departure
i
it
was
a
wet
morning
hilda
already
in
full
street
attire
save
for
her
gloves
and
with
a
half
empty
cup
of
tea
by
her
side
sat
at
the
desk
in
the
boudoir
she
unlocked
the
large
central
drawer
immediately
below
the
flap
of
the
desk
with
a
peculiar
quick
ruthless
gesture
which
gesture
produced
a
very
short
snappy
click
that
summed
up
all
the
tension
spreading
from
hilda
s
mind
throughout
the
house
and
even
into
the
town
it
had
been
decided
that
in
order
to
call
for
janet
at
the
nursing
home
and
catch
the
crewe
train
at
knype
for
the
bristol
and
southwest
of
england
connexion
hilda
must
leave
the
house
at
five
minutes
to
nine
this
great
fact
was
paramount
in
the
minds
of
various
people
besides
hilda
ada
upstairs
stood
bent
and
flushed
over
a
huge
portmanteau
into
which
she
was
putting
the
last
things
while
george
hindered
her
by
simultaneously
tying
to
the
leather
handle
a
wet
label
finely
directed
by
himself
in
architectural
characters
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
was
preparing
the
master
s
nine
o
clock
breakfast
with
new
solicitudes
caused
by
a
serious
sense
of
responsibility
for
hilda
having
informed
her
in
moving
tones
that
the
master
s
welfare
in
the
mistress
s
absence
would
depend
finally
on
herself
had
solemnly
entrusted
that
welfare
to
her
had
almost
passed
it
to
her
from
hand
to
hand
with
precautions
like
a
jewel
in
a
casket
ada
it
may
be
said
had
immediately
felt
the
weight
of
the
cook
s
increased
importance
edwin
and
the
clerks
at
the
works
knew
that
edwin
had
to
be
home
for
breakfast
at
a
quarter
to
nine
instead
of
nine
and
that
he
must
not
be
late
as
clayhanger
had
a
train
to
catch
and
accordingly
the
morning
s
routine
of
the
office
was
modified
and
finally
a
short
old
man
in
a
rainy
in
acre
parade
between
acre
lane
and
oldcastle
street
struggling
to
force
a
collar
over
the
head
of
a
that
towered
above
his
own
head
was
already
blasphemously
excited
by
those
pessimistic
apprehensions
about
the
flight
of
time
which
forty
years
of
had
never
sufficed
to
allay
in
him
as
for
janet
she
alone
in
her
weakness
and
her
submissiveness
was
calm
the
nurse
and
hilda
understood
one
another
and
she
was
leaving
it
all
to
them
hilda
opened
the
drawer
half
lifting
the
flap
of
the
desk
to
disclose
its
contents
it
was
full
of
odd
papers
letters
bills
envelopes
and
a
small
book
or
two
a
prejudiced
observer
such
as
edwin
might
have
said
that
the
drawer
was
extremely
untidy
but
to
hilda
who
had
herself
put
in
each
item
separately
and
each
for
a
separate
reason
the
drawer
was
not
untidy
for
her
intelligence
knew
the
plan
of
it
and
every
item
as
it
caught
her
eye
suggested
a
justifying
reason
and
a
good
one
nevertheless
she
formed
an
intention
to
tidy
out
the
drawer
the
only
drawer
in
the
desk
with
a
safe
lock
upon
her
return
home
she
felt
at
the
back
of
the
drawer
drew
forth
the
drawer
a
little
further
and
felt
again
vainly
a
doubt
of
her
own
essential
orderliness
crossed
her
mind
surely
i
can
t
have
put
those
letters
anywhere
else
surely
i
ve
not
mislaid
them
then
she
closed
the
flap
of
the
desk
and
pulled
the
drawer
right
out
letting
it
rest
on
her
knees
yes
the
packet
was
there
hidden
and
so
was
another
packet
of
letters
in
the
handwriting
of
edwin
she
was
reassured
she
knew
she
was
tidy
had
always
been
tidy
and
edwin
s
innuendos
to
the
contrary
were
inexcusable
jerking
the
drawer
irregularly
back
by
force
into
its
place
she
locked
it
reopened
the
desk
laid
the
packet
on
the
and
took
a
telegram
from
her
purse
to
add
to
the
letters
in
the
packet
the
letters
were
all
in
the
same
loose
sloping
hand
and
on
the
same
tinted
notepaper
the
signature
was
plain
on
one
of
them
charlotte
cannon
and
then
after
it
in
brackets
canonges
the
latter
being
the
real
name
of
george
cannon
s
french
father
and
george
cannon
s
only
legal
name
the
topmost
letter
began
dear
madam
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
my
husband
still
declares
his
innocence
of
the
crime
for
which
he
is
now
in
prison
he
requests
that
you
shall
be
informed
of
this
i
ought
perhaps
to
tell
you
that
since
the
change
in
my
religious
convictions
my
feelings
the
first
page
ended
there
hilda
turned
the
letters
over
preoccupied
gazing
at
them
and
deciphering
chance
phrases
here
and
there
the
first
letter
was
dated
about
a
year
earlier
it
constituted
the
beginning
of
the
resuscitation
of
just
that
part
of
her
life
which
she
had
thought
to
be
definitely
interred
in
memory
hilda
had
only
once
and
on
a
legal
occasion
met
canonges
as
with
strict
correctness
she
called
herself
in
brackets
a
surprisingly
old
lady
with
quite
white
hair
and
she
had
thought
what
a
shame
for
that
erotic
old
woman
to
have
bought
and
married
a
man
so
much
younger
than
herself
no
wonder
he
ran
away
from
her
she
had
been
positively
shocked
by
the
spectacle
of
the
prim
decrepit
creature
with
her
aristocratic
voice
and
her
knowledge
of
the
possibilities
of
human
nature
was
thenceforth
enlarged
and
when
george
cannon
known
to
the
law
only
as
canonges
had
received
two
years
hard
labour
for
going
through
a
ceremony
of
marriage
with
herself
she
had
esteemed
despite
all
her
resentment
against
him
that
his
chief
sin
lay
in
his
real
first
marriage
not
in
his
false
second
one
and
that
for
that
sin
the
old
woman
was
the
more
deserving
of
punishment
and
when
the
old
woman
had
with
strange
naïvete
written
to
say
that
she
had
become
a
convert
to
roman
catholicism
and
that
her
marriage
and
her
imprisoned
bigamous
husband
were
henceforth
to
her
sacred
hilda
had
reflected
sardonically
of
course
it
is
always
that
sort
of
woman
that
turns
to
religion
when
she
s
too
old
for
anything
else
and
when
the
news
came
that
her
deceiver
had
got
ten
years
penal
servitude
and
might
have
got
penal
servitude
for
life
for
uttering
a
forged
note
hilda
had
reflected
in
the
same
strain
of
course
a
man
who
would
behave
as
george
behaved
to
me
would
be
just
the
man
to
go
about
forging
bank
notes
i
am
not
in
the
least
astonished
what
an
inconceivable
simpleton
i
was
a
very
long
time
had
elapsed
before
the
letter
arrived
bearing
the
rumour
of
cannon
s
innocence
it
had
not
immediately
produced
much
effect
on
her
mind
she
had
said
not
a
word
to
edwin
the
idea
of
reviving
the
shames
of
that
early
episode
in
conversation
with
edwin
was
extremely
repugnant
to
her
she
would
not
do
it
she
had
not
the
right
to
do
it
all
her
proud
independence
forbade
her
to
do
it
the
episode
did
not
concern
edwin
the
effect
on
her
of
the
rumour
came
gradually
it
was
increased
when
cannon
wrote
of
evidence
a
petition
to
the
home
secretary
and
employing
a
lawyer
cannon
s
attitude
seemed
to
say
to
hilda
you
and
i
have
shared
this
man
we
alone
in
all
the
world
cannon
seemed
to
imagine
that
hilda
would
be
interested
she
was
right
hilda
was
interested
her
implacability
relented
her
vindictiveness
forgave
she
pondered
with
almost
intolerable
compassion
upon
the
vision
of
george
cannon
suffering
unjustly
month
after
long
month
interminably
the
horrors
of
a
convict
s
existence
she
read
with
morbidity
reports
of
assizes
and
picked
up
from
papers
and
books
and
from
cannon
pieces
of
information
about
prisons
when
he
was
transferred
to
parkhurst
in
the
isle
of
wight
on
account
of
she
was
glad
because
she
knew
that
parkhurst
was
less
awful
than
portland
and
when
from
parkhurst
he
was
sent
to
dartmoor
she
tried
to
hope
that
the
bracing
air
would
do
him
good
she
no
longer
thought
of
him
as
a
criminal
at
all
but
simply
as
one
victim
of
his
passion
for
herself
she
hilda
had
been
the
other
victim
she
raged
in
secret
against
the
british
judicature
its
delays
its
stoniness
its
stupidity
and
when
the
principal
witness
in
support
of
cannon
s
petition
died
she
raged
against
fate
the
movement
for
cannon
s
release
slackened
for
months
of
late
it
had
been
resumed
and
with
hopefulness
one
of
cannon
s
companions
had
emerged
from
confinement
due
to
an
unconnected
crime
and
was
ready
to
swear
affidavits
lastly
cannon
had
written
stating
that
she
was
almost
beggared
and
suggesting
that
hilda
should
lend
her
ten
pounds
towards
the
expenses
of
the
affair
hilda
had
not
ten
pounds
that
very
day
hilda
seeing
janet
in
the
nursing
home
had
demanded
i
say
jan
i
suppose
you
haven
t
got
ten
pounds
you
can
let
me
have
for
about
a
day
or
so
and
had
laughed
janet
flushing
with
eager
pleasure
had
replied
of
course
i
ve
still
got
that
note
the
poor
old
dad
gave
me
i
ve
always
kept
it
in
case
the
worst
should
happen
janet
was
far
too
affectionate
to
display
curiosity
hilda
had
posted
the
late
at
night
the
next
day
had
come
a
telegram
from
cannon
telegraph
if
you
are
sending
money
not
for
a
great
deal
would
hilda
have
despatched
through
the
hands
of
the
old
postmaster
at
bursley
who
had
once
been
postmaster
at
turnhill
and
known
her
parents
a
telegram
such
as
hers
addressed
to
anybody
named
cannon
the
fear
of
chatter
and
scandal
was
irrational
but
it
was
a
very
genuine
fear
she
had
sent
her
faithful
george
with
the
telegram
to
hanbridge
it
was
just
as
easy
hilda
now
after
hesitation
put
the
packet
of
letters
in
her
handbag
to
take
with
her
it
was
a
precaution
of
secrecy
which
she
admitted
to
be
unnecessary
for
she
was
quite
certain
that
edwin
never
looked
into
her
drawers
much
less
would
he
try
to
open
a
locked
drawer
his
incurious
confidence
in
her
was
in
some
respects
almost
touching
certainly
nobody
else
would
invade
the
drawer
still
she
hid
the
letters
in
her
handbag
then
in
her
fashion
she
scribbled
a
note
to
cannon
giving
a
temporary
address
and
this
also
she
put
in
the
handbag
her
attitude
to
cannon
like
her
attitude
to
the
bigamist
had
slowly
changed
and
she
thought
of
the
old
woman
now
with
respect
and
sympathetic
sorrow
cannon
before
she
knew
that
hilda
was
married
to
edwin
had
addressed
her
first
letter
to
hilda
cannon
when
she
would
have
been
justified
in
addressing
it
miss
lessways
in
the
days
of
her
it
had
been
impossible
owing
to
business
reasons
for
hilda
to
drop
the
name
to
which
she
was
not
entitled
and
to
revert
to
her
own
the
authentic
cannon
despite
the
violence
of
her
grievances
had
respected
hilda
s
difficulty
the
act
showed
kindly
forbearance
and
it
had
aroused
hilda
s
imaginative
gratitude
further
cannon
s
pertinacity
in
the
liberation
proceedings
and
her
calm
logical
acceptance
of
all
the
frightful
consequences
of
being
the
legal
wife
of
a
convict
had
little
by
little
impressed
hilda
who
had
said
to
herself
there
is
something
in
this
old
woman
and
hilda
nowadays
never
thought
of
her
as
an
old
woman
who
had
been
perverse
and
shameless
in
desire
but
as
a
victim
of
passion
like
george
cannon
she
said
to
herself
this
old
woman
still
loves
george
cannon
her
love
was
the
secret
of
her
rancour
against
him
and
it
is
also
the
secret
of
her
compassion
these
constant
reflections
by
their
magnanimity
and
their
insistence
upon
the
tremendous
reality
of
love
did
something
to
ennoble
the
clandestine
and
demoralising
life
of
the
soul
which
for
a
year
hilda
had
hidden
from
her
husband
and
from
everybody
ii
it
still
wanted
twenty
minutes
to
nine
o
clock
she
was
too
soon
the
night
before
edwin
had
abraded
her
sore
nerves
by
warning
her
not
to
be
late
in
a
tone
that
implied
habitual
lateness
on
her
part
hilda
was
convinced
that
she
was
an
exact
woman
she
might
be
late
a
little
late
six
times
together
but
as
there
was
a
sound
explanation
of
and
excuse
for
each
shortcoming
her
essential
exactitude
remained
always
unimpaired
in
her
own
mind
but
edwin
would
not
see
this
he
told
her
now
and
then
that
she
belonged
to
that
large
class
of
people
who
have
the
illusion
that
a
clock
stands
still
at
the
last
moment
while
last
things
are
being
done
she
resented
the
observation
as
she
resented
many
of
edwin
s
assumptions
concerning
her
edwin
seemed
to
forget
that
she
had
been
one
of
the
first
in
england
that
she
had
been
a
and
accustomed
to
correct
the
negligences
of
men
of
business
and
finally
that
she
had
been
in
business
by
herself
for
a
number
of
years
edwin
would
sweep
all
that
away
and
treat
her
like
one
of
your
mere
brainless
butterflies
at
any
rate
on
the
present
occasion
she
was
not
late
and
she
took
pride
instead
of
shame
in
her
exaggerated
earliness
she
had
the
air
of
having
performed
a
remarkable
feat
she
left
the
boudoir
to
go
upstairs
and
superintend
ada
though
she
had
told
the
impressed
ada
that
she
should
put
full
trust
in
her
and
should
not
superintend
her
however
as
she
opened
the
door
she
heard
the
sounds
of
ada
and
george
directing
each
other
in
the
joint
enterprise
of
bringing
a
very
large
and
unwieldy
portmanteau
out
of
the
bedroom
the
hour
for
superintendence
was
therefore
past
hilda
went
into
the
idly
nervously
to
wait
till
the
portmanteau
should
have
reached
the
hall
the
french
window
was
ajar
and
a
wet
wind
entered
from
the
garden
the
garden
was
full
of
rain
two
workmen
were
in
it
employed
by
the
new
inhabitants
of
the
home
of
the
orgreaves
those
upstarts
had
decided
that
certain
branches
of
the
famous
orgreave
elms
were
dangerous
and
must
be
cut
and
the
workmen
shirt
sleeved
in
the
rain
were
staying
one
of
the
elms
with
a
rope
made
fast
to
the
swing
in
the
clayhanger
garden
hilda
was
unreasonably
but
sincerely
antipathetic
to
her
new
neighbours
the
stumps
of
great
made
her
feel
sick
useless
to
insist
to
her
on
the
notorious
treachery
of
elms
she
had
an
affection
for
those
elms
and
to
her
amputation
was
an
outrage
the
upstarts
had
committed
other
sacrilege
upon
the
house
and
grounds
not
heeding
that
the
abode
had
been
rendered
holy
by
the
sacraments
of
fate
hilda
stared
and
stared
at
the
rain
and
the
prospect
of
the
long
jolting
acutely
depressing
drive
through
the
mud
and
the
rain
to
knype
vale
and
of
the
interminable
train
journey
with
a
tragic
convalescent
braced
her
mother
george
stood
behind
her
well
have
you
got
the
luggage
down
she
frowned
but
george
knew
her
nervous
frown
and
could
rightly
interpret
it
he
nodded
ought
i
to
put
dartmoor
on
the
she
gave
a
negative
sign
why
should
he
ask
such
a
question
she
had
never
breathed
the
name
of
dartmoor
why
should
he
mention
it
edwin
also
had
mentioned
dartmoor
what
on
dartmoor
edwin
had
said
did
edwin
suspect
her
correspondence
no
had
he
suspected
he
would
have
spoken
she
knew
him
and
even
if
edwin
had
suspected
george
could
not
conceivably
have
had
suspicions
of
any
sort
there
he
stood
the
son
of
a
convict
with
no
name
of
his
own
he
existed
because
she
and
the
convict
had
been
unable
to
keep
apart
his
ignorance
of
the
past
was
appalling
to
think
of
the
dangers
incident
to
it
dreadful
his
easy
confidence
before
the
world
affected
her
almost
intolerably
she
felt
that
she
could
never
atone
to
him
for
having
borne
him
a
faint
noise
at
the
reached
the
here
s
nunks
exclaimed
george
and
ran
off
eagerly
this
was
his
new
name
for
his
stepfather
hilda
returned
quickly
to
the
boudoir
as
she
disappeared
therein
she
heard
george
descanting
to
edwin
on
the
beauties
of
his
and
edwin
rubbing
his
feet
on
the
mat
and
removing
his
mackintosh
she
came
back
to
the
door
of
the
boudoir
edwin
hello
one
moment
he
came
into
the
boudoir
wiping
the
rain
off
his
face
shut
the
door
will
you
her
earnest
tone
stirred
into
activity
the
dormant
secret
antagonisms
that
seemed
ever
to
lie
between
them
she
saw
them
animating
his
eyes
stiffening
his
pose
pointing
to
the
cup
and
saucer
on
the
desk
edwin
said
critically
that
all
you
ve
had
can
you
let
me
have
ten
pounds
she
asked
bluntly
ignoring
his
implication
that
in
the
matter
of
nourishment
she
had
not
behaved
sensibly
ten
pounds
more
he
was
on
the
defensive
as
it
were
crouching
warily
behind
a
screen
of
his
suspicions
she
nodded
awkwardly
she
wanted
to
be
graceful
persuasive
enveloping
but
she
could
not
it
was
to
repay
janet
that
she
had
need
of
the
money
she
ought
to
have
obtained
it
before
but
she
had
postponed
the
demand
and
she
had
been
wrong
janet
would
not
require
the
money
she
would
have
no
immediate
use
for
it
but
hilda
could
not
bear
to
be
in
debt
to
her
to
leave
the
sum
outstanding
would
seem
so
strange
so
sinister
so
equivocal
it
would
mar
all
their
intercourse
but
look
here
child
said
edwin
protesting
i
ve
given
you
about
forty
times
as
much
as
you
can
possibly
want
already
he
had
never
squarely
refused
any
demand
of
hers
for
money
he
had
almost
always
acceded
instantly
and
without
enquiry
to
her
demands
obviously
he
felt
sympathy
with
the
woman
who
by
eternal
custom
is
forced
to
ask
and
had
a
horror
of
behaving
as
the
majority
of
husbands
notoriously
behaved
in
such
circumstances
obviously
he
was
anxious
not
to
avail
himself
of
the
husband
s
overwhelming
economic
advantage
nevertheless
the
fact
that
he
earned
and
she
didn
t
was
ever
mysteriously
present
in
his
relatively
admirable
attitude
and
sometimes
perhaps
not
without
grounds
she
admitted
he
would
hesitate
before
a
request
and
in
him
a
hesitation
was
as
humiliating
as
a
refusal
would
have
been
from
another
man
and
hilda
resented
not
so
much
his
attitude
as
the
whole
social
convention
upon
which
it
was
unassailably
based
he
earned
she
knew
she
would
not
deny
that
he
was
the
unique
source
and
that
without
him
there
would
be
naught
but
still
she
did
not
think
that
she
ought
to
have
to
ask
on
the
other
hand
she
had
no
alternative
plan
to
offer
her
criticism
of
the
convention
was
destructive
not
constructive
and
all
edwin
s
careful
regard
for
a
woman
s
susceptibilities
seemed
only
to
intensify
her
revolt
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
he
was
thus
chivalrous
and
whether
he
was
chivalrous
or
not
she
was
in
his
power
and
she
chafed
i
should
be
glad
if
you
could
let
me
have
it
she
said
grimly
the
appeal
besides
being
unpersuasive
in
manner
was
too
general
it
did
not
particularize
there
was
no
frankness
between
them
she
saw
his
suspicions
multiplying
what
did
he
suspect
what
could
he
suspect
ah
and
why
was
she
herself
so
timorous
so
strangely
excited
about
going
even
to
the
edge
of
dartmoor
and
why
did
she
feel
guilty
why
was
her
glance
so
constrained
well
i
can
t
he
answered
not
now
but
if
anything
unexpected
turns
up
i
can
send
you
a
cheque
she
was
beaten
the
cab
stopped
at
the
well
in
advance
of
time
it
s
for
janet
she
muttered
to
him
desperately
edwin
s
face
changed
why
in
thunder
didn
t
you
say
so
to
start
with
he
exclaimed
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
of
course
i
ve
got
a
fiver
in
my
there
were
a
number
of
men
in
the
town
who
made
a
point
of
always
having
a
reserve
note
and
a
upon
their
persons
it
was
the
dandyism
of
prudence
he
sprang
out
of
the
room
the
door
swung
to
behind
him
in
a
very
few
moments
he
returned
here
you
are
he
said
taking
the
note
from
his
and
adding
it
to
a
collection
of
gold
and
silver
hilda
was
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
tail
of
the
cab
she
did
not
move
i
don
t
want
it
thanks
she
replied
coldly
and
she
thought
what
a
fool
i
am
oh
he
murmured
with
constraint
you
d
do
it
for
her
said
hilda
chill
and
clear
but
you
wouldn
t
do
it
for
me
and
she
thought
why
do
i
say
such
a
thing
he
slapped
all
the
money
crossly
down
on
the
desk
and
left
the
room
she
could
hear
him
instructing
ada
and
the
cabman
in
the
manipulation
of
the
great
portmanteau
now
mother
cried
george
she
gazed
at
the
money
and
picking
it
up
shovelled
it
into
her
purse
it
was
irresistible
in
the
hall
she
kissed
george
and
nodded
with
a
plaintive
smile
at
ada
edwin
was
in
the
porch
he
held
back
she
held
back
she
knew
from
his
face
that
he
would
not
offer
to
kiss
her
the
strange
power
that
had
compelled
her
to
alienate
him
refused
to
allow
her
to
relent
she
passed
down
the
steps
out
into
the
rain
they
nodded
the
theory
for
george
and
ada
being
that
they
had
made
their
farewells
in
the
boudoir
but
george
and
ada
none
the
less
had
their
notions
it
appeared
to
hilda
that
instead
of
going
for
a
holiday
with
her
closest
friend
she
was
going
to
some
recondite
disaster
that
involved
the
end
of
marriage
and
the
fact
that
she
and
edwin
had
not
kissed
outweighed
all
other
facts
in
the
universe
yet
what
was
a
kiss
until
the
cab
laboriously
started
she
hoped
for
a
miracle
it
did
not
happen
if
only
on
the
previous
night
she
had
not
absolutely
insisted
that
nobody
from
the
house
should
accompany
her
to
knype

baptising
tongue
hanging
out
two
swans
glittering
in
the
strong
light
swam
slowly
to
and
fro
one
had
a
black
claw
tucked
up
on
his
back
among
downy
white
feathers
the
other
hissed
at
the
dog
who
in
his
vast
and
shaggy
simply
could
not
understand
this
malevolence
on
the
part
of
a
round
about
the
elegant
haughtiness
of
the
swans
clustered
a
number
of
iridescent
muscovy
ducks
and
a
few
white
aylesburys
with
gamboge
beaks
that
intermittently
quacked
all
restless
and
expectant
of
blessings
to
fall
over
the
that
eternally
separated
them
from
the
heavenly
of
the
lawn
across
the
pond
looking
into
a
moored
dinghy
an
enormous
drake
with
a
vermilion
reposed
on
the
balustrade
of
the
the
water
reflected
everything
in
a
rippled
medley
blue
sky
rounded
woolly
clouds
birds
shrubs
flowers
grasses
and
depths
of
the
plantation
beyond
the
pond
where
tiny
children
in
white
were
tumbling
and
shrieking
with
a
nurse
in
white
harry
was
extraordinarily
hospitable
kind
and
agreeable
to
his
guest
scarcely
thirty
tall
and
slim
he
carried
himself
with
distinction
his
flannels
were
spotless
his
white
shirt
was
spotless
his
tennis
shoes
were
spotless
but
his
blazer
cap
and
necktie
which
all
had
the
same
multicoloured
pattern
of
stripes
were
shabby
soiled
and
without
shape
nevertheless
their
dilapidation
seemed
only
to
adorn
his
dandyism
for
they
possessed
a
mysterious
sacred
quality
he
had
a
beautiful
moustache
nice
eyes
hands
excitingly
dark
with
hair
and
no
affectations
whatever
although
he
had
inherited
tavy
mansion
and
a
fortune
from
an
aunt
who
had
left
oldcastle
and
the
smoke
to
marry
a
devonshire
landowner
he
was
boyish
modest
and
ingenuous
nobody
could
have
guessed
from
his
manner
that
he
had
children
nurses
servants
gardeners
grooms
horses
carriages
a
and
a
safe
margin
at
every
year
s
end
he
spoke
of
the
five
towns
with
a
mild
affection
hilda
thought
looking
at
him
he
has
everything
simply
everything
and
yet
he
s
quite
unspoilt
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
previous
years
he
had
seen
hilda
only
a
few
times
and
that
quite
casually
at
the
orgreaves
he
had
assumed
and
established
intimacy
at
the
very
moment
of
meeting
her
and
janet
at
tavistock
station
the
night
before
and
their
friendship
might
now
have
been
twenty
years
old
instead
of
twenty
hours
very
obviously
he
belonged
to
a
class
superior
to
hilda
s
but
he
was
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
what
was
still
the
most
and
influential
institution
of
english
life
his
confiding
confidential
tone
flattered
her
how
do
you
think
alicia
s
looking
he
asked
magnificent
said
hilda
throwing
a
last
piece
of
bread
into
the
water
so
do
i
said
he
but
she
s
ruined
for
tennis
you
know
this
baby
business
is
spiffing
only
it
puts
you
right
off
your
game
as
a
rule
she
manages
to
be
hors
de
combat
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
season
she
has
been
able
to
play
a
bit
this
year
but
she
s
not
keen
that
s
what
s
up
with
her
ladyship
she
s
not
keen
now
well
said
hilda
even
you
can
t
have
everything
why
even
me
he
laughed
she
merely
gazed
at
him
with
a
mysterious
smile
she
perceived
that
he
was
admiring
her
probably
for
her
enigmatic
quality
so
different
from
alicia
s
and
she
felt
a
pleasing
edwin
do
much
tennis
nowadays
edwin
she
repeated
the
name
in
astonishment
as
though
it
were
the
name
of
somebody
who
could
not
possibly
be
connected
with
tennis
not
he
he
s
not
touched
a
racket
all
this
season
he
s
quite
otherwise
employed
i
hear
he
s
a
fearful
pot
in
the
five
towns
anyway
said
harry
seriously
making
money
hand
over
fist
hilda
raised
her
eyebrows
and
shook
her
head
deprecatingly
but
the
marked
respectfulness
of
harry
s
reference
to
edwin
was
agreeable
she
thought
i
do
believe
i
m
becoming
a
snob
it
s
hard
work
making
money
even
in
our
small
way
in
bursley
she
said
and
seemed
to
indicate
the
expensive
spaciousness
of
the
gardens
i
should
like
to
see
old
edwin
again
i
never
knew
you
were
friends
well
i
used
to
see
him
pretty
often
at
lane
end
house
after
alicia
and
i
were
engaged
in
fact
once
he
jolly
nearly
beat
me
in
a
set
edwin
did
she
exclaimed
the
same
he
had
a
way
of
saying
things
that
a
feller
somehow
thought
about
afterwards
oh
so
you
noticed
that
does
he
still
i
i
don
t
know
but
he
used
to
you
ought
to
have
brought
him
in
fact
i
quite
thought
he
was
coming
anyhow
i
told
alicia
to
invite
him
too
as
soon
as
we
knew
you
were
bringing
old
jan
down
she
did
mention
it
alicia
did
but
oh
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
works
works
no
holiday
all
summer
i
ll
tell
you
a
scheme
said
harry
roguishly
refuse
to
rejoin
the
domestic
hearth
until
he
comes
and
fetches
you
she
gave
a
little
laugh
oh
he
won
t
come
to
fetch
me
well
said
harry
shortly
and
decisively
we
shall
see
what
can
be
done
i
may
tell
you
we
re
rather
great
at
getting
people
down
here
i
wonder
where
those
girls
are
he
turned
round
and
hilda
turned
round
the
red
georgian
house
with
its
windows
in
octagonal
panes
its
large
pediment
hiding
the
centre
of
the
roof
and
its
white
paint
showed
brilliantly
across
the
green
between
some
cypresses
and
an
ilex
on
either
side
were
smooth
walls
of
green
trimmed
shrubs
forming
long
alleys
whose
floors
were
also
green
and
here
and
there
a
round
or
oval
flowerbed
and
at
the
edges
of
the
garden
curved
borders
of
flowers
everything
was
still
save
the
birds
on
the
pond
the
distant
children
in
the
plantation
and
the
small
clouds
overhead
the
sun
s
warmth
was
like
an
endearment
janet
and
alicia
their
arms
round
each
other
s
shoulders
sauntered
into
view
from
behind
the
cypresses
on
the
more
sheltered
lawn
nearest
the
house
they
were
engaged
in
a
quiet
but
tremendous
palaver
nobody
but
themselves
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
it
might
have
been
the
affair
of
johnnie
and
chris
hamson
as
to
which
not
a
word
had
been
publicly
said
at
tavy
mansion
since
janet
and
hilda
s
arrival
janet
still
wore
black
and
now
she
carried
a
red
sunshade
belonging
to
alicia
alicia
was
in
white
not
very
clean
white
and
rather
tousled
she
was
only
she
had
grown
big
and
jolly
and
downright
even
to
a
certain
shamelessness
and
careless
of
herself
her
body
had
the
curves
and
her
face
the
emaciation
of
the
young
mother
she
used
abrupt
gawky
gestures
her
rough
affectionateness
embraced
not
merely
her
children
but
all
young
living
things
and
many
old
for
her
children
she
had
a
passion
and
she
would
say
openly
as
it
were
defiantly
that
she
meant
to
be
the
mother
of
more
children
lots
more
hey
lass
cried
out
harry
using
the
broad
staffordshire
accent
for
the
amusement
of
hilda
the
sisters
stopped
and
untwined
their
arms
hey
lad
alicia
loudly
responded
but
instead
of
looking
at
her
husband
she
was
looking
through
him
at
the
babies
in
the
plantation
behind
the
pond
janet
smiled
in
her
everlasting
resignation
hilda
smiling
at
her
in
return
from
the
distance
recalled
the
tone
in
which
harry
had
said
old
jan
a
tone
at
once
affectionate
and
she
was
old
jan
now
destined
to
be
a
burden
upon
somebody
and
of
very
little
use
to
anybody
no
longer
necessary
if
she
disappeared
life
would
immediately
close
over
her
and
not
a
relative
not
a
friend
would
be
inconvenienced
some
among
them
would
remark
perhaps
it
s
for
the
best
and
janet
knew
it
in
the
years
immediately
preceding
the
death
of
and
orgreave
she
had
hardened
a
little
from
her
earlier
soft
benevolent
self
hardened
to
everybody
save
her
father
and
mother
whom
she
protected
and
now
she
was
utterly
tender
again
and
her
gentle
acquiescences
seemed
to
say
i
am
defenceless
and
i
shall
be
old
i
m
going
to
telegraph
to
edwin
clayhanger
to
come
down
for
the
shouted
harry
and
alicia
shouted
in
reply
oh
spiffing
hilda
said
nervously
you
aren
t
really
she
had
no
intention
of
agreeing
to
the
pleasant
project
a
breach
definitely
existed
between
edwin
and
herself
and
the
idea
of
either
maintaining
it
or
ending
it
on
foreign
ground
was
inconceivable
such
things
could
only
be
done
at
home
she
had
telegraphed
a
safe
arrival
but
she
had
not
yet
written
to
him
nor
decided
in
what
tone
she
should
write
two
gardeners
one
pushing
a
wheeled
appeared
from
an
alley
and
began
silently
and
assiduously
to
water
a
shaded
alicia
and
harry
continued
to
shout
enthusiastically
to
each
other
in
a
manner
sufficiently
disturbing
but
the
gardeners
gave
no
sign
that
anybody
except
themselves
lived
in
the
garden
alicia
followed
by
janet
was
slowly
advancing
towards
the
croquet
lawn
when
a
parlourmaid
tripping
from
the
house
overtook
her
and
with
modest
deference
murmured
something
to
the
bawling
jolly
mistress
alicia
still
followed
by
janet
turned
and
went
into
the
house
while
the
parlourmaid
with
bent
head
waited
discreetly
to
bring
up
the
rear
a
sudden
and
terrific
envy
possessed
hilda
as
she
contrasted
the
circumstances
of
these
people
with
her
own
these
people
lived
in
lovely
and
cleanly
surroundings
without
a
care
beyond
the
apprehension
of
nursery
ailments
they
had
joyous
and
kindly
dispositions
they
were
and
they
were
attended
by
servants
who
professionally
were
even
better
bred
than
themselves
and
who
were
rendered
happy
by
smooth
words
and
good
pay
they
lived
at
peace
with
everyone
full
of
health
they
ate
well
and
slept
well
they
suffered
no
strain
they
had
absolutely
no
problems
and
they
did
not
seek
problems
nor
had
they
any
duties
save
agreeable
ones
to
each
other
their
world
was
ideal
if
you
had
asked
them
how
their
world
could
be
improved
for
them
they
would
not
have
found
an
easy
reply
they
could
only
have
demanded
less
taxes
and
more
fine
days
whereas
hilda
and
hers
were
forced
to
live
among
a
brutal
populace
amid
the
most
horrible
surroundings
of
smoke
dirt
and
squalor
in
devonshire
the
five
towns
was
unthinkable
the
whiteness
of
the
at
tavy
mansion
almost
broke
the
heart
of
the
housewife
in
hilda
and
compare
not
hilda
s
but
even
the
old
garden
of
the
orgreaves
with
this
elysium
where
nothing
offended
the
eye
and
the
soot
nowhere
lay
on
the
trees
blackening
the
shiny
leaves
and
stunting
the
branches
and
compare
the
too
mean
planning
and
of
the
house
in
trafalgar
road
with
the
lavish
generosity
of
space
inside
tavy
mansion
edwin
in
the
bursley
sense
was
a
successful
man
and
had
consequence
in
the
town
but
the
most
that
he
had
accomplished
or
could
accomplish
would
not
amount
to
the
beginning
of
appreciable
success
according
to
higher
standards
nobody
in
bursley
really
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
success
and
even
such
local
success
as
edwin
had
had
at
what
peril
and
with
what
worry
was
it
won
these
heskeths
were
safe
forever
ah
she
envied
them
and
she
intensely
depreciated
everything
that
was
hers
she
stood
in
the
tavy
mansion
garden
it
seemed
to
her
like
an
impostor
her
husband
was
merely
struggling
upwards
and
moreover
she
had
quarrelled
with
him
darkly
and
obscurely
and
who
could
guess
what
would
be
the
end
of
marriage
harry
and
alicia
never
quarrelled
they
might
have
tiffs
nothing
worse
than
that
they
had
no
grounds
for
quarrelling
and
supposing
harry
and
alicia
guessed
the
link
connecting
her
with
dartmoor
prison
no
it
could
not
be
supposed
her
envy
melted
into
secret
deep
dejection
amid
the
beautiful
and
prosperous
scene
evidently
some
one
s
called
said
harry
of
his
wife
s
disappearance
i
hope
she
s
nice
who
whoever
s
called
shall
we
knock
the
balls
about
a
bit
they
began
a
mild
game
of
croquet
but
after
a
few
minutes
hilda
burst
out
sharply
you
aren
t
playing
your
best
hesketh
i
wish
you
would
he
was
startled
by
her
eyes
and
her
tone
honest
injun
i
am
he
fibbed
in
answer
but
i
ll
try
to
do
better
you
must
remember
croquet
isn
t
my
game
alicia
floors
me
at
it
five
times
out
of
six
then
the
parlourmaid
and
another
maid
came
out
to
lay
tea
on
two
tables
under
the
ilex
bowley
said
harry
over
his
shoulder
bring
me
a
next
time
you
come
out
will
you
yes
sir
said
the
parlourmaid
hilda
protested
no
hesketh
really
i
assure
you
the
came
with
the
tea
harry
knocked
a
ball
against
a
coloured
stick
and
both
he
and
hilda
sat
down
with
relief
who
s
called
bowley
rotherwas
sir
harry
counted
the
cups
isn
t
she
staying
for
tea
no
sir
i
think
not
sir
hilda
humming
rose
and
walked
about
at
the
same
moment
alicia
janet
and
a
tall
young
woman
in
black
and
yellow
emerged
from
the
house
hilda
moved
behind
a
tree
she
could
hear
the
group
vanished
round
the
side
of
the
house
and
then
came
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
of
wheels
crunching
an
instant
later
alicia
arrived
at
the
ilex
bounding
and
jolly
janet
moved
more
sedately
the
bernard
who
had
been
reposing
near
the
pond
now
smelt
the
tea
and
hot
cakes
and
joined
the
party
the
wagging
of
his
powerful
tail
knocked
over
a
and
alicia
gave
a
squeal
then
alicia
putting
her
hands
to
her
mouth
shouted
across
the
lawn
and
the
pond
nursey
nursey
take
them
in
and
a
faint
reply
came
what
was
the
rotherwas
dame
after
asked
harry
sharpening
a
pencil
when
alicia
had
ascertained
the
desires
of
her
guests
as
to
milk
and
sugar
she
was
after
you
of
course
said
alicia
tennis

shall
all

hilda
she

be
delighted
i

only
she

in
such
a
hurry
hilda
enquired
who
is
mrs
rotherwas
her
husband
s
a
big
at
cardiff
but
she
s
a
niece
or
something
of
the
governor
of
dartmoor
prison
and
she
s
apparently
helping
to
keep
house
for
dear
uncle
just
now
they
ll
take
us
over
the
prison
before
tennis
it
s
awfully
interesting
harry
and
i
have
been
once
oh
murmured
hilda
staggered
now
about
this
ere
woire
said
harry
what
price
this
he
handed
over
the
message
which
he
had
just
composed
it
was
rather
long
and
on
the
form
was
left
space
for
only
two
more
words
hilda
could
not
decipher
it
she
saw
the
characters
with
her
eyes
but
she
was
incapable
of
interpreting
them
all
the
time
she
thought
i
shall
go
to
that
prison
i
can
t
help
it
i
shan
t
be
able
to
keep
from
going
i
shall
go
to
that
prison
i
must
go
who
could
have
imagined
this
i
am
bound
to
go
and
i
shall
go
but
instead
of
objecting
totally
to
the
despatch
of
the
telegram
she
said
in
a
strange
voice
it
s
very
nice
of
you
you
fill
up
the
rest
of
the
form
said
harry
offering
the
pencil
what
must
i
put
well
you
d
better
put
countersigned
that
ll
fix
it
will
you

she
muttered
he
wrote
the
words
let
poor
mummy
see
alicia
complained
seizing
the
harry
called
out
leeks
a
gardener
half
hidden
by
foliage
across
the
garden
looked
up
sharply
saw
harry
s
beckoning
finger
and
approached
running
have
that
sent
off
for
me

said
harry
and
gave
leeks
the
form
and
a
florin
why
hilda

t
eating
anything
protested
alicia
i
only
want
tea
said
hilda
casually
wondering
whether
they
had
noticed
anything
wrong
in
her
face
ii
edwin
looking
curiously
out
of
the
as
the
train
from
plymouth
entered
tavistock
station
early
on
the
monday
was
surprised
to
perceive
harry
hesketh
on
the
platform
while
in
the
heavenly
air
of
the
september
morning
the
train
was
curving
through
bickleigh
vale
and
the
valley
of
the
plym
and
through
the
steeper
valley
of
the
meavy
up
towards
the
first
fastnesses
of
the
moor
he
had
felt
his
body
to
be
almost
miraculously
well
and
his
soul
almost
triumphant
but
when
he
saw
harry
the
remembered
figure
but
a
little
stouter
and
coarser
he
saw
a
being
easily
more
triumphant
than
himself
harry
had
great
reason
for
triumph
for
he
had
proved
himself
to
possess
a
genius
for
deductive
psychological
reasoning
and
for
prophecy
edwin
had
been
characteristically
vague
about
the
visit
first
he
had
telegraphed
that
he
could
not
come
business
preventing
then
he
had
telegraphed
that
he
would
come
but
only
on
sunday
and
he
had
given
no
particulars
of
trains
they
had
all
assured
one
another
that
this
was
just
like
edwin
the
man
s
mad
said
harry
with
genial
benevolence
and
had
set
himself
to
one
of
his
favourite
studies
bradshaw
he
always
handled
bradshaw
like
a
master
accomplishing
feats
of
interpretation
that
amazed
his
wife
he
had
announced
after
careful
connotations
that
edwin
was
perhaps
after
all
not
such
a
chump
but
that
he
was
in
fact
a
chump
in
that
having
chosen
the
route
he
had
erred
about
the
sunday
night
train
from
plymouth
to
tavistock
how
did
he
know
that
edwin
would
choose
the
route
well
his
knowledge
was
derived
from
divination
based
upon
vast
experience
of
human
nature
edwin
would
get
stuck
at
plymouth
he
would
sleep
at
plymouth
staying
at
the
royal
he
hoped
and
would
come
on
by
the
on
monday
arriving
at
where
he
would
be
met
by
harry
in
the
drawn
by
joan
the
telegraph
was
of
course
closed
after
on
sunday
but
if
it
had
been
open
and
he
had
been
receiving
hourly
despatches
about
edwin
s
tortuous
progress
through
england
harry
could
not
have
been
more
sure
of
his
position
and
on
the
monday
harry
had
risen
up
in
the
very
apogee
of
health
and
had
driven
joan
to
the
station
mark
my
words
he
had
said
i
shall
bring
him
back
with
me
for
breakfast
he
had
offered
to
take
hilda
to
the
station
to
witness
his
triumph
but
hilda
had
not
accepted
and
there
edwin
was
everything
had
happened
according
to
harry
s
prediction
except
that
from
an
unfortunate
modesty
edwin
had
gone
to
the
wrong
hotel
at
plymouth
they
shook
hands
in
a
glow
of
mutual
pleasure
how
on
earth
did
you
know
edwin
began
the
answer
rounded
off
harry
s
triumph
and
edwin
thought
why
he
s
just
like
a
boy
but
he
was
distinguished
his
in
all
its
decay
was
still
impressive
and
his
expansive
sincere
goodwill
was
utterly
delightful
also
the
station
neat
clean
solid
the
negation
of
all
gimcrackery
had
an
aspect
of
goodwill
to
man
its
advertisements
did
not
flare
and
it
seemed
to
be
the
expression
of
a
sound
and
race
the
silvern
guard
greeted
harry
with
deferential
heartiness
and
saluted
edwin
with
even
more
warmth
than
he
had
used
at
plymouth
on
the
sunday
edwin
had
noticed
that
in
the
western
country
guards
were
not
guards
as
in
other
parts
of
england
but
rather
the
cordial
hosts
of
their
trains
as
soon
as
the
doors
had
banged
in
a
fusillade
and
the
engine
whistled
a
young
porter
came
and
having
exchanged
civilities
with
harry
picked
up
edwin
s
bag
this
porter
s
face
and
demeanour
showed
perfect
content
his
slight
yet
eager
smile
and
his
quick
movements
seemed
to
be
saying
it
is
natural
and
proper
that
i
should
salute
you
and
carry
your
bag
while
you
walk
free
you
are
gentlemen
by
divine
right
and
by
the
same
right
i
am
a
railway
porter
and
happy
to
watch
the
man
at
his
job
gave
positive
pleasure
and
it
was
extraordinarily
reassuring
reassuring
about
everything
outside
the
station
the
groom
stood
at
joan
s
head
and
a
wonderful
sat
alert
under
the
instantly
the
dog
sprang
out
and
began
to
superintend
the
preparations
for
departure
rushing
to
and
fro
and
insisting
all
the
time
that
delay
would
be
monstrous
if
not
fatal
the
dog
s
excellence
as
a
specimen
of
breeding
was
so
superlative
as
to
accuse
its
breeder
and
owner
of
a
lack
of
perspective
in
life
it
was
as
if
the
entire
resources
of
civilization
had
been
employed
towards
the
perfecting
of
the
points
of
that
dog
balanced
the
cart
i
suppose
jos
asked
harry
kindly
yes
sir
was
all
that
jos
articulated
but
his
bright
face
said
sir
your
assumption
that
i
have
already
balanced
the
cart
for
three
and
a
bag
is
benevolent
and
justified
you
trust
me
i
trust
you
sir
all
is
well
the
bag
was
stowed
and
the
porter
got
threepence
and
was
so
happy
in
his
situation
that
apparently
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
the
scene
harry
climbed
up
on
the
right
edwin
on
the
left
the
dog
gave
one
short
bark
and
flew
madly
forward
jos
loosed
joan
s
head
and
at
the
same
moment
harry
gave
a
click
and
the
machine
started
it
did
not
wait
for
young
jos
jos
caught
the
back
step
as
the
machine
swung
by
and
levered
himself
dangerously
to
the
groom
s
place
and
when
he
had
done
it
he
grinned
announcing
to
beholders
that
his
mission
in
life
was
to
do
just
that
and
that
it
was
a
grand
life
and
he
a
lucky
and
enviable
fellow
harry
drove
across
the
tavy
and
through
the
small
grey
and
brown
town
so
picturesque
so
clean
so
solid
so
respectable
so
content
in
its
historicity
a
policeman
saluted
amiably
and
firmly
as
if
saying
i
am
protecting
all
this
what
a
treasure
then
they
passed
the
town
hall
town
hall
said
harry
oh
the
dook
s
said
harry
he
put
on
a
certain
facetiousness
but
there
nevertheless
escaped
from
him
the
conviction
that
the
ownership
of
a
town
hall
by
a
duke
was
a
wondrous
rare
phenomenon
and
fine
showing
the
strength
of
grand
english
institutions
and
traditions
and
meet
for
honest
english
pride
and
you
could
say
what
you
liked
about
progress
and
edwin
had
just
the
same
feeling
in
another
minute
they
were
out
of
the
town
the
countryside
though
bleak
with
its
spare
hedges
and
granite
walls
was
exquisitely
beautiful
in
the
morning
light
and
it
was
tidy
tended
mature
it
was
as
though
it
had
nothing
to
learn
from
the
future
beyond
rose
the
slopes
of
the
moor
tonic
and
grim
an
impression
of
health
moral
and
physical
everywhere
disengaged
itself
the
wayfarer
sturdy
and
benign
invigorated
by
his
mere
greeting
the
trot
of
the
horse
on
the
smooth
winding
road
the
bounding
of
the
dog
the
resilience
of
the
the
sharp
tang
of
the
air
on
the
cheek
all
helped
to
perfect
edwin
s
sense
of
pleasure
in
being
alive
he
could
not
deny
that
he
had
stood
in
need
of
a
change
he
had
been
worrying
perhaps
through
overwork
overwork
was
a
mistake
he
now
saw
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
happy
always
even
with
hilda
he
had
received
a
short
but
nice
and
almost
apologetic
letter
from
hilda
as
for
his
apprehensions
what
on
earth
did
it
matter
about
dartmoor
being
so
near
nothing
this
district
was
marvellously
reassuring
he
thought
there
simply
is
no
social
question
down
here
had
your
breakfast
asked
harry
yes
thanks
well
you
just
haven
t
then
said
harry
we
shall
be
in
the
nick
of
time
for
it
when
do
you
have
breakfast
nine
thirty
bit
late
isn
t
it
oh
no
it
suits
us
i
say
harry
stared
straight
between
the
horse
s
ears
what
harry
murmured
no
more
news
about
johnnie
i
suppose
edwin
glanced
half
round
at
the
groom
behind
harry
with
a
gesture
indicated
that
the
groom
was
negligible
not
that
i
ve
heard
bit
stiff
isn
t
it
edwin
answered
bit
stiff
i
should
rather
say
it
was
especially
after
jimmie
s
performance
rather
hard
lines
on
alicia
don
t
you
think
on
all
of
em
said
edwin
not
seeing
why
johnnie
s
escapade
should
press
more
on
alicia
than
for
example
on
janet
yes
of
course
harry
agreed
evidently
seeing
and
accepting
the
point
the
less
said
the
better
i
m
with
you
said
edwin
harry
resumed
his
jolly
tone
well
you
d
better
peck
a
bit
we
ve
planned
a
hard
day
for
you
oh
yes
early
lunch
and
then
we
re
going
to
drive
over
to
princetown
tennis
with
the
governor
of
the
prison
he
ll
show
us
all
over
the
prison
it
s
worth
seeing
impulsively
edwin
exclaimed
all
of
you
is
hilda
going
certainly
why
not
he
raised
the
whip
and
pointed
behold
our
noble
towers
edwin
feeling
really
sick
thought
hilda
s
mad
she
s
quite
mad
morbid
isn
t
the
word
he
was
confounded
iii
at
tavy
mansion
edwin
and
harry
were
told
by
a
maid
that
hesketh
and
miss
orgreave
were
in
the
nursery
and
would
be
down
in
a
moment
but
that
clayhanger
had
a
headache
and
was
remaining
in
bed
for
breakfast
the
master
of
the
house
himself
took
edwin
to
the
door
of
his
wife
s
bedroom
edwin
s
spirits
had
risen
in
an
instant
as
he
perceived
the
cleverness
of
hilda
s
headache
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
women
were
clever
though
perhaps
unscrupulously
and
crudely
clever
in
a
way
beyond
the
skill
of
men
by
the
simple
device
of
suffering
from
a
headache
hilda
had
avoided
the
ordeal
of
meeting
a
somewhat
estranged
husband
in
public
she
was
also
preparing
an
excuse
for
not
going
to
princetown
and
the
prison
certainly
it
was
better
in
the
dartmoor
affair
to
escape
at
the
last
moment
than
to
have
declined
the
project
from
the
start
as
he
opened
the
apprehensions
and
bright
hope
were
mingled
in
him
he
had
a
weighty
grievance
against
hilda
whose
behaviour
at
parting
had
been
he
considered
inexcusable
but
the
warm
tone
of
her
curt
private
telegram
to
him
and
of
her
almost
equally
curt
letter
her
passionate
love
was
really
equivalent
to
an
apology
which
he
accepted
with
eagerness
moreover
he
had
done
a
lot
in
coming
to
devonshire
and
for
this
great
act
he
lauded
himself
and
he
expected
some
gratitude
nevertheless
despite
the
pacificism
of
his
feelings
he
could
not
smile
when
entering
the
room
no
he
could
not
hilda
was
lying
in
the
middle
of
a
very
wide
bed
and
her
dark
hair
was
spread
abroad
upon
the
pillow
on
the
pedestal
was
a
squatted
comfortably
at
hilda
s
side
with
her
left
arm
as
a
support
was
a
baby
about
a
year
old
dressed
for
the
day
this
was
cecil
born
the
day
after
his
grandparents
funeral
cecil
with
mouth
open
and
outstretched
pink
hands
of
which
the
fingers
were
spread
like
the
rays
of
half
a
starfish
from
wide
eyes
gazed
at
edwin
with
a
peculiar
expression
of
bland
irony
hilda
smiled
lovingly
she
smiled
without
reserve
and
as
soon
as
she
smiled
edwin
could
smile
and
his
heart
was
suddenly
quite
light
hilda
thought
that
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
has
never
changed
and
it
never
will
imagine
him
travelling
on
sunday
when
the
silly
old
thing
might
just
as
well
have
come
on
saturday
if
he
d
had
anybody
to
decide
him
he
s
been
travelling
for
hours
or
more
and
now
he
s
here
what
a
shame
for
me
to
have
dragged
him
down
here
in
spite
of
himself
but
he
would
do
it
for
me
he
has
done
it
i
had
to
have
him
for
this
afternoon
after
all
he
must
be
very
good
at
business
everyone
respects
him
even
here
we
may
end
by
being
really
rich
have
i
ever
really
appreciated
him
and
now
of
course
he
s
going
to
be
annoyed
again
poor
boy
hello
who
s
this
cried
edwin
this
is
cecil
his
mummy
s
left
him
here
with
his
auntie
hilda
said
hilda
another
clever
dodge
of
hers
thought
edwin
he
liked
the
baby
being
there
he
approached
the
bed
and
staring
nervously
about
saw
that
his
bag
had
already
mysteriously
reached
the
bedroom
well
my
poor
boy
what
a
journey
hilda
murmured
compassionately
she
could
not
help
showing
that
she
was
his
mother
in
wisdom
and
sense
oh
no
he
amiably
dismissed
this
view
he
was
standing
over
her
by
the
bedside
she
looked
straight
up
at
him
timid
and
expectant
he
bent
and
kissed
her
under
his
kiss
she
shifted
slightly
in
the
bed
and
her
arms
clung
round
his
neck
and
by
her
arms
she
lifted
herself
a
little
towards
him
she
shut
her
eyes
she
would
not
loose
him
she
seemed
again
to
be
drawing
the
life
out
of
him
at
last
she
let
him
go
and
gave
a
great
sigh
all
the
past
which
did
not
agree
with
that
kiss
and
that
sigh
of
content
was
annihilated
and
an
immense
reassurance
filled
edwin
s
mind
so
you
ve
got
a
headache
she
gave
a
succession
of
little
nods
smiling
happily
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
come
dearest
she
said
after
a
pause
she
was
just
like
a
young
girl
like
a
child
in
her
relieved
satisfaction
what
about
george
well
as
it
was
left
to
me
to
decide
i
thought
i
d
better
ask
maggie
to
come
and
stay
in
the
house
much
better
than
packing
him
off
to
auntie
hamps
s
and
she
came
oh
yes
said
edwin
indifferently
as
if
to
say
of
course
she
came
then
you
did
get
my
letter
in
time
i
shouldn
t
have
got
it
in
time
if
i
d
left
saturday
morning
as
you
wanted
oh
and
here
s
a
letter
for
he
pulled
a
letter
from
his
pocket
the
envelope
was
of
the
peculiar
tinted
paper
with
which
he
had
already
been
familiarised
hilda
became
as
she
took
the
letter
and
opened
it
edwin
too
was
to
lighten
the
situation
he
put
his
little
finger
in
the
baby
s
mouth
cecil
much
appreciated
this
form
of
humour
and
as
soon
as
the
finger
was
withdrawn
from
his
toothless
gums
he
made
a
bubbling
whirring
noise
and
waved
his
arms
to
indicate
that
the
game
must
continue
hilda
frowning
read
the
letter
edwin
sat
down
ledging
himself
cautiously
on
the
brink
of
the
bed
and
leaned
back
a
little
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
at
the
baby
and
tickle
it
among
its
frills
from
the
distance
beyond
walls
he
could
hear
the
powerful
happy
cries
of
older
babies
beings
fully
aware
of
themselves
who
knew
their
own
sentiments
and
could
express
them
and
he
glanced
round
the
long
low
room
with
its
two
small
open
windows
showing
sunlit
yellow
cornfields
and
high
trees
and
its
monumental
furniture
and
the
disorder
of
hilda
s
clothes
and
implements
humanising
it
and
individualising
it
and
making
it
her
abode
her
lair
and
he
glanced
prudently
at
hilda
over
the
she
had
no
headache
it
was
obvious
that
she
had
no
headache
yet
in
the
most
innocent
touching
way
she
had
nodded
an
affirmative
to
his
question
about
the
headache
he
could
not
possibly
have
said
to
her
look
here
you
know
you
haven
t
got
a
headache
she
would
not
have
tolerated
the
truth
the
truth
would
have
made
her
transform
herself
instantly
into
a
martyr
and
him
into
a
brute
she
would
have
stuck
to
it
even
if
the
seat
of
eternal
judgment
had
suddenly
been
installed
at
the
brassy
foot
of
the
bed
that
she
had
a
headache
it
was
with
this
mentality
he
reflected
assuming
that
his
own
mentality
never
loved
anything
as
well
as
truth
that
he
had
to
live
till
one
of
them
expired
he
reminded
himself
wisely
that
the
woman
s
code
is
different
from
the
man
s
but
the
honesty
of
his
intelligence
rejected
such
an
explanation
such
an
excuse
it
was
not
that
the
woman
had
a
different
code
she
had
no
code
except
the
code
of
the
utter
opportunist
to
live
with
her
was
like
living
with
a
marvellous
wild
animal
full
of
grace
of
cunning
of
magnificent
passionate
gestures
of
terrific
affection
and
of
cruelty
she
was
at
once
indispensable
and
intolerable
he
felt
that
to
match
her
he
had
need
of
all
his
force
all
his
prescience
all
his
duplicity
the
mystery
that
had
lain
between
him
and
hilda
for
a
year
was
in
the
letter
within
two
feet
of
his
nose
he
could
watch
her
as
she
read
study
her
face
he
knew
that
he
was
the
wiser
of
the
two
she
was
at
a
disadvantage
as
regards
the
letter
she
was
fighting
on
ground
chosen
by
him
and
yet
he
could
not
in
the
least
foresee
the
next
ten
minutes
whether
she
would
advance
retreat
feint
or
surrender
did
you
bring
your
she
murmured
while
she
was
reading
she
had
instructed
him
in
her
letter
on
this
point
of
course
he
said
manfully
striving
to
imply
the
immense
untruth
that
he
never
stirred
from
home
without
his
she
continued
to
read
frowning
and
drawing
her
heavy
eyebrows
still
closer
together
then
she
said
here
and
passed
him
the
letter
he
could
see
now
that
she
was
becoming
excited
the
letter
was
from
the
legitimate
george
cannon
and
it
said
that
though
nothing
official
was
announced
or
even
breathed
her
solicitor
had
gathered
from
a
permanent
and
important
underling
of
the
home
office
that
george
cannon
s
innocence
was
supposed
to
be
established
and
that
the
queen
s
pardon
would
at
some
time
or
other
be
issued
it
was
an
affecting
letter
edwin
totally
ignorant
of
all
that
had
preceded
it
did
not
immediately
understand
its
significance
at
first
he
did
not
even
grasp
what
it
was
about
when
he
did
begin
to
comprehend
he
had
the
sensation
of
being
deprived
momentarily
of
his
bearings
he
had
expected
everything
but
this
that
is
to
say
he
had
absolutely
not
known
what
to
expect
the
shock
was
severe
is
it
is
it
he
questioned
as
if
impatient
hilda
replied
it
s
about
george
cannon
it
seems
he
was
quite
innocent
in
that
affair
it
s
his
wife
who
s
been
writing
to
me
about
it
i
don
t
know
why
she
should
but
she
did
and
of
course
i
had
to
reply
you
never
said
anything
to
me
about
it
i
didn
t
want
to
worry
you
dearest
i
knew
you
d
quite
enough
on
your
mind
with
the
works
besides
i
d
no
right
to
worry
you
with
a
thing
like
but
of
course
i
can
show
you
all
her
letters
i
ve
kept
them
unanswerable
unanswerable
insincere
concocted
but
unanswerable
the
implications
in
her
spoken
defence
were
of
the
simplest
and
deepest
ingenuity
and
withal
they
hurt
him
for
example
the
implication
that
the
strain
of
the
new
works
was
breaking
him
as
if
he
could
not
support
it
and
had
not
supported
it
easily
as
if
the
new
works
meant
that
he
could
not
fulfil
all
his
duties
as
a
helpmeet
and
then
the
devilishly
adroit
plea
that
her
concealment
was
morally
necessary
since
he
ought
not
to
be
troubled
with
any
result
of
her
life
and
finally
the
implication
that
he
would
be
jealous
of
the
correspondence
and
might
exact
the
production
of
it
he
now
callously
ignored
cecil
s
signals
for
attention
he
knew
that
he
would
receive
no
further
enlightenment
as
to
the
long
secrecy
of
the
past
twelve
months
his
fears
and
apprehensions
and
infelicity
were
to
be
dismissed
with
those
few
words
they
would
never
be
paid
for
redeemed
atoned
the
grand
scenic
explanation
and
submission
which
was
his
right
would
never
come
sentimentally
he
was
cheated
and
had
no
redress
and
as
a
climax
he
had
to
assume
to
pretend
that
justice
still
prevailed
on
earth
isn
t
it
awful
hilda
muttered
him
in
prison
all
this
time
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
wet
and
her
emotion
increasing
he
nodded
in
sympathy
he
thought
she
ll
want
some
handling
i
can
see
that
he
too
as
well
as
she
imaginatively
comprehended
the
dreadful
tragedy
of
george
cannon
s
false
imprisonment
he
had
heart
enough
to
be
very
glad
that
the
innocent
man
innocent
at
any
rate
of
that
one
thing
was
to
be
released
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
stifle
a
base
foreboding
and
regret
looking
at
his
wife
he
feared
the
moment
when
george
cannon
with
all
the
enormous
prestige
of
a
victim
in
a
woman
s
eyes
should
be
at
large
yes
the
lover
in
him
would
have
preferred
george
cannon
to
be
incarcerated
forever
had
he
not
heard
had
he
not
read
had
he
not
seen
on
the
stage
that
a
woman
never
forgets
the
first
man
nonsense
all
that
invented
theatrical
psychology
and
yet
if
it
was
true
look
at
her
eyes
i
suppose
he
innocent
he
said
gruffly
for
he
mistrusted
or
affected
to
mistrust
the
doings
of
these
two
women
together
cannon
s
wife
and
cannon
s
victim
might
they
not
somehow
have
been
hoodwinked
he
knew
nothing
no
useful
detail
naught
that
was
convincing
and
he
never
would
know
was
it
not
astounding
that
the
bigamist
should
have
both
these
women
on
his
side
either
working
for
him
or
weeping
over
his
woes
he
must
be
innocent
hilda
answered
thoughtfully
in
a
breaking
voice
where
is
he
now
up
yon
he
indicated
the
unvisited
heights
of
dartmoor
i
believe
so
i
thought
they
always
shifted
em
back
to
london
before
they
released
em
i
expect
they
will
do
they
may
have
moved
him
already
his
mood
grew
soft
indulgent
he
conceded
that
her
emotion
was
natural
she
had
been
bound
up
with
the
man
cannon
s
admitted
guilt
on
the
one
count
together
with
all
that
she
had
suffered
through
it
only
intensified
the
poignancy
of
his
innocence
on
the
other
count
contrary
to
the
general
assumption
you
must
be
sorrier
for
an
unfortunate
rascal
than
for
an
unfortunate
good
man
he
could
feel
all
that
he
edwin
was
to
be
pitied
but
nobody
save
himself
would
perceive
that
he
was
to
be
pitied
his
rôle
would
be
difficult
but
all
his
pride
and
commanded
him
to
play
it
well
using
every
resource
of
his
masculine
skill
and
so
prove
that
he
was
that
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
the
future
would
be
all
right
because
he
would
be
equal
to
the
emergency
why
should
it
not
be
all
right
his
heart
in
kindliness
and
tenderness
drew
nearer
to
hilda
s
and
he
saw
or
fancied
he
saw
that
all
their
guerilla
had
been
leading
up
to
this
had
perhaps
been
caused
by
this
and
would
be
nobly
ended
by
it
just
then
a
mysterious
noise
penetrated
the
room
growing
and
growing
until
it
became
a
huge
deafening
din
and
slowly
died
away
i
expect
that
s
breakfast
said
edwin
in
a
casual
tone
the
organism
of
the
english
household
was
functioning
even
in
the
withdrawn
calm
of
the
bedroom
they
could
feel
it
irresistibly
functioning
the
gong
had
a
physical
effect
on
cecil
all
his
disappointment
and
his
sense
of
being
neglected
were
gathered
up
in
his
throat
and
exploded
in
a
yell
hilda
took
him
in
her
right
arm
and
soothed
him
and
called
him
silly
names
edwin
rose
from
the
bed
and
as
he
did
so
hilda
retained
him
with
her
left
hand
and
pulled
him
very
gently
towards
her
inviting
a
kiss
he
kissed
her
she
held
to
him
he
could
see
at
a
distance
of
two
inches
all
the
dark
swimming
colour
of
her
wet
eyes
half
veiled
by
the
long
lashes
and
he
could
feel
the
soft
limbs
of
the
snuffling
baby
somewhere
close
to
his
head
you
d
better
stick
where
you
are
he
advised
her
in
a
casual
tone
hilda
thought
now
the
time
s
come
he
ll
be
furious
but
i
can
t
help
it
she
said
oh
no
i
shall
be
quite
all
right
soon
i
m
going
to
get
up
in
about
half
an
hour
but
then
how
shall
you
get
out
of
going
to
princetown
oh
edwin
i
must
go
i
told
them
i
should
go
he
was
astounded
there
was
no
end
to
her
incalculability
no
end
his
resentment
was
violent
he
stood
right
away
from
her
told
them
you
should
go
he
exclaimed
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
does
that
matter
are
you
absolutely
mad
she
stiffened
her
features
hardened
in
the
midst
of
her
terrible
relief
as
to
the
fate
of
george
cannon
and
of
her
equal
terrible
excitement
under
the
enigmatic
and
irresistible
mesmerism
of
dartmoor
prison
she
was
desperate
and
resentment
against
edwin
kindled
deep
within
her
she
felt
the
brute
in
him
she
felt
that
he
would
never
really
understand
she
felt
all
her
weakness
and
all
his
strength
but
she
was
determined
at
bottom
she
knew
well
that
her
weakness
was
the
stronger
i
must
go
she
repeated
it
s
nothing
but
morbidness
he
said
savagely
morbidness
well
i
shan
t
have
it
i
shan
t
let
you
go
and
that
s
flat
she
kept
silent
frightfully
disturbed
cursing
women
forgetting
utterly
in
a
moment
his
sublime
resolves
edwin
descended
to
breakfast
in
the
large
strange
house
existence
was
monstrous
and
before
the
middle
of
the
morning
hilda
came
into
the
garden
where
everyone
else
was
idling
and
alicia
and
janet
fondly
kissed
her
she
said
her
headache
had
vanished
sure
you
feel
equal
to
going
this
afternoon
dearest
asked
janet
oh
yes
hilda
replied
lightly
it
will
do
me
good
edwin
was
helpless
he
thought
recalling
with
vexation
his
last
firm
forbidding
words
to
hilda
in
the
bedroom
nobody
be
equal
to
this
emergency

xv
the
prison
i
harry
had
two
stout
and
fast
cobs
in
a
light
wagonette
he
drove
himself
and
hilda
sat
by
his
side
the
driver
s
boast
was
that
he
should
accomplish
the
ten
miles
with
a
rise
of
a
thousand
feet
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
a
hired
carriage
would
have
spent
two
hours
over
the
journey
it
was
when
they
had
cleared
the
town
and
were
on
the
long
straight
rise
across
the
moor
towards
longford
that
the
horses
began
to
prove
the
faith
that
was
in
them
eager
magnanimous
conceiving
grandly
the
splendour
of
their
task
in
life
and
irrepressibly
performing
it
with
glory
the
stones
on
the
road
flew
from
under
the
striding
of
their
hoofs
into
the
soft
dark
ling
on
either
hand
harry
s
whip
hovered
in
affection
over
their
twin
backs
never
touching
them
and
harry
smiled
mysteriously
to
himself
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
nor
did
hilda
the
movement
braced
and
intoxicated
her
and
rendered
thought
impossible
she
brimmed
with
emotion
like
a
vase
with
some
liquid
unanalysable
and
perilous
she
was
not
happy
she
was
not
unhappy
the
sensation
of
her
vitality
and
of
the
kindred
vitality
of
the
earth
and
the
air
was
overwhelming
she
would
have
prolonged
the
journey
indefinitely
and
yet
she
intensely
desired
the
goal
whatever
terrors
it
might
hold
for
her
at
intervals
she
pulled
up
the
embroidered
and
monogrammed
apron
that
slipped
slowly
down
over
her
skirt
and
over
harry
s
disclosing
two
rackets
in
a
press
that
lay
between
them
perhaps
harry
was
thinking
of
certain
strokes
at
tennis
longford
ejaculated
harry
turning
his
head
slightly
towards
the
body
of
the
vehicle
as
they
rattled
by
a
hamlet
soon
afterwards
the
road
mounted
steeply
five
hundred
feet
in
little
more
than
a
mile
and
the
horses
walked
but
they
walked
in
haste
fiercely
clawing
at
the
road
with
their
forefeet
and
thrusting
it
behind
them
and
some
of
the
large
tors
emerged
clearly
into
view
cox
tor
the
staple
tors
and
great
mis
lifting
its
granite
above
them
and
beyond
they
were
now
in
the
midst
of
the
moor
trotting
fast
again
behind
and
before
them
and
on
either
side
there
was
nothing
but
moor
and
sky
the
sky
a
vast
hemisphere
of
cloud
and
blue
and
sunshine
with
a
complex
and
ever
elusive
geography
of
its
own
discovered
all
the
tints
of
heath
and
granite
it
was
one
of
those
days
when
every
tint
was
divided
into
ten
thousand
shades
and
each
is
richer
and
more
softly
beautiful
than
the
others
on
the
shoulder
of
great
mis
rain
fell
while
little
vixen
tor
glittered
with
mica
points
in
the
sun
nothing
could
be
seen
over
the
whole
moor
save
here
and
there
a
pony
or
a
tiny
cottage
set
apart
in
solitude
and
the
yellowish
road
stretched
forward
wavily
narrowing
disappeared
for
a
space
reappeared
still
narrower
disappeared
once
more
reappeared
like
a
thin
meandering
line
and
was
lost
on
the
final
verge
it
was
an
endless
road
impossible
that
the
perseverance
of
horses
should
cover
it
yard
by
yard
but
the
horses
strained
onward
seeing
naught
but
the
macadam
under
their
noses
harry
checked
them
at
a
descent

he
announced
they
crossed
a
pebbly
stream
by
a
granite
bridge
said
harry
laconically
they
were
climbing
again
edwin
in
the
body
of
the
wagonette
with
janet
and
alicia
looked
for
and
saw
none
but
he
did
not
care
he
was
content
with
the
knowledge
that
prehistoric
were
somewhere
there
he
had
never
seen
wild
england
before
and
its
primeval
sanity
awoke
in
him
the
primeval
man
the
healthiness
and
simplicity
and
grandiose
beauty
of
it
created
the
sublime
illusion
that
civilisation
was
worthy
to
be
abandoned
the
five
towns
seemed
intolerable
by
their
dirt
and
ugliness
and
by
the
tedious
intricacy
of
their
existence
lithography
you
had
but
to
think
of
the
word
to
perceive
the
paltriness
of
the
thing
riches
properties
proprieties
all
the
safeties
futile
he
could
have
lived
alone
with
hilda
on
the
moor
begetting
children
by
her
watching
with
satisfaction
the
growing
curves
of
her
fecundity
his
work
and
seeing
her
with
her
brood
all
their
faces
beaten
by
wind
and
rain
and
browned
with
sun
he
had
a
tremendous
a
painful
longing
for
such
a
life
his
imagination
played
round
the
idea
of
it
with
voluptuous
and
pure
pleasure
and
he
wondered
that
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
he
felt
that
he
had
never
before
peered
into
the
depths
of
existence
and
though
he
knew
that
the
dream
of
such
an
arcadian
career
was
absurd
yet
he
seemed
to
guess
that
beneath
the
tiresome
surfaces
of
life
in
the
five
towns
the
essence
of
it
might
be
mystically
lived
and
he
thought
that
hilda
would
be
capable
of
sharing
it
with
him
nay
he
knew
she
would
his
mood
became
gravely
elated
even
optimistic
he
saw
that
he
had
worried
himself
about
nothing
if
she
wanted
to
visit
the
prison
let
her
visit
it
why
not
at
any
rate
he
should
not
visit
it
he
had
an
aversion
for
morbidity
almost
as
strong
as
his
aversion
for
sentimentality
but
her
morbidity
could
do
no
harm
she
could
not
possibly
meet
george
cannon
the
chances
were
utterly
against
such
an
encounter
her
morbidity
would
cure
itself
he
pitied
her
cherished
her
and
in
thought
enveloped
her
fondly
with
his
sympathetic
and
protective
wisdom

harry

with

afterwards

from

after

he
nodded
with
a
lively
responsive
smile
and
glanced
at
hilda
s
mysterious
back
only
once
during
the
journey
had
she
looked
round
alicia
with
her
coarse
kind
voice
and
laugh
began
to
rally
him
saying
he
had
dozed
a
town
more
granite
than
the
moor
itself
gradually
revealed
its
roofs
in
the
heart
of
the

a
chapel
a
heavy
followed
in
succession
there
were
pavements
a
brake
full
of
excursionists
had
halted
in
front
of
a
hotel
simple
folk
who
disliked
to
live
in
flocks
wandered
in
ecstatic
idleness
concealed
within
the
warmth
of
the
mountain
air
there
pricked
a
certain
sharpness
all
about
beyond
the
little
town
the
tors
raised
their
shaggy
flanks
surmounted
by
colossal
masses
of
stone
that
recalled
the
youth
of
the
planet
the
feel
of
the
world
was
stimulating
like
a
tremendous
tonic
then
the
wagonette
passed
a
thick
grove
of
trees
hiding
a
house
and
in
a
moment
like
magic
appeared
a
huge
gated
archway
of
brick
and
stone
and
over
it
the
incised
words
parcere

harry
cried
alicia
shrilly
what
are
you
doing
you

have

said
harry
all
right
two
be
it
noted
the
vehicle
came
to
a
standstill
and
instantly
clouds
of
vapour
rose
from
the
horses
virgil
thought
edwin
gazing
at
the
archway
which
filled
him
with
sudden
horror
like
an
obscenity
misplaced
ii
less
than
ten
minutes
later
he
and
hilda
and
alicia
together
with
three
strange
men
stood
under
the
archway
events
had
followed
one
another
quickly
to
edwin
s
undoing
when
the
wagonette
drew
up
in
the
grounds
of
the
governor
s
house
harry
hesketh
had
politely
indicated
that
for
his
horses
he
preferred
the
stables
of
a
certain
inn
down
the
road
to
any
stables
that
hospitality
might
offer
and
he
had
driven
off
rotherwas
urging
him
to
return
without
any
delay
so
that
tennis
might
begin
the
governor
had
been
called
from
home
and
in
his
absence
a
high
official
of
the
prison
was
deputed
to
show
the
visitors
through
the
establishment
this
official
was
the
first
of
the
three
strange
men
the
other
two
were
visitors
janet
had
said
that
she
would
not
go
over
the
prison
because
she
meant
to
play
tennis
and
wished
not
to
tire
herself
alicia
said
kindly
that
she
at
any
rate
would
go
with
hilda
though
she
had
seen
it
all
before
it
was
interesting
enough
to
see
again
edwin
had
thereupon
said
that
he
should
remain
with
janet
but
immediately
rotherwas
whose
reception
of
him
had
been
full
of
the
most
friendly
charm
had
shown
surprise
if
not
pain
what
come
to
princetown
without
inspecting
the
wonderful
prison
when
the
chance
was
there
inconceivable
edwin
might
in
his
blunt
five
towns
way
have
withstood
rotherwas
but
he
could
not
withstand
hilda
who
frowning
seemed
almost
ready
to
risk
a
public
altercation
in
order
to
secure
his
attendance
he
had
to
yield
to
make
a
scene
even
a
very
little
one
in
the
garden
full
of
light
dresses
and
polite
suave
voices
would
have
been
monstrous
he
thought
of
all
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
subjection
of
men
to
women
he
thought
of
johnnie
and
of
chris
hamson
who
was
known
for
her
steely
caprices
and
he
thought
also
of
jimmie
and
of
the
undesirable
jimmie
who
it
was
said
had
threatened
to
love
jimmie
no
more
unless
he
took
her
once
a
week
without
fail
to
the
theatre
whatever
the
piece
and
played
cards
with
her
and
two
of
her
friends
on
all
the
other
nights
of
the
week
he
thought
of
men
as
a
sex
conquered
by
the
unscrupulous
and
the
implacable
and
in
this
mood
superimposed
on
his
mood
of
disgust
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
archway
he
followed
the
high
official
and
his
train
rotherwas
s
last
words
were
that
they
were
not
to
be
long
but
the
official
said
privately
to
the
group
that
they
must
at
any
rate
approach
the
precincts
of
the
prison
with
all
ceremony
and
he
led
them
proudly
with
an
air
of
ownership
round
to
the
main
entrance
where
the
wagonette
had
first
stopped
a
turnkey
on
the
other
side
of
the
immense
gates
using
a
theatrical
gesture
jangled
a
great
bouquet
of
keys
the
portal
opened
increasing
the
pride
of
the
official
and
the
next
moment
they
were
interned
in
the
outer
courtyard
the
moor
and
all
that
it
meant
lay
unattainably
beyond
that
portal
as
the
group
slowly
crossed
the
enclosed
space
with
the
grim
façades
of
buildings
on
each
side
and
vistas
of
further
gates
and
buildings
in
front
the
official
and
the
two
male
visitors
began
to
talk
together
over
the
heads
of
alicia
and
hilda
the
women
held
close
to
each
other
and
the
official
kept
upon
them
a
chivalrous
eye
the
two
visitors
were
friends
edwin
was
left
out
of
the
social
scheme
and
lagged
somewhat
behind
like
one
who
is
not
wanted
but
who
can
not
be
abandoned
he
walked
miserable
resentful
and
darkly
angry
in
one
instant
the
three
men
had
estimated
him
decided
that
he
was
not
of
their
clan
nor
of
any
related
clan
and
ignored
him
whereas
the
official
and
the
two
male
visitors
who
had
never
met
before
grew
more
and
more
friendly
each
minute
one
said
that
he
did
not
know
of
the
scots
greys
but
he
knew
his
cousin
trevor
of
the
hussars
who
had
in
fact
married
a
niece
of
his
own
and
then
another
question
about
somebody
else
was
asked
and
immediately
they
were
engaged
in
following
clues
as
explorers
will
follow
the
intricate
mouths
of
a
great
delta
and
so
unite
in
the
main
stream
they
were
happy
edwin
did
not
seriously
mind
that
but
what
he
did
mind
was
their
accent
in
those
days
termed
throughout
the
midlands
an
onomatopoeic
description
which
falsifying
every
vowel
sound
in
the
language
and
several
consonants
magically
created
around
them
an
aura
of
utter
superiority
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
quite
unreasonably
hated
them
and
he
also
envied
them
because
this
accent
was
their
native
tongue
and
because
their
clothes
were
not
cut
like
his
and
because
they
were
entirely
at
their
ease
useless
for
the
official
to
throw
him
an
urbane
word
now
and
then
neither
his
hate
nor
his
constraint
would
consent
to
be
alleviated
the
urbane
words
grew
less
frequent
also
edwin
despised
them
because
they
were
seemingly
insensible
to
the
tremendous
horror
of
the
jail
set
there
like
an
outrage
in
the
midst
of
primitive
and
sane
dartmoor
yes
their
attitude
said
this
is
a
prison
one
of
the
institutions
necessary
to
the
well
being
of
society
like
a
workhouse
or
an
opera
house
an
interesting
sight
a
second
pair
of
iron
gates
were
opened
with
the
same
elaborate
theatricality
as
the
first
and
while
the
operation
was
being
done
the
official
invigorated
by
the
fawning
of
turnkeys
conversed
with
alicia
who
during
her
short
married
life
had
acquired
some
shallow
acquaintance
with
the
clans
and
he
even
drew
a
reluctant
phrase
from
hilda
then
after
another
open
space
came
a
third
pair
of
iron
gates
final
and
terrific
and
at
length
the
party
was
under
cover
and
even
the
sky
of
the
moor
was
lost
edwin
bored
disgusted
shamed
and
stricken
yielded
himself
proudly
and
submissively
to
the
horror
of
the
experience
iii
hilda
had
only
one
thought
would
she
catch
sight
of
the
innocent
prisoner
the
party
was
now
deeply
engaged
in
a
system
of
corridors
and
stairways
the
official
had
said
that
as
the
tour
of
inspection
was
to
be
short
he
would
display
to
them
chiefly
the
modern
part
of
the
prison
so
far
not
a
prisoner
had
been
seen
and
scarcely
a
warder
the
two
male
visitors
were
scientifically
interested
in
the
question
of
escapes
did
prisoners
ever
escape
never
said
the
official
with
satisfaction
impossible
i
suppose
even
when
they
re
working
out
on
the
moor
warders
are
pretty
good
shots
eh
practically
impossible
said
the
official
but
there
is
one
way
he
looked
up
the
stairway
on
whose
landing
they
stood
and
down
the
stairway
and
cautiously
lowered
his
voice
of
course
what
i
tell
you
is
confidential
if
one
of
our
dartmoor
fogs
came
on
suddenly
and
kind
friends
outside
had
hidden
a
stock
of
clothes
and
food
in
an
arranged
spot
then
theoretically
i
say
theoretically
a
man
might
get
away
but
nobody
ever
has
done
i
suppose
you
still
have
the
silent
system
the
official
nodded
absolutely
absolutely
how
awful
it
must
be
said
alicia
with
a
nervous
laugh
the
official
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
the
other
two
males
murmured
reassuring
axioms
about
discipline
they
emerged
from
the
stairway
into
a
colossal
and
resounding
iron
hall
round
the
emptiness
of
this
interior
ran
galleries
of
perforated
iron
protected
from
the
abyss
by
iron
balustrades
the
group
stood
on
the
second
of
the
galleries
from
the
stony
floor
and
there
were
two
galleries
above
them
far
away
opposite
a
glint
of
sunshine
had
feloniously
slipped
in
transpiercing
the
gloom
and
it
lighted
a
series
of
doors
there
was
a
row
of
these
doors
along
every
gallery
each
had
a
a
and
a
number
the
longer
hilda
regarded
the
more
nightmarishly
numerous
seemed
the
doors
the
place
was
like
a
huge
designed
for
the
claustration
of
countless
rabbits
across
the
whole
width
and
length
of
the
hall
and
at
the
level
of
the
lowest
gallery
was
stretched
a
great
net
to
provide
against
suicides
suggested
one
of
the
men
yes
said
the
official
a
good
idea
when
the
reverberation
of
the
words
had
ceased
a
little
silence
ensued
the
ear
listened
vainly
for
the
slightest
sound
in
the
silence
the
implacability
of
granite
walls
and
iron
reticulations
reigned
over
the
accursed
vision
stultifying
the
soul
are
these
cells
occupied
asked
alicia
timidly
not
yet
hesketh
it
s
too
soon
a
few
are
hilda
thought
he
may
be
here
behind
one
of
those
doors
her
heart
was
liquid
with
compassion
and
revolt
no
she
assured
herself
they
must
have
taken
him
away
already
it
s
impossible
he
should
be
here
he
s
innocent
perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
one
of
the
cells
the
official
suggested
a
warder
appeared
and
with
the
inescapable
jangle
of
keys
opened
a
door
the
party
entered
the
cell
ladies
first
then
the
official
and
his
new
acquaintances
then
edwin
trailing
the
cell
was
long
and
narrow
fairly
lofty
colour
very
dimly
lighted
by
a
tiny
grimed
window
high
up
in
a
wall
of
extreme
thickness
the
bed
lay
next
the
long
wall
except
the
bed
a
stool
a
shelf
and
some
utensils
there
was
nothing
to
furnish
the
horrible
nakedness
of
the
cell
one
of
the
visitors
picked
up
an
old
book
from
the
shelf
it
was
a
greek
testament
the
party
seemed
astonished
at
this
evidence
of
culture
among
prisoners
of
the
height
from
which
a
criminal
may
have
fallen
the
official
smiled
they
often
ask
for
such
things
on
purpose
said
he
they
think
it
s
effective
they
re
very
naïve
you
know
at
bottom
this
very
cell
may
be
his
cell
thought
hilda
he
may
have
been
here
all
these
months
years
knowing
he
was
innocent
he
may
have
thought
about
me
in
this
cell
she
glanced
cautiously
at
edwin
but
edwin
would
not
catch
her
eye
they
left
on
the
way
to
the
workshops
they
had
a
glimpse
of
the
old
parts
of
the
prison
used
during
the
napoleonic
wars
incredibly
dark
frowsy
like
catacombs
we
don
t
use
this
part
unless
we
re
very
full
up
said
the
official
and
he
contrasted
it
with
the
bright
spacious
healthy
excellences
of
the
hall
which
they
had
just
quitted
to
prove
that
civilisation
never
stood
still
and
then
suddenly
at
the
end
of
a
passage
a
door
opened
and
they
were
in
the
tailors
shop
a
large
irregular
apartment
full
of
a
strong
stench
and
of
squatted
and
grotesque
human
beings
the
human
beings
for
the
most
part
were
clothed
in
a
peculiar
brown
stuff
covered
with
broad
arrows
the
dress
consisted
of
a
short
jacket
baggy
knickerbockers
black
stockings
and
coloured
shoes
their
hair
was
cut
so
short
that
they
had
the
appearance
of
being
bald
and
their
great
ears
protruded
at
a
startling
angle
from
the
sides
of
those
smooth
heads
they
were
of
every
age
yet
they
all
looked
alike
ridiculous
pantomimic
appalling
some
gazed
with
indifference
at
the
visitors
others
seemed
oblivious
of
the
entry
they
all
stitched
on
their
haunches
in
the
stench
under
the
surveillance
of
eight
armed
warders
in
blue
how
many
asked
the
official
mechanically
sir
said
a
warder
and
hilda
searched
their
loathsome
and
vapid
faces
for
the
face
of
george
cannon
he
was
not
there
she
trembled
whether
with
relief
or
with
disappointment
she
knew
not
she
was
agonised
but
in
her
torture
she
exulted
that
she
had
come
no
comment
had
been
made
in
the
workshop
the
official
having
hinted
that
silence
was
usual
on
such
occasions
but
in
a
kind
of
antechamber
one
of
those
amorphous
spaces
serving
no
purpose
and
resembling
nothing
which
are
sometimes
to
be
found
between
definable
rooms
and
corridors
in
a
vast
building
imperfectly
planned
the
party
halted
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
as
to
discipline
the
male
visitors
except
edwin
showed
marked
intelligence
and
detachment
they
seemed
to
understand
immediately
how
it
was
that
ruffians
could
be
trusted
to
squat
on
their
thighs
and
stitch
industriously
and
use
scissors
and
other
weapons
for
hours
without
being
chained
to
the
ground
they
certainly
knew
something
of
the
handling
of
men
the
official
triumphant
stated
that
every
prisoner
had
the
right
of
personal
appeal
to
the
governor
every
day
they
come
with
their
stories
of
grievances
said
he
tolerant
and
derisive
which
often
aren
t
true
which
are
never
true
said
the
official
quietly
never
they
are
always
lies
always
shows
the
material
we
have
to
deal
with
he
gave
a
short
laugh
really
said
one
of
the
men
rather
pleased
and
excited
by
this
report
of
universal
lying
i
suppose
edwin
blurted
out
you
can
tell
for
certain
when
they
aren
t
speaking
the
truth
everybody
looked
at
him
surprised
as
though
the
dumb
had
spoken
the
official
s
glance
showed
some
suspicion
of
sarcasm
and
a
tendency
to
resent
it
we
can
he
answered
shortly
commanding
his
features
to
a
faint
smile
and
now
i
wonder
what
rotherwas
will
be
saying
if
i
don
t
restore
you
to
her
it
was
agreed
that
regard
must
be
had
for
rotherwas
s
hospitable
arrangements
though
the
prison
was
really
very
interesting
and
would
repay
study
they
entered
a
wide
corridor
one
of
two
that
met
at
in
the
amorphous
space
leading
in
the
direction
of
the
chief
entrance
from
the
end
of
this
corridor
a
file
of
convicts
was
approaching
in
charge
of
two
warders
with
guns
the
official
offered
no
remark
but
held
on
hilda
falling
back
near
to
edwin
in
the
procession
was
divided
between
a
dreadful
fear
and
a
hope
equally
dreadful
except
in
the
tailors
shop
these
were
the
only
prisoners
they
had
seen
and
they
appeared
out
of
place
in
the
of
the
corridor
for
nobody
could
conceive
a
prisoner
save
in
a
cell
or
shop
and
these
were
moving
in
a
public
corridor
unshackled
then
she
distinguished
george
cannon
among
them
he
was
the
third
from
the
last
she
knew
him
by
his
nose
and
the
shape
of
his
chin
and
by
his
walk
though
there
was
little
left
of
his
proud
walk
in
the
desolating
hopeless
which
was
the
gait
of
all
six
convicts
his
hair
was
all
these
details
she
could
see
and
be
sure
of
in
the
distance
of
the
dim
corridor
she
no
longer
had
a
stomach
it
had
gone
and
yet
she
felt
a
horrible
nausea
she
cried
out
to
herself
why
did
i
come
why
did
i
come
i
am
always
doing
these
mad
things
edwin
was
right
why
do
i
not
listen
to
him
the
party
of
visitors
led
by
the
high
official
and
the
file
of
convicts
in
charge
of
armed
warders
were
gradually
approaching
one
another
in
the
wide
corridor
it
seemed
to
hilda
that
a
fearful
collision
was
imminent
and
that
something
ought
to
be
done
but
nobody
among
the
visitors
did
anything
or
seemed
to
be
disturbed
only
they
had
all
fallen
silent
and
in
the
echoing
corridor
could
be
heard
the
firm
steps
of
the
male
visitors
accompanying
the
delicate
tripping
of
the
women
and
the
military
tramp
of
the
warders
with
the
confused
shuffling
of
the
convicts
has
he
recognised
me
thought
hilda
wildly
she
hoped
that
he
had
and
that
he
had
not
she
recalled
with
the
most
poignant
sorrow
the
few
days
of
their
union
their
hours
of
intimacy
his
kisses
her
secret
realisation
of
her
power
over
him
and
of
his
passion
she
wanted
to
scream
that
man
there
is
as
innocent
as
any
of
you
and
soon
the
whole
world
will
know
it
he
never
committed
any
crime
except
that
of
loving
me
too
much
he
could
not
do
without
me
and
so
i
was
his
ruin
it
is
horrible
that
he
should
be
here
in
this
hell
he
must
be
set
free
at
once
the
home
secretary
knows
he
is
innocent
but
they
are
so
slow
how
can
anyone
bear
that
he
should
stop
here
one
instant
longer
but
she
made
no
sound
the
tremendous
force
of
an
ancient
and
organised
society
kept
her
lips
closed
and
her
feet
in
a
line
with
the
others
she
thought
in
despair
we
are
getting
nearer
and
i
can
not
meet
him
i
shall
drop
she
glanced
at
edwin
as
if
for
help
but
edwin
was
looking
straight
ahead
then
a
warder
stopping
ejaculated
with
the
harsh
brevity
of
a
halt
the
file
halted
right
turn
the
six
captives
turned
with
their
faces
close
against
the
wall
of
the
corridor
obedient
humiliated
spiritless
limp
stooping
their
backs
presented
the
most
ridiculous
aspect
all
the
calculated
grotesquerie
of
the
surpassingly
ugly
prison
uniform
was
accentuated
as
they
stood
thus
a
row
of
living
scarecrows
who
knew
that
they
had
not
the
right
even
to
look
upon
free
men
every
one
of
them
except
george
cannon
had
large
protuberant
ears
that
completed
the
monstrosity
of
their
appearance
the
official
gave
his
new
acquaintances
a
satisfied
glance
as
if
saying
that
is
the
rule
by
which
we
manage
these
chance
encounters
the
visitors
went
by
in
silence
instinctively
edging
away
from
the
captives
and
as
she
passed
hilda
lurched
very
heavily
against
edwin
and
recovered
herself
edwin
seized
her
arm
near
the
shoulder
and
saw
that
she
was
pale
the
others
were
in
front
behind
them
they
could
hear
the
warder
left
turn
march
and
the
shuffling
and
the
tramping
recommenced
iv
in
the
garden
of
the
governor
s
house
tennis
had
already
begun
when
the
official
brought
back
his
convoy
young
truscott
and
rotherwas
were
pitted
against
harry
hesketh
and
a
girl
of
eighteen
who
possessed
a
good
wrist
but
could
not
keep
her
head
harry
was
watching
over
his
partner
quietly
advising
her
upon
the
ruses
of
the
enemy
taking
the
more
difficult
strokes
for
her
and
generally
imparting
to
her
the
quality
which
she
lacked
harry
was
fully
engaged
the
whole
of
his
brain
and
body
was
at
strain
he
let
nothing
go
by
he
missed
no
chance
and
within
the
laws
of
the
game
he
hesitated
at
no
stratagem
and
he
was
beating
young
truscott
and
rotherwas
while
an
increasing
and
polite
audience
looked
on
to
the
entering
party
the
withdrawn
scene
lit
by
sunshine
appeared
as
perfect
as
a
with
its
trees
lawn
flowers
toilettes
the
flying
balls
the
grace
of
the
players
and
the
grey
solidity
of
the
governor
s
house
in
the
background
alicia
ran
gawkily
to
janet
who
had
got
a
box
of
chocolates
from
somewhere
and
one
of
the
men
followed
her
laughing
hilda
sat
apart
she
was
less
pale
edwin
remained
cautiously
near
her
he
had
not
left
her
side
since
she
lurched
against
him
in
the
corridor
he
knew
he
had
divined
that
that
which
he
most
feared
had
come
to
pass
the
supreme
punishment
of
hilda
s
morbidity
he
had
not
definitely
recognised
george
cannon
for
he
was
not
acquainted
with
him
and
in
the
past
had
only
once
or
twice
by
chance
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
streets
of
bursley
or
turnhill
but
he
had
seen
among
the
six
captives
one
who
might
be
he
and
who
certainly
had
something
of
the
five
towns
look
hilda
s
lurch
told
him
that
by
vindictiveness
of
fate
george
cannon
was
close
to
them
he
had
ignored
his
own
emotion
the
sudden
transient
weight
of
hilda
s
body
had
had
a
strange
moral
effect
upon
him
this
he
thought
is
the
burden
i
have
to
bear
this
and
not
lithography
nor
riches
is
my
chief
concern
she
depends
on
me
i
am
all
she
has
to
stand
by
the
burden
with
its
immense
and
complex
responsibilities
was
sweet
to
his
inmost
being
and
it
braced
him
and
destroyed
his
resentment
against
her
morbidity
his
pity
was
pure
he
felt
that
he
must
live
more
nobly
yes
more
heroically
than
he
had
been
living
that
all
irritable
pettiness
must
drop
away
from
him
and
that
his
existence
in
her
regard
must
have
simplicity
and
grandeur
the
sensation
of
her
actual
weight
stayed
with
him
he
had
not
spoken
to
her
he
dared
not
he
had
scarcely
met
her
eyes
but
he
was
ready
for
any
emergency
every
now
and
then
in
the
garden
hilda
glanced
over
her
shoulder
at
the
house
as
though
her
gaze
could
pierce
the
house
and
see
the
sinister
prison
beyond
the
set
ended
to
harry
hesketh
s
satisfaction
and
another
set
being
arranged
he
and
rotherwas
athletic
in
a
short
skirt
and
simple
blouse
came
walking
rather
flushed
and
breathless
round
the
garden
with
one
or
two
others
including
harry
s
late
partner
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
great
south
wales
colliery
strike
against
a
proposed
reduction
of
wages
rotherwas
husband
was
a
colliery
proprietor
near
monmouth
and
she
had
just
received
a
letter
from
him
everyone
sympathised
with
her
and
her
husband
and
nobody
could
comprehend
the
wrongheadedness
of
the
miners
except
upon
the
supposition
that
they
had
been
led
away
by
mischievous
demagogues
as
the
group
approached
the
timid
young
girl
having
regained
her
nerve
was
exclaiming
with
honest
indignation
the
leaders
ought
to
be
shot
and
the
men
who
won
t
go
down
the
pits
ought
to
be
forced
to
go
down
and
made
to
work
and
she
picked
at
fluff
on
her
yellow
frock
edwin
feared
an
uprising
from
hilda
but
naught
happened
rotherwas
spoke
about
tea
though
it
was
rather
early
and
they
all
hilda
as
well
wandered
to
a
large
yew
tree
under
which
was
a
table
through
the
pendant
branches
of
the
tree
the
tennis
could
be
watched
as
through
a
screen
the
prison
clock
tolled
the
hour
over
the
roofs
of
the
house
and
rotherwas
gave
the
definite
signal
for
refreshments
you
re
exhausted
she
said
teasingly
to
harry
you
ll
see
said
harry
no
rotherwas
delightfully
relented
you
re
a
dear
and
i
love
to
watch
you
play
i
m
sure
you
could
give
truscott
half
fifteen
think
so
said
harry
pleased
and
very
conscious
that
he
was
living
fully
you
see
what
it
is
to
have
an
object
in
life
hesketh
edwin
remarked
suddenly
harry
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
and
yet
with
a
certain
ingenuous
admiration
at
the
same
time
a
white
ball
rolled
near
the
tree
he
ducked
under
the
trailing
branches
returned
the
ball
and
moved
slowly
towards
the
court
alicia
tells
me
you
re
very
old
friends
of
theirs
said
rotherwas
agreeably
to
hilda
hilda
smiled
quietly
yes
we
are
both
of
us
who
could
have
guessed
now
that
her
condition
was
not
absolutely
normal
charming
people
aren
t
they
the
heskeths
said
rotherwas
perfectly
charming
they
re
an
ideal
couple
and
i
do
like
their
house
it
s
so
deliciously
quaint
isn
t
it
mary
lovely
agreed
the
young
girl
it
was
an
ideal
world
full
of
ideal
beings
soon
after
tea
the
irresistible
magnetism
of
alicia
s
babies
drew
alicia
off
the
moor
and
with
her
the
champion
player
janet
hilda
and
edwin
rotherwas
let
them
go
with
regret
adorably
expressed
harry
would
have
liked
to
stay
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
delightfully
ready
to
yield
to
alicia
v
on
arriving
at
tavy
mansion
hilda
announced
that
she
should
lie
down
she
told
edwin
in
an
exhausted
but
friendly
voice
that
she
needed
only
rest
and
he
comprehended
rightly
that
he
was
to
leave
her
not
a
word
was
said
between
them
as
to
the
events
within
the
prison
he
left
her
and
spent
the
time
before
dinner
with
harry
hesketh
who
had
the
idea
of
occupying
their
leisure
with
a
short
game
of
bowls
for
which
it
was
necessary
to
remove
the
croquet
hoops
hilda
undressed
and
got
into
bed
soon
afterwards
both
alicia
with
an
infant
and
janet
came
to
see
her
had
janet
been
alone
hilda
might
conceivably
in
her
weakness
have
surrendered
the
secret
to
her
in
exchange
for
that
soft
and
persuasive
sympathy
of
which
janet
was
the
mistress
but
the
presence
of
alicia
made
a
confidence
impossible
and
hilda
was
glad
she
plausibly
fibbed
to
both
sisters
and
immediately
afterwards
the
household
knew
that
hilda
would
not
appear
at
dinner
there
was
not
the
slightest
alarm
or
apprehension
for
the
affair
explained
itself
in
the
simplest
way
hilda
had
had
a
headache
in
the
morning
and
had
been
wrong
to
go
out
she
was
now
merely
paying
for
the
indiscretion
she
would
be
quite
recovered
the
next
day
alicia
whispered
a
word
to
her
husband
who
besides
was
not
apt
easily
to
get
nervous
about
anything
except
his
form
at
games
edwin
also
with
his
five
towns
habit
of
mind
soberly
belittled
the
indisposition
the
household
remained
natural
and
gay
when
edwin
went
upstairs
to
prepare
for
dinner
moving
very
quietly
his
wife
had
her
face
towards
the
wall
and
away
from
the
light
he
came
round
the
bed
to
look
at
her
i
m
all
right
she
murmured
want
nothing
at
all
he
asked
with
nervous
gruffness
she
shook
her
head
very
impatiently
she
awaited
his
departure
exasperated
more
than
she
had
ever
been
by
his
precise
deliberation
over
certain
details
of
his
toilet
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
she
began
to
cry
but
the
tears
came
so
gently
from
her
eyes
that
the
weeping
was
as
passive
as
independent
of
volition
as
the
escape
of
blood
from
a
wound
she
had
a
grievance
against
edwin
at
the
crisis
in
the
prison
she
had
blamed
herself
for
not
submitting
to
his
guidance
but
now
she
had
reacted
against
all
such
accusations
and
her
grievance
amounted
to
just
an
indictment
of
his
commonsense
his
quietude
his
talent
for
keeping
out
of
harm
s
way
his
lack
of
violent
impulses
his
formidable
respectability
she
was
a
rebel
he
was
not
he
would
never
do
anything
wrong
or
even
perilous
never
never
would
he
find
himself
in
need
of
a
friend
s
help
he
would
always
direct
his
course
so
that
society
would
protect
him
he
was
a
firm
part
of
the
structure
of
society
he
was
the
enemy
of
impulses
when
he
foresaw
a
danger
the
danger
was
always
realised
she
had
noticed
that
and
she
resented
it
he
was
infinitely
above
the
george
cannons
of
the
world
he
would
be
incapable
of
bigamy
incapable
of
being
caught
in
circumstances
which
could
bring
upon
him
suspicion
of
any
crime
whatever
yet
for
her
the
george
cannons
had
a
quality
which
he
lacked
which
he
could
never
possess
and
which
would
have
impossibly
perfected
him
a
quality
heroic
foolish
she
was
almost
ready
to
decide
that
his
complete
social
security
was
due
to
cowardice
and
resulted
in
could
he
really
feel
pity
as
she
felt
it
for
the
despised
and
rejected
and
a
hatred
of
injustice
equal
to
hers
these
two
emotions
were
burning
her
up
again
and
again
ceaselessly
her
mind
ran
round
the
circle
of
george
cannon
s
torture
and
the
callousness
of
society
he
had
sinned
and
she
had
loathed
him
but
both
his
sin
and
her
loathing
were
the
fruit
of
passion
he
had
been
a
proud
man
and
she
had
shared
his
pride
now
he
was
broken
unutterably
humiliated
and
she
partook
of
his
humiliation
the
grotesque
and
beaten
animal
in
the
corridor
was
all
that
society
had
left
of
him
who
had
once
inspired
her
to
acts
of
devotion
who
could
make
her
blush
and
to
satisfy
whom
she
would
recklessly
spend
herself
the
situation
was
intolerable
and
yet
it
had
to
be
borne
but
surely
it
must
be
ended
surely
at
the
latest
on
the
morrow
the
prisoner
must
be
released
and
soothed
and
reinstated
pardoned
no
a
pardon
was
an
insult
worse
than
an
insult
she
would
not
listen
to
the
word
society
might
use
it
for
its
own
purposes
but
she
would
never
use
it
pardon
a
man
after
deliberately
and
fiendishly
achieving
his
ruin
she
could
have
laughed
exhaustion
followed
tempering
emotion
and
reducing
it
to
a
profound
despairing
melancholy
that
was
stirred
at
intervals
by
frantic
revolt
the
light
failed
the
windows
became
vague
silver
squares
outside
fowls
clucked
a
horse
s
hoof
clattered
on
stones
servants
spoke
to
each
other
in
their
rough
voices
the
peace
of
the
world
had
its
effect
on
her
unwilling
though
she
was
then
there
was
a
faint
tap
at
the
door
she
made
no
reply
and
shut
her
eyes
the
door
gently
opened
and
someone
tripped
delicately
in
she
heard
movements
at
the
washstand
one
of
the
maids
a
match
was
struck
the
blinds
were
stealthily
lowered
the
curtains
drawn
garments
were
gathered
together
and
at
last
the
door
closed
again
she
opened
her
eyes
the
room
was
very
dimly
illuminated
a
under
a
glass
hemisphere
of
pale
rose
stood
on
the
by
magic
order
had
been
restored
a
glinting
copper
ewer
of
hot
water
stood
in
the
whiteness
of
the
basin
with
a
towel
over
it
the
blue
blinds
revealed
by
the
narrowness
of
the
red
curtains
stirred
in
the
depths
of
the
windows
each
detail
of
the
chamber
was
gradually
disclosed
and
the
chamber
was
steeped
in
the
first
tranquillity
of
the
night
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
through
the
depths
of
her
bitterness
there
rose
slowly
the
sensation
of
the
beauty
of
existence
even
in
its
sadness
a
long
time
afterwards
it
occurred
to
her
in
the
obscurity
that
the
bed
was
tumbled
she
must
have
turned
over
and
over
the
bed
must
be
arranged
before
edwin
came
he
had
to
share
it
after
all
he
had
committed
no
fault
he
was
entirely
innocent
she
and
fate
between
them
had
inflicted
these
difficulties
and
these
solicitudes
upon
him
he
had
said
little
or
nothing
but
he
was
sympathetic
when
she
had
stumbled
against
him
she
had
felt
his
upholding
masculine
strength
he
was
dependable
and
would
be
dependable
to
the
last
the
bed
must
be
creaseless
when
he
came
this
was
the
least
she
could
do
she
arose
very
faintly
she
could
descry
her
image
in
the
mirror
of
the
great
wardrobe
a
dishevelled
image
forgetting
the
bed
she
bathed
her
face
and
unusually
took
care
to
leave
the
washstand
as
tidy
as
the
maid
had
left
it
then
having
arranged
her
hair
she
set
about
the
bed
it
was
not
easy
for
one
person
unaided
to
make
a
wide
bed
before
she
had
finished
she
heard
footsteps
outside
the
door
she
stood
still
then
she
heard
edwin
s
voice
don
t
trouble
thanks
i
ll
take
it
in
myself
he
entered
carrying
a
tray
and
shut
the
door
and
instantly
she
busied
herself
once
more
with
the
bed
my
poor
girl
he
said
with
quiet
kindliness
what
are
you
doing
i
m
just
putting
the
bed
to
rights
she
answered
and
almost
with
a
single
movement
she
slid
back
into
the
bed
what
have
you
got
there
i
thought
i
d
ask
for
some
tea
for
you
he
said
nearly
the
whole
blessed
household
wanted
to
come
and
see
you
but
i
wouldn
t
have
it
she
could
not
say
it
s
very
nice
of
you
but
she
said
simply
to
please
him
i
should
like
some
tea
he
put
the
tray
on
the
then
lit
three
candles
two
on
the
and
one
on
the
and
brought
the
tray
to
the
he
himself
poured
out
the
tea
and
offered
the
cup
she
raised
herself
on
an
elbow
did
you
recognise
him
she
muttered
suddenly
after
she
had
blown
on
the
tea
to
cool
it
under
ordinary
conditions
edwin
would
have
replied
to
such
an
unprepared
question
with
another
petulant
and
impatient
recognise
who
pretending
that
he
did
not
understand
the
allusion
but
now
he
made
no
pretences
not
quite
he
said
but
i
knew
at
once
i
could
see
which
of
them
it
must
be
the
subject
at
last
opened
between
them
hilda
felt
an
extraordinary
solace
and
relief
he
stood
by
the
bedside
in
black
with
a
great
breastplate
of
white
his
hair
rough
his
hands
in
his
pockets
she
thought
he
had
a
fine
face
she
thought
of
him
as
at
such
a
time
her
superior
she
wanted
powerfully
to
adopt
his
attitude
to
believe
in
everything
he
said
they
were
talking
together
in
safety
quietly
gravely
amicably
withdrawn
and
safe
in
the
strange
house
he
benevolent
and
assuaging
and
comprehending
she
desiring
the
balm
which
he
could
give
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
had
never
talked
to
each
other
in
such
tones
isn
t
it
awful
awful
she
exclaimed
it
is
said
edwin
and
added
carefully
tenderly
i
suppose
he
innocent
she
might
have
flown
at
him
that
s
just
like
you
to
assume
he
isn
t
but
she
replied
i
m
quite
sure
of
it
i
say
i
want
you
to
read
all
the
letters
i
ve
had
from
cannon
i
ve
got
them
here
they
re
in
my
bag
there
read
them
now
of
course
i
always
meant
to
show
them
to
you
all
right
he
agreed
drew
a
chair
to
the
where
the
bag
was
found
the
letters
and
read
them
she
waited
as
he
read
one
letter
put
it
down
read
another
laid
it
precisely
upon
the
first
one
with
his
terrible
exactitude
and
orderliness
and
so
on
through
the
whole
packet
yes
said
he
at
the
end
i
should
say
he
s
innocent
this
time
right
enough
but
something
ought
to
be
done
she
cried
don
t
you
think
something
ought
to
be
done
edwin
something
has
been
done
something
is
being
done
but
something
else
he
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
there
s
only
one
thing
to
be
done
he
said
he
came
towards
her
and
stood
over
her
again
and
the
candle
on
the
lighted
his
chin
and
the
space
between
his
eyelashes
and
his
eyebrows
he
timidly
touched
her
hair
caressing
it
they
were
absolutely
at
their
ease
together
in
the
intimacy
of
the
bedroom
in
her
brief
relations
with
george
cannon
there
had
not
been
time
to
establish
anything
like
such
intimacy
with
george
cannon
she
had
always
had
the
tremors
of
the
fawn
what
is
it
wait
that
s
all
it
s
not
the
slightest
use
trying
to
hurry
these
public
departments
you
can
t
do
it
you
only
get
annoyed
for
nothing
at
all
you
can
take
that
from
me
my
child
he
spoke
with
such
delicate
persuasiveness
such
an
evident
desire
to
be
helpful
that
hilda
was
convinced
and
grew
resigned
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
he
had
made
a
tremendous
resolve
which
had
raised
him
above
the
edwin
she
knew
she
thought
she
had
hitherto
misjudged
and
underrated
him
i
wanted
to
explain
to
you
about
that
ten
pounds
she
said
that
s
all
right
that
s
all
right
said
he
hastily
but
i
tell
you
you
saw
cannon
s
letter
asking
me
for
money
well
i
borrowed
the
ten
pounds
from
janet
so
of
course
i
had
to
pay
it
back
hadn
t
i
how
is
janet
he
asked
in
a
new
lighter
tone
she
seems
to
be
going
on
splendidly
don
t
you
think
so
well
then
we
ll
go
home
shall
we
she
lifted
her
arms
and
he
bent
she
was
crying
in
a
moment
she
was
sobbing
she
gave
him
violent
kisses
amid
her
sobs
and
held
him
close
to
her
until
the
fit
passed
then
she
said
in
her
voice
reduced
to
that
of
a
child
what
time
s
the
train
chapter
xvi
the
ghost
i
it
was
the
autumn
dusk
had
already
begun
to
fade
and
in
the
damp
air
cold
grimy
and
vaporous
men
with
scarves
round
their
necks
and
girls
with
shawls
over
their
heads
or
hatted
and
even
gloved
were
going
home
from
work
past
the
petty
shops
where
sweets
tobacco
fried
fish
chitterlings
groceries
and
novelettes
were
sold
among
enamelled
advertisements
of
magic
soaps
in
the
feeble
and
patchy
illumination
of
the
footpaths
which
left
the
middle
of
the
streets
and
the
upper
air
all
obscure
the
chilled
preoccupied
people
passed
each
other
rapidly
like
phantoms
emerging
out
of
one
mystery
and
disappearing
into
another
everywhere
behind
the
fanlights
and
shaded
windows
of
cottages
domesticity
was
preparing
the
warm
relaxations
of
the
night
amid
the
streets
of
little
buildings
the
lithographic
establishment
with
a
yellow
oblong
here
and
there
illuminated
in
its
dark
façades
stood
up
high
larger
than
reality
more
important
and
tyrannic
one
of
the
barracks
one
of
the
prisons
one
of
the
where
a
single
man
or
a
small
group
of
men
by
brains
and
vigour
and
rigour
exploited
the
populace
edwin
sitting
late
in
his
private
office
behind
those
façades
was
not
unaware
of
the
sensation
of
being
an
exploiter
by
his
side
on
the
large
flat
desk
lay
a
copy
of
the
afternoon
s
containing
an
account
of
the
breaking
up
by
police
of
an
meeting
of
confessed
anarchists
on
the
previous
day
at
manchester
manchester
was
and
is
still
physically
and
morally
very
close
to
the
five
towns
which
respect
it
more
than
they
respect
london
an
anarchist
meeting
at
manchester
was
indeed
an
uncomfortable
portent
for
the
five
towns
enormous
strikes
like
civil
wars
at
stalemate
characterised
the
autumn
as
they
had
characterised
the
spring
affecting
directly
or
indirectly
every
industry
and
weakening
the
prestige
of
government
conventions
wealth
and
success
edwin
was
successful
it
was
because
he
was
successful
that
he
was
staying
late
and
that
a
clerk
in
the
outer
office
was
staying
late
and
that
windows
were
illuminated
here
and
there
in
the
façades
holding
in
his
hand
the
he
glanced
down
the
long
column
of
names
and
amounts
some
names
conveyed
nothing
to
him
but
most
of
them
raised
definite
images
in
his
mind
of
big
men
roughs
decent
clerks
with
wristbands
undersized
pale
machinists
intensely
respectable
skilled
artisans
and
daughtsmen
thin
ragged
lads
greasy
slatternly
pale
girls
and
one
or
two
fat
women
all
dirty
and
working
with
indifference
in
dirt
most
of
them
kowtowed
to
him
some
did
not
some
scowled
askance
but
they
were
all
dependent
on
him
not
one
of
them
but
would
be
prodigiously
alarmed
and
inconvenienced
to
say
nothing
of
going
hungry
if
it
he
did
not
pay
wages
the
next
morning
the
fact
was
he
could
distribute
ruin
with
a
gesture
and
nobody
could
bring
him
to
book
something
wrong
under
the
influence
of
strikes
and
anarchist
meetings
he
felt
with
foreboding
and
even
with
a
little
personal
alarm
that
something
was
wrong
those
greasy
slatternly
girls
for
instance
with
their
coarse
charm
and
their
sexuality
they
were
underpaid
they
received
as
much
as
other
girls
on
perhaps
more
but
they
were
underpaid
what
chance
had
they
he
was
getting
richer
every
day
and
safer
except
for
the
vague
menace
yet
he
could
not
appreciably
improve
their
lot
partly
for
business
reasons
partly
because
any
attempt
to
do
so
would
bring
the
community
about
his
ears
and
he
would
be
labelled
as
a
doctrinaire
and
a
fool
and
partly
because
his
own
commonsense
was
against
such
a
move
not
those
girls
not
his
works
not
this
industry
and
that
was
wrong
all
was
wrong
and
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
any
future
period
when
all
would
not
be
wrong
perfection
was
a
desolating
thought
nevertheless
the
struggle
towards
it
was
instinctive
and
had
to
go
on
the
danger
was
in
edwin
s
eyes
of
letting
that
particular
struggle
monopolise
one
s
energy
well
he
would
not
let
it
he
did
a
little
here
and
a
little
there
and
he
voted
democratically
and
in
his
heart
was
most
destructively
sarcastic
about
toryism
and
for
the
rest
he
relished
the
adventure
of
existence
and
took
the
best
he
conscientiously
could
and
thought
pretty
well
of
himself
as
a
lover
of
his
fellowmen
if
he
was
born
to
be
a
master
he
would
be
one
and
not
spend
his
days
in
trying
to
overthrow
mastery
he
was
tired
that
evening
he
had
a
slight
headache
he
certainly
had
worries
but
he
was
not
unhappy
on
the
throbbing
tossing
steamer
of
humanity
nobody
could
seem
less
adventurous
than
he
seemed
with
his
timidities
and
his
love
of
moderation
comfort
regularity
and
security
yet
his
nostrils
would
sniff
to
the
supreme
and
adventure
he
heard
hilda
s
clear
voice
in
the
outer
office
clayhanger
in
there
and
the
clerk
s
somewhat
nervously
agitated
reply
repeating
several
times
in
eager
affirmative
and
he
himself
the
master
though
still
all
alone
in
the
sanctum
at
once
pretended
to
be
very
busy
her
presence
would
thus
often
produce
an
excitation
in
the
organism
of
the
business
she
was
so
foreign
to
it
so
unsoiled
by
it
so
aloof
from
it
so
much
more
gracious
civilised
enigmatic
than
anything
that
the
business
could
show
and
fundamentally
she
was
the
cause
of
the
business
it
was
all
for
her
it
existed
with
its
dirt
noise
crudity
strain
and
eternal
effort
so
that
she
might
exist
in
her
elegance
her
disturbing
femininity
her
restricted
and
deep
affections
her
irrational
capriciousness
and
her
strange
brusque
commonsense
the
clerks
and
some
of
the
women
felt
this
big
james
certainly
felt
it
and
edwin
felt
it
and
denied
it
to
himself
more
than
anybody
there
was
no
economic
justice
in
the
arrangement
she
would
come
in
veiled
her
face
mysterious
behind
the
veil
and
after
a
few
minutes
she
would
delicately
lift
her
gloved
fingers
to
the
veil
and
raise
it
and
her
dark
pale
vivacious
face
would
be
disclosed
here
i
am
and
the
balance
was
even
her
debt
paid
that
was
how
it
was
in
the
month
that
had
passed
since
the
visit
to
dartmoor
edwin
despite
his
resolve
to
live
heroically
and
philosophically
had
sometimes
been
forced
into
the
secret
attitude
this
woman
will
kill
me
but
without
her
i
shouldn
t
be
interested
enough
to
live
he
was
sometimes
morally
above
her
to
the
point
of
priggishness
and
sometimes
incredibly
below
her
but
for
the
most
part
living
in
a
different
dimension
she
had
heard
nothing
further
from
cannon
she
knew
nothing
of
the
bigamist
s
fate
though
more
than
once
she
had
written
for
news
her
moods
were
unpredictable
and
disconcerting
and
as
her
moods
constituted
the
chief
object
of
edwin
s
study
the
effect
on
him
was
not
tranquillising
at
the
start
he
had
risen
to
the
difficulty
of
the
situation
but
he
could
not
permanently
remain
at
that
height
and
the
situation
had
apparently
become
stationary
his
exasperations
both
concealed
and
open
were
not
merely
unworthy
of
a
philosopher
they
were
unworthy
of
a
common
man
why
be
annoyed
he
would
say
to
himself
but
he
was
annoyed
the
tone
the
right
tone
he
would
remind
himself
surely
he
could
remember
to
command
his
voice
to
the
right
tone
but
no
he
could
not
he
could
infallibly
remember
to
wind
up
his
watch
but
he
could
not
remember
that
moreover
he
felt
as
he
had
felt
before
on
occasions
that
no
amount
of
right
tone
would
keep
their
relations
smooth
for
the
reason
that
principles
were
opposed
could
she
not
see
well
she
could
not
there
she
was
entire
unalterable
impossible
to
chip
inconvenient
pieces
off
her
you
must
take
her
or
leave
her
and
she
could
not
see
or
she
would
not
which
in
practice
was
the
same
thing
and
yet
some
of
the
most
exquisite
moments
of
their
union
had
occurred
during
that
feverish
and
unquiet
month
moments
of
absolute
surrender
and
devotion
on
her
part
of
protective
love
on
his
and
also
long
moments
of
peace
with
the
early
commencement
of
autumn
all
the
family
had
resumed
the
pursuit
of
letters
with
a
certain
ardour
a
startling
feminist
writer
and
the
writer
whose
parentage
and
whose
very
name
lay
in
the
five
towns
who
had
the
east
and
whose
vogue
was
a
passion
among
the
lettered
both
these
had
published
books
whose
success
was
extreme
and
genuine
and
in
the
curtained
of
a
night
hilda
would
sit
rejoicing
over
the
triumphant
satire
of
the
and
edwin
and
george
would
lounge
in
impossible
postures
each
mesmerised
by
a
story
of
the
and
between
chapters
edwin
might
rouse
himself
from
the
enchantment
sufficiently
to
reflect
how
indescribably
agreeable
these
evenings
are
and
ten
to
one
he
would
say
aloud
with
false
severity
george
bed
and
george
a
fine
judge
of
genuineness
in
severity
would
murmur
carelessly
all
right
i
m
going
and
not
go
and
now
edwin
in
the
office
thought
she
s
come
to
fetch
me
away
he
was
gratified
but
he
must
not
seem
to
be
gratified
the
sanctity
of
business
from
invasion
had
to
be
upheld
he
frowned
feigning
more
diligently
than
ever
to
be
occupied
she
came
in
with
that
air
at
once
apologetic
and
defiant
that
wives
have
in
affronting
the
sacred
fastness
nobody
could
have
guessed
that
she
had
ever
been
a
business
woman
arriving
regularly
at
just
such
an
office
every
morning
twisting
a
filing
making
appointments
nobody
could
have
guessed
that
she
had
ever
been
in
business
for
herself
and
had
known
how
sixpence
was
added
to
sixpence
and
a
week
s
profit
lost
in
an
hour
all
such
knowledge
had
apparently
dropped
from
her
like
an
excrescence
had
vanished
like
a
temporary
disfigurement
and
she
looked
upon
commerce
with
the
uncomprehending
careless
and
yet
impressed
eyes
of
a
young
girl
hello
missis
he
exclaimed
casually
then
george
came
in
since
the
visit
to
dartmoor
hilda
had
much
increased
her
intimacy
with
george
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
him
walking
with
him
and
exploring
in
a
sisterly
and
reassuring
manner
his
most
private
life
george
liked
it
but
it
occasionally
irked
him
and
he
would
give
a
hint
to
edwin
that
mother
needed
to
be
handled
at
times
you
needn
t
come
in
here
george
said
hilda
well
can
i
go
into
the
george
suggested
edwin
had
always
expected
that
he
would
prefer
the
but
the
was
his
haunt
probably
because
it
was
dirty
fiery
and
stuffy
no
you
can
t
said
edwin
pratt
s
gone
by
this
and
it
s
shut
up
no
it
isn
t
pratt
s
there
all
right
shut
the
door
dear
said
hilda
hooray
george
ran
off
and
banged
the
glass
door
hilda
glancing
by
habit
at
the
unsightly
details
of
the
deteriorating
room
walked
round
the
desk
with
apprehension
edwin
saw
resolve
and
perturbation
in
her
face
he
was
about
to
say
look
here
infant
i
m
supposed
to
be
busy
but
he
refrained
holding
out
a
letter
which
she
nervously
snatched
from
her
bag
hilda
said
i
ve
just
had
this
by
the
afternoon
post
read
it
he
recognised
at
once
the
sloping
handwriting
but
the
paper
was
different
it
was
a
mere
torn
of
very
cheap
notepaper
he
read
dear
clayhanger
just
a
line
to
say
that
my
husband
is
at
last
discharged
it
has
been
weary
waiting
we
are
together
and
i
am
looking
after
him
with
renewed
thanks
for
your
sympathy
and
help
believe
me
sincerely
yours
charlotte
m
cannon
the
signature
was
scarcely
legible
there
was
no
address
no
date
edwin
s
first
flitting
despicable
masculine
thought
was
she
doesn
t
say
anything
about
that
ten
pounds
it
fled
he
was
happy
in
an
intense
relief
that
affected
all
his
being
he
said
to
himself
now
that
s
over
we
can
begin
again
well
he
murmured
that
s
all
right
didn
t
i
always
tell
you
it
would
take
some
time
that
s
all
right
he
gazed
at
the
paper
waving
it
in
his
hand
as
he
held
it
by
one
corner
he
perceived
that
it
was
the
letter
of
a
jealous
woman
who
had
got
what
she
wanted
and
meant
to
hold
it
and
entirely
to
herself
and
his
mood
became
somewhat
sardonic
very
curt
isn
t
it
said
hilda
strangely
and
after
all
this
time
too
he
looked
up
at
her
turning
his
head
sideways
to
catch
her
eyes
that
letter
he
said
in
a
voice
as
strange
as
hilda
s
that
letter
is
exactly
what
it
ought
to
be
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
better
turned
you
don
t
want
to
keep
it
i
suppose
do
you
no
she
muttered
he
tore
it
into
very
small
pieces
and
dropped
them
into
the
beneath
the
desk
and
burn
all
the
others
he
said
in
a
low
tone
edwin
after
a
pause
yes
don
t
you
think
george
ought
to
know
don
t
you
think
one
of
us
ought
to
tell
him
either
you
or
me
you
might
tell
him
tell
him
what
edwin
demanded
sharply
pushing
back
his
chair
well
everything
he
glowered
he
could
feel
himself
glowering
he
could
feel
the
justifiable
anger
animating
him
certainly
not
he
enunciated
resentfully
masterfully
overpoweringly
certainly
not
but
supposing
he
hears
from
outsiders
you
needn
t
begin
supposing
but
he
s
bound
to
have
to
know
sometime
possibly
but
he
isn
t
going
to
know
now
any
road
not
with
my
consent
the
thing
s
absolute
madness
hilda
almost
whispered
very
well
dear
if
you
think
so
i
do
think
so
he
suddenly
felt
very
sorry
for
her
he
was
ready
to
excuse
her
astounding
morbidity
as
a
consequence
of
extreme
spiritual
tribulation
he
added
with
brusque
and
so
will
you
in
the
morning
my
child
shall
you
be
long
no
i
told
you
i
should
be
late
if
you
ll
run
off
my
chuck
i
ll
undertake
to
be
after
you
in
half
an
hour
is
your
headache
better
no
on
the
other
hand
it
isn
t
worse
he
gazed
fiercely
at
the
she
bent
down
kiss
me
she
murmured
tearfully
as
he
kissed
her
and
as
she
pressed
against
him
he
absorbed
and
understood
all
the
emotions
through
which
she
had
passed
and
was
passing
and
from
him
to
her
was
transmitted
an
unimaginable
tenderness
that
shamed
and
atoned
for
the
inclemency
of
his
refusals
he
was
very
happy
he
knew
that
he
would
not
do
another
stroke
of
work
that
night
but
still
he
must
pretend
to
do
some
playfully
without
rising
he
drew
down
her
veil
smacked
her
gently
on
the
back
and
indicated
the
door
i
have
to
call
at
clara
s
about
that
wool
for
maggie
she
said
with
courage
his
fingering
of
her
veil
had
given
her
extreme
pleasure
i
ll
bring
the
kid
up
he
said
will
you
she
departed
leaving
the
door
unlatched
ii
a
draught
from
the
outer
door
swung
the
unlatched
door
of
edwin
s
room
what
are
doors
for
he
muttered
pleasantly
impatient
then
he
called
aloud
simpson
shut
the
outer
door
and
this
one
too
there
was
no
answer
he
arose
and
went
to
the
outer
office
hilda
had
passed
through
it
like
an
arrow
simpson
was
not
there
but
a
man
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
he
held
at
full
spread
a
copy
of
the
which
concealed
all
the
upper
part
of
him
except
his
fingers
and
the
crown
of
his
head
though
the
gas
had
been
lighted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
must
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
read
by
it
since
it
shone
through
the
paper
he
lowered
the
newspaper
with
a
rustle
and
looked
at
edwin
he
was
a
big
man
wearing
a
dark
grey
suit
a
blue
melton
overcoat
and
a
quite
new
glossy
felt
hat
he
had
a
straight
prominent
nose
and
dark
restless
eyes
set
back
his
short
hair
was
getting
grey
but
not
his
short
black
moustache
were
you
waiting
to
see
me
edwin
said
in
a
defensive
tone
the
man
might
be
a
belated
commercial
traveller
of
a
big
house
some
of
those
fellows
considered
themselves
above
all
laws
on
the
other
hand
he
might
be
a
new
customer
in
a
hurry
yes
was
the
reply
in
a
deep
full
and
yet
uncertain
voice
the
clerk
said
you
couldn
t
be
disturbed
and
asked
me
to
wait
then
he
went
out
what
can
i
do
for
you
it
s
really
after
hours
but
some
of
us
are
working
a
bit
late
the
man
glanced
at
the
outer
door
which
edwin
was
shutting
and
then
at
the
inner
door
which
exposed
edwin
s
room
i
m
george
cannon
he
said
advancing
a
step
as
it
were
defiantly
for
an
instant
edwin
was
frightened
by
the
sudden
melodrama
of
the
situation
then
he
thought
i
am
up
against
this
man
this
is
a
crisis
and
he
became
almost
agreeably
aware
of
his
own
being
the
man
stood
close
to
him
under
the
gas
with
all
the
enigmatic
quality
of
another
being
he
could
perceive
now
at
any
rate
he
could
believe
that
it
was
george
cannon
forgetful
of
what
the
man
had
suffered
edwin
felt
for
him
nothing
but
the
instinctive
inimical
distrust
of
the
individual
who
has
never
got
at
loggerheads
with
society
for
the
individual
who
once
and
for
always
has
to
this
feeling
was
added
a
powerful
resentment
of
the
man
s
act
in
coming
especially
unannounced
to
just
the
husband
of
the
woman
he
had
dishonoured
it
was
a
monstrous
act
and
doubtless
an
act
characteristic
of
the
man
it
was
what
might
have
been
expected
the
man
might
have
been
innocent
of
a
particular
crime
might
have
been
falsely
imprisoned
but
what
had
he
originally
been
doing
with
what
rascals
had
he
been
consorting
that
he
should
be
even
suspected
of
crime
george
cannon
s
astonishing
presence
so
suddenly
after
his
release
at
the
works
of
edwin
clayhanger
was
unforgiveable
edwin
felt
an
impulse
to
say
savagely
look
here
you
clear
out
you
understand
english
don
t
you
hook
it
but
he
had
not
the
brutality
to
say
it
moreover
the
clerk
returned
carrying
full
to
the
brim
the
tin
used
for
wetting
the
of
the
will
you
come
in
please
said
edwin
curtly
simpson
i
m
engaged
the
two
men
went
into
the
inner
room
sit
down
said
edwin
grimly
george
cannon
with
a
firm
gesture
planted
his
hat
on
the
flat
desk
between
them
he
looked
round
behind
him
at
the
shut
glazed
door
you
needn
t
be
afraid
said
edwin
nobody
can
hear
unless
you
shout
he
gazed
curiously
but
somewhat
surreptitiously
at
george
cannon
trying
to
decide
whether
it
was
possible
to
see
in
him
a
released
convict
he
decided
that
it
was
not
possible
george
cannon
had
a
shifty
but
not
a
beaten
look
many
men
had
a
shifty
look
his
hair
was
somewhat
short
but
so
was
the
hair
of
many
men
if
not
of
most
he
was
apparently
in
fair
health
assuredly
his
constitution
had
not
been
ruined
and
if
his
large
coarse
features
were
worn
marked
with
tiny
black
spots
and
seamed
and
generally
ravaged
they
were
not
more
ravaged
than
the
features
of
numerous
citizens
of
bursley
aged
about
fifty
who
saved
money
earned
honours
and
incurred
the
envy
of
presumably
intelligent
persons
and
as
he
realised
all
this
edwin
s
retrospective
painful
alarm
as
to
what
might
have
happened
if
hilda
had
noticed
george
cannon
in
the
outer
office
lessened
until
he
could
dismiss
it
entirely
by
chance
she
had
ignored
cannon
perhaps
scarcely
seeing
him
in
her
preoccupied
passage
perhaps
taking
him
vaguely
for
a
customer
but
supposing
she
recognised
him
what
then
there
would
have
been
an
awkward
scene
nothing
more
awkward
scenes
do
not
kill
their
effect
is
transient
hilda
would
have
had
to
behave
and
would
have
behaved
with
severe
commonsense
he
edwin
himself
would
have
handled
the
affair
a
demeanour
and
impassible
was
what
was
needed
after
all
a
man
recently
out
of
prison
was
not
a
wild
beast
nor
yet
a
freak
hundreds
of
men
were
coming
out
of
prisons
every
day
he
should
know
how
to
deal
with
this
man
not
pharisaically
not
cruelly
not
unkindly
but
still
with
a
clear
indication
to
the
man
of
his
reprehensible
indiscretion
in
being
where
he
then
was
did
she
recognise
me
down
there
dartmoor
asked
george
cannon
without
any
preparing
of
the
ground
in
a
deep
trembling
voice
and
as
he
spoke
a
flush
spread
slowly
over
his
dark
features
er
yes
answered
edwin
and
his
voice
also
trembled
i
wasn
t
sure
said
george
cannon
we
were
halted
before
i
could
see
and
i
daren
t
look
round
i
should
ha
been
punished
i
ve
been
punished
before
now
for
looking
up
at
the
sky
at
exercise
he
spoke
more
quickly
and
then
brought
himself
up
with
a
snort
however
i
ve
not
come
all
the
way
here
to
talk
prison
so
you
needn
t
be
afraid
i
m
not
one
of
your
reformers
in
his
weak
but
ungoverned
nervous
excitement
from
which
a
faint
trace
of
hysteria
was
not
absent
he
now
seemed
rather
more
like
an
despite
his
good
clothes
he
had
become
to
edwin
s
superior
suddenly
wistful
and
at
the
same
time
the
strange
opening
question
and
its
accent
had
stirred
edwin
and
he
saw
with
remorse
how
much
finer
had
been
hilda
s
morbid
and
violent
pity
than
his
own
harsh
commonsense
and
anxiety
to
avoid
emotion
the
man
in
good
clothes
moved
him
more
than
the
convict
had
moved
him
he
seemed
to
have
received
vision
and
he
saw
not
merely
the
unbearable
pathos
of
george
cannon
but
the
high
and
heavenly
charitableness
of
hilda
which
he
had
constantly
douched
and
his
own
common
earthliness
he
was
exceedingly
humbled
and
he
also
thought
sadly
this
chap
s
still
attached
to
her
poor
devil
what
have
you
come
for
he
enquired
george
cannon
cleared
his
throat
edwin
waited
in
fear
for
the
avowal
he
could
make
nothing
out
of
the
visitor
s
face
its
expression
was
anxious
and
drew
sympathy
but
there
was
something
in
it
which
chilled
the
sympathy
it
invoked
and
which
seemed
to
say
i
shall
look
after
myself
it
yielded
naught
you
could
be
sorry
for
the
heart
within
and
yet
could
neither
like
nor
esteem
it
punished
for
looking
up
at
the
sky
glimpses
of
prison
life
presented
themselves
to
edwin
s
imagination
he
saw
george
cannon
again
halted
and
turning
like
a
serf
to
the
wall
of
the
corridor
and
this
man
opposite
to
him
close
to
him
in
the
familiar
room
was
the
same
man
as
the
serf
was
he
the
same
man
inscrutable
the
enigma
of
that
existence
whose
breathing
was
faintly
audible
across
the
desk
you
know
all
about
it
about
my
affair
of
course
well
said
edwin
i
expect
you
know
how
much
i
know
i
m
an
honest
man
you
know
that
i
needn
t
begin
by
explaining
that
to
you
edwin
nerved
himself
you
weren
t
honest
towards
hilda
if
it
comes
to
that
he
used
his
wife
s
christian
name
to
this
man
with
whom
he
had
never
before
spoken
naturally
inevitably
he
would
not
say
my
wife
to
have
said
my
wife
would
somehow
have
brought
some
muddiness
upon
that
wife
and
by
contact
upon
her
husband
when
i
say
honest
i
mean
you
know
what
i
mean
about
hilda
i
don
t
defend
that
only
i
couldn
t
help
myself
i
daresay
i
should
do
it
again
edwin
could
feel
his
eyes
smarting
and
he
blinked
and
yet
he
was
angry
with
the
man
who
went
on
it
s
no
use
talking
about
that
that
s
over
and
i
couldn
t
help
it
i
had
to
do
it
she
s
come
out
of
it
all
right
she
s
not
harmed
and
i
thank
god
for
it
if
there
d
been
a
child
living
well
it
would
ha
been
different
edwin
started
this
man
didn
t
know
he
was
a
father
and
his
son
was
within
a
few
yards
of
him
might
come
running
in
at
any
moment
no
young
george
would
not
come
in
nothing
but
positive
orders
would
get
the
boy
out
of
the
so
long
as
the
remained
there
was
it
possible
that
hilda
had
concealed
the
existence
of
her
child
or
had
announced
the
child
s
death
if
so
she
had
never
done
a
wiser
thing
and
such
sagacity
struck
him
as
heroic
but
if
cannon
knew
as
to
the
child
then
it
was
cannon
who
with
equal
prudence
and
for
a
different
end
had
concealed
its
existence
from
george
cannon
or
lied
to
him
as
to
its
death
certainly
the
man
was
sincere
as
he
said
thank
god
his
full
voice
had
vibrated
like
the
voice
of
an
ardent
religionist
at
a
george
cannon
began
again
all
i
mean
is
i
m
an
honest
man
i
ve
been
damnably
treated
not
that
i
want
to
go
into
that
no
i
m
a
fatalist
that
s
over
that
s
done
with
i
m
not
whining
all
i
m
insisting
on
is
that
i
m
not
a
thief
and
i
m
not
a
forger
and
i
ve
nothing
to
hide
perhaps
i
brought
my
difficulties
about
that
business
on
myself
but
when
you
ve
once
been
in
prison
you
don
t
choose
your
friends
you
can
t
perhaps
i
might
have
ended
by
being
a
thief
or
a
forger
only
on
this
occasion
it
just
happens
that
i
ve
had
a
good
six
years
for
being
innocent
i
never
did
anything
wrong
or
even
silly
except
let
myself
get
too
fond
of
somebody
that
might
happen
to
anyone
it
did
happen
to
me
but
there
s
nothing
else
you
understand
i
never
yes
yes
certainly
said
edwin
stopping
him
as
he
was
about
to
repeat
all
the
argument
afresh
it
was
a
convincing
argument
no
one
s
got
the
right
to
look
down
on
me
i
mean
george
cannon
insisted
bringing
his
face
forward
over
the
desk
on
the
contrary
this
country
owes
me
an
apology
however
i
don
t
want
to
go
into
that
that
s
done
with
spilt
milk
s
spilt
i
know
what
the
world
is
i
agree
i
agree
said
edwin
he
did
the
honesty
of
his
intelligence
admitted
almost
too
eagerly
and
completely
the
force
of
the
pleading
well
said
george
cannon
to
cut
it
short
i
want
help
and
i
ve
come
to
you
for
it
me
edwin
feebly
exclaimed
you
clayhanger
i
ve
come
straight
here
from
london
i
haven
t
a
friend
in
the
whole
world
not
one
it
s
not
everybody
can
say
that
there
was
a
fellow
named
dayson
at
turnhill
used
to
work
for
me
he
d
have
done
something
if
he
could
but
he
was
too
big
a
fool
to
be
able
to
and
besides
he
s
gone
no
address
i
wrote
to
him
oh
that
chap
murmured
edwin
trying
to
find
relief
in
even
a
momentary
turn
of
the
conversation
i
know
who
you
mean
he
died
in
the
isle
of
man
on
his
holiday
two
years
ago
it
was
in
the
papers
his
address
is
it
good
old
dead
letter
office
well
he
is
crossed
off
the
list
then
no
mistake
cannon
snarled
bitterly
i
m
aware
you
re
not
a
friend
of
mine
i
ve
no
claim
on
you
you
don
t
know
me
but
you
know
about
me
when
i
saw
you
in
dartmoor
i
guessed
who
you
were
and
i
said
to
myself
you
looked
the
sort
of
man
who
might
help
another
man
why
did
you
come
into
the
prison
why
did
you
bring
her
there
you
must
have
known
i
was
there
he
spoke
with
a
sudden
change
to
reproachfulness
i
didn
t
bring
her
there
edwin
blushed
it
was
however
we
needn
t
go
into
that
if
you
don
t
mind
was
she
upset
of
course
cannon
sighed
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
edwin
gloomily
in
secret
he
was
rather
pleased
that
george
cannon
should
have
deemed
him
of
the
sort
likely
to
help
was
it
the
flattery
of
a
mendicant
no
he
did
not
think
it
was
he
believed
implicitly
everything
the
man
was
saying
money
said
cannon
sharply
money
you
won
t
feel
it
but
it
will
save
me
after
all
clayhanger
there
s
a
bond
between
us
if
it
comes
to
that
there
s
a
bond
between
us
and
you
ve
had
all
the
luck
of
it
again
edwin
blushed
but
surely
your
wife
he
stammered
surely
cannon
isn
t
without
funds
of
course
i
know
she
was
temporarily
rather
short
a
while
back
but
surely
how
do
you
know
she
was
short
cannon
grimly
interrupted
my
wife
sent
her
ten
pounds
i
fancy
it
was
ten
pounds
towards
expenses
you
know
cannon
ejaculated
half
to
himself
savagely
never
told
me
he
remained
silent
but
i
ve
always
understood
she
s
a
woman
of
property
edwin
finished
cannon
put
both
elbows
on
the
desk
leaned
further
forward
and
opened
his
mouth
several
seconds
before
speaking
clayhanger
i
ve
left
my
wife
as
you
call
her
if
i
d
stayed
with
her
i
should
have
killed
her
i
ve
run
off
yes
i
know
all
she
s
done
for
me
i
know
without
her
i
might
have
been
in
prison
and
for
a
couple
o
years
to
come
but
i
d
sooner
be
in
prison
or
in
hell
or
anywhere
you
like
than
with
cannon
she
s
an
old
woman
she
always
was
an
old
woman
she
was
nearly
forty
when
she
hooked
me
and
i
was
and
i
m
young
yet
i
m
not
yet
she
s
got
a
clear
conscience
cannon
has
she
always
does
her
duty
she
d
let
me
walk
over
her
she
d
never
complain
if
only
she
could
keep
me
she
d
just
play
and
smile
oh
yes
she
d
turn
the
other
cheek
and
keep
on
turning
it
but
she
isn
t
going
to
have
me
and
for
all
she
s
done
i
m
not
grateful
hag
that
s
what
she
is
he
spoke
loudly
excitedly
under
considerable
emotion
hsh
edwin
alarmed
endeavoured
gently
to
soothe
him
all
right
all
right
cannon
proceeded
in
a
lower
but
still
impassioned
voice
but
look
here
you
re
a
man
you
know
what
s
what
you
ll
understand
what
i
mean
believe
me
when
i
say
that
i
wouldn
t
live
with
that
woman
for
eternal
salvation
i
couldn
t
i
couldn
t
do
it
i
ve
taken
some
of
her
money
only
a
little
and
run
off
he
paused
and
went
on
with
conscious
persuasiveness
now
i
ve
just
got
here
i
had
to
ask
your
whereabouts
i
might
have
been
recognised
in
the
streets
but
i
haven
t
been
i
didn
t
expect
to
find
you
here
at
this
time
i
might
have
had
to
sleep
in
the
town
i
wouldn
t
have
come
to
your
private
house
now
i
ve
seen
you
i
shall
get
along
to
crewe
i
shall
be
safer
there
and
it
s
on
the
way
to
liverpool
and
america
i
want
to
go
to
america
with
a
bit
o
capital
i
shall
be
all
right
in
america
it
s
my
one
chance
but
it
s
a
good
one
but
i
must
have
some
capital
no
use
landing
in
new
york
with
empty
pockets
said
edwin
still
shying
at
the
main
issues
i
was
under
the
impression
you
had
been
to
america
once
yes
that
s
why
i
know
i
hadn
t
any
money
and
what
s
more
he
added
with
peculiar
emphasis
i
was
brought
back
edwin
thought
i
shall
yield
to
this
man
at
that
instant
he
saw
the
shadow
of
hilda
s
head
and
shoulders
on
the
glass
of
the
door
excuse
me
a
second
he
murmured
bounded
with
astonishing
velocity
out
of
the
room
and
pulled
the
door
to
after
him
with
a
bang
iii
hilda
having
observed
the
strange
excited
gesture
paused
a
moment
in
an
equally
strange
tranquillity
before
speaking
edwin
fronted
her
at
the
very
door
then
she
said
clearly
and
deliberately
through
her
veil
auntie
hamps
has
had
an
attack
heart
the
doctor
says
she
can
t
possibly
live
through
the
night
it
was
at
clara
s
this
was
the
first
of
hamps
s
fatal
ah
breathed
edwin
with
apparently
a
purely
artistic
interest
in
the
affair
so
that
s
it
is
it
then
she
s
at
clara
s
yes
what
doctor
i
forget
his
name
lives
in
acre
lane
they
sent
for
the
nearest
she
can
t
get
her
breath
has
to
fight
for
it
she
jumped
out
of
bed
struggling
to
breathe
have
you
seen
her
yes
they
made
me
albert
there
oh
yes
well
i
suppose
i
d
better
go
round
you
go
back
i
ll
follow
you
he
was
conscious
of
not
the
slightest
feeling
of
sorrow
at
the
imminent
death
of
auntie
hamps
even
the
image
of
the
old
lady
fighting
to
fetch
her
breath
scarcely
moved
him
though
the
deathbed
of
his
father
had
been
harrowing
enough
he
and
hilda
had
the
same
thought
at
last
something
has
happened
to
auntie
hamps
and
it
gave
zest
i
must
speak
to
you
said
hilda
low
and
moved
towards
the
inner
door
the
clerk
simpson
was
behind
them
at
his
desk
stamping
letters
and
politely
pretending
to
be
deaf
no
edwin
stopped
her
there
s
someone
in
there
we
can
t
talk
there
a
customer
yes
i
say
simpson
have
you
done
those
letters
yes
sir
answered
simpson
smiling
he
had
been
recommended
as
a
very
superior
youth
and
had
not
disappointed
despite
a
constitutional
nervousness
take
them
to
the
pillar
and
call
at
benbow
s
and
tell
them
that
i
ll
be
round
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
don
t
know
as
you
need
come
back
hurry
up
yes
sir
edwin
and
hilda
watched
simpson
go
whatever
s
the
matter
hilda
demanded
in
a
low
harsh
voice
as
soon
as
the
outer
door
had
clicked
it
was
as
if
something
sinister
in
her
had
been
suddenly
released
matter
nothing
why
you
look
so
queer
well
you
come
along
with
these
shocks
he
gave
a
short
awkward
laugh
he
felt
and
looked
guilty
and
he
knew
that
he
looked
guilty
you
looked
queer
when
you
came
out
you
ve
upset
yourself
my
child
that
s
all
he
now
realised
the
high
degree
of
excitement
which
he
himself
without
previously
being
aware
of
it
had
reached
edwin
who
is
it
in
there
don
t
i
tell
you
it
s
a
customer
he
could
see
her
nostrils
twitching
through
the
veil
it
s
george
cannon
in
there
she
exclaimed
he
laughed
again
what
makes
you
feel
that
he
asked
feeling
all
the
while
the
complete
absurdity
of
such
fencing
when
i
ran
out
i
noticed
somebody
he
was
reading
a
newspaper
and
i
couldn
t
see
him
but
he
just
moved
it
a
bit
and
i
seemed
to
catch
sight
of
the
top
of
his
head
and
when
i
got
into
the
street
i
said
to
myself
it
looked
like
george
cannon
and
then
i
said
of
course
it
couldn
t
and
then
with
this
business
about
auntie
hamps
the
idea
went
right
out
of
my
head
well
it
is
if
you
want
to
know
her
mysterious
body
and
face
seemed
to
radiate
a
disastrous
emotion
that
filled
the
whole
office
did
you
know
he
was
coming
i
did
not
hadn
t
the
least
notion
the
sensation
of
criminality
began
to
leave
edwin
as
hilda
seemed
to
move
and
waver
he
added
now
you
aren
t
going
to
see
him
and
his
voice
menacingly
challenged
her
and
defied
her
to
stir
a
step
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
then
was
that
hilda
should
not
see
george
cannon
he
would
stop
her
by
force
he
would
let
himself
get
angry
and
brutal
he
would
show
her
that
he
was
the
stronger
he
had
quite
abandoned
his
earlier
attitude
of
unsentimental
callousness
which
argued
that
after
all
it
wouldn
t
ultimately
matter
whether
they
encountered
each
other
or
not
far
from
that
he
was
so
it
appeared
to
him
standing
between
them
desperate
and
determined
and
acting
instinctively
and
conventionally
their
separate
pasts
each
full
of
grief
and
tragedy
converged
terribly
upon
him
in
an
effort
to
meet
in
just
that
moment
and
he
was
ferociously
resisting
what
does
he
want
he
wants
me
to
help
him
to
go
to
america
he
says
he
hasn
t
a
friend
but
what
about
his
wife
that
s
just
what
i
said
he
s
left
her
says
he
can
t
live
with
her
there
was
a
silence
in
which
the
tension
appreciably
lessened
can
t
live
with
her
well
i
m
not
surprised
but
i
do
think
it
s
strange
him
coming
to
you
so
do
i
said
edwin
drily
taking
the
upper
hand
for
the
change
in
hilda
s
tone
her
almost
childlike
satisfaction
in
the
news
that
cannon
would
not
live
with
his
wife
seemed
to
endow
him
with
superiority
but
there
s
a
lot
of
strange
things
in
this
world
now
listen
here
i
m
not
going
to
keep
him
waiting
i
can
t
he
then
spoke
very
gravely
authoritatively
and
ominously
find
george
and
take
him
home
at
once
hilda
impressed
gave
a
frown
i
think
it
s
very
wrong
that
you
should
be
asked
to
help
him
her
voice
shook
and
nearly
broke
shall
you
help
him
edwin
i
shall
get
him
out
of
this
town
at
once
and
out
of
the
country
do
as
i
say
as
things
are
he
doesn
t
know
there
is
any
george
and
it
s
just
as
well
he
shouldn
t
but
if
he
stays
anywhere
about
he
s
bound
to
know
all
hilda
s
demeanour
admitted
that
george
cannon
had
never
been
allowed
to
know
that
he
had
a
son
and
the
simple
candour
of
the
admission
frightened
edwin
by
its
very
simplicity
now
off
you
go
george
is
in
the
hilda
moved
reluctantly
towards
the
like
a
reproved
and
rebellious
schoolgirl
suddenly
she
burst
into
tears
sprang
at
edwin
and
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
him
through
the
veil
nobody
but
you
would
have
helped
him
in
your
place
she
murmured
passionately
half
admiring
half
protesting
and
with
a
backward
look
as
she
hurried
off
her
face
stern
and
yet
soft
seemed
to
appeal
help
him
edwin
was
at
once
deeply
happy
and
impregnated
with
a
sense
of
the
frightful
sadness
that
lurks
in
the
hollows
of
the
world
he
stood
alone
with
the
flaring
gas
overcome
iv
he
went
back
to
the
private
room
and
rather
with
a
clear
feeling
of
relief
that
hilda
was
disposed
of
removed
from
the
equation
and
not
unsuccessfully
after
the
woman
to
deal
with
the
man
in
the
plain
language
of
men
seemed
simple
and
easy
he
was
astounded
equally
by
the
grudging
tardiness
of
cannon
s
information
to
hilda
as
to
the
release
and
by
the
baffling
inflexible
detraction
of
hilda
s
words
well
i
m
not
surprised
and
the
flitting
image
of
auntie
hamps
fighting
for
life
still
left
him
untouched
he
looked
at
george
cannon
and
george
cannon
with
his
unreliable
eyes
looked
at
him
he
almost
expected
cannon
to
say
was
that
hilda
you
were
talking
to
out
there
but
cannon
seemed
to
have
no
suspicion
that
in
either
the
inner
or
the
outer
room
he
had
been
so
close
to
her
no
doubt
when
he
was
waiting
by
the
in
the
outer
room
he
had
lifted
the
paper
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
door
unlatched
expressly
in
order
to
screen
himself
from
observation
probably
he
had
not
even
guessed
that
the
passer
was
a
woman
had
simpson
been
there
the
polite
young
man
would
doubtless
have
said
good
night
clayhanger
but
simpson
had
happened
not
to
be
there
are
you
going
to
help
me
asked
george
cannon
after
a
moment
and
his
heavy
voice
was
so
beseeching
so
humble
so
surprisingly
sycophantic
so
fearful
that
edwin
could
scarcely
bear
to
hear
it
he
hated
to
hear
that
one
man
could
be
so
slavishly
dependent
on
another
indeed
he
much
preferred
cannon
s
defiant
tone
yes
said
he
i
shall
do
what
i
can
what
do
you
want
a
hundred
pounds
said
george
cannon
and
as
he
named
the
sum
his
glance
was
hard
and
steady
edwin
was
startled
but
immediately
he
began
to
readjust
his
ideas
persuading
himself
that
after
all
the
man
could
not
prudently
have
asked
for
less
i
can
t
give
it
you
all
now
cannon
s
face
lighted
up
in
relief
and
joy
his
black
eyes
sparkled
feverishly
with
the
impatience
of
an
almost
hopeless
desire
about
to
be
satisfied
although
he
did
not
move
his
had
for
the
moment
gone
completely
and
the
secrets
of
his
soul
were
exposed
can
you
send
it
me
in
notes
i
can
give
you
an
address
in
liverpool
his
voice
could
hardly
utter
the
words
wait
a
second
said
edwin
he
went
to
the
safe
let
into
the
wall
of
which
he
was
still
so
naïvely
proud
and
unlocked
it
with
the
owner
s
gesture
the
perfect
fitting
of
the
bright
key
the
ease
with
which
it
turned
the
silent
heavy
swing
of
the
massive
door
on
its
hinges
these
things
gave
him
physical
as
well
as
moral
pleasure
he
savoured
the
security
of
his
position
and
his
ability
to
rescue
people
from
destruction
from
the
cavern
of
the
safe
he
took
out
a
bag
of
gold
part
of
the
money
required
for
wages
on
the
morrow
he
would
have
to
send
to
the
bank
again
in
the
morning
he
knew
that
the
bag
contained
exactly
twenty
pounds
in
but
he
shed
the
lovely
twinkling
coins
on
the
desk
and
counted
them
here
he
said
here
s
twenty
pounds
take
the
bag
too
it
ll
be
handier
and
he
put
the
money
into
the
bag
then
a
foolish
grand
idea
struck
him
write
down
the
address
on
this
envelope
will
you
and
i
ll
send
you
a
hundred
you
can
rely
on
it
eighty
you
mean
muttered
george
cannon
no
said
edwin
with
affected
nonchalance
blushing
a
hundred
the
twenty
will
get
you
over
and
you
ll
have
a
hundred
clear
when
you
arrive
on
the
other
side
ye
re
very
kind
said
cannon
weakly
i
here
here
s
the
envelope
here
s
a
bit
of
pencil
edwin
stopped
him
hastily
his
fear
of
being
thanked
made
him
harsh
while
cannon
was
nervously
writing
the
address
he
noticed
that
the
man
s
clumsy
fingers
were
those
of
a
you
ll
get
it
all
back
you
ll
see
said
cannon
as
he
stood
up
to
leave
holding
his
glossy
felt

edwin
smiled
deprecating
the

good

he
said
you

all
right
there
s
a
train
at
shawport
at
eight
seven
they
shook
hands
and
quitted
the
inner
office
as
he
traversed
the
outer
office
on
his
way
forth
in
front
of
edwin
cannon
turned
his
head
as
if
to
say
something
but
confused
he
said
nothing
and
went
on
and
at
once
he
disappeared
into
the
darkness
outside
and
edwin
was
left
with
a
memory
of
his
dubious
eyes
hard
rather
than
confident
profoundly
relieved
rather
than
profoundly
grateful

edwin
murmured
by
himself
who
d
have
thought
it
they
say
those
chaps
always
turn
up
again
like
bad
pennies
but
i
bet
he
won
t
simultaneously
he
reflected
upon
the
case
of
cannon
deserted
but
it
did
not
excite
his
pity
he
fastened
the
safe
extinguished
the
lights
shut
the
office
and
prepared
his
mind
for
the
visit
to
auntie
hamps
v
hilda
and
her
son
were
in
the
in
which
the
table
set
for
a
special
meal
made
a
glittering
oblong
of
white
on
the
table
among
plates
and
knives
and
forks
lay
some
of
george
s
shabby
in
most
branches
of
knowledge
george
privately
knew
that
he
could
instruct
his
parents
especially
his
mother
nevertheless
that
beloved
outgrown
creature
was
still
occasionally
useful
at
as
for
instance
in
poetry
george
disdainful
had
to
learn
some
verses
each
week
and
now
his
mother
held
a
book
entitled
the
poetry
reciter
while
george
mumbled
with
imperfect
verbal
accuracy
the
apparently
immortal
lines
abou
ben
adhem
may
his
tribe
increase
awoke
one
night
from
a
deep
dream
of
peace
his
mother
however
scarcely
regarded
the
book
she
knew
the
poem
by
heart
and
had
indeed
recited
it
to
george
who
though
he
was
much
impressed
by
her
fire
could
not
by
any
means
have
been
persuaded
to
imitate
the
freedom
of
her
delivery
his
elocution
was
unusually
bad
for
the
reason
that
he
had
been
pleasurably
excited
by
the
immense
news
of
auntie
hamps
s
illness
not
that
he
had
any
grudge
against
auntie
hamps
his
pleasure
would
have
been
as
keen
in
the
grave
illness
of
any
other
important
family
connection
save
his
mother
and
edwin
such
notable
events
gave
a
sensational
interest
to
domestic
life
which
domestic
life
as
a
rule
lacked
then
through
the
door
of
the
came
the
sound
of
edwin
s
in
the
there
s
uncle
exclaimed
george
and
jumped
up
hilda
stopped
him
put
your
books
together
said
she
you
know
uncle
likes
to
go
up
to
the
bathroom
before
he
does
anything
it
was
a
fact
that
the
precisian
hated
even
to
be
greeted
on
his
return
home
in
the
evening
until
he
came
downstairs
from
the
bathroom
hilda
herself
collected
the
books
and
put
them
on
the
sideboard
shall
i
tell
ada
george
suggested
champing
the
bit
no
ada
knows
with
deliberation
hilda
tended
the
fire
her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
emotional
flux
memories
and
comparisons
mournfully
and
yet
agreeably
animated
it
she
thought
of
the
days
when
she
used
to
recite
amid
enthusiasm
in
the
old
of
the
orgreaves
and
of
the
days
when
she
was
a
wanderer
had
no
home
no
support
little
security
and
of
the
brief
uncertain
days
with
george
cannon
and
of
the
eternal
days
when
her
only
assurance
was
the
assurance
of
disaster
she
glanced
at
george
and
saw
in
him
reminders
of
his
tragic
secret
father
now
hidden
away
forced
into
the
background
like
something
obscene
nearly
every
development
of
the
present
out
of
the
past
seemed
to
her
now
to
be
tragic
johnnie
orgreave
had
of
course
not
come
back
from
his
idyll
with
the
ripping
chris
hamson
their
seclusion
was
not
positively
known
but
the
whole
district
knew
that
the
husband
had
begun
proceedings
and
that
the
orgreave
business
was
being
damaged
by
the
incompetence
of
jimmie
orgreave
whose
deplorable
wife
had
a
few
days
earlier
been
seen
notoriously
drunk
in
the
of
the
hanbridge
theatre
royal
janet
was
still
at
tavy
mansion
because
there
was
no
place
for
her
in
the
five
towns
janet
had
written
to
hilda
sadly
and
the
letter
breathed
her
sense
of
her
own
futility
and
superfluousness
in
the
social
scheme
in
one
curt
phrase
that
very
afternoon
the
taciturn
maggie
who
very
seldom
complained
had
disclosed
something
of
what
it
was
to
live
day
and
night
with
auntie
hamps
even
clara
the
protected
by
an
almost
impermeable
armour
of
conceit
showed
signs
of
the
anxiety
due
to
obscure
chronic
disease
and
a
husband
who
financially
never
knew
where
he
was
finally
the
last
glories
of
auntie
hamps
were
sinking
to
ashes
only
hilda
herself
was
from
nearly
every
point
of
view
in
a
satisfactory
and
promising
situation
she
possessed
love
health
money
stability
when
danger
threatened
a
quiet
and
unfailingly
sagacious
husband
was
there
to
meet
and
destroy
it
surely
nothing
whatever
worth
mentioning
save
the
fact
that
she
was
distantly
approaching
forty
troubled
the
existence
of
hilda
now
and
her
age
certainly
did
not
trouble
her
ada
entered
with
the
hot
dishes
and
went
out
at
length
hilda
heard
the
bathroom
door
she
left
the
shutting
the
door
on
george
who
could
take
a
hint
very
well
considering
his
years
edwin
brushed
and
spruce
was
coming
downstairs
rubbing
his
clean
hands
with
physical
satisfaction
he
nodded
amiably
but
without
smiling
has
he
gone
said
hilda
in
a
low
voice
edwin
nodded
he
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
did
not
offer
to
kiss
him
having
a
notion
that
he
would
prefer
not
to
be
kissed
just
then
how
much
did
you
give
him
she
knew
he
would
not
care
for
the
question
but
she
could
not
help
putting
it
he
smiled
and
touched
her
shoulder
she
liked
him
to
touch
her
shoulder
that
s
all
right
he
said
with
a
faint
condescension
don
t
you
worry
about
that
she
did
not
press
the
point
he
could
be
free
enough
with
information
except
when
it
was
demanded
some
time
later
he
would
begin
of
his
own
accord
to
talk
how
was
auntie
hamps
well
if
anything
she
s
a
bit
easier
i
don
t
mind
betting
she
gets
over
it
they
went
into
the
almost
side
by
side
and
she
enquired
again
about
his
headache
the
meal
was
tranquil
after
a
few
moments
edwin
opened
the
subject
of
auntie
hamps
s
illness
with
some
sardonic
remarks
upon
the
demeanour
of
albert
benbow
is
auntie
dying
asked
george
with
gusto
edwin
replied
what
are
those
schoolbooks
doing
there
on
the
sideboard
i
thought
it
was
clearly
understood
that
you
were
to
do
your
lessons
in
your
mother
s
boudoir
he
spoke
without
annoyance
but
coldly
he
was
aware
that
neither
hilda
nor
her
son
could
comprehend
that
to
a
bookman
schoolbooks
were
not
books
but
merely
an
eyesore
he
did
not
blame
them
for
their
incapacity
but
he
considered
that
an
arrangement
was
an
arrangement
mother
put
them
there
said
the
base
george
well
you
can
take
them
away
said
edwin
firmly
run
along
now
george
rose
from
his
place
between
hilda
and
edwin
and
from
his
luscious
plate
and
removed
the
books
hilda
watched
him
meekly
go
his
father
too
had
gone
edwin
was
in
the
right
his
position
could
not
be
assailed
he
had
not
been
unpleasant
but
he
had
spoken
as
one
sublimely
confident
that
his
order
would
not
be
challenged
within
her
heart
hilda
rebelled
if
edwin
had
been
responsible
for
some
act
contrary
to
one
of
her
decrees
she
would
never
in
his
presence
have
used
the
tone
that
he
used
to
enforce
obedience
she
would
have
laughed
or
she
would
have
frowned
but
she
would
never
have
been
the
polite
autocrat
nor
would
he
have
expected
her
to
play
the
rôle
he
would
probably
have
resented
it
why
were
they
not
equals
no
they
were
not
equals
the
fundamental
unuttered
assumption
upon
which
the
household
life
rested
was
that
they
were
not
equals
she
might
cross
him
she
might
momentarily
defy
him
she
might
torture
him
she
might
drive
him
to
fury
and
still
be
safe
from
any
effective
reprisals
because
his
love
for
her
made
her
necessary
to
his
being
but
in
spite
of
all
that
his
will
remained
the
seat
of
government
and
she
and
george
were
only
the
opposition
in
the
end
she
had
to
incline
she
was
the
complement
of
his
existence
but
he
was
not
the
complement
of
hers
she
was
just
a
parasite
though
an
essential
parasite
why
the
reason
she
judged
was
economic
and
solely
economic
she
rebelled
was
she
not
as
individual
as
original
as
he
had
she
not
a
powerful
mind
of
her
own
experience
of
her
own
ideals
of
her
own
was
she
not
of
a
nature
profoundly
and
exceptionally
independent
her
lot
was
unalterable
she
had
of
course
not
the
slightest
desire
to
leave
him
she
was
devoted
to
him
what
irked
her
was
that
even
had
she
had
the
desire
she
could
not
have
fulfilled
it
for
she
was
too
old
now
and
too
enamoured
of
comfort
and
security
to
risk
such
an
enterprise
she
was
a
captive
and
she
recalled
with
a
gentle
pang
less
than
regret
the
days
when
she
was
unhappy
and
free
as
a
man
when
she
could
say
i
will
go
to
london
i
will
leave
london
i
am
deceived
and
ruined
but
i
am
my
own
mistress
these
thoughts
in
the
idyllic
tranquillity
of
the
meal
mingled
below
her
smiling
preoccupations
of
an
honoured
with
the
thoughts
of
her
love
for
her
husband
and
son
and
of
their
excellences
of
the
masculine
love
which
enveloped
and
shielded
her
of
her
security
of
the
tragedy
of
the
bribed
and
dismissed
victim
and
villain
george
cannon
of
the
sorrows
of
some
of
her
friends
and
of
the
dead
in
her
heart
was
the
unquiet
whispering

submit

i
shall
never

hilda
sat
alone
in
the
boudoir
before
the
fire
she
had
just
come
out
of
the
kitchen
and
she
was
wearing
the
white
uniform
of
the
kitchen
unsuited
for
a
boudoir
but
she
wore
it
with
piquancy
the
november
afternoon
had
passed
into
dusk
and
through
the
window
over
the
roofs
of
hulton
street
stars
could
be
seen
in
a
darkening
clear
sky
after
a
very
sharp
fall
and
rise
of
the
barometer
accounting
for
heavy
rainstorms
the
first
frosts
were
announced
and
winter
was
on
the
doorstep
the
hardy
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
hilda
among
them
were
bracing
themselves
to
the
discipline
of
winter
with
its
mud
increased
smuts
sleet
and
damp
piercing
chills
and
they
were
taking
pleasure
in
the
tonic
prospect
of
discomfort
the
visitation
had
threatened
ever
since
september
now
it
had
positively
come
let
it
come
build
up
the
fire
stamp
the
feet
and
defy
it
hilda
was
exhilarated
having
been
reawakened
to
the
zest
and
the
romance
of
life
not
merely
by
the
onset
of
winter
but
by
dramatic
events
in
the
kitchen
a
little
over
three
years
had
elapsed
since
the
closing
of
the
episode
of
george
cannon
and
for
two
of
those
years
hilda
had
had
peace
in
the
kitchen
she
had
been
the
firm
mistress
who
knows
what
she
wants
and
knowing
also
how
to
handle
the
peculiar
inmates
of
the
kitchen
gets
it
she
had
been
the
mistress
who
won
t
put
up
with
all
sorts
of
things
including
and
ugliness
in
servants
and
whom
heaven
has
spoilt
by
too
much
favour
then
the
cook
with
the
ingratitude
of
a
cherished
domestic
had
fallen
in
love
and
carried
her
passion
into
a
cottage
miles
away
at
longshaw
and
from
that
moment
hilda
had
ceased
to
be
the
mistress
who
by
firmness
commands
fate
she
had
become
as
other
mistresses
in
a
year
she
had
had
five
cooks
giving
varying
degrees
of
intense
dissatisfaction
she
had
even
dismissed
the
slim
and
constant
ada
once
but
yielding
to
an
outburst
of
penitent
affection
had
withdrawn
the
notice
the
last
cook
far
removed
from
youthfulness
or
prettiness
had
left
suddenly
that
day
after
insolence
after
the
discovery
of
secret
beer
and
other
vileness
in
the
after
a
scene
in
which
hilda
had
absolutely
silenced
her
reducing
ribaldry
to
sobs
cook
and
trunk
expelled
hilda
had
gone
about
the
house
like
a
fumigation
and
into
the
kitchen
like
the
embodiment
of
calm
and
gay
efficiency
she
would
do
the
cooking
herself
she
would
show
the
kitchen
that
she
was
dependent
upon
nobody
she
had
quickened
the
speed
of
ada
accused
her
tartly
but
not
without
dry
of
a
disloyal
secretiveness
and
counselled
her
to
mind
what
she
was
about
if
she
wanted
to
get
on
in
the
world
edwin
knew
nothing
for
all
had
happened
since
his
departure
to
the
works
after
midday
dinner
he
would
be
back
in
due
course
and
george
would
be
back
and
tertius
ingpen
long
ago
reconciled
was
coming
for
the
evening
she
would
show
them
all
three
what
a
meal
was
and
incidentally
ada
would
learn
what
a
meal
was
there
was
nothing
like
demonstrating
to
servants
that
you
could
beat
them
easily
at
their
own
game
she
had
just
lived
through
her
birthday
forty
she
had
murmured
to
herself
with
a
shiver
of
apprehension
meaning
that
the
next
would
be
the
fortieth
it
was
an
unpleasant
experience
she
had
told
edwin
not
to
mention
her
birthday
abroad
clumsy
george
had
enquired
mother
how
old
are
you
to
which
she
had
replied
for
meddlers
a
familiar
phrase
whose
origin
none
of
them
understood
but
george
knew
that
it
signified
mind
your
own
business
no
she
had
not
been
happy
on
that
birthday
she
had
gazed
into
the
glass
and
decided
that
she
looked
old
that
she
did
not
look
old
that
she
looked
old
endlessly
alternating
she
was
not
stout
but
her
body
was
solid
too
solid
it
had
no
litheness
none
whatever
it
was
absolutely
set
the
cleft
under
the
chin
was
quite
undeniable
and
the
olive
complexion
subtly
ravaged
still
not
a
hair
of
her
dark
head
had
changed
colour
it
was
perhaps
her
soul
that
was
greying
her
married
life
was
fairly
calm
it
had
grown
monotonous
in
ease
and
tranquillity
the
sharp
respectful
admiration
for
her
husband
roused
in
her
by
his
handling
of
the
cannon
episode
had
gradually
been
dulled
she
had
nothing
against
him
yet
she
had
everything
against
him
because
apart
from
his
grave
abiding
love
for
her
he
possessed
an
object
and
interest
in
life
and
because
she
was
a
mere
complement
and
he
was
not
she
had
asked
herself
the
most
dreadful
of
questions
why
have
i
lived
why
do
i
go
on
living
and
had
answered
because
of
meaning
edwin
and
her
son
but
it
was
not
enough
for
her
who
had
once
been
violently
enterprising
pugnacious
endangered
and
independent
for
after
she
had
watched
over
them
she
had
energy
to
spare
and
such
energy
was
not
being
employed
and
could
not
be
employed
reading
a
diversion
fancy
work
a
detestable
device
for
killing
time
and
energy
social
duties
ditto
charity
hateful
she
had
slowly
descended
into
marriage
as
into
a
lotus
valley
and
more
than
half
her
life
was
gone
she
could
never
detect
that
any
other
married
woman
in
the
town
felt
as
she
felt
she
could
never
explain
herself
to
edwin
and
indeed
had
not
tried
to
explain
herself
now
the
affair
of
the
alcoholic
cook
aided
by
winter
s
first
fillip
stimulated
and
brightened
her
and
while
thinking
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
of
the
precise
moment
when
she
must
return
to
the
kitchen
and
put
a
dish
down
to
the
fire
she
also
thought
rather
hopefully
and
then
quite
hopefully
about
the
future
of
her
marriage
her
brain
seemed
to
straighten
and
correct
itself
like
the
brain
of
one
who
waking
up
in
the
morning
slowly
perceives
that
the
apprehensiveness
about
eventualities
was
all
awry
in
its
pessimism
she
saw
that
everything
could
and
must
be
improved
that
the
new
life
must
begin
edwin
needed
to
be
inspired
she
must
inspire
him
he
slouched
more
and
more
in
his
walk
he
was
more
and
more
absorbed
in
his
business
quieter
in
the
evenings
more
impatient
in
the
mornings
moreover
the
household
machine
had
been
getting
slack
a
general
tonic
was
required
she
would
administer
it
and
to
herself
also
they
should
all
feel
the
invigorating
ozone
that
very
night
she
would
organise
social
distractions
on
behalf
of
the
home
she
would
reclaim
from
the
works
those
odd
hours
and
of
edwin
s
which
it
had
imperceptibly
filched
she
would
have
some
new
clothes
and
she
would
send
edwin
to
the
tailor
s
she
would
make
him
buy
a
and
a
horse
oh
she
could
do
it
she
had
the
mastery
of
him
in
many
things
when
she
chose
to
be
aroused
in
a
word
she
would
branch
out
she
was
not
sure
that
she
would
not
prosecute
a
campaign
for
putting
edwin
on
the
town
council
where
he
certainly
ought
to
be
it
was
his
duty
to
take
a
share
in
public
matters
and
ultimately
to
dominate
the
town
suggestions
had
already
been
made
by
wirepullers
and
unreflectively
repulsed
by
the
too
casual
edwin
she
saw
him
mayor
and
herself
mayoress
once
the
prospect
of
any
such
formal
honour
with
all
that
it
entailed
of
ceremoniousness
and
insincere
civilities
would
have
annoyed
if
not
frightened
her
but
now
she
thought
proudly
and
timidly
and
desirously
that
she
would
make
as
good
a
mayoress
as
most
mayoresses
and
that
she
could
set
one
or
two
of
them
an
example
in
tact
and
dignity
why
not
of
late
neither
mayors
nor
mayoresses
in
the
five
towns
had
been
what
they
used
to
be
the
grand
tradition
was
apparently
in
abeyance
the
people
who
ought
to
carry
it
on
seeming
somehow
to
despise
it
she
could
remember
mayors
especially
chief
bailiffs
at
turnhill
who
imposed
themselves
upon
the
imagination
of
the
town
but
nowadays
the
name
of
a
mayor
was
never
a
household
word
she
had
even
heard
ingpen
ask
edwin
see
who
is
the
new
mayor
and
edwin
start
his
halting
answer
let
me
see
and
she
had
still
another
and
perhaps
greater
ambition
to
possess
a
country
house
in
her
fancy
her
country
house
was
very
like
alicia
hesketh
s
house
tavy
mansion
which
she
had
never
ceased
to
envy
she
felt
that
in
a
new
home
spacious
with
space
around
it
she
could
really
commence
the
new
life
she
saw
the
place
perfectly
appointed
and
functioning
perfectly
no
bother
about
smuts
on
white
curtains
no
servants
none
of
the
base
confined
promiscuity
of
filthy
trafalgar
road
and
the
benbows
and
auntie
hamps
at
least
eight
or
ten
miles
off
she
saw
herself
driving
edwin
to
the
station
in
the
morning
or
perhaps
right
into
bursley
if
she
wanted
to
shop
no
she
would
of
course
shop
at
oldcastle
she
would
leave
old
darius
clayhanger
s
without
one
regret
and
in
the
new
life
she
would
be
always
active
busy
dignified
elegant
influential
and
kind
and
to
edwin
she
would
be
absolutely
indispensable
in
these
imaginings
their
solid
but
tarnished
love
glittered
and
gleamed
again
she
saw
naught
but
the
charming
side
of
edwin
and
the
romantic
side
of
their
union
she
was
persuaded
that
there
really
was
nobody
like
edwin
and
that
no
marriage
had
ever
had
quite
the
mysterious
secretly
exciting
quality
of
hers
she
yearned
for
him
to
come
home
at
once
to
appear
magically
in
the
dusk
of
the
doorway
the
mood
was
marvellous
ii
the
door
opened
can
i
speak
to
you
m
m
it
was
the
voice
of
ada
somewhat
perturbed
she
advanced
a
little
and
stood
darkly
in
front
of
the
open
doorway
what
is
it
ada
hilda
asked
curtly
without
turning
to
look
at
her
it
s
ada
began
and
stopped
hilda
glanced
round
quickly
recognising
now
in
the
voice
a
peculiar
note
with
which
experience
had
familiarised
her
it
was
a
note
between
pertness
and
the
beginning
of
a
sob
and
it
always
indicated
that
ada
was
feeling
more
acutely
than
usual
the
vast
injustice
of
the
worldly
scheme
it
might
develop
into
tears
on
the
other
hand
it
might
develop
into
mere
insolence
hilda
discerned
that
ada
was
wearing
neither
cap
nor
apron
she
thought
if
this
stupid
girl
wants
trouble
she
has
come
to
me
at
exactly
and
precisely
the
right
moment
to
get
it
i
m
not
in
the
humour
after
all
i
ve
gone
through
to
stand
any
nonsense
either
from
her
or
from
anybody
else
what
is
it
ada
she
repeated
with
restraint
and
yet
warningly
and
where
s
your
apron
and
your
cap
in
the
kitchen
m
m
well
go
and
put
them
on
and
then
come
and
say
what
you
have
to
say
said
hilda
thinking
i
don
t
give
any
importance
to
her
cap
and
apron
but
she
does
i
was
thinking
i
d
better
give
ye
notice
m
m
said
ada
and
she
said
it
pertly
ignoring
the
command
the
two
women
were
alone
together
in
the
house
each
felt
it
each
felt
the
large
dark
emptiness
of
the
house
behind
them
and
the
solid
front
and
back
doors
cutting
them
off
from
succour
each
had
to
depend
entirely
upon
herself
hilda
asked
quietly
what
s
the
matter
now
she
knew
that
ada
s
grievance
would
prove
to
be
silly
the
girl
had
practically
no
commonsense
not
one
servant
girl
in
a
hundred
had
any
appreciable
commonsense
and
when
girls
happened
to
be
upset
as
they
were
all
liable
to
be
and
as
ada
by
the
violent
departure
of
the
cook
no
doubt
was
even
such
minute
traces
of
gumption
as
they
possessed
were
apt
to
disappear
there
s
no
pleasing
you
m
m
said
ada
the
way
you
talked
to
me
in
the
kitchen
saying
i
was
always
things
from
ye
i
ve
felt
it
very
much
she
threw
her
head
back
and
the
gesture
signified
i
m
younger
than
you
and
young
men
are
always
running
after
me
and
i
can
get
a
new
situation
any
time
and
i
ve
not
gone
back
into
my
kitchen
to
put
my
cap
and
apron
on
ada
said
hilda
shall
i
tell
you
what
s
wrong
with
you
you
re
a
little
fool
you
know
you
re
talking
rightdown
nonsense
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
and
you
know
you
ll
never
get
a
better
place
than
you
have
here
but
you
ve
taken
an
idea
into
your
head
and
there
you
are
now
do
be
sensible
you
say
you
think
you
d
better
give
notice
think
it
over
before
you
do
anything
ridiculous
sleep
on
it
we
ll
see
how
you
feel
in
the
morning
i
think
i
d
better
give
notice
m
m
especially
seeing
i
m
a
fool
and
silly
ada
persisted
hilda
sighed
her
voice
hardened
slightly
so
you
d
leave
me
without
a
maid
just
at
christmas
and
that
s
all
the
thanks
i
get
for
all
i
ve
done
for
you
well
m
m
we
ve
had
such
a
queer
lot
of
girls
here
lately
haven
t
we
the
pertness
was
intensified
i
don
t
hardly
care
to
stay
i
feel
we
sh
d
both
be
better
for
a
change
like
it
was
perhaps
ada
s
subtly
insolent
use
of
the
word
we
and
both
that
definitely
brought
about
a
new
phase
of
the
interview
hilda
suddenly
lost
all
desire
for
an
amicable
examination
of
the
crisis
very
well
ada
she
said
shortly
but
remember
i
shan
t
take
you
back
again
whatever
happens
ada
moved
away
and
then
returned
could
i
leave
at
once
m
m
same
as
cook
hilda
was
astonished
and
outraged
despite
all
her
experience
and
its
resulting
secret
sardonic
cynicism
in
regard
to
servants
the
girl
was
ready
to
walk
out
instantly
and
may
i
enquire
where
you
d
go
to
asked
hilda
with
a
sneer
at
this
time
of
night
you
couldn
t
possibly
get
home
to
your
parents
oh
answered
ada
brightly
i
could
go
to
me
cousin
s
up
at
toft
end
and
her
could
send
down
a
lad
with
a
barrow
for
me
box
the
plot
then
had
been
thought
out
her
cousin
s
thought
hilda
and
seemed
to
be
putting
her
finger
on
the
cause
of
ada
s
disloyalty
her
cousin
s
it
was
a
light
in
a
dark
mystery
her
cousin
s
i
suppose
you
know
you
re
forfeiting
the
wages
due
to
you
the
day
after
i
shall
ask
me
cousin
about
that
m
m
said
ada
as
it
were
menacingly
i
should
hilda
sarcastically
agreed
i
certainly
should
and
she
thought
with
bitter
resignation
she
ll
have
to
leave
anyhow
after
this
she
may
as
well
leave
on
the
spot
there
s
those
as
ll
see
as
i
have
me
rights
said
ada
pugnaciously
with
another
toss
of
the
head
hilda
had
a
mind
to
retort
in
anger
but
she
controlled
herself
already
that
afternoon
she
had
imperilled
her
dignity
in
the
altercation
with
the
cook
the
cook
however
had
not
ada
s
ready
tongue
and
while
the
mistress
had
come
off
best
against
the
cook
she
might
through
impulsiveness
find
herself
worsted
by
ada
s
more
youthful
impudence
were
it
once
unloosed
that
will
do
then
ada
she
said
you
can
go
and
pack
your
box
first
thing
in
less
than
three
quarters
of
an
hour
ada
was
gone
and
her
corded
trunk
lay
just
within
the
scullery
door
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
cousin
s
barrow
she
had
bumped
it
down
the
stairs
herself
all
solitary
in
the
house
which
had
somehow
been
transformed
into
a
strange
and
unusual
house
hilda
wept
she
had
only
parted
with
an
unfaithful
and
ungrateful
servant
but
she
wept
she
dashed
into
the
kitchen
and
began
to
do
ada
s
work
still
weeping
and
she
was
savage
against
her
own
tears
yet
they
continued
softly
to
fall
misting
her
vision
of
fire
and
utensils
and
earthenware
vessels
ada
had
left
everything
in
a
moment
she
had
left
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
the
grease
in
the
square
tin
in
which
the
had
been
cooked
and
the
ashes
in
the
fender
and
in
the
kitchen
teapot
and
a
cup
and
saucer
unwashed
she
had
cared
naught
for
the
inconvenience
she
was
causing
had
shewn
not
the
slightest
consideration
had
walked
off
without
a
pang
smilingly
and
all
servants
were
like
that
such
conduct
might
be
due
as
much
to
want
of
imagination
to
a
simple
inability
to
picture
to
themselves
the
consequences
of
certain
acts
as
to
stark
ingratitude
but
the
consequences
remained
the
same
and
hilda
held
fiercely
to
the
theory
of
stark
ingratitude
she
had
made
ada
she
had
created
her
when
hilda
engaged
her
ada
was
little
more
than
an
girl
that
is
to
say
one
of
those
girls
who
earn
a
few
pence
by
delivering
fresh
from
the
stove
at
a
halfpenny
each
before
breakfast
at
the
houses
of
gormandising
superior
artisans
and
the
true
she
had
been
in
one
situation
prior
to
hilda
s
but
it
was
a
situation
where
she
learnt
nothing
and
could
have
learnt
nothing
nevertheless
she
was
very
quick
to
learn
and
in
a
month
hilda
had
done
wonders
with
her
she
had
taught
her
not
only
her
duties
but
how
to
respect
herself
to
make
the
best
of
herself
and
favourably
to
impress
others
she
had
enormously
increased
ada
s
value
in
the
universe
and
she
had
taught
her
some
worldly
wisdom
and
permitted
and
even
encouraged
certain
coquetries
and
in
the
during
dressings
and
undressings
had
occasionally
treated
her
as
a
soubrette
if
not
as
a
confidante
had
listened
to
her
at
length
and
had
gone
so
far
as
to
ask
her
views
on
this
matter
or
that
the
supreme
honour
for
a
menial
also
she
had
very
conscientiously
nursed
her
in
sickness
she
had
really
liked
ada
and
had
developed
a
sentimental
weakness
for
her
she
had
taken
pleasure
in
her
prettiness
in
her
natural
grace
and
in
her
crude
youth
she
enjoyed
seeing
ada
arrange
a
bedroom
or
answer
the
door
or
serve
a
meal
and
ada
s
stupidity
that
stupidity
of
her
class
which
immovably
underlay
her
superficial
aptitudes
had
not
sufficed
to
spoil
her
affection
for
the
girl
she
had
been
indulgent
to
ada
s
stupidity
she
had
occasionally
in
some
soft
moods
hoped
that
it
was
curable
and
she
had
argued
in
moments
of
discouragement
that
at
any
rate
stupidity
could
be
faithful
in
her
heart
she
had
counted
ada
as
a
friend
as
a
true
standby
in
the
more
or
less
tragic
emergencies
of
the
household
and
now
ada
had
deserted
her
stupidity
had
proved
to
be
neither
faithful
nor
grateful
why
had
ada
been
so
silly
and
so
base
impossible
to
say
a
nothing
a
whim
nerves
fatuity
the
whole
affair
was
horribly
absurd
these
creatures
were
incalculable
of
course
hilda
would
have
been
wiser
not
to
upbraid
her
so
soon
after
the
scene
with
the
cook
and
to
have
spoken
more
smoothly
to
the
chit
in
the
boudoir
hilda
admitted
that
but
what
then
was
that
an
excuse
for
the
chit
s
turpitude
there
must
be
a
limit
to
the
mistress
s
humouring
and
probably
after
all
the
chit
had
meant
to
go
if
she
had
not
meant
to
go
she
would
not
have
entered
the
boudoir
apronless
and
capless
some
rankling
word
some
ridiculous
sympathy
with
the
cook
some
wild
dream
of
a
christmas
holiday
who
could
tell
what
might
have
influenced
her
hilda
gave
it
up
and
returned
to
it
a
thousand
times
one
truth
emerged
and
it
was
the
great
truth
of
housemistresses
namely
that
it
never
never
never
pays
to
be
too
kind
to
servants
servants
do
not
understand
kindness
you
think
they
do
they
themselves
think
they
do
but
they
don
t
they
don
t
and
they
don
t
hilda
went
back
into
the
immensity
of
her
desolating
experience
as
an
employer
of
female
domestic
servants
of
all
kinds
but
chiefly
bad
for
the
landlady
of
a
small
boarding
house
must
take
what
servants
she
can
get
and
she
raged
at
the
persistence
of
the
proof
that
kindness
never
paid
what
did
pay
was
severity
and
inhuman
strictness
and
the
maintenance
of
an
impassable
gulf
between
employer
and
employed
not
again
would
she
make
the
mistake
which
she
had
made
a
hundred
times
she
hardened
herself
to
the
consistency
of
a
and
all
the
time
it
was
the
woman
in
her
not
the
mistress
that
the
hasty
thoughtless
ada
had
wounded
to
the
woman
the
kitchen
was
not
the
same
place
without
ada
ada
on
whom
she
had
utterly
relied
in
the
dilemma
caused
by
the
departure
of
the
cook
as
with
angrily
wet
eyes
she
went
about
her
new
work
in
the
kitchen
she
could
almost
see
the
graceful
ghost
of
ada
tripping
to
and
fro
therein
and
all
that
the
world
and
the
husband
would
know
or
understand
was
that
a
cook
had
been
turned
out
for
drunkenness
and
that
a
quite
sober
had
most
preposterously
walked
after
her
hilda
was
aware
that
in
edwin
she
had
a
severe
though
a
taciturn
critic
of
her
activities
as
employer
of
servants
she
had
no
hope
whatever
of
his
sympathy
and
so
she
closed
all
her
gates
against
him
she
waited
for
him
as
for
an
adversary
and
all
the
lustre
faded
from
her
conception
of
their
love
iii
when
edwin
approached
his
home
that
frosty
evening
he
was
disturbed
to
perceive
that
there
was
no
light
from
the
shining
through
the
panes
of
the
though
some
light
showed
at
the
window
the
blinds
of
which
had
not
been
drawn
what
next
he
thought
crossly
he
was
tired
and
the
keenness
of
the
weather
instead
of
bracing
him
merely
made
him
petulant
he
was
astonished
that
several
women
in
a
house
could
all
forget
such
an
important
act
as
the
lighting
of
the
at
nightfall
never
before
had
the
been
forgotten
and
the
negligence
appeared
to
edwin
as
absolutely
monstrous
the
effect
of
it
on
the
street
the
effect
on
a
possible
caller
was
bad
enough
edwin
while
pretending
to
scorn
social
opinion
was
really
very
deferential
towards
it
but
what
was
worse
was
the
revelation
of
the
feminine
mentality
in
opening
the
door
with
his
latchkey
he
was
purposely
noisy
partly
in
order
to
give
expression
to
his
justified
annoyance
and
partly
to
warn
all
peccant
women
that
the
male
had
arrived
threatening
as
his
feet
fumbled
into
the
interior
gloom
and
he
banged
the
door
he
quite
expected
a
rush
of
at
least
one
apologetic
woman
with
a
box
of
matches
but
nobody
came
nevertheless
he
could
hear
sharp
movements
through
the
door
of
the
kitchen
assuredly
women
had
the
irresponsibility
of
infants
he
glanced
for
an
instant
into
the
the
white
cloth
was
laid
but
the
table
was
actually
not
set
with
unusual
righteous
care
he
wiped
the
mud
off
his
boots
on
the
mat
then
removed
his
hat
and
his
overcoat
took
a
large
new
piece
of
indiarubher
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
on
the
felt
the
radiator
which
despite
all
his
injunctions
and
recommendations
was
almost
cold
and
lastly
he
lighted
the
gas
himself
this
final
act
was
contrary
to
his
own
rule
for
he
had
often
told
hilda
that
half
her
trouble
with
servants
arose
through
her
impatiently
doing
herself
things
which
they
had
omitted
instead
of
ringing
the
bell
and
seeing
the
things
done
but
he
was
not
infrequently
inconsistent
both
in
deed
and
in
thought
for
another
example
he
would
say
superiorly
that
a
woman
could
never
manage
women
ignoring
that
he
the
had
never
been
able
to
manage
hilda
he
turned
to
go
upstairs
at
the
same
moment
somebody
emerged
obscurely
from
the
kitchen
it
was
hilda
in
a
white
apron
oh
i
m
glad
you
ve
lighted
it
said
she
curtly
without
the
least
symptom
of
apology
but
rather
affrontingly
he
continued
his
way
have
you
seen
anything
of
george
she
asked
and
her
tone
stopped
him
yet
she
well
knew
that
he
hated
to
be
stopped
of
an
evening
on
his
way
to
the
bathroom
it
could
not
be
sufficiently
emphasized
that
to
accost
him
before
he
had
descended
from
the
bathroom
was
to
transgress
one
of
the
most
solemn
rules
of
his
daily
life
of
course
i
haven
t
seen
george
he
answered
how
should
i
have
seen
george
because
he
s
not
back
from
school
yet
and
i
can
t
help
wondering
she
was
worrying
about
george
as
usual
he
grunted
and
passed
on
there
s
no
light
on
the
landing
either
he
said
over
the
banisters
i
wish
you
d
see
to
those
servants
of
yours
as
it
happens
there
aren
t
any
servants
her
tone
getting
more
peculiar
with
each
phrase
stopped
him
again
aren
t
any
servants
what
d
you
mean
well
i
found
the
attic
full
of
beer
bottles
so
i
sent
her
off
on
the
spot
sent
who
off
eliza
and
where
s
ada
she
s
gone
too
said
hilda
defiantly
and
as
though
rebutting
an
accusation
before
it
could
be
made
why
she
seemed
to
want
to
and
she
was
very
impertinent
over
it
he
snorted
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
it
s
your
affair
he
muttered
too
scornful
to
ask
details
it
is
said
she
significantly
laconic
in
the
bathroom
vexed
and
gloomy
as
he
brushed
his
nails
and
splashed
in
the
wash
basin
he
mused
savagely
over
the
servant
problem
the
servant
problem
had
been
growing
acute
he
had
predicted
several
times
that
a
crisis
would
arrive
a
crisis
had
arrived
he
was
always
right
his
rightness
was
positively
uncanny
he
had
liked
ada
he
had
not
disliked
the
cook
he
knew
that
hilda
was
to
blame
how
should
she
not
be
to
blame
losing
her
entire
staff
in
one
afternoon
it
was
not
merely
that
she
lacked
the
gift
of
authoritative
control
it
was
also
that
she
had
no
feeling
for
democratic
justice
as
between
one
human
being
and
another
and
yet
among
his
earliest
recollections
of
her
was
her
passionate
sympathy
with
men
on
strike
as
against
their
employers
totally
misleading
manifestations
for
her
a
servant
was
nothing
but
a
servant
she
was
convinced
that
all
her
servants
were
pampered
and
spoilt
and
as
for
edwin
s
treatment
of
his
workpeople
she
considered
it
to
be
ridiculously
criminally
soft
if
she
had
implied
once
she
had
implied
a
hundred
times
that
the
whole
lot
of
them
laughed
at
him
behind
his
back
for
a
sentimental
simpleton
occasionally
edwin
was
quite
outraged
by
her
callousness
the
topic
of
the
day
of
the
day
and
even
of
the
day
the
last
for
tramwaymen
had
been
lately
exciting
the
district
and
edwin
was
distressed
that
in
his
own
house
a
day
for
labour
was
in
vogue
and
that
the
employer
perceived
no
shame
in
it
he
did
not
clearly
see
how
the
shame
was
to
be
abolished
but
he
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
admitted
it
was
not
admitted
from
six
in
the
morning
until
ten
at
night
these
mysterious
young
women
were
the
slaves
of
a
bell
they
had
no
surcease
except
one
long
weekday
evening
each
week
and
a
short
sunday
evening
each
fortnight
at
one
period
hilda
had
had
a
fad
for
getting
them
out
of
bed
at
five
to
cure
them
of
laziness
he
remembered
one
cook
whose
family
lived
at
the
village
of
brindley
edge
five
miles
off
this
cook
on
her
weekday
evening
would
walk
to
brindley
edge
spend
three
quarters
of
an
hour
in
her
home
and
walk
back
to
bursley
reaching
trafalgar
road
just
in
time
to
get
to
bed
hilda
saw
nothing
very
odd
in
that
she
said
the
girl
could
always
please
herself
about
going
to
brindley
edge
edwin
s
democratic
sense
was
gradually
growing
in
force
it
disturbed
more
and
more
the
peace
of
his
inmost
mind
he
seldom
displayed
his
sympathies
save
to
tertius
ingpen
who
though
a
tory
was
in
some
ways
astoundingly
open
to
ideas
which
seemed
to
interest
him
as
a
pretty
equation
would
interest
him
but
they
pursued
their
secret
activity
in
his
being
annoying
him
at
his
lithographic
works
and
still
more
in
his
home
he
would
suppress
them
and
grin
and
repeat
his
ancient
consoling
truth
that
what
was
was
the
relief
however
was
not
permanent
in
that
year
the
discovery
of
rontgen
rays
the
practical
invention
of
the
incandescent
the
abolition
of
the
man
with
the
red
flag
in
front
of
vehicles
and
the
fact
that
consols
stood
at
had
combined
to
produce
in
innumerable
hearts
the
illusion
that
civilisation
was
advancing
at
a
great
rate
but
edwin
in
his
soul
scarcely
thought
so
he
was
worrying
not
only
about
liberal
principles
but
about
the
world
in
his
youth
he
had
never
worried
about
the
world
and
of
his
own
personal
success
he
would
ask
and
ask
is
it
right
he
said
to
himself
in
the
bathroom
there
s
a
million
domestic
servants
in
this
blessed
country
and
not
one
of
them
works
less
than
a
hundred
hours
a
week
and
nobody
cares
i
don
t
think
i
really
care
myself
but
there
it
is
all
the
same
and
he
was
darkly
resentful
against
hilda
on
account
of
the
entire
phenomenon
he
foresaw
too
a
period
of
upset
and
discomfort
in
his
house
would
there
indeed
ever
be
any
real
tranquillity
in
his
house
with
that
strange
primeval
in
charge
of
it
as
he
descended
the
stairs
hilda
came
out
of
the
with
an
empty
tray
she
said
i
wish
you
d
go
out
and
look
for
george
imagine
it
going
out
into
the
five
towns
to
look
for
one
boy
oh
he
ll
be
all
right
i
suppose
you
haven
t
forgotten
ingpen
s
coming
of
course
i
haven
t
but
i
want
you
to
go
out
and
look
for
george
he
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
namely
an
absurd
vision
of
george
and
his
new
bicycle
crushed
under
a
tramcar
somewhere
between
bleakridge
and
hanbridge
in
that
year
everybody
with
any
pretension
to
youthfulness
and
modernity
rode
a
bicycle
both
edwin
and
hilda
rode
occasionally
such
was
the
power
of
fashion
maternal
apprehensions
had
not
sufficed
to
keep
george
from
having
a
bicycle
nor
from
riding
on
it
unprotected
up
and
down
the
greasy
slopes
of
trafalgar
road
to
and
from
school
edwin
himself
had
bought
the
bicycle
danger
and
asserting
that
anyhow
normal
risks
must
always
be
accepted
with
an
even
mind
he
was
about
to
declare
that
he
would
certainly
not
do
anything
so
silly
as
to
go
out
and
look
for
george
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
the
queer
sensation
of
being
alone
with
hilda
in
the
house
made
strange
and
romantic
by
a
domestic
calamity
he
gazed
at
hilda
with
her
apron
and
the
calamity
had
made
her
strange
and
romantic
also
he
was
vexed
annoyed
despondent
gloomy
fearful
of
the
immediate
future
he
had
immense
grievances
he
hated
hilda
he
loathed
giving
way
to
her
he
thought
what
is
it
binds
me
to
this
incomprehensible
woman
i
will
not
be
bound
but
he
felt
that
he
would
be
compelled
not
by
her
but
by
something
in
himself
to
commit
the
folly
of
going
out
to
look
for
george
and
he
felt
that
though
his
existence
was
an
exasperating
adventure
still
it
was
an
adventure
oh
damn
he
exploded
and
reached
for
a
cap
and
then
george
came
into
the
hall
through
the
kitchen
the
boy
often
preferred
to
enter
by
the
back
the
stalking
indian
way
iv
george
wore
spectacles
he
had
grown
considerably
he
was
now
between
fourteen
and
fifteen
years
of
age
and
he
had
begun
to
look
his
age
his
mental
outlook
and
conversation
were
on
the
whole
in
advance
of
his
age
even
when
he
was
younger
he
had
frequently
an
adult
manner
of
wise
talking
but
it
had
appeared
unreal
naïve
it
was
amusing
rather
than
convincing
now
he
imposed
himself
even
on
his
family
as
a
genuine
adolescent
though
the
idiom
he
employed
was
often
schoolboyish
and
his
gestures
were
immaturely
rough
the
fact
was
he
was
not
the
same
boy
everybody
noticed
it
his
old
charm
and
delicacy
seemed
to
have
gone
and
his
voice
was
going
he
had
become
harsh
defiant
somewhat
brutal
and
egotistic
if
not
conceited
he
held
a
very
low
opinion
of
all
his
and
did
not
conceal
it
yet
he
was
not
very
high
in
his
form
the
lower
fifth
his
reports
were
mediocre
and
he
cut
no
figure
in
the
playfield
in
the
home
he
was
charged
with
idleness
selfishness
and
irresolution
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
was
not
making
the
best
of
his
gifts
and
that
if
he
only
chose
to
make
the
best
of
them
he
might
easily
etc
apparently
he
did
not
care
a
bit
he
had
marked
facility
on
the
piano
but
he
had
insisted
on
giving
up
his
piano
lessons
and
would
not
open
the
piano
for
a
fortnight
at
a
time
he
still
maintained
his
intention
of
being
an
architect
but
he
had
ceased
to
show
any
interest
in
architecture
he
would
however
still
paint
in
and
he
read
a
lot
but
gluttonously
without
taste
edwin
and
hilda
and
especially
hilda
did
not
hide
their
discontent
hilda
had
outbursts
against
him
in
regard
to
hilda
he
was
disobedient
edwin
always
spoke
quietly
to
him
and
was
seldom
seriously
disobeyed
when
disobeyed
edwin
would
show
a
taciturn
resentment
against
the
boy
who
would
sulk
and
then
melt
oh
he
ll
grow
out
of
it
edwin
would
say
to
hilda
yet
edwin
like
hilda
thought
that
the
boy
was
deliberately
naughty
and
they
held
themselves
towards
him
as
grieved
persons
of
superior
righteousness
towards
a
person
of
inferior
righteousness
not
even
edwin
reflected
that
profound
molecular
changes
might
be
proceeding
in
george
s
brain
for
which
changes
he
was
in
no
way
responsible
nevertheless
despite
the
blighting
disappointment
of
george
s
evolution
the
home
was
by
no
means
deeply
engloomed
no
george
had
an
appealing
smile
a
mere
gawky
boyishness
a
peculiar
way
of
existing
that
somehow
made
joy
in
the
home
also
he
was
a
centre
of
intense
and
continual
interest
and
of
this
he
was
very
well
aware
in
passing
through
the
kitchen
george
had
of
course
been
struck
by
the
astounding
absence
of
the
cook
he
had
noticed
further
a
fancy
apron
and
a
cap
lying
on
the
window
sill
therein
and
when
he
came
into
the
hall
the
strange
aspect
of
his
mother
in
a
servant
s
apron
and
his
uncle
proved
to
him
that
something
marvellously
unusual
exciting
and
uplifting
was
afoot
he
was
pleased
agog
and
he
had
the
additional
satisfaction
that
great
events
would
conveniently
divert
attention
from
his
lateness
still
he
must
be
discreet
for
the
adults
were
evidently
at
loggerheads
and
therefore
touchy
he
slipped
between
edwin
and
hilda
with
a
fairly
good
imitation
of
innocent
casualness
as
if
saying
whatever
has
occurred
i
am
guiltless
and
going
on
just
as
usual
ooh
bags
i
he
exclaimed
loudly
at
the
and
seized
the
indiarubber
which
edwin
had
promised
him
his
school
vocabulary
comprised
an
extraordinary
number
of
words
ending
in
he
would
never
for
example
say
first
but
foggs
and
never
second
but
seggs
that
very
morning
for
example
meeting
hilda
on
the
mat
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
had
shocked
her
by
saying
you
go
up
foggs
mother
and
i
ll
go
seggs
george
hilda
severely
protested
her
anxiety
concerning
him
was
now
turned
into
resentment
have
you
had
an
accident
an
accident
said
george
as
though
at
a
loss
yet
he
knew
perfectly
that
his
mother
was
referring
to
the
bicycle
edwin
said
curtly
now
don
t
play
the
fool
have
you
fallen
off
your
bike
look
at
your
overcoat
don
t
leave
that
satchel
there
and
hang
your
coat
up
properly
the
overcoat
was
in
a
grievous
state
a
few
days
earlier
it
had
been
new
besides
money
it
had
cost
an
enormous
amount
of
deliberation
and
discussion
like
everything
else
connected
with
george
against
his
will
edwin
himself
had
been
compelled
to
conduct
george
to
shillitoe
s
the
tailor
s
and
superintend
a
third
for
further
alterations
after
the
overcoat
was
supposed
to
be
finished
and
lo
now
it
had
no
quality
left
but
warmth
efforts
in
regard
to
george
were
always
thus
out
of
proportion
to
the
trifling
results
obtained
at
george
s
age
edwin
doubtless
had
an
overcoat
but
he
positively
could
not
remember
having
one
and
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
schoolboy
overcoat
of
his
had
ever
preoccupied
a
whole
household
for
two
minutes
to
say
nothing
of
a
week
george
s
face
expressed
a
sense
of
injury
and
his
face
hardened
mother
made
me
take
my
overcoat
you
know
i
can
t
cycle
in
my
overcoat
i
ve
not
been
on
my
bicycle
all
day
also
my
lamp
s
broken
he
said
with
gloomy
defiance
his
curiosity
about
wondrous
events
in
the
house
was
quenched
and
edwin
felt
angry
with
hilda
for
having
quite
unjustifiably
assumed
that
george
had
gone
to
school
on
his
bicycle
ought
she
not
to
have
had
the
ordinary
gumption
to
assure
herself
before
worrying
that
the
lad
s
bicycle
was
not
in
the
shed
incredible
thoughtlessness
all
these
alarms
for
nothing
then
why
are
you
so
late
hilda
demanded
diverting
to
george
her
indignation
at
edwin
s
unuttered
but
yet
conveyed
criticism
of
herself
kept
in
all
this
time
hilda
questioned
suspiciously
george
sullenly
nodded
what
for
latin
homework
again
ejaculated
edwin
why
hadn
t
you
done
it
properly
i
had
a
headache
last
night
and
i
ve
got
one
another
of
your
latin
headaches
said
edwin
sarcastically
there
was
nothing
except
possibly
cod
liver
oil
that
george
detested
more
than
edwin
s
serious
sarcasm
the
elders
glanced
at
one
another
and
glanced
away
both
had
the
same
fear
the
dreadful
fear
that
george
might
be
developing
the
worse
characteristics
of
his
father
both
had
vividly
in
mind
the
fact
that
this
boy
was
the
son
of
george
cannon
they
never
mentioned
to
each
other
either
the
fear
or
the
fact
they
dared
not
but
each
knew
the
thoughts
of
the
other
the
boy
was
undoubtedly
crafty
he
could
conceal
subtle
designs
under
a
simple
exterior
he
was
also
undoubtedly
secretive
the
recent
changes
in
his
disposition
had
put
edwin
and
hilda
on
their
guard
and
every
time
young
george
displayed
cunning
or
economised
the
truth
or
lied
the
fear
visited
them
i
hope
he
ll
turn
out
all
right
hilda
had
said
once
edwin
had
nearly
replied
what
are
you
worrying
about
the
sons
of
honest
men
are
often
rascals
why
on
earth
shouldn
t
the
son
of
a
rascal
be
an
honest
man
but
he
had
only
said
with
impatience
of
course
he
ll
turn
out
all
right
not
that
he
himself
was
convinced
edwin
now
attacked
the
boy
gloomily
you
didn
t
seem
to
have
much
of
a
headache
when
you
came
in
just
now
it
was
true
but
george
suddenly
burst
into
tears
his
headaches
were
absolutely
genuine
the
emptiness
of
the
kitchen
and
the
general
queer
look
of
things
in
the
house
had
however
by
their
promise
of
adventurous
happenings
caused
him
to
forget
his
headache
altogether
and
the
discovery
of
the
new
indiarubber
had
been
like
a
tonic
to
a
convalescent
the
menacing
attitude
of
the
elders
had
now
brought
about
a
relapse
the
headache
established
itself
as
his
chief
physical
sensation
his
chief
moral
sensation
was
that
of
a
terrible
grievance
he
did
not
often
cry
he
had
not
indeed
cried
for
about
a
year
but
there
was
something
nervous
in
the
very
air
and
the
sob
took
him
unawares
the
first
sob
having
prostrated
all
resistance
others
followed
victoriously
and
there
was
no
stopping
them
he
did
not
quite
know
why
he
should
have
been
more
liable
to
cry
on
this
particular
occasion
than
on
certain
others
and
he
was
rather
ashamed
on
the
other
hand
it
was
with
an
almost
malicious
satisfaction
that
he
perceived
the
troubling
effect
of
his
tears
on
the
elders
they
were
obviously
in
a
quandary
serve
them
right
it
s
my
eyes
he
blubbered
i
told
you
these
specs
would
never
suit
me
but
you
wouldn
t
believe
me
and
the
headmaster
won
t
believe
me
the
discovery
that
george
s
eyesight
was
defective
about
two
months
earlier
had
led
to
a
desperate
but
of
course
hopeless
struggle
on
his
part
against
the
wearing
of
spectacles
it
was
curious
that
in
the
struggle
he
had
never
even
mentioned
his
strongest
objection
to
spectacles
namely
the
fact
that
bert
benbow
wore
spectacles
why
didn
t
you
tell
us
edwin
demanded
between
sobs
george
replied
with
overwhelming
disillusioned
disgust
what
s
the
good
of
telling
you
anything
you
only
think
i
m
codding
and
he
passed
upstairs
apparently
the
broken
victim
of
fate
and
parents
but
in
reality
triumphant
his
triumph
was
such
that
neither
edwin
nor
hilda
dared
even
to
protest
against
the
use
of
such
an
inexcusable
word
as
hilda
went
into
the
kitchen
and
edwin
rather
aimlessly
followed
her
he
felt
incompetent
he
could
do
nothing
except
carry
trays
and
he
had
no
desire
to
carry
trays
neither
spoke
hilda
was
bending
over
the
fire
then
she
arranged
the
grid
in
front
of
the
fire
to
hold
a
tin
and
she
greased
the
tin
he
thought
she
looked
very
wistful
for
all
the
somewhat
bitter
sturdiness
of
her
demeanour
tertius
ingpen
was
due
for
the
evening
she
had
no
servants
through
her
own
fault
and
now
a
new
phase
had
arrived
in
the
unending
responsibility
for
george
s
welfare
he
knew
that
she
was
blaming
him
on
account
of
george
he
knew
that
she
believed
in
the
sincerity
of
george
s
outburst
he
believed
in
it
himself
the
spectacles
were
wrong
the
headache
was
genuine
and
he
edwin
was
guilty
of
the
spectacles
because
he
had
forced
hilda
by
his
calm
bantering
commonsense
to
consult
a
small
local
optician
of
good
reputation
hilda
had
wanted
to
go
to
birmingham
or
manchester
but
edwin
said
that
such
an
idea
was
absurd
the
best
local
optician
was
good
enough
for
the
great
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
and
would
be
good
enough
for
george
why
not
indeed
why
the
craze
for
specialists
there
could
be
nothing
uniquely
wrong
with
the
boy
s
eyes
it
was
a
temporary
weakness
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
accordance
with
edwin
s
instinct
for
denying
the
existence
of
a
crisis
and
the
local
optician
consulted
had
borne
him
out
the
local
optician
said
that
every
year
he
dealt
with
dozens
of
cases
similar
to
george
s
and
now
both
the
local
optician
and
edwin
were
overthrown
by
a
boy
s
sobbing
tears
suddenly
hilda
turned
round
upon
her
husband
i
shall
take
george
to
london
about
his
eyes
she
said
with
immense
purpose
and
sincerity
in
a
kind
of
fierce
challenge
this
was
her
amends
to
george
for
having
often
disbelieved
him
and
for
having
suspected
him
of
taking
after
his
father
she
made
her
amends
passionately
and
with
all
the
force
of
her
temperament
in
her
eyes
george
was
now
a
martyr
to
london
exclaimed
edwin
weakly
yes
it
s
no
use
half
doing
these
things
i
shall
ask
charlie
orgreave
to
recommend
me
a
oculist
edwin
dared
say
nothing
either
manchester
or
birmingham
would
have
been
just
as
good
as
london
perhaps
better
moreover
she
had
not
even
consulted
him
she
had
decided
by
a
violent
impulse
and
announced
her
decision
this
was
not
right
she
would
have
protested
against
a
similar
act
by
edwin
but
he
could
not
argue
with
her
she
was
far
beyond
argument
i
wouldn
t
have
that
boy
s
eyesight
played
with
for
anything
she
said
fiercely
well
of
course
you
wouldn
t
who
would
edwin
thought
but
he
did
not
say
it
go
and
see
what
he
s
doing
she
said
edwin
slouched
off
he
was
no
longer
the
master
of
the
house
he
was
only
an
economic
factor
and
general
tool
in
the
house
and
as
he
wandered
like
a
culprit
up
the
stairs
of
the
mysteriously
transformed
dwelling
he
thought
again
what
is
it
that
binds
me
to
her
but
he
was
abashed
and
in
spite
of
himself
impressed
by
the
intensity
of
hilda
s
formidable
emotion
nevertheless
as
he
began
vaguely
to
perceive
all
that
was
involved
in
her
threat
to
go
to
london
on
the
morrow
he
stiffened
and
said
to
himself
we
shall
see
about
that
we
shall
just
see
about
that
v
they
were
at
the
meal
hilda
had
covered
george
s
portion
of
fish
with
a
plate
and
put
it
before
the
fire
to
keep
warm
she
was
just
returning
to
the
table
tertius
ingpen
who
sat
with
his
back
to
the
fire
looked
at
her
over
his
shoulder
with
an
admiring
smile
and
said
well
i
ve
had
some
good
meals
in
this
house
but
this
is
certainly
the
best
bit
of
fish
i
ever
tasted
so
that
the
catastrophe
in
the
kitchen
leaves
me
unmoved
hilda
with
face
suddenly
transformed
by
a
responsive
smile
insinuated
herself
between
the
table
and
her
drew
forward
the
chair
by
its
arms
and
sat
down
her
keen
pleasure
in
the
compliment
was
obvious
edwin
noted
that
the
meal
was
really
very
well
served
the
table
brighter
than
usual
the
toast
crisper
and
the
fish
a
fine
piece
of
hake
white
as
snow
within
its
browned
exterior
merely
perfect
there
was
no
doubt
that
hilda
could
be
extremely
efficient
when
she
desired
edwin
s
criticism
was
that
she
was
too
often
negligent
and
that
in
her
moods
of
conscientiousness
she
gave
herself
too
urgently
and
completely
producing
an
unnecessary
disturbance
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
home
nevertheless
edwin
too
felt
pleasure
in
the
compliment
to
hilda
and
he
calmly
enjoyed
the
spectacle
of
his
wife
and
his
friend
side
by
side
on
such
mutually
appreciative
terms
the
intimacy
of
the
illuminated
table
in
the
midst
of
the
darker
room
the
warmth
and
crackling
of
the
fire
the
grave
solidity
of
the
furniture
the
springiness
of
the
thick
carpet
and
the
delicate
odours
of
the
repast
all
these
things
satisfied
in
him
something
that
was
profound
and
the
two
mature
vivacious
intelligent
faces
under
the
shaded
gas
excited
his
loyal
affection
that
s
right
hilda
murmured
in
her
clear
enunciation
i
do
like
praise
now
then
you
callous
brute
said
ingpen
to
edwin
what
do
you
say
and
hilda
cried
with
swift
complaining
sincerity
oh
edwin
never
praises
me
her
sincerity
convinced
by
its
very
artlessness
the
complaint
had
come
unsought
from
her
heart
and
it
was
so
spontaneous
and
forcible
that
tertius
ingpen
as
a
tactful
guest
saw
the
advisability
of
easing
the
situation
by
laughter
yes
i
do
edwin
protested
and
though
he
was
shocked
he
laughed
in
obedience
to
ingpen
s
cue
it
was
true
he
did
praise
her
but
not
frequently
and
almost
always
in
order
to
flatter
her
rather
than
to
express
his
own
emotion
edwin
did
not
care
for
praising
people
he
would
enthusiastically
praise
a
book
but
not
a
human
being
his
way
was
to
take
efficiency
for
granted
not
so
bad
was
a
superlative
of
laudation
with
him
he
was
now
shocked
as
much
by
the
girl
s
outrageous
candour
as
by
the
indisputable
revelation
that
she
went
hungry
for
praise
even
to
a
close
friend
such
as
ingpen
surely
a
wife
had
not
the
right
to
be
quite
so
desperately
sincere
edwin
considered
that
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
husband
and
wife
should
always
at
any
cost
maintain
the
convention
of
perfect
conjugal
amenity
he
knew
couples
who
achieved
the
feat
albert
and
clara
for
example
but
hilda
he
surmised
had
other
ideas
if
indeed
she
had
ever
consciously
reflected
upon
this
branch
of
social
demeanour
certainly
she
seemed
at
moments
to
lose
all
regard
for
appearances
moreover
she
was
polluting
by
acerbity
the
pure
friendliness
of
the
atmosphere
and
endangering
cheer
he
s
too
wrapped
up
in
the
works
to
think
about
praising
his
wife
hilda
continued
still
in
the
disconcerting
vein
of
sincerity
but
with
less
violence
and
a
more
philosophical
air
the
fact
was
that
although
she
had
not
regained
the
zest
of
the
mood
so
rudely
dissipated
by
the
scene
with
ada
she
was
kept
cheerful
by
the
mere
successful
exercise
of
her
own
energy
in
proving
to
these
two
men
that
servants
were
not
in
the
least
essential
to
the
continuance
of
plenary
comfort
in
her
house
and
she
somewhat
condescended
towards
edwin
by
the
way
teddie
said
ingpen
pulling
lightly
at
his
short
beard
i
heard
a
rumour
that
you
were
going
to
stand
for
the
town
council
in
the
south
ward
why
didn
t
you
edwin
looked
a
little
confused
who
told
you
that
tale
it
was
about
it
never
came
from
me
said
edwin
hilda
broke
in
eagerly
he
was
invited
to
stand
but
he
wouldn
t
i
thought
he
ought
to
i
begged
him
to
but
no
he
wouldn
t
and
did
you
know
he
refused
a
too
oh
mumbled
edwin
that
sort
o
thing
s
not
my
line
oh
isn
t
it
ingpen
exclaimed
then
whose
line
is
it
look
at
all
the
rotters
in
the
council
said
edwin
all
the
more
reason
why
you
should
be
on
it
well
i
ve
got
no
time
edwin
finished
gloomily
and
uneasily
ingpen
paused
tapping
his
teeth
with
his
finger
before
proceeding
in
a
judicial
thoughtful
manner
which
in
recent
years
he
had
been
developing
i
ll
tell
you
what
s
the
matter
with
you
old
man
you
don
t
know
it
but
you
re
in
a
groove
you
go
about
like
a
shuttle
from
the
house
to
the
works
and
the
works
to
the
house
and
you
never
think
beyond
the
works
and
the
house
oh
don
t
i
ingpen
went
placidly
on
no
you
don
t
you
ve
become
a
good
specimen
of
the
genus
domesticated
business
you
ve
forgotten
what
life
is
you
fancy
you
re
at
full
stretch
all
the
time
but
you
re
in
a
coma
i
suppose
you
ll
never
see
forty
again
and
have
you
ever
been
outside
this
island
you
went
to
llandudno
this
year
because
you
went
last
year
and
you
ll
go
next
year
because
you
went
this
year
if
you
happen
now
and
then
to
worry
about
the
failure
of
your
confounded
liberal
party
you
think
you
re
a
blooming
publicist
where
are
your
musical
evenings
when
i
asked
you
to
go
with
me
to
a
concert
at
manchester
last
week
but
one
you
thought
i
d
gone
dotty
simply
because
it
meant
your
leaving
the
works
early
and
not
getting
to
bed
until
the
of
one
thirty
i
was
never
told
anything
about
any
concert
hilda
interjected
sharply
go
on
go
on
said
edwin
raising
his
eyebrows
i
will
said
ingpen
with
tranquillity
as
though
discussing
impartially
and
impersonally
the
conduct
of
some
individual
at
the
antipodes
where
am
i
well
you
re
always
buying
books
and
i
believe
you
reckon
yourself
a
bit
of
a
reader
what
d
you
get
out
of
them
i
daresay
you
ve
got
decided
views
on
the
transcendent
question
whether
emily
brontë
was
a
greater
writer
than
charlotte
that
s
about
what
you
ve
got
why
dash
it
you
haven
t
a
vice
left
a
vice
would
interfere
with
your
lovely
litho
there
s
only
one
thing
that
would
upset
you
more
than
a
machinery
breakdown
at
the
works
and
what
s
that
what
s
that
if
one
of
the
hinges
of
your
came
off
or
you
lost
your
latchkey
why
just
look
how
you
ve
evidently
been
struck
all
of
a
heap
by
this
servant
affair
i
expect
it
occurred
to
you
your
breakfast
might
be
five
minutes
late
in
the
morning
stuff
said
edwin
amiably
he
regarded
ingpen
s
observations
as
fantastically
unjust
and
beside
the
mark
but
his
sense
of
fairness
and
his
admiration
of
the
man
s
intellectual
honesty
would
not
allow
him
to
resent
them
ingpen
would
discuss
and
dissect
either
his
friends
or
himself
with
equal
detachment
the
detachment
was
complete
and
his
assumption
that
his
friends
fully
shared
his
own
dispassionate
curious
interest
in
arriving
at
the
truth
appealed
very
strongly
to
edwin
s
loyalty
that
ingpen
was
liable
to
preach
and
even
to
hector
was
a
drawback
which
he
silently
accepted
struck
all
of
a
heap
indeed
muttered
edwin
wasn
t
he
hilda
i
should
just
say
he
was
and
i
know
he
thinks
it
s
all
my
fault
said
hilda
tertius
ingpen
glanced
at
her
an
instant
and
gave
a
short
laugh
which
scarcely
concealed
his
mild
scorn
of
her
feminine
confusion
of
the
argument
it
s
the
usual
thing
said
ingpen
with
scorn
still
more
marked
at
this
stage
of
a
dissertation
he
was
inclined
to
be
less
a
human
being
than
the
trumpet
of
a
sacred
message
it
s
the
usual
thing
i
never
knew
a
happy
marriage
yet
that
didn
t
end
in
the
same
way
then
perceiving
that
he
was
growing
too
earnest
and
that
his
emphasis
on
the
phrase
happy
marriage
had
possibly
been
too
sarcastic
he
sniggered
i
really
don
t
see
what
marriage
has
to
do
with
it
said
hilda
frowning
no
of
course
you
don
t
ingpen
agreed
if
you
d
said
business
she
added
now
we
ve
had
the
diagnosis
edwin
sardonically
remarked
looking
at
his
plate
what
s
the
prescription
he
was
reflecting
happy
marriage
does
he
call
it
why
on
earth
does
she
say
i
think
it
s
all
her
fault
i
ve
not
breathed
a
word
well
replied
ingpen
you
live
much
too
close
to
your
infernal
works
why
don
t
you
get
away
right
away
and
live
out
in
the
country
like
a
sensible
man
instead
of
sticking
in
this
filthy
hole
among
all
these
new
cottages
barbarian
hordes
oh
hurrah
cried
hilda
at
last
i
ve
got
somebody
who
takes
my
side
of
course
you
say
it
s
impossible
you
naturally
would
ingpen
resumed
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
george
soon
after
tertius
ingpen
s
arrival
george
had
been
despatched
to
summon
urgently
tams
the
charwoman
who
had
already
more
than
once
helped
to
fill
a
hiatus
between
two
cooks
george
showed
now
no
trace
of
his
late
martyrdom
nor
of
a
headache
to
conquer
george
in
these
latter
days
you
had
to
demand
of
him
a
service
it
was
edwin
who
had
first
discovered
the
intensity
of
the
boy
s
desire
to
take
a
useful
share
in
any
adult
operation
whatever
he
came
in
rough
defiant
shy
proud
and
making
a
low
intermittent
noise
with
protruding
lips
to
indicate
the
sharpness
of
the
frost
outside
as
he
had
already
greeted
ingpen
he
was
able
to
go
without
ceremony
straight
to
his
chair
confidentially
in
the
silence
hilda
raised
her
eyebrows
to
him
interrogatively
in
reply
he
gave
one
short
nod
thus
in
two
scarcely
perceptible
gestures
the
assurance
was
asked
for
and
given
that
the
mission
had
been
successful
and
that
tams
would
be
coming
up
at
once
george
loved
these
private
and
laconic
signallings
which
produced
in
him
the
illusion
that
he
was
getting
nearer
to
the
enigma
of
life
as
he
persisted
in
the
manifestation
hilda
amicably
murmured
george
pressed
his
lips
swiftly
and
hermetically
together
and
raised
his
eyebrows
in
protest
against
his
own
indecorum
he
glanced
at
his
empty
place
whereupon
hilda
glanced
informingly
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
and
george
skilled
in
the
interpretation
of
minute
signs
skirted
stealthily
round
the
table
behind
his
mother
s
chair
and
snatched
his
loaded
plate
from
the
hearth
nobody
said
a
word
the
sudden
stoppage
of
the
conversation
had
indeed
caused
a
slight
awkwardness
among
the
elders
george
for
his
part
was
quite
convinced
that
they
had
been
discussing
his
eyesight
furnace
all
right
again
sonny
asked
edwin
quietly
when
the
boy
had
sat
down
hilda
was
replenishing
ingpen
s
plate
blop
muttered
george
springing
up
aghast
this
meant
that
he
had
forgotten
the
furnace
in
the
cellar
source
of
heat
to
the
radiator
in
the
hall
by
a
recent
arrangement
he
received
sixpence
a
week
for
stoking
the
furnace
never
mind
it
ll
do
afterwards
said
edwin
but
george
masticating
fish
shook
his
head
he
must
be
stern
with
himself
possibly
to
atone
for
his
tears
and
he
went
off
instantly
to
the
cellar
bit
chill
observed
edwin
to
him
as
he
left
the
room
a
bit
chilly
was
what
he
meant
but
george
delighted
to
chip
the
end
off
a
word
and
when
edwin
chose
to
adopt
the
same
practice
the
boy
took
it
as
a
masonic
sign
of
profound
understanding
between
them
george
nodded
and
vanished
and
both
edwin
and
hilda
dwelt
in
secret
upon
his
boyish
charm
and
affectionate
satisfaction
mingled
with
and
softened
their
apprehensions
and
their
brooding
responsibility
and
remorse
they
thought
he
is
simply
exquisite
and
in
their
hearts
apologised
to
him
tertius
ingpen
asked
suddenly
what
s
happened
to
the
young
man
s
spectacles
they
don
t
suit
him
said
hilda
eagerly
they
don
t
suit
him
at
all
they
give
him
headaches
edwin
would
have
me
take
him
to
the
local
man
what
at
hanbridge
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
risky
but
edwin
would
have
it
i
m
going
to
take
him
to
london
he
s
been
having
headaches
for
some
time
and
never
said
a
word
i
only
found
it
out
by
accident
surely
ingpen
smiled
it
s
contrary
to
george
s
usual
practice
to
hide
his
troubles
like
that
isn
t
it
oh
said
hilda
he
s
rather
secretive
you
know
i
ve
never
noticed
said
ingpen
that
he
was
more
secretive
than
most
of
us
are
about
a
grievance
edwin
secretly
agitated
said
in
a
curious
light
tone
if
you
ask
me
he
kept
it
quiet
just
to
pay
us
out
pay
you
out
what
for
for
making
him
wear
spectacles
at
all
these
kids
want
a
deuce
of
a
lot
of
understanding
but
that
s
my
contribution
he
simply
said
to
himself
well
if
they
think
they
re
going
to
cure
my
eyesight
for
me
with
their
beastly
specs
they
just
aren
t
and
i
won
t
tell
em
edwin
hilda
protested
warmly
i
wonder
you
can
talk
like
that
tertius
ingpen
went
off
into
one
of
his
peculiar
long
fits
of
laughter
and
edwin
quizzically
smiled
feeling
as
if
he
was
repaying
hilda
for
her
unnecessary
insistence
upon
the
fact
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
choosing
of
an
optician
hilda
suspecting
that
the
two
men
saw
something
droll
which
was
hidden
from
her
blushed
and
then
laughed
in
turn
somewhat
don
t
think
it
s
best
to
go
to
london
about
an
affair
like
eyesight
she
asked
ingpen
pointedly
the
chief
thing
in
these
cases
said
ingpen
solemnly
is
to
satisfy
the
maternal
instinct
yes
i
should
certainly
go
to
london
if
teddie
disagrees
i
m
against
him
who
are
you
going
to
you
are
horrid
hilda
exclaimed
and
added
with
positiveness
i
shall
ask
charlie
orgreave
first
he
ll
tell
me
the
best
man
you
seem
to
have
a
great
belief
in
charlie
said
ingpen
i
have
said
hilda
who
had
seen
charlie
at
george
s
bedside
when
nobody
knew
whether
george
would
live
or
die
and
while
they
were
talking
about
charlie
and
about
janet
who
was
now
living
with
her
brother
at
ealing
the
sounds
of
george
stoking
the
furnace
below
came
dully
up
through
the
if
you
and
george
are
going
away
asked
ingpen
what
ll
happen
to
his
worship
with
not
a
servant
in
the
house
this
important
point
had
been
occupying
edwin
s
mind
ever
since
hilda
had
first
announced
her
intention
to
go
to
london
but
he
had
not
mentioned
it
to
her
nor
she
to
him
their
relations
being
rather
delicate
it
had
for
him
only
an
academic
interest
since
he
had
determined
that
she
should
not
go
to
london
on
the
morrow
nevertheless
he
awaited
anxiously
the
reply
hilda
answered
with
composure
i
m
hoping
he
ll
come
with
us
he
had
been
prepared
for
anything
but
this
the
proposition
was
monstrously
impossible
could
a
man
leave
his
works
at
a
moment
s
notice
the
notion
was
utterly
absurd
that
s
quite
out
of
the
question
he
said
at
once
he
was
absolutely
sincere
the
effect
of
ingpen
s
discourse
was
however
such
as
to
upset
the
assured
dignity
of
his
pronouncement
for
the
decision
was
simply
an
illustration
of
ingpen
s
theory
concerning
him
he
blushed
why
is
it
out
of
the
question
demanded
hilda
inimically
gazing
at
him
she
had
lost
her
lenient
attitude
towards
him
of
the
afternoon
nevertheless
reflecting
upon
tertius
ingpen
s
indictment
of
the
usual
happy
marriage
she
had
been
planning
the
expedition
to
london
as
a
revival
of
romance
in
their
lives
she
saw
it
as
a
marvellous
rejuvenating
experience
when
she
thought
of
all
that
she
had
suffered
and
all
that
edwin
had
suffered
in
order
that
they
might
come
together
she
was
quite
desolated
by
the
prosaic
flatness
of
the
ultimate
result
was
it
to
attain
their
present
stolid
existence
that
they
had
endured
affliction
for
a
decade
she
wanted
passionately
to
break
the
mysterious
bands
that
held
them
both
back
from
ecstasy
and
romance
and
he
would
not
help
her
he
would
not
enter
into
her
desire
she
had
known
that
he
would
refuse
he
refused
everything
he
was
so
set
in
his
own
way
resentment
radiated
from
her
i
can
t
said
edwin
what
d
you
want
to
go
for
what
does
a
day
or
two
matter
then
she
loosed
her
tongue
why
because
you
couldn
t
trifle
with
a
child
s
eyesight
already
the
thing
had
been
dragging
on
for
goodness
knew
how
long
every
day
might
be
of
importance
and
why
not
they
could
shut
the
house
up
and
go
off
together
and
stay
at
charlie
s
hadn
t
janet
asked
them
many
a
time
maggie
would
look
out
for
new
servants
and
tams
would
clean
the
house
it
was
really
the
best
way
out
of
the
servant
question
too
besides
being
the
best
for
george
and
there
s
another
thing
she
went
on
without
a
pause
speaking
rapidly
and
clearly
your
eyes
want
seeing
to
as
well
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
she
sneered
mine
he
exclaimed
my
eyes
are
as
right
as
rain
it
was
not
true
his
eyes
had
been
troubling
him
then
why
have
you
had
a
double
fixed
at
your
when
a
single
one
s
been
enough
for
you
all
these
years
she
demanded
i
just
thought
of
it
that
s
all
said
edwin
glumly
and
with
no
attempt
to
be
diplomatic
anyhow
i
can
t
go
to
london
and
when
i
want
an
oculist
he
finished
with
grimness
hanbridge
ll
be
good
enough
for
me
i
m
thinking
strange
she
had
never
before
said
a
word
to
him
about
his
eyes
then
what
shall
you
do
while
i
m
away
she
asked
implacably
but
if
she
was
implacable
he
also
could
be
implacable
if
she
insisted
on
leaving
him
in
the
lurch
well
she
should
leave
him
in
the
lurch
tertius
ingpen
was
witness
of
a
plain
breach
between
them
it
was
unfortunate
it
was
wholly
hilda
s
fault
but
he
had
to
face
the
fact
i
don
t
know
he
replied
curtly
the
next
moment
george
returned
hasn
t
tams
been
quick
mother
said
george
she
s
come
vi
in
the
after
the
meal
edwin
could
hear
through
the
half
open
door
the
sounds
of
conversation
between
hilda
and
tams
with
an
occasional
word
from
george
who
was
going
to
help
tams
to
put
the
things
away
after
she
had
washed
and
wiped
the
voice
of
tams
was
very
gentle
and
comforting
edwin
s
indignant
pity
went
out
to
her
why
should
tams
thus
cheerfully
bear
the
misfortunes
of
others
why
should
she
at
a
moment
s
notice
leave
a
cottageful
of
young
children
and
a
husband
liable
at
any
time
to
get
drunk
and
maim
either
them
or
her
in
order
to
meet
a
crisis
caused
by
hilda
s
impulsiveness
and
lack
of
tact
the
answer
as
in
so
many
cases
was
of
course
economic
tams
could
not
afford
not
to
be
at
clayhanger
s
instant
call
also
she
was
born
the
victim
of
her
own
altruism
her
soul
was
soft
like
her
plump
cushionlike
body
and
she
lived
as
naturally
in
injustice
as
a
fish
in
water
but
could
anything
excuse
those
who
took
advantage
of
such
an
economic
system
and
such
a
devoted
nature
edwin
s
conscience
uneasily
stirred
he
could
have
blushed
however
he
was
helpless
and
he
was
basely
glad
that
he
was
helpless
that
it
was
no
affair
of
his
after
all
and
that
tams
had
thus
to
work
out
her
destiny
to
his
own
benefit
he
saw
in
her
a
seraph
for
the
next
world
and
yet
in
this
world
he
contentedly
felt
himself
her
superior
and
her
voice
soothing
acquiescent
expressive
of
the
spirit
which
gathers
in
extraneous
woes
as
the
mediæval
saint
drew
to
his
breast
the
swords
of
the
executioners
continued
to
murmur
in
the
hall
edwin
thought
i
alone
in
this
house
feel
the
real
significance
of
tams
i
m
sure
she
doesn
t
feel
it
herself
but
these
reflections
were
only
the
vague
unimportant
background
to
the
great
matter
in
his
mind
the
difficulty
with
hilda
when
he
had
entered
the
house
questions
of
gaslight
and
blinds
were
enormous
to
him
the
immense
general
question
of
servants
had
diminished
them
to
a
trifle
then
the
question
of
george
s
headache
and
eyesight
had
taken
precedence
and
now
the
relations
of
husband
and
wife
were
mightily
paramount
over
everything
else
tertius
ingpen
having
as
usual
opened
the
piano
was
idly
diverting
himself
with
strange
chords
while
cigarette
smoke
rose
into
his
eyes
making
him
blink
like
edwin
ingpen
was
a
little
after
the
open
trouble
in
the
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
pretend
that
trouble
did
not
exist
on
the
other
hand
the
trouble
was
not
of
the
kind
that
could
be
referred
to
by
even
a
very
intimate
friend
the
acknowledgment
of
it
had
to
be
mute
but
in
addition
to
being
ingpen
was
also
triumphant
there
was
a
peculiar
sardonic
and
somewhat
disdainful
look
on
his
face
as
he
mused
over
the
chords
trying
to
keep
the
cigarette
smoke
out
of
his
eyes
his
oblique
glance
seemed
to
be
saying
to
edwin
what
have
i
always
told
you
about
women
well
you
ve
married
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
your
wife
s
no
worse
than
other
wives
here
am
i
free
and
wouldn
t
you
like
to
be
in
my
place
my
boy
how
wise
i
have
been
edwin
resented
these
unspoken
observations
the
contrast
between
ingpen
s
specious
support
and
flattery
of
hilda
when
she
was
present
and
his
sardonic
glance
when
she
was
absent
was
altogether
too
marked
himself
in
revolt
against
the
institution
of
marriage
edwin
could
not
bear
that
ingpen
should
attack
it
edwin
had
so
far
as
concerned
the
outside
world
taken
the
institution
of
marriage
under
his
protection
moreover
ingpen
s
glance
was
a
criticism
of
hilda
such
as
no
husband
ought
to
permit
and
it
was
also
a
criticism
of
the
husband
that
slave
and
dupe
yet
at
bottom
what
edwin
resented
was
ingpen
s
contemptuous
pity
for
the
slave
and
the
dupe
why
london
and
why
said
edwin
cheerfully
with
a
superior
philosophical
air
as
though
impartially
studying
an
argumentative
position
as
though
he
could
regard
the
temporary
vagaries
of
an
otherwise
fine
sensible
woman
with
bland
detachment
he
said
it
because
he
was
obliged
to
say
something
in
order
to
prove
that
he
was
neither
a
slave
nor
a
dupe
ask
me
another
replied
ingpen
curtly
continuing
to
produce
chords
well
we
shall
see
said
edwin
mysteriously
firmly
and
loftily
meaning
that
if
his
opinion
were
invited
his
opinion
would
be
that
hilda
would
not
go
away
and
that
whenever
she
went
she
would
not
go
to
london
he
had
decided
to
have
a
grand
altercation
with
his
wife
that
night
when
ingpen
and
tams
had
departed
and
george
was
asleep
and
they
had
the
house
to
themselves
he
knew
his
ground
and
he
could
force
a
decisive
battle
he
felt
no
doubt
as
to
the
result
the
news
of
his
triumph
should
reach
ingpen
ingpen
was
apparently
about
to
take
up
the
conversation
when
george
came
clumsily
and
noisily
into
the
all
his
charm
seemed
to
have
left
him
i
thought
you
were
going
to
help
said
edwin
so
i
am
george
challenged
him
and
lacking
the
courage
to
stop
at
that
point
added
but
they
aren
t
ready
yet
let
s
try
those
haydn
bits
george
ingpen
suggested
oh
no
said
george
curtly
ingpen
and
the
boy
had
begun
to
play
easy
fragments
of
duets
together
edwin
said
with
sternness
sit
down
to
that
piano
and
do
as
ingpen
asks
you
george
flushed
and
looked
foolish
and
sat
down
and
ingpen
quizzed
him
all
three
knew
well
that
edwin
s
fierceness
was
only
one
among
sundry
consequences
of
the
mood
of
the
housemistress
the
slow
movement
and
the
scherzo
from
the
symphony
were
played
and
while
the
music
went
on
edwin
heard
distantly
the
opening
and
shutting
of
the
and
an
arrival
in
the
hall
and
then
chattering
maggie
had
called
what
s
she
after
thought
edwin
hoo
there
s
auntie
maggie
george
exclaimed
as
soon
as
the
scherzo
was
finished
and
ran
off
that
boy
is
really
musical
said
ingpen
with
conviction
yes
i
suppose
he
is
edwin
agreed
casually
as
though
deprecating
a
talent
which
however
was
undeniable
but
you
d
never
guess
he
s
got
a
bad
headache
would
you
it
was
a
strange
kind
of
social
evening
and
hilda
it
seemed
to
the
august
edwin
had
a
strange
notion
of
the
duties
of
hostess
surely
if
tams
was
in
the
kitchen
hilda
ought
to
be
in
the
with
their
guest
surely
maggie
ought
to
have
been
brought
into
the
she
was
not
a
school
girl
she
was
a
woman
of
over
forty
and
yet
she
had
quite
inexcusably
kept
her
ancient
awkwardness
and
timidities
he
could
hear
chatterings
from
the
scurryings
through
the
hall
and
chatterings
from
the
kitchen
then
a
smash
of
crockery
a
slight
scream
and
girlish
gigglings
they
were
all
the
same
all
the
women
he
knew
except
perhaps
clara
they
had
hours
when
they
seemed
to
forget
that
they
were
adult
and
that
their
skirts
were
long
and
how
was
it
that
hilda
and
maggie
were
suddenly
so
intimate
they
whose
discreet
mutual
jealousy
was
an
undeniable
phenomenon
of
the
family
life
with
all
his
majesty
he
was
simpleton
enough
never
to
have
understood
that
two
women
who
eternally
suspect
each
other
may
yet
dissolve
upon
occasion
into
the
most
touching
playful
tenderness
the
whole
was
full
of
the
rumour
of
an
apparent
alliance
between
hilda
and
maggie
and
as
he
listened
edwin
glanced
sternly
at
the
columns
of
the
evening
while
tertius
ingpen
absorbed
worked
his
way
bravely
through
a
sonata
of
beethoven
then
george
reappeared
mother
s
going
to
take
me
to
london
about
my
eyes
said
george
to
ingpen
stopping
the
sonata
by
his
mere
sense
of
the
terrific
importance
of
such
tidings
and
he
proceeded
to
describe
the
projected
doings
in
london
the
visit
to
charlie
and
janet
orgreave
and
possibly
to
the
egyptian
hall
edwin
did
not
move
he
kept
an
admirable
and
complete
calm
under
the
blow
hilda
was
decided
then
to
defy
him
in
telling
the
boy
who
during
the
meal
had
been
permitted
to
learn
nothing
she
had
burnt
her
boats
she
had
even
burnt
edwin
s
boats
also
which
seemed
to
be
contrary
to
the
rules
laid
down
by
society
for
conjugal
warfare
but
women
never
could
fight
according
to
rules
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
great
pitched
battle
which
edwin
had
planned
for
the
close
of
the
evening
were
swiftly
multiplied
he
had
misgivings
the
chattering
giggling
girls
entered
the
but
as
maggie
came
through
the
doorway
her
face
stiffened
her
eyes
took
on
a
glaze
and
when
ingpen
bent
over
her
hand
in
all
the
false
ardour
of
his
excessive
conventional
chivalry
the
spinster
s
terrible
constraint
scourge
of
all
her
social
existence
gripped
her
like
a
disease
she
could
scarcely
speak
hello
mag
edwin
greeted
her
impossible
to
divine
in
this
plump
dowdy
fading
dumb
creature
the
participator
in
all
those
chatterings
and
gigglings
of
a
few
moments
earlier
nevertheless
edwin
who
knew
her
profoundly
could
see
beneath
the
glaze
of
those
eyes
the
commonsense
soul
of
the
sagacious
woman
protesting
against
ingpen
s
affected
manners
and
deciding
that
she
did
not
care
for
ingpen
at
all
auntie
hamps
is
being
naughty
again
said
hilda
bluntly
ingpen
and
then
edwin
sniggered
can
t
do
anything
with
her
edwin
said
maggie
speaking
quickly
and
eagerly
as
she
and
hilda
sat
down
she
s
bound
to
let
herself
in
for
another
attack
if
she
doesn
t
take
care
of
herself
and
she
won
t
take
care
of
herself
she
won
t
listen
to
the
doctor
or
anybody
else
she
s
always
on
her
feet
and
she
s
got
on
the
brain
just
now
i
ve
got
her
to
bed
early
she
s
frightfully
shaky
and
i
thought
i
d
come
up
and
tell
you
you
re
the
only
one
that
can
do
anything
with
her
at
all
and
you
really
must
come
and
see
her
on
your
way
to
the
works
maggie
spoke
as
though
she
had
been
urging
edwin
for
months
to
take
the
urgent
matter
in
hand
and
was
now
arrived
at
desperation
all
right
all
right
said
he
with
amiable
impatience
it
was
the
first
he
had
heard
of
the
matter
i
ll
drop
in
but
i
ve
got
no
influence
over
her
he
added
with
sincerity
oh
yes
you
have
said
maggie
mildly
now
i
m
very
sorry
to
hear
about
george
s
eyes
seeing
it
s
absolutely
necessary
for
hilda
to
take
him
to
london
and
you
ve
got
no
servants
at
all
can
t
you
come
and
sleep
at
auntie
s
for
a
night
or
two
you
ve
no
idea
what
a
relief
it
would
be
to
me
in
an
instant
edwin
saw
that
he
was
beaten
that
hilda
and
maggie
in
the
intervals
of
their
giggling
had
combined
to
overthrow
him
the
tone
in
which
maggie
uttered
the
words
george
s
eyes
absolutely
necessary
and
such
a
relief
precluded
argument
his
wife
would
have
her
capricious
unnecessary
way
and
he
would
be
turned
out
of
his
own
house
i
think
you
might
dear
said
hilda
with
the
angelic
persuasiveness
of
a
loving
and
submissive
wife
nobody
could
have
guessed
from
that
marvellous
tone
that
she
had
been
determined
to
defeat
him
and
was
then
so
to
speak
standing
over
his
prostrate
form
maggie
having
said
what
was
necessary
to
be
said
fell
back
into
the
constraint
from
which
no
efforts
of
her
companions
could
extricate
her
such
was
the
effect
upon
her
of
the
presence
of
tertius
ingpen
a
stranger
presently
ingpen
was
scanning
for
hilda
and
george
was
finding
notepaper
for
her
and
maggie
was
running
up
and
down
stairs
for
her
she
was
off
to
london
in
that
woman
s
head
thought
edwin
as
observing
his
wife
he
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
secrets
behind
her
demeanour
there
s
only
room
for
one
idea
at
a
time
vii
edwin
sat
alone
in
the
at
the
end
of
an
evening
which
he
declined
to
call
an
evening
at
all
his
eyes
regarded
a
book
on
his
knee
but
he
was
not
reading
it
his
mind
was
engaged
upon
the
enigma
of
his
existence
he
had
entered
his
house
without
the
least
apprehension
and
brusquely
in
a
few
hours
everything
seemed
to
be
changed
for
him
impulse
had
conquered
commonsense
his
ejectment
was
a
settled
thing
and
he
was
condemned
to
the
hated
abode
of
auntie
hamps
events
seemed
enormous
they
desolated
him
his
mouth
was
full
of
ashes
the
responsibilities
connected
with
george
were
increasing
his
wife
incalculable
and
unforeseeable
was
getting
out
of
hand
and
the
menace
of
a
future
removal
to
another
home
in
the
country
was
raised
again
he
looked
about
the
room
and
he
imagined
all
the
house
every
object
in
which
was
familiar
and
beloved
and
he
simply
could
not
bear
to
think
of
the
disintegration
of
these
interiors
by
and
of
the
endless
rasping
business
of
creating
a
new
home
in
partnership
with
a
woman
whose
ideas
about
furnishing
were
as
unsound
as
they
were
capricious
he
utterly
dismissed
the
fanciful
scheme
as
he
dismissed
the
urgings
towards
public
activity
he
deeply
resented
all
these
headstrong
intentions
to
disturb
him
in
his
tranquillity
they
were
indefensible
and
he
would
not
have
them
he
would
die
in
sullen
obstinacy
rather
than
yield
impulse
might
conquer
commonsense
but
not
beyond
a
certain
degree
he
would
never
yield
ingpen
had
departed
to
sleep
in
a
room
in
the
same
building
as
his
office
at
hanbridge
he
knew
that
ingpen
had
no
comprehension
of
domestic
comfort
and
a
day
nevertheless
he
envied
the
man
his
celestial
freedom
if
he
edwin
were
free
what
an
ideal
life
he
could
make
for
himself
a
life
presided
over
by
commonsense
regularity
and
order
he
was
not
free
he
would
never
be
free
and
what
had
he
obtained
in
exchange
for
freedom
ingpen
s
immense
criticism
smote
him
he
had
a
wife
and
her
child
servants
at
intervals
a
fine
works
and
many
workpeople
a
house
with
books
money
security
the
organised
machinery
of
his
existence
was
tremendous
and
it
was
all
due
to
him
made
by
him
in
his
own
interests
and
to
satisfy
his
own
desires
without
him
the
entire
structure
would
crumble
in
a
week
without
him
it
would
have
no
excuse
and
what
was
the
result
was
he
ever
in
any
ideal
sense
happy
that
is
free
from
foreboding
from
friction
from
responsibility
and
withal
lightly
joyous
was
any
quarter
of
an
hour
of
his
day
absolutely
what
he
would
have
wished
he
ranged
over
his
day
and
concluded
that
the
best
part
of
it
was
the
very
last
he
got
into
bed
the
candles
in
the
sconce
were
lit
the
gas
diminished
to
a
blue
speck
and
most
of
the
room
in
darkness
he
lay
down
on
his
left
side
took
the
marker
from
the
volume
in
his
hand
and
began
to
read
the
house
was
silent
and
enclosed
the
rumbling
tramcar
to
whose
sound
he
had
been
accustomed
from
infancy
did
not
a
bit
disturb
him
it
was
in
another
world
over
the
edge
of
his
book
he
could
see
the
form
of
his
wife
fast
asleep
in
the
other
bed
her
plaited
hair
trailing
over
the
pillow
the
feel
of
the
sheets
to
his
limbs
was
exquisite
he
read
the
book
was
good
the
chill
of
winter
just
pleasantly
affected
the
hand
that
held
the
book
nothing
annoyed
nothing
jarred
sleep
approached
that
fifteen
minutes
that
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
was
all
that
he
could
show
as
the
result
of
the
tremendous
organised
machinery
of
his
existence
his
house
his
works
his
workpeople
his
servants
his
wife
with
her
child
hilda
came
with
quick
determination
into
the
they
had
not
spoken
to
each
other
alone
since
the
decision
and
his
defeat
he
was
aware
of
his
heart
beating
resentfully
i
m
going
to
bed
now
dear
she
said
in
an
ordinary
tone
i
ve
got
a
frightful
headache
and
i
must
sleep
be
sure
and
wake
me
up
at
seven
in
the
morning
will
you
i
shall
have
such
lots
to
do
he
thought
has
she
a
frightful
headache
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
several
times
very
fervently
her
lips
lingered
on
his
and
all
the
time
she
frowned
ever
so
little
and
it
was
as
if
she
was
conveying
to
him
but
each
for
himself
in
marriage
after
all
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
just
a
little
relieved
and
he
could
not
understand
why
he
watched
her
as
she
left
the
room
how
had
it
come
about
that
the
still
finally
mysterious
creature
was
living
in
his
house
imposing
her
individuality
upon
him
spoiling
his
existence
he
considered
that
it
was
all
disconcertingly
strange
he
rose
lit
a
cigarette
and
opened
the
window
and
the
frosty
air
entering
braced
him
and
summoned
his
the
night
was
wondrous
and
when
he
had
shut
the
window
and
turned
again
within
the
room
beautiful
withdrawn
peaceful
was
wondrous
too
he
reflected
that
soon
he
would
be
in
bed
calmly
reading
with
his
wife
unconscious
as
an
infant
in
the
other
bed
and
then
his
grievance
against
hilda
slowly
surged
up
and
he
began
for
the
first
time
to
realise
how
vast
it
was
confound
that
woman
he
muttered
meaning
auntie
hamps
chapter
xviii
auntie
hamps
sentenced
i
on
the
next
evening
it
was
maggie
who
opened
hamps
s
for
edwin
there
was
no
light
in
the
lobby
but
a
faint
gleam
coming
through
the
open
door
of
the
disclosed
the
silhouette
of
maggie
s
broad
figure
i
thought
you
d
call
in
this
morning
said
maggie
discontentedly
i
asked
you
to
i
ve
been
expecting
you
all
day
didn
t
you
get
my
message
no
what
message
d
you
mean
to
say
a
lad
hasn
t
been
here
with
my
portmanteau
demanded
edwin
alarmed
and
ready
to
be
annoyed
yes
a
lad
s
been
with
your
portmanteau
but
he
gave
no
message
d
n
him
i
told
him
to
tell
you
i
couldn
t
possibly
get
here
before
night
well
he
didn
t
said
maggie
stoutly
throwing
back
the
blame
upon
edwin
and
his
hirelings
i
particularly
wanted
you
to
come
early
i
told
auntie
you
d
be
coming
how
s
she
getting
on
edwin
asked
with
laconic
gruffness
dismissing
maggie
s
grievance
without
an
apology
he
might
have
to
stand
nonsense
from
hilda
but
he
would
not
stand
it
from
maggie
of
whose
notorious
mildness
he
at
once
began
to
take
advantage
as
in
the
old
days
of
their
housekeeping
together
moreover
his
entrance
into
this
abode
was
a
favour
exhibiting
the
condescension
of
the
only
human
being
who
could
exercise
influence
upon
auntie
hamps
she
s
worse
said
maggie
briefly
and
significantly
in
bed
said
edwin
less
casually
marking
her
tone
maggie
nodded
had
the
doctor
i
should
think
so
indeed
hm
why
don
t
you
have
a
light
in
this
lobby
he
enquired
suddenly
on
a
drily
humorous
note
as
he
groped
to
suspend
his
overcoat
upon
an
unstable
hatstand
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
cold
lobby
after
his
own
half
she
never
will
have
a
light
here
unless
she
s
doing
the
grand
for
someone
are
you
going
to
wash
ye
no
i
cleaned
up
at
the
works
a
presentiment
of
the
damp
chilliness
of
the
hamps
bedroom
had
suggested
this
precaution
maggie
preceded
him
into
the
where
a
hexagonal
was
laid
for
tea
hello
do
you
eat
here
what
s
the
matter
with
the
the
chimney
always
smokes
when
the
wind
s
in
the
well
why
doesn
t
she
have
a
cowl
put
on
it
you
d
better
ask
her
also
she
likes
to
save
a
fire
she
can
t
bear
to
have
two
fires
going
as
well
as
the
i
ll
bring
tea
in
it
s
all
ready
maggie
went
away
edwin
looked
round
the
shabby
victorian
room
a
length
of
featureless
linoleum
led
from
the
door
to
the
table
this
linoleum
exasperated
him
it
expressed
the
very
spirit
of
his
aunt
s
house
he
glanced
at
the
pictures
the
texts
the
beady
and
the
woolly
embroideries
the
harsh
chairs
and
the
magnificent
morocco
exteriors
of
the
in
which
auntie
hamps
kept
the
shiny
portraits
of
all
her
relatives
from
back
to
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
ancestors
and
a
feeling
of
desolation
came
over
him
he
thought
how
many
days
shall
i
have
to
spend
in
this
deadly
hole
it
was
extremely
seldom
that
he
visited
king
street
and
when
he
did
come
the
house
was
brightened
to
receive
him
he
had
almost
forgotten
what
the
house
really
was
and
suddenly
thrown
back
into
it
at
its
most
lugubrious
and
ignoble
after
years
of
the
amenities
of
trafalgar
road
he
was
somehow
surprised
that
that
sort
of
thing
had
continued
to
exist
and
he
resented
that
it
should
have
dared
to
continue
to
exist
he
had
a
notion
that
since
he
had
left
it
behind
it
ought
to
have
perished
he
cautiously
lifted
the
table
and
carried
it
to
the
hearthrug
then
he
sat
down
in
the
whose
special
property
as
he
remembered
was
slowly
and
inevitably
to
slide
the
sitter
forward
to
the
hard
edge
of
the
seat
and
he
put
his
feet
inside
the
fender
in
the
grate
a
small
fire
burned
between
two
he
sneezed
maggie
came
in
with
a
tray
are
you
cold
she
asked
seeing
the
new
situation
of
the
table
am
i
cold
edwin
repeated
well
said
maggie
i
always
think
your
rooms
are
so
hot
edwin
seized
the
small
serviceable
tongs
which
saved
the
wear
of
the
large
tongs
matching
the
poker
and
the
shovel
and
he
dragged
both
firebricks
out
of
the
grate
no
coal
here
i
suppose
he
exclaimed
gloomily
opening
the
black
japanned
oh
corn
in
egypt
the
scuttle
was
full
of
coal
he
threw
on
to
the
fire
several
profuse
shovelfuls
of
best
household
nuts
which
had
cost
sixteen
shillings
a
ton
even
in
that
district
of
cheap
coal
well
maggie
murmured
aghast
it
s
a
good
thing
it
s
you
if
it
had
been
anybody
else
what
on
earth
does
she
do
with
her
money
he
muttered
shrugging
her
shoulders
maggie
went
out
again
with
an
empty
tray
no
servant
either
edwin
asked
when
she
returned
she
s
sitting
with
auntie
must
i
go
up
before
i
have
my
tea
no
she
won
t
have
heard
you
come
there
was
a
grilled
and
a
boiled
egg
on
the
crowded
small
table
with
tea
two
rounds
of
dry
bread
some
cakes
and
jam
which
are
you
having
egg
or
chop
edwin
demanded
as
maggie
sat
down
oh
they
re
both
for
you
and
what
about
you
i
only
have
as
a
rule
edwin
grunted
and
started
to
eat
what
s
supposed
to
be
the
matter
with
her
he
enquired
it
seems
it
s
congestion
of
the
lung
and
thickened
arteries
it
wouldn
t
matter
so
much
about
the
lung
being
congested
in
itself
only
it
s
the
strain
on
her
heart
i
see
been
in
bed
all
day
i
suppose
no
she
would
get
up
but
she
had
to
go
back
to
bed
at
once
she
had
a
collapse
hm
he
could
not
think
of
anything
else
to
say
haven
t
got
s
have
you
oh
no
said
maggie
astonished
at
such
a
strange
demand
hilda
get
off
all
right
yes
they
went
by
the
nine
train
she
told
me
that
she
should
if
she
could
manage
it
i
expect
tams
was
up
there
early
edwin
nodded
recalling
with
bitterness
certain
moments
of
the
early
morning
and
then
silence
ensued
the
brother
and
sister
could
not
keep
the
conversation
alive
edwin
thought
we
know
each
other
intimately
and
we
respect
each
other
and
yet
we
can
not
even
conduct
a
meal
together
without
awkwardness
and
constraint
has
civilisation
down
here
got
no
further
than
that
he
felt
sorry
for
maggie
and
also
kindly
disdainful
of
her
he
glanced
at
her
furtively
and
tried
to
see
in
her
the
girl
of
the
far
past
she
had
grown
immensely
older
than
himself
she
was
now
at
home
in
the
dreadful
hamps
environment
true
she
had
an
income
but
had
she
any
pleasures
it
was
impossible
to
divine
what
her
pleasures
might
be
what
she
thought
about
when
she
lay
in
bed
to
what
hours
she
looked
forward
first
his
father
then
himself
and
lastly
auntie
hamps
had
subjugated
her
and
of
the
three
auntie
hamps
had
most
ruthlessly
succeeded
and
in
the
shortest
time
and
yet
edwin
felt
even
auntie
hamps
had
not
quite
succeeded
and
the
original
individual
still
survived
in
maggie
and
was
silently
critical
of
all
the
phenomena
which
surrounded
her
and
to
which
she
had
apparently
submitted
realising
this
edwin
ceased
to
be
kindly
disdainful
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
a
heavy
foot
was
heard
on
the
stairs
minnie
maggie
called
after
shuffling
and
hesitation
the
door
was
pushed
ever
so
little
open
yes
miss
said
someone
feebly
why
have
you
left
hamps
do
you
need
anything
missis
made
me
go
miss
came
the
reply
very
loosely
articulated
come
in
and
take
your
bread
said
maggie
and
aside
to
edwin
auntie
s
at
it
again
after
another
hesitation
the
door
opened
wide
and
minnie
became
visible
she
was
rather
a
big
girl
quite
young
fat
too
fair
undecided
obviously
always
between
two
minds
her
large
apron
over
the
blue
frock
was
of
a
dubious
yellow
colour
she
wore
spectacles
behind
her
spectacles
she
seemed
to
be
blinking
in
confusion
at
all
the
subtle
complexities
of
existence
she
advanced
irregularly
to
the
table
with
a
sort
of
nervous
desperation
as
if
saying
i
have
to
go
through
this
ordeal
edwin
could
not
judge
whether
she
was
about
to
smile
or
about
to
weep
here
s
your
bread
said
maggie
indicating
the
two
rounds
of
dry
bread
i
ve
left
the
dripping
on
the
kitchen
table
for
you
edwin
revolted
perceived
of
course
in
a
flash
what
the
life
of
minnie
was
under
the
regime
of
auntie
hamps
thank
ye
miss
he
noticed
that
the
veiled
voice
was
that
of
a
rather
deaf
person
blushing
minnie
took
the
bread
and
moved
away
just
as
she
reached
the
door
she
gave
a
great
sob
followed
by
a
number
of
little
ones
and
the
bread
fell
on
to
the
carpet
she
left
it
there
and
vanished
still
violently
sobbing
edwin
spellbound
stopped
masticating
a
momentary
sensation
almost
of
horror
seized
him
maggie
turned
pale
and
he
was
glad
that
she
turned
pale
if
she
had
shown
by
no
sign
that
such
happenings
were
unusual
he
would
have
been
afraid
of
the
very
house
itself
of
its
mere
sinister
walls
which
seemed
to
shelter
sick
tyrants
miserable
victims
and
enchanted
captives
he
would
have
begun
to
wonder
whether
he
himself
was
safe
in
it
what
next
muttered
maggie
intimidated
but
plucky
rising
and
following
minnie
just
go
up
to
auntie
will
you
she
called
to
edwin
over
her
shoulder
she
oughtn
t
really
to
be
left
alone
for
a
minute
ii
edwin
pushed
open
the
door
and
crept
with
precautions
into
the
bedroom
hamps
was
dozing
in
the
of
the
lowered
gas
he
looked
at
her
and
was
alarmed
shocked
for
it
was
at
once
apparent
that
she
must
be
very
she
lay
reclining
against
several
crumpled
and
crushed
pillows
with
her
head
on
one
side
and
her
veined
hands
limp
on
the
eiderdown
between
the
heavy
brown
that
hung
from
the
carved
mahogany
tester
the
posture
seemed
to
be
that
of
an
exhausted
animal
surprised
by
the
unconsciousness
of
final
fatigue
shameless
in
the
intense
need
of
repose
auntie
hamps
had
ceased
to
be
a
wesleyan
a
pillar
of
society
a
champion
of
the
conventions
and
a
of
appearances
she
was
just
an
utterly
wearied
and
beaten
creature
breathing
noisily
through
mouth
edwin
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
her
when
she
was
not
to
some
extent
arrayed
for
the
world
s
gaze
he
had
not
seen
her
at
the
crisis
of
any
of
her
recent
attacks
he
knew
that
more
than
once
she
had
recovered
when
good
judges
had
pronounced
recovery
impossible
but
he
was
quite
sure
now
that
she
would
never
rise
from
that
bed
he
had
the
sudden
dreadful
thought
she
is
done
for
sentenced
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
us
this
is
the
end
for
her
she
won
t
be
able
to
pretend
any
more
all
her
efforts
have
come
to
this
the
thought
affected
him
like
a
blow
and
two
somewhat
contradictory
ideas
sprang
from
it
first
the
entire
absurdity
of
her
career
as
revealed
by
its
close
and
secondly
the
tragic
dignity
with
which
its
close
was
endowing
her
at
once
contemptible
and
august
she
was
diminished
even
in
size
her
scanty
grey
hair
was
tousled
her
pink
flannel
with
its
long
loose
sleeves
was
grotesque
the
multitude
of
her
patched
outer
wrappings
from
which
peeped
her
head
on
its
withered
neck
and
and
the
orifice
of
a
bag
were
equally
grotesque
none
of
the
was
clean
or
of
good
quality
the
eiderdown
was
old
and
the
of
its
small
white
feathers
were
piercing
it
the
table
at
the
had
a
strange
collection
of
poor
odd
crockery
the
whole
room
with
its
distempered
walls
of
an
uncomfortable
green
colour
in
spite
of
several
respectable
pieces
of
mahogany
furniture
seemed
to
be
the
secret
retreat
of
a
graceless
and
mean
indigence
and
above
all
it
was
damply
cold
the
window
stood
a
little
open
and
only
the
tiniest
fire
burnt
in
the
inefficient
grate
for
decades
auntie
hamps
with
her
erect
figure
and
handsome
face
her
black
silks
jet
ornaments
and
sealskins
her
small
regular
subscriptions
and
her
spasmodic
splendours
of
golden
generosity
her
heroic
relentless
hypocrisies
and
her
absolute
and
independence
had
exhibited
a
glorious
front
to
the
world
with
her
person
and
individuality
were
almost
everything
and
the
environment
she
had
made
for
herself
almost
nothing
the
of
her
house
was
presentable
especially
when
titivated
for
occasional
hospitalities
but
not
more
than
presentable
the
upper
floor
was
never
shown
in
particular
auntie
hamps
was
not
one
of
those
women
who
invite
other
women
to
their
bedrooms
her
bedroom
was
guarded
like
a
fastness
in
it
unbeheld
lived
the
other
auntie
hamps
complementary
to
the
grand
and
massive
hamps
known
to
mankind
and
now
the
fastness
was
exposed
defenceless
and
its
squalid
avaricious
secrets
discovered
and
she
was
too
broken
to
protest
there
was
something
unbearably
pitiful
in
that
her
pose
was
pitiful
and
her
face
was
pitiful
those
features
were
still
far
from
ugly
the
contours
of
the
flushed
cheeks
the
chin
and
the
convex
eyelids
were
astonishingly
soft
and
recalled
the
young
girl
of
about
half
a
century
earlier
she
was
both
old
and
young
in
her
troubled
unconsciousness
the
reflection
was
inevitable
she
was
a
young
girl
and
now
she
is
sentenced
edwin
felt
himself
desolated
by
a
terrible
gloom
which
questioned
the
justification
of
all
life
the
cold
of
the
room
made
him
shiver
after
gazing
for
a
long
time
at
the
sufferer
he
tiptoed
to
the
fire
on
the
painted
iron
mantelpiece
were
a
basalt
clock
and
three
photographs
a
recent
photograph
of
smirking
clara
surrounded
by
her
brood
a
faded
photograph
of
maggie
as
a
young
girl
intolerably
dowdy
and
an
equally
faded
photograph
of
himself
as
a
young
man
of
twenty
he
remembered
the
suit
and
the
necktie
in
which
he
had
been
photographed
the
simplicity
the
ingenuousness
of
his
own
boyish
face
moved
him
deeply
and
at
the
same
time
disgusted
him
was
i
like
that
he
thought
astounded
and
he
felt
intensely
sorry
for
the
raw
youth
above
the
clock
was
suspended
by
a
ribbon
a
new
green
card
lettered
in
silver
with
some
verses
entitled
lean
hard
this
card
he
knew
had
superseded
a
booklet
of
similar
tenor
that
used
to
lie
on
the
when
he
was
an
infant
the
verses
began
of
my
love
lean
hard
let
me
feel
the
pressure
of
thy
and
they
ended
lovest
me
i
knew
it
doubt
not
then
loving
me
lean
all
his
life
he
had
laughed
at
the
notion
of
his
auntie
leaning
hard
upon
anything
whatever
yet
she
had
lived
continually
with
these
verses
ever
since
the
year
of
their
first
publication
she
had
never
tired
of
their
message
and
now
edwin
was
touched
he
seemed
to
see
some
sincerity
some
beauty
in
them
he
had
a
vision
of
their
author
unknown
to
literature
but
honoured
in
a
hundred
thousand
respectable
homes
he
thought
did
auntie
only
pretend
to
believe
in
them
or
did
she
think
she
did
believe
in
them
or
did
she
really
believe
in
them
the
last
seemed
a
possibility
supposing
she
did
really
believe
in
them
yes
he
was
touched
he
was
ready
to
admit
that
spirituality
was
denied
to
none
he
seemed
to
come
into
contact
with
the
universal
immanent
spirituality
then
he
stooped
to
put
some
bits
of
coal
silently
on
the
fire
who
s
that
putting
coal
on
the
fire
said
a
faint
but
sharply
protesting
voice
from
the
bed
the
weakness
of
the
voice
gave
edwin
a
fresh
shock
the
voice
seemed
to
be
drawing
on
the
very
last
reserves
of
its
owner
s
vitality
owing
to
the
height
of
the
foot
of
the
bed
auntie
hamps
could
not
see
anything
at
the
fireplace
lower
than
the
mantelpiece
as
she
withdrew
from
earth
she
employed
her
fading
faculties
to
expostulate
against
a
waste
of
coal
and
to
identify
the
unseen
criminal
i
am
said
edwin
cheerfully
it
was
nearly
out
he
stood
up
smiling
slightly
and
faced
her
auntie
hamps
lifting
her
head
and
frowning
in
surprise
gazed
at
him
for
a
few
moments
as
if
trying
to
decide
who
he
was
then
she
said
in
the
same
enfeebled
tone
as
before
eh
edwin
i
never
heard
you
come
in
this
is
an
honour
and
her
head
dropped
back
i
m
sleeping
here
said
edwin
with
determined
cheerfulness
did
ye
know
she
reflected
and
answered
deliberately
using
her
volition
to
articulate
every
syllable
yes
ye
re
having
maggie
s
room
oh
no
auntie
yes
you
are
i
ve
told
her
the
faint
voice
became
harshly
obstinate
turn
the
gas
up
a
bit
edwin
so
that
i
can
see
you
well
this
is
an
honour
did
maggie
give
ye
a
proper
tea
oh
yes
thanks
splendid
he
raised
the
gas
auntie
hamps
blinked
you
want
something
to
shade
this
gas
said
edwin
i
ll
fix
ye
something
the
was
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
over
the
and
nearly
opposite
the
bed
auntie
hamps
nodded
having
glanced
about
edwin
put
a
on
the
and
on
that
upright
and
open
the
hamps
family
bible
from
the
ottoman
the
infirm
creation
was
just
lofty
enough
to
come
between
the
light
and
the
old
woman
s
eyes
that
ll
be
better
said
he
you
re
not
at
all
well
i
hear
auntie
he
endeavoured
to
be
tactful
she
slowly
shook
her
head
as
it
lay
on
the
pillow
this
is
one
of
my
bad
days
but
i
shall
pick
up
then
has
hilda
taken
george
to
london
edwin
nodded
eh
i
do
hope
and
pray
it
ll
be
all
right
i
ve
had
such
good
eyesight
myself
i
m
all
the
more
afraid
for
others
what
a
blessing
it
s
been
to
me
eh
what
a
good
mother
dear
hilda
is
she
added
after
a
pause
i
daresay
there
never
was
such
a
mother
as
hilda
unless
it
s
clara
has
clara
been
in
edwin
demanded
to
change
the
subject
of
conversation
no
she
hasn
t
but
she
will
as
soon
as
she
has
a
moment
she
ll
be
popping
in
they
re
such
a
tie
on
her
those
children
are
and
how
she
looks
after
them
edwin
she
called
him
as
though
he
were
receding
yes
the
frail
voice
continued
articulating
with
great
carefulness
and
achieving
each
sentence
as
though
it
were
a
miracle
as
indeed
it
was
i
think
no
one
ever
had
such
nephews
and
nieces
as
i
have
i
ve
never
had
children
of
my
own
that
was
not
to
be
but
i
must
say
the
lord
has
made
it
up
to
me
in
my
nephews
and
nieces
you
and
hilda
and
clara
and
albert
and
the
little
chicks
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
you
re
forgetting
maggie
said
edwin
lightly
yes
auntie
hamps
agreed
but
in
a
quite
different
tone
reluctant
and
critical
i
m
sure
maggie
does
her
best
oh
i
m
sure
she
does
edwin
again
she
called
him
he
approached
the
tumbled
bed
and
even
sat
on
the
edge
of
it
his
hands
in
his
pockets
auntie
hamps
though
breathing
now
more
rapidly
and
with
more
difficulty
seemed
to
have
revitalised
herself
at
some
mysterious
source
of
energy
she
was
still
preoccupied
by
the
mental
concentration
and
the
effort
of
volition
required
for
the
smallest
physical
acts
incident
to
her
continued
existence
but
she
had
accumulated
power
for
the
furtherance
of
greater
ends
d
ye
want
anything
edwin
suggested
indicating
the
contents
of
the
she
moved
her
head
to
signify
a
negative
her
arms
did
not
stir
and
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
suspended
while
she
prepared
for
an
exertion
i
m
so
relieved
you
ve
come
she
said
at
length
slowly
and
painfully
you
can
t
think
what
a
relief
it
is
to
me
i
ve
really
no
one
but
you
it
s
about
that
girl
what
girl
minnie
the
servant
hamps
inclined
her
head
and
fetched
breath
through
the
mouth
i
ve
only
just
found
it
out
she
s
in
trouble
oh
she
admitted
it
to
me
a
bit
ago
i
sent
her
downstairs
i
wouldn
t
have
her
in
my
bedroom
a
minute
longer
she
s
in
trouble
i
felt
sure
she
was
she
was
at
last
wednesday
and
only
yesterday
i
paid
her
her
wages
only
yesterday
here
she
lives
on
the
fat
of
the
land
and
what
does
she
do
for
it
i
assure
you
i
have
to
see
to
everything
myself
i
m
always
after
her
in
a
month
she
won
t
be
fit
to
be
seen
edwin
i
ve
never
been
so
ashamed
that
i
should
have
to
tell
such
a
thing
to
my
own
nephew
she
ceased
exhausted
edwin
was
somewhat
amused
he
could
not
help
feeling
amused
at
such
an
accident
happening
in
the
house
of
hamps
who
s
the
man
he
asked
yes
and
that
s
another
thing
answered
hamps
solemnly
in
her
extreme
weakness
it
s
the
barman
at
the
vaults
of
all
people
she
wouldn
t
admit
it
but
i
know
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
must
leave
my
house
at
once
where
does
she
live
i
mean
her
people
she
has
no
parents
auntie
hamps
reflected
for
a
few
moments
she
has
an
aunt
at
axe
well
she
can
t
get
to
axe
said
edwin
positively
does
maggie
know
about
it
maggie
exclaimed
hamps
scornfully
maggie
never
notices
she
added
in
a
graver
tone
and
there
s
no
reason
why
maggie
should
know
it
s
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
maggie
ought
to
know
about
you
can
speak
to
the
girl
herself
it
will
come
much
better
from
you
i
shall
simply
tell
maggie
i
ve
decided
the
girl
must
go
she
can
t
go
edwin
repeated
humouringly
but
firmly
auntie
hamps
proved
the
sincerity
of
her
regard
for
him
by
yielding
well
she
murmured
morning
then
she
can
turn
out
the
and
clean
the
silver
in
the
black
box
and
then
she
can
go
before
dinner
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
give
her
her
dinner
nor
her
extra
day
s
wages
either
and
what
shall
you
do
for
a
servant
get
a
charwoman
charwoman
no
maggie
will
manage
and
then
with
a
sudden
flare
of
relished
violence
i
always
knew
that
girl
was
a
mopsy
slut
and
what
s
more
if
you
ask
me
she
brought
him
into
the
house
and
after
eleven
o
clock
at
night
too
all
right
edwin
muttered
to
soothe
the
patient
and
hamps
sadly
smiled
it
s
such
a
relief
to
me
she
breathed
you
don
t
know
what
a
relief
to
me
it
is
to
put
it
in
your
hands
her
eyelids
dropped
she
said
no
more
having
looked
back
for
an
instant
in
a
supreme
effort
on
behalf
of
the
conventions
upon
which
society
was
established
auntie
hamps
turned
again
exhausted
towards
the
lifting
veil
of
the
unknown
and
edwin
began
to
realise
the
significance
of
the
scene
that
was
ended
iii
i
say
edwin
began
when
he
had
silently
closed
the
door
of
the
here
s
a
lark
if
you
like
and
he
gave
a
short
laugh
it
was
under
such
language
and
such
demeanour
that
he
concealed
his
real
emotion
which
was
partly
solemn
partly
pleasurable
and
wholly
buoyant
maggie
looked
up
gloomily
with
a
bit
of
pencil
held
very
close
to
the
point
in
her
heavy
fingers
she
was
totting
up
the
figures
of
household
accounts
in
a
penny
edwin
went
on
it
seems
the
girl
yon
he
indicated
the
kitchen
with
a
jerk
of
the
head
s
been
and
got
herself
into
a
mess
maggie
leaned
her
chin
on
her
hand
has
she
been
talking
to
you
about
it
with
a
similar
jerk
of
the
head
maggie
indicated
hamps
s
bedroom
yes
i
suppose
she
s
only
just
found
it
out
who
auntie
yes
did
you
know
about
it
did
i
know
about
it
maggie
repeated
with
mild
disdainful
impatience
of
course
i
knew
about
it
i
ve
known
for
weeks
but
i
wasn
t
going
to
tell
she
finished
bitterly
edwin
regarded
his
sister
with
new
respect
and
not
without
astonishment
never
before
in
their
lives
had
they
discussed
any
inconvenient
sexual
phenomenon
save
for
vague
and
very
careful
occasional
reference
to
clara
s
motherhood
maggie
had
never
given
any
evidence
to
her
brother
that
she
was
acquainted
with
what
are
called
in
countries
the
facts
of
life
and
he
had
somehow
thought
of
her
as
not
having
emerged
at
the
age
of
or
so
from
the
naïve
ignorance
of
the
young
girl
now
her
perfectly
phlegmatic
attitude
in
front
of
the
minnie
episode
seemed
to
betoken
a
familiarity
that
approached
cynicism
and
she
was
not
at
all
she
was
at
her
ease
she
had
become
a
woman
of
the
world
edwin
liked
her
he
liked
her
manner
and
her
tone
his
interest
in
the
episode
even
increased
she
was
for
turning
her
out
said
he
i
stopped
that
i
should
think
so
indeed
i
ve
got
her
as
far
as
morning
the
girl
won
t
go
morning
either
said
maggie
at
least
if
she
goes
i
go
she
spoke
with
tranquillity
adding
but
we
needn
t
bother
about
that
auntie
ll
be
past
worrying
about
minnie
morning
i
d
better
go
up
to
her
she
can
t
possibly
be
left
alone
maggie
shut
the
and
rose
i
only
came
down
for
a
sec
to
tell
you
she
was
dozing
said
edwin
apologetically
she
s
awfully
i
d
no
idea
yes
she
s
ill
right
enough
who
ll
sit
up
with
her
i
shall
did
you
sit
up
with
her
last
night
no
only
part
of
the
night
we
ought
to
get
a
nurse
well
we
can
t
get
one
and
what
about
clara
can
t
she
take
a
turn
surely
in
a
case
like
this
she
can
chuck
her
eternal
kids
for
a
bit
i
expect
she
could
but
she
doesn
t
know
haven
t
you
sent
round
expressed
surprise
i
couldn
t
said
maggie
with
undisturbed
equanimity
who
could
i
send
i
couldn
t
spare
minnie
the
thing
didn
t
seem
at
all
serious
until
this
morning
since
then
i
ve
had
my
hands
full
yes
i
can
see
you
have
edwin
agreed
appreciatively
it
was
lucky
the
doctor
called
on
his
own
he
does
sometimes
you
know
since
she
began
to
have
her
attacks
well
i
ll
go
round
to
clara
s
myself
said
edwin
i
shouldn
t
said
maggie
at
least
not
why
not
he
might
have
put
the
question
angrily
overbearingly
but
maggie
was
so
friendly
suave
confidential
persuasive
and
so
sure
of
herself
that
with
pleasure
he
copied
her
accents
he
enjoyed
thus
talking
to
her
intimately
in
the
ugly
dark
house
with
the
foolish
minnie
on
the
one
hand
and
the
dying
old
woman
on
the
other
he
thought
there
s
something
splendid
about
mag
in
fact
i
always
knew
there
was
and
he
forgot
her
terrible
social
shortcomings
her
utter
lack
of
the
feminine
seductiveness
that
for
him
ought
to
be
in
every
woman
and
her
invincible
stolidity
her
sturdy
and
yet
scarcely
articulate
championship
of
minnie
delighted
him
and
quickened
his
pulse
i
d
sooner
not
have
her
here
said
maggie
you
knew
they
d
had
a
tremendous
rumpus
didn
t
you
who
auntie
and
clara
yes
i
didn
t
what
about
when
nobody
ever
said
anything
to
me
oh
it
must
have
been
two
or
three
months
ago
auntie
said
something
about
albert
not
paying
me
my
interest
on
my
money
he
s
got
and
then
clara
flared
up
and
the
fat
was
in
the
fire
d
you
mean
to
say
he
s
not
paying
you
your
interest
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
i
didn
t
want
to
bother
you
well
you
ought
to
have
bothered
me
said
edwin
with
a
trace
of
benevolent
severity
he
was
astounded
and
somewhat
hurt
that
this
great
family
event
should
have
been
successfully
concealed
from
him
he
felt
furious
against
albert
and
clara
and
at
the
same
time
proud
that
his
prognostication
about
the
investment
with
albert
had
proved
correct
did
hilda
know
oh
yes
hilda
knew
well
i
m
dashed
the
exclamation
showed
naïvete
his
impression
of
the
chicanery
of
women
was
deepened
so
that
it
actually
disquieted
him
but
i
suppose
he
went
on
i
suppose
this
row
isn
t
going
to
stop
clara
from
coming
here
seeing
the
state
auntie
s
in
no
certainly
not
clara
would
come
like
a
shot
if
she
knew
and
albert
as
well
she
s
a
good
nurse
in
some
ways
well
if
they
aren
t
told
and
anything
happens
to
auntie
in
the
night
there
ll
be
a
fine
afterwards
don
t
forget
that
nothing
ll
happen
to
auntie
in
the
night
said
maggie
with
tranquil
reassurance
and
i
don
t
think
i
could
stand
em
the
hint
of
her
nervous
susceptibility
beneath
that
stolid
exterior
appealed
to
him
maggie
since
closing
the
had
moved
foot
by
foot
anxiously
towards
the
door
and
had
only
been
kept
in
the
room
by
the
imperative
urgency
of
the
conversation
she
now
had
her
hand
on
the
door
i
say
he
held
her
yet
another
moment
what
s
this
about
me
taking
your
room
i
don
t
want
to
turn
you
out
of
your
room
that
s
all
right
she
said
with
a
kind
smile
it
s
easiest
really
moreover
i
daresay
there
won
t
be
such
a
lot
of
sleeping
i
must
go
up
at
once
she
can
t
possibly
be
left
alone
maggie
opened
the
door
and
she
had
scarcely
stepped
forth
when
minnie
from
the
kitchen
rushed
into
the
lobby
and
dropped
intentionally
or
unintentionally
on
her
knees
before
her
edwin
unobserved
by
minnie
witnessed
the
scene
through
the
doorway
minnie
agitated
almost
to
the
point
of
hysteria
was
crying
violently
and
as
she
breathed
her
shoulders
lifted
and
fell
and
the
sound
of
her
sobbing
rose
periodically
to
a
shriek
and
sank
to
a
groan
she
knelt
with
her
body
and
thighs
upright
and
her
head
erect
making
no
attempt
to
stem
the
tears
or
to
hide
her
face
in
her
extreme
desolation
she
was
perhaps
as
unconscious
of
herself
as
she
had
ever
been
her
cap
was
awry
on
her
head
and
her
hair
disarranged
the
blinking
spectacles
made
her
ridiculous
only
the
blue
print
uniform
and
the
sinister
yellowish
apron
drawn
down
tight
under
her
knees
gave
a
certain
respectable
regularity
to
her
extraordinary
and
grotesque
appearance
to
edwin
she
seemed
excessively
young
and
yet
far
too
large
and
too
developed
for
her
age
the
girl
was
obviously
a
fool
edwin
could
perceive
in
her
no
charm
whatever
except
that
of
her
innocence
and
it
was
not
easy
to
imagine
that
any
man
even
the
barman
at
the
vaults
could
have
mistaken
her
even
momentarily
for
the
ideal
and
then
some
glance
of
her
spectacled
eyes
or
some
gesture
of
the
great
red
hand
showed
him
his
own
blindness
and
mysteriously
made
him
realise
the
immensity
of
the
illusion
and
the
disillusion
through
which
she
had
passed
in
her
foolish
and
incontinent
simplicity
what
had
happened
to
her
was
miraculous
exquisite
and
terrible
he
felt
the
magic
of
her
illusion
and
the
terror
of
her
disillusion
already
in
her
girlishness
and
her
stupidity
she
had
lived
through
supreme
hours
compared
to
her
he
thought
i
don
t
know
what
life
is
no
man
does
and
he
not
only
suffered
for
her
sorrow
he
gave
her
a
sacred
quality
it
seemed
to
him
that
heaven
itself
ought
to
endow
her
with
beauty
grace
and
wisdom
so
that
she
might
meet
with
triumphant
dignity
the
ordeals
that
awaited
her
and
that
mankind
should
supplement
the
work
of
heaven
by
clothing
her
richly
and
housing
her
in
secluded
splendour
and
offering
her
the
service
which
only
victims
merit
surely
her
caprices
ought
to
be
indulged
and
honoured
edwin
was
indignant
indignation
positively
burnt
his
body
she
was
helpless
and
defenceless
and
she
had
been
exploited
by
auntie
hamps
and
after
having
been
exploited
she
had
been
driven
out
by
ukase
on
to
and
on
sunday
night
to
chapel
to
find
christ
with
the
result
that
she
had
found
the
barman
at
the
vaults
the
consequences
were
inevitable
she
was
definitely
ruined
unless
the
child
should
bereave
her
by
dying
and
even
then
she
might
still
be
ruined
and
what
about
the
child
if
the
child
lived
and
although
edwin
had
never
seen
the
silly
girl
before
he
said
to
himself
while
noticing
that
a
crumb
or
two
of
the
bread
dropped
by
her
still
remained
on
the
floor
i
ll
see
that
girl
through
whatever
it
costs
he
was
not
indignant
against
auntie
hamps
how
could
he
be
indignant
against
an
expiring
old
creature
already
desperate
in
the
final
dilemma
he
felt
nearly
as
sorry
for
auntie
hamps
as
for
minnie
he
was
indignant
against
destiny
of
which
auntie
hamps
was
only
the
miserable
unimaginative
instrument
i
d
better
go
miss
let
me
go
cried
minnie
and
she
cried
so
loudly
that
edwin
was
afraid
auntie
hamps
might
hear
and
might
make
an
apparition
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
curse
minnie
with
fearful
biblical
names
and
the
old
woman
in
the
curtained
bed
upstairs
was
almost
as
present
to
him
as
the
girl
kneeling
before
his
eyes
on
the
linoleum
of
the
lobby
minnie
minnie
don
t
be
foolish
said
maggie
standing
over
her
and
soothing
her
not
with
her
hands
but
with
her
voice
maggie
had
shown
no
perturbation
or
even
surprise
at
minnie
s
behaviour
she
stood
looking
down
at
her
benevolent
deprecating
and
calm
and
by
contrast
with
minnie
she
seemed
to
be
quite
her
tone
was
exactly
right
it
reminded
edwin
of
the
tone
which
she
would
use
to
himself
when
she
was
sixteen
and
the
housekeeper
and
he
was
twelve
maggie
had
long
since
lost
authority
over
him
she
had
lost
everything
she
would
die
without
having
lived
she
had
never
begun
to
live
no
perhaps
once
she
had
just
begun
to
live
minnie
had
prime
knowledge
far
exceeding
hers
and
yet
she
had
power
over
minnie
and
could
exercise
it
with
skill
minnie
hesitating
sobbed
more
slowly
and
then
ceased
to
sob
go
back
into
the
kitchen
and
have
something
to
eat
and
then
you
can
go
to
bed
you
ll
feel
differently
in
the
morning
said
maggie
with
the
same
gentle
blandness
and
minnie
as
though
fascinated
rose
from
her
knees
edwin
surmising
what
had
passed
between
the
two
in
the
kitchen
while
he
was
in
the
bedroom
was
aware
of
a
fresh
intense
admiration
for
maggie
she
might
be
dowdy
narrow
dull
obstinate
virgin
but
she
was
superb
she
had
terrific
reserves
he
was
proud
of
her
the
tone
merely
of
her
voice
as
she
spoke
to
the
girl
seemed
to
prove
the
greatness
of
her
soul
suddenly
minnie
caught
sight
of
edwin
through
the
doorway
flushed
red
had
the
air
of
slavishly
apologising
to
the
unapproachable
male
for
having
disturbed
him
by
her
and
vanished
maggie
hurried
upstairs
to
the
departing
edwin
was
alone
with
the
chill
draught
from
the
lobby
into
the
room
and
with
the
wonder
of
life
iv
in
the
middle
of
the
night
edwin
kept
watch
over
auntie
hamps
who
was
asleep
he
sat
in
a
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
the
right
side
of
his
face
to
the
glow
of
the
fire
the
fire
was
as
effective
as
the
size
and
form
of
the
grate
would
allow
it
burnt
richly
red
but
its
influence
did
not
seem
to
extend
beyond
a
radius
of
four
feet
outwards
from
its
centre
the
terrible
damp
chill
of
the
five
towns
winter
hung
in
the
bedroom
like
an
invisible
miasma
he
could
feel
the
cold
from
the
window
which
was
nevertheless
shut
through
the
shawl
with
which
he
had
closed
the
interstices
of
the
back
of
the
chair
and
though
he
had
another
thick
shawl
over
his
knees
the
whole
of
his
left
side
felt
the
creeping
attack
of
the
insidious
miasma
a
thermometer
which
he
had
found
and
which
lay
on
the
five
yards
from
the
fire
registered
only
degrees
his
expelled
breath
showed
in
the
air
it
was
as
if
he
were
fighting
with
all
resources
against
frigidity
and
barely
holding
his
own
in
the
of
the
gas
still
screened
from
the
bed
by
the
and
the
bible
he
glanced
round
amid
the
dark
meadows
at
the
mean
and
sinister
ugliness
of
the
historic
chamber
the
secret
nest
and
withdrawing
place
of
auntie
hamps
and
the
real
asceticism
of
her
life
and
of
the
life
of
all
her
generation
almost
smote
him
half
a
century
earlier
such
a
room
had
represented
comfort
in
some
details
as
for
instance
in
its
bed
it
represented
luxury
and
in
half
a
century
auntie
hamps
had
learnt
nothing
from
the
material
progress
of
civilisation
but
the
use
of
the
bag
her
vanished
and
forgotten
parents
would
have
looked
askance
at
the
enervating
luxuriousness
of
her
bag
unknown
even
to
the
crude
wistful
boy
edwin
on
the
mantelpiece
and
auntie
hamps
herself
was
wont
as
it
were
to
atone
for
it
by
using
the
still
tepid
water
therefrom
for
her
morning
toilet
instead
of
having
truly
hot
water
brought
up
from
the
kitchen
edwin
thought
are
we
happier
for
these
changes
brought
about
by
the
mysterious
force
of
evolution
and
answered
very
emphatically
yes
we
are
he
would
not
for
anything
have
gone
back
to
the
austerities
of
his
boyhood
he
rocked
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
chair
excited
by
events
and
by
the
novel
situation
and
he
was
not
dissatisfied
with
himself
indeed
he
was
aware
of
a
certain
calm
complacency
for
his
commonsense
had
triumphed
over
maggie
s
devoted
silly
womanishness
maggie
was
for
sitting
up
through
the
night
she
was
anxious
to
wear
herself
out
for
no
reason
whatever
but
he
had
sent
her
to
bed
until
three
o
clock
promising
to
call
her
if
she
should
be
needed
the
exhausted
girl
was
full
of
sagacity
save
on
that
one
point
of
martyrdom
to
the
fullest
apparently
with
her
a
point
of
honour
for
the
sake
of
the
sensation
of
having
martyrised
herself
utterly
she
was
ready
to
imperil
her
fitness
for
the
morrow
she
secretly
thought
it
was
unfair
to
call
upon
him
a
man
to
share
her
fatigues
he
regarded
himself
as
her
superior
in
wisdom
and
he
was
relieved
that
anyone
so
wise
and
balanced
as
edwin
clayhanger
had
taken
supreme
charge
of
the
household
organism
restless
he
got
up
from
the
chair
and
looked
at
the
bed
he
had
heard
no
unusual
sound
therefrom
but
to
excuse
his
restlessness
he
had
said
suppose
some
change
had
occurred
and
i
didn
t
notice
it
no
change
had
occurred
auntie
hamps
lay
like
a
mite
like
a
baby
forlorn
senile
and
defenceless
amid
the
heaped
pillows
and
coverings
of
the
bed
within
the
deep
gloom
of
the
canopy
and
the
curtains
only
her
small
soft
face
was
alive
even
her
hair
was
hidden
in
the
indentation
made
by
the
weight
of
her
head
in
the
pillows
she
was
unconscious
either
in
sleep
or
otherwise
he
could
not
tell
how
and
in
her
unconsciousness
the
losing
but
obstinate
fight
against
the
power
which
was
dragging
her
over
the
edge
of
eternity
still
went
on
it
showed
in
the
apprehensive
character
of
her
breathing
which
made
a
little
momentary
periodic
cloud
above
her
face
and
in
the
uneasy
muscular
movements
of
the
lips
and
jaws
and
in
the
vague
noises
in
her
throat
a
tremendous
pity
for
her
his
heart
almost
breaking
it
because
she
was
so
beaten
and
so
fallen
from
the
gorgeousness
of
her
splendour
even
minnie
could
have
imposed
her
will
upon
auntie
hamps
now
each
hour
she
weakened
he
had
no
more
resentment
against
her
on
account
of
minnie
no
accusation
to
formulate
he
was
merely
grieved
with
a
compassionate
grief
that
auntie
hamps
had
learnt
so
little
while
living
so
long
he
knew
that
she
was
cruel
only
because
she
was
incapable
of
imagining
what
it
was
to
be
minnie
he
understood
she
worshipped
god
under
the
form
of
respectability
but
she
did
worship
god
like
all
religious
votaries
she
placed
religion
above
morality
hence
her
chicane
her
inveterate
deceit
and
it
was
with
a
religious
aim
that
she
had
concealed
from
him
the
estrangement
between
herself
and
clara
the
unity
of
the
family
was
one
of
her
major
canons
as
indeed
it
was
one
of
edwin
s
she
had
a
passion
for
her
nephew
and
nieces
it
was
a
grand
passion
her
pride
in
them
must
have
been
as
terrific
as
her
longing
that
they
and
all
theirs
should
conform
to
the
sole
ideal
that
she
comprehended
undeniably
there
was
something
magnificent
in
her
religion
her
unscrupulousness
in
the
practice
of
it
and
the
mighty
consistency
of
her
career
she
had
lived
he
ceased
to
pity
her
for
she
towered
above
pity
she
was
dying
but
only
for
an
instant
he
would
smile
at
his
aunt
s
primeval
notions
of
a
future
life
yet
he
had
to
admit
that
his
own
notions
though
far
less
precise
could
not
be
appreciably
less
crude
he
and
she
were
anyhow
at
one
in
the
profound
and
staggering
conviction
of
immortality
enlightened
by
that
conviction
he
was
able
to
reduce
the
physical
and
mental
tragedy
of
the
to
its
right
proportions
as
a
transiency
between
the
heroic
past
and
the
inconceivable
future
and
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
and
the
stillness
of
the
house
perfumed
by
the
abnegation
of
maggie
and
the
desolate
woe
of
the
ruined
minnie
whom
the
clayhangers
would
save
and
in
the
outer
stillness
of
the
little
street
with
the
norman
sticking
up
out
of
history
at
the
bottom
of
its
slope
edwin
felt
uplifted
and
serene
he
returned
to
the
she
s
asleep
now
in
some
room
i
ve
never
seen
he
reflected
he
was
suddenly
thinking
of
his
wife
during
the
previous
night
lying
sleepless
close
to
her
while
she
slept
soundly
he
had
reflected
long
and
with
increasing
pessimism
the
solace
of
hilda
s
kiss
had
proved
fleeting
she
had
not
realised
he
himself
was
then
only
realising
little
by
little
the
enormity
of
the
thing
she
had
done
what
she
had
deliberately
and
obstinately
done
was
to
turn
him
out
of
his
house
no
injury
that
she
might
have
chosen
could
have
touched
him
more
closely
more
painfully
for
his
house
to
him
was
sacred
her
blundering
with
the
servants
might
be
condoned
but
what
excuse
was
it
possible
to
find
for
this
precipitate
flight
to
london
involving
the
summary
ejectment
from
the
home
of
him
who
had
created
the
home
and
for
and
by
whom
the
home
chiefly
existed
true
the
astounding
feat
of
had
been
aided
by
the
mere
chance
of
maggie
s
calling
capricious
women
were
always
thus
lucky
maggie
s
suggestion
and
request
had
given
some
afterglow
of
reason
to
the
mad
project
but
the
justification
was
still
far
from
sufficient
and
the
odious
idea
haunted
him
that
even
if
maggie
had
not
called
with
her
tale
hilda
would
have
persisted
in
her
scheme
all
the
same
yes
she
was
capable
of
that
the
argument
that
george
s
eyes
of
whose
condition
she
had
learnt
by
mere
hazard
could
not
wait
until
domestic
affairs
were
arranged
was
too
grotesque
to
deserve
an
answer
lying
thus
close
to
his
wife
in
the
dark
he
had
perceived
that
the
conflict
between
his
individuality
and
hers
could
never
cease
no
diplomatic
devices
of
manner
could
put
an
end
to
it
and
he
had
seen
also
that
as
they
both
grew
older
and
developed
more
fully
the
conflict
was
becoming
more
serious
he
assumed
that
he
had
faults
but
he
was
solemnly
convinced
that
the
faults
of
hilda
were
tremendous
essential
and
ineradicable
she
had
a
faculty
for
acting
contrary
to
justice
and
contrary
to
sense
which
was
simply
monstrous
and
it
had
always
been
so
her
whole
life
had
been
made
up
of
impulsiveness
and
contumacy
in
that
impulsiveness
witness
the
incredible
scenes
of
the
strange
dartmoor
episode
all
due
to
her
stubborn
irrationality
the
perspective
of
his
marriage
was
plain
to
him
in
the
night
and
it
ended
in
a
rupture
he
had
been
resolutely
blind
to
hilda
s
peculiarities
dismissing
incident
after
incident
as
an
isolated
misfortune
but
he
could
be
blind
no
more
his
marriage
was
all
of
a
piece
and
he
must
and
would
recognise
the
fact
the
sequel
would
be
a
scandal
well
let
it
be
a
scandal
as
the
minutes
and
hours
passed
in
grim
meditation
the
more
attractive
grew
the
lost
freedom
of
the
bachelor
and
the
more
ready
he
felt
to
face
any
ordeal
that
lay
between
him
and
it
and
just
as
it
was
occurring
to
him
that
his
proper
course
was
to
have
fought
a
terrific
open
decisive
battle
with
her
in
front
of
both
maggie
and
ingpen
he
had
fallen
asleep
upon
awaking
barely
in
time
to
arouse
hilda
he
knew
that
the
mood
of
the
night
had
not
melted
away
as
such
moods
are
apt
to
melt
when
the
window
begins
to
show
a
square
of
the
mood
was
even
intensified
hilda
had
divined
nothing
she
never
did
divine
the
tortures
which
she
inflicted
in
his
heart
she
did
not
possess
the
gumption
to
divine
her
demeanour
had
been
amazing
she
averred
that
she
had
not
slept
at
all
instead
of
cajoling
she
bullied
instead
of
tacitly
admitting
that
she
was
infamously
wronging
him
she
had
assumed
a
grievance
of
her
own
without
stating
it
once
she
had
said
discontentedly
about
some
trifle
you
might
any
as
though
the
victim
should
caress
the
executioner
she
had
kissed
him
at
departure
but
not
as
usual
effusively
and
he
had
suffered
the
kiss
in
enmity
and
after
an
unimaginable
general
upset
and
confusion
in
which
george
had
shown
himself
strangely
querulous
she
had
driven
off
with
her
son
unconscious
stupidly
unaware
that
she
was
leaving
a
disaster
behind
her
and
last
of
all
edwin
solitary
had
been
forced
to
perform
the
final
symbolic
act
that
of
locking
him
out
of
his
own
sacred
home
the
affair
had
transcended
belief
all
day
at
the
works
his
bitterness
and
melancholy
had
been
terrible
and
the
works
had
been
shaken
with
apprehension
for
no
angry
menaces
are
more
disconcerting
than
those
of
a
man
habitually
mild
before
evening
he
had
decided
to
write
to
his
wife
from
auntie
hamps
s
a
letter
cold
unanswerable
crushing
that
would
confront
her
unescapably
with
the
alternatives
of
complete
submission
or
complete
separation
the
phrases
of
the
letter
came
into
his
mind
he
would
see
who
was
master
he
had
been
full
of
the
letter
when
he
entered
auntie
hamps
s
lobby
but
the
strange
tone
in
which
maggie
had
answered
his
questions
about
the
sick
woman
had
thrust
the
letter
and
the
crisis
right
to
the
back
of
his
mind
where
they
had
uneasily
remained
throughout
the
evening
and
now
in
the
he
was
reflecting
she
s
asleep
in
some
room
i
ve
never
seen
he
smiled
such
a
smile
candid
generous
and
affectionate
as
was
hilda
s
joy
such
a
smile
as
hilda
dwelt
on
in
memory
when
she
was
alone
the
mood
of
resentment
passed
away
vanished
like
a
nightmare
at
dawn
and
like
one
of
his
liverish
headaches
dispersed
suddenly
after
the
evening
meal
he
saw
everything
differently
he
saw
that
he
had
been
entirely
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
the
situation
and
of
hilda
hilda
was
a
mother
she
had
the
protective
passion
of
maternity
she
was
carried
away
by
her
passions
but
her
passions
were
noble
marvellous
unique
he
himself
could
never
he
thought
humbled
attain
to
her
emotional
heights
he
was
incapable
of
feeling
about
anything
or
anybody
as
she
felt
about
george
the
revelation
concerning
george
s
eyesight
had
shocked
her
overwhelmed
her
with
remorse
driven
every
other
idea
out
of
her
head
she
must
atone
to
george
instantly
instantly
she
must
take
measures
the
most
drastic
and
certain
to
secure
him
from
the
threatened
danger
she
could
not
count
the
cost
till
afterwards
she
was
not
a
woman
in
such
moments
she
was
an
instinct
a
desire
a
ruthless
purpose
and
as
she
felt
towards
george
so
she
must
feel
in
other
circumstances
towards
himself
her
kisses
proved
it
and
her
soothing
hand
when
he
was
unwell
hamps
had
said
eh
dear
what
a
good
mother
dear
hilda
is
a
sentimental
outcry
but
there
was
profound
truth
in
it
truth
which
the
old
woman
had
seen
better
than
he
had
seen
it
i
daresay
there
never
was
such
a
mother
unless
it
s
clara
hyperbole
and
yet
he
himself
now
began
to
think
that
there
never
could
have
been
such
a
mother
as
hilda
clara
too
in
her
way
was
wonderful
smile
as
you
might
these
mothers
were
tremendous
the
mysterious
sheen
of
their
narrow
and
deep
lives
dazzled
him
for
the
first
time
perhaps
he
bowed
his
head
to
clara
but
hilda
was
far
beyond
clara
she
was
not
only
a
mother
but
a
lover
would
he
cut
himself
off
from
her
loving
why
for
what
to
live
alone
in
the
arid
and
futile
freedom
of
a
tertius
ingpen
such
a
notion
was
fatuous
where
lay
the
difficulty
between
himself
and
hilda
there
was
no
difficulty
how
had
she
harmed
him
she
had
not
harmed
him
everything
was
all
right
he
had
only
to
understand
he
understood
as
for
her
impulsiveness
her
wrongheadedness
her
bizarre
ratiocination
he
knew
how
to
accept
them
for
was
he
not
a
philosopher
they
were
indeed
part
of
the
incomparable
romance
of
existence
with
these
prodigious
and
tantalising
creatures
he
admitted
that
hilda
in
some
aspects
transcended
him
but
in
others
he
was
comfortably
confident
of
his
own
steady
conquering
superiority
he
thought
of
her
with
the
most
exquisite
devotion
he
pictured
the
secret
tenderness
of
their
reunion
amid
the
conventional
gloom
of
auntie
hamps
s
he
was
confident
of
his
ability
to
manage
hilda
at
any
rate
in
the
big
things
for
example
the
disputed
points
of
his
entry
into
public
activity
and
their
removal
from
trafalgar
road
into
the
country
the
sturdiness
of
the
male
inspired
him
at
the
same
time
the
thought
of
the
dark
mood
from
which
he
had
emerged
obscurely
perturbed
him
like
a
fearful
danger
passed
and
he
argued
to
himself
with
satisfaction
and
yet
not
quite
with
conviction
that
he
had
yielded
to
maggie
and
not
to
hilda
in
the
affair
of
the
journey
to
london
and
that
therefore
his
masculine
marital
dignity
was
intact
and
then
he
started
at
a
strange
sound
below
which
somehow
recalled
him
to
the
nervous
tension
of
the
house
it
was
a
knocking
at
the
his
heart
thumped
at
the
formidable
muffled
noise
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
jumped
up
and
glanced
at
the
bed
auntie
hamps
was
not
wakened
he
went
downstairs
where
the
gas
which
he
had
lighted
was
keeping
watch
chapter

was
at
the

the
expression
of
his
astonishment
hello

oh

t

not

up

with
the
habit
of

on
to

inner
mat
he
seemed
excited
and
edwin
feared
that
he
had
just
learnt
of
auntie
hamps
s
illness
and
had
come
in
the
middle
of
the
night
ostensibly
to
make
enquiries
but
really
to
make
a
grievance
of
the
fact
that
the
benbows
had
been
kept
in
ignorance
he
could
already
hear
albert
demanding
why
have
you
kept
us
in
ignorance
it
was
quite
a
benbow
phrase
edwin
shut
the
door
and
shut
out
the
dark
and
windy
glimpse
of
the
outer
world
which
had
emphasised
for
a
moment
the
tense
seclusion
of
the
house
you
ve
heard
of
course
about
the
accident
to
ingpen
said
albert
his
hands
were
deep
in
his
overcoat
pockets
the
collar
of
the
thin
rather
shabby
overcoat
was
turned
up
an
old
cap
adhered
to
the
back
of
his
head
while
talking
he
slowly
lifted
his
feet
one
after
the
other
as
though
desiring
to
get
warmth
by
stamping
but
afraid
to
stamp
in
the
night
no
i
haven
t
said
edwin
with
false
calmness
what
accident
the
perspective
of
events
seemed
to
change
auntie
hamps
s
illness
to
recede
and
a
definite
and
familiar
apprehension
to
be
supplanted
by
a
fear
more
formidable
because
it
was
a
fear
of
the
unknown
it
was
all
in
the
late
special
benbow
protested
as
if
his
pride
had
been
affronted
well
i
haven
t
seen
the
what
is
it
and
edwin
thought
is
somebody
else
dying
too
broke
ingpen
was
inspecting
the
next
to
the
part
of
the
came
through
and
knocked
a
loose
nut
off
the
blunger
right
into
his
groin
whose
works
albert
answered
in
a
light
tone
mine
and
how
s
he
going
on
well
he
s
had
an
operation
and
sterling
s
got
the
nut
out
of
course
they
didn
t
know
what
it
was
till
they
got
it
out
and
now
ingpen
wants
to
see
you
at
once
that
s
why
i
ve
come
where
is
he
at
the
hospital
pirehill
no
the
clowes
moorthorne
road
you
know
is
he
going
on
all
right
he
s
very
weak
he
can
scarcely
whisper
but
he
wants
you
i
ve
been
up
there
all
the
time
practically
edwin
seized
his
overcoat
from
the
rack
i
had
a
rare
job
finding
ye
benbow
went
on
i
d
no
idea
you
weren
t
all
at
home
i
wakened
most
of
hulton
street
over
it
it
was
smiths
next
door
came
out
at
last
and
told
me
missis
and
george
had
gone
to
london
and
you
were
over
here
i
wonder
who
told
them
edwin
mumbled
as
albert
helped
him
with
the
overcoat
i
must
tell
maggie
we
ve
got
some
illness
here
you
know
oh
yes
auntie
very
sudden
seemed
to
get
worse
fact
is
i
was
sitting
up
while
maggie
has
a
bit
of
sleep
she
was
going
to
send
round
for
clara
in
the
morning
i
ll
just
run
up
to
mag
having
thus
by
judicious
misrepresentation
deprived
the
benbows
of
a
grievance
edwin
moved
towards
the
stairs
maggie
dressed
already
stood
at
the
top
of
them
alert
anxious
adequate
albert
is
that
you
after
a
few
seconds
of
quick
murmured
explanation
edwin
and
albert
departed
and
as
they
went
maggie
in
a
voice
doubly
harassed
but
cheerful
and
oily
called
out
after
them
how
glad
she
would
be
and
what
a
help
it
would
be
if
clara
could
come
round
early
in
the
morning
the
small
clowes
hospital
was
high
up
in
the
town
opposite
the
park
near
the
station
and
the
and
not
far
from
the
moorthorne
ridge
behind
its
bushes
through
which
the
wet
swished
and
rustled
it
looked
still
very
new
and
red
in
the
fitful
moonlight
and
indeed
it
was
scarcely
older
than
the
park
and
close
by
and
bursley
had
not
yet
lost
its
naïve
pride
in
the
possession
of
a
hospital
of
its
own
not
much
earlier
in
the
decade
this
town
of
thousand
inhabitants
had
had
to
send
all
its
cases
five
miles
in
cabs
to
pirehill
infirmary
albert
benbow
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
habitué
led
edwin
round
through
an
aisle
of
bushes
to
the
for
he
pushed
open
a
dark
door
walked
into
a
gaslit
vestibule
and
with
the
assured
gestures
of
a
proprietor
invited
edwin
to
follow
a
fat
woman
who
looked
like
a
made
tidy
sat
in
a
in
the
vestibule
close
to
a
radiator
she
signed
to
albert
as
an
old
acquaintance
to
go
forward
and
albert
nodded
in
the
manner
of
one
conspirator
to
another
what
struck
edwin
was
that
this
woman
showed
no
sign
of
being
in
the
midst
of
the
unusual
she
was
utterly
casual
and
and
edwin
had
the
sensation
of
moving
in
a
strange
nocturnal
world
a
world
which
had
always
with
his
own
but
of
which
he
had
been
till
then
most
curiously
ignorant
his
passage
through
the
town
listening
absently
to
albert
s
descriptions
of
the
structural
damage
to
ingpen
and
to
the
works
and
albert
s
defence
against
unbrought
accusations
had
shown
him
that
the
silent
streets
lived
long
after
midnight
in
many
a
lighted
window
here
and
there
and
in
the
movements
of
mysterious
but
not
furtive
frequenters
and
he
seemed
to
have
been
impinging
upon
enigmas
of
misfortune
or
of
love
at
the
other
end
of
the
thread
of
adventure
was
his
aunt
s
harsh
bedroom
with
maggie
stolidly
watching
the
last
ebb
of
senile
vitality
and
at
this
end
was
the
hospital
full
of
novel
and
disturbing
vibrations
and
tertius
ingpen
waiting
to
impose
upon
him
some
charge
or
secret
at
the
top
of
the
naked
stairs
which
came
after
a
dark
corridor
was
a
long
naked
resounding
passage
lighted
by
a
tiny
jet
at
either
end
a
cough
from
behind
a
door
came
echoing
out
and
filled
the
night
and
the
passage
and
then
at
another
door
appeared
a
tall
thin
fair
nurse
in
blue
and
white
with
thin
lips
and
a
slight
smile
hard
and
disdainful
here
s
clayhanger
nurse
muttered
albert
benbow
taking
off
his
cap
with
a
grimace
at
once
sycophantic
and
grandiose
edwin
imagined
that
he
knew
by
sight
everybody
in
the
town
above
a
certain
social
level
but
he
had
no
memory
of
the
face
of
the
nurse
how
is
he
he
asked
awkwardly
fingering
his
hat
the
girl
merely
raised
her
eyebrows
you
mustn
t
stay
said
she
in
a
mincing
but
rather
loud
voice
that
matched
her
lips
oh
no
i
won
t
i
suppose
better
stop
outside
said
benbow
edwin
followed
the
nurse
into
a
darkened
room
of
which
the
chief
article
of
furniture
appeared
to
be
a
screen
behind
the
screen
was
a
bed
and
on
the
bed
in
the
deep
obscurity
lay
a
form
under
creaseless
bedclothes
edwin
first
recognised
ingpen
s
beard
then
his
visage
very
pale
and
solemn
and
without
the
customary
spectacles
of
the
whole
body
only
the
eyes
moved
as
edwin
approached
the
bed
he
cast
across
ingpen
a
shadow
from
the
distant
gas
well
old
chap
he
began
with
constraint
this
is
a
nice
state
of
affairs
how
are
you
getting
on
ingpen
s
enquiring
apprehensive
dumb
glance
silenced
the
clumsy
greeting
it
was
just
as
if
he
had
rebuked
this
is
no
time
for
how
d
ye
do
s
when
he
had
apparently
made
sure
that
edwin
was
edwin
ingpen
turned
his
eyes
to
the
nurse
water
he
whispered
the
nurse
shook
her
head
net
yet
she
replied
with
tepid
indifference
ingpen
s
eyes
remained
on
her
a
moment
and
then
went
back
to
edwin
ed
he
whispered
and
gazed
once
more
at
the
nurse
who
looking
away
from
the
bed
did
not
move
edwin
bent
over
the
bed
ed
ingpen
demanded
speaking
very
deliberately
go
to
my
office
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
desk
in
the
bedroom
there
s
some
photos
and
letters
burn
them
before
morning
understand
edwin
was
profoundly
stirred
in
his
emotion
was
pride
at
ingpen
s
trust
astonishment
at
the
sudden
utterly
unexpected
revelation
and
the
thrill
of
romance
he
thought
the
man
is
dying
and
the
tragic
sensation
of
the
vigil
of
the
nocturnal
world
almost
overcame
him
yes
he
said
anything
else
no
what
about
keys
ingpen
gave
him
another
long
glance
trousers
where
are
his
clothes
edwin
asked
the
nurse
whose
lips
were
ironic
oh
they
ll
tell
you
downstairs
you
d
better
go
now
as
he
went
from
the
room
he
could
feel
ingpen
s
glance
following
him
he
raged
inwardly
against
the
callousness
of
the
nurse
it
seemed
monstrous
that
he
should
abandon
ingpen
for
the
rest
of
the
night
defenceless
to
the
cold
tyranny
of
the
nurse
whose
power
over
the
sufferer
was
as
absolute
as
that
of
an
eastern
monarch
who
had
never
heard
of
public
opinion
over
the
meanest
slave
he
could
not
bear
to
picture
to
himself
ingpen
and
the
nurse
alone
together
isn
t
he
allowed
to
drink
he
could
not
help
murmuring
at
the
door
yes
at
intervals
he
wanted
to
chastise
the
nurse
he
imagined
an
endless
succession
of
sufferers
under
her
appalling
inimical
nonchalance
who
had
allowed
her
to
be
a
nurse
had
she
become
a
nurse
in
order
to
take
some
needed
revenge
against
mankind
and
then
he
thought
of
hilda
s
passionate
succouring
tenderness
when
he
himself
was
unwell
he
had
not
been
really
ill
for
years
what
was
happening
to
ingpen
could
never
happen
to
him
because
hilda
stood
everlastingly
between
him
and
such
a
horror
he
considered
that
a
bachelor
was
the
most
pathetic
creature
on
the
earth
he
was
drenched
in
the
fearful
wistful
sadness
of
all
life
the
sleeping
town
auntie
hamps
on
the
edge
of
eternity
minnie
trembling
at
the
menaces
of
her
own
body
hilda
lying
in
some
room
that
he
had
never
seen
and
ingpen
soon
over
observed
albert
benbow
in
the
corridor
edwin
could
have
winced
at
the
words
how
do
you
think
he
is
asked
albert
don
t
know
edwin
replied
look
here
i
ve
got
to
get
hold
of
his
clothes
downstairs
oh
that
s
it
is
it
keys
eh
ii
edwin
had
once
been
in
tertius
ingpen
s
office
at
the
bottom
of
crown
square
hanbridge
but
never
in
the
bedroom
which
ingpen
rented
on
the
top
floor
of
the
same
building
it
had
been
for
seventy
or
eighty
years
a
building
of
four
squat
storeys
but
a
new
landlord
seeing
the
architectural
development
of
the
town
as
a
local
metropolis
and
determined
to
join
in
it
at
a
minimum
of
expense
had
knocked
the
two
lower
storeys
into
one
fronted
them
with
terra
cotta
and
produced
a
lofty
shop
whose
rent
exceeded
the
previous
rent
of
the
entire
house
the
landlord
knew
that
would
not
look
higher
up
the
façade
than
the
and
that
therefore
any
magnificence
above
that
level
was
merely
wasted
the
shop
was
in
the
occupation
of
a
who
gave
away
beautiful
objects
such
as
vases
and
useful
objects
such
as
to
all
purchasers
ingpen
s
office
and
a
solicitor
s
office
were
on
the
first
floor
formerly
the
second
the
third
floor
was
the
headquarters
of
the
hanbridge
and
district
ethical
society
the
top
floor
was
temporarily
unlet
save
for
ingpen
s
room
nobody
except
ingpen
slept
in
the
building
and
he
very
irregularly
the
latchkey
for
the
sidedoor
was
easy
to
choose
in
the
glittering
light
of
the
latest
and
reflectored
gaslamps
which
the
corporation
to
match
the
glories
of
the
new
had
placed
in
crown
square
the
lock
strange
to
say
worked
easily
edwin
entered
somewhat
furtively
and
as
it
were
guiltily
though
in
crown
square
and
the
streets
and
the
other
squares
visible
therefrom
not
a
soul
could
be
seen
the
illuminated
clock
of
the
old
town
hall
at
the
top
of
the
square
showed
minutes
to
four
immediately
within
the
door
began
a
new
very
long
and
rather
mean
staircase
with
which
edwin
was
acquainted
he
closed
the
door
shutting
out
the
light
and
the
town
and
struck
a
match
in
the
empty
building
he
had
walked
into
hanbridge
from
bursley
and
as
soon
as
he
began
to
climb
the
stairs
he
was
aware
of
great
fatigue
both
physical
and
mental
the
calamity
to
ingpen
had
almost
driven
auntie
hamps
out
of
his
mind
it
had
not
however
driven
minnie
out
of
his
mind
he
was
gloomy
and
indignant
on
behalf
of
both
ingpen
and
minnie
they
were
both
victims
minnie
was
undoubtedly
a
fool
and
he
was
about
to
learn
perhaps
to
what
extent
ingpen
had
been
a
fool
each
footstep
sounded
loud
on
the
boards
of
deserted
house
having
used
several
matches
and
arrived
at
the
final
staircase
edwin
wondered
how
he
was
to
distinguish
ingpen
s
room
there
from
the
others
without
trying
keys
in
all
of
them
till
he
got
to
the
right
one
but
on
the
top
landing
he
had
no
difficulty
for
ingpen
s
card
was
fastened
with
a
on
to
the
first
door
he
saw
a
match
burnt
his
fingers
and
expired
just
as
he
was
shaking
out
a
likely
key
from
ingpen
s
bunch
and
then
in
the
black
darkness
he
perceived
a
line
of
light
under
the
door
in
front
of
which
he
stood
he
forgot
his
fatigue
in
an
instant
his
heart
leaped
a
burglar
or
had
ingpen
left
the
gas
burning
ingpen
could
not
have
left
the
gas
burning
since
according
to
albert
benbow
he
had
been
in
bursley
all
afternoon
with
precautions
and
feeling
very
desperate
and
yet
also
craven
he
lit
a
fresh
match
and
managed
quietly
to
open
the
door
which
was
not
locked
as
soon
as
he
beheld
the
illuminated
interior
of
the
room
all
his
skin
crept
and
flushed
as
though
he
had
taken
a
powerful
stimulant
a
girl
reclined
asleep
in
a
small
basket
by
the
he
could
not
see
her
face
which
was
turned
towards
the
wall
and
away
from
the
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
over
an
old
desk
but
she
seemed
slim
and
graceful
and
there
was
something
in
the
abandonment
of
unconsciousness
that
made
her
marvellously
alluring
her
hat
and
gloves
had
been
thrown
on
the
desk
and
a
cloak
lay
on
a
chair
these
coloured
and
intimate
objects
extensions
of
the
veritable
personality
of
the
girl
had
the
effect
of
delightfully
completing
the
furniture
of
a
room
which
was
in
fact
rather
bare
a
narrow
bed
in
the
far
corner
disguised
under
a
green
rug
as
a
sofa
a
green
square
of
carpet
showing
the
unpolished
boards
at
the
sides
the
desk
and
three
chairs
a
primitive
hanging
wardrobe
in
another
corner
hidden
by
a
bulging
linen
curtain
a
portmanteau
a
few
unframed
prints
on
the
walls
an
on
the
mantelpiece
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
chamber
where
ingpen
slept
when
it
was
too
late
or
he
was
too
slack
to
go
to
his
proper
home
but
nothing
else
was
needed
the
scene
was
perfect
the
girl
rendered
it
so
and
immense
envy
of
and
admiration
for
ingpen
surged
through
edwin
who
saw
here
the
realisation
of
a
dream
that
was
to
marriage
what
poetry
is
to
prose
ingpen
might
rail
against
women
and
against
marriage
in
a
manner
exaggerated
and
indefensible
but
he
had
at
any
rate
known
how
to
arrange
his
life
and
how
to
keep
his
own
counsel
he
had
all
the
careless
masculine
freedom
of
his
condition
and
in
the
background
this
exquisite
phenomenon
the
girl
her
trustfulness
her
abandonment
her
secrecy
that
white
ear
peeping
out
of
her
hair
were
his
it
was
staggering
that
such
romance
could
exist
in
the
five
towns
of
all
places
for
edwin
had
the
vague
notion
common
to
all
natives
that
his
own
particular
district
fell
short
of
full
human
nature
in
certain
characteristics
for
example
he
could
credit
a
human
nature
dying
for
love
in
manchester
but
never
in
the
five
towns
even
the
occasional
divorces
that
gave
piquancy
to
life
in
the
five
towns
seemed
to
lack
the
mysterious
glamour
of
all
other
divorces
he
thought
was
it
because
he
was
expecting
her
that
he
sent
me
perhaps
the
desk
was
only
a
blind
and
he
couldn
t
tell
me
any
more
anyhow
i
shall
have
to
break
it
to
her
he
felt
exceedingly
awkward
and
unequal
to
the
situation
so
startling
in
its
novelty
yet
he
did
not
wish
himself
away
as
timidly
hat
in
hand
he
went
forward
into
the
room
the
girl
stirred
and
woke
up
to
the
creaking
of
the
chair
oh
tert
she
murmured
between
sleeping
and
waking
edwin
did
not
like
her
voice
it
reminded
him
of
the
voice
of
the
nurse
whom
he
had
just
left
the
girl
looking
round
perceived
that
it
was
not
tertius
ingpen
who
had
come
in
she
gave
a
short
faint
scream
then
gathered
herself
together
and
with
a
single
movement
stood
up
perfectly
collected
and
on
the
defensive
it
s
all
right
it
s
all
right
said
edwin
ingpen
gave
me
his
keys
and
asked
me
to
come
over
and
get
some
papers
he
wants
i
hope
i
didn
t
frighten
you
i
d
no
idea
she
was
old
she
was
old
that
is
to
say
she
was
not
the
girl
he
had
seen
asleep
before
his
marriage
he
would
have
put
her
age
at
but
now
he
knew
enough
to
be
sure
that
she
must
be
more
than
that
she
was
not
graceful
in
movement
the
expression
of
her
pale
face
was
not
agreeable
her
gestures
were
not
distinguished
and
she
could
not
act
her
part
in
the
idyll
moreover
her
frock
was
shabby
and
untidy
but
chiefly
she
was
old
had
she
been
young
edwin
would
have
excused
all
the
rest
romance
was
not
entirely
destroyed
but
very
little
remained
he
thought
disdainfully
and
as
if
resenting
a
deception
is
this
the
best
he
can
do
and
the
five
towns
sank
back
to
its
ancient
humble
place
in
his
esteem
the
woman
said
with
a
silly
nervous
giggle
i
called
to
see
ingpen
he
wasn
t
expecting
me
and
i
suppose
while
i
was
waiting
i
must
have
dropped
off
to
sleep
it
might
have
been
true
but
to
edwin
it
was
inexpressibly
inane
she
seized
her
hat
and
then
her
cloak
i
m
sorry
to
say
ingpen
s
had
an
accident
said
edwin
she
stopped
both
hands
above
her
head
fingering
her
hat
an
accident
nothing
serious
oh
no
i
don
t
think
so
he
lied
a
machinery
accident
they
had
to
take
him
to
the
clowes
hospital
at
bursley
i
ve
just
come
from
there
she
asked
one
or
two
more
questions
all
the
time
hurrying
her
preparations
to
leave
but
edwin
judged
with
disgust
that
she
was
not
deeply
interested
in
the
accident
true
he
had
minimised
it
but
she
ought
not
to
have
allowed
him
to
minimise
it
she
ought
to
have
obstinately
believed
that
it
was
very
grave
i
do
hope
he
ll
soon
be
all
right
she
said
snatching
at
her
gloves
and
going
to
the
door
good
night
she
gave
another
silly
giggle
preposterous
in
a
woman
of
her
age
then
she
stopped
i
think
you
re
gentleman
enough
not
to
say
anything
about
me
being
here
she
said
rather
nastily
it
was
quite
an
accident
i
could
easily
explain
it
but
you
know
what
people
are
what
a
phrase
i
think
you
re
gentleman
enough
he
blushed
and
offered
the
required
assurance
can
i
let
you
out
he
started
forward
no
thanks
but
you
can
t
open
the
door
yes
i
can
the
stairs
are
all
dark
please
don
t
trouble
yourself
she
said
drily
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
sees
offence
in
the
courtesy
of
a
male
travelling
companion
on
the
railway
he
heard
her
steps
down
the
stairs
closing
the
door
he
went
to
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
blind
perhaps
she
would
pass
up
the
square
but
she
did
not
pass
up
the
square
which
was
peopled
by
nothing
but
meek
gaslamps
under
the
empire
of
the
glowing
clock
in
the
pediment
of
the
old
town
hall
where
had
she
gone
where
did
she
come
from
her
accent
had
no
noticeable
peculiarity
was
she
married
or
single
or
a
widow
perhaps
there
was
hidden
in
her
some
strange
and
seductive
quality
which
he
had
missed
he
saw
the
slim
girl
again
reclining
in
the
after
all
she
was
a
woman
and
she
had
been
in
ingpen
s
room
waiting
for
him
later
seated
in
front
of
the
open
drawer
in
the
old
desk
gathering
together
letters
and
photographs
photographs
of
her
in
adroitly
managed
poses
taken
at
oldham
letters
in
a
woman
s
hand
he
was
penetrated
to
the
marrow
by
the
disastrous
and
yet
beautiful
infelicity
of
things
the
mere
sight
of
the
letters
of
which
he
forebore
to
decipher
a
single
word
even
a
signature
nearly
made
him
cry
the
photographs
were
tragic
with
the
intolerable
evanescence
of
life
by
the
will
of
tertius
ingpen
helpless
on
the
bed
in
the
hospital
these
documents
of
a
passion
or
of
a
fancy
were
to
be
burnt
why
was
it
true
that
ingpen
was
dying
better
to
keep
them
no
they
must
be
burnt
he
rose
and
with
difficulty
burnt
them
by
instalments
in
a
shovel
over
the
tiny
fender
that
enclosed
the
the
room
was
soon
half
full
of
smoke
why
had
he
deceived
the
woman
as
to
the
seriousness
of
ingpen
s
accident
to
simplify
and
mitigate
the
interview
to
save
himself
trouble
that
was
all
well
she
would
learn
soon
enough
his
eye
caught
a
print
on
the
wall
above
the
bed
a
classic
example
of
the
sentimentality
of
marcus
stone
departing
cavalier
drooping
maiden
terraced
garden
it
was
a
dreadful
indictment
of
the
tertius
ingpen
who
talked
so
well
with
such
intellectual
aplomb
with
such
detachment
and
exceptional
cynicism
it
was
like
a
ray
exposing
some
secret
sinister
corner
in
the
man
s
soul
he
had
hung
up
that
print
because
it
gave
him
pleasure
poor
chap
but
edwin
loved
him
he
decided
that
he
would
call
again
at
the
hospital
before
returning
to
auntie
hamps
s
impossible
that
the
man
was
dying
if
the
doctor
or
the
matron
had
thought
he
was
in
danger
they
would
have
summoned
his
relatives
he
might
be
dying
he
might
be
dead
he
must
have
immediately
feared
death
or
he
would
not
have
imposed
upon
edwin
such
an
errand
what
simple
touching
admirable
trust
in
a
friend
s
loyalty
the
man
had
displayed
edwin
put
out
the
which
exploded
lit
a
match
gave
a
great
yawn
put
out
the
gas
and
began
the
enterprise
of
leaving
the
house
iii
look
here
i
must
have
some
tea
said
edwin
curtly
and
yet
appealingly
to
maggie
who
opened
the
door
for
him
at
auntie
hamps
s
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
he
had
been
to
the
hospital
again
and
having
reported
in
three
words
to
ingpen
whose
condition
was
unchanged
had
remained
there
some
time
but
he
had
said
nothing
to
ingpen
about
the
woman
at
six
o
clock
the
matron
had
come
into
the
room
and
the
nurse
thenceforward
until
seven
o
clock
when
she
went
off
duty
was
a
changed
girl
edwin
slightly
knew
the
matron
who
was
sympathetic
but
strangely
pessimistic
considering
her
healthy
full
figure
the
water
s
boiling
answered
maggie
in
a
comforting
tone
and
disappeared
instantly
into
the
kitchen
edwin
thought
there
are
some
things
that
girl
understands
she
had
shown
no
curiosity
no
desire
to
impart
news
because
she
had
immediately
comprehended
that
edwin
was
or
imagined
himself
to
be
at
the
end
of
his
endurance
maggie
with
simple
and
surpassing
wisdom
had
just
said
to
herself
he
s
been
out
all
night
and
he
s
not
used
to
it
for
a
moment
he
felt
that
maggie
was
wiser
and
more
intimately
close
to
him
than
anybody
else
in
the
world
in
the
she
called
out
from
the
kitchen
and
in
the
small
there
was
a
fire
it
was
like
a
living
welcoming
creature
the
cloth
was
laid
the
gas
was
lighted
on
the
table
was
beautiful
fresh
bread
and
butter
a
word
a
tone
a
glance
of
his
on
the
previous
evening
had
been
enough
to
bring
back
the
into
use
happily
the
wind
suited
the
chimney
he
had
scarcely
sat
down
in
front
of
the
fire
when
maggie
entered
with
the
teapot
and
at
the
sight
of
the
teapot
edwin
felt
that
he
was
saved
before
the
tea
was
out
of
the
teapot
it
had
already
magically
alleviated
the
desperate
sensations
of
physical
fatigue
and
moral
weariness
which
had
almost
overcome
him
on
the
way
from
the
hospital
in
the
chill
and
muddy
dawn
what
will
you
have
to
eat
said
maggie
nothing
i
couldn
t
eat
to
save
my
life
perhaps
you
ll
have
a
bit
of
later
said
maggie
blandly
he
shook
his
head
how
is
she
worse
said
maggie
but
she
s
slept
who
s
up
with
her
now
minnie
no
clara
oh
she
s
come
she
came
at
seven
edwin
was
drinking
the
divine
tea
after
a
few
gulps
he
told
maggie
briefly
about
tertius
ingpen
saying
that
he
had
had
to
go
on
business
for
ingpen
to
hanbridge
are
you
all
right
for
the
present
she
asked
after
a
few
moments
he
nodded
he
was
eating
you
had
any
sleep
at
all
he
mumbled
munching
oh
yes
a
little
she
answered
cheerfully
leaving
the
room
he
poured
out
more
tea
and
then
sat
down
in
the
sole
for
a
minute
s
reflection
before
going
upstairs
and
thence
to
the
works
not
until
he
woke
up
did
he
realise
that
there
had
been
any
danger
of
his
going
to
sleep
the
earthenware
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
a
birthday
gift
from
clara
and
albert
showed
five
minutes
past
eleven
putting
no
reliance
on
the
cheap
horrible
clock
he
looked
at
his
watch
which
had
stopped
for
lack
of
winding
up
the
fire
was
very
low
his
chief
thought
was
it
can
t
possibly
be
eleven
o
clock
because
i
haven
t
been
down
to
the
works
and
i
haven
t
sent
word
i
m
not
coming
either
he
got
up
hurriedly
and
had
reached
the
door
when
a
sound
of
a
voice
on
the
stairs
held
him
still
like
an
enchantment
it
seemed
to
be
the
voice
eloquent
and
indeed
somewhat
of
the
rev
christian
flowerdew
the
new
superintendent
of
the
bursley
wesleyan
methodist
circuit
the
voice
said
i
do
hope
so
and
then
offered
a
resounding
remark
about
the
weather
being
the
kind
of
weather
that
bad
as
it
was
people
must
expect
in
view
of
the
time
of
year
maggie
s
voice
concurred
as
soon
as
the
closed
edwin
peeped
cautiously
out
of
the
who
was
that
he
murmured
flowerdew
she
wanted
him
albert
sent
for
him
early
this
morning
maggie
came
into
the
room
and
shut
the
door
i
ve
been
to
sleep
said
edwin
yes
i
know
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
you
disturbed
they
re
all
here
who
are
all
here
clara
and
the
children
auntie
asked
to
see
all
of
them
they
waited
in
the
for
flowerdew
to
go
bert
didn
t
go
to
school
this
morning
in
case
because
it
was
so
far
off
clara
fetched
the
others
out
of
school
except
rupy
of
course
he
doesn
t
go
good
heavens
i
never
came
across
such
a
morbid
lot
in
my
life
i
believe
they
like
it
clara
could
be
heard
marshalling
the
brood
up
the
stairs
you
d
better
go
up
said
maggie
persuasively
i
d
better
go
to
the
works
i
m
no
use
here
what
time
is
it
after
eleven
i
think
you
d
better
go
up
does
she
ask
for
me
oh
yes
all
the
time
sometimes
but
she
forgets
for
a
bit
well
anyhow
i
must
wash
myself
and
change
my
collar
all
right
wash
yourself
then
how
is
she
now
she
isn
t
taking
anything
when
edwin
nervously
pushed
open
the
bedroom
door
the
room
seemed
to
be
crowded
over
the
heads
of
clustering
children
towered
clara
and
albert
as
soon
as
the
watchful
albert
caught
sight
of
edwin
he
made
a
conspiratorial
sign
and
hurried
to
the
door
driving
edwin
out
again
didn
t
know
you
were
here
edwin
muttered
i
say
albert
whispered
has
she
made
a
will
i
don
t
know
the
bedroom
door
half
opened
and
clara
in
her
shabby
morning
dress
glidingly
joined
them
he
doesn
t
know
said
albert
to
clara
clara
s
pretty
face
scowled
a
little
as
she
asked
sharply
and
resentfully
then
who
does
know
i
should
ha
thought
know
said
edwin
me
i
like
that
she
hasn
t
spoken
to
me
for
months
has
she
albert
and
she
was
always
frightfully
close
about
all
these
things
about
what
things
well
you
know
it
was
a
fact
auntie
hamps
had
never
discussed
her
own
finance
or
her
testamentary
dispositions
with
anybody
and
nobody
had
ever
dared
to
mention
such
subjects
to
her
don
t
you
think
you
d
better
ask
her
said
clara
albert
thinks
you
ought
no
i
don
t
said
edwin
with
curt
disdain
well
then
i
shall
albert
decided
so
long
as
you
don
t
do
it
while
i
m
there
edwin
said
menacingly
if
you
want
to
ask
people
about
their
wills
you
ought
to
ask
them
before
they
re
actually
dying
can
t
you
see
you
can
t
worry
her
about
her
will
now
he
was
intensely
disgusted
he
thought
of
hamps
s
bed
and
of
tertius
ingpen
s
bed
and
of
the
woman
at
dead
of
night
in
ingpen
s
room
and
of
minnie
s
case
and
the
base
insensibility
of
albert
and
clara
made
him
feel
sick
he
wondered
whether
any
occasion
would
ever
have
solemnity
enough
for
them
to
make
them
behave
with
some
distinction
some
grandeur
for
himself
if
he
could
have
secured
a
fortune
by
breathing
one
business
word
to
auntie
hamps
just
then
he
would
have
let
the
fortune
go
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
said
clara
murmured
in
the
glance
of
both
clara
and
albert
edwin
saw
hatred
and
envy
clara
especially
had
never
forgiven
him
for
preventing
their
father
from
pouring
money
into
that
sieve
her
husband
nor
for
hilda
s
wounding
tongue
nor
for
his
worldly
success
and
they
both
suspected
that
either
maggie
or
auntie
hamps
had
told
him
of
albert
s
default
in
the
payment
of
interest
and
so
fear
was
added
to
their
hatred
and
envy
they
all
entered
the
bedroom
the
children
having
been
left
alone
only
a
few
seconds
rupert
wearing
a
new
blue
overcoat
with
gilt
buttons
had
partially
scrambled
on
to
the
bed
the
pale
veiled
hands
of
auntie
hamps
could
be
seen
round
his
right
hand
rupert
had
grown
enormous
and
had
already
utterly
forgotten
the
time
when
he
was
two
years
old
the
others
equally
altered
stood
two
on
either
side
of
the
bed
bert
and
young
clara
to
the
right
and
amy
and
lucy
to
the
left
lucy
was
crying
and
amy
was
benignantly
wiping
her
eyes
bert
a
great
lump
of
a
boy
was
to
leave
school
at
christmas
but
he
was
still
ranked
with
the
other
children
as
a
child
young
clara
sharply
and
bert
heavily
turned
round
to
witness
the
entrance
of
their
elders
oh
here
s
uncle
edwin
edwin
yes
auntie
the
moral
values
of
the
room
were
instantly
changed
by
the
tone
in
which
auntie
hamps
had
murmured
edwin
all
the
benbows
knew
and
edwin
himself
knew
that
a
personage
of
supreme
importance
in
auntie
hamps
s
eyes
had
come
into
the
scene
the
benbows
became
secondary
and
even
auntie
hamps
s
grasp
of
rupert
s
hand
loosened
and
having
already
kissed
her
the
child
slipped
off
the
bed
edwin
approached
and
over
the
heads
of
the
children
and
between
the
great
darkening
curtains
he
could
at
last
see
the
face
of
the
dying
woman
like
a
senile
doll
s
face
amid
the
confusion
of
wrappings
and
bedclothes
the
eyes
seemed
to
burn
beneath
the
white
forehead
and
sparse
grey
hair
the
cheeks
still
rounded
were
highly
flushed
over
a
very
small
part
of
their
surface
the
mouth
always
open
was
drawn
in
and
the
chin
still
rounded
like
the
cheeks
protruded
the
manner
of
auntie
hamps
s
noisy
breathing
like
the
puzzled
gaze
of
her
eyes
indicated
apprehension
of
the
profoundest
acutest
sort
eh
said
she
in
a
somewhat
falsetto
voice
jerky
and
excessively
feeble
i
thought
i
d
lost
you
her
hand
was
groping
about
no
no
said
edwin
leaning
over
between
young
clara
and
rupert
she
s
feeling
for
your
hand
edwin
said
clara
he
quickly
took
her
hot
brittle
fingers
they
seemed
to
cling
to
his
for
essential
support
have
you
been
to
the
works
auntie
hamps
asked
the
question
as
though
the
answer
to
it
would
end
all
trouble
no
he
said
not
yet
eh
that
s
right
that
s
right
she
murmured
apparently
much
impressed
by
a
new
proof
of
edwin
s
wisdom
i
ve
had
a
sleep
what
i
ve
been
having
a
sleep
he
repeated
more
loudly
eh
that
s
right
that
s
right
i
m
so
glad
the
children
have
been
to
see
me
amy
did
you
kiss
me
auntie
hamps
looked
at
amy
hard
as
if
for
the
first
time
yes
auntie
and
then
amy
began
to
cry
better
take
them
away
edwin
suggested
aside
to
albert
it
s
as
much
as
she
can
stand
the
parson
s
only
just
gone
you
know
albert
obedient
gave
the
word
of
command
and
the
room
was
full
of
movement
eh
children
children
auntie
hamps
appealed
everybody
stood
stockstill
gazing
attendant
eh
children
bless
you
all
for
coming
if
you
grow
up
as
good
as
your
mother
it
s
all
i
ask
all
i
ask
your
mother
and
i
have
never
had
a
cross
word
have
we
mother
no
auntie
said
clara
with
a
sweet
touching
smile
that
accentuated
the
fragile
charm
of
her
face
never
since
mother
was
as
tiny
as
you
are
auntie
hamps
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
during
a
few
strained
breaths
and
then
smiled
for
an
instant
at
the
departing
children
who
filed
out
of
the
room
rupert
loitered
behind
gazing
at
his
mother
the
mere
contrast
between
the
infant
so
healthy
and
the
dying
old
woman
was
pathetic
to
edwin
clara
with
an
exquisite
reassuring
gesture
and
smile
picked
up
the
stout
rupert
and
kissed
him
and
carried
him
to
the
door
while
auntie
hamps
looked
at
mother
and
son
ecstatic
edwin
yes
auntie
they
were
alone
now
she
had
not
loosed
his
hand
her
voice
was
very
faint
and
he
bent
over
her
still
lower
in
the
alcove
of
the
curtains
which
seemed
to
stretch
very
high
above
them
have
you
heard
from
hilda
not
yet
by
the
second
post
perhaps
it
s
about
george
s
eyes
isn
t
it
yes
she
s
done
quite
right
quite
right
it
s
just
like
hilda
i
do
hope
and
pray
the
boy
s
eyesight
is
safe
oh
yes
said
edwin
safe
enough
you
really
think
so
she
had
the
air
of
hanging
on
his
words
he
nodded
what
a
blessing
she
sighed
deeply
with
relief
edwin
thought
i
believe
her
relations
must
have
been
her
passion
and
he
was
impressed
by
the
intensity
of
that
passion
edwin
yes
auntie
has
that
girl
gone
yet
who
he
questioned
and
added
more
softly
minnie
d
you
mean
his
own
voice
sounded
too
powerful
too
healthy
and
dominating
in
comparison
with
her
failing
murmurs
auntie
hamps
nodded
yes
minnie
not
yet
she
s
going
yes
because
i
can
t
trust
maggie
to
see
to
it
i
ll
see
to
it
has
she
done
the
silvers
d
you
know
she
s
doing
them
answered
edwin
who
thought
it
would
be
best
to
carry
out
the
deception
with
artistic
completeness
she
needn
t
have
her
dinner
before
she
goes
no
no
auntie
hamps
s
face
and
tone
hardened
why
should
she
all
right
and
if
she
asks
for
her
wages
tell
her
i
say
there
s
nothing
due
under
the
circumstances
all
right
auntie
edwin
agreed
desperate
maggie
followed
by
clara
softly
entered
the
room
auntie
hamps
glanced
at
them
with
a
certain
cautious
suspicion
as
though
one
or
other
of
them
was
capable
of
thwarting
her
in
the
matter
of
minnie
then
her
eyes
closed
and
edwin
was
aware
of
a
slackening
of
her
hold
on
his
hand
the
doctor
who
called
half
an
hour
later
said
that
she
might
never
speak
again
and
she
never
did
her
last
conscious
moments
were
moments
of
satisfaction
edwin
slowly
released
his
hand
where
s
albert
he
asked
clara
merely
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
he
s
taking
the
children
home
and
then
he
s
going
to
the
works
he
ought
to
have
gone
long
ago
there
s
a
dreadful
upset
there
i
suppose
there
is
said
edwin
who
had
forgotten
that
the
accident
must
have
almost
brought
albert
s
manufactory
to
a
standstill
and
he
wondered
whether
it
was
the
family
instinct
or
anxiety
about
auntie
hamps
s
will
that
had
caused
albert
to
absent
himself
from
business
on
such
a
critical
morning
i
ought
to
go
too
he
muttered
as
a
full
picture
of
a
lithographic
establishment
masterless
swept
into
his
mind
have
you
telegraphed
to
hilda
clara
demanded
no
haven
t
you
what
s
the
use
well
i
should
have
thought
you
would
oh
no
he
said
falsely
mild
i
shall
write
he
was
immensely
glad
that
hilda
was
not
present
in
the
house
to
complicate
still
further
the
human
equation
maggie
was
silently
examining
the
face
obscured
in
the
gloom
of
the
curtains
instead
of
remaining
late
that
night
at
the
works
edwin
came
back
to
the
house
before
six
o
clock
he
had
had
word
that
the
condition
of
tertius
ingpen
was
still
unchanged
clara
had
gone
home
to
see
to
her
children
s
evening
meal
maggie
sat
alone
in
the
darkened
bedroom
where
auntie
hamps
her
features
a
mere
pale
blur
between
the
curtains
still
withheld
the
secret
of
her
soul
s
reality
from
the
world
even
in
the
final
unconsciousness
there
was
something
grandiose
which
lingered
from
her
crowning
magnificent
deceptions
and
obstinate
effort
to
safeguard
the
structure
of
society
the
sublime
obstinacy
of
the
woman
had
transformed
hypocrisy
into
a
virtue
and
not
the
imminence
of
the
infinite
unknown
had
sufficed
to
make
her
apostate
to
the
steadfast
principles
of
her
mortal
career
what
about
edwin
asked
oh
clara
and
i
will
manage
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
edwin
opened
it
minnie
abashed
but
already
taking
courage
stood
there
blinking
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
ah
he
breathed
hilda
s
scrawling
calligraphy
was
on
the
envelope
the
letter
read
darling
boy
george
has
influenza
charlie
says
temp
anyway
so
of
course
he
can
t
go
out
i
knew
this
morning
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
janet
and
charlie
send
their
love
your
ever
loving
wife
hilda
he
was
exceedingly
uplifted
and
happy
and
exhausted
hilda
s
handwriting
moved
him
the
whole
missive
was
like
a
personal
emanation
from
her
it
lived
with
her
vitality
it
fought
for
the
mastery
of
the
household
interior
against
the
mysterious
spell
of
the
dying
woman
your
loving
wife
never
before
during
their
marriage
had
she
written
a
phrase
so
comforting
and
exciting
he
thought
my
faith
in
her
is
never
worthy
of
her
and
his
faith
leaped
up
and
became
worthy
of
her
george
has
got
influenza
he
said
indifferently
george
but
influenza
s
very
serious
for
him
isn
t
it
maggie
showed
alarm
why
should
it
be
considering
he
nearly
died
of
it
at
orgreaves
oh
he
ll
be
all
right
but
maggie
had
put
fear
into
edwin
a
superstitious
fear
influenza
indeed
might
be
serious
for
george
suppose
he
died
of
it
people
did
die
of
influenza
auntie
hamps
tertius
ingpen
and
now
george
all
these
anxieties
mingling
with
his
joy
in
the
thought
of
hilda
and
all
the
brooding
rooms
of
the
house
waiting
in
light
or
in
darkness
for
a
decisive
event
i
must
go
and
lie
down
he
said
he
could
contain
no
more
sensations
do
said
maggie
iv
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
auntie
hamps
s
funeral
a
procession
consisting
of
the
following
people
moved
out
of
the
small
stuffy
of
her
house
across
the
lobby
into
the
the
rev
christian
flowerdew
the
rev
guy
cliffe
second
minister
the
aged
reverend
josiah
higginbotham
supernumerary
minister
the
chapel
and
the
circuit
stewards
the
doctor
edwin
maggie
clara
bert
and
young
clara
being
respectively
the
eldest
nephew
and
the
eldest
niece
of
the
deceased
and
finally
albert
benbow
albert
came
last
because
he
had
constituted
himself
the
marshal
of
the
ceremonies
in
the
the
coffin
with
its
hideous
brass
plate
and
handles
lay
upon
two
chairs
and
was
covered
with
white
wreaths
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
was
placed
a
small
table
with
a
white
cloth
on
the
cloth
a
large
inlaid
box
in
which
auntie
hamps
had
kept
odd
photographs
and
on
the
box
a
black
book
the
drawn
blinds
created
a
beautiful
soft
silvery
gloom
which
solemnised
everything
and
made
even
the
clumsy
carving
on
the
coffin
seem
like
the
finest
antique
work
the
three
ministers
ranged
themselves
round
the
small
table
the
others
stood
in
an
irregular
horseshoe
about
the
coffin
nervous
constrained
and
in
dread
of
catching
each
other
s
glances
higginbotham
by
virtue
of
his
age
began
to
read
the
service
and
auntie
hamps
became
she
her
and
our
sister
nameless
in
the
she
had
been
the
paragon
of
all
excellences
in
the
packed
securely
and
neatly
in
the
coffin
she
was
a
sinner
snatched
from
the
consequences
of
sin
by
a
miracle
of
divine
sacrifice
the
interment
thus
commenced
was
the
result
of
a
compromise
between
two
schools
of
funebrial
manners
sharply
divergent
edwin
immediately
after
the
demise
had
become
aware
of
influences
far
stronger
than
those
which
had
shaped
the
already
interment
of
old
darius
clayhanger
into
a
form
repugnant
to
him
both
albert
and
clara
but
especially
albert
had
assumed
an
elaborate
funeral
with
a
choral
service
at
the
wesleyan
chapel
numerous
guests
a
superb
procession
and
a
substantial
and
costly
meal
in
the
to
conclude
edwin
had
at
once
and
somewhat
domineeringly
decided
no
guests
whatever
outside
the
family
no
service
at
the
chapel
every
rite
reduced
to
its
simplest
when
asked
why
he
had
no
logical
answer
he
soon
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
invite
a
minister
and
the
doctor
he
yielded
intimidated
by
the
sacredness
of
custom
then
not
only
the
wesleyan
chapel
but
its
sunday
school
sent
dignified
emissaries
who
so
little
expected
a
no
to
their
honorific
suggestions
that
the
no
was
unuttered
and
unutterable
certain
other
invitations
were
agreed
upon
the
sunday
school
announced
that
it
would
walk
and
it
prepared
to
walk
all
the
emissaries
spoke
of
auntie
hamps
as
a
saint
they
all
averred
with
restrained
passion
that
her
death
was
an
absolutely
irreparable
loss
to
the
circuit
and
their
apparent
conviction
was
such
that
edwin
s
whole
estimate
of
auntie
hamps
and
of
mankind
was
momentarily
shaken
was
it
conceivable
that
none
of
these
respectable
people
had
arrived
at
the
truth
concerning
auntie
hamps
had
she
deceived
them
all
or
were
they
simply
rewarding
her
in
memory
for
her
ceaseless
efforts
on
behalf
of
the
safety
of
society
edwin
stood
like
a
rock
against
a
service
in
the
wesleyan
chapel
clara
cunningly
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
wesleyan
chapel
would
be
heated
for
the
occasion
whereas
the
chapel
at
the
cemetery
where
scores
of
persons
had
caught
their
deaths
in
the
few
years
of
its
existence
was
never
heated
his
reply
showed
genius
he
would
have
the
service
at
the
house
itself
the
decision
of
the
chief
mourner
might
be
regretted
and
was
regretted
but
none
could
impugn
its
correctitude
nor
its
social
distinction
some
said
approvingly
that
it
was
just
like
edwin
thenceforward
the
arrangements
went
more
smoothly
the
only
serious
difficulty
being
about
the
route
to
the
cemetery
edwin
was
met
by
a
saying
that
the
last
journey
must
be
the
longest
which
meant
that
the
cortège
must
go
up
luke
s
square
and
along
the
market
place
past
the
town
hall
and
the
shambles
encountering
the
largest
number
of
sightseers
instead
of
taking
the
nearest
way
along
wedgwood
street
edwin
chose
wedgwood
street
in
the
discussions
maggie
was
neutral
thus
losing
part
of
the
very
little
prestige
which
she
possessed
clara
and
albert
considered
edwin
to
be
excessively
but
they
were
remarkably
moderate
in
criticism
for
the
reason
that
no
will
had
been
found
maggie
and
clara
had
searched
the
most
secret
places
of
the
house
for
a
will
in
vain
all
that
they
had
found
was
a
brass
and
copper
wrapped
in
and
labelled
for
edwin
with
auntie
s
love
and
a
set
of
combs
equally
wrapped
in
and
labelled
for
maggie
with
auntie
s
love
naught
for
clara
naught
for
the
chicks
albert
who
did
all
the
running
about
had
been
to
see
julian
pidduck
the
wesleyan
solicitor
who
had
a
pew
at
the
back
of
the
chapel
and
was
famous
for
invariably
arriving
at
morning
service
half
an
hour
late
pidduck
knew
of
no
will
albert
had
also
been
to
the
bank
that
is
to
say
the
bank
at
the
top
of
luke
s
square
whose
former
manager
had
been
a
buttress
of
wesleyanism
the
new
manager
after
nearly
eight
years
he
was
still
called
the
new
manager
because
the
previous
manager
old
lovatt
had
been
in
control
for
nearly
thirty
years
breeze
was
ill
upstairs
on
the
residential
floor
with
one
of
his
periodic
attacks
of
boils
the
cashier
however
had
told
albert
that
certain
securities
but
no
testament
were
deposited
at
the
bank
he
had
offered
to
produce
the
securities
but
only
to
edwin
as
the
nearest
relative
albert
had
then
secretly
looked
up
the
pages
entitled
intestates
estates
in
whitaker
s
almanac
and
had
discovered
that
whereas
auntie
hamps
being
intestate
her
personal
property
would
be
divided
equally
between
edwin
maggie
and
clara
her
real
property
would
go
entirely
to
edwin
edwin
also
had
secretly
looked
up
the
same
pages
this
gross
injustice
nearly
turned
albert
from
a
tory
into
a
land
laws
reformer
it
accounted
for
the
comparative
submissiveness
of
clara
and
albert
before
edwin
s
arrogance
as
the
arbiter
of
funerals
they
hoped
that
if
he
was
humoured
he
might
forego
his
rights
they
could
not
credit
and
edwin
maliciously
did
not
tell
them
that
no
matter
what
they
did
he
was
incapable
of
insisting
on
such
rights
while
the
ministers
succeeded
each
other
in
the
conduct
of
the
service
each
after
his
different
manner
edwin
scrutinised
the
coffin
and
the
wreaths
and
the
cards
inscribed
with
mournful
ecstatic
affection
that
nestled
amid
the
flowers
and
the
faces
of
the
audience
and
his
thought
was
this
will
soon
be
over
now
beneath
his
gloomy
and
wearied
expression
he
was
unhappy
but
rather
hopeful
and
buoyant
looking
forward
to
approaching
felicity
his
reflections
upon
the
career
of
auntie
hamps
were
kind
and
utterly
uncritical
he
wondered
what
her
spirit
was
doing
in
that
moment
the
mystery
ennobled
his
mind
yet
he
wondered
also
whether
the
ministers
believed
all
they
were
saying
why
the
superintendent
minister
read
so
well
and
prayed
with
such
a
lack
of
distinction
how
much
the
wreaths
cost
whether
the
sunday
school
deputation
had
silently
arrived
in
the
street
and
why
men
in
overcoats
and
hatless
looked
so
grotesque
in
a
room
and
why
when
men
and
women
were
assembled
on
a
formal
occasion
the
women
always
clung
together
probing
his
pocket
he
felt
a
letter
he
had
received
it
that
morning
from
hilda
george
was
progressing
very
well
and
charlie
orgreave
had
actually
brought
the
oculist
with
his
apparatus
to
see
him
at
charlie
s
house
charlie
would
always
do
impossibilities
for
hilda
it
was
charlie
who
had
once
saved
george
s
life
so
hilda
was
convinced
the
oculist
had
said
that
george
s
vision
was
normal
and
that
he
must
not
wear
glasses
but
that
on
account
of
a
slight
weakness
he
ought
to
wear
a
shade
at
night
in
rooms
which
were
lighted
from
the
top
in
a
few
days
hilda
and
george
would
return
edwin
anticipated
their
arrival
with
an
impatience
almost
gleeful
so
anxious
was
he
to
begin
the
new
life
with
hilda
her
letters
had
steadily
excited
him
he
pictured
the
intimacies
of
their
reunion
he
saw
her
ideally
his
mind
rose
to
the
finest
manifestations
of
her
individuality
and
the
inconveniences
of
that
individuality
grew
negligible
withal
he
was
relieved
that
george
s
illness
had
kept
her
out
of
bursley
during
the
illness
death
and
burial
of
auntie
hamps
had
she
been
there
he
would
have
had
three
persons
to
manage
instead
of
two
and
he
could
not
have
asserted
himself
with
the
same
freedom
and
then
there
was
a
sound
of
sobbing
outside
the
door
minnie
sharing
humbly
but
obstinately
in
the
service
according
to
her
station
had
broken
down
in
irrational
grief
at
the
funeral
of
the
woman
whose
dying
words
amounted
to
an
order
for
her
execution
edwin
though
touched
could
have
smiled
and
he
felt
abashed
before
the
lofty
and
incomprehensible
marvels
of
human
nature
several
outraged
bent
heads
twisted
round
in
the
direction
of
the
door
but
the
minister
intrepidly
continued
with
the
final
prayer
maggie
slipped
out
the
door
closed
and
the
sound
of
sobbing
receded
after
the
benediction
albert
resumed
full
activity
while
the
remainder
of
the
company
stared
and
cleared
their
throats
without
exchanging
a
word
the
news
that
the
hearse
and
coaches
had
not
arrived
helped
them
to
talk
a
little
the
fault
was
not
that
of
the
undertaker
but
edwin
s
the
service
had
finished
too
soon
because
in
response
to
flowerdew
s
official
question
how
much
time
do
you
give
me
he
had
replied
oh
a
quarter
of
an
hour
whereas
albert
the
organiser
had
calculated
upon
half
an
hour
the
representatives
of
the
sunday
school
were
already
lined
up
on
the
pavement
and
on
the
opposite
pavement
and
in
the
roadway
were
knots
of
ragged
callously
inquisitive
spectators
the
vehicles
could
at
length
be
described
on
the
brow
of
church
street
they
descended
the
slope
in
haste
the
four
mutes
nipped
down
with
agility
from
the
hammer
cloths
hung
their
greasy
on
the
ornamental
spikes
of
the
hearse
and
sneaked
grimly
into
the
house
in
a
second
the
flowers
were
shifted
from
the
coffin
and
with
startling
accomplished
swiftness
the
coffin
was
darted
out
of
the
room
without
its
fraudulent
brass
handles
even
being
touched
and
down
the
steps
into
the
hearse
and
the
flowers
replaced
the
one
hitch
was
due
to
edwin
attempting
to
get
into
the
first
coach
instead
of
waiting
for
the
last
one
albert
putting
on
his
new
black
gloves
checked
him
the
ministers
and
the
doctor
had
to
go
first
the
chapel
officials
next
and
the
chief
mourners
edwin
albert
and
bert
had
the
third
coach
the
women
stayed
behind
at
the
door
frowning
at
the
murmurous
crowd
of
shabby
idlers
albert
gave
a
supreme
glance
at
the
vehicles
and
the
walkers
made
a
signal
and
joined
edwin
and
bert
in
the
last
coach
buttoning
his
left
hand
glove
edwin
would
only
hold
his
gloves
in
his
hand
the
cortège
moved
rain
was
threatening
and
the
street
was
muddy
at
the
cemetery
it
was
raining
and
the
walkers
made
a
string
of
glistening
umbrellas
only
the
paid
mutes
had
no
umbrellas
near
the
gates
under
an
umbrella
stood
a
man
with
a
protruding
chin
and
a
wiry
grey
moustache
he
came
straight
to
edwin
and
shook
hands
it
was
breeze
the
bank
manager
his
neck
enveloped
in
a
white
muffler
showed
a
large
excrescence
behind
and
he
kept
his
head
very
carefully
in
one
position
he
said
in
his
defiant
voice
i
only
had
the
news
this
morning
and
i
felt
that
i
should
pay
the
last
tribute
of
respect
to
the
deceased
i
had
known
her
in
business
and
privately
for
many
years
his
greeting
of
albert
was
extremely
reserved
and
albert
showed
him
a
meek
face
albert
s
overdraft
impaired
the
cordiality
of
their
relations
sorry
to
hear
you
ve
got
your
old
complaint
said
edwin
astounded
at
this
act
of
presence
by
the
terrible
vehicles
by
some
municipal
caprice
were
forbidden
to
enter
the
cemetery
and
in
the
rain
between
the
great
names
of
the
town

lawtons
the
blackshaws
the

the
suttons
the
greenes
the
gardiners
the
calverts
the
dawsons
the
brindleys
the
baineses
and
the
woods
the
long
procession
preceded
by
auntie
hamps
tramped
for
a
third
of
a
mile
along
the
asphalted
path
winding
past
the
chapel
to
the
graveside
and
all
the
way
breeze
between
edwin
and
albert
with
bert
a
yard
to
the
rear
talked
about
boils
and
edwin
said
yes
and
no
and
albert
said
nothing
and
at
the
graveside
the
three
ministers
removed
their
flat
round
hats
and
put
on
while
skilfully
holding
their
umbrellas
aloft
and
while
flowerdew
was
reading
from
a
little
book
in
the
midst
of
the
large
encircling
crowd
with
umbrellas
and
the
gravedigger
with
absolute
precision
accompanied
his
words
with
three
castings
of
earth
into
the
hollow
of
the
grave
edwin
scanned
an
adjoining
tombstone
which
marked
the
family
vault
of
isaac
plant
a
renowned
citizen
he
read
chased
in
gilt
letters
on
the
aberdeen
granite
the
following
lines
sacred
to
the
memory
of
adelaide
susan
wife
of
isaac
plant
died
june
aged
years
and
of
mary
wife
of
isaac

died
december
aged
years

of
effie
harriet
wife
of
isaac
plant
died
december
aged
years
flower
and
of
isaac
plant
died
february
aged
years
know
that
my
redeemer
and
the
passionate
career
of
the
aged
and
always
respectable
rip
seemed
to
edwin
to
have
been
a
wondrous
thing
the
love
of
life
was
in
isaac
plant
he
had
risen
above
death
again
and
again
after
having
detested
him
edwin
now
liked
him
on
the
tombstone
and
even
in
that
hilly
and
bleak
burial
ground
with
melancholy
sepulchral
parties
and
white
surplices
dotted
about
the
sodden
slopes
and
the
stiff
antipathetic
multitude
around
the
pit
which
held
auntie
hamps
and
the
terrible
seared
harsh
industrial
landscape
of
the
great
smoking
amphitheatre
below
edwin
felt
happy
in
the
sensation
of
being
alive
and
of
having
to
contend
with
circumstance
he
was
inspired
by
the
legend
of
isaac
plant
and
of
auntie
hamps
who
in
very
different
ways
had
intensely
lived
and
he
thought
in
the
same
mood
of
tertius
ingpen
who
was
now
understood
to
be
past
hope
if
he
died
well
he
also
had
intensely
lived
and
he
thought
too
of
hilda
whose
terrific
vitality
of
emotion
had
caused
him
such
hours
of
apprehension
and
exasperation
he
exulted
in
all
those
hours
it
seemed
almost
a
pity
that
by
reason
of
his
understanding
of
hilda
such
hours
would
not
recur
his
heart
flew
impatiently
forward
into
the
future
to
take
up
existence
with
her
again
when
the
ministers
pocketed
their
and
resumed
their
hats
everybody
except
edwin
appeared
to
feel
relief
in
turning
away
from
the
grave
faces
brightened
footsteps
were
more
alert
in
the
edwin
had
thought
it
will
soon
be
over
and
every
face
near
him
was
saying
it
is
over
but
now
that
it
was
over
edwin
had
a
pang
of
depression
at
the
eagerness
with
which
all
the
mourners
abandoned
auntie
hamps
to
her
strange
and
desolate
grave
amid
the
sinister
population
of
corpses
he
lingered
glancing
about
breeze
also
lingered
and
then
in
his
downright
manner
squarely
approached
edwin
i
ll
walk
down
with
ye
to
the
gates
said
he
yes
said
edwin
breeze
moved
his
head
round
with
care
their
umbrellas
touched
in
front
of
them
the
broken
units
of
a
procession
tramped
in
disorder
chatting
i
ve
got
that
will
for
you
said
breeze
in
a
confidential
tone
what
will
mrs
hamps
s
but
your
cashier
said
there
was
no
will
at
your
place
my
cashier
doesn
t
know
everything
remarked
breeze
and
in
his
voice
was
the
satisfied
grimness
of
a
true
native
of
the
district
and
a
longshaw
man
hamps
deposited
her
will
with
me
as
much
as
a
friend
as
anything
else
the
fact
is
i
had
it
in
my
private
safe
i
should
have
called
with
it
this
morning
but
i
knew
that
you
d
be
busy
and
what
s
more
i
can
t
go
paying
calls
of
a
morning
here
it
is
breeze
drew
an
endorsed
foolscap
envelope
from
the
breast
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
handed
it
to
edwin
thanks
said
edwin
very
curtly
he
could
be
as
native
as
any
native
but
beneath
the
careful
imperturbability
of
his
demeanour
he
was
not
unagitated
i
ve
got
a
receipt
for
you
to
sign
said
breeze
it
s
slipped
into
the
envelope
here
s
an
edwin
comprehended
that
he
must
stand
still
in
the
rain
and
sign
a
receipt
for
the
will
as
best
he
could
under
an
umbrella
he
complied
breeze
said
no
more
breeze
said
edwin
at
the
gates
to
you
mr
clayhanger
the
coaches
trotted
down
the
first
part
of
the
hill
into
bursley
but
as
soon
as
the
road
became
a
street
with
observant
houses
on
either
side
the
pace
was
reduced
to
a
proper
solemnity
edwin
was
amused
and
even
uplifted
by
the
thought
of
the
will
in
his
pocket
his
own
curiosity
concerning
it
diverted
him
he
anticipated
complications
with
a
light
heart
to
albert
he
said
nothing
on
the
subject
which
somehow
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
force
bluntly
into
the
conversation
albert
talked
about
his
misfortunes
at
the
works
including
the
last
straw
of
the
engine
accident
and
all
the
time
he
was
vaguely
indicating
reasons
the
presence
of
bert
in
the
carriage
necessitated
reticence
for
his
default
in
the
to
maggie
at
intervals
he
gave
out
that
he
was
expecting
much
from
bert
who
at
the
new
year
was
to
leave
school
for
the
works
and
bert
taciturn
behind
his
spectacles
had
to
seem
loyal
earnest
and
promising
as
they
approached
the
clowes
hospital
edwin
saw
a
nurse
in
a
bonnet
white
bow
and
fluent
blue
robe
emerging
from
the
shrubbery
and
putting
up
an
umbrella
she
looked
delightful
at
once
modest
and
piquant
until
he
saw
that
she
was
the
and
even
then
she
still
looked
delightful
he
thought
i
d
no
idea
she
could
look
like
that
and
began
to
admit
to
himself
that
perhaps
in
his
encounters
with
her
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
he
had
not
envisaged
the
whole
of
her
personality
involuntarily
he
leaned
forward
her
eyes
were
scintillant
and
active
and
they
caught
his
he
saluted
she
bowed
with
a
most
inviting
challenging
and
human
smile
there
s
nurse
faulkner
he
exclaimed
to
albert
i
must
just
ask
her
how
ingpen
is
i
haven
t
heard
he
made
as
if
to
lean
out
of
the
window
but
you
can
t
stop
the
procession
albert
protested
in
horror
unable
to
conceive
such
an
enormity
i
ll
just
slip
out
said
edwin
guiltily
he
spoke
to
the
coachman
and
the
coach
halted
in
an
instant
he
was
on
the
pavement
drive
on
he
instructed
the
coachman
and
to
the
outraged
albert
i
ll
walk
down
nurse
faulkner
apparently
flattered
by
the
proof
of
her
attractiveness
stopped
and
smiled
upon
the
visitor
she
had
a
letter
in
one
hand
good
afternoon
nurse
good
morning
clayhanger
i
m
just
going
out
for
my
morning
walk
before
breakfast
said
she
she
had
dimples
these
dimples
quite
ignored
edwin
s
mourning
and
the
fact
that
he
had
quitted
a
funeral
in
order
to
speak
to
her
how
is
ingpen
edwin
asked
he
could
read
on
the
envelope
in
her
hand
the
words
the
rev
she
grew
serious
and
said
in
a
low
cheerful
tone
i
think
he
s
going
on
pretty
well
edwin
was
startled
d
you
mean
he
s
getting
better
slowly
he
s
taking
food
more
easily
he
was
undoubtedly
better
this
morning
i
haven
t
seen
him
since
of
course
but
the
matron
seemed
to
think
he
stopped
for
the
dimples
began
to
reappear
matron
always
fears
the
worst
you
know
said
nurse
faulkner
not
without
irony
does
she
the
matron
had
never
held
out
hope
to
edwin
and
he
had
unquestioningly
accepted
her
opinion
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
matron
of
a
hospital
could
be
led
astray
by
her
instinctive
unconscious
appetite
for
gloom
and
disaster
the
nurse
nodded
then
you
think
he
ll
pull
through
i
m
pretty
sure
he
will
but
of
course
i
ve
not
seen
the
doctor
i
mean
since
the
first
night
i
m
awfully
glad
his
brother
came
over
from
darlington
to
see
him
yesterday
evening
you
know
yes
i
just
missed
him
the
nurse
gave
a
little
bow
as
she
moved
up
the
road
just
going
to
the
she
explained
dreadful
weather
we
re
having
he
left
her
feeling
that
he
had
made
a
new
acquaintance
she
s
in
love
with
a
parson
i
bet
he
said
to
himself
and
he
had
to
admit
that
she
had
charm
when
off
duty
the
news
about
ingpen
filled
him
with
bright
joy
everything
was
going
well
hilda
would
soon
be
home
george
s
eyes
were
not
seriously
wrong
the
awful
funeral
was
over
and
his
friend
was
out
of
danger
marvellously
restored
to
him
then
he
thought
of
the
will
he
glanced
about
to
see
whether
anybody
of
importance
was
observing
him
there
was
nobody
the
coaches
were
a
hundred
yards
in
front
he
drew
out
the
envelope
containing
the
will
managed
to
extract
the
will
from
the
envelope
and
opened
the
document
not
very
easily
because
he
was
holding
his
umbrella
a
small
printed
slip
fluttered
to
the
muddy
pavement
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
printed
form
of
attestation
clause
seemingly
cut
from
whitaker
s
almanac
signed
by
the
testator
or
testatrix
as
the
case
may
be
in
the
presence
of
us
both
present
at
the
same
time
etc
she
s
got
that
right
anyhow
he
murmured
then
walking
along
he
read
the
will
of
auntie
hamps
it
was
quickly
spotted
with
raindrops
at
the
house
the
blinds
were
drawn
up
and
the
women
sedately
cheerful
maggie
was
actually
teasing
bert
about
his
new
hat
and
young
clara
active
among
the
preparations
for
tea
for
six
was
intensely
and
seriously
proud
at
being
included
in
the
ceremonial
party
of
adults
she
did
not
suspect
that
the
adults
themselves
had
a
novel
sensation
of
being
genuinely
adult
and
that
the
last
representative
of
the
older
generation
was
gone
and
that
this
common
sensation
drew
them
together
rather
wistfully
oh
by
the
way
there
s
a
telegram
for
you
said
maggie
as
minnie
left
the
after
serving
the
last
trayful
of
hot
dishes
and
pots
edwin
took
the
telegram
it
was
from
hilda
to
say
that
she
and
george
would
return
on
the
morrow
but
what
about
the
house
being
cleaned
and
what
about
servants
cried
edwin
affecting
in
order
to
conceal
his
pleasure
an
annoyance
which
he
did
not
in
the
least
feel
oh
tams
has
been
looking
after
the
house
i
shall
go
round
and
see
her
after
tea
i
ve
got
one
servant
for
hilda
you
never
told
me
anything
about
it
said
edwin
who
was
struck
by
no
means
for
the
first
time
by
the
concealment
which
all
the
women
practised
didn
t
i
maggie
innocently
murmured
and
then
minnie
can
go
and
help
if
necessary
until
you
re
all
settled
again
hadn
t
we
better
have
the
gas
lighted
before
we
begin
and
in
the
warm
cosiness
of
the
small
ugly
shortly
to
be
profaned
by
auctioneers
and
amid
the
odours
of
tea
and
hot
and
surrounded
by
the
family
faces
intimate
beloved
and
disdained
edwin
had
an
exciting
vision
of
the
new
life
with
hilda
and
the
vision
was
shot
through
with
sharp
flitting
thoughts
of
the
once
gorgeous
auntie
hamps
forlorn
in
the
cemetery
and
already
passing
into
oblivion
after
tea
immediately
the
children
had
been
sent
home
he
said
to
albert
i
ve
got
something
for
you
and
offered
the
will
maggie
and
clara
were
upstairs
what
is
it
it
s
auntie
s
will
breeze
had
it
he
gave
it
to
me
in
the
cemetery
it
seems
he
only
knew
this
morning
auntie
was
dead
i
think
that
was
why
he
came
up
well
i
m
albert
muttered
his
hand
trembled
as
he
opened
the
paper
auntie
hamps
had
made
edwin
sole
executor
and
had
left
all
her
property
in
trust
for
clara
s
children
evidently
she
had
reasoned
that
edwin
and
maggie
had
all
they
needed
and
that
the
children
of
such
a
father
as
albert
could
only
be
effectually
helped
in
one
way
which
way
she
had
chosen
the
will
was
seven
years
old
and
the
astounding
thing
was
that
she
had
drawn
it
herself
having
probably
copied
some
of
the
wording
from
some
source
unknown
it
was
a
wise
if
a
rather
ruthless
will
and
its
provisions
like
the
manner
of
making
it
were
absolutely
characteristic
of
the
testatrix
too
mean
to
employ
a
lawyer
she
had
yet
had
a
magnificent
gesture
of
generosity
towards
that
benbow
brood
which
she
adored
in
her
grandiose
way
and
further
she
had
been
clever
enough
not
to
invalidate
the
will
by
some
negligent
informality
it
was
as
tight
as
if
julian
pidduck
himself
had
drawn
it
and
she
had
managed
to
put
albert
in
a
position
highly
exasperating
for
he
was
both
very
pleased
and
very
vexed
in
slighting
him
she
had
aggrandized
his
children
what
of
it
he
asked
nervously
it
s
all
right
so
far
as
i
m
concerned
said
edwin
with
a
short
laugh
and
he
was
sincere
for
he
had
no
desire
whatever
to
take
a
share
of
his
aunt
s
modest
wealth
he
shrank
from
the
trusteeship
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
avoid
it
and
he
was
getting
accustomed
to
power
and
dominion
albert
would
have
to
knuckle
down
to
him
and
clara
too
maggie
and
clara
came
back
together
into
the
room
noticeably
sisterly
they
perceived
at
once
from
the
men
s
faces
that
they
were
in
the
presence
of
a
historic
event
i
say
clary
albert
began
his
voice
quavered
chapter
xx
the
discovery
i
hilda
showed
her
smiling
flattering
face
at
the
door
of
edwin
s
private
office
at
a
few
minutes
to
one
on
saturday
morning
and
she
said
i
had
to
go
to
the
dressmaker
s
after
my
shopping
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
call
for
you
she
added
with
deference
but
i
can
wait
if
you
re
busy
true
that
the
question
of
mourning
had
taken
her
to
the
dressmaker
s
and
that
the
dressmaker
lived
in
shawport
lane
not
four
minutes
from
the
works
but
such
accidents
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
call
which
being
part
of
a
scheme
of
hilda
s
would
have
occurred
in
any
case
i
m
ready
said
edwin
pleased
by
the
vision
of
his
wife
in
the
stylish
black
jacket
and
black
hat
which
she
had
bought
in
london
what
have
you
got
in
that
parcel
it
s
your
new
hilda
replied
depositing
on
the
desk
the
parcel
which
had
been
partly
concealed
behind
her
muff
i
ve
mended
the
sleeves
aha
edwin
lightly
murmured
let
s
have
a
look
at
it
his
benevolent
attitude
towards
the
new
surprised
and
charmed
her
before
her
journey
to
london
with
george
he
would
have
jealously
resented
any
interfering
hand
among
his
apparel
but
since
her
return
he
had
been
exquisitely
amenable
she
thought
proud
of
herself
it
s
really
quite
easy
to
manage
him
i
never
used
to
go
quite
the
right
way
about
it
her
new
system
which
was
one
of
the
results
of
contact
with
london
and
which
had
been
inaugurated
a
week
earlier
on
the
platform
of
knype
station
when
she
stepped
down
from
the
london
train
consisted
chiefly
in
smiles
and
other
devices
to
make
edwin
believe
in
any
discussion
that
she
fully
appreciated
his
point
of
view
often
she
was
startled
to
find
this
simulation
had
the
unexpected
result
of
causing
her
actually
to
appreciate
his
point
of
view
which
was
very
curious
london
indeed
had
had
its
effect
on
hilda
she
had
seen
the
five
towns
from
a
distance
and
as
something
definitely
provincial
having
lived
for
years
at
brighton
which
is
almost
a
suburb
of
london
and
also
for
a
short
time
in
london
itself
she
could
not
think
of
herself
as
a
provincial
in
the
full
sense
in
which
edwin
for
example
was
a
provincial
she
had
gone
to
london
with
her
son
not
like
a
staring
and
intimidated
provincial
but
with
the
confidence
of
an
initiate
returning
to
the
scene
of
initiation
and
once
she
was
there
all
her
old
condescensions
towards
the
dirty
and
primitive
ingenuous
five
towns
had
very
quickly
revived
she
discovered
charlie
orgreave
the
fairly
successful
doctor
in
ealing
a
suburb
rich
in
doctors
to
be
the
perfect
londoner
and
janet
no
longer
useless
and
forlorn
scarcely
less
so
these
two
indeed
had
the
air
of
having
at
length
reached
their
proper
home
after
being
born
in
exile
the
same
was
true
of
johnnie
orgreave
now
safely
through
the
matrimonial
court
and
married
to
his
blonde
adela
formerly
the
ripping
chris
hamson
whose
money
had
bought
him
a
junior
partnership
in
an
important
architectural
firm
in
russell
square
johnnie
and
adela
had
come
over
from
bedford
park
to
ealing
to
see
hilda
and
hilda
had
dined
with
them
at
bedford
park
at
a
table
illuminated
by
a
repast
utterly
different
in
its
appointments
and
atmosphere
from
anything
conceivable
in
trafalgar
road
the
current
five
towns
notion
of
johnnie
and
his
wife
as
two
morally
ruined
creatures
hiding
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
shame
from
an
outraged
public
opinion
seemed
merely
comic
in
ealing
and
bedford
park
these
people
referred
to
the
five
towns
with
negligent
affection
but
with
disdain
as
to
a
community
that
with
all
its
good
qualities
had
not
yet
emerged
from
barbarism
they
assumed
that
their
attitude
was
also
hilda
s
and
hilda
after
a
moment
s
secret
resentment
had
indeed
made
their
attitude
her
own
when
she
mentioned
that
she
hoped
soon
to
move
edwin
into
a
country
house
they
applauded
and
implied
that
no
other
course
was
possible
withal
their
respect
to
say
nothing
of
their
regard
for
edwin
the
astute
and
successful
man
of
business
was
obvious
and
genuine
the
two
brothers
orgreave
amid
their
possibly
superficial
splendours
of
professional
men
hinted
envy
of
the
stability
of
edwin
s
trade
position
and
both
janet
and
adela
shopping
with
hilda
showed
her
by
those
inflections
and
of
which
women
possess
the
secret
that
the
wife
of
a
solid
and
generous
husband
had
quite
as
much
economic
importance
in
london
as
in
the
five
towns
thus
when
hilda
got
into
the
train
at
euston
she
had
in
her
head
a
plan
of
campaign
compared
to
which
the
schemes
entertained
by
her
on
the
afternoon
of
the
disastrous
servants
episode
seemed
amateurish
and
incomplete
and
also
she
was
like
a
returning
adventurer
carrying
back
to
his
savage
land
the
sacred
torch
of
civilisation
she
had
perceived
as
never
before
the
superior
value
of
the
suave
and
refined
social
methods
of
the
metropolitan
compared
with
the
manners
of
the
five
towns
and
it
seemed
to
her
in
her
new
enthusiasm
for
the
art
of
life
that
if
she
had
ever
had
a
difficulty
with
edwin
her
own
clumsiness
was
to
blame
she
saw
edwin
as
an
instrument
to
be
played
upon
and
herself
as
a
virtuoso
in
such
an
attitude
was
necessarily
a
condescension
yet
this
condescension
somehow
did
not
in
the
least
affect
the
tenderness
and
the
fever
of
her
longing
for
edwin
her
excitement
grew
as
the
train
passed
across
the
dusky
december
plain
towards
him
she
thought
of
the
honesty
of
his
handshake
and
of
his
wistful
glance
she
knew
that
he
was
better
than
any
of
the
people
she
had
left
either
more
capable
or
more
reliable
or
more
charitable
or
all
three
she
knew
that
most
of
the
people
she
had
left
were
at
heart
snobs
am
i
getting
a
snob
she
asked
herself
she
had
asked
herself
the
question
before
i
don
t
care
if
it
is
snobbishness
i
want
certain
things
and
i
will
have
them
and
they
can
call
it
what
they
like
like
the
majority
of
women
she
was
incapable
of
being
frightened
by
the
names
of
her
desires
she
might
be
snobbish
in
one
part
of
her
but
in
another
she
had
the
fiercest
scorn
for
all
that
ealing
stood
for
and
in
edwin
she
admired
nothing
more
than
the
fact
that
success
had
not
modified
his
politics
which
were
as
downright
as
they
had
ever
been
she
could
not
honestly
say
the
same
for
herself
and
assuredly
the
orgreaves
could
not
say
the
same
for
themselves
in
politics
edwin
was
an
inspiration
to
her
and
when
the
train
entered
the
fiery
zone
of
industry
and
slackened
speed
amid
the
squalid
twilit
streets
and
stopped
at
knype
station
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
local
lowering
faces
and
mackintoshed
and
gaitered
forms
and
the
damp
chill
of
the
five
towns
came
in
through
the
opened
door
of
the
compartment
her
heart
fell
and
she
regretted
the
elegance
of
ealing
but
simultaneously
her
heart
was
beating
with
ecstatic
expectation
she
saw
edwin
s
face
it
was
a
local
face
he
wore
mourning
he
saw
her
his
eye
lighted
his
wistful
smile
appeared
yes
she
thought
he
is
the
same
as
my
image
of
him
he
is
better
than
any
of
them
i
am
safe
what
a
shame
to
have
left
him
all
alone
he
was
quite
right
there
was
no
need
for
it
but
i
am
so
impulsive
he
must
have
suffered
terribly
with
those
benbows
and
shut
out
of
his
own
house
too
his
hand
thrilled
her
in
the
terrible
sincerity
and
outpouring
of
her
kiss
she
sought
to
compensate
him
for
all
wrongs
past
and
future
her
joy
in
being
near
him
again
made
her
tingle
his
calmness
pleased
her
she
thought
i
know
him
with
his
calmness
hello
kid
edwin
addressed
george
with
negligence
been
looking
after
your
mother
george
answered
like
a
londoner
she
had
them
side
by
side
it
was
the
fact
that
george
had
looked
after
her
london
had
matured
him
he
had
picked
up
a
little
ealing
he
was
past
edwin
s
shoulder
indeed
he
was
surprisingly
near
to
being
a
man
she
had
both
of
them
on
the
platform
they
surrounded
her
with
their
masculine
protection
george
s
secret
deep
respect
for
edwin
was
not
hidden
from
her
and
yet
all
the
time
in
her
joy
reliance
love
admiration
eating
him
with
her
eyes
she
was
condescending
to
edwin
because
she
had
plans
for
his
good
she
knew
better
than
he
did
what
would
be
for
his
good
and
he
was
a
provincial
and
didn
t
suspect
it
my
poor
boy
she
had
said
gleefully
in
the
cab
pulling
suddenly
at
a
loose
button
of
the
old
grey
coat
which
he
wore
surreptitiously
under
his
new
black
overcoat
my
poor
boy
what
a
state
you
are
in
implying
in
her
tone
of
affectionate
raillery
that
without
her
he
was
a
lost
man
through
this
loose
button
she
was
his
mother
his
good
angel
his
saviour
the
trifle
had
led
to
a
general
visitation
of
his
wardrobe
conducted
by
her
with
metropolitan
skill
in
humouring
his
susceptibilities
edwin
now
tried
on
the
new
with
the
that
none
but
an
odious
dandy
can
avoid
on
such
occasions
it
seems
warmer
than
it
used
to
be
he
said
pleased
to
have
her
beholding
him
and
interesting
herself
in
him
especially
in
his
office
her
presence
there
unless
it
happened
to
arouse
his
jealousy
for
his
business
independence
always
pleasurably
excited
him
her
muff
on
the
desk
had
the
air
of
being
the
muff
of
a
woman
who
was
amorously
interested
in
him
but
his
relations
with
whom
were
not
regularised
by
the
law
or
the
church
yes
said
she
i
ve
put
some
inside
the
lining
at
the
back
why
well
didn
t
you
say
you
felt
the
cold
from
the
window
and
it
s
bad
for
your
liver
her
glance
said
am
i
not
a
clever
woman
and
his
replied
you
are
that
s
the
end
of
that
i
hope
darling
she
remarked
picking
up
the
old
and
dropping
it
with
charming
affected
disgust
into
the
basket
he
shouted
for
the
clerk
who
entered
with
some
letters
for
signature
under
the
eyes
of
his
wife
edwin
signed
them
with
the
demeanour
of
a
secretary
of
state
signing
the
destiny
of
provinces
while
the
clerk
respectfully
waited
i
ve
asked
maggie
to
come
up
for
the
said
hilda
carelessly
when
they
were
alone
together
and
edwin
was
straightening
the
desk
preparatory
to
departure
since
her
return
she
had
become
far
more
friendly
with
maggie
than
ever
before
not
because
maggie
had
revealed
any
new
charm
but
because
she
saw
in
maggie
a
victim
of
injustice
nothing
during
the
week
had
more
severely
tested
hilda
s
new
methods
of
intercourse
with
edwin
than
the
disclosure
of
the
provisions
of
auntie
hamps
s
will
which
she
had
at
once
and
definitely
set
down
as
monstrous
she
simply
could
not
comprehend
edwin
s
calm
acceptance
of
them
and
a
month
earlier
she
would
have
been
bitter
about
it
it
was
not
she
was
convinced
that
she
coveted
money
but
that
she
hated
unfairness
why
should
the
benbows
have
all
auntie
hamps
s
possessions
and
edwin
and
maggie
who
had
done
a
thousand
times
more
for
her
than
the
benbows
nothing
hilda
s
conversation
implied
that
the
benbows
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
and
when
edwin
pointed
out
that
their
good
luck
was
not
their
fault
only
a
miracle
of
had
enabled
her
to
say
nicely
that
s
quite
true
instead
of
sneering
that
s
you
all
over
edwin
when
she
learnt
that
edwin
would
receive
not
a
penny
for
his
labours
as
executor
and
trustee
for
the
benbow
children
she
was
speechless
perceiving
that
he
did
not
care
for
her
to
discourse
upon
what
she
considered
to
be
the
wrong
done
to
him
she
discoursed
upon
the
wrong
done
to
maggie
maggie
who
was
already
being
deprived
by
the
wicked
albert
of
interest
due
to
her
and
edwin
had
to
agree
with
her
about
maggie
s
case
it
appeared
that
maggie
also
agreed
with
her
about
maggie
s
case
as
for
the
benbows
hilda
had
not
deigned
to
say
one
word
to
them
on
the
matter
a
look
a
tone
a
silence
had
sufficed
to
express
the
whole
of
hilda
s
mind
to
those
benbows
oh
said
edwin
so
maggie
s
coming
for
the
is
she
well
that
s
not
a
bad
scheme
he
knew
that
maggie
had
been
very
helpful
about
servants
and
that
the
second
servant
having
not
yet
arrived
she
would
certainly
do
much
more
work
in
the
house
than
she
made
he
pictured
her
and
hilda
becoming
still
more
intimate
as
they
turned
sheets
and
blankets
and
shook
pillows
on
opposite
sides
of
beds
and
he
was
glad
yes
said
hilda
i
ve
called
there
this
morning
and
what
s
she
doing
with
minnie
we
ve
settled
all
that
said
hilda
proudly
edwin
had
told
her
in
detail
the
whole
story
of
minnie
and
she
had
behaved
exactly
as
he
had
anticipated
her
championship
of
minnie
had
been
as
passionate
as
her
ruthless
verdict
upon
minnie
s
dead
mistress
the
girl
s
aunt
was
there
when
i
called
we
ve
settled
she
is
to
go
to
stone
and
maggie
and
i
shall
do
something
for
her
and
when
it
s
all
over
i
may
take
her
on
as
housemaid
maggie
says
she
probably
wouldn
t
make
a
bad
housemaid
anyhow
it
s
all
arranged
for
the
present
then
maggie
ll
be
without
a
servant
no
she
won
t
we
shall
manage
that
besides
i
suppose
maggie
won
t
stay
on
in
that
house
all
by
herself
for
ever
it
s
just
the
right
size
i
see
just
said
edwin
he
was
spreading
over
his
desk
a
with
a
red
scolloped
edging
which
hilda
had
presented
to
him
three
days
earlier
she
gazed
at
him
with
composed
and
justifiable
as
if
saying
leave
absolutely
to
me
everything
in
my
department
and
see
how
smooth
your
life
will
be
he
would
never
praise
her
and
she
had
a
very
healthy
appetite
for
praise
which
appetite
always
went
hungry
but
now
instead
of
resenting
his
niggardly
reserve
she
said
to
herself
poor
boy
he
can
t
bring
himself
to
pay
compliments
that
s
it
but
his
eyes
are
full
of
delicious
compliments
she
was
happy
even
if
apprehensive
for
the
immediate
future
there
she
was
established
and
respected
in
his
office
which
was
his
church
and
the
successful
rival
of
her
boudoir
her
plans
were
progressing
she
approached
the
real
business
of
her
call
i
was
thinking
we
might
have
gone
over
to
see
ingpen
this
afternoon
well
let
s
ingpen
convalescent
had
insisted
two
days
earlier
on
being
removed
to
his
own
house
near
the
village
of
stockbrook
a
few
miles
south
of
axe
the
departure
was
a
surprising
example
of
the
mere
power
of
volition
on
the
part
of
a
patient
the
routine
of
hospital
life
had
exasperated
the
recovering
soul
of
this
priest
of
freedom
to
such
a
point
that
doctor
matron
and
friends
had
had
to
yield
to
a
mere
instinct
there
s
no
decent
train
to
go
and
none
at
all
to
come
back
until
nearly
nine
o
clock
and
we
can
t
cycle
in
this
weather
at
least
i
can
t
especially
in
the
dark
well
what
about
sunday
the
sunday
trains
are
worse
what
a
ghastly
line
said
edwin
and
they
have
the
cheek
to
pay
five
per
cent
i
remember
ingpen
telling
me
there
was
one
fairish
train
into
knype
in
the
morning
and
one
out
in
the
afternoon
and
there
wouldn
t
be
that
if
the
locomotive
superintendent
didn
t
happen
to
live
at
axe
it
s
a
pity
you
haven
t
got
a
isn
t
it
said
hilda
lightly
smiling
because
then
we
could
use
the
works
horse
now
and
then
and
it
wouldn
t
really
cost
anything
extra
would
it
her
heart
was
beating
perceptibly
edwin
shook
his
head
agreeably
but
with
firmness
can
t
mix
up
two
different
things
like
that
he
said
she
knew
it
she
was
aware
of
the
whole
theory
of
among
the
upper
in
the
five
towns
a
butcher
might
use
his
cob
for
pleasure
on
sundays
he
never
used
it
for
pleasure
on
any
other
day
but
traders
on
a
higher
plane
than
butchers
drew
between
the
works
and
the
house
a
line
which
a
works
horse
was
not
permitted
to
cross
one
or
two
perhaps
but
not
the
most
solid
would
put
a
carter
into
a
livery
overcoat
and
a
shabby
and
describe
him
as
a
coachman
while
on
rare
afternoons
he
drove
a
landau
or
a
victoria
picked
up
cheap
at
axe
or
market
drayton
but
the
majority
had
no
pretensions
to
the
owning
of
private
carriages
the
community
was
not
in
fact
a
carriage
community
even
the
orgreaves
had
never
dreamed
of
a
carriage
old
darius
clayhanger
would
have
been
staggered
into
profanity
by
the
suggestion
of
such
a
thing
indeed
until
some
time
after
old
clayhanger
s
death
the
printing
business
had
been
content
to
deliver
all
its
orders
in
a
handcart
only
when
edwin
discovered
that
for
instance
two
thousand
catalogues
on
faced
clay
paper
could
not
be
respectably
delivered
in
a
handcart
had
he
steeled
himself
to
the
prodigious
move
of
setting
up
a
stable
he
had
found
an
entirely
trustworthy
with
the
comfortable
name
of
unchpin
and
an
animal
and
a
tradesman
s
covered
cart
having
been
bought
he
had
left
the
affair
to
unchpin
naturally
he
had
never
essayed
to
drive
the
tradesman
s
cart
and
edwin
clayhanger
could
not
be
seen
on
the
insecure
box
of
a
tradesman
s
cart
he
had
learnt
nothing
about
horses
except
that
a
horse
should
be
watered
before
and
not
after
being
fed
that
shoeing
cost
a
shilling
a
week
and
fodder
a
shilling
a
day
and
that
a
horse
driven
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
a
week
was
likely
to
get
a
bit
over
at
the
knees
at
home
the
horse
and
cart
had
always
been
regarded
as
being
just
as
exclusively
a
works
item
as
the
or
the
i
suppose
said
hilda
carefully
you
ve
got
all
the
work
one
horse
can
do
and
more
well
then
why
don
t
you
buy
another
one
she
tried
to
speak
carelessly
without
genuine
interest
yes
no
doubt
edwin
answered
drily
and
build
fresh
stables
too
haven
t
you
got
room
for
two
come
along
and
look
and
then
perhaps
you
ll
be
satisfied
buzzers
syrens
and
whistles
began
to
sound
in
the
neighbourhood
it
was
one
o
clock
shall
i
your
overcoat
collar
s
turned
up
behind
let
me
do
it
she
straightened
the
collar
they
went
out
through
the
clerk
s
office
edwin
gave
a
sideways
nod
to
simpson
in
the
passage
some
girls
and
a
few
men
were
already
hurrying
forth
none
of
them
took
notice
of
edwin
and
hilda
they
all
plunged
for
the
street
as
though
the
works
had
been
on
fire
they
are
in
a
hurry
my
word
hilda
murmured
with
irony
and
why
shouldn
t
they
be
the
employer
protested
almost
angrily
in
the
small
yard
stood
the
horseless
cart
with
edwin
clayhanger
lithographer
and
steam
printer
bursley
on
both
its
sides
the
stable
and
were
in
one
penthouse
and
to
get
to
the
stable
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
unchpin
a
fat
man
of
forty
with
a
face
marked
by
black
seams
was
bending
over
a
in
the
he
ignored
the
intruders
the
stable
consisted
of
one
large
in
which
a
grey
animal
was
restlessly
moving
you
see
edwin
muttered
curtly
oh
what
a
beautiful
horse
i
ve
never
seen
him
before
her
edwin
corrected
is
it
a
mare
so
they
say
i
never
knew
you
d
got
a
fresh
one
i
haven
t
yet
i
ve
taken
this
one
for
a
fortnight
s
trial
from
chawner
how
s
she
doing
unchpin
he
called
to
the
unchpin
looked
round
and
stared
bit
light
he
growled
and
turned
back
to
the
which
he
seemed
to
be
repairing
i
thought
so
said
edwin
but
her
s
a
good
un
he
added
but
where
s
the
old
horse
asked
hilda
with
god
edwin
replied
dropped
down
dead
last
week
what
of
edwin
shook
his
head
it
s
a
privilege
of
horses
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
he
said
they
re
always
doing
it
you
never
told
me
well
you
weren
t
here
for
one
thing
the
mare
inquisitively
but
cautiously
put
her
muzzle
over
the
door
of
the
box
hilda
stroked
her
the
animal
s
mysterious
eyes
her
beautiful
coat
her
broad
back
her
general
bigness
relatively
to
hilda
the
sound
of
her
feet
among
the
litter
on
the
paving
stones
the
smell
of
the
stable
these
things
enchanted
hilda
i
should
adore
horses
she
breathed
half
to
herself
ecstatically
and
wondered
whether
she
would
ever
be
able
to
work
her
will
on
edwin
in
the
matter
of
a
she
pictured
herself
driving
the
grey
mare
who
had
learnt
to
love
her
in
a
flashing
edwin
by
her
side
on
the
her
mind
went
back
enviously
to
tavy
mansion
and
dartmoor
but
she
felt
that
edwin
had
not
enough
elasticity
to
comprehend
the
rapture
of
her
dream
she
foresaw
nearly
endless
trouble
and
altercation
and
chicane
before
she
could
achieve
her
end
she
was
ready
to
despair
but
she
remembered
her
resolutions
and
took
heart
i
say
unchpin
said
edwin
i
suppose
this
box
couldn
t
be
made
into
two
stalls
unchpin
on
his
gaitered
legs
clumped
towards
the
stable
and
gazed
gloomily
into
the
box
when
he
had
gazed
for
some
time
he
touched
his
cap
to
hilda
it
could
he
announced
could
you
get
a
trap
into
the
shed
as
well
as
the
cart
ay
if
ye
dropped
th
shafts
o
th
trap
under
th
cart
what
of
it
mester
nothing
only
missis
is
going
to
have
this
mare
after
a
pause
unchpin
muttered
missis
eh
hilda
had
moved
a
little
away
into
the
yard
edwin
approached
her
flushing
slightly
and
with
a
which
he
tried
to
dissipate
with
one
wink
hilda
s
face
was
set
hard
i
must
just
go
back
to
the
office
she
said
in
a
queer
voice
she
walked
quickly
edwin
following
simpson
beheld
their
return
with
gentle
surprise
in
the
private
office
hilda
shut
the
door
she
then
ran
to
the
puzzled
edwin
and
kissed
him
with
the
most
startling
vehemence
clasping
her
arms
in
one
hand
she
still
held
the
muff
round
his
neck
she
loved
him
for
being
exactly
as
he
was
she
preferred
his
strange
uncouth
method
of
granting
a
request
of
yielding
of
flattering
her
caprice
to
any
politer
more
conventional
methods
of
the
metropolis
she
thought
that
no
other
man
could
be
as
deeply
romantic
as
edwin
she
despised
herself
for
ever
having
been
misled
by
the
surface
of
him
and
even
the
surface
of
him
she
saw
now
as
it
were
through
the
prism
of
passionate
affection
to
be
edged
with
the
blending
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
when
they
came
again
out
of
the
office
after
the
sacred
rite
and
edwin
as
uplifted
as
she
glanced
back
nevertheless
at
the
sheeted
desk
and
the
safe
and
the
other
objects
in
the
room
with
the
habitual
solicitude
of
a
man
from
whom
the
weight
of
responsibility
is
never
lifted
she
felt
saddened
because
she
could
not
enter
utterly
into
his
impenetrable
soul
and
live
through
all
his
emotions
and
comprehend
like
a
creator
the
always
baffling
wistfulness
of
his
eyes
this
sadness
was
joy
it
was
the
aura
of
her
tremendous
satisfaction
in
his
individuality
and
in
her
triumph
and
in
the
thought
i
alone
stand
between
him
and
desolation
ii
wo
exclaimed
hilda
broadly
bringing
the
mare
and
the
vehicle
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
the
live
and
let
live
inn
in
the
main
street
of
the
village
of
stockbrook
which
lay
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
the
high
road
from
the
five
towns
to
axe
and
immediately
the
mare
stopped
she
was
enveloped
in
her
own
vapour
ha
exclaimed
edwin
with
faint
benevolent
irony
and
no
bones
broken
a
man
came
out
from
the
the
village
of
stockbrook
gave
the
illusion
that
hundreds
of
english
villages
were
giving
that
christmas
morning
the
illusion
that
its
name
was
arcadia
that
finality
had
been
reached
and
that
the
forces
of
civilisation
could
go
no
further
more
suave
than
a
dutch
village
incomparably
neater
and
cleaner
and
more
delicately
finished
than
a
french
village
it
presented
in
the
still
complacent
atmosphere
of
long
tradition
a
picturesque
medley
of
tiny
architectures
nearly
every
aspect
of
which
was
beautiful
and
if
seven
people
of
different
ages
and
sexes
lived
in
a
cottage
under
a
thatched
roof
hollowed
by
the
weight
of
years
without
drains
and
without
water
and
also
without
freedom
the
beholder
was
yet
bound
to
conclude
that
by
some
mysterious
virtue
their
existence
must
be
gracious
happy
and
in
fact
ideal
especially
on
christmas
day
though
christmas
day
was
also
quarter
day
and
that
they
would
not
on
any
account
have
it
altered
in
the
slightest
degree
who
could
believe
that
fathers
of
families
drank
away
their
children
s
bread
in
the
quaint
of
that
hostel
a
fit
to
produce
ecstasy
in
the
heart
of
every
american
traveller
the
live
and
let
live
who
could
have
believed
that
the
wesleyan
methodists
already
singing
a
christmas
hymn
inside
the
dwarf
georgian
conventicle
and
their
straggling
under
the
lych
into
the
scorned
one
another
with
an
immortal
detestation
each
claiming
a
monopoly
in
knowledge
of
the
unknowable
but
after
all
the
illusion
of
arcadia
was
not
entirely
an
illusion
in
this
calm
village
with
its
motionless
trees
enchanted
beneath
a
vast
grey
impenetrable
cloud
a
sort
of
relative
finality
had
indeed
been
reached
the
end
of
an
epoch
that
was
awaiting
dissolution
edwin
had
not
easily
agreed
to
the
project
of
shutting
up
house
for
the
day
and
eating
the
christmas
dinner
with
tertius
ingpen
although
customarily
regarding
the
ritual
of
christmas
with
its
family
visits
its
exchange
of
presents
its
feverish
kitchen
activity
its
somewhat
insincere
gaiety
its
hours
of
boredom
and
its
stomachic
regrets
as
an
ordeal
rather
than
a
delight
he
nevertheless
abandoned
it
with
reluctance
and
a
sense
of
being
disloyal
to
something
sacred
but
the
situation
of
ingpen
hilda
s
strong
desire
and
her
teasing
promise
of
a
surprise
and
the
still
continuing
dearth
of
servants
had
been
good
arguments
to
persuade
him
and
though
he
had
left
trafalgar
road
moody
and
captious
thinking
all
the
time
of
the
deserted
and
cold
home
he
had
arrived
in
stockbrook
tingling
and
happy
and
proud
of
hilda
proud
of
her
verve
her
persistency
and
her
success
she
had
carried
him
very
far
on
the
wave
of
her
new
enthusiasm
for
she
had
beguiled
him
into
immediately
spending
mighty
sums
on
a
new
harness
rugs
a
and
a
fancy
whip
she
had
exhausted
unchpin
upset
the
routine
of
the
lithographic
business
and
gravely
overworked
the
mare
in
her
determination
to
learn
to
drive
she
had
had
the
equipage
out
at
night
for
her
lessons
on
the
other
hand
she
had
not
in
the
least
troubled
herself
about
the
purchase
of
a
second
horse
for
mercantile
purposes
and
a
second
horse
had
not
yet
been
bought
when
she
had
announced
that
she
would
herself
drive
her
husband
and
son
over
to
stockbrook
edwin
had
absolutely
negatived
the
idea
but
unchpin
had
been
on
her
side
she
had
done
the
double
journey
with
unchpin
who
judged
her
capable
and
the
mare
eight
years
old
quite
reliable
and
who
moreover
wanted
christmas
as
much
as
possible
to
himself
and
hilda
had
triumphed
walking
the
mare
uphill
and
also
downhill
she
had
achieved
stockbrook
in
safety
and
the
conquering
air
with
which
she
drew
up
at
the
live
and
let
live
was
delicious
the
chit
s
happiness
and
pride
radiated
out
from
her
it
seemed
to
edwin
that
by
the
mere
strength
of
violition
she
had
actually
created
the
and
its
appointments
and
the
mare
too
and
he
thought
that
he
himself
had
not
lived
in
vain
if
he
could
procure
her
such
sensations
as
her
glowing
face
then
displayed
her
occasionally
overbearing
tenacity
and
the
little
jars
which
good
resolutions
several
weeks
old
had
naturally
not
been
powerful
enough
to
prevent
were
forgotten
and
forgiven
he
would
have
given
all
his
savings
to
please
her
caprice
and
been
glad
a
horse
and
trap
or
even
a
pair
of
horses
and
a
landau
were
a
trifling
price
to
pay
for
her
girlish
joy
and
for
his
own
tranquillity
in
his
beloved
house
and
business
catch
me
both
of
you
cried
hilda
edwin
had
got
down
and
walked
round
behind
the
vehicle
to
the
footpath
where
george
stood
grinning
the
stableman
in
classic
attitude
was
at
the
mare
s
head
hilda
jumped
rather
wildly
it
was
edwin
who
countered
the
shock
of
her
descent
the
edge
of
her
velvet
hat
knocked
against
his
forehead
disarranging
his
cap
he
could
smell
the
velvet
as
for
an
instant
he
held
his
wife
strangely
acquiescent
and
yielding
in
his
arms
and
there
was
something
intimately
feminine
in
the
faint
odour
all
hilda
s
happiness
seemed
to
pass
into
him
and
that
felicity
sufficed
for
him
he
did
not
desire
any
happiness
personal
to
himself
he
wanted
only
to
live
in
her
his
contentment
was
profound
complete
rapturous
and
yet
in
the
same
moment
reflecting
that
hilda
would
certainly
have
neglected
the
of
the
mare
he
could
say
to
the
stableman
put
the
rug
over
her
will
you
hello
here
s
mr
ingpen
announced
george
as
he
threw
the
coloured
rug
on
the
mare
ingpen
pale
and
thickly
enveloped
came
slowly
round
the
bend
of
the
road
waving
and
smiling
he
had
had
a
relapse
after
a
too
early
sortie
and
was
recovering
from
it
i
made
sure
you
d
be
about
here
he
said
shaking
hands
merry
christmas
all
ought
you
to
be
out
my
lad
edwin
asked
heartily
out
yes
i
m
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
and
i
ve
been
ordered
mild
exercise
he
squared
off
gaily
against
george
and
hit
the
stout
adolescent
in
the
chest
what
about
all
your
parcels
hilda
edwin
enquired
oh
we
ll
call
for
them
afterwards
afterwards
yes
come
along
before
you
catch
a
chill
she
winked
openly
at
ingpen
who
returned
the
wink
come
along
dear
it
s
not
far
we
have
to
walk
across
the
fields
put
her
up
sir
the
stableman
demanded
of
edwin
yes
and
give
her
a
bit
of
a
rub
down
he
replied
absently
remembering
various
references
of
hilda
s
to
a
surprise
his
heart
misgave
him
ingpen
and
hilda
looked
like
plotters
very
intimate
and
mischievous
he
had
a
notion
that
living
with
a
woman
was
comparable
to
living
with
a
volcano
you
never
knew
when
a
dangerous
eruption
might
not
occur
within
three
minutes
the
first
and
minor
catastrophe
had
occurred
bit
sticky
this
field
path
of
yours
said
edwin
uneasily
they
were
all
four
slithering
about
in
brown
clay
under
a
ragged
hedge
in
which
a
few
red
berries
glowed
it
was
as
hard
as
iron
the
day
before
yesterday
said
hilda
oh
so
you
were
here
the
day
before
yesterday
were
you
what
s
that
house
there
edwin
turned
to
ingpen
he
s
guessed
it
in
one
ingpen
murmured
and
then
went
off
into
his
characteristic
crescendo
laugh
the
upper
part
of
a
late
house
squat
and
square
with
yellow
walls
black
uncurtained
windows
high
slim
chimney
and
a
blue
slate
roof
showed
like
a
gigantic
and
mysterious
fruit
in
a
clump
of
variegated
trees
some
of
which
were
evergreen
ladderedge
hall
my
boy
said
ingpen
seat
of
the
beechinors
for
about
a
hundred
years
seat
eh
edwin
murmured
sarcastically
it
s
been
empty
for
two
years
remarked
hilda
brightly
so
we
thought
we
d
have
a
look
at
it
and
edwin
said
to
himself
that
he
had
divined
all
along
what
the
surprise
was
it
was
astounding
that
a
man
could
pass
with
such
rapidity
as
edwin
from
vivid
joy
to
black
and
desolate
gloom
she
well
knew
that
the
idea
of
living
in
the
country
was
extremely
repugnant
to
him
and
that
nothing
would
ever
induce
him
to
consent
to
it
and
yet
she
must
needs
lay
this
trap
for
him
prepare
this
infantile
surprise
and
thereby
spoil
his
christmas
she
who
a
few
moments
earlier
had
been
the
embodiment
of
surrender
in
his
arms
he
said
no
word
he
hummed
a
few
notes
and
glanced
airily
to
right
and
left
with
an
effort
after
unconcern
the
presence
of
ingpen
and
the
boy
and
the
fact
of
christmas
forbade
him
to
speak
freely
he
could
not
suddenly
stop
and
drive
his
stick
into
the
earth
and
say
savagely
now
listen
to
me
once
for
all
i
won
t
have
this
country
house
idea
so
let
it
be
understood
if
you
want
a
row
you
know
how
to
get
it
the
appearance
of
amity
and
the
more
the
better
must
be
kept
up
throughout
the
day
nevertheless
in
his
heart
he
challenged
hilda
desperately
all
her
good
qualities
became
insignificant
all
his
benevolent
estimates
of
her
seemed
ridiculous
she
was
the
impossible
woman
he
saw
a
tremendous
vista
of
unpleasantness
for
her
obstinacy
in
warfare
was
known
to
him
together
with
her
perfect
lack
of
scruple
of
commonsense
and
of
social
decency
he
had
made
her
a
present
of
a
horse
and
trap
solely
to
please
her
and
this
was
his
reward
the
more
rope
you
gave
these
creatures
the
more
they
wanted
but
he
would
give
no
more
rope
compromise
was
at
an
end
the
battle
would
be
joined
that
night
in
his
grim
and
resolute
dejection
there
was
something
almost
voluptuous
he
continued
to
glance
airily
about
and
at
intervals
to
hum
a
few
notes
over
a
stile
they
dropped
into
a
rutty
and
opposite
was
the
worn
iron
gate
of
ladderedge
hall
with
a
s
board
on
it
a
short
curved
gravel
drive
filmed
with
green
led
to
the
of
the
house
in
front
were
a
lawn
and
a
beyond
a
paddock
and
behind
a
vegetable
garden
and
a
glimpse
of
stabling
a
compact
property
ingpen
drew
a
great
key
from
his
pocket
the
plotters
were
all
prepared
they
took
their
victim
for
a
simpleton
a
ninny
a
lamb
in
the
damp
echoing
interior
edwin
gazed
without
seeing
and
heard
as
in
a
dream
without
listening
this
was
the
hall
this
the
this
the
this
the
white
marble
mantelpieces
grates
hanging
in
strips
cobwebs
uneven
floors
scaly
ceilings
the
invisible
vapour
of
human
memories
this
was
the
kitchen
enormous
then
the
larder
enormous
and
the
scullery
still
more
enormous
with
a
flanking
the
slopstone
no
water
no
gas
and
what
was
this
room
opening
out
of
the
kitchen
oh
that
must
be
the
servants
hall
servants
hall
indeed
imagine
edwin
clayhanger
living
in
a
hall
with
a
servants
hall
therein
snobbishness
unthinkable
he
would
not
be
able
to
look
his
friends
in
the
face
on
the
first
floor
endless
bedrooms
but
no
here
though
was
a
small
bedroom
that
would
make
a
splendid
ingpen
the
ever
expert
conceived
a
in
the
roof
and
traced
routes
for
plumbers
pipes
george
excited
and
comprehending
that
he
must
conduct
himself
as
behoved
an
architect
ran
up
to
the
attic
floor
to
study
on
the
spot
the
problem
of
the
and
ingpen
followed
edwin
stared
out
of
a
window
at
the
prospect
of
the
arcadian
village
lying
a
little
below
across
the
sloping
fields
come
along
edwin
hilda
coaxed
yes
she
had
pretended
a
deep
concern
for
the
welfare
of
the
suffering
feckless
bachelor
tertius
ingpen
she
had
paid
visit
after
visit
in
order
to
watch
over
his
convalescence
choosing
to
ignore
his
scorn
for
all
her
sex
she
had
grown
more
friendly
with
him
than
even
edwin
had
ever
been
indeed
by
her
sympathetic
attentions
she
had
made
edwin
seem
callous
in
comparison
and
all
the
time
she
had
merely
been
pursuing
a
private
design
with
what
girlish
deceitfulness
in
the
emptiness
of
the
house
the
voices
of
ingpen
and
george
echoed
from
above
down
the
second
flight
of
stairs
no
good
going
to
the
attics
muttered
edwin
on
the
landing
hilda
half
cajoling
half
fretful
protested
now
edwin
don
t
be
disagreeable
he
followed
her
on
high
martyrised
the
front
wall
of
the
house
rose
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
attic
windows
screening
and
darkening
them
cheerful
view
edwin
growled
he
heard
ingpen
saying
that
the
place
could
be
had
on
a
repairing
lease
for
pounds
a
year
and
that
perhaps
would
buy
it
dirt
cheap
ah
edwin
murmured
i
know
those
repairing
leases
wouldn
t
make
this
barn
fit
to
live
in
he
knew
that
ingpen
and
hilda
exchanged
glances
it
s
larger
than
tavy
mansion
said
hilda
tavy
mansion
there
was
the
secret
tavy
mansion
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
scheme
alicia
hesketh
had
a
fine
house
and
hilda
must
have
a
finer
she
hilda
of
all
people
was
a
snob
he
had
long
suspected
it
he
rejoined
sharply
of
course
it
isn
t
larger
than
tavy
mansion
it
isn
t
as
large
oh
edwin
how
can
you
say
such
things
in
the
portico
as
ingpen
was
the
door
the
husband
said
negligently
superiorly
cheerfully
it
s
not
so
bad
i
expect
there
s
hundreds
of
places
like
this
up
and
down
the
country
going
cheap
the
walk
back
to
the
live
and
let
live
was
irked
by
constraint
against
which
everyone
fought
nobly
smiling
laughing
making
remarks
about
cockrobins
the
sky
the
christmas
dinner
so
i
hear
it
s
settled
you
re
going
to
london
when
you
leave
school
kiddie
said
tertius
ingpen
to
bridge
over
a
fearful
hiatus
in
the
george
so
big
now
and
so
mannishly
dressed
as
to
be
amused
and
not
a
bit
hurt
by
the
appellation
kiddie
confirmed
the
statement
in
his
deepening
voice
edwin
thought
it
s
more
than
hear
anyway
hilda
had
told
him
that
during
the
visit
to
london
the
project
for
articling
george
to
johnnie
orgreave
had
been
revived
but
she
had
not
said
that
a
decision
had
been
taken
though
edwin
from
careful
pride
had
not
spoken
freely
george
being
hilda
s
affair
and
not
his
he
had
shown
no
enthusiasm
johnnie
orgreave
had
sunk
permanently
in
his
esteem
scarcely
less
so
than
jimmie
whose
conjugal
eccentricities
had
scandalised
the
five
towns
and
were
achieving
the
ruin
of
the
orgreave
practice
or
than
tom
who
was
developing
into
a
miser
moreover
he
did
not
at
all
care
for
george
going
to
london
why
should
it
be
thought
necessary
for
george
to
go
to
london
the
sagacious
and
successful
provincial
in
edwin
was
darkly
jealous
of
london
as
a
rival
superficial
and
brilliant
and
now
he
learnt
from
ingpen
that
george
s
destiny
was
fixed
a
matter
of
small
importance
however
did
they
seriously
expect
him
to
travel
from
ladderedge
hall
to
his
works
and
from
his
works
to
ladderedge
hall
every
of
his
life
he
laughed
sardonically
to
himself
out
came
the
sun
which
george
greeted
with
a
cheer
and
edwin
to
his
own
surprise
began
to
feel
hungry
iii
i
shan
t
take
that
house
you
know
said
edwin
casually
and
yet
confidentially
in
a
pause
which
followed
a
long
analysis
by
ingpen
of
ingpen
s
sensations
in
hospital
before
he
was
out
of
danger
they
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
a
splendid
extravagant
fire
in
ingpen
s
ingpen
sprawling
in
a
shabby
uncomfortable
easychair
and
flushed
with
the
activity
of
digestion
raised
his
eyebrows
squinted
down
at
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
and
answered
impartially
no
so
i
gather
of
course
you
must
understand
it
was
hilda
s
plan
to
go
up
there
i
merely
fell
in
with
it
simplest
thing
to
do
in
these
cases
certainly
thus
they
both
condescended
to
the
capricious
woman
dismissed
her
and
felt
a
marked
access
of
sincere
intimacy
on
a
plane
of
civilisation
exclusively
masculine
in
the
succeeding
silence
of
satisfaction
and
relief
could
be
heard
george
in
the
above
practising
again
the
piano
part
of
a
haydn
violin
sonata
which
he
had
very
nervously
tried
over
with
ingpen
while
they
were
awaiting
dinner
ingpen
said
suddenly
i
say
old
chap
why
have
you
never
mentioned
that
you
happened
to
meet
a
certain
person
in
my
room
at
hanbridge
that
night
you
went
over
there
for
me
he
frowned
edwin
had
a
thrill
pleasurable
and
apprehensive
at
the
prospect
of
a
supreme
confidence
it
was
no
earthly
business
of
mine
he
answered
lightly
but
his
tone
conveyed
you
surely
ought
to
be
aware
that
my
loyalty
and
my
discretion
are
complete
and
ingpen
replying
to
edwin
s
tone
said
with
a
simple
directness
that
flattered
edwin
to
the
heart
naturally
i
knew
i
was
quite
safe
in
your
hands
i
ve
reassured
the
lady
ingpen
smiled
slightly
edwin
was
too
proud
to
tell
ingpen
that
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
hilda
and
ingpen
was
too
proud
to
tell
edwin
that
he
assumed
as
much
at
that
moment
hilda
came
into
the
room
murmuring
a
carol
that
some
children
of
stockbrook
had
sung
on
the
doorstep
during
dinner
don
t
be
afraid
i
m
not
going
to
interrupt
i
know
you
re
in
the
thick
of
it
said
she
archly
not
guessing
how
exactly
truthful
she
was
ingpen
keeping
his
presence
of
mind
in
the
most
admirable
manner
rejoined
with
irony
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
ve
finished
already
explaining
to
dummer
how
she
ought
to
run
my
house
for
me
how
soon
do
you
mean
to
have
this
table
cleared
asked
hilda
the
christmas
dinner
served
by
a
raw
girl
in
a
large
pinafore
temporarily
hired
to
assist
dummer
the
housekeeper
had
been
a
good
one
its
only
real
fault
was
that
it
had
had
a
little
too
much
the
air
of
being
a
special
and
mighty
effort
and
although
it
owed
something
to
hilda
s
parcels
ingpen
was
justified
in
the
which
he
did
not
quite
conceal
as
a
bachelor
host
but
now
under
hilda
s
quizzing
gaze
not
merely
the
table
but
the
room
and
the
house
sank
to
the
the
coarse
imperfections
of
the
linen
and
the
cutlery
grew
very
apparent
the
disorder
of
bottles
and
glasses
and
cups
recalled
the
refectory
of
an
inferior
club
and
the
untidiness
of
the
room
heaped
with
accumulations
of
newspapers
magazines
documents
books
boxes
and
cases
loudly
accused
the
solitary
despot
whose
daily
caprices
of
arrangement
were
perpetuated
and
rendered
sacred
by
the
ukase
that
nothing
was
to
be
disturbed
hilda
s
glinting
eyes
seemed
to
challenge
each
corner
and
dark
place
to
confess
its
shameful
dirt
and
the
malicious
poise
of
her
head
mysteriously
communicated
the
fact
that
in
the
past
fortnight
she
had
spied
out
every
sinister
secret
in
the
whole
graceless
primitive
wigwam
this
table
retorted
ingpen
bravely
is
going
to
be
cleared
when
it
won
t
disturb
me
to
have
it
cleared
all
right
said
hilda
but
dummer
does
want
to
get
on
with
her
look
here
madam
ingpen
replied
you
re
a
little
ray
of
sunshine
and
all
that
and
i
m
the
first
to
say
so
but
i
m
not
your
husband
he
made
a
warning
gesture
now
don
t
say
you
d
be
sorry
for
any
woman
i
was
the
husband
of
think
of
something
more
original
he
burst
out
laughing
hilda
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
fading
day
please
i
only
popped
in
to
say
it
s
nearly
a
quarter
to
three
and
george
and
i
will
go
down
to
the
inn
and
bring
the
up
here
i
want
a
little
walk
we
shan
t
get
home
till
dark
as
it
is
oh
chance
it
and
stop
for
tea
and
all
will
be
forgiven
drive
home
in
the
dark
not
much
edwin
murmured
he
s
afraid
of
my
driving
said
hilda
when
edwin
and
ingpen
were
alone
together
once
more
ingpen
s
expression
changed
back
instantly
to
that
which
hilda
had
disturbed
and
edwin
s
impatience
which
had
uneasily
simmered
during
the
interruption
began
to
boil
her
husband
s
in
a
lunatic
asylum
i
may
tell
you
said
ingpen
whose
the
young
woman
s
in
question
for
edwin
it
was
as
if
a
door
had
opened
in
a
wall
and
disclosed
a
vast
unsuspected
garden
of
romance
really
yes
my
boy
ingpen
went
on
quietly
with
restraint
but
not
without
a
naïve
and
healthy
pride
in
the
sudden
display
of
the
marvellous
garden
and
i
didn
t
meet
her
at
a
concert
or
on
the
grand
canal
or
anything
of
that
sort
i
met
her
in
a
mill
at
oldham
while
i
was
doing
my
job
he
was
the
boss
of
the
mill
i
walked
into
an
office
and
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
on
the
flat
of
his
back
and
she
was
wiping
her
feet
on
his
chest
he
was
saying
in
a
very
anxious
tone
you
aren
t
half
wiping
them
harder
harder
that
was
his
little
weakness
you
see
he
happened
to
be
convinced
that
he
was
a
doormat
she
had
been
hiding
the
thing
for
weeks
coming
with
him
to
the
works
and
so
on
to
calm
him
ingpen
spoke
more
quickly
and
excitedly
i
never
saw
a
more
awful
thing
in
my
life
i
never
saw
a
more
awful
thing
in
my
life
and
coming
across
it
suddenly
you
see
there
was
something
absolutely
odious
in
him
lying
down
like
that
and
her
trying
to
soothe
him
in
the
way
he
wanted
you
should
have
seen
the
serious
expression
of
his
face
simply
bursting
with
anxiety
for
her
to
wipe
her
boots
properly
on
him
and
her
face
when
she
caught
sight
of
me
oh
dreadful
dreadful
ingpen
paused
and
then
continued
calmly
of
course
i
soon
tumbled
to
it
for
the
matter
of
that
it
didn
t
want
much
tumbling
to
he
went
raving
mad
the
same
afternoon
and
he
s
been
more
or
less
raving
mad
ever
since
what
a
ghastly
business
any
children
no
thank
god
ingpen
answered
with
fresh
emotion
but
don
t
you
forget
that
she
s
still
the
wife
of
that
lunatic
and
he
ll
probably
live
for
ever
she
s
tied
up
to
him
just
as
if
she
was
tied
up
to
a
post
those
are
our
divorce
laws
isn
t
it
appalling
isn
t
it
inconceivable
just
think
of
the
situation
of
that
woman
ingpen
positively
glared
at
edwin
in
the
intensity
of
his
indignation
awful
edwin
murmured
quite
alone
in
the
world
you
know
said
ingpen
i
m
hanged
if
i
know
what
she
d
have
done
without
me
she
hadn
t
a
friend
at
any
rate
she
hadn
t
a
friend
with
a
grain
of
sense
astonishing
how
solitary
some
couples
are
it
aged
her
frightfully
she
s
much
younger
than
she
looks
happily
there
was
a
bit
of
money
enough
in
fact
deeply
as
edwin
had
been
impressed
by
his
romantic
discovery
of
a
woman
in
ingpen
s
room
at
hanbridge
he
was
still
more
impressed
by
it
now
he
saw
the
whole
scene
again
and
saw
it
far
more
poetically
he
accused
himself
of
blindness
and
also
of
a
certain
harshness
of
attitude
towards
the
woman
he
endowed
her
now
with
wondrous
qualities
the
adventure
in
its
tragicalness
and
its
clandestine
tenderness
was
enchanting
how
exquisite
must
be
the
relations
between
ingpen
and
the
woman
if
without
warning
she
could
go
to
his
lair
at
night
and
wait
confidently
for
his
return
how
divine
the
surprise
for
him
how
ardent
the
welcome
he
envied
ingpen
and
also
he
admired
him
for
ingpen
had
obviously
conducted
the
affair
with
worthy
expertise
and
he
had
known
how
to
win
devotion
with
an
air
of
impartiality
ingpen
proceeded
you
wouldn
t
see
her
quite
at
her
best
i
m
afraid
she
s
very
shy
and
naturally
she
d
be
more
shy
than
ever
when
you
saw
her
she
s
quite
a
different
woman
when
the
shyness
has
worn
off
the
first
two
or
three
times
i
met
her
i
must
say
i
didn
t
think
she
was
anything
more
than
a
nice
creature
you
know
what
i
mean
but
she
s
much
more
than
that
can
t
play
but
i
believe
she
has
a
real
feeling
for
music
she
has
time
for
reading
and
she
does
read
and
she
has
a
more
masculine
understanding
than
nearly
any
other
woman
i
ve
ever
come
across
you
wait
a
bit
thought
edwin
this
simplicity
on
the
part
of
a
notable
man
of
the
world
pleased
him
and
gave
him
a
comfortable
sense
of
superiority
aloud
he
responded
sympathetically
good
do
i
understand
she
s
living
in
the
five
towns
now
yes
said
ingpen
after
a
hesitation
he
spoke
in
a
peculiar
significant
voice
carefully
modest
the
single
monosyllable
conveyed
to
edwin
i
can
not
deny
it
i
was
necessary
to
this
woman
and
in
the
end
she
followed
me
edwin
was
impressed
anew
by
the
full
revelation
of
romance
which
had
concealed
itself
in
the
squalid
dailiness
of
the
five
towns
in
fact
said
ingpen
you
never
know
your
luck
if
she
d
been
free
i
might
have
been
fool
enough
to
get
married
why
do
you
say
a
thing
like
that
because
i
think
i
should
be
a
fool
to
marry
ingpen
tapping
his
front
teeth
with
his
spoke
reflectively
persuasively
and
with
calm
detachment
why
asked
edwin
persuasively
also
but
nervously
as
though
the
spirit
of
adventure
in
the
search
for
truth
was
pushing
him
to
fatal
dangers
marriage
isn
t
worth
the
price
for
me
that
is
i
daresay
i
m
peculiar
ingpen
said
this
quite
seriously
prepared
to
consider
impartially
the
proposition
that
he
was
peculiar
the
fact
is
my
boy
i
think
my
freedom
is
worth
a
bit
more
than
i
could
get
out
of
any
marriage
that
s
all
very
well
said
edwin
trying
to
speak
with
the
same
dispassionate
conviction
as
ingpen
and
scarcely
succeeding
but
look
what
you
miss
look
how
you
live
almost
involuntarily
he
glanced
with
round
the
unlovely
unseemly
room
and
his
glance
seemed
to
penetrate
ceilings
and
walls
and
to
discover
and
condemn
the
whole
charmless
house
from
top
to
bottom
why
what
s
the
matter
with
it
ingpen
replied
uneasily
a
slight
flush
came
into
his
cheeks
nobody
has
a
more
comfortable
bed
or
more
comfortable
boots
than
i
have
how
many
women
can
make
coffee
as
good
as
mine
no
woman
ever
born
can
make
tea
i
have
all
i
want
no
you
don
t
and
what
s
the
good
of
talking
about
coffee
and
tea
and
beds
well
what
else
is
there
i
want
that
i
haven
t
got
if
you
mean
fancy
cushions
and
draperies
no
thanks
you
know
what
i
mean
all
right
and
then
freedom
as
you
say
what
do
you
mean
by
freedom
i
don
t
specially
mean
said
ingpen
tranquil
and
benevolent
what
i
may
call
physical
freedom
i
d
give
that
up
i
like
a
certain
amount
of
untidiness
for
instance
and
i
don
t
think
an
absence
of
dust
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
but
i
wouldn
t
in
the
least
mind
giving
all
that
up
it
wouldn
t
really
matter
to
me
what
i
won
t
give
up
is
my
intellectual
freedom
perhaps
i
mean
intellectual
honesty
i
d
give
up
even
my
intellectual
freedom
if
i
could
be
deprived
of
it
fairly
and
honestly
but
i
shouldn
t
be
there
s
almost
no
intellectual
honesty
in
marriage
there
can
t
be
the
entire
affair
is
a
series
of
compromises
chiefly
base
on
the
part
of
the
man
the
alternative
is
absolute
subjection
of
the
woman
which
is
offensive
no
woman
not
absolutely
a
slave
ever
hears
the
truth
except
in
anger
you
can
t
say
the
same
about
men
and
you
know
it
i
m
not
blaming
i
m
stating
even
assuming
a
married
man
gets
a
few
advantages
that
i
miss
they
re
all
purely
physical
oh
no
not
at
all
my
boy
ingpen
insisted
sitting
up
and
gazing
earnestly
at
edwin
analyse
them
down
and
they
re
all
physical
all
and
i
tell
you
i
won
t
pay
the
price
for
them
i
won
t
i
ve
no
grievance
against
women
i
can
enjoy
being
with
women
as
much
as
anybody
but
i
won
t
i
will
not
live
permanently
on
their
level
that
s
why
i
say
i
might
have
been
fool
enough
to
get
married
it
s
quite
simple
hm
edwin
although
indubitably
one
of
those
who
had
committed
the
vast
folly
of
marriage
and
therefore
subject
to
ingpen
s
indictment
felt
not
the
least
constraint
nor
any
need
to
offer
an
individual
defence
ingpen
s
demeanour
seemed
to
have
lifted
the
argument
above
the
personal
his
assumption
that
edwin
could
not
be
offended
was
positively
inspiring
to
edwin
the
fear
of
truth
was
exorcised
freedom
of
thought
existed
in
that
room
in
england
edwin
reflected
if
he
s
right
and
i
m
condemned
accordingly
well
i
can
t
help
it
facts
are
facts
and
they
re
extremely
interesting
he
also
reflected
why
on
earth
can
t
hilda
and
i
discuss
like
that
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
profoundly
and
sadly
knew
that
such
discussion
would
be
quite
impossible
with
hilda
the
coals
in
the
grate
subsided
together
and
i
ll
tell
you
another
thing
ingpen
commenced
he
was
stopped
by
the
entrance
of
dummer
a
fat
woman
with
an
old
japanned
tray
dummer
came
in
like
a
desperate
forlorn
hope
her
aged
grim
and
yet
somewhat
hysterical
face
seemed
to
say
i
m
going
to
clear
this
table
and
get
on
with
my
work
even
if
i
die
for
it
at
the
hands
of
a
brutal
tyrant
her
gestures
as
she
made
a
space
for
the
tray
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
were
the
formidable
gestures
of
the
persecuted
at
bay
dummer
said
ingpen
in
a
weak
voice
leaning
back
in
his
chair
would
you
mind
fetching
me
my
tonic
off
my
i
ve
forgotten
it
bless
us
exclaimed
dummer
as
she
had
hurried
out
ingpen
winked
placidly
at
edwin
in
the
room
in
which
the
shadows
were
already
falling
nevertheless
when
the
arrived
at
the
ingpen
did
seem
to
show
some
signs
of
exhaustion
hilda
would
not
get
down
she
sent
word
into
the
house
by
george
that
the
departure
must
occur
at
once
ingpen
went
out
with
edwin
plaintively
teased
hilda
about
the
insufferable
pride
of
those
who
sit
in
and
took
leave
of
her
with
the
most
punctilious
and
chivalrous
ceremonial
while
hilda
inscrutably
smiling
bent
down
to
him
with
condescension
from
her
perch
i
ll
sit
behind
going
home
i
think
said
edwin
george
you
can
sit
with
your
mother
tchik
tchik
hilda
signalled
the
mare
with
a
jerk
started
off
down
the
misty
and
darkening
road
iv
the
second
and
major
catastrophe
occurred
very
soon
after
the
arrival
in
trafalgar
road
it
was
of
an
hour
after
sunset
and
the
street
lamps
were
lighted
unchpin
with
gloomy
fatalism
shivered
obscurely
in
the
dark
porch
waiting
to
drive
the
down
to
the
stable
hilda
had
requested
his
presence
it
was
she
also
who
had
got
him
to
bring
the
equipage
up
to
the
house
in
the
morning
she
had
implied
but
not
asserted
that
to
harness
the
mare
and
trot
up
to
bleakridge
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
and
that
a
few
minutes
light
labour
could
make
no
real
difference
to
unchpin
s
christmas
day
edwin
descrying
unchpin
in
the
porch
saw
merely
a
defenceless
man
who
had
been
robbed
of
the
most
sacred
holiday
of
the
year
in
order
to
gratify
the
selfish
caprice
of
an
overbearing
woman
when
asked
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
porch
unchpin
firmly
answered
that
he
had
been
there
since
three
o
clock
the
hour
appointed
by
clayhanger
edwin
knew
nothing
of
this
appointment
and
in
it
he
saw
more
evidence
of
hilda
s
thoughtless
egotism
he
perceived
that
he
would
be
compelled
to
stop
her
from
using
his
employees
as
her
private
servants
and
that
the
prohibition
would
probably
cause
trouble
hilda
demanded
curtly
of
unchpin
why
he
had
not
waited
in
the
warm
kitchen
according
to
instructions
instead
of
catching
his
death
of
cold
in
the
porch
the
reply
was
that
he
had
rung
and
knocked
fifteen
times
without
getting
a
response
at
this
hilda
became
angry
not
only
with
emmie
the
defaulting
servant
but
with
the
entire
servant
class
and
with
the
world
emmie
the
new
cook
and
temporarily
the
sole
resident
servant
was
to
have
gone
to
maggie
s
for
her
christmas
dinner
and
to
have
returned
at
half
past
two
without
fail
in
order
to
light
the
fire
and
prepare
for
but
maggie
at
the
last
moment
having
decided
to
go
to
clara
s
for
the
middle
of
the
day
emmie
was
told
to
go
with
her
and
be
as
useful
as
she
could
at
benbow
s
until
a
quarter
past
two
i
hope
you
ve
got
your
edwin
said
hilda
threateningly
as
if
ready
to
assume
that
with
characteristic
and
inexcusable
negligence
he
had
left
his
at
home
i
have
he
said
drily
drawing
the
key
from
his
pocket
oh
she
muttered
as
if
saying
well
after
all
you
re
no
better
than
you
ought
to
be
and
took
the
key
while
she
opened
the
door
edwin
surreptitiously
gave
half
a
crown
to
unchpin
who
was
lighting
the
george
with
the
marvellous
instinct
of
a
small
animal
unprotected
against
irritated
prowling
monsters
had
become
invisible
the
yawned
black
like
the
portal
of
a
tomb
the
place
was
a
terrible
negation
of
christmas
edwin
felt
for
the
radiator
it
was
as
cold
to
the
touch
as
a
dead
hand
he
lit
the
and
the
decorations
of
holly
and
mistletoe
contrived
by
hilda
and
george
with
smiles
and
laughter
on
christmas
eve
stood
revealed
as
the
very
symbol
of
insincerity
without
taking
off
his
hat
and
coat
he
went
into
the
unlighted
glacial
where
hilda
was
kneeling
at
the
grate
and
striking
matches
a
fragment
of
newspaper
blazed
and
then
the
flame
expired
the
fire
was
badly
laid
i
m
sick
of
servants
hilda
exclaimed
with
fury
sick
they
re
all
alike
her
tone
furiously
blamed
edwin
and
everybody
and
edwin
knew
that
the
day
was
a
pyramid
of
which
this
moment
was
the
dreadful
apex
at
intervals
during
the
drive
home
hilda
had
talked
confidentially
to
george
of
the
wondrous
things
he
and
she
could
do
if
they
only
resided
in
the
country
things
connected
with
flowers
vegetables
cocks
hens
ducks
cows
rabbits
horses
she
had
sketched
out
the
life
of
a
mistress
of
ladderedge
hall
and
she
had
sketched
it
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
dull
hard
man
sitting
behind
her
voice
so
persuasive
and
caressing
to
george
had
been
charged
with
all
sorts
of
accusations
against
the
silent
fellow
whose
back
now
and
then
collided
with
hers
she
had
exasperated
him
she
had
wilfully
and
deliberately
exasperated
him
her
treatment
of
unchpin
her
childish
outburst
concerning
servants
her
acutely
disagreeable
demeanour
all
combined
now
to
exhaust
the
poor
remainder
of
edwin
s
patience
not
one
word
had
been
said
about
ladderedge
hall
but
ladderedge
hall
loomed
always
between
them
deadly
war
was
imminent
let
it
come
he
would
prefer
war
to
a
peace
which
meant
for
him
nothing
but
insults
and
injustice
he
would
welcome
war
he
turned
brusquely
and
lit
the
chandelier
on
the
table
beneath
it
lay
the
that
hilda
had
given
to
george
and
the
edition
of
matthew
arnold
that
she
had
given
to
edwin
for
a
christmas
present
one
of
edwin
s
christmas
presents
to
her
an
ermine
stole
she
was
wearing
round
her
neck
tragic
absurdities
these
false
tokens
of
love
there
they
were
both
of
them
in
full
street
attire
she
kneeling
at
the
grate
and
he
standing
at
the
table
in
the
dank
which
now
had
no
resemblance
to
a
home
edwin
said
with
frigid
and
disdainful
malevolence
i
wish
you
could
control
yourself
hilda
the
fact
that
a
servant
s
a
bit
late
on
christmas
day
is
no
reason
for
you
to
behave
like
a
spoilt
child
you
re
offensive
his
words
righteously
and
almost
murderously
resentful
seemed
to
startle
and
frighten
the
very
furniture
which
had
the
air
of
waiting
enchanted
for
disaster
hilda
turned
her
head
and
glared
at
edwin
she
threw
back
her
shoulders
and
her
thick
eyebrows
seemed
to
meet
in
a
passionate
frown
yes
she
said
with
her
clear
stinging
articulation
that
s
just
like
you
that
is
i
lend
my
servant
to
your
sister
she
doesn
t
send
her
back
and
it
s
my
fault
i
should
have
thought
the
benbows
twisted
you
round
their
little
finger
enough
without
you
having
to
insult
me
because
of
them
goodness
knows
what
tricks
they
didn
t
play
to
get
your
aunt
s
money
every
penny
of
it
and
now
they
make
you
do
all
the
work
of
the
estate
for
their
benefit
and
of
course
you
do
it
like
a
lamb
you
can
never
spare
a
minute
from
the
works
for
me
but
you
can
spare
hours
and
hours
for
auntie
hamps
s
estate
and
the
benbows
it
s
always
like
that
she
paused
and
spoke
more
thickly
but
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
insult
me
on
the
top
of
it
her
features
went
awry
she
sobbed
you
make
me
ill
said
edwin
savagely
he
walked
out
of
the
room
and
pulled
the
door
to
george
was
descending
the
stairs
where
are
you
going
to
uncle
demanded
george
as
edwin
opened
the
i
m
going
down
to
see
auntie
maggie
edwin
answered
forcing
himself
to
speak
very
gently
tell
your
mother
if
she
asks
the
boy
guessed
the
situation
it
was
humiliating
that
he
should
guess
it
and
still
more
humiliating
to
be
compelled
to
make
use
of
him
in
the
fatal
affair
v
he
walked
at
a
moderate
pace
down
trafalgar
road
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
certainly
he
was
not
going
to
see
maggie
he
had
invented
the
visit
to
maggie
instantly
in
answer
to
george
s
question
and
he
could
not
understand
why
he
had
invented
it
maggie
would
be
at
clara
s
and
in
a
misfortune
he
would
never
go
to
clara
s
only
when
he
was
successful
and
triumphant
could
he
expose
himself
to
the
benbows
the
weather
was
damp
and
chill
without
rain
the
chilliness
was
rather
tonic
and
agreeable
to
his
body
and
he
felt
quite
warm
though
on
getting
down
from
the
a
few
minutes
earlier
he
had
been
cold
almost
to
the
point
of
numbness
he
could
not
remember
how
nor
when
the
change
had
occurred
every
street
lamp
was
the
centre
of
a
sphere
which
presaged
rain
as
though
the
were
the
moon
the
pavements
were
greasy
with
black
slime
the
road
deep
in
mire
through
which
the
ran
straight
and
gleaming
far
down
the
slope
a
cage
of
light
moving
obscurely
between
the
glittering
avenue
of
lamps
indicated
the
as
it
lifted
towards
the
further
hill
into
the
heart
of
the
town
where
the
lamps
merged
together
and
vanished
but
a
little
to
the
left
the
illuminated
dial
of
the
clock
in
the
town
hall
tower
glowed
in
the
dark
heavens
the
street
was
deserted
no
boys
no
ragged
girls
staring
into
sweet
shops
no
artisans
returning
from
work
no
rattling
carts
no
vehicles
of
any
kind
save
the
distant
tram
all
the
little
shops
were
shut
even
the
little
greengrocer
s
shop
which
never
closed
was
shut
now
and
its
customary
winter
smell
of
oranges
and
apples
withdrawn
the
little
inns
not
yet
open
showed
through
their
lettered
plate
windows
one
watching
jet
of
gas
amid
paper
festoons
and
bunches
of
holly
the
gloomy
fronts
of
nearly
all
the
houses
were
pierced
with
oblongs
of
light
on
which
sometimes
appeared
transient
shadows
of
human
beings
a
very
few
other
human
beings
equally
mysterious
passed
furtive
and
baffling
up
and
down
the
slope
melancholy
familiar
inexplicable
and
piteous
the
melancholy
of
existence
itself
rose
like
a
vapour
out
of
the
sodden
ground
ennobling
all
the
scene
the
lofty
disc
of
the
town
hall
clock
solitary
in
the
sky
was
somehow
so
and
the
lives
of
the
people
both
within
and
without
the
houses
seemed
to
be
so
woven
of
futility
and
sorrow
that
the
menace
of
eternity
grew
intolerable
edwin
s
brain
throbbed
and
shook
like
an
in
which
the
machinery
was
his
violent
thoughts
he
no
longer
saw
his
marriage
as
a
chain
of
disconnected
episodes
he
saw
it
as
a
drama
the
true
meaning
of
which
was
at
last
revealed
by
the
climax
now
upon
him
he
had
had
many
misgivings
about
it
and
had
put
them
away
and
they
all
swept
back
presenting
themselves
as
a
series
of
signs
that
pointed
to
inevitable
disaster
he
had
been
blind
from
wilfulness
or
cowardice
he
now
had
vision
he
had
arrived
at
honesty
he
said
to
himself
as
millions
of
men
and
women
have
said
to
themselves
with
awestruck
calm
my
marriage
was
a
mistake
and
he
began
to
face
the
consequences
of
the
admission
he
was
not
such
a
fool
as
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
the
immediate
quarrel
nor
even
to
the
but
supreme
dissension
concerning
a
place
of
residence
he
assumed
even
that
the
present
difficulties
would
somehow
with
more
or
less
satisfaction
be
adjusted
what
however
would
not
and
could
not
be
adjusted
was
the
temperament
that
produced
them
those
difficulties
which
had
been
preceded
by
smaller
difficulties
would
be
followed
by
greater
it
was
inevitable
to
hope
otherwise
would
be
weakly
sentimental
as
his
optimism
during
the
vigil
in
auntie
hamps
s
bedroom
had
been
weakly
sentimental
he
must
face
the
truth
she
won
t
alter
her
ways
and
i
shan
t
stand
them
no
matter
what
their
relations
might
in
future
superficially
appear
to
be
their
union
was
over
or
if
it
was
not
actually
over
it
soon
would
be
over
for
the
forces
to
shatter
it
were
uncontrollable
and
increasing
in
strength
of
course
she
can
t
help
being
herself
he
said
impartially
but
what
s
that
got
to
do
with
me
his
indictment
of
his
wife
was
terrific
and
not
to
be
answered
she
had
always
been
a
queer
girl
on
the
first
night
he
ever
saw
her
she
had
run
after
him
into
his
father
s
garden
and
stood
with
him
in
the
that
he
had
since
done
away
with
and
spoken
to
him
in
the
strangest
manner
she
was
abnormal
the
dismal
and
perilous
adventure
with
george
cannon
could
not
have
happened
to
a
normal
woman
she
could
not
see
reason
and
her
sense
of
justice
was
if
she
wanted
a
thing
she
must
have
it
in
reality
she
was
a
fierce
and
unscrupulous
egotist
incapable
of
understanding
a
point
of
view
other
than
her
own
imagine
her
bursting
out
like
that
about
auntie
hamps
s
will
it
showed
how
her
mind
ran
that
auntie
hamps
had
an
absolute
right
to
dispose
of
her
goods
as
she
pleased
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
auntie
hamps
s
arrangements
that
in
any
case
the
benbows
were
not
to
blame
that
jealousy
was
despicable
and
the
mark
of
a
mean
mind
that
the
only
dignified
course
for
himself
was
to
execute
the
trust
imposed
upon
him
without
complaining
these
things
were
obvious
but
not
to
her
no
human
skill
could
ever
induce
her
to
grant
them
she
did
not
argue
she
felt
and
the
disaster
was
that
she
did
not
feel
rightly
imagine
her
trying
to
influence
ingpen
s
housekeeping
to
worry
the
man
she
the
guest
and
he
the
host
what
would
she
say
if
anybody
played
the
same
game
on
her
she
could
not
be
moderate
she
expected
every
consideration
from
others
but
she
would
yield
none
she
had
desired
a
horse
and
trap
she
had
received
it
and
how
had
she
used
the
gift
she
had
used
it
in
defiance
of
the
needs
of
the
works
she
had
upset
everybody
and
everything
and
assuredly
unchpin
had
a
very
legitimate
grievance
she
had
said
that
she
could
not
feel
at
home
in
her
own
house
while
the
house
belonged
to
maggie
edwin
had
obediently
bought
the
house
and
now
she
wanted
another
house
she
scorned
her
husband
s
convenience
and
preferences
and
she
wanted
a
house
that
was
preposterously
inaccessible
the
satisfaction
of
her
caprice
for
a
had
not
in
the
slightest
degree
appeased
her
egotism
on
the
contrary
it
had
further
excited
her
egotism
and
sharpened
its
aggressiveness
and
by
what
strange
infantile
paths
had
she
gone
about
the
enterprise
of
shifting
edwin
into
the
country
not
a
frank
word
to
edwin
of
the
house
she
had
found
and
decided
upon
silly
rumours
of
a
surprise
and
she
had
counted
upon
the
presence
of
ingpen
to
disarm
edwin
and
to
tie
his
hands
the
conspiracy
was
simply
childish
and
because
edwin
had
at
once
shown
his
distaste
for
her
scheme
she
had
taken
offence
her
acrimony
had
gradually
increased
throughout
the
day
hiding
for
a
time
under
malicious
silences
and
enigmatic
demeanours
darting
out
in
remarks
to
third
persons
and
drawing
back
and
at
last
displaying
itself
openly
cruelly
monstrously
the
injustice
of
it
all
passed
belief
there
was
no
excuse
for
hilda
and
there
never
would
be
any
excuse
for
her
she
was
impossible
she
would
be
still
more
impossible
he
did
not
make
her
responsible
he
admitted
that
she
was
not
responsible
but
at
the
same
time
with
a
disdainful
and
cold
resentment
he
condemned
and
hated
her
he
recalled
ingpen
s
i
won
t
pay
the
price
and
i
won
t
he
said
the
end
has
come
he
envied
ingpen
and
there
flitted
through
his
mind
the
dream
of
liberty
not
the
liberty
of
ignorant
youth
but
liberty
with
experience
and
knowledge
to
use
it
ravishing
prospect
marriage
had
advantages
but
he
could
retain
those
advantages
in
freedom
he
knew
what
a
home
ought
to
be
he
had
the
instinct
of
the
interior
he
considered
that
he
could
keep
house
as
well
as
any
woman
and
better
than
most
he
was
not
in
that
respect
at
all
like
ingpen
who
suffered
from
his
inability
to
produce
and
maintain
comfort
he
remembered
ingpen
s
historic
habitual
phrase
about
the
proper
place
for
women
behind
the
veil
it
was
a
phrase
which
intensely
annoyed
women
but
nevertheless
how
true
and
ingpen
had
put
it
into
practice
ingpen
even
in
the
banal
five
towns
had
shown
the
way
he
saw
the
existence
of
males
with
its
rationality
and
its
dependableness
its
simplicity
its
directness
its
honesty
as
something
ideal
and
as
he
pictured
such
an
existence
with
or
without
the
romance
of
mysterious
and
interesting
creatures
ever
modestly
waiting
for
attention
behind
the
veil
further
souvenirs
of
hilda
s
wilful
naughtiness
and
injustice
rushed
into
his
mind
by
thousands
in
formulating
to
himself
his
indictment
against
her
he
had
overlooked
ninety
per
cent
of
them
they
were
endless
innumerable
he
marshalled
them
again
and
again
with
the
fiercest
virulence
the
most
sombre
gloom
with
sardonic
bitter
pleasure
in
the
hollow
where
trafalgar
road
begins
to
be
known
as
duck
bank
he
turned
to
the
left
and
crossing
the
foot
of
woodisun
bank
arrived
at
one
of
the
oldest
quarters
of
the
town
where
luke
s
church
stands
in
its
churchyard
amid
a
triangle
of
little
ancient
houses
by
the
light
of
a
new
and
improved
at
the
churchyard
gates
could
be
seen
the
dark
silhouette
of
the
norman
tower
and
the
occasional
white
gleam
of
gravestones
one
solitary
couple
and
bending
slightly
towards
each
other
came
sauntering
in
the
mud
past
the
historic
national
schools
towards
the
illumination
of
the
lamp
the
man
was
a
volunteer
with
a
brilliant
vermilion
tunic
white
belt
and
black
trousers
he
wore
his
hat
jauntily
and
carried
a
diminutive
cane
pride
was
his
warm
overcoat
the
girl
was
stout
and
short
with
a
heavily
flowered
hat
and
a
dark
amorphous
cloak
under
her
left
arm
she
carried
a
parcel
they
were
absorbed
in
themselves
edwin
discerned
first
the
man
s
face
in
which
was
a
gentle
and
harmless
coxcombry
and
then
the
girl
s
face
ecstatic
seeing
absolutely
naught
but
the
youth
it
was
emmie
s
face
as
edwin
perceived
after
a
momentary
doubt
due
to
his
unfamiliarity
with
the
inhabitants
of
his
own
house
emmie
so
impatiently
and
angrily
awaited
by
her
mistress
had
lost
her
head
about
a
uniform
emmie
whose
place
was
in
the
kitchen
among
saucepans
and
crockery
and
brushes
had
escaped
into
another
realm
where
time
is
not
that
she
had
no
immediate
intention
of
returning
to
her
kitchen
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
she
was
moving
deliberately
in
a
direction
away
from
it
she
was
not
pretty
for
hilda
had
perforce
long
since
ceased
to
insist
upon
physical
charm
in
her
servants
she
was
not
even
young
she
was
probably
older
than
the
adored
soldier
but
her
rapt
ecstasy
her
fearful
bliss
made
a
marvellous
sight
rendered
touching
by
the
girl
s
coarse
gawkiness
it
seemed
lamentable
pathetic
to
edwin
that
destiny
should
not
permit
her
to
remain
forever
in
that
dream
can
it
be
possible
he
thought
that
a
creature
capable
of
such
surpassing
emotion
is
compelled
to
cook
my
bacon
and
black
my
boots
the
couple
wordless
strolled
onwards
sticking
close
to
the
railings
the
churchyard
was
locked
but
emmie
and
the
soldier
were
doing
the
best
they
could
to
satisfy
that
instinct
which
in
the
five
towns
seems
to
drive
lovers
to
graves
for
their
pleasure
the
little
houses
cast
here
and
there
a
blind
yellow
eye
on
the
silent
and
tranquil
scene
edwin
turned
abruptly
back
into
woodisun
bank
feeling
that
he
was
a
disturber
of
the
peace
suddenly
deciding
to
walk
up
to
hillport
for
the
sake
of
exercise
he
quickened
his
pace
after
a
mile
and
a
half
when
he
had
crossed
the
railway
at
shawport
and
was
on
the
hillport
rise
and
the
five
towns
had
begun
to
spread
out
in
a
map
behind
him
he
noticed
that
he
was
perspiring
he
very
seldom
perspired
and
therefore
he
had
the
conviction
that
the
walk
was
doing
him
good
he
felt
exhilarated
and
moved
still
faster
his
mood
was
now
changed
the
spectacle
of
emmie
and
the
soldier
had
thrown
him
violently
out
of
resentment
into
wonder
his
indignation
was
somewhat
exhausted
and
though
he
tried
again
and
again
to
flick
it
back
into
full
heat
and
activity
he
could
not
he
kept
thinking
of
the
moment
in
the
morning
when
standing
ready
to
jump
from
the
his
wife
had
said
catch
me
both
of
you
and
he
recalled
vividly
the
sensation
of
her
acquiescence
her
momentary
yielding
imperceptible
yet
unforgettable
as
he
supported
her
strongly
in
his
arms
and
with
this
memory
was
mingled
the
smell
of
velvet
strange
that
a
woman
so
harsh
selfish
and
overbearing
could
thus
contradict
her
whole
character
in
an
instant
of
surrender
was
she
in
that
gesture
confiding
to
him
the
deepest
secret
rubbish
but
now
he
no
longer
looked
down
on
her
disdainfully
honesty
made
him
admit
that
it
was
puerile
to
affect
disdain
of
an
individuality
so
powerful
and
so
mysterious
if
she
was
a
foe
she
was
at
any
rate
a
dangerous
fighter
and
not
to
be
played
with
and
yet
she
could
be
a
trifle
a
wisp
of
fragile
flesh
in
his
arms
he
saw
the
beatific
face
of
emmie
against
the
churchyard
gates
under
the
lamp
why
not
humour
hilda
why
not
let
her
plant
their
home
according
to
her
caprice
certainly
not
never
would
he
do
it
why
should
he
time
after
time
he
angrily
rejected
the
idea
time
after
time
it
returned
what
did
it
matter
to
hilda
where
she
lived
and
had
he
not
bought
their
present
house
solely
in
order
to
please
her
the
first
consideration
in
choosing
a
home
ought
to
be
and
must
be
the
consideration
of
business
convenience
yet
what
did
it
matter
to
him
where
his
home
was
he
remembered
a
phrase
of
ingpen
s
i
don
t
live
on
that
plane
could
he
not
adapt
himself
he
dreamt
of
very
rapid
transit
between
ladderedge
hall
and
the
works
had
just
become
lawful
but
he
had
never
happened
to
see
one
though
he
had
heard
of
several
in
the
district
or
passing
through
his
imagination
could
not
rise
so
high
as
a
that
he
could
ever
use
or
possess
one
did
not
even
occur
to
him
he
thought
only
of
a
horse
and
a
trap
with
indiarubber
tyres
himself
the
driver
sometimes
hilda
the
driver
an
equipage
to
earn
renown
in
the
district
clayhanger
s
trap
he
drives
in
from
ladderedge
in
minutes
the
horse
simply
won
t
walk
doesn
t
know
how
to
and
so
on
he
had
heard
such
talk
of
others
why
should
not
others
hear
it
of
him
then
the
pleasure
the
mere
pleasure
call
it
sensual
or
what
you
like
of
granting
a
caprice
to
the
capricious
creature
if
a
thing
afforded
her
joy
why
not
give
it
to
see
her
in
the
rôle
of
mistress
of
a
delicately
horsey
excited
about
charitable
schemes
protecting
the
poor
working
her
will
upon
gardeners
and
grooms
stamping
her
foot
in
the
violence
of
her
resolution
to
have
her
own
way
offering
sugar
to
a
horse
nursing
a
sick
dog
amusing
agreeable
and
all
that
activity
of
hers
a
mere
dependence
of
his
own
flattering
to
his
pride
he
could
afford
it
easily
for
he
was
richer
even
than
his
wife
supposed
to
let
the
present
house
ought
not
to
be
difficult
to
sell
it
advantageously
ought
not
to
be
impossible
in
this
connection
he
thought
though
not
seriously
of
tom
swetman
who
had
at
last
got
himself
engaged
to
one
of
those
scandinavian
women
about
whom
he
had
been
chaffed
for
years
tom
would
be
wanting
an
abode
and
probably
a
good
one
he
was
carried
away
by
his
own
dream
to
realise
that
dream
he
had
only
to
yield
to
nod
negligently
to
murmur
with
benevolent
tolerance
all
right
do
as
you
please
he
would
have
nothing
to
withdraw
for
he
had
uttered
no
refusal
not
a
word
had
passed
between
them
as
to
ladderedge
hall
since
they
had
quitted
it
he
had
merely
said
that
he
did
not
like
it
poured
cold
water
on
it
as
the
phrase
was
true
his
demeanour
had
plainly
intimated
that
he
was
still
opposed
in
principle
to
the
entire
project
of
living
in
the
country
but
a
demeanour
need
not
be
formally
retracted
it
could
be
negatived
without
any
humiliation
no
he
would
never
yield
though
yielding
seemed
to
open
up
a
pleasant
a
delicious
prospect
he
could
not
yield
it
would
be
wrong
and
it
would
be
dangerous
to
yield
had
he
not
already
quite
clearly
argued
out
with
himself
the
whole
position
and
yet
why
not
yield
he
was
afraid
as
before
a
temptation
he
the
railway
and
crossed
fowlea
brook
a
boundary
back
into
the
borough
the
dark
path
lay
parallel
with
the
canal
but
below
it
he
had
gone
right
through
hillport
and
round
hillport
marsh
and
returned
down
the
flank
of
the
great
ridge
that
protects
the
five
towns
on
the
west
he
could
not
recollect
the
details
of
the
walk
he
only
knew
that
he
had
done
it
all
that
time
and
the
miles
had
passed
with
miraculous
rapidity
and
that
his
boots
were
very
muddy
a
change
in
the
consistency
of
the
mud
caused
him
to
look
up
at
the
sky
which
was
clearing
and
showed
patches
of
faint
stars
a
frost
had
set
in
despite
the
rainy
prophecy
of
in
a
few
moments
he
had
climbed
the
short
steep
curving
slope
on
to
the
he
was
breathless
and
very
hot
he
stopped
and
sat
on
the
parapet
in
his
he
had
crossed
this
bridge
twice
a
day
on
the
journey
to
and
from
oldcastle
many
times
he
had
lingered
on
it
but
he
had
forgotten
the
little
episodes
of
his
schooldays
which
seemed
now
almost
to
belong
to
another
incarnation
he
did
however
recall
that
as
a
boy
he
could
not
sit
on
the
parapet
unless
he
vaulted
up
to
it
he
thought
he
must
have
been
ridiculously
small
and
boyish
the
lights
of
bursley
bleakridge
hanbridge
and
cauldon
hung
round
the
eastern
horizon
in
an
arc
to
the
north
presided
the
clock
of
bursley
town
hall
and
to
the
south
the
clock
of
cauldon
church
but
both
were
much
too
far
off
to
be
deciphered
below
and
around
the
church
clock
the
vague
fires
of
cauldon
bar
ironworks
played
and
the
tremendous
respiration
of
the
filled
the
evening
beneath
him
gleamed
the
foul
water
of
the
canal
he
trembled
with
the
fever
that
precedes
a
supreme
decision
he
trembled
as
though
he
was
about
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
canal
should
he
accept
the
scheme
ought
he
to
accept
it
the
question
was
not
simply
that
of
a
place
of
residence
it
concerned
all
his
life
he
admitted
that
marriage
must
be
a
mutual
accommodation
he
was
and
always
had
been
ready
to
accommodate
but
hilda
was
unjust
monstrously
unjust
of
that
he
was
definitely
convinced
well
perhaps
not
monstrously
unjust
but
very
unjust
how
could
he
excuse
such
injustice
as
hers
he
obviously
could
not
excuse
it
on
previous
occasions
he
had
invented
excuses
for
her
conduct
but
they
were
not
convincing
excuses
they
were
compromises
between
his
intellectual
honesty
and
his
desire
for
peace
they
were
at
bottom
sentimentalism
and
then
there
flashed
into
his
mind
complete
the
great
discovery
of
all
his
career
it
was
banal
it
was
commonplace
it
was
what
everyone
knew
yet
it
was
the
great
discovery
of
all
his
career
if
hilda
had
not
been
unjust
in
the
assertion
of
her
own
individuality
there
could
be
no
merit
in
yielding
to
her
to
yield
to
a
just
claim
was
not
meritorious
though
to
withstand
it
would
be
wicked
he
was
objecting
to
injustice
as
a
child
objects
to
rain
on
a
holiday
injustice
was
a
tremendous
actuality
it
had
to
be
faced
and
accepted
he
himself
was
unjust
at
any
rate
he
intellectually
conceived
that
he
must
be
unjust
though
honestly
he
could
remember
no
instance
of
injustice
on
his
part
to
reconcile
oneself
to
injustice
was
the
master
achievement
he
had
read
it
he
had
been
aware
of
it
but
he
had
never
really
felt
it
till
that
moment
on
the
dark
he
was
awed
thrilled
by
the
realisation
he
longed
ardently
to
put
it
to
the
test
he
did
put
it
to
the
test
he
yielded
on
the
and
in
yielding
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
victorious
he
thought
confidently
and
joyously
i
m
not
going
to
be
beaten
by
hilda
and
i
m
not
going
to
be
beaten
by
marriage
dashed
if
i
am
a
nice
thing
if
i
had
to
admit
that
i
wasn
t
clever
enough
to
be
a
husband
he
was
happy
but
somewhat
timorously
so
he
had
the
sense
to
suspect
that
his
discovery
would
scarcely
transform
marriage
into
an
everlasting
eden
and
that
serious
trouble
would
not
improbably
recur
marriage
keeps
on
all
the
time
till
you
re
dead
he
said
to
himself
but
he
profoundly
knew
that
he
had
advanced
a
stage
that
he
had
acquired
new
wisdom
and
new
power
and
that
no
danger
in
the
future
could
equal
the
danger
that
was
past
he
thought
i
know
where
i
am
it
had
taken
him
years
to
discover
where
he
was
why
should
the
discovery
occur
just
then
he
could
only
suppose
that
the
cumulative
battering
of
experience
had
at
length
knocked
a
hole
through
his
thick
head
and
let
saving
wisdom
in
the
length
of
time
necessary
for
the
operation
depended
upon
the
thickness
of
the
head
some
heads
were
impenetrable
and
their
owners
came
necessarily
to
disaster
his
head
was
probably
of
an
average
thickness
when
he
got
into
trafalgar
road
at
the
summit
of
bleakridge
he
hesitated
to
enter
his
own
house
on
account
of
the
acute
social
difficulties
that
awaited
him
there
and
passed
it
like
a
beggar
who
is
afraid
one
by
one
he
went
by
all
the
new
little
streets
of
cottages
with
millett
street
wilcox
street
paul
street
oak
street
hulton
street
and
the
two
old
little
streets
already
partly
changed
manor
street
and
higginbotham
street
those
mysterious
newcoming
families
from
nowhere
were
driving
him
out
through
the
agency
of
his
wife
the
orgreaves
had
gone
and
been
succeeded
by
excellent
people
with
whom
it
was
impossible
to
fraternise
there
were
rumours
that
in
view
of
tom
swetnam
s
imminent
defection
the
swetnam
household
might
be
broken
up
and
the
home
abandoned
the
suttons
now
that
beatrice
sutton
had
left
the
district
talked
seriously
of
going
only
sterling
was
left
on
that
side
of
the
road
and
he
stayed
because
he
must
the
once
exclusive
terraces
on
the
other
side
were
losing
their
quality
old
darius
clayhanger
had
risen
out
of
the
mass
but
he
was
fiercely
exceptional
now
the
whole
mass
seemed
to
be
rising
under
the
action
of
some
strange
leaven
and
those
few
who
by
intelligence
by
manners
or
by
money
counted
themselves
select
were
fleeing
as
from
an
inundation
edwin
had
not
meant
to
join
in
the
exodus
but
he
too
would
join
it
destiny
had
seized
him
let
him
be
as
democratic
in
spirit
as
he
would
his
fate
was
to
be
cut
off
from
the
democracy
with
which
for
the
rest
he
had
very
little
of
speech
or
thought
or
emotion
in
common
but
in
which
from
an
implacable
sense
of
justice
he
was
religiously
and
unchangeably
determined
to
put
his
trust
he
braced
himself
and
mounting
the
steps
of
the
porch
felt
in
his
pocket
for
his
latchkey
it
was
not
there
hilda
had
taken
it
and
not
returned
it
she
never
did
return
it
when
she
borrowed
it
and
probably
she
never
would
he
had
intended
to
slip
quietly
into
the
house
and
prepare
if
possible
an
astute
opening
to
minimise
the
difficulty
of
the
scenes
which
must
inevitably
occur
for
his
dignity
would
need
some
protection
in
the
matter
of
his
dignity
he
wished
that
he
had
not
said
quite
so
certainly
to
ingpen
i
shan
t
take
that
house
with
every
prim
formality
emmie
answered
his
ring
she
was
wearing
the
mask
and
the
black
frock
and
the
white
apron
and
cap
of
her
vocation
not
the
slightest
trace
of
the
beatified
woman
in
the
flowered
hat
under
the
lamp
at
the
gates
of
the
churchyard
no
sign
of
a
heart
or
of
passion
or
of
ecstasy
incredible
creatures
they
were
all
incredible
he
thought
nervous
i
shall
meet
hilda
in
half
a
second
george
ran
into
the
hall
wearing
his
new
green
shade
over
his
eyes
here
he
is
mother
cried
george
i
say
nunks
emmie
brought
up
a
parcel
for
you
from
uncle
albert
and
auntie
clara
here
it
is
it
wasn
t
addressed
outside
so
i
opened
it
he
indicated
the
on
which
in
a
bed
of
tissue
paper
and
brown
paper
lay
a
dreadful
flat
of
blue
glass
and
bronze
with
a
card
best
wishes
to
edwin
from
albert
and
clara
george
and
edwin
gazed
at
each
other
with
understanding
just
my
luck
isn
t
it
sonny
said
edwin
it
s
worse
than
last
year
s
you
poor
dear
said
hilda
appearing
all
smiles
and
caressing
glances
she
was
in
a
pale
grey
dress
whatever
shall
you
do
with
it
you
know
you
ll
have
to
put
it
on
view
when
they
come
up
emmie
to
the
maid
vanishing
into
the
kitchen
we
ll
have
supper
now
yes
said
edwin
to
himself
with
light
but
sardonic
tolerance
yes
my
lady
you
re
all
smiles
because
you
re
bent
on
getting
ladderedge
hall
out
of
me
but
you
don
t
know
what
a
near
shave
you
ve
had
of
getting
something
else
he
was
elated
the
welcome
of
his
familiar
home
was
beautiful
to
him
and
the
incalculable
woman
with
a
single
gesture
had
most
unexpectedly
annihilated
the
unpleasant
past
and
its
consequences
he
could
yield
upon
the
grand
contention
how
and
when
he
chose
he
had
his
acquiescence
waiting
like
a
delightful
surprise
for
hilda
as
he
looked
at
her
lovingly
with
all
her
crimes
of
injustice
thick
upon
her
he
clearly
realised
that
he
saw
her
as
no
other
person
saw
her
and
that
because
it
was
so
she
in
her
entirety
was
indispensable
to
him
and
when
he
tried
to
argue
impartially
and
aloofly
with
himself
about
rights
and
wrongs
asinine
reason
was
swamped
by
an
entirely
irrational
and
wise
joy
in
the
simple
fact
of
the
criminal
s
existence
vi
in
the
early
spring
of
there
was
an
evening
party
at
the
clayhangers
but
it
was
not
called
a
party
it
was
not
even
called
a
reception
the
theory
of
the
affair
was
that
hilda
had
just
asked
a
few
people
to
come
in
without
any
fuss
the
inhabitants
of
the
five
towns
had
and
still
have
an
aversion
for
every
sort
of
formal
hospitality
or
indeed
for
any
hospitality
other
than
the
impulsive
and
the
haphazard
one
or
two
fathers
with
forceful
daughters
agitated
by
newly
revealed
appetites
in
themselves
might
hire
a
in
january
and
give
a
dance
at
which
sharp
exercise
and
hot
drinks
alone
kept
bodies
warm
in
the
icy
atmosphere
also
musical
and
dramatic
societies
and
games
clubs
would
have
annual
conversaziones
and
dances
which
however
were
enterprises
of
coöperation
rather
than
of
hospitality
beyond
these
entertainments
there
was
almost
nothing
in
the
evening
save
and
the
small
regular
reunions
of
old
friends
who
had
foregathered
on
a
certain
night
of
the
week
for
whiskey
or
tea
and
gossip
ever
since
the
beginning
of
time
and
would
continue
to
do
so
till
some
coffin
or
other
was
ordered
every
prearranged
assemblage
comprising
more
than
two
persons
beyond
the
family
was
a
function
a
term
implying
both
contempt
and
respect
for
ceremonial
and
no
function
could
be
allowed
to
occur
without
an
excuse
for
it
such
as
an
anniversary
the
notion
of
deliberately
cultivating
human
intercourse
for
its
own
sake
would
have
been
regarded
as
an
affectation
approaching
snobbishness
hundreds
of
and
socially
unimpeachable
citizens
never
gave
or
received
an
invitation
to
a
meal
the
reason
of
all
this
was
not
meanness
for
no
community
outside
america
has
more
generous
instincts
than
the
five
towns
it
was
merely
a
primitive
striving
to
conceal
itself
beneath
breezy
disdain
for
those
more
highly
developed
manners
which
it
read
about
with
industry
and
joy
in
the
weekly
papers
but
which
it
lacked
the
courage
to
imitate
the
of
the
orgreave
household
had
been
a
hard
blow
to
the
cult
of
hospitality
in
bleakridge
lane
end
house
in
the
old
days
was
a
creative
centre
of
hospitality
for
the
force
of
example
the
desire
to
emulate
and
the
necessity
of
paying
in
kind
for
what
one
has
permitted
oneself
to
receive
will
make
hosts
of
those
who
by
their
own
initiative
would
never
have
sent
out
an
invitation
when
the
orgreaves
vanished
sundry
persons
in
bleakridge
were
discouraged
and
particularly
edwin
and
hilda
whose
musical
evenings
had
never
recovered
from
the
effect
of
the
circumstances
of
the
first
one
they
entertained
only
by
fits
and
starts
when
hilda
happened
to
remember
that
she
held
a
high
position
in
the
suburb
hilda
was
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
she
could
not
easily
strike
up
friendships
with
other
women
she
had
had
one
friend
and
after
janet
s
departure
she
had
fully
confided
in
no
woman
moreover
it
was
only
at
intervals
that
hilda
felt
the
need
of
companionship
her
present
party
was
due
chiefly
to
what
edwin
in
his
more
bitter
moods
would
have
called
snobbishness
partly
a
sudden
resolve
not
to
be
outshone
by
the
swetnams
who
in
recent
years
as
the
younger
generation
of
the
family
grew
up
had
beyond
doubt
increased
their
ascendancy
and
partly
the
desire
to
render
memorable
the
last
months
of
her
residence
in
bleakridge
the
list
of
hilda
s
guests
and
the
names
absent
from
it
gave
an
indication
of
the
trend
of
social
history
the
benbows
were
not
asked
the
relations
of
the
two
families
remained
as
friendly
as
ever
they
were
but
the
real
breach
between
them
caused
by
profound
differences
of
taste
and
intelligence
was
now
complete
maggie
would
have
been
asked
had
she
not
refused
in
advance
from
a
motive
of
shyness
in
all
essential
respects
maggie
had
been
annexed
by
clara
and
albert
she
had
given
up
auntie
hamps
s
house
of
which
the
furniture
had
been
either
appropriated
or
sold
and
gone
to
live
with
the
benbows
as
a
working
aunt
this
in
spite
of
albert
s
default
in
the
matter
of
interest
she
forewent
her
rights
slept
in
a
small
room
with
amy
paid
a
share
of
the
household
expenses
and
did
the
work
of
a
nursemaid
and
servant
combined
simply
because
she
was
maggie
she
might
had
she
chosen
have
lived
in
magnificence
with
the
clayhangers
but
she
would
not
face
the
intellectual
and
social
strain
of
doing
so
jim
orgreave
was
not
invited
briefly
he
had
become
impossible
though
he
was
still
more
strange
tom
orgreave
and
his
wife
had
only
been
invited
after
some
discussion
and
had
declined
tom
was
growing
extraordinarily
secretive
solitary
and
mysterious
it
was
reported
that
tom
had
neither
servant
nor
nursemaid
and
that
she
dared
not
ask
her
husband
for
money
to
buy
clothes
yet
edwin
and
tom
when
they
met
in
the
street
always
stopped
for
a
talk
generally
about
books
daisy
marrion
who
said
openly
that
tom
and
tom
were
a
huge
disappointment
to
everybody
was
invited
and
she
accepted
janet
orgreave
had
arrived
in
bursley
on
a
visit
to
the
clayhangers
on
the
very
day
of
the
party
the
cheswardines
were
asked
mainly
on
account
of
stephen
whose
bluff
utterly
unintellectual
profound
and
whose
adoration
of
his
wife
were
gradually
endearing
him
to
the
perceptive
and
fearns
were
requested
to
bring
their
daughter
annunciata
now
almost
marriageable
and
also
mademoiselle
renée
souchon
the
french
governess
newly
arrived
in
the
district
of
the
fearns
younger
children
folks
hinted
their
astonishment
that
alma
fearns
should
have
been
imprudent
enough
to
put
so
exotic
a
woman
under
the
same
roof
with
her
husband
ingpen
needed
no
invitation
nothing
could
occur
at
the
clayhangers
without
him
doctor
stirling
was
the
other
mature
bachelor
finally
in
the
catalogue
were
four
swetnams
the
vigorous
and
acute
sarah
who
was
a
mere
acquaintance
aged
tom
swetnam
and
two
younger
brothers
tom
had
to
bring
with
him
the
prime
excuse
for
the
party
namely
miss
manna
höst
of
copenhagen
to
whom
hilda
intended
to
show
that
the
swetnams
were
not
the
only
people
on
earth
there
were
thus
eight
women
eight
men
who
had
put
on
evening
dress
out
of
respect
for
the
foreigner
and
george
at
eleven
o
clock
when
the
musical
part
of
the
entertainment
was
over
miss
höst
had
already
fully
secured
for
herself
the
position
which
later
she
was
to
hold
as
the
wife
of
tom
swetnam
bleakridge
had
been
asked
to
meet
her
and
inspect
her
and
the
opinion
of
bleakridge
was
soon
formed
that
copenhagen
must
be
a
wondrous
and
a
romantic
place
and
that
tom
swetnam
knew
his
way
about
in
the
earliest
years
when
the
tourist
agencies
first
discovered
the
advertising
value
of
the
phrase
land
of
the
midnight
sun
tom
the
adventurous
had
made
the
scandinavian
round
trip
and
each
subsequent
summer
he
had
gone
off
again
in
the
same
direction
the
serpents
of
the
hanbridge
and
the
bursley
conservative
clubs
and
of
the
bar
of
the
five
towns
hotel
had
wagered
that
there
was
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
it
there
was
he
had
met
her
at
marienlyst
the
near
helsingor
called
by
the
tourist
agencies
elsinore
manna
höst
was
tall
and
athletically
slim
and
more
blonde
than
any
girl
ever
before
seen
in
the
five
towns
she
had
golden
hair
and
she
wore
white
it
was
understood
that
she
spoke
danish
swedish
and
norwegian
she
talked
french
with
facility
to
renée
souchon
and
tom
said
that
her
knowledge
of
german
surpassed
her
knowledge
of
either
french
or
english
she
spoke
english
excellently
with
a
quaint
endearing
accent
but
with
correctness
sometimes
she
would
use
an
idiom
picked
up
from
the
swetnam
boys
exquisitely
unaware
that
it
was
not
quite
suited
to
the
lips
of
a
young
woman
in
a
strange
her
innocence
however
purified
it
she
sang
classical
songs
in
german
with
dramatic
force
and
she
could
play
accompaniments
she
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
all
the
music
haltingly
performed
by
ingpen
janet
annunciata
and
young
george
ingpen
was
very
seriously
interested
in
her
views
thereon
she
knew
about
the
french
authors
from
whose
works
renée
souchon
chose
her
recitations
and
standing
up
at
the
buffet
table
in
the
she
had
fabricated
astounding
sandwiches
in
the
danish
style
she
stated
that
danish
cooks
reckoned
sorts
of
sandwiches
she
said
in
her
light
eager
voice
apropos
of
cooking
there
is
one
thing
i
can
not
understand
i
can
not
understand
why
you
english
throw
your
potatoes
to
melt
in
cold
water
for
an
hour
before
you
boil
them
nor
i
interjected
renée
souchon
no
other
woman
standing
round
the
table
had
ever
conceived
the
propriety
of
boiling
potatoes
without
first
soaking
them
in
cold
water
and
manna
was
requested
to
explain
because
she
said
it
it
lets
go
the
salts
of
potassium
which
are
so
necessary
for
the
pheesical
of
the
body
whereupon
tertius
ingpen
had
been
taken
by
one
of
his
long
laughs
a
laugh
that
ended
by
his
being
bent
nearly
double
below
the
level
of
the
table
everybody
was
much
impressed
and
ingpen
himself
not
the
least
ingpen
wondered
what
a
girl
so
complex
could
see
in
a
man
like
tom
swetnam
who
although
he
could
talk
about
the
arts
had
no
real
feeling
for
any
of
them
but
what
impressed
the
company
even
more
than
miss
höst
s
accomplishments
was
the
candid
fervour
of
her
comprehensive
interest
in
life
which
was
absolutely
without
or
fear
she
talked
with
the
same
disarming
ingenuous
eager
directness
to
charles
fearns
the
secret
rake
to
his
wife
the
ageing
and
mother
of
a
family
to
renée
souchon
who
despite
her
plainness
and
her
rumoured
bigotry
seemed
to
attract
all
the
men
in
the
room
by
something
provocative
in
her
eye
and
the
carriage
of
her
hips
to
the
simple
and
powerful
stephen
cheswardine
to
vera
the
delicious
and
elegant
cat
to
doctor
stirling
with
his
scotch
mysticism
and
to
tertius
ingpen
the
connoisseur
and
avowed
bachelor
she
spoke
to
hilda
janet
and
daisy
marrion
as
one
member
of
a
secret
sisterhood
to
other
members
to
annunciata
as
a
young
girl
and
to
george
as
an
initiated
sister
she
left
them
to
turn
to
edwin
with
a
trustful
glance
as
to
one
whose
special
reliability
she
had
divined
from
the
first
have
a
liqueur
miss
höst
edwin
enjoined
her
in
a
moment
she
was
sipping
chartreuse
i
love
it
she
murmured
but
somehow
beneath
all
such
freedoms
and
frankness
she
did
not
cease
to
be
a
maiden
with
reserves
of
mystery
her
assumption
that
nobody
could
misinterpret
her
demeanour
was
remarkable
to
the
english
observers
and
far
more
so
to
renée
souchon
all
gazed
at
her
piquant
blonde
face
scarcely
pretty
with
its
ardent
restless
eyes
and
felt
the
startling
compliment
of
her
quick
searching
sympathy
and
she
tinglingly
aware
of
her
success
proved
easily
equal
to
the
ordeal
of
it
only
at
rare
intervals
did
she
give
a
look
at
the
betrothed
as
if
for
confirmation
of
her
security
as
for
tom
he
was
positively
somewhat
unnerved
by
the
brilliance
of
the
performance
he
left
her
alone
without
guidance
as
a
who
should
stand
aside
during
a
turn
and
say
see
this
marvel
i
am
no
longer
necessary
when
people
glanced
at
him
after
one
of
her
effects
he
would
glance
modestly
away
striving
to
hide
from
them
his
illusion
that
he
himself
had
created
the
bewitching
girl
at
half
past
eleven
when
the
entire
assemblage
passed
into
the
she
dropped
on
to
the
and
began
a
waldteufel
waltz
with
irresistible
seductiveness
hilda
s
heart
leaped
in
a
minute
the
carpet
was
up
and
the
night
which
all
had
supposed
to
be
at
an
end
began
at
nearly
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
party
was
moving
strongly
by
its
own
acquired
momentum
and
needed
neither
the
invigoration
nor
the
guidance
which
hosts
often
are
compelled
to
give
hilda
having
finished
a
schottische
with
stirling
missed
janet
from
the
leaving
the
room
in
search
of
her
she
saw
edwin
with
tom
swetnam
and
the
glowing
manna
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
hello
she
called
out
what
are
you
folks
doing
manna
s
light
laugh
descended
like
a
shower
of
crystals
just
taking
a
constitutional
edwin
answered
hilda
waved
to
them
in
passing
she
was
extremely
elated
among
other
agreeable
incidents
was
the
success
of
her
new
black
lace
frock
edwin
s
voice
pleased
her
it
was
so
calm
wise
and
kind
and
at
the
same
time
mysteriously
ironical
she
occasionally
admitted
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
when
edwin
was
in
high
spirits
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
explore
completely
the
more
withdrawn
arcana
of
his
nature
he
had
behaved
with
perfection
that
evening
she
admitted
that
he
was
the
basis
of
the
evening
that
without
him
she
could
never
have
such
triumphs
it
was
strange
that
a
man
by
spending
so
many
hours
per
day
at
a
works
could
create
the
complicated
ease
and
luxury
of
a
home
she
perceived
how
steadily
and
surely
he
had
progressed
since
their
marriage
and
how
his
cautiousness
always
justified
itself
and
how
he
had
done
all
that
he
had
said
he
would
do
and
she
had
a
vision
of
that
same
miraculous
creative
force
of
his
at
work
by
her
volition
in
the
near
future
upon
ladderedge
hall
her
mood
became
a
strange
compound
of
humility
before
him
and
of
pride
in
her
own
power
to
influence
him
in
the
boudoir
janet
was
reclining
in
the
sole
easy
chair
dressed
in
grey
she
had
abandoned
white
she
was
as
slim
as
ever
and
did
not
look
her
age
with
face
flushed
eyes
glinting
under
drooping
lids
and
bosom
heaving
rather
quickly
she
might
have
passed
in
the
for
a
young
married
woman
still
under
the
excitement
of
matrimony
instead
of
a
virgin
of
forty
i
was
so
done
up
i
had
to
come
and
hide
myself
she
murmured
in
a
dreamy
tone
well
of
course
you
ve
had
the
journey
and
everything
i
never
did
come
across
such
a
dancer
as
charles
fearns
janet
went
on
yes
said
hilda
standing
with
her
back
to
the
fire
with
one
hand
on
the
mantelpiece
he
s
a
great
dancer
or
at
least
he
makes
you
think
so
but
i
m
sure
he
s
a
bad
man
yes
i
suppose
he
is
janet
agreed
with
a
sigh
neither
of
the
women
spoke
for
a
moment
and
each
looked
away
through
the
closed
door
came
the
muffled
sound
the
piano
played
by
annunciata
no
melody
was
distinguishable
only
the
percussion
of
the
bass
chords
beating
out
the
time
of
a
new
mazurka
it
was
as
if
the
whole
house
faintly
but
passionately
pulsed
in
the
fever
of
the
dance
i
see
you
ve
got
a
rossetti
said
janet
at
last
fingering
a
blue
volume
that
lay
on
the
desk
edwin
gave
it
me
hilda
replied
he
s
gradually
giving
me
all
my
private
poets
but
somehow
i
haven
t
been
able
to
read
much
lately
i
expect
it
s
the
idea
of
moving
into
the
country
that
makes
me
restless
but
is
it
settled
all
that
of
course
it
s
settled
my
dear
i
m
determined
to
take
him
away
hilda
spoke
of
her
husband
as
of
a
parcel
or
an
intelligent
bear
on
a
chain
as
loving
wives
may
right
out
of
all
this
i
m
sure
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
him
he
doesn
t
mind
really
he
s
promised
me
only
he
wants
to
make
sure
of
either
selling
or
letting
this
house
first
he
s
always
very
cautious
edwin
is
he
simply
hates
doing
a
thing
straight
off
yes
he
is
rather
that
way
inclined
said
janet
i
wanted
him
to
take
ladderedge
at
once
even
if
we
didn
t
move
into
it
anyhow
we
couldn
t
move
into
it
immediately
because
of
the
repairs
and
things
they
ll
take
a
fine
time
i
know
we
can
get
it
for
sixty
pounds
a
year
and
what
s
sixty
pounds
more
or
less
to
edwin
it
s
no
more
than
what
the
rent
of
this
house
would
be
but
no
he
wouldn
t
he
must
see
where
he
stands
with
this
house
before
he
does
anything
else
you
can
t
alter
him
you
know
the
door
was
cautiously
pushed
and
ingpen
entered
so
you
re
discussing
her
he
said
low
with
a
satiric
grin
discussing
who
hilda
sharply
demanded
you
know
tertius
said
hilda
you
re
worse
than
a
woman
he
giggled
with
delight
i
suppose
you
mean
that
to
be
very
severe
if
you
want
to
know
we
were
talking
about
ladderedge
so
apologise
added
janet
sitting
up
ingpen
s
face
straightened
and
he
began
to
tap
his
teeth
with
his
thumb
curious
that
s
just
what
i
came
in
about
i
ve
been
trying
to
get
a
chance
to
tell
you
all
the
evening
there
s
somebody
else
after
ladderedge
a
man
from
axe
he
s
been
to
look
over
it
twice
this
week
i
thought
i
d
tip
you
the
wink
hilda
stood
erect
putting
her
shoulders
back
have
you
told
edwin
she
asked
very
curtly
yes
what
did
he
say
he
said
it
was
only
a
dodge
of
the
s
to
quicken
things
up
and
do
you
think
it
is
well
i
doubt
it
ingpen
answered
apprehensively
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
warn
you
his
lordship
being
what
he
is
voices
including
edwin
s
could
be
heard
in
the
hall
here
i
m
not
going
to
be
caught
conspiring
with
you
ingpen
whispered
it
s
more
than
my
place
is
worth
and
he
departed
the
voices
receded
and
hilda
noiselessly
shut
the
door
everything
was
now
changed
for
her
by
a
tremendous
revulsion
the
beating
of
the
measure
of
the
mazurka
seemed
horrible
and
maddening
her
thought
was
directed
upon
edwin
with
the
cold
fury
of
which
only
love
is
capable
it
was
not
his
fault
that
some
rival
was
nibbling
at
ladderedge
but
it
was
his
fault
that
ladderedge
should
still
be
in
peril
she
saw
all
her
grandiose
plan
ruined
she
felt
sure
that
the
rival
was
powerful
and
determined
and
that
edwin
would
let
him
win
either
by
failing
to
bid
against
him
or
by
mere
ladderedge
was
not
the
only
suitable
country
residence
in
the
county
there
were
doubtless
many
others
but
ladderedge
was
just
what
she
wanted
and
more
important
with
her
it
had
become
a
symbol
she
had
a
misgiving
that
if
they
did
not
get
ladderedge
they
would
remain
in
trafalgar
road
bursley
for
ever
and
ever
yet
angry
and
desperate
though
she
was
she
somehow
did
not
accuse
and
arraign
edwin
any
more
than
she
would
have
accused
and
arraigned
a
climate
he
was
in
fact
the
climate
in
which
she
lived
a
moment
ago
she
had
said
you
can
t
alter
him
but
now
all
the
energy
of
her
volition
cried
out
that
he
must
be
altered
my
girl
she
said
turning
to
janet
do
you
think
you
can
stand
a
scene
a
scene
janet
repeated
the
word
guardedly
the
look
on
hilda
s
face
somewhat
alarmed
her
between
edwin
and
me
i
m
absolutely
determined
that
we
shall
take
ladderedge
and
i
don
t
care
how
much
of
a
row
we
have
over
it
it
isn
t
as
bad
as
all
that
janet
softly
murmured
with
her
skill
to
soothe
yes
it
is
said
hilda
violently
i
was
wondering
the
other
day
after
one
of
your
letters
janet
proceeded
gently
why
after
all
you
were
so
anxious
to
go
into
the
country
i
thought
you
wanted
edwin
to
be
on
the
town
council
or
something
of
that
kind
how
can
he
do
that
if
you
re
right
away
at
a
place
like
stockbrook
so
i
should
like
him
to
be
on
the
town
council
but
all
i
really
want
is
to
get
him
away
from
his
business
you
don
t
know
janet
she
spoke
bitterly
and
with
emotion
nobody
knows
except
me
he
ll
soon
be
the
slave
of
his
business
if
he
keeps
on
oh
i
don
t
mean
he
stays
at
nights
at
it
he
scarcely
ever
does
but
he
s
always
thinking
about
it
he
simply
can
t
bear
being
a
minute
late
for
it
everything
must
give
way
to
it
he
takes
that
as
a
matter
of
course
and
that
s
what
annoys
me
especially
as
there
s
no
reason
for
it
seeing
how
much
he
trusts
big
james
and
simpson
i
believe
he
d
do
anything
for
big
james
he
d
listen
to
big
james
far
sooner
than
he
d
listen
to
me
disagreeable
fawning
old
man
and
quite
stupid
simpson
isn
t
so
bad
i
tell
you
edwin
only
looks
on
his
home
as
a
nice
place
to
be
quiet
in
when
he
isn
t
at
the
works
i
ve
never
told
him
so
and
i
don
t
think
he
suspects
it
but
i
will
tell
him
one
of
these
days
he
s
very
good
edwin
is
in
all
the
little
things
he
always
tries
to
be
just
but
he
isn
t
just
in
the
big
thing
he
s
most
frightfully
unjust
i
sometimes
wonder
where
he
imagines
i
come
in
of
course
he
d
do
any
mortal
thing
for
me
except
spare
half
a
minute
from
the
works
what
do
i
care
about
money
i
don
t
care
that
much
about
money
when
there
s
money
i
can
spend
it
that
s
all
but
i
d
prefer
to
be
poor
and
him
to
be
rude
and
cross
and
impatient
which
he
scarcely
ever
is
than
have
this
feeling
all
the
time
that
it
s
the
works
first
and
everything
else
second
i
don
t
mind
for
myself
no
really
i
don
t
at
least
very
little
but
i
do
mind
for
him
i
call
it
humiliating
for
a
man
to
get
like
that
it
puts
everything
upside
down
look
at
stephen
cheswardine
for
instance
there
s
a
pretty
specimen
and
edwin
ll
be
as
bad
as
him
soon
but
everyone
says
how
fond
stephen
is
of
his
wife
and
isn
t
edwin
fond
of
me
stephen
cheswardine
despises
his
wife
only
he
can
t
do
without
her
that
s
all
and
he
treats
her
accordingly
and
i
shall
be
the
same
oh
hilda
yes
i
shall
yes
i
shall
but
i
won
t
have
it
i
d
as
lief
be
married
to
a
man
like
charles
fearns
he
isn
t
a
slave
to
his
business
anyhow
i
shall
get
edwin
further
away
and
when
i
ve
got
him
away
i
shall
see
he
doesn
t
go
to
the
works
on
saturdays
too
i
ve
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
that
and
if
he
isn
t
on
the
town
council
he
can
be
on
the
county
council
that
s
quite
as
good
i
hope
never
before
had
hilda
spoken
so
freely
to
anyone
not
even
to
janet
fierce
pride
had
always
kept
her
but
now
she
had
no
feeling
of
shame
at
her
outburst
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
yet
she
faced
janet
making
no
effort
to
hide
them
my
dear
breathed
the
deprecating
janet
shocked
out
of
her
tepid
virginal
calm
by
a
revelation
of
conjugal
misery
such
as
had
never
been
vouchsafed
to
her
she
was
thinking
how
can
the
poor
thing
face
her
guests
after
this
everybody
will
see
that
something
s
happened
it
will
be
awful
she
really
ought
to
think
of
her
position
there
was
a
silence
the
door
opened
with
a
sharp
sound
and
hilda
turned
away
her
head
as
from
the
suddenly
visible
mouth
of
a
cannon
the
music
could
be
heard
plainly
and
beneath
it
the
dull
shuffling
of
feet
on
the
bare
boards
of
the
manna
höst
came
in
radiant
followed
by
edwin
and
tom
swetnam
well
hilda
said
edwin
with
a
slight
timid
constraint
i
ve
got
rid
of
your
house
for
you
here
are
the
deluded
victims
we
have
seen
every
corner
of
it
clayhanger
said
manna
höst
enthusiastically
it
is
lovely
but
how
can
you
wish
to
leave
it
it
is
so
practical
perceiving
the
agitation
of
hilda
s
face
edwin
added
in
a
lower
voice
to
his
wife
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
say
anything
until
it
was
settled
for
fear
you
might
be
let
in
for
a
disappointment
he
ll
buy
it
if
i
leave
fifteen
hundred
on
mortgage
so
i
shall
but
of
course
he
wanted
her
to
have
a
good
look
at
it
first
how
unfair
i
am
thought
hilda
as
she
made
some
banal
remark
to
miss
höst
don
t
i
know
i
can
always
rely
on
him
clayhanger
made
us
promise
not
to
miss
höst
began
to
explain
it
was
just
like
him
hilda
interrupted
smiling
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
jump
at
edwin
and
kiss
him
she
was
saved
her
grandiose
plan
would
proceed
the
house
sold
edwin
was
bound
to
secure
ladderedge
hall
against
no
matter
what
rival
and
he
would
do
it
but
it
was
the
realisation
of
her
power
over
her
husband
that
gave
her
the
profoundest
joy
about
an
hour
later
when
everyone
felt
that
the
party
was
over
the
guests
reluctant
to
leave
and
excited
afresh
by
the
news
that
the
house
had
changed
hands
during
the
revel
were
all
assembled
in
the
a
few
were
seated
on
the
chairs
which
with
the
tables
had
been
pushed
against
the
walls
george
had
squatted
on
the
carpet
rolled
up
into
the
hearth
where
the
fire
was
extinct
he
was
not
wearing
his
green
shade
the
rest
were
grouped
around
manna
höst
in
the
middle
of
the
room
miss
höst
the
future
mistress
of
the
abode
was
now
more
than
ever
the
centre
of
regard
apparently
as
fresh
as
at
the
start
and
picking
delicately
at
a
sweet
biscuit
the
flushed
blonde
stood
answering
questions
about
her
views
on
england
and
especially
on
the
five
towns
she
was
quite
sure
of
herself
and
utterly
charming
in
her
confidence
annunciata
fearns
envied
her
acutely
the
other
women
were
a
little
saddened
by
the
thought
of
all
the
disillusions
that
inevitably
lay
before
her
it
was
touching
to
see
her
glance
at
tom
swetnam
convinced
that
she
understood
him
to
the
core
and
in
him
all
the
psychology
of
his
sex
everybody
knows
she
was
saying
that
the
english
are
the
finest
nation
and
i
think
the
five
towns
are
much
more
english
than
london
that
s
why
i
adore
the
five
towns
you
do
not
know
how
english
you
are
here
it
makes
me
laugh
because
you
are
so
english
and
you
do
not
know
it
i
love
you
you
re
flattering
us
said
stephen
cheswardine
enchanted
with
the
girl
everybody
waited
in
eager
delight
for
her
next
words
such
of
attention
and
laudation
did
not
often
fall
to
the
district
it
occurred
to
people
that
after
all
the
local
might
not
be
entirely
unjustified
ah
manna
pouted
but
you
have
spots
spots
repeated
young
paul
swetnam
amid
a
general
laugh
she
turned
to
him
you
said
there
were
no
spots
on
knype
football
club
did
you
not
well
there
is
a
spot
on
you
english
you
are
dreadfully
exasperating
to
us
danes
oh
i
mean
it
you
are
exasperating
because
you
will
not
show
your
feelings
tom
that
must
be
one
for
you
said
charlie
fearns
we
re
too
proud
said
stirling
no
replied
manna
maliciously
it
is
not
pride
you
are
afraid
to
show
your
feelings
it
is
because
you
are
cowards
in
that
we
aren
t
cried
hilda
inspired
and
yielding
to
the
temptation
which
had
troubled
her
incessantly
ever
since
she
left
the
boudoir
she
put
her
arms
round
edwin
and
kissed
him
so
there
loud
applause
said
young
george
on
the
roll
of
carpet
he
said
it
kindly
but
with
a
certain
superiority
perhaps
due
to
the
facts
that
he
was
wearing
a
man
s
long
trousers
for
the
first
time
that
night
and
that
he
regarded
himself
as
already
almost
a
londoner
there
was
some
handclapping
edwin
s
eyes
had
seduced
hilda
looking
at
them
surreptitiously
she
had
suddenly
recalled
another
of
his
tricks
tricks
of
goodness
when
she
had
told
him
one
evening
that
minnie
was
prematurely
the
mother
of
a
girl
he
had
said
well
we
ll
put
in
the
savings
bank
for
the
kid
whatever
are
you
talking
about
i
received
it
from
america
this
very
morning
as
ever
is
and
he
showed
her
a
draft
on
brown
shipley
co
he
said
from
he
was
too
delicate
to
say
from
george
it
had
been
a
triumphant
moment
for
him
and
now
as
before
them
all
hilda
held
him
to
her
the
delicious
thought
that
she
had
power
over
him
that
she
was
shaping
the
large
contours
of
his
existence
made
her
feel
solemn
in
her
bliss
and
yet
simultaneously
she
was
reflecting
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
hardness
it
s
each
for
himself
in
marriage
after
all
and
i
ve
got
my
own
way
and
then
she
noticed
the
whiteness
of
his
under
her
chin
and
that
reminded
her
of
his
mania
for
arranging
his
linen
according
to
his
own
ideas
in
his
own
drawer
and
the
absurd
tidiness
of
his
linen
and
she
wanted
to
laugh
what
a
romance
she
has
made
of
my
life
thought
edwin
confused
and
blushing
as
she
loosed
him
and
though
he
looked
round
with
affection
at
the
walls
which
would
soon
no
longer
be
his
the
greatness
of
the
adventure
of
existence
with
this
creature
to
him
unique
and
the
eternal
expectation
of
some
new
ecstasy
left
no
room
in
his
heart
for
a
regret
he
caught
sight
of
ingpen
alone
in
a
corner
by
the
piano
nervously
stroking
his
silky
beard
the
memory
of
the
secret
woman
in
ingpen
s
room
came
back
to
him
without
any
process
of
reasoning
he
felt
very
sorry
for
both
of
them
and
he
was
aware
of
a
certain
condescension
in
himself
towards
ingpen
