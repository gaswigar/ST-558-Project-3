the
atheist
mass

honore
de
balzac
translated
by
clara
bell
this
is
dedicated
to
auguste
borget
by
his
friend
de
balzac
the
atheist
mass
bianchon
a
physician
to
whom
science
owes
a
fine
system
of
theoretical
physiology
and
who
while
still
young
made
himself
a
celebrity
in
the
medical
school
of
paris
that
central
luminary
to
which
european
doctors
do
homage
practised
surgery
for
a
long
time
before
he
took
up
medicine
his
earliest
studies
were
guided
by
one
of
the
greatest
of
french
surgeons
the
illustrious
desplein
who
flashed
across
science
like
a
meteor
by
the
consensus
even
of
his
enemies
he
took
with
him
to
the
tomb
an
incommunicable
method
like
all
men
of
genius
he
had
no
heirs
he
carried
everything
in
him
and
carried
it
away
with
him
the
glory
of
a
surgeon
is
like
that
of
an
actor
they
live
only
so
long
as
they
are
alive
and
their
talent
leaves
no
trace
when
they
are
gone
actors
and
surgeons
like
great
singers
too
like
the
executants
who
by
their
performance
increase
the
power
of
music
tenfold
are
all
the
heroes
of
a
moment
desplein
is
a
case
in
proof
of
this
resemblance
in
the
destinies
of
such
transient
genius
his
name
yesterday
so
famous
almost
forgotten
will
survive
in
his
special
department
without
crossing
its
limits
for
must
there
not
be
some
extraordinary
circumstances
to
exalt
the
name
of
a
professor
from
the
history
of
science
to
the
general
history
of
the
human
race
had
desplein
that
universal
command
of
knowledge
which
makes
a
man
the
living
word
the
great
figure
of
his
age
desplein
had
a
godlike
eye
he
saw
into
the
sufferer
and
his
malady
by
an
intuition
natural
or
acquired
which
enabled
him
to
grasp
the
diagnostics
peculiar
to
the
individual
to
determine
the
very
time
the
hour
the
minute
when
an
operation
should
be
performed
making
due
allowance
for
atmospheric
conditions
and
peculiarities
of
individual
temperament
to
proceed
thus
hand
in
hand
with
nature
had
he
then
studied
the
constant
assimilation
by
living
beings
of
the
elements
contained
in
the
atmosphere
or
yielded
by
the
earth
to
man
who
absorbs
them
deriving
from
them
a
particular
expression
of
life
did
he
work
it
all
out
by
the
power
of
deduction
and
analogy
to
which
we
owe
the
genius
of
cuvier
be
this
as
it
may
this
man
was
in
all
the
secrets
of
the
human
frame
he
knew
it
in
the
past
and
in
the
future
emphasizing
the
present
but
did
he
epitomize
all
science
in
his
own
person
as
hippocrates
did
and
galen
and
aristotle
did
he
guide
a
whole
school
towards
new
worlds
no
though
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
this
persistent
observer
of
human
chemistry
possessed
that
antique
science
of
the
mages
that
is
to
say
knowledge
of
the
elements
in
fusion
the
causes
of
life
life
antecedent
to
life
and
what
it
must
be
in
its
incubation
or
ever
it
it
must
be
confessed
that
unfortunately
everything
in
him
was
purely
personal
isolated
during
his
life
by
his
egoism
that
egoism
is
now
suicidal
of
his
glory
on
his
tomb
there
is
no
proclaiming
statue
to
repeat
to
posterity
the
mysteries
which
genius
seeks
out
at
its
own
cost
but
perhaps
desplein
genius
was
answerable
for
his
beliefs
and
for
that
reason
mortal
to
him
the
terrestrial
atmosphere
was
a
generative
envelope
he
saw
the
earth
as
an
egg
within
its
shell
and
not
being
able
to
determine
whether
the
egg
or
the
hen
first
was
he
would
not
recognize
either
the
cock
or
the
egg
he
believed
neither
in
the
antecedent
animal
nor
the
surviving
spirit
of
man
desplein
had
no
doubts
he
was
positive
his
bold
and
unqualified
atheism
was
like
that
of
many
scientific
men
the
best
men
in
the
world
but
invincible
atheists
atheists
such
as
religious
people
declare
to
be
impossible
this
opinion
could
scarcely
exist
otherwise
in
a
man
who
was
accustomed
from
his
youth
to
dissect
the
creature
above
all
others
before
during
and
after
life
to
hunt
through
all
his
organs
without
ever
finding
the
individual
soul
which
is
indispensable
to
religious
theory
when
he
detected
a
cerebral
centre
a
nervous
centre
and
a
centre
for
aerating
the
blood
the
first
two
so
perfectly
complementary
that
in
the
latter
years
of
his
life
he
came
to
a
conviction
that
the
sense
of
hearing
is
not
absolutely
necessary
for
hearing
nor
the
sense
of
sight
for
seeing
and
that
the
solar
plexus
could
supply
their
place
without
any
possibility
of
doubt
desplein
thus
finding
two
souls
in
man
confirmed
his
atheism
by
this
fact
though
it
is
no
evidence
against
god
this
man
died
it
is
said
in
final
impenitence
as
do
unfortunately
many
noble
geniuses
whom
god
may
forgive
the
life
of
this
man
great
as
he
was
was
marred
by
many
meannesses
to
use
the
expression
employed
by
his
enemies
who
were
anxious
to
diminish
his
glory
but
which
it
would
be
more
proper
to
call
apparent
contradictions
envious
people
and
fools
having
no
knowledge
of
the
determinations
by
which
superior
spirits
are
moved
seize
at
once
on
superficial
inconsistencies
to
formulate
an
accusation
and
so
to
pass
sentence
on
them
if
subsequently
the
proceedings
thus
attacked
are
crowned
with
success
showing
the
correlations
of
the
preliminaries
and
the
results
a
few
of
the
vanguard
of
calumnies
always
survive
in
our
day
for
instance
napoleon
was
condemned
by
our
contemporaries
when
he
spread
his
eagle
wings
to
alight
in
england
only
could
explain
and
the
flatboats
at
boulogne
as
in
desplein
his
glory
and
science
were
invulnerable
his
enemies
attacked
his
odd
moods
and
his
temper
whereas
in
fact
he
was
simply
characterized
by
what
the
english
call
eccentricity
sometimes
very
handsomely
dressed
like
crebillon
the
tragical
he
would
suddenly
affect
extreme
indifference
as
to
what
he
wore
he
was
sometimes
seen
in
a
carriage
and
sometimes
on
foot
by
turns
rough
and
kind
harsh
and
covetous
on
the
surface
but
capable
of
offering
his
whole
fortune
to
his
exiled
masters
who
did
him
the
honor
of
accepting
it
for
a
few
days
no
man
ever
gave
rise
to
such
contradictory
judgements
although
to
obtain
a
black
ribbon
which
physicians
ought
not
to
intrigue
for
he
was
capable
of
dropping
a
out
of
his
pocket
at
court
in
his
heart
he
mocked
at
everything
he
had
a
deep
contempt
for
men
after
studying
them
from
above
and
below
after
detecting
their
genuine
expression
when
performing
the
most
solemn
and
the
meanest
acts
of
their
lives
the
qualities
of
a
great
man
are
often
federative
if
among
these
colossal
spirits
one
has
more
talent
than
wit
his
wit
is
still
superior
to
that
of
a
man
of
whom
it
is
simply
stated
that
he
is
witty
genius
always
presupposes
moral
insight
this
insight
may
be
applied
to
a
special
subject
but
he
who
can
see
a
flower
must
be
able
to
see
the
sun
the
man
who
on
hearing
a
diplomate
he
has
saved
ask
how
is
the
emperor
could
say
the
courtier
is
alive
the
man
will
follow
that
man
is
not
merely
a
surgeon
or
a
physician
he
is
prodigiously
witty
also
hence
a
patient
and
diligent
student
of
human
nature
will
admit
desplein
exorbitant
pretensions
and
believe
as
he
himself
believed
that
he
might
have
been
no
less
great
as
a
minister
than
he
was
as
a
surgeon
among
the
riddles
which
desplein
life
presents
to
many
of
his
contemporaries
we
have
chosen
one
of
the
most
interesting
because
the
answer
is
to
be
found
at
the
end
of
the
narrative
and
will
avenge
him
for
some
foolish
charges
of
all
the
students
in
desplein
hospital
horace
bianchon
was
one
of
those
to
whom
he
most
warmly
attached
himself
before
being
a
house
surgeon
at
the
horace
bianchon
had
been
a
medical
student
lodging
in
a
squalid
boarding
house
in
the
known
as
the
maison
vauquer
this
poor
young
man
had
felt
there
the
gnawing
of
that
burning
poverty
which
is
a
sort
of
crucible
from
which
great
talents
are
to
emerge
as
pure
and
incorruptible
as
diamonds
which
may
be
subjected
to
any
shock
without
being
crushed
in
the
fierce
fire
of
their
unbridled
passions
they
acquire
the
most
impeccable
honesty
and
get
into
the
habit
of
fighting
the
battles
which
await
genius
with
the
constant
work
by
which
they
coerce
their
cheated
appetites
horace
was
an
upright
young
fellow
incapable
of
tergiversation
on
a
matter
of
honor
going
to
the
point
without
waste
of
words
and
as
ready
to
pledge
his
cloak
for
a
friend
as
to
give
him
his
time
and
his
night
hours
horace
in
short
was
one
of
those
friends
who
are
never
anxious
as
to
what
they
may
get
in
return
for
what
they
give
feeling
sure
that
they
will
in
their
turn
get
more
than
they
give
most
of
his
friends
felt
for
him
that
respect
which
is
inspired
by
unostentatious
virtue
and
many
of
them
dreaded
his
censure
but
horace
made
no
pedantic
display
of
his
qualities
he
was
neither
a
puritan
nor
a
preacher
he
could
swear
with
a
grace
as
he
gave
his
advice
and
was
always
ready
for
a
jollification
when
occasion
offered
a
jolly
companion
not
more
prudish
than
a
trooper
as
frank
and
outspoken
not
as
a
sailor
for
nowadays
sailors
are
wily
diplomates
but
as
an
honest
man
who
has
nothing
in
his
life
to
hide
he
walked
with
his
head
erect
and
a
mind
content
in
short
to
put
the
facts
into
a
word
horace
was
the
pylades
of
more
than
one
orestes
creditors
being
regarded
as
the
nearest
modern
equivalent
to
the
furies
of
the
ancients
he
carried
his
poverty
with
the
cheerfulness
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
chief
elements
of
courage
and
like
all
people
who
have
nothing
he
made
very
few
debts
as
sober
as
a
camel
and
active
as
a
stag
he
was
steadfast
in
his
ideas
and
his
conduct
the
happy
phase
of
bianchon
life
began
on
the
day
when
the
famous
surgeon
had
proof
of
the
qualities
and
the
defects
which
these
no
less
than
those
make
doctor
horace
bianchon
doubly
dear
to
his
friends
when
a
leading
clinical
practitioner
takes
a
young
man
to
his
bosom
that
young
man
has
as
they
say
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
desplein
did
not
fail
to
take
bianchon
as
his
assistant
to
wealthy
houses
where
some
complimentary
fee
almost
always
found
its
way
into
the
student
pocket
and
where
the
mysteries
of
paris
life
were
insensibly
revealed
to
the
young
provincial
he
kept
him
at
his
side
when
a
consultation
was
to
be
held
and
gave
him
occupation
sometimes
he
would
send
him
to
a
with
a
rich
patient
in
fact
he
was
making
a
practice
for
him
the
consequence
was
that
in
the
course
of
time
the
tyrant
of
surgery
had
a
devoted
ally
these
two
men
one
at
the
summit
of
honor
and
of
his
science
enjoying
an
immense
fortune
and
an
immense
reputation
the
other
a
humble
omega
having
neither
fortune
nor
fame
became
intimate
friends
the
great
desplein
told
his
house
surgeon
everything
the
disciple
knew
whether
such
or
such
a
woman
had
sat
on
a
chair
near
the
master
or
on
the
famous
couch
in
desplein
surgery
on
which
he
slept
bianchon
knew
the
mysteries
of
that
temperament
a
compound
of
the
lion
and
the
bull
which
at
last
expanded
and
enlarged
beyond
measure
the
great
torso
and
caused
his
death
by
degeneration
of
the
heart
he
studied
the
eccentricities
of
that
busy
life
the
schemes
of
that
sordid
avarice
the
hopes
of
the
politician
who
lurked
behind
the
man
of
science
he
was
able
to
foresee
the
mortifications
that
awaited
the
only
sentiment
that
lay
hid
in
a
heart
that
was
steeled
but
not
of
steel
one
day
bianchon
spoke
to
desplein
of
a
poor
of
the
district
who
had
a
horrible
disease
caused
by
fatigue
and
want
this
wretched
auvergnat
had
had
nothing
but
potatoes
to
eat
during
the
dreadful
winter
of
desplein
left
all
his
visits
and
at
the
risk
of
killing
his
horse
he
rushed
off
followed
by
bianchon
to
the
poor
man
dwelling
and
saw
himself
to
his
being
removed
to
a
sick
house
founded
by
the
famous
dubois
in
the
faubourg
then
he
went
to
attend
the
man
and
when
he
had
cured
him
he
gave
him
the
necessary
sum
to
buy
a
horse
and
a
this
auvergnat
distinguished
himself
by
an
amusing
action
one
of
his
friends
fell
ill
and
he
took
him
at
once
to
desplein
saying
to
his
benefactor
i
could
not
have
borne
to
let
him
go
to
any
one
else
rough
customer
as
he
was
desplein
grasped
the
hand
and
said
bring
them
all
to
me
he
got
the
native
of
cantal
into
the
where
he
took
the
greatest
care
of
him
bianchon
had
already
observed
in
his
chief
a
predilection
for
auvergnats
and
especially
for
water
carriers
but
as
desplein
took
a
sort
of
pride
in
his
cures
at
the
the
pupil
saw
nothing
very
strange
in
that
one
day
as
he
crossed
the
place
bianchon
caught
sight
of
his
master
going
into
the
church
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
desplein
who
at
that
time
never
went
a
step
without
his
cab
was
on
foot
and
slipped
in
by
the
door
in
the
rue
du
as
if
he
were
stealing
into
some
house
of
ill
fame
the
house
surgeon
naturally
possessed
by
curiosity
knowing
his
master
opinions
and
being
himself
a
rabid
follower
of
cabanis
en
with
the
which
in
rabelais
seems
to
convey
an
intensity
of
devilry
bianchon
stole
into
the
church
and
was
not
a
little
astonished
to
see
the
great
desplein
the
atheist
who
had
no
mercy
on
the
angels
who
give
no
work
to
the
lancet
and
can
not
suffer
from
fistula
or
gastritis
in
short
this
audacious
scoffer
kneeling
humbly
and
where
in
the
lady
chapel
where
he
remained
through
the
mass
giving
alms
for
the
expenses
of
the
service
alms
for
the
poor
and
looking
as
serious
as
though
he
were
superintending
an
operation
he
has
certainly
not
come
here
to
clear
up
the
question
of
the
delivery
said
bianchon
to
himself
astonished
beyond
measure
if
i
had
caught
him
holding
one
of
the
ropes
of
the
canopy
on
corpus
christi
day
it
would
be
a
thing
to
laugh
at
but
at
this
hour
alone
with
no
one
to
see
it
is
surely
a
thing
to
marvel
at
bianchon
did
not
wish
to
seem
as
though
he
were
spying
the
head
surgeon
of
the
he
went
away
as
it
happened
desplein
asked
him
to
dine
with
him
that
day
not
at
his
own
house
but
at
a
restaurant
at
dessert
bianchon
skilfully
contrived
to
talk
of
the
mass
speaking
of
it
as
mummery
and
a
farce
a
farce
said
desplein
which
has
cost
christendom
more
blood
than
all
napoleon
battles
and
all
broussais
leeches
the
mass
is
a
papal
invention
not
older
than
the
sixth
century
and
based
on
the
est
what
floods
of
blood
were
shed
to
establish
the
the
festival
of
corpus
christi
the
institution
by
which
rome
established
her
triumph
in
the
question
of
the
real
presence
a
schism
which
rent
the
church
during
three
centuries
the
wars
of
the
count
of
toulouse
against
the
albigenses
were
the
tail
end
of
that
dispute
the
vaudois
and
the
albigenses
refused
to
recognize
this
innovation
in
short
desplein
was
delighted
to
disport
himself
in
his
most
atheistical
vein
a
flow
of
voltairean
satire
or
to
be
accurate
a
vile
imitation
of
the
hallo
where
is
my
worshiper
of
this
morning
said
bianchon
to
himself
he
said
nothing
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
had
really
seen
his
chief
at
desplein
would
not
have
troubled
himself
to
tell
bianchon
a
lie
they
knew
each
other
too
well
they
had
already
exchanged
thoughts
on
quite
equally
serious
subjects
and
discussed
systems
de
natura
rerum
probing
or
dissecting
them
with
the
knife
and
scalpel
of
incredulity
three
months
went
by
bianchon
did
not
attempt
to
follow
the
matter
up
though
it
remained
stamped
on
his
memory
one
day
that
year
one
of
the
physicians
of
the
took
desplein
by
the
arm
as
if
to
question
him
in
bianchon
presence
what
were
you
doing
at
my
dear
master
said
he
i
went
to
see
a
priest
who
has
a
diseased
and
to
whom
the
duchesse
did
me
the
honor
to
recommend
me
said
desplein
the
questioner
took
this
defeat
for
an
answer
not
so
bianchon
oh
he
goes
to
see
damaged
knees
in
church
he
went
to
mass
said
the
young
man
to
himself
bianchon
resolved
to
watch
desplein
he
remembered
the
day
and
hour
when
he
had
detected
him
going
into
and
resolved
to
be
there
again
next
year
on
the
same
day
and
at
the
same
hour
to
see
if
he
should
find
him
there
again
in
that
case
the
periodicity
of
his
devotion
would
justify
a
scientific
investigation
for
in
such
a
man
there
ought
to
be
no
direct
antagonism
of
thought
and
action
next
year
on
the
said
day
and
hour
bianchon
who
had
already
ceased
to
be
desplein
house
surgeon
saw
the
great
man
cab
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
tournon
and
the
rue
du
whence
his
friend
jesuitically
crept
along
by
the
wall
of
and
once
more
attended
mass
in
front
of
the
virgin
altar
it
was
desplein
sure
enough
the
the
atheist
at
heart
the
worshiper
by
chance
the
mystery
was
greater
than
ever
the
regularity
of
the
phenomenon
complicated
it
when
desplein
had
left
bianchon
went
to
the
sacristan
who
took
charge
of
the
chapel
and
asked
him
whether
the
gentleman
were
a
constant
worshiper
for
twenty
years
that
i
have
been
here
replied
the
man
desplein
has
come
four
times
a
year
to
attend
this
mass
he
founded
it
a
mass
founded
by
him
said
bianchon
as
he
went
away
this
is
as
great
a
mystery
as
the
immaculate
conception
an
article
which
alone
is
enough
to
make
a
physician
an
unbeliever
some
time
elapsed
before
doctor
bianchon
though
so
much
his
friend
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
desplein
of
this
incident
of
his
life
though
they
met
in
consultation
or
in
society
it
was
difficult
to
find
an
hour
of
confidential
solitude
when
sitting
with
their
feet
on
the
and
their
head
resting
on
the
back
of
an
armchair
two
men
tell
each
other
their
secrets
at
last
seven
years
later
after
the
revolution
of
when
the
mob
invaded
the
archbishop
residence
when
republican
agitators
spurred
them
on
to
destroy
the
gilt
crosses
which
flashed
like
streaks
of
lightning
in
the
immensity
of
the
ocean
of
houses
when
incredulity
flaunted
itself
in
the
streets
side
by
side
with
rebellion
bianchon
once
more
detected
desplein
going
into
the
doctor
followed
him
and
knelt
down
by
him
without
the
slightest
notice
or
demonstration
of
surprise
from
his
friend
they
both
attended
this
mass
of
his
founding
will
you
tell
me
my
dear
fellow
said
bianchon
as
they
left
the
church
the
reason
for
your
fit
of
monkishness
i
have
caught
you
three
times
going
to
mass
you
you
must
account
to
me
for
this
mystery
explain
such
a
flagrant
disagreement
between
your
opinions
and
your
conduct
you
do
not
believe
in
god
and
yet
you
attend
mass
my
dear
master
you
are
bound
to
give
me
an
answer
i
am
like
a
great
many
devout
people
men
who
on
the
surface
are
deeply
religious
but
quite
as
much
atheists
as
you
or
i
can
be
and
he
poured
out
a
torrent
of
epigrams
on
certain
political
personages
of
whom
the
best
known
gives
us
in
this
century
a
new
edition
of
moliere
all
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
question
retorted
bianchon
i
want
to
know
the
reason
for
what
you
have
just
been
doing
and
why
you
founded
this
mass
faith
my
dear
boy
said
desplein
i
am
on
the
verge
of
the
tomb
i
may
safely
tell
you
about
the
beginning
of
my
life
at
this
moment
bianchon
and
the
great
man
were
in
the
rue
des
one
of
the
worst
streets
in
paris
desplein
pointed
to
the
sixth
floor
of
one
of
the
houses
looking
like
obelisks
of
which
the
narrow
door
opens
into
a
passage
with
a
winding
staircase
at
the
end
with
windows
appropriately
termed
borrowed
lights
or
in
french
de
it
was
a
greenish
structure
the
ground
floor
occupied
by
a
while
each
floor
seemed
to
shelter
a
different
and
independent
form
of
misery
throwing
up
his
arm
with
a
vehement
gesture
desplein
exclaimed
i
lived
up
there
for
two
years
i
know
arthez
lived
there
i
went
up
there
almost
every
day
during
my
first
youth
we
used
to
call
it
then
the
of
great
men
what
then
the
mass
i
have
just
attended
is
connected
with
some
events
which
took
place
at
the
time
when
i
lived
in
the
garret
where
you
say
arthez
lived
the
one
with
the
window
where
the
clothes
line
is
hanging
with
linen
over
a
pot
of
flowers
my
early
life
was
so
hard
my
dear
bianchon
that
i
may
dispute
the
palm
of
paris
suffering
with
any
man
living
i
have
endured
everything
hunger
and
thirst
want
of
money
want
of
clothes
of
shoes
of
linen
every
cruelty
that
penury
can
inflict
i
have
blown
on
my
frozen
fingers
in
that
of
great
which
i
should
like
to
see
again
now
with
you
i
worked
through
a
whole
winter
seeing
my
head
steam
and
perceiving
the
atmosphere
of
my
own
moisture
as
we
see
that
of
horses
on
a
frosty
day
i
do
not
know
where
a
man
finds
the
fulcrum
that
enables
him
to
hold
out
against
such
a
life
i
was
alone
with
no
one
to
help
me
no
money
to
buy
books
or
to
pay
the
expenses
of
my
medical
training
i
had
not
a
friend
my
irascible
touchy
restless
temper
was
against
me
no
one
understood
that
this
irritability
was
the
distress
and
toil
of
a
man
who
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
is
struggling
to
reach
the
surface
still
i
had
as
i
may
say
to
you
before
whom
i
need
wear
no
draperies
i
had
that
of
good
feeling
and
keen
sensitiveness
which
must
always
be
the
birthright
of
any
man
who
is
strong
enough
to
climb
to
any
height
whatever
after
having
long
trampled
in
the
bogs
of
poverty
i
could
obtain
nothing
from
my
family
nor
from
my
home
beyond
my
inadequate
allowance
in
short
at
that
time
i
breakfasted
off
a
roll
which
the
baker
in
the
rue
du
sold
me
cheap
because
it
was
left
from
yesterday
or
the
day
before
and
i
crumbled
it
into
milk
thus
my
morning
meal
cost
me
but
two
sous
i
dined
only
every
other
day
in
a
where
the
meal
cost
me
sixteen
sous
you
know
as
well
as
i
what
care
i
must
have
taken
of
my
clothes
and
shoes
i
hardly
know
whether
in
later
life
we
feel
grief
so
deep
when
a
colleague
plays
us
false
as
we
have
known
you
and
i
on
detecting
the
mocking
smile
of
a
gaping
seam
in
a
shoe
or
hearing
the
armhole
of
a
coat
split
i
drank
nothing
but
water
i
regarded
a
cafe
with
distant
respect
seemed
to
me
a
promised
land
where
none
but
the
lucullus
of
the
had
a
right
of
entry
i
ever
take
a
cup
of
coffee
there
with
milk
in
it
said
i
to
myself
play
a
game
of
dominoes
i
threw
into
my
work
the
fury
i
felt
at
my
misery
i
tried
to
master
positive
knowledge
so
as
to
acquire
the
greatest
personal
value
and
merit
the
position
i
should
hold
as
soon
as
i
could
escape
from
nothingness
i
consumed
more
oil
than
bread
the
light
i
burned
during
these
endless
nights
cost
me
more
than
food
it
was
a
long
duel
obstinate
with
no
sort
of
consolation
i
found
no
sympathy
anywhere
to
have
friends
must
we
not
form
connections
with
young
men
have
a
few
sous
so
as
to
be
able
to
go
tippling
with
them
and
meet
them
where
students
congregate
and
i
had
nothing
and
no
one
in
paris
can
understand
that
nothing
means
when
i
even
thought
of
revealing
my
beggary
i
had
that
nervous
contraction
of
the
throat
which
makes
a
sick
man
believe
that
a
ball
rises
up
from
the
oesophagus
into
the
larynx
in
later
life
i
have
met
people
born
to
wealth
who
never
having
wanted
for
anything
had
never
even
heard
this
problem
in
the
rule
of
three
a
young
man
is
to
crime
as
a
piece
is
to
these
gilded
idiots
say
to
me
did
you
get
into
debt
why
did
you
involve
yourself
in
such
onerous
obligations
they
remind
me
of
the
princess
who
on
hearing
that
the
people
lacked
bread
said
do
not
they
buy
cakes
i
should
like
to
see
one
of
these
rich
men
who
complain
that
i
charge
too
much
for
an
operation
yes
i
should
like
to
see
him
alone
in
paris
without
a
sou
without
a
friend
without
credit
and
forced
to
work
with
his
five
fingers
to
live
at
all
what
would
he
do
where
would
he
go
to
satisfy
his
hunger
bianchon
if
you
have
sometimes
seen
me
hard
and
bitter
it
was
because
i
was
adding
my
early
sufferings
on
to
the
insensibility
the
selfishness
of
which
i
have
seen
thousands
of
instances
in
the
highest
circles
or
perhaps
i
was
thinking
of
the
obstacles
which
hatred
envy
jealousy
and
calumny
raised
up
between
me
and
success
in
paris
when
certain
people
see
you
ready
to
set
your
foot
in
the
stirrup
some
pull
your
others
loosen
the
buckle
of
the
strap
that
you
may
fall
and
crack
your
skull
one
wrenches
off
your
horse
shoes
another
steals
your
whip
and
the
least
treacherous
of
them
all
is
the
man
whom
you
see
coming
to
fire
his
pistol
at
you
point
blank
you
yourself
my
dear
boy
are
clever
enough
to
make
acquaintance
before
long
with
the
odious
and
incessant
warfare
waged
by
mediocrity
against
the
superior
man
if
you
should
drop
louis
one
day
you
will
be
accused
of
gambling
on
the
next
and
your
best
friends
will
report
that
you
have
lost
thousand
if
you
have
a
headache
you
will
be
considered
mad
if
you
are
a
little
hasty
no
one
can
live
with
you
if
to
make
a
stand
against
this
armament
of
pigmies
you
collect
your
best
powers
your
best
friends
will
cry
out
that
you
want
to
have
everything
that
you
aim
at
domineering
at
tyranny
in
short
your
good
points
will
become
your
faults
your
faults
will
be
vices
and
your
virtues
crime
if
you
save
a
man
you
will
be
said
to
have
killed
him
if
he
reappears
on
the
scene
it
will
be
positive
that
you
have
secured
the
present
at
the
cost
of
the
future
if
he
is
not
dead
he
will
die
stumble
and
you
fall
invent
anything
of
any
kind
and
claim
your
rights
you
will
be
crotchety
cunning
to
rising
younger
men
so
you
see
my
dear
fellow
if
i
do
not
believe
in
god
i
believe
still
less
in
man
but
do
not
you
know
in
me
another
desplein
altogether
different
from
the
desplein
whom
every
one
abuses
however
we
will
not
stir
that
well
i
was
living
in
that
house
i
was
working
hard
to
pass
my
first
examination
and
i
had
no
money
at
all
you
know
i
had
come
to
one
of
those
moments
of
extremity
when
a
man
says
will
enlist
i
had
one
hope
i
expected
from
my
home
a
box
full
of
linen
a
present
from
one
of
those
old
aunts
who
knowing
nothing
of
paris
think
of
your
shirts
while
they
imagine
that
their
nephew
with
thirty
francs
a
month
is
eating
ortolans
the
box
arrived
while
i
was
at
the
schools
it
had
cost
forty
francs
for
carriage
the
porter
a
german
shoemaker
living
in
a
loft
had
paid
the
money
and
kept
the
box
i
walked
up
and
down
the
rue
des
and
the
rue
de
de
medecine
without
hitting
on
any
scheme
which
would
release
my
trunk
without
the
payment
of
the
forty
francs
which
of
course
i
could
pay
as
soon
as
i
should
have
sold
the
linen
my
stupidity
proved
to
me
that
surgery
was
my
only
vocation
my
good
fellow
refined
souls
whose
powers
move
in
a
lofty
atmosphere
have
none
of
that
spirit
of
intrigue
that
is
fertile
in
resource
and
device
their
good
genius
is
chance
they
do
not
invent
things
come
to
them
at
night
i
went
home
at
the
very
moment
when
my
fellow
lodger
also
came
in
a
named
bourgeat
a
native
of
we
knew
each
other
as
two
lodgers
do
who
have
rooms
off
the
same
landing
and
who
hear
each
other
sleeping
coughing
dressing
and
so
at
last
become
used
to
one
another
my
neighbor
informed
me
that
the
landlord
to
whom
i
owed
three
quarters
rent
had
turned
me
out
i
must
clear
out
next
morning
he
himself
was
also
turned
out
on
account
of
his
occupation
i
spent
the
most
miserable
night
of
my
life
where
was
i
to
get
a
messenger
who
could
carry
my
few
chattels
and
my
books
how
could
i
pay
him
and
the
porter
where
was
i
to
go
i
repeated
these
unanswerable
questions
again
and
again
in
tears
as
madmen
repeat
their
tunes
i
fell
asleep
poverty
has
for
its
friends
heavenly
slumbers
full
of
beautiful
dreams
next
morning
just
as
i
was
swallowing
my
little
bowl
of
bread
soaked
in
milk
bourgeat
came
in
and
said
to
me
in
his
vile
auvergne
accent
i
am
a
poor
man
a
foundling
from
the
hospital
at
without
either
father
or
mother
and
not
rich
enough
to
marry
you
are
not
fertile
in
relations
either
nor
well
supplied
with
the
ready
listen
i
have
a
downstairs
which
i
have
hired
for
two
sous
an
hour
it
will
hold
all
our
goods
if
you
like
we
will
try
to
find
lodgings
together
since
we
are
both
turned
out
of
this
it
is
not
the
earthly
paradise
when
all
is
said
and
done
know
that
my
good
bourgeat
said
i
i
am
in
a
great
fix
i
have
a
trunk
downstairs
with
a
hundred
francs
worth
of
linen
in
it
out
of
which
i
could
pay
the
landlord
and
all
i
owe
to
the
porter
and
i
have
not
a
hundred
sous
i
have
a
few
dibs
replied
bourgeat
joyfully
and
he
pulled
out
a
greasy
old
leather
purse
your
linen
bourgeat
paid
up
my
arrears
and
his
own
and
settled
with
the
porter
then
he
put
our
furniture
and
my
box
of
linen
in
his
cart
and
pulled
it
along
the
street
stopping
in
front
of
every
house
where
there
was
a
notice
board
i
went
up
to
see
whether
the
rooms
to
let
would
suit
us
at
midday
we
were
still
wandering
about
the
neighborhood
without
having
found
anything
the
price
was
the
great
difficulty
bourgeat
proposed
that
we
should
eat
at
a
wine
shop
leaving
the
cart
at
the
door
towards
evening
i
discovered
in
the
cour
de
rohan
passage
du
commerce
at
the
very
top
of
a
house
next
the
roof
two
rooms
with
a
staircase
between
them
each
of
us
was
to
pay
sixty
francs
a
year
so
there
we
were
housed
my
humble
friend
and
i
we
dined
together
bourgeat
who
earned
about
fifty
sous
a
day
had
saved
a
hundred
crowns
or
so
he
would
soon
be
able
to
gratify
his
ambition
by
buying
a
barrel
and
a
horse
on
learning
of
my
situation
for
he
extracted
my
secrets
with
a
quiet
craftiness
and
good
nature
of
which
the
remembrance
touches
my
heart
to
this
day
he
gave
up
for
a
time
the
ambition
of
his
whole
life
for
years
he
had
been
carrying
water
in
the
street
and
he
now
devoted
his
hundred
crowns
to
my
future
prospects
desplein
at
these
words
clutched
bianchon
arm
tightly
he
gave
me
the
money
for
my
examination
fees
that
man
my
friend
understood
that
i
had
a
mission
that
the
needs
of
my
intellect
were
greater
than
his
he
looked
after
me
he
called
me
his
boy
he
lent
me
money
to
buy
books
he
would
come
in
softly
sometimes
to
watch
me
at
work
and
took
a
care
in
seeing
that
i
had
wholesome
and
abundant
food
instead
of
the
bad
and
insufficient
nourishment
i
had
been
condemned
to
bourgeat
a
man
of
about
forty
had
a
homely
mediaeval
type
of
face
a
prominent
forehead
a
head
that
a
painter
might
have
chosen
as
a
model
for
that
of
lycurgus
the
poor
man
heart
was
big
with
affections
seeking
an
object
he
had
never
been
loved
but
by
a
poodle
that
had
died
some
time
since
of
which
he
would
talk
to
me
asking
whether
i
thought
the
church
would
allow
masses
to
be
said
for
the
repose
of
its
soul
his
dog
said
he
had
been
a
good
christian
who
for
twelve
years
had
accompanied
him
to
church
never
barking
listening
to
the
organ
without
opening
his
mouth
and
crouching
beside
him
in
a
way
that
made
it
seem
as
though
he
were
praying
too
this
man
centered
all
his
affections
in
me
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
forlorn
and
suffering
creature
and
he
became
to
me
the
most
thoughtful
mother
the
most
considerate
benefactor
the
ideal
of
the
virtue
which
rejoices
in
its
own
work
when
i
met
him
in
the
street
he
would
throw
me
a
glance
of
intelligence
full
of
unutterable
dignity
he
would
affect
to
walk
as
though
he
carried
no
weight
and
seemed
happy
in
seeing
me
in
good
health
and
well
dressed
it
was
in
fact
the
devoted
affection
of
the
lower
classes
the
love
of
a
girl
of
the
people
transferred
to
a
loftier
level
bourgeat
did
all
my
errands
woke
me
at
night
at
any
fixed
hour
trimmed
my
lamp
cleaned
our
landing
as
good
as
a
servant
as
he
was
as
a
father
and
as
clean
as
an
english
girl
he
did
all
the
housework
like
philopoemen
he
sawed
our
wood
and
gave
to
all
he
did
the
grace
of
simplicity
while
preserving
his
dignity
for
he
seemed
to
understand
that
the
end
ennobles
every
act
when
i
left
this
good
fellow
to
be
house
surgeon
at
the
i
felt
an
indescribable
dull
pain
knowing
that
he
could
no
longer
live
with
me
but
he
comforted
himself
with
the
prospect
of
saving
up
money
enough
for
me
to
take
my
degree
and
he
made
me
promise
to
go
to
see
him
whenever
i
had
a
day
out
bourgeat
was
proud
of
me
he
loved
me
for
my
own
sake
and
for
his
own
if
you
look
up
my
thesis
you
will
see
that
i
dedicated
it
to
him
during
the
last
year
of
my
residence
as
house
surgeon
i
earned
enough
to
repay
all
i
owed
to
this
worthy
auvergnat
by
buying
him
a
barrel
and
a
horse
he
was
furious
with
rage
at
learning
that
i
had
been
depriving
myself
of
spending
my
money
and
yet
he
was
delighted
to
see
his
wishes
fulfilled
he
laughed
and
scolded
he
looked
at
his
barrel
at
his
horse
and
wiped
away
a
tear
as
he
said
is
too
bad
what
a
splendid
barrel
you
really
ought
not
why
that
horse
is
as
strong
as
an
auvergnat
i
never
saw
a
more
touching
scene
bourgeat
insisted
on
buying
for
me
the
case
of
instruments
mounted
in
silver
which
you
have
seen
in
my
room
and
which
is
to
me
the
most
precious
thing
there
though
enchanted
with
my
first
success
never
did
the
least
sign
the
least
word
escape
him
which
might
imply
man
owes
all
to
me
and
yet
but
for
him
i
should
have
died
of
want
he
had
eaten
bread
rubbed
with
garlic
that
i
might
have
coffee
to
enable
me
to
sit
up
at
night
he
fell
as
you
may
suppose
i
passed
my
nights
by
his
bedside
and
the
first
time
i
pulled
him
through
but
two
years
after
he
had
a
relapse
in
spite
of
the
utmost
care
in
spite
of
the
greatest
exertions
of
science
he
succumbed
no
king
was
ever
nursed
as
he
was
yes
bianchon
to
snatch
that
man
from
death
i
tried
things
i
wanted
him
to
live
long
enough
to
show
him
his
work
accomplished
to
realize
all
his
hopes
to
give
expression
to
the
only
need
for
gratitude
that
ever
filled
my
heart
to
quench
a
fire
that
burns
in
me
to
this
day
bourgeat
my
second
father
died
in
my
arms
desplein
went
on
after
a
pause
visibly
moved
he
left
me
everything
he
possessed
by
a
will
he
had
had
made
by
a
public
scrivener
dating
from
the
year
when
we
had
gone
to
live
in
the
cour
de
rohan
this
man
faith
was
perfect
he
loved
the
holy
virgin
as
he
might
have
loved
his
wife
he
was
an
ardent
catholic
but
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
my
want
of
religion
when
he
was
dying
he
entreated
me
to
spare
no
expense
that
he
might
have
every
possible
benefit
of
clergy
i
had
a
mass
said
for
him
every
day
often
in
the
night
he
would
tell
me
of
his
fears
as
to
his
future
fate
he
feared
his
life
had
not
been
saintly
enough
poor
man
he
was
at
work
from
morning
till
night
for
whom
then
is
paradise
if
there
be
a
paradise
he
received
the
last
sacrament
like
the
saint
that
he
was
and
his
death
was
worthy
of
his
life
i
alone
followed
him
to
the
grave
when
i
had
laid
my
only
benefactor
to
rest
i
looked
about
to
see
how
i
could
pay
my
debt
to
him
i
found
he
had
neither
family
nor
friends
neither
wife
nor
child
but
he
believed
he
had
a
religious
conviction
had
i
any
right
to
dispute
it
he
had
spoken
to
me
timidly
of
masses
said
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
he
would
not
impress
it
on
me
as
a
duty
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
form
of
repayment
for
his
services
as
soon
as
i
had
money
enough
i
paid
to
the
requisite
sum
for
four
masses
every
year
as
the
only
thing
i
can
do
for
bourgeat
is
thus
to
satisfy
his
pious
wishes
on
the
days
when
that
mass
is
said
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
of
the
year
i
go
for
his
sake
and
say
the
required
prayers
and
i
say
with
the
good
faith
of
a
sceptic
god
if
there
is
a
sphere
which
thou
hast
appointed
after
death
for
those
who
have
been
perfect
remember
good
bourgeat
and
if
he
should
have
anything
to
suffer
let
me
suffer
it
for
him
that
he
may
enter
all
the
sooner
into
what
is
called
paradise
that
my
dear
fellow
is
as
much
as
a
man
who
holds
my
opinions
can
allow
himself
but
god
must
be
a
good
fellow
he
can
not
owe
me
any
grudge
i
swear
to
you
i
would
give
my
whole
fortune
if
faith
such
as
bourgeat
could
enter
my
brain
bianchon

was

desplein

illness

not
affirm
to
this

that
the
great
surgeon
died

atheist

auvergnat
came
