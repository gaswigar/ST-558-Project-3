that
first
glorious
rush
round
the
garden
cyril
had
nipped
his
finger
in
the
door
of
a
hutch
anthea
suddenly
screamed
it
alive
the
baby
did
not
know
them
martha
emptied
a
of
cold
water
over
him
the
rain
fell
in
slow
drops
on
to
anthea
face
he
staggered
and
had
to
sit
down
again
in
a
hurry
beale
snatched
the
coin
bit
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
they
had
run
into
martha
and
the
baby
he
said
now
then
to
the
policeman
and
peasemarsh
the
lucky
children
hurriedly
started
for
the
gravel
pit
poof
poof
poofy
he
said
and
made
a
grab
at
time
ran
the
twinkling
legs
of
the
lamb
brothers
and
sisters
the
next
minute
the
two
were
fighting
he
snatched
the
baby
from
anthea
he
consented
to
let
the
two
gypsy
women
feed
him
the
blew
himself
out
they
flew
over
rochester
the
farmer
sat
down
on
the
grass
suddenly
and
heavily
everyone
now
turned
out
his
pockets
these
were
the
necessaries
of
life
the
children
were
fast
asleep
the
keeper
spoke
words
through
the
keyhole
there
the
castle
stood
black
and
stately
robert
was
dragged
forthwith
by
the
reluctant
ear
he
wiped
away
a
manly
tear
oh
do
do
do
said
robert
the
man
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
anthea
tilted
the
pot
over
the
nearest
leadhole
he
pulled
robert
hair
the
sammyadd
done
us
again
said
cyril
he
lifted
up
the
baker
boy
and
set
him
on
top
of
the
haystack
it
was
a
strange
sensation
being
wheeled
in
a
by
a
giant
when
the
girl
came
out
she
was
pale
and
trembling
when
your
time
up
come
to
me
he
opened
the
case
and
used
the
whole
thing
as
a
garden
spade
she
did
it
gently
by
tickling
his
nose
with
a
twig
of
honeysuckle
there
sure
enough
stood
a
bicycle
the
punctured
state
of
it
was
soon
evident
the
lamb
struggled
she
broke
open
the
missionary
box
with
the
poker
ye
seek
a
he
said
bright
knives
were
being
brandished
all
about
them
she
was
clasped
in
eight
loving
arms
we
found
a
fairy
said
jane
obediently
it
burrowed
and
disappeared
scratching
fiercely
to
the
last
chapter
i
beautiful
as
the
day
the
house
was
three
miles
from
the
station
but
before
the
dusty
hired
hack
had
rattled
along
for
five
minutes
the
children
began
to
put
their
heads
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
say
are
we
nearly
there
and
every
time
they
passed
a
house
which
was
not
very
often
they
all
said
oh
this
it
but
it
never
was
till
they
reached
the
very
top
of
the
hill
just
past
the
and
before
you
come
to
the
and
then
there
was
a
white
house
with
a
green
garden
and
an
orchard
beyond
and
mother
said
here
we
are
how
white
the
house
is
said
robert
and
look
at
the
roses
said
anthea
and
the
plums
said
jane
it
is
rather
decent
cyril
admitted
the
baby
said
wanty
go
walky
and
the
hack
stopped
with
a
last
rattle
and
jolt
everyone
got
its
legs
kicked
or
its
feet
trodden
on
in
the
scramble
to
get
out
of
the
carriage
that
very
minute
but
no
one
seemed
to
mind
mother
curiously
enough
was
in
no
hurry
to
get
out
and
even
when
she
had
come
down
slowly
and
by
the
step
and
with
no
jump
at
all
she
seemed
to
wish
to
see
the
boxes
carried
in
and
even
to
pay
the
driver
instead
of
joining
in
that
first
glorious
rush
round
the
garden
and
orchard
and
the
thorny
thistly
briery
brambly
wilderness
beyond
the
broken
gate
and
the
dry
fountain
at
the
side
of
the
house
but
the
children
were
wiser
for
once
it
was
not
really
a
pretty
house
at
all
it
was
quite
ordinary
and
mother
thought
it
was
rather
inconvenient
and
was
quite
annoyed
at
there
being
no
shelves
to
speak
of
and
hardly
a
cupboard
in
the
place
father
used
to
say
that
the
on
the
roof
and
coping
was
like
an
architect
nightmare
but
the
house
was
deep
in
the
country
with
no
other
house
in
sight
and
the
children
had
been
in
london
for
two
years
without
so
much
as
once
going
to
the
seaside
even
for
a
day
by
an
excursion
train
and
so
the
white
house
seemed
to
them
a
sort
of
fairy
palace
set
down
in
an
earthly
paradise
for
london
is
like
prison
for
children
especially
if
their
relations
are
not
rich
illustration
that
first
glorious
rush
round
the
garden
of
course
there
are
the
shops
and
theatres
and
entertainments
and
things
but
if
your
people
are
rather
poor
you
do
get
taken
to
the
theatres
and
you
ca
buy
things
out
of
the
shops
and
london
has
none
of
those
nice
things
that
children
may
play
with
without
hurting
the
things
or
themselves
such
as
trees
and
sand
and
woods
and
waters
and
nearly
everything
in
london
is
the
wrong
sort
of
shape
all
straight
lines
and
flat
streets
instead
of
being
all
sorts
of
odd
shapes
like
things
are
in
the
country
trees
are
all
different
as
you
know
and
i
am
sure
some
tiresome
person
must
have
told
you
that
there
are
no
two
blades
of
grass
exactly
alike
but
in
streets
where
the
blades
of
grass
do
grow
everything
is
like
everything
else
this
is
why
many
children
who
live
in
the
towns
are
so
extremely
naughty
they
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
them
and
no
more
do
their
fathers
and
mothers
aunts
uncles
cousins
tutors
governesses
and
nurses
but
i
know
and
so
do
you
now
children
in
the
country
are
naughty
sometimes
too
but
that
is
for
quite
different
reasons
the
children
had
explored
the
gardens
and
the
outhouses
thoroughly
before
they
were
caught
and
cleaned
for
tea
and
they
saw
quite
well
that
they
were
certain
to
be
happy
at
the
white
house
they
thought
so
from
the
first
moment
but
when
they
found
the
back
of
the
house
covered
with
jasmine
all
in
white
flower
and
smelling
like
a
bottle
of
the
most
expensive
perfume
that
is
ever
given
for
a
birthday
present
and
when
they
had
seen
the
lawn
all
green
and
smooth
and
quite
different
from
the
brown
grass
in
the
gardens
at
camden
town
and
when
they
found
the
stable
with
a
loft
over
it
and
some
old
hay
still
left
they
were
almost
certain
and
when
robert
had
found
the
broken
swing
and
tumbled
out
of
it
and
got
a
bump
on
his
head
the
size
of
an
egg
and
cyril
had
nipped
his
finger
in
the
door
of
a
hutch
that
seemed
made
to
keep
rabbits
in
if
you
ever
had
any
they
had
no
longer
any
doubts
whatever
illustration
cyril
had
nipped
his
finger
in
the
door
of
a
hutch
the
best
part
of
it
all
was
that
there
were
no
rules
about
not
going
to
places
and
not
doing
things
in
london
almost
everything
is
labelled
you
must
touch
and
though
the
label
is
invisible
it
just
as
bad
because
you
know
it
there
or
if
you
do
you
very
soon
get
told
the
white
house
was
on
the
edge
of
a
hill
with
a
wood
behind
it
and
the
on
one
side
and
the
on
the
other
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
a
level
plain
with
white
buildings
where
people
burnt
lime
and
a
big
red
brewery
and
other
houses
and
when
the
big
chimneys
were
smoking
and
the
sun
was
setting
the
valley
looked
as
if
it
was
filled
with
golden
mist
and
the
limekilns
and
houses
glimmered
and
glittered
till
they
were
like
an
enchanted
city
out
of
the
now
that
i
have
begun
to
tell
you
about
the
place
i
feel
that
i
could
go
on
and
make
this
into
a
most
interesting
story
about
all
the
ordinary
things
that
the
children
did
just
the
kind
of
things
you
do
yourself
you
know
and
you
would
believe
every
word
of
it
and
when
i
told
about
the
children
being
tiresome
as
you
are
sometimes
your
aunts
would
perhaps
write
in
the
margin
of
the
story
with
a
pencil
how
true
or
how
like
life
and
you
would
see
it
and
would
very
likely
be
annoyed
so
i
will
only
tell
you
the
really
astonishing
things
that
happened
and
you
may
leave
the
book
about
quite
safely
for
no
aunts
and
uncles
either
are
likely
to
write
how
true
on
the
edge
of
the
story
people
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
really
wonderful
things
unless
they
have
what
they
call
proof
but
children
will
believe
almost
anything
and
know
this
that
is
why
they
tell
you
that
the
earth
is
round
like
an
orange
when
you
can
see
perfectly
well
that
it
is
flat
and
lumpy
and
why
they
say
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
when
you
can
see
for
yourself
any
day
that
the
sun
gets
up
in
the
morning
and
goes
to
bed
at
night
like
a
good
sun
as
it
is
and
the
earth
knows
its
place
and
lies
as
still
as
a
mouse
yet
i
daresay
you
believe
all
that
about
the
earth
and
the
sun
and
if
so
you
will
find
it
quite
easy
to
believe
that
before
anthea
and
cyril
and
the
others
had
been
a
week
in
the
country
they
had
found
a
fairy
at
least
they
called
it
that
because
that
was
what
it
called
itself
and
of
course
it
knew
best
but
it
was
not
at
all
like
any
fairy
you
ever
saw
or
heard
of
or
read
about
it
was
at
the
father
had
to
go
away
suddenly
on
business
and
mother
had
gone
away
to
stay
with
granny
who
was
not
very
well
they
both
went
in
a
great
hurry
and
when
they
were
gone
the
house
seemed
dreadfully
quiet
and
empty
and
the
children
wandered
from
one
room
to
another
and
looked
at
the
bits
of
paper
and
string
on
the
floors
left
over
from
the
packing
and
not
yet
cleared
up
and
wished
they
had
something
to
do
it
was
cyril
who
said
i
say
let
take
our
spades
and
dig
in
the
we
can
pretend
it
seaside
father
says
it
was
once
anthea
said
he
says
there
are
shells
there
thousands
of
years
old
so
they
went
of
course
they
had
been
to
the
edge
of
the
and
looked
over
but
they
had
not
gone
down
into
it
for
fear
father
should
say
they
must
play
there
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
the
is
not
really
dangerous
if
you
do
try
to
climb
down
the
edges
but
go
the
slow
safe
way
round
by
the
road
as
if
you
were
a
cart
each
of
the
children
carried
its
own
spade
and
took
it
in
turns
to
carry
the
lamb
he
was
the
baby
and
they
called
him
that
because
baa
was
the
first
thing
he
ever
said
they
called
anthea
panther
which
seems
silly
when
you
read
it
but
when
you
say
it
it
sounds
a
little
like
her
name
the
is
very
large
and
wide
with
grass
growing
round
the
edges
at
the
top
and
dry
stringy
wildflowers
purple
and
yellow
it
is
like
a
giant
washbowl
and
there
are
mounds
of
gravel
and
holes
in
the
sides
of
the
bowl
where
gravel
has
been
taken
out
and
high
up
in
the
steep
sides
there
are
the
little
holes
that
are
the
little
front
doors
of
the
little
little
houses
the
children
built
a
castle
of
course
but
is
rather
poor
fun
when
you
have
no
hope
of
the
swishing
tide
ever
coming
in
to
fill
up
the
moat
and
wash
away
the
drawbridge
and
at
the
happy
last
to
wet
everybody
up
to
the
waist
at
least
cyril
wanted
to
dig
out
a
cave
to
play
smugglers
in
but
the
others
thought
it
might
bury
them
alive
so
it
ended
in
all
spades
going
to
work
to
dig
a
hole
through
the
castle
to
australia
these
children
you
see
believed
that
the
world
was
round
and
that
on
the
other
side
the
little
australian
boys
and
girls
were
really
walking
wrong
way
up
like
flies
on
the
ceiling
with
their
heads
hanging
down
into
the
air
the
children
dug
and
they
dug
and
they
dug
and
their
hands
got
sandy
and
hot
and
red
and
their
faces
got
damp
and
shiny
the
lamb
had
tried
to
eat
the
sand
and
had
cried
so
hard
when
he
found
that
it
was
not
as
he
had
supposed
brown
sugar
that
he
was
now
tired
out
and
was
lying
asleep
in
a
warm
fat
bunch
in
the
middle
of
the
castle
this
left
his
brothers
and
sisters
free
to
work
really
hard
and
the
hole
that
was
to
come
out
in
australia
soon
grew
so
deep
that
jane
who
was
called
pussy
for
short
begged
the
others
to
stop
suppose
the
bottom
of
the
hole
gave
way
suddenly
said
she
and
you
tumbled
out
among
the
little
australians
all
the
sand
would
get
in
their
eyes
yes
said
robert
and
they
would
hate
us
and
throw
stones
at
us
and
not
let
us
see
the
kangaroos
or
opossums
or
bluegums
or
emu
brand
birds
or
anything
cyril
and
anthea
knew
that
australia
was
not
quite
so
near
as
all
that
but
they
agreed
to
stop
using
the
spades
and
to
go
on
with
their
hands
this
was
quite
easy
because
the
sand
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
was
very
soft
and
fine
and
dry
like
and
there
were
little
shells
in
it
fancy
it
having
been
wet
sea
here
once
all
sloppy
and
shiny
said
jane
with
fishes
and
and
coral
and
mermaids
and
masts
of
ships
and
wrecked
spanish
treasure
i
wish
we
could
find
a
gold
doubloon
or
something
cyril
said
how
did
the
sea
get
carried
away
robert
asked
not
in
a
pail
silly
said
his
brother
father
says
the
earth
got
too
hot
underneath
as
you
do
in
bed
sometimes
so
it
just
hunched
up
its
shoulders
and
the
sea
had
to
slip
off
like
the
blankets
do
us
and
the
shoulder
was
left
sticking
out
and
turned
into
dry
land
let
go
and
look
for
shells
i
think
that
little
cave
looks
likely
and
i
see
something
sticking
out
there
like
a
bit
of
wrecked
ship
anchor
and
it
beastly
hot
in
the
australian
hole
the
others
agreed
but
anthea
went
on
digging
she
always
liked
to
finish
a
thing
when
she
had
once
begun
it
she
felt
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
leave
that
hole
without
getting
through
to
australia
the
cave
was
disappointing
because
there
were
no
shells
and
the
wrecked
ship
anchor
turned
out
to
be
only
the
broken
end
of
a
handle
and
the
cave
party
were
just
making
up
their
minds
that
sand
makes
you
thirstier
when
it
is
not
by
the
seaside
and
someone
had
suggested
that
they
all
go
home
for
lemonade
when
anthea
suddenly
screamed
cyril
come
here
oh
come
quick
it
alive
it
get
away
quick
they
all
hurried
back
it
a
rat
i
should
wonder
said
robert
father
says
they
infest
old
places
and
this
must
be
pretty
old
if
the
sea
was
here
thousands
of
years
ago
perhaps
it
is
a
snake
said
jane
shuddering
let
look
said
cyril
jumping
into
the
hole
i
not
afraid
of
snakes
i
like
them
if
it
is
a
snake
i
tame
it
and
it
will
follow
me
everywhere
and
i
let
it
sleep
round
my
neck
at
night
no
you
wo
said
robert
firmly
he
shared
cyril
bedroom
but
you
may
if
it
a
rat
illustration
anthea
suddenly
screamed
it
alive
oh
do
be
silly
said
anthea
it
not
a
rat
it
bigger
and
it
not
a
snake
it
got
feet
i
saw
them
and
fur
no
not
the
spade
you
hurt
it
dig
with
your
hands
and
let
hurt
instead
that
so
likely
is
it
said
cyril
seizing
a
spade
oh
do
said
anthea
squirrel
i
it
sounds
silly
but
it
said
something
it
really
and
truly
did
what
it
said
let
me
alone
but
cyril
merely
observed
that
his
sister
must
have
gone
off
her
head
and
he
and
robert
dug
with
spades
while
anthea
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
hole
jumping
up
and
down
with
hotness
and
anxiety
they
dug
carefully
and
presently
everyone
could
see
that
there
really
was
something
moving
in
the
bottom
of
the
australian
hole
then
anthea
cried
out
not
afraid
let
me
dig
and
fell
on
her
knees
and
began
to
scratch
like
a
dog
does
when
he
has
suddenly
remembered
where
it
was
that
he
buried
his
bone
oh
i
felt
fur
she
cried
half
laughing
and
half
crying
i
did
indeed
i
did
when
suddenly
a
dry
husky
voice
in
the
sand
made
them
all
jump
back
and
their
hearts
jumped
nearly
as
fast
as
they
did
let
me
alone
it
said
and
now
everyone
heard
the
voice
and
looked
at
the
others
to
see
if
they
had
heard
it
too
but
we
want
to
see
you
said
robert
bravely
i
wish
you
come
out
said
anthea
also
taking
courage
oh
well
if
that
your
wish
the
voice
said
and
the
sand
stirred
and
spun
and
scattered
and
something
brown
and
furry
and
fat
came
rolling
out
into
the
hole
and
the
sand
fell
off
it
and
it
sat
there
yawning
and
rubbing
the
ends
of
its
eyes
with
its
hands
i
believe
i
must
have
dropped
asleep
it
said
stretching
itself
the
children
stood
round
the
hole
in
a
ring
looking
at
the
creature
they
had
found
it
was
worth
looking
at
its
eyes
were
on
long
horns
like
a
snail
eyes
and
it
could
move
them
in
and
out
like
telescopes
it
had
ears
like
a
bat
ears
and
its
tubby
body
was
shaped
like
a
spider
and
covered
with
thick
soft
fur
its
legs
and
arms
were
furry
too
and
it
had
hands
and
feet
like
a
monkey
what
on
earth
is
it
jane
said
shall
we
take
it
home
the
thing
turned
its
long
eyes
to
look
at
her
and
said
does
she
always
talk
nonsense
or
is
it
only
the
rubbish
on
her
head
that
makes
her
silly
it
looked
scornfully
at
jane
hat
as
it
spoke
she
does
mean
to
be
silly
anthea
said
gently
we
none
of
us
do
whatever
you
may
think
do
be
frightened
we
do
want
to
hurt
you
you
know
hurt
it
said
frightened
upon
my
word
why
you
talk
as
if
i
were
nobody
in
particular
all
its
fur
stood
out
like
a
cat
when
it
is
going
to
fight
well
said
anthea
still
kindly
perhaps
if
we
knew
who
you
are
in
particular
we
could
think
of
something
to
say
that
would
make
you
angry
everything
we
said
so
far
seems
to
have
done
so
who
are
you
and
do
get
angry
because
really
we
do
know
you
do
know
it
said
well
i
knew
the
world
had
changed
but
well
really
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
seriously
you
know
a
psammead
when
you
see
one
a
sammyadd
that
greek
to
me
so
it
is
to
everyone
said
the
creature
sharply
well
in
plain
english
then
a
do
you
know
a
when
you
see
one
it
looked
so
grieved
and
hurt
that
jane
hastened
to
say
of
course
i
see
you
are
it
quite
plain
now
one
comes
to
look
at
you
you
came
to
look
at
me
several
sentences
ago
it
said
crossly
beginning
to
curl
up
again
in
the
sand
oh
do
go
away
again
do
talk
some
more
robert
cried
i
know
you
were
a
but
i
knew
directly
i
saw
you
that
you
were
much
the
wonderfullest
thing
i
ever
seen
the
seemed
a
shade
less
disagreeable
after
this
it
is
talking
i
mind
it
said
as
long
as
you
reasonably
civil
but
i
not
going
to
make
polite
conversation
for
you
if
you
talk
nicely
to
me
perhaps
i
answer
you
and
perhaps
i
wo
now
say
something
of
course
no
one
could
think
of
anything
to
say
but
at
last
robert
thought
of
how
long
have
you
lived
here
and
he
said
it
at
once
oh
ages
several
thousand
years
replied
the
psammead
tell
us
about
it
do
it
all
in
books
are
jane
said
oh
tell
us
everything
you
can
about
yourself
we
do
know
anything
about
you
and
you
so
nice
the
smoothed
his
long
whiskers
and
smiled
between
them
do
please
tell
said
the
children
all
together
it
is
wonderful
how
quickly
you
get
used
to
things
even
the
most
astonishing
five
minutes
before
the
children
had
had
no
more
idea
than
you
had
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
in
the
world
and
now
they
were
talking
to
it
as
though
they
had
known
it
all
their
lives
it
drew
its
eyes
in
and
said
how
very
sunny
it
is
quite
like
old
times
where
do
you
get
your
megatheriums
from
now
what
said
the
children
all
at
once
it
is
very
difficult
always
to
remember
that
what
is
not
polite
especially
in
moments
of
surprise
or
agitation
are
pterodactyls
plentiful
now
the
went
on
the
children
were
unable
to
reply
what
do
you
have
for
breakfast
the
fairy
said
impatiently
and
who
gives
it
to
you
eggs
and
bacon
and
bread
and
milk
and
porridge
and
things
mother
gives
it
to
us
what
are
and
and
does
anyone
have
them
for
breakfast
why
almost
everyone
had
pterodactyl
for
breakfast
in
my
time
pterodactyls
were
something
like
crocodiles
and
something
like
birds
i
believe
they
were
very
good
grilled
you
see
it
was
like
this
of
course
there
were
heaps
of
then
and
in
the
morning
early
you
went
out
and
hunted
for
them
and
when
you
found
one
it
gave
you
your
wish
people
used
to
send
their
little
boys
down
to
the
seashore
in
the
morning
before
breakfast
to
get
the
day
wishes
and
very
often
the
eldest
boy
in
the
family
would
be
told
to
wish
for
a
megatherium
ready
jointed
for
cooking
it
was
as
big
as
an
elephant
you
see
so
there
was
a
good
deal
of
meat
on
it
and
if
they
wanted
fish
the
ichthyosaurus
was
asked
for
he
was
twenty
to
forty
feet
long
so
there
was
plenty
of
him
and
for
poultry
there
was
the
plesiosaurus
there
were
nice
pickings
on
that
too
then
the
other
children
could
wish
for
other
things
but
when
people
had
it
was
nearly
always
megatheriums
and
ichthyosaurus
because
his
fins
were
a
great
delicacy
and
his
tail
made
soup
there
must
have
been
heaps
and
heaps
of
cold
meat
left
over
said
anthea
who
meant
to
be
a
good
housekeeper
some
day
oh
no
said
the
psammead
that
would
never
have
done
why
of
course
at
sunset
what
was
left
over
turned
into
stone
you
find
the
stone
bones
of
the
megatherium
and
things
all
over
the
place
even
now
they
tell
me
who
tell
you
asked
cyril
but
the
frowned
and
began
to
dig
very
fast
with
its
furry
hands
oh
do
go
they
all
cried
tell
us
more
about
when
it
was
megatheriums
for
breakfast
was
the
world
like
this
then
it
stopped
digging
not
a
bit
it
said
it
was
nearly
all
sand
where
i
lived
and
coal
grew
on
trees
and
the
periwinkles
were
as
big
as
you
find
them
now
they
turned
into
stone
we
used
to
live
on
the
seashore
and
the
children
used
to
come
with
their
little
and
and
make
castles
for
us
to
live
in
that
thousands
of
years
ago
but
i
hear
that
children
still
build
castles
on
the
sand
it
difficult
to
break
yourself
of
a
habit
but
why
did
you
stop
living
in
the
castles
asked
robert
it
a
sad
story
said
the
psammead
gloomily
it
was
because
they
build
moats
to
the
castles
and
the
nasty
wet
bubbling
sea
used
to
come
in
and
of
course
as
soon
as
a
got
wet
it
caught
cold
and
generally
died
and
so
there
got
to
be
fewer
and
fewer
and
whenever
you
found
a
fairy
and
had
a
wish
you
used
to
wish
for
a
megatherium
and
eat
twice
as
much
as
you
wanted
because
it
might
be
weeks
before
you
got
another
wish
and
did
get
wet
robert
inquired
the
shuddered
only
once
it
said
the
end
of
the
twelfth
hair
of
my
top
left
whisker
i
feel
the
place
still
in
damp
weather
it
was
only
once
but
it
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
went
away
as
soon
as
the
sun
had
dried
my
poor
dear
whisker
i
scurried
away
to
the
back
of
the
beach
and
dug
myself
a
house
deep
in
warm
dry
sand
and
there
been
ever
since
and
the
sea
changed
its
lodgings
afterwards
and
now
i
not
going
to
tell
you
another
thing
just
one
more
please
said
the
children
can
you
give
wishes
now
of
course
said
it
did
i
give
you
yours
a
few
minutes
ago
you
said
wish
you
come
out
and
i
did
oh
please
may
we
have
another
yes
but
be
quick
about
it
i
tired
of
you
i
daresay
you
have
often
thought
what
you
would
do
if
you
had
three
wishes
given
you
and
have
despised
the
old
man
and
his
wife
in
the
story
and
felt
certain
that
if
you
had
the
chance
you
could
think
of
three
really
useful
wishes
without
a
moment
hesitation
these
children
had
often
talked
this
matter
over
but
now
the
chance
had
suddenly
come
to
them
they
could
not
make
up
their
minds
quick
said
the
crossly
no
one
could
think
of
anything
only
anthea
did
manage
to
remember
a
private
wish
of
her
own
and
which
they
had
never
told
the
boys
she
knew
the
boys
would
not
care
about
it
but
still
it
was
better
than
nothing
i
wish
we
were
all
as
beautiful
as
the
day
she
said
in
a
great
hurry
the
children
looked
at
each
other
but
each
could
see
that
the
others
were
not
any
than
usual
the
psammead
pushed
out
his
long
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
holding
its
breath
and
swelling
itself
out
till
it
was
twice
as
fat
and
furry
as
before
suddenly
it
let
its
breath
go
in
a
long
sigh
i
really
afraid
i
ca
manage
it
it
said
apologetically
i
must
be
out
of
practice
the
children
were
horribly
disappointed
oh
try
again
they
said
well
said
the
the
fact
is
i
was
keeping
back
a
little
strength
to
give
the
rest
of
you
your
wishes
with
if
you
be
contented
with
one
wish
a
day
among
the
lot
of
you
i
daresay
i
can
screw
myself
up
to
it
do
you
agree
to
that
yes
oh
yes
said
jane
and
anthea
the
boys
nodded
they
did
not
believe
the
could
do
it
you
can
always
make
girls
believe
things
much
easier
than
you
can
boys
it
stretched
out
its
eyes
farther
than
ever
and
swelled
and
swelled
and
swelled
i
do
hope
it
wo
hurt
itself
said
anthea
or
crack
its
skin
robert
said
anxiously
everyone
was
very
much
relieved
when
the
after
getting
so
big
that
it
almost
filled
up
the
hole
in
the
sand
suddenly
let
out
its
breath
and
went
back
to
its
proper
size
that
all
right
it
said
panting
heavily
it
come
easier
did
it
hurt
much
said
anthea
only
my
poor
whisker
thank
you
said
he
but
you
a
kind
and
thoughtful
child
good
day
it
scratched
suddenly
and
fiercely
with
its
hands
and
feet
and
disappeared
in
the
sand
then
the
children
looked
at
each
other
and
each
child
suddenly
found
itself
alone
with
three
perfect
strangers
all
radiantly
beautiful
they
stood
for
some
moments
in
silence
each
thought
that
its
brothers
and
sisters
had
wandered
off
and
that
these
strange
children
had
stolen
up
unnoticed
while
it
was
watching
the
swelling
form
of
the
anthea
spoke
first
excuse
me
she
said
very
politely
to
jane
who
now
had
enormous
blue
eyes
and
a
cloud
of
russet
hair
but
have
you
seen
two
little
boys
and
a
little
girl
anywhere
about
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
that
said
jane
and
then
cyril
cried
why
it
i
know
the
hole
in
your
pinafore
you
jane
are
you
and
you
the
panther
i
can
see
your
dirty
handkerchief
that
you
forgot
to
change
after
you
cut
your
thumb
the
wish
come
off
after
all
i
say
am
i
as
handsome
as
you
are
if
you
cyril
i
liked
you
much
better
as
you
were
before
said
anthea
decidedly
you
look
like
the
picture
of
the
young
chorister
with
your
golden
hair
you
die
young
i
should
wonder
and
if
that
robert
he
like
an
italian
his
hair
all
black
you
two
girls
are
like
christmas
cards
then
that
all
silly
christmas
cards
said
robert
angrily
and
jane
hair
is
simply
carrots
it
was
indeed
of
that
venetian
tint
so
much
admired
by
artists
well
it
no
use
finding
fault
with
each
other
said
anthea
get
the
lamb
and
lug
it
home
to
dinner
the
servants
will
admire
us
most
awfully
you
see
baby
was
just
waking
up
when
they
got
to
him
and
not
one
of
the
children
but
was
relieved
to
find
that
he
at
least
was
not
as
beautiful
as
the
day
but
just
the
same
as
usual
i
suppose
he
too
young
to
have
wishes
naturally
said
jane
we
shall
have
to
mention
him
specially
next
time
anthea
ran
forward
and
held
out
her
arms
come
then
she
said
the
baby
looked
at
her
disapprovingly
and
put
a
sandy
pink
thumb
in
his
mouth
anthea
was
his
favourite
sister
come
then
she
said
said
the
baby
come
to
own
pussy
said
jane
wants
my
panty
said
the
lamb
dismally
and
his
lip
trembled
here
come
on
veteran
said
robert
come
and
have
a
yidey
on
back
yah
narky
narky
boy
howled
the
baby
giving
way
altogether
then
the
children
knew
the
worst
baby
did
not
know
them
illustration
the
baby
did
not
know
them
they
looked
at
each
other
in
despair
and
it
was
terrible
to
each
in
this
dire
emergency
to
meet
only
the
beautiful
eyes
of
perfect
strangers
instead
of
the
merry
friendly
commonplace
twinkling
jolly
little
eyes
of
its
own
brothers
and
sisters
this
is
most
truly
awful
said
cyril
when
he
had
tried
to
lift
up
the
lamb
and
the
lamb
had
scratched
like
a
cat
and
bellowed
like
a
bull
we
got
to
with
him
i
ca
carry
him
home
screaming
like
that
fancy
having
to
make
friends
with
our
own
baby
it
too
silly
that
however
was
exactly
what
they
had
to
do
it
took
over
an
hour
and
the
task
was
not
rendered
any
easier
by
the
fact
that
the
lamb
was
by
this
time
as
hungry
as
a
lion
and
as
thirsty
as
a
desert
at
last
he
consented
to
allow
these
strangers
to
carry
him
home
by
turns
but
as
he
refused
to
hold
on
to
such
new
acquaintances
he
was
a
dead
weight
and
most
exhausting
thank
goodness
we
home
said
jane
staggering
through
the
iron
gate
to
where
martha
the
nursemaid
stood
at
the
front
door
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
looking
out
anxiously
here
do
take
baby
martha
snatched
the
baby
from
her
arms
thanks
be
safe
back
she
said
where
are
the
others
and
whoever
to
goodness
gracious
are
all
of
you
we
of
course
said
robert
and
who
us
when
you
at
home
asked
martha
scornfully
i
tell
you
it
only
we
beautiful
as
the
day
said
cyril
i
cyril
and
these
are
the
others
and
we
jolly
hungry
let
us
in
and
do
be
a
silly
idiot
martha
merely
dratted
cyril
impudence
and
tried
to
shut
the
door
in
his
face
i
know
we
different
but
i
anthea
and
we
so
tired
and
it
long
past
then
go
home
to
your
dinners
whoever
you
are
and
if
our
children
put
you
up
to
this
you
can
tell
them
from
me
they
catch
it
so
they
know
what
to
expect
with
that
she
did
bang
the
door
cyril
rang
the
bell
violently
no
answer
presently
cook
put
her
head
out
of
a
bedroom
window
and
said
if
you
do
take
yourselves
off
and
that
precious
sharp
i
go
and
fetch
the
police
and
she
slammed
down
the
window
it
no
good
said
anthea
oh
do
do
come
away
before
we
get
sent
to
prison
the
boys
said
it
was
nonsense
and
the
law
of
england
could
put
you
in
prison
for
just
being
as
beautiful
as
the
day
but
all
the
same
they
followed
the
others
out
into
the
lane
we
shall
be
our
proper
selves
after
sunset
i
suppose
said
jane
i
do
know
cyril
said
sadly
it
may
be
like
that
now
things
have
changed
a
good
deal
since
megatherium
times
oh
cried
anthea
suddenly
perhaps
we
shall
turn
into
stone
at
sunset
like
the
megatheriums
did
so
that
there
may
be
any
of
us
left
over
for
the
next
day
she
began
to
cry
so
did
jane
even
the
boys
turned
pale
no
one
had
the
heart
to
say
anything
it
was
a
horrible
afternoon
there
was
no
house
near
where
the
children
could
beg
a
crust
of
bread
or
even
a
glass
of
water
they
were
afraid
to
go
to
the
village
because
they
had
seen
martha
go
down
there
with
a
basket
and
there
was
a
local
constable
true
they
were
all
as
beautiful
as
the
day
but
that
is
a
poor
comfort
when
you
are
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
and
as
thirsty
as
a
sponge
three
times
they
tried
in
vain
to
get
the
servants
in
the
white
house
to
let
them
in
and
listen
to
their
tale
and
then
robert
went
alone
hoping
to
be
able
to
climb
in
at
one
of
the
back
windows
and
so
open
the
door
to
the
others
but
all
the
windows
were
out
of
reach
and
martha
emptied
a
of
cold
water
over
him
from
a
top
window
and
said
go
along
with
you
you
nasty
little
monkey
it
came
at
last
to
their
sitting
down
in
a
row
under
the
hedge
with
their
feet
in
a
dry
ditch
waiting
for
sunset
and
wondering
whether
when
the
sun
set
they
would
turn
into
stone
or
only
into
their
own
old
natural
selves
and
each
of
them
still
felt
lonely
and
among
strangers
and
tried
not
to
look
at
the
others
for
though
their
voices
were
their
own
their
faces
were
so
radiantly
beautiful
as
to
be
quite
irritating
to
look
at
i
do
believe
we
turn
to
stone
said
robert
breaking
a
long
miserable
silence
because
the
said
he
give
us
another
wish
and
he
could
if
we
were
stone
could
he
the
others
said
no
but
they
were
at
all
comforted
another
silence
longer
and
more
miserable
was
broken
by
suddenly
saying
i
do
want
to
frighten
you
girls
but
i
believe
beginning
with
me
already
my
foot
quite
dead
i
turning
to
stone
i
know
i
am
and
so
will
you
in
a
minute
never
mind
said
robert
kindly
perhaps
you
be
the
only
stone
one
and
the
rest
of
us
will
be
all
right
and
we
cherish
your
statue
and
hang
garlands
on
it
but
when
it
turned
out
that
cyril
foot
had
only
gone
to
sleep
through
his
sitting
too
long
with
it
under
him
and
when
it
came
to
life
in
an
agony
of
pins
and
needles
the
others
were
quite
cross
giving
us
such
a
fright
for
nothing
said
anthea
illustration
martha
emptied
a
of
cold
water
over
him
the
third
and
miserablest
silence
of
all
was
broken
by
jane
she
said
if
we
come
out
of
this
all
right
we
ask
the
sammyadd
to
make
it
so
that
the
servants
do
notice
anything
different
no
matter
what
wishes
we
have
the
others
only
grunted
they
were
too
wretched
even
to
make
good
resolutions
at
last
hunger
and
fright
and
crossness
and
tiredness
four
very
nasty
things
all
joined
together
to
bring
one
nice
thing
and
that
was
sleep
the
children
lay
asleep
in
a
row
with
their
beautiful
eyes
shut
and
their
beautiful
mouths
open
anthea
woke
first
the
sun
had
set
and
the
twilight
was
coming
on
anthea
pinched
herself
very
hard
to
make
sure
and
when
she
found
she
could
still
feel
pinching
she
decided
that
she
was
not
stone
and
then
she
pinched
the
others
they
also
were
soft
wake
up
she
said
almost
in
tears
for
joy
it
all
right
we
not
stone
and
oh
cyril
how
nice
and
ugly
you
do
look
with
your
old
freckles
and
your
brown
hair
and
your
little
eyes
and
so
do
you
all
she
added
so
that
they
might
not
feel
jealous
when
they
got
home
they
were
very
much
scolded
by
martha
who
told
them
about
the
strange
children
a
lot
i
must
say
but
that
impudent
i
know
said
robert
who
knew
by
experience
how
hopeless
it
would
be
to
try
to
explain
things
to
martha
and
where
on
earth
have
you
been
all
this
time
you
naughty
little
things
you
in
the
lane
why
did
you
come
home
hours
ago
we
could
because
of
said
anthea
who
the
children
who
were
as
beautiful
as
the
day
they
kept
us
there
till
after
sunset
we
could
come
back
till
they
gone
you
do
know
how
we
hated
them
oh
do
do
give
us
some
supper
we
are
so
hungry
hungry
i
should
think
so
said
martha
angrily
out
all
day
like
this
well
i
hope
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
not
to
go
picking
up
with
strange
children
down
here
after
measles
as
likely
as
not
now
mind
if
you
see
them
again
do
you
speak
to
them
not
one
word
nor
so
much
as
a
look
but
come
straight
away
and
tell
me
i
spoil
their
beauty
for
them
if
ever
we
see
them
again
we
tell
you
anthea
said
and
robert
fixing
his
eyes
fondly
on
the
cold
beef
that
was
being
brought
in
on
a
tray
by
cook
added
in
heartfelt
undertones
and
we
take
jolly
good
care
we
never
see
them
again
and
they
never
have
chapter
ii
golden
guineas
anthea
woke
in
the
morning
from
a
very
real
sort
of
dream
in
which
she
was
walking
in
the
zoological
gardens
on
a
pouring
wet
day
without
an
umbrella
the
animals
seemed
desperately
unhappy
because
of
the
rain
and
were
all
growling
gloomily
when
she
awoke
both
the
growling
and
the
rain
went
on
just
the
same
the
growling
was
the
heavy
regular
breathing
of
her
sister
jane
who
had
a
slight
cold
and
was
still
asleep
the
rain
fell
in
slow
drops
on
to
anthea
face
from
the
wet
corner
of
a
out
of
which
her
brother
robert
was
gently
squeezing
the
water
to
wake
her
up
as
he
now
explained
oh
drop
it
she
said
rather
crossly
so
he
did
for
he
was
not
a
brutal
brother
though
very
ingenious
in
beds
original
methods
of
awakening
sleeping
relatives
and
the
other
little
accomplishments
which
make
home
happy
illustration
the
rain
fell
in
slow
drops
on
to
anthea
face
i
had
such
a
funny
dream
anthea
began
so
did
i
said
jane
wakening
suddenly
and
without
warning
i
dreamed
we
found
a
in
the
and
it
said
it
was
a
sammyadd
and
we
might
have
a
new
wish
every
day
and
but
that
what
dreamed
said
robert
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
and
we
had
the
first
wish
directly
it
said
so
and
i
dreamed
you
girls
were
donkeys
enough
to
ask
for
us
all
to
be
beautiful
as
day
and
we
jolly
well
were
and
it
was
perfectly
beastly
but
different
people
all
dream
the
same
thing
said
anthea
sitting
up
in
bed
because
i
dreamed
all
that
as
well
as
about
the
zoo
and
the
rain
and
baby
did
know
us
in
my
dream
and
the
servants
shut
us
out
of
the
house
because
the
radiantness
of
our
beauty
was
such
a
complete
disguise
and
the
voice
of
the
eldest
brother
sounded
from
across
the
landing
come
on
robert
it
said
you
be
late
for
breakfast
again
unless
you
mean
to
shirk
your
bath
as
you
did
on
tuesday
i
say
come
here
a
second
robert
replied
i
did
shirk
it
i
had
it
after
brekker
in
father
because
ours
was
emptied
away
cyril
appeared
in
the
doorway
partially
clothed
look
here
said
anthea
we
all
had
such
an
odd
dream
we
all
dreamed
we
found
a
her
voice
died
away
before
cyril
contemptuous
glance
dream
he
said
you
little
sillies
it
i
tell
you
it
all
happened
that
why
i
so
keen
on
being
down
early
we
go
up
there
directly
after
brekker
and
have
another
wish
only
we
make
up
our
minds
solid
before
we
go
what
it
is
we
do
want
and
no
one
must
ask
for
anything
unless
the
others
agree
first
no
more
peerless
beauties
for
this
child
thank
you
not
if
i
know
it
the
other
three
dressed
with
their
mouths
open
if
all
that
dream
about
the
was
real
this
real
dressing
seemed
very
like
a
dream
the
girls
thought
jane
felt
that
cyril
was
right
but
anthea
was
not
sure
till
after
they
had
seen
martha
and
heard
her
full
and
plain
reminders
about
their
naughty
conduct
the
day
before
then
anthea
was
sure
because
said
she
servants
never
dream
anything
but
the
things
in
the
like
snakes
and
oysters
and
going
to
a
wedding
that
means
a
funeral
and
snakes
are
a
false
female
friend
and
oysters
are
babies
talking
of
babies
said
cyril
where
the
lamb
martha
going
to
take
him
to
rochester
to
see
her
cousins
mother
said
she
might
she
dressing
him
now
said
jane
in
his
very
best
coat
and
hat
please
she
seems
to
like
taking
him
too
said
robert
in
a
tone
of
wonder
servants
like
taking
babies
to
see
their
relations
cyril
said
i
noticed
it
before
especially
in
their
best
clothes
i
expect
they
pretend
they
their
own
babies
and
that
they
not
servants
at
all
but
married
to
noble
dukes
of
high
degree
and
they
say
the
babies
are
the
little
dukes
and
duchesses
jane
suggested
dreamily
taking
more
marmalade
i
expect
that
what
martha
say
to
her
cousin
she
enjoy
herself
most
frightfully
she
wo
enjoy
herself
most
frightfully
carrying
our
infant
duke
to
rochester
said
robert
not
if
she
anything
like
me
she
wo
fancy
walking
to
rochester
with
the
lamb
on
your
back
said
cyril
in
full
agreement
she
gone
by
the
carrier
cart
said
jane
let
see
them
off
then
we
shall
have
done
a
polite
and
kindly
act
and
we
shall
be
quite
sure
we
got
rid
of
them
for
the
day
so
they
did
martha
wore
her
sunday
dress
of
two
shades
of
purple
so
tight
in
the
chest
that
it
made
her
stoop
and
her
blue
hat
with
the
pink
cornflowers
and
white
ribbon
she
had
a
collar
with
a
green
bow
and
the
lamb
had
indeed
his
very
best
silk
coat
and
hat
it
was
a
smart
party
that
the
carrier
cart
picked
up
at
the
cross
roads
when
its
white
tilt
and
red
wheels
had
slowly
vanished
in
a
swirl
of
and
now
for
the
sammyadd
said
cyril
and
off
they
went
as
they
went
they
decided
on
the
wish
they
would
ask
for
although
they
were
all
in
a
great
hurry
they
did
not
try
to
climb
down
the
sides
of
the
but
went
round
by
the
safe
lower
road
as
if
they
had
been
carts
they
had
made
a
ring
of
stones
round
the
place
where
the
had
disappeared
so
they
easily
found
the
spot
the
sun
was
burning
and
bright
and
the
sky
was
deep
blue
without
a
cloud
the
sand
was
very
hot
to
touch
oh
suppose
it
was
only
a
dream
after
all
robert
said
as
the
boys
uncovered
their
spades
from
the
where
they
had
buried
them
and
began
to
dig
suppose
you
were
a
sensible
chap
said
cyril
one
quite
as
likely
as
the
other
suppose
you
kept
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
robert
snapped
suppose
we
girls
take
a
turn
said
jane
laughing
you
boys
seem
to
be
getting
very
warm
suppose
you
do
come
putting
your
silly
oar
in
said
robert
who
was
now
warm
indeed
we
wo
said
anthea
quickly
robert
dear
do
be
so
grumpy
we
wo
say
a
word
you
shall
be
the
one
to
speak
to
the
fairy
and
tell
him
what
we
decided
to
wish
for
you
say
it
much
better
than
we
shall
suppose
you
drop
being
a
little
humbug
said
robert
but
not
crossly
look
out
dig
with
your
hands
now
so
they
did
and
presently
uncovered
the
brown
hairy
body
long
arms
and
legs
bat
ears
and
snail
eyes
of
the
himself
everyone
drew
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
for
now
of
course
it
could
have
been
a
dream
the
psammead
sat
up
and
shook
the
sand
out
of
its
fur
how
your
left
whisker
this
morning
said
anthea
politely
nothing
to
boast
of
said
it
it
had
rather
a
restless
night
but
thank
you
for
asking
i
say
said
robert
do
you
feel
up
to
giving
wishes
because
we
very
much
want
an
extra
besides
the
regular
one
the
extra
a
very
little
one
he
added
reassuringly
humph
said
the
if
you
read
this
story
aloud
please
pronounce
humph
exactly
as
it
is
spelt
for
that
is
how
he
said
it
humph
do
you
know
until
i
heard
you
being
disagreeable
to
each
other
just
over
my
head
and
so
loud
too
i
really
quite
thought
i
had
dreamed
you
all
i
do
have
very
odd
dreams
sometimes
do
you
jane
hurried
to
say
so
as
to
get
away
from
the
subject
of
disagreeableness
i
wish
she
added
politely
you
tell
us
about
your
dreams
they
must
be
awfully
interesting
is
that
the
day
wish
said
the
yawning
cyril
muttered
something
about
just
like
a
girl
and
the
rest
stood
silent
if
they
said
yes
then
to
the
other
wishes
they
had
decided
to
ask
for
if
they
said
no
it
would
be
very
rude
and
they
had
all
been
taught
manners
and
had
learned
a
little
too
which
is
not
at
all
the
same
thing
a
sigh
of
relief
broke
from
all
lips
when
the
said
if
i
do
i
sha
have
strength
to
give
you
a
second
wish
not
even
good
tempers
or
or
manners
or
little
things
like
that
we
do
want
you
to
put
yourself
out
at
all
about
things
we
can
manage
them
quite
well
ourselves
said
cyril
eagerly
while
the
others
looked
guiltily
at
each
other
and
wished
the
fairy
would
not
keep
all
on
about
good
tempers
but
give
them
one
good
scolding
if
it
wanted
to
and
then
have
done
with
it
well
said
the
psammead
putting
out
his
long
snail
eyes
so
suddenly
that
one
of
them
nearly
went
into
the
round
boy
eye
of
robert
have
the
little
wish
first
we
do
want
the
servants
to
notice
the
gifts
you
give
us
are
kind
enough
to
give
us
said
anthea
in
a
whisper
are
kind
enough
to
give
us
i
mean
said
robert
the
fairy
swelled
himself
out
a
bit
let
his
breath
go
and
said
i
done
for
you
it
was
quite
easy
people
do
notice
things
much
anyway
what
the
next
wish
we
want
said
robert
slowly
to
be
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
something
or
other
avarice
said
jane
so
it
is
said
the
fairy
unexpectedly
but
it
wo
do
you
much
good
that
one
comfort
it
muttered
to
itself
come
i
ca
go
beyond
dreams
you
know
how
much
do
you
want
and
will
you
have
it
in
gold
or
notes
gold
please
and
millions
of
it
this
full
be
enough
said
the
fairy
in
an
manner
oh
then
go
out
before
i
begin
or
you
be
buried
alive
in
it
it
made
its
skinny
arms
so
long
and
waved
them
so
frighteningly
that
the
children
ran
as
hard
as
they
could
towards
the
road
by
which
carts
used
to
come
to
the
only
anthea
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
shout
a
timid
i
hope
your
whisker
will
be
better
as
she
ran
on
the
road
they
turned
and
looked
back
and
they
had
to
shut
their
eyes
and
open
them
very
slowly
a
little
bit
at
a
time
because
the
sight
was
too
dazzling
for
their
eyes
to
be
able
to
bear
it
was
something
like
trying
to
look
at
the
sun
at
high
noon
on
midsummer
day
for
the
whole
of
the
was
full
right
up
to
the
very
top
with
new
shining
gold
pieces
and
all
the
little
little
front
doors
were
covered
out
of
sight
where
the
road
for
carts
wound
into
the
the
gold
lay
in
heaps
like
stones
lie
by
the
roadside
and
a
great
bank
of
shining
gold
shelved
down
from
where
it
lay
flat
and
smooth
between
the
tall
sides
of
the
and
all
the
gleaming
heaps
was
minted
gold
and
on
the
sides
and
edges
of
these
countless
coins
the
sun
shone
and
sparkled
and
glowed
and
gleamed
till
the
quarry
looked
like
the
mouth
of
a
smelting
furnace
or
one
of
the
fairy
halls
that
you
see
sometimes
in
the
sky
at
sunset
the
children
stood
with
their
mouths
open
and
no
one
said
a
word
at
last
robert
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
loose
coins
from
the
edge
of
the
heap
by
the
and
looked
at
it
he
looked
on
both
sides
then
he
said
in
a
low
voice
quite
different
to
his
own
not
sovereigns
it
gold
anyway
said
cyril
and
now
they
all
began
to
talk
at
once
they
all
picked
up
the
golden
treasure
by
handfuls
and
let
it
run
through
their
fingers
like
water
and
the
chink
it
made
as
it
fell
was
wonderful
music
at
first
they
quite
forgot
to
think
of
spending
the
money
it
was
so
nice
to
play
with
jane
sat
down
between
two
heaps
of
the
gold
and
robert
began
to
bury
her
as
you
bury
your
father
in
sand
when
you
are
at
the
seaside
and
he
has
gone
to
sleep
on
the
beach
with
his
newspaper
over
his
face
but
jane
was
not
half
buried
before
she
cried
out
oh
stop
it
too
heavy
it
hurts
robert
said
bosh
and
went
on
let
me
out
i
tell
you
cried
jane
and
was
taken
out
very
white
and
trembling
a
little
you
no
idea
what
it
like
said
she
it
like
stones
on
you
or
like
chains
look
here
cyril
said
if
this
is
to
do
us
any
good
it
no
good
our
staying
gasping
at
it
like
this
let
fill
our
pockets
and
go
and
buy
things
do
you
forget
it
wo
last
after
sunset
i
wish
we
asked
the
sammyadd
why
things
do
turn
to
stone
perhaps
this
will
tell
you
what
there
a
pony
and
cart
in
the
village
do
you
want
to
buy
that
asked
jane
no
silly
we
it
and
then
we
go
to
rochester
and
buy
heaps
and
heaps
of
things
look
here
let
each
take
as
much
as
we
can
carry
but
it
not
sovereigns
they
got
a
man
head
on
one
side
and
a
thing
like
the
ace
of
spades
on
the
other
fill
your
pockets
with
it
i
tell
you
and
come
along
you
can
talk
as
we
go
if
you
talk
cyril
sat
down
and
began
to
fill
his
pockets
you
made
fun
of
me
for
getting
father
to
have
nine
pockets
in
my
suit
said
he
but
now
you
see
they
did
for
when
cyril
had
filled
his
nine
pockets
and
his
handkerchief
and
the
space
between
himself
and
his
shirt
front
with
the
gold
coins
he
had
to
stand
up
but
he
staggered
and
had
to
sit
down
again
in
a
hurry
throw
out
some
of
the
cargo
said
robert
you
sink
the
ship
old
chap
that
comes
of
nine
pockets
and
cyril
had
to
do
so
then
they
set
off
to
walk
to
the
village
it
was
more
than
a
mile
and
the
road
was
very
dusty
indeed
and
the
sun
seemed
to
get
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
gold
in
their
pockets
got
heavier
and
heavier
it
was
jane
who
said
i
do
see
how
we
to
spend
it
all
there
must
be
thousands
of
pounds
among
the
lot
of
us
i
going
to
leave
some
of
mine
behind
this
stump
in
the
hedge
and
directly
we
get
to
the
village
we
buy
some
biscuits
i
know
it
long
past
she
took
out
a
handful
or
two
of
gold
and
hid
it
in
the
hollows
of
an
old
hornbeam
how
round
and
yellow
they
are
she
said
do
you
wish
they
were
made
of
gingerbread
and
we
were
going
to
eat
them
well
they
not
and
we
not
said
cyril
come
on
but
they
came
on
heavily
and
wearily
before
they
reached
the
village
more
than
one
stump
in
the
hedge
concealed
its
little
hoard
of
hidden
treasure
yet
they
reached
the
village
with
about
twelve
hundred
guineas
in
their
pockets
but
in
spite
of
this
inside
wealth
they
looked
quite
ordinary
outside
and
no
one
would
have
thought
they
could
have
more
than
a
each
at
the
outside
the
haze
of
heat
the
blue
of
the
wood
smoke
made
a
sort
of
dim
misty
cloud
over
the
red
roofs
of
the
village
the
four
sat
down
heavily
on
the
first
bench
to
which
they
came
it
happened
to
be
outside
the
blue
boar
inn
illustration
he
staggered
and
had
to
sit
down
again
in
a
hurry
it
was
decided
that
cyril
should
go
into
the
blue
boar
and
ask
for
because
as
anthea
said
it
was
not
wrong
for
men
to
go
into
only
for
children
and
cyril
is
nearer
being
a
man
than
us
because
he
is
the
eldest
so
he
went
the
others
sat
in
the
sun
and
waited
oh
how
hot
it
is
said
robert
dogs
put
their
tongues
out
when
they
hot
i
wonder
if
it
would
cool
us
at
all
to
put
out
ours
we
might
try
jane
said
and
they
all
put
their
tongues
out
as
far
as
ever
they
could
go
so
that
it
quite
stretched
their
throats
but
it
only
seemed
to
make
them
thirstier
than
ever
besides
annoying
everyone
who
went
by
so
they
took
their
tongues
in
again
just
as
cyril
came
back
with
i
had
to
pay
for
it
out
of
my
own
money
though
that
i
was
going
to
buy
rabbits
with
he
said
they
would
change
the
gold
and
when
i
pulled
out
a
handful
the
man
just
laughed
and
said
it
was
and
i
got
some
too
out
of
a
glass
jar
on
the
and
some
biscuits
with
caraways
in
the
were
both
soft
and
dry
and
the
biscuits
were
dry
too
and
yet
soft
which
biscuits
ought
not
to
be
but
the
made
up
for
everything
it
my
turn
now
to
try
to
buy
something
with
the
money
anthea
said
i
next
eldest
where
is
the
kept
it
was
at
the
chequers
and
anthea
went
in
the
back
way
to
the
yard
because
they
all
knew
that
little
girls
ought
not
to
go
into
the
bars
of
she
came
out
as
she
herself
said
pleased
but
not
proud
he
be
ready
in
a
brace
of
shakes
he
says
she
remarked
and
to
have
one
sovereign
or
whatever
it
is
to
drive
us
into
rochester
and
back
besides
waiting
there
till
we
got
everything
we
want
i
think
i
managed
very
well
you
think
yourself
jolly
clever
i
daresay
said
cyril
moodily
how
did
you
do
it
i
was
jolly
clever
enough
to
go
taking
handfuls
of
money
out
of
my
pocket
to
make
it
seem
cheap
anyway
she
retorted
i
just
found
a
young
man
doing
something
to
a
horse
legs
with
a
sponge
and
a
pail
and
i
held
out
one
sovereign
and
i
said
you
know
what
this
is
he
said
and
he
call
his
father
and
the
old
man
came
and
he
said
it
was
a
spade
guinea
and
he
said
was
it
my
own
to
do
as
i
liked
with
and
i
said
and
i
asked
about
the
and
i
said
he
could
have
the
guinea
if
he
drive
us
into
rochester
and
his
name
is
crispin
and
he
said
oh
it
was
a
new
sensation
to
be
driven
in
a
smart
along
pretty
country
roads
it
was
very
pleasant
too
which
is
not
always
the
case
with
new
sensations
quite
apart
from
the
beautiful
plans
of
spending
the
money
which
each
child
made
as
they
went
along
silently
of
course
and
quite
to
itself
for
they
felt
it
would
never
have
done
to
let
the
old
innkeeper
hear
them
talk
in
the
affluent
sort
of
way
in
which
they
were
thinking
the
old
man
put
them
down
by
the
bridge
at
their
request
if
you
were
going
to
buy
a
carriage
and
horses
where
would
you
go
asked
cyril
as
if
he
were
only
asking
for
the
sake
of
something
to
say
billy
peasemarsh
at
the
saracen
head
said
the
old
man
promptly
though
all
forbid
i
should
recommend
any
man
where
it
a
question
of
horses
no
more
than
i
take
anybody
else
recommending
if
i
was
one
but
if
your
pa
thinking
of
a
rig
of
any
sort
there
ai
a
straighter
man
in
rochester
nor
civiller
spoken
than
billy
though
i
says
it
thank
you
said
cyril
the
saracen
head
and
now
the
children
began
to
see
one
of
the
laws
of
nature
turn
upside
down
and
stand
on
its
head
like
an
acrobat
any
person
would
tell
you
that
money
is
hard
to
get
and
easy
to
spend
but
the
fairy
money
had
been
easy
to
get
and
spending
it
was
not
only
hard
it
was
almost
impossible
the
of
rochester
seemed
to
shrink
to
a
from
the
glittering
fairy
gold
furrin
money
they
called
it
for
the
most
part
to
begin
with
anthea
who
had
had
the
misfortune
to
sit
on
her
hat
earlier
in
the
day
wished
to
buy
another
she
chose
a
very
beautiful
one
trimmed
with
pink
roses
and
the
blue
breasts
of
peacocks
it
was
marked
in
the
window
paris
model
three
guineas
i
glad
she
said
because
it
says
guineas
and
not
sovereigns
which
we
have
got
but
when
she
took
three
of
the
spade
guineas
in
her
hand
which
was
by
this
time
rather
dirty
owing
to
her
not
having
put
on
gloves
before
going
to
the
the
young
lady
in
the
shop
looked
very
hard
at
her
and
went
and
whispered
something
to
an
older
and
uglier
lady
also
in
black
silk
and
then
they
gave
her
back
the
money
and
said
it
was
not
current
coin
it
good
money
said
anthea
and
it
my
own
i
daresay
said
the
lady
but
it
not
the
kind
of
money
fashionable
now
and
we
do
care
about
taking
it
i
believe
they
think
we
stolen
it
said
anthea
rejoining
the
others
in
the
street
if
we
had
gloves
they
would
think
we
were
so
dishonest
it
my
hands
being
so
dirty
fills
their
minds
with
doubts
so
they
chose
a
humble
shop
and
the
girls
bought
cotton
gloves
the
kind
at
a
shilling
but
when
they
offered
a
guinea
the
woman
looked
at
it
through
her
spectacles
and
said
she
had
no
change
so
the
gloves
had
to
be
paid
for
out
of
cyril
money
with
which
he
meant
to
buy
rabbits
and
so
had
the
green
imitation
purse
at
which
had
been
bought
at
the
same
time
they
tried
several
more
shops
the
kinds
where
you
buy
toys
and
perfume
and
silk
handkerchiefs
and
books
and
fancy
boxes
of
stationery
and
photographs
of
objects
of
interest
in
the
vicinity
but
nobody
cared
to
change
a
guinea
that
day
in
rochester
and
as
they
went
from
shop
to
shop
they
got
dirtier
and
dirtier
and
their
hair
got
more
and
more
untidy
and
jane
slipped
and
fell
down
on
a
part
of
the
road
where
a
water
cart
had
just
gone
by
also
they
got
very
hungry
but
they
found
no
one
would
give
them
anything
to
eat
for
their
guineas
after
trying
two
baker
shops
in
vain
they
became
so
hungry
perhaps
from
the
smell
of
the
cake
in
the
shops
as
cyril
suggested
that
they
formed
a
plan
of
campaign
in
whispers
and
carried
it
out
in
desperation
they
marched
into
a
third
baker
shop
beale
was
his
name
and
before
the
people
behind
the
counter
could
interfere
each
child
had
seized
three
new
penny
buns
clapped
the
three
together
between
its
dirty
hands
and
taken
a
big
bite
out
of
the
triple
sandwich
then
they
stood
at
bay
with
the
twelve
buns
in
their
hands
and
their
mouths
very
full
indeed
the
shocked
baker
man
bounded
round
the
corner
here
said
cyril
speaking
as
distinctly
as
he
could
and
holding
out
the
guinea
he
got
ready
before
entering
the
shops
pay
yourself
out
of
that
beale
snatched
the
coin
bit
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
illustration
beale
snatched
the
coin
bit
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
off
you
go
he
said
brief
and
stern
like
the
man
in
the
song
but
the
change
said
anthea
who
had
a
saving
mind
change
said
the
man
i
change
you
hout
you
goes
and
you
may
think
yourselves
lucky
i
do
send
for
the
police
to
find
out
where
you
got
it
in
the
gardens
of
the
castle
the
millionaires
finished
the
buns
and
though
the
curranty
softness
of
these
were
delicious
and
acted
like
a
charm
in
raising
the
spirits
of
the
party
yet
even
the
stoutest
heart
quailed
at
the
thought
of
venturing
to
sound
billy
peasemarsh
at
the
saracen
head
on
the
subject
of
a
horse
and
carriage
the
boys
would
have
given
up
the
idea
but
jane
was
always
a
hopeful
child
and
anthea
generally
an
obstinate
one
and
their
earnestness
prevailed
the
whole
party
by
this
time
indescribably
dirty
therefore
betook
itself
to
the
saracen
head
the
of
attack
having
been
successful
at
the
chequers
was
tried
again
here
peasemarsh
was
in
the
yard
and
robert
opened
the
business
in
these
terms
they
tell
me
you
have
a
lot
of
horses
and
carriages
to
sell
it
had
been
agreed
that
robert
should
be
spokesman
because
in
books
it
is
always
gentlemen
who
buy
horses
and
not
ladies
and
cyril
had
had
his
go
at
the
blue
boar
they
tell
you
true
young
man
said
peasemarsh
he
was
a
long
lean
man
with
very
blue
eyes
and
a
tight
mouth
and
narrow
lips
we
should
like
to
buy
some
please
said
robert
politely
i
daresay
you
would
will
you
show
us
a
few
please
to
choose
from
who
are
you
of
inquired
billy
peasemarsh

said
robert
if

not
too
much
trouble
it
would
be
very
kind
of
you
peasemarsh
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
laughed
and
they
did
not
like
the
way
he
did
it
then
he
shouted
willum
a
stooping
ostler
appeared
in
a
stable
door
here

and

at
this
young
dook

the
whole

lock

his
pocket

i
go
bail
willum
eyes
followed
his
master
pointing
thumb
with
contemptuous
interest

sure
he
said
but
robert
spoke
though
both
the
girls
were
now
pulling
at
his
jacket
and
begging
him
to
come
along
he
spoke
and
he
was
very
angry
he
said
i

a
young
duke
and
i
never
pretended
to
be
and
as
for
tuppence
what
do
you
call
this
and
before
the
others
could
stop
him
he
had
pulled
out
two
fat
handfuls
of
shining
guineas
and
held
them
out
for
peasemarsh
to
look
at
he
did
look
he
snatched
one
up
in
his
finger
and
thumb
he
bit
it
and
jane
expected
him
to
say
the
best
horse
in
my
stables
is
at
your
service
but
the
others
knew
better
still
it
was
a
blow
even
to
the
most
desponding
when
he
said
shortly
willum
shut
the
yard
doors
and
willum
grinned
and
went
to
shut
them
said
robert
hastily
we
sha
buy
any
horses
now
whatever
you
say
and
i
hope
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
he
had
seen
a
little
side
gate
open
and
was
moving
towards
it
as
he
spoke
but
billy
peasemarsh
put
himself
in
the
way
not
so
fast
you
young
he
said
willum
fetch
the
pleece
willum
went
the
children
stood
huddled
together
like
frightened
sheep
and
peasemarsh
spoke
to
them
till
the
pleece
arrived
he
said
many
things
among
other
things
he
said
nice
lot
you
are
are
you
coming
tempting
honest
men
with
your
guineas
they
our
guineas

cyril
boldly
oh

course

more
we
do
oh
no
course

and
dragging
little
gells
into
it
too
i
let
the
gells

pleece
quiet

said
jane
heroically
not
without
the
boys
our
money
just
as
much
as
theirs
you
wicked
old
man
where
you
get
it
then
said
the
man
softening
slightly
which
was
not
at
all
what
the
boys
expected
when
jane
began
to
call
names
jane
cast
a
silent
glance
of
agony
at
the
others
lost
your
tongue
eh
got
it
fast
enough
when
it
for
calling
names
with
come
speak
up
where
you
get
it
out
of
the
said
truthful
jane
next
article
said
the
man
i
tell
you
we
did
jane
said
there
a
fairy
there
all
over
brown
fur
with
ears
like
a
bat
and
eyes
like
a
snail
and
he
gives
you
a
wish
a
day
and
they
all
come
true
touched
in
the
head
eh
said
the
man
in
a
low
voice
all
the
more
shame
to
you
boys
dragging
the
poor
afflicted
child
into
your
sinful
burglaries
she
not
mad
it
true
said
anthea
there
a
fairy
if
i
ever
see
him
again
i
wish
for
something
for
you
at
least
i
would
if
vengeance
was
wicked
so
there
lor
lumme
said
billy
peasemarsh
if
there
ai
another
on
and
now
willum
came
back
with
a
spiteful
grin
on
his
face
and
at
his
back
a
policeman
with
whom
peasemarsh
spoke
long
in
a
hoarse
earnest
whisper
i
daresay
you
right
said
the
policeman
at
last
anyway
i
take
up
on
a
charge
of
unlawful
possession
pending
inquiries
and
the
magistrate
will
deal
with
the
case
send
the
afflicted
ones
to
a
home
as
likely
as
not
and
the
boys
to
a
reformatory
now
then
come
along
youngsters
no
use
making
a
fuss
you
bring
the
gells
along
peasemarsh
sir
and
i
shepherd
the
boys
speechless
with
rage
and
horror
the
four
children
were
driven
along
the
streets
of
rochester
tears
of
anger
and
shame
blinded
them
so
that
when
robert
ran
right
into
a
he
did
not
recognise
her
till
a
voice
said
well
if
ever
i
did
oh
master
robert
whatever
have
you
been
of
now
and
another
voice
quite
as
well
known
said
panty
want
go
own
panty
they
had
run
into
martha
and
the
baby
illustration
they
had
run
into
martha
and
the
baby
martha
behaved
admirably
she
refused
to
believe
a
word
of
the
policeman
story
or
of
peasemarsh
either
even
when
they
made
robert
turn
out
his
pockets
in
an
archway
and
show
the
guineas
i
do
see
nothing
she
said
you
gone
out
of
your
senses
you
two
there
ai
any
gold
there
only
the
poor
child
hands
all
over
dirt
and
like
the
very
chimbley
oh
that
i
should
ever
see
the
day
and
the
children
thought
this
very
noble
of
martha
even
if
rather
wicked
till
they
remembered
how
the
fairy
had
promised
that
the
servants
should
never
notice
any
of
the
fairy
gifts
so
of
course
martha
could
see
the
gold
and
so
was
only
speaking
the
truth
and
that
was
quite
right
of
course
but
not
extra
noble
it
was
getting
dusk
when
they
reached
the
the
policeman
told
his
tale
to
an
inspector
who
sat
in
a
large
bare
room
with
a
thing
like
a
clumsy
at
one
end
to
put
prisoners
in
robert
wondered
whether
it
was
a
cell
or
a
dock
produce
the
coins
officer
said
the
inspector
turn
out
your
pockets
said
the
constable
cyril
desperately
plunged
his
hands
in
his
pockets
stood
still
a
moment
and
then
began
to
laugh
an
odd
sort
of
laugh
that
hurt
and
that
felt
much
more
like
crying
his
pockets
were
empty
so
were
the
pockets
of
the
others
for
of
course
at
sunset
all
the
fairy
gold
had
vanished
away
turn
out
your
pockets
and
stop
that
noise
said
the
inspector
cyril
turned
out
his
pockets
every
one
of
the
nine
which
enriched
his
suit
and
every
pocket
was
empty
well
said
the
inspector
i
do
know
how
they
done
it
artful
little
beggars
they
walked
in
front
of
me
the
way
so
as
for
me
to
keep
my
eye
on
them
and
not
to
attract
a
crowd
and
obstruct
the
traffic
it
very
remarkable
said
the
inspector
frowning
if
you
done
of
the
innocent
children
said
martha
i
hire
a
private
carriage
and
we
drive
home
to
their
mansion
you
hear
about
this
again
young
man
i
told
you
they
had
got
any
gold
when
you
were
pretending
to
see
it
in
their
poor
helpless
hands
it
early
in
the
day
for
a
constable
on
duty
not
to
be
able
to
trust
his
own
eyes
as
to
the
other
one
the
less
said
the
better
he
keeps
the
saracen
head
and
he
knows
best
what
his
like
illustration
he
said
now
then
to
the
policeman
and
peasemarsh
take
them
away
for
goodness
sake
said
the
inspector
crossly
but
as
they
left
the
he
said
now
then
to
the
policeman
and
peasemarsh
and
he
said
it
twenty
times
as
crossly
as
he
had
spoken
to
martha
martha
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
took
them
home
in
a
very
grand
carriage
because
the
carrier
cart
was
gone
and
though
she
had
stood
by
them
so
nobly
with
the
police
she
was
so
angry
with
them
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
for
trapesing
into
rochester
by
themselves
that
none
of
them
dared
to
mention
the
old
man
with
the
from
the
village
who
was
waiting
for
them
in
rochester
and
so
after
one
day
of
boundless
wealth
the
children
found
themselves
sent
to
bed
in
deep
disgrace
and
only
enriched
by
two
pairs
of
cotton
gloves
dirty
inside
because
of
the
state
of
the
hands
they
had
been
put
on
to
cover
an
imitation
purse
and
twelve
penny
buns
long
since
digested
the
thing
that
troubled
them
most
was
the
fear
that
the
old
guinea
might
have
disappeared
at
sunset
with
all
the
rest
so
they
went
down
to
the
village
next
day
to
apologise
for
not
meeting
him
in
rochester
and
to
they
found
him
very
friendly
the
guinea
had
not
disappeared
and
he
had
bored
a
hole
in
it
and
hung
it
on
his
as
for
the
guinea
the
baker
took
the
children
felt
they
not
care
whether
it
had
vanished
or
not
which
was
not
perhaps
very
honest
but
on
the
other
hand
was
not
wholly
unnatural
but
afterwards
this
preyed
on
anthea
mind
and
at
last
she
secretly
sent
twelve
postage
stamps
by
post
to
beale
baker
rochester
inside
she
wrote
to
pay
for
the
buns
i
hope
the
guinea
did
disappear
for
that
baker
was
really
not
at
all
a
nice
man
and
besides
penny
buns
are
seven
for
sixpence
in
all
really
respectable
shops
chapter
iii
being
wanted
the
morning
after
the
children
had
been
the
possessors
of
boundless
wealth
and
had
been
unable
to
buy
anything
really
useful
or
enjoyable
with
it
except
two
pairs
of
cotton
gloves
twelve
penny
buns
an
imitation
purse
and
a
ride
in
a
they
awoke
without
any
of
the
enthusiastic
happiness
which
they
had
felt
on
the
previous
day
when
they
remembered
how
they
had
had
the
luck
to
find
a
psammead
or
and
to
receive
its
promise
to
grant
them
a
new
wish
every
day
for
now
they
had
had
two
wishes
beauty
and
wealth
and
neither
had
exactly
made
them
happy
but
the
happening
of
strange
things
even
if
they
are
not
completely
pleasant
things
is
more
amusing
than
those
times
when
nothing
happens
but
meals
and
they
are
not
always
completely
pleasant
especially
on
the
days
when
it
is
cold
mutton
or
hash
there
was
no
chance
of
talking
things
over
before
breakfast
because
everyone
overslept
itself
as
it
happened
and
it
needed
a
vigorous
and
determined
struggle
to
get
dressed
so
as
to
be
only
ten
minutes
late
for
breakfast
during
this
meal
some
efforts
were
made
to
deal
with
the
question
of
the
psammead
in
an
impartial
spirit
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
discuss
anything
thoroughly
and
at
the
same
time
to
attend
faithfully
to
your
baby
brother
breakfast
needs
the
baby
was
particularly
lively
that
morning
he
not
only
wriggled
his
body
through
the
bar
of
his
high
chair
and
hung
by
his
head
choking
and
purple
but
he
seized
a
tablespoon
with
desperate
suddenness
hit
cyril
heavily
on
the
head
with
it
and
then
cried
because
it
was
taken
away
from
him
he
put
his
fat
fist
in
his
and
demanded
nam
which
was
only
allowed
for
tea
he
sang
he
put
his
feet
on
the
table
he
clamoured
to
go
walky
the
conversation
was
something
like
this
look
here
about
that
look
out
he
have
the
milk
over
milk
removed
to
a
safe
distance
yes
about
that
fairy
no
lamb
dear
give
panther
the
narky
poon
then
cyril
tried
nothing
we
had
yet
has
turned
out
he
nearly
had
the
mustard
that
time
i
wonder
whether
we
better
wish
hullo
you
done
it
now
my
boy
and
in
a
flash
of
glass
and
pink
the
bowl
of
golden
carp
in
the
middle
of
the
table
rolled
on
its
side
and
poured
a
flood
of
mixed
water
and
into
the
baby
lap
and
into
the
laps
of
the
others
everyone
was
almost
as
much
upset
as
the
the
lamb
only
remaining
calm
when
the
pool
on
the
floor
had
been
mopped
up
and
the
leaping
gasping
had
been
collected
and
put
back
in
the
water
the
baby
was
taken
away
to
be
entirely
by
martha
and
most
of
the
others
had
to
change
completely
the
pinafores
and
jackets
that
had
been
bathed
in
were
hung
out
to
dry
and
then
it
turned
out
that
jane
must
either
mend
the
dress
she
had
torn
the
day
before
or
appear
all
day
in
her
best
petticoat
it
was
white
and
soft
and
frilly
and
trimmed
with
lace
and
very
very
pretty
quite
as
pretty
as
a
frock
if
not
more
so
only
it
was
a
frock
and
martha
word
was
law
she
would
let
jane
wear
her
best
frock
and
she
refused
to
listen
for
a
moment
to
robert
suggestion
that
jane
should
wear
her
best
petticoat
and
call
it
a
dress
it
not
respectable
she
said
and
when
people
say
that
it
no
use
anyone
saying
anything
you
find
this
out
for
yourselves
some
day
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
jane
to
mend
her
frock
the
hole
had
been
torn
the
day
before
when
she
happened
to
tumble
down
in
the
high
street
of
rochester
just
where
a
had
passed
on
its
silvery
way
she
had
grazed
her
knee
and
her
stocking
was
much
more
than
grazed
and
her
dress
was
cut
by
the
same
stone
which
had
attended
to
the
knee
and
the
stocking
of
course
the
others
were
not
such
sneaks
as
to
abandon
a
comrade
in
misfortune
so
they
all
sat
on
the
round
the
and
jane
darned
away
for
dear
life
the
lamb
was
still
in
the
hands
of
martha
having
its
clothes
changed
so
conversation
was
possible
anthea
and
robert
timidly
tried
to
conceal
their
inmost
thought
which
was
that
the
psammead
was
not
to
be
trusted
but
cyril
said
speak
out
say
what
you
got
to
say
i
hate
hinting
and
know
and
sneakish
ways
like
that
so
then
robert
said
as
in
honour
bound
sneak
yourself
anthea
and
me
were
so
as
you
two
were
so
we
got
changed
quicker
and
we
had
time
to
think
it
over
and
if
you
ask
me
i
did
ask
you
said
jane
biting
off
a
needleful
of
thread
as
she
had
always
been
strictly
forbidden
to
do
perhaps
you
do
know
that
if
you
bite
off
ends
of
cotton
and
swallow
them
they
wind
tight
round
your
heart
and
kill
you
my
nurse
told
me
this
and
she
told
me
also
about
the
earth
going
round
the
sun
now
what
is
one
to
believe
what
with
nurses
and
science
i
do
care
who
asks
or
who
does
said
robert
but
anthea
and
i
think
the
sammyadd
is
a
spiteful
brute
if
it
can
give
us
our
wishes
i
suppose
it
can
give
itself
its
own
and
i
feel
almost
sure
it
wishes
every
time
that
our
wishes
sha
do
us
any
good
let
let
the
tiresome
beast
alone
and
just
go
and
have
a
jolly
good
game
of
forts
on
our
own
in
the
you
will
remember
that
the
house
where
these
children
were
spending
their
holidays
lay
between
a
and
a
cyril
and
jane
were
more
hopeful
they
generally
were
i
do
think
the
sammyadd
does
it
on
purpose
cyril
said
and
after
all
it
silly
to
wish
for
boundless
wealth
fifty
pounds
in
pieces
would
have
been
much
more
sensible
and
wishing
to
be
beautiful
as
the
day
was
simply
donkeyish
i
do
want
to
be
disagreeable
but
it
we
must
try
to
find
a
really
useful
wish
and
wish
it
jane
dropped
her
work
and
said
i
think
so
too
it
too
silly
to
have
a
chance
like
this
and
not
use
it
i
never
heard
of
anyone
else
outside
a
book
who
had
such
a
chance
there
must
be
simply
heaps
of
things
we
could
wish
for
that
turn
out
dead
sea
fish
like
these
two
things
have
do
let
think
hard
and
wish
something
nice
so
that
we
can
have
a
real
jolly
day
what
there
is
left
of
it
jane
darned
away
again
like
mad
for
time
was
indeed
getting
on
and
everyone
began
to
talk
at
once
if
you
had
been
there
you
could
not
possibly
have
made
head
or
tail
of
the
talk
but
these
children
were
used
to
talking
by
fours
as
soldiers
march
and
each
of
them
could
say
what
it
had
to
say
quite
comfortably
and
listen
to
the
agreeable
sound
of
its
own
voice
and
at
the
same
time
have
of
two
sharp
ears
to
spare
for
listening
to
what
the
others
said
that
is
an
easy
example
in
multiplication
of
vulgar
fractions
but
as
i
daresay
you
ca
do
even
that
i
wo
ask
you
to
tell
me
whether
but
i
will
ask
you
to
believe
me
that
this
was
the
amount
of
ear
each
child
was
able
to
lend
to
the
others
lending
ears
was
common
in
roman
times
as
we
learn
from
shakespeare
but
i
fear
i
am
getting
too
instructive
when
the
frock
was
darned
the
start
for
the
was
delayed
by
martha
insisting
on
everybody
washing
its
hands
which
was
nonsense
because
nobody
had
been
doing
anything
at
all
except
jane
and
how
can
you
get
dirty
doing
nothing
that
is
a
difficult
question
and
i
can
not
answer
it
on
paper
in
real
life
i
could
very
soon
show
you
or
you
me
which
is
much
more
likely
during
the
conversation
in
which
the
six
ears
were
lent
there
were
four
children
so
sum
comes
right
it
had
been
decided
that
fifty
pounds
in
pieces
was
the
right
wish
to
have
and
the
lucky
children
who
could
have
anything
in
the
wide
world
by
just
wishing
for
it
hurriedly
started
for
the
to
express
their
wishes
to
the
psammead
martha
caught
them
at
the
gate
and
insisted
on
their
taking
the
baby
with
them
illustration
the
lucky
children
hurriedly
started
for
the
gravel
pit
not
want
him
indeed
why
everybody
want
him
a
duck
with
all
their
hearts
they
would
and
you
know
you
promised
your
ma
to
take
him
out
every
blessed
day
said
martha
i
know
we
did
said
robert
in
gloom
but
i
wish
the
lamb
was
quite
so
young
and
small
it
would
be
much
better
fun
taking
him
out
he
mend
of
his
youngness
with
time
said
martha
and
as
for
smallness
i
do
think
you
fancy
carrying
of
him
any
more
however
big
he
was
besides
he
can
walk
a
bit
bless
his
precious
fat
legs
a
ducky
he
feels
the
benefit
of
the
air
so
he
does
a
pet
with
this
and
a
kiss
she
plumped
the
lamb
into
anthea
arms
and
went
back
to
make
new
pinafores
on
the
she
was
a
rapid
performer
on
this
instrument
the
lamb
laughed
with
pleasure
and
said
walky
wif
panty
and
rode
on
robert
back
with
yells
of
joy
and
tried
to
feed
jane
with
stones
and
altogether
made
himself
so
agreeable
that
nobody
could
long
be
sorry
that
he
was
of
the
party
the
enthusiastic
jane
even
suggested
that
they
should
devote
a
wishes
to
assuring
the
baby
future
by
asking
such
gifts
for
him
as
the
good
fairies
give
to
infant
princes
in
proper
but
anthea
soberly
reminded
her
that
as
the
wishes
only
lasted
till
sunset
they
could
not
ensure
any
benefit
to
the
baby
later
years
and
jane
owned
that
it
would
be
better
to
wish
for
fifty
pounds
in
pieces
and
buy
the
lamb
a
fifteen
like
those
in
the
big
stores
with
a
part
of
the
money
it
was
settled
that
as
soon
as
they
had
wished
for
the
money
and
got
it
they
would
get
crispin
to
drive
them
into
rochester
again
taking
martha
with
them
if
they
could
not
get
out
of
taking
her
and
they
would
make
a
list
of
things
they
really
wanted
before
they
started
full
of
high
hopes
and
excellent
resolutions
they
went
round
the
safe
slow
to
the
and
as
they
went
in
between
the
mounds
of
gravel
a
sudden
thought
came
to
them
and
would
have
turned
their
ruddy
cheeks
pale
if
they
had
been
children
in
a
book
being
real
live
children
it
only
made
them
stop
and
look
at
each
other
with
rather
blank
and
silly
expressions
for
now
they
remembered
that
yesterday
when
they
had
asked
the
psammead
for
boundless
wealth
and
it
was
getting
ready
to
fill
the
quarry
with
the
minted
gold
of
bright
guineas
millions
of
them
it
had
told
the
children
to
run
along
outside
the
quarry
for
fear
they
should
be
buried
alive
in
the
heavy
splendid
treasure
and
they
had
run
and
so
it
happened
that
they
had
not
had
time
to
mark
the
spot
where
the
psammead
was
with
a
ring
of
stones
as
before
and
it
was
this
thought
that
put
such
silly
expressions
on
their
faces
never
mind
said
the
hopeful
jane
we
soon
find
him
but
this
though
easily
said
was
hard
in
the
doing
they
looked
and
they
looked
and
though
they
found
their
seaside
spades
nowhere
could
they
find
the
at
last
they
had
to
sit
down
and
rest
not
at
all
because
they
were
weary
or
disheartened
of
course
but
because
the
lamb
insisted
on
being
put
down
and
you
can
not
look
very
carefully
after
anything
you
may
have
happened
to
lose
in
the
sand
if
you
have
an
active
baby
to
look
after
at
the
same
time
get
someone
to
drop
your
best
knife
in
the
sand
next
time
you
go
to
the
seashore
and
then
take
your
baby
brother
with
you
when
you
go
to
look
for
it
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
right
the
lamb
as
martha
had
said
was
feeling
the
benefit
of
the
country
air
and
he
was
as
frisky
as
a
sandhopper
the
elder
ones
longed
to
go
on
talking
about
the
new
wishes
they
would
have
when
or
if
they
found
the
psammead
again
but
the
lamb
wished
to
enjoy
himself
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
threw
a
handful
of
sand
into
face
and
then
suddenly
burrowed
his
own
head
in
the
sand
and
waved
his
fat
legs
in
the
air
then
of
course
the
sand
got
into
his
eyes
as
it
had
into
anthea
and
he
howled
the
thoughtful
robert
had
brought
one
solid
brown
bottle
of
with
him
relying
on
a
thirst
that
had
never
yet
failed
him
this
had
to
be
uncorked
hurriedly
it
was
the
only
wet
thing
within
reach
and
it
was
necessary
to
wash
the
sand
out
of
the
lamb
eyes
somehow
of
course
the
ginger
hurt
horribly
and
he
howled
more
than
ever
and
amid
his
anguish
of
kicking
the
bottle
was
upset
and
the
beautiful
frothed
out
into
the
sand
and
was
lost
for
ever
it
was
then
that
robert
usually
a
very
patient
brother
so
far
forgot
himself
as
to
say
anybody
would
want
him
indeed
only
they
do
martha
does
not
really
or
she
jolly
well
keep
him
with
her
he
a
little
nuisance
that
what
he
is
it
too
bad
i
only
wish
everybody
want
him
with
all
their
hearts
we
might
get
some
peace
in
our
lives
the
lamb
stopped
howling
now
because
jane
had
suddenly
remembered
that
there
is
only
one
safe
way
of
taking
things
out
of
little
eyes
and
that
is
with
your
own
soft
wet
tongue
it
is
quite
easy
if
you
love
the
baby
as
much
as
you
ought
to
do
then
there
was
a
little
silence
robert
was
not
proud
of
himself
for
having
been
so
cross
and
the
others
were
not
proud
of
him
either
you
often
notice
that
sort
of
silence
when
someone
has
said
something
it
ought
not
to
and
everyone
else
holds
its
tongue
and
waits
for
the
one
who
ought
to
have
said
it
is
sorry
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
sigh
a
breath
suddenly
let
out
the
children
heads
turned
as
if
there
had
been
a
string
tied
to
each
nose
and
somebody
had
pulled
all
the
strings
at
once
and
everyone
saw
the
sitting
quite
close
to
them
with
the
expression
which
it
used
as
a
smile
on
its
hairy
face
it
said
i
did
that
quite
easily
everyone
wants
him
now
it
does
matter
said
robert
sulkily
because
he
knew
he
had
been
behaving
rather
like
a
pig
no
matter
who
wants
him
there
no
one
here
to
anyhow
ingratitude
said
the
psammead
is
a
dreadful
vice
we
not
ungrateful
jane
made
haste
to
say
but
we
did
want
that
wish
robert
only
just
said
it
ca
you
take
it
back
and
give
us
a
new
one
no
i
ca
the
said
shortly
chopping
and
changing
not
business
you
ought
to
be
careful
what
you
wish
there
was
a
little
boy
once
he
wished
for
a
plesiosaurus
instead
of
an
ichthyosaurus
because
he
was
too
lazy
to
remember
the
easy
names
of
everyday
things
and
his
father
had
been
very
vexed
with
him
and
had
made
him
go
to
bed
before
and
would
let
him
go
out
in
the
nice
flint
boat
along
with
the
other
children
it
was
the
annual
next
day
and
he
came
and
flung
himself
down
near
me
on
the
morning
of
the
treat
and
he
kicked
his
little
prehistoric
legs
about
and
said
he
wished
he
was
dead
and
of
course
then
he
was
how
awful
said
the
children
all
together
only
till
sunset
of
course
the
psammead
said
still
it
was
quite
enough
for
his
father
and
mother
and
he
caught
it
when
he
woke
up
i
tell
you
he
did
turn
to
stone
i
forget
why
but
there
must
have
been
some
reason
they
did
know
being
dead
is
only
being
asleep
and
you
bound
to
wake
up
somewhere
or
other
either
where
you
go
to
sleep
or
in
some
better
place
you
may
be
sure
he
caught
it
giving
them
such
a
turn
why
he
was
allowed
to
taste
megatherium
for
a
month
after
that
nothing
but
oysters
and
periwinkles
and
common
things
like
that
all
the
children
were
quite
crushed
by
this
terrible
tale
they
looked
at
the
psammead
in
horror
suddenly
the
lamb
perceived
that
something
brown
and
furry
was
near
him
poof
poof
poofy
he
said
and
made
a
grab
illustration
poof
poof
poofy
he
said
and
made
a
grab
it
not
a
pussy
anthea
was
beginning
when
the
leaped
back
oh
my
left
whisker
it
said
do
let
him
touch
me
he
wet
its
fur
stood
on
end
with
horror
and
indeed
a
good
deal
of
the
had
been
spilt
on
the
blue
smock
of
the
lamb
the
psammead
dug
with
its
hands
and
feet
and
vanished
in
an
instant
and
a
whirl
of
sand
the
children
marked
the
spot
with
a
ring
of
stones
we
may
as
well
get
along
home
said
robert
i
say
i
sorry
but
anyway
if
it
no
good
it
no
harm
and
we
know
where
the
sandy
thing
is
for
the
others
were
noble
no
one
reproached
robert
at
all
cyril
picked
up
the
lamb
who
was
now
quite
himself
again
and
off
they
went
by
the
safe
the
from
the
joins
the
road
almost
directly
at
the
gate
into
the
road
the
party
stopped
to
shift
the
lamb
from
cyril
back
to
robert
and
as
they
paused
a
very
smart
open
carriage
came
in
sight
with
a
coachman
and
a
groom
on
the
box
and
inside
the
carriage
a
lady
very
grand
indeed
with
a
dress
all
white
lace
and
red
ribbons
and
a
parasol
all
red
and
white
and
a
white
fluffy
dog
on
her
lap
with
a
red
ribbon
round
its
neck
she
looked
at
the
children
and
particularly
at
the
baby
and
she
smiled
at
him
the
children
were
used
to
this
for
the
lamb
was
as
all
the
servants
said
a
very
taking
child
so
they
waved
their
hands
politely
to
the
lady
and
expected
her
to
drive
on
but
she
did
not
instead
she
made
the
coachman
stop
and
she
beckoned
to
cyril
and
when
he
went
up
to
the
carriage
she
said
what
a
dear
darling
duck
of
a
baby
oh
i
so
like
to
adopt
it
do
you
think
its
mother
would
mind
she
mind
very
much
indeed
said
anthea
shortly
oh
but
i
should
bring
it
up
in
luxury
you
know
i
am
lady
chittenden
you
must
have
seen
my
photograph
in
the
illustrated
papers
they
call
me
a
beauty
you
know
but
of
course
that
all
nonsense
anyway
she
opened
the
carriage
door
and
jumped
out
she
had
the
wonderfullest
red
shoes
with
silver
buckles
let
me
hold
him
a
minute
she
said
and
she
took
the
lamb
and
held
him
very
awkwardly
as
if
she
was
not
used
to
babies
then
suddenly
she
jumped
into
the
carriage
with
the
lamb
in
her
arms
and
slammed
the
door
and
said
drive
on
the
lamb
roared
the
little
white
dog
barked
and
the
coachman
hesitated
drive
on
i
tell
you
cried
the
lady
and
the
coachman
did
for
as
he
said
afterwards
it
was
as
much
as
his
place
was
worth
not
to
the
four
children
looked
at
each
other
and
then
with
one
accord
they
rushed
after
the
carriage
and
held
on
behind
down
the
dusty
road
went
the
smart
carriage
and
after
it
at
time
ran
the
twinkling
legs
of
the
lamb
brothers
and
sisters
illustration
at
time
ran
the
twinkling
legs
of
the
lamb
brothers
and
sisters
the
lamb
howled
louder
and
louder
but
presently
his
howls
changed
by
slow
degrees
to
hiccupy
gurgles
and
then
all
was
still
and
they
knew
he
had
gone
to
sleep
the
carriage
went
on
and
the
eight
feet
that
twinkled
through
the
dust
were
growing
quite
stiff
and
tired
before
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
lodge
of
a
grand
park
the
children
crouched
down
behind
the
carriage
and
the
lady
got
out
she
looked
at
the
baby
as
it
lay
on
the
carriage
seat
and
hesitated
the
darling
i
wo
disturb
it
she
said
and
went
into
the
lodge
to
talk
to
the
woman
there
about
a
setting
of
eggs
that
had
not
turned
out
well
the
coachman
and
footman
sprang
from
the
box
and
bent
over
the
sleeping
lamb
fine
boy
wish
he
was
mine
said
the
coachman
he
would
favour
much
said
the
groom
sourly
too
the
coachman
pretended
not
to
hear
he
said
wonder
at
her
now
i
do
really
hates
kids
got
none
of
her
own
and
ca
abide
other
folkses
the
children
crouched
in
the
white
dust
under
the
carriage
exchanged
uncomfortable
glances
tell
you
what
the
coachman
went
on
firmly
blowed
if
i
do
hide
the
little
nipper
in
the
hedge
and
tell
her
his
brothers
took
then
i
come
back
for
him
afterwards
no

said
the
footman
i
took
to
that
kid
so
as
never
was
if
anyone
to
have
him
it
me
so
there
stop
your
talk
the
coachman
rejoined
you
do
want
no
kids
and
if
you
did
one
kid
the
same
as
another
to
you
but
i
a
married
man
and
a
judge
of
breed
i
knows
a
firstrate
yearling
when
i
sees
him
to
him
an
least
said

the
footman
sneeringly
you
enough
what
with
alfred
an
albert
an
louise
an
victor
stanley
and
helena
beatrice
and
another
the
coachman
hit
the
footman
in
the
chin
the
footman
hit
the
coachman
in
the
the
next
minute
the
two
were
fighting
here
and
there
in
and
out
up
and
down
and
all
over
everywhere
and
the
little
dog
jumped
on
the
box
of
the
carriage
and
began
barking
like
mad
illustration
the
next
minute
the
two
were
fighting
cyril
still
crouching
in
the
dust
waddled
on
bent
legs
to
the
side
of
the
carriage
farthest
from
the
battlefield
he
unfastened
the
door
of
the
carriage
the
two
men
were
far
too
much
occupied
with
their
quarrel
to
notice
anything
took
the
lamb
in
his
arms
and
still
stooping
carried
the
sleeping
baby
a
dozen
yards
along
the
road
to
where
a
stile
led
into
a
wood
the
others
followed
and
there
among
the
hazels
and
young
oaks
and
sweet
chestnuts
covered
by
high
they
all
lay
hidden
till
the
angry
voices
of
the
men
were
hushed
at
the
angry
voice
of
the
lady
and
after
a
long
and
anxious
search
the
carriage
at
last
drove
away
my
only
hat
said
cyril
drawing
a
deep
breath
as
the
sound
of
wheels
at
last
died
away
everyone
want
him
now
and
no
mistake
that
sammyadd
has
done
us
again
tricky
brute
for
any
sake
let
get
the
kid
safe
home
so
they
peeped
out
and
finding
on
the
right
hand
only
lonely
white
road
and
nothing
but
lonely
white
road
on
the
left
they
took
courage
and
the
road
anthea
carrying
the
sleeping
lamb
adventures
dogged
their
footsteps
a
boy
with
a
bundle
of
faggots
on
his
back
dropped
his
bundle
by
the
roadside
and
asked
to
look
at
the
baby
and
then
offered
to
carry
him
but
anthea
was
not
to
be
caught
that
way
twice
they
all
walked
on
but
the
boy
followed
and
cyril
and
robert
could
make
him
go
away
till
they
had
more
than
once
invited
him
to
smell
their
fists
afterwards
a
little
girl
in
a
checked
pinafore
actually
followed
them
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
crying
for
the
precious
baby
and
then
she
was
only
got
rid
of
by
threats
of
tying
her
to
a
tree
in
the
wood
with
all
their
pocket
handkerchiefs
so
that
bears
can
come
and
eat
you
as
soon
as
it
gets
dark
said
cyril
severely
then
she
went
off
crying
it
presently
seemed
wise
to
the
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
baby
who
was
wanted
by
everyone
to
hide
in
the
hedge
whenever
they
saw
anyone
coming
and
thus
they
managed
to
prevent
the
lamb
from
arousing
the
inconvenient
affection
of
a
milkman
a
and
a
man
who
drove
a
cart
with
a
paraffin
barrel
at
the
back
of
it
they
were
nearly
home
when
the
worst
thing
of
all
happened
turning
a
corner
suddenly
they
came
upon
two
vans
a
tent
and
a
company
of
gipsies
encamped
by
the
side
of
the
road
the
vans
were
hung
all
round
with
wicker
chairs
and
cradles
and
and
feather
brushes
a
lot
of
ragged
children
were
industriously
making
in
the
road
two
men
lay
on
the
grass
smoking
and
three
women
were
doing
the
family
washing
in
an
old
red
with
the
top
broken
off
in
a
moment
every
gipsy
men
women
and
children
surrounded
anthea
and
the
baby
let
me
hold
him
little
lady
said
one
of
the
gipsy
women
who
had
a
face
and
hair
i
wo
hurt
a
hair
of
his
head
the
little
picture
i
rather
not
said
anthea
let
have
him
said
the
other
woman
whose
face
was
also
of
the
hue
of
mahogany
and
her
hair
in
greasy
curls
i
nineteen
of
my
own
so
i
have
no
said
anthea
bravely
but
her
heart
beat
so
that
it
nearly
choked
her
then
one
of
the
men
pushed
forward
swelp
me
if
it
ai
he
cried
my
own
cheild
have
he
a
strawberry
mark
on
his
left
ear
no
then
he
my
own
babby
stolen
from
me
in
hinnocent
hinfancy
over
and
we
not
the
law
on
yer
this
time
he
snatched
the
baby
from
anthea
who
turned
scarlet
and
burst
into
tears
of
pure
rage
illustration
he
snatched
the
baby
from
anthea
the
others
were
standing
quite
still
this
was
much
the
most
terrible
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
them
even
being
taken
up
by
the
police
in
rochester
was
nothing
to
this
cyril
was
quite
white
and
his
hands
trembled
a
little
but
he
made
a
sign
to
the
others
to
shut
up
he
was
silent
a
minute
thinking
hard
then
he
said
we
do
want
to
keep
him
if
he
yours
but
you
see
he
used
to
us
you
shall
have
him
if
you
want
him
no
no
cried
anthea
and
cyril
glared
at
her
of
course
we
want
him
said
the
women
trying
to
get
the
baby
out
of
the
man
arms
the
lamb
howled
loudly
oh
he
hurt
shrieked
anthea
and
cyril
in
a
savage
undertone
bade
her
stop
it
you
trust
to
me
he
whispered
look
here
he
went
on
he
awfully
tiresome
with
people
he
does
know
very
well
suppose
we
stay
here
a
bit
till
he
gets
used
to
you
and
then
when
it
bedtime
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
we
go
away
and
let
you
keep
him
if
you
want
to
and
then
when
we
gone
you
can
decide
which
of
you
is
to
have
him
as
you
all
want
him
so
much
that
fair
enough
said
the
man
who
was
holding
the
baby
trying
to
loosen
the
red
neckerchief
which
the
lamb
had
caught
hold
of
and
drawn
round
his
mahogany
throat
so
tight
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
the
gipsies
whispered
together
and
cyril
took
the
chance
to
whisper
too
he
said
sunset
we
get
away
then
and
then
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
filled
with
wonder
and
admiration
at
his
having
been
so
clever
as
to
remember
this
oh
do
let
him
come
to
us
said
jane
see
we
sit
down
here
and
take
care
of
him
for
you
till
he
gets
used
to
you
what
about
dinner
said
robert
suddenly
the
others
looked
at
him
with
scorn
fancy
bothering
about
your
beastly
dinner
when
your
br
i
mean
when
the
baby
jane
whispered
hotly
robert
carefully
winked
at
her
and
went
on
you
wo
mind
my
just
running
home
to
get
our
dinner
he
said
to
the
gipsy
i
can
bring
it
out
here
in
a
basket
his
brothers
and
sisters
felt
themselves
very
noble
and
despised
him
they
did
not
know
his
thoughtful
secret
intention
but
the
gipsies
did
in
a
minute
oh
yes
they
said
and
then
fetch
the
police
with
a
pack
of
lies
about
it
being
your
baby
instead
of
ours
catch
a
weasel
asleep
they
asked
if
you
hungry
you
can
pick
a
bit
along
of
us
said
the
not
unkindly
here
levi
that
blessed
kid
howl
all
his
buttons
off
give
him
to
the
little
lady
and
let
see
if
they
get
him
used
to
us
a
bit
so
the
lamb
was
handed
back
but
the
gipsies
crowded
so
closely
that
he
could
not
possibly
stop
howling
then
the
man
with
the
red
handkerchief
said
here
pharaoh
make
up
the
fire
and
you
girls
see
to
the
pot
give
the
kid
a
chanst
so
the
gipsies
very
much
against
their
will
went
off
to
their
work
and
the
children
and
the
lamb
were
left
sitting
on
the
grass
he
be
all
right
at
sunset
jane
whispered
but
oh
it
is
awful
suppose
they
are
frightfully
angry
when
they
come
to
their
senses
they
might
beat
us
or
leave
us
tied
to
trees
or
something
no
they
wo
anthea
said
oh
my
lamb
do
cry
any
more
all
right
panty
got
oo
duckie
they
are
unkind
people
or
they
would
be
going
to
give
us
any
dinner
dinner
said
robert
i
wo
touch
their
nasty
dinner
it
would
choke
me
the
others
thought
so
too
then
but
when
the
dinner
was
ready
it
turned
out
to
be
supper
and
happened
between
four
and
five
they
were
all
glad
enough
to
take
what
they
could
get
it
was
boiled
rabbit
with
onions
and
some
bird
rather
like
a
chicken
but
stringier
about
its
legs
and
with
a
stronger
taste
the
lamb
had
bread
soaked
in
hot
water
and
brown
sugar
sprinkled
on
the
top
he
liked
this
very
much
and
consented
to
let
the
two
gipsy
women
feed
him
with
it
as
he
sat
on
anthea
lap
all
that
long
hot
afternoon
robert
and
cyril
and
anthea
and
jane
had
to
keep
the
lamb
amused
and
happy
while
the
gipsies
looked
eagerly
on
by
the
time
the
shadows
grew
long
and
black
across
the
meadows
he
had
really
taken
to
the
woman
with
the
light
hair
and
even
consented
to
kiss
his
hand
to
the
children
and
to
stand
up
and
bow
with
his
hand
on
his
chest
like
a
gentleman
to
the
two
men
the
whole
gipsy
camp
was
in
raptures
with
him
and
his
brothers
and
sisters
could
not
help
taking
some
pleasure
in
showing
off
his
accomplishments
to
an
audience
so
interested
and
enthusiastic
but
they
longed
for
sunset
illustration
he
consented
to
let
the
two
gypsy
women
feed
him
we
getting
into
the
habit
of
longing
for
sunset
cyril
whispered
how
i
do
wish
we
could
wish
something
really
sensible
that
would
be
of
some
use
so
that
we
should
be
quite
sorry
when
sunset
came
the
shadows
got
longer
and
longer
and
at
last
there
were
no
separate
shadows
any
more
but
one
soft
glowing
shadow
over
everything
for
the
sun
was
out
of
sight
behind
the
hill
but
he
had
not
really
set
yet
the
people
who
make
the
laws
about
lighting
bicycle
lamps
are
the
people
who
decide
when
the
sun
sets
she
has
to
do
it
too
to
the
minute
or
they
would
know
the
reason
why
but
the
gipsies
were
getting
impatient
now
young
uns
the
man
said
it
time
you
were
laying
of
your
heads
on
your
pillowses
so
it
is
the
kid
all
right
and
friendly
with
us
now
so
you
just
hand
him
over
and
get
home
like
you
said
the
women
and
children
came
crowding
round
the
lamb
arms
were
held
out
fingers
snapped
invitingly
friendly
faces
beaming
with
admiring
smiles
but
all
failed
to
tempt
the
loyal
lamb
he
clung
with
arms
and
legs
to
jane
who
happened
to
be
holding
him
and
uttered
the
gloomiest
roar
of
the
whole
day
it
no
good
the
woman
said
hand
the
little
poppet
over
miss
we
soon
quiet
him
and
still
the
sun
would
not
set
tell
her
about
how
to
put
him
to
bed
whispered
cyril
anything
to
gain
time
and
be
ready
to
bolt
when
the
sun
really
does
make
up
its
silly
old
mind
to
set
yes
i
hand
him
over
in
just
one
minute
anthea
began
talking
very
fast
but
do
let
me
just
tell
you
he
has
a
warm
bath
every
night
and
cold
in
the
morning
and
he
has
a
crockery
rabbit
to
go
into
the
warm
bath
with
him
and
little
samuel
saying
his
prayers
in
white
china
on
a
red
cushion
for
the
cold
bath
and
he
hates
you
to
wash
his
ears
but
you
must
and
if
you
let
the
soap
get
into
his
eyes
the
lamb
lamb
kyes
said
he
he
had
stopped
roaring
to
listen
the
woman
laughed
as
if
i
had
never
bath
a
babby
she
said
come
give
us
a
hold
of
him
come
to
my
precious
ugsie
replied
the
lamb
at
once
yes
but
anthea
went
on
about
his
meals
you
really
let
me
tell
you
he
has
an
apple
or
banana
every
morning
and
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
and
an
egg
for
his
tea
sometimes
and
i
brought
up
ten
said
the
black
ringleted
woman
besides
the
others
come
miss
over
i
ca
bear
it
no
longer
i
just
must
give
him
a
hug
we
ai
settled
yet
whose
he
to
be
esther
said
one
of
the
men
it
wo
be
you
esther
with
seven
of
at
your
tail
i
ai
so
sure
of
that
said
esther
husband
and
ai
i
nobody
to
have
a
say
neither
said
the
husband
of
zillah
the
girl
said
an
me
i
a
single
girl
and
no
one
but
to
look
after
i
ought
to
have
him
hold
your
tongue
shut
your
mouth
do
you
show
me
no
more
of
your
imperence
everyone
was
getting
very
angry
the
dark
gipsy
faces
were
frowning
and
suddenly
a
change
swept
over
them
as
if
some
invisible
sponge
had
wiped
away
these
cross
and
anxious
expressions
and
left
only
a
blank
the
children
saw
that
the
sun
really
set
but
they
were
afraid
to
move
and
the
gipsies
were
feeling
so
muddled
because
of
the
invisible
sponge
that
had
washed
all
the
feelings
of
the
last
few
hours
out
of
their
hearts
that
they
could
not
say
a
word
the
children
hardly
dared
to
breathe
suppose
the
gipsies
when
they
recovered
speech
should
be
furious
to
think
how
silly
they
had
been
all
day
it
was
an
awkward
moment
suddenly
anthea
greatly
daring
held
out
the
lamb
to
the
man
here
he
is
she
said
the
man
drew
back
i
should
like
to
deprive
you
miss
he
said
hoarsely
anyone
who
likes
can
have
my
share
of
him
said
the
other
man
after
all
i
got
enough
of
my
own
said
esther
he
a
nice
little
chap
though
said
amelia
she
was
the
only
one
who
now
looked
affectionately
at
the
whimpering
lamb
zillah
said
if
i
do
think
i
must
have
had
a
touch
of
the
sun
do
want
him
then
shall
we
take
him
away
said
anthea
well
suppose
you
do
said
pharaoh
heartily
and
we
say
no
more
about
it
and
with
great
haste
all
the
gipsies
began
to
be
busy
about
their
tents
for
the
night
all
but
amelia
she
went
with
the
children
as
far
as
the
bend
in
the
road
and
there
she
said
let
me
give
him
a
kiss
miss
i
do
know
what
made
us
go
for
to
behave
so
silly
us
gipsies
do
steal
babies
whatever
they
may
tell
you
when
you
naughty
we
enough
of
our
own
mostly
but
i
lost
all
mine
she
leaned
towards
the
lamb
and
he
looking
in
her
eyes
unexpectedly
put
up
a
grubby
soft
paw
and
stroked
her
face
poor
poor
said
the
lamb
and
he
let
the
gipsy
woman
kiss
him
and
what
is
more
he
kissed
her
brown
cheek
in
return
a
very
nice
kiss
as
all
his
kisses
are
and
not
a
wet
one
like
some
babies
give
the
gipsy
woman
moved
her
finger
about
on
his
forehead
as
if
she
had
been
writing
something
there
and
the
same
with
his
chest
and
his
hands
and
his
feet
then
she
said
may
he
be
brave
and
have
the
strong
head
to
think
with
and
the
strong
heart
to
love
with
and
the
strong
arms
to
work
with
and
the
strong
feet
to
travel
with
and
always
come
safe
home
to
his
own
then
she
said
something
in
a
strange
language
no
one
could
understand
and
suddenly
added
well
i
must
be
saying
long
and
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
and
she
turned
and
went
back
to
her
home
the
tent
by
the
grassy
roadside
the
children
looked
after
her
till
she
was
out
of
sight
then
robert
said
how
silly
of
her
even
sunset
did
put
right
what
rot
she
talked
well
said
cyril
if
you
ask
me
i
think
it
was
rather
decent
of
her
decent
said
anthea
it
was
very
nice
indeed
of
her
i
think
she
a
dear
she
just
too
frightfully
nice
for
anything
said
jane
and
they
went
home
very
late
for
tea
and
unspeakably
late
for
dinner
martha
scolded
of
course
but
the
lamb
was
safe
i
say
it
turned
out
we
wanted
the
lamb
as
much
as
anyone
said
robert
later
of
course
but
do
you
feel
different
about
it
now
the
sun
set
said
all
the
others
together
then
it
lasted
over
sunset
with
us
no
it
has
cyril
explained
the
wish
did
do
anything
to
we
always
wanted
him
with
all
our
hearts
when
we
were
our
proper
selves
only
we
were
all
pigs
this
morning
especially
you
robert
robert
bore
this
much
with
a
strange
calm
i
certainly
i
did
want
him
this
morning
said
he
perhaps
i
a
pig
but
everything
looked
so
different
when
we
thought
we
were
going
to
lose
him
and
that
my
dear
children
is
the
moral
of
this
chapter
i
did
not
mean
it
to
have
a
moral
but
morals
are
nasty
forward
beings
and
will
keep
putting
in
their
oars
where
they
are
not
wanted
and
since
the
moral
has
crept
in
quite
against
my
wishes
you
might
as
well
think
of
it
next
time
you
feel
piggy
yourself
and
want
to
get
rid
of
any
of
your
brothers
and
sisters
i
hope
this
does
often
happen
but
i
daresay
it
has
happened
sometimes
even
to
you
chapter
iv
wings
the
next
day
was
very
wet
too
wet
to
go
out
and
far
too
wet
to
think
of
disturbing
a
so
sensitive
to
water
that
he
still
after
thousands
of
years
felt
the
pain
of
once
having
his
left
whisker
wetted
it
was
a
long
day
and
it
was
not
till
the
afternoon
that
all
the
children
suddenly
decided
to
write
letters
to
their
mother
it
was
robert
who
had
the
misfortune
to
upset
the
ink
well
an
unusually
deep
and
full
one
straight
into
that
part
of
anthea
desk
where
she
had
long
pretended
that
an
arrangement
of
mucilage
and
cardboard
painted
with
indian
ink
was
a
secret
drawer
it
was
not
exactly
robert
fault
it
was
only
his
misfortune
that
he
chanced
to
be
lifting
the
ink
across
the
desk
just
at
the
moment
when
anthea
had
got
it
open
and
that
that
same
moment
should
have
been
the
one
chosen
by
the
lamb
to
get
under
the
table
and
break
his
squeaking
bird
there
was
a
sharp
convenient
wire
inside
the
bird
and
of
course
the
lamb
ran
the
wire
into
leg
at
once
and
so
without
anyone
meaning
to
do
it
the
secret
drawer
was
flooded
with
ink
at
the
same
time
a
stream
was
poured
over
letter
so
that
her
letter
was
something
like
this
darling
mother
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
and
i
hope
granny
is
better
the
other
day
we
then
came
a
flood
of
ink
and
at
the
bottom
these
words
in
pencil
it
was
not
me
upset
the
ink
but
it
took
such
a
time
clearing
up
so
no
more
as
it
is
from
your
loving
daughter
anthea
robert
letter
had
not
even
been
begun
he
had
been
drawing
a
ship
on
the
blotting
paper
while
he
was
trying
to
think
of
what
to
say
and
of
course
after
the
ink
was
upset
he
had
to
help
anthea
to
clean
out
her
desk
and
he
promised
to
make
her
another
secret
drawer
better
than
the
other
and
she
said
well
make
it
now
so
it
was
and
his
letter
was
done
and
the
secret
drawer
was
done
either
cyril
wrote
a
long
letter
very
fast
and
then
went
to
set
a
trap
for
slugs
that
he
had
read
about
in
the
and
when
it
was
the
letter
could
not
be
found
and
it
was
never
found
perhaps
the
slugs
ate
it
jane
letter
was
the
only
one
that
went
she
meant
to
tell
her
mother
all
about
the
psammead
in
fact
they
had
all
meant
to
do
this
but
she
spent
so
long
thinking
how
to
spell
the
word
that
there
was
no
time
to
tell
the
story
properly
and
it
is
useless
to
tell
a
story
unless
you
tell
it
properly
so
she
had
to
be
contented
with
this
my
dear
mother
dear
we
are
all
as
good
as
we
can
like
you
told
us
to
and
the
lamb
has
a
little
cold
but
martha
says
it
is
nothing
only
he
upset
the
into
himself
yesterday
morning
when
we
were
up
at
the
the
other
day
we
went
round
by
the
safe
way
where
carts
go
and
we
found
a
half
an
hour
went
by
before
jane
felt
quite
sure
that
they
could
none
of
them
spell
psammead
and
they
could
not
find
it
in
the
dictionary
either
though
they
looked
then
jane
hastily
finished
her
letter
we
found
a
strange
thing
but
it
is
nearly
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
little
girl
jane
if
you
could
have
a
wish
come
true
what
would
you
have
then
the
postman
was
heard
blowing
his
horn
and
robert
rushed
out
in
the
rain
to
stop
his
cart
and
give
him
the
letters
and
that
was
how
it
happened
that
though
all
the
children
meant
to
tell
their
mother
about
the
somehow
or
other
she
never
got
to
know
there
were
other
reasons
why
she
never
got
to
know
but
these
come
later
the
next
day
uncle
richard
came
and
took
them
all
to
maidstone
in
a
wagonette
all
except
the
lamb
uncle
richard
was
the
very
best
kind
of
uncle
he
bought
them
toys
at
maidstone
he
took
them
into
a
shop
and
let
them
all
choose
exactly
what
they
wanted
without
any
restrictions
about
price
and
no
nonsense
about
things
being
instructive
it
is
very
wise
to
let
children
choose
exactly
what
they
like
because
they
are
very
foolish
and
inexperienced
and
sometimes
they
will
choose
a
really
instructive
thing
without
meaning
to
do
so
this
happened
to
robert
who
chose
at
the
last
moment
and
in
a
great
hurry
a
box
with
pictures
on
it
of
winged
bulls
with
men
heads
and
winged
men
with
eagles
heads
he
thought
there
would
be
animals
inside
the
same
as
on
the
box
when
he
got
it
home
it
was
a
sunday
puzzle
about
ancient
nineveh
the
others
chose
in
haste
and
were
happy
at
leisure
cyril
had
a
model
engine
and
the
girls
had
two
dolls
as
well
as
a
china
with
on
it
to
be
between
them
the
boys
between
them
was
bow
and
arrow
then
uncle
richard
took
them
on
the
beautiful
medway
in
a
boat
and
then
they
all
had
tea
at
a
beautiful
confectioner
and
when
they
reached
home
it
was
far
too
late
to
have
any
wishes
that
day
they
did
not
tell
uncle
richard
anything
about
the
psammead
i
do
not
know
why
and
they
do
not
know
why
but
i
daresay
you
can
guess
the
day
after
uncle
richard
had
behaved
so
handsomely
was
a
very
hot
day
indeed
the
people
who
decide
what
the
weather
is
to
be
and
put
its
orders
down
for
it
in
the
newspapers
every
morning
said
afterwards
that
it
was
the
hottest
day
there
had
been
for
years
they
had
ordered
it
to
be
warmer
some
showers
and
warmer
it
certainly
was
in
fact
it
was
so
busy
being
warmer
that
it
had
no
time
to
attend
to
the
order
about
showers
so
there
were
any
have
you
ever
been
up
at
five
on
a
fine
summer
morning
it
is
very
beautiful
the
sunlight
is
pinky
and
yellowy
and
all
the
grass
and
trees
are
covered
with
and
all
the
shadows
go
the
opposite
way
to
the
way
they
do
in
the
evening
which
is
very
interesting
and
makes
you
feel
as
though
you
were
in
a
new
other
world
anthea
woke
at
five
she
had
made
herself
wake
and
i
must
tell
you
how
it
is
done
even
if
it
keeps
you
waiting
for
the
story
to
go
on
you
get
into
bed
at
night
and
lie
down
quite
flat
on
your
little
back
with
your
hands
straight
down
by
your
sides
then
you
say
i
wake
up
at
five
or
six
or
seven
or
eight
or
nine
or
whatever
the
time
is
that
you
want
and
as
you
say
it
you
push
your
chin
down
on
your
chest
and
then
whack
your
head
back
on
the
pillow
and
you
do
this
as
many
times
as
there
are
ones
in
the
time
you
want
to
wake
up
at
it
is
quite
an
easy
sum
of
course
everything
depends
on
your
really
wanting
to
get
up
at
five
or
six
or
seven
or
eight
or
nine
if
you
really
want
to
it
all
of
no
use
but
if
you
do
well
try
it
and
see
of
course
in
this
as
in
doing
latin
proses
or
getting
into
mischief
practice
makes
perfect
anthea
was
quite
perfect
at
the
very
moment
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
heard
the
clock
down
in
the
strike
eleven
so
she
knew
it
was
three
minutes
to
five
the
clock
always
struck
wrong
but
it
was
all
right
when
you
knew
what
it
meant
it
was
like
a
person
talking
a
foreign
language
if
you
know
the
language
it
is
just
as
easy
to
understand
as
english
and
anthea
knew
the
clock
language
she
was
very
sleepy
but
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
put
her
face
and
hands
into
a
basin
of
cold
water
this
is
a
fairy
charm
that
prevents
your
wanting
to
get
back
into
bed
again
then
she
dressed
and
folded
up
her
night
dress
she
did
not
tumble
it
together
by
the
sleeves
but
folded
it
by
the
seams
from
the
hem
and
that
will
show
you
the
kind
of
little
girl
she
was
then
she
took
her
shoes
in
her
hand
and
crept
softly
down
the
stairs
she
opened
the
window
and
climbed
out
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
to
go
out
by
the
door
but
the
window
was
more
romantic
and
less
likely
to
be
noticed
by
martha
i
will
always
get
up
at
five
she
said
to
herself
it
was
quite
too
awfully
pretty
for
anything
her
heart
was
beating
very
fast
for
she
was
carrying
out
a
plan
quite
her
own
she
could
not
be
sure
that
it
was
a
good
plan
but
she
was
quite
sure
that
it
would
not
be
any
better
if
she
were
to
tell
the
others
about
it
and
she
had
a
feeling
that
right
or
wrong
she
would
rather
go
through
with
it
alone
she
put
on
her
shoes
under
the
iron
verandah
on
the
shining
tiles
and
then
she
ran
straight
to
the
and
found
the
psammead
place
and
dug
it
out
it
was
very
cross
indeed
it
too
bad
it
said
fluffing
up
its
fur
as
pigeons
do
their
feathers
at
christmas
time
the
weather
arctic
and
it
the
middle
of
the
night
i
so
sorry
said
anthea
gently
and
she
took
off
her
white
pinafore
and
covered
the
up
with
it
all
but
its
head
its
bat
ears
and
its
eyes
that
were
like
a
snail
eyes
thank
you
it
said
that
better
what
the
wish
this
morning
i
do
know
she
said
that
just
it
you
see
we
been
very
unlucky
so
far
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
but
would
you
mind
not
giving
me
any
wishes
till
after
breakfast
it
so
hard
to
talk
to
anyone
if
they
jump
out
at
you
with
wishes
you
do
really
want
you
should
say
you
wish
for
things
if
you
do
wish
for
them
in
the
old
days
people
almost
always
knew
whether
it
was
megatherium
or
ichthyosaurus
they
really
wanted
for
dinner
i
try
not
to
do
so
said
anthea
but
i
do
wish
look
out
said
the
psammead
in
a
warning
voice
and
it
began
to
blow
itself
out
oh
this
is
a
magic
wish
it
just
i
should
be
so
glad
if
not
swell
yourself
out
and
nearly
burst
to
give
me
anything
just
now
wait
till
the
others
are
here
well
well
it
said
indulgently
but
it
shivered
would
you
asked
anthea
kindly
would
you
like
to
come
and
sit
on
my
lap
you
be
warmer
and
i
could
turn
the
skirt
of
my
frock
up
around
you
i
be
very
careful
anthea
had
never
expected
that
it
would
but
it
did
thank
you
it
said
you
really
are
rather
thoughtful
it
crept
on
to
her
lap
and
snuggled
down
and
she
put
her
arms
round
it
with
a
rather
frightened
gentleness
now
then
it
said
well
then
said
anthea
everything
we
have
wished
has
turned
out
rather
horrid
i
wish
you
would
advise
us
you
are
so
old
you
must
be
very
wise
i
was
always
generous
from
a
child
said
the
i
spent
the
whole
of
my
waking
hours
in
giving
but
one
thing
i
give
that
advice
you
see
anthea
went
on
it
such
a
wonderful
thing
such
a
splendid
glorious
chance
it
so
good
and
kind
and
dear
of
you
to
give
us
our
wishes
and
it
seems
such
a
pity
it
should
all
be
wasted
just
because
we
are
too
silly
to
know
what
to
wish
for
anthea
had
meant
to
say
that
and
she
had
not
wanted
to
say
it
before
the
others
it
one
thing
to
say
you
silly
and
quite
another
to
say
that
other
people
are
child
said
the
sleepily
i
can
only
advise
you
to
think
before
you
speak
but
i
thought
you
never
gave
advice
that
piece
does
count
it
said
you
never
take
it
besides
it
not
original
it
in
all
the
but
wo
you
just
say
if
you
think
wings
would
be
a
silly
wish
wings
it
said
i
should
think
you
might
do
worse
only
take
care
you
are
flying
high
at
sunset
there
was
a
little
ninevite
boy
i
heard
of
once
he
was
one
of
king
sennacherib
sons
and
a
traveller
brought
him
a
psammead
he
used
to
keep
it
in
a
box
of
sand
on
the
palace
terrace
it
was
a
dreadful
degradation
for
one
of
us
of
course
still
the
boy
the
assyrian
king
son
and
one
day
he
wished
for
wings
and
got
them
but
he
forgot
that
they
would
turn
into
stone
at
sunset
and
when
they
did
he
fell
on
to
one
of
the
winged
lions
at
the
top
of
his
father
great
staircase
and
what
with
stone
wings
and
the
lion
stone
wings
well
it
not
a
very
pretty
story
but
i
believe
the
boy
enjoyed
himself
very
much
till
then
tell
me
said
anthea
why
do
our
wishes
turn
into
stone
now
why
do
they
just
vanish
temps
autres
said
the
creature
is
that
the
ninevite
language
asked
anthea
who
had
learned
no
foreign
language
at
school
except
french
what
i
mean
is
the
psammead
went
on
that
in
the
old
days
people
wished
for
good
solid
everyday
gifts
mammoths
and
pterodactyls
and
things
and
those
could
be
turned
into
stone
as
easy
as
not
but
people
wish
such
fanciful
things
nowadays
how
are
you
going
to
turn
being
beautiful
as
the
day
or
being
wanted
by
everybody
into
stone
you
see
it
ca
be
done
and
it
would
never
do
to
have
two
rules
so
they
simply
vanish
if
being
beautiful
as
the
day
be
turned
into
stone
it
would
last
an
awfully
long
time
you
know
much
longer
than
you
would
just
look
at
the
greek
statues
it
just
as
well
as
it
is
i
so
sleepy
it
jumped
off
her
lap
dug
frantically
and
vanished
anthea
was
late
for
breakfast
it
was
robert
who
quietly
poured
a
spoonful
of
molasses
down
the
lamb
frock
so
that
he
had
to
be
taken
away
and
washed
thoroughly
directly
after
breakfast
and
it
was
of
course
a
very
naughty
thing
to
do
yet
it
served
two
purposes
it
delighted
the
lamb
who
loved
above
all
things
to
be
completely
sticky
and
it
engaged
martha
attention
so
that
the
others
could
slip
away
to
the
without
the
lamb
they
did
it
and
in
the
lane
anthea
breathless
from
the
hurry
of
that
slipping
panted
out
i
want
to
propose
we
take
turns
to
wish
only
nobody
to
have
a
wish
if
the
others
do
think
it
a
nice
wish
do
you
agree
who
to
have
first
wish
asked
robert
cautiously
me
if
you
do
mind
said
anthea
apologetically
and
i
thought
about
it
and
it
there
was
a
silence
the
others
rather
wanted
to
find
fault
but
it
was
hard
because
the
word
wings
raised
a
flutter
of
joyous
excitement
in
every
breast
not
so
dusty
said
cyril
generously
and
robert
added
really
panther
you
not
quite
such
a
fool
as
you
look
jane
said
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
lovely
it
like
a
bright
dream
of
delirium
they
found
the
easily
anthea
said
i
wish
we
all
had
beautiful
wings
to
fly
with
the
blew
himself
out
and
next
moment
each
child
felt
a
funny
feeling
half
heaviness
and
half
lightness
on
its
shoulders
the
psammead
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
turned
its
snail
eyes
from
one
side
to
the
other
illustration
the
blew
himself
out
not
so
bad
it
said
dreamily
but
really
robert
you
not
quite
such
an
angel
as
you
look
robert
almost
blushed
the
wings
were
very
big
and
more
beautiful
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
for
they
were
soft
and
smooth
and
every
feather
lay
neatly
in
its
place
and
the
feathers
were
of
the
most
lovely
mixed
changing
colors
like
the
rainbow
or
iridescent
glass
or
the
beautiful
scum
that
sometimes
floats
on
water
that
is
not
at
all
nice
to
drink
oh
but
how
can
we
fly
jane
said
standing
anxiously
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
look
out
said
cyril
you
treading
on
my
wing
does
it
hurt
asked
anthea
with
interest
but
no
one
answered
for
robert
had
spread
his
wings
and
jumped
up
and
now
he
was
slowly
rising
in
the
air
he
looked
very
awkward
in
his
knickerbocker
suit
his
boots
in
particular
hung
helplessly
and
seemed
much
larger
than
when
he
was
standing
in
them
but
the
others
cared
but
little
how
he
looked
or
how
they
looked
for
that
matter
for
now
they
all
spread
out
their
wings
and
rose
in
the
air
of
course
you
all
know
what
flying
feels
like
because
everyone
has
dreamed
about
flying
and
is
seems
so
beautifully
easy
only
you
can
never
remember
how
you
did
it
and
as
a
rule
you
have
to
do
it
without
wings
in
your
dreams
which
is
more
clever
and
uncommon
but
not
so
easy
to
remember
the
rule
for
now
the
four
children
rose
flapping
from
the
ground
and
you
ca
think
how
good
the
air
felt
as
it
ran
against
their
faces
their
wings
were
tremendously
wide
when
they
were
spread
out
and
they
had
to
fly
quite
a
long
way
apart
so
as
not
to
get
in
each
other
way
but
little
things
like
this
are
easily
learned
all
the
words
in
the
english
dictionary
and
in
the
greek
lexicon
as
well
are
i
find
of
no
use
at
all
to
tell
you
exactly
what
it
feels
like
to
be
flying
so
i
will
not
try
but
i
will
say
that
to
look
on
the
fields
and
woods
instead
of
at
them
is
something
like
looking
at
a
beautiful
live
map
where
instead
of
silly
colors
on
paper
you
have
real
moving
sunny
woods
and
green
fields
laid
out
one
after
the
other
as
cyril
said
and
i
ca
think
where
he
got
hold
of
such
a
strange
expression
it
does
you
a
fair
treat
it
was
most
wonderful
and
more
like
real
magic
than
any
wish
the
children
had
had
yet
they
flapped
and
flew
and
sailed
on
their
great
rainbow
wings
between
green
earth
and
blue
sky
and
they
flew
over
rochester
and
then
swerved
round
towards
maidstone
and
presently
they
all
began
to
feel
extremely
hungry
curiously
enough
this
happened
when
they
were
flying
rather
low
and
just
as
they
were
crossing
an
orchard
where
some
early
plums
shone
red
and
ripe
illustration
they
flew
over
rochester
they
paused
on
their
wings
i
can
not
explain
to
you
how
this
is
done
but
it
is
something
like
treading
water
when
you
are
swimming
and
hawks
do
it
extremely
well
yes
i
daresay
said
cyril
though
no
one
had
spoken
but
stealing
is
stealing
even
if
you
got
wings
do
you
really
think
so
said
jane
briskly
if
you
got
wings
a
bird
and
no
one
minds
birds
breaking
the
commandments
at
least
they
may
but
the
birds
always
do
it
and
no
one
scolds
them
or
sends
them
to
prison
it
was
not
so
easy
to
perch
on
a
as
you
might
think
because
the
rainbow
wings
were
so
large
but
somehow
they
all
managed
to
do
it
and
the
plums
were
certainly
very
sweet
and
juicy
fortunately
it
was
not
till
they
had
all
had
quite
as
many
plums
as
were
good
for
them
that
they
saw
a
stout
man
who
looked
exactly
as
though
he
owned
the
come
hurrying
through
the
orchard
gate
with
a
thick
stick
and
with
one
accord
they
disentangled
their
wings
from
the
branches
and
began
to
fly
the
man
stopped
short
with
his
mouth
open
for
he
had
seen
the
boughs
of
his
trees
moving
and
twitching
and
he
had
said
to
himself
them
young
varmint
at
it
again
and
he
had
come
out
at
once
for
the
lads
of
the
village
had
taught
him
in
past
seasons
that
plums
want
looking
after
but
when
he
saw
the
rainbow
wings
flutter
up
out
of
the
he
felt
that
he
must
have
gone
quite
mad
and
he
did
not
like
the
feeling
at
all
and
when
anthea
looked
down
and
saw
his
mouth
go
slowly
open
and
stay
so
and
his
face
become
green
and
mauve
in
patches
she
called
out
do
be
frightened
and
felt
hastily
in
her
pocket
for
a
with
a
hole
in
it
which
she
had
meant
to
hang
on
a
ribbon
round
her
neck
for
luck
she
hovered
round
the
unfortunate
and
said
we
have
had
some
of
your
plums
we
thought
it
was
stealing
but
now
i
am
not
so
sure
so
here
some
money
to
pay
for
them
she
swooped
down
toward
the
grower
of
plums
and
slipped
the
coin
into
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
in
a
few
flaps
she
had
rejoined
the
others
the
farmer
sat
down
on
the
grass
suddenly
and
heavily
illustration
the
farmer
sat
down
on
the
grass
suddenly
and
heavily
well
i
blessed
he
said
this
here
is
what
they
call
delusions
i
suppose
but
this
here
threepenny
he
had
pulled
it
out
and
bitten
it
real
enough
well
from
this
day
forth
i
be
a
better
man
it
the
kind
of
thing
to
sober
a
chap
for
life
this
is
i
glad
it
was
only
wings
though
i
rather
see
the
birds
as
are
there
and
could
be
even
if
they
pretend
to
talk
than
some
things
as
i
could
name
he
got
up
slowly
and
heavily
and
went
indoors
and
he
was
so
nice
to
his
wife
that
day
that
she
felt
quite
happy
and
said
to
herself
law
whatever
have
to
the
man
and
smartened
herself
up
and
put
a
blue
ribbon
bow
at
the
place
where
her
collar
fastened
on
and
looked
so
pretty
that
he
was
kinder
than
ever
so
perhaps
the
winged
children
really
did
do
one
good
thing
that
day
if
so
it
was
the
only
one
for
really
there
is
nothing
like
wings
for
getting
you
into
trouble
but
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
in
trouble
there
is
nothing
like
wings
for
getting
you
out
of
it
this
was
the
case
in
the
matter
of
the
fierce
dog
who
sprang
out
at
them
when
they
had
folded
up
their
wings
as
small
as
possible
and
were
going
up
to
a
farm
door
to
ask
for
a
crust
of
bread
and
cheese
for
in
spite
of
the
plums
they
were
soon
just
as
hungry
as
ever
again
now
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
the
four
had
been
ordinary
wingless
children
that
black
and
fierce
dog
would
have
had
a
good
bite
out
of
the
leg
of
robert
who
was
the
nearest
but
at
its
first
growl
there
was
a
flutter
of
wings
and
the
dog
was
left
to
strain
at
his
chain
and
stand
on
his
as
if
he
were
trying
to
fly
too
they
tried
several
other
farms
but
at
those
where
there
were
no
dogs
the
people
were
far
too
frightened
to
do
anything
but
scream
and
at
last
when
it
was
nearly
four
and
their
wings
were
getting
miserably
stiff
and
tired
they
alighted
on
a
and
held
a
council
of
war
we
ca
possibly
fly
all
the
way
home
without
dinner
tea
said
robert
with
desperate
decision
and
nobody
will
give
us
any
dinner
or
even
lunch
let
alone
tea
said
cyril
perhaps
the
clergyman
here
might
suggested
anthea
he
must
know
all
about
angels
anybody
could
see
we
not
that
said
jane
look
at
robert
boots
and
squirrel
plaid
necktie
well
said
cyril
firmly
if
the
country
you
in
wo
provisions
you
them
in
wars
i
mean
i
quite
certain
you
do
and
even
in
other
stories
no
good
brother
would
allow
his
little
sisters
to
starve
in
the
midst
of
plenty
plenty
repeated
robert
hungrily
and
the
others
looked
vaguely
round
the
bare
leads
of
the
and
murmured
in
the
midst
of
yes
said
cyril
impressively
there
is
a
larder
window
at
the
side
of
the
clergyman
house
and
i
saw
things
to
eat
inside
custard
pudding
and
cold
chicken
and
tongue
and
pies
and
jam
it
rather
a
high
window
but
with
wings
how
clever
of
you
said
jane
not
at
all
said
cyril
modestly
any
born
general
napoleon
or
the
duke
of
marlborough
would
have
seen
it
just
the
same
as
i
did
it
seems
very
wrong
said
anthea
nonsense
said
cyril
what
was
it
sir
philip
sidney
said
when
the
soldier
would
give
him
a
drink
necessity
is
greater
than
his
we
club
together
our
money
though
and
leave
it
to
pay
for
the
things
wo
we
anthea
was
persuasive
and
very
nearly
in
tears
because
it
is
most
trying
to
feel
enormously
hungry
and
unspeakably
sinful
at
one
and
the
same
time
some
of
it
was
the
cautious
reply
everyone
now
turned
out
its
pockets
on
the
lead
roof
of
the
tower
where
visitors
for
the
last
hundred
and
fifty
years
had
cut
their
own
and
their
sweethearts
initials
with
penknives
in
the
soft
lead
there
was
halfpenny
altogether
and
even
the
upright
anthea
admitted
that
that
was
too
much
to
pay
for
four
people
dinners
robert
said
he
thought
eighteenpence
illustration
every
one
now
turned
out
his
pockets
and
was
finally
agreed
to
be
handsome
so
anthea
wrote
on
the
back
of
her
last
term
report
which
happened
to
be
in
her
pocket
and
from
which
she
first
tore
her
own
name
and
that
of
the
school
the
following
letter
dear
reverend
clergyman
we
are
very
hungry
indeed
because
of
having
to
fly
all
day
and
we
think
it
is
not
stealing
when
you
are
starving
to
death
we
are
afraid
to
ask
you
for
fear
you
should
say
because
of
course
you
know
about
angels
but
you
would
not
think
we
were
angels
we
will
only
take
the
necessities
of
life
and
no
pudding
or
pie
to
show
you
it
is
not
grediness
but
true
starvation
that
makes
us
make
your
larder
stand
and
deliver
but
we
are
not
highwaymen
by
trade
cut
it
short
said
the
others
with
one
accord
and
anthea
hastily
added
our
intentions
are
quite
honourable
if
you
only
knew
and
here
is
to
show
we
are
sinseer
and
grateful
thank
you
for
your
kind
hospitality
from
us
four
the
was
wrapped
in
this
letter
and
all
the
children
felt
that
when
the
clergyman
had
read
it
he
would
understand
everything
as
well
as
anyone
could
who
had
not
even
seen
the
wings
now
said
cyril
of
course
there
some
risk
we
better
fly
straight
down
the
other
side
of
the
tower
and
then
flutter
low
across
the
churchyard
and
in
through
the
shrubbery
there
does
seem
to
be
anyone
about
but
you
never
know
the
window
looks
out
into
the
shrubbery
it
is
embowered
in
foliage
like
a
window
in
a
story
i
go
in
and
get
the
things
robert
and
anthea
can
take
them
as
i
hand
them
out
through
the
window
and
jane
can
keep
watch
her
eyes
are
sharp
and
whistle
if
she
sees
anyone
about
shut
up
robert
she
can
whistle
quite
well
enough
for
that
anyway
it
ought
not
to
be
a
very
good
whistle
it
sound
more
natural
and
birdlike
now
then
off
we
go
i
can
not
pretend
that
stealing
is
right
i
can
only
say
that
on
this
occasion
it
did
not
look
like
stealing
to
the
hungry
four
but
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
fair
and
reasonable
business
transaction
they
had
never
happened
to
learn
that
a
tongue
hardly
cut
into
a
chicken
and
a
half
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
syphon
of
can
not
be
bought
in
the
stores
for
these
were
the
necessaries
of
life
which
cyril
handed
out
of
the
larder
window
when
quite
unobserved
and
without
hindrance
or
adventure
he
had
led
the
others
to
that
happy
spot
he
felt
that
to
refrain
from
jam
apple
pie
cake
and
mixed
candied
peel
was
a
really
heroic
act
and
i
agree
with
him
he
was
also
proud
of
not
taking
the
custard
pudding
and
there
i
think
he
was
wrong
because
if
he
had
taken
it
there
would
have
been
a
difficulty
about
returning
the
dish
no
one
however
starving
has
a
right
to
steal
china
with
little
pink
flowers
on
them
the
syphon
was
different
they
could
not
do
without
something
to
drink
and
as
the
maker
name
was
on
it
they
felt
sure
it
would
be
returned
to
him
wherever
they
might
leave
it
if
they
had
time
they
would
take
it
back
themselves
the
man
appeared
to
live
in
rochester
which
would
not
be
much
out
of
their
way
home
illustration
these
were
the
necessaries
of
life
everything
was
carried
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
laid
down
on
a
sheet
of
kitchen
paper
which
cyril
had
found
on
the
top
shelf
of
the
larder
as
he
unfolded
it
anthea
said
i
do
think
a
necessity
of
life
yes
it
is
said
he
we
must
put
the
things
down
somewhere
to
cut
them
up
and
i
heard
father
say
the
other
day
people
got
diseases
from
germans
in
now
there
must
be
lots
of
here
and
when
it
dries
up
the
germans
are
left
and
they
get
into
the
things
and
we
should
all
die
of
scarlet
fever
what
are
germans
little
waggly
things
you
see
with
microscopes
said
cyril
with
a
scientific
air
they
give
you
every
illness
you
can
think
of
i
sure
the
paper
was
a
necessary
just
as
much
as
the
bread
and
meat
and
water
now
then
oh
i
hungry
i
do
not
wish
to
describe
the
picnic
party
on
the
top
of
the
tower
you
can
imagine
well
enough
what
it
is
like
to
carve
a
chicken
and
a
tongue
with
a
knife
that
has
only
one
blade
and
that
snapped
off
short
about
down
but
it
was
done
eating
with
your
fingers
is
greasy
and
difficult
and
paper
dishes
soon
get
to
look
very
spotty
and
horrid
but
one
thing
you
imagine
and
that
is
how
behaves
when
you
try
to
drink
it
straight
out
of
a
syphon
especially
a
quite
full
one
but
if
imagination
will
not
help
you
experience
will
and
you
can
easily
try
it
for
yourself
if
you
can
get
a
to
give
you
the
syphon
if
you
want
to
have
a
really
thorough
experience
put
the
tube
in
your
mouth
and
press
the
handle
very
suddenly
and
very
hard
you
had
better
do
it
when
you
are
alone
and
out
of
doors
is
best
for
this
experiment
however
you
eat
them
tongue
and
chicken
and
new
bread
are
very
good
things
and
no
one
minds
being
sprinkled
a
little
with
on
a
really
fine
hot
day
so
that
everyone
enjoyed
the
dinner
very
much
indeed
and
everyone
ate
as
much
as
it
possibly
could
first
because
it
was
extremely
hungry
and
secondly
because
as
i
said
tongue
and
chicken
and
new
bread
are
very
nice
now
i
daresay
you
will
have
noticed
that
if
you
have
to
wait
for
your
dinner
till
long
after
the
proper
time
and
then
eat
a
great
deal
more
dinner
than
usual
and
sit
in
the
hot
sun
on
the
top
of
a
or
even
anywhere
else
you
become
soon
and
strangely
sleepy
now
anthea
and
jane
and
cyril
and
robert
were
very
like
you
in
many
ways
and
when
they
had
eaten
all
they
could
and
drunk
all
there
was
they
became
sleepy
strangely
and
soon
especially
anthea
because
she
had
gotten
up
so
early
illustration
the
children
were
fast
asleep
one
by
one
they
left
off
talking
and
leaned
back
and
before
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
dinner
they
had
all
curled
round
and
tucked
themselves
up
under
their
large
soft
warm
wings
and
were
fast
asleep
and
the
sun
was
sinking
slowly
in
the
west
i
must
say
it
was
in
the
west
because
it
is
usual
in
books
to
say
so
for
fear
careless
people
should
think
it
was
setting
in
the
east
in
point
of
fact
it
was
not
exactly
in
the
west
either
but
that
near
enough
the
sun
i
repeat
was
sinking
slowly
in
the
west
and
the
children
slept
warmly
and
happily
on
for
wings
are
cosier
than
quilts
to
sleep
under
the
shadow
of
the
fell
across
the
churchyard
and
across
the
vicarage
and
across
the
field
beyond
and
presently
there
were
no
more
shadows
and
the
sun
had
set
and
the
wings
were
gone
and
still
the
children
slept
but
not
for
long
twilight
is
very
beautiful
but
it
is
chilly
and
you
know
however
sleepy
you
are
you
wake
up
soon
enough
if
your
brother
or
sister
happens
to
be
up
first
and
pulls
your
blankets
off
you
the
four
wingless
children
shivered
and
woke
and
there
they
were
on
the
top
of
a
in
the
dusky
twilight
with
blue
stars
coming
out
by
ones
and
twos
and
tens
and
twenties
over
their
heads
miles
away
from
home
with
three
shillings
and
in
their
pockets
and
a
doubtful
act
about
the
necessities
of
life
to
be
accounted
for
if
anyone
found
them
with
the
syphon
they
looked
at
each
other
cyril
spoke
first
picking
up
the
syphon
we
better
get
along
down
and
get
rid
of
this
beastly
thing
it
dark
enough
to
leave
it
on
the
clergyman
doorstep
i
should
think
come
on
there
was
a
little
turret
at
the
corner
of
the
tower
and
the
little
turret
had
a
door
in
it
they
had
noticed
this
when
they
were
eating
but
had
not
explored
it
as
you
would
have
done
in
their
place
because
of
course
when
you
have
wings
and
can
explore
the
whole
sky
doors
seem
hardly
worth
exploring
now
they
turned
towards
it
of
course
said
cyril
this
is
the
way
down
it
was
but
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
and
the
world
was
growing
darker
and
darker
and
they
were
miles
from
home
and
there
was
the
syphon
i
shall
not
tell
you
whether
anyone
cried
nor
if
so
how
many
cried
nor
who
cried
you
will
be
better
employed
in
making
up
your
minds
what
you
would
have
done
if
you
had
been
in
their
place
chapter
v
no
wings
whether
anyone
cried
or
not
there
was
certainly
an
interval
during
which
none
of
the
party
was
quite
itself
when
they
grew
calmer
anthea
put
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
and
her
arm
round
jane
and
said
it
ca
be
for
more
than
one
night
we
can
signal
with
our
handkerchiefs
in
the
morning
they
be
dry
then
and
someone
will
come
up
and
let
us
out
and
find
the
syphon
said
cyril
gloomily
and
we
shall
be
sent
to
prison
for
stealing
you
said
it
was
stealing
you
said
you
were
sure
it
was
i
not
sure
said
cyril
shortly
let
throw
the
thing
away
among
the
trees
said
robert
then
no
one
can
do
anything
to
us
oh
yes
cyril
laugh
was
not
a
one
and
hit
some
chap
on
the
head
and
be
murderers
as
well
as
as
the
other
thing
but
we
ca
stay
up
here
all
night
said
jane
and
i
want
my
tea
you
want
your
tea
said
robert
you
only
just
had
your
dinner
but
i
want
it
she
said
especially
when
you
begin
talking
about
stopping
up
here
all
night
oh
panther
i
want
to
go
home
i
want
to
go
home
hush
hush
anthea
said
do
dear
it
be
all
right
somehow
do
do
let
her
cry
said
robert
desperately
if
she
howls
loud
enough
someone
may
hear
and
come
and
let
us
out
and
see
the
thing
said
anthea
swiftly
robert
do
be
a
brute
oh
jane
do
try
to
be
a
man
it
just
the
same
for
all
of
us
jane
did
try
to
be
a
man
and
reduced
her
howls
to
sniffs
there
was
a
pause
then
cyril
said
slowly
look
here
we
must
risk
that
syphon
i
button
it
up
inside
my
jacket
perhaps
no
one
will
notice
it
you
others
keep
well
in
front
of
me
there
are
lights
in
the
clergyman
house
they
not
gone
to
bed
yet
we
must
just
yell
as
loud
as
ever
we
can
now
all
scream
when
i
say
three
robert
you
do
the
yell
like
a
railway
engine
and
i
do
the
like
father
the
girls
can
do
as
they
please
one
two
three
a
yell
rent
the
silent
peace
of
the
evening
and
a
maid
at
one
of
the
vicarage
windows
paused
with
her
hand
on
the
one
two
three
another
yell
piercing
and
complex
startled
the
owls
and
starlings
to
a
flutter
of
feathers
in
the
belfry
below
the
maid
flew
from
the
vicarage
window
and
ran
down
the
vicarage
stairs
and
into
the
vicarage
kitchen
and
fainted
as
soon
as
she
had
explained
to
the
and
the
cook
and
the
cook
cousin
that
she
had
seen
a
ghost
it
was
quite
untrue
of
course
but
i
suppose
the
girl
nerves
were
a
little
upset
by
the
yelling
one
two
three
the
vicar
was
on
his
doorstep
by
this
time
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
yell
that
greeted
him
goodness
me
he
said
to
his
wife
my
dear
someone
being
murdered
in
the
church
give
me
my
hat
and
a
thick
stick
and
tell
andrew
to
come
after
me
i
expect
it
the
lunatic
who
stole
the
tongue
the
children
had
seen
the
flash
of
light
when
the
vicar
opened
his
front
door
they
had
seen
his
dark
form
on
his
doorstep
and
they
had
paused
for
breath
and
also
to
see
what
he
would
do
when
he
turned
back
for
his
hat
cyril
said
hastily
he
thinks
he
only
fancied
he
heard
something
you
do
half
yell
now
one
two
three
it
was
certainly
a
whole
yell
this
time
and
the
vicar
wife
flung
her
arms
round
her
husband
and
screamed
a
feeble
echo
of
it
you
sha
go
she
said
not
alone
jessie
the
maid
unfainted
and
came
out
of
the
kitchen
send
andrew
at
once
there
a
dangerous
lunatic
in
the
church
and
he
must
go
immediately
and
catch
him
i
expect
he
catch
it
too
said
jessie
to
herself
as
she
went
through
the
kitchen
door
here
andrew
she
said
there
someone
screaming
like
mad
in
the
church
and
the
missus
says
you
to
go
along
and
catch
it
not
alone
i
do
said
andrew
in
low
firm
tones
to
his
master
he
merely
said
yis
sir
you
heard
those
screams
i
did
think
i
noticed
a
sort
of
something
said
andrew
well
come
on
then
said
the
vicar
my
dear
i
go
he
pushed
her
gently
into
the
banged
the
door
and
rushed
out
dragging
andrew
by
the
arm
a
volley
of
yells
greeted
them
then
as
it
died
into
silence
andrew
shouted
hullo
you
there
did
you
call
yes
shouted
four
voices
they
seem
to
be
in
the
air
said
the
vicar
very
remarkable
where
are
you
shouted
andrew
and
cyril
replied
in
his
deepest
voice
very
slow
and
loud
church
tower
top
come
down
then
said
andrew
and
the
same
voice
replied
door
locked
my
goodness
said
the
vicar
andrew
fetch
the
stable
lantern
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
fetch
another
man
from
the
village
with
the
rest
of
the
gang
about
very
likely
no
sir
if
this
ai
a
trap
well
may
i
never
there
cook
cousin
at
the
back
door
now
he
a
keeper
sir
and
used
to
dealing
with
vicious
characters
and
he
got
his
gun
sir
hullo
there
shouted
cyril
from
the
come
up
and
let
us
out
we
said
andrew
i
to
get
a
policeman
and
a
gun
andrew
andrew
said
the
vicar
that
not
the
truth
it
near
enough
sir
for
the
likes
of
them
so
andrew
fetched
the
lantern
and
the
cook
cousin
and
the
wife
begged
them
all
to
be
very
careful
they
went
across
the
churchyard
it
was
quite
dark
now
and
as
they
went
they
talked
the
vicar
was
certain
a
lunatic
was
on
the
the
one
who
had
written
the
mad
letter
and
taken
the
cold
tongue
and
things
andrew
thought
it
was
a
trap
the
cook
cousin
alone
was
calm
great
cry
little
wool
said
he
dangerous
chaps
is
quieter
he
was
not
at
all
afraid
but
then
he
had
a
gun
that
was
why
he
was
asked
to
lead
the
way
up
the
worn
steep
dark
steps
of
the
he
did
lead
the
way
with
the
lantern
in
one
hand
and
the
gun
in
the
other
andrew
went
next
he
pretended
afterwards
that
this
was
because
he
was
braver
than
his
master
but
really
it
was
because
he
thought
of
traps
and
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
being
behind
the
others
for
fear
someone
should
come
softly
up
behind
him
and
catch
hold
of
his
legs
in
the
dark
they
went
on
and
on
and
round
and
round
the
little
corkscrew
staircase
then
through
the
loft
where
the
hung
with
soft
furry
ends
like
giant
caterpillars
then
up
another
stair
into
the
belfry
where
the
big
quiet
bells
are
and
then
on
up
a
ladder
with
broad
steps
and
then
up
a
little
stone
stair
and
at
the
top
of
that
there
was
a
little
door
and
the
door
was
bolted
on
the
stair
side
the
cook
cousin
who
was
a
gamekeeper
kicked
at
the
door
and
said
hullo
you
there
the
children
were
holding
on
to
each
other
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
trembling
with
anxiousness
and
very
hoarse
with
their
howls
they
could
hardly
speak
but
cyril
managed
to
reply
huskily
hullo
you
there
how
did
you
get
up
there
it
was
no
use
saying
we
flew
up
so
cyril
said
we
got
up
and
then
we
found
the
door
was
locked
and
we
could
get
down
let
us
out
do
how
many
of
you
are
there
asked
the
keeper
only
four
said
cyril
are
you
armed
are
we
what
i
got
my
gun
handy
so
you
best
not
try
any
tricks
said
the
keeper
if
we
open
the
door
will
you
promise
to
come
quietly
down
and
no
nonsense
yes
oh
yes
said
all
the
children
together
bless
me
said
the
vicar
surely
that
was
a
female
voice
shall
i
open
the
door
sir
said
the
keeper
andrew
went
down
a
few
steps
to
leave
room
for
the
others
he
said
afterwards
yes
said
the
vicar
open
the
door
remember
he
said
through
the
keyhole
we
have
come
to
release
you
you
will
keep
your
promise
to
refrain
from
violence
how
this
bolt
do
stick
said
the
keeper
anyone
think
it
been
drawed
for
half
a
year
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
when
all
the
bolts
were
drawn
the
keeper
spoke
words
through
the
keyhole
illustration
the
keeper
spoke
words
through
the
keyhole
i
do
open
said
he
till
you
gone
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
tower
and
if
one
of
you
comes
at
me
i
fire
now
we
all
over
on
the
other
side
said
the
voices
the
keeper
felt
pleased
with
himself
and
owned
himself
a
bold
man
when
he
threw
open
that
door
and
stepping
out
into
the
leads
flashed
the
full
light
of
the
stable
lantern
on
the
group
of
desperadoes
standing
against
the
parapet
on
the
other
side
of
the
tower
he
lowered
his
gun
and
he
nearly
dropped
the
lantern
so
help
me
he
cried
if
they
ai
a
pack
of
kiddies
the
vicar
now
advanced
how
did
you
come
here
he
asked
severely
tell
me
at
once
oh
take
us
down
said
jane
catching
at
his
coat
and
we
tell
you
anything
you
like
you
wo
believe
us
but
it
does
matter
oh
take
us
down
the
others
crowded
round
him
with
the
same
entreaty
all
but
cyril
he
had
enough
to
do
with
the
syphon
which
would
keep
slipping
down
under
his
jacket
it
needed
both
hands
to
keep
it
steady
in
its
place
but
he
said
standing
as
far
out
of
the
lantern
light
as
possible
please
do
take
us
down
so
they
were
taken
down
it
is
no
joke
to
go
down
a
strange
in
the
dark
but
the
keeper
helped
them
only
cyril
had
to
be
independent
because
of
the
syphon
it
would
keep
trying
to
get
away
down
the
ladder
it
all
but
escaped
cyril
just
caught
it
by
its
spout
and
as
nearly
as
possible
lost
his
footing
he
was
trembling
and
pale
when
at
last
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
winding
stair
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
stones
of
the
then
suddenly
the
keeper
caught
cyril
and
robert
each
by
an
arm
you
bring
along
the
gells
sir
said
he
you
and
andrew
can
manage
them
let
go
said
cyril
we
are
running
away
we
have
hurt
your
old
church
leave
go
you
just
come
along
said
the
keeper
and
cyril
dared
not
oppose
him
with
violence
because
just
then
the
syphon
began
to
slip
again
so
they
were
marched
into
the
vicarage
study
and
the
vicar
wife
came
rushing
in
oh
william
you
safe
she
cried
robert
hastened
to
allay
her
anxiety
yes
he
said
he
quite
safe
we
have
hurt
them
at
all
and
please
we
very
late
and
they
be
anxious
at
home
could
you
send
us
home
in
your
carriage
or
perhaps
there
a
hotel
near
where
we
could
get
a
carriage
said
anthea
martha
will
be
very
anxious
as
it
is
the
vicar
had
sunk
into
a
chair
overcome
by
emotion
and
amazement
cyril
had
also
sat
down
and
was
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
because
of
the
syphon
but
how
did
you
come
to
be
locked
up
in
the
asked
the
vicar
we
went
up
said
robert
slowly
and
we
were
tired
and
we
all
went
to
sleep
and
when
we
woke
up
we
found
the
door
was
locked
so
we
yelled
i
should
think
you
did
said
the
vicar
wife
frightening
everybody
out
of
their
wits
like
this
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
we
said
jane
gently
but
who
locked
the
door
asked
the
vicar
i
do
know
at
all
said
robert
with
perfect
truth
do
please
send
us
home
well
really
said
the
vicar
i
suppose
we
better
andrew
put
the
horse
to
and
you
can
take
them
home
not
alone
i
do
said
andrew
to
himself
and
the
vicar
went
on
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
he
went
on
talking
and
the
children
listened
miserably
but
the
keeper
was
not
listening
he
was
looking
at
the
unfortunate
cyril
he
knew
all
about
poachers
of
course
so
he
knew
how
people
look
when
they
hiding
something
the
vicar
had
just
got
to
the
part
about
trying
to
grow
up
to
be
a
blessing
to
your
parents
and
not
a
trouble
and
disgrace
when
the
keeper
suddenly
said
arst
him
what
he
got
there
under
his
jacket
and
cyril
knew
that
concealment
was
at
an
end
so
he
stood
up
and
squared
his
shoulders
and
tried
to
look
noble
like
the
boys
in
books
that
no
one
can
look
in
the
face
of
and
doubt
that
they
come
of
brave
and
noble
families
and
will
be
faithful
to
the
death
and
he
pulled
out
the
syphon
and
said
well
there
you
are
then
there
was
silence
cyril
went
on
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
yes
we
took
this
out
of
your
larder
and
some
chicken
and
tongue
and
bread
we
were
very
hungry
and
we
did
take
the
custard
or
jam
we
only
took
bread
and
meat
and
water
and
we
could
help
its
being
soda
kind
just
the
necessaries
of
life
and
we
left
to
pay
for
it
and
we
left
a
letter
and
we
very
sorry
and
my
father
will
pay
a
fine
and
anything
you
like
but
do
send
us
to
prison
mother
would
be
so
vexed
you
know
what
you
said
about
not
being
a
disgrace
well
do
you
go
and
do
it
to
us
that
all
we
as
sorry
as
we
can
be
there
however
did
you
get
up
to
the
larder
window
said
vicar
i
ca
tell
you
that
said
cyril
firmly
is
this
the
whole
truth
you
been
telling
me
asked
the
clergyman
no
answered
jane
suddenly
it
all
true
but
it
not
the
whole
truth
we
ca
tell
you
that
it
no
good
asking
oh
do
forgive
us
and
take
us
home
she
ran
to
the
vicar
wife
and
threw
her
arms
round
her
the
vicar
wife
put
her
arms
round
jane
and
the
keeper
whispered
behind
his
hand
to
the
vicar
they
all
right
sir
i
expect
it
a
pal
they
standing
by
someone
put
up
to
it
and
they
wo
peach
game
little
kids
tell
me
said
the
vicar
kindly
are
you
screening
someone
else
had
anyone
else
anything
to
do
with
this
yes
said
anthea
thinking
of
the
psammead
but
it
was
their
fault
very
well
my
dears
said
the
vicar
then
let
say
no
more
about
it
only
just
tell
us
why
you
wrote
such
an
odd
letter
i
do
know
said
cyril
you
see
anthea
wrote
it
in
such
a
hurry
and
it
really
did
seem
like
stealing
then
but
afterwards
when
we
found
we
could
get
down
off
the
it
seemed
just
exactly
like
it
we
are
all
very
sorry
say
no
more
about
it
said
the
vicar
wife
but
another
time
just
think
before
you
take
other
people
tongues
now
some
cake
and
milk
before
you
go
home
when
andrew
came
to
say
that
the
horse
was
put
to
and
was
he
expected
to
be
led
alone
into
the
trap
that
he
had
plainly
seen
from
the
first
he
found
the
children
eating
cake
and
drinking
milk
and
laughing
at
the
vicar
jokes
jane
was
sitting
on
the
vicar
wife
lap
so
you
see
they
got
off
better
than
they
deserved
the
gamekeeper
who
was
the
cook
cousin
asked
leave
to
drive
home
with
them
and
andrew
was
only
too
glad
to
have
someone
to
protect
him
from
that
trap
he
was
so
certain
of
when
the
wagonette
reached
their
own
house
between
the
and
the
the
children
were
very
sleepy
but
they
felt
that
they
and
the
keeper
were
friends
for
life
andrew
dumped
the
children
down
at
the
iron
gate
without
a
word
you
get
along
home
said
the
vicarage
cook
cousin
who
was
a
gamekeeper
i
get
me
home
on
shanks
mare
so
andrew
had
to
drive
off
alone
which
he
did
not
like
at
all
and
it
was
the
keeper
that
was
cousin
to
the
vicarage
cook
who
went
with
the
children
to
the
door
and
when
they
had
been
swept
to
bed
in
a
whirlwind
of
reproaches
remained
to
explain
to
martha
and
the
cook
and
the
housemaid
exactly
what
had
happened
he
explained
so
well
that
martha
was
quite
amicable
the
next
morning
after
that
he
often
used
to
come
over
and
see
martha
and
in
the
end
but
that
is
another
story
as
dear
kipling
says
martha
was
obliged
to
stick
to
what
she
had
said
the
night
before
about
keeping
the
children
indoors
the
next
day
for
a
punishment
but
she
was
at
all
ugly
about
it
and
agreed
to
let
robert
go
out
for
half
an
hour
to
get
something
he
particularly
wanted
this
of
course
was
the
day
wish
robert
rushed
to
the
found
the
psammead
and
presently
wished
for
but
that
too
is
another
story
chapter
vi
a
castle
and
no
dinner
the
others
were
to
be
kept
in
as
a
punishment
for
the
misfortunes
of
the
day
before
of
course
martha
thought
it
was
naughtiness
and
not
misfortune
so
you
must
not
blame
her
she
only
thought
she
was
doing
her
duty
you
know
people
often
say
they
do
not
like
to
punish
you
and
that
they
only
do
it
for
your
own
good
and
that
it
hurts
them
as
much
as
it
hurts
you
and
this
is
really
very
often
the
truth
martha
certainly
hated
having
to
punish
the
children
quite
as
much
as
they
hated
to
be
punished
for
one
thing
she
knew
what
a
noise
there
would
be
in
the
house
all
day
and
she
had
other
reasons
i
declare
she
said
to
the
cook
it
seems
almost
a
shame
keeping
of
them
indoors
this
lovely
day
but
they
are
that
audacious
they
be
walking
in
with
their
heads
knocked
off
some
of
these
days
if
i
put
my
foot
down
you
make
them
a
cake
for
tea
dear
and
we
have
baby
along
of
us
soon
as
we
got
a
bit
forrard
with
our
work
then
they
can
have
a
good
romp
with
him
out
of
the
way
now
eliza
come
get
on
with
them
beds
here
ten
nearly
and
no
rabbits
caught
people
say
that
in
kent
when
they
mean
and
no
work
done
so
all
the
others
were
kept
in
but
robert
as
i
have
said
was
allowed
to
go
out
for
half
an
hour
to
get
something
they
all
wanted
and
that
of
course
was
the
day
wish
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
for
the
day
was
already
so
hot
that
it
had
actually
for
the
first
time
come
out
of
its
own
accord
and
was
sitting
in
a
sort
of
pool
of
soft
sand
stretching
itself
and
trimming
its
whiskers
and
turning
its
snail
eyes
round
and
round
ha
it
said
when
its
left
eye
saw
robert
i
been
looking
for
you
where
are
the
rest
of
you
not
smashed
themselves
up
with
those
wings
i
hope
no
said
robert
but
the
wings
got
us
into
a
row
just
like
all
the
wishes
always
do
so
the
others
are
kept
indoors
and
i
was
only
let
out
for
half
an
hour
to
get
the
wish
so
please
let
me
wish
as
quickly
as
i
can
wish
away
said
the
psammead
twisting
itself
round
in
the
sand
but
robert
could
wish
away
he
forgot
all
the
things
he
had
been
thinking
about
and
nothing
would
come
into
his
head
but
little
things
for
himself
like
candy
a
foreign
stamp
album
or
a
knife
with
three
blades
and
a
corkscrew
he
sat
down
to
think
better
of
things
the
others
would
not
have
cared
for
such
as
a
football
or
a
pair
of
or
to
be
able
to
lick
simpkins
minor
thoroughly
when
he
went
back
to
school
well
said
the
psammead
at
last
you
better
hurry
up
with
that
wish
of
yours
time
flies
i
know
it
does
said
robert
ca
think
what
to
wish
for
i
wish
you
could
give
one
of
the
others
their
wish
without
their
having
to
come
here
to
ask
for
it
oh
but
it
was
too
late
the
psammead
had
blown
itself
out
to
about
three
times
its
proper
size
and
now
it
collapsed
like
a
pricked
bubble
and
with
a
deep
sigh
leaned
back
against
the
edge
of
the
quite
faint
with
the
effort
there
it
said
in
a
weak
voice
it
was
tremendously
hard
but
i
did
it
run
along
home
or
they
sure
to
wish
for
something
silly
before
you
get
there
they
were
quite
sure
robert
felt
this
and
as
he
ran
home
his
mind
was
deeply
occupied
with
the
sort
of
wishes
he
might
find
they
had
wished
in
his
absence
they
might
wish
for
rabbits
or
white
mice
or
chocolate
or
a
fine
day
or
even
and
that
was
most
likely
someone
might
have
said
i
do
wish
to
goodness
robert
would
hurry
up
well
he
hurrying
up
and
so
they
would
have
had
their
wish
and
the
day
would
be
wasted
then
he
tried
to
think
what
they
could
wish
for
something
that
would
be
amusing
indoors
that
had
been
his
own
difficulty
from
the
beginning
so
few
things
are
amusing
indoors
when
the
sun
is
shining
outside
and
you
may
go
out
however
much
you
want
to
do
so
robert
was
running
as
fast
as
he
could
but
when
he
turned
the
corner
that
ought
to
have
brought
him
within
sight
of
the
nightmare
the
ornamental
on
the
top
of
the
house
he
opened
his
eyes
so
wide
that
he
had
to
drop
into
a
walk
for
you
can
not
run
with
your
eyes
wide
open
then
suddenly
he
stopped
short
for
there
was
no
house
to
be
seen
the
front
garden
railings
were
gone
too
and
where
the
house
had
stood
robert
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
yes
the
others
wished
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
and
they
must
have
wished
that
they
lived
in
a
castle
for
there
the
castle
stood
black
and
stately
and
very
tall
and
broad
with
battlements
and
lancet
windows
and
eight
great
towers
and
where
the
garden
and
the
orchard
had
been
there
were
white
things
dotted
like
mushrooms
robert
walked
slowly
on
and
as
he
got
nearer
he
saw
that
these
were
tents
and
men
in
armor
were
walking
about
among
the
tents
crowds
and
crowds
of
them
illustration
there
the
castle
stood
black
and
stately
oh
said
robert
fervently
they
they
wished
for
a
castle
and
it
being
besieged
it
just
like
that
i
wish
never
seen
the
beastly
thing
at
the
little
window
above
the
great
gateway
across
the
moat
that
now
lay
where
the
garden
had
been
but
half
an
hour
ago
someone
was
waving
something
pale
robert
thought
it
was
one
of
handkerchiefs
they
had
never
been
white
since
the
day
when
he
had
upset
the
bottle
of
combined
toning
and
fixing
solution
into
the
drawer
where
they
were
robert
waved
back
and
immediately
felt
that
he
had
been
unwise
for
this
signal
had
been
seen
by
the
besieging
force
and
two
men
in
were
coming
towards
him
they
had
high
brown
boots
on
their
long
legs
and
they
came
towards
him
with
such
great
strides
that
robert
remembered
the
shortness
of
his
own
legs
and
did
not
run
away
he
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
himself
and
he
feared
it
might
be
irritating
to
the
foe
so
he
stood
still
and
the
two
men
seemed
quite
pleased
with
him
by
my
halidom
said
one
a
brave
varlet
this
robert
felt
pleased
at
being
brave
and
somehow
it
made
him
brave
he
passed
over
the
varlet
it
was
the
way
people
talked
in
historical
romances
for
the
young
he
knew
and
it
was
evidently
not
meant
for
rudeness
he
only
hoped
he
would
be
able
to
understand
what
they
said
to
him
he
had
not
been
always
able
quite
to
follow
the
conversations
in
the
historical
romances
for
the
young
his
garb
is
strange
said
the
other
some
outlandish
treachery
belike
say
lad
what
brings
thee
hither
robert
knew
this
meant
now
then
youngster
what
are
you
up
to
here
eh
so
he
said
if
you
please
i
want
to
go
home
go
then
said
the
man
in
the
longest
boots
none
hindereth
and
nought
lets
us
to
follow
zooks
he
added
in
a
cautious
undertone
i
misdoubt
me
but
he
beareth
tidings
to
the
besieged
where
dwellest
thou
young
knave
inquired
the
man
with
the
largest
over
there
said
robert
and
directly
he
had
said
it
he
knew
he
ought
to
have
said
yonder
ha
sayest
so
rejoined
the
longest
boots
come
hither
boy
this
is
matter
for
our
leader
and
to
the
leader
robert
was
dragged
forthwith
by
the
reluctant
ear
illustration
robert
was
dragged
forthwith
by
the
reluctant
ear
the
leader
was
the
most
glorious
creature
robert
had
ever
seen
he
was
exactly
like
the
pictures
robert
had
so
often
admired
in
the
historical
romances
he
had
armor
and
a
helmet
and
a
horse
and
a
crest
and
feathers
and
a
shield
and
a
lance
and
a
sword
his
armor
and
his
weapons
were
all
i
am
almost
sure
of
quite
different
periods
the
shield
was
thirteenth
century
while
the
sword
was
of
the
pattern
used
in
the
peninsular
war
the
cuirass
was
of
the
time
of
charles
and
the
helmet
dated
from
the
second
crusade
the
arms
on
the
shield
were
very
grand
three
red
running
lions
on
a
blue
ground
the
tents
were
of
the
latest
brand
approved
of
by
our
modern
war
office
and
the
whole
appearance
of
camp
army
and
leader
might
have
been
a
shock
to
some
but
robert
was
dumb
with
admiration
and
it
all
seemed
to
him
perfectly
correct
because
he
knew
no
more
of
heraldry
or
archæology
than
the
gifted
artists
who
usually
drew
the
pictures
for
the
historical
romances
the
scene
was
indeed
exactly
like
a
picture
he
admired
it
all
so
much
that
he
felt
braver
than
ever
come
hither
lad
said
the
glorious
leader
when
the
men
in
cromwellian
had
said
a
few
low
eager
words
and
he
took
off
his
helmet
because
he
could
not
see
properly
with
it
on
he
had
a
kind
face
and
long
fair
hair
have
no
fear
thou
shalt
take
no
scathe
he
said
robert
was
glad
of
that
he
wondered
what
scathe
was
and
if
it
was
nastier
than
the
medicine
which
he
had
to
take
sometimes
unfold
thy
tale
without
alarm
said
the
leader
kindly
whence
comest
thou
and
what
is
thine
intent
my
what
said
robert
what
seekest
thou
to
accomplish
what
is
thine
errand
that
thou
wanderest
here
alone
among
these
rough
poor
child
thy
mother
heart
aches
for
thee
now
i
warrant
me
i
do
think
so
said
robert
you
see
she
does
know
i
out
illustration
he
wiped
away
a
manly
tear
the
leader
wiped
away
a
manly
tear
exactly
as
a
leader
in
a
historical
romance
would
have
done
and
said
fear
not
to
speak
the
truth
my
child
thou
hast
nought
to
fear
from
wulfric
de
talbot
robert
had
a
wild
feeling
that
this
glorious
leader
of
the
besieging
party
being
himself
part
of
a
wish
would
be
able
to
understand
better
than
martha
or
the
gipsies
or
the
policeman
in
rochester
or
the
clergyman
of
yesterday
the
true
tale
of
the
wishes
and
the
psammead
the
only
difficulty
was
that
he
knew
he
could
never
remember
enough
quothas
and
beshrew
me
and
things
like
that
to
make
his
talk
sound
like
the
talk
of
a
boy
in
a
historical
romance
however
he
began
boldly
enough
with
a
sentence
straight
out
of
de
courcy
or
the
boy
he
said
grammercy
for
thy
courtesy
fair
sir
knight
the
fact
is
it
like
this
and
i
hope
you
not
in
a
hurry
because
the
story
rather
a
breather
father
and
mother
are
away
and
when
we
went
down
playing
in
the
we
found
a
psammead
i
cry
thee
mercy
a
sammyadd
said
the
knight
yes
a
sort
of
of
fairy
or
enchanter
yes
that
it
an
enchanter
and
he
said
we
could
have
a
wish
every
day
and
we
wished
first
to
be
beautiful
thy
wish
was
scarce
granted
muttered
one
of
the
looking
at
robert
who
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
though
he
thought
the
remark
very
rude
indeed
and
then
we
wished
for
money
treasure
you
know
but
we
could
spend
it
and
yesterday
we
wished
for
wings
and
we
got
them
and
we
had
a
ripping
time
to
begin
with
thy
speech
is
strange
and
uncouth
said
sir
wulfric
de
talbot
repeat
thy
words
what
hadst
thou
a
ripping
i
mean
a
jolly
no
we
were
contented
with
our
lot
what
i
mean
only
after
we
got
into
an
awful
fix
what
is
a
fix
a
fray
mayhap
no
not
a
fray
a
a
a
tight
place
a
dungeon
alas
for
thy
youthful
fettered
limbs
said
the
knight
with
polite
sympathy
it
was
a
dungeon
we
just
just
encountered
undeserved
misfortunes
robert
explained
and
we
are
punished
by
not
being
allowed
to
go
out
that
where
i
live
he
pointed
to
the
castle
the
others
are
in
there
and
they
not
allowed
to
go
out
it
all
the
psammead
i
mean
the
enchanter
fault
i
wish
we
never
seen
him
he
is
an
enchanter
of
might
oh
yes
of
might
and
main
rather
and
thou
deemest
that
it
is
the
spells
of
the
enchanter
whom
thou
hast
angered
that
have
lent
strength
to
the
besieging
party
said
the
gallant
leader
but
know
thou
that
wulfric
de
talbot
needs
no
enchanter
aid
to
lead
his
followers
to
victory
no
i
sure
you
do
said
robert
with
hasty
courtesy
of
course
not
you
would
you
know
but
all
the
same
it
partly
his
fault
but
we
most
to
blame
you
could
have
done
anything
if
it
been
for
us
how
now
bold
boy
asked
sir
wulfric
haughtily
thy
speech
is
dark
and
eke
scarce
courteous
unravel
me
this
riddle
oh
said
robert
desperately
of
course
you
do
know
it
but
not
at
all
you
only
here
because
the
others
must
have
been
idiots
enough
to
wish
for
a
castle
and
when
the
sun
sets
you
just
vanish
away
and
it
be
all
right
the
captain
and
the
exchanged
glances
at
first
pitying
and
then
sterner
as
the
man
said
beware
my
noble
lord
the
urchin
doth
but
feign
madness
to
escape
from
our
clutches
shall
we
not
bind
him
i
no
more
mad
than
you
are
said
robert
angrily
perhaps
not
so
much
only
i
was
an
idiot
to
think
you
understand
anything
let
me
go
i
have
done
anything
to
you
whither
asked
the
knight
who
seemed
to
have
believed
all
the
enchanter
story
till
it
came
to
his
own
share
in
it
whither
wouldst
thou
wend
home
of
course
robert
pointed
to
the
castle
to
carry
news
of
succor
nay
all
right
then
said
robert
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
then
let
me
go
somewhere
else
his
mind
sought
eagerly
among
the
memories
of
the
historical
romance
sir
wulfric
de
talbot
he
said
slowly
should
think
foul
scorn
to
to
keep
a
chap
i
mean
one
who
has
done
him
no
hurt
when
he
wants
to
cut
off
quietly
i
mean
to
depart
without
violence
this
to
my
face
beshrew
thee
for
a
knave
replied
sir
wulfric
but
the
appeal
seemed
to
have
gone
home
yet
thou
sayest
sooth
he
added
thoughtfully
go
where
thou
wilt
he
added
nobly
thou
art
free
wulfric
de
talbot
warreth
not
with
babes
and
jakin
here
shall
bear
thee
company
all
right
said
robert
wildly
jakin
will
enjoy
himself
i
think
come
on
jakin
sir
wulfric
i
salute
thee
he
saluted
after
the
modern
military
manner
and
set
off
running
to
the
jakin
long
boots
keeping
up
easily
he
found
the
fairy
he
dug
it
up
he
woke
it
up
he
implored
it
to
give
him
one
more
wish
i
done
two
already
it
grumbled
and
one
was
as
stiff
a
bit
of
work
as
ever
i
did
oh
do
do
do
do
said
robert
while
jakin
looked
on
with
an
expression
of
horror
at
the
strange
beast
that
talked
and
gazed
with
its
snail
eyes
at
him
illustration
oh
do
do
said
robert
well
what
is
it
snapped
the
psammead
with
cross
sleepiness
i
wish
i
was
with
the
others
said
robert
and
the
psammead
began
to
swell
robert
never
thought
of
wishing
the
castle
and
the
siege
away
of
course
he
knew
they
had
all
come
out
of
a
wish
but
swords
and
daggers
and
pikes
and
lances
seemed
much
too
real
to
be
wished
away
robert
lost
consciousness
for
an
instant
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
others
were
crowding
round
him
we
never
heard
you
come
in
they
said
how
awfully
jolly
of
you
to
wish
it
to
give
us
our
wish
of
course
we
understood
that
was
what
you
done
but
you
ought
to
have
told
us
suppose
we
wished
something
silly
silly
said
robert
very
crossly
indeed
how
much
sillier
could
you
have
been
i
like
to
know
you
nearly
settled
i
can
tell
you
then
he
told
his
story
and
the
others
admitted
that
it
certainly
had
been
rough
on
him
but
they
praised
his
courage
and
cleverness
so
much
that
he
presently
got
back
his
lost
temper
and
felt
braver
than
ever
and
consented
to
be
captain
of
the
besieged
force
we
have
done
anything
yet
said
anthea
comfortably
we
waited
for
you
we
going
to
shoot
at
them
through
these
little
loopholes
with
the
bow
and
arrows
uncle
gave
you
and
you
shall
have
first
shot
i
do
think
i
would
said
robert
cautiously
you
do
know
what
they
like
near
to
they
got
bows
and
arrows
an
awful
length
and
swords
and
pikes
and
daggers
and
all
sorts
of
sharp
things
they
all
quite
quite
real
it
not
just
a
a
picture
or
a
vision
or
anything
they
can
or
kill
us
even
i
should
wonder
i
can
feel
my
ear
all
sore
yet
look
here
have
you
explored
the
castle
because
i
think
we
better
let
them
alone
as
long
as
they
let
us
alone
i
heard
that
jakin
man
say
they
were
going
to
attack
till
just
before
sundown
we
can
be
getting
ready
for
the
attack
are
there
any
soldiers
in
the
castle
to
defend
it
we
do
know
said
cyril
you
see
directly
i
wished
we
were
in
a
besieged
castle
everything
seemed
to
go
upside
down
and
when
it
came
straight
we
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
camp
and
things
and
you
and
of
course
we
kept
on
looking
at
everything
is
this
room
jolly
it
as
real
as
real
it
was
it
was
square
with
stone
walls
four
feet
thick
and
great
beams
for
ceiling
a
low
door
at
the
corner
led
to
a
flight
of
steps
up
and
down
the
children
went
down
they
found
themselves
in
a
great
arched
the
enormous
doors
were
shut
and
barred
there
was
a
window
in
a
little
room
at
the
bottom
of
the
round
turret
up
which
the
stair
wound
rather
larger
than
the
other
windows
and
looking
through
it
they
saw
that
the
drawbridge
was
up
and
the
portcullis
down
the
moat
looked
very
wide
and
deep
opposite
the
great
door
that
led
to
the
moat
was
another
great
door
with
a
little
door
in
it
the
children
went
through
this
and
found
themselves
in
a
big
courtyard
with
the
great
grey
walls
of
the
castle
rising
dark
and
heavy
on
all
four
sides
near
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
stood
martha
moving
her
right
hand
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
air
the
cook
was
stooping
down
and
moving
her
hands
also
in
a
very
curious
way
but
the
oddest
and
at
the
same
time
most
terrible
thing
was
the
lamb
who
was
sitting
on
nothing
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
laughing
happily
the
children
ran
towards
him
just
as
anthea
was
reaching
out
her
arms
to
take
him
martha
said
crossly
let
him
alone
do
miss
when
he
good
but
what
he
said
anthea
doing
why
in
his
high
chair
as
good
as
gold
a
precious
watching
me
doing
of
the
ironing
get
along
with
you
do
my
iron
cold
again
she
went
towards
the
cook
and
seemed
to
poke
an
invisible
fire
with
an
unseen
poker
the
cook
seemed
to
be
putting
an
unseen
dish
into
an
invisible
oven
run
along
with
you
do
she
said
i
behindhand
as
it
is
you
get
no
dinner
if
you
come
of
me
like
this
come
off
you
goes
or
i
pin
a
discloth
to
some
of
your
tails
you
the
lamb
all
right
asked
jane
anxiously
right
as
ninepence
if
you
do
come
unsettling
of
him
i
thought
you
like
to
be
rid
of
him
for
but
take
him
if
you
want
him
for
gracious
sake
no
no
they
said
and
hastened
away
they
would
have
to
defend
the
castle
presently
and
the
lamb
was
safer
even
suspended
in
mid
air
in
an
invisible
kitchen
than
in
the
of
the
besieged
castle
they
went
through
the
first
doorway
they
came
to
and
sat
down
helplessly
on
a
wooden
bench
that
ran
along
the
room
inside
how
awful
said
anthea
and
jane
together
and
jane
added
i
feel
as
if
i
was
in
a
lunatic
asylum
what
does
it
mean
anthea
said
it
creepy
i
do
like
it
i
wish
we
wished
for
something
plain
a
or
a
donkey
or
something
it
no
use
wishing
said
robert
bitterly
and
cyril
said
do
be
quiet
i
want
to
think
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
the
others
looked
about
them
they
were
in
a
long
room
with
an
arched
roof
there
were
wooden
tables
along
it
and
one
across
at
the
end
of
the
room
on
a
sort
of
raised
platform
the
room
was
very
dim
and
dark
the
floor
was
strewn
with
dry
things
like
sticks
and
they
did
not
smell
nice
cyril
sat
up
suddenly
and
said
look
here
it
all
right
i
think
it
like
this
you
know
we
wished
that
the
servants
should
notice
any
difference
when
we
got
wishes
and
nothing
happens
to
the
lamb
unless
we
specially
wish
it
to
so
of
course
they
do
notice
the
castle
or
anything
but
then
the
castle
is
on
the
same
place
where
our
house
was
is
i
mean
and
the
servants
have
to
go
on
being
in
the
house
or
else
they
notice
but
you
have
a
castle
mixed
up
with
our
house
and
so
ca
see
the
house
because
we
see
the
castle
and
they
ca
see
the
castle
because
they
go
on
seeing
the
house
and
so
oh
said
jane
you
make
my
head
go
all
swimmy
like
being
on
a
roundabout
it
does
matter
only
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
see
our
dinner
that
all
because
if
it
invisible
it
be
unfeelable
as
well
and
then
we
ca
eat
it
i
it
will
because
i
tried
to
feel
if
i
could
feel
the
lamb
chair
and
there
was
nothing
under
him
at
all
but
air
and
we
ca
eat
air
and
i
feel
just
as
if
i
had
had
any
breakfast
for
years
and
years
it
no
use
thinking
about
it
said
anthea
let
go
on
exploring
perhaps
we
might
find
something
to
eat
this
lighted
hope
in
every
breast
and
they
went
on
exploring
the
castle
but
though
it
was
the
most
perfect
and
delightful
castle
you
can
possibly
imagine
and
furnished
in
the
most
complete
and
beautiful
manner
neither
food
nor
were
to
be
found
in
it
if
you
only
thought
of
wishing
to
be
besieged
in
a
castle
thoroughly
garrisoned
and
provisioned
said
jane
reproachfully
you
ca
think
of
everything
you
know
said
anthea
i
should
think
it
must
be
nearly
by
now
it
was
but
they
hung
about
watching
the
strange
movements
of
the
servants
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
because
of
course
they
could
be
sure
where
the
of
the
invisible
house
was
presently
they
saw
martha
carrying
an
invisible
tray
across
the
courtyard
for
it
seemed
that
by
the
most
fortunate
accident
the
of
the
house
and
the
of
the
castle
were
in
the
same
place
but
oh
how
their
hearts
sank
when
they
perceived
that
the
tray
invisible
they
waited
in
wretched
silence
while
martha
went
through
the
form
of
carving
an
unseen
leg
of
mutton
and
serving
invisible
greens
and
potatoes
with
a
spoon
that
no
one
could
see
when
she
had
left
the
room
the
children
looked
at
the
empty
table
and
then
at
each
other
this
is
worse
than
anything
said
robert
who
had
not
till
now
been
particularly
keen
on
his
dinner
i
not
so
very
hungry
said
anthea
trying
to
make
the
best
of
things
as
usual
cyril
tightened
his
belt
ostentatiously
jane
burst
into
tears
chapter
vii
a
siege
and
bed
the
children
were
sitting
in
the
gloomy
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
long
bare
wooden
tables
there
was
now
no
hope
martha
had
brought
in
the
dinner
and
the
dinner
was
invisible
and
unfeelable
too
for
when
they
rubbed
their
hands
along
the
table
they
knew
but
too
well
that
for
them
there
was
nothing
there
table
suddenly
cyril
felt
in
his
pocket
right
he
cried
look
here
biscuits
somewhat
broken
and
crumbled
certainly
but
still
biscuits
three
whole
ones
and
a
generous
handful
of
crumbs
and
fragments
i
got
them
this
morning
cook
and
i
quite
forgotten
he
explained
as
he
divided
them
with
scrupulous
fairness
into
four
heaps
they
were
eaten
in
a
happy
silence
though
they
had
an
odd
taste
because
they
had
been
in
cyril
pocket
all
the
morning
with
a
hank
of
tarred
twine
some
green
and
a
ball
of
cobbler
wax
yes
but
look
here
squirrel
said
robert
you
so
clever
at
explaining
about
invisibleness
and
all
that
how
is
it
the
biscuits
are
here
and
all
the
bread
and
meat
and
things
have
disappeared
i
do
know
said
cyril
after
a
pause
unless
it
because
had
them
nothing
about
has
changed
everything
in
my
pocket
all
right
then
if
we
the
mutton
it
would
be
real
said
robert
oh
i
wish
we
could
find
it
but
we
ca
find
it
i
suppose
it
is
ours
till
we
got
it
in
our
mouths
or
in
our
pockets
said
jane
thinking
of
the
biscuits
who
puts
mutton
in
their
pockets
said
cyril
but
i
know
at
any
rate
i
try
it
he
leaned
over
the
table
with
his
face
about
an
inch
from
it
and
kept
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
taking
bites
out
of
air
it
no
good
said
robert
in
deep
dejection
you
only
hullo
cyril
stood
up
with
a
grin
of
triumph
holding
a
square
piece
of
bread
in
his
mouth
it
was
quite
real
everyone
saw
it
it
is
true
that
directly
he
bit
a
piece
off
the
rest
vanished
but
it
was
all
right
because
he
knew
he
had
it
in
his
hand
though
he
could
neither
see
nor
feel
it
he
took
another
bite
from
the
air
between
his
fingers
and
it
turned
into
bread
as
he
bit
the
next
moment
all
the
others
were
following
his
example
and
opening
and
shutting
their
mouths
an
inch
or
so
from
the
table
robert
captured
a
slice
of
mutton
and
but
i
think
i
will
draw
a
veil
over
the
rest
of
this
painful
scene
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
all
had
enough
mutton
and
that
when
martha
came
to
change
the
plates
she
said
she
had
never
seen
such
a
mess
in
all
her
born
days
the
pudding
was
fortunately
a
plain
suet
one
and
in
answer
to
martha
questions
the
children
all
with
one
accord
said
that
they
would
have
molasses
on
it
nor
jam
nor
sugar
just
plain
please
they
said
martha
said
well
i
never
what
next
i
wonder
and
went
away
then
ensued
another
scene
on
which
i
will
not
dwell
for
nobody
looks
nice
picking
up
slices
of
suet
pudding
from
the
table
in
its
mouth
like
a
dog
the
great
thing
after
all
was
that
they
had
had
dinner
and
now
everyone
felt
more
courage
to
prepare
for
the
attack
that
was
to
be
delivered
before
sunset
robert
as
captain
insisted
on
climbing
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
towers
to
reconnoitre
so
up
they
all
went
and
now
they
could
see
all
round
the
castle
and
could
see
too
that
beyond
the
moat
on
every
side
tents
of
the
besieging
party
were
pitched
rather
uncomfortable
shivers
ran
down
the
children
backs
as
they
saw
that
all
the
men
were
very
busy
cleaning
or
sharpening
their
arms
their
bows
and
polishing
their
shields
a
large
party
came
along
the
road
with
horses
dragging
along
the
great
trunk
of
a
tree
and
cyril
felt
quite
pale
because
he
knew
this
was
for
a
what
a
good
thing
we
got
a
moat
he
said
and
what
a
good
thing
the
drawbridge
is
up
i
should
never
have
known
how
to
work
it
of
course
it
would
be
up
in
a
besieged
castle
you
think
there
ought
to
have
been
soldiers
in
it
would
you
said
robert
you
see
you
do
know
how
long
it
been
besieged
said
cyril
darkly
perhaps
most
of
the
brave
defenders
were
killed
early
in
the
siege
and
all
the
provisions
eaten
and
now
there
are
only
a
few
intrepid
survivors
that
us
and
we
are
going
to
defend
it
to
the
death
how
do
you
begin
defending
to
the
death
i
mean
asked
anthea
we
ought
to
be
heavily
armed
and
then
shoot
at
them
when
they
advance
to
the
attack
they
used
to
pour
boiling
lead
down
on
besiegers
when
they
got
too
close
said
anthea
father
showed
me
the
holes
on
purpose
for
pouring
it
down
through
at
bodiam
castle
and
there
are
holes
like
it
in
the
here
i
think
i
glad
it
only
a
game
it
only
a
game
is
it
said
jane
but
no
one
answered
the
children
found
plenty
of
strange
weapons
in
the
castle
and
if
they
were
armed
at
all
it
was
soon
plain
that
they
would
be
as
cyril
said
armed
heavily
for
these
swords
and
lances
and
crossbows
were
far
too
weighty
even
for
cyril
manly
strength
and
as
for
the
longbows
none
of
the
children
could
even
begin
to
bend
them
the
daggers
were
better
but
jane
hoped
that
the
besiegers
would
not
come
close
enough
for
daggers
to
be
of
any
use
never
mind
we
can
hurl
them
like
javelins
said
cyril
or
drop
them
on
people
heads
i
say
there
are
lots
of
stones
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtyard
if
we
took
some
of
those
up
just
to
drop
on
their
heads
if
they
were
to
try
swimming
the
moat
so
a
heap
of
stones
grew
apace
up
in
the
room
above
the
gate
and
another
heap
a
shiny
spiky
heap
of
daggers
and
knives
as
anthea
was
crossing
the
courtyard
for
more
stones
a
sudden
and
valuable
idea
came
to
her
she
went
to
martha
and
said
may
we
have
just
biscuits
for
tea
going
to
play
at
besieged
castles
and
we
like
the
biscuits
to
provision
the
garrison
put
mine
in
my
pocket
please
my
hands
are
so
dirty
and
i
tell
the
others
to
fetch
theirs
this
was
indeed
a
happy
thought
for
now
with
four
generous
handfuls
of
air
which
turned
to
biscuits
as
martha
crammed
it
into
their
pockets
the
garrison
was
well
provisioned
till
sundown
they
brought
up
some
iron
pots
of
cold
water
to
pour
on
the
besiegers
instead
of
hot
lead
with
which
the
castle
did
not
seem
to
be
provided
the
afternoon
passed
with
wonderful
quickness
it
was
very
exciting
but
none
of
them
except
robert
could
feel
all
the
time
that
this
was
real
deadly
dangerous
work
to
the
others
who
had
only
seen
the
camp
and
the
besiegers
from
a
distance
the
whole
thing
seemed
half
a
game
of
and
half
a
splendidly
distinct
and
perfectly
safe
dream
but
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
robert
could
feel
this
when
it
seemed
to
be
the
biscuits
were
eaten
with
water
from
the
deep
well
in
the
courtyard
drunk
out
of
horns
cyril
insisted
on
putting
by
eight
of
the
biscuits
in
case
anyone
should
feel
faint
in
stress
of
battle
just
as
he
was
putting
away
the
reserve
biscuits
in
a
sort
of
little
stone
cupboard
without
a
door
a
sudden
sound
made
him
drop
three
it
was
the
loud
fierce
cry
of
a
trumpet
you
see
it
real
said
robert
and
they
are
going
to
attack
all
rushed
to
the
narrow
windows
yes
said
robert
they
all
coming
out
of
their
tents
and
moving
about
like
ants
there
that
jakin
dancing
about
where
the
bridge
joins
on
i
wish
he
could
see
me
put
my
tongue
out
at
him
yah
the
others
were
far
too
pale
to
wish
to
put
their
tongues
out
at
anybody
they
looked
at
robert
with
surprised
respect
anthea
said
you
really
brave
robert
rot
cyril
pallor
turned
to
redness
now
all
in
a
minute
he
been
getting
ready
to
be
brave
all
the
afternoon
and
i
was
ready
all
i
shall
be
braver
than
he
is
in
half
a
jiffy
oh
dear
said
jane
what
does
it
matter
which
of
you
is
the
bravest
i
think
cyril
was
a
perfect
silly
to
wish
for
a
castle
and
i
do
want
to
play
it
robert
was
beginning
sternly
but
anthea
interrupted
oh
yes
you
do
she
said
coaxingly
it
a
very
nice
game
really
because
they
ca
possibly
get
in
and
if
they
do
the
women
and
children
are
always
spared
by
civilised
armies
but
are
you
quite
quite
sure
they
civilised
asked
jane
panting
they
seem
to
be
such
a
long
time
ago
of
course
they
are
anthea
pointed
cheerfully
through
the
narrow
window
why
look
at
the
little
flags
on
their
lances
how
bright
they
are
and
how
fine
the
leader
is
look
that
him
is
it
robert
on
the
gray
horse
jane
consented
to
look
and
the
scene
was
almost
too
pretty
to
be
alarming
the
green
turf
the
white
tents
the
flash
of
pennoned
lances
the
gleam
of
armour
and
the
bright
colours
of
scarf
and
tunic
it
was
just
like
a
splendid
coloured
picture
the
trumpets
were
sounding
and
when
the
trumpeters
stopped
for
breath
the
children
could
hear
the
of
armour
and
the
murmur
of
voices
a
trumpeter
came
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
which
now
seemed
very
much
narrower
than
at
first
and
blew
the
longest
and
loudest
blast
they
had
yet
heard
when
the
blaring
noise
had
died
away
a
man
who
was
with
the
trumpeter
shouted
what
ho
within
there
and
his
voice
came
plainly
to
the
garrison
in
the
hullo
there
robert
bellowed
back
at
once
in
the
name
of
our
lord
the
king
and
of
our
good
lord
and
trusty
leader
sir
wulfric
de
talbot
we
summon
this
castle
to
surrender
on
pain
of
fire
and
sword
and
no
quarter
do
ye
surrender
bawled
robert
of
course
we
do
never
the
man
answered
back
then
your
fate
be
on
your
own
heads
cheer
said
robert
in
a
fierce
whisper
cheer
to
show
them
we
afraid
and
rattle
the
daggers
to
make
more
noise
one
two
three
hip
hip
hooray
again
hip
hip
hooray
one
more
hip
hip
hooray
the
cheers
were
rather
high
and
weak
but
the
rattle
of
the
daggers
lent
them
strength
and
depth
there
was
another
shout
from
the
camp
across
the
moat
and
then
the
beleaguered
fortress
felt
that
the
attack
had
indeed
begun
it
was
getting
rather
dark
in
the
room
above
the
great
gate
and
jane
took
a
very
little
courage
as
she
remembered
that
sunset
be
far
off
now
the
moat
is
dreadfully
thin
said
anthea
but
they
ca
get
into
the
castle
even
if
they
do
swim
over
said
robert
and
as
he
spoke
he
heard
feet
on
the
stair
outside
heavy
feet
and
the
clang
of
steel
no
one
breathed
for
a
moment
the
steel
and
the
feet
went
on
up
the
turret
stairs
then
robert
sprang
softly
to
the
door
he
pulled
off
his
shoes
wait
here
he
whispered
and
stole
quickly
and
softly
after
the
boots
and
the
he
peeped
into
the
upper
room
the
man
was
there
and
it
was
jakin
all
dripping
with
and
he
was
fiddling
about
with
the
machinery
which
robert
felt
sure
worked
the
drawbridge
robert
banged
the
door
suddenly
and
turned
the
great
key
in
the
lock
just
as
jakin
sprang
to
the
inside
of
the
door
then
he
tore
downstairs
and
into
the
little
turret
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
where
the
biggest
window
was
we
ought
to
have
defended
he
cried
to
the
others
as
they
followed
him
he
was
just
in
time
another
man
had
swum
over
and
his
fingers
were
on
the
robert
never
knew
how
the
man
had
managed
to
climb
up
out
of
the
water
but
he
saw
the
clinging
fingers
and
hit
them
as
hard
as
he
could
with
an
iron
bar
that
he
caught
up
from
the
floor
the
man
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
in
another
moment
robert
was
outside
the
little
room
had
banged
its
door
and
was
shooting
home
the
enormous
bolts
and
calling
to
cyril
to
lend
a
hand
illustration
the
man
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
then
they
stood
in
the
arched
breathing
hard
and
looking
at
each
other
jane
mouth
was
open
cheer
up
jenny
said
robert
it
wo
last
much
longer
there
was
a
creaking
above
and
something
rattled
and
shook
the
pavement
they
stood
on
seemed
to
tremble
then
a
crash
told
them
that
the
drawbridge
had
been
lowered
to
its
place
that
that
beast
jakin
said
robert
there
still
the
portcullis
i
almost
certain
that
worked
from
lower
down
and
now
the
drawbridge
rang
and
echoed
hollowly
to
the
hoofs
of
horses
and
the
tramp
of
armed
men
up
quick
cried
robert
let
drop
things
on
them
even
the
girls
were
feeling
almost
brave
now
they
followed
robert
quickly
and
under
his
directions
began
to
drop
stones
out
through
the
long
narrow
windows
there
was
a
confused
noise
below
and
some
groans
oh
dear
said
anthea
putting
down
the
stone
she
was
just
going
to
drop
out
i
afraid
we
hurt
somebody
robert
caught
up
the
stone
in
a
fury
i
should
hope
we
he
said
i
give
something
for
a
jolly
good
boiling
kettle
of
lead
surrender
indeed
and
now
came
more
tramping
and
a
pause
and
then
the
thundering
thump
of
the
and
the
little
room
was
almost
pitch
dark
we
held
it
cried
robert
we
surrender
the
sun
set
in
a
minute
here
they
all
jawing
underneath
again
pity
there
no
time
to
get
more
stones
here
pour
that
water
down
on
them
it
no
good
of
course
but
they
hate
it
oh
dear
said
jane
do
you
think
we
better
surrender
never
said
robert
we
have
a
parley
if
you
like
but
we
never
surrender
oh
i
be
a
soldier
when
i
grow
up
you
just
see
if
i
do
i
wo
go
into
the
civil
service
whatever
anyone
says
let
wave
a
handkerchief
and
ask
for
a
parley
jane
pleaded
i
believe
the
sun
going
to
set
at
all
give
them
the
water
first
the
brutes
said
the
bloodthirsty
robert
so
anthea
tilted
the
pot
over
the
nearest
and
poured
they
heard
a
splash
below
but
no
one
below
seemed
to
have
felt
it
and
again
the
ram
battered
the
great
door
anthea
paused
illustration
anthea
tilted
the
pot
over
the
nearest
how
idiotic
said
robert
lying
flat
on
the
floor
and
putting
one
eye
to
the
of
course
the
holes
go
straight
down
into
the
that
for
when
the
enemy
has
got
past
the
door
and
the
portcullis
and
almost
all
is
lost
here
hand
me
the
pot
he
crawled
on
to
the
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
and
taking
the
pot
from
anthea
poured
the
water
out
through
the
and
as
he
began
to
pour
the
noise
of
the
and
the
trampling
of
the
foe
and
the
shouts
of
surrender
and
de
talbot
for
ever
all
suddenly
stopped
and
went
out
like
the
snuff
of
a
candle
the
little
dark
room
seemed
to
whirl
round
and
turn
and
when
the
children
came
to
themselves
there
they
were
safe
and
sound
in
the
big
front
bedroom
of
their
own
house
the
house
with
the
ornamental
nightmare
to
the
roof
they
all
crowded
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
moat
and
the
tents
and
the
besieging
force
were
all
gone
and
there
was
the
garden
with
its
tangle
of
dahlias
and
marigolds
and
asters
and
later
roses
and
the
spiky
iron
railings
and
the
quiet
white
road
everyone
drew
a
deep
breath
and
that
all
right
said
robert
i
told
you
so
and
i
say
we
did
surrender
did
we
are
you
glad
now
i
wished
for
a
castle
asked
cyril
i
think
i
am
said
anthea
slowly
but
i
would
wish
for
it
again
i
think
squirrel
dear
oh
it
was
simply
splendid
said
jane
unexpectedly
i
frightened
a
bit
oh
i
say
cyril
was
beginning
but
anthea
stopped
him
look
here
she
said
it
just
come
into
my
head
this
is
the
very
first
thing
we
wished
for
that
has
got
us
into
a
row
and
there
has
been
the
least
little
scrap
of
a
row
about
this
nobody
raging
downstairs
we
safe
and
sound
we
had
an
awfully
jolly
day
at
least
not
jolly
exactly
but
you
know
what
i
mean
and
we
know
now
how
brave
robert
is
and
cyril
too
of
course
she
added
hastily
and
jane
as
well
and
we
have
got
into
a
row
with
a
single
the
door
was
opened
suddenly
and
fiercely
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
said
the
voice
of
martha
and
they
could
tell
by
her
voice
that
she
was
very
angry
indeed
i
thought
you
could
last
through
the
day
without
getting
up
to
some
mischief
a
person
ca
take
a
breath
of
air
on
the
front
doorstep
but
you
must
be
emptying
the
water
jug
on
their
heads
off
you
go
to
bed
the
lot
of
you
and
try
to
get
up
better
children
in
the
morning
now
then
let
me
have
to
tell
you
twice
if
i
find
any
of
you
not
in
bed
in
ten
minutes
i
let
you
know
it
that
all
a
new
cap
and
everything
she
flounced
out
amid
a
disregarded
chorus
of
regrets
and
apologies
the
children
were
very
sorry
but
really
it
was
not
their
faults
you
ca
help
it
if
you
are
pouring
water
on
a
besieging
foe
and
your
castle
suddenly
changes
into
your
house
and
everything
changes
with
it
except
the
water
and
that
happens
to
fall
on
somebody
else
clean
cap
i
do
know
why
the
water
did
change
into
nothing
though
said
cyril
why
should
it
asked
robert
water
water
all
the
world
over
i
expect
the
castle
well
was
the
same
as
ours
in
the
said
jane
and
that
was
really
the
case
i
thought
we
could
get
through
a
without
a
row
said
cyril
it
was
much
too
good
to
be
true
come
on
bobs
my
military
hero
if
we
lick
into
bed
sharp
she
wo
be
so
furious
and
perhaps
she
bring
us
up
some
supper
i
jolly
hungry
kids
i
hope
the
castle
wo
come
creeping
back
in
the
night
said
jane
of
course
it
wo
said
anthea
briskly
but
martha
will
not
in
the
night
but
in
a
minute
here
turn
round
i
get
that
knot
out
of
your
pinafore
strings
would
it
have
been
degrading
for
sir
wulfric
de
talbot
said
jane
dreamily
if
he
could
have
known
that
half
the
besieged
garrison
wore
pinafores
and
the
other
half
knickerbockers
yes
frightfully
do
stand
still
you
only
tightening
the
knot
said
anthea
chapter
viii
bigger
than
the
baker
boy
look
here
said
cyril
i
got
an
idea
does
it
hurt
much
said
robert
sympathetically
do
be
a
jackanape
i
not
humbugging
shut
up
bobs
said
anthea
silence
for
the
squirrel
oration
said
robert
cyril
balanced
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
in
the
backyard
where
they
all
happened
to
be
and
spoke
friends
romans
countrymen
and
women
we
found
a
sammyadd
we
have
had
wishes
we
had
wings
and
being
beautiful
as
the
day
ugh
that
was
pretty
jolly
beastly
if
you
like
and
wealth
and
castles
and
that
rotten
gipsy
business
with
the
lamb
but
we
no
forrarder
we
really
got
anything
worth
having
for
our
wishes
we
had
things
happening
said
robert
that
always
something
it
not
enough
unless
they
the
right
things
said
cyril
firmly
now
i
been
thinking
not
really
whispered
robert
in
the
silent
of
the
night
it
like
suddenly
being
asked
something
out
of
history
the
date
of
the
conquest
or
something
you
know
it
all
right
all
the
time
but
when
you
asked
it
all
goes
out
of
your
head
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
know
jolly
well
that
when
we
all
rotting
about
in
the
usual
way
heaps
of
things
keep
cropping
up
and
then
real
earnest
wishes
come
into
the
heads
of
the
beholder
hear
hear
said
of
the
beholder
however
stupid
he
is
cyril
went
on
why
even
robert
might
happen
to
think
of
a
really
useful
wish
if
he
did
injure
his
poor
little
brains
trying
so
hard
to
shut
up
bobs
i
tell
you
you
have
the
whole
show
over
a
struggle
on
the
edge
of
a
is
exciting
but
damp
when
it
was
over
and
the
boys
were
partially
dried
anthea
said
it
really
was
you
began
it
bobs
now
honour
is
satisfied
do
let
squirrel
go
on
we
wasting
the
whole
morning
well
then
said
cyril
still
wringing
the
water
out
of
the
tails
of
his
jacket
i
call
it
pax
if
bobs
will
pax
then
said
robert
sulkily
but
i
got
a
lump
as
big
as
a
cricket
ball
over
my
eye
anthea
patiently
offered
a
handkerchief
and
robert
bathed
his
wounds
in
silence
now
squirrel
she
said
well
then
let
just
play
bandits
or
forts
or
soldiers
or
any
of
the
old
games
we
dead
sure
to
think
of
something
if
we
try
not
to
you
always
do
the
others
consented
bandits
was
hastily
chosen
for
the
game
it
as
good
as
anything
else
said
jane
gloomily
it
must
be
owned
that
robert
was
at
first
but
a
bandit
but
when
anthea
had
borrowed
from
martha
the
handkerchief
in
which
the
keeper
had
brought
her
mushrooms
that
morning
and
had
tied
up
robert
head
with
it
so
that
he
could
be
the
wounded
hero
who
had
saved
the
bandit
captain
life
the
day
before
he
cheered
up
wonderfully
all
were
soon
armed
bows
and
arrows
slung
on
the
back
look
well
and
umbrellas
and
cricket
stumps
through
the
belt
give
a
fine
impression
of
the
being
armed
to
the
teeth
the
white
cotton
hats
that
men
wear
in
the
country
nowadays
have
a
very
brigandish
effect
when
a
few
feathers
are
stuck
in
them
the
lamb
was
covered
with
a
checked
and
made
an
admirable
the
lamb
asleep
inside
it
was
not
at
all
in
the
way
so
the
banditti
set
out
along
the
road
that
led
to
the
we
ought
to
be
near
the
sammyadd
said
cyril
in
case
we
think
of
anything
suddenly
it
is
all
very
well
to
make
up
your
minds
to
play
bandit
or
chess
or
or
any
other
agreeable
game
but
it
is
not
easy
to
do
it
with
spirit
when
all
the
wonderful
wishes
you
can
think
of
or
ca
think
of
are
waiting
for
you
round
the
corner
the
game
was
dragging
a
little
and
some
of
the
bandits
were
beginning
to
feel
that
the
others
were
disagreeable
things
and
were
saying
so
candidly
when
the
boy
came
along
the
road
with
loaves
in
a
basket
the
opportunity
was
not
one
to
be
lost
stand
and
deliver
cried
cyril
your
money
or
your
life
said
robert
and
they
stood
on
each
side
of
the
baker
boy
unfortunately
he
did
not
seem
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
at
all
he
was
a
boy
of
an
unusually
large
size
he
merely
said
chuck
it
now
d
hear
and
pushed
the
bandits
aside
most
disrespectfully
then
robert
lassoed
him
with
jane
and
instead
of
going
round
his
shoulders
as
robert
intended
it
went
round
his
feet
and
tripped
him
up
the
basket
was
upset
the
beautiful
new
loaves
went
bumping
and
bouncing
all
over
the
dusty
chalky
road
the
girls
ran
to
pick
them
up
and
all
in
a
moment
robert
and
the
baker
boy
were
fighting
it
out
man
to
man
with
cyril
to
see
fair
play
and
the
twisting
round
their
legs
like
an
interesting
snake
that
wished
to
be
a
it
did
not
succeed
indeed
the
way
the
boxwood
handles
sprang
up
and
hit
the
fighters
on
the
shins
and
ankles
was
not
at
all
i
know
this
is
the
second
fight
or
contest
in
this
chapter
but
i
ca
help
it
it
was
that
sort
of
day
you
know
yourself
there
are
days
when
rows
seem
to
keep
on
happening
quite
without
your
meaning
them
to
if
i
were
a
writer
of
tales
of
adventure
such
as
those
which
used
to
appear
in
boys
of
when
i
was
young
of
course
i
should
be
able
to
describe
the
fight
but
i
can
not
do
it
i
never
can
see
what
happens
during
a
fight
even
when
it
is
only
dogs
also
if
i
had
been
one
of
these
of
writers
robert
would
have
got
the
best
of
it
but
i
am
like
george
washington
i
can
not
tell
a
lie
even
about
a
much
less
about
a
fight
and
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
robert
was
badly
beaten
for
the
second
time
that
day
the
baker
boy
blacked
his
other
eye
and
being
ignorant
of
the
first
rules
of
fair
play
and
gentlemanly
behaviour
he
also
pulled
robert
hair
and
kicked
him
on
the
knee
robert
always
used
to
say
he
could
have
licked
the
baker
if
it
been
for
the
girls
but
i
am
not
sure
anyway
what
happened
was
this
and
very
painful
it
was
to
boys
illustration
he
pulled
robert
hair
cyril
was
just
tearing
off
his
coat
so
as
to
help
his
brother
in
proper
style
when
jane
threw
her
arms
round
his
legs
and
began
to
cry
and
ask
him
not
to
go
and
be
beaten
too
that
too
was
very
nice
for
robert
as
you
can
imagine
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
he
felt
when
anthea
rushed
in
between
him
and
the
baker
boy
and
caught
that
unfair
and
degraded
fighter
round
the
waist
imploring
him
not
to
fight
any
more
oh
do
hurt
my
brother
any
more
she
said
in
floods
of
tears
he
did
mean
it
it
only
play
and
i
sure
he
very
sorry
you
see
how
unfair
this
was
to
robert
because
if
the
baker
boy
had
had
any
right
and
chivalrous
instincts
and
had
yielded
to
pleading
and
accepted
her
despicable
apology
robert
could
not
in
honour
have
done
anything
to
him
at
any
future
time
but
fears
if
he
had
any
were
soon
dispelled
chivalry
was
a
stranger
to
the
breast
of
the
baker
boy
he
pushed
anthea
away
very
roughly
and
he
chased
robert
with
kicks
and
unpleasant
conversation
right
down
the
road
to
the
and
there
with
one
last
kick
he
landed
him
in
a
heap
of
sand
i
larn
you
you
young
varmint
he
said
and
went
off
to
pick
up
his
loaves
and
go
about
his
business
cyril
impeded
by
jane
could
do
nothing
without
hurting
her
for
she
clung
round
his
legs
with
the
strength
of
despair
the
baker
boy
went
off
red
and
damp
about
the
face
abusive
to
the
last
he
called
them
a
pack
of
silly
idiots
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
then
jane
grasp
loosened
cyril
turned
away
in
silent
dignity
to
follow
robert
and
the
girls
followed
him
weeping
without
restraint
it
was
not
a
happy
party
that
flung
itself
down
in
the
sand
beside
the
sobbing
robert
for
robert
was
sobbing
mostly
with
rage
though
of
course
i
know
that
a
really
heroic
boy
is
always
after
a
fight
but
then
he
always
wins
which
had
not
been
the
case
with
robert
cyril
was
angry
with
jane
robert
was
furious
with
anthea
the
girls
were
miserable
and
not
one
of
the
four
was
pleased
with
the
boy
there
was
as
french
writers
say
a
silence
full
of
emotion
then
robert
dug
his
toes
and
his
hands
into
the
sand
and
wriggled
in
his
rage
he
better
wait
till
i
grown
up
the
cowardly
brute
beast
i
hate
him
but
i
pay
him
out
just
because
he
bigger
than
me
you
began
said
jane
incautiously
i
know
i
did
silly
but
i
was
only
jollying
and
he
kicked
me
look
here
robert
tore
down
a
stocking
and
showed
a
purple
bruise
touched
up
with
red
i
only
wish
i
was
bigger
than
him
that
all
he
dug
his
fingers
in
the
sand
and
sprang
up
for
his
hand
had
touched
something
furry
it
was
the
psammead
of
course
on
the
to
make
sillies
of
them
as
usual
as
cyril
remarked
later
and
of
course
the
next
moment
robert
wish
was
granted
and
he
was
bigger
than
the
baker
boy
oh
but
much
much
bigger
he
was
bigger
than
the
big
policeman
who
used
to
be
at
the
crossing
at
the
mansion
house
years
ago
the
one
who
was
so
kind
in
helping
old
ladies
over
the
crossing
and
he
was
the
biggest
man
have
ever
seen
as
well
as
the
kindest
no
one
had
a
in
its
pocket
so
robert
could
not
be
measured
but
he
was
taller
than
your
father
would
be
if
he
stood
on
your
mother
head
which
i
am
sure
he
would
never
be
unkind
enough
to
do
he
must
have
been
ten
or
eleven
feet
high
and
as
broad
as
a
boy
of
that
height
ought
to
be
his
suit
had
fortunately
grown
too
and
now
he
stood
up
in
it
with
one
of
his
enormous
stockings
turned
down
to
show
the
gigantic
bruise
on
his
vast
leg
immense
tears
of
fury
still
stood
on
his
flushed
giant
face
he
looked
so
surprised
and
he
was
so
large
to
be
wearing
a
turned
down
collar
outside
of
his
jacket
that
the
others
could
not
help
laughing
the
sammyadd
done
us
again
said
cyril
illustration
the
sammyadd
done
us
again
said
cyril
not
us
said
robert
if
you
got
any
decent
feeling
you
try
to
make
it
make
you
the
same
size
you
no
idea
how
silly
it
feels
he
added
thoughtlessly
and
i
do
want
to
i
can
jolly
well
see
how
silly
it
looks
cyril
was
beginning
but
anthea
said
oh
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
you
boys
look
here
squirrel
let
play
fair
it
is
hateful
for
poor
old
bobs
all
alone
up
there
let
ask
the
sammyadd
for
another
wish
and
if
it
will
i
do
really
think
we
ought
all
to
be
made
the
same
size
the
others
agreed
but
not
gaily
but
when
they
found
the
psammead
it
would
not
i
it
said
crossly
rubbing
its
face
with
its
feet
he
a
rude
violent
boy
and
it
do
him
good
to
be
the
wrong
size
for
a
bit
what
did
he
want
to
come
digging
me
out
with
his
nasty
wet
hands
for
he
nearly
touched
me
he
a
perfect
savage
a
boy
of
the
stone
age
would
have
had
more
sense
robert
hands
had
indeed
been
wet
with
tears
go
away
and
leave
me
in
peace
do
the
psammead
went
on
i
think
why
you
do
wish
for
something
sensible
something
to
eat
or
drink
or
good
manners
or
good
tempers
go
along
with
you
do
it
almost
snarled
as
it
shook
its
whiskers
and
turned
a
sulky
brown
back
on
them
the
most
hopeful
felt
that
further
parley
was
vain
they
turned
again
to
the
colossal
robert
what
ever
shall
we
do
they
said
and
they
all
said
it
first
said
robert
grimly
i
going
to
reason
with
that
baker
boy
i
shall
catch
him
at
the
end
of
the
road
do
hit
a
chap
smaller
than
yourself
old
man
said
cyril
do
i
look
like
hitting
him
said
robert
scornfully
why
i
should
him
but
i
give
him
something
to
remember
wait
till
i
pull
up
my
stocking
he
pulled
up
his
stocking
which
was
as
large
as
a
small
and
strode
off
his
strides
were
six
or
seven
feet
long
so
that
it
was
quite
easy
for
him
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
ready
to
meet
the
baker
boy
when
he
came
down
swinging
the
empty
basket
to
meet
his
master
cart
which
had
been
leaving
bread
at
the
cottages
along
the
road
robert
crouched
behind
a
haystack
in
the
farmyard
that
is
at
the
corner
and
when
he
heard
the
boy
come
whistling
along
he
jumped
out
at
him
and
caught
him
by
the
collar
now
he
said
and
his
voice
was
about
four
times
its
usual
size
just
as
his
body
was
four
times
its
i
going
to
teach
you
to
kick
boys
smaller
than
you
he
lifted
up
the
baker
boy
and
set
him
on
the
top
of
the
haystack
which
was
about
sixteen
feet
from
the
ground
and
then
he
sat
down
on
the
roof
of
the
barn
and
told
the
baker
boy
exactly
what
he
thought
of
him
i
do
think
the
boy
heard
it
all
he
was
in
a
sort
of
trance
of
terror
when
robert
had
said
everything
he
could
think
of
and
some
things
twice
over
he
shook
the
boy
and
said
illustration
he
lifted
up
the
baker
boy
and
set
him
on
top
of
the
haystack
and
now
get
down
the
best
way
you
can
and
left
him
i
do
know
how
the
baker
boy
got
down
but
i
do
know
that
he
missed
the
cart
and
got
into
the
very
hottest
of
hot
water
when
he
turned
up
at
last
at
the
bakehouse
i
am
sorry
for
him
but
after
all
it
was
quite
right
that
he
should
be
taught
that
boys
must
use
their
feet
when
they
fight
but
their
fists
of
course
the
water
he
got
into
only
became
hotter
when
he
tried
to
tell
his
master
about
the
boy
he
had
licked
and
the
giant
as
high
as
a
church
because
no
one
could
possibly
believe
such
a
tale
as
that
next
day
the
tale
was
believed
but
that
was
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
to
the
baker
boy
when
robert
rejoined
the
others
he
found
them
in
the
garden
anthea
had
thoughtfully
asked
martha
to
let
them
have
dinner
out
there
because
the
was
rather
small
and
it
would
have
been
so
awkward
to
have
a
brother
the
size
of
robert
in
there
the
lamb
who
had
slept
peacefully
during
the
whole
stormy
morning
was
now
found
to
be
sneezing
and
martha
said
he
had
a
cold
and
would
be
better
indoors
and
really
it
just
as
well
said
cyril
for
i
do
believe
ever
have
stopped
screaming
if
he
once
seen
you
the
awful
size
you
are
robert
was
indeed
what
a
draper
would
call
an
in
boys
he
found
himself
able
to
step
right
over
the
iron
gate
in
the
front
garden
martha
brought
out
the
dinner
it
was
cold
veal
and
baked
potatoes
with
sago
pudding
and
stewed
plums
to
follow
she
of
course
did
not
notice
that
robert
was
anything
but
the
usual
size
and
she
gave
him
as
much
meat
and
potatoes
as
usual
and
no
more
you
have
no
idea
how
small
your
usual
helping
of
dinner
looks
when
you
are
many
times
your
proper
size
robert
groaned
and
asked
for
more
bread
but
martha
would
not
go
on
giving
more
bread
for
ever
she
was
in
a
hurry
because
the
keeper
intended
to
call
on
his
way
to
benenhurst
fair
and
she
wished
to
be
smartly
dressed
before
he
came
i
wish
were
going
to
the
fair
said
robert
you
ca
go
anywhere
that
size
said
cyril
why
not
said
robert
they
have
giants
at
fairs
much
bigger
ones
than
me
not
much
they
do
cyril
was
beginning
when
jane
screamed
oh
with
such
loud
suddenness
that
they
all
thumped
her
on
the
back
and
asked
whether
she
had
swallowed
a
no
she
said
breathless
from
being
thumped
it
it
not
a
it
an
idea
let
take
robert
to
the
fair
and
get
them
to
give
us
money
for
showing
him
then
we
really
get
something
out
of
the
old
sammyadd
at
last
take
me
indeed
said
robert
indignantly
much
more
likely
me
take
you
and
so
it
turned
out
the
idea
appealed
irresistibly
to
everyone
but
robert
and
even
he
was
brought
round
by
anthea
suggestion
that
he
should
have
a
double
share
of
any
money
they
might
make
there
was
a
little
old
in
the
the
kind
that
is
called
a
it
seemed
desirable
to
get
to
the
fair
as
quickly
as
possible
so
robert
who
could
now
take
enormous
steps
and
so
go
very
fast
indeed
consented
to
wheel
the
others
in
this
it
was
as
easy
to
him
now
as
wheeling
the
lamb
in
the
had
been
in
the
morning
the
lamb
cold
prevented
his
being
of
the
party
it
was
a
strange
sensation
being
wheeled
in
a
by
a
giant
everyone
enjoyed
the
journey
except
robert
and
the
few
people
they
passed
on
the
way
these
mostly
went
into
what
looked
like
some
kind
of
fits
by
the
roadside
as
anthea
said
just
outside
benenhurst
robert
hid
in
a
barn
and
the
others
went
on
to
the
fair
illustration
it
was
a
strange
sensation
being
wheeled
in
a
by
a
giant
there
were
some
swings
and
a
blaring
and
a
and
aunt
sallies
resisting
an
impulse
to
win
a
cocoanut
or
at
least
to
attempt
the
enterprise
cyril
went
up
to
the
woman
who
was
loading
little
guns
before
the
array
of
glass
bottles
on
strings
against
a
sheet
of
canvas
here
you
are
little
gentleman
she
said
penny
a
shot
no
thank
you
said
cyril
we
are
here
on
business
not
on
pleasure
who
the
master
the
what
the
master
the
head
the
boss
of
the
show
over
there
she
said
pointing
to
a
stout
man
in
a
dirty
linen
jacket
who
was
sleeping
in
the
sun
but
i
do
advise
you
to
wake
him
sudden
his
temper
contrairy
especially
these
hot
days
better
have
a
shot
while
you
waiting
it
rather
important
said
cyril
it
be
very
profitable
to
him
i
think
he
be
sorry
if
we
take
it
away
oh
if
it
money
in
his
pocket
said
the
woman
no
kid
now
what
is
it
it
a
you
kidding
come
along
and
see
said
anthea
the
woman
looked
doubtfully
at
them
then
she
called
to
a
ragged
little
girl
in
striped
stockings
and
a
dingy
white
petticoat
that
came
below
her
brown
frock
and
leaving
her
in
charge
of
the
she
turned
to
anthea
and
said
well
hurry
up
but
if
you
kidding
you
best
say
so
i
as
mild
as
milk
myself
but
my
bill
he
a
fair
terror
and
anthea
led
the
way
to
the
barn
it
really
a
giant
she
said
he
a
giant
little
boy
in
a
suit
like
my
brother
there
and
we
did
bring
him
up
to
the
fair
because
people
do
stare
so
and
they
seem
to
go
into
kind
of
fits
when
they
see
him
and
we
thought
perhaps
you
like
to
show
him
and
get
pennies
and
if
you
like
to
pay
us
something
you
can
only
it
have
to
be
rather
a
lot
because
we
promised
him
he
should
have
a
double
share
of
whatever
we
made
the
woman
murmured
something
indistinct
of
which
the
children
could
only
hear
the
words
swelp
me
balmy
and
crumpet
which
conveyed
no
definite
idea
to
their
minds
she
had
taken
anthea
hand
and
was
holding
it
very
firmly
and
anthea
could
not
help
wondering
what
would
happen
if
robert
should
have
wandered
off
or
turned
his
proper
size
during
the
interval
but
she
knew
that
the
psammead
gifts
really
did
last
till
sunset
however
inconvenient
their
lasting
might
be
and
she
did
not
think
somehow
that
robert
would
care
to
go
out
alone
while
he
was
that
size
when
they
reached
the
barn
and
cyril
called
robert
there
was
a
stir
among
the
loose
hay
and
robert
began
to
come
out
his
hand
and
arm
came
first
then
a
foot
and
leg
when
the
woman
saw
the
hand
she
said
my
but
when
she
saw
the
foot
she
said
upon
my
word
and
when
by
slow
and
heavy
degrees
the
whole
of
robert
enormous
bulk
was
at
last
disclosed
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
began
to
say
many
things
compared
with
which
balmy
and
crumpet
seemed
quite
ordinary
she
dropped
into
understandable
english
at
last
what
you
take
for
him
she
said
excitedly
anything
in
reason
we
have
a
special
van
built
leastways
i
know
where
there
a
one
would
do
up
handsome
what
a
baby
elephant
had
as
died
what
you
take
he
soft
ai
he
them
giants
mostly
is
but
i
never
see
no
never
what
you
take
down
on
the
nail
we
treat
him
like
a
king
and
give
him
grub
and
a
doss
fit
for
a
bloomin
dook
he
must
be
dotty
or
he
would
need
you
kids
to
cart
him
about
what
you
take
for
him
they
wo
take
anything
said
robert
sternly
i
no
more
soft
than
you
are
not
so
much
i
should
wonder
i
come
and
be
a
show
for
if
you
give
me
he
hesitated
at
the
enormous
price
he
was
about
to
ask
if
you
give
me
fifteen
shillings
done
said
the
woman
so
quickly
that
robert
felt
he
had
been
unfair
to
himself
and
wished
he
had
asked
thirty
come
on
now
and
see
my
bill
and
we
fix
a
price
for
the
season
i
dessay
you
might
get
as
much
as
two
pounds
a
week
come
on
and
make
yourself
as
small
as
you
can
for
gracious
sake
this
was
not
very
small
and
a
crowd
gathered
quickly
so
that
it
was
at
the
head
of
an
enthusiastic
procession
that
robert
entered
the
trampled
meadow
where
the
fair
was
held
and
passed
over
the
stubby
yellow
dusty
grass
to
the
door
of
the
biggest
tent
he
crept
in
and
the
woman
went
to
call
her
bill
he
was
the
big
sleeping
man
and
he
did
not
seem
at
all
pleased
at
being
awakened
cyril
watching
through
a
slit
in
the
tent
saw
him
scowl
and
shake
a
heavy
fist
and
a
sleepy
head
then
the
woman
went
on
speaking
very
fast
cyril
heard
strewth
and
biggest
draw
you
ever
so
help
me
and
he
began
to
share
robert
feeling
that
fifteen
shillings
was
indeed
far
too
little
bill
slouched
up
to
the
tent
and
entered
when
he
beheld
the
magnificent
proportions
of
robert
he
said
but
little
strike
me
pink
were
the
only
words
the
children
could
afterwards
remember
but
he
produced
fifteen
shillings
mainly
in
sixpences
and
coppers
and
handed
it
to
robert
we
fix
up
about
what
you
to
draw
when
the
show
over
he
said
with
hoarse
heartiness
lor
love
a
duck
you
be
that
happy
with
us
you
never
want
to
leave
us
can
you
do
a
song
now
or
a
bit
of
a
breakdown
not
said
robert
rejecting
the
idea
of
trying
to
sing
as
once
in
may
a
favourite
of
his
mother
and
the
only
song
he
could
think
of
at
the
moment
get
levi
and
clear
them
bloomin
photos
out
clear
the
tent
stick
out
a
curtain
or
suthink
the
man
went
on
lor
what
a
pity
we
ai
got
no
tights
his
size
but
we
have
before
the
week
out
young
man
your
fortune
made
it
a
good
thing
you
came
to
me
and
not
to
some
chaps
as
i
could
tell
you
on
i
known
blokes
as
beat
their
giants
and
starved
too
so
i
tell
you
straight
you
in
luck
this
day
if
you
never
was
afore
i
a
lamb
i
am
and
i
do
deceive
you
i
not
afraid
of
anyone
beating
me
said
robert
looking
down
on
the
lamb
robert
was
crouched
on
his
knees
because
the
tent
was
not
big
enough
for
him
to
stand
upright
in
but
even
in
that
position
he
could
still
look
down
on
most
people
but
i
awfully
hungry
i
wish
get
me
something
to
eat
here
said
the
hoarse
bill
get
him
some
grub
the
best
you
got
mind
another
whisper
followed
of
which
the
children
only
heard
down
in
black
and
white
first
thing
then
the
woman
went
to
get
the
food
it
was
only
bread
and
cheese
when
it
came
but
it
was
delightful
to
the
large
and
empty
robert
and
the
man
went
to
post
sentinels
round
the
tent
to
give
the
alarm
if
robert
should
attempt
to
escape
with
his
fifteen
shillings
as
if
we
were
honest
said
anthea
indignantly
when
the
meaning
of
the
sentinels
dawned
on
her
then
began
a
very
strange
and
wonderful
afternoon
bill
was
a
man
who
knew
his
business
in
a
very
little
while
the
photographic
views
the
spyglasses
you
look
at
them
through
so
that
they
really
seem
rather
real
and
the
lights
you
see
them
by
were
all
packed
away
a
curtain
it
was
an
old
carpet
really
was
run
across
the
tent
robert
was
concealed
behind
and
bill
was
standing
on
a
outside
the
tent
making
a
speech
it
was
rather
a
good
speech
it
began
by
saying
that
the
giant
it
was
his
privilege
to
introduce
to
the
public
that
day
was
the
eldest
son
of
the
emperor
of
san
francisco
compelled
through
an
unfortunate
love
affair
with
the
duchess
of
the
fiji
islands
to
leave
his
own
country
and
take
refuge
in
england
the
land
of
liberty
where
freedom
was
the
right
of
every
man
no
matter
how
big
he
was
it
ended
by
the
announcement
that
the
first
twenty
who
came
to
the
tent
door
should
see
the
giant
for
threepence
apiece
after
that
said
bill
the
price
is
riz
and
i
undertake
to
say
what
it
wo
be
riz
to
so
now
yer
time
a
young
man
with
his
sweetheart
on
her
afternoon
out
was
the
first
to
come
forward
for
this
occasion
his
was
the
princely
attitude
no
expense
spared
money
no
object
his
girl
wished
to
see
the
giant
well
she
should
see
the
giant
even
though
seeing
the
giant
cost
threepence
each
and
the
other
entertainments
were
all
penny
ones
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
raised
the
couple
entered
next
moment
a
wild
shriek
from
the
girl
thrilled
through
all
present
bill
slapped
his
leg
that
done
the
trick
he
whispered
to
it
was
indeed
a
splendid
advertisement
of
the
charms
of
robert
when
the
young
girl
came
out
she
was
pale
and
trembling
and
a
crowd
was
round
the
tent
illustration
when
the
girl
came
out
she
was
pale
and
trembling
what
was
it
like
asked
a
oh
horrid
you
would
believe
she
said
it
as
big
as
a
barn
and
that
fierce
it
froze
the
blood
in
my
bones
i
would
ha
missed
seeing
it
for
anything
the
fierceness
was
only
caused
by
robert
trying
not
to
laugh
but
the
desire
to
do
that
soon
left
him
and
before
sunset
he
was
more
inclined
to
cry
than
laugh
and
more
inclined
to
sleep
than
either
for
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
people
kept
coming
in
all
the
afternoon
and
robert
had
to
shake
hands
with
those
who
wished
it
and
to
allow
himself
to
be
punched
and
pulled
and
patted
and
thumped
so
that
people
might
make
sure
he
was
really
real
the
other
children
sat
on
a
bench
and
watched
and
waited
and
were
very
bored
indeed
it
seemed
to
them
that
this
was
the
hardest
way
of
earning
money
that
could
have
been
invented
and
only
fifteen
shillings
bill
had
taken
four
times
that
already
for
the
news
of
the
giant
had
spread
and
in
carts
and
gentlepeople
in
carriages
came
from
far
and
near
one
gentleman
with
an
eyeglass
and
a
very
large
yellow
rose
in
his
buttonhole
offered
robert
in
an
obliging
whisper
ten
pounds
a
week
to
appear
at
the
crystal
palace
robert
had
to
say
no
i
ca
he
said
regretfully
it
no
use
promising
what
you
do
ah
poor
fellow
bound
for
a
term
of
years
i
suppose
well
here
my
card
when
your
time
up
come
to
me
illustration
when
your
time
up
come
to
me
i
will
if
i
the
same
size
then
said
robert
truthfully
if
you
grow
a
bit
so
much
the
better
said
the
gentleman
when
he
had
gone
robert
beckoned
cyril
and
said
tell
them
i
must
and
will
have
a
rest
and
i
want
my
tea
tea
was
provided
and
a
paper
hastily
pinned
on
the
tent
it
said
closed
for
half
an
hour
while
the
giant
gets
his
tea
then
there
was
a
hurried
council
how
am
i
to
get
away
said
robert
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
the
afternoon
why
walk
out
when
the
sun
sets
and
you
your
right
size
they
do
anything
to
us
robert
opened
his
eyes
why
they
nearly
kill
us
he
said
when
they
saw
me
get
my
right
size
no
we
must
think
of
some
other
way
we
be
alone
when
the
sun
sets
i
know
said
cyril
briskly
and
he
went
to
the
door
outside
which
bill
was
smoking
a
clay
pipe
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
cyril
heard
him
say
good
as
havin
a
fortune
left
you
look
here
said
cyril
you
can
let
people
come
in
again
in
a
minute
he
nearly
finished
tea
but
he
be
left
alone
when
the
sun
sets
he
very
queer
at
that
time
of
day
and
if
he
worried
i
wo
answer
for
the
consequences
why
what
comes
over
him
asked
bill
i
do
know
it
it
sort
of
a
said
cyril
candidly
he
is
at
all
like
himself
you
hardly
know
him
he
very
queer
indeed
someone
get
hurt
if
he
not
alone
about
sunset
this
was
true
he
pull
round
for
the
evening
i
oh
yes
half
an
hour
after
sunset
he
be
quite
himself
again
best
humour
him
said
the
woman
and
so
at
what
cyril
judged
was
about
half
an
hour
before
sunset
the
tent
was
again
closed
whilst
the
giant
gets
his
supper
the
crowd
was
very
merry
about
the
giant
meals
and
their
coming
so
close
together
well
he
can
pick
a
bit
bill
owned
you
see
he
has
to
eat
hearty
being
the
size
he
is
inside
the
tent
the
four
children
breathlessly
arranged
a
plan
of
retreat
you
go
said
cyril
to
the
girls
and
get
along
home
as
fast
as
you
can
oh
never
mind
the
we
get
that
robert
and
i
are
dressed

same

manage
somehow
like
sydney

run
but
you
ca
whatever
you
may
think
no
jane
it
no
good
robert
going
out
and
knocking
people
down
the
police
would
follow
him
till
he
turned
his
proper
size
and
then
arrest
him
like
a
shot
go
you
must
if
you
do
i
never
speak
to
you

it
was
you

bill

the
giant

you

kind
to
him
and
that
as
anthea
said
afterwards
was
very
deceitful
but
what
were
they
to
do
when
they
had
gone
cyril
went
to
bill
look
here
he
said
he
wants
some
ears
of
corn
there
some
in
the
next
field
but
one
i
just
run
and
get
it
oh

he
says

bit

says
he
stifling

a
breath
of
air
i
see
no
one
peeps
in
at
him
i
cover
him
up
and
he
can
take
a
nap
while
i
go
for
the
corn
he
have
it
there
no
holding
him
when
he
gets
like

the
giant
was
made
comfortable
with
a
heap
of
sacks
and
an
old
tarpaulin
the
curtain
was
looped
up
and
the
brothers
were
left
alone
they
matured
their
plan
in
whispers
outside
the
blared
out
its
comic
tunes
screaming
now
and
then
to
attract
public
notice
half
a
minute
after
the
sun
had
set
a
boy
came
out
past
bill
i
off
for
the
corn
he
said
and
mingled
quickly
with
the
crowd
at
the
same
instant
a
boy
came
out
of
the
back
of
the
tent
past
posted
there
as
sentinel
i
off
after
the
corn
said
this
boy
also
and
he
too
moved
away
quietly
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
the
boy
was
cyril
the
was
robert
now
since
sunset
once
more
his
proper
size
they
walked
quickly
through
the
field
along
the
road
where
robert
caught
cyril
up
then
they
ran
they
were
home
as
soon
as
the
girls
were
for
it
was
a
long
way
and
they
ran
most
of
it
it
was
indeed
a
long
way
as
they
found
when
they
had
to
go
and
drag
the
home
next
morning
with
no
enormous
robert
to
wheel
them
in
it
as
if
it
were
a
and
they
were
babies
and
he
was
their
gigantic
nursemaid
i
can
not
possibly
tell
you
what
bill
and
said
when
they
found
that
the
giant
had
gone
for
one
thing
i
do
not
know
chapter
ix
grown
up
cyril
had
once
pointed
out
that
ordinary
life
is
full
of
occasions
on
which
a
wish
would
be
most
useful
and
this
thought
filled
his
mind
when
he
happened
to
wake
early
on
the
morning
after
the
morning
after
robert
had
wished
to
be
bigger
than
the
baker
boy
and
had
been
it
the
day
that
lay
between
these
two
days
had
been
occupied
entirely
by
getting
the
home
from
benenhurst
cyril
dressed
hastily
he
did
not
take
a
bath
because
tin
baths
are
so
noisy
and
he
had
no
wish
to
rouse
robert
and
he
slipped
off
alone
as
anthea
had
once
done
and
ran
through
the
dewy
morning
to
the
he
dug
up
the
psammead
very
carefully
and
kindly
and
began
the
conversation
by
asking
it
whether
it
still
felt
any
ill
effects
from
the
contact
with
the
tears
of
robert
the
day
before
yesterday
the
psammead
was
in
good
temper
it
replied
politely
and
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
it
said
i
suppose
you
come
here
so
early
to
ask
for
something
for
yourself
something
your
brothers
and
sisters
are
to
know
about
eh
now
do
be
persuaded
for
your
own
good
ask
for
a
good
fat
megatherium
and
have
done
with
it
thank
you
not
i
think
said
cyril
cautiously
what
i
really
wanted
to
say
was
you
know
how
you
always
wishing
for
things
when
you
playing
at
anything
i
seldom
play
said
the
psammead
coldly
well
you
know
what
i
mean
cyril
went
on
impatiently
what
i
want
to
say
is
wo
you
let
us
have
our
wish
just
when
we
think
of
it
and
just
where
we
happen
to
be
so
that
we
do
have
to
come
and
disturb
you
again
added
the
crafty
cyril
it
only
end
in
your
wishing
for
something
you
do
really
want
as
you
did
about
the
castle
said
the
psammead
stretching
its
brown
arms
and
yawning
it
always
the
same
since
people
left
off
eating
really
wholesome
things
however
have
it
your
own
way
said
cyril
politely
i
tell
you
what
said
the
psammead
suddenly
shooting
out
its
long
snail
eyes
i
getting
tired
of
you
all
of
you
you
have
no
more
sense
than
so
many
oysters
go
along
with
you
and
cyril
went
what
an
awful
long
time
babies
babies
said
cyril
after
the
lamb
had
taken
his
watch
out
of
his
pocket
while
he
was
noticing
and
with
coos
and
clucks
of
naughty
rapture
had
opened
the
case
and
used
the
whole
thing
as
a
garden
spade
and
when
even
immersion
in
a
wash
basin
had
failed
to
wash
the
mould
from
the
works
and
make
the
watch
go
again
cyril
had
said
several
things
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
but
now
he
was
calmer
and
had
even
consented
to
carry
the
lamb
part
of
the
way
to
the
woods
cyril
had
persuaded
the
others
to
agree
to
his
plan
and
not
to
wish
for
anything
more
till
they
really
did
wish
it
meantime
it
seemed
good
to
go
to
the
woods
for
nuts
and
on
the
mossy
grass
under
a
sweet
chestnut
tree
the
five
were
sitting
the
lamb
was
pulling
up
the
moss
by
fat
handfuls
and
cyril
was
gloomily
contemplating
the
ruins
of
his
watch
illustration
he
opened
the
case
and
used
the
whole
thing
as
a
garden
spade
he
does
grow
said
anthea
does
precious
me
grow
said
the
lamb
cheerfully
me
grow
big
boy
have
guns
mouses
an
an
imagination
or
vocabulary
gave
out
here
but
anyway
it
was
the
longest
speech
the
lamb
had
ever
made
and
it
charmed
everyone
even
cyril
who
tumbled
the
lamb
over
and
rolled
him
in
the
moss
to
the
music
of
delighted
squeals
i
suppose
he
be
grown
up
some
day
anthea
was
saying
dreamily
looking
up
at
the
blue
of
the
sky
that
showed
between
the
long
straight
but
at
that
moment
the
lamb
struggling
gaily
with
cyril
thrust
a
little
foot
against
his
brother
chest
there
was
a
crack
the
innocent
lamb
had
broken
the
glass
of
waterbury
watch
which
cyril
had
borrowed
without
leave
grow
up
some
day
said
cyril
bitterly
plumping
the
lamb
down
on
the
grass
i
daresay
he
will
when
nobody
wants
him
to
i
wish
to
goodness
he
would
take
care
cried
anthea
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
but
it
was
too
late
like
music
to
a
song
her
words
and
cyril
came
out
together
anthea
oh
take
care
cyril
grow
up
now
the
faithful
psammead
was
true
to
its
promise
and
there
before
the
horrified
eyes
of
its
brothers
and
sisters
the
lamb
suddenly
and
violently
grew
up
it
was
the
most
terrible
moment
the
change
was
not
so
sudden
as
the
usually
were
the
baby
face
changed
first
it
grew
thinner
and
larger
lines
came
in
the
forehead
the
eyes
grew
more
and
darker
in
colour
the
mouth
grew
longer
and
thinner
most
terrible
of
all
a
little
dark
mustache
appeared
on
the
lip
of
one
who
was
still
except
as
to
the
face
a
baby
in
a
linen
smock
and
white
socks
oh
i
wish
it
would
oh
i
wish
it
would
you
boys
might
wish
as
well
they
all
wished
hard
for
the
sight
was
enough
to
dismay
the
most
heartless
they
all
wished
so
hard
indeed
that
they
felt
quite
giddy
and
almost
lost
consciousness
but
the
wishing
was
quite
vain
for
when
the
wood
ceased
to
whirl
round
their
dazed
eyes
were
riveted
at
once
by
the
spectacle
of
a
very
young
man
in
flannels
and
a
straw
hat
a
young
man
who
wore
the
same
little
black
mustache
which
just
before
they
had
actually
seen
growing
upon
the
baby
lip
this
then
was
the
lamb
grown
up
their
own
lamb
it
was
a
terrible
moment
the
lamb
moved
gracefully
across
the
moss
and
settled
himself
against
the
trunk
of
the
sweet
chestnut
he
tilted
the
straw
hat
over
his
eyes
he
was
evidently
weary
he
was
going
to
sleep
the
lamb
the
original
little
tiresome
beloved
lamb
often
went
to
sleep
at
odd
times
and
in
unexpected
places
was
this
new
lamb
in
the
grey
flannel
suit
and
the
pale
green
necktie
like
the
other
lamb
or
had
his
mind
grown
up
together
with
his
body
that
was
the
question
which
the
others
in
a
hurried
council
held
among
the
yellowing
a
few
yards
from
the
sleeper
debated
eagerly
whichever
it
is
it
be
just
as
awful
said
anthea
if
his
inside
senses
are
grown
up
too
he
wo
stand
our
looking
after
him
and
if
he
still
a
baby
inside
of
him
how
on
earth
are
we
to
get
him
to
do
anything
and
it
be
getting
on
for
in
a
minute
and
we
have
got
any
nuts
said
jane
oh
bother
nuts
said
robert
but
dinner
different
i
did
have
half
enough
dinner
yesterday
could
we
tie
him
to
the
tree
and
go
home
to
our
dinner
and
come
back
afterwards
a
fat
lot
of
dinner
we
should
get
if
we
went
back
without
the
lamb
said
cyril
in
scornful
misery
and
it
be
just
the
same
if
we
go
back
with
him
in
the
state
he
is
now
yes
i
know
it
my
doing
do
rub
it
in
i
know
i
a
beast
and
not
fit
to
live
you
can
take
that
for
settled
and
say
no
more
about
it
the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
let
wake
him
up
and
take
him
into
rochester
or
maidstone
and
get
something
to
eat
at
a
baker
shop
said
robert
hopefully
take
him
repeated
cyril
yes
do
it
all
my
fault
i
do
deny
that
but
you
find
you
got
your
work
cut
out
for
you
if
you
try
to
take
that
young
man
anywhere
the
lamb
always
was
spoilt
but
now
grown
up
he
a
demon
simply
i
can
see
it
look
at
his
mouth
well
then
said
robert
let
wake
him
up
and
see
what
do
perhaps
take
to
maidstone
and
stand
treat
he
ought
to
have
a
lot
of
money
in
the
pockets
of
those
pants
we
have
dinner
anyway
they
drew
lots
with
little
bits
of
brake
fern
it
fell
to
jane
lot
to
waken
the
lamb
she
did
it
gently
by
tickling
his
nose
with
a
twig
of
honeysuckle
he
said
bother
the
flies
twice
and
then
opened
his
eyes
illustration
she
did
it
gently
by
tickling
his
nose
with
a
twig
of
honeysuckle
hullo
kiddies
he
said
in
a
languid
tone
still
here
what
the
giddy
hour
you
be
late
for
your
grub
i
know
we
shall
said
robert
bitterly
then
cut
along
home
said
the
lamb
what
about
your
grub
though
asked
jane
oh
how
far
is
it
to
the
station
do
you
think
i
a
sort
of
a
notion
that
i
run
up
to
town
and
have
some
lunch
at
the
club
blank
misery
fell
like
a
pall
on
the
four
others
the
lamb
alone
unattended
would
go
to
town
and
have
lunch
at
a
club
perhaps
he
would
also
have
tea
there
perhaps
sunset
would
come
upon
him
amid
the
dazzling
luxury
of
and
a
helpless
cross
sleepy
baby
would
find
itself
alone
amid
unsympathetic
waiters
and
would
wail
miserably
for
panty
from
the
depths
of
a
club
the
picture
moved
anthea
almost
to
tears
oh
no
lamb
ducky
you
must
do
that
she
cried
incautiously
the
lamb
frowned
my
dear
anthea
he
said
how
often
am
i
to
tell
you
that
my
name
is
hilary
or
maur
or
devereux
any
of
my
baptismal
names
are
free
to
my
little
brothers
and
sisters
but
a
relic
of
foolishness
and
childhood
this
was
awful
he
was
their
elder
brother
now
was
he
well
of
course
he
was
if
he
was
since
they
were
thus
in
whispers
anthea
and
robert
but
the
almost
daily
adventures
resulting
from
the
psammead
wishes
were
making
the
children
wise
beyond
their
years
dear
hilary
said
anthea
and
the
others
choked
at
the
name
you
know
father
did
wish
you
to
go
to
london
he
would
like
us
to
be
left
alone
without
you
to
take
care
of
us
oh
deceitful
thing
that
i
am
she
added
to
herself
look
here
said
cyril
if
you
our
elder
brother
why
not
behave
as
sich
and
take
us
over
to
maidstone
and
give
us
a
jolly
good
and
we
go
on
the
river
afterwards
i
infinitely
obliged
to
you
said
the
lamb
courteously
but
i
should
prefer
solitude
go
home
to
your
lunch
i
mean
your
dinner
perhaps
i
may
look
in
about
or
i
may
not
be
home
till
after
you
are
in
your
beds
their
beds
speaking
glances
flashed
between
the
wretched
four
much
bed
there
would
be
for
them
if
they
went
home
without
the
lamb
we
promised
mother
not
to
lose
sight
of
you
if
we
took
you
out
jane
said
before
the
others
could
stop
her
look
here
jane
said
the
lamb
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
looking
down
at
her
little
girls
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
you
kids
must
learn
not
to
make
yourselves
a
nuisance
run
along
home
now
and
perhaps
if
you
good
i
give
you
each
a
penny
look
here
said
cyril
in
the
best
man
to
man
tone
at
his
command
where
are
you
going
old
man
you
might
let
bobs
and
me
come
with
you
even
if
you
do
want
the
girls
this
was
really
rather
noble
of
cyril
for
he
never
did
care
much
about
being
seen
in
public
with
the
lamb
who
of
course
after
sunset
would
be
a
baby
again
the
man
to
man
tone
succeeded
i
shall
run
over
to
maidstone
on
my
bike
said
the
new
lamb
airily
fingering
the
little
black
mustache
i
can
lunch
at
the
crown
and
perhaps
i
have
a
pull
on
the
river
but
i
ca
take
you
all
on
the
machine
now
can
i
run
along
home
like
good
children
the
position
was
desperate
robert
exchanged
a
despairing
look
with
cyril
anthea
detached
a
pin
from
her
waistband
a
pin
whose
withdrawal
left
a
gaping
chasm
between
skirt
and
bodice
and
handed
it
furtively
to
robert
with
a
grimace
of
the
darkest
and
deepest
meaning
robert
slipped
away
to
the
road
there
sure
enough
stood
a
bicycle
a
beautiful
new
one
of
course
robert
understood
at
once
that
if
the
lamb
was
grown
up
he
have
a
bicycle
illustration
there
sure
enough
stood
a
bicycle
this
had
always
been
one
of
robert
own
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
he
hastily
began
to
use
the
pin
eleven
punctures
in
the
back
tyre
seven
in
the
front
he
would
have
made
the
total
but
for
the
rustling
of
the
yellow
which
warned
him
of
the
approach
of
the
others
he
hastily
leaned
a
hand
on
each
wheel
and
was
rewarded
by
the
whish
of
the
what
was
left
of
air
escaping
from
eighteen
neat
your
bike
run
down
said
robert
wondering
how
he
could
so
soon
have
learned
to
deceive
so
it
is
said
cyril
it
a
puncture
said
anthea
stooping
down
and
standing
up
again
with
a
thorn
which
she
had
got
ready
for
the
purpose
look
here
the
lamb
or
hilary
as
i
suppose
one
must
now
call
him
fixed
his
pump
and
blew
up
the
tyre
the
punctured
state
of
it
was
soon
evident
illustration
the
punctured
state
of
it
was
soon
evident
i
suppose
there
a
cottage
somewhere
near
where
one
could
get
a
pail
of
water
said
the
lamb
there
was
and
when
the
number
of
punctures
had
been
made
manifest
it
was
felt
to
be
a
special
blessing
that
the
cottage
provided
teas
for
cyclists
it
provided
an
odd
sort
of
meal
for
the
lamb
and
his
brothers
this
was
paid
for
out
of
the
fifteen
shillings
which
had
been
earned
by
robert
when
he
was
a
giant
for
the
lamb
it
appeared
had
unfortunately
no
money
about
him
this
was
a
great
disappointment
for
the
others
but
it
is
a
thing
that
will
happen
even
to
the
most
of
us
however
robert
had
enough
to
eat
and
that
was
something
quietly
but
persistently
the
miserable
four
took
it
in
turns
to
try
and
persuade
the
lamb
or
maur
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
in
the
woods
there
was
not
very
much
of
the
day
left
by
the
time
he
had
mended
the
eighteenth
puncture
he
looked
up
from
the
completed
work
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
suddenly
put
his
tie
straight
there
a
lady
coming
he
said
briskly
for
goodness
sake
get
out
of
the
way
go
home
hide
vanish
somehow
i
ca
be
seen
with
a
pack
of
dirty
kids
his
brothers
and
sisters
were
indeed
rather
dirty
because
earlier
in
the
day
the
lamb
in
his
infant
state
had
sprinkled
a
good
deal
of
garden
soil
over
them
the
voice
was
so
as
jane
said
afterwards
that
they
actually
retreated
to
the
back
garden
and
left
him
with
his
little
mustache
and
his
flannel
suit
to
meet
alone
the
young
lady
who
now
came
up
the
front
garden
wheeling
a
bicycle
the
woman
of
the
house
came
out
and
the
young
lady
spoke
to
her
the
lamb
raised
his
hat
as
she
passed
him
and
the
children
could
not
hear
what
she
said
though
they
were
craning
round
the
corner
and
listening
with
all
their
ears
they
felt
it
to
be
perfectly
fair
as
robert
said
with
that
wretched
lamb
in
that
condition
when
the
lamb
spoke
in
a
languid
voice
heavy
with
politeness
they
heard
well
enough
a
puncture
he
was
saying
can
i
not
be
of
any
assistance
if
you
could
allow
me
there
was
a
stifled
explosion
of
laughter
and
the
lamb
otherwise
devereux
turned
the
tail
of
an
angry
eye
in
its
direction
you
very
kind
said
the
lady
looking
at
the
lamb
she
looked
rather
shy
but
as
the
boys
put
it
there
did
seem
to
be
any
nonsense
about
her
but
oh
whispered
cyril
i
should
have
thought
he
had
enough
for
one
day
and
if
she
only
knew
that
really
and
truly
he
only
a
silly
little
baby
he
anthea
murmured
angrily
he
a
dear
if
people
only
let
him
alone
it
our
own
precious
lamb
still
whatever
silly
idiots
may
turn
him
into
is
he
pussy
jane
doubtfully
supposed
so
now
the
lamb
whom
i
must
try
to
remember
to
call
maur
was
examining
the
lady
bicycle
and
talking
to
her
with
a
very
manner
indeed
no
one
could
possibly
have
supposed
to
see
and
hear
him
that
only
that
very
morning
he
had
been
a
chubby
child
of
two
years
breaking
other
people
waterbury
watches
devereux
as
he
ought
to
be
called
for
the
future
took
out
a
gold
watch
when
he
had
mended
the
lady
bicycle
and
all
the
hidden
onlookers
said
oh
because
it
seemed
so
unfair
that
the
baby
who
had
only
that
morning
destroyed
two
cheap
but
honest
watches
should
now
in
the
to
which
cyril
folly
had
raised
him
have
a
real
gold
watch
with
a
chain
and
seals
hilary
as
i
will
now
term
him
withered
his
brothers
and
sisters
with
a
glance
and
then
said
to
the
lady
with
whom
he
seemed
to
be
quite
friendly
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
ride
with
you
as
far
as
the
cross
roads
it
is
getting
late
and
there
are
tramps
about
no
one
will
ever
know
what
answer
the
young
lady
intended
to
give
to
this
gallant
offer
for
directly
anthea
heard
it
made
she
rushed
out
knocking
against
a
swill
pail
which
overflowed
in
a
turbid
stream
and
caught
the
lamb
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
hilary
by
the
arm
the
others
followed
and
in
an
instant
the
four
dirty
children
were
visible
beyond
disguise
do
let
him
said
anthea
to
the
lady
and
she
spoke
with
intense
earnestness
he
not
fit
to
go
with
anyone
go
away
little
girl
said
maur
as
we
will
now
call
him
in
a
terrible
voice
go
home
at
once
you
much
better
not
have
anything
to
do
with
him
the
now
reckless
anthea
went
on
he
does
know
who
he
is
he
something
very
different
from
what
you
think
he
is
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
lady
not
unnaturally
while
devereux
as
i
must
term
the
lamb
tried
vainly
to
push
anthea
away
the
others
backed
her
up
and
she
stood
solid
as
a
rock
you
just
let
him
go
with
you
said
anthea
you
soon
see
what
i
mean
how
would
you
like
to
suddenly
see
a
poor
little
helpless
baby
spinning
along
downhill
beside
you
with
its
feet
up
on
a
bicycle
it
had
lost
control
of
the
lady
had
turned
rather
pale
who
are
these
very
dirty
children
she
asked
the
lamb
sometimes
called
maur
in
these
pages
i
do
know
he
lied
miserably
oh
lamb
how
you
cried
jane
when
you
know
perfectly
well
you
our
own
little
baby
brother
that
we
so
fond
of
we
his
big
brothers
and
sisters
she
explained
turning
to
the
lady
who
with
trembling
hands
was
now
turning
her
bicycle
towards
the
gate
and
got
to
take
care
of
him
and
we
must
get
him
home
before
sunset
or
i
do
know
whatever
will
become
of
us
you
see
he
sort
of
under
a
spell
enchanted
you
know
what
i
mean
again
and
again
the
lamb
devereux
i
mean
had
tried
to
stop
eloquence
but
robert
and
cyril
held
him
one
by
each
leg
and
no
proper
explanation
was
possible
the
lady
rode
hastily
away
and
electrified
her
relatives
at
dinner
by
telling
them
of
her
escape
from
a
family
of
dangerous
lunatics
the
little
girl
eyes
were
simply
those
of
a
maniac
i
ca
think
how
she
came
to
be
at
large
she
said
when
her
bicycle
had
whizzed
away
down
the
road
cyril
spoke
gravely
hilary
old
chap
he
said
you
must
have
had
a
sunstroke
or
something
and
the
things
you
been
saying
to
that
lady
why
if
we
were
to
tell
you
the
things
you
said
when
you
are
yourself
again
say
morning
you
would
ever
understand
them
let
alone
believe
them
you
trust
to
me
old
chap
and
come
home
now
and
if
you
not
yourself
in
the
morning
we
ask
the
milkman
to
ask
the
doctor
to
come
the
poor
lamb
maur
was
really
one
of
his
christian
names
seemed
now
too
bewildered
to
resist
since
you
seem
all
to
be
as
mad
as
the
whole
worshipful
company
of
hatters
he
said
bitterly
i
suppose
i
better
take
you
home
but
you
not
to
suppose
i
shall
pass
this
over
i
shall
have
something
to
say
to
you
all
morning
yes
you
will
my
lamb
said
anthea
under
her
breath
but
it
wo
be
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
you
think
it
going
to
be
in
her
heart
she
could
hear
the
pretty
soft
little
loving
voice
of
the
baby
lamb
so
different
from
the
affected
tones
of
the
dreadful
lamb
one
of
whose
names
was
devereux
saying
me
love
panty
wants
to
come
to
own
panty
oh
let
go
home
for
goodness
sake
she
said
you
shall
say
whatever
you
like
in
the
morning
if
you
can
she
added
in
a
whisper
it
was
a
gloomy
party
that
went
home
through
the
soft
evening
during
anthea
remarks
robert
had
again
made
play
with
the
pin
and
the
bicycle
tyre
and
the
lamb
whom
they
had
to
call
maur
or
devereux
or
hilary
seemed
really
at
last
to
have
had
his
fill
of
so
the
machine
was
wheeled
the
sun
was
just
on
the
point
of
setting
when
they
arrived
at
the
white
house
the
four
elder
children
would
have
liked
to
linger
in
the
lane
till
the
complete
sunsetting
turned
the
lamb
whose
christian
names
i
will
not
further
weary
you
by
repeating
into
their
own
dear
tiresome
baby
brother
but
he
in
his
insisted
on
going
on
and
thus
he
was
met
in
the
front
garden
by
martha
now
you
remember
that
as
a
special
favour
the
psammead
had
arranged
that
the
servants
in
the
house
should
never
notice
any
change
brought
about
by
the
wishes
of
the
children
therefore
martha
merely
saw
the
usual
party
with
the
baby
lamb
about
whom
she
had
been
desperately
anxious
all
the
afternoon
trotting
beside
anthea
on
fat
baby
legs
while
the
children
of
course
still
saw
the
lamb
never
mind
what
names
he
was
christened
by
and
martha
rushed
at
him
and
caught
him
in
her
arms
exclaiming
come
to
his
own
martha
then
a
precious
poppet
the
lamb
whose
names
shall
now
be
buried
in
oblivion
struggled
furiously
an
expression
of
intense
horror
and
annoyance
was
seen
on
his
face
but
martha
was
stronger
than
he
she
lifted
him
up
and
carried
him
into
the
house
none
of
the
children
will
ever
forget
that
picture
the
neat
young
man
with
the
green
necktie
and
the
little
black
mustache
fortunately
he
was
slightly
built
and
not
tall
struggling
in
the
sturdy
arms
of
martha
who
bore
him
away
helpless
imploring
him
as
she
went
to
be
a
good
boy
now
and
come
and
have
his
nice
bremmink
fortunately
the
sun
set
as
they
reached
the
doorstep
the
bicycle
disappeared
and
martha
was
seen
to
carry
into
the
house
the
real
live
darling
sleepy
lamb
the
lamb
nameless
henceforth
was
gone
for
ever
illustration
the
lamb
struggled
for
ever
said
cyril
because
as
soon
as
ever
the
lamb
old
enough
to
be
bullied
we
must
jolly
well
begin
to
bully
him
for
his
own
sake
so
that
he
may
grow
up
like
you
sha
bully
him
said
anthea
stoutly
not
if
i
can
stop
it
we
must
tame
him
by
kindness
said
jane
you
see
said
robert
if
he
grows
up
in
the
usual
way
there
be
plenty
of
time
to
correct
him
as
he
goes
along
the
awful
thing
was
his
growing
up
so
suddenly
there
was
no
time
to
improve
him
at
all
he
does
want
any
improving
said
anthea
as
the
voice
of
the
lamb
came
cooing
through
the
open
door
just
as
she
had
heard
it
in
her
heart
that
afternoon
me
loves
panty
wants
to
come
to
own
panty
chapter
x
scalps
probably
the
day
would
have
been
a
greater
success
if
cyril
had
not
been
reading
last
of
the
the
story
was
running
in
his
head
at
breakfast
and
as
he
took
his
third
cup
of
tea
he
said
dreamily
i
wish
there
were
red
indians
in
england
not
big
ones
you
know
but
little
ones
just
about
the
right
size
for
us
to
fight
everyone
disagreed
with
him
at
the
time
and
no
one
attached
any
importance
to
the
incident
but
when
they
went
down
to
the
to
ask
for
a
hundred
pounds
in
pieces
with
queen
head
on
to
prevent
mistakes
which
they
had
always
felt
to
be
a
really
reasonable
wish
that
must
turn
out
well
they
found
out
that
they
had
done
it
again
for
the
psammead
which
was
very
cross
and
sleepy
said
oh
do
bother
me
you
had
your
wish
i
did
know
it
said
cyril
do
you
remember
yesterday
said
the
still
more
disagreeably
you
asked
me
to
let
you
have
your
wishes
wherever
you
happened
to
be
and
you
wished
this
morning
and
you
got
it
oh
have
we
said
robert
what
is
it
so
you
forgotten
said
the
psammead
beginning
to
burrow
never
mind
you
know
soon
enough
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
a
nice
thing
you
let
yourselves
in
for
we
always
do
somehow
said
jane
sadly
and
now
the
odd
thing
was
that
no
one
could
remember
anyone
having
wished
for
anything
that
morning
the
wish
about
the
red
indians
had
not
stuck
in
anyone
head
it
was
a
most
anxious
morning
everyone
was
trying
to
remember
what
had
been
wished
for
and
no
one
could
and
everyone
kept
expecting
something
awful
to
happen
every
minute
it
was
most
agitating
they
knew
from
what
the
psammead
had
said
that
they
must
have
wished
for
something
more
than
usually
undesirable
and
they
spent
several
hours
in
most
agonizing
uncertainty
it
was
not
till
nearly
that
jane
tumbled
over
last
of
the
which
had
of
course
been
left
face
downwards
on
the
floor
and
when
anthea
had
picked
her
and
the
book
up
she
suddenly
said
i
know
and
sat
down
flat
on
the
carpet
oh
pussy
how
awful
it
was
indians
he
wished
for
cyril
at
breakfast
do
you
remember
he
said
wish
there
were
red
indians
in
england
and
now
there
are
and
they
going
about
scalping
people
all
over
the
country
as
likely
as
not
perhaps
they
only
in
northumberland
and
durham
said
jane
soothingly
it
was
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
it
could
really
hurt
people
much
to
be
scalped
so
far
away
as
that
do
you
believe
it
said
anthea
the
sammyadd
said
we
let
ourselves
in
for
a
nice
thing
that
means
they
come
and
suppose
they
scalped
the
lamb
perhaps
the
scalping
would
come
right
again
at
sunset
said
jane
but
she
did
not
speak
so
hopefully
as
usual
not
it
said
anthea
the
things
that
grow
out
of
the
wishes
do
go
look
at
the
fifteen
shillings
pussy
i
going
to
break
something
and
you
must
let
me
have
every
penny
of
money
you
got
the
indians
will
come
do
you
see
that
spiteful
psammead
as
good
as
said
so
you
see
what
my
plan
is
come
on
jane
did
not
see
at
all
but
she
followed
her
sister
meekly
into
mother
bedroom
anthea
lifted
down
the
heavy
it
had
a
pattern
of
storks
and
long
grasses
on
it
which
anthea
never
forgot
she
carried
it
into
the
and
carefully
emptied
the
water
out
of
it
into
the
bath
then
she
took
the
jug
back
into
the
bedroom
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
you
know
how
a
jug
always
breaks
if
you
happen
to
drop
it
by
accident
if
you
happen
to
drop
it
on
purpose
it
is
quite
different
anthea
dropped
that
jug
three
times
and
it
was
as
unbroken
as
ever
so
at
last
she
had
to
take
her
father
and
break
the
jug
with
that
in
cold
blood
it
was
heartless
work
next
she
broke
open
the
with
the
poker
jane
told
her
that
it
was
wrong
of
course
but
anthea
shut
her
lips
very
tight
and
then
said
illustration
she
broke
open
the
with
the
poker
do
be
silly
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
there
was
not
very
much
in
the
only
but
the
girls
between
them
had
nearly
four
shillings
this
made
over
eleven
shillings
as
you
will
easily
see
anthea
tied
up
the
money
in
a
corner
of
her
come
on
jane
she
said
and
ran
down
to
the
farm
she
knew
that
the
farmer
was
going
into
rochester
that
afternoon
in
fact
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
was
to
take
the
four
children
with
him
they
had
planned
this
in
the
happy
hour
when
they
believed
that
they
we
going
to
get
that
hundred
pounds
in
pieces
out
of
the
psammead
they
had
arranged
to
pay
the
farmer
two
shillings
each
for
the
ride
now
anthea
hastily
explained
to
him
that
they
could
not
go
but
would
he
take
martha
and
the
baby
instead
he
agreed
but
he
was
not
pleased
to
get
only
instead
of
eight
shillings
then
the
girls
ran
home
again
anthea
was
agitated
but
not
flurried
when
she
came
to
think
it
over
afterwards
she
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
had
acted
with
the
most
promptitude
just
like
a
born
general
she
fetched
a
little
box
from
her
corner
drawer
and
went
to
find
martha
who
was
laying
the
cloth
and
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
look
here
said
anthea
i
broken
the
water
jug
in
mother
room
just
like
you
always
up
to
some
mischief
said
martha
dumping
down
a
with
a
bang
do
be
cross
martha
dear
said
anthea
i
got
enough
money
to
pay
for
a
new
one
if
only
you
be
a
dear
and
go
and
buy
it
for
us
your
cousins
keep
a
do
they
and
i
would
like
you
to
get
it
in
case
mother
comes
home
you
know
she
said
she
might
perhaps
but
you
all
going
into
town

said
martha
we
ca
afford
to
if
we
get
the
new
jug
said
anthea
but
we
pay
for
you
to
go
if
you
take
the
lamb
and
i
say
martha
look
here
i
give
you
my
liberty
box
if
you
go
look
it
most
awfully
pretty
all
inlaid
with
real
silver
and
ivory
and
ebony
like
king
solomon
temple
i
see
said
martha
no
i
do
want
your
box
miss
what
you
want
is
to
get
the
precious
lamb
off
your
hands
for
the
afternoon
do
you
go
for
to
think
i
do
see
through
you
this
was
so
true
that
anthea
longed
to
deny
it
at
once
martha
had
no
business
to
know
so
much
but
she
held
her
tongue
martha
set
down
the
bread
with
a
bang
that
made
it
jump
off
its
trencher
i
want
the
jug
got
said
anthea
softly
you
go
you
well
just
for
this
once
i
do
mind
but
mind
you
do
get
into
none
of
your
outrageous
mischief
while
i
gone
that
all
he
going
earlier
than
he
thought
said
anthea
eagerly
you
better
hurry
and
get
dressed
do
put
on
that
lovely
purple
frock
martha
and
the
hat
with
the
pink
cornflowers
and
the
collar
finish
laying
the
cloth
and
i
wash
the
lamb
and
get
him
ready
as
she
washed
the
unwilling
lamb
and
hurried
him
into
his
best
clothes
anthea
peeped
out
of
the
window
from
time
to
time
so
far
all
was
well
she
could
see
no
red
indians
when
with
a
rush
and
a
scurry
and
some
deepening
of
the
damask
of
martha
complexion
she
and
the
lamb
had
been
got
off
anthea
drew
a
deep
breath
safe
she
said
and
to
jane
horror
flung
herself
down
on
the
floor
and
burst
into
floods
of
tears
jane
did
not
understand
at
all
how
a
person
could
be
so
brave
and
like
a
general
and
then
suddenly
give
way
and
go
flat
like
an
when
you
prick
it
it
is
better
not
to
go
flat
of
course
but
you
will
observe
that
anthea
did
not
give
way
till
her
aim
was
accomplished
she
had
got
the
dear
lamb
out
of
danger
she
felt
certain
that
the
red
indians
would
be
round
the
white
house
or
nowhere
the
farmer
cart
would
not
come
back
till
after
sunset
so
she
could
afford
to
cry
a
little
it
was
partly
with
joy
that
she
cried
because
she
had
done
what
she
meant
to
do
she
cried
for
about
three
minutes
while
jane
hugged
her
miserably
and
said
at
intervals
do
cry
panther
dear
then
she
jumped
up
rubbed
her
eyes
hard
with
the
corner
of
her
pinafore
so
that
they
kept
red
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
started
to
tell
the
boys
but
just
at
that
moment
cook
rang
the
and
nothing
could
be
said
till
they
had
been
helped
to
minced
beef
then
cook
left
the
room
and
anthea
told
her
tale
but
it
is
a
mistake
to
tell
a
thrilling
tale
when
people
are
eating
minced
beef
and
boiled
potatoes
there
seemed
somehow
to
be
something
about
the
food
that
made
the
idea
of
red
indians
seem
flat
and
unbelievable
the
boys
actually
laughed
and
called
anthea
a
little
silly
why
said
cyril
i
almost
sure
it
was
before
i
said
that
that
jane
said
she
wished
it
would
be
a
fine
day
it
was
said
jane
briefly
why
if
it
was
indians
cyril
went
on
salt
please
and
mustard
i
must
have
something
to
make
this
mush
go
down
if
it
was
indians
they
have
been
infesting
the
place
long
before
this
you
know
they
would
i
believe
it
the
fine
day
then
why
did
the
sammyadd
say
we
let
ourselves
in
for
a
nice
thing
asked
anthea
she
was
feeling
very
cross
she
knew
she
had
acted
with
nobility
and
discretion
and
after
that
it
was
very
hard
to
be
called
a
little
silly
especially
when
she
had
the
weight
of
a
burglared
and
about
mostly
in
coppers
lying
like
lead
upon
her
conscience
there
was
a
silence
during
which
cook
took
away
the
mincy
plates
and
brought
in
the
pudding
as
soon
as
she
had
retired
cyril
began
again
of
course
i
do
mean
to
say
he
admitted
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
get
martha
and
the
lamb
out
of
the
way
for
the
afternoon
but
as
for
red
indians
why
you
know
jolly
well
the
wishes
always
come
that
very
minute
if
there
was
going
to
be
red
indians
they
be
here
now
i
expect
they
are
said
anthea
they
lurking
amid
the
undergrowth
for
anything
you
know
i
do
think
you
most
unkind
indians
almost
always
lurk
really
though
do
they
put
in
jane
anxious
for
peace
no
they
do
said
cyril
tartly
and
i
not
unkind
i
only
truthful
and
i
say
it
was
utter
rot
breaking
the
and
as
for
the
i
believe
it
a
and
i
wonder
if
you
could
be
hanged
for
it
if
any
of
us
was
to
split
shut
up
ca
you
said
robert
but
cyril
could
you
see
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
if
there
be
indians
they
would
be
entirely
his
own
fault
so
he
did
not
wish
to
believe
in
them
and
trying
not
to
believe
things
when
in
your
heart
you
are
almost
sure
they
are
true
is
as
bad
for
the
temper
as
anything
i
know
it
simply
idiotic
he
said
talking
about
indians
when
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
jane
who
got
her
wish
look
what
a
fine
day
it
is
he
had
turned
towards
the
window
to
point
out
the
fineness
of
the
day
the
others
turned
too
and
a
frozen
silence
caught
at
cyril
and
none
of
the
others
felt
at
all
like
breaking
it
for
there
peering
round
the
corner
of
the
window
among
the
red
leaves
of
the
virginia
creeper
was
a
face
a
brown
face
with
a
long
nose
and
a
tight
mouth
and
very
bright
eyes
and
the
face
was
painted
in
coloured
patches
it
had
long
black
hair
and
in
the
hair
were
feathers
every
child
mouth
in
the
room
opened
and
stayed
open
the
pudding
was
growing
white
and
cold
on
their
plates
no
one
could
move
suddenly
the
feathered
head
was
cautiously
withdrawn
and
the
spell
was
broken
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
anthea
first
words
were
very
like
a
girl
there
now
she
said
i
told
you
so
the
pudding
had
now
definitely
ceased
to
charm
hastily
wrapping
their
portions
in
a
of
the
week
before
the
week
before
last
they
hid
them
behind
the
crinkled
paper
and
fled
upstairs
to
reconnoitre
and
to
hold
a
hurried
council
pax
said
cyril
handsomely
when
they
reached
their
mother
bedroom
panther
i
sorry
if
i
was
a
brute
all
right
said
anthea
but
you
see
now
no
further
trace
of
indians
however
could
be
discerned
from
the
windows
well
said
robert
what
are
we
to
do
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
said
anthea
who
was
now
generally
admitted
to
be
the
heroine
of
the
day
is
if
we
dressed
up
as
like
indians
as
we
can
and
looked
out
of
the
windows
or
even
went
out
they
might
think
we
were
the
powerful
leaders
of
a
large
neighbouring
tribe
and
and
not
do
anything
to
us
you
know
for
fear
of
awful
vengeance
but
eliza
and
the
cook
said
jane
you
forget
they
ca
notice
anything
said
robert
they
notice
anything
out
of
the
way
even
if
they
were
scalped
or
roasted
at
a
slow
fire
but
would
they
come
right
at
sunset
of
course
you
ca
be
really
scalped
or
burned
to
death
without
noticing
it
and
you
be
sure
to
notice
it
next
day
even
if
it
escaped
your
attention
at
the
time
said
cyril
i
think
anthea
right
but
we
shall
want
a
most
awful
lot
of
feathers
i
go
down
to
the
said
robert
there
one
of
the
turkeys
in
there
it
not
very
well
i
could
cut
its
feathers
without
it
minding
much
it
very
bad
does
seem
to
care
what
happens
to
it
get
me
the
scissors
earnest
reconnoitring
convinced
them
all
that
no
indians
were
in
the
robert
went
in
five
minutes
he
came
back
pale
but
with
many
feathers
look
here
he
said
this
is
jolly
serious
i
cut
off
the
feathers
and
when
i
turned
to
come
out
there
was
an
indian
squinting
at
me
from
under
the
old
i
just
brandished
the
feathers
and
yelled
and
got
away
before
he
could
get
the
coop
off
top
of
himself
panther
get
the
coloured
blankets
off
our
beds
and
look
slippy
ca
you
it
is
wonderful
how
like
an
indian
you
can
make
yourself
with
blankets
and
feathers
and
coloured
scarves
of
course
none
of
the
children
happened
to
have
long
black
hair
but
there
was
a
lot
of
black
calico
that
had
been
bought
to
cover
with
they
cut
strips
of
this
into
a
sort
of
fine
fringe
and
fastened
it
round
their
heads
with
the
ribbons
off
the
girls
sunday
dresses
then
they
stuck
turkeys
feathers
in
the
ribbons
the
calico
looked
very
like
long
black
hair
especially
when
the
strips
began
to
curl
up
a
bit
but
our
faces
said
anthea
they
not
at
all
the
right
colour
we
all
rather
pale
and
i
sure
i
do
know
why
but
cyril
is
the
colour
of
putty
i
not
said
cyril
the
real
indians
outside
seem
to
be
brownish
said
robert
hastily
i
think
we
ought
to
be
really
it
sort
of
superior
to
have
a
red
skin
if
you
are
one
the
red
ochre
cook
uses
for
the
kitchen
bricks
seemed
to
be
about
the
reddest
thing
in
the
house
the
children
mixed
some
in
a
saucer
with
milk
as
they
had
seen
cook
do
for
the
kitchen
floor
then
they
carefully
painted
each
other
faces
and
hands
with
it
till
they
were
quite
as
red
as
any
red
indian
need
be
if
not
redder
they
knew
at
once
that
they
must
look
very
terrible
when
they
met
eliza
in
the
passage
and
she
screamed
aloud
this
unsolicited
testimonial
pleased
them
very
much
hastily
telling
her
not
to
be
a
goose
and
that
it
was
only
a
game
the
four
blanketed
feathered
really
and
truly
redskins
went
boldly
out
to
meet
the
foe
i
say
boldly
that
is
because
i
wish
to
be
polite
at
any
rate
they
went
along
the
hedge
dividing
the
wilderness
from
the
garden
was
a
row
of
dark
heads
all
highly
feathered
it
our
only
chance
whispered
anthea
much
better
than
to
wait
for
their
attack
we
must
pretend
like
mad
like
that
game
of
cards
where
you
pretend
you
got
aces
when
you
have
fluffing
they
call
it
i
think
now
then
whoop
with
four
wild
or
as
near
them
as
white
children
could
be
expected
to
go
without
any
previous
practice
they
rushed
through
the
gate
and
struck
four
attitudes
in
face
of
the
line
of
red
indians
these
were
all
about
the
same
height
and
that
height
was
cyril
i
hope
to
goodness
they
can
talk
english
said
cyril
through
his
attitude
anthea
knew
they
could
though
she
never
knew
how
she
came
to
know
it
she
had
a
white
towel
tied
to
a
this
was
a
flag
of
truce
and
she
waved
it
in
the
hope
that
the
indians
would
know
what
it
was
apparently
they
did
for
one
who
was
browner
than
the
others
stepped
forward
ye
seek
a
he
said
in
excellent
english
i
am
golden
eagle
of
the
mighty
tribe
of
illustration
ye
seek
a
he
said
and
i
said
anthea
with
a
sudden
inspiration
am
the
black
panther
chief
of
the
the
the
mazawattee
tribe
my
brothers
i
mean
yes
i
do
the
tribe
i
mean
the
mazawattees
are
in
ambush
below
the
brow
of
yonder
hill
and
what
mighty
warriors
be
these
asked
golden
eagle
turning
to
the
others
cyril
said
he
was
the
great
chief
squirrel
of
the
moning
congo
tribe
and
seeing
that
jane
was
sucking
her
thumb
and
could
evidently
think
of
no
name
for
herself
he
added
this
great
warrior
is
wild
cat
pussy
ferox
we
call
it
in
this
land
leader
of
the
vast
phiteezi
tribe
and
thou
valorous
redskin
golden
eagle
inquired
suddenly
of
robert
who
taken
unawares
could
only
reply
that
he
was
bobs
leader
of
the
cape
mounted
police
and
now
said
black
panther
our
tribes
if
we
just
whistle
them
up
will
far
outnumber
your
puny
forces
so
resistance
is
useless
return
therefore
to
your
land
o
brother
and
smoke
pipes
of
peace
in
your
wampums
with
your
squaws
and
your
and
dress
yourselves
in
the
gayest
wigwams
and
eat
happily
of
the
juicy
moccasins
you
got
it
all
wrong
murmured
cyril
angrily
but
golden
eagle
only
looked
inquiringly
at
her
thy
customs
are
other
than
ours
o
black
panther
he
said
bring
up
thy
tribe
that
we
may
hold
in
state
before
them
as
becomes
great
chiefs
we
bring
them
up
right
enough
said
anthea
with
their
bows
and
arrows
and
tomahawks
and
and
everything
you
can
think
of
if
you
do
look
sharp
and
go
she
spoke
bravely
enough
but
the
hearts
of
all
the
children
were
beating
furiously
and
their
breath
came
in
shorter
and
shorter
gasps
for
the
little
real
red
indians
were
closing
up
round
them
coming
nearer
and
nearer
with
angry
murmurs
so
that
they
were
the
centre
of
a
crowd
of
dark
cruel
faces
it
no
go
whispered
robert
i
knew
it
would
be
we
must
make
a
bolt
for
the
psammead
it
might
help
us
if
it
does
well
i
suppose
we
shall
come
alive
again
at
sunset
i
wonder
if
scalping
hurts
as
much
as
they
say
i
wave
the
flag
again
said
anthea
if
they
stand
back
we
run
for
it
she
waved
the
towel
and
the
chief
commanded
his
followers
to
stand
back
then
charging
wildly
at
the
place
where
the
line
of
indians
was
thinnest
the
four
children
started
to
run
their
first
rush
knocked
down
some
indians
over
whose
blanketed
bodies
the
children
leaped
and
made
straight
for
the
this
was
no
time
for
the
safe
easy
way
by
which
carts
go
down
right
over
the
edge
of
the
they
went
among
the
yellow
and
pale
purple
flowers
and
dried
grasses
past
the
little
bank
martins
little
front
doors
skipping
clinging
bounding
stumbling
sprawling
and
finally
rolling
yellow
eagle
and
his
followers
came
up
with
them
just
at
the
very
spot
where
they
had
seen
the
psammead
that
morning
breathless
and
beaten
the
wretched
children
now
awaited
their
fate
sharp
knives
and
axes
gleamed
round
them
but
worse
than
these
was
the
cruel
light
in
the
eyes
of
golden
eagle
and
his
followers
ye
have
lied
to
us
o
black
panther
of
the
mazawattees
and
thou
too
squirrel
of
the
moning
congos
these
also
pussy
ferox
of
the
phiteezi
and
bobs
of
the
cape
mounted
police
these
also
have
lied
to
us
if
not
with
their
tongues
yet
by
their
silence
ye
have
lied
under
the
cover
of
the
of
the
ye
have
no
followers
your
tribes
are
far
away
following
the
hunting
trail
what
shall
be
their
doom
he
concluded
turning
with
a
bitter
smile
to
the
other
red
indians
build
we
the
fire
shouted
his
followers
and
at
once
a
dozen
ready
volunteers
started
to
look
for
fuel
the
four
children
each
held
between
two
strong
little
indians
cast
despairing
glances
round
them
oh
if
they
could
only
see
the
psammead
do
you
mean
to
scalp
us
first
and
then
roast
us
asked
anthea
desperately
of
course
redskin
opened
his
eyes
at
her
it
always
done
the
indians
had
formed
a
ring
round
the
children
and
now
sat
on
the
ground
gazing
at
their
captives
there
was
a
threatening
silence
then
slowly
by
twos
and
threes
the
indians
who
had
gone
to
look
for
firewood
came
back
and
they
came
back
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
a
single
stick
of
wood
for
a
fire
no
one
ever
can
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
that
part
of
kent
the
children
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
but
it
ended
in
a
moan
of
terror
for
bright
knives
were
being
brandished
all
about
them
next
moment
each
child
was
seized
by
an
indian
each
closed
its
eyes
and
tried
not
to
scream
they
waited
for
the
sharp
agony
of
the
knife
it
did
not
come
next
moment
they
were
released
and
fell
in
a
trembling
heap
their
heads
did
not
hurt
at
all
they
only
felt
strangely
cool
wild
rang
in
their
ears
when
they
ventured
to
open
their
eyes
they
saw
four
of
their
foes
dancing
round
them
with
wild
leaps
and
screams
and
each
of
the
four
brandished
in
his
hand
a
scalp
of
long
flowing
black
hair
they
put
their
hands
to
their
heads
their
own
scalps
were
safe
the
poor
untutored
savages
had
indeed
scalped
the
children
but
they
had
only
so
to
speak
scalped
them
of
the
black
calico
ringlets
illustration
bright
knives
were
being
brandished
all
about
them
the
children
fell
into
each
other
arms
sobbing
and
laughing
their
scalps
are
ours
chanted
the
chief
were
their
hairs
they
came
off
in
the
hands
of
the
victors
without
struggle
without
resistance
they
yielded
their
scalps
to
the
conquering
oh
how
little
a
thing
is
a
scalp
so
lightly
won
they
take
our
real
ones
in
a
minute
you
see
if
they
do
said
robert
trying
to
rub
some
of
the
red
ochre
off
his
face
and
hands
on
to
his
hair
cheated
of
our
just
and
fiery
revenge
are
we
the
chant
went
on
but
there
are
other
torments
than
the
and
the
flames
yet
is
the
slow
fire
the
correct
thing
o
strange
unnatural
country
wherein
a
man
may
find
no
wood
to
burn
his
enemy
ah
for
the
boundless
forests
of
my
native
land
where
the
great
trees
for
thousands
of
miles
grow
but
to
furnish
firewood
wherewithal
to
burn
our
foes
ah
would
we
were
but
in
our
native
forest
once
more
suddenly
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
golden
gravel
shone
all
round
the
four
children
instead
of
the
dusky
figures
for
every
single
indian
had
vanished
on
the
instant
at
their
leader
word
the
psammead
must
have
been
there
all
the
time
and
it
had
given
the
indian
chief
his
wish
martha
brought
home
a
jug
with
a
pattern
of
storks
and
long
grasses
on
it
also
she
brought
back
all
anthea
money
my
cousin
she
gave
me
the
jug
for
luck
she
said
it
was
an
odd
one
what
the
basin
of
had
got
smashed
oh
martha
you
are
a
dear
sighed
anthea
throwing
her
arms
round
her
yes
giggled
martha
you
better
make
the
most
of
me
while
got
me
i
shall
give
your
ma
notice
directly
minute
she
comes
back
oh
martha
we
have
been
so
horrid
to
you
have
we
asked
anthea
aghast
oh
it
is
that
miss
martha
giggled
more
than
ever
i
to
be
married
it
beale
the
gamekeeper
he
been
to
me
off
and
on
ever
since
you
come
home
from
the
clergyman
where
you
got
locked
up
on
the
and
i
said
the
word
an
made
him
a
happy
man
anthea
put
the
back
in
the
and
pasted
paper
over
the
place
where
the
poker
had
broken
it
she
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
do
this
and
she
does
not
know
to
this
day
whether
breaking
open
a
is
or
is
not
a
hanging
matter
chapter
xi
and
last
the
last
wish
of
course
you
who
see
above
that
this
is
the
eleventh
and
last
chapter
know
very
well
that
the
day
of
which
this
chapter
tells
must
be
the
last
on
which
cyril
anthea
robert
and
jane
will
have
a
chance
of
getting
anything
out
of
the
psammead
or
but
the
children
themselves
did
not
know
this
they
were
full
of
rosy
visions
and
whereas
on
the
other
days
they
had
often
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
think
of
anything
really
nice
to
wish
for
their
brains
were
now
full
of
the
most
beautiful
and
sensible
ideas
this
as
jane
remarked
afterwards
is
always
the
way
everyone
was
up
extra
early
that
morning
and
these
plans
were
hopefully
discussed
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
the
old
idea
of
one
hundred
pounds
in
modern
florins
was
still
first
favourite
but
there
were
others
that
ran
it
close
the
chief
of
these
being
the
idea
this
had
a
great
advantage
you
could
wish
for
a
pony
each
during
the
morning
ride
it
all
day
have
it
vanish
at
sunset
and
wish
it
back
again
next
day
which
would
be
an
economy
of
litter
and
stabling
but
at
breakfast
two
things
happened
first
there
was
a
letter
from
mother
granny
was
better
and
mother
and
father
hoped
to
be
home
that
very
afternoon
a
cheer
arose
and
of
course
this
news
at
once
scattered
all
the
for
everyone
saw
quite
plainly
that
the
wish
of
the
day
must
be
something
to
please
mother
and
not
to
please
themselves
i
wonder
what
she
like
pondered
cyril
she
like
us
all
to
be
good
said
jane
primly
yes
but
that
so
dull
for
us
cyril
rejoined
and
besides
i
should
hope
we
could
be
that
without
to
help
us
no
it
must
be
something
splendid
that
we
could
possibly
get
without
wishing
for
look
out
said
anthea
in
a
warning
voice
do
forget
yesterday
remember
we
get
our
wishes
now
just
wherever
we
happen
to
be
when
we
say
wish
do
let
let
ourselves
in
for
anything
silly
of
all
days
all
right
said
cyril
you
need
talk
so
much
just
then
martha
came
in
with
a
jug
full
of
hot
water
for
the
and
a
face
full
of
importance
for
the
children
a
blessing
we
all
alive
to
eat
our
breakfast
she
said
darkly
why
whatever
happened
everybody
asked
oh
nothing
said
martha
only
it
seems
nobody
safe
from
being
murdered
in
their
beds
nowadays
why
said
jane
as
an
agreeable
thrill
of
horror
ran
down
her
back
and
legs
and
out
at
her
toes
anyone
been
murdered
in
their
beds
well
not
exactly
said
martha
but
they
might
just
as
well
been
burglars
over
at
peasemarsh
place
beale
just
told
me
and
they
took
every
single
one
of
lady
chittenden
diamonds
and
jewels
and
things
and
she
out
of
one
fainting
fit
into
another
with
hardly
time
to
say
my
diamonds
in
between
and
lord
away
in
london
lady
chittenden
said
anthea
we
seen
her
she
wears
a
dress
and
she
has
no
children
of
her
own
and
ca
abide
other
folkses
that
her
said
martha
well
she
put
all
her
trust
in
riches
and
you
see
how
she
served
they
say
the
diamonds
and
things
was
worth
thousands
of
pounds
there
was
a
necklace
and
a
river
whatever
that
is
and
no
end
of
bracelets
and
a
tarrer
and
ever
so
many
rings
but
there
i
must
stand
talking
and
all
the
place
to
clean
down
afore
your
ma
comes
home
i
do
see
why
she
should
ever
have
had
such
lots
of
diamonds
said
anthea
when
martha
had
flounced
off
she
was
not
at
all
a
nice
lady
i
thought
and
mother
has
any
diamonds
and
hardly
any
jewels
the
topaz
necklace
and
the
sapphire
ring
daddy
gave
her
when
they
were
engaged
and
the
garnet
star
and
the
little
pearl
brooch
with
hair
in
it
that
about
all
when
i
grown
up
i
buy
mother
no
end
of
diamonds
said
robert
if
she
wants
them
i
shall
make
so
much
money
exploring
in
africa
i
know
what
to
do
with
it
would
it
be
jolly
said
jane
dreamily
if
mother
could
find
all
these
lovely
things
necklaces
and
rivers
of
diamonds
and
tarrers
said
cyril
ti
aras
then
and
rings
and
everything
in
her
room
when
she
came
home
i
wish
she
would
the
others
gazed
at
her
in
horror
well
she
said
robert
you
wished
my
good
jane
and
our
only
chance
now
is
to
find
the
psammead
and
if
it
in
a
good
temper
it
take
back
the
wish
and
give
us
another
if
not
well
goodness
knows
what
we
in
for
the
police
of
course
and
do
cry
silly
we
stand
by
you
father
says
we
need
never
to
be
afraid
if
we
do
do
anything
wrong
and
always
speak
the
truth
but
cyril
and
anthea
exchanged
gloomy
glances
they
remembered
how
convincing
the
truth
about
the
psammead
had
been
once
before
when
told
to
the
police
it
was
a
day
of
misfortunes
of
course
the
psammead
could
not
be
found
nor
the
jewels
though
every
one
of
the
children
searched
the
room
again
and
again
of
course
robert
said
could
find
them
it
be
mother
who
do
that
perhaps
she
think
they
been
in
the
house
for
years
and
years
and
never
know
they
are
the
stolen
ones
at
all
oh
yes
cyril
was
very
scornful
then
mother
will
be
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
and
you
know
jolly
well
what
worse
than
another
and
exhaustive
search
of
the
failed
to
reveal
the
psammead
so
the
children
went
back
to
the
house
slowly
and
sadly
i
do
care
said
anthea
stoutly
we
tell
mother
the
truth
and
she
give
back
the
jewels
and
make
everything
all
right
do
you
think
so
said
cyril
slowly
do
you
think
she
believe
us
could
anyone
believe
about
a
sammyadd
unless
they
seen
it
think
we
pretending
or
else
she
think
we
raving
mad
and
then
we
shall
be
sent
to
the
how
would
you
like
it
he
turned
suddenly
on
the
miserable
jane
how
would
you
like
it
to
be
shut
up
in
an
iron
cage
with
bars
and
padded
walls
and
nothing
to
do
but
stick
straws
in
your
hair
all
day
and
listen
to
the
howlings
and
ravings
of
the
other
maniacs
make
up
your
minds
to
it
all
of
you
it
no
use
telling
mother
but
it
true
said
jane
of
course
it
is
but
it
not
true
enough
for
people
to
believe
it
said
anthea
cyril
right
let
put
flowers
in
all
the
vases
and
try
not
to
think
about
the
diamonds
after
all
everything
has
come
right
in
the
end
all
the
other
times
so
they
filled
all
the
pots
they
could
find
with
flowers
asters
and
zinnias
and
late
red
roses
from
the
wall
of
the
stableyard
till
the
house
was
a
perfect
bower
and
almost
as
soon
as
dinner
was
cleared
away
mother
arrived
and
was
clasped
in
eight
loving
arms
it
was
very
difficult
indeed
not
to
tell
her
all
about
the
psammead
at
once
because
they
had
got
into
the
habit
of
telling
her
everything
but
they
did
succeed
in
not
telling
her
illustration
she
was
clasped
in
eight
loving
arms
mother
on
her
side
had
plenty
to
tell
them
about
granny
and
pigeons
and
auntie
emma
lame
tame
donkey
she
was
very
delighted
with
the
of
the
house
and
everything
seemed
so
natural
and
pleasant
now
that
she
was
home
again
that
the
children
almost
thought
they
must
have
dreamed
the
psammead
but
when
mother
moved
towards
the
stairs
to
go
up
to
her
bedroom
and
take
off
her
bonnet
the
eight
arms
clung
round
her
just
as
if
she
only
had
two
children
one
the
lamb
and
the
other
an
octopus
do
go
up
mummy
darling
said
anthea
let
me
take
your
things
up
for
you
or
i
will
said
cyril
we
want
you
to
come
and
look
at
the
said
robert
oh
do
go
up
said
jane
helplessly
nonsense
dears
said
mother
briskly
i
not
such
an
old
woman
yet
that
i
ca
take
my
bonnet
off
in
the
proper
place
besides
i
must
wash
these
black
hands
of
mine
so
up
she
went
and
the
children
following
her
exchanged
glances
of
gloomy
foreboding
mother
took
off
her
bonnet
it
was
a
very
pretty
hat
really
with
white
roses
in
it
and
when
she
had
taken
it
off
she
went
to
the
to
do
her
pretty
hair
on
the
table
between
the
and
the
lay
a
green
leather
case
mother
opened
it
oh
how
lovely
she
cried
it
was
a
ring
a
large
pearl
with
shining
diamonds
set
round
it
wherever
did
this
come
from
mother
asked
trying
it
on
her
wedding
finger
which
it
fitted
beautifully
however
did
it
come
here
i
do
know
said
each
of
the
children
truthfully
father
must
have
told
martha
to
put
it
here
mother
said
i
run
down
and
ask
her
let
me
look
at
it
said
anthea
who
knew
martha
would
not
be
able
to
see
the
ring
but
when
martha
was
asked
of
course
she
denied
putting
the
ring
there
and
so
did
eliza
and
cook
mother
came
back
to
her
bedroom
very
much
interested
and
pleased
about
the
ring
but
when
she
opened
the
drawer
and
found
a
long
case
containing
an
almost
priceless
diamond
necklace
she
was
more
interested
still
though
not
so
pleased
in
the
wardrobe
when
she
went
to
put
away
her
bonnet
she
found
a
tiara
and
several
brooches
and
the
rest
of
the
jewellery
turned
up
in
various
parts
of
the
room
during
the
next
the
children
looked
more
and
more
uncomfortable
and
now
jane
began
to
sniff
mother
looked
at
her
gravely
jane
she
said
i
am
sure
you
know
something
about
this
now
think
before
you
speak
and
tell
me
the
truth
we
found
a
fairy
said
jane
obediently
illustration
we
found
a
fairy
said
jane
obediently
no
nonsense
please
said
her
mother
sharply
do
be
silly
jane
cyril
interrupted
then
he
went
on
desperately
look
here
mother
we
never
seen
the
things
before
but
lady
chittenden
at
peasmarsh
place
lost
all
her
jewellery
by
wicked
burglars
last
night
could
this
possibly
be
it
all
drew
a
deep
breath
they
were
saved
but
how
could
they
have
put
it
here
and
why
should
they
asked
mother
not
unreasonably
surely
it
would
have
been
easier
and
safer
to
make
off
with
it
suppose
said
cyril
they
thought
it
better
to
wait
for
for
sunset
nightfall
i
mean
before
they
went
off
with
it
no
one
but
us
knew
that
you
were
coming
back
i
must
send
for
the
police
at
once
said
mother
distractedly
oh
how
i
wish
daddy
were
here
would
it
be
better
to
wait
till
he
come
asked
robert
knowing
that
his
father
would
not
be
home
before
sunset
no
no
i
ca
wait
a
minute
with
all
this
on
my
mind
cried
mother
all
this
was
the
heap
of
on
the
bed
they
put
them
all
in
the
wardrobe
and
mother
locked
it
then
mother
called
martha
martha
she
said
has
any
stranger
been
into
my
room
since
i
been
away
now
answer
me
truthfully
no
mum
answered
martha
leastways
what
i
mean
to
say
she
stopped
come
said
her
mistress
kindly
i
see
someone
has
you
must
tell
me
at
once
do
be
frightened
i
sure
have
done
anything
wrong
martha
burst
into
heavy
sobs
i
was
to
give
you
warning
this
very
day
mum
to
leave
at
the
end
of
my
month
so
i
was
on
account
of
me
being
going
to
make
a
respectable
young
man
happy
a
gamekeeper
he
is
by
trade
mum
and
i
would
deceive
you
of
the
name
of
beale
and
it
as
true
as
i
stand
here
it
was
your
coming
home
in
such
a
hurry
and
no
warning
given
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
heart
it
was
as
he
says
my
beauty
he
says
which
i
ai
and
never
was
but
you
know
how
them
men
will
go
on
ca
see
you
and
and
not
lend
a
which
mine
is
a
strong
arm
and
it
yours
martha
my
dear
says
he
and
so
he
helped
me
of
the
windows
but
outside
mum
the
whole
time
and
me
in
if
i
never
say
another
breathing
word
it
gospel
truth
were
you
with
him
the
whole
time
asked
her
mistress
him
outside
and
me
in
i
was
said
martha
except
for
fetching
up
a
fresh
pail
and
the
leather
that
that
slut
of
a
eliza
hidden
away
behind
the
mangle
that
will
do
said
the
children
mother
i
am
not
pleased
with
you
martha
but
you
have
spoken
the
truth
and
that
counts
for
something
when
martha
had
gone
the
children
clung
round
their
mother
oh
mummy
darling
cried
anthea
it
is
beale
fault
it
really
he
a
great
dear
he
is
truly
and
honourably
and
as
honest
as
the
day
do
let
the
police
take
him
mummy
oh
do
do
do
it
was
truly
awful
here
was
an
innocent
man
accused
of
robbery
through
that
silly
wish
of
jane
and
it
was
absolutely
useless
to
tell
the
truth
all
longed
to
but
they
thought
of
the
straws
in
the
hair
and
the
shrieks
of
the
other
frantic
maniacs
and
they
could
not
do
it
is
there
a
cart
hereabouts
asked
the
mother
feverishly
a
trap
of
any
sort
i
must
drive
in
to
rochester
and
tell
the
police
at
once
all
the
children
sobbed
there
a
cart
at
the
farm
but
oh
go
do
go
oh
do
go
wait
till
daddy
comes
home
mother
took
not
the
faintest
notice
when
she
had
set
her
mind
on
a
thing
she
always
went
straight
through
with
it
she
was
rather
like
anthea
in
this
respect
look
here
cyril
she
said
sticking
on
her
hat
with
long
sharp
pins
i
leave
you
in
charge
stay
in
the
you
can
pretend
to
be
swimming
boats
in
the
bath
or
something
say
i
gave
you
leave
but
stay
there
with
the
door
on
the
landing
open
locked
the
other
and
do
let
anyone
go
into
my
room
remember
no
one
knows
the
jewels
are
there
except
me
and
all
of
you
and
the
wicked
thieves
who
put
them
there
robert
you
stay
in
the
garden
and
watch
the
windows
if
anyone
tries
to
get
in
you
must
run
and
tell
the
two
farm
men
that
i
send
up
to
wait
in
the
kitchen
i
tell
them
there
are
dangerous
characters
about
that
true
enough
now
remember
i
trust
you
both
but
i
do
think
they
try
it
till
after
dark
so
quite
safe
darlings
and
she
locked
her
bedroom
door
and
went
off
with
the
key
in
her
pocket
the
children
could
not
help
admiring
the
dashing
and
decided
way
in
which
she
had
acted
they
thought
how
useful
she
would
have
been
in
organising
escape
from
some
of
the
tight
places
in
which
they
had
found
themselves
of
late
in
consequence
of
their
wishes
she
a
born
general
said
cyril
but
do
know
what
going
to
happen
to
us
even
if
the
girls
were
to
hunt
for
that
old
sammyadd
and
find
it
and
get
it
to
take
the
jewels
away
again
mother
would
only
think
we
had
looked
out
properly
and
let
the
burglars
sneak
in
and
get
them
or
else
the
police
will
think
got
them
or
else
that
she
been
fooling
them
oh
it
a
pretty
decent
average
ghastly
mess
this
time
and
no
mistake
he
savagely
made
a
paper
boat
and
began
to
float
it
in
the
bath
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
robert
went
into
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
worn
yellow
grass
with
his
miserable
head
between
his
helpless
hands
anthea
and
jane
whispered
together
in
the
passage
downstairs
where
the
cocoanut
matting
was
with
the
hole
in
it
that
you
always
caught
your
foot
in
if
you
were
not
careful
martha
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
kitchen
grumbling
loud
and
long
it
simply
quite
too
dreadfully
awful
said
anthea
how
do
you
know
all
the
diamonds
are
there
too
if
they
are
the
police
will
think
mother
and
father
have
got
them
and
that
they
only
given
up
some
of
them
for
a
kind
of
desperate
blind
and
they
be
put
in
prison
and
we
shall
be
branded
outcasts
the
children
of
felons
and
it
wo
be
at
all
nice
for
father
and
mother
either
she
added
by
a
candid
but
what
can
we
asked
jane
nothing
at
least
we
might
look
for
the
psammead
again
it
a
very
hot
day
he
may
have
come
out
to
warm
that
whisker
of
his
he
wo
give
us
any
more
beastly
wishes
said
jane
flatly
he
gets
crosser
and
crosser
every
time
we
see
him
i
believe
he
hates
having
to
give
wishes
anthea
had
been
shaking
her
head
gloomily
now
she
stopped
shaking
it
so
suddenly
that
it
really
looked
as
though
she
were
pricking
up
her
ears
what
is
it
asked
jane
oh
have
you
thought
of
something
our
one
chance
cried
anthea
dramatically
the
last
forlorn
hope
come
on
at
a
brisk
trot
she
led
the
way
to
the
oh
joy
there
was
the
psammead
basking
in
a
golden
sandy
hollow
and
preening
its
whiskers
happily
in
the
glowing
afternoon
sun
the
moment
it
saw
them
it
whisked
round
and
began
to
burrow
it
evidently
preferred
its
own
company
to
theirs
but
anthea
was
too
quick
for
it
she
caught
it
by
its
furry
shoulders
gently
but
firmly
and
held
it
here
none
of
that
said
the
psammead
leave
go
of
me
will
you
but
anthea
held
him
fast
dear
kind
darling
sammyadd
she
said
breathlessly
oh
yes
it
all
very
well
it
said
you
want
another
wish
i
expect
but
i
ca
keep
on
slaving
from
morning
till
night
giving
people
their
wishes
i
must
have
time
to
myself
do
you
hate
giving
wishes
asked
anthea
gently
and
her
voice
trembled
with
excitement
of
course
i
do
it
said
leave
go
of
me
or
i
bite
i
really
will
i
mean
it
oh
well
if
you
choose
to
risk
it
anthea
risked
it
and
held
on
look
here
she
said
do
bite
me
listen
to
reason
if
you
only
do
what
we
want
we
never
ask
you
for
another
wish
as
long
as
we
live
the
psammead
was
much
moved
i
do
anything
it
said
in
a
tearful
voice
i
almost
burst
myself
to
give
you
one
wish
after
another
as
long
as
i
held
out
if
you
only
never
never
ask
me
to
do
it
after
if
you
knew
how
i
hate
to
blow
myself
out
with
other
people
wishes
and
how
frightened
i
am
always
that
i
shall
strain
a
muscle
or
something
and
then
to
wake
up
every
morning
and
know
you
to
do
it
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
do
its
voice
cracked
with
emotion
and
the
last
do
was
a
squeak
anthea
set
it
down
gently
on
the
sand
it
all
over
now
she
said
soothingly
we
promise
faithfully
never
to
ask
for
another
wish
after
well
go
ahead
said
the
psammead
let
get
it
over
how
many
can
you
do
i
do
know
as
long
as
i
can
hold
out
well
first
i
wish
lady
chittenden
may
find
she
never
lost
her
jewels
the
psammead
blew
itself
out
collapsed
and
said
done
i
wish
said
anthea
more
slowly
mother
may
get
to
the
police
done
said
the
creature
after
the
proper
interval
i
wish
said
jane
suddenly
mother
could
forget
all
about
the
diamonds
done
said
the
psammead
but
its
voice
was
weaker
would
you
like
to
rest
a
little
asked
anthea
considerately
yes
please
said
the
psammead
and
before
we
go
any
further
will
you
wish
something
for
me
ca
you
do
wishes
for
yourself
of
course
not
it
said
we
were
always
expected
to
give
each
other
our
wishes
not
that
we
had
any
to
speak
of
in
the
good
old
megatherium
days
just
wish
will
you
that
you
may
never
be
able
any
of
you
to
tell
anyone
a
word
about
why
asked
jane
why
do
you
see
if
you
told
i
should
have
no
peace
of
my
life
they
get
hold
of
me
and
they
would
wish
silly
things
like
you
do
but
real
earnest
things
and
the
scientific
people
would
hit
on
some
way
of
making
things
last
after
sunset
as
likely
as
not
and
they
ask
for
a
graduated
and
pensions
and
manhood
suffrage
and
free
secondary
education
and
dull
things
like
that
and
get
them
and
keep
them
and
the
whole
world
would
be
turned
do
wish
it
quick
anthea
repeated
the
psammead
wish
and
it
blew
itself
out
to
a
larger
size
than
they
had
yet
seen
it
attain
and
now
it
said
as
it
collapsed
can
i
do
anything
more
for
you
just
one
thing
and
i
think
that
clears
everything
up
does
it
jane
i
wish
martha
to
forget
about
the
diamond
ring
and
mother
to
forget
about
the
keeper
cleaning
the
windows
it
like
the
bottle
said
jane
yes
i
glad
we
read
that
or
i
should
never
have
thought
of
it
now
said
the
psammead
faintly
i
almost
worn
out
is
there
anything
else
no
only
thank
you
kindly
for
all
you
done
for
us
and
i
hope
have
a
good
long
sleep
and
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
again
some
day
is
that
a
wish
it
said
in
a
weak
voice
yes
please
said
the
two
girls
together
illustration
it
burrowed
and
disappeared
scratching
fiercely
to
the
last
then
for
the
last
time
in
this
story
they
saw
the
psammead
blow
itself
out
and
collapse
suddenly
it
nodded
to
them
blinked
its
long
eyes
burrowed
and
disappeared
scratching
fiercely
to
the
last
and
the
sand
closed
over
it
i
hope
we
done
right
said
jane
i
sure
we
have
said
anthea
come
on
home
and
tell
the
boys
anthea
found
cyril
glooming
over
his
paper
boats
and
told
him
jane
told
robert
the
two
tales
were
only
just
ended
when
mother
walked
in
hot
and
dusty
she
explained
that
as
she
was
being
driven
into
rochester
to
buy
the
girls
autumn
the
axle
had
broken
and
but
for
the
narrowness
of
the
lane
and
the
high
soft
hedges
she
would
have
been
thrown
out
as
it
was
she
was
not
hurt
but
she
had
had
to
walk
home
and
oh
my
dearest
dear
chicks
she
said
i
am
simply
dying
for
a
cup
of
tea
do
run
and
see
if
the
water
boils
so
you
see
it
all
right
jane
whispered
she
does
remember
no
more
does
martha
said
anthea
who
had
been
to
ask
after
the
state
of
the
kettle
as
the
servants
sat
at
their
tea
beale
the
gamekeeper
dropped
in
he
brought
the
welcome
news
that
lady
chittenden
diamonds
had
not
been
lost
at
all
lord
chittenden
had
taken
them
to
be
and
cleaned
and
the
maid
who
knew
about
it
had
gone
for
a
holiday
so
that
was
all
right
i
wonder
if
we
ever
shall
see
the
psammead
again
said
jane
wistfully
as
they
walked
in
the
garden
while
mother
was
putting
the
lamb
to
bed
i
sure
we
shall
said
cyril
if
you
really
wished
it
we
promised
never
to
ask
it
for
another
wish
said
anthea
i
never
want
to
said
robert
earnestly
they
did
see
it
again
of
course
but
not
in
this
story
and
it
was
not
in
a
either
but
in
a
very
very
very
different
place
it
was
in
a
but
i
must
say
no
more
transcriber

varied
hyphenation
retained
