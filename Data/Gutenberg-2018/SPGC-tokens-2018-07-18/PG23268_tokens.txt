the
scalp
hunters
a
romance
of
northern
mexico
by
captain
mayne
reid
this
is
very
much
in
the
cowboys
and
indians
genre
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
author
knew
exactly
what
he
was
writing
about
and
had
lived
through
similar
experiences
it
was
quite
a
hard
book
to
transcribe
though
the
copy
used
was
nice
and
clean
because
of
the
very
large
number
of
words
and
phrases
there
was
also
a
great
deal
of
speech
by
people
whose
grammar
and
words
were
supposed
to
indicate
a
lower
education
hence
it
was
not
at
all
easy
to
present
the
book
as
the
author
would
have
liked
but
we
think
that
at
last
we
have
got
it
just
about
right
on
writing
this
book
reid
had
the
general
public
in
mind
it
was
one
of
his
first
it
was
not
until
later
that
he
adopted
a
more
peaceful
style
and
wrote
for
a
boy
readership
saying
that
in
those
books
there
was
not
a
single
passage
that
a
boy
could
not
read
aloud
to
his
mother
or
his
sister
this
book
falls
just
outside
that
scope
the
scalp
hunters
a
romance
of
northern

by

chapter
one
the
wild
west
unroll
the
world
map
and
look
upon
the
great
northern
continent
of
america
away
to
the
wild
west
away
toward
the
setting
sun
away
beyond
many
a
far
meridian
let
your
eyes
wander
rest
them
where
golden
rivers
rise
among
peaks
that
carry
the
eternal
snow
rest
them
there
you
are
looking
upon
a
land
whose
features
are
by
human
hands
still
bearing
the
marks
of
the
almighty
mould
as
upon
the
morning
of
creation
a
region
whose
every
object
wears
the
impress
of
god
image
his
ambient
spirit
lives
in
the
silent
grandeur
of
its
mountains
and
speaks
in
the
roar
of
its
mighty
rivers
a
region
redolent
of
romance
rich
in
the
reality
of
adventure
follow
me
with
the
eye
of
your
mind
through
scenes
of
wild
beauty
of
savage
sublimity
i
stand
in
an
open
plain
i
turn
my
face
to
the
north
to
the
south
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
and
on
all
sides
behold
the
blue
circle
of
the
heavens
girdling
around
me
nor
rock
nor
tree
breaks
the
ring
of
the
horizon
what
covers
the
broad
expanse
between
wood
water
grass
no
flowers
as
far
as
my
eye
can
range
it
rests
only
on
flowers
on
beautiful
flowers
i
am
looking
as
on
a
tinted
map
an
enamelled
picture
brilliant
with
every
hue
of
the
prism
yonder
is
golden
yellow
where
the
helianthus
turns
her
face
to
the
sun
yonder
scarlet
where
the
malva
erects
its
red
banner
here
is
a
parterre
of
the
purple
monarda
there
the
euphorbia
sheds
its
silver
leaf
yonder
the
orange
predominates
in
the
showy
flowers
of
the
asclepia
and
beyond
the
eye
roams
over
the
pink
blossoms
of
the
cleome
the
breeze
stirs
them
millions
of
corollas
are
waving
their
gaudy
standards
the
tall
stalks
of
the
helianthus
bend
and
rise
in
long
undulations
like
billows
on
a
golden
sea
they
are
at
rest
again
the
air
is
filled
with
odours
sweet
as
the
perfumes
of
araby
or
ind
myriads
of
insects
flap
their
gay
wings
flowers
of
themselves
the
skirr
around
glancing
like
stray
sunbeams
or
poised
on
whirring
wings
drink
from
the
nectared
cups
and
the
wild
bee
with
laden
limbs
clings
among
the
honeyed
pistils
or
leaves
for
his
far
hive
with
a
song
of
joy
who
planted
these
flowers
who
hath
woven
them
into
these
pictured
parterres
nature
it
is
her
richest
mantle
richer
in
its
hues
than
the
scarfs
of
cashmere
this
is
the
weed
prairie
it
is
misnamed
it
is
the
garden
of
god
the
scene
is
changed
i
am
in
a
plain
as
before
with
the
unbroken
horizon
circling
around
me
what
do
i
behold
flowers
no
there
is
not
a
flower
in
sight
but
one
vast
expanse
of
living
verdure
from
north
to
south
from
east
to
west
stretches
the
prairie
meadow
green
as
an
emerald
and
smooth
as
the
surface
of
a
sleeping
lake
the
wind
is
upon
its
bosom
sweeping
the
silken
blades
they
are
in
motion
and
the
verdure
is
dappled
into
lighter
and
darker
shades
as
the
shadows
of
summer
clouds
flitting
across
the
sun
the
eye
wanders
without
resistance
perchance
it
encounters
the
dark
hirsute
forms
of
the
buffalo
or
traces
the
tiny
outlines
of
the
antelope
perchance
it
follows
in
pleased
wonder
the
gallop
of
a
steed
this
is
the
grass
prairie
the
boundless
pasture
of
the
bison
the
scene
changes
the
earth
is
no
longer
level
but
treeless
and
verdant
as
ever
its
surface
exhibits
a
succession
of
parallel
undulations
here
and
there
swelling
into
smooth
round
hills
it
is
covered
with
a
soft
turf
of
brilliant
greenness
these
undulations
remind
one
of
the
ocean
after
a
mighty
storm
when
the
crisped
foam
has
died
upon
the
waves
and
the
big
swell
comes
bowling
in
they
look
as
though
they
had
once
been
such
waves
that
by
an
omnipotent
mandate
had
been
transformed
to
earth
and
suddenly
stood
still
this
is
the
rolling
prairie
again
the
scene
changes
i
am
among
greenswards
and
bright
flowers
but
the
view
is
broken
by
groves
and
clumps
of
the
frondage
is
varied
its
tints
are
vivid
its
outlines
soft
and
graceful
as
i
move
forward
new
landscapes
open
up
continuously
views
and
picturesque
gangs
of
buffalo
herds
of
antelope
and
droves
of
wild
horses
mottle
the
far
vistas
turkeys
run
into
the
coppice
and
pheasants
whirr
up
from
the
path
where
are
the
owners
of
these
lands
of
these
flocks
and
fowls
where
are
the
houses
the
palaces
that
should
appertain
to
these
lordly
parks
i
look
forward
expecting
to
see
the
turrets
of
tall
mansions
spring
up
over
the
groves
but
no
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
no
chimney
sends
forth
its
smoke
although
with
a
cultivated
aspect
this
region
is
only
trodden
by
the
moccasined
foot
of
the
hunter
and
his
enemy
the
red
indian
these
are
the
the
islands
of
the
prairie
sea
i
am
in
the
deep
forest
it
is
night
and
the
log
fire
throws
out
its
vermilion
glare
painting
the
objects
that
surround
our
bivouac
huge
trunks
stand
thickly
around
us
and
massive
limbs
grey
and
stretch
out
and
over
i
notice
the
bark
it
is
cracked
and
clings
in
broad
scales
crisping
outward
long
parasites
creep
from
tree
to
tree
coiling
the
trunks
as
though
they
were
serpents
and
would
crush
them
there
are
no
leaves
overhead
they
have
ripened
and
fallen
but
the
white
spanish
moss
festooned
along
the
branches
hangs
weeping
down
like
the
drapery
of
a
deathbed
prostrate
trunks
yards
in
diameter
and
lie
along
the
ground
their
ends
exhibit
vast
cavities
where
the
porcupine
and
opossum
have
taken
shelter
from
the
cold
my
comrades
wrapped
in
their
blankets
and
stretched
upon
the
dead
leaves
have
gone
to
sleep
they
lie
with
their
feet
to
the
fire
and
their
heads
resting
in
the
hollow
of
their
saddles
the
horses
standing
around
a
tree
and
tied
to
its
lower
branches
seem
also
to
sleep
i
am
awake
and
listening
the
wind
is
high
up
whistling
among
the
twigs
and
causing
the
long
white
streamers
to
oscillate
it
utters
a
wild
and
melancholy
music
there
are
few
other
sounds
for
it
is
winter
and
the
and
cicada
are
silent
i
hear
the
crackling
knots
in
the
fire
the
rustling
of
dry
leaves
swirled
up
by
a
stray
gust
the
of
the
white
owl
the
bark
of
the
raccoon
and
at
intervals
the
dismal
howling
of
wolves
these
are
the
nocturnal
voices
of
the
winter
forest
they
are
savage
sounds
yet
there
is
a
chord
in
my
bosom
that
vibrates
under
their
influence
and
my
spirit
is
tinged
with
romance
as
i
lie
and
listen
the
forest
in
autumn
still
bearing
its
full
frondage
the
leaves
resemble
flowers
so
bright
are
their
hues
they
are
red
and
yellow
and
golden
and
brown
the
woods
are
warm
and
glorious
now
and
the
birds
flutter
among
the
laden
branches
the
eye
wanders
delighted
down
long
vistas
and
over
sunlit
glades
it
is
caught
by
the
flashing
of
gaudy
plumage
the
golden
green
of
the
paroquet
the
blue
of
the
jay
and
the
orange
wing
of
the
oriole
the
flutters
lower
down
in
the
coppice
of
green
pawpaws
or
amidst
the
amber
leaflets
of
the
beechen
thicket
hundreds
of
tiny
wings
flit
through
the
openings
twinkling
in
the
sun
like
the
glancing
of
gems
the
air
is
filled
with
music
sweet
sounds
of
love
the
bark
of
the
squirrel
the
cooing
of
mated
doves
the
of
the
pecker
and
the
constant
and
measured
chirrup
of
the
cicada
are
all
ringing
together
high
up
on
a
topmost
twig
the
pours
forth
his
mimic
note
as
though
he
would
shame
all
other
songsters
into
silence
i
am
in
a
country
of
brown
barren
earth
and
broken
outlines
there
are
rocks
and
clefts
and
patches
of
sterile
soil
strange
vegetable
forms
grow
in
the
clefts
and
hang
over
the
rocks
others
are
spheroidal
in
shape
resting
upon
the
surface
of
the
parched
earth
others
rise
vertically
to
a
great
height
like
carved
and
fluted
columns
some
throw
out
branches
crooked
shaggy
branches
with
hirsute
oval
leaves
yet
there
is
a
homogeneousness
about
all
these
vegetable
forms
in
their
colour
in
their
fruit
and
flowers
that
proclaims
them
of
one
family
they
are
cacti
it
is
a
forest
of
the
mexican
nopal
another
singular
plant
is
here
it
throws
out
long
thorny
leaves
that
curve
downward
it
is
the
agave
the
of
mexico
here
and
there
mingling
with
the
cacti
are
trees
of
acacia
and
mezquite
the
denizens
of
the
no
bright
object
relieves
the
eye
no
bird
pours
its
melody
into
the
ear
the
lonely
owl
flaps
away
into
the
impassable
thicket
the
rattlesnake
glides
under
its
scanty
shade
and
the
coyote
skulks
through
its
silent
glades
i
have
climbed
mountain
after
mountain
and
still
i
behold
peaks
soaring
far
above
crowned
with
the
snow
that
never
melts
i
stand
upon
beetling
cliffs
and
look
into
chasms
that
yawn
beneath
sleeping
in
the
silence
of
desolation
great
fragments
have
fallen
into
them
and
lie
piled
one
upon
another
others
hang
threatening
over
as
if
waiting
for
some
concussion
of
the
atmosphere
to
hurl
them
from
their
balance
dark
precipices
frown
me
into
fear
and
my
head
reels
with
a
dizzy
faintness
i
hold
by
the
shaft
or
the
angle
of
the
firmer
rock
above
and
below
and
around
me
are
mountains
piled
on
mountains
in
chaotic
confusion
some
are
bald
and
bleak
others
exhibit
traces
of
vegetation
in
the
dark
needles
of
the
pine
and
cedar
whose
stunted
forms
from
the
cliffs
here
a
peak
soars
up
till
it
is
lost
in
snow
and
clouds
there
a
ridge
elevates
its
sharp
outline
against
the
sky
while
along
its
side
lie
huge
boulders
of
granite
as
though
they
had
been
hurled
from
the
hands
of
titan
giants
a
fearful
monster
the
grizzly
bear
drags
his
body
along
the
high
ridges
the
carcajou
squats
upon
the
projecting
rock
waiting
the
elk
that
must
pass
to
the
water
below
and
the
bighorn
bounds
from
crag
to
crag
in
search
of
his
shy
mate
along
the
pine
branch
the
bald
buzzard
whets
his
filthy
beak
and
the
soaring
over
all
cuts
sharply
against
the
blue
field
of
the
heavens
these
are
the
rocky
mountains
the
american
andes
the
colossal
vertebras
of
the
continent
such
are
the
aspects
of
the
wild
west
such
is
the
scenery
of
our
drama
let
us
raise
the
curtain
and
bring
on
the
characters
chapter
two
the
prairie
merchants
new
orleans
dear
saint
vrain
our
young
friend
monsieur
henry
haller
goes
to
saint
louis
in
of
the
picturesque
see
that
he
be
put
through
a
course
of
sprouts
yours
luis
walton
charles
saint
vrain
esquire
planters
hotel
saint
louis
with
this
laconic
epistle
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
debarked
at
saint
louis
on
the
of
april
and
drove
to
the
planters
after
getting
my
baggage
stowed
and
my
horse
a
favourite
i
had
brought
with
me
stabled
i
put
on
a
clean
shirt
and
descending
to
the
office
inquired
for
monsieur
saint
vrain
he
was
not
there
he
had
gone
up
the
missouri
river
several
days
before
this
was
a
disappointment
as
i
had
brought
no
other
introduction
to
saint
louis
but
i
endeavoured
to
wait
with
patience
the
return
of
monsieur
saint
vrain
he
was
expected
back
in
less
than
a
week
day
after
day
i
mounted
my
horse
i
rode
up
to
the
mounds
and
out
upon
the
prairies
i
lounged
about
the
hotel
and
smoked
my
cigar
in
its
fine
piazza
i
drank
sherry
cobblers
in
the
saloon
and
read
the
journals
in
the
with
these
and
such
like
occupations
i
killed
time
for
three
whole
days
there
was
a
party
of
gentlemen
stopping
at
the
hotel
who
seemed
to
know
each
other
well
i
might
call
them
a
clique
but
that
is
not
a
good
word
and
does
not
express
what
i
mean
they
appeared
rather
a
band
of
friendly
jovial
fellows
they
strolled
together
through
the
streets
and
sat
side
by
side
at
the
where
they
usually
remained
long
after
the
regular
diners
had
retired
i
noticed
that
they
drank
the
most
expensive
wines
and
smoked
the
finest
cigars
the
house
afforded
my
attention
was
attracted
to
these
men
i
was
struck
with
their
peculiar
bearing
their
erect
carriage
in
the
streets
combined
with
a
boyish
gaiety
so
characteristic
of
the
western
american
they
dressed
nearly
alike
in
fine
black
cloth
white
linen
satin
waistcoats
and
diamond
pins
they
wore
the
whisker
full
but
smoothly
trimmed
and
several
of
them
sported
moustaches
their
hair
fell
curling
over
their
shoulders
and
most
of
them
wore
their
collars
turned
down
displaying
throats
i
was
struck
with
a
resemblance
in
their
physiognomy
their
faces
did
not
resemble
each
other
but
there
was
an
unmistakable
similarity
in
the
expression
of
the
eye
no
doubt
the
mark
that
had
been
made
by
like
occupations
and
experience
were
they
sportsmen
no
the
sportsman
hands
are
whiter
there
is
more
jewellery
on
his
fingers
his
waistcoat
is
of
a
gayer
pattern
and
altogether
his
dress
will
be
more
gaudy
and
moreover
the
sportsman
lacks
that
air
of
confidence
he
dares
not
assume
it
he
may
live
in
the
hotel
but
he
must
be
quiet
and
unobtrusive
the
sportsman
is
a
bird
of
prey
hence
like
all
birds
of
prey
his
habits
are
silent
and
solitary
they
are
not
of
his
profession
who
are
these
gentlemen
i
inquired
from
a
person
who
sat
by
me
indicating
to
him
the
men
of
whom
i
have
spoken
the
prairie
men
the
prairie
men
yes
the
santa
fe
traders
traders
i
echoed
in
some
surprise
not
being
able
to
connect
such
elegants
with
any
ideas
of
trade
or
the
prairies
yes
continued
my
informant
that
large
man
in
the
middle
is
bent
bill
bent
as
he
is
called
the
gentleman
on
his
right
is
young
sublette
the
other
standing
on
his
left
is
one
of
the
choteaus
and
that
is
the
sober
jerry
folger
these
then
are
the
celebrated
prairie
merchants
precisely
so
i
sat
eyeing
them
with
increased
curiosity
i
observed
that
they
were
looking
at
me
and
that
i
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
presently
one
of
them
a
young
fellow
parted
from
the
group
and
walked
up
to
me
were
you
inquiring
for
monsieur
saint
vrain
he
asked
i
was
charles
yes
that
is
the
name
i
am
i
pulled
out
my
note
of
introduction
and
banded
it
to
the
gentleman
who
glanced
over
its
contents
my
dear
friend
said
he
grasping
me
cordially
very
sorry
i
have
not
been
here
i
came
down
the
river
this
morning
how
stupid
of
walton
not
to
superscribe
to
bill
bent
how
long
have
you
been
up
three
days
i
arrived
on
the
you
are
lost
come
let
me
make
you
acquainted
here
bent
bill
jerry
and
the
next
moment
i
had
shaken
hands
with
one
and
all
of
the
traders
of
which
fraternity
i
found
that
my
new
friend
saint
vrain
was
a
member
first
gong
that
asked
one
as
the
loud
scream
of
a
gong
came
through
the
gallery
yes
replied
bent
consulting
his
watch
just
time
to
come
along
bent
moved
towards
the
saloon
and
we
all
followed
the
spring
season
was
setting
in
and
the
young
mint
had
sprouted
a
botanical
fact
with
which
my
new
acquaintances
appeared
to
be
familiar
as
one
and
all
of
them
ordered
a
mint
julep
this
beverage
in
the
mixing
and
drinking
occupied
our
time
until
the
second
scream
of
the
gong
summoned
us
to
dinner
sit
with
us
mr
haller
said
bent
i
am
sorry
we
did
know
you
sooner
you
have
been
lonely
and
so
saying
he
led
the
way
into
the
followed
by
his
companions
and
myself
i
need
not
describe
a
dinner
at
the
planters
with
its
venison
steaks
its
buffalo
tongues
its
prairie
chickens
and
its
delicious
frog
fixings
from
the
illinois
bottom
no
i
would
not
describe
the
dinner
and
what
followed
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
we
sat
until
we
had
the
table
to
ourselves
then
the
cloth
was
removed
and
we
commenced
smoking
regalias
and
drinking
madeira
at
twelve
dollars
a
bottle
this
was
ordered
in
by
someone
not
in
single
bottles
but
by
the
i
remembered
thus
far
well
enough
and
that
whenever
i
took
up
a
or
a
pencil
these
articles
were
snatched
out
of
my
fingers
i
remember
listening
to
stories
of
wild
adventures
among
the
pawnees
and
the
comanches
and
the
blackfeet
until
i
was
filled
with
interest
and
became
enthusiastic
about
prairie
life
then
someone
asked
me
would
i
not
like
to
join
them
in
a
trip
upon
this
i
made
a
speech
and
proposed
to
accompany
my
new
acquaintances
on
their
next
expedition
and
then
saint
vrain
said
i
was
just
the
man
for
their
life
and
this
pleased
me
highly
then
someone
sang
a
spanish
song
with
a
guitar
i
think
and
someone
else
danced
an
indian
and
then
we
all
rose
to
our
feet
and
chorused
the
banner
and
i
remember
nothing
else
after
this
until
next
morning
when
i
remember
well
that
i
awoke
with
a
splitting
headache
i
had
hardly
time
to
reflect
on
my
previous
night
folly
when
the
door
opened
and
saint
vrain
with
half
a
dozen
of
my
table
companions
rushed
into
the
room
they
were
followed
by
a
waiter
who
carried
several
large
glasses
topped
with
ice
and
filled
with
a
pale
liquid
a
sherry
cobbler
mr
haller
cried
one
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
drain
it
my
boy
it
cool
you
in
a
squirrel
jump
i
drank
off
the
refreshing
beverage
as
desired
now
my
dear
friend
said
saint
vrain
you
feel
a
hundred
per
cent
better
but
tell
me
were
you
in
earnest
when
you
spoke
of
going
with
us
across
the
plains
we
start
in
a
week
i
shall
be
sorry
to
part
with
you
so
soon
but
i
was
in
earnest
i
am
going
with
you
if
you
will
only
show
me
how
i
am
to
set
about
it
nothing
easier
buy
yourself
a
horse
i
have
got
one
then
a
few
coarse
articles
of
dress
a
rifle
a
pair
of
pistols
a
stop
stop
i
have
all
these
things
that
is
not
what
i
would
be
at
but
this
you
gentlemen
carry
goods
to
santa
fe
you
double
or
treble
your
money
on
them
now
i
have
ten
thousand
dollars
in
a
bank
here
what
should
hinder
me
to
combine
profit
with
pleasure
and
invest
it
as
you
do
nothing
nothing
a
good
idea
answered
several
well
then
if
any
of
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
go
with
me
and
show
me
what
sort
of
merchandise
i
am
to
lay
in
for
the
santa
fe
market
i
will
pay
his
wine
bill
at
dinner
and
that
no
small
commission
i
think
the
prairie
men
laughed
loudly
declaring
they
would
all
go
with
me
and
after
breakfast
we
started
in
a
body
before
dinner
i
had
invested
nearly
all
my
disposable
funds
in
printed
calicoes
long
knives
and
leaving
just
money
enough
to
purchase
and
hire
teamsters
at
independence
our
point
of
departure
for
the
plains
a
few
days
after
with
my
new
companions
i
was
steaming
up
the
missouri
on
our
way
to
the
trackless
prairies
of
the
far
west
chapter
three
the
prairie
fever
after
a
week
spent
in
independence
buying
mules
and
waggons
we
took
the
route
over
the
plains
there
were
a
hundred
waggons
in
the
caravan
and
nearly
twice
that
number
of
teamsters
and
attendants
two
of
the
capacious
vehicles
contained
all
my
plunder
and
to
manage
them
i
had
hired
a
couple
of
lathy
missourians
i
had
also
engaged
a
canadian
voyageur
named
gode
as
a
sort
of
attendant
or
compagnon
where
are
the
glossy
gentlemen
of
the
planters
hotel
one
would
suppose
they
had
been
left
behind
as
here
are
none
but
men
in
and
slouch
hats
yes
but
under
these
hats
we
recognise
their
faces
and
in
these
rude
shirts
we
have
the
same
jovial
fellows
as
ever
the
silky
black
and
the
diamonds
have
disappeared
for
now
the
traders
flourish
under
the
prairie
costume
i
will
endeavour
to
give
an
idea
of
the
appearance
of
my
companions
by
describing
my
own
for
i
am
tricked
out
very
much
like
themselves
i
wear
a
of
dressed
deerskin
it
is
a
garment
more
after
the
style
of
an
ancient
tunic
than
anything
i
can
think
of
it
is
of
a
light
yellow
colour
beautifully
stitched
and
embroidered
and
the
cape
for
it
has
a
short
cape
is
fringed
by
tags
cut
out
of
the
leather
itself
the
skirt
is
also
bordered
by
a
similar
fringe
and
hangs
full
and
low
a
pair
of
savers
of
scarlet
cloth
cover
my
limbs
to
the
thigh
and
under
these
are
strong
jean
pantaloons
heavy
boots
and
big
brass
spurs
a
coloured
cotton
shirt
a
blue
and
a
guayaquil
hat
complete
the
articles
of
my
everyday
dress
behind
me
on
the
cantle
of
my
saddle
may
be
observed
a
bright
red
object
folded
into
a
cylindrical
form
that
is
my
mackinaw
a
great
favourite
for
it
makes
my
bed
by
night
and
my
greatcoat
on
other
occasions
there
is
a
small
slit
in
the
middle
of
it
through
which
i
thrust
my
head
in
cold
or
rainy
weather
and
i
am
thus
covered
to
the
ankles
as
i
have
said
my
de
are
similarly
attired
there
may
be
a
difference
of
colour
in
the
blanket
or
the
leggings
or
the
shirt
may
be
of
other
materials
but
that
i
have
described
may
be
taken
as
a
character
dress
we
are
all
somewhat
similarly
armed
and
equipped
for
my
part
i
may
say
that
i
am
armed
to
the
teeth
in
my
holsters
i
carry
a
pair
of
colt
revolvers
six
shots
each
in
my
belt
is
another
pair
of
the
small
size
with
five
shots
each
in
addition
i
have
a
light
rifle
making
in
all
shots
which
i
have
learned
to
deliver
in
as
many
seconds
of
time
failing
with
all
these
i
carry
in
my
belt
a
long
shining
blade
known
as
a
bowie
knife
this
last
is
my
hunting
knife
my
dining
knife
and
in
short
my
knife
of
all
work
for
accoutrements
i
have
a
pouch
and
a
flask
both
slung
under
the
right
arm
i
have
also
a
large
gourd
canteen
and
haversack
for
my
rations
so
have
all
my
companions
but
we
are
differently
mounted
some
ride
saddle
mules
others
bestride
mustangs
while
a
few
have
brought
their
favourite
american
horses
i
am
of
this
number
i
ride
a
stallion
with
black
legs
and
muzzle
like
the
withered
fern
he
is
and
of
perfect
proportions
he
is
called
moro
a
spanish
name
given
him
by
the
louisiana
planter
from
whom
i
bought
him
but
why
i
do
not
know
i
have
retained
the
name
and
he
answers
to
it
readily
he
is
strong
fleet
and
beautiful
many
of
my
friends
fancy
him
on
the
route
and
offer
large
prices
for
him
but
these
do
not
tempt
me
for
my
moro
serves
me
well
every
day
i
grow
more
and
more
attached
to
him
my
dog
alp
a
saint
bernard
that
i
bought
from
a
swiss
in
saint
louis
hardly
comes
in
for
a
tithe
of
my
affections
i
find
on
referring
to
my
that
for
weeks
we
travelled
over
the
prairies
without
any
incident
of
unusual
interest
to
me
the
scenery
was
interest
enough
and
i
do
not
remember
a
more
striking
picture
than
to
see
the
long
caravan
of
waggons
the
prairie
ships
deployed
over
the
plain
or
crawling
slowly
up
some
gentle
slope
their
white
tilts
contrasting
beautifully
with
the
deep
green
of
the
earth
at
night
too
the
camp
with
its
corralled
waggons
and
horses
picketed
around
was
equally
a
picture
the
scenery
was
altogether
new
to
me
and
imbued
me
with
impressions
of
a
peculiar
character
the
streams
were
fringed
with
tall
groves
of
cottonwood
trees
whose
stems
supported
a
thick
frondage
of
silvery
leaves
these
groves
meeting
at
different
points
walled
in
the
view
so
dividing
the
prairies
from
one
another
that
we
seemed
to
travel
through
vast
fields
fenced
by
colossal
hedges
we
crossed
many
rivers
fording
some
and
floating
our
waggons
over
others
that
were
deeper
and
wider
occasionally
we
saw
deer
and
antelope
and
our
hunters
shot
a
few
of
these
but
we
had
not
yet
reached
the
range
of
the
buffalo
once
we
stopped
a
day
to
recruit
in
a
wooded
bottom
where
the
grass
was
plentiful
and
the
water
pure
now
and
then
too
we
were
halted
to
mend
a
broken
tongue
or
an
axle
or
help
a
stalled
waggon
from
its
miry
bed
i
had
very
little
trouble
with
my
particular
division
of
the
caravan
my
missourians
turned
out
to
be
a
pair
of
staunch
hands
who
could
assist
one
another
without
making
a
desperate
affair
of
every
slight
accident
the
grass
had
sprung
up
and
our
mules
and
oxen
instead
of
thinning
down
every
day
grew
fatter
upon
it
moro
therefore
came
in
for
a
better
share
of
the
maize
that
i
had
brought
in
my
waggons
and
which
kept
my
favourite
in
fine
travelling
condition
as
we
approached
the
arkansas
we
saw
mounted
indians
disappearing
over
the
swells
they
were
pawnees
and
for
several
days
clouds
of
these
dusky
warriors
hung
upon
the
skirts
of
the
caravan
but
they
knew
our
strength
and
kept
at
a
wary
distance
from
our
long
rifles
to
me
every
day
brought
something
new
either
in
the
incidents
of
the
voyage
or
the
features
of
the
landscape
gode
who
has
been
by
turns
a
voyageur
a
hunter
a
trapper
and
a
du
in
our
private
dialogues
had
given
me
an
insight
into
many
an
item
of
thus
enabling
me
to
cut
quite
a
respectable
figure
among
my
new
comrades
saint
vrain
too
whose
frank
generous
manner
had
already
won
my
confidence
spared
no
pains
to
make
the
trip
agreeable
to
me
what
with
gallops
by
day
and
the
wilder
tales
by
the
night
i
became
intoxicated
with
the
romance
of
my
new
life
i
had
caught
the
so
my
companions
told
me
laughing
i
did
not
understand
them
then
i
knew
what
they
meant
afterwards
the
prairie
fever
yes
i
was
just
then
in
process
of
being
inoculated
by
that
strange
disease
it
grew
upon
me
apace
the
dreams
of
home
began
to
die
within
me
and
with
these
the
illusory
ideas
of
many
a
young
and
foolish
ambition
my
strength
increased
both
physically
and
intellectually
i
experienced
a
buoyancy
of
spirits
and
a
vigour
of
body
i
had
never
known
before
i
felt
a
pleasure
in
action
my
blood
seemed
to
rush
warmer
and
swifter
through
my
veins
and
i
fancied
that
my
eyes
reached
to
a
more
distant
vision
i
could
look
boldly
upon
the
sun
without
quivering
in
my
glance
had
i
imbibed
a
portion
of
the
divine
essence
that
lives
and
moves
and
has
its
being
in
those
vast
solitudes
who
can
answer
this
chapter
four
a
ride
upon
a
buffalo
bull
we
had
been
out
about
two
weeks
when
we
struck
the
arkansas
bend
about
six
miles
below
the
plum
buttes
here
our
waggons
corralled
and
camped
so
far
we
had
seen
but
little
of
the
buffalo
only
a
stray
bull
or
at
most
two
or
three
together
and
these
shy
it
was
now
the
running
season
but
none
of
the
great
droves
had
crossed
us
yonder
cried
saint
vrain
fresh
hump
for
supper
we
looked
as
indicated
by
our
friend
along
the
escarpment
of
a
low
table
five
dark
objects
broke
the
line
of
the
horizon
a
glance
was
enough
they
were
buffaloes
as
saint
vrain
spoke
we
were
about
slipping
off
our
saddles
back
went
the
girth
buckles
with
a
sneck
down
came
the
stirrups
up
went
we
and
off
in
the
twinkling
of
a
goat
eye
half
a
score
or
so
started
some
like
myself
for
the
sport
while
others
old
hunters
had
the
meat
in
their
eye
we
had
made
but
a
short
day
march
our
horses
were
still
fresh
and
in
three
times
as
many
minutes
the
three
miles
that
lay
between
us
and
the
game
were
reduced
to
one
here
however
we
were
winded
some
of
the
party
like
myself
green
upon
the
prairies
disregarding
advice
had
ridden
straight
ahead
and
the
bulls
snuffed
us
on
the
wind
when
within
a
mile
one
of
them
threw
up
his
shaggy
front
snorted
struck
the
ground
with
his
hoof
rolled
over
rose
up
again
and
dashed
off
at
full
speed
followed
by
his
four
companions
it
remained
to
us
now
either
to
abandon
the
chase
or
put
our
horses
to
their
mettle
and
catch
up
the
latter
course
was
adopted
and
we
galloped
forward
all
at
once
we
found
ourselves
riding
up
to
what
appeared
to
be
a
clay
wall
six
feet
high
it
was
a
stair
between
two
tables
and
ran
right
and
left
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
without
the
semblance
of
a
gap
this
was
an
obstacle
that
caused
us
to
rein
up
and
reflect
some
wheeled
their
horses
and
commenced
riding
back
while
half
a
dozen
of
us
better
mounted
among
whom
were
saint
vrain
and
my
voyageur
gode
not
wishing
to
give
up
the
chase
so
easily
put
to
the
spur
and
cleared
the
scarp
from
this
point
it
caused
us
a
five
miles
gallop
and
our
horses
a
white
sweat
to
come
up
with
the
hindmost
a
young
cow
which
fell
bored
by
a
bullet
from
every
rifle
in
the
party
as
the
others
had
gained
some
distance
ahead
and
we
had
meat
enough
for
all
we
reined
up
and
dismounting
set
about
removing
the
hair
this
operation
was
a
short
one
under
the
skilful
knives
of
the
hunters
we
had
now
leisure
to
look
back
and
calculate
the
distance
we
had
ridden
from
camp
eight
miles
every
inch
cried
one
we
close
to
the
trail
said
saint
vrain
pointing
to
some
old
waggon
tracks
that
marked
the
route
of
the
santa
fe
traders
well
if
we
ride
into
camp
we
shall
have
to
ride
back
in
the
morning
it
will
be
sixteen
extra
miles
for
our
cattle
true
let
us
stay
here
then
here
water
and
grass
there
buffalo
meat
and
yonder
a
waggon
load
of
we
have
our
blankets
what
more
do
we
want
i
say
camp
where
we
are
and
i
and
i
in
a
minute
the
girth
buckles
flew
open
our
saddles
were
lifted
off
and
our
panting
horses
were
cropping
the
curly
bunches
of
the
prairie
grass
within
the
circles
of
their
a
crystal
rivulet
the
arroyo
of
the
spaniards
stole
away
southward
to
the
arkansas
on
the
bank
of
this
rivulet
and
under
one
of
its
bluffs
we
chose
a
spot
for
our
bivouac
the
de
was
collected
a
fire
was
kindled
and
hump
steaks
spitted
on
sticks
were
soon
sputtering
in
the
blaze
luckily
saint
vrain
and
i
had
our
flasks
along
and
as
each
of
them
contained
a
pint
of
pure
cognac
we
managed
to
make
a
tolerable
supper
the
old
hunters
had
their
pipes
and
tobacco
my
friend
and
i
our
cigars
and
we
sat
round
the
ashes
till
a
late
hour
smoking
and
listening
to
wild
tales
of
mountain
adventure
at
length
the
watch
was
told
off
the
lariats
were
shortened
the
driven
home
and
my
comrades
rolling
themselves
up
in
their
blankets
rested
their
heads
in
the
hollow
of
their
saddles
and
went
to
sleep
there
was
a
man
named
hibbets
in
our
party
who
from
his
habits
of
somnolency
had
earned
the
sobriquet
of
for
this
reason
the
first
watch
had
been
assigned
to
him
being
the
least
dangerous
as
indians
seldom
made
their
attacks
until
the
hour
of
soundest
sleep
that
before
daybreak
hibbets
had
climbed
to
his
post
the
top
of
the
bluff
where
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
surrounding
prairie
before
night
had
set
in
i
had
noticed
a
very
beautiful
spot
on
the
bank
of
the
arroyo
about
two
hundred
yards
from
where
my
comrades
lay
a
sudden
fancy
came
into
my
head
to
sleep
there
and
taking
up
my
rifle
robe
and
blanket
at
the
same
time
calling
to
to
awake
me
in
case
of
alarm
i
proceeded
thither
the
ground
shelving
gradually
down
to
the
arroyo
was
covered
with
soft
buffalo
grass
thick
and
dry
as
good
a
bed
as
was
ever
pressed
by
sleepy
mortal
on
this
i
spread
my
robe
and
folding
my
blanket
around
me
lay
down
cigar
in
mouth
to
smoke
myself
asleep
it
was
a
lovely
moonlight
so
clear
that
i
could
easily
distinguish
the
colours
of
the
prairie
flowers
the
silver
euphorbias
the
golden
sunflowers
and
the
scarlet
malvas
that
fringed
the
banks
of
the
arroyo
at
my
feet
there
was
an
enchanting
stillness
in
the
air
broken
only
by
an
occasional
whine
from
the
prairie
wolf
the
distant
snoring
of
my
companions
and
the
crop
crop
of
our
horses
shortening
the
crisp
grass
i
lay
a
good
while
awake
until
my
cigar
burnt
up
to
my
lips
we
smoke
them
close
on
the
prairies
then
spitting
out
the
stump
i
turned
over
on
my
side
and
was
soon
in
the
land
of
dreams
i
could
not
have
been
asleep
many
minutes
when
i
felt
sensible
of
a
strange
noise
like
distant
thunder
or
the
roaring
of
a
waterfall
the
ground
seemed
to
tremble
beneath
me
we
are
going
to
have
a
dash
of
a
thought
i
still
to
impressions
from
without
and
i
drew
the
folds
of
my
blanket
closer
around
me
and
again
slept
i
was
awakened
by
a
noise
like
thunder
indeed
like
the
trampling
of
a
thousand
hoofs
and
the
lowing
of
a
thousand
oxen
the
earth
echoed
and
trembled
i
could
hear
the
shouts
of
my
comrades
the
voices
of
saint
vrain
and
gode
the
latter
calling
out
monsieur
prenez
garde
des
buffles
i
saw
that
they
had
drawn
the
horses
and
were
hurrying
them
under
the
bluff
i
sprang
to
my
feet
flinging
aside
my
blanket
a
fearful
spectacle
was
before
me
away
to
the
west
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
prairie
seemed
in
motion
black
waves
rolled
over
its
undulating
outlines
as
though
some
burning
mountain
were
pouring
down
its
lava
upon
the
plains
a
thousand
bright
spots
flashed
and
flitted
along
the
moving
surface
like
jets
of
fire
the
ground
shook
men
shouted
horses
reared
upon
their
ropes
neighing
wildly
my
dog
barked
and
bowled
running
around
me
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
but
no
the
scene
was
too
real
to
be
mistaken
for
a
vision
i
saw
the
border
of
a
black
wave
within
ten
paces
of
me
and
still
approaching
then
and
not
till
then
did
i
recognise
the
shaggy
crests
and
glaring
eyeballs
of
the
buffalo
oh
god
i
am
in
their
track
i
shall
be
trampled
to
death
it
was
too
late
to
attempt
an
escape
by
running
i
seized
my
rifle
and
fired
at
the
foremost
of
the
band
the
effect
of
my
shot
was
not
perceptible
the
water
of
the
arroyo
was
dashed
in
my
face
a
huge
bull
ahead
of
the
rest
furious
and
snorting
plunged
through
the
stream
and
up
the
slope
i
was
lifted
and
tossed
high
into
the
air
i
was
thrown
rearwards
and
fell
upon
a
moving
mass
i
did
not
feel
hurt
or
stunned
i
felt
myself
carried
onward
upon
the
backs
of
several
animals
that
in
the
dense
drove
ran
close
together
these
frightened
at
their
strange
burden
bellowed
loudly
and
dashed
on
to
the
front
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
and
fixing
on
that
which
was
most
under
me
i
dropped
my
legs
astride
of
him
embracing
his
hump
and
clutching
the
long
woolly
hair
that
grew
upon
his
neck
the
animal
routed
with
extreme
terror
and
plunging
forward
soon
headed
the
band
this
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
and
on
we
went
over
the
prairie
the
bull
running
at
top
speed
believing
no
doubt
that
he
had
a
panther
or
a
catamount
between
his
shoulders
i
had
no
desire
to
disabuse
him
of
this
belief
and
lest
he
should
deem
me
altogether
harmless
and
come
to
a
halt
i
slipped
out
my
bowie
which
happened
to
be
handy
and
pricked
him
up
whenever
he
showed
symptoms
of
lagging
at
every
fresh
touch
of
the
spur
he
roared
out
and
ran
forward
at
a
redoubled
pace
my
danger
was
still
extreme
the
drove
was
coming
on
behind
with
the
front
of
nearly
a
mile
i
could
not
have
cleared
it
had
the
bull
stopped
and
left
me
on
the
prairie
nothwithstanding
the
peril
i
was
in
i
could
not
resist
laughing
at
my
ludicrous
situation
i
felt
as
one
does
when
looking
at
a
good
comedy
we
struck
through
a
village
of
prairie
dogs
here
i
fancied
the
animal
was
about
to
turn
and
run
back
this
brought
my
mirth
to
a
sudden
pause
but
the
buffalo
usually
runs
in
a
and
fortunately
mine
made
no
exception
to
the
law
on
he
went
sinking
to
the
knees
kicking
the
dust
from
the
conical
hills
snorting
and
bellowing
with
rage
and
terror
the
plum
buttes
were
directly
in
the
line
or
our
course
i
had
seen
this
from
the
start
and
knew
that
if
i
could
reach
them
i
would
be
safe
they
were
nearly
three
miles
from
the
bluff
where
we
had
bivouacked
but
in
my
ride
i
fancied
them
ten
a
small
one
rose
over
the
prairie
several
hundred
yards
nearer
than
the
main
heights
towards
this
i
pricked
the
foaming
bull
in
a
last
stretch
and
he
brought
me
cleverly
within
a
hundred
yards
of
its
base
it
was
now
time
to
take
leave
of
my
dusky
companion
i
could
have
slaughtered
him
as
i
leaned
over
his
back
my
knife
rested
upon
the
most
vulnerable
part
of
his
huge
body
no
i
could
not
have
slain
that
buffalo
for
the
untwisting
my
fingers
from
his
thick
fleece
i
slipped
down
over
his
tail
and
without
as
much
as
saying
goodnight
ran
with
all
my
speed
towards
the
knoll
i
climbed
up
and
sitting
down
upon
a
loose
boulder
of
rock
looked
over
the
prairie
the
moon
was
still
shining
brightly
my
late
companion
had
halted
not
far
from
where
i
had
left
him
and
stood
glaring
back
with
an
air
of
extreme
bewilderment
there
was
something
so
comical
in
the
sight
that
i
yelled
with
laughter
as
i
sat
securely
on
my
perch
i
looked
to
the
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
prairie
was
black
and
moving
the
living
wave
came
rolling
onward
and
toward
me
but
i
could
now
observe
it
in
safety
the
myriads
of
glancing
eyes
sparkling
like
phosphoric
gleams
no
longer
flashed
terror
the
drove
was
still
half
a
mile
distant
i
thought
i
saw
quick
gleams
and
heard
the
report
of
firearms
away
over
its
left
border
but
i
could
not
be
certain
i
had
begun
to
think
of
the
fate
of
my
comrades
and
this
gave
me
hopes
that
they
were
safe
the
buffaloes
approached
the
butte
on
which
i
was
seated
and
perceiving
the
obstacle
suddenly
forked
into
two
great
belts
and
swept
right
and
left
around
it
what
struck
me
at
this
moment
as
curious
was
that
my
bull
my
particular
bull
instead
of
waiting
till
his
comrades
had
come
up
and
falling
in
among
the
foremost
suddenly
tossed
up
his
head
and
galloped
off
as
if
a
pack
of
wolves
had
been
after
him
he
ran
towards
the
outside
of
the
band
when
he
had
reached
a
point
that
placed
him
fairly
beyond
the
flank
i
could
see
him
closing
in
and
moving
on
with
the
rest
this
strange
tactic
of
my
late
companion
puzzled
me
at
the
time
but
i
afterwards
learned
that
it
was
sound
strategy
on
his
part
had
he
remained
where
i
had
parted
with
him
the
foremost
bulls
coming
up
would
have
mistaken
him
for
an
individual
of
some
other
tribe
and
would
certainly
have
gored
him
to
death
i
sat
upon
the
rock
for
nearly
two
hours
silently
watching
the
sable
stream
as
it
poured
past
i
was
on
an
island
in
the
midst
of
a
black
and
glittering
sea
at
one
time
i
fancied
i
was
moving
that
the
butte
was
sailing
onward
and
the
buffaloes
were
standing
still
my
head
swam
with
dizziness
and
i
leaped
to
my
feet
to
drive
away
the
strange
illusion
the
torrent
rolled
onward
and
at
length
the
hindmost
went
straggling
past
i
descended
from
the
knoll
and
commenced
groping
my
way
over
the
black
trodden
earth
what
was
lately
a
green
sward
now
presented
the
aspect
of
ground
freshly
ploughed
and
trampled
by
droves
of
oxen
a
number
of
white
animals
resembling
a
flock
of
sheep
passed
near
me
they
were
wolves
hanging
upon
the
skirts
of
the
herd
i
pushed
on
keeping
to
the
southward
at
length
i
heard
voices
and
in
the
clear
moonlight
could
see
several
horsemen
galloping
in
circles
over
the
plain
i
shouted
hollo
a
voice
answered
mine
and
one
of
the
horsemen
came
galloping
up
it
was
saint
vrain
why
bless
me
haller
cried
he
reining
up
and
bending
from
his
saddle
to
get
a
better
view
of
me
is
it
you
or
your
ghost
as
i
sit
here
it
the
man
himself
and
alive
never
in
better
condition
i
replied
but
where
did
you
come
from
the
clouds
the
sky
where
and
his
questions
were
echoed
by
the
others
who
at
this
moment
were
shaking
me
by
the
hand
as
if
they
had
not
seen
me
for
a
twelvemonth
gode
seemed
to
be
the
most
perplexed
man
of
the
party
mon
dieu
run
over
tramp
by
von
million
buffles
et
ne
pas
mort
matin
we
were
hunting
for
your
body
or
rather
the
fragments
of
it
said
saint
vrain
we
had
searched
every
foot
of
the
prairie
for
a
mile
round
and
had
almost
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fierce
brutes
had
eaten
you
up
eat
monsieur
up
no
tre
million
buffles
no
him
eat
mon
dieu
ha
this
exclamation
of
the
canadian
was
addressed
to
hibbets
who
had
failed
to
warn
my
comrades
of
where
i
lay
and
thus
placed
me
in
such
a
dangerous
predicament
we
saw
you
tossed
in
the
air
continued
saint
vrain
and
fall
right
into
the
thick
of
them
then
of
course
we
gave
you
up
but
how
in
heaven
name
have
you
got
clear
i
related
my
adventure
to
my
wondering
comrades
par
dieu
cried
gode
un
garcon
tres
bizarre
une
aventure
tres
merveilleuse
from
that
hour
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
captain
on
the
prairies
my
comrades
had
made
good
work
of
it
as
a
dozen
dark
objects
that
lay
upon
the
plain
testified
they
had
found
my
rifle
and
blankets
the
latter
trodden
into
the
earth
saint
vrain
had
still
a
few
drops
in
his
flask
and
after
swallowing
these
and
again
placing
the
guard
we
returned
to
our
prairie
couches
and
slept
out
the
night
chapter
five
in
a
bad
fix
a
few
days
afterwards
another
adventure
befell
me
and
i
began
to
think
that
i
was
destined
to
become
a
hero
among
the
mountain
men
a
small
party
of
the
traders
myself
among
the
number
had
pushed
forward
ahead
of
the
caravan
our
object
was
to
arrive
at
santa
fe
a
day
or
two
before
the
waggons
in
order
to
have
everything
arranged
with
the
governor
for
their
entrance
into
that
capital
we
took
the
route
by
the
cimmaron
our
road
for
a
hundred
miles
or
so
lay
through
a
barren
desert
without
game
and
almost
without
water
the
buffalo
had
already
disappeared
and
deer
were
equally
scarce
we
had
to
content
ourselves
with
the
dried
meat
which
we
had
brought
from
the
settlements
we
were
in
the
deserts
of
the
artemisia
now
and
then
we
could
see
a
stray
antelope
bounding
away
before
us
but
keeping
far
out
of
range
they
too
seemed
to
be
unusually
shy
on
the
third
day
after
leaving
the
caravan
as
we
were
riding
near
the
cimmaron
i
thought
i
observed
a
pronged
head
disappearing
behind
a
swell
in
the
prairie
my
companions
were
sceptical
and
none
of
them
would
go
with
me
so
wheeling
out
of
the
trail
i
started
alone
one
of
the
men
for
gode
was
behind
kept
charge
of
my
dog
as
i
did
not
choose
to
take
him
with
me
lest
he
might
alarm
the
antelopes
my
horse
was
fresh
and
willing
and
whether
successful
or
not
i
knew
that
i
could
easily
overtake
the
party
by
i
struck
directly
towards
the
spot
where
i
had
seen
the
object
it
appeared
to
be
only
half
a
mile
or
so
from
the
trail
it
proved
more
distant
a
common
illusion
in
the
crystal
atmosphere
of
these
upland
regions
a
ridge
a
des
on
a
small
scale
traversed
the
plain
from
east
to
west
a
thicket
of
cactus
covered
part
of
its
summit
towards
this
thicket
i
directed
myself
i
dismounted
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
leading
my
horse
silently
up
among
the
cacti
plants
tied
him
to
one
of
their
branches
i
then
crept
cautiously
through
the
thorny
leaves
towards
the
point
where
i
fancied
i
had
seen
the
game
to
my
joy
not
one
antelope
but
a
brace
of
those
beautiful
animals
were
quietly
grazing
beyond
but
alas
too
far
off
for
the
range
of
my
rifle
they
were
fully
three
hundred
yards
distant
upon
a
smooth
grassy
slope
there
was
not
even
a
sage
bush
to
cover
me
should
i
attempt
to
approach
them
what
was
to
be
done
i
lay
for
several
minutes
thinking
over
the
different
tricks
known
in
for
taking
the
antelope
should
i
imitate
their
call
should
i
hoist
my
handkerchief
and
try
to
lure
them
up
i
saw
that
they
were
too
shy
for
at
short
intervals
they
threw
up
their
graceful
heads
and
looked
inquiringly
around
them
i
remembered
the
red
blanket
on
my
saddle
i
could
display
this
upon
the
cactus
bushes
perhaps
it
would
attract
them
i
had
no
alternative
and
was
turning
to
go
back
for
the
blanket
when
all
at
once
my
eye
rested
upon
a
line
running
across
the
prairie
beyond
where
the
animals
were
feeding
it
was
a
break
in
the
surface
of
the
plain
a
buffalo
road
or
the
channel
of
an
arroyo
in
either
case
the
very
cover
i
wanted
for
the
animals
were
not
a
hundred
yards
from
it
and
were
getting
still
nearer
to
it
as
they
fed
creeping
back
out
of
the
thicket
i
ran
along
the
side
of
the
slope
towards
a
point
where
i
had
noticed
that
the
ridge
was
depressed
to
the
prairie
level
here
to
my
surprise
i
found
myself
on
the
banks
of
a
broad
arroyo
whose
water
clear
and
shallow
ran
slowly
over
a
bed
of
sand
and
gypsum
the
banks
were
low
not
over
three
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
except
where
the
ridge
impinged
upon
the
stream
here
there
was
a
high
bluff
and
hurrying
round
its
base
i
entered
the
channel
and
commenced
wading
upward
as
i
had
anticipated
i
soon
came
to
a
bend
where
the
stream
after
running
parallel
to
the
ridge
swept
round
and
canoned
through
it
at
this
place
i
stopped
and
looked
cautiously
over
the
bank
the
antelopes
had
approached
within
less
than
rifle
range
of
the
arroyo
but
they
were
yet
far
above
my
position
they
were
still
quietly
feeding
and
unconscious
of
danger
i
again
bent
down
and
waded
on
it
was
a
difficult
task
proceeding
in
this
way
the
bed
of
the
creek
was
soft
and
yielding
and
i
was
compelled
to
tread
slowly
and
silently
lest
i
should
alarm
the
game
but
i
was
cheered
in
my
exertions
by
the
prospect
of
fresh
venison
for
my
supper
after
a
weary
drag
of
several
hundred
yards
i
came
opposite
to
a
small
clump
of
wormwood
bushes
growing
out
of
the
bank
i
may
be
high
enough
thought
i
these
will
serve
for
cover
i
raised
my
body
gradually
until
i
could
see
through
the
leaves
i
was
in
the
right
spot
i
brought
my
rifle
to
a
level
sighted
for
the
heart
of
the
buck
and
fired
the
animal
leaped
from
the
ground
and
fell
back
lifeless
i
was
about
to
rush
forward
and
secure
my
prize
when
i
observed
the
doe
instead
of
running
off
as
i
had
expected
go
up
to
her
fallen
partner
and
press
her
tapering
nose
to
his
body
she
was
not
more
than
twenty
yards
from
me
and
i
could
plainly
see
that
her
look
was
one
of
inquiry
and
bewilderment
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
comprehend
the
fatal
truth
and
throwing
back
her
head
commenced
uttering
the
most
piteous
cries
at
the
same
time
running
in
circles
around
the
body
i
stood
wavering
between
two
minds
my
first
impulse
had
been
to
reload
and
kill
the
doe
but
her
plaintive
voice
entered
my
heart
disarming
me
of
all
hostile
intentions
had
i
dreamt
of
witnessing
this
painful
spectacle
i
should
not
have
left
the
trail
but
the
mischief
was
now
done
i
have
worse
than
killed
her
thought
i
it
will
be
better
to
despatch
her
at
once
actuated
by
these
principles
of
a
common
but
to
her
fatal
humanity
i
rested
the
butt
of
my
rifle
and
reloaded
with
a
faltering
hand
i
again
levelled
the
piece
and
fired
my
nerves
were
steady
enough
to
do
the
work
when
the
smoke
floated
aside
i
could
see
the
little
creature
bleeding
upon
the
grass
her
head
resting
against
the
body
of
her
murdered
mate
i
shouldered
my
rifle
and
was
about
to
move
forward
when
to
my
astonishment
i
found
that
i
was
caught
by
the
feet
i
was
held
firmly
as
if
my
legs
had
been
screwed
in
a
vice
i
made
an
effort
to
extricate
myself
another
more
violent
and
equally
unsuccessful
and
with
a
third
i
lost
my
balance
and
fell
back
upon
the
water
i
regained
my
upright
position
but
only
to
find
that
i
was
held
as
fast
as
ever
again
i
struggled
to
free
my
limbs
i
could
neither
move
them
backward
nor
forward
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
and
i
became
sensible
that
i
was
gradually
going
down
then
the
fearful
truth
flashed
upon
me
i
was
sinking
in
a
quicksand
a
feeling
of
horror
came
over
me
i
renewed
my
efforts
with
the
energy
of
desperation
i
leant
to
one
side
then
to
the
other
almost
wrenching
my
knees
from
their
sockets
my
feet
remained
fast
as
ever
i
could
not
move
them
an
inch
the
soft
clinging
sand
already
overtopped
my
horseskin
boots
wedging
them
around
my
ankles
so
that
i
was
unable
to
draw
them
off
and
i
could
feel
that
i
was
still
sinking
slowly
but
surely
as
though
some
subterranean
monster
were
leisurely
dragging
me
down
this
very
thought
caused
me
a
fresh
thrill
of
horror
and
i
called
aloud
for
help
to
whom
there
was
no
one
within
miles
of
me
no
living
thing
yes
the
neigh
of
my
horse
answered
me
from
the
hill
mocking
my
despair
i
bent
forward
as
well
as
my
constrained
position
would
permit
and
with
frenzied
fingers
commenced
tearing
up
the
sand
i
could
barely
reach
the
surface
and
the
little
hollow
i
was
able
to
make
filled
up
almost
as
soon
as
it
had
been
formed
a
thought
occurred
to
me
my
rifle
might
support
me
placed
horizontally
i
looked
around
for
it
it
was
not
to
be
seen
it
had
sunk
beneath
the
sand
could
i
throw
my
body
flat
and
prevent
myself
from
sinking
deeper
no
the
water
was
two
feet
in
depth
i
should
drown
at
once
this
last
last
hope
left
me
as
soon
as
formed
i
could
think
of
no
plan
to
save
myself
i
could
make
no
further
effort
a
strange
stupor
seized
upon
me
my
very
thoughts
became
paralysed
i
knew
that
i
was
going
mad
for
a
moment
i
was
mad
after
an
interval
my
senses
returned
i
made
an
effort
to
rouse
my
mind
from
its
paralysis
in
order
that
i
might
meet
death
which
i
now
believed
to
be
certain
as
a
man
should
i
stood
erect
my
eyes
had
sunk
to
the
prairie
level
and
rested
upon
the
still
bleeding
victims
of
my
cruelty
my
heart
smote
me
at
the
sight
was
i
suffering
a
retribution
of
god
with
humble
and
penitent
thoughts
i
turned
my
face
to
heaven
almost
dreading
that
some
sign
of
omnipotent
anger
would
scowl
upon
me
from
above
but
no
the
sun
was
shining
as
brightly
as
ever
and
the
blue
canopy
of
the
world
was
without
a
cloud
i
gazed
upward
and
prayed
with
an
earnestness
known
only
to
the
hearts
of
men
in
positions
of
peril
like
mine
as
i
continued
to
look
up
an
object
attracted
my
attention
against
the
sky
i
distinguished
the
outlines
of
a
large
bird
i
knew
it
to
be
the
obscene
bird
of
the
plains
the
buzzard
vulture
whence
had
it
come
who
knows
far
beyond
the
reach
of
human
eye
it
had
seen
or
scented
the
slaughtered
antelopes
and
on
broad
silent
wing
was
now
descending
to
the
feast
of
death
presently
another
and
another
and
many
others
mottled
the
blue
field
of
the
heavens
curving
and
wheeling
silently
earthward
then
the
foremost
swooped
down
upon
the
bank
and
after
gazing
around
for
a
moment
flapped
off
towards
its
prey
in
a
few
seconds
the
prairie
was
black
with
filthy
birds
which
clambered
over
the
dead
antelopes
and
beat
their
wings
against
each
other
while
they
tore
out
the
eyes
of
the
quarry
with
their
fetid
beaks
and
now
came
gaunt
wolves
sneaking
and
hungry
stealing
out
of
the
cactus
thicket
and
loping
over
the
green
swells
of
the
prairie
these
after
a
battle
drove
away
the
vultures
and
tore
up
the
prey
all
the
while
growling
and
snapping
vengefully
at
each
other
thank
heaven
i
shall
at
least
be
saved
from
this
i
was
soon
relieved
from
the
sight
my
eyes
had
sunk
below
the
level
of
the
bank
i
had
looked
my
last
on
the
fair
green
earth
i
could
now
see
only
the
clayey
walls
that
contained
the
river
and
the
water
that
ran
unheeding
by
me
once
more
i
fixed
my
gaze
upon
the
sky
and
with
prayerful
heart
endeavoured
to
resign
myself
to
my
fate
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
be
calm
the
memories
of
earthly
pleasures
and
friends
and
home
came
over
me
causing
me
at
intervals
to
break
into
wild
paroxysms
and
make
fresh
though
fruitless
struggles
again
i
was
attracted
by
the
neighing
of
my
horse
a
thought
entered
my
mind
filling
me
with
fresh
hopes
perhaps
my
horse
i
lost
not
a
moment
i
raised
my
voice
to
its
highest
pitch
and
called
the
animal
by
name
i
knew
that
he
would
come
at
my
call
i
had
tied
him
but
slightly
the
cactus
limb
would
snap
off
i
called
again
repeating
words
that
were
well
known
to
him
i
listened
with
a
bounding
heart
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
i
heard
the
quick
sounds
of
his
hoofs
as
though
the
animal
were
rearing
and
struggling
to
free
himself
then
i
could
distinguish
the
stroke
of
his
heels
in
a
measured
and
regular
gallop
nearer
came
the
sounds
nearer
and
clearer
until
the
gallant
brute
appeared
upon
the
bank
above
me
there
he
halted
and
flinging
back
his
tossed
mane
uttered
a
shrill
neigh
he
was
bewildered
and
looked
to
every
side
snorting
loudly
i
knew
that
having
once
seen
me
he
would
not
stop
until
he
had
pressed
his
nose
against
my
cheek
for
this
was
his
usual
custom
holding
out
my
hands
i
again
uttered
the
magic
words
now
glancing
downward
he
perceived
me
and
stretching
himself
sprang
out
into
the
channel
the
next
moment
i
held
him
by
the
bridle
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
i
was
still
going
down
and
my
armpits
were
fast
nearing
the
surface
of
the
quicksand
i
caught
the
lariat
and
passing
it
under
the
fastened
it
in
a
tight
firm
knot
i
then
looped
the
trailing
end
making
it
secure
around
my
body
i
had
left
enough
of
the
rope
between
the
and
the
girths
to
enable
me
to
check
and
guide
the
animal
in
case
the
drag
upon
my
body
should
be
too
painful
all
this
while
the
dumb
brute
seemed
to
comprehend
what
i
was
about
he
knew
too
the
nature
of
the
ground
on
which
he
stood
for
during
the
operation
he
kept
lifting
his
feet
alternately
to
prevent
himself
from
sinking
my
arrangements
were
at
length
completed
and
with
a
feeling
of
terrible
anxiety
i
gave
my
horse
the
signal
to
move
forward
instead
of
going
off
with
a
start
the
intelligent
animal
stepped
away
slowly
as
though
he
understood
my
situation
the
lariat
tightened
i
felt
my
body
moving
and
the
next
moment
experienced
a
wild
delight
a
feeling
i
can
not
describe
as
i
found
myself
dragged
out
of
the
sand
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
a
shout
of
joy
i
rushed
up
to
my
steed
and
throwing
my
arms
around
his
neck
kissed
him
he
answered
my
embrace
with
a
low
whimper
that
told
me
i
was
understood
i
looked
for
my
rifle
fortunately
it
had
not
sunk
deeply
and
i
soon
found
it
my
boots
were
behind
me
but
i
stayed
not
to
look
for
them
being
smitten
with
a
wholesome
dread
of
the
place
where
i
had
left
them
it
was
sundown
before
i
reached
camp
where
i
was
met
by
the
inquiries
of
my
wondering
companions
did
you
come
across
the
where
your
boots
whether
have
you
been
hunting
or
fishing
i
answered
all
these
questions
by
relating
my
adventures
and
that
night
i
was
again
the
hero
of
the
chapter
six
santa
fe
after
a
week
climbing
through
the
rocky
mountains
we
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
del
norte
and
arrived
at
the
capital
of
new
mexico
the
santa
fe
next
day
the
caravan
itself
came
in
for
we
had
lost
time
on
the
southern
route
and
the
waggons
travelling
by
the
raton
pass
had
made
a
good
journey
of
it
we
had
no
difficulty
about
their
entrance
into
the
country
with
the
proviso
that
we
paid
five
hundred
dollars
of
alcavala
tax
upon
each
waggon
this
was
a
greater
extortion
than
usual
but
the
traders
were
compelled
to
accept
the
impost
santa
fe
is
the
entrepot
of

and

of

on
reaching
it
we
halted
camping
without
the
walls
saint

several
other
and
myself
took
up
our
quarters
at
the
fonda
where
we
endeavoured
by
means
of
the
sparkling
vintage
of
el
paso
to
make
ourselves
oblivious
of
the
hardships
we
had
endured
in
the
passage
of
the
plains
the
night
of
our
arrival
was
given
to
feasting
and
making
merry
next
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
voice
of

of
these
new
mexican
grapes

do
you
think
the
yankees
have
an
eye
to
this
quarter
think
i
know
it
and
why
not
what
use
are
these
manikins
in
creation
only
to
cumber
the
earth
well
mozo

have
brought
the
coffee
ya
esta
senor
here
try
some
of
this
it
will
help
to
set
you
on
your
feet
they
can
make
coffee
and
no
mistake
it
takes
a
spaniard
to
do
that
what
is
this
fandango
gode
has
been
telling
me
about
ah
true
we
are
to
have
a
famous
one
you
go
of
course
out
of
curiosity
very
well
you
will
have
your
curiosity
gratified
the
blustering
old
grampus
of
a
governor
is
to
honour
the
ball
with
his
presence
and
it
is
said
his
pretty
senora
that
i
do
believe
why
not
he
too
much
afraid
lest
one
of
these
wild
americanos
might
whip
her
off
on
the
cantle
of
his
saddle
such
things
have
been
done
in
this
very
valley
by
saint
mary
she
is
continued
saint
vrain
in
a
and
i
knew
a
man
the
cursed
old
tyrant
only
think
of
it
of
what
the
way
he
has
bled
us
five
hundred
dollars
a
waggon
and
a
hundred
of
them
at
that
in
all
fifty
thousand
dollars
but
will
he
pocket
all
this
will
not
the
government
government
no
every
cent
of
it
he
is
the
government
here
and
with
the
help
of
this
instalment
he
will
rule
these
miserable
wretches
with
an
iron
rod
and
yet
they
hate
him
do
they
not
him
and
his
and
they
have
reason
it
is
strange
they
do
not
rebel
they
have
at
times
but
what
can
they
do
like
all
true
tyrants
he
has
divided
them
and
makes
them
spend
their
heart
hatred
on
one
another
but
he
seems
not
to
have
a
very
large
army
no
bodyguard
bodyguard
cried
saint
vrain
interrupting
me
look
out
there
his
bodyguard
indios
bravos
les
navajoes
exclaimed
gode
at
the
same
instant
i
looked
forth
into
the
street
half
a
dozen
tall
savages
wrapped
in
striped
serapes
were
passing
their
wild
hungry
looks
and
slow
proud
walk
at
once
distinguished
them
from
indios
manzos
the
pueblos
are
they
navajoes
i
asked
oui
monsieur
oui
replied
gode
apparently
with
some
excitement
navajoes
there
no
mistaking
them
added
saint
vrain
but
the
navajoes
are
the
notorious
enemies
of
the
new
mexicans
how
come
they
to
be
here
prisoners
do
they
look
like
prisoners
they
certainly
showed
no
signs
of
captivity
in
either
look
or
gesture
they
strode
proudly
up
the
street
occasionally
glancing
at
the
passers
with
an
air
of
savage
and
lordly
contempt
why
then
are
they
here
their
country
lies
far
to
the
west
that
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
nuevo
mexico
about
which
i
will
enlighten
you
some
other
time
they
are
now
protected
by
a
treaty
of
peace
which
is
only
binding
upon
them
so
long
as
it
may
suit
their
convenience
to
recognise
it
at
present
they
are
as
free
here
as
you
or
i
indeed
more
so
when
it
comes
to
that
i
would
wonder
it
we
were
to
meet
them
at
the
fandango
i
have
heard
that
the
navajoes
are
cannibals
it
is
true
look
at
them
this
minute
see
how
they
gloat
upon
that
chubby
little
fellow
who
seems
instinctively
to
fear
them
lucky
for
the
urchin
it
broad
daylight
or
he
might
get
chucked
under
one
of
those
striped
blankets
are
you
in
earnest
saint
vrain
by
my
word
i
am
not
jesting
if
i
mistake
not
gode
experience
will
confirm
what
i
have
said

it
is
quite
true
both
apaches
and
navajoes
carry
off
children
from
the
valley
here
in
their
grand
forays
and
it
is
said
by
those
who
should
know
that
most
of
them
are
used
in
that
way
whether
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
fiery
god
quetzalcoatl
or
whether
from
a
fondness
lor
human
flesh
no
one
has
yet
been
able
to
determine
in
fact
with
all
their
propinquity
to
this
place
there
is
little
known
about
them
few
who
have
visited
their
towns
have
had
gode
luck
to
get
away
again
no
man
of
these

ever
ventures

so
saying
the
canadian
lifted
his
cap
and
along
with
it
what
i
had
up
to
this
time
looked
upon
as
a
beautiful
curling
head
of
hair
but
which
now
proved
to
be
only
a

i
were
unable

restrain
our
laughter
at
the

comical
appearance
of
the
canadian
come
gode
the
least
you
can
do
after
that
is
to

help
yourself
monsieur

the

quaffed

but
we
have
some

and
you
think
we
shall
go
there
certainly
they
do
not
want
the
fourth
part
of
our
stuff
here
we
must
carry
it
on

chapter
seven
the
fandango
in
the
evening
i
sat
in
my
room
waiting
for
saint
vrain
his
voice
reached
me
from
without
ninas

ha
are
you
ready
my
bold
rider
not
quite
sit
down
a
minute
and
wait
hurry
then
the
dancing
begun
i
have
just
come
that
way
what
that
your
ha
ha
ha
screamed
saint
vrain
seeing
me
unpack
a
blue
coat
and
a
pair
of
dark
pantaloons
in
a
tolerable
state
of
preservation
why
yes
replied
i
looking
up
what
fault
do
you
find
but
is
that
your
no
change
had
taken
place
in
the
ordinary
raiment
of
my
friend
the
fringed
and
leggings
the
belt
the
bowie
and
the
pistols
were
all
before
me
yes
my
dandy
this
is
my
it
ai
anything
shorter
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
wear
what
you
have
got
on
your
back
how
will
your
blue
look
with
a
broad
belt
and
bowie
strapped
round
the
skirts
ha
ha
ha
but
why
take
either
belt
or
bowie
you
are
surely
not
going
into
a
with
your
pistols
in
that
fashion
and
how
else
should
i
carry
them
in
my
hands
leave
them
here
ha

that
would
be
a
green
trick
no
no
once
bit
twice
shy
you
do
catch
this
going
into
any
fandango
in
santa

without
his
come
keep
on
that
shirt
let
your
leggings
sweat
where
they
are
and
buckle
this
about
you

if
you
assure
me
that
my
dress
will
be

the
blue
i
promise
you
the
blue
was
restored
forthwith
to
its
nook
in
my
portmanteau
saint
vrain
was
right
on
arriving
at
the
room
a
large
sala
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
plaza
we
found
it
filled
with
hunters
trappers
traders
and
teamsters
all
swaggering
about
in
their
usual
mountain
rig
mixed
among
them
were
some
two
or
three
score
of
the
natives
with
an
equal
number
of
senoritas
all
of
whom
by
their
style
of
dress
i
recognise
as
poblanas
or
persons
of
the
lower
class
the
only
class
in
fact
to
be
met
with
in
santa
fe
as
we
entered
most
of
the
men
had
thrown
aside
their
serapes
for
the
dance
and
appeared
in
all
the
finery
of
embroidered
velvet
stamped
leather
and
shining
castletops
the
women
looked
not
less
picturesque
in
their
bright
naguas
snowy
chemisettes
and
small
satin
slippers
some
of
them
flounced
it
in
polka
jackets
for
even
to
that
remote
region
the
famous
dance
had
found
its
way
have
you
heard
of
the
electric
telegraph
no

me
what
a

the
was
a
long
oblong
sala
with
a
banquette
running
all
round
it
upon
this
the
dancers
seated
themselves
drew
out
their
husk
cigarettes
chatted
and
smoked
during
the
intervals
of
the
dance
in
one
corner
half
a
dozen
sons
of
orpheus
twanged
away
upon
harp
guitar
and
bandolin
occasionally
helping
out
the
music
with
a
shrill
chant
in
another
angle
of
the
apartment
puros
and
taos
whisky
were
dealt
out
to
the
thirsty
mountaineers
who
made
the
sala
ring
with
their
wild
ejaculations
there
were
scenes
like
the
following

an
arrival
at
this
moment
caused
a
sensation
in
the
room
a
stout
fat
man
entered
accompanied
by
several
others
it
was
the
governor
and
his
suite
with
a
number
of
citizens
who
were
no
doubt
the
elite
of
new
mexican
society
some
of
the
were
militaires
dressed
in
gaudy
and
uniforms
that
were
soon
seen
spinning
round
the
room
in
the
mazes
of
the
waltz
where
is
the
senora
armijo
i
whispered
to
saint
vrain
i
told
you
as
much
she
she
wo
be
out
stay
here
i
am
going
for
a
short
while
help
yourself
to
a
partner
and
see
some
tun
i
will
be
back
presently
without
any
further
explanation
saint
vrain
squeezed
himself
through
the
crowd
and
disappeared
i
had
been
seated
on
the
banquette
since
entering
the
sala
saint
vrain
beside
me
in
a
retired
corner
of
the
room
a
man
of
peculiar
appearance
occupied
the
seat
next
to
saint
vrain
but
farther
into
the
shadow
of
a
piece
of
furniture
i
had
noticed
this
man
as
we
entered
and
noticed
too
that
saint
vrain
spoke
to
him
but
i
was
not
introduced
and
the
interposition
of
my
friend
prevented
me
from
making
any
further
observation
of
him
until
the
latter
had
retired
we
were
now
side
by
side
and
i
commenced
a
sort
of
angular
reconnaissance
of
a
face
and
figure
that
had
somewhat
strangely
arrested
my
attention
he
was
not
an
american
that
was
evident
from
his
dress
and
yet
the
face
was
not
mexican
its
outlines
were
too
bold
for
a
spanish
face
though
the
complexion
from
tan
and
exposure
was
brown
and
swarth
his
face
was
except
his
chin
which
carried
a
pointed
darkish
beard
the
eye
if
i
saw
it
aright
under
the
shadow
of
a
slouched
brim
was
blue
and
mild
the
hair
brown
and
wavy
with
here
and
there
a
strand
of
silver
these
were
not
spanish
characteristics
much
less
and
i
should
have
at
once
placed
my
neighbour
elsewhere
but
that
his
dress
puzzled
me
it
was
purely
a
mexican
costume
and
consisted
of
a
purple
manga
with
dark
velvet
embroidery
around
the
vent
and
along
the
borders
as
this
garment
covered
the
greater
part
of
his
person
i
could
only
see
that
underneath
was
a
pair
of
green
velveteen
calzoneros
with
yellow
buttons
and
calzoncillos
puffing
out
along
the
seams
the
bottoms
of
the
calzoneros
were
trimmed
with
stamped
black
leather
and
under
these
were
yellow
boots
with
a
heavy
steel
spur
upon
the
heel
of
each
the
broad
peaked
strap
that
confined
the
spur
passing
over
the
foot
gave
to
it
that
peculiar
contour
that
we
observe
in
the
pictures
of
armed
knights
of
the
olden
time
he
wore
a
black
sombrero
girdled
by
a
thick
band
of
gold
bullion
a
pair
of
tags
of
the
same
material
stuck
out
from
the
sides
the
fashion
of
the
country
the
man
kept
his
sombrero
slouched
towards
the
light
as
i
thought
or
suspected
for
the
concealment
of
his
face
and
vet
it
was
not
an
one
on
the
contrary
it
was
open
and
pleasing
no
doubt
had
been
handsome
beforetime
and
whatever
caused
its
melancholy
expression
had
lined
and
clouded
it
it
was
this
expression
that
had
struck
me
on
first
seeing
the
man
whilst
i
was
making
these
observations
eyeing
him
all
the
while
i
discovered
that
he
was
eyeing
me
in
a
similar
manner
and
with
an
interest
apparently
equal
to
my
own
this
caused
us
to
face
round
to
each
other
when
the
stranger
drew
from
under
his
manga
a
small
beaded
cigarero
and
gracefully
holding
it
out
to
me
said
quiere
a
fumar
caballero
would
you
smoke
sir
thank
you
yes
i
replied
in
spanish
at
the
same
time
taking
a
cigar
from
the
case
we
had
hardly
lit
our
cigarettes
when
the
man
again
turned
to
me
with
the
unexpected
question
will
you
sell
your
horse
no
not
for
a
good
price
not
for
any
price
i
would
give
five
hundred
dollars
for
him
i
would
not
part
with
him
for
twice
the
amount
i
will
give
twice
the
amount
i
have
become
attached
to
him
money
is
no
object
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
i
have
travelled
two
hundred
miles
to
buy
that
horse
i
looked
at
my
new
acquaintance
with
astonishment
involuntarily
repeating
his
last
words
you
must
have
followed
us
from
the
arkansas
then
no
i
came
from
the
rio
abajo
the
rio
abajo
you
mean
from
down
the
del
norte
yes
then
my
dear
sir
it
is
a
mistake
you
think
you
are
talking
to
somebody
else
and
bidding
for
some
other
horse
oh
no
he
is
yours
a
black
stallion
with
red
nose
and
long
full
tail
arabian
there
is
a
small
mark
over
the
left
eye
this
was
certainly
the
description
of
moro
and
i
began
to
feel
a
sort
of
superstitious
awe
in
regard
to
my
mysterious
neighbour
true
replied
i
that
is
all
correct
but
i
bought
that
stallion
many
months
ago
from
a
louisiana
planter
if
you
have
just
arrived
from
two
hundred
miles
down
the
rio
grande
how
may
i
ask
could
you
have
known
anything
about
me
or
my
horse
dispensadme
caballero
i
did
not
mean
that
i
came
from
below
to
meet
the
caravan
for
the
purpose
of
buying
an
american
horse
yours
is
the
only
one
in
the
caballada
i
would
buy
and
it
seems
the
only
one
that
is
not
for
sale
i
am
sorry
for
that
but
i
have
tested
the
qualities
of
this
animal
we
have
become
friends
no
common
motive
would
induce
me
to
part
with
him
ah
senor
it
is
not
a
common
motive
that
makes
me
so
eager
to
purchase
him
if
you
knew
that
perhaps
he
hesitated
a
moment
but
no
no
no
and
after
muttering
some
words
among
which
i
could
recognise
the
buenos
noches
caballero
the
stranger
rose
up
with
the
same
mysterious
air
that
had
all
along
characterised
him
and
left
me
i
could
hear
the
tinkling
of
the
small
bells
upon
the
rowels
of
his
spurs
as
he
slowly
warped
himself
through
the
gay
crowd
and
disappeared
into
the
night
the
vacated
seat
was
soon
occupied
by
a
dusky
manola
whose
bright
nagua
embroidered
chemisette
brown
ankles
and
small
blue
slippers
drew
my
attention
this
was
all
i
could
see
of
her
except
the
occasional
flash
of
a
very
black
eye
through
the
loophole
of
the
rebozo
tapado
by
degrees
the
rebozo
became
more
generous
the
loophole
expanded
and
the
outlines
of
a
very
pretty
and
very
malicious
little
face
were
displayed
before
me
the
end
of
the
scarf
was
adroitly
removed
from
the
left
shoulder
and
a
nude
plump
arm
ending
in
a
bunch
of
small
jewelled
fingers
hung
carelessly
down
i
am
tolerably
bashful
but
at
the
sight
of
this
tempting
partner
i
could
hold
in
no
longer
and
bending
towards
her
i
said
in
my
best
spanish
do
me
the
favour
miss
to
waltz
with
me
the
wicked
little
manola
first
held
down
her
head
and
blushed
then
raising
the
long
fringes
of
her
eyes
looked
up
again
and
wits
a
voice
as
sweet
as
that
of
a
replied
con
gusto
senor
with
pleasure
sir
nos
vamos
cried
i
elated
with
my
triumph
and
pairing
off
with
my
brilliant
partner
we
were
soon
whirling
about
in
the
mazy
we
returned
to
our
seats
again
and
after
refreshing
with
a
glass
of
albuquerque
a
and
a
husk
cigarette
again
took
the
floor
this
pleasurable
programme
we
repeated
some
times
only
varying
the
dance
from
waltz
to
polka
for
my
manola
danced
the
polka
as
if
she
had
been
a
born
bohemian
on
one
of
my
fingers
was
a
diamond
which
my
partner
seemed
to
think
was
as
her
igneous
eyes
softened
my
heart
and
the
champagne
was
producing
a
similar
effect
upon
my
head
i
began
to
speculate
on
the
propriety
of
transferring
the
diamond
from
the
smallest
of
my
fingers
to
the
largest
of
hers
which
it
would
no
doubt
have
fitted
exactly
all
at
once
i
became
conscious
of
being
under
the
surveillance
of
a
large
and
very
lepero
a
regular
pelado
who
followed
us
with
his
eyes
and
sometimes
to
every
part
of
the
room
the
expression
of
his
swarth
face
was
a
mixture
of
jealousy
and
vengeance
which
my
partner
noticed
but
as
i
thought
took
no
pains
to
soften
down
who
is
he
i
whispered
as
the
man
swung
past
us
in
his
chequered
serape
esta
mi
marido
senor
it
is
my
husband
sir
was
the
cool
reply
i
pushed
the
ring
close
up
to
the
root
of
my
finger
shutting
my
hand
upon
it
tight
as
a
vice
vamos
a
tomar
otra
copita
let
us
take
another
glass
of
wine
said
i
resolving
to
bid
my
pretty
poblana
as
soon
as
possible
a
the
taos
whisky
had
by
this
time
produced
its
effect
upon
the
dancers
the
trappers
and
teamsters
had
become
noisy
and
riotous
the
leperos
who
now
the
room
stimulated
by
wine
jealousy
old
hatreds
and
the
dance
began
to
look
more
savage
and
sulky
the
fringed
and
brown
homespun
frocks
found
favour
with
the
majas
of
mexico
partly
out
of
a
respect
for
and
a
fear
of
courage
which
is
often
at
the
bottom
of
a
love
like
theirs
although
the
trading
caravans
supplied
almost
all
the
commerce
of
santa
fe
and
it
was
clearly
the
interest
of
its
inhabitants
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
traders
the
two
races
and
hated
each
other
thoroughly
and
that
hate
was
now
displaying
itself
on
one
side
in
bullying
contempt
on
the
other
in
muttered
and
fierce
looks
of
vengeance
i
was
still
chatting
with
my
lively
partner
we
were
seated
on
the
banquette
where
i
had
introduced
myself
on
looking
casually
up
a
bright
object
met
my
eyes
it
appeared
to
be
a
naked
knife
in
the
hands
of
who
was
just
then
lowering
over
us
like
the
shadow
of
an
evil
spirit
i
was
favoured
with
only
a
slight
glimpse
of
this
dangerous
meteor
and
had
made
up
my
mind
to
steel
when
someone
plucked
me
by
the
sleeve
and
turning
i
beheld
my
quondam
acquaintance
of
the
purple
magna
dispensadme
senor
said
he
nodding
graciously
i
have
just
learned
that
the
caravan
is
going
on
to
chihuahua
true
there
is
no
market
here
for
our
goods
you
go
on
then
of
course
certainly
i
must
will
you
return
this
way
senor
it
is
very
likely
i
have
no
other
intention
at
present
perhaps
then
you
might
be
willing
to
part
with
your
horse
you
will
find
many
as
good
in
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
neither
is
likely
but
senor
should
you
be
inclined
to
do
so
will
you
promise
me
the
refusal
of
him
oh
that
i
will
promise
you
with
all
my
heart
our
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
a
huge
gaunt
missourian
who
tramping
rudely
upon
the
stranger
toes
vociferated
ye
up
old
greaser
gi
mi
a
char
y
porque
and
why
demanded
the
mexican
drawing
in
his
feet
and
looking
up
with
astonished
indignation
i
tired
jumpin
i
want
a
seat
that
it
old
hoss
there
was
something
so
bullying
and
brutal
in
the
conduct
of
this
man
that
i
felt
called
upon
to
interfere
come
said
i
addressing
him
you
have
no
right
to
deprive
this
gentleman
of
his
seat
much
less
in
such
a
fashion
eh
mister
who
asked
you
to
open
yer
head
ye
up
i
say
and
at
the
word
he
seized
the
mexican
by
the
corner
of
his
manga
as
if
to
drag
him
from
his
seat
before
i
had
time
to
reply
to
this
rude
speech
and
gesture
the
stranger
leaped
to
his
feet
and
with
a
blow
felled
the
bully
upon
the
floor
this
seemed
to
act
as
a
signal
for
bringing
several
other
quarrels
to
a
climax
there
was
a
rush
through
all
parts
of
the
sala
drunken
shouts
mingled
with
yells
of
vengeance
knives
glanced
from
their
sheaths
women
screamed
pistols
flashed
and
cracked
filling
the
rooms
with
smoke
and
dust
the
lights
went
out
fierce
struggles
could
be
heard
in
the
darkness
the
fall
of
heavy
bodies
amidst
groans
and
curses
and
for
five
minutes
these
were
the
only
sounds
having
no
cause
to
be
particularly
with
anybody
i
stood
where
i
had
risen
without
using
either
knife
or
pistol
my
frightened
all
the
while
holding
me
by
the
hand
a
painful
sensation
near
my
left
shoulder
caused
me
suddenly
to
drop
my
partner
and
with
that
unaccountable
weakness
consequent
upon
the
reception
of
a
wound
i
felt
myself
staggering
towards
the
banquette
here
i
dropped
into
a
sitting
posture
and
remained
till
the
struggle
was
over
conscious
all
the
while
that
a
stream
of
blood
was
oozing
down
my
back
and
saturating
my
undergarments
i
sat
thus
till
the
struggle
had
ended
a
light
was
brought
and
i
could
distinguish
a
number
of
men
in
moving
with
violent
gesticulations
some
of
them
were
advocating
the
justice
of
the
spree
as
they
termed
it
while
others
the
more
respectable
of
the
traders
were
denouncing
it
the
leperos
with
the
women
had
all
disappeared
and
i
could
perceive
that
the
americanos
had
carried
the
day
several
dark
objects
lay
along
the
floor
they
were
bodies
of
men
dead
or
dying
one
was
an
american
the
missourian
who
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
the
fracas
the
others
were
pelodos
i
could
see
nothing
of
my
late
acquaintance
my
fandanguera
too
su
had
disappeared
and
on
glancing
at
my
left
hand
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
so
also
had
my
diamond
ring
saint
vrain
saint
vrain
i
called
seeing
the
figure
of
my
friend
enter
at
the
door
where
are
you
old
boy
how
is
it
with
you
all
right
eh
not
quite
i
tear
good
heavens
what
this
why
you
stabbed
in
the
hump
ribs
not
bad
i
hope
off
with
your
shirt
and
let
see
first
let
us
to
my
room
come
then
my
dear
boy
lean
on
me
so
so
the
fandango
was
over
chapter
eight
seguin
the
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
wounded
in
the
field
of
battle
i
say
pleasure
under
certain
circumstances
wounds
are
luxuries
how
different
were
the
feelings
i
experienced
while
smarting
under
wounds
that
came
by
the
steel
of
the
assassin
my
earliest
anxiety
was
about
the
depth
of
my
wound
was
it
mortal
this
is
generally
the
first
question
a
man
puts
to
himself
after
discovering
that
he
has
been
shot
or
stabbed
a
wounded
man
can
not
always
answer
it
either
one
may
be
spurting
from
an
artery
at
each
palpitation
while
the
actual
pain
felt
is
not
worth
the
pricking
of
a
pin
on
reaching
the
fonda
i
sank
exhausted
on
my
bed
saint
vrain
split
my
from
cape
to
skirt
and
commenced
examining
my
wound
i
could
not
see
my
friend
face
as
he
stood
behind
me
and
i
waited
with
impatience
is
it
deep
i
asked
not
deep
as
a
nor
wide
as
a
was
the
reply
you
quite
safe
old
fellow
thank
god
and
not
the
man
who
handled
that
knife
for
the
fellow
plainly
intended
to
do
for
you
it
is
the
cut
of
a
spanish
knife
and
a
devilish
gash
it
is
haller
it
was
a
close
shave
one
inch
more
and
the
spine
my
boy
but
you
safe
i
say
here
gode
that
sponge
sacre
muttered
gode
with
true
gallic
aspirate
as
he
handed
the
wet
rag
i
felt
the
cold
application
then
a
bunch
of
soft
raw
cotton
the
best
dressing
it
could
have
was
laid
over
the
wound
and
fastened
by
strips
the
most
skilful
surgeon
could
have
done
no
more
close
as
a
clamp
added
saint
vrain
as
he
fastened
the
last
pin
and
placed
me
in
the
easiest
position
but
what
started
the
row
and
how
came
you
to
cut
such
a
figure
in
it
i
was
out
thank
god
did
you
observe
a
man
what
with
the
purple
manga
yes
he
sat
beside
us
yes
ha
no
wonder
you
say
a
man
stranger
than
he
looks
too
i
saw
him
i
know
him
and
perhaps
not
another
in
the
room
could
say
that
ay
there
was
another
continued
saint
vrain
with
a
peculiar
smile
but
what
could
have
brought
him
there
is
that
which
puzzles
me
armijo
could
not
have
seen
him
but
go
on
i
related
to
saint
vrain
the
whole
of
my
conversation
with
the
stranger
and
the
incidents
that
led
to
the
breaking
up
of
the
fandango
it
is
odd
very
odd
what
could
he
want
with
your
horse
two
hundred
miles
and
offers
a
thousand
dollars
capitaine
gode
had
called
me
captain
ever
since
the
ride
upon
the
buffalo
if
monsieur
come
two
hunred
mile
and
vill
pay
un

thousan

he
moro

ver
moch
un
grand
passion
pour
le
cheval
pourquoi
vy
he
no
like
him
ver
sheep
vy
he

i
started
at
the
suggestion
and
looked
towards
saint
vrain
vith
permiss
of
le
capitaine
i
vill
le
cheval
cache
continued
the
canadian
moving
towards
the
door
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
old
as
far
as
that
gentleman
is
concerned
he
not
steal
your
horse
though
that
no
reason
why
you
should
not
fulfil
your
intention
and
the
animal
there
are
thieves
enough
in
santa
fe
to
steal
the
horses
of
a
whole
regiment
you
had
better
fasten
him
by
the
door
here
gode
passed
to
the
door
and
disappeared
who
is
he
i
asked
this
man
about
whom
there
seems
to
be
so
much
that
is
mysterious
ah
if
you
knew
i
will
tell
you
some
queer
passages
by
and
by
but
not
you
have
no
need
of
excitement
that
is
the
famous
seguin
the
the
ay
you
have
heard
of
him
no
doubt
at
least
you
would
had
you
been
much
among
the
mountains
i
have
the
ruffian
the
wholesale
butcher
of
innocent
a
dark
waif
danced
against
the
wall
it
was
the
shadow
of
a
man
i
looked
up
seguin
was
before
me
saint
vrain
on
seeing
him
enter
had
turned
away
and
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
i
was
on
the
point
of
changing
my
tirade
into
the
apostrophic
form
and
at
the
same
time
ordering
the
man
out
of
my
sight
when
something
in
his
look
influenced
me
to
remain
silent
i
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
heard
or
understood
to
whom
my
abusive
epithets
had
been
applied
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
that
betrayed
his
having
done
so
i
observed
only
the
same
look
that
had
at
first
attracted
me
the
same
expression
of
deep
melancholy
could
this
man
be
the
hardened
and
heartless
villain
i
had
heard
of
the
author
of
so
many
atrocities
sir
said
he
seeing
that
i
remained
silent
i
deeply
regret
what
has
happened
to
you
i
was
the
involuntary
cause
of
your
mishap
is
your
wound
a
severe
one
it
is
not
i
replied
with
a
dryness
of
manner
that
seemed
somewhat
to
disconcert
him
i
am
glad
of
that
he
continued
after
a
pause
i
came
to
thank
you
for
your
generous
interference
i
leave
santa
fe
in
ten
minutes
i
must
bid
you
farewell
he
held
forth
his
hand
i
muttered
the
word
farewell
but
without
offering
to
exchange
the
salutation
the
stories
of
cruel
atrocity
connected
with
the
name
of
this
man
came
into
my
mind
at
the
moment
and
i
felt
a
loathing
for
him
his
arm
remained
in
its
outstretched
position
while
a
strange
expression
began
to
steal
over
his
countenance
as
he
saw
that
i
hesitated
i
can
not
take
your
hand
i
said
at
length
and
why
he
asked
in
a
mild
tone
why
it
is
red
red
away
sir
away
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
me
with
a
sorrowful
look
there
was
not
a
spark
of
anger
in
them
he
drew
his
hand
within
the
folds
of
his
manga
and
uttering
a
deep
sigh
turned
and
walked
slowly
out
of
the
room
saint
vrain
who
had
wheeled
round
at
the
close
of
this
scene
strode
forward
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
after
him
i
could
see
the
mexican
from
where
i
lay
as
he
crossed
the
quadrangular
patio
he
had
shrugged
himself
closely
in
his
manga
and
was
moving
off
in
an
attitude
that
betokened
the
deepest
dejection
in
a
moment
he
was
out
of
sight
having
passed
through
the
saguan
and
into
the
street
there
is
something
truly
mysterious
about
that
man
tell
me
saint
vrain
look
yonder
interrupted
my
friend
pointing
through
the
open
door
i
looked
out
into
the
moonlight
three
human
forms
were
moving
along
the
wall
towards
the
entrance
of
the
patio
their
height
their
peculiar
attitudes
and
the
stealthy
silence
of
their
steps
convinced
me
they
were
indians
the
next
moment
they
were
lost
under
the
dark
shadows
of
the
saguan
who
are
they
i
inquired
worse
enemies
to
poor
seguin
than
you
would
be
if
you
knew
him
better
i
pity
him
if
these
hungry
hawks
overtake
him
in
the
dark
but
no
he
worth
warning
and
a
hand
to
help
him
if
need
be
he
shall
have
it
keep
cool
harry
i
will
be
back
in
a
jiffy
so
saying
saint
vrain
left
me
and
the
moment
after
i
could
see
his
light
form
passing
hastily
out
of
the
gate
i
lay
reflecting
on
the
strangeness
of
the
incidents
that
seemed
to
be
occurring
around
me
i
was
not
without
some
painful
reflections
i
had
wounded
the
feelings
of
one
who
had
not
injured
me
and
for
whom
my
friend
evidently
entertained
a
high
respect
a
shod
hoof
sounded
upon
the
stones
outside
it
was
gode
with
my
horse
and
the
next
moment
i
heard
him
hammering
the
into
the
pavement
shortly
after
saint
vrain
himself
returned
well
i
inquired
what
happened
you
nothing
much
that
a
weasel
that
never
sleeps
he
had
mounted
his
horse
before
they
came
up
with
him
and
was
very
soon
out
of
their
reach
but
may
they
not
follow
him
on
horseback
that
is
not
likely
he
has
comrades
not
far
from
here
i
warrant
you
armijo
and
it
was
he
sent
those
villains
on
his
track
has
no
force
that
dare
follow
him
when
he
gets
upon
the
wild
hills
no
fear
for
him
once
he
has
cleared
the
houses
but
my
dear
saint
vrain
tell
me
what
you
know
of
this
singular
man
i
am
wound
up
to
a
pitch
of
curiosity
not
harry
not
i
do
not
wish
to
cause
you
further
excitement
besides
i
have
reason
to
leave
you
now
then
and
so
saying
my
mercurial
friend
left
me
to
gode
and
a
night
of
restlessness
chapter
nine
left
behind
on
the
third
day
after
the
fandango
it
is
announced
that
the
caravan
will
move
onward
to
chihuahua
the
day
arrives
and
i
am
unable
to
travel
with
it
my
surgeon
a
wretched
leech
of
a
mexican
assures
me
that
it
will
be
certain
death
to
attempt
the
journey
for
want
of
any
opposing
evidence
i
am
constrained
to
believe
him
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
adopt
the
joyless
resolve
to
remain
in
santa
fe
until
the
return
of
the
traders
chafing
on
a
feverish
bed
i
take
leave
of
my
late
companions
we
part
with
many
regrets
but
above
all
i
am
pained
at
bidding
adieu
to
saint
vrain
whose
companionship
has
been
my
solace
through
three
days
of
suffering
he
has
proved
my
friend
and
has
undertaken
to
take
charge
of
my
waggons
and
dispose
of
my
goods
in
the
market
of
chihuahua
do
not
fret
man
says
he
taking
leave
kill
time
with
the
champagne
of
el
paso
we
will
be
back
in
a
squirrel
jump
and
trust
me
i
will
bring
you
a
of
mexican
shiners
god
bless
you
i
can
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
from
the
open
window
see
the
white
tilts
of
the
waggons
as
the
train
rolls
over
a
neighbouring
hill
i
hear
the
cracking
whips
and
the
of
the
teamsters
i
see
the
traders
mount
and
gallop
after
and
i
turn
upon
my
couch
with
a
feeling
of
loneliness
and
desertion
for
days
i
lay
tossing
and
fretting
despite
the
consolatory
influence
of
the
champagne
and
the
rude
but
kindly
attentions
of
my
voyageur
valet
i
rise
at
length
dress
myself
and
sit
in
my
ventana
i
have
a
good
view
of
the
plaza
and
the
adjacent
streets
with
their
rows
of
brown
adobe
houses
and
dusty
ways
between
i
gaze
hour
after
hour
on
what
is
passing
without
the
scene
is
not
without
novelty
as
well
as
variety
swarthy
faces
appear
behind
the
folds
of
dingy
rebozos
fierce
glances
lower
under
the
slouch
of
broad
sombreros
poplanas
with
short
skirts
and
slippered
feet
pass
my
window
and
groups
of
tame
indians
pueblos
crowd
in
from
the
neighbouring
rancherias
belabouring
their
donkeys
as
they
go
these
bring
baskets
of
fruit
and
vegetables
they
squat
down
upon
the
dusty
plaza
behind
piles
of
prickly
pears
or
pyramids
of
tomatoes
and
chile
the
women
hucksters
laugh
and
sing
and
chatter
continuously
the
tortillera
kneeling
by
her
metate
bruises
the
boiled
maize
claps
it
into
thin
flakes
flings
it
on
the
heated
stone
and
then
cries
tortillas
tortillas
calientes
the
cocinera
stirs
the
peppery
stew
of
chile
colorado
lifts
the
red
liquid
in
her
wooden
ladle
and
invites
her
customers
by
the
expressions
chile
bueno
excellente
carbon
carbon
cries
the
agua
agua

shouts
the
aguadord
pan
fino
pan
bianco
screams
the
baker
and
other
cries
from
the
vendors
of
atole
huevos
and
leche
are
uttered
in
shrill
discordant
voices
such
are
the
voices
of
a
mexican
plaza
they
are
at
first
interesting
they
become
monotonous
then
disagreeable
until
at
length
i
am
tortured
and
listen
to
them
with
a
feverish
excitement
after
a
few
days
i
am
able
to
walk
and
go
out
with
my
faithful
gode
we
stroll
through
the
town
it
reminds
me
of
an
extensive
before
the
kilns
have
been
set
on
fire
we
encounter
the
same
brown
adobes
everywhere
the
same
leperos
lounging
at
the
corners
the
same
slippered
wenches
the
same
strings
of
belaboured
donkeys
the
same
shrill
and
detestable
cries
we
pass
by
a
house
in
a
remote
quarter
our
ears
are
saluted
by
voices
from
within
we
hear
shouts
of
mueran
los
yankies
abajo
los
americanos
no
doubt
the
pelado
to
whom
i
was
indebted
for
my
wound
is
among
the
ruffians
who
crowd
into
the
windows
but
i
know
the
lawlessness
of
the
place
too
well
to
apply
for
justice
we
hear
the
same
shouts
in
another
street
again
in
the
plaza
and
gode
and
i
the
fonda
with
a
conviction
that
our
appearance
in
public
might
be
attended
with
danger
we
resolve
therefore
to
keep
within
doors
in
all
my
life
i
never
suffered
ennui
as
when
cooped
up
in
this
town
and
almost
confined
within
the
walls
of
its
filthy
fonda
i
felt
it
the
more
that
i
had
so
lately
enjoyed
the
company
of
such
free
jovial
spirits
and
i
could
fancy
them
in
their
bivouacs
on
the
banks
of
the
del
norte
carousing
laughing
or
listening
to
some
wild
mountain
story
gode
shared
my
feelings
and
became
as
desponding
as
myself
the
light
humour
of
the
voyageur
disappeared
the
song
of
the
canadian
boatman
was
heard
no
longer
but
in
its
place
the
sacre
and
english
exclamations
were
spluttered
plentifully
and
hurled
at
everything
mexican
i
resolved
at
length
to
put
an
end
to
our
sufferings
this
life
will
never
do
gode
said
i
addressing
my
compagnon

there

and
the
canadian
ran
from
the
room
snapping
his
fingers
with
delight
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
santa
fe
at
any
rate
should
my
strength
yet
but
half
restored
hold
out
i
would
follow
and
if
possible
overtake
the
caravan
i
knew
it
could
make
but
short
journeys
over
the
deep
sand
roads
of
the
del
norte
should
i
not
succeed
in
coming
up
with
it
i
could
halt
in
albuquerque
or
el
paso
either
of
which
would
offer
me
a
residence
at
least
as
agreeable
as
the
one
i
was
leaving
my
surgeon
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
setting
out
he
represented
that
i
was
in
a
most
critical
condition
my
wound
far
from
being
cicatrised
he
set
forth
in
most
eloquent
terms
the
dangers
of
fever
of
gangrene
of
haemorrhage
he
saw
i
was
obstinate
and
concluded
his
monitions
by
presenting
his
bill
it
amounted
to
the
modest
sum
of
one
hundred
dollars
it
was
an
extortion
what
could
i
do
i
stormed
and
protested
the
mexican
threatened
me
with
governor
justice
gode
swore
in
french
spanish
english
and
indian
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
i
saw
that
the
bill
would
have
to
be
paid
and
i
paid
it
though
with
indifferent
grace
the
leech
disappeared
and
the
landlord
came
next
he
like
the
former
made
earnest
entreaty
to
prevent
me
from
setting
forth
he
offered
a
variety
of
reasons
to
detain
me
do
not
go
for
your
life
senor
do
not
and
why
good
jose
i
inquired
oh

but
i

when
they
were

and
the

oh
senor
they
are
all
gone
they
were
carried
to
the
mountains
by
the
savages
pobres
mugeres
it
is
a
sad
story
truly
but
the
indians
i
understand
only
make
these
forays
at
long
intervals
i
am
not
likely
to
meet
with
them
now
at
all
events
jose
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
run
the
risk
but
senor
continued
jose
lowering
his
voice
to
a
confidential
tone
there
are
other
ladrones
besides
the
indians
white
ones
muchos

white

carrai
and
jose
closed
his
fingers
as
if
clutching
some
imaginary
object
this
appeal
to
my
fears
was
in
vain
i
answered
it
by
pointing
to
my
revolvers
and
rifle
and
to
the
belt
of
my
henchman
gode
when
the
mexican
boniface
saw
that
i
was
determined
to
rob
him
of
all
the
guests
he
had
in
his
house
he
retired
sullenly
and
shortly
after
returned
with
his
bill
like
that
of
the
medico
it
was
out
of
all
proportion
but
i
could
not
help
myself
and
paid
it
by
grey
dawn
i
was
in
my
saddle
and
followed
by
gode
and
a
couple
of
heavily
packed
mules
i
rode
out
of
the
town
and
took
the
road
for
the
rio
abajo
chapter
ten
the
del
norte
for
days
we
journey
down
the
del
norte
we
pass
through
numerous
villages
many
of
them
types
of
santa
fe
we
cross
the
zequias
and
irrigating
canals
and
pass
along
fields
of
bright
green
maize
plants
we
see
vineyards
and
grand
haciendas
these
appear
richer
and
more
prosperous
as
we
approach
the
southern
part
of
the
province
the
rio
abajo
in
the
distance
both
east
and
west
we
descry
dark
mountains
rolled
up
against
the
sky
these
are
the
twin
ranges
of
the
rocky
mountains
long
spurs
trend
towards
the
river
and
in
places
appear
to
close
up
the
valley
they
add
to
the
expression
of
many
a
beautiful
landscape
that
opens
before
us
as
we
move
onward
we
see
picturesque
costumes
in
the
villages
and
along
the
highways
men
dressed
in
the
chequered
serape
or
the
striped
blankets
of
the
navajoes
conical
sombreros
with
broad
brims
calzoneros
of
velveteen
with
their
rows
of
shining
castletops
and
fastened
at
the
waist
by
the
jaunty
sash
we
see
mangas
and
tilmas
and
men
wearing
the
sandal
as
in
eastern
lands
on
the
women
we
observe
the
graceful
rebozo
the
short
nagua
and
the
embroidered
chemisette
we
see
rude
implements
of
husbandry
the
creaking
carreta
with
its
block
wheels
the
primitive
plough
of
the
forking
scarcely
scoring
the
soil
the
oxen
the
goad
the
clumsy
hoe
in
the
hands
of
the
peon
serf
these
are
all
objects
that
are
new
and
curious
to
our
eyes
and
that
indicate
the
lowest
order
of
agricultural
knowledge
along
the
roads
we
meet
numerous
atajos
in
charge
of
their
arrieros
we
observe
the
mules
small
smooth
and
vicious
we
glance
at
the
heavy
alparejas
and
bright
worsted
apishamores
we
notice
the
tight
wiry
mustangs
ridden
by
the
arrieros
the
saddles
and
hair
bridles
the
swarth
faces
and
pointed
beards
of
the
riders
the
huge
spurs
that
tinkle
at
every
step
the
exclamations
hola
mula
malraya
vaya
we
notice
all
these
and
they
tell
us
we
are
journeying
in
the
land
of
the
under
other
circumstances
these
objects
would
have
interested
me
at
that
time
they
appeared
to
me
like
the
pictures
of
a
panorama
or
the
changing
scenes
of
a
continuous
dream
as
such
have
they
left
their
impressions
on
my
memory
i
was
under
the
incipient
delirium
of
fever
it
was
as
yet
only
incipient
nevertheless
it
distorted
the
images
around
me
and
rendered
their
impressions
unnatural
and
wearisome
my
wound
began
to
pain
me
afresh
and
the
hot
sun
and
the
dust
and
the
thirst
with
the
miserable
accommodations
of
new
mexican
posadas
vexed
me
to
an
excess
of
endurance
on
the
fifth
day
after
leaving
santa
fe
we
entered
the
wretched
little
pueblo
of
parida
it
was
my
intention
to
have
remained
there
all
night
but
it
proved
a
ruffian
sort
of
place
with
meagre
chances
of
comfort
and
i
moved
on
to
socorro
this
is
the
last
inhabited
spot
in
new
mexico
as
you
approach
the
terrible
desert
the
jornada
del
muerte
gode
had
never
made
the
journey
and
at
parida
i
had
obtained
one
thing
that
we
stood
in
need
of
a
guide
he
had
volunteered
and
as
i
learnt
that
it
would
be
no
easy
task
to
procure
one
at
socorro
i
was
fain
to
take
him
along
he
was
a
coarse
customer
and
i
did
not
at
all
like
his
appearance
but
i
found
on
reaching
socorro
that
what
i
had
heard
was
correct
no
guide
could
be
hired
on
any
terms
so
great
was
their
dread
of
the
jornada
and
its
occasional
denizens
the
apaches
socorro
was
alive
with
indian
rumours
novedades
the
indians
had
fallen
upon
an
atajo
near
the
crossing
of
fra
cristobal
and
murdered
the
arrieros
to
a
man
the
village
was
full
of
consternation
at
the
news
the
people
dreaded
an
attack
and
thought
me
mad
when
i
made
known
my
intention
of
crossing
the
jornada
i
began
to
fear
they
would
frighten
my
guide
from
his
engagement
but
the
fellow
stood
out
staunchly
still
expressing
his
willingness
to
accompany
us
without
the
prospect
of
meeting
the
apache
savages
i
was
but
ill
prepared
for
the
jornada
the
pain
of
my
wound
had
increased
and
i
was
fatigued
and
burning
with
fever
but
the
caravan
had
passed
through
socorro
only
three
days
before
and
i
was
in
hopes
of
overtaking
my
old
companions
before
they
could
leave
el
paso
this
determined
me
to
proceed
in
the
morning
and
i
made
arrangements
for
an
early
start
gode
and
i
were
awake
before
dawn
my
attendant
went
out
to
summon
the
guide
and
saddle
our
animals
i
remained
in
the
house
making
preparations
for
a
cup
of
coffee
before
starting
i
was
assisted
by
the
landlord
of
the
posada
who
had
risen
and
was
stalking
about
in
his
serape
while
thus
engaged
i
was
startled
by
the
voice
of
gode
calling
from
without
von
maitre
von
maitre
the
rascal
have
him
run
vay
what
do
you
mean
who
has
run
away
oh
monsieur
la
mexicaine
with
von
mule
has
robb
and
run
vay
allons
monsieur
allons
i
followed
the
canadian
to
the
stable
with
a
feeling
of
anxiety
my
horse
but
no
thank
heaven
he
was
there
one
of
the
mules
the
macho
was
gone
it
was
the
one
which
the
guide
had
ridden
from
parida
perhaps
he
is
not
off
yet
i
suggested
he
may
still
be
in
the
town
we
sent
and
went
in
all
directions
to
find
him
but
to
no
purpose
we
were
relieved
at
length
from
all
doubts
by
the
arrival
of
some
early
market
men
who
had
met
such
a
man
as
our
guide
far
up
the
river
and
riding
a
mule
at
full
gallop
what
should
we
do
follow
him
to
parida
no
that
would
be
a
journey
for
nothing
i
knew
that
he
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
go
that
way
even
if
he
did
it
would
have
been
a
fool
errand
to
seek
for
justice
there
so
i
determined
on
leaving
it
over
until
the
return
of
the
traders
would
enable
me
to
find
the
thief
and
demand
his
punishment
from
the
authorities
my
regrets
at
the
loss
of
my
macho
were
not
unmixed
with
a
sort
of
gratitude
to
the
fellow
when
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
nose
of
my
whimpering
charger
what
hindered
him
from
taking
the
horse
instead
of
the
mule
it
is
a
question
i
have
never
been
able
to
answer
to
this
day
i
can
only
account
for
the
fellow
preference
for
the
mule
on
the
score
of
downright
honesty
or
the
most
perverse
stupidity
i
made
overtures
for
another
guide
i
applied
to
the
boniface
of
socorro
but
without
success
he
knew
no
mozo
who
would
undertake
the
journey
los
apaches
los
apaches
i
appealed
to
the
peons
and
loiterers
of
the
plaza
los
apaches
wherever
i
went
i
was
answered
with
los
apaches
and
a
shake
of
the
forefinger
in
front
of
the
nose
a
negative
sign
over
all
mexico
it
is
plain
gode
we
can
get
no
guide
we
must
try
this
jornada
without
one
what
say
you
voyageur
i
am
agree
mon
maitre
allons
and
followed
by
my
faithful
compagnon
with
our
remaining
i
took
the
road
that
leads
to
the
desert
that
night
we
slept
among
the
ruins
of
valverde
and
the
next
morning
after
an
early
start
embarked
upon
the
journey
of
death
chapter
eleven
the
journey
of
death
in
two
hours
we
reached
the
crossing
at
fra
cristobal
here
the
road
parts
from
the
river
and
strikes
into
the
waterless
desert
we
plunge
through
the
shallow
ford
coming
out
on
the
eastern
bank
we
fill
our
xuages
with
care
and
give
our
animals
as
much
as
they
will
drink
after
a
short
halt
to
refresh
ourselves
we
ride
onward
we
have
not
travelled
far
before
we
recognise
the
appropriate
name
of
this
terrible
journey
scattered
along
the
path
we
see
the
bones
of
many
animals
there
are
human
bones
too
that
white
spheroidal
mass
with
its
grinning
rows
and
serrated
sutures
that
is
a
human
skull
it
lies
beside
the
skeleton
of
a
horse
horse
and
rider
have
fallen
together
the
wolves
have
stripped
them
at
the
same
time
they
have
dropped
down
on
their
thirsty
track
and
perished
in
despair
although
water
had
they
known
it
was
within
reach
of
another
effort
we
see
the
skeleton
of
a
mule
with
the
alpareja
still
buckled
around
it
and
an
old
blanket
flapped
and
tossed
by
many
a
whistling
wind
other
objects
that
have
been
brought
there
by
human
aid
strike
the
eye
as
we
proceed
a
bruised
canteen
the
fragments
of
a
glass
bottle
an
old
hat
a
piece
of
a
stirrup
red
with
rust
a
broken
strap
with
many
like
symbols
are
strewn
along
our
path
speaking
a
melancholy
language
we
are
still
only
on
the
border
of
the
desert
we
are
fresh
how
when
we
have
travelled
over
and
neared
the
opposite
side
shall
we
leave
such
souvenirs
we
are
filled
with
painful
forebodings
as
we
look
across
the
arid
waste
that
stretches
indefinitely
before
us
we
do
not
dread
the
apache
nature
herself
is
the
enemy
we
fear
taking
the
for
our
guide
we
creep
on
we
grow
silent
as
if
we
were
dumb
the
mountains
of
cristobal
sink
behind
us
and
we
are
almost
out
of
sight
of
land
we
can
see
the
ridges
of
the
sierra
blanca
away
to
the
eastward
but
before
us
to
the
south
the
eye
encounters
no
mark
or
limit
we
push
forward
without
guide
or
any
object
to
indicate
our
course
we
are
soon
in
the
midst
of
bewilderment
a
scene
of
seeming
enchantment
springs
up
around
us
vast
towers
of
sand
borne
up
by
the
whirlblast
rise
vertically
to
the
sky
they
move
to
and
fro
over
the
plain
they
are
yellow
and
luminous
the
sun
glistens
among
their
floating
crystals
they
move
slowly
but
they
are
approaching
us
i
behold
them
with
feelings
of
awe
i
have
heard
of
travellers
lifted
in
their
whirling
vortex
and
dashed
back
again
from
fearful
heights
the
frightened
at
the
phenomenon
breaks
the
lasso
and
scampers
away
among
the
ridges
gode
has
galloped
in
pursuit
i
am
alone
nine
or
ten
gigantic
columns
now
appear
stalking
over
the
plain
and
circling
gradually
around
me
there
is
something
unearthly
in
the
sight
they
resemble
creatures
of
a
phantom
world
they
seem
endowed
with
demon
life
two
of
them
approach
each
other
there
is
a
short
ghastly
struggle
that
ends
in
their
mutual
destruction
the
sand
is
precipitated
to
the
earth
and
the
dust
floats
off
in
dun
shapeless
masses
several
have
shut
me
within
a
space
and
are
slowly
closing
upon
me
my
dog
howls
and
barks
the
horse
cowers
with
affright
and
shivers
between
my
thighs
uttering
terrified
expressions
my
brain
reels
strange
objects
appear
the
fever
is
upon
me
the
laden
currents
clash
in
their
wild
torsion
i
am
twisted
around
and
torn
from
my
saddle
my
eyes
mouth
and
ears
are
filled
with
dust
sand
stones
and
branches
strike
me
spitefully
in
the
face
and
i
am
flung
with
violence
to
the
earth
i
lay
for
a
moment
where
i
had
fallen
and
blind
i
was
neither
stunned
nor
hurt
and
i
began
to
grope
around
me
for
as
yet
i
could
see
nothing
my
eyes
were
full
of
sand
and
pained
me
exceedingly
throwing
out
my
arms
i
felt
for
my
horse
i
called
him
by
name
a
low
whimper
answered
me
i
staggered
towards
the
spot
and
laid
my
hands
upon
him
he
was
down
upon
his
flank
i
seized
the
bridle
and
he
sprang
up
but
i
could
feel
that
he
was
shivering
like
an
aspen
i
stood
by
his
head
for
nearly
half
an
hour
rubbing
the
dust
from
my
eyes
and
waiting
until
the
simoom
might
settle
away
at
length
the
atmosphere
grew
clearer
and
i
could
see
the
sky
but
the
sand
still
drifted
along
the
ridges
and
i
could
not
distinguish
the
surface
of
the
plain
there
were
no
signs
of
gode
i
mounted
and
commenced
riding
over
the
plain
in
search
of
my
comrade
i
had
no
idea
of
what
direction
he
had
taken
i
made
a
circuit
of
a
mile
or
so
still
calling
his
name
as
i
went
i
received
no
reply
and
could
see
no
traces
upon
the
ground
i
rode
for
an
hour
galloping
from
ridge
to
ridge
but
still
without
meeting
any
signs
of
my
comrade
or
the
mules
i
pulled
up
in
despair
i
had
shouted
until
i
was
faint
and
hoarse
i
could
search
no
longer
i
was
thirsty
and
would
drink
o
god
my
xuages
are
broken
the
has
carried
off
the
the
crushed
calabash
still
hung
upon
its
thong
but
the
last
drops
it
had
contained
were
trickling
down
the
flanks
of
my
horse
i
knew
that
i
might
be
fifty
miles
from
water
you
can
not
understand
the
fearfulness
of
this
situation
you
live
in
a
northern
zone
in
a
land
of
pools
and
streams
and
limpid
springs
how
unlike
the
denizen
of
the
desert
the
voyageur
of
the
prairie
sea
water
is
his
chief
care
his
solicitude
water
the
divinity
he
worships
without
water
even
in
the
midst
of
plenty
plenty
of
food
he
must
die
in
the
wild
western
desert
it
is
the
thirst
that
kills
no
wonder
i
was
filled
with
despair
i
believed
myself
to
be
about
the
middle
of
the
jornada
i
knew
that
i
could
never
reach
the
other
side
without
water
the
yearning
had
already
begun
my
throat
and
tongue
felt
shrivelled
and
parched
i
had
lost
all
knowledge
of
the
course
i
should
take
the
mountains
hitherto
my
guide
seemed
to
trend
in
every
direction
their
numerous
spurs
puzzled
me
i
remembered
hearing
of
a
spring
the
ojo
del
muerto
that
was
said
to
lie
westward
of
the
trail
sometimes
there
was
water
in
the
spring
on
other
occasions
travellers
had
reached
it
only
to
find
the
fountain
dried
up
and
leave
their
bones
upon
its
banks
so
ran
the
tales
in
socorro
i
headed
my
horse
westward
i
would
seek
the
spring
and
should
i
fail
to
find
it
push
on
to
the
river
this
was
turning
out
of
my
course
but
i
must
reach
the
water
and
save
my
life
i
sat
in
my
saddle
faint
and
choking
leaving
my
animal
to
go
at
will
i
had
lost
the
energy
to
guide
him
he
went
many
miles
westward
for
the
sun
told
me
the
course
i
was
suddenly
roused
from
my
stupor
a
glad
sight
was
before
me
a
lake
a
lake
shining
like
crystal
was
i
certain
i
saw
it
could
it
be
the
mirage
no
its
outlines
were
too
sharply
defined
it
had
not
that
filmy
whitish
appearance
which
distinguishes
the
latter
phenomenon
no
it
was
not
the
mirage
it
was
water
i
involuntarily
pressed
the
spur
against
the
side
of
my
horse
but
he
needed
not
that
he
had
already
eyed
the
water
and
sprang
forward
inspirited
with
new
energy
the
next
moment
he
was
in
it
up
to
his
flanks
i
flung
myself
from
the
saddle
with
a
plunge
i
was
about
to
lift
the
water
in
my
concave
palms
when
the
actions
of
my
horse
attracted
me
instead
of
drinking
greedily
he
stood
tossing
his
head
with
snorts
of
disappointment
my
dog
too
refused
to
lap
and
ran
along
the
shore
whining
and
howling
i
knew
what
this
meant
but
with
that
common
obstinacy
which
refuses
all
testimony
but
the
evidence
of
the
senses
i
lifted
some
drops
in
my
hand
and
applied
them
to
my
lips
they
were
briny
and
burning
i
might
have
known
this
before
reaching
the
lake
for
i
had
ridden
through
a
salt
incrustation
that
surrounded
it
like
a
belt
of
snow
but
my
brain
was
fevered
my
reason
had
left
me
it
was
of
no
use
remaining
where
i
was
i
climbed
back
into
my
saddle
and
rode
along
the
shore
over
fields
of
salt
here
and
there
my
horse
hoof
rang
against
bleaching
bones
of
animals
the
remains
of
many
a
victim
well
was
this
lake
named
the
laguna
del
muerto
the
lake
of
death
reaching
its
southern
point
i
again
headed
westward
in
hopes
of
striking
the
river
from
this
time
until
a
later
period
when
i
found
myself
in
a
far
different
scene
i
have
no
distinct
memories
i
remember
dismounting
on
a
high
bank
i
must
have
travelled
unconsciously
for
hours
before
for
the
sun
was
low
down
on
the
horizon
as
i
alighted
it
was
a
very
high
bank
a
precipice
and
below
me
i
saw
a
beautiful
river
sweeping
onward
through
groves
of
emerald
greenness
i
thought
there
were
many
birds
fluttering
in
the
groves
and
their
voices
rang
in
delicious
melody
there
was
fragrance
on
the
air
and
the
scene
below
me
seemed
an
elysium
i
thought
that
around
where
i
stood
all
was
bleak
and
barren
and
parched
with
intolerable
heat
i
was
tortured
with
a
slakeless
thirst
that
grew
fiercer
as
i
gazed
on
the
flowing
water
these
were
real
incidents
all
this
was
true
i
must
drink
i
must
to
the
river
it
is
cool
sweet
water
oh
i
must
drink
what
a
horrid
cliff
no
i
will
not
go
down
there
i
can
descend
more
easily
here
who
are
these
forms
who
are
you
sir
ah
it
is
you
my
brave
moro
and
you
alp
come
come
follow
me
down
down
to
the
river
ah
again
that
accursed
cliff
look
at
the
beautiful
water
it
smiles
it
ripples
on
on
on
let
us
drink
no
not
yet
we
can
not
yet
we
must
go
farther
ugh
such
a
height
to
leap
from
but
we
must
drink
one
and
all
come
gode
come
moro
old
friend
alp
come
on
we
shall
reach
it
we
shall
drink
who
is
tantalus
ha
ha
not
i
not
i
stand
back
fiends
do
not
push
me
over
back
back
i
say
oh
part
of
all
this
was
a
reality
part
was
a
dream
a
dream
that
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
horrors
of
a
first
intoxication
chapter
twelve
zoe
i
lay
tracing
the
figures
upon
the
curtains
they
were
scenes
of
the
olden
time
mailed
knights
helmed
and
mounted
dashing
at
each
other
with
couched
lances
or
tumbling
from
their
horses
pierced
by
the
spear
other
scenes
there
were
noble
dames
sitting
on
flemish
palfreys
and
watching
the
flight
of
the
merlin
hawk
there
were
pages
in
waiting
and
dogs
of
curious
and
extinct
breeds
held
in
the
leash
perhaps
these
never
existed
except
in
the
dreams
of
some
artist
but
my
eye
followed
their
strange
shapes
with
a
sort
of
wonder
metallic
rods
upheld
the
curtains
rods
that
shone
brightly
and
curved
upwards
forming
a
canopy
my
eyes
ran
along
these
rods
scanning
their
configuration
and
admiring
as
a
child
admires
the
regularity
of
their
curves
i
was
not
in
my
own
land
these
things
were
strange
to
me
yet
thought
i
i
have
seen
something
like
them
before
but
where
oh
this
i
know
with
its
broad
stripes
and
silken
texture
it
is
a
navajo
blanket
where
was
i
last
in
new
mexico
yes
now
i
remember
the
jornada
but
how
came
i
can
i
untwist
this
it
is
close
woven
it
is
wool
fine
wool
no
i
can
not
separate
a
thread
from
my
fingers
how
white
and
thin
they
are
and
my
nails
blue
and
long
as
the
talons
of
a
bird
i
have
a
beard
i
feel
it
on
my
chin
what
gave
me
a
beard
i
never
wear
it
i
will
shave
it
off
ha
my
moustache
i
was
wearied
and
slept
again
once
more
my
eyes
were
tracing
the
figures
upon
the
curtains
the
knights
and
dames
the
hounds
hawks
and
horses
but
my
brain
had
become
clearer
and
music
was
flowing
into
it
i
lay
silent
and
listened
the
voice
was
a
female
it
was
soft
and
finely
modulated
someone
played
upon
a
stringed
instrument
i
recognised
the
tones
of
the
spanish
harp
but
the
song
was
french
a
song
of
normandy
and
the
words
were
in
the
language
of
that
romantic
land
i
wondered
at
this
for
my
consciousness
of
late
events
was
returning
and
i
knew
that
i
was
far
from
france
the
light
was
streaming
over
my
couch
and
turning
my
face
to
the
front
i
saw
that
the
curtains
were
drawn
aside
i
was
in
a
large
room
oddly
but
elegantly
furnished
human
figures
were
before
me
seated
and
standing
after
looking
steadily
for
a
while
my
vision
became
more
distinct
and
reliable
and
i
saw
that
there
were
but
three
persons
in
the
room
a
man
and
two
females
i
remained
silent
not
certain
but
that
the
scene
before
me
was
only
some
new
phase
of
my
dream
my
eyes
wandered
from
one
of
the
living
figures
to
another
without
attracting
the
attention
of
any
of
them
they
were
all
in
different
attitudes
and
occupied
differently
nearest
me
was
a
woman
of
middle
age
seated
upon
a
low
ottoman
the
harp
i
had
heard
was
before
her
and
she
continued
to
play
she
must
have
been
i
thought
when
young
a
woman
of
extreme
beauty
she
was
still
beautiful
in
a
certain
sense
the
noble
features
were
there
though
i
could
perceive
that
they
had
been
scathed
by
more
than
ordinary
suffering
of
the
mind
she
was
a
frenchwoman
an
ethnologist
could
have
told
that
at
a
glance
those
lines
the
characteristics
of
her
highly
gifted
race
were
easily
traceable
i
thought
there
was
a
time
when
that
face
had
witched
many
a
heart
with
its
smiles
there
were
no
smiles
on
it
now
but
a
deep
yet
intellectual
expression
of
melancholy
this
i
perceived
too
in
her
voice
in
her
song
in
every
note
that
vibrated
from
the
strings
of
the
instrument
my
eye
wandered
farther
a
man
of
more
than
middle
age
stood
by
the
table
near
the
centre
of
the
room
his
face
was
turned
towards
me
and
his
nationality
was
as
easily
determined
as
that
of
the
lady
the
high
florid
cheeks
the
broad
front
the
prominent
chin
the
small
green
cap
with
its
long
peak
and
conical
crown
the
blue
spectacles
were
all
characteristics
he
was
a
german
his
occupation
was
also
characteristic
of
his
nationality
before
him
were
strewed
over
the
table
and
upon
the
floor
the
objects
of
his
study
plants
and
shrubs
of
various
species
he
was
busy
with
these
classifying
and
carefully
laying
them
out
between
the
leaves
of
his
portfolio
it
was
evident
that
the
old
man
was
a
botanist
a
glance
to
the
right
and
the
naturalist
and
his
labours
were
no
longer
regarded
i
was
looking
upon
the
loveliest
object
that
ever
came
before
my
eyes
and
my
heart
bounded
within
me
as
i
strained
forward
in
the
intensity
of
its
admiration
yet
it
was
not
a
woman
that
held
my
gaze
captive
but
a
child
a
girl
a
maid
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
womanhood
ready
to
cross
it
at
the
first
summons
of
love
my
eyes
delighted
revelled
along
the
graceful
curves
that
outlined
the
beautiful
being
before
me
i
thought
i
had
seen
the
face
somewhere
i
had
but
a
moment
before
while
looking
upon
that
of
the
elder
lady
they
were
the
same
face
using
a
figure
of
speech
the
type
transmitted
from
mother
to
daughter
the
same
high
front
and
facial
angle
the
same
outline
of
the
nose
straight
as
a
ray
of
light
with
the
delicate
curve
of
the
nostril
which
meets
you
in
the
greek
medallion
their
hair
too
was
alike
in
colour
golden
though
in
that
of
the
mother
the
gold
showed
an
enamel
of
silver
i
will
desist
and
spare
details
which
to
you
may
be
of
little
interest
in
return
do
me
the
favour
to
believe
that
the
being
who
impressed
me
then
and
for
ever
was
beautiful
was
lovely
ah
it
wod
be
ver
moch
kindness
if
madame
and
wod
play
la
marseillaise
la
grande
marseillaise
what
say
mein
liebe
fraulein
zoe
zoe
take
thy
bandolin
yes
doctor
we
will
play
it
for
you
with
pleasure
you
like
the
music
so
do
we
come
zoe
the
young
girl
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
watching
intently
the
labours
of
the
naturalist
glided
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
room
and
taking
up
an
instrument
resembling
the
guitar
returned
and
seated
herself
by
her
mother
the
bandolin
was
soon
placed
in
concert
with
the
harp
and
the
strings
of
both
vibrated
to
the
thrilling
notes
of
the
marseillaise
there
was
something
exceedingly
graceful
in
the
performance
the
instrumentation
as
i
thought
was
perfect
and
the
voices
of
the
players
accompanied
it
in
a
sweet
and
spirited
harmony
as
i
gazed
upon
the
girl
zoe
her
features
animated
by
the
thrilling
thoughts
of
the
anthem
her
whole
countenance
radiant
with
light
she
seemed
some
immortal
being
a
young
goddess
of
liberty
calling
her
children
to
arms
the
botanist
had
desisted
from
his
labours
and
stood
listening
with
delighted
attention
at
each
return
of
the
thrilling
invocation
aux
armes
citoyens
the
old
man
snapped
his
fingers
and
beat
the
floor
with
his
feet
marking
the
time
of
the
music
he
was
filled
with
the
same
spirit
which
at
that
time
over
all
europe
was
gathering
to
its
crisis
where
am
i
french
faces
french
music
french
voices
and
the
conversation
in
french
for
the
botanist
addressed
the
females
in
that
language
though
with
a
strong
rhenish
patois
that
confirmed
my
first
impressions
of
his
nationality
where
am
i
my
eye
ran
around
the
room
in
search
of
an
answer
i
could
recognise
the
furniture
the
campeachy
chairs
a
rebozo
the
petate
ha
alp
the
dog
lay
stretched
along
the
mattress
near
my
couch
and
sleeping

oh

mamma
ecoutez
the
stranger
calls
the
dog
sprang
to
his
feet
and
throwing
his
fore
paws
upon
the
bed
stretched
his
nose
towards
me
with
a
joyous
whimpering
i
reached
out
my
hand
and
patted
him
at
the
same
time
giving
utterance
to
some
expressions
of
endearment
oh
mamma
mamma
he
knows
him
voila
the
lady
rose
hastily
and
approached
the
bed
the
german
seized
me
by
the
wrist
pushing
back
the
saint

which
was
bounding
to
spring

and
blushed

she
said

oh

then
both
mother
and
daughter
took
up
their
instruments
and
again
commenced
playing
i
listened
to
the
sweet
strains
watching
the
fair
musicians
a
long
while
my
eyes
at
length
became
heavy
and
the
realities
before
me
changed
into
the
soft
outlines
of
a
dream
my
dream
was
broken
by
the
abrupt
cessation
of
the
music
i
thought
i
heard
through
my
sleep
the
opening
of
a
door
when
i
looked
to
the
spot
lately
occupied
by
the
musicians
i
saw
that
they
were
gone
the
bandolin
had
been
thrown
down
upon
the
ottoman
where
it
lay
but
she
was
not
there
i
could
not
from
my
position
see
the
whole
of
the
apartment
but
i
knew
that
someone
had
entered
at
the
outer
door
i
heard
expressions
of
welcome
and
endearment
a
rustling
of
dresses
the
words
papa
my
little
zoe
the
latter
uttered
in
the
voice
of
a
man
then
followed
some
explanations
in
a
lower
tone
which
i
could
not
hear
a
few
minutes
elapsed
and
i
lay
silent
and
listening
presently
there
were
footsteps
in
the
hall
a
boot
with
its
jingling
rowels
struck
upon
the
tiled
floor
the
footsteps
entered
the
room
and
approached
the
bed
i
started
as
i
looked
up
the
was
before
me
chapter
thirteen
seguin
you
are
better
you
will
soon
be
well
again
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
recover
he
said
this
without
offering
his
hand
i
am
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
is
it
not
so
it
is
strange
that
i
felt
convinced
of
this
the
moment
that
i
set
my
eyes
upon
the
man
i
think
such
an
idea
crossed
my
mind
before
after
awaking
from
my
long
dream
had
i
encountered
him
in
my
struggles
for
water
or
had
i
dreamed
it
oh
yes
answered
he
with
a
smile
but
you
will
remember
that
i
had
something
to
do
with
your
being
exposed
to
the
risk
of
losing
it
will
you
take
this
hand
will
you
forgive
me
after
all
there
is
something
selfish
even
in
gratitude
how
strangely
had
it
changed
my
feelings
towards
this
man
i
was
begging
the
hand
which
but
a
few
days
before
in
the
pride
of
my
morality
i
had
spurned
from
me
as
a
loathsome
thing
but
there
were
other
thoughts
that
influenced
me
the
man
before
me
was
the
husband
of
the
lady
was
the
father
of
zoe
his
character
his
horrid
calling
were
forgotten
and
the
next
moment
our
hands
were
joined
in
the
embrace
of
friendship
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
i
honour
the
sentiment
that
induced
you
to
act
as
you
did
this
declaration
may
seem
strange
to
you
from
what
you
knew
of
me
you
acted
rightly
but
there
may
be
a
time
sir
when
you
will
know
me
better
when
the
deeds
which
you
abhor
may
seem
not
only
pardonable
but
justifiable
enough
of
this
at
present
the
object
of
my
being
now
at
your
bedside
is
to
request
that
what
you
do
know
of
me
be
not
uttered
here
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
as
he
said
this
pointing
at
the
same
time
towards
the
door
of
the
room
but
how
i
asked
wishing
to
draw
his
attention
from
this
unpleasant
theme
how
came
i
into
this
house
it
is
yours
i
perceive
how
came
i
here
where
did
you
find
me
in
no
very
safe
position
answered
he
with
a
smile
i
can
scarcely
claim
the
merit
of
saving
you
your
noble
horse
you
may
thank
for
that
ah
my
horse
my
brave
moro
i
have
lost
him
your
horse
is
standing
at
the
not
ten
paces
from
where
you
lie
i
think
you
will
find
him
in
somewhat
better
condition
than
when
you
last
saw
him
your
mules
are
without
your
packs
are
safe
you
will
find
them
here
and
he
pointed
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
gode
you
would
ask
for
said
he
interrupting
me
do
not
be
uneasy
on
his
account
he
too
is
in
safety
he
is
absent
just
now
but
will
soon
return
how
can
i
thank
you
this
is
good
news
indeed
my
brave
moro
and
alp
here
but
how
you
say
my
horse
saved
me
he
has
done
so
before
how
can
this
be
simply
thus
we
found
you
many
miles
from
this
place
on
a
cliff
that
overlooks
the
del
norte
you
were
hanging
over
on
your
lasso
that
by
a
lucky
accident
had
become
entangled
around
your
body
one
end
of
it
was
knotted
to
the
and
the
noble
animal
thrown
back
upon
his
haunches
sustained
your
weight
upon
his
neck
noble
moro
what
a
terrible
situation
ay
you
may
say
that
had
you
fallen
from
it
you
would
have
passed
through
a
thousand
feet
of
air
before
striking
the
rocks
below
it
was
indeed
a
fearful
situation
i
must
have
staggered
over
in
my
search
for
water
in
your
delirium
you
walked
over
you
would
have
done
so
a
second
time
had
we
not
prevented
you
when
we
drew
you
up
on
the
cliff
you
struggled
hard
to
get
back
you
saw
the
water
below
but
not
the
precipice
thirst
is
a
terrible
thing
an
insanity
of
itself
i
remember
something
of
all
this
i
thought
it
had
been
a
dream
do
not
trouble
your
brain
with
these
things
the
doctor
here
admonishes
me
to
leave
you
i
have
an
object
as
i
have
said
here
a
sad
expression
passed
over
the
countenance
of
the
speaker
else
i
should
not
have
paid
you
this
visit
i
have
not
many
moments
to
spare
i
must
be
far
hence
in
a
few
days
i
shall
return
meanwhile
compose
yourself
and
get
well
the
doctor
here
will
see
that
you
want
for
nothing
my
wife
and
daughter
will
nurse
you
thanks
thanks
you
will
do
well
to
remain
where
you
are
until
your
friends
return
from
chihuahua
they
must
pass
not
far
from
this
place
and
i
will
warn
you
when
they
are
near
you
are
a
student
there
are
books
here
in
different
languages
amuse
yourself
they
will
give
you
music
monsieur
adieu
stay
sir
one
moment
you
seem
to
have
taken
a
strange
fancy
to
my
horse
ah
monsieur
it
was
no
fancy
but
i
will
explain
that
at
some
other
time
perhaps
the
necessity
no
longer
exists
take
him
if
you
will
another
will
serve
my
purpose
no
monsieur
do
you
think
i
could
rob
you
of
what
you
esteem
so
highly
and
with
such
just
reason
too
no
no
keep
the
good
moro
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
attachment
to
the
noble
brute
you
say
that
you
have
a
long
journey
then
take
him
for
the
time
that
offer
i
will
freely
accept
for
indeed
my
own
horse
is
somewhat
jaded
i
have
been
two
days
in
the
saddle
well
adieu
seguin
pressed
my
hand
and
walked
away
i
heard
the
chinck
chinck
of
his
spurs
as
he
crossed
the
apartment
and
the
next
moment
the
door
closed
behind
him
i
was
alone
and
lay
listening
to
every
sound
that
reached
me
from
without
in
about
half
an
hour
after
he
had
left
me
i
heard
the
of
a
horse
and
saw
the
shadow
of
a
horseman
passing
outside
the
window
he
had
departed
on
his
journey
doubtless
on
the
performance
of
some
red
duty
connected
with
his
fearful
avocation
i
lay
for
a
while
harassed
in
mind
thinking
of
this
strange
man
then
sweet
voices
interrupted
my
meditations
before
me
appeared
lovely
faces
and
the
was
forgotten
chapter
fourteen
love
i
would
compress
the
history
of
the
ten
days
following
into
as
many
words
i
would
not
weary
you
with
the
details
of
my
love
a
love
that
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
became
a
passion
deep
and
ardent
i
was
young
at
the
time
at
just
such
an
age
as
to
be
impressed
by
the
romantic
incidents
that
surrounded
me
and
had
thrown
this
beautiful
being
in
my
way
at
that
age
when
the
heart
unguarded
by
cold
calculations
of
the
future
yields
unresistingly
to
the
electrical
impressions
of
love
i
say
electrical
i
believe
that
at
this
age
the
sympathies
that
spring
up
between
heart
and
heart
are
purely
of
this
nature
at
a
later
period
of
life
that
power
is
dissipated
and
divided
reason
rules
it
we
become
conscious
of
the
capability
of
transferring
our
affections
for
they
have
already
broken
faith
and
we
lose
that
sweet
confidence
that
comforted
the
loves
of
our
youth
we
are
either
imperious
or
jealous
as
the
advantages
appear
in
our
favour
or
against
us
a
gross
alloy
enters
into
the
love
of
our
middle
life
sadly
detracting
from
the
divinity
of
its
character
i
might
call
that
which
i
then
felt
my
first
real
passion
i
thought
i
had
loved
before
but
no
it
was
only
a
dream
the
dream
of
the
village
schoolboy
who
saw
heaven
in
the
bright
eyes
of
his
coy
or
perhaps
at
the
family
picnic
in
some
romantic
dell
had
tasted
the
rosy
cheek
of
his
pretty
cousin
i
grew
strong
and
with
a
rapidity
that
surprised
the
skilful
man
of
herbs
love
fed
and
nourished
the
fire
of
life
the
will
often
effects
the
deed
and
say
as
you
may
volition
has
its
power
upon
the
body
the
wish
to
be
well
to
live
an
object
to
live
for
are
often
the
speediest
restoratives
they
were
mine
i
grew
stronger
and
rose
from
my
couch
a
glance
at
the
mirror
told
me
that
my
colour
was
returning
instinct
teaches
the
bird
while
wooing
his
mate
to
plume
his
pinions
to
their
highest
gloss
and
a
similar
feeling
now
rendered
me
solicitous
about
my
toilet
my
portmanteau
was
ransacked
my
razors
were
drawn
forth
the
beard
disappeared
from
my
chin
and
my
moustache
was
trimmed
to
its
wonted
dimensions
i
confess
all
this
the
world
had
told
me
i
was
not
and
i
believed
what
it
said
i
am
mortal
in
my
vanities
are
not
you
there
was
a
guitar
in
the
house
i
had
learnt
in
my
college
days
to
touch
the
strings
and
its
music
delighted
both
zoe
and
her
mother
i
sang
to
them
the
songs
of
my
own
land
songs
of
love
and
with
a
throbbing
heart
watched
whether
the
burning
words
produced
any
impression
upon
her
more
than
once
i
have
laid
aside
the
instrument
with
feelings
of
disappointment
from
day
to
day
strange
reflections
passed
through
my
mind
could
it
be
that
she
was
too
young
to
understand
the
import
of
the
word
love
too
young
to
be
inspired
with
a
passion
she
was
but
twelve
years
of
age
but
then
she
was
the
child
of
a
sunny
clime
and
i
had
often
seen
at
that
age
under
the
warm
sky
of
mexico
the
wedded
bride
the
fond
mother
day
after
day
we
were
together
alone
the
botanist
was
busy
with
his
studies
and
the
silent
mother
occupied
with
the
duties
of
her
household
love
is
not
blind
it
may
be
to
all
the
world
beside
but
to
its
own
object
it
is
as
watchful
as
argus
i
was
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
crayon
and
i
amused
my
companion
by
sketches
upon
scraps
of
paper
and
the
blank
leaves
of
her
music
many
of
these
were
the
figures
of
females
in
different
attitudes
and
costumes
in
one
respect
they
resembled
each
other
their
faces
were
alike
the
child
without
divining
the
cause
had
noticed
this
peculiarity
in
the
drawings
why
is
it
she
asked
one
day
as
we
sat
together
these
ladies
are
all
in
different
costumes
of
different
nations
are
they
not
and
yet
there
is
a
resemblance
in
their
faces
they
have
all
the
same
features
indeed
exactly
the
same
i
think
it
is
your
face
zoe
i
can
sketch
no
other
she
raised
her
large
eyes
and
bent
them
upon
me
with
an
expression
of
innocent
wonder
was
she
blushing
no
is
that
like
me
it
is
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
it
and
why
do
you
not
sketch
other
faces
why
because
i
zoe
i
fear
you
would
not
understand
me
oh
enrique
do
you
think
me
so
bad
a
scholar
do
i
not
understand
all
that
you
tell
me
of
the
far
countries
where
you
have
been
surely
i
may
comprehend
this
as
well
i
will
tell
you
then
zoe
i
bent
forward
with
a
burning
heart
and
trembling
voice
it
is
because
your
face
is
ever
before
me
i
can
paint
no
other
it
is
that
i
love
you
zoe
oh
is
that
the
reason
and
when
you
love
one
her
face
is
always
before
you
whether
she
herself
be
present
or
no
is
it
not
so
it
is
so
i
replied
with
a
painful
feeling
of
disappointment
and
is
that
love
enrique
it
is
then
must
i
love
you
for
wherever
i
may
be
i
can
see
your
face
how
plainly
before
me
if
i
could
use
this
pencil
as
you
do
i
am
sure
i
could
paint
it
though
you
were
not
near
me
what
then
do
you
think
i
love
you
enrique
no
pen
could
trace
my
feelings
at
that
moment
we
were
seated
and
the
sheet
on
which
were
the
sketches
was
held
jointly
between
us
my
hand
wandered
over
its
surface
until
the
unresisting
fingers
of
my
companion
were
clasped
in
mine
a
wilder
emotion
followed
the
electric
touch
the
paper
fell
upon
the
floor
and
with
a
proud
but
trembling
heart
i
drew
the
yielding
form
to
mine
chapter
fifteen
light
and
shade
the
house
we
inhabited
stood
in
a
quadrangular
inclosure
that
sloped
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
the
del
norte
this
inclosure
was
a
garden
or
shrubbery
guarded
on
all
sides
by
high
thick
walls
of
adobe
along
the
summit
of
these
walls
had
been
planted
rows
of
the
cactus
that
threw
out
huge
thorny
limbs
forming
an
impassable
there
was
but
one
entrance
to
the
house
and
garden
through
a
strong
wicket
gate
which
i
had
noticed
was
always
shut
and
barred
i
had
no
desire
to
go
abroad
the
garden
a
large
one
hitherto
had
formed
the
limit
of
my
walk
and
through
this
i
often
rambled
with
zoe
and
her
mother
but
oftener
with
zoe
alone
there
were
many
objects
of
interest
about
the
place
it
was
a
ruin
and
the
house
itself
bore
evidences
of
better
times
it
was
a
large
building
in
the
style
with
flat
roof
azotea
and
notched
parapet
running
along
the
front
here
and
there
the
little
stone
turrets
of
this
parapet
had
fallen
off
showing
evidence
of
neglect
and
decay
the
walls
of
the
garden
impinged
upon
the
river
and
there
ended
for
the
bank
was
steep
and
vertical
and
the
deep
still
water
that
ran
under
it
formed
a
sufficient
protection
on
that
side
a
thick
grove
of
fringed
the
bank
of
the
river
and
under
their
shade
had
been
erected
a
number
of
seats
of
japanned
in
a
style
peculiar
to
spanish
countries
there
were
steps
cut
in
the
face
of
the
bank
overhung
with
drooping
shrubs
and
leading
to
the
water
edge
i
had
noticed
a
small
skiff
moored
under
the
willows
where
these
steps
went
down
to
the
water
from
this
point
only
could
you
see
beyond
the
limits
of
the
inclosure
the
view
was
magnificent
and
commanded
the
windings
of
the
del
norte
for
a
distance
of
miles
evening
after
evening
we
sought
the
grove
of
and
seated
upon
one
of
the
benches
together
watched
the
glowing
sunset
at
this
time
of
the
day
we
were
ever
alone
i
and
my
little
companion
one
evening
as
usual
we
sat
under
the
solemn
shadow
of
the
grove
we
had
brought
with
us
the
guitar
and
bandolin
but
after
a
few
notes
had
been
struck
the
music
was
forgotten
and
the
instruments
lay
upon
the
grass
at
our
feet
we
loved
to
listen
to
the
music
of
our
own
voices
we
preferred
the
utterance
of
our
own
thoughts
to
the
sentiments
of
any
song
however
sweet
there
was
music
enough
around
us
the
hum
of
the
wild
bee
as
it
bade
farewell
to
the
closing
corolla
the
whoop
of
the
gruya
in
the
distant
sedge
and
the
soft
cooing
of
the
doves
as
they
sat
in
pairs
upon
the
adjacent
branches
like
us
whispering
their
mutual
loves
autumn
had
now
painted
the
woods
and
the
frondage
was
of
every
hue
the
shadows
of
the
tall
trees
dappled
the
surface
of
the
water
as
the
stream
rolled
silently
on
the
sun
was
far
down
and
the
spire
of
el
paso
gleamed
like
a
golden
star
under
the
parting
kiss
of
his
beams
our
eyes
wandered
and
rested
upon
the
glittering
vane
the
church
half
soliloquised
my
companion
i
hardly
know
what
it
is
like
it
is
so
long
since
i
saw
it
how
long
oh
many
many
years
i
was
very
young
then
and
you
have
not
been
beyond
these
walls
since
then
oh
yes
papa
has
taken
us
down
the
river
in
the
boat
mamma
and
myself
often
but
not
lately
and
have
you
no
wish
to
go
abroad
through
these
gay
woods
i
do
not
desire
it
i
am
contented
here
and
will
you
always
be
contented
here
and
why
not
enrique
when
you
are
near
me
why
should
i
not
be
happy
but
when
a
dark
shadow
seemed
to
cross
her
thoughts
benighted
with
love
she
had
never
reflected
upon
the
probability
of
my
leaving
her
nor
indeed
had
i
her
cheeks
became
suddenly
pale
and
i
could
see
the
agony
gathering
in
her
eyes
as
she
fixed
them
upon
me
but
the
words
were
out
when
i
must
leave
you
she
threw
herself
on
my
breast
with
a
short
sharp
scream
as
though
she
had
been
stung
to
the
heart
and
in
an
impassioned
voice
cried
aloud
oh
my
god
my
god
leave
me
leave
me
oh
you
will
not
leave
me
you
who
have
taught
me
to
love
oh
enrique
why
did
you
tell
me
that
you
loved
me
why
did
you
teach
me
to
love
zoe
enrique
enrique
say
you
will
not
leave
me
never
zoe
i
swear
it
never
never
i
fancied
at
this
moment
i
heard
the
stroke
of
an
oar
but
the
wild
tumult
of
my
feelings
prevented
me
from
rising
to
look
over
the
bank
i
was
raising
my
head
when
an
object
appearing
above
the
bank
caught
my
eye
it
was
a
black
sombrero
with
its
golden
band
i
knew
the
wearer
at
a
glance
seguin
in
a
moment
he
was
beside
us
papa
exclaimed
zoe
rising
up
and
reaching
forward
to
embrace
him
the
father
put
her
to
one
side
at
the
same
time
tightly
grasping
her
hand
in
his
for
a
moment
he
remained
silent
bending
his
eyes
upon
me
with
an
expression
i
can
not
depict
there
was
in
it
a
mixture
of
reproach
sorrow
and
indignation
i
had
risen
to
confront
him
but
i
quailed
under
that
singular
glance
and
stood
abashed
and
silent
and
this
is
the
way
you
have
thanked
me
for
saving
your
life
a
brave
return
good
sir
what
think

made

continued
he
in
a
voice

emotion

the
accusation

he
turned
to
her
with
a
look
of
astonishment

he
exclaimed
oh

child
my
child
his
voice
stung
me
for

full
of
sorrow

mine
what
crime

i
committed
wherein
have
i
wronged
you
he
looked
at
me
for
some
moments
without
making
any
reply
you
would
marry
her
then
he
said
at
length
with
an
evident
change
in
his
manner
had
i
permitted
our
love
thus
far
without
that
intention
i
should
have
merited
your
reproaches
i
should
have
been

have
said

exclaimed
zoe
with
a
look
of
bewilderment

the
meaning
of
the
word

zoe
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
he
led
her
towards
the
house
i
followed
close
behind
as
we
passed
through
a
clump
of
wild
orange
trees
the
path
narrowed
and
the
father
letting
go
her
hand
walked
on
ahead
zoe
was
between
us
and
as
we
reached
the
middle
of
the
grove
she
turned
suddenly
and
laying
her
hand
upon
mine
whispered
in
a
trembling
voice
enrique

what

explain
another
time

chapter
sixteen
an
autobiography
i
was
alone
with
my
host
in
the
apartment
i
had
hitherto
occupied
the
females
had
retired
to
another
part
of
the
house
and
i
noticed
that
seguin
on
entering
had
looked
to
the
door
turning
the
bolt
what
terrible
proof
was
he
going
to
exact
of
my
faith
of
my
love
was
he
about
to
take
my
life
or
bind
me
by
some
fearful
oath
this
man
of
cruel
deeds
dark
suspicions
shot
across
my
mind
and
i
sat
silent
but
not
without
emotions
of
fear
a
bottle
of
wine
was
placed
between
us
and
seguin
pouring
out
two
glasses
asked
me
to
drink
this
courtesy
assured
me
but
how
if
the
wine
be
poi
he
swallowed
his
own
glass
before
the
thought
had
fairly
shaped
itself
i
am
wronging
him
thought
i
this
man
with
all
is
incapable
of
an
act
of
treachery
like
that
i
drank
up
the
wine
it
made
me
feel
more
composed
and
tranquil
after
a
moment
silence
he
opened
the
conversation
with
the
abrupt
interrogatory
what
do
you
know
of
me
your
name
and
calling
nothing
more
more
than
is
guessed
at
here
and
he
pointed
significantly
to
the
door
who
told
you
thus
much
of
me
a
friend
whom
you
saw
at
santa
fe
ah
saint
vrain
a
brave
bold
man
i
met
him
once
in
chihuahua
did
he
tell
you
no
more
of
me
than
this
no
he
promised
to
enter
into
particulars
concerning
you
but
the
subject
was
forgotten
the
caravan
moved
on
and
we
were
separated
you
heard
then
that
i
was
seguin
the
that
i
was
employed
by
the
citizens
of
el
paso
to
hunt
the
apache
and
navajo
and
that
i
was
paid
a
stated
sum
for
every
indian
scalp
i
could
hang
upon
their
gates
you
heard
all
this
i
did
it
is
true
i
remained
silent
now
sir
he
continued
after
a
pause
would
you
marry
my
daughter
the
child
of
a
wholesale
murderer
your
crimes
are
not
hers
she
is
innocent
even
of
the
knowledge
of
them
as
you
have
said
you
may
be
a
demon
she
is
an
angel
there
was
a
sad
expression
on
his
countenance
as
i
said
this
crimes
demon
he
muttered
half
in
soliloquy
ay
you
may
well
think
this
so
judges
the
world
you
have
heard
the
stories
of
the
mountain
men
in
all
their
red
exaggeration
you
have
heard
that
during
a
treaty
i
invited
a
village
of
the
apaches
to
a
banquet
and
poisoned
the
viands
poisoned
the
guests
man
woman
and
child
and
then
scalped
them
you
have
heard
that
i
induced
to
pull
upon
the
drag
rope
of
a
cannon
two
hundred
savages
who
know
not
its
use
and
then
fired
the
piece
loaded
with
grape
mowing
down
the
row
of
unsuspecting
wretches
these
and
other
inhuman
acts
you
have
no
doubt
heard
of
it
is
true
i
have
heard
these
stories
among
the
mountain
hunters
but
i
knew
not
whether
to
believe
them
monsieur
they
are
false
all
false
and
unfounded
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
this
i
could
not
now
believe
you
capable
of
such
barbarities
and
yet
if
they
were
true
in
all
their
horrid
details
they
would
fall
far
short
of
the
cruelties
that
have
been
dealt
out
by
the
savage
foe
to
the
inhabitants
of
this
defenceless
frontier
if
you
knew
the
history
of
this
land
for
the
last
ten
years
its
massacres
and
its
murders
its
tears
and
its
burnings
its
spoliations
whole
provinces
depopulated
villages
given
to
the
flames
men
butchered
on
their
own
hearths
women
beautiful
women
carried
into
captivity
by
the
desert
robber
oh
god
and
i
too
have
shared
wrongs
that
will
acquit
me
in
your
eyes
perhaps
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
the
speaker
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
leant
forward
upon
the
table
he
was
evidently
suffering
from
some
painful
recollection
after
a
moment
he
resumed
i
would
have
you
listen
to
a
short
history
of
my
life
i
signified
my
assent
and
after
filling
and
drinking
another
glass
of
wine
he
proceeded
i
am
not
a
frenchman
as
men
suppose
i
am
a
creole
a
native
of
new
orleans
my
parents
were
refugees
from
saint
domingo
where
after
the
black
revolution
the
bulk
of
their
fortune
was
confiscated
by
the
bloody
christophe
i
was
educated
for
a
civil
engineer
and
in
this
capacity
i
was
brought
out
to
the
mines
of
mexico
by
the
owner
of
one
of
them
who
knew
my
father
i
was
young
at
the
time
and
i
spent
several
years
employed
in
the
mines
of
zacatecas
and
san
luis
potosi
i
had
saved
some
money
out
of
my
pay
and
i
began
to
think
of
opening
upon
my
own
account
rumours
had
long
been
current
that
rich
veins
of
gold
existed
upon
the
gila
and
its
tributaries
the
washings
had
been
seen
and
gathered
in
these
rivers
and
the
mother
of
gold
the
milky
quartz
rock
cropped
out
everywhere
in
the
desert
mountains
of
this
wild
region
i
started
for
this
country
with
a
select
party
and
after
traversing
it
for
weeks
in
the
mimbres
mountains
near
the
head
waters
of
the
gila
i
found
the
precious
ore
in
its
bed
i
established
a
mine
and
in
five
years
was
a
rich
man
i
remembered
the
companion
of
my
youth
the
gentle
the
beautiful
cousin
who
had
shared
my
confidence
and
inspired
me
with
my
first
passion
with
me
it
was
first
and
last
it
was
not
as
is
often
the
case
under
similar
circumstances
a
transient
thing
through
all
my
wanderings
i
had
remembered
and
loved
her
had
she
been
as
true
to
me
i
determined
to
assure
myself
and
leaving
my
affairs
in
the
hands
of
my
mayoral
i
set
out
for
my
native
city
adele
had
been
true
and
i
returned
bringing
her
with
me
i
built
a
house
in
valverde
the
nearest
inhabited
district
to
my
mine
valverde
was
then
a
thriving
place
it
is
now
a
ruin
which
you
may
have
seen
in
your
journey
down
in
this
place
we
lived
for
years
in
the
enjoyment
of
wealth
and
happiness
i
look
back
upon
those
days
as
so
many
ages
of
bliss
our
love
was
mutual
and
ardent
and
we
were
blessed
with
two
children
both
girls
the
youngest
resembled
her
mother
the
other
i
have
been
told
was
more
like
myself
we
doted
i
fear
too
much
on
these
pledges
we
were
too
happy
in
their
possession
at
this
time
a
new
governor
was
sent
to
santa
fe
a
man
who
by
his
wantonness
and
tyranny
has
since
then
ruined
the
province
there
has
been
no
act
too
vile
no
crime
too
dark
for
this
human
monster
he
offered
fair
enough
at
first
and
was
feasted
in
the
houses
of
the
ricos
through
the
valley
as
i
was
classed
among
these
i
was
honoured
with
his
visits
and
frequently
he
resided
principally
at
albuquerque
and
grand
fetes
were
given
at
his
palace
to
which
my
wife
and
i
were
invited
as
special
guests
he
in
return
often
came
to
our
house
in
valverde
under
pretence
of
visiting
the
different
parts
of
the
province
i
discovered
at
length
that
his
visits
were
solely
intended
for
my
wife
to
whom
he
had
paid
some
flattering
attentions
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
beauty
of
adele
at
this
time
you
may
imagine
that
for
yourself
and
monsieur
you
may
assist
your
imagination
by
allowing
it
to
dwell
on
those
graces
you
appear
to
have
discovered
in
her
daughter
for
the
little
zoe
is
a
type
of
what
her
mother
was
at
the
time
i
speak
of
she
was
still
in
the
bloom
of
her
beauty
the
fame
of
that
beauty
was
on
every
tongue
and
had
piqued
the
vanity
of
the
wanton
tyrant
for
this
reason
i
became
the
object
of
his
friendly
assiduities
i
had
divined
this
but
confiding
in
the
virtue
of
my
wife
i
took
no
notice
of
his
conduct
no
overt
act
of
insult
as
yet
claimed
my
attention
returning
on
one
occasion
from
a
long
absence
at
the
mines
adele
informed
me
what
through
delicacy
she
had
hitherto
concealed
of
insults
received
from
his
excellency
at
various
times
but
particularly
in
a
visit
he
had
paid
her
during
my
absence
this
was
enough
for
creole
blood
i
repaired
to
albuquerque
and
on
the
public
plaza
in
presence
of
the
multitude
i
chastised
the
insulter
i
was
seized
and
thrown
into
a
prison
where
i
lay
for
several
weeks
when
i
was
freed
and
sought
my
home
again
it
was
plundered
and
desolate
the
wild
navajo
had
been
there
my
household
gods
were
scattered
and
broken
and
my
child
oh
god
my
little
adele
was
carried
captive
to
the
mountains
and
your
wife
your
other
child
i
inquired
eager
to
know
the
rest
they
had
escaped
in
the
terrible
conflict
for
my
poor
peons
battled
bravely
my
wife
with
zoe
in
her
arms
had
rushed
out
and
hidden
in
a
cave
that
was
in
the
garden
i
found
them
in
the
ranche
of
a
vaquero
in
the
woods
whither
they
had
wandered
and
your
daughter
adele
have
you
heard
aught
of
her
since
yes
yes
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
moment
my
mine
at
the
same
time
was
plundered
and
destroyed
many
of
the
workmen
were
slaughtered
before
they
could
escape
and
the
work
itself
with
my
fortune
became
a
ruin
with
some
of
the
miners
who
had
fled
and
others
of
valverde
who
like
me
had
suffered
i
organised
a
band
and
followed
the
savage
foe
but
our
pursuit
was
vain
and
we
turned
back
many
of
us
broken
in
health
and
heart
oh
monsieur
you
can
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
thus
lost
a
favourite
child
you
can
not
understand
the
agony
of
the
bereaved
father
the
speaker
pressed
his
head
between
his
hands
and
remained
for
a
moment
silent
his
countenance
bore
the
indications
of
heartrending
sorrow
my
story
will
soon
be
told
up
to
the
present
time
who
knows
the
end
for
years
i
hung
upon
the
frontiers
of
the
indian
country
hunting
for
my
child
i
was
aided
by
a
small
band
most
of
them
unfortunates
like
myself
who
had
lost
wife
or
daughter
in
a
similar
manner
but
our
means
became
exhausted
and
despair
wore
us
out
the
sympathies
of
my
companions
grew
old
and
cold
one
after
another
gave
up
the
governor
of
new
mexico
offered
us
no
aid
on
the
contrary
it
was
suspected
then
it
is
now
known
that
the
governor
himself
was
in
secret
league
with
the
navajo
chiefs
he
had
engaged
to
leave
them
unmolested
while
they
on
their
side
promised
to
plunder
only
his
enemies
on
learning
this
terrible
secret
i
saw
the
hand
that
had
dealt
me
the
blow
stung
by
the
disgrace
i
had
put
upon
him
as
well
as
by
my
scorn
the
villain
was
not
slow
to
avenge
himself
since
then
his
life
has
been
twice
in
my
power
but
the
taking
of
it
would
most
probably
have
forfeited
my
own
and
i
had
objects
for
which
to
live
i
may
yet
find
a
reckoning
day
for
him
i
have
said
that
my
band
melted
away
sick
at
heart
and
conscious
of
danger
in
new
mexico
i
left
the
province
and
crossed
the
jornada
to
el
paso
here
for
a
while
i
lived
grieving
for
my
lost
child
i
was
not
long
inactive
the
frequent
forays
made
by
the
apaches
into
sonora
and
chihuahua
had
rendered
the
government
more
energetic
in
the
defence
of
the
frontier
the
presidios
were
repaired
and
garrisoned
with
more
efficient
troops
and
a
band
of
rangers
organised
whose
pay
was
proportioned
to
the
number
of
scalps
they
might
send
back
to
the
settlements
i
was
offered
the
command
of
this
strange
guerilla
and
in
the
hope
that
i
might
yet
recover
my
child
i
accepted
it
i
became
a
it
was
a
terrible
commission
and
had
revenge
alone
been
my
object
it
would
long
since
have
been
gratified
many
a
deed
of
blood
have
we
enacted
many
a
scene
of
retaliatory
vengeance
have
we
passed
through
i
knew
that
my
captive
daughter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
navajoes
i
had
heard
so
at
various
times
from
prisoners
whom
i
had
taken
but
i
was
always
crippled
for
want
of
strength
in
men
and
means
revolution
after
revolution
kept
the
states
in
poverty
and
civil
warfare
and
our
interests
were
neglected
or
forgotten
with
all
my
exertions
i
could
never
raise
a
force
sufficient
to
penetrate
that
desert
country
north
of
the
gila
in
which
lie
the
towns
of
the
savage
navajoes
and
you
think
patience
i
shall
soon
finish
my
band
is
now
stronger
than
ever
i
have
received
certain
information
by
one
just
escaped
from
a
captivity
among
the
navajoes
that
the
warriors
of
both
tribes
are
about
to
proceed
southward
they
are
mustering
all
their
strength
with
the
intention
of
making
a
grand
foray
even
as
we
have
heard
to
the
gates
of
durango
it
is
my
design
then
to
enter
their
country
while
they
are
absent
and
search
for
my
daughter
and
you
think
she
still
lives
i
know
it
the
same
man
who
brought
me
this
news
and
who
poor
fellow
has
left
his
scalp
and
ears
behind
him
saw
her
often
she
is
grown
up
and
is
he
says
a
sort
of
queen
among
them
possessed
of
strange
powers
and
privileges
yes
she
still
lives
and
if
it
be
my
fortune
to
recover
her
then
will
this
tragic
scene
be
at
an
end
i
will
go
far
hence
i
had
listened
with
deep
attention
to
the
strange
recital
all
the
disgust
with
which
my
previous
knowledge
of
this
man
character
had
inspired
me
vanished
from
my
mind
and
i
felt
for
him
compassion
ay
admiration
he
had
suffered
much
suffering
atones
for
crime
and
in
my
sight
he
was
justified
perhaps
i
was
too
lenient
in
my
judgment
it
was
natural
i
should
be
so
when
the
revelation
was
ended
i
was
filled
with
emotions
of
pleasure
i
felt
a
vivid
joy
to
know
that
she
was
not
the
offspring
of
the
demon
i
had
deemed
him
he
seemed
to
divine
my
thoughts
for
there
was
a
smile
of
satisfaction
i
might
say
triumph
on
his
countenance
as
he
leaned
across
the
table
to
refill
the
wine
monsieur
my
story
must
have
wearied
you
drink
there
was
a
moment
silence
as
we
emptied
the
glasses
and
now
sir
you
know
the
father
of
your
betrothed
at
least
somewhat
better
than
before
are
you
still
in
the
mind
to
marry
her
oh
sir
she
is
now
more
than
ever
to
me
a
sacred
object
but
you
must
win
her
as
i
have
said
from
me
then
sir
tell
me
how
i
am
ready
for
any
sacrifice
that
may
be
within
my
power
to
make
you
must
help
me
to
recover
her
sister
willingly
you
must
go
with
me
to
the
desert
i
will
enough
we
start
and
he
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
at
an
early
hour
i
inquired
half
fearing
that
i
was
about
to
be
denied
an
interview
with
her
whom
i
now
more
than
ever
longed
to
embrace
by
daybreak
he
replied
not
seeming
to
heed
my
anxious
manner
i
must
look
to
my
horse
and
arms
said
i
rising
and
going
towards
the
door
in
hopes
of
meeting
her
without
they
have
been
attended
to
gode
is
there
come
boy
she
is
not
in
the
hall
stay
where
you
are
i
will

the
arms

your
weeds

journey

some
coffee
love
and
then
let
us
have
some
music
your
guest
leaves
you
the
bright
form
rushed
between
us
with
a
scream
no
no
no
no
she
exclaimed
turning
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
wild
appeal
of
a
passionate
heart
come
little
dove
said
the
father
taking
her
by
the
hands
do
not
be
so
easily
fluttered
it
is
but
for
a
short
time
he
will
return
again
how
long
papa
how
long
enrique
but
a
very
short
while
it
will
be
longer
to
me
than
to
you
zoe
oh
no
no
an
hour

be
a
long
time

will
not
soon
pass
when
i
am
alone
but
you
will
not
be
alone
your
mamma
will
be
with
you
ah
and
with
a
sigh
and
an
air
of
abstraction
she
departed
to
obey
the
command
of
her
father
as
she
passed
out
at
the
door
she
again
sighed
audibly
the
doctor
was
a
silent
and
wondering
spectator
of
this
last
scene
and
as
her
figure
vanished
into
the
hall
i
could
hear
him
muttering
to
himself
oh
ja
poor
leetle
fraulein
i
thought
as
mosh
chapter
seventeen
up
the
del
norte
i
will
not
distress
you
with
a
parting
scene
we
were
in
our
saddles
before
the
stars
had
died
out
and
riding
along
the
sandy
road
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
the
path
angled
striking
into
thick
heavy
timber
here
i
checked
my
horse
allowing
my
companions
to
pass
and
standing
in
the
stirrup
looked
back
my
eyes
wandered
along
the
old
grey
walls
and
sought
the
azotea
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
parapet
outlined
against
the
pale
light
of
the
aurora
was
the
object
i
looked
for
i
could
not
distinguish
the
features
but
i
easily
recognised
the
oval
curvings
of
the
figure
cut
like
a
dark
medallion
against
the
sky
she
was
standing
near
one
of
the
yucca
palm
trees
that
grew
up
from
the
azotea
her
hand
rested
upon
its
trunk
and
she
bent
forward
straining
her
gaze
into
the
darkness
below
perhaps
she
saw
the
waving
of
a
kerchief
perhaps
she
heard
her
name
and
echoed
the
parting
prayer
that
was
sent
back
to
her
on
the
still
breath
of
the
morning
if
so
her
voice
was
drowned
by
the
tread
of
my
chafing
horse
that
wheeling
suddenly
bore
me
off
into
the
sombre
shadows
of
the
forest
i
rode
forward
turning
at
intervals
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
those
lovely
outlines
but
from
no
other
point
was
the
house
visible
it
lay
buried
in
the
dark
majestic
woods
i
could
only
see
the
long
bayonets
of
the
picturesque
palmillas
and
our
road
now
descending
among
hills
these
too
were
soon
hidden
from
my
view
dropping
the
bridle
and
leaving
my
horse
to
go
at
will
i
fell
into
a
train
of
thoughts
at
once
pleasant
and
painful
i
knew
that
i
had
inspired
this
young
creature
with
a
passion
deep
and
ardent
as
my
own
perhaps
more
vital
for
my
heart
had
passed
through
other
affections
while
hers
had
never
throbbed
with
any
save
the
subdued
solicitudes
of
a
graceful
childhood
she
had
never
known
emotion
love
was
her
first
strong
feeling
her
first
passion
would
it
not
thus
enthroned
reign
over
all
other
thoughts
in
her
kingdom
she
too
so
formed
for
love
so
like
its
mythic
goddess
these
reflections
were
pleasant
but
the
picture
darkened
as
i
turned
from
looking
back
for
the
last
time
and
something
whispered
me
some
demon
it
was
you
may
never
see
her
more
the
suggestion
even
in
this
hypothetical
form
was
enough
to
fill
my
mind
with
dark
forebodings
and
i
began
to
cast
my
thoughts
upon
the
future
i
was
going
upon
no
party
of
pleasure
from
which
i
might
return
at
a
fixed
hour
dangers
were
before
me
the
dangers
of
the
desert
and
i
knew
that
these
were
of
no
ordinary
character
in
our
plans
of
the
previous
night
seguin
had
not
concealed
the
perils
of
our
expedition
these
he
had
detailed
before
exacting
my
final
promise
to
accompany
him
weeks
before
i
would
not
have
regarded
them
they
would
only
have
lured
me
on
to
meet
them
now
my
feelings
were
different
for
i
believed
that
in
my
life
there
was
another
what
then
if
the
demon
had
whispered
truly
i
might
never
see
her
more
it
was
a
painful
thought
and
i
rode
on
bent
in
the
saddle
under
the
influence
of
its
bitterness
but
i
was
once
more
upon
the
back
of
my
favourite
moro
who
seemed
to
know
his
rider
and
as
his
elastic
body
heaved
beneath
me
my
spirit
answered
his
and
began
to
resume
its
wonted
buoyancy
after
a
while
i
took
up
the
reins
and
shortening
them
in
my
hands
spurred
on
after
my
companions
our
road
lay
up
the
river
crossing
the
shallow
ford
at
intervals
and
winding
through
the
that
were
heavily
timbered
the
path
was
difficult
on
account
of
the
thick
underwood
and
although
the
trees
had
once
been
blazed
for
a
road
there
were
no
signs
of
late
travel
upon
it
with
the
exception
of
a
few
solitary
the
country
appeared
wild
and
uninhabited
this
was
evident
from
the
frequency
with
which
deer
and
antelope
swept
across
our
path
or
sprang
out
of
the
underwood
close
to
our
horses
heads
here
and
there
our
path
trended
away
from
the
river
crossing
its
numerous
loops
several
times
we
passed
large
tracts
where
the
heavy
timber
had
been
felled
and
clearings
had
existed
but
this
must
have
been
long
ago
for
the
land
that
had
been
furrowed
by
the
plough
was
now
covered
with
tangled
and
almost
impenetrable
thickets
a
few
broken
and
decaying
logs
or
crumbling
walls
of
the
adobe
were
all
that
remained
to
attest
where
the
settlers
rancho
had
stood
we
passed
a
ruined
church
with
its
old
turrets
dropping
by
piecemeal
piles
of
adobe
lay
around
covering
the
ground
for
acres
a
thriving
village
had
stood
there
where
was
it
now
where
were
the
busy
gossips
a
sprang
over
the
walls
and
made
off
into
the
forest
an
owl
flew
sluggishly
up
from
the
crumbling
cupola
and
hovered
around
our
heads
uttering
its
doleful
that
rendered
the
desolation
of
the
scene
more
impressive
as
we
rode
through
the
ruin
a
dead
stillness
surrounded
us
broken
only
by
the
hooting
of
the
and
the
of
our
horses
feet
upon
the
fragments
of
pottery
that
covered
the
deserted
streets
but
where
were
they
who
had
once
made
these
walls
echo
with
their
voices
who
had
knelt
under
the
sacred
shadow
of
that
once
hallowed
pile
they
were
gone
but
where
and
when
and
why
i
put
these
questions
to
seguin
and
was
answered
thus
briefly
the
indians
the
savage
it
was
with
his
red
spear
and
his
bow
and
his
his
brand
and
his
poisoned
arrows
the
navajoes
i
inquired
navajo
and
apache
but
do
they
come
no
more
to
this
place
a
feeling
of
anxiety
had
suddenly
entered
my
mind
i
thought
of
our
proximity
to
the
mansion
we
had
left
i
thought
of
its
unguarded
walls
i
waited
with
some
impatience
for
an
answer
no
more
was
the
brief
reply
and
why
i
inquired
this
is
our
territory
he
answered
significantly
you
are
now
monsieur
in
a
country
where
live
strange
fellows
you
shall
see
woe
to
the
apache
or
navajo
who
may
stray
into
these
woods
as
we
rode
forward
the
country
became
more
open
and
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
high
bluffs
trending
north
and
south
on
both
sides
of
the
river
these
bluffs
converged
till
the
river
channel
appeared
to
be
completely
barred
up
by
a
mountain
this
was
only
an
appearance
on
riding
farther
we
found
ourselves
entering
one
of
those
fearful
gaps
canons
as
they
are
called
so
often
met
with
in
the
of
tropical
america
through
this
the
river
foamed
between
two
vast
cliffs
a
thousand
feet
in
height
whose
profiles
as
you
approached
them
suggested
the
idea
of
angry
giants
separated
by
some
almighty
hand
and
thus
left
frowning
at
each
other
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
awe
that
one
looked
up
the
face
of
these
stupendous
cliffs
and
i
felt
a
shuddering
sensation
as
i
neared
the
mighty
gate
between
them
do
you
see
that
point
asked
seguin
indicating
a
rock
that
jutted
out
from
the
highest
ledge
of
the
chasm
i
signified
in
the
affirmative
for
the
question
was
addressed
to
myself
that
is
the
leap
you
were
so
desirous
of
taking
we
found
you
dangling
against
yonder
rock
good
god
i
ejaculated
as
my
eyes
rested
upon
the
dizzy
eminence
my
brain
grew
giddy
as
i
sat
in
my
saddle
gazing
upward
and
i
was
fain
to
ride
onward
but
for
your
noble
horse
continued
my
companion
the
doctor
here
would
have
been
stopping
about
this
time
to
hypothecate
upon
your
bones
ho
moro
beautiful
moro
oh
mein
gott
ya
ya
assented
the
botanist
looking
up
against
the
precipice
apparently
with
a
feeling
of
awe
such
as
i
felt
myself
seguin
had
ridden
alongside
me
and
was
patting
my
horse
on
the
neck
with
expressions
of
admiration
but
why
i
asked
the
remembrance
of
our
first
interview
now
occurring
to
me
why
were
you
so
eager
to
possess
him
a
fancy
can
i
not
understand
it
i
think
you
said
then
that
i
could
not
oh
yes
quite
easily
monsieur
i
intended
to
steal
my
own
daughter
and
i
wanted
for
that
purpose
to
have
the
aid
of
your
horse
but
how
it
was
before
i
had
heard
the
news
of
this
intended
expedition
of
our
enemy
as
i
had
no
hopes
of
obtaining
her
otherwise
it
was
my
design
to
have
entered
their
country
alone
or
with
a
tried
comrade
and
by
stratagem
to
have
carried
her
off
their
horses
are
swift
yet
far
inferior
to
the
arab
as
you
may
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
with
such
an
animal
as
that
i
would
have
been
comparatively
safe
unless
hemmed
in
or
surrounded
and
even
then
i
might
have
got
off
with
a
few
scratches
i
intended
to
have
disguised
myself
and
entered
the
town
as
one
of
their
own
warriors
i
have
long
been
master
of
their
language
it
would
have
been
a
perilous
enterprise
true
it
was
a
and
only
adopted
because
all
other
efforts
had
failed
after
years
of
yearning
deep
craving
of
the
heart
i
might
have
perished
it
was
a
rash
thought
but
i
at
that
time
entertained
it
fully
i
hope
we
shall
succeed
now
i
have
high
hopes
it
seems
as
if
some
overruling
providence
were
now
acting
in
my
favour
this
absence
of
her
captors
and
besides
my
band
has
been
most
opportunely
strengthened
by
the
arrival
of
a
number
of
trappers
from
the
eastern
plains
the
have
fallen
according
to
their
phraseology
to
a
a
plug
and
they
find
pays
better
ah
i
hope
this
will
soon
be
over
and
he
sighed
deeply
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
we
were
now
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
and
a
shady
clump
of
invited
us
to
rest
let
us
noon
here
said
seguin
we
dismounted
and
ran
our
animals
out
on
their
to
feed
then
seating
ourselves
on
the
soft
grass
we
drew
forth
the
viands
that
had
been
prepared
for
our
journey
chapter
eighteen
geography
and
geology
we
rested
above
an
hour
in
the
cool
shade
while
our
horses
refreshed
themselves
on
the
grama
that
grew
luxuriantly
around
we
conversed
about
the
singular
region
in
which
we
were
travelling
singular
in
its
geography
its
geology
its
botany
and
its
history
singular
in
all
respects
i
am
a
traveller
as
i
might
say
by
profession
i
felt
an
interest
in
learning
something
of
the
wild
countries
that
stretched
for
hundreds
of
miles
around
us
and
i
knew
there
was
no
man
living
so
capable
of
being
my
informant
as
he
with
whom
i
then
conversed
my
journey
down
the
river
had
made
me
but
little
acquainted
with
its
features
at
that
time
as
i
have
already
related
there
was
fever
upon
me
and
my
memory
of
objects
was
as
though
i
had
encountered
them
in
some
distorted
dream
my
brain
was
now
clear
and
the
scenes
through
which
we
were
passing
here
soft
and
there
wild
barren
and
picturesque
forcibly
impressed
my
imagination
the
knowledge
too
that
parts
of
this
region
had
once
been
inhabited
by
the
followers
of
cortez
as
many
a
ruin
testified
that
it
had
been
surrendered
back
to
its
ancient
and
savage
lords
and
the
inference
that
this
surrender
had
been
brought
about
by
the
enactment
of
many
a
tragic
scene
induced
a
train
of
romantic
thought
which
yearned
for
gratification
in
an
acquaintance
with
the
realities
that
gave
rise
to
it
seguin
was
communicative
his
spirits
were
high
his
hopes
were
buoyant
the
prospect
of
again
embracing
his
child
imbued
him
as
it
were
with
new
life
he
had
not
he
said
felt
so
happy
for
many
years
it
is
true
said
he
in
answer
to
a
question
i
had
put
there
is
little
known
of
this
whole
region
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
mexican
settlements
they
who
once
had
the
opportunity
of
recording
its
geographical
features
have
left
the
task
undone
they
were
too
busy
in
the
search
for
gold
and
their
weak
descendants
as
you
see
are
too
busy
in
robbing
one
another
to
care
for
aught
else
they
know
nothing
of
the
country
beyond
their
own
borders
and
these
are
every
day
contracting
upon
them
all
they
know
of
it
is
the
fact
that
thence
come
their
enemies
whom
they
dread
as
children
do
ghosts
or
wolves
we
are
now
continued
seguin
near
the
centre
of
the
continent
in
the
very
heart
of
the
american
sahara
but
said
i
interrupting
him
we
can
not
be
more
than
a
day
ride
south
of
new
mexico
that
is
not
a
desert
it
is
a
cultivated
country
new
mexico
is
an
oasis
nothing
more
the
desert
is
around
it
for
hundreds
of
miles
nay
in
some
directions
you
may
travel
a
thousand
miles
from
the
del
norte
without
seeing
one
fertile
spot
new
mexico
is
an
oasis
which
owes
its
existence
to
the
irrigating
waters
of
the
del
norte
it
is
the
only
settlement
of
white
men
from
the
frontiers
of
the
mississippi
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
in
california
you
approached
it
by
a
desert
did
you
not
yes
as
we
ascended
from
the
mississippi
towards
the
rocky
mountains
the
country
became
gradually
more
sterile
for
the
last
three
hundred
miles
or
so
we
could
scarcely
find
grass
or
water
for
the
sustenance
of
our
animals
but
is
it
thus
north
and
south
of
the
route
we
travelled
north
and
south
for
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
the
plains
of
texas
to
the
lakes
of
canada
along
the
whole
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
to
the
settlements
on
the
mississippi
it
is
a
treeless
herbless
land
to
the
west
of
the
mountains
fifteen
hundred
miles
of
desert
that
is
its
length
by
at
least
half
as
many
miles
of
breadth
the
country
to
the
west
is
of
a
different
character
it
is
more
broken
in
its
outlines
more
mountainous
and
if
possible
more
sterile
in
its
aspect
the
volcanic
fires
have
been
more
active
there
and
though
that
may
have
been
thousands
of
years
ago
the
igneous
rocks
in
many
places
look
as
if
freshly
upheaved
no
vegetation
no
climatic
action
has
sensibly
changed
the
hues
of
the
lava
and
scoriae
that
in
some
places
cover
the
plains
for
miles
i
say
no
climatic
action
for
there
is
but
little
of
that
in
this
central
region
i
do
not
understand
you
what
i
mean
is
that
there
is
but
little
atmospheric
change
it
is
but
one
uniform
drought
it
is
seldom
tempestuous
or
rainy
i
know
some
districts
where
a
drop
of
rain
has
not
fallen
for
years
and
can
you
account
for
that
phenomenon
i
have
my
theory
it
may
not
satisfy
the
learned
meteorologist
but
i
will
offer
it
to
you
i
listened
with
attention
for
i
knew
that
my
companion
was
a
man
of
science
as
of
experience
and
observation
and
subjects
of
the
character
of
those
about
which
we
conversed
had
always
possessed
great
interest
for
me
he
continued
there
can
be
no
rain
without
vapour
in
the
air
there
can
be
no
vapour
in
the
air
without
water
on
the
earth
below
to
produce
it
here
there
is
no
great
body
of
water
nor
can
there
be
the
whole
region
of
the
desert
is
upheaved
an
elevated
we
are
now
nearly
six
thousand
feet
above
sea
level
hence
its
springs
are
few
and
by
hydraulic
law
must
be
fed
by
its
own
waters
or
those
of
some
region
still
more
elevated
which
does
not
exist
on
the
continent
could
i
create
vast
seas
in
this
region
walled
in
by
the
lofty
mountains
that
traverse
it
and
such
seas
existed
coeval
with
its
formation
could
i
create
those
seas
without
giving
them
an
outlet
not
even
allowing
the
smallest
rill
to
drain
them
in
process
of
time
they
would
empty
themselves
into
the
ocean
and
leave
everything
as
it
now
is
a
desert
but
how
by
evaporation
on
the
contrary
the
absence
of
evaporation
would
be
the
cause
of
their
drainage
i
believe
it
has
been
so
already
i
can
not
understand
that
it
is
simply
thus
this
region
possesses
as
we
have
said
great
elevation
consequently
a
cool
atmosphere
and
a
much
less
evaporating
power
than
that
which
draws
up
the
water
of
the
ocean
now
there
would
be
an
interchange
of
vapour
between
the
ocean
and
these
elevated
seas
by
means
of
winds
and
currents
for
it
is
only
by
that
means
that
any
water
can
reach
this
interior
plateau
that
interchange
would
result
in
favour
of
the
inland
seas
by
reason
of
their
less
evaporation
as
well
as
from
other
causes
we
have
not
time
or
i
could
demonstrate
such
a
result
i
beg
you
will
admit
it
then
and
reason
it
out
at
your
leisure
i
perceive
the
truth
i
perceive
it
at
once
what
follows
then
these
seas
would
gradually
fill
up
to
overflowing
the
first
little
rivulet
that
trickled
forth
from
their
lipping
fulness
would
be
the
signal
of
their
destruction
it
would
cut
its
channel
over
the
ridge
of
the
lofty
mountain
tiny
at
first
but
deepening
and
widening
with
each
successive
shower
until
after
many
years
ages
centuries
cycles
perhaps
a
great
gap
such
as
this
here
seguin
pointed
to
the
canon
and
the
dry
plain
behind
it
would
alone
exist
to
puzzle
the
geologist
and
you
think
that
the
plains
lying
among
the
andes
and
the
rocky
mountains
are
the
dry
beds
of
seas
i
doubt
it
not
seas
formed
after
the
upheaval
of
the
ridges
that
barred
them
in
formed
by
rains
from
the
ocean
at
first
shallow
then
deepening
until
they
had
risen
to
the
level
of
their
mountain
barriers
and
as
i
have
described
cut
their
way
back
again
to
the
ocean
but
does
not
one
of
these
seas
still
exist
the
great
salt
lake
it
does
it
lies
of
us
not
only
one
but
a
system
of
lakes
springs
and
rivers
both
salt
and
fresh
and
these
have
no
outlet
to
the
ocean
they
are
barred
in
by
highlands
and
mountains
of
themselves
forming
a
complete
geographical
system
does
not
that
destroy
your
theory
no
the
basin
in
which
this
phenomenon
exists
is
on
a
lower
level
than
most
of
the
desert
plateaux
its
evaporating
power
is
equal
to
the
influx
of
its
own
rivers
and
consequently
neutralises
their
effect
that
is
to
say
in
its
exchange
of
vapour
with
the
ocean
it
gives
as
much
as
it
receives
this
arises
not
so
much
from
its
low
elevation
as
from
the
peculiar
dip
of
the
mountains
that
guide
the
waters
into
its
bosom
place
it
in
a
colder
position
and
in
time
it
would
cut
the
canal
for
its
own
drainage
so
with
the
caspian
sea
the
aral
and
the
dead
sea
no
my
friend
the
existence
of
the
salt
lake
supports
my
theory
around
its
shores
lies
a
fertile
country
fertile
from
the
quick
returns
of
its
own
waters
moistening
it
with
rain
it
exists
only
to
a
limited
extent
and
can
not
influence
the
whole
region
of
the
desert
which
lies
parched
and
sterile
on
account
of
its
great
distance
from
the
ocean
but
does
not
the
vapour
rising
from
the
ocean
float
over
the
desert
it
does
as
i
have
said
to
some
extent
else
there
would
be
no
rain
here
sometimes
by
extraordinary
causes
such
as
high
winds
it
is
carried
into
the
heart
of
the
continent
in
large
masses
then
we
have
storms
and
fearful
ones
too
but
generally
it
is
only
the
skirt
of
a
cloud
so
to
speak
that
reaches
thus
far
and
that
combined
with
the
proper
evaporation
of
the
region
itself
that
is
from
its
own
springs
and
rivers
yields
all
the
rain
that
falls
upon
it
great
bodies
of
vapour
rising
from
the
pacific
and
drifting
eastward
first
impinge
upon
the
coast
range
and
there
deposit
their
waters
or
perhaps
they
are
more
and
soaring
above
the
tops
of
these
mountains
travel
farther
they
will
be
intercepted
a
hundred
miles
farther
on
by
the
loftier
ridges
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
carried
back
as
it
were
captive
to
the
ocean
by
the
streams
of
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquim
it
is
only
the
skirt
of
these
clouds
as
i
have
termed
it
that
soaring
still
higher
and
escaping
the
attractive
influence
of
the
nevada
floats
on
and
falls
into
the
desert
region
what
then
no
sooner
has
it
fallen
than
it
hurries
back
to
the
sea
by
the
gila
and
colorado
to
rise
again
and
fertilise
the
slopes
of
the
nevada
while
the
fragment
of
some
other
cloud
drifts
its
scanty
supply
over
the
arid
uplands
of
the
interior
to
be
spent
in
rain
or
snow
upon
the
peaks
of
the
rocky
mountains
hence
the
source
of
the
rivers
running
east
and
west
and
hence
the
oases
such
as
the
parks
that
lie
among
these
mountains
hence
the
fertile
valleys
upon
the
del
norte
and
other
streams
that
thinly
meander
through
this
central
land
from
the
atlantic
undergo
a
similar
detention
in
crossing
the
alleghany
range
or
cooling
after
having
circled
a
great
distance
round
the
globe
descend
into
the
valleys
of
the
ohio
and
mississippi
from
all
sides
of
this
great
continent
as
you
approach
its
centre
fertility
declines
and
only
from
the
want
of
water
the
soil
in
many
places
where
there
is
scarcely
a
blade
of
grass
to
be
seen
possesses
all
the
elements
of
vegetation
so
the
doctor
will
tell
you
he
has
analysed
it
ya
ya
dat
ish
true
quietly
affirmed
the
doctor
there
are
many
oases
continued
seguin
and
where
water
can
be
used
to
irrigate
the
soil
luxuriant
vegetation
is
the
consequence
you
have
observed
this
no
doubt
in
travelling
down
the
river
and
such
was
the
case
in
the
old
spanish
settlements
on
the
gila
but
why
were
these
abandoned
i
inquired
never
having
heard
any
reason
assigned
for
the
desertion
of
these
once
flourishing
colonies
why
echoed
seguin
with
a
peculiar
energy
why
unless
some
other
race
than
the
iberian
take
possession
of
these
lands
the
apache
the
navajo
and
the
comanche
the
conquered
of
cortez
and
his
conquerors
will
yet
drive
the
descendants
of
those
very
conquerors
from
the
soil
of
mexico
look
at
sonora
and
chihuahua
look
at
new
mexico
its
citizens
living
by
suffrance
living
as
it
were
to
till
the
land
and
feed
the
flocks
for
the
support
of
their
own
enemies
who
levy
their
blackmail
by
the
year
but
come
the
sun
tells
us
we
must
on
come
mount
we
can
go
through
continued
he
there
has
been
no
rain
lately
and
the
water
is
low
otherwise
we
should
have
fifteen
miles
of
a
ride
over
the
mountain
yonder
keep
close
to
the
rocks
follow
me
and
with
this
admonition
he
entered
the
canon
followed
by
myself
gode
and
the
doctor
chapter
nineteen
the
it
was
still
early
in
the
evening
when
we
reached
the
camp
the
camp
of
the
our
arrival
was
scarcely
noticed
a
single
glance
at
us
as
we
rode
in
amongst
the
men
was
all
the
recognition
we
received
no
one
rose
from
his
seat
or
ceased
his
occupation
we
were
left
to
unsaddle
our
horses
and
dispose
of
them
as
best
we
might
i
was
wearied
with
the
ride
having
been
so
long
unused
to
the
saddle
i
threw
my
blanket
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
resting
my
back
against
the
stump
of
a
tree
i
could
have
slept
but
the
strangeness
of
everything
around
me
excited
my
imagination
and
with
feelings
of
curiosity
i
looked
and
listened
i
should
call
the
pencil
to
my
aid
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
scene
and
that
would
but
faintly
illustrate
it
a
wilder
and
more
picturesque
never
impressed
human
vision
it
reminded
me
of
pictures
i
had
seen
representing
the
bivouacs
of
brigands
under
the
dark
pines
of
the
abruzzi
i
paint
from
a
recollection
that
looks
back
over
many
years
of
adventurous
life
i
can
give
only
the
more
salient
points
of
the
picture
the
is
forgotten
although
at
that
time
the
minutest
objects
were
things
new
and
strange
to
my
eye
and
each
of
them
for
a
while
fixed
my
attention
i
afterwards
grew
familiar
with
them
and
hence
they
are
now
in
my
memory
as
a
multitude
of
other
things
indistinct
from
their
very
distinctness
the
camp
was
in
a
bend
of
the
del
norte
in
a
glade
surrounded
by
tall
whose
smooth
trunks
rose
vertically
out
of
a
thick
underwood
of
palmettoes
and
spanish
bayonet
a
few
tattered
tents
stood
in
the
open
ground
and
there
were
skin
lodges
after
the
indian
fashion
but
most
of
the
hunters
had
made
their
shelter
with
a
stretched
upon
four
upright
poles
there
were
lairs
among
the
underwood
constructed
of
branches
and
thatched
with
the
palmated
leaves
of
the
yucca
or
with
reeds
brought
from
the
adjacent
river
there
were
paths
leading
out
in
different
directions
marked
by
openings
in
the
foliage
through
one
of
these
a
green
meadow
was
visible
mules
and
mustangs
picketed
on
long
were
clustered
over
it
through
the
camp
were
seen
the
saddles
bridles
and
packs
resting
upon
stumps
or
hanging
from
the
branches
guns
leaned
against
the
trees
and
rusted
sabres
hung
suspended
over
the
tents
and
lodges
articles
of
camp
furniture
such
as
pans
kettles
and
axes
littered
the
ground
in
every
direction
log
fires
were
burning
around
them
sat
clusters
of
men
they
were
not
seeking
warmth
for
it
was
not
cold
they
were
roasting
ribs
of
venison
or
smoking
pipes
some
were
scouring
their
arms
and
accoutrements
the
accents
of
many
languages
fell
upon
my
ear
i
heard
snatches
of
french
spanish
english
and
indian
the
exclamations
were
in
character
with
the
appearance
of
those
who
uttered
them
hollo
dick
hang
it
old
hoss
what
are
ye
carambo
by
the
airthquake
vaya
hombre
vaya
carrajo
by
gosh
santisima
maria
it
seemed
as
if
the
different
nations
had
sent
representatives
to
contest
the
supremacy
of
their
shibboleths
i
was
struck
with
three
groups
a
particular
language
prevailed
in
each
and
there
was
a
homogeneousness
about
the
costumes
of
the
men
composing
each
that
nearest
me
conversed
in
the
spanish
language
they
were
mexicans
i
will
describe
the
dress
of
one
as
i
remember
it
calzoneros
of
green
velvet
these
are
cut
after
the
fashion
of
short
waist
tight
round
the
hips
and
wide
at
the
bottoms
where
they
are
strengthened
by
black
leather
stamped
and
stitched
ornamentally
the
outer
seams
are
split
from
hip
to
thigh
slashed
with
braid
and
set
with
rows
of
silver
castletops
these
seams
are
open
for
the
evening
is
warm
and
underneath
appear
the
calzoncillos
of
white
muslin
hanging
in
white
folds
around
the
ankles
the
boot
is
of
tanned
but
not
blackened
it
is
reddish
rounded
at
the
toe
and
carries
a
spur
at
least
a
pound
in
weight
with
a
rowel
three
inches
in
diameter
the
spur
is
curiously
fashioned
and
fastened
to
the
boot
by
straps
of
stamped
leather
little
bells
campanulas
hang
from
the
teeth
of
the
rowels
and
tinkle
at
the
slightest
motion
of
the
foot
look
upward
the
calzoneros
are
not
braced
but
fastened
at
the
waist
by
a
silken
sash
or
scarf
it
is
scarlet
it
is
passed
several
times
round
the
body
and
made
fast
behind
where
the
fringed
ends
hang
gracefully
over
the
left
hip
there
is
no
waistcoat
a
jacket
of
dark
cloth
embroidered
and
tightly
fitting
short
behind
la
leaving
the
shirt
to
puff
out
over
the
scarf
the
shirt
itself
with
its
broad
collar
and
flowered
front
exhibits
the
triumphant
skill
of
some
poblana
over
all
this
is
the
shadowy
sombrero
a
heavy
hat
of
black
glaze
with
its
thick
band
of
silver
bullion
there
are
tags
of
the
same
metal
stuck
in
the
sides
giving
it
an
appearance
altogether
unique
over
one
shoulder
is
hanging
the
picturesque
serape
a
belt
and
pouch
an
escopette
upon
which
the
hand
is
resting
a
with
a
pair
of
small
pistols
stuck
under
it
a
long
spanish
knife
suspended
obliquely
across
the
left
hip
complete
the
of
him
whom
i
have
chosen
to
describe
it
may
answer
as
a
characteristic
of
the
dress
of
many
of
his
companions
those
of
the
group
that
was
nearest
me
there
was
variety
in
their
habiliments
yet
the
national
costume
of
mexico
was
traceable
in
all
some
wore
leather
calzoneros
with
a
spencer
or
jerkin
of
the
same
material
close
both
at
front
and
behind
some
carried
instead
of
the
pictured
serape
the
blanket
of
the
navajoes
with
its
broad
black
stripes
suspended
from
the
shoulders
of
others
hung
the
beautiful
and
graceful
manga
some
were
moccasined
while
a
few
of
the
inferior
men
wore
the
simple
guarache
the
sandal
of
the
aztecs
the
countenances
of
these
men
were
swarth
and
their
hair
long
straight
and
black
as
the
wing
of
a
crow
while
both
beard
and
moustache
grew
wildly
over
their
faces
fierce
dark
eyes
gleamed
under
the
broad
brims
of
their
hats
few
of
them
were
men
of
high
stature
yet
there
was
a
litheness
in
their
bodies
that
showed
them
to
be
capable
of
great
activity
their
frames
were
well
knit
and
inured
to
fatigues
and
hardships
they
were
all
or
nearly
all
natives
of
the
mexican
border
frontier
men
who
had
often
closed
in
deadly
fight
with
the
indian
foe
they
were
ciboleros
vaqueros
rancheros
monteros
men
who
in
their
frequent
association
with
the
mountain
men
the
gallic
and
saxon
hunters
from
the
eastern
plains
had
acquired
a
degree
of
daring
which
by
no
means
belongs
to
their
own
race
they
were
the
chivalry
of
the
mexican
frontier
they
smoked
cigaritas
rolling
them
between
their
fingers
in
husks
of
maize
they
played
monte
on
their
spread
blankets
staking
their
tobacco
they
cursed
and
cried
carrajo
when
they
lost
and
thanks
to
the
santisima
virgin
when
the
cards
were
pulled
out
in
their
favour
their
language
was
a
spanish
patois
their
voices
were
sharp
and
disagreeable
at
a
short
distance
from
these
was
the
second
group
that
attracted
my
attention
the
individuals
composing
this
were
altogether
different
from
the
former
they
were
different
in
every
essential
point
in
voice
dress
language
and
physiognomy
theirs
was
the
face
at
a
glance
these
were
the
trappers
the
prairie
hunters
the
mountain
men
let
us
again
choose
a
type
that
may
answer
for
a
description
of
all
he
stands
leaning
on
his
long
straight
rifle
looking
into
the
fire
he
is
six
feet
in
his
moccasins
and
of
a
build
that
suggests
the
idea
of
strength
and
saxon
ancestry
his
arms
are
like
young
oaks
and
his
hand
grasping
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
is
large
fleshless
and
muscular
his
cheek
is
broad
and
firm
it
is
partially
covered
by
a
bushy
whisker
that
meets
over
the
chin
and
fringes
all
around
the
lips
it
is
neither
fair
nor
dark
but
of
a
colour
lighter
around
the
mouth
where
it
has
been
bleached
by
the
sun
ambeer
and
water
the
eye
is
grey
or
bluish
grey
small
and
slightly
crowed
at
the
corner
it
is
well
set
and
rarely
wanders
it
seems
to
look
into
you
rather
than
at
you
the
hair
is
brown
and
of
a
medium
length
cut
no
doubt
on
his
last
visit
to
the
trading
post
or
the
settlements
and
the
complexion
although
dark
as
that
of
a
mulatto
is
only
so
from
tan
it
was
once
fair
a
blonde
the
countenance
is
not
unprepossessing
it
might
be
styled
handsome
its
whole
expression
is
bold
but
and
generous
the
dress
of
the
individual
described
is
of
home
manufacture
that
is
of
his
home
the
prairie
and
the
wild
mountain
park
where
the
material
has
been
bought
by
a
bullet
from
his
rifle
it
is
the
work
of
his
own
hands
unless
indeed
he
may
be
one
who
has
shared
his
cabin
with
some
indian
sioux
crow
or
cheyenne
it
consists
of
a
of
dressed
smoked
to
the
softness
of
a
glove
leggings
reaching
to
the
waist
and
moccasins
of
the
same
material
the
latter
soled
with
the
parfleche
of
the
buffalo
the
shirt
is
belted
at
the
waist
but
open
at
the
breast
and
throat
where
it
falls
back
into
a
graceful
cape
just
covering
the
shoulders
underneath
is
seen
the
undershirt
of
finer
material
the
dressed
skin
of
the
antelope
or
the
fawn
of
the
on
his
head
is
a
raccoon
cap
with
the
face
of
the
animal
looking
to
the
front
while
the
barred
tail
hangs
like
a
plume
drooping
down
to
his
left
shoulder
his
accoutrements
are
a
made
from
the
undressed
skin
of
the
mountain
cat
and
a
huge
horn
upon
which
he
has
carved
many
a
strange
souvenir
his
arms
consist
of
a
long
knife
a
bowie
and
a
heavy
pistol
carefully
secured
by
a
holster
to
the
leathern
belt
around
his
waist
add
to
this
a
rifle
nearly
five
feet
long
taking
ninety
to
the
pound
and
so
straight
that
the
line
of
the
barrel
scarcely
deflects
from
that
of
the
butt
but
little
attention
has
been
paid
to
ornament
in
either
his
dress
arms
or
equipments
and
yet
there
is
a
gracefulness
in
the
hang
of
his
shirt
a
stylishness
about
the
fringing
of
the
cape
and
leggings
and
a
jauntiness
in
the
set
of
that
cap
that
shows
the
wearer
to
be
not
altogether
unmindful
of
his
personal
appearance
a
small
pouch
or
case
neatly
embroidered
with
stained
porcupine
quills
hangs
upon
his
breast
at
intervals
he
contemplates
this
with
a
pleased
and
complacent
look
it
is
his
a
from
some
damsel
no
doubt
like
himself
a
denizen
of
the
wild
wilderness
such
is
the
of
a
mountain
trapper
there
were
many
around
him
whom
i
have
described
almost
similarly
attired
and
equipped
some
wore
slouch
hats
of
greyish
felt
and
some
catskin
caps
some
had
bleached
to
a
brighter
hue
and
broidered
with
gayer
colours
others
looked
more
tattered
and
patched
and
smoky
yet
in
the
costume
of
all
there
was
enough
of
character
to
enable
you
to
class
them
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistaking
the
regular
mountain
man
the
third
group
that
attracted
my
attention
was
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
spot
i
occupied
i
was
filled
with
curiosity
not
to
say
astonishment
on
perceiving
that
they
were
indians
can
they
be
prisoners
thought
i
no
they
are
not
bound
there
are
no
signs
of
captivity
either
in
their
looks
or
gestures
and
yet
they
are
indians
can
they
belong
to
the
band
fighting
against
as
i
sat
conjecturing
a
hunter
passed
near
me
who
are
these
indians
i
asked
indicating
the
group
delawares
some
shawnees
these
then
were
the
celebrated
delawares
descendants
of
that
great
tribe
who
on
the
atlantic
shores
first
gave
battle
to
the
invader
theirs
had
been
a
wonderful
history
war
their
school
war
their
worship
war
their
pastime
war
their
profession
they
are
now
but
a
remnant
their
story
will
soon
be
ended
i
rose
up
and
approached
them
with
a
feeling
of
interest
some
of
them
were
sitting
around
the
fire
smoking
out
of
pipes
of
the
red
claystone
others
strode
back
and
forth
with
that
majestic
gait
for
which
the
forest
indian
has
been
so
much
celebrated
there
was
a
silence
among
them
that
contrasted
strangely
with
the
jabbering
kept
up
by
their
mexican
allies
an
occasional
question
put
in
a
sonorous
voice
a
short
but
emphatic
reply
a
guttural
grunt
a
dignified
nod
a
gesture
with
the
hand
and
thus
they
conversed
as
they
filled
their
with
the
and
passed
the
valued
instruments
from
one
to
another
i
stood
gazing
upon
these
stoical
sons
of
the
forest
with
emotions
stronger
than
curiosity
as
one
contemplates
for
the
first
time
an
object
of
which
he
has
heard
and
read
strange
accounts
the
history
of
their
wars
and
their
wanderings
were
fresh
in
my
memory
before
me
were
the
actors
themselves
or
types
of
them
in
all
their
truthful
reality
in
all
their
wild
picturesqueness
these
were
the
men
who
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
atlantic
border
yielded
only
to
fate
to
the
destiny
of
their
race
crossing
the
appalachian
range
they
had
fought
their
way
from
home
to
home
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
alleghany
along
the
wooded
banks
of
the
ohio
into
the
heart
of
the
bloody
ground
still
the
followed
on
their
track
and
drove
them
onward
onward
towards
the
setting
sun
red
wars
punic
faith
broken
treaties
year
after
year
thinned
their
ranks
still
disdaining
to
live
near
their
white
conquerors
they
pushed
on
fighting
their
way
through
tribes
of
their
own
race
and
colour
thrice
their
numbers
the
forks
of
the
osage
became
their
latest
here
the
usurper
promised
to
guarantee
them
a
home
to
be
theirs
to
all
time
the
concession
came
too
late
war
and
wandering
had
grown
to
be
part
of
their
natures
and
with
a
scornful
pride
they
disdained
the
peaceful
tillage
of
the
soil
the
remnant
of
their
tribe
was
collected
on
the
osage
but
in
one
season
it
had
disappeared
the
braves
and
young
men
wandered
away
leaving
only
the
old
the
women
and
the
worthless
in
their
allotted
home
where
have
they
gone
where
are
they
now
he
who
would
find
the
delawares
must
seek
them
on
the
broad
prairies
in
the
mountain
parks
in
the
haunts
of
the
bear
and
the
beaver
the
and
the
buffalo
there
he
may
find
them
in
scattered
bands
leagued
with
their
ancient
enemies
the
whites
or
alone
trapping
hunting
fighting
the
yuta
or
rapaho
the
crow
or
cheyenne
the
navajo
and
the
apache
i
stood
gazing
upon
the
group
with
feelings
of
profound
interest
upon
their
features
and
their
picturesque
habiliments
though
no
two
of
them
were
dressed
exactly
alike
there
was
a
similarity
about
the
dress
of
all
most
of
them
wore
not
made
of
like
those
of
the
whites
but
of
calico
printed
in
bright
patterns
this
dress
handsomely
fashioned
and
fringed
under
the
accoutrements
of
the
indian
warrior
presented
a
striking
appearance
but
that
which
chiefly
distinguished
the
costumes
of
both
the
delaware
and
shawano
from
that
of
their
white
allies
was
the
this
was
in
fact
a
turban
formed
by
binding
the
head
with
a
scarf
or
kerchief
of
a
brilliant
colour
such
as
may
be
seen
on
the
dark
creoles
of
hayti
in
the
group
before
me
no
two
of
these
turbans
were
alike
yet
they
were
all
of
a
similar
character
the
finest
were
those
made
by
the
chequered
kerchiefs
of
madras
plumes
surmounted
them
of
coloured
feathers
from
the
wing
of
the
or
the
blue
plumage
of
the
gruya
for
the
rest
of
their
costume
they
wore
leggings
and
moccasins
nearly
similar
to
those
of
the
trappers
the
leggings
of
some
were
ornamented
by
along
the
outer
seam
exhibiting
a
dark
history
of
the
wearer
prowess
i
noticed
that
their
moccasins
were
peculiar
differing
altogether
from
those
worn
by
the
indians
of
the
prairies
they
were
seamed
up
the
fronts
without
braiding
or
ornament
and
gathered
into
a
double
row
of
plaits
the
arms
and
equipments
of
these
warrior
men
were
like
those
of
the
white
hunters
they
have
long
since
discarded
the
bow
and
in
the
management
of
the
rifle
most
of
them
can
draw
a
bead
and
hit
plumb
centre
with
any
of
their
mountain
associates
in
addition
to
the
firelock
and
knife
i
noticed
that
they
still
carried
the
ancient
weapon
of
their
race
the
fearful
tomahawk
i
have
described
three
characteristic
groups
that
struck
me
on
glancing
over
the
camp
ground
there
were
individuals
belonging
to
neither
and
others
partaking
of
the
character
of
one
or
all
there
were
frenchmen
canadian
voyageurs
strays
of
the
company
wearing
white
capotes
and
chatting
dancing
and
singing
their
with
all
the
of
their
race
there
were
pueblos
indios
manzos
clad
in
their
ungraceful
tilmas
and
rather
serving
than
associating
with
those
around
them
there
were
mulattoes
too
and
negroes
of
a
jetty
blackness
from
the
plantations
of
louisiana
who
had
exchanged
for
this
free
roving
life
the
twisted
of
the
overseer
there
were
tattered
uniforms
showing
the
deserters
who
had
wandered
from
some
frontier
post
into
this
remote
region
there
were
kanakas
from
the
sandwich
isles
who
had
crossed
the
deserts
from
california
there
were
men
apparently
of
every
hue
and
clime
and
tongue
here
assembled
drawn
together
by
the
accidents
of
life
by
the
instinct
of
adventure
all
more
or
less
strange
individuals
of
the
strangest
band
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
witness
the
band
of
the
chapter
twenty
i
had
returned
to
my
blanket
and
was
about
to
stretch
myself
upon
it
when
the
whoop
of
a
gruya
drew
my
attention
looking
up
i
saw
one
of
these
birds
flying
towards
the
camp
it
was
coming
through
a
break
in
the
trees
that
opened
from
the
river
it
flew
low
and
tempted
a
shot
with
its
broad
wings
and
slow
lazy
flight
a
report
rang
upon
the
air
one
of
the
mexicans
had
fired
his
escopette
but
the
bird
flew
on
plying
its
wings
with
more
energy
as
if
to
bear
itself
out
of
reach
there
was
a
laugh
from
the
trappers
and
a
voice
cried
out
yur
fool
think
kud
hit
a
spread
blanket
wi
that
blunderbox
pish
i
turned
to
see
who
had
delivered
this
odd
speech
two
men
were
poising
their
rifles
bringing
them
to
bear
upon
the
bird
one
was
the
young
hunter
whom
i
have
described
the
other
was
an
indian
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
the
cracks
were
simultaneous
and
the
crane
dropping
its
long
neck
came
whirling
down
among
the
trees
where
it
caught
upon
a
high
branch
and
remained
from
their
position
neither
party
knew
that
the
other
had
fired
a
tent
was
between
them
and
the
two
reports
had
seemed
as
one
a
trapper
cried
out
well
done
garey
lord
help
the
thing
that
afore
old
muzzle
when
you
squints
through
her
the
indian
just
then
stepped
round
the
tent
hearing
this
side
speech
and
perceiving
the
smoke
still
oozing
from
the
muzzle
of
the
young
hunter
gun
he
turned
to
the
latter
with
the
interrogation
did
you
fire
sir
this
was
said
in
and
most
english
which
would
have
drawn
my
attention
to
the
man
had
not
his
appearance
riveted
me
already
who
is
he
i
inquired
from
one
near
me
do
know
fresh
arriv
was
the
short
answer
do
you
mean
that
he
is
a
stranger
here
just
so
he
kumb
in
thar
a
while
agone
do
anybody
knows
him
i
guess
the
captain
does
i
seed
them
shake
hands
i
looked
at
the
indian
with
increasing
interest
he
seemed
a
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
not
much
under
seven
feet
in
height
he
was
proportioned
like
an
apollo
and
on
this
account
appeared
smaller
than
he
actually
was
his
features
were
of
the
roman
type
and
his
fine
forehead
his
aquiline
nose
and
broad
jawbone
gave
him
the
appearance
of
talent
as
well
as
firmness
and
energy
he
was
dressed
in
a
leggings
and
moccasins
but
all
these
differed
from
anything
worn
either
by
the
hunters
or
their
indian
allies
the
shirt
itself
was
made
out
of
the
dressed
hide
of
the
red
deer
but
differently
prepared
from
that
used
by
the
trappers
it
was
bleached
almost
to
the
whiteness
of
a
kid
glove
the
breast
unlike
theirs
was
close
and
beautifully
embroidered
with
stained
porcupine
quills
the
sleeves
were
similarly
ornamented
and
the
cape
and
skirts
were
trimmed
with
the
soft
fur
of
the
ermine
a
row
of
entire
skins
of
that
animal
hung
from
the
skirt
border
forming
a
fringe
both
graceful
and
costly
but
the
most
singular
feature
about
this
man
was
his
hair
it
fell
loosely
over
his
shoulders
and
swept
the
ground
as
he
walked
it
could
not
have
been
less
than
seven
feet
in
length
it
was
black
glossy
and
luxuriant
and
reminded
me
of
the
tails
of
those
great
flemish
horses
i
had
seen
in
the
funeral
carriages
of
london
he
wore
upon
his
head
the
bonnet
with
its
full
circle
of
plumes
the
finest
triumph
of
savage
taste
this
magnificent
added
to
the
majesty
of
his
appearance
a
white
buffalo
robe
hung
from
his
shoulders
with
all
the
graceful
draping
of
a
toga
its
silky
fur
corresponded
to
the
colour
of
his
dress
and
contrasted
strikingly
with
his
own
dark
tresses
there
were
other
ornaments
about
his
person
his
arms
and
accoutrements
were
shining
with
metallic
brightness
and
the
stock
and
butt
of
his
rifle
were
richly
inlaid
with
silver
i
have
been
thus
minute
in
my
description
as
the
first
appearance
of
this
man
impressed
me
with
a
picture
that
can
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
he
was
the
of
a
picturesque
and
romantic
savage
and
yet
there
was
nothing
savage
either
in
his
speech
or
bearing
on
the
contrary
the
interrogation
which
he
had
just
addressed
to
the
trapper
was
put
in
the
politest
manner
the
reply
was
not
so
courteous
did
i
fire
did
ye
hear
a
crack
did
ye
see
the
thing
fall
look
yonder
garey
as
he
spoke
pointed
up
to
the
bird
we
must
have
fired
simultaneously
as
the
indian
said
this
he
appealed
to
his
gun
which
was
still
smoking
at
the
muzzle
look
hyar
injun
whether
we
fired
symultainyously
or
extraneously
or
cattawampously
ai
the
flappin
o
a
beaver
tail
to
me
but
i
tuk
sight
on
that
bird
i
hut
that
bird
and
my
bullet
brought
the
thing
down
i
think
i
must
have
hit
it
too
replied
the
indian
modestly
that
like
with
that
ar
spangled
gimcrack
said
garey
looking
disdainfully
at
the
other
gun
and
then
proudly
at
his
own
brown
piece
which
he
had
just
wiped
and
was
about
to
reload
gimcrack
or
no
answered
the
indian
she
sends
a
bullet
straighter
and
farther
than
any
piece
i
have
hitherto
met
with
i
warrant
she
has
sent
hers
through
the
body
of
the
crane
look
hyar
mister
for
i
we
must
call
a
gentleman
who
speaks
so
fine
an
looks
so
fine
tho
he
be
an
injun
it
mighty
easy
to
settle
who
hut
the
bird
that
thing
a
fifty
or
tharabouts
killbar
a
ninety
hard
to
tell
which
has
plugged
the
varmint
we
soon
see
and
so
saying
the
hunter
stepped
off
towards
the
tree
on
which
hung
the
gruya
high
up
how
are
you
to
get
it
down
cried
one
of
the
men
who
had
stepped
forward
to
witness
the
settlement
of
this
curious
dispute
there
was
no
reply
for
everyone
saw
that
garey
was
poising
his
rifle
for
a
shot
the
crack
followed
and
the
branch
shivered
by
his
bullet
bent
downward
under
the
weight
of
the
gruya
but
the
bird
caught
in
a
double
fork
still
stuck
fast
on
the
broken
limb
a
murmur
of
approbation
followed
the
shot
these
were
men
not
accustomed
to
hurrah
loudly
at
a
trivial
incident
the
indian
now
approached
having
reloaded
his
piece
taking
aim
he
struck
the
branch
at
the
shattered
point
cutting
it
clean
from
the
tree
the
bird
fell
to
the
ground
amidst
expressions
of
applause
from
the
spectators
but
chiefly
from
the
mexican
and
indian
hunters
it
was
at
once
picked
up
and
examined
two
bullets
had
passed
through
its
body
either
would
have
killed
it
a
shadow
of
unpleasant
feeling
was
visible
on
the
face
of
the
young
trapper
in
the
presence
of
so
many
hunters
of
every
nation
to
be
thus
equalled
beaten
in
the
in
of
his
favourite
weapon
and
by
an
injun
still
worse
by
one
of
them
ar
gingerbread
guns
the
mountain
men
have
no
faith
in
an
ornamented
stock
or
a
big
bore
spangled
rifles
they
say
are
like
spangled
razors
made
for
selling
to
greenhorns
it
was
evident
however
that
the
strange
indian
rifle
had
been
made
to
shoot
as
well
it
required
all
the
strength
of
nerve
which
the
trapper
possessed
to
conceal
his
chagrin
without
saying
a
word
he
commenced
wiping
out
his
gun
with
that
stoical
calmness
peculiar
to
men
of
his
calling
i
observed
that
he
proceeded
to
load
with
more
than
usual
care
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
rest
satisfied
with
the
trial
already
made
but
would
either
beat
the
injun
or
be
himself
whipped
into
shucks
so
he
declared
in
a
muttered
speech
to
his
comrades
his
piece
was
soon
loaded
and
swinging
her
to
the
hunter
carry
he
turned
to
the
crowd
now
collected
from
all
parts
of
the
camp
thar
one
kind
o
shootin
said
he
that
jest
as
easy
as
off
a
log
any
man
kin
do
it
as
kin
look
straight
through
but
then
thar
another
kind
that
ai
so
easy
it
needs
narve
here
the
trapper
paused
and
looked
towards
the
indian
who
was
also
reloading
look
hyar
stranger
continued
he
addressing
the
latter
have
ye
got
a
cummarade
on
the
ground
as
knows
yer
shooting
the
indian
after
a
moment
hesitation
answered
yes
kin
your
cummarade
depend
on
yer
shot
oh
i
think
so
why
do
you
wish
to
know
that
why
i
to
show
ye
a
shot
we
sometimes
practise
at
fort
jest
to
tickle
the
greenhorns
much
of
a
shot
nayther
but
it
tries
the
narves
a
little
i
reckon
hoy
rube
what
doo
want
this
was
spoken
in
an
energetic
and
voice
that
turned
all
eyes
to
the
quarter
whence
it
proceeded
at
the
first
glance
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
in
that
direction
in
looking
more
carefully
among
the
logs
and
stumps
an
individual
was
discovered
seated
by
one
of
the
fires
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
tell
that
it
was
a
human
body
had
not
the
arms
at
the
moment
been
in
motion
the
back
was
turned
toward
the
crowd
and
the
head
had
disappeared
sunk
forward
over
the
fire
the
object
from
where
we
were
standing
looked
more
like
the
stump
of
a
dressed
in
buckskin
than
the
body
of
a
human
being
on
getting
nearer
and
round
to
the
front
of
it
it
was
seen
to
be
a
man
though
a
very
curious
one
holding
a
long
rib
of
in
both
hands
which
he
was
polishing
with
a
very
poor
set
of
teeth
the
whole
appearance
of
this
individual
was
odd
and
striking
his
dress
if
dress
it
could
be
called
was
simple
as
it
was
savage
it
consisted
of
what
might
have
once
been
a
but
which
now
looked
more
like
a
leathern
bag
with
the
bottom
ripped
open
and
the
sleeves
sewed
into
the
sides
it
was
of
a
colour
wrinkled
at
the
hollow
of
the
arms
patched
round
the
armpits
and
greasy
all
over
it
was
fairly
caked
with
dirt
there
was
no
attempt
at
either
ornament
or
fringe
there
had
been
a
cape
but
this
had
evidently
been
drawn
upon
from
time
to
time
for
patches
and
other
uses
until
scarcely
a
vestige
of
it
remained
the
leggings
and
moccasins
were
on
a
par
with
the
shirt
and
seemed
to
have
been
manufactured
out
of
the
same
hide
they
too
were
patched
wrinkled
and
greasy
they
did
not
meet
each
other
but
left
a
piece
of
the
ankle
bare
and
that
also
was
like
the
there
was
no
undershirt
waistcoat
or
other
garment
to
be
seen
with
the
exception
of
a
cap
which
had
once
been
but
the
hair
was
all
worn
off
it
leaving
a
greasy
surface
that
corresponded
well
with
the
other
parts
of
the
dress
cap
shirt
leggings
and
moccasins
looked
as
if
they
had
never
been
stripped
off
since
the
day
they
were
first
tried
on
and
that
might
have
been
many
a
year
ago
the
shirt
was
open
displaying
the
naked
breast
and
throat
and
these
as
well
as
the
face
hands
and
ankles
had
been
tanned
by
the
sun
and
smoked
by
the
fire
to
the
hue
of
rusty
copper
the
whole
man
clothes
and
all
looked
as
if
he
had
been
smoked
on
purpose
his
face
bespoke
a
man
of
sixty
the
features
were
sharp
and
somewhat
aquiline
and
the
small
eye
was
dark
quick
and
piercing
his
hair
was
black
and
cut
short
his
complexion
had
been
naturally
brunette
though
there
was
nothing
of
the
frenchman
or
spaniard
on
his
physiognomy
he
was
more
likely
of
the
black
saxon
breed
as
i
looked
at
this
man
for
i
had
walked
towards
him
prompted
by
some
instinct
of
curiosity
i
began
to
fancy
that
there
was
a
strangeness
about
him
independent
of
the
oddness
of
his
attire
there
seemed
to
be
something
peculiar
about
his
head
something
wanting
what
was
it
i
was
not
long
in
conjecture
when
fairly
in
front
of
him
i
saw
what
was
wanting
it
was
his
ears
this
discovery
impressed
me
with
a
feeling
akin
to
awe
there
is
something
awful
in
a
man
without
ears
it
suggests
some
horrid
drama
some
terrible
scene
of
cruel
vengeance
it
suggests
the
idea
of
crime
committed
and
punishment
inflicted
these
thoughts
were
wandering
through
my
mind
when
all
at
once
i
remembered
a
remark
which
seguin
had
made
on
the
previous
night
this
then
thought
i
is
the
person
of
whom
he
spoke
my
mind
was
satisfied
after
making
answer
as
above
the
old
fellow
sat
for
some
time
with
his
head
between
his
knees
chewing
mumbling
and
growling
like
a
lean
old
wolf
angry
at
being
disturbed
in
his
meal
come
hyar
rube
i
want
ye
a
bit
continued
garey
in
a
tone
of
half
entreaty
and
so
will
want
me
a
bit
this
child
do
move
a
peg
till
he
has
cleaned
this
hyur
rib
he
do
now
it
man
make
haste
then
and
the
impatient
trapper
dropped
the
butt
of
his
rifle
to
the
ground
and
stood
waiting
in
sullen
silence
after
chewing
and
mumbling
and
growling
a
few
minutes
longer
old
rube
for
that
was
the
name
by
which
the
leathery
sinner
was
known
slowly
erected
his
lean
carcass
and
came
walking
up
to
the
crowd
what
do
want
billee
he
inquired
going
up
to
the
trapper
i
want
ye
to
hold
this
answered
garey
offering
him
a
round
white
shell
about
the
size
of
a
watch
a
species
of
which
there
were
many
strewed
over
the
ground
it
a
bet
boyee
no
it
is
not
ai
wastin
yur
powder
ar
yur
i
been
beat
shootin
replied
the
trapper
in
an
undertone
by
that
injun
the
old
man
looked
over
to
where
the
strange
indian
was
standing
erect
and
majestic
in
all
the
pride
of
his
plumage
there
was
no
appearance
of
triumph
or
swagger
about
him
as
he
stood
leaning
on
his
rifle
in
an
attitude
at
once
calm
and
dignified
it
was
plain
from
the
way
old
rube
surveyed
him
that
he
had
seen
him
before
though
not
in
that
camp
after
passing
his
eyes
over
him
from
head
to
foot
and
there
resting
them
a
moment
a
low
murmur
escaped
his
lips
which
ended
abruptly
in
the
word
coco
a
coco
do
ye
think
inquired
the
other
with
an
apparent
interest
are
blind
billee
do
see
his
moccasin
yes
you
right
but
i
was
in
thar
nation
two
years
ago
i
seed
no
such
man
as
that
he
there
whar
then
whur
thur
no
great
show
o
redskins
he
may
shoot
well
he
did
oncest
on
a
time
plumb
centre
you
knew
him
did
ye
oncest
putty
squaw
hansum
gal
whur
do
want
me
to
go
i
thought
that
garey
seemed
inclined
to
carry
the
conversation
further
there
was
an
evident
interest
in
his
manner
when
the
other
mentioned
the
squaw
perhaps
he
had
some
tender
recollection
but
seeing
the
other
preparing
to
start
off
he
pointed
to
an
open
glade
that
stretched
eastward
and
simply
answered
sixty
take
care
o
my
claws
hear
them
injuns
has
made
scarce
this
child
ca
spare
another
the
old
trapper
said
this
with
a
flourish
of
his
right
hand
i
noticed
that
the
little
finger
had
been
chopped
off
never
fear
old
hoss
was
the
reply
and
at
this
the
smoky
carcase
moved
away
with
a
slow
and
regular
pace
that
showed
he
was
measuring
the
yards
when
he
had
stepped
the
sixtieth
yard
he
faced
about
and
stood
erect
placing
his
heels
together
he
then
extended
his
right
arm
raising
it
until
his
hand
was
on
a
level
with
his
shoulder
and
holding
the
shell
in
his
fingers
flat
side
to
the
front
shouted
back
now
billee
shoot
and
be
hanged
to
yur
the
shell
was
slightly
concave
the
concavity
turned
to
the
front
the
thumb
and
finger
reached
half
round
the
circumference
so
that
a
part
of
the
edge
was
hidden
and
the
surface
turned
towards
the
marksman
was
not
larger
than
the
dial
of
a
common
watch
this
was
a
fearful
sight
it
is
one
not
so
common
among
the
mountain
men
as
travellers
would
have
you
believe
the
feat
proves
the
marksman
skill
first
if
successful
by
showing
the
strength
and
steadiness
of
his
nerves
secondly
by
the
confidence
which
the
other
reposes
in
it
thus
declared
by
stronger
testimony
than
any
oath
in
any
case
the
feat
of
holding
the
mark
is
at
least
equal
to
that
of
hitting
it
there
are
many
hunters
willing
to
risk
taking
the
shot
but
few
who
care
to
hold
the
shell
it
was
a
fearful
sight
and
my
nerves
tingled
as
i
looked
on
many
others
felt
as
i
no
one
interfered
there
were
few
present
who
would
have
dared
even
had
these
two
men
been
making
preparations
to
fire
at
each
other
both
were
men
of
mark
among
their
comrades
trappers
of
the
first
class
garey
drawing
a
long
breath
planted
himself
firmly
the
heel
of
his
left
foot
opposite
to
and
some
inches
in
advance
of
the
hollow
of
his
right
then
jerking
up
his
gun
and
throwing
the
barrel
across
his
left
palm
he
cried
out
to
his
comrade
steady
ole
bone
an
sinyer
hyar
at
ye
the
words
were
scarcely
out
when
the
gun
was
levelled
there
was
a
moment
silence
all
eyes
looking
to
the
mark
then
came
the
crack
and
the
shell
was
seen
to
fly
shivered
into
fifty
fragments
there
was
a
cheer
from
the
crowd
old
rube
stopped
to
pick
up
one
of
the
pieces
and
after
examining
it
for
a
moment
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
plumb
centre
by
the
young
trapper
had
in
effect
hit
the
mark
in
the
very
centre
as
the
blue
stain
of
the
bullet
testified
chapter
twenty
one
a
feat
a
la
tell
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
strange
indian
during
the
scene
described
he
has
stood
silent
and
calmly
looking
on
his
eye
now
wanders
over
the
ground
apparently
in
search
of
an
object
a
small
convolvulus
known
as
the
prairie
gourd
is
lying
at
his
feet
it
is
about
the
size
of
an
orange
and
not
unlike
one
in
colour
he
stoops
and
takes
it
up
he
seems
to
examine
it
with
great
care
balancing
it
upon
his
hand
as
though
he
were
calculating
its
weight
what
does
he
intend
to
do
with
this
will
he
fling
it
up
and
send
his
bullet
through
it
in
the
air
what
else
his
motions
are
watched
in
silence
nearly
all
the
sixty
or
seventy
are
on
the
ground
seguin
only
with
the
doctor
and
a
few
men
is
engaged
some
distance
off
pitching
a
tent
garey
stands
upon
one
side
slightly
elated
with
his
triumph
but
not
without
feelings
of
apprehension
that
he
may
yet
be
beaten
old
rube
has
gone
back
to
the
fire
and
is
roasting
another
rib
the
gourd
seems
to
satisfy
the
indian
for
whatever
purpose
he
intends
it
a
long
piece
of
bone
the
thigh
joint
of
the
hangs
suspended
over
his
breast
it
is
curiously
carved
and
pierced
with
holes
like
a
musical
instrument
it
is
one
he
places
this
to
his
lips
covering
the
holes
with
his
fingers
he
sounds
three
notes
oddly
inflected
but
loud
and
sharp
he
drops
the
instrument
again
and
stands
looking
eastward
into
the
woods
the
eyes
of
all
present
are
bent
in
the
same
direction
the
hunters
influenced
by
a
mysterious
curiosity
remain
silent
or
speak
only
in
low
mutterings
like
an
echo
the
three
notes
are
answered
by
a
similar
signal
it
is
evident
that
the
indian
has
a
comrade
in
the
woods
yet
not
one
of
the
band
seems
to
know
aught
of
him
or
his
comrade
yes
one
does
it
is
rube
hyur
boyees
cries
he
squinting
over
his
shoulders
stake
this
rib
against
a
griskin
o
poor
bull
that
see
the
puttiest
gal
as
ever
set
yur
eyes
on
there
is
no
reply
we
are
gazing
too
intently
for
the
expected
arrival
a
rustling
is
heard
as
of
someone
parting
the
bushes
the
tread
of
a
light
foot
the
snapping
of
twigs
a
bright
object
appears
among
the
leaves
someone
is
coming
through
the
underwood
it
is
a
woman
it
is
an
indian
girl
attired
in
a
singular
and
picturesque
costume
she
steps
out
of
the
bushes
and
comes
boldly
towards
the
crowd
all
eyes
are
turned
upon
her
with
looks
of
wonder
and
admiration
we
scan
her
face
and
figure
and
her
striking
attire
she
is
dressed
not
unlike
the
indian
himself
and
there
is
resemblance
in
other
respects
the
tunic
worn
by
the
girl
is
of
finer
materials
of
it
is
richly
trimmed
and
worked
with
split
quills
stained
to
a
variety
of
bright
colours
it
hangs
to
the
middle
of
the
thighs
ending
in
a
of
shells
that
tinkle
as
she
moves
her
limbs
are
wrapped
in
leggings
of
scarlet
cloth
fringed
like
the
tunic
and
reaching
to
the
ankles
where
they
meet
the
flaps
of
her
moccasins
these
last
are
white
embroidered
with
stained
quills
and
fitting
closely
to
her
small
feet
a
belt
of
wampum
closes
the
tunic
on
her
waist
exhibiting
the
globular
developments
of
a
bosom
and
the
undulating
outlines
of
a
womanly
person
her
headdress
is
similar
to
that
worn
by
her
companion
but
smaller
and
lighter
and
her
hair
like
his
hangs
loosely
down
reaching
almost
to
the
ground
her
neck
throat
and
part
of
her
bosom
are
nude
and
clustered
over
with
of
various
colours
the
expression
of
her
countenance
is
high
and
noble
her
eye
is
oblique
the
lips
meet
with
a
double
curve
and
the
throat
is
full
and
rounded
her
complexion
is
indian
but
a
crimson
hue
struggling
through
the
brown
upon
her
cheek
gives
that
pictured
expression
to
her
countenance
which
may
be
observed
in
the
quadroon
of
the
west
indies
she
is
a
girl
though
and
boldly
developed
a
type
of
health
and
savage
beauty
as
she
approaches
the
men
murmur
their
admiration
there
are
hearts
beating
under
that
rarely
deign
to
dream
of
the
charms
of
woman
i
am
struck
at
this
moment
with
the
appearance
of
the
young
trapper
garey
his
face
has
fallen
the
blood
has
forsaken
his
cheeks
his
lips
are
white
and
compressed
and
dark
rings
have
formed
round
his
eyes
they
express
anger
but
there
is
still
another
meaning
in
them
is
it
jealousy
yes
he
has
stepped
behind
one
of
his
comrades
as
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
one
hand
is
playing
involuntarily
with
the
handle
of
his
knife
the
other
grasps
the
barrel
of
his
gun
as
though
he
would
crush
it
between
his
fingers
the
girl
comes
up
the
indian
hands
her
the
gourd
muttering
some
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
unknown
at
least
to
me
she
takes
it
without
making
any
reply
and
walks
off
towards
the
spot
where
rube
had
stood
which
has
been
pointed
out
to
her
by
her
companion
she
reaches
the
tree
and
halts
in
front
of
it
facing
round
as
the
trapper
had
done
there
was
something
so
dramatic
so
theatrical
in
the
whole
proceeding
that
up
to
the
present
time
we
had
all
stood
waiting
for
the
in
silence
now
we
knew
what
it
was
to
be
and
the
men
began
to
talk
he
to
shoot
the
gourd
from
the
hand
of
the
gal
suggested
a
hunter
no
great
shot
after
all
added
another
and
indeed
this
was
the
silent
opinion
of
most
on
the
ground
wagh
it
do
beat
garey
if
he
diz
hit
it
exclaimed
a
third
what
was
our
amazement
at
seeing
the
girl
fling
off
her
plumed
bonnet
place
the
gourd
upon
her
head
fold
her
arms
over
her
bosom
and
standing
fronting
us
as
calm
and
immobile
as
if
she
had
been
carved
upon
the
tree
there
was
a
murmur
in
the
crowd
the
indian
was
raising
his
rifle
to
take
aim
when
a
man
rushed
forward
to
prevent
him
it
was
garey
no
yer
do
no
cried
he
clutching
the
levelled
rifle
deceived
me
that
plain
but
i
wo
see
the
gal
that
once
loved
me
or
said
she
did
in
the
trap
that
no
bill
garey
ai
to
stand
by
and
see
it
what
is
this
shouted
the
indian
in
a
voice
of
thunder
who
dares
to
interrupt
me
i
dares
replied
garey
she
yourn
now
i
suppose
you
may
take
her
whar
ye
like
and
take
this
too
continued
he
tearing
off
the
embroidered
and
flinging
it
at
the
indian
feet
but
not
to
shoot
her
down
whiles
i
stand
by
by
what
right
do
you
interrupt
me
my
sister
is
not
afraid
and
your
sister
yes
my
sister
and
is
yon
gal
your
sister
eagerly
inquired
garey
his
manner
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
all
at
once
changing
she
is
i
have
said
she
is
and
are
you
el
sol

ask
your

risk
i
will
show
you

no
if
you
must
then
let
me
i
will
hold
it
oh
let

stammered
the
hunter
in
tones
of
entreaty
hollo
billee
what
the
dratted
rumpus
cried
rube
coming
up
hang
it
man
let
see
the
shot
i
heern
o
it
afore
do
be
skeert
ye
fool
he
do
it
like
a
breeze
he
will
and
as
the
old
trapper
said
this
he
caught
his
comrade
by
the
arm
and
swung
him
round
out
of
the
indian
way
the
girl
during
all
this
had
stood
still
seemingly
not
knowing
the
cause
of
the
interruption
garey
back
was
turned
to
her
and
the
distance
with
two
years
of
separation
doubtless
prevented
her
from
recognising
him
before
garey
could
turn
to
interpose
himself
the
rifle
was
at
the
indian
shoulder
and
levelled
his
finger
was
on
the
trigger
and
his
eyes
glanced
through
the
sights
it
was
too
late
to
interfere
any
attempt
at
that
might
bring
about
the
dreaded
result
the
hunter
as
he
turned
saw
this
and
halting
in
his
tracks
stood
straining
and
silent
it
was
a
moment
of
terrible
suspense
to
all
of
us
a
moment
of
intense
emotion
the
silence
was
profound
every
breath
seemed
suspended
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
yellow
object
not
larger
i
have
said
than
an
orange
oh
god
will
the
shot
never
come
it
came
the
flash
the
crack
the
stream
of
fire
the
wild
hurrah
the
forward
rush
were
all
simultaneous
things
we
saw
the
shivered
globe
fly
off
the
girl
was
still
upon
her
feet
she
was
safe
i
ran
with
the
rest
the
smoke
for
a
moment
blinded
me
i
heard
the
shrill
notes
of
the
indian
whistle
i
looked
before
me
the
girl
had
disappeared
we
ran
to
the
spot
where
she
had
stood
we
heard
a
rustling
in
the
underwood
a
departing
footstep
we
knew
it
was
she
but
guided
by
an
instinct
of
delicacy
and
a
knowledge
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
wish
of
her
brother
no
one
followed
her
we
found
the
fragments
of
the
calabash
strewed
over
the
ground
we
found
the
leaden
mark
upon
them
the
bullet
itself
was
buried
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
and
one
of
the
hunters
commenced
digging
it
out
with
the
point
of
his
bowie
when
we
turned
to
go
back
we
saw
that
the
indian
had
walked
away
and
now
stood
chatting
easily
and
familiarly
with
seguin
as
we
the
i
observed
garey
stoop
and
pick
up
a
shining
object
it
was
the
which
he
carefully
readjusted
around
his
neck
in
its
wonted
position
from
his
look
and
the
manner
in
which
he
handled
it
it
was
plain
that
he
now
regarded
that
souvenir
with
more
reverence
than
ever
chapter
twenty
two
a
feat
a
la
tail
i
had
fallen
into
a
sort
of
reverie
my
mind
was
occupied
with
the
incidents
i
had
just
witnessed
when
a
voice
which
i
recognised
as
that
of
old
rube
roused
me
from
my
abstraction
hyur
boyees
tai
as
ole
rube
wastes
lead
but
beat
that
injun
shot
or
may
cut
my
ears
off
a
loud
laugh
hailed
this
allusion
of
the
trapper
to
his
ears
which
as
we
have
observed
were
already
gone
and
so
closely
had
they
been
trimmed
that
nothing
remained
for
either
knife
or
shears
to
accomplish
how
will
you
do
it
rube
cried
one
of
the
hunters
shoot
the
mark
off
a
yer
own
head
i
let
see
if
wait
replied
rube
stalking
up
to
a
tree
and
taking
from
its
rest
a
long
heavy
rifle
which
he
proceeded
to
wipe
out
with
care
the
attention
of
all
was
now
turned
to
the
manoeuvres
of
the
old
trapper
conjecture
was
busy
as
to
his
designs
what
feat
could
he
perform
that
would
eclipse
the
one
just
witnessed
no
one
could
guess
i
beat
it
continued
he
muttering
as
he
loaded
his
piece
or
may
chop
the
little
finger
off
ole
rube
right
paw
another
peal
of
laughter
followed
as
all
perceived
that
this
was
the
finger
that
was
wanting
es
continued
he
looking
at
the
faces
that
were
around
him
may
scalp
me
if
i
do
this
last
remark
elicited
fresh
roars
of
laughter
for
although
the
was
closely
drawn
upon
his
head
all
present
knew
that
old
rube
was
minus
his
scalp
but
how
are
ye
goin
to
do
it
tell
us
that
old
hoss
see
this
do
asked
the
trapper
holding
out
a
small
fruit
of
the
cactus
pitahaya
which
he
had
just
plucked
and
cleaned
of
its
spikelets
ay
ay
cried
several
voices
in
reply
do
do
wal
see
half
as
big
as
the
squash
see
that
do
oh
sartinly
any
fool
can
see
that
wal
i
plug
it
at
sixty
plump
centre
wagh
cried
several
with
shrugs
of
disappointment
stick
it
on
a
pole
and
any
o
us
can
do
that
said
the
principal
speaker
here
barney
could
knock
it
off
wid
his
owld
musket
could
you
barney
in
truth
an
i
could
thry
answered
a
very
small
man
leaning
upon
a
musket
and
who
was
dressed
in
a
tattered
uniform
that
had
once
been
i
had
already
noticed
this
individual
with
some
curiosity
partly
struck
with
his
peculiar
costume
but
more
particularly
on
account
of
the
redness
of
his
hair
which
was
the
reddest
i
had
ever
seen
it
bore
the
marks
of
a
severe
barrack
discipline
that
is
it
had
been
shaved
and
was
now
growing
out
of
his
little
round
head
short
and
thick
and
coarse
in
the
grain
and
of
the
colour
of
a
scraped
carrot
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistaking
barney
nationality
in
trapper
phrase
any
fool
could
have
told
that
what
had
brought
such
an
individual
to
such
a
place
i
asked
this
question
and
was
soon
enlightened
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
a
frontier
post
one
of
uncle
sam
he
had
got
tired
of
pork
and
accompanied
with
a
too
liberal
allowance
of
the
hide
in
a
word
barney
was
a
deserter
what
his
name
was
i
know
not
but
he
went
under
the
appellation
of
barney
a
laugh
greeted
his
answer
to
the
hunter
question
any
o
us
continued
the
speaker
could
plug
the
persimmon
that
a
way
but
thar
a
mighty
heap
o
when
you
squints
at
a
girl
like
yon
ye
right
dick
said
another
hunter
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
queery
about
the
jeints
holy
vistment
an
was
she
a
raal
beauty
exclaimed
the
little
irishman
with
an
earnestness
in
his
manner
that
set
the
trappers
roaring
again
pish
cried
rube
who
had
now
finished
loading
yur
a
set
channering
fools
that
what
ur
who
palavered
about
a
post
got
an
ole
squaw
as
well
the
injun
she
hold
the
thing
for
this
child
she
will
squaw
you
a
squaw
yes
hoss
i
has
a
squaw
i
wud
swop
for
two
o
i
make
tracks
an
fetch
the
old
shet
up
yur
heads
an
wait
will
ye
so
saying
the
smoky
old
sinner
shouldered
his
rifle
and
walked
off
into
the
woods
i
in
common
with
others
late
comers
who
were
strangers
to
rube
began
to
think
that
he
had
an
old
there
were
no
females
to
be
seen
about
the
encampment
but
perhaps
she
was
hid
away
in
the
woods
the
trappers
however
who
knew
him
seemed
to
understand
that
the
old
fellow
had
some
trick
in
his
brain
and
that
it
appeared
was
no
new
thing
for
him
we
were
not
kept
long
in
suspense
in
a
few
minutes
rube
was
seen
returning
and
by
his
side
the
old
in
the
shape
of
a
long
lank
mustang
that
turned
out
on
close
inspection
to
be
a
mare
this
then
was
rube
squaw
and
she
was
not
at
all
unlike
him
excepting
the
ears
she
was
in
common
with
all
her
race
the
same
as
that
upon
which
quixote
charged
the
windmill
the
long
ears
caused
her
to
look
mulish
but
it
was
only
in
appearance
she
was
a
pure
mustang
when
you
examined
her
attentively
she
seemed
to
have
been
at
an
earlier
period
of
that
colour
known
as
a
common
colour
among
mexican
horses
but
time
and
scars
had
somewhat
metamorphosed
her
and
grey
hairs
predominated
all
over
particularly
about
the
head
and
neck
these
parts
were
covered
with
a
dirty
grizzle
of
mixed
hues
she
was
badly
and
at
stated
intervals
of
several
minutes
each
her
back
from
the
spasmodic
action
of
the
lungs
heaved
up
with
a
jerk
as
though
she
were
trying
to
kick
with
her
hind
legs
and
could
she
was
as
thin
as
a
rail
and
carried
her
head
below
the
level
of
her
shoulders
but
there
was
something
in
the
twinkle
of
her
solitary
eye
for
she
had
but
one
that
told
you
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
for
a
long
time
to
come
she
was
evidently
game
to
the
backbone
such
was
the
old
rube
had
promised
to
fetch
and
she
was
greeted
by
a
loud
laugh
as
he
led
her
up
now
hyur
boyees
said
he
halting
in
front
of
the
crowd
ee
may
larf
an
gabble
an
grin
till
yur
sick
in
the
guts
yur
may
but
this
child
to
take
the
shine
out
o
that
injun
shot
he
is
or
bust
several
of
the
bystanders
remarked
that
that
was
likely
enough
and
that
they
only
waited
to
see
in
what
manner
it
was
to
be
done
no
one
who
knew
him
doubted
old
rube
to
be
as
in
fact
he
was
one
of
the
very
best
marksmen
in
the
mountains
fully
equal
perhaps
to
the
indian
but
it
was
the
style
and
circumstances
which
had
given
such
to
the
shot
of
the
latter
it
was
not
every
day
that
a
beautiful
girl
could
be
found
to
stand
fire
as
the
squaw
had
done
and
it
was
not
every
hunter
who
would
have
ventured
to
fire
at
a
mark
so
placed
the
strength
of
the
feat
lay
in
its
newness
and
peculiarity
the
hunters
had
often
fired
at
the
mark
held
in
one
another
hands
there
were
few
who
would
like
to
carry
it
on
their
head
how
then
was
rube
to
take
the
shine
out
o
that
injun
shot
this
was
the
question
that
each
was
asking
the
other
and
which
was
at
length
put
directly
to
rube
himself
shet
up
your
answered
he
an
i
show
in
the
fust
place
then
all
see
that
this
hyur
prickly
ai
hef
size
the
squash
yes
sartainly
answered
several
voices
that
wur
one
sukumstance
in
his
favour
it
it
wur
it
wur
wal
hyur
another
the
injun

shot
his
mark

o

now
this
child
to
knock
off
o
the

kud
yur
injun

that
eh
boyees
no
no
do
that
beat
him
or
do
it
not
then
it
beats
him
it
does
far
better
hooray
vociferated
several
voices
amidst
yells
of
laughter
no
one
dissented
as
the
hunters
pleased
with
the
joke
were
anxious
to
see
it
carried
through
rube
did
not
detain
them
long
leaving
his
rifle
in
the
hands
of
his
friend
garey
he
led
the
old
mare
up
towards
the
spot
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
indian
girl
reaching
this
he
halted
we
all
expected
to
see
him
turn
the
animal
with
her
side
towards
us
thus
leaving
her
body
out
of
range
it
soon
became
evident
that
this
was
not
the
old
fellow
intention
it
would
have
spoiled
the
look
of
the
thing
had
he
done
so
and
that
idea
was
no
doubt
running
in
his
mind
choosing
a
place
where
the
ground
chanced
to
be
slightly
hollowed
out
he
led
the
mustang
forward
until
her
fore
feet
rested
in
the
hollow
the
tail
was
thus
thrown
above
the
body
having
squared
her
hips
to
the
camp
he
whispered
something
at
her
head
and
going
round
to
the
hind
quarters
adjusted
the
pear
upon
the
highest
curve
of
the
stump
he
then
came
walking
back
would
the
mare
stand
no
fear
of
that
she
had
been
trained
to
stand
in
one
place
for
a
longer
period
than
was
now
required
of
her
the
appearance
which
the
old
mare
exhibited
nothing
visible
but
her
hind
legs
and
buttocks
for
the
mules
had
stripped
her
tail
of
the
hair
had
by
this
time
wound
the
spectators
up
to
the
risible
point
and
most
of
them
were
yelling
stop
yur
wull
yur
said
rube
clutching
his
rifle
and
taking
his
stand
the
laughter
was
held
in
no
one
wishing
to
disturb
the
shot
now
old
do
waste
your
fodder
muttered
the
trapper
addressing
his
gun
which
the
next
moment
was
raised
and
levelled
no
one
doubted
but
that
rube
would
hit
the
object
at
which
he
was
aiming
it
was
a
shot
frequently
made
by
western
riflemen
that
is
a
mark
of
the
same
size
at
sixty
yards
and
no
doubt
rube
would
have
done
it
but
just
at
the
moment
of
his
pulling
trigger
the
mare
back
heaved
up
in
one
of
its
periodic
jerks
and
the
pitahaya
fell
to
the
ground
but
the
ball
had
sped
and
grazing
the
animal
shoulder
passed
through
one
of
her
ears
the
direction
of
the
bullet
was
not
known
until
afterwards
but
its
effect
was
visible
at
once
for
the
mare
stung
in
her
tenderest
part
uttered
a
sort
of
scream
and
wheeling
about
came
leaping
into
camp
kicking
over
everything
that
happened
to
lie
in
her
way
the
yells
and
loud
laughing
of
the
trappers
the
odd
ejaculations
of
the
indians
the
vayas
and
vivas
of
the
mexicans
the
wild
oaths
of
old
rube
himself
all
formed
a
medley
of
sounds
that
fell
strangely
upon
the
ear
and
to
give
an
idea
of
which
is
beyond
the
art
of
my
pen
chapter
twenty
three
the
programme
shortly
after
i
was
wandering
out
to
the
caballada
to
look
after
my
horse
when
the
sound
of
a
bugle
fell
upon
my
ear
it
was
the
signal
for
the
men
to
assemble
and
i
turned
back
towards
the
camp
as
i
it
seguin
was
standing
near
his
tent
with
the
bugle
still
in
his
hand
the
hunters
were
gathering
around
him
they
were
soon
all
assembled
and
stood
in
groups
waiting
for
the
chief
to
speak
comrades
said
seguin
we
break
up
this
camp
for
an
expedition
against
the
enemy
i
have
brought
you
together
that
you
may
know
my
plans
and
lend
me
your
advice
a
murmur
of
applause
followed
this
announcement
the
breaking
up
of
a
camp
is
always
joyous
news
to
men
whose
trade
is
war
it
seemed
to
have
a
like
effect
upon
this
motley
group
of
guerilleros
the
chief
continued
it
is
not
likely
that
you
will
have
much
fighting
our
dangers
will
be
those
of
the
desert
but
we
will
endeavour
to
provide
against
them
in
the
best
manner
possible
i
have
learned
from
a
reliable
source
that
our
enemies
are
at
this
very
time
about
starting
upon
a
grand
expedition
to
plunder
the
towns
of
sonora
and
chihuahua
it
is
their
intention
if
not
met
by
the
government
troops
to
extend
their
foray
to
durango
itself
both
tribes
have
combined
in
this
movement
and
it
is
believed
that
all
the
warriors
will
proceed
southward
leaving
their
country
unprotected
behind
them
it
is
my
intention
then
as
soon
as
i
can
ascertain
that
they
have
gone
out
to
enter
their
territory
and
pierce
to
the
main
town
of
the
navajoes
bravo
hooray
bueno
tres
bien
good
as
wheat
and
numerous
other
exclamations
hailed
this
declaration
some
of
you
know
my
object
in
making
this
expedition
others
do
not
i
will
declare
it
to
you
all
it
is
then
to
git
a
grist
of
scalps
what
else
cried
a
rough
fellow
interrupting
the
chief
no
kirker
replied
seguin
bending
his
eye
upon
the
man
with
an
expression
of
anger
it
is
not
that
we
expect
to
meet
only
women
on
his
peril
let
no
man
touch
a
hair
upon
the
head
of
an
indian
woman
i
shall
pay
for
no
scalps
of
women
or
children
where
then
will
be
your
profits
we
can
not
bring
them
prisoners
we
have
enough
to
do
to
get
back
ourselves
i
reckon
across
them
deserts
these
questions
seemed
to
express
the
feelings
of
others
of
the
band
who
muttered
their
assent
you
shall
lose
nothing
whatever
prisoners
you
take
shall
be
counted
on
the
ground
and
every
man
shall
be
paid
according
to
his
number
when
we
return
i
will
make
that
good
oh
that
fair
enough
captain
cried
several
voices
let
it
be
understood
then
no
women
nor
children
the
plunder
you
shall
have
it
is
yours
by
our
laws
but
no
blood
that
can
be
spared
there
is
enough
on
our
hands
already
do
you
all
bind
yourselves
to
this
yes
yes
si
oui
oui
ya
ya
all
todos
todos
cried
a
multitude
of
voices
each
man
answering
in
his
own
language
let
those
who
do
not
agree
to
it
speak
a
profound
silence
followed
this
proposal
all
had
bound
themselves
to
the
wishes
of
their
leader
i
am
glad
that
you
are
unanimous
i
will
now
state
my
purpose
fully
it
is
but
just
you
should
know
it
ay
let
us
know
that
muttered
kirker
if
tai
to
raise
har
goin
we
go
then
to
seek
for
our
friends
and
relatives
who
for
years
have
been
captives
to
our
savage
enemy
there
are
many
among
us
who
have
lost
kindred
wives
sisters
and
daughters
a
murmur
of
assent
uttered
chiefly
by
men
in
mexican
costume
testified
to
the
truth
of
this
statement
i
myself
continued
seguin
and
his
voice
slightly
trembled
as
he
spoke
am
among
that
number
years
long
years
ago
i
was
robbed
of
my
child
by
the
navajoes
i
have
lately
learned
that
she
is
still
alive
and
at
their
head
town
with
many
other
white
captives
we
go
then
to
release
and
restore
them
to
their
friends
and
homes
a
shout
of
approbation
broke
from
the
crowd
mingled
with
exclamations
of
bravo
we
fetch
them
back
vive
le
capitaine
viva
el
gefe
when
silence
was
restored
seguin
continued
you
know
our
purpose
you
have
approved
it
i
will
now
make
known
to
you
the
plan
i
had
designed
for
accomplishing
it
and
listen
to
your
advice
here
the
chief
paused
a
moment
while
the
men
remained
silent
and
waiting
there
are
three
passes
continued
he
at
length
by
which
we
might
enter
the
indian
country
from
this
side
there
is
first
the
route
of
the
western
puerco
that
would
lead
us
direct
to
the
navajo
towns
and
why
not
take
that
way
asked
one
of
the
hunters
a
mexican
i
know
the
route
well
as
far
as
the
pecos
towns
because
we
could
not
pass
the
pecos
towns
without
being
seen
by
navajo
spies
there
are
always
some
of
them
there
nay
more
continued
seguin
with
a
look
that
expressed
a
hidden
meaning
we
could
not
get
far
up
the
del
norte
itself
before
the
navajoes
would
be
warned
of
our
approach
we
have
enemies
nearer
home
carrai
that
is
true
said
a
hunter
speaking
in
spanish
should
they
get
word
of
our
coming
even
though
the
warriors
had
gone
southward
you
can
see
that
we
would
have
a
journey
for
nothing
true
true
shouted
several
voices
for
the
same
reason
we
can
not
take
the
pass
of
polvidera
besides
at
this
season
there
is
but
little
prospect
of
game
on
either
of
these
routes
we
are
not
prepared
for
an
expedition
with
our
present
supply
we
must
pass
through
a
before
we
can
enter
on
the
desert
that
is
true
captain
but
there
is
as
little
game
to
be
met
if
we
go
by
the
old
mine
what
other
road
then
can
we
take
there
is
still
another
route
better
than
all
i
think
we
will
strike
southward
and
then
west
across
the
llanos
to
the
old
mission
from
thence
we
can
go
north
into
the
apache
country
yes
yes
that
is
the
best
way
captain
we
will
have
a
longer
journey
but
with
advantages
we
will
find
the
wild
cattle
or
the
buffaloes
upon
the
llanos
moreover
we
will
make
sure
of
our
time
as
we
can
in
the
pinon
hills
that
overlook
the
apache
and
see
our
enemies
pass
out
when
they
have
gone
south
we
can
cross
the
gila
and
keep
up
the
azul
or
prieto
having
accomplished
the
object
of
our
expedition
we
may
then
return
homeward
by
the
nearest
route
bravo
viva
that
jest
right
captain
that
clarly
our
best
plan
were
a
few
among
the
many
forms
by
which
the
hunters
testified
their
approval
of
the
programme
there
was
no
dissenting
voice
the
word
prieto
struck
like
music
upon
their
ears
that
was
a
magic
word
the
name
of
the
river
on
whose
waters
the
trapper
legends
had
long
placed
the
el
dorado
the
mountain
of
gold
many
a
story
of
this
celebrated
region
had
been
told
at
the
hunters
all
agreeing
in
one
point
that
there
the
gold
lay
in
lumps
upon
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
filled
the
rivers
with
its
shining
grains
often
had
the
trappers
talked
of
an
expedition
to
this
unknown
land
and
small
parties
were
said
to
have
actually
entered
it
but
none
of
these
adventurers
had
ever
been
known
to
return
the
hunters
saw
now
for
the
first
time
the
prospect
of
penetrating
this
region
with
safety
and
their
minds
were
filled
with
fancies
wild
and
romantic
not
a
few
of
them
had
joined
seguin
band
in
hopes
that
some
day
this
very
expedition
might
be
undertaken
and
the
golden
mountain
reached
what
then
were
their
feelings
when
seguin
declared
his
purpose
of
travelling
by
the
prieto
at
the
mention
of
it
a
buzz
of
peculiar
meaning
ran
through
the
crowd
and
the
men
turned
to
each
other
with
looks
of
satisfaction
then
we
shall
march
added
the
chief
go
now
and
make
your
preparations
we
start
by
daybreak
as
seguin
ceased
speaking
the
hunters
departed
each
to
look
after
his
traps
and
possibles
a
duty
soon
performed
as
these
rude
rangers
were
but
little
encumbered
with
camp
equipage
i
sat
down
upon
a
log
watching
for
some
time
the
movements
of
my
wild
companions
and
listening
to
their
rude
and
converse
at
length
arrived
sunset
or
night
for
they
are
almost
synonymous
in
these
latitudes
fresh
logs
were
flung
upon
the
fires
till
they
blazed
up
the
men
sat
around
them
cooking
eating
smoking
talking
loudly
and
laughing
at
stories
that
illustrated
their
own
wild
habits
the
red
light
fell
upon
fierce
dark
faces
now
fiercer
and
more
swarthy
under
the
glare
of
the
burning
by
its
light
the
savage
expression
was
strengthened
on
every
countenance
beards
looked
darker
and
teeth
gleamed
whiter
through
them
eyes
appeared
more
sunken
and
their
glances
more
brilliant
and
picturesque
costumes
met
the
eye
turbans
spanish
hats
plumes
and
mottled
garments
escopettes
and
rifles
leaning
against
the
trees
saddles
resting
upon
logs
and
stumps
bridles
hanging
from
the
branches
overhead
strings
of
jerked
meat
drooping
in
festoons
in
front
of
the
tents
and
haunches
of
venison
still
smoking
and
dripping
their
drops
the
vermilion
smeared
on
the
foreheads
of
the
indian
warriors
gleamed
in
the
night
light
as
though
it
were
blood
it
was
a
picture
at
once
savage
and
warlike
warlike
but
with
an
aspect
of
ferocity
at
which
the
sensitive
heart
drew
back
it
was
a
picture
such
as
may
be
seen
only
in
a
bivouac
of
guerilleros
of
brigands
of
chapter
twenty
four
el
sol
and
la
luna
come
said
seguin
touching
me
on
the
arm
our
supper
is
ready
i
see
the
doctor
beckoning
us
i
was
not
slow
to
answer
the
call
for
the
cool
air
of
the
evening
had
sharpened
my
appetite
we
approached
the
tent
in
front
of
which
was
a
fire
over
this
the
doctor
assisted
by
gode
and
a
pueblo
peon
was
just
giving
the
finishing
touch
to
a
savoury
supper
part
of
it
had
already
been
carried
inside
the
tent
we
followed
it
and
took
our
seats
upon
saddles
blankets
and
packs
why
doctor
said
seguin
you
have
proved
yourself
a

let
us
to
them
at
once
oui
oui

monsieur
capitaine
said
gode
hurrying
in
with
a
multitude
of
viands
the
canadien
was
always
in
his
element
when
there
was
plenty
to
cook
and
eat
we
were
soon
engaged
on
fresh
steaks
of
wild
cows
roasted
ribs
of
venison
dried
buffalo
tongues
tortillas
and
coffee
the
coffee
and
tortillas
were
the
labours
of
the
pueblo
in
the
preparation
of
which
viands
he
was
gode
master
but
gode
had
a
choice
dish
petit
in
reserve
which
he
brought
forth
with
a
triumphant
flourish

he

before

and
the
doctor
held
out
his
platter
to
be
helped
gode
in
wandering
by
the
river
had
encountered
a
pond
of
giant
frogs
and
the
fricassee
was
the
result
i
had
not
then
overcome
my
national
antipathy
to
the
victims
of
saint
patrick
curse
and
to
the
voyageur
astonishment
i
refused
to
share
the
dainty
during
our
supper
conversation
i
gathered
some
facts
of
the
history
which
with
what
i
had
already
learned
rendered
the
old
man
an
object
of
extreme
interest
to
me
up
to
this
time
i
had
wondered
what
such
a
character
could
be
doing
in
such
company
as
that
of
the
i
now
learned
a
few
details
that
explained
all
his
name
was
reichter
friedrich
reichter
he
was
a
strasburgher
and
in
the
city
of
bells
had
been
a
medical
practitioner
of
some
repute
the
love
of
science
but
particularly
of
his
favourite
branch
botany
had
lured
him
away
from
his
rhenish
home
he
had
wandered
to
the
united
states
then
to
the
far
west
to
classify
the
flora
of
that
remote
region
he
had
spent
several
years
in
the
great
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
falling
in
with
one
of
the
saint
louis
caravans
had
crossed
the
prairies
to
the
oasis
of
new
mexico
in
his
scientific
wanderings
along
the
del
norte
he
had
met
with
the
and
attracted
by
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
him
of
penetrating
into
regions
hitherto
unexplored
by
the
devotees
of
science
he
had
offered
to
accompany
the
band
this
offer
was
gladly
accepted
on
account
of
his
services
as
their
medico
and
for
two
years
he
had
been
with
them
sharing
their
hardships
and
dangers
many
a
scene
of
peril
had
he
passed
through
many
a
privation
had
he
undergone
prompted
by
a
love
of
his
favourite
study
and
perhaps
too
by
the
dreams
of
future
triumph
when
he
would
one
day
spread
his
strange
flora
before
the
of
europe
poor
reichter
poor
friedrich
reichter
yours
was
the
dream
of
a
dream
it
never
became
a
reality
our
supper
was
at
length
finished
and
washed
down
with
a
bottle
of
paso
wine
there
was
plenty
of
this
as
well
as
taos
whisky
in
the
encampment
and
the
roars
of
laughter
that
reached
us
from
without
proved
that
the
hunters
were
imbibing
freely
of
the
latter
the
doctor
drew
out
his
great
meerschaum
gode
filled
a
red
claystone
while
seguin
and
i
lit
our
husk
cigarettes
but
tell
me
said
i
addressing
seguin
who
is
the
indian
he
who
performed
the
wild
feat
of
shooting
the
ah
el
sol
he
is
a
coco
a
coco
yes
of
the
maricopa
tribe
but
that
makes
me
no
wiser
than
before
i
knew
that
much
already
you
knew
it
who
told
you
i
heard
old
rube
mention
the
fact
to
his
comrade
garey
ay
true
he
should
know
him
seguin
remained
silent
well
continued
i
wishing
to
learn
more
who
are
the
maricopas
i
have
never
heard
of
them
it
is
a
tribe
but
little
known
a
nation
of
singular
men
they
are
foes
of
the
apache
and
navajo
their
country
lies
down
the
gila
they
came
originally
from
the
pacific
from
the
shores
of
the
californian
sea
but
this
man
is
educated
or
seems
so
he
speaks
english
and
french
as
well
as
you
or
i
he
appears
to
be
talented
intelligent
polite
in
short
a
gentleman
he
is
all
you
have
said
i
can
not
understand
this
i
will
explain
to
you
my
friend
that
man
was
educated
at
one
of
the
most
celebrated
universities
in
europe
he
has
travelled
farther
and
through
more
countries
perhaps
than
either
of
us
but
how
did
he
accomplish
all
this
an
indian
by
the
aid
of
that
which
has
often
enabled
very
little
men
though
el
sol
is
not
one
of
those
to
achieve
very
great
deeds
or
at
least
to
get
the
credit
of
having
done
so
by
gold
gold
and
where
got
he
the
gold
i
have
been
told
that
there
is
very
little
of
it
in
the
hands
of
indians
the
white
men
have
robbed
them
of
all
they
once
had
that
is
in
general
a
truth
and
true
of
the
maricopas
there
was
a
time
when
they
possessed
gold
in
large
quantities
and
pearls
too
gathered
from
the
depths
of
the
vermilion
sea
it
is
gone
the
jesuit
padres
could
tell
whither
but
this
man
el
sol
he
is
a
chief
he
has
not
lost
all
his
gold
he
still
holds
enough
to
serve
him
and
it
is
not
likely
that
the
padres
will
coax
it
from
him
for
either
beads
or
vermilion
no
he
has
seen
the
world
and
has
learnt
the
value
of
that
shining
metal
but
his
sister
is
she
too
educated
no
poor
luna
is
still
a
savage
but
he
instructs
her
in
many
things
he
has
been
absent
for
several
years
he
has
returned
but
lately
to
his
tribe
their
names
are
strange
sun
moon
they
were
given
by
the
spaniards
of
sonora
but
they
are
only
translations
or
synonyms
of
their
indian
appellations
that
is
common
upon
the
frontier
why
are
they
here
i
put
this
question
with
hesitation
as
i
knew
there
might
be
some
peculiar
history
connected
with
the
answer
partly
replied
seguin
from
gratitude
i
believe
to
myself
i
rescued
el
sol
when
a
boy
out
of
the
hands
of
the
navajoes
perhaps
there
is
still
another
reason
but
come
continued
he
apparently
wishing
to
give
a
turn
to
the
conversation
you
shall
know
our
indian
friends
you
are
to
be
companions
for
a
time
he
is
a
scholar
and
will
interest
you
take
care
of
your
heart
with
the
gentle
luna
vincente
go
to
the
tent
of
the
coco
chief
ask
him
to
come
and
drink
a
cup
of
paso
wine
tell
him
to
bring
his
sister
with
him
the
servant
hurried
away
through
the
camp
while
he
was
gone
we
conversed
about
the
feat
which
the
coco
had
performed
with
his
rifle
i
never
knew
him
to
fire
remarked
seguin
without
hitting
his
mark
there
is
something
mysterious
about
that
his
aim
is
unerring
and
it
seems
to
be
on
his
part
an
act
of
pure
volition
there
may
be
some
guiding
principle
in
the
mind
independent
of
either
strength
of
nerve
or
sharpness
of
sight
he
and
another
are
the
only
persons
i
ever
knew
to
possess
this
singular
power
the
last
part
of
this
speech
was
uttered
in
a
half
soliloquy
and
seguin
after
delivering
it
remained
for
some
moments
silent
and
abstracted
before
the
conversation
was
resumed
el
sol
and
his
sister
entered
the
tent
and
seguin
introduced
us
to
each
other
in
a
few
moments
we
were
engaged
el
sol
the
doctor
seguin
and
myself
in
an
animated
conversation
the
subject
was
not
horses
nor
guns
nor
scalps
nor
war
nor
blood
nor
aught
connected
with
the
horrid
calling
of
that
camp
we
were
discussing
a
point
in
the
pacific
science
of
botany
the
relationship
of
the
different
forms
of
the
cactus
family
i
had
studied
the
science
and
i
felt
that
my
knowledge
of
it
was
inferior
to
that
of
any
of
my
three
companions
i
was
struck
with
it
then
and
more
when
i
reflected
on
it
afterwards
the
fact
of
such
a
conversation
the
time
the
place
and
the
men
who
carried
it
on
for
nearly
two
hours
we
sat
smoking
and
talking
on
like
subjects
while
we
were
thus
engaged
i
observed
upon
the
canvas
the
shadow
of
a
man
looking
forth
as
my
position
enabled
me
without
rising
i
recognised
in
the
light
that
streamed
out
of
the
tent
a
with
a
worked
hanging
over
the
breast
la
luna
sat
near
her
brother
sewing
parfleche
soles
upon
a
pair
of
moccasins
i
noticed
that
she
had
an
abstracted
air
and
at
short
intervals
glanced
out
from
the
opening
of
the
tent
while
we
were
engrossed
with
our
discussion
she
rose
silently
though
not
with
any
appearance
of
stealth
and
went
out
after
a
while
she
returned
i
could
read
the
in
her
eye
as
she
resumed
her
occupation
el
sol
and
his
sister
at
length
left
us
and
shortly
after
seguin
the
doctor
and
i
rolled
ourselves
in
our
serapes
and
lay
down
to
sleep
chapter
twenty
five
the
the
band
was
mounted
by
the
earliest
dawn
and
as
the
notes
of
the
bugle
died
away
our
horses
plashed
through
the
river
crossing
to
the
other
side
we
soon
debouched
from
the
timber
bottom
coming
out
upon
sandy
plains
that
stretched
westward
to
the
mibres
mountains
we
rode
over
these
plains
in
a
southerly
direction
climbing
long
ridges
of
sand
that
traversed
them
from
east
to
west
the
drift
lay
in
deep
furrows
and
our
horses
sank
above
the
fetlocks
as
we
journeyed
we
were
crossing
the
western
section
of
the
jornada
we
travelled
in
indian
file
habit
has
formed
this
disposition
among
indians
and
hunters
on
the
march
the
tangled
paths
of
the
forest
and
the
narrow
defiles
of
the
mountains
admit
of
no
other
even
when
passing
a
plain
our
cavalcade
was
strung
out
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
atajo
followed
in
charge
of
the
arrieros
for
the
first
day
of
our
march
we
kept
on
without
nooning
there
was
neither
grass
nor
water
on
the
route
and
a
halt
under
the
hot
sun
would
not
have
refreshed
us
early
in
the
afternoon
a
dark
line
became
visible
stretching
across
the
plain
as
we
drew
nearer
a
green
wall
rose
before
us
and
we
distinguished
the
groves
of
the
hunters
knew
it
to
be
the
timber
on
the
paloma
we
were
soon
passing
under
the
shade
of
its
quivering
canopy
and
reaching
the
banks
of
a
clear
stream
we
halted
for
the
night
our
camp
was
formed
without
either
tents
or
lodges
those
used
on
the
del
norte
had
been
left
behind
in
cache
an
expedition
like
ours
could
not
be
cumbered
with
camp
baggage
each
man
blanket
was
his
house
his
bed
and
his
cloak
fires
were
kindled
and
ribs
roasted
and
fatigued
with
our
journey
the
first
day
ride
has
always
this
effect
we
were
soon
wrapped
in
our
blankets
and
sleeping
soundly
we
were
summoned
next
morning
by
the
call
of
the
bugle
sounding
reveille
the
band
partook
somewhat
of
a
military
organisation
and
everyone
understood
the
signals
of
light
cavalry
our
breakfast
was
soon
cooked
and
eaten
our
horses
were
drawn
from
their
pickets
saddled
and
mounted
and
at
another
signal
we
moved
forward
on
the
route
the
incidents
of
our
first
journey
were
repeated
with
but
little
variety
for
several
days
in
succession
we
travelled
through
a
desert
country
here
and
there
covered
with
wild
sage
and
mezquite
we
passed
on
our
route
clumps
of
cacti
and
thickets
of
creosote
bushes
that
emitted
their
foul
odours
as
we
crushed
through
them
on
the
fourth
evening
we
camped
at
a
spring
the
ojo
de
vaca
lying
on
the
eastern
borders
of
the
llanos
over
the
western
section
of
this
great
prairie
passes
the
apache
running
southward
into
sonora
near
the
trail
and
overlooking
it
a
high
mountain
rises
out
of
the
plain
it
is
the
pinon
it
was
our
design
to
reach
this
mountain
and
cacher
among
the
rocks
near
a
spring
until
our
enemies
should
pass
but
to
effect
this
we
would
have
to
cross
the
and
our
own
tracks
would
betray
us
here
was
a
difficulty
which
had
not
occurred
to
seguin
there
was
no
other
point
except
the
pinon
from
which
we
could
certainly
see
the
enemy
on
their
route
and
be
ourselves
hidden
this
mountain
then
must
be
reached
and
how
were
we
to
effect
it
without
crossing
the
trail
after
our
arrival
at
ojo
de
vaca
seguin
drew
the
men
together
to
deliberate
on
this
matter
let
us
spread
said
a
hunter
and
keep
wide
over
the
paraira
till
we
got
clar
past
the
apash
trail
they
wo
notice
a
single
track
hyar
and
thyar
i
reckin
ay
but
they
will
though
rejoined
another
do
ye
think
an
to
pass
a
shod
horse
track
follerin
it
up
no
siree
we
kin
muffle
the
hoofs
as
far
as
that
goes
suggested
the
first
speaker
wagh
that
ud
only
make
it
worse
i
tried
that
dodge
once
afore
nearly
lost
my
har
for
it
he
a
blind
injun
kin
be
fooled
that
away
do
nohow
they
not
going
to
be
so
partickler
when
they
on
the
i
warrant
ye
i
do
see
why
it
should
do
well
enough
most
of
the
hunters
agreed
with
the
former
speaker
the
indians
would
not
fail
to
notice
so
many
muffled
tracks
and
suspect
there
was
something
in
the
wind
the
idea
of
muffling
was
therefore
abandoned
what
next
the
trapper
rube
who
up
to
this
time
had
said
nothing
now
drew
the
attention
of
all
by
abruptly
exclaiming
pish
well
what
have
you
to
say
old
hoss
inquired
one
of
the
hunters
thet
yur
a
set
o
fools
one
and
all
o
ee
i
kud
take
the
full
that
paraira
o
hosses
acrosst
the
trail
making
a
sign
that
any
injun
to
foller
particularly
an
injun
on
the
as
them
is
now
how
asked
seguin
i
tell
yur
how
cap
ev
yur
tell
me
what
wants
to
cross
the
trail
for
why
to
conceal
ourselves
in
the
pinon
range
what
else
an
how
are
gwine
to
in
the
peenyun
water
there
is
a
spring
on
the
side
of
it
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
that
true
as
scripter
i
knows
that
but
at
that
very
spring
the
injuns
cool
their
lappers
as
they
go
down
how
are
gwine
to
get
at
it
with
this
cavayard
makin
sign
this
child
do
see
that
very
clur
you
are
right
rube
we
can
not
touch
the
pinon
spring
without
leaving
our
marks
too
plainly
and
it
is
the
very
place
where
the
may
make
a
halt
i
sees
no
confoundered
use
in
the
hul
on
us
crossin
the
paraira
now
we
ka
hunt
buffler
till
they
passed
anyways
so
it
this
child
idee
that
a
dozen
o
us
be
enough
to
in
the
peenyun
and
watch
for
the
niggurs
south
a
dozen
mout
do
it
safe
enough
but
not
the
hul
cavayard
and
would
you
have
the
rest
to
remain
here
not
hyur
let
go
from
hyur
and
then
strike
west
through
the
musquite
hills
thur
a
crick
runs
thur
about
twenty
mile
or
so
this
side
the
trail
they
can
git
water
and
grass
and
thur
till
we
sends
for
but
why
not
remain
by
this
spring
where
we
have
both
in
plenty
jest
because
some
o
the
injun
party
may
take
a
notion
in
thur
heads
to
kum
this
way
themselves
i
reckin
we
had
better
make
blind
tracks
before
leavin
hyur
the
force
of
rube
reasoning
was
apparent
to
all
and
to
none
more
than
seguin
himself
it
was
resolved
to
follow
his
advice
at
once
the
vidette
party
was
told
off
and
the
rest
of
the
band
with
the
atajo
after
blinding
the
tracks
around
the
spring
struck
off
in
a
direction
they
were
to
travel
on
to
the
mezquite
hills
that
lay
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
to
the
of
the
spring
there
they
were
to
cacher
by
a
stream
well
known
to
several
of
them
and
wait
until
warned
to
join
us
the
vidette
party
of
whom
i
was
one
moved
westward
across
the
prairie
rube
garey
el
sol
and
his
sister
with
sanchez
a
and
half
a
dozen
others
composed
the
party
seguin
himself
was
our
head
and
guide
before
leaving
the
ojo
de
vaca
we
had
stripped
the
shoes
off
the
horses
filling
the
with
clay
so
that
their
tracks
would
be
taken
for
those
of
wild
mustangs
such
were
the
precautions
of
men
who
knew
that
their
lives
might
be
the
forfeit
of
a
single
footprint
as
we
approached
the
point
where
the
intersected
the
prairie
we
separated
and
deployed
to
distances
of
half
a
mile
each
in
this
manner
we
rode
forward
to
the
pinon
mountain
where
we
came
together
again
and
turned
northward
along
the
foot
of
the
range
it
was
sundown
when
we
reached
the
spring
having
ridden
all
day
across
the
plain
we
descried
it
as
we
approached
close
in
to
the
mountain
foot
and
marked
by
a
grove
of
and
willows
we
did
not
take
our
horses
near
the
water
but
having
reached
a
defile
in
the
mountain
we
rode
into
it
and
cached
them
in
a
thicket
of
in
this
thicket
we
spent
the
night
with
the
first
light
of
morning
we
made
a
reconnaissance
of
our
cache
in
front
of
us
was
a
low
ridge
covered
with
loose
rocks
and
straggling
trees
of
the
this
ridge
separated
the
defile
from
the
plain
and
from
its
top
screened
by
a
thicket
of
the
pines
we
commanded
a
view
of
the
water
as
well
as
the
trail
and
the
llanos
stretching
away
to
the
north
south
and
east
it
was
just
the
sort
of
we
required
for
our
object
in
the
morning
it
became
necessary
to
descend
for
water
for
this
purpose
we
had
provided
ourselves
with
a
and
extra
xuages
we
visited
the
spring
and
filled
our
vessels
taking
care
to
leave
no
traces
of
out
footsteps
in
the
mud
we
kept
constant
watch
during
the
first
day
but
no
indians
appeared
deer
and
antelopes
with
a
small
gang
of
buffaloes
came
to
the
to
drink
and
then
roamed
off
again
over
the
green
meadows
it
was
a
tempting
sight
for
we
could
easily
have
crept
within
shot
but
we
dared
not
touch
them
we
knew
that
the
indian
dogs
would
scent
their
slaughter
in
the
evening
we
went
again
for
water
making
the
journey
twice
as
our
animals
began
to
suffer
from
thirst
we
adopted
the
same
precautions
as
before
next
day
we
again
watched
the
horizon
to
the
north
with
eager
eyes
seguin
had
a
small
and
we
could
see
the
prairie
with
it
for
a
distance
of
nearly
thirty
miles
but
as
yet
no
enemy
could
be
descried
the
third
day
passed
with
a
like
result
and
we
began
to
fear
that
the
warriors
had
taken
some
other
trail
another
circumstance
rendered
us
uneasy
we
had
eaten
nearly
the
whole
of
our
provisions
and
were
now
chewing
the
raw
nuts
of
the
pinon
we
dared
not
kindle
a
fire
to
roast
them
indians
can
read
the
smoke
at
a
great
distance
the
fourth
day
arrived
and
still
no
sign
on
the
horizon
to
the
north
our
tasajo
was
all
eaten
and
we
began
to
hunger
the
nuts
did
not
satisfy
us
the
game
was
in
plenty
at
the
spring
and
mottling
the
grassy
plain
one
proposed
to
lie
among
the
willows
and
shoot
an
antelope
or
a
deer
of
which
there
were
troops
in
the
neighbourhood
we
dare
not
said
seguin
their
dogs
would
find
the
blood
it
might
betray
us
i
can
procure
one
without
letting
a
drop
rejoined
a
mexican
hunter
how
inquired
several
in
a
breath
the
man
pointed
to
his
lasso
but
your
tracks
you
would
make
deep
footmarks
in
the
struggle
we
can
blind
them
captain
rejoined
the
man
you
may
try
then
assented
the
chief
the
mexican
unfastened
the
lasso
from
his
saddle
and
taking
a
companion
proceeded
to
the
spring
they
crept
in
among
the
willows
and
lay
in
wait
we
watched
them
from
the
ridge
they
had
not
remained
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
a
herd
of
antelopes
was
seen
approaching
from
the
plain
these
walked
directly
for
the
spring
one
following
the
other
in
indian
file
they
were
soon
close
in
to
the
willows
where
the
hunters
had
concealed
themselves
here
they
suddenly
halted
throwing
up
their
heads
and
snuffing
the
air
they
had
scented
danger
but
it
was
too
late
for
the
foremost
to
turn
and
lope
off
yonder
goes
the
lasso
cried
one
we
saw
the
noose
flying
in
the
air
and
settling
over
his
head
the
herd
suddenly
wheeled
but
the
loop
was
around
the
neck
of
their
leader
and
after
three
or
four
skips
he
sprang
up
and
falling
upon
his
back
lay
motionless
the
hunter
came
out
from
the
willows
and
taking
up
the
animal
now
choked
dead
carried
him
towards
the
entrance
of
the
defile
his
companion
followed
blinding
the
tracks
of
both
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
reached
us
the
antelope
was
skinned
and
eaten
raw
in
the
blood
our
horses
grow
thin
with
hunger
and
thirst
we
fear
to
go
too
often
to
the
water
though
we
become
less
cautious
as
the
hours
pass
two
more
antelopes
are
lassoed
by
the
expert
hunter
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
is
clear
moonlight
the
indians
often
march
by
moonlight
particularly
when
on
the
we
keep
our
vidette
stationed
during
the
night
as
in
the
day
on
this
night
we
look
out
with
more
hopes
than
usual
it
is
such
a
lovely
night
a
full
moon
clear
and
calm
we
are
not
disappointed
near
midnight
the
vidette
awakes
us
there
are
dark
forms
on
the
sky
away
to
the
north
it
may
be
buffaloes
but
we
see
that
they
are
approaching
we
stand
one
and
all
straining
our
eyes
through
the
white
air
and
away
over
the
silvery
sward
there
are
glancing
objects
arms
it
must
be
horses
horsemen
they
are
indians
oh
god
comrades
we
are
mad
our
horses
they
may
neigh
we
bound
after
our
leader
down
the
hill
over
the
rocks
and
through
the
trees
we
run
for
the
thicket
where
our
animals
are
tied
we
may
be
too
late
for
horses
can
hear
each
other
miles
off
and
the
slightest
concussion
vibrates
afar
through
the
elastic
atmosphere
of
these
high
plateaux
we
reach
the
caballada
what
is
seguin
doing
he
has
torn
the
blanket
from
under
his
saddle
and
is
muffling
the
head
of
his
horse
we
follow
his
example
without
exchanging
a
word
for
we
know
this
is
the
only
plan
to
pursue
in
a
few
minutes
we
feel
secure
again
and
return
to
our
on
the
height
we
had
shaved
our
time
closely
for
on
reaching
the
we
could
hear
the
exclamations
of
indians
the
thump
thump
of
hoofs
on
the
hard
plain
and
an
occasional
neigh
as
their
horses
scented
the
water
the
foremost
were
advancing
to
the
spring
and
we
could
see
the
long
line
of
mounted
men
stretching
in
their
deploying
to
the
far
horizon
closer
they
came
and
we
could
distinguish
the
pennons
and
glittering
points
of
their
spears
we
could
see
their
bodies
gleaming
in
the
clear
moonlight
in
a
short
time
the
foremost
of
them
had
ridden
up
to
the
bushes
halting
as
they
came
and
giving
their
animals
to
drink
then
one
by
one
they
wheeled
out
of
the
water
and
trotting
a
short
distance
over
the
prairie
flung
themselves
to
the
ground
and
commenced
unharnessing
their
horses
it
was
evidently
their
intention
to
camp
for
the
night
for
nearly
an
hour
they
came
filing
forward
until
two
thousand
warriors
with
their
horses
dotted
the
plain
below
us
we
stood
observing
their
movements
we
had
no
fear
of
being
seen
ourselves
we
were
lying
with
our
bodies
behind
the
rocks
and
our
faces
partially
screened
by
the
foliage
of
the
pinon
trees
we
could
see
and
hear
with
distinctness
all
that
was
passing
for
the
savages
were
not
over
three
hundred
yards
from
our
position
they
proceed
to
picket
their
horses
in
a
wide
circle
far
out
on
the
plain
there
the
grama
grass
is
longer
and
more
luxuriant
than
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
spring
they
strip
the
animals
and
bring
away
their
consisting
of
hair
bridles
buffalo
robes
and
skins
of
the
grizzly
bear
few
have
saddles
indians
do
not
generally
use
them
on
a
war
expedition
each
man
strikes
his
spear
into
the
ground
and
rests
against
it
his
shield
bow
and
quiver
he
places
his
robe
or
skin
beside
it
that
is
his
tent
and
bed
the
spears
are
soon
aligned
upon
the
prairie
forming
a
front
of
several
hundred
yards
and
thus
they
have
pitched
their
camp
with
a
quickness
and
regularity
far
outstripping
the
chasseurs
of
vincennes
they
are
encamped
in
two
parties
there
are
two
bands
the
apache
and
navajo
the
latter
is
much
the
smaller
and
rests
farther
off
from
our
position
we
hear
them
cutting
and
chopping
with
their
tomahawks
among
the
thickets
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
can
see
them
carrying
faggots
out
upon
the
plain
piling
them
together
and
setting
them
on
fire
many
fires
are
soon
blazing
brightly
the
savages
squat
around
them
cooking
their
suppers
we
can
see
the
paint
glittering
on
their
faces
and
naked
breasts
they
are
of
many
hues
some
are
red
as
though
they
were
smeared
with
blood
some
appear
of
a
jetty
blackness
some
black
on
one
side
of
the
face
and
red
or
white
on
the
other
some
are
mottled
like
hounds
and
some
striped
and
chequered
their
cheeks
and
breasts
are
tattooed
with
the
forms
of
animals
wolves
panthers
bears
buffaloes
and
other
hideous
devices
plainly
discernible
under
the
blaze
of
the
fires
some
have
a
red
hand
painted
on
their
bosoms
and
not
a
few
exhibit
as
their
device
the
death
head
and
all
these
are
their
coats
of
arms
symbolical
of
the
medicine
of
the
wearer
adopted
no
doubt
from
like
silly
fancies
to
those
which
put
the
crest
upon
the
carriage
on
the
lackey
button
or
the
brass
seal
stamp
of
the
merchant
clerk
there
is
vanity
in
the
wilderness
in
savage
as
in
civilised
life
there
is
a
snobdom
what
do
we
see
bright
helmets
brazen
and
steel
with
nodding
plumes
of
the
ostrich
these
upon
savages
whence
came
these
from
the
cuirassiers
of
chihuahua
poor
devils
they
were
roughly
handled
upon
one
occasion
by
these
savage
lancers
we
see
the
red
meat
spluttering
over
the
fires
upon
spits
of
willow
rods
we
see
the
indians
fling
the
pinon
nuts
into
the
cinders
and
then
draw
them
forth
again
parched
and
smoking
we
see
them
light
their
claystone
pipes
and
send
forth
clouds
of
blue
vapour
we
see
them
gesticulate
as
they
relate
their
red
adventures
to
one
another
we
hear
them
shout
and
chatter
and
laugh
like
mountebanks
how
unlike
the
forest
indian
for
two
hours
we
watch
their
movements
and
listen
to
their
voices
then
the
is
detailed
and
marches
off
to
the
caballada
and
the
indians
one
after
another
spread
their
skins
roll
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
sleep
the
fires
cease
to
blaze
but
by
the
moonlight
we
can
distinguish
the
prostrate
bodies
of
the
savages
white
objects
are
moving
among
them
they
are
dogs
prowling
after
the
of
their
supper
these
run
from
point
to
point
snarling
at
one
another
and
barking
at
the
coyotes
that
sneak
around
the
skirts
of
the
camp
out
upon
the
prairie
the
horses
are
still
awake
and
busy
we
can
hear
them
stamping
their
hoofs
and
cropping
the
rich
pasture
erect
forms
are
seen
standing
at
intervals
along
the
line
these
are
the
guards
of
the
caballada
chapter
twenty
six
three
days
in
the
trap
our
attention
was
now
turned
to
our
own
situation
dangers
and
difficulties
suddenly
presented
themselves
to
our
minds
what
if
they
should
stay
here
to
hunt
the
thought
seemed
to
occur
to
all
of
us
at
the
same
instant
and
we
faced
each
other
with
looks
of
apprehension
and
dismay
it
is
not
improbable
said
seguin
in
a
low
and
emphatic
voice
it
is
plain
they
have
no
supply
of
meat
and
how
are
they
to
pass
to
the
south
without
it
they
must
hunt
here
or
elsewhere
why
not
here
if
so
we
in
a
nice
trap
interrupted
a
hunter
pointing
first
to
the
embouchure
of
the
defile
and
then
to
the
mountain
how
are
we
to
get
out
i
like
to
know
that
our
eyes
followed
the
direction
indicated
by
the
speaker
in
front
of
the
ravine
in
which
we
were
extended
the
line
of
the
indian
camp
not
a
hundred
yards
distant
from
the
rocks
that
lay
around
its
entrance
there
was
an
indian
sentinel
still
nearer
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
out
even
were
he
asleep
without
encountering
the
dogs
that
prowled
in
numbers
around
the
camp
behind
us
the
mountain
rose
vertically
like
a
wall
it
was
plainly
impassable
we
were
fairly
in
the
trap
carrai
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
we
will
die
of
hunger
and
thirst
if
they
stay
to
hunt
we
may
die
sooner
rejoined
another
if
they
take
a
notion
in
their
heads
to
wander
up
the
gully
this
was
not
improbable
though
it
was
but
little
likely
the
ravine
was
a
sort
of
de
that
entered
the
mountain
in
a
slanting
direction
and
ended
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliff
there
was
no
object
to
attract
our
enemies
into
it
unless
indeed
they
might
come
up
in
search
of
pinon
nuts
some
of
their
dogs
too
might
wander
up
hunting
for
food
or
attracted
by
the
scent
of
our
horses
these
were
probabilities
and
we
trembled
as
each
of
them
was
suggested
if
they
do
not
find
us
said
seguin
encouragingly
we
may
live
for
a
day
or
two
on
the
pinons
when
these
fail
us
one
of
our
horses
must
be
killed
how
much
water
have
we
thank
our
luck
captain
the
gourds
are
nearly
full
but
our
poor
animals
must
suffer
there
is
no
danger
of
thirst
said
el
sol
looking
downward
while
these
last
and
he
struck
with
his
foot
a
large
round
mass
that
grew
among
the
rocks
it
was
the
spheroidal
cactus
see
continued
he
there
are
hundreds
of
them
all
present
knew
the
meaning
of
this
and
regarded
the
cacti
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
comrades
said
seguin
it
is
of
no
use
to
weary
ourselves
let
those
sleep
who
can
one
can
keep
watch
yonder
while
another
stays
up
here
go
sanchez
and
the
chief
pointed
down
the
ravine
to
a
spot
that
commanded
a
view
of
its
mouth
the
sentinel
walked
off
and
took
his
stand
in
silence
the
rest
of
us
descended
and
after
looking
to
the
muffling
of
our
horses
returned
to
the
station
of
the
vidette
upon
the
hill
here
we
rolled
ourselves
in
our
blankets
and
lying
down
among
the
rocks
slept
out
the
night
we
were
awake
before
dawn
and
peering
through
the
leaves
with
feelings
of
keen
solicitude
there
is
no
movement
in
the
indian
camp
it
is
a
bad
indication
had
they
intended
to
travel
on
they
would
have
been
stirring
before
this
they
are
always
on
the
route
before
daybreak
these
signs
strengthen
our
feelings
of
apprehension
the
grey
light
begins
to
spread
over
the
prairie
there
is
a
white
band
along
the
eastern
sky
there
are
noises
in
the
camp
there
are
voices
dark
forms
move
about
among
the
upright
spears
tall
savages
stride
over
the
plain
their
robes
of
skins
are
wrapped
around
their
shoulders
to
protect
them
from
the
raw
air
of
the
morning
they
carry
faggots
they
are
rekindling
the
fires
our
men
talk
in
whispers
as
we
lie
straining
our
eyes
to
catch
every
movement
it
plain
they
intend
to
make
a
stay
of
it
ay
we
in
for
it
that
sartin
wagh
i
wonder
how
long
thar
to
squat
hyar
any
how
three
days
at
the
least
may
be
four
or
five
great
gollies
we
be
froze
in
half
the
time
what
would
they
be
doin
here
so
long
i
warrant
ye
they
clar
out
as
soon
as
they
can
so
they
will
but
how
can
they
in
less
time
they
can
get
all
the
meat
they
want
in
a
day
see
yonder
buffalo
a
plenty
look
away
yonder
and
the
speaker
points
to
several
black
objects
outlined
against
the
brightening
sky
it
is
a
herd
of
buffaloes
that
true
enough
in
half
a
day
i
warrant
they
kin
get
all
the
meat
they
want
but
how
are
they
to
jirk
it
in
less
than
three
that
what
i
want
to
know
es
verdad
says
one
of
the
mexicans
a
cibolero
tres
dias
al
menos
it
is
true
three
days
at
the
least
ay
hombre
an
with
a
smart
chance
o
sunshine
at
that
i
guess
this
conversation
is
carried
on
by
two
or
three
of
the
men
in
a
low
tone
but
loud
enough
for
the
rest
of
us
to
overhear
it
it
reveals
a
new
phase
of
our
dilemma
on
which
we
have
not
before
reflected
should
the
indians
stay
to
jerk
their
meat
we
will
be
in
extreme
danger
from
thirst
as
well
as
of
being
discovered
in
our
cache
we
know
that
the
process
of
jerking
buffalo
beef
takes
three
days
and
that
with
a
hot
sun
as
the
hunter
has
intimated
this
with
the
first
day
required
for
hunting
will
keep
us
four
days
in
the
ravine
the
prospect
is
appalling
we
feel
that
death
or
the
extreme
torture
of
thirst
is
before
us
we
have
no
fear
of
hunger
our
horses
are
in
the
grove
and
our
knives
in
our
belts
we
can
live
for
weeks
upon
them
but
will
the
cacti
assuage
the
thirst
of
men
and
horses
for
a
period
of
three
or
four
days
this
is
a
question
no
one
can
answer
it
has
often
relieved
the
hunter
for
a
short
period
enabling
him
to
crawl
on
to
the
water
but
for
days
the
trial
will
soon
commence
the
day
has
fairly
broken
the
indians
spring
to
their
feet
about
of
them
draw
the
pickets
of
their
horses
and
lead
them
to
the
water
they
adjust
their
bridles
pluck
up
their
spears
snatch
their
bows
shoulder
their
quivers
and
leap
on
horseback
after
a
short
consultation
they
gallop
off
to
the
eastward
in
half
an
hour
time
we
can
see
them
running
the
buffalo
far
out
upon
the
prairie
piercing
them
with
their
arrows
and
impaling
them
on
their
long
lances
those
who
have
remained
behind
lead
their
horses
down
to
the
and
back
again
to
the
grass
now
they
chop
down
young
trees
and
carry
faggots
to
the
fires
see
they
are
driving
long
stakes
into
the
ground
and
stretching
ropes
from
one
to
the
other
for
what
purpose
we
know
too
well
ha
look
yonder
mutters
one
of
the
hunters
as
this
is
first
noticed
yonder
goes
the
now
we
caged

i

carambo
carrajo
chingaro
growls
the
cibolero
who
well
knows
the
meaning
of
those
stakes
and
lines
we
watch
with
a
fearful
interest
the
movements
of
the
savages
we
have
now
no
longer
any
doubt
of
their
intention
to
remain
for
several
days
the
stakes
are
soon
erected
running
for
a
hundred
yards
or
more
along
the
front
of
the
encampment
the
savages
await
the
return
of
their
hunters
some
mount
and
scour
off
toward
the
scene
of
the
buffalo
battue
still
going
on
far
out
upon
the
plain
we
peer
through
the
leaves
with
great
caution
for
the
day
is
bright
and
the
eyes
of
our
enemies
are
quick
and
scan
every
object
we
speak
only
in
whispers
though
our
voices
could
not
be
heard
if
we
conversed
a
little
louder
but
fear
makes
us
fancy
that
they
might
we
are
all
concealed
except
our
eyes
these
glance
through
small
loopholes
in
the
foliage
the
indian
hunters
have
been
gone
about
two
hours
we
now
see
them
returning
over
the
prairie
in
straggling
parties
they
ride
slowly
back
each
brings
his
load
before
him
on
the
withers
of
his
horse
they
have
large
masses
of
red
flesh
freshly
skinned
and
smoking
some
carry
the
sides
and
quarters
others
the
the
tongue
the
heart
and
liver
the
wrapped
up
in
the
skins
of
the
slaughtered
animals
they
arrive
in
camp
and
fling
their
loads
to
the
ground
now
begins
a
scene
of
noise
and
confusion
the
savages
run
to
and
fro
whooping
chattering
laughing
and
dancing
they
draw
their
long
and
hew
off
broad
steaks
they
spit
them
over
the
blazing
fires
they
cut
out
the
they
tear
off
the
white
fat
and
stuff
the
boudins
they
split
the
brown
liver
eating
it
raw
they
break
the
shanks
with
their
tomahawks
and
delve
out
the
savoury
marrow
and
through
all
these
operations
they
whoop
and
chatter
and
laugh
and
dance
over
the
ground
like
so
many
madmen
this
scene
lasts
for
more
than
an
hour
fresh
parties
of
hunters
mount
and
ride
off
those
who
remain
cut
the
meat
into
long
thin
strips
and
hang
it
over
the
lines
already
prepared
for
this
purpose
it
is
thus
left
to
be
baked
by
the
sun
into
tasajo
we
know
part
of
what
is
before
us
it
is
a
fearful
prospect
but
men
like
those
who
compose
the
band
of
seguin
do
not
despond
while
the
shadow
of
a
hope
remains
it
is
a
barren
spot
indeed
where
they
can
not
find
resources
we
need
holler
till
we
hurt
says
one
of
the
hunters
if
yer
call
an
empty
belly
a
hurt
rejoins
another
i
got
it
already
i
kud
jest
eat
a
raw
jackass
skinnin
him
come
fellers
cries
a
third
let
gramble
for
a
meal
o
these
peenyuns
following
this
suggestion
we
commence
searching
for
the
nuts
of
the
pine
we
find
to
our
dismay
that
there
is
but
a
limited
supply
of
this
precious
food
not
enough
either
on
the
trees
or
the
ground
to
sustain
us
for
two
days
by
gosh
exclaims
one
we
have
to
draw
for
our
critters
well
and
if
we
have
to
time
enough
yet
a
bit
i
guess
we
bite
our
claws
a
while
first
the
water
is
distributed
in
a
small
cup
there
is
still
a
little
left
in
the
xuages
but
our
poor
horses
suffer
let
us
look
to
them
says
seguin
and
drawing
his
knife
he
commences
skinning
one
of
the
cacti
we
follow
his
example
we
carefully
pare
off
the
volutes
and
spikelets
a
cool
gummy
liquid
exudes
from
the
opened
vessels
we
break
the
short
stems
and
lifting
the
green
masses
carry
them
to
the
thicket
and
place
them
before
our
animals
these
seize
the
succulent
plants
greedily
crunch
them
between
their
teeth
and
swallow
both
sap
and
fibres
it
is
food
and
drink
to
them
thank
heaven
we
may
yet
save
them
this
act
is
repeated
several
times
until
they
have
had
enough
we
keep
two
videttes
constantly
on
the
one
upon
the
hill
the
other
commanding
the
mouth
of
the
defile
the
rest
of
us
go
through
the
ravine
along
the
sides
of
the
ridge
in
search
of
the
cones
of
the
pinon
thus
our
first
day
is
spent
the
indian
hunters
keep
coming
into
their
camp
until
a
late
hour
bringing
with
them
their
burdens
of
buffalo
flesh
fires
blaze
over
the
ground
and
the
savages
sit
around
them
cooking
and
eating
nearly
all
the
night
on
the
following
day
they
do
not
rouse
themselves
until
a
late
hour
it
is
a
day
of
lassitude
and
idleness
for
the
meat
is
hanging
over
the
strings
and
they
can
only
wait
upon
it
they
lounge
around
the
camp
mending
their
bridles
and
lassos
or
looking
to
their
weapons
they
lead
their
horses
to
the
water
and
then
picket
them
on
fresh
ground
they
cut
large
pieces
of
meat
and
broil
them
over
the
fires
hundreds
of
them
are
at
all
times
engaged
in
this
last
occupation
they
seem
to
eat
continually
their
dogs
are
busy
too
growling
over
the
bones
they
are
not
likely
to
leave
their
feast
they
will
not
stray
up
the
ravine
while
it
lasts
in
this
thought
we
find
consolation
the
sun
is
hot
all
the
second
day
and
scorches
us
in
the
dry
defile
it
adds
to
our
thirst
but
we
do
not
regret
this
so
much
knowing
it
will
hasten
the
departure
of
the
savages
towards
evening
the
tasajo
begins
to
look
brown
and
shrivelled
another
such
day
and
it
will
be
ready
for
packing
our
water
is
out
and
we
chew
the
succulent
slices
of
the
cactus
these
relieve
our
thirst
without
quenching
it
our
appetite
of
hunger
is
growing
stronger
we
have
eaten
all
the
pinons
and
nothing
remains
but
to
slaughter
one
of
our
horses
let
us
hold
out
till
suggests
one
give
the
poor
brutes
a
chance
who
knows
but
what
they
may
flit
in
the
morning
this
proposition
is
voted
in
the
affirmative
no
hunter
cares
to
risk
losing
his
horse
especially
when
out
upon
the
prairies
gnawed
by
hunger
we
lie
waiting
for
the
third
day
the
morning
breaks
at
last
and
we
crawl
forward
as
usual
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
camp
the
savages
sleep
late
as
on
yesterday
but
they
arouse
themselves
at
length
and
after
watering
their
animals
commence
cooking
we
see
the
crimson
streaks
and
the
juicy
ribs
smoking
over
the
fires
and
the
savoury
odours
are
wafted
to
us
on
the
breeze
our
appetites
are
whetted
to
a
painful
keenness
we
can
endure
no
longer
a
horse
must
die
whose
mountain
law
will
soon
decide
eleven
white
pebbles
and
a
black
one
are
thrown
into
the
and
one
by
one
we
are
blinded
and
led
forward
i
tremble
as
i
place
my
hand
in
the
vessel
it
is
like
throwing
the
die
for
my
own
life
thank
heaven
my
moro
is
safe
one
of
the
mexicans
has
drawn
the
black
thar
luck
in
that
exclaims
a
hunter
good
fat
mustang
better
than
poor
bull
any
day
the
devoted
horse
is
in
fact
a
animal
and
placing
our
videttes
again
we
proceed
to
the
thicket
to
slaughter
him
we
set
about
it
with
great
caution
we
tie
him
to
a
tree
and
hopple
his
fore
and
hind
feet
lest
he
may
struggle
we
propose
bleeding
him
to
death
the
cibolero
has
unsheathed
his
long
knife
while
a
man
stands
by
holding
the
bucket
to
catch
the
precious
fluid
the
blood
some
have
cups
in
their
hands
ready
to
drink
it
as
it
flows
we
were
startled
by
an
unusual
sound
we
look
through
the
leaves
a
large
grey
animal
is
standing
by
the
edge
of
the
thicket
gazing
in
at
us
it
is
is
it
a
wolf
no
it
is
an
indian
dog
the
knife
is
stayed
each
man
draws
his
own
we
approach
the
animal
and
endeavour
to
coax
it
nearer
but
no
it
suspects
our
intentions
utters
a
low
growl
and
runs
away
down
the
defile
we
follow
it
with
our
eyes
the
owner
of
the
doomed
horse
is
the
vidette
the
dog
must
pass
him
to
get
out
and
he
stands
with
his
long
lance
ready
to
receive
it
the
animal
sees
himself
intercepted
turns
and
runs
back
and
again
turning
makes
a
desperate
rush
to
pass
the
vidette
as
he
nears
the
latter
he
utters
a
loud
howl
the
next
moment
he
is
impaled
upon
the
lance
several
of
us
rush
up
the
hill
to
ascertain
if
the
howling
has
attracted
the
attention
of
the
savages
there
is
no
unusual
movement
among
them
they
have
not
heard
it
the
dog
is
divided
and
devoured
before
his
quivering
flesh
has
time
to
grow
cold
the
horse
is
reprieved
again
we
feed
our
animals
on
the
cooling
cactus
this
occupies
us
for
some
time
when
we
return
to
the
hill
a
glad
sight
is
before
us
we
see
the
warriors
seated
around
their
fires
renewing
the
paint
upon
their
bodies
we
know
the
meaning
of
this
the
tasajo
is
nearly
black
thanks
to
the
hot
sun
it
will
soon
be
ready
for
packing
some
of
the
indians
are
engaged
in
poisoning
the
points
of
their
arrows
all
these
signs
inspire
us
with
fresh
courage
they
will
soon
march
if
not
by
daybreak
on
the
morrow
we
lie
congratulating
ourselves
and
watching
every
movement
of
their
camp
our
hopes
continue
rising
as
the
day
falls
ha
there
is
an
unusual
stir
some
order
has
been
issued
voila
mira
mira
see
look
look
are
the
ejaculations
that
break
from
the
hunters
as
this
is
observed
by
the
livin
catamount
thar
to
mizzle
we
see
the
savages
pull
down
the
tasajo
and
tie
it
in
bunches
then
every
man
runs
out
for
his
horse
the
pickets
are
drawn
the
animals
are
led
in
and
watered
they
are
bridled
the
robes
are
thrown
over
them
and
girthed
the
warriors
pluck
up
their
lances
sling
their
quivers
seize
their
shields
and
bows
and
leap
lightly
upon
horseback
the
next
moment
they
form
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
and
wheeling
in
their
tracks
ride
off
in
single
file
heading
to
the
southward
the
larger
band
has
passed
the
smaller
the
navajoes
follow
in
the
same
trail
no
the
latter
has
suddenly
filed
to
the
left
and
is
crossing
the
prairie
towards
the
east
towards
the
spring
of
the
ojo
de
vaca
chapter
twenty
seven
the
diggers
our
first
impulse
was
to
rush
down
the
ravine
satisfy
our
thirst
at
the
spring
and
our
hunger
on
the
bones
that
were
strewed
over
the
prairie
prudence
however
restrained
us
wait
till
they
clar
gone
said
garey
they
be
out

yes
stay
where
we
are

bit
added
another
some
of
them
may
ride
back
something
may
be
forgotten
this
was
not
improbable
and
in
spite
of
the
promptings
of
our
appetites
we
resolved
to
remain
a
while
longer
in
the
defile
we
descended
straightway
into
the
thicket
to
make
preparations
for
moving
to
saddle
our
horses
and
take
off
their
mufflings
which
by
this
time
had
nearly
blinded
them
poor
brutes
they
seemed
to
know
that
relief
was
at
hand
while
we
were
engaged
in
these
operations
our
vidette
was
kept
at
the
top
of
the
hill
to
watch
both
bands
and
warn
us
when
their
heads
should
sink
to
the
prairie
level
i
wonder
why
the
navajoes
have
gone
by
the
ojo

remarked
our
chief
with
an
apparent
anxiety
in
his
manner
it
is
well
our
comrades
did
not
remain
there
they
be
tired

our
horses
were
at
length
bridled
and
saddled
and
our
lassoes
coiled
up
still
the
vidette

not
warned
us
we
grew
every
moment
more
impatient

heads
of
the
hindmost
that

cried
seguin
come
take
your
horses
the
men
obeyed
with
alacrity
and
we
all
moved
down
the
ravine
leading
our
animals
we
pressed
forward
to
the
opening
a
young
man
the
pueblo
servant
of
seguin
was
ahead
of
the
rest
he
was
impatient
to
reach
the
water
he
had
gained
the
mouth
of
the
defile
when
we
saw
him
fall
back
with
frightening
looks
dragging
at
his
horse
and
exclaiming
mi
amo
mi
amo
to
davia
son
master
master
they
are
here
yet
who
inquired
seguin
running
forward
in
haste
the
indians
master
the
indians
you
are
mad
where
did
you
see
them
in
the
camp
master
look
yonder
i
pressed
forward
with
seguin
to
the
rocks
that
lay
along
the
entrance
of
the
defile
we
looked
cautiously
over
a
singular
sight
met
our
eyes
the
was
lying
as
the
indians
had
left
it
the
stakes
were
still
standing
the
shaggy
hides
of
the
buffaloes
and
pile
of
their
bones
were
strewn
upon
the
plain
hundreds
of
coyotes
were
loping
back
and
forward
snarling
at
one
another
or
pursuing
one
of
their
number
which
had
picked
up
a
nicer
morsel
than
his
companions
the
fires
were
still
smouldering
and
the
wolves
galloped
through
the
ashes
raising
them
in
yellow
clouds
but
there
was
a
sight
stranger
than
all
this
a
startling
sight
to
me
five
or
six
forms
almost
human
were
moving
about
among
the
fires
collecting
the
debris
of
skins
and
bones
and
quarrelling
with
the
wolves
that
barked
round
them
in
troops
five
or
six
others
similar
forms
were
seated
around
a
pile
of
burning
wood
silently
gnawing
at
half
roasted
ribs
can
they
be
yes
they
are
human
beings
i
was
for
a
moment
as
i
gazed
at
the
shrivelled
and
dwarfish
bodies
the
long
arms
and
huge
disproportioned
heads
from
which
fell
their
hair
in
snaky
tangles
black
and
matted
but
one
or
two
appeared
to
have
any
article
of
dress
and
that
was
a
ragged
the
others
were
naked
as
the
wild
beasts
around
them
naked
from
head
to
foot
it
was
a
horrid
sight
to
look
upon
these
dwarfs
squatted
around
the
fires
holding
up
bones
in
their
long
wrinkled
arms
and
tearing
off
the
flesh
with
their
glistening
teeth
it
was
a
horrid
sight
indeed
and
it
was
some
moments
before
i
could
recover
sufficiently
from
my
amazement
to
inquire
who
or
what
they
were
i
did
so
at
length
los
yamparicos
answered
the
cibolero
who
i
asked
again
los
indios
yamparicos
senor
the
diggers
the
diggers
said
a
hunter
thinking
that
would
better
explain
the
strange
apparitions
yes
they
are
digger
indians
added
seguin
come
on
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
but
we
have
somethin
to
git
from
them
rejoined
one
of
the
hunters
with
a
significant
look
digger
plew
good
as
any
other
worth
jest
as
much
as
chief
no
one
must
fire
said
seguin
in
a
firm
tone
it
is
too
soon
yet
look
yonder
and
he
pointed
over
the
plain
where
two
or
three
glancing
objects
the
helmets
of
the
retreating
warriors
could
still
be
seen
above
the
grass
how
are
we
goin
to
get
them
then
captain
inquired
the
hunter
they
beat
us
to
the
rocks
they
kin
run
like
scared
dogs
better
let
them
go
poor
devils
said
seguin
seemingly
unwilling
that
blood
should
be
spilled
so
wantonly
no
captain
rejoined
the
same
speaker
we
wo
fire
but
we
git
them
if
we
kin
it
boys
follow
me
down
this
way
and
the
man
was
about
guiding
his
horse
in
among
the
loose
rocks
so
as
to
pass
unperceived
between
the
dwarfs
and
the
mountain
but
the
brutal
fellow
was
frustrated
in
his
design
for
at
that
moment
el
sol
and
his
sister
appeared
in
the
opening
and
their
brilliant
habiliments
caught
the
eyes
of
the
diggers
like
startled
deer
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
ran
or
rather
flew
toward
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
hunters
galloped
to
intercept
them
but
they
were
too
late
before
they
could
come
up
the
diggers
had
dived
into
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
or
were
seen
climbing
like
chamois
along
the
cliffs
far
out
of
reach
one
of
the
hunters
only
sanchez
succeeded
in
making
a
capture
his
victim
had
reached
a
high
ledge
and
was
scrambling
along
it
when
the
lasso
of
the
settled
round
his
neck
the
next
moment
he
was
plucked
out
into
the
air
and
fell
with
a
cranch
upon
the
rocks
i
rode
forward
to
look
at
him
he
was
dead
he
had
been
crushed
by
the
fall
in
fact
mangled
to
a
shapeless
mass
and
exhibited
a
most
loathsome
and
hideous
sight
the
unfeeling
hunter
recked
not
of
this
with
a
coarse
jest
he
stooped
over
the
body
and
severing
the
scalp
stuck
it
reeking
and
bloody
behind
the
waist
of
his
calzoneros
chapter
twenty
eight
dacoma
we
all
now
hurried
forward
to
the
spring
and
dismounting
turned
our
horses
heads
to
the
water
leaving
them
to
drink
at
will
we
had
no
fear
of
their
running
away
our
own
thirst
required
slaking
as
much
as
theirs
and
crowding
into
the
branch
we
poured
the
cold
water
down
our
throats
in
cupfuls
we
felt
as
though
we
should
never
be
surfeited
but
another
appetite
equally
strong
lured
us
away
from
the
spring
and
we
ran
over
the
in
search
of
the
means
to
gratify
it
we
scattered
the
coyotes
and
white
wolves
with
our
shouts
and
drove
them
with
missiles
from
the
ground
we
were
about
stooping
to
pick
up
the
morsels
when
a
strange
exclamation
from
one
of
the
hunters
caused
us
to
look
hastily
round
malaray
camarados
mira
el
arco
the
mexican
who
uttered
these
words
stood
pointing
to
an
object
that
lay
upon
the
ground
at
his
feet
we
ran
up
to
ascertain
what
it
was
caspita
again
ejaculated
the
man
it
is
a
white
bow
a
white
bow
by
gosh
echoed
garey
a
white
bow
shouted
several
others
eyeing
the
object
with
looks
of
astonishment
and
alarm
that
belonged
to
a
big
warrior
i
sartify
said
garey
ay
added
another
an
one
that
ride
back
for
it
as
soon
as
holies
look
yonder
he
coming
by
our
eyes
rolled
over
the
prairie
together
eastward
as
the
speaker
pointed
an
object
was
just
visible
low
down
on
the
horizon
like
a
moving
blazing
star
it
was
not
that
at
a
glance
we
all
knew
what
it
was
it
was
a
helmet
flashing
under
the
sunbeam
as
it
rose
and
fell
to
the
measured
gallop
of
a
horse
to
the
willows
men
to
the
willows
shouted
seguin
drop
the
bow
leave
it
where
it
was
to
your
horses
lead
them
crouch
crouch
we
all
ran
to
our
horses
and
seizing
the
bridles
them
within
the
willow
thicket
we
leaped
into
our
saddles
so
as
to
be
ready
for
any
emergency
and
sat
peering
through
the
leaves
that
screened
us
shall
we
fire
as
he
comes
up
captain
asked
one
of
the
men
no
we
kin
take
him
nicely
just
as
he
stoops
for
the
bow
no
not
for
your
lives
what
then
captain
let
him
take
it
and
go
was
seguin
reply
why
captain
what
that
for
fools
do
you
not
see
that
the
whole
tribe
would
be
back
upon
our
trail
before
midnight
are
you
mad
let
him
go
he
may
not
notice
our
tracks
as
our
horses
are
not
shod
if
so
let
him
go
as
he
came
i
tell
you
but
how
captain
if
he
squints
garey
as
he
said
this
pointed
to
the
rocks
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
digger
exclaimed
seguin
his
countenance
changing
expression
the
body
lay
on
a
conspicuous
point
on
its
face
the
crimson
skull
turned
upward
and
outward
so
that
it
could
hardly
fail
to
attract
the
eye
of
anyone
coming
in
from
the
plain
several
coyotes
had
already
climbed
up
on
the
slab
where
it
lay
and
were
smelling
around
it
seemingly
not
caring
to
touch
the
hideous
morsel
he
bound
to
see
it
captain
added
the
hunter
if
so
we
must
take
him
with
the
lance
the
lasso
or
alive
no
gun
must
be
fired
they
might
still
hear
it
and
would
be
on
us
before
we
could
get
round
the
mountain
no
sling
your
guns
let
those
who
have
lances
and
lassoes
get
them
in
readiness
when
would
you
have
us
make
the
dash
captain
leave
that
to
me
perhaps
he
may
dismount
for
the
bow
or
if
not
he
may
ride
into
the
spring
to
water
his
horse
then
we
can
surround
him
if
he
see
the
digger
body
he
may
pass
up
to
examine
it
more
closely
in
that
case
we
can
intercept
him
without
difficulty
be
patient
i
shall
give
you
the
signal
during
all
this
time
the
navajo
was
coming
up
at
a
regular
gallop
as
the
dialogue
ended
he
had
got
within
about
three
hundred
yards
of
the
spring
and
still
pressed
forward
without
slackening
his
pace
we
kept
our
gaze
fixed
upon
him
in
breathless
silence
eyeing
both
man
and
horse
it
was
a
splendid
sight
the
horse
was
a
large
mustang
with
fiery
eyes
and
red
open
nostrils
he
was
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
the
white
flakes
had
clouted
his
throat
counter
and
shoulders
he
was
wet
all
over
and
glittered
as
he
moved
with
the
play
of
his
proud
flanks
the
rider
was
naked
from
the
waist
up
excepting
his
helmet
and
plumes
and
some
ornaments
that
glistened
on
his
neck
bosom
and
wrists
a
skirt
bright
and
embroidered
covered
his
hips
and
thighs
below
the
knee
his
legs
were
naked
ending
in
a
buskined
moccasin
that
fitted
tightly
round
the
ankle
unlike
the
apaches
there
was
no
paint
upon
his
body
and
his
bronze
complexion
shone
with
the
hue
of
health
his
features
were
noble
and
warlike
his
eye
bold
and
piercing
and
his
long
black
hair
swept
away
behind
him
mingling
with
the
tail
of
his
horse
he
rode
upon
a
spanish
saddle
with
his
lance
poised
on
the
stirrup
and
resting
lightly
against
his
right
arm
his
left
was
thrust
through
the
strap
of
a
white
shield
and
a
quiver
with
its
feathered
shafts
peeped
over
his
shoulder
his
bow
was
before
him
it
was
a
splendid
sight
both
horse
and
rider
as
they
rose
together
over
the
green
swells
of
the
prairie
a
picture
more
like
that
of
some
homeric
hero
than
a
savage
of
the
wild
west
wagh
exclaimed
one
of
the
hunters
in
an
undertone
how
they
glitter
look
at
that
headpiece
it
fairly
ay
rejoined
garey
we
may
thank
the
piece
o
brass
we
have
been
in
as
ugly
a
fix
as
he
in
now
if
we
had
sighted
it
in
time
what
continued
the
trapper
his
voice
rising
into
earnestness
dacoma
by
the
etarnal
the
second
chief
of
the
navajoes
i
turned
toward
seguin
to
witness
the
effect
of
this
announcement
the
maricopa
was
leaning
over
to
him
muttering
some
words
in
an
unknown
tongue
and
gesticulating
with
energy
i
recognised
the
name
dacoma
and
there
was
an
expression
of
fierce
hatred
in
the
chief
countenance
as
he
pointed
to
the
advancing
horseman
well
then
answered
seguin
apparently
assenting
to
the
wishes
of
the
other
he
shall
not
escape
whether
he
sees
it
or
no
but
do
not
use
your
gun
they
are
not
ten
miles
off
yonder
behind
the
swell
we
can
easily
surround
him
if
not
i
can
overtake
him
on
this
horse
and
here
another
as
seguin
uttered
the
last
speech
he
pointed
to
moro
silence
he
continued
lowering
his
voice
the
silence
became
each
man
sat
pressing
his
horse
with
his
knees
as
if
thus
to
hold
him
at
rest
the
navajo
had
now
reached
the
border
of
the
deserted
camp
and
inclining
to
the
left
he
galloped
down
the
line
scattering
the
wolves
as
he
went
he
sat
leaning
to
one
side
his
gaze
searching
the
ground
when
nearly
opposite
to
our
ambush
he
descried
the
object
of
his
search
and
sliding
his
feet
out
of
the
stirrup
guided
his
horse
so
as
to
shave
closely
past
it
then
without
reining
in
or
even
slacking
his
pace
he
bent
over
until
his
plume
swept
the
earth
and
picking
up
the
bow
swung
himself
back
into
the
saddle
beautiful
exclaimed
the
by
gosh
it
a
pity
to
kill
him
muttered
a
hunter
and
a
low
murmur
of
admiration
was
heard
among
the
men
after
a
few
more
springs
the
indian
suddenly
wheeled
and
was
about
to
gallop
back
when
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
ensanguined
object
upon
the
rock
he
reined
in
with
a
jerk
until
the
hips
of
his
horse
almost
rested
upon
the
prairie
and
sat
gazing
upon
the
body
with
a
look
of
surprise
beautiful
again
exclaimed
sanchez
carambo
beautiful
it
was
in
effect
as
fine
a
picture
as
ever
the
eye
looked
upon
the
horse
with
his
tail
scattered
upon
the
ground
with
crest
erect
and
breathing
nostril
quivering
under
the
impulse
of
his
masterly
rider
the
rider
himself
with
his
glancing
helmet
and
waving
plumes
his
bronze
complexion
his
firm
and
graceful
seat
and
his
eye
fixed
in
the
gaze
of
wonder
it
was
as
sanchez
had
said
a
beautiful
picture
a
living
statue
and
all
of
us
were
filled
with
admiration
as
we
looked
upon
it
not
one
of
the
party
with
perhaps
an
exception
should
have
liked
to
fire
the
shot
that
would
have
tumbled
it
from
its
pedestal
horse
and
man
remained
in
this
attitude
for
some
moments
then
the
expression
of
the
rider
countenance
suddenly
changed
his
eye
wandered
with
an
inquiring
and
somewhat
terrified
look
it
rested
upon
the
water
still
muddy
with
the
trampling
of
our
horses
one
glance
was
sufficient
and
with
a
quick
strong
jerk
upon
the
bridle
the
savage
horseman
wheeled
and
struck
out
for
the
prairie
our
charging
signal
had
been
given
at
the
same
instant
and
springing
forward
we
shot
out
of
the
in
a
body
we
had
to
cross
the
rivulet
seguin
was
some
paces
in
advance
as
we
rode
forward
to
it
i
saw
his
horse
suddenly
baulk
stumble
over
the
bank
and
roll
headlong
into
the
water
the
rest
of
us
went
splashing
through
i
did
not
stop
to
look
back
i
knew
that
now
the
taking
of
the
indian
was
life
or
death
to
all
of
us
and
i
struck
my
spur
deeply
and
strained
forward
in
the
pursuit
for
some
time
we
all
rode
together
in
a
dense
clump
when
fairly
out
on
the
plain
we
saw
the
indian
ahead
of
us
about
a
dozen
lengths
of
his
horse
and
one
and
all
felt
with
dismay
that
he
was
keeping
his
distance
if
not
actually
increasing
it
we
had
forgotten
the
condition
of
our
animals
they
were
faint
with
hunger
and
stiff
from
standing
so
long
in
the
ravine
moreover
they
had
just
drunk
to
a
surfeit
i
soon
found
that
i
was
forging
ahead
of
my
companions
the
superior
swiftness
of
moro
gave
me
the
advantage
el
sol
was
still
before
me
i
saw
him
circling
his
lasso
i
saw
him
launch
it
and
suddenly
jerk
up
i
saw
the
loop
sliding
over
the
hips
of
the
flying
mustang
he
had
missed
his
aim
he
was
recoiling
the
rope
as
i
shot
past
him
and
i
noticed
his
look
of
chagrin
and
disappointment
my
arab
had
now
warmed
to
the
chase
and
i
was
soon
far
ahead
of
my
comrades
i
perceived
too
that
i
was
closing
upon
the
navajo
every
spring
brought
me
nearer
until
there
were
not
a
dozen
lengths
between
us
i
knew
not
how
to
act
i
held
my
rifle
in
my
hands
and
could
have
shot
the
indian
in
the
back
but
i
remembered
the
injunction
of
seguin
and
we
were
now
closer
to
the
enemy
than
ever
i
did
not
know
but
that
we
might
be
in
sight
of
them
i
dared
not
fire
i
was
still
undecided
whether
to
use
my
knife
or
endeavour
to
unhorse
the
indian
with
my
clubbed
rifle
when
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
that
i
was
alone
suddenly
he
wheeled
and
throwing
his
lance
to
a
charge
came
galloping
back
his
horse
seemed
to
work
without
the
rein
obedient
to
his
voice
and
the
touch
of
his
knees
i
had
just
time
to
throw
up
my
rifle
and
parry
the
charge
which
was
a
right
point
i
did
not
parry
it
successfully
the
blade
grazed
my
arm
tearing
my
flesh
the
barrel
of
my
rifle
caught
in
the
sling
of
the
lance
and
the
piece
was
whipped
out
of
my
hands
the
wound
the
shock
and
the
loss
of
my
weapon
had
discomposed
me
in
the
manage
of
my
horse
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
gain
the
bridle
to
turn
him
my
antagonist
had
wheeled
sooner
as
i
knew
by
the
hist
of
an
arrow
that
scattered
the
curls
over
my
right
ear
as
i
faced
him
again
another
was
on
the
string
and
the
next
moment
it
was
sticking
through
my
left
arm
i
was
now
angry
and
drawing
a
pistol
from
the
holster
i
cocked
it
and
galloped
forward
i
knew
it
was
the
only
chance
for
my
life
the
indian
at
the
same
time
dropped
his
bow
and
bringing
his
lance
to
the
charge
spurred
on
to
meet
me
i
was
determined
not
to
fire
until
near
and
sure
of
hitting
we
closed
at
full
gallop
our
horses
almost
touched
i
levelled
and
pulled
trigger
the
cap
snapped
upon
my
pistol
the
glittered
in
my
eyes
its
point
was
at
my
breast
something
struck
me
sharply
in
the
face
it
was
the
of
a
lasso
i
saw
it
settle
over
the
shoulders
of
the
indian
falling
to
his
elbows
it
tightened
as
it
fell
there
was
a
wild
yell
a
quick
jerk
of
my
antagonist
body
the
lance
flew
from
his
hands
and
the
next
moment
he
was
plucked
out
of
his
saddle
and
lying
helpless
upon
the
prairie
his
horse
met
mine
with
a
concussion
that
sent
both
of
them
to
the
earth
we
rolled
and
scrambled
about
and
rose
again
when
i
came
to
my
feet
el
sol
was
standing
over
the
navajo
with
his
knife
drawn
and
his
lasso
looped
around
the
arms
of
his
captive
the
horse
the
horse
secure
the
horse
shouted
seguin
as
he
galloped
up
and
the
crowd
dashed
past
me
in
pursuit
of
the
mustang
which
with
trailing
bridle
was
scouring
over
the
prairie
in
a
few
minutes
the
animal
was
lassoed
and
led
back
to
the
spot
so
near
being
made
sacred
with
my
grave
chapter
twenty
nine
a
dinner
with
two
dishes
el
sol
i
have
said
was
standing
over
the
prostrate
indian
his
countenance
indicated
the
blending
of
two
emotions
hate
and
triumph
his
sister
at
this
moment
galloped
up
and
leaping
from
her
horse
advanced
rapidly
forward
behold
said
he
pointing
to
the
navajo
chief
behold
the
murderer
of
our
mother
the
girl
uttered
a
short
sharp
exclamation
and
drawing
a
knife
rushed
upon
the
captive
no
luna
cried
el
sol
putting
her
aside
no
we
are
not
assassins
that
is
not
revenge
he
shall
not
yet
die
we
will
show
him
alive
to
the
squaws
of
the
maricopa
they
shall
dance
the
mamanchic
over
this
great
chief
this
warrior
captured
without
a
wound
el
sol
uttered
these
words
in
a
contemptuous
tone
the
effect
was
visible
on
the
navajo
dog
of
a
coco
cried
he
making
an
involuntary
struggle
to
free
himself
dog
of
a
coco
leagued
with
the
pale
robbers
dog
ha
you
remember
me
dacoma
it
is
well
dog
again
ejaculated
the
navajo
interrupting
him
and
the
words
hissed
through
his
teeth
while
his
eyes
glared
with
an
expression
of
the
fiercest
malignity
he
he
cried
rube
at
this
moment
galloping
up
he
he
that
as
savagerous
as
a
meat
axe
lamm
him
warm
his
collops
wi
the
bull
rope
he
warmed
my
old
mar
nick
syrup
him
let
us
look
to
your
wound
monsieur
haller
said
seguin
alighting
from
his
horse
and
approaching
me
as
i
thought
with
an
uneasiness
of
manner
how
is
it
through
the
flesh
you
are
safe
enough
if
indeed
the
arrow
has
not
been
poisoned
i
tear
el
sol
here
quick
my
friend
tell
me
if
this
point
has
been
dipped
let
us
first
take
it
out
replied
the
maricopa
coming
up
we
shall
lose
no
time
by
that
the
arrow
was
sticking
through
my
forearm
the
barb
had
pierced
through
the
flesh
until
about
half
of
the
shaft
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
el
sol
caught
the
feather
end
in
both
his
hands
and
snapped
it
at
the
lapping
he
then
took
hold
of
the
barb
and
drew
it
gently
out
of
the
wound
let
it
bleed
said
he
till
i
have
examined
the
point
it
does
not
look
like
a
but
the
navajoes
use
a
very
subtle
poison
fortunately
i
possess
the
means
of
detecting
it
as
well
as
its
antidote
as
he
said
this
he
took
from
his
pouch
a
tuft
of
raw
cotton
with
this
he
rubbed
the
blood
lightly
from
the
blade
he
then
drew
forth
a
small
stone
phial
and
pouring
a
few
drops
of
liquid
upon
the
metal
watched
the
result
i
waited
with
no
slight
feeling
of
uneasiness
seguin
too
appeared
anxious
and
as
i
knew
that
he
must
have
oftentimes
witnessed
the
effect
of
a
poisoned
arrow
i
did
not
feel
very
comfortable
seeing
him
watch
the
assaying
process
with
so
much
apparent
anxiety
i
knew
there
was
danger
where
he
dreaded
it
monsieur
haller
said
el
sol
at
length
you
are
in
luck
this
time
i
think
i
may
call
it
luck
for
your
antagonist
has
surely
some
in
his
quiver
not
quite
so
harmless
as
this
one
let
me
see
he
added
and
stepping
up
to
the
navajo
he
drew
another
arrow
from
the
quiver
that
still
remained
slung
upon
the
indian
back
after
subjecting
the
blade
to
a
similar
test
he
exclaimed
i
told
you
so
look
at
this
green
as
a
plantain
he
fired
two
where
is
the
other
comrades
help
me
to
find
it
such
a
as
that
must
not
be
left
behind
us
several
of
the
men
leaped
from
their
horses
and
searched
for
the
shaft
that
had
been
shot
first
i
pointed
out
the
direction
and
probable
distance
as
near
as
i
could
and
in
a
few
moments
it
was
picked
up
el
sol
took
it
and
poured
a
few
drops
of
his
liquid
on
the
blade
it
turned
green
like
the
other
you
may
thank
your
saints
monsieur
haller
said
the
coco
it
was
not
this
one
made
that
hole
in
your
arm
else
it
would
have
taken
all
the
skill
of
doctor
reichter
and
myself
to
have
saved
you
but
what
this
another
wound
ha
he
touched
you
as
he
made
his
right
point
let
me
look
at
it
i
think
it
is
only
a
scratch
this
is
a
strange
climate
monsieur
haller
i
have
seen
scratches
become
mortal
wounds
when
not
sufficiently
valued
luna
some
cotton
sis
i
shall
endeavour
to
dress
yours
so
that
you
need
not
fear
that
result
you
deserve
that
much
at
my
hands
but
for
you
sir
he
would
have
escaped
me
but
for
you
sir
he
would
have
killed
me
well
replied
the
coco
with
a
smile
it
is
possible
you
would
not
have
come
off
so
well
your
weapon
played
you
false
it
is
hardly
just
to
expect
a
man
to
parry
a
with
a
clubbed
rifle
though
it
was
beautifully
done
i
do
not
wonder
that
you
pulled
trigger
in
the
second
joust
i
intended
doing
so
myself
had
the
lasso
failed
me
again
but
we
are
in
luck
both
ways
you
must
sling
this
arm
for
a
day
or
two
luna
that
scarf
of
yours
no
said
i
as
the
girl
proceeded
to
unfasten
a
beautiful
scarf
which
she
wore
around
her
waist
you
shall
not
i
will
find
something
else
here
mister
if
this
will
do
interposed
the
young
trapper
garey
you
are
heartily
welcome
to
it
as
garey
said
this
he
pulled
a
coloured
handkerchief
out
of
the
breast
of
his
and
held
it
forth
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
i
replied
although
i
knew
on
whose
account
the
kerchief
was
given
you
will
be
pleased
to
accept
this
in
return
and
i
offered
him
one
of
my
small
revolvers
a
weapon
that
at
that
time
and
in
that
place
was
worth
its
weight
in
pearls
the
mountain
man
knew
this
and
very
gratefully
accepted
the
proffered
gift
but
much
as
he
might
have
prized
it
i
saw
that
he
was
still
more
gratified
with
a
simple
smile
that
he
received
from
another
quarter
and
i
felt
certain
that
the
scarf
would
soon
change
owners
at
any
rate
i
watched
the
countenance
of
el
sol
to
see
if
he
had
noticed
or
approved
of
this
little
i
could
perceive
no
unusual
emotion
upon
it
he
was
busy
with
my
wounds
which
he
dressed
in
a
manner
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
member
of
the
now
said
he
when
he
had
finished
you
will
be
ready
for
as
much
more
fighting
in
a
couple
of
days
at
the
furthest
you
have
a
bad
monsieur
haller
but
the
best
horse
i
ever
saw
i
do
not
wonder
at
your
refusing
to
sell
him
most
of
the
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
english
and
it
was
spoken
by
the
coco
chief
with
an
accent
and
emphasis
to
my
ear
as
good
as
i
had
ever
heard
he
spoke
french
too
like
a
parisian
and
it
was
in
this
language
that
he
usually
conversed
with
seguin
i
wondered
at
all
this
the
men
had
remounted
with
the
intention
of
returning
to
the
camp
extreme
hunger
was
now
prompting
us
and
we
commenced
riding
back
to
partake
of
the
repast
so
unceremoniously
interrupted
at
a
short
distance
from
the
camp
we
dismounted
and
picketing
our
horses
upon
the
grass
walked
forward
to
search
for
the
stray
steaks
and
ribs
we
had
lately
seen
in
plenty
a
new
chagrin
awaited
us
not
a
morsel
of
flesh
remained
the
coyotes
had
taken
advantage
of
our
absence
and
we
could
see
nothing
around
us
but
naked
bones
the
thighs
and
ribs
of
the
buffaloes
had
been
polished
as
if
scraped
with
a
knife
even
the
hideous
carcass
of
the
digger
had
become
a
shining
skeleton
wagh
exclaimed
one
of
the
hunters
wolf
now
or
nothing
hyar
goes
and
the
man
levelled
his
rifle
hold
exclaimed
seguin
seeing
the
act
are
you
mad
sir
i
reckon
not
replied
the
hunter
doggedly
bringing
down
his
piece
we
must
eat
i
i
see
nothin
but
them
about
an
how
are
we
goin
to
get
them
shootin
seguin
made
no
reply
except
by
pointing
to
the
bow
which
el
sol
was
making
ready
added
the
hunter
yer
right
i
asks
pardon
i
had
forgot
that
piece
o
bone
the
coco
took
an
arrow
from
the
quiver
and
tried
the
head
with
the
assaying
liquid
it
proved
to
be
a
and
adjusting
it
to
the
string
he
sent
it
through
the
body
of
a
white
wolf
killing
it
instantly
he
took
up
the
shaft
again
and
wiping
the
feather
shot
another
and
another
until
the
bodies
of
five
or
six
of
these
animals
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
kill
a
coyote
when
ye
about
it
shouted
one
of
the
hunters
gentlemen
like
we
oughter
have
leastwise
two
courses
to
our
dinner
the
men
laughed
at
this
rough
sally
and
el
sol
smiling
again
picked
up
the
arrow
and
sent
it
whizzing
through
the
body
of
one
of
the
coyotes
i
think
that
will
be
enough
for
one
meal
at
all
events
said
el
sol
recovering
the
arrow
and
putting
it
back
into
the
quiver
ay
replied
the
wit
if
we
wants
more
we
kin
go
back
to
the
larder
agin
it
a
kind
o
meat
that
eats
better
fresh
anyhow
well
it
diz
hoss
wagh
i
in
for
a
griskin
o
the
white
hyar
goes
the
hunters
laughing
at
the
humour
of
their
comrades
drew
their
shining
knives
and
set
about
skinning
the
wolves
the
adroitness
with
which
this
operation
was
performed
showed
that
it
was
by
no
means
new
to
them
in
a
short
time
the
animals
were
stripped
of
their
hides
and
quarters
and
each
man
taking
his
quarter
commenced
roasting
it
over
the
fire
fellers
what
d
call
this
anyhow
beef
or
mutton
asked
one
as
they
began
to
eat
i
reckin
was
the
reply
it
good
eatin
i
say
peels
off
as
tender
as
squ
it
like
goat
ai
it
mine
tastes
more
like
dog
to
me
it
ai
bad
at
all
better
than
poor
bull
any
day
i
like
it
a
heap
better
if
i
war
sure
the
thing
had
been
up
to
yon
varmint
on
the
rocks
and
the
man
who
said
this
pointed
to
the
skeleton
of
the
digger
the
idea
was
horrible
and
under
other
circumstances
would
have
acted
as
a
sufficient
emetic
wagh
exclaimed
a
hunter
ye
most
taken
away
my
stammuck
i
was
to
try
the
coyoat

this
was
addressed
to
rube
who
was
busy
on
his
rib
and
made
no

said
another
answering
for
him

one
of
the
hunters
in
answer
to
rube
question
a
the
meanest
thing
i
ever
set
teeth
on
i
chawed
raw
at
that

for
what
i

the
contrairywise
but
oncest
on
a
time
this
niggur
chawed
a
varmint
that
much
sweeter
if
it
wur
as
sweet
what
was
it
rube
what
was
it
asked
several
in
a
breath
curious
to
know
what
the
old
trapper
could
have
eaten
more
unpalatable
than
the
viands
already
named
then
that
what
it
wur
echoed
everyone
any
thin
else
wagh
that
was
a
stinkin
pill
an
no
mistake
that
beats
me
all
hollow
and
when
did
ye
eat
the
buzzard
old
boy
asked
one
suspecting
that
there
might
be
a
story
connected
with
this
feat
of
the
earless
trapper
ay
tell
us
that
rube
tell

cried
several
wal
commenced
rube
after

the
speaker
with
a
chuckle
he
he
they

a
hunter
like
they
made
much
out
o
that
speckelashun

about
the
buzzard
see
i
wur
cleaned
out

i
never

they
wud
been
if

but
there
a
critter
from
the
minners
in
the
waters
to
the
bufflers
on
the
paraira
that
did
look
like
they
knowed
how
this

i
kud

nuthin
for
two
days
but
lizard
an
scarce

that

jeint
fat
cow

and
rube
as
he
said
this
made
a
fresh
attack
upon
the
i
chawed
up
the
ole
leggins
till
i
wur
as
naked
as
chimley
rock
gollies
was
it
winter
no
an
warm
enuf
for
that
matter
i
did
mind
the
want
o
the
buckskin
that
a
way
but
i
kud
eat
more
o
it
the
third
day
i
struck
a
town
o
this
niggur
har
wur
longer
then
than
it
ur
now
i
made
snares
o
it
an
trapped
a
lot
the
rats
but
they
grew
shy
too
cuss
an
i
had
to
quit
that
this
wur
the
third
day
from
the
time
i
been
set
down
an
i
wur
getting
nasty
weak
on
it
i
to
think
that
the
time
wur
come
for
this
child
to
go
under
a
leetle
arter
an
i
wur
sittin
on
the
bank
when
i
seed
somethin
queery
floatin
the
river
when
i
kim
closer
i
seed
it
wur
the
karkidge
o
a
buffler
calf
at
that
an
a
couple
o
buzzarts
floppin
about
on
the
thing
pickin
its
peepers
out
far
out
an
the
water
deep
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
fetch
it
ashore
i
long
in
strippin
i
reckin
here
the
hunters
interrupted
rube
story
with
a
laugh
i
tuk
the
water
an
swam
out
i
kud
smell
the
thing
afore
i
wur
an
when
i
got
near
it
the
birds
mizzled
i
wur
soon
clost
up
an
seed
at
a
glimp
that
the
calf
wur
as
rotten
as
punk
what
a
pity
exclaimed
one
of
the
hunters
i
to
have
my
swim
for
nuthin
so
i
tuk
the
tail
in
my
teeth
an
swam
back
for
the
shore
i
had
made
three
strokes
till
the
tail
pulled
out
i
then
swum
round
ahint
the
karkidge
an
pushed
it
afore
me
till
i
got
it
landed
high
an
dry
upon
a
sandbar
like
to
fall
to
pieces
when
i
pulled
it
out
o
the
water
eatable
nohow
here
rube
took
a
fresh
mouthful
of
the
and
remained
silent
until
he
had
masticated
it
the
men
had
become
interested
in
the
story
and
waited
with
impatience
at
length
he
proceeded
i
seed
the
buzzarts
still
flyin
about
an
fresh
ones
i
tuk
a
idee
that
i
mout
git
my
claws
upon
some
o
so
i
lay
down
clost
up
agin
the
calf
an
played
i
long
that
a
way
when
the
birds
begun
to
light
on
the
sandbar
an
a
big
cock
kim
floppin
up
to
the
karkidge
afore
he
kud
flop
up
agin
i
grupped
him
by
the
legs
hooraw
well
done
by
gollies
the
cussed
thing
wur
nearly
as
stinkin
as
but
it
wur
die
dog
buzzart
or
calf
so
i
skinned
the
buzzart
and
ate
it
inquired
an
impatient
listener
slowly
drawled
rube
apparently
miffed
at
being
thus
interrupted
it
ate
me
the
laugh
that
followed
this
retort
restored
the
old
trapper
to
good
humour
again
did
you
go
it
raw
rube
asked
one
of
the
hunters
how
could
he
do
otherwise
he
had
a
spark
o
fire
an
nothing
to
make
one
out
of
etarnal
fool
exclaimed
rube
turning
savagely
on
the
last
speaker
i
kud
make
a
fire
if
thur
a
spark
anywhar
a
yell
of
laughter
followed
this
speech
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
the
trapper
recovered
his
temper
sufficiently
to
resume
his
narration
the
rest
o
the
birds
continued
he
at
length
seein
the
ole
cock
rubbed
out
grew
shy
and
kep
away
on
side
o
the
river
no
use
tryin
that
dodge
over
agin
jest
then
i
spied
a
coyoat
comin
lopin
down
the
bank
an
another
follerin
upon
his
heels
two
or
three
more
on
the
same
trail
i
know
it
wud

these
hyur
nicks

standin
and
the
trapper
pointed
to
a
row
of
small
notches
cut
in
the
stock
of
his
rifle
ay
ay
cried
several
men
in
reply
thur
five
o
ai
thur
one
two
three
yes
five
them
rapahoes
rube
story
was
ended
chapter
thirty
blinding
the
pursuer
by
this
time
the
men
had
finished
eating
and
now
began
to
gather
around
seguin
for
the
purpose
of
deliberating
on
what
course
we
should
pursue
one
had
already
been
sent
up
to
the
rocks
to
act
as
a
vidette
and
warn
us
in
case
any
of
the
indians
should
be
descried
upon
the
prairie
we
all
felt
that
we
were
still
in
a
dilemma
the
navajo
was
our
captive
and
his
men
would
come
to
seek
for
him
he
was
too
important
a
personage
second
chief
of
the
nation
to
be
abandoned
without
a
search
and
his
own
followers
nearly
half
of
the
tribe
would
certainly
be
back
to
the
spring
not
finding
him
there
should
they
not
discover
our
tracks
they
would
return
upon
the
to
their
country
this
we
all
saw
would
render
our
expedition
impracticable
as
band
alone
outnumbered
us
and
should
we
meet
them
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
we
should
have
no
chance
of
escape
for
some
time
seguin
remained
silent
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
he
was
evidently
tracing
out
in
his
mind
some
plan
of
action
none
of
the
hunters
chose
to
interrupt
him
comrades
said
he
at
length
this
is
an
unfortunate
but
it
could
not
be
avoided
it
is
well
it
is
no
worse
as
it
is
we
must
alter
our
plans
they
will
be
sure
to
return
on
his
track
and
follow
their
own
trail
back
to
the
navajo
towns
what
then
our
band
can
not
either
come
on
to
the
pinon
or
cross
the
at
any
point
they
would
discover
our
tracks
to
a
certainty
why
ca
we
go
straight
up
to
whar
the
rest
cached
and
then
take
round
by
the
old
mine
that
wo
interfere
with
the
nohow
this
was
proposed
by
one
of
the
hunters
vaya
rejoined
a
mexican
we
should
meet
the
navajoes
just
when
we
had
got
to
their
town
carrai
that
would
never
do
amigo
there
would
many
of
us
get
back
again
santisima
no
we
ai
obleeged
to
meet
them
argued
the
first
speaker
not
to
stop
at
thur
town
when
they
find
the
nigger
hai
been
back
it
is
true
said
seguin
they
will
not
remain
there
they
will
doubtless
return
on
the
again
but
i
know
the
country
by
the
mine
so
do
i
so
do
i
cried
several
voices
there
is
no
game
continued
seguin
we
have
no
provisions
it
is
therefore
impossible
for
us
to
go
that
way
we
could
go
it
nohow
we
should
starve
before
we
had
got
through
the
mimbres
thar
no
water
that
way
no
by
gosh
not
enough
to
make
a
drink
for
a
we
must
take
our
chances
then
said
seguin
here
he
paused
thoughtfully
and
with
a
gloomy
expression
of
countenance
we
must
cross
the
trail
he
continued
and
go
by
the
prieto
or
abandon
the
expedition
the
word
prieto
in
opposition
to
the
phrase
abandon
the
expedition
put
the
hunters
to
their
wits
end
for
invention
and
plan
after
plan
was
proposed
all
however
ending
in
the
probability
in
fact
certainty
that
if
adopted
our
trail
would
be
discovered
by
the
enemy
and
followed
up
before
we
could
escape
back
to
the
del
norte
they
were
therefore
one
after
another
rejected
during
all
this
discussion
old
rube
had
not
said
a
word
the
earless
trapper
was
sitting
upon
the
prairie
squat
on
his
hams
tracing
out
some
lines
with
his
bow
and
apparently
laying
out
the
plan
of
a
fortification
what
are
ye
doin
old
hoss
inquired
one
of
his
comrades
my
hearin
ai
as
good
as
afore
i
kim
into
this
cussed
country
but
i
thought
i
heerd
some
o
say
jest
now
we
cud
cross
the
trail
bein
followed
in
two
days
that
a
lie
it
are
how
are
ye
goin
to
prove
it
hoss
chut
man
yur
tongue
wags
like
a
beaver
tail
in
can
you
suggest
any
way
in
which
it
can
be
done
rube
i
confess
i
see
none
as
seguin
made
this
appeal
all
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
trapper
why
cap
i
kin
surgest
my
own
notion
o
the
thing
it
may
be
right
an
it
may
be
right
but
if
it
wur
follered
out
there
be
neither
nor
navagh
that
smell
where
we
go
for
a
week
if
they
diz
may
cut
my
ears
off
this
was
a
favourite
joke
with
rube
and
the
hunters
only
laughed
seguin
himself
could
not
restrain
a
smile
as
he
requested
the
speaker
to
proceed
fust
an
then
said
rube
thur
not
to
come
arter
that
nigger
in
less
than
two
days
how
can
you
tell
that
this
way
see
he
only
second
chief
an
they
kin
go
on
well
enough
him
but
that
ai
it
the
injun
forgot
his
bow
white
at
that
now
all
knows
as
well
as
this
child
that
that
a
big
disgrace
in
the
eyes
o
injuns
you
right
about
that
hoss
remarked
one
wal
so
the
ole
thinks
now
see
it
as
plain
as
peak
that
he
kim
away
back
tellin
any
o
the
rest
a
syllabub
about
it
he
not
let
know
if
he
kud
help
it
that
is
not
improbable
said
seguin
proceed
rube
that
continued
the
trapper
i
stake
high
thet
he
ordered
them
not
to
foller
him
afeerd
thet
some
on
mout
see
what
he
kim
for
if
he
they
knew
or
suspected
he
sent
some
other
an
not
kum
himself
that
what
he
done
this
was
all
probable
enough
and
with
the
knowledge
which
the
possessed
of
the
navajo
character
they
one
and
all
believed
it
to
be
so
i
sartin
they
kum
back
continued
rube
that
ur
his
half
o
the
tribe
anyways
but
it
be
three
days
clur
an
well
up
till
another
afore
they
drinks
peenyun
water
but
they
would
strike
our
trail
the
day
after
if
we
were
green
fools
enough
to
let
they
wud
how
can
we
prevent
that
asked
seguin
easy
as
fallin
off
a
log
how
how
inquired
several
at
once
by
puttin
them
on
another
scent
do
see
yes
but
in
what
way
can
we
effect
that
inquired
seguin
why
cap
yur
tumble
has
surely
dumfoundered
ye
i
wud
think
less
these
other
dummies
not
seein
at
a
glimp
how
we
kin
do
it
i
confess
rube
replied
seguin
with
a
smile
i
do
not
perceive
how
we
can
mislead
them
wal
then
continued
the
trapper
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
at
his
own
superior
this
child
to
tell
how
kin
put
them
on
a
different
track
hooraw
for
you
old
hoss
see
a
quiver
on
that
injun
back
ay
ay
cried
several
voices
it
full
o
arrows
or
pretty
near
it
i
reckin
it
is
well
wal
then
let
some
o
us
ride
the
injun
mustang
any
other
critter
thet
got
the
same
track
do
away
down
the
trail
an
stick
them
things
pointin
an
if
the
navagh
do
travel
that
a
way
till
they
comes
up
with
the
may
have
this
child
har
for
a
plug
o
the
wust
kaintucky
terbaccer
viva
he
right
he
right
hooraw
for
old
rube
and
various
exclamations
were
uttered
by
the
hunters
needcessary
for
them
to
know
why
he
shud
tuk
that
track
they
know
his
arrows
that
enuf
by
the
time
they
gits
back
with
their
fingers
in
thur
we
hev
start
enough
to
carry
us
to
hackensack
ay
that
we
will
by
gollies
the
band
continued
rube
need

the
buffler
this
side
arter
the
splurry
them
injuns
has
gin
them
that
is
true
enough
said
seguin
we
must
go
round
the
mountain
before
we
can
expect
to
fall
in
with
the
buffalo
the
indian
hunt
has
chased
them
clean
off
from
the
llanos
come
then
let
us
set
about
our
work
at
once
we
have
yet
two
hours
before
sunset
what
would
you
do
first
rube
you
have
given
the
plan
i
will
trust
to
you
for
the
details
why
in
my
opeenyun
cap
the
fust
thing
to
be
did
are
to
send
a
man
as
straight
as
he
can
gallip
to
whur
the
band
cached
let
him
fotch
them
acrost
the
trail
where
should
they
cross
do
you
think
about
twenty
mile
north
o
hyur
thur
a
dry
ridge
an
a
good
grist
loose
donicks
if
they
cross
as
they
oughter
they
need
make
much
sign
i
kud
take
a
train
o
bent
waggons
over
that
puzzle
deaf
smith
to
foller
i
kud
i
will
send
a
man
off
instantly
here
sanchez
you
have
a
good
horse
and
know
the
ground
it
is
not
over
twenty
miles
to
where
they
are
cached
bring
them
along
the
ridge
and
with
caution
as
you
have
heard
you
will
find
us
around
the
north
point
of
the
mountain
you
can
travel
all
night
and
be
up
with
us
early
in
the
morning
away
the
torero
without
making
any
answer
drew
his
horse
from
the
picket
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
rode
off
at
a
gallop
towards
the
it
is
fortunate
said
seguin
looking
after
him
for
some
moments
that
they
have
trampled
the
ground
about
here
else
the
tracks
made
in
our
last
encounter
would
certainly
have
told
tales
upon
us
thur
no
danger
about
that
rejoined
rube
but
when
we
rides
from
hyur
we
must
foller
their
trail
they
soon
sight
our
back
tracks
we
had
best
keep
up
yander
among
the
loose
donicks
rube
pointed
to
the
shingle
that
stretched
north
and
south
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
yes
that
shall
be
our
course
we
can
leave
this
without
leaving
any
tracks
what
next
the
next
idee
ur
to
get
rid
o
yon
piece
o
and
the
trapper
as
he
spoke
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
skeleton
true
i
had
forgotten
it
what
shall
we
do
with
it
bury
it
advised
one
wagh
no
burn
it
cried
another
ay
that
best
said
a
third
the
latter
suggestion
was
adopted
the
skeleton
was
brought
down
the
stains
of
the
blood
were
carefully
rubbed
from
the
rocks
the
skull
was
shivered
with
a
tomahawk
and
the
joints
were
broken
in
pieces
the
whole
mass
was
then
flung
upon
the
fire
and
pounded
down
among
numerous
bones
of
the
buffalo
already
simmering
in
the
cinders
an
anatomist
only
could
have
detected
the
presence
of
a
human
skeleton
now
rube
the
arrows
if
leave
that
to
me
an
bill
garey
i
think
them
two
niggurs
kin
fix
so
as
to
bamfoozle
any
injuns
thur
is
in
these
parts
we
hev
to
go
three
mile
or
tharabout
but
we
git
back
by
the
time
hev
filled
yur
gourds
an
got
yur
traps
ready
for
skeetin
very
well
take
the
arrows
four
gobs
for
us
said
rube
taking
that
number
from
the
quiver
keep
the
rest
want
more
afore
we
start
thur
not
a
tail
o
anythin
else
till
we
git
clur

the
mountain
yander
billee
throw
your
ugly
props

navagh
mustang

too
but
i
wud
giv
my
old
mar
for
a
hul
cavayard
o
him
gi
a
sprig
the
black
feather
here
the
old
trapper
drew
one
of
the
ostrich
feathers
out
of
the
helmet
of
the
navajo
chief
and
continued
boyees
take
care
o
the
ole
mar
till
i
kum
back
an
do
let
her
stampede
do
hear
i
wants
a
blanket
do
all
speak
at
oncest

rube
here
cried
several
holding
out
their
blankets
a
one
do
we
needs
three
bill
an
mine
an
hyur
billee
take
these
afore
ye
now
ride
down
the
trail
three
hunred
yards
or
tharabout
an
then
pull
up
do
take
the
beaten
pad
but
keep
alongside
an
make
big
tracks
gallop
the
young
hunter
laid
his
quirt
to
the
flanks
of
the
mustang
and
started
at
full
gallop
along
the
apache
trail
when
he
had
ridden
a
distance
of
three
hundred
yards
or
so
he
halted
to
wait
for
further
directions
from
his
comrade
old
rube
at
the
same
time
took
an
arrow
and
fastening
a
piece
of
ostrich
feather
to
the
barb
adjusted
it
on
one
of
the
upright
poles
which
the
indians
had
left
standing
on
the
it
was
placed
in
such
a
manner
that
the
head
pointed
southward
in
the
direction
of
the
apache
trail
and
was
so
conspicuous
with
the
black
feather
that
no
one
coming
in
from
the
llanos
could
fail
to
see
it
this
done
he
followed
his
companion
on
foot
keeping
wide
out
from
the
trail
and
making
his
tracks
with
great
caution
on
coming
up
with
garey
he
stuck
a
second
arrow
in
the
ground
its
point
also
inclined
to
the
south
and
so
that
it
could
be
seen
from
the
former
one
garey
then
galloped
forward
keeping
on
the
trail
while
rube
struck
out
again
to
the
open
prairie
and
advanced
in
a
line
parallel
to
it
having
ridden
a
distance
of
two
or
three
miles
garey
slackened
his
pace
and
put
the
mustang
to
a
slow
walk
a
little
farther
on
he
again
halted
and
held
his
horse
at
rest
in
the
beaten
path
rube
now
came
up
and
spread
the
three
blankets
lengthwise
along
the
ground
and
leading
westward
from
the
trail
garey
dismounted
and
led
the
animal
gently
on
the
blankets
as
its
feet
rested
on
two
at
a
time
each
as
it
became
the
rearmost
was
taken
up
and
spread
again
in
front
and
this
was
repeated
until
they
had
got
the
mustang
some
fifty
lengths
of
himself
out
into
the
prairie
the
movement
was
executed
with
an
adroitness
equal
to
that
which
characterised
the
feat
of
sir
walter
raleigh
garey
now
took
up
the
blankets
and
remounting
commenced
riding
slowly
back
by
the
foot
of
the
mountain
while
rube
returned
to
the
trail
and
placed
a
third
arrow
at
the
point
where
the
mustang
had
parted
from
it
he
then
proceeded
south
as
before
one
more
was
yet
needed
to
make
doubly
sure
when
he
had
gone
about
half
a
mile
we
saw
him
stoop
over
the
trail
rise
up
again
cross
toward
the
mountain
foot
and
follow
the
path
taken
by
his
companion
the
work
was
done
the
were
set
the
ruse
was
complete
el
sol
meanwhile
had
been
busy
several
wolves
were
killed
and
skinned
and
the
meat
was
packed
in
their
skins
the
gourds
were
filled
our
captive
was
tied
on
a
mule
and
we
stood
waiting
the
return
of
the
trappers
seguin
had
resolved
to
leave
two
men
at
the
spring
as
videttes
they
were
to
keep
their
horses
by
the
rocks
and
supply
them
with
the
so
as
to
make
no
fresh
tracks
at
the
water
one
was
to
remain
constantly
on
an
eminence
and
watch
the
prairie
with
the
glass
they
could
thus
descry
the
returning
navajoes
in
time
to
escape
unobserved
themselves
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
they
were
then
to
halt
at
a
place
ten
miles
to
the
north
where
they
could
still
have
a
view
of
the
plain
there
they
were
to
remain
until
they
had
ascertained
what
direction
the
indians
should
take
after
leaving
the
spring
when
they
were
to
hurry
forward
and
join
the
band
with
their
tidings
all
these
arrangements
having
been
completed
as
rube
and
garey
came
up
we
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
by
a
circuitous
route
for
the
mountain
foot
when
close
in
we
found
the
path
strewed
with
loose
upon
which
the
hoofs
of
our
animals
left
no
track
over
this
we
rode
forward
heading
to
the
north
and
keeping
in
a
line
nearly
parallel
to
the
chapter
thirty
one
a
buffalo
surround
a
march
of
twenty
miles
brought
us
to
the
place
where
we
expected
to
be
joined
by
the
band
we
found
a
small
stream
heading
in
the
pinon
range
and
running
westward
to
the
san
pedro
it
was
fringed
with
and
willows
and
with
grass
in
abundance
for
our
horses
here
we
encamped
kindled
a
fire
in
the
thicket
cooked
our
ate
it
and
went
to
sleep
the
band
came
up
in
the
morning
having
travelled
all
night
their
provisions
were
spent
as
well
as
ours
and
instead
of
resting
our
wearied
animals
we
pushed
on
through
a
pass
in
the
sierra
in
hopes
of
finding
game
on
the
other
side
about
noon
we
debouched
through
the
mountain
pass
into
a
country
of
openings
small
prairies
bounded
by
jungly
forests
and
interspersed
with
timber
islands
these
prairies
were
covered
with
tall
grass
and
buffalo
signs
appeared
as
we
rode
into
them
we
saw
their
roads
chips
and
wallows
we
saw
moreover
the
de
of
the
wild
cattle
we
would
soon
meet
with
one
or
the
other
we
were
still
on
the
stream
by
which
we
had
camped
the
night
before
and
we
made
a
noon
halt
to
refresh
our
animals
the
forms
of
the
cacti
were
around
us
bearing
red
and
yellow
fruit
in
abundance
we
plucked
the
pears
of
the
pitahaya
and
ate
them
greedily
we
found
yampo
and
roots
of
the
pomme
blanche
we
dined
on
fruits
and
vegetables
of
various
sorts
indigenous
only
to
this
wild
region
but
the
stomachs
of
the
hunters
longed
for
their
favourite
food
the
hump
ribs
and
boudins
of
the
buffalo
and
after
a
halt
of
two
hours
we
moved
forward
through
the
openings
we
had
ridden
about
an
hour
among
chapparal
when
rube
who
was
some
paces
in
advance
acting
as
guide
turned
in
his
saddle
and
pointed
downward
what
there
rube
asked
seguin
in
a
low
voice
fresh
track
buffler
what
number
can
you
guess
a
gang
o
fifty
or
tharabout
they
tuk
through
the
thicket
i
kin
sight
the
sky
thur
clur
ground
not
fur
from
us
and
i
stak
a
plew
thur
in
it
i
think
it
a
small
parairia
cap
halt
here
men
said
seguin
halt
and
keep
silent
ride
forward
rube
come
monsieur
haller
you
fond
of
hunting
come
along
with
us
i
followed
the
guide
and
seguin
through
the
bushes
like
them
riding
slowly
and
silently
in
a
few
minutes
we
reached
the
edge
of
a
prairie
covered
with
long
grass
peering
cautiously
through
the
leaves
of
the
prosopis
we
had
a
full
view
of
the
open
ground
the
buffaloes
were
on
the
plain
it
was
as
rube
had
rightly
conjectured
a
small
prairie
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
width
closed
in
on
all
sides
by
a
thick
chapparal
near
the
centre
was
a
motte
of
heavy
timber
growing
up
from
a
leafy
underwood
a
spur
of
willows
running
out
from
the
timber
indicated
the
presence
of
water
thur
a
spring
yander
muttered
rube
they
jest
been
their
noses
at
it
this
was
evident
enough
for
some
of
the
animals
were
at
the
moment
walking
out
of
the
willows
and
we
could
see
the
wet
clay
glistening
upon
their
flanks
and
the
saliva
glancing
down
from
their
jaws
how
will
we
get
at
them
rube
asked
seguin
can
we
approach
them
do
you
think
i
doubt
not
cap
the
grass
hardly
kiver
us
an
thur
out
o
range
o
the
bushes
how
then
we
can
not
run
them
there
not
room
they
would
be
into
the
thicket
at
the
first
dash
we
would
lose
every
hoof
of
them
sartin
as
scripter
what
is
to
be
done
this
niggur
sees
but
one
other
plan
as
kin
be
used
jest
at
this
time
what
is
it
surround
right
if
we
can
do
that
how
is
the
wind
dead
as
an
injun
wi
his
head
cut
off
replied
the
trapper
taking
a
small
feather
out
of
his
cap
and
tossing
it
in
the
air
see
cap
it
falls
plump
it
does
truly
we
kin
easily
git
roun
them
bufflers
afore
they
wind
us
an
we
hev
men
enough
to
make
a
picket
fence
about
them
we
can
hardly
set
about
it
too
soon
cap
thur
a
movin
torst
the
edge
yander
let
us
divide
the
men
then
said
seguin
turning
his
horse
you
can
guide
of
them
to
their
stands
i
will
go
with
the
other
monsieur
haller
you
had
better
remain
where
you
are
it
is
as
good
a
stand
as
you
can
get
have
patience
it
may
be
an
hour
before
all
are
placed
when
you
hear
the
bugle
you
may
gallop
forward
and
do
your
best
if
we
succeed
you
shall
have
sport
and
a
good
supper
which
i
suppose
you
feel
the
need
of
by
this
time
so
saying
seguin
left
me
and
rode
back
to
the
men
followed
by
old
rube
it
was
their
purpose
to
separate
the
band
into
two
parties
each
taking
an
opposite
direction
and
to
drop
men
here
and
there
at
regular
intervals
around
the
prairie
they
would
keep
in
the
thicket
while
on
the
march
and
only
discover
themselves
at
a
given
signal
in
this
way
should
the
buffaloes
allow
time
for
the
execution
of
the
movement
we
should
be
almost
certain
of
securing
the
whole
gang
as
soon
as
seguin
had
left
me
i
looked
to
my
rifle
and
pistols
putting
on
a
fresh
set
of
caps
after
that
having
nothing
else
to
occupy
me
i
remained
seated
in
my
saddle
eyeing
the
animals
as
they
fed
unconscious
of
danger
i
was
full
of
anxiety
lest
some
clumsy
fellow
might
discover
himself
too
soon
and
thus
spoil
our
anticipated
sport
after
a
while
i
could
see
the
birds
flying
up
from
the
thicket
and
the
screaming
of
the
blue
jay
indicated
to
me
the
progress
of
the
surround
now
and
then
an
old
bull
on
the
skirts
of
the
herd
would
toss
up
his
shaggy
mane
snuff
the
wind
and
strike
the
ground
fiercely
with
his
hoof
evidently
labouring
under
a
suspicion
that
all
was
not
right
the
others
did
not
seem
to
heed
these
demonstrations
but
kept
on
quietly
cropping
the
luxuriant
grama
i
was
thinking
how
nicely
we
were
going
to
have
them
in
the
trap
when
an
object
caught
my
eye
just
emerging
from
the
motte
it
was
a
buffalo
calf
and
i
saw
that
it
was
proceeding
to
join
the
gang
i
thought
it
somewhat
strange
that
it
should
be
separated
from
the
rest
for
the
calves
trained
by
their
mothers
to
know
the
wolf
usually
keep
up
with
the
herd
it
has
stayed
behind
at
the
spring
thought
i
perhaps
the
others
pushed
it
from
the
water
and
it
could
not
drink
until
they
were
gone
i
fancied
that
it
moved
clumsily
as
if
wounded
but
it
was
passing
through
the
long
grass
and
i
could
not
get
a
good
view
of
it
there
was
a
pack
of
coyotes
there
always
is
sneaking
after
the
herd
these
perceiving
the
calf
as
it
came
out
of
the
timber
made
an
instant
and
simultaneous
attack
upon
it
i
could
see
them
skipping
around
it
and
fancied
i
could
hear
their
fierce
snarling
but
the
calf
appeared
to
fight
its
way
through
the
thick
of
them
and
after
a
short
while
i
saw
it
close
in
to
its
companions
where
i
lost
sight
of
it
among
the
others
a
game
young
bull
soliloquised
i
and
again
i
ran
my
eye
around
the
skirting
of
the
chapparal
to
watch
how
the
hunters
were
getting
forward
with
the
surround
i
could
perceive
the
flashing
of
brilliant
wings
over
the
bramble
and
hear
the
shrill
voices
of
the
judging
by
these
i
concluded
that
the
men
were
moving
slowly
enough
it
was
half
an
hour
since
seguin
had
left
me
and
i
could
perceive
that
they
were
not
round
as
yet
i
began
to
make
calculations
as
to
how
long
i
would
have
to
wait
soliloquising
as
follows
diameter
of
the
prairie
a
mile
and
a
half
it
is
a
circle
three
times
that
four
miles
and
a
half
phew
i
shall
not
hear
the
signal
in
much
less
than
an
hour
i
must
be
patient
then
and
what
the
brutes
are
lying
down
good
there
is
no
danger
now
of
their
making
off
we
shall
have
rare
sport
one
two
three
six
of
them
down
it
must
be
the
heat
and
the
water
they
have
drunk
too
much
there
goes
another
lucky
devils
they
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
eat
and
sleep
while
i
no
eight
down
well
i
hope
soon
to
eat
too
what
an
odd
way
they
have
of
coming
to
the
ground
how
different
from
anything
of
the
bovine
tribe
i
have
yet
observed
i
have
never
seen
buffaloes
quieting
down
before
one
would
think
they
were
falling
as
if
shot
two
more
alongside
the
rest
they
will
soon
be
all
upon
the
turf
so
much
the
better
we
can
gallop
up
before
they
get
to
their
feet
again
oh
that
i
could
hear
that
horn
and
thus
i
went
on
rambling
from
thought
to
thought
and
listening
for
the
signal
although
i
knew
that
it
could
not
be
given
for
some
time
yet
the
buffaloes
kept
moving
slowly
onward
browsing
as
they
went
and
continuing
to
lie
down
one
after
another
i
thought
it
strange
their
stretching
themselves
thus
successively
but
i
had
observed
farm
cattle
do
the
same
and
i
was
at
that
time
but
little
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
the
buffalo
some
of
them
appeared
to
toss
about
on
the
ground
and
kick
violently
i
had
heard
of
a
peculiarity
of
these
animals
termed
wallowing
they
are
at
it
thought
i
wished
much
to
have
a
clearer
view
of
this
curious
exercise
but
the
high
grass
prevented
me
i
could
only
see
their
shaggy
shoulders
and
occasionally
their
hoofs
kicking
up
over
the
sward
i
watched
their
movements
with
great
interest
now
feeling
secure
that
the
surround
would
be
complete
before
they
would
think
of
rising
at
length
the
last
one
of
the
gang
followed
the
example
of
his
companions
and
dropped
over
they
were
all
now
upon
their
sides
in
the
bunch
grass
i
thought
i
noticed
the
calf
still
upon
its
feet
but
at
that
moment
the
bugle
sounded
and
a
simultaneous
cheer
broke
from
all
sides
of
the
prairie
i
pressed
the
spur
to
my
horse
flank
and
dashed
out
into
the
open
plain
fifty
others
had
done
the
same
yelling
as
they
shot
out
of
the
thicket
with
my
reins
resting
on
my
left
fingers
and
my
rifle
thrown
crosswise
i
galloped
forward
filled
with
the
wild
excitement
that
such
an
adventure
imparts
i
was
cocked
and
ready
resolved
upon
having
the
first
shot
it
was
but
a
short
distance
from
where
i
had
started
to
the
nearest
buffalo
i
was
soon
within
range
my
horse
flying
like
an
arrow
is
the
animal
asleep
i
am
within
ten
paces
of
him
and
still
he
stirs
not
i
will
fire
at
him
as
he
lies
i
raised
my
rifle
levelled
it
and
was
about
to
pull
the
trigger
when
something
red
gleamed
before
my
eyes
it
was
blood
i
lowered
the
piece
with
a
feeling
of
terror
and
commenced
dragging
upon
the
rein
but
before
i
could
pull
up
i
was
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
prostrate
herd
here
my
horse
suddenly
stopped
and
i
sat
in
my
saddle
as
if
i
was
under
the
influence
of
a
superstitious
awe
blood
was
before
me
and
around
me
turn
which
way
i
would
my
eye
rested
upon
blood
my
comrades
closed
in
yelling
as
they
came
but
their
yelling
suddenly
ceased
and
one
by
one
reined
up
as
i
had
done
with
looks
of
consternation
and
wonder
it
was
not
strange
at
such
a
sight
before
us
lay
the
bodies
of
the
buffaloes
they
were
all
dead
or
quivering
in
the
last
throes
each
bad
a
wound
above
the
brisket
and
from
this
the
red
stream
gurled
out
and
trickled
down
their
still
panting
sides
blood
welled
from
their
mouths
and
out
of
their
nostrils
pools
of
it
were
filtering
through
the
prairie
turf
and
clotted
gouts
flung
out
by
the
struggling
hoof
sprinkled
the
grass
around
them
oh
heavens
what
could
it
mean
wagh
santisima
sacre
dieu
were
the
exclamations
of
the
hunters
surely
no
mortal
hand
has
done
this
it
nuthin
else
cried
a
voice
ef
yur
call
an
injun
a
mortal
a
and
this
child
look
i
heard
the
click
of
a
rifle
along
with
this
abrupt
exclamation
i
turned
suddenly
rube
was
in
the
act
of
levelling
his
piece
my
eye
involuntarily
followed
the
direction
of
the
barrel
there
was
an
object
moving
in
the
long
grass
a
buffalo
that
still
kicks
thought
i
as
i
saw
the
mass
of
hair
he
is
going
to
finish
him
it
is
the
calf
i
had
scarcely
made
the
observation
when
the
animal
reared
up
on
its
hind
legs
uttering
a
wild
human
scream
the
shaggy
hide
was
flung
off
and
a
naked
savage
appeared
holding
out
his
arms
in
an
attitude
of
supplication
i
could
not
have
saved
him
the
rifle
had
cracked
the
ball
had
sped
i
saw
it
piercing
his
brown
breast
as
a
drop
of
sleet
strikes
upon
the
pane
of
glass
the
red
spout
gushed
forth
and
the
victim
fell
forward
upon
the
body
of
one
of
the
animals
wagh
rube
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
why
did
ye
give
him
time
to
skin
the
meat
he
mout
as
well
done
that
when
he
war
about
it
and
the
man
laughed
at
his
savage
jest
look
hyur
boyees
said
rube
pointing
to
the
motte
if
look
sharp
yur
mout
scare
up
another
calf
yander
away
i
to
see
arter
this
injun
har
i
am
the
hunters
at
the
suggestion
galloped
off
to
surround
the
motte
i
felt
a
degree
of
irresolution
and
disgust
at
this
cool
shedding
of
blood
i
drew
my
rein
almost
involuntarily
and
moved
forward
to
the
spot
where
the
savage
had
fallen
he
lay
back
uppermost
he
was
naked
to
the
there
was
the
debouchure
of
a
bullet
below
the
left
shoulder
and
the
stream
was
trickling
down
his
ribs
the
limbs
still
quivered
but
it
was
in
the
last
spasms
of
parting
life
the
hide
in
which
he
had
disguised
himself
lay
piled
up
where
it
had
been
flung
beside
it
were
a
bow
and
several
arrows
the
latter
were
crimsoned
to
the
notch
the
feathers
steeped
in
blood
and
clinging
to
the
shafts
they
had
pierced
the
huge
bodies
of
the
animals
passing
through
and
through
each
arrow
had
taken
many
lives
the
old
trapper
rode
up
to
the
corpse
and
leisurely
dismounted
from
his
mare
fifty
dollar
a
plew
he
muttered
unsheathing
his
knife
and
stooping
over
the
body
it

continued
grasping
the
long
hair
of
the
savage
and
holding
the
face
upward
let
get
a
squint
of
your
phisog
hooraw
coyote

and
a
gleam
of
triumph
lit
up
the
countenance
of
the
old
man
as
he
uttered
these
wild
exclamations
apash
is
he
asked
one
of
the
hunters
who
had
remained
near
the
spot
that

so
saying
he
gathered
the
long
crown
locks
in
his
left
hand
and
with
two
slashes
of
his
knife
held
quarte
and
tierce
he
cut
a
circle
around
the
top
of
the
head
as
perfect
as
if
it
had
been
traced
by
compasses
he
then
took
a
turn
of
the
hair
over
his
wrist
giving
it
a
quick
jerk
outward
at
the
same
instant
the
keen
blade
passed
under
the
skin
and
the
scalp
was
taken
counts
six
he
continued
muttering
to
himself
while
placing
the
scalp
in
his
belt

trappin
says
i
having
secured
the
bleeding
trophy
he
wiped
his
knife
upon
the
hair
of
one
of
the
buffaloes
and
proceeded
to
cut
a
small
notch
in
the
woodwork
of
his
gun
alongside
five
others
that
had
been
carved
there
already
these
six
notches
stood
for
apaches
only
for
as
my
eye
wandered
along
the
outlines
of
the
piece
i
saw
that
there
were
many
other
columns
in
that
terrible
register
chapter
thirty
two
another
coup
a
shot
ringing
in
my
ears
caused
me
to
withdraw
my
attention
from
the
proceedings
of
the
earless
trapper
as
i
turned
i
saw
a
blue
cloud
floating
away
over
the
prairie
but
i
could
not
tell
at
what
the
shot
had
been
fired
thirty
or
forty
of
the
hunters
had
surrounded
the
motte
and
halted
were
sitting
in
their
saddles
in
a
kind
of
irregular
circle
they
were
still
at
some
distance
from
the
timber
as
if
keeping
out
of
they
held
their
guns
crosswise
and
were
shouting
to
one
another
it
was
improbable
that
the
savage
was
alone
doubtless
there
were
some
of
his
companions
in
the
thicket
there
could
not
be
many
however
for
the
underwood
was
not
large
enough
to
conceal
more
than
a
dozen
bodies
and
the
keen
eyes
of
the
hunters
were
piercing
it
in
every
direction
they
reminded
me
of
so
many
huntsmen
in
a
gorse
waiting
the
game
to
be
sprung
but
here
the
game
was
human
it
was
a
terrible
spectacle
i
looked
towards
seguin
thinking
that
he
might
interfere
to
prevent
the
barbarous
battue
he
noticed
my
inquiring
glance
and
turned
his
face
from
me
i
fancied
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
the
work
in
which
his
followers
were
engaged
but
the
killing
or
capture
of
whatever
indians
might
be
in
the
motte
had
now
become
a
necessary
measure
and
i
knew
that
any
remonstrance
of
mine
would
be
disregarded
as
for
the
men
themselves
they
would
have
laughed
at
it
this
was
their
pastime
their
profession
and
i
am
certain
that
at
that
moment
their
feelings
were
not
very
different
from
those
which
would
have
actuated
them
had
they
been
driving
a
bear
from
his
den
they
were
perhaps
a
trifle
more
intense
certainly
not
more
inclined
towards
mercy
i
reined
up
my
horse
and
awaited
with
painful
emotions
the
of
this
savage
drama
vaya
irlandes
what
did
you
see
inquired
one
of
the
mexicans
appealing
to
barney
i
saw
by
this
that
it
was
the
irishman
who
had
fired
the
shot
a
by
japers
replied
the
latter
war
it
yer
own
shadder
ye
sighted
in
the
water
cried
a
hunter
jeeringly
maybe
it
was
the
divil
barney
in
trath
frinds
i
saw
a
somethin
that
looked
mighty
like
him
and
i
kilt
it
too
ha
ha
barney
has
killed
the
devil
ha
ha
wagh
exclaimed
a
trapper
spurring
his
horse
toward
the
thicket
the
fool
saw
nothin
i
chance
it
anyhow
stop
comrade
cried
the
hunter
garey
let
take
a
safer
plan
redhead
right
thar
injuns
in
them
bushes
whether
he
seen
it
or
not
that
skunk
war
by
himself
i
reckin
try
this
a
way
the
young
trapper
dismounted
and
turned
his
horse
broadside
to
the
bushes
keeping
on
the
outside
he
commenced
walking
the
animal
in
a
spiral
ring
that
gradually
closed
in
upon
the
clump
in
this
way
his
body
was
screened
and
his
head
only
could
be
seen
above
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
over
which
he
rested
his
rifle
cocked
and
ready
several
others
observing
this
movement
on
the
part
of
garey
dismounted
and
followed
his
example
a
deep
silence
prevailed
as
they
narrowed
the
diameters
of
their
circling
courses
in
a
short
time
they
were
close
in
to
the
motte
yet
still
no
arrow
whizzed
out
was
there
no
one
there
so
it
seemed
and
the
men
pushed
fearlessly
into
the
thicket
i
watched
all
this
with
excited
feelings
i
began
to
hope
there
was
no
one
in
the
bushes
i
listened
to
every
sound
i
heard
the
snapping
of
the
twigs
and
the
muttering
of
the
men
there
was
a
moment
silence
as
they
pushed
eagerly
forward
then
i
heard
a
sudden
exclamation
and
a
voice
calling
out
dead
hurrah
for
barney
barney
bullet
through
him
by
the
holies
cried
another
hollo
old
come
hyar
and
see
what
ye
done
the
rest
of
the
hunters
along
with
the
soldier
now
rode
forward
to
the
copse
i
moved
slowly
after
on
coming
up
i
saw
them
dragging
the
body
of
an
indian
into
the
open
ground
a
naked
savage
like
the
other
he
was
dead
and
they
were
preparing
to
scalp
him
come
now
barney
cried
one
of
the
men
in
a
joking
manner
the
why
do
ye
off
wid
it
man
it
moine
dev
yez
say
asked
barney
appealing
to
the
speaker
sartinly
you
killed
him
it
by
right
an
it
is
raaly
worth
fifty
dollars
good
as
wheat
for
that
would
yez
be
so
frindly
thin
as
to
cut
it
aff
for
me
oh
sartinly
wid
all
the
plizyer
of
life
replied
the
hunter
imitating
barney
accent
at
the
same
time
severing
the
scalp
and
handing
it
to
him
barney
took
the
hideous
trophy
and
i
fancy
that
he
did
not
feel
very
proud
of
it
poor
celt
he
may
have
been
guilty
of
many
a
breach
in
the
laws
of
garrison
discipline
but
it
was
evident
that
this
was
his
first
lesson
in
the
letting
of
human
blood
the
hunters
now
dismounted
and
commenced
trampling
the
thicket
through
and
through
the
search
was
most
minute
for
there
was
still
a
mystery
an
extra
bow
that
is
to
say
a
third
had
been
found
with
its
quiver
of
arrows
where
was
the
owner
could
he
have
escaped
from
the
thicket
while
the
men
were
engaged
around
the
fallen
buffaloes
he
might
though
it
was
barely
probable
but
the
hunters
knew
that
these
savages
run
more
like
wild
animals
like
hares
than
human
beings
and
he
might
have
escaped
to
the
chapparal
if
that
injun
has
got
clar
said
garey
we
no
time
to
lose
in
skinnin
them
bufflers
thar
plenty
o
his
tribe
not
twenty
miles
from
hyar
i
look
down
among
the
willows
there
cried
the
voice
of
the
chief
close
down
to
the
water
there
was
a
pool
it
was
turbid
and
trampled
around
the
edges
with
buffalo
tracks
on
one
side
it
was
deep
here
willows
dropped
over
and
hung
into
the
water
several
men
pressed
into
this
side
and
commenced
sounding
the
bottom
with
their
lances
and
the
butts
of
their
rifles
old
rube
had
come
up
among
the
rest
and
was
drawing
the
stopper
of
his
with
his
teeth
apparently
with
the
intention
of
reloading
his
small
dark
eyes
were
scintillating
every
way
at
once
above
around
him
and
into
the
water
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
enter
his
head
i
saw
him
push
back
the
plug
grasp
the
irishman
who
was
nearest
him
by
the
arm
and
mutter
in
a
low
and
hurried
voice
paddy
barney
gi
us
yur
gun
quick
man
quick
barney
at
this
earnest
solicitation
immediately
surrendered
his
piece
taking
the
empty
rifle
that
was
thrust
into
his
hand
by
the
trapper
rube
eagerly
grasped
the
musket
and
stood
for
a
moment
as
if
he
was
about
to
fire
at
some
object
in
the
pond
suddenly
he
jerked
his
body
round
and
poising
the
gun
upward
fired
into
the
thick
foliage
a
shrill
scream
followed
a
heavy
body
came
crashing
through
the
branches
and
struck
the
ground
at
my
feet
warm
drops
sparkled
into
my
eyes
causing
me
to
wince
it
was
blood
i
was
blinded
with
it
i
rubbed
my
eyes
to
clear
them
i
heard
men
rushing
from
all
parts
of
the
thicket
when
i
could
see
again
a
naked
savage
was
just
disappearing
through
the
leaves
missed
him
cried
the
trapper
away
wi
yur
sodger
gun
he
added
flinging
down
the
musket
and
rushing
after
the
savage
with
his
drawn
knife
i
followed
among
the
rest
i
heard
several
shots
as
we
scrambled
through
the
brushwood
when
i
had
got
to
the
outer
edge
i
could
see
the
indian
still
on
his
feet
and
running
with
the
speed
of
an
antelope
he
did
not
keep
in
a
direct
line
but
zigzag
leaping
from
side
to
side
in
order
to
baffle
the
aim
of
his
pursuers
whose
rifles
were
all
the
time
ringing
behind
him
as
yet
none
of
their
bullets
had
taken
effect
at
least
so
as
to
cripple
him
there
was
a
streak
of
blood
visible
on
his
brown
body
but
the
wound
wherever
it
was
did
not
seem
to
hinder
him
in
his
flight
i
thought
there
could
be
no
chance
of
his
escape
and
i
had
no
intention
of
emptying
my
gun
at
such
a
mark
i
remained
therefore
among
the
bushes
screening
myself
behind
the
leaves
and
watching
the
chase
some
of
the
hunters
continued
to
follow
him
on
foot
while
the
more
cunning
ones
rushed
back
for
their
horses
these
happened
to
be
all
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
thicket
with
one
exception
and
that
was
the
mare
of
the
trapper
rube
she
was
browsing
where
rube
had
dismounted
out
among
the
slaughtered
buffaloes
and
directly
in
the
line
of
the
chase
as
the
savage
approached
her
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
and
diverging
slightly
from
his
course
he
plucked
up
the
coiled
the
lasso
with
the
dexterity
of
a
gaucho
and
sprang
upon
the
back
it
was
a
idea
but
unfortunate
for
the
indian
he
had
scarcely
touched
the
saddle
when
a
peculiar
shout
was
heard
above
all
other
sounds
it
was
a
call
uttered
in
the
voice
of
the
earless
trapper
the
mustang
recognised
it
and
instead
of
running
forward
obedient
to
the
guidance
of
her
rider
she
wheeled
suddenly
and
came
galloping
back
at
this
moment
a
shot
fired
at
the
savage
scorched
her
hip
and
setting
back
her
ears
she
commenced
squealing
and
kicking
so
violently
that
all
her
feet
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
the
indian
now
endeavoured
to
fling
himself
from
the
saddle
but
the
alternate
plunging
of
the
fore
and
hind
quarters
kept
him
for
some
moments
tossing
in
a
sort
of
balance
he
was
at
length
pitched
outward
and
fell
to
the
ground
upon
his
back
before
he
could
recover
himself
a
mexican
had
ridden
up
and
with
his
long
lance
pinned
him
to
the
earth
a
scene
followed
in
which
rube
played
the
principal
character
in
fact
had
the
stage
to
himself
sodger
guns
were
sent
to
perdition
and
as
the
old
trapper
was
angry
about
the
wound
which
his
mare
had
received
greenhorns
came
in
for
a
share
of
his
anathemas
the
mustang
however
had
sustained
no
serious
damage
and
after
this
was
ascertained
the
emphatic
ebullitions
of
her
master
anger
subsided
into
a
low
growling
and
then
ceased
altogether
as
there
appeared
no
sign
that
there
were
other
savages
in
the
neighbourhood
the
next
concern
of
the
hunters
was
to
satisfy
their
hunger
fires
were
soon
kindled
and
a
plenteous
repast
of
buffalo
meat
produced
the
desired
effect
after
the
meal
was
ended
a
consultation
was
held
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
move
forward
to
the
old
mission
which
was
known
to
be
not
over
ten
miles
distant
we
could
there
defend
ourselves
in
case
of
an
attack
from
the
tribe
of
coyoteros
to
which
the
three
savages
belonged
it
was
feared
by
all
that
these
might
strike
our
trail
and
come
up
with
us
before
we
could
take
our
departure
from
the
ruin
the
buffaloes
were
speedily
skinned
and
packed
and
taking
a
westerly
course
we
journeyed
on
to
the
mission
chapter
thirty
three
a
bitter
trap
we
reached
the
ruin
a
little
after
sunset
we
frightened
the
owl
and
the
wolf
and
made
our
bivouac
among
the
crumbling
walls
our
horses
were
picketed
upon
the
deserted
lawns
and
in
the
orchards
where
the
ripe
fruit
was
raining
down
its
ungathered
showers
fires
were
kindled
lighting
the
grey
pile
with
their
cheerful
blazing
and
joints
of
meat
were
taken
out
of
the
and
roasted
for
supper
there
was
water
in
abundance
a
branch
of
the
san
pedro
swept
past
the
walls
of
the
mission
there
were
yams
in
the
spoliated
gardens
there
were
grapes
and
pomegranates
and
quinces
and
melons
and
pears
and
peaches
and
apples
and
with
all
these
was
our
repast
garnished
it
was
soon
over
and
videttes
were
thrown
out
on
the
tracks
that
led
to
the
ruin
the
men
were
weak
and
weary
with
their
late
fasting
and
in
a
short
while
stretched
themselves
by
their
saddles
and
slept
so
much
for
our
first
night
at
the
mission
of
san
pedro
we
were
to
remain
for
three
days
or
until
the
buffalo
meat
should
be
dried
for
packing
they
were
irksome
days
to
me
idleness
displayed
the
bad
qualities
of
my
associates
the
ribald
jest
and
fearful
oath
rang
continually
in
my
ears
until
i
was
fain
to
wander
off
to
the
woods
with
the
old
botanist
who
during
these
three
days
revelled
in
the
happy
excitement
of
discovery
i
found
companionship
also
in
the
maricopa
this
strange
man
had
studied
science
deeply
and
was
conversant
with
almost
every
noted
author
he
was
reserved
only
when
i
wished
him
to
talk
of
himself
seguin
during
these
days
was
taciturn
and
lonely
he
took
but
little
heed
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
he
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
impatience
as
every
now
and
then
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
tasajo
he
passed
many
hours
upon
the
adjacent
heights
looking
anxiously
towards
the
east
that
point
whence
our
spies
would
come
in
from
the
pinon
there
was
an
azotea
on
the
ruin
i
was
in
the
habit
of
seeking
this
place
at
evening
after
the
sun
had
grown
less
fervid
it
afforded
a
fine
prospect
of
the
valley
but
its
chief
attraction
to
me
lay
in
the
retirement
i
could
there
obtain
the
hunters
rarely
climbed
up
to
it
and
their
wild
and
licenced
converse
was
unheard
for
the
time
i
used
to
spread
my
blanket
among
the
crumbling
parapets
and
stretched
upon
it
deliver
myself
up
to
the
sweet
retrospect
or
to
still
sweeter
dreams
that
my
fancy
outlined
upon
the
future
there
was
one
object
on
my
memory
upon
that
object
only
did
my
hopes
dwell
i
need
not
make
this
declaration
at
least
to
those
who
have
truly
loved
in
the
programme
placed
before
me
by
seguin
i
had
not
bargained
for
such
wanton
cruelties
as
i
was
now
compelled
to
witness
it
was
not
the
time
to
look
back
but
forward
and
perhaps
over
other
scenes
of
blood
and
brutality
to
that
happier
hour
when
i
should
have
redeemed
my
promise
and
won
the
prize
beautiful
zoe
my
reverie
was
interrupted
i
heard
voices
and
footsteps
they
were
approaching
the
spot
where
i
lay
i
could
see
that
there
were
two
men
engaged
in
an
earnest
conversation
they
did
not
notice
me
as
i
was
behind
some
fragments
of
the
broken
parapet
and
in
the
shadow
as
they
drew
nearer
i
recognised
the
patois
of
my
canadian
follower
and
that
of
his
companion
was
not
to
be
mistaken
the
brogue
was
barney
beyond
a
doubt
these
worthies
i
had
lately
noticed
had
become
as
thick
as
two
thieves
and
were
much
in
each
other
company
some
act
of
kindness
had
endeared
the
infantry
to
his
more
astute
and
experienced
associate
who
had
taken
him
under
his
patronage
and
protection
i
was
vexed
at
the
intrusion
but
prompted
by
some
impulse
of
curiosity
i
lay
still
and
listened
barney
was
speaking

they

well
thin
now
or
niver
the
time
the
ould
fellow
just
walked
out
for
i
saw
him
meself
this
is
a
nate
place
to
drink
it
in
come
an
show
me
where
he
keeps
it
and
by
saint
patrick
i
yer
man
to
hook
it
tres
bien
allons
monsieur
barney
allons
unintelligible
as
this
conversation
may
appear
i
understood
every
word
of
it
the
naturalist
had
brought
among
his
packs
a
small
keg
of
aguardiente
mezcal
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
any
new
species
of
the
lizard
or
snake
tribe
he
should
chance
to
fall
in
with
what
i
heard
then
was
neither
more
or
less
than
a
plot
to
steal
the
keg
and
its
contents
my
first
impulse
was
to
leap
up
and
stop
them
in
their
design
as
well
as
administer
a
salutary
rebuke
to
my
voyageur
and
his
companion
but
a
moment
reflection
convinced
me
that
they
could
be
better
punished
in
another
way
i
would
leave
them
to
punish
themselves
i
remembered
that
some
days
previous
to
our
reaching
the
ojo
de
vaca
the
doctor
had
captured
a
snake
of
the
adder
kind
two
or
three
species
of
lizards
and
a
animal
called
in
hunter
phraseology
the
horned
frog
the
of
texas
and
mexico
these
he
had
immersed
in
the
spirit
for
preservation
i
had
observed
him
do
so
and
it
was
evident
that
neither
my
frenchman
nor
the
irishman
had
any
idea
of
this
i
adopted
the
resolution
therefore
to
let
them
drink
a
full
bumper
of
the
pickle
before
i
should
interfere
knowing
that
they
would
soon
return
i
remained
where
i
was
i
had
not
long
to
wait
upon
them
in
a
few
minutes
they
came
up
barney
carrying
what
i
knew
to
be
the
devoted
keg
they
sat
down
close
to
where
i
lay
and
prising
out
the
bung
filled
the
liquor
into
their
tin
cups
and
commenced
imbibing
a
drouthier
pair
of
mortals
could
not
have
been
found
anywhere
and
at
the
first
draught
each
emptied
his
cup
to
the
bottom
it
has
a
quare
taste
has
it
said
barney
after
he
had
taken
the
vessel
from
his
lips
oui
vrai
monsieur
what
dev
ye
think
it
is
je
ne
sais

it

i

to

but

but
that
the
raal

here
the
irishman
shook
his
head
to
express
with
more
emphasis
his
admiration
of
the
native

continued
he

and
the
speaker
held
out
his
tin
vessel
to
be
replenished
gode
lifted
the
keg
and
emptied
more
of
its
contents
into
their
cups

poison
and
the
brace
of
revellers
went
staggering
over
the
azotea
delivering
their
stomachs
and
ejaculating
in
extreme
terror
as
the
thought
struck
them
that
there
might
be
poison
in
the
pickle
i
had
risen
to
my
feet
and
was
enjoying
the
joke
in
loud
laughter
this
and
the
exclamations
of
the
men
brought
a
crowd
of
hunters
up
to
the
roof
who
as
soon
as
they
perceived
what
had
happened
joined
in
and
made
the
ruin
ring
with
their
wild
peals
the
doctor
who
had
come
up
among
the
rest
was
not
so
well
satisfied
with
the
occurrence
after
a
short
search
however
the
lizards
were
found
and
returned
to
the
keg
which
still
contained
enough
of
the
spirit
for
his
purposes
it
was
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
again
even
by
the
thirstiest
hunter
in
the
band
chapter
thirty
four
the
phantom
city
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
our
spies
came
in
and
reported
that
the
navajoes
had
taken
the
southern
trail
they
had
returned
to
the
spring
on
the
second
day
after
our
leaving
it
and
thence
had
followed
the
guiding
of
the
arrows
it
was
band
in
all
about
three
hundred
warriors
nothing
remained
for
us
now
but
to
pack
up
as
quickly
as
possible
and
pursue
our
march
to
the
north
in
an
hour
we
were
in
our
saddles
and
following
the
rocky
banks
of
the
san
pedro
a
long
day
journey
brought
us
to
the
desolate
valley
of
the
gila
upon
whose
waters
we
encamped
for
the
night
we
slept
near
the
celebrated
ruins
the
second
of
the
migrating
aztecs
with
the
exception
of
the
botanist
the
coco
chief
myself
and
perhaps
seguin
no
one
in
the
band
seemed
to
trouble
himself
about
these
interesting
antiquities
the
sign
of
grizzly
bears
that
was
discovered
upon
the
mud
bottom
gave
the
hunters
far
more
concern
than
the
broken
pottery
and
its
painted
hieroglyphics
two
of
these
animals
were
discovered
near
the
camp
and
a
fierce
battle
ensued
in
which
one
of
the
mexicans
nearly
lost
his
life
escaping
only
after
most
of
the
skin
had
been
clawed
from
his
head
and
neck
the
bears
themselves
were
killed
and
made
part
of
our
suppers
our
next
day
march
lay
up
the
gila
to
the
mouth
of
the
san
carlos
river
where
we
again
halted
for
the
night
the
san
carlos
runs
in
from
the
north
and
seguin
had
resolved
to
travel
up
this
stream
for
a
hundred
miles
or
so
and
afterwards
strike
eastward
to
the
country
of
the
navajoes
when
this
determination
was
made
known
a
spirit
of
discontent
showed
itself
among
the
men
and
mutinous
whisperings
were
heard
on
all
sides
shortly
after
we
halted
however
several
of
them
strayed
up
the
banks
of
the
stream
and
gathered
some
grains
of
gold
out
of
its
bed
indications
of
the
precious
metal
the
quixa
known
among
the
mexicans
as
the
gold
mother
were
also
found
among
the
rocks
there
were
miners
in
the
band
who
knew
it
well
and
this
served
to
satisfy
them
there
was
no
more
talk
of
keeping
on
to
the
prieto
perhaps
the
san
carlos
might
prove
equally
rich
rumour
had
also
given
it
the
title
of
a
golden
river
at
all
events
the
expedition
must
cross
the
head
waters
of
the
prieto
in
its
journey
eastward
and
this
prospect
had
the
effect
of
quieting
the
mutineers
at
least
for
the
time
there
was
another
influence
the
character
of
seguin
there
was
no
single
individual
in
the
band
who
cared
to
cross
him
on
slight
grounds
they
knew
him
too
well
for
that
and
though
few
of
these
men
set
high
value
on
their
lives
when
they
believe
themselves
according
to
mountain
law
in
the
right
yet
they
knew
that
to
delay
the
expedition
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
gold
was
neither
according
to
their
compact
with
him
nor
agreeable
to
his
wishes
not
a
few
of
the
band
moreover
were
actuated
by
motives
similar
to
those
felt
by
seguin
himself
and
these
were
equally
desirous
of
pushing
on
to
the
navajo
towns
still
another
consideration
had
its
influence
upon
the
majority
the
party
of
dacoma
would
be
on
our
track
as
soon
as
they
had
returned
from
the
apache
trail
we
had
therefore
no
time
to
waste
in
and
the
simplest
of
the
knew
this
by
daybreak
we
were
again
on
the
march
and
riding
up
the
banks
of
the
san
carlos
we
had
now
entered
the
great
desert
which
stretches
northward
from
the
gila
away
to
the
head
waters
of
the
colorado
we
entered
it
without
a
guide
for
not
one
of
the
band
had
ever
traversed
these
unknown
regions
even
rube
knew
nothing
about
this
part
of
the
country
we
were
without
compass
too
but
this
we
heeded
not
there
were
few
in
the
band
who
could
not
point
to
the
north
or
the
south
within
the
variation
of
a
degree
few
of
them
but
could
night
or
day
tell
by
the
heavens
within
ten
minutes
of
the
true
time
give
them
but
a
clear
sky
with
the
signs
of
the
trees
and
rocks
and
they
needed
neither
compass
nor
chronometer
a
life
spent
beneath
the
blue
heavens
of
the
prairie
uplands
and
the
mountain
parks
where
a
roof
rarely
obstructed
their
view
of
the
azure
vaults
had
made
astronomers
of
these
reckless
rovers
of
such
accomplishments
was
their
education
drawn
from
many
a
perilous
experience
to
me
their
knowledge
of
such
things
seemed
instinct
but
we
had
a
guide
as
to
our
direction
unerring
as
the
magnetic
needle
we
were
traversing
the
region
of
the
polar
plant
the
planes
of
whose
leaves
at
almost
every
step
pointed
out
our
meridian
it
grew
upon
our
track
and
was
crushed
under
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
as
we
rode
onward
we
travelled
northward
through
a
country
of
mountains
whose
tops
shot
heavenward
in
fantastic
forms
and
groupings
at
one
time
we
saw
shapes
like
the
domes
of
churches
at
another
gothic
turrets
rose
before
us
and
the
next
opening
brought
in
view
sharp
peaks
shooting
upward
into
the
blue
sky
we
saw
columnar
forms
supporting
others
that
lay
horizontally
vast
boulders
of
suggesting
the
idea
of
some
antediluvian
ruin
some
temple
of
gigantic
druids
along
with
singularity
of
formation
was
the
most
brilliant
colouring
there
were
stratified
rocks
red
white
green
and
yellow
as
vivid
in
their
hues
as
if
freshly
touched
from
the
palette
of
the
painter
no
smoke
had
tarnished
them
since
they
had
been
flung
up
from
their
subterranean
beds
no
cloud
draped
their
naked
outlines
it
was
not
a
land
of
clouds
for
as
we
journeyed
amongst
them
we
saw
not
a
speck
in
the
heavens
nothing
above
us
but
the
blue
and
limitless
ether
i
remembered
the
remarks
of
seguin
there
was
something
inspiriting
in
the
sight
of
these
bright
mountains
something
that
prevented
us
from
feeling
the
extreme
and
real
desolation
by
which
we
were
surrounded
at
times
we
could
not
help
fancying
that
we
were
in
a
country
a
country
of
vast
wealth
and
civilisation
as
appeared
from
its
architectural
grandeur
yet
in
reality
we
were
journeying
through
the
wildest
of
dominions
where
no
human
foot
ever
trod
excepting
such
as
wear
the
moccasin
the
region
of
the
wolf
apache
and
the
wretched
yamparico
we
travelled
up
the
banks
of
the
river
and
here
and
there
at
our
searching
for
the
shining
metal
it
could
be
found
only
in
small
quantities
and
the
hunters
began
to
talk
loudly
of
the
prieto
there
according
to
them
the
yellow
gold
lay
in
lumps
on
the
fourth
day
after
leaving
the
gila
we
came
to
a
place
where
the
san
carlos
canoned
through
a
high
sierra
here
we
halted
for
the
night
when
morning
came
we
found
we
could
follow
the
river
no
farther
without
climbing
over
the
mountain
and
seguin
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
it
and
striking
eastward
the
hunters
responded
to
this
declaration
with
a
joyous
hurrah
the
golden
vision
was
again
before
them
we
remained
at
the
san
carlos
until
after
the
noon
heat
recruiting
our
horses
by
the
stream
then
mounting
we
rode
forward
into
the
plain
it
was
our
intention
to
travel
all
night
or
until
we
reached
water
as
we
knew
that
without
this
halting
would
be
useless
we
had
not
ridden
far
until
we
saw
that
a
fearful
jornada
was
before
us
one
of
those
dreaded
stretches
without
grass
wood
or
water
ahead
of
us
we
could
see
a
low
range
of
mountains
trending
from
north
to
south
and
beyond
these
another
range
still
higher
than
the
first
on
the
farther
range
there
were
snowy
summits
we
saw
that
they
were
distinct
chains
and
that
the
more
distant
was
of
great
elevation
this
we
knew
from
the
appearance
upon
its
peaks
of
the
eternal
snow
we
knew
moreover
that
at
the
foot
of
the
snowy
range
we
should
find
water
perhaps
the
river
we
were
in
search
of
but
the
distance
was
immense
if
we
did
not
find
it
at
the
nearer
sierra
we
should
have
an
adventure
the
danger
of
perishing
from
thirst
such
was
the
prospect
we
rode
on
over
the
arid
soil
over
plains
of
lava
and
that
wounded
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
laming
many
there
was
no
vegetation
around
us
except
the
sickly
green
of
the
artemisia
or
the
fetid
foliage
of
the
creosote
plant
there
was
no
living
thing
to
be
seen
save
the
brown
and
hideous
lizard
the
rattlesnake
and
the
desert
crickets
that
crawled
in
myriads
along
the
parched
ground
and
were
crunched
under
the
hoofs
of
our
animals
water
was
the
word
that
began
to
be
uttered
in
several
languages
water
cried
the
choking
trapper
ejaculated
the
canadian
agua
agua
shouted
the
mexican
we
were
not
twenty
miles
from
the
san
carlos
before
our
gourd
canteens
were
as
dry
as
a
shingle
the
dust
of
the
plains
and
the
hot
atmosphere
had
created
unusual
thirst
and
we
had
soon
emptied
them
we
had
started
late
in
the
afternoon
at
sundown
the
mountains
ahead
of
us
did
not
seem
a
single
mile
nearer
we
travelled
all
night
and
when
the
sun
rose
again
we
were
still
a
good
distance
from
them
such
is
the
illusory
character
of
this
elevated
and
crystal
atmosphere
the
men
mumbled
as
they
talked
they
held
in
their
mouths
leaden
bullets
and
pebbles
of
obsidian
which
they
chewed
with
a
desperate
fierceness
it
was
some
time
after
sunrise
when
we
arrived
at
the
mountain
foot
to
our
consternation
no
water
could
be
found
the
mountains
were
a
range
of
dry
rocks
so
and
barren
that
even
the
creosote
bush
could
not
find
nourishment
along
their
sides
they
were
as
naked
of
vegetation
as
when
the
volcanic
fires
first
heaved
them
into
the
light
parties
scattered
in
all
directions
and
went
up
the
ravines
but
after
a
long
while
spent
in
fruitless
wandering
we
abandoned
the
search
in
despair
there
was
a
pass
that
appeared
to
lead
through
the
range
and
entering
this
we
rode
forward
in
silence
and
with
gloomy
thoughts
we
soon
debouched
on
the
other
side
when
a
scene
of
singular
character
burst
upon
our
view
a
plain
lay
before
us
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
by
high
mountains
on
its
farther
edge
was
the
snowy
ridge
with
stupendous
cliffs
rising
vertically
from
the
plain
towering
thousands
of
feet
in
height
dark
rocks
seemed
piled
upon
each
other
higher
and
higher
until
they
became
buried
under
robes
of
the
spotless
snow
but
that
which
appeared
most
singular
was
the
surface
of
the
plain
it
was
covered
with
a
mantle
of
virgin
whiteness
apparently
of
snow
and
yet
the
more
elevated
spot
from
which
we
viewed
it
was
naked
with
a
hot
sun
shining
upon
it
what
we
saw
in
the
valley
then
could
not
be
snow
as
i
gazed
over
the
monotonous
surface
of
this
plain
and
then
looked
upon
the
chaotic
mountains
that
walled
it
in
my
mind
became
impressed
with
ideas
of
coldness
and
desolation
it
seemed
as
if
everything
was
dead
around
us
and
nature
was
laid
out
in
her
i
saw
that
my
companions
experienced
similar
feelings
but
no
one
spoke
and
we
commenced
riding
down
the
pass
that
led
into
this
singular
valley
as
far
as
we
could
see
there
was
no
prospect
of
water
on
the
plain
but
what
else
could
we
do
than
cross
it
on
its
most
distant
border
along
the
base
of
the
snowy
mountains
we
thought
we
could
distinguish
a
black
line
like
that
of
timber
and
for
this
point
we
directed
our
march
on
reaching
the
plain
what
had
appeared
like
snow
proved
to
be
soda
a
deep
incrustation
of
this
lay
upon
the
ground
enough
to
satisfy
the
wants
of
the
whole
human
race
yet
there
it
lay
and
no
hand
had
ever
stooped
to
gather
it
three
or
four
rocky
buttes
were
in
our
way
near
the
debouchure
of
the
pass
as
we
rounded
them
getting
farther
out
into
the
plain
a
wide
gap
began
to
unfold
itself
opening
through
the
mountains
beyond
through
this
gap
the
sun
rays
were
streaming
in
throwing
a
band
of
yellow
light
across
one
end
of
the
valley
in
this
the
crystals
of
the
soda
stirred
up
by
the
breeze
appeared
floating
in
myriads
as
we
descended
i
observed
that
objects
began
to
assume
a
very
different
aspect
from
what
they
had
exhibited
from
above
as
if
by
enchantment
the
cold
snowy
surface
all
at
once
disappeared
green
fields
lay
before
us
and
tall
trees
sprang
up
covered
with
a
thick
and
verdant
frondage
cried
a
hunter
as
his
eye
rested
on
these
still
distant
groves
tall
saplins
at
that
wagh
ejaculated
another
water

i
reckin
remarked
a

a
single
shanty
gee
jim
look
yonder
wagh
i
was
riding
in
front
with
seguin
the
rest
of
the
band
strung
out
behind
us
i
had
been
for
some
time
gazing
upon
the
ground
in
a
sort
of
abstraction
looking
at
the
efflorescence
and
listening
to
the
crunching
of
my
horse
hoofs
through
its
icy
incrustation
these
exclamatory
phrases
caused
me
to
raise
my
eyes
the
sight
that
met
them
was
one
that
made
me
rein
up
with
a
sudden
jerk
seguin
had
done
the
same
and
i
saw
that
the
whole
band
had
halted
with
a
similar
impulse
we
had
just
cleared
one
of
the
buttes
that
had
hitherto
obstructed
our
view
of
the
great
gap
this
was
now
directly
in
front
of
us
and
along
its
base
on
the
southern
side
rose
the
walls
and
battlements
of
a
city
a
vast
city
judging
from
its
distance
and
the
colossal
appearance
of
its
architecture
we
could
trace
the
columns
of
temples
and
doors
and
gates
and
windows
and
balconies
and
parapets
and
spires
there
were
many
towers
rising
high
over
the
roofs
and
in
the
middle
was
a
structure
with
its
massive
dome
towering
far
above
all
the
others
i
looked
upon
this
sudden
apparition
with
a
feeling
of
incredulity
it
was
a
dream
an
imagination
a
mirage
ha
it
was
the
mirage
no
the
mirage
could
not
effect
such
a
complete
picture
there
were
the
roofs
and
chimneys
and
walls
and
windows
there
were
the
parapets
of
fortified
houses
with
their
regular
notches
and
embrasures
it
was
a
reality
it
was
a
city
was
it
the
cibolo
of
the
spanish
padre
was
it
that
city
of
golden
gates
and
burnished
towers
after
all
was
the
story
of
the
wandering
priest
true
who
had
proved
it
a
fable
who
had
ever
penetrated
this
region
the
very
country
in
which
the
ecclesiastic
represented
the
golden
city
of
cibolo
to
exist
i
saw
that
seguin
was
puzzled
dismayed
as
well
as
myself
he
knew
nothing
of
this
land
he
had
never
witnessed
a
mirage
like
that
for
some
time
we
sat
in
our
saddles
influenced
by
strange
emotions
shall
we
go
forward
yes
we
must
reach
water
we
are
dying
of
thirst
and
impelled
by
this
we
spur
onward
we
had
ridden
only
a
few
paces
farther
when
the
hunters
uttered
a
sudden
and
simultaneous
cry
a
new
object
an
object
of
terror
was
before
us
along
the
mountain
foot
appeared
a
string
of
dark
forms
they
were
mounted
men
we
dragged
our
horses
to
their
haunches
our
whole
line
halting
as
one
man
injuns
was
the
exclamation
of
several
indians
they
must
be
muttered
seguin
there
are
no
others
here
indians
no
there
never
were
such
as
them
see
they
are
not
men
look
their
huge
horses
their
long
guns
they
are
giants
by
heaven
continued
he
after
a
moment
pause
they
are
bodiless
they
are
phantoms
there
were
exclamations
of
terror
from
the
hunters
behind
were
these
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
there
was
a
striking
proportion
in
the
colossal
size
of
the
horses
and
the
horsemen
for
a
moment
i
was
like
the
rest
only
a
moment
a
sudden
memory
flashed
upon
me
i
thought
of
the
hartz
mountains
and
their
demons
i
knew
that
the
phenomenon
before
us
could
be
no
other
an
optical
delusion
a
creation
of
the
mirage
i
raised
my
hand
above
my
head
the
foremost
of
the
giants
imitated
the
motion
i
put
spurs
to
my
horse
and
galloped
forward
so
did
he
as
if
to
meet
me
after
a
few
springs
i
had
passed
the
refracting
angle
and
like
a
thought
the
shadowy
giants
vanished
into
the
air
the
men
had
ridden
forward
after
me
and
having
also
passed
the
angle
of
refraction
saw
no
more
of
the
phantom
host
the
city
too
had
disappeared
but
we
could
trace
the
outlines
of
many
a
singular
formation
in
the
strata
that
traversed
the
edge
of
the
valley
the
tall
groves
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
but
a
low
belt
of
green
willows
real
willows
could
be
distinguished
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
within
the
gap
under
their
foliage
there
was
something
that
sparkled
in
the
sun
like
sheets
of
silver
it
was
water
it
was
a
branch
of
the
prieto
our
horses
neighed
at
the
sight
and
shortly
after
we
had
alighted
upon
its
banks
and
were
kneeling
before
the
sweet
spirit
of
the
stream
chapter
thirty
five
the
mountain
of
gold
after
so
fatiguing
a
march
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
longer
halt
than
usual
we
stayed
by
the
arroyo
all
that
day
and
the
following
night
but
the
hunters
longed
to
drink
from
the
prieto
itself
and
the
next
morning
we
drew
our
pickets
and
rode
in
the
direction
of
that
river
by
noon
we
were
upon
its
banks
a
singular
stream
it
was
running
through
a
region
of
bleak
barren
and
desolate
mountains
through
these
the
stream
had
forged
its
way
by
numerous
canons
and
rushed
along
a
channel
at
most
places
inaccessible
it
was
a
black
and
gloomy
river
where
were
its
sands
of
gold
after
riding
for
some
distance
along
its
banks
we
halted
at
a
point
where
its
bed
could
be
reached
the
hunters
disregarding
all
else
clambered
eagerly
over
the
steep
bluffs
and
descended
to
the
water
they
hardly
stayed
to
drink
they
crawled
through
narrow
interstices
between
detached
masses
of
rock
that
had
fallen
from
above
they
lifted
the
mud
in
their
hands
and
washed
it
in
their
cups
they
hammered
the
quartz
rock
with
their
tomahawks
and
pounded
it
between
great
stones
not
a
particle
of
the
precious
metal
could
be
found
they
must
either
have
struck
the
river
too
high
up
or
else
the
el
dorado
lay
still
farther
to
the
north
wet
weary
angry
uttering
oaths
and
expressions
of
disappointment
they
obeyed
the
signal
to
march
forward
we
rode
up
the
stream
halting
for
the
night
at
another
place
where
the
water
was
accessible
to
our
animals
here
the
hunters
again
searched
for
gold
and
again
found
it
not
mutinous
murmurs
were
now
spoken
aloud
the
gold
country
lay
below
them
they
had
no
doubt
of
it
the
chief
took
them
by
the
san
carlos
on
purpose
to
disappoint
them
he
knew
this
would
prevent
delay
he
cared
not
for
them
his
own
ends
were
all
he
wanted
to
accomplish
they
might
go
back
as
poor
as
they
had
come
for
aught
he
cared
they
would
never
have
so
good
a
chance
again
such
were
their
mutterings
embellished
with
many
an
oath
seguin
either
heard
not
or
did
not
heed
them
he
was
one
of
those
characters
who
can
patiently
bear
until
a
proper
cue
for
action
may
offer
itself
he
was
fiery
by
nature
like
all
creoles
but
time
and
trials
had
tempered
him
to
that
calmness
and
coolness
that
befitted
the
leader
of
such
a
band
when
roused
to
action
he
became
what
is
styled
in
western
phraseology
a
dangerous
man
and
the
knew
it
he
heeded
not
their
murmurings
long
before
daybreak
we
were
once
more
in
our
saddles
and
moving
onward
still
up
the
prieto
we
had
observed
fires
at
a
distance
during
the
night
and
we
knew
that
they
were
at
the
villages
of
the
club
apache
we
wished
to
pass
their
country
without
being
seen
and
it
was
our
intention
when
daylight
appeared
to
cacher
among
the
rocks
until
the
following
night
as
dawn
advanced
we
halted
in
a
concealed
ravine
whilst
several
of
us
climbed
the
hill
to
reconnoitre
we
could
see
the
smoke
rising
over
the
distant
villages
but
we
had
passed
them
in
the
darkness
and
instead
of
remaining
in
cache
we
continued
on
through
a
wide
plain
covered
with
sage
and
cactus
plants
mountains
towered
up
on
every
side
of
us
as
we
advanced
they
rose
directly
from
the
plains
exhibiting
the
fantastic
shapes
which
characterise
them
in
those
regions
their
stupendous
precipices
overlooked
the
bleak
barren
tables
frowning
upon
them
in
sublime
silence
the
plains
themselves
ran
into
the
very
bases
of
these
cliffs
water
had
surely
washed
them
these
plateaux
had
once
been
the
bed
of
an
ancient
ocean
i
remembered
seguin
theory
of
the
inland
seas
shortly
after
sunrise
the
trail
we
were
following
led
us
to
an
indian
crossing
here
we
forded
the
stream
with
the
intention
of
leaving
it
and
heading
eastward
we
halted
our
horses
in
the
water
permitting
them
to
drink
freely
some
of
the
hunters
moving
ahead
of
the
rest
had
climbed
the
high
banks
we
were
attracted
by
their
unusual
exclamations
on
looking
upward
we
perceived
several
of
them
standing
on
the
top
of
a
hill
and
pointing
to
the
north
in
an
earnest
and
excited
manner
could
it
be
indians
what
is
it
shouted
seguin
as
we
pushed
forward
a
gold
mountain
a
gold
mountain
was
the
reply
we
spurred
our
horses
hurriedly
up
the
hill
on
reaching
its
top
a
strange
sight
met
our
gaze
away
to
the
north
and
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
an
object
glistened
in
the
sun
it
was
a
mountain
and
along
its
sides
from
base
to
summit
the
rocks
glittered
with
the
bright
semblance
of
gold
a
thousand
jets
danced
in
the
sunbeams
dazzling
the
eye
as
it
looked
upon
them
was
it
a
mountain
of
gold
the
men
were
in
a
frenzy
of
delight
this
was
the
mountain
so
often
discussed
over
the
bivouac
fires
who
of
them
had
not
heard
of
it
whether
credulous
or
not
it
was
no
fable
then
there
it
was
before
them
in
all
its
burning
splendour
i
turned
to
look
at
seguin
his
brow
was
bent
there
was
the
expression
of
anxiety
on
his
countenance
he
understood
the
illusion
so
did
the
maricopa
so
did
reichter
i
knew
it
too
at
a
glance
i
had
recognised
the
sparkling
scales
of
the
selenite
seguin
saw
that
there
was
a
difficulty
before
us
this
dazzling
hallucination
lay
far
out
of
our
course
but
it
was
evident
that
neither
commands
nor
persuasion
would
be
heeded
now
the
men
were
resolved
upon
reaching
it
some
of
them
had
already
turned
their
horses
heads
and
were
moving
in
that
direction
seguin
ordered
them
back
a
stormy
altercation
ensued
in
short
a
mutiny
in
vain
seguin
urged
the
necessity
of
our
hastening
forward
to
the
town
in
vain
he
represented
the
danger
we
were
in
of
being
overtaken
by
dacoma
party
who
by
this
time
were
upon
our
trail
in
vain
the
coco
chief
the
doctor
and
myself
assured
our
uneducated
companions
that
what
they
saw
was
but
the
glancing
surface
of
a
worthless
rock
the
men
were
obstinate
the
sight
operating
upon
hopes
had
intoxicated
them
they
had
lost
all
reason
they
were
mad
on
then
cried
seguin
making
a
desperate
effort
to
restrain
his
passion
on
madmen
and
satisfy
yourselves
our
lives
may
answer
for
your
folly
and
so
saying
he
turned
his
horse
and
headed
him
for
the
shining
beacon
the
men
rode
after
uttering
loud
and
joyful
acclamations
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
ride
we
reached
the
base
of
the
mountain
the
hunters
leaped
from
their
horses
and
clambered
up
to
the
glittering
rocks
they
reached
them
they
broke
them
with
their
tomahawks
and
and
cleft
them
with
their
knives
they
tore
off
the
plates
of
mica
and
glassy
selenite
they
flung
them
at
their
feet
abashed
and
mortified
and
one
after
another
came
back
to
the
plain
with
looks
of
disappointment
and
chagrin
not
one
of
them
said
a
word
as
they
climbed
into
their
saddles
and
rode
sullenly
after
the
chief
we
had
lost
a
day
by
this
bootless
journey
but
our
consolation
lay
in
the
belief
that
our
indian
pursuers
following
upon
our
trail
would
make
the
same
detour
our
course
now
lay
to
the
but
finding
a
spring
not
far
from
the
foot
of
the
mountain
we
remained
by
it
for
the
night
after
another
day
march
in
a
course
rube
recognised
the
profiles
of
the
mountains
we
were
nearing
the
great
town
of
the
navajoes
that
night
we
encamped
on
a
running
water
a
branch
of
the
prieto
that
headed
to
the
eastward
a
vast
chasm
between
two
cliffs
marked
the
course
of
the
stream
above
us
the
guide
pointed
into
the
gap
as
we
rode
forward
to
our
what
is
it
rube
inquired
seguin
see
that
gully
ahead
o
us
yes
what
of
it
the
town
thur
chapter
thirty
six
navajoa
it
was
near
evening
of
the
next
day
when
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
sierra
at
the
debouchure
of
the
canon
we
could
not
follow
the
stream
any
farther
as
there
was
no
path
by
the
channel
it
would
be
necessary
to
pass
over
the
ridge
that
formed
the
southern
jaw
of
the
chasm
there
was
a
plain
trail
among
scrubby
pines
and
following
our
guide
we
commenced
riding
up
the
mountain
after
ascending
for
an
hour
or
so
by
a
fearful
road
along
the
very
brink
of
the
precipice
we
climbed
the
crest
of
the
ridge
and
looked
eastward
we
had
reached
the
goal
of
our
journey
the
town
of
the
navajoes
was
before
us
voila
mira
el
pueblo
thar
the
town
hurrah
were
the
exclamations
that
broke
from
the
hunters
oh
god
at
last
it
is
muttered
seguin
with
a
singular
expression
of
countenance
oh
god
be
praised
halt
comrades
halt
our
reins
were
tightened
and
we
sat
on
our
weary
horses
looking
over
the
plain
a
magnificent
panorama
magnificent
under
any
circumstances
lay
before
us
but
its
interest
was
heightened
by
the
peculiar
circumstances
under
which
we
viewed
it
we
are
at
the
western
extremity
of
an
oblong
valley
looking
up
it
lengthwise
it
is
not
a
valley
though
so
called
in
the
language
of
spanish
america
but
a
plain
walled
in
on
all
sides
by
mountains
it
is
elliptical
in
form
the
diameter
of
its
foci
being
ten
or
twelve
miles
in
length
its
shortest
diameter
is
five
or
six
miles
it
has
the
surface
of
a
green
meadow
and
its
perfect
level
is
unbroken
by
brake
bush
or
hillock
it
looks
like
some
quiet
lake
transformed
into
an
emerald
it
is
bisected
by
a
line
of
silvery
brightness
that
curves
gracefully
through
its
whole
extent
marking
the
windings
of
a
crystal
stream
but
the
mountains
what
mountains
particularly
those
on
the
north
side
of
the
valley
they
are
granite
upheaved
nature
must
have
warred
at
the
birth
of
these
the
very
sight
of
them
suggests
the
throes
of
a
troubled
planet
huge
rocks
hang
over
only
half
resting
upon
fearful
precipices
vast
boulders
that
seem
as
though
the
touch
of
a
feather
would
cause
them
to
topple
down
grim
chasms
open
into
deep
dark
defiles
that
lie
silent
and
solemn
and
frowning
here
and
there
stunted
trees
the
cedar
and
pinon
hang
horizontally
out
clinging
along
the
cliffs
the
unsightly
limbs
of
the
cactus
and
the
gloomy
foliage
of
the
creosote
bush
grow
together
in
seams
of
the
rocks
heightening
their
character
of
ruggedness
and
gloom
such
is
the
southern
barrier
of
the
valley
look
upon
the
northern
sierra
here
is
a
contrast
a
new
geology
not
a
rock
of
granite
meets
the
eye
but
there
are
others
piled
as
high
and
glistening
with
the
whiteness
of
snow
these
are
mountains
of
the
milky
quartz
they
exhibit
a
variety
of
peaks
naked
and
shining
crags
that
hang
over
deep
treeless
ravines
and
summits
aspiring
to
the
sky
they
too
have
their
vegetation
a
vegetation
that
suggests
ideas
of
the
desert
and
desolation
the
two
sierras
appear
to
converge
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
valley
we
are
upon
a
transverse
ridge
that
shuts
it
in
upon
the
west
and
from
this
point
we
view
the
picture
where
the
valley
ends
eastwardly
we
perceive
a
dark
background
lying
up
against
the
mountains
we
know
it
is
a
but
we
are
at
too
great
a
distance
to
distinguish
the
trees
out
of
this
forest
the
stream
appears
to
issue
and
upon
its
banks
near
the
border
of
the
woods
we
perceive
a
collection
of
strange
pyramidal
structures
they
are
houses
it
is
the
town
of
navajoa
our
eyes
were
directed
upon
it
with
eager
gaze
we
could
trace
the
outlines
of
the
houses
though
they
stood
nearly
ten
miles
distant
they
suggested
images
of
a
strange
architecture
there
were
some
standing
apart
from
the
rest
with
terraced
roofs
and
we
could
see
there
were
banners
waving
over
them
one
larger
than
the
rest
presented
the
appearance
of
a
temple
it
was
out
on
the
open
plain
and
by
the
glass
we
could
detect
numerous
forms
clustered
upon
its
top
the
forms
of
human
beings
there
were
others
upon
the
roofs
and
parapets
of
the
smaller
houses
and
many
more
moving
upon
the
plain
nearer
us
driving
before
them
flocks
of
animals
mules
and
mustangs
some
were
down
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
and
others
we
could
see
plunging
about
in
the
water
several
droves
of
horses
whose
mottled
flanks
showed
their
breed
were
quietly
browsing
on
the
open
prairie
flocks
of
wild
swans
geese
and
gruyas
winged
their
way
up
and
down
the
meandering
current
of
the
stream
the
sun
was
setting
the
mountains
were
tinged
with
an
light
and
the
quartzose
crystals
sparkled
on
the
peaks
of
the
southern
sierra
it
was
a
scene
of
silent
beauty
how
long
thought
i
ere
its
silence
would
be
broken
by
the
sounds
of
ravage
and
ruin
we
remained
for
some
time
gazing
up
the
valley
without
anyone
uttering
his
thoughts
it
was
the
silence
that
precedes
resolve
in
the
minds
of
my
companions
there
were
varied
emotions
at
play
varied
in
kind
as
they
differed
in
intensity
some
were
holy
men
sat
straining
their
eyes
over
the
long
reach
of
meadow
thinking
or
fancying
that
in
the
distance
they
might
distinguish
a
loved
object
a
wife
a
sister
a
daughter
or
perhaps
the
object
of
a
still
dearer
and
deeper
affection
no
the
last
could
not
be
none
could
have
been
more
deeply
affected
than
he
who
was
seeking
for
his
child
a
father
love
was
the
strongest
passion
there
alas
there
were
other
emotions
in
the
bosoms
of
those
around
me
passions
dark
and
sinful
fierce
looks
were
bent
upon
the
town
some
of
these
betokened
fierce
feelings
of
revenge
others
indicated
the
desire
of
plunder
and
others
still
spoke
of
murder
there
had
been
mutterings
of
this
from
day
to
day
as
we
journeyed
men
disappointed
in
their
golden
dreams
had
been
heard
to
talk
about
the
price
of
scalps
by
a
command
from
seguin
the
hunters
drew
back
among
the
trees
and
entered
into
a
hurried
council
how
was
the
town
to
be
taken
we
could
not
approach
it
in
the
open
light
the
inhabitants
would
see
us
before
we
could
ride
up
and
make
their
escape
to
the
forest
beyond
this
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
our
expedition
could
not
a
party
get
round
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
valley
and
prevent
this
not
through
the
plain
itself
for
the
mountains
rested
upon
its
surface
without
either
foothills
or
paths
along
their
sides
in
some
places
vast
cliffs
rose
to
the
height
of
a
thousand
feet
stepping
directly
upon
the
level
plain
this
idea
was
given
up
could
we
not
turn
the
southern
sierra
and
come
in
through
the
forest
itself
this
would
bring
us
close
to
the
houses
under
cover
the
guide
was
questioned
and
answered
in
the
affirmative
but
that
could
only
be
accomplished
by
making
a
detour
of
nearly
fifty
miles
we
had
no
time
for
such
a
journey
and
the
thought
was
abandoned
the
town
then
must
be
approached
in
the
night
this
was
the
only
plan
practicable
at
least
the
most
likely
to
succeed
it
was
adopted
it
was
not
seguin
intention
to
make
a
night
attack
but
only
to
surround
the
buildings
keeping
at
some
distance
out
and
remain
in
ambush
till
the
morning
all
retreat
would
thus
be
cut
off
and
we
should
make
sure
of
taking
our
captives
under
the
light
of
day
the
men
threw
themselves
to
the
ground
and
holding
their
bridles
waited
the
going
down
of
the
sun
chapter
thirty
seven
the
night
ambuscade
a
short
hour
passes
the
bright
orb
sinks
behind
us
and
the
quartz
rock
saddens
into
a
sombre
hue
the
straggling
rays
of
twilight
hover
but
a
moment
over
the
chalky
cliffs
and
then
vanish
away
it
is
night
descending
the
hills
in
a
long
string
we
arrive
upon
the
plain
we
turn
to
the
left
and
keep
round
the
mountain
foot
the
rocks
guide
us
we
proceed
with
caution
and
exchange
our
words
only
in
whispers
we
crawl
around
and
among
loose
boulders
that
have
fallen
from
above
we
turn
many
spurs
that
shoot
out
into
the
plain
occasionally
we
halt
and
hold
council
after
a
journey
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
we
find
ourselves
opposite
the
indian
town
we
are
not
over
a
mile
from
it
we
can
see
the
fires
burning
on
the
plain
and
hear
the
voices
of
those
who
move
around
them
at
this
point
the
band
is
divided
a
small
party
remains
making
its
cache
in
a
defile
among
the
rocks
these
guard
the
captive
chief
and
the
antajo
of
mules
the
rest
move
forward
guided
by
rube
who
carries
them
round
the
edge
of
the
forest
here
and
there
dropping
a
picket
of
several
men
as
he
proceeds
these
parties
conceal
themselves
at
their
respective
stations
remain
silent
and
wait
for
the
signal
from
the
bugle
which
is
to
be
given
at
the
hour
of
daybreak
the
night
passes
slowly
and
silently
the
fires
one
by
one
go
out
until
the
plain
is
wrapt
in
the
gloom
of
a
moonless
midnight
dark
clouds
travel
over
the
sky
portending
rain
a
rare
phenomenon
in
these
regions
the
swan
utters
its
wild
note
the
gruya
whoops
over
the
stream
and
the
wolf
howls
upon
the
skirts
of
the
sleeping
village
the
voice
of
the
wails
through
the
air
you
hear
the
flap
flap
of
his
long
wings
as
he
dashes
down
among
the
cocuyos
you
hear
the
on
the
hard
plain
the
crop
of
the
browsing
steed
and
the
tinkling
of
the
for
the
horses
eat
bridled
at
intervals
a
drowsy
hunter
mutters
through
his
sleep
battling
in
dreams
with
some
terrible
foe
thus
goes
the
night
these
are
its
voices
they
cease
as
daybreak
approaches
the
wolf
howls
no
longer
the
swan
and
the
blue
crane
are
silent
the
has
filled
his
ravenous
maw
and
perches
on
the
mountain
pine
the
disappear
chased
by
the
colder
hours
and
the
horses
having
eaten
what
grew
within
their
reach
stand
in
lounging
attitudes
asleep
a
grey
light
begins
to
steal
into
the
valley
it
flickers
along
the
white
cliffs
of
the
quartz
mountain
it
brings
with
it
a
raw
cold
air
that
awakens
the
hunters
one
by
one
they
arouse
themselves
they
shiver
as
they
stand
up
and
carry
their
blankets
wrapped
about
their
shoulders
they
feel
weary
and
look
pale
and
haggard
the
grey
dawn
lends
a
ghastly
hue
to
their
dusty
beards
and
unwashed
faces
after
a
short
while
they
coil
up
their
and
fasten
them
to
the
rings
they
look
to
their
flints
and
priming
and
tighten
the
buckles
of
their
belts
they
draw
forth
from
their
haversacks
pieces
of
dry
tasajo
eating
it
raw
they
stand
by
their
horses
ready
to
mount
it
is
not
yet
time
the
light
is
gathering
into
the
valley
the
blue
mist
that
hung
over
the
river
during
the
night
is
rising
upward
we
can
see
the
town
we
can
trace
the
odd
outlines
of
the
houses
what
strange
structures
they
are
some
of
them
are
higher
than
others
one
two
four
stories
in
height
they
are
each
in
form
like
a
pyramid
without
its
apex
each
upper
story
is
smaller
than
that
below
it
the
roofs
of
the
lower
ones
serving
as
terraces
for
those
above
they
are
of
a
whitish
yellow
the
colour
of
the
clay
out
of
which
they
are
built
they
are
without
windows
but
doors
lead
into
each
story
from
the
outside
and
ladders
stretch
from
terrace
to
terrace
leaning
against
the
walls
on
the
tops
of
some
there
are
poles
carrying
bannerets
these
are
the
residences
of
the
principal
and
great
warriors
of
the
nation
we
can
see
the
temple
distinctly
it
is
like
the
houses
in
shape
but
higher
and
of
larger
dimensions
there
is
a
tall
shaft
rising
out
of
its
roof
and
a
banner
with
a
strange
device
floating
at
its
peak
near
the
houses
we
see
corrals
filled
with
mules
and
mustangs
the
of
the
village
the
light
grows
stronger
forms
appear
upon
the
roofs
and
move
along
the
terraces
they
are
human
forms
enveloped
in
hanging
garments
and
striped
we
recognise
the
navajo
blanket
with
its
alternate
bands
of
black
and
white
with
the
glass
we
can
see
these
forms
more
distinctly
we
can
tell
their
sex
their
hair
hangs
loosely
upon
their
shoulders
and
far
down
their
backs
most
of
them
are
females
girls
and
women
there
are
many
children
too
there
are
men
and
old
a
few
other
men
appear
but
they
are
not
warriors
the
warriors
are
absent
they
come
down
the
ladders
descending
from
terrace
to
terrace
they
go
out
upon
the
plain
and
rekindle
the
fires
some
carry
earthen
vessels
ollas
upon
their
heads
and
pass
down
to
the
river
they
go
in
for
water
these
are
nearly
naked
we
can
see
their
brown
bodies
and
uncovered
breasts
they
are
slaves
see
the
old
men
are
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
temple
they
are
followed
by
women
and
children
some
in
white
others
in
costumes
these
are
girls
and
young
lads
the
children
of
the
chiefs
over
a
hundred
have
climbed
up
they
have
reached
the
highest
root
there
is
an
altar
near
the
staff
a
smoke
rolls
up
a
blaze
they
have
kindled
a
fire
upon
the
altar
listen
the
chant
of
voices
and
the
beat
of
an
indian
drum
the
sounds
cease
and
they
all
stand
motionless
and
apparently
silent
facing
to
the
east
what
does
it
mean
they
are
waiting
for
the
sun
to
appear
these
people
worship
him
the
hunters
interested
and
curious
strain
their
eyes
watching
the
ceremony
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
the
quartz
mountain
is
on
fire
it
is
the
first
flash
of
the
sun
the
peak
is
yellowing
downward
other
points
catch
the
brilliant
beams
they
have
struck
the
faces
of
the
devotees
see
there
are
white
faces
one
two
many
white
faces
both
of
women
and
girls
oh
god
grant
that
it
may
be
cries
seguin
hurriedly
putting
up
the
glass
and
raising
the
bugle
to
his
lips
a
few
wild
notes
peal
over
the
valley
the
horsemen
hear
the
signal
they
debouche
from
the
woods
and
the
defiles
of
the
mountains
they
gallop
over
the
plain
deploying
as
they
go
in
a
few
minutes
we
have
formed
the
arc
of
a
circle
concave
to
the
town
our
horses
heads
are
turned
inwards
and
we
ride
forward
closing
upon
the
walls
we
have
left
the
atajo
in
the
defile
the
captive
chief
too
guarded
by
a
few
of
the
men
the
notes
of
the
bugle
have
summoned
the
attention
of
the
inhabitants
they
stand
for
a
while
in
amazement
and
without
motion
they
behold
the
deploying
of
the
line
they
see
the
horsemen
ride
inward
could
it
be
a
mock
surprise
of
some
friendly
tribe
no
that
strange
voice
the
bugle
is
new
to
indian
ears
yet
some
of
them
have
heard
it
before
they
know
it
to
be
the
of
the
for
awhile
their
consternation
hinders
them
from
action
they
stand
looking
on
until
we
are
near
then
they
behold
strange
armour
and
horses
singularly
caparisoned
it
is
the
white
enemy
they
run
from
point
to
point
from
street
to
street
those
who
carry
water
dash
down
their
ollas
and
rush
screaming
to
the
houses
they
climb
to
the
roofs
drawing
the
ladders
after
them
shouts
are
exchanged
and
exclamations
uttered
in
the
voices
of
men
women
and
children
terror
is
on
every
face
terror
displays
itself
in
every
movement
meanwhile
our
line
has
approached
until
we
are
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
walls
we
halt
for
a
moment
twenty
men
are
left
as
an
outer
guard
the
rest
of
us
thrown
into
a
body
ride
forward
following
our
leader
chapter
thirty
eight
adele
we
direct
ourselves
to
the
great
building
and
surrounding
it
again
halt
the
old
men
are
still
upon
the
roof
standing
along
the
parapet
they
are
frightened
and
tremble
like
children
do
not
fear
we
are
friends
cried
seguin
speaking
in
a
strange
language
and
making
signs
to
them
his
voice
is
not
heard
amidst
the
shrieks
and
shouting
that
still
continue
the
words
are
repeated
and
the
sign
given
in
a
more
emphatic
manner
the
old
men
crowd
along
the
edge
of
the
parapet
there
is
one
among
them
who
differs
from
the
rest
his
hair
reaches
below
his
waist
there
are
bright
ornaments
hanging
from
his
ears
and
over
his
breast
he
is
attired
in
white
robes
he
appears
to
be
a
chief
for
the
rest
obey
him
he
makes
a
signal
with
his
hands
and
the
screaming
subsides
he
stands
forward
on
the
parapet
as
if
to
speak
to
us
amigos
amigos

he
speaking
in
spanish

the
skinless
head
is
discovered
to
the
gaze
of
the
indians
a
murmur
indicative
of
alarm
is
heard
among
them
the
chief
seems
disconcerted
he
knows
the
history
of
that
scalp
a
murmur
too
runs
through
the
ranks
of
the
hunters
they
had
seen
white
faces
as
they
rode
up
the
lie
exasperates
them
and
the
ominous
click
of
rifles
being
cocked
is
heard
on
all
sides

the
children
of

the
indian
descends
to
the
third
story
of
the
temple
he
enters
a
door
and
presently
returns
bringing
with
him
five
females
dressed
in
the
navajo
costume
they
are
women
and
girls
and
as
anyone
could
tell
at
a
glance
of
the
race
but
there
are
those
present
who
know
them
still
better
three
of
them
are
recognised
by
as
many
hunters
and
recognise
them
in
turn
the
girls
rush
out
to
the
parapet
stretch
forth
their
arms
and
utter
exclamations
of
joy
the
hunters
call
to
them
pepe
rafaela
jesusita
coupling
their
names
with
expressions
of
endearment
they
shout
to

several

in

the
indians
place
the

descend
and
the

leap
into
the
arms
of
their
friends
two
of
them
remain
above
only
three
have
come
down
seguin
has
dismounted
and
passes
these
three
with
a
glance
none
of
them
is
the
object
of
his
solicitude
he
rushes
up
the
ladder
followed
by
several
of
the
men
he
springs
from
terrace
to
terrace
up
to
the
third
he
presses
forward
to
the
spot
where
stand
the
two
captive
girls
his
looks
are
wild
and
his
manner
that
of
one
frantic
they
shrink
back
at
his
approach
mistaking
his
intentions
they
scream
with
terror
he
pierces
them
with
his
look
the
instincts
of
the
father
are
busy
they
are
baffled
one
of
the
females
is

exclaims
with
a
sigh
there
was
a
mark

no

he
leans
forward
seizing
the
girl
though
not
ungently
by
the
wrist
her
sleeve
is
torn
open
and
the
arm
laid
bare
to
the
shoulder
no

again
exclaims

she
he
turns
from
them
he
rushes
forward
to
the
old
indian
who
falls

at
the
glare
of
his
fiery
eye

they
run
from

and
drag
out
the
screaming

there
are
indian
men
in
some
of
the
houses
lagging
braves

some
of

seguin
eye
is
busy
his
heart
is
yearning
at
the
arrival
of

scans
their

in

many
of
them
are
young
and
pretty
but
brown
as
the
fallen

i
did
not

of
that
come
come
we
run
together
down
the
ladders
and
approach
the
delivered
captives
seguin
hurriedly
describes
the
object
of
his
search
it
must
be
the
mystery
queen
says
one
yes
yes
cries
seguin
in
trembling
anxiety
it
is
she
is
the
mystery
queen
she
is
in
the
town
then
adds
another
where
where
ejaculates
the
father
where
where
echo
the
girls
questioning
one
another
i
saw
her
this
morning
a
short
time
ago
just
before
you
came
up
i
saw
him
hurry
her
off
adds
a
second
pointing
upward
to
the
old
indian
he
has
hidden
her
caval
cries
another
perhaps
in
the
estufa
the
estufa
what
is
it
where
the
sacred
fire
burns
where
he
makes
his
medicine
where
is
it
lead
me
to
it
ay
de
mi
we
know
not
the
way
it
is
a
sacred
place
where
they
burn
people
ay
de
mi
but
senor
it
is
in
this
temple
somewhere
under
the
ground
he
knows
none
but
he
is
permitted
to
enter
it
carrai
the
estufa
is
a
fearful
place
so
say
the
people
an
indefinite
idea
that
his
daughter
may
be
in
danger
crosses
the
mind
of
seguin
perhaps
she
is
dead
already
or
dying
by
some
horrid
means
he
is
struck
so
are
we
with
the
expression
of
sullen
malice
that
displays
itself
upon
the
countenance
of
the
medicine
chief
it
is
altogether
an
indian
expression
that
of
dogged
determination
to
die
rather
than
yield
what
he
has
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
it
is
a
look
of
demoniac
cunning
characteristic
of
men
of
his
peculiar
calling
among
the
tribes
haunted
by
this
thought
seguin
runs
to
the
ladder
and
again
springs
upward
to
the
root
followed
by
several
of
the
band
he
rushes
upon
the
lying
priest
clutching
him
by
the
long
hair
lead
me
to
her
he
cries
in
a
voice
of
thunder
lead
me
to
this
queen
this
mystery
queen
she
is
my
daughter
your
daughter
the
mystery
queen
replies
the
indian
trembling
with
fear
for
his
life
yet
still
resisting
the
appeal
no
white
man
she
is
not
the
queen
is
ours
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
sun
she
is
the
child
of
a
navajo
chief
tempt
me
no
longer
old
man
no
longer
i
say
look
forth
if
a
hair
of
her
head
has
been
harmed
all
these
shall
suffer
i
will
not
leave
a
living
thing
in
your
town
lead
on
bring
me
to
the
estufa
to
the
estufa
to
the
estufa
shout
several
voices
strong
hands
grasp
the
garments
of
the
indian
and
are
twined
into
his
loose
hair
knives
already
red
and
reeking
are
brandished
before
his
eyes
he
is
forced
from
the
roof
and
hurried
down
the
ladders
he
ceases
to
resist
for
he
sees
that
resistance
is
death
and
he
conducts
them
to
the
of
the
building
he
enters
by
a
passage
covered
with
the
shaggy
hides
of
the
buffalo
seguin
follows
keeping
his
eye
and
hand
upon
him
we
crowd
after
close
upon
the
heels
of
both
we
pass
through
dark
ways
descending
as
we
go
through
an
intricate
labyrinth
we
arrive
in
a
large
room
dimly
lighted
ghastly
images
are
before
us
and
around
us
the
mystic
symbols
of
a
horrid
religion
the
walls
are
hung
with
hideous
shapes
and
skins
of
wild
beasts
we
can
see
the
fierce
visages
of
the
grizzly
bear
of
the
white
buffalo
of
the
carcajou
of
the
panther
and
the
ravenous
wolf
we
can
recognise
the
horns
and
frontlets
of
the
elk
the
cimmaron
and
the
grim
bison
here
and
there
are
idol
figures
of
grotesque
and
monster
forms
carved
from
wood
and
the
red
claystone
of
the
desert
a
lamp
is
flickering
with
a
feeble
glare
and
on
a
brazero
near
the
centre
of
the
room
burns
a
small
bluish
flame
it
is
the
sacred
fire
the
fire
that
for
centuries
has
blazed
to
the
god
quetzalcoatl
we
do
not
stay
to
examine
these
objects
the
fumes
of
the
charcoal
almost
suffocate
us
we
run
in
every
direction
overturning
the
idols
and
dragging
down
the
sacred
skins
there
are
huge
serpents
gliding
over
the
floor
and
hissing
around
our
feet
they
have
been
disturbed
and
frightened
by
the
unwonted
intrusion
we
too
are
frightened
for
we
hear
the
dreaded
rattle
of
the
crotalus
the
men
leap
from
the
ground
and
strike
at
them
with
the
butts
of
their
rifles
they
crush
many
of
them
on
the
stone
pavement
there
are
shouts
and
confusion
we
suffer
from
the
exhalations
of
the
charcoal
we
shall
be
stifled
where
is
seguin
where
has
he
gone
hark
there
are
screams
it
is
a
female
voice
there
are
voices
of
men
too
we
rush
towards
the
spot
where
they
are
heard
we
dash
aside
the
walls
of
pendant
skins
we
see
the
chief
he
has
a
female
in
his
arms
a
girl
a
beautiful
girl
robed
in
gold
and
bright
plumes
she
is
screaming
as
we
enter
and
struggling
to
escape
him
he
holds
her
firmly
and
has
torn
open
the
sleeve
of
her
tunic
he
is
gazing
on
her
left
arm
which
is
bared
to
the
bosom
it
is
she
it
is
she
he
cries
in
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
oh
god
it
is
she
adele
adele
do
you
not
know
me
me
your
father
her
screams
continue
she
pushes
him
off
stretching
out
her
arms
to
the
indian
and
calling
upon
him
to
protect
her
the
father
entreats
her
in
wild
and
pathetic
words
she
heeds
him
not
she
turns
her
face
from
him
and
crouches
down
hugging
the
knees
of
the
priest
she
knows
me
not
oh
god
my
child
my
child
again
seguin
speaks
in
the
indian
tongue
and
with
imploring
accents
adele
adele
i
am
your
father
you
who
are
you
the
white
men
our
foes
touch
me
not
away
white
men
away
dear
dearest
adele
do
not
repel
me
me
your
father
you
remember
my
father
my
father
was
a
great
chief
he
is
dead
this
is
my
father
now
the
sun
is
my
father
i
am
a
daughter
of
montezuma
i
am
a
queen
of
the
navajoes
as
she
utters
these
words
a
change
seems
to
come
over
her
spirit
she
crouches
no
longer
she
rises
to
her
feet
her
screaming
has
ended
and
she
stands
in
an
attitude
of
pride
and
indignation
oh
adele
continues
seguin
more
earnest
than
ever
look
at
me
look
do
you
not
remember
look
in
my
face
oh
heaven
here
see
here
is
your
mother
adele
see
this
is
her
picture
your
angel
mother
look
at
it
look
oh
adele
seguin
while
he
is
speaking
draws
a
miniature
from
his
bosom
and
holds
it
before
the
eyes
of
the
girl
it
arrests
her
attention
she
looks
upon
it
but
without
any
signs
of
recognition
it
is
to
her
only
a
curious
object
she
seems
struck
with
his
manner
frantic
but
intreating
she
seems
to
regard
him
with
wonder
still
she
repels
him
it
is
evident
she
knows
him
not
she
has
lost
every
recollection
of
him
and
his
she
has
forgotten
the
language
of
her
childhood
she
has
forgotten
her
father
her
mother
she
has
forgotten
all
i
could
not
restrain
my
tears
as
i
looked
upon
the
face
of
my
friend
for
i
had
grown
to
consider
him
such
like
one
who
has
received
a
mortal
wound
yet
still
lives
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
group
silent
and
crushed
his
head
had
fallen
upon
his
breast
his
cheek
was
blanched
and
bloodless
and
his
eye
wandered
with
an
expression
of
imbecility
painful
to
behold
i
could
imagine
the
terrible
conflict
that
was
raging
within
he
made
no
further
efforts
to
intreat
the
girl
he
no
longer
offered
to
approach
her
but
stood
for
some
moments
in
the
same
attitude
without
speaking
a
word
bring
her
away
he
muttered
at
length
in
a
voice
husky
and
broken
bring
her
away
perhaps
in
god
mercy
she
may
yet
remember
chapter
thirty
nine
the
white
scalp
we
repassed
the
horrid
chamber
and
emerged
upon
the
lowermost
terrace
of
the
temple
as
i
walked
forward
to
the
parapet
there
was
a
scene
below
that
filled
me
with
apprehension
a
cloud
seemed
to
fall
over
my
heart
in
front
of
the
temple
were
the
women
of
the
village
girls
women
and
children
in
all
about
two
hundred
they
were
variously
attired
some
were
wrapped
in
their
striped
blankets
some
wore
tilmas
and
tunics
of
embroidered
plumed
and
painted
with
dyes
of
vivid
colour
some
were
dressed
in
the
garb
of
civilised
life
in
rich
satins
that
had
been
worn
by
the
dames
of
the
del
norte
in
flounces
that
had
fluttered
in
the
dance
around
the
ankles
of
some
gay
maja
not
a
few
in
the
crowd
were
entirely
nude
they
were
all
indians
but
of
lighter
and
darker
shades
differing
in
colour
as
in
expression
of
face
some
were
old
wrinkled
and
coarse
but
there
were
many
of
them
young
and
altogether
beautiful
they
were
grouped
together
in
various
attitudes
they
had
ceased
their
screaming
but
murmured
among
themselves
in
low
and
plaintive
exclamations
as
i
looked
i
saw
blood
running
from
their
ears
it
had
dappled
their
throats
and
spurted
over
their
garments
a
glance
satisfied
me
as
to
the
cause
of
this
they
had
been
rudely
robbed
of
their
golden
hangings
near
and
around
them
stood
the
in
groups
and
afoot
they
were
talking
in
whispers
and
low
mutterings
there
were
objects
about
their
persons
that
attracted
my
eye
curious
articles
of
ornament
or
use
peeped
out
from
their
pouches
and
haversacks
and
pieces
of
shining
metal
gold
it
was
hung
around
their
necks
and
over
their
breasts
these
were
the
plundered
bijouterie
of
the
savage
maidens
there
were
other
objects
upon
which
my
eye
rested
with
feelings
of
deeper
pain
stuck
behind
the
belts
of
many
were
scalps
fresh
and
reeking
their
and
fingers
were
red
there
was
blood
upon
their
hands
there
was
gloom
in
their
glances
the
picture
was
appalling
and
adding
to
its
awful
impression
black
clouds
were
at
the
moment
rolling
over
the
valley
and
swathing
the
mountains
in
their
opaque
masses
the
lightning
jetted
from
peak
to
peak
followed
by
short
claps
of
close
and
deafening
thunder
bring
up
the
atajo
shouted
seguin
as
he
descended
the
ladder
with
his
daughter
a
signal
was
given
and
shortly
after
the
mules
in
charge
of
the
arrieros
came
stringing
across
the
plain
collect
all
the
dry
meat
that
can
be
found
let
it
be
packed
as
speedily
as
possible
in
front
of
most
of
the
houses
there
were
strings
of
tasajo
hanging
against
the
walls
there
were
also
dried
fruits
and
vegetables
chile
roots
of
the
kamas
and
filled
with
pinons
and
the
meat
was
soon
brought
together
and
several
of
the
men
assisted
the
arrieros
in
packing
it
there
will
be
barely
enough
said
seguin
here
rube
continued
he
calling
to
the
old
trapper

be
as
many
as
we
can
take
you
know
them
chose
those
most
likely
to
tempt
an
exchange
so
saying
the
chief
turned
off
towards
the
atajo
leading
his
daughter
with
the
intention
of
mounting
her
on
one
of
the
mules
rube
proceeded
to
obey
the
orders
given
him
in
a
short
time
he
had
collected
a
number
of
unresisting
captives
and
had
put
them
aside
from
the
rest
they
were
principally
girls
and
young
lads
whose
dress
and
features
bespoke
them
of
the
noblesse
of
the
nation
the
children
of
chiefs
and
warriors
this
movement
was
not
regarded
in
silence
the
men
had
drawn
together
and
commenced
talking
in
loud
and
mutinous
language
wagh
exclaimed
kirker
a
fellow
of
brutal
aspect

that

palaver

runs

drop
the
weemen
and
take
what
o
handiest
to

was
said
with
a
significant
gesture
and
a
ferocity
of
expression
revolting
to
behold
now
boys

say

i
freeze
to
kirker
and

and
i

yer
saying
this
he
seized
one
of
the
indians
a
large
woman
roughly
by
the
wrist
and
commenced
dragging
her
towards
the
atajo
the
woman
screamed
and
resisted
frightened
not
at
what
had
been
said
for
she
did
not
understand
it
but
terrified
by
the
ruffian
expression
that
was
plainly
legible
in
the
countenance
of
the
man
shut
up
yer
will

cried
he
still
pulling
her
towards
the
mules
i
not
goin
to

wagh

and
with
this
exclamation
he
lifted
the
woman
upon
one
of
the
mules
if
ye
do
sit
still
i
tie
ye
mind
that
and
he
held
up
the
lasso
making
signs
of
his
determination
a
horrid
scene
now
ensued
a
number
of
the
followed
the
example
of
their
ruffian
comrade
each
one
chose
the
girl
or
woman
he
had
fancied
and
commenced
hurrying
her
off
to
the
atajo
the
women
shrieked
the
men
shouted
and
swore
several
scrambled
for
the
same
prize
a
girl
more
beautiful
than
her
companions
a
quarrel
was
the
consequence
oaths
and
ejaculations
rang
out
knives
were
drawn
and
pistols
cocked
toss
up
for
her
cried
one
ay
that
fair
toss
up
toss
up
shouted
several
the
hint
was
adopted
the
lots
were
cast
and
the
savage
belle
became
the
property
of
the
winner
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
nearly
every
mule
in
the
atajo
carried
an
indian
damsel
some
of
the
hunters
had
taken
no
part
in
this
sabine
proceeding
some
disapproved
of
it
for
all
were
not
bad
from
motives
of
humanity
others
did
not
care
for
being
hampered
with
a
squaw
but
stood
apart
savagely
laughing
at
the
scene
during
all
this
time
seguin
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
with
his
daughter
he
had
mounted
her
upon
one
of
the
mules
and
covered
her
shoulders
with
his
serape
he
was
making
such
preparations
for
her
journey
as
the
tender
solicitudes
of
the
father
suggested
the
noise
at
length
attracted
him
and
leaving
her
in
charge
of
his
servants
he
hurried
round
to
the
front
comrades
cried
he
glancing
at
the
mounted
captives
and
comprehending
all
that
had
occurred
there
are
too
many
here
are
these
whom
you
have
chosen
this
question
was
directed
to
the
trapper
rube
no
replied
the
latter
them
and
he
pointed
to
the
party
he
had
picked
out
dismount
these
then
and
place
those
you
have
selected
upon
the
mules
we
have
a
desert
to
cross
and
it
will
be
as
much
as
we
can
do
to
pass
it
with
that
number
and
without
appearing
to
notice
the
scowling
looks
of
his
followers
he
proceeded
in
company
with
rube
and
several
others
to
execute
the
command
he
had
given
the
indignation
of
the
hunters
now
showed
itself
in
open
mutiny
fierce
looks
were
exchanged
and
threats
uttered
aloud
by
heaven
cried
one
i
have
my
gal
along
or
her
scalp
vaya
exclaimed
another
in
spanish
why
take
any
of
them
not
worth
the
trouble
after
all
there
not
one
of
them
worth
the
price
of
her
own
hair
take
the
har
then
and
leave
the
niggurs
suggested
a
third
i
say
so
too
and
i
i
vote
with
you
hoss
comrades
said
seguin
turning
to
the
mutineers
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
extreme
mildness
remember
your
promise
count
the
prisoners
as
we
agreed
i
will
answer
for
the
payment
of
all
can
ye
pay
for
them
now
asked
a
voice
you
know
that
that
would
be
impossible
pay
for
them
now
pay
for
them
now
shouted
several
cash
or
scalps
says
i
carrajo
where
is
the
captain
to
get
the
money
when
we
reach
el
paso
more
than
here
he
neither
a
jew
nor
a
banker
and
it
news
to
me
if
he
grown
so
rich
where
then
is
all
the
money
to
some
from
not
from
the
cabildo
unless
the
scalps
are
forthcoming
i
warrant
that
true
jose
they
give
no
money
to
him
more
than
to
us
and
we
can
get
it
ourselves
if
we
show
the
skins
for
it
that
we
can
wagh
what
cares
he
for
us
now
that
he
has
got
what
he
wanted
not
a
niggur
scalp
he
would
let
us
go
by
the
prieto
when
we
kud
gathered
the
shining
stuff
in
chunks
now
he
wants
us
to
throw
away
this
chance
too
we
be
green
fools
to
do
it
i
say
it
struck
me
at
this
moment
that
i
might
interfere
with
success
money
seemed
to
be
what
the
mutineers
wanted
at
least
it
was
their
alleged
grievance
and
rather
than
witness
the
fearful
drama
which
appeared
to
be
on
the
eve
of
enactment
i
would
have
sacrificed
my
fortune
men
cried
i
speaking
so
that
i
could
be
heard
above
the
din
if
you
deem
my
word
worth
listening
to
it
is
this
i
have
sent
a
cargo
to
chihuahua
with
the
last
caravan
by
the
time
we
get
back
to
el
paso
the
traders
will
have
returned
and
i
shall
be
placed
in
possession
of
funds
double
what
you
demand
if
you
will
accept
my
promise
i
shall
see
that
you
be
paid
wagh
that
talk
all
very
well
but
what
do
we
know
of
you
or
yer
cargo
vaya
a
bird
in
the
hand
worth
two
in
the
bush
he
a
trader
who
goin
to
take
his
word
rot
his
cargo
scalps
or
cash
cash
or
scalps
that
this
advice
an
if
ye
do
take
it
boys
ye
may
leave
it
but
it
all
the
pay
ye
ever
crook
yer
claws
on
the
men
had
tasted
blood
and
like
the
tiger
they
thirsted
for
more
there
were
glaring
eyes
on
all
sides
and
the
countenances
of
some
exhibited
an
animal
ferociousness
hideous
to
look
upon
the
discipline
that
hitherto
ruled
in
the
band
seemed
to
have
completely
departed
and
the
authority
of
the
chief
to
be
set
at
defiance
on
the
other
side
stood
the
females
clinging
and
huddling
together
they
could
not
understand
the
mutinous
language
but
they
saw
threatening
attitudes
and
angry
faces
they
saw
knives
drawn
and
heard
the
cocking
of
guns
and
pistols
they
knew
there
was
danger
and
they
crouched
together
whimpering
with
fear
up
to
this
moment
seguin
had
stood
giving
directions
for
the
mounting
of
his
captives
his
manner
was
strangely
abstracted
as
it
had
been
ever
since
the
scene
of
meeting
with
his
daughter
that
greater
care
gnawing
at
his
heart
seemed
to
render
him
insensible
to
what
was
passing
he
was
not
so
as
kirker
ended
for
he
was
the
last
speaker
a
change
came
over
sequin
manner
quick
as
a
flash
of
lightning
suddenly
rousing
himself
from
his
attitude
of
indifference
he
stepped
forward
in
front
of
the
mutineers
dare
shouted
he
in
a
voice
of
thunder
dare
to
dishonour
your
oaths
by
heavens
the
first
man
who
raises
knife
or
rifle
shall
die
on
the
instant
there
was
a
pause
and
a
moment
of
deep
silence
i
had
made
a
vow
continued
he
that
should
it
please
god
to
restore
me
my
child
this
hand
should
be
stained
with
no
more
blood
let
any
man
force
me
to
break
that
vow
and
by
heaven
his
blood
shall
be
the
first
to
stain
it
a
vengeful
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
but
no
one
replied
you
are
but
a
cowardly
brute
with
all
your
bluster
he
continued
turning
round
to
kirker
and
looking
him
in
the
eye
up
with
that
knife
quick
or
i
will
send
this
bullet
through
your
ruffian
heart
seguin
had
drawn
his
pistol
and
stood
in
an
attitude
that
told
he
would
execute
the
threat
his
form
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
his
eye
dilated
flashing
as
it
rolled
and
the
man
shrank
before
its
glance
he
saw
death
in
it
if
he
disobeyed
and
with
a
surly
murmur
he
fumbled
mechanically
at
his
belt
and
thrust
the
blade
back
into
its
sheath
but
the
mutiny
was
not
yet
quelled
these
were
men
not
so
easily
conquered
fierce
exclamations
still
continued
and
the
mutineers
again
began
to
encourage
one
another
with
shouts
i
had
thrown
myself
alongside
the
chief
with
my
revolvers
cocked
and
ready
resolved
to
stand
by
him
to
the
death
several
others
had
done
the
same
among
whom
were
rube
garey
sanchez
the
and
the
maricopa
the
opposing
parties
were
nearly
equal
and
a
fearful
conflict
would
have
followed
had
we
fought
but
at
this
moment
an
object
appeared
that
stifled
the
resentment
of
all
it
was
the
common
enemy
away
on
the
western
border
of
the
valley
we
could
see
dark
objects
hundreds
of
them
coming
over
the
plain
they
were
still
at
a
great
distance
but
the
practised
eyes
of
the
hunters
knew
them
at
a
glance
they
were
horsemen
they
were
indians
they
were
our
pursuers
the
navajoes
they
were
riding
at
full
gallop
and
strung
over
the
prairie
like
hounds
upon
a
run
in
a
twinkling
they
would
be
on
us
yonder
cried
seguin
yonder
are
scalps
enough
to
satisfy
you
but
let
us
see
to
our
own
come
to
your
horses
on
with
the
atajo
i
will
keep
my
word
with
you
at
the
pass
mount
my
brave
fellows
mount
the
last
speech
was
uttered
in
a
tone
of
reconciliation
but
it
needed
not
that
to
quicken
the
movements
of
the
hunters
they
knew
too
well
their
own
danger
they
could
have
sustained
the
attack
among
the
houses
but
it
would
only
have
been
until
the
return
of
the
main
tribe
when
they
knew
that
every
life
would
be
taken
to
make
a
stand
at
the
town
would
be
madness
and
was
not
thought
of
in
a
moment
we
were
in
our
saddles
and
the
atajo
strung
out
with
the
captives
and
provisions
was
hurrying
off
toward
the
woods
we
purposed
passing
the
defile
that
opened
eastward
as
our
retreat
by
the
other
route
was
now
cut
off
by
the
advancing
horsemen
seguin
had
thrown
himself
at
the
head
leading
the
mule
upon
which
his
daughter
was
mounted
the
rest
followed
straggling
over
the
plain
without
rank
or
order
i
was
among
the
last
to
leave
the
town
i
had
lingered
behind
purposely
fearing
some
outrage
and
determined
if
possible
to
prevent
it
at
length
thought
i
they
have
all
gone
and
putting
spurs
to
my
horse
i
galloped
after
when
i
had
ridden
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
walls
a
loud
yell
rang
behind
me
and
reining
in
my
horse
i
turned
in
the
saddle
and
looked
back
another
yell
wild
and
savage
directed
me
to
the
point
whence
the
former
had
come
on
the
highest
roof
of
the
temple
two
men
were
struggling
i
knew
them
at
a
glance
and
i
knew
too
it
was
a
one
was
the
medicine
chief
as
i
could
tell
by
the
flowing
white
hair
the
scanty
skirt
and
leggings
the
naked
ankles
the
enabled
me
easily
to
distinguish
his
antagonist
it
was
the
earless
trapper
the
conflict
was
a
short
one
i
had
not
seen
the
beginning
of
it
but
i
soon
witnessed
the
denouement
as
i
turned
the
trapper
had
forced
his
adversary
against
the
parapet
and
with
his
long
muscular
arm
was
bending
him
over
its
edge
in
the
other
hand
uplifted
he
brandished
his
knife
i
saw
a
quick
flash
as
the
blade
was
plunged
a
red
gush
spurted
over
the
garments
of
the
indian
his
arms
dropped
his
body
doubled
over
the
wall
balanced
a
moment
and
then
fell
with
a
dull
sodden
sound
upon
the
terrace
below
the
same
wild
whoop
again
rang
in
my
ears
and
the
hunter
disappeared
from
the
root
i
turned
to
ride
on
i
knew
it
was
the
settling
of
some
old
account
the
winding
up
of
some
terrible
revenge
the
clattering
of
hoofs
sounded
behind
me
and
a
horseman
rode
up
alongside
i
knew
without
turning
my
head
that
it
was
the
trapper
fair
swop
they
say
ai
no
stealin
putty
har
too
it
ur
wagh
it
wo
neyther
match
nor
patch
mine
but
it
makes
one
easier
puzzled
at
this
speech
i
turned
to
ascertain
its
meaning
i
was
answered
by
the
sight
that
met
my
eye
an
object
was
hanging
from
the
old
man
belt
like
a
streak
of
flax
but
it
was
not
that
it
was
hair
it
was
a
scalp
there
were
drops
of
blood
struggling
down
the
silvery
strands
as
they
shook
and
across
them
near
the
middle
was
a
broad
red
band
it
was
the
track
of
the
trapper
knife
where
he
had
wiped
it
chapter
forty
the
fight
in
the
pass
we
entered
the
woods
and
followed
the
indian
trail
up
stream
we
hurried
forward
as
fast
as
the
atajo
could
be
driven
a
scramble
of
five
miles
brought
us
to
the
eastern
end
of
the
valley
here
the
sierras
impinged
upon
the
river
forming
a
canon
it
was
a
grim
gap
similar
to
that
we
had
passed
on
entering
from
the
west
but
still
more
fearful
in
its
features
unlike
the
former
there
was
no
road
over
the
mountains
on
either
side
the
valley
was
headed
in
by
precipitous
cliffs
and
the
trail
lay
through
the
canon
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
the
latter
was
shallow
during
freshets
it
became
a
torrent
and
then
the
valley
was
inaccessible
from
the
east
but
that
was
a
rare
occurrence
in
these
rainless
regions
we
entered
the
canon
without
halting
and
galloped
over
the
detritus
and
round
huge
boulders
that
lay
in
its
bed
far
above
us
rose
the
frowning
cliffs
thousands
of
feet
overhead
great
rocks
scarped
out
abutting
over
the
stream
shaggy
pines
hung
top
downward
clinging
in
their
seams
shapeless
bunches
of
cacti
and
mezcals
crawled
along
the
cliffs
their
picturesque
but
gloomy
foliage
adding
to
the
wildness
of
the
scene
it
was
dark
within
the
pass
from
the
shadow
of
the
jutting
masses
but
now
darker
than
usual
for
black
were
swathing
the
cliffs
overhead
through
these
at
short
intervals
the
lightning
forked
and
flashed
glancing
in
the
water
at
our
feet
the
thunder
in
quick
sharp
percussions
broke
over
the
ravine
but
as
yet
it
rained
not
we
plunged
hurriedly
through
the
shallow
stream
following
the
guide
there
were
places
not
without
danger
where
the
water
swept
around
angles
of
the
cliff
with
an
impetuosity
that
almost
lifted
our
horses
from
their
feet
but
we
had
no
choice
and
we
scrambled
on
urging
our
animals
with
voice
and
spur
after
riding
for
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
we
reached
the
head
of
the
canon
and
climbed
out
on
the
bank
now
cried
the
guide
reining
up
and
pointing
to
the
entrance

place

make

kin
keep
them

is
that
mountain
near
the
line
of
our
course
think
you
as
seguin
spoke
he
pointed
to
a
peak
that
towered
over
the
plain
far
off
to
the
eastward
the
trail
we
oughter
take
for
the
ole
mine
passes
clost
by
it
to
the
o
yon

thur
a

i
got
clur
myself
very
well
the
party
can
take
the
mountain
for
their
guide
i
will
despatch
them
at
once
about
twenty
men
who
rode
the
poorest
horses
were
selected
from
the
band
these
guarding
the
atajo
and
captives
immediately
set
out
and
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
snowy
mountain
el
sol
went
with
this
party
in
charge
of
dacoma
and
the
daughter
of
our
chief
the
rest
of
us
prepared
to
defend
the
pass
our
horses
were
tied
in
a
defile
and
we
took
our
stands
where
we
could
command
the
embouchure
of
the
canon
with
our
rifles
we
waited
in
silence
for
the
approaching
foe
as
yet
no
had
reached
us
but
we
knew
that
our
pursuers
could
not
be
far
off
and
we
knelt
behind
the
rocks
straining
our
eyes
down
the
dark
ravine
it
is
difficult
to
give
an
idea
of
our
position
by
the
pen
the
ground
we
had
selected
as
the
point
of
defence
was
unique
in
its
formation
and
not
easily
described
yet
it
is
necessary
you
should
know
something
of
its
peculiar
character
in
order
to
comprehend
what
followed
the
stream
after
meandering
over
a
shallow
shingly
channel
entered
the
canon
through
a
vast
gap
between
two
giant
portals
one
of
these
was
the
abrupt
ending
of
the
granite
ridge
the
other
a
detached
mass
of
stratified
rock
below
this
gate
the
channel
widened
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
where
its
bed
was
covered
with
loose
boulders
and
logs
of
drift
timber
still
farther
down
the
cliffs
approached
each
other
so
near
that
only
two
horsemen
could
ride
between
them
abreast
and
beyond
this
the
channel
again
widened
and
the
bed
of
the
stream
was
filled
with
rocks
huge
fragments
that
had
fallen
from
the
mountain
the
place
we
occupied
was
among
the
rocks
and
drift
within
the
canon
and
below
the
great
gap
which
formed
its
mouth
we
had
chosen
the
position
from
necessity
at
at
this
point
the
bank
shelved
out
and
offered
a
way
to
the
open
country
by
which
our
pursuers
could
outflank
us
should
we
allow
them
to
get
so
far
up
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
prevent
this
and
we
placed
ourselves
to
defend
the
lower
or
second
narrowing
of
the
channel
we
knew
that
below
that
point
beetling
cliffs
walled
in
the
stream
on
both
sides
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
ascend
out
of
its
bed
if
we
could
restrain
them
from
making
a
rush
at
the
shelving
bank
we
would
have
them
penned
up
from
any
farther
advance
they
could
only
flank
our
position
by
returning
to
the
valley
and
going
about
by
the
western
end
a
distance
of
fifty
miles
at
the
least
at
all
events
we
should
hold
them
in
check
until
the
atajo
had
got
a
long
start
and
then
trusting
to
our
horses
we
intended
to
follow
it
in
the
night
we
knew
that
in
the
end
we
should
have
to
abandon
the
defence
as
the
want
of
provisions
would
not
allow
us
to
hold
out
for
any
length
of
time
at
the
command
of
our
leader
we
had
thrown
ourselves
among
the
rocks
the
thunder
was
now
pealing
over
our
heads
and
reverberating
through
the
canon
black
clouds
rolled
along
the
cliffs
split
and
torn
by
brilliant
jets
big
drops
still
falling
thinly
slapped
down
upon
the
stones
as
seguin
had
told
me
rain
thunder
and
lightning
are
rare
phenomena
in
these
regions
but
when
they
do
occur
it
is
with
that
violence
which
characterises
the
storms
of
the
tropics
the
elements
escaping
from
their
wonted
continence
rage
in
fiercer
war
the
electricity
suddenly
displaced
from
its
equilibrium
seems
to
revel
in
havoc
rending
asunder
the
harmonies
of
nature
the
eye
of
the
geognosist
in
scanning
the
features
of
this
plateau
land
could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
character
of
its
atmosphere
the
dread
canons
the
deep
barrancas
the
broken
banks
of
streams
and
the
channels
of
the
arroyos
all
testified
that
we
were
in
a
land
of
sudden
floods
away
to
the
east
towards
the
head
waters
of
the
river
we
could
see
that
the
storm
was
raging
in
its
full
fury
the
mountains
in
that
direction
were
no
longer
visible
thick
were
descending
upon
them
and
we
could
hear
the
sough
of
the
falling
water
we
knew
that
it
would
soon
be
upon
us
what
keepin
them
anyhow
inquired
a
voice
our
pursuers
had
time
to
have
been
up
the
delay
was
unexpected
the
lord

another

crick
that
wud
care

wade
it
hooray
it
ur
sure
enuf
hooray
as
the
trapper
uttered
these
exclamations
a
vast
black
cloud
came
rolling
down
from
the
east
until
its
giant
winds
canopied
the
defile
it
was
filled
with
rumbling
thunder
breaking
at
intervals
into
louder
percussions
as
the
red
bolts
passed
hissing
through
it
from
this
cloud
the
rain
fell
not
in
drops
but
as
the
hunter
had
predicted
in
spouts
the
men
hastily
throwing
the
skirts
of
their
hunting
shirts
over
their
remained
silent
under
the
pelting
of
the
storm
another
sound
heard
between
the
peals
now
called
our
attention
it
resembled
the
continuous
noise
of
a
train
of
waggons
passing
along
a
gravelly
road
it
was
the
sound
of
on
the
shingly
bed
of
the
canon
it
was
the
of
the
approaching
navajoes
suddenly
it
ceased
they
had
halted
for
what
purpose
perhaps
to
reconnoitre
this
conjecture
proved
to
be
correct
for
in
a
few
moments
a
small
red
object
appeared
over
a
distant
rock
it
was
the
forehead
of
an
indian
with
its
vermilion
paint
it
was
too
distant
for
the
range
of
a
rifle
and
the
hunters
watched
it
without
moving
soon
another
appeared
and
another
and
then
a
number
of
dark
forms
were
seen
lurking
from
rock
to
rock
as
they
advanced
up
the
canon
our
pursuers
had
dismounted
and
were
approaching
us
on
foot
our
faces
were
concealed
by
the
wrack
that
covered
the
stones
and
the
indians
had
not
yet
discovered
us
they
were
evidently
in
doubt
as
to
whether
we
had
gone
on
and
this
was
their
vanguard
making
the
necessary
reconnaissance
in
a
short
time
the
foremost
by
starts
and
runs
had
got
close
up
to
the
narrow
part
of
the
canon
there
was
a
boulder
below
this
point
and
the
upper
part
of
the
indian
head
showed
itself
for
an
instant
over
the
rock
at
the
same
instant
half
a
dozen
rifles
cracked
the
head
disappeared
and
the
moment
after
an
object
was
seen
down
upon
the
pebbles
at
the
base
of
the
boulder
it
was
the
brown
arm
of
the
savage
lying
palm
upward
we
knew
that
the
leaden
messengers
had
done
their
work
the
pursuers
though
at
the
expense
of
one
of
their
number
had
now
ascertained
the
fact
of
our
presence
as
well
as
our
position
and
the
advanced
party
were
seen
retreating
as
they
had
approached
the
men
who
had
fired
reloaded
their
pieces
and
kneeling
down
as
before
watched
with
sharp
eyes
and
cocked
rifles
it
was
a
long
time
before
we
heard
anything
more
of
the
enemy
but
we
knew
that
they
were
deliberating
on
some
plan
of
attack
there
was
but
one
way
by
which
they
could
defeat
us
by
charging
up
the
canon
and
fighting
us
by
an
attack
of
this
kind
their
main
loss
would
be
in
the
first
volley
they
might
ride
upon
us
before
we
could
reload
and
far
outnumbering
us
would
soon
decide
the
day
with
their
long
lances
we
knew
all
this
but
we
knew
too
that
a
first
volley
when
well
delivered
invariably
staggers
an
indian
charge
and
we
relied
on
such
a
hope
for
our
safety
we
had
arranged
to
fire
by
platoons
and
thus
have
the
advantage
of
a
second
discharge
should
the
indians
not
retreat
at
the
first
for
nearly
an
hour
the
hunters
crouched
under
the
drenching
rain
looking
only
to
keep
dry
the
locks
of
their
pieces
the
water
in
muddy
rivulets
began
to
trickle
through
the
shingle
and
eddying
around
the
rocks
covered
the
wide
channel
in
which
we
now
stood
both
above
and
below
us
the
stream
gathered
up
by
the
narrowing
of
the
channel
was
running
with
considerable
velocity
the
sun
had
set
at
least
it
seemed
so
in
the
dismal
ravine
where
we
were
we
were
growing
impatient
for
the
appearance
of
our
enemy
perhaps
they
have
gone
round
suggested
one
no
thar
till
night
they
try
it
then
let
wait
then
muttered
rube
ef
thur
green
enuf
a
half
an
hour
more

or
this
child
do
understan
weather
signs
hist
hist
cried
several
voices
together
see
they
are
coming
all
eyes
were
bent
down
the
pass
a
crowd
of
dark
objects
appeared
in
the
distance
filling
up
the
bed
of
the
stream
they
were
the
indians
and
on
horseback
we
knew
from
this
that
they
were
about
to
make
a
dash
their
movements
too
confirmed
it
they
had
formed
two
deep
and
held
their
bows
ready
to
deliver
a
flight
of
arrows
as
they
galloped
up
look
out
boyees
cried
rube
thur
now
in
airnest
look
to
yur
sights
and
give
gos
do
hear
as
the
trapper
spoke
two
hundred
voices
broke
into
a
simultaneous
yell
it
was
the
of
the
navajoes
as
its
vengeful
notes
rang
upon
the
canon
they
were
answered
by
loud
cheers
from
the
hunters
mingled
with
the
wild
whoops
of
their
delaware
and
shawano
allies
the
indians
halted
for
a
moment
beyond
the
narrowing
of
the
canon
until
those
who
were
rearmost
should
close
up
then
uttering
another
cry
they
dashed
forward
into
the
gap
so
sudden
was
their
charge
that
several
of
them
had
got
fairly
through
before
a
shot
was
fired
then
came
the
reports
of
the
guns
the
crack
crack
crack
of
rifles
the
louder
detonations
of
the
spanish
pieces
mingled
with
the
whizzing
sound
of
indian
arrows
shouts
of
encouragement
and
defiance
were
given
on
both
sides
and
groans
were
heard
as
the
grooved
bullet
or
the
poisoned
barb
tore
up
the
yielding
flesh
several
of
the
indians
had
fallen
at
the
first
volley
a
number
had
ridden
forward
to
the
spot
of
our
ambush
and
fired
their
arrows
in
our
faces
but
our
rifles
had
not
all
been
emptied
and
these
daring
savages
were
seen
to
drop
from
their
saddles
at
the
straggling
and
successive
reports
the
main
body
wheeled
behind
the
rocks
and
were
now
forming
for
a
second
charge
this
was
the
moment
of
danger
our
guns
were
idle
and
we
could
not
prevent
them
from
passing
the
gap
and
getting
through
to
the
open
country
i
saw
seguin
draw
his
pistol
and
rush
forward
calling
upon
those
who
were
similarly
armed
to
follow
his
example
we
ran
after
our
leader
down
to
the
very
jaws
of
the
canon
and
stood
waiting
the
charge
it
was
soon
to
come
for
the
enemy
exasperated
by
many
circumstances
were
determined
on
our
destruction
cost
what
it
might
again
we
heard
their
fierce
and
amidst
its
wild
echoes
the
savages
came
galloping
into
the
gap
now
yur
time
cried
a
voice
fire
hooray
the
cracks
of
fifty
pistols
were
almost
simultaneous
the
foremost
horses
reared
up
and
fell
back
kicking
and
sprawling
in
the
gap
they
fell
as
it
were
in
a
body
completely
choking
up
the
channel
those
who
came
on
behind
urged
their
animals
forward
some
stumbled
on
the
heap
of
fallen
bodies
their
horses
rose
and
fell
again
trampling
both
dead
and
living
among
their
feet
some
struggled
over
and
fought
us
with
their
lances
we
struck
back
with
our
clubbed
guns
and
closed
upon
them
with
our
knives
and
tomahawks
the
stream
rose
and
foamed
against
the
rocks
pent
back
by
the
prostrate
animals
we
fought
in
the
gathering
flood
the
thunder
roared
overhead
and
the
lightning
flashed
in
our
faces
as
though
the
elements
took
part
in
the
conflict
the
yelling
continued
wild
and
vengeful
as
ever
the
hunters
answered
it
with
fierce
shouts
oaths
flew
from
foaming
lips
and
men
grappled
in
the
embrace
that
ended
only
in
death
and
now
the
water
gathered
into
a
deep
dam
lifted
the
bodies
of
the
animals
that
had
hitherto
obstructed
it
and
swept
them
out
of
the
gap
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
would
be
upon
us
good
heavens
they
are
crowding
up
and
our
guns
are
empty
at
this
moment
a
new
sound
echoed
in
our
ears
it
was
not
the
shouts
of
men
nor
the
detonation
of
guns
nor
the
pealing
of
the
thunder
it
was
the
hoarse
roaring
of
the
torrent
a
warning
cry
was
heard
behind
us
a
voice
called
out
run
for
your
lives
to
the
bank
to
the
bank
i
turned
and
beheld
my
companions
rushing
for
the
slope
uttering
words
of
terror
and
caution
at
the
same
instant
my
eye
became
fixed
upon
an
approaching
object
not
twenty
yards
above
where
i
stood
and
just
entering
the
canon
came
a
brown
and
foaming
mass
it
was
water
bearing
on
its
crested
front
huge
logs
of
drift
and
the
torn
branches
of
trees
it
seemed
as
though
the
sluice
of
some
great
dam
had
been
suddenly
carried
away
and
this
was
the
first
gush
of
the
escaping
flood
as
i
looked
it
struck
the
portals
of
the
canon
with
a
concussion
like
thunder
and
then
rearing
back
piled
up
to
a
height
of
twenty
feet
the
next
moment
it
came
surging
through
the
gap
i
heard
their
terrified
cry
as
the
indians
wheeled
their
horses
and
fled
i
ran
for
the
bank
followed
by
my
companions
i
was
impeded
by
the
water
which
already
reached
to
my
thighs
but
with
desperate
energy
i
plunged
and
weltered
through
it
till
i
had
gained
a
point
of
safety
i
had
hardly
climbed
out
when
the
torrent
rolled
past
with
a
hissing
seething
sound
i
stood
to
observe
it
from
where
i
was
i
could
see
down
the
ravine
for
a
long
reach
the
indians
were
already
in
full
gallop
and
i
saw
the
tails
of
their
hindmost
horses
just
disappearing
round
the
rocks
the
bodies
of
the
dead
and
wounded
were
still
lying
in
the
channel
there
were
hunters
as
well
as
indians
the
wounded
screamed
as
they
saw
the
coming
flood
those
who
had
been
our
comrades
called
to
us
for
help
we
could
do
nothing
to
save
them
their
cries
had
hardly
reached
us
when
they
were
lifted
upon
the
crest
of
the
whirling
current
like
so
many
feathers
and
carried
off
with
the
velocity
of
projectiles
thar
three
good
fellows
gone
under
wagh
who
are
they
asked
seguin
and
the
men
turned
round
with
inquiring
looks
thar
one
delaware
and
big
jim
harris
and
who
is
the
third
man
that
missing
can
anyone
tell
i
think
captain
it
kirker
it
is
kirker
by
the
i
seed
him
down
wagh
they
lift
his
har
to
a
sartinty
ay
they
fish
him
out
below
that
a
sure
case
they
fish
out
a
good
haul
o
thur

i
reckin
it
be
a
tight
race
anyhow
i
heern
o
a
horse
runnin
agin
a
thunder
shower
but
them
niggurs
make
good
time
if
thur
tails

wet
afore
they
git
eend
they
will
as
the
trapper
spoke
the
floating
and
still
struggling
bodies
of
his
comrades
were
carried
to
a
bend
in
the
canon
and
whirled
out
of
sight
the
channel
was
now
filled
with
the
foaming
yellow
flood
that
frothed
against
the
rocks
as
it
forged
onward
our
danger
was
over
for
the
time
the
canon
had
become
impassable
and
after
gazing
for
a
while
upon
the
torrent
most
of
us
with
feelings
of
awe
we
turned
away
and
walked
toward
the
spot
where
we
had
left
our
horses
chapter
forty
one
the
barranca
we
staked
our
horses
upon
the
open
plain
and
returning
to
the
thicket
cut
down
wood
and
kindled
fires
we
felt
secure
our
pursuers
even
had
they
escaped
back
to
the
valley
could
not
now
reach
us
except
by
turning
the
mountains
or
waiting
for
the
falling
of
the
flood
we
knew
that
that
would
be
as
sudden
as
its
rise
should
the
rain
cease
but
the
storm
still
raged
with
unabated
fury
we
could
soon
overtake
the
atajo
but
we
determined
to
remain
for
some
time
at
the
canon
until
men
and
horses
had
refreshed
themselves
by
eating
both
were
in
need
of
food
as
the
hurried
events
of
the
preceding
days
had
given
no
opportunity
for
a
regular
bivouac
the
fires
were
soon
blazing
under
shelter
of
the
overhanging
rocks
and
the
dried
meat
was
broiled
for
our
suppers
and
eaten
with
sufficient
relish
supper
ended
we
sat
with
smoking
garments
around
the
red
embers
several
of
the
men
had
received
wounds
these
were
rudely
dressed
by
their
comrades
the
doctor
having
gone
forward
with
the
atajo
we
remained
for
several
hours
by
the
canon
the
tempest
still
played
around
us
and
the
water
rose
higher
and
higher
this
was
exactly
what
we
wished
for
and
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
flood
increase
to
such
a
height
that
as
rube
assured
us
it
could
not
subside
for
hours
it
was
then
resolved
that
we
should
continue
our
journey
it
was
near
midnight
when
we
drew
our
pickets
and
rode
off
the
rain
had
partially
blinded
the
trail
made
by
el
sol
and
his
party
but
the
men
who
now
followed
it
were
not
much
used
to
and
rube
acting
as
leader
lifted
it
at
a
trot
at
intervals
the
flashes
of
lightning
showed
the
mule
tracks
in
the
mud
and
the
white
peak
that
beckoned
us
in
the
distance
we
travelled
all
night
an
hour
after
sunrise
we
overtook
the
atajo
near
the
base
of
the
snow
mountain
we
halted
in
the
mountain
pass
and
after
a
short
while
spent
in
cooking
and
eating
breakfast
continued
our
journey
across
the
sierra
the
road
led
through
a
dry
ravine
into
an
open
plain
that
stretched
east
and
south
beyond
the
reach
of
our
vision
it
was
a
desert
i
will
not
detail
the
events
that
occurred
to
us
in
the
passage
of
that
terrible
jornada
they
were
similar
to
those
we
experienced
in
the
deserts
to
the
west
we
suffered
from
thirst
making
one
stretch
of
sixty
miles
without
water
we
passed
over
plains
without
a
living
object
to
break
the
monotony
that
extended
around
us
we
cooked
our
meals
over
the
blaze
of
the
artemisia
but
our
provisions
gave
out
and
the
pack
mules
one
by
one
fell
under
the
knives
of
the
hungry
hunters
by
night
we
camped
without
fires
we
dared
not
kindle
them
for
though
as
yet
no
pursuers
had
appeared
we
knew
they
must
be
on
our
trail
we
had
travelled
with
such
speed
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
come
up
with
us
for
three
days
we
headed
towards
the
on
the
evening
of
the
third
we
descried
the
mimbres
mountains
towering
up
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
desert
the
peaks
of
these
were
well
known
to
the
hunters
and
became
our
guides
as
we
journeyed
on
we
approached
the
mimbres
in
a
diagonal
direction
as
it
was
our
purpose
to
pass
through
the
sierra
by
the
route
of
the
old
mine
once
the
prosperous
property
of
our
chief
to
him
every
feature
of
the
landscape
was
a
familiar
object
i
observed
that
his
spirits
rose
as
we
proceeded
onward
at
sundown
we
reached
the
head
of
the
barranca
del
oro
a
vast
cleft
that
traversed
the
plain
leading
down
to
the
deserted
mine
this
chasm
like
a
fissure
caused
by
some
terrible
earthquake
extended
for
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
on
either
side
was
a
trail
for
on
both
the
ran
in
horizontally
to
the
very
lips
of
the
abyss
about
midway
to
the
mine
on
the
left
brow
the
guide
knew
of
a
spring
and
we
proceeded
towards
this
with
the
intention
of
camping
by
the
water
we
dragged
wearily
along
it
was
near
midnight
when
we
arrived
at
the
spring
our
horses
were
unsaddled
and
staked
on
the
open
plain
here
seguin
had
resolved
that
we
should
rest
longer
than
usual
a
feeling
of
security
had
come
over
him
as
he
approached
these
scenes
there
was
a
thicket
of
young
and
willows
fringing
the
spring
and
in
the
heart
of
this
a
fire
was
kindled
another
mule
was
sacrificed
to
the
manes
of
hunger
and
the
hunters
after
devouring
the
tough
steaks
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
and
slept
the
only
out
by
the
caballada
stood
leaning
upon
his
rifle
silent
and
watchful
resting
my
head
in
the
hollow
of
my
saddle
i
lay
down
by
the
fire
seguin
was
near
me
with
his
daughter
the
mexican
girls
and
the
indian
captives
lay
clustered
over
the
ground
wrapped
in
their
tilmas
and
striped
blankets
they
were
all
asleep
or
seemed
so
i
was
as
wearied
as
the
rest
but
my
thoughts
kept
me
awake
my
mind
was
busy
with
the
bright
future
soon
thought
i
shall
i
escape
from
these
horrid
scenes
soon
shall
i
breathe
a
purer
atmosphere
in
the
sweet
companionship
of
my
beloved
zoe
beautiful
zoe
before
two
days
have
passed
i
shall
again
be
with
you
press
your
impassioned
lips
call
you
my
loved
my
own
again
shall
we
wander
through
the
silent
garden
by
the
river
groves
again
shall
we
sit
upon
the
seats
in
the
still
evening
hours
again
shall
we
utter
those
wild
words
that
caused
our
hearts
to
vibrate
with
mutual
happiness
zoe
pure
and
innocent
as
the
angels
the
simplicity
of
that
question
enrique
what
is
to
marry
ah
sweet
zoe
you
shall
soon
learn
ere
long
i
shall
teach
you
ere
long
wilt
thou
be
mine
for
ever
mine
zoe
zoe
are
you
awake
do
you
lie
sleepless
on
your
soft
couch
or
am
i
present
in
your
dreams
do
you
long
for
my
return
as
i
to
hasten
it
oh
that
the
night
were
past
i
can
not
wait
for
rest
i
could
ride
on
sleepless
tireless
on
on
my
eye
rested
upon
the
features
of
adele
upturned
and
shining
in
the
blaze
of
the
fire
i
traced
the
outlines
of
her
sister
face
the
high
noble
front
the
arched
eyebrow
and
the
curving
nostril
but
the
brightness
of
complexion
was
not
there
the
smile
of
angelic
innocence
was
not
there
the
hair
was
dark
the
skin
browned
and
there
was
a
wildness
in
the
expression
of
the
eye
stamped
no
doubt
by
the
experience
of
many
a
savage
scene
still
was
she
beautiful
but
it
was
beauty
of
a
far
less
spiritual
order
than
that
of
my
betrothed
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
short
irregular
pulsations
once
or
twice
while
i
was
gazing
she
half
awoke
and
muttered
some
words
in
the
indian
tongue
her
sleep
was
troubled
and
broken
during
the
journey
seguin
had
waited
upon
her
with
all
the
tender
solicitude
of
a
father
but
she
had
received
his
attentions
with
indifference
or
at
most
regarded
them
with
a
cold
thankfulness
it
was
difficult
to
analyse
the
feelings
that
actuated
her
most
of
the
time
she
remained
silent
and
sullen
the
father
endeavoured
once
or
twice
to
resuscitate
the
memories
of
her
childhood
but
without
success
and
with
sorrow
at
his
heart
he
had
each
time
relinquished
the
attempt
i
thought
he
was
asleep
i
was
mistaken
on
looking
more
attentively
in
his
face
i
saw
that
he
was
regarding
her
with
deep
interest
and
listening
to
the
broken
phrases
that
fell
from
her
lips
there
was
a
picture
of
sorrow
and
anxiety
in
his
look
that
touched
me
to
the
heart
as
i
watched
him
the
girl
murmured
some
words
to
me
unintelligible
but
among
them
i
recognised
the
name
dacoma
i
saw
that
seguin
started
as
he
heard
it
poor
child
said
he
seeing
that
i
was
awake
she
is
dreaming
and
a
troubled
dream
it
is
i
have
half
a
mind
to
wake
her
out
of
it
she
needs
rest
i
replied
ay
if
that
be
rest
listen
again
it
is
the
name
of
the
captive
chief
ay
they
were
to
have
been
married
according
to
their
laws
but
how
did
you
learn
this
from
rube
he
heard
it
while
he
was
a
prisoner
at
the
town
and
did
she
love
him
do
you
think
no
it
appears
not
she
had
been
adopted
as
the
daughter
of
the
medicine
chief
and
dacoma
claimed
her
for
a
wife
on
certain
conditions
she
was
to
have
been
given
to
him
but
she
feared
not
loved
him
as
her
words
now
testify
poor
child
a
wayward
fate
has
been
hers
in
two
journeys
more
her
sufferings
will
be
over
she
will
be
restored
to
her
home
to
her
mother
ah
if
she
should
remain
thus
it
will
break
the
heart
of
my
poor
adele
fear
not
my
friend
time
will
restore
her
memory
i
think
i
have
heard
of
a
parallel
circumstance
among
the
frontier
settlements
of
the
mississippi
oh
true
there
have
been
many
we
will
hope
for
the
best
once
in
her
home
the
objects
that
surrounded
her
in
her
younger
days
may
strike
a
chord
in
her
recollection
she
may
yet
remember
all
may
she
not
hope
hope
at
all
events
the
companionship
of
her
mother
and
sister
will
soon
win
her
from
the
thoughts
of
savage
life
fear
not
she
will
be
your
daughter
again
i
urged
these
ideas
for
the
purpose
of
giving
consolation
seguin
made
no
reply
but
i
saw
that
the
painful
and
anxious
expression
still
remained
clouding
his
features
my
own
heart
was
not
without
its
heaviness
a
dark
foreboding
began
to
creep
into
it
from
some
undefined
cause
were
his
thoughts
in
communion
with
mine
how
long
i
asked
before
we
can
reach
your
house
on
the
del
norte
i
scarce
knew
why
i
was
prompted
to
put
this
question
some
fear
that
we
were
still
in
peril
from
the
pursuing
foe
the
day
after
he
replied
by
the
evening
heaven
grant
we
may
find
them
safe
i
started
as
the
words
issued
from
his
lips
they
had
brought
pain
in
an
instant
this
was
the
true
cause
of
my
undefined
forebodings
you
have
fears
i
inquired
hastily
i
have
of
what
of
whom
the
navajoes
the
navajoes
yes
my
mind
has
not
been
easy
since
i
saw
them
go
eastward
from
the
pinon
i
can
not
understand
why
they
did
so
unless
they
meditated
an
attack
on
some
settlements
that
lie
on
the
old
llanos
trail
if
not
that
my
fears
are
that
they
have
made
a
descent
on
the
valley
of
el
paso
perhaps
on
the
town
itself
one
thing
may
have
prevented
them
from
attacking
the
town
the
separation
of
dacoma
party
which
would
leave
them
too
weak
for
that
but
still
the
more
danger
to
the
small
settlements
both
north
and
south
of
it
the
uneasiness
i
had
hitherto
felt
arose
from
an
expression
which
seguin
had
dropped
at
the
pinon
spring
my
mind
had
dwelt
upon
it
from
time
to
time
during
our
desert
journeyings
but
as
he
did
not
speak
of
it
afterwards
i
thought
that
he
had
not
attached
so
much
importance
to
it
i
had
reasoned
wrongly
it
is
just
probable
continued
the
chief
that
the
passenos
may
defend
themselves
they
have
done
so
heretofore
with
more
spirit
than
any
of
the
other
settlements
and
hence
their
long
exemption
from
being
plundered
partly
that
and
partly
because
our
band
has
protected
their
neighbourhood
for
a
length
of
time
which
the
savages
well
know
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
fear
of
meeting
with
us
will
prevent
them
from
coming
into
the
jornada
north
of
the
town
if
so
ours
have
escaped
god
grant
i
faltered
that
it
may
be
thus
let
us
sleep
added
seguin
perhaps
our
apprehensions
are
idle
and
they
can
benefit
nothing
we
shall
march
forward
without
halt
if
our
animals
can
bear
it
go
to
rest
my
friend
you
have
not
much
time
so
saying
he
laid
his
head
in
his
saddle
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
in
a
short
while
as
if
by
an
act
of
volition
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
profound
slumber
with
me
it
was
different
sleep
was
banished
from
my
eyes
and
i
tossed
about
with
a
throbbing
pulse
and
a
brain
filled
with
fearful
fancies
the
very
reaction
from
the
bright
dreams
in
which
i
had
just
been
indulging
rendered
my
apprehensions
painfully
active
i
began
to
imagine
scenes
that
might
be
enacting
at
that
very
moment
my
betrothed
struggling
in
the
arms
of
some
savage
for
these
southern
indians
i
knew
possessed
none
of
the
chivalrous
delicacy
that
characterise
the
red
men
of
the
forest
i
fancied
her
carried
into
a
rude
captivity
becoming
the
squaw
of
some
brutal
brave
and
with
the
agony
of
the
thought
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
rushed
out
upon
the
prairie
i
wandered
not
heeding
whither
i
went
i
must
have
walked
for
hours
but
i
took
no
note
of
the
time
i
strayed
back
upon
the
edge
of
the
barranca
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
but
the
grim
chasm
yawning
away
into
the
earth
at
my
feet
lay
buried
in
silence
and
darkness
my
eye
could
not
pierce
its
fathomless
gloom
i
saw
the
camp
and
the
caballada
far
above
me
on
the
bank
but
my
strength
was
exhausted
and
giving
way
to
my
weariness
i
sank
down
upon
the
very
brink
of
the
abyss
the
keen
torture
that
had
hitherto
sustained
me
was
followed
by
a
feeling
of
utter
lassitude
sleep
conquered
agony
and
i
slept
chapter
forty
two
the
foe
i
must
have
slept
an
hour
or
more
had
my
dreams
been
realities
they
would
have
filled
the
measure
of
an
age
at
length
the
raw
air
of
the
morning
chilled
and
awoke
me
the
moon
had
gone
down
for
i
remembered
that
she
was
close
to
the
horizon
when
i
last
saw
her
still
it
was
far
from
being
dark
for
i
could
see
to
a
considerable
distance
through
the
fog
perhaps
the
day
is
breaking
thought
i
and
i
turned
my
face
to
the
east
it
was
as
i
had
guessed
the
eastern
sky
was
streaked
with
light
it
was
morning
i
knew
it
was
the
intention
of
seguin
to
start
early
and
i
was
about
summoning
resolution
to
raise
myself
when
voices
broke
on
my
ear
there
were
short
exclamatory
phrases
and
upon
the
prairie
turf
they
are
up
and
preparing
to
start
with
this
thought
i
leaped
to
my
feet
and
commenced
hurrying
towards
the
camp
i
had
not
walked
ten
paces
when
i
became
conscious
that
the
voices
were
behind
me
i
stopped
and
listened
yes
beyond
a
doubt
i
was
going
from
them
i
have
mistaken
the
way
to
the
camp
and
i
stepped
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
barranca
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
myself
what
was
my
astonishment
to
find
that
i
had
been
going
in
the
right
direction
and
that
the
sounds
were
coming
from
the
opposite
quarter
my
first
thought
was
that
the
band
had
passed
me
and
were
moving
on
the
route
but
no
seguin
would
not
oh
he
has
sent
of
a
party
to
search
for
me
it
is
they
i
called
out
hollo
to
let
them
know
where
i
was
there
was
no
answer
and
i
shouted
again
louder
than
before
all
at
once
the
sounds
ceased
i
knew
the
horsemen
were
listening
and
i
called
once
more
at
the
top
of
my
voice
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
i
could
hear
a
muttering
of
many
voices
and
the
trampling
of
horses
as
they
galloped
towards
me
i
wondered
that
none
of
them
had
yet
answered
my
signal
but
my
wonder
was
changed
into
consternation
when
i
perceived
that
the
approaching
party
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
barranca
before
i
could
recover
from
my
surprise
they
were
opposite
me
and
reining
up
on
the
bank
of
the
chasm
they
were
still
three
hundred
yards
distant
the
width
of
the
gulf
but
i
could
see
them
plainly
through
the
thin
and
filmy
fog
there
appeared
in
all
about
a
hundred
horsemen
and
their
long
spears
their
plumed
heads
and
bodies
told
me
at
a
glance
they
were
indians
i
stayed
to
inquire
no
further
but
ran
with
all
my
speed
for
the
camp
i
could
see
the
horsemen
on
the
opposite
cliff
keeping
pace
with
me
at
a
slow
gallop
on
reaching
the
spring
i
found
the
hunters
in
surprise
and
vaulting
into
their
saddles
seguin
and
a
few
others
had
gone
out
on
the
extreme
edge
and
were
looking
over
they
had
not
thought
of
an
immediate
retreat
as
the
enemy
having
the
advantage
of
the
light
had
already
discovered
the
strength
of
our
party
though
only
a
distance
of
three
hundred
yards
separated
the
hostile
bands
twenty
miles
would
have
to
be
passed
before
they
could
meet
in
battle
on
this
account
seguin
and
the
hunters
felt
secure
for
the
time
and
it
was
hastily
resolved
to
remain
where
we
were
until
we
had
examined
who
and
what
were
our
opponents
they
had
halted
on
the
opposite
bank
and
sat
in
their
saddles
gazing
across
they
seemed
puzzled
at
our
appearance
it
was
still
too
dark
for
them
to
distinguish
our
complexions
soon
however
it
grew
clearer
our
peculiar
dress
and
equipments
were
recognised
and
a
wild
yell
the
navajo
came
pealing
over
the
abyss
it
dacoma
party
cried
a
voice
they
have
taken
the
wrong
side
the
gully
no
exclaimed
another
thar
too
few
o
them
for
dacoma
men
thar
ai
over
a
hundred
maybe
the
flood
tuk
the
rest
suggested
the
first
speaker
wagh
how
could
they
missed
our
trail
that
as
plain
as
a
waggon
track
them
nohow
who
then

navagh

kud
tell

said
rube
at
this
moment
riding
forward
looke
yonder
the
old
skunk
hisself
on
the
spotted
hoss
you
think
it
is
they
rube
inquired
seguin
sure
as
shootin
cap
but
where
are
the
rest
of
his
band
these
are
not
all
they
ai
far
off
i
be
boun
i
hear
them
yonder
a
crowd
look
boys
look
through
the
fog
now
floating
away
a
dark
body
of
mounted
men
were
seen
coming
up
the
opposite
side
they
advanced
with
shouts
and
ejaculations
as
though
they
were
driving
cattle
it
was
so
as
the
fog
rose
up
we
could
see
a
drove
of
horses
horned
cattle
and
sheep
covering
the
plain
to
a
great
distance
behind
these
rode
mounted
indians
who
galloped
to
and
fro
goading
the
animals
with
their
spears
and
pushing
them
forward
lord
what
a
plunder
exclaimed
one
of
the
hunters
ay
them
the
fellows
have
made
something
by
thar
expedition
we
are
comin
back
empty
as
we
went
wagh
i
had
been
engaged
in
saddling
my
horse
and
at
this
moment
came
forward
it
was
not
upon
the
indians
that
my
eye
rested
nor
upon
the
plundered
cattle
another
object
attracted
my
gaze
and
sent
the
blood
curdling
to
my
heart
away
in
the
rear
of
the
advancing
drove
i
saw
a
small
party
distinct
from
the
rest
their
light
dresses
fluttering
in
the
wind
told
me
that
they
were
not
indians
they
were
women
they
were
captives
there
appeared
to
be
about
twenty
in
all
but
my
feelings
were
such
that
i
took
little
heed
of
their
number
i
saw
that
they
were
mounted
and
that
each
was
guarded
by
an
indian
who
rode
by
her
side
with
a
palpitating
heart
i
passed
my
eye
over
the
group
from
one
to
the
other
but
the
distance
was
too
great
to
distinguish
the
features
of
any
of
them
i
turned
towards
the
chief
he
was
standing
with
the
glass
to
his
eye
i
saw
him
start
his
cheek
suddenly
blanched
his
lips
quivered
convulsively
and
the
instrument
fell
from
his
fingers
to
the
ground
with
a
wild
look
he
staggered
back
crying
out
mon
dieu
mon
dieu
oh
god
thou
hast
stricken
me
now
i
snatched
up
the
telescope
to
assure
myself
but
it
needed
not
that
as
i
was
raising
it
an
object
running
along
the
opposite
side
caught
my
eye
it
was
the
dog
alp
i
levelled
the
glass
and
the
next
moment
was
gazing
through
it
on
the
face
of
my
betrothed
so
close
did
she
seem
that
i
could
hardly
restrain
myself
from
calling
to
her
i
could
distinguish
her
pale
beautiful
features
her
cheek
was
wan
with
weeping
and
her
rich
golden
hair
hung
dishevelled
from
her
shoulders
reaching
to
the
withers
of
her
horse
she
was
covered
with
a
serape
and
a
young
indian
rode
beside
her
mounted
upon
a
showy
horse
and
dressed
in
the
habiliments
of
a
mexican
hussar
i
looked
at
none
of
the
others
though
a
glance
showed
me
her
mother
in
the
string
of
captives
that
came
after
the
drove
of
horses
and
cattle
soon
passed
up
and
the
females
with
their
guards
arrived
opposite
us
the
captives
were
left
back
on
the
prairie
while
the
warriors
rode
forward
to
where
their
comrades
had
halted
by
the
brow
of
the
barranca
it
was
now
bright
day
the
fog
had
cleared
away
and
across
the
impassable
gulf
the
hostile
bands
stood
gazing
at
each
other
chapter
forty
three
new
misery
it
was
a
most
singular
rencontre
here
were
two
parties
of
men
to
one
another
each
returning
from
the
country
of
the
other
loaded
with
plunder
and
carrying
a
train
of
captives
they
had
met
midway
and
stood
within
musket
range
gazing
at
each
other
with
feelings
of
the
most
bitter
hostility
and
yet
a
conflict
was
as
impossible
as
though
twenty
miles
of
the
earth
surface
lay
between
them
on
one
side
were
the
navajoes
with
consternation
in
their
looks
for
the
warriors
had
recognised
their
children
on
the
other
stood
the
not
a
few
of
whom
in
the
captive
train
of
their
enemies
could
distinguish
the
features
of
a
wife
a
sister
or
a
daughter
each
gazed
upon
the
other
with
hostile
hearts
and
glances
of
revenge
had
they
met
thus
on
the
open
prairie
they
would
have
fought
to
the
death
it
seemed
as
though
the
hand
of
god
had
interposed
to
prevent
the
ruthless
shedding
of
blood
which
but
for
the
gulf
that
lay
between
these
foemen
would
certainly
have
ensued
i
can
not
describe
how
i
felt
at
the
moment
i
remember
that
all
at
once
i
was
inspired
with
a
new
vigour
both
of
mind
and
body
hitherto
i
had
been
little
more
than
a
passive
spectator
of
the
events
of
our
expedition
i
had
been
acting
without
any
stimulating
now
i
had
one
that
roused
me
to
a
desperate
energy
a
thought
occurred
to
me
and
i
ran
up
to
communicate
it
seguin
was
beginning
to
recover
from
the
terrible
blow
the
men
had
learnt
the
cause
of
his
strange
behaviour
and
stood
around
him
some
of
them
endeavouring
to
console
him
few
of
them
knew
aught
of
the
family
affairs
of
their
chief
but
they
had
heard
of
his
earlier
misfortunes
the
loss
of
his
mine
the
ruin
of
his
property
the
captivity
of
his
child
now
when
it
became
known
that
among
the
prisoners
of
the
enemy
were
his
wife
and
daughter
even
the
rude
hearts
of
the
hunters
were
touched
with
pity
at
his
more
than
common
sufferings
compassionate
exclamations
were
heard
from
them
mingled
with
expressions
of
their
determination
to
restore
the
captives
or
die
in
the
attempt
it
was
with
the
intention
of
exciting
such
a
feeling
that
i
had
come
forward
it
was
my
design
out
of
my
small
stock
of
world
wealth
to
set
a
premium
on
devotedness
and
valour
but
i
saw
that
nobler
motives
had
anticipated
me
and
i
remained
silent
seguin
seemed
pleased
at
the
loyalty
of
his
comrades
and
began
to
exhibit
his
wonted
energy
hope
again
had
possession
of
him
the
men
clustered
round
him
to
offer
their
advice
and
listen
to
his
directions
we
can
fight
them
said
the
trapper
garey
thar
ai
over
two
hundred
jest
a
hundred
and
interposed
a
hunter
without
the
weemen
i
counted
them
that
thar
number
wal
continued
garey
thar
some
difference
atween
us
in
point
pluck
i
reckin
and
what
wantin
in
number
we
make
up
wi
our
rifles
i
never
valleys
two
to
one
wi
injuns
an
a
trifle
throw
in
if
ye
like
look
at
the
ground
bill
it
all
plain
whar
would
we
be
after
a
volley
they
have
the
advantage
wi
their
bows
and
lances
wagh
they
could
spear
us
to
pieces
thar
i
did
say
we
could
take
them
on
the
paraira
we
kin
foller
them
till
they
in
the
mountains
an
git
them
among
the
rocks
what
i
advise
ay
they
ca
run
away
from
us
with
that
drove
that
sartin
they
have
no
notion
of
running
away
they
will
most
likely
attack
us
that
jest
what
we
want
said
garey
we
kin
go
yonder
and
fight
them
till
they
had
a
bellyful
the
trapper
as
he
spoke
pointed
to
the
foot
of
the
mimbres
that
lay
about
ten
miles
off
to
the
eastward
maybe
they
wait
till
more
comes
up
there
more
of
head
party
than
these
there
were
nearly
four
hundred
when
they
passed
the
pinon
rube
where
can
the
rest
of
them
be
demanded
seguin
i
can
see
down
to
the
mine
and
they
are
not
upon
the
plain
ai
to
be
cap
some
luck
in
that
i
reckin
the
ole
fool
has
sent
a
party
by
trail
on
the
wrong
scent
them
is
why
do
you
think
they
have
gone
by
the
other
trail
why
cap
it
stans
for
raison
if
they
wur

back
afore
this
to
hurry
up
do
see
thur
hai
gone
a
one
as
i
seed
you
are
right
rube
replied
seguin
encouraged
by
the
probability
of
what
the
other
had
asserted
what
do
you
advise
us
continued
he
appealing
to
the
old
trapper
whose
counsel
he
was
in
the
habit
of
seeking
in
all
cases
of
similar
difficulty
wal
cap
it
a
twistified
piece
o
business
as
it
stans
an
i
figured
it
out
to
my
satersfaction
jest
yet
if
gi
me
a
kupple
o
minutes
i
answer
ye
to
the
best
o
my
possibilities
very
well
we
will
wait
for
you
men
look
to
your
arms
and
see
that
they
are
all
in
readiness
during
this
consultation
which
had
occupied
but
a
few
seconds
of
time
we
could
see
that
the
enemy
was
similarly
employed
on
the
other
side
they
had
drawn
around
their
chief
and
from
their
gesticulations
it
was
plain
they
were
deliberating
how
they
should
act
our
appearance
with
the
children
of
their
principal
men
as
captives
had
filled
them
with
consternation
at
what
they
saw
and
apprehensions
of
a
fearful
kind
for
what
they
saw
not
returning
from
a
successful
foray
laden
with
spoil
and
big
with
the
prospect
of
feasting
and
triumph
they
suddenly
perceived
themselves
at
their
own
game
they
knew
we
had
been
to
their
town
they
conjectured
that
we
had
plundered
and
burnt
their
houses
and
massacred
their
women
and
children
they
fancied
no
less
for
this
was
the
very
work
in
which
they
had
themselves
been
engaged
and
their
judgment
was
drawn
from
their
own
conduct
they
saw
moreover
that
we
were
a
large
party
able
to
defend
what
we
had
taken
at
least
against
them
for
they
knew
well
that
with
their
firearms
the
were
an
for
them
when
there
was
anything
like
an
equality
of
numbers
with
these
ideas
then
it
required
deliberation
on
their
part
as
well
as
with
us
and
we
knew
that
it
would
be
some
time
before
they
would
act
they
too
were
in
a
dilemma
the
hunters
obeyed
the
injunctions
of
seguin
and
remained
silent
waiting
upon
rube
to
deliver
his
advice
the
old
trapper
stood
apart
upon
his
rifle
which
he
clutched
with
both
hands
near
the
muzzle
he
had
taken
out
the
stopper
and
was
looking
into
the
barrel
as
if
he
were
consulting
some
oracular
spirit
that
he
kept
bottled
up
within
it
it
was
one
of
rube
peculiar
ways
and
those
who
knew
this
were
seen
to
smile
as
they
watched
him
after
a
few
minutes
spent
in
this
silent
entreaty
the
oracle
seemed
to
have
sent
forth
its
response
and
rube
returning
the
stopper
to
its
place
came
walking
forward
to
the
chief
billee
right
cap
if
them
injuns
must
be
fit
it

the

pointed
to

of

if

we
can
do

how

that
crik
too
well
the
probability
of
dacoma
band
soon
joining
those
of
the
head
chief
was
apparent
to
all
and
cast
a
shadow
of
despondency
over
every
face
they
were
no
doubt
still
in
pursuit
of
us
and
would
soon
arrive

seguin
his
eye

with
the
anticipation

happy
result

to

seguin
comrades

forward
the
captives

the
edge
of
the
barranca
bring
the
navajo
chief
bring
the
my
daughter
the
men
hurried
to
obey
the
command
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
captive
children
with
dacoma
and
the
mystery
queen
were
led
forward
to
the
very
brink
of
the
chasm
the
serapes
that
had
shrouded
them
were
removed
and
they
stood
exposed
in
their
usual
costumes
before
the
eyes
of
the
indians
dacoma
still
wore
his
helmet
and
the
queen
was
conspicuous
in
the
rich
tunic
they
were
at
once
recognised
a
cry
of
singular
import
burst
from
the
navajoes
as
they
beheld
these
new
proofs
of
their
discomfiture
the
warriors
unslung
their
lances
and
thrust
them
into
the
earth
with
impotent
indignation
some
of
them
drew
scalps
from
their
belts
stuck
them
on
the
points
of
their
spears
and
shook
them
at
us
over
the
brow
of
the
abyss
they
believed
that
dacoma
band
had
been
destroyed
as
well
as
their
women
and
children
and
they
threatened
us
with
shouts
and
gestures
in
the
midst
of
all
this
we
noticed
a
movement
among
the
more
staid
warriors
a
consultation
was
going
on
it
ended
a
party
were
seen
to
gallop
toward
the
captive
women
who
had
been
left
far
back
upon
the
plain
great
heavens
cried
i
struck
with
a
horrid
idea
they
are
going
to
butcher
them
quick
with
the
flag
but
before
the
banner
could
be
attached
to
its
staff
the
mexican
women
were
dismounted
their
rebozos
pulled
off
and
they
were
led
forward
to
the
precipice
it
was
only
meant
for
a
the
retaliation
of
a
pang
for
it
was
evident
the
savages
knew
that
among
their
captives
were
the
wife
and
daughter
of
our
chief
these
were
placed
conspicuously
in
front
upon
the
very
brow
of
the
barranca
chapter
forty
four
the
flag
of
truce
they
might
have
spared
themselves
the
pains
that
agony
was
already
felt
but
indeed
a
scene
followed
that
caused
us
to
suffer
afresh
up
to
this
moment
we
had
not
been
recognised
by
those
near
and
dear
to
us
the
distance
had
been
too
great
for
the
naked
eye
and
our
browned
faces
and
habiliments
were
of
themselves
a
disguise
but
the
instincts
of
love
are
quick
and
keen
and
the
eyes
of
my
betrothed
were
upon
me
i
saw
her
start
forward
i
heard
the
agonised
scream
a
pair
of
arms
were
extended
and
she
sank
fainting
upon
the
cliff
at
the
same
instant
madame
seguin
had
recognised
the
chief
and
had
called
him
by
name
seguin
shouted
to
her
in
reply
and
cautioned
her
in
tones
of
intreaty
to
remain
patient
and
silent
several
of
the
other
females
all
young
and
handsome
had
recognised
their
lovers
and
brothers
and
a
scene
followed
that
was
painful
to
witness
but
my
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
i
saw
that
she
recovered
from
her
swoon
i
saw
the
savage
in
hussar
trappings
dismount
and
lifting
her
in
his
arms
carry
her
back
upon
the
prairie
i
followed
them
with
impotent
gaze
i
saw
that
he
was
paying
her
kind
attentions
and
i
almost
thanked
him
though
i
knew
it
was
but
the
selfish
gallantry
of
the
lover
in
a
short
while
she
rose
to
her
feet
again
and
rushed
back
toward
the
barranca
i
heard
my
name
uttered
across
the
ravine
hers
was
echoed
back
but
at
the
moment
both
mother
and
daughter
were
surrounded
by
their
guards
and
carried
back
meanwhile
the
white
flag
had
been
got
ready
and
seguin
holding
it
aloft
stood
out
in
front
we
remained
silent
watching
with
eager
glances
for
the
answer
there
was
a
movement
among
the
clustered
indians
we
heard
their
voices
in
earnest
talk
and
saw
that
something
was
going
on
in
their
midst
presently
a
tall
man
came
out
from
the
crowd
holding
an
object
in
his
left
hand
of
a
white
colour
it
was
a
bleached
in
his
right
hand
he
carried
a
lance
we
saw
him
place
the
on
the
blade
of
the
lance
and
stand
forward
holding
it
aloft
our
signal
of
peace
was
answered
silence
men
cried
seguin
speaking
to
the
hunters
and
then
raising
his
voice
he
called
aloud
in
the
indian
language
navajoes
you
know
whom
we
are
we
have
passed
through
your
country
and
visited
your
head
town
our
object
was
to
search
for
our
dear
relatives
who
we
knew
were
captives
in
your
land
some
we
have
recovered
but
there
are
many
others
we
could
not
find
that
these
might
be
restored
to
us
in
time
we
have
taken
hostages
as
you
see
we
might
have
brought
away
many
more
but
these
we
considered
enough
we
have
not
burned
your
town
we
have
not
harmed
your
wives
your
daughters
nor
your
children
with
the
exception
of
these
our
prisoners
you
will
find
all
as
you
left
them
a
murmur
ran
through
the
ranks
of
the
indians
it
was
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
they
had
been
under
the
full
belief
that
their
town
was
destroyed
and
their
women
massacred
and
the
words
of
seguin
therefore
produced
a
singular
effect
we
could
hear
joyful
exclamations
and
phrases
interchanged
among
the
warriors
silence
was
again
restored
and
seguin
continued
we
see
that
you
have
been
in
our
country
you
have
made
captives
as
well
as
we
you
are
red
men
red
men
can
feel
for
their
kindred
as
well
as
white
men
we
know
this
and
for
that
reason
have
i
raised
the
banner
of
peace
that
each
may
restore
to
the
other
his
own
it
will
please
the
great
spirit
and
will
give
satisfaction
to
both
of
us
for
that
which
you
hold
is
of
most
value
to
us
and
that
which
we
have
is
dear
only
to
you
navajoes
i
have
spoken
i
await
your
answer
when
seguin
had
ended
the
warriors
gathered
around
the
head
chief
and
we
could
see
that
an
earnest
debate
was
going
on
amongst
them
it
was
plain
there
were
dissenting
voices
but
the
debate
was
soon
over
and
the
head
chief
stepping
forward
gave
some
instructions
to
the
man
who
held
the
flag
the
latter
in
a
loud
voice
replied
to
seguin
speech
as
follows
white
chief
you
have
spoken
well
and
your
words
have
been
weighed
by
our
warriors
you
ask
nothing
more
than
what
is
just
and
fair
it
would
please
the
great
spirit
and
satisfy
us
to
exchange
our
captives
but
how
can
we
tell
that
your
words
are
true
you
say
that
you
have
not
burned
our
town
nor
harmed
our
women
and
children
how
can
we
know
that
this
is
true
our
town
is
far
off
so
are
our
women
if
they
be
still
alive
we
can
not
ask
them
we
have
only
your
word
it
is
not
enough
seguin
had
already
anticipated
this
difficulty
and
had
ordered
one
of
our
captives
an
intelligent
lad
to
be
brought
forward
the
boy
at
this
moment
appeared
by
his
side
question
him
shouted
he
pointing
to
the
captive
lad
and
why
may
we
not
question
our
brother
the
chief
dacoma
the
lad
is
young
he
may
not
understand
us
the
chief
could
assure
us
better
dacoma
was
not
with
us
at
the
town
he
knows
not
what
was
done
there
let
dacoma
answer
that
brother
replied
seguin
you
are
wrongly
suspicious
but
you
shall
have
his
answer
and
he
addressed
some
words
to
the
navajo
chief
who
sat
near
him
upon
the
ground
the
question
was
then
put
directly
to
dacoma
by
the
speaker
on
the
other
side
the
proud
indian
who
seemed
exasperated
with
the
humiliating
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
with
an
angry
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
short
ejaculation
answered
in
the
negative
now
brother
proceeded
seguin
you
see
i
have
spoken
truly
ask
the
lad
what
you
first
proposed
the
boy
was
then
interrogated
as
to
whether
we
had
burnt
the
town
or
harmed
the
women
and
children
to
these
two
questions
he
also
returned
a
negative
answer
well
brother
said
seguin
are
you
satisfied
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
reply
the
warriors
were
again
gathered
in
council
and
gesticulating
with
earnestness
and
energy
we
could
see
that
there
was
a
party
opposed
to
pacific
measures
who
were
evidently
counselling
the
others
to
try
the
fortunes
of
a
battle
these
were
the
younger
braves
and
i
observed
that
he
in
the
hussar
costume
who
as
rube
informed
us
was
the
son
of
the
head
chief
appeared
to
be
the
leader
of
this
party
had
not
the
head
chief
been
so
deeply
interested
in
the
result
the
counsels
of
these
might
have
carried
for
the
warriors
well
knew
the
scorn
that
would
await
them
among
neighbouring
tribes
should
they
return
without
captives
besides
there
were
numbers
who
felt
another
sort
of
interest
in
detaining
them
they
had
looked
upon
the
daughters
of
the
del
norte
and
saw
that
they
were
fair
but
the
counsels
of
the
older
men
at
length
prevailed
and
the
spokesman
replied
the
navajo
warriors
have
considered
what
they
have
heard
they
believe
that
the
white
chief
has
spoken
the
truth
and
they
agree
to
exchange
their
prisoners
that
this
may
be
done
in
a
proper
and
becoming
manner
they
propose
that
twenty
warriors
be
chosen
on
each
side
that
these
warriors
shall
lay
down
their
arms
on
the
prairie
in
presence
of
all
that
they
shall
then
conduct
their
captives
to
the
crossing
of
the
barranca
by
the
mine
and
there
settle
the
terms
of
their
exchange
that
all
the
others
on
both
sides
shall
remain
where
they
now
are
until
the
unarmed
warriors
have
got
back
with
the
exchanged
prisoners
that
the
white
banners
shall
then
be
struck
and
both
sides
be
freed
from
the
treaty
these
are
the
words
of
the
navajo
warriors
it
was
some
time
before
seguin
could
reply
to
this
proposal
it
seemed
fair
enough
but
yet
there
was
a
manner
about
it
that
led
us
to
suspect
some
design
and
we
paused
a
moment
to
consider
it
the
concluding
terms
intimated
an
intention
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
of
making
an
attempt
to
retake
their
captives
but
we
cared
little
for
this
provided
we
could
once
get
them
on
our
side
of
the
barranca
it
was
very
proper
that
the
prisoners
should
be
conducted
to
the
place
of
exchange
by
unarmed
men
and
twenty
was
a
proper
number
but
seguin
well
knew
how
the
navajoes
would
interpret
the
word
unarmed
and
several
of
the
hunters
were
cautioned
in
an
undertone
to
stray
into
the
bushes
and
conceal
their
knives
and
pistols
under
the
flaps
of
their
we
thought
that
we
observed
a
similar
manoeuvre
going
on
upon
the
opposite
bank
with
the
tomahawks
of
our
adversaries
we
could
make
but
little
objection
to
the
terms
proposed
and
as
seguin
knew
that
time
saved
was
an
important
object
he
hastened
to
accept
them
as
soon
as
this
was
announced
to
the
navajoes
twenty
men
already
chosen
no
doubt
stepped
out
into
the
open
prairie
and
striking
their
lances
into
the
ground
rested
against
them
their
bows
quivers
and
shields
we
saw
no
tomahawks
and
we
knew
that
every
navajo
carries
this
weapon
they
all
had
the
means
of
concealing
them
about
their
persons
for
most
of
them
were
dressed
in
the
garb
of
civilised
life
in
the
plundered
habiliments
of
the
rancho
and
hacienda
we
cared
little
as
we
too
were
sufficiently
armed
we
saw
that
the
party
selected
were
men
of
powerful
strength
in
fact
they
were
the
picked
warriors
of
the
tribe
ours
were
similarly
chosen
among
them
were
el
sol
and
garey
rube
and
the
sanchez
seguin
and
i
were
of
the
number
most
of
the
trappers
with
a
few
delaware
indians
completed
the
complement
the
twenty
were
soon
selected
and
stepping
out
on
the
open
ground
as
the
navajoes
had
done
we
piled
our
rifles
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
our
captives
were
then
mounted
and
made
ready
for
starting
the
queen
and
the
mexican
girls
were
brought
forward
among
the
rest
this
last
was
a
piece
of
strategy
on
the
part
of
seguin
he
knew
that
we
had
captives
enough
to
exchange
one
for
one
without
these
but
he
saw
as
we
all
did
that
to
leave
the
queen
behind
would
interrupt
the
negotiation
and
perhaps
put
an
end
to
it
altogether
he
had
resolved
therefore
on
taking
her
along
trusting
that
he
could
better
negotiate
for
her
on
the
ground
failing
this
there
would
be
but
one
appeal
to
arms
and
he
knew
that
our
party
was
well
prepared
for
that
alternative
both
sides
were
at
length
ready
and
at
a
signal
commenced
riding
down
the
barranca
in
the
direction
of
the
mine
the
rest
of
the
two
bands
remained
eyeing
each
other
across
the
gulf
with
glances
of
mistrust
and
hatred
neither
party
could
move
without
the
other
seeing
it
for
the
plains
in
which
they
were
though
on
opposite
sides
of
the
barranca
were
but
segments
of
the
same
horizontal
plateau
a
horseman
proceeding
from
either
party
could
have
been
seen
by
the
others
to
a
distance
of
many
miles
the
flags
of
truce
were
still
waving
their
spears
stuck
into
the
ground
but
each
of
the
hostile
bands
held
their
horses
saddled
and
bridled
ready
to
mount
at
the
first
movement
of
the
other
chapter
forty
five
a
vexed
treaty
within
the
barranca
was
the
mine
the
shafts
rude
diggings
pierced
the
cliffs
on
both
sides
like
so
many
caves
the
bottom
between
the
cliffs
was
bisected
by
a
rivulet
that
murmured
among
loose
rocks
on
the
banks
of
this
rivulet
stood
the
old
and
ruined
ranches
of
the
miners
most
of
them
were
roofless
and
crumbling
to
decay
the
ground
about
them
was
shaggy
and
choked
up
there
were
briars
mezcal
plants
and
cacti
all
luxuriant
hirsute
and
thorny
approaching
this
point
the
road
on
each
side
of
the
barranca
suddenly
dips
the
trails
converging
downward
and
meeting
among
the
ruins
when
in
view
of
these
both
parties
halted
and
signalled
each
other
across
the
ravine
after
a
short
parley
it
was
proposed
by
the
navajoes
that
the
captives
and
horses
should
remain
on
the
top
of
the
hill
each
train
to
be
guarded
by
two
men
the
rest
eighteen
on
each
side
should
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
barranca
meet
among
the
houses
and
having
smoked
the
calumet
arrange
the
terms
of
the
exchange
neither
seguin
nor
i
liked
this
proposal
we
saw
that
in
the
event
of
a
rupture
in
the
negotiation
a
thing
we
more
than
half
anticipated
even
should
our
party
overpower
the
other
we
could
gain
nothing
before
we
could
reach
the
navajo
captives
up
the
steep
hill
the
two
guards
would
hurry
them
off
or
we
dreaded
to
think
of
it
butcher
them
on
the
ground
it
was
a
fearful
thought
but
there
was
nothing
improbable
in
it
we
knew
moreover
that
smoking
the
would
be
another
waste
of
time
and
we
were
on
thorns
about
the
approach
of
dacoma
party
but
the
proposal
had
come
from
the
enemy
and
they
were
obstinate
we
could
urge
no
objections
to
it
without
betraying
our
designs
and
we
were
compelled
though
loth
to
accept
it
we
dismounted
leaving
our
horses
in
charge
of
the
guard
and
descending
into
the
ravine
stood
face
to
face
with
the
warriors
of
navajo
they
were
eighteen
picked
men
tall
and
muscular
the
expression
of
their
faces
was
savage
subtle
and
grim
there
was
not
a
smile
to
be
seen
and
the
lip
that
at
that
moment
had
betrayed
one
would
have
lied
there
was
hate
in
their
hearts
and
vengeance
in
their
looks
for
a
moment
both
parties
stood
scanning
each
other
in
silence
these
were
no
common
foes
it
was
no
common
hostility
that
for
years
had
nerved
them
against
each
other
and
it
was
no
common
cause
that
had
now
for
the
first
time
brought
them
face
to
face
without
arms
in
their
hands
a
mutual
want
had
forced
them
to
their
present
attitude
of
peace
though
it
was
more
like
a
truce
between
the
lion
and
tiger
which
have
met
in
an
avenue
of
the
jungly
forest
and
stand
eyeing
one
another
though
by
agreement
without
arms
both
were
sufficiently
armed
and
they
knew
that
of
each
other
the
handles
of
tomahawks
the
hafts
of
knives
and
the
shining
butts
of
pistols
peeped
carelessly
out
from
the
dresses
both
of
hunters
and
indians
there
was
little
effort
made
to
conceal
these
dangerous
toys
and
they
were
on
all
sides
visible
at
length
our
mutual
reconnaissance
came
to
a
period
and
we
proceeded
to
business
there
happened
to
be
no
breadth
of
ground
clear
of
weeds
and
thorny
rubbish
where
we
could
seat
ourselves
lor
the
smoke
seguin
pointed
to
one
of
the
houses
an
adobe
structure
in
a
tolerable
state
of
preservation
and
several
entered
to
examine
it
the
building
had
been
used
as
a
and
broken
trucks
and
other
implements
were
lying
over
the
floor
there
was
but
one
apartment
not
a
large
one
either
and
near
its
centre
stood
a
brazero
covered
with
cold
slag
and
ashes
two
men
were
appointed
to
kindle
a
fire
upon
the
brazero
and
the
rest
entering
took
their
seats
upon
the
trucks
and
masses
of
quartz
rock
ore
that
lay
around
the
room
as
i
was
about
seating
myself
an
object
leaped
against
me
from
behind
uttering
a
low
whine
that
ended
in
a
bark
i
turned
and
beheld
the
dog
alp
the
animal
frenzied
with
delight
rushed
upon
me
repeatedly
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
quiet
him
and
take
my
place
at
length
we
all
were
seated
upon
opposite
sides
of
the
fire
each
party
forming
the
arc
of
a
circle
concave
to
the
other
there
was
a
heavy
door
still
hanging
upon
its
hinge
and
as
there
were
no
windows
in
the
house
this
was
suffered
to
remain
open
it
opened
to
the
inside
the
fire
was
soon
kindled
and
the
calumet
filled
with
it
was
then
lighted
and
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
in
profound
silence
we
noticed
that
each
of
the
indians
contrary
to
their
usual
custom
of
taking
a
whiff
or
two
smoked
long
and
slowly
we
knew
it
was
a
ruse
to
protract
the
ceremony
and
gain
time
while
we
i
answer
for
seguin
and
myself
were
chafing
at
the
delay
when
the
pipe
came
round
to
the
hunters
it
passed
in
quicker
time
the
unsocial
smoke
was
at
length
ended
and
the
negotiation
began
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
talk
i
saw
that
we
were
going
to
have
a
difficulty
the
navajoes
particularly
the
younger
warriors
assumed
a
bullying
and
exacting
attitude
that
the
hunters
were
not
likely
to
brook
nor
would
they
have
submitted
to
it
for
a
moment
but
for
the
peculiar
position
in
which
their
chief
was
placed
for
his
sake
they
held
in
as
well
as
they
could
but
the
tinder
was
apparent
and
would
not
bear
many
sparks
before
it
blazed
up
the
first
question
was
in
relation
to
the
number
of
the
prisoners
the
enemy
had
nineteen
while
we
without
including
the
queen
or
the
mexican
girls
numbered
this
was
in
our
favour
but
to
our
surprise
the
indians
insisted
that
their
captives
were
grown
women
that
most
of
ours
were
children
and
that
two
of
the
latter
should
be
exchanged
for
one
of
the
former
to
this
absurdity
seguin
replied
that
we
could
not
agree
but
as
he
did
not
wish
to
keep
any
of
their
prisoners
he
would
exchange
the
for
the
nineteen
exclaimed
a
brave
why
you
have
we
counted
them
on
the
bank
six
of
those
you
counted
are
our
own
people
they
are
whites
and
mexicans
six
whites
retorted
the
savage
there
are
but
five
who
is
the
sixth
perhaps
it
is
our
queen
she
is
light
in
colour
perhaps
the
pale
chief
has
mistaken
her
for
a
white
ha
ha
ha
roared
the
savages
in
a
taunting
laugh
our
queen
a
white
ha
ha
ha
your
queen
said
seguin
in
a
solemn
voice
your
queen
as
you
call
her
is
my
daughter
ha
ha
ha
again
howled
they
in
scornful
chorus
your
daughter
ha
ha
ha
and
the
room
rang
with
their
demoniac
laughter
yes
repeated
he
in
a
loud
but
faltering
voice
for
he
now
saw
the
turn
that
things
were
taking
yes
she
is
my
daughter
how
can
that
be
demanded
one
of
the
braves
an
orator
of
the
tribe
you
have
a
daughter
among
our
captives
we
know
that
she
is
white
as
the
snow
upon
the
her
hair
is
yellow
as
the
gold
upon
these
armlets
the
queen
is
dark
in
complexion
among
our
tribes
there
are
many
as
light
as
she
and
her
hair
is
like
the
wing
of
the
black
vulture
how
is
that
our
children
are
like
one
another
are
not
yours
the
same
if
the
queen
be
your
daughter
then
the
maiden
is
not
you
can
not
be
the
father
of
both
but
no
continued
the
subtle
savage
elevating
his
voice
the
queen
is
not
your
daughter
she
is
of
our
race
a
child
of
montezuma
a
queen
of
the
navajoes
the
queen
must
be
returned
to
us
exclaimed
several
braves
she
is
ours
we
must
have
her
in
vain
seguin
reiterated
his
paternal
claim
in
vain
he
detailed
the
time
and
circumstances
of
her
capture
by
the
navajoes
themselves
the
braves
again
cried
out
she
is
our
queen
we
must
have
her
seguin
in
an
eloquent
speech
appealed
to
the
feelings
of
the
old
chief
whose
daughter
was
in
similar
circumstances
but
it
was
evident
that
the
latter
lacked
the
power
if
he
had
the
will
to
stay
the
storm
that
was
rising
the
younger
warriors
answered
with
shouts
of
derision
one
of
them
crying
out
that
the
white
chief
was
raving
they
continued
for
some
time
to
gesticulate
at
intervals
declaring
loudly
that
on
no
terms
would
they
agree
to
an
exchange
unless
the
queen
were
given
up
it
was
evident
that
some
mysterious
tie
bound
them
to
such
extreme
loyalty
even
the
exchange
of
dacoma
was
less
desired
by
them
their
demands
were
urged
in
so
insulting
a
manner
that
we
felt
satisfied
it
was
their
intention
in
the
end
to
bring
us
to
a
fight
the
rifles
so
much
dreaded
by
them
were
absent
and
they
felt
certain
of
obtaining
a
victory
over
us
the
hunters
were
equally
willing
to
be
at
it
and
equally
sure
of
a
conquest
they
only
waited
the
signal
from
their
leader
a
signal
was
given
but
to
their
surprise
and
chagrin
it
was
one
of
peace
seguin
turning
to
them
and
looking
down
for
he
was
upon
his
feet
cautioned
them
in
a
low
voice
to
be
patient
and
silent
then
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hand
he
stood
for
some
moments
in
an
attitude
of
meditation
the
hunters
had
full
confidence
in
the
talents
as
well
as
bravery
of
their
chief
they
knew
that
he
was
devising
some
plan
of
action
and
they
patiently
awaited
the
result
on
the
other
side
the
indians
showed
no
signs
of
impatience
they
cared
not
how
much
time
was
consumed
for
they
hoped
that
by
this
time
dacoma
party
would
be
on
their
trail
they
sat
still
exchanging
their
thoughts
in
grunts
and
short
phrases
while
many
of
them
filled
up
the
intervals
with
laughter
they
felt
quite
easy
and
seemed
not
in
the
least
to
dread
the
alternative
of
a
fight
with
us
indeed
to
look
at
both
parties
one
should
have
said
that
man
to
man
we
would
have
been
no
match
for
them
they
were
all
with
one
or
two
exceptions
men
of
six
feet
most
of
them
over
it
in
height
while
many
of
the
hunters
were
men
but
among
these
there
was
not
one
white
feather
the
navajoes
knew
that
they
themselves
were
well
armed
for
close
conflict
they
knew
too
that
we
were
armed
ha
they
little
dreamt
how
we
were
armed
they
saw
that
the
hunters
carried
knives
and
pistols
but
they
thought
that
after
the
first
volley
uncertain
and
the
knives
would
be
no
match
for
their
terrible
tomahawks
they
knew
not
that
from
the
belts
of
several
of
us
el
sol
seguin
garey
and
myself
hung
a
fearful
weapon
the
most
fearful
of
all
others
in
close
combat
the
colt
revolver
it
was
then
but
a
new
patent
and
no
navajo
had
ever
heard
its
continuous
and
detonations
brothers
said
seguin
again
placing
himself
in
an
attitude
to
speak
you
deny
that
i
am
the
father
of
the
girl
two
of
your
captives
whom
you
know
to
be
my
wife
and
daughter
are
her
mother
and
sister
this
you
deny
if
you
be
sincere
then
you
can
not
object
to
the
proposal
i
am
about
to
make
let
them
be
brought
before
us
let
her
be
brought
if
she
fail
to
recognise
and
acknowledge
her
kindred
then
shall
i
yield
my
claim
and
the
maiden
be
free
to
return
with
the
warriors
of
navajo
the
hunters
heard
this
proposition
with
surprise
they
knew
that
seguin
efforts
to
awaken
any
recollection
of
himself
in
the
mind
of
the
girl
had
been
unsuccessful
what
likelihood
was
there
that
she
would
remember
her
mother
but
seguin
himself
had
little
hope
of
this
and
a
moment
reflection
convinced
us
that
his
proposal
was
based
upon
some
hidden
idea
he
saw
that
the
exchange
of
the
queen
was
a
qua
with
the
indians
and
without
this
being
granted
the
negotiations
would
terminate
abruptly
leaving
his
wife
and
younger
daughter
still
in
the
hands
of
our
enemies
he
reflected
on
the
harsh
lot
which
would
await
them
in
their
captivity
while
she
returned
but
to
receive
homage
and
kindness
they
must
be
saved
at
every
sacrifice
she
must
be
yielded
up
to
redeem
them
but
seguin
had
still
another
design
it
was
a
strategic
manoeuvre
a
desperate
and
on
his
part
it
was
this
he
saw
that
if
he
could
once
get
the
captives
his
wife
and
daughter
down
among
the
houses
there
would
be
a
possibility
in
the
event
of
a
fight
of
carrying
them
off
the
queen
too
might
thus
be
rescued
as
well
it
was
the
alternative
suggested
by
despair
in
a
hurried
whisper
he
communicated
this
to
those
of
his
comrades
nearest
him
in
order
to
insure
their
prudence
and
patience
as
soon
as
the
proposal
was
made
the
navajoes
rose
from
their
seats
and
clustered
together
in
a
corner
of
the
room
to
deliberate
they
spoke
in
low
tones
we
could
not
of
course
understand
what
was
said
but
from
the
expression
of
their
faces
and
their
gesticulations
we
could
tell
that
they
seemed
disposed
to
accept
it
they
knew
that
the
queen
had
not
recognised
seguin
as
her
father
they
had
watched
her
closely
as
she
rode
down
the
opposite
side
of
the
barranca
in
fact
conversed
by
signals
with
her
before
we
could
interfere
to
prevent
it
no
doubt
she
had
informed
them
of
what
happened
at
the
canon
with
dacoma
warriors
and
the
probability
of
their
approach
they
had
little
fear
then
that
she
would
remember
her
mother
her
long
absence
her
age
when
made
captive
her
and
the
more
than
kind
treatment
she
had
received
at
their
hands
had
long
since
blotted
out
every
recollection
of
her
childhood
and
its
associations
the
subtle
savages
well
knew
this
and
at
length
after
a
discussion
which
lasted
for
nearly
an
hour
they
resumed
their
seats
and
signified
their
assent
to
the
proposal
two
men
one
from
each
party
were
now
sent
for
the
three
captives
and
we
sat
waiting
their
arrival
in
a
short
time
they
were
led
in
i
find
a
difficulty
in
describing
the
scene
that
followed
the
meeting
of
seguin
with
his
wife
and
daughter
my
own
short
embrace
and
hurried
kiss
the
sobs
and
swooning
of
my
betrothed
the
mother
recognition
of
her
child
the
anguish
that
ensued
as
her
yearning
heart
made
its
appeals
in
vain
the
looks
of
the
hunters
the
triumphant
gestures
and
ejaculations
of
the
indians
all
formed
points
in
a
picture
that
lives
with
painful
vividness
in
my
memory
though
i
am
not
sufficiently
master
of
the
author
art
to
paint
it
in
a
few
minutes
the
captives
were
led
out
of
the
house
guarded
by
two
men
while
the
rest
of
us
remained
to
complete
the
negotiation
chapter
forty
six
a
conflict
with
closed
doors
the
occurrence
did
not
improve
the
temper
of
either
party
particularly
that
of
the
hunters
the
indians
were
triumphant
but
not
a
whit
the
less
inclined
to
obstinacy
and
exaction
they
now
returned
to
their
former
offer
for
those
of
our
captives
that
were
they
would
exchange
one
for
one
and
for
their
chief
dacoma
they
offered
to
give
two
for
the
rest
they
insisted
on
receiving
two
for
one
by
this
arrangement
we
could
ransom
only
about
twelve
of
the
mexican
women
but
finding
them
determined
seguin
at
length
assented
to
these
terms
provided
they
would
allow
us
the
privilege
of
choosing
the
twelve
to
be
exchanged
to
our
surprise
and
indignation
this
was
refused
we
no
longer
doubted
what
was
to
be
the
winding
up
of
the
negotiation
the
air
was
filled
with
the
electricity
of
anger
hate
kindled
hate
and
vengeance
was
burning
in
every
eye
the
indians
scowled
on
us
glancing
malignantly
out
of
their
oblique
eyes
there
was
triumph
too
in
their
looks
for
they
believed
themselves
far
stronger
than
we
on
the
other
side
sat
the
hunters
quivering
under
a
double
indignation
i
say
double
i
can
hardly
explain
what
i
mean
they
had
never
before
been
so
braved
by
indians
they
had
all
their
lives
been
accustomed
partly
out
of
bravado
and
partly
from
actual
experience
to
consider
the
red
men
their
inferiors
in
subtilty
and
courage
and
to
be
thus
bearded
by
them
filled
the
hunters
as
i
have
said
with
a
double
indignation
it
was
like
the
bitter
anger
which
the
superior
feels
towards
his
resisting
inferior
the
lord
to
his
rebellious
serf
the
master
to
his
lashed
slave
who
has
turned
and
struck
him
it
was
thus
the
hunters
felt
i
glanced
along
their
line
i
never
saw
faces
with
such
expressions
as
i
saw
there
and
then
their
lips
were
white
and
drawn
tightly
over
their
teeth
their
cheeks
were
set
and
colourless
and
their
eyes
protruding
forward
seemed
glued
in
their
sockets
there
was
no
motion
to
be
detected
in
the
features
of
any
save
the
twitching
of
angry
muscles
their
right
hands
were
buried
in
the
bosoms
of
their
shirts
each
i
knew
grasping
a
weapon
and
they
appeared
not
to
sit
but
to
crouch
forward
like
panthers
quivering
upon
the
spring
there
was
a
long
interval
of
silence
on
both
sides
it
was
broken
by
a
cry
from
without
the
scream
of
the
we
should
not
have
noticed
this
knowing
that
these
birds
were
common
in
the
mimbres
and
one
might
have
flown
over
the
ravine
but
we
thought
or
fancied
that
it
had
made
an
impression
upon
our
adversaries
they
were
men
not
apt
to
show
any
sudden
emotion
but
it
appeared
to
us
that
all
at
once
their
glances
grew
bolder
and
more
triumphant
could
it
have
been
a
signal
we
listened
for
a
minute
the
scream
was
repeated
and
although
it
was
exactly
after
the
manner
of
a
bird
well
known
to
us
the
eagle
we
sat
with
unsatisfied
and
tearful
apprehensions
the
young
chief
he
in
the
hussar
dress
was
upon
his
feet
he
had
been
the
most
turbulent
and
exacting
of
our
opponents
he
was
a
man
of
most
villainous
and
licentious
character
so
rube
had
told
us
but
nevertheless
holding
great
power
among
the
braves
it
was
he
who
had
spoken
in
refusal
of
seguin
offer
and
he
was
now
about
to
assign
his
reasons
we
knew
them
without
that
why
said
he
looking
at
seguin
as
he
spoke
why
is
it
that
the
white
chief
is
so
desirous
of
choosing
among
our
captives
is
it
that
he
wishes
to
get
back
the
maiden
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
for
a
reply
but
seguin
made
none
if
the
white
chief
believes
our
queen
to
be
his
daughter
would
not
he
wish
that
her
sister
should
be
her
companion
and
return
with
her
to
our
land
again
he
paused
but
as
before
seguin
remained
silent
the
speaker
proceeded
why
not
let
the
maiden
return
with
us
and
become
my
wife
who
am
i
that
ask
this
a
chief
of
the
navajoes
the
descendants
of
the
great
montezuma
the
son
of
their
king
the
savage
looked
around
him
with
a
vaunting
air
as
he
uttered
these
words
who
is
she
he
continued
that
i
am
thus
begging
for
a
bride
the
daughter
of
one
who
is
not
even
respected
among
his
own
people
the
daughter
of
a
culatta
i
looked
at
seguin
i
saw
his
form
dilating
i
saw
the
big
veins
swelling
along
his
throat
i
saw
gathering
in
his
eyes
that
wild
expression
i
had
once
before
noticed
i
knew
that
the
crisis
was
near
again
the
eagle
screamed
but
proceeded
the
savage
seeming
to
draw
new
boldness
from
the
signal
i
shall
beg
no
more
i
love
the
white
maiden
she
must
be
mine
and
this
very
night
shall
she
sleep
he
never
finished
the
sentence
seguin
bullet
had
sped
piercing
the
centre
of
his
forehead
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
red
round
hole
with
its
circle
of
blue
powder
as
the
victim
tell
forward
on
his
face
all
together
we
sprang
to
our
feet
as
one
man
rose
hunters
and
indians
as
if
from
one
throat
pealed
the
double
shout
of
defiance
and
as
if
by
one
hand
knives
pistols
and
tomahawks
were
drawn
together
the
next
moment
we
closed
and
battled
oh
it
was
a
fearful
strife
as
the
pistols
cracked
the
long
knives
glittered
and
the
tomahawks
swept
the
air
a
fearful
fearful
strife
you
would
suppose
that
the
first
shock
would
have
prostrated
both
ranks
it
was
not
so
the
early
blows
of
a
struggle
like
this
are
wild
and
well
parried
and
human
life
is
hard
to
take
what
were
the
lives
of
men
like
these
a
few
fell
some
recoiled
from
the
collision
wounded
and
bleeding
but
still
to
battle
again
some
fought
hand
to
hand
while
several
pairs
had
clutched
and
were
striving
to
fling
each
other
in
the
desperate
wrestle
of
death
some
rushed
for
the
door
intending
to
fight
outside
a
few
got
out
but
the
crowd
pressed
against
it
the
door
closed
dead
bodies
fell
behind
it
we
fought
in
darkness
we
had
light
enough
for
our
purpose
the
pistols
flashed
at
quick
intervals
displaying
the
horrid
picture
the
light
gleamed
upon
faces
upon
red
and
waving
weapons
upon
prostrate
forms
of
men
upon
others
struggling
in
every
attitude
of
deadly
conflict
the
yells
of
the
indians
and
the
not
less
savage
shouts
of
their
white
foemen
had
continued
from
the
first
but
the
voices
grew
hoarser
and
the
shouts
were
changed
to
groans
and
oaths
and
short
earnest
exclamations
at
intervals
were
heard
the
quick
percussions
of
blows
and
the
dull
sodden
sound
of
falling
bodies
the
room
became
filled
with
smoke
and
dust
and
choking
sulphur
and
the
combatants
were
as
they
fought
at
the
first
break
of
the
battle
i
had
drawn
my
revolver
and
fired
it
in
the
face
of
the
closing
foemen
i
had
fired
shot
after
shot
some
at
random
others
directed
upon
a
victim
i
had
not
counted
the
reports
until
the
cock
checking
on
the
steel
nipple
told
me
i
had
gone
the
round
of
the
six
chambers
this
had
occupied
but
as
many
seconds
of
time
mechanically
i
stuck
the
empty
weapon
behind
my
belt
and
guided
by
an
impulse
made
for
the
door
before
i
could
reach
it
it
was
closed
and
i
saw
that
to
get
out
was
impossible
i
turned
to
search
for
an
antagonist
i
was
not
long
in
finding
one
by
the
flash
of
a
pistol
i
saw
one
of
the
indians
rushing
upon
me
with
upraised
hatchet
up
to
this
time
something
had
hindered
me
from
drawing
my
knife
i
was
now
too
late
and
holding
out
my
arms
to
catch
the
blow
i
ducked
my
head
towards
the
savage
i
felt
the
keen
blade
cutting
the
flesh
as
it
glanced
along
my
shoulder
i
was
but
slightly
wounded
he
had
missed
his
aim
from
my
stooping
so
suddenly
but
the
impetus
brought
our
bodies
together
and
the
next
moment
we
grappled
we
stumbled
over
a
heap
of
rock
and
for
some
moments
struggled
together
upon
the
ground
neither
able
to
use
his
weapon
again
we
rose
still
locked
in
the
angry
embrace
again
we
were
falling
with
terrible
force
something
caught
us
in
our
descent
it
shook
it
gave
way
with
a
crashing
sound
and
we
fell
headlong
into
the
broad
and
brilliant
light
i
was
dazzled
and
blinded
i
heard
behind
me
a
strange
rumbling
like
the
noise
made
by
falling
timbers
but
i
heeded
not
that
i
was
too
busy
to
speculate
upon
causes
the
sudden
shock
had
separated
us
and
both
rose
at
the
same
instant
again
to
grapple
and
again
to
come
together
to
the
earth
we
twisted
and
wriggled
over
the
ground
among
weeds
and
thorny
cacti
i
was
every
moment
growing
weaker
while
the
sinewy
savage
used
to
such
combats
seemed
to
be
gaining
fresh
nerve
and
breath
thrice
he
had
thrown
me
under
but
each
time
i
had
clutched
his
right
arm
and
prevented
the
descending
blow
i
had
succeeded
in
drawing
my
knife
as
we
fell
through
the
wall
but
my
arm
was
also
held
fast
and
i
was
unable
to
use
it
as
we
came
to
the
ground
for
the
fourth
time
my
antagonist
fell
under
me
a
cry
of
agony
passed
from
his
lips
his
head
coggled
over
among
the
weeds
and
he
lay
in
my
arms
without
struggling
i
felt
his
grasp
gradually
relaxing
i
looked
in
his
face
his
eyes
were
glassy
and
upturned
blood
was
gurgling
through
his
teeth
i
saw
that
he
was
dead
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
this
for
i
knew
i
had
not
struck
him
as
yet
i
was
drawing
my
arm
from
under
him
to
do
so
when
i
noticed
that
he
ceased
to
resist
but
the
knife
now
caught
my
eye
it
was
red
blade
and
haft
and
so
was
the
hand
that
clasped
it
as
we
fell
i
had
accidentally
held
it
point
upward
my
antagonist
had
fallen
upon
the
blade
i
now
thought
of
my
betrothed
and
untwining
myself
from
the
lithe
and
nerveless
limbs
of
the
savage
i
rose
to
my
feet
the
ranche
was
in
flames
the
roof
had
fallen
in
upon
the
brazero
and
the
dry
shingles
had
caught
the
blaze
men
were
crawling
out
from
the
burning
ruin
but
not
to
run
away
no
under
its
lurking
flames
amidst
the
hot
smoke
they
still
battled
fierce
and
foaming
and
frenzied
i
did
not
stay
to
recognise
whom
they
were
these
tireless
combatants
i
ran
forward
looking
on
all
sides
for
the
objects
of
my
solicitude
the
wave
of
female
dresses
caught
my
eye
far
up
the
cliff
on
the
road
leading
to
the
navajo
captives
it
was
they
the
three
were
climbing
the
steep
path
each
urged
onward
by
a
savage
my
first
impulse
was
to
rush
after
but
at
that
moment
fifty
horsemen
made
their
appearance
upon
the
hill
and
came
galloping
downward
i
saw
the
madness
of
attempting
to
follow
them
and
turned
to
retreat
towards
the
other
side
where
we
had
left
our
captives
and
horses
as
i
ran
across
the
bottom
shots
rang
in
my
ear
proceeding
from
our
side
of
the
barranca
looking
up
i
descried
the
mounted
hunters
coming
down
at
a
gallop
pursued
by
a
cloud
of
savage
horsemen
it
was
the
band
of
dacoma
uncertain
what
to
do
i
stood
for
a
moment
where
i
was
and
watched
the
pursuit
the
hunters
on
reaching
the
ranches
did
not
halt
but
galloped
on
down
the
valley
firing
as
they
went
a
body
of
indians
swept
on
after
them
while
another
body
pulled
up
clustered
around
the
blazing
ruin
and
commenced
searching
among
the
walls
i
was
yet
screened
in
the
thicket
of
cacti
but
i
saw
that
my
would
soon
be
pierced
by
the
eyes
of
the
subtle
savages
and
dropping
upon
my
hands
and
knees
i
crept
into
the
cliff
on
reaching
it
i
found
myself
close
to
the
mouth
of
a
cave
a
small
shaft
of
the
mine
and
into
this
i
at
once
betook
myself
chapter
forty
seven
a
queer
encounter
in
a
cave
the
place
into
which
i
had
crawled
was
of
irregular
outlines
rocks
jutted
along
the
sides
and
between
these
small
lateral
shafts
had
been
dug
where
the
miners
had
followed
the
ramifications
of
the
quixa
the
cave
was
not
a
deep
one
the
vein
had
not
proved
profitable
and
had
been
abandoned
for
some
other
i
kept
up
it
till
i
was
fairly
in
the
dark
and
then
groping
against
one
side
i
found
a
recess
in
which
i
ensconced
myself
by
peeping
round
the
rock
i
could
see
out
of
the
cave
and
some
distance
over
the
bottom
of
the
barranca
where
the
bushes
grew
thin
and
straggling
i
had
hardly
seated
myself
when
my
attention
was
called
to
a
scene
that
was
passing
outside
two
men
on
their
hands
and
knees
were
crawling
through
the
cactus
plants
in
front
of
the
cave
beyond
them
half
a
dozen
savages
on
horseback
were
beating
the
thicket
but
had
not
yet
seen
the
men
these
i
recognised
easily
they
were
gode
and
the
doctor
the
latter
was
nearer
me
and
as
he
scrambled
on
over
the
shingle
something
started
out
of
the
rocks
within
reach
of
his
hand
i
noticed
that
it
was
a
small
animal
of
the
armadillo
kind
i
saw
him
stretch
forward
clutch
it
and
with
a
pleased
look
deposit
it
in
a
bag
that
was
by
his
side
all
this
time
the
indians
were
whooping
and
yelling
behind
him
and
not
fifty
yards
distant
doubtless
the
animal
was
of
some
new
species
but
the
zealous
naturalist
never
gave
it
to
the
world
he
had
scarcely
drawn
forth
his
hand
again
when
a
cry
from
the
savages
announced
that
he
and
gode
were
discovered
and
the
next
moment
both
lay
upon
the
ground
pierced
with
lances
and
to
all
appearance
dead
their
pursuers
now
dismounted
with
the
intention
of
scalping
them
poor
reichter
his
cap
was
pulled
off
the
bleeding
trophy
followed
and
he
lay
with
the
red
skull
towards
the
cave
a
hideous
spectacle
another
indian
had
alighted
and
stood
over
the
canadian
with
his
long
knife
in
his
hand
although
pitying
my
poor
follower
and
altogether
in
no
humour
for
mirth
knowing
what
i
did
i
could
not
help
watching
the
proceedings
with
some
curiosity
the
savage
stood
for
a
moment
admiring
the
beautiful
curls
that
embellished
the
head
of
his
victim
he
was
no
doubt
thinking
what
handsome
fringes
they
would
make
for
his
leggings
he
appeared
to
be
in
ecstasies
of
delight
and
from
the
flourishes
which
he
made
with
his
knife
i
could
see
that
it
was
his
intention
to
skin
the
whole
head
after
cutting
several
capers
around
it
he
stooped
and
grasped
a
fistful
of
curls
but
before
he
had
touched
the
scalp
with
his
blade
the
hair
lifted
off
displaying
the
white
and
skull
with
a
cry
of
terror
the
savage
dropped
the
wig
and
running
backward
fell
over
the
body
of
the
doctor
the
cry
attracted
his
comrades
and
several
of
them
dismounting
approached
the
strange
object
with
looks
of
astonishment
one
more
courageous
than
the
rest
picked
up
the
wig
which
they
all
proceeded
to
examine
with
curious
minuteness
then
one
after
another
went
up
to
the
shining
skull
and
passed
his
fingers
over
its
smooth
surface
all
the
while
uttering
exclamations
of
surprise
they
tried
on
the
wig
took
it
off
and
put
it
on
again
turning
it
in
various
ways
at
length
he
who
claimed
it
as
his
property
pulled
off
his
plumed
and
adjusting
the
wig
upon
his
own
head
front
backward
stalked
proudly
around
with
the
long
curls
dangling
over
his
face
it
was
altogether
a
curious
scene
and
under
other
circumstances
might
have
amused
me
there
was
something
irresistibly
comic
in
the
puzzled
looks
of
the
actors
but
i
had
been
too
deeply
affected
by
the
tragedy
to
laugh
at
the
farce
there
was
too
much
of
horror
around
me
seguin
perhaps
dead
she
gone
for
ever
the
slave
of
the
brutal
savage
my
own
peril
too
at
the
moment
for
i
knew
not
how
soon
i
might
be
discovered
and
dragged
forth
this
affected
me
least
of
all
my
life
was
now
of
little
value
to
me
and
so
i
regarded
it
but
there
is
an
instinct
of
even
when
the
will
ceases
to
act
hopes
soon
began
to
shape
themselves
in
my
mind
and
along
with
these
the
wish
to
live
thoughts
came
i
might
organise
a
powerful
band
i
might
yet
rescue
her
yes
even
though
years
might
intervene
i
would
accomplish
this
she
would
still
be
true
she
would
never
forget
poor
seguin
what
a
life
of
hope
withered
in
an
hour
he
himself
sealing
the
sacrifice
with
his
blood
but
i
would
not
despair
even
with
his
fate
for
a
warning
i
would
take
up
the
drama
where
he
had
ended
the
curtain
should
rise
upon
new
scenes
and
i
would
not
abandon
the
stage
until
i
had
accomplished
a
more
joyous
finale
or
failing
this
had
reached
the
denouement
of
death
or
vengeance
poor
seguin
no
wonder
he
had
been
a
i
could
now
understand
how
holy
was
his
hate
for
the
ruthless
red
man
i
too
had
imbibed
the
passion
with
such
reflections
passing
hastily
for
the
scene
i
have
described
and
the
sequent
thoughts
did
not
occupy
much
time
i
turned
my
eyes
inwards
to
examine
whether
i
was
sufficiently
concealed
in
my
niche
they
might
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
the
shaft
as
i
endeavoured
to
penetrate
the
gloom
that
extended
inwards
my
gaze
became
riveted
on
an
object
that
caused
me
to
shrink
back
with
a
cold
shudder
notwithstanding
the
scenes
i
had
just
passed
through
this
was
the
cause
of
still
another
agony
in
the
thick
of
the
darkness
i
could
distinguish
two
small
spots
round
and
shining
they
did
not
scintillate
but
rather
glistened
with
a
steady
greenish
lustre
i
knew
that
they
were
eyes
i
was
in
the
cave
with
a
panther
or
with
a
still
more
terrible
companion
the
grizzly
bear
my
first
impulse
was
to
press
back
into
the
recess
where
i
had
hidden
myself
this
i
did
until
my
back
leaned
against
the
rocks
i
had
no
thoughts
of
attempting
to
escape
out
that
would
have
been
from
the
into
the
fire
for
the
indians
were
still
in
front
of
the
cave
moreover
any
attempt
to
retreat
would
only
draw
on
the
animal
perhaps
at
that
moment
straining
to
spring
i
cowered
closely
groping
along
my
belt
for
the
handle
of
my
knife
i
clasped
this
at
length
and
drawing
it
forth
waited
in
a
crouching
attitude
during
all
this
time
my
eyes
had
remained
fixed
on
the
lustrous
orbs
before
me
i
saw
that
they
were
fixed
upon
mine
and
watched
me
without
as
much
as
winking
mine
seemed
to
be
possessed
of
abstract
volition
i
could
not
take
them
off
they
were
held
by
some
terrible
fascination
and
i
felt
or
fancied
that
the
moment
this
should
be
broken
the
animal
would
spring
upon
me
i
had
heard
of
fierce
brutes
being
conquered
by
the
glance
of
the
human
eye
and
i
endeavoured
to
look
back
my
with
interest
we
sat
for
some
time
neither
of
us
moving
an
inch
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
animal
body
nothing
but
the
green
gleaming
circles
that
seemed
set
in
a
ground
of
ebony
as
they
had
remained
motionless
so
long
i
conjectured
that
the
owner
of
them
was
still
lying
in
his
lair
and
would
not
make
his
attack
until
something
disturbed
him
perhaps
until
the
indians
had
gone
away
the
thought
now
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
better
arm
myself
i
knew
that
a
knife
would
be
of
little
avail
against
a
grizzly
bear
my
pistol
was
still
in
my
belt
but
it
was
empty
would
the
animal
permit
me
to
load
it
i
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
still
leaving
my
eyes
to
fulfil
their
office
i
felt
for
my
flask
and
pistol
and
finding
both
ready
i
commenced
loading
i
proceeded
with
silence
and
caution
for
i
knew
that
these
animals
could
see
in
the
dark
and
that
in
this
respect
my
had
the
advantage
of
me
i
felt
the
powder
in
with
my
finger
and
pushing
the
ball
on
top
of
it
rolled
the
cylinder
to
the
right
notch
and
cocked
as
the
spring
clicked
i
saw
the
eyes
start
it
will
be
on
me
now
quick
as
the
thought
i
placed
my
finger
to
the
trigger
but
before
i
could
level
a
voice
with
a
accent
restrained
me
hold
on
thur
cried
the
voice
why
did
say
yur
hide
wur
white
i
thought
some
sneaking
injun
who
are
anyhow

surprise

no

it
continued
the
voice
with
a
fierce
emphasis
this
comes
layin
one

been

cuss
the

and
the
last
words
were
uttered
with
an
angry
hiss
that
echoed
through
every
part
of
the
cave
yur
the
young
fellur
the
friend
ai
inquired
the
speaker
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
yes
i
replied
i

i
got
a

he
he

and
the
old
trapper
chuckled
at
the
conceit
as
if
he
had
just
been
witnessing
some
scene
of
amusement
and
there
was
not
an
enemy
within
a
hundred
miles
of
him
did
you
see
anything
of
seguin
i
asked
wishing

chapter
forty
eight
smoked
out
our
conversation
had
been
carried
on
in
a
low
tone
for
the
indians
still
remained
in
front
of
the
cave
many
others
had
arrived
and
were
examining
the
skull
of
the
canadian
with
the
same
looks
of
curiosity
and
wonderment
that
had
been
exhibited
by
their
comrades
rube
and
i
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
watching
them
the
trapper
had
flitted
near
me
so
that
he
could
see
out
and
talk
in
whispers
i
was
still
apprehensive
that
the
savages
might
search
the
cave
likely
said
my
companion
they
mout
ef
thur
had
been
so
many
o
these
diggins
do
see
thur
a
grist
o
a
hundred
on

o
the
men
who
got
clur

down

my
notion
the
injuns
seed
that
an
wo
disturb
ef
thur
ai
that
dog
i
well
understood
the
meaning
of
the
emphasis
with
which
these
last
words
were
repeated
my
eyes
simultaneously
with
those
of
the
speaker
had
fallen
upon
the
dog
alp
he
was
running
about
in
front
of
the
cave
i
saw
at
a
glance
he
was
searching
for
me
the
next
moment
he
had
struck
the
trail
where
i
had
crawled
through
the
cacti
and
came
running
down
in
the
direction
of
the
cave
on
reaching
the
body
of
the
canadian
which
lay
directly
in
his
track
he
stopped
for
a
moment
and
appeared
to
examine
it
then
uttering
a
short
yelp
he
passed
on
to
that
of
the
doctor
where
he
made
a
similar
demonstration
he
ran
several
times
from
one
to
the
other
but
at
length
left
them
and
with
his
nose
once
more
to
the
ground
disappeared
out
of
our
view
his
strange
actions
had
attracted
the
attention
of
the
savages
who
one
and
all
stood
watching
him
my
companion
and
i
were
beginning
to
hope
that
he
had
lost
me
when
to
our
dismay
he
appeared
a
second
time
coming
down
the
trail
as
before
this
time
he
leaped
over
the
bodies
and
the
next
moment
sprang
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
a
yell
from
without
told
us
that
we
were
lost
we
endeavoured
to
drive
the
dog
out
again
and
succeeded
rube
having
wounded
him
with
his
knife
but
the
wound
itself
and
the
behaviour
of
the
animal
outside
convinced
our
enemies
that
someone
was
within
the
shaft
in
a
few
seconds
the
entrance
was
darkened
by
a
crowd
of
savages
shouting
and
yelling
now
show
yur
shootin
young
fellur
said
my
companion
it

new
kind

to
the
shanty
quick
wi
yur
slap
in
the
fodder
without
waiting
to
reply
i
caught
hold
of
my
flask
and
loaded
the
remaining
five
chambers
of
the
revolver
i
had
scarcely
finished
when
one
of
the
indians
appeared
in
front
with
a
flaming
brand
and
was
about
stooping
into
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
now
yur
time
cried
rube
fetch
the
niggur
out
o
his
boots
fetch
him
i
fired
and
the
savage
dropping
the
torch
fell
dead
upon
the
top
of
it
an
angry
yell
from
without
followed
the
report
and
the
indians
disappeared
from
the
front
shortly
after
an
arm
was
seen
reaching
in
and
the
dead
body
was
drawn
back
out
of
the
entrance
what
will
they
do
next
think
you
i
inquired
of
my

young
fellur
thur
plenty
o

they
knows
what
you
got
thur
during
all
this
dialogue
none
of
the
indians
made
their
appearance
but
we
could
hear
them
on
both
sides
of
the
shaft
without
we
knew
they
were
deliberating
on
what
plan
they
would
take
to
get
at
us
as
rube
suggested
they
seemed
to
be
aware
that
the
shot
had
come
from
a
revolver
doubtless
some
of
the
survivors
of
the
late
fight
had
informed
them
of
the
fearful
havoc
that
had
been
made
among
them
with
our
pistols
and
they
dreaded
to
face
them
what
other
plan
would
they
adopt
starve
us
out
they

said
rube
in
answer
to
my
question

the
speaker
with
emphasis
i
thort
so
thur
to
smoke
us
look
yander
i
looked
forth
at
a
distance
i
saw
several
indians
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
cave
carrying
large
bundles
of
brushwood
their
intention
was
evident
but
can
they
do
this
i
inquired
doubting
the
possibility
of
our
enemies
being
able
to
effect
their
purpose
in
that
way
can
we
not

neverthemless
an
mind
young
fellur

our
only
chance

i
promised
to
follow
the
directions
that
my
companion
had
given
me
they
wo
get
old
rube
scalp
yit
they
wo
he
he
he
i
turned
towards
him
the
man
was
actually
laughing
at
this
wild
and
jest
it
was
awful
to
hear
him
several
armfuls
of
brush
were
now
thrown
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
i
saw
that
it
was
the
creosote
plant
the
ideodondo
it
was
thrown
upon
the
still
blazing
torch
and
soon
caught
sending
up
a
thick
black
smoke
more
was
piled
on
and
the
fetid
vapour
impelled
by
some
influence
from
without
began
to
reach
our
nostrils
and
lungs
causing
an
almost
instantaneous
feeling
of
sickness
and
suffocation
i
could
not
have
borne
it
long
i
did
not
stay
to
try
how
long
for
at
that
moment
i
heard
rube
crying
out
now
your
time
young
fellur
out
and
gi
them
fits
with
a
feeling
of
desperate
resolve
i
clutched
my
pistol
and
dashed
through
the
smoking
brushwood
i
heard
a
wild
and
deafening
shout
i
saw
a
crowd
of
men
of
fiends
i
saw
spears
and
tomahawks
and
red
knives
raised
and
chapter
forty
nine
a
novel
mode
of
equitation
when
consciousness
returned
i
found
that
i
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
my
dog
the
innocent
cause
of
my
captivity
was
licking
my
face
i
could
not
have
been
long
senseless
for
the
savages
were
still
gesticulating
violently
around
me
one
was
waving
them
back
i
recognised
him
it
was
dacoma
the
chief
uttered
a
short
harangue
that
seemed
to
quiet
the
warriors
i
could
not
tell
what
he
said
but
i
heard
him
use
frequently
the
word
quetzalcoatl
i
knew
that
this
was
the
name
of
their
god
but
i
did
not
understand
at
the
time
what
the
saving
of
my
life
could
have
to
do
with
him
i
thought
that
dacoma
was
protecting
me
from
some
feeling
of
pity
or
gratitude
and
i
endeavoured
to
recollect
whether
i
had
shown
him
any
special
act
of
kindness
during
his
captivity
i
had
sadly
mistaken
the
motives
of
that
splendid
savage
my
head
felt
sore
had
they
scalped
me
with
the
thought
i
raised
my
hand
passing
it
over
my
crown
no
my
favourite
brown
curls
were
still
there
but
there
was
a
deep
cut
along
the
back
of
my
head
the
dent
of
a
tomahawk
i
had
been
struck
from
behind
as
i
came
out
and
before
i
could
fire
a
single
bullet
where
was
rube
i
raised
myself
a
little
and
looked
around
he
was
not
to
be
seen
anywhere
had
he
escaped
as
he
intended
no
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
man
with
only
a
knife
to
have
fought
his
way
through
so
many
moreover
i
did
not
observe
any
commotion
among
the
savages
as
if
an
enemy
had
escaped
them
none
seemed
to
have
gone
off
from
the
spot
what
then
had
ha
i
now
understood
in
its
proper
sense
jest
about
his
scalp
it
was
not
a
but
a
of
triple
ambiguity
the
trapper
instead
of
following
me
had
remained
quietly
in
his
den
where
no
doubt
he
was
at
that
moment
watching
me
his
scapegoat
and
chuckling
at
his
own
escape
the
indians
never
dreaming
that
there
were
two
of
us
in
the
cave
and
satisfied
that
it
was
now
empty
made
no
further
attempts
to
smoke
it
i
was
not
likely
to
undeceive
them
i
knew
that
rube
death
or
capture
could
not
have
benefited
me
but
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
strange
stratagem
by
which
the
old
fox
had
saved
himself
i
was
not
allowed
much
time
for
reflection
two
of
the
savages
seizing
me
by
the
arms
dragged
me
up
to
the
still
blazing
ruin
on
heavens
was
it
for
this
dacoma
had
saved
me
from
their
tomahawks
for
this
the
most
cruel
of
deaths
they
proceeded
to
tie
me
hand
and
foot
several
others
were
around
submitting
to
the
same
treatment
i
recognised
sanchez
the
and
the
irishman
there
were
three
others
of
the
band
whose
names
i
had
never
learnt
we
were
in
an
open
space
in
front
of
the
burning
ranche
we
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
the
indians
were
clearing
it
of
the
fallen
and
charred
timbers
to
get
at
the
bodies
of
their
friends
i
watched
their
proceeding
with
less
interest
as
i
now
knew
that
seguin
was
not
there
it
was
a
horrid
spectacle
when
the
rubbish
was
cleared
away
laying
bare
the
floor
of
the
ruin
more
than
a
dozen
bodies
lay
upon
it
their
dresses
were
burned
off
but
by
the
parts
that
remained
still
intact
from
the
fire
we
could
easily
recognise
to
what
party
each
had
belonged
the
greater
number
of
them
were
navajoes
there
were
also
the
bodies
of
hunters
smoking
inside
their
cindery
shirts
i
thought
of
garey
but
as
far
as
i
could
judge
he
was
not
among
them
there
were
no
scalps
for
the
indians
to
take
the
fire
had
been
before
them
and
had
not
left
a
hair
upon
the
heads
of
their
dead
foemen
seemingly
mortified
at
this
they
lifted
the
bodies
of
the
hunters
and
tossed
them
once
more
into
the
flames
that
were
still
blazing
up
from
the
piled
rafters
they
gathered
the
knives
pistols
and
tomahawks
that
lay
among
the
ashes
and
carrying
what
remained
of
their
own
people
out
of
the
ruin
placed
them
in
front
they
then
stood
around
them
in
a
circle
and
with
loud
voices
chanted
a
chorus
of
vengeance
during
all
this
proceeding
we
lay
where
we
had
been
thrown
guarded
by
a
dozen
savages
we
were
filled
with
fearful
apprehensions
we
saw
the
fire
still
blazing
and
we
saw
that
the
bodies
of
our
late
comrades
had
been
thrown
upon
it
we
dreaded
a
similar
fate
for
our
own
but
we
soon
found
that
we
were
reserved
for
some
other
purpose
six
mules
were
brought
up
and
upon
these
we
were
mounted
in
a
novel
fashion
we
were
first
set
astride
on
the
bare
backs
with
our
faces
turned
tailwards
our
feet
were
then
drawn
under
the
necks
of
the
animals
where
our
ankles
were
closely
corded
together
we
were
next
compelled
to
bend
down
our
bodies
until
we
lay
along
the
backs
of
the
mules
our
chins
resting
on
their
rumps
in
this
position
our
arms
were
drawn
down
until
our
hands
met
underneath
where
they
were
tied
tightly
by
the
wrists
the
attitude
was
painful
and
to
add
to
this
our
mules
not
used
to
be
thus
packed
kicked
and
plunged
over
the
ground
to
the
great
mirth
of
our
captors
this
cruel
sport
was
kept
up
even
after
the
mules
themselves
had
got
tired
of
it
by
the
savages
pricking
the
animals
with
their
spears
and
placing
branches
of
the
cactus
under
their
tails
we
were
fainting
when
it
ended
our
captors
now
divided
themselves
into
two
parties
and
started
up
the
barranca
taking
opposite
sides
one
went
with
the
mexican
captives
and
the
girls
and
children
of
the
tribe
the
larger
party
under
dacoma
now
head
chief
for
the
other
had
been
killed
in
the
conflict
guarded
us
we
were
carried
up
that
side
on
which
was
the
spring
and
arriving
at
the
water
were
halted
for
the
night
we
were
taken
off
the
mules
and
securely
tied
to
one
another
our
guard
watching
us
without
intermission
till
morning
we
were
then
packed
as
before
and
carried
westward
across
the
desert
chapter
fifty
a
fast
dye
after
a
four
days
journey
painful
even
to
be
remembered
we
the
valley
of
navajoa
the
other
captives
along
with
the
great
caballada
had
arrived
before
us
and
we
saw
the
plundered
cattle
scattered
over
the
plain
as
we
approached
the
town
we
were
met
by
crowds
of
women
and
children
far
more
than
we
had
seen
on
our
former
visit
these
were
guests
who
had
come
in
from
other
villages
of
the
navajoes
that
lay
farther
to
the
north
they
were
there
to
witness
the
triumphant
return
of
the
warriors
and
partake
of
the
great
feast
that
always
follows
a
successful
foray
i
noticed
many
white
faces
among
them
with
features
of
the
iberian
race
they
had
been
captives
they
were
now
the
wives
of
warriors
they
were
dressed
like
the
others
and
seemed
to
participate
in
the
general
joy
they
like
seguin
daughter
had
been
indianised
there
were
many
mestizoes
the
descendants
of
indians
and
their
mexican
captives
the
offspring
of
many
a
sabine
wedding
we
were
carried
through
the
streets
and
out
to
the
western
side
of
the
village
the
crowd
followed
us
with
mingled
exclamations
of
triumph
hatred
and
curiosity
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
houses
and
close
to
the
river
bank
our
guards
drew
up
i
had
turned
my
eyes
on
all
sides
as
we
passed
through
as
well
as
my
awkward
position
would
permit
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
or
any
of
the
female
captives
where
could
they
be
perhaps
in
the
temple
this
building
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
town
and
the
houses
prevented
me
from
seeing
it
its
top
only
was
visible
from
the
spot
where
we
had
been
halted
we
were
untied
and
taken
down
we
were
happy
at
being
relieved
from
the
painful
attitude
in
which
we
had
ridden
all
the
way
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
we
should
now
be
allowed
to
sit
upright
our
was
brief
we
soon
found
that
the
change
was
from
the
into
the
fire
we
were
only
to
be
turned
we
had
hitherto
lain
upon
our
bellies
we
were
now
to
be
laid
upon
our
backs
in
a
few
moments
the
change
was
accomplished
our
captors
handling
us
as
unceremoniously
as
though
we
had
been
inanimate
things
indeed
we
were
nearly
so
we
were
spread
upon
the
green
turf
on
our
backs
around
each
man
four
long
pins
were
driven
into
the
ground
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
our
arms
and
legs
were
stretched
out
to
their
widest
and
thongs
were
looped
about
our
wrists
and
ankles
these
were
passed
over
the
pins
and
drawn
so
tightly
that
our
joints
cracked
with
the
cruel
tension
thus
we
lay
faces
upturned
like
so
many
hides
spread
out
to
be
we
were
placed
in
two
ranks
endways
in
such
a
manner
that
the
heads
of
the
men
rested
between
the
feet
of
their
respective
rears
as
there
were
six
of
us
in
all
we
formed
three
files
with
short
intervals
between
our
attitudes
and
fastenings
left
us
without
the
power
of
moving
a
limb
the
only
member
over
which
we
had
any
control
was
the
head
and
this
thanks
to
the
flexibility
of
our
necks
we
could
turn
about
so
as
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
front
or
on
either
side
of
us
as
soon
as
we
were
fairly
staked
down
i
had
the
curiosity
to
raise
my
head
and
look
around
me
i
found
that
i
was
rear
rank
right
file
and
that
my
file
leader
was
the
soldier
the
indian
guards
after
having
stripped
us
of
most
of
our
clothing
left
us
and
the
girls
and
squaws
now
began
to
crowd
around
i
noticed
that
they
were
gathering
in
front
of
my
position
and
forming
a
dense
circle
around
the
irishman
i
was
struck
with
their
ludicrous
gestures
their
strange
exclamations
and
the
puzzled
expression
of
their
countenances
ta
yah
ta
yah
cried
they
and
the
whole
crowd
burst
into
shrill
screams
of
laughter
what
could
it
mean
barney
was
evidently
the
subject
of
their
mirth
but
what
was
there
about
him
to
cause
it
more
than
about
any
of
the
rest
of
us
i
raised
my
head
to
ascertain
the
riddle
was
solved
at
once
one
of
the
indians
in
going
off
had
taken
the
irishman
cap
with
him
and
the
little
round
red
head
was
exposed
to
view
it
lay
midway
between
my
feet
like
a
luminous
ball
and
i
saw
that
it
was
the
object
of
diversion
by
degrees
the
squaws
drew
nearer
until
they
were
huddled
up
in
a
thick
crowd
around
the
body
of
our
comrade
at
length
one
of
them
stooped
and
touched
the
head
drawing
back
her
fingers
with
a
start
and
a
gesture
as
though
she
had
burned
them
this
elicited
fresh
peals
of
laughter
and
very
soon
all
the
women
of
the
village
were
around
the
irishman
scroodging
one
another
to
get
a
closer
view
none
of
the
rest
of
us
were
heeded
except
to
be
liberally
trampled
upon
and
half
a
dozen
big
heavy
squaws
were
standing
upon
my
limbs
the
better
to
see
over
one
another
shoulders
as
there
was
no
great
stock
of
clothing
to
curtain
the
view
i
could
see
the
irishman
head
gleaming
like
a
meteor
through
the
forest
of
ankles
after
a
while
the
squaws
grew
less
delicate
in
their
touch
and
catching
hold
of
the
short
stiff
bristles
endeavoured
to
pluck
them
out
all
the
while
screaming
with
laughter
i
was
neither
in
the
state
of
mind
nor
the
attitude
to
enjoy
a
joke
but
there
was
a
language
in
the
back
of
barney
head
an
expression
of
patient
endurance
that
would
have
drawn
smiles
from
a
gravedigger
and
sanchez
and
the
others
were
laughing
aloud
for
a
long
time
our
comrade
endured
the
infliction
and
remained
silent
but
at
length
it
became
too
painful
for
his
patience
and
he
began
to
speak
out
arrah
now
girls
said
he
in
a
tone
of
intreaty
will
yez
be
aizy
did
yez
niver
see
rid
hair
afore
the
squaws
on
hearing
the
appeal
which
of
course
they
understood
not
only
showed
their
white
teeth
in
loud
laughter
in
trath
an
iv

on
the
sod
at
the

holy

let

alone
divil
resave
ye
for
a
set
of
the
tone
in
which
the
last
words
were
uttered
showed
that
had
at
length
lost
his
temper
but
this
only
increased
the
assiduity
of
his
tormentors
whose
mirth
now
broke
beyond
bounds
they
plucked
him
harder
than
ever
yelling
all
the
while
so
that
although
he
continued
to
scold
i
could
only
hear
him
at
intervals
ejaculating
mother
av
moses
holy
vistment
and
a
variety
of
similar
exclamations
this
scene
continued
for
several
minutes
and
then
all
at
once
there
was
a
lull
and
a
consultation
among
the
women
that
told
us
they
were
devising
some
scheme
several
girls
were
sent
off
to
the
houses
these
presently
returned
bringing
a
large
olla
and
another
vessel
of
smaller
dimensions
what
did
they
intend
to
do
with
these
we
soon
learned
the
olla
was
filled
with
water
from
the
adjacent
stream
and
carried
up
and
the
smaller
vessel
was
set
down
beside
barney
head
we
saw
that
it
contained
the
yucca
soap
of
the
northern
mexicans
they
were
going
to
wash
out
the
red
the
irishman
were
now
loosened
so
that
he
could
sit
upright
and
a
copious
coat
of
the
was
laid
on
his
head
completely
covering
his
hair
a
couple
of
sinewy
squaws
then
took
hold
of
him
by
the
shoulders
and
with
bunches
of
bark
fibres
applied
the
water
and
scrubbed
it
in
lustily
the
application
seemed
to
be
anything
but
pleasant
to
barney
who
roared
out
ducking
his
head
on
all
sides
to
avoid
it
but
this
did
not
serve
him
one
of
the
squaws
seized
the
head
between
her
hands
and
held
it
steady
while
the
other
set
to
it
afresh
and
rubbed
harder
than
ever
the
indians
yelled
and
danced
around
but
in
the
midst
of
all
i
could
hear
barney
sneezing
and
shouting
in
a
smothered
voice
holy
mother
yez
may
rub
till
yez
the
skin
aff
an
it
wo
tscztsh
come
out
i
tell
yez
it
in
the
grain
it
wo
come
out
be
me
sowl
it
wo
but
the
poor
fellow
expostulations
were
in
vain
the
scrubbing
continued
with
fresh
applications
of
the
yucca
for
ten
minutes
or
more
and
then
the
great
olla
was
lifted
and
its
contents
dashed
upon
his
head
and
shoulders
what
was
the
astonishment
of
the
women
to
find
that
instead
of
modifying
the
red
colour
it
only
showed
forth
if
possible
more
vivid
than
ever
another
olla
of
water
was
lifted
and
soused
about
the
irishman
ears
but
with
no
better
effect
barney
had
not
had
such
a
washing
for
many
a
day
at
least
not
since
he
had
been
under
the
hands
of
the
regimental
barber
when
the
squaws
saw
that
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
the
dye
still
stuck
fast
they
desisted
and
our
comrade
was
again
staked
down
his
bed
was
not
so
dry
as
before
neither
was
mine
for
the
water
had
saturated
the
ground
about
us
and
we
lay
in
mud
but
this
was
a
small
vexation
compared
with
many
others
we
were
forced
to
put
up
with
for
a
long
time
the
indian
women
and
children
clustered
around
us
each
in
turn
minutely
examining
the
head
of
our
comrade
we
too
came
in
for
a
share
of
their
curiosity
but
was
the
elephant
they
had
seen
hair
like
ours
oftentimes
upon
their
mexican
captives
but
beyond
a
doubt
barney
was
the
first
red
poll
that
had
ever
been
scratched
in
the
valley
of
navajoa
darkness
came
on
at
length
and
the
squaws
returned
to
the
village
leaving
us
in
charge
of
the
guards
who
all
the
night
sat
watchfully
beside
chapter
fifty
one
astonishing
the
natives
up
to
this
time
we
had
no
knowledge
of
the
fate
that
was
designed
for
us
but
from
all
that
we
had
ever
heard
of
these
savages
as
well
as
from
our
own
experience
of
them
we
anticipated
that
it
would
be
a
cruel
one
sanchez
however
who
knew
something
of
their
language
left
us
no
room
to
doubt
such
a
result
he
had
gathered
from
the
conversation
of
the
women
what
was
before
us
after
these
had
gone
away
he
unfolded
the
programme
as
he
had
heard
it
said
he
they
will
dance
the
mamanchic
the
great
dance
of
montezuma
that
is
a
fete
among
the
girls
and
women
next
day
will
be
a
grand
tournament
in
which
the
warriors
will
exhibit
their
skill
in
shooting
with
the
bow
in
wrestling
and
feats
of
horsemanship
if
they
would
let
me
join
them
i
could
show
them
how
sancho
besides
being
an
accomplished
torero
had
spent
his
earlier
years
in
the
circus
and
was
as
we
all
knew
a
most
splendid
horseman
on
the
third
day
continued
he
we
are
to
amuck
if
you
know
what
that
is
we
had
all
heard
of
it
and
on
the
fourth
well
upon
the
fourth
they
will
roast
us
we
might
have
been
more
startled
at
this
abrupt
declaration
had
the
idea
been
new
to
us
but
it
was
not
the
probability
of
such
an
end
had
been
in
our
thoughts
ever
since
our
capture
we
knew
that
they
did
not
save
us
at
the
mine
for
the
purpose
of
giving
us
an
easier
death
and
we
knew
too
that
these
savages
never
made
men
prisoners
to
keep
them
alive
rube
was
an
exception
but
his
story
was
a
peculiar
one
and
he
escaped
only
by
his
extreme
cunning
their
god
continued
sanchez
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
mexican
aztecs
for
these
people
are
of
that
race
it
is
believed
i
do
know
much
about
that
though
i
heard
men
talk
of
it
he
is
called
by
a
queer
hard
name
carrai
i
remember
it
quetzalcoatl
caval
that
the
word
pues
senores
he
is
a
and
fond
of
human
flesh
prefers
it
roasted
so
they
say
that
the
use
we
be
put
to
they
roast
us
to
please
him
and
at
the
same
time
to
satisfy
themselves
dos
pajaros
al
un
golpe
two
birds
with
one
stone
that
this
was
to
be
our
fate
was
no
longer
probable
but
certain
and
we
slept
upon
the
knowledge
of
it
the
best
way
we
could
in
the
morning
we
observed
dressing
and
painting
among
the
indians
after
that
began
dancing
the
dance
of
the
mamanchic
this
ceremony
took
place
upon
the
prairie
at
some
distance
out
in
front
of
the
temple
as
it
was
about
commencing
we
were
taken
from
our
spread
positions
and
dragged
up
near
it
in
order
that
we
might
witness
the
glory
of
the
nation
we
were
still
tied
however
but
allowed
to
sit
upright
this
was
some
relief
and
we
enjoyed
the
change
of
posture
much
more
than
the
spectacle
i
could
not
describe
the
dance
even
if
i
had
watched
it
which
i
did
not
as
sanchez
had
said
it
was
carried
on
only
by
the
women
of
the
tribe
processions
of
young
girls
gaily
and
fantastically
attired
and
carrying
garlands
of
flowers
circled
and
leaped
through
a
variety
of
figures
there
was
a
raised
platform
upon
which
a
warrior
and
maiden
represented
montezuma
and
his
queen
and
around
these
the
girls
danced
and
chanted
the
ceremony
ended
by
the
dancers
kneeling
in
front
in
a
grand
semicircle
i
saw
that
the
occupants
of
the
throne
were
dacoma
and
adele
i
fancied
that
the
girl
looked
sad
poor
seguin
thought
i
there
is
none
to
protect
her
now
even
the
false
father
the
medicine
chief
might
have
been
her
friend
he
too
is
out
of
the
way
and
but
i
did
not
occupy
much
time
with
thoughts
of
her
there
was
a
far
more
painful
apprehension
than
that
my
mind
as
well
as
my
eyes
had
dwelt
upon
the
temple
during
the
ceremony
we
could
see
it
from
the
spot
where
we
had
been
thrown
down
but
it
was
too
distant
for
me
to
distinguish
the
faces
of
the
white
females
that
were
clustered
along
its
terraces
she
no
doubt
was
among
them
but
i
was
unable
to
make
her
out
perhaps
it
was
better
i
was
not
near
enough
i
thought
so
at
the
time
i
saw
indian
men
among
the
captives
and
i
had
observed
dacoma
previous
to
the
commencement
of
the
dance
proudly
standing
before
them
in
all
the
paraphernalia
of
his
regal
robes
rube
had
given
me
the
character
of
this
chief
brave
but
brutal
my
heart
was
oppressed
with
a
painful
heaviness
as
we
were
hurried
back
to
our
former
places
most
of
the
next
night
was
spent
by
the
indians
in
feasting
not
so
with
us
we
were
rarely
and
scantily
fed
and
we
suffered
too
from
thirst
our
savage
guards
scarcely
deigning
to
supply
us
with
water
though
a
river
was
running
at
our
feet
another
morning
and
the
feasting
recommenced
more
sheep
and
cattle
were
slaughtered
and
the
fires
steamed
anew
with
the
red
joints
that
were
suspended
over
them
at
an
early
hour
the
warriors
arrayed
themselves
though
not
in
war
attire
and
the
tournament
commenced
we
were
again
dragged
forward
to
witness
their
savage
sports
but
placed
still
farther
out
on
the
prairie
i
could
distinguish
upon
the
terrace
of
the
temple
the
whitish
dresses
of
the
captives
the
temple
was
their
place
of
abode
sanchez
had
told
me
this
he
had
heard
it
from
the
indians
as
they
conversed
one
with
another
the
girls
were
to
remain
there
until
the
fifth
day
that
after
our
sacrifice
then
the
chief
would
choose
one
of
the
number
for
his
own
household
and
the
warriors
would
gamble
for
the
rest
oh
these
were
fearful
hours
sometimes
i
wished
that
i
could
see
her
again
once
before
i
died
and
then
reflection
whispered
me
it
was
better
not
the
knowledge
of
my
fate
would
only
add
fresh
bitterness
to
hers
oh
these
were
fearful
hours
i
looked
at
the
savage
tournament
there
were
feats
of
arms
and
feats
of
equitation
men
rode
at
a
gallop
with
one
foot
only
to
be
seen
over
the
horse
and
in
this
attitude
threw
the
javelin
or
shot
the
unerring
shaft
others
vaulted
from
horse
to
horse
as
they
swept
over
the
prairie
at
racing
speed
some
leaped
to
their
saddles
while
their
horses
were
running
at
a
gallop
and
some
exhibited
feats
with
the
lasso
then
there
was
a
mock
encounter
in
which
the
warriors
unhorsed
each
other
as
knights
of
the
olden
time
it
was
in
fact
a
magnificent
spectacle
a
grand
hippodrome
of
the
desert
but
i
had
no
eyes
for
it
it
had
more
attraction
for
sanchez
i
saw
that
he
was
observing
every
new
feat
with
interested
attention
all
at
once
he
became
restless
there
was
a
strange
expression
on
his
face
some
thought
some
sudden
resolve
had
taken
possession
of
him
say
to
your
braves
said
he
speaking
to
one
of
our
guards
in
the
navajo
tongue
say
that
i
can
beat
the
best
of
them
at
that
i
could
teach
them
to
ride
a
horse
the
savage
reported
what
his
prisoner
had
said
and
shortly
after
several
mounted
warriors
rode
up
and
replied
to
the
taunt
you
a
poor
white
slave
ride
with
the
warriors
of
navajo
ha
ha
ha
can
you
ride
upon
your
head
inquired
the
torero
on
our
heads
how
standing
upon
your
head
while
your
horse
is
in
a
gallop
no
nor
you
nor
anyone
we
are
the
best
riders
on
the
plains
we
can
not
do
that
i
can
affirmed
the
with
emphasis
he
is
boasting
he
is
a
fool
shouted
several
let
us
see
cried
one
give
him
a
horse
there
is
no
danger
give
me
my
own
horse
and
i
will
show
you
which
is
your
horse
none
of
them
now
i
suppose
but
bring
me
that
spotted
mustang
and
clear
me
a
hundred
lengths
of
him
on
the
prairie
and
i
shall
teach
you
a
trick
as
i
looked
to
ascertain
what
horse
sanchez
meant
i
saw
the
mustang
which
he
had
ridden
from
the
del
norte
i
noticed
my
own
favourite
too
browsing
with
the
rest
after
a
short
consultation
among
themselves
the
torero
request
was
acceded
to
the
horse
he
had
pointed
out
was
lassoed
out
of
the
caballada
and
brought
up
and
our
comrade
thongs
were
taken
off
the
indians
had
no
fear
of
his
escaping
they
knew
that
they
could
soon
overtake
such
a
steed
as
the
spotted
mustang
moreover
there
was
a
picket
constantly
kept
at
each
entrance
of
the
valley
even
could
he
beat
them
across
the
plains
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
get
out
to
the
open
country
the
valley
itself
was
a
prison
sanchez
was
not
long
in
making
his
preparations
he
strapped
a
tightly
on
the
back
of
his
horse
and
then
led
him
round
for
some
time
in
a
circle
keeping
him
in
the
same
track
after
practising
thus
for
a
while
he
dropped
the
bridle
and
uttered
a
peculiar
cry
on
hearing
which
the
animal
fell
into
a
slow
gallop
around
the
circle
when
the
horse
had
accomplished
two
or
three
rounds
the
torero
leaped
upon
his
back
and
performed
the
feat
of
riding
on
his
head
although
a
common
one
among
professional
equestrians
it
was
new
to
the
navajoes
who
looked
on
with
shouts
of
wonder
and
admiration
they
caused
the
torero
to
repeat
it
again
and
again
until
the
spotted
mustang
had
become
all
of
one
colour
sanchez
however
did
not
leave
off
until
he
had
given
his
spectators
the
full
programme
of
the
ring
and
had
fairly
astonished
the
natives
when
the
tournament
was
ended
and
we
were
hauled
back
to
the
the
torero
was
not
with
us
fortunate
sanchez
he
had
won
his
life
henceforth
he
was
to
be
to
the
navajo
nation
chapter
fifty
two
running
amuck
another
day
came
our
day
for
action
we
saw
our
enemies
making
their
preparations
we
saw
them
go
off
to
the
woods
and
return
bringing
clubs
freshly
cut
from
the
trees
we
saw
them
dress
as
for
or
running
at
an
early
hour
we
were
taken
forward
to
the
front
of
the
temple
on
arriving
there
i
cast
my
eyes
upward
to
the
terrace
my
betrothed
was
above
me
i
was
recognised
there
was
mud
upon
my
scanty
garments
and
spots
of
blood
there
was
dust
on
my
hair
there
were
scars
upon
my
arms
my
face
and
throat
were
stained
with
powder
blotches
of
black
burnt
powder
in
spite
of
all
i
was
recognised
the
eyes
of
love
saw
through
all
i
find
no
scene
in
all
my
experience
so
difficult
to
describe
as
this
why
there
was
none
so
terrible
none
in
which
so
many
wild
emotions
were
crowded
into
a
moment
a
love
like
ours
tantalised
by
proximity
almost
within
reach
of
each
other
embrace
yet
separated
by
relentless
fate
and
that
for
ever
the
knowledge
of
each
other
situation
the
certainty
of
my
death
these
and
a
hundred
kindred
thoughts
rushed
into
our
hearts
together
they
could
not
be
detailed
they
can
not
be
described
words
will
not
express
them
you
may
summon
fancy
to
your
aid
i
heard
her
screams
her
wild
words
and
wilder
weeping
i
saw
her
snowy
cheek
and
streaming
hair
as
frantic
she
rushed
forward
on
the
parapet
as
if
to
spring
out
i
witnessed
her
struggles
as
she
was
drawn
back
by
her
and
then
all
at
once
she
was
quiet
in
their
arms
she
had
fainted
and
was
borne
out
of
my
sight
i
was
tied
by
the
wrists
and
ankles
during
the
scene
i
had
twice
risen
to
my
feet
forced
up
by
my
emotions
but
only
to
fall
down
again
i
made
no
further
effort
but
lay
upon
the
ground
in
the
agony
of
impotence
it
was
but
a
short
moment
but
oh
the
feelings
that
passed
over
my
soul
in
that
moment
it
was
the
compressed
misery
of
a
for
a
period
of
perhaps
half
an
hour
i
regarded
not
what
was
going
on
around
me
my
mind
was
not
abstracted
but
paralysed
absolutely
dead
i
had
no
thoughts
about
anything
i
awoke
at
length
from
this
stupor
i
saw
that
the
savages
had
completed
their
preparations
for
the
cruel
sport
two
rows
of
men
extended
across
the
plain
to
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
they
were
armed
with
clubs
and
stood
facing
each
other
with
an
interval
of
three
or
four
paces
between
their
ranks
down
the
interval
we
were
to
run
receiving
blows
from
everyone
who
could
give
them
as
we
passed
should
any
of
us
succeed
in
running
through
the
whole
line
and
reach
the
mountain
foot
before
we
could
be
overtaken
the
promise
was
that
our
lives
should
be
spared
is
this
true
sanchez
i
whispered
to
the
torero
who
was
standing
near
me
no
was
the
reply
given
also
in
a
whisper
it
is
only
a
trick
to
make
you
run
the
better
and
show
them
the
more
sport
you
are
to
die
all
the
same
i
heard
them
say
so
indeed
it
would
have
been
slight
grace
had
they
given
us
our
lives
on
such
conditions
for
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
strongest
and
swiftest
man
to
have
passed
through
between
their
lines
sanchez
i
said
again
addressing
the
torero
seguin
was
your
friend
you
will
do
all
you
can
for
her
sanchez
well
knew
whom
i
meant
i
will
i
will
he
replied
seeming
deeply
affected
brave
sanchez
tell
her
how
i
felt
for
her
no
no
you
need
not
tell
her
that
i
scarce
knew
what
i
was
saying
sanchez
i
again
whispered
a
thought
that
had
been
in
my
mind
now
returning
could
you
not
a
knife
a
weapon
anything
could
you
not
drop
one
when
i
am
set
loose
it
would
be
of
no
use
you
could
not
escape
if
you
had
fifty
it
may
be
that
i
could
not
i
would
try
at
the
worst
i
can
but
die
and
better
die
with
a
weapon
in
my
hands
it
would
be
better
muttered
the
torero
in
reply
i
will
try
to
help
you
to
a
weapon
but
my
life
may
be
he
paused
if
you
look
behind
you
he
continued
in
a
significant
manner
while
he
appeared
to
examine
the
tops
of
the
distant
mountains
you
may
see
a
tomahawk
i
think
it
is
held
carelessly
it
might
be
snatched
i
understood
his
meaning
and
stole
a
glance
around
dacoma
was
at
a
few
paces
distance
superintending
the
start
i
saw
the
weapon
in
his
belt
it
was
loosely
stuck
it
might
be
snatched
i
possess
extreme
tenacity
of
life
with
energy
to
preserve
it
i
have
not
illustrated
this
energy
in
the
adventures
through
which
we
have
passed
for
up
to
a
late
period
i
was
merely
a
passive
spectator
of
the
scenes
enacted
and
in
general
disgusted
with
their
enactment
but
at
other
times
i
have
proved
the
existence
of
those
traits
in
my
character
in
the
field
of
battle
to
my
knowledge
i
have
saved
my
life
three
times
by
the
quick
perception
of
danger
and
the
promptness
to
ward
it
off
either
less
or
more
brave
i
should
have
lost
it
this
may
seem
an
enigma
it
appears
a
puzzle
it
is
an
experience
in
my
earlier
life
i
was
addicted
to
what
are
termed
manly
sports
in
running
and
leaping
i
never
met
my
superior
and
my
feats
in
such
exercises
are
still
recorded
in
the
memories
of
my
college
companions
do
not
wrong
me
and
think
that
i
am
boasting
of
these
peculiarities
the
first
is
but
an
accident
in
my
mental
character
and
others
are
only
rude
accomplishments
which
now
in
my
more
matured
life
i
see
but
little
reason
to
be
proud
of
i
mention
them
only
to
illustrate
what
follows
ever
since
the
hour
of
my
capture
i
had
busied
my
mind
with
plans
of
escape
not
the
slightest
opportunity
had
as
yet
offered
all
along
the
journey
we
had
been
guarded
with
the
most
zealous
vigilance
during
this
last
night
a
new
plan
had
occupied
me
it
had
been
suggested
by
seeing
sanchez
upon
his
horse
i
had
matured
it
all
except
getting
possession
of
a
weapon
and
i
had
hopes
of
escape
although
i
had
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
detail
them
to
the
torero
it
would
have
served
no
purpose
to
have
told
him
them
i
knew
that
i
might
escape
even
without
the
weapon
but
i
needed
it
in
case
there
might
be
in
the
tribe
a
faster
runner
than
myself
i
might
be
killed
in
the
attempt
that
was
likely
enough
but
i
knew
that
death
could
not
come
in
a
worse
shape
than
that
in
which
i
was
to
meet
it
on
the
morrow
weapon
or
no
weapon
i
was
resolved
to
escape
or
die
in
attempting
it
i
saw
them
untying
he
was
to
run
first
there
was
a
circle
of
savages
around
the
old
men
and
idlers
of
the
village
who
stood
there
only
to
witness
the
sport
there
was
no
apprehension
of
our
escaping
that
was
never
thought
of
an
inclosed
valley
with
guards
at
each
entrance
plenty
of
horses
standing
close
by
that
could
be
mounted
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
of
us
to
get
away
from
the
ground
at
least
so
thought
they
started
poor
barney
his
race
was
not
a
long
one
he
had
not
run
ten
paces
down
the
living
avenue
when
he
was
knocked
over
and
carried
back
bleeding
and
senseless
amidst
the
yells
of
the
delighted
crowd
another
of
the
men
shared
a
similar
fate
and
another
and
then
they
unbound
me
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
during
the
short
interval
allowed
me
stretched
my
limbs
imbuing
my
soul
and
body
with
all
the
energy
that
my
desperate
circumstances
enabled
me
to
concentrate
within
them
the
signal
was
again
given
for
the
indians
to
be
ready
and
they
were
soon
in
their
places
brandishing
their
long
clubs
and
impatiently
waiting
for
me
to
make
the
start
dacoma
was
behind
me
with
a
side
glance
i
had
marked
well
where
he
stood
and
backing
towards
him
under
pretence
of
getting
a
fairer
break
i
came
close
up
to
the
savage
then
suddenly
wheeling
with
the
spring
of
a
cat
and
the
dexterity
of
a
thief
i
caught
the
tomahawk
and
jerked
it
from
his
belt
i
aimed
a
blow
but
in
my
hurry
missed
him
i
had
no
time
for
another
i
turned
and
ran
he
was
so
taken
by
surprise
that
i
was
out
of
his
reach
before
he
could
make
a
motion
to
follow
me
i
ran
not
for
the
open
avenue
but
to
one
side
of
the
circle
of
spectators
where
were
the
old
men
and
idlers
these
had
drawn
their
hand
weapons
and
were
closing
towards
me
in
a
thick
rank
instead
of
endeavouring
to
break
through
them
which
i
doubted
my
ability
to
accomplish
i
threw
all
my
energy
into
the
spring
and
leaped
clear
over
their
shoulders
two
or
three
stragglers
struck
at
me
as
i
passed
them
but
missed
their
aim
and
the
next
moment
i
was
out
upon
the
open
plain
with
the
whole
village
yelling
at
my
heels
i
well
knew
for
what
i
was
running
had
it
not
been
for
that
i
should
never
have
made
the
start
i
was
running
for
the
caballada
i
was
running
too
for
my
life
and
i
required
no
encouragement
to
induce
me
to
make
the
best
of
it
i
soon
distanced
those
who
had
been
nearest
me
at
starting
but
the
swiftest
of
the
indians
were
the
young
men
who
had
formed
the
lines
and
i
saw
that
these
were
now
forging
ahead
of
the
others
still
they
were
not
gaining
upon
me
my
school
training
stood
me
in
service
now
after
a
mile
chase
i
saw
that
i
was
within
less
than
half
that
distance
of
the
caballada
and
at
least
three
hundred
yards
ahead
of
my
pursuers
but
to
my
horror
as
i
glanced
back
i
saw
mounted
men
they
were
still
far
behind
but
i
knew
they
would
soon
come
up
was
it
possible
he
could
hear
me
i
knew
that
in
these
elevated
regions
sounds
are
heard
twice
the
ordinary
distance
and
i
shouted
at
the
top
of
my
voice
moro
moro
i
did
not
halt
but
ran
on
calling
as
i
went
i
saw
a
sudden
commotion
among
the
horses
their
heads
were
tossed
up
and
then
one
dashed
out
from
the
drove
and
came
galloping
towards
me
i
knew
the
broad
black
chest
and
red
muzzle
i
knew
them
at
a
glance
it
was
my
brave
steed
my
moro
the
rest
followed
trooping
after
but
before
they
were
up
to
trample
me
i
had
met
my
horse
and
flung
myself
panting
upon
his
back
i
had
no
rein
but
my
favourite
was
used
to
the
guidance
of
my
voice
hands
and
knees
and
directing
him
through
the
herd
i
headed
for
the
western
end
of
the
valley
i
heard
the
yells
of
the
mounted
savages
as
i
cleared
the
caballada
and
looking
back
i
saw
a
string
of
twenty
or
more
coming
after
me
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
gallop
but
i
had
no
fear
of
them
now
i
knew
my
moro
too
well
and
after
i
had
cleared
the
ten
miles
of
valley
and
was
springing
up
the
steep
front
of
the
sierra
i
saw
my
pursuers
still
back
upon
the
plain
chapter
fifty
three
a
conflict
upon
a
cliff
my
horse
idle
for
days
had
recovered
his
full
action
and
bore
me
up
the
rocky
path
with
proud
springy
step
my
nerves
drew
vigour
from
his
and
the
strength
of
my
body
was
fast
returning
it
was
well
i
would
soon
be
called
upon
to
use
it
the
picket
was
still
to
be
passed
while
escaping
from
the
town
in
the
excitement
of
the
more
proximate
peril
i
had
not
thought
of
this
ulterior
one
i
now
remembered
it
it
flashed
upon
me
of
a
sudden
and
i
commenced
gathering
my
resolution
to
meet
it
i
knew
there
was
a
picket
upon
the
mountain
sanchez
had
said
so
he
had
heard
them
say
so
what
number
of
men
composed
it
sanchez
had
said
two
but
he
was
not
certain
of
this
two
would
be
enough
more
than
enough
for
me
still
weak
and
armed
as
i
was
with
a
weapon
in
the
use
of
which
i
had
little
skill
how
would
they
be
armed
doubtless
with
bows
lances
tomahawks
and
knives
the
odds
were
all
against
me
at
what
point
should
i
find
them
they
were
videttes
their
chief
duty
was
to
watch
the
plains
without
they
would
be
at
some
station
then
commanding
a
view
of
these
i
remembered
the
road
well
the
same
by
which
we
had
first
entered
the
valley
there
was
a
platform
near
the
western
brow
of
the
sierra
i
recollected
it
for
we
had
halted
upon
it
while
our
guide
went
forward
to
reconnoitre
a
cliff
overhung
this
platform
i
remembered
that
too
for
during
the
absence
of
the
guide
seguin
and
i
had
dismounted
and
climbed
it
it
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
outside
country
to
the
south
and
west
no
doubt
then
on
that
very
cliff
would
the
videttes
be
stationed
would
they
be
on
its
top
if
so
it
might
be
best
to
make
a
dash
and
pass
them
before
they
could
descend
to
the
road
running
the
risk
of
their
missiles
their
arrows
and
lances
make
a
dash
no
that
would
be
impossible
i
remembered
that
the
path
at
both
ends
of
the
platform
narrowed
to
a
width
of
only
a
few
feet
with
the
cliff
rising
above
it
and
the
canon
yawning
below
it
was
in
fact
only
a
ledge
of
the
precipice
along
which
it
was
dangerous
to
pass
even
at
a
walk
moreover
i
had
my
horse
at
the
mission
the
iron
was
worn
smooth
and
i
knew
that
the
rock
was
as
slippery
as
glass
all
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
as
i
neared
the
summit
of
the
sierra
the
prospect
was
appalling
the
peril
before
me
was
extreme
and
under
other
circumstances
i
would
have
hesitated
to
encounter
it
but
i
knew
that
that
which
threatened
from
behind
was
not
less
desperate
there
was
no
alternative
and
with
only
resolutions
as
to
how
i
should
act
i
pushed
forward
i
rode
with
caution
directing
my
horse
as
well
as
i
could
upon
the
softer
parts
of
the
trail
so
that
his
might
not
be
heard
at
every
turn
i
halted
and
scanned
the
profile
of
each
new
prospect
but
i
did
not
halt
longer
than
i
could
help
i
knew
that
i
had
no
time
to
waste
the
road
ascended
through
a
thin
wood
of
cedars
and
dwarf
pinons
it
would
zigzag
up
the
face
of
the
mountain
near
the
crest
of
the
sierra
it
turned
sharply
to
the
right
and
trended
in
to
the
brow
of
the
canon
there
the
ledge
already
mentioned
became
the
path
and
the
road
followed
its
narrow
terrace
along
the
very
face
of
the
precipice
on
reaching
this
point
i
caught
view
of
the
cliff
where
i
expected
to
see
the
vidette
i
had
guessed
correctly
he
was
there
and
to
my
agreeable
surprise
there
was
only
one
a
single
savage
he
was
seated
upon
the
very
topmost
rock
of
the
sierra
and
his
large
brown
body
was
distinctly
visible
outlined
against
the
pale
blue
sky
he
was
not
more
than
three
hundred
yards
from
me
and
about
a
third
of
that
distance
above
the
level
of
the
ledge
along
which
i
had
to
pass
i
halted
the
moment
i
caught
sight
of
him
and
sat
making
a
hurried
reconnaissance
as
yet
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
me
his
back
was
to
me
and
he
appeared
to
be
gazing
intently
towards
the
west
beside
the
rock
on
which
he
was
his
spear
was
sticking
in
the
ground
and
his
shield
bow
and
quiver
were
leaning
against
it
i
could
see
upon
his
person
the
sparkle
of
a
knife
and
tomahawk
i
have
said
my
reconnaissance
was
a
hurried
one
i
was
conscious
of
the
value
of
every
moment
and
almost
at
a
glance
i
formed
my
resolution
that
was
to
run
the
gauntlet
and
attempt
passing
before
the
indian
could
descend
to
intercept
me
obedient
to
this
impulse
i
gave
my
animal
the
signal
to
move
forward
i
rode
slowly
and
cautiously
for
two
reasons
because
my
horse
dared
not
go
otherwise
and
i
thought
that
by
riding
quietly
i
might
get
beyond
the
vidette
without
attracting
his
notice
the
torrent
was
hissing
below
its
roar
ascended
to
the
cliff
it
might
drown
the
sound
of
the
with
this
hope
i
stole
onward
my
eye
passed
rapidly
from
one
to
the
other
from
the
savage
on
the
cliff
to
the
perilous
path
along
which
my
horse
crawled
shivering
with
affright
when
i
had
advanced
about
six
lengths
upon
the
ledge
the
platform
came
in
view
and
with
it
a
group
of
objects
that
caused
me
to
reach
suddenly
forward
and
grasp
the
forelock
of
my
moro
a
sign
by
which
in
the
absence
of
a
bit
i
could
always
halt
him
he
came
at
once
to
a
stand
and
i
surveyed
the
objects
before
me
with
a
feeling
of
despair
they
were
two
horses
mustangs
and
a
man
an
indian
the
mustangs
bridled
and
saddled
were
standing
quietly
out
upon
the
platform
and
a
lasso
tied
to
the
of
one
of
them
was
coiled
around
the
wrist
of
the
indian
the
latter
was
sitting
upon
his
hams
close
up
to
the
cliff
so
that
his
back
touched
the
rock
his
arms
lay
horizontally
across
his
knees
and
upon
these
his
head
rested
i
saw
that
he
was
asleep
beside
him
were
his
bow
and
quiver
his
lance
and
shield
all
leaning
against
the
cliff
my
situation
was
a
terrible
one
i
knew
that
i
could
not
pass
him
without
being
heard
and
i
knew
that
pass
him
i
must
in
fact
i
could
not
have
gone
back
had
i
wished
it
for
i
had
already
entered
upon
the
ledge
and
was
riding
along
a
narrow
shelf
where
my
horse
could
not
possibly
have
turned
himself
all
at
once
the
idea
entered
my
mind
that
i
might
slip
to
the
ground
steal
forward
and
with
my
tomahawk
it
was
a
cruel
thought
but
it
was
the
impulse
of
instinct
the
instinct
of
it
was
not
decreed
that
i
should
adopt
so
fearful
an
alternative
moro
impatient
at
being
delayed
in
the
perilous
position
snorted
and
struck
the
rock
with
his
hoof
the
clink
of
the
iron
was
enough
for
the
sharp
ears
of
the
spanish
horses
they
neighed
on
the
instant
the
savages
sprang
to
their
feet
and
their
simultaneous
yell
told
me
that
both
had
discovered
me
i
saw
the
vidette
upon
the
cliff
pluck
up
his
spear
and
commence
hurrying
downward
but
my
attention
was
soon
exclusively
occupied
with
his
comrade
the
latter
on
seeing
me
had
leaped
to
his
feet
seized
his
bow
and
vaulted
as
if
mechanically
upon
the
back
of
his
mustang
then
uttering
a
wild
shout
he
trotted
over
the
platform
and
advanced
along
the
ledge
to
meet
me
an
arrow
whizzed
past
my
head
as
he
came
up
but
in
his
hurry
he
had
aimed
badly
our
horses
heads
met
they
stood
muzzle
to
muzzle
with
eyes
dilated
their
red
nostrils
steaming
into
each
other
both
snorted
fiercely
as
if
each
was
imbued
with
the
wrath
of
his
rider
they
seemed
to
know
that
a
was
between
us
they
seemed
conscious
too
of
their
own
danger
they
had
met
at
the
very
narrowest
part
of
the
ledge
neither
could
have
turned
or
backed
off
again
one
or
other
must
go
over
the
cliff
must
fall
through
a
depth
of
a
thousand
feet
into
the
stony
channel
of
the
torrent
i
sat
with
a
feeling
of
utter
helplessness
i
had
no
weapon
with
which
i
could
reach
my
antagonist
no
missile
he
had
his
bow
and
i
saw
him
adjusting
a
second
arrow
to
the
string
at
this
crisis
three
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
not
as
i
detail
them
here
but
following
each
other
like
quick
flashes
of
lightning
my
first
impulse
was
to
urge
my
horse
forward
trusting
to
his
superior
weight
to
precipitate
the
lighter
animal
from
the
ledge
had
i
been
worth
a
bridle
and
spurs
i
should
have
adopted
this
plan
but
i
had
neither
and
the
chances
were
too
desperate
without
them
i
abandoned
it
for
another
i
would
hurl
my
tomahawk
at
the
head
of
my
antagonist
no
the
third
thought
i
will
dismount
and
use
my
weapon
upon
the
mustang
this
last
was
clearly
the
best
and
obedient
to
its
impulse
i
slipped
down
between
moro
and
the
cliff
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
hist
of
another
arrow
passing
my
cheek
it
had
missed
me
from
the
suddenness
of
my
movements
in
an
instant
i
squeezed
past
the
flanks
of
my
horse
and
glided
forward
upon
the
ledge
directly
in
front
of
my
adversary
the
animal
seeming
to
guess
my
intentions
snorted
with
affright
and
reared
up
but
was
compelled
to
drop
again
into
the
same
tracks
the
indian
was
fixing
another
shaft
its
notch
never
reached
the
string
as
the
hoofs
of
the
mustang
came
down
upon
the
rock
i
aimed
my
blow
i
struck
the
animal
over
the
eye
i
felt
the
skull
yielding
before
my
hatchet
and
the
next
moment
horse
and
rider
the
latter
screaming
and
struggling
to
clear
himself
of
the
saddle
disappeared
over
the
cliff
there
was
a
moment
silence
a
long
moment
in
which
i
knew
they
were
falling
falling
down
that
fearful
depth
then
came
a
loud
splash
the
concussion
of
their
united
bodies
on
the
water
below
i
had
no
curiosity
to
look
over
and
as
little
time
when
i
regained
my
upright
attitude
for
i
had
come
to
my
knees
in
giving
the
blow
i
saw
the
vidette
just
leaping
upon
the
platform
he
did
not
halt
a
moment
but
advanced
at
a
run
holding
his
spear
at
the
charge
i
saw
that
i
should
be
impaled
unless
i
could
parry
the
thrust
i
struck
wildly
but
with
success
the
glinted
from
the
head
of
my
weapon
its
shaft
passed
me
and
our
bodies
met
with
a
shock
that
caused
us
both
to
reel
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
my
balance
i
followed
up
my
blows
keeping
close
to
my
antagonist
so
that
he
could
not
again
use
his
lance
seeing
this
he
dropped
the
weapon
and
drew
his
tomahawk
we
now
fought
hand
to
hand
hatchet
to
hatchet
backward
and
forward
along
the
ledge
we
drove
each
other
as
the
advantage
of
the
blows
told
in
favour
of
either
or
against
him
several
times
we
grappled
and
would
have
pushed
each
other
over
but
the
fear
that
each
felt
of
being
dragged
after
mutually
restrained
us
and
we
let
go
and
trusted
again
to
our
tomahawks
not
a
word
passed
between
us
we
had
nothing
to
say
even
could
we
have
understood
each
other
but
we
had
no
boast
to
make
no
taunt
to
urge
nothing
before
our
minds
but
the
fixed
dark
purpose
of
murdering
one
another
after
the
first
onset
the
indian
had
ceased
yelling
and
we
both
fought
in
the
intense
earnestness
of
silence
there
were
sounds
though
an
occasional
sharp
exclamation
our
quick
high
breathing
the
clinking
of
our
tomahawks
the
neighing
of
our
horses
and
the
continuous
roar
of
the
torrent
these
were
the
symphonies
of
our
conflict
for
some
minutes
we
battled
upon
the
ledge
we
were
both
cut
and
bruised
in
several
places
but
neither
of
us
had
as
yet
received
or
inflicted
a
mortal
wound
at
length
after
a
continuous
shower
of
blows
i
succeeded
in
beating
my
adversary
back
until
we
found
ourselves
out
upon
the
platform
there
we
had
ample
room
to
wind
our
weapons
and
we
struck
with
more
energy
than
ever
after
a
few
strokes
our
tomahawks
met
with
a
violent
concussion
that
sent
them
flying
from
our
hands
neither
dared
stoop
to
regain
his
weapon
and
we
rushed
upon
each
other
with
naked
arms
clutched
wrestled
a
moment
and
then
fell
together
to
the
earth
i
thought
my
antagonist
had
a
knife
i
must
have
been
mistaken
otherwise
he
would
have
used
it
but
without
it
i
soon
found
that
in
this
species
of
encounter
he
was
my
master
his
muscular
arms
encircled
me
until
my
ribs
cracked
under
the
embrace
we
rolled
along
the
ground
over
and
over
each
other
oh
god
we
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
precipice
i
could
not
free
myself
from
his
grasp
his
sinewy
fingers
were
across
my
throat
they
clasped
me
tightly
around
the
trachea
stopping
my
breath
he
was
strangling
me
i
grew
weak
and
nerveless
i
could
resist
no
longer
i
felt
my
hold
relax
i
grew
weaker
and
weaker
i
was
dying
i
was
i
oh
heaven
pard
on
oh
i
could
not
have
been
long
insensible
for
when
consciousness
returned
i
was
still
warm
sweating
from
the
effects
of
the
struggle
and
my
wounds
were
bleeding
freshly
and
freely
i
felt
that
i
yet
lived
i
saw
that
i
was
still
upon
the
platform
but
where
was
my
antagonist
why
had
not
he
finished
me
why
had
not
he
flung
me
over
the
cliff
i
rose
upon
my
elbow
and
looked
around
i
could
see
no
living
things
but
my
own
horse
and
that
of
the
indian
galloping
over
the
platform
kicking
and
plunging
at
each
other
but
i
heard
sounds
sounds
of
fearful
import
like
the
hoarse
angry
worrying
of
dogs
mingling
with
the
cries
of
a
human
voice
a
voice
uttered
in
agony
what
could
it
mean
i
saw
that
there
was
a
break
in
the
platform
a
deep
cut
in
the
rock
and
out
of
this
the
sounds
appeared
to
issue
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
tottering
towards
the
spot
looked
in
it
was
an
awful
sight
to
look
upon
the
gully
was
some
ten
feet
in
depth
and
at
its
bottom
among
the
weeds
and
cacti
a
huge
dog
was
engaged
in
tearing
something
that
screamed
and
struggled
it
was
a
man
an
indian
all
was
explained
at
a
glance
the
dog
was
alp
the
man
was
my
late
antagonist
as
i
came
upon
the
edge
the
dog
was
on
the
top
of
his
adversary
and
kept
himself
uppermost
by
desperate
bounds
from
side
to
side
still
dashing
the
other
back
as
he
attempted
to
rise
to
his
feet
the
savage
was
crying
in
despair
i
thought
i
saw
the
teeth
of
the
animal
fast
in
his
throat
but
i
watched
the
struggle
no
longer
voices
from
behind
caused
me
to
turn
round
my
pursuers
had
reached
the
canon
and
were
urging
their
animals
along
the
ledge
i
staggered
to
my
horse
and
springing
upon
his
back
once
more
directed
him
to
the
terrace
that
part
which
led
outward
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
cleared
the
cliff
and
was
hurrying
down
the
mountain
as
i
approached
its
foot
i
heard
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
that
on
both
sides
lined
the
path
then
an
object
sprang
out
a
short
distance
behind
me
it
was
the
saint
bernard
as
he
came
alongside
he
uttered
a
low
whimper
and
once
or
twice
wagged
his
tail
i
knew
not
how
he
could
have
escaped
for
he
must
have
waited
until
the
indians
reached
the
platform
but
the
fresh
blood
that
stained
his
jaws
and
clotted
the
shaggy
hair
upon
his
breast
showed
that
he
had
left
one
with
but
little
power
to
detain
him
on
reaching
the
plain
i
looked
back
i
saw
my
pursuers
coming
down
the
face
of
the
sierra
but
i
had
still
nearly
half
a
mile
of
start
and
taking
the
snowy
mountain
for
my
guide
i
struck
out
into
the
open
prairie
chapter
fifty
four
an
unexpected
rencontre
as
i
rode
off
from
the
mountain
foot
the
white
peak
glistened
at
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
there
was
not
a
hillock
between
not
a
brake
or
bush
excepting
the
low
shrubs
of
the
artemisia
it
was
not
yet
noon
could
i
reach
the
snowy
mountain
before
sunset
if
so
i
trusted
in
being
able
to
follow
our
old
trail
to
the
mine
thence
i
might
keep
on
to
the
del
norte
by
striking
a
branch
of
the
paloma
or
some
other
lateral
stream
such
were
my
plans
undefined
as
i
rode
forth
i
knew
that
i
should
be
pursued
almost
to
the
gates
of
el
paso
and
when
i
had
ridden
forward
about
a
mile
a
glance
to
the
rear
showed
me
that
the
indians
had
just
reached
the
plain
and
were
striking
out
after
me
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
speed
i
knew
that
i
had
the
heels
of
their
whole
cavalcade
did
my
horse
possess
the
bottom
i
knew
the
tireless
wiry
nature
of
the
spanish
mustang
and
their
animals
were
of
that
race
i
knew
they
could
gallop
for
a
long
day
without
breaking
down
and
this
led
me
to
fear
for
the
result
speed
was
nothing
now
and
i
made
no
attempt
to
keep
it
up
i
was
determined
to
economise
the
strength
of
my
steed
i
could
not
be
overtaken
so
long
as
he
lasted
and
i
galloped
slowly
forward
watching
the
movements
of
my
pursuers
and
keeping
a
regular
distance
ahead
of
them
at
times
i
dismounted
to
relieve
my
horse
and
ran
alongside
of
him
my
dog
followed
occasionally
looking
up
in
my
face
and
seemingly
conscious
why
i
was
making
such
a
hurried
journey
during
all
the
day
i
was
never
out
of
sight
of
the
indians
in
fact
i
could
have
distinguished
their
arms
and
counted
their
numbers
at
any
time
there
were
in
all
about
a
score
of
horsemen
the
stragglers
had
gone
back
and
only
the
men
now
continued
the
pursuit
as
i
neared
the
foot
of
the
snowy
peak
i
remembered
there
was
water
at
our
old
in
the
pass
and
i
pushed
my
horse
faster
in
order
to
gain
time
to
refresh
both
him
and
myself
i
intended
to
make
a
short
halt
and
allow
the
noble
brute
to
breathe
himself
and
snatch
a
bite
of
the
that
grew
around
the
spring
there
was
nothing
to
fear
so
long
as
his
strength
held
out
and
i
knew
that
this
was
the
plan
to
sustain
it
it
was
near
sundown
as
i
entered
the
defile
before
riding
in
among
the
rocks
i
looked
back
during
the
last
hour
i
had
gained
upon
my
pursuers
they
were
still
at
least
three
miles
out
upon
the
plain
and
i
saw
that
they
were
toiling
on
wearily
i
fell
into
a
train
of
reflection
as
i
rode
down
the
ravine
i
was
now
upon
a
known
trail
my
spirits
rose
my
hopes
so
long
clouded
over
began
to
assume
a
brightness
and
buoyancy
greater
from
the
very
influence
of
reaction
i
should
still
be
able
to
rescue
my
betrothed
my
whole
energies
my
fortune
my
life
would
be
devoted
to
this
one
object
i
would
raise
a
band
stronger
than
ever
seguin
had
commanded
i
should
get
followers
among
the
returning
employes
of
the
caravan
teamsters
whose
term
of
service
had
expired
i
would
search
the
posts
and
mountain
rendezvous
for
trappers
and
hunters
i
would
apply
to
the
mexican
government
for
aid
in
money
in
troops
i
would
appeal

the
citizens
of
el

of

echoed
the
hunters
simultaneously
raising
their
rifles
and
looking
up
the
ravine
how
many
about
twenty
are
they
close
upon
you
no
how
long
before
we
may
expect
them
they
are
three
miles
back
with
tired
horses

you
may

hour
at
any
rate
come

have
time
to
go
down
and
make
arrangements
for
their
reception
rube

rest

remain
here
we
shall
join
you
before
they
get
forward
come
haller
come
following
my
faithful
and
friend
i
rode
on
to
the
spring
around
it
i
found
the
army
and
it
had
somewhat
of
that
appearance
for
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
men
were
in
uniform
these
were
the
volunteer
guards
of
chihuahua
and
el
paso
the
late
raid
of
the
indians
had
exasperated
the
inhabitants
and
this
unusually
strong
muster
was
the
consequence
seguin
with
the
remnant
of
his
band
had
met
them
at
el
paso
and
hurried
them
forward
on
the
navajo
trail
it
was
from
him
saint
vrain
had
heard
of
my
capture
and
in
hopes
of
rescuing
me
had
joined
the
expedition
with
about
forty
or
fifty
employes
of
the
caravan
most
of
seguin
band
had
escaped
after
the
fight
in
the
barranca
and
among
the
rest
i
was
rejoiced
to
hear
el
sol
and
la
luna
they
were
now
on
their
return
with
seguin
and
i
found
them
at
his
tent
seguin
welcomed
me
as
the
bearer
of
joyful
news
they
were
still
safe
that
was
all
i
could
tell
him
and
all
he
asked
for
during
our
hurried
congratulation
we
had
no
time
for
idle
talk
a
hundred
men
immediately
mounted
and
rode
up
the
ravine
on
reaching
the
ground
occupied
by
the
picket
they
led
their
horses
behind
the
rocks
and
formed
an
ambuscade
the
order
was
that
all
the
indians
must
be
killed
or
taken
the
plan
hastily
agreed
upon
was
to
let
them
pass
the
ambushed
men
and
ride
on
until
they
had
got
in
sight
of
the
main
body
then
both
divisions
were
to
close
upon
them
it
was
a
dry
ravine
above
the
spring
and
the
horses
had
made
no
tracks
upon
its
rocky
bed
moreover
the
indians
ardent
in
their
pursuit
of
me
would
not
be
on
the
outlook
for
any
sign
before
reaching
the
water
should
they
pass
the
ambuscade
then
not
a
man
of
them
would
escape
as
the
defile
on
both
sides
was
walled
in
by
a
precipice
after
the
others
had
gone
about
a
hundred
men
at
the
spring
leaped
into
their
saddles
and
sat
with
their
eyes
bent
up
the
pass
they
were
not
long
kept
waiting
a
few
minutes
after
the
ambuscade
had
been
placed
an
indian
showed
himself
round
an
angle
of
the
rock
about
two
hundred
yards
above
the
spring
he
was
the
foremost
of
the
warriors
and
must
have
passed
the
ambushed
horsemen
but
as
yet
the
latter
lay
still
seeing
a
body
of
men
the
savage
halted
with
a
quick
jerk
and
then
uttering
a
cry
wheeled
and
rode
back
upon
his
comrades
these
imitating
his
example
wheeled
also
but
before
they
had
fairly
turned
themselves
in
the
ravine
the
cached
horsemen
sprang
out
in
a
body
from
the
rocks
and
came
galloping
down
the
indians
now
seeing
that
they
were
completely
in
the
trap
with
overpowering
numbers
on
both
sides
of
them
threw
down
their
spears
and
begged
for
mercy
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
all
captured
the
whole
affair
did
not
occupy
half
an
hour
and
with
our
prisoners
securely
tied
we
returned
to
the
spring
the
leading
men
now
gathered
around
seguin
to
settle
on
some
plan
for
attacking
the
town
should
we
move
on
to
it
that
night
i
was
asked
for
my
advice
and
of
course
answered
yes
the
sooner
the
better
for
the
safety
of
the
captives
my
feelings
as
well
as
those
of
seguin
could
not
brook
delay
besides
several
of
our
late
comrades
were
to
die
on
the
morrow
we
might
still
be
in
time
to
save
them
how
were
we
to
approach
the
valley
this
was
the
next
point
to
be
discussed
the
enemy
would
now
be
certain
to
have
their
videttes
at
both
ends
and
it
promised
to
be
clear
moonlight
until
morning
they
could
easily
see
such
a
large
body
approaching
from
the
open
plain
here
then
was
a
difficulty
let
us
divide
said
one
of
seguin
old
band
let
a
party
go
in
at
each
end
that
git
in
the
trap
wagh
replied
another
that
would
never
do
thar
ten
miles
rough
wood
thar
if
we
raised
the
niggurs
by
such
a
show
as
this
they
take
to
them
gals
and
all
an
that
the
last
we
see
them
this
speaker
was
clearly
in
the
right
it
would
never
do
to
make
our
attack
openly
stratagem
must
again
be
used
a
head
was
now
called
into
the
council
that
soon
mastered
the
difficulty
as
it
had
many
another
that
was
the
skinless
earless
head
of
the
trapper
rube
cap
said
he
after
a
short
delay
need
show
yur
crowd
till
we
first
took
the
by
the
eend
o
the
kenyun
how
can
we
take
them
inquired
seguin
strip
them
twenty
niggurs
replied
rube
pointing
to
our
captives
an
let
twenty
o
us
put
on
their
duds
then
we
kin
take
the
young
fellur
him
hyur
as
tuk
me
for
the
grizzly
he
he
he
ole
rube
tuk
for
a
grizzly
we
kin
take
him
back
a
now
cap
do
see
how
you
would
have
these
twenty
to
keep
far
in
the
advance
then
capture
the
videttes
and
wait
till
the
main
body
comes
up
sartinly
thet
my
idee
adzactly
it
is
the
best
the
only
one
we
shall
follow
it
and
seguin
immediately
ordered
the
indians
to
be
stripped
of
their
dresses
these
consisted
mostly
of
garments
that
had
been
plundered
from
the
people
of
the
mexican
towns
and
were
of
all
cuts
and
colours
i
recommend
cap
suggested
rube
seeing
that
seguin
was
looking
out
to
choose
the
men
for
his
advance
party
i
recommend
to
take
a
smart
sprinklin
of
the
delawars
them
navaghs
is
mighty
and
not
easily
bamfoozled
they
mout
sight
white
skin
by
moonlight
them
o
us
that
must
go
along
have
to
paint
injun
or
we
be
fooled
arter
all
we
will
seguin
taking
this
hint
selected
for
the
advance
most
of
the
delaware
and
shawano
indians
and
these
were
now
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
the
navajoes
he
himself
with
rube
garey
and
a
few
other
whites
made
up
the
required
number
i
of
course
was
to
go
along
and
play
the
role
of
a
prisoner
the
whites
of
the
party
soon
accomplished
their
change
of
dress
and
painted
injun
a
trick
of
the
prairie
toilet
well
known
to
all
of
them
rube
had
but
little
change
to
make
his
hue
was
already
of
sufficient
deepness
for
the
disguise
and
he
was
not
going
to
trouble
himself
by
throwing
off
the
old
shirt
or
leggings
that
could
hardly
have
been
done
without
cutting
both
open
and
rube
was
not
likely
to
make
such
a
sacrifice
of
his
favourite
buckskins
he
proceeded
to
draw
the
other
garments
over
them
and
in
a
short
time
was
habited
in
a
pair
of
slashing
calzoneros
with
bright
buttons
from
the
hip
to
the
ankle
these
with
a
smart
jacket
that
had
fallen
to
his
share
and
a
jaunty
sombrero
cocked
upon
his
head
gave
him
the
air
of
a
most
comical
dandy
the
men
fairly
yelled
at
seeing
him
thus
metamorphosed
and
old
rube
himself
grinned
heartily
at
the
odd
feelings
which
the
dress
occasioned
him
before
the
sun
had
set
everything
was
in
readiness
and
the
advance
started
off
the
main
body
under
saint
vrain
was
to
follow
an
hour
after
a
few
men
mexicans
remained
by
the
spring
in
charge
of
the
navajo
prisoners
chapter
fifty
five
the
rescue
we
struck
directly
across
the
plain
for
the
eastern
entrance
of
the
valley
we
reached
the
canon
about
two
hours
before
day
everything
turned
out
as
we
had
anticipated
there
was
an
outpost
of
five
indians
at
the
end
of
the
pass
but
we
had
stolen
upon
them
unawares
and
they
were
captured
without
the
necessity
of
our
firing
a
shot
the
main
body
came
up
soon
after
and
preceded
by
our
party
as
before
passed
through
the
canon
arriving
at
the
border
of
the
woods
nearest
the
town
we
halted
and
concealed
ourselves
among
the
trees
the
town
was
glistening
in
the
clear
moonlight
and
deep
silence
was
over
the
valley
there
were
none
stirring
at
so
early
an
hour
but
we
could
descry
two
or
three
dark
objects
down
by
the
river
we
knew
them
to
be
the
sentinels
that
stood
over
our
captive
comrades
the
sight
was
gratifying
for
it
told
us
they
still
lived
they
little
dreamed
poor
fellows
how
near
was
the
hour
of
their
deliverance
for
the
same
reasons
that
had
influenced
us
on
a
former
occasion
the
attack
was
not
to
be
made
until
daybreak
and
we
waited
as
before
but
with
a
very
different
prospect
there
were
now
six
hundred
warriors
in
the
town
about
our
own
number
and
we
knew
that
a
desperate
engagement
was
before
us
we
had
no
fear
as
to
the
result
but
we
feared
that
the
vengeful
savages
might
take
it
into
their
heads
to
despatch
their
captives
while
we
fought
they
knew
that
to
recover
these
was
our
main
object
and
if
themselves
defeated
that
would
give
them
the
satisfaction
of
a
terrible
vengeance
all
this
we
knew
was
far
from
improbable
but
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
such
an
event
every
precaution
was
to
be
taken
we
were
satisfied
that
the
captive
women
were
still
in
the
temple
rube
assured
us
that
it
was
their
universal
custom
to
keep
new
prisoners
there
for
several
days
after
their
arrival
until
they
were
finally
distributed
among
the
warriors
the
queen
too
dwelt
in
this
building
it
was
resolved
then
that
the
disguised
party
should
ride
forward
conducting
me
as
their
prisoner
by
the
first
light
and
that
they
should
surround
the
temple
and
by
a
clever
secure
the
white
captives
a
signal
then
given
on
the
bugle
or
the
first
shot
fired
was
to
bring
the
main
body
forward
at
a
gallop
this
was
plainly
the
best
plan
and
having
fully
arranged
its
details
we
waited
the
approach
of
the
dawn
it
was
not
long
in
coming
the
moonlight
became
mixed
with
the
faint
rays
of
the
aurora
and
objects
were
seen
more
distinctly
as
the
milky
quartz
caught
the
hues
of
morning
we
rode
out
of
our
cover
and
forward
over
the
plain
i
was
apparently
tied
upon
my
horse
and
guarded
between
two
of
the
delawares
on
approaching
the
town
we
saw
several
men
upon
the
roofs
they
ran
to
and
fro
summoning
others
out
and
large
groups
began
to
appear
along
the
terraces
as
we
came
nearer
we
were
greeted
with
shouts
of
congratulation
avoiding
the
streets
we
pushed
directly
for
the
temple
at
a
brisk
trot
on
arriving
at
its
base
we
suddenly
halted
flung
ourselves
from
our
horses
and
climbed
the
ladders
there
were
many
women
upon
the
parapets
of
the
building
among
these
seguin
recognised
his
daughter
the
queen
she
was
at
once
secured
and
forced
into
the
inside
the
next
moment
i
held
my
betrothed
in
my
arms
while
her
mother
was
by
our
side
the
other
captives
were
there
and
without
waiting
to
offer
any
explanation
we
hurried
them
all
within
the
rooms
and
guarded
the
doors
with
our
pistols
the
whole
manoeuvre
had
not
occupied
two
minutes
but
before
its
completion
a
wild
cry
announced
that
the
ruse
was
detected
vengeful
yells
rang
over
the
town
and
the
warriors
leaping
down
from
their
houses
ran
towards
the
temple
arrows
began
to
hurtle
around
us
but
above
all
other
sounds
pealed
the
notes
of
the
bugle
summoning
our
comrades
to
the
attack
quick
upon
the
signal
they
were
seen
debouching
from
the
woods
and
coming
down
at
a
gallop
when
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
houses
the
charging
horsemen
divided
into
two
columns
and
wheeled
round
the
town
with
the
intention
of
attacking
it
on
both
sides
the
indians
hastened
to
defend
the
skirts
of
the
village
but
in
spite
of
their
which
dismounted
several
the
horsemen
closed
in
and
flinging
themselves
from
their
horses
fought
hand
to
hand
among
the
walls
the
shouts
of
defiance
the
sharp
ringing
of
rifles
and
the
louder
reports
of
the
escopettes
soon
announced
that
the
battle
had
fairly
begun
a
large
party
headed
by
el
sol
and
saint
vrain
had
ridden
up
to
the
temple
seeing
that
we
had
secured
the
captives
these
too
dismounted
and
commenced
an
attack
upon
that
part
of
the
town
clambering
up
to
the
houses
and
driving
out
the
braves
who
defended
them
the
fight
now
became
general
shouts
and
sounds
of
shots
rent
the
air
men
were
seen
upon
high
roofs
face
to
face
in
deadly
and
desperate
conflict
crowds
of
women
screaming
and
terrified
rushed
along
the
terraces
or
ran
out
upon
the
plain
making
for
the
woods
frightened
horses
snorting
and
neighing
galloped
through
the
streets
and
off
over
the
open
prairie
with
trailing
bridles
while
others
inclosed
in
corrals
plunged
and
broke
over
the
walls
it
was
a
wild
scene
a
terrific
picture
through
all
i
was
only
a
spectator
i
was
guarding
a
door
of
the
temple
in
which
were
our
own
friends
my
elevated
position
gave
me
a
view
of
the
whole
village
and
i
could
trace
the
progress
of
the
battle
from
house
to
house
i
saw
that
many
were
falling
on
both
sides
for
the
savages
fought
with
the
courage
of
despair
i
had
no
fears
for
the
result
the
whites
too
had
wrongs
to
redress
and
by
the
remembrance
of
these
were
equally
nerved
for
the
struggle
in
this
kind
of
encounter
they
had
the
advantage
in
arms
it
was
only
on
the
plains
that
their
savage
foes
were
feared
when
charging
with
their
long
and
lances
as
i
continued
to
gaze
over
the
azoteas
a
terrific
scene
riveted
my
attention
and
i
forgot
all
others
upon
a
high
roof
two
men
were
engaged
in
combat
fierce
and
deadly
their
brilliant
dresses
had
attracted
me
and
i
soon
recognised
the
combatants
they
were
dacoma
and
the
maricopa
the
navajo
fought
with
a
spear
and
i
saw
that
the
other
held
his
rifle
clubbed
and
empty
when
my
eye
first
rested
upon
them
the
latter
had
just
parried
a
thrust
and
was
aiming
a
blow
at
his
antagonist
it
fell
without
effect
and
dacoma
turning
quickly
brought
his
lance
again
to
the
charge
before
el
sol
could
ward
it
off
the
thrust
was
given
and
the
weapon
appeared
to
pass
through
his
body
i
involuntarily
uttered
a
cry
as
i
expected
to
see
the
noble
indian
fall
what
was
my
astonishment
at
seeing
him
brandish
his
tomahawk
over
his
head
and
with
a
crashing
blow
stretch
the
navajo
at
his
feet
drawn
down
by
the
impaling
shaft
he
fell
over
the
body
but
in
a
moment
struggled
up
again
drew
the
long
lance
from
his
flesh
and
tottering
forward
to
the
parapet
shouted
out
here
luna
our
mother
is
avenged
i
saw
the
girl
spring
upon
the
roof
followed
by
garey
and
the
next
moment
the
wounded
man
sank
fainting
in
the
arms
of
the
trapper
rube
saint
vrain
and
several
others
now
climbed
to
the
roof
and
commenced
examining
the
wound
i
watched
them
with
feelings
of
painful
suspense
for
the
character
of
this
most
singular
man
had
inspired
me
with
friendship
presently
saint
vrain
joined
me
and
i
was
assured
that
the
wound
was
not
mortal
the
maricopa
would
live
the
battle
was
now
ended
the
warriors
who
survived
had
fled
to
the
forest
shots
were
heard
only
at
intervals
an
occasional
shout
the
shriek
of
some
savage
discovered
lurking
among
the
walls
many
white
captives
had
been
found
in
the
town
and
were
brought
in
front
of
the
temple
guarded
by
the
mexicans
the
indian
women
had
escaped
to
the
woods
during
the
engagement
it
was
well
for
the
hunters
and
volunteer
soldiery
exasperated
by
wounds
and
heated
by
the
conflict
now
raged
around
like
furies
smoke
ascended
from
many
of
the
houses
flames
followed
and
the
greater
part
of
the
town
was
soon
reduced
to
a
smouldering
ruin
we
stayed
all
that
day
by
the
navajo
village
to
recruit
our
animals
and
prepare
for
our
homeward
journey
across
the
desert
the
plundered
cattle
were
collected
some
were
slaughtered
for
immediate
use
and
the
rest
placed
in
charge
of
vaqueros
to
be
driven
on
the
hoof
most
of
the
indian
horses
were
lassoed
and
brought
in
some
to
be
ridden
by
the
rescued
captives
others
as
the
booty
of
the
conquerors
but
it
was
not
safe
to
remain
long
in
the
valley
there
were
other
tribes
of
the
navajoes
to
the
north
who
would
soon
be
down
upon
us
there
were
their
allies
the
great
nations
of
the
apaches
to
the
south
and
the
nijoras
to
the
west
and
we
knew
that
all
these
would
unite
and
follow
on
our
trail
the
object
of
the
expedition
was
attained
at
least
as
far
as
its
leader
had
designed
it
a
great
number
of
captives
were
recovered
whose
friends
had
long
since
mourned
them
as
lost
for
ever
it
would
be
some
time
before
they
would
renew
those
savage
forays
in
which
they
had
annually
desolated
the
pueblos
of
the
frontier
by
sunrise
of
the
next
day
we
had
repassed
the
canon
and
were
riding
towards
the
snowy
mountain

will
not
describe
the
recrossing
of
the
desert
plains
nor
will
i
detail
the
incidents
of
our
homeward
journey
with
all
its
hardships
and
weariness
to
me
it
was
a
pleasant
one
it
is
a
pleasure
to
attend
upon
her
we
love
and
that
along
the
route
was
my
chief
duty
the
smiles
i
received
far
more
than
repaid
me
for
the
labour
i
underwent
in
its
discharge
but
it
was
not
labour
it
was
no
labour
to
fill
her
xuages
with
fresh
water
at
every
spring
or
runlet
to
spread
the
blanket
softly
over
her
saddle
to
weave
her
a
out
of
the
broad
leaves
of
the
palmilla
to
assist
her
in
mounting
and
dismounting
no
that
was
not
labour
to
me
we
were
happy
as
we
journeyed
i
was
happy
for
i
knew
that
i
had
fulfilled
my
contract
and
won
my
bride
and
the
very
remembrance
of
the
perils
through
which
we
had
so
lately
passed
heightened
the
happiness
of
both
but
one
thing
cast
an
occasional
gloom
over
our
thoughts
the
queen
adele
she
was
returning
to
the
home
of
her
childhood
not
voluntarily
but
as
a
captive
captive
to
her
own
kindred
her
father
and
mother
throughout
the
journey
both
these
waited
upon
her
with
tender
assiduity
almost
constantly
gazing
at
her
with
sad
and
silent
looks
there
was
woe
in
their
hearts
we
were
not
pursued
or
if
so
our
pursuers
never
came
up
perhaps
we
were
not
followed
at
all
the
foe
had
been
crippled
and
cowed
by
the
terrible
chastisement
and
we
knew
it
would
be
some
time
before
they
could
muster
force
enough
to
take
our
trail
still
we
lost
not
a
moment
but
travelled
as
fast
as
the
ganados
could
be
pushed
forward
in
five
days
we
reached
the
barranca
del
oro
and
passed
the
old
mine
the
scene
of
our
bloody
conflict
during
our
halt
among
the
ruined
ranches
i
strayed
away
from
the
rest
impelled
by
a
painful
curiosity
to
see
if
aught
remained
of
my
late
follower
or
his
i
went
to
the
spot
where
i
had
last
seen
their
bodies
yes
two
skeletons
lay
in
front
of
the
shaft
as
cleanly
picked
by
the
wolves
as
if
they
had
been
dressed
for
the
studio
of
an
anatomist
it
was
all
that
remained
of
the
unfortunate
men
after
leaving
the
barranca
del
oro
we
struck
the
head
waters
of
the
rio
mimbres
and
keeping
on
the
banks
of
that
stream
followed
it
down
to
the
del
norte
next
day
we
entered
the
pueblo
of
el
paso
a
scene
of
singular
interest
greeted
us
on
our
arrival
as
we
neared
the
town
the
whole
population
flocked
out
to
meet
us
some
had
come
forth
from
curiosity
some
to
welcome
us
and
take
part
in
the
ceremony
that
hailed
our
triumphant
return
but
not
a
few
impelled
by
far
different
motives
we
had
brought
with
us
a
large
number
of
rescued
captives
nearly
fifty
in
all
and
these
were
soon
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
citizens
in
that
crowd
were
yearning
mothers
and
fond
sisters
lovers
newly
awakened
from
despair
and
husbands
who
had
not
yet
ceased
to
mourn
there
were
hurried
inquiries
and
quick
glances
that
betokened
keen
anxiety
there
were
scenes
and
shouts
of
joy
as
each
one
recognised
some
object
of
a
dear
affection
but
there
were
other
scenes
of
a
diverse
character
scenes
of
woe
and
wailing
for
of
many
of
those
who
had
gone
forth
but
a
few
days
before
in
the
pride
of
health
and
the
panoply
of
war
many
came
not
back
i
was
particularly
struck
with
one
episode
a
painful
one
to
witness
two
women
of
the
poblana
class
had
laid
hold
upon
one
of
the
captives
a
girl
of
i
should
think
about
ten
years
of
age
each
claimed
the
girl
for
her
daughter
and
each
of
them
held
one
of
her
arms
not
rudely
but
to
hinder
the
other
from
carrying
her
off
a
crowd
had
encircled
them
and
both
the
women
were
urging
their
claims
in
loud
and
plaintive
voice
one
stated
the
age
of
the
girl
hastily
narrated
the
history
of
her
capture
by
the
savages
and
pointed
to
certain
marks
upon
her
person
to
which
she
declared
she
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
make
the
other
appealed
to
the
spectators
to
look
at
the
colour
of
the
hair
and
eyes
which
slightly
differed
from
that
of
the
other
claimant
and
called
upon
them
to
note
the
resemblance
she
bore
to
another
who
stood
by
and
who
she
alleged
was
the
child
eldest
sister
both
talked
at
the
same
time
and
kissed
the
girl
repeatedly
as
they
talked
the
little
wild
captive
stood
between
the
two
receiving
their
alternate
embraces
with
a
wondering
and
puzzled
expression
she
was
in
truth
a
most
interesting
child
habited
in
the
indian
costume
and
browned
by
the
sun
of
the
desert
whichever
might
have
been
the
mother
it
was
evident
she
had
no
remembrance
of
either
of
them
for
here
there
was
no
mother
in
her
infancy
she
had
been
carried
off
to
the
desert
and
like
the
daughter
of
seguin
had
forgotten
the
scenes
of
her
childhood
she
had
forgotten
father
mother
all
it
was
as
i
have
said
a
scene
painful
to
witness
the
women
looks
of
anguish
their
passionate
appeals
their
wild
but
affectionate
embraces
lavished
upon
the
girl
their
plaintive
cries
mingled
with
sobs
and
weeping
it
was
indeed
a
painful
scene
it
was
soon
brought
to
a
close
at
least
as
far
as
i
witnessed
it
the
alcalde
came
upon
the
ground
and
the
girl
was
given
in
charge
to
the
policia
until
the
true
mother
should
bring
forward
more
definite
proofs
of
maternity
i
never
heard
the
finale
of
this
little
romance
the
return
of
the
expedition
to
el
paso
was
celebrated
by
a
triumphant
ovation
cannon
boomed
bells
rang
fireworks
hissed
and
sputtered
masses
were
sung
and
music
filled
the
streets
feasting
and
merriment
followed
and
the
night
was
turned
into
a
blazing
illumination
of
wax
candles
and
gran
funcion
de
a
fandango
next
morning
seguin
with
his
wife
and
daughters
made
preparations
to
journey
on
to
the
old
hacienda
on
the
del
norte
the
house
was
still
standing
so
we
had
heard
it
had
not
been
plundered
the
savages
on
taking
possession
of
it
had
been
closely
pressed
by
a
body
of
pasenos
and
had
hurried
off
with
their
captives
leaving
everything
else
as
they
had
found
it
saint
vrain
and
i
were
to
accompany
the
party
to
their
home
the
chief
had
plans
for
the
future
in
which
both
i
and
my
friend
were
interested
there
we
were
to
mature
them
i
found
the
returns
of
my
trading
speculation
even
greater
than
saint
vrain
had
promised
my
ten
thousand
dollars
had
been
trebled
saint
vrain
too
was
master
of
a
large
amount
and
we
were
enabled
to
bestow
our
bounty
on
those
of
our
late
comrades
who
had
proved
themselves
worthy
but
most
of
them
had
received
bounty
from
another
source
as
we
rode
out
from
el
paso
i
chanced
to
look
back
there
was
a
long
string
of
dark
objects
waving
over
the
gates
there
was
no
mistaking
what
they
were
for
they
were
unlike
anything
else
they
were
scalps
chapter
fifty
seven
touching
the
chords
of
memory
it
is
the
second
evening
after
our
arrival
at
the
old
house
on
the
del
norte
we
have
gone
up
to
the
azotea
seguin
saint
vrain
and
myself
i
know
not
why
but
guided
thither
by
our
host
perhaps
he
wishes
to
look
once
more
over
that
wild
land
the
theatre
of
so
many
scenes
in
his
eventful
life
once
more
for
upon
the
morrow
he
leaves
it
for
ever
our
plans
have
been
formed
we
journey
upon
the
morrow
we
are
going
over
the
broad
plains
to
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
they
go
with
us
it
is
a
lovely
evening
and
warm
the
atmosphere
is
elastic
such
an
atmosphere
as
you
can
find
only
on
the
high
tables
of
the
western
world
it
seems
to
act
upon
all
animated
nature
judging
from
its
voices
there
is
joy
in
the
songs
of
the
birds
in
the
humming
of
the
homeward
bees
there
is
a
softness
too
in
those
sounds
that
reach
us
from
the
farther
forest
those
sounds
usually
harsh
the
voices
of
the
wilder
and
fiercer
creatures
of
the
wilderness
all
seem
attuned
to
peace
and
love
the
song
of
the
arriero
is
joyous
for
many
of
these
are
below
packing
for
our
departure
i
too
am
joyous
i
have
been
so
for
days
but
the
light
atmosphere
around
and
the
bright
prospect
before
me
have
heightened
the
pulsations
of
my
happiness
not
so
my
companions
on
the
azotea
both
seem
sad
seguin
is
silent
i
thought
he
had
climbed
up
here
to
take
a
last
look
of
the
fair
valley
not
so
he
paces
backward
and
forward
with
folded
arms
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
cemented
roof
they
see
no
farther
they
see
not
at
all
the
eye
of
his
mind
only
is
active
and
that
is
looking
inward
his
air
is
abstracted
his
brow
is
clouded
his
thoughts
are
gloomy
and
painful
i
know
the
cause
of
all
this
she
is
still
a
stranger
but
saint
vrain
the
witty
the
buoyant
the
sparkling
saint
vrain
what
misfortune
has
befallen
him
what
cloud
is
crossing
the
field
of
his
horoscope
what
reptile
is
gnawing
at
his
heart
that
not
even
the
sparkling
wine
of
el
paso
can
drown
saint
vrain
is
speechless
saint
vrain
is
sighing
saint
vrain
is
sad
i
half
divine
the
cause
saint
vrain
is
the
tread
of
light
feet
upon
the
stone
stairway
the
rustling
of
female
dresses
they
are
ascending
they
are
madame
seguin
adele
zoe
i
look
at
the
mother
at
her
features
they
too
are
shaded
by
a
melancholy
expression
why
is
not
she
happy
why
not
joyous
having
recovered
her
child
ah
she
has
not
yet
recovered
her
i
turn
my
eyes
on
the
daughter
the
elder
one
the
queen
that
is
the
strangest
expression
of
all
have
you
seen
the
captive
ocelot
have
you
seen
the
wild
bird
that
refuses
to
be
tamed
but
against
the
bars
of
its
still
beats
its
bleeding
wings
if
so
it
may
help
you
to
fancy
that
expression
i
can
not
depict
it
she
is
no
longer
in
the
indian
costume
that
has
been
put
aside
she
wears
the
dress
of
civilised
life
but
she
wears
it
reluctantly
she
has
shown
this
for
the
skirt
is
torn
in
several
places
and
the
bodice
plucked
open
displays
her
bosom
heaving
under
the
wild
thoughts
which
agitate
it
she
accompanies
them
but
not
us
a
companion
she
has
the
air
of
a
prisoner
the
air
of
the
eagle
whose
wings
have
been
clipped
she
regards
neither
mother
nor
sister
their
constant
kindness
has
failed
to
impress
her
the
mother
has
led
her
to
the
azotea
and
let
go
her
hand
she
walks
no
longer
with
them
but
crouching
and
in
starts
from
place
to
place
obedient
to
the
impulse
of
strong
emotions
she
has
reached
the
western
wing
of
the
azotea
and
stands
close
up
against
the
parapet
gazing
over
gazing
upon
the
mimbres
she
knows
them
well
those
peaks
of
sparkling
selenite
those
of
the
desert
land
she
knows
them
well
her
heart
is
with
her
eyes
we
stand
watching
her
all
of
us
she
is
the
object
of
common
solicitude
she
it
is
who
keeps
between
all
hearts
and
the
light
the
father
looks
sadly
on
the
mother
looks
sadly
on
zoe
looks
sadly
on
saint
vrain
too
no
that
is
a
different
expression
his
gaze
is
the
gaze
of
she
has
turned
suddenly
she
perceives
that
we
are
all
regarding
her
with
attention
her
eyes
wander
from
one
to
the
other
they
are
fixed
upon
the
glance
of
saint
vrain
a
change
comes
over
her
countenance
a
sudden
change
from
dark
to
bright
like
the
cloud
passing
from
the
sun
her
eye
is
fired
by
a
new
expression
i
know
it
well
i
have
seen
it
before
not
in
her
eyes
but
in
those
that
resemble
them
the
eyes
of
her
sister
i
know
it
well
it
is
the
light
of
love
saint
vrain
his
too
are
lit
by
a
similar
emotion
happy
saint
vrain
happy
that
it
is
mutual
as
yet
he
knows
not
that
but
i
do
i
could
bless
him
with
a
single
word
moments
pass
their
eyes
mingle
in
fiery
communion
they
gaze
into
each
other
neither
can
avert
their
glance
a
god
rules
them
the
god
of
love
the
proud
and
energetic
attitude
of
the
girl
gradually
forsakes
her
her
features
relax
her
eye
swims
with
a
softer
expression
and
her
whole
bearing
seems
to
have
undergone
a
change
she
sinks
down
upon
a
bench
she
leans
against
the
parapet
she
no
longer
turns
to
the
west
she
no
longer
gazes
upon
the
mimbres
her
heart
is
no
longer
in
the
desert
land
no
it
is
with
her
eyes
and
these
rest
almost
continuously
on
saint
vrain
they
wander
at
intervals
over
the
stones
of
the
azotea
then
her
thoughts
do
not
go
with
them
but
they
ever
return
to
the
same
object
to
gaze
upon
it
tenderly
more
tenderly
at
each
new
glance
the
anguish
of
captivity
is
over
she
no
longer
desires
to
escape
there
is
no
prison
where
he
dwells
it
is
now
a
paradise
henceforth
the
doors
may
be
thrown
freely
open
that
little
bird
will
make
no
further
effort
to
fly
from
its
cage
it
is
tamed
what
memory
friendship
entreaties
had
tailed
to
effect
love
had
accomplished
in
a
single
instant
love
mysterious
power
in
one
pulsation
had
transformed
that
wild
heart
had
drawn
it
from
the
desert
i
fancied
that
seguin
had
noticed
all
this
for
he
was
observing
her
movements
with
attention
i
fancied
that
such
thoughts
were
passing
in
his
mind
and
that
they
were
not
unpleasing
to
him
for
he
looked
less
afflicted
than
before
but
i
did
not
continue
to
watch
the
scene
a
deeper
interest
summoned
me
aside
and
obedient
to
the
sweet
impulse
i
strayed
towards
the
southern
angle
of
the
azotea
i
was
not
alone
my
betrothed
was
by
my
side
and
our
hands
like
our
hearts
were
locked
in
each
other
there
was
no
secrecy
about
our
love
with
zoe
there
never
had
been
nature
had
prompted
the
passion
she
knew
not
the
conventionalities
of
the
world
of
society
of
circles
refined
she
knew
not
that
love
was
a
passion
for
one
to
be
ashamed
of
hitherto
no
presence
had
restrained
her
in
its
expression
not
even
that
to
lovers
of
less
pure
design
above
all
others
the
presence
of
the
parents
alone
or
in
their
company
there
was
no
difference
in
her
conduct
she
knew
not
the
hypocrisies
of
artificial
natures
the
restraints
the
intrigues
the
agonies
of
atoms
that
act
she
knew
not
the
terror
of
guilty
minds
she
obeyed
only
the
impulse
her
creator
had
kindled
within
her
with
me
it
was
otherwise
i
had
shouldered
society
though
not
much
then
enough
to
make
me
less
proud
of
love
purity
enough
to
render
me
slightly
sceptical
of
its
sincerity
but
through
her
i
had
now
escaped
from
that
scepticism
i
had
become
a
faithful
believer
in
the
nobility
of
the
passion
our
love
was
sanctioned
by
those
who
alone
possessed
the
right
to
sanction
it
it
was
sanctified
by
its
own
purity
we
are
gazing
upon
a
fair
scene
fairer
now
at
the
sunset
hour
the
sun
is
no
longer
upon
the
stream
but
his
rays
slant
through
the
foliage
of
the
trees
that
fringe
it
and
here
and
there
a
yellow
beam
is
flung
transversely
on
the
water
the
forest
is
dappled
by
the
high
tints
of
autumn
there
are
green
leaves
and
red
ones
some
of
a
golden
colour
and
others
of
dark
maroon
under
this
bright
mosaic
the
river
winds
away
like
a
giant
serpent
hiding
its
head
in
the
darker
woods
around
el
paso
we
command
a
view
of
all
this
for
we
are
above
the
landscape
we
see
the
brown
houses
of
the
village
with
the
shining
vane
of
its
church
our
eyes
have
often
rested
upon
that
vane
in
happy
hours
but
none
happier
than
now
for
our
hearts
are
full
of
happiness
we
talk
of
the
past
as
well
as
the
present
for
zoe
has
now
seen
something
of
life
its
darker
pictures
it
is
true
but
these
are
often
the
most
pleasant
to
be
remembered
and
her
desert
experience
has
furnished
her
with
many
a
new
thought
the
cue
to
many
an
inquiry
the
future
becomes
the
subject
of
our
converse
it
is
all
bright
though
a
long
and
even
perilous
journey
is
before
us
we
think
not
of
that
we
look
beyond
it
to
that
promised
hour
when
i
am
to
teach
and
she
is
to
learn
what
is
to
marry
someone
is
touching
the
strings
of
a
bandolin
we
look
around
madame
seguin
is
seated
upon
a
bench
holding
the
instrument
in
her
hands
she
is
tuning
it
as
yet
she
has
not
played
there
has
been
no
music
since
our
return
it
is
by
seguin
request
that
the
instrument
has
been
brought
up
with
the
music
to
chase
away
heavy
memories
or
perhaps
from
a
hope
that
it
may
soothe
those
savage
ones
still
dwelling
in
the
bosom
of
his
child
madame
seguin
is
about
to
play
and
my
companion
and
i
go
nearer
to
listen
seguin
and
saint
vrain
are
conversing
apart
adele
is
still
seated
where
we
left
her
silent
and
abstracted
the
music
commences
it
is
a
merry
air
a
fandango
one
of
those
to
which
the
andalusian
foot
delights
to
keep
time
seguin
and
saint
vrain
have
turned
we
all
stand
looking
in
the
face
of
adele
we
endeavour
to
read
its
expression
the
first
notes
have
startled
her
from
her
attitude
of
abstraction
her
eyes
wander
from
one
to
the
other
from
the
instrument
to
the
player
with
looks
of
wonder
of
inquiry
the
music
continues
the
girl
has
risen
and
as
it
mechanically
approaches
the
bench
where
her
mother
is
seated
she
crouches
down
by
the
feet
of
the
latter
places
her
ear
close
up
to
the
instrument
and
listens
attentively
there
is
a
singular
expression
upon
her
face
i
look
at
seguin
that
upon
his
is
not
less
singular
his
eye
is
fixed
upon
the
girl
gazing
with
intensity
his
lips
are
apart
yet
he
seems
not
to
breathe
his
arms
hang
neglected
and
he
is
leaning
forward
as
if
to
read
the
thoughts
that
are
passing
within
her
he
starts
erect
again
as
though
under
the
impulse
of
some
sudden
resolution
oh
adele
adele
he
cries
hurriedly
addressing
his
wife
oh
sing
that
song
that
sweet
hymn
you
remember
you
used
to
sing
it
to
her
often
often
you
remember
it
adele
look
at
her
quick
quick
o
god
perhaps
she
may
he
is
interrupted
by
the
music
the
mother
has
caught
his
meaning
and
with
the
adroitness
of
a
practised
player
suddenly
changes
the
tune
to
one
of
a
far
different
character
i
recognise
the
beautiful
spanish
hymn
la
madre
a
su
hija
the
mother
to
her
child
she
sings
it
accompanying
her
voice
with
the
bandolin
she
throws
all
her
energy
into
the
song
until
the
strain
seems
inspired
she
gives
the
words
with
full
and
passionate
effect
tu
duermes
cara
nina
tu
duertnes
en
la
paz
los
angeles
del
cielo
los
angeles
guardan
guardan
nina
mia
ca
ra
mi
the
song
was
interrupted
by
a
cry
a
cry
of
singular
import
uttered
by
the
girl
the
first
words
of
the
hymn
had
caused
her
to
start
and
then
to
listen
if
possible
more
attentively
than
ever
as
the
song
proceeded
the
singular
expression
we
had
noted
seemed
to
become
every
moment
more
marked
and
intense
when
the
voice
had
reached
the
burden
of
the
melody
a
strange
exclamation
escaped
her
lips
and
springing
to
her
feet
she
stood
gazing
wildly
in
the
face
of
the
singer
only
for
a
moment
the
next
moment
she
cried
in
loud
passionate
accents
mamma
mamma
and
fell
forward
upon
the
bosom
of
her
mother
seguin
spoke
truly
when
he
said
perhaps
in
god
mercy
she
may
yet
remember
she
had
remembered
not
only
her
mother
but
in
a
short
time
she
remembered
him
the
chords
of
memory
had
been
touched
its
gates
thrown
open
she
remembered
the
history
of
her
childhood
she
remembered
all
i
will
not
essay
to
describe
the
scene
that
followed
i
will
not
attempt
to
picture
the
expression
of
the
actors
to
speak
of
their
joyous
exclamations
mingled
with
sobs
and
tears
but
they
were
tears
of
joy
all
of
us
were
happy
happy
to
exultation
but
for
seguin
himself
i
knew
it
was
the
hour
of
his
life
c
the
end
