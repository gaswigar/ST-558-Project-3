preface
the
subject
of
the
supernatural
in
modern
english
fiction
has
been
found
difficult
to
deal
with
because
of
its
wealth
of
material
while
there
has
been
no
previous
book
on
the
topic
and
none
related
to
it
save
whitmore
work
on
supernatural
in
the
mass
of
fiction
itself
introducing
ghostly
or
psychic
motifs
is
simply
enormous
it
is
manifestly
impossible
to
discuss
or
even
to
mention
all
of
it
even
in
my
bibliography
which
numbers
over
three
thousand
titles
i
have
made
no
effort
to
list
all
the
available
examples
of
the
type
the
bibliography
which
i
at
first
intended
to
publish
in
connection
with
this
volume
is
far
too
voluminous
to
be
included
here
so
will
probably
be
brought
out
later
by
itself
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
prosecute
the
research
work
or
to
write
the
book
save
for
the
assistance
generously
given
by
many
persons
i
am
indebted
to
the
various
officials
of
the
libraries
of
columbia
university
and
of
new
york
city
particularly
to
miss
isadore
mudge
reference
librarian
of
columbia
and
to
the
authorities
of
the
new
york
society
library
for
permission
to
use
their
priceless
novels
in
the
kennedy
collection
my
interest
in
english
fiction
was
increased
during
my
attendance
on
some
courses
in
the
history
of
the
english
novel
given
by
carlyle
in
oxford

to
all
of
these
and
others
who
have
aided
me
i
am
deeply
grateful
and
i
only
wish
that

the

in

introduction
the
supernatural
is
an
force
in
literature
it
colors
our
poetry
shapes
our
epics
and
dramas
and
fashions
our
prose
till
we
are
so
wonted
to
it
that
we
lose
sense
of
its
wonder
and
magic
if
all
the
elements
of
the
unearthly
were
removed
from
our
books
how
shrunken
in
value
would
seem
the
residue
how
forlorn
our
feelings
lafcadio
hearn
in
the
recently
published
volume
of
says
there
is
scarcely
any
great
author
in
european
literature
old
or
new
who
has
not
distinguished
himself
in
his
treatment
of
the
supernatural
in
english
literature
i
believe
there
is
no
exception
from
the
time
of
the
poets
to
shakespeare
and
from
shakespeare
to
our
own
day
and
this
introduces
us
to
the
consideration
of
a
general
and
remarkable
fact
a
fact
that
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
in
any
books
but
which
is
of
very
great
philosophical
importance
there
is
something
ghostly
in
all
great
art
whether
of
literature
music
sculpture
or
architecture
it
touches
something
within
us
that
relates
to
infinity
the
word
is
used
here
in
its
earlier
sense
signifying
spiritual
this
continuing
presence
of
the
weird
in
literature
shows
the
popular
demand
for
it
and
must
have
some
basis
in
human
psychosis
the
night
side
of
the
soul
attracts
us
all
the
spirit
feeds
on
mystery
it
lives
not
by
fact
alone
but
by
the
unknowable
and
there
is
no
highest
mystery
without
the
supernatural
man
loves
the
frozen
touch
of
fear
and
realizes
pure
terror
only
when
touched
by
the
unmortal
the
hint
of
spectral
sounds
or
presences
quickens
the
imagination
as
no
other
suggestion
can
do
and
no
human
shapes
of
fear
can
awe
the
soul
as
those
from
beyond
the
grave
man
varying
moods
create
heaven
hell
and
faery
for
him
and
people
them
with
strange
beings
man
loves
the
supernatural
elements
in
literature
perhaps
because
they
dignify
him
by
giving
his
existence
a
feeling
of
infinity
otherwise
denied
they
grant
him
a
sense
of
being
the
center
of
powers
more
than
earthly
of
conflicts
supermortal
his
own
material
life
may
be
however
circumscribed
and
trivial
yet
he
can
loose
his
fancy
and
escape
the
petty
tragedies
of
his
days
by
flight
beyond
the
stars
he
can
widen
the
tents
of
his
mortal
life
create
a
universe
for
his
companionship
and
marshal
the
forces
of
demons
and
unknown
gods
for
his
commands
to
his
narrow
rut
he
can
join
the
unspaced
firmament
to
his
trivial
hours
add
eternity
to
his
finite
infinity
he
is
so
greedy
of
power
and
has
so
piteously
little
that
he
must
look
for
his
larger
life
in
dreams
and
in
the
literature
of
the
supernatural
but
whatever
be
the
reasons
there
has
been
a
continuity
of
the
ghostly
in
literature
with
certain
rise
and
fall
of
interest
there
is
in
modern
english
fiction
as
likewise
in
poetry
and
the
drama
a
great
extent
of
the
supernatural
with
wide
diversity
of
elements
beginning
with
the
gothic
romance
that
curious
architectural
excrescence
that
yet
has
had
enormous
influence
on
our
novel
the
supernatural
is
found
in
every
period
and
in
every
form
of
fiction
the
unearthly
beings
meet
us
in
all
guises
and
answer
our
every
mood
whether
it
be
serious
or
awed
satiric
or
humoresque
literature
always
a
little
ahead
of
life
has
formed
our
beliefs
for
us
made
us
free
with
spirits
and
given
us
entrance
to
immortal
countries
the
sense
of
the
unearthly
is
ever
with
us
even
in
the
most
commonplace
situations
and
there
is
nothing
so
natural
to
us
as
the
supernatural
our
imagination
colored
by
our
reading
reveals
and
transforms
the
world
we
live
in
we
are
aware
of
unbodied
emotions
about
us
of
discarnate
moods
that
mock
or
invite
us
we
go
now
in
public
places
and
a
specter
may
glide
up
to
give
us
an
pro
vita
any
day
in
grand
central
or
on
main
street
of
we
chat
with
fetches
across
the
garden
fence
and
pass
the
time
of
day
with
demons
by
way
of
the
that
creature
that
glooms
suddenly
before
us
in
the
winter
street
is
not
a
chauffeur
but
a
questing
for
his
prey
yon
whirring
thing
in
the
far
blue
is
not
an
aeroplane
but
a
hippogriff
that
will
presently
alight
on
the
pavement
beside
us
with
thundering
golden
hoofs
to
bear
us
away
to
distant
lovely
lands
where
we
shall
be
untroubled
by
the
price
of
butter
or
the
articles
lost
in
last
week
that
sedate
ferry
that
transports
us
from
staten
island
is
a
magic
sending
boat
if
only
we
knew
its
potent
runes
the
old
woman
with
the
cheeks
and
glittering
eye
that
presses
august
bargains
upon
us
with
the
argument
that
they
will
be
in
style
for
early
fall
wear
is
a
witch
wishful
to
lure
away
our
souls
we
may
pass
at
will
by
the
guardian
of
the
narrow
gate
and
traverse
the
regions
of
the
true
the
materialist
may
argue
that
the
actual
is
more
marvelous
than
the
imagined
that
the
aeroplane
is
more
a
thing
of
wonder
than
was
the
hippogriff
that
the
ferry
is
really
the
enchanted
boat
after
all
and
that
dante
would
write
a
new
if
he
could
see
the
subway
at
the
rush
hour
but
that
is
another
issue
we
might
have
more
psychal
experiences
than
we
do
if
we
would
only
keep
our
eyes
open
but
most
of
us
do
have
more
than
we
admit
to
the
neighbors
we
have
an
reticence
concerning
ghostly
things
as
if
it
were
scandalous
to
be
associated
with
them
but
that
is
all
wrong
we
should
be
proud
of
being
singled
out
for
spectral
confidences
and
should
report
our
to
the
society
columns
of
the
newspaper
it
is
hoped
that
this
discussion
of
comparative
may
help
to
establish
a
better
sense
of
values
in
this
book
i
deal
with
ghosts
and
devils
by
and
large
in
an
impressionistic
way
i
do
know
much
about
them
i
have
no
learned
theories
of
causation
i
only
love
them
i
only
marvel
at
their
infinite
variety
and
am
touched
by
their
humanity
their
likeness
to
mortals
i
am
fond
of
them
all
even
the
dejected
ghosts
that
look
as
if
they
were
wraiths
of
poor
relations
left
out
in
the
rain
all
night
or
devils
whose
own
mothers
would
care
for
them
it
gives
me
no
feeling
of
horror
to
sit
beside
a
vampire
in
the
subway
no
panic
to
hear
a
banshee
shut
up
in
a
box
i
give
a
cordial
when
a
dragon
glides
up
and
puts
his
paw
in
mine
and
in
every
stray
dog
i
recognize
a
gladsome
beast
like
us
mortals
they
all
need
sympathy
none
more
so
than
the
poor
wizards
and
bogles
that
are
on
their
own
as
the
scotch
say
while
discussing
the
nineteenth
century
as
a
whole
i
have
devoted
more
attention
to
the
fiction
of
the
supernatural
in
the
last
thirty
years
or
so
because
there
has
been
much
more
of
it
in
that
time
than
before
there
is
now
more
interest
in
the
occult
more
literature
produced
dealing
with
psychal
powers
than
ever
before
in
our
history
it
is
apparent
in
poetry
in
the
drama
the
novel
and
the
short
story
i
have
not
attempted
even
in
my
bibliography
to
include
all
the
fiction
of
the
type
since
that
would
be
manifestly
impossible
i
have
however
mentioned
specimens
of
the
various
forms
and
have
listed
the
more
important
examples
the
treatment
here
is
meant
to
be
suggestive
rather
than
exhaustive
and
seeks
to
show
that
there
is
a
genuine
revival
of
wonder
in
our
time
with
certain
changes
in
the
characterization
of
supernatural
beings
it
includes
not
only
the
themes
that
are
strictly
supernatural
but
also
those
which
formerly
considered
unearthly
carry
on
the
traditions
of
the
magical
much
of
our
material
of
the
weird
has
been
rationalized
yet
without
losing
its
effect
of
wonder
for
us
in
fact
or
in
fiction
if
now
we
study
a
science
where
once
men
believed
blindly
in
a
black
art
is
the
result
really
less
mysterious
chapter
i
the
gothic
romance
the
real
precursor
of
supernaturalism
in
modern
english
literature
was
the
gothic
novel
that
odd
form
might
be
called
a
brief
in
behalf
of
banished
romance
since
it
voiced
a
protest
against
the
excess
of
rationalism
and
realism
in
the
early
eighteenth
century
too
great
correctness
and
restraint
must
always
result
in
proportionate
liberty
as
the
eternal
swing
of
the
pendulum
of
literary
history
the
ebb
and
flow
of
fiction
inevitably
bring
a
reaction
against
any
extreme
so
it
was
with
the
fiction
of
the
period
the
mysterious
twilights
of
medievalism
invited
eyes
tired
of
the
noonday
glare
of
augustan
formalism
the
natural
had
become
familiar
to
monotony
hence
men
craved
the
supernatural
and
so
the
gothic
novel
came
into
being
is
here
used
to
designate
the
novel
of
terror
dealing
with
medieval
materials
there
had
been
some
use
of
the
weird
in
english
fiction
before
horace
walpole
but
the
terror
novel
proper
is
generally
conceded
to
begin
with
his
romantic
curiosity
castle
of
the
gothic
novel
marks
a
distinct
change
in
the
form
of
literature
in
which
supernaturalism
manifests
itself
heretofore
the
supernatural
elements
have
appeared
in
the
drama
in
the
epic
in
ballads
and
other
poetry
and
in
but
not
noticeably
in
the
novel
now
however
for
a
considerable
time
the
ghostly
themes
are
most
prominent
in
lengthy
fiction
contrasted
with
the
short
story
which
later
is
to
supersede
it
as
a
vehicle
for
the
weird
this
vacillation
of
form
is
a
distinct
and
interesting
aspect
of
the
development
of
supernaturalism
in
literature
and
will
be
discussed
later
with
this
change
in
form
comes
a
corresponding
change
in
the
materials
of
ghostly
narration
poetry
in
general
in
all
times
has
freely
used
the
various
elements
of
supernaturalism
the
epic
has
certain
distinct
themes
such
as
visits
to
the
lower
world
visions
of
heaven
and
conflict
between
mortal
and
divine
powers
and
brings
in
mythological
characters
gods
goddesses
demigods
and
the
like
fate
is
a
moving
figure
in
the
older
dramas
while
the
liturgical
plays
introduced
devils
angels
and
even
the
deity
as
characters
in
the
action
in
the
classical
and
elizabethan
drama
we
see
ghosts
witches
magicians
as
medieval
romances
prose
as
well
as
metrical
and
alliterative
de
and
so
forth
drew
considerably
on
the
supernatural
for
complicating
material
in
various
forms
and
undoubtedly
much
of
our
present
element
comes
from
medievalism
tales
of
the
celtic
otherworld
of
of
magic
so
popular
in
early
romance
show
a
strong
revival
the
gothic
novel
is
more
closely
related
to
the
drama
than
to
the
epic
or
to
such
poetry
as
faerie
or
on
the
other
hand
the
later
novels
and
stories
while
less
influenced
by
the
dramatic
tradition
show
more
of
the
epic
trace
than
does
the
gothic
romance
the
epic
tours
through
heaven
and
hell
the
lavish
use
of
angels
devils
and
even
of
deity
the
introduction
of
mythological
characters
and
figures
which
are
not
seen
in
gothic
fiction
appear
to
a
considerable
extent
in
the
stories
of
recent
times
in
gothicism
we
find
that
the
deity
disappears
though
the
devil
remains
there
are
no
vampires
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
though
the
and
the
lycanthrope
appear
which
were
absent
from
the
drama
save
in
duchess
of
other
elements
are
seen
such
as
the
beginnings
of
the
scientific
supernaturalism
which
is
to
become
so
prominent
in
later
times
the
wandering
jew
comes
in
and
the
elixir
of
life
and
the
philosopher
stone
achieve
importance
mechanical
supernaturalism
and
the
uncanny
power
given
to
inanimate
objects
seem
to
have
their
origins
here
to
be
greatly
developed
further
on
supernaturalism
associated
with
animals
related
both
to
the
mythological
stories
of
the
past
and
to
the
more
horrific
aspects
of
later
fiction
are
noted
in
the
terror
romance
allegory
and
symbolism
are
present
in
a
slight
degree
as
in
and
vathek
hall
of
eblis
though
not
emphasized
as
in
more
modern
literature
humor
is
largely
lacking
in
the
gothic
romance
save
as
the
writers
furnish
it
unintentionally
in
gothicism
itself
we
have
practically
no
satire
though
jane
austen
and
barrett
satirize
the
terror
novel
itself
in
delicious
burlesques
that
laugh
it
out
of
court
of
in
the
terror
tale
the
relationship
between
supernatural
effect
and
gothic
architecture
scenery
and
weather
is
strongly
stressed
everything
is
ordered
to
fit
the
gothic
plan
and
the
conformity
becomes
in
time
conventionally
monotonous
horace
walpole
the
father
of
the
terror
novel
had
a
fad
for
medievalism
and
he
expressed
his
enthusiasm
in
that
extraordinary
building
at
strawberry
hill
courteously
called
a
gothic
castle
from
a
study
of
gothic
architecture
was
but
a
step
to
the
writing
of
romance
that
should
reproduce
the
mysteries
of
feudal
times
for
the
shadows
of
ancient
gloomy
castles
and
cloisters
suggested
the
shades
of
fiction
of
morbid
terrors
castle
of
was
the
outcome
of
a
dream
suggested
by
the
author
thinking
about
medieval
structures
the
gothic
castle
itself
is
represented
as
possessing
all
the
antique
glooms
that
increase
the
effect
of
mystery
and
awe
and
its
secret
its
underground
vaults
and
dungeons
its
its
mouldy
spectral
chapel
form
a
fit
setting
for
the
unearthly
visitants
that
haunt
it
a
feudal
hall
is
the
suitable
domicile
for
ghosts
and
other
supernatural
revenants
and
the
horrific
romance
throughout
shows
a
close
kinship
with
its
architecture
the
novels
of
the
class
invariably
lay
their
scenes
in

this

is
significant
because
of
the
freedom
with
which
shelley
appropriated
its

of

with

awesome
abbeys
and
whose
titles
show
the
architectural
fiction
that
dominates
them
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
gothic
novels
will
serve
to
show
the
general
importance
laid
on
antique
setting
in
fact
the
castle
abbey
monastery
château
convent
or
inquisition
prison
occupied
such
an
important
place
in
the
story
that
it
seemed
the
leading
character
it
dominated
the
events
and
was
a
malignant
personality
that
laid
its
spell
upon
those
within
its
bounds
it
shows
something
of
the
character
that
hawthorne
finally
gives
to
his
house
of
seven
gables
or
the
brooding
relentless
power
of
the
sea
in
synge
drama
the
ancient
castle
becomes
not
merely
haunted
itself
but
is
the
haunter
as
well
to
the
not
only
is
architecture
made
subservient
to
the
needs
of
gothic
fiction
but
the
scenery
likewise
is
adapted
to
fit
it
before
radcliffe
wrote
her
stories
interlarded
with
nature
descriptions
scant
notice
had
been
paid
to
scenery
in
the
novel
but
she
set
the
style
for
morose
landscapes
as
walpole
had
for
glooming
castles
and
the
succeeding
romances
of
the
combined
both
features
radcliffe
was
not
at
all
hampered
by
the
fact
that
she
had
never
laid
eyes
on
the
scenes
she
so
vividly
pictures
she
painted
the
dread
scenery
of
awesome
mountains
and
forests
beetling
crags
and
dizzy
abysses
with
fluent
and
fervent
adjectives
and
her
successors
imitated
her
in
sketching
nature
with
dark
impressionism
the
scenery
in
general
in
the
gothic
novel
is
always
subjectively
represented
nature
in
itself
and
of
itself
is
not
the
important
thing
what
the
writer
seeks
to
do
is
by
descriptions
of
the
outer
world
to
emphasize
the
mental
states
of
man
to
reflect
the
moods
of
the
characters
and
to
show
a
fitting
background
for
their
crimes
and
unearthly
experiences
there
is
little
of
the
light
of
day
of
the
cheerfulness
of
ordinary
nature
but
only
the
scenes
and
phenomena
that
are
in
harmony
with
the
glooms
of
crimes
and
sufferings
like
the
scenery
the
weather
in
the
gothic
novel
is
always
subjectively
treated
there
is
ever
an
artistic
harmony
between
man
moods
and
the
atmospheric
conditions
the
play
of
lightning
supernatural
thunders
roaring
tempests
announce
the
approach
and
operations
of
the
devil
and
ghosts
walk
to
the
accompaniment
of
presaging
tempests
in
the
winds
are
diabolically
possessed
and
laugh
fiendishly
instead
of
moaning
as
they
do
as
seneschals
in
most
romances
of
terror
the
storms
usually
take
place
at
midnight
and
there
is
rarely
a
peaceful
night
in
gothic
fiction
the
stroke
of
twelve
generally
witnesses
some
uproar
of
nature
as
some
appearance
of
restless
spirit
whenever
the
heroines
in
radcliffe
tales
start
on
their
midnight
ramble
through
subterranean
passages
and
halls
of
horror
the
barometer
becomes
agitated
and
another
says
the
storm
that
at
that
moment
was
tremendous
could
not
equal
that
tempest
which
passed
in
the
thoughts
of
the
unhappy
captive
oswyth
in
victoria
meetings
in
the
forest
with
the
moor
who
is
really
the
devil
in
disguise
are
accompanied
by
supernatural
manifestations
of
nature
the
weather
is
ordered
to
suit
the
dark
unholy
plots
they
make
and
they
plan
murders
against
a
background
of
black
clouds
hellish
thunder
and
lurid
lightning
when
at
last
the
moor
announces
himself
as
the
devil
and
hurls
victoria
from
the
mountain
top
a
sympathetic
storm
arises
and
a
flood
sweeps
her
body
into
the
river
this
scene
is
accusingly
like
the
one
in
the
last
chapter
of
lewis
where
the
devil
throws
ambrosio
from
the
cliff
to
the
river
brink
instantly
a
violent
storm
arose
the
winds
in
fury
rent
up
rocks
and
forests
the
sky
was
now
black
with
clouds
now
sheeted
with
fire
the
rain
fell
in
torrents
it
swelled
the
stream
the
waves
their
banks
they
reached
the
spot
where
ambrosio
lay
and
when
they
abated
carried
with
them
into
the
river
the
corse
of
the
despairing
monk
no
gothic
writer
shows
more
power
of
harmonizing
the
tempests
of
the
soul
with
the
outer
storms
than
does
charles
robert
maturin
as
melmoth
doomed
to
dreadful
life
till
he
can
find
some
tortured
soul
willing
to
exchange
destinies
with
him
traverses
the
earth
in
his
search
the
preternatural
aspects
of
weather
both
reflect
and
mock
his
despair
as
the
young
nephew
alone
at
midnight
after
his
death
reads
the
fated
manuscript
cloud
after
cloud
comes
sweeping
on
like
the
dark
banners
of
an
approaching
host
whose
march
is
for
destruction
other
references
may
illustrate
the
motif
clouds
go
portentously
off
like
ships
of
war
to
return
with
added
strength
and
fury
the
dark
and
heavy
that
advance
slowly
seem
like
the
shrouds
of
specters
of
departed
greatness
peals
of
thunder
sounded
every
peal
like
the
exhausted
murmurs
of
a
spent
heart
in
the
and
in
general
in
the
gothic
novel
there
is
a
decided
and
definite
attempt
to
use
the
terrible
forces
of
nature
to
reflect
the
dark
passions
of
man
with
added
suggestiveness
where
supernatural
agencies
are
at
work
in
the
events
this
becomes
a
distinct
convention
used
with
varying
effectiveness
nowhere
in
the
fiction
of
the
period
is
there
the
power
such
as
shakespeare
reveals
as
where
lear
wanders
on
the
heath
in
the
pitiless
clutch
of
the
storm
with
a
more
tragic
tempest
in
his
soul
yet
although
the
idea
of
the
of
the
passions
of
man
and
nature
is
not
original
with
the
gothicists
and
though
they
show
little
of
the
inevitability
of
genius
they
add
greatly
to
their
supernatural
effect
by
this
method
later
fiction
is
less
barometric
as
less
architectural
than
the
gothic
origin
of
individual
gothic
the
psychological
origin
of
the
individual
gothic
romances
is
interesting
to
note
supernaturalism
was
probably
more
generally
believed
in
then
than
now
and
people
were
more
given
to
the
telling
of
ghost
stories
and
all
the
of
terror
than
at
the
present
time
one
reason
for
this
may
be
that
they
had
more
leisure
and
their
great
open
fires
were
more
conducive
to
the
retailing
of
romances
of
shudders
than
our
unsocial
steam
radiators
the
eighteenth
century
seemed
frankly
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
fear
and
the
rise
of
the
gothic
novel
gave
rein
to
this
natural
love
for
the
uncanny
and
the
gruesome
dreams
played
an
important
part
in
the
inspiration
of
the
tales
of
terror
the
initial
romance
was
as
the
author
tells
us
the
result
of
an
architectural
nightmare
walpole
says
in
a
letter
shall
i
even
confess
to
you
what
was
the
origin
of
this
romance
i
waked
one
morning
from
a
dream
of
which
all
that
i
could
recall
was
that
i
had
thought
myself
in
an
ancient
castle
a
very
natural
dream
for
a
head
filled
like
mine
with
gothic
story
and
that
at
the
uppermost
banister
of
a
great
staircase
i
saw
a
gigantic
hand
in
armor
in
the
evening
i
sat
down
and
began
to
write
without
knowing
in
the
least
what
i
intended
to
say
or
relate
the
work
grew
on
my
hands
mary
shelley
was
likewise
born
of
a
dream
monk
lewis
had
interested
byron
polidori
and
the
shelleys
in
supernatural
tales
so
much
so
that
after
a
fireside
recital
of
german
terror
stories
byron
proposed
that
each
member
of
the
group
should
write
a
ghostly
romance
to
be
compared
with
the
compositions
of
the
others
the
results
were
negligible
save
and
it
is
said
that
byron
was
much
annoyed
that
a
mere
girl
should
excel
him
at
first
shelley
was
unable
to
hit
upon
a
plot
but
one
evening
after
hearing
a
discussion
of
erasmus
darwin
attempts
to
create
life
by
laboratory
experiments
she
had
an
idea
in
a
half
waking
dream
she
says
i
saw
with
shut
eyes
but
acute
mental
vision
i
saw
the
pale
student
of
unhallowed
arts
kneeling
beside
the
thing
he
had
put
together
i
saw
the
hideous
phantasm
of
a
man
stretched
out
and
then
on
the
working
of
some
powerful
engine
show
signs
of
life
the
artist
sleeps
but
he
is
awakened
and
behold
the
horrid
thing
stands
at
his
bedside
looking
on
him
with
watery
yellow
yet
speculative
eyes
and
from
this
she
wrote
her
story
of
the
the
relation
of
dreams
to
the
uncanny
tale
is
interesting
dreams
and
visions
revelatory
of
the
past
and
prophetic
of
the
future
played
an
important
part
in
the
drama
as
they
are
now
widely
used
in
scenarios
and
the
gothic
novel
continues
the
tradition
it
would
be
impossible
to
discover
in
how
many
instances
the
authors
were
subconsciously
influenced
in
their
choice
of
material
by
dreams
the
presaging
dreams
and
visions
attributed
to
supernatural
agency
appear
frequently
in
gothic
fiction
the
close
relation
between
dreams
and
second
sight
in
the
terror
novel
might
form
an
interesting
for
investigation
becomes
even
more
prominent
in
later
fiction
and
contributes
passages
of
extraordinary
power
of
which
de
quincey
may
be
mentioned
as
an
example
the
germinal
idea
for
the
was
contained
in
a
paragraph
from
one
of
the
author
own
sermons
which
suggested
a
theme
for
the
story
of
a
doomed
soul
at
this
moment
is
there
one
of
us
present
however
we
may
have
departed
from
the
lord
disobeyed
his
will
and
disregarded
his
word
is
there
one
of
us
who
would
at
this
moment
accept
all
that
man
could
bestow
or
earth
could
afford
to
resign
the
hope
of
his
salvation
no
there
is
not
one
not
such
a
fool
on
earth
were
the
enemy
of
mankind
to
traverse
it
with
the
offer
true
the
theme
of
such
had
appeared
in
and
in
the
drama
previously
notably
in
marlowe
but
maturin
here
gives
the
idea
a
dramatic
twist
and
psychologic
poignancy
by
making
a
human
being
the
one
to
seek
to
buy
another
soul
to
save
his
own
a
mortal
cursed
with
physical
immortality
ceaselessly
harried
across
the
world
by
the
hounds
of
fate
forever
forced
by
an
irresistible
urge
to
make
his
impitiable
offer
to
tormented
souls
and
always
meeting
a
tragic
refusal
offers
dramatic
possibilities
of
a
high
order
and
maturin
story
has
a
dreadful
power
clara
reeve
avowed
purpose
in
writing
old
english
was
to
produce
a
ghost
story
that
should
be
more
probable
and
realistic
than
walpole
she
stated
that
her
book
was
the
literary
offspring
of
the
earlier
romance
though
walpole
disclaimed
the
paternity
she
deplored
the
violence
of
the
supernatural
machinery
that
tended
to
defeat
its
own
impressiveness
and
wished
to
avoid
that
danger
in
her
work
though
she
announced
we
can
conceive
and
allow
for
the
appearance
of
a
ghost
her
prim
recipe
for
romantic
fiction
required
a
certain
degree
of
the
marvelous
to
excite
the
attention
enough
of
the
manners
of
real
life
to
give
an
air
of
probability
to
the
work
and
enough
of
the
pathetic
to
engage
the
heart
in
its
behalf
but
her
ingredients
did
not
mix
well
and
the
result
was
rather
indigestible
though
devoured
by
hungry
readers
of
her
time
anne
radcliffe
that
energetic
manipulator
of
gothic
enginery
wrote
because
she
had
time
that
was
wasting
on
her
hands
which
may
be
an
explanation
for
other
and
later
literary
attempts
her
journalist
husband
was
away
till
late
at
night
so
while
sitting
up
for
him
she
wrote
frightful
stories
to
keep
herself
from
being
scared
during
that
waiting
loneliness
she
doubtless
experienced
all
those
nervous
terrors
that
she
describes
as
being
undergone
by
her
palpitating
maidens
whose
emotional
anguish
is
suffered
in
midnight
wanderings
through
subterranean
passages
and
ghosted
apartments
there
is
one
report
that
she
went
mad
from
brooding
on
mormo
but
that
is
generally
discredited
matthew
gregory
lewis
was
impelled
to
write
by
reading
the
romances
of
walpole
and
radcliffe
together
with
which
triple
influence
is
discernible
in
his
lurid
tale
he
defended
the
indecency
of
his
book
by
asserting
that
he
took
the
plot
from
a
story
in
ingeniously
intimating
that
plagiarized
immorality
is
less
reprehensible
than
original
material
shelley
in
his
turn
was
so
strongly
impressed
by
lewis
and
dacre
in
writing
his
and
by
william
godwin
in
his
irvyne
or
the
that
the
adaptation
amounts
to
actual
plagiarism
even
the
titles
show
imitation
in
writing
to
godwin
shelley
said
he
was
in
a
state
of
intellectual
sickness
when
he
wrote
these
stories
and
no
one
who
is
familiar
with
the
productions
will
contradict
him
in
the
matter
the
history
of

barsis
number
the
influence
of
the
crude
scientific
thought
and
investigation
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
apparent
in
the
gothic
novels
as
we
have
seen
was
the
outcome
of
a
romantic
darwinian
dream
and
novels
by
godwin
shelley
and
maturin
deal
with
the
theme
of
the
elixir
of
life
william
beckford
has
to
do
with
alchemy
sorcery
and
other
phases
of
supernatural
science
zofloya
dacre
diabolical
moor
performs
experiments
in
hypnotism
telepathy
sorcery
and
satanic
chemistry
and
so
in
a
number
of
the
imitative
and
less
known
novels
of
the
science
plays
a
part
in
furnishing
the
material
there
is
much
interest
in
the
study
of
the
relation
of
science
to
the
literature
of
supernaturalism
in
the
various
periods
and
the
discoveries
of
modern
times
as
furnishing
plot
material
the
gothic
contribution
to
this
form
of
ghostly
fiction
is
significant
though
slight
in
comparison
with
later
developments
gothic
the
ghost
is
the
real
hero
or
heroine
of
the
gothic
novel
the
merely
human
characters
become
for
the
reader
colorless
and
dull
the
moment
a
specter
glides
up
and
indicates
a
willingness
to
relate
the
story
of
his
life
the
continuing
popularity
of
the
shade
in
literature
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
humanity
finds
fear
one
of
the
most
pleasurable
of
emotions
and
truly
enjoys
vicarious
horrors
or
it
may
be
due
to
a
childish
delight
in
the
sensational
at
all
events
the
ghost
haunts
the
pages
of
terror
fiction
and
the
trail
of
the
supernatural
is
over
them
all
in
addition
to
its
association
with
ancient
superstitions
survivals
of
animistic
ideas
in
primitive
culture
we
may
see
the
classical
and
elizabethan
influence
in
the
gothic
specter
the
naturally
is
not
needed
in
fiction
but
the
is
as
prominent
as
ever
the
ghost
as
a
dramatic
personage
his
talkativeness
his
share
in
the
action
reflect
the
dramatic
tradition
with
a
strong
senecan
touch
the
gothic
phantoms
have
not
the
power
of
shakespeare
apparitions
nothing
approaching
the
psychologic
subtlety
of
or
or
the
horrific
suggestiveness
of
yet
they
are
related
to
them
and
are
not
altogether
poor
though
imitative
of
the
dramatic
ghosts
they
have
certain
characteristics
peculiar
to
themselves
and
are
greatly
worth
consideration
in
a
study
of
literary
supernaturalism
there
are
several
clearly
marked
classes
of
ghosts
in
gothicism
there
is
the
real
ghost
that
anybody
can
pin
faith
to
there
is
the
imagined
apparition
that
is
only
a
figment
of
hysterical
fear
or
of
a
guilty
conscience
and
there
is
the
deliberate
hoax
specter
there
are
ghosts
that
come
only
when
called
sometimes
the
castle
dungeons
have
to
be
paged
for
retiring
shades
others
appear
of
their
own
free
will
some
have
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
and
haunt
only
their
own
proper
premises
while
others
have
the
wanderlust
there
are
innocent
spirits
returning
to
reveal
the
circumstances
of
their
violent
demise
and
to
ask
christian
burial
we
meet
guilty
souls
sent
back
to
do
penance
for
their
sins
in
the
place
of
their
commission
and
there
are
revenge
ghosts
of
multiple
variety
there
are
specters
that
yield
to
prayers
and
shades
that
resist
exorcism
it
is
difficult
to
classify
them
for
the
lines
cross
inextricably
the
genealogical
founder
of
the
family
of
gothic
ghosts
is
the
giant
apparition
in
castle
of
he
heralds
his
coming
by
an
enormous
helmet
a
hundred
times
larger
than
life
size
which
crashes
into
the
hall
and
a
sword
which
requires
a
hundred
men
to
bear
it
in
the
ghost
himself
appears
in
sections
we
first
see
a
brobdignagian
foot
and
leg
with
no
body
then
a
few
chapters
later
an
enormous
hand
to
match
in
the
last
scene
he
assembles
his
parts
after
the
fashion
of
an
automobile
demonstration
supplies
the
limbs
that
are
lacking
and
stands
forth
as
an
imposing
and
portentous
shade

be

as
the

seems
singular
considering
the

in

somewhat
similar
instance
occurs
in

stories
of
dead
bodies
there
is
some
attempt
to
exorcise
restless
spirits

novels

various
occasions
the

come
forth

of

writers
lack
the
courage

for
instance
loves
to
build
up
a
tissue
of
ghostly
horrors

them
away

grounds

he

corner
the
ghosts
that
are
deliberately
got
up
for
the
purposes
of
deception
form
an
interesting
feature
of
gothic
methods
the
reasons
behind
the
spectral
impersonations
are
various
to
frighten
criminals
into
restitution
after
confession
to
further
crime

merely
to
enliven

otherwise
lagging

they

in

there

various
spectral
frauds

they
make
the

place
haunting
its

a
familiar
figure
in
the
fiction
of
the
period
every
castle
has
its
haunted
tower

dungeon
or
apartment
with
its
shade
that
walks
by
night
several
appear
carrying
candles

lamps
to

through
the
blackness
of
architectural
labyrinths
several
evince
a
fondness
for
bells
and
herald
their
coming
by
rings
in
one
romance
the
ghost
takes
the
form
of
a

cow

many
ghosts
in

have
had

it
would
be
impossible
to
designate
all
the
ghosts

fiction
for
there
is
wholesale
haunting
they
appear
in
the
plot
to
warn
to
comfort
or
command
and
seem
to
have
very
human
characteristics
on
the
whole
yet
they
are
not
so
definitely
personated
not
so
individual
and
realistic
as
the
spirits
in
later
fiction
though
they
do
achieve
some
creepy
effects
it
is
not
their
brute
force
that
impresses
us
we
are
less
moved
by
the
armored
knight
and
the
titanic
adversary
in
otranto
than
by
the
phantoms
in
the
hall
of
eblis
the
vindictive
ghosts

vault
are
less
appalling
than
the
bodiless
voices
of
wronged
women
and
children
that
haunt

corpse
back
to
dreadful
life
the
specters

flamboyant
personality
that
oppress
us
with
their
egotistic
clamor
may
be
soon
forgotten
but
the
ghostly
suggestiveness
of
other
spirits
has
a
haunting
power
that
is
inescapable
some
of
the
gothic
ghosts
have
a
strange
vitality

their
early
services

the
excitement
in

there
is

little
change

influence
of
the
dramatic
rather
than
of
the
epic
tradition
he
is
akin
to
calderon
magician
and
marlowe
faustus
rather
than
to
the
satanic
creations
of
dante
and
milton
he
is
not
a
dread
figure
either
physically
or
as
a
personality
though
he
does
assume
terrifying
almost
epic
proportions
in
the
closing
scenes
of
and
neither
is
he
as
human
as
appealing
to
our
sympathies
as
the
lonely
misjudged
misunderstood
devils
in
later
fiction
we
neither
love
nor
greatly
fear
the
gothic
demon
yet
he
does
appear
in
interesting
variants
and
deserves
our
study
in
hogg
of
the
devil
comes
in
as
a
strange
old
man
who
yet
seems
curiously
familiar
to
the
king
and
to
everyone
who
sees
him
though
no
one
can
remember
just
when
he
knew
him
there
is
a
clever
psychologic
suggestiveness
here
which
perhaps
inspired
a
similar
idea
in
a
recent
play
eternal
later
he
is
recognized
and
holy
water
thrown
on
him
the
whole
form
and
visage
of
the
creature
was
changed
in
a
moment
to
that
of
a
furious
fiend
he
uttered
a
yell
that
made
all
the
abbey
shake
to
its
foundations
and
forthwith
darted
away
into
the
air
wrapt
in
flames
as
he
ascended
he
waved
his
right
hand
and
shook
his
fiery
locks
at
his
inquisitors
there
is
nothing
dubious
about
his
personality
here
certainly
satan
appears
dramatically
in
as
well
his
first
visits
are
made
in
the
form
of
attractive
youth
ambrosio
who
has
been
led
into
sin
by
the
dæmonic
agent
matilda
is
awaiting
death
in

inquisition
cell
when
she
comes
to
see
him
to
urge
that
he
win
release
by
selling
his
soul
to
the
devil
but
the
repentant
monk
refuses
her
advice
so
she
departs
in
a
temper
of
blue
flame

he
has
a
more
dread
visitant

the
marks
of

almighty
thunders
a
swarthy
darkness

itself
over
his
gigantic
form
his
hands
and
feet
were
armed
with
long
talons
over
his
huge
shoulders
waved
two
enormous
sable
wings
and
his
hair
was
supplied
by
living
snakes
which
twined
themselves
with
frightful
hissings
in
one
hand
he
held
a
roll
of
parchment
and
in
the
other
an
iron
pen
still
the
lightnings
flashed
around
him
and
the
thunder
bursts
seemed
to
announce
the
dissolution
of
nature
ambrosio
is
overawed
into
selling
his
soul
and
signs
the
compact
with
his
blood
as
per
convention
the
devil
does
keep
to
his
agreement
to
release
him
however
for
lewis
tells
us
that
taking
his
victim
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
darting
his
talons
into
the
monk
shaven
crown
he
sprang
with
him
from

rock

to
soar
aloft

reaching
a
dreadful
height
he
released

sufferer
headlong

plunges
to
the
river
brink
after
which
a
storm
is

away
in

herself
to

he
grants

wishes
hostile
to
her
enemies
holding
many
conferences
with
her
in
the
dark
forest
where
he
is
heralded
by
sounds
he
appears
sometimes
like
a
flame
sometimes
like

lightning
flash
he
comes
with
the
swiftness
of
the
wind
and
tells
her
that
her

announces
himself

not
the

either

the

supernaturalism
in
the

is
by
no
means
confined
to

beings

extends
to
beasts
as
well
animals
are
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
sensitive
to
ghostly
impressions
more
so
than

announced
by

mary
shelley
uses
the
idea
of

biology
in
her
story
of
the
the
story
of
the
young
scientist
who
after
morbid
study
and
experiment
constructs
a
human
frame
of
supernatural
size
and
hideous
grotesqueness
and
gives
it
life
but
the
thing
created
appalls
its
creator
by
its
dreadful
visage
its
more
than
human
size
its
look
of
less
than
human
intelligence
and
the
student
flees
in
horror
from
the
sight
of
it
shelley
describes
the
emotions
of
the
lonely
tragic
thing
thrust
suddenly
into
a
world
that
ever
recoils
shuddering
from
it
she
reveals
the
slow
hate
distilled
in
its
heart
because
of
the
harsh
treatment
it
meets
till
at
last
it
takes
diabolic
revenge
not
only
on
the
man
who
has
created
it
but
on
all
held
dear
by
him
the
struggles
that
rend
his
soul
between
hate
and
remorse
are
impressive
the
wretched
being
weeps
in
an
agony
of
grief
as
it
stands
over
the
body
of
frankenstein
whom
it
has
harried
to
death
then
goes
away
to
its
own
doom
the
last
sight
of
it
as
the
first
is
effective
as
in
tragic
solitude
towering
on
the
it
moves
toward
the
desolate
north
to
its
death
in
the
characterization
of
this
being
as
in
the
unusual
conception
shelley
has
introduced
something
poignantly
new
in
fiction
it
was
a
startling
theme
for
the
mind
of
a
young
girl
as
were
and
for
youths
of
twenty
years
and
only
the
abnormal
psychological
conditions
she
went
through
could
have
produced
it
there
is
more
curdling
awfulness
in
frankenstein
monster
than
in
the
museum
of
armored
ghosts
bleeding
nuns
and
accompanying
horrors
of
the
early
gothic
novels
the
employment
of
the
frankenstein
motif
in
a
play
produced
recently
in
new
york
illustrates
anew
the
vitality
of
the
idea
last
the
search
for
the
philosopher
stone
appears
in
various
novels
of
the
period
by
william
godwin
relates
the
story
of
a
man
who
knew
how
to
produce
unlimited
gold
by
a
secret
formula
given
him
by
a
mysterious
stranger
who
dies
in
his
home
shelley
brings
in
this
power
incidentally
with
the
gift
of
endless
life
there
is
an
use
of
ventriloquism
in
charles
brockden
novel
while
gives
a
study
in
somnambulism
suggests
hypnotism
or
mesmerism
by
saying
that
thought
summoned
the
moor
to
her
that
they
could
have
brought
him
had
he
been
at
the
further
extremity
of
this
terrestrial
globe
this
seems
a
faint
foreshadowing
of
ibsen
idea
in
the
these
may
illustrate
the
use
of
science
in
gothicism
in
the
elixir
of
life
is
brewed
in
divers
gothic
novels
dramatic
and
intense
as
are
the
psychological
experiences
connected
with
the
discovery
of
the
magic
potion
the
effects
of
the
success
are
more
poignant
still
the
thought
that
endless
mortality
life
that
may
not
be
laid
down
becomes
a
burden
intolerable
has
appeared
in
fiction
since
swift
account
of
the
struldbrugs
and
perhaps
before
is
a
story
of
the
secret
of
perpetual
life
the
tiresome
godwinistic
hero
is
visited
by
a
decrepit
old
man
who
wishes
to
tell
him
on
a
pledge
of
incommunicability
what
will
give
him
the
power
of
endless
life
and
boundless
wealth
the
impoverished
nobleman
accepts
with
consequences
less
enjoyable
than
he
has
anticipated
shelley
hectic
romance
whose
idea
as
shelley
admitted
to
stockdale
came
from
godwin
book
uses
the
same
theme
the
young
student
with
burning
eyes
who
has
discovered
the
elixir
of
life
may
be
compared
with
mary
shelley
later
picture
of
frankenstein
events
are
rather
confused
here
as
the
villain
falls
dead
in
the
presence
of
the
devil
but
comes
to
life
again
as
another
character
later
in
the
story
shelley
informing
us
of
their
identity
but
not
troubling
to
explain
it
irvyne
or
the
the
most
impressive
instance
of
the
theme
of
fleshly
immortality
in
the
early
novels
is
found
in
here
the
mysterious
wanderer
possesses
the
power
of
endless
life
but
not
the
right
to
lay
it
down
when
existence
becomes
a
burden
melmoth
can
win
the
boon
of
death
only
if
he
can
find
another
mortal
willing
to
change
destinies
with
him
at
the
price
of
his
soul
he
traverses
the
world
in
his
search
and
offers
the
exchange
to
persons
in
direst
need
and
suffering
the
extreme
torments
offering
to
give
them
wealth
as
well
as
life
eternal
yet
no
man
nor
woman
will
buy
life
at
the
price
of
the
soul
to
gothic
certain
themes
appear
recurringly
as
first
aids
to
terror
fiction
some
of
them
are
found
equally
in
later
literature
while
others
belong
more
particularly
to
the
gothic
an
interesting
aspect
of
the
supernatural
visitants
is
gigantism
or
the
superhuman
size
which
they
assume
in
castle
of
the
sensational
ghost
is
of
enormous
size
and
his
accouterments
are
colossal
in
the
last
scene
he
is
astounding
a
clap
of
thunder
shook
the
castle
to
its
foundations
the
earth
rocked
and
the
clank
of
more
than
mortal
armor
was
heard
behind
the
walls
of
the
castle
behind
manfred
were
thrown
down
with
a
mighty
force
and
the
form
of
alfonso
dilated
to
an
immense
magnitude
appeared
in
the
center
of
the
ruins
behold
the
true
heir
of
alfonso
said
the
vision
this
reminds
one
of
an
incident
in
marion
crawford
where
the
indian
magician
expands
to
awful
size
miraculously
draws
down
a
mist
and
wraps
it
round
him
as
a
cloak
zofloya
is
frequently
spoken
of
as
immense
and
it
is
said
that
common
objects
seem
to
sink
in
his
presence
in
the
last
scene
the
wicked
victoria
sees
the
moor
change
from
a
handsome
youth
to
a
fierce
gigantic
figure
a
diabolic
apparition
eight
or
nine
feet
high
pursues
a
monk
and
the
knight
engages
in
combat
with
a
dæmonic
giant
who
slays
him
the
devil
in
is
represented
as
being
of
enormous
stature
and
much
of
the
horror
excited
by
the
that
frankenstein
created
arises
from
the
creature
superhuman
size
in
most
cases
gigantism
connotes
evil
power
and
rouses
a
supernatural
awe
in
the
beholder
the
giant
is
an
oriental
figure
and
appears
in
along
with
genii
dwarfs
and
kindred
personages
but
the
gothic
giant
has
more
diabolism
than
the
mere
oriental
original
he
seems
to
fade
out
from
fiction
appearing
only
occasionally
in
later
stories
while
he
has
practically
no
place
in
the
drama
owing
doubtless
to
the
difficulties
of
stage
presentation
in
spirit
of
the
in
spirit
of
insanity
as
contributing
to
the
effect
of
supernaturalism
affords
many
gruesome
studies
in
psychiatry
madness
seems
a
special
curse
of
the
gods
or
torment
from
the
devil
and
various
instances
of
its
use
occur
in
gothic
fiction
the
devil
in
at
victoria
request
gives
henrique
an
enchanted
drug
which
renders
him
temporarily
insane
during
which
time
he
marries

her
to

drives
him

in

the
joy
of

she
sings
wild
unearthly
songs
and
talks
deliriously
of
incomprehensible
things
of
devilish
struggles
melmoth
uses
the
idea
with
special
effectiveness
the
insanity
of
the
young
husband
whose
bride
is
mysteriously
slain
on
their
wedding
day
by
the
supernatural
power
accompanying
melmoth
may
be
compared
with
the
madness
of
the
wife
in
scott
of
maturin
also
shows
us
a
scene
in
a
where
a
sane
man
stanton
is
confined
whom
melmoth
visits
to
offer
exchange
of
destinies
melmoth
taunts
him
cruelly
with
his
hopeless
situation
and
prophecies
that
he
too
will
go
mad
from
despair
we
hear
stanton
wild
cry
echoed
by
a
hundred
yells
like
those
of
demons
but
the
others
are
stilled
when
the
mad

her
lamentation

all
in
the
great
london
fire
at
her
appalling
shrieks
all
other
voices
are
hushed
another
impressive
figure
in
the
is
the
preacher
who
thinks
himself
a
demon
and
alternately
prays
and
blasphemes
the
lord
charles
brockden
brown
rivals
maturin
in
his
terrible
use
of
insanity
for
supernatural
effect
the
demented
murderer
in
gives
an
impression
of
mystery
and
awe
that
is
unusual
while
with
its
religious
mania
produced
by
diabolic
ventriloquism
is
even
more
impressive
brown
knew
the
effect
of
mystery
and
dread
on
the
human
mind
and
by
slow
cumulative
suggestion
he
makes
us
feel
a
creeping
awe
that
the
unwieldy
machinery
of
pure
gothicism
never
could
achieve
in
studies
of
the
morbid
mentality
he
has
few
equals
for
psychologic
subtlety
for
haunting
horror
what
is
a
crashing
helmet
or
a
dismembered
ghost
compared
with
brown
wieland
what
are
the
rackings
of
monkish
vindictiveness
when
set
against
the
agonies
of
an
unbalanced
mind
turned
in
upon
itself
what
exterior
torture
could
so
appeal
to
our
sympathies
as
wieland
despair
when
racked
with
religious
mania
he
feels
the
overwhelming
conviction
that
the
voice
of
god
which
is
but
the
fiendish
trick
of
a
ventriloquist
is
calling
him
to
murder
his
wife
and
children
as
a
sacrifice
to
deity
such
a
tragedy
of
dethroned
reason
is
intolerably
powerful
the
dark
labyrinths
of
insanity
the
passages
of
the
human
mind
are
more
terrible
to
traverse
than
the
midnight
windings
of
gothic
dungeons
we
feel
that
here
is
a
man
who
is
real
who
is
human
and
suffering
the
extremity
of
anguish
perhaps
the
most
hideous
aspect
of
insanity
in
the
terror
novel
is
that
of
the
lycanthrope
in
the
tragic
imagines
himself
to
be
a
mad
wolf
and
cowers
in
his
lair
glaring
with
gleaming
awful
eyes
at
all
who
approach
him
gnawing
at
a
human
head
snatched
from
the
graveyard
there
are
various
other
uses
of
insanity
in
the
novel
of
the
period
but
these
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
relation
between
insanity
and
the
supernatural
has
been
marked
in
later
literature
the
use
of
portents
is
a
distinct
characteristic
of
the
horror
romance
calamity
is
generally
preceded
by
some
sign
of
the
supernatural
influence
at
work
some
presentment
of
dread
crime
and
catastrophe

forefelt
by
premonition
of

and
accompaniment
of
horror

supernatural
thunder

the
discovery
of
the

in
its
and
the

says
yes
some
dread
discovery
is
at

these
phenomena
are
miraculous
when
the
common
laws
of
nature
are
violated
the
awful
portents
are
not
sent
in

in
romance
of

my

with
the
vision
which
revealed
his
date
of
death
to
amos
judd
in
james

novel
of
that

and
to
the

in

of

three
times
on

away
as

at

of
the
true
heir
to
the
estate
from
which
he
has
been
kept
by
fraud
in

the
doors
of
the
ancient
castle
fly
open
upon
which
the

cry

themselves
to
receive
their

when
usurping
manfred
sees
the

on
the
miraculous

shaken
in

with
the
brazen
trumpet
he
exclaims
what
mean
these
portents
if
i
have
offended
at
this
point
the
plumes
are
shaken
still
more
strenuously
and
the
helmet
is
equally
agitated
when
the
great
sword
leaps
in
manfred
cries
to
the
apparition
if
thou
art
a
true
knight
thou
wilt
scorn

manfred
trusts
to
righteousness
to
protect
his
cause
but
the
omens
bring
bad
luck
to
manfred
by
proby
there
is
much
use
of
portent
in
the
specter
of
the
wanderer
appearing
just
before
the
old
man
death
predicts
the
spiritual
doom
of
the
dying
as
the
old

almost
breathing
his

here
at
which
the

the

is
a
walking
portent
of
evil

bread
turns
viperous
when
he
is
there
and
the

falls
dead
in
the
attempt
to
exorcise
the
fiendish

mysterious
strains
of
music
sound
as
heralds
of
disaster
in
several
gothic
novels
as
where
the
inexplicable
strains
are
heard
only
by
the
bride
and
groom
preceding
the
strange
tragedy
that
befalls
them
in
at
the
approach
of
a
supernatural
visitant
in
the
terror
novel
the
fire
always
burns
blue
where
there
is
a
fire
and
the
great
hearth
usually
affords
ample
opportunity
for
such
portentous
blaze
the
thermometer
itself
tends
to
take
a
downward
path
when
a
ghost
draws
near
the
three
drops
of
blood
shed
from
the
statue
nose
in
while
ridiculed
by
the
critics
are
meant
simply
as
a
portent
of
evil
william
lyon
phelps
points
out
that
the
idea
did
not
originate
with
walpole
but
was
familiar
as
a
superstition
regarding
premonition
of
ill
as
referred
to
in
dryden
this
instance
may
be
compared
with
the
much
more
skillfully
handled
omens
in
later
drama
as
maeterlinck
and
ibsen
particularly
in
emperor
and
various
other
portents
of
ill
appear
in
gothic
fiction
in
his
of
the
english
romantic
eliza
heywood
romance
or
the
shows
a
similar
portent
as
george
frisbee
whicher
notes
in
his
life
and
romances
of
eliza
professor
ashley
thorndike
in
his
in
speaking
of
the
plays
of
the
restoration
dramatist
john
banks
says
even
the
portents
are
reduced
to
a
peculiar
decorum
last
night
no
sooner
was
i
laid
to
rest
than
just
three
drops
of
blood
fell
from
my
nose
these
three
drops
of
blood
probably
have
a
much
more
extended
history
in
romance
and
the
drama
which
it
would
be
interesting
to
trace
out
the
symbols
of
dread
and
the
ghostly
are
used
to
good
effect
in
the
terror
romance
the
cumulative
effects
of
supernatural
awe
are
carefully
built
up
by
the
use
of
gruesome
accompaniments
and
suggestions
the
triple
veil
of
night
desolation
and
silence
usually
hangs
over
the
haunter
and
the
haunted
predisposing
to
an
uncanny
psychosis
the
gothic
ghost
does
not
love
the
garish
day
and
the
terror
castle
gloomy
even
under
the
brightest
sun
is
of
unimaginable
darkness
at
night
certain
houses
add
especially
to
the
impression
of
fear
at
crucial
moments
the
stroke
of
twelve
or
one
is
sure
to
be
sounded
appallingly
by
some
abbey
bell
or
castle
clock
or
other
rusty
horologue
in
addition
to
its
services
as
the
bell
has
a
predisposition
to
toll
melancholy
birds
fly
freely
through
these
medieval
tales
their
dark
wings
adding
to
the
general
gloom
the
principal
specimens
in
the
gothic
aviary
are
the
common
owl
the
screech
or
screeching
owl
the
bat
and
the
raven
while
the
flock
is
increased
by
anonymous
birds
of
prey
night
birds
gloomy
birds
and
so
forth
in
as
the
murderer
steals
at
midnight
through
the
corridor
toward
his
helpless
victim
the
bird
of
night
that
sat
screeching
on
the
battlement
of
the
prison
tower
whose
harsh
discordant
notes
were
echoed
by
the
hoarse
croaking
of
the
ominous
raven
terrifies
but
does
not
deter
the
villain
the
moping
melancholy
screech
owl
is
one
of
the
prominent
personages
in
accusing
emphasizing
the
moments
of
special
suspense
as
in
as
the
wicked
baron
lies
quaking
in
remorse
for
having
caused
a
nun
to
be
buried
alive
the
condemning
cry
of
the
doleful
birds
increases
his
mental
anguish
similar
instances
with
or
without
special
nomenclature
occur
in
countless
gothic
novels
much
use
is
also
made
of
the
dark
ivy
in
its
clambering
over
medieval
architecture
shutting
out
the
light
and
adding
to
the
general
gloom
the
effect
of
horror
is
increased
frequently
by
the
location
of
the
scenes
in
vaults
and
graveyards
with
all
their
gruesome
accessories
and
skulls
are
used
as
mural
ornaments
elsewhere
or
as
library
appointments
by
persons
of
morbid
temperament
enough
skeletons
are
exhumed
to
furnish
as
large
a
pile
of
bones
as
may
be
seen
in
certain
antique
churches
in
italy
and
mexico
the
element
of
mystery
and
mystification
is
another
family
feature
of
the
novel
of
suspense
there
is
no
proper
thrill
without
the
suspense
attained
by
supernatural
mystery
even
the
novels
that
in
the
end
carefully
explain
away
all
the
ghostly
phenomena
on
a
natural
basis
strive
with
care
to
build
up
plots
which
shall
contain
astounding
discoveries
radcliffe
and
regina
maria
roche
are
noted
in
this
respect
they
have
not
the
courage
of
their
ghosts
as
such
but
after
they
have
thrilled
the
reader
to
the
desired
extent
they
tear
down
the
fabric
of
mystification
that
they
have
constructed
and
meticulously
explain
everything
the
black
veil
constitutes
a
favorite
method
of
suspense
with
radcliffe
on
various
occasions
emily
pales
and
quivers
before
a
dark
velvet
pall
uncannily
swaying
in
the
midnight
wind
and
on
one
such
ramble
she
draws
aside
the
curtain
and
finds
a
hideous
corpse
putrid
and
dropping
to
decay
lying
on
a
couch
behind

many
chapters
further
on
she
learns
that
this
is
a
wax

penance
for

again
she
shivers
in

inky
curtain
watching
its
fold
move
unaccountably
when
a
repulsive
face
peers
out
at
her
she
shrieks
and
flees
thinking
she
has
seen
a
ghost
but
discovers
later
that
it
is
one
of
a
company
of
bandits
that
have
taken
up
their
secret
abode
in
the
house
black
veils
are
in
fashion
in
all
of
radcliffe
romances
and
she
drapes
them
very
effectively
while
the
arras
waves
likewise
in
other
tales
as
well
mysterious
manuscripts
are
another
means
of
mystification
radcliffe
novels
also
abound

inexplicable
music
forms
one
of
the
commonest
elements
of
mystification
in
these
romances
its
constant
recurrence
suggests
that
there
must
have
been
victrolas
in
medieval
times
the
music
is
chiefly
instrumental
sometimes
on
a
harp
sometimes
on
a
violin
though
occasionally
it
is
vocal
radcliffe
and
regina
maria
roche
accompany
the
heroine
musings
at
all
hours
with
doleful
strains
suspected
to
be
of
supernatural
performance
the
appearance
of
the
devil
masquerading
as
the
moor
is
heralded
by
sounds
and
in
spirit
of
the
specter
plays
on

the
recurrence
of
the
theme
is
so
constant
that
it
acquires
the
monotony
of
a
tantalizing
refrain
in
groans
and
wails
of
unexplained
origin
also
aid
in
building
up
suspense
in
fact
a
chorus
of
lugubriousness
arises
so
that
the
gothic
pages
groan
as
they
are
turned
mysterious
disappearances
likewise
increase
the
tension
lights
appear
and
vanish
with
alarming
volition
doors
open
and
close
with
no
visible
human
assistance
and
various
other
supernatural
phenomena
aid
in
gothic
mystery
and
mystification
although
the
ghosts
and
devils
occupy
the
center
of
interest
in
the
horrific
romance
the
human
characters
must
not
be
lightly
passed
over
there
are
terror
temperaments
as
well
as
gothic
castles
tempests
and
scenes
the
interfering
father
or
other
relative
brutal
in
threats
and
breathing
forth
slaughter
comes
in
frequently
to
oppress
the
hero
or
heroine
into
a
loathed
marriage
the
hero
is
of
radcliffian
gloom
a
person
of
vague
past
and
saturnine
temper
admired
and
imitated
by
byron
sir
walter
raleigh
says
the
man
that
byron
tried
to
be
was
the
invention
of
mrs
radcliffe
the
officials
of
the
inquisition
and
the
dominant
figures
in
convents
and
monasteries
show
fiendish
cruelty
toward
helpless
inmates
gloating
in
gothic
diabolism
over
their
tortures
there
are
no
restful
human
shades
of
gray
only
unrelieved
black
and
white
characters
the
romantic
heroine
is
a
peculiar
creature
much
given
to
swooning
and
weeping
yet
always
impeccably
clad
in
no
matter
what
nocturnal
emergency
she
is
surprised
she
tumbles
into
verse
and
sketching
on
slight
provocation
but
her
worst
vice
is
that
of
curiosity
in
her
search
for
supernatural
horrors
she
wanders
at
midnight
through
apartments
where
she
does
not
belong
breaks
open
boxes
desks
and
secret
to
read
whatever
letters
or
manuscripts
she
can
lay
her
hands
on
behaving
generally
like
the
yellow
journalist
of
fiction
in
english
the
pages
of
the
gothic
novel
are
smeared
with
gore
and
turn
with
ghostly
flutter
the
conversation
is
like
nothing
on
land
or
sea
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
for
the
tadpoles
talk
like
johnsonian
whales
and
the
reader
grows
restless
under
godwinistic
disquisitions
the
authors
are
almost
totally
lacking
in
a
sense
of
humor
yet
the
gothic
novel
taken
as
a
whole
is
one
of
the
best
specimens
of
unconscious
humor
known
to
english
literature
perhaps
the
most
valuable
contribution
that
the
gothic
school
made
to
english
literature
is
jane
austen
inimitable
satire
of
it
though
written
as
her
first
novel
and
sold
in
it
did
not
appear
till
after
her
death
in
its
purpose
is
to
ridicule
the
romanticists
and
the
book
in
itself
would
justify
the
terroristic
school
but
she
was
ahead
of
her
times
so
the
editor
feared
to
publish
it
in
the
meantime
she
wrote
her
other
satires
on
society
and
won
immortality
for
her
work
which
might
never
have
been
begun
save
for
her
satiety
of
medieval
romances
the
title
of
the
story
itself
is
imitative
and
the
materials
are
all
present
yet
how
differently
employed
the
setting
is
a
gothic
abbey
tempered
to
modern
comfort
the
interfering
father
is
not
vicious
merely
the
pursuing
repulsive
lover
is
not
a
villain
only
a
silly
bore
the
heroine
has
no
beauty
nor
does
she
topple
into
sonnets
nor
snatch
a
pencil
to
sketch
the
scene
for
we
are
told
that
she
has
no
accomplishments
yet
she
goes
through
palpitating
adventures
mostly
modelled
on
radcliffe
incidents
she
is
hampered
in
not
being
supplied
with
a
lover
who
is
the
unrecognized
heir
to
vast
estates
since
all
the
young
men
in
the
county
are
properly
provided
with
parents
the
delicious
persiflage
in
which
jane
austen
hits
off
the
fiction
of
the
day
may
be
illustrated
by
a
bit
of
conversation
between
two
young
girls
my
dearest
catherine
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
the
morning
have
you
gone
on
with
yes
i
have
been
reading
it
ever
since
i
woke
and
i
have
got
to
the
black
veil
are
you
indeed
how
delightful
oh
i
would
not
tell
you
what
is
behind
that
black
veil
for
the
world
are
you
not
wild
to
know
oh
yes
quite
what
can
it
be
but
do
not
tell
me
i
would
not
be
told
on
any
account
i
know
it
must
be
a
skeleton
i
am
sure
it
is
laurentina
skeleton
oh
i
am
delighted
with
the
book
i
should
like
to
spend
my
whole
life
reading
it
i
assure
you
if
it
had
not
been
to
meet
you
i
would
not
have
come
away
from
it
for
the
world
dear
creature
how
much
obliged
i
am
to
you
and
when
you
have
finished
we
will
read
together
and
i
have
made
out
a
list
of
ten
or
twelve
more
of
the
same
kind
for
you
have
you
indeed
how
glad
i
am
what
are
they
all
i
will
read
you
their
names
directly
here
they
are
in
my
of
of
the
black
bell
orphan
of
the
and
these
will
last
us
some
time
yes
pretty
well
but
are
they
all
horrid
are
you
sure
they
are
all
horrid
yes
quite
sure
for
a
particular
friend
of
mine
a
miss
andrews
a
sweet
girl
one
of
the
sweetest
creatures
in
the
world
has
read
every
one
of
them
george
saintsbury
expresses
himself
as
sceptical
of
this
list
as
a
catalogue
of
actual
romances
stating
that
he
has
never
read
one
of
them
and
should
like
some
other
authority
than
miss
andrews
for
their
existence
he
is
mistaken
in
his
doubt
however
since
during
the
progress
of
this
investigation
four
out
of
the
eight
have
been
identified
as
to
authorship
and
doubtless
the
others
are
lurking
in
some
antique
library

austen
stupid
bore
john
thorpe
and
tilney
the
impeccable
pedantic
hero
add
their
comment
to
gothic
fiction
one
saying
with
a
yawn
that
there
has
been
a
decent
novel
since
except
and
the
other
that
he
read
in
two
days
with
his
hair
standing
on
end
all
the
time
but
the
real
cleverness
of
the
work
consists
in
the
burlesque
of
gothic
experiences
that
catherine
because
of
the
excited
condition
of
her
mind
induced
by
excess
of
romantic
fiction
goes
through
with
on
her
visit
to
northanger
abbey
she
explores
secret
wings
in
a
search
for
horrors
only
to
find
sunny
rooms
with
no
imprisoned
wife
not
a
single
maniac
and
never
skeleton
of
tortured
nun
tilney
ironic
jests
satirize
all
the
elements
of
gothic
romance
opening
a
black
chest
at
midnight
she
finds
a
yellowed
manuscript
but
just
as
she
is
about
to
read
it
her
candle
flickers
out
in
the
morning
sunshine
she
finds
that
it
is
an
old
laundry
list
the
only
result
of
her
suspicious
explorings
is
that
she
is
caught
in
such
prowlings
by
the
young
man
whose
esteem
she
wishes
to
win
he
sarcastically
assures
her
that
his
father
is
not
a
that
his
mother
is
not
immured
in
a
dungeon
but
died
of
a
bilious
attack
these
delicately
tipped
shafts
of
ridicule
riddle
the
armor
of
medievalism
and
give
it
at
the
same
time
a
permanency
of
interest
because
of
jane
austen
treatment
of
it
the
gothic
novel
will
be
remembered
if
for
nothing
else
for
her
parody
of
it
but
miss
austen
is
not
the
only
satirist
of
the
in
eaton
stannard
barrett
gives
an
amusing
burlesque
of
it
it
is
interesting
to
note
in
this
connection
that
while
was
written
and
sold
in
it
was
not
published
till
and

while

later
was

know
that
the
moment
that
a
mortal
manuscript
is
written
in
a
legible
hand
and
the
word
end
or
finis
attached
thereto
whatever
characters
happen
to
be
sketched
therein
acquire
the
quality
of
creating
a
soul

spirit
which
takes
flight
and
ascends
immediately
through
the
regions
of
the
air
till
it
arrives
at
the

where
it
is
embodied
and
becomes
a
living
creature
the
precise
counterpart
of
the
literary
prototype
know
farther
that
all
the
towns
villages
rivers
hills
and
valleys
of
the
moon
also
owe
their
origin
to
the
descriptions
which
writers
give
of
the
landscapes
of
the
earth
by
means
of
a
book
i
became
a
living
inhabitant
of

i
met
with
the
radclyffian
and
rochian
heroines
and
others
but
they
tossed
their
heads
and
told
me
pertly
that
i
was

to
wander
over

in

what
comic
experiences
one
may
imagine
there
is
much
discussion
of
the
gothic

those
from

style
according
to
romance
she
has
the
fat

shut
up

the
book
is
very
amusing
and
a
more
pronounced
parody
on
gothicism
than
because
the
whole
story
turns
round
that
theme
but
of
course
it
is
not
of
so
great
literary
value
it
seems
strange
however
that
it
is
so
little
known
it
burlesques
every
feature
of
terror
fiction
the
language
the
excited
oaths
the
feudal
furniture
the
medieval
architecture
the
gothic
weather
the
supernatural
tempers
the

across

the
whole

up
in

delightful
parody

ludicrous
weaknesses
and
excesses

likewise
the
parodies

satire
directed
at

peacock
novel
in
general
gothicism
had
a
tonic
effect
on
english
literature
and
influenced
the
continental
fiction
to
no
small
degree
by
giving
an
interest
and
excitement
gained
from
ghostly
themes
to
fiction
the
terror
writers
made
romance
popular
as
it
had
never
been
before
and
immensely
extended
the
range
of
its
readers
the
novel
has
never
lost
the
hold
on
popular
fancy
that
the
gothic
ghost
gave
to
it
this
interest
has
increased
through
the
various
aspects
of
romanticism
since
then
and
in
every
period
has
found
some
form
of
supernaturalism
on
which
to
feed
true
the
machinery
of
gothicism
creaks
audibly
at
times
some
of
the
specters
move
too
mechanically
and
there
is
a
general
air
of
unreality
that
detracts
from
the
effect
the
supernaturalism
often
lacks
the
naturalness
which
is
necessary
yet
it
is
not
fair
to
apply
to
these
early
efforts
the
same
standards
by
which
we
judge
the
novels
of
while
their
range
is
narrow
they
do
achieve
certain
impressive
effects
though
the
class
became
conventionalized
to
an
absurd
degree
and
the
later
examples
are
laughable
while
a
host
of
imitations
made
the
type
ridiculous
the
gothic
novel
has
an
undeniable
force
besides
the
bringing
of
supernaturalism
definitely
into
fiction
which
is
a
distinct
gain
we
find
other
benefits
as
well
in
gothicism
if
we
examine
closely
we
find
the
beginnings
of
many
forms
of
supernaturalism
that
are
crude
here
but
that
are
to
develop
into
special
power
in
later
novels
and
short
stories
the
terror
novel
excites
our
ridicule
in
some
respects
yet
like
other
things
that
arouse
a
certain
measure
of
laughter
it
has
great
value
it
seems
a
far
cry
from
the
perambulating
statue
in
to
lord
jade
gods
that
move
with
measured
stony
steps
to
wreak
a
terrible
vengeance
on
mortals
who
have
defied
them
but
the
connection
may
be
clearly
enough
seen
the
dreadful
experiments
by
which
monster
is
created
are
close
akin
to
the
revolting
vivisections
of
wells
moreau
or
the
operations
described
by
arthur
machen
whereby
human
beings
lose
their
souls
and
become
diabolized
given
over
utterly
to
unspeakable
evil
the
psychic
elements
in
are
crudely
conceived
yet
suggestive
of
the
psychic
horrors
of
the
work
of
blackwood
barry
pain
and
theodore
dreiser
for
example
the
animal
supernaturalism
only
lightly
touched
on
in
gothic
novels
is
to
be
elaborated
in
the
stories
of
ghostly
beasts
like
those
by
edith
wharton
kipling
ambrose
bierce
and
others
in
fact
the
greater
number
of
the
forms
of
the
supernatural
found
in
later
fiction
and
the
drama
are
discoverable
in
germ
at
least
in
gothic
romance
the
work
of
this
period
gave
a
tremendous
impetus
to
the
uncanny
elements
of
romanticism
and
the
effect
has
been
seen
in
the
fiction
and
drama
and
poetry
since
that
time
its
influence
on
the
drama
of
its
day
may
be
seen
in
walpole
and
lewis
thomas
lovell
beddoe
extraordinary
tragedy
jest
while
largely
elizabethan
in
materials
and
method
is
closely
related
to
the
gothic
as
well
it
would
be
impossible
to
understand
or
appreciate
the
supernatural
in
the
literature
and
that
of
our
own
day
without
a
knowledge
of
the
gothic
to
which
most
of
it
goes
back
like
most
beginnings
gothicism
is
crude
in
its
earlier
forms
and
conventional
in
the
flood
of
imitations
that
followed
the
successful
attempts
but
it
is
really
vital
and
most
of
the
ghostly
fiction
since
that
time
has
lineally
descended
from
it
rather
than
from
the
supernaturalism
of
the
epic
or
of
the
drama
chapter
ii
later
influences
the
gothic
period
marked
a
change
in
the
vehicle
of
supernaturalism
in
ancient
times
the
ghostly
had
been
expressed
in
the
epic
or
the
drama
in
medievalism
in
the
romances
metrical
and
prose
as
in
elizabethan
literature
the
drama
was
the
specific
form
but
gothicism
brought
it
over
frankly
into
the
novel
which
was
a
new
thing
that
is
noteworthy
since
supernaturalism
seems
more
closely
related
to
poetry
than
to
prose
and
as
the
early
dramas
were
for
the
most
part
poetic
it
did
not
require
such
a
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
give
credence
to
the
unearthly
the
ballad
the
epic
the
drama
had
made
the
ghostly
seem
credible
but
prose
fiction
is
so
much
more
materialistic
that
at
first
thought
supernaturalism
seems
antagonistic
to
it
that
this
is
not
really
the
case
is
evidenced
from
the
fact
that
fiction
since
the
terror
times
has
retained
the
elements
of
awe
then
introduced
has
developed
and
has
greatly
added
to
them
with
the
dying
out
of
the
definitely
known
as
the
gothic
novel
and
the
turning
of
romanticism
into
various
new
channels
we
might
expect
to
see
the
disappearance
of
the
ghostly
element
since
it
had
been
overworked
in
terrorism
it
is
true
that
the
prevailing
type
of
fiction
for
the
succeeding
period
was
realism
but
with
a
large
admixture
of
the
supernormal
or
supernatural
the
supernatural
machinery
had
become
so
well
established
in
prose
fiction
that
even
realists
were
moved
by
it
some
using
the
motifs
with
bantering
apology
even
dickens
and
thackeray
some
with
rationalistic
explanation
but
practically
all
using
it
man
must
and
will
have
the
supernatural
in
his
fiction
the
very
elements
that
one
might
suppose
would
counteract
it
modern
thought
invention
science
serve
as
feeders
to
its
force
in
the
inexplicable
alchemy
of
literature
almost
everything
turns
to
the
unearthly
in
some
form
or
other
we
have
seen
the
various
sources
from
which
the
gothic
novel
drew
its
plots
its
motifs
for
ghostly
effect
the
supernatural
fiction
following
it
still
had
the
same
sources
on
which
to
draw
and
in
addition
had
various
other
influences
and
veins
of
literary
inspiration
not
open
to
gothicism
modern
science
with
the
new
miracles
of
its
laboratories
proved
suggestive
of
countless
plots
the
new
study
of
and
the
scholarly
investigations
in
that
field
unearthed
an
unguessed
wealth
of
supernatural
material

their
patient
and
sympathetic
records
of
the
forces
of
the

hitherto
unknown
elements
continuing
the
supernatural
in
fiction
with
the
extension
of
general
reading
and
the
greater
range
of
translations
from
other
languages
the
writers
of
england
and
america
were
affected
by
new
influences
with
respect
to
their
use
of
the
supernatural
their
work
became
less
insular
wider
in
its
range
of
and
of
technical
methods
and
in
our
fiction
we
find
the
effect
of
certain
definite
outside
forces
the
overlapping
influences
of
the
romantic
movement
in
england
and
america
france
and
germany
form
an
interesting
but
intricate
study
it
is
difficult
to
point
out
marked
points
of
contact
though
the
general
effect
may
be
evident
for
literary
influences
are
usually
very
elusive
it
is
easy
to
cry
lo
here
lo
there
with
reference
to
the
effect
of
certain
writers
on
their
contemporaries
or
successors
but
it
is
not
always
easy
to
put
the
finger
on
anything
very
tangible
and
even
so
that
would
not
explain
literature
if
one
could
point
with
absolute
certainty
to
the
source
for
every
one
of
shakespeare
plots
would
that
explain
his
art
poe
wrote
an
elaborate
essay
to
analyze
his
processes
of
composition
for
but
the
poem
remains
as
enigmatic
as
ever
as
german
romanticism
had
been
considerably
affected
by
the
gothic
novel
in
england
it
in
turn
showed
an
influence
on
later
english
and
american
ghostly
fiction
scott
was
much
interested
in
the
german
literature
treating
of
evil
magic
apparitions
castles
in
ruins
and
so
forth
and
one
critic
says
of
him
that
his
dealings
with
subjects
of
this
kind
are
midway
between
meinhold
and
tieck
he
was
fascinated
with
the
german
ballads
of
the
supernatural
especially
ghostly
which
he
translated
among
others
de
quincey
likewise
was
a
student
of
german
literature
though
he
was
not
so
accurate
in
his
scholarship
as
scott
his
horror
tale
as
well
as
has
a
german
setting
and
tone
there
has
been
some
discussion
over
the
question
of
relation
to
german
romanticism
poe
made
the
charge
that
hawthorne
drew
his
ideas
and
style
from
ludwig
tieck
saying
in
a
criticism
the
fact
is
he
is
not
original
in
any
sense
those
who
speak
of
him
as
original
mean
nothing
more
than
that
he
differs
in
his
manner
or
tone
and
in
his
choice
of
subjects
from
any
author
of
their
acquaintance
their
acquaintance
not
extending
to
the
german
tieck
whose
manner
in
of
his
works
is
absolutely
identical
with
that
to
hawthorne
the
critic
unacquainted
with
tieck
who
reads
a
single
tale
by
hawthorne
may
be
justified
in
thinking
him
original
various
critics
have
discussed
this
matter
with
no
very
definite
conclusions
it
should
be
remembered
that
poe
was
a
famous
hence
his
comments
may
be
discounted
yet
poe
knew
german
it
is
thought
and
in
his
writings
often
referred
to
german
literature
while
hawthorne
according
to
his
journal
read
it
with
difficulty
and
spoke
of
his
struggles
with
a
volume
of
tieck
hawthorne
and
tieck
do
show
certain
similarities
as
in
the
use
of
the
dream
element
the
employment
of
the
allegory
as
a
medium
for
teaching
moral
truths
and
the
choice
of
the
legend
as
a
literary
form
both
use
somewhat
the
same
dreamy
supernaturalism
yet
in
style
as
in
hawthorne
is
much
the
superior
and
improved
whatever
he
may
have
borrowed
from
tieck
hawthorne
vague
mystery
cloudy
symbolism
and
deep
spiritualism
are
individual
in
their
effect
and
give
to
his
supernaturalism
an
unearthly
charm
scarcely
found
elsewhere
hawthorne
theme
in
marble
of
the
attaining
to
a
soul
by
human
suffering
is
akin
to
the
idea
in
fouqué
there
the
supernaturalism
is
franker
while
that
of
hawthorne
novel
is
more
evasive
and
delicate
yet
the
same
suggestion
is
present
in
each
case
lowell
in
his
for
speaks
of
hawthorne
as
a
john
bunyan
fouqué
a
puritan
tieck
there
are
still
more
striking
similarities
to
be
pointed
out
between
the
work
of
poe
and
that
of
hoffmann
as
hawthorne
was
to
a
slight
extent
at
least
affected
by
german
legends
and
wonder
tales
poe
was
influenced
by
hoffmann
horror
stories
poe
has
been
called
a
germanic
dreamer
and
various
german
and
english
critics
mention
the
debt
that
he
owes
to
hoffmann
palmer
cobb
brings
out
some
interesting
facts
in
connection
with
the
two
romanticists
he
says
the
verification
of
poe
indebtedness
to
german
is
to
be
sought
in
the
similarity
of
the
treatment
of
the
same
motives
in
the
work
of
both
authors
the
most
convincing
evidence
is
furnished
by
the
way
in
which
poe
has
combined
the
themes
of
mesmerism
metempsychosis
dual
existence
the
dream
element
and
so
forth
in
exact
agreement
with
the
grouping
employed
by
hoffmann
notable
examples
of
this
are
the
employment
of
the
idea
of
double
existence
in
conjunction
with
the
struggle
of
good
and
evil
forces
in
the
soul
of
the
individual
and
the
combination
of
mesmerism
and
metempsychosis
as
leading
motives
in
one
and
the
same
story
influence
of
hoffmann
on
edgar
allan
cobb
points
out
in
detail
the
similarities
between
poe
stories
of
dual
personality
and
the
german
use
of
the
theme
as
found
in
fouqué
novalis
and
hoffmann
particularly
the
last
exaggerated
use
of
this
idea
is
to
be
explained
on
the
ground
that
he
was
obsessed
by
the
thought
that
his
double
was
haunting
him
and
he
like
maupassant
under
similar
conditions
of
mind
wrote
of
supernaturalism
associated
with
madness
hoffmann
uses
the
theme
of
double
personality
in
poe
the
other
self
is
the
embodiment
of
good
a
sort
of
incarnate
conscience
as
in
markheim
while
hoffmann
represents
the
evil
poe
has
here
reversed
the
idea
in
hoffmann
we
find
the
treatment
of
hypnotism
and
metempsychosis
and
the
in
the
same
combination
that
poe
uses
hoffmann
and
poe
relate
the
story
of
a
supernatural
portrait
where
the
dies
as
the
sacrifice
to
the
painting
in
the
and
des
in
his
of
the
ragged
in
in
in
oval
both
hoffmann
and
poe
use
the
grotesquerie
of
supernaturalism
the
fantastic
element
of
horror
that
adds
to
the
effect
of
the
ghostly
even
the
generic
titles
are
almost
identical
but
in
spite
of
these
similarities
in
theme
and
in
grouping
there
is
no
basis
for
a
charge
that
poe
owes
a
stylistic
debt
to
hoffmann
in
his
manner
he
is
original
and
individual
he
uses
his
themes
with
much
greater
art
with
more
dramatic
and
powerful
effect
than
his
german
contemporary
though
he
employs
fewer
of
the
crude
machineries
of
the
supernatural
his
ghostly
tales
are
more
unearthly
than
hoffmann
his
horrors
have
a
more
awful
effect
because
he
is
an
incomparably
greater
artist
he
knows
the
economy
of
thrills
as
few
have
done
his
is
the
genius
of
compression
of
suggestion
his
dream
elements
for
instance
though
hoffmann
uses
the
dream
to
as
great
extent
as
poe
are
more
poignant
more
unbearable
compare
poe

of
his
type
as

cult
of
horror
in
german
literature
as
evidenced
in
the
work
of
hoffmann
kleist
tieck
arnim
fouqué
chamisso
had
an
influence
on
english
and
american
literature
of

the

which
theme
appears
to
have

literary
elixir
of
life
are
reflected
to
a
certain
degree
in
the
english
ghostly
tales
of
the
generation
following
the
gothic
romance
a
french
influence
is
likewise
manifest
in
the
later
english
fiction
the
gothic
novel
had
made
itself
felt
in
france
as
well
as
in
germany
a
proof
of
which
is
the
fact
that
balzac
was
so
impressed
by
maturin
novel
that
he
wrote
a
sequel
to
it
the
interrelations
of
the
english
french
and
german
supernatural
literature
are
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
the
work
of
balzac
he
admits
hoffmann
inspiration
of
his
of
that
horrible
story
of
reanimation
where
the
head
is
restored
to
life
and
youth
but
the
body
remains
that
of
an
old
man
dead
and
decaying
from
which
the
head
tears
itself
loose
in
the
church
and
bites
the
abbot
to
the
brain
shrieking
out
idiot
tell

now

is
seen
in
such
stories
as
haunters
and
the
the
house
and
the
and
strange
in
each
of
which
the
theme
of
supernaturally
continued
life
is
used
balzac
is
a
symbolic
story
of
supernaturalism
that
suggests
hawthorne
allegoric
symbolism
and
may
have
influenced
it
in
part
it
is
a
new
application
of
the
old
theme
used
often
in
the
drama
as
in
gothic
romance
of
the
pledge
of
a
soul
for
earthly
gratification
a
magic
skin
gives
the
man
his
heart
desires
yet
each
granted
wish
makes
the
talisman
shrink
perceptibly
with
an
inexorable
decrease
this
theme
symbolic
of
the
truth
of
life
is
such
a
spiritual
idea
used
allegorically
as
hawthorne
chose
frequently
and
doubtless
influenced
oscar
wilde
of
dorian
is
another
example
of
his
supernaturalism
that
has
had
its
suggestive
effect
on
english
ghostly
fictions
guy
de
maupassant
has
doubtless
influenced
english
tales
of
horror
more
than
any
foreign
writer
since
hoffmann
as
a
stylist
he
exercised
a
definite
and
strong
influence
over
the
form
condensing
it
making
it
more
economical
more
like
a
fatal
bullet
that
goes
straight
to
the
mark
and
putting
into
a
few
hundred
words
a
story
of
supernatural
horror
relentless
in
its
effect
delicately
perfect
ghost
story
furnished
is
reminiscent
of
maupassant
technique
as
seen
in
and
surely
marion
crawford
and
ambrose
bierce
toe
of
the
right
are
from
the
same
body
as
maupassant
what
a
terrible
corpus
it
must
be
there
is
the
same
gruesome
mystery
the
same
implacable
horror
in
each
story
of
a
mutilated
ghost
maupassant
stories
of
madness
akin
to
poe
analyses
of
mental
decay
of
the
slow
corruption
of
the
brain
are
among
his
most
dreadful
triumphs
of
style
and
have
influenced
various
english
stories
of
insanity
in
maupassant
own
tottering
reason
we
find
the
tragic
explanation
of
his
constant
return
to
this
type
of
story
such
tales
as
where
a
husband
goes
insane
from
doubt
of
his
wife
where
a
man
has
a
weird
power
over
human
beings
animals
and
even
inanimate
objects
making
them
do
his
will
so
that
he
is
terrified
of
his
own
self
of
what
his
horrible
hands
may
do
mechanically
where
the
drowned
dog
following
its
master
a
hundred
miles
down
the
river
drives
him
insane
a
curdling
story
of
the
relation
between
insanity
and
the
supernatural
so
that
one
is
unable
to
say
which
is
cause
and
which
effect
illustrate
maupassant
unusual
association
between
madness
and
uncanny
fiction
who
but
maupassant
could
make
a
story
of
ghastly
hideousness
out
of
a
parrot
that
swears
as
maupassant
was
influenced
by
poe
in
both
subject
matter
and
technique
so
he
has
affected
the
english
writers
since
his
time
in
both
plot
material
and
treatment
of
the
supernatural
and
as
his
strongly
reflects
fitzjames
was
it
a
that
anticipated
it
by
a
number
of
years
so
it
left
its
inevitable
impress
on
bierce
damned
and
succeeding
stories
of
supernatural
invisibility
a
recent
story
by
katherine
fullerton
gerould
third
seems
clearly
to
indicate
the
de
maupassant
influence
reflecting
the
method
and
motifs
of
and
maupassant
tales
have
a
peculiar
horror
possessed
by
few
partly
because
of
his
undoubted
genius
and
partly
the
result
of
his
increasing
madness
other
french
writers
have
also
influenced
the
uncanny
story
in
english
théophile
gautier
has
undoubtedly
inspired
various
tales
such
as
mummy
by
jessie
adelaide
weston
which
is
the
match
though
not
in
beauty
or
form
to
his
little
masterpiece
of
that
title
conan
doyle
no
a
horrible
story
of
a
reanimated
mummy
bears
an
unquestionable
resemblance
to
gautier

that
they

wake
to
life
after
thousands
of
years
preceded
it
something
of
the

theme
is
also
used
by
marion
crawford
where

fiction
gautier
morte
has
exercised
suggestive
power
over
later
tales
such
as
crawford
vampire
story
though
it
is
significant
to
recall
that
poe
preceded
gautier
story
by
a
year
and
the
latter
must
have
known
poe
work
in
the
blood
is
the
the
fiction
of
appears
to
have
suggested
various
english
stories
owl
obviously
inspired
another
both
being
records
of
supernatural
acoustics
the
latter
dealing
with
spiritual
sounds
invisible
a
fearsome
story
of
hypnotism
has
an
evident
parental
claim
on
algernon
blackwood
story
though
the
latter
is
psychically
more
gruesome
waters
of
an
account
of
a
loathsome
enchanted
crab
suggests
wells
story
of
the
plant
vampire
spider
by
lucretia
hale
intent
to
flowering
of
the
strange
likewise
anatole
france
the
narrative
of
the
man
who
came
to
have
an
actual
existence
because
someone
spoke
of
him
as
an
imaginary
person
is
associated
with
the
drolleries
of
supernaturalism
such
as
are
used
by
thomas
bailey
aldrich
in
the
story
of
an
imagined
person
mehitabel
and
by
frank
r
stockton
anatole
france
has
several
delicately
wrought
idylls
of
the
supernatural
as
mass
of
where
the
ghosts
of
those
who
have
sinned
for
love
may
meet
once
a
year
to
be
reunited
with
their
loved
ones
and
in
the
church
with
clasped
hands
celebrate
the
spectral
mass
or
such
tender
miracles
as
juggler
of
notre
where
the
juggler
throws
his
balls
before
the
altar
as
an
act
of
worship
and
is
rewarded
by
a
sight
of
the
virgin
or
a
symbolic
story
much
like
one
written
years
earlier
by
thomas
bailey
aldrich
where
a
plant
miraculously
springs
from
the
heart
of
a
dead
woman
and
the
story
of
the
faun
and
the
hermit
of
whom
he
tells
us
that
the
hermit
is
a
faun
borne
down
by
the
years
is
suggestive
of
the
wonderful
little
stories
of
lord
dunsany
lord
dunsany
while
startlingly
original
in
most
respects
seems
a
bit
influenced
by
anatole
france
his
the
gods
seems
reminiscent
of
isle
of
the
in
france
satire
the
gods
change
penguins
into
men
whose
souls
will
be
lost
because
the
priest
has
baptized
them
by
mistake
while
in
dunsany
story
the
baboons
pray
to
the
yogis
who
promise
to
make
them
men
in
return
for
their
devotion
and
the
baboons
arose
from
worshipping
smoother
about
the
face
and
a
little
shorter
in
the
arms
and
went
away
and
hid
themselves
in
clothing
and
herded
with
men
and
men
could
not
discern
what
they
were
for
their
bodies
were
bodies
of
men
though
their
souls
were
still
the
souls
of
beasts
and
the
worship
went
to
the
yogis
spirits
of
in
transferred
and
spectral
antoine
date
maeterlinck
influenced
by
his
charles
van
lerberghe
whose
appeared
before
maeterlinck
plays
of
the
uncanny
and
to
whom
he
acknowledges
his
indebtedness
has
strongly
affected
ghostly
literature
since
his
rise
to
recognition
in
his
plays
we
find
an
atmospheric
supernaturalism
the
settings
are
of
earth
yet
with
an
unearthly
strangeness
with
no
impression
of
realism
of
the
familiar
the
known
in
maeterlinck
plays
we
never
breathe
the
air
of
actuality
never
feel
the
footing
of
solid
earth
as
we
always
do
in
shakespeare
even
in
the
presence
of
ghosts
or
witches
visitants
are
ghostly
enough
certainly
but
the
scenes
in
which
they
appear
are
real
are
normal
while
in
the
belgian
work
there
is
a
fluidic
supernaturalism
that
transforms
everything
to
unreality
we
feel
the
grip
of
fate
as
in
the
ancient
greek
tragedies
the
inescapable
calamity
that
approaches
with
swift
silent
pace
yet
maeterlinck
is
essentially
static
drama
there
is
very
little
action
among
the
human
beings
at
least
for
fate
is
the
active
agent
in
and
the
elements
are
much
the
same
the
effects
wrought
out
with
the
same
unearthly
manner
but
in
which
shows
a
certain
similarity
to
and
we
have
a
different
type
of
supernaturalism
the
use
of
enchantment
of
fairy
magic
that
comes
to
a
close
happily
in
the
there
is
a
mixture
of
realism
and
poetic
symbolism
the
use
of
the
dream
as
a
vehicle
for
the
supernormal
and
many
aspects
of
the
weird
combined
in
a
fairy
play
of
exquisite
symbolism
blue
the
influence
of
maeterlinck
is
apparent
in
the
work
of
english
writers
particularly
of
the
celtic
school
yeats
fairy
play
land
of
heart
with
its
pathetic
beauty
his
tragedy
of
the
countess
who
sells
her
soul
to
the
devil
that
her
people
may
be
freed
from
his
power
as
well
as
his
stories
show
the
traces
of
maeterlinck
methods
william
sharp
in
his
sketches
and
his
brief
plays
in
the
volume
called
reflects
the
belgian
technique
slightly
though
with
his
own
individual
power
sharp
other
literary
self
fiona
mcleod
likewise
shows
his
influence
as
does
synge
in
his
to
the
and
gordon
bottomley
in
his
by
that
eerie
tragedy
of
an
unseen
power
maeterlinck
supernaturalism
seems
to
suggest
the
poetry
of
coleridge
with
its
elusive
intangible
ghostliness
the
effect
of
naïveté
observable
in
coleridge
work
is
in
maeterlinck
produced
by
a
simplicity
of
style
a
monosyllabic
dialogue
and
a
monotonous
unreasoning
repetition
that
is
at
once
real
and
unreal
the
dramatist
has
brought
over
from
the
poet
the
same
suggestive
use
of
portents
and
symbols
for
prefiguring
death
or
disaster
that
lurks
just
outside
the
ghostliness
is
subtle
rather
than
evident
the
drama
static
rather
than
dynamic
ibsen
also
has
strongly
influenced
the
supernatural
in
both
our
drama
and
our
fiction
his
own
work
has
a
certain
kinship
with
that
of
hawthorne
showing
a
like
symbolism
and
mysticism
a
like
transfusion
of
the
unreal
with
the
natural
so
that
one
scarcely
knows
just
how
far
he
means
our
acceptance
of
the
unearthly
to
extend
he
leaves
it
in
some
cases
an
open
question
while
in
others
he
frankly
introduces
the
supernatural
the
child
vision
of
the
dead
heroes
riding
to
valhalla
with
his
own
mother
who
has
killed
herself
leading
them
the
ghost
that
tries
to
make
an
unholy
pact
with
the
king
the
apparition
and
the
supernatural
voice
crying
out
he
is
the
god
of
love
illustrate
ibsen
earlier
methods
the
curious
almost
inexplicable
with
its
mixture
of
and
symbolism
its
ironic
laughter
and
satiric
seriousness
seems
to
have
had
a
suggestive
influence
on
other
works
such
as
where
the
personification
of
temptation
in
the
form
of
committed
sin
reflects
ibsen
idea
of
peer
gynt
imaginary
children
the
uncanny
power
of
unspoken
thought
the
haunting
force
of
ideas
rather
than
the
crude
visible
phantasms
of
the
dead
as
in
the
telepathy
or
hypnotism
or
what
you
will
in
master
the
evasive
intangible
haunting
of
the
living
by
the
dead
as
in
the
strange
powers
at
work
as
in
lady
from
the
have
had
effect
on
the
numerous
psychic
dramas
and
stories
in
english
the
symbolic
mysticism
in
and
showing
the
spirits
of
cain
and
of
judas
with
their
sad
ignorance
of
life
riddles
the
vision
of
christ
in
person
with
his
unceasing
power
over
men
souls
foreshadowed
the
plays
and
stories
bringing
in
the
personality
of
christ
as
servant
in
the
and
passing
of
the
third
floor
in
vikings
of
in
in
by
shorthouse
modern
italian
literature
as
represented
by
fogazzaro
and
introduces
the
ghostly
in
fiction
and
in
the
drama
and
has
had
its
effect
on
our
literature
fogazzaro
novels
are
essentially
realistic
in
pattern
yet
he
uses
the
supernatural
in
them
as
in
miraculous
visions
and
metempsychosis
and
madness
associated
with
the
supernatural
handling
of
the
unearthly
is
more
repulsive
more
psychically
gruesome
as
the
malignant
power
of
the
ancient
curse
in
città
where
the
undying
evil
in
an
old
tomb
causes
such
revolting
horror
in
the
action
of
the
play
this
has
a
counterpart
in
a
story
by
josephine
daskam
bacon
where
a
packet
of
letters
from
two
evil
lovers
lie
buried
in
a
hearth
and
by
their
subtle
influence
corrupt
the
soul
of
every
woman
who
occupies
the
room
uses
the
witch
motive
powerfully
madness
that
borders
on
the
supernatural
and
the
idea
of
evil
magic
exorcised
by
melting
an
image
of
wax
to
cause
an
enemy
death
which
suggests
rossetti
poem
using
that
incident
the
unforgettable
in
and
in
in
daughter
of
in
mattino
di
in
tramonto
likewise
a
new
force
in
the
work
of
the
russian
school
has
affected
our
fiction
of
the
ghostly
in
recent
years
russian
literature
is
a
new
field
of
thought
for
english
people
since
it
is
only
of
late
years
that
translations
have
been
easily
accessible
and
because
of
the
extreme
difficulty
of
the
language
very
few
outsiders
read
russian
as
german
romanticism
began
to
have
its
definite
power
over
english
supernatural
fiction
in
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
by
the
extension
of
interest
in
and
study
of
german
literature
and
the
more
frequent
translation
of
german
works
so
in
this
generation
russian
literature
has
been
introduced
to
english
people
and
is
having
its
influence
a
primitive
still
savage
race
like
the
russians
naturally
shows
a
special
fondness
for
the
supernatural
despite
the
fact
that
literature
is
written
for
the
higher
classes
a
large
peasant
body
illiterate
and
superstitious
will
influence
the
national
fiction
in
the
russian
works
best
known
to
us
there
is
a
large
element
of
the
uncanny
of
a
type
in
some
respects
different
from
that
of
any
other
country
like
the
russian
national
character
it
is
harsh
brutal
violent
yet
sentimental
one
singular
thing
to
be
noted
about
it
is
the
peculiar
combination
of
supernaturalism
with
absolute
realism
the
revolting
yet
dreadfully
effective
realism
of
the
russian
literature
is
never
more
impressive
than
in
its
union
with
ghostly
horror
which
makes
the
impossible
appear
indubitable
in
gogol
for
instance
the
fidelity
to
homely
details
of
life
the
descriptions
of
pinching
poverty
of
tragic
hopes
that
waited
so
long
for
fulfillment
are
painful
in
themselves
and
give
verisimilitude
to
the
element
of
the
unearthly
that
follows
you
feel
that
a
poor
russian
clerk
who
had
stinted
himself
from
necessity
all
his
life
come
back
from
the
dead
to
claim
his
stolen
property
and
demand
redress
the
supernatural
gains
a
new
power
a
more
tremendous
thrill
when
set
off
against
the
of
sordid
life
we
find
something
of
the
same
effect
in
the
stories
of
algernon
blackwood
and
ambrose
bierce
and
marion
crawford
tolstoi
symbolic
story
of
the
is
an
impressive
utterance
of
his
views
of
life
expressed
by
the
allegory
of
man
folly
and
wisdom
and
the
schemes
of
devils
turgeniev
pronounced
strain
of
the
unearthly
has
had
its
influence
on
english
fiction
he
uses
the
dream
elements
to
a
marked
degree
as
in
song
of
love
a
story
of
oriental
magic
employed
through
dreams
and
music
and
an
account
of
a
revelatory
visions
of
his
unknown
father
the
dream
element
has
been
used
considerably
in
our
late
fiction
some
of
which
seems
to
reflect
turgeniev
another
motive
that
he
uses
effectively
is
that
of
suggested
vampirism
and
of
psychical
vampirism
where
a
young
man
is
set
upon
by
the
spirit
of
a
dead
woman
he
has
scarcely
known
till
he
dies
under
the
torment
this
seems
to
have
affected
such
stories
as
that
of
psychical
vampirism
in
by
reginald
hodder
we
find
in
much
of
turgeniev
prose
the
symbolic
mystical
supernaturalism
besides
his
use
of
dreams
visions
and
a
distinct
oriental
element
in
knock
knock
the
treatment
of
whose
spiritualism
reminds
one
somewhat
of
browning
in
its
initial
skepticism
and
later
hesitation
the
final
effect
of
which
is
to
impress
one
with
a
sense
of
supernaturalism
working
extraordinarily
through
natural
means
so
that
it
is
more
powerful
than
the
mere
conventional
ghostly
could
be
we
see
what
may
have
been
the
inspiration
for
certain
spiritualistic
novels
and
stories
in
english
the
same
tone
is
felt
in
hamlin
garland
treatment
of
the
subject
for
instance
the
mystical
romanticism
of
turgeniev
is
less
brutally
russian
than
that
of
most
of
his
compeers
as
in
as
in
in
the
like
maupassant
and
hoffman
and
poe
the
russian
writers
use
to
a
considerable
extent
the
association
between
insanity
and
the
supernatural
to
heighten
the
effect
of
both
they
may
have
been
influenced
in
this
by
poe
studies
of
madness
as
by
maupassant
and
they
appear
to
have
an
influence
over
certain
writers
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
stronger
influence
in
the
treatment
of
abnormal
persons
maupassant
or
the
russian
writers
one
wonders
what
type
of
mania
obsesses
certain
of
the
russian
fictionists
of
for
surely
they
can
not
be
normal
persons
examples
of
such
fiction
are
alexander
pushkin
story
of
mocking
madness
resulting
from
a
passion
for
cards
whose
ghostly
motif
has
a
sardonic
diabolism
tchekhoff
story
of
abnormal
horror
a
racking
account
of
insanity
and
black
a
weird
story
of
insanity
brought
on
by
the
vision
of
a
supernatural
being
a
replicated
mirage
of
a
black
monk
a
thousand
years
old
but
it
is
in
the
work
of
leonidas
andreyev
that
we
get
the
ultimate
anguish
of
madness
red
an
analysis
of
the
madness
of
war
of
the
insanity
of
nations
as
of
individuals
seems
to
envelop
the
world
in
a
sheet
of
flame
its
horrors
go
beyond
words
and
the
brain
reels
in
reading
there
are
in
english
a
number
of
stories
of
insanity
associated
with
the
supernatural
which
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
russian
method
though
ambrose
bierce
studies
in
the
abnormality
of
soldier
life
preceded
andreyev
by
years
marion
crawford
dead
and
various
stories
of
arthur
machen
have
a
russian
horror
and
other
instances
might
be
mentioned
queen
of
no
the
russian
fiction
with
its
impersonality
of
pessimism
its
racial
gloom
its
terrible
sordid
realism
forming
a
basis
for
awesome
supernaturalism
is
of
a
type
foreign
to
our
thought
yet
as
is
not
infrequently
the
case
the
radically
different
has
a
strange
appeal
and
the
effect
of
it
on
our
stories
of
horror
is
undoubted
english
and
american
readers
are
greatly
interested
in
russian
literature
just
now
and
find
a
peculiar
relish
in
its
terrors
though
the
harsher
elements
are
somewhat
softened
in
transference
to
our
language
other
fields
of
thought
have
been
opened
to
us
within
this
generation
by
the
widening
of
our
knowledge
of
the
literature
of
other
european
countries
books
are
much
more
freely
translated
now
than
formerly
and
no
person
need
be
ignorant
of
the
fiction
of
other
lands
from
the
spanish
the
portuguese
the
chinese
japanese
and
other
tongues
we
are
receiving
stories
of
supernaturalism
that
give
us
new
ideas
new
points
of
view
the
greater
ease
of
travel
the
opportunity
to
study
lands
and
literatures
have
been
reflected
in
our
fiction
some
one
should
write
a
monograph
on
the
literary
influence
of
cook
tours
our
later
work
has
a
strong
touch
of
the
oriental
not
an
entirely
new
thing
since
we
find
it
in
beckford
and
the
tales
of
john
hawkesworth
but
more
noticeable
now
examples
are
stevenson
arabian
and
others
marion
crawford
and
stories
of
elementals
george
meredith
fantasy
shaving
of
though
many
others
might
be
named
the
oriental
fiction
permits
the
use
of
magic
sorcery
and
various
elements
that
seem
out
of
place
in
ordinary
fiction
the
popularity
of
kipling
tales
of
indian
native
life
and
character
illustrates
our
fondness
for
this
aspect
of
supernaturalism
apart
from
the
foreign
influences
that
affect
it
we
notice
a
certain
change
in
the
materials
and
methods
of
ghostly
fiction
in
english
new
elements
had
entered
into
gothic
tales
as
an
advance
over
the
earlier
forms
yet
conventions
had
grown
up
so
that
even
such
evasive
and
elusive
personalities
as
ghosts
were
hidebound
by
precedent
while
the
decline
of
the
definitely
known
as
the
gothic
novel
in
no
sense
put
an
end
to
the
supernatural
in
english
fiction
it
did
mark
a
difference
in
manner
the
gothic
ghosts
were
more
elementary
in
their
nature
more
superficial
than
those
of
later
times
life
was
in
the
days
of
walpole
and
radcliffe
more
local
because
of
the
limitations
of
travel
and
communication
it
being
considered
astounding
in
gothic
times
that
a
ghost
could
travel
a
thousand
miles
with
ease
while
mortals
moved
scientific
investigation
was
crude
compared
with
the
present
and
had
not
greatly
touched
fiction
scientific
investigations
were
as
unknown
as
societies
of
psychical
research
hence
neither
had
aided
in
the
writing
of
ghostly
fiction
the
mass
of
ghostly
stuff
which
has
appeared
in
english
since
the
gothic
period
and
which
will
be
classified
and
discussed
under
different
motifs
in
succeeding
chapters
shows
many
of
the
same
characteristics
of
the
earlier
yet
exhibits
also
a
decided
development
over
primitive
classical
and
gothic
forms
the
modern
supernaturalism
is
more
complex
more
psychological
than
the
terroristic
perhaps
because
nowadays
man
is
more
intellectual
his
more
subtle
humanity
still
wants
ghosts
as
ever
but
they
must
be
more
cleverly
presented
to
be
convincing
the
ghostly
thrill
is
as
ardently
desired
by
the
reading
public
as
eagerly
striven
for
by
the
writers
as
ever
though
it
is
more
difficult
of
achievement
now
than
formerly
yet
when
it
is
attained
it
is
more
poignant
and
lasting
in
its
effects
because
more
subtle
in
its
art
the
apparition
that
eludes
analysis
haunts
the
memory
more
than
do
the
comparatively
simple
forms
of
the
past
compare
for
instance
the
spirits
evoked
by
henry
james
and
katherine
fullerton
gerould
with
the
crude
of
cloistered
spooks
and
armored
knights
of
gothic
times
how
cheap
and
melodramatic
the
earlier
attempts
seem
the
ghost
is
at
once
less
terrible
and
more
terrible
than
those
of
the
past
there
is
not
so
much
a
sense
of
physical
fear
now
as
of
psychic
horror
the
pallid
specters
that
glide
through
antique
castles
are
ineffectual
compared
with
the
maleficent
psychic
invasions
of
modernity
on
the
other
hand
the
recent
ghostly
story
frequently
shows
a
strong
sense
of
humor
unknown
in
gothicism
and
only
suggested
in
earlier
forms
as
in
the
elder
pliny
statement
that
ghosts
would
not
visit
a
person
afflicted
with
freckles
which
shows
at
least
a
germinal
joviality
in
classical
spooks
one
feature
that
distinguishes
the
uncanny
tales
of
from
the
gothic
is
their
greater
range
of
material
the
early
terror
story
had
its
source
in
popular
superstition
classical
literature
medieval
legends
or
the
elizabethan
drama
while
in
the
century
that
has
elapsed
since
the
decay
of
the
gothic
novel
as
such
new
fields
of
thought
have
been
opened
up
and
new
sources
for
ghostly
plots
have
been
discovered
which
the
writers
of
modern
stories
are
quick
to
utilize
science
with
its
wonderful
development
has
provided
countless
plots
for
supernatural
stories
comparative
study
of
with
the
activities
of
the
numerous
associations
has
brought
to
light
fascinating
material
modern
spiritualism
with
its
seances
its
mediumistic
experiments
has
inspired
many
novels
and
stories
the
psychical
research
society
with
branches
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
its
earnest
advocates
and
serious
investigations
has
collected
suggestive
stuff
for
many
ghostly
stories
the
different
sources
for
plot
material
and
mechanics
for
awesome
effect
added
to
these
from
which
the
terror
novel
drew
its
inspiration
have
incalculably
enriched
the
supernatural
fiction
and
widened
the
limits
far
beyond
the
restrictions
of
the
conventionalized
gothic
science
has
furnished
themes
for
many
modern
stories
of
the
supernatural
modern
science
itself
under
normal
conditions
seems
like
necromancer
magic
so
its
incursion
into
thrilling
fiction
is
but
natural
every
aspect
of
research
and
discovery
has
had
its
exponent
in
fictive
form
and
the
skill
with
which
the
material
is
handled
constitutes
one
point
of
difference
between
the
present
ghostly
stories
and
the
crude
scientific
supernaturalism
of
the
early
novels
the
influence
of
darwin
spencer
huxley
and
other
scientists
of
the
last
century
did
much
to
quicken
fiction
as
well
as
thought
and
the
effects
can
be
traced
in
the
work
of
various
authors
the
widespread
interest
in
in
recent
years
has
had
an
appreciable
influence
on
the
stories
of
the
supernatural
while
the
methods
of
investigation
followed
by
the
serious
students
of
are
scientific
and
the
results
are
tabulated
in
an
analytic
rather
than
a
literary
style
yet
the
effect
is
helpful
to
fiction
comparative
studies
in
by
the
bringing
together
of
a
mass
of
material
from
diverse
sources
establishes
the
fact
of
the
universal
acceptance
of
supernaturalism
in
some
form
ethnic
superstitions
vary
yet
there
is
enough
similarity
between
the
ideas
held
by
tribes
and
races
so
widely
separated
as
to
discredit
any
basis
of
imitation
or
conscious
influence
between
them
to
be
of
great
interest
to
scientists
no
tribe
however
low
in
the
social
scale
has
been
found
that
has
no
belief
in
powers
beyond
the
mortal
associations
are
multiplying
and
the
students
of
literature
and
anthropology
are
joining
forces
in
the
effort
to
discover
and
classify
the
variant
superstitions
and
legends
of
the
past
and
of
the
races
and
tribes
still
in
their
childhood
such
activities
are
bringing
to
light
a
fascinating
wealth
of
material
from
which
the
writers
of
ghostly
tales
may
find
countless
plots
such
studies
show
how
close
akin
the
world
is
after
all
a
large
number
of
books
relating
stories
of
brownies
bogles
fairies
banshees
wraiths
hobgoblins
witches
vampires
ghouls
and
other
superhuman
personages
have
appeared
i
am
not
including
in
this
list
the
fairy
stories
that
are
written
for
juvenile
consumption
but
merely
the
or
literary
versions
for
adults
the
most
marked
instance
of
the
influence
of
in
supplying
subject
matter
for
literature
is
shown
in
the
recent
celtic
revival
the
supernatural
elements
in
the
of
ireland
scotland
and
wales
have
been
widely
used
in
fiction
poetry
and
the
drama
in
this
connection
one
is
reminded
of
collins
on
the
popular
superstitions
of
the
highlands
considered
as
the
subject
for
the
irish
national
school
with
yeats
john
synge
and
lady
gregory
as
leaders
have
made
the
of

live
in

and
the
ghostly
thrill
of
the
old

comes
down
to
us
undiminished
lord
dunsany

is
particularly
brilliant
going
back
to
ancient
times
and
the
mythologic

for
us
making
us
friendly
with
the

the

the

other

kipling
has
made
the

of
the

as
joel

immortalized
the

of

calls
back
the
ghosts
of
spanish
conquerors
and
aztec
men
and
women
repeopling
the
ancient
streets
with
courtly
specters
the
fondness
for
fiction
is
one
of
the
marked
aspects
of
romanticism
at
the
present
time
the
activities
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
have
had
decided
effect
in
stimulating
ghostly
stories
when
so
many
intelligent
persons
turn
their
attention
to
finding
and
classifying
supernatural
phenomena
the
currents
of
thought
thus
set
up
will
naturally
influence
fiction
nowadays
every
interest
known
to
man
is
reflected
in
literature
the
proceedings
of
the
association
have
been
so
widely
advertised
and
so
open
to
the
public
that
persons
who
would
not
otherwise
give
thought
to
the
supernatural
have
considered
the
matter
such
thinkers
as
stead
and
sir
oliver
lodge
to
mention
only
two
would
inevitably
influence
others
in
this
connection
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
recent
claims
by
stead
daughter
that
her
father
has
communicated
with
the
living
and
lodge
book
just
published
or
life
and
that
gives
proof
of
what
he
considers
incontrovertible
messages
from
his
son
killed
in
battle
the
collection
of
thousands
of
affirmative
answers
to
the
question
as
to
whether
one
had
ever
felt
a
ghostly
presence
not
to
be
explained
on
natural
grounds
brought
out
a
mass
of
material
that
might
serve
for
haunted
houses
have
been
catalogued
and
the
census
of
specters
taken
the
investigations
in
modern
spiritualism
have
done
much
to
affect
ghostly
literature
the
terrors
of
the
later
apparitions
are
not
physical
but
psychical
and
probably
the
stories
of
the
future
will
be
more
and
more
allied
to
spiritualism
hamlin
garland
john
corbin
william
dean
howells
algernon
blackwood
arnold
bennett
and
others
have
written
novels
and
stories
of
this
material
though
scarcely
the
fringe
of
the
garment
of
possibilities
has
yet
been
touched
if
one
but
grant
the
hypothesis
of
spiritualism
what
vistas
open
up
for
the
novelist
what
thrilling
complications
might
come
from
the
skillful
manipulation
of
astrals
alone
as
aids
in
establishing
alibis
for
instance
even
the
limitations
that
at
present
bind
ghost
stories
would
be
abolished
and
the
effects
of
the
dramatic
employment
of
spiritualistic
faith
would
be
highly
sensational
if
the
will
be
all
powerful
then
not
only
tables
but
mountains
may
be
moved
the
laws
of
physics
would
be
as
nothing
in
the
presence
of
such
powers
a
lovelorn
youth
bent
on
attaining
the
object
of
his
desires
could
by
merely
willing
it
so
sink
ocean
liners
demolish
skyscrapers
call
up
tempests
and
rival
german
secret
agents
in
his
havoc
intensely
dramatic
psychological
material
might
be
produced
by
the
conflict
resulting
from
the
double
or
multiple
personalities
in
one
own
nature
according
to
spiritualistic
ideas
there
might
be
complicated
crossings
in
love
wherein
one
would
be
jealous
of
his
alter
ego
and
conflicting
ambitions
of
exciting
character
the
struggle
necessary
for
the
model
story
might
be
intensely
dramatic
though
altogether
internal
between
one
own
selves
one
finds
himself
so
much
more
interesting
in
the
light
of
such
research
than
one
has
ever
dreamed
the
distinctions
between
materializations
and
astralizations
etherealizations
and
plain
apparitions
might
furnish
good
plot
structure
the
personality
of
the
sensitives
alone
would
be
fascinating
material
and
the
cosmic
clashes
of
will
possible
under
these
conceived
conditions
suggest
thrilling
stories
dreams
constitute
another
definite
source
for
ghostly
plots
in
modern
literature
while
this
was
true
to
a
certain
extent
in
the
gothic
novel
it
is
still
more
so
in
later
fiction
lafcadio
hearn
advances
the
theory
that
all
the
best
plots
for
ghost
stories
in
any
language
come
from
dreams
he
advises
the
person
who
would
write
supernatural
thrillers
to
study
the
phases
of
his
own
dream
life
it
would
appear
that
all
one
needs
to
do
is
to
look
into
his
own
nightmares
and
write
hearn
says
all
the
great
effects
produced
by
poets
and
story
writers
and
even
by
religious
teachers
in
the
treatment
of
the
supernatural
fear
or
mystery
have
been
obtained
directly
or
indirectly
from
dreams
though
one
may
not
literally
accept
the
whole
of
that
statement
one
must
feel
that
the
relation
between
dreams
and
supernatural
impressions
is
strikingly
close
the
feeling
of
supernatural
presence
comes
almost
always
at
night
when
one
is
or
has
been
asleep
the
guilty
man
awaking
from
sleep
thinks
that
he
sees
the
specters
of
those
he
has
wronged
because
his
dreams
have
embodied
them
for
him
the
lover
beholds
the
spirit
of
his
dead
love
because
in
dreams
his
soul
has
gone
in
search
of
her
very
young
children
are
unable
to
distinguish
between
dreams
and
reality
as
is
the
case
of
savages
of
a
low
order
believing
in
the
actuality
of
what
they
experience
in
dreams
and
who
can
say
that
our
dream
life
is
altogether
baseless
and
unreal
in
his
of
the
different
nightmare
sensations
acute
and
vivid
as
they
are
can
be
analyzed
to
find
parallelisms
between
them
and
the
ghostly
plots
for
example
take
the
sensation
common
in
nightmares
of
feeling
yourself
falling
from
immeasurable
height
the
same
thrill
of
suspense
is
communicated
by
the
climax
in
lewis
and
dacre
gothic
novels
where
the
devil
takes
guilty
mortals
to
the
mountain
top
and
hurls
them
down
down
the
horrible
potentialities
of
shadows
suggested
frequently
in
dreams
is
illustrated
by
mary
wilkins
freeman
story
where
the
accusing
spirit
comes
back
as
a
haunting
shadow
on
the
wall
rather
than
as
an
ordinary
ghost
tormenting
the
living
brother
till
shadow
also
appears
a
portent
of
his
death
the
awful
grip
of
causeless
horror
of
nameless
fear
which
assails
one
so
often
in
nightmares
is
represented
in
red
where
black
fear
the
power
of
darkness
haunts
the
room
rather
than
any
personal
spirit
it
is
disembodied
horror
itself
wilkie
collins
illustrates
the
presaging
vision
of
approaching
disaster
in
dream
the
nightmare
horror
of
supernaturalism
is
nowhere
better
shown
than
in
where
the
sleeper
wakes
with
a
sense
of
leaden
weight
upon
his
breast
and
knows
that
night
after
night
some
dreadful
presence
is
shut
in
with
him
invisible
yet
crushing
the
life
out
of
him
and
driving
him
mad
shadows
on

the
nightmare
motifs
are
present
to
a
remarkable
degree
in
haunted

the

or
the

and
the
there
we
have
the
gigantism
of
the
menacing
thing
the
supernatural
power
given
to
inanimate
objects
the
ghostly
chill
the
darkness
and
the
intolerable
oppression
of
a
nameless
evil
thing
beside

vampirism
might
easily
be
an
outcome
of
dreams

on
a
physical
sensation
of

at

with
debility

by

the

with
the

perhaps
the
more
effective
because

chapter
iii
modern
ghosts
the
ghost
is
the
most
enduring
figure
in
supernatural
fiction
he
is
absolutely
indestructible
he
glides
from
the
pages
of
magazines
and
books
bearing
the
date
of
the
year
of
our
lord
nineteen
hundred
and
seventeen
as
from
the
parchment
rolls
of
ancient
manuscripts
he
appears
as
unapologetically
at
home
in
twentieth
century
fiction
as
in
classical
mythology
christian
hagiology
medieval
legend
or
gothic
romance
he
changes
with
the
styles
in
fiction
but
he
never
goes
out
of
fashion
he
is
the
really
permanent
citizen
of
this
earth
for
mortals
at
best
are
but
transients
even
the
athlete
and
the
methusaleh
must
in
the
end
give
up
the
flesh
but
the
wraith
goes
on
forever
in
form
too
he
wears
well
ghostly
substance
of
materialization
ethereal
and
vaporous
as
it
appears
to
be
is
yet
of
an
astonishing
toughness
it
seems
to
possess
an
obstinate
vitality
akin
to
that
attributed
to
the
boll
weevil
in
a
negro
ballad
that
went
on
undaunted
by
heat
or
cold
rain
or
drought
time
or
tide
the
ghost
like
death
has
all
seasons
for
its
own
and
there
is
no
closed
season
for
spooks
it
is
much
the
case
now
as
ever
that
all
the
world
loves
a
ghost
yet
we
like
to
take
our
ghosts
vicariously
preferably
in
fiction
we
rather
see
than
be
one
one
point
of
difference
between
the
ghostly
fiction
of
the
past
and
of
the
present
is
in
the
matter
of
length
the
gothic
novel
was
often
a
or
affair
in
whose
perusal
the
reader
aged
perceptibly
before
the
ghost
succeeded
or
was
foiled
in
his
haunting
designs
there
was
obviously
much
more
leisure
on
the
part
of
spooks
as
well
as
mortals
then
than
now
consequently
the
ghost
story
of
is
told
in
form
for
the
most
part
poe
knew
better
than
anybody
before
him
what
was
necessary
for
the
proper
economy
of
thrills
when
he
gave
his
dictum
concerning
the
desirable
length
for
a
story
which
rule
applies
more
to
the
ghostly
tale
than
to
any
other
type
for
surely
there
is
needed
the
unity
of
impression
the
definiteness
of
effect
which
only
continuity
in
reading
gives
the
ghostly
narrative
that
is
too
long
loses
in
impressiveness
whether
it
is
altogether
supernatural
or
mixed
with
other
elements
in
either
case
it
is
less
successful
than
the
shorter
more
poignant
treatment
possible
in
the
compressed
form
the
tabloid
ghost
can
communicate
more
thrills
than
the
one
in
diluted
narration
the
apparitions
in
later
english
fiction
fall
naturally
into
several
distinct
classes
with
reference
to
the
reality
of
their
appearance
there
are
the
mistaken
apparitions
there
are
the
purely
subjective
specters
evoked
by
the
psychic
state
of
the
percipients
and
there
are
the
objective
ghosts
independent
of
the
mental
state
of
the
witnesses
appearing
to
persons
who
are
not
mentally
prepared
to
see
them
the
mistaken
ghost
is
an
old
form
for
most
of
interesting
apparitions
belong
to
this
class
and
others
of
the
gothic
writers
used
subterfuge
to
cheat
the
reader
in
the
early
romance
there
was
frequently
deliberate
deception
for
a
definite
purpose
the
ghosts
with
the
histrionic
temperament
using
a
of
phosphorus
bones
and
other
contrivances
to
create
the
impression
of
unearthly
visitation
recent
fiction
is
more
cleverly
managed
than
that
rarely
now
does
one
find
a
story
where
the
is
deliberately
imposed
upon
for
in
most
modern
cases
the
mistake
occurs
by
accident
or
misapprehension
on
the
part
of
the
percipient
for
which
nobody
and
nothing
but
his
own
agitation
is
responsible
yet
there
are
occasional
hoax
ghosts
even
yet
for
example

as
blanche

points
out
in
her
discussion
of
the
short

the
subjective
ghosts
are
legion
in
modern
fiction
they
are
those
evoked
by
the
mental
state
of
the
percipients
so
that
they
become
realities
to
those
beholding
them
the
mind
rendered
morbid
by
grief
or
remorse
is
readily
prepared
to
see
the
spirits
of
the
dead
return
in
love
or
with
reproach
the
apparitions
in
animistic
beliefs
as
in
classical
stories
and
gothic
romance
were
usually
subjective
born
of
brooding
love
or
remorse
or
fear
of
retribution
appearing
to
the
persons
who
had
cause
to
expect
them
and
coming
usually
at
night
when
the
beholders
would
be
alone
and
given
over
to
melancholy
thought
or
else
to
troubled
sleep
shakespeare

he
alone

because
he
had
the
weight
of
murder
on
his

the
subjective
ghost
story
is
difficult
to
write
as
the
effect
must
be
subtly
managed
yet
inescapably
impressive
if
done
well
it
is
admirable
and
there
are
some
writers
who
to
use
henry
james
words
concerning
his
own
work
are
more
interested
in
situations
obscure
and
subject
to
interpretation
than
the
gross
rattle
of
the
foreground
the
reader
as
well
as
the
writer
must
put
himself
in
the
mental
attitude
of
acceptance
of
the
supernatural
else
the
effect
is
lacking

temporary
credulity
kipling
is
an
extraordinary
ghost
story
of
suggestion
rather
than
of
bald
fact
it
is
like
crushing
the
wings
of
a
butterfly
to
analyze
it
but
it
represents
the
story
of
a
man
whose
love
for
his
own
dead
child
enabled
him
to
see
the
spirits
of
other
little
children
because
he
loved
as
the
blind
woman
told
him
only
those
who
were
spiritually
prepared
could
see
them
for

must
bear
or

before

them

any
number
of
instances
might
be
given
of
ghosts
appearing
to
those
who
are
mentally
prepared
to
be
receptive
to
supernatural
visions
but
these
will
serve
to
illustrate
the
type
by
olivia
howard
dunbar
that
objective
ghosts
are
likewise
very
numerous
in
modern
fiction
the
objective
spirits
are
those
that
while
they
may
be
subjective
on
the
part
of
the
persons
chiefly
concerned
to
begin
with
are
yet
visible
to
others
as
well
appearing
not
only
to
those
mentally
prepared
to
see
them
but
to
others
not
thinking
of
such
manifestations
and
even
sceptical
of
their
possibility
the
objective
ghosts
have
more
definite
visibility
more
reality
than
the
purely
subjective
spirits
they
are
more
impressive
as
haunters
there
is
a
plausibility
a
corporeality
about
the
later
apparitions
that
shows
their
advance
over
the
diaphanous
phantoms
of
the
past
ghosts
that
eat
and
drink
play
cards
dance
duel
and
do
anything
they
wish
that

so
lifelike
in
their
materialization
that
they
would

a
medium

more
terrifying
than
the
helpless
specters
of
early
times
that
could
only
give
orders
for
the
living
to
carry
out
the
modern
ghost
has
lost
none
of
his
mortal
powers
but
has
gained
additional
supermortal
abilities
which
gives
him
an
unsportsmanlike
advantage
over
the
mere
human
being
he
may
take

a
remarkable

of

be
given
by

whether

be
mistaken
subjective
or
objective
their
appearance
has
always
elicited
considerable
interest
on
the
part
of
humanity
their
substance

demeanor
are
matters
of
definite
concern
to
those
who

modern
ghost
sticks
pretty
closely
to
the
animistic
idea

was
that
the

was
a
sort
of
vapory
projection

recognized

a
pallid

though

furnished
one
robust
haunter

gigantic
muscle
yet
for
the
most
part
the
gothic
ghosts
were
misty
wraiths
through
which
the
sword
could
plunge
without
resistance
they
were
fragile
and
helpless
as
an
heroine
when
it
came
to
a
real
emergency
and
were
useful
chiefly
for
frightening
the
guilty
and
consoling
the
innocent

sits
up

with
ghastly
fingers
unfolds
its

to

the
counterpart
of

at
him
with
the
eyes
he
had
worshiped
in
his
boyhood
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
her
and
kissed
what
not
the
feet
of
my
mother

those
of
the
dead
sick
with
repulsion
and
fear
i
looked
up
and
there
bending
over
me

peering
into
my
eyes
was
the
face
the
fleshless
mouldering
face
of
the
foul
corpse

on
the
whole
though
skeletons
do
appear
in

fiction
the
rattle
of
bones
is
not
heard
as
often
as
in
gothic
times
ghostly
apparitions
are
more
varied
in
form
than
in
early
times
the
modern
ghost
does
not
require
a
whole
skeleton
for
his
purposes
but
he
can
take
a
single
bone
and
put
the
hardiest
to
flight
with

those

the

hideous
revenge
ghost
manifested
in
a
peculiar
form
a
couple
of
men
take
refuge
in
a
deserted
house
and
note
a
strange
vine
covering
the
porch
that
shakes
unaccountably
and
violently
in
mystification
they
dig
it
up
to
find
the
roots
in
the
form
of
a
woman
body
lacking
one
foot
as
had
been
the
case
with
the
woman
who
had
lived
there
and
whose
husband
had
killed
her
secretly
and
buried
her
beside
the
porch
the
revenge
ghost
in
modern
fiction
frequently
manifests
itself
in
this
form
mutilated
or
dismembered
each
disfigurement
of
the
mortal
body
showing
itself
in
a
relentless
immortality
and
adding
to
the
horror
of
the
haunting
there
seems
to
be
no
seat
of
ghostly
mind
or
soul
for
the
body
can
perform
its
function
of
haunting
in
whole
or
in
part
unaided
by
the
head
or
heart
like
a
section
of
a
snake
that
has
life
apart
from
the
main
body
and
this
idea
of
detached
part
of
the
form
acting
as
a
determined
agent
for
revenge
adds
a
new
horror
to
fiction
i
have
as
yet
found
an
instance
of
a
woman
heart
bleeding
and
broken
coming
up
all
by
itself
to
haunt
the
deserting
lover
but
perhaps
such
stories
will
be
written
soon
and
think
what
terrors
would
await
the
careless
physician
or
surgeon
if
each
outraged
organ
or
dismembered
limb
came
back
to
seek
vengeance
on
him
ghosts
of
modern
fiction
are
more
convincing
in
their
reality
than
the
specters
of
early
times
they
are
stronger
more
vital
there
seems
to
be
a
strengthening
of
ghostly
tissue
a
stiffening
of
supernatural
muscle
in
these
days
ghosts
are
more
healthy
more
active
more
alive
than
they
used
to
be
there
is
now
as
before
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
personality
before
death
the
same
immortality
of
looks
that
is
discouraging
to
the
prospects
of
homely
persons
who
have
hoped
to
be
more
handsome
in
a
future
state
fiction
gives
no
basis
for
such
hope
peculiarities
of
appearance
are
carried
over
with
distressing
faithfulness
to
detail
each
freckle
each
wrinkle
each
gray
hair
showing
with
the
clearness
of
a
photographic
proof
note
the
lifelikeness
of
the
governess
description
of
peter
quint
in
turn
of
the
he
has
red
hair
very
red
very
and
a
pale
face
long
in
shape
with
straight
good
features
and
little
queer
whiskers
that
are
as
red
as
his
hair
his
eyebrows
are
somehow
darker
and
particularly
arched
as
if
they
might
move
a
good
deal
his
eyes
are
sharp
strange
awful
his
mouth
is
wide
his
lips
thin
this
seems
an
unspectral
description
for
red
hair
is
not
yet
a
ghost
that
lifted
its
eyebrows
unnaturally
would
be
alarming
she
says
of
him
he
was
absolutely
on
this
occasion
a
living
dangerous
detestable
presence
each
minor
disfigurement
is
retained
as
the
loss
of
the
tooth
in
crawford
screaming
skull
the
missing
toe
in
bierce
toe
of
the
right
the
lacking

in

and
so
forth
nothing
is
neglected
to
make
identification
absolute
in
present
tales
of
horror
the
spirits
described
by
bram
stoker
have
red
voluptuous

and

turned

jessie
adelaide
middleton
shows
us
one
ghost
with
half
a
face
ghostly
apparel
constitutes
an
interesting
feature
of
supernaturalism
in
literature
there
seem
to
be
as
definite
conventions
concerning
spectral
clothes
as
regarding
the
garb
of
the
living
fashionables
it
is
more
difficult
to
understand
the
immortality
of
clothes
than
of
humanity
for
bodily
tissue
even
of
ghosts
might
quite
conceivably
renew
itself
but
not
so
with
the
ghostly
garments
of
what
stuff
are
made
and
why
do
they
never
wear
out
in
olden
times
when
people
wore
clothes
of
less
radical
styles
than
now
and
fewer
of
them
masculine
spirits
were
in
part
identified
by
their
familiar
armor
armor
is
so
material
and
heavy
that
it
seems
incongruous
to
the
ghostly
function
yet
shields
and
accouterments
were
necessary
accompaniments
of
every
knightly
spook
he
must
be
ever
ready
to
tilt
with
rival
ghost
the
gothic
phantoms
were
well
panoplied
and
one
remembers
particularly
the
giant
armor
in
walpole
novel
nowadays
the
law
forbids
the
carrying
of
weapons
which
restriction
seems
to
have
been
extended
to
ghostdom
as
well
specters
are
thus
placed
at
a
disadvantage
for
one
would
scarcely
expect
to
see
even
the
wraith
of
a
texas
toting
a
pistol
specters
usually
appear
in
the
garments
in
which
the
beholder
saw
them
last
in
life
styles
seem
petrified
at
death
so
that
ghosts
now
look
like
figures
from
the
movies
or
guests
at
a
masquerade
ball
one
other
point
to
be
noted
is
that
women
phantoms
are
frequently
seen
in
black
or
in
white
white
seems
reminiscent
of
the
shroud
as
well
as
of
youth
and
innocence
so
is
appropriate
while
black
connotes
gloom
so
is
suitable
yet
the
really
favored
color
is
gray
most
of
the
specters
this
season
are
dressed
in
gray
i
scarcely
know
why
this
is
affected
by
shades
yet
the
fact
remains
that
many
wraiths
both
men
and
women
are
thus
attired
gray
is
the
tone
that
witches
of
modern
tastes
choose
also
whereas
their
ancient
forbears
went
in
black
and
red
modern
ghosts
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
matter
of
clothes
compared
with
the
earlier
ones
since
the
styles
now
change
so
quickly
and
so
decidedly
that
a
ghost
is
hopelessly
before
he
has
time
to
materialize
at
all
in
most
instances
examples
of
ghostly
garments
in
later
fiction
evidence
their
variety
katherine
fullerton
gerould
shows
us
three
ghosts
one
of
a
woman
in
a
blue
dress
one
of
a
rattlesnake
and
one
of
a
zulu
warrior
wearing
only
a
a
and
a
scowl
we
do
not
often
see
the
nude
in
ghosts
perhaps
because
they
have
a
shade
of
modesty
depicts
a
man
clad
in
the
wraith
of
a
tweed
suit
with
those
familiar
matthew
arnold
in
addition
to
morley
buttons
which
we
glanced
through
him
to
see
we
observe
that
he
wears
ghostly
spectacles
a
tights
and
boots
and
a
prim
in
kipling
we
see
the
glint
of
a
small
boy
blue
blouse
while
another
kipling
youngster
a
struts
around
in
his
comical
first
trousers
which
he
would
not
be
robbed
of
even
by
the
german
soldiers
that
murdered
him
other
children
in
the
same
story
are
said
to
have
on
disgracefully
dirty
clothes
i
do
not
recall
any
soilure
on
gothic
garments
save
spectral
and
the
mold
of
graves
neither
did
i
discover
any
child
wraith
in
gothicism
save
the
pitiful
spirits
of
baby
victims
in
and
the
baby
wraiths

the
englishman
driven
mad
by
the
apparition
of
the
woman
he
has
wronged
in
kipling
story
is
described
by
him
as
wearing
the
dress
in
which
i
saw
her
last
alive
she
carried
the
same
tiny
handkerchief
in
her
right
hand
and
the
same
in
her
left
a
woman
eight
months
dead
with

shows
us
a
ghost
in
purple
and
velvet
coat
in
gray
the
returning
napoleon
wears
a
long
military
cloak
of
gray
and

dressed
in
brown
and
sits
stolidly
and
silently
on
the
side
of
the
bed
with
its
back
turned
think
of
being
haunted
by
an
unbudging
brown
back
no
wonder
it
drove
the
young
husband
to
spend
his
wedding
night
huddled
on
the
stairs
we
have
instances
of
a
ghost
in
a
red
vest
a
relentless
revenge
spirit
that
hounds
from
ocean
to
ocean
his
murderer
and
the
betrayer
of
his
daughter
and
another
of
a
ghost
in
a
red
shirt
there
is
on
the
whole
as
much
variety
and
appropriateness
of
costume
in
modern
ghost
fiction
as
in
broadway
melodrama
in
the
by
converse
in
and
by
laurence
clarke
another
point
of
difference
between
the
specters
of
and
those
of
the
past
is
in
the
extension
of
their
avenues
of
approach
to
us
ghostly
appeal
to
the
senses
is
more
varied
now
than
in
earlier
times
the
classical
as
well
as
the
gothic
ghosts
appealed
in
general
only
to
the
sight
and
hearing
as
well
as
of
course
to
the
sixth
sense
that
realizes
the
presence
of
a
supernatural
being
ghosts
were
seen
and
heard
and
were
content
with
that
but
nowadays
more
points
of
contact
are
open
to
them
and
they
haunt
us
through
the
touch
the
smell
as
well
as
sight
and
hearing
the
taste
as
a
medium
of
impression
has
not
yet
been
exploited
by
fiction
writers
though
doubtless
it
will
be
worked
out
soon
there
is
a
of
the
skibos
that
wolves
eat
ghosts
and
find
them
very
appetizing
and
the
devil
in
poe
says
he
eats
the
spirits
of
mortals
one
might
imagine
what
haunting
dyspepsia
could
result
if
an
spook
were
devoured
against
his
will
it
is
conceivable
too
that
gastronomic
ghosts
might
haunt
cannibals
and
who
knows
that
the
dark
brown
taste
in
the
mouths
of
riotous
livers
is
not
some
specter
striving
to
express
itself
through
that
medium
instead
of
being
riotous
livers
the
appeal
of
ghosts
to
the
sight
has
already
been
discussed
so
need
not
be
mentioned
here
but
the
element
of
invisibility
enters
in
as
a
new
and
very
terrible
form
of
supernatural
manifestation
in
later
fiction
in
spite
of
the
general
visibility
some
of
the
most
horrible
tales
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
haunter
is
unseen
wells
is
a
human
being
not
a
ghost
yet
the
story
has
a
curdling
power
that
few
straight
ghost
stories
possess
maupassant
is
a
nightmare
story
of
an
invisible
being
that
is
terrific
in
its
effect
the
victim
knows
that
an
unseen
yet
definite
and
determined
something
is
shut
in
his
room
with
him
night
after
night
eating
drinking
reading
sitting
on
his
chest
driving
him
mad
ambrose
bierce
damned
is
a
gruesome
story
of
invisibility
of
a
something
that
is
abroad
with
unearthly
power
of
evil
whose
movements
can
be
measured
by
the
bending
of
the
grasses
which
shuts
off
the
light
from
other
objects
as
it
passes
which
struggles
with
the
dogs
and
with
men
till
it
finally
kills
and
horribly
mangles
the
man
who
has
been
studying
it
but
is
never
seen
another
has
for
its
central
figure
a
being
that
violently
attacks
men
and
is
overpowered
and
tied
only
by
abnormal
strength
that
struggles
on
the
bed
showing
its
imprint
on
the
mattress
that
is
imprisoned
in
a
plaster
cast
to
have
its
mold
taken
that
is
heard
breathing
loudly
till
it
dies
of
starvation
yet
is
absolutely
never
visible
blackwood
fire
elemental
may
be
seen
moving
along
only
by
the
bending
of
the
grass
beneath
it
and
by
the
trail
it
leaves
behind
for
though
it
is
audible
yet
it
is
never
seen
as
a
brave
man
said
of
it
i
am
not
afraid
of
anything
that
i
can
so
these
stories
of
supernatural
invisibility
have
a
chilling
horror
more
intense
than
that
of
most
ghostly
tales
the
element
of
invisibility
of
unmistakably
present
spirits
is
shown
in
other
stories
was
it
a
by
one
tender
story
of
an
invisible
ghost
is
told
in
no
strange
of
a
man
killed
suddenly
in
a
wreck
while
on
his
way
home
to
the
birthday
dinner
his
wife
is
preparing
for
him
he
does
not
know
that
he
has
been
hurt
but
while
his
dead
body
lies
mangled
under
the
wreckage
his
spirit
hurries
home
he
swears
whimsically
under
his
breath
at
some
interruption
and
thinks
with
joy
of
the
happy
little
group
he
will
meet
but
when
he
enters
his
home
he
can
not
make
them
see
or
hear
him
they
are
vaguely
aware
of
some
strange
influence
are
awed
by
it
and
the
little
son
with
the
poet
heart
whispers
that
he
hears
something
but
that
is
all
the
man
stands
by
impotently
stretching
out
his
arms
to
them
till
he
hears
the
messenger
tell
them
that
he
is
dead
by
katherine
butler
ghosts
are
variable
with
respect
to
sounds
as
well
as
appearance
the
early
ghosts
were
for
the
most
part
silent
yet
could
talk
on
occasion
and
classical
apparitions
were
sometimes
vocal
and
sometimes
silent
the
gothic
ghost
sometimes
had
an
impediment
in
his
speech
while
at
other
times
he
could
converse
fluently
the
gothic
specter
real
as
well
as
faked
frequently
lifted
voice
in
song
and
brought
terror
to
the
guilty
bosom
by
such
strains
yet
when
he
spoke
he
was
usually
brief
in
utterance
perhaps
the
reason
for
that
lay
in
the
lack
of
surety
on
the
part
of
the
writers
as
to
the
proper
ghostly
diction
gothic
authors
were
not
overstrong
on
technique
and
they
may
have
hesitated
to
let
their
specters
be
too
fluent
lest
they
be
guilty
of
dialectic
errors
it
would
seem
incongruous
for
even
an
illiterate
ghost
to
murder
the
king
english
which
presents
a
difficulty
in
the
matter
of
realism
so
perchance
the
writers
dodged
the
issue
by
giving
their
ghosts
brevity
of
speech
or
in
some
cases
by
letting
them
look
volumes
of
threats
but
utter
no
word
this
may
explain
the
reason
for
the
ghosts
in
classical
and
elizabethan
drama
there
is
a
similar
variation
in
the
later
fiction
for
many
of
the
ghosts
are
eloquently
silent
while
other
phantoms
are
terrifyingly
fluent
all
this
goes
to
prove
the
freedom
of
the
modern
ghost
for
he
does
what
he
takes
a
notion
to
do
the
invisible
ghosts
are
as
a
rule
voiceless
as
well
the
gothic
romance
was
fond
of
mysterious
music
as
an
accompaniment
of
supernatural
visitation
but
ghostly
music
is
less
common
than
it
used
to
be
yet
it
does
come
at
times
as
in
where
two
spinster
sisters
living
alone
hear
heavenly
music
as
portent
of
their
death
ghostly
song
is
heard
in
another
case
where
a
spirit
comes
back
to
sing
in
a
duet
at
her
funeral
and
ghost
constantly
whistles
a
tune
he
had
been
fond
of
during
life
in
the
wraith
of
the
young
girl
who
in
cromwellian
times
betrayed
her
father

to
save

in
crawford
doll
that
peculiar
example
of
preternatural
fiction
not
a
children
story
as
one
might
think
nor
yet
humorous
the
mechanical
voice
of
the
doll
and
the
click
of
its
tiny
pattering
feet
occur
as
strange
sounds
lord
strafford
walks
with
a
firm
audible
tread
on
his
way
to
appall
the
king
and
in
blackwood
the
ghosts
move
with
sounds
of
heavy
rushing
feet
followed
by
a
noise
of
scuffling
and
smothered
screams
as
the
ancient
murder
is
then
the
thud
of
a
body
thrown
down
the
stairs
after
which
is
a
terrible
silence
the
awful
effect
of
a
sudden
silence
after
supernatural
sounds
is
nowhere
shown
more
tensely
than
in
monkey
that
story
of
superlative
power
of
suggestion
when
the
ghostly
visitant
knocks
loudly
at
the
outer
door
we
feel
the
same
thrill
of
chilling
awe
as
in
the
knocking
at
the
gate
in
macbeth
and
more
for
the
two
who
hear
are
sure
that
this
is
a
presence

back
from
the
dead

when
the
last

breathed

silence

new

the

speaks
of
his

of

sometimes
near
to

he
speaks
of

utterly
happy
chuckle
of
a

absorbed
in
some
light
mischief
sudden
squeaking
giggles
of
childhood
the
rustle
of
a
frock
and
the
patter
of
feet
in
the
room
beyond
joyous
chuckles
of
evasion
and
so
forth
these
essentially
childlike
and
lifelike
sounds
are
deeply
pathetic
as
coming
from
the
ghosts
of
little
ones
that
hover
homesick
near
the
earth
they
dread
to

the
little

himself
invisibly
through
the
little
prancing
steps
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
through
which
he
runs
and
the
imitations
of
an
automobile
later
ghostly
fiction
introduces
few
of
the
clankings
of
chains
and
lugubrious
groans
that
made
the
gothic
romance
mournful
and
the
modern
specters
are
less
wailful
than
the
earlier
but
more
articulate
in
their
expression
there
are
definite
ghostly
sounds
that
recur
in
various
stories
such
as
the
above
the
bed
of
the
dying
the
mocking
laughter
in
empty
places
the
cry
of
the
banshee
which
is
the
presage
of
death
not
only
of
the
body
but
of
the
soul
as
well
on
the
whole
the
sounds
in
modern
supernatural
stories
are
more
varied
in
their
types
more
expressive
of
separate
and
individual
horror
and
with
an
intensified
power
of
haunting
suggestion
than
was
the
case
with
the
earlier
forms
in
nemesis
of
by
blackwood
passing
of
the
sense
of
smell
was
not
noticeably
exploited
in
the
ancient
or
gothic
ghost
stories
though
certain
as
hawaiian
stories
of
the
lower
world
speak
of
it
the
devil
was
supposed
to
be
in
bad
odor
for
he
was
usually
accompanied
by
sulphurous
scents
as
we
notice
in
calderon
drama
and
some
of
the
gothic
novels
but
that
seems
to
be
about
the
extent
of
the
matter
but
moderns
while
not
so
partial
to
brimstone
pay
considerable
attention
to
supernatural
odors
the
devil
has
been
but
the
evil
odors
of
later
fiction
are
more
objectionable
than
the
fumes
of
the
pit
are
more
variant
more
individual
and
distinctive
odors
seem
less
subjective
than
sights
or
sounds
and
are
not
so
conventionalized
in
ghostly
fiction
hence
when
they
are
cleverly
evoked
they
are
unusually
effective
these
supernatural
scents
have
a
very
lasting
quality
too
for
they
linger
on
after
the
other
manifestations
of
the
preternatural
are
past
in

the
ghost
manifests
itself
through
the
nostrils
in

there
is
an
awful
stench
for
which
no
one
can
account
and
which
can
not
be
removed
by
any
disinfectants
finally
when
a
woman
especially
sympathetic
to
a
man
mysteriously
dead
is
put
in
the
room
the
ghost
appears
as
a
decaying
head
floating
near
the
ceiling
and
emitting
an
intolerable
odor

of
a
strange
foul
sea
odor
that
infests
a
certain
stateroom
and
that
no

definite
foul

with

as
that
ghost
of
an
unforgettable
strange

of
a
queer
acrid
pungent
smell

announces
the

awful

of

a
whiff
of
perfume
where
the
spirit
of
the
dead
woman
brings
with
it
flowers
in
masses
with
a
heavenly
perfume
which
lingers
after
the
spirit
in
visible
form
has
departed
the
subtlest
and
most
delicately
haunting
story
of
this
type
is
henry
where
the
loved
dead
girl
reveals
herself
to
the
man
who
is
desperately
hunting
the
big
city

for

merely
as
a
whiff
of

the
flower
she
most
loved
as
in

by
alice

but
it
is
through
the
sense
of
touch
that
the
worst
form
of
haunting
comes
seeing
a
supernatural
visitant
is
terrible
hearing
him
is
direful
smelling
him
is
loathsome
but
having
him
touch
you
is
the
climax
of
horror
this
element
comes
in
much
in
recent
stories
the
earlier
ghosts
seemed
to
be
more
reserved
to
know
their
spectral
place
better
were
not
so
ready
to
presume
on
unwelcome
familiarities
as
those
in
later
fiction
but
spooks
have
doubtless
followed
the
fashion
of
mortals
in
this
easy
relaxed
age
and
have
become
a
shade
too
free
in
their
manners
of
course
one
remembers
the
crushing
specter
in
otranto
castle
that
flattened
the
hapless
youth
out
so
effectually
and
there
are
other
instances
less
striking
but
as
a
general
thing
the
gothic
ghost
was
content
to
stand
at
a
distance
and
hurl
curses
fortunately
for
our
ancestors
nerves
he
did
not
incline
much
to
the
laying
on
of
hands
modern
ghosts
however
have
not
been
taught
to
restrain
their
impulses
and
they
venture
on
liberties
that
radcliffian
romance
would
have
disapproved
of
damned
gives
an
example
of
muscular
supernaturalism
for
the
mysterious
being
kills
a
dog
in
a
stiff
fight
then
later
slays
the
master
after
a
terrible
struggle
in
which
the
man
is
disfigured
beyond
words
to
describe
shows
a
terrible
being
of
abnormal
power
that
is
tied
only
after
a
tremendous
effort
and
which
fights
violently
to
free
itself
and
the
thing
in
the
upper
berth
had
an
awesome
strength
it
was
something
ghostly
horrible
beyond
words
and
it
moved
in
my
grasp
it
was
like
the
body
of
a
man
long
dead
and
yet
it
moved
and
had
the
strength
of
ten
men
living
but
i
gripped
it
with
all
my
might
the
slippery
oozy
horrible
thing
i
wrestled
with
the
dead
thing
it
thrust
itself
upon
me
and
nearly
broke
my
arms
it
wound
its
corpselike
arms
around
my
neck
the
living
death
and
overpowered
me
so
that
at
the
last
i
cried
aloud
and
fell
and
left
my
hold
as
i
fell
the
thing
sprang
across
me
and
seemed
to
throw
itself
upon
the
captain
when
i
last
saw
him
on
his
feet
his
face
was
white
and
his
lips
set
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
struck
a
violent
blow
at
the
dead
being
and
then
he
too
fell
forward
on
his
face
the
ghostly
touch
is
frequently
described
not
only
in
fiction
but
in
reports
of
the
psychical
society
as
well
as
being
of
supernatural
chill
or
of
burning
heat
brings
in
the
icy
touch
of
the
spirit
hand
in
certain
cases
the
ghost
touch
leaves
a
burn
or
mark
that
never
goes
away
by
fred
smale
yet
the
touch
of
horror
is
not
the
only
one
introduced
in
fiction
of
the
supernatural
there
are
tender
and
loving
touches
as
well
expressing
yearning
love
and
a
longing
to
communicate
with
the
living
what
could
be
more
beautiful
than
the
incident
in
i
felt
my
relaxed
hand
taken
and
turned
softly
between
the
soft
hands
of
a
child
the
little
brushing
kiss
fell
in
the
center
of
my
palm
as
gift
on
which
the
fingers
were
expected
to
close
a
fragment
of
a
mute
code
devised
very
long
ago
and
in
a
similar
story
the
woman
says
i
will
swear
to
my
dying
day
that
two
little
hands
stole
and
rested
for
a
moment
only
in
mine
wilkie
collins
speaks
of
his
story
ghost
as
follows
the
course
of
this
narrative
leads
the
reader
on
new
and
strange
ground
it
describes
the
return
of
a
disembodied
spirit
to
earth
not
occurring
in
the
obscurity
of
midnight
but
in
the
searching
light
of
day
neither
seen
as
a
vision
nor
heard
as
a
voice
revealing
itself
to
mortal
knowledge
through
the
sense
that
is
least
easily
the
sense
that
feels
pair
of
by
the
widow
feels
the
clasp
of
her
husband
hands
not
only
psychically
but
physically
and
when
she
asks
for
a
further
sign
the
ghost
kisses
her
unmistakably
on
the
lips
another
widow
feels
her
hand
clasped
by
the
hand
of
her
husband
who
has
mysteriously
disappeared
after
having
presumably
absconded
with
trust
funds
and
knows
that
he
is
dead
and
seeking
to
give
her
some
message
his
hand
gently
leads
her
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
he
has
fallen
over
and
been
killed
so
that
she
may
know
the
truth
the
lover
in
poe
feels
a
spiritual
kiss
from
the
lips
of
his
beloved
the
ghost
touch
is
an
impressive
motif
of
strength
in
recent
fiction
and
marks
an
advance
over
the
earlier
forms
showing
an
access
of
imaginative
power
and
psychological
analysis
in

by
hugh
conway
another
point
of
contrast
between
the
modern
and
the
older
ghosts
is
in
the
greater
freedom
enjoyed
by
those
of
the
ghosts
of
our
ancestors
were
weak
and
helpless
creatures
in
the
main
and
the
gothic
specter
was
tyrannized
over
to
such
an
extent
that
he
hardly
dared
call
his
shade
his
own

spook
of

acquired
a
latchkey
and
asserted
his
independence

may
have
a
local

but
he
is
obliged
to
stay
there
even
the
spectral
women
are
setting
up
to
be
feminists
and
have
privileges
that
would
have
caused
the
gothic
wraiths
to
swoon
with
horror
ghosts
are
not
so
sensitive
to
the
barometer
now
as
they
used
to
be
nor
do
they
have
such
an
active
influence
over
the
weather
as
did
the
gothic
phantoms
they
do
not
need
a
tempest
for
their
materialization
nor
a
supernatural
play
of
lightning
for
their
wild
threats
and
comparatively
few
storms
occur
in
later
fiction
yet
there
is
certainly
no
lessening
of
the
ghostly
thrill
in
consequence
neither
are
the
spirits
of
limited
to
any
set
hours
as
was
the
rule
in
gothicism
the
tyranny
of
the
dark
the
autocratic
rule
of
twelve
or
one

the
arbitrary

katherine

interesting

of
ghosts
that
come
at
eleven
in

out
on

that
appear
in
daylight
and
in
the
open

ghosts
in
modern
fiction
are
not
dependent
upon
a
setting
of
sullen
scenery
as
in
gothicism
but
may
choose
any
surroundings
they
like
since
modern
household
arrangements
do
not
include
family
vaults
as
a
general
thing
and
since
cemeteries
are
inconveniently
located
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
haunters
to
desert
such
quarters
mary
wilkins

the
specter
complains
loudly
of
the
unsentimental
mind
of
the

has
lost
interest
in
ghosts
and
leaves
in
disgust
likewise
the
domination
of
the
gothic
castles
those
edifices
has
passed
away
and
modern
spooks
are
not
confined
to
any
one
locality
as
in
the
past
they
appear
where
they
will
in
the
most
prosaic
places

a
number
of
thrilling
ghost
stories
out
in

open
in
the
woods
in
the
desert
sand
wastes
and
similar
places
one
effect
of
such
realistic
and
unspectral
setting
is
to
give
a
greater
verisimilitude
to
the
events
described
and
the
modern
tale
bears
out
leigh
hunt
suggestion
that
a
ghost
story
to
be
a
good
one
should
unite
as
much
as
possible
objects
as
they
are
in
life
with
a
preternatural
spirit
yet
here
are
ghosts
that
do
haunt
certain
rooms
as
relentlessly
as
ever
gothic
specter
did
by
lloyd
the
modern
ghost
has
power
over
certain
localities
rather
than
mere
houses
or
apartments
if
the
house
he
calls
his
own
is
torn
down
he
bides
his
time
and
haunts
the
new
structure
built
on
the
same
spot
or
if
no
new
house
goes
up
he
hangs
around
and
haunts
the
vacant
lot
which
is
a
more
reprehensible
procedure
than
the
ordinary
habits
of
spooks
one
story
concerns
a
house
so
persistently
ghosted
that
its
owner
took
it
down
section
by
section
trying
to
arrive
at
the
location
of
the
curse
but
to
no
avail

the
whole
building
had
been
razed
and

site

then
the
owner
left
in
disgust
algernon
blackwood
is
fond
of
situations
where
localities
are
haunted
by
evil
spirits
where
a
whole
village
is
inhabited
by
the
ghosts
of
witches
or
that
relates
the
experience
of
a
man
who
wanders
within
the
limits
of
a
place
made
horrible
by
but
and
inhabiting
a
house
that
has
been
torn
down
years
before
but
appears
as
usual
where
they
entrap
the
souls
of
the
living
for
their
fiendish
sacrifice
another
is
the
record
of
a
spirit
of
frightful
evil
that
haunts
a
house
built
on
the
spot
where
an
older
house
once
stood
whose
diabolism
lingers
on
to
curse
the
living
the
spirit
that
haunts
a
locality
rather
than
one
room
or
house
has
a
more
malignant
power
than
the
more
restricted
ghost
and
this
adds
a
new
element
of
definite
supernaturalism
to
modern
fiction
but
as
houses
are
so
much
less
permanent
now
than
formerly
ghosts
would
be
at
a
terrible
disadvantage
if
they
had
to
be
evicted
every
time
a
building
was
torn
down
as
in
psychic
ghostly
psychology
is
a
fascinating
study
the
development
of
spectral
personality
is
one
of
the
evident
facts
gained
from
a
historical
survey
of
supernatural
fiction
the
modern
ghost
has
more
individuality
more
distinctiveness
in
the
main
than
his
forbears
the
ghosts
of
medievalism
of
ancient
superstition
and
the
drama
were
for
the
most
part
pallid
colorless
beings
in
character
as
in
materialization
the
ancient
ghosts
were
more
mournful
than
the
moderns
since
the
state
of
the
dead
in
early
times
was
by
no
means
enviable
the
most
one
could
hope
for
then
was
hades
while
the
spirits
who
had
been
buried
could
find
entrance
even
there
but
were
forced
by
relentless
spectral
police
to
keep
forever
moving
the
christian
religion
furnishes
a
more
cheerful
outlook
so
in
later
manifestations
the
gloom
is
considerably
lightened
yet
even
so
the
gothic
ghosts
were
morbid
specters
not
much
happier
than
the
unlucky
wights
they
felt
it
their
business
to
haunt
their
visages
their
clanking
chains
and
other
accompaniments
of
woe
betokened
anything
but
cheer
there
are
some
unhappy
spirits
in
recent
fiction
but
not
such
a
large
proportion
as
in
the
past
and
there
is
usually
some
basis
for
their
joylessness
they
do
have
general
melancholia
with
no
grounds
for
it
the
ghost
of
the
dead
wife
in
is
miserable
because
she
has
never
understood
her
husband
either
in
life
or
in
death
and
she
comes
back
seeking
an
explanation
another
spectral
woman
is
wretched
because
she
has
the
double
crime
of
murder
and
suicide
on
her
soul
poor
marley
grieves
because

there
is

that
is
unhappy
because
his

lies
unburied
a
recurrence
of
a
theme
frequent
in
classical
stories
and
gothic
romance
but
rare
in
later
fiction
for
the
most
part
the
later
ghosts
are
something
more
than
merely
unhappy
spirits
they
are
more
positive
more
active
more
individualistic
too
philosophical
to
waste
time
in
useless
grieving
by
austin
in
closed
by
queen
of
nor
are
there
many
simply
happy
spirits
perhaps
because
the
joyous
souls
are
likely
to
seek
their
paradise
and
forget
about
the
earth
yet
there
are
instances
such
as
the
spirits
of
children
in
various
stories
that
with
the
resilience
of
childhood
shake
off
gloom
and
are
gay
rosamond

comes
back
to
tell
her
friend
how
happy
the
other
life
is
the
peacefully
content
mother
and
others
in
and
in
that
the
ghosts
that
are
actively
vicious
are
the
most
vivid
and
numerous
in
later
fiction
the
spirits
of
evil
seem
to
have
a
terrible
cumulative
force
being
far
more
maleficent
than
the
earlier
ones
and
more
powerful
in
carrying
out
their
purposes
every
aspect
of
supernaturalism
seems
to
be
keyed
up
to
a
higher
pitch
of
terror
evil
seems
to
have
a
strangely
greater
power
of
immortality
over
that
of
good
judging
from
the
proportion
employed
in
modern
fiction
has
evil
so
much
more
strength
of
will
so
much
more
permanence
of
power
that
it
lives
on
through
the
years
and
centuries
while
good
deeds
perish
with
the
body
it
would
appear
so
from
fiction
the
ghosts
of
good
actions
do
not
linger
round
the
abode
of
the
living
to
any
noticeable
extent
but
evil
deeds
are
deathless
we
have
many
stories
of
places
and
persons
haunted
by
the
embodied
evil
of
the
past
but
few
by
the
embodied
good
the
revenge
ghosts
outnumber
the
grateful
dead
by
legions
modern
specters
have
a
more
complex
power
than
the
old
they
are
more
awful
in
their
import
for
they
haunt
not
merely
the
body
but
the
soul
the
wicked
spirits

to
work
dreadful
harm
to
the

as
well
as

blackwood

the
deathlessness
of

is
shown
in

in

of

as
where

here
haunters
and
the
few
writers
have
equaled
marion
crawford
in
the
modern
ghost
story
his
tales
have
a
curdling
intensity
a
racking
horror
that
set
them
far
above
the
ordinary
supernatural
fiction
they
linger
in
the
mind
long
after
one
has
tried
in
vain
to
forget
them
if
indeed
one
ever
does
forget
their
sense
of
evil
power
there
is
in
each
of
his
stories
an
individual
horror
that
marks
it
as
distinct
from
its
fellows
a
power
chiefly
won
by
delineation
of
this
immortality
of
evil
as
in
dead
with
its
description
of
the
hideous
smile
that
pollutes
the
lips
of
the

of

unconscious
sin
henry
james
has
drawn
for
us
two
characters
of
unmitigated
evil
in
peter
quint
and
miss
jessel
who
he
says
are
hovering
prowling
blighting
presences
they
are
agents
on
whom
is
laid
the
dire
duty
of
causing
the
air
to
reek
with
evil
he
says
i
recognize
that
they
are
not
ghosts
at
all
as
we
now
know
the
ghost
but
goblins
elves
imps
demons
the
essence
of
the
matter
was
the
villainy
of
the
motive
in
the
evoked
predatory
creature
what
he
wishes
to
do
in
this
story
is
to
express
a
general
sense
of
spiritual
infamy
not
specialized
as
the
hot
breath
of
the
pit
usually
confines
itself
to
some
one
particular
psychical
brutality
but
as
capable
of
everything
the
worst
that
can
be
conceived
how
well
he
has
succeeded
in
his
effort
those
who
know
the
story
can
testify
ambrose
bierce
stories
are
in
many
instances
remarkable
examples
of
this
psychic
horror
death
of
halpin
has
a
touch
of
almost
unbearable
dreadfulness
frazer
is
assaulted
by
an
evil
spirit
in
a
wood
at
night
and
choked
to
death
the
spirit
inhabiting
the
dead
body
of
the
man
own
mother
who
has
idolized
him
his
dead
face
transfixed
with
diabolical
hate
is
thrust
upon
him
and
the
loved
hands
that
have
caressed
him
strangle
him
this
is
similar
to
the
situation
of
an
evil
spirit
occupying
the
body
of
a
loved
dead
mother
in
mummy
by
elliot
bierce
stories
beat
upon
the
mind
like
bludgeons
and
his
morbid
plots
are
among
the
most
dreadful
in
our
literature
one
wonders
what
abnormality
of
mind
conceives
such
themes
evolves
such
situations
if
it
be
true
as
macaulay
suggests
that
not
only
every
poet
but
every
person
who
appreciates
poetry
is
slightly
unbalanced
mentally
surely
every
writer
of
such
extreme
and
horrific
stories
must
be
abnormal
there
is
more
than
one
writer
of
modern
ghostly
fiction
of
whom
it
might
be
said
that
his
soul
is
open
on
the
hell
side
another
temperament
found
distinctively
in
the
later
fiction
is
the
humorous
ghost
he
is
a
recent
development
and
as
might
be
supposed
is
characteristically
american
there
were
a
few
burlesque
ghosts
in
elizabethan
drama
the
ghost
of
jack
for
instance
and
one
colored
ghost
that
would
seem
to
connote
mirth
but
the
really
humorous
specter
did
not
come
till
later
it
remained
for
the
yankee
to
evoke
the
spook
with
a
sense
of
humor
ghosts
are
not
essentially
laughable
and
to
make
them
comic
without
coarseness
or
irreverence
is
an
achievement
numerous
writers
have
busied
their
pens
with
the
funny
spook
and
now
we
have
ghostly
laughter
that
is
mirthful
and
not
horrisonous
as
in
other
types
specters
now
laugh
with
us
instead
of
at
us
and
instead
of
the
mocking
laughter
heard
in
lonely
places
we
have
mirth
washington

who
resent
being

this
is
the
only
instance
i
have
found
of

john
kendrick

devotes
several
volumes
to
the
doings

sayings
of
spooks
describing
parties
in

where
the
shades
of
the
departed
great
gather
together
and
engage
in
festivities
and
discussions
and
showing
types
of
and
various
kinds
of
spooks
the
humorous
ghost
is
a
more
frequent
person
than
one
would
suppose
without
giving
some
thought
to
the
subject
for
many
writers
have
sharpened
their
wits
on
the
comic
haunt
as
may
be
seen
from
the
examples
mentioned
the
ghost
has
made
perceptible
progress
in
psychology
the
modern
apparition
is
much
more
complex
in
personality
than
the
crude
early
type
and
shows
much
more
variety
the
spook
who
has
a
chance
to
talk
things
over
with
william
james
and
knows
the
labyrinths
of
the
human
mind
is
much
better
adapted
to
inflict
psychal
terrors
than
the
illiterate
specter
of
the
past
he
can
evolve
mental
tortures
more
subtle
and
varied
than
ever
or
he
can
amuse
a
downcast
mortal
by
his
gambols
stories
of
show
a
decided
advance
over
the
gothic
in
the
matter
of
motives
for
spectral
appearance
there
are
it
is
true
certain
motives
in
common
between
them
but
the
spirit
is
less
limited
for
he
has
gained
the
new
without
loss
of
the
old
if
he
wishes
to
keep
the
old
the
principal
impulse
that
impelled
classical
shades
to
walk
the
earth
was
to
request
burial
since
lacking
that
he
could
not
enter
into
the
abode
of
the
dead
this
appears
frequently
also
in
gothic
romance
it
is
shown
but
little
in
recent
fiction
perhaps
because
the
modern
ghost
is
reconciled
to
cremation
or
is
blithely
indifferent
to
what
becomes
of
his
body
since
it
no
longer
rules
him
queen
of
is
one
of
the
few
instances
of
its
use
in
modern
fiction
for
it
is
a
vanishing
motive
for
the
most
part
gothic
ghosts
were
also
wont
to
return
to
show
the
of
treasure
but
that
too
is
dying
out
as
an
incentive
to
haunting
the
prosaic
explanation
here
may
be
that
now
persons
put
their
treasure
in
safety
deposits
hence
there
is
scant
occasion
for
mystery
concerning
its
location
after
death
gothic
spooks
came
back
on
occasion
to
reveal
parentage
for
parents
like
valuables
were
frequently
mislaid
in
terror
romance
this
is
not
so
important
now
since
vital
statistics
usually
keep
such
matters
duly
recorded
yet
instances
do
sometimes
occur
ghosts
in
the
terror
romance
came
to
make
requests
apart
from
the
petition
for
burial
which
tendency
is
still
observed
on
the
part
of
later
spooks
though
not
to
the
same
extent
as
formerly
the
requests
are
psychologically
interesting
as
they
usually
relate
to
simple
ties
of
affection
illustrated
by
the
who
asks
her
friend
to
take
her
children
gothic
spirits
came
back
often
to
make
revelations
concerning
the
manner
of
their
death
which
is
not
often
the
case
now
though
it
does
sometimes
happen
and
dickens
shows
us
one
ghost
returning
to
influence
the
jury
that
is
trying
a
man
for
murder
specters
used
to
appear
to
forewarn
the
living
against
impending
danger
which
impulse
is
rather
lacking
in
later
fiction
though
it
still
occurs
the
curious
element
of
futurity
enters
into
several
of
these
ghostly
warnings
as
in
dickens
signal
where
the
apparition
presages
the
man
death
as
in
algernon
story
is
related
the
incident
of
a
man
who
saw
the
two
indians
scalp
a
white
man
and
drag
his
body
away
at
last
crying
out
i
saw
the
body
and
face
was
my
warning
spirits
of
futurity
are
seen
in
the
where
each
man
beholds
his
own
destiny
one
seeing
the
spectral
snake
that
afterwards
kills
him
in
a
hunting
expedition
one
the
ghost
of
a
zulu
the
savage
that
almost
destroys
him
some
time
afterwards
and
the
last
the
ghost
of
a
young
woman
in
a
blue
dress
the
woman
whom
he
marries
and
who
hounds
him
to
his
death
she
presently
sees
her
own
fate
too
but
what
it
is
the
author
does
not
tell
us
one
curious
incident
in
the
story
is
the
instantaneous
appearance
on
the
stairs
of
the
woman
herself
and
her
ghostly
double
one
in
a
white
dress
one
in
the
fatal
blue
this
sort
of
spectral
warning
this
wireless
service
for
the
conveyance
of
bad
news
and
hint
of
threatening
danger
serves
to
link
the
ghost
story
of
the
present
with
those
of
the
past
the
records
of
the
psychical
society
show
hundreds
of
such
instances
and
much
use
is
made
in
fiction
of
plots
hinging
on
such
motif
scott
white
lady
of
avenel
appears
as
a
death
portent
as
also
the
in
another
novel
in
in
haunted
the
revenge
ghost
looms
large
in
fiction
as
in
the
drama
he
was
the
most
important
figure
in
elizabethan
as
in
classical
drama
and
shakespeare
ghosts
are
principally
of
that
class
a
terrible
example
of
the
type
is
in
robert
lovell
beddoes
that
extraordinary
example
of
dramatic
supernaturalism
where
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
man
comes
back
embodied
from
the
grave
and
is
an
active
character
to
the
end
of
the
play
he
is
summoned
to
life
through
a
hideous
mistake
the
murderer
having
asked
the
magician
to
call
up
the
spirit
of
his
dead
wife
but
the
body
of
his
victim
having
been
secretly
buried
beside
her
so
that
the
murderer
may
have
no
rest
even
in
the
grave
the
awful
accusing
spirit
rises
to
confront
him
instead
of

in

is
a
turn
of
the
screw
of
her
horrid
revenge
the
revenge
ghost
in
modern
fiction
is
more
varied
in
forms
of
manifestation
at
times
more
subtle
in
suggestion
and
ghostly
psychology
than
the
conventionalized
type
of
the
drama
and
remains
one
of
the
most
dreadful
of
the
forms
of
fear
in
two
military
in
general
the
modern
stories
show
a
greater
intensity
of
power
in
employing
the
motives
that
earlier
forms
had
used
as
well
as
far
greater
range
of
motivation
the
earlier
ghosts
were
limited
in
their
impulses
and
their
psychology
was
comparatively
simple
not
so
with
the
apparitions
of
they
have
a
far
wider
range
of
motives
are
moved
by
more
complex
impulses
and
mixed
motivation
in
many
cases
difficult
to
analyze
the
gothic
ghost
had
some
conscience
about
whom
he
haunted
he
had
too
much
reserve
to
force
himself
needlessly
upon
those
that
had
no
connection
with
his
past
if
he
knew
someone
that
deserved
punishment
for
wrong
done
him
or
his
he
tried
to
haunt
him
and
let
others
alone
the
modern
ghost
is
not
so
considerate
he
is
actuated
in
many
cases
by
sheer
evil
that
wreaks
itself
upon
anyone
in
range
death
gives
a
terrible
immortality
and
access
of
power
to
those
whose
lives
have
been
particularly
evil
and
the
results
are
dangerous
to
society
dark
discarnate
hate
manifests
itself
to
those
within
reach
algernon
blackwood
would
have
us
believe
that
all
around
us
are
reservoirs
of
unspeakable
horror
and
that
any
moment
of
weakness
on
our
part
may
bring
down
the
hosts
of
damnation
upon
us
this
is
illustrated
in
such
stories
as
intent
to
where
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
has
hanged
himself
comes
back
with
hypnotic
power
forcing
others
to
take
their
lives
in
the
same
way
or
in
another
showing
power
exerted
viciously
against
human
beings
in
a
certain
building
or
still
another
where
the
witchcraft
holds
the
village
in
thrall
and
elsewhere
ambrose
bierce
bram
stoker
marion
crawford
and
arthur
machen
have
written
a
number
of
stories
bringing
out
this
side
of
ghostly
psychology
showing
the
bands
of
outlawed
spirits
that
prey
on
society
there
are
spectral
bandits
and
bravos
that
answer
the
call
of
any
force
hostile
to
man
or
act
of
their
own
accord
from
an
impulse
of
malicious
mischief
empty
the
jealous
ghost
is
somewhat
common
of
late
showing
that
human
emotions
are
carried
over
into
the
life
beyond
in
various
stories
we
find
the
dead
wife
interfering
to
prevent
a
second
marriage
or
to
make
life
wretched
for
the
interloper
even
after
the
ceremony
but
the
most
extreme
case
of
jealousy
even
exceeding
the
instance
of
the
man
whose
wife
and
physician
conspired
to
give
him
an
overdose
to
put
him
out
of
the
way
and
who
is
frantic
to
prevent
their
marriage
is
found
in
arnold
bennett
novel
here
the
spirit
of
a
man
who
has
madly
loved
an
haunts
every
suitor
of
hers
and
either
drives
him
to
abandon
his
courtship
or
kills
him
till
finally
the
singer
begs
the
ghost
to
spare
the
man
she
loves
which
he
sadly
does
and
departs
this
is
reminiscent
of
one
of
marie
de
france
the
varying
motives
for
appearance
may
be
illustrated
by
reference
to
a
few
ghosts
in
modern
fiction
such
as
the
woman
who
comes
to
drive
away
a
writer
sense
of
humor
than
which
there
could
be
no
greater
spiritual
brutality
and
set
him
to
writing
vile
debased
tragedies
perhaps
she
has
transferred
her
attentions
to
other
authors
than
the
one
in
the
story
other
instances
are
the
little
gray
ghost
in
cornelia
comer
story
by
that
name
who
impels
a
stranger
to
take
her
child
from
an
orphan
asylum
and
adopt
it
much
against
his
will
the
immortal
lovers
that
haunt
a
woman
who
has
made
a
marriage
of
convenience
which
has
turned
out
to
be
a
marriage
of
inconvenience
for
her
husband
the
talkative
spook
in
andrew
lang
castle
that
discourses
learnedly
on
its
own
materialization
speaking
in
technical
terms
pokes
fun
at
shakespeare
for
the
on
a
winter
night
and
the
cockcrow
in
his
and
but
these
are
perhaps
enough
if
one
may
judge
from
ghostly
fiction
death
subtracts
nothing
from
human
emotion
but
rather
adds
to
it
so
that
the
spectral
impulses
are
more
poignant
and
intense
the
darker
passions
are
retained
with
cumulative
power
and
there
is
a
terrible
immortality
of
hate
of
jealousy
and
revenge
in
psychic
in
long
there
is
no
more
impressive
revenant
than
one
coleridge
gives
in
his
of
the
mournful
phantom
of
abel
appearing
to
cain
and
his
little
son
enos
the
child
says
to
his
father
i
saw
a
man
in
unclean
garments
and
he
uttered
a
sweet
voice
full
of
lamentations
cain
asks
the
unhappy
spirit
but
didst
thou
not
find
favor
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
thy
god
to
which
the
shape
answers
the
lord
is
god
of
the
living
only
the
dead
have
another
god
cain
ran
after
the
shape
and
the
shape
fled
shrieking
over
the
sands
and
the
sands
rose
like
white
mists
behind
the
steps
of
cain
but
the
feet
of
him
that
was
like
abel
disturbed
not
the
sands
one
of
the
most
interesting
phases
of
comparative
is
the
study
of
the
intricate
personality
of
specters
with
respect
to
dual
personality
the
late
supernatural
stories
are
curiously
reminiscent
of
the
animistic
belief
that
a
ghost
is
a
double
of
the
mortal
a
vapory
projection
of
his
actual
body
to
be
detached
at
will
during
life
and
permanently
at
death
i
do
not
know
of
any
instances
of
doubles
in
classical
literature
nor
is
the
idea
used
in
gothic
romance
likewise
shakespeare
ghosts
are
all
spirits
of
persons
safely
dead
it
remained
for
the
modern
writer
with
his
expertness
in
psychology
and
psychiatry
to
evoke
the
ghosts
of
the
living
persons
the
strange
cases
of
dual
personality
and
of
separate
personalities
supernaturally
merged
into
one
and
those
inexplicable
ghosts
of
subliminal
memories
all
these
forms
appear
in
elusive
analysis
in
complex
suggestiveness
in
modern
uncanny
stories
and
constitute
one
of
the
distinct
marks
of
advance
over
the
earlier
types
the
double
a
frequent
figure
in
english
fiction
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
doppelgänger
of
german
numerous
examples
of
dual
personality
of
one
being
appearing
in
two
forms
are
seen
with
different
twists
to
the
idea
yet
much
alike
it
has
been
suggested
that
these
stories
have
their
germinal
origin
in
calderon
play
where
a
man
is
haunted
by
himself
poe
is
a
tense
and
tragic
story
of
a
man
pursued
by
his
double
till
in
desperation
he
kills
him
only
to
realize
that
he
has
slain
his
better
self
his
conscience
his
duplicate
cries
out
henceforward
thou
art
also
dead
dead
to
the
world
to
heaven
and
to
hope
in
me
thou
didst
exist
and
in
my
death
see
by
this
thine
image
which
is
thine
own
how
utterly
thou
hast
murdered
thyself
stevenson

in
the
person
of

the
incarnate
conscience
an
embodiment
of
a
nobler
self
that
leads
him
through
the
labyrinth

to
the
knowledge
of
the
soul
truth
the
stranger
tests
the
murderer
by
offering
him
a
way
of
escape
by

further
crime
to
him
by

him
relentlessly
what
the
consequence
of
each
act
will
be

to

is

the

evil
in

own
nature
with
a

existence

hope
to
express

idea
more
powerfully
than

been
done

of
the

unforgettable

dead
selves
from
the
past
are
different
from
the
doubles
that
are
projections
of
the
living
or
prophetic
specters
of
the
future
and
are
clearly
distinguished
by
francis
parsons
tells
of
a
young
army
officer
who
is
obsessed
by
subliminal
self
the
ghost
of
his
grandfather
he
feels
that
he
his
grandfather
living
another
existence
yet
he
lacks
the
pluck
the
manhood
that
the
old
pioneer
possessed
at
a
crisis
in
his
military
affairs
the
old
frontiersman
comes
visibly
forward
to
give
him
the
courage
that
is
needed
after
which
he
manifests
himself
no
more
the
scene
of
this
subliminal
haunting
is
a
texas
prairie
during
a
border
fight
rather
an
unghostly
setting
yet
one
which
makes
the
supernatural
seem
more
actual
arthur
johnson
presents
the
case
of
a
man
who
sees
the
ghosts
of
ancestral
memory
in
a
vivid
form
he
sees
and
hears
his
own
double
wildly
accuse
his
wife
who
is
the
double
of
his
own
betrothed
after
having
killed
her
lover
his
hand
is
wounded
and
the
fingers
leave
bloodstains
as
they
snatch
at
the
gray
chiffon
round
his
throat
after
a
fit
of
unconsciousness
into
which
he
falls
is
over
the
modern
man
awakes
to
find
his
hand
strangely
wounded
and
on
the
floor
of
the
upper
room
he
picks
up
a
scrap
of
bloodstained
gray
chiffon
blackwood
shows
a
little
girl
obsessed
by
subliminal
memories
she
is
haunted
by
terrible
experiences
in
which
she
says
that
she
and
some
of
those
around
her
have
been
concerned
she
goes
into
convulsions
if
anything
is
fastened
around
her
waist
and
she
cries
out
that
some
cruel
man
has
shut
her
up
in
the
wall
to
die
and
has
cut
off
philip
hands
so
that
he
can
not
save
her
investigations
bring
to
light
the
facts
that
a
ancestress
living
in
the
same
house
had
been
walled
up
alive
by
her
husband
after
he
had
cut
off
her
lover
hands
before
her
face
the
skeleton
is
found
chained
by
the
waist
inside
the
ancient
wall
blackwood
depicts
the
ghosts
of
buried
life
of
a
whole
village
enchanted
by
the
past
and
living
over
again
the
witchcraft
of
the
long
ago
as
john
silence
the
psychic
doctor
tells
of
the
englishman
who
drops
casually
into
the
village
and
is
drawn
into
the
magic
vesin
was
swept
into
the
vortex
of
forces
arising
out
of
the
intense
activities
of
a
past
life
and
lived
over
again
a
scene
in
which
he
had
often
played
a
part
centuries
ago
for
strong
actions
set
up
forces
that
are
so
slow
to
exhaust
themselves
that
they
may
be
said
in
a
sense
never
to
die
in
this
case
they
were
not
complete
enough
to
render
the
illusion
perfect
so
the
little
man
was
confused
between
the
present
and
the
past
in
eberdeen
that
story
of
unusual
psychical
experience
by
two
oxford
women
can
be
explained
on
no
other
basis
than
some
such
theory
as
this
the
book
claims
to
be
a
truthful
account
of
a
happening
at
versailles
where
two
english
women
teachers
and
daughters
of
clergymen
saw
in
broad
daylight
the
ghosts
of
the
past
the
figures
of
marie
antoinette
and
her
court
the
writers
offer
the
explanation
that
they
stumbled
into
a
sort
of
pocket
of
the
unhappy
queen
memories
and
saw
the
past
relived
before
their
eyes
because
she
had
felt
it
so
keenly
and
vividly
long
ago
other
instances
might
be
given
but
these
are
sufficient
to
illustrate
the
type
such
stories
have
a
curious
haunting
power
and
are
among
the
most
effective
narratives
the
idea
is
modern
and
illustrates
the
complexity
of
later
thought
as
compared
with
the
simplicity
of
earlier
times
a
comparative
study
of
ghost
stories
leads
one
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ghost
is
the
most
modern
of
ancients
and
the
most
ancient
of
moderns
in
some
respects
the
present
specter
is
like
and
in
some
unlike
the
previous
forms
ghosts
whether
regarded
as
conjective
or
purely
subjective
are
closely
related
to
the
percipients
thoughts
primitive
times
produced
a
primitive
supernaturalism
and
the
gradual
advance
in
intellectual
development
has
brought
about
a
heightening
and
complexity
of
the
weird
story
is
in
ourselves
that
ghosts
are
thus
and
so
the
spook
of
is
of
a
higher
nervous
organization
than
his
forbears
in
many
instances
the
ghost
is
so
distracted
by
circumstances
that
he
hardly
knows
where
he
at
as
for
instance
the
ghost
in
such
case
as
by
alice
brown
where
a
man
is
thought
to
be
drowned
and
his
ghost
comes
out
to
comfort
his
sweetheart
only
to
have
the
drowned
man
brought
back
to
life
presently
and
in
woman
from
by
stephen
french
whitman
where
a
scientist
with
impertinent
zeal
brings
life
back
to
the
body
of
a
woman
who
had
bled
to
death
while
hannibal
was
crossing
the
alps
and
been
buried
in
a
glacier
till
the
glacier
spat
her
out
now
what
was
the
status
of
those
ghosts
was
there
a
ghost
if
the
person
was
really
dead
but
if
a
woman
is
dead
after
she
has
been
in
an
for
two
thousand
years
or
thereabouts
what
surety
is
there
for
the
standing
of
any
ghost
the
apparitions
of
have
more
lines
of
interest
than
the
ancient
ghosts
the
gothic
specter
was
a
creature
with
a
brain
he
was
not
a
as
are
some
of
the
later
spooks
he
was
a
being
who
felt
a
call
to
haunt
somebody
for
some
purpose
or
other
so
he
just
went
and
did
it
the
specters
of
are
more
versatile
they
can
turn
their
hand
to
any
kind
of
haunting
that
is
desired
and
show
an
admirable
power
of
adaptability
though
there
are
highly
developed
specialists
as
well
the
psychology
of
the
primitive
ghost
and
of
the
gothic
specter
was
simple
they
knew
only
the
elemental
passions
of
love
and
hate
gothic
spooks
haunted
the
villain
or
villainess
to
foil
them
in
their
wicked
designs
or
punish
them
for
past
misdeeds
or
hovered
over
the
hero
or
heroine
to
advise
comfort
and
chaperon
them
but
the
modern
ghosts
are
not
satisfied
with
such
jobs
as
these
they
like
to
keep
in
the
van
of
activity
and
do
what
mortals
do
they
run
the
whole
scale
of
human
motions
and
emotions
and
one
needs
as
much
handy
psychology
to
interpret
their
hauntings
as
to
read
george
meredith
they
are
actuated
by
subtle
motivations
of
jealousy
ardent
love
tempered
friendship
curiosity
mischief
vindictiveness
revenge
hate
gratitude
and
all
other
conceivable
impulses
the
billy
sunday
sort
of
ghost
who
wants
to
convert
the
world
the
philanthropic
spirit
who
wants
to
help
humanity
the
socialist
specter
that
reads
the
magazine
the
friendly
visitor
that
sends
its
hands
back
to
wash
the
dishes
the
little
shepherd
lad
that
returns
to
tend
the
sheep
are
among
the
new
concepts
in
fiction
of
the
supernatural
the
ghost
of
awful
malice
to
be
explained
only
on
the
basis
of
compound
interest
of
evil
stored
up
for
many
years
is
a
new
force
though
the
ghostly
narrative
has
shifted
its
center
of
gravity
from
the
novel
to
the
short
story
since
gothic
times
and
many
more
of
the
modern
instances
are
in
that
form
the
supernatural
novel
has
recently
taken
on
a
new
lease
of
life
honors
are
almost
even
between
the
english
and
the
american
ghost
story
as
most
of
the
representative
writers
on
each
side
turn
their
pen
at
some
time
to
write
terror
tales
the
ghost
has
never
lost
his
power
over
the
human
mind
judging
from
the
past
one
may
say
that
the
popularity
of
the
ghost
story
will
continue
undiminished
and
will
perhaps
increase
certainly
there
has
been
a
new
influx
of
stories
within
later
times
what
mines
of
horror
yet
remain
untouched
for
writers
of
the
future
it
would
be
hard
to
say
yet
we
do
not
fear
for
the
exhaustion
of
the
type
on
the
contrary
ghosts
in
fiction
are
becoming
so
numerous
that
one
wonders
if
the
malthusian
theory
will
not
in
time
affect
them
we
are
too
fond
of
being
fooled
by
phantoms
to
surrender
them
for
the
slow
touch
of
a
frozen
finger
tracing
out
the
spine
is
an
awesome
joy
for
ourselves
we
are
content
for
the
present
to
function
on
one
plane
but
we
love
to
adventure
on
another
plane
through
spectral
substitutes
we
may
give
up
the
mortal
but
we
not
willingly
give
up
the
ghost
we
love
him
we
believe
in
him
our
attitude
towards
specters
is
much
like
that
of
the
little
black
boy
that
ellis
parker
butler
tells
about
in
ai

chapter
iv
the
devil
and
his
allies
ghosts
are
few
but
devils
are
plenty
said
cotton
mather
but
his
saying
would
need
to
be
inverted
to
fit
english
fiction
now
we
have
ghosts
in
abundance
but
devils
are
scarce
in
fact
they
bid
fair
to
become
extinct
in
our
romances
at
least
in
the
form
that
is
easily
recognizable
satan
will
probably
soon
be
in
solution
identified
merely
as
a
state
of
mind
he
has
been
so
burbanked
of
late
with
his
dæmonic
characteristics
removed
and
humanities
added
that
save
for
sporadic
reversion
to
type
the
old
familiar
demon
is
almost
a
vanished
form
the
modern
mind
seems
to
cling
with
a
new
fondness
to
the
ghost
but
has
turned
the
cold
shoulder
to
the
devil
perhaps
because
many
modernists
believe
more
in
the
human
and
less
in
the
supernatural
and
after
all
ghosts
are
human
and
devils
are
not
the
demon
has
disported
himself
in
various
forms
in
literature
from
the
scarlet
fiend
of
monkish
legend
the
nimble
imp
and
titanic
of
to
milton
epic
majestic
satan
and
goethe
mocking
mephistopheles
passing
into
allegoric
symbolic
and
satiric
figures
in
later
fiction
he
has
been
an
impressive
character
in
the
drama
the
epic
the
novel
in
poetry
and
the
short
story
we
have
seen
him
as
a
loathly
brutish
demon
in
dante
as
a
superman
as
an
intellectual
satirist
and
as
a
human
being
appealing
to
our
sympathy
he
has
gradually
lost
his
epic
qualities
and
become
human
he
is
not
present
in
literature
now
to
the
extent
to
which
he
was
known
in
the
past
is
not
so
impressive
a
figure
as
heretofore
and
at
times
when
he
does
appear
his
personality
is
so
ambiguously
set
forth
that
it
requires
close
literary
analysis
to
prove
his
presence
in
this
chapter
the
devil
will
be
discussed
with
reference
to
his
appearances
on
earth
while
in
a
later
division
he
will
be
seen
in
his
own
home
it
would
be
hard
to
say
with
certainty
when
and
where
the
devil
originated
yet
he
undoubtedly
belongs
to
one
of
our
first
families
and
is
said
to
have
been
born
theologically
in
persia
about
the
year
he
has
appeared
under
various
aliases
as
ahriman
of
the
zoroastrian
system
pluto
in
classical
mythology
satan
beelzebub
prince
of
darkness
and
by
many
other
titles
in
his
to
the
burns
invokes
him
thus
oh
thou
whatever
title
suit
thee
auld
hornie
satan
nick
or
cloutie
he
has
manifested
himself
in
fiction
under
diverse
names
as
demon
lucifer
satan
mephistopheles
prince
lucio
the
man
in
black
and
so
forth
but
whatever
the
name
he
answers
to
he
is
known
in
every
land
and
has
with
astonishing
adaptability
made
himself
at
home
in
every
literature
the
devil
has
so
changed
his
form
and
his
manner
of
appearance
in
later
literature
that
it
is
hard
to
identify
him
as
his
ancient
self
in
early
stories
he
was
heralded
by
supernatural
thunder
and
lightning
and
accompanied
by
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
he
dressed
in
character
costume
sometimes
in
red
sometimes
in
black
but
always
indubitably
diabolic
he
wore
horns
a
forked
tail
and
cloven
hoofs
and
was
a
generally
unprepossessing
creature
whom
anyone
could
know
for
a
devil
now
his
rôle
is
not
so
typical
and
his
garb
not
so
declarative
he
wears
an
evening
suit
a
scholar
gown
a
parson
robe
a
hunting
coat
with
equal
ease
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
tell
the
devil
from
the
hero
of
a
modern
story
he
has
been
deodorized
and
no
longer
reeks
warningly
of
the
pit
the
mediæval
mind
conceived
of
the
devil
as
a
sort
of
combination
of
mythologic
satyr
and
religious
dragon
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
pagan
have
been
engrafted
upon
the
ideas
of
christianity
to
fade
out
very
slowly
and
by
degrees
in
monkish
legends
the
devil
was
an
energetic
person
who
would
hang
round
a
likely
soul
for
years
if
need
be
on
the
chance
of
nabbing
him
many
monkish
legends
have
come
down
to
us
the
diabolic
element
in
english
shows
a
rich
field
for
study
the
devil
here
as
in
the
monkish
legendry
appears
as
an
enemy
of
souls
a
tireless
tempter
he
lies
in
wait
for
any
unwary
utterance
and
the
least
mention
of
his
name
any
thoughtless
expletive
such
as
the
devil
take
me
if
brings
instant
response
from
him
to
clinch
the
bargain
yet
the
devil
of
rustic
is
of
a
bucolic
dullness
less
clever
than
in
any
phase
of
literature
more
gullible
more
easily
imposed
on
english
especially
the
celtic
branches
shows
the
devil
as
very
closely
related
to
nature
he
was
wont
to
work
off
his
surplus
energy
or
his
wrath
by
disturbing
the
landscape
and
many
stories
of
his
prankish
pique
have
come
down
to
us
if
anything
vexed
him
he
might
stamp
so
hard
upon
a
plain
that
the
print
of
his
cloven
hoof
would
be
imprinted
permanently
he
was
fond
of
drinking
out
of
pure
springs
and
leaving
them
cursed
with
sulphur
and
he
sometimes
showed
annoyance
by
biting
a
section
out
of
a
mountain
devil
bit
mountain
in
ireland
being
one
of
the
instances
in
general
any
peculiarity
of
nature
might
be
attributed
to
the
activities
of
auld
hornie
the
devil
has
always
been
a
pushing
forward
sort
of
person
so
he
was
not
content
with
being
handed
round
by
word
of
mouth
in
monkish
legend
or
rustic
but
must
worm
his
way
into
literature
in
general
since
then
many
have
been
emptied
upon
him
besides
the
one
that
luther
hurled
against
his
cloister
wall
the
devil
is
seen
frequently
in
the
miracle
plays
showing
grotesquerie
the
beginnings
of
that
sardonic
humor
he
is
to
display
in
more
important
works
later
in
his
appearance
in
literature
the

is
largely
anthropomorphic
man
creates
the
devil
in
his
own
image
one
who
is
not
merely
personal
but
racial
as
well
reflecting
his
creator
in
monkish
tradition
an
adversary
in

in
rustic
a
rollicking
buffoon
with
waggish
pranks
in
miracle
plays
reflecting
the
mingled
seriousness
and
comic
elements
of
popular
beliefs
he
mirrors
his
maker
but
it
is
in
the
great
poems
and
dramas
and
stories
that
we
find
the
more
personal
aspects
of
and
it
is
these
epic
and
dramatic
concepts
of
the
devil
that
have
greatly
influenced
modern
fiction
while
the
gothic
romance
was
but
lightly
touched
by
the
epic
supernaturalism
the
literature
since
that
time
has
reflected
it
more
and
the
satanic
characters
of
dante
milton
calderon
marlowe
and
goethe
have
cast
long
shadows
over
modern
fiction
the
recent
revival
of
interest
in
dante
has
doubtless
had
its
effect
here
burns
in
his
to
the
shows
his
own
kindly
heart
and
honest
though
ofttimes
misdirected
impulses
by
suggesting
that
there
is
still
hope
for
the
devil
to
repent
and
trusting
that
he
may
do
so
yet
browning
in
her
of
likewise
shows
in
lucifer
some
appeal
to
our
sympathies
reflecting
the
pitying
heart
of
the
writer
showing
a
certain
kinship
to
milton
satan
yet
with
weakened
intellectual
power
she
makes
gabriel
say
to
him

such
as
thou
standest
pale
in
the
drear
light
which
rounds
the
rebel

thou

an
idea
to

down

cut
in
spanish
fashion
his
proud
face
was
strangely
pale
but
his
lips
were
like
a
proud
red
flower
he
seemed
weary
and
was
leaning
back
toying
in
a
listless
manner
with
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
when
the
fisherman
unthoughtedly
utters
a
prayer
that
baffles
the

for
the
time
the
demon
mounts
his
jennet
with

silver
harness
and
rides
away
still
with
the
proud
disdainful
face
sad
with
a
weariness

unscathed
in

marked
aspect
of
recent
is
the
tendency
to
gloze
over
his
sins
and
to
humanize
him
this
is
shown
to
a
marked
degree
in

anxious

maligned

her
characterization

some
reminiscence
of
a
hasty
reading
of
milton

and
the
byronic
cain
the
devil
has
a
human
as
well
as
dæmonic
spirit
in

in
where
he
appears
as
satan
maketrig
a
hunchback
with
gigantic
marble
brow
cold
keen
steely
eyes
and
handsome
lips
he
seems
a
normal
human
being
in
this
realistic
ghetto
setting
though
he
bears
a
nameless
sense
of
evil
about
with
him
in
his
presence
or
as
he
passes
by
all
the
latent
evil
in

souls
comes

he
lures
the
rabbi
away
from
his
wife
from

and
from
all
virtue
yet
to
see
him
at
the
end
turn
away
again
in
spirit
to
the
good
spurning
the
tempter
whom
he
recognizes
at
last
as
dæmonic
there
is
a
human
anguish
in
the
eyes
of
satan
maketrig
that
shows
him
to
be
not
altogether
diabolic
and
he
seems
mournful
and
appealing
in
his
wild
loneliness
his
nature
is
in
contrast
to
that
of
the
fiend
in
stanley
weyman
man
in
here
his
cold
sardonic
jesting
that
causes
him
to
play
with
life
and
death
so
lightly
his
diabolic
cunning
his
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
and
how
to
torture
it
remind
us
of
iago
the
dark
shade
extends
to
the
skin
as
well
as
to
the
heart
in
the
man
in

he
exercises
a
weird
power

his

dignity

with
superhuman
gigantism

into

thus
at
the

where
the
windows
seemed
to
have
disappeared
so
that
he
could
see
the
stars
there
rose
up
into
view
far
against
the
sky
grand
and
terrible
the
outline
of
a
man
a
kind
of
gray
glory
enveloped
him
so
that
it
resembled
a
statue
immense
imposing
horrific
in
its
distant
splendor
the
gray
radiance
from
its
mightily
broken
visage
august
and
mournful
beat
down
upon
his
soul
pulsing
like
some
dark
star
with
the
powers
of
spiritual
evil
here
as
in
many
instances
elsewhere
the
sadness
of
the
diabolic
character
is
emphasized
a
definite
human
element
the
miltonic
influence
seems
evident
in
such
cases
kipling
has
a
curious
dæmonic
study
in
well
a
story
of
a
patch
of
ground
filled
with
devils
and
ghosts
controlled
by
an
native
priest
while
in
the
imps
terrorize
young
army
officers
by
their
malicious
mischief
the
allegorical
and
symbolic
studies
of
diabolism
are
among
the
more
impressive
creations
in
later
fiction
as
in
tolstoi
the
where
the
demons
are
responsible
for
the
marshaling
of
armies
the
tyranny
of
money
and
the
inverted
ideas
of
the
value
of
service
the
appearance
of
the
devil
in
later
stories
is
more
terrible
and
effective
in
its
variance
of
type
and
its
secret
symbolism
than
the
crude
enginery
of
diabolism
in
gothic
fiction
as
the
muscular
fiend
that
athletically
hurls
the
man
and
woman
from
the
mountain
top
or
the
invisible
physical
strength
manifested
in
the
the
crude
violence
of
these
novels
is
in
keeping
with
the
fiction
of
the
time
yet
modern
stories
show
a
distinct
advance
as
such
instances
as
shorthouse
where
the
devil
appears
differently
to
each
tempted
soul
embodying
with
hideous
wisdom
the
form
of
the
sin
that
that
particular
soul
is
most
liable
to
commit
he
bears
the
shape
of
committed
sin
suggesting
that
evil
is
so
powerful
as
to
have
an
independent
existence
of
its
own
apart
from
the
mind
that
gave
it
birth
as
the
devil
appears
as
evil
thought
materialized
in
fernac
molnar
drama
fiona
strange
gaelic
tale
introduces
demons
symbolically
the
is
a
person
that
by
an
ancient
formula
can
remove
the
sins
from
an
unburied
corpse
and
let
them
in
turn
be
swept
away
from
him
by
the
action
of
the
pure
air
but
if
the
hates
the
dead
man
he
has
the
power
to
fling
the
transgressions
into
the
sea
to
turn
them
into
demons
that
pursue
and
torment
the
flying
soul
till
judgment
day
in
or
one
aspect
of
the
recent
stories
of
diabolism
is
the
subtleness
by
which
the
evil
is
suggested
the
reader
feels
a
miasmatic
atmosphere
of
evil
a
smear
on
the
soul
and
knows
that
certain
incidents
in
the
action
can
be
accounted
for
on
no
other
basis
than
that
of
dæmonic
presence
as
in
barry
pain
where
the
princess
is
moved
by
a
strange
irresistible
lure
to
dance
alone
night
after
night
in
the
heart
of
the
secret
labyrinth
to
mystic
music
that
the
white
moon
makes
but
one
night
after
she
is
dizzy
and
exhausted
but
impelled
to
keep
on
she
feels
a
hot
hand
grasp
hers
someone
whirls
her
madly
round
and
she
knows
that
is
not
dancing
she
is
seen
no
more
of
men
and
searchers
find
only
the
prints
of
her
little
dancing
slippers
in
the
sand
with
the
mark
of
a
cloven
hoof
beside
them
the
most
revolting
instances
of
suggestive
diabolism
are
found
in
arthur
machen
stories
where
supernatural
science
opens
the
way
for
the
devil
to
enter
the
human
soul
since
the
biologist
by
a
cunning
operation
on
the
brain
removes
the
moral
sense
takes
away
the
soul
and
leaves
a
being
absolutely
diabolized
worse
still
is
the
hideousness
of
the
great
god
where
the
dæmonic
character
is
a
composite
of
the
loathsome
aspects
of
pan
and
the
devil
from
which
horrible
paternity
is
born
a
child
that
embodies
all
the
unspeakable
evil
in
the
world
in
pleasant
contrast
to
dreadful
stories
are
the
tales
of
the
amusing
devils
that
we
find
frequently
the
comic
devil
is
much
older
than
the
comic
ghost
as
authors
showed
a
levity
toward
demons
long
before
they
treated
the
specter
with
disrespect
one
rather
wonders
why
clownish
devils
that
appeared
in
the
miracle
plays
prepared
the
way
for
the
humorous
and
satiric
treatment
of
the
elizabethan
drama
and
late
fiction
the
liturgical
imps
were
usually
funny
whether
their
authors
intended
them
as
such
or
not
but
the
devils
in
fiction
are
quite
conscious
of
their
own
wit
in
fact
are
rather
conceited
about
it
poe
shows
us
several
amusing
demons
who
display
his
curious
satiric
humor
for
instance
the
old
gentleman
in
bet
the
devil
your
when
toby
dammit
makes
his
rash
assertion
he
beholds
the
figure
of
a
little
lame
old
gentleman
of
venerable
aspect
nothing
could
be
more
reverend
than
his
whole
appearance
for
he
not
only
had
on
a
full
suit
of
black
but
his
shirt
was
perfectly
clean
and
the
collar
turned
down
very
neatly
over
a
white
cravat
while
his
hair
was
parted
in
front
like
a
girl
his
hands
were
clasped
pensively
over
his
stomach
and
his
two
eyes
were
carefully
rolled
up
into
the
top
of
his
head
this
clerical
personage
who
reminds
us
of
the
devil
in
who
also
appears
as
a
parson
claims
the
better
head
and
neatly
carries
it
off
this
is
a
modern
version
of
an
incident
similar
to
where
the
devil
claimed
whatever
was
offered
him
in
sincerity
the
combination
of
humor
and
mystery
in
washington
devil
and
tom
shows
the
black
woodsman
in
an
amusing
though
terrifying
aspect
as
he
claims
the
keeping
of
the
contracts
made
with
him
by
tom
and
his
miserly
wife
when
tom
goes
to
search
for
his
spouse
in
the
woods
he
fails
to
find
her
she
had
probably
attempted
to
deal
with
the
black
man
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
deal
with
her
husband
but
though
the
female
scold
is
generally
considered
a
match
for
the
devil
yet
in
this
instance
she
appears
to
have
had
the
worst
of
it
she
must
have
died
game
however
for
it
is
said
tom
noticed
many
prints
of
cloven
feet
deeply
stamped
about
the
tree
and
found
handsful
of
hair
that
looked
as
if
they
had
been
plucked
from
the
coarse
shock
of
the
black
woodsman
tom
knew
his
wife
prowess
by
experience
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
looked
at
the
fierce
signs
of
egad
he
said
to
himself
old
scratch
must
have
had
a
tough
time
of
it
the
devil
amuses
himself
in
various
ways
as
is
seen
by
the
antics
of
the
mysterious
stranger
in
poe
devil
in
the
who
comes
curvetting
into
the
old
dutch
village
with
his
audacious
and
sinister
face
and
curious
costume
to
upset
the
sacred
time
of
the
place
the
visitant
in
is
likewise
queer
as
to
dress
and
habits
he
wears
garments
in
the
style
of
a
century
before
having
a
queue
but
no
shirt
a
cravat
with
an
ecclesiastic
suggestion
also
a
stylus
and
black
book
his
facial
expression
is
such
as
would
have
struck
uriah
heap
dumb
with
envy
and
the
hint
of
hoofs
and
a
forked
tail
is
cleverly
given
though
not
obtruded
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
his
appearance
however
is
that
he
has
no
eyes
simply
a
dead
level
of
flesh
he
declares
that
he
eats
souls
and
prefers
to
buy
them
alive
to
insure
freshness
he
has
a
taste
for
philosophers
when
they
are
not
too
tough
the
satiric
devil
like
the
satiric
ghost
is
seen
in
modern
fiction
eugene
field
has
a
story
of
a
demon
who
seems
sympathetic
weeping
large
gummy
tears
at
hearing
a
mortal
woes
and
signing
the
conventional
contract
on
a
piece
of
asbestos
paper
he
agrees
to
do
everything
the
man
wishes
for
a
certain
term
of
years
in
return
for
which
he
is
to
get
the
soul
if
the
devil
forfeits
the
contract
he
loses
not
only
that
victim
but
the
souls
of
two
thousand
already
in
his
clutches
the
man
shrewdly
demands
trying
things
of
him
but
the
demon
is
game
building
and
endowing
churches
carrying
on
philanthropic
and
reform
work
without
complaint
but
balking
when
the
man
asks
him
to
close
the
saloons
on
sunday
rather
than
do
that
he
releases
the
two
thousand
and
one
souls
and
flies
away
twitching
his
tail
in
wrath
and
the
the
most
recent
as
perhaps
the
most
striking
instance
of
the
satiric
devil
is
in
mark
twain
posthumous
novel
mysterious
a
youth
charming
courtly
and
handsome
appears
in
a
medieval
village
confessing
to
two
boys
that
he
is
satan
though
not
the
original
of
that
name
but
his
nephew
and
namesake
he
insists
that
he
is
an
unfallen
angel
since
his
uncle
is
the
only
member
of
his
family
that
has
sinned
satan
reads
the
thoughts
of
mortals
kindles
fire
in
his
pipe
by
breathing
on
it
supplies
money
and
other
desirable
things
by
mere
suggestion
is
invisible
when
he
wills
it
so
and
is
generally
a
gifted
being
this
perennial
boy
only
sixteen
thousand
years
old
makes
a
charming
companion
he
says
to
marget
that
his
papa
is
in
shattered
health
and
has
no
property
to
speak
of
in
fact
none
of
any
earthly
value
but
he
has
an
uncle
in
business
down
in
the
tropics
who
is
very
well
off
and
has
a
monopoly
and
it
is
from
this
uncle
that
he
drew
his
support
marget
expresses
the
hope
that
her
uncle
and
his
would
meet
some
day
and
satan
says
he
hoped
so
too
may
be
they
will
says
marget
does
your
uncle
travel
much
oh
yes
he
goes
all
about
he
has
business
everywhere
the
book
is
full
of
this
oblique
humor
satirizing
earth
heaven
and
hell
the
stranger
by
his
comments
on
theological
creeds
satirizes
religion
and
satan
is
an
intended
parody
of
god
he
sneers
at
mongrel
moral
sense
which
tells
him
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
insisting
that
he
should
have
no
choice
that
the
right
to
choose
makes
him
inevitably
choose
the
wrong
he
makes
little
figures
out
of
clay
and
gives
them
life
only
to
destroy
them
with
casual
ruthlessness
a
little
later
and
send
them
to
hell
in
answer
to
the
old
faith
in
god
when
she
says
that
he
will
care
for
her
and
her
mistress
since
not
a
sparrow
falleth
to
the
ground
without
his
knowledge
he
sneers
but
it
falls
just
the
same
what
the
good
of
seeing
it
fall
he
is
a
new
diabolic
figure
yet
showing
the
composite
traits
of
the
old
the
dæmonic
wisdom
and
sarcasm
the
superhuman
magnetism
to
draw
men
to
him
and
the
human
qualities
of
geniality
sympathy
and
boyish
charm
one
of
the
most
significant
and
frequent
motifs
of
the
diabolic
in
literature
is
that
of
the
barter
of
the
human
soul
for
the
gift
of
some
earthly
boon
long
life
or
wealth
or
power
or
wisdom
or
gratification
of
the
senses
it
is
a
theme
of
unusual
power
what
could
be
greater
than
the
struggle
over
one
own
immortal
soul
and
well
might
the
great
minds
of
the
world
engage
themselves
with
it
yet
that
theme
is
but
little
apparent
in
later
stories
we
have
no
such
character
in
recent
literature
that
can
compare
with
faustus
or
goethe
mephistopheles
or
calderon
magician
hawthorne
septimius
felton
makes
a
bargain
with
the
devil
to
secure
the
elixir
of
life
there
is
a
legend
in
hardy
of
the
d
of
a
man
that
sold
himself
to
the
minister
of
evil
and
the
incident
occurs
in
various
stories
of
witchcraft
yet
with
waning
power
and
less
frequence
the
most
significant
recent
use
of
it
is
in
yeats
drama
this
is
a
drama
of
ireland
where
the
peasants
have
been
driven
by
famine
to
barter
their
souls
to
the
devil
to
buy
their
children
food
but
their
countess
sells
her
own
soul
to
the
demon
that
they
may
save
theirs
this
vicarious
sacrifice
adds
a
new
poignancy
to
the
situation
and
yeats
has
treated
it
with
power
this
is
the
only
recent
appearance
of
the
devil
on
the
stage
for
he
has
practically
disappeared
from
english
drama
where
he
was
once
so
prominent
the
demon
was
a
familiar
and
leading
figure
on
the
miracle
and
elizabethan
stage
but
like
the
ghost
he
shows
more
vitality
now
in
fiction
the
devil
is
an
older
figure
in
english
drama
than
is
the
ghost
but
he
seems
to
have
played
out
the
analysis
and
representation
of
the
devil
as
a
character
in
literature
have
covered
a
great
range
from
the
bestiality
of
demon
in
the
to
milton
mighty
angel
in
ruins
with
all
sorts
of
variations
between
from
the
sneering
cynicism
of
mephisto
to
the
pinchbeck
diabolism
of
marie
corelli
sorrowful
satan
and
the
merry
humor
and
blasphemous
satire
of
mark
twain
mysterious
stranger
we
note
an
especial
influence
of
goethe
mephistopheles
in
the
satiric
studies
of
the
demon
an
echo
of
his
diabolic
climax
when
in
answer
to
faust
outcry
over
margaret
downfall
and
death
he
says
is
not
the
one
hears
echoing

all
literature

are
sounded
again
and
again
the
great
diabolic
figures
in
their
essential
humanity
their
intellectual
dignity
their
sad
introspection
their
pitiless
testing
of
the
human
soul
to
its
predestined

are
terrible
allegorical
images
of
the
evil
in
man

or
concepts
of
social
sins
as
in
the
the
devils
of
the
great
writers
reflecting
the
time
the
racial
characteristics
the
personal
natures
of
their
creators
are
deeply
symbolic
each
man
creates
the
devil
that
he
can
understand
that
represents
him
for
as
amiel
says
we
can
comprehend
nothing
of
which
we
have
not
the
beginnings
in
ourselves
as
each
man
sees
a
different
hamlet
so
each
one
has
his
own
devil
or
his
own
devil
this
is
illustrated
by
the
figure
in
julian
hawthorne
in
where
the
dead
man
spirit
meets
the
devil
in
the
after
life
who
is
his
own
image
his
dæmonic
double
some
have
one
great
fiend
while
others
keep
packs
of
little
snarling
imps
of
darkness
a
study
of
comparative
diabolics
is
illuminating

be
useful

us

and
a
portion
of
his
dark
mantle
falls
upon
them
the
sorcerer
and
the
witch
are
ancient
figures
in
literature
and
like
others
of
the
supernatural
kingdom
notably
the
devil
they
have
their
origin
in
the
east
the
cuneiform

of
the
chaldeans
showing
belief
in
witchcraft
and
the
witch
of
endor
summoning
the
spirit
of
samuel
to
confront
saul
is
a
very
real
figure
in
the
old
testament
the
greeks
believed
in
witches
as
did
the
romans
meroe
a
witch
is
described
in
the
of
lucius
appuleius
from
whom
perhaps
the
witch
meroe
in
peele
wives
gets
her
name
and
character
in
classical
times
witches
were
thought
to
have
power
to
turn
men
into
beasts
tigers
monkeys
or
asses
some
persons
still
believe
that
women
have
that
power
and
might
give
authenticated
instances
the
sorcerer
or
wizard
or
warlock
or
magician
as
he
is
variously
called
was
a
more
common
figure
in
early
literature
than
in
later
perhaps
because
as
in
so
many
other
cases
his
profession
has
suffered
a
feminine
invasion
the
word
meaning
witch
is
masculine
which
may
or
may
not
mean
that
witchcraft
was
a
manly
art
in
those
days
and
the
most
famous
medieval
enchanter
merlin
was
a
man
it
should
be
noted
the
sorcerer
of
primitive
times
has
been
gradually
reduced
in
power
changing
through
the
astrologer
and
alchemist
of
medieval
and
gothic
romance
into
the
bacteriologist
and
biologist
of
recent
fiction
where
he
works
other
wonders
in
general
warlocks
and
wizards
while
frequent
enough
in
early
literature
and
in

have
become

numerous

had
disappeared
and
before
he
was
aware
it
had
entered

this
is
a
parallel
to
the
cases
of
ghostly
doubles
discussed
in

chapter
the
magician
shows
a
disposition
to
adapt
himself
to
contemporary
conditions
and
to
change
his
personality
with
the
times
not
so
the
witch
she
is
a
permanent
figure
she
has
appeared
in
the
various
forms
of
literature
in
elizabethan
drama
in
gothic
romance
in
modern
poetry
the
novel
and
the
short
story
and
is
very
much
alive
we
have
witches
young
and
old
we
have
the
fake
witch
like
the
hoax
ghost
the
imputed
witch
and
the
genuine
article
we
have
witch
stories
melodramatic
romantic
tragic
comic
and
satiric
showing
the
influence
of
the
great
creations
of
past
literature
with
modern
adaptations
and
additions
english
poetry
is
full
of
witchery
perhaps
largely
the
result
of
the
celtic
influence
on
our
literature
the
poetic
type
of
witchcraft
is
brought
out
in
such
poems
as
where
the
beauty
and
suggestiveness
veil
the
sense
of
unearthly
evil
or
in
shelley
of
where
the
woman
appears
as
a
symbol
of
alluring
loveliness
possessing
none
of
the
hideous
aspects
seen
in
other
weird
women
the
water
enchantress
in
shelley
fragment
of
an
unfinished
drama
might
be
mentioned
as
another
example
while
keats
belle
dame
sans
has
a
magical
charm
all
her
own
christina
rossetti
shows
a
peculiar
aspect
of
magic
as
also
browning

of
the
brown
on
the
contrary
milton
robert
herrick
and
james
hogg
witch
of
illustrate
the
uglier
aspects
of
enchantment
there
are
two
definite
types
of
witches
seen
in
english
fiction
the
first
being
merely
the
reputed
witch
the
woman
who
is
falsely
accused
or
suspected
of
black
arts
and
who
either
is
persecuted
or
else
gains
what
she
wishes
by
hints
of
her
traffic
in
evil
like
the
old
granny
young
in
host
and
the
by
james
blythe
who
chants
as
a
a
curse
shall
lay
on
water
and
land
for
the
thing
denied
the
witch
hand
so
that
everybody
is
afraid
to
refuse
her
whatever
she
demands
this
is
a
highly
conventionalized
type
of
the
motif
and
though
it
is
found
in
great
numbers
in
modern
fiction
is
not
particularly
important
the
principal
complications
of
the
plot
are
usually
the
same
the
character
known
as
the
witch
being
either
an
appealing
figure
winning
sympathy
because
of
her
beauty
and
youth
or
else
touching
to
pity
because
of
her
age
and
infirmities
no
person
of
average
age
or
pulchritude
is
ever
accused
of
witchcraft
in
english
fiction
she
is
always
very
old
and
poor
or
young
and
lovely
item
also
she
invariably
has
two
lovers
in
the
latter
case
she
is
merely
a
romantic
peg
on
which
to
hang
a
story
not
always
real
as
a
human
being
and
not
a
real
witch
in
these
stories
the
only
magic
used
is
love
the
fair
maid
having
unintentionally
charmed
the
heart
of
a
villain
who
failing
to
win
her
accuses
her
of
witchcraft
in
order
to
frighten
her
into
love
in
some
of
the
novels
and
stories
the
victim
is
actually
executed
while
in
others
she
is
rescued
by
her
noble
lover
at
the
second
we
have
the
pursuing
villain
the
distressed
innocence
the
chivalric
lover
disporting
themselves
in
late
gothic
fashion
over
many
romances
even
mary
johnston
with
her
knowledge
of
colonial
times
and
her
power
to
give
atmosphere
to
the
past
does
not
succeed
in
imparting
the
breath
of
life
to
her
late
novel
of
witchcraft
these
beauties
who
speak
in
euphuistic
sentences
who
show
a
lamblike
defiance
toward
the
dark
tempters
who
breathe
prayers
to
heaven
for
protection
and
forgiveness
to
their
enemies
in
one
breath
who
die
or
are
rescued
with
equal
grace
and
propriety
one
is
carried
away
from
the
scaffold
by
kidd
the
pirate
thus
delaying
for
several
chapters
her
rescue
by
her
faithful
lover
do
not
really
touch
the
heart
any
more
than
they
interest
the
intellect
yet
there
are
occasional
instances
of
the
imputed
witch
who
seems
real
despite
her
handicap
of
beauty
and
youth
as
iseult
le
desireuse
in
maurice
hewlett
whom
prosper
le
gai
weds
to
save
from
the
hangman
the
young
woman
in
marion
of
might
be
called
a
problematic
witch
for
while
she
does
undoubtedly
work
magic
it
is
for
the
most
part
attributed
to
her
powers
of
hypnotism
rather
than
to
the
black
art
itself
we
find
an
excellent
example
of
the
reputed
witch
who
is
a
woman
of
real
charm
and
individuality
in
daughter
of
where
the
young
girl
is
beset
by
cruel
dangers
because
of
her
charm
and
her
lonely
condition
and
who
rises
to
tragic
heights
of
sacrifice
to
save
her
lover
from
death
choosing
to
be
burned
to
death
as
a
witch
to
save
him
from
paying
the
penalty
of
murder
she
actually
convinces
him
as
well
as
the
others
that
she
has
bewitched
him
by
unholy
powers
that
she
has
slain
his
father
and
made
him
believe
that
he
himself
did
it
to
save
her
honor
and
she
goes
to
her
death
with
a
white
fervor
of
courage
with
no
word
of
complaint
save
one
gentle
rebuke
to
him
that
should
not
revile
her
the
aged
is
in
the
main
more
appealing
than
the
young
one
because
more
realistic
yet
there
is
no
modern
instance
that
is
so
touching
as
the
poor
old
crone
in
witch
of
who
is
persecuted
for
being
a
witch
and
who
turns
upon
her
tormentors
with
a
speech
that
reminds
us
of
shylock
famous
outcry
showing
clearly
how
their
suspicion
and
accusation
have
made
her
what
she
is
we
see
here
a
witch
in
the
making
an
innocent

who
is
harried
by

beings
till
she
makes
a

a

sibylline

individual

yet
with
more
than
a
suggestion
of
superhuman

and
power
scott

frequently

conveys
a
genuine

her
attributes
have
been
less
conventionalized
than
those
of
her
youthful
companions
who
are
merely
under
the
imputation
of
black
art
and
she
possesses
a
diabolic
individuality
though
she
may
not
remain
long
in

she
is
an
impressive

of
instances

to
cast
a

over

causing
him
to
leave
his

and
wed
the

when
understanding
comes
to
him
and
with

loathing
the

seeks
to
regain
his

by
following
the
counsel
of
an
old
magician

her
an
image
to
be
burnt
but
that
burning
of
the
image
kills
her
and
looses
the
man
from

spell
that
incident
is
similar
to
that
in
tramonto
where
the
dogaressa
seeks
to
slay
her
rival
both
probably
being
based
on
the
unforgettable
employment
of

on
as
they
foretell
the
young
and
beautiful
witch

work
as
much
evil
as
the
ancient
crone
perhaps
more
since
her
emotions
are
wilder
and
more
unrestrained
she
can
project
a
curse
that
reaches
its
victim
across
the
ocean
when
the
one
who
sent
the
curse

rotting
in

the

shown
here
and

an
illustration
of
the
human
nature
of
the

like

makes
a
strong
appeal
to
our
sympathy
in
spite
of
the
undoubted
iniquity
in

his

of
symbolism
enters
largely
into

at

by

a
heritage
of
subliminal
memory
become
witches
horrible
unhuman
that
dance
the
blasphemous
dance
of
the

the
story
symbolizes
the
eternal
curse
that
rests
upon
evil
the
undying
quality
of
thought
and
action
that
can
not
cease
when
the
body
of
the
sinner
has
become
dust
but
reaches
out
into
endless
generations
in
fires
and
profitable
by
we
see
a
witch
a
young
woman
whose
soul
is
under
a
spell
from
the
devil
she
gives
rich
gifts
to
the
church
but
her
offerings
turn
into
toads
and
vipers
defiling
the
sanctuary
and
as
she
sings
her
wild
songs
the
bodies
of
drowned
men
come
floating
to
the
surface
of
the
water
and
join
in
the
words
of
her
song
her
beauty
is
supernatural
and
accursed
yet
her
soul
is
innocent
of
wish
to
do
evil
though
it
leaves
her
body
and
goes
like
a
cresseted
flame
at
night
to
follow
the
devil
while
the
body
is
powerless
in
sleep
finally
the
devil
comes
in
the
form
of
a
moor
possibly
a
suggestion
from
and
summons
her
when
she
dies
with
a
crucifix
clasped
over
her
heart
yeats
has
pictured
several
witches
for
us
as
the
crone
of
the
gray
hawk
in
wisdom
of
the
a
woman
tall
with
more
than
mortal
height
with
feathers
of
the
gray
hawk
growing
in
her
hair
who
stoops
over
the
royal
cradle
and
whispers
a
strange
thing
to
the
child
as
a
result
of
which
he
grows
up
in
a
solitude
of
his
own
mystic
thoughts
with
dreams
that
are
like
the
marching
and
of
armies
when
he
realizes
that
the
simple
joys
of
life
and
love
are
not
for
him
he
disappears
some
say
to
make
his
home
with
the
immortal
demons
some
say
with
the
shadowy
goddesses
that
haunt
the
midnight
pools
in
the
forest
in
curse
of
the
fires
and
the
yeats
pictures
another
witch
tall
and
in
a
gray
gown
who
is
standing
in
the
river
and
washing
washing
the
dead
body
of
a
man
as
the
troopers
who
have
murdered
the
friars
and
burned
down
the
church
ride
past
each
man
recognizes
in
the
dead
face
his
own
face
just
a
moment
before
they
all
plunge
over
the
abyss
to
death
there
are
witches
in
most
collections
of
english
for
the
simpler
people
the
more
elemental
natures
have
a
strong
feeling
for
the
twilight
of
nature
and
of
life
the
weird
woman
has
power
over
the
forces
of
nature
and
can
evoke
the
wrath
of
the
elements
as
of
unholy
powers
against
her
enemies
stories
of
witches
as
of
sorcerers
occur
in
indian
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
american
indian
differing
in
details
in
the
tribal
collections
yet
showing
similar
essential
ideas
the
scotch
show
special
predilection
for
the
witch
since
with
their
tense
stern
natures
they
stand
in
awe
of
the
darker
powers
and
of
those
that
call
them
forth
they
relate
curious
instances
of
the
relations
between
the
animal
world
and
witchcraft
as
in
dark
nameless
by
fiona
mcleod
the
story
of
a
nun
that
falls
in
love
with
a
seal
and
is
forced
to
live
forever
in
the
sea
weaving
her
spells
where
the
white
foam
froths
and
knowing
that
her
soul
is
lost
this
is
akin
to
the
theme
that
matthew
arnold
uses
though
with
a
different
treatment
showing
similarity
to
hans
christian
tale
of
little
the
cailleachuisge
or
the
and
the
maighdeanmhara
the
mermaid
and
the
kelpie
the
are
cursed
with
dæmonic
spells
and
live
forever
in
their
witchery
when
mortals
forsake
the
earth
and
follow
them
their
children
are
beings
that
have
no
souls
the
irish
on
the
other
hand
while
having
their
quota
of
witches
do
not
think
so
much
about
them
or
take
them
quite
so
seriously
inclining
more
to
the
faëry
forms
of
supernaturalism
suited
to
their
poetic
natures
the
sense
of
beauty
of
the
irish
is
so
vivid
and
their
innate
poetry
so
intense
that
they
glimpse
the
loveliness
of
magic
and
their
enchanted
beings
are
of
beauty
rather
than
of
horror
in
his
and
we
even
have
the
humorous
and
satiric
witch
to
correspond
to
similar
representations
of
the
ghost
and
the
devil
in
modern
fiction
the
instance
in
burns
needs
only
to
be
recalled
with
the
ludicrous
description
of
the
wild
race
at
night
to
escape
the
dread
powers
sanders
and
by
edgar
wallace
introduces
a
witch
with
comic
qualities
a
woman
whose
husband
has
been
a
magician
and
the
reputed
familiar
of
a
devil
she
cures
people
by
laying
her
hands
on
them
once
causing
a
bone
that
was
choking
a
child
to
fly
out
with
a
cry
terrible
to
hear
such
a
cry
as
a
leopard
makes
when
pursued
by
ghosts
when
this
witch
with
a
sense
of
humor
is
arrested
as
a
by
an
army
officer
she
eradicates
her
clothes
causing
very
comic
complications
the
best
example
of
the
satiric
witch
is
hawthorne
mother
rigby
in
who
constructs
a
man
from
a
broomstick
and
other
materials
for
a
scarecrow
in
this
satiric
sermon
upon
the
shams
and
hypocrisies
of
life
mother
rigby
with
her
sardonic
humor
her
cynical
comments
parodies
society
holds
the
mirror
up
to
human
life
and
shows
more
than
one
poor
painted
scarecrow
simulacrum
of
humanity
masquerading
as
a
man
the
figure
that
she
creates
with
his
yearnings
and
his
pride
his
horror
when
he
realizes
his
own
falsity
and
emptiness
is
more
human
more
a
man
than
many
a
being
we
meet
in
literature
or
in
life
barry
pain
has
several
witch
stories
that
do
not
fall
readily
into
any
category
curious
stories
of
scientific
in
the
realm
of
the
unreal
is
the
account
of
a
supernatural
woman
whether
a
witch
or
one
of
the
fates
one
does
not
know
who
comes
clad
in
scarlet
rags
to
show
human
souls
their
destinies
she
permits
an
exchange
of
fate
if
one
is
willing
to
pay
her
price
which
is
in
each
case
terrible
enough
one
young
girl
gives
up
her
pictured
future
of
life
and
love
and
surrenders
her
mind
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
baby
brother
from
his
destined
fate
of
suicide
in
manhood
the
crone
appears
to
an
old
man
that
loves
the
child
who
takes
upon
himself
her
fate
of
being
turned
into
a
bird
to
be
tortured
after
human
death
so
that
the
young
girl
may
have
his
future
to
be
turned
into
a
white
lamb
that
dies
after
an
hour
then
be
a
soul
set
free
glass
of
supreme
is
another
story
of
prophetic
witchery
of
revealed
fate
seen
in
supernatural
dreams
a
young
man
in
his
college
study
sees
the
fireplace
turn
into
a
silver
stairway
down
which
a
lovely
woman
comes
to
him
she
shows
him
a
mirror
the
glass
of
supreme
moments
in
which
the
highest
instants
of
each
man
life
are
shown
she
says
of
it
all
the
ecstasy
of
the
world
lies
there
the
supreme
moments
of
each
man
life
the
scene
the
spoken
words
all
lie
there
past
and
present
and
future
all
are
there
she
shows
an
emotion
meter
that
measures
the
thrill
of
joy
after
he
has
seen
the
climactic
instants
of
his
friends
lives
he
asks
to
see
his
own
when
she
tells
him
his
are
here
and
now
she
tells
him
that
her
name
is
death
and
that
he
will
die
if
he
kisses
her
but
he
cries
out
i
will
die
kissing
you
and
presently
his
mates
return
to
find
his
body
fallen
dead
across
his
table
there
is
something
infinitely
appealing
about
the
character
of
the
witch
she
seems
a
creature
of
tragic
loneliness
conscious
of
her
own
dark
powers
yet
conscious
also
of
her
exile
from
the
good
and
knowing
that
all
the
evil
she
evokes
will
somehow
come
back
to
her
that
her
curses
will
come
home
as
in
the
case
of
where
the
witch
by
making
a
cake
of
hair
to
overcome
her
rival
in
love
brings
on
a
tempest
that
kills
her
lover
and
drives
her
mad
each
evil
act
each
dark
imagining
seems
to
create
a
demon
and
turn
him
loose
to
harry
humanity
with
unceasing
force
as
matthew
maule
curse
in
house
of
seven
casts
a
spiritual
shadow
on
the
home
yet
the
witch
is
sometimes
a
minister
of
good
as
mephistopheles
says
of
himself
achieving
the
good
where
he
meant
evil
sometimes
typifying
the
mysterious
mother
nature
as
the
old
wittikin
in
neither
good
nor
evil
neither
altogether
human
nor
supernatural
her
strange
symbolism
is
always
impressive
spirits
closely
related
to
the
devil
are
certain
diabolic
spirits
that
are
given
supernatural
power
by
him
and
acknowledge
his
suzerainty
these
include
ghouls
vampires
werewolves
and
other
demoniac
animals
as
well
as
the
human
beings
that
through
a
compact
with
the
fiend
share
in
his
dark
force
since
such
creatures
possess
dramatic
possibilities
they
have
given
interest
to
fiction
and
other
literature
from
early
times
this
idea
of
an
unholy
alliance
between
earth
and
hell
has
fascinated
the
human
mind
and
been
reflected
astonishingly
in
literature
in
studying
the
appearance
of
these
beings
in
english
fiction
we
note
as
in
the
case
of
the
ghost
the
witch
and
the
devil
a
certain
leveling
influence
a
tendency
to
humanize
them
and
give
them
characteristics
that
appeal
to
our
sympathy
the
vampire
and
the
ghoul
are
closely
related
and
by
some
authorities
are
considered
the
same
yet
there
is
a
distinction
the
ghoul
is
a
being
to
quote
poe
neither
man
nor
woman
neither
brute
nor
human
that
feeds
upon
corpses
stealing
out
at
midnight
for
loathsome
banquets
in
graveyards
he
devours
the
flesh
of
the
dead
while
the
vampire
drains
the
blood
of
the
living
the
ghoul
is
an
asiatic
creature
and
has
left
but
slight
impress
upon
english
literature
while
the
vampire
has
been
a
definite
motif
the
vampire
superstition
goes
back
to
ancient
times
being
referred
to
on
chaldean
and
assyrian
tablets
william
of
newbury
of
the
twelfth
century
in
england
relates
several
stories
of
them
one
vampire
was
burned
in
melrose
abbey
and
tourists
in
ireland
are
still
shown
the
grave
of
a
vampire
perhaps
the
vampire
superstition
goes
back
to
the
savagery
of
remote
times
and
is
an
animistic
survival
of
human
sacrifices
of
cannibalism
and
the
like
the
vampire
is
thought
of
as
an
evil
spirit
issuing
forth
at
night
to
attack
the
living
in
their
sleep
and
drain
the
blood
which
is
necessary
to
prolong
its
own
revolting
existence
certain
persons
were
thought
to
be
especially
liable
to
become
vampires
at
death
such
as
suicides
witches
wizards
persons
who
in
life
had
been
attacked
by
vampires
outcasts
of
various
kinds
as
well
as
certain
animals
werewolves
dead
lizards
and
others
the
vampire
superstition
was
general
in
the
east
and
extended
to
europe
it
is
thought
by
way
of
greece
the
greeks
thought
of
the
vampire
as
a
beautiful
young
woman
a
lamia
who
lured
young
men
to
their
death
the
belief
was
particularly
strong
in
central
europe
but
never
seemed
to
gain
the
same
foothold
in
england
that
it
did
on
the
continent
though
it
is
evident
here
and
has
influenced
literature
the
vampire
has
been
the
inspiration
for
several
operas
and
has
figured
in
the
drama
in
poetry
in
the
novel
and
short
story
as
well
as
in
and
medieval
legends
the
stories
show
the
various
aspects
of
the
belief
and
its
ancient
hold
on
the
popular
mind
the
vampire
as
well
as
the
ghost
the
devil
and
the
witch
has
appeared
on
the
english
stage
an
anonymous
melodrama
in
two
acts
a
tragedy
by
john
dorset
vampire
a
play
by
alexander
dumas
and
vampire
or
the
bride
of
the
by
planche
were
presented
in
the
london
theater
the
latter
which
was
published
in
is
remarkably
similar
to
a
novelette
by
polidori
published
in
the
story
written
after
the
famous
ghost
session
where
byron
the
shelleys
and
polidori
agreed
each
to
write
a
ghostly
story
mary
shelley
writing
polidori
story
like
the
play
referred
to
has
for
its
principal
character
an
englishman
lord
ruthven
the
earl
of
marsden
who
is
the
vampire
in
each
case
there
is
a
supposed
death
where
the
dying
man
asks
that
his
body
be
placed
where
the
last
rays
of
the
moon
can
fall
upon
it
the
corpse
then
mysteriously
vanishes
in
each
story
there
is
a
complication
of
a
rash
pledge
of
silence
made
by
a
man
that
discovers
the
diabolical
nature
of
the
earl
who
having
risen
from
the
dead
is
ravaging
society
as
a
vampire
in
each
case
a
peculiar
turn
of
the
story
is
that
the
masculine
vampire
requires
for
his
subsistence
the
blood
of
young
women
to
whom
he
must
be
married
he
demands
a
new
victim
hence
a
hurried
wedding
is
planned
in
the
play
the
ceremony
is
interrupted
by
the
bride
father
but
in
the
novelette
the
plot
is
finished
and
the
girl
becomes
the
victim
of
the
destroyer
it
is
a
question
which
of
these
productions
was
written
first
and
which
imitated
the
other
or
if
they
had
a
common
source
the
author
of
the
drama
admits
getting
his
material
from
a
french
play
but
where
did
polidori
get
his
byron
seems
to
have
been
fascinated
with
the
vampire
theme
for
in
addition
to
his
unsuccessful
short
story
he
has
used
the
theme
in
his
poem
here
he
brings
in
the
idea
that
the
vampire
curse
is
a
judgment
from
god
for
sin
and
that
the
most
terrible
part
of
the
punishment
is
the
being
forced
to
prey
upon
those
who
in
life
were
dearest
to
him
which
idea
occurs
in
various
stories
but
first
on
earth
as
vampyre
sent
thy
corse
shall
from
its
tomb
be
rent
then
ghastly
haunt
thy
native
place
and
suck
the
blood
of
all
thy
race
there
from
thy
at
midnight
drain
the
stream
of
life
yet
loathe
the
banquet
which
perforce
must
feed
thy
livid
living
corse
thy
victims
ere
they
yet
expire
shall
know
the
demon
for
their
sire
as
cursing
thee
thou
cursing
them
thy
flowers
are
withered
on
the
stem
but
one
that
for
thy
crime
must
fall
the
youngest
of
all
shall
bless
thee
with
a
name
that
word
shall
wrap
thy
heart
in
flame
yet
must
thou
end
the
task
and
mark
her
cheek
last
tinge
her
eye
last
spark
and
the
last
glassy
glance
must
view
which
freezes
its
lifeless
blue
then
with
unhallowed
hand
shall
tear
the
tresses
of
her
yellow
hair
of
which
in
life
a
lock
when
shorn
affection
fondest
pledge
was
worn
but
now
is
borne
away
by
thee
memorial
of
thine
agony
yet
with
thine
own
best
blood
shall
drip
thy
gnashing
teeth
and
haggard
lip
then
stalking
to
thy
sullen
grave
go
and
with
ghouls
and
afrits
rave
till
these
in
horror
shrink
away
from
specter
more
accursed
than
they
southey
in
his
shows
us
a
vampire
a
young
girl
in
this
case
who
has
been
torn
away
from
her
husband
on
their
wedding
day
the
curse
impels
her
to
attack
him
to
seek
to
drain
his
lifeblood
he
becomes
aware
of
the
truth
and
takes
her
father
with
him
to
the
tomb
to
await
her
coming
forth
at
midnight
which
is
the
striking
hour
for
vampires
when
she
appears
in
her
eyes
a
brightness
more
terrible
than
all
the
loathsomeness
of
death
her
father
has
the
courage
to
strike
a
lance
through
her
heart
to
dispel
the
demon
and
let
her
soul
be
at
peace
then
howling
with
the
wound
the
fiendish
tenant
fled
and
garmented
with
glory
in
their
sight
oneiza
spirit
stood
keats
uses
the
greek
idea
of
the
vampire
as
a
lamia
or
beautiful
young
woman
luring
young
men
to
death
the
same
theme
employed
by
goethe
in
his
braut
von
in
when
the
evil
spirit
in
the
form
of
a
lovely
alluring
woman
is
accused
by
the
old
philosopher
she
gives
a
terrible
scream
and
vanishes
this
vanishing
business
is
a
favorite
trick
with
vampires
they
leave
suddenly
when
circumstances
crowd
them
marion
crawford
in
the
blood
is
the
has
given
us
a
terrible
vampire
story
in
which
the
dream
element
is
present
to
a
marked
degree
the
young
man
who
has
been
vainly
loved
by
a
young
girl
is
after
her
death
vampirized
by
her
something
after
the
fashion
of
turgeniev
clara
militch
and
when
his
friends
get
an
inkling
of
the
truth
and
go
to
rescue
him
they
find
him
on
her
grave
a
thin
red
line
of
blood
trickling
from
his
throat
and
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
played
upon
another
face
that
looked
up
from
the
feast
upon
two
deep
dead
eyes
that
saw
in
spite
of
death
upon
parted
lips
redder
than
life
itself
upon
gleaming
teeth
on
which
glistened
a
rosy
drop
the
hawthorne
stake
is
driven
through
her
heart
and
the
vampire
expires
after
a
terrific
struggle
uttering
diabolic
human
shrieks
there
is
a
certain
similarity
between
this
and
gautier
morte
where
the
truth
is
concealed
till
the
last
of
the
story
and
only
the
initiated
would
perhaps
know
that
the
reincarnated
woman
was
a
vampire
it
is
also
a
bit
like
turgeniev
where
a
subtle
suggestion
at
the
last
gives
the
reader
the
clue
to
vampirism
though
the
author
really
asks
the
question
at
the
close
was
she
a
vampire
the
character
of
the
woman
is
problematic
here
as
in
gautier
story
less
pronounced
than
in
crawford
the
idea
of
occult
vampirism
used
by
turgeniev
is
also
employed
by
reginald
hodder
in
his
work
here
peculiar
power
is
possessed
by
a
woman
leader
of
an
occult
band
who
vampirizes
by
means
of
a
talisman
her
ravages
are
psychic
rather
than
physical
theosophists
according
to
the
believe
in
vampires
even
in
the
present
according
to
their
theory
one
who
has
been
very
wicked
in
life
is
in
death
so
inextricably
entangled
with
his
evil
motives
and
acts
that
he
is
hopelessly
lost
and
knows
it
yet
seeks
to
delay
for
a
time
his
final
damnation
he
can
ward
off
spiritual
death
so
long
as
he
can
keep
alive
by
means
of
blood
his
physical
corpse
the
believes
that
probably
only
those
acquainted
with
black
magic
in
their
lifetime
can
become
vampires
a
thought
comforting
to
some
of
us
it
is
in
bram
stoker
that
one
finds
the
tensest
most
dreadful
modern
story
of
vampirism
this
novel
seems
to
omit
no
detail
of
terror
for
every
aspect
of
vampire
horror
is
touched
upon
with
brutal
and
ghastly
effect
the
combination
of
ghouls
vampires
ghosts
werewolves
and
other
awful
elements
is
almost
unendurable
yet
the
book
loses
in
effect
toward
the
last
for
the
mind
can
not
endure
four
hundred
pages
of
vampiric
outrage
and
respond
to
fresh
impressions
of
horror
the
initial
vampire
here
is
a
hungarian
count
who
after
terrorizing
his
own
country
for
years
transports
himself
to
england
to
start
his
ravages
there
each
victim
in
turn
becomes
a
vampire
the
combination
of
modern
science
with
medieval
superstition
to
fight
the
scourge
using
garlic
and
sprigs
of
the
wild
rose
together
with
blood
transfusion
is
interesting
all
the
resources
of
modern
science
are
pitted
against
the
infection
and
the
complications
are
dramatically
thrilling
the
book
is
not
advised
as
suitable
reading
for
one
sitting
alone
at
night
there
are
other
types
of
vampirism
in
addition
to
the
conventional
theme
and
the
occult
vampirism
wells
gives
his
customary
twist
of
novelty
to
supernaturalism
by
the
introduction
of
a
botanical
vampire
in
his
flowering
of
the
strange
an
orchid
collector
is
found
unaccountably
dead
in
a
jungle
in
the
andaman
islands
with
a
strange
bulb
lying
under
him
which
bulb
is
brought
to
england
and
watched
carefully
by
a
botanist
there
till
it
comes
to
flower
when
at
last
its
blossoms
burst
open
great
tentacles
reach
out
to
grasp
the
man
sucking
his
blood
and
strangling
him
the
tentacles
dripping
blood
have
to
be
torn
away
and
the
man
snatched
violently
from
the
plant
just
in
time
to
save
his
life
algernon
blackwood
who
has
touched
upon
every
terrible
aspect
of
supernaturalism
gives
us
two
types
of
vampires
in
his
story
the
one
is
a
psychic
vampire
stealing
the
vital
power
from
others
a
human
sponge
absorbing
the
strength
the
ideas
the
soul
of
others
the
governess
describes
him
i
watched
his
hard
bleak
face
i
noticed
how
thin
he
was
and
the
curious
oily
brightness
of
his
steady
eyes
and
everything
he
said
or
did
announced
what
i
may
dare
to
call
the
of
his
presence
this
human
vampire
comes
in
contact
with
one
of
another
sort
a
soil
vampire
the
forbidden
corner
a
bald
sore
place
in
the
rose
garden
like
a
dangerous
bog
the
woman
and
a
little
child
know
the
truth
of
this
spot
so
barren
in
the
midst
of
luxurious
growth
so
sinister
in
its
look
and
implication
the
child
says
of
it
it
bad
it
hungry
it
dying
because
it
ca
get
the
food
it
wants
but
i
know
what
would
make
it
feel
right
the
earth
vampire
stretches
out
silent
feelers
from
its
secret
strength
when
the
man
comes
near
the
evil
spot
the
empty
yawning
spot
gives
out
audible
cries
then
laughs
hideously
as
the
man
falls
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
patch
his
eyes
as
he
dropped
faded
shockingly
and
across
the
countenance
was
written
plainly
what
i
can
only
call
an
expression
of
destruction
the
man
lives
on
physically
yet
without
vitality
without
real
life
but
it
was
otherwise
with
the
forbidden
corner
for
soon
it
lay
untouched
full
of
great
luscious
driving
weeds
and
creepers
very
strong
and
bursting
thick
with
life
and
so
the
vampire
stories
vary
in
theme
and
in
treatment
indian
appearing
in
english
show
that
the
or
of
india
is
a
cousin
to
the
vampire
for
he
can
steal
your
liver
by
just
looking
at
you
it
has
long
been
known
that
hearts
can
be
filched
in
this
way
but
the
liver
wrinkle
is
a
new
one
there
are
several
points
to
be
noted
in
connection
with
these
stories
of
the
the
incorruptible
corpses
the
loathsome
spirits
that
haunt
the
living
many
of
the
stories
have
a
setting
in
the
countries
where
the
vampire
superstition
has
been
most
common
though
there
are
english
settings
as
well
continental
countries
are
richer
in
vampire
lore
than
england
which
explains
the
location
of
the
incidents
even
in
many
english
stories
and
poems
another
point
to
be
noted
is
the
agreement
of
the
stories
in
the
essential
features
while
there
are
numerous
variants
of
course
there
is
less
divergence
than
in
the
case
of
ghosts
for
instance
the
description
of
the
dæmonic
spirit
tenanting
the
body
of
a
dead
person
driving
him
by
a
dreadful
urge
to
attack
the
living
especially
those
dear
to
him
in
life
is
much
the
same
the
personality
of
the
vampire
may
vary
in
one
line
of
stories
being
a
young
woman
who
lures
men
to
death
in
the
other
a
man
who
must
quench
his
thirst
with
the
blood
of
brides
these
are
the
usual
types
though
there
are
other
variants
werewolf
and
another
dæmonic
figure
popular
in
fiction
is
the
werewolf
the
idea
is
a
very
old
one
having
been
mentioned
by
various
classical
writers
it
is
said
including
pomponius
mela
herodotus
and
ovid
the
legend
of
the
werewolf
is
found
in
practically
all
european
countries
especially
those
where
the
wolf
is
common
in
france
many
stories
of
the
are
current
the
werewolf
is
a
human
being
cursed
with
the
power
or
the
obligation
to
be
transformed
into
an
animal
who
goes
forth
to
slay
and
devour
like
a
vampire
he
might
become
such
as
a
curse
from
god
or
he
might
be
an
innocent
victim
or
might
suffer
from
an
atavistic
tendency
a
cannibalistic
craving
for
blood
distinction
is
to
be
made
between
the
real
werewolf
and
the
lycanthrope
the
latter
a
human
being
who
on
account
of
some
peculiar
twist
of
insanity
fancies
himself
a
wolf
and
acts
accordingly
there
is
such
a
character
in
duchess
of
a
maniac
who
thinks
himself
a
mad
wolf
and
another
in
a
creature
that
crouches
in
a
corner
of
its
lair
gnawing
at
a
skull
snatched
from
the
graveyard
uttering
bestial
growls
algernon
blackwood
has
a
curdling
story
of
lycanthropy
where
the
insane
man
will
eat
nothing
but
raw
meat
and
devours
everything
living
that
he
can
get
hold
of
he
confesses
to
a
visitor
that
he
used
to
bite
his
old
servant
but
that
he
gave
it
up
since
the
old
jew
tasted

stories
of
lycanthropy
illustrate
an
interesting
aspect
of
the
association
between
insanity
and
the
supernatural
in
fiction
the
most
revolting
story
of
lycanthropy
is
in
frank
norris
posthumous
novel
and
the
this
is
a
study
in
soul
degeneration
akin
to
the
moral
decay
that
george
eliot
has
shown
in
the
character
of
tito
melema
but
grosser
and
utterly
lacking
in
artistic
restraint
we
see
a
young
man
at
first
sensitive
delicate
and
with
high
ideals
gradually
through
love
of
ease
and
through
taking
always

and
uttering
harsh
raucous
cries
of

mark
of
the
is
midway
between
a

and
a
werewolf
story
for
while
the
soul
of

his

while
lycanthropy
has
never
been
a
frequent
theme
in

the
werewolf
is
a
common
figure
appearing
in
various
forms
of
literature
from
medieval
ballads
and
legends
to
modern
short
stories
marie
de
france
the
writer
tells
of
a
werewolf
that
is
by
day
a
gallant
knight
and
kindly
gentleman
yet
goes
on
nocturnal
marauding
expeditions
when
his
wife
shows
curiosity
concerning
his
absences
and
presses
him
for
an
explanation
he
reluctantly
tells
her
that
he
is
a
werewolf
hiding
his
clothes
in
a
hollow
tree
and
that
if
they
were
removed
he
would
have
to
remain
a
wolf
she
has
her
lover
steal
his
clothes
then
marries
the
lover
one
day
long
afterward
the
king
attention
is
called
to
a
wolf
that
runs
up
to
him
and
acts
strangely
it
is
a
tame
and
beast
till
the
false
knight
and
his
wife
appear
when
he
tries
to
tear
their
throats
investigation
reveals
the
truth
the
clothes
are
fetched
and
the
curse
removed
arthur
modern
version
of
this
as
of
others
of
is
charming
in
her
lay
of
like
the
vampire
the
werewolf
is
under
a
curse
that
impels
him
to
prey
upon
those
dearest
to
him
controlled
by
a
dæmonic
spirit
the
human
being
that
in
his
normal
personality
is
kindly
and
gentle
becomes
a
jungle
beast
with
ravening
instincts
the
motif
is
obviously
tangled
up
with
the
vampire
superstition
here
and
it
would
be
interesting
if
possible
to
trace
out
the
two
to
a
point
of
combination
this
irresistible
impulse
to
slay
his
dear
ones
introduces
a
dramatic
element
into
the
plot
here
as
in
the
vampire
stories
the
wolf
is
not
the
only
animal
around
whom
such
plots
center
but
being
most
common
he
has
given
his
name
to
the
type
tell
of
a
young
husband
who
as
a
werewolf
slays
his
bride
then
vanishes
to
be
seen
no
more
there
are
interesting
variants
of
the
werewolf
story
introducing
other
elements
of
supernaturalism
in
vendetta
of
the
we
have
the
idea
of
successive
infection
of
the
moral
curse
similar
to
the
continuation
of
vampirism
crump

by
a

this

conventions
of

serious
credence
to
the
existence
of
werewolves
not
only
in
the
past
but
also
in
the
present
he
tells
a
number
of
stories
of
what
he
claims
are
authenticated
instances
of
such
beings
in
actual
life
he
relates
the
experience
of
a
man
who
told
him
that
he
had
himself
seen
a
youth
turn
himself
into
a
tiger

werewolf
stories
of
england
in
recent
times
giving
the
dates
and
places
and
names
of
the
persons
who
saw
the

the
incidents
may
be
similar
to
those
spoken
of
in
dickens
where
the
famous
woman
with
the
howl
was
seen
or
at
least
many
persons
saw
the
owl
and
knew
that
the
woman
must
be
near
by
these
witnesses
of
werewolves
may
have
seen
animals
all
right
enough
modernity
is
combined
with
medieval
superstition
here
and
it
seems
uncanny
for
instance
to
identify
a
werewolf
by
means
of
an
electric
pocket
flashlight
in
collections
of
the
tribal
legends
of
the
american
redmen
as
well
as
of
kipling
india
and
of
england
there
are
various
stories
of
werewolves
among
primitive
peoples
there
is
a
close
relation
between
the
brute
and
the
human
and
the
attributing
of
human
characteristics
and
powers
to
the
beast
and
is
common
so
that
this
supernatural
transfer
of
personality
is
natural
enough
a
madwolf
might
suggest
the
idea
for
a
werewolf
algernon
blackwood
advances
the
theory
that
the
werewolf
is
a
true
psychical
fact
of
profound
importance
however
it
may
have
been
garbled
by
superstition
he
thinks
that
the
werewolf
is
the
projection
of
the
untamed
slumbering
sanguinary
instincts
of
man
scouring
the
world
in
his
fluidic
body
the
body
of
desire
as
the
mind
wanders
free
from
the
conscious
control
of
the
will
in
sleep
so
the
body
may
free
itself
from
the
fetters
of
mind
or
of
custom
and
go
forth
in
elemental
form
to
satisfy
its
craving
to
slay
to
slake
its
wild
thirst
for
blood
says
that
werewolves
may
be
phantasms
of
the
dead
that
can
not
be
at
peace
or
a
certain
kind
of
elementals
he
also
thinks
that
they
may
be
the
projection
of
one
phase
of
man
nature
of
the
cruelty
latent
in
mankind
that
seeks
expression
in
this
way
according
to
that
theory
a
chap
might
have
a
whole
menagerie
inside
him
to
turn
loose
at
intervals
which
would
be
exciting
but
rather
risky
for
society
it
was
doubtless
a
nature
such
as
this
that
maupassant
attempts
to
describe
in
his
story
where
the
man
has
all
the
instincts
of
the
wolf
yet
never
changes
his
human
form
the
werewolf
in
fiction
has
suffered
the
same
leveling
influence
that
we
have
observed
in
the
case
of
the
ghost
the
devil
the
witch
and
the
vampire
he
is
becoming
a
more
psychical
creature
a
romantic
figure
to
be
sympathized
with
rather
than
a
beast
to
be
utterly
condemned
in
recent
fiction
the
werewolf
is
represented
as
an
involuntary
and
even
unconscious
departure
from
the
human
who
is
shocked
when
he
learns
the
truth
about
himself
whether
he
be
the
victim
of
a
divine
curse
an
agent
of
atavistic
tendencies
or
a
being
who
thus
gives
vent
to
his
real
and
brutish
instincts
we
feel
a
sympathy
with
him
we
analyze
his
motives
at
a
safe
distance
seek
to
understand
his
vagaries
and
to
estimate
his
kinship
with
us
we
think
of
him
now
as
a
noble
figure
in
fiction
a
lupine
galahad
like
blackwood
a
renunciatory
hero
like
eugene
or
what
not
or
we
reflect
that
he
may
be
a
case
of
metempsychosis
and
treat
him
courteously
for
who
knows
what
we
may
be
ourselves
some
day
the
werewolf
has
not
figured
in
poetry
or
in
the
drama
as
have
other
supernatural
beings
as
the
ghost
the
devil
the
witch
the
vampire
one
wonders
why
he
is
a
dramatic
figure
and
his
might
well
furnish
themes
for
poetry
though
stage
presentation
would
have
its
difficulties
perhaps
the
revival
of
interest
in
elizabethan
literature
has
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
use
of
supernatural
beings
in
literature
of
recent
times
the
devil
and
the
dæmonic
spirits
he
controls
the
witches
and
wizards
the
vampires
the
enchanted
animals
to
whom
he
delegates
a
part
of
his
infernal
power
appear
as
impressive
moral
allegories
mystical
stories
of
life
symbols
of
truths
as
literature
is
a
reflection
of
life
the
evil
as
well
as
the
good
enters
in
but
since
the
things
of
the
spirit
are
intangible
they
must
be
represented
in
concrete
form
as
definite
beings
whom
our
minds
can
apprehend
thus
the
poets
and
dramatists
and
must
show
us
images
to
shadow
forth
spiritual
things
as
with
a
shudder
we
close
the
books
that
tell
us
horrifying
tales
of
satanic
spirits
of
accursed
beings
that
are
neither
wholly
animal
nor
human
of
mortals
with
diabolic
powers
we
shrink
from
the
evils
of
the
soul
that
they
represent
and
recognize
their
essential
truth
in
the
guise
of
fiction
chapter
v
supernatural
life
the
fiction
dealing
with
immortal
life
shows
more
than
any
other
aspect
of
the
subject
humanity
deep
hunger
for
the
supernatural
whether
it
be
stories
of
continuance
of
earthly
existence
without
death
as
in
the
legends
of
the
undying
persons
like
the
wandering
jew
or
of
supernaturally
renewed
or
preserved
youth
as
described
in
the
tales
of
the
elixir
of
life
or
of
the
transference
of
the
soul
after
death
into
another
body
or
of
life
continued
in
the
spirit
in
other
worlds
than
this
after
the
body
death
all
show
our
craving
for
something
above
and
beyond
what
we
know
here
and
now
conscious
of
our
own
helplessness
we
long
to
feel
ourselves
leagued
with
immortal
powers
shrinking
affrighted
from
the
grave
near
brink
we
yearn
for
that
which
would
spare
us
death
sting
and
victory
sadly
knowing
with
what
swift
relentless
pace
old
age
is
overtaking
us
we
would
fain
find
something
to
give
us
eternal
youth
but
since
we
can
not
have
these
gifts
in
our
own
persons
we
seek
them
vicariously
in
fiction
and
for
a
few
leisured
forgetfulness
we
are
endowed
with
immortal
youth
and
joy
or
looking
past
death
we
can
feel
ourselves
more
than
conquerors
in
a
life
beyond
oh
world
unknowable
we
touch
thee
inapprehensible
we
clutch
thee
we
somehow
snatch
a
strange
comfort
from
these
stories
of
a
life
beyond
our
own
we
are
comforted
for
our
mortality
when
we
see
the
tragedy
that
dogs
the
steps
of
those
who
may
not
die
whether
swift
loathsome
struldbrugs
or
the
wandering
jew
our
own
ignorance
of
the
future
makes
us
credulous
of
any
man
dream
of
heaven
and
at
the
same
time
sceptical
of
anybody
else
hell
we
are
such
indestructible
optimists
that
we
can
take
any
sort
of
raw
material
of
fiction
and
transmute
it
into
stuff
that
hope
is
made
of
wandering
there
is
no
legend
more
impressive
than
that
of
the
wandering
jew
and
none
save
the
faust
theme
that
has
so
influenced
literature
the
story
is
as
deathless
as
the
person
it
portrays
and
has
wandered
into
as
many
lands
though
it
is
impossible
to
trace
with
certainty
its
origin
or
first
migrations
there
is
an
arabian
legend
of
one
samiri
who
forever
wanders
crying
touch
me
not
as
there
is
a
buddhist
account
of
a
man
cursed
for
working
miracles
for
show
to
whom
buddha
said
thou
shalt
not
attain
nirvana
while
my
religion
lasts
there
are
similar
chinese
and
indian
versions
and
the
idea
occurs
in
english
where
the
plovers
are
thought
to
be
the
souls
of
those
that
crucified
christ
condemned
to
fly
forever
over
the
world
uttering
their
plaintive
cry
the
first
appearance
of
the
wandering
jew
in
english
literature
is
in
the
chronicles
of
roger
of
wendover
who
reports
the
legend
as
being
told
at
the
monastery
of
albans
by
an
armenian
bishop
in
but
to
hearers
already
familiar
with
it
there
are
two
distinct
versions
of
the
story
appearing
in
english
literature
one
relates
that
the
wanderer
is
a
certain
cartapholus
a
servant
in
pilate
palace
who
struck
jesus
a
brutal
blow
as
he
was
led
forth
to
death
and
to
whom
he
said
thou
shalt
wander
till
i
come
the
other
is
of
german
origin
giving
the
personality
of
ahasuerus
a
shoemaker
of
jerusalem
who
mocked

the
wandering
jew
story
is
cosmopolitan
used
in
the
literature
of
many
lands
in
germany
it
has
engaged
the
attention
of
berthold
auerbach
kingemann
schlegel
julius
mosen
and
chamisso
in
france
that
of
edgar
quinet
and
eugene
sue
hans
christian
andersen
has
used
it
while
heijermans
has
written
a
dutch
play
on
it
and
carmen
sylva
late
queen
of
roumania
made
it
the
basis
for
a
long
dramatic
poem
the
theme
has
appeared
in
various
forms
in
english
literature
besides
in
fiction
where
it
has
been
most
prominent
a
comedy
was
published
in
by
andrew
franklin
though
the
wanderer
is
here
used
only
as
a
hoax
wordsworth
has
a
poem
entitled
the
of
the
wandering
and
shelley
was
fascinated
by
the
legend
as
we
see
from
the
fact
that
he
used
it
three
times
one
of
his
first
poems
a
long
dramatic
attempt
written
at
eighteen
is
wandering
a
fevered
poem
showing
the
same
weaknesses
that
his
gothic
romances
reveal
yet
with
a
hint
of
his
later
power
the
wandering
jew
appears
as
a
definite
character
in
both
and
in
the
first
ahasuerus
being
summoned
to
testify
concerning
god
while
he
appears
in
the
latter
to
give
supernatural
vision
of
events
in
both
poems
he
is
very
old
for
in
the
first
it
is
said
wandering
or
his
port
and
mien
bore
marks
of
many
years
yet
his
cheek
bore
the
mark
of
youth
while
in
the
latter
he
is
described
as
being
so
old
he
seems
to
have
outlived
a
world
decay
shelley
follows
the
german
version
as
used
in
a
fragment
he
picked
up
torn
and
soiled
in
lincoln
inn
fields
whose
author
he
did
not
know
in
a
long
dramatic
poem
of
considerable
power
tells
the
story
of
theudas
who
could
be
released
from
his
doom
of
immortality
if
only
he
would
repent
but
he
will
not
he
renews
his
youth
every
forty
years
growing
suddenly
from
a
decrepit
man
to
a
handsome
gifted
youth
which
naturally
suggests
complications
of
human
other
elements
of
supernaturalism
are
used
as
angels
demons
and
so
forth
while
the
æons
and
the
intermedii
whoever
they
are
appear
as
chorus
curse
of
the
wandering
wandering
jew
a
christmas
retells
the
story
with
variations
and
with
some
power
the
jew
here
is
shown
to
be
very
old
and
feeble
clad
in
antique
raiment
with
stigmata
of
the
wounds
on
hands
and
feet
he
is
symbolic
of
the
christ
of
his
failure
to
win
men

by
robert
buchanan
the
wandering
jew
is
seen
definitely
once
in
gothic
fiction
in
where
a
mysterious
stranger
bearing
on
his
forehead
a
burning
cross
imprinted
appears
and
is
spoken
of
as
the
wandering
jew
he
is
unable
to
stay
more
than
fourteen
days
in
any
one
place
but
must
forever
hurry
on
rev
clark
gives
a
view
of
history
such
as
a
person
of
the
long
life
and
extensive
migrations
of
the
wanderer
would
see
it
in
wandering
or
the
and
observations
of
bareach
the
the
idea
of
a
deathless
man
appealed
strongly
to
hawthorne
who
plays
with
the
theme
in
various
passages
in
his
works
and
notebooks
in
virtuoso
where
peter
rugg
the
missing
man
is
and
where
the
collection
includes
a
letter
from
the
flying
dutchman
to
his
wife
together
with
a
flask
of
the
elixir
of
life
the
virtuoso
himself
is
none
other
than
the
wandering
jew
he
speaks
of
his
destiny
and
says
that
human
prayers
will
not
avail
to
aid
him
the
touch
of
his
hand
is
like
ice
conveying
a
sense
of
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
chill
the
character
appears
also
as
one
of
the
guests
in
select
of
whom
the
author
remarks
this
personage
however
had
latterly
grown
so
common
by
mingling
in
all
sorts
of
society
and
appearing
at
the
beck
of
every
entertainer
that
he
could
hardly
be
deemed
a
proper
guest
in
an
exclusive
circle
this
bit
of
satire
illustrates
how
common
the
theme
had
become
at
that
time
in
fiction
there
are
various
threads
of
narration
tangled
up
with
the
wandering
jew
motif
he
is
said
by
some
writers
to
have
supernatural
power
to
heal
disease
while
by
others
he
is
thought
to
be
the
helpless
bearer
of
evil
and
death
eugène
sue
in
his
novel
represents
him
as
carrying
the
plague
knowing
his
awful
destiny
yet
while
wildly
regretting
it
powerless
in
the
clutch
of
fate
here
he
appears
as
a
voluntary
agent
of
good
toward
the
rennepont
family
and
an
involuntary
minister
of
evil
in
other
ways
an
anonymous
story
uses
the
same
idea
of
the
plague
association
but
carries
it
further
for
here
the
wanderer
is
not
a
personality
but
the
plague
itself
passing
like
a
doom
over
the
world
which
shows
how
far
that
phase
of
the
legend
has
gone
the
track
of
the
wandering
the
legend
has
been
utilized
variously
to
impress
religious
truths
charles
granville
writes
a
symbolic
story
with
a
definite
religious
message
the
idea
of
the
immortal
wanderer
is
represented
as
the
concept
of
a
part
of
humanity
urged
by
an
earnest
longing
which
dominates
their
whole
life
and
thought
the
desire
that
a
new
kingdom
of
god
might
come
the
book
is
a
social
satire
an
appeal
for
the
coming
of
a
real
democracy
real
justice
and
genuine
spirituality
george
croly
has
for
his
purpose
the
proving
that
christ
second
coming
is
near
at
hand
lew
wallace
who
himself
uses
the
theme
of
the
wanderer
thought
this
book
one
of
the
half
dozen
volumes
which
taken
alone
would
constitute
a
british
literature
we
are
likely
to
find
ourselves
questioning
wallace
judgment
in
the
matter
for
while
the
novel
is
interesting
and
has
a
sermon
impressed
with
some
interest
it
is
by
no
means
a
great
piece
of
literature
salathiel
is
pictured
as
a
young
enthusiastic
passionate
jew
striving
to
defend
his
country
against
the
woes
that
threaten
her
his
life
is
given
in
detail
immediately
following
his
unpardonable
sin
and
his
definite
career
ends
with
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
though
his
immortality
is
suggested
at
the
close
the
book
describes
many
supernatural
happenings
the
miraculous
phenomena
accompanying
the
death
of
christ
and
manifestations
following
the
fate
of
the
city
in
plaint
of
the
wandering
in
the
or
thou
till
i
in
lew
wallace
prince
of
the
deathless
man
appears
again
in
the
beginning
of
the
story
he
enters
a
vault
from
which
he
removes
the
treasure
from
mummy
cases
remarking
that
the
place
has
not
been
visited
since
he
was
there
a
thousand
years
before
he
has
numerous
impressive
experiences
such
as
seeing
a
monk
that
seems
the
reincarnation
of
jesus
and
hearing
again
the
centurion
call
to
him
wallace
pictures
the
jew
as
old
a
philosopher
in
contrast
to
salathiel
impetuous
youth
he
is
striving
to
bring
the
sons
of
men
into
closer
spiritual
truth
with
each
other
and
with
god
as
salathiel
tries
to
prevent
the
material
destruction
of
the
city
the
sense
of
responsibility
the
feeling
of
a
mission
toward
others
expressed
in
this
novel
may
be
compared
with
that
of
eugène
sue
wandering
jew
who
acts
as
a
friend
to
the
rennepont
family
protecting
their
interests
against
the
wily
jesuits
the
wandering
jew
has
been
represented
in
many
ways
with
stress
placed
on
various
aspects
of
his
life
and
character
he
has
been
depicted
psychologically
as
a
suffering
human
being
mythologically
to
illustrate
the
growth
and
change
in
life
religiously
to
preach
certain
tenets
and
beliefs
and
symbolically
to
show
forth
the
soul
of
man
he
appears
symbolically
as
the
creature
accursed
of
god
driven
forever
in
the
face
of
doom
shelley
and
others
show
him
as
vainly
attempting
suicide
but
living
on
anguished
yet
deathless
in
the
face
of
every
effort
to
take
his
own
life
as
in
the
teeth
of
torture
from
others
he
stands
at
once
for
the
undying
power
of
god
plan
and
as
in
robert
buchanan
version
for
the
typified
failure
of
christ
mission
he
is
used
to
prove
that
christ
second
coming
is
near
and
to
prove
also
that
he
will
never
come
to
the
christian
he
stands
for
the
evidence
of
christ
power
of
divinity
while
to
the
jew
he
is
a
symbol
of
that
unhappy
race
that
wanders
ever
with
no
home
in
any
land
besides
those
mentioned
other
english
and
american
writers
who
have
made
use
of
the
legend
are
kipling
bram
stoker
who
discusses
him
in
his
assembly
of
famous
impostors
conway
who
gives
various
versions
of
the
story
david
hoffman
henry
seton
merriman
ainsworth
and
others
a
legend
closely
associated
with
this
and
yet
separate
is
that
of
a
woman
who
bore
the
curse
of
eternal
wandering
one
version
brings
in
herodias
as
the
doomed
woman
while
the
character
of
kundry
in
represents
another
feminine
wanderer
william
sharp
in
his
gives
the
story
differently
still
saying
that
it
is
not
correctly
told
in
as
sharp
tells
it
it
is
a
piece
of
tragic
symbolism
kundry
a
gypsy
woman
of
evil
life
mocks
christ
on
golgotha
and
demands
of
him
a
sign
to
whom
he
says
to
thee
and
thine
i
bequeath
the
signs
of
my
passion
to
be
a
shame
and
horror
among
thy
people
forevermore
upon
her
hands
and
feet
appear
the
stigmata
of
his
wounds
never
to
fade
away
and
to
be
borne
by
her
descendants
in
every
third
generation
various
ones
of
her
descendants
are
crucified
and
wherever
the
wanderers
go
on
earth
they
bear
the
marks
of
horror
the
curse
would
be
lifted
from
them
only
when
a
gypsy
christ
should
be
born
of
a
virgin
but
then
the
children
of
the
wind
should
be
dispersed
and
vanish
from
among
men
in
the
last
chapter
naomi
prophesies
that
she
is
to
give
birth
to
the
gypsy
christ
the
theme
of
the
wandering
jew
while
rivalling
the
faust
legend
in
impressiveness
and
in
the
frequence
with
which
it
has
been
used
in
literature
yet
is
different
in
having
had
no
adequate
representation
no
truly
great
poem
or
drama
or
novel
has
been
written
concerning
this
tragic
deathless
character
perhaps
it
may
come
yet
only
hints
of
his
personality
have
appeared
in
very
recent
fiction
such
as
the
reincarnation
in
the
character
of
the
young
jew
in
story
mystery
of
joseph
or
the
humorous
reference
to
him
in
brander
matthews
of
imaginary
or
holy
by
eugene
field
where
the
wanderer
is
pitied
by
a
spanish
priest
in
cortez
train
in
mexico
his
prayers
win
forgiveness
and
the
tortured
jew
dies
after
his
death
an
earthquake
supernaturally
splits
a
gulf
on
each
side
of
the
grave
and
a
cross
of
snow
appears
there
to
remain
forever
perhaps
the
theme
is
fading
out
now
in
fiction
and
drama
to
disappear
completely
or
perhaps
it
is
lying
forgotten
for
a
while
waiting
the
master
hand
that
shall
give
it
adequate
treatment
of
immortality
that
proves
such
a
curse
in
the
case
of
the
wandering
jew
forms
the
basis
for
various
other
stories
the
elixir
of
life
was
a
favorite
theme
with
the
gothicists
being
used
by
maturin
godwin
and
shelley
and
has
continued
to
furnish
complication
for
fiction
since
that
time
the
theme
has
been
popular
on
the
continent
as
well
as
in
england
balzac
and
hoffman
being
the
most
impressive
users
of
it
in
strange
introduces
the
elixir
of
life
together
with
other
forms
of
supernaturalism
such
as
mesmerism
magic
spectral
apparitions
invisible
manifestations
awful
bodiless
eyes
a
gigantic
foot
and
so
forth
margrave
attempts
to
concoct
the
potion
that
shall
give
him
endless
life
but
after
mysterious
preparations
incantations
and
supernatural
manifestations
at
the
crucial
moment
a
stampede
of
maddened
beasts
urged
forward
by
the
dreadful
foot
dashes
the
beaker
from
his
lips
the
irreplaceable
liquid
wastes
its
force
on
the
desert
sands
where
a
magic
richness
of
herbage
instantly
springs
up
in
contrast
to
the
barrenness
around
it
flowers
bloom
myriads
of
insects
hover
round
them
and
all
is
life
but
the
man
who
sought
the
elixir
with
such
pains
lies
dead
the
author
suggests
a
symbolic
meaning
for
his
story
hinting
that
the
scientist
laboratory
holds
many
elixirs
of
life
that
all
growth
and
life
are
magical
that
all
being
is
miraculous
rider
haggard
in
and
its
sequel
describes
a
wonderful
woman
who
possesses
the
secret
of
eternal
life
and
has
lived
for
thousands
of
years
ever
young
and
beautiful
supernaturally
enchanting
her
magic
potion
not
only
gives
her
length
of
days
but
protection
against
danger
as
well
for
her
rival
dagger
glances
harmlessly
away
from
her
and
she
is
proof
against
chance
and
fate
she
gains
her
immortal
life
partly
by
bathing
in
a
secret
essence
or
vapor
whose
emanations
give
her
mystic
force
and
immortal
beauty
there
are
many
other
elements
of
supernaturalism
in
association
with
the
not
impossible
she
magic
vision
reincarnation
a
mystic
light
that
envelops
her
body
the
power
to
call
up
the
dead
to
reanimate
the
skeletons
in
the
desert
and
raise
them
to
dreadful
life
she
is
an
interesting
but
fearsome
personality
in
by
anita
silvani
we
have
magic
chemistry
yielding
up
the
elixir
of
life
has
lived
for
five
hundred
years
and
looks
forward
to
a
still
more
protracted
existence
his
magic
drug
not
only
gives
him
prolonged
life
but
will
do
anything
he
wishes
besides
since
he
has
hypnotized
it
yet
he
is
found
dead
on
his
wrists
were
marks
of
giant
fingers
scorched
and
burnt
into
the
flesh
like
marks
of
hot
iron
and
on
his
throat
were
marks
of
a
similar
hand
which
had
evidently
strangled
him
it
is
apparent
that
his
master
the
got
impatient
and
cut
short
the
leisurely
existence
that
he
felt
belonged
to
him
hawthorne
was
greatly
interested
in
the
theme
of
the
elixir
of
life
he
gives
us
two
brews
of
it
in
one
an
indian
potion
concocted
by
an
old
sachem
the
red
man
gets
so
old
that
his
tribe
find
him
a
great
nuisance
and
obstacle
to
progress
so
they
gravely
request
permission
to
kill
him
but
his
skull
is
so
hard
that
the
stone
hammers
are
smashed
when
they
try
to
brain
him
his
skin
so
tough
that
no
arrows
will
pierce
it
and
nothing
seems
to
avail
finally
they
fill
his
mouth
and
nostrils
with
clay
and
put
him
in
the
sun
to
bake
till
presently
his
heart
bursts
with
a
loud
explosion
tearing
his
body
to
fragments
this
brew
of
his
is
matched
by
one
made
by
an
european
scientist
after
long
endeavors
here
the
ultimate
ingredient
is
supposed
to
be
a
strange
herb
that
grows
from
a
mysterious
grave
at
last
just
when
the
youth
thinks
he
has
the
right
combination
the
woman
who
has
lured
him
on
to
destruction
dashes
the
cup
from
his
lips
saving
him
from
the
poison
he
would
have
drunk
the
flower
has
grown
from
the
grave
of
her
lover
whom
the
young
scientist
has
murdered
in
dolliver
that
pathetic
fragment
hawthorne
left
unfinished
at
his
death
we
find
another
treatment
of
the
theme
it
seems
symbolic
that
in
his
old
age
and
failing
powers
he
should
have
been
thinking
of
immortal
youth
of
deathless
life
in
this
story
various
magical
elements
are
introduced
the
herbs
grown
in
old
grandsir
dolliver
garden
have
a
strange
power
for
when
a
woman
lays
a
flower
from
one
on
her
breast
it
glows
like
a
gem
and
lends
a
bloom
of
youth
to
her
cheeks
the
old
man
seeks
the
one
unknown
essence
the
incalculable
element
necessary
to
make
up
the
elixir
of
life
as
did
the
youth
in
he
drinks
occasional
mouthfuls
of
a
strange
cordial
that
he
finds
in
an
old
bottle
on
the
shelf
and
seems
to
grow
younger
and
stronger
he
too
like
septimius
has
a
visitor
a
man
that
demands
the
cordial
as
belonging
to
him
by
ancestral
right
snatches
it
from
the
aged
hands
drinks
it
down
at
a
draught
and
grows
violently
young
but
dies
in
convulsions
in
heidigger
hawthorne
gives
us
another
sad
symbolic
story
of
the
quest
of
the
elixir
of
youth
the
old
physician
invites
four
aged
friends
to
make
an
experiment
to
drink
of
a
cordial
which
shall
restore
youth
but
which
he
himself
is
too
wise
to
share
the
strange
potion
proves
its
power
by
restoring
to
beauty
and
perfume
a
rose
that
has
been
dead
for
over
fifty
years
when
the
old
persons
drink
they
become
young
and
happy
and
beautiful
once
more
age
drops
from
them
like
a
mantle
discarded
and
the
world
glows
again
with
passion
and
color
and
joy
but
alas
it
is
only
ephemeral
for
the
effects
soon
pass
away
and
senility
is
doubly
tragic
after
one
snatched
hour
of
joy
and
youth
there
is
a
sad
philosophy
of
life
expressed
in
these
symbolic
allegories
such
as
hawthorne
alone
knows
how
to
tell
elsewhere
hawthorne
shows
his
deep
interest
in
the
theme
in
the
scientist
intimates
that
he
could
brew
the
life
elixir
if
he
would
but
that
it
would
produce
a
discord
in
nature
such
as
all
the
world
and
chiefly
he
that
drank
it
would
curse
at
last
the
subject
is
referred
to
in
other
places
and
a
flask
of
the
precious
dreadful
elixir
is
one
of
the
treasures
in
the
collection
in
a
note
concerning
his
use
of
the
theme
in
dolliver
hawthorne
states
that
he
has
been
accused
of
plagiarizing
from
dumas
but
that
in
reality
dumas
plagiarized
from
him
since
his
book
was
many
years
the
earlier
in
wells
uses
this
theme
combined
with
the
transfer
of
personality
an
aged
man
bargains
with
a
youth
to
make
him
his
heir
on
certain
conditions
the
purpose
unknown
to
the
young
fellow
is
to
rob
him
of
his
youth
to
reanimate
the
old
man
a
magic
drink
transfers
the
personality
of
the
octogenarian
to
the
body
of
youth
and
leaves
the
young
man
soul
cabined
in
the
frame
but
the
drug
is
more
powerful
than
elvesham
supposed
for
it
brings
death
to
both
who
drink
it
and
the
bargain
has
a
ghastly
climax
barry
pain
has
a
somewhat
similar
situation
of
the
tragic
miscalculation
in
wrong
the
story
of
an
alchemist
who
brews
the
potion
but
means
to
keep
it
all
to
himself
on
a
certain
night
he
will
drink
it
and
become
immortally
young
in
a
world
of
dying
men
while
he
waits
a
gypsy
girl
asks
him
to
give
her
a
poison
to
kill
a
man
she
hates
he
prepares
the
potion
for
her
and
sets
it
aside
he
drinks
at
the
time
he
planned
but
instead
of
eternal
life
the
draught
brings
him
death
does
he
drink
the
wrong
elixir
or
have
all
his
calculations
been
wrong
in
story
of
the
late
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
the
magic
of
the
old
fiction
of
supernaturalism
has
been
transferred
into
the
scientific
in
modern
times
is
seen
in

paine
a
man
in
an
upper
room
alone
is
wishing
that
he
had
the
gift
of
immortal
youth
when
a
stranger
in
black
enters
and
answers
his
thought
he
tells
him
that
to
read
the
mind
is
not
black
magic
but
science
that
he
is
not
a
magician
but
a
scientist
and
as
such
he
has
compounded
the
elixir
of
youth
which
he
will
give
to
him
this
drug
will
enable
a
man
to
halt
his
age
at
any
year
he
chooses
and
to
make
it
permanent
as
peter

their
the
stranger
leaves
the

with
the

and
goes
away

the
one
who
wished
for
immortal
life
decides
that
after
all
god
must
know
best
and
though
his
decision
not
to
drink
has
not
crystalized
he
is
not
greatly
sorry
when
the
flask
is
shattered
and
the
liquid
spilled

is
symbolic
of
the
real
wisdom
of
life
the
frequent
use
of
the

it
is
not

a
burlesque
we
may
suppose
he
adds
a
touch
of
realism
to

by
the
fact
that

i

never

he

pursued

never

haunted
soul
pursued
by
its
own
destiny
in
strange
adventures
of
phra
the
in
his
the
theme
of
the
elixir
of
life
is
one
of
the
old
motifs
of
supernaturalism
retained
in
modern
fiction
the
conventional
alchemist
has
given
place
to
a
more
investigator
in
the
chemical
laboratory
yet
the
same
thrill
of
interest
is
imparted
by
the
thought
of
a
magic
potion
prepared
by
man
that
shall
endow
him
with
earthly
immortality
the
theme
has
changed
less
in
its
treatment
and
symbolism
than
most
of
the
supernatural
elements
in
fiction
for
though
we
see
the
added
elements
of
modern
satire
and
symbolism
its
essential
aspects
remain
the
same
the
idea
of
metempsychosis
the
thought
that
at
death
the
soul
of
a
human
being
may
pass
into
another
mortal
body
or
into
a
lower
stage
into
an
animal
or
even
a
plant
has
been
used
considerably
in
english
fiction
this
oriental
belief
has
its
basis
in
antiquity
in
animistic
ideas
in
primitive
culture
one
of
the
earliest
appearances
of
the
theme
in
english
fiction
is
that
story
of
john
hawkesworth
an
account
of
a
soul
that
has
not
behaved
itself
seemly
so
descends
in
the
spiritual
scale
till
it
ends
by
being
a
flea
the
german
hoffmann
used
the
theme
repeatedly
and
poe
who
was
to
a
certain
extent
influenced
by
his
supernaturalism
employs
it
in
several
stories
in
tale
of
the
ragged
the
young
man
named
bedlo
experiences
in
dreams
of
extraordinary
vividness
the
life
of
battle
of
confusion
ending
in
death
in
a
tropical
city
he
sees
himself
die
struck
on
the
temple
by
a
poisoned
arrow
he
is
recognized
by
an
elderly
man
as
the
exact
counterpart
of
a
oldeb
who
perished
in
the
manner
dreamed
of
in
a
battle
in
benares
bedlo
while
wandering
in
the
mountains
of
virginia
contracts
a
cold
and
fever
for
the
cure
of
which
leeches
are
applied
but
by
mistake
a
poisonous
sangsue
is
substituted
for
the
leech
and
the
patient
dies
of
a
wound
on
the
temple
similar
to
that
caused
by
a
poisoned
arrow
poe
concept
in
other
stories
is
not
that
of
the
conventionally
easy
passage
of
the
soul
into
the
body
of
a
babe
that
would
be
expected
to
put
up
much
of
a
fight
but
he
makes
the
psychic
feature
the
central
horror
saying
in
that
connection
that
man
is
on
the
brink
of
tremendous
psychical
discoveries
in
the
theme
is
used
with
telling
power
where
the
wife
once
greatly
loved
but
now
loathed
on
her
deathbed
tells
her
husband
that
her
child
will
live
after
her
the
daughter
grows
up
into
supernatural
likeness
of
her
mother
but
remains
nameless
since
her
father
for
a
reason
he
can
not
analyze
hesitates
to
give
her
any
name
but
at
last
as
she
stands
before
the
altar
to
be
christened
some
force
outside
the
father
causes
him
to
call
her
morella
what
more
than
fiend
convulsed
the
features
of
my
child
and
overspread
them
with
the
hues
of
death
as
starting
at
that
scarcely
audible
sound
she
turned
her
glassy
eyes
from
earth
to
heaven
and
falling
prostrate
on
the
black
slabs
of

ancestral
vault

transmigration
of
a
the
young
girl
is
found
to
be
dead
and
the
father
says
with
my
own
hands
i
bore
her
to
the
tomb
and
i
laughed
with
a
long
and
bitter
laugh
as
i
found
no
traces
of
the
first
in
the
charnel
where
i
laid
the
second
morella
an
obvious
imitation
of
poe
story
is
found
in
bram
stoker
novel
jewel
of
seven
where
the
soul
of
an
egyptian
princess
enters
into
the
body
of
a
baby
born
to
one
of
the
explorers
who
rifle
her
tomb
the
child
grows
into
the
perfect
duplicate
of
the
princess
even
showing
on
her
wrists
the
marks
of
violence
that
cut
off
the
mummy
hand
the
egyptian
familiar
a
mummified
cat
comes
to
life
to
revenge
itself
upon
the
archæologists
who
have
disturbed
the
tomb
when
by
magic
incantations
and
scientific
experiments
combined
the
collectors
try
to
revivify
the
mummy
the
body
mysteriously
disappears
and
the
young
girl
is
found
dead
leading
us
to
suppose
that
the
reanimated
princess
has
stolen
the
girl
life
for
her
own
in
another
of
poe
morbid
studies
of
metempsychosis
the
theme
is
clearly
announced
as
quoted
from
joseph
glanville
man
doth
not
yield
himself
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
own
feeble
will
the
worshipped
ligeia
dies
and
in
an
hour
of
madness
her
husband
marries
the
lady
rowena
the
bride
soon
sickens
and
as
the
husband
watches
alone
by
her
bed
at
midnight
he
sees
drops
of
ruby
liquid
fall
from
some
mysterious
source
into
the
wine
he
is
offering
her
when
the
lady
rowena
presently
dies
the
husband
again
alone
with
her
sees
the
corpse
undergo
an
awful
transformation
it
is
reanimated
but
the
body
that
lives
is
not
that
of
rowena
but
of
ligeia
who
has
come
back
to
life
again
by
exerting
her
deathless
will
over
the
physical
being
of
her
rival
the
climax
with
which
the
story
closes
has
perhaps
no
parallel
in
fiction
as
for
the
ruby
drops
are
we
to
think
of
them
as
an
elixir
of
life
for
the
dead
ligeia
struggling
back
to
being
or
as
poison
to
slay
the
living
rowena
ligeia
story
is
reflected
or
at
least
shows
an
evident
influence
in
second
by
mary
heaton
vorse
here
again
the
dead
wife
comes
to
oust
her
supplanter
but
in
this
instance
the
interloper
does
not
die
but
without
dying
merely
the
person
and
the
personality
of
the
first
wife
the
change
is
gradual
but
incontrovertible
felt
by
the
woman
herself
before
it
is
complete
and
noticed
by
the
husband
and
the
here
the
human
will
indestructible
by
death
asserts
itself
over
mortal
flesh
and
effects
a
transfer
of
personality
but
where
did
the
second
wife
soul
go
pray
the
she
o
the
she
as
patience
worth
would
say
a
similar
transfer
of
soul
effected
while
both
persons
are
living
but
caused
by
the
malignance
of
an
evil
dead
spirit
is
found
in
blackwood
terror
of
the
a
father
who
resents
the
fact
that
instead
of
a
single
heir
twins
are
born
to
him
swears
in
his
madness
before
he
dies
that
before
their
majority
he
will
bring
it
to
pass
that
there
shall
be
only
by
the
help
of
powers
from
the
pit
he
filches
from
the
younger
his
vitality
his
strength
of
mind
and
soul
and
body
his
personality
and
gives
this
access
of
power
to
the
elder
the
younger
dies
a
hopeless
idiot
and
the
elder

the

blackwood
has
been
much
drawn
to
psychic
subjects
in
general
and
metempsychosis
in
particular
for
it
enters
into
many
of
his
stories
in
he
gives
us
an
instance
of
a
child
who
knows
herself
to
be
the
reborn
personality
of
some
one
else
and
suffers
poignantly
in
reliving
the

those
around
her
are
recognized
as
the
companions
of
her
life
of
the
far
past
though
they
are
unaware
of
it
the
fatuous
remark
of
lovers
in

that
they
feel
that
they
have
lived
and
loved
each
other
in
a
previous
existence
is
a
literary
bromide
now
but
has
its
basis
in
a
recurrence
in

antonio

the

by
suggestion
the
symbolic
treatment
of
metempsychosis

strongly

lends
itself
particularly

peculiar
story
of
metempsychosis
where
the

himself
suddenly
reinforced
with
a
new
personality
from
without
his
eyes
are
opened
miraculously
to
the
magic

that
his

has
died
and
that
his

the
most
impressive
example
of
this
sudden
merging
of
two
natures
two
souls
into
one
is
found
in
granville

on
here
a
man
suddenly
acquires
or
recognizes
the
power
to
see
the
souls
that
linger
around
him
and
comes
to
have
a
strange
sympathy
with
that
of
a
woman
whom
he
calls
the
little
soul
when
he
speaks
of
going
away
after
a
time
she
begs
him
not
to
leave
her
since
she
is
very
lonely
in
this
wilderness
of
unbodied
souls
she
asks
that
if
he
will
not
take
her
into
his
soul
he
carry
her
to
some
wide
prairie
and
there
in
the
unspaced
expanse
leave
her
but
instead
he
gives
a
reluctant
consent
for
her
to
enter
into
his
life
he
presses
the
little
symbolic
figure
to
his
heart
then

personality

that
her
soul

the
influence
of
modern
spiritualism
and
psychical
research
on
the
literature
of
supernaturalism
has
been
marked
especially
of
late
years
it
would
be
inevitable
that
movements
which
interest
so
many
persons
among
them
many
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
should
be
reflected
in
fiction
these
two
aspects
of
the
subject
will
be
treated
together
since
they
are
closely
allied
for
though
spiritualism
is
a
form
of
religion
and
psychical
research
a
new
science
and
religion
and
science
are
not
always
parallel
the
lines
of
investigation
here
are
similar
while
spiritualism
endeavors
to
get
in
touch
with
the
spirits
of
the
dead
that
the
living
may
be
comforted
and
enlightened
and
psychical
research
attempts
to
classify
the
supposedly
authentic
cases
of
such
communication
and
in
so
much
their
methods
of
approach
are
different
yet
the
results
may
be
discussed
together
hawthorne
was
interested
in
spiritualism
as
literary
material
since
a
discussion
of
it
is
introduced
in
and
various
passages
in
his
notebooks
treat
of
the
matter
showing
the
fascination
it
had
for
him
elizabeth
stuart
phelps
ward
in
addition
to
her
fictional
treatises
of
heaven
takes
up
spiritualism
as
well
in

of

she
gives
a
satiric
account
of
the
return
of
a
spirit
who
says
he
is
a
lost
soul
tortured
in
hell
he
doubtless
deserves
it
for
he
sticks
the
baby
full
of
pins
and
ties
it
to
a
tree
and
folds
the
clothes
from

so
forth
take
place
where
spirit
hands
wave
in
the

and
messages
grave

is
handled
with
skill
to
bring
out
the
sincerity
of
each
person
involved
in
the

belief

real
sympathy

considerable

in
his
fiction
he
refuses

commit

as
to
his

opinion
of
the
question
but
he
has
written
two
novels
dealing
with
it
tyranny
of
the
and
shadow
the
former
is
considerably
like

here
also
a
young

is
made
the
innocent
victim
of
fanatics
her
mother
and
a
preacher
who
has
fallen
in

with
her
she
is
made
to
take
part
in
spiritualistic
manifestations
whether
as
a
victim
of
fraud
or
as
a
genuine
medium
the
author
leaves
in
doubt
when
the
girl
casts
him
off
the
preacher
kills
himself
that
he
may
come
into
closer
communication
with
her
after
death
than
he
has

able

do

years
whether

are

receives
its

humorous
turn
in

who
complains
of
the

though
he

entreated
the
spooks
to
hold
out
for
a
little
while
as
he

was

for
not

have
various
modern

been

well
as
in

about

a
case
of
a
ghost
coming

inherently
true

appeared
all
along
the
line
perhaps
human
personality
is
largely
the
same
in
all
lands
and
all
times
and
ghosts
have
the
same
elemental
emotions
however
much
they
may
have
acquired

veneer
of

of

his

to
drive
back

save

for

which
their
modern
descendants
are
reluctant
to
share
these
stories
are
only
a
few
among
the
many
instances
of
supernaturalism
in
fiction
traceable
to
the
influence
of
the
war
certain
volumes
of
ghost
stories
have
appeared
claiming
to
be
not
fiction
but
fact
accounts
of
actual
apparitions
seen
and
this
sort
of
problematic
fiction
is
not
new
however
since
defoe
long
ago
published
one
of
the
best
of
the
kind
the
story
of
veal
who
appeared
to
her
friend
bargrave
and
conversed
with
her
gravely
telling
her
that
heaven
is
much
like
the
descriptions
in
a
certain
religious
book
written
shortly
before
that
she
seems
very
realistic
with
her
dress
of
newly
scoured
silk
which
her
friend
rubs
between
her
fingers
and
her
lifelike
conversation
this
story
has
usually
been
regarded
as
one
of
defoe
lies
like
truth
but
recent
evidence
leads
one
to
believe
that
it
is
a
reportorial
account
of
a
ghost
story
current
at
the
time
which
missed
being
reported
to
the
society
for
psychical
research
merely
because
the
organization
did
not
exist
then
the
modern
stories
that
stridently
claim
to
be
real
lack
the
interest
in
many
instances
that
veal
is
able
to
impart
and
in
most
cases
the
reader
loses
his
taste
for
that
sort
of
fiction
because
it
is
rammed
down
his
throat
for
fact
they
do
impress
one
either
as
fact
or
as
fiction
one
of
the
most
interesting
aspects
of
the
literature
relating
to
psychic
matters
in
recent
years
is
the
number
of
books
that
claim
to
be
these
instances
of
psychography
are
not
what
we
might
expect
immortals
to
indite
but
it
appears
that
there
must
be
a
marked
decrease
of
intelligence
when
one
reaches
the
other
world
the
messages
sent
back
by
dead
genius
lack
the
master
style
even
lacking
that
control
over
spelling
and
grammar
which
low
editors
consider
necessary
but
perhaps
the
spirits
of
the
great
grow
tired
of
being
made
messenger
boys
and
show
their
resentment
by
literary
strikes
anita
silvani
has
published
several
volumes
that
she
claims
were
written
while
she
was
in
a
which
statement
no
reader
will
doubt
her
accommodating
dictator
furnishes
illustrations
for
her
stuff
as
well
for
she
says
she
would
have
inner
visions
of
the
scenes
described
as
if
a
dioram
passed
before
her
these
romances
of
three
worlds
are
quite
peculiar
productions
the
inner
voices
asked
her
in
advance
not
to
read
any
literature
on
theosophy
or
spiritualism
or
the
supernatural
since
they
wished
her
mind
to
be
free
from
any
previous
bias
elsa
barker
is
another
of
these
literary
mediums
for
she
has
put
out
two
volumes
of
letters
in
narrative
form
which
she
makes
affidavit
were
dictated
to
her
by
a
disembodied
spirit
the
ghost
of
the
late
judge
hatch
of
california
she
states
that
while
she
was
sitting
in
her
room
in
paris
one
day
her
hand
was
violently
seized
a
pencil
thrust
into
it
and
the
automatic
writing
began
is
another
of
these
feminine
stenographers
for
spooks
but
like
the
rest
she
has
left
nothing
that
could
well
be
included
in
a
literary
anthology
these
tell
us
of
life
after
death
but
nothing
that
is
a
contribution
to
existing
ignorance
on
the
subject
according
to
judge
hatch
whose
is
x
the
present
war
has
its
parallel
in
a
conflict
of
spirits
and
the
astral
world
is
in
dire
confusion
because
of
overcrowding
so
that
the
souls
of
the
slain
must
go
through
torments
and
struggle
with
demons
the
most
recent
instance
of
psychography
comes
to
us
by
way
of
the
from

authenticity
of

is
vouched
for
by

as

patience

says
that
she
lived
a
long
time
ago
yost
insists
that
her
language
is
elizabethan
but
it
seems
rather
a
curious
conglomeration
unlike
any
elizabethan
style
i
am
familiar
with
she
has
written
stories
lyrics
a
long
drama
and
other
informal
compositions
a
marvelous
output
when
one
considers
the
slow
movements
of
the
the
communications
seem
to
have
human
interest
and
a
certain
literary
value
though
they
bring
us
no
messages
from
the
elizabethan
section
of

other
examples
of
the
books
that
claim
to
be
inspired
by

are

of
angelic

from
a

standing

corner
of

it
is
astonishing
how

after
all
what
do
the
poor

get
out

no

scant

much
ridicule
when
their
style

to
come
up

specifications
interesting
psychical
material
is
found
in
a
new
volume
of
plays
by
theodore
dreiser
he
gives
curious
twists
to
the
unearthly
as
in

where
a
shadow
and
a
fast
mail
are
among
the
typifying
the
fate
idea
of

track
after
he
has
caused
the

to
leave
the

open
and
the
train
made
very
human
kills
the

the
psychic
effects
in
the
are
even
more
peculiar
the
characters
including
various
spirits
a
wraith
and
a
ghost
with
red
eyes
who
circle
round
the
human
beings
and
force
them
to
discover
a
murder
that
has
been
committed
the
effect
of
supernatural
manifestation
on
animals
is
brought
out
here
in
the
bellowing
of

that
anybody
is
hearing

save
the
four
human
beings
who
have
happened
in
these
dramas
of
course
are
purely
literary
plays
impossible
of
presentation
on
the
stage
and
in
their
curious
character
show
a
likeness
to
some
of
the
late
german
supernaturalism
such
as
the
plays
of
august
stramm
they
show
in
an
extreme
form
the
tendency
toward
psychic
material
that
the
american
and
english
drama
has
evidenced
lately
of
the
natural
and
the
after
mankind
is
immensely
interested
in
heaven
and
hell
though
he
knows
but
little
concerning
these
places
but
man
is
a
born
traveler
and
gives
much
thought
to
distant
countries
whether
he
definitely
expects
to
go
there
or
not
this
interest
is
no
new
thing
for
classical
mythology
is
full
of
doleful
accounts
of
the
after
life
the
early
english
stage
represented
heaven
and
hell
in
addition
to
the
earth
and
elizabethan
drama
shows
many
references
to
the
underworld
with
a
strong
senecan
influence
there
are
especially
frequent
allusions
to
certain
famous
sufferers
in
hades
as
ixion
tantalus
sisyphus
and
tityus
modern
english
fiction
has
likewise
been
influenced
by
the
epic
supernaturalism
reflecting
the
heaven
and
hell
of
dante
and
milton
yet
as
in
his
own
thinking
each
person
lays
out
a
celestial
city
for
himself
and
pictures
his
own
inferno
to
fit
his
ideas
of
mercy
and
justice
peopling
them
with
appropriate
beings
changing
and
coloring
the
conceptions
of
bunyan
for
instance
to
suit
his
own
desires
so
it
is
in
fiction
some
think
of
heaven
and
hell
as
definite
places
while
to
others
they
are
states
of
mind
to
some
the
devil
is
as

while
to
others
he
is
an
iconoclastic
new
thought
heaven
and
hell
have
been
treated
in
every
conceivable
way
in
english
fiction
conventionally
symbolically
humorously
and
satirically
so
that
one
may
choose
the
type
he
prefers
there
are
enough
kinds
to
go
around
among
the
portrayers
of
the
traditional
heaven
and
hell
elizabeth
stuart
phelps
ward
is
prominent
her
works
on
contemporary
immortality
are
said
to
have
had
a
tremendous
vogue
in
the
period
following
the
civil
war
when
death
had
claimed
so
many
that
the
living
were
thinking
of
the
other
world
more
than
of
this
her
pictures
of
heaven
in
are
comforting
for
she
assures
to
each
person
his
own
dearest
wish
in
fulfillment
to
the
ambitious
youth
his
books
to
the
young
girl
her
piano
and
to
the
small
child
her
instead
of
earthly
bread
and
butter
in
gates
the
physician
suddenly
killed
finds
himself
embarrassed
by
immortality
he
know
how
to
adjust
himself
to
eternity
and
at
first
brings
many
of
earth
problems
with
him
in
the
third
of
the
series
gates
she
describes
a
very
material
yet
spiritual
heaven
bodies
are
much
like
those
on
earth
not
vaporous
projections
there
are
museums
hospitals
universities
telephones
concerts
and
all
improvements
and
conveniences
the
dead
woman
discovers
that
she
remembers
what
she
read
on
earth
takes
pleasure
in
simple
things
such
as
the
smell
of
mignonette
hears
the
birds
sing
a
te
deum
while
a
brook
and
a
bird
sing
a
duet
and
the
leaves
are
also
vocal
there
is
a
universal
language
which
must
be
learned
by
each
soul
and
heaven
holds
all
sorts
of
occupations
material
mental
and
spiritual
she
says
that
near
earth
are
many
spirits
occupied
in
low
and
coarse
and
selfish
ways
who
lack
spiritual
momentum
to
get
away
they
loved
nothing
lived
for
nothing
believed
in
nothing
they
cultivated
themselves
for
nothing
but
the
earth
which
may
be
compared
with
the
state
of
the
souls
on
fifth
avenue
described
by
granville
barker
ward
pictures
of
heaven
may
seem
sentimental
and
conventional
to
us
yet
to
be
appreciated
they
must
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
religious
thought
of
her
time
she
represented
a
reaction
against
the
rigid
theology
the
stern
concepts
of
an
older
generation
than
her
own
and
she
wished
to
make
heaven
more
homelike
she
did
have
an
influence
in
her
day
as
may
be
illustrated
by
a
remark
from
a
sermon
recently
delivered
by
a
new
york
pastor
that
the
reading
of
her
books
had
exerted
a
great
influence
over
him
that
they
made
heaven
over
for
him
oliphant
is
another
of
the
conductors
of
fictive
cook
tours
through
heaven
and
hell
after
the
fashion
started
by
dante
and
milton
and
modernized
by
ward
she
devotes
volumes
to
describing
the
future
worlds
in
their
relation
to
mortal
destiny
one
story
tells
of
a
soul
that
comes
back
from
purgatory
to
be
comforted
by
the
old
minister
and
sent
away
happy
another
is
the
account
of
a
spirit
returning
from
heaven
to
right
a
wrong
that
her
husband
is
doing
another
still
another
gives
the
experiences
of
a
woman
who
is
distressed
when
she
finds
herself
in
heaven
because
she
has
hidden
her
will
and
her
young
niece
is
thereby
left
penniless
but
she
asks
advice
of
various
celestial
authorities
and
finally
succeeds
in
returning
to
earth
and
righting
matters
beleaguered
is
a
peculiar
story
of
a
french
town
besieged
by
the
dead
who
drive
out
the
inhabitants
because
of
their
cruelty
toward
some
nuns
a
strange
gloom
pervades
the
place
the
cathedral
bells
ring
of
themselves
and
flaming
signs
appear
on
the
church
doors
till
after
much
penance
the
citizens
are
allowed
to
return
and
the
invading
hosts
from
eternity
withdraw
in
one
story
oliphant
gives
her
ideas
of
heaven
as
a
place
of
light
of
rest
of
joy
of
service
where
the
great
angel
pain
helps
the
souls
to
wisdom
in
a
she
shows
hell
the
world
of
the
unhappy
dead
where
are
cruelty
selfishness
suffering
a
world
filled
with
tears
that
drip
from
earth
yet
it
is
a
hell
as
as
thoroughly
disciplined
as
a
german
municipality
with
various
punishments
the
most
terrible
being
a
lecture
platform
from
which
are
delivered
eternal
addresses
open
lady
little
pilgrim
in
the
land
of
these
stories
of
heaven
and
hell
somehow
leave
the
reader
cold
after
dante
and
milton
however
much
one
may
feel
the
sincerity
of
the
authors
heaven
and
hell
are
such
vast
provinces
that
one
can
not
chart
them
in
imagination
sufficiently
to
grasp
somebody
else
concept
in
story
other
stories
of
life
after
death
given
from
the
rather
than
from
the
mortal
point
of
view
as
in
most
ghost
stories
are
among
the
recent
types
of
supernaturalism
alice
brown
has
several
stories
of
the
kind
in
one
showing
a
woman
who
comes
to
tell
her
friend
not
to
be
afraid
of
dying
because
there
is
much
like
here
and
another
symbolic
of
the
power
of
love
to
come
back
even
from
the
pit
of
blackness
after
death
olivia
howard
dunbar
shell
of
gives
the
psychosis
of
a
woman
who
can
not
go
to
heaven
because
she
is
jealous
of
her
husband
she
the
form
of
the
wind
the
roses
open
in
the
garden
and
senses
many
things
unknown
to
human
beings
yet
is
actuated
by
very
human
motives
katherine
butler
suggests
that
death
must
be
a
painless
process
and
the
after
life
much
like
mortality
since
the
man
does
realize
that
he
is
dead
but
attempts
to
go
about
his
affairs
as
usual
in
no
strange
the
symbolic
treatment
of
the
theme
of
life
after
death
is
more
effective
and
shows
more
literary
art
than
the
conventional
pictures
of
ward
and
oliphant
no
human
vocabulary
is
able
to
describe
immortality
of
glory
or
despair
hence
it
is
more
effective
merely
to
suggest
the
thought
by
allegory
or
symbolism
hawthorne
gives
us
a
symbolic
morality
in
celestial
where
he
pictures
the
road
between
heaven
and
hell
drawing
on
bunyan
imagery
to
describe
the
landscape
and
characters
apollyon
is
engineer
and
emits
realistic
blasts
of
smoke
eugene
field
tells
of
a
mother
just
entering
heaven
who
asks
an
angel
where
she
may
find
her
little
baby
dead
long
ago
to
whom
the
angel
whispers
that
she
is
the
babe
grown
to
maturity
in
paradise
julian
hawthorne
in
is
a
symbolic
picture
of
the
after
life
where
a
man
just
dead
goes
in
search
of
the
beloved
he
lost
long
before
he
sees
her
on
the
far
slope
of
a
heavenly
hill
but
before
he
can
reach
her
the
devil
appears
to
him
in
his
own
double
the
satan
of
mine
own
self
the
part
of
me
wherein
god
had
no
share
this
is
a
quite
modern
concept
of
diabolism
but
love
struggles
to
save
him
and
he
resists
his
evil
self
in
mother
in
by
anita
silvani
shows
lurid
pictures
of
the
world
to
come
in
the
inferno
of
the
dark
star
the
soul
sees
the
attendant
genii
of
his
life
each
symbolizing
some
passion
of
his
nature
there
are
horrible
astral
birds
and
beasts
and
combinations
unknown
to
mortal
biology
while
vultures
hover
overhead
and
a
foul
astral
odor
fills
the
air
the
spirits
are
of
peculiar
substance
for
they
fight
and
slay
each
other
some
being
torn
to
pieces
the
soul
is
supposed
to
progress
toward
the
silver
and
later
the
golden
star
marie
of
two
is
a
queer
production
preaching
the
doctrine
of
psychical
electricity
which
is
to
be
a
sort
of
magician
and
in
other
novels
she
gives
theories
of
a
theosophical
for
this
world
and
the
next
vision
of
by
wells
is
a
satire
on
man
judgment
of
sin
and
character
and
of
destiny
after
death
showing
the
pettiness
and
folly
of
ahab
proud
of
his
sins
and
the
hypocrisy
of
a
saint
conceited
over
his
at
last
the
two
sat
side
by
side
stark
of
all
illusions
in
the
shadow
of
the
robe
of
charity
like
brothers
the
picture
of
god
and
the
throne
vanish
and
they
behold
a
land
austere
and
beautiful
with
the
enlightened
souls
of
men
in
clean
bodies
all
about
him
this
symbolic
allegory
setting
forth
the
shallowness
of
human
judgment
as
set
against
clarity
of
vision
and
charity
of
wisdom
is
like
oscar
wilde
house
of
a
terrible
piece
of
symbolism
expressed
in
a
few
words
a
soul
who
has
been
altogether
evil
comes
at
last
before
god
to
be
judged
god
speaks
to
him
of
his
vileness
his
cruelty
his
selfishness
to
all
of
which
the
soul
makes
confession
of
guilt
and
god
closing
the
book
of
the
man
life
said
surely
i
will
send
thee
into
hell
even
unto
hell
will
i
send
thee
and
the
man
cried
out
thou
canst
not
and
god
said
to
the
man
wherefore
can
i
not
send
thee
to
hell
and
for
what
reason
because
in
hell
i
have
always
lived
answered
the
man
and
there
was
silence
in
the
house
of
judgment
and
after
a
space
god
spake
and
said
to
the
man
seeing
that
i
may
not
send
thee
into
hell
i
will
send
thee
into
heaven
surely
unto
heaven
i
will
send
thee
and
the
man
cried
out
thou
canst
not
and
god
said
to
the
man
wherefore
can
i
not
send
thee
unto
heaven
and
for
what
reason
because
never
and
in
no
place
have
i
been
able
to
imagine
it
answered
the
man
and
there
was
silence
in
the
house
of
judgment
the
fact
that
a
man
thoughts
make
his
heaven
or
his
hell
is
brought
out
in
a
recent
book
case
of
john
by
elizabeth
bisland
where
the
central
character
receives
a
revelation
while
working
at
his
typewriter
one
day
the
message
says
oh
peevish
and
perverse
how
know
you
that
you
have
not
died
elsewhere
and
that
this
is
not
the
heaven
which
there
you
dreamed
how
know
you
that
your
hell
may
not
lie
only
in
not
recognizing
this
as
heaven
in
many
recent
examples
of
allegory
and
symbolism
we
get
suggestive
impressions
of
the
other
life
of
the
soul
realities
some
of
these
have
the
inevitable
words
the
fatal
phrases
that
seem
to
penetrate
into
the
real
heaven
and
hell
for
us
the
most
remarkable
instance
of
symbolic
treatment
of
the
is
in
on
by
granville
barker
where
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
represented
as
unable
to
rise
above
the
level
of
the
ideals
they
had
held
in
life
and
drift
endlessly
up
and
down
the
avenue
some
in
the
form
of
tarnished
gilt
some
with
white
plague
spots
of
cowardice
or
blisters
of
slanderous
thoughts
some
horny
with
selfishness
some
with
lines
of
secret
cruelty
there
are
few
squares
but
mostly
irregular
shapes
of
sin
the
purely
humorous
treatment
of
life
after
death
the
comic
pictures
of
heaven
and
hell
are
of
a
piece
with
the
humorous
treatment
of
other
phases
of
supernaturalism
and
are
distinctly
modern
the
flippant
way
in
which
sacred
subjects
are
handled
is
a
far
cry
from
the
heaven
and
hell
of
dante
and
milton
modern
writers
slap
the
devil
on
the
back
make
fun
of
the
archangels
and
appeal
to
the
ridiculous
in
sacred
situations
with
a
freedom
that
would
have
made
the
puritans
gasp
for
instance
peter
has
been
the
butt
of
so
many
jokes
that

hackneyed

to
face
and
he
knelt
in
that
holy
place
you
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
this
combination
of
realism
with
idealism
of
homely
details
with
celestial
symbolism
is
also
seen
in
another
recent
poem
man
with
the
by
william
rose
benet
who
shows
us
two
pictures
the
first
of
a
tramp
in
madison
square
garden
who
loves
the
pigeons
and
has
them
ever
clustering
around
him
in
devotion
the
next
is
of
heaven
with
the
celestial
gardens
where
among
the
goldhaired
angels
the
old
tramp
stands
at
home
still
wearing
his
rusty
shoes
and
battered
derby
hat
the
quaint
commingling
of
fancy
and
fact
reminds
us
of
dreams
of
heaven
in
hauptmann
where
the
schoolmaster
is
confused
with
the
angels
and
heaven
and
the
sordid
little
room
are
somehow
united
wells
in
wonderful
shows
us
another
side
of
the
picture
for
he
draws
an
angel
down
and
lets
him
tell
the
citizens
of
the
earth
of
the
land
he
comes
from
i
make
no
attempt
in
this
discussion
to
decide
concerning
the
personality
of
angels
whether
they
are
the
spirits
of
the
just
made
perfect
or
creatures
that
never
were
and
never
could
be
man
for
the
present
purpose
they
are
simply
angels
this
book
of
wells
is
an
example
of
the
satiric
treatment
of
heaven
and
earth
that
constitutes
a
special
point
of
importance
in
the
modern
supernaturalism
it
is
a
social
satire
and
a
burlesque
on
the
formal
and
insincere
manifestations
of
religion
a
vicar
takes
a
pot
shot
at
what
he
supposes
is
a
rare
bird
seeing
a
rainbow
flash
in
the
sky
but
instead
an
angel
comes
tumbling
down
with
a
broken
wing
this
thrusts
him
upon
the
vicar
as
a
guest
for
some
time
and
introduces
complications
in
the
village
life
the
parishioners
do
not
believe
in
angels
save
in
stained
glass
windows
or
in
church
on
sunday
and
they
make
life
difficult
for
the
vicar
and
his
guest
the
angel
shows
a
human
sense
of
humor
that
quaint
philosophy
of
the
incongruous
which
is
the
basis
of
all
true
humor
and
his
naïve
comments
on
earthly
conventions
his
smiling
wonder
at
the
popular
misconceptions
in
regard
to
his
heaven
to
which
he
is
surprised
to
learn
that
mortals
are
thought
to
go
since
he
says
he
has
never
seen
any
there
make
him
a
lovable
character
but
village
custom
compels
him
to
fold
his
shining
wings
under
a
coat
till
he
looks
like
a
put
boots
on
so
that
he
has
hoofs
like
a
hippogrif
as
he
plaintively
says
to
the
vicar
and
he
finds
conformity
to
convention
a
painful
process
the
novel
ends
sadly
symbolizing
the
world
stupid
harshness
for
the
angel
is
sent
away
from
the
village
as
unworthy
to
live
among
the
people
and
his
heart
is
almost
broken
the
same
type
of
humor
and
satire
may
be
found
in
james
and
in
anatole
france
revolt
of
the
stephens
novel
contains
an
insert
of
a
short
story
of
heaven
previously
published
which
depicts
a
preliminary
skirmish
in
heaven
over
a
coin
a
corpse
has
had
left
in
his
hand
and
has
taken
to
eternity
with
him
in
each
novel
several
angels
come
tumbling
down
from
heaven
and
take
up
earthly
life
as
they
find
it
engaging
in
affairs
not
considered
angelic
stephens
in
addition
to
the
two
fighting
celestials
gives
us
an
archangel
a
seraph
and
a
cherub
there
is
in
both
stories
a
certain
embarrassment
over
clothes
the
fallen
ones
arriving
in
a
state
of
nudity
the
necessity
for
donning
earthly
garments
the
removal
of
the
wings
and
the
adaptation
to
human
life
furnish
complication
and
interest
with
the
added
feminine
element
though
stephens
novel
is
not
marred
by
the
unclean
imaginings
of
anatole
france
the
revolters
in
the
french
novel
take
up
parisian
life
while
stephens
angelic
trio
join
an
itinerant
tinker
and
his
daughter
who
are
journeying
aimlessly
about
accompanied
by
a
cart
and
a
philosopher
an
ass
they
engage
in
activities
and
joys
not
conventionally
archangelic
such
as
smoking
pipes
eating
cold
potatoes
and
when
necessary
stealing
the
potatoes
the
contrasts
between
heavenly
ideas
and
irish
tramp
life
are
inimitable
at
last
when
the
three
having
decided
to
go
back
to
heaven
don
their
wings
and
crowns
and
say
the
cherub
turns
back
for
one
more
word
of
farewell
with
mary
seeing
her
tears
over
his
going
he
tears
his
shining
wings
to
shreds
and
casts
them
from
him
electing
to
stay
on
earth
with
the
tinker
cart
for
the
sake
of
love
it
is
really
quite
a
thing
to
do
unlike
france
book
which
is
a
blasting
satire
on
religion
these
two
english
novels
are
amusing
with
a
certain
measure
of
satire
yet
with
a
whimsicality
that
does
not
antagonize
france
angels
remain
on
earth
and
become
more
corrupt
than

and
wells
wonderful
visitor
is
banished

an
undesirable
alien
archangel
and

go
back
to
heaven
after
their
vacation
while
the
cherub
turns
his
back
on
immortal
glory
rather
than
break
a
woman
heart
in
all
three
of
these
books
we
notice
the
same
leveling
tendency
shown
in
characterization
of
the
angels
that
we
have
observed
heretofore
in
the
case
of
ghosts
and
devils
werewolves
and
witches
the
angels
are
human
with
charming
personality
and
a
piquant
sense
of
humor
whose
attempts
to
understand
mortal
conventions
reveal
the
essential
absurdity
of
earthly
ideas
in
many
instances
the
three
taken
together
constitute
an
interesting
case
of
literary
parallelism
and
it
would
be
gratifying
to
discover
whether
france
was
influenced
by
wells
and
stephens
or
stephens
by
wells
and
france
but
in
any
event
wells
can
prove
a
clear
alibi
as
to
imitation
since
his
novel
appeared
a
number
of
years
before
the
others
the
possible
inspiration
for
all
of
these
in
byron
and
suggests
an
interesting
investigation
a
more
recent
story
brings
an
angel
down
to
a
new
york
apartment
where
he
has
peculiar
experiences
and
illustrates
a
new
type
of
angelic
psychology
the
tendency
to
satirize
immortality
has
crept
even
into
poetry
for
in
a
recent
volume
by
rupert
brooke
there
are
several
satiric
studies
one
entitled
certain
proceedings
of
the
psychical
research
ridicules
the
idea
that
spirits
would
return
to
earth
to
deliver
the
trivial
messages
attributed
to
them
and
another
is
a
vitriolic
thrust
at
the
hope
of
a
better
life
after
death
sneering
at
it
with
unpleasant
imagery
one
of
the
recent
instances
of
satiric
pictures
of
the
hereafter
is
lord
dunsany
glittering
a
drama
where
bill
and
jim
two
burglars
crack
the
gate
of
heaven
to
get
in
sardonic
laughter
sounds
while
they
are
engaged
in
the
effort
to
effect
an
entrance
and
wondering
what
heaven
will
be
like
bill
thinks
that
his
mother
will
be
there
i
do
know
if
they
want
a
good
mother
in
there
who
would
be
kind
to
the
angels
and
sit
and
smile
at
them
when
they
sing
and
soothe
them
if
they
were
cross
suddenly
jim
they
wo
have
brought
me
up
against
her
will
they
jim
it
would
be
just
like
them
to
very
like
them
when
the
glittering
gate
of
heaven
swings
open
and
the
two
toughs
enter
eagerly
they
find
nothing
absolutely
nothing
but
empty
space
and
the
sardonic
laughter
sounds
in
their
ears
bill
cries
out
it
is
just
like
them
very
like
them
was
not
this
suggested
by
rupert
brooke
poem
in
the
stories
treating
satirically
or
humorously
of
the
future
life
we
find
the
purpose
in
reality
to
be
to
image
this
life
by
illustration
of
the
other
eternity
is
described
in
order
that
we
may
understand
time
a
little
better
angels
and
devils
are
made
like
men
to
show
mortal
potentialities
either
way
the
absurdities
of
mankind
are
illustrated
as
seen
by
angel
eyes
the
follies
as
satirized
by
devils
the
tendency
now
is
to
treat
supernatural
life
humorously
satirically
or
symbolically
rather
than
with
the
conventional
methods
of
the
past
commonplace
treatment
of
great
subjects
is
liable
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
any
serious
treatment
other
than
symbolically
simple
of
heaven
or
hell
seems
flat
after
dante
and
milton
in
considering
these
various
types
of
stories
dealing
with
supernatural
life
whether
continued
beyond
the
mortal
span
on
earth
renewed
by
reincarnation
or
taken
up
in
another
world
after
death
we
find
that
several
facts
seem
to
appear
with
reference
to
the
type
chosen
for
treatment
by
men
as
distinct
from
women
and
so
far
as
my
search
has
gone
i
have
found
no
instance
in
english
literature
where
a
woman
has
used
either
the
motif
of
the
wandering
jew
or
the
elixir
of
life
i
do
not
say
that
no
such
instances
exist
but
i
have
not
found
them
carmen
sylva
is
the
only
woman
i
know
of
at
all
who
has
taken
up
the
characterization
of
the
wandering
jew
on
the
other
hand
women
write
often
of
heaven
most
of
the
stories
of
conventional
ideas
of
heaven
being
by
women
where
men
have
pictured
heaven
or
hell
they
have
done
it
for
the
most
part
humorously
satirically
or
symbolically
they
seem
to
curve
round
the
subject
rather
than
to
approach
it
directly
yet
where
it
is
a
question
of
continuing
life
here
in
this
world
by
means
of
an
elixir
or
other
method
or
as
an
being
like
the
jew
men
have
used
the
theme
frequently
since
fiction
does
reflect
our
and
our
individual
as
well
as
racial
preferences
the
conclusions
that
might
be
drawn
if
one
were
sure
of
their
basis
would
be
interesting
can
it
be
that
men
are
more
deeply
interested
in
this
life
on
earth
and
cling
to
it
in
thought
more
tenaciously
than
women
and
that
women
are
more
truly
citizens
of
the
other
world
are
men
skeptical
of
the
existence
of
any
but
a
satiric
or
symbolic
heaven
or
merely
doubtful
of
reaching
there
chapter
vi
the
supernatural
in
the
is
one
of
the
new
fashions
in
fiction
true
has
long
constituted
an
important
element
of
literature
constantly
recurring
in
poetry
particularly
in
the
ballad
in
the
drama
the
novel
and
short
story
yet
it
has
been
in
solution
it
has
not
been
thought
important
enough
to
merit
consideration
for
its
own
sake
but
has
been
rather
apologized
for
covered
up
with
other
materials
so
that
its
presence
is
scarcely
recognized
now
however
as
professor
kittredge
says
is
no
longer
on
the
defensive
which
fact
is
evident
in
fiction
as
elsewhere
scholars
of
our
day
are
eagerly
hunting
down
the
various
forms
of
to
preserve
them
in
literature
before
they
vanish
completely
and
learned
societies
are
recording
with
care
the
myths
and
legends
and
superstitions
of
peasants
many
volumes
have
appeared
giving
in
literary
form
the
fictions
of
various
races
and
tribes
and
comparative
is
found
to
be
an
engrossing
science
the
supernatural
forms
a
large
element
of
the
traditions
and
stories
that
come
down
to
us
from
the
childhood
of
any
race
are
like
the
stories
that
children
delight
in
tales
of
the
marvelous
of
the
impossible
of
magic
and
wonder
recks
little
of
realism
it
revels
in
the
romantic
the
mystic
tales
of
gods
and
of
giants
and
demons
of
of
animals
endowed
with
human
powers
of
speech
and
cunning
of
supernatural
flora
as
well
as
fauna
of
ghosts
devils
of
saints
and
miracles
are
the
of
such
fiction
english
literature
is
especially
rich
in
these
collections
for
not
only
are
the
sections
of
countries
themselves
fortunate
fields
for
supernatural
but
the
english
being
a
race
of
colonizers
have
gone
far
in
many
lands
and
from
the
distant
corners
of
the
earth
have
written
down
the
legends
of
many
tribes
and
nations
this
discussion
does
not
take
into
consideration
primarily
translated
from
other
languages
but
deals
only
with
those
appearing
in
english
though
of
course
in
many
cases
they
are
transcripts
from
the
spoken
dialects
of
other
people
but
it
is
for
their
appearance
as
english
fiction
not
for
their
value
as
that
they
are
taken
up
here
wherever
in
fiction
the
life
of
the
peasant
class
is
definitely
treated
there
is
likely
to
be
found
a
good
deal
of
in
the
form
of
superstitions
taboos
racial
traditions
of
the
supernatural
this
is
present
to
a
marked
degree
in
the
stories
of
sir
walter
scott
and
in
fact
one
might
write
a
volume
on
the
supernatural
in
work

we
have

magic
and
wonder

so

by

he

a
large
admixture
of
the
of
the
dartmoor
peasants
as

and
numberless
other

sections
there
are

so
on

american
fiction
is
equally
rich
in
such
material

reveal
it
to

of

in
most
fiction
that
represents
truly
the
life
of
simple
people
there
will
be
found
a
certain
amount
of
superstition
which
is
inherent
in
practically
every
soul
there
is
no
one
of
us
but
has
his
ideas
of
fate
of
luck
of
taboo
we
are
so
used
to
these
elements
in
life
that
we
scarcely
pay
heed
to
them
in
fiction
yet
a
brief
glance
at
books
will
recall
their
frequent
appearance
they
color
poetry
to
a
marked
degree
in
fact
without
the
sense
of
the
marvelous
the
unreal
the
wonderful
the
magical
what
would
poetry
mean
to
us
so
we
should
feel
a
keen
loss
in
our
fiction
if
all
the
vague
elements
of
the
supernatural
were
effaced
absolute
realism
is
the
last
thing
we
desire
now
the
told
frankly
as
such
with
no
apology
for
its
unreality
no
attempt
to
make
of
it
merely
an
allegory
or
vehicle
for
teaching
moral
truth
has
taken
its
place
in
our
literature
the
science
of
ethnology
has
brought
a
wider
interest
in
the
oral
heritage
of
the
past
linking
it
to
our
life
of
the
present
and
the
multiplication
of
volumes
recording
stories
of
symbolic
phenomena
of
nature
of
gods
and
heroes
of
supernormal
animals
and
plants
of
fairies
banshees
bogles
giants
saints
miracles
and
make
it
possible
to
compare
the
widely
disseminated
stories
the
variants
and
contrasting
types
of
but
my
purpose
in
this
discussion
is
to
show
the
presence
of
the
in
literature
in
prose
fiction
particularly
there
is
no
science
more
fascinating
than
comparative
and
no
language
affords
so
many
original
examples
of
oral
literature
as
the
english
as
we
study
its
influence
on
fiction
and
poetry
we
feel
the
truth
of
what
tylor
says
little
by
little
in
what
seems
the
most
spontaneous
fiction
a
more
comprehensive
study
of
the
sources
of
poetry
and
romance
begins
to
disclose
a
cause
for
each
fancy
a
story
of
inherited
materials
from
which
each
province
of
the
poet
land
has
been
shaped
and
built
over
and
peopled
in
vol
page
the
celtic
revival
the
renascence
of
wonder
in
ireland
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
awaken
modern
love
for
antiquity
to
bring
over
into
literature
the
legends
of
gods
and
men
beyond
the
misty
space
of
twice
a
thousand
years
while
the
movement
concerns
itself
more
with
poetry
and
the
drama
than
with
prose
ireland
has
been
likened
to
a
nest
of
singing
birds
though
the
voices
of
some
have
been
sadly
silenced
of
late
yet
fiction
has
felt
its
influence
as
well
the
land
of
the
immortals
glooms
and
gleams
again
for
us
in
storied
vision
and
the
ancient
past
yields
up
to
us
its
magic
its
laughter
its
tears
these
romances
are
written
not
in
pedestrian
prose
as
ordinary
but
with
a
bardic
beauty
that
gives
to
style
the
lifting
wings
of
verse
each
fact
and
figure
is
expressed
in
poetic
symbols
which
yeats
calls
streams
of
passion
poured
about
concrete
forms
a
sense
of
ancient
divine
powers
is
in
every
bush
and
bog
every
lake
and
valley
ireland
has
enriched
universal
fancy
and
the
effect
on
literature
will
perhaps
never
be
lost
one
of
the
most
interesting
aspects
of
supernaturalism
is
that
concerned
with
nature
the
primitive
mind
needs
no
scientific
proof
for
theories
of
causation
since
given
a
belief
in
gods
it
can
manage
the
rest
for
itself
with
the
celts
there
is
ever
a
feeling
of
nature
as
a
mighty
personality
every
aspect
every
phase
of
her
power
is
endowed
with
life
and
temperament
celtic
pantheism
saw
in
every
form
a
spirit
in
every
spring
or
cloud
or
in
every
bird
or
blossom
some
unearthly
divinity
of
being
a
primrose
is
vastly
more
than
a
yellow
primrose
but
one
of
the
dear
golden
folk
the
hawthorn
is
the
barking
of
hounds
leek
is
the
tear
of
a
fair
woman
and
so
on
which
poetic
speech
bears
a
likeness
to
the
icelandic
court
poetry
this
figurative
sense
suggests
an
of
the
old
lingering
yet
about
the
fjords
and
glens
where
druidism
never
was
quite
overcome
by
christianity
it
lends
to
the
celtic
their
wild
unearthly
beauty
their
passionate
poetry
and
mystic
symbolism
akin
to
the
classic
mythology
and
such
as
we
find
in
no
other
of
the
present
time
in
the
stories
of
lady
gregory
john
synge
yeats
lady
wilde
and
various
other
chroniclers
of
celtic
legendry
we
find
explanations
of
many
phenomena
accounts
of
diverse
occurrences
lady
wilde
speranza
tells
of
natural
appearances
such
as
a
great
chasm
which
was
opened
to
swallow
a
man
who
incurred
the
anger
of
god
by
challenging
him
to
combat
for
destroying
his
crops
a
supernatural
whirlwind
caught
up
the
blasphemer
and
hurled
him
into
the
chasm
that
yawned
to
receive
him
many
of
the
aspects
of
nature
are
attributed
to
the
activities
of
giants
and
later
of
demons
as
the
piling
up
of
cyclopean
walls
massive
of
earth
or
gigantic
masses
of
rocks
said
to
be
the
work
of
playful
or
irate
giants
the
titans
were
frolicsome
and
delighted
in
feats
to
show
off
there
is
a
large
body
of
legends
of
diabolized
nature
as
the
changing
of
the
landscape
by
demons
the
sulphurizing
of
springs
and
the
cursing
of
localities
in
legends
and
superstitions
of
many
other
aspects
of
nature
are
made
the
basis
for
supernatural
too
numerous
to
mention
stories
of
the
enchanted
bird
music
and
water
appear
in
various
forms
and
the
of
the
cornish
country
tell
many
stories
of
the
weird
associated
with
the
celtic
superstitions
and
tales
have
lived
on
through
successive
invasions
and
through
many
centuries
have
been
told
beside
the
peat
fire
they
have
been
preserved
as
an
oral
heritage
or
else
in
almost
illegible
manuscripts
in
antique
libraries
from
which
they
are
taken
to
be
put
into
literature
by
the
celtic
patriots
of
letters
the
sense
of
terror
and
of
awe
a
belief
in
the
darker
powers
as
well
as
an
feeling
of
beauty
is
a
heritage
of
the
celtic
mind
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
obstinacy
of
these
pantheistic
druidic
stories
in
the
face
of
irish
catholicism
in
many
other
bodies
of
in
english
we
have
similar
legends
of
nature
as
in
the
hawaiian
the
indian
african
canadian
mexican
stories
and
elsewhere
but
the
material
is
so
voluminous
that
one
can
do
no
more
than
suggest
the
field
certain
forces
of
nature
are
given
supernatural
power
in
drama
and
fiction
as
the
sea
that
is
an
awful
brooding
fate
in
drama
or
the
wind
and
the
flame
in
algernon
blackwood
story
regeneration
of
lord
or
the
goblin
trees
in
another
of
his
tales
that
signify
diabolic
spirits
or
the
trees
that
have
a
strange
compelling
power
over
men
drawing
them
going
out
bodily
to
meet
them
luring
them
to
destruction
blackwood
has
stressed
this
form
of
supernaturalism
to
a
marked
degree
in
he
shows
desert
incantations
that
embody
majestic
forces
evocations
of
ancient
deities
that
bring
the
sphynx
to
life
and
other
sinister
powers
he
takes
the
aspects
of
nature
and
makes
them
live
personifying
the
forces
of
life
as
mythology
did
the
trees
the
sand
the
fire
the
snow
the
wind
the
stream
the
sea
are
all
alive
with
personality
with
emotion
and
definite
being
his
trees
are
more
awesome
than
the
woods
of
dunsinane
for
they
actually
do
move
upon
their
foe
in
sea
he
contends
that
the
gods
are
not
dead
but
merely
withdrawn
that
one
true
worshiper
can
call
them
back
to
earth
especially
the
the
sea
comes
in
power
for
the
man
with
the
viking
soul
and
takes
him
to
itself
his
going
is
symbolic
uttering
the
singing
sound
of
falling
waters
he
bent
forward
turned
the
next
instant
curving
over
like
a
falling
wave
he
swept
along
the
glistening
surface
of
the
sands
and
was
gone
in
fluid
form
his
being
slipped
away
into
the
being
of
the
sea
in
man
whom
the
trees
the
uncanny
potentialities
of
fire
are
revealed
where
the
internal
flame
breaks
out
of
itself
the
inner
fire
that
burns
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
and
in
men
hearts
the
artist
trying
to
paint
a
great
picture
of
the

consumed
by
an
intense
rapturous
fever
and
as
he
dies
his
face
is
like
a
white
flame
the
snow
appears
embodied
as
a
luring
woman
she
tries
to
draw
a
man
to
his
death
with
dæmonic
charm
seen
as
a
lovely
woman
but
a
snow
demon
blackwood
shows
the
curious
combination
of
the
soul
of
a
dead
woman
with
the
spirit
of
a
place
where
a
man
is
ejected
by
his
own
estate
turned
out
bodily
as
well
as
psychically

he

august
stramm
the
german
dramatist
has
given
an
uncanny
force
to
the
moor
in

of
his

making
it
the

character
as
well
as
the

this

fables

reynard

the
german
reinecke
fuchs
all
show
how
fond
humanity
is
of
the
story
that
endows
animals
with
human

naturally
one
thinks
of
kipling
and
joel
chandler
harris
stories
as
the
best
modern
examples
and
these
are
so
well
known
as
to
need
but
mention
similar
are
found
in
the
of
other
countries
of
course
it
is
understood
that
the
stories
are
not
native
to
america
but
were
brought
from
africa
by
the
slaves
and
handed
down
through
generations
in
the
form
in
which
harris
heard
them
by
the
cabin
firesides
in
his
boyhood
they
are
not
cooked
or
edited
any
more
than
he
could
help
he
tells
us
but
given
in
the
dialectic
form
in
which
they
came
to
him
there
are
various
tales
similar
to
this

as
kaffir

brought
together
by
charles
hart
and
the
fox

by
bleek
powell
in
his
investigations
for
the
smithsonian
institute
found
legends
among
the
indians
that
led
him
to
believe
the

were
originally
learned
from
the
red
men
but
harris

there
was
no

a

old

like
a
scandinavian
troll
or
english
who
plays
tricks
like
those
of
the
fox
and
like
the
jackal
in
hindu
stories
he
is
a
spider
as
well
as
a
man
and
can
assume
either
shape
at
will
in
primitive
races
and
in
the
childhood
of
peoples
there
is
the
same
element
of
close
association
between
man
and
the
animals
that
one
finds
in
an
animal
is
often
nearer
and
dearer
to
a
child
than
is
a
human
being
as
in
crude
races
man
is
more
like
the
animals
candid
careless
unreflecting
his
sensations
and
emotions

hunger
love

animals
in

are
lifted
nearer
the

in

thinking
and
are
given
human
attributes
in
which
bridges
the
gulf
that
civilization
has
tended
to
fix
between
man
and
animals
and
gives
one
more
of
a
sense
of
the
social
union
that
burns
longed
for
there
is
in
these
stories
of
whatever
country
a
naïveté
reflecting
the
childhood
of
the
race
and
of
the
world
a
primitive
simplicity
in
dealing
with
the
supernatural
the
of
each
country
gives
stories
of
the
animals
common
to
that
section
in
tropic
countries
we
have
stories
of
supernatural
snakes
who
appear
in
various
forms
as
shall
we
say
by
turns
reptiles
and
men
who
marry
mortal
women
or
as
diabolic
creatures
that
like
the
devil
lose
their
divinity
and
become
evil
powers
we
also
see
in
the
tropics
elephants
lions
tigers
baboons
gorillas
and
so
forth
as
well
as
certain
insects
while
in
colder
climes
we
have
the
fox
the
wolf
the
bear
and
their
confrères
in
island
countries
we
find
a
large
element
of
the
supernatural
associated
with
fishes
and
hawaiian

recount
adventures
of
magic
beings
born
of
sharks
and

who
are
themselves
by

human

several

are
drawn
from

the
gaelic

the

the

we
must
not
forget
the
gladsome
beast
he
who
dwells
underneath
fairyland
at
the
edge
of

the
beast
that
eats
men
and
destroys
the

the

looks
after
fairyland

is
the
synonym
for
joy
his
joyous
chuckles

sings
of
the
malignity

when
the
gladsome

weeps
great

there
are

silence
is
unearthly
like
the
touch
of
a
ghoul
over
which
is
a
look
in
the
sky
that
is
worse
than
a
spoken
doom
that
watch

through

to
carry
him
into

ancient
lands
to
show
us
the
wonders
that
never
were
magic
forms
an
alluring
element
of
the
supernatural
romance
and
we
find
it
manifesting
itself
in
many
ways
in
the
romances
of
william
morris
prose
as
well
as
poetry
we
find
enchantment
recurring
again
and
again
as
in
water
of
the
wondrous
wood
beyond
the
well
at
the
world
and
others
yeats
said
that
morris
style
in
these
old
stories
was
the
most
beautiful
prose
he
had
ever
read
and
that
it
influenced
his
own
work
greatly
he
has
unearthly
characters
such
as
the
the
the
stony
people
and
so
forth
he
shows
us
the
enchanted
boat
the
sending
boat
the
cage
with
the
golden
bars
which
prison
the
three
maidens
magic
runes
with
mighty

the

the
wailing

so
forth

in
the
white
palace
is
unearthly
as
the
witches
wordless
howls
part
of
the
weirdness
of
morris
prose
is
due
to
the
antique
tone
the
forgotten
words
the
quality
of
the
rhythm
yeats
tells
of
magic
whereby
a
woman
is
gifted
with
immortal
youth
and
beauty
so
that
she
may
wed
the
prince
of
the
fairies
of
the
glamour
that
falls
on
a
mortal
so
that
he
loses
his
wits
and
remains
with
his
head
on
his
knees
by
the
fire
to
the
day
of
his
death
of
shadow
hares
of
hounds
that
follow
the
lost
soul
across
the

lady
gregory
tells
of
diarmuid
where
youth
touched
him
on
the
forehead
so
that
no
woman
could
look
upon
him
without
giving
him
her
love
of
miach
who
put
the
eye
of
a
cat
in
a
man
head
with
inconvenient
results
for
when
he
wanted
to
sleep
and
take
his
rest
it
is
then
the
eye
would
start
at
the
squeaking
of
the
mice
or
the
flight
of
birds
or
the
movement
of
the
rushes
and
when
he
was
wanting
to
watch
an
army
or
a
gathering
it
is
then
it
was
sure
to
be
in
a
sound
sleep
she
shows
us
druid
rods
that
change
mortals
into
birds
of
druid
mists
that
envelop
armies
and
let
the
ancient
heroes
win
of

sleep
that
lasts
sometimes
for
years
of
the
screaming
stone
of
kisses
that
turn
into
birds
some
of
them
saying
come
come
and
others
i
go
i
go
of
invisible
walls
that
shield
one
from
sight
of
magic
that
makes
armies
from
stalks
of
grass
of
wells
of
healing
that
cure
every
wound
oscar
wilde
in
his
fairy
stories
and
symbolic
allegories
tells
of
magic
whereby
the
happy
prince
high
on
the
pedestal
on
the
square
has
a
heart
of
lead
because
he
sees
the
misery
of
the
people
and
sends
a
swallow
as
his
messenger
to
pick
out
his
jeweled
eyes
and
take
them
to
the
suffering
ones
he
speaks
of
the
wonder
by
which
the
bodies
of
the
mermaid
and
the
fisherman
who
lost
his
soul
for
love
of
her
when
they
are
buried
in
unconsecrated
ground
send
forth
strange
flowers
that
are
placed
on
the
sacred
altar
the
dark
enchantment
appears
in
the
poetry
as
often
as
in
the
prose
from
coleridge
to
the
present
gordon
bottomley
crier
by
is
a
story
of
an
evil
presence
that
lurks
in
a
pool
coming
out
to
steal
the
souls
of
those
it
can
lure
into
its
waters
the
woman
desperate
from
jealousy
who
invokes
its
aid
says
for
i
can
use
this
body
worn
to
a
soul
to
barter
with
the
crier
of
hidden
things
that
if
he
tangle
him
in
his
chill
hair
then
i
will
follow
and
follow
and
follow
and
follow
past
where
the
ringed
stars
ebb
past
the
light
and
turn
to
water
under
the
dark
world
the
fairy
has
always
been
a
favorite
being
with
poets
dramatists
and
romancers
from
shakespeare
spenser
and
milton
to
the
present
time
there
is
no
figure
more
firmly
established
in
none
more
difficult
to
dislodge
despite
their
delicacy
and
ethereal
qualities
than
the
little
people
the
belief
in
fairies
is
firmly
established
in
sections
and
the
celtic
peasant
would
as
soon
give
up
his
religion
as
his
belief
in
the
sidhe
yeats
in
tells
of
an
irish
woman
of
daring
unbelief
in
hell
or
in
ghosts
who
she
held
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
trapsin
about
the
earth
at
their
own
free
will
but
who
asserted
there
are
fairies
and
little
leprechauns
and
and
fallen
angels
everybody
among
the
peasantry
believes
in
fairies
for
they
stand
to
reason
and
there
are
not
wanting
others
more
learned
that
believe
in
the
small
folk
as
wentz
who
in
his
volume
faith
in
celtic
puts
up
a
loyal
argument
for
the
existence
of
the
sidhe
he
says
fairies
exist
because
in
all
essentials
they
appear
to
be
the
same
as
the
intelligent
forces
now
recognized
by
psychological
researchers
be
they
thus
collective
units
of
consciousness
like
what
william
james
calls
or
more
individual
units
like
veridical
apparitions
if
it
were
left
to
me
i
as
soon
not
believe
in
fairies
as
have
to
think
of
them
as
veridical
units
wentz
has
never
seen
any
fairies
himself
but
he
tells
a
number
of
stories
to
substantiate
his
faith
in
them
the
volumes
of
fairy
stories
are
by
no
means
all
for
juvenile
consumption
since
the
modern
adult
dearly
loves
the
type
himself
many
or
most
of
the
stories
of
fairies
told
frankly
for
children
are
adaptations
or
variants
of
continental
the
more
literary
side

from

dearest
of
all

more
innately
poetic
than

cling
more
fondly
to
the
beings
of

and
gather
round
them
delicate
undying
stories
yeats

oscar

john

fiona

have
given
in

everything

how

broke
into
a

a

us
the
wee
folk
in
kensington
gardens
where
by
the
ignorant
they
are
mistaken
for

children

those

can
see
the
flashing
faces
and
green
garments
of
the
fairies
among
the
pansy
beds
yeats

a

with

they
have
given
him
the
dower
of
magic
vision
to
glimpse
the
unseen

to
hear
the
faint
musical
voices
of

many
stories
of

between
the
divine
and
mortal
forces
and
the
powers
of
the
sidhe
to
claim
the
soul
of

of

while
her

speeds
away
to

yeats

of
fantastic
doings
of
the
who
steal
mortals
away
especially
babies

james

in

delightfully
with
other
elements
of
the
supernatural
as
talking

the

a

combining
with

to
make
a
charming
social
satire
the
union
of
the
world
of

with
that
of
the
wee
people
is
seen
in
the
sad
little
story
of

man
who
had
been
in
a
crude
materialistic
englishman
in
love
with
an
ordinary
young
woman
falls
asleep
on
a
fairy
knoll
one
night
and
is
kidnapped
by
the
dim
people
who
take
him
to
their
country
where
their
queen
falls
in
love
with
him
she
vainly
woos
him
but
he
is
stolidly
true
to
the
girl
of
the
town
until
the
fairies
send
him
back
in
sleep
to
mortal
life
but
when
he
wakes
on
the
knoll
he
is
for
fairyland
he
cares
no
more
for
the
village
girl
who
seems
coarse
and
repulsive
compared
with
the
elfin
creature
whose
love
he
might
have
kept
in
the
land
of
wonder
so
he
is
wretched
unable
to
fit
again
into
mortal
life
and
unable
to
reopen
the
doors
that
closed
inexorably
upon
him
by
his
wish
this
is
a
modern
version
of
the
motif
of
the
mortal
lover
and
the
fairy
bride
that
we
find
so
often
in
mediæval
ballads
and
romances
a
survival
of

celtic
arthur
lewis

writes
philosophic
human
stories
in
the
guise
of
fairy
tales
attempting
frankly
to
bring
the
impossible
into
contact
with
daily
life
they
are
weird
little

with
an
earthly

as
the

by

of
her

whether
fairyland
be
an
actual
place
or
a
state

it
is
a
province
still
open
to
romancers
and
folklorists
have
aroused
a
new
interest
in
the
little
people
who
may
come
nearer
to
us
than
before
the
flood
of
volumes
recounting
celtic
with
their
alone
would
make
a
long
catalogue
and
one
can
do
no
more
than
suggest
the
presence
of
the
fairy
in
english
fiction
andrew
lang
was
a
faithful
lover
of
the
sidhe
and
made
many
collections
of
fairy
stories
eden
phillpotts
has
written
much
of
them
and
various
writers
have
opened
their
magic
to
us
some
place
the
land
of
faerie
under
the
ground
some
in
secret
caves
some
in
the
mind
and
lord
dunsany
says
that
the
old
man
who
looks
after
fairyland
lives
in
a
house
whose
parlor
windows
look
away
from
the
world
and
empties
his
slops
sheer
on
to
the
southern
cross
we
find
many
stories
of
gods
demigods
and
heroes
tangled
up
together
in
and
in
the
literature
they
have
influenced
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
and
again
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
has
been
converted
into
the
tale
of
a
god
celtic
romances
and
give
many
stories
of
gods
demigods
and
heroes
of
superhuman
force
it
would
be
interesting
if
one
could
trace
them
to
their
ultimate
sources
and
discover
how
much
they
have
been
suggested
or
influenced
by
classical
mythology
in
of
the
irish
by
patrick
kennedy
are
numberless
stories
of
the
fianna
eironn
or
heroes
of
ireland
some
of
whom
really
flourished
in

whose
adventures
were
the

of

the
exploits
of

dating
back
to

reflect
the
remote
stages
of
the
legendary
history
of

nine
pipers
that
came
out

that

overcome

to
cover

king
who
raised
a
house
by
enchantment
and
whom
grania
of
the
fatal
beauty
loved
jeremiah
curtin
aldis
dunbar
and
many
another
writer
have
told
us
of
the
wonderful
legends
of
the
celtic
gods
and
heroes
who
somehow
seem
more
human
than
arthur
and
his
table
round
or
any
of
the
english
mythical
heroes
it
is
lord
dunsany
however
who
specializes
in
gods
in
recent
times
he
fairly
revels
in
divinities
and
demons
in
idols
and
creatures
his
dramas
of
this
nature
are
mentioned
in
another
connection
as
night
at
an
where
a
jade
idol
slays
with
silent
horror
the
men
who
have
stolen
his
emerald
eye
gods
of
the
where
seven
beggars
masquerade
as
the
mountain
gods
come
to
life
and
some
of
the
people
believe
but
some
doubt
but
at
last
the
seven
gods
from
the
mountain
come
down
terrible
figures
of
green
stone
and
with
sinister
menace
point
terrible
fingers
at
the
beggars
who
stiffen
as
on
pedestals
draw
their
feet
under
them
like
the
posture
of
the
images
and
turn
to
stone
so
that
the
people
coming
say
they
were
the
true
gods
they
have
turned
to
stone
because
we
doubted
them
in
gods
of
are
many
fantastic
tales
of
divinities
never
heard
of
before
whom
dunsany
calls
to
life
with
the
lavish
ease
of
genius
and
makes
immortal
in
and
the
we
see
many
gods
with
their
servant
the
swart
sinister
time
who
serves
them
but
maliciously
the
gods
dream
marble
dreams
that
have
magic
power
for
with
domes
and
pinnacles
the
dreams
arose
and
stood
up
proudly
between
the
river
and
the
sky
all
shimmering
white
to
the
morning
but
sardathrion
this
city
of
visions
is
overthrown
by
hateful
time
whereat
the
mighty
gods
weep
grievous
tears
he
tells
us
of
slid
a
new
god
that
comes
striding
through
the
stars
past
where
the
ancient
divinities
are
seated
on
their
thrones
as
a
million
waves
march
behind
him
of
inzana
the
daughter
of
all
the
gods
who
plays
with
the
sun
as
her
golden
ball
and
weeps
when
it
falls
into
the
sea
so
that
umborodom
with
his
thunder
hound
must
seek
it
again
and
again
for
her
he
whispers
to
us
of
the
prophet
who
saw
the
gods
one
night
as
they
strode
in
stars
and
above
them
a
mighty
hand
showing
a
higher
power
the
gods
are
jealous
of
him
that
he
has
seen
so
they
rob
him
of
knowledge
of
the
gods
of
moon
and
sky
of
butterflies
and
flowers
and
all
lovely
things
and
last
they
steal
his
soul
away
from
him
from
which
they
make
the
south
wind
forever
to
roam
the
waste
spaces
of
the
world
mournful
unremembering
in
book
of
are
still
other
gods
as
who
wears
the
haloes
of
other
gods
on
golden
hooks
along
his
the
sphinx
who
remembers
in
her
smitten
mind
at
which
little
boys
now
leer
that
she
once
knew
well
those
things
at
which
man
stands
aghast
the
certain
disreputable
god
who
knows
nothing
of
etiquette
and
will
grant
prayers
that
no
respectable
god
would
ever
consent
to
hear
and
sheemish
who
become
angry
with
each
other
and
raise
rival
earthquakes
that
destroy
their
temple
and
them
we
are
told
of
the
gibbelins
that
eat
men
whose
home
is
beyond
the
known
regions
and
whose
treasures
many
burglars
try
in
vain
to
steal
only
to
meet
death
instead
alderic
tries
a
crafty
way
to
evade
them
but
they
are
waiting
for
him
and
without
saying
a
word
even
they
neatly
hang
him
on
the
outer
wall
and
the
tale
is
one
of
those
that
have
not
a
happy
ending
but
enough
of
gods
though
we
should
not
forget
the
aztec
legend
on
which
lew
wallace
novel
fair
was
founded
of
the
white
divinity
who
was
to
come
and
rule
the
people
there
are
many
other
elements
of
folkloristic
supernaturalism
that
can
not
be
mentioned
as
the
banshee
the
wailful
creature
that
is
a
presager
of
death
and
the
loss
of
the
soul
the
fetches
ghosts
of
the
living
whom
john
and
michael
banim
write
much
about
the
pixies
as
appearing
in
such
works
as
and
stephens
crock
of
the
mountain
trolls
that
play
pranks
on
ibsen
peer
gynt
and
irving
rip
van
winkle
the
that
scott
tells
about
the
saints
and
miracles
that
abound
in
celtic
literature
as
in
that
of
any
catholic
country
and
such
as
thomas
janvier
has
told
of
so
delightfully
in
his
legends
of
the
city
of
mexico
the
giant
has
almost
faded
from
fiction
since
poor
thing
he
does
fit
in
well
with
the
modern
scheme
of
housing
he
came
into
the
gothic
novel
from
the
oriental
tale
where
he
had
his
origin
but
now
he
appears
in
our
fiction
only
sporadically
as
in
oscar
wilde
selfish
in
a
couple
of
stories
by
blackwood
and
a
few
others
we
are
glad
to
meet
him
occasionally
in
frank
since
literature
at
large
repudiates
this
favorite
of
our
youth
he
would
not
suit
well
on
the
stage
for
obvious
reasons
and
realism
rejects
him
lord
dunsany
tells
of
elves
and
gnomes
of
the
moomoo
of
the
magic
sword
called
mouse
of
the
gnoles
that
caught
tonker
of
the
ancient
thuls
of
the
window
that
opened
to
the
magic
of
the
world
and
of
many
other
things
which
only
the
very
young
or
the
very
wise
care
for
arthur
machen
deals
with
strange
sinister
aspects
of
supernaturalism
unlike
the
wholesome
folklore
that
other
writers
reveal
to
us
he
seems
to
take
his
material
chiefly
from
the
pit
to
let
loose
upon
the
world
a
slimy
horde
of
unnamable
spirits
of
ageless
evil
one
reads
of
the
white
people
who
are
most
loathsome
fairies
under
whose
influence
the
rocks
dance
obscene
dances
in
the
witches
sabbath
and
the
great
white
moon
seems
an
unclean
thing
images
of
clay
made
by
human
hands
come
to
diabolic
life
and
at
mystic
incantations
the
nymph
alanna
turns
the
pool
in
the
woodland
to
a
pool
of
fire
in
great
god
the
timeless
menace
comes
to
earth
again
corrupting
the
souls
of
men
and
women
rendering
them
unbelievably
vile
in
red
he
brings
together
ancient
runes
with
magic
power
black
stones
that
tell
secrets
of
buried
treasure
flinty
stone
like
obsidian
ten
thousand
years
old
that
murders
a
man
on
a
london
street
a
whorl
of
figures
that
tell
of
the
black
heaven
giving
an
impression
of
vast
ages
of
enigmatic
power
one
feels
one
should
rinse
his
mind
out
after
reading
arthur
stories
particularly
the
collection
called
three
this
discussion
has
taken
more
note
of
the
celtic
than
of
any
other
group
influence
because
more
than
any
other
it
has
left
its
imprint
on
modern
literature
there
are
hundreds
of
volumes
of
of
the
supernatural
in
english
but
the
celtic
revival
has
molded
its
legends
into
literature
that
is
its
own
excuse
for
being
in
the
work
of
this
school
we
get
a
passionate
mysticism
a
poetic
symbolism
that
we
find
scarcely
anywhere
else
in
english
prose
save
in
such
rhapsodic
passages
as
some
of
de
quincey
impassioned
prose
melody
which
forms
so
large
a
part
of
the
effect
of
supernaturalism
in
poetry
is
here
employed
to
heighten
lyric
prose
some
of
the
wild
stories
are
like
the
croon
of
the
peasant
mother
by
her
cradle
beside
the
some
like
wild
barbaric
runes
of
terrible
unguessed
import
some
like
the
of
some
like
the
keening
of
women
beside
their
dead
the
essential
poetry
of
the
celtic
soul
pours
itself
forth
in
rapturous
wistful
music
now
like
a
chant
a
hymn
a
a
lament
for
the
lost
soul
in
the
celtic
we
get
a
mixture
of
romances
of
the
survivals
of
barbaric
days
the
ancient
druid
myths
the
pagan
legends
savage
beliefs
overlaid
and
interwoven
with
the
later
christian
traditions
sometimes
the
old
pagan
myths
themselves
become
moral
allegories
the
legend
being
used
to
tell
a
moral
truth
but
for
the
most
part
there
is
no
attempt
at
teaching
save
that
which
comes
spontaneously
the
outburst
of
passionate
poetic
romance
the
heritage
of
a
people
that
love
wonder
and
beauty
the
pagan
poetry
of
the
gaelic
race
lives
on
and
throbs
over
again
in
fiona
mcleod
symbolic
moralities
the
mystical
figures
of
awe
and
woe
appear
from
the
dim
past
a
rapturous
paganism
showing
through
the
medieval
religious
brooding
yet
they
are
so
symbolic
of
the
spirit
that
they
are
timeless
coming
as
they
do
out
of
the
dim
legendary
past
they
may
reflect
the
veiled
years
of
the
future
they
are
mystic
chronicles
of
the
soul
as
in
divine
where
the
body
and
will
alike
shrink
back
from
that
silent
foreigner
the
soul
in
the
stories
of
yeats
we
get
similar
effects
the
weird
power
of
the
old
bards
the
gift
of
a
spiritual
vision
the
spiritual
sense
that
hears
past
the
broken
discordant
sounds
the
music
of
the
world
the
power
to
catch
the
moment
that
trembles
with
the
song
of
immortal
powers
we
hear
faint
whispers
catch
fleeting
glimpses
of
the
dim
people
see
again
the
druids
the
culdees
the
ancient
bards
and
heroes
we
discern
in
the
celtic
literature
a
sadness
dim
unreasoning
yet
deep
such
as
we
see
in
the
faces
of
animals
and
little
children
we
see
such
symbolism
as
that
of
the
lovers
who
have
mirrors
instead
of
hearts
seeing
only
their
own
images
throughout
eternity
we
feel
the
poetic
thoughts
drifting
past
us
like
sweet
falling
bright
with
the
colors
of
bygone
years
like
fluttering
like
happy
sighs
yet
again
they
are
terrible
trumpets
blown
in
the
day
of
doom
we
have
the
modern
mysticism
and
symbolism
side
by
side
with
the
old
druidic
mysticism
which
seems
like
with
deep
spiritual
import
yeats
makes
us
feel
that
the
old
divinities
are
not
dead
but
have
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
hearts
of
poets
and
writers
of
romance
and
that
the
land
of
faery
is
all
about
us
if
we
would
only
see
but
we
lack
the
poetic
vision
he
makes
us
see
the
actuality
of
thought
that
thinking
has
its
own
vital
being
and
goes
out
into
the
world
like
a
living
thing
possessed
by
some
wandering
soul
he
shows
us
that
thought
can
create
black
hounds
or
silver
doves
to
follow
the
soul
bring
to
life
at
will
a
divinity
or
a
demon
a
certain
supernatural
element
of
style
seems
to
lend
itself
to
some
of
the
writers
of
strange
fiction
some
of
oscar
wilde
sentences
unfold
like
wild
exotic
flowers
in
a
perfumed
beauty
that
suggests
a
subtle
poison
at
the
heart
lord
dunsany
writes
joyously
of
fantastic
creatures
with
a
happy
grace
sometimes
like
a
lilting
laugh
sometimes
a
lyric
rhapsody
his
evoked
beings
are
sportive
or
awesome
but
never
unclean
arthur
machen
stories
have
an
effect
like
a
slimy
trail
of
some
loathly
beast
or
serpent
william
morris
style
is
like
an
old
norse
rune
while
algernon
blackwood
makes
us
think
of
awakened
elemental
forces
hostile
to
man
we
feel
bodiless
emotions
feelings
unclothed
with
flesh
sad
formless
spirits
blown
on
the
winds
of
the
world
these
reflect
the
sweet
carelessness
of
the
irish
soul
the
stern
sadness
of
the
scotch
the
psychic
subtlety
of
the
modern
english
and
as
the
study
of
has
influenced
the
fiction
of
the
supernatural
so
these
published
romances
have
aroused
a
wondering
interest
in
the
legendry
of
the
past
and
made
of
a
science
chapter
vii
supernatural
science
the
application
of
modern
science
to
supernaturalism
or
of
the
supernatural
to
modern
science
is
one
of
the
distinctive
features
of
recent
literature
ghostly
fiction
took
a
new
and
definite
turn
with
the
rapid
advance
in
scientific
knowledge
and
investigation
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
the
work
of
darwin
spencer
huxley
and
their
did
as
much
to
quicken
thought
in
romance
as
in
other
lines
previous
literature
had
made
but
scant
effort
to
reflect
even
the
crude
science
of
the
times
and
what
was
written
was
so
unconvincing
that
it
made
comparatively
little
impress
almost
the
only
science
that
gothic
fiction
dealt
with
to
any
noticeable
extent
was
associated
with
alchemy
and
astrology
the
alchemist
sought
the
philosopher
stone
and
the
elixir
of
life
while
the
astrologer
tried
to
divine
human
destiny
by
the
stars
zofloya
dabbled
in
diabolic
chemistry
and
frankenstein
created
a
that
was
noteworthy
as
an
incursion
into
supernatural
biology
yet
they
are
almost
isolated
instances
now
each
advance
in
science
has
had
its
reflection
in
supernatural
fiction
and
each
phase
of
research
contributes
plot
material
while
some
of
the
elements
once
considered
wholly
of
the
devil
are
now
scientific
the
sorcerer
has
given
place
to
the
bacteriologist
and
the
botanist
the
marvels
of
discovery
have
displaced
miracles
as
basis
for
unearthly
plot
material
and
it
is
from
the
laboratory
that
the
ghostly
stories
are
now
evolved
rather
than
from
the
vault
and
as
in
the
past
science
not
only
furnishes
extraordinary
situations
for
curdling
tales
but
it
is
an
excellent
hook
to
hang
supernatural
tales
upon
for
it
gives
an
excuse
for
believing
anything
however
incredible
man
is
willing
to
accept
the
impossible
if
he
be
but
given
a
modern
excuse
for
it
he
will
swallow
the
wildest
improbability
if
the
bait
be
labeled
science
or
psychical
research
no
supernaturalism
is
incredible
if
it
is
expressed
in
technical
terminology
and
no
miracle
will
be
rejected
if
its
setting
be
in
a
laboratory
one
peculiar
thing
about
modern
scientific
thought
in
its
reaction
upon
fiction
is
that
it
is
equally
effective
in
realism
such
as
shown
in
the
naturalistic
novels
of
zola
the
plays
of
brieux
and
others
and
in
supernaturalism
as
in
the
work
of
wells
for
instance
where
the
ghostly
is
grafted
on
to
cold
realism
the
transition
from
the
sorcerer
the
wizard
the
warlock
of
older
fiction
to
the
scientist
in
the
present
has
been
gradual
the
sorcerer
relied
wholly
upon
supernatural
chiefly
diabolic
agencies
for
his
power
while
the
wizard
of
the
modern
laboratory
applies
his
knowledge
of
molecules
and
gases
to
aid
his
supermortal
forces
modern
science
itself
seems
miraculous
so
its
employment
in
ghostly
stories
is
but
natural
the
nights
seem
not
more
marvelous
than
the
stories
of
modern
investigations
hawthorne
narratives
stand
between
the
old
and
the
new
types
of
science
his
rappaccini
heidigger
gaffer
dolliver
septimius
felton
and
his
rivals
in
search
for
the
elixir
of
youth
as
well
as
the
husband
who
sought
to
efface
the
birthmark
from
his
young
wife
cheek
being
related
in
theme
to
the
older
conventional
type
and
in
treatment
to
the
new
poe
scientific
stories
are
more
modern
in
method
and
material
and
in
fact
he
made
claim
of
originality
of
invention
for
the
idea
of
making
fiction
plausible
by
the
use
of
scientific
laws
his
into
the
found
in
a
and
other
stories
were
novel
in
the
manner
in
which
they
united
the
scientifically
real
and
the
supernatural
pit
and
the
with
its
diabolical
machinery
is
akin
to
the
modern
mechanistic
stories
rather
than
to
anything
that
had
preceded
it
poe
paved
the
way
for
wells
use
of
the
ghostly
mechanical
and
scientific
narratives
as
his
stories
of
hypnotism
with
its
hideous
aftermath
of
horror
must
have
given
suggestion
for
arthur
machen
revolting
stories
of
physical
operations
with
unearthly
consequences
an
example
of
the
later
manifestations
of
supernaturalism
in
connection
with
science
is
in
sax
rohmer
tales
of
the
chinese
terror
the
embodied
spirit
of
an
ancient
evil
that
entered
into
him
at
his
birth
because
of
his
nearness
to
an
old
and
who
to
his
unholy
alliance
unites
a
wizard
knowledge
of
modern
science
in
its
various
aspects
with
every
power
of
cunning
and
intellect
intensified
with
a
technical
knowledge
of
all
means
with
which
to
fight
his
enemies
he
ravages
society
as
no
mere
sorcerer
of
early
fiction
could
do
the
modern
stories
of
magic
have
a
skillful
power
of
suggestiveness
being
so
cunningly
contrived
that
on
the
surface
they
seem
plausible
and
natural
with
nothing
supernatural
about
them
yet
behind
this
seeming
simplicity
lurks
a
mystery
an
unanswered
question
an
unsolved
problem
jacobs
monkey
for
instance
is
one
of
the
most
effectively
terrible
stories
of
magic
that
one
could
conceive
of
the
shriveled
paw
of
a
dead
monkey
that
is
believed
by
some
to
give
its
possessor
the
right
to
have
three
wishes
granted
becomes
the
symbol
of
inescapable
destiny
the
weird
or
fate
of
the
old
tragedy
though
the
horrors
that
follow
upon
the
wishes
rash
utterance
be
explained
on
natural
grounds
the
insidious
enigma
is
what
makes
the
story
unforgettable
barry
pain
might
be
given
as
another
example
of
problematic
magic
that
owes
its
power
to
elusive
mystery
the
the
solitary
fate
who
appears
to
persons
offering
them
such
dreadful
alternatives
might
be
conceived
of
as
the
figment
of
sick
brains
yet
the
reader
knows
that
she
is
not
richard
middleton
coffin
seems
simple
enough
on
the
surface
and
the
could
explain
the
occurrence
on
normal
grounds
yet
the
story
has
a
peculiar
haunting
supernaturalism
a
coffin
merchant
claims
to
be
able
to
know
who
among
will
die
soon
and
hands
a
man
an
advertisement
for
a
coffin
asserting
that
he
will
need
it
the
man
later
goes
to
the
shop
to
rebuke
the
merchant
for
his
methods
but
ends
by
signing
a
contract
for
his
own
funeral
on
leaving
he
shakes
hands
with
the
dealer
after
which
he
unconsciously
puts
his
hand
to
his
lips
feeling
a
slight
sting
he
dies
that
night
of
what
of
poison
of
fear
of
supernatural
suggestion
or
in
the
natural
course
of
events
the
series
called
strange
cases
of
by
josephine
daskam
bacon
shows
instances
occurring
among
the
clientele
of
a
famous
brain
specialist
where
the
materialist
might
put
aside
the
explanation
of
the
supernatural
only
to
be
confronted
by
still
greater
problems
the
relation
between
insanity
and
ghostliness
in
recent
fiction
is
significant
and
forms
the
crux
of
many
a
story
since
poe
bacon
for
instance
has
its
setting
in
an
insane
asylum
but
the
uncanny
happenings
almost
convince
us
of
the
sanity
of
the
patients
and
the
paranoia
of
the
outsiders
we
come
to
agree
with
the
specialist
that
every
person
is
more
or
less
a
paranoiac
and
none
more
so
than
he
who
scoffs
at
the
supernatural
another
aspect
of
the
transfer
of
magic
in
modern
fiction
to
a
scientific
basis
is
that
of
second
sight
or
supernatural
vision
this
motif
still
retains
all
its
former
effect
of
the
unearthly
perhaps
gaining
more
since
the
scientific
twist
seems
to
give
the
idea
that
the
ghostly
power
resides
in
the
atoms
and
molecules
and
gases
and
machines
themselves
rather
than
in
the
person
who
manipulates
them
which
is
more
subtly
haunting
in
its
impression
second
sight
has
been
used
as
a
means
for
producing
uncanny
effects
all
along
the
line
of
fiction
defoe
even
used
it
in
a
number
of
his
hoax
pamphlets
as
well
as
in
his
of
duncan
and
is
full
of
such
stories
especially
in
the
highlands
the
modern
use
of
supernatural
vision
is
based
apparently
on
natural
science
which
makes
the
weird
power
more
striking
black
by
randolph
hartley
tells
of
an
experiment
in
optics
that
produces
a
strange
result
two
students
exchange
left
eyeballs
for
the
purpose
of
studying
the
effects
of
the
operation
leaving
the
right
eye
in
each
case
unimpaired
when
the
young
men
recover
from
the
operation
and
the
bandages
are
removed
they
discover
that
an
extraordinary
thing
has
taken
place
the
first
while
seeing
with
his
right
eye
his
own
surroundings
as
usual
sees
also
with
his
left
which
is
his
friend
left
that
is
what
that
friend
is
looking
at
with
his
right
eye
thousands
of
miles
away
the
severing
of
the
optic
nerve
has
not
disturbed
the
sympathetic
vision
between
the
companion
eyes
so
this
curious
double
sight
results
in
a
quarrel
arising
from
this
peculiar
situation
the
first
man
kills
the
second
and
sees
on
his
left
eye
the
hideous
image
of
his
own
face
distorted
with
murderous
rage
as
his
friend
saw
it
which
is
never
to
be
effaced
because
the
companion
eye
is
dead
and
will
see
no
more
another
instance
of
farsightedness
is
told
in
john
kendrick
speck
on

where
a
man
has
such
an
extraordinary
left
eye
that
when
he
looks
through
a
lens
he
sees
round
the
world
and
gets
a
glimpse
of
the
back
of
his
own
head
which
he
thinks
is
a
speck
on
the
lens
only
two
men
in
the
world
are
supposed
to
have
that
power
remarkable
case
of
davidson
by
wells
is
an
interesting
example
of
this
new
scientific
transference
of
magic
vision
davidson

working
in
a
laboratory
which
is
struck
by

instead

this
is
an
instance
of
the
suggestive
supernaturalism
associated
with
dreams
and
visions
the
use
of
mirrors
in
supernatural
vision
is
significant
and
appears
in
a
number
of
ways
in
modern
fiction
scott
aunt
is
an
early
instance
where
the
magician
shows
the
seeker
a
glass
wherein
she
sees
what
is
taking
place
in
another
country
sees
her
husband
on
his
way
to
the
altar
with
another
woman
sees
a
stranger
stop
the
marriage
and
witnesses
the
fatal
duel
hawthorne
has
used
mirrors
extensively
as
symbolic
of
an
inner
vision
of
a
look
into
the
realities
of
the
soul
for
instance
when
poor
feathertop
the
man
the
animated
scarecrow
looks
into
the
mirror
he
sees
not
the
brave
figure
the
world
beholds
in
him
but
the
thing
of
sticks
and
straw
the
sham
that
he
is
as
the
minister
shrinks
from
the
mirrored
reflection
of
the
black
veil
symbol
of
mystery
that
he
wears
hawthorne
elsewhere
speaks
of
echo
as
the
voice
of
the
reflection
in

and
says
that
our
reflections
are
ghosts
of
ourselves
titbottom

silver
by
conan
doyle
represents
a
man
alone
night
after
night
working
with
overstrained
nerves
on
a
set
of
books
who
sees
in
an
antique
mirror
a
strange
scene
and
finds
later
that
the

has
once
belonged
to
mary
queen
of
scots
and
that
he
has
seen
the
murder
of
rizzio
brander
matthews
also
has
a
story
concerned
with
images
in
an
old
mirror
the
in
fiction
seems
to
be
not
only
a
sort
of
hand
conscience
as
markheim
calls
it
but
a
betrayer
of
secrets
a
revealer
of
the
forgotten
past
a
prophet
of
the
future
as
well
it
is
also
a
strange
symbol
to
show
hearts
as
they
are
in
reality
reflecting
the
soul
rather
than
the
body
it
is
employed
in
diverse
ways
and
is
an
effective
means
of
supernatural
suggestion
of
ghostly
power
the
fourth
dimension
is
another
motif
that
seems
to
interest
the
writers
of
recent
ghostly
tales
they
make
use
of
it
in
various
ways
and
seem
to
have
different
ideas
concerning
it
but
they
like
to
play
with
the
thought
and
twist
it
to
their
whim
ambrose
bierce
has
a
collection
of
stories
dealing
with
mysterious
disappearances
in
which
he
tells
of
persons
who
are
transferred
from
the
known
calculable
space
to
some
space
where
they
are
lost
in
some
strange
pockets
of
nowhere
they
fall
unable
to
see
or
to
be
seen
to
hear
or
to
be
heard
neither
living
nor
dying
since
in
that
space
is
no
power
of
life
or
of
death
it
is
all
very
mysterious
and
uncanny
he
uses
the
theme
as
the
basis
for
a
number
of
short
stories
of
ghostly
power
which
offer
no
solution
but
leave
the
mystery
in
the
air
in
some
of
these
stories
bierce
represents
the
person
as
crying
out
and
being
heard
but
no
help
can
go
because
he
is
invisible
and
intangible
not
knowing
where
he
is
nor
what
has
happened
to
him
wells
in
plattner
which
shows
an
obvious
influence
of
bierce
gives
a
similar
case
he
explains
the
extraordinary
happenings
by
advancing
the
theory
that
plattner
has
changed
sides
according
to
mathematics
he
says
we
are
told
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
right
and
left
sides
of
a
solid
body
can
be
changed
is
by
taking
that
body
clean
out
of
space
as
we
know
it
out
of
ordinary
existence
that
is
and
turning
it
somewhere
outside
space
plattner
has
been
moved
out
into
the
fourth
dimension
and
been
returned
to
the
world
with
a
curious
inversion
of
body
he
is
absent
from
the
world
for
nine
days
and
has
extraordinary
experiences
in
the
this
happens
through
an
explosion
in
the
laboratory
where
he
is
working
similarly
to
story
of
davidson
where
the
infringement
on
the
fourth
dimension
is
the
result
of
a
lightning
stroke
mary
wilkins
freeman
deals
with
the
fourth
dimension
in
hall
where
the
boarder
drifts
off
into
unknown
space
never
to
return
from
gazing
at
a
picture
on
the
wall
as
has
happened
in
the
case
of
previous
occupants
of
the
room
richard
middleton
employs
the
same
idea
in
a
story
of
a
conjurer
who
nightly
plays
a
trick
in
public
causing
his
wife
to
seem
to
disappear
into
space
one
night
she
actually
does
so
vanish
never
to
be
seen
again
other
instances
of
the
form
may
be
found
in
recent
fiction
wells
uses
the
theme
with
a
different
twist
in
his
here
the
scientist
insists
that
time
is
the
fourth
dimension
that
persons
who
talk
of
the
matter
ordinarily
have
no
idea
of
what
it
is
but
that
he
has
solved
it
he
constructs
a
machine
which
enables
him
to
project
himself
into
the
future
or
into
the
past
and
sees
what
will
happen
or
what
has
happened
in
other
centuries
he
lives
years
in
the
space
of
a
few
moments
and
has
amazing
adventures
on
his
temporal
expeditions
but
finally
the
fourth
dimension
which
may
be
thought
of
as
a
terrible
fate
or
inescapable
destiny
awaiting
all
who
dally
with
it
gets
him
too
for
he
fails
to
return
from
one
of
his
trips

of
a
man
who
by
drinking
quantities
of

perhaps
the
instance

supernaturalism
here
the

not

changes
the

evolving
from

respectable

his
baser
self
in

to

instincts
without
bringing

subtle
power
to
fix
the
personality
of
evil
so
that
each
time
the
drug
is
used
hyde
is
given
a
stronger
force
and
jekyll
is
weakened
this
fictive
sermon
on
dual
nature
the
ascendence
of
evil
over
the
nobler
soul
if
it
be
indulged
seems
yet
an
appallingly
real
story
of
human
life
in
a
similar
fashion
arthur

uses
supernatural
chemistry
most
hideously
in

where
a

perverts
the
soul
making

in
the
unspeakable
orgies
of
ancient
evil
forces
invisible
by
wells
shows
an
unusual
application
of
chemistry
to
ghostly
fiction
that
gives
a
peculiar
effect
of
reality
because
its
style
is
that
of
scientific
realism
by
experimentation
with
drugs
a
man
finds
a
combination
that
will
render
living
tissue
absolutely
invisible
when
he
swallows
a
portion
of
it
he
can
not
be
seen
his
clothes
appear
to
be
walking
around
by
themselves
and
the
complications
are
uncanny
as
one
may
see
the
comic
possibilities
are
prominent
and
for
a
time
we
laugh
over
the
mystification
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
but
soon
stark
tragedy
results
during
the
as
the
hunted
creature
seeks
to
escape
the
people
hear
the
of
running
steps
watch
bloody
footprints
form
before
their
eyes
yet
see
nothing
else
here
is
a
genuine
thrill
that
is
new
in
fiction
the
man
gradually
becomes
visible
but
only
in
death
is
his
dreadful
figure
seen
completely
again
this
modern
method
of
transferring
to
science
the
idea
of
invisibility
so
prominent
in
connection
with
ghosts
showing
the
invisibility
as
the
result
of
a
chemical
compound
not
of
supernatural
intervention
affecting
a
living
man
not
a
spirit
makes
the
effect
of
supernaturalism
more
vivid
even
than
in
the
case
of
ghosts
these
are
only
suggestions
of
the
varied
uses
to
which
chemistry
has
been
put
in
producing
ghostly
plots
and
utilizing
in
novel
ways
the
conventional
motifs
of
older
stories
these
themes
are
more
popular
now
than
they
would
have
been
half
a
century
ago
because
now
the
average
reader
knows
more
about
scientific
facts
and
is
better
prepared
to
appreciate
them
a
man
ignorant
of
chemistry
would
care
nothing
for
the
throes
of
jekyll
or
the
complicating
experiences
of
the
invisible
man
because
he
would
have
slight
basis
for
his
imagination
to
build
upon
each
widening
of
the
popular
intelligence
and
each
branch
of
science
added
to
the
mental
store
of
the
ordinary
reader
is
a
distinct
gain
to
fiction
supernatural
biology
looms
large
in
modern
fiction
though
it
is
not
always
easy
to
differentiate
between
the
predominance
of
chemical
and
biological
motifs
in
many
cases
the
two
are
tangled
up
together
and
as
in
the
stories
of
dual
personality
and

psychology

some
interesting
contributions
to

along
the
line
of
what
might
be
called
momentary
or
instantaneous

ambrose

a
good
example
where
a

and
changes
the
current
of
his
life
while
algernon
blackwood
compresses
a
great
experience
into
a
few
minutes
of
dreaming
one
noteworthy
point
in
connection
with
the
scientific
supernaturalism
is
that
these
themes
appear
only
in
novels
and
short
stories
they
do
not
cross
over
into
poetry
as
do
most
of
the
other
forms
of
the
ghostly
art
perhaps
this
is
because
the
situations
are
intellectual
rather
than
emotional
or
studies
in
mechanisms
rather
than
in
feelings
or
emotions
the
province
of
science
is
removed
from
that
of
poetry
because
the
methods
and
purposes
are
altogether
different
the
scientific
methods
are
coldly
intellectual
science
demands
an
exactness
a
meticulous
accuracy
hostile
to
poetry
which
requires
suggestion
vagueness
veiled
mystery
for
its
greatest
effect
flower
of
for
instance
would
be
a
fitting
title
for
a
poem
but
the
poetic
effect
would
be
destroyed
by
the
need
for
stating
the
genus
and
species
of
the
orchid
and
analyzing
its
destruction
of
human
tissue
nature
mysterious
forces
and
elements
in
general
and
vaguely
considered
veiled
in
mists
of
imagination
and
with
a
sense
of
vastness
and
beauty
are
extremely
poetic
but
the
notebook
and
laboratory
methods
of
pure
science
are
antagonistic
to
poetry
though
they
fit
admirably
into
the
requirements
of
fiction
whose
purpose
is
to
give
an
impression
of
actuality
another
reason
why
these
scientific
themes
do
not
pass
over
into
poetry
may
be
that
scientific
methods
as
we
know
them
are
new
and
poetry
clings
to
the
old
and
established
conventions
and
emotions
there
is
amazing
human
interest
in
these
experiments
a
veritable
wealth
of
romance
with
dramatic
possibilities
tragic
and
comic
yet
they
are
more
suited
to
prose
fiction
than
to
poetry
we
have
adapted
our
to
their
concepts
in
prose
yet
we
have
not
thus
molded
our
poetic
ideas
it
gives
us
a
shock
to
have
new
concepts
introduced
into
poetry
an
instance
of
this
clash
of
realism
with
sentiment
is
shown
in
a
recent
poem
where
the
setting
is
a
physics
laboratory
yet
in
a
few
more
decades
we
may
find
the
poets
eagerly
converting
the
raw
materials
of
science
into
the
essence
of
poetry
itself
and
by
a
mystic
alchemy
more
wonderful
than
any
yet
known
transmuting
intellectual
problems
of
science
into
magic
verse
by
alfred
noyes
is
an
impressive
discussion
of
evolution
as
related
to
god
perhaps
another
reason
why
these
themes
have
not
been
utilized
in
poetry
is
because
they
are
too
fantastic
too
bizarre
they
lack
the
proportion
and
sense
of
artistic
harmony
that
poetry
requires
strangeness
and
wonder
are
true
elements
of
poetry
and
magic
is
an
element
of
the
greatest
art
but
in
solution
as
it
were
not
in
the
form
observed
in
science
the
miracles
of
the
laboratory
are
too
abrupt
too
inconceivable
save
by
intellectual
analysis
and
present
too
great
a
strain
upon
the
powers
of
the
imagination
they
are
fantastic
while
true
poetry
is
concerned
with
the
fancy
magic
and
wonder
in
verse
must
come
from
concepts
that
steal
upon
the
imagination
and
make
appeal
through
the
emotions
thus
some
forms
of
supernaturalism
are
admirably
adapted
to
the
province
of
poetry
such
as
the
presence
of
spirits
visitations
of
angels
or
demons
ancient
witchcraft
and
so
forth
the
elements
that
have
universal
appeal
through
the
sense
of
the
supernatural
move
us
in
poetry
but
the
isolated
instances
the
peculiar
problems
that
occur
in
scientific
research
if
transferred
to
poetry
would
leave
us
cold
yet
they
may
come
to
be
used
in
the
next
nor
do
these
situations
come
over
into
the
drama
save
in
rare
instances
theodore
dreiser
in
a
recent
volume
of
the
natural
and
the
makes
use
of
certain
motifs
that
are
striking
and
modern
as
where
a
physician
goes
on
the
the
including
demyaphon
nitrous
acid
and
alcepheron
a
power
of
physics
as
well
as
several
shadows
mysterious
personages
of
vagueness
these
shadows
here
as
in
blue
are
not
altogether
clear
as
to
motivation
yet
they
seem
to
stand
for
fate
interference
in
human
destiny
in
the
latter
play
fate
is
also
represented
by
a
fast
mail
which
is
one
of
the
active
characters
menacing
and
destroying
a
child
in
one
reason
why
these
motifs
of
science
are
not
used
in
drama
to
any
extent
is
that
they
are
impossible
of
representation
on
the
stage
even
the
wizardry
of
modern
producers
would
be
unable
to
show
a
power
of
physics
or
nitrous
acid
save
as
they
might
be
embodied
as
were
the
symbolic
characters
in
maeterlinck
which
would
mean
that
they
would
lose
their
effect
and
what
would
a
stage
manager
do
with
the
rhythm
of
the
universe
which
enters
into
dreiser
play
many
sounds
can
be
managed
off
stage
but
hardly
that
one
fancies
these
themes
are
not
even
found
in
closet
drama
where
many
other
elements
of
supernaturalism
which
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
of
presentation
on
the
stage
trail
off

for
instance
could
not
be
shown
on
the
stage
yet
the
little
plays
in
that
volume
are
of
wonderful
dramatic
power
the
drama
can
stand
a
good
deal
of
supernaturalism
of
various
kinds
from
the
visible
ghosts
and
devils
of
the
elizabethans
to
the
atmospheric
supernaturalism
of
maeterlinck
but
it
could
scarcely
support
the
presentations
of
chemicals
and
gases
and
supernatural
botany
and
biology
that
fiction
handles
with
ease
the
miraculous
machinery
would
balk
at
stage
action
fancy
the
time
machine
staged
for
instance
we
notice
in
these
scientific
stories
a
widening
of
the
sphere
of
supernatural
fiction
it
is
extended
to
include
more
of
the
normal
interests
and
activities
of
man
than
has
formerly
been
the
case
here
we
notice
a
spirit
similar
to
that
of
the
leveling
influence
seen
in
the
case
of
the
ghosts
devils
witches
angels
and
so
forth
who
have
been
made
more
human
not
only
in
appearance
but
in
emotions
and
activities
as
well
likewise
these
scientific
elements
have
been
elevated
to
the
human
supernatural
as
well
as
human
attributes
have
been
extended
to
material
things
as
animals
are
given
supernormal
powers
in
a
sense
different
from
and
yet
similar
to
those
possessed
by
the
enchanted
animals
in
science
has
its
physical
as
well
as
psychic
horrors
which
the
scientific
ghostly
tales
bring
in
not
only
are
animals
gifted
with
supernatural
powers
but
plants
as
well
are
humanized
diabolized
we
have
strange
murderous
trees
vampire
orchids
flowers
that
slay
men
in
secret
ways
with
all
the
smiling
loveliness
of
a
treacherous
woman
the
dæmonics
of
modern
botany
form
an
interesting
phase
of
ghostly
fiction
and
give
a
new
thrill
to
supernaturalism
inanimate
concrete
things
are
endowed
with
unearthly
cunning
and
strength
as
well
as
animals
and
plants
the
new
type
of
fiction
gives
to
chemicals
and
gases
a
hellish
intelligence
a
diabolic
force
of
minds
it
creates
machinery
and
gives
it
an
excess
of
force
a
supernatural
more
than
human
cunning
sometimes
helpful
sometimes
dæmonic
machines
have
been
spiritualized
and
some
engines
are
philanthropic
while
some
are
like
damned
souls
this
scientific
supernaturalism
concerns
itself
with
mortal
life
not
with
immortality
as
do
some
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
it
is
concrete
in
its
effects
not
spiritual
its
incursions
into
futurity
are
earthly
not
of
heaven
or
hell
and
its
problems
are
of
time
not
of
eternity
the
form
shows
how
clear
cold
intelligence
plays
with
miracles
and
applies
the
supernatural
to
daily
life
the
enthusiasm
wild
and
exaggerated
in
some
ways
that
sprang
up
over
the
prospects
of
what
modern
science
and
investigation
would
almost
immediately
do
for
the
world
in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
no
more
interesting
effect
than
in
the
stimulating
of
scientific
fictive
supernaturalism
and
though
mankind
has
learned
that
science
will
not
immediately
bring
the
millennium
science
still
exercises
a
strong
power
over
fiction
this
type
shows
a
strange
effect
of
realism
in
supernaturalism
because
of
the
scientific
methods
for
supernaturalism
imposed
on
material
things
produces
an
effect
of
verisimilitude
not
gained
in
the
realm
of
pure
spirit
too
intellectually
cold
for
the
purposes
of
poetry
too
abstract
and
elusive
for
presentation
in
drama
and
too
removed
by
its
association
with
the
fantastic
aspects
of
investigation
and
the
curiosities
of
science
to
be
very
appropriate
for
tragedy
which
has
hitherto
been
the
chief
medium
of
expressing
the
dramatic
supernatural
science
finds
its
fitting
expression
in
prose
fiction
it
is
an
illustration
of
the
widening
range
of
the
supernatural
in
fiction
and
as
such
is
significant
chapter
viii
conclusion
in
the
previous
chapters
i
have
endeavored
to
show
the
continuance
and
persistence
of
the
supernatural
in
english
fiction
as
well
as
in
other
forms
of
literature
and
to
give
some
idea
of
the
variety
of
its
manifestations
there
has
been
no
period
in
our
history
from
beowulf
to
the
present
when
the
ghostly
was
not
found
in
our
literature
of
course
there
have
been
periods
when
the
interest
in
it
waned
yet
it
has
never
been
wholly
absent
there
is
at
the
present
a
definite
revival
of
interest
in
the
supernatural
appearing
in
the
drama
in
poetry
and
in
fiction
evident
to
anyone
who
has
carefully
studied
the
recent
publications
and
magazines
within
the
last
few
years
especially
in
the
last
two
years
an
astonishing
amount
of
ghostly
material
has
appeared
some
of
these
stories
are
of
the
hoax
variety
others
are
suggestive
allegorical
or
symbolic
while
others
frankly
accept
the
forces
beyond
man
mortal
life
and
human
dominion
i
hesitate
to
suggest
a
reason
for
this
sudden
rising
tide
of
occultism
at
this
particular
time
but
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
the
war
has
had
much
to
do
with
it
i
have
found
a
number
of
supernatural
productions
directly
associated
with
the
struggle
among
them
might
be
mentioned
katherine
fullerton
gerould
extraordinary

the

a

a

a

by
different

describing
some
of
the
phantoms
seen
by
soldiers
on
the
battlefield
and
arthur
machen
a
collection
of
striking
fictive
instances
of
associated
with
the
war
the
last
volume
affords
an
interesting
glimpse
into
the
way
in
which
legends
are
built
up
for
it
is
a
contemporary
legend
in
connection
with
the
angels
at
mons
carl
hauptmann
has
a
striking
play
showing
the
use
of
in
the
drama
when
the
eyes
of
the
world
are
turned
toward
the
battlefields
and
death
is
an
reality
it
is
natural
that
human
thoughts
occupy
themselves
with
visions
of
a
life
after
death
by
vida
sutton
shows
the
spirits
of
russian
peasants
slain
for
refusing
to
fight
specters
unaware
that
they
are
dead
various
martial
heroes
of
the
past
are
resurrected
to
give
inspiration
in
battle
in
recent
stories
and
dead
are
in
the
may
but
whatever
be
the
reason
for
this
revival
of
the
ghostly
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
distinctly
the
day
for
the
phantom
and
his
confrères
while
romanticism
is
always
with
us
it
appears
in
different
manifestations
a
few
years
ago
the
swashbuckling
hero
and
his
adventures
seemed
the
most
striking
survival
of
the
earlier
days
of
romanticism
but
now
the
weird
and
the
ghostly
have
regained
a
popularity
which
they
never
surpassed
even
in
the
heyday
of
gothic
fiction
the
slashing
sword
has
been
displaced
by
the
psychographic
pen
the
crucial
struggles
now
are
occult
rather
than
adventurous
as
before
and
while
realism
in
fiction
is
immensely
popular
never
more
so
than
now
it
is
likely
to
have
supernaturalism
overlaid
upon
it
as
in
de
morgan
work
to
give
a
single
example
recent
poetry
manifests
the
same
tendency
and
likewise
the
drama
particularly
the
closet
drama
and
the
playlet
while
literary
history
shows
clearly
the
continuity
of
the
supernatural
with
certain
rise
and
fall
of
interest
in
it
at
different
periods
it
is
apparent
that
now
there
is
a
more
general
fondness
for
the
form
than
at
any
other
period
in
english
literature
the
supernatural
is
in
solution
and
exists
everywhere
recent
poetry
shows
a
strong
predilection
for
the
uncanny
sometimes
in
the
manner
of
the
old
ballads
while
in
other
instances
the
ghostly
is
treated
with
a
spirit
of
critical
detachment
as
in
rupert
brooke
sonnet
or
with
skepticism
as
in
his
sardonic
satire
on
faith
in
the
recent
volume
of
brooke
collected
poems
there
are
about
a
dozen
dealing
with
the
supernatural
maeterlinck
expressed
the
feeling
that
a
spiritual
epoch
is
perhaps
upon
us
as
poe
said
that
we
are
in
the
midst
of
great
psychal
powers
as
francis
thompson
says
in
his
of
nature
poor
can
not
slake
our
drought
the
interest
in
certain
lines
of
thought
which
lead
to
the
writing
of
supernatural
fiction
as
spiritualism
or
or
science
or
psychical
research
may
have
the
reflex
action
of
arousing
interest
in
the
subjects
themselves
but
at
all
events
there
is
no
lack
of
uncanny
literature
at
present
by
some
of
the
proceedings
of
the
society
for
psychical
in
his
one
feature
of
the
modern
supernatural
literature
as
distinguished
from
that
of
other
periods
is
in
the
matter
of
length
of
course
the
ballad
and
the
expressed
the
ghostly
in
brief
form
but
the
epic
held
the
stage
longer
while
in
elizabethan
times
the
drama
was
the
preferred
form
as
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
gothic
novel
during
the
nineteenth
century
particularly
the
latter
half
the
preference
was
decidedly
for
the
short
story
while
more
recently
the
play
has
come
into
vogue
but
in
the
last
few
years
the
supernatural
novel
seems
to
be
returning
to
favor
though
without
displacing
the
shorter
forms
brevity
has
much
to
commend
it
as
a
vehicle
for
the
uncanny
the
effect
of
the
ghostly
may
be
attained
with
much
more
unity
in
a
short
story
or
playlet
than
in
a
novel
or
long
drama
for
in
the
more
lengthy
form
much
outside
matter
is
necessarily
included
the
whole
plot
could
scarcely
be
made
up
of
the
unearthly
for
that
would
mean
a
weakening
of
power
through
exaggeration
though
this
is
sometimes
found
to
be
the
case
as
in
several
of
bram
novels
recently
the
number
of
novels
dealing
with
supernatural
themes
has
noticeably
increased
which
leads
one
to
believe
that
the
occult
is
transcending
even
the
limitations
of
length
and
claiming
all
forms
for
its
own
now
no
literary
type
bars
the
supernatural
which
appears
in
the
novel
as
in
the
story
in
the
drama
as
in
the
playlet
and
in
narrative
dramatic
and
lyric
poetry
even
the
epic
of
the
more
than
mortal
has
not
entirely
vanished
as
the
work
of
william
cleaver
wilkinson
attests
but
popular
taste
does
not
really
run
to
epics
nowadays
the
ghostly
is
more
often
seen
in
the
shorter
forms
where
brevity
gives
a
chance
for
compression
and
intensity
of
force
difficult
in
longer
vehicles
the
rise
of
the
play
in
popular
favor
is
significant
in
this
connection
the
short
dramas
of
synge
yeats
lady
gregory
william
sharpe
gordon
bottomley
and
theodore
dreiser
show
the
possibilities
of
the
playlet
for
weird
effect
maeterlinck
plays
for
marionettes
are
especially
powerful
but
the
work
of
lord
dunsany
furnishes
more
peculiar
ghostliness
than
that
of
any
other
present
dramatist
his
jade
idols
for
instance
that
wake
to
terrible
life
and
revenge
themselves
on
presumptuous
mortals
are
a
new
touch
in
dramatics
algernon
blackwood
is
doing
more
significant
work
in
psychic
fiction
than
anyone
else
his
prose
showing
poetic
beauty
as
well
as
eerie
power
another
significant
fact
to
be
noted
in
connection
with
the
later
ghostly
stories
as
compared
with
the
gothic
is
in
the
greater
number
and
variety
of
materials
employed
the
early
religious
plays
had
introduced
devils
angels
and
divinity
to
a
considerable
extent
while
the
elizabethan
drama
relied
for
its
thrills
chiefly
on
the
witch
and
the
the
gothic
romance
was
strong
for
the
ghost
with
one
or
two
wandering
jews
occasional
werewolves
and
lycanthropes
and
sporadic
satanity
but
made
no
use
of
angels
or
of
divinity
the
modern
fiction
however
gathers
up
all
of
these
personages
and
puts
them
into
service
freely
in
addition
to
these
old
themes
brought
up
to
date
and
varied
astonishingly
the
new
fiction
has
adapted
other
types
the
scientific
supernaturalism
is
practically
new
save
for
the
gothic
employment
of
alchemy
and
astrology
and
now
all
the
discoveries
and
investigations
of
the
laboratory
are
utilized
and
embued
with
supernaturalism
diabolic
botany
psychological
chemistry
and
supermortal
biology
appear
in
recent
fiction
the
countless
arts
and
sciences
acoustics
optics
dietetics
and
are
levied
on
for
plots
while
astronomy
shows
us
wonders
the
astrologer
never
dreamed
of
the
stars
knew
their
place
and
kept
it
in
early
romance
but
they
are
given
to
strange
aberration
and
unaccountable
conduct
in
late
narration
the
futuristic
fiction
gives
us
return
trips
into
time
to
come
while
we
may
be
transported
into
the
far
past
as
with
mark
connecticut
yankee
that
visits
king
arthur
court
the
extent
to
which
a
homespun
realist
like
mark
twain
uses
the
supernatural
is
significant
no
province
or
small
corner
of
science
has
failed
to
furnish
material
for
the
new
ghostly
fiction
and
even
the
fourth
and
fifth
dimensions
are
brought
in
as
plot
complications
microscopes
are
bewitched
mirrors
are
enchanted
and
science
reverses
its
own
laws
at
will
to
suit
the
weird
demands
another
modern
material
is
the
mechanistic
this
is
the
age
of
machinery
and
even
engines
are
run
by
examples
of
the
mechanical
spook
are
legion
there
is
the
haunted
automobile
in
harriet
prescott
spofford
story
mad
that
reproduces
through
its
speaking
tube
the
voice
that
runs
away
with
its
occupants
reliving
previous
tragic
experiences
a
phantom
ford
is
an
idea
combining
romanticism
with
realism
surely
in
connection
with
this
extraordinary
car
is
a
house
that
erects
itself
out
of
dreams
and
is
substantial
enough
for
living
purposes
other
specimens
are

likewise

that
permits
the

to

himself

or
the

to

the

shows
the
spiritualization
of
machinery
as
the
poor
artist
of
the
beautiful
conceived
it
the
delicate
toy
imbibing
a
magnetism
a
spiritual
essence
that
gives
it
life
and
beauty
and
power
of
voluntary
motion
this
etherealized
machinery
is
manifest
in
modern
fiction
as
well
as
the
diabolic
constructions
that
wreck
and
ruin
inanimate
objects
have
a
strange
power
in
later
fiction
as
poe
ship
that
is
said
in
certain
seas
to
increase
in
size
as
the
trees
told
of
by
algernon
blackwood
that
grow
in
the
picture
there
are
various
haunted
portraits
as
the
picture
of
dorian
gray
that
bears
on
its
face
the
lines
of
sin
the
living
face
does
not
show
and
whose
hands
are
bloodstained
when
dorian
commits
murder
and
the
painting
told
of
in
de
morgan
likely
that
overhears
a
quarrel
between
an
artist
and
his
wife
the
woman
wrongly
suspecting
her
husband
and
leaving
him
the
picture
relates
the
story
to
a
man
who
has
the
painting
photographed
and
a
copy
sent
to
the
wife
there
is
the
haunted
tapestry
that
is
curiously
related
to
the
living
and
to
the
long
dead
in
poe
another
aspect
of
the
later
as
distinguished
from
the
earlier
occult
literature
is
the
attention
paid
to
ghostly
children
youngsters
are
coming
to
the
front
of
the
stage
everywhere
nowadays
particularly
in
america
so
it
is
but
natural
that
they
should
demand
to
be
heard
as
well
as
seen
in
supernatural
fiction
in
the
gothic
ghosts
i
found
no
individualized
children
and
children

only
twice
in
one
of

here
again
they
are
not

but
are
merely
group
figures
hence
do
not
count
there
is
a
mentioned
in

but
it
is
not
until
more
recent
fiction
that
children

enter

among
the
most
wonderful
of

us
the

the

of
a
little

who
has

to
pray
for
the
unquiet
ghost
of

a
wicked

haunts

the

in
another

of

of

mary
macmillan
speaks
of
the
spirits
of
little

that
are
out

at

than
the
older

ghosts
are

the

of
a

pitifully
slain
centuries
ago
by
her
father
to
save
her
from
torture
who
comes
back
to

with
a

and
the
terrible
of

slain
by

who
comes
back
to
cause
his
death
whom
ellen
glasgow
describes
passing
of
the
spirits
of
children
that
never
were
enter
into
the
late
stories
as
in
by
josephine
daskam
bacon
a
story
of
confused
paranoia
and
supernaturalism
a
woman
grieves
over
the
children
she
never
had
till
they
assume
personality
and
being
for
her
they
become
so
real
that
they
are
finally
seen
by
other
children
who
wish
to
play
with
them
this
reminds
us
of
thomas
bailey
aldrich
imagined
child
miss
mehitabel
son
algernon
blackwood
shows
us
a
multitude
of
baby
spirits
with
reaching
arms
pattering
steps
and
lisping
voices
spirits
of
the
unborn
that
haunt
childless
women
the
room
which
they
enter
seems
sacred
with
the
potentialities
of
motherhood
so
that
a
man
sleeping
there
sees
his
own
dead
mother
return
to
him
among
the
babes
these
ghosts
of
little
children
that
never
were
and
never
may
be
are
like
the
spirits
of
the
yet
to
be
born
children
in
where
in
the
land
of
the
future
the
wait
for
the
angel
to
summon
them
to
life
in
these
stories
associating
children
with
the
ghostly
there
is
always
a
tender
pathos
a
sad
beauty
that
is
appealing
in
blue
the
spectral
insect
or
animal
is
another
innovation
in
recent
fiction
though
there
have
been
occasional
cases
before
as
vergil
the
story
of
the
ghost
of
a
gnat
killed
thoughtlessly
coming
back
to
tell
its
murderer
of
its
sufferings
in
the
insect
hades
robert
chambers
shows
us
several
ghostly
insects
a
death
head
moth
that
is
a
presager
of
disaster
and
a
butterfly
that
brings
a
murderer
to
justice
while
frederick
swanson
in
a
story
makes
a
spectral
insect
a
minister
of
fate
the
most
curdling
example
however
of
the
entomological
supernaturalism
is
richard
marsh
novel
a
modernized
version
of
the
ancient
superstitions
of
egypt
whereby
a
priestess
of

her
mysterious
horrid

as
a
human
being
and
as
a
beetle

mesmeric
magic

over

and
by
its
sensational
furnishes
complicating
terror
to
the
plot
ghost
the
dog
is
frequently
the
subject
of
occult
fiction
more
so
than
any
other
animal
perhaps
because
the
dog
seems
more
nearly
human
than
any
save
possibly
the
horse

appear
as
animals
suited
to
the
personality
of
the

as

and
so
forth
that
adds
a
new
terror
to
death
not
only
are
new
materials
introduced
in
the
later
fiction
of
the
uncanny
but
new
types
are
stressed
in
addition
to
the
weird
stories
told
with
direct
aim
and
art
ghosts
for
ghosts
sake
there
are
tales
where
the
supernatural
element
is
of
secondary
importance
being
used
to
teach
some
truth
or
ridicule
some
fallacy
the
symbolistic
humorous
and
satiric
methods
abound
in
modern
occult
fiction
and
when
well
done
have
a
double
effect
that
of
primary
supernatural
impressiveness
and
in
addition
of
the
subtler
purposes
behind
the
stories
moralized
legends
spiritual
allegories
such
as
hawthorne
wrote
with
consummate
art
have
continued
to
the
present
and
form
a
contrast
to
the
crude
machinery
of
gothic
horrors
the
delicacy
of
suggestion
the
power
of
hinted
ghostliness
though
manifest
in
shakespeare
are
really
modern
achievements
for
no
one
save
him
attained
to
them
in
earlier
art
mystic
poetic
fiction
spiritual
symbolism
appears
in
much
of
the
modern
unearthly
writing
in
certain
cases
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
change
of
old
mythological
stories
into
moral
allegory
the
plays
and
the
stories
of
lord
dunsany
are
peculiarly
symbolic
and
have
the
force
of
antique
mythology
made
instant
and
real
yet
they
have
a
distinctive
touch
all
their
own
for
instance
the
story
of
the
king
who
goes
over
the
world
seeking
his
lost
yesterday
his
dear
past
who
is
told
by
the
weird
keeper
of
the
bygone
years
that
he
can
not
have
it
back
no
not
one
golden
second
has
a
delicate
pathos
of
poetry
when
the
mournful
king
has
gone
back
to
his
palace
a
hoar
harper
comes
who
plays
for
him
and
lo
to
the
strings
of
the
harp
have
clung
the
golden
seconds
of
his
happiest
hours
so
that
he
lives
them
over
again
while
the
music
lasts
book
of
the
tells
symbolic
stories
that
are
poems
in
prose
fantastic
fables
the
creator
is
making
experiments
with
while
the
serpent
the
turtle
and
the
grasshopper
look
on
ask
questions
and
offer
comments
the
serpent
trails
all
through
the
meant
as
stuff
for
artists
and
the
maker
drops
a
tear
in
that
whereof
he
means
to
make
mothers
he
experiments
with
monkeys
trying
to
learn
how
best
to
make
man
and
after
man
is
complete
he
makes
woman
the
stories
of
oscar
wilde
have
some
of
them
a
beauty
like
that
of
some
antique
illuminated
missal
with
its
jeweled
words
its
mystic
figures
wilde
ornate
style
prose
that
trembles
on
the
verge
of
poetry
full
of
passion
and
color
and
light
makes
one
think
of
his
own
words
in
nightingale
and
the
where
the
song
was
builded
of
music
by
moonlight
and
stained
with
his
own
heart
blood
the
delicate
suggestion
of
the
unearthly
the
element
of
suspense
that
gives
the
sense
of
the
supernatural
to
that
which
may
be
mortal
is
seen
in
such
stories
as
dream
of
by
frederick
wedmore
the
ancient
belief
that
the
soul
may
return
to
the
body
within
a
few
days
after
death
forms
the
basis
for
this
in
prose
it
shows
the
soul
on
tiptoe
for
the
unseen
with
a
love
transcending
the
barriers
of
the
grave
revealing
idyllic
sorrow
in
a
father
love
that
denies
death
and
expresses
the
sense
of
expectancy
in
the
hope
of
a
miracle
with
a
beauty
that
is
almost
unbearable
something
of
the
same
theme
of
a
father
waiting
by
his
daughter
grave
to
hear
the
loved
voice
once
more
is
expressed
in
andreyev
story
but
here
there
is
horror
and
remorse
instead
of
holy
love
when
the
father
cries
out
the
silence
that
issues
from
the
grave
is
more
terrible
than
ghostly
sounds
would
be
more
dreadful
in
its
supermortal
suggestion
the
purely
humorous
supernaturalism
is
essentially
a
new
thing
the
old
religious
dramas
had
used
comic
devils
and
peele
ghost
of
jack
is
supposed
to
be
humorous
but
not
at
all
in
the
modern
sense
there
was
nothing
in
early
drama
or
fiction
like
the
rollicking
fun
of
richard
middleton
ghost
ship
or
frank
stockton
spectral
humorists
the
work
of
john
kendrick
bangs
illustrates
the
free
and
easy
manner
of
the
moderns
toward
ghosts
picturing
them
in
unconventional
situations
and
divesting
them
of
all
their
ancient
dignity
he
shows
us
the
wraith
of
the
maiden
who
drowned
herself
in
a
fit
of
pique
for
which
she
is
punished
by
having
to
haunt
the
ancestral
house
as
a
his
spectral
cook
of
bangletop
is
an
original
with
a
villainous
inversion
of
h
who
haunts
an
estate
because
a
medieval
baron
discharged
her
without
wages
his
convivial
spooks
in
their
ghost
club
his
astrals
who
play
pranks
on
mortals
and
their
confrères
are
examples
of
the
modern
flippancy
toward
supernaturals
the
satirical
use
of
supernaturalism
is
also
new
late
literature
laughs
at
everything
with
a
daring
familiarity
undreamed
of
before
save
in
sporadic
cases
the
devil
has
been
an
ancient
subject
for
laughter
but
recent
fiction
ridicules
him
still
more
so
that
we
have
scant
respect
for
him
while
the
ghost
formerly
a
personage
held
in
great
respect
now
comes
in
for
his
share
of
ragging
no
being
is
too
sacred
to
escape
the
light
arrows
of
fun
heaven
is
satirically
exploited
and
angels
saints
and
even
deity
have
become
subjects
for
jesting
conventionalized
with
the
the
tenderfoot
the
irishman
and
so
forth
there
is
a
considerable
body
of
anecdotal
literature
of
the
supernatural
showing
to
what
extent
the
levity
of
treatment
has
gone
various
aspects
of
mortal
life
are
satirized
as
in
inez
haynes
gilmore
which
is
a
campaign
document
for
woman
suffrage
satiric
supernaturalism
is
employed
to
drive
home
many
truths
to
puncture
conceits
of
all
kinds
and
when
well
done
is
effective
for
laughter
is
a
clever
weapon
the
advance
of
the
later
supernatural
fiction
over
the
earlier
is
nowhere
seen
more
distinctly
than
in
the
increased
effectiveness
with
which
it
manages
the
mechanics
of
emotion
its
skill
in
selecting
and
elaborating
the
details
by
which
terror
and
awe
are
produced
the
artist
of
the
uncanny
knows
how
to
strike
the
varied
tones
of
supernaturalism
the
shrill
notes
of
fear
the
deep
diapason
of
awe
the
crashing
chords
of
horror
the
skillful
writer
chooses
with
utmost
care
the
seemingly
trivial
details
that
go
to
make
up
the
atmosphere
of
the
unearthly
shakespeare
was
a
master
of
that
but
none
other
of
his
time
the
knocking
at
the
gate
in
for
instance
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
employment
of
a
natural
incident
to
produce
an
effect
of
the
supernatural
as
de
quincey
has
pointed
out
in
his
essay
on
the
subject
the
gothic
novel
relied
largely
for
its
impressiveness
on
emphasizing
ghostly
scenes
by
representing
aspects
of
weather
to
harmonize
with
the
emotions
of
the
characters
this
was
overworked
in
terror
fiction
and
while
it
still
possesses
power
it
is
a
much
less
common
method
of
technique
than
it
used
to
be
poe
introductory
paragraph
in
fall
of
the
house
of
is
a
notable
example
of
skill
in
creating
atmosphere
of
the
supernatural
by
various
details
including
phenomena
of
weather
and
hardy
shows
special
power
in
harmonizing
nature
to
the
moods
and
purposes
of
his
characters
yet
many
a
modern
story
produces
a
profound
sense
of
awe
and
purges
the
soul
by
means
of
terror
with
no
reference
at
all
to
foreboding
weather
however
the
allusions
now
made
are
more
skillful
and
show
more
selective
power
than
of
old
gothic
fiction
had
much
to
say
of
melancholy
birds
that
circled
portentously
over
ancient
castles
filled
with
gloom
and
ghosts
but
they
were
generic
and
not
individual
specimens
the
fowl
was
always
spoken
of
as
a
bird
of
prey
a
night
bird
a
bat
an
owl
or
by
some
such
vague
term
natural
history
has
become
more
generally
known
since
those
times
and
writers
of
introduce
their
ominous
birds
with
more
definiteness
and
appropriateness
the
repulsive
bat
that
clings
to
the
window
ledge
in
bram
stoker
novel
is
a
vampire
a
symbol
of
the
whole
horrible
situation
as
the
kite
that
soars
menacingly
overhead
in
another
of
his
novels
is
individualized
and
becomes
a
definite
thing
of
terror
poe
raven
is
vastly
more
a
bird
of
evil
than
any
specimen
in
the
gothic
aviary
robert
chambers
brings
in
a
cormorant
several
times
as
a
portent
of
ghostly
disaster
particularly
foreboding
when
it
turns
toward
the
land
on
the
dark
glistening
cliffs
silhouetted
against
the
glare
of
the
sea
sat
a
cormorant
black
motionless
its
horrible
head
raised
toward
heaven
there
is
in
recent
fiction
no
bird
more
dreadful
in
import
than
the
belled
buzzard
that
irvin
cobb
makes
the
leading
figure
in
his
story
by
that
name
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
use
of
the
natural
to
produce
terror
and
awe
for
the
murderer
sees
in
the
bird
a
minister
of
fate
and
the
faint
tinkle
of
its
bell
as
it
soars
over
the
marsh
where
the
body
lies
buried
paralyzes
him
with
horror
at
last
he
can
bear
no
more
and
hearing
it
as
he
thinks
close
at
hand
he
shrieks
out
his
confession
only
to
find
this
time
that
it
is
not
the
belled
buzzard
at
all
that
he
hears
but
only
an
old
cowbell
that
a
little
negro
child

picked
up
in
the
barnyard
robert
chambers
in
his
early
stories
contrives
to
give
varying
supernatural
effects
by
descriptions
of
shadows
as
symbolic
of
life
and
character
he
speaks
of
shadows
of
spirits
or
of
persons
fated
to
disaster
as
white
again
his
supernatural
shadows
may
be
gray
gray
is
a
favored
shade
for
ghostly
effect
whether
for
witches
or
for
phantoms
and
sometimes
they
are
perfectly
black
to
indicate
differing
conditions
of
destiny
has
a
strange
little
allegory
magic
and
other
writers
have
used
similar
methods
to
produce
uncanny
effects
the
gothic
romance
made
much
use
of
portents
of
the
supernatural
which
later
fiction
does
as
well
but
differently
and
with
greater
skill
the
modern
stories
for
the
most
part
abandon
the
conventional
portents
the
dear
old
clock
forever
striking
twelve
or
one
there
was
no
gothic
castle
so
impoverished
as
to
lack
such
ghostly
horologue
the
abbey
bell
that
tolls
at
touch
of
spirit
hands
or
wizard
winds
the
statuesque
the
fire
that
burns
blue
at
approach
of
a
specter
and
so
forth
the
later
story
is
more
selective
in
its
aids
to
ghostly
effect
and
adapts
the
means
desired
to
each
particular
case
so
that
it
hits
the
mark
for
instance
the
sardonic
laughter
that
sounds
as
the
burglars
are
cracking
the
gate
of
heaven
to
get
in
and
imagining
what
they
will
find
is
prophetic
of
the
emptiness
the
nothingness
that
meets
their
astounded
gaze
when
they
are
within
ambrose
bierce
in
some
of
his
stories
describes
the
repulsiveness
of
the
fleshly
corpse
reanimated
by
the
spirit
perhaps
not
the
spirit
belonging
to
it
with
a
loathly
effect
more
awful
than
any
purely
psychic
phantom
could
produce
which
reminds
us
somewhat
of
the
corpse

to
life
in

lovell
beddoes
jest
the
horrors
of
invisibility
in
modern
fiction
avail
to
give
a
ghastly
chill
to
the
soul
that
visible
apparitions
rarely
impart
likewise
the
effect
of
mystery
of
the
incalculable
element
in
giving
an
impression
of
supernaturalism
is
a
recognized
method
of
technique
in
many
stories
as
the
minister
black
veil
in
hawthorne
symbolic
story
the
unspeakable
revolting
suggestion
in
edith
wharton
where
a
man
is
haunted
by
two
hideous
eyes
that
have
the
physical
effect
of
a
bad
smell
whose
look
left
a
smear
like
a
snail
is
built
up
with
uncommon
art
we
do
not
realize
how
much
is
due
to
insanity
and
how
much
to
the
supernatural
when
after
telling
the
story
of
his
obsession
his
fears
that
as
a
climax
he
will
become
like
those
eyes
the
man
suddenly
sees
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
and
meets
their
dreadful
gaze
he
and
the
image
confronted
each
other
with
a
glare
of
slowly
gathering
hate
mention
might
be
made
of
an
incident
in
a
recently
published
literary
drama
where
a
man
seeks
over
the
world
for
the
unknown
woman
with
whom
he
has
fallen
in
love
and
on
his
calling
aloud
in
question
as
to
who
she
is
the
grave
with
lips
replied
is
i
death
these
are
only
suggestions
of
numberless
instances
that
might
be
given
of
a
modern
technique
of
supernaturalism
that
surpasses
anything
in
gothic
fiction
the
effectiveness
of
modern
ghostly
stories
is
aided
by
the
suggestiveness
of
the
unearthly
given
by
the
use
of
sensitives
animals
or
persons
that
are
peculiarly
alert
to
the
occult
impressions
we
see
in
many
stories
that
children
perceive
the
supernatural
presences
more
quickly
than
adults
as
in
oliphant
story
of
the
ghost
returning
to
right
a
wrong
trying
strenuously
to
make
herself
known
to
the
grown
person
and
realized
only
by
a
little
child
in
belasco
play
the
little
boy
is
the
first
and
for
a
long
time
the
only
one
to
sense
the
return
of
peter
grimm
in
maeterlinck
the
baby
in
arms
is
aware
of
the
unearthly
presences
better
than
the
men
and
women
sometimes
the
sensitive
is
a
blind
person
as
the
old
grandfather
in
another
of
maeterlinck
short
plays
who
is
conscious
of
the
approaching
death
before
any
of
the
others
or
blind
anna
in
drama
dead
animals
are
quick
to
perceive
supernatural
manifestations
cats
in
fiction
are
shown
as
being
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
ghosts
perhaps
because
of
their
uncanny
alliance
with
witches
while
dogs
and
horses
go
wild
with
fear
this
is
noticed
in
many
stories
as
in
story
of
the
haunted
house
where
the
dog
dies
of
terror
in
the
face
of
the
ghostly
phenomena
the
psychic
doctor
told
of
in
blackwood
uncanny
stories
who
goes
to
a
house
possessed
by
evil
spirits
takes
with
him
a
cat
and
a
dog
which
by
their
difference
of
action
reveal
to
him
the
presence
of
the
spirits
long
before
they
are
visualized
for
him
in
general
there
is
more
power
of
suggestion
in
the
later
ghostly
stories
than
in
the
earlier
the
art
is
more
subtle
the
technique
more
skillfully
studied
more
artfully
accidental
there
is
in
modern
fiction
notably
the
work
of
poe
and
that
of
many
recent
writers
russian
french
and
german
as
well
as
english
a
type
of
supernaturalism
that
is
closely
associated
with
insanity
one
may
not
tell
just
where
the
line
is
drawn
just
how
much
of
the
element
of
the
uncanny
is
the
result
of
the
broodings
of
an
unbalanced
brain
and
how
much
is
real
ghostliness
poe
studies
of
madness
verge
on
the
unearthly
as
do
maupassant
hoffmann
and
others
josephine
daskam
bacon
illustrates
this
genre
in
a
recent
volume
of
stories
strange
cases
of
the
plots
centering
round
instances
of
paranoia
occurring
in
the
practice
of
a
famous
alienist
yet
they
are
paranoia
one
instance
is
of
a
young
girl
who
is
haunted
by
the
ghost
of
a
nurse
who
has
died
because
given
the
wrong
medicine
by
mistake
she
is
on
the
of
insanity
when
her
lover
cries
aloud
that
he
would
take
the
curse
on
himself
for
her
if
he
could
which
by
some
unknown
psychic
law
does
effect
a
transference
which
frees
her
and
obsesses
him
another
is
that
of
a
man
in
the
insane
asylum
who
recognizes
in
a
mysterious
housekeeper
the
spirit
of
his
wife
who
comes
from
the
grave
to
keep
him
company
and
vanishes
on
the
day
of
his
death
these
are
curious
analyses
of
the
in
its
effect
on
the
human
mind
of
insanity
as
a
cause
or
effect
of
the
supernatural
barry
pain
is
a
recent
example
a
story
of
a
man
whose
madness
carries
him
to
another
planet
showing
him
inverted
aspects
of
life
where
emotions
are
the
only
real
things
all
else
but
shadows
du
maurier
pathetic
novel
portraying
the
passion
and
anguish
and
joy
of
peter
ibbetson
that
touches
the
thin
line
between
sanity
and
madness
showing
in
his
a
power
to
relive
the
past
and
even
to
live
someone
else
life
is
a
striking
example
one
interesting
aspect
of
that
story
is
the
point
where
the
spirit
of
mary
changes
from
the
of
to
the
ghost
of
the
woman
of
since
she
has
died
and
can
no
more
come
to
her
lover
as
she
once
did
but
must
come
as
her
own
phantom
there
are
extraordinary
effects
of
insanity
associated
with
the
supernatural
in
the
work
of
ambrose
bierce
of
arthur
machen
and
others
of
the
modern
school
italian
literature
shows
some
significant
instances
in
fogazzaro
and
mattino
di
as
lord
dunsany
says
of
it
who
can
say
of
insanity
whether
it
be
divine
or
of
the
pit
we
have
noticed
in
preceding
chapters
two
aspects
of
modern
supernaturalism
as
distinguished
from
the
gothic
the
giving
of
cumulative
and
more
terrible
power
to
ghostly
beings
and
on
the
other
hand
the
leveling
influence
that
makes
them
more
human
the
access
of
horror
and
unearthly
force
as
shown
in
the
characters
described
by
certain
writers
is
significant
in
the
work
of
bierce
machen
blackwood
stoker
and
others
supernaturalism
is
raised
to
the
nth
power
and
every
possible
thrill
is
employed
the
carrion
ghosts
of
bierce
animated
by
malignant
foreign
spirits
surpass
the
charnel
shudders
produced
by
the
gothic
algernon
blackwood
psychic
invasions
where
localities
rather
than
mere
apartments
or
houses
alone
are
haunted
diabolized
by
undying
evil
influences
with
compound
power
his
elementals
that
control
the
forces
of
wind
and
wave
and
fire
to
work
their
demon
will
are
unlike
anything
that
the
early
terror
novel
conceived
of
horace
walpole
and
radcliffe
knew
no
thrills
like
those
of
bram
stoker
count
dracula
who
is
an
immemorial
evil
a
vampire
and
werewolf
as
well
as
man
with
power
to
change
himself
into
a
vampire
bat
or
animal
of
prey
at
will
by
josephine
daskam
bacon
is
more
horrific
than
any
mere
revenge
ghost
however
much
it
shrieked
vindicta
the
diabolism
in
arthur
work
reeks
obscurely
of
a
pit
more
horrible
than
epic
or
drama
has
portrayed
in
general
many
of
the
later
ghostly
characters
are
more
complex
more
intense
in
evil
than
the
gothic
while
it
is
true
that
certain
writers
show
a
tendency
to
create
supernatural
characters
having
an
excess
of
evil
power
beyond
the
previous
uncanny
beings
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
equally
strong
and
significant
tendency
to
reduce
the
ghostly
beings
nearer
to
the
human
fiction
here
as
frequently
seems
ahead
of
general
belief
and
refuses
to
believe
in
the
altogether
evil
ghosts
angels
witches
devils
werewolves
and
so
forth
are
now
made
more
human
more
like
to
man
yet
without
losing
any
of
their
ancient
power
to
thrill
ghosts
in
late
literature
have
more
of
the
mortal
characteristics
than
ever
before
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
a
previous
chapter
they
look
more
human
more
normal
they
are
clad
in
everyday
garments
of
varied
colors
from
red
shirts
and
khaki
to
though
gray
seems
the
favored
shade
for
shades
as
well
as
witches
and
they
have
lost
that
look
of
pallor
that
distinguished
early
phantoms
now
they
are
more
than
merely
vaporous
projections
as
they
used
to
be
more
than
merely
phantasmogenetic
apparitions
but
are
healthy
spooks
they
are
not
as
their
ancestors
were
but
are
very
chatty
giving
forth
views
on
everything
they
are
interested
in
from
socialism
to
the
present
war
and
their
range
of
interests
has
widened
immeasurably
it
would
seem
that
the
literacy
test
has
been
applied
to
ghosts
in
recent
fiction
modern
specters
are
so
normal
in
appearance
that
often
no
one
recognizes
them
as
ghosts
as
in
edith
story
where
the
peculiar
thing
about
the
apparition
haunting
a
certain
house
is
that
it
is
not
till
long
afterwards
that
one
knows
it
was
a
ghost
the
man
in
the
gray
suit
whom
the
wife
thinks
a
chance
caller
is
the
spirit
of
a
man
not
yet
dead
a
terrible
living
who
finally
takes
his
victim
mysteriously
away
with
him
modern
ghosts
have
both
motions
and
emotions
like
men
hence
mortals
are
coming
to
regard
them
more
sympathetically
to
have
more
of
a
for
them
likewise
the
angels
are
now
only
a
very
little
higher
if
any
than
men
seraphs
are
democratic
and
angels
have
developed
a
sense
of
humor
that
renders
them
more
interesting
than
they
used
to
be
the
winged
being
that
wells
vicar
goes
gunning
for
is
a
charming
youth
with
a
naïve
satire
as
the
angels
in
mark
twain
story
of
heaven
are
realistically
mortal
and
masculine
in
tastes
they
care
little
for
harps
and
crowns
grow
fidgety
under
excess
of
rest
and
engage
in
all
sorts
of
activities
retaining
their
individual
tastes
james
stephens
archangel
seraph
and
cherub
are
chatty
cordial
souls
with
an
avidity
for
cold
potatoes
and
irish
companionship
the
demons
as
well
have
felt
the
same
leveling
influence
experienced
by
the
ghosts
and
the
angels
only
in
their
case
the
thing
is
reversed
and
they
are
raised
to
the
grade
of
humanity
we
are
coming
to
see
in
modern
fiction
at
least
that
the
devil
is
not
really
black
only
a
pleasant
mottled
gray
like
ourselves
satan
in
mark
posthumous
novel
is
an
affable
young
fellow
claiming
to
be
the
nephew
and
namesake
of

name
bernard
shaw
devil
is
of
a
chesterfieldian
courtesy
willing
to
speed
the
parting
as
to
welcome
the
coming
guest
i
have
found
no
comic
use
of
the
werewolf
or
of
the
vampire
though
there
are
several
comic
witch
stories
yet
all
these
personages
are
humanized
in
modern
fiction
we
feel
in
some
recent
supernatural
stories
a
sense
of
a
continuing
current
of
life
these
ghosts
devils
witches
angels
and
so
forth
are
too
real
to
be
cut
short
by
an
author
mysterious
another
aspect
of
the
leveling
influence
is
seen
in
the
more
than
natural
power
of
motion
feeling
and
intelligence
given
to
inanimate
objects
machinery
plants
and
animals
in
late
literature
the
idea
of
endowing
inanimate
figures
with
life
and
personality
is
seen
several
times
in
hawthorne
stories
as
his
snow
image
drowne
wooden
image
the
vivified
scarecrow
feathertop
that
the
witch
makes
the
clay
figures
that
satan
in
mark
twain
novel
models
endues
with
life
then
destroys
with
the
fine
casual
carelessness
of
a
god
remind
one
of
an
incident
from
mythology
the
statue
in
edith
wharton
duchess
at
that
changes
its
expression
showing
on
its
marble
face
through
a
century
the
loathing
and
horror
that
the
living
countenance
wore
or
lord
dunsany
jade
idol
that
comes
with
stony
steps
across
the
desolate
moor
to
exact
vengeance
on
four
men
helpless
in
its
presence
has
a
more
intense
thrill
than
otranto
peripatetic
statue
lord
dunsany
gods
of
the
of
which
frank
harris
says
it
is
the
only
play
which
has
meant
anything
to
me
in
twenty
years
shows
an
inexorable
fatality
as
in
the
greek
drama
in
night
at
an
science
is
revealing
wonderful
facts
and
fiction
is
quick
to
realize
the
possibilities
for
startling
situations
in
every
field
so
diabolic
botanical
specimens
animals
endowed
with
human
or
more
than
human
craft
sometimes
gifted
with
immortality
as
well
add
a
new
interest
to
uncanny
fiction
and
the
new
machines
that
make
all
impossibilities
come
to
pass
inspire
a
significant
class
of
supernatural
stories
in
general
a
new
force
is
given
to
all
things
to
raise
them
to
the
level
of
the
human
in
the
same
way
nature
is
given
a
new
power
and
becomes
equal
sometimes
far
his
superior
in
thought
and
action
the
maelstrom
in
poe
story
is
more
than
merely
a
part
of
the
setting
it
is
a
terrible
force
in
action
algernon
blackwood
stresses
this
variously
in
his
stories
as
where
egypt
is
shown
as
a
vital
presence
and
power
or
where
the
goblin
trees
are
as
awful
as
any
of
the
other
characters
of
evil
or
in
the
wind
and
flame
on
the
mountain
that
are
elements
of
supernatural
power
with
a
resistless
lure
for
mortals
or
in
the
vampire
soil
that
steals
a
man
strength
this
may
be
illustrated
as
well
from
the
drama
as
in
maeterlinck
where
death
is
the
silent
invisible
yet
dominant
force
or
in
synge
where
the
sea
is
a
terrible
foe
lying
in
wait
for
man
or
in
august
daughter
of
the
where
the
moor
is
a
compelling
character
of
evil
gothic
fiction
did
associate
the
phenomena
of
nature
with
the
moods
of
the
action
yet
in
a
less
effective
way
the
aspects
of
nature
in
recent
literature
have
been
raised
to
the
level
of
humanity
becoming
mortal
or
else
diabolic
or
divine
in
general
in
modern
fiction
man
now
makes
his
supernatural
characters
in
his
own
image
ghosts
angels
devils
witches
werewolves
are
humanized
made
like
to
man
in
appearance
passions
and
powers
on
the
other
hand
plants
inanimate
objects
and
animals
as
well
as
the
phenomena
of
nature
are
raised
to
the
human
plane
and
given
access
of
power
this
leveling
process
democratizes
the
supernatural
elements
and
tends
to
make
them
almost
equal
the
present
revival
of
interest
in
the
supernatural
and
its
appearance
in
literature
are
as
marked
in
the
drama
as
in
fiction
or
poetry
whitmore
in
a
recently
published
volume
on
supernatural
in
has
ably
treated
the
subject
especially
in
the
greek
classic
period
and
the
elizabethan
age
in
england
his
thesis
is
that
the
supernatural
is
most
frequently
associated
with
tragedy
and
is
found
where
tragedy
is
at
its
best
this
may
be
true
of
earlier
periods
of
the
tragic
drama
yet
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
make
the
assertion
of
the
drama
of
the
present
time
the
occult
makes
its
appearance
to
a
considerable
extent
now
in
melodrama
and
even
in
comedy
though
with
no
decrease
in
the
frequency
and
effectiveness
of
its
use
in
tragedy
this
only
illustrates
the
widening
of
its
sphere
and
its
adaptability
to
varying
forms
of
art
a
brief
survey
of
some
of
the
plays
produced
in
the
last
few
years
most
of
them
being
seen
in
new
york
will
illustrate
the
extent
to
which
the
ghostly
motifs
are
used
on
the
stage
of
double
personality
is
represented
by
edward
locke
in
a
play
which
is
said
by
critics
to
be
virtually
a
dramatization
of
morton
prince
study
where
psychological
apparatus
used
in
laboratory
experiments
to
expel
the
evil
intruder
from
the
girl
a
chronoscope
a
dynograph
revolving
mirrors
make
the
setting
seem
truly
psychical
but
the
most
dramatic
instance
of
the
kind
of
course
is
the
dramatization
of
jekyll
alter
ego
in
case
of
disassociation
of
a
the
plays
of
charles
rann
kennedy
and
jerome
jerome
are
akin
to
the
old
mystery
plays
in
that
they
personate
divinity
and
show
the
miracle
of
christly
influence
on
sinful
hearts
augustus
thomas
and
edward
milton
royle
introduce
hypnotism
as
the
basis
of
complication
and
denouement
supernatural
healing
miraculous
intervention
of
divine
power
occur
in
plays
by
william
vaughan
moody
björnson
and
george
m
cohan
another
turns
on
converse
with
spirits
as
does
belasco
of
peter
while
a
war
play
by
vida
sutton
shows
four
ghosts
on
the
stage
at
once
astonishing
phantoms
who
do
not
realize
that
they
are
dead
others
have
for
their
themes
miracles
of
faith
and
rescue
from
danger
though
the
play
satirizes
such
belief
and
the
latter
is
a
piece
of
catholic
propaganda
servant
in
the
passing
of
the
third
floor
in
witching
in
unwritten
faith
their
miracle
as
eternal
by
george
jean
nathan
and
by
chesterton
introduces
supernatural
forces
whereby
strange
things
are
made
to
happen
such
as
the
changing
of
the
electric
light
from
green
to
blue
the
dramatization
of
du
maurier
novel
shows
and
various
other
psychic
effects
in
a
delicate
and
distinctive
manner
and
willow
by
benrimo
and
harrison
rhodes
is
built
upon
an
ancient
japanese
legend
relating
a
hamadryad
myth
with
other
supermortal
phantasies
such
as
representing
a
woman
soul
as
contained
in
a
mirror
we
have
fairy
plays
by
barrie
yeats
and
maeterlinck
and
the
mermaid
has
even
been
staged
bernard
shaw
shows
us
the
devil
in
his
own
home
town
while
hauptmann
gives
us
hannele
visions
of
heaven
the
frankenstein
theme
is
used
to
provoke
laughter
mixed
with
thrills
owen
and
robert
davis
symbolize
man
better
angel
while
eternal
a
shows
another
piece
of
symbolic
supernaturalism
lord
dunsany
plays
have
already
been
mentioned
land
of
heart
blue
in
last
by
paul
dickey
and
charles
goddard
in
yet
the
drama
though
showing
a
definite
revival
of
the
supernatural
and
illustrating
various
forms
of
it
is
more
restricted
than
fiction
many
aspects
of
the
occult
appear
and
the
psychic
drama
is
popular
but
the
necessities
of
presentation
on
the
stage
inevitably
bar
many
forms
of
the
ghostly
art
that
take
their
place
naturally
in
fiction
the
closet
drama
does
not
come
under
this
limitation
for
in
effect
it
is
almost
as
free
as
fiction
to
introduce
mystical
symbolic
and
invisible
presences
the
closet
drama
is
usually
in
poetic
form
and
poetry
is
closer
akin
to
certain
forms
of
the
supernatural
than
is
prose
which
makes
their
use
more
natural
the
literary
playlet
so
popular
just
now
uses
the
ghostly
in
many
ways
one
shows
the
archangel
raphael
with
his
dog
working
miracles
while
another
includes
in
its
a
faun
and
a
moon
goddess
who
insists
on
giving
the
faun
a
soul
at
which
he
wildly
protests
as
through
suffering
and
human
pain
he
accepts
the
gift
a
symbolic
white
butterfly
poises
itself
on
his
uplifted
hand
then
flits
toward
heaven
in
another
padraic
yields
himself
to
the
fairies
power
as
the
price
of
bread
for
the
girl
he
loves
theodore
dreiser
short
plays
bring
in
creatures
impossible
of
representation
on
the
stage
persistences
of
fish
animals
and
birds
symbolic
shadows
a
blue
sphere
a
power
of
physics
nitrous
acid
a
fast
mail
though
trains
have
been
used
on
the
stage
and
so
forth
instances
from
recent
german
drama
might
be
given
as
the
work
of
august
stramm
who
like
rupert
brooke
and
the
poets
of
the
irish
revolution
has
fallen
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
war
an
article
in
the
says
of
stramm
that
he
felt
behind
all
the
beauty
of
the
world
its
elemental
passions
and
believed
these
to
be
the
projections
of
human
passions
in
the
waves
of
wind
and
light
and
water
in
flames
of
earth
he
includes
among
his
characters
a
spider
nightingales
moonlight
wind
and
blossoms
carl
hauptmann
likewise
shows
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
and
of
on
the
battlefield
of
death
the
dead
arise
to
join
in
one
dreadful
chant
of
hate
against
their
enemies
in
in
dead
are
leonid
andreyev
striking
play
might
be
mentioned
as
an
example
from
the
russian
death
and
old
time
are
the
principal
actors
while
the
human
beings
are
all
deformed
and
distorted
one
continuous
malicious
monstrosity
bearing
only
a
remote
likeness
to
man
the
starving
men
are
slain
but
over
the
field
of
the
dead
the
motionless
figure
of
death
is
seen
silhouetted
but
the
dead
arise
and
a
dull
distant
manifold
murmur
as
if
underground
is
heard
we
come
woe
unto
the
victorious
but
as
i
have
said
these
are
literary
dramas
impossible
of
presentation
on
the
stage
so
that
they
are
judged
by
literary
rather
than
dramatic
standards
for
the
most
part
fiction
is
infinitely
freer
in
its
range
and
choice
of
subjects
from
the
supernatural
than
is
the
drama
the
suggestive
symbolic
mystic
effects
which
could
not
in
any
way
be
presented
on
the
stage
but
which
are
more
truly
of
the
province
of
poetry
are
used
in
prose
that
has
a
jeweled
beauty
and
a
melody
as
of
poetry
elements
such
as
invisibility
for
instance
and
various
occult
agencies
may
be
stressed
and
analyzed
in
fiction
as
would
be
impossible
on
the
stage
the
close
relation
between
insanity
and
the
weird
can
be
much
more
effectively
shown
in
the
novel
or
short
story
than
in
the
drama
as
the
forces
of
mystery
the
incalculable
agencies
can
be
thus
better
emphasized
ghosts
need
to
be
seen
on
the
stage
to
have
the
best
effect
even
if
they
are
meant
as
selective
apparitions
like
banquo
and
if
thus
seen
they
are
too
corporeal
for
the
most
impressive
influence
while
in
fiction
they
can
be
suggested
with
delicate
reserve
supernatural
presences
that
could
not
be
imaged
on
the
boards
may
be
represented
in
the
novel
or
story
as
elementals
or
psychic
invasions
how
could
one
stage
such
action
for
instance
as
his
citizens
turning
into
or
his
giant
devil
looming
mightily
in
the
heavens
likewise
in
fiction
the
full
presentation
of
scientific
supernaturalism
can
be
achieved
which
would
be
impossible
on
the
stage
in
conclusion
it
might
be
said
that
fiction
offers
the
most
popular
present
vehicle
for
expression
of
the
undoubtedly
reviving
supernaturalism
in
english
literature
and
fiction
is
likewise
the
best
form
that
which
affords
the
more
varied
chances
for
effectiveness
the
rising
tide
of
the
unearthly
in
art
shows
itself
in
all
literary
forms
as
dramatic
narrative
and
lyric
poetry
with
a
few
epics
in
the
playlet
as
in
the
standard
drama
in
the
short
story
as
in
the
novel
it
manifests
itself
in
countless
ways
in
current
literature
and
inviting
lines
of
investigation
suggest
themselves
with
reference
to
various
aspects
of
its
study
the
supernatural
as
especially
related
to
religion
offers
an
interesting
field
for
research
the
miracles
from
the
bible
are
often
used
as
in
lew
wallace
and
christ
is
introduced
in
other
times
and
places
as
the
war
novel
or
in
marie
corelli
satire
on
episcopacy
where
the
cardinal
finds
the
christ
child
outside
the
cathedral
the
more
than
mortal
elements
as
answers
to
prayer
the
experience
of
conversion
spiritual
miracles
and
so
forth
are
present
to
a
considerable
extent
in
modern
fiction
two
very
recent
novels
of
importance
base
their
plots
on
the
miraculous
in
religion
brook
by
george
moore
and
by
william
dean
howells
i
have
touched
on
this
aspect
of
the
subject
in
a
previous
article
second
master
religion
in
recent
american
novels
in
the
january
and
one
might
profitably
trace
out
the
appearances
of
the
ghostly
in
modern
poetry
or
one
might
study
its
manifestations
in
the
late
drama
including
melodrama
and
comedy
as
well
as
tragedy
this
present
treatment
of
the
supernatural
in
modern
english
fiction
makes
no
pretensions
to
being
complete
it
is
meant
to
be
suggestive
rather
than
exhaustive
and
i
shall
be
gratified
if
it
may
help
to
arouse
further
interest
in
a
significant
and
vital
phase
of
our
literature
