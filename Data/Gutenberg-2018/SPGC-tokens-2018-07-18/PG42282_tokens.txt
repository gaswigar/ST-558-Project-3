preface
this
book
is
the
result
of
beaver
studies
which
cover
a
period
of
years
during
these
years
i
have
rambled
through
every
state
in
the
union
and
visited
mexico
canada
and
alaska
in
the
course
of
these
rambles
notice
was
taken
of
trees
birds
flowers
glaciers
and
bears
and
studious
attention
devoted
to
the
beaver
no
opportunity
for
beaver
study
was
missed
and
many
a
long
journey
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
the
conditions
in
live
colonies
or
in
making
measurements
in
the
ruins
of
old
ones
these
investigations
were
made
during
every
season
of
the
year
and
often
a
week
was
spent
in
one
colony
i
have
seen
beaver
at
work
scores
of
times
and
on
a
few
occasions
dozens
at
one
time
beaver
have
been
my
neighbors
since
i
was
a
boy
at
any
time
during
the
past
years
i
could
go
from
my
cabin
on
the
slope
of
long
peak
colorado
to
a
number
of
colonies
within
fifteen
minutes
studies
were
carried
on
in
these
colonies
in
spring
summer
autumn
and
winter
one
autumn
my
entire
time
was
spent
in
making
observations
and
watching
the
activities
of
beaver
in
fourteen
colonies
days
in
succession
i
visited
these
colonies
three
of
them
twice
daily
these
daily
investigations
enabled
me
to
see
the
preparations
for
winter
from
beginning
to
end
they
also
enabled
me
to
understand
details
which
with
infrequent
visits
i
could
not
have
even
discovered
during
this
autumn
i
saw
two
houses
built
and
a
number
of
old
ones
repaired
and
plastered
i
also
saw
the
digging
of
one
canal
the
repairing
of
a
number
of
old
dams
and
the
building
of
two
new
ones
in
three
of
these
colonies
i
tallied
each
day
the
additional
number
of
trees
cut
for
harvest
i
saw
many
trees
felled
and
noted
the
manner
in
which
they
were
moved
by
land
and
floated
by
water
the
greater
number
of
the
papers
in
this
book
were
written
especially
for
it
parts
of
the
others
have
been
used
in
my
books

beaver
works
are
of
economical
and
educational
value
besides
adding
a
charm
to
the
wilds
the
beaver
is
a
persistent
practicer
of
conservation
and
should
not
perish
from
the
hills
and
mountains
of
our
land
altogether
the
beaver
has
so
many
interesting
ways
is
so
useful
skillful
practical
and
picturesque
that
his
life
and
his
deeds
deserve
a
larger

working
like
a
beaver
one
september
day
i
saw
a
number
of
beaver
at
work
upon
a
house
one
part
of
the
house
had
been
carried
up
about
two
feet
above
the
water
and
against
this
were
leaned
numerous
sticks
which
stood
upon
the
top
of
the
foundation
just
above
after
these
sticks
were
arranged
they
were
covered
with
turf
and
mud
which
the
beaver
scooped
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
in
bringing
this
earth
covering
up
the
beaver
invariably
came
out
of
the
water
at
a
given
point
and
over
a
short
slide
worn
on
the
side
of
the
house
climbed
up
to
the
height
where
they
were
to
deposit
their
load
which
was
carried
in
the
fore
paws
then
they
edged
round
and
put
the
upon
the
house
from
this
point
they
descended
directly
to
the
water
but
when
they
emerged
with
the
next
handful
they
came
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
slide
and
again
climbed
up
it
the
beaver
often
does
a
large
amount
of
work
in
a
short
time
a
small
dam
may
be
built
up
in
a
few
nights
or
a
number
of
trees
felled
or
possibly
a
long
burrow
or
tunnel
clawed
in
the
earth
during
a
brief
period
in
most
cases
however
beaver
works
of
magnitude
are
monuments
of
old
days
and
have
required
a
long
time
to
construct
being
probably
the
work
of
more
than
one
generation
it
is
rare
for
a
large
dam
or
canal
to
be
constructed
in
one
season
a
thousand
feet
of
dam
is
the
accumulated
work
of
years
an
aged
beaver
may
have
lived
all
his
life
in
one
locality
born
in
the
house
in
which
his
parents
were
born
and
he
might
rise
upon
the
dam
which
held
his
pond
and
say
my
grandparents
half
a
dozen
centuries
ago
commenced
this
dam
and
i
do
not
know
which
one
of
my
ancestors
completed
it
although
the
beaver
is
a
tireless
and
an
effective
worker
he
does
not
work
unless
there
is
need
to
do
so
usually
his
summer
is
a
rambling
vacation
spent
away
from
home
his
longest
period
of
labor
is
during
september
and
october
when
the
harvest
is
gathered
and
general
preparations
made
for
the
long
winter
baby
beavers
take
part
in
the
though
probably
without
accomplishing
very
much
during
most
winters
he
has
weeks
of
routine
in
the
house
and
ponds
with
nothing
urgent
to
do
except
sleep
and
eat
he
works
not
only
tooth
and
nail
but
tooth
and
tail
the
tail
is
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
organs
of
the
beaver
volumes
have
been
written
concerning
it
it
is
nearly
flat
is
black
in
color
and
is
a
convenient
and
appendage
it
serves
for
a
rudder
a
stool
a
prop
a
scull
and
a
signal
club
it
may
be
used
for
a
trowel
but
i
have
never
seen
it
so
used
it
serves
one
purpose
that
apparently
has
not
been
discussed
in
print
on
a
few
occasions
i
have
seen
a
beaver
carry
a
small
daub
of
mud
or
some
sticks
clasped
between
the
tail
and
the
belly
it
gives
this
awkward
animal
increased
awkwardness
and
even
an
uncouth
appearance
to
see
him
humped
up
with
tail
tucked
between
his
legs
in
order
to
clasp
something
between
it
and
his
belly
he
is
accomplished
in
the
use
of
arms
and
hands
with
hands
he
is
able
to
hold
sticks
and
handle
them
with
great
dexterity
like
any
clawing
animal
he
uses
his
hands
or
fore
paws
to
dig
holes
or
tunnels
and
to
excavate
burrows
and
his
hind
feet
are
the
chief
propelling
power
in
swimming
although
the
tail
which
may
be
turned
almost
on
edge
and
is
capable
of
diagonal
movement
is
sometimes
brought
into
play
as
a
scull
when
the
beaver
is
at
his
swiftest
in
the
water
beaver
move
about
freely
and
apparently
with
the
greatest
enjoyment
they
are
delightfully
swift
and
agile
swimmers
in
decided
contrast
with
their
awkward
slowness
upon
the
ground
they
can
swim
two
hundred
yards
under
water
without
once
coming
to
the
surface
and
have
the
ability
to
remain
under
water
from
five
to
ten
minutes
on
one
occasion
a
beaver
remained
under
water
longer
than
eleven
minutes
and
came
to
the
top
none
the
worse
apparently
for
this
long
period
of
suspended
breathing
it
is
in
standing
erect
that
the
beaver
is
at
his
best
in
this
attitude
the
awkwardness
and
the
dull
appearance
of
are
absent
and
he
is
a
statue
of
alertness
with
feet
parallel
and
in
line
tail
at
right
angles
to
the
body
and
resting
horizontally
on
the
ground
and
hands
held
against
the
breast
he
has
the
happy
and
childish
eagerness
of
a
standing
chipmunk
and
the
alert
and
capable
attitude
of
an
erect
and
listening
grizzly
bear
illustration
a
young
beaver
on
the
side
of
a
beaver
house
the
beaver
is
larger
than
most
people
imagine
mature
male
specimens
are
about
inches
in
length
and
weigh
about
pounds
but
occasionally
one
is
found
that
weighs
seventy
or
more
pounds
ten
mature
males
which
i
measured
in
the
rocky
mountains
showed
an
average
length
of
forty
inches
with
an
average
weight
of
pounds
the
tails
of
these
ten
averaged
ten
inches
in
length
four
and
a
half
inches
in
width
across
the
centre
and
one
inch
in
thickness
behind
the
shoulders
the
average
circumference
was
inches
and
around
the
abdomen
ten
mature
females
which
i
measured
were
only
a
trifle
smaller
there
are
twenty
teeth
in
each
jaw
there
are
eight
molars
and
two
incisors
the
four
front
teeth
of
the
beaver
are
large
strong
and
have
a
edge
of
enamel
the
ears
are
very
short
and
rounded
the
sense
of
smell
appears
to
be
the
most
highly
developed
of
the
beaver
senses
next
to
this
that
of
hearing
appears
to
be
the
most
informational
the
eyes
are
weak
the
hind
feet
are
large
and
webbed
and
resemble
those
of
a
goose
the
second
claw
of
each
hind
foot
is
double
and
is
used
in
combing
the
fur
and
in
dislodging
the
parasites
from
the
skin
the
fore
paws
of
the
beaver
are
handlike
and
have
long
strong
claws
they
are
used
very
much
after
the
fashion
in
which
monkeys
use
their
hands
and
serve
a
number
of
purposes
the
color
of
the
beaver
is
a
reddish
brown
sometimes
shading
into
a
very
dark
brown
occasional
specimens
are
white
or
black
the
beaver
is
not
a
handsome
animal
and
when
in
action
on
the
land
he
is
awkward
the
black
skin
which
covers
his
tail
appears
to
be
covered
with
scales
the
skin
merely
has
this
form
and
appearance
the
scales
do
not
exist
the
tail
somewhat
resembles
the
end
of
an
oar
the
tools
of
this
workman
are
his
four
front
teeth
these
are
that
are
adaptable
and
they
are
set
in
strong
jaws
and
operated
by
powerful
muscles
thus
equipped
he
can
easily
cut
wood
these
teeth
grow
with
surprising
rapidity
if
accident
befalls
them
so
that
the
upper
and
the
lower
fail
to
bear
and
wear
they
will
grow
by
each
other
and
in
a
short
time
become
of
an
uncanny
length
i
have
found
several
dead
beaver
who
had
apparently
died
of
starvation
their
teeth
overlapped
with
jaws
wide
open
and
thus
prevented
their
procuring
food
for
a
time
i
possessed
an
overgrown
tooth
that
was
and
a
trifle
more
than
six
inches
long
pounds
considered
the
beaver
is
a
powerful
animal
and
over
a
rough
trail
will
drag
objects
of
twice
his
own
weight
or
roll
a
of
gigantic
size
up
a
strong
current
he
will
tow
an
or
sapling
without
apparent
effort
three
or
four
have
rolled
a
boulder
into
place
in
the
dam
commonly
he
does
things
at
opportune
times
and
in
the
easiest
way
his
energy
is
not
wasted
in
building
a
dam
where
one
is
not
needed
nor
in
constructive
work
in
times
of
high
water
he
accepts
deep
water
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
constructs
dams
to
make
shallow
places
deep
beaver
food
is
largely
inner
bark
of
deciduous
or
trees
foremost
among
these
trees
which
they
use
for
food
is
the
aspen
although
the
cottonwood
and
willow
are
eaten
almost
as
freely
the
bark
of
the
birch
alder
maple
and
a
number
of
other
trees
is
also
used
except
in
times
of
dire
emergency
the
beaver
will
not
eat
the
bark
of
the
pine
spruce
or
fir
tree
it
is
fortunate
that
the
trees
which
the
beaver
fell
and
use
for
food
or
building
purposes
are
trees
which
not
only
sprout
from
both
stump
and
root
but
grow
with
exceeding
rapidity
among
other
lesser
foods
used
are
berries
mushrooms
sedge
grass
and
the
leaves
and
stalks
of
a
number
of
plants
in
winter
dried
grass
and
leaves
are
sometimes
used
and
in
this
season
the
rootstocks
of
the
and
the
roots
of
the
willow
alder
birch
and
other
trees
that
may
be
got
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
beaver
are
vegetarians
they
do
not
eat
fish
or
flesh
apparently
beaver
prefer
to
cut
trees
that
are
less
than
six
inches
in
diameter
and
where
slender
poles
abound
it
is
rare
for
anything
to
be
cut
of
more
than
four
inches
but
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
trees
felled
that
are
from
twelve
to
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
in
my
possession
are
three
stumps
each
of
which
has
a
greater
diameter
than
eighteen
inches
the
largest
being
inches
the
largest
stump
that
i
have
ever
measured
was
on
the
jefferson
river
in
montana
near
the
mouth
of
pipestone
creek
this
was
three
feet
six
inches
in
diameter
the
beaver
sits
upright
with
fore
paws
against
the
tree
or
clasping
it
half
squatting
on
his
hind
legs
with
tail
either
extending
behind
as
a
prop
or
folded
beneath
him
as
a
seat
he
tilts
his
head
from
side
to
side
and
makes
deep
bites
into
the
tree
about
sixteen
inches
above
the
ground
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
trees
that
i
have
seen
most
of
the
cutting
was
done
from
one
side
from
one
seat
as
it
were
though
the
notch
taken
out
was
rudely
done
it
was
after
the
fashion
of
the
the
beaver
bites
above
and
below
then
driving
his
teeth
behind
the
piece
thus
cut
off
will
wedge
pry
or
pull
out
the
chip
ofttimes
in
doing
this
he
appears
to
use
his
jaw
as
a
lever
with
the
aspen
or
with
other
trees
equally
soft
about
one
hour
is
required
to
gnaw
down
a
sapling
with
one
bite
he
will
snip
off
a
limb
from
half
to
three
quarters
of
an
inch
in
diameter
after
a
tree
is
felled
on
land
the
limbs
are
cut
off
and
the
trunk
is
gnawed
into
sections
the
length
of
these
sections
appears
to
depend
upon
the
size
of
the
and
also
the
distance
to
the
water
the
number
of
beaver
to
assist
in
its
transportation
and
the
character
of
the
trail
commonly
a
or
tree
is
cut
into
lengths
of
about
four
to
six
feet
if
the
tree
falls
into
the
water
of
the
pond
or
the
canal
it
is
if
the
limbs
are
not
too
long
transported
butt
foremost
to
the
desired
spot
in
its
uncut
untrimmed
entirety
ofttimes
with
a
large
tree
the
trunk
is
left
and
only
the
limbs
taken
the
green
wood
which
the
beaver
uses
for
his
winter
is
stored
on
the
bottom
of
the
pond
how
does
he
sink
it
to
the
bottom
there
is
an
old
and
tale
which
says
that
the
beaver
sucks
the
air
from
the
green
wood
so
as
to
sink
it
promptly
another
tale
has
it
that
the
beaver
dives
to
the
bottom
carrying
with
him
a
green
stick
which
he
thrusts
into
the
mud
and
it
is
thus
anchored
apparently
the
method
is
a
simple
one
the
green
wood
stored
is
almost
as
heavy
as
water
and
once
in
the
pond
it
becomes
and
sinks
in
a
short
time
however
the
first
pieces
stored
are
commonly
large
heavy
chunks
which
are
forced
to
the
bottom
by
piling
others
on
top
of
them
frequently
the
first
few
pieces
of
the
consist
of
entire
trees
limbs
and
all
these
usually
are
placed
in
a
rude
circle
with
butts
inward
and
tops
outward
this
forms
an
entangling
foundation
which
holds
in
place
the
smaller
stuff
piled
thereon
most
willows
by
beaver
colonies
are
small
and
comparatively
light

in

days
if
mother
nature
should
ever
call
me
to
live
upon
another
planet
i
could
wish
that
i
might
be
born
a
beaver
to
inhabit
a
house
in
the
water
our
friend
the
beaver
one
bright
autumn
afternoon
i
peered
down
into
a
little
meadow
by
a
beaver
pond
this
meadow
was
and
free
from
willows
in
it
seven
or
eight
beaver
were
at
work
along
a
new
canal
each
kept
his
place
and
appeared
to
have
a
section
in
which
he
did
his
digging
for
more
than
half
an
hour
i
watched
them
clawing
out
the
earth
and
and
lifting
it
out
in
double
handfuls
and
piling
it
in
an
orderly
line
along
the
while
i
was
watching
a
worker
at
one
end
of
this
line
two
others
clinched
in
a
fight
the
fighters
made
no
sound
except
a
subdued
guttural
mumbling
as
they
rolled
about
in
a
struggle
the
other
workers
to
my
astonishment
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
to
this
fight
but
each
attended
to
his
own
affairs
after
two
or
three
minutes
the
belligerents
broke
away
one
squatted
down
breathing
heavily
while
the
other
with
bloody
tail
dragged
himself
off
and
plunged
into
the
pond
this
was
the
first
beaver
fight
that
i
had
ever
seen
beaver
may
well
be
called
the
silent
workers
no
matter
how
numerous
or
crowded
or
busy
they
are
their
work
goes
on
without
a
word
and
apparently
without
a
sign
although
i
have
seen
them
at
work
scores
of
times
in
the
twilight
and
in
the
daylight
singly
in
pairs
and
by
the
dozens
doing
the
many
kinds
of
work
which
beaver
perform
yet
this
work
has
always
gone
quietly
and
without
any
visible
evidences
of
management
each
one
is
capable
of
acting
independently
since
the
quality
of
his
work
improves
as
the
beaver
increases
his
experience
it
appears
natural
and
probable
that
each
colony
of
beaver
has
a
leader
who
plans
and
directs
the
work
i
am
familiar
with
a
number
of
instances
which
strongly
indicate
leadership
in
times
of
emergency
when
an
entire
colony
is
forced
to
emigrate
a
beaver
and
usually
an
aged
one
takes
the
lead
and
wherever
he
goes
the
others
willingly
follow
whatever
may
have
been
the
custom
of
beaver
in
the
past
at
present
large
numbers
sometimes
coöperate
in
accomplishing
community
work
it
used
to
be
believed
and
possibly
it
was
true
that
only
the
members
of
a
family
or
the
beaver
of
one
house
united
in
doing
the
general
work
of
the
colony
it
was
a
common
belief
that
seven
beaver
inhabited
a
house
perhaps
eight
was
the
number
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
at
the
present
time
the
number
in
a
house
is
from
one
to
thirty
beaver
have
been
driven
from
most
of
the
streams
and
and
now
maintain
themselves
with
difficulty
in
the
places
which
they
inhabit
in
surviving
they
probably
have
had
to
sacrifice
a
few
old
customs
and
to
adopt
some
new
ones
and
it
is
likely
that
these
changes
sometimes
call
for
larger
houses
so
as
to
care
for
the
increased
number
of
beaver
which
conditions
now
compel
to
live
in
one
locality
a
number
of
instances
have
come
under
my
notice
where
beaver
were
driven
from
their
colony
either
by
fire
or
by
the
aggressiveness
of
trappers
these
moved
on
to
other
scenes
where
they
cast
their
lot
with
the
beaver
of
another
colony
and
apparently
were
received
with
every
welcome
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
the
immigrants
enlargements
were
at
once
commenced
apparently
to
accommodate
the
permanently
one
autumn
while
following
the
lewis
and
clark
trail
with
a
pack
horse
in
western
montana
i
made
camp
one
evening
with
a
trapper
who
gave
me
a
young
beaver
he
was
about
one
month
old
and
ate
twigs
and
bark
as
naturally
as
though
he
had
long
eaten
them
i
named
him
diver
and
in
a
short
time
he
was
as
chummy
as
a
young
puppy
of
an
evening
he
played
about
the
camp
and
often
swam
in
the
water
at
times
he
played
at
and
frequently
displayed
his
accomplishment
of
felling
wonderful
trees
that
were
about
the
size
of
a
lead
pencil
he
never
failed
to
come
promptly
when
i
whistled
for
him
at
night
he
crouched
near
my
camp
usually
packing
himself
under
the
edge
of
the
canvas
on
which
i
spread
my
bedding
atop
the
pack
on
the
horse
back
he
traveled
a
ride
which
he
evidently
enjoyed
he
was
never
in
a
hurry
to
be
taken
off
and
at
moving
time
he
was
always
waiting
eagerly
to
be
lifted
on
as
soon
as
he
noticed
me
arranging
the
pack
he
came
close
and
before
i
was
quite
ready
for
him
he
rose
up
extending
his
hands
in
rapid
succession
beggingly
and
with
a
whining
sort
of
muttering
pleaded
to
be
lifted
at
once
to
his
seat
on
the
pack
illustration
a
young
beaver
sunning
himself
he
had
a
bad
fright
one
evening
about
one
hour
before
sundown
we
had
encamped
as
usual
alongside
a
stream
he
entered
the
water
and
after
swimming
about
for
a
time
taking
a
dozen
or
so
merry
dives
he
crossed
to
the
opposite
side
in
plain
view
only
fifty
feet
away
i
watched
him
as
he
busily
dug
out
roots
of
the
oregon
grape
and
then
stopped
leisurely
to
eat
them
while
he
was
thus
engaged
a
coyote
made
a
dash
for
him
from
behind
a
boulder
diver
dodged
and
the
coyote
missed
giving
a
wail
like
a
frightened
child
my
youngster
rolled
into
the
stream
and
dived
presently
he
scrambled
out
of
the
water
near
me
and
made
haste
to
crawl
under
my
behind
the
log
on
which
i
sat
the
nearest
beaver
pond
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
upstream
yet
less
than
five
minutes
had
elapsed
from
the
time
of
diver
cry
when
two
beaver
appeared
swimming
low
and
cautiously
in
the
stream
before
me
a
minute
later
another
came
in
sight
from
downstream
all
circled
about
swimming
cautiously
with
heads
held
low
in
the
water
one
scented
the
place
where
the
coyote
had
attacked
diver
and
waddled
out
and
made
a
sniffing
examination
another
came
ashore
at
the
spot
where
diver
came
out
to
me
apparently
his
eyes
told
him
i
was
a
part
of
the
log
but
his
nose
proclaimed
danger
after
three
or
four
hesitating
and
ineffectual
attempts
to
retreat
he
plucked
up
courage
and
rose
to
full
height
on
hind
legs
and
tail
to
stare
eagerly
at
me
with
head
well
up
and
fore
paws
drooping
he
held
the
gaze
for
several
seconds
and
then
gave
a
low
whistle
at
this
diver
came
forth
from
behind
my
coat
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
old
one
started
forward
to
meet
him
but
on
having
a
good
look
at
me
whirled
and
made
a
jumping
dive
into
the
water
whacking
the
surface
with
his
tail
as
he
disappeared
instantly
there
followed
two
or
more
splashes
and
a
number
of
upon
the
water
as
though
a
beaver
rescue
party
were
beating
a
retreat
at
the
end
of
my
outing
diver
became
the
pet
of
two
pioneer
children
on
the
bank
of
the
snake
river
he
followed
the
children
about
and
romped
with
them
at
three
years
of
age
he
was
shot
by
a
visiting
hunter
my
experience
with
diver
and
other
beaver
pets
leads
me
to
believe
that
beaver
are
easily
domesticated
one
morning
in
northern
idaho
the
family
with
whom
i
had
spent
the
night
took
me
out
to
see
a
beaver
colony
that
was
within
a
stone
throw
of
their
fireplace
three
beaver
came
out
of
the
water
within
ten
feet
of
us
to
eat
scraps
of
bread
which
the
children
threw
on
the
grass
for
them
one
day
i
placed
myself
between
three
young
beaver
who
were
eating
on
land
and
the
river
out
of
which
they
came
they
were
on
one
of
the
rocky
borders
of
the
colorado
river
in
the
depths
of
the
upper
grand
cañon
they
attempted
to
get
by
me
but
their
efforts
were
not
of
the
do
or
die
nature
presently
their
mother
came
to
the
rescue
and
attempted
to
attract
my
attention
by
floating
in
the
water
near
me
in
a
terribly
crippled
condition
i
had
seen
many
birds
and
a
few
beaver
try
that
clever
ruse
so
i
allowed
it
to
go
on
hoping
to
see
another
act
another
followed
in
it
an
old
male
beaver
appeared
he
swam
easily
downstream
until
within
a
few
yards
of
me
and
then
dived
apparently
frightened
but
presently
he
reappeared
near
by
and
dived
again
while
i
was
watching
him
the
youngsters
edged
a
few
yards
nearer
the
river
to
stop
them
and
prolong
the
exhibition
i
advanced
close
to
them
as
though
to
grab
them
at
this
the
mother
beaver
struggled
out
of
the
water
and
set
up
a
tumbling
and
rolling
so
close
to
me
that
i
thought
to
catch
her
for
examination
she
dodged
right
and
left
and
reached
the
water
while
this
was
going
on
the
youngsters
escaped
into
the
river
mother
beaver
instantly
recovered
and
as
she
dived
gave
the
water
a
scornful
whack
with
her
tail
the
beaver
is
not
often
heard
he
works
in
silence
when
he
pauses
from
his
work
he
sits
meditatively
like
a
philosopher
at
times
however
when
in
traveling
beaver
are
separated
from
one
another
they
give
a
strange
shrill
whistle
or
call
occasionally
this
whistle
appears
to
be
a
call
of
alarm
suspicion
or
warning
sometimes
when
alarmed
a
young
beaver
gives
a
shrill
and
frightened
cry
not
unlike
that
of
a
lost
human
child
on
a
few
occasions
i
have
heard
while
listening
near
a
beaver
house
in
the
early
summer
something
of
a
subdued
concert
going
on
inside
a
purring
rhythmic
melody
they
have
a
kind
of
love
ditty
also
this
is
a
rhythmic
murmur
and
sigh
very
appealing
and
it
seems
strangely
elemental
as
it
floats
across
the
beaver
pond
in
the
twilight
it
is
probable
that
beaver
mate
for
life
all
that
is
known
concerning
their
ways
indicates
that
they
are
good
parents
the
young
are
usually
born
during
the
month
of
april
the
number
varies
from
one
to
eight
probably
four
is
the
number
most
common
a
short
time
before
the
birth
of
the
youngsters
the
mother
invites
the
father
to
leave
or
compels
him
to
do
so
or
he
may
go
voluntarily
and
she
has
possession
of
the
house
or
burrow
probably
alone
at
the
time
the
youngsters
are
born
their
eyes
are
open
from
the
beginning
and
in
less
than
two
weeks
they
appear
in
the
water
accompanied
by
the
mother
often
i
have
investigated
beaver
colonies
endeavoring
to
determine
the
number
of
youngsters
at
a
birth
many
times
there
were
four
of
these
furry
serious
little
fellows
near
the
house
on
a
log
that
was
thrust
up
through
the
water
at
other
times
from
one
to
eight
youngsters
sunned
themselves
on
the
top
of
the
rude
home
one
may
in
examining
beaver
colonies
i
saw
three
sets
of
youngsters
in
the
moraine
colony
they
numbered
three
and
two
and
five
one
mother
in
another
colony
proudly
exhibited
eight
while
still
another
who
had
been
harassed
all
winter
by
trappers
and
who
lived
in
a
burrow
in
the
bank
could
display
but
one
it
is
not
uncommon
for
young
orphan
beavers
to
be
cared
for
and
adopted
by
another
mother
beaver
i
have
notes
of
three
mothers
who
with
children
of
their
own
at
once
took
charge
of
orphans
left
by
the
death
of
a
neighbor
one
june
a
mother
beaver
was
killed
near
my
camp
her
children
escaped
the
following
evening
a
new
mother
with
four
children
of
her
own
adopted
them
and
moved
from
her
own
home
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
to
the
home
of
her
dead
neighbor
and
there
brought
all
the
youngsters
up
beaver
have
great
fun
while
growing
up
posted
on
the
edge
of
the
house
they
nose
and
push
each
other
about
ofttimes
tumbling
one
another
into
the
water
in
the
water
they
send
a
thousand
merry
ripples
to
the
shore
as
they
race
wrestle
and
dive
in
the
pond
they
play
on
the
house
in
the
pond
and
in
the
sunshine
and
shadows
of
the
trees
along
the
shore
beaver
are
mature
the
third
summer
of
their
lives
and
at
this
time
they
commonly
leave
the
parental
home
pair
and
begin
life
for
themselves
there
are
stories
to
the
effect
that
the
parents
of
the
youthful
accompany
the
children
to
new
scenes
help
them
select
a
and
assist
in
the
construction
of
the
new
house
and
dam
after
this
the
parents
return
home
this
probably
is
occasionally
true
anyway
i
once
saw
this
program
fairly
well
carried
out
and
at
another
time
in
a
limited
manner
the
beaver
is
practical
peaceful
and
industrious
he
builds
a
permanent
house
and
keeps
it
clean
and
in
repair
beside
it
he
stores
for
the
long
winter
he
takes
thought
for
the
morrow
these
and
other
commendable
characteristics
give
him
a
place
of
honor
among
the
hordes
of
homeless
folk
of
the
wild
during
the
winter
he
has
but
little
to
do
except
bathe
and
eat
his
two
or
three
meals
a
day
from
the
food
he
has
stored
in
the
autumn
towards
spring
when
his
wild
neighbors
are
lean
hungry
and
cold
he
is
fat
and
comfortable
in
the
spring
he
emerges
from
the
house
but
then
his
only
work
is
occasionally
to
cut
a
twig
for
food
in
the
summer
he
plays
tourist
he
visits
other
colonies
and
wanders
up
and
down
streams
going
miles
from
home
in
the
late
summer
or
early
autumn
he
returns
makes
repairs
and
harvests
food
for
winter
the
beaver
is
a
valuable
conservationist
but
there
are
localities
in
which
he
can
not
be
tolerated
although
dead
wood
is
rarely
cut
by
the
beaver
many
a
homesteader
has
been
disturbed
by
his
cutting
off
and
carrying
away
green
fence
posts
recently
beaver
have
returned
to
a
few
localities
and
got
themselves
into
bad
repute
by
felling
fruit
trees
occasionally
too
in
the
west
they
have
lost
caste
by
persistently
damming
an
and
diverting
the
water
despite
the
fact
that
a
court
has
given
both
the
title
and
the
right
to
this
water
to
some
one
else
a
mile
or
so
down
the
ditch
in
all
logging
operations
beaver
never
fail
where
there
is
opportunity
to
cut
trees
upstream
and
float
them
down
with
the
current
is
an
interesting
phase
of
beaver
life
a
beaver
will
go
waddling
dully
from
the
water
to
a
tree
he
is
about
to
cut
down
all
will
look
about
for
enemies
one
may
be
wise
enough
but
the
majority
will
not
do
so
to
look
upward
to
see
if
the
tree
about
to
be
felled
is
entangled
at
the
top
all
appear
to
choose
a
comfortable
place
on
which
to
squat
or
sit
while
cutting
commonly
when
the
tree
begins
to
creak
and
settle
the
beaver
who
has
done
the
cutting
thuds
the
ground
a
few
times
with
his
tail
and
then
scampers
away
usually
going
into
the
water
sometimes
the
workers
give
the
thudding
signal
in
advance
of
the
one
who
is
doing
the
cutting
now
and
then
no
warning
signal
is
given
and
the
logging
beaver
occasionally
fells
his
tree
upon
other
workers
with
a
fatal
result
as
with
the
beaver
doing
the
cutting
is
on
rare
occasions
caught
and
killed
by
the
tree
which
he
fells
rarely
does
the
beaver
give
any
thought
to
the
direction
in
which
the
tree
will
fall
in
a
few
instances
however
i
have
seen
what
appeared
to
be
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
beaver
to
fell
a
tree
in
a
given
direction
from
an
uncomfortable
place
he
cut
the
lowest
notch
on
the
side
on
which
he
probably
wanted
the
tree
to
fall
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
aspen
tree
selected
stood
in
an
almost
complete
circle
of
pines
the
beaver
took
pains
to
cut
the
first
and
lowest
notch
in
this
tree
directly
opposite
the
opening
in
the
pines
i
have
seen
a
number
of
instances
of
this
kind
and
he
will
sometimes
leave
the
windward
side
of
a
grove
on
a
windy
day
and
cut
on
the
leeward
so
that
the
felled
trees
are
not
entangled
in
falling
rarely
does
more
than
one
beaver
work
at
the
same
time
at
a
tree
in
some
instances
however
if
the
tree
be
large
two
or
even
more
beaver
will
work
at
once
but
after
the
tree
has
been
felled
ofttimes
three
or
four
beaver
will
unite
to
roll
a
large
section
to
the
water
in
doing
this
some
may
stand
with
paws
against
it
and
push
and
others
may
put
their
sides
or
hips
against
it
on
land
as
in
the
water
small
trees
are
dragged
butt
foremost
so
as
to
meet
the
least
resistance
sometimes
the
beaver
drags
walking
backwards
at
other
times
he
is
alongside
the
tree
carrying
and
dragging
it
forward
illustration
in
the
aspens
cut
by
beaver
early
explorers
say
that
beaver
do
most
of
their
work
at
night
in
this
they
are
practically
unanimous
however
in
long
journal
written
in
beaver
were
reported
at
work
in
broad
daylight
a
few
other
early
writers
have
also
mentioned
this
daylight
work
they
probably
work
in
darkness
because
that
is
the
safest
time
for
them
to
be
out
during
dozens
of
my
visits
to
secluded
localities
localities
which
had
not
been
visited
by
man
and
certainly
not
by
trappers
i
found
beaver
freely
at
work
in
broad
daylight
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
day
work
was
common
during
primeval
times
and
that
although
the
beaver
now
do
and
long
have
done
most
of
their
work
at
night
in
localities
where
they
are
not
in
danger
from
man
they
work
freely
during
daytime
both
the
indians
and
the
trappers
have
a
story
that
old
beaver
who
will
not
work
are
driven
from
the
colony
and
become
morose
outcasts
slowly
living
away
the
days
by
themselves
in
a
burrow
i
have
no
evidence
to
verify
this
statement
and
am
inclined
to
think
that
solitary
beaver
occasionally
found
in
abandoned
and
elsewhere
are
simply
unfortunates
perhaps
weighed
down
with
age
unable
to
travel
far
with
teeth
worn
the
mate
dead
without
ambition
to
try
or
without
strength
to
emigrate
it
is
more
likely
that
these
aged
ones
voluntarily
and
sadly
withdraw
from
their
cheerful
and
industrious
fellows
to
spend
their
closing
days
alone
although
too
there
were
among
indians
and
trappers
stories
of
beaver
slaves
i
am
without
material
for
a
story
of
this
kind
the
beaver
is
peaceful
although
the
males
occasionally
fight
among
themselves
the
beaver
avoids
fighting
and
plans
his
life
so
as
to
escape
without
it
now
and
then
in
the
water
one
closes
with
an
otter
in
a
desperate
struggle
and
when
cornered
on
land
one
will
sometimes
turn
upon
a
preying
foe
with
such
ferocity
and
skill
that
his
assailant
is
glad
to
retreat
on
two
occasions
i
have
known
a
beaver
to
kill
a
bobcat
beaver
are
not
equally
alert
in
many
cases
this
difference
may
be
due
to
a
difference
in
age
or
experience
beaver
have
been
caught
with
scars
which
show
that
they
have
been
trapped
before
a
few
even
having
lost
two
feet
in
escaping
from
traps
on
the
other
hand
skillful
trappers
have
found
themselves
after
repeated
trials
unable
to
catch
a
single
beaver
from
a
populous
colony
sometimes
in
colonies
of
this
kind
the
beaver
even
audaciously
turned
the
traps
upside
down
or
contemptuously
covered
them
with
mud
nor
is
the
work
of
all
beaver
alike
the
ditches
which
one
beaver
digs
the
house
one
builds
or
the
dam
one
makes
may
be
executed
with
much
greater
speed
and
with
more
skill
than
those
of
a
neighboring
beaver
many
houses
are
crude
and
unshapely
masses
many
dams
haphazard
in
appearance
while
a
few
canals
are
crooked
and
uneven
but
the
majority
do
good
work
and
are
quick
to
take
advantage
of
opportunity
quick
to
adjust
themselves
to
new
conditions
or
to
use
the
best
means
that
is
available
beaver
probably
have
made
numbers
of
changes
in
their
manners
habits
and
customs
and
those
changes
undoubtedly
have
enabled
them
to
survive
relentless
pursuit
and
to
leave
descendants
upon
the
earth
the
industry
of
the
beaver
is
proverbial
and
it
is
to
the
credit
of
any
person
to
have
the
distinction
of
working
like
a
beaver
most
people
have
the
idea
that
the
beaver
is
always
at
work
not
that
he
necessarily
accomplishes
much
at
this
work
but
that
he
is
always
doing
something
the
fact
remains
that
under
normal
conditions
he
works
less
than
half
the
time
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
him
to
spend
a
large
share
of
each
year
in
what
might
be
called
play
he
is
physically
capable
of
intense
and
prolonged
application
and
being
an
intelligent
worker
even
though
he
works
less
than
half
the
time
he
accomplishes
large
results
the
beaver
past
and
present
all
indian
tribes
in
north
america
appear
to
have
had
one
or
more
legends
concerning
the
beaver
most
of
these
legends
credit
him
with
being
a
worthy
and
industrious
fellow
and
the
cherokees
are
said
to
trace
their
origin
to
a
sacred
and
practical
beaver
many
of
the
tribes
had
a
legend
which
told
that
long
long
ago
the
great
waters
surged
around
a
shoreless
world
these
waters
were
peopled
with
beaver
beaver
of
a
gigantic
size
these
along
with
the
great
spirit
dived
and
brought
up
quantities
of
mud
and
shaped
this
into
the
hills
and
dales
the
mountains
where
the
cataracts
plunged
and
sang
and
all
the
caves
and
cañons
the
scattered
boulders
and
broken
crags
upon
the
earth
were
the
missiles
thrown
by
evil
spirits
who
in
the
beginning
of
things
endeavored
to
hinder
and
prevent
the
constructive
work
of
creation
the
beaver
has
been
found
in
fossil
both
in
europe
and
in
america
remnants
of
the
dugout
and
the
teeth
of
beaver
together
with
rude
stone
implements
of
primitive
man
have
been
found
in
england
near
albany
new

ooze
fossil
beaver
were
of
enormous
size
coming
down
to
comparatively
modern
times
the
animal
as
we
now
know
him
appears
to
have
been
distributed
over
almost
all
asia
europe
and
north
america
there
was
no
marked
difference
in
the
individuals
that
inhabited
these
three
continents
the
beaver
is
probably
extinct
in
europe
but
in
july
i
found
a
piece
of
wood
floating
in
the
seine
that
had
been
recently
gnawed
by
a
beaver
at
this
time
i
was
assured
that
not
even
a
tame
beaver
could
be
found
in
europe
it
is
still
found
in
parts
of
siberia
and
central
asia
that
form
which
inhabits
south
america
is
very
unlike
those
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
may
be
called
a
link
between
the
muskrat
and
the
beaver
reference
is
made
to
the
beaver
in
ancient
egyptian
hieroglyphics
and
herodotus
makes
repeated
mention
of
it
pliny
also
gives
a
brief
account
of
this
animal
in
germany
in
the
right
of
hunting
beaver
was
conferred
along
with
other
special
hunting
privileges
and
a
bull
of
pope
lucius
iii
in
gave
to
a
monastery
all
the
beaver
found
within
the
bounds
of
its
property
a
royal
edict
issued
at
berlin
in
march
insisted
upon
the
protection
of
beaver
before
the
white
man
came
beaver
were
widely
distributed
over
north
america
perhaps
more
widely
than
any
other
animal
the
beaver
population
was
large
and
probably
was
densest
to
the
southwest
of
hudson
bay
and
around
the
headwaters
of
the
missouri
and
columbia
rivers
their
scantiest
population
areas
in
the
united
states
appear
to
have
been
southern
florida
and
the
lower
mississippi
valley
this
scantiness
is
attributed
by
early
explorers
to
the
aggressiveness
of
the
alligators
all
the
southern
half
of
mexico
appears
to
have
been
without
a
beaver
population
but
elsewhere
over
north
america
wherever
there
were
deciduous
trees
and
water
and
in
a
few
treeless
places
where
there
were
only
water
and
grass
the
beaver
were
found
along
the
thousands
of
smaller
streams
throughout
north
america
there
was
colony
after
colony
dam
after
dam
in
close
succession
as
many
as
three
hundred
beaver
ponds
to
the
mile
lewis
and
clark
mention
the
fact
that
near
the
three
forks
montana
the
streams
stretched
away
in
a
succession
of
beaver
ponds
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
statements
made
by
the
early
explorers
settlers
and
trappers
together
with
my
own
observations
which
commenced
in
and
which
have
extended
pretty
well
over
the
country
from
northern
mexico
into
alaska
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
beaver
population
of
north
america
at
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
upwards
of
one
hundred
million
the
area
occupied
was
approximately
six
million
square
miles
and
probably
two
hundred
beaver
population
per
square
mile
would
be
a
conservative
number
for
the
general
average
in
the
united
states
there
are
a
number
of
counties
and
more
than
one
hundred
streams
and
lakes
named
for
the
beaver
upwards
of
fifty
are
plain
beaver
beaver
pond
beaver
meadow
or
some
other
combination
that
proclaims
the
former
prevalence
of
this
widely
distributed
builder
the
beaver
is
the
national
emblematic
animal
of
canada
and
there
too
numerous
lakes
and
streams
are
named
for

beaver
skins
lured
the
hunter
and
trapper
over
all
american
wilds
these
skins
were
one
of
the
earliest
mediums
of
exchange
among
the
settlers
of
north
america
for
two
hundred
years
they
were
one
of
the
most
important
exports
and
for
a
longer
time
they
were
also
the
chief
commodity
of
trade
on
the
frontier
a
beaver
skin
was
not
only
the
standard
by
which
other
skins
were
measured
in
value
but
also
the
standard
of
value
by
which
guns
sugar
cattle
hatchets
and
clothing
were
measured
though
freely
used
by
the
early
settlers
for
clothing
they
were
especially
valuable
as
raw
material
for
the
manufacture
of
hats
and
for
this
purpose
were
largely
exported
from
this
animal
were
prepared
many
remedies
which
in
former
times
were
believed
to
have
high
medicinal
value
castoreum
was
the
most
popular
of
these
and
from
it
was
compounded
the
great
the
skin
of
the
beaver
was
thought
to
be
an
excellent
preventive
of
colic
and
consumption
the
fat
of
the
beaver
efficient
in
apoplexy
and
epilepsy
to
stop
spasms
and
for
various
afflictions
of
the
nerves
powdered
beaver
teeth
were
often
given
in
soup
for
the
prevention
of
many
diseases
the
castoreum
of
the
beaver
was
considered
a
most
efficient
remedy
for
earache
deafness
headache
and
gout
for
the
restoring
of
the
memory
and
the
cure
of
insanity
next
in

to

the

was
valued
for
the
castoreum
it
yielded
the

and
first
settlers
forecast
with
confidence
the
weather
from
the
actions
of
the
beaver
this
animal
was
credited
with
being
to
a
high
degree
from
his
actions
the
nature
of
the
oncoming
winter
was
predicted
and
plans
to
meet
it
were
made
accordingly
faith
in
the
beaver
actions
and
activities
as
a
basis
for
was
almost
absolute
if
the
beaver
began
work
early
the
winter
was
to
begin
early
if
the
beaver
laid
up
a
large
harvest
covered
the
house
deeply
with
mud
and
raised
the
of
the
pond
the
winter
was
of
course
to
be
a
long
and
severe
one
extensive
autumn
rambles
in
the
mountains
with
especial
attention
to
beaver
customs
compels
me
to
conclude
that
as
a
basis
for
weather
prediction
beaverdom
is
not
reliable
in
the
course
of
one
autumn
month
in
the
mountains
of
colorado
more
than
one
hundred
colonies
were
observed
in
many
colonies
work
for
the
winter
commenced
early
in
others
only
a
few
miles
distant
preparations
for
the
winter
did
not
begin
until
late
in
some
extensive
preparations
were
made
for
the
winter
in
a
few
the
harvest
laid
up
was
exceedingly
small
thus
in
one
month
of
the
same
year
i
saw
some
beaver
colonies
preparing
for
a
long
winter
and
others
for
a
short
one
many
preparing
for
a
hard
winter
and
others
almost
unprepared
for
winter
from
these
varied
and
conflicting
prognostications
how
was
one
accurately
to
forecast
the
coming
winter
the
old
prophets
in
one
colony
frequently
disagreed
with
aged
prophets
who
were
similarly
situated
but
in
a
neighboring
colony
at
one
place
thirty
or
more
beaver
gathered
an
enormous
quantity
of
food
sufficient
in
fact
to
have
supplied
twice
that
number
for
the
longest
and
most
severe
winter
the
winter
which
followed
was
as
mild
a
one
as
had
passed
over
the
rocky
mountains
in
fifty
years
not
one
tenth
of
the
big
was
eaten
i
have
not
detected
anything
that
indicates
that
the
beaver
ever
plan
for
an
especially
hard
winter
goodly
preparations
are
annually
made
for
winter
apparently
the
extent
of
the
preparation
in
any
colony
is
dependent
almost
entirely
upon
the
number
of
beaver
that
are
to
winter
in
that
colony
winter
preparations
consist
of
gathering
the
repairing
and
sometimes
raising
the
dam
and

of

to

not

the
cases
in
which
unusually

could
have
been

to
an

increase
of
population
in
a
beaver
colony
may
be
accounted
for
through
the
growing
up
of
youngsters
or
by
the
arrival
of
immigrants
or
both
where
the
temporary
inactivity
of

in

might
allow
the

colony
in

to
increase

where
the

of

might
be
increased

commence
work
earlier

others
and
some
colonies
make
extensive

this

by

it

one
of

all
the

has
so
greatly
improved
on

that
little
remains
to

added
to
his
account
of

beside
a
vocabulary
of
their

a
code

and
a
sketch
of
their

to
make
it
the
most
complete

however
the

does

are

morgan
was
for
years
a
capable
and
painstaking
student
of
the
beaver
that
which
he
has
written
is
so
important
a
contribution
concerning
the
beaver
that
no
one
interested
in
this
animal
can
afford
to
be
unacquainted
with
it
in
the
preface
of
his
book
he
says
i
took
up
the
subject
as
i
did
fishing
for
summer
recreation
in
the
year
i
had
occasion
to
visit
the
red
river
settlement
in
the
hudson
bay
territory
and
in
to
ascend
the
missouri
river
to
the
rocky
mountains
which
enabled
me
to
compare
the
works
of
the
beaver
in
these
localities
with
those
on
lake
superior
at
the
outset
i
had
no
expectation
of
following
up
the
subject
year
after
year
but
was
led
on
by
the
interest
which
it
awakened
until
the
materials
collected
seemed
to
be
worth
arranging
for
publication
the
greatest
admirers
of
the
beaver
are
those
who
know
him
best
he
bears
acquaintance
this
can
not
be
had
by
merely
looking
at
the
animal
nor
by
sympathetically
studying
his
monumental
works
these
works
will
of
course
impress
one
but
they
give
one
at
best
only
a
traveler
impression
long
and
repeated
visits
to
the
colony
in
its
busy
season
appear
to
be
the
best
way
to
get
at
the
character
of
the
beaver
the
cubical
contents
of
a
dam
may
not
even
suggest
the
obstacles
overcome
in
its
construction
the
labor

it

gathered
a
mile
away
and
skillfully
transported
to
the

with

amid

part
of

is
usually
gathered
far
from
the
house
and
on
the
dangerous
beaver
frontier
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
have
been
a
friendly
visitor
to
his
colonies
in
which
i
have
lingered
long
and
lovingly
that
he
makes
mistakes
is
certain
but
that
he
is
an
intelligent
reasoning
animal
i
have
long
firmly
believed
as
i
said
in
wild
life
on
the
rockies
i
have
so
often
seen
him
change
his
plans
so
wisely
and
meet
emergencies
so
promptly
and
well
that
i
can
think
of
him
only
as
a
reasoner
as
evidence
that
he
sometimes
reasons
it
may
be
cited
that
he
occasionally
endeavors
to
fell
trees
in
a
given
direction
that
he
often
avoids
cutting
those
entangled
at
the
top
that
sometimes
he
will
on
a
windy
day
fell
trees
on
the
leeward
side
of
a
grove
that
he
commonly
avoids
felling
trees
in
the
heart
of
a
grove
but
cuts
on
the
outskirts
of
it
he
occasionally
dams
a
stream
digs
a
canal
leads
water
to
a
dry
place
and
there
forms
and
fills
a
reservoir
and
establishes
a
home
often
his
house
is
built
by
a
spring
and
thus
the
danger
from
thick
ice
avoided
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
for
my
believing
him
to
be
intelligent
morgan
speaks
of
the
beaver
as
endowed
with
a
mental
principle
which
performs
for
him
the
same
office
that
the
human
mind
does
for
man
and
says
the
works
of
the
beaver
afford
many
interesting
illustrations
of
his
intelligence
and
reasoning
capacity
also
in
the
capacity
thereby
displayed
of
adapting
their
works
to
the
circumstances
in
which
they
find
themselves
placed
instead
of
following
blindly
an
invariable
type
some
evidence
of
possession
on
their
part
of

george
romanes
has
the
following
opinion
of
the
beaver
most
remarkable
among
rodents
for
instinct
and
intelligence
unquestionably
stands
the
beaver
indeed
there
is
no
animal
not
even
excepting
the
ants
and
bees
where
instinct
has
risen
to
a
higher
level
of
adaptation
to
certain
constant
conditions
of
environment
or
where
faculties
undoubtedly
instinctive
are
more
puzzlingly
wrought
up
with
faculties
no
less
undoubtedly
intelligent
it
is
truly
an
astonishing
fact
that
animals
should
engage
in
such
vast
architectural
labors
with
what
appears
to
be
the
deliberate
purpose
of
securing
by
such
artificial
means
the
special
benefits
that
arise
from
their
high
engineering
skill
so
astonishing
indeed
does
this
fact
appear
that
as
sober
minded
interpreters
of
fact
we
would
fain
look
for
some
explanation
which
would
not
necessitate
the
inference
that
these
actions
are
due
to
any
intelligent
appreciation
either
of
the
benefits
that
arise
from
labor
or
of
the
hydrostatic
principles
to
which
this
labor
so
clearly
refers

pays
the
beaver
the
following
peculiar
tribute
in
his
seventy
years
on
the
frontier
the
beaver
considered
as
an
engineer
is
a
remarkable
animal
he
can
run
a
tunnel
as
direct
as
the
best
engineer
could
do
with
his
instruments
to
guide
him
i
have
seen
where
they
have
built
a
dam
across
a
stream
and
not
having
sufficient
head
water
to
keep
their
pond
full
they
would
cross
to
a
stream
higher
up
the
side
of
the
mountain
and
cut
a
ditch
from
the
upper
stream
and
connect
it
with
the
pond
of
the
lower
and
do
it
as
neatly
as
an
engineer
with
his
tools
could
possibly
do
it
i
have
often
said
that
the
beaver
in
the
rocky
mountains
had
more
engineering
skill
than
the
entire
corps
of
engineers
who
were
connected
with
general
grant
army
when
he
besieged
vicksburg
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
the
beaver
would
never
have
attempted
to
turn
the
mississippi
into
a
canal
to
change
its
channel
without
first
making
a
dam
across
the
channel

the

starting

lived
should
you
ask

whence
these

whence
these
legends
and
traditions
with
the
odors
of
the

with
the

of

should
you
ask
where
nawadaha
found
these
songs
so
wild

found
these

i
should
answer
i
should
tell
you
the
of
the

in
the

of
the
beaver
and
the
cunning
fleeing
from
the

of

ran
till
he
came
unto
a
streamlet
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
to
a
streamlet
still
and
tranquil
that
had
overflowed
its
margin
to
a
dam
made
by
the
beavers
to
a
pond
of
quiet
water
where
the
trees
were
standing
where

floated
where
the
rushes
waved
and
whispered

on
the

of
trunks
and
branches
through
whose
chinks
the
water
spouted
whose
summit
flowed
the
streamlet
from
the
bottom
rose
the
beaver
looked
with
two
great
eyes
of
wonder
eyes
that
seemed
to
ask
a
question
at
the
stranger
the
beaver
dam
millions
of
beaver
ponds
graced
america
wild
gardens
at
the
time
the
first
settlers
came
these
ragged
and
poetic
ponds
varied
in
length
from
a
few
feet
to
one
mile
and
in
area
they
were
from
one
hundred
acres
down
to
a
miniature
pond
that
half
a
dozen
merry
children
might
encircle
these
ponds
were
formed
by
dams
built
by
beaver
and
the
dams
varied
greatly
in
size
and
were
made
of
poles
variously
combined
with
sticks
stones
trash
rushes
and
earth
in
the
bad
lands
of
dakota
i
saw
two
dams
that
were
made
of
chunks
of
coal
this
material
had
caved
from
a
bluff
i
have
noticed
a
few
that
were
constructed
of
the
of
these
dams
was
filled
and
covered
with
clay
and
they
were
the
work
of
grass
beavers
beaver
that
subsist
chiefly
on
grass
and
that
live
in
localities
almost
destitute
of
trees
it
is
doubtful
if
a
dam
is
ever
made
by
felling
logs
or
large
trees
across
the
stream
i
have
however
seen
a
few
real
log
dams
but
in
these
the
logs
were
placed
parallel
to
the
flow
of
water
one
of
these
was
in
the
sawtooth
mountains
of
idaho
here
a
swept
several
hundred
trees
down
the
mountain
this
wreckage
was
piled
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
beaver
in
a
colony
a
short
distance
away
accepted
this
gift
of
the
gods
and
of
these
unwieldy
logs
built
a
dam
about
two
hundred
feet
downstream
from
where
the
avalanche
had
piled
the
logs
this
dam
was
a
massive
affair
about
forty
feet
long
and
eight
feet
high
it
really
appeared
more
like
a
log
jam
than
a
dam
but
it
served
the
purpose
intended
and
raised
the
level
of
the
river
so
that
the
water
overflowed
to
one
side
and
spread
in
a
broad
sheet
against
a
cliff
and
through
a
grove
of
aspens
which
the
beaver
proceeded
to
harvest
the
majority
of
dams
are
made
of
slender
green
poles
which
are
placed
lengthwise
with
the
flow
for
the
bottom
and
set
braced
with
the
end
upstream
a
foot
or
so
higher
than
the
downstream
end
with
these
there
are
occasionally
used
small
limby
trees
the
large
end
of
the
tree
is
placed
upstream
and
the
small
bushy
end
downstream
if
in
a
current
these
sometimes
are
weighed
down
with
mud
or
stones
short
stout
sticks
and
long
slender
poles
are
deftly
mingled
in
the
dam
as
it
rises
the
poles
overlie
and
many
completed
dams
appear
as
though
made
of
gigantic
inclined
shears
and
compasses
of
poles
thus
a
dam
is
doubly
braced
the
weight
against
it
is
resisted
both
by
the
poles
that
are
parallel
to
the
flow
and
by
those
set
at
an
angle
to
it
illustration
a
new
dam
the
shape
and
the
material
of
a
dam
are
dependent
on
a
number
of
things
the
nature
of
the
place
where
built
the
kind
of
materials
available
for
its
building
the
purpose
it
is
intended
to
serve
and
the
relation
it
may
have
to
dams
already
constructed
sometimes
a
small
dam
will
be
made
that
may
ultimately
become
a
big
one
by
simply
digging
a
ditch
across
the
stream
or
basin
and
piling
the
excavated
material
into
a
dam
beaver
like
men
are
unequal
in
their
skill
both
in
planning
and
in
doing
work
and
the
work
of
most
beaver
falls
short
of
perfection
errors
are
not
uncommon
more
than
one
colony
has
commenced
a
dam
apparently
without
knowing
that
there
was
not
sufficient
available
material
to
complete
it
others
have
built
in
the
wrong
places
and
have
thus
failed
to
flood
the
area
which
they
desired
to
reach
or
cover
with
water
occasionally
the
difficulties
of
construction
have
been
too
great
for
the
beaver
who
attempted
it
and
the
dam
has
been
abandoned
in
an
incomplete
state
now
and
then
a
weak
dam
breaks
or
a
strong
one
is
swept
out
by
a
flood
but
why
do
beaver
need
or
want
the
pond
which
the
dam
forms
they
need
it
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
water
of
sufficient
depth
and
area
to
enable
them
to
move
about
in
safety
and
to
transport
their
with
the
greatest
ease
above
all
the
pond
is
a
place
of
refuge
into
which
the
beaver
can
constantly
plunge
and
have
security
from
his
numerous
and
ever
watchful
enemies
the
must
be
kept
in
the
water
the
beaver
is
in
his
element
on
the
land
he
is
a
child
lost
in
the
wilds
he
has
extremely
short
legs
and
a
heavy
body
his
fits
him
for
movement
in
the
water
he
is
a
graceful
swimmer
and
in
the
water
can
move
easily
and
evade
enemies
while
on
land
he
is
an
awkward
lubber
moves
slowly
and
is
easily
overtaken
water
of
sufficient
depth
and
area
then
is
essential
to
the
life
and
happiness
of
the
beaver
to
have
this
at
all
times
it
is
necessary
in
localities
where
the
supply
is
at
times
insufficient
to
maintain
it
by
means
of
dams
and
ponds
deep
ponds
are
needed
around
the
house
shallow
ponds
with
shores
in
groves
facilitate
logging
dams
are
placed
across
streams
whose
waters
are
to
be
led
away
through
new
channels
and
made
to
serve
elsewhere
in
canals
or
ponds
dams
are
made
across
inclined
canals
to
catch
and
hold
water
in
them
streams
are
beaver
avenues
of
travel
along
shallow
streams
in
a
beaver
country
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
an
occasional
short
dam
which
forms
a
deep
hole
which
apparently
is
maintained
as
a
harbor
or
place
of
safety
into
which
traveling
beaver
may
dive
and
be
made
safe
from
pursuit
most
beaver
dams
are
built
on
the
installment
plan
they
are
the
result
of
growth
the
new
dam
is
short
and
comparatively
low
it
is
enlarged
as
conditions
may
require
as
the
trees
in
the
edge
of
the
pond
are
harvested
the
dam
is
built
higher
and
longer
so
as
to
flood
a
larger
area
or
as
sediment
fills
the
pond
the
dam
is
from
time
to
time
raised
and
lengthened
in
order
to
maintain
the
desired
depth
of
water
thus
it
may
grow
through
the
years
until
the
possibilities
of
the
locality
are
exhausted
the
dam
may
then
be
abandoned
it
may
be
used
for
a
few
years
or
it
may
be
used
for
a
century
a
gigantic
beaver
dam
may
thus
represent
the
work
of
several
generations
of
beaver
it
often
occurs
that
one
or
more
generations
may
use
a
dam
and
yearly
add
something
to
its
size
by
and
by
these
beaver
may
die
or
emigrate
the
old
dam
remains
falling
to
ruin
in
places
years
go
by
and
other
beaver
come
upon
the
scene
the
old
dam
is
then
used
for
the
foundation
for
a
new
one
the
appearance
of
some
old
dams
indicates
that
they
have
been
repeatedly
used
and
abandoned
new
dams
being
made
largely
of
coarse
materials
appear
very
unlike
old
ones
decay
settling
repairs
and
other
changes
come
rapidly
the
dam
is
built
of
poles
it
speedily
becomes
earthy
and
is
planted
by
nature
to
grass
willows
and
flowers
on
old
large
dams
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
old
the
roots
of
these
entangle
the
constructive
materials
penetrate
deeply
and
help
to
anchor
securely
the
entire
dam
in
only
a
few
cases
are
the
of
dams
at
once
plastered
or
filled
in
with
mud
this
is
done
only
where
there
is
a
scarcity
of
water
it
is
the
aim
of
the
beaver
to
raise
the
water
in
the
pond
to
a
certain
height
and
there
maintain
it
the
chief
purpose
of
the
dam
being
to
regulate
the
height
or
the
depth
of
the
water
the
water
in
streaming
through
new
dams
deposits
therein
quantities
of
sticks
trash
and
sediment
so
that
in
a
year
or
two
these
choke
the
holes
almost
stop
the
leakage
of
the
water
and
help
to
solidify
the
dam
the
discharge
from
dams
is
regulated
by
the
beaver
in
some
instances
water
leaks
through
a
dam
in
numerous
places
from
bottom
to
top
in
others
it
seeps
through
only
close
to
the
top
and
in
still
others
the
dam
is
so
solid
that
the
water
pours
over
the
top
in
a
thin
sheet
in
some
cases
however
instead
of
the
water
pouring
over
the
entire
length
of
the
dam
the
beaver
force
it
to
pour
over
in
a
given
stretch
at
one
end
or
the
other
or
sometimes
through
a
hole
or
tunnel
the
concentration
of
the
overflow
at
some
one
point
in
the
dam
is
commonly
done
either
for
the
purpose
of
using
it
in
transportation
or
to
force
the
water
to
outpour
on
a
spot
where
it
will
least
erode
the
foundation
of
the
dam
occasionally
beaver
compel
the
water
to
flow
round
the
end
of
a
dam
which
they
raise
sufficiently
high
for
that
purpose
sometimes
they
dig
a
for
the
water
european
beaver
appear
to
have
barely
developed
to
the
stage
rarely
did
they
build
even
a
small
unimportant
dam
nor
did
all
the
american
beaver
build
dams
at
the
time
the
beaver
population
was
most
numerous
and
widely
distributed
probably
not
more
than
half
of
them
used
the
dam
however
those
not
using
the
dam
were
living
in
places
where
the
dam
and
consequent
pond
were
not
needed
enormously
increased
the
habitable
beaver
area
there
were
and
are
thousands
of
brooks
which
each
year
cease
to
flow
for
a
period
yet
on
these
brooks
are
all
other
beaver
requirements
except
a
permanent
sufficient
by
water
is
stored
for
or
changed
and
with
the
assistance
of
canals
water
is
diverted
to
a
dry
ravine
where
a
colony
is
established
the
dam
is
the
largest
and
in
many
respects
the
most
influential
beaver
work
across
a
stream
it
is
an
inviting
thoroughfare
for
the
folk
of
the
wild
as
soon
as
a
dam
is
completed
it
becomes
a
wilderness
highway
it
is
used
day
and
night
across
it
go
bears
and
lions
rabbits
and
wolves
mice
and
porcupines
chipmunks
use
it
for
a
bridge
birds
alight
upon
it
trout
attempt
to
leap
it
and
in
the
evening
the
graceful

cast
their
reflections
with
the
willows
in
its
quiet
pond
across
it
dash

and
pursued
upon
it
take
place
battles
and
courtships
often
it
is
torn
by

death
struggles
stain
it
with
blood
many
a
drama
romantic
and
picturesque
fierce
and
wild
is
staged
upon
the
beaver
dam
the
beaver
dam
gives
new
character
to
the
landscape
it
frequently
alters
the
course
of
a
stream
and
changes
the
topography
it
introduces
water
into
the
scene
it
nourishes
new
it
brings
new
birds
it
provides
a
harbor
and
a
home
for
fish
throughout
the
changing
seasons
it
seizes
sediment
and
soil
from
the
rushing
waters
and
it
sends
water
through
subterranean
ways
to
form
and
feed
springs
which
give
bloom
to
terraces
below
it
is
a
distributor
of
the
waters
and
on
days
when
dark
clouds
are
shaken
with

the

waters

then
through
all
the
rainless
days
that
follow
it
slowly
releases
them
most
old
colonies
have
many
dams
and
ponds
a
dam
is
sometimes
built
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
water
back
and
to
one
side
into
a
grove
that
is
to
be
harvested
for
food
in
many
cases
water
flows
round
the
end
of
a
dam
and
in
making
its
way
back
to
the
main
channel
is
intercepted
by
another
dam
then
another
and
thus
the
water
from
one
small
brook
maintains
a
cluster
or
chain
of
pondlets
the
majority
of
beaver
dams
are
as
crooked
as
a
river
course
now
and
then
one
is
straight
a
few
are
built
from
shore
to
a
boulder
from
the
boulder
to
a
and
finally
perhaps
from
to
some
outstretching
peninsula
on
the
further
shore
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
short
dam
to
be
built
and
afterwards
lengthened
with
additions
on
each
end
which
may
curve
either
down
or
up
stream
sometimes
a
dam
is
built
outward
from
opposite
shores
simultaneously
by
separate
but
coöperating
crews
of
beaver
in
swift
water
these
ends
are
forced
downstream
in
building
so
that
when
they
are
finally
joined
midstream
the
dam
curves
noticeably
downstream
on
one
occasion
i
watched
beaver
commence
and
complete
a
dam
in
moderately
swift
water
that
when
finished
bowed
strongly
this
however
was
not
the
intention
of
the
builders
the
material
for
this
dam
consisted
of
willow
and
alder
poles
that
were
cut
some
distance
upstream
these
were
floated
down
as
used
this
dam
was
begun
against
a
huge
boulder
near
midstream
and
built
outward
simultaneously
toward
both
shores
despite
the
repeated
efforts
of
the
builders
to
extend
it
in
a
straight
line
to
the
shore
the
flow
of
the
water
pushed
these
outbuilding
ends
downward
and
when
they
finally
reached
the
shore
this
feet
of
dam
with
the
boulder
for
a
keystone
had
an
arch
that
was
about
fifteen
feet
in
advance
of
the
bases
not
far
from
where
i
lived
in
the
mountains
when
a
boy
the
beaver
built
a
dam
this
had
a
slight
arch
upstream
a
few
years
later
the
dam
was
doubled
in
length
by
building
an
extension
on
the
end
which
bowed
downstream
it
thus
stood
a
reverse
curve
later
the
dam
was
still
further
lengthened
by
a
comparatively
straight
stretch
on
one
end
and
by
a
short
stretch
on
the
other
recent
additions
to
this
dam
consist
of
wings
at
the
end
which
sweep
upstream
the
dam
as
it
now
stands
reaches
about
three
fourths
of
the
way
around
the
pond
which
it
forms
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
dam
to
be
planned
and
built
with
an
arch
against
the
current
or
against
the
water
which
it
afterwards
impounds
the
most
interesting
dam
of
this
kind
that
i
ever
saw
was
one
across
the
narrow
neck
of
a
rudely
basin
that
was
about
two
hundred
feet
in
length
the
material
for
this
dam
came
from
a
grove
of
aspens
that
extended
into
one
side
of
the
basin
the
floor
of
this
basin
was
partly
covered
with
a
few
inches
of
water
in
starting
the
dam
the
beaver
evidently
knew
where
they
wanted
to
build
it
this
was
not
by
the
aspen
grove
where
the
materials
were
convenient
where
the
dam
would
need
to
be
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
long
but
was
about
fifty
feet
farther
on
where
a
dam
of
only
forty
feet
was
required
this
dam
when
completed
bowed
seven
feet
against
the
enclosed
water
the
beaver
commenced
building
at
the
end
nearest
the
grove
of
aspens
pulling
and
dragging
the
poles
the
fifty
feet
to
it
they
laid
these
aspen
poles
which
were
two
to
five
inches
in
diameter
and
from
four
to
twelve
feet
in
length
at
right
angles
to
the
length
of
the
dam
and
usually
placed
the
large
end
upstream
or
against
the
current
but
the
water
was
shallow
and
the
transportation
of
these
poles
to
the
dam
was
difficult
accordingly
a
ditch
or
canal
was
dug
from
the
grove
to
the
place
by
the
dam
where
the
work
was
going
on
this
ditch
was
about
inches
wide
and
fifteen
deep
the
waters
filled
it
and
thereby
afforded
an
easy
means
of
floating
or
transporting
the
poles
from
the
grove
to
the
place
where
they
were
being
used
this
ditch
was
carried
forward
along
the
upper
line
of
the
dam
and
several
feet
in
advance
of
the
spot
where
the
outbuilding
work
was
advancing
upon
the
earth
thrown
up
from
this
were
laid
the
upper
or
high
ends
of
the
poles
when
the
dam
was
finally
completed
it
was
approximately
eight
feet
wide
on
the
base
and
stood
four
feet
high
as
soon
as
it
was
completed
the
beaver
stuffed
the
with
mud
and
grass
roots
which
were
obtained
by
digging
from
the
construction
ditch
immediately
in
front
of
the
dam
in
other
words
they
enlarged
their
ditch
above
the
dam
into
a
deeper
and
wider
channel
and
used
this
excavated
material
for
strengthening
and
waterproofing
the
dam
the
longest
beaver
dam
that
i
have
ever
seen
or
measured
was
on
the
jefferson
river
near
three
forks
montana
this
was
feet
long
most
of
it
was
old
more
than
half
of
it
was
less
than
six
feet
in
height
two
short
sections
of
it
however
were
feet
wide
at
the
base
five
on
top
and
fourteen
feet
high

feet
long
harvest
time
with
beavers
one
autumn
i
watched
a
beaver
colony
and
observed
the
customs
of
its
primitive
inhabitants
as
they
gathered
their
harvest
for
winter
it
was
the
spruce
tree
colony
the
most
attractive
of
the
sixteen
beaver
municipalities
on
the
big
moraine
on
the
slope
of
long
peak
the
first
evening
i
concealed
myself
close
to
the
beaver
house
by
the
edge
of
the
pond
just
at
sunset
a
large
aged
beaver
of
striking
patriarchal
appearance
rose
in
the
water
by
the
house
and
swam
slowly
silently
round
the
pond
he
kept
close
to
the
shore
and
appeared
to
be
scouting
to
see
if
an
enemy
lurked
near
on
completing
the
circuit
of
the
pond
he
climbed
upon
the
end
of
a
log
that
was
thrust
a
few
feet
out
into
the
water
presently
several
other
beaver
appeared
in
the
water
close
to
the
house
a
few
of
these
at
once
left
the
pond
and
nosed
quietly
about
on
the
shore
the
others
swam
about
for
some
minutes
and
then
joined
their
comrades
on
land
where
all
rested
for
a
time
meanwhile
the
aged
beaver
had
lifted
a
small
aspen
limb
out
of
the
water
and
was
squatted
on
the
log
leisurely
eating
bark
before
many
minutes
elapsed
the
other
beavers
became
restless
and
finally
started
up
the
slope
in
a
runway
they
traveled
slowly
in
single
file
and
one
by
one
vanished
amid
the
tall
sedge
the
old
beaver
slipped
noiselessly
into
the
water
and
a
series
of
low
waves
pointed
toward
the
house
it
was
dark
as
i
stole
away
in
silence
for
the
night
and
mars
was
gently
throbbing
in
the
black
water
this
was
an
old
beaver
settlement
and
the
numerous
harvests
gathered
by
its
inhabitants
had
long
since
exhausted
the
growths
of
aspen
the
bark
of
which
is
the
favorite
food
of
north
american
beaver
though
the
bark
of
the
willow
cottonwood
alder
and
birch
is
also
eaten
an
examination
of
the
aspen
supply
together
with
the
lines
of
transportation
the
runways
canals
and
ponds
indicated
that
this
year
harvest
would
have
to
be
brought
a
long
distance
the
place
it
would
come
from
was
an
aspen
grove
far
up
the
slope
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
main
house
and
perhaps
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
it
in
this
grove
i
cut
three
notches
in
the
trunks
of
several
trees
to
enable
me
to
identify
them
whether
in
the
garnered
pile
by
a
house
or
along
the
line
of
transportation
to
it
the
grounds
of
this
colony
occupied
several
acres
on
a
terraced
moderately
steep
slope
of
a
mountain
moraine
along
one
side
rushed
a
swift
stream
on
which
the
colonists
maintained
three
but
little
used
ponds
on
the
opposite
side
were
the
slope
and
summit
of
the
moraine
there
was
a
large
pond
at
the
bottom
and
one
or
two
small
ponds
or
basins
dotted
each
of
the
five
terraces
which
rose
above
the
entire
grounds
were
perforated
with
subterranean
passageways
or
tunnels
beaver
commonly
fill
their
ponds
by
damming
a
brook
or
a
river
but
this
colony
obtained
most
of
its
from
springs
which
poured
forth
abundantly
on
the
uppermost
terrace
where
the
water
was
led
into
one
pond
and
a
number
of
basins
overflowing
from
these
it
either
made
a
merry
little
cascade
or
went
to
lubricate
a
slide
on
the
short
slopes
which
led
to
the
ponds
on
the
terrace
below
the
waters
from
all
terraces
were
gathered
into
a
large
pond
at
the
bottom
this
pond
measured
six
hundred
feet
in
circumference
the
crooked
and
almost
encircling
dam
was
six
feet
high
and
four
hundred
feet
long
in
its
upper
edge
stood
the
main
house
which
was
eight
feet
high
and
forty
feet
in
circumference
there
was
also
another
house
on
one
of
the
terraces
after
notching
the
aspens
i
spent
some
time
exploring
the
colony
grounds
and
did
not
return
to
the
marked
trees
until
hours
had
elapsed
harvest
had
begun
and
one
of
the
largest
notched
trees
had
been
felled
and
removed
its
gnawed
stump
was
six
inches
in
diameter
and
stood
fifteen
inches
high
the
limbs
had
been
trimmed
off
and
a
number
of
these
lay
scattered
about
the
stump
the
trunk
which
must
have
been
about
eighteen
feet
long
had
disappeared
cut
into
lengths
of
from
three
to
six
feet
probably
and
started
toward
the
harvest
pile
wondering
for
which
house
these
logs
were
intended
i
followed
hoping
to
trace
and
trail
them
to
the
house
or
find
them
from
the
spot
where
they
were
cut
they
had
evidently
been
rolled
down
a
steep
grassy
slope
at
the
bottom
of
this
dragged
an
equal
distance
over
a
level
stretch
among
some
pines
and
then
pushed
or
dragged
along
a
narrow
runway
that
had
been
cut
through
a
rank
growth
of
willows
once
through
the
willows
they
were
pushed
into
the
uppermost
pond
they
were
taken
across
this
forced
over
the
dam
on
the
opposite
side
and
shot
down
a
slide
into
the
pond
which
contained
the
smaller
house
only
hours
before
the
little
logs
which
i
was
following
were
in
a
tree
and
now
i
expected
to
find
them
by
this
house
it
was
good
work
to
have
got
them
here
so
quickly
i
thought
but
no
logs
could
be
found
by
the
house
or
in
the
pond
the
folks
at
this
place
had
not
yet
laid
up
anything
for
winter
the
logs
must
have
gone
farther
on
the
opposite
side
of
this
pond
i
found
where
the
logs
had
been
dragged
across
the
broad
dam
and
then
heaved
into
a
long
wet
slide
which
landed
them
in
a
small
shallow
harbor
in
the
grass
from
this
point
a
canal
about
eighty
feet
long
ran
around
the
brow
of
the
terrace
and
ended
at
the
top
of
a
long
slide
which
reached
to
the
big
pond
this
canal
was
new
and
probably
had
been
dug
especially
for
this
harvest
for
sixty
feet
of
its
length
it
was
quite
regular
in
form
and
had
an
average
width
of
thirty
inches
and
a
depth
of
fourteen
the
mud
dug
in
making
it
was
piled
evenly
along
the
lower
side
altogether
it
looked
more
like
the
work
of
a
careful
man
with
a
shovel
than
of
beaver
without
tools
seepage
and
overflow
from
the
ponds
above
filled
and
flowed
slowly
through
it
and
out
at
the
farther
end
where
it
swept
down
the
long
slide
into
the
big
pond
through
this
canal
the
logs
had
been
taken
one
by
one
at
the
farther
end
i
found
the
log
it
probably
had
been
too
heavy
to
heave
out
of
the
canal
but
tracks
in
the
mud
indicated
that
there
was
a
hard
tussle
before
it
was
abandoned
the
pile
of
winter
supplies
was
started
close
to
the
big
house
a
few
aspen
leaves
fluttered
on
twigs
in
the
water
evidently
these
twigs
were
attached
to
limbs
or
larger
pieces
of
aspen
that
were
piled
beneath
the
surface
could
it
be
that
the
aspen
which
i
had
marked
on
the
mountainside
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
so
short
a
time
before
and
which
i
had
followed
over
slope
and
slide
through
canal
and
basin
was
now
piled
on
the
bottom
of
this
pond
i
waded
out
into
the
water
prodded
about
with
a
pole
and
found
several
smaller
logs
dragging
one
of
these
to
the
surface
i
found
there
were
three
notches
in
it
evidently
these
heavy
green
tree
cuttings
had
been
sunk
to
the
bottom
simply
by
the
piling
of
other
similar
cuttings
upon
them
with
this
heavy
material
in
the
still
water
a
slight
contact
with
the
bottom
would
prevent
the
drifting
of
accumulated
cuttings
until
a
heavy
pile
could
be
formed
however
in
deep
or
swift
water
i
have
noticed
that
an
anchorage
for
the
first
few
pieces
was
secured
by
placing
these
upon
the
lower
slope
of
the
house
or
against
the
dam
scores
of
aspens
were
felled
in
the
grove
where
the
notched
ones
were
they
were
trimmed
cut
into
sections
and
limbs
logs
and
all
taken
over
the
route
of
the
one
i
had
followed
and
at
last
placed
in
a
pile
beside
the
big
house
this
went
on
for
a
month
all
about
was
busy
earnest
preparation
for
winter
the
squirrels
from
the
kept
a
rattling
rain
of
cones
on
the
forest
floor
the
cheery
chipmunk
foraged
and
frolicked
among
the
withered
leaves
and
plants
while
aspens
with
leaves
of
gold
fell
before
the
ivory
sickles
of
the
beaver
splendid
glimpses
grand
views
i
had
of
this
strange
how
busy
the
beavers
were
they
were
busy
in
the
grove
on
the
steep
mountainside
they
tugged
logs
across
the
runways
they
hurried
them
across
the
wrestled
with
them
in
canals
and
merrily
piled
them
by
the
rude
house
in
the
water
and
i
watched
them
through
the
changing
hours
i
saw
their
shadowy
activity
in
the
starry
silent
night
i
saw
them
hopefully
leave
home
for
the
harvest
groves
in
the
serene
twilight
and
i
watched
them
working
busily
in
the
light
of
the
noonday
sun
most
of
the
aspens
were
cut
off
between
thirteen
and
fifteen
inches
above
the
ground
a
few
stumps
were
less
than
five
inches
high
while
a
number
were
four
feet
high
these
high
cuttings
were
probably
made
from
reclining
trunks
of
lodged
aspens
which
were
afterward
removed
the
average
diameter
of
the
aspens
cut
was
four
and
one
half
inches
at
the
top
of
the
stump
numerous
seedlings
of
an
inch
diameter
were
cut
and
the
largest
tree
felled
for
this
harvest
measured
fourteen
inches
across
the
stump
this
had
been
laid
low
only
a
few
hours
before
i
found
it
and
a
bushel
of
white
chips
and
cuttings
encircled
the
lifeless
stump
like
a
wreath
in
falling
the
top
had
become
entangled
in
an
alder
thicket
and
lodged
six
feet
from
the
ground
it
remained
in
this
position
for
several
days
and
was
apparently
abandoned
but
the
last
time
i
went
to
see
it
the
alders
which
upheld
it
were
being
cut
away
although
the
alders
were
thick
upon
the
ground
only
those
which
had
upheld
the
aspen
had
been
cut
it
may
be
that
the
beaver
which
felled
them
looked
and
thought
before
they
went
ahead
with
this
cutting
why
had
this
and
several
other
large
aspens
been
left
uncut
in
a
place
where
all
were
convenient
for
harvest
all
other
neighboring
aspens
were
cut
years
ago
one
explanation
is
that
the
beaver
realized
that
the
tops
of
the
aspens
were
entangled
and
interlocked
in
the
limbs
of
crowding
spruces
and
would
not
fall
if
cut
off
at
the
bottom
this
and
one
other
aspen
were
the
only
large
ones
that
were
felled
and
the
tops
of
these
had
been
recently
released
by
the
overturning
of
some
spruces
and
the
breaking
of
several
branches
on
others
other
scattered
large
aspens
were
left
uncut
but
all
of
these
were
clasped
in
the
arms
of
spruces
it
was
the
habit
of
these
colonists
to
transfer
a
tree
to
the
harvest
pile
promptly
after
cutting
it
down
but
one
morning
i
found
logs
on
slides
and
in
canals
and
unfinished
work
in
the
grove
as
though
everything
had
been
suddenly
dropped
in
the
night
when
work
was
at
its
height
coyotes
had
howled
freely
during
the
night
but
this
was
not
uncommon
in
going
over
the
grounds
i
found
the
explanation
of
this
untidy
work
in
a
bear
track
and
numerous
wolf
tracks
freshly
moulded
in
the
muddy
places
after
the
bulk
of
the
harvest
was
gathered
i
went
one
day
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
moraine
and
briefly
observed
the
methods
of
the
island
beaver
colony
the
ways
of
the
two
colonies
were
in
some
things
very
different
in
the
spruce
tree
colony
the
custom
was
to
move
the
felled
aspen
promptly
to
the
harvest
pile
in
the
island
colony
the
custom
was
to
cut
down
most
of
the
harvest
before
transporting
any
of
it
to
the
pile
beside
the
house
of
the
one
hundred
and
trees
that
had
been
felled
for
this
harvest
one
hundred
and
were
still
lying
where
they
fell
however
the
work
of
transporting
was
getting
under
way
a
few
logs
were
in
the
pile
beside
the
house
and
numerous
others
were
scattered
along
the
canals
runways
and
slides
between
the
house
and
the
harvest
grove
illustration
the
spruce
tree
house
and
october
there
was
more
wasted
labor
too
in
the
island
colony
this
was
noticeable
in
the
attempts
that
had
been
made
to
fell
trees
that
could
not
fall
one
aspen
had
three
times
been
cut
off
at
the
bottom
the
third
cut
was
more
than
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
was
made
by
a
beaver
working
from
the
top
of
a
fallen
log
still
this
aspen
refused
to
come
down
and
there
it
hung
like
a
collapsed
balloon
entangled
in
prowling
hunters
have
compelled
most
beaver
to
work
at
night
but
the
spruce
tree
colony
was
an
isolated
one
and
occasionally
its
members
worked
and
even
played
in
the
sunshine
each
day
i
secluded
myself
kept
still
and
waited
and
on
a
few
occasions
watched
them
as
they
worked
in
the
light
one
windy
day
just
as
i
was
unroping
myself
from
the
shaking
limb
of
a
spruce
i
saw
four
beaver
plodding
along
in
single
file
beneath
they
had
come
out
of
a
hole
between
the
roots
of
the
spruce
at
an
aspen
growth
about
fifty
feet
distant
they
separated
though
they
had
been
closely
assembled
each
appeared
utterly
oblivious
of
the
presence
of
the
others
one
squatted
on
the
ground
by
an
aspen
took
a
bite
of
bark
out
of
it
and
ate
leisurely
by
and
by
he
rose
clasped
the
aspen
with
fore
paws
and
began
to
bite
chips
from
it
systematically
he
was
deliberately
cutting
it
down
the
most
aged
beaver
waddled
near
an
aspen
gazed
into
its
top
for
a
few
seconds
then
moved
away
about
ten
feet
and
started
to
fell
a
aspen
the
one
rejected
was
entangled
at
the
top
presently
the
third
beaver
selected
a
tree
and
after
some
trouble
in
getting
comfortably
seated
or
squatted
also
began
cutting
the
fourth
beaver
disappeared
and
i
did
not
see
him
again
while
i
was
looking
for
this
one
the
huge
aged
beaver
whose
venerable
appearance
had
impressed
me
the
first
evening
appeared
on
the
scene
he
came
out
of
a
hole
beneath
some
spruces
about
a
hundred
feet
distant
he
looked
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
nor
up
nor
down
as
he
ambled
toward
the
aspen
growth
when
about
halfway
there
he
wheeled
suddenly
and
took
an
uneasy
survey
of
the
open
he
had
traversed
as
though
he
had
heard
an
enemy
behind
then
with
apparently
stolid
indifference
he
went
on
leisurely
and
for
a
time
paused
among
the
cutters
which
did
nothing
to
indicate
that
they
realized
his
presence
he
ate
some
bark
from
a
green
limb
on
the
ground
moved
on
and
went
into
the
hole
beneath
me
he
appeared
so
large
that
i
afterward
measured
the
distance
between
the
two
aspens
where
he
paused
he
was
not
less
than
three
and
a
half
feet
long
and
probably
weighed
fifty
pounds
he
had
all
his
toes
there
was
no
white
spot
on
his
body
in
fact
there
was
neither
mark
nor
blemish
by
which
i
could
positively
identify
him
yet
i
feel
that
in
my
month
around
the
colony
i
beheld
the
patriarch
of
the
first
evening
in
several
scenes
of
action
minutes
after
the
second
beaver
began
cutting
he
made
a
brief
pause
then
he
suddenly
thudded
the
ground
with
his
tail
hurriedly
took
out
a
few
more
chips
and
ran
away
with
the
other
two
beaver
a
little
in
advance
just
as
his
aspen
settled
over
and
fell
all
paused
for
a
time
close
to
the
hole
beneath
me
and
then
the
old
beaver
returned
to
his
work
the
one
that
had
felled
his
tree
followed
closely
and
at
once
began
on
another
aspen
the
other
beaver
with
his
aspen
half
cut
off
went
into
the
hole
and
did
not
again
come
out
by
and
by
an
old
and
a
young
beaver
came
out
of
the
hole
the
young
one
at
once
began
cutting
limbs
off
the
recently
felled
aspen
while
the
other
began
work
on
the
tree
but
he
ignored
the
work
already
done
and
finally
severed
the
trunk
about
four
inches
above
the
cut
made
by
the
other
suddenly
the
old
beaver
whacked
the
ground
and
ran
but
at
thirty
feet
distant
he
paused
and
nervously
thumped
the
ground
with
his
tail
as
his
aspen
slowly
settled
and
fell
then
he
went
into
the
hole
beneath
me
this
year
harvest
was
so
much
larger
than
usual
that
it
may
be
the
population
of
this
colony
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
emigrants
from
a
persecuted
colony
down
in
the
valley
the
total
harvest
numbered
four
hundred
and
trees
these
made
a
harvest
pile
four
feet
high
and
ninety
feet
in
circumference
a
thick
covering
of
willows
was
placed
on
top
of
the
harvest
pile
i
can
not
tell
for
what
reason
unless
it
was
to
sink
all
the
aspens
below
reach
of
the
ice
this
bulk
of
stores
together
with
numerous
roots
of
willow
and
water
plants
which
are
eaten
in
the
water
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
would
support
a
numerous
beaver
population
through
the
days
of
ice
and
snow
when
i
took
my
last
tour
through
the
colony
everything
was
ready
for
the
long
and
cold
winter
dams
were
in
repair
and
ponds
were
brimming
over
with
water
the
fresh
coats
of
mud
on
the
houses
were
freezing
to
defy
enemies
and
a
bountiful
harvest
was
home
is
full
of
hope
and
romance
what
a
joy
it
must
be
to
every
man
or
animal
who
has
a
hand
in
it
what
a
satisfaction
too
for
all
dependent
upon
a
harvest
to
know
that
there
is
abundance
stored
for
all
the
frosty
days
the
people
of
this
wild
strange
picturesque
colony
had
planned
and
prepared
well
i
wished
them
a
winter
unvisited
by
cruel
fate
or
foe
and
trusted
that
when
june
came
again
the
fat
and
furry
young
beavers
would
play
with
the
aged
one
amid
the
tiger
lilies
in
the
shadows
of
the
big
spruce
trees
transportation
facilities
two
successive
dry
years
had
greatly
reduced
the
of
lily
lake
and
the
consequent
shallowness
of
the
water
made
a
serious
situation
for
its
beaver
inhabitants
this
lake
covered
about
ten
acres
and
was
four
feet
deep
in
the
deepest
part
while
over
nine
tenths
of
the
area
the
water
was
two
feet
or
less
in
depth
it
was
supplied
by
springs
early
in
the
autumn
of
the
water
completely
disappeared
from
about
one
half
of
the
area
and
most
of
the
remainder
became
so
shallow
that
beaver
could
no
longer
swim
beneath
the
surface
this
condition
exposed
them
to
the
attack
of
enemies
and
made
the
transportation
of
supplies
to
the
house
slow
and
difficult
in
the
lake
the
beaver
had
dug
an
extensive
system
of
deep
canals
the
work
of
years
by
means
of
these
deep
canals
the
beaver
were
able
to
use
the
place
until
the
last
for
these
were
full
of
water
even
after
the
was
completely
exposed
one
day
in
october
while
passing
the
lake
i
noticed
a
coyote
on
the
farther
shore
stop
suddenly
prick
up
his
ears
and
give
alert
attention
to
an
agitated
forward
movement
in
the
shallow
water
of
a
canal
then
he
plunged
into
the
water
and
endeavored
to
seize
a
beaver
that
was
struggling
forward
through
water
that
was
too
shallow
for
his
heavy
body
although
this
beaver
made
his
escape
other
members
of
the
colony
may
not
have
been
so
fortunate
the
drouth
continued
and
by
the
lake
went
entirely
dry
except
in
the
canals
off
in
one
corner
stood
the
beaver
house
a
tiny
rounded
and
solitary
hill
in
the
miniature
black
plain
of
with
one
exception
the
beaver
abandoned
the
site
and
moved
on
to
other
scenes
i
know
not
where
one
old
beaver
remained
whether
he
did
this
through
the
fear
of
not
being
equal
to
the
overland
journey
across
the
dry
rocky
ridge
and
down
into
wind
river
or
whether
from
deep
love
of
the
old
home
associations
no
one
can
say
but
he
remained
and
endeavored
to
make
provision
for
the
oncoming
winter
close
to
the
house
he
dug
or
enlarged
a
well
that
was
about
six
feet
in
diameter
and
four
feet
in
depth
seepage
filled
this
hole
and
into
it
he
piled
a
number
of
green
aspen
chunks
and
cuttings
a
meagre
for
the
long
cold
winter
that
followed

began
in

which
the
beaver
had

could
be
plainly
seen
and
examined
the
magnitude
of
the
work
which
the
beaver
had
performed
in
making
these
is
beyond
comprehension
i
took
a
series
of
photographs
of
these
excavations
and
made
numerous
measurements
to
the
north
of
the

a

had
been
dug
that
was
three
feet

extended
from

was
thirty

from
three

throughout
this

then
northeasterly
and
for
one
hundred

was
five

in
the
remaining
six
hundred

it
was

there
were
a
number
of
minor
ditches
and
canals
connecting
the
larger
ones
and
altogether
the
extent
of
all
made
an
impressive
show
in
the
empty
meantime
the
old
beaver
had
a
hard
winter
the
cold
weather
persisted
and
finally
the
well
in
which
he
had
deposited
winter
food
froze
to
the
bottom
even
the
into
the
house
were
frozen
shut
this
sealed
him
in
the
old
fellow
whose
teeth
were
worn
and
whose
claws
were
bad
apparently
tried
in
vain
to
break
out
on
returning
from
three
months
absence
two
friends
and
i
investigated
the
old
beaver
condition
we
broke
through
the
frozen
walls
of
the
house
and
crawled
in
the
old
fellow
was
still
alive
though
greatly
emaciated
for
some
time
i
know
not
how
long
he
had
subsisted
on
the
wood
and
the
bark
of
some
green
sticks
which
had
been
built
into
an
addition
of
the
house
during
the
autumn
we
cut
several
green
aspens
into
short
lengths
and
threw
them
into
the
house
the
broken
hole
was
then
closed
the
old
fellow
accepted
these
cheerfully
for
six
weeks
aspens
were
occasionally
thrown
to
him
and
at
the
end
of
this
time
the
spring
warmth
had
melted
the
deep
snow
the
water
rose
and
filled
the
pond
and
unsealed
the
entrance
to
the
house
and
again
the
old
fellow
emerged
into
the
water
the
following
summer
he
was
joined
or
rejoined
by
a
number
of
other
beaver
in
many
localities
the
canals
or
ditches
dug
and
used
by
the
beaver
form
their
most
necessary
and
extensive
works
these
canals
require
enormous
labor
and
much
skill
in
point
of
interest
they
even
excel
the
house
and
the
dam
it
is
remarkable
that
of
the
thousands
of
stories
concerning
the
beaver
only
a
few
have
mentioned
the
beaver
canals
these
are
improvements
and
not
only
enable
the
beaver
to
live
easily
and
safely
in
places
where
he
otherwise
could
not
live
at
all
but
apparently
they
allow
him
to
live
happily
the
excavations
made
in
taking
material
for
house
or
dam
commonly
are
turned
to
useful
purpose
the
beaver
not
only
builds
his
house
but
uses
the
basin
thus
formed
in
excavating
earthy
material
for
the
house
for
a
winter
food
depository
ofttimes
too
in
building
the
dam
he
does
it
by
piling
up
the
material
dug
from
a
ditch
which
runs
parallel
and
close
to
the
dam
and
which
is
useful
to
him
as
a
deep
waterway
after
the
dam
is
completed
in
transporting
trees
for
water
transportation
is
so
much
easier
and
safer
than
land
that
wherever
the
immediate
surroundings
of
the
pond
are
comparatively
level
the
beaver
endeavors
to
lead
water
out
to
tree
groves
by
digging
a
canal
from
the
edge
of
the
pond
to
these
groves
the
felled
trees
are
by
this
means
easily
floated
into
the
pond
one
of
the
simplest
forms
of
beaver
canal
is
a
narrow
outward
extension
of
the
pond
this
varies
in
length
from
a
few
yards
to
one
hundred
feet
or
more
another
and
fairly
common
form
of
canal
is
one
that
is
built
across
low
narrow
necks
of
land
which
thrust
out
into
large
beaver
ponds
or
on
narrow
stretches
of
land
around
which
crooked
streams
wander
the
majority
of
beaver
ponds
are
comparatively
shallow
over
the
greater
portion
of
their
area
in
many
cases
it
is
not
easy
or
even
possible
to
deepen
them
they
may
be
so
shallow
that
the
pond
freezes
to
the
bottom
in
winter
except
in
its
small
deeper
portion
the
shallow
ponds
are
made
more
usable
by
a
number
of
canals
in
the
bottom
these
canals
assure
stretches
under
all
conditions
most
beaver
ponds
have
a
canal
that
closely
parallels
the
dam
in
some
instances
this
is
extended
around
the
pond
a
few
yards
inside
the
two
canals
usually
extend
from
the
house
one
of
these
connects
with
the
canal
by
the
dam
the
other
runs
to
the
place
on
the
shore
commonly
at
the
end
of
a
trail
or
slide
most
visited
by
the
beaver
in
jefferson
valley
montana
not
far
from
three
forks
i
enjoyed
the
examination
of
numerous
beaver
workings
and
made
measurements
of
the
most
interesting
system
of
beaver
canals
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
beaver
house
for
which
these
canals
did
service
was
situated
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
about
three
feet
above
the
summer
level
of
the
water
and
about
two
hundred
feet
north
of
the
hilly
edge
of
the
valley
from
the
river
a
canal
about
feet
in
length
had
been
dug
halfway
around
the
base
of
the
house
connected
with
this
was
a
basin
for
winter
food
this
was
five
feet
deep
and

in
diameter
from
this
a
canal
extended
southward
two
hundred
and
seven
feet
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
distant
from
the
house
was
a
boulder
that
was
about
ten
feet
in
diameter
this
was
imbedded
in
about
two
feet
of
soil
around
this
boulder
the
canal
made
a
detour
and
then
resumed
its
comparatively
straight
line
southward
over
the
greater
portion
of
its
length
this
canal
was
four
feet
wide
and
at
no
point
was
it
narrower
than
three
feet
its
average
depth
was
inches
for
one
hundred
and
feet
it
ran
through
an
approximately
level
stretch
of
the
valley
and
seepage
filled
it
with
water
a
low
dam
about
fifty
feet
in
length
crossed
it
at
the
one
hundred
and
mark
and
served
to
catch
and
run
seepage
water
into
it
and
also
to
act
as
a
wall
across
the
canal
to
hold
the
water
the
most
southerly
sixty
feet
of
this
canal
on
the
edge
of
the
foothills
ran
uphill
and
was
about
four
feet
deep
at
the
upper
end
four
feet
higher
than
the
end
by
the
house
the
dam
across
it
was
supplemented
by
a
wall
feet
further
on
this
wall
was
simply
a
short
dam
across
the
canal
in
a
part
that
was
inclined
and
plainly
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
water
in
the
canal
the
upper
part
of
the
canal
was
filled
with
water
by
a
streamlet
from
off
the
slope
apparently
this
canal
was
old
for
there
was
growing
on
its
banks
near
the
house
a
spruce
tree
four
inches
in
diameter
that
had
grown
since
the
canal
was
made

the
wall
or
small
dam
which
beaver
build
across
canals
that
are
inclined
represents
an
interesting
phase
of
beaver
development
that
these
walls
are
built
for
the
purpose
of
retaining
water
in
the
canal
appears
certain
they
are
most
numerous
in
canals
of
steepest
incline
though
rarely
less
than
twenty
feet
apart
i
have
not
seen
a
wall
in
an
almost
canal
except
it
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
raising
the
height
of
the
water
this
wall
or
buttress
is
after
all
but
a
dam
and
like
most
dams
it
is
built
for
the
purpose
of
raising
and
maintaining
the
level
of
water
extending
at
right
angles
westward
from
the
end
of
the
old

one
of
two

separated
and
united

one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
of
this
new
canal
ran
along
the
contour
of
a
hill
approximately
at
a
dead
level
then
came
a
wall
and
from
this
the
last
feet
extended
southward
up
a
shallow
ravine
in
this
part
there
were
two
walls
the
upper
end
of
the
extension
was
nine
feet
higher
than
the
house
and
four
hundred
and
feet
distant
from
it
the
extension
was
from
to
inches
wide
and
averaged
inches
deep
the
entire
new
part
was
supplied
with
spring
water
which
the
beaver
had
diverted
from
a
ravine
to
the
west
and
led
by
a
ditch
into
the
upper
end
of
their
canal
thirty
feet
from
the
end
of
the
canal
were
two
burrows
evidently
safe
places
into
which
the
beaver
could
retreat
in
case
of
sudden
attack
from
wolves
or
other
foe
there
were
two
other
of
these
burrows
one
at
the
outer
end
of
the
old
canal
and
the
other
alongside
the
boulder
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
from
the
house
at
the
time
i
saw
these
canals
the
only
trees
near
were
those
of
an
aspen
grove
which
surrounded
the
extreme
end
it
was
autumn
and
on
both
tributary
slopes
by
the
end
of
the
canal
aspens
were
being
cut
dragged
and
rolled
down
these
slopes
into
the
upper
end
of
the
canal
then
floated
through
its
waters
dragged
over
and
across
the
walls
and
at
last
piled
up
for
winter
food
in
the
basin
by
the
house
in
all
probability
this
long
large
canal
had
been
built
a
few
yards
at
a
time
being
extended
as
the
trees
were
cut
down
and
used
where
beaver
long
inhabit
a
locality
it
is
not
uncommon
for
them
to
have
two
or
three
distinct
and
trails
from
points
on
the
water
edge
which
lead
into
neighboring
groves
or
these
are
the
beaten
tracks
traveled
by
the
beaver
as
they
go
forth
from
the
water
for
food
and
over
which
they
drag
their
trees
and
saplings
into
the
water
on
steep
slopes
by
the
water
these
are
called

this
name
is
also
given
to
places
in
the
dam
over
which
beaver
frequently
pass
in
their
outgoings
and
incomings
commonly
these
trails
avoid
ridges
and
ground
swells
by
keeping
in
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
logs
are
cut
through
and
rolled
out
of
the
way
or

are
removed
or
a

way
made
round

their
log
roads
compare
favorably
with
the
log
roads
of
woodsmen
who
cut
with
steel
instead
of
enamel
in
most
old
beaver
colonies
where
the
character
of
the
bottom
of
the
pond
permits
it
there
are
two
or
more
tunnels
or
subways
beneath
the
floor
of
the
principal
pond
the
main
tunnel
begins
close
to
the
foundation
of
the
house
and
penetrates
the
earth
a
foot
or
more
beneath
the
water
to
a
point
on
land
a
few
feet
beyond
the
if
there
are
a
number
of
small
ponds
in
a
colony
that
are
separated
by
fingers
of
land
it
is
not
uncommon
for
these
bits
of
land
to
be
penetrated
by
a
thoroughfare
tunnel
these
tunnels
through
the
separating
bits
of
land
enable
the
beaver
to
go
from
one
pond
to
another
without
exposing
themselves
to
dangers
on
land
and
also
offer
an
easy
means
of
intercommunication
between
ponds
when
these
are
pond
subways
also
afford
a
place
of
refuge
or
a
means
of
escape
in
case
the
house
is
destroyed
the
dam
broken
or
the
pond
drained
or
in
case
the
pond
should
freeze
to
the
bottom
commonly
these
are
full
of
water
but
some
are
empty
on
the
missouri
and
other
rivers
where
there
are
several
feet
of

edge
to

most
of
this
tunnel
work
is
hidden
and
remains
unknown
a
striking
example
was
in
the
spruce
tree
colony
elsewhere
described
these
colonists
apparently
disgusted
by
having
their

hundred
yards
up
the
slope
and
perhaps
one
hundred
feet
above
trickled
down
and
in
due
time
formed
a
pond
the
following
year
this
pond
was
enlarged
and
another
one
built
upon
a
terrace
about
one
hundred
feet
up
the
slope
from
year
to
year
there
were
enlargements
of
the
old
pond
and
the
building
of
new
pondlets
until
there
were
seven
on
the
terraces
of
this
moraine
these
together
with
the
connecting
slides
and
canals
required
more
water
than
the
spring
supplied
especially
in
the
autumn
when
the
beaver
were
floating
their
winter
supplies
from
pond
to
pond
within
the
colony
area
too
were
many
underground
passages
or
subway
tunnels
one
of
these
penetrated
the
turf
beneath
the
willows
for
more
than
two
hundred
feet
while
watching
the
autumnal
activities
of
this
colony
as
described
in
another
chapter
i
broke
through
the
surface
and
plunged
my
leg
into
an
underground
channel
or
subway
that
was
half
filled
with
water
taking
pains
to
trace
this
stream
downward
i
found
that
it
emptied
into
the
uppermost
of
the
ponds
along
with
the
waters
from
a
small
spring
then
tracing
the
channel
upwards
i
found
that
about
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
distant
from
the
uppermost
pond
it
connected
with
the
waters
of
the
brook
on
which
the
old
colony
formerly
had
a
place
this
tunnel
over
most
of
its
course
was
about
two
feet
beneath
the
surface
was
fourteen
inches
in
diameter
and
ran
beneath
the
roots
of
spruce
trees
the
water
which
the
tunnel
led
from
the
brook
plainly
was
being
used
to
increase
the
supply
needed
in
the
canals
ponds
and
pools
of
the
spruce
tree
colony
the
intake
of
this
was
in
a
tiny
pond
which
the
beaver
had
formed
by
a
damlet
across
the
brook
that
this
increased
supply
of
water
was
of
great
advantage
to
the
busy
and
populous
spruce
tree
colony
there
can
be
no
doubt
was
this
tunnel
planned
and
made
for
this
especial
purpose
or
was
the
increased
of
the
colony
the
result
of
accident
by
the
brook
breaking
into
this
subway
tunnel
the
canals
which
beaver
dig
the
slides
which
they
use
the
trails
which
they
clear
and
establish
conclusively
show
that
these
animals
appreciate
the
importance
of
good
waterways
and
good
roads
in
other
words
good
transportation
facilities
the
primitive
house
the
lily
lake
beaver
house
in
which
the
old
beaver
spent
the
drouthy
winter
was
a
large
roughly
rounded
affair
that
measured
feet
in
diameter
it
rose
only
four
feet
above
the
normal
this
house
had
been
three
times
altered
and
enlarged
and
once
raised
in
height
its
mud
walls
were
heavily
reinforced
with
polelike
sticks
which
were
placed
at
the
junctures
of
the
enlargements
the
one
large
room
was
more
than
twelve
feet
in
diameter
near
the
centre
stood
a
support
for
the
upper
part
of
the
house
this
support
was
about
one
and
a
half
by
two
and
a
half
feet
and
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
sticks
but
few
houses
have
this
support
commonly
the
room
is
vaulted
the
room
itself
averaged
two
and
a
half
feet
high
it
had
four
entrances
a
house
commonly
has
two
entrances
but
it
may
have
only
one
or
as
many
as
five
thus
the
way
to
the
outer
world
from
the
inside
of
the
house
is
through
one
or
more
inclined
passageways
or
tunnels
the
upper
opening
of
these
entrances
is
in
the
floor
a
few
inches
above
the
and
the
lower
opening
in
the
bottom
of
the
pond
under
about
three
feet
of
water
these
extend
at
an
angle
through
the
solid
foundation
of
the
house
are
about
one
foot
in
diameter
and
four
to
fifteen
feet
long
and
are
full
of
water
almost
to
this
dark
windowless
hut
has
no
other
entrance
most
beaver
houses
stand
in
a
pond
though
a
number
are
built
on
the
shore
and
partly
in
the
water
and
still
others
on
the
bank
a
few
feet
away
from
the
water
the
external
appearance
and
internal
construction
of
the
houses
are
in
a
general
way
the
same
regardless
of
the
situation
or
size
most
beaver
houses
appear
conical
measured
on
the
they
are
commonly
found
to
be
slightly
elliptical
the
diameter
on
the
is
from
five
to
feet
and
the
height
above
water
is
from
three
to
seven
feet
a
house
may
be
built
almost
entirely
of
sticks
or
of
a
few
sticks
with
a
larger
proportion
of
mud
and
turf
in
building
a
small
opening
is
left
or
built
around
and
over
which
is
afterwards
enlarged
into
a
room
houses
that
are
built
in
a
pond
usually
stand
in
three
or
four
feet
of
water
the
foundation
is
laid
on
the
bottom
of
the
pond
of
the
size
intended
for
the
house
and
built
up
a
solid
mass
to
a
few
inches
above
this
foundation
is
covered
with
a
crude
hemisphere
or
house
the
central
portion
of
the
foundation
forming
the
floor
of
the
room
which
is
enclosed
by
the
thick
in
building
the
house
the
beaver
provide
a
temporary
support
for
the
combined
roof
and
walls
by
piling
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
a
mound
of
mud
over
this
is
placed
a
somewhat
flattened
or
frame
of
sticks
and
small
poles
these
stand
on
the
outer
part
of
the
foundation
and
lean
inward
with
upper
ends
meeting
against
and
above
the
temporary
support
the
beaver
then
cover
this
framework
with
two
or
three
feet
of
mud
brush
and
turf
and
thus
make
the
walls
and
the
roof
of
the
house
when
the
outer
part
of
the
house
is
completed
they
dig
an
inclined
passageway
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
up
through
the
foundation
into
the
irregular
space
left
between
the
supporting
pile
of
mud
and
the
walls
and
of
this
space
they
shape
a
room
by
clawing
out
the
temporary
support
and
gnawing
off
the
intruding
sticks
this
represents
the
most
highly
developed
type
of
beaver
house
in
most
houses
the
temporary
support
is
not
used
but
a
part
of
the
wall
is
carried
up
to
completion
and
against
it
are
leaned
sticks
which
rest
upon
the
edge
of
the
remaining
foundation
a
finished
house
of
this
kind
has
a
slightly
elliptical
outline
however
many
a
house
is
a
crude
haphazard
pile
of
material
in
which
a
room
has
been
burrowed
the
room
is
from
one
to
three
feet
high
and
from
three
to
twenty
feet
across
the
room
is
a
kind
of
a
burrow
and
is
without
either
door
or
window
sticks
make
a
comparatively
dry
floor
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
only
a
few
inches
above
beaver
sleep
on
the
floor
usually
with
tail
bent
along
the
side
after
the
fashion
of
a
dozing
cat
in
a
nest
of
shredded
wood
which
they
patiently
make
by
thinly
splitting
and
paring
pieces
of
wood
just
why
this
kind
of
bedding
is
used
can
not
be
said
but
probably
because
this
material
dries
more
quickly
is
more
comfortable
and
more
sanitary
and
harbors
fewer
parasites
however
a
few
beds
are
made
of
grass
leaves
or
moss
but
little
earthy
matter
is
used
in
the
of
the
house
where
the
minute
disjointed
between
the
interlaced
poles
give
the
room
scanty
ventilation
except
in
a
few
cases
where
are
overgrown
with
willows
or
grass
the
erosive
action
of
wind
and
water
rapidly
thins
and
weakens
them
hence
the
house
must
receive
frequent
repairs
each
autumn
it
is
plastered
or
piled
all
over
with
sticks
or
mud
the
mud
covering
varies
in
thickness
from
two
to
six
inches
the
mud
for
this
purpose
is
usually
dredged
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
close
to
the
foundation
of
the
house
it
is
carried
up
a
double
handful
at
a
time
the
beaver
waddling
on
his
hind
legs
as
he
holds
it
with
his
fore
paws
against
his
breast
a
or
more
beaver
may
be
carrying
mud
up
at
once
the
covering
not
only
thickens
the
walls
and
increases
the
warmth
of
the
house
but
also
freezes
and
becomes
an
armor
of
stone
that
is
impregnable
to
most
beaver
enemies
the
mudding
of
the
house
is
a
part
of
the
natural
and
necessary
preparation
for
winter
it
may
also
be
a
special
means
of
protection
deliberately
carried
out
by
the
beaver
the
fact
that
an
occasional
or
beaver
house
was
not
thus
plastered
in
autumn
perhaps
because
it
did
not
need
it
has
led
a
few
people
to
affirm
that
beaver
houses
are
not
in
the
autumn
many
years
of
observation
show
that
most
beaver
houses
do
receive
an
autumnal
plastering
and
the
few
that
do
not
have
this
attention
usually
have
thick
walls
and
do
not
need
it
one
autumn
in
montana
of
beaver
houses
which
i
examined
received
mud
covering
three
of
the
others
were
thickly
overgrown
with
willows
and
two
were
only
one
house
that
needed
reinforcement
did
not
receive
it
and
this
one
by
the
way
was
broken
into
by
a
bear
before
the
winter
had
got
fairly
under
way
illustration
an
unplastered
and
a
plastered
house
in
the
autumn
of
i
made
notes
concerning
eighteen
houses
these
i
watched
during
october
and
november
thirteen
were
plastered
a
one
and
a
one
both
of
which
had
thick
walls
were
not
plastered
the
remaining
three
were
not
greatly
in
need
of
additional
thickness
so
received
only
a
scanty
covering
of
sticks
two
of
these
were
broken
into
by
some
animal
during
the
winter
while
none
of
the
others
were
disturbed
beaver
frequently
show
good
judgment
in
that
important
matter
of
selecting
a
site
for
the
house
ice
and
sediment
are
two
factors
with
which
the
beaver
must
constantly
contend
in
the
pond
the
house
is
commonly
placed
in
deep
water
and
apparently
where
the
depth
around
it
will
not
be
rapidly
reduced
by
the
depositing
of
sediment
keeping
the
the
basin
and
the
canals
from
filling
with
sediment
is
one
of
the
difficult
problems
of
beaver
life
to
guard
against
the
rapid
encroachments
of
the
deposits
of
sediment
one
group
of
beaver
apparently
with
forethought
built
a
dam
that
formed
a
pond
from
the
waters
of
a
small
spring
which
carried
but
little
or
no
sediment
i
have
noticed
a
number
of
instances
in
which
a
pond
was
made
on
a
small
streamlet
with
greater
labor
than
it
would
have
required
to
form
a
pond
in
a
brook
as
there
were
a
number
of
other
conditions
favorable
to
the
brook
situation
of
the
house
the
only
conclusion
i
could
reach
was
that
these
selections
for
were
made
with
the
intention
of
avoiding
the
sediment
for
in
some
beaver
ponds
this
sediment
is
deposited
annually
to
the
depth
of
several
inches
ice
is
one
of
the
troubles
of
beaver
existence
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
beaver
that
he
should
have
his
house
so
situated
that
the
ice
of
winter
does
not
close
the
entrance
to
it
and
also
that
the
deep
water
in
which
his
pile
of
green
provisions
is
deposited
does
not
freeze
solid
and
thus
exclude
him
from
the
the
ice
fills
the
pond
from
the
top
and
compels
him
to
be
constantly
vigilant
to
save
himself
from
its
encroachments
many
a
beaver
home
has
been
built
alongside
a
spring
around
which
the
beaver
dredged
a
deep
hole
and
in
this
deposited
the
winter
the
constant
flow
of
the
spring
water
prevented
thick
ice
from
forming
both
around
the
and
between
it
and
the
large
numbers
of
beaver
do
not
possess
a
house
beaver
who
live
without
a
dam
or
pond
commonly
do
not
build
a
house
but
are
content
with
a
burrow
or
a
number
of
burrows
in
the
banks
of
the
waters
which
they
inhabit
in
the
severe
struggle
to
live
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
beaver
to
avoid
the
building
of
dams
and
houses
as
these
reveal
their
presence
and
put
the
aggressive
trapper
on
their
trail
many
colonies
have
both
houses
and
burrows
apparently
the
houses
were
used
in
the
the
burrows
in
summer
one
beaver
burrow
which
i
examined
was
about
one
foot
above
the
level
of
the
pond
and
twelve
feet
distant
from
it
the
entrance
tunnels
were
sixteen
feet
in
length
and
began
a
trifle
more
than
three
feet
under
water
near
the
edge
of
the
pond
this
burrow
measured
five
and
a
half
feet
long
about
half
as
wide
and
seventeen
inches
high
it
was
immediately
beneath
the
outspreading
roots
of
an
engelmann
spruce
the
majority
of
beaver
burrows
are
about
two
thirds
the
size
of
this
one
one
november
i
examined
more
than
a
score
of
beaver
colonies
there
was
no
snow
but
recent
cold
had
covered
the
pond
with
ice
and
solidified
the
miry
surroundings
over
the
frozen
surface
i
moved
easily
about
and
made
many
measurements
one
of
these
colonies
was
a
fairly
typical
one
the
colony
was
on
a
stream
that
came
down
from
the
snowy
heights
three
miles
distant
the
top
of
peak
and
mt
meeker
looked
down
upon
the
scene
the
altitude
of
this
colony
was
about
nine
thousand
feet
the
ponds
were
in
part
surrounded
by
willow
flats
with
here
and
there
a
high
point
or
a
stretch
of
bank
that
was
covered
with
aspens
the
tops
of
a
few
huge
boulders
thrust
up
through
the
water
all
around
stood
guard
a
tall
dark
forest
of
pines
these
swept
up
the
mountainside
where
they
were
displaced
by
a
growth
of
engelmann
spruce
which
reached
up
to
on
the
heights
above
this
colony
had
a
number
of
ponds
with
a
few
short
canals
extending
outward
from
them
a
conical
house
of
mud
and
slender
poles
stood
in
the
larger
pond
above
this
pond
there
were
half
a
dozen
pondlets
the
uppermost
of
which
was
formed
across
the
brook
by
a
dam
over
the
outward
ends
of
this
dam
the
water
flowed
and
was
caught
in
other
ponds
these
in
turn
overflowed
the
water
traversing
two
other
ponds
one
below
the
other
just
above
the
main
one
below
the
large
pond
were
three
smaller
ones
in
close
succession
the
dam
of
each
pond
backed
the
water
against
the
dam
above
it
the
dam
of
the
main
pond
was
two
hundred
and
thirty
feet
long
each
end
bent
upward
at
a
sharp
angle
and
extended
a
number
of
yards
upstream
this
dam
measured
five
feet
at
its
highest
point
but
along
the
greater
portion
was
only
a
trifle
more
than
three
feet
high
the
central
part
was
overgrown
with
sedge
and
willows
and
appeared
old
but
the
extreme
ends
appeared
new
and
probably
had
been
in
part
constructed
within
a
few
weeks
the
whole
dam
was
formed
of
earth
and
slender
poles
the
pond
formed
by
it
was
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
wide
and
had
an
average
length
up
and
down
stream
of
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
the
average
depth
was
only
two
feet
near
the
centre
of
this
large
pond
stood
the
house
a
trifle
nearer
to
the
dam
than
to
the
upper
edge
of
the
pond
i
measured
it
on
the
or
rather
the
it
took
feet
of
rope
to
go
around
it
the
top
of
the
house
rose
exactly
five
feet
above
the
ice
the
house
was
built
of
a
mixture
of
sods
and
willow
sticks
the
ends
of
the
sticks
here
and
there
thrust
out
through
the
covering
of
mud
which
the
house
had
recently
received
wondering
how
much
of
the
house
was
in
the
water
below
the
level
of
the
ice
i
thought
to
measure
the
depth
by
thrusting
a
pole
through
the
ice
to
the
bottom
holding
it
in
an
upright
position
i
raised
it
and
brought
it
down
with
all
my
strength
the
pole
went
through
the
ice
and
so
did
i
the
water
was
three
feet
deep
this
depth
covered
only
a
small
area
around
the
house
and
was
maintained
by
frequent
digging
the
house
is
often
plastered
with
this
dredged
material
altogether
then
the
house
from
its
lowest
foundation
on
the
bottom
of
the
pond
to
the
conical
top
was
eight
feet
high
the
foundation
of
this
house
was
made
of
turf
masses
of
grass
roots
and
a
small

reinforced
with
numerous
willow
sticks
the
floor
was
mostly

the
entrance
tunnels
were
filled
with
water
to
a
point
about
three
inches
below

as
these
were
the
only
entrances
or
openings
into
the

friend
or

could
enter
only
by
coming

through

or
the

of

the
single
circular
room
of
this
house
was
four
and
a
half
feet
in
diameter
and
about
two
feet
in
height
its
ceiling
was
roughly
formed
by
a
confused
interlacing
of
sticks
which
stood
at
an
angle
the
spaces
between
were
filled
with
mud
the
walls
were
a
trifle
more
than
two
feet
thick
except
around

conical

was
a
small
space
mostly
of
interlacing
sticks
the
thickness
of
which
was

one
foot

little

been
used
in

tiny

i
approached
there
could
be
seen
arising
from
these
holes
the
steamy
and
scented
breath
of
the
beaver
inhabitants
within
since
the
ventilation
of
beaver
houses
is
exceedingly
poor
and
as
this
animal
probably
does
not
suffer
from
tuberculosis
it
is
possible
that
ventilation
is
assisted
and
some
of
the
impure
air
absorbed
by
the
water
which
rises
almost
to
the

early
trappers
from

to
time
noted
extended
general
movements
or
emigrations
among
beaver
which
embraced
an
enormous
area
they
as
with
human
emigrants
probably
were
seeking
a
safer
better
home
some
of
these
movements
were
upstream
others
down
commonly
away
from
civilization
but
occasionally
toward
it
for
this
the
missouri
river
was
the
great
highway
limited
emigrations
of
this
kind
still
occasionally
occur
the
annual
migration
is
a
different
affair
this
has
been
noted
for
some
hundred
and
fifty
years
or
more
and
probably
has
gone
on
for
centuries
this
peculiar
migration
might
be
called
a
migratory
outing
in
it
all
members
of
the
colony
appear
to
have
taken
part
leaving
home
in
june
scattering
as
the
season
advanced
rambles
were
made
up
and
down
stream
other
beaver
settlements
visited
brief
stays
made
at
lakes
adventures
had
up
shallow
brooks
and
daring
journeys
made
on
portages
the
country
was
explored
the
dangers
and
restrictions
imposed
during
the
last
years
appear
in
some
localities
to
have
checked
this
movement
and
in
others
to
have
stopped
it
completely
but
in
most
colonies
it
still
goes
on
though
probably
not
usually
enjoyed
by
mothers
and
children
except
to
a
limited
extent
by
the
first
of
september
all
have
returned
to
the
home
or
joined
another
colony
or
assembled
at
the
place
where
a
new
colony
is
to
be
founded
this
annual
vacation
probably
sustained
the
health
of
the
colonists
they
got
away
from
the
parasites
and
the
bad
air
of
their
houses
the
outing
was
taken
for
the
sheer
joy
of
it
incidentally
it
brought
beaver
into
new
territory
and
acquainted
them
with
desirable
and
the
route
thereto
useful
information
in
case
the
colonists
were
compelled
suddenly
to
abandon
the
old
home
it
is
natural
for
the
beaver
to
be
silent
in
silence
he
becomes
intimate
with
the
elements
and
while
listening
hears
and
understands
all
moods
and
movements
that
concern
him
he
is
a
master
in
translating
sound
it
wakens
or
warns
threatens
or
gladdens
and
woos
him
back
to
slumberland
on
the
wild
frontier
in
his
fortress
island
home
in
safety
he
sits
and
sleeps
in
darkness
he
can
not
see
outside
but
the
conditions
of
the
surrounding
outer
world
are
revealed
to
him
by
continuous
and
varying
sounds
that
penetrate
the
thick
windowless
walls
of
his
house
he
hears
the
cries
of
the
coyote
and
the
cougar
the
call
of
moose
the
wild
and
fleeting
laugh
of
the
kingfisher
the
elemental
melody
of
the
ouzel
and
many
an
echo
faintly
from
afar
he
hears
the
soft
vibrations
from
the
muffled
feet
of
enemies
and
above
his
head
the
raking
threat
of
claws
upon
the
top
of
his
house
endlessly
the
water
slides
and
gently
pours
over
the
dam
and
softly
ebbs
around
the
pond
primeval
shores
the
earthquake
thunder
warns
of
storm
the
floods
roar
then
through
day
and
night
the
cleared
and
calmed
stream
goes
by
the
wind
booms
among
the
baffling
pines
and
the
broken
and
leafless
tree
falls
with
a
crash
there
is
silence
along
the
stream
open
way
through
the
woods
numberless
breezes
whisper
and
pause
by
the
primitive
house
in
the
water
the
beaver
engineering
realizing
that
the
supply
of
aspens
near
the
waters
of
the
moraine
colony
close
to
my
home
was
almost
exhausted
i
wondered
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
the
beavers
to
procure
a
sufficient
supply
downstream
or
whether
they
would
deem
it
best
to
abandon
this
old
colony
and
migrate
out
on
the
plains
where
cottonwoods
were
scarce
the
beavers
first
cut
those
close
to
the
colony
then
harvested
those
upstream
sometimes
going
a
mile
for
them
then
those
downstream
but
rarely
were
the
latter
brought
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
if
enemies
did
not
keep
down
the
population
of
a
colony
so
situated
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
until
the
scarcity
of
the
compelled
the
colonists
to
move
either
up
or
down
stream
and
start
anew
in
a
place
where
food
trees
could
be
obtained
but
not
a
move
until
necessity
drove
them
not
far
from
my
home
in
the
mountains
the
inhabitants
of
two
old
beaver
colonies
endured
hardships
in
order
to
remain
in
the
old
place
one
colony
in
order
to
reach
a
grove
of
aspens
dug
a
canal
three
hundred
and
feet
long
which
had
an
average
depth
of
fifteen
inches
and
a
width
of
inches
it
ended
in
a
grove
of
aspens
which
were
in
due
time
cut
down
and
floated
through
this
canal
into
the
pond
alongside
the
beaver
house
the
other
colony
endured
dangers
and
greater
hardships
during
the
summer
of
an
extensive
forest
fire
on
the
northerly
slope
of
long
peak
wrought
great
hardship
among
beaver
colonies
along
the
streams
in
the
fire
district
this
fire
destroyed
all
the
aspens
and
some
of
the
willows
in
order
to
have
food
while
a
new
growth
of
aspens
was
developing
the
beavers
at
a
colony
on
the
bierstadt
moraine
were
compelled
to
bring
their
winter
supply
of
aspens
the
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
an
isolated
grove
that
had
escaped
the
fire
this
stood
on
a
bench
of
the
moraine
at
an
altitude
about
fifty
feet
greater
than
that
of
the
beaver
pond
aspens
from
the
grove
were
dragged
about
two
hundred
feet
then
floated
across
a
small
and
from
this
taken
up
the
steep
slope
of
a
ridge
then
down
to
a
point
about
one
hundred
feet
from
the
pond
between
this
place
and
the
pond
was
a
deep
wreckage
of
and
fallen
spruces
to
cut
an
avenue
through
these
was
too
great
a
task
for
the
beavers
so
with
much
labor
they
dug
a
canal
beneath
the
wide
heap
of
wreckage
and
through
this
beneath
the
gigantic
fallen
trees
the
harvested
aspens
were
dragged
and
piled
in
the
pond
for
winter
food
the
gathering
of
these
harvests
even
by
beavers
must
have
been
almost
a
hopeless
task
in
going
thus
far
from
water
many
of
the
harvesters
were
exposed
to
their
enemies
and
it
is
probable
that
many
beavers
lost
their
lives
illustration
the
canal
beavers
become
strongly
attached
to
localities
and
especially
to
their
homes
it
is
difficult
to
drive
them
away
from
these
but
the
exhaustion
of
the
sometimes
compels
an
entire
colony
to
abandon
the
old
migrate
and
found
a
new
colony
some
of
the
beavers
most
audacious
engineering
works
are
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
of
the
colony
it
occasionally
happens
that
the
food
trees
near
the
water
by
an
old
colony
become
scarce
through
excessive
cutting
fires
or
tree
diseases
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
colonists
must
go
a
long
distance
for
their
supplies
or
move
they
prefer
to
stay
at
the
old
place
and
will
work
for
weeks
and
brave
dangers
to
be
able
to
do
this
they
will
build
a
dam
dig
a
new
canal
clear
a
difficult
to
a
grove
of
food
saplings
and
then
drag
the
harvest
a
long
distance
to
the
water
and
now
and
then
do
all
these
for
just
one
more
harvest
one
more
year
in
the
old
home
the
moraine
colony
had
lost
its
former
greatness
instead
of
the
several
ponds
and
the
eight
houses
of
which
it
had
consisted
twenty
years
before
only
one
house
and
a
single
pond
remained
the
house
was
in
the
deep
water
of
the
pond
about
twenty
feet
above
the
dam
a
vigorous
brook
from
chasm
lake
three
thousand
feet
above
ran
through
the
pond
and
poured
over
the
dam
near
the
house
the
colony
was
on
a
delta
tongue
of
a
moraine
here
it
had
been
established
for
generations
it
was
embowered
in
a
young
pine
forest
and
had
ragged
areas
of
willows
around
it
a
fire
and
excessive
cutting
by
beavers
had
left
but
few
aspens
near
the
water
these
could
furnish
food
for
no
more
than
two
autumn
harvests
and
perhaps
for
only
one
other
colonies
had
met
similar
conditions
how
would
the
moraine
colony
handle
theirs
the
moraine
colonists
mastered
the
situation
in
their
place
with
the
most
audacious
piece
of
work
i
have
ever
known
beavers
to
plan
and
accomplish
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
feet
south
of
the
old
pond
was
a
grove
of
aspens
between
these
and
the
pond
was
a
small
bouldery
flat
that
had
a
scattering
of
dead
and
standing
spruces
and
young
pines
a
number
of
fallen
spruces
lay
broken
among
the
partly
exposed
boulders
of
the
flat
one
day
i
was
astonished
to
find
that
a
dam
was
being
built
across
this
flat
and
still
more
astonished
to
discover
that
this
dam
was
being
made
of
heavy
sections
of
trees
under
necessity
only
will
beavers
gnaw
dead
wood
and
then
only
to
a
limited
extent
such
had
been
my
observations
for
years
but
here
they
were
cutting
dead
logs
in
a
wholesale
manner
why
were
they
cutting
this
dead
wood
and
why
a
dam
across
a
rocky
flat
a
place
across
which
water
never
flowed
a
dam
of
dead
timber
across
a
dry
flat
appeared
to
be
a
marked
combination
of
animal
stupidity
but
the
beavers
knew
what
they
were
doing
after
watching
their
activities
and
the
progress
of
the
dam
daily
for
a
month
i
realized
that
they
were
doing
development
work
with
the
intention
of
procuring
a
they
completed
a
dam
of
dead
timber
at
least
two
accidents
happened
to
the
builders
of
this
dam
one
of
these
occurred
when
a
tree
which
the
beavers
had
gnawed
off
pinned
the
beaver
that
had
cut
it
between
its
end
and
another
tree
immediately
behind
the
animal
the
other
accident
was
caused
by
a
tree
falling
in
an
unexpected
direction
this
tree
was
leaning
against
a
fallen
one
that
was
held
several
feet
above
the
earth
by
a
boulder
when
cut
off
instead
of
falling
directly
to
the
earth
it
slid
alongside
the
log
against
which
it
had
been
leaning
and
was
shunted
off
to
one
side
falling
upon
and
instantly
killing
two
of
the
logging
beavers
the
dam
when
completed
was
feet
long
it
was
about
fifty
feet
below
the
main
pond
and
sixty
feet
distant
from
the
south
side
of
it
fifty
feet
of
the
new
dam
ran
north
and
south
parallel
to
the
old
one
then
forming
a
right
angle
it
extended
feet
toward
the
east
it
averaged
three
feet
in
height
being
made
almost
entirely
of
large
chunks
cuttings
from
six
to
fifteen
inches
in
diameter
and
from
two
to
twelve
feet
long
it
appeared
a
crude
windrow
of
wreckage
illustration
moraine
colony
with
dam
the
day
it
was
completed
the
builders
shifted
the
scene
of
activity
to
the
brook
a
short
distance
below
the
point
where
it
emerged
from
the
main
pond
here
they
placed
a
small
dam
across
it
and
commenced
work
on
a
canal
through
which
they
endeavored
to
lead
a
part
of
the
waters
of
the
brook
into
the
reservoir
which
their
dam
had
formed
there
was
a
swell
or
slight
rise
in
the
earth
of
about
eighteen
inches
between
the
reservoir
and
the
head
of
the
canal
that
was
to
carry
water
into
it
the
swell
i
suppose
was
not
considered
by
the
beavers
at
any
rate
they
completed
about
half
the
length
of
the
canal
then
apparently
discovered
that
water
would
not
flow
through
it
in
the
direction
desired
other
have
made
similar
errors
the
beavers
were
almost
human
this
part
of
the
canal
was
abandoned
and
a
new
start
made
the
beavers
now
apparently
tried
to
overcome
the
swell
in
the
earth
by
an
artificial
work
a
pondlet
was
formed
immediately
below
the
old
pond
by
building
a
dam
the
ends
of
which
were
attached
to
the
old
dam
the
brook
pouring
from
the
old
pond
quickly
filled
this
new
narrow
reservoir
the
outlet
of
this
was
made
over
the
bow
dam
at
the
point
nearest
to
the
waiting
reservoir
of
the
dam
the
water
where
it
poured
over
the
outlet
of
the
bow
dam
failed
to
flow
toward
the
waiting
reservoir
but
was
shed
off
to
one
side
by
the
before
it
instead
of
flowing
southward
it
flowed
eastward
the
beavers
remedied
this
and
directed
the
flow
by
building
a
wing
dam
which
extended
southward
from
the
bow
dam
at
the
point
where
the
water
this
earthwork
was
about
fifteen
feet
long
four
feet
wide
and
two
high
along
the
upper
side
of
this
the
water
flowed
and
from
its
end
a
canal
was
dug
to
the
reservoir
about
half
of
the
brook
was
diverted
and
this
amount
of
water
covered
the
flat
and
formed
a
pond
to
the
height
of
the
dam
in
less
than
three
days
most
of
the
leaky
openings
in
this
dam
early
became
clogged
with
leaves
trash
and
sediment
that
were
carried
in
by
the
water
but
here
and
there
were
large
openings
which
the
beavers
mudded
themselves
the
new
pond
was
a
little
more
than
one
hundred
feet
long
and
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
wide
its
southerly
shore
flooded
into
the
edge
of
the
aspen
grove
which
the
beavers
were
planning
to
harvest
the
canal
was
from
four
to
five
feet
wide
and
from
eight
to
twenty
inches
deep
the
actual
distance
that
lay
between
the
brook
and
the
shore
of
the
new
pond
was
ninety
feet
though
the
diverting
of
the
water
was
a
task
it
required
less
labor
than
the
building
of
the
dam
with
dead
timber
and
the
canal
the
beavers
had
labored
two
seasons
for
the
purpose
of
getting
more
supplies
without
abandoning
the
colony
if
in
building
the
dam
they
had
used
the
green
easily
cut
aspens
they
would
have
greatly
reduced
the
available
it
would
have
required
most
of
these
aspens
to
build
the
dam
the
only
conclusion
i
can
reach
is
that
the
beavers
not
only
had
the
forethought
to
begin
work
to
obtain
a
that
would
be
needed
two
years
after
but
also
at
the
expense
of
much
labor
actually
saved
the
scanty
of
aspens
by
making
their
dam
with
the
hard
trees
a
large
harvest
of
aspen
and
willow
was
gathered
for
winter
daily
visits
to
the
scene
of
the
harvest
enabled
me
to
understand
many
of
the
methods
and
much
of
the
work
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
on
unknown
to
me
early
in
the
harvest
an
aspen
cluster
far
downstream
was
cut
every
tree
in
this
cluster
and
every
aspen
was
felled
dragged
to
the
brook
and
in
this
with
wrestling
pushing
and
pulling
taken
upstream
through
shallow
water
for
most
mountain
streams
are
low
during
the
autumn
in
the
midst
of
this
work
the
entrance
or
inlet
of
the
canal
was
blocked
and
the
bow
dam
was
cut
the
water
in
the
brook
was
almost
doubled
in
volume
by
the
closing
of
the
canal
thereby
making
the
transportation
of
aspens
upstream
less
laborious
illustration
the
dam
looking
south
when
the
downstream
aspens
at
last
reposed
in
a
pile
beside
the
house
harvesting
was
briskly
begun
in
the
aspens
along
the
shore
of
the
new
pond
then
came
another
surprise
the
bow
dam
was
repaired
and
the
canal
not
only
opened
but
enlarged
so
that
almost
all
the
water
in
the
brook
was
diverted
into
the
canal
through
which
it
flowed
into
the
new
pond
the
aspens
cut
on
the
shore
of
the
new
pond
were
floated
across
it
then
dragged
up
the
canal
into
the
old
pond
evidently
the
beavers
not
only
had
again
turned
the
water
into
the
canal
that
they
might
use
it
in
transportation
but
also
had
increased
the
original
volume
of
water
simply
to
make
this
transportation
of
the
aspens
as
easy
as
possible
their
new
works
enabled
the
colonists
to
procure
nearly
five
hundred
aspens
for
the
winter
all
these
were
taken
up
the
new
canal
dragged
over
the
bow
and
the
main
dams
and
piled
in
the
water
by
the
house
in
addition
to
these
the
aspens
brought
from
downstream
made
the
total
of
the
harvest
seven
hundred
and
trees
and
with
these
went
several
hundred
small
willows
altogether
these
made
a
large
green
that
measured
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
circumference
and
after
it
settled
averaged
four
feet
in
depth
this
was
the
for
the
oncoming
winter
the
upper
surface
of
this
stood
about
one
foot
above
the
surface
of
the
water
five
years
after
the
completion
of
this
dam
it
was
so
overgrown
with
willows
and
grass
that
the
original
material
the
dead
that
formed
the
major
portion
of
it
was
completely
covered
over
the
new
pond
was
used
but
one
season
all
the
aspens
that
were
made
available
by
the
dam
of
the
pond
were
cut
in
one
harvest
the
place
is
now
abandoned
old
ponds
and
new
the
ruined
colony
years
ago
while
studying
glaciation
on
the
slope
of
peak
i
came
upon
a
cluster
of
eight
beaver
houses
these
crude
conical
mud
huts
were
in
a
forest
pond
far
up
on
the
mountainside
in
this
colony
of
our
first
engineers
were
so
many
things
of
interest
that
the
fascinating
study
of
the
dead
ice
king
ruins
and
records
was
indefinitely
given
up
in
order
to
observe
citizen
beaver
works
and
ways
a
pile
of
granite
boulders
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
stood
several
feet
above
the
and
from
the
top
of
these
the
entire
colony
and
its
operations
could
be
seen
on
these
i
spent
days
observing
and
enjoying
the
autumnal
activities
of
beaverdom
it
was
the
busiest
time
of
the
year
for
these
industrious
folk
general
and
extensive
preparations
were
now
being
made
for
the
long
winter
amid
the
mountain
snows
a
harvest
of
scores
of
trees
was
being
gathered
and
work
on
a
new
house
was
in
progress
while
the
old
houses
were
receiving
repairs
it
was
a
serene
autumn
day
when
i
came
into
the
picturesque
village
of
these
primitive
people
the
aspens
were
golden
the
willows
rusty
the
grass
tanned
and
the
pines
were
purring
in
the
easy
air
the
was
in
a
small
basin
amid
morainal
débris
at
an
altitude
of
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
i
at
once
christened
it
the
moraine
colony
the
scene
was
utterly
wild
peaks
of
crags
and
snow
rose
steep
and
high
above
all
all
around
crowded
a
dense
evergreen
forest
of
pine
and
spruce
a
few
small
swamps
reposed
in
this
forest
while
here
and
there
in
it
bristled
several
gigantic
windrows
of
boulders
a
ragged
belt
of
aspens
surrounded
the
several
ponds
and
separated
the
pines
and
spruces
from
the
fringe
of
willows
along
the
shores
there
were
three
large
ponds
in
succession
and
below
these
a
number
of
smaller
ones
the
dams
that
formed
the
large
ponds
were
earthy
structures
about
four
feet
in
height
and
all
sagged
downstream
the
houses
were
grouped
in
the
middle
pond
the
largest
one
the
dam
of
which
was
more
than
three
hundred
feet
long
three
of
these
lake
dwellings
stood
near
the
upper
margin
close
to
where
the
brook
poured
in
the
other
five
were
clustered
by
the
outlet
just
below
which
a
small
island
lay
between
the
divided
waters
of
the
stream
a
number
of
beavers
were
busy
gnawing
down
aspens
while
others
cut
the
felled
ones
into
sections
pushed
and
rolled
the
sections
into
the
water
and
then
floated
them
to
the
harvest
piles
one
of
which
was
being
made
beside
each
house
some
were
quietly
at
work
spreading
a
coat
of
mud
on
the
outside
of
each
house
this
would
freeze
and
defy
the
tooth
and
claw
of
the
hungriest
or
the
strongest
predaceous
enemy
four
beavers
were
leisurely
lengthening
and
repairing
a
dam
a
few
worked
singly
but
most
of
them
were
in
groups
all
worked
quietly
and
with
apparent
deliberation
but
all
were
in
motion
so
that
it
was
a
busy
scene
to
work
like
a
beaver
what
a
stirring
exhibition
of
beaver
industry
and
forethought
i
viewed
from
my
at
times
upward
of
forty
of
them
were
in
sight
though
there
was
a
general
coöperation
yet
each
one
appeared
to
do
his
part
without
orders
or
direction
time
and
again
a
group
of
workers
completed
a
task
and
without
pause
silently
moved
off
and
began
another
everything
appeared
to
go
on
mechanically
it
produced
a
strange
feeling
to
see
so
many
workers
doing
so
many
kinds
of
work
effectively
and
automatically
again
and
again
i
listened
for
the
voice
constantly
i
watched
to
see
the
overseer
move
among
them
but
i
listened
and
watched
in
vain
yet
i
feel
that
some
of
the
patriarchal
fellows
must
have
carried
a
general
plan
of
the
work
and
that
during
its
progress
orders
and
directions
that
i
could
not
comprehend
were
given
from
time
to
time
the
work
was
at
its
height
a
little
before
nowadays
it
is
rare
for
a
beaver
to
work
in
daylight
men
and
guns
have
prevented
daylight
workers
from
leaving
descendants
these
not
only
worked
but
played
by
day
one
morning
for
more
than
an
hour
there
was
a
general
frolic
in
which
the
entire
population
appeared
to
take
part
they
raced
dived
crowded
in
general
whacked
the
water
with
their
tails
wrestled
and
dived
again
there
were
two
or
three
but
the
play
went
on
without
intermission
and
as
their
position
constantly
changed
the
merrymakers
splashed
water
all
over
the
main
pond
before
they
calmed
down
and
in
silence
returned
to
work
i
gave
most
attention
to
the
harvesters
who
felled
the
aspens
and
moved
them
bodily
or
in
sections
by
land
and
water
to
the
harvest
piles
one
tree
on
the
shore
of
the
pond
which
was
felled
into
the
water
was
eight
inches
in
diameter
and
fifteen
feet
high
without
having
even
a
limb
cut
off
it
was
floated
to
the
nearest
harvest
pile
another
about
the
same
size
which
was
procured
some
fifty
feet
from
the
water
was
cut
into
four
sections
and
its
branches
removed
then
a
single
beaver
would
take
a
branch
in
his
teeth
drag
it
to
the
water
and
swim
with
it
to
a
harvest
pile
but
four
beavers
united
to
transport
the
largest
section
to
the
water
they
pushed
with
fore
paws
with
breasts
and
with
hips
plainly
it
was
too
heavy
for
them
they
paused
now
they
will
go
for
help
i
said
to
myself
and
i
shall
find
out
who
the
boss
is
but
to
my
astonishment
one
of
them
began
to
gnaw
the
piece
in
two
and
two
more
began
to
clear
a
narrow
way
to
the
water
while
the
fourth
set
himself
to
cutting
down
another
aspen
good
roads
and
open
waterways
are
the
rule
and
perhaps
the
necessary
rule
of
beaver
colonies
i
became
deeply
interested
in
this
colony
which
was
situated
within
two
miles
of
my
cabin
and
its
nearness
enabled
me
to
be
a
frequent
visitor
and
to
follow
closely
its
fortunes
and
misfortunes
about
the
pond
i
lingered
when
it
was
covered
with
winter
white
when
fringed
with
the
gentian
blue
and
while
decked
with
the
yellow
glory
fire
ruined
it
during
an
autumn
of
drouth
one
morning
while
watching
from
the
i
noticed
an
occasional
flake
of
ash
dropping
into
the
pond
soon
smoke
scented
the
air
then
came
the
awful
and
subdued
roar
of
a
forest
fire
i
fled
and
from
above
the
watched
the
of
black
smoke
sweep
furiously
forward
bursting
and
closing
to
the
terrible
leaps
of
red
and
tattered
flames
before
noon
several
thousand
acres
of
forest
were
dead
all
leaves
and
twigs
were
in
ashes
all
blistered
and
blackened
the
moraine
colony
was
closely
embowered
in
a
pitchy
forest
for
a
time
the
houses
in
the
water
must
have
been
wrapped
in
flames
of
smelter
heat
could
these
mud
houses
stand
this
the
beavers
themselves
i
knew
would
escape
by
sinking
under
the
water
next
morning
i
went
through
the
hot
smoky
area
and
found
every
house
cracked
and
crumbling
not
one
was
inhabitable
most
serious
of
all
was
the
total
loss
of
the
uncut
when
harvesting
for
winter
had
only
begun
would
these
energetic
people
starve
at
home
or
would
they
try
to
find
refuge
in
some
other
colony
would
they
endeavor
to
find
a
grove
that
the
fire
had
missed
and
there
start
anew
the
intense
heat
had
consumed
almost
every
fibrous
thing
above
the
surface
the
piles
of
garnered
green
aspen
were
charred
to
the
all
that
remained
of
willow
thickets
and
aspen
groves
were
thousands
of
blackened
pickets
and
points
acres
of
coarse
charcoal
stubble
it
was
a
dreary
starving
outlook
for
my
furred
friends
i
left
the
scene
to
explore
the
entire
burned
area
after
wandering
for
hours
amid
ashes
and
charcoal
seeing
here
and
there
the
seared
carcass
of
a
deer
or
some
other
wild
animal
i
came
upon
a
beaver
colony
that
had
escaped
the
fire
it
was
in
the
midst
of
several
acres
of
swampy
ground
that
was
covered
with
willows
and
aspens
the
surrounding
pine
forest
was
not
dense
and
the
heat
it
produced
in
burning
did
no
damage
to
the
scattered
beaver
houses
from
the
top
of
a
granite
crag
i
surveyed
the
green
scene
of
life
and
the
surrounding
sweep
of
desolation
here
and
there
a
sodden
log
smouldered
in
the
ashen
distance
and
supported
a
tower
of
smoke
in
the
still
air
a
few
miles
to
the
east
among
the
scattered
trees
of
a
rocky
summit
the
fire
was
burning
itself
out
to
the
west
the
sun
was
sinking
behind
crags
and
snow
near
by
on
a
blackened
limb
a
robin
chattered
volubly
but
hopelessly
while
i
was
listening
thinking
and
watching
a
mountain
lion
appeared
and
leaped
lightly
upon
a
block
of
granite
he
was
on
my
right
about
one
hundred
feet
away
and
about
an
equal
distance
from
the
shore
of
the
nearest
pond
he
was
interested
in
the
approach
of
something
with
a
nervous
switching
of
his
tail
he
peered
eagerly
forward
over
the
crown
of
the
ridge
just
before
him
and
then
crouched
tensely
and
expectantly
upon
his
rock
a
pine
tree
that
had
escaped
the
fire
screened
the
place
toward
which
the
lion
looked
and
where
something
evidently
was
approaching
while
i
was
trying
to
discover
what
it
could
be
a
coyote
trotted
into
view
without
catching
sight
of
the
lion
he
suddenly
stopped
and
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
point
that
so
interested
the
crouching
beast
the
mystery
was
solved
when
thirty
or
forty
beavers
came
hurrying
into
view
they
had
come
from
the
ruined
moraine
colony
i
thought
to
myself
that
the
coyote
stuffed
as
he
must
be
with
the
seared
flesh
of
victims
would
not
attack
them
but
a
lion
wants
a
fresh
kill
for
every
meal
and
so
i
watched
the
movements
of
the
latter
he
adjusted
his
feet
a
trifle
and
made
ready
to
spring
the
beavers
were
getting
close
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
shout
to
frighten
him
the
coyote
leaped
among
them
and
began
killing
in
the
excitement
of
getting
off
the
crag
i
narrowly
escaped
breaking
my
neck
once
on
the
ground
i
ran
for
the
coyote
shouting
wildly
to
frighten
him
off
but
he
was
so
intent
upon
killing
that
a
violent
kick
in
the
ribs
first
made
him
aware
of
my
presence
in
anger
and
excitement
he
leaped
at
me
with
ugly
teeth
as
he
fled
the
lion
had
disappeared
and
by
this
time
the
beavers
in
the
front
ranks
were
jumping
into
the
pond
while
the
others
were
awkwardly
speeding
down
the
slope
the
coyote
had
killed
three
if
beavers
have
a
language
surely
that
night
the
refugees
related
to
their
hospitable
neighbors
some
thrilling
experiences
the
next
morning
i
returned
to
the
moraine
colony
over
the
route
followed
by
the
refugees
leaving
their
homes
they
had
followed
the
stream
that
issued
from
their
ponds
in
places
the
channel
was
so
clogged
with
fire
wreckage
that
they
had
followed
alongside
the
water
rather
than
in
it
as
is
their
wont
at
one
place
they
had
hurriedly
taken
refuge
in
the
stream
coyote
tracks
in
the
scattered
ashes
explained
this
but
after
going
a
short
distance
they
had
climbed
from
the
water
and
again
traveled
the
ashy
earth
beavers
commonly
follow
water
routes
but
in
times
of
emergency
or
in
moments
of
audacity
they
will
journey
overland
to
have
followed
this
stream
down
to
its
first
tributary
then
up
this
to
where
the
colony
in
which
they
found
refuge
was
situated
would
have
required
four
miles
of
travel
overland
it
was
less
than
a
mile
after
following
the
stream
for
some
distance
at
just
the
right
place
they
turned
off
left
the
stream
and
dared
the
overland
dangers
how
did
they
know
the
situation
of
the
colony
in
the
willows
or
that
it
had
escaped
fire
and
how
could
they
have
known
the
shortest
best
way
to
it
the
morning
after
the
arrival
of
the
refugees
work
was
begun
on
two
new
houses
and
a
dam
which
was
about
sixty
feet
in
length
and
built
across
a
grassy
open
green
cuttings
of
willow
aspen
and
alder
were
used
in
its
construction
not
a
single
stone
or
handful
of
mud
was
used
when
completed
it
appeared
like
a
windrow
of
freshly
raked
shrubs
it
was
almost
straight
but
sagged
a
trifle
downstream
though
the
water
filtered
freely
through
it
flooded
the
flat
above
as
the
two
new
houses
could
not
shelter
all
the
refugees
it
is
probable
that
some
of
them
were
sheltered
in
bank
tunnels
while
room
for
others
may
have
been
found
in
the
old
houses
that
winter
the
colony
was
raided
by
some
trappers
more
than
one
hundred
pelts
were
secured
and
the
colony
was
left
in
ruins
and
almost
depopulated
the
moraine
colony
site
was
deserted
for
a
long
time
eight
years
after
the
fire
i
returned
to
examine
it
the
willow
growth
about
the
ruins
was
almost
as
thrifty
as
when
the
fire
came
a
growth
of
aspen
taller
than
one
head
clung
to
the
old
while
a
close
seedling
growth
of
pine
throve
in
the
ashes
of
the
old
forest
one
low
mound
merry
with
blooming
columbine
was
the
only
house
ruin
to
be
seen
the
ponds
were
empty
and
every
dam
was
broken
the
stream
in
rushing
unobstructed
through
the
ruins
had
eroded
deeply
this
erosion
revealed
the
records
of
ages
and
showed
that
the
old
main
dam
had
been
built
on
the
top
of
an
older
dam
and
a
pond
the
second
dam
was
on
top
of
an
older
one
still
in
the
sediment
of
the
oldest
the
bottom
pond
i
found
a
spearhead
two
charred
logs
and
the
skull
of
a
buffalo
colonies
of
beaver
as
well
as
those
of
men
are
often
found
upon
sites
that
have
a
tragic
history
beavers
with
omar
might
say
when
you
and
i
behind
the
veil
are
past
oh
but
the
long
long
while
the
world
shall
last
the
next
summer
moraine
site
was
resettled
during
the
first
season
the
colonists
spent
their
time
repairing
dams
and
were
content
to
live
in
holes
in
autumn
they
gathered
no
harvest
and
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
after
the
snow
so
it
is
likely
that
they
had
returned
to
winter
in
the
colony
whence
they
had
come
but
early
in
the
next
spring
there
were
reinforced
numbers
of
them
at
work
establishing
a
permanent
settlement
three
dams
were
repaired
and
in
the
autumn
many
of
the
golden
leaves
that
fell
found
lodgment
in
the
fresh
plaster
of
two
new
houses
in
the
new
moraine
colony
one
of
the
houses
was
torn
to
pieces
by
some
animal
probably
a
bear
this
was
before
thanksgiving
about
a
prospector
left
his
tunnel
a
few
miles
away
came
to
the
colony
and
dynamited
a
house
and
got
seven
of
them
next
year
two
houses
were
built
on
the
ruins
of
the
two
just
fallen
that
was
broken
by
deadly
attacks
of
enemies
in
gathering
the
harvest
the
beavers
showed
a
preference
for
some
aspens
that
were
growing
in
a
moist
place
about
one
hundred
feet
from
the
water
whether
it
was
the
size
of
these
or
their
peculiar
flavor
that
determined
their
election
in
preference
to
nearer
ones
i
could
not
determine
one
day
while
several
beavers
were
cutting
here
they
were
surprised
by
a
mountain
lion
which
leaped
upon
and
killed
one
of
the
harvesters
the
next
day
the
lion
surprised
and
killed
another
two
or
three
days
later
a
coyote
killed
one
on
the
same
spot
and
then
overtook
and
killed
two
others
as
they
fled
for
the
water
i
could
not
see
these
deadly
attacks
from
the
but
in
each
case
the
sight
of
flying
beavers
sent
me
rushing
upon
the
scene
where
i
beheld
the
cause
of
their
desperate
retreat
but
despite
dangers
they
persisted
until
the
last
of
these
aspens
was
harvested
during
the
winter
the
bark
was
eaten
from
these
and
the
next
season
their
clean
wood
was
used
in
the
walls
of
a
new
house
one
autumn
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
some
immigrants
pass
me
for
a
new
home
in
the
moraine
colony
of
course
they
may
have
been
only
visitors
or
have
come
temporarily
to
assist
in
the
harvesting
but
i
like
to
think
of
them
as
immigrants
and
a
number
of
things
testified
that
immigrants
they
were
one
evening
i
had
been
lying
on
a
boulder
by
the
stream
below
the
colony
waiting
for
a
gift
from
the
gods
it
came
out
of
the
water
within
ten
feet
of
me
scrambled
the
most
patriarchal
as
well
as
the
largest
beaver
that
i
have
ever
seen
i
wanted
to
take
off
my
hat
to
him
i
wanted
to
ask
him
to
tell
me
the
story
of
his
life
but
from
long
habit
i
simply
lay
still
and
watched
and
thought
in
silence
he
was
making
a
portage
round
a
cascade
as
he
scrambled
up
over
the
rocks
i
noticed
that
he
had
but
two
fingers
on
his
right
hand
he
was
followed
in
single
file
by
four
others
one
of
these
was
minus
a
finger
on
the
left
hand
the
next
morning
i
read
that
five
immigrants
had
arrived
in
the
moraine
colony
they
had
registered
their
footprints
in
the
muddy
margin
of
the
lower
pond
had
an
agent
been
sent
to
invite
these
colonists
or
had
they
come
out
of
their
own
adventurous
spirit
the
day
following
their
arrival
i
trailed
them
backward
in
the
hope
of
learning
whence
they
came
and
why
they
had
moved
they
had
traveled
in
the
water
most
of
the
time
but
in
places
they
had
come
out
on
the
bank
to
go
round
a
waterfall
or
to
avoid
an
obstruction
here
and
there
i
saw
their
tracks
in
the
mud
and
traced
them
to
a
beaver
settlement
in
which
the
houses
and
dams
had
been
recently
wrecked
a
rancher
told
me
that
he
had
been
making
it
hot
for
all
beavers
in
his
meadow
during
the
next
two
years
i
occasionally
saw
this
patriarchal
beaver
or
his
tracks
thereabout
it
is
the
custom
among
old
male
beavers
to
idle
away
two
or
three
months
of
each
summer
in
exploring
the
neighboring
brooks
and
streams
but
they
never
fail
to
return
in
time
for
autumn
activities
it
thus
becomes
plain
how
when
an
old
colony
needs
to
move
some
one
in
it
knows
where
to
go
and
the
route
to
follow
illustration
the
moraine
house
before
and
after
enlargement
the
moraine
colonists
gathered
an
unusually
large
harvest
during
the
autumn
of
seven
hundred
and
sapling
aspens
and
several
hundred
willows
were
massed
in
the
main
pond
by
the
largest
house
this
pile
which
was
mostly
below
the
was
three
feet
deep
and
one
hundred
and
feet
in
circumference
would
a
new
house
be
built
this
fall
this
unusually
large
harvest
plainly
told
that
either
children
or
immigrants
had
increased
the
population
of
the
colony
of
course
a
hard
winter
may
also
have
been
expected
no
they
were
not
to
build
a
new
house
but
the
old
house
by
the
harvest
pile
was
to
be
enlarged
one
day
just
as
the
evening
shadow
of
long
peak
had
covered
the
pond
i
peeped
over
a
log
on
top
of
the
dam
to
watch
the
work
the
house
was
only
forty
feet
distant
not
a
ripple
stirred
among
the
inverted
peaks
and
pines
in
the
clear
pond
a
lone
beaver
rose
quietly
in
the
scene
from
the
water
near
the
house
swimming
noiselessly
he
made
a
circuit
of
the
pond
then
for
a
time
and
without
any
apparent
purpose
he
swam
back
and
forth
over
a
short
straight
course
he
moved
leisurely
and
occasionally
made
a
shallow
quiet
dive
he
did
not
appear
to
be
watching
anything
in
particular
or
to
have
anything
special
on
his
mind
yet
his
eyes
may
have
been
scouting
for
enemies
and
his
mind
may
have
been
full
of
house
plans
finally
he
dived
deeply
and
the
next
i
saw
of
him
he
was
climbing
up
the
side
of
the
house
addition
with
a
pawful
of
mud
by
this
time
a
number
of
beavers
were
swimming
in
the
pond
after
the
manner
of
the
first
one
presently
all
began
to
work
the
addition
already
stood
more
than
two
feet
above
the
the
top
of
this
was
and
was
about
seven
feet
long
and
half
as
wide
it
was
made
mostly
of
mud
which
was
plentifully
reinforced
with
willow
cuttings
and
aspen
sticks
for
a
time
all
the
workers
busied
themselves
in
carrying
mud
and
roots
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
placing
these
on
the
slowly
rising
addition
eleven
were
working
at
one
time
by
and
by
three
swam
ashore
each
in
a
different
direction
and
each
a
few
seconds
apart
after
a
minute
or
two
they
returned
from
the
shore
each
carrying
or
trailing
a
long
willow
these
were
dragged
to
the
top
of
the
addition
laid
down
and
trampled
in
the
mud
meantime
the
kept
steadily
at
their
work
again
willows
were
brought
but
this
time
four
beavers
went
and
as
before
each
was
independent
of
the
others
i
did
not
see
how
this
work
could
go
on
without
some
one
bossing
the
thing
but
i
failed
to
detect
any
beaver
acting
as
overseer
while
there
was
general
coöperation
each
acted
independently
most
of
the
time
and
sometimes
was
apparently
oblivious
of
the
others
these
beavers
simply
worked
slowly
silently
and
steadily
and
they
were
still
working
away
methodically
and
with
dignified
deliberation
when
darkness
hid
them
beaver
pioneers
i
often
wish
that
an
old
beaver
neighbor
of
mine
would
write
the
story
of
his
life
most
of
the
time
for
eighteen
years
his
mud
hut
was
among
the
lilies
of
lily
lake
estes
park
colorado
he
lived
through
many
wilderness
dangers
escaped
the
strategy
of
trappers
and
survived
the
dangerous
changes
that
come
in
with
the
his
life
was
long
stirring
and
adventurous
if
in
the
first
chapter
of
his
he
could
record
some
of
the
strong
thrilling
experiences
which
his
ancestors
must
have
related
to
him
his
book
would
be
all
the
better
my
beaver
neighbor
was
a
pioneer
and
a
it
is
probable
that
he
was
born
in
a
beaver
house
on
wind
river
and
it
is
likely
that
he
spent
the
first
six
years
of
his
life
along
this
crag
and
aspen
bordered
mountain
stream
the
first
time
i
saw
him
he
was
leading
an
emigrant
party
out
of
this
stream
upper
course
he
and
his
party
settled
or
rather
resettled
lily
lake
was
the
name
i
gave
him
because
of
his
straight
back
in
most
beaver
the
shoulders
swell
plumply
above
the
back
line
after
the
outline
of
the
grizzly
bear
along
with
this
peculiarity
which
enabled
me
to
be
certain
of
his
presence
was
another
this
was
his
habit
of
gnawing
trees
off
close
to
the
earth
when
he
felled
them
the
finding
of
an
occasional
stump
assured
me
of
his
presence
during
the
periods
i
failed
to
see
him
the
first
beaver
settlement
in
the
lake
appears
to
have
been
made
in
the
early
seventies
long
before
was
born
by
a
pair
of
beaver
who
were
full
of
the
pioneer
spirit
these
settlers
apparently
were
the
sole
survivors
of
a
large
party
of
emigrants
who
tried
to
climb
the
rugged
mountains
to
the
lake
having
been
driven
from
their
homes
by
encroaching
human
settlers
after
a
long
tedious
journey
full
of
hardships
and
dangers
they
climbed
into
the
lake
that
was
to
them
for
years
a
real
promised
land
driven
from
willow
creek
they
set
off
upstream
in
search
of
a
new
home
probably
without
knowing
of
lily
lake
which
was
five
miles
distant
and
two
thousand
feet
up
a
steep
rocky
mountain
these
pilgrims
had
traveled
only
a
little
way
upstream
when
they
found
themselves
the
greater
portion
of
the
time
out
of
water
this
was
only
a
brook
at
its
best
and
in
most
places
it
was
such
a
shallow
tiny
streamlet
that
in
it
they
could
not
dive
beyond
the
reach
of
enemies
or
even
completely
cool
themselves
in
stretches
the
water
spread
thinly
over
a
grassy
flat
or
a
smooth
granite
slope
again
it
was
lost
in
the
gravel
or
murmuring
faintly
pursued
its
way
out
of
sight
beneath
piles
of
boulder
marbles
shaped
by
the
ice
king
much
of
the
time
they
were
compelled
to
travel
upon
land
exposed
to
their
enemies
in
which
they
could
escape
and
rest
were
long
distances
apart
this
plodding
perilous
journey
which
the
beaver
made
up
the
mountain
to
the
lake
would
be
easy
and
for
an
animal
with
the
physical
of
a
bear
or
a
wolf
but
with
the
beaver
it
is
not
surprising
that
only
two
of
the
emigrants
survived
this
supreme
trial
and
escaped
the
numerous
dangers
of
the
pilgrimage
lily
lake
is
a
shallow
rounded
lily
garden
that
reposes
in
a
glacier
meadow
at
an
altitude
of
nine
thousand
feet
its
golden
often
dance
among
reflected
snowy
peaks
while
over
it
the
granite
crags
of
lily
mountain
rise
several
hundred
feet
a
few
low
sedgy
grassy
acres
border
half
the
shore
while
along
the
remainder
are
crags
aspen
groves
and
scattered
pines
its
waters
come
from
springs
in
its
western
margin
and
overflow
across
a
low
grassy
bar
on
its
curving
eastern
shore
it
was
autumn
when
these
beaver
pioneers
came
to
lily
lake
primitive
and
poetic
border
the
large
green
leaves
of
the
rested
upon
the
water
while
from
the
long
green
stems
had
fallen
the
sculptured
petals
of
gold
the
willows
were
wearing
leaves
of
brown
and
bronze
and
the
yellow
tremulous
robes
of
the
aspens
glowed
in
the
golden
sunlight
these
pioneers
made
a
dugout
a
hole
in
the
bank
and
busily
gathered
winter
food
until
stopped
by
frost
and
snow
then
almost
they
dozed
away
the
windy
winter
days
while
the
lake
was
held
in
waveless
ice
beneath
the
drifting
snow
the
next
summer
a
house
was
built
in
the
lily
pads
near
the
shore
here
a
number
of
children
were
born
during
the
few
tranquil
years
that
followed
these
times
came
to
an
end
one
bright
midsummer
day
lord
dunraven
had
a
ditch
cut
in
the
outlet
rim
of
the
lake
with
the
intention
of
draining
it
that
his
fish
ponds
several
miles
below
in
his
estes
park
might
have
water
a
drouth
had
prevailed
for
several
months
and
a
new
must
be
had
or
the
fish
ponds
would
go
dry
the
water
poured
forth
through
the
ditch
and
the
days
of
the
colony
appeared
to
be
numbered
a
beaver
must
have
water
for
safety
and
for
the
ease
of
movement
of
himself
and
his
supplies
he
is
skillful
in
maintaining
a
dam
and
in
regulating
the
these
two
things
require
much
of
his
time
in
lily
lake
the
dam
and
the
water
question
had
been
so
nicely
controlled
by
nature
that
with
these
the
colonists
had
had
nothing
to
do
however
they
still
knew
how
to
build
dams
and
had
not
become
a
lost
art
the
morning
after
the
completion
of
the
drainage
ditch
a
man
was
sent
up
to
the
lake
to
find
out
why
the
water
was
not
coming
down
a
short
time
after
the
had
departed
the
lowering
water
had
aroused
the
beaver
who
had
promptly
placed
a
dam
in
the
mouth
of
the
ditch
the
man
removed
this
dam
and
went
down
to
report
the
beaver
speedily
replaced
it
thrice
did
the
man
return
and
destroy
their
dam
but
thrice
did
the
beaver
promptly
restore
it
the
used
in
obstructing
the
ditch
consisted
chiefly
of
the
peeled
sticks
from
which
the
beaver
had
eaten
the
bark
in
winter
along
with
these
were
mud
and
grass
the
fourth
time
that
the
ditch
guard
returned
he
threw
away
all
the
material
in
the
dam
and
then
set
some
steel
traps
in
the
water
by
the
mouth
of
the
ditch
the
first
two
beaver
who
came
to
reblockade
the
ditch
were
caught
in
these
traps
and
drowned
while
struggling
to
free
themselves
other
beaver
heroically
continued
the
work
that
these
had
begun
the
cutting
down
of
saplings
and
the
procuring
of
new
material
made
their
work
slow
very
slow
in
the
face
of
the
swiftly
escaping
water
when
the
ditch
was
at
last
obstructed
a
part
of
the
material
which
formed
this
new
dam
consisted
of
the
traps
and
the
dead
bodies
of
the
two
beaver
who
had
bravely
perished
while
trying
to
save
the
colony
illustration
house
in
lily
lake
the
ditch
guard
returned
with
a
rifle
and
came
to
stay
the
first
beaver
to
come
within
range
was
shot
the
guard
again
removed
the
dam
made
a
fire
about
twenty
feet
from
the
ditch
and
planned
to
spend
the
night
on
guard
rifle
in
hand
toward
morning
he
became
drowsy
sat
down
by
the
fire
heard
the
air
in
the
pines
at
his
back
watched
the
water
and
finally
fell
asleep
while
he
thus
slept
with
his
rifle
across
his
lap
the
beaver
placed
another
their
last
obstruction
before
the
outrushing
water
on
awakening
the
sleeper
tore
out
the
dam
and
stood
guard
over
the
ditch
all
that
afternoon
a
number
of
beaver
hovered
about
watching
for
an
opportunity
to
stop
the
water
again
their
opportunity
never
came
and
three
who
ventured
too
near
the
rifleman
gave
up
their
lives
reddening
the
clear
water
with
their
in
vain
the
lake
was
drained
and
the
colonists
abandoned
their
homes
one
night
a
few
days
after
the
final
attempt
to
blockade
the
ditch
an
unwilling
beaver
emigrant
party
climbed
silently
out
of
the
uncovered
entrance
of
their
house
and
made
their
way
quietly
slowly
beneath
the
stars
across
the
mountain
descending
thence
to
wind
river
where
they
founded
a
new
colony
winter
came
to
the
old
and
the
lily
roots
froze
and
died
the
beaver
houses
rapidly
crumbled
and
for
a
few
years
the
picturesque
ruins
of
the
beaver
settlement
like
many
a
settlement
abandoned
by
man
stood
pathetically
in
the
midst
of
wilderness
desolation
slowly
the
water
rose
to
its
old
level
in
the
lake
as
the
outlet
ditch
gradually
filled
with
swelling
turf
and
drifting
sticks
and
trash
then
the
lilies
came
back
with
rafts
of
green
and
boats
of
gold
to
enliven
this
lakelet
of
repose
one
autumn
morning
while
returning
to
my
cabin
after
a
night
near
the
stars
on
lily
mountain
i
paused
on
a
crag
to
watch
the
changing
morning
light
down
wind
river
cañon
while
thus
engaged
and
a
party
of
colonists
came
along
a
game
trail
within
a
few
yards
of
me
evidently
bound
for
the
lake
which
was
only
a
short
distance
away
i
silently
followed
them
this
was
my
introduction
to
on
the
shore
these
seven
adventurers
paused
for
a
moment
to
behold
the
scene
or
possibly
to
dream
of
empire
then
they
waddled
out
into
the
water
and
made
a
circuit
of
the
lake
probably
had
been
here
before
as
an
explorer
within
two
hours
after
their
arrival
these
colonists
began
building
for
a
permanent
settlement
it
was
late
to
begin
winter
preparation
the
clean
white
aspens
had
shed
their
golden
leaves
and
stood
waiting
to
welcome
the
snows
this
lateness
may
account
for
the
makeshift
of
a
hut
which
the
colonists
constructed
this
was
built
against
the
bank
with
only
one
edge
in
the
water
the
entrance
to
it
was
a
tunnel
that
ended
in
the
where
the
water
was
two
feet
deep
the
beaver
were
collecting
green
aspen
and
willow
cuttings
in
the
water
by
the
when
the
lake
froze
over
fortunately
for
the
colonists
with
their
scanty
supply
of
food
the
winter
was
a
short
one
and
by
the
first
of
april
they
were
able
to
dig
the
roots
of
water
plants
along
the
shallow
shore
where
the
ice
had
melted
one
settler
succumbed
during
the
winter
but
by
summer
the
others
had
commenced
work
on
a
permanent
house
which
was
completed
before
harvest
time
i
had
a
few
glimpses
of
the
and
occasionally
saw
one
evening
while
watching
the
harvesters
i
saw
three
new
workers
three
emigrants
from
somewhere
had
joined
the
colonists
a
total
of
fifteen
five
of
whom
were
youngsters
went
into
winter
quarters
a
large
comfortable
house
a
goodly
supply
of
food
and
a
location
off
the
track
of
trappers
the
cold
white
days
promised
only
peace
but
an
unpreventable
catastrophe
came
before
the
winter
was
half
over
one
night
a
high
wind
began
to
bombard
the
lake
with
heavy
blasts
the
force
of
these
intermittent
gales
suggested
that
the
wind
was
trying
to
dislodge
the
entire
ice
covering
of
the
lake
and
indeed
that
very
nearly
happened
before
the
crisis
came
i
went
to
the
lake
believing
it
to
be
the
best
place
to
witness
the
full
effects
of
this
most
enthusiastic
wind
across
the
ice
the
gale
boomed
roaring
in
the
restraining
forest
beyond
these
broken
rushes
set
the
ice
vibrating
and
the
water
rolling
and
swelling
beneath
during
one
of
these
blasts
the
swelling
water
burst
the
ice
explosively
upward
in
a
fractured
ridge
entirely
across
the
lake
in
the
next
few
minutes
the
entire
surface
broke
up
and
the
wind
began
to
drive
the
cakes
upon
the
windward
shore
a
large
flatboat
cake
was
swept
against
the
beaver
house
sheared
it
off
on
the
and
overturned
the
conelike
top
into
the
lake
the
beaver
took
refuge
in
the
tunnel
which
ran
beneath
the
this
proved
a
for
its
shore
end
above
the
was
clogged
with
ice
as
the
lake
had
swelled
and
surged
beneath
the
beating
of
the
wind
the
water
had
gushed
out
and
streamed
back
into
the
tunnel
again
and
again
until
ice
formed
in
and
closed
the
outer
entrance
against
this
ice
four
beaver
were
smothered
or
drowned
i
surmised
the
tragedy
but
was
helpless
to
prevent
it
meanwhile
the
others
doubled
back
and
took
refuge
upon
the
ruined
stump
of
their
home
from
a
clump
of
pines
i
watched
this
wild
drama
less
than
half
an
hour
after
the
house
was
wrecked
these
indomitable
animals
began
to
rebuild
it
lashed
by
icy
waves
beaten
by
the
wind
with
ice
these
people
strove
to
rebuild
their
home
mud
was
brought
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
piled
upon
the
shattered
foundation
this
mud
set
froze
almost
instantly
on
being
placed
they
worked
desperately
and
from
time
to
time
i
caught
sight
of
toward
evening
it
appeared
possible
that
the
house
might
be
restored
but
just
as
darkness
was
falling
a
roaring
gust
struck
the
lake
and
a
great
swell
threw
the
new
part
into
the
water
the
colonists
gave
up
the
hopeless
task
and
that
night
fled
down
the
mountain
two
were
killed
before
they
had
gone
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
trail
were
three
other
red
smears
upon
the
crusted
snow
each
told
of
a
death
and
a
feast
upon
the
wintry
mountainside
among
the
solemn
pines
with
five
others
finally
gained
the
wind
river
colony
from
which
he
had
led
his
emigrants
two
years
before
one
day
the
following
june
while
examining
the
lilies
in
the
lake
i
came
upon
a
low
freshly
cut
stump
had
returned
a
number
of
colonists
were
with
him
and
all
had
come
to
stay
all
sizable
aspen
that
were
within
a
few
yards
of
the
water
had
been
cut
away
but
at
the
southwest
corner
of
the
lake
about
sixty
feet
from
the
shore
was
an
aspen
thicket
and
his
fellow
workers
cut
a
canal
from
the
lake
through
a
low
sedgy
flat
into
this
aspen
thicket
the
canal
was
straight
about
fourteen
inches
deep
and
inches
wide
its
walls
were
smoothly
cut
and
most
of
the
excavated
material
was
piled
evenly
on
one
side
of
the
canal
and
about
eight
inches
from
it
it
had
an
angular
mechanical
appearance
and
suggested
the
work
not
of
a
beaver
but
of
man
and
that
of
a
very
careful
man
too
down
this
canal
the
colonists
floated
the
timbers
used
in
building
their
two
houses
on
the
completion
of
the
houses
the
returned
to
the
grove
and
procured
winter
supplies
in
most
cases
the
small
aspen
were
floated
to
the
pile
between
the
houses
with
an
adept
skill
without
severing
the
trunk
or
cutting
off
a
single
limb
the
colonists
had
a
few
years
of
ideal
beaver
life
one
summer
i
came
upon
and
a
few
other
beaver
by
the
brook
that
drains
the
lake
and
at
a
point
about
half
a
mile
below
its
outlet
it
was
along
this
brook
that
intrepid
ancestors
had
painfully
climbed
to
establish
the
first
settlement
in
the
lake
commonly
each
summer
several
beaver
descended
the
mountain
and
spent
a
few
weeks
of
vacation
along
wind
river
invariably
they
returned
before
the
end
of
august
and
autumn
usually
began
shortly
after
their
return
year
after
year
the
regularly
equipped
trappers
passed
the
lake
without
stopping
the
houses
did
not
show
distinctly
from
the
trail
and
the
trappers
did
not
know
that
there
were
beaver
in
this
place
but
this
peaceful
populous
lake
was
not
forever
to
remain
immune
from
the
wiles
of
man
and
one
day
it
was
planted
with
that
barbaric
cruel
the
steel
trap
a
cultured
consumptive
who
had
returned
temporarily
to
nature
was
boarding
at
a
ranch
house
several
miles
away
while
out
riding
he
discovered
the
colony
and
at
once
resolved
to
depopulate
it
the
beaver
ignored
his
array
of
traps
until
he
enlisted
the
services
of
an
old
trapper
whose
skill
sent
most
of
the
beaver
to
their
death
before
the
catkins
appeared
upon
the
aspens
escaped
the
ruinous
raid
of
the
trappers
was
followed
by
a
dry
season
and
during
the
drouth
a
rancher
down
the
mountain
came
up
prospecting
for
water
he
cut
a
ditch
in
the
outlet
ridge
of
the
lake
and
out
gushed
the
water
he
started
home
in
a
cheerful
mood
but
long
before
he
arrived
the
first
engineers
had
blocked
his
ditch
during
the
next
few
days
and
nights
the
rancher
made
many
trips
from
his
house
to
the
lake
and
when
he
was
not
in
the
ditch
swearing
and
opening
it
the
beaver
were
in
it
shutting
off
the
water
from
time
to
time
i
dropped
around
to
see
the
struggle
one
day
coming
upon
the
scene
while
the
beaver
were
completing
a
blockade
for
a
time
the
beaver
hesitated
then
they
partly
resumed
operations
and
carried
material
to
the
spot
but
without
showing
themselves
entirely
above
water
when
it
appeared
that
they
must
have
enough
to
complete
the
blockade
i
advanced
a
trifle
nearer
so
as
to
have
a
good
view
while
they
placed
the
accumulated
material
for
a
time
not
a
beaver
showed
himself
by
and
by
an
aged
one
climbed
out
of
the
water
pretending
not
to
notice
me
and
deliberately
piled
things
right
and
left
until
he
had
completed
the
to
his
satisfaction
this
act
was
audacious
and
truly
heroic
the
hero
was
in
this
contest
with
the
rancher
the
beaver
persisted
and
worked
so
effectively
that
they
at
last
won
and
saved
their
homes
in
the
face
of
what
appeared
to
be
an
unconquerable
opposition
a
little
while
after
this
incident
a
came
along
and
liking
the
place
built
a
cabin
in
a
clump
of
pines
close
to
the
southern
shore
though
he
was
a
gray
old
man
without
a
family
i
imagined
he
would
exterminate
the
beaver
and
looked
upon
him
with
a
lack
of
neighborly
feeling
several
months
went
by
and
i
had
failed
to
call
upon
him
but
one
day
while
passing
i
heard
him
order
a
trapper
off
the
place
this
order
was
accompanied
by
so
strong
a
declaration
of
principles
together
with
a
humane
plea
for
the
life
of
every
wild
animal
that
i
made
haste
to
call
that
evening
one
afternoon
in
a
pine
thicket
close
to
the
i
came
upon
two
gray
wolves
both
devouring
beaver
which
had
met
their
death
while
harvesting
aspens
for
winter
the
following
spring
i
had
a
more
delightful
glimpse
of
life
in
the
wilds
within
fifty
feet
of
the
stood
a
large
pine
stump
that
rose
about
ten
feet
from
the
ground
feeling
that
i
should
escape
notice
if
i
sat
still
on
the
top
i
climbed
up
though
it
was
the
beaver
came
out
of
the
lake
and
wandered
about
nibbling
here
and
there
at
the
few
green
plants
of
early
spring
they
did
not
detect
me
they
actually
appeared
to
enjoy
themselves
this
is
the
only
time
that
i
ever
saw
a
beaver
fully
at
ease
and
apparently
happy
on
land
in
the
midst
of
their
pleasures
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
came
along
and
mingled
with
them
the
beaver
paused
and
stared
now
and
then
a
sheep
would
momentarily
stare
at
a
beaver
or
sniff
the
air
as
though
he
did
not
quite
like
beaver
odor
in
less
than
a
minute
the
flock
moved
on
but
just
as
they
started
a
beaver
passed
in
front
of
the
lead
ram
who
made
a
playful
pretense
of
a
butt
at
him
to
this
the
beaver
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
during
the
homesteader
second
summer
he
concluded
to
raise
the
outlet
ridge
deepen
the
water
and
make
a
fish
pond
of
the
lake
being
poor
he
worked
alone
with
wheelbarrow
and
shovel
the
beaver
evidently
watched
the
progress
of
the
work
and
each
morning
their
fresh
footprints
showed
in
the
newly
piled
earth
shortly
before
the
dam
was
completed
the
homesteader
was
called
away
for
a
few
days
and
on
his
return
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
the
beaver
had
completed
his
dam
the
part
made
by
the
beaver
suited
him
as
to
height
and
length
so
he
covered
it
over
with
earth
and
allowed
it
to
remain
his
work
in
turn
was
inspected
and
apparently
approved
by
the
beaver
how
long
does
a
beaver
live
trappers
say
from
fifteen
to
fifty
years
i
had
glimpses
of
through
eighteen
years
and
he
must
have
been
not
less
than
four
years
of
age
when
i
first
met
him
this
would
make
his
age
years
but
he
may
have
been
six
years
of
age
he
looked
it
the
morning
he
first
led
emigrants
into
lily
lake
and
he
may
have
lived
a
few
years
after
i
saw
him
last
but
only
the
chosen
few
among
the
beaver
can
succeed
in
living
as
long
as
the
last
time
i
saw
him
was
the
day
he
dared
me
and
blockaded
the
drain
ditch
and
stopped
the
outrushing
water
has
vanished
and
the
kind
old
homesteader
has
gone
to
his
last
long
sleep
but
the
lake
still
remains
and
still
there
stands
a
beaver
house
among
the
the
colony
in
winter
in
the
medicine
bow
mountains
one
december
day
i
came
upon
a
beaver
house
that
was
surrounded
by
a
pack
of
wolves
these
beasts
were
trying
to
break
into
the
house
apparently
an
early
autumn
snow
had
blanketed
the
house
and
thus
prevented
its
walls
from
freezing
the
soft
condition
of
the
walls
along
with
the
extreme
hunger
of
the
wolves
led
to
this
assault
two
of
these
animals
were
near
the
top
of
the
house
clawing
away
at
a
rapid
rate
now
and
then
one
of
the
sticks
or
poles
in
the
was
encountered
and
at
this
the
wolf
would
bite
and
tear
furiously
occasionally
one
of
the
wolves
caught
a
resisting
stick
in
his
teeth
and
leaning
back
shook
his
head
endeavoring
with
all
his
might
to
tear
it
out
a
number
of
wolves
lay
about
expectant
a
few
sat
up
eagerly
on
haunches
while
others
moved
about
snarling
driving
the
others
off
a
few
yards
to
be
in
turn
driven
off
themselves
shortly
before
they
discovered
me
there
was
a
fierce
fight
on
top
of
the
house
in
which
several
mixed
even
though
they
had
broken
into
the
house
it
would
have
availed
them
nothing
for
in
this
as
in
all
old
colonies
there
were
safety
tunnels
from
the
house
which
extended
beneath
the
pond
to
points
on
shore
in
these
tunnels
the
beaver
find
safety
if
by
any
means
the
house
is
ruined
although
carnivorous
animals
are
fond
of
beaver
flesh
they
rarely
take
the
useless
trouble
of
digging
into
a
house
occasionally
a
wolverine
or
a
bear
may
dig
into
a
house
or
one
not
frozen
then
after
breaking
in
lie
in
wait
and
endeavor
to
make
a
capture
while
the
beaver
are
repairing
the
hole
beaver
are
more
secure
from
enemies
during
the
winter
than
at
any
other
time
it
is
while
felling
a
tree
far
from
the
water
or
while
following
a
shallow
stream
that
most
beaver
are
captured
by
their
enemies
many
a
time
in
winter
i
have
made
a
pleasant
visit
to
a
beaver
colony
one
day
a
few
hours
after
a
heavy
snowfall
i
came
out
of
a
dark
forest
and
stood
for
a
time
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
around
were
the
firs
and
spruces
of
the
forest
moveless
as
statues
and
each
a
pointed
cone
of
snow
around
the
small
snowy
plain
of
the
pond
the
drooping
willows
held
their
heads
together
in
contented
and
thoughtful
silence
everything
was
serene
illustration
house
pond
and
dam
in
winter
a
clean
fox
track
led
from
the
woods
in
a
straight
line
across
the
snowy
surface
of
the
pond
to
the
house
which
stood
near
the
centre
of
this
smooth
white
opening
the
tracks
encircled
the
house
and
ascended
to
the
top
of
it
where
the
record
imprinted
in
the
snow
told
that
here
he
watchfully
rested
descending
he
had
sniffed
at
the
bushy
tips
of
the
winter
that
thrust
up
through
the
ice
then
crossed
the
dam
to
plunge
into
the
snowy
tangle
of
willows
water
was
still
pouring
and
gurgling
down
a
steep
beaver
slide
this
was
except
at
two
points
where
the
swift
splashing
water
dashed
intermittently
from
a
deep
icy
vent
while
i
was
examining
the
beauty
of
the
upbuilding
icy
buttresses
by
one
of
the
vents
a
came
forth
and
alighted
almost
within
reach
i
stood
still
after
giving
a
few
of
his
nodding
bows
he
reëntered
the
vent
presently
he
emerged
from
the
lower
vent
and
alighting
upon
an
boulder
indifferent
to
the
gray
sky
from
which
scattered
flakes
were
slowly
falling

despite
a
temperature
of
five
below
zero
he
sang
low
and
sweetly
for
several
seconds
beaver
do
not
surrender
themselves
to
the
confines
of
a
house
and
pond
until
cold
solidly
covers
the
pond
with
a
roof
of
ice
the
time
of
this
is
commonly
about
the
first
of
december
but
the
date
is
of
course
in
a
measure
dependent
upon
latitude
altitude
and
the
peculiar
weather
conditions
of
each
year
most
beaver
return
to
the
old
colony
or
start
a
new
one
by
the
first
of
september
they
have
had
a
merry
rambling
summer
and
energetically
take
hold
to
have
the
house
and
dam
ready
and
a
harvest
stored
by
the
time
winter
begins
but
they
are
not
always
ready
enemies
may
harass
them
low
water
delay
them
or
an
unusually
early
winter
or
even
a
heavy
snow
may
so
hamper
them
that
despite
greatest
effort
the
ice
puts
a
time
lock
upon
the
pond
and
closes
them
in
for
the
winter
without
sufficient
supplies
early
one
october
an
early
snowfall
worked
hardship
in
several
colonies
near
my
home
fortunately
the
ponds
were
not
deeply
frozen
and
those
colonies
which
had
aspen
groves
close
to
the
water
succeeded
in
felling
and
dragging
in
sufficient
for
the
winter
as
snow
drifted
into
the
groves
many
of
the
trees
harvested
were
cut
from
the
tops
of
snowdrifts
and
thus
left
high
stumps
the
following
summer
a
number
of
these
stood
four
feet
above
the
earth
and
presented
a
striking
appearance
alongside
the
stumps
of
normal
height
one
of
these
colonies
fared
badly
the
inhabitants
were
obliged
to
go
a
long
distance
from
the
water
for
trees
and
their
all
too
scanty
harvest
was
gathered
with
some
loss
of
life
apparently
both
wolves
and
lions
discovered
the
unfortunate
predicament
of
the
harvesters
and
lay
in
wait
to
catch
them
as
they
floundered
slowly
through
the
snow
the
following
winter
these
colonists
tunneled
through
the
bottom
perhaps
the
least
frozen
part
of
the
dam
and
came
forth
for
food
long
before
the
of
the
ice
the
water
drained
from
the
pond
and
after
the
ice
had
melted
the
bottom
of
the
pond
revealed
a
condition
as
though
the
starving
winter
inmates
had
dug
out
for
food
every
root
and
rootstock
to
be
found
in
the
bottom
while
visiting
ponds
at
the
beginning
of
winter
i
have
many
times
noticed
that
shortly
after
the
pond
was
solidly
frozen
over
a
hole
was
made
through
the
dam
just
below
the
of
the
pond
this
lowered
the
two
inches
or
more
did
this
slight
lowering
of
the
water
have
to
do
with
the
ventilation
of
the
pond
or
was
it
to
put
a
check
on
deep
freezing
or
for
both
purposes
in
the
majority
of
cases
these
holes
were
made
from
ponds
which
during
the
winter
received
but
a
meagre
inflow
of
fresh
water
naturally
ponds
receiving
a
strong
inflow
of
water
would
be
better
ventilated
and
would
freeze
less
swiftly
and
deeply
than
those
whose
waters
became
stagnant
this
of
water
after
a
few
inches
of
ice
had
formed
would
in
some
places
despite
the
settling
of
the
ice
form
an
air
blanket
that
would
delay
freezing
and
thus
possibly
prevent
the
ice
from
forming
so
thickly
the
air
admitted
by
drawing
off
the
water
would
be
inclosed
beneath
the
ice
and
might
thus
be
helpful
to
the
beaver
inclosed
in
house
and
pond
in
only
a
few
cases
were
these
holes
made
from
ponds
which
had
subway
tunnels
tunnels
which
run
from
alongside
the
house
through
the
bottom
of
the
pond
to
a
point
above
on
the
shore
in
a
few
instances
the
beaver
i
do
not
know
how
many
came
out
of
this
hole
cut
and
ate
a
few
twigs
and
then
returned
and
closed
it
twice
this
was
used
as
a
way
out
by
beaver
who
emerged
and
went
to
other
colonies
in
one
case
the
beaver
entered
the
other
pond
by
making
a
hole
through
the
dam
in
the
other
they
entered
the
pond
through
a
subway
tunnel
while
these
holes
which
lower
the
may
have
chiefly
to
do
with
ventilation
or
may
be
for
the
purpose
of
putting
a
check
on
freezing
my
evidence
is
not
ample
enough
for
final
conclusions
a
sentence
of
close
confinement
for
about
a
third
of
the
year
for
an
animal
that
breathes
air
and
uses
pure
water
is
simply
one
of
the
strange
ways
that
work
out
with
nature
while
winter
lasts
a
beaver
must
spend
his
time
either
in
the
dark
house
or
in
the
water
of
the
pond
apparently
he
does
much
sleeping
and
possibly
has
a
dull
time
of
it
no
news
no
visitors
and
apparently
nothing
to
do
still
a
beaver
has
food
and
when
dangers
surround
the
wild
folk
outside
the
pond
roof
of
glass
he
would
be
considered
a
good
risk
for
life
insurance
although
the
pond
is
commonly
covered
with
snow
or
the
ice
curtained
with
air
bubbles
there
have
been
numerous
times
during
which
i
have
had
clear
views
into
the
water
and
could
see
and
enjoy
all
that
was
going
on
within
as
completely
as
though
looking
at
fish
or
turtles
through
the
glass
walls
of
an
aquarium
often
i
have
peered
through
the
ice
which
covered
the
most
used
place
of
a
winter
beaver
pond
the
area
between
the
and
the
the
thinness
of
the
ice
over
this
place
was
maintained
by
which
came
up
through
the
bottom
and
the
beaver
had
so
arranged
their
affairs
that
they
made
the
best
use
of
this
water
of
course
most
ponds
are
without
springs
many
a
time
i
have
seen
a
beaver
come
out
of
the
doorway
of
his
house
and
go
swimming
toward
the
with
his
hands
against
his
breast
at
the
pile
if
there
was
nothing
small
or
short
enough
he
set
to
work
and
gnawed
it
off
the
piece
secured
was
taken
into
the
doorway
either
in
his
hands
or
in
his
teeth
afterward
a
beaver
the
same
one
i
suppose
came
out
of
the
doorway
and
cast
the
clean
bone
of
the
stick
from
which
the
bark
had
been
eaten
into
the
bottom
of
the
pond
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
the
beaver
apparently
comes
into
the
pond
a
few
times
each
day
for
a
swim
in
the
midst
of
swimming
he
rises
at
times
to
the
under
surface
of
the
ice
and
with
his
nose
against
it
exhales
a
quantity
of
air
after
remaining
with
nose
at
this
point
a
few
seconds
the
action
of
the
air
bubbles
indicates
that
he
is
inhaling
the
purified
air
the
rootstocks
of
the
are
sometimes
dug
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
at
other
times
the
beaver
eats
the
stalks
of
plants
that
grow
in
the
water
or
digs
out
willow
or
other
roots
around
the
edge
of
the
pond
numbers
of
trout
frequently
lie
in
the
water
close
to
the
doorway
of
a
beaver
house
or
around
the
possibly
the
beaver
dispense
tidbits
of
food
that
are
liked
by
the
trout
occasionally
grubs
fall
from
the
holes
in
wood
from
which
beaver
have
eaten
the
bark
while
beaver
are
digging
in
the
bottom
of
the
pond
they
doubtless
unearth
that
are
welcome
to
trout
for
these
often
hover
in
numbers
on
the
outskirts
of
the
muddy
water
which
beaver
roil
while
digging
although
it
appears
that
beaver
have
dull
winters
with
but
little
to
do
but
eat
sleep
and
swim
it
is
probable
that
some
of
their
time
is
spent
at
work
a
part
of
their
tunneling
and
is
done
in
winter
i
have
known
of
their
extending
canals
in
the
bottom
of
the
pond
and
making
submarine
tunnels
while
the
pond
was
there
are
times
when
the
dam
has
sprung
a
leak
and
must
be
repaired
on
the
inside
beneath
the
ice
early
thaws
and
spring
freshets
sometimes
wreck
a
dam
beyond
repair
or
do
extensive
damage
to
the
house
or
dam
at
the
time
when
beaver
enemies
are
likely
to
be
at
their
leanest
the
house
and
dam
are
sometimes
ruined
when
the
streams
are
so
low
and
icy
that
it
is
not
safe
for
beaver
to
go
about
i
know
of
two
colonies
that
were
crushed
out
of
existence
by
the
dam
is
on
rare
occasions
broken
by
late
spring
sometimes
the
pile
up
on
the
dam
and
raise
the
water
in
the
pond
to
such
a
height
that
it
rises
in
the
house
and
drives
the
beaver
forth
a
few
beaver
houses
that
are
situated
in
places
where
the
ice
or
spring
floods
may
raise
the
water
much
above
normal
level
are
shaped
to
meet
this
trouble
the
house
is
built
higher
and
the
room
internally
is
twice
the
usual
height
thus
there
is
space
for
the
beaver
to
build
a
platform
bed
on
the
floor
and
thus
raise
themselves
a
foot
or
more
above
the
common
level
despite
all
pains
floods
sometimes
drive
beaver
to
the
housetops
by
laying
up
supplies
and
by
the
help
of
artificial
pond
canal
and
house
the
beaver
is
able
to
spend
his
winter
without
hunger
and
with
comfort
and
far
greater
safety
than
his
neighbors
the
winds
may
blow
and
blinding
snow
or
flying
limbs
may
endanger
those
outside
snow
may
bury
the
forage
of
bird
and
deer
and
make
the
movement
of
beasts
of
prey
slow
and
difficult
the
cold
may
freeze
and
freeze
and
strew
the
wilds
with
lean
and
frozen
forms
but
the
beaver
beneath
ice
and
snow
shelter
serenely
spends
the
days
with
comfort
and
safety
the
winter
with
its
days
long
or
short
never
comes
to
an
end
however
quite
early
enough
to
suit
the
beaver
they
emerge
from
the
pond
at
the
earliest
moment
that
frozen
conditions
will
allow
if
their
subway
is
choked
with
ice
and
food
becomes
exhausted
they
will
sometimes
bore
holes
through
the
base
of
the
dam
apparently
too
holes
of
this
kind
are
bored
through
or
a
section
cut
through
the
dam
to
the
bottom
for
the
purpose
of
completely
draining
the
pond
as
this
appears
to
be
most
often
done
with
ponds
that
are
full
of
stagnant
water
or
water
almost
stagnant
this
draining
may
be
a
part
of
the
beaver
sanitary
work
done
for
the
purpose
of
getting
filth
and
stale
water
out
and
also
that
the
sour
bottom
may
be
sterilized
by
sun
and
wind
conditions
determine
the
length
of
time
before
the
dam
is
repaired
and
the
pond
refilled
in
some
cases
this
is
done
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
weeks
and
in
others
not
until
autumn
ponds
that
have
large
pure
streams
running
through
them
do
not
need
this
emptying
but
occasionally
they
accidentally
have
it
most
beaver
colonies
are
deserted
in
summer
and
fall
thus
into
temporary
decline
by
late
summer
or
early
autumn
the
beaver
have
assembled
at
the
place
where
the
winter
is
to
be
spent
there
are
patriarchs
youngsters
and
those
in
the
prime
of
life
around
the
old
home
are
many
who
set
forth
from
it
when
the
violets
were
blooming
when
the
grass
was
at
its
greenest
and
when
mated
birds
were
building
during
the
summer
a
few
perished
while
others
cast
their
lot
with
other
established
colonies
a
few
of
the
younger
make
a
start
for
themselves
in
new
scenes
found
a
new
colony
again
the
dam
is
repaired
and
the
house
recovered
again
the
harvest
home
and
again
a
primitive
family
are
housed
in
a
hut
that
willing
hands
have
fashioned
again
the
pond
freezes
and
again
the
snow
falls
upon
a
home
that
stands
in
a
valley
where
countless
generations
of
beaver
have
lived
through
winters
and
the
happy
seasons
the
original
conservationist
to
work
like
a
beaver
is
an
almost
universal
expression
for
energetic
and
intelligent
persistence
but
who
realizes
the
magnitude
of
the
beaver
works
what
he
has
accomplished
is
not
only
monumental
but
useful
to
man
he
was
the
original
conservationist
an
interesting
and
valuable
book
could
be
written
concerning
the
earth
as
influenced
and
benefited
by
the
labors
of
the
beaver
the
beaver
is
intimately
associated
with
the
natural
resources
soil
and
water
his
work
is
not
yet
done
and
along
the
sources
of
innumerable
streams
he
will
ever
be
needed
to
save
soil
to
regulate
and
to
provide
pools
for
the
fish
the
beaver
conservation
work
is
accomplished
by
means
of
the
dams
he
constructs
across
streams
of
flowing
water
and
the
ponds
that
are
thus
formed
these
dams
and
ponds
render
a
number
of
services
first
they
save
soil
second
they
check
erosion
third
they
reduce
flood
damage
fourth
they
store
water
and
help
to
sustain
fifth
they
provide
for
fish
and
sixth
they
are
helpful
in
maintaining
deep
waterways
by
reducing
the
extremes
of
both
high
and
low
water
and
also
by
reducing
the
quantity
of
sediment
carried
down
into
i
had
enjoyed
the
ways
of
our
first
engineers
before
it
dawned
upon
me
that
their
works
might
be
useful
to
man
and
that
the
beaver
through
his
constructive
handling
of
the
natural
resources
might
justly
be
called
a
conservationist
one
dry
winter
the
stream
through
the
moraine
colony
ran
low
and
froze
to
the
bottom
and
the
only
trout
in
it
that
survived
were
those
in
the
deep
holes
of
beaver
ponds
these
ponds
offer
many
advantages
to
fish
multiplication
much
food
acceptable
to
the
fish
is
swept
into
these
ponds
altogether
a
beaver
pond
is
an
excellent
local
habitation
for
fish
one
gray
day
while
i
was
examining
a
beaver
colony
there
came
another
demonstration
of
the
usefulness
of
beaver
ponds
the
easy
rain
of
two
days
ended
in
a
heavy
downpour
a
deluge
upon
the
mountainside
a
mile
or
so
upstream
there
was
almost
nothing
on
this
mountain
either
to
absorb
or
delay
the
excess
of
water
which
was
speedily
shed
into
the
stream
below
flooding
down
the
stream
channel
above
the
beaver
pond
came
a
roaring
avalanche
of
water
or
with
a
front
that
was
five
or
six
feet
high
this
expanded
as
it
rolled
into
the
pond
and
swept
far
out
on
the
sides
while
the
greatly
lowered
rushed
over
the
dam
a
half
a
dozen
ponds
immediately
below
sufficed
so
to
check
the
speed
of
this
water
and
so
greatly
to
reduce
its
volume
that
as
it
poured
over
the
last
dam
of
this
colony
it
was
no
longer
a
flood
the
regulation
of
is
important
there
are
only
a
few
rainy
days
each
year
and
all
the
water
that
flows
to
the
sea
through
falls
during
these
few
rainy
days
the
instant
the
water
reaches
the
earth
it
is
hurried
away
by
gravity
and
unless
there
are
factors
to
delay
this
the
rivers
would
naturally
contain
water
only
on
the
rainy
days
and
for
a
little
while
thereafter
a
beaver
dam
and
pond
together
form
a
factor
of
importance
in
the
keeping
of
streams
ever
flowing
the
pond
is
a
reservoir
which
catches
and
retains
some
of
the
water
coming
into
it
during
rainy
days
and
which
delays
the
through
it
a
beaver
pond
is
a
leaky
reservoir
a
kind
of
spring
as
it
were
and
if
stored
full
during
rainy
days
the
leakage
from
it
will
help
maintain
below
during
the
dry
weather
beaver
works
thus
tend
to
distribute
to
streams
a
moderate
quantity
of
water
each
day
in
other
words
they
spread
out
or
distribute
the
water
of
the
few
rainy
days
through
all
the
days
of
the
year
a
river
which
flows
steadily
throughout
the
year
is
of
inestimable
value
to
mankind
if
floods
sweep
a
river
they
do
damage
if
low
water
comes
the
wheels
of
steamers
and
of
factories
cease
to
move
and
a
dry
means
both
damage
and
death
numerous
beaver
colonies
along
the
sources
of
countless
streams
that
rise
in
the
hills
and
the
mountains
would
be
helpful
in
equalizing
the
flow
of
these
streams
i
hope
and
believe
that
before
many
years
every
rushing
brook
that
springs
from
a
great
watershed
will
be
steadied
in
a
poetic
pond
that
is
made
and
that
will
be
maintained
by
our
patient
persevering
friend
the
beaver
in
the
west
beaver
are
peculiarly
useful
at
where
their
ponds
store
flood
waters
that
may
later
be
used
for
stock
water
or
for
irrigation
purposes
there
are
a
number
of
localities
in
new
mexico
south
dakota
and
elsewhere
in
the
west
where
beaver
receive
the
utmost
protection
and
encouragement
from
ranchers
whose
herds
are
benefited
by
water
conveniently
stored
in
beaver
ponds
a
few
power
companies
in
the
country
have
commenced
to
stock
with
beaver
the
watersheds
which
supply
them
with
water
they
do
this
because
they
realize
that
countless
small
ponds
or
reservoirs
are
certain
to
be
constructed
by
these
little
conservationists
running
water
dissolves
and
erodes
away
the
earthy
materials
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
the
presence
of
a
beaver
pond
and
dam
across
a
stream
highway
prevents
the
wearing
and
the
carrying
away
of
material
they
not
only
prevent
erosion
or
wearing
away
but
they
take
soil
and
sediment
from
the
water
which
comes
to
them
and
thus
cause
an
upbuilding
hence
the
presence
of
beaver
ponds
along
streams
causes
an
accumulation
of
sediment
and
soil
in
time
these
fill
rocky
channels
and
cañons
widen
and
lengthen
valleys
and
thus
extend
the
productive
area
of
the
earth
beaver
ponds
are
and
in
them
are
deposited
the
heavier
matter
brought
in
by
the
stream
in
time
the
pond
is
filled
and
if
the
beaver
do
not
raise
the
height
of
the
dam
the
accumulated
earthy
matter
becomes
covered
with
flowers
or
forests
on
the
headwaters
of
the
arkansas
river
in
colorado
some
placer
miners
found
gold
in
the
sediment
of
an
inhabited
beaver
pond
in
washing
out
the
deposit
of
the
pond
they
broke
into
an
enormous
amount
of
loose
material
beneath
that
apparently
had
been
piled
in
there
by
glacial
action
this
material
when
removed
was
found
to
have
been
resting
in
an
ancient
beaver
pond
that
was
about
thirty
feet
below
the
one
at
the
surface
illustration
where
beaver
formerly
lived
and
spread
soil
a
few
centuries
ago
there
were
millions
of
beaver
ponds
in
north
america
most
of
these
were
long
since
filled
with
sediment
since
then
too
countless
others
have
been
formed
and
filled
this
and
still
goes
ever
on
wherever
there
is
a
beaver
pond
many
of
the
richest
tillable
lands
of
new
england
were
formed
by
the
artificial
works
of
the
beaver
there
are
hundreds
of
valleys
in
kansas
kentucky
missouri
illinois
and
other
states
whose
rich
surface
was
spread
upon
them
by
the
activities
of
beaver
through
generations
in
the
southern
states
and
in
the
mountains
of
the
west
the
numbers
of
beaver
meadows
are
beyond
computation
the
aggregate
area
of
rich
in
the
united
states
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
the
beaver
is
beyond
belief
and
probably
amounts
to
millions
of
acres
the
beaver
have
thus
prepared
the
way
for
forests
and
meadows
orchards
and
homes
and
in
the
golden
age
of
the
beaver
their
countless
colonies
clustered
all
over
our
land
these
primeval
folk
then
gathered
their
harvest
innumerable
beaver
ponds
which
then
shone
everywhere
in
the
sun
slowly
filled
with
deposited
outspreading
soil
and
vanished
elm
avenues
now
arch
where
the
willow
drooped
across
the
canal
and
a
populous
village
stands
upon
the
seat
of
a
primitive
and
forgotten
colony
a
live
beaver
is
more
valuable
to
mankind
than
a
dead
one
as
trappers
in
all
sections
of
the
country
occasionally
catch
a
beaver
it
is
probable
that
there
still
are
straggling
ones
scattered
along
streams
all
the
way
from
salt
water
up
to
twelve
thousand
feet
above
these
remaining
beaver
may
be
exterminated
but
if
protected
they
would
multiply
and
colonize
here
they
would
practise
conservation
their
presence
would
reduce
river
and
harbor
appropriations
and
make
rivers
more
manageable
useful
and
attractive
it
would
pay
us
to
keep
beaver
colonies
in
the
heights
beaver
would
help
keep
america
beautiful
a
beaver
colony
in
the
wilds
gives
a
touch
of
romance
and
a
rare
charm
to
the
outdoors
the
works
of
the
beaver
have
ever
intensely
interested
the
human
mind
beaver
works
may
do
for
children
what
schools
sermons
companions
and
even
home
sometimes
fail
to
do
develop
the
power
to
think
no
boy
or
girl
can
become
intimately
acquainted
with
the
ways
and
works
of
these
primitive
folk
without
having
the
eyes
of
observation
opened
and
acquiring
a
permanent
interest
in
the
wide
world
in
which
we
live
a
race
which
can
produce
mothers
and
fathers
as
noble
as
those
beaver
in
the
grand

who
offered
their
lives
hoping
thereby
to
save
their
