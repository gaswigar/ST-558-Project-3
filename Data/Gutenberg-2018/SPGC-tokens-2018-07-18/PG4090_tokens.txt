jessie
weston
from
ritual
to
romance
preface
in
the
introductory
chapter
the
reader
will
find
the
aim
and
object
of
these
studies
set
forth
at
length
in
view
of
the
importance
and
complexity
of
the
problems
involved
it
seemed
better
to
incorporate
such
a
statement
in
the
book
itself
rather
than
relegate
it
to
a
preface
which
all
might
not
trouble
to
read
yet
i
feel
that
such
a
general
statement
does
not
adequately
express
my
full
debt
of
obligation
among
the
many
whose
labour
has
been
laid
under
contribution
in
the
following
pages
there
are
certain
scholars
whose
published
work
or
personal
advice
has
been
specially
illuminating
and
to
whom
specific
acknowledgment
is
therefore
due
like
many
others
i
owe
to
sir
frazer
the
initial
inspiration
which
set
me
as
i
may
truly
say
on
the
road
to
the
grail
castle
without
the
guidance
of
the
golden
bough
i
should
probably
as
the
late
gaston
paris
happily
expressed
it
still
be
wandering
in
the
forest
of
broceliande
during
the
bayreuth
festival
of
i
had
frequent
opportunities
of
meeting
and
discussion
with
professor
von
schroeder
i
owe
to
him
not
only
the
introduction
to
his
own
work
which
i
found
most
helpful
but
references
which
have
been
of
the
greatest
assistance
my
knowledge
of
cumont
les
religions
orientales
and
valuable
study
on
fish
symbolism
both
of
which
have
furnished
important
links
in
the
chain
of
evidence
is
due
to
professor
von
schroeder
the
perusal
of
miss
harrison
themis
opened
my
eyes
to
the
extended
importance
of
these
vegetation
rites
in
view
of
the
evidence
there
adduced
i
asked
myself
whether
beliefs
which
had
found
expression
not
only
in
social
institution
and
popular
custom
but
as
set
forth
in
sir
murray
study
on
greek
dramatic
origins
attached
to
the
work
also
in
drama
and
literature
might
not
reasonably
even
inevitably
be
expected
to
have
left
their
mark
on
romance
the
one
seemed
to
me
a
necessary
corollary
of
the
other
and
i
felt
that
i
had
gained
as
the
result
of
miss
harrison
work
a
wider
and
more
assured
basis
for
my
own
researches
i
was
no
longer
engaged
merely
in
enquiring
into
the
sources
of
a
fascinating
legend
but
on
the
identification
of
another
field
of
activity
for
forces
whose
potency
as
agents
of
evolution
we
were
only
now
beginning
rightly
to
appreciate
finally
a
casual
reference
in
anrich
work
on
the
mysteries
to
the
naassene
document
caused
me
to
apply
to
mr
mead
of
whose
knowledge
of
the
mysterious
between
christianity
and
paganism
and
willingness
to
place
that
knowledge
at
the
disposal
of
others
i
had
for
some
years
past
had
pleasant
experience
mr
mead
referred
me
to
his
own
translation
and
analysis
of
the
text
in
question
and
there
to
my
satisfaction
i
found
not
only
the
final
link
that
completed
the
chain
of
evolution
from
pagan
mystery
to
christian
ceremonial
but
also
proof
of
that
wider
significance
i
was
beginning
to
apprehend
the
problem
involved
was
not
one
of
not
even
one
of
literature
but
of
comparative
religion
in
its
widest
sense
thus
while
i
trust
that
my
in
the
field
of
arthurian
research
will
accept
these
studies
as
a
permanent
contribution
to
the
elucidation
of
the
grail
problem
i
would
fain
hope
that
those
scholars
who
labour
in
a
wider
field
and
to
whose
works
i
owe
so
much
may
find
in
the
results
here
set
forth
elements
that
may
prove
of
real

many

seem
to
think

can
be
refuted
by
a
simple
demand
for

the
true
test
of
an

i
introductory
in

of
the
extensive
literature
to
which
the
grail
legend
has
already
given
birth
it
may
seem
that
the
addition
of
another
volume
to
the
already
existing
corpus
calls
for
some
words
of
apology
and
explanation
when
the
student
of
the
subject
contemplates
the
countless
essays
and
brochures
the
volumes
of
studies
and
criticism
which
have
been
devoted
to
this
fascinating
subject
the
conflicting
character
of
their
aims
their
hopelessly
contradictory
results
he
or
she
may
well
hesitate
before
adding
another
element
to
such
a
veritable
witches
cauldron
of
apparently
profitless
study
and
indeed
were
i
not
convinced
that
the
theory
advocated
in
the
following
pages
contains
in
itself
the
element
that
will
resolve
these
conflicting
ingredients
into
one
harmonious
compound
i
should
hardly
feel
justified
in
offering
a
further
contribution
to
the
subject
but
it
is
precisely
because
upwards
of
thirty
years
steady
and
persevering
study
of
the
grail
texts
has
brought
me
gradually
and
inevitably
to
certain
very
definite
conclusions
has
placed
me
in
possession
of
evidence
hitherto
ignored
or
unsuspected
that
i
venture
to
offer
the
result
in
these
studies
trusting
that
they
may
be
accepted
as
what
i
believe
them
to
be
a
genuine
elucidation
of
the
grail
problem
my
in
this
field
know
all
too
well
the
essential
elements
of
that
problem
i
do
not
need
here
to
go
over
already
ground
it
will
be
sufficient
to
point
out
certain
salient
features
of
the
position
the
main
difficulty
of
our
research
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
grail
legend
consists
of
a
congeries
of
widely
differing
elements
elements
which
at
first
sight
appear
hopelessly
incongruous
if
not
completely
contradictory
yet
at
the
same
time
are
present
to
an
extent
and
in
a
form
which
no
honest
critic
can
afford
to
ignore
thus
it
has
been
perfectly
possible
for
one
group
of
scholars
relying
upon
the
undeniably
elements
preponderant
in
certain
versions
to
maintain
the
thesis
that
the
grail
legend
is
ab
initio
a
christian
and
ecclesiastical
legend
and
to
analyse
the
literature
on
that
basis
alone
another
group
with
equal
reason
have
pointed
to
the
strongly
marked
features
preserved
in
the
tale
to
its
kinship
with
other
themes
mainly
of
celtic
provenance
and
have
argued
that
while
the
later
versions
of
the
cycle
have
been
worked
over
by
ecclesiastical
writers
in
the
interests
of
edification
the
story
itself
is
and
in
origin
both
groups
have
a
basis
of
truth
for
their
arguments
the
features
upon
which
they
rely
are
in
each
case
undeniably
present
yet
at
the
same
time
each
line
of
argument
is
faced
with
certain
insuperable
difficulties
fatal
to
the
claims
advanced
thus
the
theory
of
christian
origin
breaks
down
when
faced
with
the
awkward
fact
that
there
is
no
christian
legend
concerning
joseph
of
arimathea
and
the
grail
neither
in
legendary
nor
in
art
is
there
any
trace
of
the
story
it
has
no
existence
outside
the
grail
literature
it
is
the
creation
of
romance
and
no
genuine
tradition
on
this
very
ground
it
was
severely
criticized
by
the
dutch
writer
jacob
van
maerlant
in
in
his
merlin
he
denounces
the
whole
grail
history
as
lies
asserting
that
the
church
knows
nothing
of
it
which
is
true
in
the
same
way
the
advocate
of
a
origin
is
met
with
the
objection
that
the
section
of
the
cycle
for
which
such
a
source
can
be
definitely
proved
the
perceval
story
has
originally
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
grail
and
that
while
parallels
can
be
found
for
this
or
that
feature
of
the
legend
such
parallels
are
isolated
in
character
and
involve
the
breaking
up
of
the
tale
into
a
composite
of
mutually
independent
themes
a
prototype
containing
the
main
features
of
the
grail
story
the
waste
land
the
fisher
king
the
hidden
castle
with
its
solemn
feast
and
mysterious
feeding
vessel
the
bleeding
lance
and
cup
does
not
so
far
as
we
know
exist
none
of
the
great
collections
of
due
to
the
industry
of
a
cosquin
a
hartland
or
a
campbell
has
preserved
specimens
of
such
a
type
it
is
not
such
a
story
as
the
three
days
tournament
examples
of
which
are
found
all
over
the
world
yet
neither
the
advocate
of
a
christian
origin
nor
the
can
afford
to
ignore
the
arguments
and
evidence
of
the
opposing
school
and
while
the
result
of
half
a
century
of
patient
investigation
has
been
to
show
that
the
origin
of
the
grail
story
must
be
sought
elsewhere
than
in
ecclesiastical
legend
or
popular
tale
i
hold
that
the
result
has
equally
been
to
demonstrate
that
neither
of
these
solutions
should
be
ignored
but
that
the
ultimate
source
must
be
sought
for
in
a
direction
which
shall
do
justice
to
what
is
sound
in
the
claims
of
both
some
years
ago
when
fresh
from
the
study
of
sir
work
the
golden
bough
i
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
existing
between
certain
features
of
the
grail
story
and
characteristic
details
of
the
nature
cults
described
the
more
closely
i
analysed
the
tale
the
more
striking
became
the
resemblance
and
i
finally
asked
myself
whether
it
were
not
possible
that
in
this
mysterious
legend
mysterious
alike
in
its
character
its
sudden
appearance
the
importance
apparently
assigned
to
it
followed
by
as
sudden
and
complete
a
disappearance
we
might
not
have
the
confused
record
of
a
ritual
once
popular
later
surviving
under
conditions
of
strict
secrecy
this
would
fully
account
for
the
atmosphere
of
awe
and
reverence
which
even
under
distinctly
conditions
never
fails
to
surround
the
grail
it
may
act
simply
as
a
feeding
vessel
it
is
none
the
less
toute
sainte
cose
and
also
for
the
presence
in
the
tale
of
distinctly
popular
and
elements
such
an
interpretation
would
also
explain
features
irreconcilable
with
orthodox
christianity
which
had
caused
some
scholars
to
postulate
a
heterodox
origin
for
the
legend
and
thus
explain
its
curiously
complete
disappearance
as
a
literary
theme
in
the
first
volume
of
my
perceval
studies
published
in
i
hinted
at
this
possible
solution
of
the
problem
a
solution
worked
out
more
fully
in
a
paper
read
before
the
society
in
december
of
the
same
year
and
published
in
volume
xviii
of
the
journal
of
the
society
by
the
time
my
second
volume
of
studies
was
ready
for
publication
in
further
evidence
had
come
into
my
hands
i
was
then
certain
that
i
was
upon
the
right
path
and
i
felt
justified
in
laying
before
the
public
the
outlines
of
a
theory
of
evolution
alike
of
the
legend
and
of
the
literature
to
the
main
principles
of
which
i
adhere
but
certain
links
were
missing
in
the
chain
of
evidence
and
the
work
was
not
complete
no
inconsiderable
part
of
the
information
at
my
disposal
depended
upon
personal
testimony
the
testimony
of
those
who
knew
of
the
continued
existence
of
such
a
ritual
and
had
actually
been
initiated
into
its
mysteries
and
for
such
evidence
the
student
of
the
letter
has
little
respect
he
worships
the
written
word
for
the
oral
living
tradition
from
which
the
word
derives
force
and
vitality
he
has
little
use
therefore
the
written
word
had
to
be
found
it
has
taken
me
some
nine
or
ten
years
longer
to
complete
the
evidence
but
the
chain
is
at
last
linked
up
and
we
can
now
prove
by
printed
texts
the
parallels
existing
between
each
and
every
feature
of
the
grail
story
and
the
recorded
symbolism
of
the
mystery
cults
further
we
can
show
that
between
these
mystery
cults
and
christianity
there
existed
at
one
time
a
close
and
intimate
union
such
a
union
as
of
itself
involved
the
practical
assimilation
of
the
central
rite
in
each
case
a
feast
in
which
the
worshippers
partook
of
the
food
of
life
from
the
sacred
vessels
in
face
of
the
proofs
which
will
be
found
in
these
pages
i
do
not
think
any
critic
will
be
inclined
to
dispute
any
longer
the
origin
of
the
grail
after
all
it
is
as
august
and
ancient
an
origin
as
the
most
tenacious
upholder
of
its
christian
character
could
desire
but
i
should
wish
it
clearly
to
be
understood
that
the
aim
of
these
studies
is
as
indicated
in
the
title
to
determine
the
origin
of
the
grail
not
to
discuss
the
provenance
and
interrelation
of
the
different
versions
i
do
not
believe
this
latter
task
can
be
satisfactorily
achieved
unless
and
until
we
are
of
one
accord
as
to
the
character
of
the
subject
matter
when
we
have
made
up
our
minds
as
to
what
the
grail
really
was
and
what
it
stood
for
we
shall
be
able
to
analyse
the
romances
to
decide
which
of
them
contains
more
which
less
of
the
original
matter
and
to
group
them
accordingly
on
this
point
i
believe
that
the
table
of
descent
printed
in
volume
ii
of
my
perceval
studies
is
in
the
main
correct
but
there
is
still
much
analytical
work
to
be
done
in
particular
the
establishment
of
the
original
form
of
the
perlesvaus
is
highly
desirable
but
apart
from
the
primary
object
of
these
studies
and
the
results
therein
obtained
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
the
evidence
set
forth
in
the
chapters
on
the
mystery
cults
and
especially
that
on
the
naassene
document
a
text
of
extraordinary
value
from
more
than
one
point
of
view
supports
and
complements
the
researches
of
sir
frazer
i
am
of
course
familiar
with
the
attacks
directed
against
the
theory
the
sarcasms
of
which
it
has
been
the
object
and
the
criticisms
of
what
is
held
in
some
quarters
to
be
the
exaggerated
importance
attached
to
these
nature
cults
but
in
view
of
the
use
made
of
these
cults
as
the
medium
of
imparting
high
spiritual
teaching
a
use
which
in
face
of
the
document
above
referred
to
can
no
longer
be
ignored
or
evaded
are
we
not
rather
justified
in
asking
if
the
true
importance
of
the
rites
has
as
yet
been
recognized
can
we
possibly
exaggerate
their
value
as
a
factor
in
the
evolution
of
religious
consciousness
such
a
development
of
his
researches
naturally
lay
outside
the
range
of
sir
frazer
work
but
posterity
will
probably
decide
that
like
many
another
patient
and
honest
worker
he
better
than
he
knew
i
have
carefully
read
sir
ridgeway
attack
on
the
school
in
his
dramas
and
dramatic
dances
and
while
the
above
remarks
explain
my
position
with
regard
to
the
question
as
a
whole
i
would
here
take
the
opportunity
of
stating
specifically
my
grounds
for
dissenting
from
certain
of
the
conclusions
at
which
the
learned
author
arrives
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
said
this
is
all
very
well
but
miss
weston
ignores
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
i
do
not
ignore
but
i
do
not
admit
their
validity
it
is
perfectly
obvious
that
sir
ridgeway
theory
reduced
to
abstract
terms
would
result
in
the
conclusion
that
all
religion
is
based
upon
the
cult
of
the
dead
and
that
men
originally
knew
no
gods
but
their
grandfathers
a
theory
from
which
as
a
student
of
religion
i
absolutely
and
entirely
dissent
i
can
understand
that
such
dead
ancestors
can
be
looked
upon
as
protectors
or
as
benefactors
but
i
see
no
ground
for
supposing
that
they
have
ever
been
regarded
as
creators
yet
it
is
precisely
as
vehicle
for
the
most
lofty
teaching
as
to
the
cosmic
relations
existing
between
god
and
man
that
these
vegetation
cults
were
employed
the
more
closely
one
studies
theology
the
more
strongly
one
is
impressed
with
the
deeply
and
daringly
spiritual
character
of
its
speculations
and
the
more
doubtful
it
appears
that
such
teaching
can
depend
upon
the
unaided
processes
of
human
thought
or
can
have
been
evolved
from
such
germs
as
we
find
among
the
supposedly
peoples
such
as
the
australian
tribes
are
they
really
primitive
or
are
we
dealing
not
with
the
primary
elements
of
religion
but
with
the
disjecta
membra
of
a
vanished
civilization
certain
it
is
that
so
far
as
historical
evidence
goes
our
earliest
records
point
to
the
recognition
of
a
spiritual
not
of
a
material
origin
of
the
human
race
the
sumerian
and
babylonian
psalms
were
not
composed
by
men
who
believed
themselves
the
descendants
of
grubs
the
folk
practices
and
ceremonies
studied
in
these
pages
the
dances
the
rough
dramas
the
local
and
seasonal
celebrations
do
not
represent
the
material
out
of
which
the
cult
was
formed
but
surviving
fragments
of
a
worship
from
which
the
higher
significance
has
vanished
sir
ridgeway
is
confident
that
osiris
attis
adonis
were
all
at
one
time
human
beings
whose
tragic
fate
gripped
hold
of
popular
imagination
and
led
to
their
ultimate
deification
the
cult
stands
on
a
somewhat
different
basis
from
the
others
the
beneficent
activities
of
osiris
being
more
widely
diffused
more
universal
in
their
operation
i
should
be
inclined
to
regard
the
egyptian
deity
primarily
as
a
culture
hero
rather
than
a
vegetation
god
with
regard
to
attis
and
adonis
whatever
their
original
character
and
it
seems
to
me
highly
improbable
that
there
should
have
been
two
youths
each
beloved
by
a
goddess
each
victim
of
a
similar
untimely
fate
long
before
we
have
any
trace
of
them
both
have
become
so
intimately
identified
with
the
processes
of
nature
that
they
have
ceased
to
be
men
and
become
gods
and
as
such
alone
can
we
deal
with
them
it
is
also
permissible
to
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
tammuz
esmun
and
adonis
the
title
is
not
a
proper
name
but
a
vague
appellative
denoting
an
abstract
rather
than
a
concrete
origin
proof
of
this
will
be
found
later
sir
ridgeway
overlooks
the
fact
that
it
is
not
the
tragic
death
of
which
is
of
importance
for
these
cults
but
their
subsequent
restoration
to
life
a
feature
which
can
not
be
postulated
of
any
ordinary
mortal
and
how
are
we
to
regard
tammuz
the
prototype
of
all
these
deities
is
there
any
possible
ground
for
maintaining
that
he
was
ever
a
man
prove
it
we
can
not
as
the
records
of
his
cult
go
back
thousands
of
years
before
our
era
here
again
we
have
the
same
dominant
feature
it
is
not
merely
the
untimely
death
which
is
lamented
but
the
restoration
to
life
which
is
celebrated
throughout
the
whole
study
the
author
fails
to
discriminate
between
the
activities
of
the
living
and
the
dead
king
the
dead
king
may
as
i
have
said
above
be
regarded
as
the
benefactor
as
the
protector
of
his
people
but
it
is
the
living
king
upon
whom
their
actual
and
continued
prosperity
depends
the
detail
that
the
ruling
sovereign
is
sometimes
regarded
as
the
of
the
original
founder
of
the
race
strengthens
this
point
the
king
never
dies
le
roi
est
mort
vive
le
roi
is
very
emphatically
the
motto
of
this
faith
it
is
the
insistence
on
life
life
continuous
and
which
is
the
abiding
characteristic
of
these
cults
a
characteristic
which
differentiates
them
utterly
and
entirely
from
the
ancestral
worship
with
which
sir
ridgeway
would
fain
connect
them
nor
are
the
arguments
based
upon
the
memorial
rites
of
definitely
historical
heroes
of
comparatively
late
date
such
as
hussein
and
hossein
of
any
value
here
it
is
precisely
the
death
and
not
the
resurrection
of
the
martyr
which
is
of
the
essence
of
the
muharram
no
one
contends
that
hussein
rose
from
the
dead
but
it
is
precisely
this
point
which
is
of
primary
importance
in
the
nature
cults
and
sir
ridgeway
must
surely
be
aware
that
find
in
this
very
muharram
distinct
traces
of
borrowing
from
the
earlier
vegetation
rites
the
author
triumphantly
asserts
that
the
fact
that
certain
burmese
heroes
and
heroines
are
after
death
reverenced
as
tree
spirits
at
rest
for
ever
the
belief
in
abstract
deities
but
how
can
he
be
sure
that
the
process
was
not
the
reverse
of
that
which
he
postulates
that
certain
natural
objects
trees
rivers
were
not
regarded
as
sacred
before
the
nats
became
connected
with
them
that
the
deified
human
beings
were
not
after
death
assigned
to
places
already
held
in
reverence
such
a
possibility
is
obvious
to
any
student
and
local
traditions
should
in
each
case
be
carefully
examined
before
the
contrary
is
definitely
asserted
so
far
as
the
origins
of
drama
are
concerned
the
ode
quoted
later
from
the
naassene
document
is
absolute
and
definite
proof
of
the
close
connection
existing
between
the
attis
mystery
ritual
and
dramatic
performances
attis
regarded
in
his
deified
creative
aspect
not
attis
the
dead
youth
nor
do
i
think
that
the
idea
of
can
be
lightly
dismissed
as
ordinary
case
of
relics
the
influence
may
well
be
something
entirely
apart
from
the
continued
existence
of
the
ancestor
an
independent
force
assisting
him
in
life
and
transferring
itself
after
death
to
his
successor
a
sword
or
staff
is
not
necessarily
a
relic
medieval
romance
supplies
numerous
instances
of
weapons
whose
virtue
in
no
wise
depends
upon
their
previous
owner
as
the
sword
in
le
chevalier
ŕ
or
the
flaming
lance
of
the
chevalier
de
la
charrette
doubtless
the
cult
of
ancestors
plays
a
large
rôle
in
the
beliefs
of
certain
peoples
but
it
is
not
a
sufficiently
solid
foundation
to
bear
the
weight
of
the
sir
ridgeway
would
fain
rear
upon
it
while
it
differs
too
radically
from
the
cults
he
attacks
to
be
used
as
an
argument
against
them
the
one
is
based
upon
death
the
other
on
life
wherefore
in
spite
of
all
the
learning
and
ingenuity
brought
to
bear
against
it
i
avow
myself
an
impenitent
believer
in
sir
main
theory
and
as
i
have
said
above
i
hold
that
theory
to
be
of
greater
and
more
importance
than
has
been
hitherto
suspected
i
would
add
a
few
words
as
to
the
form
of
these
studies
they
may
be
found
disconnected
they
have
been
written
at
intervals
of
time
extending
over
several
years
and
my
aim
has
been
to
prove
the
essentially
archaic
character
of
all
the
elements
composing
the
grail
story
rather
than
to
analyse
the
story
as
a
connected
whole
with
this
aim
in
view
i
have
devoted
chapters
to
features
which
have
now
either
dropped
out
of
the
existing
versions
or
only
survive
in
a
subordinate
form
the
chapters
on
the
medicine
man
and
the
freeing
of
the
waters
the
studies
will
i
hope
and
believe
be
accepted
as
offering
a
definite
contribution
towards
establishing
the
fundamental
character
of
our
material
as
stated
above
when
we
are
all
at
one
as
to
what
the
holy
grail
really
was
and
is
we
can
then
proceed
with
some
hope
of
success
to
criticize
the
manner
in
which
different
writers
have
handled
the
inspiring
theme
but
such
success
seems
to
be
hopeless
so
long
as
we
all
start
from
different
and
often
utterly
irreconcilable
standpoints
and
proceed
along
widely
diverging
roads
one
or
another
may
indeed
arrive
at
the
goal
but
such
unanimity
of
opinion
as
will
lend
to
our
criticism
authoritative
weight
is
on
such
lines
impossible
of
achievement
chapter
ii
the
task
of
the
hero
as
a
first
step
towards
the
successful
prosecution
of
an
investigation
into
the
true
nature
and
character
of
the
mysterious
object
we
know
as
the
grail
it
will
be
well
to
ask
ourselves
whether
any
light
may
be
thrown
upon
the
subject
by
examining
more
closely
the
details
of
the
quest
in
its
varying
forms
what
was
the
precise
character
of
the
task
undertaken
by
or
imposed
upon
the
grail
hero
whether
that
hero
were
gawain
perceval
or
galahad
and
what
the
results
to
be
expected
from
a
successful
achievement
of
the
task
we
shall
find
at
once
a
uniformity
which
assures
us
of
the
essential
identity
of
the
tradition
underlying
the
varying
forms
and
a
diversity
indicating
that
the
tradition
has
undergone
a
gradual
but
radical
modification
in
the
process
of
literary
evolution
taken
in
their
relative
order
the
versions
give
the
following
result
gawain
bleheris
here
the
hero
sets
out
on
his
journey
with
no
clear
idea
of
the
task
before
him
he
is
taking
the
place
of
a
knight
mysteriously
slain
in
his
company
but
whither
he
rides
and
why
he
does
not
know
only
that
the
business
is
important
and
pressing
from
the
records
of
his
partial
success
we
gather
that
he
ought
to
have
enquired
concerning
the
nature
of
the
grail
and
that
this
enquiry
would
have
resulted
in
the
restoration
to
fruitfulness
of
a
waste
land
the
desolation
of
which
is
in
some
manner
not
clearly
explained
connected
with
the
death
of
a
knight
whose
name
and
identity
are
never
disclosed
great
is
the
loss
that
ye
lie
thus
even
the
destruction
of
kingdoms
god
grant
that
ye
be
avenged
so
that
the
folk
be
once
more
joyful
and
the
land
repeopled
which
by
ye
and
this
sword
are
wasted
and
made
void
the
fact
that
gawain
does
ask
concerning
the
lance
assures
the
partial
restoration
of
the
land
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
special
terms
in
which
this
is
described
for
so
soon
as
sir
gawain
asked
of
the
lance
the
waters
flowed
again
thro
their
channel
and
all
the
woods
were
turned
to
verdure
diű
crône
here
the
question
is
more
general
in
character
it
affects
the
marvels
beheld
not
the
grail
alone
but
now
the
quester
is
prepared
and
knows
what
is
expected
of
him
the
result
is
to
break
the
spell
which
retains
the
grail
king
in
a
semblance
of
life
and
we
learn
by
implication
that
the
land
is
restored
to
fruitfulness
yet
had
the
land
been
waste
but
by
his
coming
had
folk
and
land
alike
been
delivered
thus
in
the
earliest
preserved
the
gawain
form
the
effect
upon
the
land
appears
to
be
the
primary
result
of
the
quest
perceval
the
perceval
versions
which
form
the
bulk
of
the
existing
grail
texts
differ
considerably
the
one
from
the
other
alike
in
the
task
to
be
achieved
and
the
effects
resulting
from
the
success
or
failure
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
perceval
version
is
the
insistence
upon
the
sickness
and
disability
of
the
ruler
of
the
land
the
fisher
king
regarded
first
as
the
direct
cause
of
the
wasting
of
the
land
it
gradually
assumes
overwhelming
importance
the
task
of
the
quester
becomes
that
of
healing
the
king
the
restoration
of
the
land
not
only
falls
into
the
background
but
the
operating
cause
of
its
desolation
is
changed
and
finally
it
disappears
from
the
story
altogether
one
version
alone
the
source
of
which
is
at
present
undetermined
links
the
perceval
with
the
gawain
form
this
is
the
version
preserved
in
the
gerbert
continuation
of
the
perceval
of
chrétien
de
troyes
here
the
hero
having
like
gawain
partially
achieved
the
task
but
again
like
gawain
having
failed
satisfactorily
to
resolder
the
broken
sword
wakes
like
the
earlier
hero
to
find
that
the
grail
castle
has
disappeared
and
he
is
alone
in
a
flowery
meadow
he
pursues
his
way
through
a
land
fertile
and
and
marvels
much
for
the
day
before
it
had
been
a
waste
desert
coming
to
a
castle
he
is
received
by
a
solemn
procession
with
great
rejoicing
through
him
the
folk
have
regained
the
land
and
goods
which
they
had
lost
the
mistress
of
the
castle
is
more
explicit
perceval
had
asked
concerning
the
grail

like

he

and
thus
restored
the
land
in
the
prose
perceval
the
motif
of
the
waste
land
has
disappeared
the
task
of
the
hero
consists
in
asking
concerning
the
grail
and
by
so
doing
to
restore
the
fisher
king
who
is
suffering
from
extreme
old
age
to
health
and
youth

here
we
have
the
introduction
of
a
new
element
the
restoration
to
youth
of
the
sick
king
in
the
perceval
of
chrétien
de
troyes
we
find
ourselves
in
presence
of
certain
definite
changes
neither
slight
nor
unimportant
upon
which
it
seems
to
me
insufficient
stress
has
hitherto
been
laid
the
question
is
changed
the
hero
no
longer
asks
what
the
grail
is
but
as
in
the
prose
perceval
whom
it
serves
a
departure
from
an
essential
and
primitive
simplicity
the
motive
for
which
is
apparent
in
chrétien
but
not
in
the
prose
form
where
there
is
no
enigmatic
personality
to
be
served
apart
a
far
more
important
change
is
that
while
the
malady
of
the
fisher
king
is
antecedent
to
the
hero
visit
and
capable
of
cure
if
the
question
be
asked
the
failure
to
fulfil
the
prescribed
conditions
of
itself
entails
disaster
upon
the
land
thus
the
sickness
of
the
king
and
the
desolation
of
the
land
are
not
necessarily
connected
as
cause
and
effect
but
a
point
which
seems
hitherto
unaccountably
to
have
been
overlooked
the
latter
is
directly
attributable
to
the
quester
himself
car

by

he
has
entailed

this
idea
that
the
misfortunes
of
the
land
are
not
antecedent
to
but
dependent
upon
the
hero
abortive
visit
to
the
grail
castle
is
carried
still
further
by
the
compiler
of
the
perlesvaus
where
the
failure
of
the
predestined
hero
to
ask
concerning
the
office
of
the
grail
is
alone
responsible
for
the
illness
of
the
king
and
the
misfortunes
of
the
country

from
this
cause
the

king
dies
before
the
hero
has
achieved
the
task
and
can
take
his
place
li

there
is
here
no
cure
of
the
king
or
restoration
of
the
land
the
specific
task
of
the
grail
hero
is
never
accomplished
he
comes
into
his
kingdom
as
the
result
of
a
number
of
knightly
adventures
neither
more
nor
less
significant
than
those
found
in
romances
the
perlesvaus
in
its
present
form
appears
to
be
a
later
and
more
fully
developed
treatment
of
the
motif
noted
in
chrétien
that
the
misfortunes
of
king
and
country
are
directly
due
to
the
quester
himself
and
had
no
antecedent
existence
this
i
would
submit
alters
the
whole
character
of
the
story
and
we
are
at
a
loss
to
know
what
had
the
hero
put
the
question
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
could
possibly
have
been
the
result
achieved
it
would
not
have
been
the
cure
of
the
king
he
was
apparently
in
perfect
health
it
would
not
have
been
the
restoration
to
verdure
of
the
land
the
land
was
not
waste
where
as
in
the
case
of
gawain
there
is
a
dead
knight
whose
death
is
to
be
avenged
something
might
have
been
achieved
in
the
case
of
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
perceval
versions
which
do
not
contain
this
feature
the
dependence
of
the
curse
upon
the
quester
reduces
the
story
to
incoherence
in
one
perceval
version
alone
do
we
find
a
motif
analogous
to
the
earlier
gawain
bleheris
form
in
manessier
the
hero
task
is
not
restricted
to
the
simple
asking
of
a
question
but
he
must
also
slay
the
enemy
whose
treachery
has
caused
the
death
of
the
fisher
king
brother
thereby
healing
the
wound
of
the
king
himself
and
removing
the
woes
of
the
land
what
these
may
be
we
are
not
told
but
apparently
the
country
is
not
in
peredur
we
have
a
version
closely
agreeing
with
that
of
chrétien
the
hero
fails
to
enquire
the
meaning
of
what
he
sees
in
the
castle
of
wonders
and
is
told
in
consequence
hadst
thou
done
so
the
king
would
have
been
restored
to
health
and
his
dominions
to
peace
whereas
from
henceforth
he
will
have
to
endure
battles
and
conflicts
and
his
knights
will
perish
and
wives
will
be
widowed
and
maidens
will
be
left
portionless
and
all
this
because
of
thee
this
certainly
seems
to
imply
that
while
the
illness
of
the
fisher
king
may
be
antecedent
to
and
independent
of
the
visit
and
failure
of
the
hero
the
misfortunes
which
fall
on
the
land
have
been
directly
caused
thereby
the
conclusion
which
states
that
the
bleeding
head
seen
by
the
hero
was
thy
cousin
and
he
was
killed
by
the
sorceresses
of
gloucester
who
also
lamed
thine
uncle
and
there
is
a
prediction
that
thou
art
to
avenge
these
things
would
seem
to
indicate
the
presence
in
the
original
of
a
theme
such
as
that
referred
to
above
in
parzival
the
stress
is
laid
entirely
on
the
sufferings
of
the
king
the
question
has
been
modified
in
the
interests
of
this
theme
and
here
assumes
the
form
what
aileth
thee
mine
uncle
the
blame
bestowed
upon
the
hero
is
solely
on
account
of
the
prolonged
sorrow
his
silence
has
inflicted
on
king
and
people
of
a
land
laid
waste
either
through
drought
or
war

the
punishment
falls
on
the
hero
who
has
failed
to
put
the
question
rather
than
on
the
land
which
indeed
appears
to
be
in
no
way
affected
either
by
the
wound
of
the
king
or
the
silence
of
the
hero
the
divergence
from
chrétien
version
is
here
very
marked
and
so
far
seems
to
have
been
neglected
by
critics
the
point
is
also
of
importance
in
view
of
the
curious
parallels
which
are
otherwise
to
be
found
between
this
version
and
perlesvaus
here
the
two
are
in
marked
contradiction
with
one
another
the
question
finally
asked
the
result
is
as
indicated
in
the
prose
version
the
restoration
of
the
king
not
merely
to
health
but
also
to
youth

the
achievement

the
task
is
not
preceded
by
any
failure
on
the
part
of
the
hero
and
the
advantages
derived
therefrom
are
personal
and
spiritual
though
we
are
incidentally
told
that
he
heals
the
fisher
king
father
and
also
the
old
king
mordrains
whose
life
has
been
preternaturally
prolonged
in
the
case
of
this
latter
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
mere
fact
of
galahad
being
the
predestined
winner
suffices
and
the
healing
takes
place
before
the
quest
is
definitely
achieved
there
is
no
waste
land
and
the
wounding
of
the
two
kings
is
entirely
unconnected
with
galahad
we
find
hints
in
the
story
of
lambar
of
a
knowledge
of
the
earlier
form

for
all
practical
purposes
it
has
disappeared
from
the
story
analysing
the
above
statements
we
find
that
the
results
may
be
grouped
under
certain
definite
headings
a
there
is
a
general
consensus
of
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
main
object
of
the
quest
is
the
restoration
to
health
and
vigour
of
a
king
suffering
from
infirmity
caused
by
wounds
sickness
or
old
age

and
whose
infirmity
for
some
mysterious
and
unexplained
reason
reacts
disastrously
upon
his
kingdom

depriving
it
of
vegetation
or
exposing
it
to
the
ravages
of
war

in
two
cases
it
is
definitely
stated
that
the
king
will
be
restored
to
youthful
vigour
and
beauty
d
in
both
cases
where
we
find
gawain
as
the
hero
of
the
story
and
in
one
connected
with
perceval
the
misfortune
which
has
fallen
upon
the
country
is
that
of
a
prolonged
drought
which
has
destroyed
vegetation
and
left
the
land
waste
the
effect
of
the
hero
question
is
to
restore
the
waters
to
their
channel
and
render
the
land
once
more
fertile
e
in
three
cases
the
misfortunes
and
wasting
of
the
land
are
the
result
of
war
and
directly
caused
by
the
hero
failure
to
ask
the
question
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
antecedent
condition
this
in
my
opinion
constitutes
a
marked
difference
between
the
two
groups
which
has
not
hitherto
received
the
attention
it
deserves
one
aim
of
our
present
investigation
will
be
to
determine
which
of
these
two
forms
should
be
considered
the
elder
but
this
much
seems
certain
the
aim
of
the
grail
quest
is
it
is
to
benefit
a
the
king
b
the
land
the
first
of
these
two
is
the
more
important
as
it
is
the
infirmity
of
the
king
which
entails
misfortune
on
his
land
the
condition
of
the
one
reacts
for
good
or
ill
upon
the
other
how
or
why
we
are
left
to
discover
for
ourselves
before
proceeding
further
in
our
investigation
it
may
be
well
to
determine
the
precise
nature
of
the
king
illness
and
see
whether
any
light
upon
the
problem
can
be
thus
obtained
in
both
the
gawain
forms
the
person
upon
whom
the
fertility
of
the
land
depends
is
dead
though
in
the
version
of
diű
crône
he
is
to
all
appearance
still
in
life
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
bleheris
form
the
king
of
the
castle
who
is
not
referred
to
as
the
fisher
king
is
himself
hale
and
sound
the
wasting
of
the
land
was
brought
about
by
the
blow
which
slew
the
knight
whose
body
gawain
sees
on
the
bier
in
both
the
perlesvaus
and
the
prose
perceval
the
king
has
simply
into
languishment
in
the
first
instance
as
noted
above
on
account
of
the
failure
of
the
quester
in
the
second
as
the
result
of
extreme
old
age
in
chrétien
manessier
peredur
and
the
parzival
the
king
is
suffering
from
a
wound
the
nature
of
which
euphemistically
disguised
in
the
french
texts
is
quite
clearly
explained
in
the
german
but
the
whole
position
is
made
absolutely
clear
by
a
passage
preserved
in
sone
de
nansai
and
obviously
taken
over
from
an
earlier
poem
this
romance
contains
a
lengthy
section
dealing
with
the
history
of
joseph
who
is
represented
as
the
patron
saint
of
the
kingdom
of
norway
his
bones
with
the
sacred
relics
of
which
he
had
the
charge
the
grail
and
the
lance
are
preserved
in
a
monastery
on
an
island
in
the
interior
of
that
country
in
this
version
joseph
himself
is
the
fisher
king
ensnared
by
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
of
the
pagan
king
of
norway
whom
he
has
slain
he
baptizes
her
though
she
is
still
an
unbeliever
at
heart
and
makes
her
his
wife
thus
drawing
the
wrath
of
heaven
upon
himself
god
punishes
him
for
his
sin
es

et

endura
then
in
a
remarkable
passage
we
are
told
of
the
direful
result
entailed
by
this
punishment
upon
his
land

now
there
can
be
no
possible
doubt
here
the
condition
of
the
king
is
sympathetically
reflected
on
the
land
the
loss
of
virility
in
the
one
brings
about
a
suspension
of
the
reproductive
processes
of
nature
on
the
other
the
same
effect
would
naturally
be
the
result
of
the
death
of
the
sovereign
upon
whose
vitality
these
processes
depended
to
sum
up
the
result
of
the
analysis
i
hold
that
we
have
solid
grounds
for
the
belief
that
the
story
postulates
a
close
connection
between
the
vitality
of
a
certain
king
and
the
prosperity
of
his
kingdom
the
forces
of
the
ruler
being
weakened
or
destroyed
by
wound
sickness
old
age
or
death
the
land
becomes
waste
and
the
task
of
the
hero
is
that
of
restoration
it
seems
to
me
then
that
if
we
desire
to
elucidate
the
perplexing
mystery
of
the
grail
romances
and
to
place
the
criticism
of
this
important
and
singularly
fascinating
body
of
literature
upon
an
assured
basis
we
shall
do
so
most
effectually
by
pursuing
a
line
of
investigation
which
will
concentrate
upon
the
persistent
elements
of
the
story
the
character
and
significance
of
the
achievement
proposed
rather
than
upon
the
varying
details
such
as
grail
and
lance
however
important
may
be
their
rôle
if
we
can
ascertain
accurately
and
unmistakably
the
meaning
of
the
whole
we
shall
i
think
find
less
difficulty
in
determining
the
character
and
office
of
the
parts
in
fact
the
question
solvitur
ambulando
the
of
the
problem
being
solved
the
constituent
elements
will
reveal
their
significance
as
a
first
step
i
propose
to
ask
whether
this
of
the
represents
an
isolated
and
unique
achievement
or
whether
the
task
allotted
to
the
hero
gawain
perceval
or
galahad
is
one
that
has
been
undertaken
and
carried
out
by
heroes
of
other
ages
and
other
lands
in
the
process
of
our
investigation
we
must
retrace
our
steps
and
turn
back
to
the
early
traditions
of
our
aryan
forefathers
and
see
whether
we
can
not
even
in
that
remote
antiquity
lay
our
hand
upon
a
clue
which
like
the
fabled
thread
of
ariadne
shall
serve
as
guide
through
the
mazes
of
a
varying
yet
curiously
persistent
tradition
chapter
iii
the
freeing
of
the
waters
begin
at
the
beginning
was
the
old
formula
and
it
was
a
very
sound
one
if
beginning
could
only
be
definitely
ascertained
as
our
nearest
possible
approach
to
it
i
would
draw
attention
to
certain
curious
parallels
in
the
earliest
literary
monuments
of
our
race
i
would
at
the
same
time
beg
those
scholars
who
may
think
it
far
cry
from
the
romances
of
the
twelfth
century
of
our
era
to
some
years
to
suspend
their
judgment
till
they
have
fairly
examined
the
evidence
for
a
tradition
common
to
the
aryan
race
in
general
and
persisting
with
extraordinary
vitality
and
a
marked
correspondence
of
characteristic
detail
through
all
migrations
and
modifications
of
that
race
down
to
the
present
day
turning
back
to
the
earliest
existing
literary
evidence
the
we
become
aware
that
in
this
vast
collection
of
over
poems
it
is
commonly
known
as
the
thousand
and
one
hymns
but
the
poems
contained
in
it
are
more
than
that
in
number
are
certain
parallels
with
our
grail
stories
which
if
taken
by
themselves
are
perhaps
interesting
and
suggestive
rather
than
in
any
way
conclusive
yet
which
when
they
are
considered
in
relation
to
the
entire
body
of
evidence
assume
a
curious
significance
and
importance
we
must
first
note
that
a
very
considerable
number
of
the
hymns
depend
for
their
initial
inspiration
on
the
actual
bodily
needs
and
requirements
of
a
mainly
agricultural
population
of
a
people
that
depend
upon
the
fruits
of
the
earth
for
their
subsistence
and
to
whom
the
regular
and
ordered
sequence
of
the
processes
of
nature
was
a
vital
necessity
their
hymns
and
prayers
and
as
we
have
strong
reason
to
suppose
their
dramatic
ritual
were
devised
for
the
main
purpose
of
obtaining
from
the
gods
of
their
worship
that
which
was
essential
to
ensure
their
and
the
fertility
of
their
land
warmth
sunshine
above
all
sufficient
water
that
this
last
should
in
an
eastern
land
under
a
tropical
sun
become
a
point
of
supreme
importance
is
easily
to
be
understood
there
is
consequently
small
cause
for
surprise
when
we
find
throughout
the
collection
the
god
who
bestows
upon
them
this
much
desired
boon
to
be
the
one
to
whom
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
hymns
are
addressed
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
enter
into
a
discussion
as
to
the
original
conception
of
indra
and
the
place
occupied
by
him
in
the
early
aryan
pantheon
whether
he
was
originally
regarded
as
a
god
of
war
or
a
god
of
weather
what
is
important
for
our
purpose
is
the
fact
that
it
is
indra
to
whom
a
disproportionate
number
of
the
hymns
of
the
are
addressed
that
it
is
from
him
the
much
desired
boon
of
rain
and
abundant
water
is
besought
and
that
the
feat
which
above
all
others
redounded
to
his
praise
and
is
ceaselessly
glorified
both
by
the
god
himself
and
his
grateful
worshippers
is
precisely
the
feat
by
which
the
grail
heroes
gawain
and
perceval
rejoiced
the
hearts
of
a
suffering
folk
the
restoration
of
the
rivers
to
their
channels
the
of
the
waters
tradition
relates
that
the
seven
great
rivers
of
india
had
been
imprisoned
by
the
evil
giant
vritra
or
ahi
whom
indra
slew
thereby
releasing
the
streams
from
their
captivity
the
hymns
abound
in
references
to
this
feat
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
cite
a
few
from
among
the
numerous
passages
i
have
noted
hast
set
loose
the
seven
rivers
to
flow
causest
water
to
flow
on
every
side
set
free
the
waters
indra
hast
slain
vritra
by
thy
vigour
thou
hast
set
free
the
rivers
hast
slain
the
slumbering
ahi
for
the
release
of
the
waters
and
hast
marked
out
the
channels
of
the
rivers
has
filled
the
rivers
he
has
inundated
the
dry
land
has
released
the
imprisoned
waters
to
flow
upon
the
earth
it
would
be
easy
to
fill
pages
with
similar
quotations
but
these
are
sufficient
for
our
purpose
among
the
hymns
are
certain
poems
in
dialogue
form
which
from
their
curious
and
elliptic
character
have
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
among
scholars
professor
oldenberg
in
drawing
attention
to
their
peculiarities
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
these
poems
were
the
remains
of
a
distinct
type
of
early
indian
literature
where
verses
forming
the
central
and
illuminating
point
of
a
formal
ceremonial
recital
had
been
with
illustrative
and
explanatory
prose
passages
the
form
of
the
verses
being
fixed
that
of
the
prose
being
varied
at
the
will
of
the
reciter
this
theory
which
is
technically
known
as
the
theory
as
it
derived
its
starting
point
from
the
discussion
of
the
suparnâkhyâna
text
won
considerable
support
but
was
contested
by
sylvain
lévi
who
asserted
that
in
these
hymns
we
had
the
remains
of
the
earliest
and
oldest
indian
dramatic
creations
the
beginning
of
the
indian
drama
and
that
the
fragments
could
only
be
satisfactorily
interpreted
from
the
point
of
view
that
they
were
intended
to
be
spoken
not
by
a
solitary
reciter
but
by
two
or
more
dramatis
personae
hertel
der
ursprung
des
indischen
dramas
und
epos
went
still
further
and
while
accepting
and
demonstrating
the
justice
of
this
interpretation
of
the
poems
suggested
a
similar
origin
for
certain
found
in
the
same
collection
professor
leopold
von
schroeder
in
his
extremely
interesting
volume
mysterium
und
mimus
im
has
given
a
popular
and
practical
form
to
the
results
of
these
researches
by
translating
and
publishing
with
an
explanatory
study
a
selection
of
these
early
dramas
explaining
the
speeches
and
placing
them
in
the
mouth
of
the
respective
actors
to
whom
they
were
presumably
assigned
professor
von
schroeder
holds
the
entire
group
to
be
linked
together
by
one
common
intention
the
purpose
of
stimulating
the
processes
of
nature
and
of
obtaining
as
a
result
of
what
may
be
called
a
ritual
culture
drama
an
abundant
return
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
whole
book
is
rich
in
parallels
drawn
from
ancient
and
modern
sources
and
is
of
extraordinary
interest
to
the
student
in
the
light
thrown
by
professor
von
schroeder
researches
following
as
they
do
upon
the
illuminating
studies
of
mannhardt
and
frazer
we
become
strikingly
aware
of
the
curious
vitality
and
persistence
of
certain
popular
customs
and
beliefs
and
while
the
two
writers
have
rendered
inestimable
service
to
the
study
of
comparative
religion
by
linking
the
practices
of
classical
and
medieval
times
with
the
of
we
recognize
through
von
work
that
the
root
of
such
belief
and
custom
is
imbedded
in
a
deeper
stratum
of
than
we
had
hitherto
realized
that
it
is
in
fact
a
heritage
from
the
past
of
the
aryan
peoples
for
the
purposes
of
our
especial
line
of
research
mysterium
und
mimus
offers
much
of
value
and
interest
as
noted
above
the
main
object
of
these
primitive
dramas
was
that
of
encouraging
we
may
say
ensuring
the
fertility
of
the
earth
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
more
than
one
deals
with
the
theme
of
which
we
are
treating
the
freeing
of
the
waters
only
that
whereas
in
the
quotations
given
above
the
worshippers
praise
indra
for
his
beneficent
action
here
indra
himself
in
propria
persona
appears
and
vaunts
his
feat
ich
schlug
den
vritra

der
kraft
des
indra
durch

grimm
war
ich
so
stark

and
the
impersonated

speak
for
themselves
indra

er

einschloss
there
is
no
need
to
insist
further
on
the
point
that
the
task
of
the
grail
hero
is
in
this
special
respect
no
mere
literary
invention
but
a
heritage
from
the
achievements
of
the
prehistoric
heroes
of
the
aryan
race
but
the
poems
selected
by
professor
von
schroeder
for
discussion
offer
us
a
further
and
more
curious
parallel
with
the
grail
romances
in
section
viii
of
the
work
referred
to
the
author
discusses
the
story
of
rishyaçrińga
as
the
mahâbhârata
names
the
hero
here
we
find
a
young
brahmin
brought
up
by
his
father
vibhândaka
in
a
lonely
forest
hermitage
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
outside
world
and
even
of
the
very
existence
of
beings
other
than
his
father
and
himself
he
has
never
seen
a
woman
and
does
not
know
that
such
a
creature
exists
a
drought
falls
upon
a
neighbouring
kingdom
and
the
inhabitants
are
reduced
to
great
straits
for
lack
of
food
the
king
seeking
to
know
by
what
means
the
sufferings
of
his
people
may
be
relieved
learns
that
so
long
as
rishyaçrińga
continues
chaste
so
long
will
the
drought
endure
an
old
woman
who
has
a
fair
daughter
of
irregular
life
undertakes
the
seduction
of
the
hero
the
king
has
a
ship
or
raft
both
versions
are
given
fitted
out
with
all
possible
luxury
and
an
apparent
hermit
cell
erected
upon
it
the
old
woman
her
daughter
and
companions
embark
and
the
river
carries
them
to
a
point
not
far
from
the
young
brahmin
hermitage
taking
advantage
of
the
absence
of
his
father
the
girl
visits
rishyaçrińga
in
his
forest
cell
giving
him
to
understand
that
she
is
a
hermit
like
himself
which
the
boy
in
his
innocence
believes
he
is
so
fascinated
by
her
appearance
and
caresses
that
on
her
leaving
him
he
deep
in
thought
of
the
lovely
visitor
forgets
for
the
first
time
his
religious
duties
on
his
father
return
he
innocently
relates
what
has
happened
and
the
father
warns
him
that
fiends
in
this
fair
disguise
strive
to
tempt
hermits
to
their
undoing
the
next
time
the
father
is
absent
the
temptress
watching
her
opportunity
returns
and
persuades
the
boy
to
accompany
her
to
her
which
she
assures
him
is
far
more
beautiful
than
his
own
so
soon
as
rishyaçrińga
is
safely
on
board
the
ship
sails
the
lad
is
carried
to
the
capital
of
the
rainless
land
the
king
gives
him
his
daughter
as
wife
and
so
soon
as
the
marriage
is
consummated
the
spell
is
broken
and
rain
falls
in
abundance
professor
von
schroeder
points
out
that
there
is
little
doubt
that
in
certain
earlier
versions
of
the
tale
the
king
daughter
herself
played
the
rôle
of
temptress
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
ceremonial
very
frequently
formed
a
part
of
the
ritual
and
was
supposed
to
be
specially
efficacious
in
bringing
about
the
effect
desired
the
practice
subsists
in
indian
ritual
to
this
hour
and
the
surviving
traces
in
european
have
been
noted
in
full
by
mannhardt
in
his
exhaustive
work
on
wald
und
its
existence
in
classic
times
is
well
known
and
it
is
certainly
one
of
the
living
for
which
a
chain
of
descent
can
be
cited
professor
von
schroeder
remarks
that
the
efficacy
of
the
rite
appears
to
be
enhanced
by
the
previous
strict
observance
of
the
rule
of
chastity
by
the
officiant
what
however
is
of
more
immediate
interest
for
our
purpose
is
the
fact
that
the
rishyaçrińga
story
does
in
effect
possess
certain
curious
points
of
contact
with
the
grail
tradition
thus
the
lonely
upbringing
of
the
youth
in
a
forest
far
from
the
haunts
of
men
his
absolute
ignorance
of
the
existence
of
human
beings
other
than
his
parent
and
himself
present
a
close
parallel
to
the
accounts
of
perceval
youth
and
woodland
life
as
related
in
the
grail
romances
in
gerbert
continuation
we
are
told
that
the
marriage
of
the
hero
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
achieving
the
quest
a
detail
which
must
have
been
taken
over
from
an
earlier
version
as
gerbert
proceeds
to
stultify
himself
by
describing
the
solemnities
of
the
marriage
and
the
ceremonial
blessing
of
the
nuptial
couch
after
which
hero
and
heroine
simultaneously
agree
to
live
a
life
of
strict
chastity
and
are
rewarded
by
the
promise
that
the
swan
knight
shall
be
their
descendant
a
tissue
of
contradictions
which
can
only
be
explained
by
the
blending
of
two
versions
one
of
which
knew
the
hero
as
wedded
the
other
as
celibate
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
original
perceval
story
included
the
marriage
of
the
hero
the
circumstances
under
which
rishyaçrińga
is
lured
from
his
hermitage
are
curiously
paralleled
by
the
account
found
in
the
queste
and
manessier
of
perceval
temptation
by
a
fiend
in
the
form
of
a
fair
maiden
who
comes
to
him
by
water
in
a
vessel
hung
with
black
silk
and
with
great
riches
on
board
in
pointing
out
these
parallels
i
wish
to
make
my
position
perfectly
clear
i
do
not
claim
that
either
in
the
or
in
any
other
early
aryan
literary
monument
we
can
hope
to
discover
the
direct
sources
of
the
grail
legend
but
what
i
would
urge
upon
scholars
is
the
fact
that
in
adopting
the
hypothesis
of
a
nature
cult
as
a
possible
origin
and
examining
the
history
of
these
cults
their
evolution
and
their
variant
forms
we
do
in
effect
find
at
every
period
and
stage
of
development
undoubted
points
of
contact
which
though
taken
separately
might
be
regarded
as
accidental
in
their
ensemble
can
hardly
be
thus
considered
when
every
parallel
to
our
grail
story
is
found
within
the
circle
of
a
and
carefully
studied
sequence
of
belief
and
practice
when
each
and
all
form
part
of
a
body
of
tradition
the
descent
of
which
has
been
abundantly
demonstrated
then
i
submit
such
parallels
stand
on
a
sound
basis
and
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
the
body
of
tradition
containing
them
belongs
to
the
same
family
and
is
to
be
interpreted
on
the
same
principles
as
the
closely
analogous
rites
and
ceremonies
i
suspend
the
notice
and
discussion
of
other
poems
contained
in
von
schroeder
collection
till
we
have
reached
a
later
stage
of
the
tradition
when
their
correspondence
will
be
recognized
as
even
more
striking
and
suggestive
chapter
iv
tammuz
and
adonis
part
tammuz
in
the
previous
chapter
we
considered
certain
aspects
of
the
attitude
assumed
by
our
aryan
forefathers
towards
the
great
processes
of
nature
in
their
ordered
sequence
of
birth
growth
and
decay
we
saw
that
while
on
one
hand
they
by
prayer
and
supplication
threw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
divinity
who
in
their
belief
was
responsible
for
the
granting
or
withholding
of
the
water
whether
of
rain
or
river
the
constant
supply
of
which
was
an
essential
condition
of
such
ordered
sequence
they
on
the
other
hand
believed
that
by
their
own
actions
they
could
stimulate
and
assist
the
divine
activity
hence
the
dramatic
representations
to
which
i
have
referred
the
performance
for
instance
of
such
a
drama
as
the
rishyaçrińga
the
ceremonial
and
other
exercises
of
what
we
now
call
sympathetic
magic
to
quote
a
passage
from
sir
frazer
they
commonly
believed
that
the
tie
between
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
was
even
closer
than
it
really
is
to
them
the
principle
of
life
and
fertility
whether
animal
or
vegetable
was
one
and
indivisible
hence
actions
that
induced
fertility
in
the
animal
world
were
held
to
be
equally
efficacious
in
stimulating
the
reproductive
energies
of
the
vegetable
how
deeply
this
idea
was
rooted
in
the
minds
of
our
ancestors
we
their
descendants
may
learn
from
its
survival
to
our
own
day
the
ultimate
and
what
we
may
in
a
general
sense
term
the
classical
form
in
which
this
sense
of
the
community
of
the
life
principle
found
expression
was
that
which
endowed
the
vivifying
force
of
nature
with
a
distinct
personality
divine
or
whose
experiences
in
virtue
of
his
close
kinship
with
humanity
might
be
expressed
in
terms
of
ordinary
life
at
this
stage
the
progress
of
the
seasons
the
birth
of
vegetation
in
spring
or
its
revival
after
the
autumn
rains
its
glorious
fruition
in
early
summer
its
decline
and
death
under
the
maleficent
influence
either
of
the
scorching
sun
or
the
bitter
winter
cold
symbolically
represented
the
corresponding
stages
in
the
life
of
this
anthropomorphically
conceived
being
whose
annual
progress
from
birth
to
death
from
death
to
a
renewed
life
was
celebrated
with
a
solemn
ritual
of
corresponding
alternations
of
rejoicing
and
lamentation
recent
research
has
provided
us
with
abundant
material
for
the
study
of
the
varying
forms
of
this
nature
cult
the
extraordinary
importance
of
which
as
an
evolutionary
factor
in
what
we
may
term
the
concrete
expression
of
human
thought
and
feeling
is
only
gradually
becoming
realized
before
turning
our
attention
to
this
the
most
important
section
of
our
investigation
it
may
be
well
to
consider
one
characteristic
difference
between
the
nature
ritual
of
the
and
that
preserved
to
us
in
the
later
monuments
of
greek
antiquity
in
the
early
as
it
is
we
find
the
process
of
religious
evolution
already
far
advanced
the
god
has
separated
himself
from
his
worshippers
and
assumed
an
anthropomorphic
form
indra
while
still
retaining
traces
of
his
origin
is
no
longer
to
borrow
miss
harrison
descriptive
phrase
automatic
explosive
he
wields
the
thunderbolt
certainly
but
he
appears
in
heroic
form
to
receive
the
offerings
made
to
him
and
to
celebrate
his
victory
in
a
solemn
ritual
dance
in
greek
art
and
literature
on
the
other
hand
where
we
might
expect
to
find
an
even
more
advanced
conception
we
are
faced
with
one
seemingly
more
primitive
and
inchoate
the
idea
of
a
constantly
recurring
cycle
of
birth
death
and
resurrection
or
of
all
things
in
nature
this
cycle
depending
upon
the
activities
of
an
entity
at
first
vaguely
conceived
of
as
the
of
the
year
the
eniautos
daimon
this
being
at
one
stage
of
evolution
theriomorphic
he
might
assume
the
form
of
a
bull
a
goat
or
a
snake
the
latter
probably
from
the
close
connection
of
the
reptile
with
the
earth
being
the
more
general
form
only
gradually
and
by
distinctly
traceable
stages
assumed
an
anthropomorphic
shape
this
gives
to
the
study
of
greek
antiquity
a
special
and
peculiar
value
since
in
regard
to
the
body
of
religious
belief
and
observance
with
which
we
are
here
immediately
concerned
neither
in
what
we
may
not
improperly
term
its
ultimate
early
aryan
nor
in
what
has
been
generally
considered
its
proximate
source
have
these
intermediate
stages
been
preserved
in
each
case
the
ritual
remains
are
illustrative
of
a
highly
developed
cult
distinctly
anthropomorphic
in
conception
i
offer
no
opinion
as
to
the
critical
significance
of
this
fact
but
i
would
draw
the
attention
of
scholars
to
its
existence
that
the
process
of
evolution
was
complete
at
a
very
early
date
has
been
proved
by
recent
researches
into
the
civilization
we
know
now
that
the
cult
of
the
god
tammuz
who
if
not
the
direct
original
of
the
adonis
is
at
least
representative
of
a
common
parent
deity
may
be
traced
back
to
while
it
persisted
among
the
sabeans
at
harran
into
the
middle
ages
while
much
relating
to
the
god
and
his
precise
position
in
the
pantheon
still
remains
obscure
fragmentary
cuneiform
texts
connected
with
the
religious
services
of
the
period
have
been
discovered
and
to
a
considerable
extent
deciphered
and
we
are
thus
in
a
position
to
judge
from
the
prayers
and
invocations
addressed
to
the
deity
what
were
the
powers
attributed
to
and
the
benefits
besought
from
him
these
texts
are
of
a
uniform
character
they
are
all
or
having
for
their
exciting
cause
the
disappearance
of
tammuz
from
this
upper
earth
and
the
disastrous
effects
produced
upon
animal
and
vegetable
life
by
his
absence
the
woes
of
the
land
and
the
folk
are
set
forth
in
poignant
detail
and
tammuz
is
passionately
invoked
to
have
pity
upon
his
worshippers
and
to
end
their
sufferings
by
a
speedy
return
this
return
we
find
from
other
texts
was
effected
by
the
action
of
a
goddess
the
mother
sister
or
paramour
of
tammuz
who
descending
into
the
nether
world
induced
the
youthful
deity
to
return
with
her
to
earth
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
texts
which
have
been
deciphered
that
tammuz
is
not
to
be
regarded
merely
as
representing
the
spirit
of
vegetation
his
influence
is
operative
not
only
in
the
vernal
processes
of
nature
as
a
spring
god
but
in
all
its
reproductive
energies
without
distinction
or
limitation
he
may
be
considered
as
an
embodiment
of
the
life
principle
and
his
cult
as
a
life
cult
mr
stephen
langdon
inclines
to
believe
that
the
original
tammuz
typified
the
vivifying
waters
he
writes
since
in
babylonia
as
in
egypt
the
fertility
of
the
soil
depended
upon
irrigation
it
is
but
natural
to
expect
that
the
youthful
god
who
represents
the
birth
and
death
of
nature
would
represent
the
beneficent
waters
which
flooded
the
valleys
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
in
the
late
winter
and
which
ebbed
away
and
nearly
disappeared
in
the
canals
and
rivers
in
the
period
of
summer
drought
we
find
therefore
that
the
theologians
regarded
this
youthful
divinity
as
belonging
to
the
cult
of
eridu
centre
of
the
worship
of
ea
lord
of
the
nether
sea
in
a
note
to
this
passage
mr
langdon
adds
he
appears
in
the
great
theological
list
as
of
the
nether
sea
faithful
son
of
the
fresh
waters
which
come
from
the
earth
this
presents
us
with
an
interesting
analogy
to
the
citations
given
in
the
previous
chapter
from
the
the
tammuz
cult
is
specially
valuable
as
providing
us
with
evidence
of
the
gradual
evolution
of
the
life
cult
from
the
early
conception
of
the
vivifying
power
of
the
waters
to
the
wider
recognition
of
a
common
principle
underlying
all
manifestations
of
life
this
is
very
clearly
brought
out
in
the
beautiful
lament
for
tammuz
published
by
mr
langdon
in
tammuz
and
ishtar
and
also
in
sumerian
and
babylonian
psalms
in
eanna
high
and
low
there
is
weeping
wailing
for
the
house
of
the
lord
they
raise
the
wailing
is
for
the
plants
the
first
lament
is
grow
not
the
wailing
is
for
the
barley
the
ears
grow
not
for
the
habitations
and
flocks
it
is
they
produce
not
for
the
perishing
wedded
ones
for
perishing
children
it
is
the
people
create
not
the
wailing
is
for
the
great
river
it
brings
the
flood
no
more
the
wailing
is
for
the
fields
of
men
the
gunu
grows
no
more
the
wailing
is
for
the
the
dasuhur

not
the

the
the

the
wailing

bounty
of

the
sihtu
plants
grow
not
the
wailing
is
for
the
palace
life
unto
distant
days
is
not
can
anything
be
more
expressive
of
the
community
of
life
animating
the
whole
of
nature
than
this
poignantly
worded
lament
a
point
which
differentiates
the
worship
of
tammuz
from
the
kindred
and
better
known
cult
of
adonis
is
the
fact
that
we
have
no
liturgical
record
of
the
celebration
of
the
resurrection
of
the
deity
it
certainly
took
place
for
the
effects
are
referred
to
where
grass
was
not
there
grass
is
eaten
where
water
was
not
water
is
drunk
where
the
cattle
sheds
were
not
cattle
sheds
are
built
while
this
distinctly
implies
the
revival
of
vegetable
and
animal
life
those
features
resurrection
and
sacred
marriage
which
made
the
adonis
ritual
one
of
rejoicing
as
much
as
of
lamentation
are
absent
from
liturgical
remains
of
the
tammuz
cult
a
detail
which
has
attracted
the
attention
of
scholars
is
the
lack
of
any
artistic
representation
of
this
ritual
a
lack
which
is
the
more
striking
in
view
of
the
important
position
which
these
for
tammuz
occupy
in
the
extant
remains
of
babylonian
liturgies
on
this
point
mr
langdon
makes
an
interesting
suggestion
it
is
probable
that
the
service
of
wailing
for
the
dying
god
the
descent
of
the
mother
and
the
resurrection
were
attended
by
mysterious
rituals
the
actual
mysteries
may
have
been
performed
in
a
secret
chamber
and
consequently
the
scenes
were
forbidden
in
art
this
would
account
for
the
surprising
dearth
of
archaeological
evidence
concerning
a
cult
upon
which
the
very
life
of
mankind
was
supposed
to
depend
in
view
of
the
fact
that
my
suggestion
as
to
the
possible
later
development
of
these
life
cults
as
mysteries
has
aroused
considerable
opposition
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
such
development
is
held
by
those
best
acquainted
with
the
earliest
forms
of
the
ritual
to
have
been
not
merely
possible
but
to
have
actually
taken
place
and
that
at
a
very
remote
date
mr
langdon
quotes
a
passage
referring
to
kings
who
in
their
day
played
the
rôle
of
tammuz
in
the
mystery
of
this
cult
he
considers
that
here
we
have
to
do
with
kings
who
by
a
symbolic
act
escaped
the
final
penalty
of
sacrifice
as
representative
of
the
dying
god
the
full
importance
of
the
evidence
above
set
forth
will
become
more
clearly
apparent
as
we
proceed
with
our
investigation
here
i
would
simply
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
now
possess
definite
proof
that
at
a
period
of
some
years
the
idea
of
a
being
upon
whose
life
and
reproductive
activities
the
very
existence
of
nature
and
its
corresponding
energies
was
held
to
depend
yet
who
was
himself
subject
to
the
vicissitudes
of
declining
powers
and
death
like
an
ordinary
mortal
had
already
assumed
a
fixed
and
practically
final
form
further
that
this
form
was
specially
crystallized
in
ritual
observances
in
our
study
of
the
later
manifestations
of
this
cult
we
shall
find
that
this
central
idea
is
always
and
unalterably
the
same
and
is
moreover
frequently
accompanied
by
a
remarkable
correspondence
of
detail
the
chain
of
evidence
is
already
strong
and
we
may
justly
claim
that
the
links
added
by
further
research
strengthen
while
they
lengthen
that
chain
part
ii
adonis
while
it
is
only
of
comparatively
recent
date
that
information
as
to
the
exact
character
of
the
worship
directed
to
tammuz
has
been
available
and
the
material
we
at
present
possess
is
but
fragmentary
in
character
the
corresponding
cult
of
the
divinity
we
know
as
adonis
has
for
some
years
been
the
subject
of
scholarly
research
not
only
have
the
details
of
the
ritual
been
examined
and
discussed
and
the
surviving
artistic
evidence
described
and
illustrated
but
from
the
anthropological
side
attention
has
been
forcibly
directed
to
its
importance
as
a
factor
in
the
elucidation
of
certain
widespread
and
practices
we
know
now
that
the
worship
of
adonis
which
enjoyed
among
the
greeks
a
popularity
extending
to
our
own
day
was
originally
of
phoenician
origin
its
principal
centres
being
the
cities
of
byblos
and
aphaka
from
phoenicia
it
spread
to
the
greek
islands
the
earliest
evidence
of
the
worship
being
found
in
cyprus
and
from
thence
to
the
mainland
where
it
established
itself
firmly
the
records
of
the
cult
go
back
to
but
it
may
quite
possibly
be
of
much
earlier
date
mr
langdon
suggests
that
the
worship
of
the
divinity
we
know
as
adonis
may
under
another
name
reach
back
to
an
antiquity
equal
with
that
we
can
now
ascribe
to
the
cult
of
tammuz
in
its
fully
evolved
classical
form
the
cult
of
adonis
offers
as
it
were
a
halfway
house
between
the
fragmentary
relics
of
aryan
and
babylonian
antiquity
and
the
wealth
of
medieval
and
modern
survivals
to
which
the
ingenuity
and
patience
of
contemporary
scholars
have
directed
our
attention
we
all
know
the
mythological
tale
popularly
attached
to
the
name
of
adonis
that
he
was
a
fair
youth
beloved
of
aphrodite
who
wounded
in
the
thigh
by
a
wild
boar
died
of
his
wound
the
goddess
in
despair
at
his
death
by
her
prayers
won
from
zeus
the
boon
that
adonis
be
allowed
to
return
to
earth
for
a
portion
of
each
year
and
henceforward
the
youthful
god
divides
his
time
between
the
goddess
of
hades
persephone
and
aphrodite
but
the
importance
assumed
by
the
story
the
elaborate
ceremonial
with
which
the
death
of
adonis
was
mourned
and
his
restoration
to
life
fęted
the
date
and
character
of
the
celebrations
all
leave
no
doubt
that
the
personage
with
whom
we
are
dealing
was
no
mere
favourite
of
a
goddess
but
one
with
whose
life
and
the
ordinary
processes
of
nature
whether
animal
or
vegetable
were
closely
and
intimately
concerned
in
fact
the
central
figure
of
these
rites
by
whatever
name
he
may
be
called
is
the
somewhat
elusive
and
impersonal
entity
who
represents
in
anthropomorphic
form
the
principle
of
animate
nature
upon
whose
preservation
and
unimpaired
energies
the
life
of
man
directly
and
indirectly
depends
before
proceeding
to
examine
these
rites
there
is
one
point
to
which
i
have
alluded
earlier
in
another
connection
upon
which
our
minds
must
be
quite
clear
the
nature
of
the
injury
suffered
writers
upon
the
subject
are
of
one
accord
in
considering
the
usual
account
to
be
but
a
euphemistic
veiling
of
the
truth
while
the
close
relation
between
the
stories
of
adonis
and
attis
and
the
practices
associated
with
the
cult
place
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
the
fact
that
the
true
reason
for
this
universal
mourning
was
the
cessation
or
suspension
by
injury
or
death
of
the
reproductive
energy
of
the
god
upon
whose
virile
activity
vegetable
life
directly
and
human
life
indirectly
depended
what
we
have
need
to
seize
and
to
insist
upon
is
the
overpowering
influence
which
the
sense
of
life
the
need
for
life
the
essential
sanctity
of
the
faculty
exercised
upon
primitive
religions
vellay
puts
this
well
when
he
says
en

sur
la
conception
de
la
vie

dans
son

et
dans
son
action
et
dans

says
even
more
precisely
and
emphatically
in

den

and
in
spite
of
the
strong
opposition
to
this
cult
manifested
in
indian
literature
beginning
with
the
and
ripening
to
fruition
in
the
upanishads
in
spite
of
the
rise
of
buddhism
with
its
opposing
dictum
of
renunciation
the
asserted
its
essential
vitality
against
all
opposition
and
under
modified
forms
represents
the
religion
of
india
to
this
day
each
and
all
of
the
ritual
dramas
reconstructed
in
the
pages
of
mysterium
und
mimus
bear
more
or
less
distinctly
the
stamp
of
their
origin
while
outside
india
the
pages
of
frazer
and
mannhardt
and
numerous
other
writers
on
and
ethnology
record
the
widespread
and
persistent
survival
of
these
rites
and
their
successful
defiance
of
the
spread
of
civilization
it
is
to
this
special
group
of
belief
and
practice
that
the
adonis
and
more
especially
its
phrygian
counterpart
the
attis
worship
belong
and
even
when
transplanted
to
the
more
restrained
and
cultured
environment
of
the
greek
mainland
they
still
retained
their
primitive
character
farnell
in
his
cults
of
the
greek
states
refers
to
the
worship
of
adonis
as
a
ritual
that
the
more
austere
state
religion
of
greece
probably
failed
to
purify
the
saner
minds
bred
in
a
religious
atmosphere
that
was
on
the
whole
genial
and
temperate
revolted
from
the
din
of
cymbals
and
drums
the
meaningless
ecstasies
of
sorrow
and
joy
that
marked
the
new
religion
it
is
i
submit
indispensable
for
the
purposes
of
our
investigation
that
the
essential
character
and
significance
of
the
cults
with
which
we
are
dealing
should
not
be
evaded
or
ignored
but
faced
frankly
admitted
and
held
in
mind
during
the
progress
of
our
enquiry
having
now
determined
the
general
character
of
the
ritual
what
were
the
specific
details
the
date
of
the
feast
seems
to
have
varied
in
different
countries
thus
in
greece
it
was
celebrated
in
the
spring
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
vegetation
according
to
saint
jerome
in
palestine
the
celebration
fell
in
june
when
plant
life
was
in
its
first
full
luxuriance
in
cyprus
at
the
autumnal
equinox
the
beginning
of
the
year
in
the
calendar
the
death
of
adonis
falling
on
the
of
september
his
resurrection
on
the
of
october
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
here
adonis
was
considered
as
vellay
suggests
less
as
the
god
of
vegetation
than
as
the
superior
and
nameless
lord
of
life
adôn
lord
under
whose
protection
the
year
was
placed
he
is
the
eniautos
daimon
in
the
same
way
as
the
dates
varied
so
also
did
the
order
of
the
ritual
generally
speaking
the
elaborate
ceremonies
of
mourning
for
the
dead
god
and
committing
his
effigy
to
the
waves
preceded
the
joyous
celebration
of
his
resurrection
but
in
alexandria
the
sequence
was
otherwise
the
feast
began
with
the
solemn
and
joyous
celebration
of
the
nuptials
of
adonis
and
aphrodite
at
the
conclusion
of
which
a
head
of
papyrus
representing
the
god
was
with
every
show
of
mourning
committed
to
the
waves
and
borne
within
seven
days
by
a
current
always
to
be
counted
upon
at
that
season
of
the
year
to
byblos
where
it
was
received
and
welcomed
with
popular
rejoicing
the
duration
of
the
feast
varied
from
two
days
as
at
alexandria
to
seven
or
eight
connected
with
the
longer
period
of
the
feast
were
the
of
adonis
baskets
or
pans
planted
with
quick
growing
seeds
which
speedily
come
to
fruition
and
as
speedily
wither
in
the
modern
survivals
of
the
cult
three
days
form
the
general
term
for
the
flowering
of
these
gardens
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
the
ritual
was
the
prominence
assigned
to
women
ce
sont
les
femmes
qui
le
pleurent
et
qui
ŕ
sa
tombe
elles
sanglotent
éperdument
pendant
les
nuits
leur
dieu
plus
que
tout
autre
et
seules
elles
veulent
pleurer
sa
mort
et
chanter
sa
résurrection
thus
in
the
tenth
century
the
festival
received
the
arabic
name
of
or
festival
of
the
weeping
women
one
very
curious
practice
during
these
celebrations
was
that
of
cutting
off
the
hair
in
honour
of
the
god
women
who
hesitated
to
make
this
sacrifice
must
offer
themselves
to
strangers
either
in
the
temple
or
on
the
the
gold
received
as
the
price
of
their
favours
being
offered
to
the
goddess
this
obligation
only
lasted
for
one
day
it
was
also
customary
for
the
priests
of
adonis
to
mutilate
themselves
in
imitation
of
the
god
a
distinct
proof
if
one
were
needed
of
the
traditional
cause
of
his
death
turning
from
a
consideration
of
the
adonis
ritual
its
details
and
significance
to
an
examination
of
the
grail
romances
we
find
that
their
provides
a
striking
series
of
parallels
with
the
classical
celebrations
parallels
which
instead
of
vanishing
as
parallels
have
occasionally
an
awkward
habit
of
doing
before
closer
investigation
rather
gain
in
force
the
more
closely
they
are
studied
thus
the
central
figure
is
either
a
dead
knight
on
a
bier
as
in
the
gawain
versions
or
a
wounded
king
on
a
litter
when
wounded
the
injury
corresponds
with
that
suffered
by
adonis
and
attis
closely
connected
with
the
wounding
of
the
king
is
the
destruction
which
has
fallen
on
the
land
which
will
be
removed
when
the
king
is
healed
the
version
of
sone
de
nansai
is
here
of
extreme
interest
the
position
is
stated
with
so
much
clearness
and
precision
that
the
conclusion
can
not
be
evaded
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
dreaded
calamity
which
it
was
the
aim
of
the
adonis
ritual
to
avert
the
temporary
suspension
of
all
the
reproductive
energies
of
nature
while
the
condition
of
the
king
is
the
cause
of
general
and
vociferous
lamentation
a
special
feature
never
satisfactorily
accounted
for
is
the
presence
of
a
weeping
woman
or
several
weeping
women
thus
in
the
interpolated
visit
of
gawain
to
the
grail
castle
found
in
the
c
group
of
perceval
the
weeps
piteously
as
she
does
also
in
diű
crône
in
the
version
of
the
prose
lancelot
gawain
during
the
night
sees
twelve
maidens
come
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
where
the
grail
is
kept
kneel
down
and
weep
bitterly
in
fact
behave
precisely
as
did
the
classical
mourners
for
adonis
elles
sanglotent
éperdument
pendant
la
nuit
behaviour
for
which
the
text
as
it
now
stands
provides
no
shadow
of
explanation
or
excuse
the
grail
is
here
the
most
revered
of
christian
relics
the
dwellers
in
the
castle
of
corbenic
have
all
that
heart
can
desire
with
the
additional
prestige
of
being
the
guardians
of
the
grail
if
the
feature
be
not
a
belated
survival
which
has
lost
its
meaning
it
defies
any
explanation
whatsoever
in
diű
crône
alone
where
the
and
her
maidens
are
the
sole
living
beings
in
an
abode
of
the
dead
is
any
explanation
of
the
women
attempted
but
an
interpolated
passage
in
the
college
of
the
perceval
states
that
when
the
quest
is
achieved
the
hero
shall
learn
the
cause
of
the
maiden
grief
and
also
the
explanation
of
the
dead
knight
upon
the
bier
del

onques
pur
nule
rien
qui
avenist
fo
of
course
in
the
perceval
there
is
neither
a
weeping
maiden
nor
a
bier
and
the
passage
must
therefore
be
either
an
unintelligent
addition
by
a
scribe
familiar
with
the
gawain
versions
or
an
interpolation
from
a
source
which
did
contain
the
features
in
question
so
far
as
the
texts
at
our
disposal
are
concerned
both
features
belong
exclusively
to
the
gawain
and
not
to
the
perceval
quest
the
interpolation
is
significant
as
it
indicates
a
surviving
sense
of
the
importance
of
this
feature
in
the
perlesvaus
we
have
the
curious
detail
of
a
maiden
who
has
lost
her
hair
as
a
result
of
the
hero
failure
to
ask
the
question
and
the
consequent
sickness
of
the
fisher
king
the
occurrence
of
this
detail
may
be
purely
fortuitous
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
admissible
to
point
out
that
the
adonis
cults
do
provide
us
with
a
parallel
in
the
enforced
loss
of
hair
by
the
women
taking
part
in
these
rites
while
no
explanation
of
this
curious
feature
has
so
far
as
i
am
aware
been
suggested
by
critics
of
the
text
we
may
also
note
the
fact
that
the
grail
castle
is
always
situated
in
the
close
vicinity
of
water
either
on
or
near
the
sea
or
on
the
banks
of
an
important
river
in
two
cases
the
final
home
of
the
grail
is
in
a
monastery
situated
upon
an
island
the
presence
of
water
either
sea
or
river
is
an
important
feature
in
the
adonis
cult
the
effigy
of
the
dead
god
being
not
buried
in
the
earth
but
thrown
into
the
water
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
in
suggesting
a
form
of
nature
worship
analogous
to
this
cult
as
the
possible
ultimate
source
from
which
the
incidents
and
of
the
grail
stories
were
derived
we
are
relying
not
upon
an
isolated
parallel
but
upon
a
group
of
parallels
which
alike
in
incident
and
intention
offer
not
merely
a
resemblance
to
but
also
an
explanation
of
the
perplexing
problems
of
the
grail
literature
we
must
now
consider
the
question
whether
incidents
so
remote
in
time
may
fairly
and
justly
be
utilized
in
this
manner
chapter
v
medieval
and
modern
forms
of
nature
ritual
readers
of
the
foregoing
pages
may
not
improbably
object
that
while
we
have
instanced
certain
curious
and
isolated
parallels
from
early
aryan
literature
and
tradition
and
what
from
the
point
of
view
of
declared
intention
appears
to
be
a
kindred
group
of
religious
belief
and
practice
in
and
classical
times
the
two
so
far
show
no
direct
signs
of
affiliation
while
both
may
be
held
to
be
far
removed
in
point
of
date
alike
from
one
another
and
from
the
romantic
literature
of
the
twelfth
century
this
objection
is
sound
in
itself
but
if
we
can
show
by
modern
parallels
that
the
ideas
which
took
form
and
shape
in
early
aryan
drama
and
babylonian
and
classic
ritual
not
only
survive
to
our
day
but
are
found
in
combination
with
features
corresponding
minutely
with
details
recorded
in
early
aryan
literature
we
may
hold
the
gulf
to
be
bridged
and
the
common
origin
and
close
relationship
of
the
different
stages
to
be
an
ascertained
fact
at
the
outset
and
before
examining
the
evidence
collected
by
scholars
i
would
remind
my
readers
that
the
modern
greeks
have
retained
in
many
instances
under
changed
names
no
inconsiderable
portion
of
their
ancient
mythological
beliefs
among
them
the
celebrations
the
of
blossom
and
fade
as
they
did
many
centuries
ago
and
i
have
myself
spoken
with
a
scholar
who
has
seen
at
the
door
of
their
houses
weeping
for
adonis
for
evidence
of
the
widespread
character
of
medieval
and
modern
survivals
we
have
only
to
consult
the
works
of
mannhardt
wald
und
and
frazer
the
golden
bough
in
the
pages
of
these
volumes
we
shall
find
more
than
sufficient
for
our
purpose
from
the
wealth
of
illustration
with
which
these
works
abound
i
have
selected
merely
such
instances
as
seem
to
apply
more
directly
to
the
subject
of
our
investigation
thus
in
many
places
it
is
still
the
custom
to
carry
a
figure
representing
the
vegetation
spirit
on
a
bier
attended
by
mourning
women
and
either
bury
the
figure
throw
it
into
water
as
a
rain
charm
or
after
a
mock
death
carry
the
revivified
deity
with
rejoicing
back
to
the
town
thus
in
the
lechrain
a
man
in
black
women
clothes
is
borne
on
a
bier
followed
by
men
dressed
as
professional
women
mourners
making
lamentation
thrown
on
the
village
drenched
with
water
and
buried
in
straw
in
russia
the
vegetation
or
year
spirit
is
known
as
yarilo
and
is
represented
by
a
doll
with
phallic
attributes
which
is
enclosed
in
a
coffin
and
carried
through
the
streets
to
the
accompaniment
of
lamentation
by
women
whose
emotions
have
been
excited
by
drink
mannhardt
gives
the
lament
as
follows
wessen
war
er
schuldig
er
war
so
gut
er

in
other
forms
of
the
ritual
we
find
distinct
traces
of
the
resuscitation
of
the
vegetation
deity
occasionally
accompanied
by
evidence
of
rejuvenation
thus
in
lausitz
on
laetare

the
sunday
in
lent
women
with
mourning
veils
carry
a
straw
figure
dressed
in
a
man
shirt
to
the
bounds
of
the
next
village
where
they
tear
the
effigy
to
pieces
hang
the
shirt
on
a
young
and
flourishing
tree
schöne
which
they
proceed
to
cut
down
and
carry
home
with
every
sign
of
rejoicing
here
evidently
the
young
tree
is
regarded
as
a
rejuvenation
of
the
person
represented
in
the
first
instance
by
the
straw
figure
in
many
parts
of
europe
the
corresponding
ceremonies
very
generally
held
at
whitsuntide
include
the
mock
execution
of
the
individual
representing
the
vegetation
spirit
frequently
known
as
the
king
of
the
may
in
bohemia
the
person
playing
the
rôle
of
the
king
is
with
his
attendants
dressed
in
bark
and
decked
with
garlands
of
flowers
at
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremonies
the
king
is
allowed
a
short
start
and
is
then
pursued
by
the
armed
attendants
if
he
is
not
overtaken
he
holds
office
for
a
year
but
if
overtaken
he
suffers
a
mock
decapitation
or
crown
being
struck
off
and
the
pretended
corpse
is
then
borne
on
a
bier
to
the
next
village
mannhardt
discussing
this
point
remarks
that
in
the
mock
execution
we
must
recognize
ein

he
enumerates
the
various
modes
of
death
shooting
stabbing
in
the
latter
case
a
bladder
filled
with
blood
and
concealed
under
the
clothes
is
pierced
in
bohemia
decapitation
occasionally
drowning
which
primarily
represents
a
rain
charm
is
the
form
adopted
he
then
goes
on
to
remark
that
this
ceremonial
death
must
have
been
generally
followed
by
resuscitation
as
in
thuringia
where
the
man
as
the
central
figure
is
there
named
is
brought
to
life
again
by
the
doctor
while
the
survival
in
the
more
elaborate
spring
processions
of
this
latter
character
even
where
he
plays
no
special
rôle
points
to
the
fact
that
his
part
in
the
proceedings
was
originally
a
more
important
one
that
mannhardt
was
not
mistaken
is
proved
by
the
evidence
of
the
kindred
dances
a
subject
we
shall
consider
later
there
we
shall
find
the
doctor
playing
his
rôle
and
restoring
to
life
the
slain
representative
of
the
vegetation
spirit
the
character
of
the
doctor
or
medicine
man
formed
as
i
believe
at
one
time
no
unimportant
link
in
the
chain
which
connects
these
practices
with
the
grail
tradition
the
signification
of
the
resuscitation
ceremony
is
obscured
in
cases
where
the
same
figure
undergoes
death
and
revival
without
any
corresponding
change
of
form
this
point
did
not
escape
acute
critical
eye
he
remarks
that
in
cases
where
in
swabia
the
is
described
as
ein
armer

who
has
lived
seven
years
in
the
woods
the
seven
winter
months
a
scene
of
rejuvenation
should
follow
diese
scheint
meistenteils
verloren

doch
vielleicht
scheint
es
nur
so
he
goes
on
to
draw
attention
to
the
practice
in
reideberg
bei
halle
where
after
burying
a
straw
figure
called
the
old
man
the
villagers
dance
round
the
and
he
suggests
that
the
man
represents
the
defunct
vegetation
spirit
the
may
tree
that
spirit
resuscitated
and
refers
in
this
connection
to
the
durchaus
verwandten
asiatischen
gebrauchen
des
attis
und
the
foregoing
evidence
offers
i
think
sufficient
proof
of
the
now
generally
admitted
relationship
between
classical
medieval
and
modern
forms
of
nature
ritual
but
what
of
the
relation
to
early
aryan
practice
can
that
also
be
proved
in
this
connection
i
would
draw
attention
to
chapter
of
mysterium
und
mimus
entitled
ein
volkstümlicher
umzug
beim
here
professor
von
schroeder
discusses
the
real
meaning
and
significance
of
a
very
curious
little
poem
the
title
by
which
it
is
generally
known
alles
lauft
nach
geld
does
not
at
first
sight
fit
the
content
of
the
verse
and
the
suggestion
of
scholars
who
have
seen
in
it
a
humorous
enumeration
of
different
trades
and
handicrafts
does
not
explain
the
fact
that
the
frog
and
the
horse
appear
in
it
to
professor
von
schroeder
belongs
the
credit
of
having
discovered
that
the
personnel
of
the
poem
corresponds
with
extraordinary
exactitude
to
the
figures
of
the
spring
and
summer
processions
described
with
such
fulness
of
detail
by
mannhardt
especially
is
this
the
case
with
the
whitsuntide
procession
at
värdegötzen
in
hanover
where
we
find
the
group
of
phallic
and
fertility
demons
who
on
von
schroeder
hypothesis
figure
in
the
song
in
concrete
and
actual
form
the
vegetation
spirit
appears
in
the
song
as
an
old
man
while
his
female
counterpart
an
old
woman
is
described
as
the
von
schroeder
points
out
that
in
some
parts
of
russia
the
as
the
corn
mother
is
called
is
an
old
woman
who
flies
through
the
air
in
a
the
doctor
to
whom
we
have
referred
above
is
mentioned
twice
in
the
four
verses
composing
the
song
he
was
evidently
regarded
as
an
important
figure
while
the
whole
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
evidently
the
spokesman
of
the
party
who
proclaims
their
object
verschiednes

gifts
in

and

as
such
folk
processions
do
the
whole
study
is
of
extraordinary
interest
for
students
and
so
far
as
our
especial
investigation
is
concerned
it
seems
to
me
to
supply
the
necessary
proof
of
the
identity
and
persistence
of
aryan
and
tradition
a
very
important
modification
of
the
root
idea
and
one
which
appears
to
have
a
direct
bearing
on
the
sources
of
the
grail
tradition
was
that
by
which
among
certain
peoples
the
rôle
of
the
god
his
responsibility
for
providing
the
requisite
rain
upon
which
the
fertility
of
the
land
and
the
life
of
the
folk
depended
was
combined
with
that
of
the
king
this
was
the
case
among
the
celts
mcculloch
in
the
religion
of
the
celts
discussing
the
question
of
the
early
irish
geasa
or
taboo
explains
the
geasa
of
the
irish
kings
as
designed
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
tribe
the
making
of
rain
and
sunshine
on
which
their
prosperity
depended
their
observance
made
the
earth
fruitful
produced
abundance
and
prosperity
and
kept
both
the
king
and
his
land
from
misfortune
the
kings
were
divinities
on
whom
depended
fruitfulness
and
plenty
and
who
must
therefore
submit
to
obey
their
the
same
idea
seems
to
have
prevailed
in
early
greece
mr
a
cook
in
his
studies
on
the
european
remarks
that
the
king
in
early
greece
was
regarded
as
the
representative
of
zeus
his
duties
could
be
satisfactorily
discharged
only
by
a
man
who
was
perfect
and
without
blemish
by
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
suffering
from
no
defect
of
body
or
mind
he
quotes
in
illustration
the
speech
of
odysseus
od
as
a
king
without
blemish
who
ruleth
over
many
mighty
men
and
maintaineth
justice
while
the
black
earth
beareth
wheat
and
barley
and
the
trees
are
laden
with
fruit
and
the
flocks
bring
forth
without
fail
and
the
sea
yieldeth
fish
by
reason
of
his
good
rule
and
the
folk
prosper
beneath
him
the
king
who
is
without
blemish
has
a
flourishing
kingdom
the
king
who
is
maimed
has
a
kingdom
diseased
like
himself
thus
the
spartans
were
warned
by
an
oracle
to
beware
of
a
reign
a
most
remarkable
modern
survival
of
this
idea
is
recorded
by
dr
frazer
in
the
latest
edition
of
the
golden
bough
and
is
so
complete
and
suggestive
that
i
make
no
apology
for
transcribing
it
at
some
length
the
shilluk
an
african
tribe
inhabit
the
banks
of
the
white
nile
their
territory
extending
on
the
west
bank
from
kaka
in
the
north
to
lake
no
in
the
south
on
the
east
bank
from
fashoda
to
taufikia
and
some
miles
up
the
sohat
river
numbering
some
in
all
they
are
a
pastoral
people
their
wealth
consisting
in
flocks
and
herds
grain
and
millet
the
king
resides
at
fashoda
and
is
regarded
with
extreme
reverence
as
being
a
of
nyakang
the
hero
who
settled
the
tribe
in
their
present
territory
nyakang
is
the
on
whom
their
life
and
prosperity
depend
there
are
several
shrines
in
which
sacred
spears
now
kept
for
sacrificial
purposes
are
preserved
the
originals
which
were
the
property
of
nyakang
having
disappeared
the
king
though
regarded
with
reverence
must
not
be
allowed
to
become
old
or
feeble
lest
with
the
diminishing
vigour
of
the
ruler
the
cattle
should
sicken
and
fail
to
bear
increase
the
crops
should
rot
in
the
field
and
men
die
in
ever
growing
numbers
one
of
the
signs
of
failing
energy
is
the
king
inability
to
fulfil
the
desires
of
his
wives
of
whom
he
has
a
large
number
when
this
occurs
the
wives
report
the
fact
to
the
chiefs
who
condemn
the
king
to
death
forthwith
communicating
the
sentence
to
him
by
spreading
a
white
cloth
over
his
face
and
knees
during
his
slumber
formerly
the
king
was
starved
to
death
in
a
hut
in
company
with
a
young
maiden
but
in
consequence
it
is
said
of
the
great
vitality
and
protracted
suffering
of
one
king
this
is
no
longer
done
the
precise
manner
of
death
is
difficult
to
ascertain
dr
seligmann
who
was
sir
frazer
authority
thinks
that
he
is
now
strangled
in
a
hut
especially
erected
for
that
purpose
at
one
time
he
might
be
attacked
and
slain
by
a
rival
either
of
his
own
family
or
of
that
of
one
of
the
previous
kings
of
whom
there
are
many
but
this
has
long
been
superseded
by
the
ceremonial
slaying
of
the
monarch
who
after
his
death
is
revered
as
nyakang
this
survival
is
of
extraordinary
interest
it
presents
us
with
a
curiously
close
parallel
to
the
situation
which
on
the
evidence
of
the
texts
we
have
postulated
as
forming
the
basic
idea
of
the
grail
tradition
the
position
of
a
people
whose
prosperity
and
the
fertility
of
their
land
are
closely
bound
up
with
the
life
and
virility
of
their
king
who
is
not
a
mere
man
but
a
divine
if
he
into
languishment
as
does
the
fisher
king
in
perlesvaus
the
land
and
its
inhabitants
will
suffer
correspondingly
not
only
will
the
country
suffer
from
drought
nus
prčs
raverdia
but
the
men
will
die
in
numbers
dames
en

we
may
say
the
cattle
will
cease
to
bear
increase
ne

and
the
people
take
drastic
steps
to
bring
about
a
rejuvenation
the
old
king
dies
to
be
replaced
by
a
young
and
vigorous
successor
even
as
brons
was
replaced
by
perceval
let
us
now
turn
back
to
the
preceding
chapter
and
compare
the
position
of
the
people
of
the
shilluk
tribe
and
the
subjects
of
the
grail
king
with
that
of
the
ancient
babylonians
as
set
forth
in
their
lamentations
for
tammuz
there
we
find
that
the
absence
of
the
deity
was
followed
by
precisely
the
same
disastrous
consequences
vegetation
fails
the
wailing
is
for
the
plants
the
first
lament
is
they
grow
not
the
wailing
is
for
the
barley
the
ears
grow
not
the
reproductive
energies
of
the
animal
kingdom
are
suspended
for
the
habitation
of
flocks
it
is
they
produce
not
for
the
perishing
wedded
ones
for
perishing
children
it
is
the
people
create
not
nor
can
we
evade
the
full
force
of
the
parallel
by
objecting
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
god
not
with
a
man
we
possess
the
recorded
names
of
who
played
the
rôle
of
tammuz
thus
even
for
that
early
period
the
commingling
of
the
two
conceptions
god
and
king
is
definitely
established
now
in
face
of
this
group
of
parallels
whose
close
correspondence
if
we
consider
their
separation
in
point
of
time
and
the
present
day
is
nothing
short
of
astonishing
is
it
not
absolutely
and
utterly
unreasonable
to
admit
as
scholars
no
longer
hesitate
to
do
the
relationship
between
the
first
and
last
and
exclude
as
a
mere
literary
invention
the
intermediate
parallel
the
ground
for
such
a
denial
may
be
mere
prejudice
a
reluctance
to
renounce
a
long
cherished
critical
prepossession
but
in
the
face
of
this
new
evidence
does
it
not
come
perilously
close
to
scientific
dishonesty
to
a
disregard
for
that
respect
for
truth
in
research
the
imperative
duty
of
which
has
been
so
finely
expressed
by
the
late
gaston
je
professe
absolument
et
sans
réserve
cette
doctrine
que
la
science

que
la
vérité
et
la
vérité
pour
sans
aucun
souci
des
conséquences
bonnes
ou
mauvaises
regrettables
ou
heureuses
que
cette
vérité
pourrait
avoir
dans
la
pratique
when
we
further
consider
that
behind
these
three
main
parallels
linking
them
together
there
lies
a
continuous
chain
of
evidence
expressed
alike
in
classical
literature
and
surviving
folk
practice
i
would
submit
that
there
is
no
longer
any
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
in
the
grail
king
we
have
a
romantic
literary
version
of
that
strange
mysterious
figure
whose
presence
hovers
in
the
shadowy
background
of
the
history
of
our
aryan
race
the
figure
of
a
divine
or
ruler
at
once
god
and
king
upon
whose
life
and
unimpaired
vitality
the
existence
of
his
land
and
people
directly
depends
and
if
we
once
grant
this
initial
fact
and
resolve
that
we
will
no
longer
in
the
interests
of
an
outworn
critical
tradition
deny
the
weight
of
scientific
evidence
in
determining
the
real
significance
of
the
story
does
it
not
inevitably
follow
as
a
logical
sequence
that
such
versions
as
fail
to
connect
the
misfortunes
of
the
land
directly
with
the
disability
of
the
king
but
make
them
dependent
upon
the
failure
of
the
quester
are
by
that
very
fact
stamped
as
secondary
versions
that
by
this
one
detail
of
capital
importance
they
approve
themselves
as
literary
treatments
of
a
traditional
theme
the
true
meaning
of
which
was
unknown
to
the
author
let
us
for
a
moment
consider
what
the
opposite
view
would
entail
that
a
story
which
was
originally
the
outcome
of
pure
literary
invention
should
in
the
course
of
have
been
accidentally
brought
into
close
and
detailed
correspondence
with
a
deeply
rooted
sequence
of
popular
faith
and
practice
is
simply
inconceivable
the
if
there
were
must
have
been
intentional
the
men
whose
handiwork
it
was
were
in
possession
of
the
requisite
knowledge
but
how
did
they
possess
that
knowledge
and
why
should
they
undertake
such
a
task
surely
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
antiquarian
interest
as
might
be
done
they
were
no
twelfth
century
frazers
and
mannhardts
the
subject
must
have
had
for
them
a
more
living
a
more
intimate
interest
and
if
in
face
of
the
evidence
we
now
possess
we
feel
bound
to
admit
the
existence
of
such
knowledge
is
it
not
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
men
who
first
told
the
story
were
the
men
who
knew
and
that
the
confusion
was
due
to
those
who
with
more
literary
skill
but
less
information
the
original
theme
in
view
of
the
present
facts
i
would
submit
that
the
problem
posed
in
our
first
chapter
may
be
held
to
be
solved
that
we
accept
as
a
fait
acquis
the
conclusion
that
the
woes
of
the
land
are
directly
dependent
upon
the
sickness
or
maiming
of
the
king
and
in
no
wise
caused
by
the
failure
of
the
quester
the
of
the
land
must
be
held
to
have
been
antecedent
to
that
failure
and
the
gawain
versions
in
which
we
find
this
condition
fulfilled
are
therefore
prior
in
origin
to
the
perceval
in
which
the
is
brought
about
by
the
action
of
the
hero
in
some
versions
indeed
has
altogether
disappeared
from
the
story
thus
the
position
assigned
in
the
versions
to
this
feature
of
the
waste
land
becomes
one
of
capital
importance
as
a
critical
factor
this
is
a
point
which
has
hitherto
escaped
the
attention
of
scholars
the
misfortunes
of
the
land
have
been
treated
rather
as
an
accident
than
as
an
essential
of

personae
of

and

round
which
the
action
revolves
as
a
matter
of

i
believe
that
the

is
really
the
very
heart
of
our
problem
a
rightful
appreciation
of
its
position
and
significance
will
place
us
in
possession
of
the
clue
which
will
lead
us
safely
through
the
most
bewildering
mazes
of
the
fully
developed
tale
since
the
above
pages
were
written
dr
frazer
has
notified
the
discovery
of
a
second
african
parallel
equally
complete
and
striking
in
vol
xxvi
he
prints
under
the
title
a
in
nigeria
a
communication
received
from
mr
talbot
district
commissioner
in
nigeria
the
writer
states
that
the
dominant
of
elele
a
town
in
the
of
the
degema
district
is
a
elected
for
a
term
of
seven
years
the
whole
prosperity
of
the
town
especially
the
fruitfulness
of
farm
byre
and
was
linked
with
his
life
should
he
fall
sick
it
entailed
famine
and
grave
disaster
upon
the
inhabitants
so
soon
as
a
successor
is
appointed
the
former
holder
of
the
dignity
is
reported
to
for
himself
previous
to
the
introduction
of
ordered
government
it
is
admitted
that
at
any
time
during
his
seven
term
of
office
the
priest
might
be
put
to
death
by
any
man
sufficiently
strong
and
resourceful
consequently
it
is
only
on
the
rarest
occasions
in
fact
only
one
such
is
recorded
that
the
ventures
to
leave
his
compound
at
the
same
time
the
riches
derived
from
the
offerings
of
the
people
are
so
considerable
that
there
is
never
a
lack
of
candidates
for
the
office
from
this
and
the
evidence
cited
above
it
would
appear
that
the
institution
was
widely
spread
in
africa
and
at
the
same
time
it
affords
a
striking
proof
in
support
of
the
essential
soundness
of
dr
frazer
interpretation
of
the
priest
of
nemi
an
interpretation
which
has
been
violently
attacked
in
certain
quarters
very
largely
on
the
ground
that
no
one
would
be
found
willing
to
accept
an
office
involving
such
direct
danger
to
life
the
above
evidence
shows
clearly
that
not
only
does
such
an
office
exist
but
that
it
is
by
no
means
an
unpopular
post
chapter
vi
the
symbols
in
the
previous
chapters
we
have
discussed
the
grail
legend
from
a
general
rather
than
a
specific
point
of
view
we
have
endeavoured
to
ascertain
what
was
the
real
character
of
the
task
imposed
upon
the
hero
and
what
the
nature
and
value
of
his
achievement
we
have
been
led
to
the
conclusion
that
that
achievement
was
in
the
first
instance
of
an
altruistic
character
it
was
no
question
of
advantages
temporal
or
spiritual
which
should
accrue
to
the
quester
himself
but
rather
of
definite
benefits
to
be
won
for
others
the
freeing
of
a
ruler
and
his
land
from
the
dire
results
of
a
punishment
which
falling
upon
the
king
was
fraught
with
the
most
disastrous
consequences
for
his
kingdom
we
have
found
further
that
this
close
relation
between
the
ruler
and
his
land
which
resulted
in
the
ill
of
one
becoming
the
calamity
of
all
is
no
mere
literary
invention
proceeding
from
the
fertile
imagination
of
a
twelfth
century
court
poet
but
a
deeply
rooted
popular
belief
of
practically
immemorial
antiquity
and
inexhaustible
vitality
we
can
trace
it
back
thousands
of
years
before
the
christian
era
we
find
it
fraught
with
decisions
of
life
and
death
further
we
find
in
that
belief
a
tendency
to
express
itself
in
certain
ceremonial
practices
which
retain
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
the
character
of
the
ritual
observances
of
which
they
are
the
survival
mr
chambers
in
the
mediaeval
stage
remarks
if
the
comparative
study
of
religion
proves
anything
it
is
that
the
traditional
beliefs
and
customs
of
the
mediaeval
or
modern
peasant
are
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
but
the
detritus
of
heathen
mythology
and
heathen
worship
enduring
with
but
little
external
change
in
the
shadow
of
a
hostile
faith
this
is
notably
true
of
the
village
festivals
and
their
ludi
their
full
significance
only
appears
when
they
are
regarded
as
fragments
of
forgotten
cults
the
naďve
cults
addressed
by
a
primitive
folk
to
the
beneficent
deities
of
field
and
wood
and
river
or
the
shadowy
populace
of
its
own
dreams
we
may
i
think
take
it
that
we
have
established
at
least
the
possibility
that
in
the
grail
romances
we
possess
in
literary
form
an
example
of
the
detritus
above
referred
to
the
fragmentary
record
of
the
secret
ritual
of
a
fertility
cult
having
reached
this
hypothetical
conclusion
our
next
step
must
be
to
examine
the
symbols
of
this
cult
the
group
of
mysterious
objects
which
forms
the
central
point
of
the
action
a
true
understanding
of
the
nature
of
these
objects
being
as
essential
for
our
success
as
interpreters
of
the
story
as
it
was
for
the
success
of
the
quester
in
days
of
old
we
must
ask
whether
these
objects
the
grail
itself
whether
cup
or
dish
the
lance
the
sword
the
stone
one
and
all
invested
with
a
certain
atmosphere
of
awe
credited
with
strange
virtues
with
sanctity
itself
will
harmonize
with
the
proposed
solution
will
range
themselves
fitly
and
fairly
within
the
framework
of
this
hypothetical
ritual
that
they
should
do
so
is
a
matter
of
capital
importance
were
it
otherwise
the
theory
advanced
might
well
as
some
of
my
critics
have
maintained
get
beyond
the
region
of
ingenious
speculation
but
it
is
precisely
upon
the
fact
that
this
theory
of
origin
and
so
far
as
criticism
has
gone
this
theory
alone
does
permit
of
a
natural
and
unforced
interpretation
of
these
related
symbols
that
i
rely
as
one
of
the
most
convincing
proofs
of
the
correctness
of
my
hypothesis
before
commencing
the
investigation
there
is
one
point
which
i
would
desire
to
emphasize
the
imperative
necessity
for
treating
the
symbols
or
talismans
call
them
what
we
will
on
the
same
principle
as
we
have
treated
the
incidents
of
the
story
as
a
connected
whole
that
they
be
not
separated
the
one
from
the
other
and
made
the
subject
of
independent
treatment
but
that
they
be
regarded
in
their
relation
the
one
to
the
other
and
that
no
theory
of
origin
be
held
admissible
which
does
not
allow
for
that
relation
as
a
primitive
and
indispensable
factor
it
may
be
the
modern
tendency
to
specialize
which
is
apt
to
blind
scholars
to
the
essential
importance
of
regarding
their
object
of
study
as
a
whole
that
fosters
in
them
a
habit
of
focussing
their
attention
upon
that
one
point
or
incident
of
the
story
which
lends
itself
to
treatment
in
their
special
line
of
study
and
which
induces
them
to
minimize
or
ignore
those
elements
which
lie
outside
their
particular
range
but
whatever
the
cause
it
is
indubitable
that
this
method
of
by
isolation
has
been
and
is
one
of
the
main
factors
which
have
operated
in
retarding
the
solution
of
the
grail
problem
so
long
as
critics
of
the
story
will
insist
on
pulling
it
into
little
pieces
selecting
one
detail
here
another
there
for
study
and
elucidation
so
long
will
the
ensemble
result
be
chaotic
and
unsatisfactory
we
shall
continue
to
have
a
number
of
monographs
more
or
less
scholarly
in
treatment
one
dealing
with
the
grail
as
a
talisman
and
that
alone
another
with
the
grail
as
a
vehicle
of
spiritual
sustenance
one
that
treats
of
the
lance
as
a
pagan
weapon
and
nothing
more
another
that
regards
it
as
a
christian
relic
and
nothing
less
at
one
moment
the
object
of
the
study
will
be
the
fisher
king
without
any
relation
to
the
symbols
he
guards
or
the
land
he
rules
at
the
next
it
will
be
the
relation
of
the
quester
to
the
fisher
king
without
any
explanation
of
the
tasks
assigned
to
him
by
the
story
the
result
obtained
is
always
quite
satisfactory
to
the
writer
often
plausible
sometimes
in
a
measure
sound
but
it
would
defy
the
skill
of
the
most
synthetic
genius
to
the
results
thus
obtained
and
combine
them
in
one
harmonious
whole
they
are
like
pieces
of
a
puzzle
each
of
which
has
been
symmetrically
cut
and
trimmed
till
they
lie
side
by
side
and
and
we
have
been
pursuing
this
method
for
over
fifty
years
and
are
still
apparently
content
to
go
on
each
devoting
attention
to
the
symmetrical
perfection
of
his
own
little
section
of
the
puzzle
quite
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
our
neighbour
is
in
possession
of
an
equally
neatly
trimmed
fragment
which
entirely
refuses
to
fit
in
with
our
own
is
it
not
time
that
we
should
frankly
admit
the
unsatisfactory
results
of
these
years
of
labour
and
honestly
face
the
fact
that
while
we
now
have
at
our
disposal
an
immense
mass
of
interesting
and
suggestive
material
often
of
high
value
we
have
failed
so
far
to
formulate
a
conclusion
which
by
embracing
and
satisfying
the
manifold
conditions
of
the
problem
will
command
general
acceptance
and
if
this
failure
be
admitted
may
not
its
cause
be
sought
in
the
faulty
method
which
has
failed
to
recognize
in
the
grail
story
an
original
whole
in
which
the
parts
the
action
the
actors
the
symbols
the
result
to
be
obtained
incident
and
intention
stood
from
the
very
first
in
intimate
relation
the
one
to
the
other
that
while
in
process
of
utilization
as
a
literary
theme
these
various
parts
have
suffered
modification
and
accretion
from
this
or
that
side
the
problem
of
the
ultimate
source
remains
thereby
unaffected
such
a
reversal
of
method
as
i
suggest
will
i
submit
not
only
provide
us
with
a
critical
solution
capable
of
general
acceptance
but
it
will
also
enable
us
to
utilize
and
appreciate
at
their
due
value
the
result
of
researches
which
at
the
present
moment
appear
to
be
mutually
destructive
the
one
of
the
other
thus
while
the
purely
interpretation
of
the
grail
and
lance
excludes
the
christian
origin
and
the
theory
of
the
exclusively
christian
origin
negatives
the
the
of
these
symbols
in
a
popular
ritual
setting
would
admit
indeed
would
invite
later
accretion
alike
from
folk
belief
and
ecclesiastical
legend
we
are
the
gainers
by
any
light
that
can
possibly
be
thrown
upon
the
process
of
development
of
the
story
but
studies
of
the
separate
symbols
while
they
may
and
do
afford
valuable
data
for
determining
the
character
and
period
of
certain
accretions
should
not
be
regarded
as
supplying
proof
of
the
origin
of
the
related
group
reference
to
some
recent
studies
in
the
legend
will
make
my
meaning
clear
a
reviewer
of
my
small
quest
of
the
holy
grail
volume
remarked
that
i
appeared
to
be
ignorant
of
miss
peebles
study
the
legend
of
longinus
which
materially
strengthens
the
evidence
for
the
christian
origin
now
this
is
precisely
what
in
my
view
the
study
in
question
which
i
knew
and
possessed
does
not
do
as
evidence
for
the
fact
that
the
grail
legend
has
taken
over
certain
features
derived
from
the
popular
story
which
incidentally
no
one
disputed
the
essay
is
i
hold
sound
and
valuable
as
affording
material
for
determining
the
source
of
the
grail
story
it
is
on
the
other
hand
entirely
without
value
on
the
principle
laid
down
above
no
theory
which
purports
to
be
explanatory
of
the
source
of
one
symbol
can
be
held
satisfactory
in
a
case
where
that
symbol
does
not
stand
alone
we
can
not
accept
for
the
grail
story
a
theory
of
origin
which
concerns
itself
with
the
lance
as
independent
of
the
grail
in
the
study
referred
to
the
author
has
been
at
immense
pains
to
examine
the
different
versions
of
the
legend
and
to
trace
its
development
in
literature
in
no
single
instance
do
we
find
longinus
and
his
lance
associated
with
a
cup
or
vase
receptacle
of
the
sacred
blood
the
plain
fact
is
that
in
christian
art
and
tradition
lance
and
cup
are
not
associated
symbols
the
lance
or
spear
as
an
instrument
of
the
passion
is
found
in
conjunction
with
the
cross
nails
sponge
and
crown
of
thorns
anyone
familiar
with
the
wayside
crosses
of
catholic
europe
will
recognize
this
not
with
the
chalice
of
the
mass
this
latter
is
associated
with
the
host
or
agnus
dei
still
less
is
the
spear
to
be
found
in
connection
with
the
grail
in
its
form
of
a
dish
no
doubt
to
this
critics
who
share
the
views
of
golther
and
burdach
will
object
but
what
of
the
byzantine
mass
do
we
not
there
find
a
spear
connected
with
the
chalice
i
very
much
doubt
whether
we
do
the
spear
of
the
byzantine
and
present
greek
liturgy
is
simply
a
small
silver
knife
nor
can
i
discover
that
it
was
ever
anything
else
i
have
made
careful
enquiries
of
liturgical
scholars
and
consulted
editions
of
oriental
liturgies
but
i
can
find
no
evidence
that
the
knife
the
use
of
which
is
to
divide
the
loaf
which
in
the
oriental
rite
corresponds
to
the
wafer
of
the
occidental
in
a
manner
symbolically
corresponding
to
the
wounds
actually
inflicted
on
the
divine
victim
was
ever
other
than
what
it
is
it
seems
obvious
from
the
method
of
employment
that
an
actual
spear
could
hardly
have
been
used
it
would
have
been
an
impossibly
unwieldy
instrument
for
the
purpose
nor
is
the
in
which
the
elements
are
carried
from
the
chapel
of
the
prothesis
to
the
sanctuary
of
a
public
character
comparable
with
that
of
the
grail
castle
the
actual
ceremony
of
the
greek
mass
takes
place
of
course
behind
a
veil
a
point
of
considerable
interest
however
is
what
caused
this
difference
in
the
byzantine
liturgy
what
were
the
influences
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
a
feature
unknown
to
the
western
rite
if
as
the
result
of
the
evidence
set
forth
in
these
pages
the
ultimate
origin
of
the
grail
story
be
finally
accepted
as
deriving
from
a
prehistoric
ritual
possessing
elements
of
extraordinary
persistence
and
vitality
then
the
of
that
story
is
older
than
the
byzantine
ritual
students
of
the
subject
are
well
aware
that
the
tradition
of
ancient
rites
and
ceremonies
lingered
on
in
the
east
long
after
they
had
been
banished
by
the
more
practical
genius
of
the
west
it
may
well
prove
that
so
far
from
the
grail
story
being
a
reminiscence
of
the
byzantine
rite
that
rite
itself
has
been
affected
by
a
ritual
of
which
the
grail
legend
preserves
a
fragmentary
record
in
my
view
a
christian
origin
for
lance
and
cup
as
associated
symbols
has
not
been
made
out
still
less
can
it
be
postulated
for
lance
and
cup
as
members
of
an
extended
group
including
dish
sword
and
stone
on
this
point
professor
brown
attempt
to
find
in
irish
tradition
the
origin
of
the
grail
symbols
is
distinctly
more
satisfactory
i
can
not
accept
as
decisive
the
solution
proposed
which
seems
to
me
to
be
open
to
much
the
same
criticism
as
that
which
would
find
in
the
lance
the
lance
of
longinus
both
are
occupied
with
details
rather
than
with
ensemble
both
would
find
their
justification
as
offering
evidence
of
accretion
rather
than
of
origin
neither
can
provide
us
with
the
required
but
professor
brown
theory
is
the
more
sound
in
that
he
is
really
dealing
with
a
group
of
associated
symbols
in
his
view
lance
and
grail
alike
belong
to
the
treasures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
that
legendary
race
of
irish
ancestors
who
were
at
once
gods
and
kings
and
therefore
ab
initio
belong
together
but
while
i
should
on
the
whole
accept
the
affiliation
of
the
two
groups
and
believe
that
the
treasures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
really
correspond
to
the
symbols
displayed
in
the
hall
of
the
grail
castle
i
can
not
consider
that
the
one
is
the
origin
of
the
other
there
is
one
very
fundamental
difference
the
importance
of
which
i
can
not
ignore
but
which
i
believe
has
hitherto
escaped
professor
brown
attention
the
object
corresponding
to
the
grail
itself
is
the
cauldron
of
the
dagda
no
company
ever
went
from
it
unthankful
or
now
this
can
in
no
sense
be
considered
as
a
cup
or
vase
nor
is
it
the
true
parallel
to
a
dish
the
connection
with
the
grail
is
to
be
found
solely
and
exclusively
in
the
properties
ascribed
to
both
but
even
here
the
position
is
radically
different
the
impression
we
derive
from
the
irish
text
and
its
analogous
parallels
is
that
of
size
it
is
also
called
a
and
inexhaustible
content
it
is
a
cauldron
of
plenty
now
neither
of
these
qualities
can
be
postulated
of
the
grail
whatever
its
form
cup
or
dish
it
can
easily
be
borne
in
uplifted
hands
entre
ses
mains
hautement
porte
by
a
maiden
which
certainly
could
not
be
postulated
of
a
cauldron
nor
is
there
any
proof
that
the
vessel
itself
contained
the
food
with
which
the
folk
of
the
grail
castle
were
regaled
the
texts
rather
point
to
the
conclusion
that
the
appearance
of
the
grail
synchronized
with
a
mysterious
supply
of
food
of
a
choice
and
varied
character
there
is
never
any
hint
that
the
folk
feed
from
the
grail
the
only
suggestion
of
such
feeding
is
in
the
by
which
the
father
of
the
fisher
king
or
the
king
himself
is
nourished
in
certain
texts
the
separation
of
the
two
is
clearly
brought
out
in
joseph
of
arimathea
for
instance
the
fish
caught
by
brons
is
to
be
placed
at
one
end
of
the
table
the
grail
at
the
other
in
adventure
at
the
grail
castle
in
the
prose
lancelot
as
the
grail
is
carried
through
the
hall
forthwith
were
the
tables
replenished
with
the
choicest
meats
in
the
world
but
the
table
before
gawain
remains
void
and
bare
i
submit
that
while
the
grail
is
in
certain
phases
a
talisman
it
is
not
one
of
the
same
character
as
the
cauldrons
of
plenty
also
while
the
food
supply
of
these
latter
has
the
marked
characteristic
of
quantity
that
of
the
grail
is
remarkable
rather
for
quality
its
choice
character
is
always
insisted
upon
the
perusal
of
professor
brown
subsequent
study
notes
on
celtic
cauldrons
of
plenty
and
the
has
confirmed
me
in
my
view
that
these
special
objects
belong
to
another
line
of
tradition
altogether
that
which
deals
with
an
inexhaustible
submarine
source
of
life
examples
of
which
will
be
found
in
the
of
the
finnish
kalewala
and
the
mills
of
popular
the
fundamental
idea
here
seems
to
be
that
of
the
origin
of
all
life
from
water
a
very
ancient
idea
but
one
which
though
akin
to
the
grail
tradition
is
yet
quite
distinct
therefrom
the
study
of
this
special
theme
would
i
believe
produce
valuable
results
on
the
whole
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
treasures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
and
the
symbols
of
the
grail
castle
go
back
to
a
common
original
but
that
they
have
developed
on
different
lines
in
the
process
of
this
development
one
symbol
has
been
exchanged
for
another
but
lance
and
cup
or
vase
were
in
truth
connected
together
in
a
symbolic
relation
long
ages
before
the
institution
of
christianity
or
the
birth
of
celtic
tradition
they
are
sex
symbols
of
immemorial
antiquity
and
diffusion
the
lance
or
spear
representing
the
male
the
cup
or
vase
the
female
reproductive
energy
found
in
juxtaposition
the
spear
upright
in
the
vase
as
in
the
bleheris
and
balin
both
be
it
noted
gawain
forms
their
signification
is
admitted
by
all
familiar
with
symbolism
and
they
are
absolutely
in
place
as
forming
part
of
a
ritual
dealing
with
the
processes
of
life
and
reproductive
vitality
a
most
remarkable
and
significant
use
of
these
symbols
is
found
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
samurai
the
noble
warrior
caste
of
japan
the
aspirant
was
i
am
told
still
is
admitted
into
the
caste
at
the
age
of
fourteen
when
he
was
given
over
to
the
care
of
a
guardian
at
least
fifteen
years
his
senior
to
whom
he
took
an
oath
of
obedience
which
was
sworn
upon
the
spear
he
remained
celibate
during
the
period
covered
by
the
oath
when
the
samurai
was
held
to
have
attained
the
degree
of
responsibility
which
would
fit
him
for
the
full
duties
of
a
citizen
a
second
solemn
ceremony
was
held
at
which
he
was
released
from
his
previous
vows
and
presented
with
the
cup
he
was
henceforth
free
to
marry
but
intercourse
with
women
previous
to
this
ceremony
was
at
one
time
punishable
with
death
that
lance
and
cup
are
outside
the
grail
story
symbols
and
have
been
such
from
time
immemorial
is
a
fact
why
then
should
they
not
retain
that
character
inside
the
framework
of
that
story
an
acceptance
of
this
interpretation
will
not
only
be
in
harmony
with
the
general
but
it
will
also
explain
finally
and
satisfactorily
a
the
dominant
position
frequently
assigned
to
the
lance
b
the
fact
that
while
the
lance
is
borne
in
procession
by
a
youth
the
grail
is
carried
by
a
maiden
the
sex
of
the
bearer
corresponds
with
the
symbol
borne
but
lance
and
cup
though
the
most
prominent
of
the
symbols
do
not
always
appear
alone
but
are
associated
with
other
objects
the
significance
of
which
is
not
always
apparent
thus
the
dish
which
is
sometimes
the
form
assumed
by
the
grail
itself
at
other
times
appears
as
a
tailléor
or
carving
platter
of
silver
carried
in
the
same
procession
as
the
grail
or
there
may
be
two
small
tailléors
finally
a
sword
appears
in
varying
rôles
in
the
story
i
have
already
referred
to
the
fact
first
pointed
out
by
the
late
mr
alfred
nutt
that
the
four
treasures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
correspond
generally
with
the
group
of
symbols
found
in
the
grail
romances
this
correspondence
becomes
the
more
interesting
in
view
of
the
fact
that
these
mysterious
beings
are
now
recognized
as
alike
demons
of
fertility
and
lords
of
life
as
mr
nutt
subsequently
pointed
out
the
may
well
be
sword
and
cauldron
certainly
are
symbols
of
direct
connection
between
these
celtic
objects
and
the
grail
story
there
is
no
trace
as
remarked
above
we
have
no
irish
folk
or
hero
tale
at
all
corresponding
to
the
legend
the
relation
must
therefore
go
back
beyond
the
date
of
formation
of
these
tales
it
must
be
considered
as
one
of
origin
rather
than
of
dependence
but
we
have
further
evidence
that
these
four
objects
do
in
fact
form
a
special
group
entirely
independent
of
any
appearance
in
or
romance
they
exist
as
the
four
suits
of
the
tarot
students
of
the
grail
texts
whose
attention
is
mainly
occupied
with
medieval
literature
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
word
tarot
or
aware
of
its
meaning
it
is
the
name
given
to
a
pack
of
cards
in
number
of
which
are
designated
as
the
these
cards
are
divided
into
four
suits
which
correspond
with
those
of
the
ordinary
cards
they
are
cup
chalice
or
goblet
hearts
lance
wand
or
sceptre
diamonds
sword
spades
dish
circles
or
pentangles
the
form
varies
clubs
the
tarot
has
fallen
somewhat
into
disrepute
being
principally
used
for
purposes
of
divination
but
its
origin
and
precise
relation
to
our
present
are
questions
of
considerable
antiquarian
interest
were
these
cards
the
direct
parents
of
our
modern
pack
or
are
they
entirely
distinct
therefrom
some
writers
are
disposed
to
assign
a
very
high
antiquity
to
the
tarot
traditionally
it
is
said
to
have
been
brought
from
egypt
there
is
no
doubt
that
parallel
designs
and
combinations
are
to
be
found
in
the
surviving
decorations
of
egyptian
temples
notably
in
the
astronomic
designs
on
the
ceiling
of
one
of
the
halls
of
the
palace
of
medinet
abou
which
is
supported
on
columns
a
number
corresponding
to
the
of
the
tarot
and
also
repeated
in
a
calendar
sculptured
on
the
southern
façade
of
the
same
building
under
a
sovereign
of
the
xxiii
dynasty
this
calendar
is
supposed
to
have
been
connected
with
the
periodic
rise
and
fall
of
the
waters
of
the
nile
the
tarot
has
also
been
connected
with
an
ancient
chinese
monument
traditionally
erected
in
commemoration
of
the
drying
up
of
the
waters
of
the
deluge
by
yao
the
face
of
this
monument
is
divided
up
into
small
sections
corresponding
in
size
and
number
with
the
cards
of
the
tarot
and
bearing
characters
which
have
so
far
not
been
deciphered
what
is
certain
is
that
these
cards
are
used
by
the
gipsies
for
purposes
of
divination
and
the
opinion
of
those
who
have
studied
the
subject
is
that
there
is
some
real
ground
for
the
popular
tradition
that
they
were
introduced
into
europe
by
this
mysterious
people
in
a
very
interesting
article
on
the
subject
in
the
journal
of
the
society
mr
de
la
hoste
ranking
examines
closely
into
the
figures
depicted
on
the
various
cards
and
the
names
attached
to
the
suits
by
the
gipsies
he
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
many
of
the
words
are
of
sanskrit
or
hindustani
origin
and
sums
up
the
result
of
the
internal
evidence
as
follows
the
tarot
was
introduced
by
a
race
speaking
an
indian
dialect
the
figure
known
as
shows
the
influence
of
the
orthodox
eastern
faith
he
is
bearded
and
carries
the
triple
cross
the
card
called
king
represents
a
figure
with
the
of
a
russian
and
a
shield
bearing
the
polish
eagle
thus
the
people
who
used
the
tarot
must
have
been
familiar
with
a
country
where
the
orthodox
faith
prevailed
and
which
was
ruled
by
princes
of
the
status
of
the
general
result
seems
to
point
to
a
genuine
basis
for
the
belief
that
the
tarot
was
introduced
into
europe
from
the
east
as
regards
the
group
of
symbols
in
general
mr
yeats
whose
practical
acquaintance
with
medieval
and
modern
magic
is
well
known
writes
cup
lance
dish
sword
in
slightly
varying
forms
have
never
lost
their
mystic
significance
and
are
a
part
of
magical
operations
the
memory
kept
by
the
four
suits
of
the
tarot
cup
lance
sword
pentangle
dish
is
an
esoterical
notation
for
purposes
but
if
the
connection
with
the
egyptian
and
chinese
monuments
referred
to
above
is
genuine
the
original
use
of
the
would
seem
to
have
been
not
to
foretell
the
future
in
general
but
to
predict
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
waters
which
brought
fertility
to
the
land
such
use
would
bring
the
into
line
with
the
analogous
symbols
of
the
grail
castle
and
the
treasures
of
the
tuatha
de
danann
both
of
which
we
have
seen
to
be
connected
with
the
embodiment
of
the
reproductive
forces
of
nature
if
it
is
difficult
to
establish
a
direct
connection
between
these
two
latter
it
is
practically
impossible
to
argue
any
connection
between
either
group
and
the
no
one
has
as
yet
ventured
to
suggest
the
popularity
of
the
works
of
chrétien
de
troyes
among
the
gipsies
yet
the
correspondence
can
hardly
be
fortuitous
i
would
suggest
that
while
lance
and
cup
in
their
associated
form
are
primarily
symbols
of
human
life
energy
in
conjunction
with
others
they
formed
a
group
of
symbols
connected
with
a
very
ancient
ritual
of
which
fragmentary
survivals
alone
have
been
preserved
to
us
this
view
will
i
believe
receive
support
from
the
evidence
of
the
ceremonial
dances
which
formed
so
important
a
part
of
ritual
and
which
survive
in
so
many
places
to
this
day
if
we
find
these
symbols
reappearing
as
a
part
of
these
dances
their
real
significance
can
hardly
be
disputed
chapter
vii
the
sword
dance
the
subject
we
are
now
about
to
consider
is
one
which
of
late
years
has
attracted
considerable
attention
and
much
acute
criticism
has
been
expended
on
the
question
of
its
origin
and
significance
valuable
material
has
been
collected
but
the
studies
so
far
have
been
individual
and
independent
the
much
needed
travail
has
not
yet
appeared
one
definite
result
has
however
been
obtained
it
is
now
generally
admitted
that
the
sword
dances
with
the
closely
related
morris
dances
and
mumming
plays
are
not
mere
survivals
of
martial
exercises
an
inherited
tradition
from
our
warrior
ancestors
but
were
solemn
ceremonial
in
some
cases
there
is
reason
to
believe
initiatory
dances
performed
at
stated
seasons
of
the
year
and
directly
and
intimately
connected
with
the
ritual
of
which
we
have
treated
in
previous
chapters
a
ritual
designed
to
preserve
and
promote
the
regular
and
ordered
sequence
of
the
processes
of
nature
and
here
again
our
enquiry
must
begin
with
the
very
earliest
records
of
our
race
with
the
traditions
of
our
aryan
forefathers
the
earliest
recorded
sword
dancers
are
undoubtedly
the
maruts
those
youths
in
gleaming
armour
who
are
the
faithful
attendants
on
the
great
god
indra
professor
von
schroeder
in
mysterium
und
mimus
describes
them
thus
they
are
a
group
of
youths
of
equal
age
and
identical
parentage
they
are
always
depicted
as
attired
in
the
same
manner
sie
sind
reich
und
prächtig
geschmückt
mit
goldschmuck
auf
der
brust
mit
spangen
an
den
händen
hirschfelle
tragen
sie
auf
den
schultern
vor
allem

sind
sie
kriegerisch
gerüstet
funkelnde
speere

sie
in

oder
auch

oder

auf
ihren
häuptern
nie
erscheinen
sie
ohne
wehr
und
waffen
es
scheint
dass
diese
ganz
und
gar
zu
ihren
wesen
gehören
the
writer
goes
on
to
remark
that
when
such
a
band
of
armed
youths
all
of
the
same
age
always
closely
associated
with
each
other
are
represented
as
dancers
and
always
as
dancers
dann
haben
wir
unabweislich
das
bild
eines
waffentanzes
vor
unseren
augen
and
professor
von
schroeder
is
undoubtedly
right
constantly
throughout
the
the
maruts
are
referred
to
as
dancers
dancers
with
songs
of
praise
they
danced
round
the
spring
when
ye
maruts
dance
they
the
heavens
stream
together
like
waves
of
water
and
a
special
moment
for
the
dance
of
these
glorious
youths
ever
young
brothers
of
whom
none
is
elder
none
younger
is
that
of
the
ceremonial
sacrifice
sie
tanzen
auf
ihren
himmlischen
bahnen
sie
springen
und
tanzen
auch
bei
den
opferfesten
der
menschen
the
maruts
as
said
above
were
conceived
of
as
the
companions
of
indra
and
helpers
in
his
fight
against
his
monstrous
adversaries
thus
they
were
included
in
the
sacrifices
offered
in
honour
of
that
deity
one
of
the
most
striking
of
the
ritual
dramas
reconstructed
by
professor
von
schroeder
is
that
which
represents
indra
as
indignantly
rejecting
the
claim
of
the
maruts
to
share
in
such
a
sacrifice
they
had
failed
to
support
him
in
his
conflict
with
the
dragon
vritra
when
by
his
might
he
loosed
the
waters
nor
will
he
accept
a
sacrifice
of
which
they
share
the
honour
it
requires
all
the
tact
of
the
offerer
agastya
and
of
the
leader
of
the
maruts
to
soothe
the
offended
deity
here
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
significant
fact
that
the
feat
celebrated
is
that
to
which
i
have
previously
referred
as
the
most
famous
of
all
the
deeds
attributed
to
indra
the
of
the
waters
and
here
the
maruts
are
associated
with
the
god
but
they
were
also
the
objects
of
independent
worship
they
were
specially
honoured
at
the
câturmâsya
the
feasts
which
heralded
the
commencement
of
the
three
seasons
of
four
months
each
into
which
the
indian
year
was
divided
a
division
corresponding
respectively
to
the
hot
the
cool
and
the
wet
season
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
the
worship
of
the
maruts
may
be
deduced
from
the
following
extracts
from
the
which
devotes
more
than
thirty
hymns
to
their
praise
the
adorable
maruts
armed
with
bright
lances
and
cuirassed
with
golden
breastplates
enjoy
vigorous
existence
may
the
cars
of
the
maruts
arrive
for
our
good
bringers
of
rain
and
fertility
shedding
water
augmenting
food
givers
of
abundant
food
your
milchkine
are
never
dry
we
invoke
the
chariots
of
the
maruts
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
this
the
maruts
are
of
fertility
the
worship
of
whom
will
secure
the
necessary
supply
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
close
association
of
the
maruts
with
indra
the
great
nature
god
has
led
some
scholars
to
regard
them
as
personifications
of
a
special
manifestation
of
nature
as
professor
von
schroeder
points
out
that
their
father
was
the
god
rudra
later
known
as
çiva
the
god
of
departed
souls
and
of
fruitfulness
a
chthonian
deity
and
suggests
that
the
maruts
represent
the
in
wind
und
sturm
dahinjagende
seelenschar
he
points
out
that
the
belief
in
a
troop
of
departed
souls
is
an
integral
part
of
aryan
tradition
and
classifies
such
belief
under
four
main
headings
under
the
form
of
a
spectral
hunt
the
wild
huntsman
well
known
in
european
he
equates
this
with
dionysus
zagreus
and
the
hunt
of
that
of
a
spectral
army
the
souls
of
warriors
slain
in
fight
the
northern
einherier
belong
to
this
class
and
the
many
traditions
of
spectral
combats
and
ghostly
battles
heard
but
not
seen
the
conception
of
a
host
of
women
in
a
condition
of
ecstatic
exaltation
bordering
on
madness
who
appear
girdled
with
snakes
or
hissing
like
snakes
tear
living
animals
to
pieces
and
devour
the
flesh
the
classic
examples
here
are
the
greek
maenads
and
the
indian
senâs
who
accompany
rudra
the
conception
of
a
train
of
theriomorphic
phallic
demons
of
fertility
with
their
companion
group
of
fair
women
such
are
the
satyrs
and
nymphs
of
greek
the
gandharvas
and
apsaras
of
indian
mythology
to
these
four
main
groups
may
be
added
the
belief
among
germanic
peoples
also
among
the
letts
in
a
troop
of
child
souls
these
four
groups
in
more
or
less
modified
forms
appear
closely
connected
with
the
dominant
spirit
of
vegetation
by
whatever
name
that
spirit
may
be
known
according
to
von
schroeder
there
was
among
the
aryan
peoples
generally
a
tendency
to
regard
the
dead
as
assuming
the
character
of
daimons
of
fertility
this
view
the
learned
professor
considers
to
be
at
the
root
of
the
annual
celebrations
in
honour
of
the
departed
the
of
souls
which
characterized
the
commencement
of
the
winter
season
and
is
retained
in
the
catholic
conception
of
november
as
the
month
of
the
dead
in
any
case
we
may
safely
conclude
that
the
maruts
represented
as
armed
youths
were
worshipped
as
deities
of
fruitfulness
that
their
dances
were
of
a
ceremonial
character
and
that
they
were
by
nature
and
origin
closely
connected
with
spirits
of
fertility
of
a
lower
order
such
as
the
gandharvas
it
also
appears
probable
that
if
the
dramas
of
which
traces
have
been
preserved
in
the
were
as
scholars
are
now
of
opinion
once
actually
represented
the
mythological
conception
of
the
maruts
must
have
found
its
embodiment
in
youths
most
probably
of
the
priestly
caste
who
played
their
rôle
and
actually
danced
the
ceremonial
sword
dance
as
von
schroeder
says
kein
zweifel
dass
sie
dabei
von

resp
priesterlichen
personen
dargestellt
wurden
when
we
turn
from
the
early
aryan
to
the
classic
greek
period
we
find
in
the
kouretes
and
in
a
minor
degree
in
the
korybantes
a
parallel
so
extraordinarily
complete
alike
in
action
and
significance
that
an
essential
identity
of
origin
appears
to
be
beyond
doubt
the
kouretes
were
as
their
name
indicates
a
band
of
armed
youths
of
origin
kureten

be

as

and
as

of

preller
regards
them
as

while
a
passage
from
hesiod
quoted
by
strabo
equates
them
with
nymphs
and
satyrs
fertility
demons
when
we
remember
that
the
gandharvas
are
the
indian
equivalent
of
the
satyrs
the
close
parallel
between
the
maruts
and
the
kouretes
both
alike
bands
of
armed
youths
of
elementary
origin
and
connected
with
beings
of
a
lower
grade
is
striking
the
home
of
the
kouretes
was
in
crete
where
they
were
closely
associated
with
the
worship
of
the
goddess
rhea
the
traditional
story
held
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
infant
zeus
from
destruction
by
his
father
kronos
they
danced
their
famous
sword
dance
round
the
babe
overpowering
his
cries
by
the
clash
of
their
weapons
their
dance
was
by
some
writers
identified
with
the
pyrrhic
dance
first
performed
by
athene
in
honour
of
her
victory
over
the
giants
and
taught
by
her
to
the
kouretes
it
had
however
as
we
shall
see
a
very
distinct
aim
and
purpose
and
one
in
no
way
connected
with
warlike
ends
in

gives
the
translation
of
a
fragmentary
hymn
of
the
kouretes
discovered
among
the
ruins
of
a
temple
in
crete
a
text
which
places
beyond
all
doubt
the
fact
that
however
mythical
in
origin
the
kouretes
certainly
had
actual
human
representatives
and
that
while
in
the
case
of
the
maruts
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
whether
their
dance
actually
took
place
or
not
so
far
as
the
kouretes
are
concerned
there
can
be
no
such
doubt
the
following
is
the
text

preserved

us

is
most
extraordinarily
interesting
it
places
beyond
all
doubt
what
was
the
root
intention
of
this
ceremonial
dance
it
was
designed

stimulate
the
reproductive
energies

bring

increase

the
importance
of

notably
of
what
we
may
call
group
movement
as
a
stimulant
to
natural
energies
is
thoroughly
recognized
among
primitive
peoples

them

holds
a
position
equivalent
to
that
which
in
more
advanced
communities
is
assigned

cites
the
case
of
the
tarahumara
indians
of
central
america
while
the
family
as
a
whole
are
labouring
in
the
fields
it
is
the
office
of
one
man
to
dance
uninterruptedly
on
the
dance
place
of
the
house
if
he
fails
in
his
office
the
labour
of
the
others
will
be
unsuccessful
the
one
sin
of
which
a
tarahumara
indian
is
conscious
is
that
of
not
having
danced
enough
miss
harrison
in
commenting
on
the
dance
of
the
kouretes
remarks
that
among
certain
savage
tribes
when
a
man
is
too
old
to
dance
he
hands
on
his
dance
to
another
he
then
ceases
to
exist
socially
when
he
dies
his
funeral
is
celebrated
with
scanty
rites
having
his
dance
he
has
ceased
to
count
as
a
social
unit
with
regard
to
the
connection
of
the
kouretes
with
the
infant
zeus
miss
harrison
makes
the
interesting
suggestion
that
we
have
here
a
trace
of
an
initiation
dance
analogous
to
those
discussed
by
van
gennep
in
his
rites
du
passage
that
the
original
form
was
titan
men
which
later
became
titan
and
she
draws
attention
to
the
fact
that
daubing
the
skin
with
white
clay
is
a
frequent
practice
in
these
primitive
rituals
to
this
i
would
add
that
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
in
our
modern
survivals
of
these
dances
the
performers
are
as
a
rule
dressed
in
white
note
weston
first
titan
above
had
schwa
accents
over
the
vowels
the
second
titan
had
macron
accents
over
the
vowels
the
above
suggestion
is
of
extreme
significance
as
it
brings
out
the
possibility
that
these
celebrations
were
not
only
concerned
with
the
prosperity
of
the
community
as
a
whole
but
may
also
have
borne
a
special
and
individual
aspect
and
that
the
idea
of
initiation
into
the
group
is
closely
connected
with
the
ceremonial
exercise
of
group
functions
to
sum
up
there
is
direct
proof
that
the
classic
greeks
in
common
with
their
aryan
forefathers
held
the
conception
of
a
group
of
beings
of
mythic
origin
represented
under
the
form
of
armed
youths
who
were
noted
dancers
and
whose
activities
were
closely
connected
with
the
processes
of
nature
they
recognized
a
relation
between
these
beings
and
others
of
a
less
highly
developed
aspect
phallic
demons
often
of
theriomorphic
form
thus
the
dance
of
the
kouretes
should
be
considered
as
a
ceremonial
ritual
action
rather
than
as
a
warlike
exercise
it
was
designed
to
promote
the
fruitfulness
of
the
earth
not
to
display
the
skill
of
the
dancers
in
the
handling
of
weapons
when
we
turn
to
an
analogous
group
that
of
the
korybantes
we
find
that
while
presenting
a
general
parallel
to
the
kouretes
with
whom
they
are
often
coupled
in
mythologies
they
also
possess
certain
distinct
characteristics
which
form
a
connecting
link
with
other
and
later
groups
the
korybantes
were
of
phrygian
origin
attached
to
the
worship
of
the
goddess
kybele
and
attis
the
phrygian
counterpart
to
the
phoenician
adonis
and
originally
the
most
important
embodiment
of
the
vegetation
spirit
röscher
considers
them
to
be
of
identical
origin
with
the
kouretes
as
elementary
but
the
korybantes
of
classic
art
and
tradition
are
undoubtedly
human
beings
priests
of
kybele
they
appear
in
surviving
in
company
with
that
goddess
and
with
attis
the
dance
of
the
korybantes
is
distinguished
from
that
of
the
kouretes
by
its
less
restrained
and
more
orgiastic
character
it
was
a
wild
and
whirling
dance
resembling
that
of
the
modern
dervishes
accompanied
by
and
an
unrhythmic
clashing
of
weapons
designed
some
writers
think
to
overpower
the
cries
of
the
victims
if
this
suggestion
be
correct
it
would
seem
to
indicate
that
if
the
dance
of
the
kouretes
was
originally
an
initiation
dance
that
of
the
korybantes
was
sacrificial
in
character
we
shall
see
later
that
certain
features
in
the
surviving
forms
of
the
sword
dance
also
point
in
this
direction
the
interest
of
the
korybantes
for
our
investigation
lies
in
the
fact
that
here
again
we
have
the
sword
dance
in
close
and
intimate
connection
with
the
worship
of
the
vegetation
spirit
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
here
as
elsewhere
it
was
held
to
possess
a
stimulating
virtue
a
noticeable
point
in
the
modern
survivals
of
these
dances
is
that
the
dance
proper
is
combined
with
a
more
or
less
coherent
dramatic
action
the
sword
dance
originally
did
not
stand
alone
but
formed
part
of
a
drama
to
the
action
of
which
it
may
be
held
to
have
given
a
cumulative
force
on
this
point
i
would
refer
the
reader
to
professor
von
book
where
this
aspect
of
the
dance
is
fully
discussed
we
have
already
spoken
of
the
maruts
and
their
dramatic
connection
with
indra
the
greek
dancers
offer
us
no
direct
parallel
though
the
connection
of
the
kouretes
with
the
infant
zeus
may
quite
possibly
indicate
the
existence
in
the
original
form
of
the
dance
of
a
more
distinctly
dramatic
element
we
have
however
in
the
roman
salii
a
connecting
link
which
proves
beyond
all
doubt
that
our
modern
dances
and
analogous
representations
are
in
fact
genuine
survivals
of
primitive
ceremonies
and
in
no
way
a
mere
fortuitous
combination
of
originally
independent
elements
the
salii
formed
a
college
of
priests
twelve
in
number
dedicated
to
the
service
of
mars
who
it
is
important
to
remember
was
originally
a
god
of
growth
and
vegetation
a
spring
deity
who
bestowed
his
name
on
the
vernal
month
of
march
only
by
degrees
did
the
activities
of
the
god
become
specially
connected
with
the
domain
of
war
there
seem
to
have
been
two
groups
of
salii
one
having
their
college
on
the
palatine
the
other
on
the
quirinal
the
first
were
the
more
important
the
quirinal
group
shared
in
the
celebrations
of
the
latter
part
of
the
month
only
the
first
of
march
was
the
traditional
birthday
of
mars
and
from
that
date
during
the
whole
of
the
month
the
salii
offered
sacrifices
and
performed
dances
in
his
honour
they
wore
pointed
caps
or
helmets
on
their
head
were
girt
with
swords
and
carried
on
the
left
arm
shields
copied
from
the
or
traditional
shield
of
mars
fabled
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
in
their
right
hand
they
bore
a
small
lance
dionysus
of
halicarnassus
in
a
passage
describing
the
salii
says
they
carried
in
their
right
hand
a
spear
or
staff
or
something
of
that
sort
miss
harrison
quoting
this
passage
gives
a
reproduction
of
a
representing
the
salii
carrying
what
she
says
are
clearly
drumsticks
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
very
closely
resemble
the
which
in
the
tarot
cards
sometimes
represent
the
suit
miss
harrison
suggests
that
the
original
shields
were
made
of
skins
stretched
upon
a
frame
and
beaten
by
these
this
may
quite
well
have
been
the
case
and
it
would
bear
out
my
contention
that
the
original
contact
of
weapon
and
shield
was
designed
rather
as
a
rhythmic
accompaniment
to
the
dance
than
as
a
display
of
skill
in
handling
sword
and
lance
that
these
dances
were
not
primarily
warlike
exercises
at
the
conclusion
of
their
songs
the
salii
invoked
mamurius
veturius
the
smith
who
was
fabled
to
have
executed
the
copies
of
the
original
shield
while
on
the
of
march
a
man
dressed
in
skins
and
supposed
to
represent
the
aforesaid
smith
was
led
through
the
streets
beaten
by
the
salii
with
rods
and
thrust
out
of
the
city
the
following
day
the
was
the
feast
of
anna
perenna
fabled
to
be
an
old
woman
to
whom
mars
had
confided
the
tale
of
his
love
for
nerio
and
who
disguising
herself
as
the
maiden
had
gone
through
the
ceremony
of
marriage
with
the
god
this
feast
was
held
outside
the
gates
on
the
the
combined
feast
of
mars
and
nerio
was
held
with
great
rejoicing
throughout
the
city
modern
scholars
have
unanimously
recognized
in
mamurius
veturius
and
anna
perenna
the
representatives
of
the
old
year
the
vegetation
spirit
and
his
female
counterpart
who
grown
old
must
yield
place
to
the
young
god
and
his
correspondingly
youthful
bride
reference
to
chapter
where
the
medieval
and
modern
forms
of
this
nature
ritual
are
discussed
and
instances
of
the
carrying
out
of
winter
and
ceremonial
bringing
in
of
spring
are
given
will
suffice
to
show
how
vital
and
enduring
an
element
in
is
this
idea
of
driving
out
the
old
year
while
celebrating
the
birth
of
the
new
here
then
again
we
have
a
ritual
sword
dance
closely
associated
with
the
practice
of
a
nature
cult
there
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
that
ab
initio
the
two
were
connected
with
each
other
but
the
dance
of
the
salii
with
its
dramatic
features
forms
an
interesting
link
between
the
classic
dance
of
the
kouretes
and
the
modern
english
survivals
in
which
the
dramatic
element
is
strongly
marked
these
english
forms
may
be
divided
into
three
related
groups
the
sword
dance
the
morris
dance
and
the
mumming
play
of
these
the
morris
dance
stands
somewhat
apart
of
identical
origin
it
has
discarded
the
dramatic
element
and
now
survives
simply
as
a
dance
whereas
the
sword
dance
is
always
dramatic
in
form
and
the
mumming
play
acted
by
characters
appearing
also
in
the
sword
dance
invariably
contains
a
more
or
less
elaborate
fight
the
sword
dance
proper
appears
to
have
been
preserved
mostly
in
the
north
of
england
and
in
scotland
mr
cecil
sharp
has
found
four
distinct
varieties
in
yorkshire
alone
at
one
time
there
existed
a
special
variant
known
as
the
giants
dance
in
which
the
leading
characters
were
known
by
the
names
of
wotan
and
frau
frigg
one
figure
of
this
dance
consisted
in
making
a
ring
of
swords
round
the
neck
of
a
lad
without
wounding
him
mr
chambers
has
commented
on
this
as
the
survival
of
a
sacrificial
origin
the
remarks
of
this
writer
on
the
sword
dance
in
its
dramatic
aspect
are
so
much
to
the
point
that
i
quote
them
here
the
sword
dance
makes
its
appearance
not
like
heroic
poetry
in
general
as
part
of
the
minstrel
repertory
but
as
a
purely
popular
thing
at
the
agricultural
festivals
to
these
festivals
we
may
therefore
suppose
it
to
have
originally
belonged
mr
chambers
goes
on
to
remark
that
the
dance
of
the
salii
discussed
above
was
clearly
agricultural
and
belongs
to
mars
not
as
war
god
but
in
his
more
primitive
quality
of
a
fertilization
spirit
in
an
appendix
to
his
most
valuable
book
the
same
writer
gives
a
full
description
with
text
of
the
most
famous
surviving
form
of
the
sword
dance
that
of
papa
stour
old
norwegian
pâpey
in
stôra
one
of
the
shetland
islands
the
dance
was
performed
at
christmas
the
dancers
seven
in
number
represented
the
seven
champions
of
christendom
the
leader
saint
george
after
an
introductory
speech
performed
a
solo
dance
to
the
music
of
an
accompanying
minstrel
he
then
presented
his
comrades
one
by
one
each
in
turn
going
through
the
same
performance
finally
the
seven
together
performed
an
elaborate
dance
the
complete
text
of
the
speeches
is
given
in
the
appendix
referred
to
the
close
connection
between
the
english
sword
dance
and
the
mumming
play
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
the
chief
character
in
these
plays
is
generally
speaking
saint
george
the
title
has
in
some
cases
become
corrupted
into
king
george
in
professor
von
opinion
this
is
due
to
saint
george
legendary
rôle
as
dragon
slayer
and
he
sees
in
the
importance
assigned
to
this
hero
an
argument
in
favour
of
his
theory
that
the
slaying
of
the
dragon
was
the
earliest
aryan
in
vol
a
fully
illustrated
description
of
the
mumming
play
as
performed
at
newbold
a
village
near
rugby
is
given
here
the
characters
are
father
christmas
saint
george
a
turkish
knight
doctor
moll
finney
mother
of
the
knight
humpty
jack
beelzebub
and
these
last
three
have
no
share
in
the
action
proper
but
appear
in
a
kind
of
epilogue
accompanying
a
collection
made
by
beelzebub
the
play
is
always
performed
at
christmas
time
consequently
father
christmas
appears
as
and
introduces
the
characters
the
action
consists
in
a
general
challenge
issued
by
saint
george
and
accepted
by
the
turkish
knight
a
combat
follows
in
which
the
turk
is
slain
his
mother
rushes
in
weeps
over
the
body
and
demands
the
services
of
a
doctor
who
appears
accordingly
vaunts
his
skill
in
lines
interspersed
with
unintelligible
gibberish
and
restores
the
turk
to
life
in
the
version
which
used
to
be
played
throughout
scotland
at
hogmanay
the
characters
are
bol
bendo
the
king
of
france
the
king
of
spain
doctor
beelzebub
golishan
and
sir
alexander
the
fight
is
between
bol
bendo
who
represents
the
saint
george
of
the
english
version
and
golishan
the
latter
is
killed
and
on
the
demand
of
sir
alexander
who
acts
as
revived
by
the
doctor
this
character
as
in
the
english
version
interlarding
the
recital
of
his
feats
of
healing
skill
with
unintelligible
phrases
there
is
a
general
consensus
of
opinion
among
authorities
that
in
this
rough
drama
which
we
find
played
in
slightly
modified
form
all
over
europe
in
scandinavia
it
is
the
julbock
a
man
dressed
in
skins
who
after
a
dramatic
dance
is
killed
and
revived
we
have
a
symbolic
representation
of
the
death
and
of
the
year
a
counterpart
to
those
ceremonies
of
driving
out
winter
and
bringing
in
spring
which
we
have
already
described
this
chapter
had
already
been
written
when
an
important
article
by
dr
jevons
entitled
masks
and
the
origin
of
the
greek
drama
appeared
in
vol
xxvii
the
author
having
discussed
the
different
forms
of
greek
drama
and
the
variety
of
masks
employed
decides
that
greek
comedy
originated
in
harvest
festivals
in
some
ceremony
in
which
the
harvesters
went
about
in
procession
wearing
masks
this
ceremony
he
connects
directly
with
the
english
mumming
plays
suggesting
that
the
characters
represented
on
this
occasion
were
the
vegetation
spirit
and
those
who
were
concerned
in
bringing
about
his
revivification
in
fine
greek
comedy
and
the
mumming
play
both
sprang
from
the
rite
of
revivification
at
a
later
stage
of
our
enquiry
we
shall
have
occasion
to
return
to
this
point
and
realize
its
great
importance
for
our
theory
the
morris
dances
differ
somewhat
from
the
sword
and
mumming
dances
the
performances
as
a
rule
take
place
in
the
spring
or
early
summer
chiefly
may
and
whitsuntide
the
dances
retain
little
or
no
trace
of
dramatic
action
but
are
dances
pure
and
simple
the
performers
generally
six
in
number
are
attired
in
white
shirts
decked
with
ribbons
white
trousers
with
bells
at
the
knee
and
beaver
hats
adorned
with
ribbons
and
flowers
the
leader
carries
a
sword
on
the
point
of
which
is
generally
impaled
a
cake
during
the
dancing
slices
of
this
cake
are
distributed
to
the
lookers
on
who
are
supposed
to
make
a
contribution
to
the
a
carried
by
an
individual
called
the
squire
or
clown
dressed
in
motley
and
bearing
in
the
other
hand
a
stick
with
a
bladder
at
one
end
and
a
cow
tail
at
the
other
in
some
forms
of
the
dance
there
is
a
and
a
who
carry
of
office
these
maces
are
short
staves
with
a
transverse
piece
at
the
top
and
a
hoop
over
it
the
whole
is
decorated
with
ribbons
and
flowers
and
bears
a
curious
resemblance
to
the
crux
ansata
in
certain
figures
of
the
dance
the
performers
carry
handkerchiefs
in
others
wands
painted
with
the
colours
of
the
village
to
which
they
belong
the
dances
are
always
more
or
less
elaborate
in
form
the
costume
of
the
an
animal
skin
or
cap
of
skin
with
tail
pendant
and
the
special
character
assumed
by
the
maytide
celebrations
in
certain
parts
of
england
cornwall
and
staffordshire
would
seem
to
indicate
that
while
the
english
morris
dance
has
dropped
the
dramatic
action
the
dancers
not
being
designated
by
name
and
playing
no
special
rôle
it
has
on
the
other
hand
retained
the
theriomorphic
features
so
closely
associated
with
aryan
ritual
which
the
sword
dance
and
mumming
play
on
their
side
have
lost
a
special
note
of
these
english
survivals
and
one
to
which
i
would
now
draw
attention
is
the
very
elaborate
character
of
the
figures
and
the
existence
of
a
distinct
symbolic
element
i
am
informed
that
the
sword
dancers
of
always
at
the
conclusion
of
a
series
of
elaborate
figures
form
the
pentangle
as
they
hold
up
the
sign
they
cry
triumphantly
a
nut
a
nut
the
word
as
in
the
game
of
nosegays
in
may
they
do
this
often
even
when
performing
a
later
form
of
the
mumming
play
i
have
already
drawn
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
gawain
and
the
green
knight
the
hero
badge
is
the
pentangle
or
pentacle
there
explained
as
called
by
the
english
endless
knot
in
the
previous
chapter
i
have
noted
that
the
pentangle
frequently
in
the
tarot
suits
replaces
the
dish
in
mr
yeats
remarks
cited
above
the
two
are
held
to
be
interchangeable
one
or
the
other
always
forms
one
of
the
group
of
symbols
in
one
form
of
the
morris
dance
that
performed
in
berkshire
the
leader
or
of
the
morris
carries
a
chalice
at
the
same
time
he
bears
a
sword
and
a
bull
head
at
the
end
of
a
long
pole
this
figure
is
illustrated
in
miss
mary
neal
esperance
morris
book
thus
our
english
survivals
of
these
early
vegetation
ceremonies
preserve
in
a
more
or
less
detached
form
the
four
symbols
discussed
in
the
preceding
chapter
grail
sword
lance
and
pentangle
or
dish
it
seems
to
me
that
in
view
of
the
evidence
thus
offered
it
is
not
a
very
hazardous
or
hypothesis
to
suggest
that
these
symbols
the
exact
value
of
which
as
a
group
we
can
not
clearly
determine
but
of
which
we
know
the
two
most
prominent
cup
and
lance
to
be
sex
symbols
were
originally
emblems
and
as
such
employed
in
a
ritual
designed
to
promote
or
restore
the
activity
of
the
reproductive
energies
of
nature
as
i
have
pointed
out
above
an
obvious
dislocation
has
taken
place
in
our
english
survivals
sword
dance
mumming
play
and
morris
dance
no
longer
form
part
of
one
ceremony
but
have
become
separated
and
connected
on
the
one
hand
with
the
winter
on
the
other
with
the
early
summer
nature
celebrations
it
is
thus
not
surprising
that
the
symbols
should
also
have
become
detached
the
fact
that
the
three
groups
manifestly
form
part
of
an
original
whole
is
an
argument
in
favour
of
the
view
that
at
one
moment
all
the
symbols
were
used
together
and
the
grail
chalice
carried
in
a
ceremony
in
which
sword
lance
and
pentangle
were
also
displayed
but
there
is
another
point
i
would
suggest
is
it
not
possible
that
in
these
armed
youths
who
were
in
some
cases
notably
in
that
of
the
salii
at
once
warriors
and
priests
we
have
the
real
origin
of
the
grail
knights
we
know
now
absolutely
and
indubitably
that
these
sword
dances
formed
an
important
part
of
the
vegetation
ritual
is
it
not
easily
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
as
the
general
ceremonial
became
elevated
first
to
the
rank
of
a
mystery
cult
and
then
used
as
a
vehicle
for
symbolic
christian
teaching
the
figures
of
the
attendant
underwent
a
corresponding
change
from
salii
to
templars
is
not
after
all
so
a
cry
as
from
the
glittering
maruts
and
the
youthful
leaping
kouretes
to
the
grotesque
tatterdemalion
personages
of
the
christmas
mumming
play
we
have
learnt
to
acknowledge
the
common
origin
of
these
two
latter
groups
may
we
not
reasonably
contemplate
a
possible
relation
existing
between
the
two
first
named
chapter
viii
the
medicine
man
in
previous
chapters
i
have
referred
to
the
part
played
by
the
doctor
in
a
large
number
of
the
surviving
ceremonies
and
to
the
fact
noted
by
other
writers
that
even
where
an
active
share
is
no
longer
assigned
to
the
character
he
still
appears
among
the
dramatis
personae
of
these
and
processions
we
will
now
examine
more
closely
the
rôle
allotted
to
this
mysterious
personage
we
shall
find
it
to
be
of
extreme
antiquity
and
remarkable
significance
in
the
interesting
and
important
work
by
professor
von
schroeder
to
which
i
have
already
often
referred
we
find
the
translation
of
a
curious
poem
a
monologue
placed
in
the
mouth
of
a
doctor
or
medicine
man
who
vaunts
the
virtue
of
his
herbs
and
their
power
to
cure
human
ills
from
the
references
made
to
a
special
sick
man
von
schroeder
infers
that
this
poem
like
others
in
the
collection
was
intended
to
be
acted
as
well
as
recited
and
that
the
personage
to
be
healed
evidently
present
on
the
scene
was
probably
represented
by
a
dummy
as
no
speeches
are
allotted
to
the
character
the
entire
poem
consists
of
verses
of
four
lines
each
and
is
divided
by
the
translator
into
three
distinct
sections
the
first
is
devoted
to
the
praise
of
herbs
in
general
their
power
to
cure
the
sick
man
before
them
and
at
the
same
time
to
bring
riches
to
the
healer
the
opening
verses
run
die

he
then
praises
the
power
of
all
herbs

finally
the
speaker
singles
out
one
herb
as
superior
to
all
others
die

herbs
taking
counsel
together
with

their
king
answer
für

wir
a
line
which
throws
a
light
upon
the
personality
of
the
speaker
he
is
obviously
a
brahmin
and
the
medicine
man
here
as
elsewhere
unites
the
functions
of
priest
and
healer
professor
von
schroeder
suggests
that
this
dramatic
monologue
formed
part
of
the
ceremonies
of
a
soma
feast
that
it
is
the
soma
plant
from
which
the
heavenly
drink
is
brewed
which
is
to
be
understood
as
the
first
of
all
herbs
and
the
curer
of
all
ills
and
the
reference
to
soma
as
king
of
the
herbs
seems
to
bear
out
this
suggestion
in
a
previous
chapter
i
have
referred
to
a
curious
little
poem
also
found
in
the
and
translated
by
von
schroeder
under
the
title
a
at
a
the
dramatis
personae
of
the
poem
offering
as
i
pointed
out
a
most
striking
and
significant
parallel
to
certain
surviving
fertility
processions
notably
that
of
värdegötzen
in
hanover
in
this
little
song
which
von
schroeder
places
in
the
mouth
of
the
leader
of
the
band
of
maskers
the
doctor
is
twice
referred
to
in
the
opening
lines
we
have
the
brahmin
the
doctor
the
carpenter
the
smith
given
as
men
plying
different
trades
and
each
and
all
in
search
of
gain
in
the
final
verse
the
speaker
announces
i
am
a
poet
or
singer
my
father
a
doctor
thus
of
the
various
trades
and
personages
enumerated
the
doctor
alone
appears
twice
over
an
indication
of
the
importance
attached
to
this
character
unfortunately
in
view
of
the
fragmentary
condition
of
the
survivals
of
early
aryan
literature
and
the
lack
of
explanatory
material
at
our
disposal
it
is
impossible
to
decide
what
was
the
precise
rôle
assigned
to
the
man
judging
from
the
general
character
of
the
surviving
dramatic
fragments
and
the
close
parallel
which
exists
between
these
fragments
and
the
medieval
and
modern
fertility
ceremonies
it
seems
extremely
probable
that
his
original
rôle
was
identical
with
that
assigned
to
his
modern
counterpart
that
of
restoring
to
life
or
health
the
slain
or
suffering
representative
of
the
vegetation
spirit
this
presumption
gains
additional
support
from
the
fact
that
it
is
in
this
character
that
the
doctor
appears
in
greek
classical
drama
von
schroeder
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
doctor
was
a
stock
figure
in
the
greek
and
in
mr
cornford
interesting
volume
entitled
the
origin
of
attic
comedy
the
author
reckons
the
doctor
among
the
stock
masks
of
the
early
greek
theatre
and
assigns
to
this
character
the
precise
rôle
which
later
survivals
have
led
us
to
attribute
to
him
the
significance
of
mr
cornford
work
lies
in
the
fact
that
while
he
accepts
sir
gilbert
murray
deeply
interesting
and
suggestive
theory
that
the
origins
of
greek
tragedy
are
to
be
sought
in
the
agon
of
the
fertility
spirit
his
pathos
and
theophany
he
contends
that
a
similar
origin
may
be
postulated
for
attic
comedy
that
the
stock
masks
characters
agree
with
a
theory
of
derivation
of
such
comedy
from
a
ritual
performance
celebrating
the
renewal
of
the
seasons
they
were
at
first
serious
and
even
awful
figures
in
a
religious
mystery
the
god
who
every
year
is
born
and
dies
and
rises
again
his
mother
and
his
bride
the
antagonist
who
kills
him
the
medicine
man
who
restores
him
to
life
i
would
submit
that
the
presence
of
such
a
character
in
the
original
ritual
drama
of
revival
which
on
my
theory
underlies
the
romantic
form
of
the
grail
legend
may
in
view
of
the
above
evidence
and
of
that
brought
forward
in
the
previous
chapters
be
accepted
as
at
least
a
probable
hypothesis
but
it
may
be
objected
granting
that
the
doctor
in
these
fertility
processions
and
dramas
represents
a
genuine
survival
of
a
feature
of
immemorial
antiquity
a
survival
to
be
traced
alike
in
aryan
remains
in
greek
literature
and
in
medieval
ceremony
what
is
the
precise
bearing
upon
the
special
subject
of
our
investigations
there
is
no
doctor
in
the
grail
legend
although
there
is
certainly
abundant
scope
for
his
activities
there
may
be
no
doctor
in
the
grail
legend
but
was
there
never
such
a
character
how
if
this
be
the
key
to
explain
the
curious
and
persistent
attribution
of
healing
skill
to
so
apparently
unsuitable
a
personage
as
sir
gawain
i
would
draw
the
attention
of
my
readers
to
a
passage
in
the
perceval
of
chrétien
de
troyes
where
gawain
finding
a
wounded
knight
by
the
roadside
proceeds
to
treat
him

we
find
reference
to
gawain
possession
of
medical
knowledge
elsewhere
in
the
poem
entitled
lancelot
et
le
cerf
au
pied
blanc
gawain
finding
his
friend
desperately
wounded
carries
him
to
a
physician
whom
he
instructs
as
to
the
proper
treatment

the
dutch
lancelot
has
numerous
references
to
gawain
skill
in
healing
of
course
the
advocates
of
the
originality
of
chrétien
de
troyes
will
object
that
these
references
though
found
in
poems
which
have
no
connection
with
chrétien
and
which
are
translations
from
lost
french
originals
of
an
undetermined
date
are
one
and
all
loans
from
the
more
famous
poem
this
however
can
hardly
be
contended
of
the
welsh
triads
there
we
find
gwalchmai
the
welsh
gawain
cited
as
one
of
the
three
men
to
whom
the
nature
of
every
object
was
known
an
accomplishment
exceedingly
necessary
for
a
man
but
not
at
first
sight
especially
needful
for
the
equipment
of
a
knight
this
persistent
attribution
of
healing
skill
is
not
so
far
as
my
acquaintance
with
medieval
romance
goes
paralleled
in
the
case
of
any
other
knight
even
tristan
who
is
probably
the
most
accomplished
of
heroes
of
romance
the
most
thoroughly
trained
in
all
branches
of
knightly
education
is
not
credited
with
any
such
knowledge
no
other
knight
save
gawain
has
the
reputation
of
a
healer
yet
gawain
the
maidens
knight
the
father
of
nurture
is
at
first
sight
hardly
the
personage
one
might
expect
to
possess
such
skill
why
he
should
be
so
persistently
connected
with
healing
was
for
long
a
problem
to
me
recently
however
i
have
begun
to
suspect
that
we
have
in
this
apparently
motiveless
attribution
the
survival
of
an
early
stage
of
tradition
in
which
not
only
did
gawain
cure
the
grail
king
but
he
did
so
not
by
means
of
a
question
or
by
the
welding
of
a
broken
sword
but
by
more
obvious
and
natural
means
the
administration
of
a
healing
herb
gawain
character
of
healer
belongs
to
him
in
his
rôle
of
grail
winner
some
years
ago
in
the
course
of
my
reading
i
came
across
a
passage
in
which
certain
knights
of
arthur
court
riding
through
a
forest
come
upon
a
herb
belonged
to
the
grail
unfortunately
the
reference
at
the
time
i
met
with
it
though
it
struck
me
as
curious
did
not
possess
any
special
significance
and
either
i
omitted
to
make
a
note
of
it
or
entered
it
in
a
book
which
with
sundry
others
went
mysteriously
astray
in
the
process
of
moving
furniture
in
any
case
though
i
have
searched
diligently
i
have
failed
to
recover
the
passage
but
i
note
it
here
in
the
hope
that
one
of
my
reader
may
be
more
fortunate
it
is
perhaps
not
without
significance
that
a
mention
of
peredur
perceval
in
welsh
poetry
may
also
possibly
contain
a
reference
to
his
healing
office
i
refer
to
the
song
of
the
graves
in
the
black
book
of
carmarthen
where
the
grave
of
mor
son
of
peredur
penwetic
is
referred
to
according
to
dr
evans
the
word
penwedic
or
perfeddyg
as
it
may
also
be
read
means
chief
healer
peredur
it
is
needless
to
say
is
the
welsh
equivalent
of
perceval
successor
and
supplanter
in
the
rôle
of
grail
hero
i
have
no
desire
to
press
the
point
unduly
but
it
is
certainly
significant
that
entirely
apart
from
any
such
theory
of
the
evolution
of
the
grail
legend
as
that
advanced
in
these
pages
a
welsh
scholar
should
have
suggested
a
rendering
of
the
title
of
the
grail
hero
which
is
in
complete
harmony
with
that
theory
a
rendering
also
which
places
him
side
by
side
with
his
compatriot
gwalchmai
even
as
the
completely
evolved
grail
story
connects
him
with
gawain
in
any
case
there
is
food
for
reflection
in
the
fact
that
the
possibility
of
such
an
origin
once
admitted
the
most
apparently
incongruous
and
inharmonious
elements
of
the
story
show
themselves
capable
of
a
natural
and
unforced
explanation
in
face
of
the
evidence
above
set
forth
it
seems
impossible
to
deny
that
the
doctor
or
medicine
man
did
from
the
very
earliest
ages
play
an
important
part
in
dramatic
fertility
ritual
that
he
still
survives
in
the
modern
the
rude
representative
of
the
early
ritual
form
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
attribution
of
healing
skill
to
so
romantic
and
chivalrous
a
character
as
sir
gawain
may
depend
upon
the
fact
that
at
an
early
and
stage
of
his
story
he
played
the
rôle
traditionally
assigned
to
the
doctor
that
of
restoring
to
life
and
health
the
dead
or
wounded
representative
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
if
i
am
right
in
my
reading
of
this
complicated
problem
the
of
the
grail
story
was
originally
a
loan
from
a
ritual
actually
performed
and
familiar
to
those
who
first
told
the
tale
this
ritual
in
its
earlier
stages
comparatively
simple
and
objective
in
form
under
the
process
of
an
insistence
upon
the
inner
and
spiritual
significance
took
upon
itself
a
more
complex
and
esoteric
character
the
rite
became
a
mystery
and
with
this
change
the
rôle
of
the
principal
actors
became
of
heightened
significance
that
of
the
healer
could
no
longer
be
adequately
fulfilled
by
the
administration
of
a
medicinal
remedy
the
relation
of
body
and
soul
became
of
cardinal
importance
for
the
drama
the
medicine
man
gave
place
to
the
redeemer
and
his
task
involved
more
than
the
administration
of
the
original
herbal
remedy
in
fact
in
the
final
development
of
the
story
the
pathos
is
shared
alike
by
the
representative
of
the
vegetation
spirit
and
the
healer
whose
task
involves
a
period
of
stern
testing
and
probation
if
we
wish
to
understand
clearly
the
evolution
of
the
grail
story
we
must
realize
that
the
simple
fertility
drama
from
which
it
sprung
has
undergone
a
gradual
and
mysterious
change
which
has
invested
it
with
elements
at
once
and
strange
and
that
though
may
be
the
key
to
unlock
the
outer
portal
of
the
grail
castle
it
will
not
suffice
to
give
us
the
entrance
to
its
deeper
secrets
appendix
to
chapter
viii
while
having
no
connection
with
the
main
subject
of
our
study
the
grail
legend
i
should
like
to
draw
the
attention
of
students
of
medieval
literature
to
the
curious
parallel
between
the
poem
of
the
medicine
man
or
as
it
is
also
called
and
rusteboeuf
dist
de
both
are
monologues
both
presuppose
the
presence
of
an
audience
in
each
case
the
speaker
is
one
who
vaunts
his
skill
in
the
use
of
herbs
in
each
case
he
has
in
view
the
ultimate
gain
to
himself
here
are
the
opening
lines
of
the
medieval
poem
seignor
qui

has
been
long
with
the
lord
of

where
he
won
much

calabre

ai

qui

there
is
no
reference
in
the
poem
to
a
cure
about
to
be
performed
in
the
presence
of
the
audience
which
does
not
however
exclude
the
possibility
of
such
cure
being
effected
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
under
what
circumstances
such
a
poem
was
recited
whether
it
formed
part
of
a
popular
representation
the
audience
in
view
is
of
a
mixed
character
young
and
old
great
and
small
and
one
has
a
vision
of
the
quack
doctor
at
some
village
fair
on
the
platform
before
his
booth
declaiming
the
virtues
of
his
nostrums
before
an
audience
representative
of
all
ranks
and
ages
it
is
a
far
cry
from
such
a
medieval
scene
to
the
prehistoric
days
of
the
but
the
is
the
same
the
popular
feast
the
doctor
with
his
healing
herbs
which
he
vaunts
in
skilful
rhyme
the
hearers
drawn
from
all
ranks
some
credulous
some
amused
there
seems
very
little
doubt
that
both
poems
are
specimens
and
very
good
specimens
of
a
genre
the
popularity
and
vitality
of
which
are
commensurate
with
the
antiquity
of
its
origin
chapter
ix
the
fisher
king
the
gradual
process
of
our
investigation
has
led
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
elements
forming
the
existing
grail
legend
the
setting
of
the
story
the
nature
of
the
task
which
awaits
the
hero
the
symbols
and
their
significance
one
and
all
while
finding
their
counterpart
in
prehistoric
record
present
remarkable
parallels
to
the
extant
practice
and
belief
of
countries
so
widely
separate
as
the
british
isles
russia
and
central
africa
the
explanation
of
so
curious
a
fact
for
it
is
a
fact
and
not
a
mere
hypothesis
may
it
was
suggested
most
probably
be
found
in
the
theory
that
in
this
fascinating
literature
we
have
the
sometimes
partially
understood
sometimes
wholly
misinterpreted
record
of
a
ritual
originally
presumed
to
exercise
a
potency
which
at
one
time
of
universal
observance
has
even
in
its
decay
shown
itself
possessed
of
elements
of
the
most
persistent
vitality
that
if
the
ritual
which
according
to
our
theory
lies
at
the
root
of
the
grail
story
be
indeed
the
ritual
of
a
life
cult
it
should
in
and
per
se
possess
precisely
these
characteristics
will
i
think
be
admitted
by
any
critic
the
point
of
course
is
can
we
definitely
prove
our
theory
not
merely
point
to
striking
parallels
but
select
from
the
figures
and
incidents
composing
our
story
some
one
element
which
by
showing
itself
capable
of
explanation
on
this
theory
and
on
this
theory
alone
may
be
held
to
afford
decisive
proof
of
the
soundness
of
our
hypothesis
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
one
such
element
in
the
bewildering
complex
by
which
the
theory
can
be
thus
definitely
tested
that
is
the
personality
of
the
central
figure
and
the
title
by
which
he
is
known
if
we
can
prove
that
the
fisher
king
qua
fisher
king
is
an
integral
part
of
the
ritual
and
can
be
satisfactorily
explained
alike
by
its
intention
and
inherent
symbolism
we
shall
i
think
have
taken
the
final
step
which
will
establish
our
theory
upon
a
sure
basis
on
the
other
hand
if
the
fisher
king
qua
fisher
king
does
not
fit
into
our
framework
we
shall
be
forced
to
conclude
that
while
the
provenance
of
certain
elements
of
the
grail
literature
is
practically
assured
the
ensemble
has
been
complicated
by
the
introduction
of
a
terminology
which
whether
the
outcome
of
serious
intention
or
of
mere
literary
caprice
was
foreign
to
the
original
source
and
so
far
defies
explanation
in
this
latter
case
our
theory
would
not
necessarily
be
manqué
but
would
certainly
be
seriously
incomplete
we
have
already
seen
that
the
personality
of
the
king
the
nature
of
the
disability
under
which
he
is
suffering
and
the
reflex
effect
exercised
upon
his
folk
and
his
land
correspond
in
a
most
striking
manner
to
the
intimate
relation
at
one
time
held
to
exist
between
the
ruler
and
his
land
a
relation
mainly
dependent
upon
the
identification
of
the
king
with
the
divine
principle
of
life
and
fertility
this
relation
as
we
have
seen
above
exists
among
certain
african
tribes
if
we
examine
more
closely
into
the
existing
variants
of
our
romances
we
shall
find
that
those
very
variants
are
not
only
thoroughly
dans
le
cadre
of
our
proposed
solution
but
also
afford
a
valuable
and
hitherto
unsuspected
indication
of
the
relative
priority
of
the
versions
in
chapter
i
i
discussed
the
task
of
the
hero
in
general
here
i
propose
to
focus
attention
upon
his
host
and
while
in
a
measure
traversing
the
same
ground
to
do
so
with
a
view
to
determining
the
true
character
of
this
enigmatic
personage
in
the
bleheris
version
the
lord
of
the
castle
is
suffering
under
no
disability
whatever
he
is
described
as
tall
and
strong
of
limb
of
no
great
age
but
somewhat
bald
besides
the
king
there
is
a
dead
knight
upon
a
bier
over
whose
body
vespers
for
the
dead
are
solemnly
sung
the
wasting
of
the
land
partially
restored
by
gawain
question
concerning
the
lance
has
been
caused
by
the
stroke
the
stroke
which
brought
about
the
death
of
the
knight
whose
identity
is
here
never
revealed
certain
versions
which
interpolate
the
account
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
the
grail
allude
to
riche
pescheur
and
his
heirs
as
descendants
and
presumably
for
it
is
not
directly
stated
guardians
of
the
grail
but
the
king
himself
is
here
never
called
by
that
title
from
his
connection
with
the
waste
land
it
seems
more
probable
that
it
was
the
dead
knight
who
filled
that
rôle
in
the
second
version
of
which
gawain
is
the
hero
that
of
diű
crône
the
host
is
an
old
and
infirm
man
after
gawain
has
asked
the
question
we
learn
that
he
is
really
dead
and
only
compelled
to
retain
the
semblance

till
the
task
of
the
quester
be
achieved
here
again
he
is
not
called
the
fisher
king
in
the
perceval
versions
on
the
contrary
we
find
the
name
invariably
associated
with
him
but
he
is
not
always
directly
connected
with
the
misfortunes
which
have
fallen
upon
his
land
thus
while
the
wauchier
texts
are
incomplete
breaking
off
at
the
critical
moment
of
asking
the
question
manessier
who
continues
and
ostensibly
completes
wauchier
introduces
the
dead
knight
here
goondesert
or
gondefer
which
i
suspect
is
the
more
correct
form
brother
of
the
king
whose
death
by
treachery
has
plunged
the
land
in
misery
and
been
the
direct
cause
of
the
of
the
king
the
healing
of
the
king
and
the
restoration
of
the
land
depend
upon
perceval
slaying
the
murderer
partinal
these
two
versions
show
a
combination
of
perceval
and
gawain
themes
such
as
their
respective
dates
might
lead
us
to
expect
robert
de
borron
is
the
only
writer
who
gives
a
clear
and
tolerably
reasonable
account
of
why
the
guardian
of
the
grail
bears
the
title
of
fisher
king
in
other
cases
such
as
the
poems
of
chrétien
and
wolfram
the
name
is
connected
with
his
partiality
for
fishing
an
obviously
post
hoc
addition
the
story
in
question
is
found
in
borron
joseph
of
arimathea
here
we
are
told
how
during
the
wanderings
of
that
holy
man
and
his
companions
in
the
wilderness
certain
of
the
company
fell
into
sin
by
the
command
of
god
brons
joseph
caught
a
fish
which
with
the
grail
provided
a
mystic
meal
of
which
the
unworthy
can
not
partake
thus
the
sinners
were
separated
from
the
righteous
henceforward
brons
was
known
as
rich
fisher
it
is
noteworthy
however
that
in
the
perceval
romance
ascribed
to
borron
the
title
is
as
a
rule
roi
pescheur
not
riche
pescheur
in
this
romance
the
king
is
not
suffering
from
any
special
malady
but
is
the
victim
of
extreme
old
age
not
surprising
as
he
is
brons
himself
who
has
survived
from
the
dawn
of
christianity
to
the
days
of
king
arthur
we
are
told
that
the
effect
of
asking
the
question
will
be
to
restore
him
to
youth
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
appears
to
bring
about
his
death
as
he
only
lives
three
days
after
his
restoration
when
we
come
to
chrétien
poem
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
a
striking
alteration
in
the
presentment
there
are
not
one
but
two
disabled
kings
one
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
wound
the
other
in
extreme
old
age
chrétien
poem
being
incomplete
we
do
not
know
what
he
intended
to
be
the
result
of
the
achieved
quest
but
we
may
i
think
reasonably
conclude
that
the
wounded
king
at
least
was
healed
the
parzival
of
von
eschenbach
follows
the
same
tradition
but
is
happily
complete
here
we
find
the
wounded
king
was
healed
but
what
becomes
of
the
aged
man
here
the
grandfather
not
as
in
chrétien
the
father
of
the
fisher
king
we
are
not
told
the
perlesvaus
is
as
i
have
noted
above
very
unsatisfactory
the
illness
of
the
king
is
badly
motivated
and
he
dies
before
the
achievement
of
the
quest
this
romance
while
retaining
certain
interesting
and
undoubtedly
primitive
features
is
as
a
whole
too
late
and
remaniée
a
redaction
to
be
of
much
use
in
determining
the
question
of
origins
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
grand
saint
graal
and
queste
versions
both
of
which
are
too
closely
connected
with
the
prose
lancelot
and
too
obviously
intended
to
develope
and
complete
the
données
of
that
romance
to
be
relied
upon
as
evidence
for
the
original
form
of
the
grail
legend
the
version
of
the
queste
is
very
confused
there
are
two
kings
at
the
grail
castle
pelles
and
his
father
sometimes
the
one
sometimes
the
other
bears
the
title
of
roi
pescheur
there
is
besides
an
extremely
old
and
desperately
wounded
king
mordrains
a
contemporary
of
joseph
who
practically
belongs
not
to
the
grail
tradition
but
to
a
conversion
legend
embodied
in
the
grand
saint
graal
finally
in
the
latest
cyclic
texts
we
have
three
kings
all
of
whom
are
wounded
the
above
will
show
that
the
presentment
of
this
central
figure
is
much
confused
generally
termed
le
roi
pescheur
he
is
sometimes
described
as
in
middle
life
and
in
full
possession
of
his
bodily
powers
sometimes
while
still
comparatively
young
he
is
incapacitated
by
the
effects
of
a
wound
and
is
known
also
by
the
title
of
roi
mehaigné
or
maimed
king
sometimes
he
is
in
extreme
old
age
and
in
certain
closely
connected
versions
the
two
ideas
are
combined
and
we
have
a
wounded
fisher
king
and
an
aged
father
or
grandfather
but
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
significant
fact
that
in
no
case
is
the
fisher
king
a
youthful
character
that
distinction
is
reserved
for
his
healer
and
successor
now
is
it
possible
to
arrive
at
any
conclusion
as
to
the
relative
value
and
probable
order
of
these
conflicting
variants
i
think
that
if
we
admit
that
they
do
in
all
probability
represent
a
more
or
less
coherent
survival
of
the
nature
ritual
previously
discussed
we
may
by
help
of
what
we
know
as
to
the
varying
forms
of
that
ritual
be
enabled
to
bring
some
order
out
of
this
confusion
if
we
turn
back
to
chapters
and
and
consult
the
evidence
there
given
as
to
the
adonis
cults
the
spring
festivals
of
european
folk
the
mumming
plays
of
the
british
isles
the
main
fact
that
emerges
is
that
in
the
great
majority
of
these
cases
the
representative
of
the
spirit
of
vegetation
is
considered
as
dead
and
the
object
of
these
ceremonies
is
to
restore
him
to
life
this
i
hold
to
be
the
primary
form
this
section
had
already
been
written
when
i
came
across
the
important
article
by
dr
jevons
referred
to
in
a
previous
chapter
certain
of
his
remarks
are
here
so
much
to
the
point
that
i
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
them
speaking
of
the
mumming
plays
the
writer
says
the
one
point
in
which
there
is
no
variation
is
that
the
character
is
killed
and
brought
to
life
again
the
play
is
a
ceremonial
performance
or
rather
it
is
the
development
in
dramatic
form
of
what
was
originally
a
religious
or
magical
rite
representing
or
realizing
the
revivification
of
the
character
slain
this
revivification
is
the
one
essential
and
invariable
feature
of
all
the
mummer
plays
in
england
in
certain
cases
the
famous
roman
spring
festival
of
mamurius
veturius
and
the
swabian
ceremony
referred
to
above
the
central
figure
is
an
old
man
in
no
case
do
i
find
that
the
representative
of
vegetation
is
merely
wounded
although
the
nature
of
the
ritual
would
obviously
admit
of
such
a
variant
thus
taking
the
extant
and
recognized
forms
of
the
ritual
into
consideration
we
might
expect
to
find
that
in
the
earliest
and
least
contaminated
version
of
the
grail
story
the
central
figure
would
be
dead
and
the
task
of
the
quester
that
of
restoring
him
to
life
viewed
from
this
standpoint
the
gawain
versions
the
priority
of
which
is
maintainable
upon
strictly
literary
grounds
gawain
being
the
original
arthurian
romantic
hero
are
of
extraordinary
interest
in
the
one
form
we
find
a
dead
knight
whose
fate
is
distinctly
stated
to
have
involved
his
land
in
desolation
in
the
other
an
aged
man
who
while
preserving
the
semblance
of
life
is
in
reality
dead
this
last
version
appears
to
me
in
view
of
our
present
knowledge
to
be
of
extreme
critical
value
there
can
i
think
be
little
doubt
that
in
the
primary
form
underlying
our
extant
versions
the
king
was
dead
and
restored
to
life
at
first
i
strongly
suspect
by
the
agency
of
some
mysterious
herb
or
herbs
a
feature
retained
in
certain
forms
of
the
mumming
play
in
the
next
stage
that
represented
by
borron
he
is
suffering
from
extreme
old
age
and
the
task
of
the
quester
is
to
restore
him
to
youth
this
version
is
again
supported
by
extant
parallels
in
each
of
these
cases
it
seems
most
probable
that
the
original
ritual
i
should
wish
it
to
be
clearly
understood
that
i
hold
the
grail
story
to
have
been
primarily
dramatic
and
actually
performed
involved
an
act
of
substitution
the
dead
king
in
the
first
case
being
probably
represented
by
a
mere
effigy
in
the
second
being
an
old
man
his
place
was
at
a
given
moment
of
the
ritual
taken
by
the
youth
who
played
the
rôle
of
the
quester
it
is
noteworthy
that
while
both
perceval
and
galahad
are
represented
as
mere
lads
gawain
whatever
his
age
at
the
moment
of
the
grail
quest
was
as
we
learn
from
diű
crône
dowered
by
his
fairy
mistress
with
the
gift
of
eternal
youth
the
versions
of
chrétien
and
wolfram
which
present
us
with
a
wounded
fisher
king
and
a
father
or
grandfather
in
extreme
old
age
are
due
in
my
opinion
to
a
literary
device
intended
to
combine
two
existing
variants
that
the
subject
matter
was
well
understood
by
the
original
redactor
of
the
common
source
is
proved
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
but
i
hold
that
in
these
versions
we
have
passed
from
the
domain
of
ritual
to
that
of
literature
still
we
have
a
curious
indication
that
the
wounding
variant
may
have
had
its
place
in
the
former
the
suggestion
made
above
as
to
the
probable
existence
in
the
primitive
ritual
of
a
substitution
ceremony
seems
to
me
to
provide
a
possible
explanation
of
the
feature
found
alike
in
wolfram
and
in
the
closely
allied
grail
section
of
sone
de
nansai
that
the
wound
of
the
king
was
a
punishment
for
sin
he
had
conceived
a
passion
for
a
pagan
princess
now
there
would
be
no
incongruity
in
representing
the
dead
king
as
reborn
in
youthful
form
the
aged
king
as
revenu
dans
sa
juvence
but
when
the
central
figure
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
some
reason
had
to
be
found
his
strength
and
vitality
being
restored
for
his
supersession
by
the
appointed
healer
this
supersession
was
adequately
motivated
by
the
supposed
transgression
of
a
fundamental
christian
law
entailing
as
consequence
the
forfeiture
of
his
crown
i
would
thus
separate
the
doubling
theme
as
found
in
chrétien
and
wolfram
from
the
wounded
theme
equally
common
to
these
poets
this
latter
might
possibly
be
accounted
for
on
the
ground
of
a
ritual
variant
the
first
is
purely
literary
explicable
neither
on
the
exoteric
nor
the
esoteric
aspect
of
the
ceremony
from
the
exoteric
point
of
view
there
are
not
and
there
can
not
be
two
kings
suffering
from
parallel
disability
the
ritual
knows
one
principle
of
life
and
one
alone
equally
from
the
esoteric
standpoint
fisher
king
and
maimed
king
representing
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
personality
may
and
probably
were
represented
as
two
individuals
but
one
alone
is
disabled
further
as
the
two
are
in
very
truth
one
they
should
be
equals
in
age
not
of
different
generations
thus
the
bleheris
version
which
gives
us
a
dead
knight
presumably
from
his
having
been
slain
in
battle
still
in
vigorous
manhood
and
a
hale
king
is
ritually
the
more
correct
the
original
of
manessier
version
must
have
been
similar
but
the
fact
that
by
the
time
it
was
compiled
the
fisher
king
was
generally
accepted
as
being
also
the
maimed
king
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
very
awkward
and
poorly
motivated
incident
it
will
be
noted
that
in
this
case
the
king
is
not
healed
either
at
the
moment
of
the
slaying
of
his
brother
murderer
which
would
be
the
logical
result
of
the
données
of
the
tale
nor
at
the
moment
of
contact
with
the
successful
quester
but
at
the
mere
announcement
of
his
approach
thus
if
we
consider
the
king
apart
from
his
title
we
find
that
alike
from
his
position
in
the
story
his
close
connection
with
the
fortunes
of
his
land
and
people
and
the
varying
forms
of
the
disability
of
which
he
is
the
victim
he
corresponds
with
remarkable
exactitude
to
the
central
figure
of
a
nature
ritual
and
may
therefore
justly
be
claimed
to
belong
ab
origine
to
such
a
hypothetical
source
but
what
about
his
title
why
should
he
be
called
the
fisher
king
here
we
strike
what
i
hold
to
be
the
main
crux
of
the
problem
a
feature
upon
which
scholars
have
expended
much
thought
and
ingenuity
a
feature
which
the
authors
of
the
romances
themselves
either
did
not
always
understand
or
were
at
pains
to
obscure
by
the
introduction
of
the
obviously
post
hoc
motif
above
referred
to
that
he
was
called
the
fisher
king
because
of
his
devotion
to
the
pastime
of
fishing
of
which
heinzel
sensibly
remarks
that
the
story
of
the
fisher
king
presupposes
a
legend
of
this
personage
only
vaguely
known
and
remembered
by
chrétien
practically
the
interpretations
already
attempted
fall
into
two
main
groups
which
we
may
designate
as
the
and
the
interpretations
for
those
who
hold
that
the
grail
story
is
essentially
and
fundamentally
christian
finding
its
root
in
eucharistic
symbolism
the
title
is
naturally
connected
with
the
use
of
the
fish
symbol
in
early
christianity
the
icthys
anagram
as
applied
to
christ
the
title
of
men
bestowed
upon
the
apostles
the
papal
ring
of
the
fisherman
though
it
must
be
noted
that
no
manipulation
of
the
christian
symbolism
avails
satisfactorily
to
account
for
the
lamentable
condition
into
which
the
bearer
of
the
title
has
fallen
the
advocates
of
the
theory
on
the
other
hand
practically
evade
this
main
difficulty
by
basing
their
interpretation
upon
borron
story
of
the
catching
of
the
fish
by
brons
equating
this
character
with
the
bran
of
welsh
tradition
and
pointing
to
the
existence
in
irish
and
welsh
legend
of
a
salmon
of
wisdom
the
tasting
of
whose
flesh
confers
all
knowledge
hertz
acutely
remarks
that
the
incident
as
related
by
borron
is
not
of
such
importance
as
to
justify
the
stress
laid
upon
the
name
rich
fisher
by
later
writers
we
may
also
note
in
this
connection
that
the
grail
romances
never
employ
the
form
fisher
which
if
the
origin
of
the
name
were
that
proposed
above
we
might
reasonably
expect
to
find
it
is
obvious
that
a
satisfactory
solution
of
the
problem
must
be
sought
elsewhere
in
my
opinion
the
key
to
the
puzzle
is
to
be
found
in
the
rightful
understanding
of
the
symbolism
students
of
the
grail
literature
have
been
too
prone
to
treat
the
question
on
the
christian
basis
alone
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
christianity
did
no
more
than
take
over
and
adapt
to
its
own
use
a
symbolism
already
endowed
with
a
deeply
rooted
prestige
and
importance
so
far
the
subject
can
not
be
said
to
have
received
adequate
treatment
certain
of
its
aspects
have
been
more
or
less
fully
discussed
in
monographs
and
isolated
articles
but
we
still
await
a
comprehensive
study
on
this
most
important
question
so
far
as
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
goes
we
can
affirm
with
certainty
that
the
fish
is
a
life
symbol
of
immemorial
antiquity
and
that
the
title
of
fisher
has
from
the
earliest
ages
been
associated
with
deities
who
were
held
to
be
specially
connected
with
the
origin
and
preservation
of
life
in
indian
cosmogony
manu

the
fish
and
fisher
are
freely
employed
thus
in
buddhist
monasteries
we
find
drums
and
gongs
in
the
shape
of
a
fish
but
the
true
meaning
of
the
symbol
while
still
regarded
as
sacred
has
been
lost
and
the
explanations
like
the
explanations
of
the
grail
romances
are
often
fantastic
afterthoughts
in
the
mahayana
scriptures
buddha
is
referred
to
as
the
fisherman
who
draws
fish
from
the
ocean
of
samsara
to
the
light
of
salvation
there
are
figures
and
pictures
which
represent
buddha
in
the
act
of
fishing
an
attitude
which
unless
interpreted
in
a
symbolic
sense
would
be
utterly
at
variance
with
the
tenets
of
the
buddhist
religion
this
also
holds
good
for
chinese
buddhism
the
goddess
kwanyin
the
female
deity
of
mercy
and
salvation
is
depicted
either
on
or
holding
a
fish
in
the
han
palace
of
there
was
a
fish
carved
in
jade
to
which
in
time
of
drought
sacrifices
were
offered
the
prayers
being
always
answered
both
in
india
and
china
the
fish
is
employed
in
funeral
rites
in
india
a
crystal
bowl
with
fish
handles
was
found
in
a
reputed
tomb
of
buddha
in
china
the
symbol
is
found
on
stone
slabs
enclosing
the
coffin
on
bronze
urns
vases
etc
even
as
the
babylonians
had
the
fish
or
fisher
god
oannes
who
revealed
to
them
the
arts
of
writing
agriculture
and
was
as
eisler
puts
it
and
lord
of
all
wisdom
so
the
chinese
who
is
pictured
with
the
mystic
tablets
containing
the
mysteries
of
heaven
and
earth
is
with
his
consort
and
retinue
represented
as
having
a
fish
tail
the
writer
of
the
article
in
the
open
court
asserts
that
the
fish
was
sacred
to
those
deities
who
were
supposed
to
lead
men
back
from
the
shadows
of
death
to
life
if
this
be
really
the
case
we
can
understand
the
connection
of
the
symbol
first
with
orpheus
later
with
christ
as
eisler
remarks
orpheus
is
connected
with
nearly
all
the
mystery
and
a
great
many
of
the
ordinary
chthonic
cults
in
greece
and
italy
christianity
took
its
first
tentative
steps
into
the
reluctant
world
of
paganism
under
the
benevolent
patronage
of
orpheus
there
is
thus
little
reason
to
doubt
that
if
we
regard
the
fish
as
a
divine
life
symbol
of
immemorial
antiquity
we
shall
not
go
very
far
astray
we
may
note
here
that
there
was
a
fish
known
to
the
semites
by
the
name
of
adonis
although
as
the
title
signifies
and
is
generic
rather
than
specific
too
much
stress
can
not
be
laid
upon
it
it
is
more
interesting
to
know
that
in
babylonian
cosmology
adapa
the
wise
the
son
of
ea
is
represented
as
a
fisher
in
the
ancient
sumerian
laments
for
tammuz
previously
referred
to
that
god
is
frequently
addressed
as
divine
lamgar
lord
of
the
net
the
nearest
equivalent
i
have
so
far
found
to
our
king
whether
the
phrase
is
here
used
in
an
actual
or
a
symbolic
sense
the
connection
of
idea
is
sufficiently
striking
in
the
opinion
of
the
most
recent
writers
on
the
subject
the
christian
fish
symbolism
derives
directly
from
the
jewish
the
jews
on
their
side
having
borrowed
freely
from
syrian
belief
and
practice
what
may
be
regarded
as
the
central
point
of
jewish
fish
symbolism
is
the
tradition
that
at
the
end
of
the
world
messias
will
catch
the
great
fish
leviathan
and
divide
its
flesh
as
food
among
the
faithful
as
a
foreshadowing
of
this
messianic
feast
the
jews
were
in
the
habit
of
eating
fish
upon
the
sabbath
during
the
captivity
under
the
influence
of
the
worship
of
the
goddess
atargatis
they
transferred
the
ceremony
to
the
friday
the
eve
of
the
sabbath
a
position
which
it
has
retained
to
the
present
day
eisler
remarks
that
in
galicia
one
can
see
israelite
families
in
spite
of
their
being
reduced
to
the
extremest
misery
procuring
on
fridays
a
single
gudgeon
to
eat
divided
into
fragments
at
in
the
century
rabbi
solomon
luria
protested
strongly
against
this
practice
fish
he
declared
should
be
eaten
on
the
sabbath
itself
not
on
the
eve
this
jewish
custom
appears
to
have
been
adopted
by
the
primitive
church
and
early
christians
on
their
side
celebrated
a
sacramental
the
catacombs
supply
us
with
numerous
illustrations
fully
described
by
the
two
writers
referred
to
the
elements
of
this
mystic
meal
were
fish
bread
and
wine
the
last
being
represented
in
the
messianic
tradition
at
the
end
of
the
meal
god
will
give
to
the
most
worthy
to
king
david
the
cup
of
blessing
one
of
fabulous
dimensions
fish
play
an
important
part
in
mystery
cults
as
being
the
food
upon
a
tablet
dedicated
to
the
phrygian
mater
magna
we
find
fish
and
cup
and
dölger
speaking
of
a
votive
tablet
discovered
in
the
balkans
says
hier
ist
der
fisch

und

wieder
allzu
deutlich
als
die

now
i
would
submit
that
here
and
not
in
celtic
is
to
be
found
the
source
of
borron
let
us
consider
the
circumstances
joseph
and
his
followers
in
the
course
of
their
wanderings
find
themselves
in
danger
of
famine
the
position
is
somewhat
curious
as
apparently
the
leaders
have
no
idea
of
the
condition
of
their
followers
till
the
latter
appeal
to
brons
brons
informs
joseph
who
prays
for
aid
and
counsel
from
the
grail
a
voice
from
heaven
bids
him
send
his
brons
to
catch
a
fish
meanwhile
he
joseph
is
to
prepare
a
table
set
the
grail
covered
with
a
cloth
in
the
centre
opposite
his
own
seat
and
the
fish
which
brons
shall
catch
on
the
other
side
he
does
this
and
the
seats
are
filled
si
asieent
une
grant
partie
et
plus
i
ot
de
cels
qui
sistrent
mie
que
de
cels
qui

those
who
are
seated
at
the
table
are
conscious
of
a
great
douceur
and
de
lor
cuers
the
rest
feel
nothing
now
compare
this
with
the
irish
story
of
the
salmon
of
wisdom
finn
mac
cumhail
enters
the
service
of
his
namesake
finn
eger
who
for
seven
years
had
remained
by
the
boyne
watching
the
salmon
of
lynn
feic
which
it
had
been
foretold
finn
should
catch
the
younger
lad
who
conceals
his
name
catches
the
fish
he
is
set
to
watch
it
while
it
roasts
but
is
warned
not
to
eat
it
touching
it
with
his
thumb
he
is
burned
and
puts
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
to
cool
it
immediately
he
becomes
possessed
of
all
knowledge
and
thereafter
has
only
to
chew
his
thumb
to
obtain
wisdom
mr
nutt
remarks
the
incident
in
borron
poem
has
been
recast
in
the
mould
of
mediaeval
christian
symbolism
but
i
think
the
older
myth
can
still
be
clearly
discerned
and
is
wholly
responsible
for
the
incident
as
found
in
the
conte
du
graal
but
when
these
words
were
written
we
were
in
ignorance
of
the
sacramental
common
alike
to
jewish
christian
and
mystery
cults
a
meal
which
offers
a
far
closer
parallel
to
borron
romance
than
does
the
finn
story
in
which
beyond
the
catching
of
a
fish
there
is
absolutely
no
point
of
contact
with
our
romance
neither
joseph
nor
brons
derives
wisdom
from
the
eating
thereof
it
is
not
they
who
detect
the
sinners
the
severance
between
the
good
and
the
evil
is
brought
about
automatically
the
finn
story
has
no
common
meal
and
no
idea
of
spiritual
blessings
such
as
are
connected
therewith
in
the
case
of
the
messianic
on
the
other
hand
the
parallel
is
striking
in
both
cases
it
is
a
communal
meal
in
both
cases
the
privilege
of
sharing
it
is
the
reward
of
the
faithful
in
both
cases
it
is
a
foretaste
of
the
bliss
of
paradise
furthermore
as
remarked
above
the
practice
was
at
one
time
of
very
widespread
prevalence
now
whence
did
borron
derive
his
knowledge
from
jewish
christian
or
mystery
sources
this
is
a
question
not
very
easy
to
decide
in
view
of
the
pronounced
christian
tone
of
borron
romance
i
should
feel
inclined
to
exclude
the
first
also
the
jewish
seems
to
have
been
of
a
more
open
general
and
less
symbolic
character
than
the
christian
it
was
frankly
an
anticipation
of
a
promised
future
bliss
obtainable
by
all
orthodox
christianity
on
the
other
hand
knows
nothing
of
the
sacred
so
far
as
i
am
aware
it
forms
no
part
of
any
apocalyptic
expectation
and
where
this
special
symbolism
does
occur
it
is
often
under
conditions
which
place
its
interpretation
outside
the
recognized
category
of
christian
belief
a
noted
instance
in
point
is
the
famous
epitaph
of
bishop
aberkios
over
the
correct
interpretation
of
which
scholars
have
spent
much
time
and
ingenuity
in
this
curious
text
aberkios
after
mentioning
his
journeys
says
paul
i
had
as
my
guide
faith
however
always
went
ahead
and
set
before
me
as
food
a
fish
from
a
fountain
a
huge
one
a
clean
one
which
a
holy
virgin
has
caught
this
she
gave
to
the
friends
ever
to
eat
as
food
having
good
wine
and
offering
it
watered
together
with
bread
aberkios
had
this
engraved
when
years
of
age
in
truth
whoever
can
understand
this
let
him
pray
for
aberkios
eisler
i
am
here
quoting
from
the
quest
article
remarks
as
the
last
line
of
our
quotation
gives
us
quite
plainly
to
understand
a
number
of
words
which
we
have
italicized
are
obviously
used
in
an
unusual
metaphorical
sense
that
is
to
say
as
terms
of
the
christian
mystery
language
while
harnack
admitting
that
the
christian
character
of
the
text
is
indisputable
adds
significantly
aber
das
christentum
der
grosskirche
ist
es
nicht
thus
it
is
possible
that
to
the
various
points
of
doubtful
orthodoxy
which
scholars
have
noted
as
characteristic
of
the
grail
romances
borron
should
also
be
added
should
it
be
objected
that
the
dependence
of
a
medieval
romance
upon
a
jewish
tradition
of
such
antiquity
is
scarcely
probable
i
would
draw
attention
to
the
voyage
of
saint
brandan
where
the
monks
during
their
prolonged
wanderings
annually
their
resurrection
celebrate
their
easter
mass
on
the
back
of
a
great
fish
on
their
first
meeting
with
this
monster
saint
brandan
tells
them
it
is
the
greatest
of
all
fishes
and
is
named
jastoni
a
name
which
bears
a
curious
resemblance
to
the
jhasa
of
the
indian
tradition
cited
above
in
this
last
instance
the
connection
of
the
fish
with
life
renewed
and
sustained
is
undeniable
the
original
source
of
such
a
symbol
is
most
probably
to
be
found
in
the
belief
referred
to
in
a
previous
chapter
that
all
life
comes
from
the
water
but
that
a
more
sensual
and
less
abstract
idea
was
also
operative
appears
from
the
close
connection
of
the
fish
with
the
goddess
astarte
or
atargatis
a
connection
here
shared
by
the
dove
cumont
in
his
les
religions
orientales
dans
le
paganisme
romain
says
two
animals
were
held
in
general
reverence
namely
dove
and
fish
countless
flocks
of
doves
greeted
the
traveller
when
he
stepped
on
shore
at
askalon
and
in
the
outer
courts
of
all
the
temples
of
astarte
one
might
see
the
flutter
of
their
white
wings
the
fish
were
preserved
in
ponds
near
to
the
temple
and
superstitious
dread
forbade
their
capture
for
the
goddess
punished
such
sacrilege
smiting
the
offender
with
ulcers
and
tumours
but
at
certain
mystic
banquets
priests
and
initiates
partook
of
this
otherwise
forbidden
food
in
the
belief
that
they
thus
partook
of
the
flesh
of
the
goddess
eisler
and
other
scholars
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
the
familiarity
with
this
ritual
gained
by
the
jews
during
the
captivity
that
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
friday
already
referred
to
friday
being
the
day
dedicated
to
the
goddess
and
later
to
her
equivalent
venus
from
the
jews
the
custom
spread
to
the
christian
church
where
it
still
flourishes
its
true
origin
it
is
needless
to
say
being
wholly
unsuspected
dove
and
fish
also
appear
together
in
ancient
iconography
in
comte
goblet
work
the
migration
of
symbols
there
is
an
illustration
of
a
coin
of
cyzicus
on
which
is
represented
an
omphalus
flanked
by
two
doves
with
a
fish
beneath
and
a
whole
section
is
devoted
to
the
discussion
of
the
representations
of
two
doves
on
either
side
of
a
temple
entrance
or
of
an
omphalus
in
the
author
opinion
the
origin
of
the
symbol
may
be
found
in
the
sacred
of
phoenicia
referred
to
by
cumont
scheftelowitz
instances
the
combination
of
and
dove
found
on
a
jewish
tomb
of
the
first
century
at
syracuse
and
remarks
that
the
two
are
frequently
found
in
combination
on
christian
tombstones
students
of
the
grail
romances
will
not
need
to
be
reminded
that
the
dove
makes
its
appearance
in
certain
of
our
texts
in
the
parzival
it
plays
a
somewhat
important
rôle
every
good
friday
a
dove
brings
from
heaven
a
host
which
it
lays
upon
the
grail
and
the
dove
is
the
badge
of
the
grail
knights
in
the
prose
lancelot
the
coming
of
the
grail
procession
is
heralded
by
the
entrance
through
the
window
of
a
dove
bearing
a
censer
in
its
beak
is
it
not
possible
that
it
was
the
already
existing
connection
in
nature
ritual
of
these
two
dove
and
fish
which
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
former
into
our
romances
where
its
rôle
is
never
really
adequately
motivated
it
is
further
to
be
noted
that
besides
dove
and
fish
the
syrians
reverenced
stones
more
especially
meteoric
stones
which
they
held
to
be
endowed
with
life
potency
another
point
of
contact
with
our
romances
that
the
fish
was
considered
a
potent
factor
in
ensuring
fruitfulness
is
proved
by
certain
prehistoric
tablets
described
by
scheftelowitz
where
fish
horse
and
swastika
or
in
another
instance
fish
and
reindeer
are
found
in
a
combination
which
unmistakeably
denotes
that
the
object
of
the
votive
tablet
was
to
ensure
the
fruitfulness
of
flocks
and
herds
with
this
intention
its
influence
was
also
invoked
in
marriage
ceremonies
the
same
writer
points
out
that
the
jews
in
poland
were
accustomed
to
hold
a
fish
feast
immediately
on
the
conclusion
of
the
marriage
ceremony
and
that
a
similar
practice
can
be
prove
for
the
ancient
greeks
at
the
present
day
the
jews
of
tunis
exhibit
a
fish
tail
on
a
cushion
at
their
weddings
in
some
parts
of
india
the
pair
waded
into
the
water
and
caught
fish
in
a
new
garment
during
the
ceremony
a
brahmin
student
from
the
shore
asked
solemnly
what
seest
thou
to
which
the
answer
was
returned
sons
and
cattle
in
all
these
cases
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
prolific
nature
of
the
fish
a
feature
which
it
shares
in
common
with
the
dove
which
inspired
practice
and
intention
surely
the
effect
of
this
cumulative
body
of
evidence
is
to
justify
us
in
the
belief
that
fish
and
fisher
being
as
they
undoubtedly
are
life
symbols
of
immemorial
antiquity
are
by
virtue
of
their
origin
entirely
in
their
place
in
a
sequence
of
incidents
which
there
is
solid
ground
for
believing
derive
ultimately
from
a
cult
of
this
nature
that
borron
that
the
title
of
fisher
king
are
not
accidents
of
literary
invention
but
genuine
and
integral
parts
of
the
common
body
of
tradition
which
has
furnished
the
incidents
and
of
the
grail
drama
can
it
be
denied
that
while
from
the
standpoint
of
a
christian
interpretation
the
character
of
the
fisher
king
is
simply
incomprehensible
from
the
standpoint
of
inadequately
explained
from
that
of
a
ritual
survival
it
assumes
a
profound
meaning
and
significance
he
is
not
merely
a
deeply
symbolic
figure
but
the
essential
centre
of
the
whole
cult
a
being
standing
between
his
people
and
land
and
the
unseen
forces
which
control
their
destiny
if
the
grail
story
be
based
upon
a
life
ritual
the
character
of
the
fisher
king
is
of
the
very
essence
of
the
tale
and
his
title
so
far
from
being
meaningless
expresses
for
those
who
are
at
pains
to
seek
the
intention
and
object

the

students
of
the

literature
can
not
fail
to
have
been
impressed
by
a
certain
atmosphere
of
awe
and
mystery
which
surrounds
that
enigmatic
vessel
there
is
a
secret
connected
with
it
the
revelation
of
which
will
entail
dire
misfortune
on
the

if
spoken
of
at
all
it
must
be
with
scrupulous
accuracy
it
is

secret
a
thing
that
no

or
maid
may
venture
to
speak
of
it
a

or

might
indeed
tell

of

none
can
hearken
to
the

without

from
this
evidence
there
is
no
doubt
that
to
the
romance
writers
the
grail
was
something
secret
mysterious
and
awful
the
exact
knowledge
of
which
was
reserved
to
a
select
few
and
which
was
only
to
be
spoken
of
with
bated
breath
and
a
careful
regard
to
strict
accuracy
but
how
does
this
agree
with
the
evidence
set
forth
in
our
preceding
chapters
there
we
have
been
led
rather
to
emphasize
the
close
parallels
existing
between
the
characters
and
incidents
of
the
grail
story
and
a
certain
group
of
popular
beliefs
and
observances
now
very
generally
recognized
as
fragments
of
a
once
widespread
nature
cult
these
beliefs
and
observances
while
dating
from
remotest
antiquity
have
in
their
modern
survivals
of
recent
years
attracted
the
attention
of
scholars
by
their
persistent
and
pervasive
character
and
their
enduring
vitality
yet
so
far
as
we
have
hitherto
dealt
with
them
these
practices
were
and
are
popular
in
character
openly
performed
and
devoid
of
the
special
element
of
mystery
which
is
so
characteristic
a
feature
of
the
grail
nor
in
these
public
these
spring
festivals
dances
and
plays
is
there
anything
which
on
the
face
of
it
appears
to
bring
them
into
touch
with
the
central
mystery
of
the
christian
faith
yet
the
men
who
wrote
these
romances
saw
no
incongruity
in
identifying
the
mysterious
vessel
of
the
version
with
the
chalice
of
the
eucharist
and
in
ascribing
the
power
of
bestowing
spiritual
life
to
that
which
certain
modern
scholars
have
identified
as
a
a
vessel
of
plenty
if
there
be
a
mystery
of
the
grail
surely
the
mystery
lies
here
in
the
possibility
of
identifying
two
objects
which
apparently
lie
at
the
very
opposite
poles
of
intellectual
conception
what
brought
them
together
where
shall
we
seek
a
connecting
link
by
what
road
did
the
romancers
reach
so
strangely
unexpected
a
goal
it
is
of
course
very
generally
recognized
that
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
religions
upon
the
nature
and
character
of
whose
rites
we
possess
reliable
information
such
rites
possessed
a
character
exoteric
in
celebrations
openly
and
publicly
performed
in
which
all
adherents
of
that
particular
cult
could
join
freely
the
object
of
such
public
rites
being
to
obtain
some
external
and
material
benefit
whether
for
the
individual
worshipper
or
for
the
community
as
a
whole
esoteric
rites
open
only
to
a
favoured
few
the
initiates
the
object
of
which
appears
as
a
rule
to
have
been
individual
rather
than
social
and
in
some
cases
certainly
the
object
aimed
at
was
the
attainment
of
a
conscious
ecstatic
union
with
the
god
and
the
definite
assurance
of
a
future
life
in
other
words
there
was
the
public
worship
and
there
were
the
mysteries
of
late
years
there
has
been
a
growing
tendency
among
scholars
to
seek
in
the
mysteries
the
clue
which
shall
enable
us
to
read
aright
the
baffling
riddle
of
the
grail
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
so
doing
we
are
on
the
right
path
at
the
same
time
i
am
convinced
that
to
seek
that
clue
in
those
mysteries
which
are
at
once
the
most
famous
and
the
most
familiar
to
the
classical
scholar
the
eleusinian
is
a
fatal
mistake
there
are
as
we
shall
see
certain
essential
and
radical
differences
between
the
greek
and
the
christian
religious
conceptions
which
affecting
as
they
do
the
root
conceptions
of
the
two
groups
render
it
quite
impossible
that
any
form
of
the
eleusinian
mystery
cult
could
have
given
such
results
as
we
find
in
the
grail
legend
cumont
in
his
les
religions
orientales
dans
le
paganisme
romain
speaking
of
the
influence
of
the
mysteries
upon
christianity
remarks

this
is
perfectly
true
but
it
was
not
only
the
influence
of
milieu
not
only
the
fact
that
the
faiths
were
as
cumont
points
out
more
advanced
richer
in
ideas
and
sentiments
more
pregnant
more
poignant
than
the
more
strictly
faiths
but
they
possessed
in
common
with
christianity
certain
distinctive
features
lacking
in
these
latter
if
we
were
asked
to
define
the
special
characteristic
of
the
central
christian
rite
should
we
not
state
it
as
being
a
sacred
meal
of
communion
in
which
the
worshipper
not
merely
symbolically
but
actually
partakes
of
and
becomes
one
with
his
god
receiving
thereby
the
assurance
of
eternal
life
the
body
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
preserve
thy
body
and
soul
unto
everlasting
life
but
it
is
precisely
this
conception
which
is
lacking
in
the
greek
mysteries
and
that
inevitably
as
rohde
points
out
the
eleusinian
mysteries
in
common
with
all
greek
religion
differentiated
clearly
between
gods
and
men
eins

the
attainment
of
union
with
the
god
by
way
of
ecstasy
as
in
other
mystery
cults
is
foreign
to
the
eleusinian
idea
as
cumont
puts
it
the
deities
rejoice
in
the
perpetual
calm
and

of

the

in
other
words
greek
religion
lacks
the
sacramental
idea
note
weston
used
greek
alphabetic
characters
above
thus
even
if
we
set
aside
the
absence
of
a
parallel
between
the
ritual
of
the
greek
mysteries
and
the
of
the
grail
stories
eleusis
would
be
unable
to
offer
us
those
essential
elements
which
would
have
rendered
possible
a
translation
of
the
incidents
of
those
stories
into
terms
of
high
christian
symbolism
yet
we
can
not
refrain
from
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
in
the
legend
that
not
merely
rendered
possible
but
actually
invited
such
a
translation
if
we
thus
dismiss
as
fruitless
for
our
investigation
the
most
famous
representative
of
the
hellenic
mysteries
proper
how
does
the
question
stand
with
regard
to
those
faiths
to
which
cumont
is
referring
the
hellenized
cults
of
asia
minor
here
the
evidence
not
merely
of
the
existence
of
mysteries
but
of
their
widespread
popularity
and
permeating
influence
is
overwhelming
the
difficulty
is
not
so
much
to
prove
our
case
as
to
select
and
the
evidence
germane
to
our
enquiry
regarding
the
question
as
a
whole
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
as
anrich
remarks
the
extent
of
the
literature
devoted
to
the
mysteries
stands
in
no
relation
whatever
gar

to
the
importance
in
reality
attached
to
them
later
in
the

a
just
remark
which
it
would
be
well
if
certain
critics
who
make
a
virtue
of
refusing
to
accept
as
evidence
anything
short
of
a
direct
and
positive
literary
statement
would
bear
in
mind
there
are
certain
lines
of
research
in
which
as
bishop
butler
long
since
emphasized
probability
must
be
our
guide
fortunately
however
so
far
as
our
present
research
is
concerned
we
have
more
than
probability
to
rely
upon
not
only
did
these
nature
cults
with
which
we
are
dealing
express
themselves
in
mystery
terms
but
as
regards
these
special
mysteries
we
possess
clear
and
definite
information
and
we
know
moreover
that
in
the
western
world
they
were
of
all
the
mystery
faiths
the
most
widely
spread
and
the
most
influential
as
sir
frazer
has
before
now
pointed
out
there
are
parallel
and
forms
of
this
cult
the
name
of
the
god
and
certain
details
of
the
ritual
may
differ
in
different
countries
but
whether
he
hails
from
babylon
phrygia
or
phoenicia
whether
he
be
called
tammuz
attis
or
adonis
the
main
lines
of
the
story
are
fixed
and
invariable
always
he
is
young
and
beautiful
always
the
beloved
of
a
great
goddess
always
he
is
the
victim
of
a
tragic
and
untimely
death
a
death
which
entails
bitter
loss
and
misfortune
upon
a
mourning
world
and
which
for
the
salvation
of
that
world
is
followed
by
a
resurrection
death
and
resurrection
mourning
and
rejoicing
present
themselves
in
sharp
antithesis
in
each
and
all
of
the
forms
we
know
the
god
best
as
adonis
for
it
was
under
that
name
that
though
not
originally
greek
he
became
known
to
the
greek
world
was
adopted
by
them
with
ardour
carried
by
them
to
alexandria
where
his
feast
assumed
the
character
of
a
state
solemnity
under
that
name
his
story
has
been
enshrined
in
art
and
as
adonis
he
is
loved
and
lamented
to
this
day
the
adonis
ritual
may
be
held
to
be
the
classic
form
of
the
cult
but
in
rome
the
centre
of
western
civilization
it
was
otherwise
there
it
was
the
phrygian
god
who
was
in
possession
the
dominating
position
held
by
the
cult
of
attis
and
the
magna
mater
and
the
profound
influence
exercised
by
that
cult
over
better
known
but
subsequently
introduced
forms
of
worship
have
not
so
far
been
sufficiently
realized
the
first
of
the
oriental
cults
to
gain
a
footing
in
the
imperial
city
the
worship
of
the
magna
mater
of
pessinonte
was
for
a
time
rigidly
confined
within
the
limits
of
her
sanctuary
the
orgiastic
ritual
of
the
priests
of
kybele
made
at
first
little
appeal
to
the
more
disciplined
temperament
of
the
roman
population
by
degrees
however
it
won
its
way
and
by
the
reign
of
claudius
had
become
so
popular
that
the
emperor
instituted
public
feasts
in
honour
of
kybele
and
attis
feasts
which
were
celebrated
at
the
spring
solstice
march
as
the
public
feast
increased
in
popularity
so
did
the
mystery
feast
of
which
the
initiated
alone
were
privileged
to
partake
acquire
a
symbolic

the

in

study
goes
so
far
as
to
refer
to
bishop
aberkios
to
whose
enigmatic
epitaph
our
attention
was
directed
in
the
last
chapter
as
der
another
element
aided
in
the
diffusion
of
the
ritual
of
all
the
oriental
cults
which
journeyed
westward
under
the
aegis
of
rome
none
was
so
deeply
rooted
or
so
widely
spread
as
the
originally
persian
cult
of
mithra
the
popular
religion
of
the
roman
legionary
but
between
the
cults
of
mithra
and
of
attis
there
was
a
close
and
intimate
alliance
in
parts
of
asia
minor
the
persian
god
had
early
taken
over
features
of
the
phrygian
deity

the
union
between
mithra
and
the
goddess
anâhita
was
held
to
be
the
equivalent
of
that
subsisting
between
the
two
great
phrygian
deities
the
most
ancient
mithreum
known
that
at
ostia
was
attached
to
the
metroon
the
temple
of

at

the
ruins
of
the
two
temples
are
but
a
few
steps
apart

de
a
proof
of
the
close
union
of
the
two
cults
is
afforded
by
the
mystic
rite
of
the
taurobolium
which
was
practised
by
both
and
which
in
the
west
at
least
seems
to
have
passed
from
the
temples
of
the
mithra
to
those
of
the
magna
mater
at
the
same
time
cumont
remarks
that
the
actual
rite
seems
to
have
been
practised
in
asia
from
a
great
antiquity
before
mithraism
had
attributed
to
it
a
spiritual
significance
it
is
thus
possible
that
the
rite
had
earlier
formed
a
part
of
the
attis
initiation
and
had
been
temporarily
disused
we
shall
see
that
the
union
of
the
cults
becomes
of
distinct
importance
when
we
examine
a
the
spiritual
significance
of
these
rituals
and
their
elements
of
affinity
with
christianity
b
their
possible
diffusion
in
the
british
isles
but
now
what
do
we
know
of
the
actual
details
of
the
attis
mysteries
the
first
and
most
important
point
was
a
mystic
meal
at
which
the
food
partaken
of
was
served
in
the
sacred
vessels
the
tympanum
and
the
cymbals
the
formula
of
an
attis
initiate
was
i
have
eaten
from
the
tympanum
i
have
drunk
from
the
cymbals
as
i
have
remarked
above
the
food
thus
partaken
of
was
a
food
of
life
die

speise
des

dieterich
in
his
interesting
study
entitled
eine
mithrasliturgie
refers
to
this
meal
as
the
centre
of
the
whole
religious
action
further
in
some
mysterious
manner
the
fate
of
the
initiate
was
connected
with
and
dependent
upon
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
god
the
christian
writer
firmicius
maternus
at
one
time
himself
an
initiate
has
left
an
account
of
the
ceremony
without
however
specifying
whether
the
deity

the
above
has
an
english
translation
of
weston
greek
hepding
holds
that
in
some
cases
there
was
an
actual
burial
and
awakening
with
the
god
to
a
new
life
in
any
case
it
is
clear
that
the
successful
issue
of
the
test
of
initiation
was
dependent
upon
the
resurrection
and
revival
of
the
god
now
is
it
not
clear
that
we
have
here
a
close
parallel
with
the
grail
romances
in
each
case
we
have
a
common
and
mystic
meal
in
which
the
food
partaken
of
stands
in
close
connection
with
the
holy
vessels
in
the
attis
feast
the
initiates
actually
ate
and
drank
from
these
vessels
in
the
romances
the
grail
community
never
actually
eat
from
the
grail
itself
but
the
food
is
in
some
mysterious
and
unexplained
manner
supplied
by
it
in
both
cases
it
is
a
a
food
of
life
this
point
is
especially
insisted
upon
in
the
parzival
where
the
grail
community
never
become
any
older
than
they
were
on
the
day
they
first
beheld
the
talisman
in
the
attis
initiation
the
proof
that
the
candidate
has
successfully
passed
the
test
is
afforded
by
the
revival
of
the
god
in
the
grail
romances
the
proof
lies
in
the
healing
of
the
fisher
king
thus
while
deferring
for
a
moment
any
insistence
on
the
obvious
points
of
parallelism
with
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
and
the
possibilities
of
spiritual
teaching
inherent
in
the
ceremonies
necessary
links
in
our
chain
of
argument
we
are
i
think
entitled
to
hold
that
even
when
we
pass
beyond
the
outward
of
the
story
the
march
of
incident
the
character
of
the
king
his
title
his
disability
and
relation
to
his

to
the
inner
and
deeper
significance
of
the
tale
the
nature
cults
still
remain

it
is
their
inner
their
esoteric

which
will

what
appears
at

sight
the
wholly
irreconcilable
elements
of
and
high
spiritual
mystery
chapter
xi
the
secret
of
the
grail
the
naassene
document
we
have
now
seen
that
the
ritual
which
as
we
have
postulated
lies
in
a
fragmentary
and
distorted
condition
at
the
root
of
our
existing
grail
romances
possessed
elements
capable
of
assimilation
with
a
religious
system
which
the
great
bulk
of
its
modern
adherents
would
unhesitatingly
declare
to
be
its
very
antithesis
that
christianity
might
have
borrowed
from
previously
existing
cults
certain
outward
signs
and
symbols
might
have
accommodated
itself
to
already
existing
fasts
and
feasts
may
be
perforce
has
had
to
be
more
or
less
grudgingly
admitted
that
such
a
rapprochement
should
have
gone
further
that
it
should
even
have
been
inherent
in
the
very
nature
of
the
faith
that
to
some
of
the
deepest
thinkers
of
old
christianity
should
have
been
held
for
no
new
thing
but
a
fulfilment
of
the
promise
enshrined
in
the
mysteries
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
will
to
many
be
a
strange
and
startling
thought
yet
so
it
was
and
i
firmly
believe
that
it
is
only
in
the
recognition
of
this
claim
of
essential
kinship
between
christianity
and
the
pagan
mysteries
that
we
shall
find
the
key
to
the
secret
of
the
grail
and
here
at
the
outset
i
would
ask
those
readers
who
are
inclined
to
turn
with
feelings
of
contemptuous
impatience
from
what
they
deem
an
unprofitable
discussion
of
idle
speculations
which
have
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
a
problem
they
hold
to
be
one
of
purely
literary
interest
to
be
solved
by
literary
comparison
and
criticism
and
by
no
other
method
to
withhold
their
verdict
till
they
have
carefully
examined
the
evidence
i
am
about
to
bring
forward
evidence
which
has
never
so
far
been
examined
in
this
connection
but
which
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
provides
us
with
clear
and
unmistakable
proof
of
the
actual
existence
of
a
ritual
in
all
points
analogous
to
that
indicated
by
the
grail
romances
in
the
previous
chapter
we
have
seen
that
there
is
evidence
and
abundant
evidence
not
merely
of
the
existence
of
mysteries
connected
with
the
worship
of
but
of
the
high
importance
assigned
to
such
mysteries
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
christianity
they
were
undoubtedly
the
most
popular
and
the
most
influential
of
the
foreign
cults
adopted
by
imperial
rome
in
support
of
this
statement
i
quoted
certain
passages
from
cumont
religions
orientales
in
which
he
touches
on
the
subject
here
are
two
other
quotations
which
may
well
serve
as
introduction
to
the
evidence
we
are
about
to
examine
researches
on
the
doctrines
and
practices
common
to
christianity
and
the
oriental
mysteries
almost
invariably
go
back
beyond
the
limits
of
the
roman
empire
to
the
hellenized
east
it
is
there
we
must
seek
the
key
of
enigmas
still
unsolved
the
essential
fact
to
remember
is
that
the
eastern
religions
had
diffused
first
anterior
to
then
parallel
with
christianity
doctrines
which
acquired
with
this
latter
a
universal
authority
in
the
decline
of
the
ancient
world
the
preaching
of
asiatic
priests
prepared
in
their
own
despite
the
triumph
of
the
church
but
the
triumph
of
the
new
faith
once
assured
the
organizing
dominating
influence
of
imperial
rome
speedily
came
into
play
christianity
originally
an
eastern
became
a
western
religion
the
elements
were
frowned
upon
kinship
with
faiths
ignored
or
denied
where
the
resemblances
between
the
cults
proved
too
striking
for
either
of
these
methods
such
resemblances
were
boldly
attributed
to
the
invention
of
the
father
of
lies
himself
a
cunning
snare
whereby
to
deceive
unwary
souls
christianity
was
carefully
trimmed
shaped
and
forced
into
an
orthodox
mould
and
anything
that
refused
to
adapt
itself
to
this
drastic
process
became
by
that
very
refusal
anathema
to
the
righteous
small
wonder
that
under
such
conditions
the
early
ages
of
the
church
were
marked
by
a
fruitful
crop
of
heresies
and
became
an
intellectual
pastime
in
high
favour
among
the
strictly
orthodox
among
the
writers
of
this
period
whose
works
have
been
preserved
hippolytus
bishop
of
portus
in
the
early
years
of
the
third
century
was
one
of
the
most
industrious
he
compiled
a
voluminous
treatise
entitled
philosophumena
or
the
refutation
of
all
heresies
of
which
only
one
and
that
of
the
fourteenth
century
has
descended
to
us
the
work
was
already
partially
known
by
quotations
the
first
book
had
been
attributed
to
origen
and
published
in
the
editio
princeps
of
his
works
the
text
originally
consisted
of
ten
books
but
of
these
the
first
three
and
part
of
the
fourth
are
missing
from
the
ms
the
origen
text
supplies
part
of
the
lacuna
but
two
entire
books
and
part
of
a
third
are
missing
now
these
special
books
we
learn
from
the
introduction
dealt
with
the
doctrines
and
mysteries
of
the
egyptians
and
chaldaeans
whose
most
sacred
secrets
hippolytus
boasts
that
he
has
divulged
curiously
enough
not
only
are
these
books
lacking
but
in
the
epitome
at
the
beginning
of
book
the
summary
of
their
contents
is
also
missing
a
significant
detail
which
as
has
been
suggested
by
critics
looks
like
a
deliberate
attempt
on
the
part
of
some
copyist
to
suppress
the
information
contained
in
the
books
in
question
incidentally
this
would
seem
to
suggest
that
the
worthy
bishop
was
not
making
an
empty
boast
when
he
claimed
to
be
a
revealer
of
secrets
but
what
is
of
special
interest
to
us
is
the
treatment
meted
out
to
the
christian
mystics
whom
hippolytus
stigmatizes
as
heretics
and
whose
teaching
he
deliberately
asserts
to
be
simply
that
of
the
pagan
mysteries
he
had
come
into
possession
of
a
secret
document
belonging
to
one
of
these
sects
whom
he
calls
the
naassenes
this
document
he
gives
in
full
and
it
certainly
throws
a
most
extraordinary
light
upon
the
relation
which
this
early
christian
sect
held
to
exist
between
the
new
and
the
old
faith
mr
mead
in
his
translation
of
the
hermetic
writings
entitled
hermes
has
given
a
careful
translation
and
detailed
analysis
of
this
most
important
text
and
it
is
from
his
work
that
i
shall
quote
so
far
as
the
structure
of
the
document
is
concerned
mr
mead
distinguishes
three
stages
a
an
original
pagan
source
possibly
dating
from
the
last
half
of
the
first
century
but
containing
material
of
earlier
date
b
the
working
over
of
this
source
by
a
jewish
mystic
whom
the
critic
holds
to
have
been
a
contemporary
of
philo
c
a
subsequent
working
over
with
additions
by
a
christian
gnostic
naassene
in
the
middle
of
the
second
century
finally
the
text
was
edited
by
hippolytus
in
the
refutation
about
thus
the
ground
covered
is
roughly
from
to
in
the
translation
given
by
mr
mead
these
successive
layers
are
distinguished
by
initial
letters
and
difference
of
type
but
these
distinctions
are
not
of
importance
for
us
what
we
desire
to
know
is
what
was
really
held
and
taught
by
these
mystics
of
the
early
church
mr
mead
in
his
introductory
remarks
summarizes
the
evidence
as
follows
the
claim
of
these
gnostics
was
practically
that
christianity
or
rather
the
good
news
of
the
christ
was
precisely
the
consummation
of
the
inner
doctrine
of
the
of
all
the
nations
the
end
of
them
all
was
the
revelation
of
the
mystery
of
man
in
other
words
the
teaching
of
these
naassenes
was
practically
a
synthesis
of
all
the
and
although
hippolytus
regards
them
as
nothing
more
than
devotees
of
the
cult
of
the
magna
mater
we
shall
see
that
while
their
doctrine
and
teaching
were
undoubtedly
based
mainly
upon
the
doctrine
and
practices
of
the
phrygian
mysteries
they
practically
identified
the
deity
therein
worshipped
attis
with
the
presiding
deity
of
all
the
other
mysteries
mr
mead
draws
attention
to
the
fact
that
hippolytus
places
these
naassenes
in
the
of
his
refutation
they
are
the
first
group
of
heretics
with
whom
he
deals
and
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
he
considered
them
if
not
the
most
important
at
least
the
oldest
of
such
sectaries
with
these
prefatory
remarks
it
will
be
well
to
let
the
document
speak
for
itself
it
is
of
considerable
length
and
as
we
have
seen
of
intricate
construction
i
shall
therefore
quote
only
those
sections
which
bear
directly
upon
the
subject
of
our
investigation
any
reader
desirous
of
fuller
information
can
refer
to
mr
mead
work
or
to
the
original
text
published
by
reitzenstein
at
the
outset
it
will
be
well
to
understand
that
the
central
doctrine
of
all
these
mysteries
is
what
reitzenstein
sums
up
as
the
doctrine
of
the
man
the
heavenly
man
the
son
of
god
who
descends
and
becomes
a
slave
of
the
fate
sphere
the
man
who
though
originally
endowed
with
all
power
descends
into
weakness
and
bondage
and
has
to
win
his
own
freedom
and
regain
his
original
state
this
doctrine
is
not
egyptian
but
seems
to
have
been
in
its
origin
part
and
parcel
of
the
chaldean
and
was
widely
spread
in
hellenistic
circles
thus
in
the
introductory
remarks
prefixed
by
hippolytus
to
the
document
he
is
quoting
he
asserts
that
the
naassenes
honour
as
the
logos
of
all
universals
man
and
son
of
man
and
they
divide
him
into
three
for
they
say
he
has
a
mental
psychic
and
choďc
aspect
and
they
think
that
the
gnosis
of
this
man
is
the
beginning
of
the
possibility
of
knowing
god
saying
beginning
of
perfection
is
the
gnosis
of
man
but
the
gnosis
of
god
is
perfected
perfection
all
these
mental
psychic
and
earthy
descended
together
into
one
man
jesus
the
son
of
mary
thus
the
myth
of
man
the
mystery
of
generation
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
document
in
question
and
this
myth
is
set
forth
with
reference
to
all
the
mysteries
beginning
with
the
assyrian
paragraph
runs
now
the
assyrians
call
this
mystery
adonis
and
whenever
it
is
called
adonis
it
is
aphrodite
who
is
in
love
with
and
desires
soul
and
aphrodite
is
genesis
according
to
them
but
in
the
next
section
the
writer
jumps
from
the
assyrian
to
the
phrygian
mysteries
saying
but
if
the
mother
of
the
gods
emasculates
attis
she
too
regarding
him
as
the
object
of
her
love
it
is
the
blessed
nature
above
of
the
and
aeonian
spaces
which
calls
back
the
masculine
power
of
soul
to
herself
in
a
note
to
this
mr
mead
quotes
from
the
life
of
isidorus
i
fell
asleep
and
in
a
vision
attis
seemed
to
appear
to
me
and
on
behalf
of
the
mother
of
gods
to
initiate
me
into
the
feast
called
hilario
a
mystery
which
discloses
the
way
of
our
salvation
from
hades
throughout
the
document
reference
is
continually
made
to
the
phrygians
and
their
doctrine
of
man
the
eleusinian
mysteries
are
then
treated
of
as
subsequent
to
the
phrygian
after
the
phrygians
the
athenians
but
the
teaching
is
represented
as
being
essentially
identical
we
have
then
a
passage
of
great
interest
for
our
investigation
in
which
the
mysteries
are
sharply
divided
into
two
classes
and
their
separate
content
clearly
defined
there
are
the
little
mysteries
those
of
the
fleshly
generation
and
after
men
have
been
initiated
into
them
they
should
cease
for
a
while
and
become
initiated
in
the
great
heavenly
mysteries
for
this
is
the
gate
of
heaven
and
this
is
the
house
of
god
where
the
good
god
dwells
alone
into
which
house
no
impure
man
shall
come
hippolytus
remarks
that
these
naassenes
say
that
the
performers
in
theatres
they
too
neither
say
nor
do
anything
without
design
for
example
when
the
people
assemble
in
the
theatre
and
a
man
comes
on
the
stage
clad
in
a
robe
different
from
all
others
with
lute
in
hand
on
which
he
plays
and
thus
chants

great

comments
for
these
and

reasons
these
naassenes
frequent
what
are
called
the
mysteries
of
the
great
mother
believing
that
they
obtain
the
clearest
view
of
the
universal
mystery
from
the
things
done
in
them
and
after
all
this
evidence
of
elaborate
syncretism
this
practical
identification
of
all
the
with
the
vegetation
deity
we
are
confronted
in
the
concluding
paragraph
after
stating
that
the
true
gate
is
jesus
the
blessed
with
this
astounding
claim
from
the
pen
of
the
latest
redactor
and
of
all
men
we
alone
are
christians
accomplishing
the
mystery
at
the
third
gate
now
what
conclusions
are
to
be
drawn
from
this
document
which
in
its
entirety
mr
mead
regards
as
the
most
important
source
we
have
for
the
higher
side
regeneration
of
the
hellenistic
mysteries
first
of
all
does
it
not
provide
a
complete
and
overwhelming
justification
of
those
scholars
who
have
insisted
upon
the
importance
of
these
vegetation
cults
a
justification
of
which
from
the
very
nature
of
their
studies
they
could
not
have
been
aware
sir
james
frazer
and
those
who
followed
him
have
dealt
with
the
public
side
of
the
cult
with
its
importance
as
a
recognized
vehicle
for
obtaining
material
advantages
it
was
the
social
rather
than
the
individual
aspect
which
appealed
to
them
now
we
find
that
in
the
immediate
and
era
these
cults
were
considered
not
only
most
potent
factors
for
assuring
the
material
prosperity
of
land
and
folk
but
were
also
held
to
be
the
most
appropriate
vehicle
for
imparting
the
highest
religious
teaching
the
vegetation
deities
and
more
especially
the
phrygian
god
were
the
chosen
guides
to
the
knowledge
of
and
union
with
the
supreme
spiritual
source
of
life
of
which
they
were
the
communicating
medium
we
must
remember
that
though
the
document
before
us
is
in
its
actual
form
the
expression
of
faith
of
a
discredited
sect
the
essential
groundwork
upon
which
it
is
elaborated
belongs
to
a
period
anterior
to
christianity
and
that
the
ode
in
honour
of
attis
quoted
above
not
only
forms
part
of
the
original
source
but
is
in
the
opinion
of
competent
critics
earlier
than
the
source
itself
i
would
also
recall
to
the
memory
of
the
reader
the
passage
previously
quoted
from
cumont
in
which
he
refers
to
the
use
made
by
the
philosophers
of
the
attis
legend
as
the
mould
into
which
they
poured
their
special
theories
of
the
universe
and
of
generation
can
the
importance
of
a
cult
capable
of
such
developments
be
easily
exaggerated
secondly
and
of
more
immediate
importance
for
our
investigation
is
it
not
evident
that
we
have
here
all
the
elements
necessary
for
a
mystical
development
of
the
grail
tradition
the
exoteric
side
of
the
cult
gives
us
the
human
the
elements
the
suffering
king
the
waste
land
the
effect
upon
the
folk
the
task
that
lies
before
the
hero
the
group
of
grail
symbols
the
esoteric
side
provides
us
with
the
mystic
meal
the
food
of
life
connected
in
some
mysterious
way
with
a
vessel
which
is
the
centre
of
the
cult
the
combination
of
that
vessel
with
a
weapon
a
combination
bearing
a
significance
a
double
initiation
into
the
source
of
the
lower
and
higher
spheres
of
life
the
ultimate
proof
of
the
successful
issue
of
the
final
test
in
the
restoration
of
the
king
i
would
ask
any
critic
whether
any
of
the
numerous
theories
previously
advanced
has
shown
itself
capable
of
furnishing
so
comprehensive
a
solution
of
the
ensemble
problem
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
acceptance
of
this
theory
of
the
origin
of
the
story
in
no
way
excludes
the
possibility
of
the
introduction
of
other
elements
during
the
period
of
romantic
evolution
as
i
have
previously
insisted
not
all
of
those
who
handled
the
theme
knew
the
real
character
of
the
material
with
which
they
were
dealing
while
even
among
those
who
did
know
there
were
some
who
allowed
themselves
considerable
latitude
in
their
methods
of
composition
who
did
not
scruple
to
introduce
elements
foreign
to
the
original
stoff
but
which
would
make
an
appeal
to
the
public
of
the
day
thus
while
bleheris
who
i
believe
really
held
a
tradition
of
the
original
cult
contented
himself
with
a
practically
simple
recital
of
the
initiations
later
redactors
under
the
influence
of
the
crusades
and
the
longinus
legend
possibly
also
actuated
by
a
desire
to
substitute
a
more
edifying
explanation
than
that
originally
offered
added
a
directly
christian
interpretation
of
the
lance
as
it
is
concerning
the
lance
alone
that
gawain
asks
the
first
modification
must
have
been
at
this
point
the
bringing
into
line
of
the
twin
symbol
the
vase
would
come
later
the
fellowship
it
may
even
be
the
rivalry
between
the
two
great
benedictine
houses
of
fescamp
and
glastonbury
led
to
the
redaction
in
the
interests
of
the
latter
of
a
legend
parallel
to
that
which
was
the
genuine
possession
of
the
french
house
for
we
must
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
original
story
is
a
and
not
a
grail
legend
a
phial
containing
the
blood
of
our
lord
was
said
to
have
been
buried
in
the
tomb
of
joseph
surely
a
curious
fate
for
so
precious
a
relic
and
the
abbey
never
laid
claim
to
the
possession
of
the
vessel
of
the
last
supper
had
it
done
so
it
would
certainly
have
become
a
noted
centre
of
pilgrimage
as
dr
brugger
acutely
remarks
such
relics
are
besucht
not
gesucht
but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
kindred
abbey
of
fescamp
had
developed
its
genuine
legend
into
a
grail
romance
and
there
is
critical
evidence
to
lead
us
to
suppose
that
the
text
we
know
as
perlesvaus
was
in
its
original
form
now
it
is
to
be
feared
practically
impossible
to
reconstruct
connected
with
that
abbey
as
we
have
it
this
alone
of
all
the
grail
romances
connects
the
hero
alike
with
nicodemus
and
with
joseph
of
arimathea
the
respective
protagonists
of
the
legends
while
its
assertion
that
the
original
latin
text
was
found
in
a
holy
house
situated
in
marshes
the
burial
place
of
arthur
and
guenevere
unmistakably
points
to
glastonbury
in
any
case
when
robert
de
borron
proposed
to
himself
the
task
of
composing
a
trilogy
on
the
subject
the
joseph
legend
was
already
in
a
developed
form
and
a
fresh
element
the
combination
of
the
grail
legend
with
the
story
of
a
highly
popular
hero
known
in
this
connection
as
perceval
though
he
has
had
many
names
was
established
borron
was
certainly
aware
of
the
real
character
of
his
material
he
knew
the
grail
cult
as
christianized
mystery
and
while
following
the
romance
development
handled
the
theme
on
distinctively
religious
lines
preserving
the
mystery
element
in
its
development
and
equating
the
vessel
of
the
mystic
feast
with
the
christian
eucharist
from
what
we
now
know
of
the
material
it
seems
certain
that
the
equation
was
already
established
and
that
borron
was
simply
stating
in
terms
of
romance
what
was
already
known
to
him
in
terms
of
mystery
in
face
of
the
evidence
above
set
forth
there
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
that
the
mystic
feast
of
the
nature
cults
really
had
and
that
at
a
very
early
date
been
brought
into
touch
with
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
but
to
chrétien
de
troyes
the
story
was
romance
pure
and
simple
there
was
still
a
certain
element
of
awe
connected
with
grail
and
grail
feast
but
of
the
real
meaning
and
origin
of
the
incidents
he
had
i
am
convinced
no
idea
whatever
probably
many
modifications
were
already
in
his
source
but
the
result
so
far
as
his
poem
is
concerned
is
that
he
duplicated
the
character
of
the
fisher
king
he
separated
both
father
and
son
from
the
wasted
land
transferring
the
responsibility
for
the
woes
of
land
and
folk
to
the
quester
who
although
his
failure
might
be
responsible
for
their
continuance
never
had
anything
to
do
with
their
origin
he
bestowed
the
wound
of
the
grail
king
deeply
significant
in
its
original
conception
and
connection
upon
perceval
father
a
shadowy
character
entirely
apart
from
the
grail
tradition
there
is
no
trace
of
the
initiation
elements
in
his
poem
no
perilous
chapel
no
welding
of
the
sword
we
have
here
passed
completely
and
entirely
into
the
land
of
romance
the
doors
of
the
temple
are
closed
behind
us
it
is
the
story
of
perceval
li
gallois
not
the
ritual
of
the
grail
which
fills
the
stage
and
with
the
story
of
perceval
there
comes
upon
the
scene
a
crowd
of
themes
absolutely
foreign
to
the
grail
itself
thus
we
have
not
only
the
central
theme
of
the
lad
reared
in
woodland
solitude
making
his
entrance
into
a
world
of
whose
ordinary
relations
he
is
absolutely
and
ludicrously
ignorant
and
the
traditional
illustrations
of
the
results
of
that
ignorance
such
as
the
story
of
the
lady
of
the
tent
and
the
stolen
ring
but
we
have
also
the
sinister
figure
of
the
red
knight
with
his
witch
mother
the
three
drops
of
blood
upon
the
snow
and
the
ensuing
love
trance
pure
themes
mingled
with
the
more
chivalric
elements
of
the
rescue
of
a
distressed
maiden
and
the
vanquishing
in
single
combat
of
doughty
antagonists
giant
or
saracen
one
and
all
of
them
elements
offering
widespread
popular
parallels
and
inviting
the
unwary
critic
into
paths
which
lead
him
far
astray
from
the
goal
of
his
quest
the
grail
castle
i
dispute
in
no
way
the
possible
presence
of
celtic
elements
in
this
complex
the
lance
may
well
have
borrowed
at
one
time
features
from
early
irish
tradition
at
another
details
obviously
closely
related
to
the
longinus
legend
it
is
even
possible
that
as
burdach
insists
features
of
the
byzantine
liturgy
may
have
coloured
the
representation
of
the
grail
procession
although
for
my
own
part
i
consider
such
a
theory
highly
improbable
in
view
of
the
facts
that
a
chrétien
poem
otherwise
shows
no
traces
of
oriental
influence
b
the
in
the
eastern
rite
is
simply
a
small
knife
c
the
presence
of
the
lights
is
accounted
for
by
the
author
of
sone
de
nansai
on
the
ground
of
a
nativity
legend
the
authenticity
of
which
was
pointed
out
by
the
late
gaston
paris
d
it
is
only
in
the
later
prose
form
that
we
find
any
suggestion
of
a
grail
chapel
whereas
were
the
source
of
the
story
really
to
be
found
in
the
mass
such
a
feature
would
certainly
have
had
its
place
in
the
earliest
versions
but
in
each
and
all
these
cases
the
solution
proposed
has
no
relation
to
other
features
of
the
story
it
is
consequently
of
value
in
and
per
se
only
and
can
not
be
regarded
as
valid
evidence
for
the
source
of
the
legend
as
a
whole
in
the
process
of
transmutation
from
ritual
to
romance
the
kernel
the
grail
legend
proper
may
be
said
to
have
formed
for
itself
a
shell
composed
of
accretions
of
widely
differing
provenance
it
is
the
legitimate
task
of
criticism
to
analyse
such
accretions
and
to
resolve
them
into
their
original
elements
but
they
are
accretions
and
should
be
treated
as
such
not
confounded
with
the
original
and
essential
material
after
upwards
of
thirty
years
spent
in
careful
study
of
the
grail
legend
and
romances
i
am
firmly
and
entirely
convinced
that
the
root
origin
of
the
whole
bewildering
complex
is
to
be
found
in
the
vegetation
ritual
treated
from
the
esoteric
point
of
view
as
a
and
in
that
alone
christian
legend
and
traditional
have
undoubtedly
contributed
to
the
perfected
romantic
corpus
but
they
are
in
truth
subsidiary
and
secondary
features
a
criticism
that
would
treat
them
as
original
and
primary
can
but
defeat
its
own
object
magnified
out
of
proportion
they
become
upon
the
path
instead
of
towards
the
goal
chapter
xii
mithra
and
attis
the
fact
that
there
was
at
a
very
early
date
among
a
certain
sect
of
christian
gnostics
a
body
of
doctrine
based
upon
the
essential
harmony
existing
between
the
old
faith
and
the
new
which
claimed
by
means
of
a
initiation
to
impact
to
the
inner
circle
of
its
adherents
the
secret
of
life
physical
and
spiritual
being
in
face
of
the
evidence
given
in
the
previous
chapter
placed
beyond
any
possible
doubt
we
must
now
ask
is
there
any
evidence
that
such
teaching
survived
for
any
length
of
time
or
could
have
penetrated
to
the
british
isles
where
in
view
of
the
priority
of
the
form
the
grail
legend
as
we
know
it
seems
to
have
originated
i
think
there
is
at
least
presumptive
evidence
of
such
preservation
and
transmission
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
close
connection
existing
between
the
attis
cult
and
the
worship
of
the
popular
persian
deity
mithra
and
have
given
quotations
from
cumont
illustrating
this
connection
it
will
be
worth
while
to
study
the
question
somewhat
more
closely
and
discover
if
possible
the
reason
for
this
intimate
alliance
on
the
face
of
it
there
seems
to
be
absolutely
no
reason
for
the
connection
of
these
cults
the
two
deities
in
no
way
resemble
each
other
the
stories
connected
with
them
have
no
possible
analogy
the
root
conception
is
widely
divergent
with
the
character
of
the
deity
we
know
as
adonis
or
attis
we
are
now
thoroughly
familiar
in
the
first
instance
it
seems
to
be
the
human
element
in
the
myth
which
is
most
insisted
upon
he
is
a
mortal
youth
beloved
by
a
great
goddess
only
after
his
tragic
death
does
he
appear
to
assume
divine
attributes
and
alike
in
death
and
resurrection
become
the
accepted
personification
of
natural
energies

such
a
criticism
applies
of
course
equally
to
attis
mithra
on
the
other
hand
occupies
an
entirely
different
position
cumont
in
his
mystčres

thus
describes
him
he
is

with
the
vegetation
goods

this
summary
may
aptly
be
compared
with
the
lament
for
tammuz
quoted
in
chapter
but
the
worship
of
mithra
in
the
form
in
which
it
spread
throughout
the
roman
empire
mithra
as
the
god
of
the
imperial
armies
the
deity
beloved
of
the
roman
legionary
was
in
no
sense
of
this
concrete
and
material
type
this
is
how
cumont
sums
up
the
main
features
mithra
is
the
mediator
who
stands
between
le
dieu
inaccessible
et
inconnaissable
qui
rčgne
dans
les
sphčres
éthérées
et
le

the

finally
mithraism
taught
the
resurrection
of
the
body
mithra
will
descend
upon
earth
and
will
revive
all
men
all
will
issue
from
their
graves
resume
their
former
appearance
and
recognize
each
other
all
will
be
united
in
one
great
assembly
and
the
good
will
be
separated
from
the
evil
then
in
one
supreme
sacrifice
mithra
will
immolate
the
divine
bull
and
mixing
its
fat
with
the
consecrated
wine
will
offer
to
the
righteous
the
cup
of
eternal
life
the
final
parallel
with
the
messianic
feast
described
in
chapter
is
too
striking
to
be
overlooked
the
celestial
nature
of
the
deity
is
also
well
brought
out
in
the
curious
text
edited
by
dieterich
from
the
great
magic
papyrus
of
the
bibliothčque
nationale
and
referred
to
in
a
previous
chapter
this
text
purports
to
be
a
formula
of
initiation
and
we
find
the
aspirant
ascending
through
the
seven
heavenly
spheres
to
be
finally
met
by
mithra
who
brings
him
to
the
presence
of
god
so
in
the
mithraic
temples
we
find
seven
ladders
the
ascent
of
which
by
the
initiate
typified
his
passage
to
the
seventh
and
supreme
heaven
bousset
points
out
that
the
original
idea
was
that
of
three
heavens
above
which
was
paradise
the
conception
of
seven
heavens
ruled
by
the
seven
planets
which
we
find
in
mithraism
is
due
to
the
influence
of
babylonian
sidereal
cults
there
is
thus
a
marked
difference
between
the
two
initiations
the
attis
initiate
dies
is
possibly
buried
and
revives
with
his
god
the
mithra
initiate
rises
direct
to
the
celestial
sphere
where
he
is
met
and
welcomed
by
his
god
there
is
here
no
evidence
of
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
deity
what
then
is
the
point
of
contact
between
the
cults
that
brought
them
into
such
close
and
intimate
relationship
i
think
it
must
be
sought
in
the
higher
teaching
which
under
widely
differing
external
mediums
included
elements
common
to
both
in
both
cults
the
final
aim
was
the
attainment
of
spiritual
and
eternal
life
moreover
both
possessed
essential
features
which
admitted
if
they
did
not
encourage
an
assimilation
with
christianity
both
of
them
if
forced
to
yield
ground
to
their
powerful
rival
could
with
a
fair
show
of
reason
claim
that
they
had
been
not
vanquished
but
fulfilled
that
their
teaching
had
in
christianity
attained
its
normal
term
the
extracts
given
above
will
show
the
striking
analogy
between
the
higher
doctrine
of
mithraism
and
the
fundamental
teaching
of
its
great
rival
a
resemblance
that
was
fully
admitted
and
which
became
the
subject
of
heated
polemic
greek
philosophers
did
not
hesitate
to
establish
a
parallel
entirely
favourable
to
mithraism
while
christian
apologists
insisted
that
such
resemblances
were
the
work
of
the
devil
a
line
of
argument
which
as
we
have
seen
above
they
had
already
adopted
with
regard
to
the
older
mysteries
it
is
a
matter
of
historical
fact
that
at
one
moment
the
religious
fate
of
the
west
hung
in
the
balance
and
it
was
an
open
question
whether
mithraism
or
christianity
would
be
the
dominant
creed
on
the
other
hand
we
have
also
seen
that
certainly
one
early
christian
sect
the
naassenes
while
equally
regarding
the
logos
as
the
centre
of
their
belief
held
the
equivalent
deity
to
be
attis
and
frequented
the
phrygian
mysteries
as
the
most
direct
source
of
spiritual
enlightenment
while
the
teaching
as
to
the
death
and
resurrection
of
the
god
and
the
celebration
of
a
mystic
feast
in
which
the
worshippers
partook
of
the
food
and
drink
of
eternal
life
offered
parallels
to
christian
doctrine
and
practice
to
the
full
as
striking
as
any
to
be
found
in
the
persian
faith
i
would
therefore
submit
that
it
was
rather
through
the
medium
of
their
inner
esoteric
teaching
that
the
two
faiths
so
different
in
their
external
practice
preserved
so
close
and
intimate
a
connection
and
that
by
the
medium
of
that
same
esoteric
teaching
both
alike
came
into
contact
with
christianity
and
in
the
case
of
the
phrygian
cult
could
and
actually
did
claim
identity
with
it
baudissin
in
his
work
above
referred
to
suggests
that
the
adonis
cult
owed
its
popularity
to
its
higher
rather
than
to
its
lower
elements
to
its
suggestion
of
life
rather
than
to
the
satisfaction
of
physical
desire
to
be
found
in
it
later
evidence
seems
to
prove
that
he
judged
correctly
we
may
also
note
that
the
attis
mysteries
were
utilized
by
the
priests
of
mithra
for
the
initiation
of
women
who
were
originally
excluded
from
the
cult
of
the
persian
god
cumont
remarks
that
this
an
absolute
rule
in
the
western
communities
seems
to
have
had
exceptions
in
the
eastern
is
it
possible
that
the
passage
quoted
in
the
previous
chapter
in
which
perceval
is
informed
that
no
woman
may
speak
of
the
grail
is
due
to
contamination
with
the
mithra
worship
it
does
not
appear
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
prominent
position
assigned
to
women
in
the
grail
ritual
the
introduction
of
a
female
grail
messenger
or
the
fact
that
with
the
exception
of
merlin
in
the
borron
text
it
is
invariably
a
maiden
who
directs
the
hero
on
his
road
to
the
grail
castle
or
reproaches
him
for
his
failure
there
but
there
is
little
doubt
that
separately
or
in
conjunction
both
cults
travelled
to
the
furthest
borders
of
the
roman
empire
the
medium
of
transmission
is
very
fully
discussed
by
cumont
in
both
of
the
works
referred
to
the
channel
appears
to
have
been
first
commercial
through
the
medium
of
syrian
merchants
as
ardently
religious
as
practically
the
syrians
introduced
their
native
deities
wherever
they
penetrated
founding
their
chapels
at
the
same
time
as
their
secondly
there
was
social
penetration
by
means
of
the
asiatic
slaves
who
formed
a
part
of
most
roman
households
and
the
state
employés
such
as
officers
of
customs
army
paymasters
largely
recruited
from
oriental
sources
thirdly
and
most
important
were
the
soldiers
the
foreign
legions
who
drawn
mostly
from
the
eastern
parts
of
the
empire
brought
their
native
deities
with
them
cumont
signalizes
as
the
most
active
agents
of
the
dispersion
of
the
cult
of
mithra
soldiers
slaves
and
merchants
as
far
north
as
hadrian
dyke
there
has
been
found
an
inscription
in
verse
in
honour
of
the
goddess
of
hierapolis
the
author
a
prefect
probably
cumont
remarks
the
officer
of
a
cohort
of
hamii
stationed
in
this
distant
spot
dedications
to
melkart
and
astarte
have
been
found
at
corbridge
near
newcastle
the
mithraic
remains
are
practically
confined
to
garrison
centres
london
york
chester
and
along
hadrian
dyke
from
the
highly
interesting
map
attached
to
the
study
giving
the
sites
of
ascertained
mithraic
remains
there
seems
to
have
been
such
a
centre
in
pembrokeshire
now
in
view
of
all
this
evidence
is
it
not
at
least
possible
that
the
higher
form
of
the
attis
cult
that
in
which
it
was
known
and
practised
by
early
gnostic
christians
may
have
been
known
in
great
britain
scholars
have
been
struck
by
the
curiously
unorthodox
tone
of
the
grail
romances
their
apparent
insistence
on
a
succession
quite
other
than
the
accredited
apostolic
tradition
and
yet
according
to
the
writers
directly
received
from
christ
himself
the
late
paulin
paris
believed
that
the
source
of
this
peculiar
feature
was
to
be
found
in
the
struggle
for
independence
of
the
early
british
church
but
after
all
the
differences
of
that
church
with
rome
affected
only
minor
points
of
discipline
the
date
of
easter
the
fashion
of
tonsure
of
the
clergy
nothing
which
touched
vital
doctrines
of
the
faith
certainly
the
british
church
never
claimed
the
possession
of
a
revelation
ŕ
part
but
if
the
theory
based
upon
the
evidence
of
the
naassene
document
be
accepted
such
a
presentation
can
be
well
accounted
for
according
to
hippolytus
the
doctrines
of
the
sect
were
derived
from
james
the
brother
of
our
lord
and
clement
of
alexandria
asserts
that
the
lord
imparted
the
gnosis
to
james
the
just
to
john
and
to
peter
after
his
resurrection
these
delivered
it
to
the
rest
of
the
apostles
and
they
to
the
seventy
thus
the
theory
proposed
in
these
pages
will
account
not
only
for
the
undeniable
parallels
existing
between
the
vegetation
cults
and
the
grail
romances
but
also
for
the
heterodox
colouring
of
the
latter
two
elements
which
at
first
sight
would
appear
to
be
wholly
unconnected
and
quite
incapable
of
relation
to
a
common
source
nor
in
view
of
the
persistent
vitality
and
survival
even
to
our
own
day
of
the
exoteric
practices
can
there
be
anything
improbable
in
the
hypothesis
of
a
late
survival
of
the
esoteric
side
of
the
ritual
cumont
points
out
that
the
worship
of
mithra
was
practised
in
the
fifth
century
in
certain
remote
cantons
of
the
alps
and
the
vosges
at
the
date
historically
assigned
to
king
arthur
thus
it
would
not
be
in
any
way
surprising
if
a
tradition
of
the
survival
of
these
rites
at
this
period
also
existed
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
tradition
of
such
a
survival
which
lies
at
the
root
and
explains
the
confused
imagery
of
the
text
we
know
as
the
elucidation
i
have
already
in
my
short
study
of
the
subject
set
forth
my
views
as
i
have
since
found
further
reasons
for
maintaining
the
correctness
of
the
solution
proposed
i
will
repeat
it
here
the
text
in
question
is
found
in
three
of
our
existing
grail
versions
in
the
of
mons
in
the
printed
edition
of
and
in
the
german
translation
of
it
is
now
prefixed
to
the
poem
of
chrétien
de
troyes
but
obviously
from
the
content
had
originally
nothing
to
do
with
that
version
it
opens
with
the
passage
quoted
above
in
which
master
blihis
utters
his
solemn
warning
against
revealing
the
secret
of
the
grail
it
goes
on
to
tell
how
aforetime
there
were
maidens
dwelling
in
the
hills
who
brought
forth
to
the
passing
traveller
food
and
drink
but
king
amangons
outraged
one
of
these
maidens
and
took
away
from
her
her
golden
cup
des
puceles
une
esforcha
et
la
coupe
li
toli
his
knights
when
they
saw
their
lord
act
thus
followed
his
evil
example
forced
the
fairest
of
the
maidens
and
robbed
them
of
their
cups
of
gold
as
a
result
the
springs
dried
up
the
land
became
waste
and
the
court
of
the
rich
fisher
which
had
filled
the
land
with
plenty
could
no
longer
be
found
for
years
the
land
lies
waste
till
in
the
days
of
king
arthur
his
knights
find
maidens
wandering
in
the
woods
each
with
her
attendant
knight
they
joust
and
one
vanquished
by
gawain
comes
to
court
and
tells
how
these
maidens
are
the
descendants
of
those
ravished
by
king
amangons
and
his
men
and
how
could
the
court
of
the
fisher
king
and
the
grail
once
more
be
found
the
land
would
again
become
fertile
is
we
are
told
so
entrancing
a
that
none
at
court
could
ever
weary
of
listening
to
his
words
the
natural
result
which
here
does
not
immediately
concern
us
was
that
arthur
knights
undertook
the
quest
and
gawain
achieved
it
now
at
first
sight
this
account
appears
to
be
nothing
but
a
fantastic
as
such
professor
brown
obviously
regarded
it
and
although
the
late
dr
sebastian
evans
attempted
in
all
seriousness
to
find
a
historical
basis
for
the
story
in
the
events
which
provoked
the
pronouncement
of
the
papal
interdict
upon
the
realm
of
king
john
and
the
consequent
deprivation
of
the
sacraments
i
am
not
aware
that
anyone
took
the
solution
seriously
yet
on
the
basis
of
the
theory
now
set
forth
is
it
not
possible
that
there
may
be
a
real
foundation
of
historical
fact
at
the
root
of
this
wildly
picturesque
tale
may
it
not
be
simply
a
poetical
version
of
the
disappearance
from
the
land
of
britain
of
the
open
performance
of
an
ancient
nature
ritual
a
ritual
that
lingered
on
in
the
hills
and
mountains
of
wales
as
the
mithra
worship
did
in
the
alps
and
vosges
celebrated
as
that
cult
habitually
was
in
natural
caverns
and
mountain
hollows
that
it
records
the
outrage
offered
by
some
probably
local
chieftain
to
a
priestess
of
the
cult
an
evil
example
followed
by
his
men
and
the
subsequent
cessation
of
the
public
celebration
of
the
rites
a
cessation
which
in
the
would
certainly
be
held
sufficient
to
account
for
any
subsequent
drought
that
might
affect
the
land
but
the
ritual
in
its
higher
esoteric
form
was
still
secretly
observed
and
the
tradition
alike
of
its
disappearance
as
a
public
cult
and
of
its
persistence
in
some
carefully
hidden
was
handed
on
in
the
families
of
those
who
had
been
perhaps
still
were
officiants
of
these
rites
that
among
the
handers
on
of
the
torch
would
be
the
descendants
of
the
outraged
maidens
is
most
probable
the
sense
of
mystery
of
a
real
danger
to
be
faced
of
an
overwhelming
spiritual
gain
to
be
won
were
of
the
essential
nature
of
the
tale
it
was
the
very
mystery
of
life
which
lay
beneath
the
picturesque
wrappings
small
wonder
that
the
quest
of
the
grail
became
the
synonym
for
the
highest
achievement
that
could
be
set
before
men
and
that
when
the
romantic
evolution
of
the
arthurian
tradition
reached
its
term
this
supreme
adventure
was
swept
within
the
magic
circle
the
knowledge
of
the
grail
was
the
utmost
man
could
achieve
knights
were
the
very
flower
of
manhood
it
was
fitting
that
to
them
the
supreme
test
be
offered
that
the
man
who
first
told
the
story
and
boldly
as
befitted
a
born
teller
of
tales
wedded
it
the
arthurian
legend
was
himself
connected
by
descent
with
the
ancient
faith
himself
actually
held
the
secret
of
the
grail
and
told
in
purposely
romantic
form
that
of
which
he
knew
i
am
firmly
convinced
nor
do
i
think
that
the
time
is
far
distant
when
the
missing
links
will
be
in
our
hand
and
we
shall
be
able
to
weld
once
more
the
golden
chain
which
connects
ancient
ritual
with
medieval
romance
chapter
xiii
the
perilous
chapel
students
of
the
grail
romances
will
remember
that
in
many
of
the
versions
the
hero
sometimes
it
is
a
heroine
meets
with
a
strange
and
terrifying
adventure
in
a
mysterious
chapel
an
adventure
which
we
are
given
to
understand
is
fraught
with
extreme
peril
to
life
the
details
vary
sometimes
there
is
a
dead
body
laid
on
the
altar
sometimes
a
black
hand
extinguishes
the
tapers
there
are
strange
and
threatening
voices
and
the
general
impression
is
that
this
is
an
adventure
in
which
supernatural
and
evil
forces
are
engaged
such
an
adventure
befalls
gawain
on
his
way
to
the
grail
castle
he
is
overtaken
by
a
terrible
storm
and
coming
to
a
chapel
standing
at
a
crossways
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
enters
for
shelter
the
altar
is
bare
with
no
cloth
or
covering
nothing
is
thereon
but
a
great
golden
candlestick
with
a
tall
taper
burning
within
it
behind
the
altar
is
a
window
and
as
gawain
looks
a
hand
black
and
hideous
comes
through
the
window
and
extinguishes
the
taper
while
a
voice
makes
lamentation
loud
and
dire
beneath
which
the
very
building
rocks
gawain
horse
shies
for
terror
and
the
knight
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
rides
out
of
the
chapel
to
find
the
storm
abated
and
the
great
wind
fallen
thereafter
the
night
was
calm
and
clear
in
the
perceval
section
of
wauchier
and
manessier
we
find
the
same
adventure
in
a
dislocated
form
perceval
seeking
the
grail
castle
rides
all
day
through
a
heavy
storm
which
passes
off
at
leaving
the
weather
calm
and
clear
he
rides
by
moonlight
through
the
forest
till
he
sees
before
him
a
great
oak
on
the
branches
of
which
are
lighted
candles
ten
fifteen
twenty
or
the
knight
rides
quickly
towards
it
but
as
he
comes
near
the
lights
vanish
and
he
only
sees
before
him
a
fair
little
chapel
with
a
candle
shining
through
the
open
door
he
enters
and
finds
on
the
altar
the
body
of
a
dead
knight
covered
with
a
rich
samite
a
candle
burning
at
his
feet
perceval
remains
some
time
but
nothing
happens
at
midnight
he
departs
scarcely
has
he
left
the
chapel
when
to
his
great
surprise
the
light
is
extinguished
the
next
day
he
reaches
the
castle
of
the
fisher
king
who
asks
him
where
he
passed
the
preceding
night
perceval
tells
him
of
the
chapel
the
king
sighs
deeply
but
makes
no
comment
wauchier
section
breaks
off
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
this
episode
when
manessier
takes
up
the
story
he
gives
explanations
of
the
grail
at
great
length
explanations
which
do
not
at
all
agree
with
the
indications
of
his
predecessor
when
perceval
asks
of
the
chapel
he
is
told
it
was
built
by
queen
brangemore
of
cornwall
who
was
later
murdered
by
her
son
espinogres
and
buried
beneath
the
altar
many
knights
have
since
been
slain
there
none
know
by
whom
save
it
be
by
the
black
hand
which
appeared
and
put
out
the
light
as
we
saw
above
it
had
not
appeared
the
enchantment
can
only
be
put
an
end
to
if
a
valiant
knight
will
fight
the
black
hand
and
taking
a
veil
kept
in
the
chapel
will
dip
it
in
holy
water
and
sprinkle
the
walls
after
which
the
enchantment
will
cease
at
a
much
later
point
manessier
tells
how
perceval
riding
through
the
forest
is
overtaken
by
a
terrible
storm
he
takes
refuge
in
a
chapel
which
he
recognizes
as
that
of
the
black
hand
the
hand
appears
perceval
fights
against
and
wounds
it
then
appears
a
head

the

full
form
who
seizes
perceval
as
he
is
about
to
seek
the
veil
of
which
he
has
been
told
perceval
makes
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
which
the
devil
vanishes
and
the
knight
falls
insensible
before
the
altar
on
reviving
he
takes
the
veil
dips
it
in
holy
water
and
sprinkles
the
walls
within
and
without
he
sleeps
there
that
night
and
the
next
morning
on
waking
sees
a
belfry
he
rings
the
bell
upon
which
an
old
man
followed
by
two
others
appears
he
tells
perceval
he
is
a
priest
and
has
buried
knights
slain
by
the
black
hand
every
day
a
knight
has
been
slain
and
every
day
a
marble
tomb
stands
ready
with
the
name
of
the
victim
upon
it
queen
brangemore
founded
the
cemetery
and
was
the
first
to
be
buried
within
it
but
according
to
the
version
given
earlier
she
was
buried
beneath
the
altar
we
have
here
evidently
a
combination
of
two
themes
perilous
chapel
and
perilous
cemetery
originally
independent
of
each
other
in
other
mss
the
wauchier
adventure
agrees
much
more
closely
with
the
manessier
sequel
the
hand
appearing
and
extinguishing
the
light
sometimes
the
hand
holds
a
bridle
a
feature
probably
due
to
contamination
with
a
celtic
in
which
a
mysterious
hand
here
that
of
a
giant
steals
on
their
a
child
and
a
foal
these
perceval
versions
are
manifestly
confused
and
dislocated
and
are
probably
drawn
from
more
than
one
source
in
the
queste
gawain
and
hector
de
maris
come
to
an
old
and
ruined
chapel
where
they
pass
the
night
each
has
a
marvellous
dream
the
next
morning
as
they
are
telling
each
other
their
respective
visions
they
see
a
hand
showing
unto
the
elbow
and
was
covered
with
red
samite
and
upon
that
hung
a
bridle
not
rich
and
held
within
the
fist
a
great
candle
that
burnt
right
clear
and
so
passed
afore
them
and
entered
into
the
chapel
and
then
vanished
away
and
they
wist
not
where
this
seems
to
be
an
unintelligent
borrowing
from
the
perceval
version
we
have
also
a
group
of
visits
to
the
perilous
chapel
or
perilous
cemetery
which
appear
to
be
closely
connected
with
each
other
in
each
case
the
object
of
the
visit
is
to
obtain
a
portion
of
the
cloth
which
covers
the
altar
or
a
dead
body
lying
upon
the
altar
the
romances
in
question
are
the
perlesvaus
the
prose
lancelot
and
the
chevalier
ŕ
deux
espées
the
respective
protagonists
being
sister
sir
lancelot
and
the
young
queen
of
garadigan
whose
city
has
been
taken
by
king
ris
and
who
dares
the
venture
to
win
her
freedom
in
the
first
case
the
peril
appears
to
lie
in
the
cemetery
which
is
surrounded
by
the
ghosts
of
knights
slain
in
the
forest
and
buried
in
unconsecrated
ground
the
lancelot
version
is
similar
but
here
the
title
is
definitely
perilous
chapel
in
the
last
version
there
is
no
hint
of
a
cemetery
in
the
lancelot
version
there
is
a
dead
knight
on
the
altar
whose
sword
lancelot
takes
in
addition
to
the
piece
of
cloth
in
the
poem
a
knight
is
brought
in
and
buried
before
the
altar
the
young
queen
after
cutting
off
a
piece
of
the
altar
cloth
uncovers
the
body
and
buckles
on
the
sword
there
is
no
mention
of
a
hand
in
any
of
the
three
versions
which
appear
to
be
late
and
emasculated
forms
of
the
theme
the
earliest
mention
of
a
perilous
cemetery
as
distinct
from
a
chapel
appears
to
be
in
the
chastel
orguellous
section
of
the
perceval
a
section
probably
derived
from
a
very
early
stratum
of
arthurian
romantic
tradition
here
arthur
and
his
knights
on
their
way
to
the
siege
of
chastel
orguellous
come
to
the
vergier
des
sepoltures
where
they
eat
with
the
hermits
of
whom
there
are
a
hundred
and
more

but
there
is
no
hint
of
a
perilous
chapel
here
the
adventures
of
gawain
in
the
atre
perilleus
and
of
gawain
and
hector
in
the
lancelot
of
the
final
cyclic
prose
version
are
of
the
most
banal
description
the
theme
originally
vivid
and
picturesque
has
become
watered
down
into
a
meaningless
adventure
of
the
most
conventional
type
but
originally
a
high
importance
seems
to
have
been
attached
to
it
if
we
turn
back
to
the
first
version
given
that
of
which
gawain
is
the
hero
we
shall
find
that
special
stress
is
laid
on
this
adventure
as
being
part
of
secret
of
the
grail
of
which
no
man
may
speak
without
grave
danger
we
are
told
that
but
for
gawain
loyalty
and
courtesy
he
would
not
have
survived
the
perils
of
that
night
in
the
same
way
perceval
before
reaching
the
fisher
king
castle
meets
a
maiden
of
whom
he
asks
the
meaning
of
the
lighted
tree
chapel
etc
she
tells
him
it
is
all
part
of
the
saint
secret
of
the
grail
now
what
does
this
mean
unless
i
am
much
mistaken
the
key
is
to
be
found
in
a
very
curious
story
related
in
the
perlesvaus
which
is
twice
referred
to
in
texts
of
a
professedly
historical
character
the
tale
runs
thus
king
arthur
has
fallen
into
slothful
and
fainéant
ways
much
to
the
grief
of
guenevere
who
sees
her
lord
fame
and
prestige
waning
day
by
day
in
this
crisis
she
urges
him
to
visit
the
chapel
of
saint
austin
a
perilous
adventure
but
one
that
may
well
restore
his
reputation
arthur
agrees
he
will
take
with
him
only
one
squire
the
place
is
too
dangerous
he
calls
a
youth
named
chaus
the
son
of
yvain
the
bastard
and
bids
him
be
ready
to
ride
with
him
at
dawn
the
lad
fearful
of
does
not
undress
but
lies
down
as
he
is
in
the
hall
he
falls
asleep
and
it
seems
to
him
that
the
king
has
wakened
and
gone
without
him
he
rises
in
haste
mounts
and
rides
after
arthur
following
as
he
thinks
the
track
of
his
steed
thus
he
comes
to
a
forest
glade
where
he
sees
a
chapel
set
in
the
midst
of
a
he
enters
but
the
king
is
not
there
there
is
no
living
thing
only
the
body
of
a
knight
on
a
bier
with
tapers
burning
in
golden
candlesticks
at
head
and
foot
chaus
takes
out
one
of
the
tapers
and
thrusting
the
golden
candlestick
betwixt
hose
and
thigh
remounts
and
rides
back
in
search
of
the
king
before
he
has
gone
far
he
meets
a
man
black
and
armed
with
a
large
knife
he
asks
has
he
met
king
arthur
the
man
answers
no
but
he
has
met
him
chaus
he
is
a
thief
and
a
traitor
he
has
stolen
the
golden
candlestick
unless
he
gives
it
up
he
shall
pay
for
it
dearly
chaus
refuses
and
the
man
smites
him
in
the
side
with
the
knife
with
a
loud
cry
the
lad
awakes
he
is
lying
in
the
hall
at
cardoil
wounded
to
death
the
knife
in
his
side
and
the
golden
candlestick
still
in
his
hose
he
lives
long
enough
to
tell
the
story
confess
and
be
shriven
and
then
dies
arthur
with
the
consent
of
his
father
gives
the
candlestick
to
the
church
of
saint
paul
then
newly
founded
for
he
would
that
this
marvellous
adventure
should
everywhere
be
known
and
that
prayer
should
be
made
for
the
soul
of
the
squire
the
pious
wish
of
the
king
seems
to
have
been
fulfilled
as
the
story
was
certainly
well
known
and
appears
to
have
been
accepted
as
a
genuine
tradition
thus
the
author
of
the
histoire
de
fulk
gives
a
résumé
of
the
adventure
and
asserts
that
the
chapel
of
saint
austin
referred
to
was
situated
in
fulk
patrimony
in
the
tract
known
as
the
blaunche
launde
situated
in
shropshire
on
the
border
of
north
wales
as
source
for
the
tale
he
refers
to
le
graal
le
lyvre
de
le
seint
vassal
and
goes
on
to
state
that
here
king
arthur
recovered
sa
bounté
et
sa
valur
when
he
had
lost
his
knighthood
and
fame
this
obviously
refers
to
the
perlesvaus
romance
though
whether
in
its
present
or
in
an
earlier
form
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
any
case
the
author
of
the
histoire
evidently
thought
that
the
chapel
in
question
really
existed
and
was
to
be
located
in
shropshire
but
john
of
glastonbury
also
refers
to
the
story
and
he
connects
it
with
glastonbury
now
how
can
we
account
for
so
wild
and
at
first
sight
so
improbable
a
tale
assuming
what
we
may
term
a
character
and
becoming
connected
with
a
definite
and
precise
locality
a
feature
which
is
as
a
rule
absent
from
the
grail
stories
at
the
risk
of
startling
my
readers
i
must
express
my
opinion
that
it
was
because
the
incidents
recorded
were
a
reminiscence
of
something
which
had
actually
happened
and
which
owing
to
the
youth
and
possible
social
position
of
the
victim
had
made
a
profound
impression
upon
the
popular
imagination
for
this
is
the
story
of
an
initiation
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
the
test
of
fitness
for
an
initiation
carried
out
on
the
astral
plane
and
reacting
with
fatal
results
upon
the
physical
we
have
already
seen
in
the
naassene
document
that
the
mystery
ritual
comprised
a
double
initiation
the
lower
into
the
mysteries
of
generation
of
physical
life
the
higher
into
the
spiritual
divine
life
where
man
is
made
one
with
god
some
years
ago
i
offered
the
suggestion
that
the
test
for
the
primary
initiation
that
into
the
sources
of
physical
life
would
probably
consist
in
a
contact
with
the
horrors
of
physical
death
and
that
the
tradition
of
the
perilous
chapel
which
survives
in
the
grail
romances
in
confused
and
contaminated
form
was
a
reminiscence
of
the
test
for
this
lower
initiation
this
would
fully
account
for
the
importance
ascribed
to
it
in
the
form
and
for
the
asserted
connection
with
the
grail
it
was
not
till
i
came
to
study
the
version
of
the
perlesvaus
with
a
view
to
determining
its
original
provenance
that
i
recognized
its
extreme
importance
for
critical
purposes
the
more
one
studies
this
wonderful
legend
the
more
one
discovers
significance
in
what
seem
at
first
to
be
entirely
independent
and
unrelated
details
if
the
reader
will
refer
to
my
notes
on
the
perlesvaus
above
referred
to
he
will
find
that
the
result
of
an
investigation
into
the
evidence
for
locale
pointed
to
the
conclusion
that
the
author
of
the
histoire
de
fulk
and
most
probably
also
the
author
of
the
perlesvaus
before
him
were
mistaken
in
their
identification
that
there
was
no
tradition
of
any
such
chapel
in
shropshire
and
consequently
no
tale
of
its
foundation
such
as
the
author
of
the
histoire
relates
but
i
was
also
able
to
show
that
further
north
in
northumberland
there
was
also
a
blanchland
connected
with
the
memory
of
king
arthur
numerous
dedications
to
saint
austin
and
a
tradition
of
that
saint
driving
out
the
local
demons
closely
analogous
to
the
tale
told
of
the
presumed
shropshire
site
i
therefore
suggested
that
inasmuch
as
the
perlesvaus
represented
arthur
as
holding
his
court
at
cardoil
carlisle
the
northern
blanchland
which
possessed
a
chapel
of
saint
austin
and
lay
within
easy
reach
was
probably
the
original
site
rather
than
the
shropshire
blaunche
launde
which
had
no
chapel
and
was
much
further
away
now
in
view
of
the
evidence
set
forth
in
the
last
chapter
is
it
not
clear
that
this
was
a
locality
in
which
these
rites
might
prima
facie
be
expected
to
linger
on
it
is
up
here
along
the
northern
border
that
the
roman
legionaries
were
stationed
it
is
here
that
we
find
monuments
and
memorials
of
their
heathen
cults
obviously
this
was
a
locality
where
the
activities
of
the
saint
might
find
full
scope
for
action
i
would
submit
that
there
is
at
least
presumptive
evidence
that
we
may
here
be
dealing
with
the
survival
of
a
genuine
tradition
and
should
any
of
my
readers
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
even
did
initiations
take
place
and
even
were
they
of
a
character
that
involved
a
stern
test
of
mental
and
physical
endurance
and
i
imagine
most
scholars
would
admit
that
there
was
possibly
more
in
the
original
institutions
than
let
us
say
in
a
modern
admission
to
yet
it
is
far
cry
from
initiations
to
medieval
romance
and
a
connection
between
the
two
is
a
rash
postulate
i
would
draw
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
quite
apart
from
our
grail
texts
we
possess
a
romance
which
is
plainly
and
blatantly
nothing
more
or
less
than
such
a
record
i
refer
of
course
to
owain
miles
or
the
purgatory
of
saint
patrick
where
we
have
an
account
of
the
hero
after
purification
by
fasting
and
prayer
descending
into
the
nether
world
passing
through
the
abodes
of
the
lost
finally
reaching
paradise
and
returning
to
earth
after
three
days
a
reformed
and
regenerated
character
then
with
his
monks
the
prior
anon
with
crosses
and
with
gonfanon
went
to
that
hole
forthright
thro
which
knight
owain
went
below
there
as
of
burning
fire
the
glow
they
saw
a
gleam
of
light
and
right
amidst
that
beam
of
light
he
came
up
owain
god
own
knight
by
this
knew
every
man
that
he
in
paradise
had
been
and
purgatory
pains
had
seen
and
was
a
holy
man
now
if
we
turn
to
bousset
article
himmelfahrt
der
seele
to
which
i
have
previously
referred
we
shall
find
abundant
evidence
that
such
a
journey
to
the
worlds
beyond
was
held
to
be
a
high
spiritual
adventure
of
actual
possibility
a
venture
to
be
undertaken
by
those
who
greatly
daring
felt
that
the
attainment
of
actual
knowledge
of
the
future
life
was
worth
all
the
risks
and
they
were
great
and
terrible
which
such
an
enterprise
involved
bousset
comments
fully
on
saint
paul
claim
to
have
been
up
into
the
third
heaven
and
points
out
that
such
an
experience
was
the
property
of
the
rabbinical
school
to
which
saul
of
tarsus
had
belonged
and
was
brought
over
by
him
from
his
jewish
past
such
experiences
were
rare
in
orthodox
christianity
according
to
jewish
classical
tradition
but
one
rabbi
had
successfully
passed
the
test
other
aspirants
either
failing
at
a
preliminary
stage
or
if
they
persevered
losing
their
senses
permanently
the
practice
of
this
ecstatic
ascent
ceased
among
jews
in
the
second
century
bousset
also
gives
instances
of
the
soul
leaving
the
body
for
three
days
and
wandering
through
other
worlds
both
good
and
evil
and
also
discusses
the
origin
of
the
bridge
which
must
be
crossed
to
reach
paradise
both
features
characteristic
of
the
owain
poem
in
fact
the
whole
study
is
of
immense
importance
for
a
critical
analysis
of
the
sources
of
the
romance
in
question
and
here
i
would
venture
to
beg
the
adherents
of
the
school
to
use
a
little
more
judgment
in
their
attribution
of
sources
visits
to
the
otherworld
are
not
always
derivations
from
celtic
unless
i
am
mistaken
the
root
of
this
theme
is
far
more
deeply
imbedded
than
in
the
shifting
sands
of
folk
and
fairy
tale
i
believe
it
to
be
essentially
a
mystery
tradition
the
otherworld
is
not
a
myth
but
a
reality
and
in
all
ages
there
have
been
souls
who
have
been
willing
to
brave
the
great
adventure
and
to
risk
all
for
the
chance
of
bringing
back
with
them
some
assurance
of
the
future
life
naturally
these
ventures
passed
into
tradition
with
the
men
who
risked
them
the
early
races
of
men
became
their
beliefs
their
experiences
receded
into
a
land
of
mist
where
their
figures
assumed
fantastic
outlines
and
the
record
of
their
deeds
departed
more
and
more
widely
from
historic
accuracy
the
poets
and
dreamers
wove
their
magic
webs
and
a
world
apart
from
the
world
of
actual
experience
came
to
life
but
it
was
not
all
myth
nor
all
fantasy
there
was
a
basis
of
truth
and
reality
at
the
foundation
of
the
mystic
growth
and
a
true
criticism
will
not
rest
content
with
wandering
in
these
enchanted
lands
and
holding
all
it
meets
with
for
the
outcome
of
human
imagination
the
truth
may
lie
very
deep
down
but
it
is
there
and
it
is
worth
seeking
and
celtic
charming
as
they
are
can
never
afford
a
satisfactory
or
abiding
resting
place
i
for
one
utterly
refuse
to
accept
such
as
an
adequate
goal
for
a
life
research
a
path
that
leads
but
into
a
celtic
twilight
can
only
be
a
and
not
the
king
highway
the
grail
romances
repose
eventually
not
upon
a
poet
imagination
but
upon
the
ruins
of
an
august
and
ancient
ritual
a
ritual
which
once
claimed
to
be
the
accredited
guardian
of
the
deepest
secrets
of
life
driven
from
its
high
estate
by
the
relentless
force
of
religious
evolution
for
after
all
adonis
attis
and
their
congeners
were
but
the
who
must
needs
yield
place
when
themselves
arrive
it
yet
lingered
on
openly
in
folk
practice
in
fast
and
feast
whereby
the
of
the
land
might
be
assured
secretly
in
cave
or
or
island
isolation
where
those
who
craved
for
a
more
sensible
not
necessarily
sensuous
contact
with
the
unseen
spiritual
forces
of
life
than
the
orthodox
development
of
christianity
afforded
might
and
did
find
satisfaction
were
the
templars
such
had
they
when
in
the
east
come
into
touch
with
a
survival
of
the
naassene
or
some
kindred
sect
it
seems
exceedingly
probable
if
it
were
so
we
could
understand
at
once
the
puzzling
connection
of
the
order
with
the
knights
of
the
grail
and
the
doom
which
fell
upon
them
that
they
were
held
to
be
heretics
is
very
generally
admitted
but
in
what
their
heresy
consisted
no
one
really
knows
little
credence
can
be
attached
to
the
stories
of
idol
worship
often
repeated
if
their
heresy
however
were
such
as
indicated
above
a
creed
which
struck
at
the
very
root
and
vitals
of
christianity
we
can
understand
at
once
the
reason
for
punishment
and
the
necessity
for
secrecy
in
the
same
way
we
can
now
understand
why
the
church
knows
nothing
of
the
grail
why
that
vessel
surrounded
as
it
is
with
an
atmosphere
of
reverence
and
awe
equated
with
the
central
sacrament
of
the
christian
faith
yet
appears
in
no
legendary
is
figured
in
no
picture
comes
on
the
scene
in
no
passion
play
the
church
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
centuries
knew
well
what
the
grail
was
and
we
when
we
realize
its
genesis
and
true
lineage
need
no
longer
wonder
why
a
theme
for
some
short
space
so
famous
and
so
fruitful
a
source
of
literary
inspiration
vanished
utterly
and
completely
from
the
world
of
literature
were
grail
romances
forbidden
or
were
they
merely
discouraged
probably
we
shall
never
know
but
of
this
one
thing
we
may
be
sure
the
grail
is
a
living
force
it
will
never
die
it
may
indeed
sink
out
of
sight
and
for
centuries
even
disappear
from
the
field
of
literature
but
it
will
rise
to
the
surface
again
and
become
once
more
a
theme
of
vital
inspiration
even
as
after
slumbering
from
the
days
of
malory
it
woke
to
new
life
in
the
nineteenth
century
making
its
fresh
appeal
through
the
genius
of
tennyson
and
wagner
chapter
xiv
the
author
having
now
completed
our
survey
of
the
various
elements
which
have
entered
into
the
composite
fabric
of
the
grail
legend
the
question
naturally
arises
where
and
when
did
that
legend
assume
romantic
form
and
to
whom
should
we
ascribe
its
literary
origin
on
these
crucial
points
the
evidence
at
our
disposal
is
far
from
complete
and
we
can
do
little
more
than
offer
suggestions
towards
the
solution
of
the
problem
with
regard
to
the
first
point
that
of
locality
the
evidence
is
unmistakably
in
favour
of
a
celtic
specifically
a
welsh
source
as
a
literary
theme
the
grail
is
closely
connected
with
the
arthurian
tradition
the
protagonist
is
one
of
arthur
knights
and
the
hero
of
the
earlier
version
gawain
is
more
closely
connected
with
arthur
than
are
his
successors
perceval
and
galahad
the
celtic
origin
of
both
gawain
and
perceval
is
beyond
doubt
and
the
latter
is
not
merely
a
celt
but
is
definitely
welsh
he
is
always
gallois
galahad
i
hold
to
be
a
literary
and
not
a
traditional
hero
he
is
the
product
of
deliberate
literary
invention
and
has
no
existence
outside
the
frame
of
the
later
cyclic
redactions
it
is
not
possible
at
the
present
moment
to
say
whether
the
queste
was
composed
in
the
british
isles
or
on
the
continent
but
we
may
safely
lay
it
down
as
a
basic
principle
that
the
original
grail
heroes
are
of
insular
origin
and
that
the
grail
legend
in
its
romantic
and
literary
form
is
closely
connected
with
british
tradition
the
beliefs
and
practices
of
which
if
the
theory
maintained
in
these
pages
be
correct
the
grail
stories
offer
a
more
or
less
coherent
survival
can
be
shown
on
the
evidence
of
historic
monuments
and
surviving
to
have
been
popular
throughout
the
area
of
the
british
isles
while
with
regard
to
the
higher
teaching
of
which
i
hold
these
practices
to
have
been
the
vehicle
pliny
comments
upon
the
similarity
existing
between
the
ancient
magian
gnosis
and
the
druidical
gnosis
of
gaul
and
britain
an
indication
which
in
the
dearth
of
accurate
information
concerning
the
teaching
of
the
druids
is
of
considerable
value
as
we
noted
in
the
previous
chapter
an
interesting
parallel
exists
between
wales
and
localities
such
as
the
alps
and
the
vosges
where
we
have
definite
proof
that
these
mystery
cults
lingered
on
after
they
had
disappeared
from
public
celebration
the
chart
appended
to
cumont
monuments
de
mithra
shows
mithraic
remains
in
precisely
the
locality
where
we
have
reason
to
believe
certain
of
the
gawain
and
perceval
stories
to
have
originated
as
to
the
date
of
origin
that
of
course
is
closely
connected
with
the
problem
of
authorship
if
we
can
with
any
possibility
identify
the
author
we
can
approximately
fix
the
date
so
far
as
the
literary
evidence
is
concerned
we
have
no
trace
of
the
story
before
the
twelfth
century
but
when
we
do
meet
with
it
it
is
already
in
complete
and
crystallized
form
more
there
is
already
evidence
of
competing
versions
we
have
no
existing
grail
romance
which
we
can
claim
to
be
free
from
contamination
and
representing
in
all
respects
the
original
form
there
is
no
need
here
to
go
over
old
and
ground
in
my
studies
of
the
perceval
legend
and
in
the
later
popular
résumé
of
the
evidence
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
i
have
analysed
the
texts
and
shown
that
while
the
poem
of
chrétien
de
troyes
is
our
earliest
surviving
literary
version
there
is
the
strongest
possible
evidence
that
chrétien
as
he
himself
admits
was
not
inventing
but
an
already
popular
tale
the
grail
quest
was
a
theme
which
had
been
treated
not
once
nor
twice
but
of
which
numerous
and
conflicting
versions
were
already
current
and
when
wauchier
de
denain
undertook
to
complete
chrétien
unfinished
work
he
drew
largely
upon
these
already
existing
forms
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
not
only
contradicted
the
version
they
were
ostensibly
completing
but
were
impossible
to
harmonize
with
each
other
it
is
of
importance
for
our
investigation
however
to
note
that
where
wauchier
does
refer
to
a
definite
source
it
is
to
an
evidently
important
and
already
famous
collection
of
tales
le
grant
conte
comprising
several
the
hero
of
the
collection
being
not
chrétien
hero
perceval
but
gawain
who
both
in
and
romantic
tradition
is
far
more
closely
connected
with
the
arthurian
legend
occupying
as
he
does
the
traditional
position
of
nephew
sister
son
to
the
monarch
who
is
the
centre
of
the
cycle
even
as
cuchullinn
is
sister
son
to
conchobar
diarmid
to
finn
tristan
to
mark
and
roland
to
charlemagne
in
fact
this
relationship
was
so
obviously
required
by
tradition
that
we
find
perceval
figuring
now
as
sister
son
to
arthur
now
to
the
grail
king
according
as
the
arthurian
or
the
grail
tradition
dominates
the
story
the
actual
existence
of
such
a
group
of
tales
as
those
referred
to
by
wauchier
derives
confirmation
from
our
surviving
gawain
poems
as
well
as
from
the
references
in
the
elucidation
and
on
the
evidence
at
our
disposal
i
have
ventured
to
suggest
the
hypothesis
of
a
group
of
poems
dealing
with
the
adventures
of
gawain
his
son
and
brother
the
ensemble
being
originally
known
as
the
geste
of
syr
gawayne
a
title
which
in
the
inappropriate
form
the
jest
of
sir
gawain
is
preserved
in
the
english
version
of
that
hero
adventure
with
the
sister
of
brandelis
so
keen
a
critic
as
dr
brugger
has
not
hesitated
to
accept
the
theory
of
the
existence
of
this
geste
and
is
of
opinion
that
the
german
poem
diű
crône
may
in
part
at
least
be
derived
from
this
source
the
central
adventure
ascribed
to
gawain
in
this
group
of
tales
is
precisely
the
visit
to
the
grail
castle
to
which
we
have
already
referred
and
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
manner
in
which
it
is
related
its
directness
simplicity
and
conformity
with
what
we
know
of
the
mystery
teaching
presumably
involved
taken
in
connection
with
the
personality
of
the
hero
and
his
position
in
arthurian
romantic
tradition
appear
to
warrant
us
in
assigning
to
it
the
position
of
priority
among
the
conflicting
versions
we
possess
at
two
points
in
the
of
these
gawain
tales
wauchier
definitely
refers
to
the
author
by
name
bleheris
on
the
second
occasion
he
states
categorically
that
this
bleheris
was
of
welsh
birth
and
origin
né
et
engenuďs
en
galles
and
that
he
told
the
tale
in
connection
with
which
the
statement
is
made
to
a
certain
comte
de
poitiers
whose
favourite
story
it
was
he
loved
it
above
all
others
which
would
imply
that
it
was
not
the
only
tale
bleheris
had
told
him
as
we
have
seen
in
a
previous
chapter
the
elucidation
prefaces
its
account
of
the
grail
quest
by
a
solemn
statement
of
the
gravity
of
the
subject
to
be
treated
and
a
warning
of
the
penalties
which
would
follow
on
a
careless
revelation
of
the
secret
these
warnings
are
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
certain
master
blihis
concerning
whom
we
hear
no
more
a
little
further
on
in
the
poem
we
meet
with
a
knight
who
made
prisoner
by
gawain
reveals
to
arthur
and
his
court
the
identity
of
the
maidens
wandering
in
the
woods
of
the
fisher
king
and
the
grail
and
is
so
good
a
that
none
can
weary
of
listening
to
his
tales
again
in
the
fragmentary
remains
of
thomas
tristan
we
have
a
passage
in
which
the
poet
refers
as
source
to
a
certain
bréri
who
knew
all
the
feats
and
all
the
tales
of
all
the
kings
and
all
the
counts
who
had
lived
in
britain
finally
giraldus
cambrensis
refers
to
famosus
ille
fabulator
bledhericus
who
had
lived
shortly
before
our
time
and
whose
renown
he
evidently
takes
for
granted
was
familiar
to
his
readers
now
are
we
to
hold
that
the
bleheris
who
according
to
wauchier
had
told
tales
concerning
gawain
and
arthur
court
one
of
whic
tales
was
certainly
the
grail
adventure
the
master
blihis
who
knew
the
grail
mystery
and
gave
solemn
warning
against
its
revelation
the
who
knew
the
grail
and
many
other
tales
the
bréri
who
knew
all
the
legendary
tales
concerning
the
princes
of
britain
and
the
famous
bledhericus
of
whom
giraldus
speaks
are
distinct
and
separate
personages
or
mere
inventions
of
the
separate
writers
or
do
all
these
passages
refer
to
one
and
the
same
individual
who
in
that
case
may
well
have
deserved
the
title
famosus
ille
fabulator
with
regard
to
the
attitude
taken
up
by
certain
critics
that
no
evidential
value
can
be
attached
to
these
references
i
would
point
out
that
when
medieval
writers
quote
an
authority
for
their
statements
they
as
a
rule
refer
to
a
writer
whose
name
carries
weight
and
will
impress
their
readers
they
are
offering
a
guarantee
for
the
authenticity
of
their
statements
the
special
attribution
may
be
purely
fictitious
but
the
individual
referred
to
enjoys
an
established
reputation
thus
the
later
cyclic
redactions
of
the
arthurian
romances
are
largely
attributed
to
walter
map
who
in
view
of
his
public
position
and
political
activities
could
certainly
never
have
had
the
leisure
to
compose
one
half
of
the
literature
with
which
he
is
credited
in
the
same
way
robert
de
borron
chrétien
de
troyes
wolfram
von
eschenbach
are
all
referred
to
as
sources
without
any
justification
in
fact
nor
is
it
probable
that
wauchier
who
wrote
on
the
continent
and
who
if
he
be
really
wauchier
de
denain
was
under
the
patronage
of
the
count
of
flanders
would
have
gone
out
of
his
way
to
invent
a
welsh
source
judging
from
analogy
the
actual
existence
of
a
personage
named
bleheris
who
enjoyed
a
remarkable
reputation
as
a
is
prima
facie
extremely
probable
but
are
these
references
independent
was
there
more
than
one
bleheris
i
think
not
the
name
is
a
proper
and
not
a
family
name
in
the
latter
case
it
might
be
possible
to
argue
that
we
were
dealing
with
separate
members
of
a
family
or
group
of
bardic
poets
whose
office
it
was
to
preserve
and
relate
the
national
legends
but
we
are
dealing
with
variants
of
a
proper
name
and
that
of
distinctly
insular
and
welsh
origin
the
original
form
bledri
was
by
no
means
uncommon
in
wales
from
that
point
of
view
there
might
well
have
been
four
or
five
or
even
more
of
that
name
but
that
each
and
all
of
these
should
have
possessed
the
same
qualifications
should
have
been
equally
well
versed
in
popular
traditions
equally
dowered
with
the
gift
of
on
equally
friendly
terms
with
the
norman
invaders
and
equally
possessed
of
such
a
knowledge
of
the
french
language
as
should
permit
them
to
tell
their
stories
in
that
tongue
is
i
submit
highly
improbable
this
latter
point
the
knowledge
of
french
seems
to
me
to
be
of
crucial
importance
given
the
relations
between
conqueror
and
conquered
and
the
intransigeant
character
of
welsh
patriotism
the
men
who
were
on
sufficiently
friendly
terms
with
the
invaders
to
be
willing
to
relate
the
national
legends
with
an
assurance
of
finding
a
sympathetic
hearing
must
have
been
few
and
far
between
i
do
not
think
the
importance
of
this
point
has
been
sufficiently
grasped
by
critics
the
problem
then
is
to
find
a
welshman
who
living
at
the
end
of
the
eleventh
and
commencement
of
the
twelfth
centuries
was
well
versed
in
the
legendary
lore
of
britain
was
of
sufficiently
good
social
status
to
be
well
received
at
court
possessed
a
good
knowledge
of
the
french
tongue
and
can
be
shown
to
have
been
on
friendly
terms
with
the
norman
nobles
mr
edward
owen
of
the
cymmrodorion
society
has
suggested
that
a
certain
welsh
noble
bledri
ap
cadivor
fulfils
in
a
large
measure
the
conditions
required
some
years
ago
i
published
in
the
revue
celtique
a
letter
in
which
mr
owen
summarized
the
evidence
at
his
disposal
as
the
review
in
question
may
not
be
easily
accessible
to
some
of
my
readers
i
will
recapitulate
the
principal
points
the
father
of
bledri
cadivor
was
a
great
personage
in
west
wales
and
is
looked
upon
as
the
ancestor
of
the
most
important
families
in
the
ancient
dyfed
a
division
now
represented
by
pembrokeshire
and
the
western
portion
of
carmarthen
we
may
note
here
that
the
traditional
tomb
of
gawain
is
at
ross
in
pembrokeshire
and
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
perceval
story
in
its
earliest
form
was
connected
with
that
locality
cadivor
had
three
sons
of
whom
bledri
was
the
eldest
thus
at
his
father
death
he
would
be
head
of
this
ancient
and
distinguished
family
at
the
division
of
the
paternal
estates
bledri
inherited
as
his
share
lands
ranging
along
the
right
bank
of
the
lower
towey
and
the
coast
of
south
pembrokeshire
extending
as
far
as
manorbeer
the
birthplace
of
giraldus
cambrensis
this
is
again
a
geographical
indication
which
should
be
borne
in
mind
cadivor
himself
appears
to
have
been
on
friendly
terms
with
the
normans
he
is
said
to
have
entertained
william
the
conqueror
on
his
visit
to
st
david
in
while
every
reference
we
have
to
bledri
shows
him
in
close
connection
with
the
invaders
thus
in
the
mentions
his
name
as
ally
of
the
norman
knights
in
their
struggle
to
maintain
their
ground
in
and
around
carmarthen
in
we
find
his
name
as
donor
of
lands
to
the
augustinian
church
of
st
john
the
evangelist
and
st
theuloc
of
carmarthen
newly
founded
by
henry
i
here
his
name
appears
with
the
significant
title
latinarius
the
interpreter
a
qualification
repeated
in
subsequent
charters
of
the
same
collection
in
one
of
these
we
find
griffith
the
son
of
bledri
confirming
his
gift
professor
lloyd
in
an
article
in
archaeologia
cambrensis
july
has
examined
these
charters
and
considers
the
grant
to
have
been
made
between
and
the
charter
itself
being
of
the
reign
of
henry
i
in
the
pipe
roll
of
henry
i
bledri
name
is
entered
as
debtor
for
a
fine
incurred
by
the
killing
of
a
fleming
by
his
men
while
a
highly
significant
entry
records
the
fine
of
marks
imposed
upon
a
certain
bleddyn
of
mabedrud
and
his
brothers
for
outraging
daughter
when
we
take
into
consideration
the
rank
of
bledri
this
insult
to
his
family
by
a
fellow
welshman
would
seem
to
indicate
that
his
relations
with
his
compatriots
were
not
of
a
specially
friendly
character
mr
owen
also
points
out
that
portion
of
the
which
covers
the
years
especially
the
events
of
the
year
where
we
find
bledri
and
other
friendly
welsh
nobles
holding
the
castle
of
carmarthen
for
the
normans
against
the
welsh
is
related
at
an
altogether
disproportionate
length
and
displays
a
strong
bias
in
favour
of
the
invaders
the
year
just
referred
to
for
instance
occupies
more
than
twice
the
space
assigned
to
any
other
year
mr
owen
suggests
that
here
bledri
himself
may
well
have
been
the
chronicler
a
hypothesis
which
if
he
really
be
the
author
we
are
seeking
is
quite
admissible
so
far
as
indications
of
date
are
concerned
bledri
probably
lived
between
the
years
his
father
cadivor
died
in
and
his
lands
were
divided
between
his
sons
of
whom
bledri
as
we
have
seen
was
the
eldest
thus
they
can
not
have
been
children
at
that
date
bledri
at
least
would
have
been
born
before
from
the
evidence
of
the
pipe
roll
we
know
that
he
was
living
in
the
charter
signed
by
his
son
confirmatory
of
his
grant
must
have
been
subsequent
to
as
it
was
executed
during
the
episcopate
of
david
bishop
of
st
david
thus
the
period
of
years
suggested
above
may
be
taken
as
covering
the
extreme
limit
to
be
assigned
to
his
life
and
activity
the
passage
in
which
giraldus
cambrensis
refers
to
bledhericus
famosus
ille
fabulator
who
tempora
nostra
paulo
praevenit
was
written
about
thus
it
might
well
refer
to
a
man
who
had
died
some
or
years
previously
as
we
have
noted
above
giraldus
was
born
upon
ground
forming
a
part
of
bledri
ancestral
heritage
and
thus
might
well
be
familiar
with
his
fame
the
evidence
is
of
course
incomplete
but
it
does
provide
us
with
a
personality
fulfilling
the
main
conditions
of
a
complex
problem
thus
we
have
a
man
of
the
required
name
and
nationality
living
at
an
appropriate
date
of
the
requisite
social
position
on
excellent
terms
with
the
french
nobles
and
so
well
acquainted
with
their
language
as
to
sign
himself
officially
interpreter
we
have
no
direct
evidence
of
his
literary
skill
or
knowledge
of
the
traditional
history
of
his
country
but
a
man
of
his
birth
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
possess
the
latter
while
certain
peculiarities
in
that
section
of
the
national
chronicle
which
deals
with
the
aid
given
by
him
to
the
norman
invaders
would
seem
to
indicate
that
bledri
himself
may
well
have
been
responsible
for
the
record
again
we
know
him
to
have
been
closely
connected
with
the
locality
from
which
came
the
writer
who
refers
to
the
famous
of
the
same
name
i
would
submit
that
we
have
here
quite
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
us
in
accepting
bledri
ap
cadivor
as
at
least
the
possible
author
of
the
romantic
grail
tradition
in
any
case
so
far
there
is
no
other
candidate
in
the
field
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
second
volume
of
my
perceval
studies
i
received
a
letter
from
professor
singer
in
which
after
expressing
his
general
acceptance
of
the
theories
there
advanced
in
especial
of
the
suggested
date
and
relation
of
the
different
versions
which
he
characterized
as
sehr
gelungen
und
zu
meiner
alffassung
der
entwickelung
der
altfranzösischen
literatur
sehr
zu
stimmen
he
proceeded
to
comment
upon
the
probable
character
of
the
literary
activity
of
bleheris
his
remarks
are
so
interesting
and
suggestive
that
i
venture
to
submit
them
for
the
consideration
of
my
readers
professor
singer
points
out
that
in
eilhart
von
oberge
tristan
we
find
the
name
in
the
form
of
pleherin
attached
to
a
knight
of
court
the
same
name
in
a
slightly
varied
form
pfelerin
occurs
in
the
tristan
of
heinrich
von
freiberg
both
poems
professor
singer
considers
are
derived
from
a
french
original
under
a
compound
form
blihos
or
blio
he
appears
in
the
compilation
as
a
knight
at
arthur
court
now
is
referred
to
as
authority
alike
in
the
tristan
grail
and
gawain
tradition
and
professor
singer
makes
the
interesting
suggestion
that
these
references
are
originally
due
to
bleheris
himself
who
not
only
told
the
stories
in
the
third
person
a
common
device
at
that
period
chrétien
erec
and
gerbert
continuation
of
the
perceval
but
also
introduced
himself
as
of
and
actor
in
a
subordinate
rôle
in
the
incidents
he
recorded
thus
in
the
tristan
he
is
a
knight
of
mark
in
the
elucidation
and
the
gawain
stories
a
knight
of
arthur
court
professor
singer
instances
the
case
of
dares
in
the
de
exidio
trojae
and
bishop
pilgrim
of
passau
in
the
lost
nibelungias
of
his
secretary
konrad
as
illustrations
of
the
theory
if
this
be
the
case
such
a
statement
as
that
which
we
find
in
wauchier
regarding
bleheris
birth
and
origin
would
have
emanated
from
bleheris
himself
and
simply
been
taken
over
by
the
later
writer
from
his
source
he
incorporated
the
whole
tale
of
the
shield
as
it
stood
a
quite
natural
and
normal
proceeding
again
this
suggestion
would
do
away
with
the
necessity
for
postulating
a
certain
lapse
of
time
before
the
bleheris
could
be
converted
into
an
arthurian
knight
the
two
rôles
gewährsmann
und
mithandelnden
as
professor
singer
expresses
it
are
coincident
in
date
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
double
form
would
have
been
adopted
by
the
author
himself
to
indicate
the
identity
of
the
two
blihis
and
bleheris
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
when
dealing
directly
with
the
grail
he
assumes
the
title
of
master
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
here
he
claimed
to
speak
with
special
authority
i
sent
the
letter
in
question
to
the
late
mr
alfred
nutt
who
was
forcibly
struck
with
the
possibilities
involved
in
the
suggestion
the
full
application
of
which
he
thought
the
writer
had
not
grasped
i
quote
the
following
passages
from
the
long
letter
i
received
from
him
in
return
briefly
put
we
presuppose
the
existence
of
a
set
of
poems
in
which
a
bledri
figures
as
an
active
and
at
the
same
time
a
recording
personage
now
that
such
a
body
of
literature
may
have
existed
we
are
entitled
to
assume
from
the
fact
that
two
such
have
survived
one
from
wales
in
the
llywarch
hen
cycle
the
other
from
ireland
in
the
finn
saga
in
both
cases
the
fact
that
the
descriptive
poems
are
put
in
the
mouth
in
wales
of
llywarch
in
ireland
largely
of
oisin
led
to
the
ascription
at
an
early
date
of
the
whole
literature
to
llywarch
and
oisin
it
is
therefore
conceivable
that
a
welsh
familiar
as
he
must
have
been
with
the
llywarch
and
as
he
quite
possibly
was
with
the
oisin
instance
should
cast
his
version
of
the
arthurian
stories
in
a
similar
form
and
that
the
facts
noted
by
you
and
singer
may
be
thus
explained
now
that
both
professor
singer
who
has
an
exceptionally
wide
knowledge
of
medieval
literature
and
the
late
mr
alfred
nutt
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
does
not
need
to
be
emphasized
and
the
fact
that
two
such
competent
authorities
should
agree
upon
a
possible
solution
of
a
puzzling
literary
problem
makes
that
solution
worthy
of
careful
consideration
it
would
certainly
have
the
merit
of
simplifying
the
question
and
deserves
to
be
placed
upon
record
but
while
it
would
of
course
be
far
more
satisfactory
could
one
definitely
place
and
label
the
man
to
whom
we
owe
the
original
conception
which
gave
birth
and
impetus
to
this
immortal
body
of
literature
yet
the
precise
identity
of
the
author
of
the
earliest
grail
romance
is
of
the
accident
rather
than
the
essence
of
our
problem
whether
bleheris
the
welshman
be
or
be
not
identical
with
bledri
ap
cadivor
interpreter
and
friend
of
the
norman
nobles
the
general
hypothesis
remains
unaffected
and
may
be
thus
summarized
the
grail
story
is
not
du
fond
en
comble
the
product
of
imagination
literary
or
popular
at
its
root
lies
the
record
more
or
less
distorted
of
an
ancient
ritual
having
for
its
ultimate
object
the
initiation
into
the
secret
of
the
sources
of
life
physical
and
spiritual
this
ritual
in
its
lower
exoteric
form
as
affecting
the
processes
of
nature
and
physical
life
survives
and
can
be
traced
all
over
the
world
in
folk
ceremonies
which
however
widely
separated
the
countries
in
which
they
are
found
show
a
surprising
identity
of
detail
and
intention
in
its
esoteric
form
it
was
freely
utilized
for
the
imparting
of
high
spiritual
teaching
concerning
the
relation
of
man
to
the
divine
source
of
his
being
and
the
possibility
of
a
sensible
union
between
man
and
god
the
recognition
of
the
cosmic
activities
of
the
logos
appears
to
have
been
a
characteristic
feature
of
this
teaching
and
when
christianity
came
upon
the
scene
it
did
not
hesitate
to
utilize
the
already
existing
medium
of
instruction
but
boldly
identified
the
deity
of
vegetation
regarded
as
life
principle
with
the
god
of
the
christian
faith
thus
to
certain
of
the
early
christians
attis
was
but
an
earlier
manifestation
of
the
logos
whom
they
held
identical
with
christ
the
evidence
of
the
naassene
document
places
this
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
and
is
of
inestimable
value
as
establishing
a
link
between
and
christian
mystery
tradition
this
curious
synthetic
belief
united
as
it
was
with
the
highly
popular
cult
of
mithra
travelled
with
the
foreign
legionaries
adherents
of
that
cult
to
the
furthest
bounds
of
the
roman
empire
and
when
the
struggle
between
mithraism
and
christianity
ended
in
the
definite
triumph
of
the
latter
by
virtue
of
that
dual
synthetic
nature
the
higher
ritual
still
survived
and
was
celebrated
in
sites
removed
from
the
centres
of
population
in
caves
and
mountain
fastnesses
in
islands
and
on
desolate
the
earliest
version
of
the
grail
story
represented
by
our
bleheris
form
relates
the
visit
of
a
wandering
knight
to
one
of
these
hidden
temples
his
successful
passing
of
the
test
into
the
lower
grade
of
life
initiation
his
failure
to
attain
to
the
highest
degree
it
matters
little
whether
it
were
the
record
of
an
actual
or
of
a
possible
experience
the
casting
into
romantic
form
of
an
event
which
the
knew
to
have
happened
had
perchance
actually
witnessed
or
the
objective
recital
of
what
he
knew
might
have
occurred
the
essential
fact
is
that
the
of
the
story
the
nomenclature
the
march
of
incident
the
character
of
the
tests
correspond
to
what
we
know
from
independent
sources
of
the
details
of
this
nature
ritual
the
grail
quest
was
actually
possible
then
it
is
actually
possible
for
the
indication
of
two
of
our
romances
as
to
the
final
location
of
the
grail
is
not
imagination
but
the
record
of
actual
fact
as
first
told
the
story
preserved
its
primal
character
of
a
composite
between
christianity
and
the
nature
ritual
as
witnessed
by
the
ceremony
over
the
bier
of
the
dead
knight
the
procession
with
cross
and
incense
and
the
solemn
vespers
for
the
dead
this
i
suspect
correctly
represents
the
final
stage
of
the
process
by
which
was
identified
with
christ
thus
in
its
first
form
the
story
was
the
product
of
conscious
intention
but
when
the
tale
was
once
fairly
launched
as
a
romantic
tale
and
came
into
the
hands
of
those
unfamiliar
with
its
ritual
origin
though
the
fact
that
it
had
such
an
origin
was
probably
well
understood
the
influence
of
the
period
came
into
play
the
crusades
and
the
consequent
traffic
in
relics
especially
in
relics
of
the
passion
caused
the
identification
of
the
sex
symbols
lance
and
cup
with
the
weapon
of
the
crucifixion
and
the
cup
of
the
last
supper
but
the
christianization
was
merely
external
the
tale
as
a
whole
retaining
its
character
the
conversion
into
a
definitely
christian
romance
seems
to
have
been
due
to
two
causes
first
the
rivalry
between
the
two
great
monastic
houses
of
glastonbury
and
fescamp
the
latter
of
which
was
already
in
possession
of
a
genuine
relic
and
fully
developed
tradition
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
the
initial
combination
of
the
grail
and
traditions
took
place
at
fescamp
and
was
the
work
of
some
member
of
the
minstrel
guild
attached
to
that
abbey
but
the
grail
tradition
was
originally
british
glastonbury
was
from
time
immemorial
a
british
sanctuary
it
was
the
reputed
burial
place
of
arthur
of
whose
court
the
grail
quest
was
the
crowning
adventure
the
story
must
be
identified
with
british
soil
consequently
a
version
was
composed
now
represented
by
our
perlesvaus
text
in
which
the
union
of
nicodemus
of
fescamp
and
joseph
of
glastonbury
fame
as
ancestors
of
the
grail
hero
offers
a
significant
hint
of
the
provenance
of
the
version
secondly
a
no
less
important
element
in
the
process
was
due
to
the
conscious
action
of
robert
de
borron
who
well
understood
the
character
of
his
material
and
radically
remodelled
the
whole
on
the
basis
of
the
triple
mystery
tradition
translated
into
terms
of
high
christian
mysticism
a
notable
feature
of
borron
version
is
his
utilization
of
the
tradition
of
the
final
messianic
feast
in
combination
with
his
eucharistic
symbolism
a
combination
thoroughly
familiar
to
early
christian
mystics
once
started
on
a
definitely
romantic
career
the
grail
story
rapidly
became
a
complex
of
originally
divergent
themes
the
most
important
stage
in
its
development
being
the
incorporation
of
the
popular
tale
of
the
widow
son
brought
up
in
the
wilderness
and
launched
into
the
world
in
a
condition
of
absolute
ignorance
of
men
and
manners
the
perceval
story
is
a
charming
story
but
it
has
originally
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
grail
the
original
tale
now
best
represented
by
our
english
syr
percyvelle
of
galles
has
no
trace
of
mystery
element
it
is
pure
and
simple
i
believe
the
connection
with
the
grail
legend
to
be
purely
fortuitous
and
due
to
the
fact
that
the
hero
of
the
was
known
as
son
which
he
actually
was
while
this
title
represented
in
mystery
terminology
a
certain
grade
of
initiation
and
as
such
is
preserved
in
masonic
ritual
finally
the
rising
tide
of
dogmatic
medievalism
with
its
crassly
materialistic
view
of
the
eucharist
its
insistence
on
the
saving
grace
of
asceticism
and
celibacy
and
its
scarcely
veiled
contempt
for
women
overwhelmed
the
original
conception
certain
of
the
features
of
the
ancient
ritual
indeed
survive
but
they
are
factors
of
confusion
rather
than
clues
to
enlightenment
thus
while
the
grail
still
retains
its
character
of
a
feeding
vessel
comes
and
goes
without
visible
agency
and
supplies
each
knight
with
food
and
drink
as
he
best
loved
in
the
world
it
is
none
the
less
the
chalice
of
the
sacred
blood
and
critics
are
sorely
put
to
it
to
harmonize
these
conflicting
aspects
in
the
same
way
galahad
grandfather
still
bears
the
title
of
the
rich
fisher
and
there
are
confused
references
to
a
land
laid
waste
as
the
result
of
a
dolorous
stroke
but
while
the
terminology
lingers
on
to
our
perplexity
the
characters
involved
lie
outside
the
march
of
the
story
practically
no
trace
of
the
old
nature
ritual
survives
in
the
final
queste
form
the
remodelling
is
so
radical
that
it
seems
most
reasonable
to
conclude
that
it
was
purposeful
that
the
original
author
of
the
queste
had
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
real
nature
of
the
grail
and
was
bent
upon
a
complete
restatement
in
terms
of
current
orthodoxy
i
advisedly
use
this
term
as
i
see
no
trace
in
the
queste
of
a
genuine
mystic
conception
such
as
that
of
borron
so
far
as
criticism
of
the
literature
is
concerned
i
adhere
to
my
previously
expressed
opinion
that
the
queste
should
be
treated
rather
as
a
lancelot
than
as
a
grail
romance
it
is
of
real
importance
in
the
evolution
of
the
arthurian
romantic
cycle
as
a
factor
in
determining
the
true
character
and
origins
of
the
grail
legend
it
is
worse
than
useless
what
remains
of
the
original
features
is
so
fragmentary
and
so
distorted
that
any
attempt
to
use
the
version
as
basis
for
argument
or
comparison
can
only
introduce
a
further
element
of
confusion
into
an
already
more
than
sufficiently
involved
problem
i
am
also
still
of
opinion
that
the
table
of
descent
given
on
of
volume
ii
of
my
perceval
studies
represents
the
most
probable
evolution
of
the
literature
at
the
same
time
in
the
light
of
further
research
i
should
feel
inclined
to
add
the
grail
section
of
sone
de
nansai
as
deriving
from
the
same
source
which
gave
us
kiot
poem
and
the
perlesvaus
as
evidence
for
a
french
original
combining
important
features
of
these
two
versions
and
at
the
same
time
retaining
unmistakably
archaic
elements
which
have
disappeared
from
both
i
hold
this
section
of
the
poem
to
be
of
extreme
value
for
the
criticism
of
the
cycle
while
there
are
still
missing
links
in
the
chain
of
descent
versions
to
be
reconstructed
writers
to
be
identified
i
believe
that
in
its
ensemble
the
theory
set
forth
in
these
pages
will
be
found
to
be
the
only
one
which
will
satisfactorily
meet
all
the
conditions
of
the
problem
which
will
cover
the
whole
ground
of
investigation
omitting
no
element
evading
no
difficulty
which
will
harmonize
apparently
hopeless
contradictions
explain
apparently
meaningless
terminology
and
thus
provide
a
secure
foundation
for
the
criticism
of
a
body
of
literature
as
important
as
it
is
fascinating
the
study
and
the
criticism
of
the
grail
literature
will
possess
an
even
deeper
interest
a
more
absorbing
fascination
when
it
is
definitely
recognized
that
we
possess
in
that
literature
a
unique
example
of
the
restatement
of
an
ancient
and
august
ritual
in
terms
of
imperishable
romance

to
the
conclusion
that
tammuz
and

are
different
gods
owing
their
origin
to
a
common
parent
deity
where
the
original
conception
arose
is
doubtful
whether
in
babylon
in
canaan
or
in
a
land
where
the
common
ancestors
of
phoenicians
and
babylonian
semites
formed
an
original
unit
cf
tammuz
and
ishtar
langdon
it
may
be
well
to
note
here
the
the
deity
has
no
proper
name
he
is
only
known
by
an
appellative
damu
son
or
and
consort
is
only
a
general
epithet
which
designates
the
dying
god
in
a
theological
aspect
just
as
the
name
adoni
lord
certainly
replaced
a
more
specific
name
for
the
god
of
byblos
esmun
of
sidon
another
type
of
adonis
is
a
title
only
and
means
simply
name
cf

remarks
on
the
evolution
of
the
tammuz
cult
should
be
carefully
studied
in
view
of
the
theory
maintained
by
sir
ridgeway
that
the
vegetation
deities
were
all
of
them
originally
men
from
a
liturgy
employed
at
nippur
in
the
period
of

what
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
of
the
religion
points
to
it
rather
as
a
religion
of
mourning
and
supplication
than
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
the
people
seem
to
have
been
in
perpetual
dread
of
their
gods
who
require
to
be
appeased
by
continual
acts
of
humiliation

the
and
of
the

were

days

these
remarks
apply
also
to
the
kindred
cult
of
attis
which
as
we
shall
see
later
forms
an
important
link
in
our
chain
of
evidence
the
two
cults
are
practically
identical
and
scholars
are
frequently
at
a
loss
to
which
group
surviving
fragments
of
the
ritual
should
be
assigned
in
this
connection
note
the
extremely
instructive
remarks
of
miss
harrison
in
the
chapter
on
herakles
in
the
work
referred
to
above
she
points
out
that
the
eniautos
daimon
never
becomes
entirely
and
olympian
but
always
retains
traces
of
his
origin
this
principle
is
particularly
well
illustrated
by
adonis
who
though
admitted
to
olympus
as
the
lover
of
aphrodite
is
yet
by
this
very
nature
forced
to
return
to
the
earth
and
descend
to
the
realm
of
persephone
this
agrees
well
with
the
conclusion
reached
by
baudissin
adonis
und
esmun
that
adonis
belongs
to
einer
klasse
von
wesen
sehr
unbestimmter
art
die
wohl

if
baudissin
is
correct
and
the
introduction
of
the
boar
a
later
addition
to
the
story
it
would
seem
to
indicate
the
intrusion
of
a
phallic
element
into
ritual
which
at
first
like
that
of
tammuz
dealt
merely
with
the
death
of
the
god
the
attis
form
on
the
contrary
appears
to
have
been
phallic
from
the
first

to

much
of
the
uncertainty
as
to
date
is
doubtless
due
to
the
reflective
influence
of
other

the
cult
the
tammuz
celebrations
were
held
from
june
to
july
when
the
sirius
was
in
the
ascendant
and
vegetation
failed
beneath
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
in
other
and
more
temperate
climates
the
date
would
fall
later
where
however
the
cult
was
an
of
a
tammuz
original
as
might
be
the
case
through
emigration
the
tendency
would
be
to
retain
the

my

on
this
point
was
a

who
gave
me
the
facts
within

personal
knowledge
i
referred
the
question
to
prof
basil
hall
chamberlain
who
wrote
in
answer
that
he
had
not
himself
met
with
the
practice
but
that
the
samurai
ceremonies
differed
in
different
provinces
and
my
informant
might
well
be
correct
this
explanation
has
at
least
the
merit
of
simplicity
as
compared
with
that
proposed
by
the
author
of
the
legend
of
longinus
pp
et
which
would
connect
the
feature
with
an
obscure
heretical
practice
of
the
early
irish
church
it
would
also
meet
professor

very
reasonable
objections

others
have
pointed

the

on
the
point
that
chrétien
was
treating
an
already
popular
theme
cf

that
is
the
relationship
is

a
critic
of
my
quest
volume
remarks
that
we
have
as
little
faith
in
wauchier
appeal
to
a
welshman
bleheris
as
source
for
his
continuation
of
chrétien
as
we
have
in
layamon
similar
appeal
to
bede
and
st
austin
at
the
beginning
of
the
the
remark
seems
to
me
singularly
inept
there
is
no
parallel
between
the
cases
in
the
first
place
layamon
does
not
refer
to
bede
and
st
austin
as
source
but
as
models
a
very
different
thing
then
the
statement
is
discredited
by
the
fact
that
we
possess
the
writings
of
these
men
and
know
them
to
be
of
another
character
than
metrical
chronicles
in
the
case
of
wauchier
his
reference
does
not
stand
alone
it
is
one
of
a
group
and
that
group
marked
by
an
extraordinary
unanimity
of
statement
whoever
bleheris
may
have
been
he
was
certainly
possessed
of
two
definite
qualifications
he
knew
a
vast
number
of
tales
and
he
possessed
a
remarkable
gift
of
narration
he
was
a
par
excellence
thus
he
was
a
priori
a
probable
source
for
that
section
of
wauchier
work
which
is
attributed
to
him
a
section
consisting
of
short
picturesque
and
mutually
independent
tales
which
formed
part
of
a
popular
collection
it
is
misleading
to
speak
as
if
wauchier
refers
to
him
as
general
source
for
his
perceval
continuation
the
references
are
clearly
marked
and
refer
to
gawain
tales
apart
from
the
fact
that
wauchier
reference
does
not
stand
alone
we
have
independent
evidence
of
the
actual
existence
of
such
a
group
of
tales
in
our
surviving
gawain
poems
certain
of
which
such
as
kay
and
the
spit
and
golagros
and
gawayne
are
versions
of
the
stories
given
by
wauchier
while
the
author
of
the
elucidation
was
also
familiar
with
the
same
collection
if
evidence
for
the
identity
of
bleheris
is
incomplete
that
for
his
existence
appears
to
be
incontrovertible
would
it
not
be
more
honest
if
such
a
critic
as
the
writer
referred
to
said
do
not
choose
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
bleheris
because
it
runs
counter
to
my
theory
of
the
evolution
of
the
literature
we
should
then
know
where
we
are
such
a
parallel
as
that
cited
above
has
no
value
for
those
familiar
with
the
literature
but
may
easily
mislead
the
general
reader
i
would
also
draw
attention
to
the
fact
noted
in
the
text
the
extreme
improbability
of
wauchier
a
continental
writer
inventing
an
insular
and
welsh
source
this
is
a
point
critics
carefully
evade
cf

lot
remarks
that
he
has
not
met
with
the
name
in

it
thus
appears
to
be
insular

note
on
the
identification
of
bleheris
ed
vol
ii
cf
also
revue
celtique
in
the
course
of
i
received
letters
from
mr
rogers
rees
resident
at
stepaside
pembrokeshire
who
informed
me
that
he
held
definite
proof
of
the
connection
of
bledri
with
both
grail
and
perceval
legends
the
locality
had
been
part
of
bledri
estate
and
the
house
in
which
he
lived
was
built
on
the
site
of
what
had
been
bledri
castle
mr
rogers
rees
maintained
the
existence
of
a
living
tradition
connecting
bledri
with
the
legends
in
question
at
his
request
i
sent
him
the
list
of
the
names
of
the
brothers
of
alain
li
gros
as
given
in
the
edition
of
the
perlesvaus
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
bibliothčque
nationale
and
received
in
return
a
letter
stating
that
the
list
must
have
been
compiled
by
one
familiar
with
the
district
unfortunately
for
a
year
from
the
autumn
of
i
was
debarred
from
work
and
when
on
resuming
my
studies
i
wrote
to
my
correspondent
asking
for
the
promised
evidence
i
obtained
no
answer
to
my
repeated
appeal
on
communicating
with
mr
owen
i
found
he
had
had
precisely
the
same
experience
and
for
his
part
was
extremely
sceptical
as
to
there
being
any
genuine
foundation
for
our
correspondent
assertions
while
it
is
thus
impossible
to
use
the
statements
in
question
as
elements
in
my
argument
i
think
it
right
in
the
interests
of
scholarship
to
place
them
on
record
they
may
afford
a
clue
which
some
welsh
scholar
may
be
able
to
follow
up
to
a
more
satisfactory
conclusion
had
wauchier
really
desired
to
invent
an
authority
in
view
of
his
date
and
connection
with
the
house
of
flanders
he
had
a
famous
name
at
hand
that
of
chrétien
de
troyes
cf
legend
of
sir
perceval
vol
ii
and
note
i
have
recently
received
dr
brugger
review
of
mr
griffith
study
of
the
english
poem
and
am
glad
to
see
that
the
critic
accepts
the
independence
of
this
version
if
scholars
can
see
their
way
to
accept
as
faits
acquis
the
mutual
independence
of
the
grail
and
perceval
themes
we
shall
at
last
have
a
solid
basis
for
future
criticism
