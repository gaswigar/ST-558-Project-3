two
little
confederates
chapter
i
the
two
little
confederates
lived
at
oakland
it
was
not
a
handsome
place
as
modern
ideas
go
but
down
in
old
virginia
where
the
standard
was
different
from
the
later
one
it
passed
in
old
times
as
one
of
the
best
plantations
in
all
that
region
the
boys
thought
it
the
greatest
place
in
the
world
of
course
excepting
richmond
where
they
had
been
one
year
to
the
fair
and
had
seen
a
man
pull
fire
out
of
his
mouth
and
do
other
wonderful
things
it
was
quite
secluded
it
lay
it
is
true
right
between
two
of
the
county
roads
the
road
being
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
great
mountain
road
down
which
the
large
covered
wagons
with
six
horses
and
jingling
bells
used
to
go
but
the
lodge
lay
this
side
of
the
one
and
the
big
woods
where
the
boys
shot
squirrels
and
hunted
and
coons
and
which
reached
to
the
edge
of
holetown
stretched
between
the
house
and
the
other
so
that
the
big
where
the
mail
was
left
by
the
each
tuesday
and
friday
afternoon
was
a
long
walk
even
by
the
near
cut
through
the
woods
the
railroad
was
ten
miles
away
by
the
road
there
was
a
nearer
way
only
about
half
the
distance
by
which
the
negroes
used
to
walk
and
which
during
the
war
after
all
the
horses
were
gone
the
boys
too
learned
to
travel
but
before
that
the
road
by
trinity
church
and
honeyman
bridge
was
the
only
route
and
the
other
was
simply
a
dim
and
the
was
known
to
the
initiated
alone
the
mansion
itself
was
known
on
the
plantation
as
the
to
distinguish
it
from
all
the
other
houses
on
the
place
of
which
there
were
many
it
had
as
many
wings
as
the
angels
in
the
vision
of
ezekiel
these
additions
had
been
made
some
in
one
generation
some
in
another
as
the
size
of
the
family
required
and
finally
when
there
was
no
side
of
the
original
structure
to
which
another
wing
could
be
joined
a
separate
building
had
been
erected
on
the
edge
of
the
yard
which
was
called
the
office
and
was
used
as
such
as
well
as
for
a
by
the
young
men
of
the
family
the
privilege
of
sleeping
in
the
office
was
highly
esteemed
for
like
the
it
marked
the
entrance
upon
manhood
of
the
youths
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
enjoy
it
there
smoking
was
admissible
there
the
guns
were
kept
in
the
corner
and
there
the
dogs
were
allowed
to
sleep
at
the
feet
of
their
young
masters
or
in
bed
with
them
if
they
preferred
it
in
one
of
the
rooms
in
this
building
the
boys
went
to
school
whilst
small
and
another
they
looked
forward
to
having
as
their
own
when
they
should
be
old
enough
to
be
elevated
to
the
coveted
dignity
of
sleeping
in
the
office
hugh
already
slept
there
and
gave
himself
airs
in
proportion
but
hugh
they
regarded
as
a
very
aged
person
not
as
old
it
was
true
as
their
cousins
who
came
down
from
college
at
christmas
and
who
at
the
first
outbreak
of
war
all
rushed
into
the
army
but
each
of
these
was
in
the
boys
eyes
a
methuselah
hugh
had
his
own
horse
and
the
gun
and
when
a
fellow
got
those
there
was
little
material
difference
between
him
and
other
men
even
if
he
did
have
to
go
to
the
academy
which
was
really
something
like
going
to
school
the
boys
were
frank
and
willy
frank
being
the
eldest
they
went
by
several
names
on
the
place
their
mother
called
them
her
little
men
with
much
pride
uncle
balla
spoke
of
them
as
them
chillern
which
generally
implied
something
of
reproach
and
lucy
ann
who
had
been
taken
into
the
house
to
run
after
them
when
they
were
little
boys
always
coupled
their
names
as
frank
willy
peter
and
cole
did
the
same
when
their
mistress
was
not
by
when
there
first
began
to
be
talk
at
oakland
about
the
war
the
boys
thought
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
their
principal
ideas
about
war
being
formed
from
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
bible
and
its
accounts
of
the
wars
of
the
children
of
israel
in
which
men
women
and
children
were
invariably
put
to
the
sword
this
gave
a
vivid
conception
of
its
horrors
one
evening
in
the
midst
of
a
discussion
about
the
approaching
crisis
willy
astonished
the
company
who
were
discussing
the
merits
of
probable
leaders
of
the
union
armies
by
suddenly
announcing
that
he
bet
they
did
have
any
general
who
could
beat
joab
up
to
the
time
of
the
war
the
boys
had
led
a
very
uneventful
but
a
very
pleasant
life
they
used
to
go
hunting
with
hugh
their
older
brother
when
he
would
let
them
go
and
after
the
cows
with
peter
and
cole
old
balla
the
driver
was
their
boon
comrade
and
adviser
and
taught
them
to
make
whips
and
traps
for
hares
and
birds
as
he
had
taught
them
to
ride
and
to
cobble
shoes
he
lived
alone
for
his
wife
had
been
set
free
years
before
and
lived
in
philadelphia
his
room
over
the
old
kitchen
was
the
when
he
would
permit
them
to
come
in
there
were
so
many
odds
and
ends
in
it
that
it
was
a
delightful
place
then
the
boys
played
in
the
house
or
about
the
yard
or
garden
or
upstairs
in
their
den
a
narrow
alcove
at
the
top
of
the
house
the
little
creek
that
ran
through
the
meadow
behind
the
barn
was
one
of
their
haunts
they
fished
in
it
for
minnows
and
little
perch
they
made
dams
and
bathed
in
it
and
sometimes
they
played
pirates
upon
its
waters
once
they
made
an
extended
search
up
and
down
its
banks
for
any
fragments
of
pharaoh
chariots
which
might
have
been
washed
up
so
high
but
that
was
when
they
were
younger
and
did
not
have
much
sense
chapter
ii
there
was
great
excitement
at
oakland
during
the
john
brown
raid
and
the
boys
grandmother
used
to
pray
for
him
and
cook
whose
pictures
were
in
the
papers
the
boys
became
soldiers
and
drilled
punctiliously
with
guns
which
they
got
uncle
balla
to
make
for
them
frank
was
the
captain
willy
the
first
lieutenant
and
a
dozen
or
more
little
negroes
composed
the
rank
and
file
peter
and
cole
being
trusted
a
little
later
they
found
their
sympathies
all
on
the
side
of
peace
and
the
preservation
of
the
union
their
uncle
was
for
keeping
the
union
unbroken
and
ran
for
the
convention
against
colonel
richards
who
was
the
chief
officer
of
the
militia
in
the
county
and
was
as
as
tamerlane
who
reared
the
pyramid
of
skulls
and
as
hungry
for
military
renown
as
the
great
napoleon
about
whom
the
boys
had
read
there
was
immense
excitement
in
the
county
over
the
election
though
the
boys
mother
had
made
them
add
to
their
prayers
a
petition
that
their
uncle
william
might
win
and
that
he
might
secure
the
blessings
of
peace
and
though
at
family
prayers
night
and
morning
the
same
petition
was
presented
the
boys
uncle
was
beaten
at
the
polls
by
a
large
majority
and
then
they
knew
there
was
bound
to
be
war
and
that
it
must
be
very
wicked
they
almost
felt
the
heel
and
the
invaders
were
invariably
spoken
of
as
cruel
and
the
heel
was
described
as
of
iron
and
was
always
mentioned
as
engaged
in
the
act
of
crushing
they
would
have
been
terribly
alarmed
at
this
cruel
invasion
had
they
not
been
reassured
by
the
general
belief
of
the
community
that
one
southerner
could
whip
ten
yankees
and
that
collectively
the
south
could
drive
back
the
north
with
when
the
war
actually
broke
out
the
boys
were
the
most
enthusiastic
of
rebels
and
the
troops
in
camp
lee
did
not
drill
more
continuously
nor
industriously
their
father
who
had
been
a
whig
and
opposed
secession
until
the
very
last
on
virginia
seceding
finally
cast
his
lot
with
his
people
and
joined
an
infantry
company
and
uncle
william
raised
and
equipped
an
artillery
company
of
which
he
was
chosen
captain
but
the
infantry
was
too
tame
and
the
artillery
too
ponderous
to
suit
the
boys
they
were
taken
to
see
the
drill
of
the
county
troop
of
cavalry
with
its
prancing
horses
and
clanging
sabres
it
was
commanded
by
a
cousin
and
from
that
moment
they
were
cavalrymen
to
the
core
they
flung
away
their
in
disgust
and
uncle
balla
spent
two
grumbling
days
fashioning
them
a
stableful
of
horses
with
real
heads
and
sure
leather
bridles
once
indeed
a
secret
attempt
was
made
to
utilize
the
horses
and
mules
which
were
running
in
the
back
pasture
but
a
premature
discovery
of
the
matter
ended
in
such
disaster
to
all
concerned
that
the
plan
was
abandoned
and
the
boys
had
to
content
themselves
with
their
wooden
steeds
the
day
that
the
final
orders
came
for
their
father
and
uncle
to
go
to
richmond
from
which
point
they
were
ordered
to
the
peninsula
the
boys
could
not
understand
why
every
one
was
suddenly
plunged
into
such
distress
then
next
morning
when
the
soldiers
left
the
boys
could
not
altogether
comprehend
it
they
thought
it
was
a
very
fine
thing
to
be
allowed
to
ride
frank
and
hun
the
two
with
their
new
deep
army
saddles
and
long
bits
they
cried
when
their
father
and
uncle
said
and
went
away
but
it
was
because
their
mother
looked
so
pale
and
ill
and
not
because
they
did
not
think
it
was
all
grand
they
had
no
doubt
that
all
would
come
back
soon
for
old
uncle
billy
the
who
had
been
born
down
in
little
york
where
cornwallis
surrendered
had
expressed
the
sentiment
of
the
whole
plantation
when
he
declared
as
he
sat
in
the
back
yard
surrounded
by
an
admiring
throng
and
surveyed
the
two
glittering
sabres
which
he
had
no
one
but
himself
to
polish
that
ef
them
britishers
jest
sees
dese
swodes
dee
run
the
boys
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
these
were
not
british
but
yankees
but
he
was
hard
to
convince
even
lucy
ann
who
was
incurably
afraid
of
everything
like
a
gun
or
partook
of
the
general
fervor
and
boasted
effusively
that
she
had
actually
tetched
marse
john
big
pistils
hugh
who
was
fifteen
and
was
permitted
to
accompany
his
father
to
richmond
was
regarded
by
the
boys
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
envy
and
veneration
which
he
accepted
with
dignified
complacency
frank
and
willy
soon
found
that
war
brought
some
immunities
the
house
filled
up
so
with
the
families
of
cousins
and
friends
who
were
refugees
that
the
boys
were
obliged
to
sleep
in
the
office
and
thus
they
felt
that
at
a
bound
they
were
almost
as
old
as
hugh
there
were
the
cousins
from
gloucester
from
the
valley
and
families
of
relatives
from
baltimore
and
new
york
who
had
come
south
on
the
declaration
of
war
their
favorite
was
their
cousin
belle
whose
beauty
at
once
captivated
both
boys
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
boys
knew
anything
of
girls
except
their
own
sister
evelyn
and
after
a
brief
period
during
which
the
novelty
gave
them
pleasure
the
inability
of
the
girls
to
hunt
climb
trees
or
play
knucks
and
the
additional
restraint
which
their
presence
imposed
caused
them
to
hold
the
opinion
that
girls
were
no
good
chapter
iii
in
course
of
time
they
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
army
which
meant
the
confederates
the
idea
that
the
yankees
could
ever
get
to
oakland
never
entered
any
one
head
it
was
understood
that
the
army
lay
between
oakland
and
them
and
surely
they
could
never
get
by
the
innumerable
soldiers
who
were
always
passing
up
one
road
or
the
other
and
who
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
were
coming
to
be
fed
and
were
rapidly
eating
up
everything
that
had
been
left
on
the
place
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
they
had
been
coming
so
long
that
they
made
scarcely
any
difference
but
the
first
time
a
regiment
camped
in
the
neighborhood
it
created
great
excitement
it
became
known
one
night
that
a
cavalry
regiment
in
which
were
several
of
their
cousins
was
encamped
at
honeyman
bridge
and
the
boys
mother
determined
to
send
a
supply
of
provisions
for
the
camp
next
morning
so
several
sheep
were
killed
the
was
opened
and
all
night
long
the
great
fires
in
the
kitchen
and
glowed
and
even
then
there
was
not
room
so
that
a
big
fire
was
kindled
in
the
back
yard
beside
which
saddles
of
mutton
were
roasted
in
the
tin
kitchens
everybody
was
rushing
the
boys
were
told
that
they
might
go
to
see
the
soldiers
and
as
they
had
to
get
off
long
before
daylight
they
went
to
bed
early
and
left
all
the
other
boys
that
is
peter
and
cole
and
other
colored
children
squatting
about
the
fires
and
trying
to
help
the
cooks
to
pile
on
wood
it
was
hard
to
leave
the
exciting
scene
they
were
very
sleepy
the
next
morning
indeed
they
seemed
scarcely
to
have
fallen
asleep
when
lucy
ann
shook
them
but
they
jumped
up
without
the
usual
application
of
cold
water
in
their
faces
which
lucy
ann
so
delighted
to
make
and
in
a
little
while
they
were
out
in
the
yard
where
balla
was
standing
holding
three
horses
their
another
with
a
for
their
cousin
belle
whose
brother
was
in
the
regiment
and
one
for
himself
and
peter
and
cole
were
holding
the
for
the
boys
and
several
other
men
were
holding
mules
great
hampers
covered
with
white
napkins
were
on
the
porch
and
the
savory
smell
decided
the
boys
not
to
eat
their
breakfast
but
to
wait
and
take
their
share
with
the
soldiers
the
roads
were
so
bad
that
the
carriage
could
not
go
and
as
the
mother
wished
to
get
the
provisions
to
the
soldiers
before
they
broke
camp
they
had
to
set
out
at
once
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
all
in
the
saddle
the
boys
and
their
mother
and
cousin
belle
in
front
and
balla
and
the
other
servants
following
close
behind
each
holding
before
him
a
hamper
which
looked
queer
and
shadowy
as
they
rode
on
in
the
darkness
the
sky
which
was
filled
with
stars
when
they
set
out
grew
white
as
they
splashed
along
mile
after
mile
through
the
mud
then
the
road
became
clearer
they
could
see
into
the
woods
and
the
sky
changed
to
a
rich
pink
like
the
color
of
their
horses
were
covered
with
mud
up
to
the
they
turned
into
a
lane
only
half
a
mile
from
the
bridge
and
suddenly
a
bugle
rang
out
down
in
the
wooded
bottom
below
them
and
the
boys
hardly
could
be
kept
from
putting
their
horses
to
a
run
so
fearful
were
they
that
the
soldiers
were
leaving
and
that
they
should
not
see
them
their
mother
however
told
them
that
this
was
probably
the
reveille
or
of
the
soldiers
she
rode
on
at
a
good
sharp
canter
and
the
boys
were
diverting
themselves
over
a
discussion
as
to
who
would
act
the
part
of
lucy
ann
in
waking
the
regiment
of
soldiers
when
they
turned
a
curve
and
at
the
end
of
the
road
a
few
hundred
yards
ahead
stood
several
horsemen
there
they
are
exclaimed
both
boys
no
that
is
a
picket
said
their
mother
gallop
on
frank
and
tell
them
we
are
bringing
breakfast
for
the
regiment
frank
dashed
ahead
and
soon
they
saw
a
soldier
ride
forward
to
meet
him
and
after
a
few
words
return
with
him
to
his
comrades
then
while
they
were
still
a
hundred
yards
distant
they
saw
frank
who
had
received
some
directions
start
off
again
toward
the
bridge
at
a
hard
gallop
the
picket
had
told
him
to
go
straight
on
down
the
hill
and
he
would
find
the
camp
just
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
he
accordingly
rode
on
feeling
very
important
at
being
allowed
to
go
alone
to
the
camp
on
such
a
mission
as
he
reached
a
turn
in
the
road
just
above
the
river
the
whole
regiment
lay
swarming
below
him
among
the
large
trees
on
the
bank
of
the
little
stream
the
horses
were
picketed
to
bushes
and
stakes
in
long
rows
the
saddles
lying
on
the
ground
not
far
off
and
hundreds
of
men
were
moving
about
some
in
full
uniform
and
others
without
coat
or
vest
a
wagons
with
sheets
on
them
stood
on
one
side
among
the
trees
near
which
several
fires
were
smoking
with
men
around
them
as
frank
clattered
up
to
the
bridge
a
soldier
with
a
gun
on
his
arm
who
had
been
standing
by
the
railing
walked
out
to
the
middle
of
the
bridge
halt
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
my
young
man
he
said
i
wish
to
see
the
colonel
said
frank
repeating
as
nearly
as
he
could
the
words
the
picket
had
told
him
what
do
you
want
with
him
frank
was
tempted
not
to
tell
him
but
he
was
so
impatient
to
deliver
his
message
before
the
others
should
arrive
that
he
told
him
what
he
had
come
for
there
he
is
said
the
sentinel
pointing
to
a
place
among
the
trees
where
stood
at
least
five
hundred
men
frank
looked
expecting
to
recognize
the
colonel
by
his
noble
bearing
or
splendid
uniform
or
some
striking
marks
where
he
asked
in
doubt
for
while
a
number
of
the
men
were
in
uniform
he
knew
these
to
be
privates
there
said
the
sentry
pointing
by
that
stump
near
the
yellow
frank
looked
again
the
only
man
he
could
fix
upon
by
the
description
was
a
young
fellow
washing
his
face
in
a
tin
basin
and
he
felt
that
this
could
not
be
the
colonel
but
he
did
not
like
to
appear
dull
so
he
thanked
the
man
and
rode
on
thinking
he
would
go
to
the
point
indicated
and
ask
some
one
else
to
show
him
the
officer
he
felt
quite
grand
as
he
rode
in
among
the
men
who
he
thought
would
recognize
his
importance
and
treat
him
accordingly
but
as
he
passed
on
instead
of
paying
him
the
respect
he
had
expected
they
began
to
guy
him
with
all
sorts
of
questions
hullo
bud
going
to
jine
the
cavalry
asked
one
which
is
oldest
you
or
your
horse
inquired
another
how
pa
and
ma
does
your
mother
know
you
out
asked
others
one
soldier
walked
up
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
bridle
proceeded
affably
to
ask
him
after
his
health
and
that
of
every
member
of
his
family
at
first
frank
did
not
understand
that
they
were
making
fun
of
him
but
it
dawned
on
him
when
the
man
asked
him
solemnly
are
there
any
yankees
around
that
you
were
running
away
so
fast
just
now
no
if
there
were
i
never
have
found
here
said
frank
shortly
in
reply
which
at
once
turned
the
tide
in
his
favor
and
diverted
the
ridicule
from
himself
to
his
teaser
who
was
seized
by
some
of
his
comrades
and
carried
off
with
much
laughter
and
slapping
on
the
back
i
wish
to
see
colonel
marshall
said
frank
pushing
his
way
through
the
group
that
surrounded
him
and
riding
up
to
the
man
who
was
still
occupied
at
the
basin
on
the
stump
all
right
sir
i
the
man
said
the
individual
cheerily
looking
up
with
his
face
dripping
and
rosy
from
its
recent
scrubbing
you
the
colonel
exclaimed
frank
suspicious
that
he
was
again
being
ridiculed
and
thinking
it
impossible
that
this
slim
youngster
who
was
scarcely
stouter
than
hugh
and
who
was
washing
in
a
tin
basin
could
be
the
commander
of
all
these
men
many
of
whom
were
old
enough
to
be
his
father
yes
i
the
i
in
command
said
the
gentleman
smiling
at
him
over
the
towel
something
made
frank
understand
that
this
was
really
the
officer
and
he
gave
his
message
which
was
received
with
many
expressions
of
thanks
wo
you
get
down
here
campbell
take
this
horse
will
you
he
called
to
a
soldier
as
frank
sprang
from
his
horse
the
orderly
stepped
forward
and
took
the
bridle
now
come
with
me
said
the
colonel
leading
the
way
we
must
get
ready
to
receive
your
mother
there
are
some
ladies
coming
and
breakfast
he
called
to
a
group
who
were
engaged
in
the
same
occupation
he
had
just
ended
and
whom
frank
knew
by
instinct
to
be
officers
the
information
seemed
to
electrify
the
little
knot
addressed
for
they
began
to
rush
around
and
in
a
few
moments
they
all
were
in
their
uniforms
and
surrounding
the
colonel
who
having
brushed
his
hair
with
the
aid
of
a
little
glass
hung
on
a
bush
had
hurried
into
his
coat
and
was
buckling
on
his
sword
and
giving
orders
in
a
way
which
at
once
satisfied
frank
that
he
was
every
inch
a
colonel
now
let
us
go
and
receive
your
mother
said
he
to
the
boy
as
he
strode
through
the
camp
with
his
coat
tightly
buttoned
his
soft
hat
set
jauntily
on
the
side
of
his
head
his
plumes
sweeping
over
its
side
and
his
sword
clattering
at
his
spurred
heel
he
presented
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
which
he
had
made
a
little
before
with
his
head
in
a
tin
basin
and
his
face
covered
with
lather
in
fact
colonel
marshall
was
already
a
noted
officer
and
before
the
end
of
the
war
he
attained
still
higher
rank
and
reputation
the
colonel
met
the
rest
of
the
party
at
the
bridge
and
introduced
himself
and
several
officers
who
soon
joined
him
the
negroes
were
directed
to
take
the
provisions
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
stream
into
the
camp
and
in
a
little
while
the
whole
regiment
were
enjoying
the
breakfast
the
boys
and
their
mother
had
at
the
colonel
request
joined
his
mess
in
which
was
one
of
their
cousins
the
brother
of
their
cousin
belle
the
gentlemen
could
eat
scarcely
anything
they
were
so
busy
attending
to
the
wants
of
the
ladies
the
colonel
particularly
waited
on
their
cousin
belle
all
the
time
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
the
colonel
left
them
and
a
bugle
blew
in
a
minute
all
was
bustle
officers
were
giving
orders
horses
were
saddled
and
brought
out
and
by
what
seemed
magic
to
the
boys
the
men
who
just
before
were
scattered
about
among
the
trees
laughing
and
eating
were
standing
by
their
horses
all
in
proper
order
the
colonel
and
the
officers
came
and
said
again
the
bugle
blew
every
man
was
in
his
saddle
a
few
words
by
the
colonel
followed
by
other
words
from
the
captains
and
the
column
started
turning
across
the
bridge
the
feet
of
the
horses
thundering
on
the
planks
then
the
regiment
wound
up
the
hill
at
a
walk
the
men
singing
snatches
of
a
dozen
songs
of
which
the
bonnie
blue
flag
lorena
and
carry
me
back
to
old
virginia
shore
were
the
chief
ones
it
seemed
to
the
boys
that
to
be
a
soldier
was
the
noblest
thing
on
earth
and
that
this
regiment
could
do
anything
chapter
iv
after
this
it
became
a
common
thing
for
passing
regiments
to
camp
near
oakland
and
the
fire
blazed
many
a
night
cooking
for
the
soldiers
till
the
chickens
were
crowing
in
the
morning
the
negroes
all
had
and
raised
their
own
chickens
and
when
a
camp
was
near
them
they
used
to
drive
a
thriving
trade
on
their
own
account
selling
eggs
and
chickens
to
the
privates
while
the
officers
were
entertained
in
the
gret
house
it
was
thought
an
honor
to
furnish
food
to
the
soldiers
every
soldier
was
to
the
boys
a
hero
and
each
young
officer
might
rival
ivanhoe
or
coeur
de
lion
it
was
not
a
great
while
however
before
they
learned
that
all
soldiers
were
not
like
their
favorite
knights
at
any
rate
thefts
were
frequent
the
absence
of
men
from
the
plantations
and
the
constant
passing
of
strangers
made
stealing
easy
were
robbed
time
after
time
and
even
pigs
and
sheep
were
taken
without
any
trace
of
the
thieves
the
boys
however
which
was
in
the
yard
had
never
been
troubled
it
was
about
their
only
possession
and
they
took
great
pride
in
it
one
night
the
boys
were
fast
asleep
in
their
room
in
the
office
with
old
bruno
and
nick
curled
up
on
their
on
the
floor
hugh
was
away
so
the
boys
were
the
only
men
on
the
place
and
felt
that
they
were
the
protectors
of
the
plantation
the
frequent
thefts
had
made
every
one
very
suspicious
and
the
boys
had
made
up
their
minds
to
be
on
the
watch
and
if
possible
to
catch
the
thief
the
negroes
said
that
the
deserters
did
the
stealing
on
the
night
in
question
the
boys
were
sound
asleep
when
old
bruno
gave
a
low
growl
and
then
began
walking
and
sniffing
up
and
down
the
room
soon
nick
gave
a
sharp
quick
bark
frank
waked
first
he
was
not
startled
for
the
dogs
were
in
the
habit
of
barking
whenever
they
wished
to
go
now
however
they
kept
it
up
and
it
was
in
a
strain
somewhat
different
from
their
usual
signal
what
the
matter
with
you
go
and
lie
down
bruno
called
frank
hush
up
nick
but
bruno
would
not
lie
down
and
nick
would
not
keep
quiet
though
at
the
sound
of
frank
voice
they
felt
less
responsibility
and
contented
themselves
with
a
low
growling
after
a
little
while
frank
was
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
to
sleep
again
when
he
heard
a
sound
out
in
the
yard
which
at
once
thoroughly
awakened
him
he
nudged
willy
in
the
side
willy
willy
wake
up
there
some
one
moving
around
outdoors
groaned
willy
turning
over
and
settling
himself
for
another
nap
the
sound
of
a
chicken
chirping
out
in
fright
reached
frank
ear
wake
up
willy
he
called
pinching
him
hard
there
some
one
at
the
willy
was
awake
in
a
second
the
boys
consulted
as
to
what
should
be
done
willy
was
sceptical
he
thought
frank
had
been
dreaming
or
that
it
was
only
uncle
balla
or
some
one
moving
about
the
yard
but
a
second
cackle
of
warning
reached
them
and
in
a
minute
both
boys
were
out
of
bed
pulling
on
their
clothes
with
trembling
impatience
let
go
and
wake
uncle
balla
proposed
willy
getting
himself
all
tangled
in
the
legs
of
his
trousers
no
i
tell
you
what
let
catch
him
ourselves
suggested
frank
all
right
assented
willy
we
catch
him
and
lock
him
up
suppose
he
got
a
pistol
your
gun
maybe
wo
go
off
it
does
always
burst
the
cap
well
your
old
musket
is
loaded
and
you
can
hold
him
while
i
snap
the
cap
at
him
and
get
it
ready
all
right
i
ca
find
my
jacket
i
hold
him
where
in
the
world
is
my
hat
whispered
frank
never
mind
it
must
be
in
the
house
let
go
out
the
back
way
we
can
get
out
without
his
hearing
us
what
shall
we
do
with
the
dogs
let
shut
them
up
no
let
take
with
us
we
can
keep
them
quiet
and
hold
in
and
they
can
track
him
if
he
gets
away
all
right
and
the
boys
slowly
opened
the
door
and
crept
stealthily
out
frank
clutching
his
gun
and
willy
hugging
a
heavy
musket
which
he
had
found
and
claimed
as
one
of
the
prizes
of
war
it
was
almost
they
decided
that
one
should
take
one
side
of
the
and
one
the
other
side
in
such
a
way
that
if
they
had
to
shoot
they
would
almost
certainly
shoot
one
another
but
before
they
had
separated
both
dogs
jerked
loose
from
their
hands
and
dashed
away
in
the
darkness
barking
furiously
there
he
goes
round
the
garden
shouted
willy
as
the
sound
of
footsteps
like
those
of
a
man
running
with
all
his
might
came
from
the
direction
which
the
dogs
had
taken
come
on
and
both
started
but
after
taking
a
few
steps
they
stopped
to
listen
so
that
they
might
trace
the
fugitive
a
faint
noise
behind
them
arrested
their
attention
and
frank
tiptoed
back
toward
the
it
was
too
dark
to
see
much
but
he
heard
the
door
creak
and
was
conscious
even
in
the
darkness
that
it
was
being
pushed
slowly
open
here
one
willy
he
shouted
at
the
same
time
putting
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
pulling
the
trigger
the
hammer
fell
with
a
sharp
click
just
as
the
door
was
snatched
to
with
a
bang
the
cap
had
failed
to
explode
or
the
days
of
the
individual
in
the
would
have
ended
then
and
there
the
boys
stood
for
some
moments
with
their
guns
pointed
at
the
door
of
the
expecting
the
person
within
to
attempt
to
burst
out
but
the
click
of
the
hammer
and
their
hurried
conference
without
in
which
it
was
promptly
agreed
to
let
him
have
both
barrels
if
he
appeared
reconciled
him
to
remaining
within
after
some
time
it
was
decided
to
go
and
wake
uncle
balla
and
confer
with
him
as
to
the
proper
disposition
of
their
captive
accordingly
frank
went
off
to
obtain
help
while
willy
remained
to
watch
the
as
frank
left
he
called
back
willy
you
take
good
aim
at
him
and
if
he
pokes
his
head
out
let
him
have
it
this
willy
solemnly
promised
to
do
frank
was
hardly
out
of
hearing
before
willy
was
surprised
to
hear
the
prisoner
call
him
by
name
in
the
most
friendly
and
familiar
manner
although
the
voice
was
a
strange
one
willy
is
that
you
called
the
person
inside
yes
where
frank
gone
to
get
uncle
balla
did
you
see
that
other
fellow
yes
i
wish
you
shot
him
he
brought
me
here
and
played
a
joke
on
me
he
told
me
this
was
a
house
i
could
sleep
in
and
shut
me
up
in
here
and
blest
if
i
do
it
nothin
but
a
let
me
out
here
a
minute
he
continued
after
a
pause
cajolingly
no
i
wo
said
willy
firmly
getting
his
gun
ready
there
was
a
pause
and
then
from
the
depths
of
the
issued
the
most
awful
groan
umm
ummm
ummmm
willy
was
frightened
umm
umm
was
repeated
what
the
matter
with
you
asked
willy
feeling
sorry
in
spite
of
himself
oh
oh
oh
i
so
sick
groaned
the
man
in
the
how
what
the
matter
that
man
that
fooled
me
in
here
gave
me
something
to
drink
and
pizened
me
oh
oh
oh
i
dying
it
was
a
horrible
groan
willy
heart
relented
he
moved
to
the
door
and
was
just
about
to
open
it
to
look
in
when
a
light
flashed
across
the
yard
from
uncle
balla
house
and
he
saw
him
coming
with
a
flaming
knot
in
his
hand
chapter
instead
of
opening

groan

muttered
the
man
inside
the
boys
could
see
that
he
was
stretched
out
on
the
floor
apparently
asleep
and
that
he
was
a
soldier
in
uniform
balla
stepped
inside
is
he
dead
asked
both
boys
as
balla
caught
him
by
the
arms

and

floor

he
said
scratching
his
head

the
old
man
walked
up

and
standing
on
one
side
flung
it
open

an
frank

come
up
when
we
did
willy
stepped
back
abashed
his
heart
accused
him
and
told
him
the
charge
was
true
still
he
ventured
one
more
question
had
you
better
take
the
hens

teck
nuttin
out
dyah
ef
he
comes

dyahson
trouble
nuttin
and
the
old
man
pushed
to
the
door
and
fastened
the
iron
hasp
over
the
strong
staple
then
as
the
lock
had
been
broken
he
took
a
large
nail
from
his
pocket
and
fastened
it
in
the
staple
with
a
stout
string
so
that
it
could
not
be
shaken
out
all
the
time
he
was
working
he
was
talking
to
the
boys
or
rather
to
himself
for
their
benefit
now
you
see
ef
we
don
find
him
heah
in
the
mornin

stalls

he

butt
like
a
ram
to
git

dis
log
he
said
finally
as
he
finished
tying
the
last
knot
in
his
string
and
gave
the
door
a
vigorous
rattle
to
test
its
strength
willy
had
been
too
much
abashed
at
his
mistake
to
fully
appreciate
all
of
the
witticisms
over
the
prisoner
but
frank
enjoyed
them
almost
as
much
as
unc
balla
himself
now
y
all

up
dyah
the
boys
went
off
to
bed
willy
still
feeling
depressed
over
his
ridiculous
mistake
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
and
if
the
dogs
barked
again
they
did
not
hear
them
the
next
thing
they
knew
lucy
ann
convulsed
with
laughter
was
telling
them
a
story
about
uncle
balla
and
the
man
in
the
they
jumped
up
and
pulling
on
their
clothes
ran
out
in
the
yard
thinking
to
see
the
prisoner
instead
of
doing
so
they
found
uncle
balla
standing
by
the
with
a
comical
look
of
mystification
and
chagrin
the
roof
had
been
lifted
off
at
one
end
and
not
only
the
prisoner
but
every
chicken
was
gone
the
boys
were
half
inclined
to
cry
balla
look
however
set
them
to
laughing
unc
balla
you
got
to
give
me
every
chicken
you
got
you
said
you

said
willy

horse

the
roof
before
have
you
said
frank
go
from
here
i
tell
you
said
the
old
man
walking
around
the
house
looking
at
it
as
the
boys
went
back
to
wash
and
dress
themselves
they
heard
balla
explaining
to
lucy
ann
and
some
of
the
other
servants
that
the
man
them
chillern
let
git
away
had
just
come
back
and
tooken
out
the
one
he
had
locked
up
a
solution
of
the
mystery
he
always
stoutly
insisted
upon
one
thing
however
the
person
escape
effected
it
prevented
ever
hearing
any
more
of
his
mistake
but
that
did
not
keep
him
now
and
then
from
asking
uncle
balla
if
he
had
fastened
his
horses
well
chapter
vi
these
hens
were
not
the
last
things
stolen
from
oakland
nearly
all
the
men
in
the
country
had
gone
with
the
army
indeed
with
the
exception
of
a
few
overseers
who
remained
to
work
the
farms
every
man
in
the
neighborhood
between
the
ages
of
seventeen
and
fifty
was
in
the
army
the
country
was
thus
left
almost
wholly
unprotected
and
it
would
have
been
entirely
so
but
for
the
home
guard
as
it
was
called
which
was
a
company
composed
of
young
boys
and
the
few
old
men
who
remained
at
home
and
who
had
volunteered
for
service
as
a
local
guard
or
police
body
for
the
neighborhood
of
their
homes
occasionally
too
later
on
a
small
detachment
of
men
under
a
leader
known
as
a
would
come
through
the
country
hunting
for
any
men
who
were
subject
to
the
conscript
law
but
who
had
evaded
it
and
for
deserters
who
had
run
away
from
the
army
and
refused
to
return
these
two
classes
of
troops
however
stood
on
a
very
different
footing
the
home
guard
was
regarded
with
much
respect
for
it
was
composed
of
those
whose
extreme
age
or
youth
alone
withheld
them
from
active
service
and
every
youngster
in
its
ranks
looked
upon
it
as
a
training
school
and
was
ready
to
die
in
defence
of
his
home
if
need
were
and
besides
expected
to
obtain
permission
to
go
into
the
army
next
year
the
on
the
other
hand
were
grown
men
and
were
thought
to
be
shirking
the
very
dangers
and
hardships
into
which
they
were
trying
to
force
others
a
few
miles
from
oakland
on
the
side
toward
the
mountain
road
and
beyond
the
big
woods
lay
a
district
of
virgin
forest
and
pines
which
even
before
the
war
had
acquired
a
reputation
of
an
unsavory
nature
though
its
inhabitants
were
a
harmless
people
no
highways
ran
through
this
region
and
the
only
roads
which
entered
it
were
mere
filled
with
bushes
and
carpeted
with
and
being
travelled
only
by
the
inhabitants
appeared
to
outsiders
to
jes
peter
out
as
the
phrase
went
this
territory
was
known
by
the
unpromising
name
of
holetown
its
denizens
were
a
peculiar
but
kindly
race
known
to
the
boys
as
poor
white
folks
and
called
by
the
negroes
with
great
contempt
po
white
trash
some
of
them
owned
small
places
in
the
pines
but
the
majority
were
simply
tenants
they
were
an
inoffensive
people
and
their
worst
vices
were
intemperance
and
evasion
of
the
they
made
their
living
or
rather
they
existed
by
fishing
and
hunting
and
to
eke
it
out
attempted
the
cultivation
of
little
patches
of
corn
and
tobacco
near
their
cabins
or
in
the
bottoms
where
small
branches
ran
into
the
stream
already
mentioned
in
appearance
they
were
usually
so
thin
and
sallow
that
one
had
to
look
at
them
twice
to
see
them
clearly
at
best
they
looked
vague
and
illusive
they
were
brave
enough
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
nearly
all
of
the
men
in
this
community
enlisted
thinking
as
many
others
did
that
war
was
more
like
play
than
work
and
consisted
more
of
resting
than
of
laboring
although
most
of
them
when
in
battle
showed
the
greatest
fearlessness
yet
the
duties
of
camp
soon
became
irksome
to
them
and
they
grew
sick
of
the
restraint
and
drilling
of
so
some
of
them
when
refused
a
furlough
took
it
and
came
home
others
stayed
at
home
after
leave
had
ended
feeling
secure
in
their
stretches
of
pine
and
swamp
not
only
from
the
feeble
efforts
of
the
but
from
any
parties
who
might
be
sent
in
search
of
them
in
this
way
it
happened
as
time
went
by
that
holetown
became
known
to
harbor
a
number
of
deserters
according
to
the
negroes
it
was
full
of
them
and
many
stories
were
told
about
glimpses
of
men
dodging
behind
trees
in
the
big
woods
or
rushing
away
through
the
underbrush
like
wild
cattle
and
though
the
grown
people
doubted
whether
the
negroes
had
not
been
startled
by
some
of
the
hogs
which
were
quite
wild
feeding
in
the
woods
the
boys
were
satisfied
that
the
negroes
really
had
seen
deserters
this
became
a
certainty
when
there
came
report
after
report
of
these
and
when
the
with
the
brightest
of
uniforms
rode
by
with
as
much
show
and
noise
as
if
on
a
then
it
became
known
that
deserters
were
indeed
infesting
the
piny
district
of
holetown
and
in
considerable
numbers
some
of
them
it
was
said
were
pursuing
agriculture
and
all
their
ordinary
vocations
as
openly
as
in
time
of
peace
and
more
industriously
they
had
a
regular
code
of
signals
and
nearly
every
person
in
the
holetown
settlement
was
in
league
with
them
when
the
came
along
there
would
be
a
rush
of
children
through
the
woods
or
some
of
the
women
about
the
cabins
would
blow
a
horn
lustily
after
which
not
a
man
could
be
found
in
all
the
district
the
horn
told
just
how
many
men
were
in
the
guard
and
which
path
they
were
following
every
member
of
the
troop
being
honored
with
a
short
quick
toot
what
are
you
horn
for
sternly
asked
the
guard
one
morning
of
an
old
woman
old
hall
who
stood
out
in
front
of
her
little
house
blowing
like
boreas
in
the
pictures
jes
blowin
fur
millindy
to
come
to
dinner
she
said
sullenly
ca
y
all
let
a
po
call
her
gals
to
git
to
eat
you
got
all
her
boys
in
killin
why
yo
go
and
git
kilt
some
ridin
heah
tromplin
all
over
folk
chickens
when
the
troop
returned
in
the
evening
she
was
still
blowing
blowin
fur
millindy
to
come
home
she
said
with
more
sharpness
than
before
but
there
must
have
been
many
millindys
for
horns
were
sounding
all
through
the
settlement
the
deserters
at
such
times
were
said
to
take
to
the
swamps
and
marvellous
rumors
were
abroad
of
one
or
more
caves
all
fitted
up
wherein
they
concealed
themselves
like
the
robbers
in
the
stories
the
boys
were
so
fond
of
reading
after
a
while
thefts
of
pigs
and
sheep
became
so
common
that
they
were
charged
to
the
deserters
finally
it
grew
to
be
such
a
pest
that
the
ladies
in
the
neighborhood
asked
the
home
guard
to
take
action
in
the
matter
and
after
some
delay
it
became
known
that
this
valorous
body
was
going
to
invade
holetown
and
capture
the
deserters
or
drive
them
away
hugh
was
to
accompany
them
of
course
and
he
looked
very
handsome
as
well
as
very
important
when
he
started
out
on
horseback
to
join
the
troop
it
was
his
first
active
service
and
with
his
trousers
in
his
boots
and
his
pistol
in
his
belt
he
looked
as
brave
as
julius
cæsar
and
quite
laughed
at
his
mother
fears
for
him
as
she
kissed
him
and
walked
out
with
him
to
his
horse
which
balla
held
at
the
gate
the
boys
asked
leave
to
go
with
him
but
hugh
was
so
scornful
over
their
request
and
looked
so
soldierly
as
he
galloped
away
with
the
other
men
that
the
boys
felt
as
cheap
as
possible
chapter
vii
when
the
boys
went
into
the
house
they
found
that
their
aunt
mary
had
a
headache
that
morning
and
even
with
the
best
intentions
of
doing
her
duty
in
teaching
them
had
been
forced
to
go
to
bed
their
mother
was
too
much
occupied
with
her
charge
of
providing
for
a
family
of
over
a
dozen
white
persons
and
five
times
as
many
colored
dependents
to
give
any
time
to
acting
as
substitute
in
the
so
the
boys
found
themselves
with
a
holiday
before
them
it
seemed
vain
to
try
to
shoot
duck
on
the
creek
and
the
perch
were
averse
to
biting
the
boys
accordingly
determined
to
take
both
guns
and
to
set
out
for
a
real
hunt
in
the
big
woods
they
received
their
mother
permission
and
after
a
lunch
was
prepared
they
started
in
high
glee
talking
about
the
squirrels
and
birds
they
expected
to
kill
frank
had
his
gun
and
willy
had
the
musket
and
both
carried
a
plentiful
supply
of
powder
and
some
tolerably
round
slugs
made
from
cartridges
they
usually
hunted
in
the
part
of
the
woods
nearest
the
house
and
they
knew
that
game
was
not
very
abundant
there
so
as
a
good
long
day
was
before
them
they
determined
to
go
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
woods
they
accordingly
pushed
on
taking
a
path
which
led
through
the
forest
they
went
entirely
through
the
big
woods
without
seeing
anything
but
one
squirrel
and
presently
found
themselves
at
the
extreme
edge
of
holetown
they
were
just
grumbling
at
the
lack
of
game
when
they
heard
a
distant
horn
the
sound
came
from
perhaps
a
mile
or
more
away
but
was
quite
distinct
what
that
somebody
or
is
it
a
asked
willy
listening
intently
it
a
horn
to
warn
deserters
that
what
is
said
frank
pleased
to
show
his
superior
knowledge
i
tell
you
what
to
do
let
go
and
hunt
deserters
said
willy
eagerly
all
right
wo
that
be
fun
and
both
boys
set
out
down
the
road
toward
a
point
where
they
knew
one
of
the
paths
ran
into
the
talking
of
the
numbers
of
prisoners
they
expected
to
take
in
an
instant
they
were
as
alert
and
eager
as
young
hounds
on
a
trail
they
had
mapped
out
a
plan
before
and
they
knew
exactly
what
they
had
to
do
frank
was
the
captain
by
right
of
his
being
older
and
willy
was
lieutenant
and
was
to
obey
orders
the
chief
thing
that
troubled
them
was
that
they
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
by
any
of
the
women
or
children
about
the
cabins
for
they
all
knew
the
boys
because
they
were
accustomed
to
come
to
oakland
for
supplies
then
too
the
boys
wished
to
remain
on
friendly
terms
with
their
neighbors
another
thing
worried
them
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
their
prisoners
after
they
should
have
captured
them
however
they
pushed
on
and
soon
came
to
a
dim
which
ran
at
to
the
main
road
and
which
went
into
the
very
heart
of
holetown
here
they
halted
to
reconnoitre
and
to
inspect
their
weapons
even
from
the
main
road
the
track
as
it
led
off
through
the
overhanging
woods
with
thick
underbrush
of
chinquapin
bushes
appeared
to
the
boys
to
have
something
strange
about
it
though
they
had
at
other
times
walked
it
from
end
to
end
still
they
entered
boldly
clutching
their
guns
willy
suggested
that
they
should
go
in
indian
file
and
that
the
rear
one
should
step
in
the
other
footprints
as
the
indians
do
but
frank
thought
it
was
best
to
walk
abreast
as
the
indians
walked
in
their
peculiar
way
only
to
prevent
an
enemy
who
crossed
their
trail
from
knowing
how
many
they
were
and
so
far
from
it
being
any
disadvantage
for
the
deserters
to
know
number
it
was
even
better
that
they
should
know
there
were
two
so
that
they
would
not
attack
from
the
rear
accordingly
keeping
abreast
they
struck
in
each
taking
the
woods
on
one
side
of
the
road
which
he
was
to
watch
and
for
which
he
was
to
be
responsible
the
farther
they
went
the
more
indistinct
the
track
became
and
the
wilder
became
the
surrounding
woods
they
proceeded
with
great
caution
examining
every
particularly
thick
clump
of
bushes
peeping
behind
each
very
large
tree
and
occasionally
even
taking
a
glance
up
among
its
boughs
for
they
had
themselves
so
often
planned
how
if
pursued
they
would
climb
trees
and
conceal
themselves
that
they
would
not
have
been
at
all
surprised
to
find
a
fierce
deserter
armed
to
the
teeth
crouching
among
the
branches
though
they
searched
carefully
every
spot
where
a
deserter
could
possibly
lurk
they
passed
through
the
oak
woods
and
were
deep
in
the
pines
without
having
seen
any
foe
or
heard
a
noise
which
could
possibly
proceed
from
one
a
squirrel
had
daringly
leaped
from
the
trunk
of
a
and
run
into
the
woods
right
before
them
stopping
impudently
to
take
a
good
look
at
them
but
they
were
hunting
larger
game
than
squirrels
and
they
resisted
the
temptation
to
take
a
shot
at
him
an
exercise
of
virtue
which
brought
them
a
distinct
feeling
of
pleasure
they
were
however
beginning
to
be
embarrassed
as
to
their
next
course
they
could
hear
the
dogs
barking
farther
on
in
the
pines
and
knew
they
were
approaching
the
vicinity
of
the
settlement
for
they
had
crossed
the
little
creek
which
ran
through
a
thicket
of
elder
bushes
and
gums
and
which
marked
the
boundary
of
holetown
little
paths
too
every
now
and
then
turned
off
from
the
main
track
and
went
into
the
pines
each
leading
to
a
cabin
or
bit
of
deeper
in
they
therefore
were
in
a
real
dilemma
concerning
what
to
do
and
willy
suggestion
to
eat
lunch
was
a
welcome
one
they
determined
to
go
a
little
way
into
the
woods
where
they
could
not
be
seen
and
had
just
taken
the
lunch
out
of
the
and
were
turning
into
a
when
they
met
a
man
who
was
coming
along
at
a
slow
lounging
walk
and
carrying
a
long
across
his
arm
when
first
they
heard
him
they
thought
he
might
be
a
deserter
but
when
he
came
nearer
they
saw
that
he
was
simply
a
countryman
out
hunting
for
his
old
from
which
peeped
a
squirrel
tail
was
over
his
shoulder
and
he
had
no
weapon
at
all
excepting
that
old
good
morning
sir
said
both
boys
politely
mornin
what
luck
y
all
had
he
asked
stopping
and
putting
the
butt
of
his
gun
on
the
ground
and
resting
lazily
on
it
preparatory
to
a
chat
we
not
hunting
we
hunting
deserters
huntin
deserters
echoed
the
man
with
a
smile
which
broke
into
a
chuckle
of
amusement
as
the
thought
worked
its
way
into
his
brain
ai
you
see
none
no
said
both
boys
in
a
breath
greatly
pleased
at
his
friendliness
do
you
know
where
any
are
the
man
scratched
his
head
seeming
to
reflect
well
to
me
i
hearn
tell
o
some
making
a
comprehensive
sweep
of
his
arm
in
the
direction
just
opposite
to
that
which
the
boys
were
taking
i
seen
the
a
little
while
ago
pokin
but
lor
that
ain
the
way
to
ketch
deserters
i
knows
every
foot
o
groun
an
ef
they
was
any
deserters
roun
here
i
be
mighty
apt
to
know
it
this
announcement
was
an
extinguisher
to
the
boys
hopes
clearly
they
were
going
in
the
wrong
direction
we
are
just
going
to
eat
our
lunch
said
frank
wo
you
join
us
willy
added
his
invitation
to
his
brother
and
their
friend
politely
accepted
suggesting
that
they
should
walk
back
a
little
way
and
find
a
log
this
all
three
did
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
enjoying
the
lunch
which
the
boys
mother
had
provided
while
the
stranger
was
telling
the
boys
his
views
about
deserters
which
to
say
the
least
were
very
original
i
seen
the
jes
this
mornin
ridin
whar
they
knowd
they
warn
no
deserters
but
ole
womens
and
children
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
why
they
go
whar
they
knows
deserters
he
asked
where
are
they
we
heard
they
had
a
cave
down
on
the
river
and
we
were
going
there
declared
the
boys
down
on
the
river
a
cave

no
cave

thar
without
below
rockett
mill
fur
i
hunted
and
fished

o
that
river
up
an
down
both
sides
an
a
hole
thar
big
enough
to
hide
a
ole
hyah
i
ain
know
this
proof
was
too
conclusive
to
admit
of
further
argument
why
do
go
in
the
army
asked
willy
after
a
brief
reflection
what
why
do
go
in
the
army
repeated
the
hunter
why
the
army
you
didn
think
i
war
in
the
army
did
you
the
hunter
tone
and
the
expression
of
his
face
were
so
full
of
surprise
that
willy
felt
deeply
mortified
at
his
rudeness
and
began
at
once
to
stammer
something
to
explain
himself
i
to
colonel
marshall
regiment
continued
the
man
i
been
home
sick
on
leave
o

and
to
demonstrate
his
lameness
he
got
up
and
limped
a
few
yards
i
ain
well
yit
he
pursued
returning
and
dropping
into
his
seat
on
the
log
with
his
face
drawn
up
by
the
pain
the
exertion
had
brought
on
let
me
see
your
wound
is
it
sore
now
asked
willy
moving
nearer
to
the
man
with
a
look
expressive
of
mingled
curiosity
and
sympathy

ca
see
it

up
heah
said
the
soldier
touching
the
upper
part
of
his
hip
an
i
got
another
one
heah
he
added
placing
his
hand
very
gently
to
his
side
this
one
whar
a
yankee
run
me
through
with
his
sword
now
that
one
was
where
a
piece
of
shell
hit
me
i
do
keer
nothin
that
and
he
opened
his
shirt
and
showed
a
triangular
purple
scar
on
his
shoulder
you
certainly
must
be
a
brave
soldier
exclaimed
both
boys
impressed
at
sight
of
the
scar
their
voices
softened
by
fervent
admiration
yes

kep
up
with
the
bes

he
said
with
a
pleased
smile
suddenly
a
horn
began
to
blow
toot
toot
toot
as
if
all
the
millindys
in
the
world
were
being
summoned
it
was
so
near
the
boys
that
it
quite
startled
them
that
for
the
deserters

they
both
exclaimed
their
friend

calmly
up
and
down

road

ways

he
said
taking
the
squirrels
from
his
old
and
tossing
them
at
willy
feet
both
boys
protested
but
he
insisted
oh
yes
i
kin
get
some
mo

her
y
all
better
go
home
well
much
obliged
to
you
and
he
strolled
off
with
his
gun
in
the
bend
of
his
arm
leaving
the
boys
to
admire
and
talk
over
his
courage
they
turned
back
and
had
gone
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
they
heard
a
great
trampling
of
horses
behind
them
they
stopped
to
listen
and
in
a
little
while
a
squadron
of
cavalry
came
in
sight
the
boys
stepped
to
one
side
of
the
road
to
wait
for
them
eager
to
tell
the
important
information
they
had
received
from
their
friend
that
there
were
no
deserters
in
that
section
in
a
hurried
consultation
they
agreed
not
to
tell
that
they
had
been
hunting
deserters
themselves
as
they
knew
the
soldiers
would
only
have
a
laugh
at
their
expense
hello
boys
what
luck
called
the
officer
in
the
lead
in
a
friendly
manner
they
told
him
they
had
not
shot
anything
that
the
squirrels
had
been
given
to
them
and
then
both
boys
inquired
you
all
hunting
for
deserters
you
seen
any
asked
the
leader
carelessly
while
one
or
two
men
pressed
their
horses
forward
eagerly
no
th
ai
any
deserters
in
this
direction
at
all
said
the
boys
with
conviction
in
their
manner
how
do
you
know
asked
the
officer
a
gentleman
told
us
so
who
when
what
gentleman
a
gentleman
who
met
us
a
little
while
ago
how
long
ago
who
was
he
do
know
who
he
was
said
frank
when
we
were
eating
our
snack
put
in
willy
not
to
be
left
out
how
was
he
dressed
where
was
it
what
sort
of
man
was
he
eagerly
inquired
the
leading
trooper
the
boys
proceeded
to
describe
their
friend
impressed
by
the
intense
interest
accorded
them
by
the
listeners
he
was
a
sort
of
man
with
red
hair
and
wore
a
pair
of
gray
breeches
and
an
old
pair
of
shoes
and
was
in
his
frank
was
the
spokesman
and
he
had
a
gun
a
long
added
willy
and
he
said
he
belonged
to
colonel
marshall
regiment
why
that
tim
mills
he
a
deserter
himself
exclaimed
the
captain
no
he
ai
ai
any
deserter
protested
both
at
once
he
is
a
mighty
brave
soldier
and
he
been
home
on
a
furlough
to
get
well
of
a
wound
on
his
leg
where
he
was
shot
yes
and
it
ai
well
yet
but
he
going
back
to
his
command
or
morning
and
he
got
another
wound
in
his
side
where
a
yankee
ran
him
through
with
his
sword
we
know
ai
any
deserter
how
do
you
know
all
this
asked
the
officer
he
told
us
so
himself
just
now
a
little
while
ago
that
is
said
the
boys
the
man
laughed
why
he
fooled
you
to
death
that
tim
himself
that
been
doing
all
the
devilment
about
here
he
is
the
worst
deserter
in
the
whole
gang
we
saw
the
wound
on
his
shoulder
declared
the
boys
still
doubting
i
know
it
he
got
one
there
that
what
i
know
him
by
which
way
did
he
go
and
how
long
has
it
been
he
went
that
way
down
in
the
woods
and
it
been
some
time
got
away
now
the
lads
by
this
time
were
almost
convinced
of
their
mistake
but
they
could
not
prevent
their
sympathy
from
being
on
the
side
of
their
late
agreeable
companion
we
catch
the
rascal
declared
the
leader
very
fiercely
come
on
men
he
ca
have
gone
far
and
he
wheeled
his
horse
about
and
dashed
back
up
the
road
at
a
great
pace
followed
by
his
men
the
boys
were
half
inclined
to
follow
and
aid
in
the
capture
but
frank
after
a
moment
thought
said
solemnly
no
willy
an
arab
never
betrays
a
man
who
has
eaten
his
salt
this
man
has
broken
bread
with
us
we
can
not
give
him
up
i
do
think
we
ought
to
have
told
about
him
as
much
as
we
did
this
was
an
argument
not
to
be
despised
a
little
later
as
the
boys
trudged
home
they
heard
the
horns
blowing
again
a
regular
for
millindy
it
struck
them
that
supper
followed
dinner
very
quickly
in
holetown
when
the
troop
passed
by
in
the
evening
the
men
were
in
very
bad
humor
they
had
had
a
fruitless
addition
to
their
ride
and
some
of
them
were
inclined
to
say
that
the
boys
had
never
seen
any
man
at
all
which
the
boys
thought
was
pretty
silly
as
the
man
had
eaten
at
least
of
their
lunch
somehow
the
story
got
out
and
hugh
was
very
scornful
because
the
boys
had
given
their
lunch
to
a
deserter
chapter
viii
as
time
went
by
the
condition
of
things
at
oakland
changed
as
it
did
everywhere
else
the
boys
mother
like
all
the
other
ladies
of
the
country
was
so
devoted
to
the
cause
that
she
gave
to
the
soldiers
until
there
was
nothing
left
after
that
there
was
a
failure
of
the
crops
and
the
immediate
necessities
of
the
family
and
the
hands
on
the
place
were
great
there
was
no
sugar
nor
coffee
nor
tea
these
luxuries
had
been
given
up
long
before
an
attempt
was
made
to
manufacture
sugar
out
of
the
sorghum
or
which
was
now
being
cultivated
as
an
experiment
but
it
proved
unsuccessful
and
molasses
made
from
the
cane
was
the
only
sweetening
the
boys
however
never
liked
anything
sweetened
with
molasses
so
they
gave
up
everything
that
had
molasses
in
it
sassafras
tea
was
tried
as
a
substitute
for
tea
and
a
drink
made
out
of
parched
corn
and
wheat
of
burnt
sweet
potato
and
other
things
in
the
place
of
coffee
but
none
of
them
were
fit
to
drink
at
least
so
the
boys
thought
the
wheat
crop
proved
a
failure
but
the
corn
turned
out
very
fine
and
the
boys
learned
to
live
on
corn
bread
as
there
was
no
wheat
bread
the
soldiers
still
came
by
and
the
house
was
often
full
of
young
officers
who
came
to
see
the
boys
cousins
the
boys
used
to
ride
the
horses
to
and
from
the
stables
and
being
perfectly
fearless
became
very
fine
riders
several
times
among
the
visitors
came
the
young
colonel
who
had
commanded
the
regiment
that
had
camped
at
the
bridge
the
first
year
of
the
war
it
did
not
seem
to
the
boys
that
cousin
belle
liked
him
for
she
took
much
longer
to
dress
when
he
came
and
if
there
were
other
officers
present
she
would
take
very
little
notice
of
the
colonel
both
boys
were
in
love
with
her
and
after
considerable
hesitation
had
written
her
a
joint
letter
to
tell
her
so
at
which
she
laughed
heartily
and
kissed
them
both
and
called
them
her
sweethearts
but
though
they
were
jealous
of
several
young
officers
who
came
from
time
to
time
they
felt
sorry
for
the
colonel
their
cousin
was
so
mean
to
him
they
were
on
the
best
terms
with
him
and
had
announced
their
intention
of
going
into
his
regiment
if
only
the
war
should
last
long
enough
when
he
came
there
was
always
a
scramble
to
get
his
horse
though
of
all
who
came
to
oakland
he
rode
the
wildest
horses
as
both
boys
knew
by
practical
experience
at
length
the
soldiers
moved
off
too
far
to
permit
them
to
come
on
visits
and
things
were
very
dull
so
it
was
for
a
long
while
but
one
evening
in
may
about
sunset
as
the
boys
were
playing
in
the
yard
a
man
came
riding
through
the
place
on
the
way
to
richmond
his
horse
showed
that
he
had
been
riding
hard
he
asked
the
nearest
way
to
bridge
the
yankees
he
said
were
coming
it
was
a
raid
he
had
ridden
ahead
of
them
and
had
left
them
about
greenbay
depot
which
they
had
set
on
fire
he
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
stop
and
get
something
to
eat
and
he
rode
off
leaving
much
excitement
behind
him
for
greenbay
was
only
eight
miles
away
and
oakland
lay
right
between
two
roads
to
richmond
down
one
or
the
other
of
which
the
party
of
raiders
must
certainly
pass
it
was
the
first
time
the
boys
ever
saw
their
mother
exhibit
so
much
emotion
as
she
then
did
she
came
to
the
door
and
called
balla
come
here
her
voice
sounded
to
the
boys
a
little
strained
and
troubled
and
they
ran
up
the
steps
and
stood
by
her
balla
came
to
the
portico
and
looked
up
with
an
air
of
inquiry
he
too
showed
excitement
balla

know
that
if
you
wish
to
go

hi

began
balla
with
an
air
of
reproach
but
she
cut
him
short
and
kept
on
i
want
you
all
to
know
it
she
was
speaking
now
so
as
to
be
heard
by
the
cook
and
the
maids
who
were
standing
about
the
yard
listening
to
her
i
want
you
all
to
know
it
every

on

he
turned
and
pointed
up
to
the
dark
clumps
of
trees
that
marked
the
graveyard
on
the
hill
a
half
mile
away
where
the
colored
people
were
buried

one
of
the
women
in
the
yard
the
boys
mother
started
to
say
something
further
to
balla
but
though
she
opened
her
lips
she
did
not
speak
she
turned
suddenly
and
walked
into
the
house
and
into
her
chamber
where
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
the
boys
thought
she
was
angry
but
when
they
softly
followed
her
a
few
minutes
afterward
she
got
up
hastily
from
where
she
had
been
kneeling
beside
the
bed
and
they
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
a
murmur
under
the
window
called
them
back
to
the
portico
it
had
begun
to
grow
dark
but
a
bright
spot
was
glowing
on
the
horizon
and
on
this
every
one
gaze
was
fixed
where
is
it
balla
what
is
it
asked
the
boys
mother
her
voice
no
longer
strained
and
harsh
but
even
softer
than

depot

he
gave
a
nervous

of
laugh

their
mistress
to
the
servants
she
went
to

undertone

the
boys
heard
him
say
their
mother
sent
the
boys
out
she
went
and
locked
herself
in
her
room
but
they
heard
her
footsteps
as
she
turned
about
within
and
now
and
then
they
heard
her
opening
and
shutting
drawers
and
moving
chairs
in
a
little
while
she
came
out
frank
you
and
willy
go
and
tell
balla
to
come
to
the
chamber
door
he
may
be
out
in
the
stable
they
dashed
out
proud
to
bear
so
important
a
message
they
could
not
find
him
but
an
hour
later
they
heard
him
coming
from
the
stable
he
at
once
went
into
the
house
they
rushed
into
the
chamber
where
they
found
the
door
of
the
closet
open
balla
come
in
here
called
their
mother
from
within
have
you
got
them
safe
she

i
want
to
be
here
when
they
come
or
i
go
down
an
stay
whar
they
is
what
is
it
asked
the
boys
where
is
the
best
place
to
put
that
she
said
pointing
to
a
large
strong
box
in
which
they
knew
the
finest
silver
was
kept
indeed
all
excepting
what
was
used
every
day
on
the
table
well
i
declar
mistis
that
hard
to
tell
said
the
old
driver
without
it
in
the
stable
they
may
burn
that
down
that
so
you
might
bury
it
under
the
floor
of
the
i
have
heard
that
they
always
look
for
silver
there
said
the
mother
how
would
it
do
to
bury
it
in
the
garden
that
the
very
place
i
was
gwine
name
said
balla
with
flattering
approval
they
ca
burn
down
and
if
they
gwine
dig
for
it
then
they
have
to
dig
a
long
time
before
they
git
over
that
big
garden
he
stooped
and
lifted
up
one
end
of
the
box
to
test
its
weight
i
thought
of
the
other
end
of
the
between
the
big
and
the
lilac
that
the
very
place
i
had
in
my
mind
declared
the
old
man
they
won
never
fine
it
dyah
we
know
a
good
place
said
the
boys
both
together
it
a
heap
better
than
that
it
where
we
bury
our
treasures
when
we
play
the
pirate
very
well
said
their
mother
i
do
care
to
know
where
it
is
until
after
anyhow
i
know
i
can
trust
you
she
added
addressing
balla
yes
you
know
dat
said
he
simply
i
jes
go
an
git
my
hoe
the
garden
has
got
a
roof
to
it
has
it
unc
balla
asked
willy
quietly
go
from
here
boy
said
the
old
man
making
a
sweep
at
him
with
his
hand
that
boy
ain
never
done
talkin
that
thing
yit
he
added
with
a
pleased
laugh
to
his
mistress
and
you
ai
ever
given
me
all
those
chickens
either
responded
willy
forgetting
his
grammar
oh
well
i
do
it
ai
you
hear
me
say
i
gwine
do
it
he
laughed
as
he
went
out
the
boys
were
too
excited
to
get
sleepy
before
the
silver
was
hidden
their
mother
told
them
they
might
go
down
into
the
garden
and
help
balla
on
condition
that
they
would
not
talk
that
the
way
we
always
do
when
we
bury
the
treasure
ai
it
willy
asked
frank
if
a
man
speaks
it
death
declared
willy
slapping
his
hand
on
his
side
as
if
to
draw
a
sword
striking
a
theatrical
attitude
and
speaking
in
a
deep
voice
give
the
to
us
said
frank
no
be
off
with
you
said
their
mother
that
ai
the
way
said
frank
a
pirate
never
digs
the
hole
until
he
has
his
treasure
at
hand
to
do
so
would
prove
him
but
a
novice
would
it
willy
well
i
leave
it
all
to
you
my
little
buccaneers
said
their
mother
laughing
i
take
care
of
the
spoons
and
forks
we
use
every
day
i
just
hide
them
away
in
a
hole
somewhere
the
boys
started
off
after
balla
with
a
shout
but
remembered
their
errand
and
suddenly
hushed
down
to
a
little
squeal
of
delight
at
being
actually
engaged
in
burying
treasure
real
silver
it
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
and
withal
there
was
a
real
excitement
about
it
for
how
could
they
know
but
that
some
one
might
watch
them
from
some
or
might
even
fire
into
them
as
they
worked
they
met
the
old
fellow
as
he
was
coming
from
the
with
a
hoe
and
a
spade
in
his
hands
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
garden
in
a
very
straightforward
manner
but
the
boys
made
him
understand
that
to
bury
treasure
it
was
necessary
to
be
particularly
secret
and
after
some
little
grumbling
balla
humored
them
the
difficulty
of
getting
the
box
of
silver
out
of
the
house
secretly
whilst
all
the
family
were
up
and
the
servants
were
moving
about
was
so
great
that
this
part
of
the
affair
had
to
be
carried
on
in
a
manner
different
from
the
usual
programme
of
pirates
of
the
first
water
even
the
boys
had
to
admit
this
and
they
yielded
to
old
balla
advice
on
this
point
but
made
up
for
it
by
additional
formality
ceremony
and
secrecy
in
pointing
out
the
spot
where
the
box
was
to
be
hid
old
balla
was
quite
accustomed
to
their
games
and
fun
their
pranks
as
he
called
them
he
accordingly
yielded
willingly
when
they
marched
him
to
a
point
at
the
lower
end
of
the
yard
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
garden
and
left
him
but
he
was
inclined
to
give
trouble
when
they
both
reappeared
with
a
gun
and
in
a
whisper
announced
that
they
must
march
first
up
the
ditch
which
ran
by
the
spring
around
the
foot
of
the
garden
look
here
boys
i
ain
got
time
to
fool
with
you
chillern
said
the
old
man
ai
you
hear
your
ma
tell
me
she
on
me
to
bury
that
silver
what
yo
and
used
to
eat
off
o
an
don
nobody
to
know
nothin
it
an
y
all
comin
here
with
guns
like
you
huntin
an
now
talkin
wadin
in
the
ditch
but
unc
balla
that
the
way
all
buccaneers
do
protested
frank
yes
buccaneers
always
go
by
water
said
willy
and
we
can
stoop
in
the
ditch
and
come
in
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
so
nobody
can
see
us
added
frank
bookanear
or
bookafar
i
gwine
in
dat
garden
and
dig
a
hole
wid
my
hoe
an
i
is
too
ole
to
be
wadin
in
a
ditch
like
chillern
i
got
the
misery
in
my
knee
now
so
bad
able
to
stand
i
know
huccome
y
all
ai
satisfied
with
the
place
you
ma
an
i
done
pick
anyways
this
was
too
serious
a
mutiny
for
the
boys
so
it
was
finally
greed
that
one
gun
should
be
returned
to
the
office
and
that
they
should
enter
by
the
gate
after
which
balla
was
to
go
with
the
boys
by
the
way
they
should
show
him
and
see
the
spot
they
thought
of
they
took
him
down
through
the
weeds
around
the
garden
crouching
under
the
and
at
last
stopped
at
a
spot
under
the
slope
completely
surrounded
by
shrubbery
here
is
the
spot
said
frank
in
a
whisper
pointing
under
one
of
the
bushes
it
in
a
line
with
the
longest
limb
of
the
big
by
the
gate
added
willy
and
when
this
locust
bush
and
that
cedar
grow
to
be
big
trees
it
will
be
just
between
them
as
this
seemed
to
balla
a
very
good
place
he
set
to
work
at
once
to
dig
the
two
boys
helping
him
as
well
as
they
could
it
took
a
great
deal
longer
to
dig
the
hole
in
the
dark
than
they
had
expected
and
when
they
got
back
to
the
house
everything
was
quiet
the
boys
had
their
hats
pulled
over
their
eyes
and
had
turned
their
jackets
inside
out
to
disguise
themselves
it
a
place
ai
it
unc
balla
they
said
as
they
entered
the
chamber
where
their
mother
and
aunt
were
waiting
for
them
do
you
think
it
will
do
balla
their
mother
asked
oh
yes
madam
it
far
enough
an
they
got
mighty
comical
ways
to
get
dyah
wadin
in
ditch
an
things
it
will
do
i
ain
sho
i
kin
fin
it
myself
he
was
not
particularly
enthusiastic
now
however
he
shouldered
the
box
with
a
grunt
at
its
weight
and
the
party
went
slowly
out
through
the
back
door
into
the
dark
the
glow
of
the
burning
depot
was
still
visible
in
the
west
then
it
was
decided
that
willy
should
go
before
he
said
to
reconnoitre
balla
said
to
open
the
gate
and
lead
the
way
and
that
frank
should
bring
up
the
rear
they
trudged
slowly
on
through
the
darkness
frank
and
willy
watching
on
every
side
old
balla
stooping
under
the
weight
of
the
big
box
after
they
were
some
distance
in
the
garden
they
heard
or
thought
they
heard
a
sound
back
at
the
gate
but
decided
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
latch
clicking
and
they
went
on
down
to
their
hiding
place
in
a
little
while
the
black
box
was
well
settled
in
the
hole
and
the
dirt
was
thrown
upon
it
the
replaced
earth
made
something
of
a
mound
which
was
unfortunate
they
had
not
thought
of
this
but
they
covered
it
with
leaves
and
agreed
that
it
was
so
well
hidden
the
yankees
would
never
dream
of
looking
there
unc
balla
where
are
your
horses
asked
one
of
the
boys
that
for
me
to
know
an
them
to
find
out
what
kin
replied
the
old
fellow
with
a
chuckle
of
satisfaction
the
whole
party
crept
back
out
of
the
garden
and
the
boys
were
soon
dreaming
of
buccaneers
and
pirates
chapter
ix
the
boys
were
not
sure
that
they
had
even
fallen
asleep
when
they
heard
lucy
ann
call
outside
they
turned
over
to
take
another
nap
she
was
coming
up
to
the
door
no
for
it
was
a
man
step
it
must
be
uncle
balla
they
heard
horses
trampling
and
people
talking
in
a
second
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
man
strode
into
the
room
followed
by
one
two
a
others
all
white
and
all
in
uniform
they
were
yankees
the
boys
were
too
frightened
to
speak
they
thought
they
were
arrested
for
hiding
the
silver
get
up
you
lazy
little
rebels
cried
one
of
the
intruders
not
unpleasantly
as
the
boys
were
not
very
quick
in
obeying
being
really
too
frightened
to
do
more
than
sit
up
in
bed
the
man
caught
the
mattress
by
the
end
and
lifting
it
with
a
jerk
emptied
them
and
all
the
bedclothes
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
a
heap
at
this
all
the
other
men
laughed
a
minute
more
and
he
had
drawn
his
sword
the
boys
expected
no
less
than
to
be
immediately
killed
they
were
almost
paralyzed
but
instead
of
plunging
his
sword
into
them
the
man
began
to
stick
it
into
the
mattresses
and
to
rip
them
up
while
others
pulled
open
the
drawers
of
the
bureau
and
pitched
the
things
on
the
floor
the
boys
felt
themselves
to
be
in
a
very
exposed
and
defenceless
condition
and
willy
who
had
become
tangled
in
the
bedclothes
and
had
been
a
little
hurt
in
falling
now
that
the
strain
was
somewhat
over
began
to
cry
in
a
minute
a
shadow
darkened
the
doorway
and
their
mother
stood
in
the
room
leave
the
room
instantly
she
cried
are
you
ashamed
to
frighten
children
we
have
hurt
the
brats
said
the
man
with
the
sword
well
you
terrify
them
to
death
it
just
as
bad
give
me
those
clothes
and
she
sprang
forward
and
snatched
the
boys
clothes
from
the
hands
of
a
man
who
had
taken
them
up
she
flung
the
suits
to
the
boys
who
lost
no
time
in
slipping
into
them
they
had
at
once
recovered
their
courage
in
the
presence
of
their
mother
she
seemed
to
them
as
she
braved
the
intruders
the
grandest
person
they
had
ever
seen
her
face
was
white
but
her
eyes
were
like
coals
of
fire
they
were
very
glad
she
had
never
looked
or
talked
so
to
them
when
they
got
outdoors
the
yard
was
full
of
soldiers
they
were
upon
the
porches
in
the
entry
and
in
the
house
the
was
open
and
so
were
the
doors
of
all
the
other
outhouses
and
now
and
then
a
man
passed
carrying
some
article
which
the
boys
recognized
in
a
little
while
the
soldiers
had
taken
everything
they
could
carry
conveniently
and
even
things
which
must
have
caused
them
some
inconvenience
they
had
secured
all
the
bacon
that
had
been
left
in
the
as
well
as
all
other
eatables
they
could
find
it
was
a
queer
sight
to
see
the
fellows
sitting
on
their
horses
with
a
ham
or
a
pair
of
fowls
tied
to
one
side
of
the
saddle
and
an
engraving
or
a
package
of
books
or
some
ornament
to
the
other
a
new
party
of
men
had
by
this
time
come
up
from
the
direction
of
the
stables
old
man
come
here
called
some
of
them
to
balla
who
was
standing
near
expostulating
with
the
men
who
were
about
the
fire
who
me
asked
balla

said
the
fellow
roughly
taking
out
his
pistol
in
a
threatening
way
the
old
man
eyes
grew
wide
hi

questioner
seizing

by

and
jerking

angrily
around

pretty
quick
where
those
horses

bullet
or

there
he
was
backed
by
a
more
but
the
pistol
which
was
at
old
balla
head
was
his
most
efficient
ally
hi

protested
balla
there
is
no
telling
how
much
further
his
courage
could
have
withstood
their
threats
for
the
boys
mother
made
her
appearance
she
was
about
to
bid
balla
show
where
the
horses
were
when
a
party
rode
into
the
yard
leading
them
hi

exclaimed
the
boys
recognizing
the
black
which

exclaimed
the
old
driver
forgetting
his
fear
of
the
cocked
pistols
gentlemen

he
pleaded
pushing
through
the
group
that
surrounded
him
and
approaching
the
man
who
led
the
horses
they
only
laughed
at
him
illustration
gentlemen

said
uncle
balla
both
the
boys
ran
to
their
mother
and
flinging
their
arms
about
her
burst
out
crying
in
a
few
minutes
the
men
started
off
riding
across
the
fields
and
in
a
little
while
not
a
soldier
was
in
sight
i
wish
marse
william
could
see
you
ridin
them
fields
said
balla
looking
after
the
retiring
troop
in
futile
indignation
investigation
revealed
the
fact
that
every
horse
and
mule
on
the
plantation
had
been
carried
off
except
only
two
or
three
old
mules
which
were
evidently
considered
not
worth
taking
chapter
x
after
this
times
were
very
hard
on
the
plantation
but
the
mother
struggled
to
provide
as
best
she
could
for
the
family
and
hands
she
used
to
ride
all
over
the
county
to
secure
the
supplies
which
were
necessary
for
their
support
one
of
the
boys
usually
being
her
escort
and
riding
behind
her
on
one
of
the
old
mules
that
the
raiders
had
left
in
this
way
the
boys
became
acquainted
with
the
roads
of
the
county
and
even
with
all
the
in
the
neighborhood
of
their
home
many
of
these
were
dim
enough
too
running
through
stretches
of
pine
forest
across
old
fields
which
were
little
better
than
jungle
along
gullies
up
ditches
and
through
woods
mile
after
mile
they
were
generally
useful
only
to
a
race
such
as
the
negroes
which
had
an
instinct
for
direction
like
that
shown
by
some
animals
but
the
boys
learned
to
follow
them
unerringly
and
soon
became
as
skilful
in
keepin
de
parf
as
any
on
the
plantation
as
the
year
passed
the
times
grew
harder
and
harder
and
the
expeditions
made
by
the
boys
mother
became
longer
and
longer
and
more
and
more
frequent
the
meat
gave
out
and
worst
of
all
they
had
no
hogs
left
for
next
year
the
plantation
usually
subsisted
on
bacon
but
now
there
was
not
a
pig
left
on
the
place
unless
the
old
wild
sow
in
the
big
woods
who
had
refused
to
be
driven
up
the
fall
before
still
survived
which
was
doubtful
for
the
most
diligent
search
was
made
for
her
without
success
and
it
was
conceded
that
even
she
had
fallen
prey
to
the
deserters
nothing
was
heard
of
her
for
months
one
day
in
the
autumn
the
boys
were
out
hunting
in
the
big
woods
in
the
most
distant
and
wildest
part
where
they
sloped
down
toward
a
little
marshy
branch
that
ran
into
the
river
a
mile
or
two
away
it
was
a
very
dry
spell
and
squirrels
were
hard
to
find
owing
the
boys
agreed
to
the
noise
made
in
tramping
through
the
dry
leaves
finally
they
decided
to
station
themselves
each
at
the
foot
of
a
hickory
and
wait
for
the
squirrels
they
found
two
large
hickory
trees
not
too
far
apart
and
took
their
positions
each
on
the
ground
with
his
back
to
a
tree
it
was
very
dull
waiting
and
a
colloquy
was
passing
between
them
as
to
the
advisability
of
giving
it
up
when
a
faint
cranch
cranch
cranch
sounded
in
the
dry
leaves
at
first
the
boys
thought
it
was
a
squirrel
and
both
of
them
grasped
their
guns
then
the
sound
came
again
but
this
time
there
appeared
to
be
not
one
but
a
number
of
animals
rustling
slowly
along
what
is
it
asked
frank
of
willy
whose
tree
was
a
little
nearer
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
came
anything
but
some
cows
or
sheep
i
believe
said
willy
in
a
disappointed
tone
the
look
of
interest
died
out
of
frank
face
but
he
still
kept
his
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
which
was
now
very
distinct
the
underbrush
however
was
too
thick
for
them
to
see
anything
at
length
willy
rose
and
pushed
his
way
rapidly
through
the
bushes
toward
the
animals
there
was
a
sudden
oof
oof
and
frank
heard
them
rushing
back
down
through
the
woods
toward
the
marsh
somebody
hogs
he
muttered
in
disgust
frank
frank
called
willy
in
a
most
excited
tone
what
it
the
old
spotted
sow
and
she
got
a
lot
of
pigs
with
her
great
big
shoats
nearly
grown
frank
sprang
up
and
ran
through
the
bushes
at
least
six
of
let
follow
all
right
the
boys
stooping
their
heads
struck
out
through
the
bushes
in
the
direction
from
which
the
yet
retreating
animals
could
still
be
heard
let
shoot
all
right
on
they
kept
as
hard
as
they
could
what
great
news
it
was
what
royal
game
it
like
hunting
wild
boars
is
it
shouted
willy
joyfully
they
followed
the
track
left
by
the
animals
in
the
leaves
kicked
up
in
their
mad
flight
it
led
down
over
the
hill
through
the
thicket
and
came
to
an
end
at
the
marsh
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
swamp
beyond
that
it
could
not
be
traced
but
it
was
evident
that
the
wild
hogs
had
taken
refuge
in
the
impenetrable
recesses
of
the
marsh
which
was
their
home
chapter
xi
after
circling
the
edge
of
the
swamp
for
some
time
the
boys
as
it
was
now
growing
late
turned
toward
home
they
were
full
of
their
valuable
discovery
and
laid
all
sorts
of
plans
for
the
capture
of
the
hogs
they
would
not
tell
even
their
mother
as
they
wished
to
surprise
her
they
were
of
course
familiar
with
all
the
modes
of
trapping
game
as
described
in
the
story
books
and
they
discussed
them
all
the
easiest
way
to
get
the
hogs
was
to
shoot
them
and
this
would
be
the
most
fun
but
it
would
never
do
for
the
meat
would
spoil
when
they
reached
home
they
hunted
up
uncle
balla
and
told
him
about
their
discovery
he
was
very
much
inclined
to
laugh
at
them
the
hogs
they
had
seen
were
nothing
he
told
them
but
some
of
the
neighbors
hogs
which
had
wandered
into
the
woods
when
the
boys
went
to
bed
they
talked
it
over
once
more
and
determined
that
next
day
they
would
thoroughly
explore
the
woods
and
the
swamp
also
as
far
as
they
could
the
following
afternoon
therefore
they
set
out
and
made
immediately
for
that
part
of
the
woods
where
they
had
seen
and
heard
the
hogs
the
day
before
one
of
them
carried
a
gun
and
the
other
a
long
after
finding
the
trail
they
followed
it
straight
down
to
the
swamp
rolling
their
trousers
up
above
their
knees
they
waded
boldly
in
selecting
an
opening
between
the
bushes
which
looked
like
a
they
proceeded
slowly
for
the
briers
were
so
thick
in
many
places
that
they
could
hardly
make
any
progress
at
all
when
they
neared
the
branch
so
they
turned
and
worked
their
way
painfully
down
the
stream
at
last
however
they
reached
a
place
where
the
brambles
and
bushes
seemed
to
form
a
perfect
wall
before
them
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
let
go
home
said
willy
any
use
to
try
to
get
through
there
my
legs
are
scratched
all
to
pieces
now
let
try
and
get
out
here
said
frank
and
he
turned
from
the
wall
of
brambles
they
crept
along
springing
from
hummock
to
hummock
presently
they
came
to
a
spot
where
the
oozy
mud
extended
at
least
eight
or
ten
feet
before
the
next
tuft
of
grass
how
am
i
to
get
the
gun
across
asked
willy
dolefully
that
a
fact
it
too
far
to
throw
it
even
with
the
caps
off
at
length
they
concluded
to
go
back
for
a
piece
of
log
they
had
seen
and
to
throw
this
down
so
as
to
lessen
the
distance
they
pulled
the
log
out
of
the
sand
carried
it
to
the
muddy
spot
and
threw
it
into
the
mud
where
they
wanted
it
frank
stuck
his
pole
down
and
felt
until
he
had
what
he
thought
a
secure
hold
on
it
fixed
his
eye
on
the
tuft
of
grass
beyond
and
sprang
into
air
as
he
jumped
the
pole
slipped
from
its
insecure
support
into
the
miry
mud
and
frank
instead
of
landing
on
the
hummock
for
which
he
had
aimed
lost
his
direction
and
soused
flat
on
his
side
with
a
loud
in
the
water
and
mud
three
feet
to
the
left
he
was
a
queer
object
as
he
staggered
to
his
feet
in
the
quagmire
but
at
the
instant
a
loud
oof
oof
came
from
the
thicket
not
a
dozen
yards
away
and
the
whole
herd
of
hogs
roused
by
his
fall
from
slumber
in
their
muddy
lair
dashed
away
through
the
swamp
with
oofs
of
fear
there
they
go
there
they
go
shouted
both
boys
eagerly
willy
in
his
excitement
splashing
across
the
quagmire
and
finding
it
not
so
deep
as
it
had
looked
there
where
they
go
in
and
out
exclaimed
frank
pointing
to
a
low
round
opening
not
more
than
eighteen
inches
high
a
little
further
beyond
them
which
formed
an
arch
in
the
almost
solid
wall
of
brambles
surrounding
the
place
as
it
was
now
late
they
returned
home
resolving
to
wait
until
the
next
afternoon
before
taking
any
further
steps
there
was
not
a
pound
of
bacon
to
be
obtained
anywhere
in
the
country
for
love
or
money
and
the
flock
of
sheep
was
almost
gone
their
mother
anxiety
as
to
means
for
keeping
her
dependents
from
starving
was
so
great
that
the
boys
were
on
the
point
of
telling
her
what
they
knew
and
when
they
heard
her
wishing
she
had
a
few
hogs
to
fatten
they
could
scarcely
keep
from
letting
her
know
their
plans
at
last
they
had
to
jump
up
and
run
out
of
the
room
next
day
the
boys
each
hunted
up
a
pair
of
old
boots
which
they
had
used
the
winter
before
the
leather
was
so
dry
and
worn
that
the
boots
hurt
their
growing
feet
cruelly
but
they
brought
the
boots
along
to
put
on
when
they
reached
the
swamp
this
time
each
took
a
gun
and
they
also
carried
an
axe
for
now
they
had
determined
on
a
plan
for
capturing
the
hogs
i
wish
we
had
let
peter
and
cole
come
said
willy
dolefully
sitting
on
the
butt
end
of
a
log
they
had
cut
and
wiping
his
face
on
his
sleeve
or
had
asked
uncle
balla
to
help
us
added
frank
they
be
certain
to
tell
all
about
it
yes
so
they
would
they
settled
down
in
silence
and
panted
i
tell
you
what
we
ought
to
do
bait
the
as
you
would
for
fish
this
was
the
suggestion
of
the
angler
frank
with
what
acorns
the
acorns
were
tolerably
plentiful
around
the
roots
of
the
big
oaks
so
the
boys
set
to
work
to
pick
them
up
it
was
an
easier
job
than
cutting
the
log
and
it
was
not
long
before
each
had
his
hat
full
as
they
started
down
to
the
swamp
frank
exclaimed
suddenly
look
there
willy
willy
looked
and
not
fifty
yards
away
with
their
ends
resting
on
old
stumps
were
three
or
four
hacks
or
piles
of
rails
which
had
been
mauled
the
season
before
and
left
there
probably
having
been
forgotten
or
overlooked
willy
gave
a
hurrah
while
bending
under
the
weight
of
a
large
rail
at
the
spot
where
the
came
out
of
the
thicket
they
commenced
to
build
their
trap
first
they
laid
a
floor
of
rails
then
they
built
a
pen
five
or
six
rails
high
which
they
strengthened
with
outriders
when
the
pen
was
finished
they
pried
up
the
side
nearest
the
thicket
from
the
bottom
rail
about
a
foot
that
is
high
enough
for
the
animals
to
enter
this
they
did
by
means
of
two
rails
using
one
as
a
fulcrum
and
one
as
a
lever
having
shortened
them
enough
to
enable
the
work
to
be
done
from
inside
the
pen
the
lever
they
pulled
down
at
the
farther
end
until
it
touched
the
bottom
of
the
trap
and
fastened
it
by
another
rail
a
thin
one
run
at
to
the
lever
and
across
the
pen
this
would
slip
easily
when
pushed
away
from
the
gap
and
needed
to
be
moved
only
about
an
inch
to
slip
from
the
end
of
the
lever
and
release
it
the
weight
of
the
pen
would
then
close
the
gap
behind
this
rail
the
acorns
were
to
be
thrown
and
the
hogs
in
trying
to
get
the
bait
would
push
the
rail
free
the
lever
or
trigger
and
the
gap
would
be
closed
by
the
fall
of
the
pen
when
the
lever
was
released
it
was
nearly
night
when
the
boys
finished
they
scattered
a
portion
of
the
acorns
for
bait
along
the
path
and
up
into
the
pen
to
toll
the
hogs
in
the
rest
they
strewed
inside
the
pen
beyond
their
sliding
rail
they
could
scarcely
tear
themselves
away
from
the
pen
but
it
was
so
late
they
had
to
hurry
home
next
day
was
sunday
but
monday
morning
by
daylight
they
were
up
and
went
out
with
their
guns
apparently
to
hunt
squirrels
they
went
however
straight
to
their
trap
as
they
approached
they
thought
they
heard
the
hogs
grunting
in
the
pen
willy
was
sure
of
it
and
they
ran
as
hard
as
they
could
but
there
were
no
hogs
there
after
going
every
morning
and
evening
for
two
weeks
there
never
had
been
even

said
lucy
ann
in
her
usual
teasing
way
this
was
too
much
for
the
boys
to
stand
after
all
they
had
done
uncle
balla
must
be
right
they
would
have
to
admit
it
the
hogs
must
have
belonged
to
some
one
else
and
their
mother
was
in
such
desperate
straits
about
meat
lucy
ann
last
shot
about
catching
hall
hogs
took
effect
and
the
boys
agreed
that
they
would
go
out
some
afternoon
and
pull
the
pen
down
the
next
afternoon
they
took
their
guns
and
started
out
on
a
they
did
not
have
much
luck
however
let
go
by
there
and
pull
the
old
pen
down
said
frank
as
they
started
homeward
from
the
far
side
of
the
woods
it
out
of
the
way
let
the
old
thing
rip
we
better
pull
it
down
if
a
hog
were
to
be
caught
there
it
would
do
i
wish
he
would
but
there
ai
any
hogs
going
to
get
caught
growled
willy
he
might
starve
to
death
this
suggestion
persuaded
willy
who
could
not
bear
to
have
anything
suffer
so
they
sauntered
down
toward
the
swamp
as
they
approached
it
a
squirrel
ran
up
a
tree
and
both
boys
were
after
it
in
a
second
they
were
standing
one
on
each
side
of
the
tree
gazing
up
trying
to
get
a
sight
of
the
little
animal
among
the
gray
branches
when
a
sound
came
to
the
ears
of
both
of
them
at
the
same
moment
what
that
both
asked
together
it
hogs
grunting
no
they
are
fighting
they
are
in
the
swamp
let
run
said
willy
no
we
scare
them
away
they
may
be
near
the
trap
was
prudent
suggestion
let
creep
up
i
hear
young
pigs
squealing
do
you
think
they
are
ours
the
squirrel
was
left
flattened
out
and
trembling
on
top
of
a
large
limb
and
the
boys
stole
down
the
hill
toward
the
pen
the
hogs
were
not
in
sight
though
they
could
be
heard
grunting
and
scuffling
they
crept
closer
willy
crawled
through
a
thick
clump
of
bushes
and
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
shout
we
got
we
got
he
cried
running
toward
the
pen
followed
by
frank
sure
enough
there
they
were
fast
in
the
pen
fighting
and
snorting
to
get
out
and
tearing
around
with
the
bristles
high
on
their
round
backs
the
old
sow
and
seven
large
young
hogs
while
a
litter
of
eight
little
pigs
as
the
boys
ran
up
squeezed
through
the
rails
and
squealing
dashed
away
into
the
grass
the
hogs
were
almost
frantic
at
the
sight
of
the
boys
and
rushed
madly
at
the
sides
of
the
pen
but
the
boys
had
made
it
too
strong
to
be
broken
after
gazing
at
their
capture
awhile
and
piling
a
few
more
outriders
on
the
corners
of
the
pen
to
make
it
more
secure
the
two
trappers
rushed
home
they
dashed
breathless
and
panting
into
their
room
shouting
we
got
we
got
and
seizing
her
began
to
dance
up
and
down
with
her
in
a
little
while
the
whole
plantation
was
aware
of
the
capture
and
old
balla
was
sent
out
with
them
to
look
at
the
hogs
to
make
sure
they
did
not
belong
to
some
one
else
as
he
insisted
they
did
the
boys
went
with
him
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
returned
but
as
he
came
in
the
proof
of
the
boys
success
was
written
on
his
face
he
was
in
a
broad
grin
to
his
mistress
inquiry
he
replied
yes
they
got
sho
they
the
beatenes
boys
for
some
time
afterward
he
would
every
now
and
then
break
into
a
chuckle
of
amused
content
and
exclaim
them
right
smart
chillern
and
at
christmas
when
the
hogs
were
killed
this
was
the
opinion
of
the
whole
plantation
chapter
xii
the
gibes
of
lucy
ann
and
the
occasional
little
thrusts
of
hugh
about
the
deserter
business
continued
and
kept
the
boys
stirred
up
at
length
they
could
stand
it
no
longer
it
was
decided
between
them
that
they
must
retrieve
their
reputations
by
capturing
a
real
deserter
and
turning
him
over
to
the
whose
office
was
at
the
depot
accordingly
one
saturday
they
started
out
on
an
expedition
the
object
of
which
was
to
capture
a
deserter
though
they
should
die
in
the
attempt
the
had
been
unusually
active
lately
and
it
was
said
that
several
deserters
had
been
caught
the
boys
turned
in
at
their
old
road
and
made
their
way
into
holetown
their
guns
were
loaded
with
large
slugs
and
they
felt
the
ardor
of
battle
thrill
them
as
they
marched
along
down
the
narrow
roadway
they
were
trudging
on
when
they
were
hailed
by
name
from
behind
turning
they
saw
their
friend
tim
mills
coming
along
at
the
same
slouching
gait
in
which
he
always
walked
his
old
gun
was
thrown
across
his
arm
and
he
looked
a
little
rustier
than
on
the
day
he
had
shared
their
lunch
the
boys
held
a
little
whispered
conversation
and
decided
on
a
treaty
of
friendship
he
said
on
coming
up
to
them
how
your
ma
she

the
boys
promised

the
wily
johnson
all
they
asked

to
have
him
pointed
out
to

enough
soldier
for

the
boys
laughed
at
his
dry
tone
as
they
walked
along
they
consulted
how
the
capture
should
be
made
i
tell
you
how
to
take
him
said
their
companion
he
is
a
monstrous
coward
and
all
you
got
to
do
is
jest
to
bring
your
guns
down
on
him
i
would
shoot
him
he
tried
to
run
but
if
he
did
that
when
he
got
a
little
distance
i
pepper
him
about
his
legs
make
him
give
up
his
sword
and
pistol
and
do
let
him
ride
if
you
do
he
git
away
make
him
walk
the
rascal
the
boys
promised
to
carry
out
these
kindly
suggestions
they
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
little
house
where
mills
said
the
deserter
was
a
soldier
horse
was
standing
tied
at
the
gate
with
a
sword
hung
from
the
saddle
the
owner
in
full
uniform
was
sitting
on
the
porch
i
ca
go
any
furder
whispered
their
friend
but
him
that
lee
the
triflin
scoundrel
loafin
here
o

army
i
y
all
is
to
take
him
eyeing
the
boys
suspiciously
no
we
ai
you
see
said
both
boys
fired
at
the
doubt
all
right
i
goin
to
wait
right
here
and
watch
you
go
ahead
the
boys
looked
at
the
guns
to
see
if
they
were
all
right
and
marched
up
the
road
keeping
their
eyes
on
the
enemy
it
was
agreed
that
frank
was
to
do
the
talking
and
give
the
orders
they
said
not
a
word
until
they
reached
the
gate
they
could
see
a
young
woman
moving
about
in
the
house
setting
a
table
at
the
gate
they
stopped
so
as
to
prevent
the
man
from
getting
to
his
horse
the
soldier
eyed
them
curiously
i
wonder
whose
boys
they
is
he
said
to
himself
they
certainly
actin
comical
playin
soldiers
i
reckon
cock
your
gun
easy
said
frank
in
a
low
tone
suiting
his
own
action
to
the
word
willy
obeyed
come
out
here
if
you
please
frank
called
to
the
man
he
could
not
keep
his
voice
from
shaking
a
little
but
the
man
rose
and
lounged
out
toward
them
his
prompt
compliance
reassured
them
they
stood
gripping
their
guns
and
watching
him
as
he
advanced
come
outside
the
gate
he
did
as
frank
said
what
do
you
want
he
asked
impatiently
you
are
our
prisoner
said
frank
sternly
dropping
down
his
gun
with
the
muzzle
toward
the
captive
and
giving
a
glance
at
willy
to
see
that
he
was
supported
your
what
do
you
mean
we
arrest
you
as
a
deserter
how
proud
willy
was
of
frank
go
from
here
i
ai
no
deserter
i
for
deserters
myself
the
man
replied
laughing
frank
smiled
at
willy
with
a
nod
as
much
as
to
say
you
see
just
what
tim
told
us
ai
your
name
billy
johnson
yes
that
my
name
you
are
the
man
we
looking
for
march
down
that
road
but
run
if
you
do
we
shoot
you
as
the
boys
seemed
perfectly
serious
and
the
muzzles
of
both
guns
were
pointing
directly
at
him
the
man
began
to
think
that
they
were
in
earnest
but
he
could
hardly
credit
his
senses
a
suspicion
flashed
into
his
mind
look
here
boys
he
said
rather
angrily
i
do
want
any
of
your
foolin
with
me
i
too
old
to
play
with
children
if
you
all
go
home
and
stop
giving
me
impudence
i
slap
you
over
he
started
angrily
toward
frank
as
he
did
so
frank
brought
the
gun
to
his
shoulder
stand
back
he
said
looking
along
the
barrel
right
into
the
eyes
if
you
move
a
step
i
blow
your
head
off
the
soldier
jaw
fell
he
stopped
and
threw
up
his
arm
before
his
eyes
hold
on
he
called
do
shoot
boys
ai
you
got
better
sense
that
march
on
down
that
road
willy
you
get
the
horse
said
frank
decidedly
the
soldier
glanced
over
toward
the
house
the
voice
of
the
young
woman
was
heard
singing
a
war
song
in
a
high
key
ef
millindy
sees
me
i
a
goner
he
reflected
jes
come
down
the
road
a
little
piece
will
you
he
asked
persuasively
no
talking
march
ordered
frank
he
looked
at
each
of
the
boys
the
guns
still
kept
their
perilous
direction
the
boys
eyes
looked
fiery
to
his
surprised
senses
who
is
y
all
he
asked
we
are
two
little
confederates
that
who
we
are
said
willy
is
any
of
your
parents
ever
ever
been
in
a
asylum
he
asked
as
calmly
as
he
could
that
none
of
your
business
said
captain
frank
march
on
the
man
cast
a
despairing
glance
toward
the
house
where
the
years
were
creeping
slowly
by
lorena
in
a
very
high
pitch
and
then
moved
on
i
hope
she
ai
seen
nothin
he
thought
if
i
jest
can
git
them
guns
away
from
frank
followed
close
behind
him
with
his
old
gun
held
ready
for
need
and
willy
untied
the
horse
and
led
it
the
bushes
concealed
them
from
the
dwelling
as
soon
as
they
were
well
out
of
sight
of
the
house
frank
gave
the
order
halt
they
all
halted
willy
tie
the
horse
it
was
done
i
wonder
if
those
boys
is
thinkin
shootin

thought
the
soldier
turning
and
putting
his
hand
on
his
pistol
as
he
did
so
frank
gun
came
to
his
shoulder
throw
up
your
hands
or
you
are
a
dead
man
the
hands
went
up
willy
keep
your
gun
on
him
while
i
search
him
for
any
weapons
willy
cocked
the
old
musket
and
brought
it
to
bear
on
the
prisoner
little
boy
do
handle
that
thing
so
reckless
the
man
expostulated
ef
that
musket
was
to
go
off
it
might
kill
me
no
talking
demanded
frank
going
up
to
him
hold
up
your
hands
willy
shoot
him
if
he
moves
frank
drew
a
long
pistol
from
its
holster
with
an
air
of
business
he
searched
carefully
but
there
was
no
more
the
fellow
gritted
his
teeth
if
she
ever
hears
of
tim
got
her
certain
he
groaned
but
she
wo
never
hear
at
a
turn
in
the
road
his
heart
sank
within
him
for
just
around
the
curve
they
came
upon
tim
mills
sitting
quietly
on
a
stump
he
looked
at
them
with
a
quizzical
eye
but
said
not
a
word
the
prisoner
face
was
a
study
when
he
recognized
his
rival
and
enemy
as
mills
did
not
move
his
courage
returned
good
mornin
tim
he
said
with
great
politeness
the
man
on
the
stump
said
nothing
he
only
looked
on
with
complacent
enjoyment
tim
is
these
two
boys
crazy
he
asked
slowly
they
crazy
shootin

replied
tim

voice
was
full
of
entreaty
well
if

what

the
army

began
the
fellow
fiercely
but
tim
shifted
his
long
lazily
into
his
hand
and
looked
the
man
straight
in
the
eyes
and
the
prisoner
stopped
yes
i
know
said
tim
with
a
sudden
spark
in
his
eyes
an
know
he
added
after
a
pause
during
which
his
face
resumed
its
usual
listless
look
an
my
edvice

forehead
expressively

frank
illustration
frank
and
willy
capture
a
member
of
the
the
prisoner
grinding
his
teeth
moved
forward
followed
by
his
guards
as
the
enemies
parted
each
man
sent
the
same
ugly
look
after
the
other
it
all
over
he
got
her
groaned
johnson
as
they
passed
out
of
sight
mills
rose
and
sauntered
somewhat
briskly
for
him
in
the
direction
of
john
hall
they
soon
reached
a
little
stream
not
far
from
the
depot
where
the
was
stationed
on
its
banks
the
man
made
his
last
stand
but
his
obstinacy
brought
a
black
muzzle
close
to
his
head
with
a
stern
little
face
behind
it
and
he
was
fain
to
march
straight
through
the
water
as
he
was
ordered
just
as
he
was
emerging
on
the
other
bank
with
his
boots
full
of
water
and
his
trousers
dripping
closely
followed
by
frank
brandishing
a
pistol
a
small
body
of
soldiers
rode
up
they
were
the
johnson
look
was
despairing
why
billy
what
in
thunder
thought
you
were
sick
in
bed
another
minute
and
the
soldiers
took
in
the
situation
by
instinct
and
johnson
rage
was
drowned
in
the
universal
explosion
of
laughter
the
boys
had
captured
a
member
of
the
in
the
midst
of
all
frank
and
willy
overwhelmed
by
their
ridiculous
error
took
to
their
heels
as
hard
as
they
could
and
the
last
sounds
that
reached
them
were
the
roars
of
the
soldiers
as
the
scampering
boys
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
dust
johnson
went
back
in
a
few
days
to
see
john
hall
daughter
but
the
young
lady
declared
she
would
marry
any
man
who
let
two
boys
make
him
wade
through
a
creek
and
a
month
or
two
later
she
married
tim
mills
to
all
the
gibes
he
heard
on
the
subject
of
his
capture
and
they
were
many
johnson
made
but
one
reply
them
boys
had
parents
in
a
a
sylum
chapter
xiii
it
was
now
nearing
the
end
of
the
third
year
of
the
war
hugh
was
seventeen
and
was
eager
to
go
into
the
army
his
mother
would
have
liked
to
keep
him
at
home
but
she
felt
that
it
was
her
duty
not
to
withhold
anything
and
colonel
marshall
offered
hugh
a
place
with
him
so
a
horse
was
bought
and
hugh
went
to
richmond
and
came
back
with
a
uniform
and
a
sabre
the
boys
truly
thought
that
general
lee
himself
was
not
so
imposing
or
so
great
a
soldier
as
hugh
they
followed
him
about
like
two
pet
dogs
and
when
he
sat
down
they
stood
and
gazed
at
him
adoringly
when
hugh
rode
away
to
the
army
it
was
harder
to
part
with
him
than
they
had
expected
and
though
he
had
left
them
his
gun
and
dog
to
console
them
during
his
absence
it
was
difficult
to
keep
from
crying
everyone
on
the
plantation
was
moved
uncle
balla
who
up
to
the
last
moment
had
been
very
lively
attending
to
the
horse
as
the
young
soldier
galloped
away
sank
down
on
the
end
of
the
steps
of
the
office
and
dropping
his
hands
on
his
knees
followed
hugh
with
his
eyes
until
he
disappeared
over
the
hill
the
old
driver
said
nothing
but
his
face
expressed
a
great
deal
the
boys
mother
cried
a
great
deal
but
it
was
generally
when
she
was
by
herself
she
afraid
hugh
be
kilt
willy
said
to
uncle
balla
in
explanation
of
her
tears
the
old
servant
having
remarked
that
he
she
cried
more
when
hugh
went
away
than
she
did
when
marse
john
and
marse
william
both
went
hi
war
she
they
be
kilt
too
he
asked
in
some
scorn
this
was
beyond
willy
logic
so
he
pondered
over
it
yes
but
she
afraid
hugh
be
kilt
as
as
them
he
said
finally
as
the
best
solution
of
the
problem
it
did
not
seem
to
wholly
satisfy
uncle
balla
mind
for
when
he
moved
off
he
said
as
though
talking
to
himself
she
is
on
that
boy
he
be
a
hisself
the
first
thing
she
know
there
was
a
bond
of
sympathy
between
uncle
balla
and
his
mistress
which
did
not
exist
so
strongly
between
her
and
any
of
the
other
servants
it
was
due
perhaps
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
companion
and
friend
of
her
boys
that
winter
the
place
where
the
army
went
into
winter
quarters
was
some
distance
from
oakland
but
the
young
officers
used
to
ride
over
from
time
to
time
two
or
three
together
and
stay
for
a
day
or
two
times
were
harder
than
they
had
been
before
but
the
young
people
were
as
gay
as
ever
the
colonel
who
had
been
dreadfully
wounded
in
the
summer
had
been
made
a
for
gallantry
hugh
had
received
a
slight
wound
in
the
same
action
the
general
had
written
to
the
boy
mother
about
him
but
he
had
not
been
home
the
general
had
gone
back
to
his
command
he
had
never
been
to
oakland
since
he
was
wounded
one
evening
the
boys
had
just
teased
their
cousin
belle
into
reading
them
their
nightly
portion
of
the
talisman
as
they
sat
before
a
bright
lightwood
fire
when
two
horsemen
galloped
up
to
the
gate
their
horses
splashed
with
mud
from
fetlocks
to
ears
in
a
second
lucy
ann
dashed
headlong
into
the
room
with
her
teeth
gleaming
here
marse
hugh
out
here
there
was
a
scamper
to
the
door
the
boys
first
shouting
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
cousin
belle
next
and
lucy
ann
close
at
her
heels
who
with
him
lucy
ann
asked
miss
belle
as
they
reached
the
and
heard
several
voices
outside
the
cunel
with
the
young
lady
turned
and
fled
up
the
steps
as
fast
as
she
could
you
see
i
brought
my
welcome
with
me
said
the
general
addressing
the
boy
mother
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
young
aide
shoulder
as
they
stood
a
little
later
thawing
out
by
the
roaring
in
the
you
always
bring
that
but
you
are
doubly
welcome
for
bringing
this
young
soldier
back
to
me
said
she
putting
her
arm
affectionately
around
her
son
just
then
the
boys
came
rushing
in
from
taking
the
horses
to
the
stable
they
made
a
dive
toward
the
fire
to
warm
their
little
chapped
hands
i
told
you
hugh
war
as
tall
as
the
general
said
frank
across
the
hearth
to
willy
who
said
he
was
you
i
did
you
did
they
were
a
contradictory
pair
of
youngsters
and
their
voices
pitched
in
a
youthful
treble
were
apt
in
discussion
to
strike
a
somewhat
higher
key
but
it
did
not
follow
that
they
were
in
an
merely
because
they
contradicted
each
other
what
you
say
if
you
did
say
that
insisted
frank
i
said
he
as
if
he
himself
as
tall
as
the
general
declared
willy
defiantly
oblivious
in
his
excitement
of
the
eldest
brother
presence
there
was
a
general
laugh
at
confusion
but
hugh
had
carried
an
order
across
a
field
under
a
hot
fire
and
had
brought
a
regiment
up
in
the
nick
of
time
riding
by
its
colonel
side
in
a
charge
which
had
changed
the
issue
of
the
fight
and
had
a
sabre
wound
in
the
arm
to
show
for
it
he
could
therefore
afford
to
pass
over
such
an
accusation
with
a
little
tweak
of
ear
where
cousin
belle
asked
frank
i
she
putting
on
her
fine
clothes
for
the
general
to
see
did
she
run
when
she
heard
he
was
here
willy
said
his
mother
reprovingly
well
she
did
ma
his
mother
shook
her
head
at
him
but
the
general
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
and
drew
him
closer
you
say
she
ran
he
asked
with
a
pleasant
light
in
his
eyes
yes
sirree
she
did
just
then
the
door
opened
and
their
cousin
belle
entered
the
room
she
looked
perfectly
beautiful
the
greetings
were
very
cordial
to
hugh
especially
she
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
young
hero
she
cried
oh
hugh
i
am
so
proud
of
you
kissing
him
again
and
laughing
at
him
with
her
face
glowing
and
her
big
brown
eyes
full
of
light
where
were
you
wounded
oh
i
was
so
frightened
when
i
heard
about
it
where
was
it
show
it
to
us
hugh
please
do
exclaimed
both
boys
at
once
jumping
around
him
and
pulling
at
his
arm
oh
hugh
is
it
still
very
painful
asked
his
cousin
her
pretty
face
filled
with
sudden
sympathy
oh
no
it
was
nothing
nothing
but
a
scratch
said
hugh
shaking
the
boys
off
his
expression
being
divided
between
feigned
indifference
and
sheepishness
at
this
praise
in
the
presence
of
his
chief
no
such
thing
miss
belle
put
in
the
general
glad
of
the
chance
to
secure
her
commendation
it
might
have
been
very
serious
and
it
was
a
splendid
ride
he
made
were
you
not
ashamed
of
yourself
to
send
him
into
such
danger
she
said
turning
on
him
suddenly
why
did
you
not
go
yourself
the
young
man
laughed
her
beauty
entranced
him
he
had
scars
enough
to
justify
him
in
keeping
silence
under
her
pretended
reproach
well
you
see
i
could
leave
the
place
where
i
was
i
had
to
send
some
one
and
i
knew
hugh
would
do
it
he
led
the
regiment
after
the
colonel
and
major
fell
and
he
did
it
splendidly
too
there
was
a
chorus
from
the
young
lady
and
the
boys
together
oh
hugh
you
hear
what
he
says
exclaimed
the
former
turning
to
her
cousin
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
he
thinks
so
then
recollecting
that
she
was
paying
him
the
highest
compliment
she
suddenly
began
to
blush
and
turned
once
more
to
him
well
you
talk
as
if
you
were
surprised
did
you
expect
anything
else
there
was
a
fine
scorn
in
her
voice
if
it
had
been
real
certainly
not
you
are
all
too
clever
at
making
an
attack
he
said
coolly
looking
her
in
the
eyes
but
i
have
heard
even
of
running
away
he
added
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
when
she
asked
quickly
with
a
little
guilty
color
deepening
in
her
face
as
she
glanced
at
the
boys
i
never
did
oh
she
did
exclaimed
both
boys
in
a
breath
breaking
in
now
that
the
conversation
was
within
their
range
you
ought
to
have
seen
her
she
just
exclaimed
frank
the
girl
made
a
rush
at
the
offender
to
stop
him
he
does
know
what
he
is
talking
about
she
said
roguishly
over
her
shoulder
yes
he
does
called
the
other
she
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
when
you
all
came
and
oo
oo
oo
the
rest
was
lost
as
his
cousin
placed
her
hand
close
over
his
mouth
here
here
run
away
you
are
too
dangerous
they
do
know
what
they
are
talking
about
she
said
throwing
a
glance
toward
the
young
officer
who
was
keenly
enjoying
her
confusion
her
hand
slipped
from
willy
mouth
and
he
went
on
and
when
she
heard
it
was
you
she
just
clapped
her
hands
and
ran
oo
oo
umm
here
hugh
put
them
out
she
said
to
that
young
man
who
glad
to
do
her
bidding
seized
both
miscreants
by
their
arms
and
carried
them
out
closing
the
door
after
them
hugh
bore
the
boys
into
the
where
he
kept
them
until
after
supper
the
rest
of
the
family
dispersed
and
the
boys
mother
invited
them
to
come
with
her
and
hugh
to
her
own
room
though
they
were
eager
to
go
and
see
the
general
and
were
much
troubled
lest
he
should
think
their
mother
was
rude
in
leaving
him
chapter
xiv
the
next
day
was
sunday
the
general
and
hugh
had
but
one
day
to
stay
they
were
to
leave
at
daybreak
the
following
morning
they
thoroughly
enjoyed
their
holiday
at
least
the
boys
knew
that
hugh
did
they
had
never
known
him
so
affable
with
them
they
did
not
see
much
of
the
general
after
breakfast
he
seemed
to
like
to
stay
stuck
up
in
the
house
all
the
time
talking
to
cousin
belle
the
boys
thought
this
due
to
his
lameness
something
had
occurred
the
boys
understand
just
what
but
the
general
was
on
an
entirely
new
footing
with
all
of
them
and
their
cousin
belle
was
in
some
way
concerned
in
the
change
she
did
not
any
longer
run
from
the
general
and
it
seemed
to
them
as
though
everyone
acted
as
if
he
belonged
to
her
the
boys
did
not
altogether
like
the
state
of
affairs
that
afternoon
however
he
and
their
cousin
belle
let
the
boys
go
out
walking
with
them
and
he
was
just
as
hearty
as
he
could
be
he
made
them
tell
him
all
about
capturing
the
deserter
and
about
catching
the
hogs
and
everything
they
did
they
told
him
all
about
their
robbers
cave
down
in
the
woods
near
where
an
old
house
had
stood
it
was
between
two
ravines
near
a
spring
they
had
found
they
had
fixed
up
the
cave
with
boards
and
old
pieces
of
carpet
and
everything
and
they
told
him
as
a
secret
how
to
get
to
it
through
the
pines
without
leaving
a
trail
he
had
to
give
the
holy
pledge
of
the
brotherhood
before
this
could
be
divulged
to
him
but
he
took
it
with
a
solemnity
which
made
the
boys
almost
forgive
the
presence
of
their
cousin
belle
it
was
a
little
awkward
at
first
that
she
was
present
but
as
the
constitution
provided
only
as
to
admitting
men
to
the
mystic
knowledge
saying
nothing
about
women
this
difficulty
was
on
the
general
suggestion
passed
over
and
the
boys
fully
explained
the
location
of
the
spot
and
how
to
get
there
by
turning
off
abruptly
from
the
path
through
the
big
woods
right
at
the
pine
thicket
and
all
the
rest
of
the
way
a
cave
explained
willy
but
it
as
good
as
one
the
old
rock
is
just
like
a
cave
the
gullies
are
so
deep
you
ca
get
there
except
that
one
way
declared
frank
even
the
yankees
could
find
you
there
asserted
willy
i
do
believe
anybody
could
after
that
but
i
trust
they
will
never
have
to
try
laughed
their
cousin
belle
with
an
anxious
look
in
her
bright
eyes
at
the
mere
thought
that
night
they
were
at
supper
about
eight
when
something
attracted
the
attention
of
the
party
around
the
table
it
was
a
noise
a
something
indefinable
but
the
talk
and
mirth
stopped
suddenly
and
everybody
listened
there
was
a
call
and
the
hurried
steps
of
some
one
running
just
outside
the
door
and
lucy
ann
burst
into
the
room
her
face
ashy
pale
the
yard
full
o
mens
yankees
she
gasped
just
as
the
general
and
hugh
rose
from
the
table
how
many
are
there
asked
both
gentlemen
they
all
the
house
which
the
general
looked
at
his
sweetheart
she
came
to
his
side
with
a
cry
go
up
stairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
called
the
boys
mother
we
can
hide
you
come
with
us
said
the
boys
go
up
the
back
way
frank
willy
to
den
whispered
lucy
ann
that
where
we
are
going
said
the
boys
as
she
went
out
you
all
come
on
this
to
the
general
and
hugh
the
rest
of
you
take
your
seats
said
the
boys
mother
all
this
had
occupied
only
a
few
seconds
the
soldiers
followed
the
boys
out
by
a
and
dashed
up
the
narrow
stairs
to
the
just
as
a
thundering
knocking
came
at
the
front
door
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
for
candles
were
too
scarce
to
burn
more
than
one
at
a
time
you
run
back
said
hugh
to
the
boys
as
they
groped
along
there
are
too
many
of
us
i
know
the
way
but
it
was
too
late
the
noise
down
stairs
told
that
the
enemy
was
already
in
the
house
as
the
soldiers
left
the
the
boys
mother
had
hastily
removed
two
plates
from
the
places
and
set
two
chairs
back
against
the
wall
she
made
the
rest
fill
up
the
spaces
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
two
men
had
been
there
she
had
hardly
taken
her
seat
again
when
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
at
the
door
announced
the
approach
of
the
enemy
she
herself
rose
and
went
to
the
door
but
it
was
thrown
open
before
she
reached
it
and
an
officer
in
full
federal
uniform
strode
in
followed
by
several
men
the
commander
was
a
tall
young
fellow
not
older
than
the
general
the
lady
started
back
somewhat
startled
and
there
was
a
confused
chorus
of
exclamations
of
alarm
from
the
rest
of
those
at
the
table
the
officer
finding
himself
in
the
presence
of
ladies
removed
his
cap
with
a
polite
bow
i
hope
madam
that
you
ladies
will
not
be
alarmed
he
said
you
need
be
under
no
apprehension
i
assure
you
even
while
speaking
his
eye
had
taken
a
hasty
survey
of
the
room
we
desire
to
see
general
marshall

at
present
in
this
house
and

said
the
mistress
of
the
house
haughtily
i

glad
to
say

that

hardly
think

the
young
soldier
positively
but
with
great
politeness
i

positive
information
to

effect
they
arrived
last
evening
and

my
feelings
but

house

horses
began
the
lady
but
she
was
interrupted
by
lucy
ann
who
entered
at
the
moment
with
a
plate
of
fresh
and
caught
the
last
part
of
the
sentence
come
along
mister
she
said
i
show
you
myself
and
she
set
down
her
plate
took
the
candle
from
the
table
and
walked
to
the
door
followed
by
the
soldiers
lucy
ann
exclaimed
her
mistress
but
she
was
too
much
amazed
at
the
girl
conduct
to
say
more
i
know
whar

lucy
ann
continued
taking
no
notice
of
her
mistress
they
heard

she
was
shutting
the
door

the
other
that

asked
the

in
a
low
voice

but
i
know
whar

the
soldiers
closely
examined
every
place
where
it
was
possible
a
man
could
be
concealed
until
they
had
been
over
all
the
lower
part
of
the
house
lucy
ann
stopped

she
said
positively
the
officer

to
her
to
go
up
stairs

she
said
leading
the
way
talking
all
the
time
and
shading
the
flickering
candle
with
her
hand
the
little
group
flat
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
in
their
dark
retreat
could
now
hear
her
voice
distinctly
she
was
speaking
in
a
confidential
undertone
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
i
wonder
i
did
have
sense
to
get
somebody
to
watch
when
they
went
out
they
heard
her
say
she
betrayed
us
whispered
hugh
the
general
merely
said
hush
and
laid
his
hand
firmly
on
the
nearest
boy
to
keep
him
still
lucy
ann
led
the
soldiers
into
the
various
chambers
one
after
another
at
last
she
opened
the
next
room
and
through
the
wall
the
men
in
hiding
heard
the
soldiers
go
in
and
walk
about
they
estimated
that
there
were
at
least
is
there
a
garret
asked
one
of
the
searching
party
nor
sir
no
garret
jes
a

lucy

room

the
voice
of
the
officer
was
very
stern
i

what

o

said
the
girl
in
a
slightly
whimpering
voice
i
gwine
show
you
she
came
straight
down
the
passage
toward
the
recess
where
the
fugitives
were
huddled
the
men
after
her
their
heavy
steps
echoing
through
the
house
the
boys
were
trembling
violently
the
light
as
the
searchers
came
nearer
fell
on
the
wall
crept
along
it
until
it
lighted
up
the
whole
alcove
except
where
they
lay
the
boys
held
their
breath
they
could
hear
their
hearts
thumping
lucy
ann
stepped
into
the
recess
with
her
candle
and
looked
straight
at
them
they
ai
in
here
she
exclaimed
suddenly
putting
her
hand
up
before
the
flame
as
if
to
prevent
it
flaring
thus
throwing
the
alcove
once
more
into
darkness
the
to
the
garret
that
she
said
to
the
soldiers
still
keeping
her
position
at
the
narrow
entrance
as
if
to
let
them
pass
when
they
had
all
passed
she
followed
them
the
boys
began
to
wriggle
with
delight
but
the
general
strong
hand
kept
them
still
naturally
the
search
in
the
garret
proved
fruitless
and
the
heard
the
squad
swearing
over
their
as
they
came
back
while
lucy
ann
loudly
lamented
not
having
sent
some
one
to
follow
the
fugitives
and
made
a
number
of
suggestions
as
to
where
they
had
gone
and
the
probability
of
catching
them
if
the
soldiers
went
at
once
in
pursuit
did
you
look
in
here
asked
a
soldier
approaching
the
alcove
yes
sir
they
ai
in
there
she
snuffed
the
candle
out
suddenly
with
her
fingers
oh
oh
my
light
done
gone
out
mind
let
me
go
in
front
and
show
you
the
way
she
said
and
pressing
before
she
once
more
led
them
along
the
passage
mind
yo
steps
ken
you
see
she
asked
they
went
down
stairs
while
lucy
ann
gave
them
minute
directions
as
to
how
they
might
catch
marse
hugh
an
the
at
a
certain
place
a
from
the
house
an
unoccupied
quarter
which
she
carefully
described
a
further
investigation
ensued
downstairs
but
in
a
little
while
the
searchers
went
out
of
the
house
their
tone
had
changed
since
their
disappointment
and
loud
threats
floated
up
the
dark
stairway
to
the
prisoners
still
crouching
in
the
little
recess
in
a
few
minutes
the
boys
cousin
belle
came
rushing
up
stairs
now
your
time
come
quick
she
called
they
will
be
back
directly
is
she
an
angel
the
whole
party
sprang
to
their
feet
and
ran
down
to
the
lower
floor
oh
we
were
so
frightened
do
let
them
see
you
make
haste
were
the
exclamations
that
greeted
them
as
the
two
soldiers
said
their
and
prepared
to
leave
the
house
go
out
by
the
that
your
only
chance
it
and
the
bushes
will
hide
you
but
where
are
you
going
we
are
going
to
the
boys
cave
said
the
general
buckling
on
his
pistol
i
know
the
way
and
we
get
away
as
soon
as
these
fellows
leave
if
we
can
not
before
god
bless
you
said
the
ladies
pushing
them
away
in
dread
of
the
enemy
return
come
on
general
called
hugh
in
an
undertone
the
general
was
lagging
behind
a
minute
to
say
once
more
he
stooped
suddenly
and
kissed
the
boys
cousin
belle
before
them
all
god
bless
you
and
he
followed
hugh
out
of
the
window
into
the
darkness
the
girl
burst
into
tears
and
ran
up
to
her
room
a
few
seconds
afterward
the
house
was
once
more
filled
with
the
enemy
growling
at
their
in
having
so
narrowly
missed
the
prize
we
catch
yet
said
the
leader
chapter
xv
the
raiders
were
up
early
next
morning
scouring
the
woods
and
country
around
they
knew
that
the
fugitive
soldiers
could
not
have
gone
far
for
the
federals
had
every
road
picketed
and
their
main
body
was
not
far
away
as
the
morning
wore
on
it
became
a
grave
question
at
oakland
how
the
two
soldiers
were
to
subsist
they
had
no
provisions
with
them
and
the
roads
were
so
closely
watched
that
there
was
no
chance
of
their
obtaining
any
the
matter
was
talked
over
and
the
boys
mother
and
cousin
belle
were
in
despair
they
can
eat
their
shoes
said
willy
reflectively
the
ladies
exclaimed
in
horror
that
what
men
always
do
when
they
get
lost
in
a
wilderness
where
there
is
no
game
this
piece
of
information
from
willy
did
not
impress
his
hearers
as
much
as
he
supposed
it
would
i
tell
you
let
me
and
frank
go
and
carry
something
to
eat
how
do
you
know
where
they
are
they
are
at
our
robber
cave
are
they
cousin
belle
we
told
the
general
yesterday
how
to
get
there
did
we
yes
and
he
said
last
night
that
he
would
go
there
willy
idea
seemed
a
good
one
and
the
offer
was
accepted
the
boys
were
to
go
out
as
if
to
see
the
troops
and
were
to
take
as
much
food
as
they
thought
could
pass
for
their
luncheon
their
mother
cooked
and
put
up
a
luncheon
large
enough
to
have
satisfied
the
appetites
of
two
young
brobdingnagians
and
they
set
out
on
their
relief
expedition
the
two
sturdy
little
figures
looked
full
of
importance
as
they
strode
off
up
the
road
they
carried
many
loving
messages
their
cousin
belle
gave
to
each
separately
a
long
whispered
message
which
each
by
himself
was
to
deliver
to
the
general
it
was
thought
best
not
to
hazard
a
note
they
were
watched
by
the
ladies
from
the
portico
until
they
disappeared
over
the
hill
they
took
a
path
which
led
into
the
woods
and
walked
cautiously
for
fear
some
of
the
raiders
might
be
lurking
about
however
the
boys
saw
none
of
the
enemy
and
in
a
little
while
they
came
to
a
point
where
the
pines
began
then
they
turned
into
the
woods
for
the
pines
were
so
thick
the
boys
could
not
be
seen
and
the
pine
tags
made
it
so
soft
under
foot
that
they
could
walk
without
making
any
noise
they
were
pushing
their
way
through
the
bushes
when
frank
suddenly
stopped
hush
he
said
willy
halted
and
listened
there
they
are
from
a
little
distance
to
one
side
in
the
direction
of
the
path
they
had
just
left
they
heard
the
trampling
of
a
number
of
horses
feet
that
not
our
men
said
willy
hugh
and
the
general
have
any
horses
no
that
the
yankees
said
frank
let
lie
down
they
may
hear
us
the
boys
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
and
almost
held
their
breath
until
the
horses
had
passed
out
of
hearing
do
you
reckon
they
are
hunting
for
us
asked
willy
in
an
awed
whisper
no
for
hugh
and
the
general
come
on
they
rose
went
tipping
a
little
deeper
into
the
pines
and
again
made
their
way
toward
the
cave
maybe
they
caught
suggested
willy
they
ca
catch
in
these
pines
replied
frank
you
ca
see
any
distance
at
all
a
horse
ca
get
through
and
the
general
and
hugh
could
shoot
and
then
get
away
before
they
could
catch
they
hurried
on
frank
suppose
they
take
us
for
yankees
evidently
willy
mind
had
been
busy
since
frank
last
speech
they
are
going
to
shoot
said
frank
but
it
was
an
unpleasant
suggestion
for
they
were
not
very
far
from
the
dense
clump
of
pines
between
two
gullies
which
the
boys
called
their
cave
we
can
whistle
he
said
presently
wo
hugh
and
the
general
think
we
are
enemies
trying
to
surround
them
willy
objected
the
dilemma
was
a
serious
one
we
have
to
crawl
up
said
frank
after
a
pause
and
this
was
agreed
upon
they
were
soon
on
the
edge
of
the
deep
gully
which
on
one
side
protected
the
spot
from
all
approach
they
scrambled
down
its
steep
side
and
began
to
creep
along
peeping
over
its
other
edge
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
they
could
discover
the
clearing
which
marked
the
little
green
spot
on
top
of
the
hill
where
once
had
stood
an
old
cabin
the
base
of
the
ruined
chimney
with
its
immense
constituted
the
boys
cave
they
were
close
to
it
now
and
felt
themselves
to
be
in
imminent
danger
of
a
sweeping
fusillade
they
had
just
crept
up
to
the
top
of
the
ravine
and
were
consulting
when
some
one
immediately
behind
them
not
twenty
feet
away
called
out
hello
what
are
you
boys
doing
here
are
you
trying
to
capture
us
they
jumped
at
the
unexpected
voice
the
general
broke
into
a
laugh
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
ground
on
the
other
side
of
the
declivity
and
had
been
watching
their
manoeuvres
for
some
time
he
brought
them
to
the
where
hugh
was
asleep
on
the
ground
he
had
been
on
watch
all
the
morning
and
during
the
general
turn
was
making
up
for
his
lost
sleep
he
was
soon
wide
awake
enough
and
he
and
the
general
with
appetites
bearing
witness
to
their
long
fast
were
without
delay
engaged
in
disposing
of
the
provisions
which
the
boys
had
brought
the
boys
were
delighted
with
the
mystery
of
their
surroundings
each
in
turn
took
the
general
aside
and
held
a
long
interview
with
him
and
gave
him
all
their
cousin
belle
messages
no
one
had
ever
treated
them
with
such
consideration
as
the
general
showed
them
the
two
men
asked
the
boys
all
about
the
dispositions
of
the
enemy
but
the
boys
had
little
to
tell
they
are
after
us
pretty
hotly
said
the
general
i
think
they
are
going
away
shortly
it
nothing
but
a
raid
and
they
are
moving
on
we
must
get
back
to
camp
how
are
you
going
asked
the
boys
you
have
any
horses
we
are
going
to
get
some
of
their
horses
said
the
officer
they
have
taken
ours
now
they
must
furnish
us
with
others
it
was
about
time
for
the
boys
to
start
for
home
the
general
took
each
of
them
aside
and
talked
for
a
long
time
he
was
speaking
to
willy
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
when
there
was
a
crack
of
a
twig
in
the
pines
in
a
second
he
had
laid
the
boy
on
his
back
in
the
soft
grass
and
whipped
out
a
pistol
then
with
a
low
quick
call
to
hugh
he
sprang
swiftly
into
the
pines
toward
the
sound
crawl
down
into
the
ravine
boys
called
hugh
following
his
companion
the
boys
rolled
down
over
the
bank
like
little
but
in
a
second
they
heard
a
familiar
drawling
voice
call
out
in
a
subdued
tone
hold
on
cunnel
it
nobody
but
me
do
you
know
me
and
in
a
moment
they
heard
the
general
astonished
and
somewhat
stern
reply
mills
what
are
you
doing
here
who
with
you
what
do
you
want
well
said
the
slowly
i
i
come
to
see
if
i
could
be
o
any
use
to
you
i
heard
the
yankees
had
run
you
from
oakland
last
night
and
was
sort
o
huntin
for
you
fact
is
been
up
my
way
and
i
sort
o
i
come
an
see
ef
i
could
help
you
git
back
to
camp
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
i
wonder
you
are
not
ashamed
to
look
me
in
the
face
the
general
voice
was
still
stern
he
had
turned
around
and
walked
back
to
the
cleared
space
the
deserter
scratched
his
head
in
perplexity
i
needn
come
he
said
doggedly
where
them
boys
i
want
the
boys
hurted
i
seen
comin
here
an
i
jes
followed
to
see
they
did
get
in
no
trouble
but
this
speech
about
the
boys
effected
what
the
offer
of
personal
service
to
the
general
himself
had
failed
to
bring
about
sit
down
and
let
me
talk
to
you
said
the
general
throwing
himself
on
the
grass
mills
seated
himself
near
the
officer
with
his
gun
across
his
knees
and
began
to
bite
a
straw
which
he
pulled
from
a
tuft
by
his
side
the
boys
had
come
up
out
of
their
retreat
and
taken
places
on
each
side
of
the
general
you
all
take
to
grass
like
young
partridges
said
the
hunter
the
boys
were
flattered
for
they
considered
any
notice
from
him
a
compliment
what
made
you
fool
us
and
send
us
to
catch
that
frank
asked
well
you
ketched
him
did
you
you
the
only
ones
ever
been
able
to
ketch
him
he
said
with
a
low
chuckle
now
mills
you
know
how
things
stand
said
the
general
it
a
shame
for
you
to
have
been
acting
this
way
you
know
what
people
say
about
you
but
if
you
come
back
to
camp
and
do
your
duty
i
have
it
all
straightened
out
if
you
do
i
have
you
shot
his
voice
was
as
calm
and
his
manner
as
composed
as
if
he
were
promising
the
man
opposite
him
a
reward
for
good
conduct
he
looked
mills
steadily
in
the
eyes
all
the
time
the
boys
felt
as
if
their
friend
were
about
to
be
executed
the
general
seemed
an
immeasurable
distance
above
them
the
deserter
blinked
twice
or
thrice
slowly
bit
his
shred
of
straw
looked
casually
first
toward
one
boy
and
then
toward
the
other
but
without
the
slightest
change
of
expression
in
his
face
he
said
at
length
i
ai

deserter

feared
of
bein
shot

away

he
rose
to
his
feet
in
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
and
his
eyes
usually
so
dull
were
like
live
coals
the
general
looked
at
him
quietly
a
few
seconds
then
himself
arose
and
laid
his
hand
on
tim
mills
shoulder
all
right
he
said
i
got
a
little
snack

he
turned
away
as
if
relieved
the
boys
said
to
all
three
and
started
in
the
direction
of
home
chapter
xvi
after
crossing
the
gully
and
walking
on
through
the
woods
for
what
they
thought
a
safe
distance
they
turned
into
the
path
they
were
talking
very
merrily
about
the
general
and
hugh
and
their
friend
mills
and
were
discussing
some
romantic
plan
for
the
recapture
of
their
horses
from
the
enemy
when
they
came
out
of
the
path
into
the
road
and
found
themselves
within
twenty
yards
of
a
group
of
federal
soldiers
quietly
sitting
on
their
horses
evidently
guarding
the
road
the
sight
of
the
made
the
boys
jump
they
would
have
crept
back
but
it
was
too
late
they
caught
the
eye
of
the
man
nearest
them
they
ceased
talking
as
suddenly
as
birds
in
the
trees
stop
chirruping
when
the
hawk
sails
over
and
when
one
yankee
called
to
them
in
a
stern
tone
halt
there
and
started
to
come
toward
them
their
hearts
were
in
their
mouths
where
are
you
boys
going
he
asked
as
he
came
up
to
them
going
home
where
do
you
belong
over
there
at
oakland
pointing
in
the
direction
of
their
home
which
seemed
suddenly
to
have
moved
a
thousand
miles
aways
where
have
you
been
the
other
soldiers
had
come
up
now
been
down
this
way
the
boys
voices
were
never
so
meek
before
each
reply
was
like
an
apology
been
to
see
your
brother
asked
one
who
had
not
spoken
before
a
fellow
the
boys
looked
at
him
they
were
paralyzed
by
dread
of
the
approaching
question
now
boys
we
know
where
you
have
been
said
a
small
fellow
who
wore
a
yellow
chevron
on
his
arm
he
had
a
thin
moustache
and
a
sharp
nose
and
rode
a
wiry
dull
sorrel
horse
you
may
just
as
well
tell
us
all
about
it
we
know
you
been
to
see
and
we
are
going
to
make
you
carry
us

said
frank
doggedly
willy
expressed
his
determination
also
if
you
do
it
going
to
be
pretty
bad
for
you
said
the
little
corporal
he
gave
an
order
to
two
of
the
men
who
sprang
from
their
horses
and
catching
frank
swung
him
up
behind
another
cavalryman
the
boy
face
was
very
pale
but
he
bit
his
lip
go
ahead
continued
the
corporal
to
a
number
of
his
men
who
started
down
the
path
you
four
men
remain
here
till
we
come
back
he
said
to
the
men
on
the
ground
and
to
two
others
on
horseback
keep
him
here
jerking
his
thumb
toward
willy
whose
face
was
already
burning
with
emotion
i
going
with
frank
said
willy

me
go
this
to
the
man
who
had
hold
of
him
by
the
arm
frank
make
him
let
me
go
he
shouted
bursting
into
tears
and
turning
on
his
captor
with
all
his
little
might
willy
he
not
goin
to
hurt
you
do
you
tell
called
frank
squirming
until
he
dug
his
heels
so
into
the
horse
flanks
that
the
horse
began
to
kick
up
keep
quiet
johnny
he
not
goin
to
hurt
him
said
one
of
the
men
kindly
he
had
a
brown
beard
and
shining
white
teeth
they
rode
slowly
down
the
narrow
path
the
dragoon
holding
frank
by
the
leg
deep
down
in
the
woods
beyond
a
small
branch
the
path
forked
which
way
asked
the
corporal
stopping
and
addressing
frank
frank
set
his
mouth
tight
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
which
is
it
the
corporal
repeated
i
ai
going
to
tell
said
he
firmly
look
here

got
you
and

are
going
to
make
you

might
just
as
well

if

we
to
make
you
the
boy
said
nothing
illustration
the
boy
faced
his
captor
who
held
a
strap
in
one
hand
you
men
dismount
stubbs
hold
the
horses
he
himself
dismounted
and
three
others
did
the
same
giving
their
horses
to
a
fourth
get
down
this
to
frank
and
the
soldier
behind
whom
he
was
riding
the
soldier
dismounted
and
the
boy
slipped
off
after
him
and
faced
his
captor
who
held
a
strap
in
one
hand
are
you
goin
to
tell
us
he
asked
no
do
you
know
he
came
a
step
nearer
and
held
the
strap
forward
there
was
a
long
silence
the
boy
face
paled
perceptibly
but
took
on
a
look
as
if
the
proceedings
were
indifferent
to
him
if
you
say
you
do
know
said
the
man
hesitating
in
face
of
the
boy
resolution
do
you
know
where
they
are
yes
i
know
but
i
ai
goin
to
tell
you
said
frank
bursting
into
tears
the
little
johnny
game
said
the
soldier
who
had
told
him
the
others
were
not
going
to
hurt
willy
the
corporal
said
something
to
this
man
in
an
undertone
to
which
he
replied
you
can
try
but
it
is
going
to
do
any
good
i
do
half
like
it
anyway
frank
had
stopped
crying
after
his
first
outburst
if
you
do
tell
we
are
going
to
shoot
you
said
the
little
soldier
drawing
his
pistol
the
boy
shut
his
mouth
close
and
looked
straight
at
the
corporal
the
man
laid
down
his
pistol
and
seizing
frank
drew
his
hands
behind
him
and
tied
them
get
ready
men
he
said
as
he
drew
the
boy
aside
to
a
small
tree
putting
him
with
his
back
to
it
frank
thought
his
hour
had
come
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
willy
and
wondered
if
the
soldiers
would
shoot
willy
too
his
face
twitched
and
grew
ghastly
white
then
he
thought
of
his
father
and
of
how
proud
he
would
be
of
his
son
bravery
when
he
should
hear
of
it
this
gave
him
strength
the
knot
hurts
my
hands
he
said
the
man
leaned
over
and
eased
it
a
little
i
was
crying
because
i
was
scared
said
frank
the
kind
looking
fellow
turned
away
now
boys
get
ready
said
the
corporal
taking
up
his
pistol
how
large
it
looked
to
frank
he
wondered
where
the
bullets
would
hit
him
and
if
the
wounds
would
bleed
and
whether
he
would
be
left
alone
all
night
out
there
in
the
woods
and
if
his
mother
would
come
and
kiss
him
i
want
to
say
my
prayers
he
said
faintly
the
soldier
made
some
reply
which
he
could
not
hear
and
the
man
with
the
beard
started
forward
but
just
then
all
grew
dark
before
his
eyes
next
he
thought
he
must
have
been
shot
for
he
felt
wet
about
his
face
and
was
lying
down
he
heard
some
one
say
he
coming
to
and
another
replied
thank
god
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
beside
the
little
branch
with
his
head
in
the
lap
of
the
big
soldier
with
the
beard
and
the
little
corporal
was
leaning
over
him
throwing
water
in
his
face
from
a
cap
the
others
were
standing
around
what
the
matter
asked
frank
that
all
right
said
the
little
corporal
kindly
we
were
just
a
bit
with
you
johnny
we
never
meant
to
hurt
you
said
the
other
you
feel
better
now
yes
where
willy
he
was
too
tired
to
move
he
all
right
we
take
you
to
him
am
i
shot
asked
frank
no
do
you
think
we
have
touched
a
hair
of
your
head
and
you
such
a
brave
little
fellow
we
were
just
trying
to
scare
you
a
bit
and
carried
it
too
far
and
you
got
a
little
faint
that
all
the
voice
was
so
kindly
that
frank
was
encouraged
to
sit
up
can
you
walk
now
asked
the
corporal
helping
him
and
steadying
him
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
take
him
said
the
big
fellow
and
before
the
boy
could
move
he
had
stooped
taken
frank
in
his
arms
and
was
carrying
him
back
toward
the
place
where
they
had
left
willy
while
the
others
followed
after
with
the
horses
i
can
walk
said
frank
no
i
carry
you
your
heart
the
boy
did
not
know
that
the
big
dragoon
was
looking
down
at
the
light
hair
resting
on
his
arm
and
that
while
he
trod
the
virginia
in
fancy
he
was
home
in
delaware
or
that
the
pressure
the
boy
felt
from
his
strong
arms
was
a
caress
given
for
the
sake
of
another
boy
far
away
on
the
brandywine
a
little
while
before
they
came
in
sight
frank
asked
to
be
put
down
the
soldier
gently
set
him
on
his
feet
and
before
he
let
him
go
kissed
him
i
got
a
fellow
at
home
just
the
size
of
you
he
said
softly
frank
saw
that
his
eyes
were
moist
i
hope
you
get
safe
back
to
him
he
said
god
grant
it
said
the
soldier
when
they
reached
the
squad
at
the
gate
they
found
willy
still
in
much
distress
on
frank
account
but
he
wiped
his
eyes
when
his
brother
reappeared
and
listened
with
pride
to
the
soldiers
praise
of
frank
grit
as
they
called
it
when
they
let
the
boys
go
the
little
corporal
wished
frank
to
accept
a
gold
piece
but
he
politely
declined
it
chapter
xvii
the
story
of
frank
adventure
and
courage
was
the
talk
of
all
the
oakland
plantation
his
mother
and
cousin
belle
both
kissed
him
and
called
him
their
little
hero
willy
also
received
a
full
share
of
praise
for
his
courage
about
noon
there
was
great
commotion
among
the
troops
they
were
far
more
numerous
than
they
had
been
in
the
morning
and
instead
of
riding
about
the
woods
in
small
bodies
hunting
for
the
concealed
soldiers
they
were
collecting
together
and
preparing
to
move
it
was
learned
that
a
considerable
body
of
cavalry
was
passing
down
the
road
by
trinity
church
and
that
the
depot
had
been
burnt
again
the
night
before
somehow
a
rumor
got
about
that
the
confederates
were
following
up
the
raiders
in
an
hour
most
of
the
soldiers
went
away
but
a
number
still
stayed
on
their
horses
were
picketed
about
the
yard
feeding
and
they
themselves
lounged
around
making
themselves
at
home
in
the
house
and
pulling
to
pieces
the
things
that
were
left
they
were
not
however
as
wanton
in
their
destruction
as
the
first
set
who
had
passed
by
the
year
before
among
those
who
yet
remained
were
the
little
corporal
and
the
big
young
soldier
who
had
been
so
kind
to
frank
they
were
in
the
at
length
the
last
man
rode
off
the
boys
had
gone
in
and
out
among
them
without
being
molested
now
and
then
some
rough
fellow
would
swear
at
them
but
for
the
most
part
their
intercourse
with
the
boys
was
friendly
when
therefore
they
rode
off
the
boys
were
allowed
by
their
mother
to
go
and
see
the
main
body
peter
and
cole
were
with
them
they
took
the
main
road
and
followed
along
picking
up
straps
and
cartridges
and
all
those
miscellaneous
things
dropped
by
a
large
body
of
troops
as
they
pass
along
cartridges
were
very
valuable
as
they
furnished
the
only
powder
and
shot
the
boys
could
get
for
hunting
and
their
supply
was
out
these
were
found
in
unusual
numbers
the
boys
filled
their
pockets
and
finally
filled
their
sleeves
tying
them
tightly
at
the
wrist
with
strings
so
that
the
contents
would
not
spill
out
one
of
the
boys
found
even
an
old
pistol
which
was
considered
a
great
treasure
he
bore
it
proudly
in
his
belt
and
was
envied
by
all
the
others
it
was
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
when
they
thought
of
turning
toward
home
their
pockets
and
sleeves
bagging
down
with
the
heavy
they
left
the
federal
feeding
their
horses
at
a
great
white
pile
of
corn
which
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
of
a
neighbor
and
was
scattered
all
over
the
ground
they
crossed
a
field
descended
a
hill
and
took
the
main
road
at
its
foot
just
as
a
body
of
cavalry
came
in
sight
a
small
squad
riding
some
little
distance
in
advance
of
the
main
body
had
already
passed
by
these
were
confederates
the
first
man
they
saw
at
the
head
of
the
column
by
the
colonel
was
the
general
and
a
little
behind
him
was
none
other
than
hugh
on
a
gray
roan
while
not
far
down
the
column
rode
their
friend
tim
mills
looking
rusty
and
sleepy
as
usual
goodness
why
here
are
the
general
and
hugh
how
in
the
world
did
you
get
away
exclaimed
the
boys
they
learned
that
it
was
a
column
of
cavalry
following
the
line
of
the
raid
and
that
the
general
and
hugh
had
met
them
and
volunteered
the
soldiers
greeted
the
boys
cordially
the
yankees
are
right
up
there
said
the
youngsters
where
how
many
what
are
they
doing
asked
the
general
a
whole
pack
of
right
up
there
at
the
stables
and
all
about
feeding
their
horses
and
sitting
all
around
and
ever
so
many
more
have
gone
along
down
the
road
fling
the
fence
down
there
the
boys
pitched
down
the
rails
in
two
or
three
places
an
order
was
passed
back
and
in
an
instant
a
stir
of
preparation
was
noticed
all
down
the
line
of
horsemen
a
courier
galloped
up
the
road
to
recall
the
the
head
of
the
column
passed
through
the
gap
and
without
waiting
for
the
others
dashed
up
the
hill
at
a
gallop
the
general
and
the
colonel
a
score
of
yards
ahead
of
any
of
the
others
let
go
and
see
the
fight
cried
the
boys
and
the
whole
set
started
back
up
the
hill
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
they
shoot
wo
they
shoot
us
asked
one
of
the
negro
boys
in
some
apprehension
this
though
before
unthought
of
was
a
possibility
and
for
a
moment
brought
them
down
to
a
slower
pace
we
can
lie
flat
and
peep
over
the
top
of
the
hill
this
was
happy
thought
and
the
party
started
ahead
again
let
go
around
that
way
they
made
a
little
detour
just
before
they
reached
the
crest
they
heard
a
shot
bang
immediately
followed
by
another
bang
and
in
a
second
more
a
regular
volley
began
and
was
kept
up
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
hill
in
time
to
see
the
confederates
gallop
up
the
slope
toward
the
stables
firing
their
pistols
at
the
who
were
forming
in
the
edge
of
a
little
wood
over
beyond
a
fence
from
the
other
side
of
which
the
smoke
of
their
carbines
was
rolling
they
had
evidently
started
on
just
as
the
boys
left
and
before
the
confederates
came
in
sight
the
boys
saw
their
friends
dash
at
this
fence
and
could
distinguish
the
general
and
hugh
who
were
still
in
the
lead
their
horses
took
the
fence
going
over
like
birds
and
others
followed
tim
mills
among
them
while
yet
more
went
through
a
gate
a
few
yards
to
one
side
look
at
hugh
look
at
hugh
look
that
horse
has
fallen
down
cried
one
of
the
boys
as
a
horse
went
down
just
at
the
entrance
of
the
wood
rolling
over
his
rider
he
shot
exclaimed
frank
for
neither
horse
nor
rider
attempted
to
rise
see
they
are
running
the
little
squad
of
were
retiring
into
the
woods
with
the
grays
closely
pressing
them
let
cut
across
and
see
run
over
the
bridge
come
on
all
the
little
group
of
spectators
white
and
black
started
as
hard
as
they
could
go
for
a
path
they
knew
which
led
by
a
short
cut
through
the
little
piece
of
woods
beyond
lay
a
field
divided
by
a
stream
a
short
distance
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
a
large
body
of
woods
the
popping
was
still
going
on
furiously
in
the
woods
and
bullets
were
over
the
fields
but
the
boys
could
not
see
anything
and
they
did
not
think
about
the
flying
balls
they
were
all
excitement
at
the
idea
of
our
men
whipping
the
enemy
and
they
ran
with
all
their
might
to
be
in
time
to
see
them
chase
across
the
field
the
road
on
which
the
skirmish
took
place
and
down
which
the
federal
had
retreated
made
a
sharp
curve
beyond
the
woods
around
the
bend
of
a
little
stream
crossed
by
a
small
bridge
and
the
boys
in
taking
the
short
cut
had
placed
the
road
between
themselves
and
home
but
they
did
not
care
about
that
for
their
men
were
driving
the
others
they
just
wanted
to
see
it
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
field
in
time
to
see
that
the
yankees
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
they
knew
them
to
be
where
puffs
of
smoke
came
out
of
the
opposite
wood
and
the
confederates
had
stopped
beyond
the
bridge
and
were
halted
in
some
confusion
in
the
field
the
firing
was
very
sharp
and
bullets
were
singing
in
every
direction
then
the
confederates
got
together
and
went
as
hard
as
they
could
right
at
them
up
to
the
wood
all
along
the
edge
of
which
the
smoke
was
pouring
in
continuous
puffs
and
with
a
rattle
of
shots
they
saw
several
horses
fall
as
the
confederates
galloped
on
but
the
smoke
hid
most
of
it
next
they
saw
a
long
line
of
fire
appear
in
the
smoke
on
both
sides
of
the
road
where
it
entered
the
wood
then
the
confederates
stopped
and
became
all
mixed
up
a
number
of
horses
galloped
away
without
their
riders
another
line
of
white
and
red
flame
came
out
of
the
woods
the
confederates
began
to
come
back
leaving
many
horses
on
the
ground
and
a
body
of
cavalry
in
blue
coats
poured
out
of
the
wood
in
pursuit
look
look
they
are
running
they
are
beating
our
men
exclaimed
the
boys
they
have
driven
back
across
the
bridge
how
many
of
them
there
are
what
shall
we
do
suppose
they
see
us
come
on
frank
willy
let
go
home
said
the
colored
boys
they
shoot
us
the
fight
was
now
in
the
woods
which
lay
between
the
boys
and
their
home
but
just
then
the
got
together
again
turned
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
dashed
back
on
their
pursuers
and
the
smoke
and
bushes
on
the
stream
hid
everything
in
a
second
more
both
emerged
on
the
other
side
of
the
smoke
and
went
into
the
woods
on
the
further
edge
of
the
field
all
in
confusion
and
leaving
on
the
ground
more
horses
and
men
than
before
what
them
things
my
ears
asked
one
of
the
negro
boys
bullets
said
frank
proud
of
his
knowledge
will
they
hurt
me
if
they
hit
me
illustration
look
look
they
are
running
they
are
beating
our
men
exclaimed
the
boys
of
course
they
will
they
kill
you
i
gwine
home
said
the
boy
and
off
he
started
at
a
trot
hold
on
we
goin
too
but
let
go
down
this
way
this
is
the
best
way
they
went
along
the
edge
of
the
field
toward
the
point
in
the
road
where
the
skirmish
had
been
and
where
the
confederates
had
rallied
they
stopped
to
listen
to
the
popping
in
the
woods
on
the
other
side
and
were
just
saying
how
glad
they
were
that
our
men
had
whipped
them
when
a
soldier
came
along
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
are
you
boys
doing
here
he
asked
we
just
looking
on
an
answered
the
boys
meekly
well
you
better
be
getting
home
as
fast
as
you
can
they
are
too
strong
for
us
and
they
be
driving
us
back
directly
and
some
of
you
may
get
killed
or
run
over
this
was
dreadful
such
an
idea
had
never
occurred
to
the
boys
a
panic
took
possession
of
them
come
on
let
go
home
this
was
the
universal
idea
and
in
a
second
the
whole
party
were
cutting
straight
for
home
utterly
stampeded
they
could
readily
have
found
shelter
and
security
back
over
the
hill
from
the
flying
balls
but
they
preferred
to
get
home
and
they
made
straight
for
it
the
popping
of
the
guns
which
still
kept
up
in
the
woods
across
the
little
river
now
meant
to
them
that
the
victorious
yankees
were
driving
back
their
friends
they
believed
that
the
bullets
which
now
and
then
yet
whistled
over
the
woods
with
a
long
singing
were
aimed
at
them
for
their
lives
then
they
ran
expecting
to
be
killed
every
minute
the
load
of
cartridges
in
their
pockets
which
they
had
carried
for
hours
weighed
them
down
as
they
ran
they
threw
these
out
then
followed
those
in
their
sleeves
frank
and
the
other
boys
easily
got
rid
of
theirs
but
willy
had
tied
the
strings
around
his
wrists
in
such
hard
knots
that
he
could
not
possibly
untie
them
he
was
falling
behind
frank
heard
him
call
without
slacking
his
speed
he
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
willy
face
was
red
and
his
mouth
was
twitching
he
was
sobbing
a
little
and
was
tearing
at
the
strings
with
his
teeth
as
he
ran
then
the
strings
came
loose
one
after
the
other
the
cartridges
were
shaken
out
over
the
ground
and
willy
face
at
once
cleared
up
as
he
ran
forward
lightened
of
his
load
they
had
passed
almost
through
the
narrow
skirt
of
woods
where
the
first
attack
was
made
when
they
heard
some
one
not
far
from
the
side
of
the
road
call
water
the
boys
stopped
what
that
they
asked
each
other
in
a
startled
undertone
a
groan
came
from
the
same
direction
and
a
voice
said
oh
for
some
water
a
short
whispered
consultation
was
held
he
right
up
on
that
bank
there
a
road
up
there
frank
advanced
a
little
a
man
was
lying
somewhat
propped
up
against
a
tree
his
eyes
were
closed
and
there
was
a
ghastly
wound
in
his
head
willy
it
a
yankee
and
he
shot
is
he
dead
asked
the
others
in
awed
voices
no
let
ask
him
if
he
hurt
much
they
all
approached
him
his
eyes
were
shut
and
his
face
was
ashy
white
willy

yankee
exclaimed
frank
the
wounded
man
moved
his
hand
at
the
sound
of
the
voices

he
murmured

water
for
pity
sake

get
you
some
do

know
me

me
have
your
canteen
said
frank
stooping
and
taking
hold
of
the
canteen
it
was
held
by
its
strap
but
the
boy
whipped
out
a
knife
and
cut
it
loose
the
man
tried
to
speak
but
the
boys
could
not
understand
him
where
are
you
goin
get
it
frank
asked
the
other
boys
at
the
branch
down
there
that
runs
into
the
creek

yankees

there
objected
peter
and
willy

cole
the
soldier
groaned

frank
said
willy
who
could
not
stand
the
sight
of
the
man
suffering
we
be
back
directly
the
two
boys
darted
off
the
others
following
them
at
a
little
distance
they
reached
the
open
field
the
shooting
was
still
going
on
in
the
woods
on
the
other
side
but
they
no
longer
thought
of
it
they
ran
down
the
hill
and
dashed
across
the
little
flat
to
the
branch
at
the
nearest
point
washed
the
blood
from
the
canteen
and
filled
it
with
the
cool
water
i
wish
we
had
something
to
wash
his
face
with
sighed
willy
but
i
have
got
a
handkerchief
neither
have
i
willy
looked
thoughtful
a
second
more
and
he
had
stripped
off
his
light
sailor
jacket
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
the
next
minute
the
two
boys
were
running
up
the
hill
again
when
they
reached
the
spot
where
the
wounded
man
lay
he
had
slipped
down
and
was
flat
on
the
ground
his
feeble
voice
still
called
for
water
but
was
much
weaker
than
before
frank
stooped
and
held
the
canteen
to
the
man
lips
and
he
drank
then
willy
and
frank
together
bathed
his
face
with
the
still
dripping
cotton
jacket
this
revived
him
somewhat
but
he
did
not
recognize
them
and
talked
incoherently
they
propped
up
his
head
frank
it
getting
mighty
late
and
we
got
to
go
home
said
willy
the
boys
voice
or
words
reached
the
ears
of
the
wounded
man
take
me
home
he
murmured
i
want
some
water
from
the
well
by
the
dairy
give
him
some
more
water
willy
lifted
the
canteen
here
it
is
the
soldier
swallowed
with
difficulty
he
could
not
raise
his
hand
now
there
was
a
pause
the
boys
stood
around
looking
down
on
him
i
come
back
home
he
said
his
eyes
were
closed
he
dreaming
whispered
willy
did
you
ever
see
anybody
die
asked
frank
in
a
low
tone
willy
face
paled
no
frank
let
go
home
and
tell
somebody
frank
stooped
and
touched
the
soldier
face
he
was
talking
all
the
time
now
though
they
could
not
understand
everything
he
said
the
boy
touch
seemed
to
rouse
him
it
bedtime
he
said
presently
kneel
down
and
say
your
prayers
for
father
willy
let
say
our
prayers
for
him
whispered
frank
i
can
say
i
lay
me
but
before
he
could
begin
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
said
the
soldier
tenderly
the
boys
followed
him
thinking
he
had
heard
them
they
did
not
know
that
he
was
saying
for
one
whom
but
that
morning
he
had
called
his
at
home
the
prayer
that
is
common
to
virginia
and
to
delaware
to
north
and
to
south
and
which
no
wars
can
silence
and
no
victories
cause
to
be
forgotten
the
soldier
voice
now
was
growing
almost
inaudible
he
spoke
between
breaths
i
should
die
before
i
wake
i
should
die
before
i
wake
they
repeated
and
continued
the
prayer
this
i
ask
for
jesus
sake
said
the
boys
ending
there
was
a
long
pause
frank
stroked
the
pale
face
softly
with
his
hands
this
i
ask
for
jesus
sake
whispered
the
lips
then
very
softly
kiss
me
kiss
him
frank
the
boy
stooped
over
and
kissed
the
lips
that
had
kissed
him
in
the
morning
willy
kissed
him
also
the
lips
moved
in
a
faint
smile
god
bless
the
boys
waited
but
that
was
all
the
dusk
settled
down
in
the
woods
the
prayer
was
ended
he
dead
said
frank
in
deep
awe
frank
are
you
mighty
sorry
asked
willy
in
a
trembling
voice
then
he
suddenly
broke
out
crying
i
do
want
him
to
die
i
do
want
him
to
die
chapter
xviii
when
the
boys
reached
home
it
was
they
found
their
mother
very
anxious
about
them
they
gave
an
account
of
the
battle
as
they
called
it
telling
all
about
the
charge
in
which
by
their
statement
the
general
and
hugh
did
wonderful
deeds
their
mother
and
cousin
belle
sat
and
listened
with
tightly
folded
hands
and
blanched
faces
then
they
told
how
they
found
the
wounded
yankee
soldier
on
the
bank
and
about
his
death
they
were
startled
by
seeing
their
cousin
belle
suddenly
fall
on
her
knees
and
throw
herself
across
their
mother
lap
in
a
passion
of
tears
their
mother
put
her
arms
around
the
young
girl
kissed
and
soothed
her
early
the
next
morning
their
mother
had
an
the
only
vehicle
left
on
the
place
sent
down
to
the
spot
to
bring
the
body
of
the
soldier
up
to
oakland
so
that
it
might
be
buried
in
the
there
carpenter
william
made
the
coffin
and
several
men
were
set
to
work
to
dig
the
grave
in
the
garden
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
cart
came
back
a
sheet
covered
the
body
the
little
cortege
was
a
very
solemn
one
the
steers
pulling
slowly
up
the
hill
and
a
man
walking
on
each
side
then
the
body
was
put
into
the
coffin
and
reverently
carried
to
the
grave
the
boys
mother
read
the
burial
service
out
of
the
and
afterward
uncle
william
slow
offered
a
prayer
just
as
they
were
about
to
turn
away
the
boys
mother
began
to
sing
abide
with
me
fast
falls
the
eventide
she
and
cousin
belle
and
the
boys
sang
the
hymn
together
and
then
all
walked
sadly
away
leaving
the
fresh
mound
in
the
garden
where
birds
peeped
curiously
from
the
at
the
soldier
grave
in
the
warm
light
of
the
afternoon
sun
a
small
packet
of
letters
and
a
gold
watch
and
chain
found
in
the
soldier
pocket
were
sealed
up
by
the
boys
mother
and
put
in
her
bureau
drawer
for
they
could
not
then
be
sent
through
the
lines
there
was
one
letter
however
which
they
buried
with
him
it
contained
two
locks
of
hair
one
gray
the
other
brown
and
curly
the
next
few
months
brought
no
new
incidents
but
the
following
year
deep
gloom
fell
upon
oakland
it
was
not
only
that
the
times
were
harder
than
they
had
ever
been
though
the
plantation
was
now
utterly
destitute
there
were
no
provisions
and
no
crops
for
there
were
no
teams
it
was
not
merely
that
a
shadow
was
settling
down
on
all
the
land
for
the
boys
did
not
trouble
themselves
about
these
things
though
such
anxieties
were
bringing
gray
hairs
to
their
temples
the
general
had
been
wounded
and
captured
during
a
cavalry
fight
the
boys
somehow
connected
their
cousin
belle
with
the
general
capture
and
looked
on
her
with
some
disfavor
she
and
the
general
had
quarrelled
a
short
time
before
and
it
was
known
that
she
had
returned
his
ring
when
therefore
he
was
shot
through
the
body
and
taken
by
the
enemy
the
boys
could
not
admit
that
their
cousin
had
any
right
to
stay
in
her
own
room
weeping
about
it
they
felt
that
it
was
all
her
own
fault
and
they
told
her
so
whereupon
she
simply
burst
out
crying
and
ran
from
the
room
the
hard
times
grew
harder
the
shadow
deepened
hugh
was
wounded
and
captured
in
a
charge
at
petersburg
and
it
was
not
known
whether
he
was
badly
hurt
or
not
then
came
the
news
that
richmond
had
been
evacuated
the
boys
knew
that
this
was
a
defeat
but
even
then
they
did
not
believe
that
the
confederates
were
beaten
their
mother
was
deeply
affected
by
the
news
that
night
at
least
a
dozen
of
the
negroes
disappeared
the
other
servants
said
the
missing
ones
had
gone
to
richmond
to
get
their
papers
a
week
or
so
later
the
boys
heard
the
rumor
that
general
lee
had
surrendered
at
a
place
called
appomattox
when
they
came
home
and
told
their
mother
what
they
had
heard
she
turned
as
pale
as
death
arose
and
went
into
her
chamber
the
news
was
corroborated
next
day
during
the
following
two
days
every
negro
on
the
plantation
left
excepting
lame
old
sukey
brown
some
of
them
came
and
said
they
had
to
go
to
richmond
that
the
word
had
come
for
them
others
including
even
uncle
balla
and
lucy
ann
slipped
away
by
night
after
that
their
mother
had
to
cook
and
the
boys
milked
and
did
the
heavier
work
the
cooking
was
not
much
trouble
however
for
pease
were
about
all
they
had
to
eat
one
afternoon
the
second
day
after
the
news
of
lee
surrender
the
boys
who
had
gone
to
drive
up
the
cows
to
be
milked
saw
two
horsemen
one
behind
the
other
coming
slowly
down
the
road
on
the
far
hill
the
front
horse
was
white
and
as
their
father
rode
a
white
horse
they
ran
toward
the
house
to
carry
the
news
their
mother
and
cousin
belle
however
having
seen
the
horsemen
were
waiting
on
the
porch
as
the
men
came
through
the
middle
gate
and
rode
across
the
field
it
was
their
father
and
his
ralph
who
had
been
with
him
all
through
the
war
they
came
slowly
up
the
hill
the
horses
limping
and
fagged
the
riders
dusty
and
drooping
it
seemed
like
a
funeral
the
boys
were
near
the
steps
and
their
mother
stood
on
the
portico
with
her
forehead
resting
against
a
pillar
no
word
was
spoken
into
the
yard
they
rode
at
a
walk
and
up
to
the
porch
then
their
father
who
had
not
once
looked
up
put
both
hands
to
his
face
slipped
from
his
horse
and
walked
up
the
steps
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
and
took
their
mother
into
his
arms
it
a
funeral
the
confederacy
was
dead
a
little
later
their
father
who
had
been
in
the
house
came
out
on
the
porch
near
where
ralph
still
stood
holding
the
horses
take
off
the
saddles
ralph
and
turn
the
horses
out
he
said
ralph
did
so
here
here
my
last
dollar
you
have
been
a
faithful
servant
to
me
put
the
saddles
on
the
porch
it
was
done
you
are
free
he
said
to
the
black
and
then
he
walked
back
into
the
house
ralph
stood
where
he
was
for
some
minutes
without
moving
a
muscle
his
eyes
blinked
mechanically
then
he
looked
at
the
door
and
at
the
windows
above
him
suddenly
he
seemed
to
come
to
himself
turning
slowly
he
walked
solemnly
out
of
the
yard
chapter
xix
the
boys
uncle
william
came
the
next
day
the
two
weeks
which
followed
were
the
hardest
the
boys
had
ever
known
as
yet
nothing
had
been
heard
of
hugh
or
the
general
though
the
boys
father
went
to
richmond
to
see
whether
they
had
been
released
the
family
lived
on
and
pease
there
was
not
a
mouthful
of
meat
on
the
plantation
a
few
aged
animals
were
all
that
remained
on
the
place
the
boys
mother
bought
a
little
sugar
and
made
some
cakes
and
the
boys
day
after
day
carried
them
over
to
the
depot
and
left
them
with
a
man
there
to
be
sold
such
a
thing
had
never
been
known
before
in
the
history
of
the
family
a
company
of
yankees
were
camped
very
near
but
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
boys
they
bought
the
cakes
and
paid
for
them
in
greenbacks
which
were
the
first
new
money
they
had
at
oakland
one
day
the
boys
were
walking
along
the
road
coming
back
from
the
camp
when
they
met
a
little
old
wagon
driven
by
a
man
who
lived
near
the
depot
in
it
were
a
boy
about
willy
size
and
an
old
lady
with
white
hair
both
in
deep
mourning
the
boy
was
better
dressed
than
any
boy
they
had
ever
seen
they
were
strangers
the
boys
touched
their
limp
little
hats
to
the
lady
and
felt
somewhat
ashamed
of
their
own
patched
clothes
in
the
presence
of
the
stranger
frank
and
willy
passed
on
they
happened
to
look
back
the
wagon
stopped
just
then
and
the
lady
called
them
little
boys
they
halted
and
returned
we
are
looking
for
my
son
and
this
gentleman
tells
me
that
you
live
about
here
and
know
more
of
the
country
than
any
one
else
i
may
meet
do
you
know
where
any
graves
is
yankee
graves
asked
the
driver
cutting
matters
short
yes
there
are
several
down
on
the
road
by
pigeon
hill
where
the
battle
was
and
two
or
three
by
the
creek
down
yonder
and
there
one
in
our
garden
where
was
your
son
killed
do
you
know
that
he
was
killed
asked
the
driver
i
do
not
know
we
fear
that
he
was
but
of
course
we
still
hope
there
may
have
been
some
mistake
the
last
seen
of
him
was
when
general
sheridan
went
through
this
country
last
year
he
was
with
his
company
in
the
and
was
wounded
and
left
on
the
field
we
hoped
he
might
have
been
found
in
one
of
the
prisons
but
there
is
no
trace
of
him
and
we
fear
illustration
the
boys
sell
their
cakes
to
the
yankees
she
broke
down
and
began
to
cry
he
was
my
only
son
she
sobbed
my
only
son
and
i
gave
him
up
for
the
union
and
she
could
say
no
more
her
distress
affected
the
boys
deeply
if
i
could
but
find
his
grave
even
that
would
be
better
than
this
agonizing
suspense
what
was
your
son
name
asked
the
boys
gently
she
told
them
why
that
our
soldier
exclaimed
both
boys
do
you
know
him
she
asked
eagerly
is
is
her
voice
refused
to
frame
the
fearful
question
yes
in
our
garden
said
the
boys
almost
inaudibly
the
mother
bent
her
head
over
on
her
grandson
shoulder
and
wept
aloud
awful
as
the
suspense
had
been
now
that
the
last
hope
was
removed
the
shock
was
terrible
she
gave
a
stifled
cry
then
wept
with
uncontrollable
grief
the
boys
with
pale
faces
and
eyes
moist
with
sympathy
turned
away
their
heads
and
stood
silent
at
length
she
grew
calmer
wo
you
come
home
with
us
our
father
and
mother
will
be
so
glad
to
have
you
they
said
hospitably
after
questioning
them
a
little
further
she
decided
to
go
the
boys
climbed
into
the
back
of
the
wagon
as
they
went
along
the
boys
told
her
all
about
her
son
his
carrying
frank
their
finding
him
wounded
near
the
road
and
about
his
death
and
burial
he
was
a
real
brave
soldier
they
told
her
consolingly
as
they
approached
the
house
she
asked
whether
they
could
give
her
grandson
something
to
eat
oh
yes
indeed
certainly
they
answered
then
thinking
perhaps
they
were
raising
her
hopes
too
high
they
exclaimed
apologetically
we
have
got
much
we
did
kill
any
squirrels
this
morning
both
our
guns
are
broken
and
do
shoot
very
well
now
she
was
much
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
the
place
which
looked
very
beautiful
among
the
trees
oh
yes
they
big
folks
said
the
driver
she
would
have
waited
at
the
gate
when
they
reached
the
house
but
the
boys
insisted
that
they
all
should
come
in
at
once
one
of
them
ran
forward
and
meeting
his
mother
just
coming
out
to
the
porch
told
who
the
visitor
was
their
mother
instantly
came
down
the
steps
and
walked
toward
the
gate
the
women
met
face
to
face
there
was
no
introduction
none
was
needed
my
son
faltered
the
elder
lady
her
strength
giving
out
the
boys
mother
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
i
have
one
too
god
alone
knows
where
he
is
she
sobbed
each
knew
how
great
was
the
other
loss
and
in
sympathy
with
another
grief
found
consolation
for
her
own
chapter
xx
the
visitors
remained
at
oakland
for
several
days
as
the
lady
wished
to
have
her
son
remains
removed
to
the
old
homestead
in
delaware
she
was
greatly
distressed
over
the
want
which
she
saw
at
oakland
for
there
was
literally
nothing
to
eat
but
pease
and
the
chickens
every
incident
of
the
war
interested
her
she
was
delighted
with
their
cousin
belle
and
took
much
interest
in
her
story
which
was
told
by
the
boys
mother
her
grandson
dupont
was
a
fine
brave
and
generous
young
fellow
he
had
spent
his
boyhood
near
a
town
and
could
neither
ride
swim
nor
shoot
as
the
oakland
boys
did
but
he
was
never
afraid
to
try
anything
and
the
boys
took
a
great
liking
to
him
and
he
to
them
when
the
young
soldier
body
had
been
removed
the
visitors
left
not
however
until
the
boys
had
made
their
companion
promise
to
pay
them
a
visit
after
the
departure
of
these
friends
they
were
much
missed
but
the
next
day
there
was
a
great
rejoicing
at
oakland
every
one
was
in
the
at
dinner
and
the
boys
father
had
just
risen
from
the
table
and
walked
out
of
the
room
a
second
later
they
heard
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
from
him
and
he
called
eagerly
to
his
wife
come
here
quickly
and
ran
down
the
steps
every
one
rose
and
ran
out
hugh
and
the
general
were
just
entering
the
yard
they
were
pale
and
thin
and
looked
ill
but
all
the
past
was
forgotten
in
the
greeting
the
boys
soon
knew
that
the
general
was
making
his
peace
with
their
cousin
belle
who
looked
prettier
than
ever
it
required
several
long
walks
before
all
was
made
right
but
there
was
no
disposition
toward
severity
on
either
side
it
was
determined
that
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
very
soon
the
boys
father
suggested
as
an
objection
to
an
immediate
wedding
that
since
the
general
was
just
half
his
usual
size
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
he
should
regain
his
former
proportions
so
that
all
of
him
might
be
married
but
the
general
would
not
accept
the
proposition
for
delay
and
cousin
belle
finally
consented
to
be
married
at
once
the
old
place
was
in
a
great
stir
over
the
preparations
a
number
of
the
old
servants
including
uncle
balla
and
lucy
ann
had
one
by
one
come
back
to
their
old
home
the
trunks
in
the
garret
were
ransacked
once
more
and
enough
was
found
to
make
up
a
wedding
trousseau
of
two
dresses
hugh
was
to
be
the
general
best
man
and
the
boys
were
to
be
the
ushers
the
only
difficulty
was
that
their
patched
clothes
made
them
feel
a
little
abashed
at
the
prominent
roles
they
were
to
assume
however
their
mother
made
them
each
a
nice
jacket
from
a
striped
dress
one
of
her
only
two
dresses
and
she
adorned
them
with
the
military
brass
buttons
their
father
had
had
taken
from
his
coat
so
they
felt
very
proud
their
father
of
course
was
to
give
the
bride
away
an
office
he
accepted
with
pleasure
he
said
provided
he
did
not
have
to
move
too
far
which
might
be
hazardous
so
long
as
he
had
to
wear
his
spurs
to
keep
the
soles
on
his
boots
thus
even
amid
the
ruins
the
boys
found
life
joyous
and
if
they
were
without
everything
else
they
had
life
health
and
hope
the
old
guns
were
broken
and
they
had
to
ride
in
the
but
they
hoped
to
have
others
and
to
do
better
some
day
the
some
day
came
sooner
than
they
expected
the
morning
before
the
wedding
word
came
that
there
were
at
the
railroad
station
several
boxes
for
their
mother
the
was
sent
for
them
when
the
boxes
arrived
that
evening
there
was
a
letter
from
their
friend
in
delaware
congratulating
cousin
belle
and
apologizing
for
having
sent
a
few
things
to
her
southern
friends
illustration
some
of
the
servants
came
back
to
their
old
home
the
few
things
consisted
not
only
of
necessaries
but
of
everything
which
good
taste
could
suggest
there
was
a
complete
trousseau
for
cousin
belle
and
clothes
for
each
member
of
the
family
the
boys
had
new
suits
of
fine
cloth
with
shirts
and
underclothes
in
plenty
but
the
best
surprise
of
all
was
found
when
they
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
biggest
box
and
found
two
long
narrow
cases
marked
for
the
oakland
boys
these
cases
held
beautiful
new
guns
of
the
finest
make
there
was
a
large
supply
of
ammunition
and
in
each
case
there
was
a
letter
from
dupont
promising
to
come
and
spend
his
vacation
with
them
and
sending
his
love
and
good
wishes
and
thanks
to
his
friends
