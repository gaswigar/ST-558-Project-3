preface
this

contains
the
record

a
few
of
the
many
happy
days
and
novel
experiences
which
i
have
had
in
the
wilds
for
more
than
twenty
years
it
has
been
my
good
fortune
to
live
most
of
the
time
with
nature
on
the
mountains
of
the
west
i
have
made
scores
of
long
exploring
rambles
over
the
mountains
in
every
season
of
the
year
a
charmed
with
the
birds
and
the
trees
on
my
later
excursions
i
have
gone
alone
and
without
firearms
during
three
succeeding
winters
in
which
i
was
a
government
experiment
officer
and
called
the
state
snow
observer
i
scaled
many
of
the
higher
peaks
of
the
rockies
and
made
many

where
are
you
going
was
the
question
asked
me
one
snowy
winter
day
after
hearing
that
i
was
off
on
a
to
be
gone
several
days
and
that
the
place
where
i
intended
to
camp
was
in
deep
snow
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
rockies
the
questioners
laughed
heartily
knowing
me
some
questioners
realized
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
all
that
they
could
say
in
the
nature
of
argument
or
appeal
was
said
to
cause
me
to
forego
the
folly
but
i
went
and
in
the
romance
of
a
new
world
on
the
rockies
in
winter
i
lived
intensely
through
ten
strong
days
and
nights
and
gave
to
my
life
new
and
rare
experiences
afterwards
i
made
other
winter
excursions
all
of
which
were
stirring
and
satisfactory
the
recollection
of
these
winter
experiences
is
as
complete
and
exhilarating
as
any
in
the
vista
of
my
memory
some
years
after
my
first
winter
i
found
myself
holding
a
strange
position
that
of
the
state
snow
observer
of
colorado
i
have
never
heard
of
another
position
like
it
professor
carpenter
the
celebrated
irrigation
engineer
was
making
some
original
investigations
concerning
forests
and
the
he
persuaded
me
to
take
the
position
and
under
his
direction
i
worked
as
a
government
experiment
officer
for
three
successive
winters
i
traversed
the
upper
slopes
of
the
rockies
and
explored
the
crest
of
the
continent
alone
while
on
this
work
i
was
instructed
to
make
notes
on
those
things
that
are
likely
to
be
of
interest
or
value
to
the
department
of
agriculture
or
the
weather
bureau
and
to
be
careful
not
to
lose
my
life
on
these
winter
trips
i
carried
with
me
a
camera
thermometer
barometer
compass
notebook
and
folding
axe
the
food
carried
usually
was
only
raisins
i
left
all
bedding
behind
notwithstanding
i
was
alone
and
in
the
wilds
i
did
not
carry
any
kind
of
a
gun
the
work
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
ramble
the
wintry
heights
in
sunshine
and
storm
often
i
was
out
or
rather
up
in
a
blizzard
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
i
was
out
for
two
weeks
on
the
crest
of
the
continent
without
seeing
any
one
i
went
beyond
the
trails
and
visited
the
silent
places
alone
i
invaded
gulches
eagerly
walked
the
splendid
forest
aisles
wandered
in
the
dazzling
glare
on
dreary
alpine
moorlands
and
scaled
the
peaks
over
mantles
of
ice
and
snow
i
had
many
experiences
amusing
dangerous
and
exciting
there
was
abundance
of
life
and
fun
in
the
work
on
many
an
evening
darkness
captured
me
and
compelled
me
to
spend
the
night
in
the
wilds
without
bedding
and
often
without
food
during
these
nights
i
kept
a
blazing
until
daylight
released
me
when
the
night
was
mild
i
managed
to
sleep
a
little
in
installments
rising
from
time
to
time
to
give
wood
to
the
eager
fire
sometimes
a
scarcity
of
wood
kept
me
busy
gathering
it
all
night
and
sometimes
the
night
was
so
cold
that
i
did
not
risk
going
to
sleep
during
these
nights
i
watched
my
flaming
fountain
of
fire
brighten
fade
surge
and
change
or
shower
its
spray
of
sparks
upon
the
surrounding
strange
reveries
i
have
had
by
these
winter
on
a
few
occasions
mountain
lions
interrupted
my
thoughts
with
their
piercing
lonely
cries
and
more
than
once
a
reverie
was
pleasantly
changed
by
the
whisper
of
a
chickadee
in
some
tree
as
a
cold
comrade
snuggled
up
to
it
even
during
the
worst
of
nights
when
i
thought
of
my
lot
at
all
i
considered
it
better
than
that
of
those
who
were
sick
in
houses
or
asleep
in
the
stuffy
deadly
air
of
the
slums
believe
me
is
something
to
be
cast
face
to
face
with
thine
own
self
at
last
illustration
a
man
with
a
history
not
all
nights
were
spent
outdoors
many
a
royal
evening
was
passed
in
the
cabin
of
a
miner
or
a
prospector
or
by
the
fireside
of
a
family
who
for
some
reason
had
left
the
old
home
behind
and
sought
seclusion
in
wild
scenes
miles
from
neighbors
among
colorado
mountains
there
are
an
unusual
number
of
strong
characters
who
are
trying
again
they
are
strong
because
broken
plans
lost
fortunes
or
shattered
health
elsewhere
have
not
ended
their
efforts
or
changed
their
ideals
many
are
trying
to
restore
health
some
are
trying
again
to
prosper
others
are
just
making
a
start
in
life
but
there
are
a
few
who
far
from
the
madding
crowd
are
living
happily
the
simple
life
sincerity
hope
and
repose
enrich
the
lives
of
those
who
live
among
the
crags
and
pines
of
mountain
fastnesses
many
a
happy
evening
i
have
had
with
a
family
or
an
old
prospector
who
gave
me
interesting
scraps
of
autobiography
along
with
a
lodging
for
the
night
the
on
the
mountains
of
colorado
is
very
unevenly
distributed
and
is
scattered
through
seven
months
of
the
year
two
places
only
a
few
miles
apart
and
separated
by
a
may
have
very
different
climates
and
one
of
these
may
have
twice
as
much
as
the
other
on
the
middle
of
the
upper
slopes
of
the
mountains
the
snow
sometimes
falls
during
seven
months
of
the
year
at
an
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
the
annual
fall
amounts
to
eighteen
feet
this
is
several
times
the
amount
that
falls
at
an
altitude
of
six
thousand
feet
in
a
locality
near
crested
butte
the
annual
fall
is
thirty
feet
and
during
snowy
winters
even
fifty
feet
most
winter
days
are
clear
and
the
climate
less
severe
than
is
usually
imagined
one
winter
i
walked
on
snowshoes
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
snowy
range
of
the
rockies
from
the
wyoming
line
on
the
north
to
near
the
new
mexico
line
on
the
south
this
was
a
long
walk
and
it
was
full
of
amusement
and
adventure
i
walked
most
of
the
way
on
the
crest
of
the
continent
the
broken
nature
of
the
surface
gave
me
ups
and
downs
sometimes
i
would
descend
to
the
level
of
seven
thousand
feet
and
occasionally
i
climbed
some
peak
that
was
fourteen
thousand
feet
above
the
tides
i
had
not
been
out
many
days
on
this
trip
when
i
was
caught
in
a
storm
on
the
heights
above
i
at
once
started
downward
for
the
woods
the
way
among
the
crags
and
precipices
was
slippery
the
wind
threatened
every
moment
to
hurl
me
over
a
cliff
the
snow
filled
the
air
so
that
i
could
see
only
a
few
feet
and
at
times
not
at
all
but
it
was
too
cold
to
stop
for
two
hours
i
fought
my
way
downward
through
the
storm
and
so
dark
was
it
during
the
last
that
i
literally
felt
my
way
with
my
staff
once
in
the
woods
i
took
off
a
snowshoe
dug
a
large
hole
in
the
snow
down
to
the
earth
built
a
fire
and
soon
forgot
the
perilous
descent
after
eating
from
my
supply
of
raisins
i
dozed
a
little
and
woke
to
find
all
calm
and
the
moon
shining
in
glory
on
a
snowy
of
peaks
and
pines
i
put
on
my
snowshoes
climbed
upward
beneath
the
moon
and
from
the
summit
of
lead
mountain
thirteen
thousand
feet
high
saw
the
sun
rise
in
splendor
on
a
world
of
white
the
tracks
and
records
in
the
snow
which
i
read
in
passing
made
something
of
a
daily
newspaper
for
me
they
told
much
of
news
of
the
wilds
sometimes
i
read
of
the
games
that
the
snowshoe
rabbit
had
played
of
a
starving
time
among
the
brave
mountain
sheep
on
the
heights
of
the
quiet
content
in
the
ptarmigan
neighborhood
of
the
dinner
that
the
pines
had
given
the
grouse
of
the
amusements
and
exercises
on
the
deer
of
the
cunning
of
foxes
of
the
visits
of
magpies
the
excursions
of
lynxes
and
the
red
records
of
mountain
lions
the
mountain
lion
is
something
of
a
and
an
epicure
he
prefers
warm
blood
for
every
meal
and
is
very
wasteful
i
have
much
evidence
against
him
his
worst
record
that
i
have
shows
five
tragedies
in
this
time
he
killed
a
mountain
sheep
a
fawn
a
grouse
a
rabbit
and
a
porcupine
and
as
if
this
were
not
enough
he
was
about
to
kill
another
sheep
when
a
dark
object
on
snowshoes
shot
down
the
slope
near
by
and
disturbed
him
the
instances
where
he
has
attacked
human
beings
are
rare
but
he
will
watch
and
follow
one
for
hours
with
the
utmost
caution
and
curiosity
one
morning
after
a
through
the
wood
i
turned
back
and
doubled
my
trail
after
going
a
short
distance
i
came
to
the
track
of
a
lion
alongside
my
own
i
went
back
several
miles
and
read
the
lion
movements
he
had
watched
me
closely
at
every
place
where
i
rested
he
had
crept
up
close
and
at
the
place
where
i
had
sat
down
against
a
stump
he
had
crept
up
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
stump
and
i
fear
while
i
dozed
one
night
during
this
expedition
i
had
lodging
in
an
old
and
isolated
prospector
cabin
with
two
young
men
who
had
very
long
hair
for
months
they
had
been
in
seclusion
gathering
wonderful
herbs
hunting
out
prescriptions
for
every
human
ill
and
waiting
for
their
hair
to
grow
long
i
hope
they
prepared
some
helpful
or
at
least
harmless
prescriptions
for
ere
this
they
have
become
picturesque
and
i
fear
prosperous
on
some
populous
one
day
i
had
dinner
on
the
summit
of
mt
lincoln
fourteen
thousand
feet
above
the
ocean
i
ate
with
some
miners
who
were
digging
out
their
fortune
and
was
the
only
caller
in
five
months
but
i
was
not
always
a
welcome
guest
at
one
of
the
big
i
stopped
for
mail
and
to
rest
for
a
day
or
so
i
was
all
rags
and
tags
and
had
several
broken
strata
of
geology
and
charcoal
on
my
face
in
addition
before
i
had
got
well
into
the
town
from
all
quarters
came
dogs
each
of
which
seemed
determined
to
make
it
necessary
for
me
to
buy
some
clothes
as
i
had
already
determined
to
do
this
i
kept
the
dogs
at
bay
for
a
time
and
then
sought
refuge
in
a
hotel
from
this
the
porter
stimulated
by
an
excited
order
from
the
clerk
promptly
and
literally
kicked
me
out
in
the
robings
of
winter
how
different
the
mountains
than
when
dressed
in
the
bloom
of
summer
in
no
place
did
the
change
seem
more
marked
than
on
some
terrace
over
which
summer
flung
the
lacy
drapery
of
a
white
cascade
or
where
a
wild
waterfall
leapt
in
glory
these
places
in
winter
were
glorified
with
the
fine
arts
of
ice
frozen
music
as
some
one
has
defined
architecture
for
here
winter
had
constructed
from
water
a
wondrous
array
of
columns
panels
filigree
fretwork
arches
giant
icicles
and
stalagmites
as
large
as
and
in
ways
resembling
a
big
tree
with
a
fluted
mantle
of
ice
along
the
way
were
extensive
areas
covered
with
the
ruins
of
trees
most
of
the
forest
fires
which
had
caused
these
were
the
result
of
carelessness
the
timber
destroyed
by
these
fires
had
been
needed
by
thousands
of
the
robes
of
beauty
which
they
had
burned
from
the
are
a
serious
loss
these
fire
ruins
preyed
upon
me
and
i
resolved
to
do
something
to
save
the
remaining
forests
the
opportunity
came
shortly
after
the
resolution
was
made
two
days
before
reaching
the
objective
point
farthest
south
my
food
gave
out
and
i
fasted
but
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
end
i
started
to
descend
the
heights
and
very
naturally
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
first
house
i
came
to
and
asked
for
something
to
eat
i
supposed
i
was
at
a
pioneer
cabin
a
handsome
neatly
dressed
young
lady
came
to
the
door
and
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
me
she
blushed
and
then
turned
pale
i
was
sorry
that
my
appearance
had
alarmed
her
but
i
repeated
my
request
for
something
to
eat
just
then
through
the
door
behind
the
young
lady
came
the
laughter
of
children
and
a
glance
into
the
room
told
me
that
i
was
before
a
mountain
schoolhouse
by
this
time
the
teacher
to
whom
i
was
talking
startled
me
by
inviting
me
in
as
i
sat
eating
a
luncheon
to
which
the
teacher
and
each
one
of
the
six
contributed
the
teacher
explained
to
me
that
she
was
recently
from
the
east
and
that
i
so
well
fitted
her
ideas
of
a
western
desperado
that
she
was
frightened
at
first
when
i
finished
eating
i
made
my
first
speech
it
was
also
my
first
attempt
to
make
a
forestry
address
one
point
i
tried
to
bring
out
was
concerning
the
destruction
wrought
by
forest
fires
among
other
things
i
said
during
the
past
few
years
in
colorado
forest
fires
which
ought
never
to
have
been
started
have
destroyed
many
million
dollars
worth
of
timber
and
the
area
over
which
the
fires
have
burned
aggregates
thousand
square
miles
this
area
of
forest
would
put
on
the
equator
an
belt
one
mile
wide
that
would
reach
entirely
around
the
world
along
with
this
forest
have
perished
many
of
the
animals
and
thousands
of
beautiful
birds
who
had
homes
in
it
i
finally
bade
all
went
on
my
way
rejoicing
and
in
due
course
arrived
at
denver
where
a
record
of
one
of
my
longest
winter
excursions
was
written
in
order
to
give
an
idea
of
one
of
my
briefer
winter
walks
i
close
this
chapter
with
an
account
of
a
snowshoe
journey
from
estes
park
to
grand
lake
the
most
thrilling
and
adventurous
that
has
ever
entertained
me
on
the
trail
one
february
morning
i
set
off
alone
on
snowshoes
to
cross
the
range
for
the
purpose
of
making
some
the
nature
of
my
work
for
the
state
required
the
closest
observation
of
the
character
and
extent
of
the
snow
in
the
mountains
i
hoped
to
get
to
grand
lake
for
the
night
but
i
was
on
the
east
side
of
the
range
and
grand
lake
was
on
the
west
along
the
miles
of
trail
there
was
only
wilderness
without
a
single
house
the
trail
was
steep
and
the
snow
very
soft
five
hours
were
spent
in
gaining
which
was
only
six
miles
from
my
but
four
thousand
feet
above
it
rising
in
bold
grandeur
above
me
was
the
summit
of
long
peak
and
this
with
the
great
hills
of
drifted
snow
out
of
which
here
and
there
a
dwarfed
and
distorted
tree
thrust
its
top
made
seem
weird
and
lonely
from
this
point
the
trail
wound
for
six
miles
across
bleak
heights
before
it
came
down
to
timber
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
i
set
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
for
the
northern
sky
looked
stormy
i
must
not
only
climb
up
fifteen
hundred
feet
but
must
also
skirt
the
icy
edges
of
several
precipices
in
order
to
gain
the
summit
my
friends
had
warned
me
that
the
trip
was
a
foolhardy
one
even
on
a
clear
calm
day
but
i
was
fated
to
receive
the
fury
of
a
snowstorm
while
on
the
most
broken
portion
of
the
trail
the
tempest
came
on
with
deadly
cold
and
almost
blinding
violence
the
wind
came
with
awful
surges
and
roared
and
boomed
among
the
crags
the
clouds
dashed
and
seethed
along
the
surface
shutting
out
all
landmarks
i
was
every
moment
in
fear
of
slipping
or
being
blown
over
a
precipice
but
there
was
no
shelter
i
was
on
the
roof
of
the
continent
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
and
to
stop
in
the
bitter
cold
meant
death
illustration
the
crest
of
the
continent
in
winter
feet
above
it
was
still
three
miles
to
timber
on
the
west
slope
and
i
found
it
impossible
to
keep
the
trail
fearing
to
perish
if
i
tried
to
follow
even
the
general
course
of
the
trail
i
abandoned
it
altogether
and
started
for
the
head
of
a
gorge
down
which
i
thought
it
would
be
possible
to
climb
to
the
nearest
timber
nothing
definite
could
be
seen
the
clouds
on
the
snowy
surface
and
the
light
electrified
air
gave
the
eye
only
optical
illusions
the
outline
of
every
object
was
and
dim
the
large
stones
that
i
thought
to
step
on
were
not
there
and
when
apparently
passing
others
i
bumped
into
them
several
times
i
fell
headlong
by
stepping
out
for
a
drift
and
finding
a
depression
in
the
midst
of
these
illusions
i
walked
out
on
a
that
overhung
a
precipice
unable
to
see
clearly
i
had
no
realization
of
my
danger
until
i
felt
the
snow
giving
way
beneath
me
i
had
seen
the
precipice
in
summer
and
knew
it
was
more
than
a
thousand
feet
to
the
bottom
down
i
tumbled
carrying
a
large
fragment
of
the
with
me
i
could
see
nothing
and
i
was
entirely
helpless
then
just
as
the
full
comprehension
of
the
awful
thing
that
was
happening
swept
over
me
the
snow
falling
beneath
me
suddenly
stopped
i
plunged
into
it
completely
burying
myself
then
i
too
no
longer
moved
downward
my
mind
gradually
admitted
the
knowledge
that
my
body
together
with
a
considerable
mass
of
the
snow
had
fallen
upon
a
narrow
ledge
and
caught
there
more
of
the
snow
came
tumbling
after
me
and
it
was
a
matter
of
some
minutes
before
i
succeeded
in
extricating
myself
when
i
thrust
my
head
out
of
the
and
looked
about
me
i
was
first
appalled
by
a
glance
outward
which
revealed
the
terrible
height
of
the
precipice
on
the
face
of
which
i
was
hanging
then
i
was
relieved
by
a
glance
upward
which
showed
me
that
i
was
only
some
twenty
feet
from
the
top
and
that
a
return
thither
would
not
be
very
difficult
but
if
i
had
walked
from
the
top
a
few
feet
farther
back
i
should
have
fallen
a
quarter
of
a
mile
one
of
my
snowshoes
came
off
as
i
struggled
out
so
i
took
off
the
other
shoe
and
used
it
as
a
scoop
to
uncover
the
lost
web
but
it
proved
very
slow
and
dangerous
work
with
both
shoes
off
i
sank
in
the
snow
if
i
ventured
too
near
the
edge
of
the
ledge
the
snow
would
probably
slip
off
and
carry
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
it
was
only
after
two
hours
of
effort
that
the
shoe
was
recovered
when
i
first
struggled
to
the
surface
of
the
snow
on
the
ledge
i
looked
at
once
to
find
a
way
back
to
the
top
of
the
precipice
i
quickly
saw
that
by
following
the
ledge
a
few
yards
beneath
the
unbroken
i
could
climb
to
the
top
over
some
jagged
rocks
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
the
shoe
i
started
round
the
ledge
when
i
had
almost
reached
the
jagged
rocks
the
caved
upon
me
and
not
only
buried
me
but
came
perilously
near
knocking
me
into
the
depths
beneath
but
at
last
i
stood
upon
the
top
in
safety
a
short
walk
from
the
top
brought
me
out
upon
a
high
hill
of
snow
that
sloped
steeply
down
into
the
woods
the
snow
was
soft
and
i
sat
down
in
it
and
slid
a
blue
streak
my
blue
overalls
recording
the
streak
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
then
came
to
a
sudden
and
confusing
stop
one
of
my
webs
had
caught
on
a
spine
of
one
of
the
dwarfed
and
almost
buried
trees
at
when
i
had
traveled
a
short
distance
below
a
fearful
crashing
caused
me
to
turn
i
was
in
time
to
see
fragments
of
snow
flying
in
all
directions
and
boiling
up
in
a
great
geyser
column
a
had
swept
down
and
struck
a
granite
cliff
as
i
stood
there
another
slide
started
on
the
heights
above
timber
and
with
a
roar
swept
down
in
awful
magnificence
with
a
tail
of
just
at
it
struck
a
ledge
and
glanced
to
one
side
and
at
the
same
time
shot
up
into
the
air
so
high
that
for
an
instant
i
saw
the
treetops
beneath
it
but
it
came
back
to
earth
with
awful
force
and
i
felt
the
ground
tremble
as
it
crushed
a
wide
way
through
the
woods
it
finally
brought
up
at
the
bottom
of
a
gulch
with
a
wreckage
of
hundreds
of
noble
spruce
trees
that
it
had
crushed
down
and
swept
before
it
as
i
had
left
the
trail
on
the
heights
i
was
now
far
from
it
and
in
a
rugged
and
wholly
unfrequented
section
so
that
coming
upon
the
fresh
tracks
of
a
mountain
lion
did
not
surprise
me
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
what
occurred
soon
afterward
noticing
a
steamy
vapor
rising
from
a
hole
in
the
snow
by
the
protruding
roots
of
an
overturned
tree
i
walked
to
the
hole
to
learn
the
cause
of
it
one
whiff
of
the
vapor
stiffened
my
hair
and
limbered
my
legs
i
shot
down
a
steep
slope
dodging
trees
and
rocks
the
vapor
was
rank
with
the
odor
from
a
bear
illustration
a
track
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
i
found
the
frozen
surface
of
a
stream
much
easier
walking
than
the
soft
snow
all
went
well
until
i
came
to
some
rapids
where
with
no
warning
whatever
the
thin
ice
dropped
me
into
the
cold
current
among
the
boulders
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
with
the
ice
flying
like
broken
glass
the
water
came
only
a
little
above
my
knees
but
as
i
had
gone
under
the
surface
and
was
completely
drenched
i
made
an
enthusiastic
move
toward
the
bank
now
snowshoes
are
not
adapted
for
walking
either
in
swift
water
or
among
boulders
i
realized
this
thoroughly
after
they
had
several
times
tripped
me
sprawling
into
the
liquid
cold
finally
i
sat
down
in
the
water
took
them
off
and
came
out
gracefully
i
gained
the
bank
with
chattering
teeth
and
an
icy
armor
my
pocket
thermometer
showed
two
degrees
above
zero
another
storm
was
bearing
down
upon
me
from
the
range
and
the
sun
was
sinking
but
the
worst
of
it
all
was
that
there
were
several
miles
of
rough
and
strange
country
between
me
and
grand
lake
that
would
have
to
be
made
in
the
dark
i
did
not
care
to
take
any
more
chances
on
the
ice
so
i
spent
a
hard
hour
climbing
out
of
the
cañon
the
climb
warmed
me
and
set
my
clothes
steaming
my
watch
indicated
six
a
fine
snow
was
falling
and
it
was
dark
and
cold
i
had
been
exercising
for
twelve
hours
without
rest
and
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
previous
day
as
i
never
take
breakfast
i
made
a
fire
and
lay
down
on
a
rock
by
it
to
relax
and
also
to
dry
my
clothes
in
half
an
hour
i
started
on
again
rocky
and
ridges
lay
between
me
and
grand
lake
in
the
darkness
i
certainly
took
the
worst
way
i
met
with
too
much
resistance
in
the
thickets
and
too
little
on
the
slippery
places
so
that
when
at
eleven
that
night
i
entered
a
grand
lake
hotel
my
appearance
was
not
prepossessing
the
next
day
after
a
few
i
set
off
to
the
range
in
order
to
avoid
warm
and
cold
streams
i
took
a
different
route
it
was
a
much
longer
way
than
the
one
i
had
come
by
so
i
went
to
a
hunter
deserted
cabin
for
the
night
the
cabin
had
no
door
and
i
could
see
the
stars
through
the
roof
the
old
stove
was
badly
rusted
and
broken
most
of
the
night
i
spent
chopping
wood
and
i
did
not
sleep
at
all
but
i
had
a
good
rest
by
the
stove
where
i
read
a
little
from
a
musty
pamphlet
on
palmistry
that
i
found
between
the
logs
of
the
cabin
i
always
carry
candles
with
me
when
the
wind
is
blowing
the
wood
damp
and
the
fingers
numb
they
are
of
inestimable
value
in
kindling
a
fire
i
do
not
carry
firearms
and
during
the
night
when
a
lion
gave
a
screech
i
wished
he
were
somewhere
else
daylight
found
me
climbing
toward
the
top
of
the
range
through
the
medicine
bow
national
forest
among
some
of
the
noblest
evergreens
in
colorado
when
the
sun
came
over
the
range
the
silent
forest
vistas
became
magnificent
with
bright
lights
and
deep
shadows
at
the
bald
rounded
summit
of
the
range
like
a
gigantic
white
turtle
rose
a
thousand
feet
above
me
the
slope
was
steep
and
very
icy
a
gusty
wind
whirled
me
about
climbing
to
the
top
would
be
like
going
up
a
steep
it
would
be
a
dangerous
and
barely
possible
undertaking
but
as
i
did
not
have
courage
enough
to
retreat
i
threw
off
my
snowshoes
and
started
up
i
cut
a
place
in
the
ice
for
every
step
there
was
nothing
to
hold
to
and
a
slip
meant
a
fatal
slide
with
rushes
from
every
quarter
the
wind
did
its
best
to
freeze
or
overturn
me
my
ears
froze
and
my
fingers
grew
so
cold
that
they
could
hardly
hold
the
but
after
an
hour
of
constant
peril
and
exhaustion
i
got
above
the
last
ice
and
stood
upon
the
snow
the
snow
was
solidly
packed
and
leaving
my
snowshoes
strapped
across
my
shoulders
i
went
scrambling
up
near
the
top
of
the
range
a
ledge
of
granite
cropped
out
through
the
snow
and
toward
this
i
hurried
before
making
a
final
spurt
to
the
ledge
i
paused
to
breathe
as
i
stopped
i
was
startled
by
sounds
like
the
creaking
of
wheels
on
a
cold
snowy
street
the
snow
beneath
me
was
slipping
i
had
started
a
almost
instantly
the
slide
started
down
the
slope
with
me
on
it
the
direction
in
which
it
was
going
and
the
speed
it
was
making
would
in
a
few
seconds
carry
it
down
two
thousand
feet
of
slope
where
it
would
leap
over
a
precipice
into
the
woods
i
was
on
the
very
upper
edge
of
the
snow
that
had
started
and
this
was
the
of
the
slide
i
tried
to
stand
up
in
the
rushing
snow
but
its
speed
knocked
my
feet
from
under
me
and
in
an
instant
i
was
rolled
beneath
the
surface
beneath
the
snow
i
went
tumbling
on
with
it
for
what
seemed
like
a
long
time
but
i
know
of
course
that
it
was
for
only
a
second
or
two
then
my
feet
struck
against
something
solid
i
was
instantly
flung
to
the
surface
again
where
i
either
was
spilled
off
or
else
fell
through
the
end
of
the
slide
and
came
to
a
stop
on
the
scraped
and
frozen
ground
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
terrible
snow
i
leaped
to
my
feet
and
saw
the
slide
sweep
on
in
most
impressive
magnificence
at
the
front
end
of
the
slide
the
snow
piled
higher
and
higher
while
following
in
its
wake
were
splendid
streamers
and
scrolls
of
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
to
the
top
and
set
off
southward
where
after
six
miles
i
should
come
to
the
trail
that
led
to
my
on
the
east
side
of
the
range
after
i
had
made
about
three
miles
the
cold
clouds
closed
in
and
everything
was
fogged
a
chilly
wait
and
the
clouds
broke
up
i
had
lost
my
staff
in
the
and
feeling
for
precipices
without
it
would
probably
bring
me
out
upon
another
so
i
took
no
chances
i
was
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
when
the
clouds
broke
up
and
from
this
great
height
i
looked
down
upon
what
seemed
to
be
the
margin
of
the
polar
world
it
was
intensely
cold
but
the
sun
shone
with
dazzling
glare
and
the
wilderness
of
snowy
peaks
came
out
like
a
grand
and
jagged
in
the
far
south
halos
and
peculiarly
luminous
balls
floated
through
the
and
electrical
air
the
horizon
had
a
touch
of
cobalt
blue
and
on
the
dome
above
white
flushes
appeared
and
disappeared
like
faint
auroras
after
five
hours
on
these
silent
but
imposing
heights
i
struck
my
first
day
trail
and
began
a
wild
and
merry
coast
down
among
the
rocks
and
trees
to
my
i
hope
to
have
more
winter
excursions
but
perhaps
i
have
had
my
share
at
the
bare
thought
of
those
winter
experiences
i
am
again
on
an
unsheltered
peak
struggling
in
a
storm
or
i
am
in
a
calm
and
splendid
forest
upon
whose
snowy
peaceful
aisles
fall
the
purple
shadows
of
crags
and
pines
the
story
of
a
pine
the
peculiar
charm
and
fascination
that
trees
exert
over
many
people
i
had
always
felt
from
childhood
but
it
was
that
great
john
muir
who
first
showed
me
how
and
where
to
learn
their
language
few
trees
however
ever
held
for
me
such
an
attraction
as
did
a
gigantic
and
venerable
yellow
pine
which
i
discovered
one
autumn
day
several
years
ago
while
exploring
the
southern
rockies
it
grew
within
sight
of
the
mesa
verde
which
stands
at
the
corner
of
four
states
and
as
i
came
upon
it
one
evening
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
over
that
mysterious
tableland
its
character
and
heroic
proportions
made
an
impression
upon
me
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
which
familiar
acquaintance
only
served
to
deepen
while
it
yet
lived
and
before
the
axeman
came
many
a
time
i
returned
to
build
my
by
it
and
have
a
day
or
a
night
in
its
solitary
and
noble
company
i
learned
afterwards
that
it
had
been
given
the
name
old
pine
and
it
certainly
had
an
impressiveness
quite
compatible
with
the
age
and
dignity
which
go
with
a
thousand
years
of
life
when
one
day
the
at
mancos
wrote
come
we
are
about
to
log
your
old
pine
i
started
at
once
regretting
that
a
thing
which
seemed
to
me
so
human
as
well
as
so
noble
must
be
killed
illustration
a
veteran
western
yellow
pine
i
went
out
with
the
axemen
who
were
to
cut
the
old
pine
down
a
grand
and
impressive
tree
he
was
never
have
i
seen
so
much
individuality
so
much
character
in
a
tree
although
lightning
had
given
him
a
bald
crown
he
was
still
a
healthy
giant
and
was
waving
evergreen
banners
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifteen
feet
above
the
earth
his
massive
trunk
eight
feet
in
diameter
on
a
level
with
my
breast
was
covered
with
a
thick
rough
bark
which
was
broken
into
irregular
plates
several
of
his
arms
were
bent
and
broken
altogether
he
presented
a
timeworn
but
heroic
appearance
it
is
almost
a
marvel
that
trees
should
live
to
become
the
oldest
of
living
things
fastened
in
one
place
their
struggle
is
incessant
and
severe
from
the
moment
a
baby
tree
is
born
from
the
instant
it
casts
its
tiny
shadow
upon
the
ground
until
death
it
is
in
danger
from
insects
and
animals
it
can
not
move
to
avoid
danger
it
can
not
run
away
to
escape
enemies
fixed
in
one
spot
almost
helpless
it
must
endure
flood
and
drought
fire
and
storm
insects
and
earthquakes
or
die
trees
like
people
struggle
for
existence
and
an
aged
tree
like
an
aged
person
has
not
only
a
striking
appearance
but
an
interesting
biography
i
have
read
the
autobiographies
of
many
trees
and
have
found
their
strange
and
impressive
the
yearly
growth
or
annual
ring
of
wood
with
which
trees
envelop
themselves
is
embossed
with
so
many
of
their
experiences
that
this
annual
ring
of
growth
literally
forms
an
autobiographic
diary
of
the
tree
life
i
wanted
to
read
old
pine
autobiography
a
veteran
pine
that
had
stood
on
the
southern
rockies
and
struggled
and
triumphed
through
the
changing
seasons
of
hundreds
of
years
must
contain
a
rare
from
his
stand
between
the
mesa
and
the
mountain
he
had
seen
the
panorama
of
the
seasons
and
many
a
strange
pageant
he
had
beheld
what
scenes
of
animal
and
human
strife
what
storms
and
convulsions
of
nature
many
a
wondrous
secret
he
had
locked
within
his
tree
soul
yet
although
he
had
not
recorded
what
he
had
i
knew
that
he
had
kept
a
fairly
accurate
diary
of
his
own
personal
experience
this
i
knew
the
saw
would
reveal
and
this
i
had
determined
to
see
nature
matures
a
million
conifer
seeds
for
each
one
she
chooses
for
growth
so
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
the
selection
of
the
seed
from
which
sprung
this
storied
pine
it
may
be
that
the
cone
in
which
it
matured
was
crushed
into
the
earth
by
the
hoof
of
a
passing
deer
it
may
have
been
hidden
by
a
jay
or
as
is
more
likely
it
may
have
grown
from
one
of
the
uneaten
cones
which
a
douglas
squirrel
had
buried
for
winter
food
douglas
squirrels
are
the
principal
nurserymen
for
all
the
western
pineries
each
autumn
they
harvest
a
heavy
percentage
of
the
cone
crop
and
bury
it
for
winter
the
seeds
in
the
uneaten
cones
germinate
and
each
year
countless
thousands
of
conifers
grow
from
the
seeds
planted
by
these
squirrels
it
may
be
that
the
seed
from
which
old
pine
burst
had
been
planted
by
an
ancient
ancestor
of
the
protesting
douglas
who
was
in
possession
or
this
seed
may
have
been
in
a
cone
which
simply
bounded
or
blew
into
a
hole
where
the
seed
found
sufficient
mould
and
moisture
to
give
it
a
start
in
life
two
loggers
swung
their
axes
at
the
first
blow
a
douglas
squirrel
came
out
of
a
hole
at
the
base
of
a
dead
limb
near
the
top
of
the
tree
and
made
an
aggressive
claim
of
ownership
setting
up
a
vociferous
protest
against
the
cutting
as
his
voice
was
unheeded
he
came
scolding
down
the
tree
jumped
off
one
of
the
lower
limbs
and
took
refuge
in
a
young
pine
that
stood
near
by
from
time
to
time
he
came
out
on
the
top
of
the
limb
nearest
to
us
and
with
a
wry
face
fierce
whiskers
and
violent
gestures
directed
a
torrent
of
abuse
at
the
axemen
who
were
delivering
to
old
pine
the
old
pine
enormous
weight
caused
him
to
fall
heavily
and
he
came
to
earth
with
tremendous
force
and
struck
on
an
elbow
of
one
of
his
stocky
arms
the
force
of
the
fall
not
only
broke
the
trunk
in
two
but
badly
shattered
it
the
damage
to
the
log
was
so
general
that
the
said
it
would
not
pay
to
saw
it
into
lumber
and
that
it
could
rot
on
the
spot
i
had
come
a
long
distance
for
the
express
purpose
of
deciphering
old
pine
diary
as
the
scroll
of
his
life
should
be
laid
open
in
the
sawmill
the
abandonment
of
the
shattered
form
compelled
the
adoption
of
another
way
of
getting
at
his
story
receiving
permission
to
do
as
i
pleased
with
his
remains
i
at
once
began
to
cut
and
split
both
the
trunk
and
the
limbs
and
to
transcribe
their
strange
records
day
after
day
i
worked
i
dug
up
the
roots
and
thoroughly
dissected
them
and
with
the
aid
of
a
magnifier
i
studied
the
trunk
the
roots
and
the
limbs
i
carefully
examined
the
base
of
his
stump
and
in
it
i
found
rings
of
growth
he
had
lived
through
a
thousand
and
memorable
years
as
he
was
cut
down
in
his
birth
probably
occurred
in
in
looking
over
the
rings
of
growth
i
found
that
a
few
of
them
were
much
thicker
than
the
others
and
these
thick
rings
or
coats
of
wood
tell
of
favorable
seasons
there
were
also
a
few
extremely
thin
rings
of
growth
in
places
two
and
even
three
of
these
were
together
these
were
the
result
of
unfavorable
seasons
of
drought
or
cold
the
rings
of
trees
also
show
healed
wounds
and
tell
of
burns
bites
and
bruises
of
torn
bark
and
broken
arms
old
pine
not
only
received
injuries
in
his
early
years
but
from
time
to
time
throughout
his
life
the
somewhat
kinked
condition
of
several
of
the
rings
of
growth
beginning
with
the
twentieth
shows
that
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
sustained
an
injury
which
resulted
in
a
severe
curvature
of
the
spine
and
that
for
some
years
he
was
somewhat
stooped
i
was
unable
to
make
out
from
his
diary
whether
this
injury
was
the
result
of
a
tree
or
some
object
falling
upon
him
and
pinning
him
down
or
whether
his
back
had
been
overweighted
and
bent
by
wet
clinging
snow
as
i
could
not
find
any
scars
or
bruises
i
think
that
snow
must
have
been
the
cause
of
the
injury
however
after
a
few
years
he
straightened
up
with
youthful
vitality
and
seemed
to
outgrow
and
forget
the
experience
a
century
of
tranquil
life
followed
and
during
these
years
the
rapid
growth
tells
of
good
seasons
as
well
as
good
soil
this
rapid
growth
also
shows
that
there
could
not
have
been
any
crowding
neighbors
to
share
the
sun
and
the
soil
the
tree
had
grown
evenly
in
all
quarters
and
the
pith
of
the
tree
was
in
the
centre
but
had
one
tree
grown
close
on
that
quarter
the
old
pine
would
have
grown
slower
than
the
others
and
would
have
been
thinner
and
the
pith
would
thus
have
been
away
from
the
tree
centre
when
the
old
pine
was
just
completing
his
one
hundred
and
ring
of
growth
he
met
with
an
accident
which
i
can
account
for
only
by
assuming
that
a
large
tree
that
grew
several
yards
away
blew
over
and
in
falling
stabbed
him
in
the
side
with
two
dead
limbs
his
bark
was
broken
and
torn
but
this
healed
in
due
time
short
sections
of
the
dead
limbs
broke
off
however
and
were
embedded
in
the
old
pine
twelve
years
growth
covered
them
and
they
remained
hidden
from
view
until
my
splitting
revealed
them
the
other
wounds
started
promptly
to
heal
and
with
one
exception
did
so
a
year
or
two
later
some
ants
and
borers
began
excavating
their
deadly
winding
ways
in
the
old
pine
they
probably
started
to
work
in
one
of
the
places
injured
by
the
falling
tree
they
must
have
had
some
advantage
or
else
something
must
have
happened
to
the
nuthatches
and
chickadees
that
year
for
despite
the
vigilance
of
these
birds
both
the
borers
and
the
ants
succeeded
in
establishing
colonies
that
threatened
injury
and
possibly
death
fortunately
relief
came
one
day
the
chief
surgeon
of
all
the
southwestern
pineries
came
along
this
surgeon
was
the
texas
woodpecker
he
probably
did
not
long
explore
the
ridges
and
little
furrows
of
the
bark
before
he
discovered
the
wound
or
heard
these
hidden
insects
working
after
a
brief
examination
holding
his
ear
to
the
bark
for
a
moment
to
get
the
location
of
the
tree
deadly
foe
beneath
he
was
ready
to
act
he
made
two
successful
operations
these
not
only
required
him
to
cut
deeply
into
the
old
pine
and
take
out
the
borers
but
he
may
also
have
had
to
come
back
from
time
to
time
to
dress
the
wounds
by
devouring
the
which
may
have
persisted
in
taking
possession
of
them
the
wounds
finally
healed
and
only
the
splitting
of
the
affected
parts
revealed
these
records
all
filled
with
pitch
and
preserved
for
nearly
nine
hundred
years
following
this
an
even
tenor
marked
his
life
for
nearly
three
centuries
this
quiet
existence
came
to
an
end
in
the
summer
of
when
a
stroke
of
lightning
tore
a
limb
out
of
his
round
top
and
badly
shattered
a
shoulder
he
had
barely
recovered
from
this
injury
when
a
violent
wind
tore
off
several
of
his
arms
during
the
summer
of
he
lost
two
of
his
largest
arms
these
were
large
and
sound
and
were
more
than
a
foot
in
diameter
at
the
points
of
breakage
as
these
were
broken
by
a
weight
or
force
we
may
attribute
these
breaks
to
accumulations
of
snow
the
oldest
largest
portion
of
a
tree
is
the
short
section
immediately
above
the
ground
and
as
this
lower
section
is
the
most
exposed
to
accidents
or
to
injuries
from
enemies
it
generally
bears
evidence
of
having
suffered
the
most
within
its
scroll
are
usually
found
the
most
extensive
and
interesting
autobiographical
impressions
it
is
doubtful
if
there
is
any
portion
of
the
earth
upon
which
there
are
so
many
deadly
struggles
as
upon
the
earth
around
the
trunk
of
a
tree
upon
this
small
arena
there
are
battles
fierce
and
wild
here
nature
is
red
in
tooth
and
claw
when
a
tree
is
small
and
tender
countless
insects
come
to
feed
upon
it
birds
come
to
it
to
devour
these
insects
around
the
tree
are
daily
almost
merciless
fights
for
existence
these
occur
not
only
in
the
daytime
but
in
the
night
mice
rats
and
rabbits
destroy
millions
of
young
trees
these
bold
animals
often
flay
baby
trees
in
the
daylight
and
while
at
their
deadly
feast
many
a
time
have
they
been
surprised
by
hawks
and
then
they
are
at
a
banquet
where
they
themselves
are
eaten
the
owl
the
faithful
nightwatchman
of
trees
often
swoops
down
at
night
and
as
a
result
some
little
tree
is
splashed
with
the
blood
of
the
very
animal
that
came
to
feed
upon
it
the
lower
section
of
old
pine
trunk
contained
records
which
i
found
interesting
one
of
these
in
particular
aroused
my
imagination
i
was
sawing
off
a
section
of
this
lower
portion
when
the
saw
with
a
suddenly
jumped
the
object
struck
was
harder
than
the
saw
i
wondered
what
it
could
be
and
cutting
the
wood
carefully
away
laid
bare
a
flint
arrowhead
close
to
this
one
i
found
another
and
then
with
care
i
counted
the
rings
of
growth
to
find
out
the
year
that
these
had
wounded
old
pine
the
outer
ring
which
these
arrowheads
had
pierced
was
the
six
hundred
and
thirtieth
so
that
the
year
of
this
occurrence
was
had
an
indian
bent
his
bow
and
shot
at
a
bear
that
had
stood
at
bay
backed
up
against
this
tree
or
was
there
around
this
tree
a
battle
among
indian
tribes
is
it
possible
that
at
this
place
some
scouts
encountered
their
advancing
foe
from
the
north
and
opened
hostilities
it
may
be
that
around
old
pine
was
fought
the
battle
that
is
said
to
have
decided
the
fate
of
that
mysterious
race
the
the
imagination
insists
on
speculating
with
these
two
arrowheads
though
they
form
a
fascinating
clue
that
leads
us
to
no
definite
conclusion
but
the
fact
remains
that
old
pine
was
wounded
by
two
indian
arrowheads
some
time
during
his
six
hundred
and
thirtieth
summer
the
year
that
columbus
discovered
america
old
pine
was
a
handsome
giant
with
a
round
head
held
more
than
one
hundred
feet
above
the
earth
he
was
six
hundred
and
years
old
and
with
the
coming
of
the
spanish
adventurers
his
lower
trunk
was
given
new
events
to
record
the
year
was
a
particularly
memorable
one
for
him
this
year
brought
the
first
horses
and
bearded
men
into
the
drama
which
was
played
around
him
this
year
for
the
first
time
he
felt
the
edge
of
steel
and
the
tortures
of
fire
the
old
chronicles
say
that
the
spanish
explorers
found
the
in
the
year
i
believe
that
during
this
year
a
spanish
exploring
party
may
have
camped
beneath
old
pine
and
built
a
fire
against
his
instep
and
that
some
of
the
explorers
hacked
him
with
an
axe
the
old
pine
had
distinct
records
of
axe
and
fire
markings
during
the
year
it
was
not
common
for
the
indians
of
the
west
to
burn
or
mutilate
trees
and
as
it
was
common
for
the
spaniards
to
do
so
and
as
these
hackings
in
the
tree
seemed
to
have
been
made
with
some
edged
tool
sharper
than
any
possessed
by
the
indians
it
at
least
seems
probable
that
they
were
done
by
the
spaniards
at
any
rate
from
the
year
until
the
day
of
his
death
old
pine
carried
these
scars
on
his
instep
as
the
average
yearly
growth
of
the
old
pine
was
about
the
same
as
in
trees
similarly
situated
at
the
present
time
i
suppose
that
climatic
conditions
in
his
early
days
must
have
been
similar
to
the
climatic
conditions
of
his
records
indicate
periods
of
even
tenor
of
climate
a
year
of
extremely
poor
conditions
occasionally
a
year
crowned
with
a
bountiful
wood
harvest
from
to
i
found
little
of
special
interest
in
however
the
season
was
not
regular
after
the
ring
was
well
started
something
perhaps
a
cold
wave
for
a
time
checked
its
growth
and
as
a
result
the
wood
for
that
one
year
resembled
two
years
growth
but
yet
the
difference
between
this
double
or
false
ring
and
a
regular
one
was
easily
detected
old
pine
hard
times
experience
seems
to
have
been
during
the
years
and
i
think
it
probable
that
these
were
years
of
drought
during
the
layer
of
wood
was
the
thinnest
in
his
life
and
for
the
only
wood
i
could
find
was
a
layer
which
only
partly
covered
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
this
was
exceedingly
thin
from
time
to
time
in
the
old
pine
record
i
came
across
what
seemed
to
be
indications
of
an
earthquake
shock
but
late
in
or
early
in
i
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
experienced
a
violent
shock
for
he
made
extensive
records
of
it
this
earthquake
occurred
after
the
sap
had
ceased
to
flow
in
and
before
it
began
to
flow
in
the
spring
of
in
places
the
wood
was
checked
and
shattered
at
one
point
some
distance
from
the
ground
there
was
a
bad
horizontal
break
two
big
roots
were
broken
in
two
and
that
quarter
of
the
tree
which
faced
the
cliffs
had
suffered
from
a
rock
bombardment
i
suppose
the
violence
of
the
quake
displaced
many
rocks
and
some
of
these
as
they
came
bounding
down
the
collided
with
old
pine
one
of
about
five
pounds
weight
struck
him
so
violently
in
the
side
that
it
remained
embedded
there
after
some
years
the
wound
was
healed
over
but
this
fragment
remained
in
the
tree
until
i
released
it
during
some
one
made
an
on
the
old
pine
that
may
have
been
intended
for
a
and
during
the
same
year
another
fire
badly
burned
and
scarred
his
ankle
i
wonder
if
some
prospectors
came
this
way
in
and
made
camp
by
him
another
record
of
man
visits
to
the
tree
was
made
in
the
summer
of
when
i
think
a
hunting
or
outing
party
may
have
camped
near
here
and
amused
themselves
by
shooting
at
a
mark
on
old
pine
ankle
several
modern
were
found
embedded
in
the
wood
around
or
just
beneath
a
blaze
which
was
made
on
the
tree
the
same
year
in
which
the
bullets
had
entered
it
as
both
these
marks
were
made
during
the
year
it
is
at
least
possible
that
this
year
the
old
pine
was
used
as
the
background
for
a
target
during
a
shooting
contest
while
i
was
working
over
the
old
pine
a
douglas
squirrel
who
lived
near
by
used
every
day
to
stop
in
his
busy
harvesting
of
to
look
on
and
scold
me
as
i
watched
him
placing
his
cones
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
under
the
i
often
wondered
if
one
of
his
buried
cones
would
remain
there
uneaten
to
germinate
and
expand
ever
green
into
the
air
and
become
a
noble
giant
to
live
as
long
and
as
useful
a
life
as
old
pine
i
found
myself
trying
to
picture
the
scenes
in
which
this
tree
would
stand
when
the
birds
came
singing
back
from
the
southland
in
the
springtime
of
the
year
after
i
had
finished
my
work
of
splitting
studying
and
deciphering
the
fragments
of
the
old
pine
i
went
to
the
sawmill
and
arranged
for
the
men
to
come
over
that
evening
after
i
had
departed
and
burn
every
piece
and
vestige
of
the
venerable
old
tree
i
told
them
i
should
be
gone
by
dark
then
i
went
back
and
piled
into
a
pyramid
every
fragment
of
root
and
trunk
and
broken
branch
seating
myself
upon
this
pyramid
i
spent
some
time
that
afternoon
gazing
through
the
autumn
sunglow
at
the
hazy
mesa
verde
while
my
mind
rebuilt
and
shifted
the
scenes
of
the
long
long
drama
in
which
old
pine
had
played
his
part
and
of
which
he
had
given
us
but
a
few
fragmentary
records
i
lingered
there
dreaming
until
twilight
i
thought
of
the
cycles
during
which
he
had
stood
patient
in
his
appointed
place
and
my
imagination
busied
itself
with
the
countless
experiences
that
had
been
recorded
and
the
scenes
and
pageants
he
had
witnessed
but
of
which
he
had
made
no
record
i
wondered
if
he
had
enjoyed
the
changing
of
seasons
i
knew
that
he
had
often
boomed
or
hymned
in
the
storm
or
in
the
breeze
many
a
monumental
robe
of
had
he
worn
more
than
a
thousand
times
he
had
beheld
the
earth
burst
into
bloom
amid
the
happy
songs
of
mating
birds
hundreds
of
times
in
summer
he
had
worn
countless
crystal
in
the
sunlight
of
the
breaking
storm
while
the
brilliant
rainbow
came
and
vanished
on
the
ten
thousand
times
he
had
stood
silent
in
the
lonely
light
of
the
white
and
mystic
moon
twilight
was
fading
into
darkness
when
i
arose
and
started
on
a
for
the
mesa
verde
where
i
intended
next
morning
to
greet
an
old
gnarled
cedar
which
grew
on
its
summit
when
i
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
mesa
i
looked
back
and
saw
a
pyramid
of
golden
flame
standing
out
in
the
darkness
the
beaver
and
his
works
i
have
never
been
able
to
decide
which
i
love
best
birds
or
trees
but
as
these
are
really
comrades
it
does
not
matter
for
they
can
take
first
place
together
but
when
it
comes
to
second
place
in
my
affection
for
wild
things
this
i
am
sure
is
filled
by
the
beaver
the
beaver
has
so
many
interesting
ways
and
is
altogether
so
useful
so
thrifty
so
busy
so
skillful
and
so
picturesque
that
i
believe
his
life
and
his
deeds
deserve
a
larger
place
in
literature
and
a
better
place
in
our
hearts
his
engineering
works
are
of
great
value
to
man
they
not
only
help
to
distribute
the
waters
and
beneficially
control
the
flow
of
the
streams
but
they
also
catch
and
save
from
loss
enormous
quantities
of
the
earth
best
in
helping
to
do
these
two
things
governing
the
rivers
and
fixing
the
soil
he
plays
an
important
part
and
if
he
and
the
forest
had
their
way
with
the
floods
would
be
prevented
streams
would
never
run
dry
and
a
comparatively
even
flow
of
water
would
be
maintained
in
the
rivers
every
day
of
the
year
a
number
of
beaver
establishing
a
colony
made
one
of
the
most
interesting
exhibitions
of
constructive
work
that
i
have
ever
watched
the
work
went
on
for
several
weeks
and
i
spent
hours
and
days
in
observing
operations
my
on
a
granite
crag
allowed
me
a
good
view
of
the
work
the
cutting
and
transportation
of
the
little
logs
the
and
the
i
was
close
to
the
trees
that
were
felled
occasionally
during
the
construction
work
of
this
colony
i
saw
several
beaver
at
one
time
cutting
trees
near
one
another
upon
one
occasion
one
was
squatted
on
a
fallen
tree
another
on
the
limb
of
a
live
one
and
a
third
upon
a
boulder
each
busy
cutting
down
his
tree
in
every
case
the
tail
was
used
for
a
combination
stool
and
brace
while
cutting
the
beaver
sat
upright
and
clasped
the
willow
with
fore
paws
or
put
his
hands
against
the
tree
usually
tilting
his
head
to
one
side
the
average
diameter
of
the
trees
cut
was
about
four
inches
and
a
tree
of
this
size
was
cut
down
quickly
and
without
a
pause
when
the
tree
was
almost
cut
off
the
cutter
usually
thumped
with
his
tail
at
which
signal
all
other
cutters
near
by
scampered
away
but
this
warning
signal
was
not
always
given
and
in
one
instance
an
unwarned
cutter
had
a
narrow
escape
from
a
tree
falling
perilously
close
to
him
before
cutting
a
tree
a
beaver
usually
paused
and
appeared
to
look
at
its
surroundings
as
if
choosing
a
place
to
squat
or
sit
while
cutting
it
down
but
so
far
as
i
could
tell
he
gave
no
thought
as
to
the
direction
in
which
the
tree
was
going
to
fall
this
is
true
of
every
beaver
which
i
have
seen
begin
cutting
and
i
have
seen
scores
but
beavers
have
individuality
and
occasionally
i
noticed
one
with
marked
skill
or
decision
it
may
be
therefore
that
some
beaver
try
to
fell
trees
on
a
particular
place
in
fact
i
remember
having
seen
in
two
localities
stumps
which
suggested
that
the
beaver
who
cut
down
the
trees
had
planned
just
how
they
were
to
fall
in
the
first
locality
i
could
judge
only
from
the
record
left
by
the
stumps
but
the
quarter
on
which
the
main
notch
had
been
made
together
with
the
fact
that
the
notch
had
in
two
instances
been
made
on
a
quarter
of
the
tree
where
it
was
inconvenient
for
the
cutter
to
work
seemed
to
indicate
a
plan
to
fell
the
tree
in
a
particular
direction
in
the
other
locality
i
knew
the
attitude
of
the
trees
before
they
were
cut
and
in
this
instance
the
evidence
was
so
complete
and
conclusive
that
i
must
believe
the
beaver
that
cut
down
these
trees
endeavored
to
get
them
to
fall
in
a
definite
direction
in
each
of
these
cases
however
judging
chiefly
from
the
i
think
the
cuttings
were
done
by
the
same
beaver
many
observations
induce
me
to
believe
however
that
the
majority
of
beaver
do
not
plan
how
the
trees
are
to
fall
once
a
large
tree
is
on
the
ground
the
limbs
are
trimmed
off
and
the
trunk
is
cut
into
sections
sufficiently
small
to
be
dragged
rolled
or
pushed
to
the
water
where
transportation
is
easy
the
young
beaver
that
i
have
seen
cutting
trees
have
worked
in
leisurely
manner
in
contrast
with
the
work
of
the
old
ones
after
giving
a
few
bites
they
usually
stop
to
eat
a
piece
of
the
bark
or
to
stare
listlessly
around
for
a
time
as
workers
young
beaver
appear
at
their
best
and
liveliest
when
taking
a
limb
from
the
hillside
to
the
house
in
the
pond
a
young
beaver
will
catch
a
limb
by
one
end
in
his
teeth
and
throwing
it
over
his
shoulder
in
the
attitude
of
a
puppy
racing
with
a
rope
or
a
rag
make
off
to
the
pond
once
in
the
water
he
throws
up
his
head
and
swims
to
the
house
or
the
dam
with
the
limb
held
trailing
out
over
his
back
the
typical
seen
in
the
rockies
at
the
present
time
stands
in
the
upper
edge
of
the
pond
which
the
has
made
near
where
the
brook
enters
it
its
foundation
is
about
eight
feet
across
and
it
stands
from
five
to
ten
feet
in
height
a
rude
cone
in
form
most
houses
are
made
of
sticks
and
mud
and
are
apparently
put
up
with
little
thought
for
the
which
is
later
dug
or
gnawed
from
the
interior
the
entrance
to
the
house
is
below
and
commonly
on
the
bottom
of
the
lake
late
each
autumn
the
house
is
plastered
on
the
outside
with
mud
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
this
plaster
is
not
so
much
to
increase
the
warmth
of
the
house
as
to
give
it
when
the
mud
is
frozen
a
strong
protective
armor
an
armor
which
will
prevent
the
winter
enemies
of
the
beaver
from
breaking
into
the
house
each
autumn
beaver
pile
up
near
by
the
house
a
large
of
green
trunks
and
limbs
mostly
of
aspen
willow
cottonwood
or
alder
this
is
their
granary
and
during
the
winter
they
feed
upon
the
green
bark
supplementing
this
with
the
roots
of
which
they
drag
from
the
bottom
of
the
pond
along
in
may
five
baby
beaver
appear
and
a
little
later
these
explore
the
pond
and
race
wrestle
and
splash
water
in
it
as
merrily
as
boys
occasionally
they
sun
themselves
on
a
fallen
log
or
play
together
there
trying
to
push
one
another
off
into
the
water
often
they
play
in
the
canals
that
lead
between
ponds
or
from
them
or
on
the
slides
toward
the
close
of
summer
they
have
their
lessons
in
cutting
and
illustration
a
supply
of
winter
food
piled
on
the
right
a
beaver
appears
awkward
as
he
works
on
land
in
use
of
arms
and
hands
he
reminds
one
of
a
monkey
while
his
clumsy
and
usually
body
will
often
suggest
the
hippopotamus
by
using
head
hands
teeth
tail
and
webbed
feet
the
beaver
accomplishes
much
the
tail
of
a
beaver
is
a
useful
and
appendage
it
serves
as
a
rudder
a
stool
and
a
ramming
or
signal
club
the
beaver
use
his
tail
for
a
trowel
but
i
have
never
seen
him
so
use
it
his
four
front
teeth
are
excellent
for
his
logging
and
woodwork
his
webbed
feet
are
most
useful
in
his
transportation
and
his
hands
in
and
especially
in
it
is
in
that
the
beaver
shows
his
greatest
skill
and
his
best
headwork
for
i
confess
to
the
belief
that
a
beaver
reasons
i
have
so
often
seen
him
change
his
plans
so
wisely
and
meet
emergencies
so
promptly
and
well
that
i
can
think
of
him
only
as
a
reasoner
i
have
often
wondered
if
beaver
make
a
preliminary
survey
of
a
place
before
beginning
to
build
a
dam
i
have
seen
them
prowling
suggestively
along
brooks
just
prior
to
building
operations
there
and
circumstantial
evidence
would
credit
them
with
making
preliminary
surveys
but
of
this
there
is
no
proof
i
have
noticed
a
few
things
that
seem
to
have
been
considered
by
beaver
before
beginning
the
supply
of
food
and
of
material
for
instance
and
the
location
of
the
dam
so
as
to
require
the
minimum
amount
of
material
and
insure
the
creation
of
the
largest
reservoir
in
making
the
dam
the
beaver
usually
takes
advantage
of
boulders
and
surface
irregularities
but
he
often
makes
errors
of
judgment
i
have
seen
him
abandon
dams
both
before
and
after
completion
the
apparent
reasons
were
that
the
dam
either
had
failed
or
would
fail
to
flood
the
area
which
he
needed
or
desired
flooded
his
endeavors
are
not
always
successful
about
twenty
years
ago
near
helena
montana
a
number
of
beaver
made
an
audacious
attempt
to
dam
the
missouri
river
after
long
and
persistent
effort
however
they
gave
it
up
the
beaver
may
be
credited
with
errors
failures
and
successes
he
has
forethought
if
a
colony
of
beaver
be
turned
loose
upon
a
brook
in
the
wilds
and
left
undisturbed
for
a
season
or
until
they
have
had
time
to
select
a
site
and
locate
themselves
to
best
advantage
it
is
probable
that
the
location
chosen
will
indicate
that
they
have
examined
the
entire
brook
and
then
selected
the
best
place
as
soon
as
the
beaver
brush
dam
is
completed
it
begins
to
accumulate
trash
and
mud
in
a
little
while
usually
it
is
covered
with
a
mass
of
soil
shrubs
of
willow
begin
to
grow
upon
it
and
after
a
few
years
it
is
a
strong
earthy
dam
the
dams
vary
in
length
from
a
few
feet
to
several
hundred
feet
i
measured
one
on
the
south
platte
river
that
was
eleven
hundred
feet
long
the
influence
of
a
is
astounding
as
soon
as
completed
it
becomes
a
highway
for
the
folk
of
the
wild
it
is
used
day
and
night
mice
and
porcupines
bears
and
rabbits
lions
and
wolves
make
a
bridge
of
it
from
it
in
the
evening
the
graceful
deer
cast
their
reflections
in
the
quiet
pond
over
it
dash
pursuer
and
pursued
and
on
it
take
place
battles
and
courtships
it
is
often
torn
by
hoof
and
claw
of
animals
locked
in
and
often
very
often
it
is
stained
with
blood
many
a
drama
picturesque
fierce
and
wild
is
staged
upon
a
an
interesting
and
valuable
book
could
be
written
concerning
the
earth
as
modified
and
benefited
by
beaver
action
and
i
have
long
thought
that
the
beaver
deserved
at
least
a
chapter
in
masterly
book
the
earth
as
modified
by
human
action
to
work
like
a
beaver
is
an
almost
universal
expression
for
energetic
persistence
but
who
realizes
that
the
beaver
has
accomplished
anything
almost
unread
of
and
unknown
are
his
monumental
works
the
instant
a
is
completed
it
has
a
decided
influence
on
the
flow
of
the
water
and
especially
on
the
quantity
of
sediment
which
the
passing
water
carries
the
sediment
instead
of
going
down
to
fill
the
channel
below
or
to
clog
the
river
mouth
fill
the
harbor
and
do
damage
a
thousand
miles
away
is
accumulated
in
the
pond
behind
the
dam
and
a
level
deposit
is
formed
over
the
entire
area
of
the
lake
by
and
by
this
deposit
is
so
great
that
the
lake
is
filled
with
sediment
but
before
this
happens
both
lake
and
dam
check
and
delay
so
much
that
floods
are
diminished
in
volume
and
the
water
thus
delayed
is
in
part
added
to
the
flow
of
the
streams
at
the
time
of
low
water
the
result
being
a
more
even
at
all
times
the
regulation
of
is
important
there
are
only
a
few
rainy
days
each
year
and
all
the
water
that
flows
down
the
rivers
falls
on
these
few
rainy
days
the
instant
the
water
reaches
the
earth
it
is
hurried
away
toward
the
sea
and
unless
some
agency
delays
the
the
rivers
would
naturally
contain
water
only
on
the
rainy
days
and
a
little
while
after
the
fact
that
some
rivers
contain
water
at
all
times
is
but
evidence
that
something
has
held
in
check
a
portion
of
the
water
which
fell
during
these
rainy
days
illustration
a
in
winter
among
the
agencies
which
best
perform
this
service
of
keeping
the
streams
are
the
forests
and
the
works
of
the
beaver
rainfall
accumulates
in
the
brooks
the
brooks
conduct
the
water
to
the
rivers
if
across
a
river
there
be
a
the
pond
formed
by
it
will
be
a
reservoir
which
will
catch
and
retain

of
all

which

it

leaky
ones
and
if
they
are
stored

days
the
leaking
helps
to
maintain

a
thus
tends
to
distribute
to
the

a
moderate
quantity
of
water
each

in
other
words
it
spreads
out
or
distributes
the

of

days
through
all

of

a
river
which
flows
steadily
throughout
the

is
of
inestimable
value
to
mankind
if
floods
sweep
a
river
they
do
damage
if
low

comes
the

of
steamers
and
of
manufactories
cease
to

damage
or
death
may
result
in

the
extremes
of
high
and
low
water
the
beaver
work
is
of
profound
importance
in
helping
beneficially
to
control
a
river
the
beaver
would
render
enormous
service
if
allowed
to
construct
his
works
at
its
source
during
times
of
heavy
rainfall
the
carries
with
it
especially
in
unforested
sections
great
quantities
of
soil
and
sediment
catch
much
of
the
material
eroded
from
the
hillsides
above
and
also
prevent
much
erosion
along
the
streams
which
they
govern
they
thus
catch
and
deposit
in
place
much
valuable
soil
the
cream
of
the
earth
that
otherwise
would
be
washed
away
and
lost
washed
away
into
the
rivers
and
harbors
impeding
navigation
and
increasing
river
and
harbor
bills
there
is
an
old
indian
legend
which
says
that
after
the
creator
separated
the
land
from
the
water
he
employed
gigantic
beavers
to
smooth
it
down
and
prepare
it
for
the
abode
of
man
this
is
appreciative
and
suggestive
have
had
much
to
do
with
the
shaping
and
creating
of
a
great
deal
of
the
richest
agricultural
land
in
america
there
are
many
peaceful
and
productive
valleys
the
soil
of
which
has
been
accumulated
and
fixed
in
place
by
ages
of
engineering
activities
on
the
part
of
the
beaver
before
the
white
man
came
on
both
mountain
and
plain
you
may
still
see
much
of
this
good
work
accomplished
by
them
in
the
mountains
deep
and
almost
useless
gulches
have
been
filled
by
with
sediment
and
in
course
of
time
changed
to
meadows
so
far
as
i
know
the
upper
course
of
every
river
in
the
rockies
is
through
a
number
of
some
of
them
acres
in
extent
on
the
upper
course
of
grand
river
in
colorado
i
once
made
an
extensive
examination
of
some
old
series
of
had
been
extended
along
this
stream
for
several
miles
as
many
as
twenty
dams
to
the
mile
each
succeeding
dam
had
backed
water
to
the
one
above
it
these
had
accumulated
soil
and
formed
a
series
of
terraces
which
with
the
moderate
slope
of
the
valley
had
in
time
formed
an
extensive
and
comparatively
level
meadow
for
a
great
distance
along
the
river
the
beaver
settlement
on
this
river
was
long
ago
almost
entirely
destroyed
and
the
year
before
my
arrival
a
cloudburst
had
fallen
upon
the
above
and
the
flood
had
in
places
eroded
deeply
into
the
deposits
formed
by
the
at
one
place
the
water
had
cut
down
feet
and
had
brought
to
light
the
fact
that
the
deposit
had
been
formed
by
a
series
of
dams
one
above
the
other
a
new
dam
having
been
built
or
the
old
one
increased
in
height
when
the
deposit
of
sediment
had
filled
or
nearly
filled
the
pond
this
is
only
one
instance
there
are
thousands
of
similar
places
in
the
rockies
where
have
accumulated
deposits
of
greater
or
less
extent
than
those
on
the
grand
river
only
a
few
beaver
remain
and
though
much
of
their
work
will
endure
to
serve
mankind
in
many
places
their
old
work
is
gone
or
is
going
to
ruin
for
the
want
of
attention
we
are
paying
dearly
for
the
thoughtless
and
almost
complete
destruction
of
this
animal
a
live
beaver
is
far
more
valuable
to
us
than
a
dead
one
soil
is
eroding
away
are
filling
and
most
of
the
streams
in
the
united
states
fluctuate
between
flood
and
low
water
a
beaver
colony
at
the
source
of
every
stream
would
moderate
these
extremes
and
add
to
the
picturesqueness
and
beauty
of
many
scenes
that
are
now
growing
ugly
with
erosion
we
need
to
coöperate
with
the
beaver
he
would
assist
the
work
of
reclamation
and
be
of
great
service
in
maintaining
the
i
trust
he
will
be
assisted
in
colonizing
our
national
forests
and
allowed
to
cut
timber
there
without
a
permit
the
beaver
is
the
of
the
wild
may
his
tribe
increase
the
wilds
without
firearms
had
i
encountered
the
two
gray
wolves
during
my
first
unarmed
into
the
wilds
the
experience
would
hardly
have
suggested
to
me
that
going
without
firearms
is
the
best
way
to
enjoy
wild
nature
but
i
had
made
many
unarmed
excursions
beyond
the
trail
before
i
had
that
adventure
and
the
habit
of
going
without
a
gun
was
so
firmly
fixed
and
so
satisfactory
that
even
a
perilous
wolf
encounter
did
not
arouse
any
desire
for
firearms
the
habit
continued
and
the
only
way
i
can
enjoy
the
wilds
is
to
leave
guns
behind
on
that
autumn
afternoon
i
was
walking
along
slowly
reflectively
in
a
deep
forest
not
a
breath
of
air
moved
and
even
the
aspen
golden
leaves
stood
still
in
the
sunlight
all
was
calm
and
peaceful
around
and
within
me
when
i
came
to
a
little
sunny
surrounded
by
tall
crowding
pines
i
felt
drawn
to
its
warmth
and
repose
and
stepped
joyfully
into
it
suddenly
two
gray
wolves
sprang
from
almost
beneath
my
feet
and
faced
me
defiantly
at
a
few
feet
distance
they
made
an
impressive
show
of
ferocity
standing
ready
apparently
to
hurl
themselves
upon
me
now
the
gray
wolf
is
a
powerful
savage
beast
and
directing
his
strong
jaws
tireless
muscles
keen
scent
and
eyes
are
exceedingly
nimble
wits
he
is
well
equipped
to
make
the
severe
struggle
for
existence
which
his
present
environment
compels
in
many
western
localities
despite
the
high
price
offered
for
his
scalp
he
has
managed
not
only
to
live
but
to
increase
and
multiply
i
had
seen
gray
wolves
pull
down
big
game
on
one
occasion
i
had
seen
a
vigorous
steer
fall
after
a
desperate
struggle
with
two
of
these
fearfully
fanged
animals
many
times
i
had
come
across
scattered
bones
which
told
of
their
triumph
and
altogether
i
was
so
impressed
with
their
deadliness
that
a
glimpse
of
one
of
them
usually
gave
me
over
to
a
temporary
dread
the
two
wolves
facing
me
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
in
the
sun
when
i
disturbed
them
i
realized
the
danger
and
was
alarmed
of
course
but
my
faculties
were
under
control
were
stimulated
indeed
to
unusual
alertness
and
i
kept
a
bold
front
and
faced
them
without
flinching
their
expression
was
one
of
mingled
surprise
and
anger
together
with
the
apparent
determination
to
sell
their
lives
as
dearly
as
possible
i
gave
them
all
the
attention
which
their
appearance
and
their
reputation
demanded
not
once
did
i
take
my
eyes
off
them
i
held
them
at
bay
with
my
eyes
i
still
have
a
vivid
picture
of
terribly
gleaming
teeth
bristling
backs
and
bulging
muscles
in
savage
readiness
they
made
no
move
to
attack
i
was
afraid
to
attack
and
i
dared
not
run
away
i
remembered
that
some
trees
i
could
almost
reach
behind
me
had
limbs
that
stretched
out
toward
me
yet
i
felt
that
to
wheel
spring
for
a
limb
and
swing
up
beyond
their
reach
could
not
be
done
quickly
enough
to
escape
those
fierce
jaws
both
sides
were
of
the
same
mind
ready
to
fight
but
not
at
all
eager
to
do
so
under
these
conditions
our
nearness
was
embarrassing
and
we
faced
each
other
for
what
seemed
to
me
at
least
a
long
time
my
mind
working
like
lightning
i
thought
of
several
possible
ways
of
escaping
i
considered
each
at
length
found
it
faulty
and
dismissed
it
meanwhile
not
a
sound
had
been
made
i
had
not
moved
but
something
had
to
be
done
slowly
i
worked
the
small
folding
axe
from
its
sheath
and
with
the
slowest
of
movements
placed
it
in
my
right
with
the
handle
up
ready
for
instant
use
i
did
this
with
studied
deliberation
lest
a
sudden
movement
should
release
the
springs
that
held
the
wolves
back
i
kept
on
staring
statues
almost
we
must
have
appeared
to
the
whose
call
from
a
limb
told
me
we
were
observed
and
whose
nearness
gave
me
courage
then
looking
the
nearer
of
the
two
wolves
squarely
in
the
eye
i
said
to
him
well
why
do
you
move
as
though
we
were
playing
checkers
instead
of
the
game
of
life
he
made
no
reply
but
the
spell
was
broken
i
believe
that
both
sides
had
been
bluffing
in
attempting
to
use
my
kodak
while
continuing
the
bluff
i
brought
matters
to
a
focus
what
a
picture
you
fellows
will
make
i
said
aloud
as
my
right
hand
slowly
worked
the
kodak
out
of
the
case
which
hung
under
my
left
arm
still
keeping
up
a
steady
fire
of
looks
i
brought
the
kodak
in
front
of
me
ready
to
focus
and
then
touched
the
spring
that
released
the
folding
front
when
the
kodak
mysteriously
suddenly
opened
before
the
wolves
they
fled
for
their
lives
in
an
instant
they
had
cleared
the
grassy
space
and
vanished
into
the
woods
i
did
not
get
their
picture
with
a
gun
the
wolf
encounter
could
not
have
ended
more
happily
at
any
rate
i
have
not
for
a
moment
cared
for
a
gun
since
i
returned
enthusiastic
from
my
first
delightful
trip
into
the
wilds
without
one
out
in
the
wilds
with
nature
is
one
of
the
safest
and
most
sanitary
of
places
bears
are
not
seeking
to
devour
and
the
from
lions
wolves
snakes
and
all
other
bugbears
combined
does
not
equal
the
from
fire
automobiles
or
banquets
being
afraid
of
nature
or
a
rainstorm
is
like
being
afraid
of
the
dark
the
time
of
that
first
excursion
was
spent
among
scenes
that
i
had
visited
before
but
the
discoveries
i
made
and
the
deeper
feelings
it
stirred
within
me
led
me
to
think
it
more
worth
while
than
any
previous
trip
among
the
same
delightful
scenes
the
first
day
especially
was
excitingly
crowded
with
new
sights
and
sounds
and
fancies
i
fear
that
during
the
earlier
trips
the
rifle
had
obscured
most
of
the
scenes
in
which
it
could
not
figure
and
as
a
result
i
missed
fairyland
and
most
of
the
sunsets
illustration
lake
odessa
when
i
arrived
at
the
alpine
lake
by
which
i
was
to
camp
long
rays
and
shadows
were
romantically
robing
the
picturesque
wild
border
of
the
lake
the
crags
the
temples
the
snowdrifts
and
the
of
this
wild
garden
seemed
as
over
them
the
long
lights
and
torn
shadows
grouped
and
changed
lingered
and
vanished
in
the
last
moments
of
the
sun
the
deep
purple
of
evening
was
over
all
and
the
ruined
crag
with
the
broken
pine
on
the
was
black
against
the
golden
glow
when
i
hastened
to
make
camp
by
a
pine
temple
while
the
beautiful
world
of
sunset
hour
slowly
faded
into
the
night
the
was
a
in
the
darkness
and
the
small
evergreen
temple
before
me
shone
an
illuminated
cathedral
in
the
night
all
that
evening
i
believed
in
fairies
and
by
watching
the
changing
kept
my
fancies
frolicking
in
realms
of
mystery
where
all
the
world
was
young
i
lay
down
without
a
gun
and
while
the
fire
changed
and
faded
to
black
and
gray
the
coyotes
began
to
howl
but
their
voices
did
not
seem
as
lonely
or
menacing
as
when
i
had
had
a
rifle
by
my
side
as
i
lay
listening
to
them
i
thought
i
detected
merriment
in
their
tones
and
in
a
little
while
their
shouts
rang
as
merrily
as
though
they
were
boys
at
play
never
before
had
i
realized
that
coyotes
too
had
enjoyments
and
i
listened
to
their
shouts
with
pleasure
at
last
the
illumination
faded
from
the
cathedral
grove
and
its
templed
top
stood
in
charcoal
against
the
clear
heavens
as
i
fell
asleep
beneath
the
peaceful
stars
the
next
morning
i
loitered
here
and
there
getting
acquainted
with
the
for
without
a
gun
all
objects
or
my
eyes
were
so
changed
that
i
had
only
a
dim
recollection
of
having
seen
the
place
before
from
time
to
time
as
i
walked
about
i
stopped
to
try
to
win
the
confidence
of
the
small
folk
in
fur
and
feathers
i
found
some
that
trusted
me
and
at
noon
a
chipmunk
a
a
chickadee
and
myself
were
several
times
busy
with
the
same
bit
of
luncheon
at
once
some
years
ago
mountain
sheep
often
came
in
flocks
to
lick
the
salty
soil
in
a
ruined
crater
on
specimen
mountain
one
day
i
climbed
up
and
hid
myself
in
the
crags
to
watch
them
more
than
a
hundred
of
them
came
after
licking
for
a
time
many
lay
down
some
of
the
rams
posed
themselves
on
the
rocks
in
heroic
attitudes
and
looked
serenely
and
watchfully
around
young
lambs
ran
about
and
a
few
occasionally
raced
up
and
down
smooth
rocky
steeps
seemingly
without
the
slightest
regard
for
the
laws
of
falling
bodies
i
was
close
to
the
flock
but
luckily
they
did
not
suspect
my
presence
after
enjoying
their
fine
wild
play
for
more
than
two
hours
i
slipped
away
and
left
them
in
their
home
among
the
crags
one
spring
day
i
paused
in
a
whirl
of
mist
and
wet
snow
to
look
for
the
trail
i
could
see
only
a
few
yards
ahead
as
i
peered
ahead
a
bear
emerged
from
the
gloom
heading
straight
for
me
behind
her
were
two
cubs
i
caught
her
impatient
expression
when
she
beheld
me
she
stopped
and
then
with
a
growl
of
anger
she
wheeled
and
boxed
cubs
right
and
left
like
an
angry
mother
the
bears
disappeared
in
the
direction
from
which
they
had
come
the
cubs
urged
on
with
spanks
from
behind
as
all
vanished
in
the
falling
snow
the
gray
douglas
squirrel
is
one
of
the
most
active
audacious
and
outspoken
of
animals
he
enjoys
seclusion
and
claims
to
be
monarch
of
all
he
surveys
and
no
trespasser
is
too
big
to
escape
a
scolding
from
him
many
times
he
has
given
me
a
terrible
with
a
desperate
accompaniment
of
fierce
facial
expressions
bristling
whiskers
and
emphatic
gestures
i
love
this
brave
fellow
creature
but
if
he
were
only
a
few
inches
bigger
i
should
never
risk
my
life
in
his
woods
without
a
gun
this
is
a
beautiful
world
and
all
who
go
out
under
the
open
sky
will
feel
the
gentle
kindly
influence
of
nature
and
hear
her
good
tidings
the
forests
of
the
earth
are
the
flags
of
nature
they
appeal
to
all
and
awaken
inspiring
universal
feelings
enter
the
forest
and
the
boundaries
of
nations
are
forgotten
it
may
be
that
some
time
an
immortal
pine
will
be
the
flag
of
a
united
and
peaceful
world
a
watcher
on
the
heights
while
on
the
as
state
snow
observer
i
had
one
adventure
with
the
elements
that
called
for
the
longest
special
report
that
i
have
ever
written
perhaps
i
can
not
do
better
than
quote
this
report
transmitted
to
professor
carpenter
at
denver
on
may
notes
on
the
poudre
flood
the
day
before
the
poudre
flood
i
traveled
for
eight
hours
northwesterly
along
the
top
of
the
continental
divide
all
the
time
being
above
and
from
eleven
thousand
to
twelve
thousand
feet
above
the
morning
was
cloudless
and
hot
the
western
sky
was
marvelously
clear
eastward
a
thin
dark
haze
overspread
everything
below
ten
thousand
feet
by
this
haze
had
ascended
higher
than
where
i
was
at
nine
the
snow
on
which
i
walked
though
it
had
been
frozen
hard
during
the
night
was
soggy
and
wet
about
a
calm
that
had
prevailed
all
the
morning
gave
way
before
an
easy
intermittent
warm
breeze
from
the
southeast
at
the
first
cloud
appeared
in
the
north
just
above
peak
it
was
a
heavy
cumulus
cloud
but
i
do
not
know
from
what
direction
it
came
it
rose
high
in
the
air
drifted
slowly
toward
the
west
and
then
seemed
to
dissolve
at
any
rate
it
vanished
about
several
heavy
clouds
rose
from
behind
long
peak
moving
toward
the
northwest
rising
higher
into
the
sky
as
they
advanced
illustration
on
the
heights
the
wind
at
first
in
fitful
dashes
from
the
southeast
began
to
come
more
steadily
and
swiftly
after
eleven
and
was
so
warm
that
the
snow
softened
to
a
sloppy
state
the
air
carried
a
tinge
of
haze
and
conditions
were
oppressive
it
was
labor
to
breathe
never
except
one
deadly
hot
july
day
in
new
york
city
have
i
felt
so
overcome
with
heat
and
choking
air
perspiration
simply
streamed
from
me
these
oppressive
conditions
continued
for
two
hours
until
about
one
while
they
lasted
my
eyes
pained
ached
and
twitched
there
was
no
glare
but
only
by
keeping
my
eyes
closed
could
i
stand
the
pain
finally
i
came
to
some
crags
and
lay
down
for
a
time
in
the
shade
i
was
up
eleven
thousand
five
hundred
feet
and
the
time
was
as
i
lay
on
the
snow
gazing
upward
i
became
aware
that
there
were
several
flotillas
of
clouds
of
from
seven
to
twenty
each
and
these
were
moving
toward
every
point
of
the
compass
each
seemed
on
a
different
stratum
of
air
and
each
moved
through
space
a
considerable
distance
above
or
below
the
others
the
clouds
moving
eastward
were
the
highest
most
of
the
lower
clouds
were
those
moving
westward
the
haze
and
sunlight
gave
color
to
every
cloud
and
this
color
varied
from
smoky
red
to
orange
at
two
the
haze
came
in
from
the
east
almost
as
dense
as
a
crossed
the
ridge
before
me
and
spread
out
as
dark
and
foreboding
as
the
smoke
of
vesuvius
behind
me
the
haze
rolled
upward
when
it
struck
the
ridge
and
i
had
clear
glimpses
whenever
i
looked
to
the
southwest
this
heavy
muddy
haze
prevailed
for
a
little
more
than
half
an
hour
and
as
it
cleared
the
clouds
began
to
disappear
but
a
gauzy
haze
still
continued
in
the
air
the
feeling
in
the
air
was
not
agreeable
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
felt
alarmed
by
the
shifting
rioting
clouds
and
the
weird
haze
i
arrived
at
south
of
poudre
lakes
about
and
for
more
than
half
an
hour
the
sky
except
in
the
east
over
the
foothills
was
clear
and
the
sunlight
struck
a
glare
from
the
snow
with
the
cleared
air
there
came
to
me
an
easier
feeling
the
oppressiveness
ceased
i
descended
a
short
distance
into
the
woods
and
relaxed
on
a
fallen
tree
that
lay
above
the
snow
i
had
been
there
but
a
little
while
when
snap
buzz
buzz
buzz
ziz
ziz
and
electricity
began
to
pull
my
hair
and
hum
around
my
ears
the
electricity
passed
off
shortly
but
in
a
little
while
it
caught
me
again
by
the
hair
for
a
brief
time
and
this
time
my
right
arm
momentarily
cramped
and
my
heart
seemed
to
give
several
lurches
i
arose
and
tramped
on
and
downward
but
every
little
while
i
was
in
for
shocking
treatment
the
electrical
waves
came
from
the
southwest
and
moved
northeast
they
were
separated
by
periods
of
from
one
to
several
minutes
in
length
and
were
about
two
seconds
in
passing
during
their
presence
they
made
it
lively
for
me
with
and
muscular
cramps
i
tried
moving
speedily
with
the
wave
also
standing
still
and
lying
down
hoping
that
the
wave
would
pass
me
by
but
in
each
and
every
case
it
gave
me
the
same
stirring
treatment
once
i
stood
erect
and
rigid
as
the
wave
came
on
but
it
intensified
suddenly
the
rigidity
of
every
muscle
to
a
seemingly
rupturing
extent
and
i
did
not
try
that
plan
again
the
effect
of
each
wave
on
me
seemed
to
be
slightly
weakened
whenever
i
lay
down
and
fully
relaxed
my
muscles
i
was
on
a
northerly
slope
in
spruce
timber
tramping
over
five
feet
of
snow
during
these
electrical
waves
the
points
of
dry
twigs
were
tipped
with
a
smoky
blue
flame
and
sometimes
bands
of
this
bluish
flame
encircled
green
trees
just
below
their
lower
limbs
i
looked
at
the
compass
a
few
times
and
though
the
needle
occasionally
swayed
a
little
it
was
not
affected
in
any
marked
manner
the
effect
of
the
electrical
waves
on
me
became
less
as
i
descended
but
whether
from
my
getting
below
the
electrical
stratum
or
from
a
cessation
of
the
current
i
can
not
say
but
i
did
not
descend
much
below
eleven
thousand
feet
and
at
the
lowest
point
i
crossed
the
south
poudre
at
the
outlet
of
poudre
lakes
in
crossing
i
broke
through
the
ice
and
received
a
wetting
with
the
exception
of
my
right
side
above
the
hip
once
across
i
walked
about
two
hundred
yards
through
an
opening
then
again
entered
the
woods
on
the
southeasterly
slope
of
specimen
mountain
i
had
climbed
only
a
short
distance
up
this
slope
when
another
electrical
wave
struck
me
the
effect
of
this
was
similar
to
that
of
the
preceding
ones
there
was
however
a
marked
difference
in
the
intensity
with
which
the
electricity
affected
the
wet
and
the
dry
portions
of
my
body
the
effect
on
my
right
side
and
shoulder
which
had
escaped
wetting
when
i
broke
through
the
ice
was
noticeably
stronger
than
on
the
rest
of
my
body
climbing
soon
dried
my
clothes
sufficiently
to
make
this
difference
no
longer
noticeable
the
waves
became
more
frequent
than
at
first
but
not
so
strong
i
made
a
clumsy
climb
of
about
five
hundred
feet
my
muscles
being
all
the
time
with
rigidity
from
electricity
but
this
climb
brought
me
almost
to
on
specimen
mountain
and
also
under
the
shadow
of
the
south
peak
of
it
at
this
place
the
electrical
effects
almost
ceased
nor
did
i
again
seriously
feel
the
current
until
i
found
myself
out
in
the
sunlight
which
came
between
the
two
peaks
of
specimen
while
i
continued
in
the
sunlight
i
felt
the
electrical
wave
but
strange
to
say
when
i
again
entered
the
shadow
i
almost
wholly
escaped
it
when
i
started
on
the
last
slope
toward
the
top
of
north
specimen
i
came
out
into
the
sunlight
again
and
i
also
passed
into
an
electrical
sea
the
slope
was
free
from
snow
and
as
the
electrical
waves
swept
in
close
succession
about
thirty
seconds
apart
they
snapped
hummed
and
buzzed
in
such
a
manner
that
their
advance
and
retreat
could
be
plainly
heard
in
passing
by
me
the
noise
was
more
of
a
crackling
and
humming
nature
while
a
million
faint
sparks
flashed
from
the
stones
porphyry
and
rhyolite
as
the
wave
passed
over
but
the
effect
on
me
became
constant
every
muscle
was
almost
immovable
i
could
climb
only
a
few
steps
without
weakening
to
the
i
breathed
only
by
gasps
and
my
heart
became
violent
and
feeble
by
turns
i
felt
as
if
cinched
in
a
steel
corset
after
i
had
spent
ten
long
minutes
and
was
only
up
a
slope
the
entire
length
of
which
i
had
more
than
once
climbed
in
a
few
minutes
and
in
fine
shape
i
turned
to
retreat
but
as
there
was
no
cessation
of
the
electrical
colic
i
faced
about
and
started
up
again
i
reached
the
top
a
few
minutes
before
and
shortly
afterward
the
sun
disappeared
behind
clouds
and
peaks
i
regret
that
i
failed
to
notice
whether
the
electrical
effects
ceased
with
the
setting
of
the
sun
but
it
was
not
long
after
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
before
i
was
at
ease
enjoying
the
magnificent
of
clouds
that
had
formed
above
the
foothills
and
stood
up
glorious
in
the
sunlight
shortly
before
five
the
clouds
had
begun
to
pile
up
in
the
east
and
their
gigantic
forms
flowing
outlines
and
glorious
lighting
were
the
only
things
that
caused
the
electrical
effects
to
be
forgotten
even
momentarily
the
clouds
formed
into
a
long
solid
rounded
range
that
rose
to
great
height
and
was
miles
in
length
the
southern
end
of
this
range
was
in
the
haze
and
i
could
not
make
out
its
outline
further
south
than
a
point
about
opposite
loveland
colorado
nor
could
i
see
the
northern
end
beyond
a
few
miles
north
of
cheyenne
where
it
was
cut
off
by
a
dozen
strata
of
low
clouds
that
moved
steadily
at
a
right
angle
to
the
east
sixty
miles
of
length
was
visible
its
height
like
that
of
the
real
mountains
which
it
paralleled
diminished
toward
the
north
the
place
of
greatest
altitude
was
about
miles
distant
from
me
from
my
location
the
clouds
presented
a
long
and
smoothly
terraced
slope
the
top
of
which
was
at
least
five
thousand
feet
and
may
have
been
fifteen
thousand
feet
above
me
the
clouds
seemed
compact
at
times
they
surged
upwards
then
they
would
settle
with
a
long
undulating
swell
as
if
some
unseen
power
were
trying
to
force
them
further
up
the
mountains
while
they
were
afraid
to
try
it
finally
a
series
of
low
conical
peaks
rose
on
the
summit
of
the
and
the
peaks
and
the
upper
resembled
the
upper
portion
of
a
there
were
no
rough
places
or
angles
when
darkness
came
on
the
surface
of
this
was
at
times
splendidly
illuminated
by
electricity
beneath
and
when
the
darkness
deepened
the
electrical
play
beneath
often
caused
the
surface
to
shine
momentarily
like
incandescent
glass
and
occasionally
sinuous
rivers
of
gold
ran
over
the
slopes
several
times
i
thought
that
the
course
of
these
golden
rivers
of
electrical
fire
was
from
the
bottom
upward
but
so
brilliant
and
dazzling
were
they
that
i
could
not
positively
decide
on
the
direction
of
their
movement
never
have
i
seen
such
enormous
or
such
brilliant
electrical
effects
the
summit
of
specimen
mountain
from
which
i
watched
the
clouds
and
electrical
flashes
is
about
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
a
calm
prevailed
while
i
remained
on
top
it
was
about
when
i
left
the
summit
on
snowshoes
and
swept
down
the
steep
northern
slope
into
the
woods
this
hurry
caused
no
unusual
heart
or
muscle
action
the
next
morning
was
cloudy
as
low
down
as
ten
thousand
five
hundred
feet
and
for
all
i
know
lower
still
the
night
had
been
warm
and
the
morning
had
the
oppressive
feeling
that
dominated
the
morning
before
the
clouds
broke
up
before
nine
and
the
air
with
haze
in
it
seemed
yellow
about
haze
and
soon
after
clouds
came
in
from
the
southeast
at
this
time
i
was
high
up
on
the
southerly
slope
of
mt
richthofen
and
by
eleven
the
sky
was
cloudy
up
to
this
time
the
air
when
my
were
off
burned
and
twitched
my
eyes
in
the
same
manner
as
on
the
previous
morning
early
in
the
afternoon
i
left
grand
ditch
camp
and
started
down
to
chambers
lake
i
had
not
gone
far
when
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
from
time
to
time
and
shortly
after
this
my
muscles
began
to
twitch
occasionally
under
electrical
ticklings
at
times
slight
muscular
rigidity
was
noticeable
just
before
two
the
clouds
began
to
burst
through
between
the
trees
i
was
at
an
altitude
of
about
eleven
thousand
feet
and
a
short
distance
from
the
head
of
trap
creek
rain
hail
and
snow
fell
in
turn
and
the
lightning
began
frequently
to
strike
the
rocks
with
the
beginning
of
the
lightning
my
muscles
ceased
to
be
troubled
with
either
twitching
or
rigidity
for
the
two
hours
between
and
the
crash
and
roll
of
thunder
was
incessant
i
counted
times
that
the
lightning
struck
the
rocks
but
i
did
not
see
it
strike
a
tree
the
clouds
were
low
and
the
wind
came
from
the
east
and
the
northeast
then
from
the
west
illustration
a
storm
on
the
rockies
about
four
i
broke
through
the
snow
tumbled
into
trap
creek
and
had
to
swim
a
little
this
stream
was
really
very
swift
and
ran
in
a
narrow
gulch
but
it
was
blocked
by
snow
and
by
swept
down
by
the
flood
and
a
pond
had
been
formed
it
was
crowded
with
a
deep
deposit
of
snow
which
rested
on
a
shelf
of
ice
this
covering
was
shattered
and
uplifted
by
the
swollen
stream
and
i
had
slipped
on
the
top
of
the
gulch
and
tumbled
in
once
in
the
swift
water
tugged
at
me
to
pull
me
under
the
cakes
of
snow
and
ice
hampered
me
and
my
snowshoes
were
entangled
with
brush
and
limbs
the
combination
seemed
determined
to
drown
me
for
a
few
seconds
i
put
forth
all
my
efforts
to
get
at
my
this
accomplished
the
fastenings
of
my
snowshoes
were
cut
and
unhampered
by
these
i
escaped
the
waters
since
i
have
felt
no
ill
results
the
effect
of
the
entire
experience
may
have
been
beneficial
the
clouds
glorious
as
they
had
been
in
formation
and
coloring
resulted
in
a
terrible
cloudburst
enormous
quantities
of
water
were
poured
out
and
this
falling
upon
the
treeless
foothills
rushed
away
to
do
more
than
a
million
damage
in
the
rich
and
beautiful
poudre
valley
climbing
long
peak
among
the
best
days
that
i
have
had
outdoors
are
the
two
hundred
and
that
were
spent
as
a
guide
on
long
peak
one
day
was
required
from
the
near
my
cabin
for
each
round
trip
to
the
summit
of
the
peak
something
of
interest
occurred
to
enliven
each
one
of
these
climbs
a
storm
an
accident
the
wit
of
some
one
or
the
enthusiasm
of
all
the
climbers
but
the
climb
i
remember
with
greatest
satisfaction
is
the
one
on
which
i
guided
harriet
peters
an
girl
to
the
top
it
was
a
cold
morning
when
we
started
for
the
top
but
it
was
this
day
or
wait
until
next
season
for
harriet
was
to
start
for
her
southern
home
in
a
day
or
two
and
could
not
wait
for
a
more
favorable
morning
harriet
had
spent
the
two
preceding
summers
near
my
cabin
and
around
it
had
played
with
the
chipmunks
and
ridden
the
burros
and
she
had
made
a
few
climbs
with
me
up
through
the
woods
we
often
talked
of
going
to
the
top
of
long
peak
when
she
should
become
strong
enough
to
do
so
this
time
came
just
after
her
eighth
birthday
as
i
was
as
eager
to
have
her
make
the
climb
as
she
was
to
make
it
we
started
up
the
next
morning
after
her
aunt
had
given
permission
for
her
to
go
she
was
happy
when
i
lifted
her
at
last
into
the
saddle
away
up
on
old
top
back
she
was
so
small
that
i
still
wonder
how
she
managed
to
stay
on
but
she
did
so
easily
long
peak
is
not
only
one
of
the
most
scenic
of
the
peaks
in
the
rocky
mountains
but
it
is
probably
the
most
rugged
from
our
it
was
seven
miles
to
the
top
five
of
these
miles
may
be
ridden
but
the
last
two
are
so
steep
and
craggy
that
one
must
go
on
foot
and
climb
illustration
long
peak
from
the
summit
of
mt
meeker
after
riding
a
little
more
than
a
mile
we
came
to
a
clear
cold
brook
that
is
ever
coming
down
in
a
great
hurry
over
a
steep
splashing
jumping
and
falling
over
the
boulders
of
one
of
stony
stairways
and
forming
white
cascades
which
throw
their
spray
among
the
tall
dark
pines
i
had
told
harriet
that
ouzels
lived
by
this
brook
she
was
eager
to
see
one
and
we
stopped
at
a
promising
place
by
the
brook
to
watch
in
less
than
a
minute
one
came
flying
down
the
cascades
and
so
near
to
the
surface
of
the
water
that
he
seemed
to
be
tumbling
and
sliding
down
with
it
he
alighted
on
a
boulder
near
us
made
two
or
three
pleasant
curtsies
and
started
to
sing
one
of
his
low
sweet
songs
he
was
doing
the
very
thing
of
which
i
had
so
often
told
harriet
we
watched
and
listened
with
breathless
interest
in
the
midst
of
the
song
he
dived
into
the
brook
in
a
moment
he
came
up
with
a
in
his
bill
settled
on
the
boulder
again
gave
his
nods
and
resumed
his
song
seemingly
at
the
point
where
he
left
off
after
a
few
low
sweet
notes
he
broke
off
again
and
plunged
into
the
water
this
time
he
came
up
quickly
and
alighted
on
the
spot
he
had
just
left
and
went
on
with
his
song
without
any
preliminaries
and
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
the
is
found
by
the
alpine
lakes
and
brooks
on
the
mountains
of
the
west
it
is
a
bird
about
the
size
of
a
thrush
and
wears
a
plain
dress
of
slaty
blue
this
dress
is
finished
with
a
somewhat
like
that
of
the
wren
though
it
is
not
upturned
so
much
the
bird
seems
to
love
cascades
and
often
nests
by
one
it
also
shows
its
fondness
for
water
by
often
flying
along
the
brook
following
every
bend
and
break
made
by
the
stream
keeping
close
to
the
water
all
the
time
and
frequently
touching
it
over
the
quiet
reaches
it
goes
skimming
it
plunges
over
the
waterfalls
alights
on
rocks
in
the
rapids
goes
dashing
through
the
spray
its
every
movement
showing
the
ecstasies
of
eager
life
and
joy
in
the
hurrying
water
our
ouzel
was
quietly
feeding
on
the
edge
of
the
brook
when
harriet
said
as
our
ponies
started
up
the
trail
harriet
had
never
been
in
school
but
she
could
read
write
and
sing
she
had
good
health
and
a
brighter
cheerier
little
girl
i
have
never
seen
as
we
rode
up
the
trail
through
the
woods
the
gray
douglas
squirrels
were
busy
with
the
harvest
they
were
cutting
off
and
storing
cones
for
winter
food
in
the
treetops
these
squirrels
seemed
to
be
bouncing
and
darting
in
all
directions
one
would
cut
off
a
cone
then
dart
to
the
next
and
so
swiftly
that
cones
were
constantly
dropping
frequently
the
cones
struck
limbs
and
bounded
as
they
fell
often
coming
to
the
ground
to
bounce
and
roll
some
distance
over
the
forest
floor
an
occasional
one
went
rolling
and
bouncing
down
the
steep
with
two
or
three
happy
chipmunks
in
jolly
pursuit
we
watched
one
squirrel
stow
cones
under
trash
and
in
holes
in
the
thick
beds
of
needles
these
cones
were
buried
near
a
tree
in
a
dead
limb
of
which
the
squirrel
had
a
hole
and
a
home
harriet
asked
many
questions
concerning
the
cones
why
they
were
buried
how
the
squirrel
found
them
when
they
were
buried
in
the
snow
and
what
became
of
those
which
were
left
buried
i
told
her
that
during
the
winter
the
squirrel
came
down
and
dug
through
the
snow
to
the
cones
and
then
fed
upon
the
nuts
i
also
told
her
that
squirrels
usually
buried
more
cones
than
were
eaten
the
uneaten
cones
being
left
in
the
ground
were
in
a
way
planted
and
the
nuts
in
them
in
time
sprouted
and
young
trees
came
peeping
up
among
the
fallen
leaves
the
way
of
observing
arbor
day
makes
him
a
useful
forester
harriet
said
she
would
tell
all
her
boy
and
girl
friends
what
she
knew
of
this
squirrel
ways
and
would
ask
her
uncle
not
to
shoot
the
little
as
we
followed
the
trail
up
through
the
woods
i
told
harriet
many
things
concerning
the
trees
and
the
forces
which
influenced
their
distribution
and
growth
while
we
were
traveling
westward
in
the
bottom
of
a
gulch
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
trees
on
the
mountain
that
rose
on
the
right
and
sloped
toward
the
south
were
of
a
different
kind
from
those
on
the
which
rose
on
our
left
and
sloped
toward
the
north
after
traveling
four
miles
and
climbing
up
two
thousand
feet
above
our
and
after
from
time
to
time
coming
to
and
passing
kinds
of
trees
which
did
not
grow
lower
down
the
slopes
we
at
last
came
to
above
which
trees
did
not
grow
at
all
in
north
america
between
on
the
rockies
at
an
altitude
of
about
eleven
thousand
feet
and
on
the
florida
coast
there
are
about
six
hundred
and
twenty
kinds
of
trees
and
shrubs
growing
each
kind
usually
grows
in
the
soil
and
clime
that
is
best
suited
to
its
requirements
in
other
words
most
trees
are
growing
where
they
can
do
the
best
or
where
they
can
do
better
than
any
other
kind
some
trees
do
the
best
at
the
moist
seashore
some
thrive
in
swamps
others
live
only
on
the
desert
edge
some
live
on
the
edge
of
a
river
and
still
others
manage
to
endure
the
storms
of
bleak
heights
at
the
trees
have
a
hard
time
of
it
all
of
them
at
this
place
are
dwarfed
many
distorted
some
crushed
to
the
earth
flattened
out
upon
the
ground
like
pressed
flowers
by
the
snowdrifts
that
have
so
long
lain
upon
them
the
winter
winds
at
this
place
blow
almost
constantly
from
the
same
quarter
for
days
at
a
time
and
often
attain
a
high
velocity
the
effect
of
these
winds
is
strikingly
shown
by
the
trees
none
of
the
trees
are
tall
and
most
of
them
are
leaning
pushed
partly
over
by
the
wind
some
are
sprawled
on
the
ground
like
uncouth
vines
or
spread
out
from
the
stump
like
a
fan
with
the
onsweeping
direction
of
the
storms
most
of
the
standing
unsheltered
trees
have
limbs
only
on
the
leeward
quarter
all
the
other
limbs
having
been
blown
off
by
the
wind
or
cut
off
by
the
gravel
most
of
the
exposed
trees
are
destitute
of
bark
on
the
portion
of
the
trunk
that
faces
these
winter
winds
some
of
the
dead
standing
trees
are
carved
into
strange
by
the
of
many
fierce
storms
with
all
the
trees
warped
or
distorted
the
effect
of
is
weird
and
strange
harriet
and
i
got
off
the
ponies
the
better
to
examine
some
of
the
trees
harriet
was
attracted
to
a
few
dwarf
spruces
that
were
standing
in
a
drift
of
recently
fallen
snow
although
these
dwarfed
little
trees
were
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
they
were
so
short
that
the
little
who
stood
by
them
was
taller
than
they
after
stroking
one
of
the
trees
with
her
hand
harriet
stood
for
a
time
in
silence
then
out
of
her
warm
childish
nature
she
said
what
brave
little
trees
to
live
up
here
where
they
have
to
stand
all
the
time
in
the
snow
with
its
strange
tree
statuary
and
treeless
snowy
peaks
and
crags
rising
above
it
together
with
its
many
kinds
of
bird
and
animal
life
and
its
snowdrifts
is
one
of
nature
most
expressive
exhibits
and
i
wish
every
one
might
visit
it
at
an
altitude
of
about
eleven
thousand
seven
hundred
feet
we
came
to
the
last
tree
it
was
ragged
and
so
small
that
you
could
have
hidden
it
beneath
a
hat
it
nestled
up
to
a
boulder
and
appeared
so
cold
and
pitiful
that
harriet
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
lost
it
certainly
appeared
as
if
it
had
been
lost
for
a
long
long
time
among
the
crags
harriet
and
i
kept
sharp
watch
for
mountain
sheep
but
we
did
not
see
any
we
were
fortunate
enough
however
to
see
a
flock
of
ptarmigan
these
birds
were
huddled
in
a
hole
which
narrowly
escaped
being
trampled
on
by
top
they
walked
quietly
away
and
we
had
a
good
look
at
them
they
were
almost
white
in
winter
they
are
pure
white
while
in
summer
they
are
of
a
grayish
brown
at
all
times
their
dress
matches
the
surroundings
fairly
well
so
that
they
have
a
protective
coloring
which
makes
it
difficult
for
their
enemies
to
see
them
at
an
altitude
of
twelve
thousand
five
hundred
feet
the
horses
were
tied
to
boulders
and
left
behind
from
this
place
to
the
top
of
the
peak
the
way
is
too
rough
or
precipitous
for
horses
for
a
mile
harriet
and
i
went
forward
over
the
boulders
of
an
old
moraine
the
last
was
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
way
was
steep
and
broken
and
was
entirely
over
rocks
which
were
covered
with
a
few
inches
of
snow
that
had
fallen
during
the
night
we
climbed
slowly
all
good
climbers
go
slowly
harriet
also
faithfully
followed
another
good
mountain
rule
look
before
you
step
she
did
not
fall
slip
or
stumble
while
making
the
climb
of
course
we
occasionally
rested
and
whenever
we
stopped
near
a
flat
rock
or
a
level
place
we
made
use
of
it
by
lying
down
on
our
backs
straightening
out
arms
and
legs
relaxing
every
muscle
and
for
a
time
resting
as
loosely
as
possible
just
before
reaching
the
top
we
made
a
long
climb
through
the
deepest
snow
that
we
had
encountered
though
the
sun
was
warm
the
air
rocks
and
snow
were
cold
not
only
was
the
snow
cold
to
the
feet
but
climbing
through
it
was
tiresome
and
at
the
first
convenient
place
we
stopped
to
rest
finding
a
large
smooth
rock
we
lay
down
on
our
backs
side
by
side
we
talked
for
a
time
and
watched
an
eagle
soaring
around
up
in
the
blue
sky
i
think
harriet
must
have
recalled
a
suggestion
which
i
made
at
for
without
moving
she
suddenly
remarked
mills
my
feet
are
so
cold
that
i
ca
tell
whether
my
toes
are
wiggling
or
not
five
hours
after
starting
harriet
stepped
upon
the
top
the
youngest
climber
to
scale
long
peak
the
top
is
fourteen
thousand
two
hundred
and
feet
above
the
sea
is
almost
level
and
though
rough
is
roomy
enough
for
a
baseball
game
of
course
if
the
ball
went
over
the
edge
it
would
tumble
a
mile
or
so
before
stopping
with
the
top
so
large
you
will
realize
that
the
base
measures
miles
across
the
upper
three
thousand
feet
of
the
peak
is
but
a
gigantic
mass
almost
destitute
of
soil
or
vegetation
some
of
the
rocks
are
flecked
and
spotted
with
lichens
and
a
few
patches
of
moss
and
straggling
beautiful
alpine
flowers
can
be
found
during
august
there
is
but
little
chance
for
snow
to
lodge
and
for
nearly
three
thousand
feet
the
peak
rises
a
bald
broken
impressive
stone
tower
while
harriet
and
i
were
eating
luncheon
a
that
i
had
fed
on
other
visits
came
out
to
see
if
there
was
anything
for
him
some
sparrows
also
lighted
near
they
looked
hungry
so
we
left
some
bread
for
them
and
then
climbed
upon
the
where
our
picture
was
taken
from
the
we
could
see
more
than
a
hundred
miles
toward
any
point
of
the
compass
west
of
us
we
saw
several
streams
that
were
flowing
away
toward
the
pacific
east
of
us
the
streams
flowed
to
the
atlantic
i
told
harriet
that
the
many
small
streams
we
saw
all
grew
larger
as
they
neared
the
sea
harriet
lived
at
the
big
end
of
the
arkansas
river
she
suddenly
wanted
to
know
if
i
could
show
her
the
little
end
of
the
arkansas
river
illustration
on
the
of
long
peak
after
an
hour
on
top
we
started
downward
and
homeward
the
little
feeling
happy
and
lively
but
she
was
careful
and
only
once
during
the
day
did
she
slip
and
this
slip
was
hardly
her
fault
we
were
coming
off
an
enormous
smooth
boulder
that
was
wet
from
the
new
snow
that
was
melting
when
both
harriet
feet
shot
from
under
her
and
she
fell
laughing
into
my
arms
hello
top
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
harriet
when
we
came
to
the
horses
while
riding
homeward
i
told
harriet
that
i
had
often
climbed
the
peak
by
moonlight
on
the
way
down
she
said
to
the
little
trees
at
the
squirrels
and
the
ouzel
when
i
at
last
lifted
harriet
off
old
top
at
the
cabin
many
people
came
out
to
greet
her
to
all
she
said
yes
i
tired
but
some
time
i
want
to
go
up
by
moonlight
midget
the
return
horse
in
many
of
the
western
the
liverymen
keep
return
horses
horses
that
will
return
to
the
barn
when
set
at
liberty
whether
near
the
barn
or
twenty
miles
away
these
horses
are
the
pick
of
their
kind
they
have
brains
enough
to
take
training
readily
and
also
to
make
plans
of
their
own
and
get
on
despite
the
unexpected
hindrances
that
sometimes
occur
when
a
return
horse
is
ridden
to
a
neighboring
town
he
must
know
enough
to
find
his
way
back
and
he
must
also
be
so
well
trained
that
he
will
not
converse
too
long
with
the
horse
he
meets
going
in
the
opposite
direction
the
return
horse
is
a
result
of
the
necessities
of
mountain
sections
especially
the
needs
of
miners
most
western
are
located
upon
a
flat
or
in
a
gulch
the
mines
are
rarely
near
the
town
but
are
on
the
above
it
out
of
town
go
a
dozen
roads
or
trails
that
extend
to
the
mines
from
one
to
five
miles
away
and
much
higher
than
the
town
a
miner
does
not
mind
walking
down
to
the
town
but
he
wants
to
ride
back
or
the
prospector
comes
in
and
wants
to
take
back
a
few
supplies
the
miner
hires
a
return
horse
rides
it
to
the
mine
and
then
turns
the
horse
loose
it
at
once
starts
to
return
to
the
barn
if
a
horse
meets
a
freight
wagon
coming
up
it
must
hunt
for
a
turnout
if
the
road
is
narrow
and
give
the
wagon
the
right
of
way
if
the
horse
meets
some
one
walking
up
it
must
avoid
being
caught
the
san
juan
mining
section
of
southwestern
colorado
has
hundreds
of
these
horses
most
of
the
mines
are
from
one
thousand
to
three
thousand
feet
above
the
main
ouray
telluride
and
silverton
ouray
and
telluride
are
not
far
apart
by
trail
but
they
are
separated
by
a
rugged
range
that
rises
more
than
three
thousand
feet
above
them
men
often
go
by
trail
from
one
of
these
towns
to
the
other
and
in
so
doing
usually
ride
a
return
horse
to
the
top
of
the
range
then
walk
down
the
other
side
illustration
a
miner
on
a
return
horse
be
sure
to
turn
jim
loose
before
you
reach
the
summit
he
come
back
if
you
ride
him
even
a
short
distance
on
the
other
side
called
a
telluride
liveryman
to
me
as
i
rode
out
of
his
barn
it
seems
that
the
most
faithful
return
horse
may
not
come
back
if
ridden
far
down
the
slope
away
from
home
but
may
stray
down
it
rather
than
climb
again
to
the
summit
to
return
home
the
rider
is
warned
also
to
fasten
up
the
reins
and
see
that
the
cinches
are
tight
when
he
turns
the
horse
loose
if
the
cinches
are
loose
the
saddle
may
turn
when
the
horse
rolls
or
if
the
reins
are
down
the
horse
may
graze
for
hours
either
loose
reins
or
loose
cinches
may
cripple
a
horse
by
entangling
his
feet
or
by
catching
on
a
snag
in
the
woods
once
loose
the
horse
generally
starts
off
home
on
a
trot
but
he
is
not
always
faithful
when
a
number
of
these
horses
are
together
they
will
occasionally
play
too
long
on
the
way
a
great
liking
for
grass
sometimes
tempts
them
into
a
ditch
where
they
may
eat
grass
even
though
the
reins
are
up
the
lot
of
a
return
horse
is
generally
a
hard
one
a
usurper
occasionally
catches
a
horse
and
rides
him
far
away
then
too
often
his
owner
blames
him
for
the
delay
and
for
a
time
gives
him
only
to
teach
him
not
to
fool
along
generally
the
return
horse
must
also
be
a
good
snow
horse
able
to
flounder
and
willing
to
make
his
way
through
deep
drifts
he
may
be
thirsty
on
a
warm
day
but
he
must
go
all
the
way
home
before
having
a
drink
often
in
winter
he
is
turned
loose
at
night
on
some
bleak
height
to
go
back
over
a
lonely
trail
a
task
which
he
does
not
like
horses
like
most
animals
and
like
man
are
not
at
ease
when
alone
a
fallen
tree
across
the
trail
or
deepened
snow
sometimes
makes
the
horse
return
journey
a
hard
one
on
rare
occasions
cinch
or
bridle
gets
caught
on
a
snag
or
around
his
legs
and
cripples
him
or
entangles
him
so
that
he
falls
a
victim
to
the
unpitying
mountain
lion
or
some
other
carnivorous
animal
i
have
never
met
a
return
horse
without
stopping
to
watch
it
as
far
as
it
could
be
seen
they
always
go
along
with
such
unconscious
confidence
and
quiet
alertness
that
they
are
a
delight
to
behold
many
good
days
i
have
had
in
their
company
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
their
alertness
skill
and
strength
have
saved
me
either
from
injury
or
from
the
clutches
of
that
great
white
terror
the
the
february
morning
that
i
rode
midget
out
of
alma
began
what
proved
to
be
by
far
the
most
delightful
association
that
i
have
ever
had
with
a
return
horse
and
one
of
the
happiest
experiences
with
nature
and
a
dumb
animal
that
has
ever
come
into
my
life
i
was
in
government
experiment
work
as
state
snow
observer
and
wanted
to
make
some
observations
on
the
summit
peaks
of
the
and
other
ranges
midget
was
to
carry
me
far
up
the
side
of
these
mountains
to
the
summit
of
hoosier
pass
a
heavy
snow
had
fallen
a
few
days
before
i
started
out
the
wind
had
drifted
most
of
this
out
of
the
open
and
piled
it
deeply
in
the
woods
and
gulches
midget
galloped
merrily
away
over
the
ground
we
came
to
a
gulch
i
know
not
how
deep
that
was
filled
with
snow
and
here
i
began
to
appreciate
midget
across
this
gulch
it
was
necessary
for
us
to
go
the
snow
was
so
deep
and
so
soft
that
i
dismounted
and
put
on
my
snowshoes
and
started
to
lead
midget
across
she
followed
willingly
after
a
few
steps
a
flounder
and
a
snort
caused
me
to
look
back
and
all
i
could
see
of
midget
was
her
two
little
ears
wriggling
in
the
snow
when
we
reached
the
other
side
midget
came
out
breathing
heavily
and
at
once
shook
her
head
to
dislodge
the
snow
from
her
forehead
and
her
ears
she
was
impatient
to
go
on
and
before
i
could
take
off
my
snowshoes
and
strap
them
on
my
back
she
was
pawing
the
ground
impatiently
first
with
one
little
fore
foot
and
then
with
the
other
i
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
away
we
went
again
we
had
a
very
pleasant
morning
of
it
about
eleven
i
dismounted
to
take
a
picture
of
the
snowy
slope
of
mt
silverheels
evidently
midget
had
never
before
seen
a
kodak
she
watched
with
extraordinary
interest
the
standing
of
the
little
affair
upon
the
ground
and
the
mounting
of
the
small
black
box
upon
it
she
pointed
her
ears
at
it
tilted
her
head
to
one
side
and
moved
her
nose
up
and
down
i
moved
away
from
her
several
feet
to
take
the
picture
she
eyed
the
kodak
with
such
intentness
that
i
invited
her
to
come
over
and
have
a
look
at
it
she
came
at
once
turning
her
head
and
neck
to
one
side
to
prevent
the
which
i
had
thrown
upon
the
ground
from
entangling
her
feet
once
by
me
she
looked
the
kodak
and
tripod
over
with
interest
smelled
of
them
but
was
careful
not
to
strike
the
tripod
with
her
feet
or
to
overturn
it
and
the
kodak
with
her
nose
she
seemed
so
interested
that
i
told
her
all
about
what
i
was
doing
what
i
was
taking
a
picture
of
why
i
was
taking
it
and
how
long
an
exposure
i
was
going
to
give
it
and
finally
i
said
to
her
midget
when
you
are
back
in
your
stall
in
the
barn
at
alma
eating
oats
i
shall
be
on
the
other
side
of
mt
silverheels
taking
pictures
there
do
you
understand
she
pawed
the
ground
with
her
right
fore
foot
with
such
a
satisfied
look
upon
her
face
that
i
was
sure
she
thought
she
understood
all
about
it
from
time
to
time
i
took
other
pictures
and
after
the
first
experience
midget
did
not
wait
to
be
invited
to
come
over
and
watch
me
but
always
followed
me
to
every
new
spot
where
i
set
the
tripod
and
kodak
down
and
on
each
occasion
i
talked
freely
with
her
and
she
seemed
to
understand
and
to
be
much
interested
shortly
after
noon
when
i
was
taking
a
picture
midget
managed
to
get
her
nose
into
my
mammoth
outside
there
she
found
something
to
her
liking
it
was
my
habit
to
eat
lightly
when
rambling
about
the
mountains
often
eating
only
once
a
day
and
occasionally
going
two
or
three
days
without
food
i
had
a
few
friends
who
were
concerned
about
me
and
who
were
afraid
i
might
some
time
starve
to
death
so
partly
as
a
joke
and
partly
in
earnest
they
would
mail
me
a
package
of
something
to
eat
whenever
they
knew
at
what
i
was
likely
to
turn
up
at
alma
the
morning
i
hired
midget
the
prize
package
which
i
drew
from
the
contained
salted
peanuts
i
did
not
care
for
them
but
put
them
into
my
pocket
it
was
past
noon
and
midget
was
hungry
i
was
chattering
away
to
her
about
when
feeling
her
rubbing
me
with
her
nose
i
put
my
hand
around
to
find
that
she
was
eating
salted
peanuts
from
my
big
midget
enjoyed
them
so
much
that
i
allowed
her
to
put
her
nose
into
my
pocket
and
help
herself
and
from
time
to
time
too
i
gave
her
a
handful
of
them
until
they
were
all
gone
late
in
the
afternoon
midget
and
i
arrived
at
the
top
of
hoosier
pass
i
told
her
to
look
tired
and
i
would
take
her
picture
she
dropped
her
head
and
neck
a
little
and
there
on
the
pass
with
the
peaks
in
the
background
i
photographed
her
then
i
told
her
it
was
time
to
go
home
that
it
was
sure
to
be
after
dark
before
she
could
get
back
so
i
tightened
the
cinches
fastened
up
the
over
the
horn
of
the
saddle
and
told
her
to
go
she
looked
around
at
me
but
did
not
move
evidently
she
preferred
to
stay
with
me
so
i
spoke
to
her
sternly
and
said
midget
you
will
have
to
go
home
without
even
looking
round
she
kicked
up
her
heels
and
trotted
speedily
down
the
mountain
and
disappeared
i
did
not
imagine
that
we
would
meet
again
for
some
time
i
went
on
and
at
on
mt
lincoln
i
built
a
and
without
bedding
spent
the
night
by
it
the
next
day
i
climbed
several
peaks
took
many
photographs
measured
many
snowdrifts
and
made
many
notes
in
my
notebook
when
night
came
on
i
descended
from
the
crags
and
snows
into
the
woods
built
a
fire
and
spent
the
night
by
it
sleeping
for
a
little
while
at
a
time
awakening
with
the
cold
i
would
get
up
and
revive
my
fire
and
then
lie
down
to
sleep
the
next
day
a
severe
storm
came
on
and
i
was
compelled
to
huddle
by
my
fire
all
day
for
the
wind
was
so
fierce
and
the
snow
so
blinding
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
risky
to
try
to
cross
the
craggy
and
slippery
all
that
day
i
stayed
by
the
fire
but
that
night
instead
of
trying
to
get
a
little
sleep
there
i
crawled
into
a
newly
formed
snowdrift
and
in
it
slept
soundly
and
quite
comfortably
until
morning
toward
noon
the
storm
ceased
but
it
had
delayed
me
a
day
i
had
brought
with
me
only
a
pound
of
raisins
and
had
eaten
these
during
the
first
two
days
i
felt
rather
hungry
and
almost
wished
i
had
saved
some
of
the
salted
peanuts
that
i
had
given
midget
but
i
felt
fresh
and
vigorous
and
joyfully
i
made
my
way
over
the
snowy
crest
of
the
continent
late
that
night
i
came
into
the
of
leadville
at
the
hotel
i
found
letters
and
a
telegram
awaiting
me
this
telegram
told
me
that
it
was
important
for
me
to
come
to
the
pike
peak
national
forest
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
after
a
light
supper
and
an
hour
rest
i
again
tied
on
my
snowshoes
and
at
midnight
started
to
climb
the
newly
fallen
snow
on
the
steep
was
soft
and
fluffy
i
sank
so
deeply
into
it
and
made
such
slow
progress
that
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
before
i
reached
on
the
other
side
the
london
mine
lay
a
little
off
my
course
and
knowing
that
miners
frequently
rode
return
horses
up
to
it
i
thought
that
by
going
to
the
mine
i
might
secure
a
return
horse
to
carry
me
back
to
alma
which
was
about
thirteen
miles
away
with
this
in
mind
i
started
off
in
a
hurry
in
my
haste
i
caught
one
of
my
webbed
shoes
on
the
top
of
a
gnarly
tree
that
was
buried
and
hidden
in
the
snow
i
fell
or
rather
dived
into
the
snow
and
in
so
doing
broke
a
snowshoe
and
lost
my
hat
this
affair
delayed
me
a
little
and
i
gave
up
going
to
the
mine
but
concluded
to
go
to
the
trail
about
a
mile
below
it
and
there
intercept
the
first
return
horse
that
came
down
just
before
i
reached
the
trail
i
heard
a
horse
coming
as
this
trail
was
constantly
used
the
snow
was
packed
down
while
the
untrampled
snow
on
each
side
of
it
lay
from
two
to
four
feet
deep
seeing
that
this
pony
was
going
to
get
past
before
i
could
reach
the
trail
i
stopped
took
a
breath
and
called
out
to
it
when
i
said
hello
pony
the
pony
did
not
hello
instead
of
slackening
its
pace
it
seemed
to
increase
it
knowing
that
this
trail
was
one
that
midget
had
often
to
cover
i
concluded
as
a
forlorn
hope
to
call
her
name
thinking
that
the
pony
might
be
midget
so
i
called
out
hello
midget
the
pony
at
once
stopped
looked
all
around
and
gave
a
delighted
little
whinny
it
was
midget
the
instant
she
saw
me
she
tried
to
climb
up
out
of
the
trail
into
the
deep
snow
where
i
was
but
i
hastened
to
prevent
her
leaping
down
by
her
side
i
put
my
arm
around
her
neck
and
told
her
that
i
was
very
glad
to
see
her
and
that
i
wanted
to
ride
to
alma
her
nose
found
its
way
into
my
well
midget
it
is
too
bad
really
i
was
not
expecting
to
see
you
and
i
have
a
single
salted
peanut
but
if
you
will
just
allow
me
to
ride
this
long
thirteen
miles
into
alma
i
will
give
you
all
the
salted
peanuts
that
you
will
be
allowed
to
eat
i
am
tired
and
should
very
much
like
to
have
a
ride
will
you
take
me
she
at
once
started
to
paw
the
snowy
trail
with
a
small
fore
foot
as
much
as
to
say
hurry
up
i
took
off
my
snowshoes
and
without
waiting
to
fasten
them
on
my
back
jumped
into
the
saddle
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
and
with
loud
stamping
on
the
floor
midget
carried
me
into
the
livery
barn
at
alma
when
her
owner
saw
a
man
in
the
saddle
he
was
angry
and
reminded
me
that
it
was
unfair
and
illegal
to
capture
a
return
horse
but
when
he
recognized
me
he
at
once
changed
his
tone
and
he
became
friendly
when
i
told
him
that
midget
had
invited
me
to
ride
he
said
that
as
she
had
invited
me
to
ride
i
should
have
to
pay
the
damages
to
her
i
told
him
that
we
had
already
agreed
to
this
but
how
in
thunder
did
you
catch
her
he
asked
yesterday
pat
tried
that
and
he
is
now
in
the
hospital
with
two
broken
ribs
she
kicked
him
i
said
to
midget
and
went
to
my
supper
leaving
her
contentedly
eating
salted
peanuts
faithful
scotch
i
carried
little
scotch
all
day
long
in
my
overcoat
pocket
as
i
rode
through
the
mountains
on
the
way
to
my
cabin
his
cheerful
cunning
face
his
good
behavior
and
the
clever
way
in
which
he
poked
his
head
out
of
my
pocket
licked
my
hand
and
looked
at
the
scenery
completely
won
my
heart
before
i
had
ridden
an
hour
that
night
he
showed
so
strikingly
the
strong
faithful
characteristics
for
which
collies
are
noted
that
i
resolved
never
to
part
with
him
since
then
we
have
had
great
years
together
we
have
been
hungry
and
happy
together
and
together
we
have
played
by
the
cabin
faced
danger
in
the
wilds
slept
peacefully
among
the
flowers
followed
the
trails
by
starlight
and
cuddled
down
in
winter
drifting
snow
on
my
way
home
through
the
mountains
with
puppy
scotch
i
stopped
for
a
night
near
a
deserted
and
shut
him
up
in
a
small
abandoned
cabin
he
at
once
objected
and
set
up
a
terrible
barking
and
howling
gnawing
fiercely
at
the
crack
beneath
the
door
and
trying
to
tear
his
way
out
fearing
he
would
break
his
little
puppy
teeth
or
possibly
die
from
frantic
and
persistent
efforts
to
be
free
i
concluded
to
release
him
from
the
cabin
my
fears
that
he
would
run
away
if
left
free
were
groundless
he
made
his
way
to
my
saddle
which
lay
on
the
ground
near
by
crawled
under
it
turned
round
beneath
it
and
thrust
his
little
head
from
beneath
the
arch
of
the
horn
and
lay
down
with
a
look
of
contentment
and
also
with
an
air
which
said
i
take
care
of
this
saddle
i
like
to
see
any
one
touch
it
illustration
scotch
near
timber
line
and
watch
it
he
did
at
midnight
a
cowboy
came
to
my
he
had
been
thrown
from
his
bronco
and
was
making
back
to
his
outfit
on
foot
in
approaching
the
fire
his
path
lay
close
to
my
saddle
beneath
which
scotch
was
lying
tiny
scotch
flew
at
him
ferociously
never
have
i
seen
such
faithful
ferociousness
in
a
dog
so
small
and
young
i
took
him
in
my
hands
and
assured
him
that
the
visitor
was
welcome
and
in
a
moment
little
scotch
and
the
cowboy
were
side
by
side
gazing
at
the
fire
i
suppose
his
bravery
and
watchful
spirit
may
be
instinct
inherited
from
his
famous
forbears
who
lived
so
long
and
so
cheerfully
on
scotland
heaths
and
moors
but
with
all
due
respect
for
inherited
qualities
he
also
has
a
brain
that
does
a
little
thinking
and
meets
emergencies
promptly
and
ably
he
took
serious
objection
to
the
coyotes
which
howled
serenaded
and
made
merry
in
the
edge
of
the
meadow
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
my
cabin
just
back
of
their
was
a
thick
forest
of
pines
in
which
were
scores
of
broken
rocky
crags
into
the
tangled
forest
the
coyotes
always
retreated
when
scotch
gave
chase
and
into
this
retreat
he
dared
not
pursue
them
so
long
as
the
coyotes
sunned
themselves
kept
quiet
and
played
scotch
simply
watched
them
contentedly
from
afar
but
the
instant
they
began
to
howl
and
yelp
he
at
once
raced
over
and
chased
them
into
the
woods
they
often
yelped
and
taunted
him
from
their
safe
retreat
but
scotch
always
took
pains
to
lie
down
on
the
edge
of
the
open
and
remain
there
until
they
became
quiet
or
went
away
during
the
second
winter
that
scotch
was
with
me
and
before
he
was
two
years
of
age
one
of
the
wily
coyotes
showed
a
tantalizing
spirit
and
some
interesting
cunning
which
put
scotch
on
his
mettle
one
day
when
scotch
was
busy
driving
the
main
pack
into
the
woods
one
that
trotted
lame
with
the
right
fore
leg
emerged
from
behind
a
rocky
crag
at
the
edge
of
the
open
and
less
than
fifty
yards
from
scotch
hurrying
to
a
willow
clump
about
fifty
yards
in
scotch
rear
he
set
up
a
broken
chorus
of
yelps
and
howls
seemingly
with
delight
and
to
the
great
annoyance
of
scotch
who
at
once
raced
back
and
chased
the
noisy
taunter
into
the
woods
the
very
next
time
that
scotch
was
chasing
the
pack
away
the
crippled
coyote
again
sneaked
from
behind
the
crag
took
refuge
behind
the
willow
clump
and
began
delivering
a
perfect
shower
of
broken
yelps
scotch
at
once
turned
back
and
gave
chase
immediately
the
entire
pack
wheeled
from
retreat
and
took
up
defiant
attitudes
in
the
open
but
this
did
not
seem
to
trouble
scotch
he
flung
himself
upon
them
with
great
ferocity
and
finally
drove
them
all
back
into
the
woods
however
the
third
time
that
the
cunning
coyote
had
come
to
his
rear
the
entire
pack
stopped
in
the
edge
of
the
open
and
for
a
time
defied
him
he
came
back
from
this
chase
panting
and
tired
and
carrying
every
expression
of
worry
it
seemed
to
prey
upon
him
to
such
an
extent
that
i
became
a
little
anxious
about
him
one
day
just
after
this
affair
i
went
for
the
mail
and
allowed
scotch
to
go
with
me
i
usually
left
him
at
the
cabin
and
he
stayed
unchained
and
was
faithful
though
it
was
always
evident
that
he
was
anxious
to
go
with
me
and
also
that
he
was
exceedingly
lonely
when
left
behind
but
on
this
occasion
he
showed
such
eagerness
to
go
that
i
allowed
him
the
pleasure
at
the
he
paid
but
little
attention
to
the
dogs
which
with
their
masters
were
assembled
there
and
held
himself
aloof
from
them
squatting
on
the
ground
with
head
erect
and
almost
an
air
of
contempt
for
them
but
it
was
evident
that
he
was
watching
their
every
move
when
i
started
homeward
he
showed
great
satisfaction
by
leaping
and
barking
that
night
was
wildly
stormy
and
i
concluded
to
go
out
and
enjoy
the
storm
on
some
crags
scotch
was
missing
and
i
called
him
but
he
did
not
appear
so
i
went
alone
after
being
tossed
by
the
wind
for
more
than
an
hour
i
returned
to
the
cabin
but
scotch
was
still
away
this
had
never
occurred
before
so
i
concluded
not
to
go
to
bed
until
he
returned
he
came
home
after
daylight
and
was
accompanied
by
another
dog
a
collie
which
belonged
to
a
rancher
who
lived
about
fifteen
miles
away
i
remembered
to
have
seen
this
dog
at
the
the
day
before
my
first
thought
was
to
send
the
dog
home
but
i
finally
concluded
to
allow
him
to
remain
to
see
what
would
come
of
his
presence
for
it
was
apparent
that
scotch
had
gone
for
him
he
appropriated
scotch
bed
in
the
tub
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
scotch
during
the
morning
the
two
played
together
in
the
happiest
possible
manner
for
more
than
an
hour
at
noon
i
fed
them
together
in
the
afternoon
while
i
was
writing
i
heard
the
varied
voices
of
the
coyote
pack
and
went
out
with
my
glass
to
watch
proceedings
wondering
how
the
visiting
collie
would
play
his
part
there
went
scotch
as
i
supposed
racing
for
the
yelping
pack
but
the
visiting
collie
was
not
to
be
seen
the
pack
beat
the
usual
sullen
scattering
retreat
and
while
the
dog
which
i
supposed
to
be
scotch
was
chasing
the
last
slow
tormenter
into
the
woods
from
behind
the
crag
came
the
big
limping
coyote
hurrying
toward
the
willow
clump
from
behind
which
he
was
accustomed
to
yelp
triumphantly
in
scotch
rear
i
raised
the
glass
for
a
better
look
all
the
time
wondering
where
the
visiting
collie
was
keeping
himself
i
was
unable
to
see
him
yet
i
recollected
he
was
with
scotch
less
than
an
hour
before
the
lame
coyote
came
round
the
willow
clump
as
usual
and
threw
up
his
head
as
though
to
bay
at
the
moon
then
the
unexpected
happened
on
the
instant
scotch
leaped
into
the
air
out
of
the
willow
clump
and
came
down
upon
the
coyote
back
they
rolled
about
for
some
time
when
the
coyote
finally
shook
himself
free
and
started
at
a
lively
limping
pace
for
the
woods
only
to
be
grabbed
again
by
the
visiting
collie
which
had
been
chasing
the
pack
and
which
i
had
mistaken
for
scotch
the
pack
beat
a
swift
retreat
for
a
time
both
dogs
fought
the
coyote
fiercely
but
he
at
last
tore
himself
free
and
escaped
into
the
pines
badly
wounded
and
bleeding
i
never
saw
him
again
that
night
the
visiting
collie
went
home
as
scotch
was
missing
that
night
for
a
time
i
think
he
may
have
accompanied
him
at
least
a
part
of
the
way
one
day
a
young
lady
from
michigan
came
along
and
wanted
to
climb
long
peak
all
alone
without
a
guide
i
agreed
to
consent
to
this
if
first
she
would
climb
one
of
the
lesser
peaks
unaided
on
a
stormy
day
this
the
young
lady
did
and
by
so
doing
convinced
me
that
she
had
a
keen
sense
of
direction
and
an
abundance
of
strength
for
the
day
on
which
she
climbed
was
a
stormy
one
and
the
peak
was
completely
befogged
with
clouds
after
this
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
allow
her
to
climb
long
peak
alone
just
as
she
was
starting
that
cool
september
morning
i
thought
to
provide
for
an
emergency
by
sending
scotch
with
her
he
knew
the
trail
well
and
would
of
course
lead
her
the
right
way
providing
she
lost
the
trail
scotch
said
i
go
with
this
young
lady
take
good
care
of
her
and
stay
with
her
till
she
returns
do
you
desert
her
he
gave
a
few
barks
of
satisfaction
and
started
with
her
up
the
trail
carrying
himself
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
he
was
both
honored
and
pleased
i
felt
that
the
strength
and
alertness
of
the
young
lady
when
combined
with
the
faithfulness
and
watchfulness
of
scotch
would
make
the
journey
a
success
so
i
went
about
my
affairs
as
usual
when
darkness
came
on
that
evening
the
young
lady
had
not
returned
she
climbed
swiftly
until
she
reached
the
rocky
alpine
moorlands
above
here
she
lingered
long
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
scenery
and
the
brilliant
flowers
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
she
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
peak
after
she
had
spent
a
little
time
there
resting
and
absorbing
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
the
scene
she
started
to
return
she
had
not
proceeded
far
when
clouds
and
darkness
came
on
and
on
a
slope
of
she
lost
the
trail
scotch
had
minded
his
own
affairs
and
enjoyed
himself
in
his
own
way
all
day
long
most
of
the
time
he
followed
her
closely
apparently
indifferent
to
what
happened
but
when
she
in
the
darkness
left
the
trail
and
started
off
in
the
wrong
direction
he
at
once
came
forward
and
took
the
lead
with
an
alert
aggressive
air
the
way
in
which
he
did
this
should
have
suggested
to
the
young
lady
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
but
she
did
not
appreciate
this
fact
she
thought
he
had
become
weary
and
wanted
to
run
away
from
her
so
she
called
him
back
again
she
started
in
the
wrong
direction
this
time
scotch
got
in
front
of
her
and
refused
to
move
she
pushed
him
out
of
the
way
once
more
he
started
off
in
the
right
direction
and
this
time
she
scolded
him
and
reminded
him
that
his
master
had
told
him
not
to
desert
her
scotch
dropped
his
ears
and
sheepishly
fell
in
behind
her
and
followed
meekly
along
he
had
obeyed
orders
after
traveling
a
short
distance
the
young
lady
realized
that
she
had
lost
her
way
but
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
only
to
trust
scotch
and
he
would
lead
her
directly
home
however
she
had
the
good
sense
to
stop
where
she
was
and
there
among
the
crags
by
the
stained
remnants
of
winter
snow
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
she
was
to
spend
the
night
the
cold
wind
blew
a
gale
roaring
and
booming
among
the
crags
the
alpine
brooklet
turned
to
ice
while
in
the
lee
of
the
crag
shivering
with
cold
hugging
shaggy
scotch
in
her
arms
she
lay
down
for
the
night
i
had
given
my
word
not
to
go
in
search
of
her
if
she
failed
to
return
however
i
sent
out
four
guides
to
look
for
her
they
suffered
much
from
cold
as
they
vainly
searched
among
the
crags
through
the
dark
hours
of
the
windy
night
just
at
sunrise
one
of
them
found
her
almost
exhausted
but
with
slightly
fingers
still
hugging
scotch
in
her
arms
he
gave
her
food
and
drink
and
additional
wraps
and
without
delay
started
with
her
down
the
trail
as
soon
as
she
was
taken
in
charge
by
the
guide
patient
scotch
left
her
and
hurried
home
he
had
saved
her
life
scotch
hair
is
long
and
silky
black
with
a
touch
of
tawny
about
the
head
and
a
little
bar
of
white
on
the
nose
he
has
the
most
expressive
and
pleasing
dog
face
i
have
ever
seen
there
is
nothing
he
enjoys
so
well
as
to
have
some
one
kick
the
football
for
him
for
an
hour
at
a
time
he
will
chase
it
and
try
to
get
hold
of
it
giving
an
occasional
eager
happy
bark
he
has
good
eyes
and
these
with
his
willingness
to
be
of
service
have
occasionally
made
him
useful
to
me
in
finding
articles
which
i
or
some
one
else
had
forgotten
or
lost
on
the
trail
generally
it
is
difficult
to
make
him
understand
just
what
has
been
lost
or
where
he
is
to
look
for
it
but
when
once
he
understands
he
keeps
up
the
search
sometimes
for
hours
if
he
does
not
find
the
article
before
he
is
always
faithful
in
guarding
any
object
that
i
ask
him
to
take
care
of
i
have
but
to
throw
down
a
coat
and
point
at
it
and
he
will
at
once
lie
down
near
by
there
to
remain
until
i
come
to
dismiss
him
he
will
allow
no
one
else
to
touch
it
his
attitude
never
fails
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
would
die
in
defense
of
the
thing
intrusted
to
him
but
desert
it
or
give
it
up
never
one
february
day
i
took
scotch
and
started
up
long
peak
hoping
to
gain
its
wintry
summit
scotch
easily
followed
in
my
at
an
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
on
the
steeps
there
was
but
little
snow
and
it
was
necessary
to
leave
snowshoes
behind
after
climbing
a
short
distance
on
these
icy
slopes
i
became
alarmed
for
the
safety
of
scotch
by
and
by
i
had
to
cut
steps
in
the
ice
this
made
the
climb
too
perilous
for
him
as
he
could
not
realize
the
danger
he
was
in
should
he
miss
a
step
there
were
places
where
slipping
from
these
steps
meant
death
so
i
told
scotch
to
go
back
i
did
not
however
tell
him
to
watch
my
snowshoes
for
so
dangerous
was
the
climb
that
i
did
not
know
that
i
should
ever
get
back
to
them
myself
however
he
went
to
the
snowshoes
and
with
them
he
remained
for
eight
cold
hours
until
i
came
back
by
the
light
of
the
stars
on
a
few
occasions
i
allowed
scotch
to
go
with
me
on
short
winter
excursions
he
enjoyed
these
immensely
although
he
had
a
hard
time
of
it
and
but
very
little
to
eat
when
we
camped
among
the
spruces
in
the
snow
he
seemed
to
enjoy
sitting
by
my
side
and
silently
watching
the
evening
fire
and
he
contentedly
cuddled
with
me
to
keep
warm
at
night
illustration
the
continental
divide
one
cold
day
we
were
returning
from
a
four
days
excursion
when
a
little
above
i
stopped
to
take
some
photographs
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
take
off
my
sheepskin
mittens
which
i
placed
in
my
but
not
securely
as
it
proved
from
time
to
time
as
i
climbed
to
the
summit
of
the
continental
divide
i
stopped
to
take
photographs
but
on
the
summit
the
cold
pierced
my
silk
gloves
and
i
felt
for
my
mittens
to
find
that
one
of
them
was
lost
i
stooped
put
an
arm
around
scotch
and
told
him
i
had
lost
a
mitten
and
that
i
wanted
him
to
go
down
for
it
to
save
me
the
trouble
it
wo
take
you
very
long
but
it
will
be
a
hard
trip
for
me
go
and
fetch
it
to
me
instead
of
starting
off
hurriedly
willingly
as
he
had
invariably
done
before
in
obedience
to
my
commands
he
stood
still
his
alert
eager
ears
drooped
but
no
other
move
did
he
make
i
repeated
the
command
in
my
most
kindly
tones
at
this
instead
of
starting
down
the
mountain
for
the
mitten
he
slunk
slowly
away
toward
home
it
was
clear
that
he
did
not
want
to
climb
down
the
steep
icy
slope
of
a
mile
to
more
than
a
thousand
feet
below
i
thought
he
had
misunderstood
me
so
i
called
him
back
patted
him
and
then
pointing
down
the
slope
said
go
for
the
mitten
scotch
i
will
wait
here
for
you
he
started
for
it
but
went
unwillingly
he
had
always
served
me
so
cheerfully
that
i
could
not
understand
and
it
was
not
until
late
the
next
afternoon
that
i
realized
that
he
had
not
understood
me
but
that
he
had
loyally
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
tried
to
obey
me
the
summit
of
the
continental
divide
where
i
stood
when
i
sent
him
back
was
a
very
rough
and
lonely
region
on
every
hand
were
broken
snowy
peaks
and
rugged
cañons
my
cabin
eighteen
miles
away
was
the
nearest
house
to
it
and
the
region
was
utterly
wild
i
waited
a
reasonable
time
for
scotch
to
return
but
he
did
not
come
back
thinking
he
might
have
gone
by
without
my
seeing
him
i
walked
some
distance
along
the
summit
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
the
other
but
seeing
neither
him
nor
his
tracks
i
knew
that
he
had
not
yet
come
back
as
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
growing
colder
i
decided
to
go
slowly
on
toward
my
cabin
i
started
along
a
route
that
i
felt
sure
he
would
follow
and
i
reasoned
that
he
would
overtake
me
darkness
came
on
and
still
no
scotch
but
i
kept
going
forward
for
the
remainder
of
the
way
i
told
myself
that
he
might
have
got
by
me
in
the
darkness
when
at
midnight
i
arrived
at
the
cabin
i
expected
to
be
greeted
by
him
but
he
was
not
there
i
felt
that
something
was
wrong
and
feared
that
he
had
met
with
an
accident
i
slept
two
hours
and
rose
but
still
he
was
missing
so
i
concluded
to
tie
on
my
snowshoes
and
go
to
meet
him
the
thermometer
showed
fourteen
below
zero
i
started
at
three
in
the
morning
feeling
that
i
should
meet
him
without
going
far
i
kept
going
on
and
on
and
when
at
noon
i
arrived
at
the
place
on
the
summit
from
which
i
had
sent
him
back
scotch
was
not
there
to
cheer
the
wintry
silent
scene
i
slowly
made
my
way
down
the
slope
and
at
two
in
the
afternoon
hours
after
i
had
sent
scotch
back
i
paused
on
a
crag
and
looked
below
there
in
the
snowy
world
of
white
he
lay
by
the
mitten
in
the
snow
he
had
misunderstood
me
and
had
gone
back
to
guard
the
mitten
instead
of
to
get
it
he
could
hardly
contain
himself
for
joy
when
he
saw
me
he
leaped
into
the
air
barked
jumped
rolled
over
licked
my
hand
whined
grabbed
the
mitten
raced
round
and
round
me
and
did
everything
that
an
alert
affectionate
faithful
dog
could
do
to
show
that
he
appreciated
my
appreciation
of
his
supremely
faithful
services
after
waiting
for
him
to
eat
a
luncheon
we
started
merrily
towards
home
where
we
arrived
at
one
in
the
morning
had
i
not
returned
i
suppose
scotch
would
have
died
beside
the
mitten
in
a
region
cold
cheerless
oppressive
without
food
and
perhaps
to
die
he
lay
down
by
the
mitten
because
he
understood
that
i
had
told
him
to
in
the
annals
of
dog
heroism
i
know
of
no
greater
deed
bob
and
some
other
birds
birds
are
plentiful
on
the
rockies
and
the
accumulating
information
concerning
them
may
in
a
few
years
accredit
colorado
with
having
more
kinds
of
birds
than
any
other
state
the
mountains
and
plains
of
colorado
carry
a
wide
range
of
geographic
conditions
a
variety
of
and
in
many
places
there
is
an
abundance
of
of
many
kinds
these
conditions
naturally
produce
a
large
variety
of
birds
throughout
the
state
notwithstanding
this
array
of
feathered
inhabitants
most
tourists
who
visit
the
west
complain
of
a
scarcity
of
birds
but
birds
the
rockies
have
and
any
could
tell
why
more
of
them
are
not
seen
by
tourists
the
loud
manners
of
most
tourists
who
invade
the
rockies
simply
put
the
birds
to
flight
when
i
hear
the
approach
of
tourists
in
the
wilds
i
feel
instinctively
that
i
should
fly
for
safety
myself
our
little
brothers
of
the
air
the
world
over
dislike
the
crowd
and
will
linger
only
for
those
who
come
with
deliberation
and
quiet
this
entire
from
foothills
to
is
enlivened
in
with
scores
of
species
of
birds
low
down
on
the
foothills
one
will
find
bullock
oriole
the
woodpecker
the
arkansas
kingbird
and
one
will
often
see
and
more
often
hear
the
clear
strong
notes
of
the
western
meadowlark
ringing
over
the
hills
and
meadows
the
wise
and
rather
murderous
magpie
goes
chattering
about
here
and
there
the
quiet
bluebird
is
seen
the
kingfisher
is
in
his
appointed
place
jays
crows
and
pigmy
nuthatches
are
plentiful
and
the
wild
note
of
the
chickadee
is
heard
on
every
hand
above
the
altitude
of
eight
thousand
feet
you
may
hear
in
june
the
marvelous
melody
of
audubon
hermit
thrush
along
the
brooks
and
streams
lives
the
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
of
rocky
mountain
birds
it
loves
the
swift
cool
it
feeds
in
them
nests
within
reach
of
the
splash
of
their
spray
closely
follows
their
bent
and
sinuous
course
in
flight
and
from
an
islanded
boulder
mingles
its
liquid
song
with
the
music
of
the
moving
waters
there
is
much
in
the
life
of
the
ouzel
that
is
refreshing
and
inspiring
i
wish
it
were
better
known
around
in
summer
one
may
hear
the
happy
song
of
the
sparrow
here
and
above
lives
the
leucosticte
far
above
the
vanguard
of
the
brave
pines
where
the
brilliant
flowers
fringe
the
soiled
remnants
of
winter
drifted
snow
where
sometimes
the
bees
hum
and
the
painted
butterflies
sail
on
easy
wings
the
hummingbird
may
occasionally
be
seen
while
still
higher
the
eagles
soar
in
the
quiet
bending
blue
on
the
heights
sometimes
nesting
at
an
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
is
found
the
ptarmigan
which
like
the
eskimo
seems
supremely
contented
in
the
land
of
crags
and
snows
of
all
the
birds
on
the
rockies
the
one
most
marvelously
eloquent
is
the
solitaire
i
have
often
felt
that
everything
stood
still
and
that
every
beast
and
bird
listened
while
the
matchless
solitaire
sang
the
hermit
thrush
seems
to
suppress
one
to
give
one
a
touch
of
reflective
loneliness
but
the
solitaire
stirs
one
to
be
up
and
doing
gives
one
the
spirit
of
youth
in
the
solitaire
song
one
feels
all
the
freshness
and
the
promise
of
spring
the
song
seems
to
be
born
of
ages
of
freedom
beneath
peaceful
skies
of
the
rhythm
of
the
universe
of
a
mingling
of
the
melody
of
winds
and
waters
and
of
all
rhythmic
sounds
that
murmur
and
echo
out
of
doors
and
of
every
song
that
nature
sings
in
the
wild
gardens
of
the
world
i
am
sure
i
have
never
been
more
thoroughly
wide
awake
and
hopeful
than
when
listening
to
the
solitaire
song
the
world
is
flushed
with
a
diviner
atmosphere
every
object
carries
a
fresher
significance
there
are
new
thoughts
and
clear
calm
hopes
sure
to
be
realized
on
the
enchanted
fields
of
the
future
i
was
camping
alone
one
evening
in
the
deep
solitude
of
the
rockies
the
slanting
were
glowing
on
hills
and
everything
was
at
peace
when
from
a
treetop
came
the
triumphant
hopeful
song
of
a
solitaire
and
i
forgot
all
except
that
the
world
was
young
one
believes
in
fairies
when
the
solitaire
sings
some
of
my
friends
have
predicted
that
i
shall
some
time
meet
with
an
accident
and
perish
in
the
solitudes
alone
if
their
prediction
should
come
true
i
shall
hope
it
will
be
in
the
while
the
flowers
are
at
their
best
and
that
during
my
last
conscious
moments
i
shall
hear
the
melody
of
the
solitaire
singing
as
i
die
with
the
dying
day
i
sat
for
hours
in
the
woods
one
day
watching
a
pair
of
chickadees
feeding
their
young
ones
there
were
nine
of
these
hungry
midgets
and
like
nine
small
boys
they
not
only
were
always
hungry
but
were
capable
of
digesting
everything
they
ate
spiders
and
flies
green
worms
ants
millers
dirty
brown
worms
by
the
dozen
woodlice
bits
of
lichen
grasshoppers
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
things
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
when
one
family
of
birds
destroyed
such
numbers
of
injurious
insects
if
all
the
birds
were
to
stop
eating
the
insects
would
soon
destroy
every
green
tree
and
plant
on
earth
one
of
the
places
where
i
used
to
camp
to
enjoy
the
flowers
the
trees
and
the
birds
was
on
the
shore
of
a
glacier
lake
near
the
lake
were
eternal
snows
rugged
gorges
and
forests
primeval
to
its
shore
especially
in
autumn
came
many
bird
callers
i
often
screened
myself
in
a
dense
clump
of
fir
trees
on
the
north
shore
to
study
the
manners
of
birds
which
came
near
to
help
attract
and
detain
them
i
scattered
feed
on
the
shore
and
i
spent
interesting
hours
and
days
in
my
enjoying
the
etiquette
of
birds
at
feast
and
frolic
i
was
lying
in
the
sun
one
afternoon
just
outside
my
fir
clump
gazing
out
across
the
lake
when
a
large
black
bird
alighted
on
the
shore
some
distance
around
the
lake
surely
i
said
to
myself
that
is
a
crow
a
crow
i
had
not
seen
or
heard
of
in
that
part
of
the
country
i
wanted
to
call
to
him
that
he
was
welcome
to
eat
at
my
counter
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
in
plain
sight
before
i
could
move
the
bird
rose
in
the
air
and
started
flying
leisurely
toward
me
i
hoped
he
would
see
or
smell
the
feed
and
tarry
for
a
time
but
he
rose
as
he
advanced
and
as
he
appeared
to
be
looking
ahead
i
had
begun
to
fear
he
would
go
by
without
stopping
when
he
suddenly
wheeled
and
at
the
same
instant
said
hurrah
as
distinctly
as
i
have
ever
heard
it
spoken
and
dropped
to
the
feed
the
clearness
energy
and
unexpectedness
of
his
hurrah
startled
me
he
alighted
and
began
to
eat
evidently
without
suspecting
my
presence
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
lay
only
a
few
feet
away
some
days
before
a
mountain
lion
had
killed
a
mountain
sheep
a
part
of
this
carcass
i
had
dragged
to
my
bird
table
upon
this
the
crow
for
such
he
was
alighted
and
fed
ravenously
for
some
time
then
he
paused
straightened
up
and
took
a
look
about
his
eye
fell
on
me
and
instantly
he
squatted
as
if
to
hurl
himself
in
hurried
flight
but
he
hesitated
then
appeared
as
if
starting
to
burst
out
with
caw
or
some
such
exclamation
but
changed
his
mind
and
repressed
it
finally
he
straightened
and
fixed
himself
for
another
good
look
at
me
i
did
not
move
and
my
clothes
must
have
been
a
good
shade
of
protective
coloring
for
he
seemed
to
conclude
that
i
was
not
worth
considering
he
looked
straight
at
me
for
a
few
seconds
uttered
another
hurrah
which
he
emphasized
with
a
defiant
gesture
and
went
on
energetically
eating
in
the
midst
of
this
something
alarmed
him
and
he
flew
swiftly
away
and
did
not
come
back
was
this
crow
a
pet
that
had
concluded
to
strike
out
for
himself
or
had
his
mimicry
or
his
habit
of
laying
hold
of
whatever
pleased
him
caused
him
to
appropriate
this
word
from
bigger
folk
go
where
you
will
over
the
rockies
and
the
birds
will
be
with
you
one
day
i
spent
several
hours
on
the
summit
of
long
peak
and
while
there
twelve
species
of
birds
alighted
or
passed
near
enough
for
me
to
identify
them
one
of
these
birds
was
an
eagle
another
a
hummingbird
illustration
ptarmigan
on
a
june
day
while
the
heights
were
more
than
half
covered
with
winter
snow
i
came
across
the
nest
of
a
ptarmigan
near
a
drift
and
at
an
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
ptarmigan
with
their
home
above
amid
eternal
snows
are
wonderfully
and
the
ouzel
too
is
indifferent
to
all
the
world
but
his
brook
and
showing
an
appreciation
for
water
greater
i
think
than
that
of
any
other
landsman
these
birds
the
ptarmigan
and
the
ouzel
along
with
the
willow
thrush
who
sings
out
his
melody
amid
the
shadows
of
the
pines
who
puts
his
woods
into
song
these
birds
of
the
mountains
are
with
me
when
memory
takes
me
back
a
solitary
visitor
to
the
lonely
places
of
the
rockies
the
birds
of
the
rockies
as
well
as
the
bigger
folk
who
live
there
have
ways
of
their
own
which
distinguish
them
from
their
kind
in
the
east
they
sing
with
more
enthusiasm
but
with
the
same
subtle
tone
that
everywhere
tells
that
all
is
right
with
the
world
and
makes
all
to
the
manner
born
glad
to
be
alive
nothing
delights
me
more
than
to
come
across
a
person
who
is
interested
in
trees
and
i
have
long
thought
that
any
one
who
appreciates
trees
or
birds
is
one
who
is
either
good
or
great
or
both
i
consider
it
an
honor
to
converse
with
one
who
knows
the
birds
and
the
trees
and
have
more
than
once
gone
out
of
my
way
to
meet
one
of
those
favored
mortals
i
remember
one
cold
morning
i
came
down
off
the
mountains
and
went
into
a
house
to
get
warm
rather
i
went
in
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
whomsoever
could
be
living
there
who
remembered
the
birds
while
snow
and
cold
prevailed
when
nature
forgot
to
get
warm
was
a
palpable
excuse
i
was
not
cold
i
had
no
need
to
stop
i
simply
wanted
to
meet
the
people
who
had
on
this
day
at
least
put
out
food
and
warm
water
for
the
birds
but
i
have
ever
since
been
glad
that
i
went
in
for
the
house
shielded
from
the
cold
a
family
whom
it
is
good
to
know
and
besides
making
their
acquaintance
i
met
bob
and
heard
her
story
every
one
in
the
house
was
fond
of
pets
rex
a
huge
bernard
greeted
me
at
the
door
and
with
a
show
of
satisfaction
accompanied
me
to
a
chair
near
the
stove
in
going
to
the
chair
some
forlorn
snowbirds
that
sarah
had
found
nearly
frozen
while
out
feeding
the
birds
this
morning
hopped
out
of
my
way
as
i
sat
down
i
noticed
an
old
sack
on
the
floor
against
the
wall
before
me
all
at
once
this
sack
came
to
life
had
an
idea
or
was
bewitched
i
thought
anyway
it
became
so
active
that
it
held
my
attention
for
several
seconds
and
gave
me
a
little
alarm
i
was
relieved
when
out
of
it
tumbled
an
aggressive
rooster
which
advanced
a
few
steps
flapped
and
crowed
lustily
he
was
brought
in
to
get
thawed
out
i
suppose
you
will
next
be
wondering
where
we
keep
the
pig
said
my
hostess
as
she
advanced
to
stir
the
fire
after
which
she
examined
two
little
cripples
birds
in
a
box
behind
the
stove
i
moved
to
a
cooler
seat
by
a
door
which
led
into
an
adjoining
room
after
i
had
sat
down
bob
a
pet
quail
came
from
somewhere
and
advanced
with
the
most
serene
and
dignified
air
to
greet
me
after
pausing
to
eye
me
for
a
moment
with
a
look
of
mingled
curiosity
and
satisfaction
she
went
under
my
chair
and
squatted
confidingly
on
the
floor
bob
was
the
first
pet
quail
i
had
ever
seen
and
my
questions
concerning
her
brought
from
my
hostess
the
following
story
one
day
last
fall
a
flock
of
quail
became
frightened
and
in
their
excited
flight
one
struck
against
a
neighbor
window
and
was
badly
stunned
my
husband
who
chanced
to
be
near
at
the
time
picked
up
the
injured
one
and
brought
it
home
my
three
daughters
who
at
times
had
had
pet
horses
snakes
turtles
and
rats
welcomed
this
shy
little
stranger
and
at
once
set
about
caring
for
her
injuries
just
before
bob
had
fully
recovered
there
came
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
which
was
followed
by
such
a
succession
of
storms
that
we
concluded
to
keep
her
with
us
provided
she
was
willing
to
stay
we
gave
her
the
freedom
of
the
house
for
some
time
she
was
wild
and
shy
under
a
chair
or
the
lounge
she
would
scurry
if
any
one
approached
her
plainly
she
did
not
feel
welcome
or
safe
in
our
house
and
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
taming
her
one
day
however
we
had
lettuce
for
dinner
and
while
we
were
at
the
table
sarah
my
eldest
daughter
who
has
a
gift
for
taming
and
handling
wild
creatures
declared
that
bob
should
eat
out
of
her
hand
before
night
all
that
afternoon
she
tempted
her
with
bits
of
lettuce
and
when
evening
came
had
succeeded
so
well
that
never
after
was
bob
afraid
of
us
whenever
we
sat
down
for
a
meal
bob
would
come
running
and
quietly
go
in
turn
to
each
with
coaxing
sounds
and
pleading
looks
wanting
to
be
fed
it
was
against
the
rules
to
feed
her
at
meals
but
first
one
then
another
would
slip
something
to
her
under
the
table
trying
at
the
same
time
to
appear
innocent
the
girls
have
always
maintained
that
their
mother
who
made
the
rule
was
the
first
one
to
break
it
no
one
could
resist
bob
pretty
dainty
coaxing
ways
she
is
particularly
fond
of
and
many
a
time
i
have
found
the
edge
picked
off
the
pie
i
had
intended
for
dinner
bob
never
fails
to
find
a
pie
if
one
is
left
uncovered
i
think
it
is
the
shortening
in
the
that
gives
it
the
delicious
flavor
for
lard
she
prefers
above
all
of
her
many
foods
she
cares
least
of
all
for
grain
my
daughters
say
that
bob
fondness
for
graham
gems
accounts
for
the
frequency
of
their
recent
appearances
on
our
table
after
trying
many
places
bob
at
last
found
a
that
suited
her
this
was
in
a
leather
on
the
bureau
where
she
could
nestle
up
close
to
her
own
image
in
the
mirror
since
discovering
this
place
she
has
never
failed
to
occupy
it
at
night
she
is
intelligent
and
in
so
many
ways
pleasing
that
we
are
greatly
attached
to
her
here
i
had
to
leave
bob
and
her
good
friends
behind
but
some
months
afterward
my
hostess
of
that
winter
day
told
me
the
concluding
chapters
of
bob
life
bob
disliked
to
be
handled
though
pleasing
and
irresistibly
winsome
she
was
not
in
the
least
affectionate
and
always
maintained
a
dignified
ladylike
reserve
but
with
the
appearance
of
spring
she
showed
signs
of
lonesomeness
with
none
of
her
kind
to
love
she
turned
to
rex
and
on
him
lavished
all
of
her
affection
when
rex
was
admitted
to
the
house
of
a
morning
she
ran
to
meet
him
with
a
joyful
cackle
an
utterance
she
did
not
use
on
any
other
occasion
and
with
soft
cooing
sounds
she
followed
him
about
the
house
if
rex
appeared
bored
with
her
attentions
and
walked
away
she
followed
after
and
persisted
in
tones
that
were
surely
scolding
until
he
would
lie
down
whenever
he
lay
with
his
huge
head
between
his
paws
she
would
nestle
down
close
to
his
face
and
remain
content
so
long
as
he
was
quiet
sometimes
when
he
was
lying
down
she
would
climb
slowly
over
him
at
each
step
she
would
put
her
foot
down
daintily
and
as
each
foot
touched
him
there
was
a
slight
movement
of
her
head
and
a
look
of
satisfaction
these
climbs
usually
ended
by
her
scratching
in
the
long
hair
of
his
tail
and
then
nestling
down
into
it
one
day
i
was
surprised
to
see
her
kiss
rex
when
i
told
my
family
of
this
they
laughed
heartily
and
were
unable
to
believe
me
later
we
all
witnessed
this
pretty
sight
many
times
she
seemed
to
prefer
to
kiss
him
when
he
was
lying
down
with
his
head
raised
a
little
above
the
floor
finding
him
in
this
position
she
would
walk
beside
him
reach
up
and
kiss
his
face
again
and
again
all
the
time
cooing
softly
to
him
toward
spring
bob
feathers
became
dull
and
somewhat
ragged
and
with
the
warm
days
came
our
decision
to
let
her
go
outside
she
was
delighted
to
scratch
in
the
loose
earth
around
the
rosebushes
and
eagerly
fed
on
the
insects
she
found
there
her
plumage
soon
took
on
its
natural
trimness
and
freshness
she
did
not
show
any
inclination
to
leave
and
with
rex
by
her
or
near
her
we
felt
that
she
was
safe
from
cats
so
we
soon
allowed
her
to
remain
out
all
day
long
often
stopped
to
watch
bob
and
rex
playing
together
sometimes
he
would
go
lumbering
across
the
yard
while
she
plainly
displeased
at
the
fast
pace
hurried
after
with
an
incessant
scolding
chatter
as
much
as
to
say
go
so
fast
old
fellow
how
do
you
expect
me
to
keep
up
sometimes
when
rex
was
lying
down
eating
a
bone
she
would
stand
on
one
of
his
fore
legs
and
quietly
pick
away
at
the
bone
the
girls
frequently
went
out
to
call
her
and
did
so
by
whistling
white
she
never
failed
to
answer
promptly
and
her
response
sounded
like
chos
chee
which
she
uttered
before
hurrying
to
them
one
summer
morning
i
found
her
at
the
kitchen
door
waiting
to
be
let
out
i
opened
the
door
and
watched
her
go
tripping
down
the
steps
when
she
started
across
the
yard
i
cautioned
her
to
a
little
lady
and
do
get
too
far
away
rex
was
away
that
morning
and
soon
one
of
the
girls
went
out
to
call
her
repeated
calls
brought
no
answer
we
all
started
searching
we
wondered
if
the
cat
had
caught
her
or
if
she
had
been
lured
away
by
the
winning
calls
of
her
kind
beneath
a
cherry
tree
near
the
kitchen
door
just
as
rex
came
home
we
found
her
bloody
and
dead
rex
after
pushing
her
body
tenderly
about
with
his
nose
as
if
trying
to
help
her
to
rise
looked
up
and
appealed
piteously
to
us
we
buried
her
beneath
the
rosebush
near
which
she
and
rex
had
played
kinnikinick
the
kinnikinick
is
a
plant
pioneer
often
it
is
the
first
plant
to
make
a
settlement
or
establish
a
colony
on
a
barren
or
area
it
is
hardy
and
is
able
to
make
a
start
and
thrive
in
places
so
inhospitable
as
to
afford
most
plants
not
the
slightest
foothold
in
such
places
the
kinnikinick
activities
make
changes
which
alter
conditions
so
beneficially
that
in
a
little
while
plants
less
hardy
come
to
join
the
first
settler
the
pioneer
work
done
by
the
kinnikinick
on
a
barren
and
rocky
realm
has
often
resulted
in
the
establishment
of
a
flourishing
forest
there
the
kinnikinick
or
as
the
botanists
name
it
may
be
called
a
vine
though
always
attractive
it
is
in
winter
that
it
is
at
its
best
then
its
bright
green
leaves
and
red
berries
shine
among
the
in
a
quiet
way
that
is
strikingly
beautiful
since
it
is
beautiful
as
well
as
useful
i
had
long
admired
this
vine
before
i
appreciated
the
good
though
humble
work
it
is
constantly
doing
i
had
often
stopped
to
greet
it
the
only
green
thing
upon
a
rock
ledge
or
a
sandy
stretch
had
walked
over
it
in
forest
avenues
beneath
tall
and
stately
pines
and
had
slept
comfortably
upon
its
spicy
elastic
rugs
liking
it
from
the
first
but
on
one
of
my
winter
tramps
i
fell
in
love
with
this
beautiful
evergreen
the
day
was
a
cold
one
and
the
high
gusty
wind
was
tossing
and
playing
with
the
last
i
had
been
snowshoeing
through
the
forest
and
had
come
out
upon
an
unsheltered
ridge
that
was
a
part
of
a
barren
area
which
repeated
fires
had
changed
from
a
forested
condition
to
desert
the
snow
lay
several
feet
deep
in
the
woods
but
as
the
gravelly
distance
before
me
was
bare
i
took
off
my
snowshoes
i
went
walking
and
at
times
blowing
along
the
bleak
ridge
scarcely
able
to
see
through
the
air
but
during
a
lull
the
air
cleared
of
and
i
paused
to
look
about
me
the
wind
still
roared
in
the
distance
and
against
the
blue
eastern
sky
it
had
a
column
of
snow
whirling
that
was
dazzling
white
in
the
afternoon
sun
on
my
left
a
mountain
rose
with
easy
slope
to
heights
and
for
miles
swept
away
before
me
with
seared
side
barren
and
dull
a
few
cloudlets
of
snowdrifts
and
a
scattering
of
mere
tufts
of
snow
stood
out
distinctly
on
this
big
bare
slope
i
wondered
what
could
be
holding
these
few
spots
of
snow
on
this
slope
i
finally
went
up
to
examine
one
of
them
thrust
out
and
lifted
just
above
the
snow
of
the
tuft
before
me
was
the
jeweled
hand
of
a
kinnikinick
and
every
on
the
slope
was
held
in
place
by
the
green
arms
of
this
plant
here
was
this
beautiful
vinelike
shrub
gladly
growing
on
a
slope
that
had
been
forsaken
by
all
other
plants
to
state
the
situation
fairly
all
had
been
burned
off
by
fire
and
kinnikinick
was
the
first
to
come
back
and
so
completely
had
fires
consumed
the
that
many
plants
would
be
unable
to
live
here
until
better
conditions
prevailed
and
the
struggle
for
existence
was
made
less
severe
kinnikinick
was
making
the
needed
changes
in
time
it
would
prepare
the
way
and
other
plants
and
the
pines
too
would
come
back
to
carpet
and
plume
the
slope
and
prevent
wind
and
water
from
tearing
and
scarring
the
earth
the
seeds
of
kinnikinick
are
scattered
by
birds
chipmunks
wind
and
water
i
do
not
know
by
what
agency
the
seeds
had
come
to
this
slope
but
here
were
the
plants
and
on
this
dry
slope
they
must
have
endured
many
hardships
many
must
have
perished
before
these
living
ones
had
made
a
secure
start
in
life
once
kinnikinick
has
made
a
start
it
is
constantly
assisted
to
succeed
by
its
own
growing
success
its
arms
catch
and
hold
snow
and
this
gives
a
supply
of
water
this
water
is
snugly
stored
beneath
the
plant
where
but
little
can
be
reached
or
taken
by
the
sun
or
the
thirsty
winds
the
winds
too
which
were
so
unfriendly
while
it
was
trying
to
make
a
start
now
become
helpful
to
the
brave
persistent
plant
every
wind
that
blows
brings
something
to
it
dust
powdered
earth
trash
the
remains
of
dead
insects
some
of
this
material
is
carried
for
miles
all
goes
to
form
new
soil
or
to
fertilize
or
mulch
the
old
this
supplies
kinnikinick
great
needs
the
plant
grows
rich
from
the
constant
tribute
of
the
winds
the
grows
deeper
and
richer
and
is
also
constantly
outbuilding
and
enlarging
and
kinnikinick
steadily
increases
its
size
in
a
few
years
a
small
oasis
is
formed
in
or
rather
on
the
barren
this
becomes
a
place
of
refuge
for
seed
wanderers
in
fact
a
nursery
up
the
slope
i
saw
a
young
pine
standing
in
a
kinnikinick
in
the
edge
of
the
by
me
covered
with
a
robe
of
snow
i
found
a
tiny
tree
a
mere
baby
pine
where
did
this
pine
come
from
there
were
no
pines
within
miles
how
did
a
pine
seed
find
its
way
to
this
cosy
nursery
perhaps
the
following
is
its
story
the
seed
of
this
little
pine
together
with
a
score
or
more
of
others
grew
in
a
cone
out
near
the
end
of
the
limb
this
pine
was
on
a
mountain
several
miles
from
the
slope
when
one
windy
autumn
day
some
time
after
the
seeds
were
ripe
the
cone
began
to
open
its
fingers
and
the
seeds
came
dropping
out
the
seed
of
this
baby
tree
was
one
of
these
and
when
it
tumbled
out
of
the
cone
the
wind
caught
it
and
away
it
went
over
trees
rocks
and
gulches
whirling
and
dancing
in
the
autumn
sunlight
after
tumbling
a
few
miles
in
this
wild
flight
it
came
down
among
some
boulders
here
it
lay
until
one
very
windy
day
it
was
caught
up
and
whirled
away
again
before
long
it
was
dashed
against
a
granite
cliff
and
fell
to
the
ground
but
in
a
moment
the
wind
found
it
and
drove
it
with
a
shower
of
trash
and
dust
bounding
and
leaping
across
a
barren
slope
plump
into
this
kinnikinick
nest
from
this
shelter
the
wind
could
not
drive
it
here
the
little
seed
might
have
said
this
is
just
the
place
i
was
looking
for
here
is
shelter
from
the
wind
and
sun
the
soil
is
rich
and
damp
i
am
so
tired
i
think
i
take
a
sleep
when
the
little
seed
awoke
it
wore
the
green
dress
of
the
pine
family
the
kinnikinick
nursery
had
given
it
a
start
in
life
under
favorable
conditions
kinnikinick
is
a
comparatively
rapid
grower
its
numerous
vinelike
limbs
little
arms
spread
or
reach
outward
from
the
central
root
take
a
new
hold
upon
the
earth
and
prepare
to
reach
again
the
ground
beneath
it
in
a
little
while
is
completely
hidden
by
its
closely
crowding
leafy
arms
in
places
these
soft
pliable
rugs
unite
and
form
extensive
carpets
strip
off
these
carpets
and
often
all
that
remains
is
a
barren
exposure
of
sand
or
gravel
on
bald
or
broken
rocks
whose
surfaces
and
edges
have
been
draped
or
buried
by
its
green
leaves
and
red
berries
in
may
kinnikinick
rugs
become
each
flower
is
a
jug
and
is
filled
with
a
drop
of
exquisitely
flavored
honey
the
jugs
in
a
short
time
change
to
smooth
purple
berries
and
in
autumn
they
take
on
their
winter
dress
of
scarlet
when
ripe
the
berries
taste
like
mealy
i
have
often
seen
chipmunks
eating
the
berries
or
apples
sitting
up
with
the
fruit
in
both
their
deft
little
hands
and
eating
it
with
such
evident
relish
that
i
frequently
found
myself
thinking
of
these
berries
as
chipmunk
apples
kinnikinick
is
widely
distributed
over
the
earth
and
is
most
often
found
on
gravelly
slopes
or
sandy
stretches
frequently
you
will
find
it
among
scattered
pines
trying
to
carpet
their
cathedral
floor
many
a
summer
day
i
have
lain
down
and
rested
on
these
flat
and
fluffy
forest
rugs
while
between
the
tangled
tops
of
the
pines
i
looked
at
the
blue
of
the
sky
or
watched
the
white
clouds
so
serenely
floating
there
many
a
summer
night
upon
these
elastic
spreads
i
have
lain
and
gazed
at
the
stars
or
watched
the
ebbing
fading
at
last
to
fall
asleep
and
to
rest
as
sweetly
and
serenely
as
ever
did
the
scotchman
upon
his
heathered
highlands
many
a
morning
i
have
awakened
late
after
a
sleep
so
long
that
i
had
settled
into
the
yielding
mass
and
kinnikinick
had
put
up
an
arm
either
to
shield
my
face
with
its
hand
or
to
show
me
when
i
should
awaken
its
pretty
red
berries
and
bright
green
leaves
illustration
summer
at
an
altitude
of
feet
one
morning
while
visiting
in
a
blackfoot
indian
camp
i
saw
the
men
smoking
kinnikinick
leaves
and
i
asked
if
they
had
any
legend
concerning
the
shrub
i
felt
sure
they
must
have
a
fascinating
story
of
it
which
told
of
the
great
spirit
love
for
kinnikinick
but
they
had
none
one
of
them
said
he
had
heard
the
piute
indians
tell
why
the
great
spirit
had
made
it
but
he
could
not
remember
the
account
i
inquired
among
many
indians
feeling
that
i
should
at
last
learn
a
happy
legend
concerning
it
but
in
vain
one
night
however
by
my
i
dreamed
that
some
alaska
indians
told
me
this
legend
long
long
ago
kinnikinick
was
a
small
tree
with
brown
berries
and
broad
leaves
which
dropped
to
the
ground
in
autumn
one
year
a
great
snow
came
while
the
leaves
were
still
on
and
all
trees
were
flattened
upon
the
ground
by
the
weight
of
the
clinging
snow
all
trees
except
kinnikinick
died
when
the
snow
melted
kinnikinick
was
still
alive
but
pressed
out
upon
the
ground
crushed
so
that
it
could
not
rise
it
started
to
grow
however
and
spread
out
its
limbs
on
the
surface
very
like
a
root
growth
the
great
spirit
was
so
pleased
with
kinnikinick
efforts
that
he
decided
to
let
it
live
on
in
its
new
form
and
also
that
he
would
send
it
to
colonize
many
places
where
it
had
never
been
he
changed
its
berries
from
brown
to
red
so
that
the
birds
could
see
its
fruit
and
scatter
its
seeds
far
and
wide
its
leaves
were
reduced
in
size
and
made
permanently
green
so
that
kinnikinick
like
the
pines
it
loves
and
helps
could
wear
green
all
the
time
whenever
i
see
a
place
that
has
been
made
barren
and
ugly
by
the
thoughtlessness
of
man
i
like
to
think
of
kinnikinick
for
i
know
it
will
beautify
these
places
if
given
a
chance
to
do
so
there
are
on
earth
millions
of
acres
now
almost
desert
that
may
some
time
be
changed
and
beautified
by
this
cheerful
modest
plant
some
time
many
bald
and
barren
places
in
the
rockies
will
be
plumed
with
pines
bannered
with
flowers
have
brooks
butterflies
and
singing
birds
all
of
these
and
homes
too
around
which
children
will
play
because
of
the
reclaiming
work
which
will
be
done
by
charming
kinnikinick
the
pine
the
trappers
gave
the
pine
var
its
popular
name
on
account
of
its
general
use
by
indians
of
the
west
for
lodge
or
wigwam
poles
it
is
a
tree
with
an
unusually
interesting
and
is
worth
knowing
for
the
triumphant
struggle
which
it
makes
for
existence
and
also
for
the
commercial
importance
which
at
an
early
date
it
seems
destined
to
have
perhaps
its
most
interesting
and
advantageous
characteristic
is
its
habit
of
holding
or
hoarding
its
is
also
variously
called
tamarack
murray
and
pine
its
needles
are
in
twos
and
are
from
one
to
three
inches
in
length
its
cones
are
about
one
inch
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
from
one
to
two
inches
long
its
or
bark
is
thin
and
scaly
in
a
typical
forest
the
trees
or
poles
stand
closely
together
and
all
are
of
the
same
age
and
of
even
size
seedlings
and
saplings
are
not
seen
in
an
old
forest
this
forest
covers
the
mountains
for
miles
growing
in
moist
dry
and
stony
places
claims

illustration
a
typical
forest
the
hoarding
habit
of
this
tree
the
service
rendered
it
by
forest
fires
the
lightness
of
the
seeds
and
the
readiness
with
which
they
germinate
on
dry
or
areas
its
ability
to
grow
in
a
variety
of
soils
and
climates
together
with
its
capacity
to
thrive
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
all
these
are
factors
which
make
this
tree
interesting
and
which
enable
it
despite
the
most
dangerous
forest
enemy
fire
to
increase
and
multiply
and
extend
its
domains
during
the
last
fifty
years
this
aggressive
indomitable
tree
has
enormously
extended
its
area
and
john
muir
is
of
the
opinion
that
as
fires
are
multiplied
and
the
mountains
become
drier
this
wonderful
pine
bids
fair
to
obtain
possession
of
nearly
all
the
forest
ground
in
the
west
its
geographical
range
is
along
the
rocky
mountains
from
alaska
to
new
mexico
and
on
the
pacific
coast
forests
of
it
are
in
places
found
from
to
an
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
on
the
rockies
it
flourishes
between
the
altitudes
of
seven
thousand
and
ten
thousand
feet
it
is
largely
represented
in
the
forests
of
colorado
utah
idaho
and
montana
and
it
has
extensive
areas
in
oregon
and
washington
it
is
the
most
numerous
tree
in
wyoming
occupying
in
yellowstone
park
a
larger
area
than
all
other
trees
combined
while
in
california
it
forms
the
bulk
of
the
alpine
forests
the
readily
adapts
itself
to
the
most
diverse
soil
and
conditions
but
it
thrives
best
where
there
is
considerable
moisture
the
roots
accommodate
themselves
to
shallow
soil
and
thrive
in
it
this
tree
begins
to
bear
fruit
at
an
early
age
sometimes
when
only
eight
years
old
and
usually
produces
large
quantities
of
cones
annually
the
cones
sometimes
open
and
liberate
the
seeds
as
soon
as
they
are
ripe
but
commonly
they
remain
on
the
tree
for
years
with
their
seeds
carefully
sealed
and
protected
beneath
the
scales
so
far
as
i
have
observed
the
trees
on
the
driest
soil
cling
longest
to
their
seeds
for
an
old
to
have
on
its
limbs
twenty
crops
of
unopened
cones
is
not
uncommon
neither
is
it
uncommon
to
see
an
extensive
forest
each
tree
of
which
has
upon
it
several
hundred
and
many
of
the
trees
a
few
thousand
cones
and
in
each
cone
a
few
mature
seeds
most
of
these
seeds
will
never
have
a
chance
to
make
a
start
in
life
except
they
be
liberated
by
fire
in
fact
most
seeds
are
liberated
by
fire
the
reproduction
of
this
pine
is
so
interwoven
with
the
effects
of
the
forest
fires
that
one
may
safely
say
that
most
of
the
forests
and
the
increasing
areas
are
the
result
of
forest
fires
every
forest
is
a
the
thin
scaly
pitchy
bark
and
the
live
resiny
needles
on
the
tree
as
well
as
those
on
the
ground
are
very
inflammable
and
fires
probably
sweep
a
forest
more
frequently
than
any
other
in
america
when
this
forest
is
in
a
sapling
stage
it
is
very
likely
to
be
burned
to
ashes
if
however
the
trees
are
beyond
the
sapling
stage
the
fire
probably
will
consume
the
needles
burn
some
of
the
bark
away
and
leave
the
tree
together
with
its
numerous
cones
unconsumed
as
a
rule
the
fire
so
heats
the
cones
that
most
of
them
open
and
release
their
seeds
a
few
hours
or
a
few
days
after
the
fire
if
the
area
burned
over
is
a
large
one
the
fire
loosens
the
clasp
of
the
and
millions
of
seeds
are
released
to
be
sown
by
the
great
eternal
the
wind
these
seeds
are
thickly
scattered
and
as
they
germinate
readily
in
the
mineral
soil
enormous
numbers
of
them
sprout
and
begin
to
struggle
for
existence
i
once
counted
young
trees
on
an
acre
the
trees
often
stand
as
thick
as
wheat
in
a
field
and
exclude
all
other
species
their
growth
is
slow
and
mostly
upright
they
early
become
delicate
miniature
poles
and
often
at
the
age
of
or
thirty
years
good
in
their
crowded
condition
the
competition
is
deadly
hundreds
annually
perish
but
this
tree
clings
tenaciously
to
life
and
starving
it
to
death
is
not
easy
in
the
summer
of
i
counted
upon
an
acre
ten
years
later
of
these
were
alive
it
is
possible
that
eighty
thousand
or
even
one
hundred
thousand
seedlings
started
upon
this
acre
sometimes
more
than
half
a
century
is
required
for
the
making
of
good
poles
on
the
grand
river
in
colorado
i
once
measured
a
number
of
poles
that
averaged
two
inches
in
diameter
at
the
ground
and
one
and
one
half
inches
fifteen
feet
above
it
these
poles
averaged
forty
feet
high
and
were
years
of
age
others
of
my
notes
read
trees
upon
an
acre
they
were
one
hundred
and
three
years
of
age
two
to
six
inches
in
diameter
four
and
a
half
feet
from
the
ground
and
from
thirty
to
sixty
feet
high
at
an
altitude
of
feet
soil
and
moisture
conditions
were
excellent
on
another
acre
there
were
trees
one
hundred
and
years
old
together
with
eleven
young
engelmann
spruces
and
one
and
eight
douglas
firs
the
accumulation
of
duff
mostly
needles
averaged
eight
inches
deep
and
with
the
exception
of
one
bunch
of
kinnikinick
there
was
neither
grass
nor
weed
and
only
tiny
thinly
scattered
reached
the
brown
matted
floor
after
has
gone
on
for
a
hundred
years
or
so
the
ranks
have
been
so
thinned
that
there
are
openings
sufficiently
large
to
allow
other
species
a
chance
to
come
in
by
this
time
too
there
is
sufficient
humus
on
the
floor
to
allow
the
seeds
of
many
other
species
to
germinate
thus
colonizes
barren
places
holds
them
for
a
time
and
so
changes
them
that
the
very
species
dispossessed
by
fire
may
regain
the
lost
territory
roughly
the
will
hold
the
ground
exclusively
from
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
then
the
invading
trees
will
come
triumphantly
in
and
during
the
next
century
and
a
half
will
so
increase
and
multiply
that
they
will
almost
exclude
the
thus
engelmann
spruce
and
douglas
fir
are
now
growing
where
flourished
but
let
fire
destroy
this
forest
and
will
again
claim
the
territory
hold
it
against
all
comers
for
a
century
or
two
and
then
slowly
give
way
to
or
be
displaced
by
the
spruces
and
firs
the
interesting
characteristic
of
holding
its
cones
and
hoarding
seeds
often
results
in
the
cones
being
overgrown
and
embedded
in
the
trunk
or
the
limbs
of
the
trees
as
the
cones
hug
closely
the
trunk
or
the
limbs
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
saw
when
laying
open
a
log
at
the
mill
to
reveal
a
number
of
cones
embedded
there
i
have
in
my
cabin
a
plank
that
is
two
inches
in
diameter
and
six
inches
wide
which
came
out
of
a
tree
embedded
in
this
are
more
than
a
score
of
cones
probably
most
of
these
cones
were
of
the
first
crop
which
the
tree
produced
for
they
clung
along
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
grew
there
when
it
was
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
in
diameter
the
section
upon
which
these
cones
grew
was
between
fifteen
and
feet
from
the
ground
the
seeds
of
most
conifers
need
vegetable
mould
litter
or
vegetation
cover
of
some
kind
in
which
to
germinate
and
then
shade
for
a
time
in
which
to
grow
these
requirements
so
needed
by
other
conifer
seeds
and
seedlings
are
detrimental
to
the
if
its
seeds
fall
on
areas
lightly
covered
with
low
huckleberry
vines
but
few
of
them
will
germinate
a
seed
that
germinates
in
the
shade
is
doomed
it
must
have
sunlight
or
die
in
the
ashes
of
a
forest
fire
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
the
seeds
of
the
germinate
grow
and
flourish
wind
is
the
chief
agency
which
enables
the
seeds
to
migrate
the
seeds
are
light
and
i
know
of
one
instance
where
an
isolated
tree
on
a
plateau
managed
to
scatter
its
seeds
by
the
aid
of
the
wind
over
a
circular
area
fifty
acres
in
extent
though
a
few
acres
is
all
that
is
reached
by
the
average
tree
sometimes
the
wind
scatters
the
seeds
unevenly
if
most
of
the
seeds
are
released
in
one
day
and
the
wind
this
day
prevails
from
the
same
quarter
the
seeds
will
take
but
one
course
from
the
tree
while
changing
winds
may
scatter
them
quite
evenly
all
around
the
tree
a
camping
party
built
a
fire
against
a
lone
the
tree
was
killed
and
suffered
a
loss
of
its
needles
from
the
fire
four
years
later
a
long
green
pennant
tattered
at
the
end
and
formed
of
seedlings
showed
on
the
this
pennant
began
at
the
tree
and
streamed
out
more
than
seven
hundred
feet
its
width
varied
from
ten
to
fifty
feet
the
action
of
a
fire
in
a
forest
is
varied
if
the
forest
be
an
old
one
even
with
much
rubbish
on
the
ground
the
heat
is
not
so
intense
as
in
a
young
growth
where
trees
are
scattered
the
flames
crawl
from
tree
to
tree
the
needles
of
which
ignite
like
and
make
beautiful
flames
at
night
fires
of
this
kind
furnish
rare
fireworks
each
tree
makes
a
fountain
of
flame
after
which
for
a
moment
every
needle
shines
like
incandescent
silver
while
exquisite
light
columns
of
ashen
green
smoke
float
above
the
hottest
fire
i
ever
experienced
was
made
by
the
burning
of
a
forest
in
this
forest
the
poles
stood
more
than
thirty
feet
high
and
were
about
fifteen
thousand
to
an
acre
they
stood
among
masses
of
fallen
trees
the
remains
of
a
spruce
forest
that
had
been
killed
by
the
same
fire
which
had
given
this
forest
a
chance
to
spring
up
several
thousand
acres
were
burned
and
for
a
brief
time
the
fire
traveled
swiftly
i
saw
it
roll
blazing
over
one
at
a
speed
of
more
than
sixty
miles
an
hour
it
was
intensely
hot
and
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
the
flames
had
burned
every
log
stump
and
tree
to
ashes
several
hundred
acres
were
swept
absolutely
bare
of
trees
living
and
dead
and
the
roots
too
were
burned
far
into
the
ground
several
beetles
prey
upon
the
and
in
some
localities
the
porcupine
feeds
off
its
inner
bark
it
is
also
made
use
of
by
man
the
wood
is
light
not
strong
with
a
straight
rather
coarse
grain
it
is
of
a
light
yellow
to
nearly
white
or
pinkish
white
soft
and
easily
worked
in
the
west
it
is
extensively
used
for
lumber
fencing
fuel
and
log
houses
and
millions
of
are
annually
put
to
use
most
grow
in
crowded
ranks
and
slow
growth
is
the
result
but
it
is
naturally
a
comparatively
rapid
grower
in
good
moist
soil
uncrowded
it
rapidly
builds
upward
and
outward
i
have
more
than
a
score
of
records
that
show
that
it
has
made
a
quarter
of
an
inch
diameter
growth
annually
together
with
an
upright
growth
of
more
than
twelve
inches
and
also
several
notes
which
show
where
trees
standing
in
favorable
conditions
have
made
half
an
inch
diameter
growth
annually
this
fact
of
its
rapid
growth
together
with
other
valuable
characteristics
and
qualities
of
the
tree
may
lead
it
to
be
selected
by
the
government
for
the
reforestation
of
millions
of
acres
of
denuded
areas
in
the
west
in
many
places
on
the
rockies
it
would
if
given
a
chance
make
commercial
timber
in
from
thirty
to
sixty
years
i
examined
a
in
the
medicine
bow
mountains
that
was
scarred
by
fire
it
was
two
hundred
and
fourteen
years
of
age
it
took
one
hundred
and
years
for
it
to
make
five
inches
of
diameter
growth
in
the
one
hundred
and
ring
of
annual
growth
there
was
a
and
during
the
next
years
it
put
on
five
more
inches
of
growth
it
is
probable
therefore
that
the
fire
destroyed
the
neighboring
trees
which
had
dwarfed
and
starved
it
and
thus
held
it
in
check
i
know
of
scores
of
cases
where
grew
much
more
rapidly
though
badly
after
fires
had
removed
their
hampering
competitors
there
are
millions
of
acres
of
young
forests
in
the
west
they
are
almost
as
impenetrable
as
canebrakes
it
would
greatly
increase
the
rate
of
growth
if
these
trees
were
thinned
but
it
is
probable
that
this
will
not
be
done
for
many
years
meantime
if
these
forests
be
protected
from
fire
they
will
be
excellent
when
the
snows
or
the
rains
fall
into
the
thickets
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
extra
dry
winds
if
they
are
protected
the
of
the
west
will
be
protected
and
if
they
are
destroyed
the
winds
will
evaporate
most
of
the
precipitation
that
falls
upon
their
areas
i
do
not
know
of
any
tree
that
better
adjusts
itself
to
circumstances
or
that
struggles
more
bravely
or
successfully
i
am
hopeful
that
before
many
years
the
of
america
will
be
well
acquainted
with
the
pine
and
i
feel
that
its
interesting
ways
its
struggles
and
its
importance
will
before
long
be
appreciated
and
win
a
larger
place
in
our
literature
and
also
in
our
hearts
rocky

it
is

to
stand
at
the

at
a
distance
of

thirty

is
an
inspiring
one
from
the

but
it
gives
no
idea
that
this

their

and
lives
long
i
have
seen
many
of
the
pines
that
were
from
sixty
to
ninety
feet
high
with
a
diameter
of
from
three
to
five
feet
they
were
aged
from
two
hundred
and
fifty
to
six
hundred
years
most
of
the
old
ones
have
lived
through
several
fires
i
dissected
a
fallen
veteran
that
grew
on
the
vrain
watershed
at
an
altitude
of
eight
thousand
feet
that
was
feet
high
and
inches
in
diameter
five
feet
from
the
ground
it
showed
six
hundred
and
annual
rings
during
the
first
three
hundred
years
of
its
life
it
averaged
an
inch
of
diameter
growth
every
ten
years
it
had
been
through
many
forest
fires
and
showed
large
one
of
these
it
received
at
the
age
of
three
hundred
and
years
it
carried
another
scar
which
it
received
two
hundred
and
sixteen
years
before
its
death
another
which
it
received
in
and
a
fourth
which
it
received
fourteen
years
before
it
blew
over
in
the
autumn
of
all
of
these
were
on
the
same
quarter
of
the
tree
all
were
on
that
part
of
the
tree
which
overlooked
the
hillside
forest
fires
where
there
is
opportunity
sweep
up
the
against
the
lower
side
of
the
trees
the
lower
side
is
thus
often
scarred
while
the
opposite
side
is
scarcely
injured
but
wind
blowing
down
the
gulch
at
the
time
of
each
fire
may
have
directed
the
flames
against
the
lower
side
of
this
tree
in
many
places
clusters
of
young
trees
were
growing
close
to
the
lower
side
of
the
old
trees
and
were
enabled
to
grow
there
by
light
that
came
in
from
the
side
it
may
be
that
the
heat
from
one
of
the
blazing
clusters
scarred
this
old
pine
then
another
young
cluster
may
have
grown
to
be
in
time
also
consumed
but
these
scars
may
have
resulted
wholly
or
in
part
from
other
causes
yellow
pine
claims
the
major
portion
of
the
slopes
except
those
that
are
northerly
in
the
middle
up
to
the
lower
margin
a
few
groves
are
found
higher
than
nine
thousand
feet
douglas
spruce
covers
many
of
the
northerly
slopes
that
lie
between
six
thousand
and
nine
thousand
feet
the
regularity
of
over
the
mountains
is
to
me
a
source
of
interest
though
the
various
species
of
trees
appear
to
be
growing
almost
at
random
yet
each
species
shows
a
decided
preference
for
peculiar
altitude
soil
temperature
and
moisture
conditions
it
is
an
interesting
demonstration
of
tree
adaptability
to
follow
a
stream
which
comes
out
of
the
west
in
the
middle
and
observe
how
unlike
the
trees
are
which
thrive
on
opposite
sides
on
the
southerly
slopes
that
come
down
to
the
water

an
open
forest
of
yellow
pine
and
on
the
opposite
side
the
south
bank
a
dense
forest
of
douglas
spruce
if
one
be
told
the
altitude
the
slope
and
the
moisture
conditions
of
a
place
on
the
rockies
he
should
if
acquainted
with
the
rockies
be
able
to
name
the
kinds
of
trees
growing
there
some
trees
grow
only
in
moist
places
others
only
in
dry
places
some
never
below
or
above
a
certain
altitude
indeed
so
regular
is
the
over
the
rockies
that
i
feel
certain
if
i
were
to
awaken
from
a
rip
van
winkle
sleep
in
the
forests
on
the
middle
or
upper
slopes
of
these
mountains
i
could
after
examining
a
few
of
the
trees
around
me
tell
the
points
of
the
compass
the
altitude
above
and
the
season

an
altitude
of
about
hundred
feet
cottonwood
which
has
accompanied
the

foothills
begins
to
be

the
aspen
is
found
growing
in
groups
and
groves
from
this
altitude
up
to
usually
in
the
moister
places
to
me
the
aspen
is
almost
a
classic
tree
and
i
have
met
it
in
so
many
places
that
i
regard
it
almost
as
an
old
friend
it
probably
rivals
the
juniper
in
being
the
most
widely
distributed
tree
on
the
north
american
continent
it
also
vies
with
the
pine
in
quickness
of
taking
possession
of
areas
let
a
moist
place
be
burned
over
and
the
aspen
will
quickly
take
possession
and
soon
establish
conditions
which
will
allow
conifers
to
return
this
the
conifers
do
and
in
a
very
short
time
smother
the
aspens
that
made
it
possible
for
them
to
start
in
life
the
good
nursery
work
of
aspens
is
restricted
pretty
closely
to
damp
places
besides
being
a
useful
tree
the
little
aspen
with
its
restless
and
childlike
ways
is
a
tree
that
it
is
good
to
know
when
alone
these
little
trees
seem
lonely
and
sometimes
to
tremble
as
though
just
a
little
afraid
in
this
big
strange
world
but
generally
the
aspen
is
not
alone
usually
you
find
a
number
of
little
aspens
playing
together
with
their
leaves
shaking
jostling
and
jumping
moving
all
the
time
if
you
go
near
a
group
and
stop
to
watch
them
they
may
for
an
instant
pause
to
glance
at
you
then
turn
to
romp
more
merrily
than
before
and
they
have
other
childlike
ways
besides
bare
legs
and
activity
on
some
summer
day
if
you
wish
to
find
these
little
trees
look
for
them
where
you
would
for
your
own
child
wading
the
muddiest
place
to
be
found
they
like
to
play
in
the
swamps
and
may
often
be
seen
in
a
line
alongside
a
brook
with
toes
in
the
water
as
though
looking
for
the
deepest
place
before
wading
in
one
day
i
came
across
a
party
of
merry
little
aspens
who
were
in
a
circle
around
a
grand
old
pine
as
though
using
the
pine
for
a
maypole
to
dance
around
it
was
in
autumn
and
each
little
aspen
wore
its
gayest
colors
some
were
in
gowns
of
the
grizzled
old
pine
like
an
old
man
in
the
autumn
of
his
life
looked
down
as
though
honored
and
pleased
with
the
happy
little
ones
who
seemed
so
full
of
joy
i
watched
them
for
a
time
and
went
on
across
the
mountains
but
i
have
long
believed
in
fairies
so
the
next
day
i
went
back
to
see
this
fairyland
and
found
the
dear
little
aspens
still
shaking
their
golden
leaves
while
the
old
pine
stood
still
in
the
sunlight
along
the
streams
between
the
altitudes
of
hundred
and
hundred
feet
one
finds

colorado
blue
or
silver
spruce
this
tree
grows
in
twos
or
threes
occasionally
forming
a
small
grove
usually
it
is
found
growing
near
a
river
or
brook
standing
closely
to
a
crag
in
surroundings
which
emphasize
its
beauty
of
form
and
color
with
its
fluffy
robe
and
its
garlands
of
cones
it
is
the
handsomest
tree
on
the
rockies
it
is
the
queen
of

the
presence
in
places

suggests
that
these
severe

may
be
developing
hardier
trees
than
any
that
now
are
growing
on
this
forest
frontier
if
this
be
true
then
on
the
rockies
is
yet
to
gain
a
higher
limit
since
the
day
of
pike
peak
or
bust
fires
have
swept
over
more
than
half
of
the
primeval
forest
area
in
colorado
some
years
ago
while
making
special
efforts
to
prevent
forest
fires
from
starting
i
endeavored
to
find
out
the
cause
of
these
fires
i
regretfully
found
that
most
of
them
were
the
result
of
carelessness
and
i
also
made
a
note
to
the
effect
that
there
are
few
worse
things
to
be
guilty
of
than
carelessly
setting
fire
to
a
forest
most
of
these
forest
fires
had
their
origin
from
which
the
departing
campers
had
left
unextinguished
there
were
sixteen
fires
in
one
summer
which
i
attributed
to
the
following
causes
campers
nine
cigar
one
lightning
one
locomotive
one
stockmen
two
one
and
sawmill
one
fires
have
made
the
rocky
mountains
still
more
rocky
in
many
places
the
fires
burn
their
way
to
solid
rock
in
other
places
the
humus
or
vegetable
mould
is
partly
consumed
by
fire
and
the
remainder
is
in
a
short
time
blown
away
by
wind
or
washed
away
by
water
fires
often
leave
only
blackened
granite
rock
behind
so
that
in
many
places
they
have
not
only
consumed
the
forests
but
also
the
food
upon
which
the
new
forests
might
have
fed
many
areas
where
splendid
forests
grew
after
being
show
only
barren
granite
as
some
of
the
granite
on
the
rockies
disintegrates
slowly
it
will
probably
require
several
hundred
years
for
nature
to
resoil
and
reforest
some
of
these
places
however
upon
thousands
of
acres
of
the
rockies
millions
of
young
trees
are
just
beginning
to
grow
and
if
these
trees
be
protected
from
fire
a
forest
will
early
result
i
never
see
a
little
tree
bursting
from
the
earth
peeping
confidently
up
among
the
withered
leaves
without
wondering
how
long
it
will
live
or
what
trials
or
triumphs
it
will
have
i
always
hope
that
it
will
find
life
worth
living
and
that
it
will
live
long
to
better
and
to
beautify
the
earth
i
hope
it
will
love
the
blue
sky
and
the
white
clouds
passing
by
i
trust
it
will
welcome
all
seasons
and
ever
join
merrily
in
the
music
the
motion
and
the
movement
of
the
elemental
dance
with
the
winds
i
hope
it
will
live
with
rapture
in
the
days
of
spring
and
also
enjoy
the
quiet
summer
rain
i
hope
it
will
be
a
home
for
the
birds
and
hear
their
low
sweet
i
trust
that
when
comes
the
golden
peace
of
autumn
days
it
will
be
ready
with
fruited
boughs
for
the
life
to
come
i
never
fail
to
hope
that
if
this
tree
is
cut
down
it
may
be
used
for
a
flagpole
to
keep
our
glorious
banner
in
the
blue
above
or
that
it
may
be
built
into
a
cottage
where
love
will
abide
or
if
it
must
be
burnt
that
it
will
blaze
on
the
hearthstone
in
a
home
where
children
play
in
the
firelight
on
the
floor
in
many
places
the

more
than
three

are
not

the

holds
many
treasures
that
are
dear
to
those
who
love
flowers
and
who
appreciate
them
especially
where
cold
and
snow
keep
them
tiny
above
are
many
bright
blossoms
that
are
familiar
to
us

dwarfed

small
size

needs
to
get
down

lie
upon
the
ground

search
carefully

one
of
the
most
attractive
and
beautiful
of
these
alpine
flowers
is
the
blue
honeysuckle

polemonium
about
an

have
found
it

coloring

an
altitude
of
fourteen
thousand

climb
up
the
rockies
will
develop
a
love
for
nature
strengthen
one
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
world
outdoors
and
put
one
in
tune
with
the
infinite
it
will
inspire
one

the
feeling
that
the
rockies
have
a
rare

their
own
they
are
not
to
be
compared
with
the
selkirks

besieged
by
bears
two
old
prospectors
sullivan
and
jason
once
took
me
in
for
the
night
and
after
supper
they
related
a
number
of
interesting
experiences
among
these
tales
was
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
heard
the
story
was
told
in
the
graphic
earnest
realistic
style
so
often
possessed
by
those
who
have
lived
strong
stirring
lives
among
crags
and
pines
although
twenty
years
had
gone
by
these
prospectors
still
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
that
lively
night
when
they
were
besieged
by
three
bears
and
in
recounting
the
experience
they
mingled
many
good
of
bear
behavior
with
their
exciting
and
amusing
story
this
happened
to
us
said
sullivan
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
minding
our
own
business
and
had
never
hunted
bears
the
siege
occurred
at
their
log
cabin
during
the
spring
of
they
were
prospecting
in
geneva
park
where
they
had
been
all
winter
driving
a
tunnel
they
were
so
nearly
out
of
supplies
that
they
could
not
wait
for
snowdrifts
to
melt
out
of
the
trail
provisions
must
be
had
and
sullivan
thought
that
by
allowing
twice
the
usual
time
he
could
make
his
way
down
through
the
drifts
and
get
back
to
the
cabin
with
them
so
one
morning
after
telling
jason
that
he
would
be
back
the
next
evening
he
took
their
burro
and
set
off
down
the
mountain
on
the
way
home
next
day
sullivan
had
much
difficulty
in
getting
the
loaded
burro
through
the
snowdrifts
and
when
within
a
mile
of
the
cabin
they
stuck
fast
sullivan
unpacked
and
rolled
the
burro
out
of
the
snow
and
was
busily
repacking
when
the
animal
uneasiness
made
him
look

in

edge
of

only
a
short
distance
away
were
three
bears
apparently
a
mother
and
her
two
children
they
were
sniffing
the
air
eagerly
and
appeared
somewhat
excited
the
old
bear
would
rise
on
her
hind
paws
sniff
the

she
kept
her
nose
pointed

not
appear
to
look

all
directions
before
them
then
they
would
slowly
back
up
to
the
old
bear
they
all
seemed
very
when
sullivan
was
unpacking
the
burro
the
wrapping
had
come
off
two
hams
which
were
among
the
supplies
and
the
wind
had
carried
the
delicious
aroma
to
the
bears
who
were
just
out
of
their
winter
dens
after
weeks
of
fasting
of
course
hams
smelled
good
to
them
sullivan
repacked
the
burro
and
went
on
the
bears
quietly
eyed
him
for
some
distance
at
a
turn
in
the
trail
he
looked
back
and
saw
the
bears
clawing
and
smelling
the
snow
on
which
the
provisions
had
lain
while
he
was
getting
the
burro
out
of
the
snowdrift
he
went
on
to
the
cabin
had
supper
and
forgot
the
bears
the
log
cabin
in
which
he
and
jason
lived
was
a
small
one
it
had
a
door
in
the
side
and
a
small
window
in
one
end
the
roof
was
made
of
a
layer
of
poles
thickly
covered
with
earth
a
large
often
shared
the
cabin
with
the
prospectors
he
was
a
playful
fellow
and
sullivan
often
romped
with
him
near
their
cabin
were
some
vacant
cabins
of
other
prospectors
who
had
gone
out
for
the
winter
and
were
not
yet
back
for
summer
prospecting
the
evening
was
mild
and
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
sullivan
filled
his
pipe
opened
the
door
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
for
a
smoke
while
jason
washed
the
dishes
he
had
taken
only
a
few
pulls
at
his
pipe
when
there
was
a
rattling
at
the
window
thinking
the
dog
was
outside
sullivan
called
why
do
you
go
round
to
the
door
this
invitation
was
followed
by
a
momentary
silence
then
smash
a
piece
of
sash
and
fragments
of
flew
past
sullivan
and
rattled
on
the
floor
he
jumped
to
his
feet
in
the
dim
he
saw
a
bear
head
coming
in
through
the
window
he
threw
his
pipe
of
burning
tobacco
into
the
bear
face
and
eyes
and
then
grabbed
for
some
steel
drills
which
lay
in
the
corner
on
the
floor
the
earth
roof
had
leaked
and
the
drills
were
and
frozen
fast
to
the
floor
while
sullivan
was
dislodging
the
drills
jason
began
to
bombard
the
bear
vigorously
with
plates
from
the
table
the
bear
backed
out
she
was
looking
for
food
not
clean
plates
however
the
instant
she
was
outside
she
accepted
sullivan
invitation
and
went
round
to
the
door
and
she
came
for
it
with
a
rush
both
sullivan
and
jason
jumped
to
close
the
door
they
were
not
quick
enough
and
instead
of
one
bear
there
were
three
the
entire
family
had
accepted
the
invitation
and
all
were
trying
to
come
in
at
once
when
sullivan
and
jason
threw
their
weight
against
the
door
it
slammed
against
the
big
bear
nose
a
very
sensitive
spot
she
gave
a
savage
growl
apparently
she
blamed
the
two
other
bears
either
for
hurting
her
nose
or
for
being
in
the
way
at
any
rate
a
row
started
halfway
in
the
door
the
bears
began
to
fight
for
a
few
seconds
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
bears
would
roll
inside
sullivan
and
jason
pushed
against
the
door
with
all
their
might
trying
to
close
it
during
the
struggle
the
bears
rolled
outside
and
the
door
went
shut
with
a
bang
the
heavy
securing
was
quickly
put
into
place
but
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
an
instant
later
the
old
bear
gave
a
furious
growl
and
flung
herself
against
the
door
making
it
fairly
crack
it
seemed
as
if
the
door
would
be
broken
in
sullivan
and
jason
hurriedly
knocked
their
slab
bed
to
pieces
and
used
the
slats
and
heavy
sides
to
prop
and
strengthen
the
door
the
bears
kept
surging
and
clawing
at
the
door
and
while
the
prospectors
were
spiking
the
braces
against
it
and
giving
their
entire
attention
to
it
they
suddenly
felt
the
cabin
shake
and
heard
the
logs
strain
and
give
they
started
back
to
see
the
big
bear
struggling
in
the
window
only
the
smallness
of
the
window
had
prevented
the
bear
from
getting
in
unnoticed
and
surprising
them
while
they
were
bracing
the
door
the
window
was
so
small
that
the
bear
in
trying
to
get
in
had
almost
wedged
fast
with
hind
paws
on
the
ground
fore
paws
on
the
and
shoulders
against
the
log
over
the
window
the
big
bear
was
in
a
position
to
exert
all
her
enormous
strength
her
efforts
to
get
in
sprung
the
logs
and
gave
the
cabin
the
shake
which
warned
sullivan
grabbed
one
of
the
steel
drills
and
dealt
the
bear
a
terrible
blow
on
the
head
she
gave
a
growl
of
mingled
pain
and
fury
as
she
freed
herself
from
the
window
outside
she
backed
off
growling
for
a
little
while
things
were
calmer
sullivan
and
jason
drills
in
hand
stood
guard
at
the
window
after
some
snarling
in
front
of
the
window
the
bears
went
round
to
the
door
they
clawed
the
door
a
few
times
and
then
began
to
dig
under
it
they
are
tunneling
in
for
us
said
sullivan
they
want
those
hams
but
they
wo
get
them
after
a
time
the
bears
quit
digging
and
started
away
occasionally
stopping
to
look
hesitatingly
back
it
was
almost
eleven
and
the
full
moon
shone
splendidly
through
the
pines
the
prospectors
hoped
that
the
bears
were
gone
for
good
there
was
an
old
rifle
in
the
cabin
but
there
were
no
cartridges
for
sullivan
and
jason
never
hunted
and
rarely
had
occasion
to
fire
a
gun
but
fearing
that
the
animals
might
return
sullivan
concluded
to
go
to
one
of
the
vacant
cabins
for
a
loaded
winchester
which
he
knew
to
be
there
as
soon
as
the
bears
disappeared
he
crawled
out
of
the
window
and
looked
cautiously
around
then
he
made
a
run
for
the
vacant
cabin
the
bears
heard
him
running
and
when
he
had
nearly
reached
the
cabin
they
came
round
the
corner
of
it
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
was
up
a
pine
tree
in
an
instant
after
a
few
growls
the
bears
moved
off
and
disappeared
behind
a
vacant
cabin
as
they
had
gone
behind
the
cabin
which
contained
the
loaded
gun
sullivan
thought
it
would
be
dangerous
to
try
to
make
the
cabin
for
if
the
door
should
be
swelled
fast
the
bears
would
surely
get
him
waiting
until
he
thought
it
safe
to
return
he
dropped
to
the
ground
and
made
a
dash
for
his
own
cabin
the
bears
heard
him
and
again
gave
chase
with
the
evident
intention
of
getting
even
for
all
their
annoyances
it
was
only
a
short
distance
to
his
cabin
but
the
bears
were
at
his
heels
when
he
dived
in
through
the
broken
window
a
bundle
of
old
newspapers
was
then
set
on
fire
and
thrown
among
the
bears
to
scare
them
away
there
was
some
snarling
until
one
of
the
young
bears
with
a
stroke
of
a
fore
paw
scattered
the
blazing
papers
in
all
directions
then
the
bears
walked
round
the
out
of
sight
and
remained
quiet
for
several
minutes
just
as
jason
was
saying
i
hope
they
are
gone
for
good
there
came
a
thump
on
the
roof
which
told
the
prospectors
that
the
bears
were
still
intent
on
the
hams
the
bears
began
to
claw
the
earth
off
the
roof
if
they
were
allowed
to
continue
they
would
soon
clear
off
the
earth
and
would
then
have
a
chance
to
tear
out
the
poles
with
a
few
poles
torn
out
the
bears
would
tumble
into
the
cabin
or
perhaps
their
combined
weight
might
cause
the
roof
to
give
way
and
drop
them
into
the
cabin
something
had
to
be
done
to
stop
their
clawing
and
if
possible
get
them
off
the
roof
bundles
of
hay
were
taken
out
of
the
bed
mattress
from
time
to
time
sullivan
would
set
fire
to
one
of
these
bundles
lean
far
out
through
the
window
and
throw
the
blazing
hay
upon
the
roof
among
the
bears
so
long
as
he
kept
these
fireworks
going
the
bears
did
not
dig
but
they
stayed
on
the
roof
and
became
furiously
angry
the
supply
of
hay
did
not
last
long
and
as
soon
as
the
annoyance
from
the
bundles
of
fire
ceased
the
bears
attacked
the
roof
again
with
renewed
vigor
then
it
was
decided
to
prod
the
bears
with
drills
thrust
up
between
the
poles
of
the
roof
as
there
was
no
firewood
in
the
cabin
and
as
fuel
was
necessary
in
order
to
heat
the
drills
a
part
of
the
floor
was
torn
up
for
that
purpose
the
young
bears
soon
found
hot
drills
too
warm
for
them
and
scrambled
or
fell
off
the
roof
but
the
old
one
persisted
in
a
little
while
she
had
clawed
off
a
large
patch
of
earth
and
was
tearing
the
poles
with
her
teeth
the
hams
had
been
hung
up
on
the
wall
in
the
end
of
the
cabin
the
old
bear
was
tearing
just
above
them
jason
threw
the
hams
on
the
floor
and
wanted
to
throw
them
out
of
the
window
he
thought
that
the
bears
would
leave
contented
if
they
had
them
sullivan
thought
differently
he
said
that
it
would
take
six
hams
apiece
to
satisfy
the
bears
and
that
two
hams
would
be
only
a
taste
which
would
make
the
bears
more
reckless
than
ever
the
hams
stayed
in
the
cabin
the
old
bear
had
torn
some
of
the
poles
in
two
and
was
madly
tearing
and
biting
at
others
sullivan
was
short
and
so
were
the
drills
to
get
within
easier
reach
he
placed
the
table
almost
under
the
gnawing
bear
sprang
upon
it
and
called
to
jason
for
a
drill
jason
was
about
to
hand
him
one
when
he
noticed
a
small
bear
climbing
in
at
the
window
and
taking
the
drill
with
him
he
sprang
over
to
beat
the
bear
back
sullivan
jumped
down
to
the
fire
for
a
drill
and
in
climbing
back
on
the
table
he
looked
up
at
the
gnawed
hole
and
received
a
shower
of
dirt
in
his
face
and
eyes
this
made
him
flinch
and
he
lost
his
balance
and
upset
the
table
he
quickly
straightened
the
table
and
sprang
upon
it
drill
in
hand
the
old
bear
had
a
paw
and
arm
thrust
down
through
the
hole
between
the
poles
with
a
blind
stroke
she
struck
the
drill
and
flung
it
and
sullivan
from
the
table
he
shouted
to
jason
for
help
but
jason
with
both
young
bears
trying
to
get
in
at
the
window
at
once
was
striking
right
and
left
he
had
bears
and
troubles
of
his
own
and
did
not
heed
sullivan
call
the
old
bear
thrust
her
head
down
through
the
hole
and
seemed
about
to
fall
in
when
sullivan
in
desperation
grabbed
both
hams
and
threw
them
out
of
the
window
the
young
bears
at
once
set
up
a
row
over
the
hams
and
the
old
bear
hearing
the
fight
jumped
off
the
roof
and
soon
had
a
ham
in
her
mouth
while
the
bears
were
fighting
and
eating
sullivan
and
jason
tore
up
the
remainder
of
the
floor
and
barricaded
the
window
with
both
door
and
window
closed
they
could
give
their
attention
to
the
roof
all
the
drills
were
heated
and
both
stood
ready
to
make
it
hot
for
the
bears
when
they
should
again
climb
on
the
roof
but
the
bears
did
not
return
to
the
roof
after
eating
the
last
morsel
of
the
hams
they
walked
round
to
the
cabin
door
scratched
it
gently
and
then
became
quiet
they
had
lain
down
by
the
door
it
was
two
in
the
morning
the
inside
of
the
cabin
was
in
utter
confusion
the
floor
was
strewn
with
wreckage
bedding
drills
broken
boards
broken
plates
and
hay
were
scattered
about
sullivan
gazed
at
the
chaos
and
remarked
that
it
looked
like
poor
housekeeping
but
he
was
tired
and
asking
jason
to
keep
watch
for
a
while
he
lay
down
on
the
blankets
and
was
soon
asleep
toward
daylight
the
bears
got
up
and
walked
a
few
times
round
the
cabin
on
each
round
they
clawed
at
the
door
as
though
to
tell
sullivan
that
they
were
there
ready
for
his
hospitality
they
whined
a
little
half
but
no
one
admitted
them
and
finally
just
before
sunrise
they
took
their
departure
and
went
leisurely
smelling
their
way
down
the
trail
mountain
parks
and
the
rockies
of
colorado
cross
the
state
from
north
to
south
in
two
ranges
that
are
roughly
parallel
and
from
thirty
to
one
hundred
miles
apart
there
are
a
number
of
secondary
ranges
in
the
state
that
are
just
as
marked
as
high
and
as
interesting
as
the
main
ranges
and
that
are
in
every
way
comparable
with
them
except
in
area
the
bases
of
most
of
these
ranges
are
from
ten
to
sixty
miles
across
the
lowlands
from
which
these
mountains
rise
are
from
five
to
six
thousand
feet
above
and
the
are
from
eleven
thousand
to
thirteen
thousand
feet
above
the
tides
in
the
entire
mountain
area
of
the
state
there
are
more
than
fifty
peaks
that
are
upward
of
fourteen
thousand
feet
in
height
some
of
these
mountains
are
rounded
undulating
or
but
for
the
most
part
the
higher
slopes
and
culminating
summits
are
broken
and
angular
altogether
the
rocky
mountain
area
in
colorado
presents
a
delightful
diversity
of
parks
peaks
forests
lakes
streams
cañons
slopes
crags
and
glades
on
all
of
the
higher
summits
are
records
of
the
ice
age
in
many
places
glaciated
rocks
still
retain
the
polish
given
them
by
the
ice
king
such
rocks
as
well
as
gigantic
moraines
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
extend
from
altitudes
of
twelve
or
thirteen
thousand
feet
down
to
eight
thousand
and
in
places
as
low
as
seven
thousand
feet
some
of
the
moraines
are
but
enormous
embankments
a
few
hundred
feet
high
and
a
mile
or
so
in
length
many
of
these
are
so
raw
bold
and
bare
they
look
as
if
they
had
been
completed
or
uncovered
within
the
last
year
most
of
these
moraines
however
especially
those
below
are
well
forested
no
one
knows
just
how
old
they
are
but
geologically
speaking
they
are
new
and
in
all
probability
were
made
during
the
last
great
ice
epoch
or
since
that
time
among
the
impressive
records
of
the
ages
that
are
carried
by
these
mountains
those
made
by
the
ice
king
probably
stand
first
in
appealing
strangely
and
strongly
to
the
imagination
all
the
rocky
mountain
lakes
are
glacier
lakes
there
are
more
than
a
thousand
of
these
the
basins
of
the
majority
of
them
were
excavated
by
ice
from
solid
rock
only
a
few
of
them
have
more
than
forty
acres
of
area
and
with
the
exception
of
a
very
small
number
they
are
situated
well
up
on
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
and
between
the
altitudes
of
eleven
thousand
and
twelve
thousand
feet
the
lower
and
middle
slopes
of
the
rockies
are
without
lakes
the
lower
third
of
the
mountains
that
is
the
foothill
section
is
only
but
the
middle
portion
that
part
which
lies
between
the
altitudes
of
eight
thousand
and
eleven
thousand
feet
is
covered
by
a
heavy
forest
in
which
pine
engelmann
spruce
and
douglas
spruce
predominate
fire
has
made
ruinous
inroads
into
the
primeval
forest
which
grew
here
a
large
portion
of
the
of
the
mountains
is
made
up
of
almost
barren
rock
in
old
moraines
glaciated
slopes
or
broken
crags
granite
predominating
these
rocks
are
well
tinted
with
lichen
but
they
present
a
barren
appearance
in
places
above
the
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
the
mountains
are
covered
with
a
profuse
array
of
alpine
vegetation
this
is
especially
true
of
the
wet
meadows
or
sections
that
are
continually
watered
by
melting
snows
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
snowdrift

thousand
feet
here
and
there
above
are
many
small
areas
of
moorland
which
both
in
appearance
and
in
vegetation
seem
to
belong
in
the
tundras
of
siberia
while
these
mountains
carry
nearly
one
hundred
varieties
of
trees
and
shrubs
the
more
abundant
kinds
of
trees
number
less
than
a
score
these
are
scattered
over
the
mountains
between
the
altitudes
of
six
thousand
and
twelve
thousand
feet
while
charming
and
enlivening
the
entire
are
more
than
a
thousand
varieties
of
wild
flowers
is
abundant
on
the
rockies
no
state
east
of
the
mississippi
can
show
as
great
a
variety
as
colorado
many
species
of
birds
well
known
in
the
east
are
found
there
though
generally
they
are
in
some
way
slightly
modified
most
rocky
mountain
birds
sound
their
notes
a
trifle
more
loudly
than
their
eastern
relatives
some
of
them
are
a
little
larger
and
many
of
them
have
their
colors
slightly
intensified
many
of
the
larger
animals
thrive
on
the
slopes
of
the
rockies
deer
are
frequently
seen
bobcats
mountain
lions
and
foxes
leave
many
records
in
september
bears
find
the
bushes
and
standing
on
their
hind
legs
feed
eagerly
on
the
cherries
leaves
and
sections
of
the
twigs
the
apparently
manages
to
live
well
for
he
seems
always
fat
there
is
that
wise
little
fellow
the
coyote
he
probably
knows
more
than
he
is
given
credit
for
knowing
and
i
am
glad
to
say
for
him
that
i
believe
he
does
man
more
good
than
harm
he
is
a
great
destroyer
of
meadow
mice
he
digs
out
gophers
sometimes
his
meal
is
made
upon
rabbits
or
grasshoppers
and
i
have
seen
him
feeding
upon
wild
plums
there
are
hundreds
of
ruins
of
the
beaver
engineering
works
countless
dams
and
fillings
he
has
made
on
the
upper
vrain
he
still
maintains
his
picturesque
rustic
home
most
of
the
present
beaver
homes
are
in
high
secluded
places
some
of
them
at
an
altitude
of
eleven
thousand
feet
in
midsummer
near
most
beaver
homes
one
finds
columbines
fringed
blue
gentians
orchids
and
lupines
blooming
while
many
of
the
ponds
are
green
and
yellow
with
illustration
estes
park
and
the
big
thompson
river
from
the
top
of
mt
olympus
during
years
of
rambling
i
have
visited
and
enjoyed
all
the
celebrated
parks
of
the
rockies
but
one
which
shall
be
nameless
is
to
me
the
loveliest
of
them
all
the
first
view
of
it
never
fails
to
arouse
the
dullest
traveler
from
the
entrance
one
looks
down
upon
an
irregular
depression
several
miles
in
length
a
small
undulating
and
beautiful
mountain
valley
framed
in
peaks
with
purple
forested
sides
and
bristling
snowy
grandeur
this
valley
is
delightfully
open
and
has
a
picturesque
sprinkling
of
pines
over
it
together
with
a
few
cliffs
and
crags
its
swift
clear
and
winding
brooks
are
fringed
with
birch
and
willow
a
river
crosses
it
with
many
a
slow
and
splendid
fold
of
silver
not
only
is
the
park
enchanting
from
the
distance
but
every
one
of
its
lakes
and
meadows
forests
and
wild
gardens
has
a
charm
and
a
grandeur
of
its
own
there
are
lakes
of
many
kinds
one
named
for
the
painter
now
dead
who
many
times
sketched
and
dreamed
on
its
shores
is
a
beautiful
ellipse
and
its
entire
edge
carries
a
purple
shadow
matting
of
the
crowding
forest
its
placid
surface
reflects
peak
and
snow
cloud
and
sky
and
mingling
with
these
are
the
green
and
gold
of
glory
another
lake
is
stowed
away
in
an
utterly
wild
place
it
is
in
a
rent
between
three
granite
peaks
three
thousand
feet
of
precipice
bristle
above
it
its
shores
are
strewn
with
wreckage
from
the
cliffs
and
crags
above
and
this
is
here
and
there
cemented
together
with
winter
drifted
snow
miniature
icebergs
float
upon
its
surface
around
it
are
mossy
spaces
beds
of
sedge
and
scattered
alpine
flowers
which
soften
a
little
the
fierce
aspect
of
this
impressive
scene
on
the
western
margin
of
the
park
is
a
third
lake
this
lake
and
its
surroundings
are
of
the
highest
alpine
order
and
are
just
above
it
several
broken
and
snowy
peaks
look
down
into
it
and
splendid
spruces
spire
about
its
shores
down
to
it
from
the
heights
and
snows
above
come
waters
leaping
in
white
glory
it
is
the
centre
of
a
scene
of
wild
grandeur
that
stirs
in
one
strange
depths
of
elemental
feeling
and
wonderment
up
between
the
domes
of
one
of
the
mountains
is
gem
lake
it
is
only
a
little
crystal
pool
set
in
ruddy
granite
with
a
few
evergreens
adorning
its
rocky
shore
so
far
as
i
know
it
is
the
smallest
area
of
water
in
the
world
that
bears
the
name
of
lake
and
it
is
also
one
of
the
rarest
gems
of
the
lakelet
world
the
is
most
pleasing
and
the
groves
and
forests
are
a
delight
aged
western
yellow
pines
are
sprinkled
over
the
open
areas
of
the
park
they
have
genuine
character
marked
individuality
stocky
and
their
bark
broken
into
deep
fissures
and
plateaus
scarred
with
storm
and
fire
they
make
one
think
and
dream
more
than
any
other
tree
on
the
rockies
by
the
brooks
the
clean
and
childlike
aspens
mingle
with
the
willow
and
the
alder
or
the
handsome
silver
spruce
some
slopes
are
spread
with
the
green
fleece
of
massed
young
pines
and
here
and
there
are
groves
of
douglas
spruce
far
from
their
better
home
where
rolls
the
oregon
the
splendid
and
spiry
engelmann
spruces
climb
the
stern
slopes
eleven
thousand
feet
above
the
ocean
where
weird
with
its
dwarfed
and
distorted
trees
shows
the
incessant
line
of
battle
between
the
woods
and
the
weather
every
season
nearly
one
thousand
varieties
of
beautiful
wild
flowers
come
to
perfume
the
air
and
open
their
bannered
bosoms
to
the
sun
many
of
these
are
of
brightest
color
they
crowd
the
streams
wave
on
the
hills
shine
in
the
woodland
vistas
and
color
the
daisies
orchids
tiger
lilies
fringed
gentians
wild
red
roses
mariposas
rocky
mountain
columbines
harebells
and
adorn
every
space
and
nook
while
only
a
few
birds
stay
in
the
park
the
year
round
there
are
scores
of
summer
visitors
who
come
here
to
bring
up
the
babies
and
to
enliven
the
air
with
song
eagles
soar
the
blue
and
ptarmigan
pipits
and
sparrows
live
on
the
alpine
moorlands
thrushes
fill
the
forest
aisles
with
melody
and
by
the
brooks
the
mingles
its
music
with
the
song
of
waters
among
the
many
common
birds
are
owls
meadowlarks
robins
wrens
magpies
bluebirds
chickadees
nuthatches
and
several
members
of
the
useful
woodpecker
family
together
with
the
sparrow
and
the
willow
thrush
speckled
and
rainbow
trout
dart
in
the
streams
mountain
sheep
climb
and
pose
on
the
crags
bear
deer
and
mountain
lions
are
still
occasionally
seen
prowling
the
woods
or
hurrying
across
the
meadows
the
wise
coyote
is
also
seen
darting
under
cover
and
is
frequently
heard
during
the
night
here
among
the
evergreens
is
found
that
small
and
audacious
bit
of
intensely
interesting
and
animated
life
the
douglas
squirrel
and
also
one
of
the
dearest
of
all
small
animals
the
merry
chipmunk
along
the
brooks
are
a
few
small
beaver
colonies
a
straggling
remnant
of
a
once
numerous
population
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
picturesque
and
useful
race
will
be
allowed
to
extend
its
domain
the
park
has
also
a
glacier
a
small
but
genuine
chip
of
the
old
block
the
ice
king
the
glacier
is
well
worth
visiting
especially
late
in
summer
when
the
winter
mantle
is
gone
from
its
crevasses
leaving
revealed
its
ice
and
its
many
grottoes
it
is
every
inch
a
glacier
there
are
other
small
glaciers
above
the
park
but
these
glacial
remnants
though
interesting
are
not
as
imposing
as
the
glacial
records
the
old
works
which
were
deposited
by
the
ice
king
the
many
kinds
of
moraines
here
display
his
former
occupation
and
activities
there
are
glaciated
walls
polished
surfaces
eroded
basins
and
numerous
lateral
moraines
one
of
the
moraines
is
probably
the
largest
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
rockies
it
occupies
about
ten
square
miles
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
mountain
above
this
and
other
moraines
seem
surprisingly
fresh
and
new
as
though
they
had
been
formed
only
a
few
years
but
below
they
are
forested
and
the
accumulation
of
humus
upon
them
shows
that
they
have
long
been
bearers
of
trees
the
rugged
peak
looks
down
over
all
this
wild
garden
and
is
a
perpetual
challenge
to
those
who
go
up
to
the
sky
on
mountains
it
is
a
grand
old
granite
peak
there
are
not
many
mountains
that
require
more
effort
from
the
climber
and
few
indeed
can
reward
him
with
such
a
and
magnificent
view
illustration
in
the
uncompahgre
mountains
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
impressive
localities
in
the
rockies
lies
around
mt
wetterhorn
mt
coxcomb
and
uncompahgre
peak
here
i
have
found
the
birds
confiding
and
most
wild
animals
so
tame
that
it
was
a
joy
to
be
with
them
but
this
was
years
ago
and
now
most
of
the
wild
animals
are
wilder
and
the
birds
have
found
that
man
will
not
bear
acquaintance
most
of
this
region
was
recently
embraced
in
the
uncompahgre
national
forest
it
has
much
for
the
scientist
and
the
will
find
peaks
to
conquer
and
cañons
to
explore
the
geologist
will
find
many
valuable
stone
manuscripts
the
forester
who
interviews
the
trees
will
have
from
their
tongues
a
story
worth
while
and
here
too
are
some
of
best
pictures
for
those
who
revel
only
in
the
lovely
and
the
wild
it
is
a
strikingly
picturesque
where
there
are
many
illuminated
and
splendid
fragments
of
nature
story
he
who
visits
this
section
will
first
be
attracted
by
an
array
of
and
wander
where
he
will
grotesque
and
beautiful
shapes
in
stone
will
frequently
attract
and
interest
his
attention
the
is
made
up
of
mixtures
of
very
unequally
tempered
rock
metal
which
weathers
in
strange
weird
and
impressive
shapes
much
of
this
statuary
is
gigantic
and
uncouth
but
some
of
it
is
beautiful
there
are
minarets
monoliths
domes
spires
and
shapeless
fragments
in
places
there
are
seemingly
restive
forms
not
entirely
free
from
earth
most
of
these
figures
are
found
upon
the
crests
of
the
mountains
and
many
of
the
with
their
numerous
spikes
and
gigantic
monoliths
some
of
which
are
tilted
perilously
from
the
perpendicular
give
one
a
feeling
of
awe
some
of
the
monoliths
appear
like
broken
knotty
others
stand
straight
and
suggest
the
egyptian
obelisks
they
hold
rude
natural
hieroglyphics
in
relief
one
mountain
which
is
known
as
is
crowned
with
what
from
a
distance
seems
to
be
a
gigantic
this
fence
is
formed
by
a
row
of
monolithic
stones
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
connected
with
this
strange
locality
is
that
its
impressive
landscapes
may
be
overturned
or
blotted
out
or
new
scenes
may
be
brought
forth
in
a
day
the
mountains
do
not
stand
a
storm
well
a
hard
rain
will
dissolve
ridges
lay
bare
new
strata
undermine
and
overturn
cliffs
it
seems
almost
a
land
of
enchantment
where
old
landmarks
may
disappear
in
a
single
storm
or
an
impressive
landscape
come
forth
in
a
night
here
the
god
of
erosion
works
incessantly
and
rapidly
dissecting
the
earth
and
the
rocks
during
a
single
storm
a
hilltop
may
dissolve
a
be
fluted
with
slides
a
grove
be
overturned
and
swept
away
by
an
avalanche
or
a
lake
be
buried
forever
this
rapid
erosion
of
slopes
and
summits
causes
many
changes
and
much
upbuilding
upon
their
bases
gulches
are
filled
invaded
rivers
bent
far
to
one
side
and
groves
slowly
buried
alive
one
night
while
i
was
in
camp
on
the
slope
of
mt
coxcomb
a
prolonged
drought
was
broken
by
a
very
heavy
rain
within
an
hour
after
the
rain
started
a
large
crag
near
the
top
of
the
peak
fell
and
came
crashing
and
rumbling
down
the
slope
during
the
next
two
hours
i
counted
the
rumbling
crash
of
forty
others
i
know
not
how
many
small
avalanches
may
have
slipped
during
this
time
that
i
did
not
hear
the
next
day
i
went
about
looking
at
the
new
landscapes
and
the
strata
laid
bare
by
erosion
and
landslide
and
up
near
the
top
of
this
peak
i
found
a
large
glaciated
lava
boulder
a
lava
boulder
that
has
been
shaped
by
the
ice
and
has
for
a
time
found
a
in
a
sedentary
formation
then
been
uplifted
to
near
a
has
a
of
its
own
one
day
i
came
across
a
member
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
who
had
lost
his
way
at
my
that
evening
i
asked
him
to
hug
facts
and
tell
me
a
possible
story
of
the
glaciated
lava
boulder
the
following
is
his
account
the
shaping
of
that
boulder
must
have
antedated
by
ages
the
shaping
of
the
sphinx
and
its
story
if
acceptably
told
would
seem
more
like
fancy
than
fact
if
the
boulder
were
to
relate
briefly
its
experiences
it
might
say
i
helped
burn
forests
and
strange
cities
as
i
came
from
a
volcano
throat
and
i
was
scarcely
cool
when
disintegration
brought
flowers
to
cover
my
dead
form
by
and
by
a
long
long
winter
came
and
toward
the
close
of
it
i
was
sheared
off
ground
pushed
rolled
and
rounded
beneath
the
ice
are
you
grinding
me
up
i
asked
the
glacier
make
food
for
the
trees
and
the
flowers
during
the
earth
next
temperate
epoch
it
answered
one
day
a
river
swept
me
out
of
its
delta
and
i
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
here
i
lay
for
i
know
not
how
long
with
sand
and
boulders
piling
upon
me
here
heat
weight
and
water
fixed
me
in
a
stratum
of
materials
that
had
accumulated
below
and
above
me
my
stratum
was
displaced
before
it
was
thoroughly
solidified
and
i
felt
myself
slowly
raised
until
i
could
look
out
over
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
waves
at
once
began
to
wear
me
and
they
jumped
up
and
tore
at
me
until
i
was
lifted
above
their
reach
at
last
when
i
was
many
thousand
feet
above
the
waves
i
came
to
a
standstill
then
my
was
much
higher
than
at
present
for
a
long
time
i
looked
down
upon
a
tropical
world
i
am
now
wondering
if
the
ice
king
will
come
for
me
again
the
engelmann
spruce
forest
here
is
an
exceptionally
fine
one
and
the
geologist
and
i
discussed
it
and
trees
in
general
some
of
the
indian
tribes
of
the
rockies
have
traditions
of
a
big
fire
about
four
centuries
ago
there
is
some
evidence
of
a
general
fire
over
the
rockies
about
the
time
that
the
indian
tradition
places
it
but
in
this
forest
there
were
no
indications
that
there
had
ever
been
a
fire
trees
were
in
all
stages
of
growth
and
decay
humus
was
deep
here
i
found
a
stump
of
a
douglas
spruce
that
was
eleven
feet
high
and
about
nine
feet
in
diameter
it
was
so
decayed
that
i
could
not
decipher
the
rings
of
growth
this
tree
probably
required
at
least
a
thousand
years
to
reach
maturity
and
many
years
must
have
elapsed
for
its
wood
to
come
to
the
present
state
of
decay
over
this
stump
was
spread
the
limbs
of
a
live
tree
that
was
four
hundred
years
of
age
trees
have
tongues
and
in
this
forest
i
interviewed
many
patriarchs
had
stories
from
saplings
examined
the
mouldy
musty
records
of
many
a
family
tree
and
dug
up
some
buried
history
the
geologist
wanted
in
story
form
a
synopsis
of
what
the
records
said
and
what
the
trees
told
me
so
i
gave
him
this
account
we
climbed
in
here
some
time
after
the
retreat
of
the
last
ice
king
and
found
aspen
and
pine
in
possession
these
trees
fought
us
for
several
generations
but
we
finally
drove
them
out
for
ages
the
engelmann
spruce
family
has
had
undisputed
possession
of
this
slope
we
stand
amid
three
generations
of
mouldering
ancestors
and
beneath
these
is
the
sacred
mould
of
older
generations
still
illustration
a
among
engelmann
spruce
one
spring
when
most
of
the
present
trees
were
very
young
the
robins
as
they
flew
north
were
heard
talking
of
strange
men
who
were
exploring
the
west
indies
a
few
years
later
came
the
big
fire
over
the
rockies
which
for
months
choked
the
sky
with
smoke
fire
did
not
get
into
our
gulch
but
from
birds
and
bears
which
crowded
into
it
we
learned
that
straggling
trees
and
a
few
groves
on
the
rockies
were
all
that
had
escaped
with
their
lives
since
we
had
been
spared
we
all
sent
out
our
seed
for
as
rapidly
as
we
could
and
in
so
doing
we
received
much
help
from
the
birds
the
squirrels
and
the
bears
so
that
it
was
not
long
before
we
again
had
our
plumes
waving
everywhere
over
the
rockies
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
years
ago
an
earthquake
shook
many
of
us
down
and
wounded
thousands
of
others
with
the
rock
bombardment
from
the
cliffs
the
drought
a
century
ago
was
hard
on
us
and
many
perished
for
water
not
long
after
the
drought
we
began
to
see
the
trappers
but
they
never
did
us
any
harm
most
of
them
were
as
careful
of
our
temples
as
were
the
indians
while
the
trappers
still
roamed
there
came
a
very
snowy
winter
and
mowed
us
down
by
thousands
many
of
us
were
long
buried
beneath
the
snow
the
old
trees
became
dreadfully
alarmed
and
they
feared
that
the
ice
king
was
returning
for
weeks
they
talked
of
nothing
else
but
in
the
spring
when
the
began
to
warm
and
peel
off
in
we
had
a
real
danger
to
discuss
shortly
after
the
snowy
winter
the
came
with
their
fire
havoc
for
fifty
years
we
have
done
our
best
to
hold
our
ground
but
beyond
our
gulch
relentless
fire
and
flashing
steel
together
with
the
floods
with
which
outraged
nature
seeks
to
revenge
herself
have
slain
the
grand
majority
and
much
even
of
the
precious
dust
of
our
ancestors
has
been
washed
away
with
the
exception
of
the
night
i
had
the
geologist
my
days
and
nights
in
this
locality
were
spent
entirely
alone
the
blaze
of
the
moonlight
the
music
and
movement
of
the
winds
light
and
shade
and
the
eloquence
of
silence
all
impressed
me
more
deeply
here
than
anywhere
else
i
have
ever
been
every
day
there
was
a
delightful
play
of
light
and
shade
and
this
was
especially
effective
on
the
summits
the
light
upon
the
serrated
kept
constantly
altering
their
tone
and
outline
black
and
white
they
stood
in
midday
glare
but
a
new
grandeur
was
born
when
these
tattered
crags
appeared
above
fleeting
glimpses
of
the
crests
through
a
surging
storm
arouse
strange
feelings
and
one
is
at
bay
as
though
having
just
awakened
amid
the
vast
and
vague
on
another
planet
but
when
the
long
white
evening
light
streams
from
the
west
between
the
minarets
and
the
black
buttressed
crags
wear
the
alpine
glow
one
feelings
are
too
deep
for
words
the
wind
sometimes
flowed
like
a
torrent
across
the
ridges
surging
and
ripping
between
the
minarets
then
bearing
down
like
an
avalanche
upon
the
purple
sylvan
ocean
where
it
tossed
the
trees
with
boom
roar
and
wild
commotion
i
usually
camped
where
it
showed
the
most
enthusiasm
here
i
often
enjoyed
the
songs
or
the
fierce
activities
of
the
wind
the
absence
and
the
presence
of
wind
ever
stirred
me
strongly
weird
and
strange
are
the
feelings
that
flow
as
the
winds
sweep
and
sound
through
the
trees
the
storm
king
has
a
bugle
at
his
lips
and
a
deep
elemental
hymn
is
sung
while
the
blast
surges
wild
through
the
pines
mother
nature
is
quietly
singing
singing
soft
and
low
while
the
breezes
pause
and
play
in
the
pines
from
the
past
one
has
been
ever
coming
with
the
future
destined
ever
to
go
when
with
centuries
of
worshipful
silence
one
waits
for
the
winds
in
the
pines
ever
the
good
old
world
grows
better
both
with
songs
and
with
silence
in
the
pines
here
the
energy
and
eloquence
of
silence
was
at
its
best
that
presence
called
silence
has
its
happy
home
within
the
forest
silence
sounds
rhythmic
to
all
and
attunes
all
minds
to
the
strange
message
the
rhapsody
of
the
universe
silence
is
almost
as
kind
to
mortals
as
its
sweet
sister
sleep
a
primeval
spruce
forest
crowds
all
the
of
the
uncompahgre
region
from
an
altitude
of
eight
thousand
feet
to
so
dense
is
this
forest
that
only
straggling
bits
of
ever
fall
to
the
ground
beneath
these
spiry
crowding
trees
one
has
only
the
twilight
of
the
forest
noon
this
forest
when
seen
from
seems
to
be
a
great
ragged
purple
robe
hanging
in
folds
from
the
while
down
through
it
the
white
streams
rush
a
few
crags
pierce
it
dot
its
expanse
at
intervals
and
here
and
there
it
is
rent
with
a
vertical
avalanche
lane
many
a
happy
journey
and
delightful
climb
i
have
had
in
the
mountains
all
alone
by
moonlight
and
in
the
uncompahgre
district
i
had
many
a
moonlight
ramble
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
alone
on
high
peaks
with
the
moon
and
i
have
felt
the
spell
that
holds
the
lonely
wanderer
when
on
a
still
night
he
feels
the
wistful
tender
touch
of
the
summer
air
while
the
leaves
whisper
and
listen
in
the
moonlight
and
the
etchings
of
the
pines
fall
upon
the
magic
forest
floor
one
of
the
best
moonlit
times
that
i
have
had
in
this
region
was
during
my
last
visit
to
it
one
october
night
i
camped
in
a
in
the
depths
of
a
spruce
forest
the
white
moon
rose
grandly
from
behind
the
minareted
mountain
hesitated
for
a
moment
among
the
then
tranquilly
floated
up
into
space
it
was
a
still
night
there
was
silence
in
the
treetops
the
river
near
by
faintly
murmured
in
repose
everything
was
at
rest
the
was
full
of
romantic
light
and
on
its
eastern
margin
was
an
etching
of
spiry
spruce
a
dead
and
broken
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
looked
like
a
weird
prowler
just
out
of
the
woods
and
seemed
to
come
out
into
the
light
and
speak
to
me
all
was
still
the
moonlit
mist
clung
fantastically
to
the
mossy
festoons
of
the
fir
trees
i
was
miles
from
the
nearest
human
soul
and
as
i
stood
in
the
enchanting
scene
amid
the
beautiful
mellow
light
i
seemed
to
have
been
wafted
back
into
the
age
the
silence
was
softly
invaded
by
zephyrs
whispering
in
the
treetops
and
a
few
moonlit
clouds
that
showed
shadow
came
lazily
drifting
along
the
bases
of
the
minarets
as
though
they
were
looking
for
some
place
in
particular
although
in
no
hurry
to
find
it
heavier
followed
and
these
floated
on
the
forest
sea
touching
the
treetops
with
the
gentleness
of
a
lover
hand
i
lay
down
by
my
to
let
my
fancy
frolic
and
fairest
dreams
came
on
it
was
while
camping
once
on
the
slope
of
mt
coxcomb
that
i
felt
most
strongly
the
spell
of
the
i
wish
every
one
could
have
a
night
by
a
by
mother
nature
old
hearthstone
when
one
sits
in
the
forest
within
the
magic
tent
of
light
amid
the
silent
sculptured
trees
there
go
thrilling
through
one
blood
all
the
trials
and
triumphs
of
our
race
the
blazing
wood
the
ragged
and
changing
flame
the
storms
and
calms
the
mingling
smoke
and
blaze
the
that
dance
against
the
trees
the
scenes
and
figures
in
the
fire
with
these
though
all
are
new
and
strange
yet
you
feel
at
home
once
more

the
