i
once
upon
a
time
in
colorado
lived
a
man
named
abednego
danner
and
his
wife
matilda
abednego
danner
was
a
professor
of
biology
in
a
small
college
in
the
town
of
indian
creek
he
was
a
spindling
wisp
of
a
man
with
a
nature
drawn
well
into
itself
by
the
assaults
of
the
world
and
particularly
of
the
grim
danner
who
understood
nothing
and
undertook
all
nevertheless
these
two
lived
modestly
in
a
frame
house
on
the
hem
of
indian
creek
and
they
appeared
to
be
a
settled
and
peaceful
couple
the
chief
obstacle
to
danner
placid
dominion
of
her
hearth
was
professor
danner
laboratory
which
occupied
a
room
on
the
first
floor
of
the
house
it
was
the
one
impregnable
redoubt
in
her
domestic
stronghold
neither
threat
nor
entreaty
would
drive
him
and
what
she
termed
his
stinking
unchristian
unhealthy
dinguses
from
that
room
after
he
had
lectured
vaguely
to
his
classes
on
the
structure
of
the
and
the
law
discovered
by
mendel
he
would
shut
the
door
behind
himself
and
all
the
fury
of
the
stalwart
woman
could
not
drive
him
out
until
his
own
obscure
ends
were
served
it
never
occurred
to
professor
danner
that
he
was
a
great
man
or
a
genius
his
alarm
at
such
a
notion
would
have
been
pathetic
he
was
so
fascinated
by
the
trend
of
his
thoughts
and
experiments
in
fact
that
he
scarcely
realized
by
what
degrees
he
had
outstripped
a
world
that
wore
picture
hats
hobble
skirts
and
straps
beneath
its
trouser
legs
however
as
the
century
turned
and
the
fashions
changed
he
was
carried
further
from
them
which
was
just
as
well
on
a
certain
sunday
he
sat
beside
his
wife
in
church
singing
snatches
of
the
hymns
in
a
doleful
and
untrue
voice
and
meditating
during
the
long
sermon
on
the
structure
of
chromosomes
she
bolt
upright
and
overshadowing
him
like
a
coffin
in
the
pew
rigid
lest
her
black
silk
rustle
thrilled
in
some
corner
of
her
mind
at
the
picture
of
hell
and
salvation
danner
thoughts
turned
to
professor
mudge
whose
barren
pate
showed
above
the
congregation
a
few
rows
ahead
of
him
there
he
said
to
himself
sat
a
stubborn
and
unenlightened
man
and
so
when
the
weekly
tyranny
of
church
was
ended
he
asked
mudge
to
dinner
that
he
accomplished
by
an
argument
with
his
wife
audible
the
length
of
the
aisle
they
walked
to
the
danner
residence
danner
changed
her
clothes
hurriedly
basted
the
roast
made
milk
sauce
for
the
string
beans
and
set
three
places
they
went
into
the
danner
carved
the
mint
jelly
was
passed
the
bread
the
butter
the
gravy
and
danner
dropped
out
of
the
conversation
after
guying
her
husband
on
his
lack
of
skill
at
his
task
of
carving
mudge
opened
with
the
usual
comment
well
abednego
how
are
the
radicals
progressing
his
host
chuckled
excellently
thanks
some
day
i
be
ready
to
jolt
you
hidebound
biologists
into
your
senses
mudge
left
eyebrow
lifted
so
still
the
same
thing
i
take
it
still
believe
that
chemistry
controls
human
destiny
almost
ready
to
demonstrate
it
danner
replied
along
what
lines
muscular
strength
and
the
nervous
discharge
of
energy
mudge
slapped
his
thigh
ho
ho
nervous
discharge
of
energy
you
assume
the
human
body
to
be
a
voltaic
pile
eh
that
good
i
have
to
tell
gropper
he
enjoy
it
danner
in
some
embarrassment
gulped
a
huge
mouthful
of
meat
why
not
he
said
look
at
the
insects
the
ants
strength
a
hundred
times
our
own
an
ant
can
carry
a
large
spider
yet
an
ant
is
tissue
and
fiber
like
a
man
if
a
man
could
be
given
the
same
sinews
he
could
walk
off
with
his
own
house
ha
ha
there
a
good
one
maybe
you
do
it
abednego
possibly
possibly
and
you
would
make
a
splendid
pianos
pooh
consider
the
grasshoppers
make
a
man
as
strong
as
a
grasshopper
and
he
be
able
to
leap
over
a
church
i
tell
you
there
is
something
that
determines
the
quality
of
every
muscle
and
nerve
find
it
transplant
it
and
you
have
the
solution
mirth
overtook
professor
mudge
in
a
series
of
paroxysms
from
which
he
emerged
rubicund
and
witty
probably
your
grasshopper
man
will
look
like
a
grasshopper
more
insect
than
man
at
least
danner
you
have
imagination
few
people
have
danner
said
and
considered
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
his
wife
interrupted
at
that
point
i
think
this
nonsense
has
gone
far
enough
it
is
wicked
to
tamper
with
god
creatures
it
is
wicked
to
discuss
such
matters
especially
on
the
sabbath
abednego
i
wish
you
would
give
up
your
work
in
the
laboratory
danner
cranium
was
overlarge
and
his
neck
small
but
he
stiffened
it
to
hold
himself
in
a
posture
of
dignity
never
his
wife
gazed
from
the
defiant
pose
to
the
locked
door
visible
through
the
parlour
she
stirred
angrily
in
her
clothes
and
speared
a
morsel
of
food
you
be
punished
for
it
later
in
the
day
mudge
and
gropper
laughed
heartily
at
the
expense
of
the
former
erstwhile
host
danner
read
restively
he
was
forbidden
to
work
on
the
sabbath
it
was
his
only
compromise
matilda
danner
turned
the
leaves
of
the
bible
and
meditated
in
a
partial
vacuum
of
on
monday
danner
hastened
home
from
his
classes
during
the
night
he
had
had
a
new
idea
and
a
new
idea
was
a
rare
thing
after
fourteen
years
of
groping
investigation
alkaline
radicals
he
murmured
as
he
crossed
his
lawn
he
considered
a
group
of
bodies
he
had
no
name
for
them
they
were
the
determinants
of
which
he
had
talked
he
locked
the
laboratory
door
behind
himself
and
bent
over
the
microscope
he
had
designed
huh
he
said
an
hour
later
while
he
stirred
a
solution
in
a
beaker
he
said
huh
again
he
repeated
it
when
his
wife
called
him
to
dinner
the
room
was
a
maze
of
test
tubes
bottles
burners
retorts
instruments
during
the
meal
he
did
not
speak
afterwards
he
resumed
work
at
twelve
he
prepared
six
tadpole
eggs
and
put
them
to
hatch
it
would
be
his
three
hundred
and
separate
tadpole
hatching
then
one
day
in
june
danner
crossed
the
campus
with
unusual
haste
birds
were
singing
a
gentle
wind
eddied
over
the
town
from
the
slopes
of
the
rocky
mountains
flowers
bloomed
the
professor
did
not
heed
the
reburgeoning
of
nature
a
strange
thing
had
happened
to
him
that
morning
he
had
peeped
into
his
workroom
before
leaving
for
the
college
and
had
come
suddenly
upon
a
phenomenon
one
of
the
tadpoles
had
hatched
in
its
aquarium
he
observed
it
eagerly
first
because
it
embodied
his
new
idea
and
second
because
it
swam
with
a
rare
activity
as
he
looked
the
tadpole
rushed
at
the
side
of
its
domicile
there
was
a
tinkle
and
a
splash
it
had
swum
through
the
plate
glass
for
an
instant
it
lay
on
the
floor
then
with
a
flick
of
its
tail
it
flew
into
the
air
and
hit
the
ceiling
of
the
room
good
lord
danner
said
old
years
of
work
were
at
an
end
new
years
of
excitement
lay
ahead
he
snatched
the
creature
and
it
wriggled
from
his
grasp
he
caught
it
again
his
fist
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
hold
it
he
left
it
flopping
in
leaps
and
went
to
class
with
considerable
suppressed
agitation
and
some
reluctance
the
determinant
was
known
he
had
made
a
living
creature
abnormally
strong
when
he
reached
his
house
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
laboratory
he
found
that
four
tadpoles
in
all
had
hatched
before
they
expired
in
the
unfamiliar
element
of
air
they
had
demolished
a
quantity
of
apparatus
danner
knocked
on
the
door
what
been
going
on
in
there
nothing
her
husband
answered
nothing
it
sounded
like
nothing
what
have
you
got
there
a
cat
no
yes
well
i
wo
have
such
goings
on
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
danner
collected
the
débris
he
buried
the
tadpoles
one
was
dissected
first
then
he
wrote
for
a
long
time
in
his
notebook
after
that
he
went
out
and
with
some
difficulty
secured
a
pregnant
cat
a
week
later
he
chloroformed
the
tabby
and
inoculated
her
then
he
waited
he
had
been
patient
for
a
long
time
it
was
difficult
to
be
patient
now
when
the
kittens
were
born
into
this
dark
and
dreary
world
danner
assisted
as
sole
obstetrician
in
their
first
hours
nothing
marked
them
as
unique
the
professor
selected
one
and
drowned
the
remainder
he
remembered
the
tadpoles
and
made
a
simple
calculation
when
the
kitten
was
two
weeks
old
and
its
eyes
opened
it
was
dieting
on
all
its
mother
milk
and
more
besides
the
professor
considered
that
fact
significant
then
one
day
it
committed
matricide
probably
the
playful
blow
of
its
front
paw
was
intended
in
the
best
spirit
certainly
the
old
tabby
receiving
it
was
not
prepared
for
such
violence
from
its
offspring
danner
gasped
the
kitten
had
unseamed
its
mother
in
a
swift
and
horrid
manner
he
put
the
cat
out
of
its
misery
and
tended
the
kitten
with
trepidation
it
grew
it
ate
beefsteaks
and
chops
bone
and
all
when
it
reached
three
weeks
it
began
to
jump
alarmingly
the
laboratory
was
not
large
enough
the
professor
brought
it
its
food
with
the
expression
of
a
man
offering
a
wax
sausage
to
a
hungry
panther
on
a
peaceful
friday
evening
danner
built
a
fire
to
stave
off
the
rigours
of
a
cold
snap
he
and
danner
sat
beside
the
friendly
blaze
her
sewing
was
in
her
lap
and
in
his
was
a
book
to
which
he
paid
scant
attention
the
kitten
behind
its
locked
door
thumped
and
mewed
it
hungry
danner
said
if
you
must
keep
a
cat
why
do
you
feed
it
i
do
he
answered
he
refrained
for
politic
reasons
from
mentioning
what
and
how
much
he
fed
it
the
kitten
mewed
again
well
she
repeated
it
sounds
hungry
danner
fidgeted
the
laboratory
was
unheated
and
consequently
chilly
from
its
gloomy
interior
the
kitten
peered
beneath
the
door
and
saw
the
fire
it
sensed
warmth
the
feline
affinity
for
hearths
drew
it
one
paw
scratched
tentatively
on
the
door
it
cold
danner
said
why
do
you
bring
it
here
no
i
want
it
here
take
it
a
cover
it
it
has
a
cover
danner
did
not
wish
to
go
into
that
dark
room
the
kitten
scratched
again
and
then
it
became
earnest
there
was
a
splitting
rending
sound
the
bottom
panel
of
the
door
was
torn
away
and
it
emerged
nonchalantly
crossing
the
room
and
curling
up
by
the
fire
for
five
minutes
danner
sat
motionless
her
eyes
at
length
moved
from
the
kitten
to
her
husband
quivering
face
and
then
to
the
broken
door
on
his
part
he
made
no
move
the
kitten
was
a
scant
six
inches
from
his
foot
danner
rose
she
went
to
the
door
and
studied
the
orifice
prying
at
it
with
her
fingers
as
if
to
measure
the
strength
by
her
own
then
she
turned
the
key
and
peered
into
the
gloom
that
required
either
consummate
nerve
or
great
curiosity
after
her
inspection
she
sat
down
again
ten
minutes
passed
danner
cleared
his
throat
then
she
spoke
so
you
done
it
done
what
he
asked
innocently
you
made
all
this
rubbish
you
been
talking
about
strength
happen
to
that
kitten
it
was
rubbish
evidently
at
that
crisis
danner
toe
trembled
and
the
kitten
believing
it
a
new
toy
curled
its
paws
over
the
shoe
there
was
a
sound
of
tearing
leather
and
the
shoe
came
apart
fortunately
the
foot
inside
it
was
not
hurt
severely
danner
did
not
dare
to
budge
he
heard
his
startled
inhalation
danner
did
not
resume
her
sewing
she
breathed
heavily
and
slow
fire
crept
into
her
cheeks
the
enormity
of
the
crime
overcame
her
and
she
perceived
that
the
hateful
laboratory
had
invaded
her
portion
of
the
house
moreover
her
sturdy
religion
had
been
desecrated
danner
read
her
thoughts
do
be
angry
he
said
beads
of
perspiration
gathered
on
his
brow
angry
the
kitten
stirred
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
angry
and
why
not
here
you
defied
god
and
man
and
made
that
creature
of
the
devil
you
overrun
my
house
you
a
wicked
wicked
man
and
as
for
that
cat
i
wo
have
it
i
wo
stand
for
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
her
voice
rose
to
a
scream
do
do
plenty
and
right
here
and
now
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
and
came
back
with
a
broom
she
flung
the
front
door
wide
her
blazing
eyes
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
kitten
to
her
it
had
become
merely
an
obnoxious
little
animal
scat
you
little
demon
the
broom
came
down
on
the
cat
back
with
a
jarring
thud
after
that
chaos
a
ball
of
fur
lashed
through
the
air
bird
cage
bookcase
morris
chair
flew
asunder
then
the
light
went
out
in
the
darkness
a
comet
a
hurricane
ricochetted
through
the
room
then
there
was
a
crash
mightier
than
the
others
followed
by
silence
when
danner
was
able
he
picked
himself
up
and
lighted
the
lamp
his
wife
lay
on
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
he
revived
her
she
sat
up
and
wept
silently
over
the
wreck
of
her
parlour
danner
paled
a
round
hole
a
hole
that
could
have
been
made
by
nothing
but
a
solid
cannon
shot
showed
where
the
kitten
had
left
the
room
through
the
wall
danner
eyes
were
her
breath
came
jerkily
with
incredulous
little
gestures
she
picked
herself
up
and
gazed
at
the
hole
a
draught
blew
through
it
danner
stuffed
it
with
a
rug
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
said
if
it
comes
back
we
call
it
samson
and
as
soon
as
samson
felt
the
gnawing
of
appetite
he
returned
to
his
rightful
premises
danner
fed
him
her
face
was
pale
and
her
hands
trembled
horror
and
fascination
fought
with
each
other
in
her
soul
as
she
offered
the
food
her
husband
was
in
his
classroom
nervously
trying
to
fix
his
wits
on
the
subject
of
the
day
kitty
kitty
poor
little
kitty
she
said
samson
purred
and
drank
a
quart
of
milk
she
concealed
her
astonishment
from
herself
danner
universe
was
undergoing
a
transformation
at
three
in
the
afternoon
the
kitten
scratched
away
the
screen
door
on
the
back
porch
and
entered
the
house
danner
fed
it
the
supper
meat
danner
saw
it
when
he
returned
it
was
chasing
flies
in
the
yard
he
stood
in
awe
the
cat
could
spring
twenty
or
thirty
feet
with
ease
then
the
sharp
spur
of
dread
entered
him
suppose
someone
saw
and
asked
questions
he
might
be
arrested
taken
to
prison
something
would
happen
he
tried
to
analyze
and
solve
the
problem
night
came
the
cat
was
allowed
to
go
out
unmolested
in
the
morning
the
town
of
indian
creek
rose
to
find
that
six
large
dogs
had
been
slain
during
the
dark
hours
a
panther
had
come
down
from
the
mountains
they
said
and
danner
lectured
with
a
dry
tongue
and
errant
mind
it
was
will
hoag
farmer
of
the
fifth
generation
resident
of
the
environs
of
indian
creek
and
addict
who
bent
himself
most
mercilessly
on
the
capture
of
the
alleged
panther
his
suffered
thrice
and
then
his
after
four
such
depredations
he
cleaned
his
rifle
and
undertook
a
vigil
from
a
spot
behind
the
barn
an
old
moon
rose
late
and
illuminated
his
pastures
with
a
blue
glow
he
drank
occasionally
from
a
jug
to
ward
off
the
evil
effects
of
the
night
air
some
time
after
twelve
his
attention
was
distracted
from
the
jug
by
stealthy
sounds
he
moved
toward
them
a
hundred
yards
away
his
cows
were
huddled
together
a
heap
of
dun
shadows
he
saw
a
form
which
he
mistook
for
a
weasel
creeping
toward
the
cows
as
he
watched
he
perceived
that
the
small
animal
behaved
singularly
unlike
a
weasel
it
slid
across
the
earth
on
taut
limbs
as
if
it
was
going
to
attack
the
cows
will
hoag
repressed
a
guffaw
then
the
farmer
short
hair
bristled
the
cat
sprang
and
landed
on
the
neck
of
the
nearest
cow
and
clung
there
its
paw
descended
there
was
a
horrid
sound
of
ripping
flesh
a
moan
the
thrashing
of
hoofs
a
blot
of
dribbling
blood
and
the
cat
began
to
gorge
on
its
prey
hoag
believed
that
he
was
intoxicated
that
delirium
tremens
had
overtaken
him
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
marauder
ignored
him
slowly
unbelievingly
he
raised
his
rifle
and
fired
the
bullet
knocked
the
cat
from
its
perch
hoag
went
forward
and
picked
it
up
god
almighty
he
whispered
the
bullet
had
not
penetrated
the
skin
and
suddenly
it
wriggled
in
his
hand
he
dropped
it
a
flash
of
fur
in
the
moonlight
and
he
was
alone
with
the
corpse
of
his
holstein
he
contemplated
profanity
he
considered
kneeling
in
prayer
his
joints
turned
to
water
he
called
faintly
for
his
family
he
fell
unconscious
when
danner
heard
of
that
exploit
it
was
relayed
by
jeering
tongues
who
said
the
farmer
was
drunk
and
a
panther
had
killed
the
cow
his
lips
set
in
a
line
of
resolve
samson
was
taking
too
great
liberties
it
might
attack
a
person
in
which
case
he
danner
would
be
guilty
of
murder
that
day
he
did
not
attend
his
classes
instead
he
prepared
a
relentless
poison
in
his
laboratory
and
fed
it
to
the
kitten
in
a
brace
of
meaty
chops
the
dying
agonies
of
samson
aged
seven
weeks
were
homeric
after
that
danner
did
nothing
for
some
days
he
wondered
if
his
formulæ
and
processes
should
be
given
to
the
world
but
being
primarily
a
man
of
vast
imagination
he
foresaw
hundreds
of
rash
experiments
suppose
he
thought
that
his
discovery
was
tried
on
a
lion
or
an
elephant
such
a
creature
would
be
invincible
the
tadpoles
were
dead
the
kitten
had
been
buried
he
sighed
wearily
and
turned
his
life
into
its
usual
courses
ii
before
the
summer
was
ended
however
a
new
twist
of
his
life
and
affairs
started
the
mechanism
of
the
professor
imagination
again
it
was
announced
to
him
when
he
returned
from
summer
school
on
a
hot
afternoon
he
dropped
his
portfolio
on
the
parlour
desk
one
corner
of
which
still
showed
the
of
the
miscreant
samson
and
sat
down
with
a
comfortable
sigh
abednego
his
wife
seldom
addressed
him
by
his
first
name
yes
i
i
i
want
to
tell
you
something
yes
have
you
noticed
any
difference
in
me
lately
he
had
never
noticed
a
difference
in
his
wife
when
they
reached
old
age
he
would
still
be
unable
to
discern
it
he
shook
his
head
and
looked
at
her
with
some
apprehension
she
was
troubled
what
the
matter
i
suppose
you
would
yet
she
said
but
well
i
with
child
the
professor
folded
his
upper
lip
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
with
child
pregnant
you
mean
i
going
to
have
a
baby
soon
after
their
marriage
the
timid
notion
of
parenthood
had
escaped
them
they
had
in
fact
avoided
its
mechanics
except
on
those
rare
evenings
when
tranquillity
and
the
reproductive
urge
conspired
to
imbue
him
with
courage
and
her
with
sinfulness
nothing
came
of
that
infrequent
union
they
never
expected
anything
and
now
they
were
faced
with
it
he
murmured
a
baby
faint
annoyance
moved
her
yes
that
what
one
has
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
do
know
matilda
but
i
glad
she
softened
so
am
i
abednego
then
a
hissing
spattering
sound
issued
from
the
kitchen
the
beans
danner
said
the
second
idyl
of
their
lives
was
finished
alone
in
his
bed
tossing
on
the
humid
muslin
sheets
danner
struggled
within
himself
the
hour
that
was
at
hand
would
be
short
the
logical
step
after
the
tadpoles
and
the
kitten
was
to
vaccinate
the
human
mammal
with
his
serum
to
produce
a
an
invulnerable
man
as
a
scientist
he
was
passionately
intrigued
by
the
idea
as
a
husband
he
was
dubious
as
a
member
of
society
he
was
terrified
that
his
wife
would
submit
to
the
plan
or
to
the
step
it
necessitated
was
beyond
belief
she
would
never
allow
a
sticky
tube
of
foreign
animal
matter
to
be
poured
into
her
veins
she
would
not
permit
the
will
of
god
to
be
altered
or
her
offspring
to
be
the
subject
of
experiment
another
man
would
have
laughed
at
the
notion
of
persuading
her
danner
never
laughed
at
matters
that
involved
his
wife
there
was
another
danger
if
the
child
was
female
and
became
a
woman
like
his
wife
then
the
effect
of
such
strength
would
be
awful
indeed
he
envisioned
a
militant
reformer
an
calvinist
remodelling
the
world
a
scotch
lilith
a
matronly
gabriel
a
he
shuddered
a
hundred
times
he
denied
his
science
a
hundred
and
one
times
it
begged
him
to
be
served
each
decision
to
drop
the
idea
was
followed
by
an
effort
to
discover
means
to
inoculate
her
without
her
knowledge
to
his
wakeful
ears
came
the
reverberation
of
her
snores
he
rose
and
paced
the
floor
a
scheme
came
to
him
after
that
he
was
lost
danner
was
surprised
when
her
husband
brought
a
bottle
of
blackberry
cordial
to
her
it
was
his
first
gift
to
her
in
more
than
a
year
she
was
fond
of
cordial
he
was
not
she
took
a
glass
after
supper
and
then
a
second
which
she
drank
for
him
he
smiled
nervously
and
urged
her
to
drink
it
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
when
she
finished
the
second
glass
he
watched
her
constantly
i
feel
sleepy
she
said
you
tired
he
tried
to
dissemble
the
eagerness
in
his
voice
why
do
you
lie
down
strange
she
said
a
moment
later
i
not
usually
so
so
misty
he
nodded
the
opiate
in
the
cordial
was
working
she
lay
on
the
couch
she
slept
the
professor
hastened
to
his
laboratory
an
hour
later
he
emerged
with
a
hypodermic
syringe
in
his
hand
his
wife
lay
limply
one
hand
touching
the
floor
her
stern
dark
face
was
relaxed
he
sat
beside
her
his
conscience
raged
he
hated
the
duplicity
his
task
required
his
eyes
lingered
on
the
swollen
abdomen
it
was
cryptic
enigmatic
filled
with
portent
he
jabbed
the
needle
she
did
not
stir
after
that
he
substituted
a
partly
empty
bottle
of
cordial
for
the
drugged
liquor
it
was
perhaps
the
most
practical
thing
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
danner
could
not
explain
herself
on
the
following
morning
she
belaboured
him
why
did
you
wake
me
and
make
me
go
to
bed
sleeping
in
my
clothes
i
never
did
such
a
thing
in
my
life
i
could
wake
you
i
tried
rubbish
you
were
sleeping
so
hard
you
refused
to
move
sometimes
old
as
you
are
i
like
to
thrash
you
danner
went
to
the
college
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
nothing
more
to
require
his
concentration
he
could
wait
as
he
had
waited
before
he
trembled
occasionally
with
the
hope
that
his
child
would
be
a
boy
a
sane
healthy
boy
then
in
the
end
his
work
might
bear
fruit
the
he
said
in
flat
tones
will
be
the
subject
of
study
i
want
you
gentlemen
to
diagram
the
structure
of
the
and
write
five
hundred
words
on
its
vital
principles
and
processes
it
is

interesting

it

with

and
always

growing
with
the
burden
of
her
offspring
danner
sitting
silent
watching
wondering
waiting
it
would
soon
be
time
on
christmas
morning
there
entered
into
danner
vitals
a
pain
that
was
indefinable
and
at
the
same
time
certain
it
thrust
all
thought
from
her
mind
then
it
diminished
and
she
summoned
her
husband
get
the
doctor
it
coming
danner
tottered
into
the
street
and
executed
his
errand
the
doctor
smiled
cheerfully
just
beginning
i
be
over
this
afternoon
but
good
lord
you
ca
leave
her
like
nonsense
he
came
home
and
found
his
wife
dusting
he
shook
his
head
get
nolan
she
said
then
she
threw
herself
on
the
bed
again
nolan
the
nearest
neighbour
wife
of
professor
nolan
and
mother
of
four
children
was
delighted
this
particular
christmas
was
going
to
be
a
day
of
some
excitement
she
prepared
hot
water
and
bustled
with
unessential
occupation
danner
sat
prostrate
in
the
parlour
he
had
done
it
he
had
done
more
and
that
would
be
known
later
perhaps
it
would
fail
he
hoped
it
would
fail
he
wrung
his
hands
the
concept
of
another
person
in
his
house
had
not
yet
occurred
to
him
birth
was
his
sickness
until
it
was
over
the
doctor
arrived
after
danner
had
made
his
third
trip
nolan
prepared
lunch
i
love
to
cook
in
other
people
kitchens
she
said
he
wanted
to
strike
her
curious
he
thought
at
the
industry
of
the
doctor
and
nolan
increased
and
the
silence
of
the
two
paradoxically
increased
with
it
then
the
early
twilight
fell
danner
lay
with
her
lank
black
hair
plastered
to
her
brow
she
did
not
moan
pain
twisted
and
convulsed
her
downstairs
danner
sat
and
sweated
a
cry
his
wife
another
unfamiliar
scurrying
feet
on
the
bare
parts
of
the
floor
he
looked
up
nolan
leaned
over
the
stair
well
it
a
boy
danner
a
beautiful
boy
and
husky
you
never
saw
such
a
husky
baby
it
ought
to
be
he
said
they
found
him
later
in
the
back
yard
prancing
on
the
snow
with
weird
ungainly
steps
a
vacant
smile
lighted
his
features
they
did
blame
him
iii
calm
and
quiet
held
their
negative
sway
over
the
danner
ménage
for
an
hour
and
then
there
was
a
disturbed
fretting
that
developed
into
a
lusty
bawl
the
professor
passed
a
fatigued
hand
over
his
brow
he
was
unaccustomed
to
the
dissonances
of
his
offspring
young
hugo
they
had
named
him
after
a
maternal
uncle
had
attained
the
age
of
one
week
without
giving
any
indication
of
unnaturalness
that
is
not
quite
true
he
was
as
fleshy
as
most
healthy
infants
but
the
flesh
was
more
than
normally
firm
he
was
inordinately
active
his
eyes
had
been
gray
but
already
they
gave
promise
of
the
inkiness
they
afterwards
exhibited
he
was
born
with
a
quantity
of
black
hair
hair
so
dark
as
to
be
nearly
blue
abednego
danner
on
seeing
it
exercised
the
liberty
which
all
husbands
take
and
investigated
rumours
of
his
forbears
with
his
most
secret
thoughts
the
principal
rumour
was
that
one
of
her
lusty
covenanter
grandsires
had
been
intrigued
by
a
squaw
to
the
point
of
forgetting
his
psalms
and
recalling
only
the
song
of
solomon
however
that
may
have
been
hugo
was
an
attractive
and
virile
baby
danner
spent
hours
at
the
side
of
his
crib
speculating
and
watching
for
any
sign
of
biological
variation
but
it
was
not
until
a
week
had
passed
that
he
was
given
evidence
by
that
time
he
was
ready
to
concede
the
failure
of
his
greatest
experiment
the
baby
bawled
and
presently
stopped
and
danner
who
had
put
it
to
breast
suddenly
called
her
husband
abednego
come
here
hurry
the
professor
heart
skipped
its
regular
timing
and
he
scrambled
to
the
floor
above
what
the
matter
danner
was
sitting
in
a
her
face
was
as
white
as
paper
only
in
her
eyes
was
there
a
spark
of
life
he
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
what
the
matter
he
said
again
he
looked
at
hugo
and
saw
nothing
terrifying
in
the
ravishing
hunger
which
the
infant
showed
matter
matter
you
know
the
matter
then
he
knew
and
he
realized
that
his
wife
had
discovered
i
do
you
look
frightened
shall
i
bring
some
water
danner
spoke
again
her
voice
was
icy
distant
terrible
i
came
in
to
feed
him
just
a
minute
ago
he
was
lying
in
his
crib
i
tried
to
to
hug
him
and
he
put
his
arms
out
as
god
lives
i
could
not
pull
that
baby
to
me
he
was
too
strong
abednego
too
strong
too
strong
i
could
unbend
his
little
arms
when
he
stiffened
them
i
straighten
them
when
he
bent
them
and
he
pushed
me
harder
than
you
could
push
harder
than
i
could
push
myself
i
know
what
it
means
you
have
done
your
horrible
thing
to
my
baby
he
just
a
baby
abednego
and
you
done
your
thing
to
him
how
could
you
oh
how
could
you
danner
rose
and
laid
the
baby
gently
on
the
chair
she
stood
before
her
husband
towering
over
him
raised
her
hand
and
struck
with
all
her
force
danner
fell
to
one
knee
and
a
red
welt
lifted
on
his
face
she
struck
him
again
and
he
fell
against
the
chair
little
hugo
was
dislodged
one
hand
caught
a
rung
of
the
chair
back
and
he
hung
suspended
above
the
floor
look
danner
screamed
as
they
looked
the
baby
flexed
its
arm
and
lifted
itself
back
into
the
chair
it
was
a
feat
that
a
gymnast
would
have
accomplished
with
difficulty
danner
stared
ignoring
the
blows
the
crimson
on
his
cheek
for
once
in
his
lifetime
he
suddenly
defied
his
wife
he
pointed
to
the
child
yes
look
his
voice
rang
clearly
i
did
it
i
vaccinated
you
the
night
the
cordial
put
you
to
sleep
and
there
my
son
he
strong
stronger
than
a
lion
cub
and
he
increase
in
strength
as
he
grows
until
samson
and
hercules
would
be
pygmies
beside
him
he
be
the
first
of
a
new
and
glorious
race
a
race
that
does
have
to
fear
because
it
can
not
know
harm
no
man
can
hurt
him
no
man
can
vanquish
him
he
will
be
mightier
than
any
circumstances
he
son
of
a
weak
man
will
be
stronger
than
the
beasts
even
than
the
ancient
dinosaurs
stronger
than
the
tides
stronger
than
fate
strong
as
god
is
strong
and
you
you
matilda
mother
of
him
will
be
proud
of
him
he
will
be
great
and
famous
you
can
knock
me
down
you
can
knock
me
down
a
thousand
times
i
have
given
you
a
son
whose
little
finger
you
can
not
bend
with
a
oh
all
these
years
i
listened
to
you
and
obeyed
you
and
yes
i
feared
you
a
little
and
god
must
hate
me
for
it
now
take
your
son
and
my
son
you
can
not
change
him
you
can
not
bend
him
to
your
will
he
is
all
i
might
have
been
all
that
mankind
should
be
danner
voice
broke
and
he
sobbed
he
relented
i
know
it
hard
for
you
it
against
your
religion
against
your
love
even
but
try
to
like
him
he
no
different
from
you
and
me
only
stronger
and
strength
is
a
glorious
thing
a
great
thing
then
afterwards
if
you
can
forgive
me
he
collapsed
blood
pounded
in
her
ears
she
stared
at
the
huddled
body
of
her
husband
he
had
stood
like
a
prophet
and
spoken
words
of
fire
she
was
shaken
from
her
pettiness
for
one
moment
she
had
loved
danner
in
that
same
instant
she
had
glimpsed
the
superhuman
energy
that
had
driven
him
through
the
long
years
of
discouragement
to
triumph
she
had
seen
his
soul
she
fell
at
his
feet
and
when
danner
opened
his
eyes
he
found
her
there
weeping
he
took
her
in
his
arms
timidly
clumsily
cry
mattie
it
be
all
right
you
love
him
do
you
she
stared
at
the
babe
of
course
i
love
him
wash
your
face
abednego
after
that
there
was
peace
in
the
house
and
with
it
the
child
grew
during
the
next
months
they
ignored
his
peculiarities
when
they
found
him
hanging
outside
his
crib
they
put
him
back
gently
when
he
smashed
the
crib
they
discussed
a
better
place
for
him
to
repose
no
hysteria
no
conflict
when
in
the
early
spring
young
hugo
began
to
recognize
them
and
to
assert
his
feelings
they
rejoiced
as
all
parents
rejoice
when
he
managed
to
vault
the
sill
of
the
window
by
some
antic
contortion
of
his
limbs
they
dismissed
the
episode
danner
had
been
baking
she
heard
the
child
voice
and
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
yard
startled
incredulous
she
rushed
upstairs
hugo
was
not
in
his
room
his
wail
drifted
through
the
window
she
looked
out
he
was
lying
in
the
yard
fifteen
feet
below
she
rushed
to
his
side
he
had
not
been
hurt
danner
made
a
pen
of
the
iron
heads
and
feet
of
two
old
beds
he
wired
them
together
the
baby
was
kept
in
the
inclosure
thus
formed
the
days
warmed
and
lengthened
no
one
except
the
danners
knew
of
the
prodigy
harboured
by
their
unostentatious
house
but
the
secret
was
certain
to
leak
out
eventually
nolan
the
neighbour
was
first
to
learn
it
she
had
called
on
danner
to
borrow
a
cup
of
sugar
the
call
naturally
included
a
discussion
of
various
domestic
matters
and
a
visit
to
the
baby
she
voiced
a
question
that
had
occupied
her
mind
for
some
time
why
do
you
keep
the
child
in
that
iron
thing
are
you
afraid
it
will
hurt
itself
oh
no
nolan
viewed
young
hugo
he
was
lying
on
a
large
pillow
presently
he
rolled
off
its
surface
active
youngster
is
he
very
danner
said
nervously
hugo
as
if
he
understood
and
desired
to
demonstrate
seized
a
corner
of
the
pillow
and
flung
it
from
him
it
traversed
a
long
arc
and
landed
on
the
floor
nolan
was
startled
goodness
i
never
saw
a
child
his
age
that
could
do
that
no
let
go
downstairs
i
want
to
show
you
some
tidies
i
making
nolan
paid
no
attention
she
put
the
pillow
back
in
the
pen
and
watched
while
hugo
tossed
it
out
there
something
funny
about
that
it
is
normal
have
you
seen
a
doctor
danner
fidgeted
oh
yes
little
hugo
healthy
little
hugo
grasped
the
iron
wall
of
his
miniature
prison
he
pulled
himself
toward
it
his
skirt
caught
in
the
floor
he
pulled
harder
the
pen
moved
toward
him
a
high
soprano
came
from
nolan
he
moved
it
i
do
think
i
could
move
it
myself
i
tell
you
i
going
to
ask
the
doctor
to
examine
him
you
should
let
a
child
be
like
that
danner
filled
with
consternation
sought
refuge
in
prevarication
nonsense
she
said
as
calmly
as
she
could
all
we
douglases
are
like
that
strong
children
i
had
a
grandfather
who
could
lift
a
cider
keg
when
he
was
five
two
hundred
pounds
and
more
hugo
just
takes
after
him
that
all
nolan
was
annoyed
partly
because
she
was
jealous
of
prowess
her
own
children
had
been
feeble
and
dull
partly
because
she
was
frightened
no
matter
how
strong
a
person
became
a
baby
had
no
right
to
be
so
powerful
partly
because
she
sensed
that
danner
was
not
telling
the
whole
truth
she
suspected
that
the
danners
had
found
a
new
way
to
raise
children
well
she
said
all
i
have
to
say
is
that
it
damage
him
it
strain
his
little
heart
it
do
him
a
lot
of
harm
if
i
had
a
child
like
that
i
tie
it
up
most
of
the
time
for
the
first
few
years
kate
danner
said
unpleasantly
i
believe
you
would
nolan
shrugged
well
i
glad
none
of
my
children
are
freaks
anyhow
i
get
your
sugar
in
the
afternoon
the
minister
called
he
talked
of
the
church
and
the
town
until
he
felt
his
preamble
adequate
i
was
wondering
why
you
did
bring
your
child
to
be
baptized
danner
and
why
you
could
come
to
church
now
that
it
is
old
enough
well
she
replied
carefully
the
child
is
rather
irritable
and
we
thought
we
prefer
to
have
it
baptized
at
home
it
irregular
we
prefer
it
very
well
i
afraid
he
smiled
that
you
a
little
ah
unfamiliar
with
the
upbringing
of
children
natural
in
the
case
of
the
quite
natural
but
ah
i
met
nolan
quite
by
accident
and
she
said
that
you
kept
the
child
ah
in
an
iron
pen
it
seemed
unnecessarily
cruel
to
me
did
it
danner
jaw
set
squarely
but
the
minister
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
lightly
i
afraid
if
it
true
that
we
the
church
will
have
to
do
something
about
it
you
ca
let
the
little
fellow
grow
up
surrounded
by
iron
walls
it
will
surely
point
him
toward
the
prison
little
minds
are
tender
and
ah
impressionable
we
had
a
crib
and
two
pens
of
wood
danner
answered
tartly
he
smashed
them
all
ah
so
lifted
eyebrows
temper
eh
he
should
be
punished
punishment
is
the
only
mould
for
unruly
children
you
punish
a
baby
why
certainly
i
reared
seven
by
the
rod
well
a
blazing
maternal
instinct
made
her
feel
vicious
well
you
wo
raise
mine
by
a
rod
or
touch
it
by
a
mile
here
your
hat
parson
danner
spent
the
next
hour
in
prayer
the
village
is
known
for
the
speed
of
its
gossip
and
the
sloth
of
its
intelligence
those
two
factors
explain
the
conditions
which
preluded
and
surrounded
the
dawn
of
consciousness
in
young
hugo
extemporaneous
fabrication
of
a
sturdy
ancestral
line
kept
the
more
supernatural
elements
of
the
baby
prowess
from
the
public
eye
it
became
rapidly
and
generally
understood
that
the
danner
infant
was
abnormal
and
that
the
treatment
to
which
it
was
submitted
was
not
usual
at
the
same
time
neither
the
gossips
of
indian
creek
nor
the
slightly
more
sage
professors
of
the
college
exercised
the
wit
necessary
to
realize
that
however
strong
young
hugo
might
become
it
was
neither
right
nor
just
that
his
cradle
days
be
augurs
of
that
eventual
estate
on
the
face
of
it
the
argument
seemed
logical
if
danner
forbears
had
been
men
of
peculiar
might
her
child
might
well
be
able
to
chin
itself
at
three
weeks
and
it
might
easily
be
necessary
to
confine
it
in
a
metal
pen
however
inhumane
the
process
appeared
hugo
was
sheltered
and
his
early
antics
peculiar
and
startling
as
they
were
to
his
parents
escaped
public
attention
the
little
current
of
talk
about
him
was
kept
alive
only
because
there
was
so
small
an
array
of
topics
for
the
local
burghers
but
it
was
not
extraordinarily
malicious
months
piled
up
a
year
passed
and
then
another
hugo
was
a
usually
sober
and
very
sensitive
child
abednego
danner
fear
that
his
process
might
have
created
muscular
strength
at
the
expense
of
reason
diminished
and
vanished
as
hugo
learned
to
walk
and
to
talk
and
as
he
grasped
the
rudiments
of
human
behaviour
his
high
little
voice
was
heard
in
the
house
and
about
its
lawns
they
began
to
condition
him
throughout
his
later
life
there
lingered
in
his
mind
a
memory
of
the
barriers
erected
by
his
family
he
was
told
not
to
throw
his
pillow
when
words
meant
nothing
to
him
soon
after
that
he
was
told
not
to
throw
anything
when
he
could
walk
he
was
forbidden
to
jump
his
jumps
were
shocking
to
see
even
at
the
age
of
two
and
a
half
he
was
carefully
instructed
on
his
behaviour
out
of
doors
no
move
of
his
was
to
indicate
his
difference
from
the
ordinary
child
he
was
taught
kindness
and
respect
for
people
and
property
his
every
destructive
impulse
was
carefully
curbed
that
training
was
possible
only
because
he
was
sensitive
and
naturally
susceptible
to
advice
punishment
had
no
physical
terror
for
him
because
he
could
not
feel
it
but
disfavour
anger
vexation
or
disappointment
in
another
person
reflected
itself
in
him
at
once
when
he
was
four
and
a
half
his
mother
sent
him
to
sunday
school
he
was
enrolled
in
a
class
that
sat
near
her
own
so
she
was
able
to
keep
a
careful
eye
on
him
but
hugo
did
not
misbehave
it
was
his
first
contact
with
a
group
of
children
his
first
view
of
the
larger
cosmos
he
sat
quietly
with
his
hands
folded
as
he
had
been
told
to
sit
he
listened
to
the
teacher
stories
of
jesus
with
excited
interest
on
his
third
sunday
he
heard
one
of
the
children
whisper
here
comes
the
strong
boy
he
turned
quickly
his
cheeks
red
i
not
i
not
yes
you
are
mother
said
so
hugo
struggled
with
the
two
hymn
books
on
the
table
i
ca
even
lift
these
books
he
lied
the
other
child
was
impressed
and
tried
to
explain
the
situation
later
taking
the
cause
of
hugo
weakness
against
the
charge
of
strength
but
the
accusation
rankled
in
hugo
young
mind
he
hated
to
be
different
and
he
was
beginning
to
realize
that
he
was
different
from
his
earliest
day
that
longing
occupied
him
he
sought
to
hide
his
strength
he
hated
to
think
that
other
people
were
talking
about
him
the
distinction
he
enjoyed
was
odious
to
him
because
it
aroused
unpleasant
emotions
in
other
people
he
could
not
realize
that
those
emotions
sprang
from
personal
and
group
jealousy
from
the
hatred
of
superiority
his
mother
ever
zealous
to
direct
her
son
in
the
path
of
righteousness
talked
to
him
often
about
his
strength
and
how
great
it
would
become
and
what
great
and
good
deeds
he
could
do
with
it
those
lectures
on
virtuous
crusades
had
two
uses
they
helped
check
any
impulses
in
her
son
which
she
felt
would
be
harmful
to
her
and
they
helped
her
to
become
used
to
the
abnormality
in
little
hugo
in
her
mind
it
was
like
telling
a
hunchback
that
his
hump
was
a
blessing
disguised
hugo
was
always
aware
of
the
fact
that
her
words
connoted
some
latent
evil
in
his
nature
the
motif
grew
in
danner
thoughts
until
she
sought
a
definite
outlet
for
it
one
day
she
led
her
child
to
a
keg
filled
with
sand
all
of
us
she
said
to
her
son
have
to
carry
a
burden
through
life
one
of
your
burdens
will
be
your
strength
but
that
might
can
make
right
see
that
little
keg
mmmmm
that
keg
is
temptation
can
you
say
it
temshun
every
day
in
your
life
you
must
bear
temptation
and
throw
it
from
you
can
you
bear
it
huh
can
you
pick
up
that
keg
hugo
he
lifted
it
in
his
chubby
arms
now
take
it
to
the
barn
and
back
his
mother
directed
manfully
he
walked
with
the
keg
to
the
barn
and
back
he
felt
a
little
silly
and
resentful
now
throw
temptation
as
far
away
from
you
as
you
can
danner
gasped
the
distance
he
threw
the
keg
was
frightening
you
mus
throw
it
so
far
hugo
she
said
forgetting
her
allegory
for
an
instant
you
said
as
far
as
i
can
i
can
throw
it
farther
too
if
i
wan
na
no
just
throw
it
a
little
way
when
you
throw
it
far
it
does
look
right
now
fill
it
up
with
sand
and
we
do
it
over
hugo
was
perplexed
a
vague
wish
to
weep
occupied
him
as
he
filled
the
keg
the
lesson
was
repeated
danner
had
excellent
instincts
even
if
she
had
no
real
comprehension
of
ethics
some
days
later
the
burden
of
temptation
was
exhibited
in
all
its
dramatic
passages
to
nolan
and
another
lady
again
hugo
was
resentful
and
again
he
felt
absurd
when
he
threw
the
keg
it
broke
my
nolan
said
in
a
startled
tone
how
awful
the
other
woman
murmured
and
he
just
a
child
that
made
hugo
suddenly
angry
and
he
jumped
the
woman
screamed
nolan
ran
to
tell
whomever
she
could
find
danner
whipped
her
son
and
he
cried
softly
abednego
danner
left
the
discipline
of
his
son
to
his
wife
he
watched
the
child
almost
furtively
when
hugo
was
five
danner
taught
him
to
read
it
was
a
laborious
process
and
required
an
entire
winter
but
hugo
emerged
with
a
new
world
open
to
him
a
world
which
he
attacked
with
interest
no
one
bothered
him
when
he
read
he
could
be
found
often
on
sunny
days
when
other
children
were
playing
prone
on
the
floor
puzzling
out
sentences
in
the
books
of
the
family
library
and
trying
to
catch
their
significance
during
his
fifth
year
he
was
not
allowed
to
play
with
other
children
the
neighbourhood
insisted
on
that
with
the
busybodyness
and
contrariness
of
their
kind
the
same
neighbours
insisted
that
hugo
be
sent
to
school
in
the
following
fall
when
on
the
opening
day
he
did
not
appear
the
truant
officer
called
for
him
hugo
heard
the
conversation
between
the
officer
and
his
mother
he
was
frightened
he
vowed
to
himself
that
his
abnormality
should
be
hidden
deeply
after
that
he
was
dropped
into
that
microcosm
of
human
life
to
which
so
little
attention
is
paid
by
adults
school
frightened
and
excited
hugo
for
one
thing
there
were
girls
in
school
and
hugo
knew
nothing
about
them
except
that
they
were
different
from
himself
there
were
teachers
and
they
made
one
work
whether
one
wished
to
work
or
not
they
represented
power
as
a
jailer
represents
power
the
children
feared
teachers
hugo
feared
them
but
the
lesson
of
hugo
first
six
years
was
fairly
well
planted
he
blushingly
ignored
the
direct
questions
of
those
children
whom
his
fame
had
reached
he
gave
no
reason
to
anyone
for
suspecting
him
of
abnormality
he
became
so
familiar
to
his
comrades
that
their
curiosity
gradually
vanished
he
would
not
play
games
with
them
his
mother
had
forbidden
that
but
he
talked
to
them
and
was
as
friendly
as
they
allowed
him
to
be
his
sensitiveness
and
fear
of
ridicule
made
him
a
voracious
student
he
liked
books
he
liked
to
know
things
and
to
learn
them
thus
bound
by
the
conditionings
of
his
babyhood
he
reached
the
spring
of
his
first
year
in
school
without
accident
such
tranquillity
could
not
long
endure
the
day
which
his
mother
had
dreaded
ultimately
arrived
a
lanky
farmer
son
older
than
the
other
children
in
the
first
grade
chose
a
particularly
quiet
and
balmy
recess
period
to
plague
little
hugo
the
farmer
boy
was
because
of
his
size
the
bully
and
the
leader
of
all
the
other
boys
he
had
not
troubled
himself
to
resent
hugo
exclusiveness
or
hugo
reputation
until
that
morning
when
he
found
himself
without
occupation
hugo
was
sitting
in
the
sun
his
dark
eyes
staring
a
little
sadly
over
the
laughing
rioting
children
the
boy
approached
him
hello
strong
man
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
make
his
voice
so
loud
as
to
be
generally
audible
hugo
looked
both
harmless
and
slightly
pathetic
i
not
a
strong
man
course
you
not
but
everybody
thinks
you
are
except
me
i
not
afraid
of
you
i
do
want
you
to
be
afraid
of
me
i
not
afraid
of
you
either
oh
you
are
huh
look
he
touched
hugo
chest
with
his
finger
and
when
hugo
looked
down
the
boy
lifted
his
finger
into
hugo
face
go
away
and
let
me
alone
the
tormentor
laughed
ever
see
a
fish
this
long
his
hands
indicated
a
small
fish
involuntarily
hugo
looked
at
them
the
hands
flew
apart
and
slapped
him
smartly
several
of
the
children
had
stopped
their
play
to
watch
the
first
insult
made
them
giggle
the
second
brought
a
titter
from
anna
blake
and
hugo
noticed
that
anna
blake
was
a
little
girl
with
curly
golden
hair
and
blue
eyes
secretly
hugo
admired
her
and
was
drawn
to
her
when
she
laughed
he
felt
a
dismal
loneliness
a
sudden
desertion
the
farmer
boy
pressed
the
occasion
his
meanness
had
made
i
bet
you
ai
even
strong
enough
to
fight
little
charlie
todd
commere
charlie
i
am
hugo
replied
with
slow
dignity
you
a
sissy
you
to
play
with
us
the
ring
around
hugo
had
grown
he
felt
a
tangible
ridicule
in
it
he
knew
what
it
was
to
hate
still
his
inhibitions
his
control
held
him
in
check
go
away
he
said
or
i
hurt
you
the
farmer
boy
picked
up
a
stick
and
put
it
on
his
shoulder
knock
that
off
then
strong
man
hugo
knew
the
dare
and
its
significance
with
a
gentle
gesture
he
brushed
the
stick
away
then
the
other
struck
at
the
same
time
he
kicked
hugo
shins
there
was
no
sense
of
pain
with
the
kick
hugo
saw
it
as
if
it
had
happened
to
another
person
the
tensed
with
expectation
but
the
accounts
of
what
followed
were
garbled
the
farmer
boy
fell
on
his
face
as
if
by
an
invisible
agency
then
his
body
was
lifted
in
the
air
the
children
had
an
awful
picture
of
hugo
standing
for
a
second
with
the
writhing
form
of
his
attacker
above
his
head
then
he
flung
it
aside
over
the
circle
that
surrounded
him
and
the
body
fell
with
a
thud
it
lay
without
moving
hugo
began
to
whimper
pitifully
that
was
hugo
first
fight
he
had
defended
himself
and
it
made
him
ashamed
he
thought
he
had
killed
the
other
boy
sickening
dread
filled
him
he
hurried
to
his
side
and
shook
him
calling
his
name
the
other
boy
came
to
his
arm
was
broken
and
his
sides
were
purpling
where
hugo
had
seized
him
there
was
terror
in
his
eyes
when
he
saw
hugo
face
above
him
and
he
screamed
shrilly
for
help
the
teacher
came
she
sent
hugo
to
the
blacksmith
to
be
whipped
that
in
itself
was
a
stroke
of
genius
the
blacksmith
whipped
grown
boys
in
the
high
school
for
their
misdeeds
to
send
a
child
was
crushing
but
hugo
had
risen
above
the
standards
set
by
his
society
he
had
been
superior
to
it
for
a
moment
and
society
hated
him
for
it
his
teacher
hated
him
because
she
feared
him
mothers
of
children
learning
about
the
episode
collected
to
discuss
it
in
hateful
voices
hugo
was
enveloped
in
hate
and
as
the
lash
of
the
smith
fell
on
his
small
frame
he
felt
the
depths
of
misery
he
was
a
strong
man
there
was
damnation
in
his
veins
the
minister
came
and
prayed
over
him
the
doctor
was
sent
for
and
examined
him
frantic
busybodies
suggested
that
things
be
done
to
weaken
him
what
things
they
did
not
say
and
hugo
suffering
bitterly
saw
that
if
he
had
beaten
the
farmer
boy
in
fair
combat
he
would
have
been
a
hero
it
was
the
scale
of
his
triumph
that
made
it
dreadful
he
did
not
realize
then
that
if
he
had
been
so
minded
he
could
have
turned
on
the
blacksmith
and
whipped
him
he
could
have
broken
the
neck
of
the
doctor
he
could
have
run
raging
through
the
town
and
escaped
unscathed
his
might
was
a
secret
from
himself
he
knew
it
only
as
a
curse
like
a
disease
or
a
blemish
during
the
ensuing
four
or
five
years
hugo
peculiar
trait
asserted
itself
but
once
it
was
a
year
after
his
fight
with
the
bully
he
had
been
isolated
socially
even
anna
blake
did
not
dare
to
tease
him
any
longer
shunned
and
wretched
he
built
a
world
of
young
dreams
and
confections
and
lived
in
it
with
whatever
comfort
it
afforded
one
warm
afternoon
in
a
smoky
indian
summer
he
walked
home
from
school
spinning
a
top
as
he
walked
stopping
every
few
yards
to
pick
it
up
and
to
let
its
eccentric
momentum
die
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
his
pace
thereby
was
made
very
slow
and
he
calculated
it
to
bring
him
to
his
home
in
time
for
supper
and
no
sooner
because
despite
his
vigour
chores
were
as
odious
to
him
as
to
any
other
boy
a
wagon
drawn
by
two
horses
rolled
toward
him
it
was
a
heavy
wagon
piled
high
with
and
a
man
sat
on
its
rear
end
his
legs
dangling
as
the
wagon
reached
hugo
it
jolted
over
a
rut
there
was
a
grinding
rip
and
a
crash
hugo
pocketed
his
top
and
looked
the
man
sitting
on
the
back
had
been
pinned
beneath
the
rear
axle
and
the
load
held
him
there
as
hugo
saw
his
predicament
the
man
screamed
in
agony
blood
chilled
he
stood
transfixed
a
man
jumped
out
of
a
buggy
a
negro
ran
from
a
yard
two
women
hurried
from
the
spot
in
an
instant
there
were
six
or
seven
men
around
the
broken
wagon
a
sound
of
pain
issued
from
the
mouth
of
the
impaled
man
the
knot
of
figures
bent
at
the
sides
of
the
cart
and
tried
to
lift
have
to
get
a
jack
hugo
heard
them
say
hugo
wound
up
his
string
and
put
it
beside
his
top
he
walked
mechanically
into
the
road
he
looked
at
the
legs
of
the
man
on
the
ground
they
were
oozing
blood
where
the
backboard
rested
on
them
the
men
gathered
there
were
lifting
again
without
result
hugo
caught
the
side
and
bent
his
small
shoulders
with
all
his
might
he
pulled
up
the
wagon
was
jerked
into
the
air
they
pulled
out
the
injured
man
hugo
lowered
the
wagon
slowly
for
a
moment
no
attention
was
paid
to
him
he
waited
pridefully
for
the
recognition
he
had
earned
he
dug
in
the
dirt
with
the
side
of
his
shoe
a
man
with
a
mole
on
his
nose
observed
him
funny
how
that
strength
was
just
enough
to
turn
the
balance
hugo
smiled
i
pretty
strong
he
admitted
another
man
saw
him
get
out
of
here
he
said
sharply
this
is
no
place
for
a
kid
but
i
was
the
one
i
said
beat
it
and
i
meant
beat
it
go
home
to
your
ma
slowly
the
light
went
from
hugo
eyes
they
did
not
know
they
could
not
know
he
had
lifted
more
than
two
tons
and
the
men
stood
now
waiting
for
the
doctor
telling
each
other
how
strong
they
were
when
the
instant
of
need
came
go
on
kid
run
along
i
smack
you
hugo
went
he
forgot
to
spin
his
top
he
stumbled
a
little
as
he
walked
iv
days
months
years
they
had
forgotten
that
hugo
was
different
almost
for
a
while
he
had
forgotten
it
himself
he
was
popular
in
school
he
fostered
the
unexpressed
theory
that
his
strength
had
been
a
phenomenon
of
his
childhood
one
that
diminished
as
he
grew
older
then
at
ten
it
called
to
him
for
exercise
each
day
he
rose
with
a
feeling
of
insufficiency
each
night
he
retired
unrequited
he
read
poe
the
bible
scott
thackeray
swift
defoe
all
the
books
he
could
find
he
thrilled
with
every
syllable
of
adventure
his
imagination
swelled
but
that
was
not
sufficient
he
yearned
as
a
new
england
boy
yearns
before
he
runs
away
to
sea
at
ten
he
was
a
stalwart
and
handsome
lad
his
brow
was
high
and
surmounted
by
his
peculiarly
black
hair
his
eyes
were
wide
apart
inky
unfathomable
he
carried
himself
with
the
grace
of
an
athlete
he
studied
hard
and
he
worked
hard
for
his
parents
taking
care
of
a
cow
and
chickens
of
a
stable
and
a
large
lawn
of
flowers
and
a
vegetable
garden
then
one
day
he
went
by
himself
to
walk
in
the
mountains
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
go
into
the
mountains
alone
a
that
came
half
from
himself
and
half
from
his
books
led
his
feet
along
a
narrow
leafy
trail
into
the
forest
depths
hugo
lay
down
and
listened
to
the
birds
in
the
bushes
to
the
music
of
a
brook
and
to
the
sound
of
the
wind
he
wanted
to
be
free
and
brave
and
great
by
and
by
he
stood
up
and
walked
again
an
easy
exhilaration
filled
his
veins
his
pace
increased
i
wonder
he
thought
how
fast
i
can
run
how
far
i
can
jump
he
quickened
his
stride
in
a
moment
he
found
that
the
turns
in
the
trail
were
too
frequent
for
him
to
see
his
course
he
ran
ahead
realizing
that
he
was
moving
at
an
abnormal
pace
then
he
turned
gathered
himself
and
jumped
carefully
he
was
astonished
when
he
vaulted
above
the
green
covering
of
the
trail
he
came
down
heavily
he
stood
in
his
tracks
tingling
nobody
can
do
that
not
even
an
acrobat
he
whispered
again
he
tried
jumping
straight
up
he
rose
fully
forty
feet
in
the
air
good
jesus
he
exulted
in
those
lonely
incredible
moments
hugo
found
himself
there
in
the
forest
beyond
the
eye
of
man
he
learned
that
he
was
superhuman
it
was
a
rapturous
discovery
he
knew
at
that
hour
that
his
strength
was
not
a
curse
he
had
inklings
of
his
invulnerability
he
ran
he
shot
up
the
steep
trail
like
an
express
train
at
a
rate
that
would
have
been
measured
in
miles
to
the
hour
rather
than
yards
to
the
minute
tireless
blood
poured
through
his
veins
green
streaked
at
his
sides
in
a
short
time
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
trail
he
plunged
on
careless
of
obstacles
that
would
have
stopped
an
ordinary
mortal
from
trunk
to
trunk
he
leaped
a
burned
stretch
he
flung
himself
from
a
high
rock
he
sped
like
a
shadow
across
a
knoll
he
gained
the
bare
rocks
of
the
first
mountain
and
in
the
open
where
the
horror
of
no
eye
would
tether
his
strength
he
moved
in
flying
bounds
to
its
summit
hugo
stood
there
panting
below
him
was
the
world
a
little
world
he
laughed
his
dreams
had
been
broken
open
his
depression
was
relieved
but
he
would
never
let
them
know
he
hugo
the
giant
except
perhaps
his
father
he
lifted
his
arms
to
thank
god
to
jeer
at
the
world
hugo
was
happy
he
went
home
wondering
he
was
very
hungry
hungrier
than
he
had
ever
been
and
his
parents
watched
him
eat
with
hidden
glances
samson
had
eaten
thus
as
if
his
stomach
were
bottomless
and
his
food
digested
instantly
to
make
room
for
more
and
as
he
ate
hugo
tried
to
open
a
conversation
that
would
lead
to
a
confession
to
his
father
but
it
seemed
impossible
hugo
liked
his
father
he
saw
how
his
mother
dominated
the
little
professor
how
she
seemed
to
have
crushed
and
bewildered
him
until
his
mind
was
unfocused
from
its
present
he
could
not
love
his
mother
because
of
that
he
did
not
reason
that
her
religion
had
made
her
blind
and
selfish
but
he
felt
her
blindness
and
the
many
cloaks
that
protected
her
and
her
interests
he
held
her
in
respect
and
he
obeyed
her
but
often
and
wistfully
he
had
tried
to
talk
to
his
father
to
make
friends
with
him
to
make
himself
felt
as
a
person
abednego
danner
mind
was
buried
in
the
work
he
had
done
his
son
was
a
foreign
person
for
whom
he
felt
a
perplexed
sympathy
it
is
significant
that
he
had
never
talked
to
hugo
about
hugo
prowess
the
boy
had
not
wished
to
discuss
it
now
however
realizing
its
extent
he
felt
he
must
go
to
his
father
after
dinner
he
said
dad
let
you
and
me
take
a
walk
danner
protective
impulses
functioned
automatically
not
i
wo
have
it
but
mother
danner
guessed
the
reason
for
that
walk
he
said
to
his
wife
with
rare
firmness
if
the
boy
wants
to
walk
with
me
we
going
after
supper
they
went
out
danner
felt
that
she
had
been
shut
out
of
her
own
son
world
and
she
realized
that
he
was
growing
up
danner
and
his
son
strolled
along
the
leafy
street
they
talked
about
his
work
in
school
his
father
seemed
to
hugo
more
human
than
he
had
ever
been
he
even
ventured
the
first
step
toward
other
conversation
well
son
what
is
it
hugo
caught
his
breath
well
i
kind
of
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
you
see
this
afternoon
well
you
know
i
always
been
a
sort
of
strong
kid
danner
trembled
i
know
and
you
have
said
much
about
it
to
me
except
to
be
gentle
that
so
you
must
remember
it
well
i
do
have
to
be
gentle
with
myself
do
i
when
i
alone
like
in
the
woods
that
is
the
older
one
pondered
you
mean
you
like
to
ah
let
yourself
out
when
you
alone
that
what
i
mean
the
usual
constraint
between
them
had
receded
hugo
was
grateful
for
his
father
help
you
see
dad
i
well
i
went
walkin
and
i
i
kind
of
tried
myself
out
danner
answered
in
breathless
eagerness
and
well
i
not
just
a
strong
kid
dad
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
it
seems
i
not
like
other
kids
at
all
i
guess
it
been
gettin
worse
all
these
years
since
i
was
a
baby
worse
i
mean
i
been
gettin
stronger
an
now
it
seems
like
about
well
i
do
like
to
boast
but
it
seems
like
i
about
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
when
i
try
it
it
seems
like
there
is
any
stopping
me
i
can
go
on
far
as
i
like
runnin
jumpin
his
confession
had
commenced
in
detail
hugo
warmed
to
it
i
can
do
things
dad
it
kind
of
scares
me
i
can
jump
a
house
i
can
run
a
train
i
can
pull
up
big
trees
an
push
over
i
see
danner
spine
tingled
he
worshipped
his
son
then
suppose
you
show
me
hugo
looked
up
and
down
the
street
there
was
no
one
in
sight
the
evening
was
still
duskily
lighted
by
afterglow
look
out
then
gon
na
jump
danner
saw
his
son
crouch
but
he
jumped
so
quickly
that
he
vanished
four
seconds
elapsed
he
landed
where
he
had
stood
see
dad
do
it
again
on
the
second
trial
the
professor
eyes
followed
the
soaring
form
and
he
realized
the
magnitude
of
the
thing
he
had
wrought
did
you
see
me
danner
nodded
i
saw
you
son
kind
of
funny
is
it
let
talk
some
more
there
was
a
pause
do
you
realize
son
that
no
one
else
on
earth
can
do
what
you
just
did
yeah
i
guess
not
danner
hesitated
it
a
glorious
thing
and
dangerous
yeah
the
professor
tried
to
simplify
the
biology
of
his
discovery
he
perceived
that
it
was
going
to
involve
him
in
the
mysteries
of
sex
he
knew
that
to
unfold
them
to
a
child
was
considered
immoral
but
danner
was
far
far
beyond
his
epoch
he
put
his
hand
on
hugo
shoulder
and
hugo
set
off
the
process
dad
how
come
i
like
this
i
tell
you
it
a
long
story
and
a
lot
for
a
boy
your
age
to
know
first
what
do
you
know
about
well
about
how
you
were
born
hugo
reddened
i
i
guess
i
know
quite
a
bit
the
kids
in
school
are
always
talkin
about
it
and
i
read
some
we
born
like
well
like
the
kittens
were
born
last
year
that
right
banner
knitted
his
brow
he
began
to
explain
the
details
of
conception
as
it
occurs
in
man
the
biology
of
ova
and
spermatazoa
the
differences
between
the
anatomy
of
the
sexes
and
the
reasons
for
those
differences
he
drew
first
a
botanical
analogy
hugo
listened
intently
i
knew
most
of
that
i
seen
girls
what
some
of
them
after
school
let
you
danner
was
surprised
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
amused
he
had
forgotten
the
details
of
his
young
investigation
they
are
blotted
out
of
the
minds
of
most
adults
to
the
great
advantage
of
dignity
he
did
not
show
his
amusement
or
his
surprise
girls
like
that
he
answered
are
very
nice
they
have
much
modesty
it
rather
indecent
because
sex
is
a
personal
thing
and
something
you
ought
to
keep
for
the
one
you
very
fond
of
understand
that
better
when
you
older
but
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
is
this
when
you
were
little
more
than
a
mass
of
plasm
inside
your
mother
i
put
a
medicine
in
her
blood
that
i
had
discovered
i
did
it
with
a
hypodermic
needle
that
medicine
changed
you
it
altered
the
structure
of
your
bones
and
muscles
and
nerves
and
your
blood
it
made
you
into
a
different
tissue
from
the
weak
fibre
of
ordinary
people
then
when
you
were
born
you
were
strong
did
you
ever
watch
an
ant
carry
many
times
its
weight
or
see
a
grasshopper
jump
fifty
times
its
length
the
insects
have
better
muscles
and
nerves
than
we
have
and
i
improved
your
body
till
it
was
relatively
that
strong
can
you
understand
that
sure
i
like
a
man
made
out
of
iron
instead
of
meat
that
it
hugo
and
as
you
grow
up
you
got
to
remember
that
you
not
an
ordinary
human
being
when
people
find
that
out
they
they
they
hate
me
because
they
fear
you
so
you
see
you
got
to
be
good
and
kind
and
considerate
to
justify
all
that
strength
some
day
you
find
a
use
for
it
a
big
noble
use
and
then
you
can
make
it
work
and
be
proud
of
it
until
that
day
you
have
to
be
humble
like
all
the
rest
of
us
you
must
show
off
or
do
cheap
tricks
then
you
just
be
a
clown
wait
your
time
son
and
you
be
glad
of
it
and
another
thing
train
your
temper
you
must
never
lose
it
you
can
see
what
would
happen
if
you
did
understand
i
guess
i
do
it
hard
work
doin
all
that
the
stronger
the
greater
you
are
the
harder
life
is
for
you
and
you
the
strongest
of
them
all
hugo
the
heart
of
the
boy
burned
and
vibrated
and
what
about
god
he
asked
danner
looked
into
the
darkened
sky
i
do
know
much
about
him
he
sighed
such
was
the
soundest
counsel
that
hugo
was
given
during
his
youth
because
it
came
to
him
accompanied
by
unadulterated
truths
that
he
was
able
to
recognize
it
exerted
a
profound
effect
on
him
it
is
surprising
that
his
father
was
the
one
to
give
it
nevertheless
professor
danner
was
the
only
person
in
all
of
indian
creek
who
had
sufficient
imagination
to
perceive
his
son
problems
and
to
reckon
with
them
in
any
practical
sense
hugo
was
eighteen
before
he
gave
any
other
indication
of
his
strength
save
in
that
fantastic
and
gargantuan
play
which
he
permitted
himself
even
his
play
was
intruded
upon
by
the
and
curious
world
before
he
had
found
the
completeness
of
its
pleasure
then
hugo
fell
into
his
coma
hugo
went
back
to
the
deep
forest
to
think
things
over
and
to
become
acquainted
with
his
powers
at
first
under
full
pressure
of
his
sinews
he
was
clumsy
and
inaccurate
he
learned
deftness
by
trial
and
error
one
day
he
found
a
huge
pit
in
the
tangled
wilderness
it
had
been
an
open
mine
long
years
before
sitting
on
its
brink
staring
into
its
pool
of
verdure
dreaming
he
conceived
a
manner
of
entertainment
suitable
for
his
powers
he
jumped
over
its
craggy
edge
and
walked
to
its
centre
there
he
selected
a
high
place
and
with
his
hands
he
cleared
away
the
growth
that
covered
it
next
he
laid
the
foundations
of
a
fort
over
which
he
was
to
watch
the
fastnesses
for
imaginary
enemies
the
foundations
were
made
of
boulders
some
he
carried
and
some
he
rolled
from
the
floor
of
the
canyon
by
the
end
of
the
afternoon
he
had
laid
out
a
square
wall
of
rock
some
three
feet
in
height
on
the
next
day
he
added
to
it
until
the
four
walls
reached
as
high
as
he
could
stretch
he
left
space
for
one
door
and
he
made
a
single
window
he
roofed
the
walls
with
the
trunks
of
trees
and
he
erected
a
turret
over
the
door
for
days
the
creation
was
his
delight
after
school
he
sped
to
it
until
dark
he
strained
and
struggled
with
bare
rocks
when
it
was
finished
it
was
an
edifice
that
would
have
withstood
artillery
fire
creditably
then
hugo
experimented
with
catapults
but
he
found
no
engine
that
could
hurl
the
rocks
he
used
for
ammunition
as
far
as
his
arms
he
cached
his
treasures
in
his
fortress
an
old
axe
the
scabbard
of
a
sword
tops
and
marbles
two
cans
of
beans
for
emergency
rations
and
he
made
a
flag
of
blue
and
white
cloth
for
himself
then
he
played
in
it
he
pretended
that
indians
were
stalking
him
an
imaginary
head
would
appear
at
the
rim
of
the
pit
hugo
would
see
it
through
a
chink
swish
crash
a
puff
of
dust
would
show
where
rock
met
rock
with
the
attacker
head
between
at
times
he
would
be
stormed
on
all
sides
to
get
the
effect
he
would
leap
the
canyon
and
hurl
boulders
on
his
own
fort
then
he
would
return
and
defend
it
it
was
after
such
a
strenuous
sally
and
while
he
was
waiting
in
high
excitement
for
the
enemy
to
reappear
that
professors
whitaker
and
smith
from
the
college
stumbled
on
his
stronghold
they
were
walking
together
through
the
forest
bent
on
scaling
the
mountain
to
make
certain
observations
of
an
ancient
cirque
that
was
formed
by
the
seventh
great
glacier
as
they
walked
they
debated
matters
of
strata
curvature
suddenly
whitaker
gripped
smith
arm
look
they
stared
through
the
trees
and
over
the
lip
of
hugo
mine
their
eyes
bulged
as
they
observed
the
size
and
weight
of
the
fortress
moonshiners
smith
whispered
rubbish
moonshiners
do
build
like
that
it
a
second
stonehenge
an
indian
relic
but
there
a
sign
of
fresh
work
around
it
whitaker
observed
the
newly
turned
earth
and
the
freshly
bared
rock
perhaps
perhaps
professor
we
fallen
upon
something
big
a
lost
race
of
indian
engineers
a
branch
of
the
incas
or
maybe
they
be
hostile
the
men
edged
forward
and
at
the
moment
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
pit
hugo
emerged
from
his
fort
he
saw
the
men
with
sudden
fear
he
tried
to
hide
hey
they
said
he
did
not
move
but
he
heard
them
scrambling
slowly
toward
the
spot
where
he
lay
dressed
in
civilized
clothes
the
first
professor
said
in
a
loud
voice
as
his
eye
located
hugo
in
the
underbrush
hey
hugo
showed
himself
what
who
are
you
hugo
danner
oh
old
danner
boy
eh
hugo
did
not
like
the
tone
in
which
they
referred
to
his
father
he
made
no
reply
can
you
tell
us
anything
about
these
ruins
what
ruins
they
pointed
to
his
fort
hugo
was
hurt
those
are
ruins
i
built
that
fort
it
to
fight
indians
in
the
pair
ignored
his
answer
and
started
toward
the
fort
hugo
did
not
protest
they
surveyed
its
weighty
walls
and
its
relatively
new
roof
looks
recent
smith
said
this
child
has
evidently
renovated
it
but
it
must
have
stood
here
for
thousands
of
years
it
did
i
made
it
mostly
last
week
they
noticed
him
again
whitaker
simpered
do
lie
young
man
hugo
was
sad
i
not
lying
i
made
it
you
see
i
strong
it
was
as
if
he
had
pronounced
his
own
damnation
tut
tut
smith
interrupted
his
survey
did
you
find
it
i
built
it
i
said
the
professor
spoke
with
increasing
annoyance
i
said
not
to
tell
me
stories
any
longer
it
important
young
man
that
we
know
just
how
you
found
this
dolmen
and
in
what
condition
it
is
a
dolly
whatever
you
said
it
a
fort
and
i
built
it
and
not
lying
the
professor
in
the
interests
of
science
made
a
grave
mistake
he
seized
hugo
by
the
arms
and
shook
him
now
see
here
young
man
have
no
more
of
your
impertinent
lip
tell
me
just
what
you
done
to
harm
this
noble
monument
to
another
race
or
i
swear
i
slap
you
properly
the
professor
had
no
children
he
tried
at
the
same
time
another
tack
which
insulted
hugo
further
if
you
do
i
give
you
a
penny
to
keep
hugo
wrenched
himself
free
with
an
ease
that
startled
smith
his
face
was
dark
almost
black
he
spoke
slowly
as
if
he
was
trying
to
piece
words
into
sense
you
both
of
you
you
go
away
from
here
and
leave
me
or
i
break
your
two
rotten
old
necks
whitaker
moved
toward
him
and
smith
interceded
we
better
leave
him
and
come
back
later
he
was
still
frightened
by
the
strength
in
hugo
arms
the
child
is
mad
he
may
have
hydrophobia
he
might
bite
the
men
moved
away
hastily
hugo
watched
them
climb
the
wall
when
they
reached
the
top
he
called
gently
they
wheeled
and
hugo
sobbing
tears
streaming
from
his
face
leaped
into
his
fort
rocks
vomited
themselves
from
it
huge
rocks
that
no
man
could
budge
walls
toppled
and
crashed
the
men
began
to
move
hugo
looked
up
he
chose
a
stone
that
weighed
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
hey
he
said
i
not
a
liar
the
rock
arched
through
the
air
and
professors
whitaker
and
smith
escaped
death
by
a
scant
margin
hugo
lay
in
the
wreck
of
the
first
thing
his
hands
had
built
and
wept
after
a
little
while
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
chased
the
retreating
professors
when
he
suddenly
appeared
in
front
of
them
they
were
stricken
dumb
do
tell
any
one
about
that
or
about
me
he
said
if
you
do
i
break
down
your
house
just
like
i
broke
mine
do
even
tell
my
family
they
know
it
anyhow
he
leaped
toward
them
over
them
the
forest
hid
him
whitaker
wiped
clammy
perspiration
from
his
brow
what
was
it
smith
a
demon
we
ca
mention
it
he
repeated
thinking
of
the
warning
we
ca
speak
of
it
anyway
they
never
believe
us
v
extremely
dark
of
hair
of
eyes
and
skin
moderately
tall
and
shaped
with
that
compact
symmetry
that
the
male
figure
sometimes
assumes
a
brilliantly
devised
aggressive
head
topping
his
broad
shoulders
graceful
a
man
vehemently
alive
a
man
with
the
promise
of
a
young
god
hugo
at
eighteen
his
emotions
ran
through
his
eyes
like
hot
steel
in
a
dark
mould
people
avoided
those
eyes
they
contained
a
statement
from
which
ordinary
souls
shrank
his
skin
glowed
and
sweated
into
a
shiny
his
voice
was
deep
and
alluring
during
twelve
long
and
fierce
years
he
had
fought
to
know
and
control
himself
indian
creek
had
forgotten
the
terrible
child
hugo
life
at
that
time
revolved
less
about
himself
than
it
had
during
his
first
years
that
was
both
natural
and
fortunate
if
his
classmates
in
school
and
the
older
people
of
the
town
had
not
discounted
his
early
physical
precocity
even
his
splendid
vitality
might
not
have
been
sufficient
to
prevent
him
from
becoming
moody
and
melancholy
but
when
with
the
passage
of
time
he
tossed
no
more
bullies
carried
no
more
barrels
of
temptation
built
no
more
fortresses
and
grew
so
handsome
that
the
matrons
of
indian
creek
as
well
as
the
adolescent
girls
in
high
school
followed
him
with
wayward
glances
when
the
men
found
him
a
gay
and
comprehending
companion
for
any
sport
or
adventure
when
his
teachers
observed
that
his
intelligence
was
often
embarrassingly
acute
when
he
played
on
three
teams
and
was
elected
an
officer
in
his
classes
each
year
then
that
half
of
hugo
which
was
purely
mundane
and
human
dominated
him
and
made
him
happy
his
adolescence
his
emotions
were
no
different
from
those
of
any
young
man
of
his
age
and
character
if
his
ultimate
ambitions
followed
another
trajectory
he
postponed
the
evidence
of
it
hugo
was
in
love
with
anna
blake
the
girl
who
had
attracted
him
when
he
was
six
the
residents
of
indian
creek
knew
it
her
family
received
his
calls
with
the
winking
tolerance
which
the
middle
class
grants
to
young
passion
and
she
was
warm
and
tender
and
flirtatious
and
shy
according
to
the
policies
that
she
had
learned
from
custom
the
active
part
of
hugo
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
marry
her
after
he
had
graduated
from
the
college
in
indian
creek
that
they
would
settle
somewhere
near
by
and
that
they
would
raise
a
number
of
children
his
subconscious
thoughts
made
reservations
that
he
in
moments
when
he
was
intimate
with
himself
would
admit
frankly
it
made
him
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
to
see
that
on
one
night
he
would
sit
with
anna
and
kiss
her
ardently
until
his
body
ached
and
on
another
he
would
deliberately
plan
to
desert
her
his
idealism
at
that
time
was
very
great
and
untried
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
all
men
are
so
deliberately
calculating
in
the
love
they
disguise
as
absolute
anna
had
grown
into
a
very
attractive
woman
her
figure
was
rounded
and
tall
her
hair
was
darker
than
the
waxy
curls
of
her
childhood
and
a
vital
gleam
had
come
into
it
her
eyes
were
still
as
blue
and
her
voice
shorn
of
its
faltering
youngness
was
sweet
and
clear
she
was
undoubtedly
the
prettiest
girl
in
high
school
and
the
logical
for
hugo
danner
a
flower
ready
to
be
plucked
at
eighteen
when
hugo
reached
his
senior
year
that
readiness
became
almost
an
impatience
girls
married
at
an
early
age
in
indian
creek
she
looked
down
the
corridor
of
time
during
which
he
would
be
in
college
she
felt
the
pressure
of
his
still
slumbering
passion
and
she
sensed
his
superiority
over
most
of
the
town
boys
only
a
very
narrow
critic
would
call
her
resultant
tactics
dishonourable
they
were
too
intensely
human
and
too
clearly
born
of
social
and
biological
necessity
she
had
let
him
kiss
her
when
they
were
sixteen
and
afterwards
before
she
went
to
sleep
she
sighed
rapturously
at
the
memory
of
his
warm
firm
lips
his
strong
rough
arms
hugo
had
gone
home
through
the
dizzily
spinning
dusk
through
the
trees
and
the
fragrant
fields
his
breath
deep
in
his
chest
his
eyes
hot
and
somewhat
understanding
gradually
anna
increased
that
license
she
knew
and
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
she
played
a
long
game
in
which
she
said
if
our
love
is
consummated
too
soon
the
social
loss
will
be
balanced
by
a
speedier
marriage
because
hugo
is
honourable
but
that
will
never
happen
two
years
after
that
first
kiss
when
they
were
floating
on
the
narrow
river
in
a
canoe
hugo
unfastened
her
blouse
and
exposed
the
creamy
beauty
of
her
bosom
to
the
soft
moonlight
and
she
did
not
protest
that
night
he
nearly
possessed
her
and
after
that
night
he
learned
through
her
unspoken
voluptuous
suggestion
all
the
technique
of
this
side
of
consummation
when
finally
he
called
one
night
at
her
house
and
found
that
she
was
alone
and
that
her
parents
and
her
brother
would
not
return
until
the
next
day
they
looked
at
each
other
with
a
shining
agreement
he
turned
the
lights
out
and
they
sat
on
the
couch
in
the
darkness
listening
to
the
passing
of
people
on
the
sidewalk
outside
he
undressed
her
he
whispered
halting
passionate
phrases
he
asked
her
if
she
was
afraid
and
let
himself
be
laughed
away
from
his
own
conscience
then
he
took
her
and
loved
her
afterwards
going
home
again
in
the
gloom
of
late
night
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
they
stood
still
he
realized
that
a
certain
path
of
life
had
been
followed
to
its
conclusion
he
felt
initiated
into
the
adult
world
and
it
had
been
so
simple
so
natural
so
sweet
he
threw
a
great
stone
into
the
river
and
laughed
and
walked
on
after
a
while
through
the
summer
that
followed
hugo
and
anna
ran
the
course
of
their
affair
they
loved
each
other
violently
and
incessantly
and
with
no
other
evil
consequence
than
to
invite
the
open
humphs
of
village
gossips
and
to
involve
him
in
several
serious
talks
with
her
father
their
courtship
was
given
the
benefit
of
conventional
doubt
however
and
their
innocence
was
hotly
if
covertly
protested
by
the
blakes
danner
coldly
ignored
every
fragment
of
insinuation
she
hoped
that
hugo
and
anna
would
announce
their
engagement
and
she
hinted
that
hope
hugo
himself
was
excited
and
absorbed
occasionally
he
thought
he
was
sterile
with
an
inclination
to
be
pleased
rather
than
concerned
if
it
was
true
he
added
tenderness
to
his
characteristics
and
he
loved
anna
too
much
toward
the
end
of
that
summer
she
lost
weight
and
became
irritable
they
quarrelled
once
and
then
again
the
criteria
for
his
physical
conduct
being
vague
in
his
mind
hugo
could
not
gauge
it
correctly
and
he
did
not
realize
that
the
very
ardour
of
his
relation
with
her
was
abnormal
her
family
decided
to
send
her
away
believing
the
opposite
of
the
truth
responsible
for
her
nervousness
and
weakness
a
week
before
she
left
hugo
himself
tired
of
his
excesses
one
evening
dressing
for
a
last
passionate
rendezvous
he
looked
in
his
mirror
as
he
tied
his
scarf
and
saw
that
he
was
frowning
studying
the
frown
he
perceived
with
a
shock
what
made
it
he
did
not
want
to
see
anna
to
take
her
out
to
kiss
and
rumple
and
clasp
her
to
return
thinking
of
her
feeling
her
sweet
and
smelling
like
her
it
annoyed
him
it
bored
him
he
went
through
it
uneasily
and
quarrelled
again
two
days
later
she
departed
he
acted
his
loss
well
and
she
did
not
show
her
relief
until
she
sat
on
the
train
tired
shattered
and
uninterested
in
hugo
and
in
life
then
she
cried
but
hugo
was
through
they
exchanged
insincere
letters
he
looked
forward
to
college
in
the
fall
then
he
received
a
letter
from
anna
saying
that
she
was
going
to
marry
a
man
she
had
met
and
known
for
three
weeks
it
was
a
broken
gasping
apologetic
letter
every
one
was
outraged
at
anna
and
astounded
that
hugo
bore
the
shock
so
courageously
the
upshot
of
that
summer
was
to
fill
his
mind
with
fetid
memories
which
abated
slowly
to
make
him
disgusted
with
himself
and
tired
of
indian
creek
he
decided
to
go
to
a
different
college
one
far
away
from
the
scene
of
his
painful
youth
and
his
disillusioned
maturity
he
chose
webster
university
because
of
the
greatness
of
its
name
if
abednego
danner
was
hurt
at
his
son
defection
from
his
own
college
he
said
nothing
and
danner
grown
more
silent
and
reserved
yielded
to
her
son
unexpected
decision
hugo
packed
his
bags
one
september
afternoon
with
a
feeling
of
dreaminess
he
bade
farewell
to
his
family
he
boarded
the
train
his
mind
was
opaque
the
spark
burning
in
it
was
one
of
dawning
adventure
buried
in
a
mass
of
detail
he
had
never
been
far
from
his
native
soil
now
he
was
going
to
see
cities
and
people
who
were
almost
foreign
in
the
sophisticated
east
but
all
he
could
dwell
on
was
a
swift
cinema
of
a
defeated
little
boy
a
strong
man
who
could
never
be
strong
a
surfeited
love
a
truant
and
dimly
comprehensible
blonde
girl
a
muddy
street
and
a
red
station
a
clapboard
house
a
sonorous
church
with
hushed
puppets
in
the
pews
fudge
parties
boats
on
the
little
river
cold
winter
and
ice
over
the
mountains
and
a
fortress
where
once
upon
a
time
he
had
felt
mightier
than
the
universe
vi
the
short
branch
line
to
which
hugo
changed
brought
him
to
the
fringe
of
the
campus
the
cars
were
full
of
boys
so
many
of
them
that
he
was
embarrassed
they
all
appeared
to
know
each
other
and
no
one
spoke
to
him
his
dreams
on
the
train
were
culminated
he
had
decided
to
become
a
great
athlete
with
his
mind
eye
he
played
the
football
he
would
play
and
the
baseball
runs
homers
hit
over
the
fence
into
oblivion
seeing
the
boys
and
feeling
their
lack
of
notice
of
him
redoubled
the
force
of
that
decision
then
he
stepped
on
to
the
station
platform
and
stood
facing
the
campus
he
could
not
escape
a
rush
of
reverence
and
of
awe
it
was
so
wide
so
green
and
beautiful
far
away
towered
the
giant
arches
of
the
stadium
near
by
were
the
sharp
gothic
points
of
the
chapel
and
the
graduate
college
between
them
a
score
or
more
of
buildings
rambled
in
and
out
through
the
trees
hey
hugo
turned
a
little
a
youth
in
a
white
shirt
and
white
trousers
was
beckoning
to
him
freshman
are
you
yes
my
name
danner
hugo
danner
i
lefty
foresman
chuck
a
second
student
separated
himself
from
the
bustle
of
baggage
and
young
men
here
a
freshman
hugo
waited
with
some
embarrassment
he
wondered
why
they
wanted
a
freshman
lefty
introduced
chuck
and
then
said
are
you
strong
freshman
for
an
instant
he
was
stunned
had
they
heard
guessed
then
he
realized
it
was
impossible
they
wanted
him
to
work
they
were
going
to
haze
him
sure
he
said
then
get
this
trunk
and
i
show
you
where
to
take
it
hugo
was
handed
a
baggage
check
he
found
the
official
and
located
the
trunk
tentatively
he
tested
its
weight
as
if
he
were
a
normally
husky
youth
about
to
undertake
its
transportation
he
felt
pleased
that
his
strength
was
going
to
be
tried
so
accidentally
and
in
such
short
order
lefty
and
chuck
heaved
the
trunk
on
his
back
can
you
carry
it
they
asked
sure
do
be
too
sure
it
a
long
way
peering
from
beneath
the
trunk
under
which
he
bent
with
a
fair
assumption
of
human
weakness
hugo
had
his
first
close
glimpse
of
webster
they
passed
under
a
huge
arch
and
down
a
street
lined
with
elms
students
were
everywhere
carrying
books
and
furniture
moving
in
wheelbarrows
and
moving
by
means
of
the
backs
of
other
freshmen
the
two
who
led
him
were
talking
and
he
listened
as
he
plodded
saw
marcia
just
before
i
left
the
lake
took
her
out
one
night
and
got
all

was
a
pause
you

an
indian
are
you
it
was
asked
bluntly
scotch
presbyterian
for
twenty
generations
well
when
you
get
through
here
you
be
full
of
scotch
and
emptied
of
the
presbyterianism
put
the
trunk
down
their
talk
of
women
of
classes
of
football
excited
hugo
he
was
not
quite
as
amazed
to
find
that
lefty
foresman
was
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
football
team
as
he
might
have
been
later
when
he
knew
how
many
students
attended
the
university
and
how
few
relatively
were
athletes
he
decided
at
once
that
he
liked
lefty
the
sophistication
of
his
talk
was
unfamiliar
to
hugo
much
of
it
he
could
not
understand
and
only
guessed
he
wanted
lefty
to
notice
him
when
he
was
told
to
put
the
trunk
down
he
did
not
obey
instead
with
precision
and
ease
he
swung
it
up
on
his
shoulder
held
it
with
one
hand
and
said
in
an
unflustered
tone
i
not
tired
honestly
where
do
we
go
from
here
great
howling
jesus
lefty
said
what
have
we
here
hey
put
that
trunk
down
there
was
excitement
in
his
voice
say
guy
do
that
again
hugo
did
it
lefty
squeezed
his
biceps
and
grew
pale
those
muscles
in
action
lost
their
feel
of
flesh
and
became
like
stone
lefty
said
say
boy
can
you
play
football
sure
hugo
said
well
you
leave
that
trunk
with
chuck
here
and
come
with
me
hugo
did
as
he
had
been
ordered
and
they
walked
side
by
side
to
the
gymnasium
hugo
had
once
seen
a
small
gymnasium
ill
equipped
and
badly
lighted
and
it
had
appealed
mightily
to
him
now
he
stood
in
a
prodigious
vaulted
room
with
a
shimmering
floor
a
circular
balcony
a
varied
array
of
apparatus
his
hands
clenched
lefty
quit
him
for
a
moment
and
came
back
with
a
man
who
wore
knickers
woodman
this
is
what
the
hell
your
name
danner
hugo
danner
woodman
is
football
coach
hugo
took
the
man
hand
lefty
excused
himself
woodman
said
young
foresman
said
you
played
football
just
on
a
team
in
colorado
said
you
were
husky
go
in
my
office
and
ask
fitzsimmons
to
give
you
a
gym
suit
come
out
when
you
ready
hugo
undressed
and
put
on
the
suit
fitzsimmons
the
trainer
looked
at
him
with
warm
admiration
you
sure
built
son
yeah
that
luck
is
it
then
hugo
was
taken
to
another
office
woodman
asked
him
a
number
of
questions
about
his
weight
his
health
his
past
medical
history
he
listened
to
hugo
heart
and
then
led
him
to
a
scale
hugo
had
lied
about
his
weight
i
thought
you
said
one
hundred
and
sixty
mr
danner
the
scales
showed
two
hundred
and
eleven
but
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
of
his
size
and
build
to
weigh
that
much
hugo
had
lied
deliberately
hoping
that
he
could
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
being
weighed
i
did
woodman
you
see
my
weight
is
a
sort
of
freak
i
do
show
it
no
one
would
believe
it
and
yet
there
it
is
he
did
not
go
into
the
details
of
his
construction
from
a
plasm
new
to
biology
huh
woodman
said
together
they
walked
out
on
the
floor
of
the
gymnasium
woodman
called
to
one
of
the
figures
on
the
track
who
was
making
slow
plodding
circuits
hey
nellie
take
this
bird
up
and
pace
him
for
a
lap
make
it
fast
a
little
smile
came
at
the
corners
of
hugo
mouth
several
of
the
men
in
the
gymnasium
stopped
work
to
watch
the
trial
of
what
was
evidently
a
new
candidate
ready
woodman
said
and
the
runners
crouched
side
by
side
set
go
nelson
one
of
the
best
sprinters
webster
had
had
for
years
dashed
forward
he
had
covered
thirty
feet
when
he
heard
a
voice
almost
in
his
ear
faster
old
man
nelson
increased
faster
boy
i
passing
you
the
words
were
spoken
quietly
calmly
a
rage
filled
nelson
he
let
every
ounce
of
his
strength
into
his
limbs
and
skimmed
the
canvas
half
a
lap
hugo
ran
at
his
side
and
nelson
could
not
lead
him
the
remaining
half
was
not
a
race
hugo
finished
thirty
feet
in
the
lead
woodman
standing
on
the
floor
wiped
his
forehead
and
bawled
that
the
best
you
can
do
nellie
yes
sir
what
in
hell
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
nelson
drew
a
sobbing
breath
i
have
done
a
thing
time
that
man
he
faster
than
the
intercollegiate
mark
woodman
still
dubious
made
hugo
run
against
time
and
hugo
eager
to
make
an
impression
and
unguided
by
a
human
runner
broke
the
record
for
the
distance
around
the
track
by
a
second
and
the
watch
in
woodman
hands
trembled
hey
he
said
uncertain
of
his
voice
come
down
here
will
you
hugo
descended
the
spiral
iron
staircase
he
was
breathing
with
ease
woodman
stared
at
him
lessee
you
jump
hugo
was
familiar
with
the
distances
for
jumping
made
in
track
meets
he
was
careful
not
to
overdo
his
effort
his
running
jump
was
feet
and
his
standing
jump
was
eleven
feet
and
some
inches
face
ran
water
his
eyes
gleamed
danner
he
said
where
did
you
get
that
way
what
way
i
mean
what
have
you
done
all
your
life
nothing
gone
to
school
two
hundred
and
eleven
pounds
woodman
muttered
run
like
an
olympic
champ
jump
like
a
kangaroo
how
your
kicking
all
right
i
guess
passing
all
right
i
guess
come
on
outside
hey
fitz
bring
a
ball
an
hour
later
fitzsimmons
found
woodman
sitting
in
his
office
beside
him
was
a
bottle
of
whisky
which
he
kept
to
revive
wounded
gladiators
fitz
said
woodman
looking
at
the
trainer
with
dazed
eyes
did
you
see
what
i
saw

fitzsimmons
scratched
his
greying
head

young
man

fitz
i
saw
a
young
man
come
into
the
gym

undress
he
looked
like
an
oiled
steam
engine
i
saw
him
go
and
knock
hell
out
of
three
track
records
without
even
losing
his
breath
then
i
seen
him
go
out
on
the
field
an
kick
a
football
from
one
end
to
the
other
an
pass

man

all
the
other

he
telephoned
to
the
registrar

said
the
voice
of
a
secretary
passed
his
examinations
with
the
highest
honours
and
was
admitted
among
the
first
ten
he
passed
his
entrance
exams
among
the
first
ten
fitzsimmons
repeated
god
said
woodman
it
the
millennium
and
he
took
a
drink
late
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
hugo
found
his
room
in
thompson
dormitory
he
unpacked
his
and
his
straw
suitcase
he
checked
in
his
mind
the
things
that
he
had
done
it
seemed
a
great
deal
for
one
day
a
complete
alteration
of
his
life
he
had
seen
the
dean
and
arranged
his
classes
trigonometry
english
french
latin
biology
physics
economics
hygiene
with
a
pencil
and
a
ruler
he
made
a
schedule
which
he
pinned
on
the
desk
he
had
bought
then
he
checked
his
furniture
a
desk
two
chairs
a
bed
a
rug
sheets
and
blankets
towels
he
hung
his
clothes
in
the
closet
for
a
while
he
looked
at
them
attentively
they
were
not
like
the
clothes
of
the
other
students
he
could
not
quite
perceive
the
difference
but
he
felt
it
and
it
made
him
uncomfortable
the
room
to
which
he
had
been
assigned
was
pleasant
it
looked
over
the
rolling
campus
on
two
sides
and
both
windows
were
framed
in
the
leaves
of
nodding
ivy
it
was
growing
dark
from
a
dormitory
near
by
came
the
music
of
a
banjo
presently
the
player
sang
and
other
voices
joined
with
him
a
warm
and
golden
sun
touched
the
high
clouds
with
lingering
fire
voices
cried
out
young
and
vigorous
hugo
sighed
he
was
going
to
be
happy
at
webster
his
greatness
was
going
to
be
born
here
at
that
time
woodman
called
informally
on
chuck
and
lefty
they
were
in
a
heated
argument
over
the
decorative
arrangement
of
various
liquor
bottles
when
he
knocked
come
in
they
shouted
in
unison
hello
oh
woodie
come
in
sit
down
want
a
drink
you
not
in
training
no
thanks
had
one
and
it
would
be
a
damn
sight
better
if
you
birds
did
keep
the
stuff
around
it
chuck
lefty
grinned
all
right
i
came
to
see
about
that
bird
you
brought
to
me
danner
was
he
any
good
woodman
hesitated
fellows

thirty
feet
in
a
lap
on
the
track
great
god
he
jumped
and
eleven
feet
running
and
standing
he
kicked
half
a
dozen
punts
for
eighty
and
ninety
yards
and
he
passed
the
same
distance
lefty
sat
down
on
the
window
seat
his
voice
was
hoarse
that
ca
be
done
woodie
i
know
it
but
he
did
it
but
that
is
what
makes
me
frightened
how
much
do
you
think
he
weighs
one
or
thereabouts
woodie
shook
his
head
no
lefty
he
weighs
two
hundred
and
eleven
two
eleven
he
ca
woodie
there
something
wrong
with
your
scales
not
a
thing
the
two
students
stared
at
each
other
and
then
at
the
coach
they
were
able
to
grasp
the
facts
intellectually
but
they
could
not
penetrate
the
reactions
of
their
emotions
at
last
lefty
said
but
that
is
well
it
is
human
woodie
that
why
i
scared
something
has
happened
to
this
bird
he
has
a
disease
of
some
kind
that
has
toughened
him
like
pott
disease
that
turns
you
to
stone
but
you
would
think
it
there
not
a
trace
of
anything
on
the
surface
i
having
a
blood
test
made
soon
wait
till
when
you
see
him
in
action
it
terrify
you
because
have
the
same
damned
weird
feeling
i
have
that
he
is
doing
one
tenth
of
what
he
can
do
that
he
really
just
playing
with
us
all
by
god
if
i
was
a
bit
superstitious
i
throw
up
my
job
and
get
as
much
distance
between
me
and
that
bird
as
i
could
i
telling
you
simply
to
prepare
you
there
something
mighty
funny
about
him
and
the
sooner
we
find
out
the
better
woodman
left
the
dormitory
lefty
and
chuck
stared
at
each
other
for
the
space
of
a
minute
and
then
with
one
accord
they
went
together
to
the
registrar
office
there
they
found
hugo
address
on
the
campus
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
his
door
come
in
hugo
said
he
smiled
when
he
saw
lefty
and
chuck
want
some
more
trunks
moved
maybe
later
they
sat
down
eying
hugo
speculatively
lefty
acted
as
spokesman
listen
here
guy
we
just
seen
woodie
and
he
says
phenomenal
so
much
so
that
it
is
right
hugo
reddened
he
had
feared
that
his
exhibition
was
exaggerated
by
his
eagerness
to
impress
the
coach
he
said
nothing
and
lefty
continued
you
going
to
be
here
for
four
years
and
you
going
to
love
this
place
you
going
to
be
willing
to
die
for
it
all
the
rest
of
your
life
the
fact
that
you
went
to
old
webster
is
going
to
make
a
difference
but
there
one
thing
that
webster
insists
on
and
fair
play
and
honesty
and
courage
you
come
from
a
little
town
in
the
west
and
you
a
stranger
here
understand
this
is
all
in
a
spirit
of
friendship
so
far
we
like
you
we
want
you
to
be
one
of
us
to
belong
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
and
a
long
way
to
go
i
being
frank
because
i
want
to
like
you
for
instance
chuck
here
is
a
millionaire
my
old
man
is
no
dead
stick
in
the
blue
book
things
like
that
will
be
different
from
what
you
known
before
but
the
important
thing
is
to
be
a
square
shooter
do
be
angry
do
you
understand
hugo
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
thickened
gloom
he
had
caught
the
worry
the
repression
in
lefty
voice
the
youth
his
merry
blue
eyes
suddenly
grave
his
poised
self
abnormally
disturbed
had
suggested
a
criticism
of
some
sort
what
was
it
hugo
was
hurt
and
a
little
frightened
would
his
college
life
be
a
repetition
of
indian
creek
would
the
athletes
and
the
others
in
college
of
his
own
age
fear
and
detest
him
because
he
was
superior
was
that
what
they
meant
he
did
not
know
he
was
loath
to
offend
lefty
and
chuck
but
there
seemed
no
alternative
to
the
risk
no
one
had
talked
to
him
in
that
way
for
a
long
time
he
sat
on
his
bed
fellows
he
said
tersely
i
do
think
i
know
what
you
driving
at
will
you
tell
me
the
roommates
fidgeted
they
did
not
know
exactly
either
they
had
come
to
fathom
the
abnormality
in
hugo
chuck
lit
a
cigarette
lefty
smiled
with
an
assumed
ease
why
nothing
danner
you
see
well
quarterback
of
the
football
team
and
you
probably
be
on
it
this
year
we
have
adopted
the
new
idea
of
keeping
freshmen
off
the
varsity
just
wanted
to
tell
you
those
well
those
principles
hugo
knew
he
had
not
been
answered
he
felt
too
that
he
would
never
in
his
life
give
away
his
secret
the
defences
surrounding
it
had
been
too
immutably
fixed
his
joy
at
knowing
that
he
had
been
accepted
so
soon
as
a
logical
candidate
for
the
football
team
was
tempered
by
this
questioning
i
have
principles
fellows
good
lefty
rose
guess
we
be
going
by
the
way
woodie
said
you
smashed
a
couple
of
track
records
where
you
learn
nowhere
how
come
then
just
natural
lefty
summoned
his
will
sure
it
is
well
unhealthy
woodie
says
there
are
a
couple
of
diseases
that
make
you
well
get
tough
like
stone
hugo
realized
the
purpose
of
the
visit
then
be
sure
i
have
any
diseases
my
father
had
an
he
smiled
awkwardly
ever
since
i
was
a
kid
i
been
stronger
than
most
people
and
i
probably
have
a
little
edge
still
just
an
accident
that
all
is
that
what
you
were
wondering
about
lefty
smiled
with
instant
relief
yes
it
is
and
i
glad
you
take
it
that
way
listen
why
do
you
come
over
to
the
inn
and
take
dinner
with
chuck
and
me
let
commons
go
for
what
say
at
eleven
hugo
wound
his
alarm
clock
and
set
it
for
seven
he
yawned
and
smiled
all
during
supper
he
had
listened
to
the
glories
of
webster
and
the
advantages
of
belonging
to
the
psi
delta
fraternity
to
descriptions
of
parties
and
to
episodes
with
girls
lefty
and
chuck
had
embraced
him
in
their
circle
they
had
made
suggestions
about
what
he
should
wear
and
whom
he
should
know
they
had
posted
him
on
the
behaviour
best
suited
for
each
of
his
professors
they
liked
him
and
he
liked
them
immensely
they
were
the
finest
fellows
in
the
world
webster
was
a
magnificent
university
and
he
was
going
to
be
one
of
its
most
glorious
sons
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
in
a
moment
he
slept
drawing
in
deep
swift
breaths
his
face
was
smiling
and
his
arm
was
extended
whether
to
ward
off
shadows
or
to
embrace
a
new
treasure
could
not
be
told
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
morning
his
alarm
jangled
and
he
woke
to
begin
his
career
as
an
undergraduate
vii
from
the
day
of
his
arrival
webster
university
felt
the
presence
of
hugo
danner
classes
football
practice
hazing
fraternity
scouting
began
on
that
morning
with
a
feverish
and
that
for
a
time
completely
bewildered
him
hugo
participated
in
everything
he
went
to
the
classroom
with
pleasure
it
was
never
difficult
for
him
to
learn
and
never
easier
than
in
those
first
few
weeks
the
professors
he
had
known
and
he
reluctantly
included
his
own
father
were
individuals
who
had
none
of
the
humanities
and
at
least
some
of
the
professors
at
webster
were
brilliant
urbane
capable
of
all
understanding
their
lectures
were
like
tonic
to
hugo
the
number
of
his
friends
grew
with
amazing
rapidity
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
cross
the
campus
without
being
hailed
by
a
member
of
the
football
team
and
presented
to
another
student
the
psi
deltas
saw
to
it
that
he
met
the
entire
personnel
of
their
chapter
at
webster
other
fraternities
looked
at
him
with
covetous
eyes
but
lefty
foresman
who
was
chairman
of
the
membership
committee
let
it
be
known
that
the
psi
deltas
had
marked
hugo
for
their
own
and
no
one
refused
their
bid
on
the
second
monday
after
college
opened
hugo
went
to
the
class
elections
and
found
to
his
astonishment
that
he
received
votes
for
president
a
boy
from
a
large
preparatory
school
was
elected
but
votes
spoke
well
for
the
reputation
he
had
gained
in
that
short
time
on
that
day
too
he
learned
the
class
customs
freshmen
had
to
wear
black
caps
black
shoes
and
socks
and
ties
they
were
not
allowed
to
walk
on
the
grass
or
to
ride
bicycles
the
ancient
cannon
in
the
center
of
the
class
square
was
defended
annually
by
the
sophomores
and
its
theft
was
always
attempted
by
the
freshmen
no
entering
class
had
stolen
it
in
eight
years
those
things
amused
hugo
they
gave
him
an
intimate
feeling
of
belonging
to
his
school
he
wrote
to
his
parents
about
them
dean
aiken
the
newly
elected
president
of
the
freshman
class
approached
hugo
on
the
matter
of
the
cannon
we
want
a
gang
of
good
husky
boys
to
pull
it
up
some
night
and
take
it
away
are
you
with
us
sure
left
to
his
own
considerations
hugo
recalled
his
promise
and
walked
across
the
campus
with
the
object
of
studying
the
cannon
it
was
a
piece
of
revolutionary
war
vintage
it
stood
directly
in
the
rear
of
webster
hall
and
while
hugo
regarded
it
he
noticed
that
two
sophomores
remained
in
the
vicinity
he
knew
that
guard
changed
every
two
hours
would
be
on
duty
day
and
night
until
christmas
was
safely
passed
well
the
cannon
was
secure
it
could
be
rolled
away
the
theft
of
it
would
require
first
a
with
the
sophomores
and
after
a
definite
victory
a
mob
assault
of
the
gun
hugo
walked
closer
to
it
off
the
grass
freshman
he
wheeled
obediently
one
of
the
guards
approached
him
get
off
the
grass
and
stay
off
and
do
look
at
that
cannon
with
longing
it
healthy
for
young
freshmen
hugo
grinned
all
right
fella
but
you
better
keep
a
double
guard
on
that
thing
while
i
want
it
two
nights
later
during
a
heavy
rain
that
had
begun
after
the
fall
of
dark
hugo
clad
himself
in
a
slicker
and
moved
vaguely
into
the
night
presently
he
reached
the
cannon
yard
and
in
the
shelter
of
an
arch
he
saw
the
sophomore
guards
they
smoked
cigarettes
and
one
of
them
sang
softly
day
and
night
a
pair
of
conscripted
sentries
kept
watchful
eyes
on
the
gun
a
shout
from
either
of
them
would
bring
the
whole
class
tumbling
from
its
slumber
in
a
very
few
moments
hugo
moved
out
of
their
vision
the
campus
was
empty
he
rounded
webster
hall
the
mud
sucking
softly
under
his
feet
and
the
rain
dampening
his
face
from
beneath
his
coat
he
took
a
flare
and
lighted
the
fuse
he
heard
the
two
sophomores
running
toward
it
in
the
thick
murk
when
they
were
very
close
he
stepped
on
to
the
stone
flagging
looked
up
into
the
cloudy
sky
gathered
himself
and
leaped
over
the
three
stories
of
webster
hall
he
landed
with
a
loud
thud
ten
feet
from
the
cannon
when
the
sophomores
returned
after
extinguishing
the
flare
their
cherished
symbol
of
authority
had
vanished
there
was
din
on
the
campus
first
the
loud
cries
of
two
voices
then
the
screech
of
raised
windows
the
babble
of
more
voices
and
the
rush
of
feet
that
came
with
new
gusts
of
rain
pierced
the
gloom
where
the
cannon
had
been
a
hundred
and
then
two
hundred
figures
gathered
swirled
organized
built
a
fire
dawn
came
and
the
cannon
was
still
missing
the
clouds
lifted
in
the
wan
light
some
one
pointed
up
there
on
the
roof
of
webster
hall
with
the
numerals
of
the
freshman
class
painted
on
its
muzzle
was
the
old
weapon
arms
stretched
an
angry
incredulous
hum
waxed
to
a
steady
pitch
and
waned
as
the
sophomores
dispersed
in
the
morning
theory
ran
rife
the
freshmen
were
pretending
knowledge
where
they
had
none
exulting
secretly
dean
aiken
was
kidnapped
at
noon
and
given
a
third
degree
which
extorted
no
information
the
theft
of
the
cannon
and
its
elevation
to
the
roof
of
the
hall
entered
the
annals
of
webster
legend
and
hugo
watching
the
laborious
task
of
its
removal
from
the
roof
seemed
merely
as
pleased
and
as
mystified
as
the
other
freshmen
so
the
autumn
commenced
the
first
football
game
was
played
and
hugo
made
a
touchdown
he
made
another
in
the
second
game
they
took
him
to
new
york
in
november
for
the
dinner
that
was
to
celebrate
the
entrance
of
a
new
chapter
to
psi
delta
his
fraternity
had
hired
a
private
car
as
soon
as
the
college
towers
vanished
the
entertainment
committee
took
over
the
party
glasses
were
filled
with
whisky
and
passed
by
a
negro
porter
hugo
took
his
with
a
feeling
of
nervousness
and
of
excited
anticipation
the
coach
had
given
him
permission
to
break
training
advised
it
in
fact
and
hugo
had
never
tasted
liquor
he
watched
the
others
holding
his
glass
gingerly
they
swallowed
their
drinks
took
more
the
effect
did
not
seem
to
be
great
he
smelled
the
whisky
and
the
smell
revolted
him
drink
up
danner
never
use
the
stuff
i
afraid
it
throw
me
not
you
come
on
bottoms
up
it
ran
into
his
throat
hot
and
steaming
he
swallowed
a
thousand
needles
and
knew
the
warmth
of
it
in
his
stomach
they
gave
another
glass
to
him
and
then
a
third
some
of
the
brothers
were
playing
cards
hugo
watched
them
he
perceived
that
his
feet
were
loose
on
their
ankles
and
that
his
shoulders
lurched
it
would
not
do
to
lose
control
of
himself
he
thought
for
another
man
it
might
be
safe
not
for
him
he
repeated
the
thought
inanely
some
one
took
his
arm
nice
work
in
the
game
last
week
pretty
thanks
woodie
says
you
the
best
man
on
the
team
glad
you
went
psi
delt
best
house
on
the
campus
great
school
webster
you
love
it
sure
hugo
said
the
railroad
coach
was
twisting
and
writhing
peculiarly
hugo
suddenly
wanted
to
be
in
the
air
he
hastened
to
the
platform
of
the
car
and
stood
on
it
squinting
his
eyes
at
the
countryside
when
they
reached
the
grand
central
terminal
he
was
cured
of
his
faintness
they
rode
to
the
theatre
in
an
omnibus
and
saw
the
matinée
of
a
musical
show
hugo
had
never
realized
that
so
many
pretty
girls
could
be
gathered
together
in
one
place
their
scant
glittering
costumes
flashed
in
his
face
he
wanted
them
between
the
acts
the
fraternity
repaired
in
a
body
to
the
lavatory
and
drank
whisky
from
bottles
hugo
began
to
feel
that
he
was
living
at
last
he
was
among
men
sophisticated
men
and
learning
to
be
like
them
nothing
like
the
the
show
the
liquor
in
indian
creek
he
was
wearing
the
suit
that
lefty
foresman
had
chosen
for
him
he
felt
well
dressed
cool
capable
he
was
intensely
well
disposed
toward
his
companions
when
the
show
was
over
he
stood
in
the
bright
lights
momentarily
depressed
by
the
disappearance
of
the
long
file
of
girls
then
he
shouldered
among
his
companions
and
went
out
of
the
theatre
riotously
two
long
tables
were
drawn
up
at
the
raven
a
restaurant
famous
for
its
roast
meats
its
beer
and
its
lack
of
scruples
about
the
behaviour
of
its
guests
the
psi
deltas
took
their
places
at
the
tables
the
they
occupied
was
private
hugo
saw
as
if
in
a
dream
the
long
rows
of
silverware
the
dishes
of
celery
and
olives
and
the
ranks
of
shining
glasses
they
sat
waiters
wound
their
way
among
them
there
was
a
song
the
toastmaster
a
new
york
executive
who
had
graduated
from
webster
twenty
years
before
understood
the
temper
of
his
charge
he
was
witty
ribald
genial
he
made
a
speech
but
not
too
long
a
speech
he
called
on
the
president
of
a
bank
who
rose
totteringly
and
undid
the
toastmaster
good
offices
by
making
too
long
a
speech
its
reiterated
dear
old
websters
were
finally
lost
in
the
ring
and
tinkle
of
glassware
and
cutlery
at
the
end
of
the
long
meal
hugo
realized
that
his
being
had
undergone
change
objects
approached
and
receded
before
his
vision
the
voice
of
the
man
sitting
beside
him
came
to
his
ears
as
if
through
water
his
mind
continually
turned
upon
itself
in
a
sort
of
infatuated
examination
his
attention
could
not
be
held
even
on
his
own
words
he
decided
that
he
was
feverish
then
some
one
said
well
danner
how
do
you
like
being
drunk
drunk
sure
you
are
going
to
tell
me
you
sober
are
you
when
the
speaker
had
gone
hugo
realized
that
it
was
chuck
there
had
been
no
feeling
of
recognition
i
drunk
he
said
some
one
give
danner
a
drink
he
has
illusions
drunk
why
this
man
is
drunk
it
monstrous
he
has
a
weakened
spine
that
all
i
drunk
hugo
repeated
he
knew
then
what
it
was
to
be
drunk
the
toastmaster
was
rising
again
hugo
saw
it
dimly
fellows
a
fork
banged
on
a
glass
fellows
there
was
a
slow
increase
in
silence

thrown
out
straight
off
without
an
argument
are

on
the
announcement
was
greeted
by
a
stunned
quiet
which
grew
into
a
bellow
of
approval
plates
and
glasses
were
thrown
on
the
floor
lefty
leaped
on
to
the
table
and
performed
a
dance
the
proprietor
came
in
looked
and
left
hastily
and
then
the
girls
arrived
they
came
through
the
door
after
a
moment
of
reluctant
hesitation
like
a
flood
of
brightly
colored
water
they
sat
down
in
the
laps
of
the
boys
on
chairs
on
the
edge
of
the
disarrayed
tables
they
were
served
with
innumerable
drinks
as
rapidly
as
the
liquor
could
be
brought
they
were
working
that
night
for
the
ten
dollars
promised
to
each
one
but
they
were
working
with
college
boys
which
was
a
rest
from
the
stream
of
affluent
and
paunchy
males
who
made
their
usual
escort
their
gaiety
was
better
than
assumed
hugo
had
never
seen
such
a
party
or
dreamed
of
one
his
vision
was
cleared
instantly
of
its
cobwebs
he
saw
three
boys
seize
one
girl
and
turn
her
heels
over
head
a
piano
was
moved
in
she
jumped
up
and
started
dancing
on
the
table
then
there
was
a
voice
at
his
side
hello
i
could
use
that
drink
if
you
can
spare
it
hugo
looked
at
the
girl
she
had
brown
hair
that
had
been
curled
her
lips
and
cheeks
were
heavily
rouged
and
the
corners
of
her
mouth
turned
down
in
a
sort
of
petulance
or
fatigue
but
she
was
pretty
and
her
body
showing
whitely
above
her
evening
dress
was
creamy
and
warm
he
gave
the
drink
to
her
she
sat
in
his
lap
gosh
he
whispered
she
laughed
i
saw
her
first
some
one
said
pulling
at
the
girl
arm
go
hugo
shouted
he
pushed
the
other
from
them
what
your
name
bessie
what
yours
hugo
the
girl
accepted
two
glasses
from
a
waiter
they
drained
them
looking
at
each
other
over
the
rims
got
any
money
hugo
hugo
had
he
carried
on
his
person
the
total
of
his
cash
assets
some
fifty
dollars
sure
i
have
fifty
dollars
he
answered
he
felt
her
red
lips
against
his
ear
let
you
and
me
duck
this
party
and
have
a
little
one
of
our
own
i
got
an
apartment
not
far
from
here
he
could
hear
the
pounding
of
his
heart
let
they
moved
unostentatiously
from
the
room
outside
in
the
hall
she
took
his
hand
they
ran
to
the
front
door
there
was
the
echo
of
bedlam
in
his
whirling
mind
when
they
walked
through
the
almost
deserted
street
she
called
to
a
taxi
and
they
were
driven
for
several
blocks
at
a
cheap
dance
hall
they
took
a
table
and
drank
more
liquor
when
his
head
was
turned
she
narrowed
her
eyes
and
calculated
the
effect
of
the
alcohol
against
the
dwindling
of
his
purse
they
danced
gee
you
a
swell
dancer
so
are
you
bessie
still
wan
na
go
home
with
bessie
mmmm
let
go
another
taxi
ride
the
lights
seethed
past
him
a
dark
house
and
three
flights
of
rickety
stairs
the
gritty
sound
of
a
key
in
a
lock
a
little
room
with
a
table
a
bed
two
chairs
a
turned
low
a
disheveled
profusion
of
female
garments
here
we
are
sit
down
hugo
looked
at
her
tensely
he
laughed
then
with
a
harsh
sound
she
flew
into
his
arms
returning
his
searching
caresses
with
startling
frankness
presently
they
moved
across
the
room
he
could
hear
the
noises
on
the
street
at
long
hot
intervals
hugo
opened
his
eyes
and
the
light
smote
them
with
pain
he
raised
his
head
wonderingly
his
stomach
crawled
with
a
foul
nausea
he
saw
the
dirty
room
bessie
was
not
in
it
he
staggered
to
the
and
was
sick
he
noticed
then
that
her
clothes
were
missing
the
fact
impressed
him
as
one
that
should
have
significance
he
rubbed
his
head
and
eyes
then
he
thought
accurately
he
crossed
the
room
and
felt
in
his
trousers
pockets
the
money
was
gone
at
first
it
did
not
seem
like
a
catastrophe
he
could
telegraph
to
his
father
for
more
money
then
he
realized
that
he
was
in
new
york
without
a
ticket
back
to
the
campus
separated
from
his
friends
and
not
knowing
the
address
of
the
toastmaster
he
could
not
find
his
fraternity
brothers
and
he
could
not
get
back
to
school
without
more
money
moreover
he
was
sick
he
dressed
with
miserable
slowness
and
went
down
to
the
street
served
him
right
he
had
been
a
fool
he
shrugged
a
sharp
wind
blew
out
of
a
bright
sky
maybe
he
thought
he
should
walk
back
to
webster
it
was
only
eighty
miles
and
that
distance
could
be
negotiated
in
less
than
two
hours
by
him
but
that
was
unwise
people
would
see
his
progress
he
sat
down
in
madison
square
park
and
looked
at
the
flatiron
building
with
a
leisurely
eye
a
fire
engine
surged
up
the
street
a
man
came
to
collect
the
trash
in
a
green
can
a
tramp
lay
down
and
was
ousted
by
a
policeman
by
and
by
he
realized
that
he
was
hungry
a
little
man
with
darting
eyes
took
a
seat
beside
him
he
regarded
hugo
at
short
intervals
at
length
he
said
you
got
a
dime
for
a
cup
of
coffee
his
words
were
blurred
by
accent
no
i
came
here
from
school
last
night
and
my
money
was
stolen
ah
there
was
a
tinge
of
discouragement
in
the
other
voice
and
hungry
perhaps
a
little
me
i
am
also
hungry
i
have
not
eaten
since
two
days
that
impressed
hugo
as
a
shameful
and
intolerable
circumstance
go
over
there
he
indicated
a
small
restaurant
and
eat
then
promise
to
send
the
money
by
mail
at
least
we
be
fed
that
way
we
will
be
thrown
to
the
street
on
our
faces
not
i
nobody
throws
me
on
my
face
and
i
look
out
for
you
they
crossed
the
thoroughfare
and
entered
the
restaurant
the
little
man
ordered
a
quantity
of
food
and
hugo
looking
guiltily
at
the
waiter
duplicated
the
order
they
became
distantly
acquainted
during
the
filched
repast
the
little
man
name
was
izzie
he
sold
rugs
but
he
was
out
of
work
eventually
they
finished
the
waiter
brought
the
check
he
was
a
large
man
whose
jowls
and
hips
and
shoulders
were
heavily
weighted
with
muscle
hugo
stood
up
listen
fellow
he
began
placidly
my
friend
and
i
have
a
cent
between
us
i
hugo
danner
from
webster
university
and
i
mail

price

he

no
further
the
waiter
spoke
in
a
thick
voice
so

his
fist
doubled
and
drew
back
hugo
did
not
shift
his
position
the
fist
came
forward
but
an
arm
like
stone
blocked
it
hugo
free
hand
barely
flicked
to
the
waiter
jaw
he
rolled
under
the
table
come
on
he
said
but
izzie
had
already
vanished
through
the
door
hugo
walked
hurriedly
up
the
street
and
turned
a
corner
a
hand
tugged
at
his
coat
he
turned
and
was
confronted
by
izzie
i

here
anyhow
they
made
their
way
toward
the
river
the
city
changed
character
on
the
other
side
of
the
elevated
railroad
and
presently
they
were
walking
through
a
dirty
congested
neighborhood
where
are
we
going
izzie
wait
a
minute
mr
danner
what
the
idea
you
wait
another
series
of
dirty
blocks
then
they
came
to
a
bulky
building
that
spread
a
canopy
over
the
sidewalk
here
izzie
said
and
pointed
his
finger
indicated
a
sign
which
hugo
read
twice
it
said

entered

lobby
of
the
gymnasium

for
the
swede
epstein
was
a
pale
fat
man
who
ignored
the
handicap
of
the
dank
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
roared
when
he
spoke
he
glanced
at
hugo
and
then
addressed
izzie
where

epstein
looked
at
hugo
and
then
was
shaken
by
laughter

for

hugo
followed
izzie
and
reached
him
in
time
to
see
a
bill
peeled
from
a
roll
which
was
extracted
with
great
intricacy
from
clothes
i

izzie

uneasily

poke

meal

right
izzie
i
wish
i
thought
ole
was
going
to
lick

hugo
wrote
his
name
under
a
printed
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
fight
managers
were
not
responsible
for
the
results
of
the
combat
the
man
who
led
him
to
a
was
filled
with
sympathy
and
advice
he
told
hugo
that
one
glance
at
ole
would
discourage
his
reckless
avarice
but
hugo
paid
no
attention
the
room
was
dirty
it
smelled
of
sweat
and
rubber
sneakers
he
sat
there
for
half
an
hour
reading
a
newspaper
outside
somewhere
he
could
hear
the
mumble
of
a
gathering
crowd
punctuated
by
the
voices
of
candy
and
at
last
they
brought
some
clothes
to
him
a
pair
of
trunks
that
flapped
over
his
loins
canvas
shoes
a
musty
bath
robe
when
the
door
of
his
room
opened
the
noise
of
the
crowd
was
louder
finally
it
was
hushed
he
heard
the
announcer
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
minister
coming
through
the
stained
windows
of
a
church
it
rose
and
fell
then
the
distant
note
of
the
gong
after
that
the
crowd
called
steadily
sometimes
in
loud
rage
and
sometimes
almost
in
a
whisper
finally
they
brought
ole
first
victim
into
hugo
cell
he
was
a
man
with
the
physique
of
a
bull
his
face
was
cut
and
his
eyes
were
darkening
one
of
the
men
heaving
his
stretcher
looked
at
hugo
better
beat
it
kid
while
you
can
still
do
it
on
your
own
feet
you
ai
even
got
the
reach
for
ole
he
a
grizzly
bo
he
just
about
kill
you
hugo
tightened
his
belt
and
swung
the
electric
light
back
and
forth
with
a
fist
another
man
expertly
strapped
his
fists
with
adhesive
tape
when
do
i
go
out
hugo
asked
you
mean
when
do
you
get
knocked
out
the
second
laughed
fight
well
if
you
determined
to
get
croaked
you
do
it
now
in
the
arena
it
was
dazzling
a
bank
of
noisy
people
rose
on
all
sides
of
him
hugo
walked
down
the
aisle
and
clambered
into
the
ring
ole
was
one
of
the
largest
men
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
there
was
no
doubt
of
his
six
feet
nine
inches
and
his
two
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
hugo
imagined
that
the
man
was
not
a
scientific
fighter
a
bruiser
well
he
knew
nothing
of
fighting
either
a
man
in
his
shirt
sleeves
stood
up
in
the
ring
and
bellowed
the
next
contestant
for
the
reward
of
fifty
dollars
to
stay
three
rounds
with
battling
ole
and
one
hundred
dollars
to
knock
him
out
is
h
smith
they
cheered
it
was
a
nasty
sound
filled
with
the
lust
for
blood
hugo
realized
that
he
was
excited
his
knees
wabbled
when
he
rose
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
took
the
monstrous
paw
of
the
swede
and
saw
his
unpleasant
smile
hugo
heart
was
pounding
for
one
instant
he
felt
weak
and
human
before
battling
ole
he
whispered
to
himself
quit
it
you
fool
you
know
better
you
ca
even
be
hurt
it
did
not
make
him
any
more
quiet
then
they
were
sitting
face
to
face
a
bell
rang
the
hall
became
silent
as
the
mountainous
swede
lumbered
from
his
corner
he
towered
over
hugo
who
stood
up
and
went
out
to
meet
him
like
david
approaching
goliath
to
the
crowd
the
spectacle
was
laughable
there
was
jeering
before
they
met
where
your
mamma
got
your
bottle
baby
put
the
poor
little
bastard
back
in
his
carriage
what
this
a
fight
or
a
freak
show
laughter
it
was
like
cold
water
to
hugo
his
face
set
he
looked
at
ole
the
swede
fist
moved
back
like
the
piston
of
a
great
engine
into
which
steam
has
been
let
slowly
then
it
came
forward
hugo
trained
to
see
and
act
in
keeping
with
his
gigantic
strength
dodged
easily
atta
boy
one
for
the
fist
went
back
and
came
again
and
again
as
if
that
piston
gathering
speed
had
broken
loose
and
was
flailing
through
the
screaming
air
hugo
dodged
like
a
beam
of
light
and
the
murderous
weapon
never
touched
him
the
spectators
began
to
applaud
his
speed
he
could
beat
the
swede
fist
every
time
run
him
kiddo
it
only
three
rounds
the
bell
ole
was
panting
as
he
sat
in
his
corner
his
gloves
dangling
he
cursed
in
his
native
tongue
too
little
to
hit
bell
the
second
round
was
the
same
hugo
never
attempted
to
touch
the
swede
only
to
avoid
him
and
the
man
worked
like
a
trojan
sweat
seethed
over
his
big
blank
face
his
small
eyes
sharpened
to
points
he
brought
his
whole
carcass
flinging
through
the
air
after
his
fist
but
every
blow
ended
in
a
sickening
wrench
that
missed
the
target
the
crowd
grew
more
excited
during
the
interval
between
the
second
and
third
rounds
there
was
betting
on
the
outcome
three
to
one
that
ole
would
connect
and
murder
the
boy
four
to
one
one
to
five
that
hugo
would
win
fifty
dollars
before
he
died
beneath
the
the
third
round
opened
the
crowd
suddenly
tired
of
the
sport
a
shrill
female
voice
reached
hugo
cold
concentrated
mind
keep
on
running
yellow
baby
so
they
wanted
a
killing
they
called
him
yellow
the
swede
was
on
him
elephantine
sweating
sucking
great
rumbling
breaths
of
air
swinging
his
fists
hugo
studied
the
motion
that
fist
to
that
side
up
down
now
like
hail
they
began
to
land
upon
the
swede
bewilderingly
everywhere
no
hope
of
guarding
every
blow
smashed
stung
ached
no
chance
to
swing
back
cover
up
his
arms
went
over
his
face
he
felt
rivets
drive
into
his
kidneys
he
reached
out
and
clinched
they
rocked
in
each
other
arms
dazed
by
that
bitter
onslaught
of
lightning
blows
ole
thought
only
to
lock
hugo
in
his
arms
and
crush
him
when
they
clinched
the
crowd
grown
instantly
hysterical
sank
back
in
despair
it
was
over
ole
could
break
the
little
man
back
they
saw
his
arms
spring
into
knots
jesus
hugo
fist
shot
between
their
chests
and
ole
was
thrown
violently
backward
impossible
he
lunged
back
crimson
to
kill
one
hand
guarding
his
jaw
easy
now
for
the
love
of
god
easy
hugo
said
to
himself
there
on
the
hand
at
the
chin
hugo
gloves
went
out
lift
him
it
connected
the
swede
left
the
floor
and
crumpled
slowly
with
a
series
of
bumping
sounds
and
how
the
hyenas
yelled
they
crowded
into
his
afterwards
epstein
came
to
his
side
before
he
had
dressed
come
out
and
have
a
mug
of
suds
kid
that
was
the
sweetest
fight
i
ever
hope
to
live
to
see
i
can
sign
you
up
for
a
fortune
right
now
i
can
make
you
champ
in
two
years
no
thanks
hugo
said
the
man
persisted
he
talked
earnestly
he
handed
hugo
a
bill
hugo
finished
his
dressing
izzie
wormed
his
way
in
fifty
dollars
i
won
yet
did
i
tole
you
mr
epstein
come
here
izzie
the
little
man
ran
to
shake
hugo
hand
but
it
was
extended
for
another
reason
i
want
that
fifty
you
won
he
said
unsmilingly
when
a
bird
tracks
along
for
a
free
feed
and
lets
another
guy
fight
for
him
and
has
a
roll
big
enough
to
stop
up
a
rainspout
he
owes
money
that
lunch
will
set
you
back
just
exactly
what
you
won
on
me
there
was
laughter
in
the
room
izzie
whimpered
ai
you
got
a
hundred
all
ready
that
i
got
for
you
ai
it
enough
that
you
got
it
ai
i
got
a
wife
wit
kids
yet
no
it
ai
yet
hugo
snapped
the
fingers
of
his
extended
hand
the
other
hand
doubled
significantly
izzie
gave
him
the
money
he
was
almost
in
tears
the
others
guffawed
wait
up
bo
give
us
your
address
if
you
ever
change
your
mind
you
can
pick
up
a
nice
livin
in
this
game
no
thanks
all
i
needed
was
railroad
fare
thank
you
gentlemen
and
no
one
undertook
to
hinder
hugo
departure
viii
greatness
seemed
to
elude
hugo
success
such
as
he
had
earned
was
inadequate
and
his
friendships
as
well
as
his
popularity
were
tinged
with
a
sort
of
question
that
he
never
understood
by
the
end
of
winter
he
was
well
established
in
webster
as
a
great
athlete
psi
delta
sang
his
praises
and
was
envied
his
deeds
lefty
and
chuck
treated
him
as
a
brother
and
hugo
perceived
none
of
that
treatment
and
none
of
that
society
was
quite
real
he
wondered
if
his
personality
was
so
meagre
that
it
was
not
equal
to
his
strength
he
wondered
if
his
strength
was
really
the
asset
he
had
dreamed
it
would
be
and
if
perhaps
other
people
were
not
different
from
him
in
every
way
so
that
any
close
human
contact
was
impossible
to
him
it
was
a
rather
tragic
question
to
absorb
a
man
so
filled
with
life
and
ambition
as
he
yet
every
month
had
raised
it
more
insistently
he
saw
other
men
sharing
their
inmost
souls
and
he
could
never
do
that
he
saw
those
around
him
breaking
their
hearts
and
their
lungs
for
the
university
and
although
it
was
never
necessary
for
him
to
do
that
he
doubted
that
he
could
if
he
would
webster
was
only
a
school
a
sentiment
rather
than
an
ideal
a
place
rather
than
a
goal
of
dreams
he
thought
that
he
was
cynical
he
thought
that
he
was
inhuman
it
worried
him
his
love
was
a
similar
experience
he
fell
in
love
twice
during
that
first
year
in
college
once
at
a
prom
with
a
girl
who
was
related
to
lefty
a
rich
socially
secure
girl
who
had
studied
abroad
and
who
almost
patronized
her
cousin
hugo
had
seen
her
dancing
and
her
long
slender
legs
and
arms
had
issued
an
almost
tangible
challenge
to
him
she
had
looked
over
shoulder
and
smiled
vaguely
they
had
met
hugo
danced
with
her
i
love
to
come
to
a
prom
she
said
it
makes
me
feel
young
again
how
old
are
you
she
ignored
the
obvious
temptation
to
be
coy
and
he
appreciated
that
it
seemed
reasonably
old
to
hugo
the
three
years
difference
in
their
ages
had
given
her
a
pinnacle
of
maturity
and
that
makes
you
old
he
reflected
she
nodded
her
name
was
iris
afterwards
hugo
thought
that
it
should
have
been
isis
half
goddess
half
animal
he
had
never
met
with
the
vanguard
of
emancipated
american
womanhood
before
then
you
the
great
hugo
danner
are
you
i
seen
your
picture
in
the
sporting
sections
she
read
sporting
sections
he
had
never
thought
of
a
woman
in
that
light
but
you
really
much
handsomer
you
have
more
sex
and
masculinity
and
you
seem
more
intelligent
then
between
the
dances
lefty
had
come
she
oh
she
a
sort
of
cousin
flies
in
all
the
high
altitudes
in
town
blue
book
and
all
that
better
look
out
hugo
she
plays
rough
she
does
look
rough
both
youths
watched
her
long
dark
hair
willowy
body
high
pale
forehead
thin
nose
red
mouth
smiling
like
a
lewd
agnostic
and
dancing
close
to
her
partner
enjoying
even
that
well
look
out
hugo
if
she
wants
to
play
do
let
her
play
with
your
heart
anything
else
is
quite
in
the
books
oh
she
came
to
the
stag
line
ignoring
a
sequence
of
invitations
and
asked
him
to
dance
they
went
out
on
the
velvet
campus
i
could
love
you
for
a
little
while
she
said
it
too
bad
you
have
to
play
football
is
that
an
excuse
she
smiled
remotely
you
being
disloyal
her
fan
moved
delicately
but
i
sha
chide
you
in
fact
i
stay
over
for
the
game
and
enjoy
the
anticipation
more
perhaps
but
you
have
to
win
it
to
win
me
i
not
a
soothing
type
it
will
be
easy
to
win
hugo
said
and
she
peered
through
the
darkness
with
admiration
because
he
had
made
his
ellipsis
of
the
object
very
plain
it
is
always
easy
for
you
to
win
is
it
she
countered
with
an
easy
mockery
and
hugo
shivered
the
game
was
won
hugo
had
made
his
touchdown
he
unfolded
a
note
she
had
written
on
the
back
of
a
score
card
at
my
hotel
at
ten
then
then
someone
lifted
his
eyes
to
praise
him
his
senses
swam
in
careful
anticipation
they
were
cheering
outside
the
a
different
sound
from
the
cheers
at
the
young
hilarious
happy
at
ten
he
bent
over
the
desk
and
was
told
to
go
to
her
room
the
clerk
shrugged
she
opened
the
door
one
light
was
burning
there
was
perfume
in
the
air
she
wore
only
a
translucent
kimono
of
silk
she
taught
him
a
great
many
things
that
night
and
iris
learned
something
too
so
that
she
never
came
back
to
hugo
and
kept
the
longing
for
him
as
a
sort
of
memory
which
she
made
hallowed
in
a
shorn
soul
it
was
for
her
a
single
asceticism
in
a
rather
selfish
life
hugo
loved
her
for
two
weeks
after
that
and
then
his
emotions
wearied
and
he
was
able
to
see
what
she
had
done
and
why
she
did
not
answer
his
letters
his
subdued
fierceness
was
a
vehement
fire
to
women
his
fiercer
appetite
was
the
cause
of
his
early
growth
in
a
knowledge
of
them
when
most
of
his
companions
were
finding
their
way
into
the
mysteries
of
sex
both
unhandily
and
with
much
turmoil
he
learned
well
and
abnormally
it
became
a
part
of
his
secret
self
another
barrier
to
the
level
of
the
society
that
surrounded
him
when
he
changed
the
name
of
iris
to
isis
in
his
thoughts
he
moved
away
from
the
psi
deltas
who
would
have
been
incapable
of
the
notion
in
person
he
stayed
among
them
but
in
spirit
he
felt
another
difference
which
he
struggled
to
reconcile
in
march
the
thaws
came
and
under
the
warming
sun
hugo
made
a
deliberate
attempt
to
fall
in
love
with
janice
who
was
the
daughter
of
his
french
professor
she
was
a
happy
innocent
little
girl
with
gold
hair
and
brown
eyes
that
lived
oddly
beneath
it
she
worshipped
hugo
he
petted
her
talked
through
long
evenings
to
her
tried
to
be
faithful
to
her
in
his
most
unfettered
dreams
and
once
considered
proposing
to
her
when
he
found
himself
unable
to
do
that
he
was
compelled
to
resist
an
impulse
to
seduce
her
ashamed
believing
himself
unfit
for
a
nice
girl
he
untangled
that
romance
as
painlessly
as
he
could
separating
himself
from
janice
little
by
little
and
denying
every
accusation
of
waning
interest
then
for
a
month
he
believed
that
he
could
never
be
satisfied
by
any
woman
that
he
was
superior
to
women
he
read
the
lives
of
great
lovers
and
adulterers
and
he
wished
that
he
could
see
bessie
who
had
taken
his
money
long
before
in
new
york
city
she
appealed
to
him
then
more
than
all
the
others
probably
he
thought
because
he
was
drunk
and
had
not
viewed
her
in
sharp
perspective
for
hours
he
meditated
on
women
while
he
longed
constantly
to
possess
a
woman
but
the
habitual
routine
of
his
life
did
not
suffer
he
attended
his
classes
and
lectures
played
on
the
basketball
team
tried
tentatively
to
write
for
the
campus
newspaper
learned
to
perform
indifferently
on
the
mandolin
and
made
himself
into
the
semblance
of
an
ideal
college
man
his
criticism
of
college
then
was
at
its
lowest
ebb
he
spent
christmas
in
new
york
at
lefty
foresman
parents
elaborate
home
slightly
intoxicated
through
the
two
weeks
hastening
to
the
opera
to
balls
and
parties
ill
at
ease
when
presented
to
people
whose
names
struck
his
ears
familiarly
seeing
for
the
first
time
the
exaggeration
of
scale
on
which
the
very
rich
live
and
wondering
constantly
why
he
never
met
iris
wishing
for
and
fearing
that
meeting
while
he
wondered
when
his
first
year
at
college
was
near
to
its
end
and
that
still
and
respectful
silence
that
marks
the
passing
of
a
senior
class
had
fallen
over
the
campus
hugo
realized
with
a
shock
that
he
would
soon
be
on
his
way
back
to
indian
creek
then
suddenly
he
saw
what
an
amazing
and
splendid
thing
that
year
at
college
had
been
he
realized
how
it
had
filled
his
life
to
the
brim
with
activities
of
which
he
had
not
dreamed
how
it
had
shaped
him
so
that
he
would
be
almost
a
stranger
in
his
own
home
how
it
had
aged
and
educated
him
in
the
business
of
living
when
the
time
of
parting
with
his
new
friends
drew
near
he
understood
that
they
were
valuable
to
him
in
spite
of
his
questioning
and
they
made
it
clear
that
he
would
be
missed
by
them
at
last
he
shared
a
feeling
with
his
classmates
a
fond
sadness
an
illimitable
poignancy
that
was
young
and
unadulterated
by
motive
he
was
perversely
happy
when
he
became
aware
of
it
he
felt
somewhat
justified
for
being
himself
and
living
his
life
a
day
or
two
before
college
closed
he
received
a
letter
from
his
father
it
was
the
third
he
had
received
during
the
year
it
said
dear
son
your
mother
and
i
have
decided
to
break
the
news
to
you
before
you
leave
for
home
because
there
may
be
better
opportunities
for
you
in
the
east
than
here
at
indian
creek
when
you
went
away
to
webster
university
i
agreed
to
take
care
of
all
your
expenses
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
i
felt
for
my
only
son
the
two
thousand
dollars
your
mother
and
i
had
saved
seemed
ample
for
your
four
years
but
the
bills
we
have
received
as
well
as
your
own
demands
have
been
staggering
in
march
when
a
scant
six
hundred
dollars
of
the
original
fund
remained
i
invested
the
money
in
a
mine
stock
which
the
salesman
said
would
easily
net
the
six
thousand
dollars
you
appeared
to
need
i
now
find
to
my
chagrin
that
the
stock
is
worthless
i
am
unable
to
get
back
my
purchase
money
it
will
be
impossible
during
the
coming
year
for
me
to
let
you
have
more
than
five
hundred
dollars
perhaps
with
what
you
earn
this
summer
and
with
the
exercise
of
economy
you
can
get
along
i
trust
so
but
anxious
as
we
are
to
see
you
again
we
felt
that
in
the
light
of
such
information
you
might
prefer
to
remain
in
the
east
to
earn
what
you
can
we
are
both
despondent
over
the
situation
and
we
wish
that
we
could
do
more
than
tender
our
regrets
but
we
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
find
some
solution
to
this
situation
thus
with
our
very
warmest
affection
and
our
fondest
hope
we
wish
you
good
fortune
your
loving
father
abednego
danner
hugo
read
the
letter
down
to
the
last
period
after
the
rather
tremulous
signature
his
emotions
were
confused
touched
by
the
earnest
and
pathetically
futile
efforts
of
his
father
and
by
the
attempt
of
that
lonely
little
man
to
express
what
was
perhaps
a
great
affection
hugo
was
nevertheless
aghast
at
a
prospect
that
he
had
not
considered
he
was
going
to
be
thrown
into
the
world
on
his
own
resources
and
resting
his
frame
in
his
worn
chair
a
frame
capable
of
smashing
into
banks
and
taking
the
needed
money
without
fear
of
punishment
hugo
began
to
wonder
dismally
if
he
was
able
even
to
support
himself
no
trade
no
occupation
suggested
itself
he
had
already
experienced
some
of
the
merciless
coldness
of
the
world
the
boys
would
all
leave
soon
and
then
he
would
be
alone
unprovided
for
helpless
hugo
was
frightened
he
read
the
letter
again
his
wistful
thoughts
of
his
parents
diminishing
before
the
reality
of
his
predicament
he
counted
his
money
eighty
dollars
in
the
bank
and
twelve
in
his
pockets
he
was
glad
he
had
started
an
account
after
his
experience
with
bessie
he
was
glad
that
he
had
husbanded
more
than
enough
to
pay
his
fare
to
indian
creek
dollars
he
could
live
on
that
for
a
long
time
perhaps
for
the
summer
and
he
would
be
able
to
get
some
sort
of
job
he
was
strong
anyway
that
comforted
him
he
looked
out
of
his
window
and
tried
to
enumerate
the
things
that
he
could
do
all
sorts
of
farm
work
he
could
drive
a
team
in
the
city
he
could
work
on
the
docks
he
considered
nothing
but
manual
labor
it
would
offer
more
gradually
his
fear
that
he
would
starve
if
left
to
his
own
devices
ebbed
from
him
and
it
was
replaced
by
grief
that
he
could
not
return
to
webster
fourteen
hundred
dollars
that
was
the
cost
of
his
freshman
year
he
made
a
list
of
the
things
he
could
do
without
of
the
work
he
could
do
to
help
himself
through
college
perhaps
he
could
return
the
fear
slowly
diminished
he
would
be
a
working
student
in
the
year
to
come
he
hated
the
idea
his
fraternity
had
taken
no
members
from
that
class
of
humble
young
men
who
rose
at
dawn
and
scrubbed
floors
and
waited
on
tables
to
win
the
priceless
gem
of
education
lefty
and
chuck
would
be
chilly
toward
such
a
step
they
would
even
offer
him
money
to
avoid
it
it
was
a
sad
circumstance
at
best
when
that
period
of
tribulation
passed
hugo
became
a
man
but
he
suffered
keenly
from
his
unwonted
fears
for
some
time
the
calm
and
suave
youth
who
had
made
love
to
iris
was
buried
beneath
his
frightened
and
imaginative
adolescence
it
wore
out
the
last
of
his
childishness
immediately
afterwards
he
learned
about
money
and
how
it
is
earned
he
sat
there
in
the
dormitory
almost
trembling
with
uncertainty
and
used
mighty
efforts
to
do
the
things
he
felt
he
must
do
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
father
which
began
dear
dad
why
in
sam
hill
did
you
tell
me
you
were
being
reamed
so
badly
by
your
son
and
i
have
shovelled
out
and
dug
up
some
money
for
myself
long
ago
on
rereading
that
letter
he
realized
that
its
tone
was
false
he
wrote
another
in
which
he
apologized
with
simple
sincerity
for
the
condition
he
had
unknowingly
created
and
in
which
he
expressed
every
confidence
that
he
could
take
care
of
himself
in
the
future
he
bore
that
braver
front
through
the
last
days
of
school
he
shook
lefty
hand
warmly
and
looked
fairly
into
his
eyes
well
so
long
old
sock
be
good
be
good
hugo
and
do
weaken
we
need
all
your
beef
next
year
decided
what
you
going
to
do
yet
no
have
you
lefty
shrugged
i
suppose
i
got
to
go
abroad
with
the
family
as
usual
they
wrote
a
dirty
letter
about
the
allowance
i
not
have
next
year
if
i
did
why
do
you
come
with
us
iris
be
there
hugo
grinned
no
sir
iris
once
is
very
nice
but
no
man
equal
to
iris
twice
his
grin
became
a
chuckle
and
that
a
poem
which
you
can
say
to
iris
if
you
see
her
and
tell
her
i
hope
it
makes
her
mad
lefty
blue
eyes
sparkled
with
appreciation
danner
was
a
wonderful
boy
full
of
wit
and
not
dumb
like
most
of
his
kind
getting
smooth
too
be
a
great
man
too
bad
to
leave
him
even
for
the
summer
well
so
long
old
man
hugo
watched
lefty
lift
his
bags
into
a
cab
and
roll
away
in
the
warm
june
dust
then
chuck
well
hugo
see
you
next
september
yeah
take
care
of
yourself
no
chance
of
your
going
abroad
is
there
because
we
sure
could
paint
the
old
avenue
de
red
if
you
did
not
this
year
chuck
well
do
take
any
wooden
money
do
do
anything
you
would
eat
hugo
felt
a
lump
in
his
throat
he
could
not
say
any
more
farewells
the
campus
was
almost
deserted
no
meals
would
be
served
after
the
next
day
he
stared
at
the
vacant
dormitories
and
listened
to
the
waning
sound
of
departures
a
train
puffed
and
fumed
at
the
station
it
was
filled
with
boys
going
away
he
went
to
his
room
and
packed
he
leave
too
when
his
were
filled
he
looked
round
the
room
with
damp
eyes
he
thought
that
he
was
going
to
cry
mastered
himself
and
then
did
cry
some
time
later
he
remembered
iris
and
stopped
crying
he
walked
to
the
station
recalling
his
first
journey
in
the
other
direction
his
green
suit
the
trunk
he
had
carried
grand
old
place
webster
suddenly
gone
dead
all
over
there
would
be
a
train
for
new
york
in
half
an
hour
he
took
it
some
of
the
students
talked
to
him
on
the
trip
to
the
city
then
they
left
him
alone
in
the
great
vacuum
of
the
terminal
the
glittering
corridors
were
filled
with
people
he
wondered
if
he
could
find
bessie
house
at
a
restaurant
he
ate
supper
when
he
emerged
it
was
dark
he
asked
his
way
found
a
hotel
registered
in
a
room
went
out
on
the
street
again
he
walked
to
the
raven
then
he
took
a
cab
he
remembered
bessie
house
an
old
woman
answered
the
door
bessie
bessie
no
girl
by
that
name
i
remember
hugo
described
her
oh
that
tart
she
ran
out
on
me
owin
a
rent
when
was
that
some
time
last
fall
oh
hugo
meditated
the
woman
spoke
again
i
did
hear
from
one
of
my
other
girls
that
she
gone
to
work
at
coney
but
i
ai
had
time
to
look
her
up
owes
me
four
dollars
she
does
but
bessie
as
you
calls
her
her
name
sue
was
never
much
good
still
the
woman
scrutinized
hugo
and
giggled
bessie
ai
the
only
girl
in
the
world
i
got
a
cute
little
piece
up
here
named
palmerlee
says
only
the
other
night
she
lonely
glad
to
interdooce
you
hugo
thought
of
his
small
capital
no
thanks
he
walked
away
a
warm
moon
was
dimly
sensible
above
the
lights
of
the
street
he
decided
to
go
to
coney
island
and
look
for
the
lost
bessie
it
would
cost
him
only
a
dime
and
she
owed
him
money
he
smiled
a
little
savagely
and
thought
that
he
would
collect
its
equivalent
then
he
boarded
the
subway
cursing
himself
for
a
fool
and
cursing
his
appetite
for
the
fool
master
why
did
he
chase
that
particular
little
harlot
on
an
evening
when
his
mind
should
be
bent
toward
more
serious
purposes
certainly
not
because
he
had
any
intention
of
getting
back
his
money
because
he
wished
to
surprise
her
because
he
was
angry
that
she
had
cheated
him
or
because
she
was
the
only
woman
in
new
york
whom
he
knew
he
decided
it
was
the
last
reason
finally
the
train
reached
coney
island
and
hugo
descended
into
the
fantastic
on
the
street
below
he
realized
the
ridiculousness
of
his
quest
as
he
saw
the
miles
of
thronging
people
in
the
loud
streets
see
the
fat
woman
see
esmerelda
the
beautiful
fat
woman
she
weighs
six
hundred
pounds
she
had
a
dozen
lovers
she
the
fattest
woman
in
the
world
a
sensation
dressed
in
the
robes
of
cleopatra
robes
that
took
a
bolt
of
cloth
but
she
so
fat
they
conceal
nothing
ladies
and
gentlemen
see
the
beautiful
fat
woman
a
roller
coaster
circled
through
the
skies
with
a
noise
that
was
audible
above
the
staccato
voice
and
dashed
itself
at
the
earth
below
a
whirled
goldenly
and
a
band
struck
up
a
strident
march
hugo
smelled
stale
beer
and
frying
food
he
heard
the
clang
of
a
bell
as
a
weight
was
driven
up
to
it
by
the
shoulders
of
a
young
gentleman
in
a
pink
shirt
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
ladies
and
gentlemen
come
in
and
see
thorndyke
the
great
professor
of
physical
culture
from
munich
germany
he
can
bend
a
spike
in
his
bare
hands
an
elephant
can
pass
over
his
body
without
harming
him
he
can
lift
a
weight
of
one
ton
hugo
laughed
two
girls
saw
him
and
brushed
close
buy
us
a
drink
sport
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
hugo
wondered
what
sort
of
strong
man
he
would
make
perhaps
he
could
go
into
competition
with
thorndyke
he
saw
himself
pictured
in
gaudy
reds
and
yellows
holding
up
an
enormous
weight
he
remembered
that
he
was
looking
for
bessie
then
he
saw
another
girl
she
was
sitting
at
a
table
alone
that
fact
was
significant
he
sat
beside
her
hello
tough
she
said
hello
wan
na
buy
me
a
beer
hugo
bought
a
beer
and
looked
at
the
girl
her
hair
was
black
and
straight
her
mouth
was
straight
it
was
painted
scarlet
her
eyes
were
hard
and
dark
but
her
body
as
if
to
atone
for
her
face
was
made
in
a
series
of
soft
curves
that
fitted
exquisitely
into
her
black
silk
dress
he
tortured
himself
looking
at
her
she
permitted
it
sullenly
you
can
buy
me
a
sandwich
if
you
want
i
ai
eaten
he
bought
a
sandwich
wondering
if
she
was
telling
the
truth
she
ate
ravenously
he
bought
another
and
then
a
second
glass
of
beer
after
that
she
rose
you
can
come
with
me
if
you
wan
na
odd
no
conversation
no
vivacity
only
a
dull
submission
that
was
not
in
keeping
with
her
appearance
have
you
had
enough
to
eat
he
asked
it
do
she
responded
they
turned
into
a
side
street
and
moved
away
from
the
shimmering
lights
and
the
morass
of
people
presently
they
entered
a
dingy
frame
house
and
went
upstairs
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
no
furniture
only
a
flickering
she
unlocked
a
door
come
in
he
looked
at
her
again
she
took
off
her
hat
and
arranged
her
dark
hair
so
that
it
looped
almost
over
one
eye
hugo
wondered
at
her
silence
i
did
mean
to
rush
he
said
well
i
did
got
ta
make
some
more
it
be
she
hesitated
two
bucks
the
girl
sat
down
and
wept
aw
hell
she
said
finally
looking
at
him
with
a
shameless
defiance
i
guess

a
rotten
tart
i
was
in
a
show

god
she
removed
her
dress
with
a
sweeping
motion
hugo
looked
at
her
filled
with
pity
filled
with
remorse
at
his
sudden
surrender
to
her
passionate
good
looks
intensely
discomfited
listen

have
a
roll
in
my
pocket
i
damn

to
let
you
go
on
the
street
simply
because
you
broke
not
when
you
hate
it
so
much
charlotte
shut
her
eyes
tight
and
pressed
out
the
last
tears
which
ran
into
her
rouge
and
streaked
it
with
mascara
that
sure
white
of
you
i
do
know
maybe
it
selfish
i
had
an
awful
yen
for
you
when
i
sat
down
at
that
table
but
let
not
worry
about
it
now

out
and
get
a
decent
dinner

me
to
go
out
and
eat
now
sure
why
not
but
you
ai
forget
it
come
on
charlotte
sniffled
and
buried
her
black
tresses
in
her
black
dress
she
pulled
it
over
the
curves
of
her
hips
she
inspected
herself
in
a
spotted
mirror
and
sniffled
again
then
she
laughed
a
throaty
gurgling
laugh
her
hands
moved
swiftly
and
soon
she
turned
how
am
i
wonderful
let
go
she
tucked
her
hand
under
his
arm
when
they
reached
the
street
hugo
walked
silently
he
wondered
why
he
was
doing
it
and
to
what
it
would
lead
it
seemed
good
wholly
good
to
have
a
girl
at
his
side
again
especially
a
girl
over
whom
he
had
so
strong
a
claim
they
stopped
before
a
restaurant
that
advertised
its
sea
food
and
its
steaks
she
sat
down
with
an
apologetic
smile
i
afraid
i
goin
to
eat
you
out
of
house
and
home
go
ahead
i
had
a
big
supper
but
i
string
along
with
some
pie
and
cheese
and
beer
charlotte
studied
the
menu
mind
if
i
have
a
little
steak
hugo
shook
his
head
slowly
waiter
a
big
and
some
lyonnaise
potatoes
and
some
string
beans
and
corn
and
a
salad
and
ice
cream
bring
some
pie
and
cheese
for
me
and
a
beer
gosh
charlotte
said
hugo
watched
her
eat
the
food
he
knew
such
pity
as
he
had
seldom
felt
poor
little
kid
all
alone
scared
going
on
the
street
because
she
would
starve
otherwise
it
made
him
feel
strong
and
capable
before
the
meal
was
finished
she
was
talking
furiously
her
pathetic
life
was
unravelled
i
come
from
brooklyn
old
man
took
to
drink
an
ma
beat
it
with
a
gent
from
astoria
never
knew
what
happened
to
her
i
kept
house
for
the
old
man
till
he
tried
to
get
funny
with
me
burlesque
on
the
road
the
leading
man
he
flew
the
coop
when
i
told
him
and
then
when
it
came
it
was
dead
another
job
the
manager
coney
and
her
dismissal
i
just
could
let
have
it
when
i
did
like
mister
guess
i
not
tough
like
the
other
girls
my
mother
was
french
and
she
brought
me
up
kind
of
decent
well
the
little
outward
turning
of
her
hands
the
shrug
of
her
shoulders
do
worry
charlotte
i
wo
let
them
eat
you
i
set
you
up
to
a
decent
room
and
we
go
out
and
find
some
jobs
here
you
do
have
to
do
that
mister
i
make
out
all
i
needed
was
a
square
and
another
day
charlotte
sighed
and
smoked
a
cigarette
with
her
coffee
then
they
went
out
on
the
street
and
mixed
with
the
throng
the
voices
of
a
score
of
barkers
wheedled
them
hugo
began
to
feel
gay
he
took
charlotte
to
see
the
strong
man
and
watched
his
feats
with
a
critical
eye
he
took
her
on
the
roller
coaster
and
became
taut
and
laughing
when
she
screamed
and
held
him
then
laughing
louder
than
before
they
went
through
steeplechase
she
fell
in
the
rolling
barrel
and
he
carried
her
out
they
crossed
over
moving
staircases
and
lost
themselves
in
a
maze
and
slid
down
polished
chutes
into
fountains
of
light
and
excited
screaming
always
afterwards
her
hand
found
his
arm
her
great
dark
eyes
looked
into
his
and
laughed
always
they
turned
toward
the
other
men
and
girls
with
a
proud
and
haughty
expression
that
pointed
to
hugo
as
her
man
her
conquest
later
they
danced
they
drank
more
beer
golly
she
whispered
as
she
snuggled
against
him
you
sure
strut
a
mean
fox
trot
so
do
you
charlotte
i
been
doin
it
a
lot
i
guess
the
brazen
crash
of
a
finale
the
table
a
babble
of
voices
voices
of
people
snatching
pleasure
from
coney
island
gaudy
barrel
of
cheap
amusements
hugo
liked
it
then
he
liked
the
smell
and
touch
of
the
multitude
and
the
incessant
hysteria
of
its
presence
after
midnight
the
music
became
more
aggravating
muted
insinuating
several
of
the
dancers
were
drunk
one
of
them
tried
to
cut
in
hugo
shook
his
head
gee
charlotte
said
i
was
sure
hopin
you
would
let
him
why
i
never
thought
of
it
most
fellows
would
he
a
tough
it
was
an
introduction
to
an
unfamiliar
world
the
tough
came
to
their
table
and
asked
for
a
dance
in
thick
accents
charlotte
paled
and
accepted

hugo
said
before
i
take
a
poke
at
you
the
intruder
answer
was
a
swinging
fist
which
missed
hugo
by
a
wide
margin
hugo
stood
and
dropped
him
with
a
single
clean
blow
the
manager
came
up
expostulated
ordered
the
tough
inert
form
from
the
floor
started
the
music

should
ought
to
have
done

for
me

wishin

wishin
for
the
day
when

knuckles

hugo
laughed
hey
waiter
two
beers
when
she
yawned
he
took
her
out
to
the
boulevard
and
walked
at
her
side
toward
the
shabby
house
they
reached
the
steps
and
charlotte
began
to
cry
what
the
matter
i
was
goin
to
thank
you
but
i
do
know
how
it
was
too
nice
of

looked

his
face
wistfully
say

charlotte
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
and
kissed
him
he
felt
her
breath
on
his
lips
and
the
warmth
of
her
body
you
got
ta
kid
you
all
i
ever
had
please
please
hugo
walked
up
the
stairs
thoughtfully
in
her
small
room
he
watched
her
disrobe
so
willingly
now
so
eagerly
she
turned
back
the
covers
of
the
bed
it
ai
much
of
a
dump
baby
but
i
make
you
like
it
much
later
in
the
abyss
of
darkness
he
heard
her
voice
sleepy
and
still
husky
say
mister
what
your
name
in
the
morning
they
went
down
to
the
boulevard
together
the
gay
débris
of
the
night
before
lay
in
the
street
and
men
were
sweeping
it
away
but
their
spirits
were
high
they
had
breakfast
together
in
a
quiet
enchantment
once
she
kissed
him
would
you
like
to
keep
house
for
me
he
asked
do
you
mean
it
she
seemed
to
doubt
every
instant
that
good
fortune
had
descended
permanently
upon
her
she
was
like
a
dreamer
who
anticipated
a
sombre
awakening
even
while
he
clung
to
the
bliss
of
his
dream
sure
i
mean
it
i
get
a
job
and
we
find
an
apartment
and
you
can
spend
your
spare
time
swimming
and
lying
on
the
beach
he
knew
a
twinge
of
unexpected
jealousy
that
is
if
you
promise
not
to
look
at
all
the
men
who
are
going
to
look
at
you
he
was
ashamed
of
that
statement
charlotte
however
was
not
sufficiently
civilized
to
be
displeased
do
you
think
i
the
first
gent
that
ever
worried
about
what
i
did
in
my
spare
moments
why
if
you
brought
home
a
few
bucks
to
most
of
the
birds
i
know
they
would
even
ask
how
you
earned
it
they
be
so
busy
lookin
for
another
girl
an
a
shot
of
gin
well
let
go
hugo
went
to
one
of
the
largest
side
shows
after
some
questioning
he
found
the
manager
i
smith
he
said
and
i
want
to
apply
for
a
job
doin
what
this
is
my
wife
the
manager
stared
and
nodded
charlotte
took
his
arm
and
rubbed
it
against
herself
thinking
perhaps
that
it
was
a
wifely
gesture
hugo
smiled
inwardly
and
then
looked
at
the
sprawled
form
of
the
manager
there
to
that
and
dour
man
who
was
almost
unlike
a
human
being
he
was
going
to
offer
the
first
sale
of
his
majestic
strength
a
manager
sitting
behind
a
dirty
desk
in
a
dirty
building
a
act
hugo
said
charlotte
tittered
she
thought
that
the
bravado
of
her
new
friend
was
the
limits
of
good
sense
the
manager
sat
up
i
like
to
have
a
good
strong
man
yes
the
show
needs
one
but
you
not
the
bird
you
have
got
the
beef
go
over
and
watch
that
damned
german
work
hugo
bent
over
and
fastened
one
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
on
which
the
manager
sat
without
evidence
of
effort
he
lifted
the
chair
and
its
occupant
high
over
his
head
for
christ
sake
let
me
down
the
manager
said
hugo
swung
him
through
the
air
in
a
wide
arc
i
say
mister
that
three
times
stronger
than
that
german
and
i
want
your
job
if
i
look
strong
enough
i
wear
some
padded
tights
and
i
give
you
a
show
that
be
worth
the
admission
but
i
want
a
slice
of
the
entrance
price
and
maybe
a
separate
tent
see
my
name
is
hogarth
he
winked
at
charlotte
and
you
never
be
sorry
you
took
me
on
the
manager
panting
and
astonished
was
returned
to
the
floor
his
anger
struggled
with
his
pleasure
at
hugo
showmanship
well
what
else
can
you
do
is
pretty
stale
hugo
thought
quickly
i
can
bend
a
railroad
rail
not
a
spike
i
can
lift
a
horse
with
one
one
shoulder
i
can
chin
myself
on
my
little
finger
i
can
set
a
bear
trap
with
my
teeth
that
a
good
number
i
can
push
up
just
twice
as
much
weight
as
any
one
else
in
the
game
and
you
can
print
a
challenge
on
my
tent
i
can
pull
a
boa
constrictor
straight
we
give
you
a
chance
come
around
here
at
three
this
afternoon
with
your
stuff
and
we
try
your
act
does
this
lady
work
in
it
help
yes
charlotte
said
hugo
nodded
she
my
assistant
they
left
the
building
and
when
she
was
sure
they
were
out
of
earshot
charlotte
said
what
do
you
do
strong
boy
fake
no
i
do
them
aw
you
do
need
to
kid
me
i
not
you
saw
me
lift
him
did
you
well
that
was
nothing
jeest
that
i
should
live
to
see
the
day
i
got
a
bird
like
you
until
three
hugo
and
charlotte
occupied
their
time
with
feverish
activity
they
found
a
small
apartment
not
far
from
the
it
was
clean
and
bright
and
it
had
windows
on
two
sides
its
furniture
was
nearly
new
and
charlotte
with
tears
in
her
eyes
sat
in
all
the
chairs
lay
on
the
bed
took
the
from
the
drawer
in
the
kitchen
table
and
spun
it
in
an
empty
bowl
they
went
out
together
and
bought
a
quantity
and
a
variety
of
food
they
ate
an
early
luncheon
and
hugo
set
out
to
gather
the
properties
for
his
demonstration
at
three
before
a
dozen
men
he
gave
an
exhibition
of
strength
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
seen
in
any
museum
of
human
abnormalities
when
he
went
back
to
his
apartment
charlotte
in
a
gingham
dress
which
she
had
bought
with
part
of
the
money
he
had
given
her
was
preparing
dinner
he
took
her
on
his
lap
did
you
get
the
job
sure
i
did
fifty
a
week
and
ten
per
cent
of
the
gate
receipts
gee
that
a
lot
of
money
hugo
nodded
and
kissed
her
he
was
very
happy
happier
in
a
certain
way
than
he
had
ever
been
or
ever
would
be
again
his
livelihood
was
assured
he
was
going
to
live
with
a
woman
to
have
one
always
near
to
love
and
to
share
his
life
it
was
that
concept
of
companionship
above
all
other
things
which
made
him
glad
two
days
later
as
hugo
worked
to
prepare
the
vehicles
of
his
exhibition
he
heard
an
altercation
outside
the
tent
that
had
been
erected
for
him
a
voice
said
whatcha
tryin
to
do
there
anyhow
why
i
was
making
this
strong
man
as
i
saw
him
a
man
with
the
expression
of
strength
in
his
face
but
you
got
ta
bat
robe
on
him
what
we
want
is
muscles
muscles
bo
bigger
an
better
than
any
picture
of
any
strong
man
ever
made
put
one
here
an
one
there
but
that
is
correct
anatomy
to
hell
wit
that
stuff
put
one
there
i
says
but
he
be
out
of
drawing
awkward
absurd
say
listen
do
you
want
ten
bucks
for
painting
this
sign
or
shall
i
give
it
to
some
one
else
very
well
i
do
as
you
say
only
it
is
right
hugo
walked
out
of
the
tent
a
young
man
was
bending
over
a
huge
sheet
made
of
many
lengths
of
oilcloth
sewn
together
he
was
a
small
person
with
pale
eyes
and
a
white
skin
beside
him
stood
the
manager
eyeing
critically
the
strokes
applied
to
the
cloth
in
a
state
was
the
young
man
picture
of
the
imaginary
hogarth
that
pretty
good
hugo
said
the
young
man
smiled
apologetically
it
is
quite
right
you
can
see
for
yourself
you
have
no
muscles
there
and
there
i
suppose
hogarth
yes
well
i
tried
to
explain
the
anatomy
of
it
but
smoots
says
anatomy
does
matter
so
here
we
go
he
made
a
broad
orange
streak
hugo
smiled
smoots
is
not
an
anatomical
critic
of
any
renown
i
say
smoots
let
him
paint
it
as
he
sees
best
god
knows
the
other
posters
are
atrocious
enough
the
youth
looked
up
from
his
work
good
god
do
tell
me
really
hogarth
sure
why
not
well
well
i
i
guess
it
was
your
english
that
funny
and
i
do
blame
you
hugo
realized
that
the
young
was
a
person
of
some
culture
he
was
about
hugo
age
although
he
seemed
younger
on
first
glance
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
a
college
man
smoots
had
moved
away
but
for
the
love
of
god
tell
any
one
around
here
the
painter
stopped
is
that
so
and
you
doing
this
to
make
money
yes
well
i
be
doggoned
me
too
i
study
at
the
school
of
design
in
the
winter
and
in
the
summer
i
come
out
here
to
do
signs
and
lightning
portraits
and
whatever
else
i
can
to
make
the
money
for
it
sometimes
he
added
i
pick
up
more
than
a
thousand
bucks
in
a
season
this
is
my
fourth
year
at
it
there
was
in
the
young
artist
eye
a
hint
of
amusement
a
suggestion
that
they
were
in
league
hugo
liked
him
he
sat
down
on
a
box
live
here
yes
three
blocks
away
me
too
why
not
come
up
and
have
supper
with
my
wife
and
me
are
you
married
the
artist
commenced
work
again
hugo
hesitated
yeah
sure
i
come
up
my
name
valentine
mitchel
i
ca
shake
hands
just
now
it
been
a
long
time
since
i
talked
to
any
one
who
say
and
when
later
in
the
day
they
walked
toward
hugo
home
he
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
charlotte
the
young
painter
would
not
understand
why
he
a
college
man
chose
so
ignorant
a
mate
on
the
other
hand
he
owed
it
to
charlotte
to
keep
their
secret
and
he
was
not
obliged
to
make
any
explanation
valentine
mitchel
was
however
a
young
man
of
some
sensitivity
if
he
winced
at
charlotte
pleased
to
meetcher
he
did
not
show
it
later
after
an
excellent
and
hilarious
meal
he
must
have
guessed
the
situation
he
went
home
reluctantly
and
hugo
was
delighted
with
him
he
had
been
urbane
and
filled
with
anecdotes
of
greenwich
village
and
life
of
paris
whither
his
struggling
footsteps
had
taken
him
for
a
hallowed
year
and
with
his
acceptance
of
hugo
came
an
equally
warm
pleasure
in
charlotte
company
he
a
good
little
kid
charlotte
said
yes
i
glad
i
picked
him
up
the
gala
opening
of
hogarth
studio
of
strength
took
place
a
few
nights
afterwards
it
proved
even
more
successful
than
smoots
had
hoped
the
flamboyant
advertising
posters
attracted
crowds
to
see
the
man
who
could
set
a
bear
trap
with
his
teeth
who
could
pull
an
angry
boa
constrictor
into
a
straight
line
before
ranks
of
gaping
faces
that
were
supplanted
by
new
ranks
every
hour
hugo
performed
charlotte
resplendent
in
a
black
dress
that
left
her
knees
bare
and
a
red
sash
that
all
but
obliterated
the
dress
helped
hugo
with
his
ponderous
props
setting
off
his
strength
by
contrast
and
sold
the
pamphlets
hugo
had
written
at
smoots
suggestion
pamphlets
that
purported
to
give
away
the
secret
of
hogarth
phenomenal
muscle
power
valentine
mitchel
watched
the
entire
performance
when
it
was
over
he
said
to
hugo
now
you
better
beat
it
back
and
get
a
hot
bath
you
probably
all
in
yes
charlotte
said
come
i
myself
will
bathe
you
hugo
grinned
hell
no
now
we
all
going
on
a
bender
to
celebrate
we
eat
at
villapigue
and
we
take
a
moonlight
sail
they
went
together
marvelling
at
his
vitality
gay
young
and
living
in
a
world
that
they
managed
to
forget
did
not
exist
the
night
was
warm
the
days
that
followed
were
warmer
the
crowds
came
and
the
brassy
music
hooted
and
coughed
over
them
night
and
day
there
are
in
the
lives
of
almost
every
man
and
woman
certain
brief
episodes
that
enduring
for
a
long
or
a
short
time
leave
in
the
memory
a
sense
of
completeness
to
those
moments
humanity
returns
for
refuge
for
courage
and
for
solace
it
was
of
such
material
that
hugo
next
two
months
were
composed
the
items
of
it
were
nearly
all
sensuous
the
sound
of
the
sea
when
he
sat
in
the
sand
late
at
night
with
charlotte
the
whoop
and
bellow
of
the
that
spun
and
glittered
across
the
street
from
his
tent
the
inarticulate
breathing
and
the
clenchings
of
the
crowd
as
it
lifted
its
face
to
his
efforts
for
each
of
which
he
assumed
a
slow
painful
motion
that
exaggerated
its
difficulty
the
smell
of
the
sea
intermingled
with
a
thousand
odors
the
faint
pervasive
scent
of
charlotte
that
clung
to
him
his
clothes
his
house
the
pageant
of
the
people
always
in
a
huge
parade
going
nowhere
celebrating
nothing
but
the
functions
of
living
loud
garish
cheap
splendid
breakfasts
at
his
table
with
his
woman
voluptuousness
abated
in
the
bright
sunlight
to
little
more
than
a
reminiscence
and
a
promise
the
taste
of
beer
and
and
frankfurters
and
lobster
and
steak
the
affable
talkative
company
of
valentine
mitchel
only
once
that
he
could
recall
afterwards
did
he
allow
his
intellect
to
act
in
any
critical
direction
and
that
was
in
a
conversation
with
the
young
artist
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
sand
and
charlotte
browned
by
weeks
of
bathing
lay
near
by
here
i
am
mitchel
said
with
an
unusual
thoughtfulness
with
a
talent
that
should
be
recognized
wanting
to
be
an
illustrator
able
to
be
one
and
yet
forced
to
dawdle
with
this
horrible
business
to
make
my
living
hugo
nodded
you
come
through
some
winter
and
you
wo
ever
return
to
coney
island
i
know
it
unless
i
do
it
for
sentimental
reasons
some
day
in
a
limousine
it
myself
hugo
said
then
and
not
you
who
is
doomed
to
well
to
this
sort
of
thing
you
have
a
talent
that
is
at
least
understandable
and
he
was
going
to
say
mediocre
he
checked
himself
applicable
in
the
world
of
human
affairs
my
talent
if
it
is
a
talent
has
no
place
no
application
no
audience
mitchel
stared
at
hugo
wondering
first
what
that
talent
might
be
and
then
recognizing
that
hugo
meant
his
strength
nonsense
any
male
in
his
right
senses
would
give
all
his
wits
to
be
as
strong
as
you
are
it
was
a
polite
friendly
thing
to
say
hugo
could
not
refrain
from
comparing
himself
to
valentine
mitchel
an
artist
a
clever
artist
and
one
who
would
some
day
be
important
to
the
world
because
people
could
understand
what
he
drew
because
it
represented
a
level
of
thought
and
expression
he
was
like
hugo
in
the
doldrums
of
progress
but
mitchel
would
emerge
succeed
be
happy
or
at
least
satisfied
with
himself
while
hugo
was
bound
to
silence
was
compelled
never
to
allow
himself
full
expression
humanity
would
never
accept
and
understand
him
they
were
not
similar
people
but
their
case
was
at
that
instant
ironically
parallel
it
is
only
being
strong
he
answered
meditatively
but
it
knowing
what
to
do
with
your
strength
why
there
are
a
thousand
things
to
do
such
as
mitchel
raised
himself
on
his
elbows
and
turned
his
eyes
on
the
populous
beach
well
well
let
see
you
could
of
course
be
a
strong
man
and
amuse
people
which
you
doing
you
could
oh
there
are
lots
of
things
you
could
do
hugo
smiled
i
been
thinking
about
them
for
years
and
i
discover
any
that
are
worth
the
effort
bosh
charlotte
moved
close
to
him
there
one
thing
you
can
do
honey
and
that
enough
for
me
i
wonder
hugo
said
with
a
seriousness
the
other
two
did
not
perceive
the
increased
heat
of
august
suggested
by
its
very
intensity
a
shortness
of
duration
an
end
of
summer
hugo
began
to
wonder
what
he
would
do
with
charlotte
when
he
went
back
to
webster
he
worried
about
her
a
good
deal
and
she
guessing
the
subject
of
his
frequent
fits
of
silence
made
a
resolve
in
her
tough
and
worldly
mind
she
had
learned
more
about
certain
facets
of
hugo
than
he
knew
himself
she
realized
that
he
was
superior
to
her
and
that
in
almost
any
other
place
than
coney
island
she
would
be
a
liability
to
him
the
thought
that
he
would
have
to
desert
her
made
hugo
very
miserable
he
knew
that
he
would
miss
charlotte
and
he
knew
that
the
blow
to
her
might
spell
disaster
after
all
he
thought
he
had
not
improved
her
morals
or
raised
her
vision
he
did
not
realize
that
he
had
made
both
almost
sublime
by
the
mere
act
of
being
considerate
white
charlotte
called
it
nevertheless
she
was
not
without
an
intense
sense
of
despite
her
condition
on
the
night
he
had
found
her
she
knew
that
womankind
lived
at
the
expense
of
mankind
she
saw
the
emotional
respect
in
which
valentine
mitchel
unwittingly
held
hugo
he
had
scarcely
spoken
ten
serious
words
to
her
she
realized
that
the
artist
saw
her
as
a
property
of
his
friend
that
in
a
way
made
her
valuable
it
was
a
subtle
advantage
which
she
pressed
with
all
the
skill
it
required
one
night
when
hugo
was
at
work
and
the
chill
of
autumn
had
breathed
on
the
hot
shore
she
told
valentine
that
he
was
a
very
nice
boy
and
that
she
liked
him
very
much
he
went
away
distraught
which
was
what
she
had
intended
and
he
carried
with
him
a
new
and
as
yet
inarticulate
idea
which
was
what
she
had
foreseen
he
believed
that
he
loved
her
he
told
himself
that
hugo
was
going
to
desert
her
that
she
would
be
forsaken
and
alone
at
that
point
she
recited
to
him
the
story
of
her
life
and
the
tale
of
her
rescue
by
hugo
and
said
at
the
end
that
she
would
be
very
lonely
when
hugo
was
gone
because
hugo
had
loved
her
mitchel
thought
she
contained
depths
and
values
which
did
not
appear
that
she
contained
such
depths
neither
man
really
knew
then
both
of
them
learned
it
much
later
mitchel
found
himself
in
that
very
artistic
dilemma
of
being
in
love
with
his
mistress
it
terrified
his
romantic
soul
and
it
involved
him
inextricably
when
she
felt
that
the
situation
had
ripened
to
the
point
of
action
she
waited
for
the
precise
moment
it
came
swiftly
and
in
a
better
guise
than
she
had
hoped
on
a
night
in
early
september
when
the
crowds
had
thinned
a
little
hugo
was
just
buckling
himself
into
the
harness
that
lifted
the
horse
the
spectators
were
waiting
for
the
dénouement
with
bickering
patience
charlotte
was
standing
on
the
platform
watching
him
with
expressionless
eyes
she
knew
that
soon
she
would
not
see
hugo
any
more
she
knew
that
he
was
tired
of
his
small
show
that
he
was
chafing
to
be
gone
and
she
knew
that
his
loyalty
to
her
would
never
let
him
go
unless
it
was
made
inevitable
by
her
the
horse
was
ready
she
watched
the
muscles
start
out
beneath
hugo
tawny
skin
she
saw
his
lips
set
his
head
thrust
back
she
worshipped
him
like
that
unemotionally
she
saw
the
horse
lifted
up
from
the
floor
she
heard
the
applause
there
was
a
bustle
at
the
gate
half
a
dozen
people
entered
in
single
file
three
young
men
three
girls
they
were
intoxicated
they
laughed
and
spoke
in
loud
voices
she
saw
by
their
clothes
and
their
manner
that
they
were
rich
slumming
in
coney
island
she
smiled
at
the
young
men
as
she
had
always
smiled
at
such
young
men
friendlily
impersonally
hugo
did
not
see
their
entrance
they
came
very
near
my
god
it
hugo
danner
hugo
heard
lefty
voice
and
recognized
it
the
horse
was
dropped
to
the
floor
he
turned
an
expression
of
startled
amazement
crossed
his
features
chuck
lefty
iris
and
three
people
whom
he
did
not
know
were
staring
at
him
he
saw
the
stupefied
recognition
on
the
faces
of
his
friends
one
despairing
glance
he
cast
at
charlotte
and
then
he
went
on
with
his
act
they
waited
for
him
until
it
was
over
they
clasped
him
to
their
bosoms
they
acknowledged
charlotte
with
critical
glances
come
on
and
join
the
party
they
said
after
that
their
silence
was
worse
than
any
questions
they
talked
freely
and
merrily
enough
but
behind
their
words
was
a
deep
reserve
lefty
broke
it
when
he
had
an
opportunity
to
take
hugo
aside
what
in
hell
is
eating
you
are
you
coming
back
to
webster
sure
that
is
i
think
so
i
had
to
do
this
to
make
some
money
just
about
the
time
school
closed
my
family
went
broke
but
good
god
man
why
did
you
tell
us
my
father
is
an
alumnus
and
he
put
up
five
thousand
a
year
if
necessary
to
see
you
kept
on
the
football
team
hugo
laughed
you
do
think
i
take
it
lefty
why
not
a
pause
no
i
suppose
you
be
just
the
kind
of
a
fool
that
would
who
the
girl
hugo
did
not
falter
she
a
tart
i
been
living
with
i
never
knew
a
better
one
girl
that
is
have
you
gone
crazy
on
the
contrary
i
got
wise
well
for
christ
sake
do
say
anything
about
it
on
the
campus
hugo
bit
his
lip
do
worry
my
business
is
my
own
they
joined
the
others
drinking
at
the
table
charlotte
was
telling
a
joke
it
was
not
a
nice
joke
he
had
not
thought
of
her
jokes
before
because
iris
and
chuck
and
lefty
had
not
been
listening
to
them
now
he
was
embarrassed
iris
asked
him
to
dance
with
her
they
went
out
on
the
floor
lovely
little
thing
that
charlotte
she
said
acidly
is
she
hugo
answered
with
such
enthusiasm
that
she
did
not
speak
during
the
rest
of
the
dance
finally
the
ordeal
ended
lefty
and
his
guests
embarked
in
an
automobile
for
the
city
you
know
such
people
charlotte
hugo
cheeks
still
flamed
but
his
heart
bled
for
her
i
guess
they
are
much
he
replied
she
answered
hotly
do
you
be
like
that
they
nice
people
they
fine
people
that
iris
even
asked
me
to
her
house
gave
me
a
card
to
see
her
charlotte
could
guess
what
iris
wanted
so
could
hugo
but
charlotte
pretended
to
be
innocent
he
kissed
charlotte
and
walked
in
the
streets
until
morning
hugo
could
see
no
solution
charlotte
was
so
trusting
so
good
to
him
he
could
not
imagine
how
she
would
receive
any
suggestion
that
she
go
to
new
york
and
get
a
job
while
he
returned
to
college
that
he
see
her
during
vacations
that
he
send
money
to
her
but
he
knew
that
a
hot
fire
dwelt
within
her
and
that
her
fury
would
rise
her
grief
and
that
he
would
be
made
very
miserable
and
ashamed
she
chided
him
at
breakfast
for
his
walk
in
the
dark
she
laughed
and
kissed
him
and
pushed
him
bodily
to
his
work
he
looked
back
as
he
walked
down
to
the
curb
she
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
she
waved
her
hand
he
rounded
the
corner
with
wretched
leaden
steps
the
morning
concerned
with
the
petty
business
of
receipts
refurbishings
cleaning
went
slowly
when
he
returned
for
lunch
it
was
with
the
decision
to
tell
her
the
truth
about
his
life
and
its
requirements
and
to
let
her
decide
she
did
not
come
to
the
door
to
kiss
him
she
had
imagined
that
lonely
return
she
did
not
answer
his
brave
and
cheerful
hail
she
had
let
the
sound
of
it
ring
upon
her
ear
a
thousand
times
she
was
gone
she
knew
he
would
sit
down
and
cry
then
stumbling
he
found
the
two
notes
but
he
already
understood
the
message
from
valentine
mitchel
was
reckless
impetuous
dear
hugo
charlotte
and
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
each
other
and
i
run
away
with
her
i
almost
wish
you
come
after
us
and
kill
me
i
hate
myself
for
betraying
you
but
i
love
her
so
i
can
not
help
it
learned
to
see
in
her
what
you
first
saw
in
her
good
luck
hugo
put
it
down
charlotte
would
be
good
to
him
in
a
way
he
deserve
her
and
when
he
was
famous
some
day
perhaps
she
would
leave
him
too
he
hesitated
to
read
her
note
darling
i
do
not
love
you
any
more
it
was
ludicrous
transparent
pitiful
and
heroic
hugo
saw
all
those
qualities
darling
i
do
not
love
you
any
more
she
had
written
it
under
valentine
eyes
but
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
placate
her
new
lover
while
she
told
her
sad
little
story
to
her
old
she
would
want
him
to
feel
bad
well
god
knew
he
did
hugo
looked
at
the
room
he
sobbed
he
bolted
into
the
street
tears
streaming
down
his
cheeks
he
drew
his
savings
from
the
bank
seven
hundred
and
dollars
and
cents
he
rushed
to
the
haunted
house
flung
his
clothes
into
a
bag
he
sat
drearily
on
a
subway
for
an
hour
he
paced
the
smooth
floor
of
a
station
he
swung
aboard
a
train
he
came
to
webster
his
head
high
feeling
a
great
pride
in
charlotte
and
in
his
love
for
her
walking
in
glad
strides
over
the
familiar
soil
ix
hugo
sat
alone
and
marvelled
at
the
exquisite
torment
of
his
far
away
across
the
campus
he
heard
singing
against
the
square
segment
of
sky
visible
from
the
bay
window
of
his
room
he
could
see
the
light
of
the
great
fire
they
had
built
to
celebrate
victory
his
victory
the
light
leaped
into
the
darkness
above
like
a
great
golden
ghost
in
some
fantastic
ascension
and
beneath
it
he
knew
a
thousand
students
were
dancing
they
were
druid
priests
at
a
rite
to
the
god
of
football
his
fingers
struggled
through
his
black
hair
the
day
was
fresh
in
his
mind
the
bellowing
stands
the
taut
almost
frightened
faces
of
the
eleven
men
who
faced
him
the
smack
and
flight
of
the
brown
oval
the
lumbering
sound
of
men
running
the
sucking
of
the
breath
of
men
and
their
sharp
painful
fall
to
earth
in
his
mind
was
a
sharp
picture
of
himself
and
the
eyes
that
watched
him
as
he
broke
away
time
and
again
with
infantile
ease
to
carry
that
precious
ball
he
let
them
make
a
touchdown
that
he
could
have
averted
he
made
one
himself
then
another
the
bell
on
webster
hall
was
booming
its
pæan
of
victory
he
stiffened
under
the
steady
monody
he
remembered
again
lefty
barking
signals
with
a
strange
agony
in
his
voice
lefty
pounding
on
his
shoulder
go
in
there
hugo
and
give
it
to
them
i
ca
lefty
pleading
and
the
captain
jerry
painter
cursing
in
open
jealousy
of
hugo
vying
hopelessly
with
hugo
danner
the
man
who
was
a
god
it
was
not
fair
not
right
the
old
and
early
glory
was
ebbing
from
it
when
he
put
down
the
ball
safely
across
the
goal
for
the
winning
touchdown
he
saw
three
of
the
men
on
the
opposing
team
lie
down
and
weep
there
he
stood
pretending
to
pant
feigning
physical
distress
making
himself
a
hero
at
the
expense
of
innocent
victims
jackstraws
for
a
giant
there
was
no
triumph
in
that
he
could
not
go
on
afterwards
they
had
made
him
speak
and
the
breathless
words
that
had
once
come
so
easily
moved
heavily
through
his
mind
yet
he
had
carried
his
advantage
beyond
the
point
of
turning
back
he
could
not
say
that
the
opponents
of
webster
might
as
well
attempt
to
hold
back
a
juggernaut
to
throw
down
a
to
outrace
light
as
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
to
check
his
intent
webster
had
been
good
to
him
he
loved
webster
and
it
deserved
his
best
his
best
he
peered
again
into
the
celebrating
night
and
wondered
what
that
awful
best
would
be
he
desired
passionately
to
be
able
to
give
that
to
cover
the
earth
making
men
glad
and
bringing
a
revolution
into
their
lives
to
work
himself
into
a
fury
and
to
fatigue
his
incredible
sinews
to
end
with
the
feeling
of
a
race
well
run
a
task
nobly
executed
and
for
a
year
that
ambition
had
seemed
in
some
small
way
to
be
approaching
fruition
now
it
was
turned
to
ashes
it
was
not
with
the
muscles
of
men
that
his
goal
was
to
be
attained
they
could
not
oppose
him
as
he
sat
gloomy
and
distressed
he
wondered
for
what
reason
there
burned
in
him
that
wish
to
do
great
deeds
humanity
itself
was
too
selfish
and
too
ignorant
to
care
it
could
boil
in
its
tiny
prejudices
for
centuries
to
come
and
never
know
that
there
could
be
a
difference
moreover
who
was
he
to
grind
his
soul
and
beat
his
thoughts
for
the
benefit
of
people
who
would
never
know
and
never
care
what
honour
when
he
was
dead
to
lie
beneath
a
slab
on
which
was
punily
graven
some
note
of
mighty
accomplishment
why
could
he
not
content
himself
with
the
food
he
ate
the
sunshine
with
wind
in
trees
and
cold
water
and
a
woman
it
was
that
sad
and
silly
command
within
to
transcend
his
vegetable
self
that
made
him
human
he
tried
to
think
about
it
bitterly
fool
man
grown
suddenly
more
conscious
than
the
other
beasts
how
quickly
he
had
become
vain
because
of
it
and
how
that
vanity
led
him
forever
onward
or
was
it
vanity
when
his
aching
soul
proclaimed
that
he
would
gladly
achieve
and
die
without
other
recognition
or
acclaim
than
that
which
rose
within
himself
martyrs
were
made
of
such
stuff
and
was
not
that
perhaps
an
even
more
exaggerated
vanity
it
was
so
pitiful
to
be
a
man
and
nothing
more
hugo
bowed
his
head
and
let
his
body
tremble
with
strange
agony
perhaps
he
thought
even
the
agony
was
a
selfish
pleasure
to
him
then
he
should
be
ashamed
he
felt
shame
and
then
thought
that
the
feeling
rose
from
a
wish
for
it
and
foundered
angrily
in
the
confusion
of
his
introspection
he
knew
only
and
knew
but
dimly
that
he
would
lift
himself
up
again
and
go
on
searching
for
some
universal
foe
to
match
against
his
strength
so
pitiful
to
be
a
man
so
christ
must
have
felt
in
gethsemane
hey
hugo
yeah
what
the
hell
did
you
come
over
here
for
to
be
alone
is
that
a
hint
lefty
entered
the
room
they
want
you
over
at
the
bonfire
we
been
looking
all
over
for
you
all
right
i
go
but
honest
to
god
i
had
enough
of
this
business
for
lefty
slapped
hugo
shoulders
the
great
must
pay
for
their
celebrity
come
on
you
sap
all
right
what
the
matter
anything
the
matter
no
nothing
the
matter
only
it
sort
of
sad
to
be
hugo
checked
himself
sad
good
god
man
you
going
stale
maybe
that
it
hugo
had
a
sudden
fancy
do
you
suppose
i
could
be
let
out
of
next
week
game
what
for
my
god
hugo
pursued
the
idea
it
the
last
game
i
can
sit
on
the
lines
you
fellows
all
play
good
ball
you
can
probably
win
if
you
ca
then
i
play
if
you
only
knew
lefty
how
tired
i
get
sometimes
tired
why
do
you
say
something
about
it
you
can
lay
off
practice
for
three
or
four
days
not
that
tired
in
the
head
not
the
body
tired
of
crashing
through
and
always
getting
away
with
it
oh
i
not
conceited
but
i
know
they
ca
stop
me
you
know
it
it
a
gift
of
mine
and
a
curse
how
about
it
let
start
next
week
without
me
the
night
ended
at
last
a
new
day
came
the
bell
on
webster
hall
stopped
booming
woodie
the
coach
came
to
see
hugo
between
classes
lefty
says
you
want
us
to
start
without
you
next
week
what
the
big
idea
i
do
know
i
thought
the
other
birds
would
like
a
shot
at
yale
without
me
they
can
do
it
woodman
eyed
his
player
that
pretty
generous
of
you
hugo
is
there
any
other
reason
not
that
i
can
explain
i
see
the
coach
offered
hugo
a
cigarette
after
he
had
helped
himself
take
it
it
do
you
good
thanks
listen
hugo
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
but
first
i
want
you
to
promise
you
give
me
a
plain
answer
i
try
that
wo
do
well
i
ca
promise
woodman
sighed
i
ask
it
anyway
you
can
answer
or
not
just
as
you
wish
he
was
silent
he
inhaled
his
cigarette
and
blew
the
smoke
through
his
nostrils
his
eyes
rested
on
hugo
with
an
expression
of
intense
interest
beneath
which
was
a
softer
light
of
something
not
unlike
sympathy
i
have
to
tell
you
something
first
hugo
when
you
went
away
last
summer
i
took
a
trip
to
colorado
hugo
started
and
woodman
continued
to
indian
creek
i
met
your
father
and
your
mother
i
told
them
that
i
knew
you
i
did
my
best
to
gain
their
confidence
you
see
hugo
i
watched
you
with
a
more
skilful
eye
than
most
people
i
seen
you
do
things
a
few
little
things
that
were
well
that
were
hugo
throat
was
dry
natural
that
the
best
word
i
guess
you
were
never
like
my
other
boys
in
any
case
so
i
thought
i
find
out
what
i
could
i
must
admit
that
my
efforts
with
your
father
were
a
failure
aside
from
the
fact
that
he
is
an
able
biology
teacher
and
that
he
had
a
number
of
queer
theories
years
ago
i
learned
nothing
but
i
did
find
out
what
those
theories
were
do
you
want
me
to
stop
a
peculiar
almost
hopeful
expression
was
on
hugo
face
no
he
answered
well
they
had
to
do
with
the
biochemistry
of
cellular
structure
did
they
and
with
the
production
of
energy
in
cells
and
then
i
talked
to
lots
of
people
i
heard
about
samson
samson
hugo
echoed
as
if
the
dead
had
spoken
samson
the
cat
hugo
was
as
pale
as
chalk
his
eyes
burned
darkly
he
felt
that
his
universe
was
slipping
from
beneath
him
you
know
then
he
said
i
do
know
hugo
i
merely
guessed
i
was
going
to
ask
now
i
shall
not
perhaps
i
do
know
but
i
had
another
question
son
yes
hugo
looked
at
woodman
and
felt
then
the
reason
for
his
success
as
a
coach
as
a
leader
and
master
of
youth
he
understood
it
well
i
wondered
if
you
thought
it
was
worth
while
to
talk
to
your
father
and
discover
what
he
did
hugo
suggested
hoarsely
woodman
put
his
hand
on
hugo
knee
what
he
did
son
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
what
it
means
i
been
watching
you
i
do
want
your
head
to
swell
but
you
a
great
boy
hugo
not
only
in
beef
you
have
a
brain
and
an
imagination
and
a
sense
of
moral
responsibility
you
come
out
better
than
the
rest
you
would
even
without
your
your
particular
talent
and
i
thought
you
might
think
that
the
rest
of
humanity
would
profit
hugo
jumped
to
his
feet
no
a
thousand
times
no
for
the
love
of
christ
no
you
do
know
or
understand
you
ca
conceive
woodie
what
it
means
to
have
it
you
do
have
the
faintest
idea
of
its
amount
what
it
tempts
you
with
what
they
did
to
me
and
i
did
to
myself
to
beat
it
if
i
have
beaten
it
he
laughed
listen
woodie
anything
i
want
is
mine
anything
i
desire
i
can
take
no
one
can
hinder
and
sometimes
i
sweat
all
night
for
fear
some
day
i
shall
lose
my
temper
there
a
desire
in
me
to
break
and
destroy
and
wreck
that
oh
hell
woodman
waited
then
he
spoke
quietly
you
sure
hugo
that
the
desire
to
be
the
only
one
like
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
hugo
sole
response
was
to
look
into
woodman
eyes
a
look
so
pregnant
with
meaning
so
tortured
so
humble
that
the
coach
swore
softly
then
he
held
out
his
hand
well
hugo
that
all
you
been
damn
swell
about
it
the
way
i
hoped
you
would
be
and
i
think
my
answer
is
plain
one
thing
as
long
as
i
live
i
promise
on
my
oath
i
never
give
you
away
or
support
any
rumour
that
hurts
your
secret
even
hugo
was
stirred
to
a
consciousness
of
the
strength
of
the
other
man
grip
saturday
a
shrill
whistle
the
thump
of
leather
against
leather
the
roar
of
the
stadium
hugo
leaned
forward
he
watched
his
fellows
from
the
bench
they
rushed
across
the
field
lefty
caught
the
ball
eddie
carter
interfered
with
the
first
man
bimbo
gaines
with
the
second
the
third
slammed
lefty
against
the
earth
three
downs
eight
yards
a
kick
new
haven
brought
the
ball
to
its
line
the
men
in
helmets
formed
again
a
coughing
voice
pandemonium
again
in
line
the
voice
the
riot
of
figures
suddenly
still
again
a
kick
lefty
with
the
ball
and
bimbo
gaines
leading
him
his
big
body
a
shield
down
a
break
and
a
run
for
yards
must
have
been
chuck
good
old
chuck
he
be
playing
the
game
of
his
life
graduation
next
spring
four
seven
eleven
hugo
anticipated
the
spreading
of
the
players
he
looked
where
the
ball
would
be
thrown
he
watched
minton
the
end
spring
forward
saw
him
falter
saw
the
opposing
quarterback
run
in
saw
lefty
thrown
saw
the
ball
received
by
the
enemy
and
moved
up
saw
the
opposing
back
spilled
nastily
his
heart
beat
faster
no
score
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
the
third
quarter
witnessed
the
crossing
of
webster
goal
struggling
grimly
gamely
against
a
team
that
was
their
superior
without
hugo
against
a
team
heartened
by
the
knowledge
that
hugo
was
not
facing
it
webster
players
were
being
beaten
the
goal
was
not
kicked
it
made
the
score
six
to
nothing
against
webster
hugo
saw
the
captain
rip
off
his
headgear
and
throw
it
angrily
on
the
ground
he
understood
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
minds
of
his
team
in
a
clear
although
remote
way
they
went
out
to
show
that
they
could
play
the
game
without
hugo
danner
and
they
were
not
showing
what
they
had
hoped
to
show
a
few
minutes
later
their
opponents
made
a
second
touchdown
thirteen
to
nothing
woodman
moved
beside
hugo
they
ca
do
it
and
i
do
altogether
blame
them
they
depended
on
you
too
much
it
too
bad
we
all
have
hugo
nodded
shall
i
go
in
the
coach
watched
the
next
play
i
guess
you
better
when
hugo
entered
the
line
jerry
painter
and
lefty
spoke
to
him
in
strained
tones
you
got
to
take
it
over
hugo
all
the
way
all
right
the
men
lined
up
a
tense
silence
had
fallen
on
the
yale
line
they
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
the
signals
were
called
the
ball
shot
back
to
lefty
hugo
began
to
run
the
men
in
front
rushed
together
and
lefty
stuffed
the
ball
into
hugo
arms
go
on
he
shouted
the
touchdown
was
made
in
one
play
hugo
saw
a
narrow
hole
and
scooted
into
it
a
man
met
his
outstretched
arm
on
the
other
side
another
hugo
dodged
twice
the
crescendo
roar
of
the
webster
section
came
to
him
dimly
he
avoided
the
safety
man
and
ran
to
the
goal
in
the
pandemonium
afterwards
jerry
kicked
the
goal
a
new
hugo
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
got
ta
break
this
up
hugo
broke
it
up
he
held
yale
almost
they
kicked
back
hugo
returned
the
kick
to
the
middle
of
the
field
he
did
not
dare
to
do
more
then
he
stood
in
his
leather
helmet
bent
alert
waiting
to
run
again
they
called
the
captain
signal
he
made
four
yards
then
lefty
he
made
a
first
down
then
jerry
two
yards
six
yards
five
yards
another
first
down
the
stands
were
insane
hugo
was
glad
they
were
not
using
him
glad
until
he
saw
jerry
painter
face
it
was
pale
with
rage
blood
trickled
across
it
from
a
small
cut
three
tries
failed
hugo
spoke
to
him
i
take
it
over
jerry
if
you
say
so
jerry
doubled
his
fist
and
would
have
struck
him
if
hugo
had
not
stepped
back
god
damn
you
danner
you
come
out
here
in
the
last
few
minutes
all
fresh
and
make
us
look
like
a
lot
of
fools
i
tell
you
my
team
and
i
will
take
that
ball
across
and
not
you
with
your
bastard
tricks
but
good
god
man
you
heard
me
this
is
your
last
down
there
was
time
for
nothing
more
lefty
called
jerry
signal
and
jerry
failed
the
other
team
took
the
ball
rushed
it
twice
and
kicked
back
into
the
webster
territory
again
the
tired
dogged
players
began
a
march
forward
the
ball
was
not
given
to
hugo
he
did
his
best
using
his
body
as
a
ram
to
open
holes
in
the
line
tripping
tacklers
with
his
body
fighting
within
the
limits
of
an
appearance
of
human
strength
to
get
his
teammates
through
to
victory
and
jerry
still
pale
and
profane
drove
the
men
like
slaves
it
was
useless
if
hugo
had
dared
more
they
might
have
succeeded
but
they
lost
the
ball
again
it
was
only
in
the
last
few
seconds
that
an
exhausted
and
victorious
team
relinquished
the
ball
to
webster
jerry
ordered
his
own
number
again
hugo
cold
and
somewhat
furious
at
the
vanity
and
injustice
of
the
performance
gritted
his
teeth
how
about
letting
me
try
jerry
i
can
make
it
it
for
webster
not
for
you
you
go
to
hell
lefty
said
you
out
of
your
head
jerry
i
said
i
take
it
for
one
instant
hugo
looked
into
his
eyes
and
in
that
instant
the
captain
saw
a
dark
and
flickering
fury
that
filled
him
with
fear
the
whistle
blew
and
then
hugo
to
his
astonishment
heard
his
signal
lefty
was
disobeying
the
captain
he
felt
the
ball
in
his
arms
he
ran
smoothly
suddenly
he
saw
a
dark
shadow
in
the
air
the
captain
hit
him
on
the
jaw
with
all
his
strength
after
that
hugo
did
not
think
lucidly
he
was
momentarily
berserk
he
ran
into
the
line
raging
and
upset
it
like
a
row
of
tenpins
he
raced
into
the
open
a
single
man
thirty
yards
away
stood
between
him
and
the
goal
the
man
drew
near
in
an
instant
hugo
doubled
his
arm
to
slug
him
he
felt
the
arm
straighten
relented
too
late
and
heard
above
the
chaos
that
was
loose
a
sudden
dreadful
snap
the
man
head
flew
back
and
he
dropped
hugo
ran
across
the
goal
the
gun
stopped
the
game
but
before
the
avalanche
fell
upon
him
hugo
saw
his
victim
lying
motionless
on
the
field
what
followed
was
nightmare
the
singing
and
the
cheering
the
parade
the
smashing
of
the
goal
posts
the
gradual
descent
of
silence
a
pause
a
shudder
he
realized
that
he
had
been
let
down
from
the
shoulders
of
the
students
he
saw
woodman
waving
his
hands
his
face
a
graven
mask
the
men
met
in
the
midst
of
that
turbulence
you
killed
him
hugo
the
earth
spun
and
rocked
slowly
he
was
paying
his
first
price
for
losing
his
temper
killed
him
his
neck
was
three
places
some
of
the
others
heard
they
walked
away
presently
hugo
was
standing
alone
on
the
cinders
outside
the
stadium
lefty
came
up
i
just
heard
about
it
tough
luck
but
do
let
it
break
you
hugo
did
not
answer
he
knew
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
sort
of
murder
in
his
own
eyes
it
was
murder
he
had
given
away
for
one
red
moment
to
the
leaping
lusting
urge
to
smash
the
world
and
killed
a
man
they
would
never
accuse
him
they
would
never
talk
about
it
only
woodman
perhaps
would
guess
the
thing
behind
the
murder
the
demon
inside
hugo
that
was
tame
except
then
when
his
captain
in
jealous
and
inferior
rage
had
struck
him
it
was
night
out
of
deference
to
the
body
of
the
boy
lying
in
the
webster
chapel
there
was
no
celebration
every
ounce
of
glory
and
joy
had
been
drained
from
the
victory
the
students
left
hugo
to
a
solitude
that
was
more
awful
than
a
thousand
scornful
tongues
they
thought
he
would
feel
as
they
would
feel
about
such
an
accident
they
gave
him
respect
when
he
needed
counsel
as
he
sat
by
himself
he
thought
that
he
should
tell
them
the
truth
all
of
them
confess
a
crime
and
accept
the
punishment
hours
passed
at
midnight
woodman
called
there
is
much
to
say
hugo
i
sorry
you
sorry
we
all
sorry
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
do
something
foolish
tell
these
people
all
about
it
for
example
i
was
going
to
do
they
never
understand
you
be
involved
in
a
legal
war
that
would
undoubtedly
end
in
your
acquittal
but
it
would
drag
in
all
your
friends
and
your
mother
and
father
particularly
him
the
papers
would
go
wild
you
might
on
the
other
hand
be
executed
as
a
menace
you
ca
tell
it
might
be
a
good
thing
hugo
answered
bitterly
do
let
me
hear
you
say
that
you
fool
i
tell
you
hugo
if
you
go
into
that
business
i
get
up
on
the
stand
and
say
i
knew
it
all
the
time
and
i
let
a
man
play
on
my
team
when
i
was
pretty
sure
that
sooner
or
later
he
kill
someone
then
i
go
to
jail
surely
you
a
pretty
fine
man
mr
woodman
hell
what
shall
i
do
hugo
voice
trembled
he
suffered
as
he
had
not
dreamed
it
was
possible
to
suffer
that
up
to
you
i
say
live
it
down
live
it
down
do
you
know
what
that
means
in
a
college
yes
i
think
i
do
hugo
you
can
live
down
almost
anything
except
that
one
thing
murder
too
ugly
woodie
maybe
maybe
you
got
to
decide
son
if
you
decide
against
trying
and
mind
you
you
might
be
justified
i
got
a
who
has
a
ranch
in
alberta
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
from
any
place
you
be
welcome
there
hugo
did
not
reply
he
took
the
coach
hand
and
wrung
it
then
for
an
hour
the
two
men
sat
side
by
side
in
the
darkness
at
last
woodman
rose
and
left
he
said
only
remember
that
offer
it
cold
and
bleak
and
the
work
is
hard
hugo
woodie
thanks
for
coming
up
when
the
campus
was
still
with
the
quiet
of
sleep
hugo
crossed
it
as
swiftly
as
a
spectre
all
night
he
strode
remorselessly
over
country
roads
his
face
was
set
his
eyes
burned
he
ignored
the
trembling
of
his
joints
when
the
sky
faded
he
went
back
he
packed
his
clothes
in
two
with
them
swinging
at
his
side
he
stole
out
of
the
psi
delta
house
crossed
the
campus
stopped
for
a
long
instant
he
stared
at
webster
hall
the
first
light
of
morning
was
just
touching
it
the
débris
collected
for
a
fire
that
was
never
lighted
was
strewn
around
the
cannon
he
saw
the
initials
he
had
painted
there
a
year
and
more
ago
still
faintly
legible
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
webster
he
said
he
lifted
the
suitcase
and
vanished
in
a
few
minutes
the
campus
was
five
miles
behind
him
six
ten
twenty
when
he
saw
the
first
early
caravan
of
produce
headed
toward
the
market
he
slowed
to
a
walk
the
sun
came
over
a
hill
and
sparkled
on
a
billion
drops
of
dew
a
bird
flew
singing
from
his
path
hugo
danner
had
fled
beyond
the
gates
of
webster
x
a
year
passed
in
the
harbour
of
cristobal
at
the
northern
end
of
the
locks
waiting
for
the
day
to
open
the
great
steel
jaws
that
dammed
the
pacific
from
the
atlantic
the
pulled
at
her
anchor
chain
in
the
gentle
swell
a
few
stars
liquid
bright
hung
in
the
tropical
sky
a
little
puff
of
wind
coming
occasionally
from
the
south
carried
the
smell
of
the
jungle
to
the
ship
the
crew
was
awakening
a
man
with
a
bucket
on
a
rope
went
to
the
rail
and
hauled
up
a
brimming
pail
from
the
warm
sea
he
splashed
his
face
and
hands
into
it
then
he
poured
it
back
and
repeated
the
act
of
dipping
up
water
hey
he
said
another
man
joined
him
here
swab
off
your
sweat
look
yonder
the
dorsal
fin
of
a
shark
rippled
momentarily
on
the
surface
and
dipped
beneath
it
a
third
man
appeared
he
accepted
the
proffered
water
and
washed
himself
his
roving
eye
saw
the
shark
as
it
rose
for
the
second
time
he
dried
on
a
towel
the
breeze
stirred
his
dark
hair
there
was
a
growth
of
equally
dark
beard
on
his
tanned
jaw
and
cheek
steely
muscles
bulged
under
his
shirt
his
forearm
when
he
picked
up
the
pail
was
corded
like
cable
a
smell
of
coffee
issued
from
the
galley
and
the
smoke
of
the
cook
fire
was
wafted
on
deck
for
a
pungent
moment
two
bells
sounded
the
music
went
out
over
the
water
in
clear
humming
waves
the
man
who
had
come
first
from
the
forecastle
leaned
his
buttocks
against
the
rail
one
end
of
it
had
been
unhooked
to
permit
the
discharge
of
mail
the
rail
ran
the
man
fell
back
clawing
and
then
thinking
suddenly
of
the
sharks
he
screamed
the
third
man
looked
he
saw
his
go
overboard
he
jumped
from
where
he
stood
clearing
the
scuppers
and
falling
through
the
air
before
the
victim
of
the
slack
rail
had
landed
in
the
water
the
two
splashes
were
almost
simultaneous
a
boatswain
hearing
the
cry
hastened
to
the
scene
he
saw
one
man
lifted
clear
of
the
water
by
the
other
who
was
treading
water
furiously
he
shouted
for
a
rope
he
saw
the
curve
and
dip
of
a
fin
the
first
man
seized
the
rope
and
climbed
and
was
pulled
up
the
second
his
rescuer
dived
under
water
as
if
aware
of
something
there
that
required
his
attention
the
men
above
him
could
not
know
that
he
had
felt
the
rake
of
teeth
across
his
leg
powerful
teeth
which
nevertheless
did
not
penetrate
his
skin
as
he
dived
into
the
green
depths
he
saw
a
body
lunge
toward
him
turn
yawn
a
mouth
he
snatched
the
lower
jaw
in
one
hand
and
the
upper
in
the
other
he
exerted
his
strength
the
mouth
gaped
wider
a
tail
twelve
feet
behind
it
lashed
the
thing
died
with
fingers
like
steel
claws
tearing
at
its
brain
it
floated
belly
up
the
man
rose
took
the
rope
climbed
aboard
other
sharks
assaulted
the
dead
one
the
dripping
sailor
clasped
his
saviour
hand
god
almighty
man
you
saved
my
life
jesus
that
four
hugo
danner
said
abstractedly
and
then
he
smiled
all
right
forget
it
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
sharks
he
had
never
seen
one
before
in
his
life
he
walked
aft
where
the
men
grouped
around
him
how
you
do
it
it
a
trick
i
ca
explain
very
well
hugo
said
you
use
their
rush
to
break
their
jaws
it
takes
a
good
deal
of
muscle
anyway
guy
thanks

a
whistle

the

up
in

for

loomed
in
the
feeble
sun
of

edged

at

speed
the
sea
blue
green
restless
driven
in
empty
quarters
by
devils
riding

secretive

making

gigantic
primeval

the
came
to
the
islands
in
the
south
pacific
islands
that
issued
from
the
water
like
green
wreaths
and
seemed
to
float
on
it
the
small
boats
were
put
out
and
sections
of
the
cargo
were
sent
to
rickety
wharves
where
white
men
and
brown
islanders
took
charge
of
it
and
carried
it
away
into
the
fringe
of
the
lush
vegetation
hugo
looking
at
those
islands
was
moved
to
smile
the
place
where
broken
men
hid
from
civilization
where
the
derelicts
of
the
world
gathered
to
drown
their
shame
in
a
verdant
paradise
that
had
no
particular
position
in
the
white
man
scheme
of
the
earth
at
one
of
the
smaller
islands
an
accident
to
the
engine
forced
the
to
linger
for
two
weeks
it
was
during
those
two
weeks
in
a
rather
extraordinary
manner
that
hugo
danner
laid
the
first
foundation
of
the
fortune
that
he
accumulated
in
his
later
life
one
day
idling
away
a
leave
on
shore
in
the
shade
of
a
mighty
tree
he
saw
the
outriggers
of
the
natives
file
away
for
the
oyster
beds
and
out
of
pure
curiosity
he
followed
them
for
a
whole
day
he
watched
the
men
plunge
under
the
surface
in
search
of
pearls
the
next
day
he
came
back
and
dove
with
one
of
them
on
the
bizarre
floor
of
the
ocean
among
the
colossal
fronds
of
its
flora
the
two
men
swam
they
were
invaders
from
the
brilliance
above
the
surface
shooting
like
fish
horizontally
through
the
murk
and
shadow
and
the
denizens
of
that
world
resented
their
coming
great
fish
shot
past
them
with
malevolent
eyes
and
the
vises
of
giant
clams
shut
swiftly
in
attempts
to
trap
their
moving
limbs
hugo
was
entranced
he
watched
the
other
man
as
he
found
the
oyster
bed
and
commenced
to
fill
his
basket
with
frantic
haste
when
his
lungs
stung
and
he
could
bear
the
agony
no
longer
he
turned
and
forged
toward
the
upper
air
then
they
went
down
again
hugo
blood
designed
to
take
more
oxygen
from
the
air
and
his
greater
density
fitted
him
naturally
for
the
work
the
pressure
did
not
make
him
suffer
and
the
few
moments
granted
to
the
divers
beneath
the
forbidding
element
stretched
to
a
longer
time
for
him
on
the
second
day
of
diving
he
went
alone
his
amateur
attempt
had
been
surprisingly
fruitful
standing
erect
in
the
immense
solitude
he
searched
the
hills
and
valleys
at
length
finding
a
promising
cluster
of
shellfish
he
began
to
examine
them
one
by
one
pulling
them
loose
feeling
in
their
pulpy
interior
for
the
precious
jewels
he
occupied
himself
determinedly
while
the
was
waiting
in
apia
and
at
the
end
of
the
stay
he
had
collected
more
than
sixty
pearls
of
great
value
and
two
hundred
of
moderate
worth
it
was
he
thought
typical
of
himself
he
had
decided
to
make
a
fortune
of
some
sort
after
the
first
bitter
rage
over
his
debacle
at
webster
had
abated
in
his
heart
he
realized
that
without
wealth
his
position
in
the
world
would
be
more
difficult
and
more
futile
than
his
fates
had
decreed
poverty
at
least
he
was
not
forced
to
bear
he
could
wrest
fortune
from
nature
by
his
might
that
he
had
begun
that
task
by
diving
for
pearls
fitted
into
his
scheme
it
was
such
a
method
as
no
other
man
would
have
considered
and
its
achievement
robbed
no
one
while
it
enriched
him
when
the
turned
her
prow
westward
again
hugo
worked
with
his
shipmates
in
a
mood
that
had
undergone
considerable
change
there
was
no
more
despair
in
him
little
of
the
taciturnity
that
had
marked
his
earliest
days
at
sea
none
of
the
hatred
of
mankind
he
had
buried
that
slowly
and
carefully
in
a
dull
year
of
work
ashore
and
a
month
of
toil
on
the
heaving
deck
of
the
ship
for
six
months
he
had
kept
himself
alive
in
a
manner
that
he
could
scarcely
remember
driving
a
truck
working
on
a
farm
digging
in
a
road
his
mind
a
bitter
blank
his
valiant
dreams
all
dead
one
day
he
had
saved
a
man
life
the
reaction
to
that
was
small
but
it
was
definite
the
strength
that
could
slay
was
also
a
strength
that
could
succour
he
had
repeated
the
act
some
time
later
he
felt
it
was
a
kind
of
atonement
after
that
he
sought
deliberately
to
go
where
he
might
be
of
assistance
in
the
city
again
in
september
when
a
fire
engine
clanged
and
whooped
through
the
streets
he
followed
and
carried
a
woman
from
a
blazing
roof
as
if
by
a
miracle
then
the
seaman
he
had
counted
four
rescues
by
that
time
perhaps
his
for
the
boy
who
had
fallen
on
the
field
at
webster
could
be
stifled
eventually
human
life
seemed
very
precious
to
hugo
then
he
sold
his
pearls
when
the
ship
touched
at
large
cities
a
handful
here
and
a
dozen
there
bargaining
carefully
and
forwarding
the
profit
to
a
bank
in
new
york
he
might
have
continued
that
voyage
which
was
a
voyage
commenced
half
in
new
recognition
of
his
old
wish
to
see
and
know
the
world
and
half
in
the
quest
of
forgetfulness
but
a
slip
and
shifts
in
the
history
of
the
world
put
an
abrupt
end
to
it
when
the
rounded
the
bec
and
steamed
into
the
blue
and
cocoa
harbour
of
marseilles
hugo
heard
that
war
had
been
declared
by
germany
austria
france
russia
england
xi
in
a
day
the
last
veil
of
mist
that
had
shrouded
his
feelings
and
thoughts
making
them
numb
and
sterile
vanished
in
a
day
hugo
found
himself
or
believed
that
he
had
in
a
day
his
life
changed
and
flung
itself
on
the
course
which
in
a
measure
destined
its
fixation
he
never
forgot
that
day
it
began
in
the
early
morning
when
the
anchor
of
the
freighter
thundered
into
the
harbour
water
the
crew
was
not
given
shore
leave
until
noon
then
the
mysterious
silence
of
the
captain
and
the
change
in
the
course
was
explained
through
the
third
officer
he
sent
a
message
to
the
seamen
war
had
been
declared
the
seaways
were
unsafe
the
would
remain
indefinitely
at
marseilles
the
men
could
go
ashore
they
would
report
on
the
following
day
the
first
announcement
of
the
word
sent
hugo
blood
racing
war
what
war
with
whom
why
was
america
in
it
or
interested
in
it
he
stepped
ashore
and
hurried
into
the
city
the
populace
was
in
feverish
excitement
soldiers
were
everywhere
as
if
they
had
sprung
up
magically
like
the
seed
of
the
dragon
hugo
walked
through
street
after
street
in
the
furious
heat
he
bought
a
paper
and
read
the
french
accounts
of
mobilizations
of
a
battle
impending
he
looked
everywhere
for
some
one
who
could
tell
him
twice
he
approached
the
american
consulate
but
it
was
jammed
with
frantic
and
frightened
people
who
were
trying
only
to
get
away
hugo
ambition
growing
in
him
like
a
fire
was
in
the
opposite
direction
war
and
he
was
hugo
danner
he
sat
at
a
café
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
was
so
excited
by
the
contagion
in
his
veins
that
he
scarcely
thrilled
at
the
first
use
of
his
new
and
tongue
the
hurried
to
his
table
la
hugo
said
the
waiter
asked
a
question
which
hugo
could
not
understand
so
he
repeated
his
order
in
the
universal
language
of
measurement
of
a
large
glass
by
his
hands
the
waiter
nodded
hugo
took
his
beer
and
stared
out
at
the
people
they
hurried
along
the
sidewalk
brushing
the
table
at
which
he
sat
they
called
to
each
other
laughed
cried
sometimes
and
shook
hands
over
and
over
was
on
every
tongue
old
men
gestured
the
directions
of
battles
young
men
a
little
more
serious
perhaps
and
often
very
drunk
were
rushing
into
uniform
as
order
followed
order
for
mobilization
and
there
were
girls
thousands
of
them
walking
with
the
young
men
hugo
wanted
to
be
in
it
he
was
startled
by
the
impact
of
that
desire
all
the
ferocity
of
him
all
the
unleashed
wish
to
rend
and
kill
was
blazing
in
his
soul
but
it
was
a
subtle
conflagration
which
urged
him
in
terms
of
duty
in
words
that
spoke
of
the
war
as
his
one
perfect
opportunity
to
put
himself
to
a
use
worthy
of
his
gift
a
war
in
a
war
what
would
hold
him
what
would
be
superior
to
him
who
could
resist
him
he
swallowed
glass
after
glass
of
the
brackish
beer
quenching
a
mighty
thirst
and
firing
a
mightier
ambition
he
saw
himself
charging
into
battle
fighting
till
his
ammunition
was
gone
till
his
bayonet
broke
and
then
turning
like
a
titan
and
doing
monster
deeds
with
bare
hands
and
teeth
bands
played
and
feet
marched
his
blood
rose
to
a
a
frenchman
flung
himself
at
hugo
table
and
you
why
are
you
a
soldier
i
will
be
hugo
replied
bravo
we
shall
revenge
ourselves
the
man
gulped
a
glass
of
wine
slapped
hugo
shoulder
and
was
gone
then
a
girl
talked
to
hugo
then
another
man
hugo
dwelt
on
the
politics
of
the
war
and
its
sociology
only
in
the
most
perfunctory
manner
it
was
time
the
imperialistic
ambitions
of
the
central
powers
were
ended
a
war
was
inevitable
for
that
purpose
france
and
england
had
been
attacked
they
were
defending
themselves
he
would
assist
them
even
the
problem
of
citizenship
and
the
tangle
of
red
tape
his
enlistment
might
involve
did
not
impress
him
he
could
see
the
field
of
battle
and
hear
the
roar
of
guns
a
picture
conjured
up
by
his
knowledge
of
the
old
wars
what
a
soldier
he
would
be
while
his
mind
was
still
leaping
and
throbbing
and
his
head
was
whirling
darkness
descended
he
would
give
away
his
life
do
his
duty
and
a
hundred
times
more
than
his
duty
here
was
the
thing
that
was
intended
for
him
the
weapon
forged
for
his
hand
the
task
designed
for
his
undertaking
war
in
war
he
could
bring
to
a
full
fruition
the
majesty
of
his
strength
no
need
to
fear
it
there
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
it
he
felt
himself
almost
the
messiah
of
war
the
man
created
at
the
precise
instant
he
was
required
his
call
to
serve
was
sounding
in
his
ears
and
the
bands
played
the
chaos
did
not
diminish
at
night
but
rather
it
increased
he
went
with
milling
crowds
to
a
bulletin
board
the
germans
had
commenced
to
move
they
had
entered
belgium
in
violation
of
treaties
long
held
sacred
belgium
was
resisting
and
liége
was
shaking
at
the
devastation
of
the
great
howitzers
a
terrible
crime
hugo
shook
with
the
rage
of
the
crowd
the
first
outrages
and
violations
highly
magnified
were
reported
the
blond
beast
would
have
to
be
broken
god
damn
a
voice
drawled
at
hugo
side
he
turned
a
tall
lean
man
stood
there
a
man
who
was
unquestionably
american
hugo
spoke
in
instant
excitement
there
sure
is
hell
to
pay
the
man
turned
his
head
and
saw
hugo
he
stared
at
him
rather
superciliously
at
his
slightly
seedy
clothes
and
his
strong
unusual
face
american
yeah
let
have
a
drink
they
separated
themselves
from
the
mob
and
went
to
a
crowded
café
the
man
sat
down
and
hugo
took
a
chair
at
his
side
as
you
put
it
the
man
said
there
is
hell
to
pay
let
drink
on
the
payment
hugo
felt
in
him
a
certain
aloofness
a
detachment
that
checked
his
desire
to
throw
himself
into
flamboyant
conversation
my
danner
he
said
mine
shayne
thomas
mathew
shayne
i
from
new
york
so
am
i
in
a
way
i
was
on
a
ship
that
was
stranded
here
by
the
war
at
loose
ends
now
shayne
nodded
he
was
not
particularly
friendly
for
a
person
who
had
met
a
countryman
in
a
strange
city
hugo
did
not
realize
that
shayne
had
been
besieged
all
day
by
distant
acquaintances
and
total
strangers
for
assistance
in
leaving
france
or
that
he
expected
a
request
for
money
from
hugo
momentarily
and
shayne
did
not
seem
particularly
wrought
up
by
the
condition
of
war
they
lifted
their
glasses
and
drank
hugo
lost
a
little
of
his
ardour
nice
mess
time
though
time
the
germans
got
their
answer
shayne
haughty
eyebrows
lifted
his
wide
thin
mouth
smiled
perhaps
i
just
came
from
germany
seemed
like
a
nice
peaceful
country
three
weeks
ago
oh
hugo
wondered
if
there
were
many
americans
his
companion
answered
the
thought
not
that
i
do
believe
the
germans
are
wrong
but
war
is
such
such
a
damn
fool
thing
well
it
ca
be
helped
no
it
ca
we
all
going
to
go
out
and
get
killed
though
we
sure
america
will
get
in
it
that
part
of
the
game
america
is
more
dangerous
to
germany
than
france
or
england
for
that
matter
that
a
rather
viewpoint
shayne
nodded
i
been
raised
on
it
vous
he
reached
for
his
pocketbook
simultaneously
with
hugo
sorry
you
stranded
he
said
and
if
a
hundred
francs
will
help
i
be
glad
to
let
you
have
it
i
ca
do
more
hugo
jaw
dropped
he
laughed
a
little
good
lord
man
i
said
my
ship
was
stuck
not
me
and
these
drinks
are
mine
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
withdrew
a
huge
roll
of
american
bills
and
a
packet
of
french
notes
shayne
hesitated
his
calmness
was
not
severely
shaken
however
sorry
old
man
you
see
all
day
i
been
fighting
off
starving
and
startled
americans
and
i
thought
you
were
one
i
apologize
for
my
mistake
he
looked
at
hugo
with
more
interest
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
a
little
skittish
about
patriotism
and
about
war
of
course
going
to
be
in
it
the
first
entertaining
thing
that
has
happened
in
a
dog
age
but
i
a
conscientious
objector
on
principles
i
rather
thought
i
enlist
in
the
foreign
legion
he
was
an
unfamiliar
type
to
hugo
he
represented
the
american
who
had
been
educated
at
home
and
abroad
who
had
acquired
a
wide
horizon
for
his
views
who
was
bored
with
the
routine
of
his
existence
his
clothes
were
elegant
and
impeccable
his
face
was
very
nearly
inscrutable
although
he
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
hugo
he
made
the
latter
feel
youthful
they
had
a
brace
of
drinks
two
more
and
two
more
all
about
them
was
bedlam
as
if
the
emotions
of
man
had
suddenly
been
let
loose
to
sweep
him
off
his
feet
grief
joy
rage
lust
fear
were
all
obviously
there
in
almost
equal
proportions
shayne
extended
his
hand
they
have
something
to
fight
for
at
least
something
besides
money
and
glory
a
grudge
i
wonder
what
it
is
that
makes
me
want
to
get
in
i
do
so
do
i
shayne
shook
his
head
i
would
if
i
were
you
still
you
will
probably
be
compelled
to
in
a
while
he
looked
at
his
watch
do
you
care
to
take
dinner
with
me
i
had
an
engagement
with
an
aunt
who
is
on
the
verge
of
apoplexy
because
two
of
the
boston
shaynes
are
in
munich
it
scarcely
seems
appropriate
at
the
moment
i
detest
her
anyway
what
do
you
say
i
like
to
have
dinner
with
you
they
walked
down
the
cannebière
at
a
restaurant
on
the
east
side
near
the
foot
of
the
thoroughfare
they
found
a
table
in
the
corner
a
pair
of
waiters
hastened
to
take
their
order
the
place
was
riotous
with
voices
and
the
musical
sounds
of
dining
on
a
special
table
was
a
great
demijohn
of
cognac
which
was
fast
being
drained
by
the
guests
shayne
consulted
with
his
companion
and
then
ordered
in
fluent
french
the
meal
that
was
brought
approached
a
perfection
of
service
and
a
superiority
of
cooking
that
hugo
had
never
experienced
and
always
the
babble
the
blare
of
bands
the
swelling
and
fading
persistence
of
the
stringed
orchestra
the
stream
of
purple
châteauneuf
du
pape
and
its
flinty
taste
the
glitter
of
the
lights
and
the
bright
colours
on
the
mosaics
that
represented
the
principal
cities
of
europe
it
was
a
splendid
meal
i
afraid
i
have
to
ask
your
name
again
shayne
said
danner
hugo
danner
good
god
not
the
football
player
i
did
play
football
some
time
ago
i
saw
you
against
cornell
when
was
it
two
years
ago
you
were
magnificent
how
does
it
happen
that
that
i
here
hugo
looked
directly
into
shayne
eyes
well
i
have
no
intention
of
prying
into
your
affairs
then
i
tell
you
why
not
hugo
drank
his
wine
i
killed
a
man
in
the
game
and
quit
beat
it
shayne
accepted
the
statement
calmly
that
tough
i
can
understand
your
desire
to
get
out
from
under
things
like
that
are
bad
when
young
what
else
could
i
have
done
nothing
what
are
you
going
to
do
rather
what
were
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
hugo
answered
slowly
what
do
you
do
what
do
people
generally
do
he
felt
the
question
was
drunken
but
shayne
accepted
it
at
its
face
value
i
one
of
those
people
who
have
too
much
money
to
be
able
to
do
anything
i
really
care
about
most
of
the
time
the
family
keeps
me
in
sight
and
control
but
i
going
to
cut
away
in
the
foreign
legion
i
go
with
you
splendid
they
shook
hands
across
the
table
three
hours
later
found
them
at
another
café
they
had
been
walking
part
of
the
time
in
the
throngs
on
the
street
for
a
while
they
had
stood
outside
a
newspaper
office
watching
the
bulletins
they
were
quite
drunk
old
man
shayne
said
i
mighty
glad
i
found
you
me
too
old
egg
where
do
we
go
next
i
do
know
what
your
favourite
vice
we
can
locate
it
in
marseilles
hugo
frowned
well
vice
is
so
limited
in
its
scope
his
companion
chuckled
is
it
i
always
said
vice
was
narrow
the
next
time
i
see
aunt
emma
i
going
to
say
vice
is
becoming
too
narrow
in
its
scope
she
be
furious
and
it
will
bring
her
to
an
early
demise
and
i
inherit
a
lot
more
money
and
that
will
be
the
real
tragedy
she
a
useless
old
fool
aunt
emma
never
did
a
valuable
thing
in
her
life
goes
in
for
charity
just
like
we
go
in
for
golf
and
oh
well
to
hell
with
aunt
emma
hugo
banged
his
glass
on
the
table
encore
deux
whiskey
à
and
to
hell
with
aunt
emma
like
to
play
roulette
like
to
try
they
climbed
into
a
taxi
shayne
gave
an
address
and
they
were
driven
to
another
quarter
of
the
town
in
a
room
packed
with
people
in
evening
clothes
they
played
for
an
hour
several
people
spoke
to
shayne
and
he
introduced
hugo
to
them
shayne
won
and
hugo
lost
they
went
out
into
the
night
the
streets
were
quieter
in
that
part
of
town
two
girls
accosted
them
that
gives
me
an
idea
shayne
said
let
find
a
phone
maybe
we
can
get
marcelle
and
claudine
marcelle
and
claudine
met
them
at
the
door
of
the
old
house
their
arms
were
laden
with
champagne
bottles
the
interior
of
the
dwelling
belied
its
cold
grey
ancient
stones
hugo
did
not
remember
much
of
what
followed
that
evening
short
unrelated
fragments
stuck
in
his
mind
shayne
chasing
the
white
form
of
marcelle
up
and
down
the
stairs
himself
in
a
huge
washing
a
back
in
front
of
him
his
surprise
when
he
saw
daylight
through
the
wooden
shutters
of
the
house
someone
was
shaking
him
come
on
soldier
the
leave
up
he
opened
his
eyes
and
collected
his
thoughts
he
grinned
at
shayne
all
right
but
if
i
had
to
defend
myself
right
now
i
fail
against
a
good
strong
mouse
we
fix
that
hey
marcelle
got
any
the
girl
came
with
two
large
glasses
of
the
hugo
swallowed
the
bitter
brown
fluid
and
shuddered
claudine
awoke
she
sighed
and
kissed
him
they
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
boy
hugo
said
what
a
binge
you
like
eet
claudine
murmured
he
took
her
hand
loved
it
darling
and
now
we
going
to
war
ah
she
said
and
at
the
door
chance
shayne
left
hugo
after
agreeing
on
a
time
and
place
for
their
meeting
in
the
afternoon
the
hours
passed
slowly
hugo
took
another
drink
and
then
exerting
his
judgment
and
will
he
refrained
from
taking
more
at
noon
he
partook
of
a
light
meal
he
thought
or
imagined
that
the
ecstasy
of
the
day
before
was
showing
some
signs
of
decline
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
people
might
be
very
sober
and
quiet
before
the
war
was
a
thing
to
be
written
into
the
history
of
france
the
sun
was
shining
he
found
a
place
in
the
shade
where
he
could
avoid
it
he
ordered
a
glass
of
beer
tasted
it
and
forgot
to
finish
it
the
elation
of
his
first
hours
had
passed
but
the
thing
within
him
that
had
caused
it
was
by
no
means
dead
as
he
sat
there
his
muscles
tensed
with
the
picturization
of
what
was
soon
to
be
he
saw
the
grim
shadows
of
the
enemy
he
felt
the
hot
splash
of
blood
for
one
suspended
second
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
then
he
stamped
out
that
shame
as
being
something
very
much
akin
to
cowardice
he
wondered
why
shayne
was
joining
the
legion
and
what
sort
of
person
he
was
underneath
his
rather
haughty
exterior
a
man
of
character
evidently
and
one
who
was
weary
of
the
world
to
which
he
had
been
privileged
hugo
reverie
veered
to
his
mother
and
father
he
tried
to
imagine
what
they
would
think
of
his
enlistment
of
him
in
the
war
and
even
what
they
thought
of
him
from
the
scant
and
scattered
information
he
had
supplied
he
was
sure
that
he
would
justify
himself
he
felt
purged
and
free
and
noble
his
strength
was
a
thing
of
wreck
and
ruin
given
to
the
world
at
a
time
when
wreck
and
ruin
were
needed
to
set
it
right
it
was
odd
that
such
a
product
should
emerge
from
the
dusty
brain
of
a
college
professor
in
a
town
hugo
had
not
possessed
a
religion
for
a
long
time
now
wondering
on
another
tangent
if
the
war
might
not
bring
about
his
end
he
thought
about
it
he
realized
that
he
would
hate
himself
for
murmuring
a
prayer
or
asking
protection
he
was
gamer
than
the
weaklings
who
were
not
wise
enough
to
look
life
in
the
face
and
not
brave
enough
to
draw
the
true
conclusions
from
what
they
saw
true
conclusions
he
meditated
what
did
it
matter
agnosticism
atheism
pantheism
anything
but
the
savage
and
anthropomorphic
twaddle
that
had
been
doled
out
since
the
israelites
singled
out
jehovah
from
among
their
many
gods
he
would
not
commit
himself
he
would
go
back
with
his
death
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
before
he
was
born
and
feel
no
more
regret
than
he
had
in
that
oblivious
past
meanwhile
he
would
fight
he
moved
restively
and
waited
for
shayne
with
growing
impatience
until
that
chaotic
and
gorgeous
hour
he
had
lived
for
nothing
proved
nothing
accomplished
nothing
society
was
no
better
in
any
way
because
he
had
lived
he
excepted
the
lives
he
had
saved
the
few
favours
he
had
done
that
was
nothing
in
proportion
to
his
powers
he
was
his
own
measure
and
by
his
own
efforts
would
he
satisfy
himself
war
he
flexed
his
arms
war
his
black
eyes
burned
with
a
formidable
light
then
shayne
came
walking
with
long
strides
a
ghostly
smile
on
his
lips
a
darkness
in
his
usually
eyes
hugo
liked
him
they
said
a
few
words
and
walked
toward
the
a
in
steely
blue
looked
at
them
and
saw
that
they
were
good
he
proffered
papers
they
signed
that
night
they
marched
for
the
first
time
a
week
later
they
were
sweating
and
swearing
over
the
french
manual
of
arms
hugo
had
offered
his
services
to
the
commanding
officer
at
the
camp
and
been
summarily
denied
an
audience
or
a
chance
to
exhibit
his
abilities
when
they
reached
the
lines
that
would
be
time
enough
well
he
could
wait
until
those
lines
were
reached
xii
just
as
the
eastern
horizon
became
light
with
something
more
steady
than
the
flare
of
the
guns
the
command
came
hugo
bit
his
lip
till
it
bled
darkly
he
would
show
them
now
they
might
command
him
to
wait
he
could
restrain
himself
no
longer
the
men
had
been
standing
there
tense
and
calm
their
bayonets
pointing
straight
up
avant
his
heart
gave
a
tremendous
surge
it
made
his
hands
falter
as
he
reached
for
the
ladder
rung
here
we
go
hugo
luck
tom
he
saw
shayne
go
over
he
followed
slowly
he
looked
at
no
man
land
they
had
come
up
in
the
night
and
he
had
never
seen
it
the
scene
of
holocaust
resembled
nothing
more
than
the
municipal
ash
dump
at
indian
creek
it
startled
him
the
grey
earth
in
irregular
heaps
the
litter
of
metal
and
equipment
he
realized
that
he
was
walking
forward
with
the
other
men
the
ground
under
his
feet
was
mushy
like
ashes
then
he
saw
part
of
a
human
body
it
changed
his
thoughts
the
man
on
hugo
right
emitted
a
noise
like
a
squeak
and
jumped
up
in
the
air
he
had
been
hit
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
hugo
saw
him
fall
get
up
quickly
and
fall
again
very
slowly
his
foot
kicked
after
he
lay
down
the
rumbling
in
the
sky
grew
louder
and
blotted
out
all
other
sound
they
walked
on
and
on
it
was
like
some
eternal
journey
through
the
dun
vacant
realms
of
hades
not
much
light
one
single
sound
and
ghostly
companions
who
faced
always
forward
the
air
in
front
of
him
was
suddenly
dyed
orange
and
he
felt
the
concussion
of
a
shell
his
ears
rang
he
was
still
walking
he
walked
what
he
thought
was
a
number
of
miles
his
great
strength
seemed
to
have
left
him
and
in
its
place
was
a
complete
enervation
with
a
deliberate
effort
he
tested
himself
kicking
his
foot
into
the
earth
it
sank
out
of
sight
he
squared
his
shoulders
a
man
came
near
him
yelling
something
it
was
shayne
hugo
shook
his
head
then
he
heard
the
voice
a
feeble
shrill
note
soon
be
there
yeah
over
that
hill
shayne
turned
away
and
became
part
of
the
ghost
escort
of
hugo
and
his
peculiarly
lucid
thoughts
he
believed
that
he
was
more
conscious
of
himself
and
things
then
than
ever
before
in
his
life
but
he
did
not
notice
of
the
expression
and
action
about
himself
the
top
of
the
rise
was
near
he
saw
an
officer
silhouetted
against
it
for
an
instant
the
officer
moved
down
the
other
side
he
could
see
over
the
rise
then
across
the
grey
ashes
was
a
long
hole
in
front
of
it
a
maze
of
wire
in
it
mushrooms
german
helmets
hugo
gaped
at
them
all
that
training
all
that
restraint
had
been
expended
for
this
they
were
small
and
without
meaning
he
felt
a
sharp
sting
above
his
collar
bone
he
looked
there
a
row
of
little
holes
had
appeared
in
his
shirt
good
god
he
whispered
a
machine
gun
but
there
was
no
blood
he
sat
down
he
presumed
as
a
casualty
he
was
justified
in
sitting
down
he
opened
his
shirt
by
ripping
it
down
on
his
skin
there
were
four
red
marks
the
bullets
had
not
penetrated
him
too
tough
he
stared
numbly
at
the
walking
men
they
had
passed
him
the
magnitude
of
his
realization
held
him
fixed
for
a
full
minute
he
was
invulnerable
he
should
have
known
it
otherwise
he
would
have
torn
himself
apart
by
his
own
strength
suddenly
he
roared
and
leaped
to
his
feet
he
snatched
his
rifle
cracking
the
stock
in
his
fervour
he
vaulted
toward
the
helmets
in
the
trench
he
dropped
from
the
parapet
and
was
confronted
by
a
long
knife
on
a
gun
his
lips
parted
his
eyes
shut
to
slits
he
drew
back
his
own
weapon
there
was
an
instant
pause
as
they
faced
each
other
two
men
both
knowing
that
in
a
few
seconds
one
would
be
dead
then
hugo
out
of
his
scarlet
fury
had
one
glimpse
of
his
antagonist
face
and
person
the
glimpse
was
but
a
flash
it
was
finished
in
quick
motions
he
was
a
little
man
a
foot
shorter
than
hugo
his
eyes
looked
out
from
under
his
helmet
with
a
sort
of
pathetic
earnestness
and
he
was
worried
horribly
worried
standing
there
with
his
rifle
lifted
and
trying
to
remember
the
precise
technique
of
what
would
follow
even
while
he
fought
back
the
realization
that
it
was
hopeless
in
that
split
second
hugo
felt
a
human
amazing
urge
to
tell
him
that
it
was
all
right
and
that
he
ought
to
hold
his
bayonet
a
little
higher
and
come
forward
a
bit
faster
the
image
faded
back
to
an
enemy
hugo
acted
mechanically
from
the
rituals
of
drill
his
own
knife
flashed
he
saw
the
man
clothes
part
smoothly
from
his
bowels
where
the
point
had
been
inserted
up
to
the
collar
the
seam
reddened
gushed
blood
and
a
length
of
intestine
slipped
out
of
it
the
man
eyes
looked
at
hugo
he
shook
his
head
twice
the
look
became
he
fell
forward
hugo
stepped
over
him
he
was
trembling
and
nauseated
a
more
formidable
man
approached
warily
the
bellow
of
battle
returned
to
hugo
ears
he
pushed
back
the
threatening
rifle
easily
and
caught
the
neck
in
one
hand
crushing
it
to
a
wet
sticky
handful
so
he
walked
through
the
trench
a
machine
that
killed
quickly
and
remorselessly
a
black
warrior
from
a
distant
realm
of
the
universe
where
the
gods
had
bred
another
kind
of
man
he
came
upon
shayne
and
found
him
engaged
hugo
stuck
his
opponent
in
the
back
no
thought
of
fair
play
no
object
but
to
kill
it
did
not
matter
how
dead
legionnaires
and
dead
germans
mingled
blood
underfoot
the
trench
was
like
the
floor
of
an
someone
gave
him
a
drink
the
men
who
remained
went
on
across
the
ash
dump
to
a
second
trench
it
was
night
the
men
almost
too
tired
to
see
or
move
were
trying
to
barricade
themselves
against
the
ceaseless
shell
fire
of
the
enemy
they
filled
bags
with
gory
mud
and
lifted
them
on
the
crumbling
walls
at
dawn
the
germans
would
return
to
do
what
they
had
done
the
darkness
reverberated
and
quivered
hugo
worked
like
a
trojan
his
efforts
had
made
a
wide
and
deep
hole
in
which
machine
guns
were
being
placed
shayne
fell
at
his
feet
hugo
lifted
him
up
the
captain
nodded
give
him
a
drink
someone
brought
liquor
and
hugo
poured
it
between
shayne
teeth
huh
shayne
said
come
on
boy
how
did
you
like
it
danner
hugo
did
not
answer
shayne
went
on
i
did
either
much
this
is
no
gentleman
war
jesus
i
saw
a
thing
or
two
this
morning
a
guy
walking
with
all
his
never
mind
take
another
drink
got
anything
to
eat
no
oh
well
we
can
fight
on
empty
bellies
the
germans
will
empty
them
for
us
anyhow
the
hell
they
will
i
pretty
nearly
all
in
so
everyone
they
put
hugo
on
watch
because
he
still
seemed
fresh
those
men
who
were
not
compelled
to
stay
awake
fell
into
the
dirt
and
slept
immediately
toward
dawn
hugo
heard
sounds
in
no
man
land
he
leaped
over
the
parapet
in
three
jumps
he
found
himself
among
the
enemy
they
were
creeping
forward
hugo
leaped
back
viennent
men
who
slept
like
death
were
kicked
conscious
they
rose
and
fired
into
the
night
the
surprise
of
the
attack
was
destroyed
the
enemy
came
on
engaging
in
the
darkness
with
the
exhausted
legionnaires
twice
hugo
went
among
them
when
inundation
threatened
and
using
his
rifle
barrel
as
a
club
laid
waste
on
every
hand
he
walked
through
them
striking
and
shattering
and
twice
he
saved
his
salient
from
extermination
day
came
sullenly
it
began
to
rain
the
men
stood
silently
among
their
dead
hugo
lit
a
cigarette
his
eyes
moved
up
and
down
the
shambles
at
intervals
of
two
yards
a
man
his
helmet
trickling
rain
his
clothes
filthy
his
face
inscrutable
shayne
was
there
on
sagging
knees
hugo
could
not
understand
why
he
had
not
been
killed
hugo
was
learning
about
war
he
thought
then
that
the
task
which
he
had
set
for
himself
was
not
altogether
to
his
liking
there
should
be
other
and
more
important
things
for
him
to
do
he
did
not
like
to
slaughter
individuals
the
day
passed
like
a
cycle
in
hell
no
change
in
the
personnel
except
that
made
by
an
occasional
death
no
food
no
water
they
seemed
to
be
exiled
by
their
countrymen
in
a
pool
of
fire
and
famine
and
destruction
at
dusk
hugo
spoke
to
the
captain
we
can
not
last
another
night
without
water
food
he
said
we
shall
die
here
then
i
should
like
sir
to
volunteer
to
go
back
and
bring
food
we
need
ammunition
more
ammunition
then
one
man
could
not
bring
enough
to
assist
much
i
can
you
are
valuable
here
with
your
club
and
your
charmed
life
you
have
already
saved
this
remnant
of
good
soldiers
i
will
return
in
less
than
an
hour
good
luck
then
where
there
had
been
a
man
there
was
nothing
the
captain
blinked
his
eyes
and
stared
at
the
place
he
swore
softly
in
french
and
plunged
into
his
at
the
sound
of
ripping
in
the
sky
a
half
hour
passed
the
steady
bombardment
continued
at
an
unvaried
pace
then
there
was
a
heavy
thud
like
that
of
a
shell
landing
and
not
exploding
the
captain
looked
a
great
bundle
tied
together
by
ropes
had
descended
into
the
trench
a
man
emerged
from
beneath
it
the
captain
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
here
was
ammunition
for
the
rifles
and
the
machine
guns
in
plenty
here
was
food
here
were
four
huge
tins
of
water
one
of
them
leaking
where
a
shell
fragment
had
pierced
it
here
was
a
crate
of
canned
meat
and
a
sack
of
onions
and
a
stack
of
bread
loaves
hugo
broke
the
ropes
his
chest
rose
and
fell
rapidly
he
was
sweating
the
bundle
he
had
carried
weighed
more
than
a
ton
and
he
had
been
running
very
swiftly
the
captain
looked
again
a
case
of
cognac
hugo
was
carrying
things
into
the
where
the
captain
asked
hugo
smiled
and
named
a
town
thirty
kilometres
behind
the
lines
a
town
where
citizens
and
soldiers
together
were
even
then
in
frenzied
discussion
over
the
giant
who
had
fallen
upon
their
stores
and
supplies
and
taken
them
running
off
like
a
locomotive
in
a
hail
of
bullets
that
did
no
harm
to
him
and
how
the
captain
asked
i
am
strong
the
captain
shrugged
and
turned
his
head
away
his
men
were
eating
the
food
and
drinking
water
mixed
with
brandy
and
stuffing
their
pouches
with
ammunition
the
machine
gunners
were
laughing
they
would
not
be
forced
to
spare
the
precious
belts
when
the
germans
came
in
the
morning
hugo
sat
among
them
dining
his
tremendous
appetite
three
days
went
by
every
day
twice
five
times
they
were
attacked
but
no
offence
seemed
capable
of
driving
that
demoniac
cluster
of
men
from
their
position
a
demon
so
the
enemy
whispered
came
out
and
fought
for
them
on
the
third
day
the
enemy
retreated
along
four
kilometres
of
front
and
the
french
moved
up
to
reclaim
many
many
acres
of
their
beloved
soil
the
legionnaires
were
relieved
and
another
episode
was
added
to
their
valiant
history
hugo
slept
for
twenty
hours
in
the
wooden
barracks
after
that
he
was
wakened
by
the
captain
orderly
and
summoned
to
his
quarters
the
captain
smiled
when
he
saluted
my
friend
he
said
i
wish
to
thank
you
in
behalf
of
my
country
for
your
labour
i
have
recommended
you
for
the
croix
de
guerre
hugo
took
his
outstretched
hand
i
am
pleased
that
i
have
helped
and
now
the
captain
continued
you
will
tell
me
how
you
executed
that
so
unusual
coup
hugo
hesitated
it
was
the
opportunity
he
had
sought
the
chance
that
might
lead
to
a
special
commission
whereby
he
could
wreak
the
vengeance
of
his
muscles
on
the
enemy
but
he
was
careful
because
he
did
not
feel
secure
in
trusting
the
captain
with
too
much
of
his
secret
even
in
a
war
it
was
too
terrible
they
would
mistrust
him
or
they
would
attempt
to
send
him
to
their
biologists
and
he
wanted
to
accomplish
his
mission
under
their
permission
and
with
their
it
would
be
more
valuable
then
and
of
greater
magnitude
so
he
smiled
and
said
have
you
ever
heard
of
colorado
no
i
have
not
heard
it
is
a
place
a
place
in
america
a
place
that
has
scarcely
been
explored
i
was
born
there
and
all
the
men
of
colorado
are
born
as
i
was
born
and
are
like
me
we
are
very
strong
we
are
great
fighters
we
can
not
be
wounded
except
by
the
largest
shells
i
took
that
package
by
force
and
i
carried
it
to
you
on
my
back
running
swiftly
the
captain
appeared
politely
interested
he
thumbed
a
dispatch
he
stared
at
hugo
if
that
is
the
truth
you
shall
show
me
it
is
the
truth
and
i
shall
show
you
hugo
looked
around
finally
he
walked
over
to
the
sentry
at
the
flap
of
the
tent
and
took
his
rifle
the
man
squealed
in
protest
hugo
lifted
him
off
the
floor
by
the
collar
shook
him
and
set
him
down
the
man
shouted
in
dismay
and
then
was
silent
at
a
word
from
the
captain
hugo
weighed
the
gun
in
his
hands
while
they
watched
and
then
slowly
bent
the
barrel
double
next
he
tore
it
from
its
stock
then
he
grasped
the
parallel
steel
ends
and
broke
them
apart
with
a
swift
wrench
the
captain
half
rose
his
eyes
bulged
he
knocked
over
his
his
hand
tugged
at
his
moustache
and
waved
spasmodically
you
see
hugo
said
the
captain
went
to
staff
meeting
that
afternoon
very
thoughtful
he
understood
the
difficulty
of
exhibiting
his
soldier
prowess
under
circumstances
that
would
assure
the
proper
commission
he
even
considered
remaining
silent
about
hugo
with
such
a
man
in
his
company
it
would
soon
be
illustrious
along
the
whole
broad
front
but
the
chance
came
when
the
meeting
was
finished
and
the
officers
relaxed
over
their
wine
a
colonel
brought
up
the
subject
of
the
merits
of
various
breeds
of
men
as
soldiers
i
think
he
said
that
the
prussians
are
undoubtedly
our
most
dangerous
foe
on
our
own
side
we
have
begging
the
colonel
pardon
the
captain
said
there
is
a
species
of
fighter
unknown
or
almost
unknown
in
this
part
of
the
world
who
excels
by
far
all
others
and
who
may
they
be
the
colonel
asked
stiffly
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
colorados
no
the
colonel
said
another
officer
meditated
they
are
redskins
american
indians
are
they
not
the
captain
shrugged
i
do
not
know
i
know
only
that
they
are
superior
to
all
other
soldiers
and
in
what
way
the
captain
eyes
flickered
i
have
one
colorado
in
my
troops
i
will
tell
you
what
he
did
in
five
days
near
the
town
of
barsine
the
officers
listened
when
the
captain
finished
the
colonel
patted
his
shoulder
that
is
a
very
amusing
fabrication
very
with
a
thousand
such
men
the
war
would
be
ended
in
a
week
captain
crouan
i
fear
you
have
been
overgenerous
in
pouring
the
wine
the
captain
rose
saluted
with
your
permission
i
shall
cause
my
colorado
to
be
brought
and
you
shall
see
the
other
men
laughed
bring
him
by
all
means
the
captain
dispatched
an
orderly
a
few
minutes
later
hugo
was
announced
at
headquarters
the
captain
introduced
him
here
messieurs
is
a
colorado
what
will
you
have
him
do
the
colonel
who
had
expected
the
soldier
to
be
both
embarrassed
and
made
ridiculous
was
impressed
by
hugo
calm
demeanour
you
are
strong
he
said
with
a
faint
irony
exceedingly
he
is
not
humble
at
least
gentlemen
laughter
the
colonel
fixed
hugo
with
his
eye
then
my
good
fellow
if
you
are
so
strong
if
you
can
run
so
swiftly
and
carry
such
burdens
bring
us
one
of
our
beautiful
from
the
artillery
with
your
written
order
if
you
please
the
colonel
started
wrote
the
order
laughingly
and
gave
it
to
hugo
he
left
the
room
it
is
a
good
joke
the
colonel
said
but
i
fear
it
is
harsh
on
the
private
the
captain
shrugged
wine
was
poured
in
a
few
minutes
they
heard
heavy
footsteps
outside
the
tent
he
is
here
the
captain
cried
the
officers
rushed
forward
hugo
stood
outside
the
tent
with
the
cannon
they
had
requested
lifted
over
his
head
in
one
hand
with
that
same
hand
clasped
on
the
breach
he
set
it
down
the
colonel
paled
and
gulped
name
of
the
mother
of
god
he
has
brought
it
hugo
nodded
it
was
as
nothing
my
colonel
now
i
will
show
you
what
we
men
from
colorado
can
do
watch
they
eyed
him
there
was
a
grating
sound
beneath
his
feet
those
who
were
quickest
of
vision
saw
his
body
catapult
through
the
air
high
over
their
heads
it
landed
bounced
prodigiously
vanished
captain
crouan
coughed
and
swallowed
he
faced
his
superiors
trying
to
seem
nonchalant
that
gentlemen
is
the
sort
of
thing
the
colorados
do
for
sport
the
colonel
recovered
first
it
is
not
human
gentlemen
we
have
been
in
the
presence
of
the
devil
himself
or
the
good
lord
the
captain
shook
his
head
he
is
a
man
i
tell
you
in
colorado
all
the
men
are
like
that
he
told
me
so
himself
when
he
first
enlisted
he
came
to
me
and
asked
for
a
special
commission
to
go
to
berlin
and
smash
the
reich
to
bring
back
the
kaiser
himself
i
thought
he
was
mad
i
made
him
peel
potatoes
he
did
not
say
any
more
foolish
things
he
was
a
good
soldier
then
the
battle
came
and
i
saw
him
not
believing
i
saw
him
standing
on
the
parapet
and
wielding
his
rifle
like
the
lightning
killing
i
do
not
know
how
many
men
hundreds
certainly
perhaps
thousands
ah
it
is
as
i
said
the
colorados
are
the
finest
soldiers
on
earth
they
are
more
than
men
he
comes
hugo
burst
from
the
sky
moving
like
a
hawk
he
came
from
the
direction
of
the
lines
many
miles
away
there
was
a
bundle
slung
across
his
shoulder
there
were
holes
in
his
uniform
he
landed
heavily
among
the
officers
and
set
down
his
burden
it
was
a
german
he
dropped
to
the
ground
water
for
him
hugo
panted
he
has
fainted
i
snatched
him
from
his
outpost
in
a
trench
xiii
at
blaisencourt
it
was
spring
again
the
war
was
nearly
a
year
old
blaisencourt
was
now
a
street
of
houses
ghosts
of
rubble
and
dirt
populated
by
soldiers
a
little
new
grass
sprouted
peevishly
here
and
there
an
occasional
house
retained
enough
of
its
original
shape
to
harbour
an
industry
captain
crouan
his
arm
in
a
sling
was
looking
over
a
heap
of
débris
with
the
aid
of
field
glasses
i
see
him
he
said
pointing
to
a
place
on
the
boiling
field
where
an
apparent
lump
of
soil
had
detached
itself
he
rises
he
goes
on
he
takes
one
of
his
mighty
leaps
ah
god
if
i
only
had
a
company
of
such
men
his
aide
squatted
near
by
muttered
something
under
his
breath
the
captain
spoke
again
he
is
very
near
their
infernal
little
gun
now
he
has
taken
his
rope
ahaaaa
he
spins
it
in
the
air
it
falls
they
are
astonished
they
rise
up
in
the
trench
quick
phèdre
give
me
a
rifle
the
rifle
barked
sharply
four
five
times
its
bullet
found
a
mark
then
another
ahaaa
two
of
them
and
danner
now
has
his
rope
on
that
pig
breath
it
comes
up
see
he
has
taken
it
under
his
arm
they
are
shooting
their
machine
guns
he
drops
into
a
shell
hole
he
has
been
hit
but
he
is
laughing
at
them
he
leaps
look
out
phèdre
hugo
landed
behind
the
débris
with
a
small
german
trench
mortar
in
his
arms
he
set
it
on
the
floor
the
captain
opened
his
mouth
and
hugo
waved
to
him
to
be
silent
deliberately
hugo
looked
over
the
rickety
parapet
of
loose
stones
he
elevated
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
and
drew
back
the
lanyard
the
captain
grinning
watched
through
his
glasses
the
gun
roared
its
shell
exploded
presently
on
the
brow
of
the
enemy
trench
tossing
up
a
column
of
smoke
and
earth
i
should
have
brought
some
ammunition
with
me
hugo
said
captain
crouan
stared
at
the
little
gun
pig
he
said
son
of
a
pig
five
of
my
men
are
in
your
little
belly
bah
he
kicked
it
summer
in
a
tall
englishman
addressing
captain
crouan
his
voice
was
irritated
by
the
heat
is
it
true
that
you
french
have
an
indian
scout
here
who
can
bash
in
those
minenwerfers
mon
colonel
mais
je
ne
comprends
pas
he
began
again
in
bad
french
captain
crouan
smiled
ah
you
are
troubled
there
on
your
sector
you
wish
to
borrow
our
astonishing
soldier
it
will
be
a
pleasure
i
assure
you
hot
calm
night
the
sky
with
stars
the
air
redolent
with
the
mushy
flavour
of
dead
meat
so
strong
it
left
a
taste
in
the
mouth
so
strong
that
food
and
water
tasted
like
faintly
chlorinated
putrescence
hugo
his
blue
uniform
darker
with
perspiration
tramped
through
the
blackness
to
a
fifteen
minutes
in
candlelight
with
a
man
who
spoke
english
in
an
odd
manner
they
been
raisin
bloody
hell
with
us
from
a
point
about
there
the
tap
of
a
pencil
we
got
little
enough
confidence
in
you
god
knows
thank
you
do
be
huffy
we
obliged
to
your
captain
for
the
loan
of
you
but
we
lost
too
many
trying
to
take
the
place
ourselves
not
to
be
fed
up
with
it
i
suppose
you
want
a
raiding
party
no
thanks
but
cripes
you
ca
make
it
there
alone
i
can
do
it
hugo
smiled
and
you
lost
so
many
of
your
own
men
very
well
otto
meyer
pushed
his
helmet
back
on
his
head
and
gasped
in
the
feverish
air
a
officer
passing
behind
him
shoved
the
helmet
over
his
eyes
with
a
muttered
word
of
caution
otto
shrugged
half
a
dozen
men
lounged
near
by
beside
and
above
them
were
the
muzzles
of
four
squat
guns
and
the
irregular
silhouette
of
a
heap
of
ammunition
two
of
the
men
rolled
onto
their
backs
and
panted
i
wish
one
said
in
a
soft
voice
that
i
was
back
in
the
hofbrau
at
munich
with
a
tall
stein
of
beer
with
that
fat
that
kissed
me
in
the
potsdam
station
last
september
sitting
at
my
side
and
the
orchestra
playing
otto
flung
a
clod
of
dank
earth
at
the
speaker
there
were
chuckles
from
the
shadows
that
sucked
in
and
exhaled
the
rancid
air
outside
the
pit
in
which
they
lay
there
was
a
gentle
thud
otto
scrambled
into
a
sitting
posture
what
is
that
nothing
even
these
damned
english
are
low
enough
to
fight
us
in
this
weather
you
can
never
tell
at
night
in
the
first
battle
of
listen
the
thud
was
repeated
much
closer
it
was
an
ominous
sound
like
the
drop
of
a
sack
of
earth
from
a
great
height
otto
picked
up
a
gun
he
was
a
man
who
perspired
freely
and
now
in
that
single
minute
his
face
trickled
he
pointed
the
gun
into
the
air
and
pulled
the
trigger
it
kicked
back
and
jarred
his
arm
in
the
glaring
light
that
followed
six
men
peered
through
the
of
the
wire
they
saw
nothing
you
see
their
eyes
smarted
with
the
light
and
dark
so
swiftly
exchanged
came
a
thud
in
their
midst
a
great
thud
that
spattered
the
dirt
in
all
directions
something
has
fallen
a
shell
it
a
dud
the
men
rose
and
tried
to
run
otto
had
regained
his
vision
and
saw
the
object
that
had
descended
a
package
of
yellow
sticks
tied
to
a
great
mass
of
iron
wired
to
it
instead
of
running
he
grasped
it
his
strength
was
not
enough
to
lift
it
then
for
one
short
eternity
he
saw
a
sizzling
spark
move
toward
the
sticks
he
clutched
at
it
help
the
guns
must
be
saved
a
bomb
he
knew
his
arms
surrounded
death
i
can
not
his
feeble
voice
was
blown
to
the
four
winds
at
that
instant
a
terrible
explosion
burst
from
him
shattering
the
escaping
men
blasting
the
howitzers
into
fragments
enlarging
the
pit
to
enormous
dimensions
both
fronts
clattered
with
fire
flares
lit
the
terrain
hugo
running
as
if
with
boots
was
thrown
on
his
face
by
the
concussion
winter
mud
a
light
fall
of
snow
that
was
split
into
festers
by
the
guns
before
it
could
anneal
the
ancient
sores
hugo
shivered
and
stared
into
no
man
land
whence
a
groan
had
issued
for
twenty
hours
audible
occasionally
over
the
tumult
of
the
artillery
he
saw
german
eyes
turned
mutely
on
the
same
heap
of
rags
that
moved
pitifully
over
the
snow
leaving
a
red
wake
dragging
a
bloody
thing
behind
it
rose
and
fell
moving
parallel
to
the
two
trenches
many
bullets
had
either
missed
it
or
increased
its
crimson
torment
hugo
went
out
and
killed
the
heap
of
rags
with
a
revolver
that
cracked
until
the
groans
stopped
in
a
low
moan
breaths
on
both
sides
were
bated
the
rags
had
been
a
shout
of
low
rumbling
praise
came
from
the
silent
enemy
trenches
hugo
looked
over
there
for
a
moment
and
smiled
he
looked
down
at
the
thing
and
vomited
the
guns
began
again
another
winter
time
had
become
stagnant
all
about
it
was
a
pool
of
mud
and
suppuration
and
shot
through
it
was
the
sound
of
guns
and
the
scent
of
women
the
taste
of
wine
and
the
touch
of
cold
flesh
somewhere
he
could
not
remember
distinctly
where
hugo
had
a
clean
uniform
a
portfolio
of
papers
a
of
medals
he
was
a
great
man
a
man
feared
the
colorado
in
the
foreign
legion
men
would
talk
about
what
they
had
seen
him
accomplish
all
through
the
next
fifty
years
at
watering
places
in
the
sahara
at
the
crackling
fires
of
parties
in
shropshire
on
the
shores
of
the
south
seas
on
the
moon
maybe
old
men
at
the
last
would
clear
the
phlegm
from
their
skinny
throats
and
begin
when
i
was
with
the
legion
in
my
youngest
days
there
was
a
fellow
in
our
company
that
came
from
some
place
in
wild
america
that
i
disrecollect
and
younger
more
sanguine
men
would
listen
and
shake
their
heads
and
wish
that
there
was
a
war
for
them
to
fight
hugo
was
not
satisfied
with
that
still
he
could
see
no
decent
exit
and
contrive
no
better
use
for
himself
he
clung
frantically
to
the
ideals
he
had
taken
with
him
and
to
the
splendid
purpose
with
which
he
had
emblazoned
his
mad
lust
to
enlist
marseilles
and
the
sentiment
it
had
inspired
seemed
very
far
away
he
thought
about
it
as
he
walked
toward
the
front
his
head
bent
into
the
gale
and
his
helmet
pitched
to
protect
his
eyes
from
the
sting
of
the
rain
that
night
he
slept
with
shayne
a
lieutenant
now
twice
wounded
thrice
decorated
and
like
hugo
thinner
than
he
had
been
older
with
eyes
grown
bleak
and
seldom
vehement
he
resembled
his
lean
yankee
ancestors
after
their
exhausting
campaigns
of
the
wilderness
alive
and
sentient
only
through
a
sheer
stubbornness
that
brooked
neither
element
nor
disaster
only
at
rare
moments
did
the
slight
strain
of
his
french
blood
lift
him
from
that
grim
posture
such
a
moment
was
afforded
by
the
arrival
of
hugo
great
god
hugo
we
have
seen
you
in
a
dog
age
other
soldiers
smiled
and
brought
rusty
cigarettes
into
the
where
they
sat
and
smoked
hugo
held
out
his
hand
been
busy
glad
to
see
you
yes
i
know
how
busy
you
been
up
and
down
the
lines
we
hear
about
you
damn
funny
war
you
think
you
were
human
or
anywhere
near
human
to
hear
these
birds
wish
you
tell
me
how
you
get
away
with
it
has
one
nicked
you
yet
not
yet
god
damn
got
me
here
he
tapped
his
shoulder
and
here
his
thigh
that
tough
i
guess
the
sort
of
work
i
do
is
calculated
to
be
as
risky
as
yours
hugo
said
huh
that
you
can
tell
to
sweeny
the
frenchmen
were
still
sitting
politely
listening
to
a
dialogue
they
could
not
understand
hugo
and
shayne
eyed
each
other
in
silence
a
long
penetrating
silence
at
length
the
latter
said
soberly
still
as
enthusiastic
as
you
were
that
night
in
marseilles
are
you
i
did
have
much
conception
of
what
war
would
be
then
neither
did
i
hugo
responded
and
i
not
very
enthusiastic
any
more
oh
well
exactly
heard
from
your
family
sure
well
they
relapsed
into
silence
again
by
and
by
they
ate
a
meal
of
cold
food
supplemented
by
rank
steaming
coffee
then
they
slept
before
dawn
hugo
woke
feeling
like
a
man
in
the
mouth
of
a
volcano
that
had
commenced
to
erupt
the
universe
was
shaking
the
walls
of
the
were
molting
chunks
of
earth
the
scream
and
burst
of
shells
were
constant
he
heard
shayne
voice
above
the
din
issuing
orders
in
french
their
batteries
were
to
be
phoned
a
protective
a
in
readiness
in
case
of
attack
which
seemed
imminent
larger
shells
drowned
the
voice
hugo
rose
and
stood
beside
shayne
coming
over
coming
over
a
shapeless
face
spoke
in
the
gloom
the
voice
panted
we
must
get
out
of
here
my
lieutenant
they
are
smashing
in
the
a
methodical
scramble
to
the
orifice
hell
was
rampaging
in
the
trench
the
shells
fell
everywhere
shayne
shook
his
head
it
was
neither
light
nor
dark
the
incessant
blinding
fire
did
not
make
things
visible
except
for
fragments
of
time
and
in
fantastic
perspectives
things
belched
and
boomed
and
smashed
the
earth
and
whistled
and
howled
it
was
impossible
to
see
how
life
could
exist
in
that
caldron
and
yet
men
stood
calmly
all
along
the
line
a
few
of
them
here
and
there
were
obliterated
the
red
sky
in
the
southeast
became
redder
with
the
rising
sun
hugo
remained
close
to
the
wall
it
was
no
novelty
for
him
to
be
under
shell
fire
but
at
such
times
he
felt
the
need
of
a
caution
with
which
he
could
ordinarily
dispense
if
one
of
the
steel
cylinders
found
him
even
his
mighty
frame
might
not
contain
itself
even
he
might
be
rent
asunder
shayne
saw
him
and
smiled
twenty
yards
away
a
geyser
of
fire
sprayed
the
heavens
ten
feet
away
a
fragment
of
shell
lashed
down
a
pile
of
shayne
smile
widened
hugo
returned
it
then
red
fury
enveloped
the
two
men
hugo
was
crushed
ferociously
against
the
wall
and
liberated
in
the
same
second
he
fell
forward
his
ears
singing
and
his
head
dizzy
he
lay
there
aching
dark
red
stains
flowed
over
his
face
from
his
nose
and
ears
painfully
he
stood
up
a
soldier
was
watching
him
from
a
distance
with
alarmed
eyes
hugo
stepped
he
found
that
locomotion
was
possible
the
bedlam
increased
it
brought
a
sort
of
madness
he
remembered
shayne
he
searched
in
the
smoking
stinking
muck
he
found
the
shoulders
and
part
of
head
he
picked
them
up
in
his
hands
disregarding
the
butchered
ends
of
the
raw
gobbet
white
electricity
crackled
in
his
head
he
leaped
to
the
parapet
shaking
his
fists
god
damn
you
dirty
sons
of
bitches
i
make
you
pay
for
this
you
got
him
got
him
you
bastards
i
shove
your
filthy
hides
down
the
devil
throat
and
through
his
guts
oh
jesus
he
did
not
feel
the
frantic
tugging
of
his
fellows
he
ran
into
that
bubbling
chaos
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
maniacal
profanities
a
dozen
times
he
was
knocked
down
he
bled
slowly
where
fragments
had
battered
him
he
crossed
over
and
paused
on
the
german
parapet
he
was
like
a
being
of
steel
bullets
sprayed
him
his
arms
dangled
and
lifted
barbed
wire
trailed
behind
him
down
before
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
the
attacking
regiments
waited
for
the
last
crescendo
of
the
bombardment
they
saw
him
come
out
of
the
fury
and
smiled
grimly
they
knew
such
madness
they
shot
he
came
on
at
last
they
could
hear
his
voice
dimly
through
the
tumult
someone
shouted
that
he
was
mad
to
beware
when
he
fell
hugo
jumped
among
them
bayonets
rose
hugo
wrenched
three
knives
from
their
wielders
in
one
wild
clutch
his
hands
went
out
snatching
and
squeezing
that
was
all
no
weapons
no
defence
just
hands
whatever
they
caught
they
crushed
flat
and
heads
fell
into
those
dreadful
fingers
sides
legs
arms
bellies
bayonets
slid
from
his
tawny
skin
taking
his
clothes
by
and
by
except
for
his
shoes
he
was
naked
his
fingers
had
made
a
hundred
bunches
of
clotted
pulp
and
then
a
thousand
as
he
walked
swiftly
forward
in
that
trench
ahead
of
him
was
a
file
of
green
behind
a
clogged
row
of
writhing
men
scarcely
did
the
occupants
of
each
new
traverse
see
him
before
they
were
smitten
the
wounds
he
inflicted
were
monstrous
on
he
walked
his
voice
now
stilled
his
breath
sucking
and
whistling
through
his
teeth
his
hands
flailing
and
pinching
and
spurting
red
with
every
contact
no
more
formidable
engine
of
desolation
had
been
seen
by
man
no
more
titanic
fury
no
swifter
and
surer
death
for
thirty
minutes
he
raged
through
that
line
the
men
thinned
he
had
crossed
the
attacking
front
then
the
barrage
lifted
but
no
whistles
blew
no
soldiers
rose
a
few
raised
their
heads
and
then
lay
down
again
hugo
stopped
and
went
back
into
the
he
leaped
to
the
parapet
the
french
saw
him
silhouetted
against
the
sky
the
second
german
wave
coming
slowly
over
a
far
hill
saw
him
and
hesitated
no
ragged
line
of
advancing
men
no
cacophony
of
rifle
fire
only
that
strange
savage
figure
a
man
dipped
in
scarlet
nude
dripping
panting
slowly
in
that
hiatus
he
wheeled
his
lungs
thundered
to
the
french
come
on
you
black
bastards
killed
them
all
come
on
we
send
them
down
to
hell
the
officers
looked
and
understood
that
something
phenomenal
had
happened
no
germans
were
coming
a
man
stood
above
their
trench
come
quick
hugo
shouted
he
saw
that
they
did
not
understand
he
stood
an
instant
fell
into
the
trench
and
presently
a
shower
of
german
corpses
flung
through
the
air
in
wide
arcs
and
landed
on
the
very
edge
of
the
french
position
then
they
came
and
hugo
seeing
them
went
on
alone
to
meet
the
second
line
he
might
have
forged
on
through
that
bloody
swathe
to
the
heart
of
the
empire
if
his
vitality
had
been
endless
but
some
time
in
the
battle
he
fell
unconscious
on
the
field
and
his
comrades
pushing
back
the
startled
enemy
found
him
lying
there
they
made
a
little
knot
around
him
silent
quivering
it
is
the
colorado
someone
said
his
friend
shayne
it
is
he
who
was
the
lieutenant
just
killed
they
shook
their
heads
and
felt
a
strange
fear
of
the
unconscious
man
he
is
breathing
they
called
for
they
faced
the
enemy
again
bent
over
on
the
stocks
of
their
rifles
surged
forward
hugo
was
washed
and
dressed
in
pyjamas
his
wounds
had
healed
without
the
necessity
of
a
single
stitch
he
was
grateful
for
that
otherwise
the
surgeons
might
have
had
a
surprise
which
would
have
been
difficult
to
allay
he
sat
in
a
wheel
chair
staring
across
a
lawn
an
angular
woman
in
an
angular
hat
and
tailored
clothes
was
trying
to
engage
him
in
conversation
is
it
very
painful
my
man
hugo
was
seeing
that
trench
again
the
pulp
and
blood
and
hate
of
it
not
very
her
tongue
and
saliva
made
a
noise
do
tell
me
i
know
it
was
i
know
how
you
all
bleed
and
suffer
madam
it
happens
that
my
wounds
were
quite
superficial
nonsense
my
boy
they
would
have
brought
you
to
a
base
hospital
in
that
case
you
ca
fool
me
i
was
suffering
only
from
exhaustion
she
paused
he
saw
a
gleam
in
her
eye
i
suppose
you
do
like
to
talk
about
things
poor
boy
but
i
imagine
your
life
has
been
so
full
of
horror
that
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
unburden
yourself
now
tell
me
just
what
does
it
feel
like
to
bayonet
a
man
hugo
trembled
he
controlled
his
voice
madam
he
replied
it
feels
exactly
like
sticking
your
finger
into
a
warm
steaming
pile
of
oh
she
gasped
and
he
heard
her
repeat
it
again
in
the
corridor
xiv
and
ralph
jordan
shayne
hugo
wrote
then
he
paused
in
thought
he
began
again
i
met
your
son
in
marseilles
and
was
with
him
most
of
the
time
until
his
death
he
hesitated
in
fact
he
died
in
my
arms
from
the
effect
of
the
same
shell
which
sent
me
to
this
hospital
he
is
buried
in
carcy
cemetery
on
the
south
side
it
is
for
that
reason
i
take
the
liberty
to
address
you
i
thought
that
you
would
like
to
know
some
of
the
things
that
he
did
not
write
to
you
your
son
enlisted
because
he
felt
the
war
involved
certain
ideals
that
were
worthy
of
preservation
that
he
gave
his
life
for
those
ideals
must
be
a
source
of
pride
to
you
in
training
he
was
always
controlled
kindly
unquarrelsome
comprehending
in
battle
he
was
aggressive
brilliant
and
more
courageous
than
any
other
man
i
have
ever
known
in
october
a
year
ago
he
was
decorated
for
bringing
in
captain
crouan
who
was
severely
wounded
during
an
attack
that
was
repulsed
under
heavy
shell
fire
tom
went
boldly
into
no
land
and
carried
the
officer
from
a
shell
pit
on
his
back
at
the
time
tom
himself
sustained
three
wounds
he
was
mentioned
a
number
of
times
in
the
dispatches
for
his
leadership
of
attacks
and
patrols
he
was
decorated
a
second
time
for
the
capture
of
a
german
field
officer
and
three
of
his
staff
a
coup
which
your
son
executed
almost
following
his
death
his
company
made
an
attack
to
avenge
him
which
wiped
out
the
entire
enemy
position
along
a
sector
nearly
a
kilometre
in
width
and
which
brought
a
permanent
advantage
to
the
allied
lines
that
is
mute
testimony
of
his
popularity
among
the
officers
and
men
i
know
of
no
man
more
worthy
of
the
name
no
american
more
worthy
of
the
words
and
i
realize
the
slight
comfort
of
these
things
and
yet
i
feel
bound
to
tell
you
of
them
because
tom
was
my
friend
and
his
death
is
grievous
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
yours
sincerely
lieutenant
hugo
danner
hugo
posted
the
letter
when
the
answer
came
he
was
once
again
in
action
the
guns
chugging
and
rumbling
the
earth
shaking
the
reply
read
dear
lieutenant
danner
thank
you
for
your
letter
in
reference
to
our
son
we
knew
that
he
had
enlisted
in
some
foreign
service
we
did
not
know
of
his
death
i
am
having
your
statements
checked
because
if
they
are
true
i
shall
be
one
of
the
happiest
persons
alive
and
his
mother
will
be
both
happy
and
sad
the
side
of
young
tom
which
you
claim
to
have
seen
is
one
quite
unfamiliar
to
us
at
home
he
was
always
a
waster
much
of
a
snob
and
impossible
to
control
it
may
be
harsh
to
say
such
things
of
him
now
that
he
is
dead
but
i
can
not
recall
one
noble
deed
one
unselfish
act
in
his
life
here
with
us
that
i
have
a
dead
son
would
not
sadden
me
tom
had
been
disinherited
by
us
his
mother
and
father
but
that
my
dead
son
was
a
hero
makes
me
feel
that
at
last
coming
into
the
shayne
blood
and
heritage
he
has
atoned
and
so
i
honour
him
if
the
records
show
that
all
you
said
of
him
is
true
i
shall
not
only
honour
him
in
this
country
but
i
shall
come
to
france
to
pay
my
tribute
with
a
full
heart
and
a
knowledge
that
neither
he
nor
i
lived
in
vain
gratefully
yours
shayne
hugo
reread
the
letter
and
stood
awhile
with
wistful
eyes
he
remembered
shayne
aunt
emma
shayne
bitter
calumniation
of
his
family
well
they
had
not
understood
him
and
he
had
not
wanted
them
to
understand
him
perhaps
shayne
had
been
more
content
than
he
admitted
in
the
mud
of
the
trenches
the
war
had
been
a
real
thing
to
him
hugo
thought
of
its
insufficiencies
for
himself
the
world
was
not
enough
for
shayne
but
the
war
had
been
both
were
insufficient
for
hugo
danner
he
listened
to
the
thunder
in
the
sky
tiredly
two
months
later
hugo
was
ordered
from
rest
billets
to
the
quarters
a
man
and
woman
accompanied
by
a
sleek
frenchman
awaited
him
the
man
stepped
forward
with
dignified
courtesy
i
am
tom
shayne
father
this
is
mrs
shayne
hugo
felt
a
great
lack
of
interest
in
them
they
had
come
too
late
it
was
their
son
who
had
been
his
friend
he
almost
regretted
the
letter
he
shook
hands
with
them
shayne
went
to
an
automobile
her
husband
invited
hugo
to
a
café
over
the
wine
he
became
suddenly
less
dignified
more
human
and
almost
pathetic
tell
me
about
him
danner
i
loved
that
kid
once
you
know
hugo
found
himself
unexpectedly
moved
the
man
was
so
eager
so
strangely
happy
he
stroked
his
white
moustache
and
turned
away
moist
eyes
so
hugo
told
him
he
talked
endlessly
of
the
trenches
and
the
dark
wet
nights
and
the
fire
that
stabbed
through
them
he
invented
brave
sorties
for
his
friend
tripled
his
accomplishments
and
put
gaiety
and
wit
in
his
mouth
the
father
drank
every
syllable
as
if
he
was
committing
the
whole
story
to
memory
as
the
text
of
a
life
solace
at
last
he
was
crying
that
was
the
tom
i
knew
hugo
said
softly
and
that
was
the
tom
i
dreamed
and
hoped
and
thought
he
would
become
when
he
was
a
little
shaver
well
he
did
danner
a
thousand
times
he
did
ralph
jordan
shayne
blew
his
nose
unashamedly
he
thought
of
his
patiently
waiting
wife
i
got
to
go
i
suppose
this
has
been
more
than
kind
of
you
danner
lieutenant
danner
i
glad
more
glad
than
i
can
say
that
you
were
there
i
understand
from
the
major
that
you
no
small
shakes
in
this
army
yourself
he
smiled
deferentially
i
wish
there
was
something
we
could
do
for
you
nothing
thank
you
mr
shayne
i
going
to
give
you
my
card
in
new
york
my
name
is
not
without
meaning
it
is
very
familiar
to
me
was
before
i
met
your
son
if
you
ever
come
to
the
city
i
mean
when
you
come
you
must
look
us
up
anything
we
can
do
in
the
way
of
jobs
positions
he
was
confused
hugo
shook
his
head
that
very
kind
of
you
sir
but
i
have
some
means
of
my
own
and
right
now
i
not
even
thinking
of
going
back
to
new
york
shayne
stepped
into
the
car
i
would
like
to
do
something
hugo
realized
the
sincerity
of
that
desire
he
reflected
nothing
i
can
think
of
i
a
banker
perhaps
if
i
might
take
the
liberty
i
could
handle
your
affairs
hugo
smiled
my
affairs
consist
of
one
bank
account
in
the
city
loan
that
would
seem
very
small
to
you
mr
shayne
why
that
one
of
my
banks
i
arrange
it
you
know
and
i
know
how
small
the
matter
of
money
is
but
i
appreciate
your
turning
over
some
of
your
capital
to
me
i
would
consider
it
a
blessed
opportunity
to
return
a
service
a
great
service
with
a
small
one
i
afraid
thanks
hugo
said
the
banker
scribbled
a
statement
asked
a
question
and
raised
his
eyebrows
over
the
amount
hugo
gave
him
then
he
was
the
father
again
we
been
to
the
cemetery
danner
we
owe
that
privilege
to
you
it
says
there
in
french
remains
of
a
great
hero
who
gave
his
life
for
france
not
america
my
boy
but
i
think
that
france
was
a
worthy
cause
when
they
had
gone
hugo
spent
a
disturbed
afternoon
he
had
not
been
so
moved
in
many
many
months
xv
now
the
streets
of
paris
were
assailed
by
the
colour
of
olive
drab
the
twang
of
yankee
accents
the
music
of
broadway
songs
hugo
watched
the
first
parade
with
eyes
somewhat
proud
and
not
a
little
sombre
each
shuffling
step
seemed
to
ask
a
rhythmic
question
who
would
not
return
to
paris
who
would
return
once
and
not
again
who
would
be
blind
who
would
be
hideous
who
would
be
armless
legless
who
would
wear
silver
plates
and
leather
props
for
his
declining
years
hugo
wondered
and
looking
into
those
sometimes
stern
and
sometimes
ribald
faces
he
saw
that
they
had
not
yet
commenced
to
wonder
they
did
not
know
the
hammer
and
shock
of
falling
shells
and
the
jelly
and
putty
which
men
became
they
chafed
and
bantered
and
stormed
every
café
and
cocotte
impartially
recklessly
even
the
legion
had
been
more
grim
and
better
prepared
for
the
iron
feet
of
war
they
fell
upon
hugo
with
their
atrocious
french
two
young
men
who
wanted
a
drink
and
could
not
make
the
understand
hey
they
called
to
him
dire
que
nous
voulez
des
choses
boire
hugo
smiled
what
do
you
birds
want
to
drink
god
almighty
here
a
frog
that
speaks
united
states
get
the
gang
what
your
name
bo
danner
come
on
an
have
a
flock
of
drinks
on
us
you
probably
dying
on
french
pay
you
order
for
the
gang
and
we
treat
eager
grinning
american
faces
can
you
get
whisky
in
this
dump
straight
or
highball
that
the
talk
straight
dan
we
in
the
army
now
hugo
drank
with
them
only
for
one
moment
did
they
remember
they
were
in
the
army
to
fight
say
dan
the
war
really
is
as
tough
as
they
claim
is
it
i
do
know
how
tough
they
claim
it
is
well
you
seen
much
fightin
three
years
is
it
true
that
the
heinies
his
hands
indicated
his
question
sometimes
accidentally
more
or
less
you
ca
help
it
and
do
them
machine
guns
really
mow
down
hugo
shrugged
there
are
only
four
men
in
service
now
who
started
with
my
company
ouch
encore
an
tell
him
to
make
it
double
no
triple
dan
old
man
it
may
be
my
last
to
hugo
well
it
about
time
we
got
here
an
took
the
war
off
your
shoulders
you
guys
sure
have
had
a
bellyful
an
i
goin
to
get
me
one
right
here
and
now
bottoms
up
you
guys
hugo
was
transferred
to
an
american
unit
the
officers
belittled
the
recommendations
that
came
with
him
they
put
him
in
the
ranks
he
served
behind
the
lines
for
a
week
then
his
regiment
moved
up
as
soon
as
the
guns
began
to
rumble
a
nervous
second
lieutenant
edged
toward
the
demoted
private
say
danner
you
been
in
this
before
do
you
think
it
all
right
to
keep
on
along
this
road
the
way
we
are
i
sure
i
could
say
you
taking
a
chance
plane
strafing
and
shells
well
what
else
are
we
to
do
these
are
our
orders
nothing
hugo
said
when
the
first
shells
fell
among
them
however
danner
forgot
that
his
transference
had
cost
his
commission
and
sadly
bereft
captain
crouan
and
his
command
he
forgot
his
repressed
anger
at
the
stupidity
of
american
headquarters
and
their
bland
assumption
of
knowledge
superior
to
that
gained
by
three
years
of
actual
fighting
he
virtually
took
charge
of
his
company
ignoring
the
bickering
of
a
lieutenant
who
swore
and
shouted
and
accomplished
nothing
and
who
was
presently
beheaded
for
his
lack
of
caution
a
month
later
with
troops
that
had
some
feeling
of
respect
for
the
enemy
a
feeling
gained
through
close
and
gory
association
hugo
was
returned
his
commission
slowly
at
first
and
with
increasing
momentum
the
war
was
pushed
up
out
of
the
trenches
and
the
germans
retreated
the
summer
that
filled
the
windows
of
american
homes
with
gold
stars
passed
hugo
worked
like
a
slave
out
beyond
the
front
trenches
scouting
spying
destroying
salvaging
bending
his
heart
and
shoulders
to
a
task
that
had
long
since
become
an
acid
routine
september
october
november
the
end
of
that
holocaust
was
very
near
then
there
came
a
day
warmer
than
the
rest
and
less
rainy
hugo
was
riding
toward
the
lines
on
a
he
rode
as
much
as
possible
now
he
had
not
slept
for
two
days
his
eyes
were
red
and
twitching
he
felt
tired
tired
as
if
his
fatigue
were
the
beginning
of
death
tired
so
that
nothing
counted
or
mattered
tired
of
killing
of
hating
of
suffering
tired
even
of
an
ideal
that
had
tarnished
through
long
weathering
the
was
steel
and
it
rattled
and
bumped
as
it
moved
over
the
road
hugo
lay
flat
in
it
trying
to
close
his
eyes
after
a
time
moving
between
the
stumps
of
a
row
of
poplars
they
came
abreast
of
a
regiment
returning
from
the
battle
they
walked
slowly
and
dazedly
each
individual
was
still
amazed
at
being
alive
after
the
things
he
had
witnessed
hugo
raised
himself
and
looked
at
them
the
same
expression
had
often
been
on
the
faces
of
the
french
the
long
line
of
the
regiment
ended
then
there
was
an
empty
place
on
the
road
and
the
speed
of
the
truck
increased
finally
it
stopped
with
a
sharp
jar
and
the
driver
shouted
that
he
could
go
no
farther
hugo
clambered
to
the
ground
he
estimated
that
the
battery
toward
which
he
was
travelling
was
a
mile
farther
he
began
to
walk
there
was
none
of
the
former
lunge
and
stride
in
his
steps
he
trudged
rather
his
head
bent
forward
a
little
file
of
men
approached
him
and
even
at
a
distance
he
did
not
need
a
second
glance
to
identify
them
walking
wounded
by
ones
and
twos
they
began
to
pass
him
he
paid
scant
attention
their
field
dressings
were
stained
with
the
blood
that
their
progress
cost
they
cursed
and
muttered
someone
had
given
them
cigarettes
and
a
dozen
wisps
of
smoke
rose
from
each
group
it
was
not
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
straggling
line
that
he
looked
up
then
he
saw
one
man
whose
arms
were
both
under
bandage
walking
with
another
whose
eyes
were
covered
and
whose
hand
resting
on
his
companion
shoulder
guided
his
stumbling
feet
hugo
viewed
them
as
they
came
on
and
presently
heard
their
conversation
christ
it
hurts
one
of
them
said
the
devil
with
hurting
boy
the
blinded
man
answered
so
do
i
for
that
matter
i
feel
like
there
was
a
hot
poker
in
my
brains
want
another
butt
no
thanks
makes
me
kind
of
sick
to
drag
on
them
wish
i
had
a
drink
though
who
does
hugo
heard
his
voice
hey
you
guys
it
said
here
some
water
and
a
shot
of
cognac
too
the
first
man
stopped
and
the
blind
man
ran
into
him
bumping
his
head
he
gasped
with
pain
but
his
lips
smiled
damn
nice
of
you
whoever
you
are
they
took
the
canteen
and
swallowed
go
on
hugo
said
and
permitted
himself
a
small
lie
i
can
get
more
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
produced
his
flask
and
finish
off
on
a
shot
of
this
he
held
the
containers
for
the
armless
man
and
handed
them
to
the
other
their
clothes
were
ragged
and
stained
their
shoes
were
in
pieces
sweat
had
soaked
under
the
blind
man
armpits
and
stained
his
tunic
as
hugo
watched
him
swallow
thirstily
he
started
the
chin
and
the
hair
were
familiar
his
mind
spun
he
knew
the
voice
although
its
tenor
was
sadly
changed
good
god
he
said
involuntarily
it
lefty
lefty
stiffened
who
are
you
hugo
danner
hugo
danner
the
tortured
brain
reflected
hugo
good
old
hugo
what
in
the
name
of
jesus
are
you
doing
here
same
thing
you
are
an
odd
silence
fell
the
man
with
the
shattered
arms
broke
it

fellow
do
i
know
him
gee
he
was
at
college
with
me

of
my
buddies
gosh
his
hand
reached
out

it
there
hugo
they
shook
hands
got
it
bad
lefty
the
bound
head
shook
not
so
bad
i
guess
i
kind
of
feel
that
i
be
able
to
see
much
any
more
eyes
all
washed
out
got
mustard
gas
in
but
i
be
all
right
you
know
a
little
thing
like
nothing
glad
to
be
alive
still
have
my
sex
appeal
anyhow
still
got
the
old
appetite
but
listen
what
happened
to
you
why
in
hell
did
you
quit
woodman
nearly
went
crazy
looking
for
you
oh
hugo
thoughts
went
back
a
distance
that
seemed
infinite
into
another
epoch
and
another
world
oh
i
just
could
stick
it
say
you
guys
wait
a
minute
he
turned
his
was
lingering
in
the
distance
wait
here
he
rushed
back
the
armless
man
whistled
god
in
heaven
your
friend
there
can
sure
cover
the
ground
yeah
lefty
said
absently
he
always
could
in
a
moment
hugo
returned
i
got
it
all
fixed
up
for
you
two
to
ride
in
no
limousine
but
it
carry
you
lefty
lip
trembled
gee
jesus
christ
he
amended
stubbornly
that
decent
i
do
feel
so
dusty
damn
it
if
i
had
any
eyes
i
guess
i
cry
must
be
the
cognac
nothing
at
all
lefty
old
kid
here
i
give
you
a
hand
he
took
lefty
arm
over
his
shoulder
encircled
him
with
his
own
and
carried
him
rapidly
over
the
broken
road
still
got
the
old
fight
lefty
murmured
as
he
felt
himself
rushed
forward
still
been
in
this
mess
long
since
the
beginning
i
should
have
thought
of
that
i
often
wondered
what
became
of
you
iris
used
to
wonder
too
how
is
she
all
right
they
reached
the
truck
lefty
sat
down
on
the
metal
bottom
with
a
sigh
thanks
old
bean
i
was
just
about
tough
going
this
war
i
saw
my
first
shell
fall
yesterday
never
saw
a
single
german
at
all
one
of
those
squdgy
things
came
across
and
before
i
knew
it
there
was
onion
in
my
eye
for
a
goal
the
truck
motor
roared
the
armless
man
came
alongside
and
was
lifted
beside
lefty
well
hugo
so
long
you
sure
were
a
friend
in
need
never
forget
it
and
look
me
up
when
the
krauts
are
all
dead
will
you
the
gears
clashed
thanks
again
and
for
the
cognac
too
he
waved
airily
see
you
later
hugo
stalked
back
on
the
road
once
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
truck
was
a
blur
of
dust
see
you
later
see
you
later
see
you
later
lefty
would
never
see
him
later
never
see
anyone
ever
that
night
he
sat
in
a
quiet
stupor
all
thought
of
great
ideal
of
fine
abandon
of
the
fury
of
justice
and
all
flagrant
phrases
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
by
the
immediate
claims
of
his
own
sorrow
tom
shayne
was
blasted
to
death
the
stinging
horror
of
mustard
had
fallen
into
eyes
all
the
young
men
were
dying
the
friendships
he
had
made
the
human
things
that
gave
in
memory
root
to
the
earth
were
ripped
up
and
shrivelled
that
seemed
grossly
wrong
and
patently
ignoble
he
discarded
his
personal
travail
it
was
nothing
his
life
had
been
comprised
of
attempt
and
failure
of
disappointment
and
misunderstanding
he
was
accustomed
to
witness
the
blunting
of
the
edge
of
his
hopes
and
the
dulling
of
his
desires
when
they
were
enacted
even
his
great
sacrifice
had
been
vain
it
was
always
thus
his
deeds
frightened
men
or
made
them
jealous
when
he
conceived
a
fine
thing
the
masses
individually
or
collectively
transformed
it
into
something
cheap
his
fort
in
the
forest
had
been
branded
a
hoax
his
effort
to
send
himself
through
college
and
to
rescue
charlotte
from
an
unpleasant
life
had
ended
in
vulgar
comedy
even
that
had
been
her
triumph
her
hour
and
an
incongruous
strain
of
greatness
had
filtered
through
her
personality
rather
than
his
now
his
years
in
the
war
were
reduced
to
no
grandeur
to
a
mere
outlet
for
his
savage
instinct
to
destroy
after
such
a
life
he
reflected
he
could
no
longer
visualize
himself
engaged
in
any
search
for
a
comprehension
of
real
values
his
mind
was
thorny
with
doubts
seeing
himself
as
a
man
made
hypocritical
by
his
gifts
and
the
narrowness
of
the
world
discarding
his
own
problem
as
tragically
solved
hugo
then
looked
upon
the
war
as
the
same
sort
of
colossal
error
a
waste
useless
hopeless
gaining
nothing
but
the
temporal
power
which
it
so
blatantly
disavowed
it
had
exacted
the
price
of
its
tawdry
excitement
in
lives
and
now
that
it
was
almost
finished
mankind
was
ready
to
emerge
and
panting
no
better
off
than
before
his
heart
ached
as
he
thought
of
the
toil
the
effort
the
energy
and
hope
and
courage
that
had
been
spilled
over
those
mucky
fields
to
satisfy
the
lusts
and
foolish
hates
of
the
demagogues
he
was
no
longer
angry
the
memory
of
lefty
sitting
smilingly
on
the
van
and
calling
that
he
would
see
him
later
was
too
sharp
an
emotion
to
permit
brain
storms
and
pyrotechnics
if
he
could
but
have
ended
the
war
it
might
have
been
different
but
he
was
not
great
enough
for
that
he
had
been
a
thousand
men
perhaps
ten
thousand
but
he
could
not
be
millions
he
could
not
wrap
his
arms
around
a
continent
and
squeeze
it
into
submission
there
were
too
many
people
and
they
were
too
stupid
to
do
more
than
fear
him
and
hate
him
sitting
there
he
realized
that
his
naïve
faith
in
himself
and
the
universe
had
foundered
the
war
was
only
another
war
that
future
generations
would
find
romantic
to
contemplate
and
dull
to
study
he
was
only
a
species
of
genius
who
had
missed
his
mark
by
a
cosmic
margin
when
he
considered
his
failure
he
believed
that
he
was
not
thinking
about
himself
there
he
was
entrusted
with
special
missions
which
he
accomplished
no
one
knew
how
and
no
one
questioned
in
those
hectic
days
those
who
had
seen
him
escape
fire
carry
tons
leap
a
hundred
yards
kill
scores
still
clung
to
their
original
concepts
of
mankind
and
discredited
the
miracle
their
own
eyes
had
witnessed
too
many
strange
things
happened
in
that
blasting
carnival
of
destruction
for
one
strange
sight
or
one
strange
man
to
leave
a
great
mark
personal
security
was
at
too
great
a
premium
to
leave
much
room
for
interest
and
speculation
even
captain
crouan
believed
he
was
only
a
man
of
freak
strength
and
major
ingalls
in
his
present
situation
was
too
busy
to
do
more
than
note
that
hugo
was
capable
and
nod
his
head
when
hugo
reported
another
signal
victory
ascribing
it
to
his
long
experience
in
the
war
rather
than
to
his
peculiar
abilities
as
he
sat
in
the
darkness
smoking
cigarettes
and
breathing
in
his
own
and
the
world
tragic
futility
his
own
and
the
abysmal
sorrow
that
stubborn
ancestral
courage
and
determination
that
was
in
him
still
continued
to
lash
his
reason
even
if
the
war
is
not
worth
while
it
whispered
you
have
committed
yourself
to
it
you
are
bound
and
pledged
to
see
it
to
the
bitter
end
you
can
not
finish
it
on
a
declining
note
you
must
begin
again
at
the
same
time
his
lust
for
carnage
stirred
within
him
like
a
demon
now
he
recognized
it
and
knew
that
it
must
be
mastered
but
it
combined
with
his
conscience
to
quicken
his
sinews
anew
it
was
a
cold
night
but
hugo
perspired
was
he
to
go
again
into
the
holocaust
to
avenge
a
friend
was
he
to
live
over
those
crimson
seconds
that
followed
the
death
of
shayne
all
because
he
had
helped
a
blind
friend
into
a
he
knew
that
he
was
not
never
again
could
his
instinct
so
triumph
over
his
reason
that
was
the
greatest
danger
in
being
hugo
danner
that
he
commenced
to
see
was
the
explanation
of
all
his
suffering
in
the
past
the
idea
warmed
and
encouraged
him
henceforth
his
emotions
and
sentiments
would
be
buried
even
deeper
than
his
first
inbred
caution
had
buried
them
he
would
be
a
creature
of
intelligence
master
of
his
caprice
as
well
as
of
the
power
he
possessed
to
carry
out
that
caprice
he
lit
a
fresh
cigarette
and
planned
what
he
would
do
on
the
next
night
he
would
prepare
himself
very
carefully
he
would
eat
enormously
provide
himself
with
food
and
water
rest
as
much
as
he
could
and
then
start
south
and
east
in
a
plane
he
would
drive
it
far
into
germany
when
its
petrol
failed
he
would
crash
it
stepping
from
the
ruins
he
would
hasten
on
in
the
darkness
on
on
like
pheidippides
till
he
reached
the
centre
of
the
enemy
government
there
crashing
through
the
petty
human
barriers
he
would
perform
his
last
feat
strangling
the
emperor
slaying
the
generals
pulling
the
buildings
apart
with
his
samsonian
arms
and
disrupting
the
control
of
the
war
he
had
dreamed
of
such
an
enterprise
even
before
he
had
enlisted
but
he
had
known
that
he
lacked
sufficient
stamina
without
a
great
internal
cause
and
no
rage
no
was
great
enough
to
drive
him
to
that
effort
with
amazement
he
realized
that
a
clenched
determination
depending
on
the
brain
rather
than
the
emotions
was
a
greater
catalyst
than
any
passion
he
knew
that
he
could
do
such
a
thing
in
the
warmth
of
that
knowledge
he
completed
his
plan
tranquilly
and
retired
for
twelve
hours
by
order
undisturbed
hugo
slept
in
the
bright
morning
he
girded
himself
he
requisitioned
the
plane
he
needed
through
major
ingalls
he
explained
that
requirement
by
saying
that
he
was
going
to
bomb
a
battery
of
big
guns
the
plane
offered
was
an
old
one
hugo
had
seen
enough
of
flying
in
his
french
service
to
understand
its
navigation
he
ate
the
huge
meal
he
had
planned
and
then
a
cool
and
grim
man
he
made
his
way
to
the
hangar
in
fifteen
minutes
his
last
adventure
would
have
commenced
but
a
dispatch
rider
charging
on
to
the
field
in
a
roaring
motor
cycle
announced
the
signing
of
the
armistice
and
the
end
of
the
war
hugo
stood
near
his
plane
when
he
heard
the
news
two
men
at
his
side
began
to
cry
one
repeating
over
and
over
and
i
still
alive
so
help
me
god
i
wish
i
was
dead
like
joey
hugo
was
rigid
his
first
gesture
was
to
lift
his
clenched
fist
and
search
for
an
object
to
smash
with
it
the
fist
lingered
in
the
air
his
rage
passed
rage
that
would
have
required
a
giant
vent
had
it
occurred
two
days
sooner
he
relaxed
his
arm
fell
he
ruffled
his
black
hair
his
blacker
eyes
stared
and
then
twinkled
his
lips
smiled
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
his
great
shoulders
sagged
i
should
have
guessed
it
he
said
to
himself
and
entered
the
rejoicing
with
a
fervour
that
was
unexpected
xvi
there
must
be
in
heaven
a
certain
god
a
paunchy
cynical
god
whose
task
it
is
to
arrange
for
each
of
the
souls
a
set
of
circumstances
so
nicely
adjusted
to
its
character
that
the
result
of
its
life
in
triumph
or
defeat
will
be
hinged
on
the
finest
of
threads
so
hugo
must
have
felt
coming
home
from
war
he
had
celebrated
the
armistice
hugely
not
because
it
had
spared
his
life
most
of
the
pomp
parade
bawdiness
and
glory
had
originated
in
such
a
deliverance
but
because
it
had
rescued
him
from
the
hot
blast
of
destructiveness
an
instantaneous
realization
of
that
prevented
despair
he
had
failed
in
the
hour
of
becoming
death
itself
such
failure
was
fortunate
because
life
to
him
even
at
the
end
of
the
war
seemed
more
the
effort
of
creation
than
the
business
of
annihilation
to
know
that
had
cost
a
struggle
a
struggle
that
took
place
at
the
hangar
as
the
rode
up
and
that
remained
crucial
only
between
the
instant
when
he
lifted
his
fist
and
when
he
lowered
it
brevity
made
it
no
less
intense
a
second
of
time
had
resolved
his
soul
afresh
had
redistilled
it
and
recombined
it
not
long
after
that
he
started
back
to
america
the
mass
of
soldiers
surrounding
him
were
undergoing
a
transition
that
hugo
felt
vividly
these
men
would
wake
up
sweating
at
night
and
cry
out
until
someone
whispered
roughly
that
there
were
no
more
submarines
a
door
would
slam
and
one
of
them
would
begin
to
weep
there
were
whisperings
and
bickerings
about
life
at
home
about
what
each
person
disintegrated
again
to
individuality
would
do
and
say
and
think
little
fears
about
lost
jobs
and
lost
girls
cropped
out
were
thrust
back
came
finally
to
remain
and
no
one
wanted
life
to
be
what
it
had
been
no
one
considered
that
it
could
be
the
same
hugo
wrote
to
his
family
that
the
war
was
ended
that
he
was
well
that
he
expected
to
see
them
some
time
in
the
near
future
the
ship
that
carried
him
reached
the
end
of
the
blue
sea
he
was
disembarked
and
demobilized
in
new
york
he
realized
even
before
he
was
accustomed
to
the
novelty
of
civilian
clothes
that
a
familiar
friendly
city
had
changed
the
retrospective
spell
of
the
eighties
and
nineties
had
vanished
new
york
was
blatant
rushing
prosperous
the
inheritance
from
europe
had
been
assimilated
a
social
reality
entirely
foreign
and
american
had
been
wrought
and
new
york
was
ready
to
spread
it
across
the
parent
world
those
things
were
pressed
quickly
into
hugo
mind
by
his
hotel
the
magazines
a
chance
novel
of
the
precise
date
the
cinema
and
the
more
general
more
indefinite
human
pulses
after
a
few
days
of
random
inspection
of
casual
imbibing
he
called
upon
tom
shayne
father
he
would
have
preferred
to
escape
all
painful
reminiscing
but
he
went
partly
as
a
duty
and
partly
from
necessity
he
had
no
money
whatever
a
butler
opened
the
door
of
a
large
stone
mansion
and
ushered
hugo
to
the
library
where
shayne
rose
eagerly
i
so
glad
you
came
knew
you
be
here
soon
how
are
you
hugo
was
slightly
surprised
in
his
host
manner
was
the
hardness
and
intensity
that
he
had
observed
everywhere
i
very
well
thanks
splendid
cocktails
smith
there
was
a
pause
shayne
smiled
well
it
over
eh
yes
all
over
and
now
we
got
to
beat
the
spears
into
plowshares
eh
we
have
shayne
chuckled
some
of
my
spears
were
already
made
into
plows
and
it
was
a
great
season
for
the
harvest
young
man
a
great
season
hugo
was
still
uncertain
of
shayne
deepest
viewpoint
his
uncertainty
nettled
him
the
grim
reaper
has
done
some
harvesting
on
his
own
account
he
spoke
almost
rudely
shayne
frowned
disapprovingly
i
made
up
my
mind
to
forget
danner
to
forget
and
to
buckle
down
and
i
done
both
you
want
to
know
what
happened
to
the
funds
i
handled
for
you
i
was
particularly
the
older
man
shook
his
head
with
grotesque
coyness
not
so
fast
not
so
fast
you
were
particularly
eager
to
hear
we
getting
honest
about
our
emotions
in
this
day
and
place
you
eaten
with
impatience
well
i
wo
hold
out
danner
i
made
you
a
million
a
clean
cold
million
hugo
had
been
struggling
in
a
rising
tide
of
incomprehension
that
statement
engulfed
him
me
a
million
in
the
bank
in
your
name
waiting
for
a
blonde
girl
i
afraid
i
do
exactly
understand
mr
shayne
the
banker
readjusted
his
glasses
and
swallowed
a
cocktail
by
tipping
back
his
head
then
he
rose
paced
across
the
broad
carpet
and
faced
hugo
of
course
you
do
understand
well
i
tell
you
about
it
once
you
did
a
favour
for
me
which
has
no
place
in
this
conversation
he
hesitated
his
face
seemed
to
flinch
and
then
to
be
jerked
back
to
its
former
expression
in
return
i
done
a
little
for
you
and
i
want
to
add
a
word
to
the
gift
of
your
bank
book
you
have
if
careful
leisure
to
enjoy
life
freedom
the
world
at
your
feet
no
more
strife
for
you
no
worry
and
no
care
take
it
be
a
hedonist
there
is
nothing
else
i
lain
in
bed
nights
enjoying
the
life
that
lies
ahead
of
you
my
boy
vicariously
voluptuous
catchy
phrase
it
my
own
i
want
to
see
you
do
it
up
brown
hugo
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
it
was
not
long
ago
that
this
same
man
had
sat
at
an
and
wept
over
snatches
of
a
childhood
which
death
had
made
sacred
here
he
stood
now
asking
that
a
life
be
done
up
brown
and
meaning
cheap
obvious
things
he
wished
that
he
had
never
called
on
tom
father
that
was
my
idea
of
living
he
said
slowly
it
will
be
forget
the
war
it
was
a
dream
i
realized
it
suddenly
if
i
had
not
i
would
still
be
just
a
banker
not
a
great
banker
the
great
banker
i
saw
suddenly
that
it
was
a
dream
the
world
was
mad
so
i
took
my
profit
from
it
beginning
on
the
day
i
saw
how
exactly
eh
i
mean
how
did
you
profit
by
the
war
shayne
smiled
expansively
what
was
in
demand
then
my
boy
what
were
the
stupid
traduced
misguided
people
raising
billions
to
get
what
why
shells
guns
foodstuffs
for
six
months
i
had
a
corner
on
four
chemicals
vitally
necessary
to
the
government
and
the
government
got
them
at
my
price
i
owned
a
lot
of
steel
i
mixed
food
and
diplomacy
in
equal
parts
and
when
the
pie
was
opened
it
was
full
of
solid
gold
hugo
voice
was
strange
and
that
is
the
way
my
money
was
made
it
is
shayne
perceived
that
hugo
was
angry
now
do
get
sentimental
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
i
he
did
not
finish
because
shayne
came
into
the
room
hugo
stared
at
him
fixedly
his
face
livid
for
several
seconds
before
he
was
conscious
of
her
even
then
it
was
only
a
partial
consciousness
she
was
stuffed
into
a
tight
bright
dress
she
was
holding
out
her
hand
holding
his
hand
holding
his
hand
too
long
there
was
mascara
around
her
eyes
and
they
dilated
and
blinked
in
a
foolish
and
flirtatious
way
her
voice
was
syrup
she
was
taking
a
cocktail
with
the
other
hand
maybe
if
he
gave
her
hand
a
real
squeeze
she
would
let
go
a
tall
sallow
young
man
had
come
in
behind
her
he
was
jerome
leonardo
bateau
a
perfect
dear
shayne
was
still
holding
his
hand
and
murmuring
shayne
was
patting
his
shoulder
bateau
was
staring
with
haughty
and
jealous
eyes
hugo
excused
himself
in
the
hall
he
asked
for
shayne
secretary
he
collected
himself
in
a
few
frigid
sentences
please
tell
shayne
i
am
very
grateful
i
wish
to
transfer
my
entire
fortune
to
my
parents
in
indian
creek
colorado
the
name
is
abednego
danner
make
all
arrangements
a
faint
but
followed
him
futilely
through
the
door
in
the
space
of
a
block
he
had
cut
a
pace
that
set
other
pedestrians
gaping
to
a
fast
walk
xvii
hugo
sat
in
madison
square
park
giving
his
attention
in
a
circuit
to
the
flatiron
building
the
clock
on
the
metropolitan
tower
and
the
creeping
barrage
of
traffic
that
sent
people
scampering
stopped
moved
forward
again
he
had
sat
on
the
identical
bench
at
the
identical
time
of
day
during
his
obscure
undergraduate
period
to
repeat
that
contemplative
stasis
after
so
much
living
had
intervened
ought
to
have
produced
an
emotion
he
had
gone
to
the
park
with
that
idea
but
the
febrile
fires
of
feeling
were
banked
under
the
weight
of
many
things
and
he
could
suffer
nothing
enjoy
nothing
and
think
but
one
fragmentary
routine
he
had
tried
much
and
made
no
progress
he
would
be
forced
presently
to
depart
on
a
different
course
from
a
new
threshold
that
idea
went
round
and
round
in
his
head
like
a
single
fly
in
a
big
room
it
lost
poignancy
and
eventually
it
lost
meaning
still
he
sat
in
feeble
sunshine
trying
to
move
beyond
stagnancy
he
remembered
the
small
man
with
the
huge
roll
of
bills
who
had
moved
beside
him
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
coffee
he
remembered
the
woman
who
had
robbed
him
silk
ankles
crossed
his
line
of
vision
and
a
gusty
appetite
vaporized
even
as
it
steamed
into
the
coldness
of
his
indecision
he
was
without
money
now
as
he
had
been
then
so
long
ago
he
budged
on
the
bench
and
challenged
himself
to
think
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
the
strongest
thing
in
the
world
mightier
than
the
machine
he
made
himself
guess
answers
for
that
rhetorical
query
i
would
i
would
have
won
the
war
but
i
did
not
i
would
run
the
universe
literally
i
would
scorn
the
universe
and
turn
it
to
my
own
ends
i
would
be
a
criminal
i
would
rip
open
banks
and
gut
them
i
would
kill
and
destroy
i
would
be
a
secret
invisible
blight
i
would
set
out
to
stamp
crime
off
the
earth
i
would
be
a
following
and
summarily
punishing
every
criminal
until
no
one
dared
to
commit
a
felony
what
would
i
do
what
will
i
do
then
he
realized
that
he
was
hungry
he
had
not
eaten
enough
in
the
last
few
days
enough
for
him
with
some
intention
of
finding
work
he
had
left
shayne
house
a
call
on
the
telephone
from
shayne
himself
volunteering
a
position
had
crystallized
that
intention
in
three
days
he
had
discovered
the
vast
abundance
of
young
men
the
embarrassment
of
young
men
who
were
walking
along
the
streets
looking
for
work
he
who
had
always
worked
with
his
arms
and
shoulders
had
determined
to
try
to
earn
his
living
with
his
head
but
the
ranks
were
teeming
overflowing
supersaturated
he
went
down
in
the
scale
of
clerkships
and
inexperienced
clerkships
there
was
no
work
thence
he
had
gone
to
the
park
and
presently
he
rose
he
had
seen
the
clusters
of
men
on
sixth
avenue
standing
outside
the
employment
agencies
he
could
go
there
any
employment
was
better
than
hunger
and
he
had
learned
that
hunger
could
come
swiftly
and
formidably
to
him
business
was
slack
hands
were
being
laid
off
where
an
apprentice
was
required
three
trained
men
waited
avidly
for
work
it
was
appalling
and
hugo
saw
it
as
appalling
he
was
not
frightened
but
as
he
walked
he
knew
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
sit
in
the
park
with
the
myriad
other
men
walking
made
him
feel
better
it
was
action
it
bred
the
thought
that
any
work
was
better
than
none
work
would
not
hinder
his
dreams
meantime
when
he
reached
street
he
could
see
the
sullen
watchful
groups
of
men
he
joined
one
of
them
a
person
came
down
a
flight
of
stairs
wrote
on
a
blackboard
in
chalk
and
went
up
again
several
of
the
group
detached
themselves
and
followed
him
to
compete
for
a
chance
to
wash
windows
a
man
at
his
side
spoke
to
him
tough
ai
it
buddy
yeah
it
tough
hugo
said
i
got
three
bones
left
wan
na
join
me
in
a
feed
an
get
a
job
afterward
hugo
looked
into
his
eyes
they
were
troubled
and
desirous
of
companionship
no
thanks
he
replied
they
waited
for
the
man
to
scribble
again
in
chalk
they
was
goin
to
fix
up
everybody
slick
after
the
war
oh
hell
yes

it
hugo
asked

my
neck
buddy

guess

they
waited
a
moment
longer
for
the
man
with
the
chalk
had
reappeared
hugo
comrade
grunted
wash
windows
an
work
in
the
steel
mills

or

ear

wha

hugo
had
taken
a
step
toward
the
door
but
the
youth
with
the
troubled
eyes
caught
his
sleeve

loosened
himself
got

buddy
i
do
happen
to
have
even
three
bones
available
at
the
moment
the
man
looked
after
him
gosh
he
murmured
even
guys
like
that
he
was
in
a
dingy
room
standing
before
a
grilled
window
a
voice
from
behind
it
asked
his
name
age
address
war
record
hugo
was
handed
a
piece
of
paper
to
sign
and
then
a
second
piece
that
bore
the
scrawled
words
amalgamated
crucible
steel
harrison
n
j
hugo
emotional
life
was
reawakened
when
he
walked
into
the
mills
his
last
nickel
was
gone
he
had
left
the
train
at
the
wrong
station
and
walked
more
than
a
mile
he
was
hungry
and
cold
he
came
as
if
naked
to
the
monster
and
he
did
it
homage
its
predominant
colour
scheme
was
black
and
red
it
had
a
loud
pagan
voice
it
breathed
fire
it
melted
steel
and
rock
and
drank
human
sweat
with
human
blood
for
an
occasional
stimulant
on
every
side
of
him
were
enormous
buildings
and
woven
between
them
a
plaid
of
girders
cables
and
tracks
across
which
masses
of
machinery
moved
inside
thor
was
hammering
inside
a
crane
sped
overhead
like
a
tarantula
trailing
its
viscera
to
the
floor
dangling
a
gigantic
iron
rib
a
white
speck
in
its
wounded
abdomen
was
a
human
face
the
bright
metal
gushed
from
another
hole
it
was
livid
and
partially
alive
it
was
hot
and
had
a
smell
it
swept
away
the
thought
of
the
dark
descending
night
it
made
a
pool
in
a
great
ladle
it
made
a
cupful
dipped
from
a
river
in
hell
a
furnace
exhaled
sulphurously
darting
a
snake
tongue
into
the
sky
the
mills
roared
and
the
earth
shook
it
was
bestial
reptilian
labour
and
the
labour
of
creation
and
the
engine
that
turned
the
earth
could
be
no
more
terrible
hugo
standing
sublimely
small
in
its
midst
measured
his
strength
against
it
soaked
up
its
warmth
shook
his
fist
at
it
and
shouted
in
a
voice
that
could
not
be
heard
for
a
foot
christ
almighty
this
is
something
name
hugo
danner
address
none
at
present
experience
none
married
no
union
what
lem
me
see
your
union
card
i
do
belong
well
you
got
ta
join
he
went
to
the
headquarters
of
the
union
men
were
there
of
all
sorts
the
mills
were
taking
on
hands
there
was
reconstruction
to
be
done
abroad
and
steel
was
needed
they
came
from
europe
for
the
most
part
thickset
men
men
with
expressionless
faces
and
bulging
muscles
that
held
more
meaning
than
most
countenances
they
gave
him
room
and
no
more
they
answered
the
same
questions
that
he
answered
he
stood
in
a
third
queue
with
them
belly
to
back
mouths
closed
he
was
sent
to
a
advanced
five
dollars
and
told
that
he
would
be
boarded
and
given
a
bed
and
no
more
until
the
employment
agency
had
taken
its
commission
and
the
union
its
dues
he
signed
a
paper
he
went
on
the
night
shift
without
supper
he
ran
a
wheelbarrow
filled
with
heavy
warm
slag
for
a
hundred
feet
over
a
walk
of
loose
bricks
the
job
was
simple
load
carry
dump
return
load
on
some
later
night
he
would
count
the
number
of
loads
but
on
this
first
night
he
walked
with
excited
eyes
watching
the
tremendous
things
that
happened
all
around
him
men
ran
the
machinery
that
dumped
the
ladle
men
guided
liquid
iron
from
the
furnaces
into
a
maze
of
channels
and
cloughs
clearing
the
way
through
the
sand
cutting
off
the
stream
making
new
openings
men
wheeled
the
slag
and
steered
the
trains
and
trams
and
cranes
men
operated
the
hammers
and
almost
all
of
the
men
were
nude
to
the
waist
sleek
and
shining
with
sweat
almost
all
of
them
drank
whisky
one
of
the
men
in
the
wheelbarrow
line
even
offered
a
drink
to
hugo
he
held
out
the
flask
and
bellowed
in
czech
hugo
took
it
the
drink
was
raw
and
foul
pouring
into
his
empty
stomach
it
had
a
powerful
effect
making
him
exalted
making
him
work
like
a
demon
after
a
long
noisy
time
that
did
not
seem
long
a
steam
whistle
screamed
faintly
and
the
shift
was
ended
the
czech
accompanied
hugo
through
the
door
the
new
shift
was
already
at
work
they
went
out
a
nightmare
of
brilliant
orange
and
black
fled
from
hugo
vision
and
he
looked
into
the
pale
remote
chiaroscuro
of
dawn
me
tired
the
czech
said
in
a
small
aimless
tone
they
flung
themselves
on
dirty
beds
in
a
big
room
but
hugo
did
not
sleep
for
a
time
not
until
the
sun
rose
and
day
was
evident
in
the
grimy
interior
of
the
bunk
house
that
he
could
think
while
he
worked
had
been
hugo
thesis
when
he
walked
up
sixth
avenue
now
working
steadily
working
at
a
thing
that
was
hard
for
other
men
and
easy
for
him
he
nevertheless
fell
into
the
stolid
vacuum
of
the
manual
labourer
the
mills
became
familiar
less
fantastic
he
remembered
that
oftentimes
the
war
had
given
a
more
dramatic
passage
of
man
imagination
forged
into
fire
and
steel
his
task
was
changed
numerous
times
for
a
while
he
puddled
pig
iron
with
the
tool
do
slip
in
they
said
it
was
succinct
graphic
then
they
put
him
on
the
hand
cars
that
fed
the
furnaces
it
was
picturesque
daring
and
for
most
men
too
hard
few
could
manage
the
weight
or
keep
up
with
the
pace
those
who
did
were
honoured
by
their
fellows
the
trucks
were
moved
forward
by
human
strength
and
dumped
by
occasionally
they
said
you
became
tired
and
fell
into
the
furnace
or
jumped
if
you
got
feeling
woozy
they
said
quit
the
high
rails
and
red
mouths
were
hypnotic
like
burning
baal
and
the
juggernaut
hugo
problems
had
been
abandoned
he
worked
as
hard
as
he
dared
the
presence
of
grandeur
and
din
made
him
content
how
long
it
would
have
lasted
is
uncertain
not
forever
on
the
day
when
he
had
pushed
up
two
hundred
and
three
loads
during
his
shift
the
boss
stopped
him
in
the
yard
a
tall
lean
acid
man
he
caught
hugo
sleeve
and
turned
him
round
you
one
of
the
bastards
on
the
furnace
line
yes
how
many
cars
did
you
push
up
two
hundred
and
three
what
the
hell
do
you
think
this
is
anyway
i
do
get
you
oh
you
do
huh
well
listen
here
you
athlete
what
are
you
trying
to
do
you
got
the
men
all
sore
wearing
themselves
out
i
had
to
lay
off
three
why
because
they
could
keep
up
with
you
that
why
because
they
got
their
guts
in
a
snarl
trying
to
bust
your
record
what
do
you
think
you
in
a
race
somebody
got
to
show
you
your
place
around
here
and
i
think
i
just
kick
a
lung
out
right
now
the
boss
had
worked
himself
into
a
fury
he
became
conscious
of
an
audience
of
workers
hugo
smiled
i
would
advise
you
to
try
that
even
if
you
are
a
big
guy
what
was
that
the
words
were
roared
he
gathered
himself
but
when
hugo
did
not
flinch
did
not
prepare
himself
he
was
suddenly
startled
he
remembered
perhaps
the
two
hundred
and
three
cars
he
opened
his
fist
all
right
i
ai
even
goin
to
bother
myself
tryin
to
break
you
in
to
this
game
get
out
what
get
out
beat
it
i
firing
you
firing
me
for
working
too
hard
hugo
laughed
he
bent
double
with
laughter
his
laughter
sounded
above
the
thunder
of
the
mill
oh
god
that
funny
fire
me
he
moved
toward
the
boss
menacingly
i
a
notion
to
twist
your
liver
around
your
neck
myself
the
workers
realized
that
an
event
of
some
magnitude
was
taking
place
they
drew
nearer
hugo
laughter
came
again
and
changed
into
a
smile
an
emotion
that
cooled
visibly
then
swiftly
he
peeled
up
the
sleeve
of
his
shirt
his
fist
clenched
his
arm
bent
under
the
nose
of
his
boss
he
caused
his
mighty
biceps
to
swell
his
whole
body
trembled
with
his
other
hand
he
took
the
tall
man
fingers
and
laid
them
on
that
muscle
squeeze
he
shouted
the
boss
squeezed
his
face
grew
pallid
and
he
let
go
suddenly
he
tried
to
speak
through
his
dry
mouth
but
hugo
had
turned
his
back
at
the
brick
gate
post
he
paused
and
drew
a
breath
his
words
resounded
like
the
crack
of
doom
so
long
xviii
in
the
next
four
weeks
hugo
knew
the
pangs
of
hunger
frequently
he
found
odd
jobs
but
none
of
them
lasted
once
he
helped
to
remove
a
late
snowstorm
from
the
streets
he
worked
for
five
days
on
a
subway
excavation
his
clothes
became
shabby
he
began
to
carry
his
razor
in
his
overcoat
pocket
and
to
sleep
in
hotels
that
demanded
only
cents
for
a
night
lodging
when
he
considered
the
tens
of
thousands
of
men
in
his
predicament
he
was
not
surprised
at
or
ashamed
of
himself
when
however
he
dwelt
on
his
own
peculiar
capacities
he
was
both
astonished
and
ashamed
to
meander
along
the
dreary
pavements
hunger
did
curious
things
to
him
he
had
moments
of
fury
of
imagined
violence
and
other
moments
of
fantasy
when
he
dreamed
of
a
rich
and
noble
life
sometimes
he
meditated
the
wisdom
of
devouring
one
prodigious
meal
and
fleeing
through
the
dead
of
night
to
the
warm
south
occasionally
he
considered
going
back
to
his
family
in
colorado
his
most
bitter
hours
were
spent
in
thinking
of
shayne
and
of
accepting
a
position
in
one
of
shayne
banks
in
his
maculate
threadbare
clothes
with
his
dark
aquiline
face
matured
by
the
war
he
was
a
sharp
contrast
of
facts
and
possibilities
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
young
that
his
dissatisfaction
his
idealism
his
were
integral
to
the
of
every
man
at
the
end
of
four
weeks
with
hunger
gnawing
so
avidly
at
his
core
that
he
could
not
pass
a
restaurant
without
twitching
muscles
and
quivering
nerves
he
turned
abruptly
from
the
street
into
a
cigar
store
and
telephoned
to
shayne
the
banker
was
full
of
sound
counsel
and
ready
charity
hugo
regretted
the
call
as
soon
as
he
heard
shayne
voice
he
regretted
it
when
he
was
ravishing
a
luxurious
dinner
at
expense
it
was
the
weakest
thing
he
had
done
in
his
life
nevertheless
he
accepted
the
position
offered
by
shayne
that
same
evening
he
rented
a
small
apartment
and
lying
on
his
bed
a
clean
bed
he
wondered
if
he
really
cared
about
anything
or
about
anyone
in
the
morning
he
took
a
shower
and
stood
for
a
long
time
in
front
of
the
mirror
on
the
bathroom
door
staring
at
his
nude
body
as
if
it
were
a
rune
he
might
learn
to
read
an
enigma
he
might
solve
by
concentration
then
he
went
to
work
his
affiliation
with
the
down
town
savings
bank
lasted
into
the
spring
and
was
terminated
by
one
of
the
oddest
incidents
of
his
career
until
the
day
of
that
incident
his
incumbency
was
in
no
way
unusual
he
was
one
of
the
bank
young
men
receiving
fifty
dollars
weekly
to
learn
the
banking
business
they
moved
him
from
department
to
department
giving
him
mentally
menial
tasks
which
afforded
him
in
each
case
a
glimpse
of
a
new
facet
of
financial
technique
it
was
fairly
interesting
he
made
no
friends
and
he
worked
diligently
one
day
in
april
when
he
had
returned
from
lunch
and
a
stroll
in
the
environs
of
the
battery
returned
to
a
list
of
securities
and
a
strip
from
an
adding
machine
which
he
checked
item
by
item
he
was
conscious
of
a
stirring
in
his
vicinity
a
woman
employee
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
wire
wicket
was
talking
shrilly
a
rose
from
his
desk
and
hastened
down
the
corridor
his
usually
composed
face
suddenly
white
and
disconcerted
the
tension
was
cumulative
work
stopped
and
clusters
of
people
began
to
chatter
hugo
joined
one
of
them
yeah
a
boy
was
saying
it
happened
before
a
couple
o
times
how
do
they
know
he
there
they
got
a
telephone
goin
inside
and
they
talkin
to
him
i
be
damned
the
boy
nodded
rapidly
yeah
some
talk
tellin
him
what
to
try
next
poor
devil
what
the
matter
hugo
asked
the
boy
was
glad
of
a
new
and
uninformed
listener
aw
some
dumb
vault
clerk
got
himself
locked
in
an
the
locks
jammed
an
they
ca
get
him
out
which
vault
the
big
one
naw
the
big
one
got
pipes
for
that
kinda
trouble
the
little
one
they
moved
from
the
old
building
it
not
so
darn
little
at
that
someone
said
another
person
a
man
chuckled
not
so
darn
but
there
is
air
in
there
to
last
three
hours
caughlin
said
so
honest
to
god
honest
an
he
been
there
more
than
an
hour
already
jeest
there
was
a
pregnant
pictorial
silence
someone
looked
at
hugo
what
eatin
you
danner
scared
his
face
was
tense
and
his
hands
were
opening
and
closing
convulsively
no
he
answered
guess
i
go
down
and
have
a
look
he
rang
for
an
elevator
in
the
corridor
and
was
carried
to
the
basement
in
the
small
room
on
which
the
vault
opened
were
five
or
six
people
among
them
a
woman
who
seemed
to
command
the
situation
the
men
were
all
smoking
their
attitudes
were
relaxed
their
voices
hushed
one
repeated
nervously
jesus
christ
jesus
christ
jesus
christ
that
wo
help
quail
i
sent
for
the
expert
and
he
will
probably
have
the
safe
open
in
a
short
time
blowtorches
the
swearing
man
asked
abruptly
absurd
he
would
cook
before
he
was
out
and
three
feet
of
steel
and
then
two
feet
more
nitroglycerin
and
make
jelly
out
of
him
the
woman
tapped
her
with
her
glasses
another
arrival
who
carried
a
small
satchel
talked
with
her
in
an
undertone
and
then
took
off
his
coat
he
went
first
to
a
telephone
on
the
wall
and
said
gi
me
the
inside
of
the
vault
hello
hello
you
there
are
you
all
right
try
that
combination
again
the
held
the
wire
and
waited
not
even
the
faintest
sounds
of
the
attempt
were
audible
in
the
front
room
hello
you
tried
it
well
see
if
those
numbers
are
in
this
order
he
repeated
a
series
of
complicated
directions
finally
he
hung
up
says
it
getting
pretty
stuffy
in
there
says
he
lying
down
on
the
floor
people
came
and
went
the
president
himself
walked
in
calmly
and
occupied
a
chair
he
lit
a
cigar
puffed
on
it
and
stared
with
ruminative
eyes
at
the
shiny
mechanism
on
the
front
of
the
safe
we
are
doing
everything
possible
the
woman
said
to
him
crisply
of
course
he
nodded
i
called
up
the
insurance
company
we
amply
covered
a
pause
robinson
post
one
of
the
guards
to
keep
people
from
running
in
and
out
of
here
there
are
enough
around
already
no
one
had
given
hugo
any
attention
he
stood
quietly
in
the
background
the
expert
worked
and
all
eyes
were
on
him
occasionally
he
muttered
to
himself
the
hands
of
an
electric
clock
moved
along
in
audible
jerks
nearly
an
hour
passed
and
the
room
had
become
hazy
with
tobacco
smoke
the
man
working
on
the
safe
was
moist
with
perspiration
his
blue
shirt
was
a
darker
blue
around
the
armpits
he
lit
a
cigarette
set
it
down
whirled
the
dials
again
lit
another
cigarette
while
the
first
one
burned
a
chair
arm
and
threw
a
crumpled
empty
package
on
the
floor
at
last
he
went
to
the
phone
again
he
waited
for
some
time
before
it
was
answered
and
he
was
compelled
to
make
the
man
inside
repeat
frequently
the
new
series
of
stratagems
was
without
result
before
he
went
again
to
his
labours
he
addressed
the
group
air
getting
pretty
bad
i
guess
is
it
dark
one
of
them
asked
tremulously
no
fifteen
minutes
more
the
expert
glanced
at
the
bank
president
hesitated
struggled
frenziedly
for
a
while
and
then
sighed
afraid
i
ca
get
him
out
sir
the
combination
is
jammed
and
the
is
all
off
the
president
considered
do
you
know
of
anyone
else
who
could
do
this
the
man
shook
his
head
no
i
supposed
to
be
the
best
i
been
called
out
for
this
maybe
six
times
i
never
missed
before
you
see
we
make
this
safe
or
we
used
to
make
it
and
i
a
specialist
it
looks
serious
the
president
took
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
well
go
ahead
anyway
until
it
too
late
hugo
stepped
away
from
the
wall
i
think
i
can
get
him
out
they
turned
toward
him
the
president
looked
at
him
coldly
and
who
are
you
robinson
answered
he
the
new
man
shayne
recommended
so
highly
ah
and
how
do
you
propose
to
get
him
out
young
man
hugo
stood
pensively
for
a
moment
by
methods
known
only
to
me
i
am
certain
i
can
do
it
but
i
will
undertake
it
only
if
you
will
all
leave
the
room
ridiculous
robinson
said
the
president
mouth
worked
he
looked
more
sharply
at
hugo
then
he
rose
come
on
everybody
he
spoke
quietly
to
hugo
you
have
a
nerve
how
much
time
do
you
want
five
minutes
only
five
minutes
the
president
murmured
as
he
walked
from
the
chamber
hugo
did
not
move
until
they
had
all
gone
then
he
locked
the
door
behind
them
he
walked
to
the
safe
and
rapped
on
it
tentatively
with
his
knuckles
he
removed
his
coat
and
vest
he
planted
his
feet
against
the
steel
sill
under
the
door
he
caught
hold
of
the
two
handles
fidgeted
with
his
elbows
drew
a
deep
breath
and
pulled
there
was
a
resonant
metallic
sound
something
gave
the
edge
of
the
door
moved
outward
and
a
miasma
steamed
through
the
aperture
hugo
changed
his
stance
and
took
the
door
itself
in
his
hands
his
back
bent
he
pulled
again
with
a
reverberating
clang
and
a
falling
of
broken
steel
it
swung
out
hugo
dragged
the
man
who
lay
on
the
floor
to
a
window
that
gave
on
a
grated
pit
he
broke
the
glass
with
his
fist
the
clerk
chest
heaved
violently
he
panted
opened
his
eyes
and
closed
them
tremblingly
hugo
put
on
his
coat
and
vest
and
unlocked
the
door
the
people
outside
all
moved
toward
him
it
all
right
hugo
said
he
out
robinson
glanced
at
the
clerk
and
walked
to
the
safe
he
ruined
it
she
said
in
a
shrill
voice
the
president
was
behind
her
he
looked
at
the
handles
of
the
vault
which
had
been
bent
like
and
he
stooped
to
examine
the
shattered
bolts
then
his
eyes
travelled
to
hugo
there
was
a
profoundly
startled
expression
in
them
the
clerk
was
sobbing
presently
he
stopped
who
got
me
out
they
indicated
hugo
and
he
crossed
the
floor
on
tottering
feet
thanks
mister
he
said
piteously
oh
my
god
what
a
wonderful
thing
to
do
i
i
just
passed
out
when
i
saw
your
fingers
reaching
around
never
mind
hugo
interrupted
it
all
right
buddy
the
president
touched
his
shoulder
come
up
to
my
office
a
doctor
arrived
several
people
left
others
stood
around
the
demolished
door
the
president
was
alone
when
hugo
entered
and
sat
down
he
was
cold
and
he
eyed
hugo
coldly
how
did
you
do
that
hugo
shrugged
that
my
secret
mr
mills
pretty
clever
i
say
not
when
you
know
how
hugo
was
puzzled
his
ancient
reticence
about
himself
was
acting
together
with
a
natural
modesty
some
new
explosive
not
exactly
electricity
magnetism
hugo
chuckled
no
all
wrong
could
you
do
it
on
a
modern
safe
i
do
know
president
mills
rubbed
his
fingers
on
the
mahogany
desk
i
presume
you
were
planning
that
for
other
purposes
what
hugo
said
very
well
done
very
well
acted
i
will
play
up
to
you
danner
danner
i
play
up
to
this
assumption
of
innocence
you
have
saved
a
man
life
you
are
of
course
blushingly
modest
but
you
have
shown
your
hand
rather
clearly
hmmm
he
smiled
sardonically
i
read
a
book
about
a
who
opened
a
safe
to
get
a
child
out
at
the
expense
of
his
liberty
and
position
or
at
the
hazard
of
them
anyhow
maybe
you
have
read
the
same
book
maybe
hugo
answered
icily
blasters
light
fingers
educated
to
the
dials
and
ears
attuned
to
the
tumblers
we
can
cope
with
those
things
danner
but
this
new
stunt
of
yours
well
until
we
find
out
what
it
is
we
ca
let
you
go
this
is
business
danner
it
involves
money
millions
the
security
of
american
finance
of
the
very
nation
you
will
understand
society
can
not
afford
to
permit
a
man
like
you
to
go
at
large
until
it
has
a
thoroughly
effective
defence
against
you
society
must
disregard
your
momentary
sacrifice
momentary
nobleness
your
process
unknown
by
us
constitutes
a
great
social
danger
i
do
not
dare
overlook
it
i
can
not
disregard
it
even
after
the
service
you
have
done
even
if
i
thought
you
never
intended
to
put
it
to
malicious
use
hugo
thoughts
were
far
away
to
the
fort
he
had
built
when
he
was
a
child
in
colorado
to
the
wagon
he
had
lifted
up
to
the
long
discouraging
gauntlet
of
hard
hearts
and
frightened
eyes
that
his
miracles
had
met
with
his
voice
was
wistful
when
at
last
he
addressed
the
banker
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
sha
bandy
words
danner
i
propose
to
hang
on
to
you
until
i
get
that
secret
and
i
shall
be
absolutely
without
mercy
that
is
frank
is
it
not
quite
you
comprehend
the
significance
of
the
third
degree
not
clearly
you
will
learn
about
it
unless
you
are
reasonable
hugo
bowed
sadly
the
president
pressed
a
button
two
policemen
came
into
the
room
mcclaren
has
my
instructions
he
said
come
on
hugo
rose
and
stood
between
them
he
realized
that
the
whole
pantomime
of
his
arrest
was
in
earnest
for
one
brief
instant
the
president
was
given
a
glimpse
of
a
smile
a
smile
that
worried
him
for
a
long
time
he
was
so
worried
that
he
called
mcclaren
on
the
telephone
and
added
to
his
already
abundant
instructions
a
handful
of
bystanders
collected
to
watch
hugo
cross
from
the
bank
to
the
steel
patrol
wagon
it
moved
forward
and
its
bell
sounded
the
policemen
had
searched
hugo
and
now
they
sat
dumbly
beside
him
he
was
handcuffed
to
both
of
them
once
he
looked
down
at
the
nickel
bonds
and
up
at
the
dull
faces
his
eyebrows
lifted
a
fraction
of
an
inch
captain
mcclaren
received
hugo
in
a
bare
room
shadowed
by
bars
he
was
a
man
with
a
flabby
mouth
from
which
protruded
a
moist
and
chewed
toothpick
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bland
he
made
hugo
strip
nude
and
gave
him
a
suit
of
soiled
clothes
hugo
remained
alone
in
that
room
for
thirty
hours
without
food
or
water
the
strain
of
that
ordeal
was
greater
than
his
jailers
could
have
conceived
but
he
bore
it
with
absolute
stoicism
early
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
the
lights
in
the
room
were
put
out
a
glaring
automobile
lamp
was
set
up
on
a
table
he
was
seated
in
front
of
it
and
men
behind
the
table
began
to
question
him
in
voices
that
strove
to
be
terrible
they
asked
several
questions
and
ultimately
boiled
them
down
to
one
how
did
you
get
that
safe
open
which
was
bawled
at
him
and
whispered
hoarsely
at
him
from
the
darkness
behind
the
light
until
his
mind
rang
with
the
words
until
he
was
waiting
frantically
for
each
new
issue
of
the
words
until
sweat
glistened
on
his
brow
and
he
grew
weak
and
nauseated
his
head
ached
splittingly
and
his
heart
pounded
they
desisted
at
dawn
gave
him
a
glass
of
water
which
he
gulped
and
a
dose
of
castor
oil
which
he
allowed
them
to
force
into
his
mouth
a
few
hours
later
they
began
again
it
was
night
before
they
gave
up
the
remnant
of
hugo
clenched
sanity
was
dumbfounded
at
what
followed
after
that
they
beat
his
face
with
fists
that
shot
from
the
blackness
they
threw
him
to
the
floor
and
kicked
him
when
his
skin
did
not
burst
and
he
did
not
bleed
they
beat
and
kicked
more
viciously
they
lashed
him
with
rubber
hoses
they
twisted
his
arms
as
far
as
they
could
until
the
bones
of
an
ordinary
man
would
have
become
dislocated
except
for
thirst
and
hunger
and
the
discomfort
caused
by
the
castor
oil
hugo
did
not
suffer
they
refined
their
torture
slowly
they
tried
to
drive
a
splinter
under
his
nails
they
turned
on
the
lights
and
drank
water
copiously
in
his
presence
they
finally
brought
a
blowtorch
and
prepared
to
brand
him
hugo
perceived
that
his
invulnerability
was
to
stand
him
in
stead
no
longer
his
tongue
was
swollen
but
he
could
still
talk
sitting
placidly
in
his
bonds
he
watched
the
soldering
iron
grow
white
in
the
softly
roaring
flame
when
in
the
full
light
that
shone
on
the
bare
and
hideous
room
they
took
up
the
iron
and
approached
him
hugo
spoke
wait
i
tell
you
mcclaren
put
the
iron
back
you
will
eh
no
oh
you
wo
i
sha
tell
you
mcclaren
i
show
you
and
may
god
have
mercy
on
your
filthy
soul
there
were
six
men
in
the
room
hugo
looked
from
one
to
another
he
could
tolerate
nothing
more
he
had
followed
the
course
of
president
mills
social
theory
far
enough
to
be
surfeited
with
it
there
was
decision
in
his
attitude
and
not
one
of
the
six
men
who
had
worked
his
torment
in
relays
could
have
failed
to
feel
the
chill
of
that
decision
they
stood
still
mcclaren
voice
rang
out
cover
him
boys
hugo
stretched
his
bonds
burst
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
splintered
to
kindling
six
revolvers
spat
simultaneously
hugo
felt
the
sting
of
the
bullets
six
chambers
were
emptied
the
room
eddied
smoke
there
was
a
harsh
silence
now
hugo
said
gently
i
will
demonstrate
how
i
opened
that
safe
christ
save
us
one
of
the
men
whispered
crossing
himself
mcclaren
was
frozen
still
hugo
walked
to
the
wall
of
the
jail
and
stabbed
his
fist
through
it
brick
and
mortar
burst
out
on
the
other
side
and
fell
into
the
cinder
yard
hugo
kicked
and
lashed
with
his
fists
a
large
hole
opened
then
he
turned
to
the
men
they
broke
toward
the
door
but
he
caught
them
one
by
one
and
one
by
one
he
knocked
them
unconscious
that
much
was
for
his
own
soul
only
mcclaren
was
left
he
carried
mcclaren
to
the
hole
and
dropped
him
into
the
yard
he
wrenched
open
the
iron
gate
and
walked
out
on
the
street
holding
the
policeman
by
the
arm
mcclaren
fainted
twice
and
hugo
had
to
keep
him
upright
by
clinging
to
his
collar
it
was
dark
he
hailed
a
cab
and
lifted
the
man
in
just
drive
out
of
town
hugo
said
mcclaren
came
to
they
bumped
along
for
miles
and
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
the
apartment
buildings
thinned
street
lights
disappeared
they
traversed
a
stretch
of
woodland
and
then
rumbled
through
a
small
town
who
are
you
mcclaren
said
i
just
a
man
mcclaren
a
man
who
is
going
to
teach
you
a
lesson
the
taxi
was
on
a
smooth
turnpike
it
made
swift
time
twice
hugo
satisfied
the
driver
that
the
direction
was
all
right
at
last
on
a
deserted
stretch
hugo
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
mcclaren
thought
that
he
was
going
to
die
he
did
not
plead
hugo
still
held
him
by
the
arm
and
helped
him
from
the
cab
got
any
money
on
you
hugo
asked
about
twenty
dollars
give
me
five
with
trembling
fingers
mcclaren
produced
the
bill
he
put
the
remainder
of
his
money
back
in
his
pocket
automatically
the
was
watching
but
hugo
ignored
him
mcclaren
he
said
soberly
here
your
lesson
i
just
happen
to
be
the
strongest
man
in
the
world
never
tell
anybody
that
and
do
tell
anyone
where
i
took
you
wherever
it
is
i
sha
be
here
anyway
if
you
tell
either
of
those
two
things
i
eat
you
actually
there
was
a
poor
devil
smothering
in
that
safe
and
i
yanked
it
open
and
dragged
him
out
as
a
reward
you
and
your
dirty
scavengers
were
put
to
work
on
me
if
i
were
as
merciful
as
god
himself
you
all
be
dead
now
that
your
lesson
keep
your
mouth
shut
here
is
the
final
parable
still
holding
the
policeman
arm
he
walked
to
the
taxi
and
to
the
astonishment
of
the
driver
gripped
the
axle
in
one
hand
lifted
up
the
front
end
like
a
derrick
and
turned
the
entire
car
around
he
put
mcclaren
in
the
back
seat
do
forget
mcclaren
to
the
driver
back
to
where
you
picked
us
up
the
bird
in
the
back
seat
will
be
glad
to
pay
the
red
lamp
of
the
cab
vanished
hugo
turned
in
the
other
direction
and
began
to
run
in
great
leaps
he
slowed
when
he
came
to
a
town
a
light
was
burning
in
an
restaurant
hugo
produced
the
bill
give
me
a
bucket
of
water
and
put
on
about
five
steaks
five
xix
it
was
bright
morning
when
hugo
awoke
through
the
in
the
room
where
he
had
slept
he
could
see
a
straggling
back
yard
damp
clothes
moved
in
the
breeze
and
beyond
was
a
depression
green
with
young
shoots
he
descended
to
the
restaurant
and
ate
his
breakfast
automobiles
were
swishing
along
the
road
outside
and
he
could
hear
a
clatter
of
dishes
in
the
kitchen
afterwards
he
went
out
doors
and
walked
through
the
busy
centre
of
the
village
and
on
into
the
country
sun
streamed
upon
him
the
sky
was
blue
birds
twittered
in
the
budding
bushes
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
beauty
and
peacefulness
of
springtime
now
it
came
over
him
with
a
rush
pastel
colours
and
fecund
warmth
smells
of
earth
and
rain
melodious
haphazard
wind
he
knew
intuitively
that
mcclaren
would
never
send
for
him
he
wondered
what
mills
would
say
to
shayne
about
him
both
thoughts
passed
like
white
clouds
over
his
mind
and
he
forgot
them
for
an
indolent
vegetative
tranquillity
the
road
curved
over
hills
and
descended
into
tinted
valleys
farmers
were
ploughing
and
planting
the
men
at
the
restaurant
had
told
him
that
he
was
in
connecticut
that
did
not
matter
for
any
other
place
would
have
been
the
same
on
this
may
morning
a
offered
him
a
ride
which
hugo
refused
and
then
watching
the
cubic
van
surge
away
in
the
distance
he
wished
fugitively
that
he
had
accepted
two
half
dollars
and
a
quarter
jingled
in
his
pocket
his
suit
was
seedy
and
his
beard
unshaven
a
picture
of
new
york
ran
through
his
mind
he
stood
far
off
from
it
gazing
at
the
splendour
of
its
towers
in
the
morning
light
he
came
closer
and
the
noise
of
it
smote
his
ears
suddenly
he
plunged
into
the
city
his
perspective
vanished
and
there
rose
about
him
the
ugly
unrelated
inchoate
masses
of
tawdriness
that
had
been
glorious
from
a
distance
while
people
dour
malicious
selfish
people
who
scuttled
like
ants
supplanted
the
vista
of
stone
and
steel
the
trite
truth
of
the
ratio
between
approach
and
enchantment
amused
him
it
was
so
obvious
yet
so
few
mortals
had
the
fine
sense
to
withdraw
themselves
he
was
very
happy
walking
tirelessly
along
that
road
after
his
luncheon
he
allowed
a
truck
to
carry
him
farther
from
the
city
deeper
into
the
magic
of
spring
the
driver
bubbled
with
it
he
wore
a
purple
tulip
in
his
greasy
cap
and
he
slowed
down
on
the
hilltops
with
an
unassuming
reverence
and
a
naïve
slang
that
fitted
well
with
hugo
mood
when
he
reached
his
destination
hugo
walked
on
with
reluctance
shadows
of
the
higher
places
moved
into
the
lowlands
he
crossed
a
brook
and
leaned
over
its
middle
on
the
bridge
rail
fascinated
by
an
underwater
landscape
complete
full
of
colour
less
than
a
foot
high
from
every
side
came
the
strident
music
of
frogs
spring
spring
spring
they
sang
rolling
their
liquid
gutturals
and
stopping
abruptly
when
he
came
too
near
in
the
evening
far
from
the
city
he
turned
from
the
pavement
on
a
muddy
country
road
walking
on
until
he
reached
the
skeleton
of
an
old
house
there
he
lay
down
taking
his
supper
from
his
pocket
and
eating
it
slowly
the
floor
of
the
second
story
had
fallen
down
and
he
could
see
the
stars
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
in
such
houses
he
thought
the
first
chapters
of
american
history
had
been
lived
when
it
was
entirely
dark
a
whippoorwill
began
to
make
its
sweet
and
mournful
music
warmth
and
chilliness
came
together
from
the
ground
he
slept
in
the
morning
he
followed
the
road
into
the
hills
long
stretches
of
woodland
were
interrupted
by
fields
he
passed
farmhouses
and
the
paved
drive
of
an
estate
more
than
a
mile
from
the
deserted
farm
more
than
two
miles
from
the
main
road
half
hidden
in
a
skirt
of
venerable
trees
he
saw
an
old
green
house
behind
which
was
a
row
of
barns
it
was
a
big
house
tile
medallions
had
been
set
in
its
foundations
by
an
architect
whose
tombstone
must
now
be
aslant
and
illegible
it
was
built
on
a
variety
of
planes
and
angles
gables
cropped
at
random
from
its
mossy
roof
grass
grew
in
the
broad
yard
under
the
trees
and
in
the
grass
were
crocuses
yellow
and
red
and
blue
like
confetti
hugo
paused
to
contemplate
this
peaceful
edifice
a
man
walked
briskly
from
one
of
the
barn
doors
he
perceived
hugo
and
stopped
holding
a
spade
in
his
hand
then
after
starting
across
to
the
house
he
changed
his
mind
and
dropping
the
spade
approached
hugo
looking
for
work
my
man
hugo
smiled
why
yes
know
anything
about
cattle
i
was
reared
in
a
farming
country
good
he
scrutinized
hugo
minutely
i
try
you
at
eight
dollars
a
week
room
and
board
he
opened
the
gate
hugo
paused
the
notion
of
finding
employment
somewhere
in
the
country
had
been
fixed
in
his
mind
and
he
wondered
why
he
waited
even
as
he
did
when
the
charm
of
the
old
manor
had
offered
itself
to
him
as
if
by
a
miracle
the
man
swung
open
the
gate
he
was
lithe
sober
direct
my
name
is
cane
ralph
cane
we
raise
blooded
guernsey
stock
here
at
the
moment
we
have
a
man
i
see
hugo
said
i
could
make
the
eight
ten
in
a
week
if
you
were
satisfactory
i
was
considering
the
money
how
i
was
considering
the
money
oh
come
in
try
it
an
eagerness
was
apparent
in
his
tone
while
hugo
still
halted
on
a
knoll
of
indecision
a
woman
opened
the
french
windows
which
lined
one
façade
of
the
house
and
stepped
down
from
the
porch
she
was
very
tall
and
very
slender
her
eyes
were
slaty
blue
and
there
was
a
delicate
suggestion
almost
an
apparition
of
grey
in
her
hair
what
is
it
ralph
her
voice
was
cool
and
pitched
low
this
is
my
wife
cane
said
my
name
is
danner
cane
explained
i
saw
this
man
standing
by
the
gate
and
now
i
hiring
him
i
see
she
said
she
looked
at
hugo
the
crystalline
substance
of
her
eyes
glinted
transiently
with
some
inwardness
surprise
a
vanishing
gladness
it
might
have
been
you
are
looking
for
work
yes
hugo
answered
cane
spoke
hastily
i
offered
him
eight
a
week
and
board
roseanne
she
glanced
at
her
husband
and
returned
her
attention
inquisitively
to
hugo
are
you
interested
i
try
it
cane
frowned
nervously
walked
to
his
wife
and
nodded
with
averted
face
then
he
addressed
hugo
you
can
sleep
in
the
barn
we
have
quarters
there
i
do
think
we
be
in
for
any
more
cold
weather
if
you
come
with
me
now
i
start
you
right
in
until
noon
hugo
cleaned
stables
there
were
two
dozen
cows
animals
that
would
have
seemed
beautiful
to
a
rustic
connoisseur
and
one
lordly
bull
with
malignant
horns
and
bloodshot
eyes
he
shoveled
the
pungent
and
not
offensive
débris
into
a
wheelbarrow
and
transferred
it
to
a
that
sweated
with
internal
humidity
at
noon
cane
came
into
the
barn
pretty
good
he
said
viewing
floors
fairly
shaved
by
diligence
lunch
is
ready
you
eat
in
the
kitchen
hugo
saw
the
woman
again
she
was
toiling
over
a
stove
her
hair
in
disarray
a
spotted
apron
covering
her
long
body
he
realized
that
they
had
no
servants
that
the
three
of
them
constituted
the
human
inhabitants
of
the
estate
but
there
were
shades
innumerable
shades
of
a
long
past
and
some
of
those
ghosts
had
crept
into
roseanne
slaty
eyes
she
carried
lunch
for
herself
and
her
husband
into
a
front
room
and
left
him
to
eat
in
the
soft
silence
after
lunch
cane
spoke
to
him
again
can
you
plough
it
been
a
long
time
but
i
think
so
good
i
have
a
team
we
drive
to
the
north
field
i
got
to
start
getting
the
corn
in
pretty
soon
the
room
in
the
barn
was
bare
four
board
walls
a
board
ceiling
and
floor
an
iron
cot
blankets
the
sound
and
smell
of
the
cows
beneath
hugo
slept
dreamlessly
and
when
he
woke
he
was
ravenous
his
week
passed
cane
drove
him
like
a
but
to
drive
hugo
was
an
unhazardous
thing
he
did
not
think
much
and
when
he
did
it
was
to
read
the
innuendo
of
living
that
was
written
parallel
to
the
existence
of
his
employer
and
roseanne
they
were
troubled
with
each
other
part
of
that
trouble
sprang
from
an
evident
source
cane
was
a
miser
he
resented
the
amount
of
food
that
hugo
consumed
despite
the
unequal
ratio
of
hugo
labours
when
hugo
asked
for
a
few
dollars
in
advance
he
was
curtly
refused
that
had
happened
at
lunch
one
day
after
lunch
however
and
evidently
after
cane
had
debated
with
his
wife
he
inquired
of
hugo
what
he
wanted
a
razor
and
some
shaving
things
and
new
trousers
hugo
had
said
cane
drove
the
station
wagon
to
town
and
returned
with
the
desired
articles
he
gave
them
to
hugo
thank
you
hugo
said
cane
chuckled
opening
his
thin
lips
wide
all
right
danner
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
money
in
my
bank
money
in
your
bank
sure
i
lived
here
for
years
and
i
get
a
discount
at
the
general
store
but
i
charging
you
full
price
naturally
naturally
hugo
agreed
that
was
one
thing
that
would
make
the
tribulation
in
her
eyes
hugo
wished
that
he
could
have
met
these
two
people
on
a
different
basis
so
that
he
could
have
learned
the
truth
about
them
it
was
plain
that
they
were
educated
cultured
refined
cane
had
said
something
once
about
raising
cattle
in
england
and
roseanne
had
cooked
peas
as
she
had
learned
to
cook
them
in
france
pois
au
she
had
murmured
with
an
unimpeachable
accent
then
the
week
had
passed
and
there
had
been
no
mention
of
the
advance
in
wages
for
himself
hugo
did
not
care
but
it
was
easy
to
see
why
no
one
had
been
working
on
the
place
when
hugo
arrived
why
they
were
eager
to
hire
a
transient
stranger
he
learned
part
of
what
he
had
already
guessed
from
a
clerk
in
the
general
store
one
of
the
cows
was
ailing
cane
could
not
drive
to
town
cane
it
seemed
never
left
the
house
and
its
environs
and
they
had
sent
hugo
you
working
for
the
canes
the
clerk
had
asked
yes
funny
people
hugo
replied
indirectly
have
they
lived
here
long
long
roseanne
cane
was
a
bishop
the
bishops
built
that
house
and
the
house
before
it
back
in
the
seventeen
hundreds
they
had
a
lot
of
money
have
it
still
i
guess
but
cane
too
tight
to
spend
it
there
was
nothing
furtive
in
the
youth
manner
he
was
evidently
touching
on
common
village
gossip
yes
sir
too
tight
wo
give
her
a
maid
but
before
her
folks
died
it
was
europe
every
year
and
a
maid
for
every
one
of
and
deary
do
tell
me
that
the
second
time
you
put
on
that
dress
take
it
right
off
and
never
wear
it
again
the
joke
was
part
of
the
formula
for
telling
about
the
canes
and
the
clerk
snickered
appreciatively
yes
sir
you
come
down
here
some
day
when
i
ai
got
the
friday
orders
to
fill
an
i
tell
you
some
things
about
old
man
cane
that
turn
your
stummick
hugo
accepted
his
bundle
set
it
in
the
seat
beside
himself
and
drove
back
to
the
big
green
house
later
in
the
day
he
said
to
cane
if
you
will
want
me
to
drive
the
station
wagon
very
often
i
ought
to
have
a
license
go
ahead
get
one
i
could
afford
it
at
the
moment
and
since
it
would
be
entirely
for
you
i
thought
i
see
cane
answered
calmly
trying
to
get
a
license
out
of
me
well
you
out
of
luck
you
probably
wo
be
needed
as
a
chauffeur
again
for
the
next
year
if
you
are
you
drive
without
a
license
and
drive
damn
carefully
too
because
any
fines
or
any
accidents
would
come
out
of
your
wages
hugo
received
the
insult
unmoved
he
wondered
what
cane
would
say
if
he
smashed
the
car
and
made
an
escape
he
knew
he
would
not
do
it
the
whole
universe
appeared
so
constructed
that
men
like
cane
inevitably
avoided
their
desserts
june
came
and
july
the
was
not
distant
and
occasionally
at
night
hugo
slipped
away
from
the
woods
and
lay
on
the
sand
sometimes
drinking
in
the
firmament
sometimes
closing
his
eyes
when
it
was
very
hot
he
undressed
behind
a
pile
of
boulders
and
swam
far
out
in
the
water
he
swam
naked
unmolested
stirring
up
tiny
whirlpools
of
phosphorescence
and
afterwards
damp
and
cool
he
would
dress
and
steal
back
to
the
barn
through
the
forest
and
the
fields
one
day
a
man
in
middletown
asked
cane
to
call
on
him
regarding
the
possible
purchase
of
three
cows
cane
cows
were
raised
with
the
maximum
of
human
care
the
minimum
of
extraneous
expense
his
profit
on
them
was
great
and
he
sold
them
ordinarily
one
at
a
time
he
was
so
excited
at
the
prospect
of
a
triple
sale
that
for
a
day
he
was
almost
gay
very
nearly
generous
he
drove
off
blithely
not
in
the
sedan
but
in
the
station
wagon
because
its
gasoline
mileage
was
greater
it
was
a
day
filled
with
wonder
for
hugo
when
cane
drove
from
the
house
roseanne
was
standing
beside
the
drive
she
walked
over
to
the
barn
and
said
to
hugo
in
an
oddly
agitated
voice
danner
could
you
spare
an
hour
or
two
this
morning
to
help
me
get
some
flowers
from
the
woods
certainly
she
glanced
in
the
direction
her
husband
had
taken
and
hurried
to
the
kitchen
returning
presently
with
two
baskets
and
a
trowel
he
followed
her
up
the
road
they
turned
off
on
an
overgrown
path
pushed
through
underbrush
and
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
at
the
side
of
a
pond
the
edges
were
grown
thick
with
bushes
and
water
weeds
dead
trees
lifted
awkward
arms
at
the
upper
end
and
dragon
flies
skimmed
over
the
warm
brown
water
i
used
to
come
here
to
play
when
i
was
a
little
girl
she
said
still
just
the
same
she
wore
a
blue
dress
branches
had
dishevelled
her
hair
she
seemed
more
alive
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
it
charming
hugo
answered
there
used
to
be
a
path
all
the
way
around
with
stones
crossing
the
brook
at
the
inlet
and
over
there
underneath
those
pine
trees
there
are
some
orchids
i
always
wanted
to
bring
them
down
to
the
house
i
think
i
could
make
them
grow
of
course
this
is
a
bad
time
to
transplant
anything
but
i
so
seldom
get
a
chance
i
ca
remember
when
when
he
realized
with
a
shock
that
she
was
going
to
cry
she
turned
her
head
away
and
peered
into
the
green
wall
i
think
it
here
she
said
tremulously
they
followed
a
dimly
discernible
trail
there
were
deer
tracks
in
it
and
signs
of
other
animals
whose
feet
had
kept
it
passable
it
was
hot
and
damp
and
they
were
forced
to
bend
low
beneath
the
tangle
to
make
progress
almost
suddenly
they
emerged
in
a
grove
of
white
pines
they
stood
upright
and
looked
wind
stirred
sibilantly
in
the
high
tops
and
the
ground
underfoot
was
a
soft
carpet
the
lake
reflected
the
blue
of
the
sky
instead
of
the
brown
of
its
soft
bottom
let
rest
a
minute
she
said
and
then
i
always
think
a
pine
grove
is
like
a
cathedral
i
read
somewhere
that
pines
inspired
gothic
architecture
do
you
suppose
it
true
there
was
the
lotos
and
the
corinthian
column
hugo
answered
they
sat
down
this
was
a
new
emotion
a
paradoxical
emotion
for
him
he
had
come
to
an
inharmonious
sanctuary
and
he
could
expect
both
tragedy
and
enchantment
there
was
roseanne
herself
a
hidden
beautiful
thing
in
whom
were
prisoned
many
beauties
she
was
growing
old
in
the
frosty
seclusion
of
her
husband
company
she
was
feeding
on
the
toothless
food
of
dreams
when
her
hunger
was
still
strong
that
much
anyone
might
see
the
reason
alone
remained
invisible
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
an
hour
at
hand
an
imminent
moment
of
vision
you
a
strange
man
she
said
finally
that
was
to
be
the
password
yes
i
watched
you
every
day
from
the
kitchen
window
her
depression
had
gone
now
and
she
was
talking
with
a
vague
excitement
have
you
do
you
mind
if
we
pretend
for
a
minute
i
like
it
then
let
pretend
this
is
a
magic
carpet
and
we
flown
away
from
the
world
and
there
nothing
to
do
but
play
play
she
repeated
musingly
i
be
roseanne
and
you
be
hugo
you
see
i
found
out
your
name
from
the
letters
i
found
out
a
lot
about
you
not
facts
like
born
occupation
father
first
name
just
things
he
dared
a
little
then
what
sort
of
things
roseanne
she
laughed
i
knew
you
could
do
it
that
one
of
them
i
found
out
you
had
a
soul
souls
show
even
in
you
looked
at
the
peonies
one
day
and
you
played
with
the
puppies
the
next
in
one
way
hugo
you
a
failure
as
a
farm
hand
failure
a
flop
you
never
make
a
grammatical
mistake
she
saw
his
surprise
and
laughed
again
and
your
manners
and
then
you
understood
french
see
the
carpet
is
taking
us
higher
and
farther
away
is
it
fun
you
the
hired
man
and
i
the
farmer
wife
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
a
prince
and
princess
that
exactly
right
i
wo
pretend
i
not
curious
morbidly
curious
but
i
wo
ask
questions
either
because
that
is
what
the
carpet
is
for
what
is
it
for
roseanne
to
get
away
from
the
world
silly
and
now
there
a
look
about
you
when
i
was
a
little
girl
my
father
was
a
great
man
and
many
great
men
used
to
come
to
our
house
i
know
what
the
frown
of
power
is
and
the
attitude
of
greatness
you
have
them
much
more
than
any
pompous
old
magnate
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
the
way
you
touch
things
and
handle
them
the
way
you
square
your
shoulders
sometimes
i
think
you
not
real
at
all
and
just
an
imaginary
knight
come
to
storm
my
castle
and
sometimes
i
think
you
a
very
famous
man
whose
afternoon
walk
just
has
been
extended
for
a
few
months
the
first
thought
frightens
me
and
the
second
makes
me
wonder
why
i
have
seen
your
picture
in
the
sunday
rotogravures
hugo
shoulders
shook
poor
princess
roseanne
and
what
do
i
think
about
you
then
she
held
up
her
hand
do
tell
me
hugo
i
should
be
sad
after
all
my
life
may
be
what
it
does
not
appear
to
be
she
took
a
brittle
pine
twig
and
dug
in
the
mould
of
the
needles
until
it
broke
ralph
was
different
once
he
was
a
chemist
then
the
war
came
and
he
was
there
and
a
shell
ah
hugo
said
and
you
loved
him
before
i
had
promised
him
before
but
it
changed
him
so
and
it
hard
the
carpet
he
answered
gently
the
carpet
i
almost
dropped
off
and
then
i
have
been
hurt
would
i
a
favour
for
a
favour
i
not
a
great
man
but
i
hope
to
be
one
i
have
something
that
i
think
is
a
talent
let
it
go
at
that
the
letters
come
from
my
father
and
mother
in
colorado
i
never
seen
colorado
it
big
like
the
nursery
of
the
titans
i
think
she
said
softly
and
hugo
shuddered
the
instinct
had
been
too
true
her
eyes
were
suddenly
stormy
i
feel
old
enough
to
mother
you
hugo
and
yet
since
you
came
i
been
a
little
bit
in
love
with
you
it
does
matter
does
it
i
think
i
know
sit
closer
to
me
then
hugo
the
sun
had
passed
the
zenith
before
they
spoke
connectedly
again
time
for
the
magic
carpet
to
come
to
earth
she
said
gaily
is
it
do
be
masculine
any
longer
and
do
be
rudely
possessive
of
course
it
is
are
you
hungry
i
was
hungry
he
began
moodily
all
off
at
earth
come
on
button
me
am
i
a
sight
i
disregard
the
bait
you
being
funny
come
no
wait
we
forgotten
the
orchids
i
wonder
if
i
really
came
for
orchids
should
you
be
terribly
offended
if
i
said
i
thought
i
did
extravagantly
offended
cane
returned
late
in
the
day
the
cows
had
been
sold
i
even
made
five
hundred
clear
and
above
the
feeding
and
labour
on
the
one
with
the
off
leg
she
breed
good
cattle
the
barns
were
as
clean
as
a
park
and
roseanne
was
singing
as
she
prepared
dinner
nothing
happened
until
a
hot
night
in
august
the
leaves
were
still
and
limp
the
moon
had
set
hugo
lay
awake
and
he
heard
her
coming
quietly
up
the
stairs
ralph
had
a
headache
and
he
took
two
triple
bromides
of
course
i
could
always
have
said
that
i
heard
one
of
the
cows
in
distress
and
came
to
wake
you
but
he
jealous
poor
dear
and
then
but
who
could
resist
a
couple
of
simultaneous
alibis
nobody
he
whispered
she
sat
down
on
his
bed
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
felt
that
she
was
in
a
nightdress
i
wish
i
could
see
you
now
then
take
this
flashlight
just
for
an
instant
wait
he
heard
the
rustle
of
her
clothing
now
she
heard
him
draw
in
his
breath
then
the
light
went
out
with
the
approach
of
autumn
weather
roseanne
caught
a
cold
she
continued
her
myriad
tasks
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
miserable
even
cane
sympathized
with
her
gruffly
when
the
week
of
the
cattle
show
in
new
york
arrived
the
cold
was
worse
and
she
begged
off
the
long
trip
on
the
trucks
with
the
animals
he
departed
alone
with
his
two
most
precious
cows
scarcely
thinking
of
her
muttering
about
judges
and
prizes
again
she
came
out
to
the
barn
you
made
me
a
dreadful
hypocrite
i
know
it
you
were
waiting
for
me
men
are
so
disgustingly
sure
of
everything
but
i
made
myself
cough
and
sniffle
until
i
ca
stop
hugo
smiled
broadly
all
aboard
the
carpet
they
lay
in
a
field
that
was
surrounded
by
trees
the
high
weeds
hid
them
goldenrod
hung
over
them
life
ca
go
on
like
this
he
finished
for
her
well
can
it
it
up
to
you
roseanne
i
never
knew
there
were
women
like
me
you
should
have
said
a
woman
would
you
run
away
with
me
never
are
we
just
hunting
for
an
emotion
perhaps
because
there
was
a
day
one
day
in
the
pines
he
nodded
different
from
these
other
two
that
because
of
the
tragic
formation
of
life
there
is
only
one
first
only
one
commencement
only
one
virginity
then
character
sets
in
then
it
becomes
living
it
may
remain
beautiful
but
it
can
not
remain
original
you
be
hard
to
live
with
why
roseanne
because
you
so
determined
not
to
have
an
illusion
and
you
go
on
say
it
i
so
determined
to
have
one
are
we
quarreling
i
can
fix
that
come
closer
roseanne
her
face
changed
through
delicate
shades
of
feeling
to
tenderness
and
to
intensity
abruptly
hugo
leaped
to
his
feet
the
rhythmic
thunder
rode
down
upon
them
like
the
wind
a
few
yards
away
head
down
tail
straight
the
big
bull
charged
over
the
ground
like
an
avalanche
roseanne
lifted
herself
in
time
to
see
hugo
take
two
quick
steps
draw
back
his
fist
and
hit
the
bull
between
the
horns
it
was
a
diabolical
thing
the
bull
was
thrown
back
upon
itself
its
neck
snapped
loudly
its
feet
crumpled
it
dropped
dead
twenty
feet
to
one
side
was
a
stone
wall
hugo
picked
up
a
hoof
and
dragged
the
carcass
to
the
base
of
the
wall
with
his
hand
he
made
an
indenture
in
the
rocks
and
over
the
face
of
the
hollow
he
splashed
the
bull
blood
then
he
approached
roseanne
the
whole
episode
had
occupied
less
than
a
minute
she
had
hunched
her
shoulders
together
and
her
face
was
pale
she
articulated
with
difficulty
the
bull
her
hands
twitched
broke
in
here
and
you
hit
him
just
in
time
roseanne
you
killed
him
then
why
did
you
drag
him
over
there
because
hugo
answered
slowly
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
make
it
seem
as
if
he
charged
the
wall
and
broke
his
neck
that
way
her
frigidity
was
worse
than
any
hysteria
it
is
natural
to
be
able
to
do
things
like
that
it
is
human
he
swallowed
those
words
in
that
stifled
intonation
were
very
familiar
i
know
it
i
very
strong
roseanne
looked
down
at
the
grass
wipe
your
hand
will
you
he
rubbed
it
in
the
earth
you
must
be
frightened
no
she
laughed
a
little
what
must
i
be
then
i
alive
crawling
with
terror
do
touch
me
she
screamed
and
drew
back
i
can
explain
it
you
can
explain
everything
but
not
that
it
was
an
idiotic
wild
unfair
thing
to
have
happen
at
this
time
he
said
my
life
like
that
he
looked
beyond
her
i
began
wanting
to
do
tremendous
things
the
more
i
tried
the
more
discouraged
i
became
you
see
i
was
strong
there
have
been
other
things
figuratively
like
the
bull
but
the
things
themselves
get
littler
and
more
preposterous
because
my
ambition
and
my
nerve
grows
smaller
he
lowered
his
head
some
day
i
sha
want
to
do
anything
at
all
any
more
continuous
and
unwonted
defeat
might
infuriate
some
men
to
a
great
effort
it
tiring
me
he
raised
his
eyes
sadly
to
hers
roseanne
she
gathered
her
legs
under
herself
and
ran
hugo
made
no
attempt
to
follow
her
he
merely
watched
twice
she
tripped
and
once
she
fell
at
the
stone
wall
she
looked
back
at
him
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
able
to
see
her
expression
she
went
on
across
the
fields
a
skinny
flapping
thing
at
last
a
mere
spot
of
moving
colour
hugo
turned
and
stared
at
the
brown
mound
of
the
bull
after
a
moment
he
walked
over
and
stood
above
it
its
tongue
hung
out
and
its
mouth
grinned
it
lay
there
dead
and
yet
to
hugo
it
still
had
life
the
indestructibility
of
a
ghost
and
the
immortality
of
a
symbol
he
sat
beside
it
until
sundown
at
twilight
he
entered
the
barn
and
tended
the
cows
the
doors
of
the
house
were
closed
he
went
without
supper
cane
returned
jubilantly
later
in
the
evening
he
called
hugo
from
the
back
porch
telegram
for
you
hugo
read
the
wire
his
father
was
sick
and
failing
rapidly
i
want
my
wages
he
said
then
he
went
back
to
the
barn
his
trifling
belongings
were
already
wrapped
in
a
bundle
cane
reluctantly
counted
out
the
money
hugo
felt
nauseated
and
feverish
he
put
the
money
in
his
pocket
the
bundle
under
his
arm
he
opened
the
gate
and
his
feet
found
the
soft
earth
of
the
road
in
the
darkness
xx
hugo
had
three
hours
to
wait
for
a
chicago
train
his
wages
purchased
his
ticket
and
left
him
in
possession
of
twenty
dollars
his
clothing
was
nondescript
he
had
no
baggage
he
did
not
go
outside
the
grand
central
terminal
but
sat
patiently
in
the
waiting
for
the
time
to
pass
a
guard
came
up
to
him
and
asked
to
see
his
ticket
hugo
did
not
remonstrate
and
produced
it
mechanically
he
would
undoubtedly
be
mistaken
for
a
tramp
amid
the
sleek
travellers
and
commuters
when
the
train
started
his
fit
of
perplexed
lethargy
had
not
abated
his
hands
and
feet
were
cold
and
his
heart
beat
slowly
life
had
accustomed
him
to
frustration
and
to
disappointment
yet
it
was
agonizing
to
assimilate
this
new
cudgeling
at
the
hands
of
fate
the
old
green
house
in
the
connecticut
hills
had
been
a
refuge
roseanne
had
been
a
refuge
they
were
both
of
them
peaceful
and
whimsical
and
they
had
seemed
innocent
of
the
capacity
for
great
anguish
every
man
dreams
of
the
countryside
as
an
escape
every
man
dreams
of
a
woman
on
whose
broad
breast
he
may
rest
beneath
whose
tumbling
hair
and
hands
he
may
discover
forgetfulness
and
freedom
some
men
are
successful
in
a
quest
for
those
anodynes
hugo
could
understand
the
sharp
contours
of
one
fact
because
he
was
himself
such
a
quest
would
always
end
in
failure
no
woman
lived
who
could
assuage
him
his
fires
would
not
yield
to
any
temporal
powers
he
was
barren
of
desire
to
investigate
deeper
into
the
philosophy
of
himself
all
people
turned
aside
by
fate
fall
into
the
same
morass
except
in
his
strength
hugo
was
pitifully
like
all
people
wounds
could
easily
be
opened
in
his
sensitiveness
his
moral
courage
could
be
taxed
to
the
fringe
of
dilemma
he
looked
upon
his
fellow
men
sometimes
with
awe
at
the
variety
of
high
places
they
attained
in
spite
of
the
heavy
handicap
of
being
human
he
looked
upon
them
again
with
repugnance
and
very
rarely
as
he
grew
older
did
such
inspections
of
his
kind
include
a
study
of
the
difference
between
them
and
him
made
by
his
singular
gift
when
that
thought
entered
his
mind
it
gave
rise
to
peculiar
speculations
he
approached
thirty
he
thought
and
still
the
world
had
not
with
his
name
the
trumps
banners
and
cavalcade
of
his
glory
had
been
only
shadows
in
the
sky
dust
at
sunset
that
made
evanescent
and
intangible
colours
again
he
thought
the
very
perfection
of
his
prowess
was
responsible
for
its
inapplicability
if
he
but
had
an
achilles
heel
so
that
his
might
could
taste
the
occasional
tonic
of
inadequacy
then
he
could
meet
the
challenge
of
possible
failure
with
successful
effort
more
frequently
he
condemned
his
mind
and
spirit
for
not
being
great
enough
to
conceive
a
mission
for
his
thews
then
he
would
fall
into
a
reverie
trying
to
invent
a
creation
that
would
be
as
magnificent
as
the
destructions
he
could
so
easily
envision
in
such
a
painful
and
painstaking
mood
he
was
carried
over
the
alleghenies
and
out
on
the
western
plains
he
changed
trains
at
chicago
without
having
slept
and
all
he
could
remember
of
the
journey
was
a
protracted
sorrow
a
stabbing
consciousness
of
roseanne
dulled
by
his
last
picture
of
her
and
a
hopeless
guessing
of
what
she
thought
about
him
now
hugo
mother
met
him
at
the
station
she
was
unaltered
everything
was
unaltered
the
last
few
instants
in
the
vestibule
of
the
train
had
been
a
series
of
quick
remembrances
the
whole
countryside
was
like
a
house
to
which
he
had
returned
the
mountains
took
on
a
familiar
aspect
then
the
houses
then
the
dingy
red
station
lastly
his
mother
upright
and
uncompromisingly
grim
dressed
in
her
perpetual
mourning
of
black
silk
her
recognition
of
hugo
produced
only
the
slightest
flurry
and
immediately
she
became
mundane
whatever
made
you
come
in
those
clothes
i
was
working
outdoors
mother
i
got
right
on
a
train
how
is
father
sinking
slowly
i
glad
i
in
time
it
god
will
she
gazed
at
him
you
changed
a
little
son
i
older
he
felt
diffident
a
vast
gulf
had
risen
between
this
vigorous
religious
woman
and
himself
she
opened
a
new
topic
whatever
in
the
world
made
you
send
us
all
that
money
hugo
smiled
why
i
did
need
it
mother
and
i
thought
it
would
make
you
and
father
happy
perhaps
perhaps
it
has
done
some
good
i
sent
four
missionaries
out
in
the
field
and
i
am
thinking
of
sending
two
more
i
had
a
new
addition
put
on
the
church
for
the
drunkards
and
the
fallen
and
we
put
a
bathroom
in
the
house
your
father
wanted
two
but
i
would
hear
of
it
have
you
got
a
car
car
i
could
use
one
of
those
inventions
of
satan
your
father
made
me
hire
this
one
to
meet
you
there
anna
blake
house
she
married
that
fellow
she
was
flirting
with
when
you
went
away
and
there
our
house
it
was
painted
last
month
now
all
the
years
had
dropped
away
and
hugo
was
a
child
again
an
adolescent
again
the
car
stopped
you
can
go
right
up
he
in
the
front
room
i
get
lunch
hugo
father
was
lying
on
the
bed
watching
the
door
a
little
wizened
old
man
with
a
big
head
and
thin
yellow
hands
illness
had
made
his
eyes
rheumy
but
they
lighted
up
when
his
son
entered
and
he
half
raised
himself
hello
father
hugo
you
come
back
yes
father
i
waited
for
you
sit
down
here
on
the
bed
move
me
over
a
little
now
close
the
door
is
it
cold
out
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
get
here
i
was
afraid
you
might
get
sick
on
the
train
old
people
are
like
that
hugo
he
shaded
his
eyes
you
are
a
very
big
man
son
somehow
i
always
remembered
you
as
big
but
i
suppose
his
voice
thinned
i
suppose
you
do
want
to
talk
about
yourself
anything
you
want
to
hear
father
i
ca
believe
you
came
back
he
ruminated
there
were
a
thousand
things
i
wanted
to
ask
you
son
but
they
all
gone
from
my
mind
not
so
easy
in
your
presence
as
i
was
when
you
were
a
little
shaver
hugo
knew
what
those
questions
would
be
here
on
his
his
father
was
still
a
scientist
his
soul
flinched
from
giving
its
account
he
saw
suddenly
that
he
could
never
tell
his
father
the
truth
pity
kindredship
kindness
moved
him
i
know
what
you
wanted
to
ask
father
am
i
still
strong
it
took
courage
to
suggest
that
but
he
was
rewarded
the
old
man
sighed
ecstatically
that
it
hugo
my
son
then
father
i
am
i
grew
constantly
stronger
when
i
left
you
in
college
i
was
strong
at
sea
i
was
strong
in
the
war
first
i
wanted
to
be
mighty
in
games
and
i
was
then
i
wanted
to
do
services
and
i
did
because
i
could
the
head
nodded
on
its
feeble
neck
you
found
things
to
do
i
i
hoped
you
would
but
i
always
worried
about
you
every
day
son
every
day
for
all
these
years
i
picked
up
the
papers
and
looked
at
them
with
misgivings
i
said
to
myself
my
boy
lost
his
temper
last
night
suppose
someone
wronged
him
and
he
undertook
to
avenge
himself
i
trusted
you
hugo
i
could
not
quite
trust
the
other
thing
i
even
blamed
myself
and
hated
myself
he
smiled
but
it
all
right
all
right
so
i
am
glad
then
tell
me
what
what
what
have
i
done
do
you
mind
it
been
so
long
and
you
were
so
far
away
well
hugo
swept
his
memory
back
over
his
career
so
many
things
father
it
hard
to
recite
one
own
i
know
but
i
your
father
and
my
ears
ache
to
hear
i
saved
a
man
pinned
under
a
wagon
i
saved
a
man
from
a
shark
i
pulled
open
a
safe
in
which
a
man
was
smothering
many
things
like
that
then
there
was
the
war
i
know
i
know
when
you
wrote
that
you
had
gone
to
war
i
was
frightened
and
happy
try
as
i
might
i
could
not
think
of
a
great
constructive
cause
for
you
to
enter
i
had
to
satisfy
myself
by
thinking
that
you
could
find
such
a
cause
then
the
war
came
and
you
wrote
that
you
were
in
it
i
was
happy
i
am
old
hugo
and
perhaps
my
nationalism
and
my
patriotism
are
dead
sides
in
a
war
did
not
seem
to
matter
but
peace
mattered
to
me
and
i
thought
i
hoped
that
you
could
hasten
peace
four
years
hugo
your
letters
said
nothing
four
years
and
then
it
stopped
and
i
understood
war
is
property
fighting
property
not
david
fighting
goliath
the
greatest
david
would
be
unavailing
now
even
you
could
do
little
enough
perhaps
not
so
little
father
there
were
things
then
hugo
could
not
disappoint
his
father
with
the
whole
formidable
truth
yes
he
lied
with
a
steady
gaze
i
stopped
the
war
you
after
four
years
i
perceived
the
truth
of
what
you
have
just
said
war
is
a
mistake
it
is
not
sides
that
matter
the
object
of
war
is
to
make
peace
on
a
dark
night
father
i
went
alone
into
the
enemy
lines
for
one
hundred
miles
that
night
i
upset
every
gun
i
wrecked
every
ammunition
train
i
blew
up
every
dump
every
arsenal
that
is
alone
i
did
it
the
next
day
they
asked
for
peace
remember
the
false
armistice
somehow
it
leaked
out
that
there
would
be
victory
and
surrender
the
next
night
because
of
me
only
the
truth
about
me
was
never
known
and
a
day
later
it
came
the
weak
old
man
was
transported
he
raised
himself
up
on
his
elbows
you
did
that
then
all
my
work
was
not
in
vain
my
dream
and
my
prayer
were
justified
oh
hugo
you
can
never
know
how
glad
i
am
you
came
and
told
me
this
how
glad
he
repeated
his
expression
of
joy
until
his
tongue
was
weary
then
he
fell
back
hugo
sat
with
shining
eyes
during
the
silence
that
followed
his
father
at
length
groped
for
a
glass
of
water
strength
returned
to
him
i
could
ask
for
no
more
son
and
yet
we
are
petulant
insatiable
creatures
what
is
doing
now
the
world
is
wicked
yet
it
tries
to
rebuild
itself
one
great
deed
is
not
enough
or
are
you
tired
hugo
smiled
am
i
ever
tired
father
am
i
vulnerable
i
had
forgotten
it
is
so
hard
for
the
finite
mind
to
think
beyond
itself
not
tired
not
vulnerable
no
there
was
samson
the
cat
he
was
embarrassed
i
hurt
you
no
father
he
repeated
it
every
gentle
fall
of
the
word
father
from
his
lips
and
every
mention
of
son
by
his
father
was
rare
privilege
unfamiliar
elixir
to
the
old
man
his
new
lie
took
its
cue
from
abednego
danner
expressions
my
work
goes
on
now
it
is
with
america
i
expect
to
go
to
washington
soon
to
right
the
wrongs
of
politics
and
government
vicious
and
selfish
men
i
shall
force
from
their
high
places
i
shall
secure
the
idealistic
and
the
courageous
it
was
a
theory
he
had
never
considered
a
possible
practice
born
of
necessity
the
pressure
i
shall
bring
against
them
will
be
physical
and
mental
here
a
man
will
be
driven
from
his
house
mysteriously
there
a
man
will
slip
into
the
limbo
yonder
an
inconspicuous
person
will
suddenly
be
braced
by
a
new
courage
his
enemies
will
be
gone
and
his
work
will
progress
unhampered
i
shall
be
an
invisible
agent
of
right
right
as
best
i
can
see
it
you
understand
father
abednego
smiled
like
a
happy
child
i
do
son
to
be
you
must
be
splendid
the
most
splendid
thing
on
earth
and
i
have
you
to
thank
you
and
your
genius
to
tender
gratitude
to
i
am
merely
the
agent
it
is
you
that
created
and
the
whole
world
that
benefits
abednego
face
was
serene
not
smug
but
transfigured
i
yearned
as
you
now
perform
it
is
strange
that
one
cloistered
mortal
can
become
inspired
with
the
toil
and
lament
of
the
universe
yet
there
is
a
danger
of
false
pride
in
that
too
i
am
apt
to
fall
into
the
pit
because
my
cup
is
so
full
here
at
the
last
and
the
greatest
problem
of
all
is
not
settled
what
problem
hugo
asked
in
surprise
why
the
problem
that
up
until
now
has
been
with
me
day
and
night
shall
there
be
made
more
men
like
you
and
women
like
you
the
idea
staggered
hugo
it
paralyzed
him
and
he
heard
his
voice
come
from
a
great
distance
up
in
the
attic
in
the
black
trunk
are
six
notebooks
wrapped
in
oilpaper
they
were
written
in
pencil
but
i
went
over
them
carefully
in
ink
that
is
my
hugo
it
is
the
secret
of
you
given
those
books
a
good
laboratory
worker
could
go
through
all
my
experiments
and
repeat
each
with
the
same
success
i
tried
a
little
myself
i
found
out
things
for
example
the
effect
of
the
process
is
not
inherited
by
the
future
generations
it
must
be
done
over
each
time
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
those
six
little
books
you
could
slip
them
all
into
your
coat
pocket
are
a
terrible
explosive
they
can
rip
the
world
apart
and
wipe
humanity
from
it
in
malicious
hands
they
would
end
life
sometimes
when
i
became
nervous
waiting
for
the
newspapers
waiting
for
a
letter
from
you
i
have
been
sorely
tempted
to
destroy
them
but
now
now
hugo
echoed
huskily
now
i
understand
there
is
no
better
keeping
for
them
than
your
own
i
give
them
to
you
me
you
son
you
must
take
them
and
the
burden
must
be
yours
you
have
grown
to
manhood
now
and
i
am
proud
of
you
more
than
proud
if
i
were
not
i
myself
would
destroy
the
books
here
on
this
bed
matilda
would
bring
them
and
i
would
watch
them
burn
so
that
the
danger
would
go
with
he
cleared
his
throat
my
dream
but
you
can
not
deny
me
it
is
my
wish
you
can
see
what
it
means
a
world
grown
suddenly
as
you
are
i
father
you
have
not
avoided
responsibility
you
will
not
avoid
this
the
greatest
of
your
responsibilities
since
the
days
when
i
made
those
notes
what
days
biology
has
made
great
strides
for
a
time
i
was
anxious
for
a
time
i
thought
that
my
research
might
be
rediscovered
but
it
can
not
be
theory
has
swung
in
a
different
direction
he
smiled
with
inner
amusement
the
opticians
have
decided
that
the
microscope
i
made
is
impossible
the
biochemists
moving
through
the
secretions
of
such
things
as
hippuric
acid
in
the
epithelial
cells
to
enzymes
to
hormones
to
chromosomes
have
put
a
false
construction
on
everything
it
will
take
hundreds
thousands
of
years
to
see
the
light
the
darkness
is
so
intense
and
the
error
so
plausible
that
they
may
never
see
again
exactly
as
i
saw
the
fact
of
you
at
best
may
remain
always
no
more
than
a
theory
this
is
not
vanity
my
findings
were
a
combination
of
accidents
almost
outside
the
bounds
of
mathematical
probability
it
is
you
who
must
bear
the
light
hugo
felt
that
now
indeed
circumstance
had
closed
around
him
and
left
him
without
succour
or
recourse
he
bowed
his
head
i
will
do
it
father
now
i
can
die
in
peace
in
joy
with
an
almost
visible
wrench
hugo
brought
himself
back
to
his
surroundings
nonsense
father
you
probably
get
well
no
son
i
studied
the
progress
of
this
disease
in
the
lower
orders
when
i
saw
it
imminent
i
shall
die
not
in
pain
but
in
sleep
but
i
shall
not
be
dead
because
of
you
he
held
out
his
hand
for
hugo
some
time
later
the
old
professor
fell
asleep
and
hugo
tiptoed
from
the
room
food
was
sizzling
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
but
he
ignored
it
going
out
into
the
sharp
air
by
the
front
door
he
hastened
along
the
streets
and
soon
came
to
the
road
that
led
up
the
mountain
he
climbed
rapidly
and
when
he
dared
he
discarded
the
tedious
little
steps
of
all
mankind
he
reached
the
side
of
the
quarry
where
he
had
built
the
stone
fort
and
seated
himself
on
a
ledge
that
hung
over
it
trees
creepers
and
underbrush
had
grown
over
the
place
but
through
the
barricade
of
their
branches
he
could
see
a
heap
of
stones
that
was
his
dolmen
on
which
the
hieroglyph
of
him
was
inscribed
two
tears
scalded
his
cheeks
he
trembled
with
the
welter
of
his
emotions
he
had
failed
his
father
failed
his
trust
failed
the
world
and
in
the
abyss
of
that
grief
he
could
catch
no
sight
of
promise
or
hope
having
done
his
best
he
had
still
done
nothing
and
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
lie
to
put
the
thoughts
of
a
dying
man
to
rest
the
pity
of
that
lie
the
folly
of
the
picture
he
had
painted
of
himself
hugo
danner
the
scourge
of
god
hugo
danner
the
destroying
angel
hugo
danner
the
hero
of
a
quick
that
turned
brown
and
dead
like
a
plucked
flower
the
sentimental
soldier
the
involuntary
misanthrope
i
must
do
it
he
whispered
fiercely
the
ruined
stones
echoed
the
sound
of
his
voice
with
a
remote
demoniac
jeer
do
what
what
strong
man
what
xxi
now
the
winds
keened
from
the
mountains
and
snow
fell
abednego
danner
the
magnificent
abednego
danner
was
carried
to
his
last
the
laboratory
of
nature
herself
his
wife
and
his
son
followed
the
bier
the
dirge
was
intoned
the
meaningless
cadence
of
ritual
was
spoken
to
the
cold
ground
a
ghostly
obelisk
was
lifted
up
over
his
meagre
remains
hugo
had
a
wish
to
go
to
the
hills
and
roll
down
some
gigantic
chunk
of
living
rock
to
mark
that
place
until
the
coming
of
a
glacier
but
he
forbore
and
followed
all
the
dark
conventions
of
disintegration
the
will
was
read
and
the
bulk
of
hugo
sorry
gains
was
thrust
back
into
his
keeping
he
went
into
the
attic
and
opened
the
black
trunk
where
the
six
small
notebooks
lay
in
oilpaper
he
took
them
out
and
unwrapped
them
the
first
two
books
were
a
maze
of
numbered
experiments
in
the
third
a
more
vigorous
calligraphy
a
quivering
tracery
of
excitement
marked
the
repressed
beginning
of
a
new
earth
he
bought
a
bag
and
some
clothes
and
packed
the
false
contralto
of
his
mother
hymns
as
she
went
about
the
house
filled
him
with
such
despair
that
he
left
after
the
minimum
interval
allowed
by
filial
decency
she
was
a
grim
old
woman
still
one
to
whom
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
to
africa
was
a
passion
the
polishing
of
the
coal
stove
a
duty
and
the
presence
of
her
unfamiliar
son
a
burden
when
he
said
he
kissed
her
which
left
her
standing
on
the
station
platform
looking
at
the
train
with
a
flat
uncomprehending
expression
hugo
knew
where
he
was
going
and
why
he
was
on
his
way
to
washington
the
great
crusade
was
to
begin
he
had
no
plans
only
ideals
which
are
plans
of
a
sort
he
had
told
his
father
he
was
making
the
world
a
better
place
and
the
idea
had
taken
hold
of
him
he
would
grapple
the
world
his
world
at
its
source
he
would
no
longer
attempt
to
rise
from
a
lowly
place
he
would
exert
his
power
in
the
highest
places
government
politics
law
were
malleable
to
the
force
of
one
man
most
of
his
illusion
was
gone
as
he
had
said
so
glibly
to
his
father
there
were
good
men
and
corrupt
in
the
important
situations
in
the
world
to
the
good
he
would
lend
his
strength
to
the
corrupt
he
would
exhibit
his
embattled
antipathy
he
would
be
not
one
impotent
person
seeking
to
dominate
but
the
agent
of
uplift
he
would
be
what
he
perceived
life
had
meant
him
to
be
an
instrument
he
could
not
be
a
leader
but
he
could
create
a
leader
such
was
his
intention
he
had
seen
a
new
way
to
reform
the
world
and
if
his
inspiration
was
clouded
occasionally
with
doubt
he
disavowed
the
doubts
as
a
christian
disavows
temptation
this
was
to
be
his
magnificent
gesture
he
closed
his
eyes
to
the
inferences
made
by
his
past
he
never
thought
of
himself
as
pathetic
or
quixotic
his
ability
to
measure
up
to
external
requirements
was
infinite
his
disappointment
lay
always
he
thought
in
his
spirit
and
his
intelligence
he
went
to
washington
the
world
was
pivoting
there
his
first
few
weeks
were
dull
he
installed
himself
in
a
pleasant
house
and
hired
two
servants
the
use
to
which
he
was
putting
his
funds
compensated
for
their
origin
it
was
men
like
shayne
who
would
suffer
from
his
mission
and
such
a
man
came
into
view
before
very
long
hugo
interested
himself
in
politics
and
the
appearance
of
politics
he
read
the
he
talked
with
everyone
he
met
he
went
daily
to
the
capitol
and
listened
to
the
amazing
pattern
of
harangue
from
the
lips
of
innumerable
statesmen
in
looking
for
a
cause
his
eye
fell
naturally
on
the
problem
of
disarmament
hugo
saw
at
once
that
it
was
a
great
cause
and
that
it
was
bogged
in
the
greed
of
individuals
it
is
not
difficult
to
become
politically
partisan
in
the
capitol
of
any
nation
it
was
patent
to
hugo
that
disarmament
meant
a
removal
of
the
chance
for
war
hugo
hated
war
he
moved
hither
and
thither
making
friends
learning
entertaining
never
exposing
his
plan
which
his
new
friends
thought
to
be
lobbying
for
some
impending
legislation
he
picked
out
an
individual
readily
enough
some
of
the
men
he
had
come
to
know
were
in
the
senate
others
in
the
house
of
representatives
others
were
diplomats
newspaper
reporters
attachés
each
alliance
had
been
cemented
with
care
and
purpose
his
knowledge
of
an
enemy
came
by
whisperings
by
hints
by
plain
statements
congressman
hatten
who
argued
so
eloquently
for
laying
down
arms
and
picking
up
the
cause
of
humanity
was
a
guest
of
hugo
danner
he
said
after
a
third
highball
you
a
sensible
chap
but
you
do
quite
get
us
i
fighting
for
disarmament
and
making
a
grand
fight
the
congressman
waved
his
hand
sure
that
what
i
mean
you
really
want
this
thing
for
itself
but
between
you
and
me
i
do
give
a
rap
about
ships
and
guns
my
district
is
a
farm
district
we
interested
in
paying
millions
in
taxes
to
the
bosses
and
owners
in
a
coal
and
iron
community
so
i
against
it
dead
against
it
with
my
constituency
behind
me
nobody
really
wants
to
spend
the
money
except
the
shipbuilders
and
steel
men
maybe
they
do
theoretically
but
the
money
in
it
is
too
big
that
why
i
fight
and
your
speeches
pap
danner
pure
pap
even
the
yokels
in
my
home
towns
realize
that
it
does
seem
like
pap
to
me
that
politics
in
a
way
it
is
two
boys
i
was
fond
of
are
lying
over
there
in
france
i
do
want
to
make
any
more
shells
but
i
have
to
think
of
something
else
first
if
i
came
from
some
other
district
the
case
would
be
reversed
i
like
to
change
the
tariff
but
the
industrials
oppose
me
in
that
so
we
compromise
or
we
do
i
think
i
could
put
across
a
decent
bill
right
now
for
example
if
i
could
get
willard
melcher
out
of
town
for
a
month
melcher
you
know
him
of
course
at
least
who
he
is
he
spends
the
steel
money
here
in
washington
to
keep
the
building
program
going
on
simple
thing
to
do
the
navy
helps
him
tell
the
public
about
the
japanese
menace
the
english
menace
all
the
other
menaces
and
the
public
coughs
up
for
bigger
guns
and
better
ships
run
till
they
rust
and
nobody
ever
really
knows
what
good
they
could
do
and
melcher
does
that
the
congressman
chuckled
his
would
make
your
eyes
bulge
but
you
ca
touch
him
hugo
nodded
thoughtfully
do
you
think
anyone
around
here
works
purely
for
an
idea
how
that
oh
i
understand
sure
the
cranks
and
his
laughter
ended
the
discussion
hugo
began
he
walked
up
the
brick
steps
of
melcher
residence
and
pulled
the
glittering
brass
knob
a
servant
came
to
the
door
danner
to
see
melcher
just
a
moment
a
wait
in
the
hall
the
servant
returned
sorry
but
he
not
in
hugo
mouth
was
firm
please
tell
him
that
i
saw
him
come
in
i
sorry
sir
but
he
is
going
right
out
tell
him
that
he
will
see
me
the
servant
raised
his
voice
harry
a
heavy
person
with
a
flattened
nose
and
cauliflower
ears
stepped
into
the
hall
this
gentleman
wishes
to
see
melcher
and
melcher
is
not
in
to
him
take
care
of
him
harry
the
servant
withdrew
run
along
fellow
hugo
smiled
melcher
keeps
a
bouncer
an
evil
light
flickered
in
the
other
eyes
yeah
fellow
and
i
came
up
from
the
pennsy
mines
i
a
tough
guy
so
beat
it
not
so
tough
your
ears
and
nose
are
a
sight
hugo
said
lightly
the
man
advanced
his
voice
was
throaty
git
you
go
to
the
devil
i
came
here
to
see
melcher
and
i
going
to
see
him
yeah
the
tough
one
drew
back
his
fist
but
he
never
understood
afterwards
what
had
taken
place
he
came
to
in
the
kitchen
an
hour
later
melcher
heard
him
rumble
to
the
floor
and
emerged
from
the
library
he
was
a
huge
man
bigger
than
his
bouncer
his
face
was
hard
and
sinister
and
it
lighted
with
an
unpleasant
smile
when
he
saw
the
unconscious
thug
and
measured
the
size
of
hugo
pulled
a
fast
one
on
harry
eh
i
came
to
see
you
melcher
well
might
as
well
come
in
now
i
worked
up
from
the
mines
myself
and
i
a
hard
egg
if
you
got
funny
with
me
you
get
killed
wha
daya
want
hugo
sat
down
in
a
leather
chair
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
was
comparatively
without
emotion
this
was
his
appointed
task
and
he
would
make
short
shrift
of
it
i
came
here
melcher
he
began
to
talk
about
your
part
in
the
arms
conferences
it
happens
that
i
disagree
with
you
and
your
propaganda
it
happens
that
i
have
a
method
of
enforcing
my
opinion
disarmament
is
a
great
thing
for
the
world
and
putting
the
idea
across
is
the
first
step
toward
even
bigger
things
i
know
the
relative
truths
of
what
you
say
about
america
peril
and
what
you
get
from
saying
it
am
i
clear
melcher
had
reddened
he
nodded
perfectly
i
have
nothing
to
add
get
out
of
town
melcher
eyes
narrowed
do
you
really
believe
that
sending
me
out
of
town
would
do
any
good
do
you
have
the
conceit
to
think
that
one
nutty
shrimp
like
you
can
buck
the
will
and
ideas
of
millions
of
people
hugo
did
not
permit
his
convictions
to
be
shaken
there
happen
to
be
extenuating
circumstances
melcher
really
you
surprise
me
the
broad
sarcasm
was
shaken
like
a
weapon
and
do
you
honestly
think
you
could
chase
me
me
out
of
here
i
am
sure
of
it
how
hugo
extinguished
his
cigarette
i
happen
to
be
more
than
a
man
i
am
he
hesitated
seeking
words
let
us
say
a
devil
or
an
angel
or
a
scourge
i
detest
you
and
what
you
stand
for
if
you
do
not
leave
i
can
ruin
your
house
and
destroy
you
and
i
will
he
finished
his
words
almost
gently
melcher
appeared
to
hesitate
all
right
i
go
immediately
this
afternoon
hugo
was
astonished
you
will
go
i
promise
good
afternoon
mr
danner
hugo
rose
and
walked
toward
the
door
he
was
seething
with
surprise
and
suspicion
had
he
actually
intimidated
melcher
so
easily
his
hand
touched
the
knob
at
that
instant
melcher
hit
him
on
the
head
with
a
chair
it
broke
in
pieces
hugo
turned
around
slowly
i
understand
you
mistook
me
for
a
dangerous
lunatic
i
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
now
melcher
jaw
sagged
in
amazement
when
hugo
did
not
fall
an
instant
later
he
threw
himself
forward
arms
out
head
drawn
between
his
shoulders
with
one
hand
hugo
imprisoned
his
wrists
he
lifted
melcher
from
the
floor
and
shook
him
i
meant
it
melcher
and
i
will
give
you
a
sign
rotten
politics
graft
bad
government
are
doomed
melcher
watched
with
staring
eyes
while
hugo
with
his
free
hand
rapidly
demolished
the
room
he
picked
up
the
great
desk
and
smashed
it
he
tore
the
stone
mantelpiece
from
its
roots
he
kicked
the
fireplace
apart
he
burst
a
hole
in
the
brick
wall
dragging
the
bulk
of
a
man
behind
him
as
he
moved
remember
that
melcher
no
one
else
on
earth
is
like
me
and
i
will
get
you
if
you
fail
to
stop
i
come
for
you
if
you
squeal
about
this
and
i
leave
it
to
you
to
imagine
what
will
happen
hugo
walked
into
the
hall
you
all
done
for
you
cheap
swindlers
and
i
am
doom
the
door
banged
melcher
swayed
on
his
feet
swallowed
hard
and
ran
upstairs
pack
he
said
to
his
valet
he
had
gone
hugo
had
removed
the
first
of
the
public
enemies
yet
hugo
was
not
satisfied
his
approach
to
melcher
had
been
dramatic
terrifying
effective
there
were
rumours
of
that
violent
morning
the
rumours
said
that
melcher
had
been
attacked
that
he
had
been
bought
out
for
bigger
money
that
something
peculiar
was
occurring
in
washington
if
ten
twenty
men
left
and
those
rumours
multiplied
by
geometrical
progression
sheer
intimidation
would
work
a
vast
good
but
other
facts
disconcerted
hugo
in
the
first
place
his
mind
kept
reverting
to
melcher
words
do
you
have
the
conceit
to
think
that
one
person
can
buck
the
will
of
millions
no
matter
how
powerful
that
person
his
logic
added
millions
of
dollars
or
people
the
same
logic
questioned
after
all
did
it
matter
people
could
be
perjured
by
subtler
influences
than
gold
secondly
the
parley
over
arms
continued
to
be
an
impasse
despite
the
absence
of
melcher
perhaps
he
argued
he
had
not
removed
melcher
soon
enough
a
more
carefully
focused
consideration
showed
that
in
spite
of
what
hatten
had
said
it
was
not
individuals
against
whom
the
struggle
was
made
but
mass
stupidity
gigantic
bulwarks
of
human
incertitude
and
a
new
man
came
in
place
a
man
who
employed
different
tactics
hugo
could
not
exorcise
the
world
a
few
days
later
hugo
learned
that
two
radicals
had
been
thrown
into
jail
on
a
charge
of
murder
the
event
had
taken
place
in
newark
new
jersey
a
federal
officer
had
attempted
to
break
up
a
meeting
he
had
been
shot
the
men
arrested
were
blamed
although
it
was
evident
that
they
were
chance
seizures
that
their
proved
guilt
could
be
at
most
only
a
social
resentfulness
at
first
no
one
gave
the
story
much
attention
the
slow
wheels
of
jersey
justice
printed
always
in
quotation
marks
by
the
dailies
began
to
turn
the
men
were
summarily
tried
and
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
a
mob
assaulted
the
jail
where
they
were
confined
without
success
two
of
the
mob
were
wounded
by
riot
guns
a
meeting
was
held
in
berlin
one
in
london
another
in
paris
moscow
was
silent
but
moscow
was
reported
to
be
in
an
uproar
the
trial
assumed
international
proportions
overnight
embassies
were
stormed
legations
from
america
were
forced
to
board
cruisers
strikes
were
ordered
long
queues
of
sullen
men
and
women
formed
at
camp
kitchens
the
president
delivered
a
message
to
congress
on
the
subject
prominent
personages
debated
it
in
public
halls
only
to
be
acclaimed
and
booed
concomitantly
the
sentence
imposed
on
two
russian
immigrants
rocked
the
world
in
some
cities
it
was
not
safe
for
american
tourists
to
go
abroad
in
the
streets
and
all
the
time
the
two
men
drew
nearer
to
the
electric
chair
it
was
then
that
hugo
met
skorvsky
many
people
knew
him
he
was
a
radical
a
writer
he
lived
in
washington
he
styled
himself
an
unofficial
ambassador
of
the
world
a
small
dark
man
with
a
black
moustache
who
attended
one
of
hugo
informal
afternoon
discussions
on
a
vicarious
invitation
come
over
and
see
hugo
danner
he
something
new
in
washington
something
new
in
washington
i
shall
omit
the
obvious
sarcasm
i
shall
go
skorvsky
went
hugo
listened
to
him
talk
about
the
two
prisoners
he
was
lucid
he
made
allowances
for
the
american
democracy
which
in
themselves
were
burning
criticism
hugo
asked
him
to
dinner
they
dined
at
hugo
house
you
have
the
french
taste
in
wines
skorvsky
said
but
as
it
is
to
my
mind
the
finest
taste
in
the
world
i
can
say
only
that
hugo
tried
to
lead
him
back
to
the
topic
that
interested
both
of
them
so
acutely
skorvsky
shrugged
you
are
polite
or
else
you
are
curious
i
know
you
an
american
business
man
in
washington
with
a
purpose
not
an
apparent
purpose
just
now
no
no
just
now
you
are
a
host
cultivated
and
genial
and
retiring
but
at
the
proper
time
ah
a
dam
somewhere
in
arizona
a
forest
that
you
covet
in
alaska
is
it
not
so
what
if
it
is
not
skorvsky
stared
at
the
ceiling
what
then
a
secret
yes
i
thought
that
about
you
while
we
were
talking
to
the
others
there
is
something
deep
about
you
my
new
friend
you
are
a
power
possibly
you
are
not
even
really
an
american
that
is
wrong
you
assure
me
that
i
am
right
but
i
will
agree
with
you
you
are
let
us
say
the
very
epitome
of
the
man
mencken
and
lewis
tell
us
about
so
charmingly
i
am
russian
and
i
can
not
know
all
of
america
you
might
divulge
your
errand
perhaps
suppose
i
said
it
was
to
set
the
world
aright
skorvsky
laughed
lightly
then
i
should
throw
myself
at
your
feet
both
men
were
in
deadly
earnest
hugo
not
quite
willing
to
adopt
the
russian
almost
effeminate
delicacy
yet
eager
to
talk
to
him
or
to
someone
like
him
someone
who
was
more
than
a
great
wheel
in
the
progress
of
the
nation
hugo
yielded
a
little
further
yet
that
is
my
purpose
and
i
am
not
altogether
impotent
there
are
things
i
can
do
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
stretched
himself
with
a
feline
grace
such
as
i
was
thinking
of
your
two
compatriots
who
were
recently
given
such
wretched
justice
suppose
they
were
liberated
by
force
what
then
ah
you
are
an
independent
communist
not
even
that
just
a
friend
of
progress
so
a
dreamer
one
of
the
few
who
have
wealth
and
you
have
a
plan
to
free
these
men
hugo
shrugged
i
merely
speculated
on
the
possible
outcome
of
such
a
thing
assume
that
they
were
snatched
from
prison
and
hidden
beyond
the
law
skorvsky
meditated
it
would
be
a
great
victory
for
the
cause
of
course
a
splendid
lift
to
its
morale
the
cause
of
bolshevism
a
higher
and
a
different
cause
i
can
not
explain
it
briefly
perhaps
i
can
not
explain
it
at
all
but
the
old
world
of
empires
is
crumbled
democracy
is
at
its
farcical
height
the
new
world
is
not
yet
manifest
i
shall
be
direct
what
is
your
plan
mr
danner
i
could
tell
you
anyway
you
would
not
believe
it
but
i
could
guarantee
to
deliver
those
two
men
anywhere
in
the
country
within
a
few
days
without
leaving
a
trace
of
how
it
was
done
what
do
you
think
of
that
skorvsky
i
think
you
are
a
dangerous
and
a
valuable
man
not
many
people
do
hugo
eyes
were
moody
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
a
long
time
nothing
that
i
can
remember
has
happened
during
my
life
that
gives
me
a
greater
feeling
of
understanding
than
the
imprisonment
and
sentencing
of
those
men
i
know
poignantly
the
glances
that
are
given
them
the
stupidity
of
the
police
and
the
courts
the
attitude
of
those
who
condemn
them
without
knowledge
of
the
truth
or
a
desire
for
such
knowledge
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
then
looked
up
quickly
i
know
all
that
passionately
and
intensely
i
know
the
blind
fury
to
which
it
all
gives
birth
i
hate
it
i
detest
it
selfishness
stupidity
malice
i
know
the
fear
it
engenders
a
dreadful
and
a
justified
fear
i
felt
it
very
little
in
this
world
avails
against
it
you
forgive
so
much
sentiment
skorvsky
it
makes
us
brothers
the
russian
spoke
with
force
and
simplicity
you
too
hugo
crossed
the
room
restlessly
i
do
know
i
am
always
losing
my
grip
i
came
to
washington
with
a
purpose
and
i
can
not
screw
myself
to
it
unremittingly
these
men
seem
skorvsky
was
thinking
your
plan
for
them
what
assistance
would
you
need
none
none
why
should
i
need
help
i
never
mind
i
need
none
you
have
your
own
organization
there
is
no
one
but
me
skorvsky
shook
his
head
i
can
not
and
yet
looking
at
you
i
believe
you
can
i
shall
tell
you
you
will
come
with
me
and
meet
my
friends
those
who
are
working
earnestly
for
a
new
america
an
america
ruled
by
intelligence
alone
few
outsiders
enter
our
councils
we
are
all
nearly
all
foreigners
yet
we
are
more
american
than
the
maine
fisherman
the
minnesota
farmer
behind
us
is
a
party
that
grows
apace
this
incident
in
new
jersey
has
added
to
it
as
does
every
dense
mumble
of
congress
every
scandalous
metropolitan
investigation
i
shall
telephone
hugo
allowed
himself
to
be
conducted
but
what
he
found
was
superficially
at
least
what
he
had
dreamed
for
himself
the
house
to
which
he
was
taken
was
pretentious
the
people
in
its
salon
were
amiable
and
educated
there
was
no
sign
of
the
red
flag
the
ragged
reformer
the
anarchist
the
women
were
gracious
the
men
witty
as
he
talked
to
them
one
by
one
he
began
to
believe
that
here
was
the
nucleus
around
which
he
could
construct
his
imaginary
empire
he
became
interested
he
expanded
it
was
late
in
the
night
when
skorvsky
raised
his
voice
slightly
so
that
everyone
would
listen
and
made
an
announcement
friends
i
have
had
the
honour
to
introduce
danner
to
you
now
i
have
the
greater
honour
of
telling
you
his
purpose
and
pledge
night
he
will
go
to
new
jersey
the
silence
became
absolute
and
two
nights
later
he
will
bring
to
us
in
person
from
their
cells
davidoff
and
pletzky
a
quick
pregnant
pause
was
followed
by
excitement
they
took
hugo
by
the
hand
some
of
them
applauded
one
or
two
cheered
they
shouldered
near
him
they
asked
questions
and
expressed
doubts
it
was
broad
daylight
before
they
dispersed
hugo
walked
to
his
house
listening
to
a
long
rhapsody
from
skorvsky
we
will
make
you
a
great
man
if
you
succeed
skorvsky
said
comrade
hugo
went
into
the
hall
and
up
to
his
bedroom
he
sat
on
his
bed
a
dullness
overcame
him
he
had
never
been
patronized
quite
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
that
night
it
exerted
at
once
a
corrosive
and
a
lethargic
influence
he
undressed
slowly
dropping
his
shoes
on
the
floor
splendid
people
they
were
he
thought
a
smaller
voice
suggested
to
him
that
he
did
not
really
care
to
go
to
new
jersey
for
the
prisoners
they
would
be
hard
to
locate
there
would
be
a
sensation
and
a
mystery
again
still
he
had
found
a
purpose
his
telephone
rang
he
reached
automatically
from
the
bed
the
room
was
bright
with
sunshine
which
meant
that
it
was
late
in
the
day
his
brain
took
reluctant
hold
on
consciousness
hello
hello
danner
my
friend
oh
hello
skorvsky
may
i
come
up
it
is
important
sure
i
still
in
bed
but
come
on
hugo
was
under
the
shower
bath
when
his
visitor
arrived
he
invited
skorvsky
to
share
his
breakfast
but
was
impatiently
refused
things
have
happened
since
last
night
comrade
danner
for
one
i
saw
the
chief
chief
you
have
not
met
him
as
yet
we
conferred
about
your
scheme
he
i
regret
to
say
opposed
it
hugo
nodded
i
not
surprised
i
tell
you
what
to
do
you
take
me
to
him
and
i
prove
conclusively
that
it
will
be
successful
then
perhaps
he
will
agree
to
sanction
it
every
time
i
think
of
those
two
poor
devils
snatched
from
a
mob
waiting
there
in
the
dark
for
the
electric
chair
it
makes
my
blood
boil
quite
skorvsky
agreed
but
you
do
not
understand
it
is
not
that
he
doubts
your
ability
if
you
failed
it
would
not
be
important
he
fears
you
might
accomplish
it
i
assured
him
you
would
i
have
faith
in
you
he
afraid
i
would
do
it
that
does
make
sense
skorvsky
it
does
i
regret
to
say
his
expressive
face
stirred
with
discomfort
we
were
too
hasty
too
precipitate
i
see
his
reason
now
we
can
not
afford
as
a
group
to
be
branded
as
that
weak
hugo
said
skorvsky
cleared
his
throat
there
are
other
matters
since
davidoff
and
pletzky
were
jailed
the
party
has
grown
by
leaps
and
bounds
money
has
poured
in
ah
hugo
said
softly
money
skorvsky
raged
go
ahead
be
sarcastic
to
free
those
men
would
cost
us
a
million
dollars
perhaps
too
bad
with
a
million
the
million
their
electrocution
will
bring
from
the
outraged
we
can
accomplish
more
than
saving
two
paltry
lives
we
must
be
hard
we
must
think
ahead
in
thinking
ahead
skorvsky
do
you
not
think
of
the
closing
of
a
switch
and
the
burning
of
human
flesh
for
every
cause
there
must
be
martyrs
their
names
will
live
eternally
and
they
themselves
bah
you
are
impractical
perhaps
hugo
ate
a
slice
of
toast
with
outward
calm
i
was
hoping
for
a
government
that
did
not
weigh
people
against
dollars
nor
do
we
no
skorvsky
leaped
to
his
feet
fool
dreamer
preposterous
idealist
i
must
be
going
hugo
sighed
suppose
i
went
ahead
one
thing
the
russian
turned
with
a
livid
face
one
thing
the
chief
bade
me
tell
you
if
those
men
escape
you
die
oh
hugo
said
he
stared
through
the
window
and
supposing
i
were
to
offer
your
chief
a
million
or
nearly
a
million
for
the
privilege
of
freeing
them
skorvsky
face
returned
to
its
look
of
transfiguration
the
look
that
had
accompanied
his
noblest
words
of
the
night
before
you
would
do
that
comrade
he
whispered
you
would
give
us
give
the
cause
a
million
never
since
the
days
of
our
saviour
has
a
man
like
you
walked
on
this
hugo
stood
up
suddenly
get
out
of
here
his
voice
was
a
cosmic
menace
get
out
of
here
you
dirty
swine
get
out
of
here
before
i
break
you
to
matchwood
before
i
rip
out
your
guts
and
stuff
them
back
through
your
filthy
lying
throat
get
out
oh
god
get
out
xxii
hugo
realized
at
last
that
there
was
no
place
in
his
world
for
him
tides
and
tempest
volcanoes
and
lightning
all
other
majestic
vehemences
of
the
universe
had
a
purpose
but
he
had
none
either
because
he
was
all
those
forces
unnaturally
locked
in
the
body
of
a
man
or
because
he
was
a
giant
compelled
to
stoop
and
pander
to
live
at
all
among
his
feeble
fellows
his
anachronism
was
complete
that
much
he
perceived
calmly
his
tragedy
lay
in
the
lie
he
had
told
to
his
father
great
deeds
were
always
imminent
and
none
of
them
could
be
accomplished
because
they
involved
humanity
humanity
protecting
its
diseases
its
pettiness
its
miserable
convictions
and
conventions
with
the
essence
of
itself
life
life
not
misty
and
fecund
for
the
future
but
life
clawing
at
the
dollar
in
the
hour
the
security
of
platitudes
the
relief
of
visible
facts
the
hope
in
rationalization
the
needs
of
skin
belly
and
womb
beyond
that
he
could
see
destiny
by
interpreting
his
limited
career
through
a
sort
of
ontogenetic
recapitulation
he
had
survived
his
savage
childhood
his
barbaric
youth
and
the
greeces
romes
egypts
and
babylons
of
his
early
manhood
emerging
into
a
present
that
was
endowed
with
as
much
aspiration
and
engaged
with
the
same
futility
as
was
his
contemporary
microcosm
no
life
span
could
observe
anything
but
material
progress
for
so
mean
and
inalterable
is
the
gauge
of
man
that
his
races
topple
before
his
soul
expands
and
the
eventualities
of
his
growth
in
space
and
time
must
remain
a
problem
for
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
years
searching
still
further
he
appreciated
that
no
single
man
could
force
a
change
upon
his
unwilling
fellows
at
most
he
might
inculcate
an
idea
in
a
few
and
live
to
see
its
gradual
spreading
even
then
he
could
have
no
assurance
of
its
contortions
to
the
desire
for
wealth
and
power
or
of
the
consequences
of
those
contortions
finally
to
build
one
must
first
destroy
and
he
questioned
his
right
to
select
unaided
the
objects
for
destruction
he
looked
at
the
capitol
in
washington
and
pondered
the
effect
of
issuing
an
ultimatum
and
thereafter
bringing
down
the
great
dome
like
samson
he
thought
of
the
churches
and
their
bewildering
stupefying
effect
on
masses
who
were
mulcted
by
their
own
fellows
equally
bewildered
equally
stupefied
suppose
through
a
thousand
nights
he
ravaged
the
churches
wrecking
every
structure
in
the
land
laying
waste
property
making
the
loud
unattended
volume
of
worship
an
impossibility
taking
away
the
gods
of
his
forbears
suppose
he
sank
the
navy
annihilated
the
army
set
up
a
despotism
no
matter
how
efficiently
and
well
he
ruled
the
millions
would
hate
him
plot
against
him
attempt
his
life
and
every
essential
agent
would
be
a
hypocritical
sycophant
seeking
selfish
ends
he
reached
the
last
of
his
conclusions
sitting
beside
a
river
whither
he
had
walked
to
think
an
immense
loathing
for
the
world
rose
up
in
him
at
its
apex
a
locomotive
whistled
in
the
distance
thundered
inarticulately
and
rounded
a
bend
it
came
very
near
the
place
where
hugo
reclined
black
smoking
and
noisy
drivers
churning
along
the
rails
a
train
of
passenger
cars
behind
hugo
could
see
the
dots
that
were
people
heads
people
human
beings
how
he
hated
them
the
train
was
very
near
suddenly
all
his
muscles
were
unsprung
he
threw
himself
to
his
feet
and
rushed
toward
the
train
with
a
passionate
desire
to
get
his
fingers
around
the
sliding
piston
to
the
locomotive
and
to
throw
the
ordered
machinery
into
a
blackened
blazing
bloody
tangle
of
ruin
his
lips
uttered
a
wild
cry
he
jumped
across
the
river
and
ran
two
prodigious
steps
then
he
stopped
the
train
went
on
unharmed
hugo
shuddered
if
the
world
did
not
want
him
he
would
leave
the
world
perhaps
he
was
a
menace
to
it
perhaps
he
should
kill
himself
but
his
burning
sickened
heart
refused
once
more
to
give
up
frenzy
departed
then
numbness
in
its
place
came
a
fresh
hope
new
determination
hugo
danner
would
do
his
utmost
until
the
end
meanwhile
he
would
remove
himself
some
distance
from
the
civilization
that
had
tortured
him
he
would
go
away
and
find
a
new
dream
the
sound
of
the
locomotive
was
dead
in
the
distance
he
crossed
the
river
on
a
bridge
and
went
back
to
his
house
he
felt
strong
again
and
glad
glad
because
he
had
won
an
obscure
victory
glad
because
the
farce
of
his
quest
in
political
government
had
ended
with
no
tragic
dénouement
they
were
electrocuting
davidoff
and
pletzky
that
day
the
news
scarcely
interested
hugo
the
part
he
had
very
nearly
played
in
the
affair
seemed
like
the
folly
of
a
dimly
remembered
acquaintance
the
relief
of
resigning
that
impossible
purpose
overwhelmed
him
he
dismissed
his
servants
closed
his
house
and
boarded
a
train
when
the
locomotive
pounded
through
the
station
he
suffered
a
momentary
pang
he
sat
in
a
seat
with
people
all
around
him
he
was
tranquil
and
almost
content
xxiii
hugo
had
no
friends
one
single
individual
whom
he
loved
whom
he
could
have
taken
fully
into
his
confidence
might
in
a
measure
have
resolved
his
whole
life
yet
so
intense
was
the
pressure
that
had
conditioned
him
that
he
invariably
retreated
before
the
rare
opportunities
for
such
confidences
he
had
known
many
persons
well
his
father
and
mother
anna
blake
lefty
foresman
charlotte
iris
tom
shayne
roseanne
even
skorvsky
but
none
of
them
had
known
him
his
friendlessness
was
responsible
for
a
melancholy
yearning
to
remain
with
his
kind
having
already
determined
to
go
away
he
sought
for
a
kind
of
compromise
he
did
not
want
to
be
in
new
york
or
washington
or
any
other
city
the
landscape
of
america
was
haunted
for
him
he
would
leave
it
but
he
would
not
open
himself
to
the
cruel
longing
for
his
own
language
the
sight
of
familiar
customs
and
manners
from
his
hotel
in
new
york
he
made
excursions
to
various
steamship
agencies
and
travel
bureaus
he
had
seen
many
lands
and
his
demanded
novelty
for
days
he
was
undecided
it
was
a
chance
group
of
photographs
in
a
sunday
newspaper
that
excited
his
first
real
interest
one
of
the
pictures
was
of
a
man
erect
tanned
professor
daniel
hardin
a
procession
of
letters
head
of
the
new
expedition
to
yucatan
the
other
pictures
were
of
ruined
temples
unpiled
stone
causeways
jungle
he
thought
instantly
that
he
would
like
to
attach
himself
to
the
party
many
factors
combined
to
make
the
withdrawal
offered
by
an
expedition
ideal
the
more
hugo
thought
about
it
the
more
excited
he
became
the
very
nascency
of
a
fresh
objective
was
accompanied
by
and
crowded
with
new
hints
for
himself
and
his
problems
the
expedition
would
take
him
away
from
his
tribulations
and
it
would
not
entirely
cut
him
off
from
his
kind
professor
hardin
had
both
the
face
and
the
fame
of
a
distinguished
man
a
thought
that
had
been
in
the
archives
of
his
mind
for
many
months
came
sharply
into
relief
of
all
human
beings
alive
the
scientists
were
the
only
ones
who
retained
imagination
ideals
and
a
sincere
interest
in
the
larger
world
it
was
to
them
he
should
give
his
allegiance
not
to
the
statesmen
not
to
industry
or
commerce
or
war
hugo
felt
that
in
one
quick
glimpse
he
had
made
a
long
step
forward
another
concept
far
more
fantastic
and
in
a
way
even
more
intriguing
dawned
in
his
mind
as
he
read
accounts
of
the
maya
ruins
which
were
to
be
excavated
the
world
was
cluttered
with
these
great
lumps
of
incredible
architecture
walls
had
been
builded
by
primitive
man
temples
hanging
gardens
obelisks
pyramids
palaces
bridges
terraces
roads
all
of
them
gigantic
and
all
of
them
defying
the
penetration
of
archæology
to
find
the
manner
of
their
creation
was
it
not
possible
hugo
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
in
their
strange
combination
of
ignorance
and
brilliance
the
ancients
had
stumbled
upon
the
secret
of
human
strength
his
secret
had
not
those
antique
and
migratory
peoples
carried
with
them
the
formula
which
could
be
poured
into
the
veins
of
slaves
making
them
stronger
than
engines
and
was
it
not
conceivable
that
as
their
civilizations
crumbled
the
secret
was
lost
together
with
so
many
other
formulæ
of
knowledge
he
could
imagine
plumed
and
painted
priests
with
prayer
and
sacrifice
cutting
open
the
veins
of
prehistoric
mothers
and
pouring
in
the
magic
potion
when
the
babies
grew
they
could
raise
up
the
pyramids
walls
and
temples
they
could
do
it
rapidly
and
easily
a
great
enigma
was
thus
resolved
he
set
out
immediately
to
locate
professor
hardin
and
with
difficulty
arranged
an
interview
with
him
preparations
for
the
expedition
were
being
carried
on
in
an
ordinary
new
york
business
office
a
secretary
announced
hugo
and
he
was
conducted
before
the
professor
daniel
hardin
was
no
dusty
pedagogue
his
knowledge
was
profound
and
academic
his
books
were
authoritative
but
in
himself
he
belonged
to
the
type
of
man
certain
to
succeed
whatever
his
choice
of
occupation
much
of
his
life
had
been
spent
in
field
work
arduous
toil
in
bizarre
lands
where
life
depended
sometimes
on
tact
and
sometimes
on
military
strategy
he
appraised
hugo
shrewdly
before
he
spoke
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
danner
hugo
came
directly
to
the
point
i
should
like
to
join
your
yucatan
expedition
professor
hardin
smiled
i
sorry
we
full
up
i
be
glad
to
go
in
any
capacity
have
you
special
qualifications
knowledge
of
the
language
of
archæology
no
the
professor
picked
up
a
tray
of
letters
these
letters
more
than
three
hundred
are
all
from
young
men
and
women
who
would
like
to
join
my
expedition
i
think
i
should
be
useful
hugo
said
and
then
he
played
his
trump
and
i
should
be
willing
to
contribute
for
the
favour
of
being
included
a
sum
of
fifty
thousand
dollars
professor
hardin
whistled
then
his
eyes
narrowed
what
your
object
young
man
treasure
no
a
life
let
us
say
with
ample
means
at
my
disposal
and
no
definite
purpose
boredom
then
he
smiled
a
lot
of
these
other
young
men
are
independently
wealthy
and
bored
i
must
say
i
feel
sorry
for
your
generation
but
no
i
ca
accept
we
are
already
adequately
financed
hugo
smiled
in
response
then
perhaps
i
could
organize
my
own
party
and
camp
near
you
that
would
hamper
me
then
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
good
lord
you
are
determined
i
have
decided
i
am
familiar
with
the
jungle
i
am
an
athlete
i
speak
a
little
spanish
enough
to
boss
a
labour
gang
i
propose
to
assist
you
in
that
way
as
well
as
financially
i
will
make
any
contract
with
you
that
you
desire
and
attach
no
strings
whatever
to
my
money
professor
hardin
pondered
for
a
long
time
his
eyes
twinkled
when
he
replied
you
wo
believe
it
but
i
do
give
a
damn
for
your
money
not
that
it
would
assist
us
but
the
fact
is
i
could
use
a
man
like
you
anybody
could
i
take
you
and
you
can
keep
your
money
there
will
be
a
check
in
the
mail
hugo
answered
the
professor
stood
we
hoping
to
get
away
in
three
weeks
leave
your
address
with
my
secretary
and
i
send
a
list
of
the
things
you
want
for
your
kit
he
held
out
his
hand
and
hugo
shook
it
when
he
had
gone
the
professor
looked
over
the
and
swore
gleefully
to
himself
hugo
discovered
after
the
ship
sailed
that
everyone
called
professor
hardin
dan
and
they
used
hugo
first
name
from
the
second
day
out
dan
hardin
was
too
busy
to
be
very
friendly
with
any
of
the
members
of
his
party
during
the
voyage
but
they
themselves
fraternized
continually
there
were
deck
games
and
card
games
there
were
long
and
erudite
arguments
about
the
people
whom
they
were
going
to
study
what
was
the
mayan
time
cycle
and
did
it
correspond
to
the
egyptian
sothic
cycle
or
the
greek
metonic
cycle
where
did
the
mayans
get
their
jade
did
they
come
from
asia
over
bering
strait
or
were
they
a
colony
of
atlantis
when
they
knew
so
much
about
engineering
why
did
they
not
use
the
keystone
arch
and
the
wheel
why
was
their
civilization
decadent
finished
when
the
discovered
it
how
old
were
they
four
thousand
years
or
twelve
thousand
years
there
were
innumerable
other
debates
to
which
hugo
listened
like
a
man
the
cold
atlantic
winds
were
transformed
overnight
to
the
balm
of
the
gulf
stream
presently
they
passed
the
west
indies
which
lay
on
the
water
like
marine
jewels
ages
turned
back
through
the
days
of
buccaneering
to
the
more
remote
times
in
the
port
of
xantl
a
rickety
wharf
a
single
white
man
a
zinc
bar
and
a
storehouse
filled
with
chicle
blocks
marked
off
the
realm
of
the
twentieth
century
the
ship
anchored
during
the
next
year
it
would
make
two
voyages
back
to
the
homeland
for
supplies
but
the
explorers
would
not
emerge
from
the
jungle
in
that
time
an
antiquated
locomotive
which
rocked
along
over
treacherous
rails
carried
them
inland
the
scientists
became
silent
and
pensive
in
another
car
the
maya
indians
who
were
to
do
the
manual
labour
chattered
incessantly
in
their
explosive
tongue
at
the
last
stop
they
disembarked
slept
through
an
night
and
entered
the
jungle
for
three
weeks
they
hacked
and
hewed
their
way
forward
the
vegetation
closed
behind
them
cutting
off
the
universe
as
completely
as
the
submerging
waves
of
the
sea
it
was
hot
difficult
work
to
which
hugo
lent
himself
with
an
energy
that
astounded
even
hardin
who
had
judged
him
valuable
one
day
when
the
high
mountains
loomed
into
view
hugo
caught
his
first
glimpse
of
uctotol
the
sacred
city
a
creeper
on
the
hillside
fell
before
his
machete
then
another
a
hole
in
the
green
wall
and
there
it
stood
shining
white
huge
desolate
still
as
the
grave
his
arm
hung
in
over
him
passed
the
mystic
feeling
of
familiarity
that
fugitive
sense
of
recognition
which
springs
so
readily
into
a
belief
in
immortality
it
seemed
to
him
during
that
staggering
instant
that
he
knew
every
contour
of
those
great
structures
that
he
had
run
in
the
streets
lived
loved
died
there
that
he
could
almost
remember
the
names
and
faces
of
its
inhabitants
dead
for
thousands
of
years
that
he
could
nearly
recall
the
language
and
the
music
that
destiny
itself
had
arranged
a
the
vision
died
he
gave
a
great
shout
the
others
rushed
to
his
side
and
found
him
trembling
and
pointing
tons
of
verdure
were
cut
down
and
pushed
aside
a
hacienda
was
constructed
and
a
camp
for
the
labourers
then
the
shovels
and
picks
were
broken
from
their
boxes
the
scientists
arranged
their
paraphernalia
and
the
work
began
interrupted
frequently
by
the
exultant
shouts
that
marked
a
new
finding
no
one
regretted
hugo
he
made
his
men
work
magically
his
example
was
a
challenge
he
could
do
more
than
any
of
them
and
his
hair
and
eyes
black
as
their
own
his
granite
face
stern
and
indefatigable
gave
him
a
natural
dominion
over
them
all
this
the
dark
starlit
plushy
nights
with
their
hypnotic
silences
the
vivid
days
of
toil
the
patient
and
men
was
respite
to
hugo
it
salved
his
tribulations
it
brought
him
to
a
gradual
assurance
that
any
work
with
such
men
would
be
sufficient
for
him
he
was
going
backward
into
the
world
instead
of
forward
that
did
not
matter
he
stood
on
the
frontier
of
human
knowledge
he
was
a
factor
in
its
preparation
and
if
what
they
carried
back
with
them
was
no
more
than
history
if
it
cast
no
new
light
on
existing
wants
and
perplexities
it
still
served
a
splendid
purpose
months
rolled
by
unheeded
hugo
gathered
friends
among
these
men
and
the
greatest
of
those
friends
was
daniel
hardin
in
their
isolation
and
occasional
loneliness
each
of
them
little
by
little
stripped
his
past
for
the
others
only
hugo
remained
silent
about
himself
until
his
reticence
was
conspicuous
he
might
never
have
spoken
except
for
the
accident
it
was
in
itself
a
little
thing
which
happened
apart
from
the
main
field
of
activity
hugo
and
two
indians
were
at
work
on
a
small
temple
at
the
city
fringe
hardin
came
down
to
see
the
great
stone
in
the
roof
crumbled
by
ages
slipped
and
teetered
underneath
the
professor
stood
unheeding
but
hugo
saw
he
caught
the
mass
of
rock
in
his
arms
and
lifted
it
to
one
side
and
dan
hardin
turned
in
time
to
perceive
the
full
miracle
when
hugo
lifted
his
head
he
knew
yet
to
his
astonishment
there
was
no
look
of
fear
in
hardin
blue
eyes
instead
they
were
moderately
surprised
vastly
interested
he
did
not
speak
for
some
time
then
he
said
thanks
danner
i
believe
you
saved
my
life
should
you
mind
picking
up
that
rock
again
hugo
dismissed
the
indians
with
a
few
words
he
glanced
again
at
hardin
to
make
sure
of
his
composure
then
he
lifted
the
square
stone
back
to
its
position
hardin
was
thinking
aloud
that
stone
must
weigh
four
tons
no
man
alive
can
handle
four
tons
like
that
how
do
you
do
it
hugo
hot
streaming
sun
tumbled
débris
this
profound
question
asked
again
asked
mildly
for
the
first
time
my
father
was
a
biologist
a
great
biologist
i
was
an
experiment
good
lord
and
and
that
why
you
kept
your
past
dark
hugo
of
course
not
many
people
survive
the
shock
you
forget
that
we
here
are
all
scientists
i
wo
press
you
perhaps
hugo
heard
himself
saying
i
like
to
tell
you
in
that
case
in
my
room
i
should
like
to
hear
that
night
after
a
day
of
indecision
hugo
sat
in
a
dim
light
and
poured
out
the
story
of
his
life
hardin
never
interrupted
never
commented
until
the
end
then
he
said
softly
you
poor
devil
oh
you
poor
bastard
and
hugo
saw
that
he
was
weeping
he
tried
to
laugh
it
is
as
bad
as
that
dan
son
his
voice
choked
with
emotion
this
thing
this
is
my
this
is
why
you
came
to
my
office
last
winter
this
is
the
most
important
thing
on
earth
what
a
story
what
a
man
you
are
on
the
contrary
do
be
modest
i
know
i
feel
i
understand
hugo
head
shook
sadly
perhaps
not
you
can
see
i
have
tried
everything
in
itself
it
is
great
i
can
see
that
it
is
objectively
the
most
important
thing
on
earth
but
the
other
way
what
can
i
do
tell
me
that
you
can
not
tell
me
i
can
destroy
as
nothing
that
ever
came
before
or
will
come
again
i
can
destroy
but
destruction
as
i
believe
as
you
believe
is
at
best
only
a
step
toward
and
what
can
i
make
afterwards
think
think
man
rack
your
brains
what
his
hands
clenched
and
unclenched
i
can
build
great
halls
and
palaces
futile
i
can
make
bridges
i
can
rip
open
mountains
and
take
out
the
gold
i
am
that
strong
it
is
as
if
my
metabolism
was
atomic
instead
of
molecular
but
what
of
it
stretch
your
imagination
to
its
uttermost
limits
and
what
can
i
do
that
is
more
than
an
affair
of
petty
profit
to
myself
mankind
has
already
extended
its
senses
and
its
muscles
to
their
tenth
powers
he
can
already
command
engines
to
do
what
i
can
do
it
is
not
necessary
that
he
become
an
engine
himself
it
is
preposterous
that
he
should
think
of
it
even
to
transcend
his
engines
i
defy
you
i
defy
you
with
all
my
strength
to
think
of
what
i
can
do
to
justify
myself
the
words
had
been
wrung
from
hugo
perspiration
trickled
down
his
face
he
bit
his
lips
to
check
himself
the
older
man
was
grave
all
your
emotions
your
reflections
your
yearnings
and
passions
come
to
that
and
yet
look
at
me
in
another
light
hugo
went
on
i
tried
to
give
you
an
inkling
of
it
you
were
the
first
who
saw
what
i
could
do
glimpsed
a
fraction
of
it
rather
and
into
whose
face
did
not
come
fear
loathing
even
hate
try
to
live
with
a
sense
of
that
i
can
remember
almost
back
to
the
cradle
that
same
thing
first
it
was
envy
and
jealousy
then
as
i
grew
stronger
it
was
fear
alarm
and
the
thing
that
comes
from
fear
hatred
that
is
another
and
perhaps
a
greater
obstacle
if
i
found
something
to
do
the
whole
universe
would
be
against
me
these
little
people
can
you
imagine
what
it
is
to
be
me
and
to
look
at
people
a
crowd
at
a
ball
game
a
parade
can
you
great
god
the
scientist
breathed
when
i
see
them
for
what
they
are
and
when
they
exert
the
tremendous
bulk
of
their
united
detestation
and
denial
against
me
when
i
feel
rage
rising
inside
myself
can
you
conceive
that
enough
i
do
want
to
try
to
think
not
of
that
i
shall
i
walk
to
my
grave
afraid
that
i
shall
let
go
of
myself
searching
everywhere
for
something
to
absorb
my
energy
shall
i
no
the
professor
spoke
with
a
firm
concentration
hugo
arrested
himself
then
what
did
it
ever
dawn
on
you
that
you
had
missed
your
purpose
entirely
the
words
were
like
cold
water
to
hugo
he
pulled
himself
together
with
a
physical
effort
and
replied
you
mean
that
i
have
not
guessed
it
so
far
precisely
it
never
occurred
to
me
not
that
i
had
missed
it
entirely
you
have
then
for
the
love
of
god
what
is
it
hardin
smiled
a
gentle
wise
smile
easy
there
i
tell
you
and
listen
well
hugo
because
i
feel
inspired
the
reason
you
have
missed
it
is
simple
you
tried
to
do
everything
on
the
contrary
every
kind
of
assistance
i
have
enlisted
has
failed
me
utterly
except
one
kind
science
no
your
own
kind
hugo
the
words
did
not
convey
their
meaning
for
several
seconds
then
hugo
gasped
you
mean
other
men
like
me
exactly
other
men
like
you
not
one
or
two
scores
hundreds
and
women
all
picked
with
the
utmost
care
eugenic
offspring
cultivated
and
reared
in
secret
by
a
society
for
the
purpose
not
necessarily
your
children
but
the
children
of
the
best
parents
perfect
bodies
intellectual
minds
your
strength
do
you
see
it
hugo
you
are
not
the
reformer
of
the
old
world
you
are
the
beginning
of
the
new
we
begin
with
a
thousand
of
you
living
by
yourselves
and
multiplying
you
produce
your
own
arts
and
industries
and
ideals
the
new
titans
then
slowly
you
dominate
the
world
conquer
and
stamp
out
all
these
things
to
which
you
and
i
and
all
men
of
intelligence
object
in
the
end
you
are
alone
and
supreme
hugo
groaned
to
make
a
thousand
men
live
my
life
but
they
will
not
suppose
you
had
been
proud
of
your
strength
suppose
you
had
not
been
compelled
to
keep
it
a
secret
suppose
you
could
have
found
glorious
uses
for
it
from
childhood
in
the
mountains
hugo
whispered
his
eyes
bemused
where
the
sun
is
warm
and
the
days
long
these
children
growing
even
here
in
this
place
so
i
thought
do
you
see
hugo
yes
i
see
at
last
thank
god
i
do
see
for
a
long
time
their
thoughts
ran
wild
when
they
cooled
it
was
to
formulate
plans
a
child
taken
here
another
there
a
city
in
the
jungle
the
jungle
had
harboured
races
before
not
only
these
mayas
but
the
incas
khmers
and
others
a
modern
city
for
dwellings
and
these
tremendous
ruins
would
be
the
blocks
for
the
nursery
they
would
teach
them
art
and
architecture
and
science
engineering
medicine
their
own
undiscovered
medicine
the
new
titans
the
sons
of
dawn
so
ran
their
inspired
imaginations
when
the
night
was
far
advanced
and
the
camp
was
wrapped
in
slumber
they
made
a
truce
with
this
divine
fire
they
shook
each
other
hands
hugo
and
we
go
over
the
notes
i
bring
them
till
evening
then
hugo
lay
on
his
bed
more
ecstatic
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
by
and
by
he
slept
then
as
if
the
ghosts
of
uctotol
had
risen
his
mind
was
troubled
by
a
host
a
pageant
of
dreams
he
turned
in
his
sleep
rending
his
blankets
he
moaned
and
mumbled
when
he
woke
he
understood
that
his
soul
had
undergone
another
of
its
diametric
inversions
the
mad
fancies
of
the
night
before
had
died
and
memory
could
not
rekindle
them
little
dreads
had
goaded
away
their
brightness
conscience
was
bickering
inside
him
humanity
was
content
it
would
hate
his
new
race
and
the
new
race
being
itself
human
might
grow
with
power
if
his
theory
about
the
great
builders
of
the
past
was
true
then
perhaps
this
incubus
would
explain
why
the
past
was
no
more
if
his
titans
disagreed
and
made
war
on
each
other
surely
that
would
end
the
earth
he
quailed
overcome
by
a
desire
to
think
more
about
this
giants
scheme
he
avoided
hardin
in
the
siesta
hour
he
went
back
to
his
tent
and
procured
the
books
wherein
his
father
had
written
the
second
secret
of
life
he
crammed
them
into
his
pocket
and
broke
through
the
jungle
when
he
was
beyond
sight
and
sound
he
dropped
his
machete
and
made
his
way
as
none
but
he
could
do
with
his
body
he
cut
a
swath
toward
the
mountains
and
emerged
from
the
green
veil
on
to
the
bare
rocks
panting
and
hot
upward
he
climbed
until
he
had
gained
the
summit
to
the
west
were
strewn
the
frozen
billows
of
the
range
to
the
east
a
limitless
sea
of
verdure
at
his
feet
the
ruins
in
neat
miniature
like
a
model
above
scalding
sun
and
blue
sky
around
him
a
wind
strangely
chill
and
silence
he
sat
with
his
head
on
his
hands
until
his
thoughts
were
disturbed
a
humid
breath
had
risen
sluggishly
from
the
jungle
floor
the
sun
was
dull
looking
toward
the
horizon
he
could
see
a
black
cloud
for
an
instant
he
was
frightened
the
transformation
had
been
so
gigantic
and
so
soundless
he
knew
a
sudden
urgent
impulse
to
go
back
to
the
valley
he
disobeyed
it
and
watched
the
coming
of
the
storm
the
first
rapier
of
lightning
through
the
bowels
of
the
approaching
cloud
warned
him
again
staunchly
he
stood
he
had
come
there
to
think
i
must
go
back
and
begin
this
work
he
told
himself
i
have
found
a
friend
the
cloud
was
descending
thunder
ruminated
in
heaven
garret
it
is
folly
he
repeated
folly
folly
folly
in
the
face
of
god
now
the
sun
went
out
like
an
extinguished
lamp
and
the
horizon
crept
closer
a
curtain
of
torrential
rain
was
lowered
in
the
north
they
will
make
the
earth
beautiful
he
said
and
ever
and
again
this
thing
is
not
beautiful
it
is
wrong
his
agitation
increased
rapidly
the
cloud
was
closing
on
the
mountain
like
a
huge
hand
the
muscles
in
his
legs
quivered
if
there
were
only
a
god
he
whispered
what
a
prayer
i
would
make
then
the
wind
came
like
a
visible
thing
pushing
its
fingers
over
the
vegetation
below
and
whirling
up
the
mountain
laden
with
dust
after
the
wind
the
rain
heavy
roaring
rain
that
fell
not
in
separate
drops
but
in
thick
streams
the
lightning
was
incessant
it
illuminated
remote
peaks
which
in
the
fury
of
the
storm
appeared
to
be
swaying
it
split
clouds
apart
and
the
hurricane
healed
the
rents
all
light
went
out
the
world
was
wrapped
in
darkness
hugo
clutched
his
precious
books
in
the
remnants
of
his
clothing
and
braced
himself
on
the
bare
rock
his
voice
roared
back
into
the
storm
the
sounds
it
gave
he
flung
one
hand
upward
now
god
oh
god
if
there
be
a
god
tell
me
can
i
defy
you
can
i
defy
your
world
is
this
your
will
or
are
you
like
all
mankind
impotent
oh
god
he
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
called
god
like
a
name
into
the
tumult
above
madness
was
upon
him
and
the
bitter
irony
with
which
his
blood
ran
black
was
within
him
a
bolt
of
lightning
stabbed
earthward
it
struck
hugo
outlining
him
in
fire
his
hand
slipped
away
from
his
mouth
his
voice
was
quenched
he
fell
to
the
ground
after
three
days
of
frantic
searching
daniel
hardin
came
upon
the
incredible
passage
through
the
jungle
and
followed
it
to
the
mountain
top
there
he
found
the
blackened
body
of
hugo
danner
lying
face
down
his
clothing
was
burned
to
ashes
and
an
accumulation
of
cinders
was
all
that
remained
of
the
notebooks
after
discovering
that
professor
hardin
could
not
forbear
to
glance
aloft
at
the
sun
and
sky
his
face
was
saddened
and
perplexed
we
will
carry
him
yonder
to
uctotol
and
bury
him
he
said
at
last
then
the
work
will
go
on
