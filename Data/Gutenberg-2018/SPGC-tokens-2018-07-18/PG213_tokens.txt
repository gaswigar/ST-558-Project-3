banjo
paterson
and
henry
lawson
were
writing
for
the
sydney
in
when
lawson
suggested
a
of
poetry
to
increase
the
number
of
poems
they
could
sell
to
the
paper
it
was
apparently
entered
into
in
all
fun
though
there
are
reports
that
lawson
was
bitter
about
it
later
defence
of
the
bush
included
in
this
selection
was
one
of
paterson
replies
to
lawson

preface
it
is
not
so
easy
to
write
ballads
descriptive
of
the
bushland
of
australia
as
on
light
consideration
would
appear
reasonably
good
verse
on
the
subject
has
been
supplied
in
sufficient
quantity
but
the
maker
of
folksongs
for
our
newborn
nation
requires
a
somewhat
rare
combination
of
gifts
and
experiences
dowered
with
the
poet
heart
he
must
yet
have
passed
his
amid
the
stern
solitude
of
the
austral
waste
must
have
ridden
the
race
in
the
township
guided
the
reckless
adown
the
mountain
spur
and
followed
the
moving
herd
the
droving
days
amid
such
scarce
congenial
surroundings
comes
oft
that
finer
sense
which
renders
visible
bright
gleams
of
humour
pathos
and
romance
which
like
undiscovered
gold
await
the
fortunate
adventurer
that
the
author
has
touched
this
not
less
delicately
than
distinctly
no
true
australian
will
deny
in
my
opinion
this
collection
comprises
the
best
bush
ballads
written
since
the
death
of
lindsay
gordon
rolf
boldrewood
a
number
of
these
verses
are
now
published
for
the
first
time
most
of
the
others
were
written
for
and
appeared
in
the
bulletin
sydney
and
are
therefore
already
widely
known
to
readers
in
australasia
a
paterson
prelude
i
have
gathered
these
stories
afar
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
in
the
land
where
the
cattle
camps
are
on
the
edge
of
the
plain
on
the
overland
routes
of
the
west
when
the
watches
were
long
i
have
fashioned
in
earnest
and
jest
these
fragments
of
song
they
are
just
the
rude
stories
one
hears
in
sadness
and
mirth
the
records
of
wandering
years
and
scant
is
their
worth
though
their
merits
indeed
are
but
slight
i
shall
not
repine
if
they
give
you
one
moment
delight
old
comrades
of
mine

was
the
way
of
it
do

there
came
a
whisper
down
the

and
dark

down
along
the
snakebite
river
where
the
overlanders
camp
ambition

you
back
from

country
mister
townsman
where
you
went
last
week
oh
the
went
to
the
back
block
run
those
names
the
shearers
sat
in
the
firelight
hearty
and
hale
and
strong
a
bush
christening
on
the
outer
barcoo
where
the
churches
are
few
how
the
favourite
beat
us
said
the
boozer
tell
you
it
true
sir
the
great
calamity
came
to
whiskeyhurst
as
i
pondered
very
weary
a
volume
long
and
dreary
under
the
shadow
of
kiley
hill
this
is
the
place
where
they
all
were
bred
jim
carew
born
of
a
thoroughbred
english
race
the
swagman
rest
we
buried
old
bob
where
the
bloodwoods
wave
the
man
from
snowy
river
and
other
verses
the
man
from
snowy
river
there
was
movement
at
the
station
for
the
word
had
passed
around
that
the
colt
from
old
regret
had
got
away
and
had
joined
the
wild
bush
horses
he
was
worth
a
thousand
pound
so
all
the
cracks
had
gathered
to
the
fray
all
the
tried
and
noted
riders
from
the
stations
near
and
far
had
mustered
at
the
homestead
overnight
for
the
bushmen
love
hard
riding
where
the
wild
bush
horses
are
and
the
snuffs
the
battle
with
delight
there
was
harrison
who
made
his
pile
when
pardon
won
the
cup
the
old
man
with
his
hair
as
white
as
snow
but
few
could
ride
beside
him
when
his
blood
was
fairly
up
he
would
go
wherever
horse
and
man
could
go
and
clancy
of
the
overflow
came
down
to
lend
a
hand
no
better
horseman
ever
held
the
reins
for
never
horse
could
throw
him
while
the
would
stand
he
learnt
to
ride
while
droving
on
the
plains
and
one
was
there
a
stripling
on
a
small
and
weedy
beast
he
was
something
like
a
racehorse
undersized
with
a
touch
of
timor
pony
three
parts
thoroughbred
at
least
and
such
as
are
by
mountain
horsemen
prized
he
was
hard
and
tough
and
wiry
just
the
sort
that
wo
say
die
there
was
courage
in
his
quick
impatient
tread
and
he
bore
the
badge
of
gameness
in
his
bright
and
fiery
eye
and
the
proud
and
lofty
carriage
of
his
head
but
still
so
slight
and
weedy
one
would
doubt
his
power
to
stay
and
the
old
man
said
horse
will
never
do
for
a
long
and
tiring
gallop
lad
you
better
stop
away
those
hills
are
far
too
rough
for
such
as
you
so
he
waited
sad
and
wistful
only
clancy
stood
his
friend
think
we
ought
to
let
him
come
he
said
warrant
he
be
with
us
when
he
wanted
at
the
end
for
both
his
horse
and
he
are
mountain
bred
hails
from
snowy
river
up
by
kosciusko
side
where
the
hills
are
twice
as
steep
and
twice
as
rough
where
a
horse
hoofs
strike
firelight
from
the
flint
stones
every
stride
the
man
that
holds
his
own
is
good
enough
and
the
snowy
river
riders
on
the
mountains
make
their
home
where
the
river
runs
those
giant
hills
between
i
have
seen
full
many
horsemen
since
i
first
commenced
to
roam
but
nowhere
yet
such
horsemen
have
i
seen
so
he
went
they
found
the
horses
by
the
big
mimosa
clump
they
raced
away
towards
the
mountain
brow
and
the
old
man
gave
his
orders
go
at
them
from
the
jump
no
use
to
try
for
fancy
riding
now
and
clancy
you
must
wheel
them
try
and
wheel
them
to
the
right
ride
boldly
lad
and
never
fear
the
spills
for
never
yet
was
rider
that
could
keep
the
mob
in
sight
if
once
they
gain
the
shelter
of
those
hills
so
clancy
rode
to
wheel
them
he
was
racing
on
the
wing
where
the
best
and
boldest
riders
take
their
place
and
he
raced
his
past
them
and
he
made
the
ranges
ring
with
the
stockwhip
as
he
met
them
face
to
face
then
they
halted
for
a
moment
while
he
swung
the
dreaded
lash
but
they
saw
their
mountain
full
in
view
and
they
charged
beneath
the
stockwhip
with
a
sharp
and
sudden
dash
and
off
into
the
mountain
scrub
they
flew
then
fast
the
horsemen
followed
where
the
gorges
deep
and
black
resounded
to
the
thunder
of
their
tread
and
the
stockwhips
woke
the
echoes
and
they
fiercely
answered
back
from
cliffs
and
crags
that
beetled
overhead
and
upward
ever
upward
the
wild
horses
held
their
way
where
mountain
ash
and
kurrajong
grew
wide
and
the
old
man
muttered
fiercely
may
bid
the
mob
good
day
man
can
hold
them
down
the
other
side
when
they
reached
the
mountain
summit
even
clancy
took
a
pull
it
well
might
make
the
boldest
hold
their
breath
the
wild
hop
scrub
grew
thickly
and
the
hidden
ground
was
full
of
wombat
holes
and
any
slip
was
death
but
the
man
from
snowy
river
let
the
pony
have
his
head
and
he
swung
his
stockwhip
round
and
gave
a
cheer
and
he
raced
him
down
the
mountain
like
a
torrent
down
its
bed
while
the
others
stood
and
watched
in
very
fear
he
sent
the
flint
stones
flying
but
the
pony
kept
his
feet
he
cleared
the
fallen
timber
in
his
stride
and
the
man
from
snowy
river
never
shifted
in
his
seat
it
was
grand
to
see
that
mountain
horseman
ride
through
the
stringy
barks
and
saplings
on
the
rough
and
broken
ground
down
the
hillside
at
a
racing
pace
he
went
and
he
never
drew
the
bridle
till
he
landed
safe
and
sound
at
the
bottom
of
that
terrible
descent
he
was
right
among
the
horses
as
they
climbed
the
further
hill
and
the
watchers
on
the
mountain
standing
mute
saw
him
ply
the
stockwhip
fiercely
he
was
right
among
them
still
as
he
raced
across
the
clearing
in
pursuit
then
they
lost
him
for
a
moment
where
two
mountain
gullies
met
in
the
ranges
but
a
final
glimpse
reveals
on
a
dim
and
distant
hillside
the
wild
horses
racing
yet
with
the
man
from
snowy
river
at
their
heels
and
he
ran
them
till
their
sides
were
white
with
foam
he
followed
like
a
bloodhound
on
their
track
till
they
halted
cowed
and
beaten
then
he
turned
their
heads
for
home
and
alone
and
unassisted
brought
them
back
but
his
hardy
mountain
pony
he
could
scarcely
raise
a
trot
he
was
blood
from
hip
to
shoulder
from
the
spur
but
his
pluck
was
still
undaunted
and
his
courage
fiery
hot
for
never
yet
was
mountain
horse
a
cur
and
down
by
kosciusko
where
the
ridges
raise
their
torn
and
rugged
battlements
on
high
where
the
air
is
clear
as
crystal
and
the
white
stars
fairly
blaze
at
midnight
in
the
cold
and
frosty
sky
and
where
around
the
overflow
the
reedbeds
sweep
and
sway
to
the
breezes
and
the
rolling
plains
are
wide
the
man
from
snowy
river
is
a
household
word
and
the
stockmen
tell
the
story
of
his
ride
old
pardon
the
son
of
reprieve
you
never
heard
tell
of
the
story
well
now
i
can
hardly
believe
never
heard
of
the
honour
and
glory
of
pardon
the
son
of
reprieve
but
maybe
you
only
a
johnnie
and
do
know
a
horse
from
a
hoe
well
well
do
get
angry
my
sonny
but
really
a
young
un
should
know
they
bred
him
out
back
on
the
his
mother
was
mameluke
breed
to
the
front
and
then
stay
there
was
ever
the
root
of
the
mameluke
creed
he
seemed
to
inherit
their
wiry
strong
frames
and
their
pluck
to
receive
as
hard
as
a
flint
and
as
fiery
was
pardon
the
son
of
reprieve
we
ran
him
at
many
a
meeting
at
crossing
and
gully
and
town
and
nothing
could
give
him
a
beating
at
least
when
our
money
was
down
for
weight
would
stop
him
nor
distance
nor
odds
though
the
others
were
fast
he
race
with
a
dogged
persistence
and
wear
them
all
down
at
the
last
at
the
turon
the
yattendon
filly
led
by
lengths
at
the
and
we
all
began
to
look
silly
while
crowd
were
starting
to
laugh
but
the
old
horse
came
faster
and
faster
his
pluck
told
its
tale
and
his
strength
he
gained
on
her
caught
her
and
passed
her
and
won
it
by
a
length
and
then
we
swooped
down
on
menindie
to
run
for
the
president
cup
oh
that
a
sweet
township
a
shindy
to
them
is
board
lodging
and
sup
they
are
and
their
system
is
never
to
suffer
defeat
it
tie
or
wrangle
to
best
you
must
lose
or
else
it
heat
we
strolled
down
the
township
and
found
at
drinking
and
gaming
and
play
if
sorrows
they
had
why
they
drowned
and
betting
was
soon
under
way
their
horses
were
good
and
fit
there
was
plenty
of
cash
in
the
town
they
backed
their
own
horses
like
britons
and
lord
how
rattled
it
down
with
gladness
we
thought
of
the
morrow
we
counted
our
wagers
with
glee
a
simile
homely
to
borrow
was
plenty
of
milk
in
our
tea
you
see
we
were
green
and
we
never
had
even
a
thought
of
foul
play
though
we
well
might
have
known
that
the
clever
division
would
us
away
experience
they
tell
us
at
least
so
i
frequently
heard
but
or
those
fellows
were
up
to
each
move
on
the
board
they
got
to
his
stall
it
is
sinful
to
think
what
such
villains
would
do
and
they
gave
him
a
regular
skinful
of
barley
green
barley
to
chew
he
munched
it
all
night
and
we
found
him
next
morning
as
full
as
a
hog
the
girths
would
nearly
meet
round
him
he
looked
like
an
overfed
frog
we
saw
we
were
done
like
a
dinner
the
odds
were
a
thousand
to
one
against
pardon
turning
up
winner
was
cruel
to
ask
him
to
run
we
got
to
the
course
with
our
troubles
a
crestfallen
couple
were
we
and
we
heard
the
calling
the
doubles
a
roar
like
the
surf
of
the
sea
and
over
the
tumult
and
louder
rang
price
pardon
i
lay
says
jimmy
children
of
judah
are
out
on
the
warpath
three
miles
in
three
heats
ah
my
sonny
the
horses
in
those
days
were
stout
they
had
to
run
well
to
win
money
i
do
see
such
horses
about
your
vermin
that
scamper
with
their
up
they
would
earn
much
of
their
damper
in
a
race
like
the
president
cup
the
first
heat
was
soon
set
the
dancer
went
off
to
the
front
the
don
on
his
quarters
was
showing
with
pardon
right
out
of
the
hunt
he
rolled
and
he
weltered
and
wallowed
you
kick
your
hat
faster
i
bet
they
finished
all
bunched
and
he
followed
all
lathered
and
dripping
with
sweat
but
troubles
came
thicker
upon
us
for
while
we
were
rubbing
him
dry
the
stewards
came
over
to
warn
us
hear
you
are
running
a
bye
if
pardon
do
spiel
like
tarnation
and
win
the
next
heat
if
he
can
he
earn
a
disqualification
just
think
over
now
my
man
our
money
all
gone
and
our
credit
our
horse
could
gallop
a
yard
and
then
people
thought
that
did
it
it
really
was
terribly
hard
we
were
objects
of
mirth
and
derision
to
folk
in
the
lawn
and
the
stand
and
the
yells
of
the
clever
division
of
price
pardon
were
grand
we
still
had
a
chance
for
the
money
two
heats
still
remained
to
be
run
if
both
fell
to
us
why
my
sonny
the
clever
division
were
done
and
pardon
was
better
we
reckoned
his
sickness
was
passing
away
so
he
went
to
the
post
for
the
second
and
principal
heat
of
the
day
they
off
and
away
with
a
rattle
like
dogs
from
the
leashes
let
slip
and
right
at
the
back
of
the
battle
he
followed
them
under
the
whip
they
gained
ten
good
lengths
on
him
quickly
he
dropped
right
away
from
the
pack
i
tell
you
it
made
me
feel
sickly
to
see
the
blue
jacket
fall
back
our
very
last
hope
had
departed
we
thought
the
old
fellow
was
done
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
started
to
go
like
a
shot
from
a
gun
his
chances
seemed
slight
to
embolden
our
hearts
but
with
teeth
firmly
set
we
thought
or
never
the
old
may
reckon
with
some
of
yet
then
loud
rose
the
for
pardon
he
swept
like
the
wind
down
the
dip
and
over
the
rise
by
the
garden
the
jockey
was
done
with
the
whip
the
field
were
at
sixes
and
sevens
the
pace
at
the
first
had
been
fast
and
hope
seemed
to
drop
from
the
heavens
for
pardon
was
coming
at
last
and
how
he
did
come
it
was
splendid
he
gained
on
them
yards
every
bound
stretching
out
like
a
greyhound
extended
his
girth
laid
right
down
on
the
ground
a
shimmer
of
silk
in
the
cedars
as
into
the
running
they
wheeled
and
out
flashed
the
whips
on
the
leaders
for
pardon
had
collared
the
field
then
right
through
the
ruck
he
came
sailing
i
knew
that
the
battle
was
won
the
son
of
haphazard
was
failing
the
yattendon
filly
was
done
he
cut
down
the
don
and
the
dancer
he
raced
clean
away
from
the
mare
he
in
front
catch
him
now
if
you
can
sir
and
up
went
my
hat
in
the
air
then
loud
from
the
lawn
and
the
garden
rose
offers
of
to
one
bet
on
the
field
i
back
pardon
no
use
all
the
money
was
gone
he
came
for
the
third
heat
and
dancing
about
the
others
were
done
ere
they
started
crestfallen
and
tired
and
worn
out
he
won
it
and
ran
it
much
faster
than
even
the
first
i
believe
oh
he
was
the
daddy
the
master
was
pardon
the
son
of
reprieve
he
showed
the
method
to
travel
the
boy
sat
as
still
as
a
stone
they
never
could
see
him
for
gravel
he
came
in
and
alone
but
he
old
and
his
eyes
are
grown
hollow
like
me
with
my
thatch
of
the
snow
when
he
dies
then
i
hope
i
may
follow
and
go
where
the
racehorses
go
i
do
want
no
harping
nor
singing
such
things
with
my
style
do
agree
where
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
are
ringing
there
music
sufficient
for
me
and
surely
the
thoroughbred
horses
will
rise
up
again
and
begin
fresh
races
on
courses
and
they
might
let
me
slip
in
it
would
look
rather
well
the
on
cherubs
and
seraphs
and
things
harrison
black
gelding
pardon
blue
halo
white
body
and
wings
and
if
they
have
racing
hereafter
and
who
is
to
say
they
will
not
when
the
cheers
and
the
shouting
and
laughter
proclaim
that
the
battle
grows
hot
as
they
come
down
the
racecourse
he
rush
to
the
front
i
believe
and
you
hear
the
great
multitude
cheering
for
pardon
the
son
of
reprieve
clancy
of
the
overflow
i
had
written
him
a
letter
which
i
had
for
want
of
better
knowledge
sent
to
where
i
met
him
down
the
lachlan
years
ago
he
was
shearing
when
i
knew
him
so
i
sent
the
letter
to
him
just
spec
addressed
as
follows
of
the
overflow
and
an
answer
came
directed
in
a
writing
unexpected
and
i
think
the
same
was
written
with
a
dipped
in
tar
was
his
shearing
mate
who
wrote
it
and
verbatim
i
will
quote
it
gone
to
queensland
droving
and
we
do
know
where
he
are
in
my
wild
erratic
fancy
visions
come
to
me
of
clancy
gone
the
cooper
where
the
western
drovers
go
as
the
stock
are
slowly
stringing
clancy
rides
behind
them
singing
for
the
drover
life
has
pleasures
that
the
townsfolk
never
know
and
the
bush
hath
friends
to
meet
him
and
their
kindly
voices
greet
him
in
the
murmur
of
the
breezes
and
the
river
on
its
bars
and
he
sees
the
vision
splendid
of
the
sunlit
plains
extended
and
at
night
the
glory
of
the
everlasting
stars
i
am
sitting
in
my
dingy
little
office
where
a
stingy
ray
of
sunlight
struggles
feebly
down
between
the
houses
tall
and
the
foetid
air
and
gritty
of
the
dusty
dirty
city
through
the
open
window
floating
spreads
its
foulness
over
all
and
in
place
of
lowing
cattle
i
can
hear
the
fiendish
rattle
of
the
tramways
and
the
making
hurry
down
the
street
and
the
language
uninviting
of
the
gutter
children
fighting
comes
fitfully
and
faintly
through
the
ceaseless
tramp
of
feet
and
the
hurrying
people
daunt
me
and
their
pallid
faces
haunt
me
as
they
shoulder
one
another
in
their
rush
and
nervous
haste
with
their
eager
eyes
and
greedy
and
their
stunted
forms
and
weedy
for
townsfolk
have
no
time
to
grow
they
have
no
time
to
waste
and
i
somehow
rather
fancy
that
i
like
to
change
with
clancy
like
to
take
a
turn
at
droving
where
the
seasons
come
and
go
while
he
faced
the
round
eternal
of
the
and
the
journal
but
i
doubt
he
suit
the
office
clancy
of
overflow
conroy
gap
this
was
the
way
of
it
do
you
know
ryan
was
for
stealing
sheep
and
never
a
trooper
high
or
low
could
find
him
catch
a
weasel
asleep
till
trooper
scott
from
the
stockman
ford
a
bushman
too
as
i
heard
them
tell
chanced
to
find
him
drunk
as
a
lord
round
at
the
shadow
of
death
hotel
know
the
place
it
a
wayside
inn
a
low
a
bushman
trap
hiding
away
in
its
shame
and
sin
under
the
shelter
of
conroy
gap
under
the
shade
of
that
frowning
range
the
roughest
crowd
that
ever
drew
breath
thieves
and
rowdies
uncouth
and
strange
were
mustered
round
at
the
shadow
of
death
the
trooper
knew
that
his
man
would
slide
like
a
dingo
pup
if
he
saw
the
chance
and
with
half
a
start
on
the
mountain
side
ryan
would
lead
him
a
merry
dance
drunk
as
he
was
when
the
trooper
came
to
him
that
did
not
matter
a
rap
drunk
or
sober
he
was
the
same
the
boldest
rider
in
conroy
gap
want
you
ryan
the
trooper
said
listen
to
me
if
you
dare
resist
so
help
me
heaven
i
shoot
you
dead
he
snapped
the
steel
on
his
prisoner
wrist
and
ryan
hearing
the
handcuffs
click
recovered
his
wits
as
they
turned
to
go
for
fright
will
sober
a
man
as
quick
as
all
the
drugs
that
the
doctors
know
there
was
a
girl
in
that
rough
bar
went
by
the
name
of
kate
carew
quiet
and
shy
as
the
bush
girls
are
but
and
plucky
too
she
loved
this
ryan
or
so
they
say
and
passing
by
while
her
eyes
were
dim
with
tears
she
said
in
a
careless
way
swagman
round
in
the
stable
jim
spoken
too
low
for
the
trooper
ear
why
should
she
care
if
he
heard
or
not
plenty
of
swagmen
far
and
near
and
yet
to
ryan
it
meant
a
lot
that
was
the
name
of
the
grandest
horse
in
all
the
district
from
east
to
west
in
every
show
ring
on
every
course
they
always
counted
the
swagman
best
he
was
a
wonder
a
raking
bay
one
of
the
grand
old
snowdon
strain
one
of
the
sort
that
could
race
and
stay
with
his
mighty
limbs
and
his
length
of
rein
born
and
bred
on
the
mountain
side
he
could
race
through
scrub
like
a
kangaroo
the
girl
herself
on
his
back
might
ride
and
the
swagman
would
carry
her
safely
through
he
would
travel
gaily
from
daylight
flush
till
after
the
stars
hung
out
their
lamps
there
was
never
his
like
in
the
open
bush
and
never
his
match
on
the
for
faster
horses
might
well
be
found
on
racing
tracks
or
a
plain
extent
but
few
if
any
on
broken
ground
could
see
the
way
that
the
swagman
went
when
this
girl
father
old
jim
carew
was
droving
out
on
the
castlereagh
with
conroy
cattle
a
wire
came
through
to
say
that
his
wife
could
live
the
day
and
he
was
a
hundred
miles
from
home
as
flies
the
crow
with
never
a
track
through
plains
as
pathless
as
ocean
foam
he
mounted
straight
on
the
swagman
back
he
left
the
camp
by
the
sundown
light
and
the
settlers
out
on
the
marthaguy
awoke
and
heard
in
the
dead
of
night
a
single
horseman
hurrying
by
he
crossed
the
bogan
at
dandaloo
and
many
a
mile
of
the
silent
plain
that
lonely
rider
behind
him
threw
before
they
settled
to
sleep
again
he
rode
all
night
and
he
steered
his
course
by
the
shining
stars
with
a
bushman
skill
and
every
time
that
he
pressed
his
horse
the
swagman
answered
him
gamely
still
he
neared
his
home
as
the
east
was
bright
the
doctor
met
him
outside
the
town
how
far
did
you
come
last
night
hundred
miles
since
the
sun
went
down
and
his
wife
got
round
and
an
oath
he
passed
so
long
as
he
or
one
of
his
breed
could
raise
a
coin
though
it
took
their
last
the
swagman
never
should
want
a
feed
and
kate
carew
when
her
father
died
she
kept
the
horse
and
she
kept
him
well
the
pride
of
the
district
far
and
wide
he
lived
in
style
at
the
bush
hotel
such
was
the
swagman
and
ryan
knew
nothing
about
could
pace
the
crack
little
he
care
for
the
man
in
blue
if
once
he
got
on
the
swagman
back
but
how
to
do
it
a
word
let
fall
gave
him
the
hint
as
the
girl
passed
by
nothing
but
to
the
stable
and
mind
your
eye
he
caught
her
meaning
and
quickly
turned
to
the
trooper
you
gain
a
stripe
by
arresting
me
and
it
easily
earned
let
go
to
the
stable
and
get
my
pipe
the
swagman
has
it
so
off
they
went
and
soon
as
ever
they
turned
their
backs
the
girl
slipped
down
on
some
errand
bent
behind
the
stable
and
seized
an
axe
the
trooper
stood
at
the
stable
door
while
ryan
went
in
quite
cool
and
slow
and
then
the
trick
had
been
played
before
the
girl
outside
gave
the
wall
a
blow
three
slabs
fell
out
of
the
stable
wall
was
done
ever
the
trooper
knew
and
ryan
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
fall
mounted
the
swagman
and
rushed
him
through
the
trooper
heard
the
ring
in
the
stable
yard
and
he
slammed
the
gate
but
the
swagman
rose
with
a
mighty
spring
at
the
fence
and
the
trooper
fired
too
late
as
they
raced
away
and
his
shots
flew
wide
and
ryan
no
longer
need
care
a
rap
for
never
a
horse
that
was
lapped
in
hide
could
catch
the
swagman
in
conroy
gap
and
that
the
story
you
want
to
know
if
ryan
came
back
to
his
kate
carew
of
course
he
should
have
as
stories
go
but
the
worst
of
it
is
this
story
true
and
in
real
life
it
a
certain
rule
whatever
poets
and
authors
say
of
robbers
and
all
their
school
these
horsethief
fellows
are
built
that
way
come
back
do
hope
it
the
slinking
hound
he
sloped
across
to
the
queensland
side
and
sold
the
swagman
for
fifty
pound
and
stole
the
money
and
more
beside
and
took
to
drink
and
by
some
good
chance
was
killed
thrown
out
of
a
stolen
trap
and
that
was
the
end
of
this
small
romance
the
end
of
the
story
of
conroy
gap
our
new
horse
the
boys
had
come
back
from
the
races
all
silent
and
down
on
their
luck
they
backed
straight
out
and
for
places
but
never
a
winner
they
struck
they
lost
their
good
money
on
slogan
and
fell
most
uncommonly
flat
when
partner
the
pride
of
the
bogan
was
beaten
by
aristocrat
and
one
said
move
that
instanter
we
sell
out
our
horses
and
quit
the
brutes
ought
to
win
in
a
canter
such
trials
they
do
when
they
fit
the
last
one
they
ran
was
a
snorter
a
gallop
to
gladden
one
heart
for
a
mile
and
a
quarter
and
finished
as
straight
as
a
dart
then
when
i
think
that
they
ready
to
win
me
a
nice
little
swag
they
are
licked
like
the
veriest
neddy
they
licked
from
the
fall
of
the
flag
the
mare
held
her
own
to
the
stable
she
died
out
to
nothing
at
that
and
partner
he
never
seemed
able
to
pace
it
with
aristocrat
times
have
been
bad
and
the
seasons
do
promise
to
be
of
the
best
in
short
boys
there
plenty
of
reasons
for
giving
the
racing
a
rest
the
mare
can
be
kept
on
the
station
her
breeding
is
good
as
can
be
but
partner
his
next
destination
is
rather
a
trouble
to
me
ca
sell
him
here
for
they
know
him
as
well
as
the
clerk
of
the
course
he
raced
and
won
races
till
blow
him
he
done
as
a
handicap
horse
a
jady
uncertain
performer
they
weight
him
right
out
of
the
hunt
and
clap
it
on
warmer
and
warmer
whenever
he
gets
near
the
front
no
use
to
paint
him
or
dot
him
or
put
any
on
his
brand
for
bushmen
are
smart
and
they
spot
him
in
any
in
the
land
the
folk
about
here
could
all
tell
him
could
swear
to
each
separate
hair
let
us
send
him
to
sydney
and
sell
him
there
plenty
of
jugginses
there
call
him
a
maiden
and
treat
to
trials
will
open
their
eyes
we
run
their
best
horses
and
beat
and
then
wo
they
think
him
a
prize
i
pity
the
fellow
that
buys
him
he
find
in
a
very
short
space
no
matter
how
highly
he
tries
him
the
beggar
wo
in
a
race
next
week
under
and
buyer
appeared
in
the
racehorse
for
sale
and
a
flyer
has
never
been
started
as
yet
a
trial
will
show
what
his
pace
is
the
buyer
can
get
him
in
light
and
win
all
the
handicap
races
apply
here
before
wednesday
night
he
sold
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
because
of
a
gallop
he
had
one
morning
with
bluefish
and
bertie
and
both
of
bad
and
when
the
old
horse
had
departed
the
life
on
the
station
grew
tame
the
was
dull
and
deserted
the
boys
had
gone
back
on
the
game
the
winter
rolled
by
and
the
station
was
green
with
the
garland
of
spring
a
spirit
of
glad
exultation
awoke
in
each
animate
thing
and
all
the
old
love
the
old
longing
broke
out
in
the
breasts
of
the
boys
the
visions
of
racing
came
thronging
with
all
its
delirious
joys
the
rushing
of
floods
in
their
courses
the
rattle
of
rain
on
the
roofs
recalled
the
fierce
rush
of
the
horses
the
thunder
of
galloping
hoofs
and
soon
one
broke
out
can
suffer
no
longer
the
life
of
a
slug
the
man
that
do
race
is
a
duffer
let
have
one
more
run
for
the
mug
races
no
matter
whatever
its
method
may
be
the
waterfowl
hold
a
regatta
the
run
heats
up
a
tree
the
emus
are
constantly
sprinting
a
handicap
out
on
the
plain
it
seems
like
all
nature
was
hinting
is
time
to
be
at
it
again
cockatoo
parrots
are
talking
of
races
to
far
away
lands
the
native
companions
are
walking
a
on
the
sands
the
little
foals
gallop
for
pastime
the
wallabies
race
down
the
gap
let
try
it
once
more
for
the
last
time
bring
out
the
old
jacket
and
cap
now
for
a
horse
we
might
try
one
of
those
that
are
bred
on
the
place
but
i
think
it
better
to
buy
one
a
horse
that
has
proved
he
can
race
let
us
send
down
to
sydney
to
skinner
a
thorough
good
judge
who
can
ride
and
ask
him
to
buy
us
a
spinner
to
clean
out
the
whole
countryside
they
wrote
him
a
letter
as
follows
want
you
to
buy
us
a
horse
he
must
have
the
speed
to
catch
swallows
and
stamina
with
it
of
course
the
price
ai
a
thing
that
grieve
us
it
getting
a
bad
annoys
the
undersigned
blokes
and
believe
us
we
yours
to
a
cinder
boys
he
answered
bought
you
a
hummer
a
horse
that
has
never
been
raced
i
saw
him
run
over
the
drummer
he
held
him
outclassed
and
outpaced
his
breeding
not
known
but
they
state
he
is
born
of
a
thoroughbred
strain
i
paid
them
a
hundred
and
eighty
and
started
the
horse
in
the
train
they
met
him
alas
that
these
verses
are
up
to
the
subject
demands
ca
set
forth
their
eloquent
curses
partner
was
back
on
their
they
went
in
to
meet
him
in
gladness
they
opened
his
box
with
delight
a
silent
procession
of
sadness
they
crept
to
the
station
at
night
and
life
has
grown
dull
on
the
station
the
boys
are
all
silent
and
slow
their
work
is
a
daily
vexation
and
sport
is
unknown
to
them
now
whenever
they
think
how
they
stranded
they
squeal
just
like
squeal
they
bit
their
own
hook
and
were
landed
with
fifty
pounds
loss
on
the
deal
an
idyll
of
dandaloo
on
western
plains
where
shade
is
not
summer
skies
of
cloudless
blue
where
all
is
dry
and
all
is
hot
there
stands
the
town
of
dandaloo
a
township
where
life
total
sum
is
sleep
diversified
with
rum
it
streets
with
dust
are
deep
vain
endeavour
to
express
the
dreamless
silence
of
its
sleep
its
wide
expansive
drunkenness
the
yearly
races
mostly
drew
a
lively
crowd
to
dandaloo
there
came
a
sportsman
from
the
east
the
eastern
land
where
sportsmen
blow
and
brought
with
him
a
speedy
beast
a
speedy
beast
as
horses
go
he
came
afar
in
hope
to
the
little
town
of
dandaloo
now
this
was
weak
of
him
i
wot
exceeding
weak
it
seemed
to
me
for
we
in
dandaloo
were
not
the
jugginses
we
seemed
to
be
in
fact
we
rather
thought
we
knew
our
book
by
heart
in
dandaloo
we
held
a
meeting
at
the
bar
and
met
the
question
fair
and
square
stumped
the
country
near
and
far
to
raise
the
cash
for
races
here
we
got
a
hundred
pounds
or
two
not
half
so
bad
for
dandaloo
now
it
seems
we
have
to
be
cleaned
out
by
this
here
sydney
bloke
with
his
imported
horse
and
he
will
scoop
the
pool
and
leave
us
broke
shall
we
sit
still
and
make
no
fuss
while
this
chap
climbs
all
over
us
the
races
came
to
dandaloo
and
all
the
cornstalks
from
the
west
on
kind
of
moke
and
screw
came
forth
in
all
their
glory
drest
the
stranger
horse
as
hard
as
nails
look
fit
to
run
for
new
south
wales
he
won
the
race
by
half
a
length
half
a
length
it
seemed
to
me
but
dandaloo
with
all
its
strength
roared
out
heat
most
fervently
and
after
hesitation
meet
the
judge
verdict
was
heat
and
many
men
there
were
could
tell
what
gave
the
verdict
extra
force
the
stewards
and
the
judge
as
well
they
all
had
backed
the
second
horse
for
things
like
this
they
sometimes
do
in
larger
towns
than
dandaloo
they
ran
it
off
the
stranger
won
hands
down
by
near
a
hundred
yards
he
smiled
to
think
his
troubles
done
but
dandaloo
held
all
the
cards
they
went
to
scale
and
cruel
fate
his
jockey
turned
out
perhaps
they
tampered
with
the
scale
i
can
not
tell
i
only
know
it
weighed
him
all
right
i
fail
to
paint
that
sydney
sportsman
woe
he
said
the
stewards
were
a
crew
of
thieves
in
dandaloo
he
lifted
up
his
voice
irate
and
swore
till
all
the
air
was
blue
so
then
we
rose
to
vindicate
the
dignity
of
dandaloo
here
said
we
must
not
poke
such
oaths
at
us
poor
country
folk
we
rode
him
softly
on
a
rail
we
shied
at
him
in
careless
glee
some
large
tomatoes
rank
and
stale
and
eggs
of
great
antiquity
their
wild
unholy
fragrance
flew
about
the
town
of
dandaloo
he
left
the
town
at
break
of
day
he
led
his
through
the
streets
and
now
he
tells
the
tale
they
say
to
every
racing
man
he
meets
and
sydney
sportsmen
all
eschew
the
atmosphere
of
dandaloo
the
geebung
polo
club
it
was
somewhere
up
the
country
in
a
land
of
rock
and
scrub
that
they
formed
an
institution
called
the
geebung
polo
club
they
were
long
and
wiry
natives
from
the
rugged
mountain
side
and
the
horse
was
never
saddled
that
the
geebungs
could
ride
but
their
style
of
playing
polo
was
irregular
and
rash
they
had
mighty
little
science
but
a
mighty
lot
of
dash
and
they
played
on
mountain
ponies
that
were
muscular
and
strong
though
their
coats
were
quite
unpolished
and
their
manes
and
tails
were
long
and
they
used
to
train
those
ponies
wheeling
cattle
in
the
scrub
they
were
demons
were
the
members
of
the
geebung
polo
club
it
was
somewhere
down
the
country
in
a
city
smoke
and
steam
that
a
polo
club
existed
called
cuff
and
collar
team
as
a
social
institution
was
a
marvellous
success
for
the
members
were
distinguished
by
exclusiveness
and
dress
they
had
natty
little
ponies
that
were
nice
and
smooth
and
sleek
for
their
cultivated
owners
only
rode
once
a
week
so
they
started
up
the
country
in
pursuit
of
sport
and
fame
for
they
meant
to
show
the
geebungs
how
they
ought
to
play
the
game
and
they
took
their
valets
with
them
just
to
give
their
boots
a
rub
ere
they
started
operations
on
the
geebung
polo
club
now
my
readers
can
imagine
how
the
contest
ebbed
and
flowed
when
the
geebung
boys
got
going
it
was
time
to
clear
the
road
and
the
game
was
so
terrific
that
ere
half
the
time
was
gone
a
spectator
leg
was
broken
just
from
merely
looking
on
for
they
waddied
one
another
till
the
plain
was
strewn
with
dead
while
the
score
was
kept
so
even
that
they
neither
got
ahead
and
the
cuff
and
collar
captain
when
he
tumbled
off
to
die
was
the
last
surviving
player
so
the
game
was
called
a
tie
then
the
captain
of
the
geebungs
raised
him
slowly
from
the
ground
though
his
wounds
were
mostly
mortal
yet
he
fiercely
gazed
around
there
was
no
one
to
oppose
him
all
the
rest
were
in
a
trance
so
he
scrambled
on
his
pony
for
his
last
expiring
chance
for
he
meant
to
make
an
effort
to
get
victory
to
his
side
so
he
struck
at
goal
and
missed
it
then
he
tumbled
off
and
died
by
the
old
campaspe
river
where
the
breezes
shake
the
grass
there
a
row
of
little
gravestones
that
the
stockmen
never
pass
for
they
bear
a
crude
inscription
saying
drop
a
tear
for
the
cuff
and
collar
players
and
the
geebung
boys
lie
here
and
on
misty
moonlit
evenings
while
the
dingoes
howl
around
you
can
see
their
shadows
flitting
down
that
phantom
polo
ground
you
can
hear
the
loud
collisions
as
the
flying
players
meet
and
the
rattle
of
the
mallets
and
the
rush
of
ponies
feet
till
the
terrified
spectator
rides
like
blazes
to
the
pub
he
been
haunted
by
the
spectres
of
the
geebung
polo
club
the
travelling
post
office
the
roving
breezes
come
and
go
the
reed
beds
sweep
and
sway
the
sleepy
river
murmurs
low
and
loiters
on
its
way
it
is
the
land
of
lots
o
time
along
the
castlereagh
the
old
man
son
had
left
the
farm
he
found
it
dull
and
slow
he
drifted
to
the
great
where
all
the
rovers
go
gone
so
long
the
old
man
said
dropped
right
out
of
mind
but
if
you
write
a
line
to
him
i
take
it
very
kind
he
shearing
here
and
fencing
there
a
kind
of
waif
and
stray
he
droving
now
with
conroy
sheep
along
the
castlereagh
sheep
are
travelling
for
the
grass
and
travelling
very
slow
they
may
be
at
mundooran
now
or
past
the
overflow
or
tramping
down
the
black
soil
flats
across
by
waddiwong
but
all
those
little
country
towns
would
send
the
letter
wrong
the
mailman
if
he
extra
tired
would
pass
them
in
his
sleep
it
safest
to
address
the
note
to
of
conroy
sheep
for
five
and
twenty
thousand
head
can
scarcely
go
astray
you
write
to
of
conroy
sheep
along
the
castlereagh
by
rock
and
ridge
and
riverside
the
western
mail
has
gone
across
the
great
blue
mountain
range
to
take
that
letter
on
a
moment
on
the
topmost
grade
while
open
fire
doors
glare
she
pauses
like
a
living
thing
to
breathe
the
mountain
air
then
launches
down
the
other
side
across
the
plains
away
to
bear
that
note
to
sheep
along
the
castlereagh
and
now
by
coach
and
mailman
bag
it
goes
from
town
to
town
and
conroy
gap
and
conroy
creek
have
marked
it
down
beneath
a
sky
of
deepest
blue
where
never
cloud
abides
a
speck
upon
the
waste
of
plain
the
lonely
mailman
rides
where
fierce
hot
winds
have
set
the
pine
and
myall
boughs
asweep
he
hails
the
shearers
passing
by
for
news
of
conroy
sheep
by
big
lagoons
where
wildfowl
play
and
crested
pigeons
flock
by
camp
fires
where
the
drovers
ride
around
their
restless
stock
and
past
the
teamster
toiling
down
to
fetch
the
wool
away
my
letter
chases
conroy
sheep
along
the
castlereagh
saltbush
bill
now
this
is
the
law
of
the
overland
that
all
in
the
west
obey
a
man
must
cover
with
travelling
sheep
a
stage
a
day
but
this
is
the
law
which
the
drovers
make
right
easily
understood
they
travel
their
stage
where
the
grass
is
bad
but
they
camp
where
the
grass
is
good
they
camp
and
they
ravage
the
squatter
grass
till
never
a
blade
remains
then
they
drift
away
as
the
white
clouds
drift
on
the
edge
of
the
saltbush
plains
from
camp
to
camp
and
from
run
to
run
they
battle
it
hand
to
hand
for
a
blade
of
grass
and
the
right
to
pass
on
the
track
of
the
overland
for
this
is
the
law
of
the
great
stock
routes
is
written
in
white
and
black
the
man
that
goes
with
a
travelling
mob
must
keep
to
a
track
and
the
drovers
keep
to
a
track
on
the
runs
where
the
grass
is
dead
but
they
spread
their
sheep
on
a
run
till
they
go
with
a
spread
so
the
squatters
hurry
the
drovers
on
from
dawn
till
the
fall
of
night
and
the
squatters
dogs
and
the
drovers
dogs
get
mixed
in
a
deadly
fight
yet
the
squatters
men
though
they
hunt
the
mob
are
willing
the
peace
to
keep
for
the
drovers
learn
how
to
use
their
hands
when
they
go
with
the
travelling
sheep
but
this
is
the
tale
of
a
jackaroo
that
came
from
a
foreign
strand
and
the
fight
that
he
fought
with
saltbush
bill
the
king
of
the
overland
now
saltbush
bill
was
a
drover
tough
as
ever
the
country
knew
he
had
fought
his
way
on
the
great
stock
routes
from
the
sea
to
the
big
barcoo
he
could
tell
when
he
came
to
a
friendly
run
that
gave
him
a
chance
to
spread
and
he
knew
where
the
hungry
owners
were
that
hurried
his
sheep
ahead
he
was
drifting
down
in
the
eighty
drought
with
a
mob
that
could
scarcely
creep
when
the
kangaroos
by
the
thousands
starve
it
is
rough
on
the
travelling
sheep
and
he
camped
one
night
at
the
on
the
edge
of
the
wilga
run
must
manage
a
feed
for
them
here
he
said
the
half
of
the
mob
are
done
so
he
spread
them
out
when
they
left
the
camp
wherever
they
liked
to
go
till
he
grew
aware
of
a
jackaroo
with
a
in
tow
and
they
set
to
work
on
the
straggling
sheep
and
with
many
a
stockwhip
crack
they
forced
them
in
where
the
grass
was
dead
in
the
space
of
the
track
so
william
prayed
that
the
hand
of
fate
might
suddenly
strike
him
blue
but
he
get
some
grass
for
his
starving
sheep
in
the
teeth
of
that
jackaroo
so
he
turned
and
he
cursed
the
jackaroo
he
cursed
him
alive
or
dead
from
the
soles
of
his
great
unwieldy
feet
to
the
crown
of
his
ugly
head
with
an
extra
curse
on
the
moke
he
rode
and
the
cur
at
his
heels
that
ran
till
the
jackaroo
from
his
horse
got
down
and
he
went
for
the
with
the
for
his
though
the
sheep
ran
loose
the
while
they
battled
it
out
on
the
saltbush
plain
in
the
regular
style
now
the
new
chum
fought
for
his
honour
sake
and
the
pride
of
the
english
race
but
the
drover
fought
for
his
daily
bread
with
a
smile
on
his
bearded
face
so
he
shifted
ground
and
he
sparred
for
wind
and
he
made
it
a
lengthy
mill
and
from
time
to
time
as
his
scouts
came
in
they
whispered
to
saltbush
bill
have
spread
the
sheep
with
a
spread
and
the
grass
it
is
something
grand
you
must
stick
to
him
bill
for
another
round
for
the
pride
of
the
overland
the
new
chum
made
it
a
rushing
fight
though
never
a
blow
got
home
till
the
sun
rode
high
in
the
cloudless
sky
and
glared
on
the
loam
till
the
sheep
drew
in
to
the
and
settled
them
down
to
rest
then
the
drover
said
he
would
fight
no
more
and
he
gave
his
opponent
best
so
the
new
chum
rode
to
the
homestead
straight
and
he
told
them
a
story
grand
of
the
desperate
fight
that
he
fought
that
day
with
the
king
of
the
overland
and
the
tale
went
home
to
the
public
schools
of
the
pluck
of
the
english
swell
how
the
drover
fought
for
his
very
life
but
blood
in
the
end
must
tell
but
the
travelling
sheep
and
the
wilga
sheep
were
boxed
on
the
old
man
plain
was
a
full
week
work
ere
they
drafted
out
and
hunted
them
off
again
with
a
week
good
grass
in
their
wretched
hides
with
a
curse
and
a
stockwhip
crack
they
hunted
them
off
on
the
road
once
more
to
starve
on
the
track
and
saltbush
bill
on
the
overland
will
many
a
time
recite
how
the
best
day
work
that
ever
he
did
was
the
day
that
he
lost
the
fight
a
mountain
station
i
bought
a
run
a
while
ago
on
country
rough
and
ridgy
where
wallaroos
and
wombats
grow
the
upper
murrumbidgee
the
grass
is
rather
scant
it
true
but
this
a
fair
exchange
is
the
sheep
can
see
a
lovely
view
by
climbing
up
the
ranges
and
flat
the
station
name
i
not
surprised
at
that
sirs
the
oaks
were
there
before
i
came
and
i
supplied
the
flat
sirs
a
man
would
wonder
how
it
done
the
stock
so
soon
decreases
they
sometimes
tumble
off
the
run
and
break
themselves
to
pieces
i
tried
to
make
expenses
meet
but
wasted
all
my
labours
the
sheep
the
dingoes
did
eat
were
stolen
by
the
neighbours
they
stole
my
pears
my
native
pears
those
felons
and
ravished
from
me
unawares
my
crop
of
and
sometimes
under
sunny
skies
without
an
explanation
the
murrumbidgee
used
to
rise
and
overflow
the
station
but
this
was
caused
as
now
i
know
when
summer
sunshine
glowing
had
melted
all
kiandra
snow
and
set
the
river
going
and
in
the
news
perhaps
you
read
passings
puckawidgee
fat
cattle
seven
hundred
head
swept
down
the
murrumbidgee
their
destination
quite
obscure
but
somehow
there
a
notion
unless
the
river
falls
they
sure
to
reach
the
southern
ocean
so
after
that
i
give
it
best
no
more
with
fate
i
battle
i
let
the
river
take
the
rest
for
those
were
all
my
cattle
and
with
one
comprehensive
curse
i
close
my
brief
narration
and
advertise
it
in
my
verse
sale
a
mountain
station
been
there
before
there
came
a
stranger
to
walgett
town
to
walgett
town
when
the
sun
was
low
and
he
carried
a
thirst
that
was
worth
a
crown
yet
how
to
quench
it
he
did
not
know
but
he
thought
he
might
take
those
yokels
down
the
guileless
yokels
of
walgett
town
they
made
him
a
bet
in
a
private
bar
in
a
private
bar
when
the
talk
was
high
and
they
bet
him
some
pounds
no
matter
how
far
he
could
pelt
a
stone
yet
he
could
not
shy
a
stone
right
over
the
river
so
brown
the
darling
river
at
walgett
town
he
knew
that
the
river
from
bank
to
bank
was
fifty
yards
and
he
smiled
a
smile
as
he
trundled
down
but
his
hopes
they
sank
for
there
was
a
stone
within
fifty
mile
for
the
saltbush
plain
and
the
open
down
produce
no
quarries
in
walgett
town
the
yokels
laughed
at
his
hopes
and
he
stood
awhile
like
a
man
in
a
dream
then
out
of
his
pocket
he
fetched
a
stone
and
pelted
it
over
the
silent
stream
he
had
been
there
before
he
had
wandered
down
on
a
previous
visit
to
walgett
town
the
man
who
was
away
the
widow
sought
the
lawyer
room
with
children
three
in
tow
she
told
the
lawyer
man
her
tale
in
tones
of
deepest
woe
said
she
husband
took
to
drink
for
pains
in
his
inside
and
never
drew
a
sober
breath
from
then
until
he
died
never
drew
a
sober
breath
he
died
without
a
will
and
i
must
sell
the
bit
of
land
the
childer
mouths
to
fill
there
some
is
grown
and
gone
away
but
some
is
childer
yet
and
times

very
bad
indeed

livin
hard

bit

the
widow

in
her
seat
do

lawyer

to
know
i
do
know
what
to
say
you
have
to
do
without
him
boss
for
peter
is
away
but
here
the
little
boy
spoke
up
said
he
thought
you
knew
he
done
six
months
in
goulburn
gaol
he
got
six
more
to
do
thus
in
one
comprehensive
flash
he
made
it
clear
as
day
the
mystery
of
peter
life
the
man
who
was
away
the
man
from
ironbark
it
was
the
man
from
ironbark
who
struck
the
sydney
town
he
wandered
over
street
and
park
he
wandered
up
and
down
he
loitered
here
he
loitered
there
till
he
was
like
to
drop
until
at
last
in
sheer
despair
he
sought
a
barber
shop
shave
my
beard
and
whiskers
off
i
be
a
man
of
mark
i
go
and
do
the
sydney
toff
up
home
in
ironbark
the
barber
man
was
small
and
flash
as
barbers
mostly
are
he
wore
a
sash
he
smoked
a
huge
cigar
he
was
a
humorist
of
note
and
keen
at
repartee
he
laid
the
odds
and
kept
a
whatever
that
may
be
and
when
he
saw
our
friend
arrive
he
whispered
a
lark
just
watch
me
catch
him
all
alive
this
man
from
ironbark
there
were
some
gilded
youths
that
sat
along
the
barber
wall
their
eyes
were
dull
their
heads
were
flat
they
had
no
brains
at
all
to
them
the
barber
passed
the
wink
his
dexter
eyelid
shut
make
this
bloomin
yokel
think
his
bloomin
throat
is
cut
and
as
he
soaped
and
rubbed
it
in
he
made
a
rude
remark
the
flats
is
pretty
green
up
there
in
ironbark
a
grunt
was
all
reply
he
got
he
shaved
the
bushman
chin
then
made
the
water
boiling
hot
and
dipped
the
razor
in
he
raised
his
hand
his
brow
grew
black
he
paused
awhile
to
gloat
then
slashed
the
across
his
victim
throat
upon
the
newly
shaven
skin
it
made
a
livid
mark
no
doubt
it
fairly
took
him
in
the
man
from
ironbark
he
fetched
a
wild
yell
might
wake
the
dead
to
hear
and
though
his
throat
he
knew
full
well
was
cut
from
ear
to
ear
he
struggled
gamely
to
his
feet
and
faced
the
foe
done
for
me
you
dog
i
beat
one
hit
before
i
go
i
only
wish
i
had
a
knife
you
blessed
murdering
shark
but
you
remember
all
your
life
the
man
from
ironbark
he
lifted
up
his
hairy
paw
with
one
tremendous
clout
he
landed
on
the
barber
jaw
and
knocked
the
barber
out
he
set
to
work
with
tooth
and
nail
he
made
the
place
a
wreck
he
grabbed
the
nearest
gilded
youth
and
tried
to
break
his
neck
and
all
the
while
his
throat
he
held
to
save
his
vital
spark
and
bloody
murder
yelled
the
man
from
ironbark
a
peeler
man
who
heard
the
din
came
in
to
see
the
show
he
tried
to
run
the
bushman
in
but
he
refused
to
go
and
when
at
last
the
barber
spoke
and
said
all
in
fun
was
just
a
little
harmless
joke
a
trifle
overdone
joke
he
cried
george
that
fine
a
lively
sort
of
lark
i
like
to
catch
that
murdering
swine
some
night
in
ironbark
and
now
while
round
the
shearing
floor
the
shearers
gape
he
tells
the
story
and
and
brags
of
his
escape
barber
chaps
what
keeps
a
tote
by
george
i
had
enough
one
tried
to
cut
my
bloomin
throat
but
thank
the
lord
it
tough
and
whether
he
believed
or
no
there
one
thing
to
remark
that
flowing
beards
are
all
the
go
way
up
in
ironbark
the
open
steeplechase
i
had
ridden
over
hurdles
up
the
country
once
or
twice
by
the
side
of
snowy
river
with
a
horse
they
called
ace
and
we
brought
him
down
to
sydney
and
our
rider
jimmy
rice
got
a
fall
and
broke
his
shoulder
so
they
nabbed
me
in
a
trice
me
that
never
wore
the
colours
for
the
open
steeplechase
the
running
said
the
trainer
your
only
chance
whatever
make
it
hot
from
start
to
finish
for
the
old
black
horse
can
stay
and
just
think
of
how
they
take
it
when
they
hear
on
snowy
river
that
the
country
boy
was
plucky
and
the
country
horse
was
clever
you
must
ride
for
old
monaro
and
the
mountain
boys
you
ready
said
the
starter
as
we
held
the
horses
back
all
ablazing
with
impatience
with
excitement
all
aglow
before
us
like
a
ribbon
stretched
the
steeplechasing
track
and
the
glistened
brightly
on
the
chestnut
and
the
black
as
the
starter
words
came
slowly
you
ready
go
well
i
scarcely
knew
we
started
i
was
with
wonder
till
the
field
closed
up
beside
me
and
a
jump
appeared
ahead
and
we
flew
it
like
a
hurdle
not
a
baulk
and
not
a
blunder
as
we
charged
it
all
together
and
it
fairly
whistled
under
and
then
some
were
pulled
behind
me
and
a
few
shot
out
and
led
so
we
ran
for
half
the
distance
and
i
making
no
pretences
when
i
tell
you
i
was
feeling
very
and
queer
for
those
jockeys
rode
like
demons
you
would
think
they
lost
their
senses
if
you
saw
them
rush
their
horses
at
those
rasping
five
foot
fences
and
in
place
of
making
running
i
was
falling
to
the
rear
till
a
chap
came
racing
past
me
on
a
horse
they
called
quiver
and
said
he
country
joker
are
you
going
to
give
it
best
are
you
frightened
of
the
fences
does
their
stoutness
make
you
shiver
have
they
come
to
breeding
cowards
by
the
side
of
snowy
river
are
there
riders
on
monaro
but
i
never
heard
the
rest
for
i
drove
the
ace
and
sent
him
just
as
fast
as
he
could
pace
it
at
the
big
black
line
of
timber
stretching
fair
across
the
track
and
he
shot
beside
the
quiver
said
i
boy
we
race
it
you
can
come
with
snowy
river
if
you
only
game
to
face
it
let
us
mend
the
pace
a
little
and
we
see
who
cries
a
crack
so
we
raced
away
together
and
we
left
the
others
standing
and
the
people
cheered
and
shouted
as
we
settled
down
to
ride
and
we
clung
beside
the
quiver
at
his
taking
off
and
landing
i
could
see
his
scarlet
nostril
and
his
mighty
ribs
expanding
and
the
ace
stretched
out
in
earnest
and
we
held
him
stride
for
stride
but
the
pace
was
so
terrific
that
they
soon
ran
out
their
tether
they
were
rolling
in
their
gallop
they
were
fairly
blown
and
beat
but
they
both
were
game
as
pebbles
neither
one
would
show
the
feather
and
we
rushed
them
at
the
fences
and
they
cleared
them
both
together
nearly
every
time
they
clouted
but
they
somehow
kept
their
feet
then
the
last
jump
rose
before
us
and
they
faced
it
game
as
ever
we
were
both
at
spur
and
whipcord
fetching
blood
at
every
bound
and
above
the
people
cheering
and
the
cries
of
and
i
could
hear
the
trainer
shouting
more
run
for
snowy
river
then
we
struck
the
jump
together
and
came
smashing
to
the
ground
well
the
quiver
ran
to
blazes
but
the
ace
stood
still
and
waited
stood
and
waited
like
a
statue
while
i
scrambled
on
his
back
there
was
no
one
next
or
near
me
for
the
field
was
fairly
slated
so
i
cantered
home
a
winner
with
my
shoulder
dislocated
while
the
man
that
rode
the
quiver
followed
limping
down
the
track
and
he
shook
my
hand
and
told
me
that
in
all
his
days
he
never
met
a
man
who
rode
more
gamely
and
our
last
set
to
was
prime
and
we
wired
them
on
monaro
how
we
chanced
to
beat
the
quiver
and
they
sent
us
back
an
answer
old
sort
from
snowy
river
send
us
word
each
race
you
start
in
and
we
back
you
every
time
the
amateur
rider
going
to
ride
for
us
with
the
pants
and
the
eyeglass
and
all
amateur
do
he
just
look
it
it
twenty
to
one
on
a
fall
boss
must
be
gone
off
his
head
to
be
sending
our
steeplechase
crack
out
over
fences
like
these
with
an
object
like
that
on
his
back
ride
do
tell
he
can
ride
with
his
pants
just
as
loose
as
balloons
how
can
he
sit
on
his
horse
and
his
spurs
like
a
pair
of
harpoons
ought
to
be
under
the
dog
act
he
ought
and
be
kept
off
the
course
fall
why
he
fall
off
a
cart
let
alone
off
a
steeplechase
horse
yessir
the
is
all
ready
i
wish
you
have
rode
him
before
nothing
like
knowing
your
sir
and
this
chap
a
terror
to
bore
battleaxe
always
could
pull
and
he
rushes
his
fences
like
fun
stands
off
his
jump
twenty
feet
and
then
springs
like
a
shot
from
a
gun
oh
he
can
jump
all
right
sir
you
make
no
mistake
a
toff
clouts
in
earnest
too
sometimes
you
mind
that
he
do
clout
you
off
do
seem
to
mind
how
he
hits
his
shins
is
as
hard
as
a
nail
sometimes
you
see
the
fence
shake
and
the
splinters
fly
up
from
the
rail
all
you
can
do
is
to
hold
him
and
just
let
him
jump
as
he
likes
give
him
his
head
at
the
fences
and
hang
on
like
death
if
he
strikes
do
let
him
run
himself
out
you
can
lie
third
or
fourth
in
the
race
until
you
clear
the
stone
wall
and
from
that
you
can
put
on
the
pace
fell
at
that
wall
once
he
did
and
it
gave
him
a
regular
spread
ever
since
that
time
he
flies
it
he
stop
if
you
pull
at
his
head
just
let
him
race
you
can
trust
him
he
take
care
he
do
fall
and
i
think
that
the
lot
but
remember
must
have
his
head
at
the
well
he
down
safe
as
far
as
the
start
and
he
seems
to
sit
on
pretty
neat
only
his
baggified
breeches
would
ruinate
anyone
seat
they
away
here
they
come
the
first
fence
and
he
head
over
heels
for
a
crown
good
for
the
new
chum

of
the
others
are
down

the
treble

after

and
thank
you
and
them
was
the
words
that
i
said
on
kiley
run
the
roving
breezes
come
and
go
on
kiley
run
the
sleepy
river
murmurs
low
and
far
away
one
dimly
sees
beyond
the
stretch
of
forest
trees
beyond
the
foothills
dusk
and
dun
the
ranges
sleeping
in
the
sun
on
kiley
run
is
many
years
since
first
i
came
to
kiley
run
more
years
than
i
would
care
to
name
since
i
a
stripling
used
to
ride
for
miles
and
miles
at
kiley
side
the
while
in
stirring
tones
he
told
the
stories
of
the
days
of
old
on
kiley
run
i
see
the
old
bush
homestead
now
on
kiley
run
just
nestled
down
beneath
the
brow
of
one
small
ridge
above
the
sweep
of
where
willows
weep
and
jasmine
flowers
and
roses
bloom
the
air
was
laden
with
perfume
on
kiley
run
we
lived
the
good
old
station
life
on
kiley
run
with
little
thought
of
care
or
strife
old
kiley
seldom
used
to
roam
he
liked
to
make
the
run
his
home
the
swagman
never
turned
away
with
empty
hand
at
close
of
day
from
kiley
run
we
kept
a
racehorse
now
and
then
on
kiley
run
and
stations
brought
their
men
to
meetings
where
the
sport
was
free
and
dainty
ladies
came
to
see
their
champions
ride
with
laugh
and
song
the
old
house
rang
the
whole
night
long
on
kiley
run
the
station
hands
were
friends
i
wot
on
kiley
run
a
reckless
lot
all
splendid
riders
and
they
knew
the
was
kindness
through
and
through
old
kiley
always
stood
their
friend
and
so
they
served
him
to
the
end
on
kiley
run
but
droughts
and
losses
came
apace
to
kiley
run
till
ruin
stared
him
in
the
face
he
toiled
and
toiled
while
lived
the
light
he
dreamed
of
overdrafts
at
night
at
length
because
he
could
not
pay
his
bankers
took
the
stock
away
from
kiley
run
old
kiley
stood
and
saw
them
go
from
kiley
run
the
cattle
marching
slow
his
stockmen
mates
for
many
a
day
they
wrung
his
hand
and
went
away
too
old
to
make
another
start
old
kiley
died
of
broken
heart
on
kiley
run
the
owner
lives
in
england
now
of
kiley
run
he
knows
a
racehorse
from
a
cow
but
that
is
all
he
knows
of
stock
his
chiefest
care
is
how
to
dock
expenses
and
he
sends
from
town
to
cut
the
shearers
wages
down
on
kiley
run
there
are
no
neighbours
anywhere
near
kiley
run
the
hospitable
homes
are
bare
the
gardens
gone
for
no
pretence
must
hinder
cutting
down
expense
the
homestead
that
we
held
so
dear
contains
a
overseer
on
kiley
run
all
life
and
sport
and
hope
have
died
on
kiley
run
no
longer
there
the
stockmen
ride
for
boundary
riders
creep
on
mongrel
horses
after
sheep
through
ranges
where
at
racing
speed
old
kiley
used
to
the
on

there
runs
a

for
thirty
miles
through

wretched
sheep
must
pass
without

you

what
fate
will
bring
to

the

it

at

and
there
rose
the
sound
thro
the
livelong
day
of
the
constant
clash
that
the
make
when
the
fastest
shearers
are
making
play
but
there
was
a
man
in
the
shearers
lines
that
could
shear
a
sheep
with
the
two
devines
they
had
rung
the
sheds
of
the
east
and
west
had
beaten
the
cracks
of
the
walgett
side
and
the
cooma
shearers
had
them
best
when
they
saw
them
shear
they
were
satisfied
from
the
southern
slopes
to
the
western
pines
they
were
noted
men
were
the
two
devines
was
a
wether
flock
that
had
come
to
hand
great
struggling
brutes
that
the
shearers
shirk
for
the
fleece
was
filled
with
the
grass
and
sand
and
seventy
sheep
was
a
big
day
work
a
pound
a
hundred
it
dashed
hard
lines
to
shear
such
sheep
said
the
two
devines
but
the
shearers
knew
that
they
make
a
cheque
when
they
came
to
deal
with
the
station
ewes
they
were
bare
of
belly
and
bare
of
neck
with
a
fleece
as
light
as
a
kangaroo
will
show
the
boss
how
a
shines
when
we
reach
those
ewes
said
the
two
devines
but
it
chanced
next
day
when
the
stunted
pines
were
swayed
and
stirred
with
the
breath
that
a
message
came
for
the
two
devines
that
their
father
lay
at
the
point
of
death
so
away
at
speed
through
the
whispering
pines
down
the
bridle
track
rode
the
two
devines
it
was
fifty
miles
to
their
father
hut
and
the
dawn
was
bright
when
they
rode
away
at
the
fall
of
night
when
the
shed
was
shut
and
the
men
had
rest
from
the
toilsome
day
to
the
shed
once
more
through
the
pines
on
their
weary
steeds
came
the
two
devines
you
back
right
sudden
the
super
said
the
old
man
dead
and
the
funeral
done
no
sir
he
ai
not
exactly
dead
but
as
good
as
dead
said
the
eldest
son
we
could
bear
such
a
chance
to
lose
so
we
came
straight
back
to
tackle
the
ewes
they
are
shearing
ewes
at
the
myall
lake
and
the
shed
is
merry
the
livelong
day
with
the
clashing
sound
that
the
make
when
the
fastest
shearers
are
making
play
and
a
couple
of
and
are
the
tallies
made
by
the
two
devines
in
the
droving
days
a
pound
said
the
auctioneer
a
pound
and
i
standing
here
selling
this
animal
gain
or
loss
only
a
pound
for
the
drover
horse
one
of
the
sort
that
was
never
afraid
one
of
the
boys
of
the
old
brigade
thoroughly
honest
and
game
i
swear
only
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
plenty
as
bad
to
be
seen
in
town
give
me
a
bid
and
i
knock
him
down
sold
as
he
stands
and
without
recourse
give
me
a
bid
for
the
drover
horse
loitering
there
in
an
aimless
way
somehow
i
noticed
the
poor
old
grey
weary
and
battered
and
screwed
of
course
yet
when
i
noticed
the
old
grey
horse
the
rough
bush
saddle
and
single
rein
of
the
bridle
laid
on
his
tangled
mane
straightway
the
crowd
and
the
auctioneer
seemed
on
a
sudden
to
disappear
melted
away
in
a
kind
of
haze
for
my
heart
went
back
to
the
droving
days
back
to
the
road
and
i
crossed
again
over
the
miles
of
the
saltbush
plain
the
shining
plain
that
is
said
to
be
the
bed
of
an
inland
sea
where
the
air
so
dry
and
so
clear
and
bright
refracts
the
sun
with
a
wondrous
light
and
out
in
the
dim
horizon
makes
the
deep
blue
gleam
of
the
phantom
lakes
at
dawn
of
day
we
would
feel
the
breeze
that
stirred
the
boughs
of
the
sleeping
trees
and
brought
a
breath
of
the
fragrance
rare
that
comes
and
goes
in
that
scented
air
for
the
trees
and
grass
and
the
shrubs
contain
a
dry
sweet
scent
on
the
saltbush
plain
for
those
that
love
it
and
understand
the
saltbush
plain
is
a
wonderland
a
wondrous
country
where
nature
ways
were
revealed
to
me
in
the
droving
days
we
saw
the
fleet
wild
horses
pass
and
the
kangaroos
through
the
mitchell
grass
the
emu
ran
with
her
frightened
brood
all
unmolested
and
unpursued
but
there
rose
a
shout
and
a
wild
hubbub
when
the
dingo
raced
for
his
native
scrub
and
he
paid
right
dear
for
his
stolen
meals
with
the
drover
dogs
at
his
wretched
heels
for
we
ran
him
down
at
a
rattling
pace
while
the
packhorse
joined
in
the
stirring
chase
and
a
wild
halloo
at
the
kill
we
raise
we
were
light
of
heart
in
the
droving
days
was
a
drover
horse
and
my
hand
again
made
a
move
to
close
on
a
fancied
rein
for
i
felt
the
swing
and
the
easy
stride
of
the
grand
old
horse
that
i
used
to
ride
in
drought
or
plenty
in
good
or
ill
that
same
old
steed
was
my
comrade
still
the
old
grey
horse
with
his
honest
ways
was
a
mate
to
me
in
the
droving
days
when
we
kept
our
watch
in
the
cold
and
damp
if
the
cattle
broke
from
the
sleeping
camp
over
the
flats
and
across
the
plain
with
my
head
bent
down
on
his
waving
mane
through
the
boughs
above
and
the
stumps
below
on
the
darkest
night
i
could
let
him
go
at
a
racing
speed
he
would
choose
his
course
and
my
life
was
safe
with
the
old
grey
horse
but
man
and
horse
had
a
favourite
job
when
an
outlaw
broke
from
a
station
mob
with
a
right
good
will
was
the
stockwhip
plied
as
the
old
horse
raced
at
the
straggler
side
and
the
greenhide
whip
such
a
weal
would
raise
we
could
use
the
whip
in
the
droving
days
a
pound
and
was
this
the
end
only
a
pound
for
the
drover
friend
the
drover
friend
that
had
seen
his
day
and
now
was
worthless
and
cast
away
with
a
broken
knee
and
a
broken
heart
to
be
flogged
and
starved
in
a
hawker
cart
well
i
made
a
bid
for
a
sense
of
shame
and
the
memories
dear
of
the
good
old
game
you
guinea
and
cheap
at
that
against
you
there
in
the
curly
hat
only
a
guinea
and
one
more
chance
down
he
goes
if
there
no
advance
third
and
the
last
time
one
two
three
and
the
old
grey
horse
was
knocked
down
to
me
and
now
he
wandering
fat
and
sleek
on
the
lucerne
flats
by
the
homestead
creek
i
dare
not
ride
him
for
fear
he
fall
but
he
does
a
journey
to
beat
them
all
for
though
he
scarcely
a
trot
can
raise
he
can
take
me
back
to
the
droving
days
lost
ought
to
be
home
said
the
old
man
there
something
amiss
he
only
went
to
the
he
ought
to
be
back
by
this
he
ride
the
reckless
filly
he
have
his
wilful
way
and
here
he
not
back
at
sundown
and
what
will
his
mother
say
was
always
his
mother
idol
since
ever
his
father
died
and
there
is
a
horse
on
the
station
that
he
is
game
to
ride
but
that
reckless
mare
is
vicious
and
if
once
she
gets
away
he
has
got
strength
to
hold
her
and
what
will
his
mother
say
the
old
man
walked
to
the
sliprail
and
peered
up
the
track
and
looked
and
longed
for
the
rider
that
would
never
more
come
back
and
the
mother
came
and
clutched
him
with
sudden
spasmodic
fright
has
become
of
my
willie
why
is
he
home
away
in
the
gloomy
ranges
at
the
foot
of
an
ironbark
the
bonnie
winsome
laddie
was
lying
stiff
and
stark
for
the
reckless
mare
had
smashed
him
against
a
leaning
limb
and
his
comely
face
was
battered
and
his
merry
eyes
were
dim
and
the
thoroughbred
chestnut
filly
the
saddle
beneath
her
flanks
was
away
like
fire
through
the
ranges
to
join
the
wild
mob
ranks
and
a
woman
and
an
old
man
worn
and
grey
were
searching
all
night
in
the
ranges
till
the
sunrise
brought
the
day
and
the
mother
kept
feebly
calling
with
a
hope
that
would
not
die
where
are
you
willie
but
how
can
the
dead
reply
and
hope
died
out
with
the
daylight
and
the
darkness
brought
despair
god
pity
the
stricken
mother
and
answer
the
widow
prayer
though
far
and
wide
they
sought
him
they
found
not
where
he
fell
for
the
ranges
held
him
precious
and
guarded
their
treasure
well
the
wattle
blooms
above
him
and
the
blue
bells
blow
close
by
and
the
brown
bees
buzz
the
secret
and
the
wild
birds
sing
reply
but
the
mother
pined
and
faded
and
cried
and
took
no
rest
and
rode
each
day
to
the
ranges
on
her
hopeless
weary
quest
seeking
her
loved
one
ever
she
faded
and
pined
away
but
with
strength
of
her
great
affection
she
still
sought
every
day
know
that
sooner
or
later
i
shall
find
my
boy
she
said
but
she
came
not
home
one
evening
and
they
found
her
lying
dead
and
stamped
on
the
poor
pale
features
as
the
spirit
homeward
pass
was
an
angel
smile
of
gladness
she
had
found
the
boy
at
last
over
the
range
little
bush
maiden
playing
alone
in
the
dry
in
the
small
green
flat
on

high
tell
us
the
tale
of
your
lonely
life

i
live

granny
in
yon
wee
place

your
father
and
mother
we
said
she
puzzled
awhile
with
thoughtful
face
then
a
light
came
into
the
shy
brown
eye
and
she
smiled
for
she
thought
the
question
strange
on
a
thing
so
certain
people
die
they
go
to
the
country
over
the
range
what
is
this
country
like

never
need
work
nor
want
nor
weep
no
troubles

their
hearts
to
estrange

asleep

but
we
know
that
god

this
gift
in

that
when
we

to
the
final

over

how
went
missing
let
us
cease
our
idle
chatter
let
the
tears
bedew
our
cheek
for
a
man
from
tallangatta
has
been
missing
for
a
week
where
the
roaring
flooded
murray
covered
all
the
lower
land
there
he
started
in
a
hurry
with
a
bottle
in
his
hand
and
his
fate
is
hid
for
ever
but
the
public
seem
to
think
that
he
slumbered
by
the
river
the
influence
of
drink
and
they
scarcely
seem
to
wonder
that
the
river
wide
and
deep
never
woke
him
with
its
thunder
never
stirred
him
in
his
sleep
as
the
crashing
logs
came
sweeping
and
their
tumult
filled
the
air
then
murmured
sleeping
a
wake
in
ould
kildare
so
the
river
rose
and
found
him
sleeping
softly
by
the
stream
and
the
cruel
waters
drowned
him
ere
he
wakened
from
his
dream
and
the
wattle
blooming
brightly
on
the
lea
saw
and
the
bottle
going
drifting
out
to
sea
a
voice
from
the
town
a
sequel
to
mowbray
morris
voice
from
the
i
thought
in
the
days
of
the
droving
of
steps
i
might
hope
to
retrace
to
be
done
with
the
bush
and
the
roving
and
settle
once
more
in
my
place
with
a
heart
that
was
well
nigh
to
breaking
in
the
long
lonely
rides
on
the
plain
i
thought
of
the
pleasure
of
taking
the
hand
of
a
lady
again
i
am
back
into
civilisation
once
more
in
the
stir
and
the
strife
but
the
old
joys
have
lost
their
sensation
the
light
has
gone
out
of
my
life
the
men
of
my
time
they
have
married
made
fortunes
or
gone
to
the
wall
too
long
from
the
scene
i
have
tarried
and
somehow
i
out
of
it
all
for
i
go
to
the
balls
and
the
races
a
lonely
companionless
elf
and
the
ladies
bestow
all
their
graces
on
others
less
grey
than
myself
while
the
talk
goes
around
i
a
dumb
one
youngsters
that
chatter
and
prate
and
they
call
me
man
who
was
someone
way
back
in
the
year
and
i
look
sour
and
old
at
the
dancers
that
swing
to
the
strains
of
the
band
and
the
ladies
all
give
me
the
lancers
no
waltzes
i
quite
understand
for
matrons
intent
upon
matching
their
daughters
with
infinite
push
would
scarce
think
him
worthy
the
catching
the
man
from
the
bush
new
partners
have
come
and
new
faces
and
i
of
the
bygone
brigade
sharply
feel
that
oblivion
my
place
is
i
must
lie
with
the
rest
in
the
shade
and
the
youngsters
and
pleasant
they
live
as
we
lived
fairly
fast
but
i
doubt
if
the
men
of
the
present
are
as
good
as
the
men
of
the
past
of
excitement
and
praise
they
are
chary
there
is
nothing
much
good
upon
earth
their
watchword
is
they
are
bored
from
the
days
of
their
birth
where
the
life
that
we
led
was
a
revel
they
and
relent
and
refrain
i
could
show
them
the
road
to
the
devil
were
i
only
a
youngster
again
i
could
show
them
the
road
where
the
stumps
are
the
pleasures
that
end
in
remorse
and
the
game
where
the
devil
three
trumps
are
the
woman
the
card
and
the
horse
shall
the
blind
lead
the
blind
shall
the
sower
of
wind
reap
the
storm
as
of
yore
though
they
get
to
their
goal
somewhat
slower
they
march
where
we
hurried
before
for
the
world
never
learns
just
as
we
did
they
gallantly
go
to
their
fate
unheeded
all
warnings
unheeded
the
maxims
of
elders
sedate
as
the
husbandman
patiently
toiling
draws
a
harvest
each
year
from
the
soil
so
the
fools
grow
afresh
for
the
spoiling
and
a
new
crop
of
thieves
for
the
spoil
but
a
truce
to
this
dull
moralising
let
them
drink
while
the
drops
are
of
gold
i
have
tasted
the
dregs
surprising
were
the
new
wine
to
me
like
the
old
and
i
weary
for
lack
of
employment
in
idleness
day
after
day
for
the
key
to
the
door
of
enjoyment
is
youth
and
i
thrown
it
away
a
bunch
of
roses
roses
ruddy
and
roses
white
what
are
the
joys
that
my
heart
discloses
sitting
alone
in
the
fading
light
memories
come
to
me
here
with
the
wonderful
scent
of
the
big
red
roses
memories
come
as
the
daylight
fades
down
on
the
hearth
where
the
firelight
dozes
flicker
and
flutter
the
lights
and
shades
and
i
see
the
face
of
a
queen
of
maids
whose
memory
comes
with
the
scent
of
roses
visions
arise
of
a
scene
of
mirth
and
a
belle
that
superbly
poses
a
queenly
woman
of
queenly
worth
and
i
am
the
happiest
man
on
earth
with
a
single
flower
from
a
bunch
of
roses
only
her
memory
lives
god
in
his
wisdom
her
young
life
closes
over
her
grave
may
the
turf
be
light
cover
her
coffin
with
roses
white
she
was
always
fond
of
the
big
white
roses
such
are
the
visions
that
fade
away
man
proposes
and
god
disposes
look
in
the
glass
and
i
see
only
an
old
man
worn
and
grey
bending
his
head
to
a
bunch
of
roses
black
swans
as
i
lie
at
rest
on
a
patch
of
clover
in
the
western
park
when
the
day
is
done
i
watch
as
the
wild
black
swans
fly
over
with
their
phalanx
turned
to
the
sinking
sun
and
i
hear
the
clang
of
their
leader
crying
to
a
lagging
mate
in
the
rearward
flying
and
they
fade
away
in
the
darkness
dying
where
the
stars
are
mustering
one
by
one
oh
ye
wild
black
swans
a
world
of
wonder
for
a
while
to
join
in
your
westward
flight
with
the
stars
above
and
the
dim
earth
under
through
the
cooling
air
of
the
glorious
night
as
we
swept
along
on
our
pinions
winging
we
should
catch
the
chime
of
a
ringing
or
the
distant
note
of
a
torrent
singing
or
the
flash
of
a
station
light
from
the
northern
lakes
with
the
reeds
and
rushes
where
the
hills
are
clothed
with
a
purple
haze
where
the
chime
and
the
songs
of
thrushes
make
music
sweet
in
the
jungle
maze
they
will
hold
their
course
to
the
westward
ever
till
they
reach
the
banks
of
the
old
grey
river
where
the
waters
wash
and
the
quiver
in
the
burning
heat
of
the
summer
days
oh
ye
strange
wild
birds
will
ye
bear
a
greeting
to
the
folk
that
live
in
that
western
land
then
for
every
sweep
of
your
pinions
beating
ye
shall
bear
a
wish
to
the
sunburnt
band
to
the
stalwart
men
who
are
stoutly
fighting
with
the
heat
and
drought
and
the
smiting
yet
whose
life
somehow
has
a
strange
inviting
when
once
to
the
work
they
have
put
their
hand
facing
it
yet
oh
my
friend
what
does
it
matter
for
rain
or
shine
for
the
hopes
deferred
and
the
gain
departed
nothing
could
conquer
that
heart
of
thine
and
thy
health
and
strength
are
beyond
confessing
as
the
only
joys
that
are
worth
possessing
may
the
days
to
come
be
as
rich
in
blessing
as
the
days
we
spent
in
the
auld
lang
syne
i
would
fain
go
back
to
the
old
grey
river
to
the
old
bush
days
when
our
hearts
were
light
but
alas
those
days
they
have
fled
for
ever
they
are
like
the
swans
that
have
swept
from
sight
and
i
know
full
well
that
the
strangers
faces
would
meet
us
now
in
our
dearest
places
for
our
day
is
dead
and
has
left
no
traces
but
the
thoughts
that
live
in
my
mind
there
are
folk
long
dead
and
our
hearts
would
sicken
we
would
grieve
for
them
with
a
bitter
pain
if
the
past
could
live
and
the
dead
could
quicken
we
then
might
turn
to
that
life
again
but
on
lonely
nights
we
would
hear
them
calling
we
should
hear
their
steps
on
the
pathways
falling
we
should
loathe
the
life
with
a
hate
appalling
in
our
lonely
rides
by
the
ridge
and
plain
in
the
silent
park
is
a
scent
of
clover
and
the
distant
roar
of
the
town
is
dead
and
i
hear
once
more
as
the
swans
fly
over
their
clamour
from
overhead
they
are
flying
west
by
their
instinct
guided
and
for
man
likewise
is
his
fate
decided
and
griefs
apportioned
and
joys
divided
by
a
mighty
power
with
a
purpose
dread
the
all
right
he
came
from
out
that
land
of
heat
and
drought
and
dust
and
gravel
he
got
a
touch
of
sun
and
rested
at
the
run
until
his
cure
was
done
and
he
could
travel
when
spring
had
decked
the
plain
he
flitted
off
again
as
flit
the
swallows
and
from
that
western
land
when
many
months
were
spanned
a
letter
came
to
hand
which
read
as
follows
sir
i
take
my
pen
in
hopes
that
all
your
men
and
you
are
hearty
you
think
that
i
forgot
your
kindness
scott
oh
no
dear
sir
i
not
that
sort
of
party
sometimes
bet
i
know
well
now
you
have
a
show
the
to
frighten
up
here
at
wingadee
young
billy
fife
and
me
we
training
strife
and
he
is
a
all
right
now
we
running
byes
but
sir
first
time
he
tries
i
send
you
word
of
and
running
the
their
measures
we
have
took
it
is
the
deadest
hook
you
ever
heard
of
when
we
lets
him
go
why
then
i
let
you
know
and
you
can
have
a
show
to
put
a
mite
on
now
sir
my
leave
i
take
yours
truly
william
blake
make
no
mistake
a
all
right
by
next
week
i
saw
my
friend
had
been
a
bit
too
cunning
i
read
racehorse
strife
and
jockey
william
fife
disqualified
for
life
suspicious
running
but
though
they
spoilt
his
game
i
reckon
all
the
same
i
fairly
ought
to
claim
my
friend
a
white
for
though
he
was
straight
his
deeds
would
indicate
his
heart
at
any
rate
was
all
right
the
boss
of
the
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
chili
i
was
readin
the
other
day
of
president
balmaceda
and
of
how
he
was
sent
away
it
seems
that
he
did
suit
they
thought
that
they
like
a
change
so
they
started
an
insurrection
and
chased
him
across
the
range
they
seemed
to
be
restless
people
and
judging
by
what
you
hear
they
raise
up
these
revolutions
two
or
three
times
a
year
and
the
man
that
goes
out
of
office
he
goes
for
the
boundary
for
there
is
no
vote
by
ballot
it
bullets
that
does
the
trick
and
it
ai
like
a
real
battle
where
the
prisoners
lives
are
spared
and
they
fight
till
there
one
side
beaten
and
then
there
a
truce
declared
and
the
man
that
has
got
the
licking
goes
down
like
a
blooming
lord
to
hand
in
his
resignation
and
give
up
his
blooming
sword
and
the
other
man
bows
and
takes
it
and
everything
all
polite
this
was
that
kind
of
a
picnic
this
was
that
sort
of
a
fight
for
the
they
took
they
shot
no
odds
were
they
small
or
great
if
they
collared
old
balmaceda
they
reckoned
to
shoot
him
straight
a
lot
of
bloodthirsty
devils
they
were
but
there
ai
a
doubt
they
must
have
been
real
plucked
the
way
that
they
fought
it
out
and
the
king
of
all
i
reckon
the
man
that
could
stand
a
pinch
was
the
boss
of
a
gunboat
they
called
her
the
lynch
well
he
was
for
balmaceda
and
after
the
war
was
done
and
balmaceda
was
beaten
and
his
troops
had
been
forced
to
run
the
other
man
fetched
his
army
and
proceeded
to
do
things
brown
he
marched
into
the
fortress
and
took
command
of
the
town
cannon
and
guns
and
horses
troopin
along
the
road
rumblin
over
the
bridges
and
never
a
foeman
showed
till
they
came
in
sight
of
the
harbour
and
the
very
first
thing
they
see
was
this
mite
of
a
gunboat
against
the
quay
and
there
as
they
watched
they
noticed
a
flutter
of
crimson
rag
and
under
their
eyes
he
hoisted
old
balmaceda
flag
well
i
tell
you
it
fairly
knocked
it
just
took
away
their
breath
for
he
must
ha
known
if
they
caught
him
was
nothin
but
sudden
death
an
he
got
no
fire
in
his
furnace
no
chance
to
put
out
to
sea
so
he
stood
by
his
gun
and
waited
with
his
vessel
against
the
quay
well
they
sent
him
a
civil
message
to
say
that
the
war
was
done
and
most
of
his
side
were
corpses
and
all
that
were
left
had
run
and
blood
had
been
spilt
sufficient
so
they
gave
him
a
chance
to
decide
if
he
haul
down
his
bit
of
bunting
and
come
on
the
winning
side
he
listened
and
heard
their
message
and
answered
them
all
polite
that
he
was
a
spanish
hidalgo
and
the
men
of
his
race
fight
a
gunboat
against
an
army
and
with
never
a
chance
to
run
and
them
with
their
hundred
cannon
and
him
with
a
single
gun
the
odds
were
a
trifle
heavy
but
he
was
the
sort
to
flinch
so
he
opened
fire
on
the
army
did
the
boss
of
the
lynch
they
pounded
his
boat
to
pieces
they
silenced
his
single
gun
and
captured
the
whole
consignment
for
none
of
cared
to
run
and
it
do
say
whether
they
shot
him
it
do
even
give
his
name
but
whatever
they
did
i
wager
that
he
went
to
his
graveyard
game
i
tell
you
those
old
hidalgos
so
stately
and
so
polite
they
turn
out
the
real
maginnis
when
it
comes
to
an
uphill
fight
there
was
general
alcantara
who
died
in
the
heaviest
brunt
and
general
alzereca
was
killed
in
the
battle
front
but
the
king
of
all
i
reckon
the
man
that
could
stand
a
pinch
was
the
man
who
attacked
the
army
with
the
gunboat
lynch
a
bushman
song
i
travellin
down
the
castlereagh
and
i
a
station
hand
i
handy
with
the
ropin
pole
i
handy
with
the
brand
and
i
can
ride
a
rowdy
colt
or
swing
the
axe
all
day
but
there
no
demand
for
a
along
the
castlereagh
so
it
shift
boys
shift
for
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
that
we
got
to
make
a
shift
to
the
stations
further
out
with
the
runnin
after
for
he
follows
like
a
dog
we
must
strike
across
the
country
at
the
old
this
old
black
horse
i
riding
if
you
notice
what
his
brand
he
wears
the
crooked
r
you
see
none
better
in
the
land
he
takes
a
lot
of
beatin
and
the
other
day
we
tried
for
a
bit
of
a
joke
with
a
racing
bloke
for
twenty
pounds
a
side
it
was
shift
boys
shift
for
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
that
i
had
to
make
him
shift
for
the
money
was
nearly

but
he
cantered

other

marthaguy

scab
says
i
looked
along
the
shearin
floor
before
i
turned
to
go
there
were
eight
or
ten
dashed
chinamen
in
a
row
it
was
shift
boys
shift
for
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
it
was
time
to
make
a
shift
with
the
leprosy
about
so
i
saddled
up
my
horses
and
i
whistled
to
my
dog
and
i
left
his
scabby
station
at
the
old
i
went
to
illawarra
where
my
brother
got
a
farm
he
has
to
ask
his
landlord
leave
before
he
lifts
his
arm
the
landlord
owns
the
country
side
man
woman
dog
and
cat
they
have
the
cheek
to
dare
to
speak
without
they
touch
their
hat
it
was
shift
boys
shift
for
there
was
the
slightest
doubt
their
little
landlord
god
and
i
would
soon
have
fallen
out
was
i
to
touch
my
hat
to
him
was
i
his
bloomin
dog
so
i
makes
for
up
the
country
at
the
old
but
it
time
that
i
was
movin
i
a
mighty
way
to
go
till
i
drink
artesian
water
from
a
thousand
feet
below
till
i
meet
the
overlanders
with
the
cattle
comin
down
and
i
work
a
while
till
i
make
a
pile
then
have
a
spree
in
town
so
it
shift
boys
shift
for
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
we
got
to
make
a
shift
to
the
stations
further
out
the
runs
behind
us
for
he
follows
like
a
dog
and
we
cross
a
lot
of
country
at
the
old
how
gilbert
died
there
never
a
stone
at
the
sleeper
head
there
never
a
fence
beside
and
the
wandering
stock
on
the
grave
may
tread
unnoticed
and
undenied
but
the
smallest
child
on
the
watershed
can
tell
you
how
gilbert
died
for
he
rode
at
dusk
with
his
comrade
dunn
to
the
hut
at
the
stockman
ford
in
the
waning
light
of
the
sinking
sun
they
peered
with
a
fierce
accord
they
were
outlaws
both
and
on
each
man
head
was
a
thousand
pounds
reward
they
had
taken
toll
of
the
country
round
and
the
troopers
came
behind
with
a
black
that
tracked
like
a
human
hound
in
the
scrub
and
the
ranges
blind
he
could
run
the
trail
where
a
white
man
eye
no
sign
of
a
track
could
find
he
had
hunted
them
out
of
the
one
tree
hill
and
over
the
old
man
plain
but
they
wheeled
their
tracks
with
a
wild
beast
skill
and
they
made
for
the
range
again
then
away
to
the
hut
where
their
grandsire
dwelt
they
rode
with
a
loosened
rein
and
their
grandsire
gave
them
a
greeting
bold
in
and
rest
in
peace
no
safer
place
does
the
country
hold
with
the
night
pursuit
must
cease
and
we
drink
success
to
the
roving
boys
and
to
hell
with
the
black
police
but
they
went
to
death
when
they
entered
there
in
the
hut
at
the
stockman
ford
for
their
grandsire
words
were
as
false
as
fair
they
were
doomed
to
the
hangman
cord
he
had
sold
them
both
to
the
black
police
for
the
sake
of
the
big
reward
in
the
depth
of
night
there
are
forms
that
glide
as
stealthy
as
serpents
creep
and
around
the
hut
where
the
outlaws
hide
they
plant
in
the
shadows
deep
and
they
wait
till
the
first
faint
flush
of
dawn
shall
waken
their
prey
from
sleep
but
gilbert
wakes
while
the
night
is
dark
a
restless
sleeper
aye
he
has
heard
the
sound
of
a
bark
and
his
horse
warning
neigh
and
he
says
to
his
mate
are
hawks
abroad
and
it
time
that
we
went
away
their
rifles
stood
at
the
stretcher
head
their
bridles
lay
to
hand
they
wakened
the
old
man
out
of
his
bed
when
they
heard
the
sharp
command
the
name
of
the
queen
lay
down
your
arms
now
dunn
and
gilbert
stand
then
gilbert
reached
for
his
rifle
true
that
close
at
his
hand
he
kept
he
pointed
it
straight
at
the
voice
and
drew
but
never
a
flash
outleapt
for
the
water
ran
from
the
rifle
breech
it
was
drenched
while
the
outlaws
slept
then
he
dropped
the
piece
with
a
bitter
oath
and
he
turned
to
his
comrade
dunn
are
sold
he
said
are
dead
men
both
but
there
may
be
a
chance
for
one
i
stop
and
i
fight
with
the
pistol
here
you
take
to
your
heels
and
run
so
dunn
crept
out
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
dim
light
and
he
made
his
way
to
a
patch
of
trees
and
vanished
among
the
night
and
the
trackers
hunted
his
tracks
all
day
but
they
never
could
trace
his
flight
but
gilbert
walked
from
the
open
door
in
a
confident
style
and
rash
he
heard
at
his
side
the
rifles
roar
and
he
heard
the
bullets
crash
but
he
laughed
as
he
lifted
his
and
he
fired
at
the
rifle
flash
then
out
of
the
shadows
the
troopers
aimed
at
his
voice
and
the
pistol
sound
with
the
rifle
flashes
the
darkness
flamed
he
staggered
and
spun
around
and
they
riddled
his
body
with
rifle
balls
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
there
never
a
stone
at
the
sleeper
head
there
never
a
fence
beside
and
the
wandering
stock
on
the
grave
may
tread
unnoticed
and
undenied
but
the
smallest
child
on
the
watershed
can
tell
you
how
gilbert
died
the
flying
gang
i
served
my
time
in
the
days
gone
by
in
the
railway
clash
and
clang
and
i
worked
my
way
to
the
end
and
i
was
the
head
of
the
gang
was
a
chosen
band
that
was
kept
at
hand
in
case
of
an
urgent
need
was
it
south
or
north
we
were
started
forth
and
away
at
our
utmost
speed
if
word
reached
town
that
a
bridge
was
down
the
imperious
summons
rang
out
with
the
pilot
engine
sharp
and
away
with
the
flying
gang
then
a
piercing
scream
and
a
rush
of
steam
as
the
engine
moved
ahead
with
a
measured
beat
by
the
slum
and
street
of
the
busy
town
we
fled
by
the
uplands
bright
and
the
homesteads
white
with
the
rush
of
the
western
gale
and
the
pilot
swayed
with
the
pace
we
made
as
she
rocked
on
the
ringing
rail
and
the
country
children
clapped
their
hands
as
the
engine
echoes
rang
but
their
elders
said
is
work
ahead
when
they
send
for
the
flying
gang
then
across
the
miles
of
the
saltbush
plain
that
gleamed
with
the
morning
dew
where
the
grasses
waved
like
the
ripening
grain
the
pilot
engine
flew
a
fiery
rush
in
the
open
bush
where
the
grade
marks
seemed
to
fly
and
the
order
sped
on
the
wires
ahead
the
pilot
go
by
the
governor
special
must
stand
aside
and
the
fast
express
go
hang
let
your
orders
be
that
the
line
is
free
for
the
boys
of
the
flying
gang
shearing
at
castlereagh
the
bell
is
set
and
the
engine
gives
a
toot
there
five
and
thirty
shearers
here
are
shearing
for
the
loot
so
stir
yourselves
you
and
shove
the
sheep
along
the
musterers
are
fetching
them
a
hundred
thousand
strong
and
make
your
collie
dogs
speak
up
what
would
the
buyers
say
in
london
if
the
wool
was
late
this
year
from
castlereagh
the
man
that
the
tubbo
shed
is
not
the
ringer
here
that
stripling
from
the
cooma
side
can
teach
him
how
to
shear
they
trim
away
the
ragged
locks
and
rip
the
cutter
goes
and
leaves
a
track
of
snowy
fleece
from
brisket
to
the
nose
it
lovely
how
they
peel
it
off
with
never
stop
nor
stay
they
racing
for
the
ringer
place
this
year
at
castlereagh
the
man
that
keeps
the
cutters
sharp
is
growling
in
his
cage
he
always
in
a
hurry
and
he
always
in
a
rage
you
turn
a
fellow
sick
you
pass
yourselves
as
shearers
you
were
born
to
swing
a
pick
another
broken
cutter
here
that
two
you
broke
it
awful
how
such
crawlers
come
to
shear
at
castlereagh
the
youngsters
picking
up
the
fleece
enjoy
the
merry
din
they
throw
the
classer
up
the
fleece
he
throws
it
to
the
bin
the
pressers
standing
by
the
rack
are
waiting
for
the
wool
there
room
for
just
a
couple
more
the
press
is
nearly
full
now
jump
upon
the
lever
lads
and
heave
and
heave
away
another
bale
of
golden
fleece
is
branded
the
wind
message
there
came
a
whisper
down
the
bland
between
the
dawn
and
dark
above
the
tossing
of
the
pines
above
the
river
flow
it
stirred
the
boughs
of
giant
gums
and
stalwart
ironbark
it
drifted
where
the
wild
ducks
played
amid
the
swamps
below
it
brought
a
breath
of
mountain
air
from
off
the
hills
of
pine
a
scent
of
eucalyptus
trees
in
bloom
and
drifting
drifting
far
away
along
the
southern
line
it
caught
from
leaf
and
grass
and
fern
a
subtle
strange
perfume
it
reached
the
toiling
city
folk
but
few
there
were
that
heard
the
rattle
of
their
busy
life
had
choked
the
whisper
down
and
some
but
caught
a
breeze
with
scent
of
pine
that
stirred
a
thought
of
blue
hills
far
away
beyond
the
smoky
town
and
others
heard
the
whisper
pass
but
could
not
understand
the
magic
of
the
breeze
breath
that
set
their
hearts
aglow
nor
how
the
roving
wind
could
bring
across
the
overland
a
sound
of
voices
silent
now
and
songs
of
long
ago
but
some
that
heard
the
whisper
clear
were
filled
with
vague
unrest
the
breeze
had
brought
its
message
home
they
could
not
fixed
abide
their
fancies
wandered
all
the
day
towards
the
blue
hills
breast
towards
the
sunny
slopes
that
lie
along
the
riverside
the
mighty
rolling
western
plains
are
very
fair
to
see
where
waving
to
the
passing
breeze
the
silver
myalls
stand
but
fairer
are
the
giant
hills
all
rugged
though
they
be
from
which
the
two
great
rivers
rise
that
run
along
the
bland
oh
rocky
range
and
rugged
spur
and
river
running
clear
that
swings
around
the
sudden
bends
with
swirl
of
foam
though
we
your
sons
are
far
away
we
sometimes
seem
to
hear
the
message
that
the
breezes
bring
to
call
the
wanderers
home
the
mountain
peaks
are
white
with
snow
that
feeds
a
thousand
rills
along
the
river
banks
the
maize
grows
tall
on
virgin
land
and
we
shall
live
to
see
once
more
those
sunny
southern
hills
and
strike
once
more
the
bridle
track
that
leads
along
the
bland
johnson
antidote
down
along
the
snakebite
river
where
the
overlanders
camp
where
the
serpents
are
in
millions
all
of
the
most
deadly
stamp
where
the
in
terror
nearly
every
time
he
bakes
mixes
up
among
the
doughboys
where
the
wily
walks
in
pants
and
defies
the
stings
of
scorpions
and
the
bites
of
ants
where
the
adder
and
the
viper
tear
each
other
by
the
throat
there
it
was
that
william
johnson
sought
his
antidote
johnson
was
a
and
his
brain
went
rather
queer
for
the
constant
sight
of
serpents
filled
him
with
a
deadly
fear
so
he
tramped
his
morning
afternoon
and
night
seeking
for
some
great
specific
that
would
cure
the
serpent
bite
till
king
billy
of
the
mooki
chieftain
of
the
head
told
him
snake
bite
pfeller
pfeller
mostly
drop
down
dead
snake
bite
old
goanna
then
you
watch
a
while
you
see
old
goanna
cure
himself
with
eating
little
pfeller
tree
the
cure
said
william
johnson
me
out
this
plant
sublime
but
king
billy
feeling
lazy
said
he
go
another
time
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
johnson
having
got
the
tale
by
rote
followed
every
stray
goanna
seeking
for
the
antidote
loafing
once
beside
the
river
while
he
thought
his
heart
would
break
there
he
saw
a
big
goanna
fighting
with
a
in
and
out
they
rolled
and
wriggled
bit
each
other
heart
and
soul
till
the
valiant
old
goanna
swallowed
his
opponent
whole
breathless
johnson
sat
and
watched
him
saw
him
struggle
up
the
bank
saw
him
nibbling
at
the
branches
of
some
bushes
green
and
rank
saw
him
happy
and
contented
lick
his
lips
as
off
he
crept
while
the
bulging
in
his
stomach
showed
where
his
opponent
slept
then
a
cheer
of
exultation
burst
aloud
from
johnson
throat
at
last
said
he
struck
it
is
the
famous
antidote
it
is
the
grand
elixir
greatest
blessing
ever
known
twenty
thousand
men
in
india
die
each
year
of
snakes
alone
think
of
all
the
foreign
nations
negro
chow
and
blackamoor
saved
from
sudden
expiration
by
my
wondrous
snakebite
cure
it
will
bring
me
fame
and
fortune
in
the
happy
days
to
be
men
of
every
clime
and
nation
will
be
round
to
gaze
on
me
scientific
men
in
thousands
men
of
mark
and
men
of
note
rushing
down
the
mooki
river
after
johnson
antidote
it
will
cure
delirium
tremens
when
the
patient
eyeballs
stare
at
imaginary
spiders
snakes
which
really
are
not
there
when
he
thinks
he
sees
them
wriggle
when
he
thinks
he
sees
them
bloat
it
will
cure
him
just
to
think
of
johnson
snakebite
antidote
then
he
rushed
to
the
museum
found
a
scientific
man
me
out
a
deadly
serpent
just
the
deadliest
you
can
i
intend
to
let
him
bite
me
all
the
risk
i
will
endure
just
to
prove
the
sterling
value
of
my
wondrous
snakebite
cure
even
though
an
adder
bit
me
back
to
life
again
i
float
snakes
are
out
of
date
i
tell
you
since
i
found
the
antidote
said
the
scientific
person
you
really
want
to
die
go
ahead
but
if
you
doubtful
let
your
have
a
try
get
a
pair
of
dogs
and
try
it
let
the
snake
give
both
a
nip
give
your
dog
the
snakebite
mixture
let
the
other
fellow
rip
if
he
dies
and
yours
survives
him
then
it
proves
the
thing
is
good
will
you
fetch
your
dog
and
try
it
johnson
rather
thought
he
would
so
he
went
and
fetched
his
canine
hauled
him
forward
by
the
throat
old
man
says
he
show
them
we
the
genwine
antidote
both
the
dogs
were
duly
loaded
with
the
contents
johnson
gave
his
dog
the
mixture
then
sat
down
to
wait
events
he
said
twenty
minutes
stump
be
round
while
the
other
wretched
creature
lies
a
corpse
upon
the
ground
but
alas
for
william
johnson
ere
they
watched
a
spell
stumpy
was
as
dead
as
mutton
dog
was
live
and
well
and
the
scientific
person
hurried
off
with
utmost
speed
tested
johnson
drug
and
found
it
was
a
deadly
half
a
tumbler
killed
an
emu
half
a
spoonful
killed
a
goat
all
the
snakes
on
earth
were
harmless
to
that
awful
antidote
down
along
the
mooki
river
on
the
overlanders
camp
where
the
serpents
are
in
millions
all
of
the
most
deadly
stamp
wanders
daily
william
johnson
down
among
those
poisonous
hordes
shooting
every
stray
goanna
calls
them
and
yaller
frauds
and
king
billy
of
the
mooki
cadging
for
the
coat
somehow
seems
to
dodge
the
subject
of
the
antidote
ambition
and
art

i
am
the
maid
of
the
lustrous
eyes
of
great
fruition
whom
the
sons

shalt
wake
from
sleep
with
a
startled
cry
in
fright
upleaping
at
a
rival
step
as
it
passes
by
whilst
thou
art
sleeping
honour
and
truth
shall
be
overthrown
in
fierce
desire
thou
shalt
use
thy
friend
as
a
to
mount
thee
higher
when
the
curtain
falls
on
the
sordid
strife
that
seemed
so
splendid
thou
shalt
look
with
pain
on
the
wasted
life
that
thou
hast
ended
thou
hast
sold
thy
life
for
a
guerdon
small
in
fitful
flashes
there
has
been
reward
but
the
end
of
all
is
dust
and
ashes
for
the
night
has
come
and
it
brings
to
naught
thy
projects
cherished
and
thine
epitaph
shall
in
brass
be
wrought
lived
and
perished
art
i
wait
for
thee
at
the
outer
gate
my
love
mine
only
wherefore
tarriest
thou
so
late
while
i
am
lonely
thou
shalt
seek
my
side
with
a
footstep
swift
in
thee
implanted
is
the
love
of
art
and
the
greatest
gift
that
god
has
granted
and
the
world
concerns
with
its
rights
and
wrongs
shall
seem
but
small
things
poet
or
painter
a
singer
of
songs
thine
art
is
all
things
for
the
wine
of
life
is
a
woman
love
to
keep
beside
thee
but
the
love
of
art
is
a
thing
above
a
star
to
guide
thee
as
the
years
go
by
with
thy
love
of
art
all
undiminished
thou
shalt
end
thy
days
with
a
quiet
heart
thy
work
is
finished
so
the
painter
fashions
a
picture
strong
that
fadeth
never
and
the
singer
singeth
a
song
that
lives
for
ever
the
daylight
is
dying
the
daylight
is
dying
away
in
the
west
the
wild
birds
are
flying
in
silence
to
rest
in
leafage
and
frondage
where
shadows
are
deep
they
pass
to
its
bondage
the
kingdom
of
sleep
and
watched
in
their
sleeping
by
stars
in
the
height
they
rest
in
your
keeping
oh
wonderful
night
when
night
doth
her
glories
of
starshine
unfold
is
then
that
the
stories
of
are
told
unnumbered
i
hold
them
in
memories
bright
but
who
could
unfold
them
or
read
them
aright
beyond
all
denials
the
stars
in
their
glories
the
breeze
in
the
myalls
are
part
of
these
stories
the
waving
of
grasses
the
song
of
the
river
that
sings
as
it
passes
for
ever
and
ever
the
rattle
the
calling
of
birds
the
lowing
of
cattle
must
blend
with
the
words
without
these
indeed
you
would
find
it
ere
long
as
though
i
should
read
you
the
words
of
a
song
that
lamely
would
linger
when
lacking
the
rune
the
voice
of
the
singer
the
lilt
of
the
tune
but
as
one
an
refrain
with
memory
clearing
recalls
it
again
these
tales
roughly
wrought
of
the
bush
and
its
ways
may
call
back
a
thought
of
the
wandering
days
and
blending
with
each
in
the
that
throng
there
haply
shall
reach
you
some
echo
of
song
in
defence
of
the
bush
so
you
back
from
up
the
country
mister
townsman
where
you
went
and
you
cursing
all
the
business
in
a
bitter
discontent
well
we
grieve
to
disappoint
you
and
it
makes
us
sad
to
hear
that
it
was
cool
and
shady
and
there
was
plenty
beer
and
the
loony
bullock
snorted
when
you
first
came
into
view
well
you
know
it
not
so
often
that
he
sees
a
swell
like
you
and
the
roads
were
hot
and
dusty
and
the
plains
were
burnt
and
brown
and
no
doubt
you
better
suited
drinking
in
town
yet
perchance
if
you
should
journey
down
the
very
track
you
went
in
a
month
or
two
at
furthest
you
would
wonder
what
it
meant
where
the
sunbaked
earth
was
gasping
like
a
creature
in
its
pain
you
would
find
the
grasses
waving
like
a
field
of
summer
grain
and
the
miles
of
thirsty
gutters
blocked
with
sand
and
choked
with
mud
you
would
find
them
mighty
rivers
with
a
turbid
sweeping
flood
for
the
rain
and
drought
and
sunshine
make
no
changes
in
the
street
in
the
sullen
line
of
buildings
and
the
ceaseless
tramp
of
feet
but
the
bush
hath
moods
and
changes
as
the
seasons
rise
and
fall
and
the
men
who
know
the
they
are
loyal
through
it
all
but
you
found
the
bush
was
dismal
and
a
land
of
no
delight
did
you
chance
to
hear
a
chorus
in
the
shearers
huts
at
night
did
they
up
william
riley
by
the
cheery
blaze
did
they
rise
him
as
we
rose
him
in
the
good
old
droving
days
and
the
women
of
the
homesteads
and
the
men
you
chanced
to
meet
were
their
faces
sour
and
saddened
like
the
in
the
street
and
the
selector
children
were
they
better
now
or
worse
than
the
little
city
urchins
who
would
greet
you
with
a
curse
is
not
such
a
life
much
better
than
the
squalid
street
and
square
where
the
fallen
women
flaunt
it
in
the
fierce
electric
glare
where
the
sempstress
plies
her
sewing
till
her
eyes
are
sore
and
red
in
a
filthy
dirty
attic
toiling
on
for
daily
bread
did
you
hear
no
sweeter
voices
in
the
music
of
the
bush
than
the
roar
of
trams
and
and
the
of
push
did
the
magpies
rouse
your
slumbers
with
their
carol
sweet
and
strange
did
you
hear
the
silver
chiming
of
the
on
the
range
but
perchance
the
wild
birds
music
by
your
senses
was
despised
for
you
say
you
stay
in
townships
till
the
bush
is
civilised
would
you
make
it
a
and
on
sundays
have
a
band
where
the
might
take
their
with
a
close
at
hand
you
had
better
stick
to
sydney
and
make
merry
with
the
for
the
bush
will
never
suit
you
and
you
never
suit
the
bush
last
week
oh
the
went
to
the
back
block
run
but
he
should
have
gone
there
last
week
he
tramped
ten
miles
with
a
loaded
gun
but
of
turkey
or
duck
he
saw
never
a
one
for
he
should
have
been
there
last
week
they
said
there
were
flocks
of
there
last
week
he
wended
his
way
to
a
waterfall
and
he
should
have
gone
there
last
week
he
carried
a
camera
legs
and
all
but
the
day
was
hot
and
the
stream
was
small
for
he
should
have
gone
there
last
week
they
said
they
drowned
a
man
there
last
week
he
went
for
a
drive
and
he
made
a
start
which
should
have
been
made
last
week
for
the
old
horse
died
of
a
broken
heart
so
he
footed
it
home
and
he
dragged
the
cart
but
the
horse
was
all
right
last
week
they
said
he
trotted
a
match
last
week
so
he
asked
the
bushies
who
came
from
far
to
visit
the
town
last
week
if
they
dine
with
him
and
they
said
but
there
was
a
drop
in
the
whisky
jar
you
should
have
been
here
last
week
he
said
i
drank
it
all
up
last
week
those
names
the
shearers
sat
in
the
firelight
hearty
and
hale
and
strong
after
the
hard
day
shearing
passing
the
joke
along
the
that
shore
a
hundred
as
they
never
were
shorn
before
and
the
novice
who
toiling
bravely
had
half
a
score
the
tarboy
the
cook
and
the
slushy
the
sweeper
that
swept
the
board
the
and
the
penner
with
the
rest
of
the
shearing
horde
there
were
men
from
the
inland
stations
where
the
skies
like
a
furnace
glow
and
men
from
the
snowy
river
the
land
of
the
frozen
snow
there
were
swarthy
queensland
drovers
who
reckoned
all
land
by
miles
and
farmers
sons
from
the
murray
where
many
a
vineyard
smiles
they
started
at
telling
stories
when
they
wearied
of
cards
and
games
and
to
give
these
stories
a
flavour
they
threw
in
some
local
names
and
a
man
from
the
bleak
monaro
away
on
the
tableland
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
and
he
started
to
play
his
hand
he
told
them
of
adjintoothbong
where
the
mountains
freeze
and
the
weight
of
the
snow
in
summer
breaks
branches
off
the
trees
and
as
he
warmed
to
the
business
he
let
them
have
it
strong
nimitybelle
conargo
wheeo
bongongolong
he
lingered
over
them
fondly
because
they
recalled
to
mind
a
thought
of
the
old
bush
homestead
and
the
girl
that
he
left
behind
then
the
shearers
all
sat
silent
till
a
man
in
the
corner
rose
said
he
travelled
but
never
heard
names
like
those
out
in
the
western
districts
out
on
the
castlereagh
most
of
the
names
are
easy
short
for
a
man
to
say
heard
of
mungrybambone
and
the
gundabluey
pine
quobbotha
girilambone
and
terramungamine
quambone
eunonyhareenyha
wee
waa
and
buntijo
but
the
rest
of
the
shearers
stopped
him
the
sake
of
your
jaw
go
slow
if
you
reckon
those
names
are
short
ones
out
where
such
names
prevail
just
try
and
remember
some
long
ones
before
you
begin
the
tale
and
the
man
from
the
western
district
though
never
a
word
he
said
just
winked
with
his
dexter
eyelid
and
then
he
retired
to
bed
a
bush
christening
on
the
outer
barcoo
where
the
churches
are
few
and
men
of
religion
are
scanty
on
a
road
never
cross
by
folk
that
are
lost
one
michael
magee
had
a
shanty
now
this
mike
was
the
dad
of
a
ten
year
old
lad
plump
healthy
and
stoutly
conditioned
he
was
strong
as
the
best
but
poor
mike
had
no
rest
for
the
youngster
had
never
been
christened
and
his
wife
used
to
cry
the
darlin
should
die
saint
peter
would
not
recognise
him
but
by
luck
he
survived
till
a
preacher
arrived
who
agreed
straightaway
to
baptise
him
now
the
artful
young
rogue
while
they
held
their
collogue
with
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
was
listenin
and
he
muttered
in
fright
while
his
features
turned
white
the
divil
and
all
is
this
christenin
he
was
none
of
your
dolts
he
had
seen
them
brand
colts
and
it
seemed
to
his
small
understanding
if
the
man
in
the
frock
made
him
one
of
the
flock
it
must
mean
something
very
like
branding
so
away
with
a
rush
he
set
off
for
the
bush
while
the
tears
in
his
eyelids
they
glistened
outrageous
says
he
brand
youngsters
like
me
i
be
dashed
if
i
stop
to
be
christened
like
a
young
native
dog
he
ran
into
a
log
and
his
father
with
language
uncivil
never
heeding
the
cried
aloud
in
his
haste
out
and
be
christened
you
divil
but
he
lay
there
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
and
his
parents
in
vain
might
reprove
him
till
his
reverence
spoke
he
was
fond
of
a
joke
a
notion
says
he
move
him
a
stick
up
the
log
give
the
spalpeen
a
prog
poke
him
aisy
do
hurt
him
or
maim
him
is
not
long
that
he
stand
i
the
water
at
hand
as
he
rushes
out
this
end
i
name
him
he
comes
and
for
shame
ye
forgotten
the
name
is
it
patsy
or
michael
or
dinnis
here
the
youngster
ran
out
and
the
priest
gave
a
shout
your
chance
anyhow
wid
as
the
howling
young
cub
ran
away
to
the
scrub
where
he
knew
that
pursuit
would
be
risky
the
priest
as
he
fled
flung
a
flask
at
his
head
that
was
labelled
and
maginnis
magee
has
been
made
a
and
the
one
thing
he
hates
more
than
sin
is
to
be
asked
by
the
folk
who
have
heard
of
the
joke
how
he
came
to
be
christened
how
the
favourite
beat
us
said
the
boozer
tell
you
it
true
sir
i
once
was
a
punter
with
plenty
of
pelf
but
gone
is
my
glory
i
tell
you
the
story
how
i
stiffened
my
horse
and
got
stiffened
myself
a
mare
called
the
cracker
i
came
down
to
back
her
but
found
she
was
favourite
all
of
a
rush
the
folk
just
did
pour
on
to
lay
six
to
four
on
and
several
bookies
were
killed
in
the
crush
seems
old
tomato
was
stiff
though
a
starter
they
reckoned
him
fit
for
the
caulfield
to
keep
the
bloke
and
the
donah
were
scratched
by
their
owner
he
only
was
offered
of
the
sweep
knew
salamander
was
slow
as
a
gander
the
mare
could
have
beat
him
the
length
of
the
straight
and
old
manumission
was
out
of
condition
and
most
of
the
others
were
running
off
weight
doubt
someone
it
for
everyone
knew
it
the
bets
were
all
gone
and
i
muttered
in
spite
i
ca
get
a
copper
by
jingo
i
stop
her
let
the
public
fall
in
it
will
serve
the
brutes
right
said
to
the
jockey
listen
my
cocky
you
watch
as
you
cantering
down
by
the
stand
i
wait
where
that
toff
is
and
give
you
the
office
you
only
to
win
if
i
lift
up
my
hand
then
tried
to
back
her
price
is
the
cracker
books
are
all
full
sir
each
bookie
did
swear
my
mind
then
i
made
up
my
fortune
i
played
up
i
bet
every
shilling
against
my
own
mare
strolled
to
the
gateway
the
mare
in
the
straightway
was
shifting
and
dancing
and
pawing
the
ground
the
boy
saw
me
enter
and
wheeled
for
his
canter
when
a
darned
great
mosquito
came
buzzing
around
breed
at
hexham
it
risky
to
vex
they
suck
a
man
dry
at
a
sitting
no
doubt
but
just
as
the
mare
passed
he
fluttered
my
hair
past
i
lifted
my
hand
and
i
flattened
him
out
was
stunned
when
they
started
the
mare
simply
darted
away
to
the
front
when
the
flag
was
let
fall
for
none
there
could
match
her
and
none
tried
to
catch
her
she
finished
a
furlong
in
front
of
them
all
bet
that
i
went
for
the
boy
whom
i
sent
for
the
moment
he
weighed
and
came
out
of
the
stand
paid
you
to
win
it

own

this
minute

said
he

lifted
your
hand

peter
that
cursed

broke
me

brown
and

son
should
do
the
deed
o
guilt
let
the
whuskey
spigot
run
and
a
the
whuskey
spilt
upon
them
both
these
words
did
bring
a
solemn
silence
deep
gude
faith
it
is
a
fearsome
thing
to
see
two
strong
men
weep
as
i
pondered
very
weary
a
volume
long
and
dreary
for
the
plot
was
void
of
interest
was
the
postal
guide
in
fact
there
i
learnt
the
true
location
distance
size
and
population
of
each
township
town
and
village
in
the
radius
of
the
act
and
i
learnt
that
puckawidgee
stands
beside
the
murrumbidgee
and
that
booleroi
and
bumble
get
their
letters
twice
a
year
also
that
the
post
inspector
when
he
visited
collector
closed
the
office
up
instanter
and
dungalear
but
my
languid
mood
forsook
me
when
i
found
a
name
that
took
me
quite
by
chance
i
came
across
it
was
what
i
read
no
location
was
assigned
it
not
a
thing
to
help
one
find
it
just
an
n
which
stood
for
northward
and
the
rest
was
all
unsaid
i
shall
leave
my
home
and
forthward
wander
stoutly
to
the
northward
till
i
come
by
chance
across
it
and
i
straightway
settle
down
for
there
ca
be
any
hurry
nor
the
slightest
cause
for
worry
where
the
telegraph
do
reach
you
nor
the
railways
run
to
town
and
one
letters
and
exchanges
come
by
chance
across
the
ranges
where
a
wiry
young
australian
leads
a
once
a
week
and
the
good
news
grows
by
keeping
and
you
spared
the
pain
of
weeping
over
bad
news
when
the
mailman
drops
the
letters
in
the
creek
but
i
fear
and
more
the
pity
that
there
really
no
such
city
for
there
not
a
man
can
find
it
of
the
shrewdest
folk
i
know
be
sure
it
never
means
a
land
of
fierce
endeavour
it
is
just
the
careless
country
where
the
dreamers
only
go
though
we
work
and
toil
and
hustle
in
our
life
of
haste
and
bustle
all
that
makes
our
life
worth
living
comes
unstriven
for
and
free
man
may
weary
and
importune
but
the
fickle
goddess
fortune
deals
him
out
his
pain
or
pleasure
careless
what
his
worth
may
be
all
the
happy
times
entrancing
days
of
sport
and
nights
of
dancing
moonlit
rides
and
stolen
kisses
pouting
lips
and
loving
glance
when
you
think
of
these
be
certain
you
have
looked
behind
the
curtain
you
have
had
the
luck
to
linger
just
a
while
in
under
the
shadow
of
kiley
hill
this
is
the
place
where
they
all
were
bred
some
of
the
rafters
are
standing
still

they
are
scattered
and
lost
and
dead
every
one
from
the
old
nest
fled
out
of
the
shadow
of

better
it
is
that
they
came

rung

kept
with

left
to
decay
at
its

sweet

on

barcoo
watching
his
cattle
the
long
year
through
watching
them
starve
in
the
droughts
and
die
one
in
the
town
where
all
cares
are
rife
weary
with
troubles
that
cramp

fain
would
be
done
with
the
restless
strife
fain
would
go
back

the

back

away
on
the
roving
quest
seeking
his

the
golden
spoil

west

down

straightens
up

the
swagman
rest
we
buried
old
bob
where
the
bloodwoods
wave
at
the
foot
of
the
eaglehawk
we
fashioned
a
cross
on
the
old
man
grave
for
fear
that
his
ghost
might
walk
we
carved
his
name
on
a
bloodwood
tree
with
the
date
of
his
sad
decease
and
in
place
of
from
effects
of
spree
we
wrote
he
rest
in
peace
for
bob
was
known
on
the
overland
a
regular
old
bush
wag
tramping
along
in
the
dust
and
sand
humping
his
swag
he
would
camp
for
days
in
the
and
loiter
and
for
whales
into
the
swagman
yard
he
said
i
never
shall
find
the
rails
but
he
found
the
rails
on
that
summer
night
for
a
better
place
or
worse
as
we
watched
by
turns
in
the
flickering
light
with
an
old
black
gin
for
nurse
the
breeze
came
in
with
the
scent
of
pine
the
river
sounded
clear
when
a
change
came
on
and
we
saw
the
sign
that
told
us
the
end
was
near
but
he
spoke
in
a
cultured
voice
and
low
fancy
they
sent
the
route
i
once
was
an
army
man
you
know
though
now
i
a
drunken
brute
but
bury
me
out
where
the
bloodwoods
wave
and
if
ever
you
fairly
stuck
just
take
and
shovel
me
out
of
the
grave
and
maybe
i
bring
you
luck
i
always
heard
here
his
voice
fell
weak
his
strength
was
sped
he
gasped
and
struggled
and
tried
to
speak
then
fell
in
a
moment
dead
thus
ended
a
wasted
life
and
hard
of
energies
misapplied
old
bob
was
out
of
the
and
over
the
great
divide
the
drought
came
down
on
the
field
and
flock
and
never
a
raindrop
fell
though
the
tortured
moans
of
the
starving
stock
might
soften
a
fiend
from
hell
and
we
thought
of
the
hint
that
the
swagman
gave
when
he
went
to
the
great
unseen
we
shovelled
the
skeleton
out
of
the
grave
to
see
what
his
hint
might
mean
we
dug
where
the
cross
and
the
grave
posts
were
we
shovelled
away
the
mould
when
sudden
a
vein
of
quartz
lay
bare
all
gleaming
with
yellow
gold
was
a
reef
with
never
a
fault
nor
baulk
that
ran
from
the
range
crest
and
the
richest
mine
on
the
eaglehawk
is
known
as
swagman
rest
the
end
from
the
section
of
advertisements
at
the
end
of
the
printing
the
man
from
snowy
river
and
other
verses
by
a
paterson
the
literary
year
book
the
immediate
success
of
this
book
of
bush
ballads
is
without
parallel
in
colonial
literary
annals
nor
can
any
living
english
or
american
poet
boast
so
wide
a
public
always
excepting
rudyard
spectator
these
lines
have
the
true
lyrical
cry
in
them
eloquent
and
ardent
athenaeum
swinging
rattling
ballads
of
ready
humour
ready
pathos
and
crowding
adventure
stirring
and
entertaining
ballads
about
great
rides
in
which
the
lines
gallop
like
the
very
hoofs
of
the
the
times
at
his
best
he
compares
not
unfavourably
with
the
author
of
patchett
martin
in
literature
london
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
absolutely
thoroughly
australian
style
and
character
of
these
new
bush
bards
which
has
given
them
such
immediate
popularity
such
wide
vogue
among
all
classes
of
the
rising
native
westminster
gazette
australia
has
produced
in
a
paterson
a
national
poet
whose
bush
ballads
are
as
distinctly
characteristic
of
the
country
as
burns
poetry
is
characteristic
of
the
scotsman
a
book
like
this
is
worth
a
dozen
of
the
aspiring
idealistic
sort
since
it
has
a
deal
of
rough
laughter
and
a
dash
of
real
tears
in
its
glasgow
herald
these
ballads
are
full
of
such
go
that
the
mere
reading
of
them
make
the
blood
tingle
but
there
are
other
things
in
paterson
book
besides
mere
racing
and
chasing
and
each
piece
bears
the
mark
of
special
local
knowledge
feeling
and
colour
the
poet
has
also
a
note
of
pathos
which
is
always
literary
world
he
gallops
along
with
a
by
no
means
doubtful
music
shouting
his
vigorous
songs
as
he
rides
in
pursuit
of
wild
bush
horses
constraining
us
to
listen
and
applaud
by
dint
of
his
manly
tones
and
capital
subjects
we
turn
to
paterson
roaring
muse
with
instantaneous
gratitude
