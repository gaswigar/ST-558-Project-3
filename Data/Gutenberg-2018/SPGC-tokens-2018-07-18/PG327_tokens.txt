the
princess
aline
by
richard
harding
davis
the
princess
aline
i
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
came
into
the
life
of
morton
carlton
or
morney
carlton
as
men
called
him
of
new
york
city
when
that
young
gentleman
affairs
and
affections
were
best
suited
to
receive
her
had
she
made
her
appearance
three
years
sooner
or
three
years
later
it
is
quite
probable
that
she
would
have
passed
on
out
of
his
life
with
no
more
recognition
from
him
than
would
have
been
expressed
in
a
look
of
admiring
curiosity
but
coming
when
she
did
when
his
time
and
heart
were
both
unoccupied
she
had
an
influence
upon
young
carlton
which
led
him
into
doing
several
wise
and
many
foolish
things
and
which
remained
with
him
always
carlton
had
reached
a
point
in
his
life
and
very
early
in
his
life
when
he
could
afford
to
sit
at
ease
and
look
back
with
modest
satisfaction
to
what
he
had
forced
himself
to
do
and
forward
with
pleasurable
anticipations
to
whatsoever
he
might
choose
to
do
in
the
future
the
world
had
appreciated
what
he
had
done
and
had
put
much
to
his
credit
and
he
was
prepared
to
draw
upon
this
grandly
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
had
found
himself
his
own
master
with
excellent
family
connections
but
with
no
family
his
only
relative
being
a
bachelor
uncle
who
looked
at
life
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
union
club
windows
and
who
objected
to
his
nephew
leaving
harvard
to
take
up
the
study
of
art
in
paris
in
that
city
where
at
julian
he
was
nicknamed
the
junior
carlton
for
the
obvious
reason
that
he
was
the
older
of
the
two
carltons
in
the
class
and
because
he
was
well
dressed
he
had
shown
himself
a
harder
worker
than
others
who
were
less
careful
of
their
appearance
and
of
their
manners
his
work
of
which
he
did
not
talk
and
his
ambitions
of
which
he
also
did
not
talk
bore
fruit
early
and
at
he
had
become
a
of
international
reputation
then
the
french
government
purchased
one
of
his
paintings
at
an
absurdly
small
figure
and
placed
it
in
the
luxembourg
from
whence
it
would
in
time
depart
to
be
buried
in
the
hall
of
some
provincial
city
and
american
millionaires
and
english
lord
mayors
members
of
parliament
and
members
of
the
institute
masters
of
hounds
in
pink
coats
and
ambassadors
in
gold
lace
and
beautiful
women
of
all
nationalities
and
conditions
sat
before
his
easel
and
so
when
he
returned
to
new
york
he
was
welcomed
with
an
enthusiasm
which
showed
that
his
countrymen
had
feared
that
the
artistic
atmosphere
of
the
old
world
had
stolen
him
from
them
forever
he
was
particularly
silent
even
at
this
date
about
his
work
and
listened
to
what
others
had
to
say
of
it
with
much
awe
not
unmixed
with
some
amusement
that
it
should
be
he
who
was
capable
of
producing
anything
worthy
of
such
praise
we
have
been
told
what
the
mother
duck
felt
when
her
ugly
duckling
turned
into
a
swan
but
we
have
never
considered
how
much
the
ugly
duckling
must
have
marvelled
also
carlton
is
probably
the
only
living
artist
a
brother
artist
had
said
of
him
who
fails
to
appreciate
how
great
his
work
is
and
on
this
being
repeated
to
carlton
by
a
friend
he
had
replied
cheerfully
well
i
sorry
but
it
is
certainly
better
to
be
the
only
one
who
does
appreciate
it
than
to
be
the
only
one
who
does
he
had
never
understood
why
such
a
responsibility
had
been
intrusted
to
him
it
was
as
he
expressed
it
not
at
all
in
his
line
and
young
girls
who
sought
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
master
found
him
making
love
to
them
in
the
most
charming
manner
in
the
world
as
though
he
were
not
entitled
to
all
the
rapturous
admiration
of
their
very
young
hearts
but
had
to
sue
for
it
like
any
ordinary
mortal
carlton
always
felt
as
though
some
day
some
one
would
surely
come
along
and
say
look
here
young
man
this
talent
does
belong
to
you
it
mine
what
do
you
mean
by
pretending
that
such
an
idle
youth
as
yourself
is
entitled
to
such
a
gift
of
genius
he
felt
that
he
was
keeping
it
in
trust
as
it
were
that
it
had
been
changed
at
birth
and
that
the
proper
guardian
would
eventually
relieve
him
of
his
treasure
personally
carlton
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
should
have
been
born
in
the
active
days
of
to
have
had
nothing
more
serious
to
do
than
to
ride
abroad
with
a
blue
ribbon
fastened
to
the
point
of
his
lance
and
with
the
spirit
to
unhorse
any
one
who
objected
to
its
color
or
to
the
claims
of
superiority
of
the
noble
lady
who
had
tied
it
there
there
was
not
in
his
opinion
at
the
present
day
any
sufficiently
pronounced
method
of
declaring
admiration
for
the
many
lovely
women
this
world
contained
a
proposal
of
marriage
he
considered
to
be
a
mean
and
clumsy
substitute
for
the
older
way
and
was
uncomplimentary
to
the
many
other
women
left
unasked
and
marriage
itself
required
much
more
constancy
than
he
could
give
he
had
a
most
romantic
and
ideal
of
women
as
a
class
and
from
the
age
of
fourteen
had
been
a
devotee
of
hundreds
of
them
as
individuals
and
though
in
that
time
his
ideal
had
received
several
severe
shocks
he
still
believed
that
the
not
impossible
she
existed
somewhere
and
his
conscientious
efforts
to
find
out
whether
every
women
he
met
might
not
be
that
one
had
led
him
not
unnaturally
into
many
difficulties
the
trouble
with
me
is
he
said
that
i
care
too
much
to
make
platonic
friendship
possible
and
do
care
enough
to
marry
any
particular
woman
that
is
of
course
supposing
that
any
particular
one
would
be
so
little
particular
as
to
be
willing
to
marry
me
how
embarrassing
it
would
be
now
he
argued
if
when
you
were
turning
away
from
the
chancel
after
the
ceremony
you
should
look
at
one
of
the
bridesmaids
and
see
the
woman
whom
you
really
should
have
married
how
distressing
that
would
be
you
could
very
well
stop
and
say
am
very
sorry
my
dear
but
it
seems
i
have
made
a
mistake
that
young
woman
on
the
right
has
a
most
interesting
and
beautiful
face
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
she
is
the
one
it
would
be
too
late
then
while
now
in
my
free
state
i
can
continue
my
search
without
any
sense
of
responsibility
why
he
would
exclaim
i
have
walked
miles
to
get
a
glimpse
of
a
beautiful
woman
in
a
suburban
window
and
time
and
time
again
when
i
have
seen
a
face
in
a
passing
brougham
i
have
pursued
it
in
a
hansom
and
learned
where
the
owner
of
the
face
lived
and
spent
weeks
in
finding
some
one
to
present
me
only
to
discover
that
she
was
or
uninteresting
or
engaged
still
i
had
assured
myself
that
she
was
not
the
one
i
am
very
conscientious
and
i
consider
that
it
is
my
duty
to
go
so
far
with
every
woman
i
meet
as
to
be
able
to
learn
whether
she
is
or
is
not
the
one
and
the
sad
result
is
that
i
am
like
a
man
who
follows
the
hounds
but
is
never
in
at
the
death
well
some
married
woman
would
say
grimly
i
hope
you
will
get
your
deserts
some
day
and
you
will
too
some
day
some
girl
will
make
you
suffer
for
this
oh
that
all
right
carlton
would
answer
meekly
lots
of
women
have
made
me
suffer
if
that
what
you
think
i
need
some
day
the
married
woman
would
prophesy
you
will
care
for
a
woman
so
much
that
you
will
have
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
that
the
way
it
is
when
one
is
married
well
when
that
the
way
it
is
with
me
carlton
would
reply
i
certainly
hope
to
get
married
but
until
it
is
i
think
it
is
safer
for
all
concerned
that
i
should
not
then
carlton
would
go
to
the
club
and
complain
bitterly
to
one
of
his
friends
how
unfair
married
women
are
he
would
say
the
idea
of
thinking
a
man
could
have
no
eyes
but
for
one
woman
suppose
i
had
never
heard
a
note
of
music
until
i
was
years
of
age
and
was
then
given
my
hearing
do
you
suppose
my
pleasure
in
music
would
make
me
lose
my
pleasure
in
everything
else
suppose
i
met
and
married
a
girl
at
is
that
going
to
make
me
forget
all
the
women
i
knew
before
i
met
her
i
think
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
really
deserve
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
remaining
single
for
i
am
naturally
very
affectionate
but
when
i
see
what
poor
husbands
my
friends
make
i
prefer
to
stay
as
i
am
until
i
am
sure
that
i
will
make
a
better
one
it
is
only
fair
to
the
woman
carlton
was
sitting
in
the
club
alone
he
had
that
sense
of
superiority
over
his
fellows
and
of
irresponsibility
to
the
world
about
him
that
comes
to
a
man
when
he
knows
that
his
trunks
are
being
packed
and
that
his
is
engaged
he
was
leaving
new
york
long
before
most
of
his
friends
could
get
away
he
did
not
know
just
where
he
was
going
and
preferred
not
to
know
he
wished
to
have
a
complete
holiday
and
to
see
europe
as
an
idle
tourist
and
not
as
an
artist
with
an
eye
to
his
own
improvement
he
had
plenty
of
time
and
money
he
was
sure
to
run
across
friends
in
the
big
cities
and
acquaintances
he
could
make
or
not
as
he
pleased
en
route
he
was
not
sorry
to
go
his
going
would
serve
to
put
an
end
to
what
gossip
there
might
be
of
his
engagement
to
numerous
young
women
whose
admiration
for
him
as
an
artist
he
was
beginning
to
fear
had
taken
on
a
more
personal
tinge
i
wish
he
said
gloomily
i
did
like
people
so
well
it
seems
to
cause
them
and
me
such
a
lot
of
trouble
he
sighed
and
stretched
out
his
hand
for
a
copy
of
one
of
the
english
illustrated
papers
it
had
a
fresher
interest
to
him
because
the
next
number
of
it
that
he
would
see
would
be
in
the
city
in
which
it
was
printed
the
paper
in
his
hands
was
the
james
budget
and
it
contained
much
fashionable
intelligence
concerning
the
preparations
for
a
royal
wedding
which
was
soon
to
take
place
between
members
of
two
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
there
was
on
one
page
a
reproduction
of
a
photograph
which
showed
a
group
of
young
people
belonging
to
several
of
these
reigning
families
with
their
names
and
titles
printed
above
and
below
the
picture
they
were
princesses
archdukes
or
and
they
were
dressed
like
young
english
men
and
women
and
with
no
sign
about
them
of
their
possible
military
or
social
rank
one
of
the
young
princesses
in
the
photograph
was
looking
out
of
it
and
smiling
in
a
tolerant
amused
way
as
though
she
had
thought
of
something
which
she
could
not
wait
to
enjoy
until
after
the
picture
was
taken
she
was
not
posing
consciously
as
were
some
of
the
others
but
was
sitting
in
a
natural
attitude
with
one
arm
over
the
back
of
her
chair
and
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
her
face
was
full
of
a
fine
intelligence
and
humor
and
though
one
of
the
other
princesses
in
the
group
was
far
more
beautiful
this
particular
one
had
a
much
more
air
and
there
was
something
of
a
challenge
in
her
smile
that
made
any
one
who
looked
at
the
picture
smile
also
carlton
studied
the
face
for
some
time
and
mentally
approved
of
its
beauty
the
others
seemed
in
comparison
wooden
and
unindividual
but
this
one
looked
like
a
person
he
might
have
known
and
whom
he
would
certainly
have
liked
he
turned
the
page
and
surveyed
the
features
of
the
oxford
crew
with
lesser
interest
and
then
turned
the
page
again
and
gazed
critically
and
severely
at
the
face
of
the
princess
with
the
smile
he
had
hoped
that
he
would
find
it
less
interesting
at
a
second
glance
but
it
did
not
prove
to
be
so
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
he
read
she
probably
engaged
to
one
of
those
johnnies
beside
her
and
the
of
hohenwald
behind
her
must
be
her
brother
he
put
the
paper
down
and
went
into
luncheon
and
diverted
himself
by
mixing
a
salad
dressing
but
after
a
few
moments
he
stopped
in
the
midst
of
this
employment
and
told
the
waiter
with
some
unnecessary
sharpness
to
bring
him
the
last
copy
of
the
james
budget
confound
it
he
added
to
himself
he
opened
the
paper
with
a
touch
of
impatience
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
face
of
the
princess
aline
who
continued
to
return
his
look
with
the
same
smile
of
amused
tolerance
carlton
noted
every
detail
of
her
gown
of
her
high
mannish
collar
of
her
tie
and
even
the
rings
on
her
hand
there
was
nothing
about
her
of
which
he
could
fairly
disapprove
he
wondered
why
it
was
that
she
could
not
have
been
born
an
approachable
new
york
girl
instead
of
a
princess
of
a
little
german
duchy
hedged
in
throughout
her
single
life
and
to
be
traded
off
eventually
in
marriage
with
as
much
consideration
as
though
she
were
a
princess
of
a
real
kingdom
she
looks
jolly
too
he
mused
in
an
injured
tone
and
so
very
clever
and
of
course
she
has
a
beautiful
complexion
all
those
german
girls
have
your
royal
highness
is
more
than
pretty
he
said
bowing
his
head
gravely
you
look
as
a
princess
should
look
i
am
sure
it
was
one
of
your
ancestors
who
discovered
the
dried
pea
under
a
dozen
mattresses
he
closed
the
paper
and
sat
for
a
moment
with
a
perplexed
smile
of
consideration
waiter
he
exclaimed
suddenly
send
a
to
brentano
for
a
copy
of
the
james
budget
and
bring
me
the
almanach
de
gotha
from
the
library
it
is
a
little
fat
red
book
on
the
table
near
the
window
then
carlton
opened
the
paper
again
and
propped
it
up
against
a
carafe
and
continued
his
critical
survey
of
the
princess
aline
he
seized
the
almanach
when
it
came
with
some
eagerness
hohenwald
maison
de
grasse
he
read
and
in
small
type
below
it
ligne
cadette
regnante

et
de
grasse
de
hohenwald
et
de
grasse
etc
that
the
brother
right
enough
muttered
carlton
and
under
the
heading
soeurs
he
read
psse
alt
nee
a
grasse
juin
years
old
exclaimed
carlton
what
a
perfect
age
i
could
not
have
invented
a
better
one
he
looked
from
the
book
to
the
face
before
him
now
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
know
all
about
you
you
live
at
grasse
and
you
are
connected
to
judge
by
your
names
with
all
the
english
royalties
and
very
pretty
names
they
are
too
aline
helene
victoria
beatrix
you
must
be
much
more
english
than
you
are
german
and
i
suppose
you
live
in
a
little
old
castle
and
your
brother
has
a
standing
army
of
twelve
men
and
some
day
you
are
to
marry
a
russian
or
whoever
your
brother
prime
minister
if
he
has
a
prime
minister
decides
is
best
for
the
politics
of
your
little
toy
kingdom
ah
to
think
exclaimed
carlton
softly
that
such
a
lovely
and
glorious
creature
as
that
should
be
sacrificed
for
so
insignificant
a
thing
as
the
peace
of
europe
when
she
might
make
some
young
man
happy
he
carried
a
copy
of
the
paper
to
his
room
and
cut
the
picture
of
the
group
out
of
the
page
and
pasted
it
carefully
on
a
stiff
piece
of
then
he
placed
it
on
his
in
front
of
a
photograph
of
a
young
woman
in
a
large
silver
frame
which
was
a
sign
had
the
young
woman
but
known
it
that
her
reign
for
the
time
being
was
over
nolan
the
young
irishman
who
did
for
carlton
knew
better
than
to
move
it
when
he
found
it
there
he
had
learned
to
study
his
master
since
he
had
joined
him
in
london
and
understood
that
one
photograph
in
the
silver
frame
was
entitled
to
more
consideration
than
three
others
on
the
or
half
a
dozen
on
the
nolan
had
seen
them
come
and
go
he
had
watched
them
rise
and
fall
he
had
carried
notes
to
them
and
books
and
flowers
and
had
helped
to
dispose
them
from
the
silver
frame
and
move
them
on
by
degrees
down
the
line
until
they
went
ingloriously
into
the
big
brass
bowl
on
the
side
table
nolan
approved
highly
of
this
last
choice
he
did
not
know
which
one
of
the
three
in
the
group
it
might
be
but
they
were
all
pretty
and
their
social
standing
was
certainly
distinguished
guido
the
italian
model
who
ruled
over
the
studio
and
nolan
were
busily
packing
when
carlton
entered
he
always
said
that
guido
represented
him
in
his
professional
and
nolan
in
his
social
capacity
guido
cleaned
the
brushes
and
purchased
the
artists
materials
nolan
cleaned
his
and
bought
his
theatre
and
railroad
tickets
guido
said
carlton
there
are
two
sketches
i
made
in
germany
last
year
one
of
the
prime
minister
and
one
of
ludwig
the
actor
get
them
out
for
me
will
you
and
pack
them
for
shipping
nolan
he
went
on
here
is
a
telegram
to
send
nolan
would
not
have
read
a
letter
but
he
looked
upon
telegrams
as
public
documents
the
reading
of
them
as
part
of
his
perquisites
this
one
was
addressed
to
oscar
von
holtz
first
secretary
german
embassy
washington
and
the
message
read
please
telegraph
me
full
title
and
address
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
where
would
a
letter
reach
her
morton
carlton
the
next
morning
nolan
carried
to
the
express
office
a
box
containing
two
on
small
canvases
they
were
addressed
to
the
man
in
london
who
attended
to
the
shipping
and
forwarding
of
pictures
in
that
town
there
was
a
tremendous
crowd
on
the
new
york
she
sailed
at
the
obliging
hour
of
eleven
in
the
morning
and
many
people
in
consequence
whose
affection
would
not
have
stood
in
the
way
of
their
breakfast
made
it
a
point
to
appear
and
to
say
goodbye
carlton
for
his
part
did
not
notice
them
he
knew
by
experience
that
the
people
always
leave
a
steamer
when
the
whistle
blows
and
that
the
next
most
who
remain
on
board
are
ill
all
the
way
over
a
man
that
he
knew
seized
him
by
the
arm
as
he
was
entering
his
cabin
and
asked
if
he
were
crossing
or
just
seeing
people
off
well
then
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
miss
morris
and
her
aunt
downs
they
are
going
over
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
be
nice
to
them
but
you
know
her
i
guess
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
as
carlton
pushed
his
way
after
him
down
the
deck
i
know
who
she
is
he
said
miss
edith
morris
was
surrounded
by
a
treble
circle
of
admiring
friends
and
seemed
to
be
holding
her
own
they
all
stopped
when
carlton
came
up
and
looked
at
him
rather
closely
and
those
whom
he
knew
seemed
to
mark
the
fact
by
a
particularly
hearty
greeting
the
man
who
had
brought
him
up
acted
as
though
he
had
successfully
accomplished
a
somewhat
difficult
and
creditable
feat
carlton
bowed
himself
away
leaving
miss
morris
to
her
friends
and
saying
that
she
would
probably
have
to
see
him
later
whether
she
wished
it
or
not
he
then
went
to
meet
the
aunt
who
received
him
kindly
for
there
were
very
few
people
on
the
passenger
list
and
she
was
glad
they
were
to
have
his
company
before
he
left
she
introduced
him
to
a
young
man
named
abbey
who
was
hovering
around
her
most
anxiously
and
whose
interest
she
seemed
to
think
it
necessary
to
explain
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
to
miss
morris
abbey
left
the
steamer
when
the
whistle
blew
and
carlton
looked
after
him
gratefully
he
always
enjoyed
meeting
attractive
girls
who
were
engaged
as
it
left
him
no
choice
in
the
matter
and
excused
him
from
finding
out
whether
or
not
that
particular
young
woman
was
the
one
downs
and
her
niece
proved
to
be
experienced
sailors
and
faced
the
heavy
sea
that
met
the
new
york
outside
of
sandy
hook
with
unconcern
carlton
joined
them
and
they
stood
together
leaning
with
their
backs
to
the
rail
and
trying
to
fit
the
people
who
flitted
past
them
to
the
names
on
the
passenger
list
the
young
lady
in
the
sailor
suit
said
miss
morris
gazing
at
the
top
of
the
is
miss
kitty
flood
of
grand
rapids
this
is
her
first
voyage
and
she
thinks
a
steamer
is
something
like
a
yacht
and
dresses
for
the
part
accordingly
she
does
not
know
that
it
is
merely
a
moving
hotel
i
am
afraid
said
carlton
to
judge
from
her
agitation
that
hers
is
going
to
be
what
the
professionals
call
a
part
why
is
it
he
asked
that
the
girls
on
a
steamer
who
wear
gold
anchors
and
the
men
in
are
always
the
first
to
disappear
that
man
with
the
sombrero
he
went
on
is
james
pollock
united
states
consul
to
mauritius
he
is
going
out
to
his
post
i
know
he
is
the
consul
because
he
comes
from
fort
worth
texas
and
is
therefore
admirably
fitted
to
speak
either
french
or
the
native
language
of
the
island
oh
we
do
send
consuls
to
mauritius
laughed
miss
morris
mauritius
is
one
of
those
places
from
which
you
buy
stamps
but
no
one
really
lives
or
goes
there
where
are
you
going
may
i
ask
inquired
carlton
miss
morris
said
that
they
were
making
their
way
to
constantinople
and
athens
and
then
to
rome
that
as
they
had
not
had
the
time
to
take
the
southern
route
they
purposed
to
journey
across
the
continent
direct
from
paris
to
the
turkish
capital
by
the
orient
express
we
shall
be
a
few
days
in
london
and
in
paris
only
long
enough
for
some
clothes
she
replied
the
trousseau
thought
carlton
weeks
is
what
she
should
have
said
the
three
sat
together
at
the
captain
table
and
as
the
sea
continued
rough
saw
little
of
either
the
captain
or
his
other
guests
and
were
thrown
much
upon
the
society
of
each
other
they
had
innumerable
friends
and
interests
in
common
and
downs
who
had
been
everywhere
and
for
long
seasons
at
a
time
proved
as
alive
as
her
niece
and
carlton
conceived
a
great
liking
for
her
she
seemed
to
be
just
and
kindly
minded
and
owing
to
her
age
to
combine
the
wider
judgment
of
a
man
with
the
sympathetic
interest
of
a
woman
sometimes
they
sat
together
in
a
row
and
read
and
gossiped
over
what
they
read
or
struggled
up
the
deck
as
it
rose
and
fell
and
buffeted
with
the
wind
and
later
they
gathered
in
a
corner
of
the
saloon
and
ate
late
suppers
of
carlton
devising
or
drank
tea
in
the
captain
cabin
which
he
had
thrown
open
to
them
they
had
started
knowing
much
about
one
another
and
this
and
the
necessary
proximity
of
the
ship
hastened
their
acquaintance
the
sea
grew
calmer
the
third
day
out
and
the
sun
came
forth
and
showed
the
decks
as
clean
as
miss
morris
and
carlton
seated
themselves
on
the
huge
iron
in
the
bow
and
with
their
elbows
on
the
rail
looked
down
at
the
whirling
blue
water
and
rejoiced
silently
in
the
steady
rush
of
the
great
vessel
and
in
the
uncertain
warmth
of
the
march
sun
carlton
was
sitting
to
leeward
of
miss
morris
with
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
was
warm
and
at
peace
with
the
world
he
had
found
his
new
acquaintance
more
than
entertaining
she
was
even
friendly
and
treated
him
as
though
he
were
much
her
junior
as
is
the
habit
of
young
women
lately
married
or
who
are
about
to
be
married
carlton
did
not
resent
it
on
the
contrary
it
made
him
more
at
his
ease
with
her
and
as
she
herself
chose
to
treat
him
as
a
youth
he
permitted
himself
to
be
as
foolish
as
he
pleased
i
do
know
why
it
is
he
complained
peering
over
the
rail
but
whenever
i
look
over
the
side
to
watch
the
waves
a
man
in
a
greasy
cap
always
sticks
his
head
out
of
a
hole
below
me
and
scatters
a
barrelful
of
ashes
or
potato
peelings
all
over
the
ocean
it
spoils
the
effect
for
one
next
time
he
does
it
i
am
going
to
knock
out
the
ashes
of
my
pipe
on
the
back
of
his
neck
miss
morris
did
not
consider
this
worthy
of
comment
and
there
was
a
long
lazy
pause
you
have
told
us
where
you
go
after
london
she
said
and
then
without
waiting
for
him
to
reply
she
asked
is
it
your
professional
or
your
social
side
that
you
are
treating
to
a
trip
this
time
who
told
you
that
asked
carlton
smiling
oh
i
do
know
some
man
he
said
you
were
a
jekyll
and
hyde
which
is
jekyll
you
see
i
only
know
your
professional
side
you
must
try
to
find
out
for
yourself
by
deduction
he
said
as
you
picked
out
the
other
passengers
i
am
going
to
grasse
he
continued
it
the
capital
of
hohenwald
do
you
know
it
yes
she
said
we
were
there
once
for
a
few
days
we
went
to
see
the
pictures
i
suppose
you
know
that
the
old
duke
the
father
of
the
present
one
ruined
himself
almost
by
buying
pictures
for
the
grasse
gallery
we
were
there
at
a
bad
time
though
when
the
palace
was
closed
to
visitors
and
the
gallery
too
i
suppose
that
is
what
is
taking
you
there
no
carlton
said
shaking
his
head
no
it
is
not
the
pictures
i
am
going
to
grasse
he
said
gravely
to
see
the
young
woman
with
whom
i
am
in
love
miss
morris
looked
up
in
some
surprise
and
smiled
consciously
with
a
natural
feminine
interest
in
an
affair
of
love
and
one
which
was
a
secret
as
well
oh
she
said
i
beg
your
pardon
we
i
had
not
heard
of
it
no
it
is
not
a
thing
one
could
announce
exactly
said
carlton
it
is
rather
in
an
embryo
state
as
yet
in
fact
i
have
not
met
the
young
lady
so
far
but
i
mean
to
meet
her
that
why
i
am
going
abroad
miss
morris
looked
at
him
sharply
to
see
if
he
were
smiling
but
he
was
on
the
contrary
gazing
sentimentally
at
the
and
puffing
meditatively
on
his
pipe
he
was
apparently
in
earnest
and
waiting
for
her
to
make
some
comment
how
very
interesting
was
all
she
could
think
to
say
yes
when
you
know
the
details
it
is
very
interesting
he
answered
she
is
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
he
explained
bowing
his
head
as
though
he
were
making
the
two
young
ladies
known
to
one
another
she
has
several
other
names
six
in
all
and
her
age
is
that
is
all
i
know
about
her
i
saw
her
picture
in
an
illustrated
paper
just
before
i
sailed
and
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
meet
her
and
here
i
am
if
she
is
not
in
grasse
i
intend
to
follow
her
to
wherever
she
may
be
he
waved
his
pipe
at
the
ocean
before
him
and
recited
with
mock
seriousness
the
hills
and
far
away
beyond
their
utmost
purple
rim
and
deep
into
the
dying
day
the
happy
princess
followed
him
only
in
this
case
you
see
said
carlton
i
am
following
the
happy
princess
no
but
seriously
though
said
miss
morris
what
is
it
you
mean
are
you
going
to
paint
her
portrait
i
never
thought
of
that
exclaimed
carlton
i
do
know
but
what
your
idea
is
a
good
one
miss
morris
that
a
great
idea
he
shook
his
head
approvingly
i
did
not
do
wrong
to
confide
in
you
he
said
it
was
perhaps
taking
a
liberty
but
as
you
have
not
considered
it
as
such
i
am
glad
i
spoke
but
you
do
really
mean
to
tell
me
exclaimed
the
girl
facing
about
and
nodding
her
head
at
him
that
you
are
going
abroad
after
a
woman
whom
you
have
never
seen
and
because
you
like
a
picture
of
her
in
a
paper
i
do
said
carlton
because
i
like
her
picture
and
because
she
is
a
princess
well
upon
my
word
said
miss
morris
gazing
at
him
with
evident
admiration
that
what
my
younger
brother
would
call
a
distinctly
sporting
proposition
only
i
do
see
she
added
what
her
being
a
princess
has
to
do
with
it
you
do
laughed
carlton
easily
that
the
best
part
of
it
that
the
plot
the
beauty
of
being
in
love
with
a
princess
miss
morris
he
said
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
ca
marry
her
that
you
can
love
her
deeply
and
forever
and
nobody
will
ever
come
to
you
and
ask
your
intentions
or
hint
that
after
such
a
display
of
affection
you
ought
to
do
something
now
with
a
girl
who
is
not
a
princess
even
if
she
understands
the
situation
herself
and
would
marry
you
to
save
her
life
still
there
is
always
some
one
a
father
or
a
mother
or
one
of
your
friends
who
makes
it
his
business
to
interfere
and
talks
about
it
and
bothers
you
both
but
with
a
princess
you
see
that
is
all
eliminated
you
ca
marry
a
princess
because
they
wo
let
you
a
princess
has
got
to
marry
a
real
royal
chap
and
so
you
are
perfectly
ineligible
and
free
to
sigh
for
her
and
make
pretty
speeches
to
her
and
see
her
as
often
as
you
can
and
revel
in
your
devotion
and
unrequited
affection
miss
morris
regarded
him
doubtfully
she
did
not
wish
to
prove
herself
too
credulous
and
you
honestly
want
me
carlton
to
believe
that
you
are
going
abroad
just
for
this
you
see
carlton
answered
her
if
you
only
knew
me
better
you
would
have
no
doubt
on
the
subject
at
all
it
is
the
thing
some
men
would
do
i
admit
but
it
is
exactly
what
any
one
who
knows
me
would
expect
of
me
i
should
describe
it
having
had
acquaintance
with
the
young
man
for
some
time
as
being
eminently
characteristic
and
besides
think
what
a
good
story
it
makes
every
other
man
who
goes
abroad
this
summer
will
try
to
tell
about
his
travels
when
he
gets
back
to
new
york
and
as
usual
no
one
will
listen
to
him
but
they
will
have
to
listen
to
me
been
across
since
i
saw
you
last
what
did
you
do
they
ask
politely
and
then
instead
of
simply
telling
them
that
i
have
been
in
paris
or
london
i
can
say
i
been
chasing
around
the
globe
after
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
that
sounds
interesting
does
it
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
carlton
continued
meditatively
it
is
not
so
very
remarkable
men
go
all
the
way
to
cuba
and
mexico
and
even
to
india
after
orchids
after
a
nasty
flower
that
grows
in
an
absurd
way
on
the
top
of
a
tree
why
a
young
man
go
as
far
as
germany
after
a
beautiful
princess
who
walks
on
the
ground
and
who
can
talk
and
think
and
feel
she
is
much
more
worth
while
than
an
orchid
miss
morris
laughed
indulgently
well
i
did
know
such
devotion
existed
at
this
end
of
the
century
she
said
it
quite
nice
and
encouraging
i
hope
you
will
succeed
i
am
sure
i
only
wish
we
were
going
to
be
near
enough
to
see
how
you
get
on
i
have
never
been
a
confidante
when
there
was
a
real
princess
concerned
she
said
it
makes
it
so
much
more
amusing
may
one
ask
what
your
plans
are
carlton
doubted
if
he
had
any
plans
as
yet
i
have
to
reach
the
ground
first
he
said
and
after
that
i
must
reconnoitre
i
may
possibly
adopt
your
idea
and
ask
to
paint
her
portrait
only
i
dislike
confusing
my
social
and
professional
sides
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
he
said
after
a
pause
laughing
guiltily
i
have
done
a
little
of
that
already
i
prepared
her
as
it
were
for
my
coming
i
sent
her
studies
of
two
pictures
i
made
last
winter
in
berlin
one
of
the
prime
minister
and
one
of
ludwig
the
tragedian
at
the
court
theatre
i
sent
them
to
her
through
my
london
agent
so
that
she
would
think
they
had
come
from
some
one
of
her
english
friends
and
i
told
the
dealer
not
to
let
any
one
know
who
had
forwarded
them
my
idea
was
that
it
might
help
me
perhaps
if
she
knew
something
about
me
before
i
appeared
in
person
it
was
a
sort
of
letter
of
introduction
written
by
myself
well
really
expostulated
miss
morris
you
certainly
woo
in
a
royal
way
are
you
in
the
habit
of
giving
away
your
pictures
to
any
one
whose
photograph
you
happen
to
like
that
seems
to
me
to
be
giving
new
lamps
for
old
to
a
degree
i
must
see
if
i
have
some
of
my
photographs
in
my
trunk
she
is
considered
very
beautiful
well
you
wait
until
you
see
this
particular
portrait
and
you
will
understand
it
better
said
carlton
the
steamer
reached
southampton
early
in
the
afternoon
and
carlton
secured
a
special
compartment
on
the
express
to
london
for
downs
and
her
niece
and
himself
with
one
adjoining
for
their
maid
and
nolan
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
carlton
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
passing
fields
and
villages
exclaiming
with
pleasure
from
time
to
time
at
the
white
roads
and
the
feathery
trees
and
hedges
and
the
red
roofs
of
the
inns
and
square
towers
of
the
village
churches
hedges
are
better
than
fences
are
they
he
said
you
see
that
girl
picking
wild
flowers
from
one
of
them
she
looks
just
as
though
she
were
posing
for
a
picture
for
an
illustrated
paper
she
could
pick
flowers
from
a
fence
could
she
and
there
would
probably
be
a
tramp
along
the
road
somewhere
to
frighten
her
and
see
the
chap
in
knickerbockers
farther
down
the
road
leaning
on
the
stile
i
am
sure
he
is
waiting
for
her
and
here
comes
a
coach
he
ran
on
do
the
red
wheels
look
well
against
the
hedges
it
a
pretty
little
country
england
is
it
like
a
private
park
or
a
model
village
i
am
glad
to
get
back
to
it
i
am
glad
to
see
the
signs
with
the
little
slanting
dash
between
the
shillings
and
pennies
yes
even
the
and
the
man
with
the
red
flag
in
front
are
welcome
i
suppose
said
downs
it
because
one
has
been
so
long
on
the
ocean
that
the
ride
to
london
seems
so
interesting
it
always
pays
me
for
the
entire
trip
yes
she
said
with
a
sigh
in
spite
of
the
signs
they
have
taken
to
putting
up
all
along
the
road
it
seems
a
pity
they
should
adopt
our
bad
habits
instead
of
our
good
ones
they
are
a
bit
slow
at
adopting
anything
commented
carlton
did
you
know
downs
that
electric
lights
are
still
as
scarce
in
london
as
they
are
in
timbuctoo
why
i
saw
an
plant
put
up
in
a
western
town
in
three
days
once
there
were
over
a
hundred
burners
in
one
saloon
and
the
engineer
who
put
them
up
told
me
in
confidence
that
what
the
chief
engineer
told
him
in
confidence
was
never
disclosed
for
at
that
moment
miss
morris
interrupted
him
with
a
sudden
sharp
exclamation
oh
carlton
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
listen
to
this
she
had
been
reading
one
of
the
dozen
papers
which
carlton
had
purchased
at
the
station
and
was
now
shaking
one
of
them
at
him
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
open
page
my
dear
edith
remonstrated
her
aunt
carlton
was
telling
us
yes
i
know
exclaimed
miss
morris
laughing
but
this
interests
him
much
more
than
electric
lights
who
do
you
think
is
in
london
she
cried
raising
her
eyes
to
his
and
pausing
for
proper
dramatic
effect
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
no
shouted
carlton
yes
miss
morris
answered
mocking
his
tone
listen
em
e
m
her
right
was
the
princess
of
wales
em
oh
i
ca
find
it
no
yes
here
it
is
to
her
stood
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
she
wore
a
dress
of
white
silk
with
train
of
silver
brocade
trimmed
with
fur
ornaments
emeralds
and
diamonds
orders
victoria
and
albert
jubilee
commemoration
medal
coburg
and
gotha
and
hohenwald
and
grasse
by
jove
cried
carlton
excitedly
i
say
is
that
really
there
let
me
see
it
please
for
myself
miss
morris
handed
him
the
paper
with
her
finger
on
the
paragraph
and
picking
up
another
began
a
search
down
its
columns
you
are
right
exclaimed
carlton
solemnly
it
she
sure
enough
and
here
i
been
within
two
hours
of
her
and
did
know
it
miss
morris
gave
another
triumphant
cry
as
though
she
had
discovered
a
vein
of
gold
yes
and
here
she
is
again
she
said
in
the
gentlewoman
queen
dress
was
of
black
as
usual
but
relieved
by
a
few
violet
ribbons
in
the
bonnet
and
princess
beatrice
who
sat
by
her
side
showed
but
little
trace
of
the
anxiety
caused
by
princess
accident
princess
aline
on
the
front
seat
in
a
light
brown
jacket
and
a
becoming
bonnet
gave
the
necessary
touch
to
a
picture
which
londoners
would
be
glad
to
look
upon
more
often
carlton
sat
staring
forward
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
with
his
eyes
open
wide
from
excitement
he
presented
so
unusual
an
appearance
of
bewilderment
and
delight
that
downs
looked
at
him
and
at
her
niece
for
some
explanation
the
young
lady
seems
to
interest
you
said
she
tentatively
she
is
the
most
charming
creature
in
the
world
downs
cried
carlton
and
i
was
going
all
the
way
to
grasse
to
see
her
and
now
it
turns
out
that
she
is
here
in
england
within
a
few
miles
of
us
he
turned
and
waved
his
hands
at
the
passing
landscape
every
minute
brings
us
nearer
together
and
you
did
feel
it
in
the
air
mocked
miss
morris
laughing
you
are
a
pretty
poor
sort
of
a
man
to
let
a
girl
tell
you
where
to
find
the
woman
you
love
carlton
did
not
answer
but
stared
at
her
very
seriously
and
frowned
intently
now
i
have
got
to
begin
all
over
again
and
readjust
things
he
said
we
might
have
guessed
she
would
be
in
london
on
account
of
this
royal
wedding
it
is
a
great
pity
it
is
later
in
the
season
when
there
would
be
more
things
going
on
and
more
chances
of
meeting
her
now
they
will
all
be
interested
in
themselves
and
being
extremely
exclusive
no
one
who
is
a
cousin
to
the
bridegroom
or
an
emperor
would
have
any
chance
at
all
still
i
can
see
her
i
can
look
at
her
and
that
something
it
is
better
than
a
photograph
anyway
said
miss
morris
they
will
be
either
at
buckingham
palace
or
at
windsor
or
they
will
stop
at
brown
said
carlton
all
royalties
go
to
brown
i
know
why
unless
it
is
because
it
is
so
expensive
or
maybe
it
is
expensive
because
royalties
go
there
but
in
any
event
if
they
are
not
at
the
palace
that
is
where
they
will
be
and
that
is
where
i
shall
have
to
go
too
when
the
train
drew
up
at
victoria
station
carlton
directed
nolan
to
take
his
things
to
brown
hotel
but
not
to
unload
them
until
he
had
arrived
then
he
drove
with
the
ladies
to
cox
and
saw
them
settled
there
he
promised
to
return
at
once
to
dine
and
to
tell
them
what
he
had
discovered
in
his
absence
you
got
to
help
me
in
this
miss
morris
he
said
nervously
i
am
beginning
to
feel
that
i
am
not
worthy
of
her
oh
yes
you
are
she
said
laughing
but
do
forget
that
not
the
lover
who
comes
to
woo
but
the
lover
way
of
wooing
and
that
heart
and
the
rest
of
it
yes
i
know
said
carlton
doubtfully
but
it
a
bit
sudden
it
oh
i
am
ashamed
of
you
you
are
frightened
no
not
frightened
exactly
said
the
painter
i
think
it
just
natural
emotion
as
carlton
turned
into
albemarle
street
he
noticed
a
red
carpet
stretching
from
the
doorway
of
brown
hotel
out
across
the
sidewalk
to
a
carriage
and
a
bareheaded
man
bustling
about
apparently
assisting
several
gentlemen
to
get
into
it
this
and
another
carriage
and
nolan
blocked
the
way
but
without
waiting
for
them
to
move
up
carlton
leaned
out
of
his
hansom
and
called
the
bareheaded
man
to
its
side
is
the
duke
of
hohenwald
stopping
at
your
hotel
he
asked
the
bareheaded
man
answered
that
he
was
all
right
nolan
cried
carlton
they
can
take
in
the
trunks
hearing
this
the
bareheaded
man
hastened
to
help
carlton
to
alight
that
was
the
duke
who
just
drove
off
sir
and
those
he
said
pointing
to
three
muffled
figures
who
were
stepping
into
a
second
carriage
are
his
sisters
the
princesses
carlton
stopped
midway
with
one
foot
on
the
step
and
the
other
in
the
air
the
deuce
they
are
he
exclaimed
and
which
is
he
began
eagerly
and
then
remembering
himself
dropped
back
on
the
cushions
of
the
hansom
he
broke
into
the
little
at
cox
in
so
excited
a
state
that
two
dignified
old
gentlemen
who
were
eating
there
sat
in
astonished
disapproval
downs
and
miss
morris
had
just
come
down
stairs
i
have
seen
her
carlton
cried
ecstatically
only
half
an
hour
in
the
town
and
i
seen
her
already
no
really
exclaimed
miss
morris
and
how
did
she
look
is
she
as
beautiful
as
you
expected
well
i
ca
tell
yet
carlton
answered
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
were
all
muffled
up
and
which
one
of
the
three
she
was
i
do
know
she
was
labelled
as
in
the
picture
but
she
was
there
and
i
saw
her
the
woman
i
love
was
one
of
that
three
and
i
have
engaged
rooms
at
the
hotel
and
this
very
night
the
same
roof
shelters
us
both
ii
the
course
of
true
love
certainly
runs
smoothly
with
you
said
miss
morris
as
they
seated
themselves
at
the
table
what
is
your
next
move
what
do
you
mean
to
do
now
the
rest
is
very
simple
said
carlton
morning
i
will
go
to
the
row
i
will
be
sure
to
find
some
one
there
who
knows
all
about
them
where
they
are
going
and
who
they
are
seeing
and
what
engagements
they
may
have
then
it
will
only
be
a
matter
of
looking
up
some
friend
in
the
household
or
in
one
of
the
embassies
who
can
present
me
oh
said
miss
morris
in
the
tone
of
keenest
disappointment
but
that
is
such
a
commonplace
ending
you
started
out
so
romantically
could
you
manage
to
meet
her
in
a
less
conventional
way
i
am
afraid
not
said
carlton
you
see
i
want
to
meet
her
very
much
and
to
meet
her
very
soon
and
the
quickest
way
of
meeting
her
whether
it
romantic
or
not
is
a
bit
too
quick
for
me
there
will
be
romance
enough
after
i
am
presented
if
i
have
my
way
but
carlton
was
not
to
have
his
way
for
he
had
overlooked
the
fact
that
it
requires
as
many
to
make
an
introduction
as
a
bargain
and
he
had
left
the
duke
of
hohenwald
out
of
his
considerations
he
met
many
people
he
knew
in
the
row
the
next
morning
they
asked
him
to
lunch
and
brought
their
horses
up
to
the
rail
and
he
patted
the
heads
and
led
the
conversation
around
to
the
royal
wedding
and
through
it
to
the
hohenwalds
he
learned
that
they
had
attended
a
reception
at
the
german
embassy
on
the
previous
night
and
it
was
one
of
the
secretaries
of
that
embassy
who
informed
him
of
their
intended
departure
that
morning
on
the
eleven
train
to
paris
to
paris
cried
carlton
in
consternation
what
all
of
them
yes
all
of
them
of
course
why
asked
the
young
german
but
carlton
was
already
dodging
across
the
to
piccadilly
and
waving
his
stick
at
a
hansom
nolan
met
him
at
the
door
of
brown
hotel
with
an
anxious
countenance
their
royal
highnesses
have
gone
sir
he
said
but
i
packed
your
trunks
and
sent
them
to
the
station
shall
i
follow
them
sir
yes
said
carlton
follow
the
trunks
and
follow
the
hohenwalds
i
will
come
over
on
the
club
train
at
four
meet
me
at
the
station
and
tell
me
to
what
hotel
they
have
gone
wait
if
i
miss
you
you
can
find
me
at
the
hotel
continental
but
if
they
go
straight
on
through
paris
you
go
with
them
and
telegraph
me
here
and
to
the
continental
telegraph
at
every
station
so
i
can
keep
track
of
you
have
you
enough
money
i
have
sir
enough
for
a
long
trip
sir
well
you
need
it
said
carlton
grimly
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
trip
it
is
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
now
you
will
have
to
hurry
have
you
paid
my
bill
here
i
have
sir
said
nolan
then
get
off
and
do
lose
sight
of
those
people
again
carlton
attended
to
several
matters
of
business
and
then
lunched
with
downs
and
her
niece
he
had
grown
to
like
them
very
much
and
was
sorry
to
lose
sight
of
them
but
consoled
himself
by
thinking
he
would
see
them
a
few
days
at
least
in
paris
he
judged
that
he
would
be
there
for
some
time
as
he
did
not
think
the
princess
aline
and
her
sisters
would
pass
through
that
city
without
stopping
to
visit
the
shops
on
the
rue
de
la
paix
all
women
are
not
princesses
he
argued
but
all
princesses
are
women
we
will
be
in
paris
on
wednesday
downs
told
him
the
orient
express
leaves
there
twice
a
week
on
mondays
and
thursdays
and
we
have
taken
an
apartment
for
next
thursday
and
will
go
right
on
to
constantinople
but
i
thought
you
said
you
had
to
buy
a
lot
of
clothes
there
carlton
expostulated
downs
said
that
they
would
do
that
on
their
way
home
nolan
met
carlton
at
the
station
and
told
him
that
he
had
followed
the
hohenwalds
to
the
hotel
meurice
there
is
the
duke
sir
and
the
three
princesses
nolan
said
and
there
are
two
german
gentlemen
acting
as
equerries
and
an
english
captain
a
sort
of
to
the
duke
and
two
elderly
ladies
and
eight
servants
they
travel
very
simple
sir
and
their
people
are
in
undress
livery
brown
and
red
sir
carlton
pretended
not
to
listen
to
this
he
had
begun
to
doubt
but
that
nolan
zeal
would
lead
him
into
some
indiscretion
and
would
end
disastrously
to
himself
he
spent
the
evening
alone
in
front
of
the
cafe
de
la
paix
pleasantly
occupied
in
watching
the
life
and
movement
of
that
great
meeting
of
the
highways
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
he
had
ever
been
away
it
was
as
though
he
had
picked
up
a
book
and
opened
it
at
the
page
and
place
at
which
he
had
left
off
reading
it
a
moment
before
there
was
the
same
type
the
same
plot
and
the
same
characters
who
were
doing
the
same
characteristic
things
even
the
waiter
who
tipped
out
his
coffee
knew
him
and
he
knew
or
felt
as
though
he
knew
half
of
those
who
passed
or
who
shared
with
him
the
half
of
the
sidewalk
the
women
at
the
next
table
considered
the
slim
young
american
with
friendly
curiosity
and
the
men
with
them
discussed
him
in
french
until
a
parisian
recognized
carlton
in
passing
and
hailed
him
joyously
in
the
same
language
at
which
the
women
laughed
and
the
men
looked
sheepishly
conscious
on
the
following
morning
carlton
took
up
his
post
in
the
open
court
of
the
meurice
with
his
coffee
and
the
figaro
to
excuse
his
loitering
there
he
had
not
been
occupied
with
these
before
nolan
approached
him
in
some
excitement
with
the
information
that
their
royal
highnesses
as
he
delighted
to
call
them
were
at
that
moment
coming
down
the
lift
carlton
could
hear
their
voices
and
wished
to
step
around
the
corner
and
see
them
it
was
for
this
chance
he
had
been
waiting
but
he
could
not
afford
to
act
in
so
undignified
a
manner
before
nolan
so
he
merely
crossed
his
legs
nervously
and
told
the
servant
to
go
back
to
the
rooms
confound
him
he
said
i
wish
he
would
let
me
conduct
my
own
affairs
in
my
own
way
if
i
do
stop
him
he
carry
the
princess
aline
off
by
force
and
send
me
word
where
he
has
hidden
her
the
hohenwalds
had
evidently
departed
for
a
day
outing
as
up
to
five
they
had
not
returned
and
carlton
after
loitering
all
the
afternoon
gave
up
waiting
for
them
and
went
out
to
dine
at
laurent
in
the
champs
elysees
he
had
finished
his
dinner
and
was
leaning
luxuriously
forward
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
knocking
the
cigar
ashes
into
his
he
was
pleasantly
content
the
trees
hung
heavy
with
leaves
over
his
head
a
fountain
played
and
overflowed
at
his
elbow
and
the
lamps
of
the
fiacres
passing
and
repassing
on
the
avenue
of
the
champs
elysees
shone
like
giant
through
the
foliage
the
touch
of
the
gravel
beneath
his
feet
emphasized
the
free
charm
of
the
place
and
the
faces
of
the
others
around
him
looked
more
than
usually
cheerful
in
the
light
of
the
candles
flickering
under
the
clouded
shades
his
mind
had
gone
back
to
his
earlier
student
days
in
paris
when
life
always
looked
as
it
did
now
in
the
brief
of
satisfaction
which
followed
a
cold
bath
or
a
good
dinner
and
he
had
forgotten
himself
and
his
surroundings
it
was
the
voices
of
the
people
at
the
table
behind
him
that
brought
him
back
to
the
present
moment
a
man
was
talking
he
spoke
in
english
with
an
accent
i
should
like
to
go
again
through
the
luxembourg
he
said
but
you
need
not
be
bound
by
what
i
do
i
think
it
would
be
pleasanter
if
we
all
keep
together
said
a
voice
quietly
she
also
spoke
in
english
and
with
the
same
accent
the
people
whose
voices
had
interrupted
him
were
sitting
and
standing
around
a
long
table
which
the
waiters
had
made
large
enough
for
their
party
by
placing
three
of
the
smaller
ones
side
by
side
they
had
finished
their
dinner
and
the
women
who
sat
with
their
backs
towards
carlton
were
pulling
on
their
gloves
which
is
it
to
be
then
said
the
gentleman
smiling
the
pictures
or
the
dressmakers
the
girl
who
had
first
spoken
turned
to
the
one
next
to
her
which
would
you
rather
do
aline
she
asked
carlton
moved
so
suddenly
that
the
men
behind
him
looked
at
him
curiously
but
he
turned
nevertheless
in
his
chair
and
faced
them
and
in
order
to
excuse
his
doing
so
beckoned
to
one
of
the
waiters
he
was
within
two
feet
of
the
girl
who
had
been
called
aline
she
raised
her
head
to
speak
and
saw
carlton
staring
at
her
she
glanced
at
him
for
an
instant
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
she
did
not
know
him
and
then
turning
to
her
brother
smiled
in
the
same
tolerant
amused
way
in
which
she
had
so
often
smiled
upon
carlton
from
the
picture
i
am
afraid
i
had
rather
go
to
the
bon
march
she
said
one
of
the
waiters
stepped
in
between
them
and
carlton
asked
him
for
his
bill
but
when
it
came
he
left
it
lying
on
the
plate
and
sat
staring
out
into
the
night
between
the
candles
puffing
sharply
on
his
cigar
and
recalling
to
his
memory
his
first
sight
of
the
princess
aline
of
hohenwald
that
night
as
he
turned
into
bed
he
gave
a
comfortable
sigh
of
content
i
am
glad
she
chose
the
dressmakers
instead
of
the
pictures
he
said
downs
and
miss
morris
arrived
in
paris
on
wednesday
and
expressed
their
anxiety
to
have
carlton
lunch
with
them
and
to
hear
him
tell
of
the
progress
of
his
there
was
not
much
to
tell
the
hohenwalds
had
come
and
gone
from
the
hotel
as
freely
as
any
other
tourists
in
paris
but
the
very
lack
of
ceremony
about
their
movements
was
in
itself
a
difficulty
the
manner
of
acquaintance
he
could
make
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
meurice
with
one
of
the
men
over
a
cup
of
coffee
or
a
glass
of
bock
would
be
as
readily
discontinued
as
begun
and
for
his
purpose
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
the
hohenwalds
had
been
living
in
state
with
a
visitors
book
and
a
chamberlain
on
wednesday
evening
carlton
took
the
ladies
to
the
opera
where
the
hohenwalds
occupied
a
box
immediately
opposite
them
carlton
pretended
to
be
surprised
at
this
fact
but
downs
doubted
his
sincerity
i
saw
nolan
talking
to
their
courier
she
said
and
i
fancy
he
asked
a
few
leading
questions
well
he
did
learn
much
if
he
did
he
said
the
fellow
only
talks
german
ah
then
he
has
been
asking
questions
said
miss
morris
well
he
does
it
on
his
own
responsibility
said
carlton
for
i
told
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
servants
he
has
too
much
zeal
has
nolan
i
afraid
of
him
if
you
were
only
half
as
interested
as
he
is
said
miss
morris
you
would
have
known
her
long
ago
long
ago
exclaimed
carlton
i
only
saw
her
four
days
since
she
is
certainly
very
beautiful
said
miss
morris
looking
across
the
auditorium
but
she
is
there
said
carlton
that
the
eldest
sister
the
two
other
sisters
went
out
on
the
coach
this
morning
to
versailles
and
were
too
tired
to
come
tonight
at
least
so
nolan
says
he
seems
to
have
established
a
friendship
for
their
english
maid
but
whether
it
on
my
account
or
his
own
i
know
i
doubt
his
unselfishness
how
disappointing
of
her
said
miss
morris
and
after
you
had
selected
a
box
just
across
the
way
too
it
is
such
a
pity
to
waste
it
on
us
carlton
smiled
and
looked
up
at
her
impudently
as
though
he
meant
to
say
something
but
remembering
that
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
changed
his
mind
and
lowered
his
eyes
to
his
programme
why
did
you
say
it
asked
miss
morris
calmly
turning
her
glass
to
the
stage
was
it
pretty
no
said
carlton
not
pretty
enough
the
ladies
left
the
hotel
the
next
day
to
take
the
orient
express
which
left
paris
at
six
they
had
bidden
carlton
goodbye
at
four
the
same
afternoon
and
as
he
had
come
to
their
rooms
for
that
purpose
they
were
in
consequence
a
little
surprised
to
see
him
at
the
station
running
wildly
along
the
platform
followed
by
nolan
and
a
porter
he
came
into
their
compartment
after
the
train
had
started
and
shook
his
head
sadly
at
them
from
the
door
well
what
do
you
think
of
this
he
said
you
ca
get
rid
of
me
you
see
i
going
with
you
going
with
us
asked
downs
how
far
carlton
laughed
and
coming
inside
dropped
onto
the
cushions
with
a
sigh
i
do
know
he
said
dejectedly
all
the
way
i
afraid
that
is
i
mean
i
very
glad
i
am
to
have
your
society
for
a
few
days
more
but
really
i
did
bargain
for
this
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
they
are
on
this
train
said
miss
morris
they
are
said
carlton
they
have
a
car
to
themselves
at
the
rear
they
only
made
up
their
minds
to
go
this
morning
and
they
nearly
succeeded
in
giving
me
the
slip
again
but
it
seems
that
their
english
maid
stopped
nolan
in
the
hall
to
bid
him
and
so
he
found
out
their
plans
they
are
going
direct
to
constantinople
and
then
to
athens
they
had
meant
to
stay
in
paris
two
weeks
longer
it
seems
but
they
changed
their
minds
last
night
it
was
a
very
close
shave
for
me
i
only
got
back
to
the
hotel
in
time
to
hear
from
the
concierge
that
nolan
had
flown
with
all
of
my
things
and
left
word
for
me
to
follow
just
fancy
suppose
i
had
missed
the
train
and
had
had
to
chase
him
clear
across
the
continent
of
europe
with
not
even
a
razor
i
am
glad
said
miss
morris
that
nolan
has
not
taken
a
fancy
to
me
i
doubt
if
i
could
resist
such
impetuosity
the
orient
express
in
which
carlton
and
the
mistress
of
his
heart
and
fancy
were
speeding
towards
the
horizon
utmost
purple
rim
was
made
up
of
six
cars
one
with
a
attached
and
five
including
the
one
reserved
for
the
duke
of
hohenwald
and
his
suite
these
cars
were
lightly
built
and
rocked
in
consequence
and
the
dust
raised
by
the
rapid
movement
of
the
train
swept
through
cracks
and
open
windows
and
sprinkled
the
passengers
with
a
fine
and
irritating
coating
of
soot
and
earth
there
was
one
servant
to
the
entire
passengers
he
spoke
eight
languages
and
never
slept
but
as
his
services
were
in
demand
by
several
people
in
as
many
different
cars
at
the
same
moment
he
satisfied
no
one
and
the
in
the
was
stuffed
full
to
the
slot
in
consequence
before
they
had
crossed
the
borders
of
france
carlton
and
miss
morris
went
out
upon
one
of
the
platforms
and
sat
down
upon
a
it
is
as
comfortable
here
as
in
an
at
home
said
carlton
but
it
just
as
noisy
he
pointed
out
to
her
from
time
to
time
the
peasants
gathering
twigs
and
the
gendarmes
guarding
the
woods
and
the
fences
skirting
them
nothing
is
allowed
to
go
to
waste
in
this
country
he
said
it
looks
as
though
they
went
over
it
once
a
month
with
a
and
a
i
believe
they
number
the
trees
as
we
number
the
houses
and
did
you
notice
the
great
fortifications
covered
with
grass
she
said
we
have
passed
such
a
lot
of
them
carlton
nodded
and
did
you
notice
that
they
all
faced
only
one
way
carlton
laughed
and
nodded
again
towards
germany
he
said
by
the
next
day
they
had
left
the
tall
poplars
and
white
roads
behind
them
and
were
crossing
the
land
of
low
shiny
black
helmets
and
brass
spikes
they
had
come
into
a
country
of
low
mountains
and
black
forests
with
old
fortified
castles
topping
the
hills
and
with
villages
scattered
around
the
base
how
very
military
it
all
is
downs
said
even
the
men
at
the
lonely
little
stations
in
the
forests
wear
uniforms
and
do
you
notice
how
each
of
them
rolls
up
his
red
flag
and
holds
it
like
a
sword
and
salutes
the
train
as
it
passes
they
spent
the
hour
during
which
the
train
shifted
from
one
station
in
vienna
to
the
other
driving
about
in
an
open
carriage
and
stopped
for
a
few
moments
in
front
of
a
cafe
to
drink
beer
and
to
feel
solid
earth
under
them
again
returning
to
the
train
with
a
feeling
which
was
almost
that
of
getting
back
to
their
own
rooms
then
they
came
to
great
steppes
covered
with
long
thick
grass
and
flooded
in
places
with
little
lakes
of
broken
ice
great
horned
cattle
stood
in
this
grass
and
at
the
villages
and
were
people
wearing
sheepskin
jackets
and
waistcoats
covered
with
silver
buttons
in
one
place
there
was
a
wedding
procession
waiting
for
the
train
to
pass
with
the
friends
of
the
bride
and
groom
in
their
best
clothes
the
women
with
silver
breastplates
and
boots
to
their
knees
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
only
two
days
before
they
had
seen
another
wedding
party
in
the
champs
elysees
where
the
men
wore
evening
dress
and
the
women
were
bareheaded
and
with
long
trains
in
hours
they
had
passed
through
republics
principalities
empires
and
kingdoms
and
from
spring
to
winter
it
was
like
walking
rapidly
over
a
painted
panorama
of
europe
on
the
second
evening
carlton
went
off
into
the
alone
the
duke
of
hohenwald
and
two
of
his
friends
had
finished
a
late
supper
and
were
seated
in
the
apartment
adjoining
it
the
duke
was
a
young
man
with
a
heavy
beard
and
eyeglasses
he
was
looking
over
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
the
salon
and
as
carlton
dropped
on
the
sofa
opposite
the
duke
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
him
curiously
and
then
turned
over
several
pages
of
the
catalogue
and
studied
one
of
them
and
then
back
at
carlton
as
though
he
were
comparing
him
with
something
on
the
page
before
him
carlton
was
looking
out
at
the
night
but
he
could
follow
what
was
going
forward
as
it
was
reflected
in
the
glass
of
the
car
window
he
saw
the
duke
hand
the
catalogue
to
one
of
the
equerries
who
raised
his
eyebrows
and
nodded
his
head
in
assent
carlton
wondered
what
this
might
mean
until
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
portrait
of
himself
by
a
french
artist
in
the
salon
and
concluded
it
had
been
reproduced
in
the
catalogue
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
which
would
explain
the
interest
the
two
men
showed
in
him
on
the
morning
following
he
sent
nolan
out
to
purchase
a
catalogue
at
the
first
station
at
which
they
stopped
and
found
that
his
guess
was
a
correct
one
a
portrait
of
himself
had
been
reproduced
in
black
and
white
with
his
name
below
it
well
they
know
who
i
am
now
he
said
to
miss
morris
even
if
they
do
know
me
that
honor
is
still
in
store
for
them
i
wish
they
did
not
lock
themselves
up
so
tightly
said
miss
morris
i
want
to
see
her
very
much
can
not
we
walk
up
and
down
the
platform
at
the
next
station
she
may
be
at
the
window
of
course
said
carlton
you
could
have
seen
her
at
if
you
had
spoken
of
it
she
was
walking
up
and
down
then
the
next
time
the
train
stops
we
will
prowl
up
and
down
and
feast
our
eyes
upon
her
but
miss
morris
had
her
wish
gratified
without
that
exertion
the
hohenwalds
were
served
in
the
after
the
other
passengers
had
finished
and
were
in
consequence
only
to
be
seen
when
they
passed
by
the
doors
of
the
other
compartments
but
this
same
morning
after
luncheon
the
three
princesses
instead
of
returning
to
their
own
car
seated
themselves
in
the
compartment
adjoining
the
while
the
men
of
their
party
lit
their
cigars
and
sat
in
a
circle
around
them
i
was
wondering
how
long
they
could
stand
three
men
smoking
in
one
of
the
boxes
they
call
cars
said
downs
she
was
seated
between
miss
morris
and
carlton
directly
opposite
the
hohenwalds
and
so
near
them
that
she
had
to
speak
in
a
whisper
to
avoid
doing
this
miss
morris
asked
carlton
for
a
pencil
and
scribbled
with
it
in
the
novel
she
held
on
her
lap
then
she
passed
them
both
back
to
him
and
said
aloud
have
you
read
this
it
has
such
a
pretty
dedication
the
dedication
read
which
is
aline
and
carlton
taking
the
pencil
in
his
turn
made
a
rapid
sketch
of
her
on
the
and
wrote
beneath
it
this
is
she
do
you
wonder
i
travelled
four
thousand
miles
to
see
her
miss
morris
took
the
book
again
and
glanced
at
the
sketch
and
then
at
the
three
princesses
and
nodded
her
head
it
is
very
beautiful
she
said
gravely
looking
out
at
the
passing
landscape
well
not
beautiful
exactly
answered
carlton
surveying
the
hills
critically
but
certainly
very
attractive
it
is
worth
travelling
a
long
way
to
see
and
i
should
think
one
would
grow
very
fond
of
it
miss
morris
tore
the
out
of
the
book
and
slipped
it
between
the
pages
may
i
keep
it
she
said
carlton
nodded
and
will
you
sign
it
she
asked
smiling
carlton
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
laughed
if
you
wish
it
he
answered
the
princess
wore
a
gray
cheviot
travelling
dress
as
did
her
sisters
and
a
gray
alpine
hat
she
was
leaning
back
talking
to
the
english
captain
who
accompanied
them
and
laughing
carlton
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
who
appealed
so
strongly
to
every
taste
of
which
he
was
possessed
she
seemed
so
sure
of
herself
so
alert
and
yet
so
gracious
so
easily
entertained
and
yet
when
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
the
strange
dismal
landscape
so
seriously
intent
upon
its
sad
beauty
the
english
captain
dropped
his
head
and
with
the
pretence
of
pulling
at
his
mustache
covered
his
mouth
as
he
spoke
to
her
when
he
had
finished
he
gazed
consciously
at
the
roof
of
the
car
and
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
steadily
at
the
object
towards
which
they
had
turned
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
and
then
after
a
decent
pause
turned
her
eyes
as
carlton
knew
she
would
towards
him
he
was
telling
her
who
i
am
he
thought
and
about
the
picture
in
the
catalogue
in
a
few
moments
she
turned
to
her
sister
and
spoke
to
her
pointing
out
at
something
in
the
scenery
and
the
same
pantomime
was
repeated
and
again
with
the
third
sister
did
you
see
those
girls
talking
about
you
mr
carlton
miss
morris
asked
after
they
had
left
the
car
carlton
said
it
looked
as
though
they
were
of
course
they
were
said
miss
morris
that
englishman
told
the
princess
aline
something
about
you
and
then
she
told
her
sister
and
she
told
the
eldest
one
it
would
be
nice
if
they
inherit
their
father
interest
in
painting
would
it
i
would
rather
have
it
degenerate
into
an
interest
in
painters
myself
said
carlton
miss
morris
discovered
after
she
had
returned
to
her
own
car
that
she
had
left
the
novel
where
she
had
been
sitting
and
carlton
sent
nolan
back
for
it
it
had
slipped
to
the
floor
and
the
upon
which
carlton
had
sketched
the
princess
aline
was
lying
face
down
beside
it
nolan
picked
up
the
leaf
and
saw
the
picture
and
read
the
inscription
below
this
is
she
do
you
wonder
i
travelled
four
thousand
miles
to
see
her
he
handed
the
book
to
miss
morris
and
was
backing
out
of
the
compartment
when
she
stopped
him
there
was
a
loose
page
in
this
nolan
she
said
it
gone
did
you
see
it
a
loose
page
miss
said
nolan
with
some
concern
oh
yes
miss
i
was
going
to
tell
you
there
was
a
scrap
of
paper
blew
away
when
i
was
passing
between
the
carriages
was
it
something
you
wanted
miss
something
i
wanted
exclaimed
miss
morris
in
dismay
carlton
laughed
easily
it
is
just
as
well
i
did
sign
it
after
all
he
said
i
do
want
to
proclaim
my
devotion
to
any
hungarian
gypsy
who
happens
to
read
english
you
must
draw
me
another
as
a
souvenir
miss
morris
said
nolan
continued
on
through
the
length
of
the
car
until
he
had
reached
the
one
occupied
by
the
hohenwalds
where
he
waited
on
the
platform
until
the
english
maidservant
saw
him
and
came
to
the
door
of
the
carriage
what
hotel
are
your
people
going
to
stop
at
in
constantinople
nolan
asked
the
i
think
she
answered
that
right
said
nolan
approvingly
that
the
one
we
are
going
to
i
thought
i
would
come
and
tell
you
about
it
and
he
said
here
a
picture
somebody
made
of
your
princess
aline
she
dropped
it
and
i
picked
it
up
you
had
better
give
it
back
to
her
well
he
added
politely
i
glad
you
are
coming
to
our
hotel
in
constantinople
it
pleasant
having
some
one
to
talk
to
who
can
speak
your
own
tongue
the
girl
returned
to
the
car
and
left
nolan
alone
upon
the
platform
he
exhaled
a
long
breath
of
suppressed
excitement
and
then
gazed
around
nervously
upon
the
empty
landscape
i
fancy
that
going
to
hurry
things
up
a
bit
he
murmured
with
an
anxious
smile
he
never
get
along
at
all
if
it
was
for
me
for
reasons
possibly
best
understood
by
the
german
ambassador
the
state
of
the
hohenwalds
at
constantinople
differed
greatly
from
that
which
had
obtained
at
the
french
capital
they
no
longer
came
and
went
as
they
wished
or
wandered
through
the
of
the
city
like
ordinary
tourists
there
was
on
the
contrary
not
only
a
change
in
their
manner
towards
others
but
there
was
an
insistence
on
their
part
of
a
difference
in
the
attitude
of
others
towards
themselves
this
showed
itself
in
the
reserving
of
the
half
of
the
hotel
for
their
use
and
in
the
haughty
bearing
of
the
equerries
who
appeared
unexpectedly
in
magnificent
uniforms
the
visitors
book
was
covered
with
the
autographs
of
all
of
the
important
people
in
the
turkish
capital
and
the
sultan
carriages
stood
constantly
before
the
door
of
the
hotel
awaiting
their
pleasure
until
they
became
as
familiar
a
sight
as
the
street
dogs
or
as
cabs
in
a
rank
and
in
following
out
the
programme
which
had
been
laid
down
for
her
the
princess
aline
became
even
less
accessible
to
carlton
than
before
and
he
grew
desperate
and
despondent
if
the
worst
comes
he
said
to
miss
morris
i
shall
tell
nolan
to
give
an
alarm
of
fire
some
night
and
then
i
will
run
in
and
rescue
her
before
they
find
out
there
is
no
fire
or
he
might
frighten
the
horses
some
day
and
give
me
a
chance
to
stop
them
we
might
even
wait
until
we
reach
greece
and
have
her
carried
off
by
brigands
who
would
only
give
her
up
to
me
there
are
no
more
brigands
in
greece
said
miss
morris
and
besides
why
do
you
suppose
they
would
only
give
her
up
to
you
because
they
would
be
imitation
brigands
said
carlton
and
would
be
paid
to
give
her
up
to
no
one
else
oh
you
plan
very
well
scoffed
miss
morris
but
you
do
do
anything
carlton
was
saved
the
necessity
of
doing
anything
that
same
morning
when
the
english
captain
in
attendance
on
the
duke
sent
his
card
to
carlton
room
he
came
he
explained
to
present
the
compliments
and
would
it
be
convenient
for
carlton
to
meet
the
duke
that
afternoon
carlton
suppressed
an
unseemly
desire
to
shout
and
said
after
a
moment
consideration
that
it
would
he
then
took
the
english
captain
down
stairs
to
the
and
rewarded
him
for
his
agreeable
message
the
duke
received
carlton
in
the
afternoon
and
greeted
him
most
cordially
and
with
as
much
ease
of
manner
as
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
possess
who
has
never
enjoyed
the
benefits
of
meeting
other
men
on
an
equal
footing
he
expressed
his
pleasure
in
knowing
an
artist
with
whose
work
he
was
so
familiar
and
congratulated
himself
on
the
happy
accident
which
had
brought
them
both
to
the
same
hotel
i
have
more
than
a
natural
interest
in
meeting
you
said
the
prince
and
for
a
reason
which
you
may
or
may
not
know
i
thought
possibly
you
could
help
me
somewhat
i
have
within
the
past
few
days
come
into
the
possession
of
two
of
your
paintings
they
are
studies
rather
but
to
me
they
are
even
more
desirable
than
the
finished
work
and
i
am
not
correct
in
saying
that
they
have
come
to
me
exactly
but
to
my
sister
the
princess
aline
carlton
could
not
withhold
a
certain
start
of
surprise
he
had
not
expected
that
his
gift
would
so
soon
have
arrived
but
his
face
showed
only
polite
attention
the
studies
were
delivered
to
us
in
london
continued
the
duke
they
are
of
ludwig
the
tragedian
and
of
the
german
prime
minister
two
most
valuable
works
and
especially
interesting
to
us
they
came
without
any
note
or
message
which
would
inform
us
who
had
sent
them
and
when
my
people
made
inquiries
the
dealer
refused
to
tell
them
from
whom
they
had
come
he
had
been
ordered
to
forward
them
to
grasse
but
on
learning
of
our
presence
in
london
sent
them
direct
to
our
hotel
there
of
course
it
is
embarrassing
to
have
so
valuable
a
present
from
an
anonymous
friend
especially
so
for
my
sister
to
whom
they
were
addressed
and
i
thought
that
besides
the
pleasure
of
meeting
one
of
whose
genius
i
am
so
warm
an
admirer
i
might
also
learn
something
which
would
enable
me
to
discover
who
our
friend
may
be
he
paused
but
as
carlton
said
nothing
continued
as
it
is
now
i
do
not
feel
that
i
can
accept
the
pictures
and
yet
i
know
no
one
to
whom
they
can
be
returned
unless
i
send
them
to
the
dealer
it
sounds
very
mysterious
said
carlton
smiling
and
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
help
you
what
work
i
did
in
germany
was
sold
in
berlin
before
i
left
and
in
a
year
may
have
changed
hands
several
times
the
studies
of
which
you
speak
are
unimportant
and
merely
studies
and
could
pass
from
hand
to
hand
without
much
record
having
been
kept
of
them
but
personally
i
am
not
able
to
give
you
any
information
which
would
assist
you
in
tracing
them
yes
said
the
duke
well
then
i
shall
keep
them
until
i
can
learn
more
and
if
we
can
learn
nothing
i
shall
return
them
to
the
dealer
carlton
met
miss
morris
that
afternoon
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
it
come
he
cried
it
come
i
am
to
meet
her
this
week
i
have
met
her
brother
and
he
has
asked
me
to
dine
with
them
on
thursday
night
that
the
day
before
they
leave
for
athens
and
he
particularly
mentioned
that
his
sisters
would
be
at
the
dinner
and
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
present
me
it
seems
that
the
eldest
paints
and
all
of
them
love
art
for
art
sake
as
their
father
taught
them
to
do
and
for
all
we
know
he
may
make
me
court
painter
and
i
shall
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
at
grasse
painting
portraits
of
the
princess
aline
at
the
age
of
and
at
all
future
ages
and
if
he
does
give
me
a
commission
to
paint
her
i
can
tell
you
now
in
confidence
that
that
picture
will
require
more
sittings
than
any
other
picture
ever
painted
by
man
her
hair
will
have
turned
white
by
the
time
it
is
finished
and
the
gown
she
started
to
pose
in
will
have
become
forty
years
behind
the
fashion
on
the
morning
following
carlton
and
downs
and
her
niece
with
all
the
tourists
in
constantinople
were
placed
in
open
carriages
by
their
dragomans
and
driven
in
a
long
procession
to
the
seraglio
to
see
the
sultan
treasures
those
of
them
who
had
waited
two
weeks
for
this
chance
looked
aggrieved
at
the
more
fortunate
who
had
come
at
the
eleventh
hour
on
the
last
night
steamer
and
seemed
to
think
these
latter
had
attained
the
privilege
without
sufficient
effort
the
ministers
of
the
different
legations
as
is
the
harmless
custom
of
such
gentlemen
had
impressed
every
one
for
whom
they
had
obtained
permission
to
see
the
treasures
with
the
great
importance
of
the
service
rendered
and
had
succeeded
in
making
every
one
feel
either
especially
honored
or
especially
uncomfortable
at
having
given
them
so
much
trouble
this
sense
of
obligation
and
the
fact
that
the
dragomans
had
assured
the
tourists
that
they
were
for
the
time
being
the
guests
of
the
sultan
awed
and
depressed
most
of
the
visitors
to
such
an
extent
that
their
manner
in
the
long
procession
of
carriages
suggested
a
funeral
cortege
with
the
hohenwalds
in
front
escorted
by
beys
and
pashas
as
chief
mourners
the
procession
halted
at
the
palace
and
the
guests
of
the
sultan
were
received
by
numerous
effendis
in
and
freshly
ironed
fezzes
who
served
them
with
glasses
of
water
and
a
huge
bowl
of
some
sweet
stuff
of
which
every
one
was
supposed
to
take
a
spoonful
there
was
at
first
a
general
fear
among
the
cook
tourists
that
there
would
not
be
enough
of
this
to
go
round
which
was
succeeded
by
a
greater
anxiety
lest
they
should
be
served
twice
some
of
the
tourists
put
the
sweet
stuff
in
their
mouths
direct
and
licked
the
spoon
and
others
dropped
it
off
the
spoon
into
the
glass
of
water
and
stirred
it
about
and
sipped
at
it
and
no
one
knew
who
had
done
the
right
thing
not
even
those
who
happened
to
have
done
it
carlton
and
miss
morris
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
while
this
ceremony
was
going
forward
and
looked
out
over
the
great
panorama
of
waters
with
the
sea
of
marmora
on
one
side
the
golden
horn
on
the
other
and
the
bosporus
at
their
feet
the
sun
was
shining
mildly
and
the
waters
were
stirred
by
great
and
little
vessels
before
them
on
the
opposite
bank
rose
the
dark
green
cypresses
which
marked
the
grim
cemetery
of
england
dead
and
behind
them
were
the
great
mosques
and
minarets
of
the
two
cities
and
close
at
hand
the
mosaic
walls
and
beautiful
gardens
of
constantine
your
friends
the
hohenwalds
do
seem
to
know
you
this
morning
she
said
oh
yes
he
spoke
to
me
as
we
left
the
hotel
carlton
answered
but
they
are
on
parade
at
present
there
are
a
lot
of
their
countrymen
among
the
tourists
i
feel
rather
sorry
for
them
miss
morris
said
looking
at
the
group
with
an
amused
smile
etiquette
cuts
them
off
from
so
much
innocent
amusement
now
you
are
a
gentleman
and
the
duke
presumably
is
and
why
should
you
not
go
over
and
say
highness
i
wish
you
would
present
me
to
your
sister
whom
i
am
to
meet
at
dinner
night
i
admire
her
very
much
and
then
you
could
point
out
the
historical
features
to
her
and
show
her
where
they
have
finished
off
a
blue
and
green
tiled
wall
with
a
rusty
tin
roof
and
make
pretty
speeches
to
her
it
would
hurt
her
and
it
would
do
you
a
lot
of
good
the
simplest
way
is
always
the
best
way
it
seems
to
me
oh
yes
of
course
said
carlton
suppose
he
came
over
here
and
said
i
wish
you
would
present
me
to
your
young
american
friend
i
admire
her
very
much
i
would
probably
say
you
well
you
will
have
to
wait
until
she
expresses
some
desire
to
meet
you
no
etiquette
is
all
right
in
itself
only
some
people
know
its
laws
and
that
is
the
one
instance
to
my
mind
where
ignorance
of
the
law
is
no
excuse
carlton
left
miss
morris
talking
with
the
secretary
of
the
american
legation
and
went
to
look
for
downs
when
he
returned
he
found
that
the
young
secretary
had
apparently
asked
and
obtained
permission
to
present
the
duke
equerries
and
some
of
his
diplomatic
confreres
who
were
standing
now
about
her
in
an
attentive
semicircle
and
pointing
out
the
different
palaces
and
points
of
interest
carlton
was
somewhat
disturbed
at
the
sight
and
reproached
himself
with
not
having
presented
any
one
to
her
before
he
was
sure
now
that
she
must
have
had
a
dull
time
of
it
but
he
wished
nevertheless
that
if
she
was
to
meet
other
men
the
secretary
had
allowed
him
to
act
as
master
of
ceremonies
i
suppose
you
know
that
gentleman
was
saying
as
carlton
came
up
that
when
you
pass
by
abydos
on
the
way
to
athens
you
will
see
where
leander
swam
the
hellespont
to
meet
hero
that
little
white
is
called
leander
in
honor
of
him
it
makes
rather
an
interesting
contrast
does
it
not
to
think
of
that
chap
swimming
along
in
the
dark
and
then
to
find
that
his
monument
is
a
lighthouse
with
revolving
lamps
and
electric
appliances
and
with
ocean
tramps
and
bridges
and
around
it
we
have
improved
in
our
mechanism
since
then
he
said
with
an
air
but
i
am
afraid
the
men
of
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
for
the
women
of
then
it
is
the
men
who
have
deteriorated
said
one
of
the
equerries
bowing
to
miss
morris
it
is
certainly
not
the
women
the
two
americans
looked
at
miss
morris
to
see
how
she
received
this
but
she
smiled
i
know
a
man
who
did
more
than
that
for
a
woman
said
carlton
innocently
he
crossed
an
ocean
and
several
countries
to
meet
her
and
he
has
met
her
yet
miss
morris
looked
at
him
and
laughed
in
the
safety
that
no
one
understood
him
but
herself
but
he
ran
no
danger
she
answered
he
did
did
he
said
carlton
looking
at
her
closely
and
laughing
i
think
he
was
in
very
great
danger
all
the
time
shocking
said
miss
morris
reprovingly
and
in
her
very
presence
too
she
knitted
her
brows
and
frowned
at
him
i
really
believe
if
you
were
in
prison
you
would
make
pretty
speeches
to
the
daughter
yes
said
carlton
boldly
or
even
to
a
woman
who
was
a
prisoner
herself
i
do
know
what
you
mean
she
said
turning
away
from
him
to
the
others
how
far
was
it
that
leander
swam
she
asked
the
english
captain
pointed
out
two
spots
on
either
bank
and
said
that
the
shores
of
abydos
were
a
little
over
that
distance
apart
as
far
as
that
said
miss
morris
how
much
he
must
have
cared
for
her
she
turned
to
carlton
for
an
answer
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
he
was
measuring
the
distance
between
the
two
points
with
his
eyes
i
said
how
much
he
must
have
cared
for
her
you
would
swim
that
far
for
a
girl
for
a
girl
laughed
carlton
quickly
i
was
just
thinking
i
would
do
it
for
fifty
dollars
the
english
captain
gave
a
hasty
glance
at
the
distance
he
had
pointed
out
and
then
turned
to
carlton
i
take
you
he
said
seriously
i
bet
you
twenty
pounds
you
ca
do
it
there
was
an
easy
laugh
at
carlton
expense
but
he
only
shook
his
head
and
smiled
leave
him
alone
captain
said
the
american
secretary
it
seems
to
me
i
remember
a
story
of
carlton
swimming
out
from
navesink
to
meet
an
ocean
liner
it
was
about
three
miles
and
the
ocean
was
rather
rough
and
when
they
slowed
up
he
asked
them
if
it
was
raining
in
london
when
they
left
they
thought
he
was
mad
is
that
true
carlton
asked
the
englishman
something
like
it
said
the
american
except
that
i
did
ask
them
if
it
was
raining
in
london
i
asked
them
for
a
drink
and
it
was
they
who
were
mad
they
thought
i
was
drowning
and
slowed
up
to
lower
a
boat
and
when
they
found
out
i
was
just
swimming
around
they
were
naturally
angry
well
i
glad
you
did
bet
with
me
said
the
captain
with
a
relieved
laugh
that
evening
as
the
englishman
was
leaving
the
and
after
he
had
bidden
carlton
he
turned
back
and
said
i
like
to
ask
you
before
those
men
this
morning
but
there
was
something
about
your
swimming
adventure
i
wanted
to
know
did
you
get
that
drink
i
did
said
carlton
in
a
bottle
they
nearly
broke
my
shoulder
as
carlton
came
into
the
on
the
morning
of
the
day
he
was
to
meet
the
princess
aline
at
dinner
miss
morris
was
there
alone
and
he
sat
down
at
the
same
table
opposite
to
her
she
looked
at
him
critically
and
smiled
with
evident
amusement
she
quoted
solemnly
birthday
of
my
life
has
come
carlton
poured
out
his
coffee
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
frowned
oh
you
can
laugh
he
said
but
i
did
sleep
at
all
last
night
i
lay
awake
making
speeches
to
her
i
know
they
are
going
to
put
me
between
the
wrong
sisters
he
complained
or
next
to
one
of
those
old
or
whatever
they
are
how
are
you
going
to
begin
said
miss
morris
will
you
tell
her
you
have
followed
her
from
london
or
from
new
york
rather
that
you
are
young
lochinvar
who
came
out
of
the
west
and
i
do
know
said
carlton
meditatively
just
how
i
shall
begin
but
i
know
the
curtain
is
going
to
rise
promptly
at
eight
about
the
time
the
soup
comes
on
i
think
i
do
see
how
she
can
help
but
be
impressed
a
little
bit
it
is
every
day
a
man
hurries
around
the
globe
on
account
of
a
girl
photograph
and
she
is
beautiful
is
she
miss
morris
nodded
her
head
encouragingly
do
you
know
sometimes
said
carlton
glancing
over
his
shoulders
to
see
if
the
waiters
were
out
of
hearing
i
fancy
she
has
noticed
me
once
or
twice
i
have
turned
my
head
in
her
direction
without
meaning
to
and
found
her
looking
well
looking
my
way
at
least
do
you
think
that
is
a
good
sign
he
asked
eagerly
it
depends
on
what
you
call
a
sign
said
miss
morris
judicially
it
is
a
sign
you
good
to
look
at
if
that
what
you
want
but
you
probably
know
that
already
and
it
nothing
to
your
credit
it
certainly
is
a
sign
that
a
person
cares
for
you
because
she
prefers
to
look
at
your
profile
rather
than
at
what
the
dragomans
are
trying
to
show
her
carlton
drew
himself
up
stiffly
if
you
knew
your
alice
better
he
said
with
severity
you
would
understand
that
it
is
not
polite
to
make
personal
remarks
i
ask
you
as
my
confidante
if
you
think
she
has
noticed
me
and
you
make
fun
of
my
looks
that
not
the
part
of
a
confidante
noticed
you
laughed
miss
morris
scornfully
how
could
she
help
it
you
are
always
in
the
way
you
are
at
the
door
whenever
they
go
out
or
come
in
and
when
we
are
visiting
mosques
and
palaces
you
are
invariably
looking
at
her
instead
of
the
tombs
and
things
with
a
wistful
look
as
though
you
saw
a
vision
the
first
time
you
did
it
after
you
had
turned
away
i
saw
her
feel
to
see
if
her
hair
was
all
right
you
quite
embarrassed
her
i
did
i
do
stammered
carlton
indignantly
i
would
be
so
rude
oh
i
see
i
have
to
get
another
confidante
you
are
most
unsympathetic
and
unkind
but
miss
morris
showed
her
sympathy
later
in
the
day
when
carlton
needed
it
sorely
for
the
dinner
towards
which
he
had
looked
with
such
pleasurable
anticipations
and
misgivings
did
not
take
place
the
sultan
so
the
equerry
informed
him
had
with
oriental
unexpectedness
invited
the
duke
to
dine
that
night
at
the
palace
and
the
duke
much
to
his
expressed
regret
had
been
forced
to
accept
what
was
in
the
nature
of
a
command
he
sent
word
by
his
equerry
however
that
the
dinner
to
carlton
was
only
a
pleasure
deferred
and
that
at
athens
where
he
understood
carlton
was
also
going
he
hoped
to
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
him
and
making
him
known
to
his
sisters
he
is
a
selfish
young
egoist
said
carlton
to
downs
as
if
i
cared
whether
he
was
at
the
dinner
or
not
why
could
he
have
fixed
it
so
i
might
have
dined
with
his
sisters
alone
we
would
never
have
missed
him
i
never
meet
her
now
i
know
it
i
feel
it
fate
is
against
me
now
i
will
have
to
follow
them
on
to
athens
and
something
will
turn
up
there
to
keep
me
away
from
her
you
see
you
see
i
wonder
where
they
go
from
athens
the
hohenwalds
departed
the
next
morning
and
as
their
party
had
engaged
all
the
in
the
little
italian
steamer
carlton
was
forced
to
wait
over
for
the
next
he
was
very
gloomy
over
his
disappointment
and
miss
morris
did
her
best
to
amuse
him
she
and
her
aunt
were
never
idle
now
and
spent
the
last
few
days
of
their
stay
in
constantinople
in
the
bazars
or
in
excursions
up
and
down
the
river
these
are
my
last
days
of
freedom
miss
morris
said
to
him
once
and
i
mean
to
make
the
most
of
them
after
this
there
will
be
no
more
travelling
for
me
and
i
love
it
so
she
added
wistfully
carlton
made
no
comment
but
he
felt
a
certain
contemptuous
pity
for
the
young
man
in
america
who
had
required
such
a
sacrifice
she
is
too
nice
a
girl
to
let
him
know
she
is
making
a
sacrifice
he
thought
or
giving
up
anything
for
him
but
she
wo
forget
it
and
carlton
again
commended
himself
for
not
having
asked
any
woman
to
make
any
sacrifices
for
him
they
left
constantinople
for
athens
one
moonlight
night
three
days
after
the
hohenwalds
had
taken
their
departure
and
as
the
evening
and
the
air
were
warm
they
remained
upon
the
upper
deck
until
the
boat
had
entered
the
dardanelles
there
were
few
passengers
and
downs
went
below
early
leaving
miss
morris
and
carlton
hanging
over
the
rail
and
looking
down
upon
a
band
of
hungarian
gypsies
who
were
playing
the
weird
music
of
their
country
on
the
deck
beneath
them
the
low
receding
hills
lay
close
on
either
hand
and
ran
back
so
sharply
from
the
narrow
waterway
that
they
seemed
to
shut
in
the
boat
from
the
world
beyond
the
moonlight
showed
a
little
mud
fort
or
a
thatched
cottage
on
the
bank
fantastically
as
through
a
mist
and
from
time
to
time
as
they
sped
forward
they
saw
the
of
a
sentry
and
his
shadow
as
he
passed
between
it
and
them
or
stopped
to
cover
it
with
wood
the
night
was
so
still
that
they
could
hear
the
waves
in
the
steamer
wake
washing
up
over
the
stones
on
either
shore
and
the
muffled
beat
of
the
engines
echoed
back
from
either
side
of
the
valley
through
which
they
passed
there
was
a
great
lantern
hanging
midway
from
the
mast
and
shining
down
upon
the
lower
deck
it
showed
a
group
of
greeks
turks
and
armenians
in
strange
costumes
sleeping
huddled
together
in
picturesque
confusion
over
the
bare
boards
or
and
voluble
smoking
and
chatting
together
in
happy
company
the
music
of
the
tizanes
rose
in
notes
of
passionate
ecstasy
and
sharp
unexpected
bursts
of
melody
it
ceased
and
began
again
as
though
the
musicians
were
feeling
their
way
and
then
burst
out
once
more
into
shrill
defiance
it
stirred
carlton
with
a
strange
turbulent
unrest
from
the
banks
the
night
wind
brought
soft
odors
of
fresh
earth
and
of
heavy
foliage
the
music
of
different
countries
carlton
said
at
last
means
many
different
things
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
music
of
hungary
is
the
music
of
love
miss
morris
crossed
her
arms
comfortably
on
the
rail
and
he
heard
her
laugh
softly
oh
no
it
is
not
she
said
undisturbed
it
is
a
passionate
gusty
heady
sort
of
love
if
you
like
but
it
no
more
like
the
real
thing
than
burgundy
is
like
clear
cold
good
water
it
not
the
real
thing
at
all
i
beg
your
pardon
said
carlton
meekly
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
had
been
waked
out
of
the
spell
which
the
night
and
the
tizanes
had
placed
upon
him
as
completely
as
though
some
one
had
shaken
him
sharply
by
the
shoulder
i
bow
he
said
to
your
superior
knowledge
i
know
nothing
about
it
no
you
are
quite
right
i
do
believe
you
do
know
anything
about
it
said
the
girl
or
you
would
have
made
such
a
comparison
do
you
know
miss
morris
said
carlton
seriously
that
i
believe
i
not
able
to
care
for
a
woman
as
other
men
do
at
least
as
some
men
do
it
just
lacking
in
me
and
always
will
be
lacking
it
like
an
ear
for
music
if
you
have
got
it
if
it
is
born
in
you
never
have
it
it
not
a
thing
you
can
cultivate
and
i
feel
that
it
not
only
a
misfortune
but
a
fault
now
i
honestly
believe
that
i
care
more
for
the
princess
aline
whom
i
have
never
met
than
many
other
men
could
care
for
her
if
they
knew
her
well
but
what
they
feel
would
last
and
i
have
doubts
from
past
experience
that
what
i
feel
would
i
do
doubt
it
while
it
exists
but
it
never
does
exist
long
and
so
i
am
afraid
it
is
going
to
be
with
me
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
he
paused
for
a
moment
but
the
girl
did
not
answer
i
am
speaking
in
earnest
now
he
added
with
a
rueful
laugh
i
see
you
are
she
replied
briefly
she
seemed
to
be
considering
his
condition
as
he
had
described
it
to
her
and
he
did
not
interrupt
her
from
below
them
came
the
notes
of
the
waltz
the
gypsies
played
it
was
full
of
the
undercurrent
of
sadness
that
a
waltz
should
have
and
filled
out
what
carlton
said
as
the
music
from
the
orchestra
in
a
theatre
heightens
the
effect
without
interrupting
the
words
of
the
actor
on
the
stage
it
is
strange
said
miss
morris
i
should
have
thought
you
were
a
man
who
would
care
very
much
and
in
just
the
right
way
but
i
believe
really
i
sorry
but
i
do
believe
you
do
know
what
love
means
at
all
oh
it
is
as
bad
as
that
said
carlton
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
and
what
it
means
to
other
people
but
i
ca
feel
it
myself
the
best
idea
i
ever
got
of
it
the
thing
that
made
it
clear
to
me
was
a
line
in
a
play
it
seemed
to
express
it
better
than
any
of
the
i
ever
read
it
was
in
shenandoah
miss
morris
laughed
i
beg
your
pardon
said
carlton
i
beg
yours
she
said
it
was
only
the
incongruity
that
struck
me
it
seemed
so
odd
to
be
quoting
shenandoah
here
in
the
dardanelles
with
these
queer
people
below
us
and
ancient
troy
on
one
hand
it
took
me
by
surprise
that
all
please
go
on
what
was
it
impressed
you
well
the
hero
in
the
play
said
carlton
is
an
officer
in
the
northern
army
and
he
is
lying
wounded
in
a
house
near
the
shenandoah
valley
the
girl
he
loves
lives
in
this
house
and
is
nursing
him
but
she
does
love
him
because
she
sympathizes
with
the
south
at
least
she
says
she
does
love
him
both
armies
are
forming
in
the
valley
below
to
begin
the
battle
and
he
sees
his
own
regiment
hurrying
past
to
join
them
so
he
gets
up
and
staggers
out
on
the
stage
which
is
set
to
show
the
yard
in
front
of
the
and
he
calls
for
his
horse
to
follow
his
men
then
the
girl
runs
out
and
begs
him
not
to
go
and
he
asks
why
what
does
it
matter
to
her
whether
he
goes
or
not
and
she
says
i
can
not
let
you
go
you
may
be
killed
and
he
says
again
is
that
to
you
and
she
says
is
everything
to
me
i
love
you
and
he
makes
a
grab
at
her
with
his
wounded
arm
and
at
that
instant
both
armies
open
fire
in
the
valley
below
and
the
whole
earth
and
sky
seem
to
open
and
shut
and
the
house
rocks
the
girl
rushes
at
him
and
crowds
up
against
his
breast
and
cries
is
that
oh
what
is
that
and
he
holds
her
tight
to
him
and
laughs
and
says
that
only
a
battle
you
love
me
miss
morris
looked
steadfastly
over
the
side
of
the
boat
at
the
waters
rushing
by
beneath
smiling
to
herself
then
she
turned
her
face
towards
carlton
and
nodded
her
head
at
him
i
think
she
said
dryly
that
you
have
a
fair
idea
of
what
it
means
a
rough
at
least
enough
to
begin
on
i
said
that
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
others
i
am
complaining
that
i
can
not
feel
it
myself
that
will
come
in
time
no
doubt
she
said
encouragingly
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
and
let
me
tell
you
she
added
that
it
will
be
all
the
better
for
the
woman
that
you
have
doubted
yourself
so
long
you
think
so
said
carlton
eagerly
miss
morris
laughed
at
his
earnestness
and
left
him
to
go
below
to
ask
her
aunt
to
join
them
but
downs
preferred
to
read
in
the
saloon
and
miss
morris
returned
alone
she
had
taken
off
her
eton
jacket
and
pulled
on
a
heavy
blue
football
sweater
and
over
this
a
reefer
the
jersey
clung
to
her
and
showed
the
lines
of
her
figure
and
emphasized
the
freedom
and
grace
with
which
she
made
every
movement
she
looked
as
she
walked
at
his
side
with
her
hands
in
the
pockets
of
her
coat
and
with
a
flat
sailor
hat
on
her
head
like
a
tall
handsome
boy
but
when
they
stopped
and
stood
where
the
light
fell
full
on
her
hair
and
the
exquisite
coloring
of
her
skin
carlton
thought
her
face
had
never
seemed
so
delicate
or
fair
as
it
did
then
rising
from
the
collar
of
the
rough
jersey
and
contrasted
with
the
hat
and
coat
of
a
attire
they
paced
the
deck
for
an
hour
later
until
every
one
else
had
left
it
and
at
midnight
were
still
loath
to
give
up
the
beautiful
night
and
the
charm
of
their
strange
surroundings
there
were
long
silent
places
in
their
talk
during
which
carlton
tramped
beside
her
with
his
head
half
turned
looking
at
her
and
noting
with
an
eye
the
free
light
step
the
erect
carriage
and
the
unconscious
beauty
of
her
face
the
captain
of
the
steamer
joined
them
after
midnight
and
falling
into
step
pointed
out
to
miss
morris
where
great
cities
had
stood
where
others
lay
buried
and
where
beyond
the
hills
were
the
almost
inaccessible
monasteries
of
the
greek
church
the
moonlight
turned
the
banks
into
shadowy
substances
in
which
the
ghosts
of
former
days
seemed
to
make
a
part
and
spurred
by
the
young
girl
interest
the
italian
to
entertain
her
called
up
all
the
legends
of
mythology
and
the
stories
of
roman
explorers
and
turkish
conquerors
i
turn
in
now
he
said
after
miss
morris
had
left
them
a
most
charming
young
lady
is
it
not
so
he
added
waving
his
cigarette
in
a
gesture
which
expressed
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
adjective
yes
very
said
carlton
sir
he
turned
and
leaned
with
both
elbows
on
the
rail
and
looked
out
at
the
misty
banks
puffing
at
his
cigar
then
he
dropped
it
hissing
into
the
water
and
stifling
a
yawn
looked
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
deserted
deck
it
seemed
particularly
bare
and
empty
what
a
pity
she
engaged
carlton
said
she
loses
so
much
by
it
they
steamed
slowly
into
the
harbor
of
the
piraeus
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
with
a
flotilla
of
small
boats
filled
with
shrieking
porters
and
at
the
sides
these
men
tossed
their
painters
to
the
crew
and
crawled
up
them
like
a
boarding
crew
of
pirates
running
wildly
about
the
deck
and
laying
violent
hands
on
any
piece
of
baggage
they
saw
unclaimed
the
passengers
trunks
had
been
thrown
out
in
a
heap
on
the
deck
and
nolan
and
carlton
were
clambering
over
them
looking
for
their
own
effects
while
miss
morris
stood
below
as
far
out
of
the
confusion
as
she
could
place
herself
and
pointed
out
the
different
pieces
that
belonged
to
her
as
she
stood
there
one
of
the
a
burly
greasy
levantine
in
pursuit
of
a
possible
victim
shouldered
her
intentionally
and
roughly
out
of
the
way
he
shoved
her
so
sharply
that
she
lost
her
balance
and
fell
back
against
the
rail
carlton
saw
what
had
happened
and
made
a
flying
leap
from
the
top
of
the
pile
of
trunks
landing
beside
her
and
in
time
to
seize
the
escaping
offender
by
the
collar
he
jerked
him
back
off
his
feet
how
dare
you
he
began
but
he
did
not
finish
he
felt
the
tips
of
miss
morris
fingers
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
her
voice
saying
in
an
annoyed
tone
do
please
do
and
to
his
surprise
his
fingers
lost
their
grip
on
the
man
shirt
his
arms
dropped
at
his
side
and
his
blood
began
to
flow
calmly
again
through
his
veins
carlton
was
aware
that
he
had
a
very
quick
temper
he
was
always
engaging
in
street
rows
as
he
called
them
with
men
who
he
thought
had
imposed
on
him
or
on
some
one
else
and
though
he
was
always
ashamed
of
himself
later
his
temper
had
never
been
satisfied
without
a
blow
or
an
apology
women
had
also
touched
him
before
and
possibly
with
a
greater
familiarity
but
these
had
stirred
him
not
quieted
him
and
men
who
had
laid
detaining
hands
on
him
had
had
them
beaten
down
for
their
pains
but
this
girl
had
merely
touched
him
gently
and
he
had
been
made
helpless
it
was
most
perplexing
and
while
the
officials
were
passing
his
luggage
he
found
himself
rubbing
his
arm
curiously
as
though
it
were
numb
and
looking
down
at
it
with
an
amused
smile
he
did
not
comment
on
the
incident
although
he
smiled
at
the
recollection
of
his
prompt
obedience
several
times
during
the
day
but
as
he
was
stepping
into
the
cab
to
drive
to
athens
he
saw
the
offending
ruffian
pass
dripping
with
water
and
muttering
bitter
curses
when
he
saw
carlton
he
disappeared
instantly
in
the
crowd
carlton
stepped
over
to
where
nolan
sat
beside
the
driver
on
the
box
nolan
he
said
in
a
low
voice
is
that
the
fellow
who
yes
sir
said
nolan
touching
his
hat
gravely
he
was
pulling
a
valise
one
way
and
the
gentleman
that
owned
it
sir
was
pulling
it
the
other
and
the
gentleman
let
go
sudden
and
the
italian
went
over
backwards
off
the
pier
carlton
smiled
grimly
with
secret
satisfaction
nolan
he
said
you
not
telling
the
truth
you
did
it
yourself
nolan
touched
his
cap
and
coughed
consciously
there
had
been
no
detaining
fingers
on
nolan
arm
iii
you
are
coming
now
miss
morris
exclaimed
carlton
from
the
front
of
the
carriage
in
which
they
were
moving
along
the
sunny
road
to
athens
into
a
land
where
one
restores
his
lost
illusions
anybody
who
wishes
to
get
back
his
belief
in
beautiful
things
should
come
here
to
do
it
just
as
he
would
go
to
a
german
sanitarium
to
build
up
his
nerves
or
his
appetite
you
have
only
to
drink
in
the
atmosphere
and
you
are
cured
i
know
no
better
antidote
than
athens
for
a
siege
of
and
muddy
asphalt
pavements
and
a
course
of
robert
elsmeres
and
the
heavenly
twins
wait
until
you
see
the
statues
of
the
young
athletes
in
the
museum
he
cried
enthusiastically
and
get
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
back
of
mount
hymettus
and
the
moonlight
some
evening
on
the
acropolis
and
you
be
convinced
that
nothing
counts
for
much
in
this
world
but
health
and
straight
limbs
and
tall
marble
pillars
and
eyes
trained
to
see
only
what
is
beautiful
give
people
a
love
for
beauty
and
a
respect
for
health
miss
morris
and
the
result
is
going
to
be
what
they
once
had
here
the
best
art
and
the
greatest
writers
and
satirists
and
poets
the
same
audience
that
applauded
euripides
and
sophocles
in
the
open
theatre
used
to
cross
the
road
the
same
day
to
applaud
the
athletes
who
ran
naked
in
the
olympian
games
and
gave
them
as
great
honor
i
came
here
once
on
a
walking
tour
with
a
chap
who
was
making
as
much
of
himself
as
he
should
have
done
and
he
went
away
a
changed
man
and
became
a
personage
in
the
world
and
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
that
did
it
he
saw
a
statue
of
one
of
the
greek
gods
in
the
museum
which
showed
certain
muscles
that
he
find
in
his
own
body
and
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
train
down
until
they
did
show
and
he
stopped
drinking
and
loafing
to
do
it
and
took
to
exercising
and
working
and
by
the
time
the
muscles
showed
out
clear
and
strong
he
was
so
keen
over
life
that
he
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
it
and
as
i
said
he
has
done
it
that
what
a
respect
for
his
own
body
did
for
him
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
hotel
on
one
side
of
the
public
square
of
athens
with
the
palace
and
its
gardens
blocking
one
end
and
yellow
houses
with
red
roofs
and
gay
awnings
over
the
cafes
surrounding
it
it
was
a
bright
sunny
day
and
the
city
was
clean
and
cool
and
pretty
breakfast
exclaimed
miss
morris
in
answer
to
carlton
inquiry
yes
i
suppose
so
but
i
wo
feel
safe
until
i
have
my
feet
on
that
rock
she
was
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
looking
up
with
expectant
eager
eyes
at
the
great
acropolis
above
the
city
it
has
been
there
for
a
long
time
now
suggested
carlton
and
i
think
you
can
risk
its
being
there
for
a
longer
well
she
said
reluctantly
but
i
do
wish
to
lose
this
chance
there
might
be
an
earthquake
for
instance
we
are
likely
to
see
them
this
morning
said
carlton
as
he
left
the
hotel
with
the
ladies
and
drove
towards
the
acropolis
nolan
has
been
interviewing
the
english
maid
and
she
tells
him
they
spend
the
greater
part
of
their
time
up
there
on
the
rock
they
are
living
very
simply
here
as
they
did
in
paris
that
is
for
the
present
on
wednesday
the
king
gives
a
dinner
and
a
reception
in
their
honor
when
does
your
dinner
come
off
asked
miss
morris
never
said
carlton
grimly
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
like
to
come
back
to
athens
so
much
said
downs
is
because
there
are
so
few
other
tourists
here
to
spoil
the
local
color
for
you
and
there
are
almost
as
few
guides
as
tourists
so
that
you
can
wander
around
undisturbed
and
discover
things
for
yourself
they
do
label
every
fallen
column
and
place
fences
around
the
temples
they
seem
to
put
you
on
your
good
behavior
then
i
always
like
to
go
to
a
place
where
you
are
as
much
of
a
curiosity
to
the
people
as
they
are
to
you
it
seems
to
excuse
your
staring
about
you
a
curiosity
exclaimed
carlton
i
should
say
so
the
last
time
i
was
here
i
tried
to
wear
a
pair
of
knickerbockers
around
the
city
and
the
people
stared
so
that
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
and
change
them
i
should
have
minded
it
so
much
in
any
other
country
but
i
thought
men
who
wore
jaeger
underclothing
and
women
petticoats
for
a
national
costume
might
have
excused
so
slight
an
eccentricity
as
knickerbockers
they
had
no
right
to
throw
the
first
stone
the
rock
upon
which
the
temples
of
the
acropolis
are
built
is
more
of
a
hill
than
a
rock
it
is
much
steeper
upon
one
side
than
the
other
with
a
sheer
fall
a
hundred
yards
broad
on
the
opposite
side
there
are
the
rooms
of
the
hospital
of
aesculapius
and
the
theatres
of
dionysus
and
herodes
atticus
the
top
of
the
rock
holds
the
parthenon
and
the
other
smaller
temples
or
what
yet
remains
of
them
and
its
surface
is
littered
with
broken
marble
and
stones
and
pieces
of
rock
the
top
is
so
closely
built
over
that
the
few
tourists
who
visit
it
can
imagine
themselves
its
sole
occupants
for
a
at
a
time
when
carlton
and
his
friends
arrived
the
place
appeared
quite
deserted
they
left
the
carriage
at
the
base
of
the
rock
and
climbed
up
to
the
entrance
on
foot
now
before
i
go
on
to
the
parthenon
said
miss
morris
i
want
to
walk
around
the
sides
and
see
what
is
there
i
shall
begin
with
that
theatre
to
the
left
and
i
warn
you
that
i
mean
to
take
my
time
about
it
so
you
people
who
have
been
here
before
can
run
along
by
yourselves
but
i
mean
to
enjoy
it
leisurely
i
am
safe
by
myself
here
am
i
not
she
asked
as
safe
as
though
you
were
in
the
metropolitan
museum
said
carlton
as
he
and
downs
followed
miss
morris
along
the
side
of
the
hill
towards
the
ruined
theatre
of
herodes
and
stood
at
its
top
looking
down
into
the
basin
below
from
their
feet
ran
a
great
semicircle
of
marble
seats
descending
tier
below
tier
to
a
marble
pavement
and
facing
a
great
ruined
wall
of
pillars
and
arches
which
in
the
past
had
formed
the
background
for
the
actors
from
the
height
on
which
they
stood
above
the
city
they
could
see
the
green
country
stretching
out
for
miles
on
every
side
and
swimming
in
the
warm
sunlight
the
dark
groves
of
myrtle
on
the
hills
the
silver
ribbon
of
the
inland
water
and
the
dark
blue
aegean
sea
the
bleating
of
sheep
and
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
came
up
to
them
from
the
pastures
below
and
they
imagined
they
could
hear
the
shepherds
piping
to
their
flocks
from
one
little
to
another
the
country
is
not
much
changed
said
carlton
and
when
you
stand
where
we
are
now
you
can
imagine
that
you
see
the
procession
winding
its
way
over
the
road
to
the
eleusinian
mysteries
with
the
gilded
chariots
and
the
children
carrying
garlands
and
the
priestesses
leading
the
bulls
for
the
sacrifice
what
can
we
imagine
is
going
on
here
said
miss
morris
pointing
with
her
parasol
to
the
theatre
below
oh
this
is
much
later
said
carlton
this
was
built
by
the
romans
they
used
to
act
and
to
hold
their
public
meetings
here
this
corresponds
to
the
top
row
of
our
gallery
and
you
can
imagine
that
you
are
looking
down
on
the
bent
backs
of
hundreds
of
men
in
white
robes
listening
to
the
speakers
strutting
about
below
there
i
wonder
how
much
they
could
hear
from
this
height
said
downs
well
they
had
that
big
wall
for
a
and
the
air
is
so
soft
here
that
their
voices
should
have
carried
easily
and
i
believe
they
wore
masks
with
that
conveyed
the
sound
like
a
fireman
trumpet
if
you
like
i
will
run
down
there
and
call
up
to
you
and
you
can
hear
how
it
sounded
i
will
speak
in
my
natural
voice
first
and
if
that
does
reach
you
wave
your
parasol
and
i
will
try
it
a
little
louder
oh
do
said
miss
morris
it
will
be
very
good
of
you
i
should
like
to
hear
a
real
speech
in
the
theatre
of
herodes
she
said
as
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
marble
crater
i
have
to
speak
in
english
said
carlton
as
he
disappeared
my
greek
is
good
enough
to
carry
that
far
downs
seated
herself
beside
her
niece
and
carlton
began
scrambling
down
the
side
of
the
amphitheatre
the
marble
benches
were
broken
in
parts
and
where
they
were
perfect
were
covered
with
a
fine
layer
of
moss
as
smooth
and
soft
as
green
velvet
so
that
carlton
when
he
was
not
laboriously
feeling
for
his
next
foothold
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
was
engaged
in
picking
spring
flowers
from
the
beds
of
moss
and
sticking
them
for
in
his
he
was
several
minutes
in
making
the
descent
and
so
busily
occupied
in
doing
it
that
he
did
not
look
up
until
he
had
reached
the
level
of
the
ground
and
jumped
lightly
from
the
first
row
of
seats
to
the
stage
covered
with
moss
which
lay
like
a
heavy
rug
over
the
marble
pavement
when
he
did
look
up
he
saw
a
tableau
that
made
his
heart
which
was
beating
quickly
from
the
exertion
of
the
descent
stand
still
with
consternation
the
hohenwalds
had
in
his
short
absence
descended
from
the
entrance
of
the
acropolis
and
had
stopped
on
their
way
to
the
road
below
to
look
into
the
cool
green
and
white
basin
of
the
theatre
at
the
moment
carlton
looked
up
the
duke
was
standing
in
front
of
downs
and
miss
morris
and
all
of
the
men
had
their
hats
off
then
in
pantomime
and
silhouetted
against
the
blue
sky
behind
them
carlton
saw
the
princesses
advance
beside
their
brother
and
downs
and
her
niece
courtesied
three
times
and
then
the
whole
party
faced
about
in
a
line
and
looked
down
at
him
the
meaning
of
the
tableau
was
only
too
plain
good
heavens
gasped
carlton
everybody
getting
introduced
to
everybody
else
and
i
missed
the
whole
thing
if
they
think
going
to
stay
down
here
and
amuse
them
and
miss
all
the
fun
myself
they
are
greatly
mistaken
he
made
a
mad
rush
for
the
front
first
row
of
seats
but
there
was
a
cry
of
remonstrance
from
above
and
looking
up
he
saw
all
of
the
men
waving
him
back
speech
cried
the
young
english
captain
applauding
loudly
as
though
welcoming
an
actor
on
his
first
entrance
hats
off
he
cried
down
in
front
speech
confound
that
ass
said
carlton
dropping
back
to
the
marble
pavement
again
and
gazing
impotently
up
at
the
row
of
figures
outlined
against
the
sky
i
must
look
like
a
bear
in
the
at
the
zoo
he
growled
they
be
throwing
buns
to
me
next
he
could
see
the
two
elder
sisters
talking
to
downs
who
was
evidently
explaining
his
purpose
in
going
down
to
the
stage
of
the
theatre
and
he
could
see
the
princess
aline
bending
forward
with
both
hands
on
her
parasol
and
smiling
the
captain
made
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
and
asked
why
he
did
begin
hello
how
are
you
carlton
called
back
waving
his
hat
at
him
in
some
embarrassment
i
wonder
if
i
look
as
much
like
a
fool
as
i
feel
he
muttered
what
did
you
say
we
ca
hear
you
answered
the
captain
louder
louder
called
the
equerries
carlton
swore
at
them
under
his
breath
and
turned
and
gazed
round
the
hole
in
which
he
was
penned
in
order
to
make
them
believe
that
he
had
given
up
the
idea
of
making
a
speech
or
had
ever
intended
doing
so
he
tried
to
think
of
something
clever
to
shout
back
at
them
and
rejected
ye
men
of
athens
as
being
too
flippant
and
friends
countrymen
romans
as
requiring
too
much
effort
when
he
looked
up
again
the
hohenwalds
were
moving
on
their
way
and
as
he
started
once
more
to
scale
the
side
of
the
theatre
the
duke
waved
his
hand
at
him
in
farewell
and
gave
another
hand
to
his
sisters
who
disappeared
with
him
behind
the
edge
of
the
upper
row
of
seats
carlton
turned
at
once
and
dropped
into
one
of
the
marble
chairs
and
bowed
his
head
when
he
did
reach
the
top
miss
morris
held
out
a
sympathetic
hand
to
him
and
shook
her
head
sadly
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
pressing
her
lips
tightly
together
to
keep
from
smiling
oh
it
all
very
funny
for
you
he
said
refusing
her
hand
i
do
believe
you
are
in
love
with
anybody
you
do
know
what
it
means
they
revisited
the
rock
on
the
next
day
and
on
the
day
after
and
then
left
athens
for
an
inland
excursion
to
stay
overnight
miss
morris
returned
from
it
with
the
sense
of
having
done
her
duty
once
and
by
so
doing
having
earned
the
right
to
act
as
she
pleased
in
the
future
what
she
best
pleased
to
do
was
to
wander
about
over
the
broad
top
of
the
acropolis
with
no
serious
intent
of
studying
its
historical
values
but
rather
as
she
explained
it
for
the
simple
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
she
was
there
she
liked
to
stand
on
the
edge
of
the
low
wall
along
its
top
and
look
out
over
the
picture
of
sea
and
plain
and
mountains
that
lay
below
her
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
the
wind
swept
by
them
as
though
they
were
on
the
bridge
of
an
ocean
steamer
and
there
was
the
added
invigorating
sense
of
pleasure
that
comes
to
us
when
we
stand
on
a
great
height
carlton
was
sitting
at
her
feet
shielded
from
the
wind
by
a
fallen
column
and
gazing
up
at
her
with
critical
approval
you
look
like
a
sort
of
a
victory
up
there
he
said
with
the
wind
blowing
your
skirts
about
and
your
hair
coming
down
i
do
remember
that
the
victory
has
any
hair
to
blow
about
suggested
miss
morris
i
like
to
paint
you
continued
carlton
just
as
you
are
standing
now
only
i
would
put
you
in
a
greek
dress
and
you
could
stand
a
greek
dress
better
than
almost
any
one
i
know
i
would
paint
you
with
your
head
up
and
one
hand
shielding
your
eyes
and
the
other
pressed
against
your
breast
it
would
be
stunning
he
spoke
enthusiastically
but
in
quite
an
impersonal
tone
as
though
he
were
discussing
the
posing
of
a
model
miss
morris
jumped
down
from
the
low
wall
on
which
she
had
been
standing
and
said
simply
of
course
i
should
like
to
have
you
paint
me
very
much
downs
looked
up
with
interest
to
see
if
carlton
was
serious
when
said
carlton
vaguely
oh
i
do
know
of
course
this
is
entirely
too
nice
to
last
and
you
will
be
going
home
soon
and
then
when
i
do
get
back
to
the
states
you
will
you
will
have
other
things
to
do
yes
repeated
miss
morris
i
shall
have
something
else
to
do
besides
gazing
out
at
the
aegean
sea
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
across
the
rock
for
a
moment
with
some
interest
her
eyes
which
had
grown
wistful
lighted
again
with
amusement
here
are
your
friends
she
said
smiling
no
exclaimed
carlton
scrambling
to
his
feet
yes
said
miss
morris
the
duke
has
seen
us
and
is
coming
over
here
when
carlton
had
gained
his
feet
and
turned
to
look
his
friends
had
separated
in
different
directions
and
were
strolling
about
alone
or
in
pairs
among
the
great
columns
of
the
parthenon
but
the
duke
came
directly
towards
them
and
seated
himself
on
a
low
block
of
marble
in
front
of
the
two
ladies
after
a
word
or
two
about
the
beauties
of
the
place
he
asked
if
they
would
go
to
the
reception
which
the
king
gave
to
him
on
the
day
following
they
answered
that
they
should
like
to
come
very
much
and
the
prince
expressed
his
satisfaction
and
said
that
he
would
see
that
the
chamberlain
sent
them
invitations
and
you
carlton
you
will
come
also
i
hope
i
wish
you
to
be
presented
to
my
sisters
they
are
only
amateurs
in
art
but
they
are
great
admirers
of
your
work
and
they
have
rebuked
me
for
not
having
already
presented
you
we
were
all
disappointed
he
continued
courteously
at
not
having
you
to
dine
with
us
that
night
in
constantinople
but
now
i
trust
i
shall
see
something
of
you
here
you
must
tell
us
what
we
are
to
admire
that
is
very
easy
said
carlton
everything
you
are
quite
right
said
the
prince
bowing
to
the
ladies
as
he
moved
away
it
is
all
very
beautiful
well
now
you
certainly
will
meet
her
said
miss
morris
oh
no
i
wo
said
carlton
with
resignation
i
have
had
two
chances
and
lost
them
and
i
miss
this
one
too
well
there
is
a
chance
you
should
miss
said
miss
morris
pointing
and
nodding
her
head
there
she
is
now
and
all
alone
she
sketching
is
she
or
taking
notes
what
is
she
doing
carlton
looked
eagerly
in
the
direction
miss
morris
had
signified
and
saw
the
princess
aline
sitting
at
some
distance
from
them
with
a
book
on
her
lap
she
glanced
up
from
this
now
and
again
to
look
at
something
ahead
of
her
and
was
apparently
deeply
absorbed
in
her
occupation
there
is
your
opportunity
said
downs
and
we
are
going
back
to
the
hotel
shall
we
see
you
at
luncheon
yes
said
carlton
unless
i
get
a
position
as
in
that
case
i
shall
be
here
teaching
the
three
amateurs
in
art
do
you
think
i
can
do
it
he
asked
miss
morris
decidedly
she
answered
i
have
found
you
a
most
educational
young
person
they
went
away
together
and
carlton
moved
cautiously
towards
the
spot
where
the
princess
was
sitting
he
made
a
long
and
roundabout
detour
as
he
did
so
in
order
to
keep
himself
behind
her
he
did
not
mean
to
come
so
near
that
she
would
see
him
but
he
took
a
certain
satisfaction
in
looking
at
her
when
she
was
alone
though
her
loneliness
was
only
a
matter
of
the
moment
and
though
he
knew
that
her
people
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
her
he
was
in
consequence
somewhat
annoyed
and
surprised
to
see
another
young
man
dodging
in
and
out
among
the
pillars
of
the
parthenon
immediately
ahead
of
him
and
to
find
that
this
young
man
also
had
his
attention
centred
on
the
young
girl
who
sat
unconsciously
sketching
in
the
foreground
now
what
the
devil
can
he
want
muttered
carlton
his
imagination
taking
alarm
at
once
if
it
would
only
prove
to
be
some
one
who
meant
harm
to
her
he
thought
a
brigand
or
a
beggar
who
might
be
obligingly
insolent
or
even
a
tipsy
man
what
a
chance
it
would
afford
for
heroic
action
with
this
hope
he
moved
forward
quickly
but
silently
hoping
that
the
stranger
might
prove
even
to
be
an
anarchist
with
a
grudge
against
royalty
and
as
he
advanced
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
princess
glance
over
her
shoulder
and
observing
the
man
rise
and
walk
quickly
away
towards
the
edge
of
the
rock
there
she
seated
herself
with
her
face
towards
the
city
and
with
her
back
firmly
set
against
her
pursuer
he
is
annoying
her
exclaimed
carlton
delightedly
as
he
hurried
forward
it
looks
as
though
my
chance
had
come
at
last
but
as
he
approached
the
stranger
he
saw
to
his
great
disappointment
that
he
had
nothing
more
serious
to
deal
with
than
one
of
the
international
army
of
amateur
photographers
who
had
been
stalking
the
princess
as
a
hunter
follows
an
elk
or
as
he
would
have
stalked
a
or
a
prominent
politician
or
a
lord
mayor
show
everything
being
fish
that
came
within
the
focus
of
his
camera
a
helpless
statue
and
an
equally
helpless
young
girl
were
both
good
subjects
and
at
his
mercy
he
was
bending
over
with
an
anxious
expression
of
countenance
and
focussing
his
camera
on
the
back
of
the
princess
aline
when
carlton
approached
from
the
rear
as
the
young
man
put
his
finger
on
the
button
of
the
camera
carlton
jogged
his
arm
with
his
elbow
and
pushed
the
enthusiastic
tourist
to
one
side
say
exclaimed
that
individual
look
where
you
going
will
you
you
spoiled
that
plate
i
spoil
your
camera
if
you
annoy
that
young
lady
any
longer
said
carlton
in
a
low
voice
the
photographer
was
rapidly
rewinding
his
roll
and
the
fire
of
pursuit
was
still
in
his
eye
she
a
princess
he
explained
in
an
excited
whisper
well
said
carlton
even
a
princess
is
entitled
to
some
consideration
besides
he
said
in
a
more
amicable
tone
you
have
a
permit
to
photograph
on
the
acropolis
you
know
you
have
carlton
was
quite
sure
of
this
because
there
were
no
such
permits
the
amateur
looked
up
in
some
dismay
i
did
know
you
had
to
have
them
he
said
where
can
i
get
one
the
king
may
give
you
one
said
carlton
he
lives
at
the
palace
if
they
catch
you
up
here
without
a
license
they
will
confiscate
your
camera
and
lock
you
up
you
had
better
vanish
before
they
see
you
thank
you
i
will
said
the
tourist
anxiously
now
thought
carlton
smiling
pleasantly
when
he
goes
to
the
palace
with
that
box
and
asks
for
a
permit
they
think
he
is
either
a
dynamiter
or
a
crank
and
before
they
are
through
with
him
his
interest
in
photography
will
have
sustained
a
severe
shock
as
carlton
turned
from
watching
the
rapid
flight
of
the
photographer
he
observed
that
the
princess
had
remarked
it
also
as
she
had
no
doubt
been
a
witness
of
what
had
passed
even
if
she
had
not
overheard
all
that
had
been
said
she
rose
from
her
enforced
position
of
refuge
with
a
look
of
relief
and
came
directly
towards
carlton
along
the
rough
path
that
led
through
the
debris
on
the
top
of
the
acropolis
carlton
had
thought
as
he
watched
her
sitting
on
the
wall
with
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
that
she
would
make
a
beautiful
companion
picture
to
the
one
he
had
wished
to
paint
of
miss
morris
the
one
girl
standing
upright
looking
fearlessly
out
to
sea
on
the
top
of
the
low
wall
with
the
wind
blowing
her
skirts
about
her
and
her
hair
tumbled
in
the
breeze
and
the
other
seated
bending
intently
forward
as
though
watching
for
the
return
of
a
vessel
a
beautifully
sad
face
fine
and
delicate
and
noble
the
face
of
a
girl
on
the
figure
of
a
woman
and
when
she
rose
he
made
no
effort
to
move
away
or
indeed
to
pretend
not
to
have
seen
her
but
stood
looking
at
her
as
though
he
had
the
right
to
do
so
and
as
though
she
must
know
he
had
that
right
as
she
came
towards
him
the
princess
aline
did
not
stop
nor
even
shorten
her
steps
but
as
she
passed
opposite
to
him
she
bowed
her
thanks
with
a
sweet
impersonal
smile
and
a
dropping
of
the
eyes
and
continued
steadily
on
her
way
carlton
stood
for
some
short
time
looking
after
her
with
his
hat
still
at
his
side
she
seemed
farther
from
him
at
that
moment
than
she
had
ever
been
before
although
she
had
for
the
first
time
recognized
him
but
he
knew
that
it
was
only
as
a
human
being
that
she
had
recognized
him
he
put
on
his
hat
and
sat
down
on
a
rock
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
filled
his
pipe
if
that
had
been
any
other
girl
he
thought
i
would
have
gone
up
to
her
and
said
that
man
annoying
you
and
she
would
have
said
thank
you
or
something
and
i
would
have
walked
along
with
her
until
we
had
come
up
to
her
friends
and
she
would
have
told
them
i
had
been
of
some
slight
service
to
her
and
they
would
have
introduced
us
and
all
would
have
gone
well
but
because
she
is
a
princess
she
can
not
be
approached
in
that
way
at
least
she
does
not
think
so
and
i
have
to
act
as
she
has
been
told
i
should
act
and
not
as
i
think
i
should
after
all
she
is
only
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
she
must
be
very
tired
of
her
cousins
and
grandmothers
and
of
not
being
allowed
to
see
any
one
else
these
royalties
make
a
very
picturesque
show
for
the
rest
of
us
but
indeed
it
seems
rather
hard
on
them
a
hundred
years
from
now
there
will
be
no
more
kings
and
queens
and
the
writers
of
that
day
will
envy
us
just
as
the
writers
of
this
day
envy
the
men
who
wrote
of
chivalry
and
tournaments
and
they
will
have
to
choose
their
heroes
from
bank
presidents
and
their
heroines
from
lady
lawyers
and
girl
politicians
and
what
a
stupid
world
it
will
be
then
the
next
day
brought
the
reception
to
the
hohenwalds
and
carlton
entering
the
of
the
hotel
on
the
same
afternoon
found
miss
morris
and
her
aunt
there
together
taking
tea
they
both
looked
at
him
with
expressions
of
such
genuine
commiseration
that
he
stopped
just
as
he
was
going
to
seat
himself
and
eyed
them
defiantly
do
tell
me
he
exclaimed
that
this
has
fallen
through
too
miss
morris
nodded
her
head
silently
carlton
dropped
into
the
chair
beside
them
and
folded
his
arms
with
a
frown
of
grim
resignation
what
is
it
he
asked
have
they
postponed
the
reception
no
miss
morris
said
but
the
princess
aline
will
not
be
there
of
course
not
said
carlton
calmly
of
course
not
may
i
ask
why
i
knew
that
she
would
be
there
but
i
may
possibly
be
allowed
to
express
some
curiosity
she
turned
her
ankle
on
one
of
the
loose
stones
on
the
acropolis
this
afternoon
said
miss
morris
and
sprained
it
so
badly
that
they
had
to
carry
her
who
carried
her
carlton
demanded
fiercely
some
of
her
servants
of
course
of
course
cried
carlton
that
the
way
it
always
will
be
i
was
there
the
whole
afternoon
and
i
did
see
her
i
there
to
help
her
it
fate
that
what
it
is
fate
there
no
use
in
my
trying
to
fight
against
fate
still
he
added
anxiously
with
a
sudden
access
of
hope
she
may
be
well
by
this
evening
i
hardly
think
she
will
said
miss
morris
but
we
will
trust
so
the
king
palace
and
gardens
stretch
along
one
end
of
the
public
park
and
are
but
just
across
the
street
from
the
hotel
where
the
hohenwalds
and
the
americans
were
staying
as
the
hotel
was
the
first
building
on
the
left
of
the
square
carlton
could
see
from
his
windows
the
illuminations
and
the
guards
of
honor
and
the
carriages
arriving
and
departing
and
the
citizens
of
athens
crowding
the
parks
and
peering
through
the
iron
rails
into
the
king
garden
it
was
a
warm
night
and
lighted
grandly
by
a
full
moon
that
showed
the
acropolis
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
and
gave
a
strangely
theatrical
look
to
the
yellow
house
fronts
and
red
roofs
of
the
town
every
window
in
the
broad
front
of
the
palace
was
illuminated
and
through
the
open
doors
came
the
sound
of
music
and
one
without
could
see
rows
of
tall
servants
in
the
king
blue
and
white
livery
and
the
men
of
his
guard
in
their
white
petticoats
and
black
and
white
jackets
and
red
caps
carlton
pulled
a
light
coat
over
his
evening
dress
and
with
an
agitation
he
could
hardly
explain
walked
across
the
street
and
entered
the
palace
the
line
of
royalties
had
broken
by
the
time
he
reached
the
ballroom
and
the
not
etiquette
of
the
greek
court
left
him
free
after
a
bow
to
those
who
still
waited
to
receive
it
to
move
about
as
he
pleased
his
most
earnest
desire
was
to
learn
whether
or
not
the
princess
aline
was
present
and
with
that
end
he
clutched
the
english
adjutant
as
that
gentleman
was
hurrying
past
him
and
asked
eagerly
if
the
princess
had
recovered
from
her
accident
no
said
the
officer
she
able
to
walk
about
but
not
to
stand
and
sit
out
a
dinner
and
dance
and
all
this
sort
of
thing
too
bad
was
it
yes
said
carlton
very
bad
he
released
his
hand
from
the
arm
and
dropped
back
among
the
men
grouped
about
the
doorway
his
disappointment
was
very
keen
indeed
he
had
not
known
how
much
this
meeting
with
the
princess
had
meant
to
him
until
he
experienced
this
disappointment
which
was
succeeded
by
a
wish
to
find
miss
morris
and
have
her
sympathize
and
laugh
with
him
he
became
conscious
as
he
searched
with
growing
impatience
the
faces
of
those
passing
and
repassing
before
him
of
how
much
the
habit
of
going
to
miss
morris
for
sympathy
in
his
unlucky
had
grown
of
late
upon
him
he
wondered
what
he
would
have
done
in
his
travels
without
her
and
whether
he
should
have
had
the
interest
to
carry
on
his
pursuit
had
she
not
been
there
to
urge
him
on
and
to
mock
at
him
when
he
grew
fainthearted
but
when
he
finally
did
discover
her
he
stood
quite
still
and
for
an
instant
doubted
if
it
were
she
the
girl
he
saw
seemed
to
be
a
more
beautiful
sister
of
the
miss
morris
he
knew
a
taller
fairer
and
more
radiant
personage
and
he
feared
that
it
was
not
she
until
he
remembered
that
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
her
with
her
hair
dressed
high
upon
her
head
and
in
the
more
distinguished
accessories
of
a
décolleté
gown
and
train
miss
morris
had
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
equerries
who
was
battling
with
the
crowd
and
trying
to
draw
her
away
from
two
persistent
youths
in
diplomatic
uniform
who
were
laughing
and
pressing
forward
in
close
pursuit
on
the
other
side
carlton
approached
her
with
a
certain
feeling
of
diffidence
which
was
most
unusual
to
him
and
asked
if
she
were
dancing
carlton
shall
decide
for
me
miss
morris
said
dropping
the
equerry
arm
and
standing
beside
the
american
i
have
promised
all
of
these
gentlemen
she
explained
to
dance
with
them
and
now
they
wo
agree
as
to
which
is
to
dance
first
they
wasted
half
this
waltz
already
in
discussing
it
and
they
make
it
much
more
difficult
by
saying
that
no
matter
how
i
decide
they
will
fight
duels
with
the
one
i
choose
which
is
most
unpleasant
for
me
most
unpleasant
for
the
gentleman
you
choose
too
suggested
carlton
so
continued
miss
morris
i
have
decided
to
leave
it
to
you
well
if
i
am
to
arbitrate
between
the
powers
said
carlton
with
a
glance
at
the
three
uniforms
my
decision
is
that
as
they
insist
on
fighting
duels
in
any
event
you
had
better
dance
with
me
until
they
have
settled
it
between
them
and
then
the
survivor
can
have
the
next
dance
that
a
very
good
idea
said
miss
morris
and
taking
carlton
arm
she
bowed
to
the
three
men
and
drew
away
carlton
said
the
equerry
with
a
bow
has
added
another
argument
in
favor
of
maintaining
standing
armies
and
of
not
submitting
questions
to
arbitration
let
get
out
of
this
said
carlton
you
do
want
to
dance
do
you
let
us
go
where
it
cool
he
led
her
down
the
stairs
and
out
on
to
the
terrace
they
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
left
it
and
were
walking
under
the
trees
in
the
queen
garden
he
had
noticed
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
crowd
how
the
men
and
women
turned
to
look
at
her
and
made
way
for
her
and
how
utterly
unconscious
she
was
of
their
doing
so
with
that
unconsciousness
which
comes
from
familiarity
with
such
discrimination
and
carlton
himself
held
his
head
a
little
higher
with
the
pride
and
pleasure
the
thought
gave
him
that
he
was
in
such
friendly
sympathy
with
so
beautiful
a
creature
he
stopped
before
a
low
stone
bench
that
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
path
surrounded
by
a
screen
of
tropical
trees
and
guarded
by
a
marble
statue
they
were
in
deep
shadow
themselves
but
the
moonlight
fell
on
the
path
at
their
feet
and
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
path
they
could
see
the
open
terrace
of
the
palace
with
the
dancers
moving
in
and
out
of
the
lighted
windows
the
splash
of
a
fountain
came
from
some
short
distance
behind
them
and
from
time
to
time
they
heard
the
strains
of
a
regimental
band
alternating
with
the
softer
strains
of
a
waltz
played
by
a
group
of
hungarian
musicians
for
a
moment
neither
of
them
spoke
but
sat
watching
the
white
dresses
of
the
women
and
the
uniforms
of
the
men
moving
in
and
out
among
the
trees
lighted
by
the
lanterns
hanging
from
the
branches
and
the
white
mist
of
the
moon
do
you
know
said
carlton
i
rather
afraid
of
you
he
paused
and
watched
her
for
a
little
time
as
she
sat
upright
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
you
are
so
very
resplendent
and
queenly
and
altogether
different
he
added
the
girl
moved
her
bare
shoulders
slightly
and
leaned
back
against
the
bench
the
princess
did
not
come
she
said
no
carlton
answered
with
a
sudden
twinge
of
conscience
at
having
forgotten
that
fact
that
one
of
the
reasons
i
took
you
away
from
those
men
he
explained
i
wanted
you
to
sympathize
with
me
miss
morris
did
not
answer
him
at
once
she
did
not
seem
to
be
in
a
sympathetic
mood
her
manner
suggested
rather
that
she
was
tired
and
troubled
i
need
sympathy
myself
she
said
we
received
a
letter
after
dinner
that
brought
bad
news
for
us
we
must
go
home
at
once
bad
news
exclaimed
carlton
with
much
concern
from
home
yes
from
home
she
replied
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
there
it
is
only
bad
news
for
us
my
sister
has
decided
to
be
married
in
june
instead
of
july
and
that
cuts
us
out
of
a
month
on
the
continent
that
all
we
shall
have
to
leave
immediately
tomorrow
it
seems
that
abbey
is
able
to
go
away
sooner
than
he
had
hoped
and
they
are
to
be
married
on
the
first
mr
abbey
exclaimed
carlton
catching
at
the
name
but
your
sister
is
going
to
marry
him
is
she
miss
morris
turned
her
head
in
some
surprise
yes
why
not
she
said
but
i
say
cried
carlton
i
thought
your
aunt
told
me
that
you
were
going
to
marry
abbey
she
told
me
so
that
day
on
the
steamer
when
he
came
to
see
you
off
i
marry
him
my
aunt
told
you
impossible
said
miss
morris
smiling
she
probably
said
that
niece
was
going
to
marry
him
she
meant
my
sister
they
had
been
engaged
some
time
then
who
are
you
going
to
marry
stammered
carlton
i
am
not
going
to
marry
any
one
said
miss
morris
carlton
stared
at
her
blankly
in
amazement
well
that
most
absurd
he
exclaimed
he
recognized
instantly
that
the
expression
was
hardly
adequate
but
he
could
not
readjust
his
mind
so
suddenly
to
the
new
idea
and
he
remained
looking
at
her
with
many
confused
memories
rushing
through
his
brain
a
dozen
questions
were
on
his
tongue
he
remembered
afterwards
how
he
had
noticed
a
servant
trimming
the
candle
in
one
of
the
lanterns
and
that
he
had
watched
him
as
he
disappeared
among
the
palms
the
silence
lasted
for
so
long
a
time
that
it
had
taken
on
a
significance
in
itself
which
carlton
recognized
he
pulled
himself
up
with
a
short
laugh
well
he
remonstrated
mirthlessly
i
think
you
treated
me
very
well
how
not
treated
you
very
well
miss
morris
asked
settling
herself
more
easily
she
had
been
sitting
during
the
pause
which
followed
carlton
discovery
with
a
certain
rigidity
as
if
she
was
on
a
strain
of
attention
but
her
tone
was
now
as
friendly
as
always
and
held
its
customary
suggestion
of
amusement
carlton
took
his
tone
from
it
although
his
mind
was
still
busily
occupied
with
incidents
and
words
of
hers
that
she
had
spoken
in
their
past
intercourse
not
fair
in
letting
me
think
you
were
engaged
he
said
i
wasted
so
much
time
i
not
half
civil
enough
to
engaged
girls
he
explained
you
been
quite
civil
enough
to
us
said
miss
morris
as
a
courier
philosopher
and
friend
i
very
sorry
we
have
to
part
company
part
company
exclaimed
carlton
in
sudden
alarm
but
i
say
we
must
do
that
but
we
must
you
see
said
miss
morris
we
must
go
back
for
the
wedding
and
you
will
have
to
follow
the
princess
aline
yes
of
course
carlton
heard
his
own
voice
say
i
had
forgotten
the
princess
aline
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
nor
of
the
princess
aline
he
was
thinking
of
the
many
hours
miss
morris
and
he
had
been
together
of
the
way
she
had
looked
at
certain
times
and
of
how
he
had
caught
himself
watching
her
at
others
how
he
had
pictured
the
absent
abbey
travelling
with
her
later
over
the
same
route
and
without
a
chaperon
sitting
close
at
her
side
or
holding
her
hand
and
telling
her
just
how
pretty
she
was
whenever
he
wished
to
do
so
and
without
any
fear
of
the
consequences
he
remembered
how
ready
she
had
been
to
understand
what
he
was
going
to
say
before
he
had
finished
saying
it
and
how
she
had
always
made
him
show
the
best
of
himself
and
had
caused
him
to
leave
unsaid
many
things
that
became
common
and
unworthy
when
considered
in
the
light
of
her
judgment
he
recalled
how
impatient
he
had
been
when
she
was
late
at
dinner
and
how
cross
he
was
throughout
one
whole
day
when
she
had
kept
her
room
he
felt
with
a
sudden
shock
of
delightful
fear
that
he
had
grown
to
depend
upon
her
that
she
was
the
best
companion
he
had
ever
known
and
he
remembered
moments
when
they
had
been
alone
together
at
the
table
or
in
some
old
palace
or
during
a
long
walk
when
they
had
seemed
to
have
the
whole
world
entirely
to
themselves
and
how
he
had
consoled
himself
at
such
times
with
the
thought
that
no
matter
how
long
she
might
be
abbey
wife
there
had
been
these
moments
in
her
life
which
were
his
with
which
abbey
had
had
nothing
to
do
carlton
turned
and
looked
at
her
with
strange
eyes
as
though
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
he
felt
so
sure
of
himself
and
of
his
love
for
her
that
the
happiness
of
it
made
him
tremble
and
the
thought
that
if
he
spoke
she
might
answer
him
in
the
old
friendly
mocking
tone
of
filled
him
with
alarm
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
carlton
that
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
for
them
to
do
would
be
to
go
back
again
together
over
the
road
they
had
come
seeing
everything
in
the
new
light
of
his
love
for
her
and
so
travel
on
and
on
for
ever
over
the
world
learning
to
love
each
other
more
and
more
each
succeeding
day
and
leaving
the
rest
of
the
universe
to
move
along
without
them
he
leaned
forward
with
his
arm
along
the
back
of
the
bench
and
bent
his
face
towards
hers
her
hand
lay
at
her
side
and
his
own
closed
over
it
but
the
shock
that
the
touch
of
her
fingers
gave
him
stopped
and
confused
the
words
upon
his
tongue
he
looked
strangely
at
her
and
could
not
find
the
speech
he
needed
miss
morris
gave
his
hand
a
firm
friendly
little
pressure
and
drew
her
own
away
as
if
he
had
taken
hers
only
in
an
exuberance
of
good
feeling
you
have
been
very
nice
to
us
she
said
with
an
effort
to
make
her
tone
sound
kindly
and
approving
and
we
you
must
go
i
ca
let
you
go
said
carlton
hoarsely
there
was
no
mistaking
his
tone
or
his
earnestness
now
if
you
go
he
went
on
breathlessly
i
must
go
with
you
the
girl
moved
restlessly
she
leaned
forward
and
drew
in
her
breath
with
a
slight
nervous
tremor
then
she
turned
and
faced
him
almost
as
though
she
were
afraid
of
him
or
of
herself
and
they
sat
so
for
an
instant
in
silence
the
air
seemed
to
have
grown
close
and
heavy
and
carlton
saw
her
dimly
in
the
silence
he
heard
the
splash
of
the
fountain
behind
them
and
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
in
the
night
wind
and
the
low
sighing
murmur
of
a
waltz
he
raised
his
head
to
listen
and
she
saw
in
the
moonlight
that
he
was
smiling
it
was
as
though
he
wished
to
delay
any
answer
she
might
make
to
his
last
words
that
is
the
waltz
he
said
still
speaking
in
a
whisper
that
the
gypsies
played
that
night
he
stopped
and
miss
morris
answered
him
by
bending
her
head
slowly
in
assent
it
seemed
to
be
an
effort
for
her
to
even
make
that
slight
gesture
you
do
remember
it
said
carlton
it
meant
nothing
to
you
i
mean
that
night
on
the
steamer
when
i
told
you
what
love
meant
to
other
people
what
a
fool
i
was
he
said
with
an
uncertain
laugh
yes
i
remember
it
she
said
last
thursday
night
on
the
steamer
thursday
night
exclaimed
carlton
indignantly
wednesday
night
tuesday
night
how
should
i
know
what
night
of
the
week
it
was
it
was
the
night
of
my
life
to
me
that
night
i
knew
that
i
loved
you
as
i
had
never
hoped
to
care
for
any
one
in
this
world
when
i
told
you
that
i
did
not
know
what
love
meant
i
felt
all
the
time
that
i
was
lying
i
knew
that
i
loved
you
and
that
i
could
never
love
any
one
else
and
that
i
had
never
loved
any
one
before
and
if
i
had
thought
then
you
could
care
for
me
your
engagement
or
your
promises
would
never
have
stopped
my
telling
you
so
you
said
that
night
that
i
would
learn
to
love
all
the
better
and
more
truly
for
having
doubted
myself
so
long
and
oh
edith
he
cried
taking
both
her
hands
and
holding
them
close
in
his
own
i
can
not
let
you
go
now
i
love
you
so
laugh
at
me
do
mock
at
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
depends
on
you
and
then
miss
morris
laughed
softly
just
as
he
had
begged
her
not
to
do
but
her
laughter
was
so
full
of
happiness
and
came
so
gently
and
sweetly
and
spoke
so
truly
of
content
that
though
he
let
go
of
her
hands
with
one
of
his
it
was
only
that
he
might
draw
her
to
him
until
her
face
touched
his
and
she
felt
the
strength
of
his
arm
as
he
held
her
against
his
breast
the
hohenwalds
occupied
the
suite
of
rooms
on
the
first
floor
of
the
hotel
with
the
privilege
of
using
the
broad
balcony
that
reached
out
from
it
over
the
front
entrance
and
at
the
time
when
downs
and
edith
morris
and
carlton
drove
up
to
the
hotel
from
the
ball
the
princess
aline
was
leaning
over
the
balcony
and
watching
the
lights
go
out
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
the
moonlight
as
it
fell
on
the
trees
and
statues
in
the
public
park
below
her
foot
was
still
in
bandages
and
she
was
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
to
keep
her
from
the
cold
inside
of
the
open
windows
that
led
out
on
to
the
balcony
her
sisters
were
taking
off
their
ornaments
and
discussing
the
incidents
of
the
night
just
over
the
princess
aline
unnoticed
by
those
below
saw
carlton
help
downs
to
alight
from
the
carriage
and
then
give
his
hand
to
another
muffled
figure
that
followed
her
and
while
downs
was
ascending
the
steps
and
before
the
second
muffled
figure
had
left
the
shadow
of
the
carriage
and
stepped
into
the
moonlight
the
princess
aline
saw
carlton
draw
her
suddenly
back
and
kiss
her
lightly
on
the
cheek
and
heard
a
protesting
gasp
and
saw
miss
morris
pull
her
cloak
over
her
head
and
run
up
the
steps
then
she
saw
carlton
shake
hands
with
them
and
stand
for
a
moment
after
they
had
disappeared
gazing
up
at
the
moon
and
fumbling
in
the
pockets
of
his
coat
he
drew
out
a
and
leisurely
selected
a
cigar
and
with
much
apparent
content
lighted
it
and
then
with
his
head
thrown
back
and
his
chest
expanded
as
though
he
were
challenging
the
world
he
strolled
across
the
street
and
disappeared
among
the
shadows
of
the
deserted
park
the
princess
walked
back
to
one
of
the
open
windows
and
stood
there
leaning
against
the
side
that
young
carlton
the
artist
she
said
to
her
sisters
is
engaged
to
that
beautiful
american
girl
we
met
the
other
day
really
said
the
elder
sister
i
thought
it
was
probable
who
told
you
i
saw
him
kiss
her
said
the
princess
stepping
into
the
window
as
they
got
out
of
their
carriage
just
now
the
princess
aline
stood
for
a
moment
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
and
then
walked
across
the
room
to
a
little
she
unlocked
a
drawer
in
this
and
took
from
it
two
slips
of
paper
which
she
folded
in
her
hand
then
she
returned
slowly
across
the
room
and
stepped
out
again
on
to
the
balcony
one
of
the
pieces
of
paper
held
the
picture
carlton
had
drawn
of
her
and
under
which
he
had
written
this
is
she
do
you
wonder
i
travelled
four
thousand
miles
to
see
her
and
the
other
was
the
picture
of
carlton
himself
which
she
had
cut
out
of
the
catalogue
of
the
salon
from
the
edge
of
the
balcony
where
the
princess
stood
she
could
see
the
glimmer
of
carlton
white
linen
and
the
red
glow
of
his
cigar
as
he
strode
proudly
up
and
down
the
path
of
the
public
park
like
a
sentry
keeping
watch
she
folded
the
pieces
of
paper
together
and
tore
them
slowly
into
tiny
fragments
and
let
them
fall
through
her
fingers
into
the
street
below
then
she
returned
again
to
the
room
and
stood
looking
at
her
sisters
do
you
know
she
said
i
think
i
am
a
little
tired
of
travelling
so
much
i
want
to
go
back
to
grasse
she
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
held
it
there
for
a
moment
i
think
i
am
a
little
homesick
said
the
princess
aline
the
end
